WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND CALL TO ORDER THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE. HEARING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ASSEMBLY SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER FIVE ON PUBLIC SAFETY. AND SENATE COMMITTEE NUMBER. FIVE SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER FIVE ON CORRECTIONS PUBLIC SAFETY IS TO JUST HURRY. AS YOU KNOW THIS MONTH IS SEXUAL AWARENESS AND PREVENTION AWARENESS MONTH -- THIS MORNING WE WILL DISCUSS THE NEED FOR TESTING SEXUAL SALTS EVIDENCE KIDS AS WELL AS THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR. AUDITS -- RELATED TO SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE GETS THE FIRST REPORT WAS RELEASED IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY FOURTEEN TITLED SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS. ALTHOUGH TESTING ALL KIDS COULD BENEFIT SEXUAL ASSAULT INVESTIGATIONS THE EXTENT OF THE BENEFIT IS UNKNOWN. MORE RECENTLY IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR THE STATE AUDITOR ISSUED A SECOND OUT OF REPORT FOLLOW UP SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS. TITLED. CALIFORNIA IS NOT OBTAINED THE CASE HOW COME INFORMATION THAT WOULD MORE FULLY DEMONSTRATE THE BENEFITS OF ITS RAPID DNA SERVICE PROGRAM. WILL ALSO DISCUSS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES PLANTS IMPLEMENT CHANGES AND CORRECTIVE. ACTIONS TO ENSURE TRACKING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF ALL SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE GETS. I LIKE SHARE SOME STATISTICS -- FROM THE FBI AND CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION -- A SEXUAL ASSAULT OCCURS EVERY ON AVERAGE EVERY NINETY TWO SECONDS. A FORCIBLE RAPE OCCURS EVERY SIX POINT TWO MINUTES. WITHIN THE UNITED STATES NEARLY ONE IN FIVE WOMEN. AND ONE IN SEVENTY ONE MAN HAVE BEEN RAPED AT SOMETIME IN THEIR LIVES. RATES OF VICTIMIZATION BY SEXUAL ASSAULT VERY AMONG ETHNIC GROUPS APPROXIMATELY ONE IN FIVE BLACK WOMEN OR 22% ONE IN SEVEN HISPANIC WOMEN FOURTEEN POINT 6%. AND MORE THAN ONE IN 427% OF WOMEN IDENTIFIED AS AMERICAN INDIAN OR ALASKA NATIVE REPORTED RAPE IN THEIR LIFETIMES. WITH THE STATISTICS IN MIND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF FORENSIC DNA AS A TOOL TO HELP SOLVE AND PREVENT CRIME AND BRING JUSTICE TO VICTIMS. YET FAR TOO FEW SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES ARE RESOLVED BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ONLY 50% OF FORCIBLE RAPES ARE REPORTED AND OF THE REPORTED RATE. REPORTED CRIMES ONLY ABOUT ONE QUARTER LEAD TO AN ARREST. VAST MAJORITY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS THEN DO NOT SEE THEIR OFFENDERS BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. IN PART BECAUSE A LARGE NUMBER OF SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KIDS REMAINED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT CUSTODY. AND I'M NOT BEEN SENT TO CRIED LABS FOR ANALYSIS. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A NUMBER OF BILLS TARGETING THE SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS BACKLOG. WE ALSO APPROPRIATED SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION IN THE STATE BUDGET TO TEST RICKETS. TODAY HOME OPENER DISCOVER. THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS IN ORDER TO GAUGE THE APPROPRIATE NEXT STEPS AND THE BUDGET NEEDS. THE TWO ARE REPORTS WE ARE FOCUSED ON TODAY LOOK AT THE PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE GETS BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND THEIR ASSOCIATED CRIME LABS AS WELL AS THE REPORTING AND TRACKING OF CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND AND FOR PORTS RAPID DNA SERVICES. THE OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTEEN AUDIT FOUND. A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ALL OF THE UNDER EXPLAINED. AND WITH THAT LET ME GO TO JUST MOVING THANK THE MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE -- SEE IF ANYONE HAS OPENING COMMENTS I THINK IT WAS WEBER FOR JOINING US MR LACKEY AND MISS RUBIO. BILLION THIS RUBIO HAS A SELECT COMMITTEE ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE -- THIS WEBER IS THE CHAIR OF OF A SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND MISTER LACKEY HAS A EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. FROM HIS PREVIOUS. TIME. SO WITH THAT. AND WE LIKE TO MAKE OPENING COMMENTS IF NOT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO OUR FIRST PANEL. MISS WEBER PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AN MEMBERS -- I WANT TO THANK OUR AUDITOR FOR ONCE AGAIN PROVIDING US WITH SOME VERY GOOD INFORMATION AND A GOOD ANALYSIS THAT'S HERE -- IT'S SOMEWHAT DISHEARTENING -- TO SEE THE LACK OF PROGRESS WE'VE MADE AND I THINK WE HAVE TO VERY SERIOUSLY BEGIN TO LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING SO I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IS SO. YOU KNOW WE TALK A LOT ABOUT DNA AND VARIOUS OTHER KINDS OF THINGS ON TELEVISION. AND AND YET OF OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SCIENCE AND TO MARRY IT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IS MOST ALARMING. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF RAPES THAT OCCUR IN THE STATE AND TO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SOMEWHAT POWERLESS -- WHO ARE VICTIMS OF IT SO I'M I'M HOPING TO HEAR MORE FROM YOU I APPRECIATE THE DUE TO REPORTS AND? IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE I WAS READING THE SAME REPORT OVER AGAIN UNFORTUNATELY -- AT AT SCHOOL KEEP GOING BACK AND LOOKING AT THE DATES DOES HE WHERE I WAS IN THE IN IN THE PERSPECTIVE BUT I THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND I THINK IT CALLS ALL OF US TO TO ACTION AND I THINK IT SOME SERIOUS ACTION THAT WILL HAVE TO TAKE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING. THANK YOU. FOR THANK YOU I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR FOR PROVIDING THE INFORMATION AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT LIKE DR WEBER SAID IS WE TALK ABOUT SCIENCE AND HOW VALUABLE IT IS EXCEPT. WE'RE NOT USING IT AND I THINK -- HOPEFULLY THIS WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS IS BETTER OVERSIGHT AND MAKING SURE THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE AUDITOR ARE FOLLOWED THROUGH BY THE DEPARTMENT SO. I APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION BUT YOU'RE RIGHT DOCTOR WEBER I KEPT LOOKING AT IT THINKING IT WAS THE SAME APART. AND A AND IT'S A TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN REPORT AND HERE WE ARE IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND FIVE YEARS LATER WE HAVEN'T REALLY MADE ANY PROGRESS. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH COMMITTEE ON TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO HOLD -- THE DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTABLE SO THAT WE CAN -- PROCEED AND REALLY USE THE THE THE DNA AS A TOOL TO HELP ON SOME OF THE VICTIMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MR LACKEY. YOU I'VE. SKEWS ME I WANT TO THANK THE AUDITOR FOR HELPING US GATHER DATA WE'VE KNOWN THIS IS BEEN A PROBLEM EVER SINCE I'VE ELECTED US WAS JUST INDICATED. BUT IT'S TIME TO QUIT TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND AND START LOOKING AT THE SOLUTIONS AND GOOD DATA HELPS US DO THAT. SO THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING US THE THE PATHWAY THAT WE NEED TO HELP SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY VICTIMS IT DESERVES SOME JUSTICE MAY NOW BE ABLE TO GET SOME OF THAT THANK YOU [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU I THINK THAT'S A GOAL OF TODAY'S HEARING IS NOT ONLY FINDING OUT WHAT HAPPENS IS A TWENTY FOURTEEN BUT ALSO WITH THE UPDATE THAT JUST WAS RELEASED. ABOUT A MONTH AGO I BELIEVE. AND THE LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE TO HELP I DE CORRECTLY IDENTIFY AND RESOLVE THESE ISSUES SO WITH THAT LET'S GO TO BEGIN WITH -- OUR FIRST PENALTY OVERVIEW OF THE AUDIT FINDINGS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. WE HAVE -- MISSILE IN HOW THE STATE AUDITOR. AND I BELIEVE -- MISTER BOB HARRIS PUTS WATER AND AMANDA MELON SENIOR AFTER THANK YOU WHEN YOU'RE READY PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHAIR WEBER. MR LACKEY AND AND MISS RUBIO IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S ELAINE HOW CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AS AS MANY OF YOU JUST MENTIONED WE'VE ISSUED TWO REPORTS. THE FIRST REPORT WAS A AN AUDIT THAT WAS REQUESTED BY SENATOR CORBETT -- WE SHOULD REPORT IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY FOURTEEN IN THAT AUDIT WE WE WENT AND LOOKED AT SOME LOCALITIES. SACRAMENTO OAKLAND AND SAN DIEGO TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE ACTUALLY UNTESTED. A SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS -- AT THOSE VARIOUS LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES AND WE FOUND CERTAINLY THERE WERE -- AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT SOME OF THEIR RATIONALE WITH RESPECT TO DECISIONS THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCRETION. ON THE PART OF INVESTIGATORS AT THOSE PARTICULAR ENTITIES TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO FORWARD. THAT PARTICULAR EVIDENCE TO A LAB TO HAVE IT TESTED MISTER HARRIS WILL GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE FIRST AUDIT REPORT AND WHAT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE. ALSO IN THE FIRST AUDIT REPORT WE SPENT SOME TIME AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND REALLY LOOKED AT WHAT WE FELT WAS VERY PROMISING PROGRAM -- AND WE STILL BELIEVE IT'S A VERY PROMISING PROGRAM AND CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S THAT RAPID DNA SERVICE PROGRAM WHERE -- DEPARTMENT JUSTICE HAS LABS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT CAN REALLY PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL ENTITIES TO ALLOW LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER ENTITIES TO GET THOSE KIDS TESTED. GET THEM TESTED RELATIVELY QUICKLY SO THAT WE DO HAVE THE INFORMATION AS A STATE TO EITHER PROSECUTE AN INDIVIDUAL BUT CERTAINLY ALSO HAVE MORE AND MORE INFORMATION -- TO SUPPORT THE THE NOTION THAT TESTING ALL KIDS IS BENEFICIAL SO YOU WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT TESTING THESE KIDS ULTIMATELY IDENTIFIED A PERPETRATOR -- THAT PERSON WAS CONVICTED AND PERHAPS HAS COULD ACT COMMITTED OTHER OFFENSES SO THIS INFORMATION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE SO AT THE TIME WE SHOULD THE REPORT AND TWENTY FOURTEEN IT WAS A PILOT PROGRAM THEY WERE WORKING WITH ABOUT NINE COUNTIES. WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE FOLLOW UP? AND WE WAITED A FEW YEARS TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND MISTER HARRIS WILL TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT BUT WHEN WE WENT BACK OUT IN IN -- LATE LAST YEAR -- AN ISSUE THE REPORT IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR THEY CERTAINLY HAVE EXPANDED THE PROGRAM TO MORE COUNTIES BUT WE STILL AREN'T SEEING THOSE ENTITIES REPORTING INFORMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SO THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE HAS. INFORMATION STATEWIDE ABOUT THE BENEFITS -- AND SOME OF THE OUTCOMES RELATED TO DECISIONS -- AND TESTING THESE PARTICULAR KIDS SO I CERTAINLY A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M GONNA HAND OVER TO MISTER HARRIS HE'LL TALK ABOUT THE FIRST REPORT. AND THEN MS MELON WAS THE SUPERVISOR ON THE SECOND REPORT WORKING WITH MISTER HARRIS SO SHE WILL GET INTO MORE SPECIFICS ON THE FOLLOW UP WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT THAT RADS PROGRAM THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ADMINISTERS SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR I'LL I'LL HANDED OVER MISTER HARRIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IS MY NAME IS BOB HERE SOME OUT OF PRINCIPLE WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND AS THE STATE AUDITOR INDICATED -- I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN BOTH OF OUR AUDITS BUT THE TWENTY FOURTEEN AUDIT AND THE FOLLOW UP ON IT THAT WE RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR -- I'M GOING TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE AUDITS -- AND OUR REVIEW OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BUT ALSO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- AND SOME OF THE KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE ORIGINAL OUGHTA AND SOME OF THE INFORMATION GATHERING EFFORTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED SINCE THEN MS MELLON MORE THAN COVER OUR FOLLOW UP ON IT. AND THE RELATED RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME OUT OF THAT AUDIT. NOW I'M REALLY OUR MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS FROM THE ORIGINAL ON IT -- AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL RELATED TO A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS WE REALLY FOUND THAT THERE WAS -- NO INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MANY OF THOSE KIDS EXISTED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW MANY OF THEM WERE BEING SUBMITTED FOR ANALYSIS AND WHAT HAPPENS AS A RESULT OF THAT ANALYSIS -- THOSE WERE THE KEY AREAS WHERE WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THERE BE MORE INFORMATION GATHERING. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND THOUGH A SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KID IS THE BY PRODUCT OF A VICTIM WHO REPORTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT THE SIDING TO UNDERGO AN INVASIVE MEDICAL EXAMINATION. DURING THAT EXAM A TRAINED MEDICAL EXAMINER WILL ATTEMPT TO COLLECT EVIDENCE FROM THE VICTIM'S BODY THAT HOPEFULLY WILL CONTAIN A DNA PROFILE RELATED TO THE SUSPECT IN THE INVESTIGATION. THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY VERY VALUABLE TO THE INVESTIGATORS AND THE PROSECUTORS OF IN THAT CASE BUT IT'S ONLY ACCESSIBLE TO THEM IF THEY THEN SUBMIT THAT KIT TO A CRIME LAB FOR ANALYSIS -- CRIME LABS WHEN THEY ANALYZE A SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KIT THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO ATTAIN THAT DNA PROFILE FOR FOR A SUSPECT IN THE INVESTIGATION AND IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING THAT THEY CAN UPLOAD THE PROFILE TO WHAT IS KNOWN AS CODIS WHICH IS THE COMBINED DNA INDEX SYSTEM. CURTIS IS A NETWORK OF DATABASES THAT STRETCHES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE CONTAINS DENY PROFILES FOR MULTIPLE MANY MANY INDIVIDUALS. AND THE HOPE IS THAT WHEN YOU UPLOAD A DNA PROFILE FROM AN EVIDENCE KIT INTO CODIS. BUT IT WILL THEN MATCH AGAINST ANOTHER PROFILE THAT'S ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM AND COULD POTENTIALLY PROVIDE YOU THE NAME OF THE SUSPECT -- IN ONE PARTICULAR CASE WE REVIEWED DURING THE FOLLOW ABOUT IT WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TOOK. THE STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THEM BY THE VICTIM COMBINED WITH A HIT WHICH IS WHAT THAT MATCHES CALLED FROM THE CODIS SYSTEM THAT NAME TO THE SUSPECT. AND IN COMBINATION THOSE TWO PIECES OF EVIDENCE WERE CRITICAL TO THEM ARRESTING THE SUSPECT AND FORWARDING THE CASE TO THE PROSECUTOR FOR PROSECUTION. SO IT'S REALLY VALUABLE EVIDENCE I'M IN INFORMATION THAT INVESTIGATORS COULD HAVE ACCESS TO BUT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO UNLESS THEY MAKE THAT SUBMITTAL TO A CRIME LAB. IN OUR ORIGINAL AUDIT REPORT WE REVIEWED THREE AGENCIES AS THE STATE AUDITOR INDICATED. NOT ALL OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS AT THOSE AGENCIES HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE CRIME LABS. IT WAS RIGHT AROUND 50% OF THE TIME WE CONDUCTED THE ORIGINAL AUDIT THAT'S WHAT OUR REVIEW SHOWED ABOUT 50% HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND ABOUT 50% HAD NOT BEEN SUBMITTED. AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATORS ARE PROVIDED AS A VARIETY OF REASONS FOR WHY THEY DIDN'T FOR THE THE EVIDENCE GETS TO THE CRIME LABS FOR ANALYSIS. BUT AS I SAID BEFORE STATEWIDE THERE'S NO DATA OR THERE WAS NO DATA THEN AND THERE IS NO DATA NOW. ON HOW MANY OF THOSE KIDS EXISTS STATEWIDE. HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND AND A KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION IS WHAT ARE THE REASONS WHY KIDS ARE NOT BEING SUBMITTED TO CRIME LABS AS I MENTIONED THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WE VISITED GAVE US REASONS SUCH AS? HAVING BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ARREST A SUSPECT WITHOUT THE KID AN ANALYSIS OR HAVING DETERMINED THAT -- THE ISSUE WAS ONE OF CONSENT WHICH IS AN ISSUE THEY FEEL LIKE IT'S NOT RESOLVABLE THROUGH DNA EVIDENCE. BUT REGARDLESS WE DON'T HAVE STATEWIDE DATA ON WHETHER THOSE OF THE REASONS STATEWIDE FOR WHY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. SO KEY RECOMMENDATION FROM OUR ORIGINAL AUDIT REPORT WAS THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE REPORTING OF THAT INFORMATION THOSE THREE KEY DATA POINTS. HOW MANY KIDS EXIST HOW MANY OF BEEN SUBMITTED AND NOT SUBMITTED FOR TESTING? AND THEN THE REASONS WHY KIDS WERE NOT TURNED IN FOR TESTING -- THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED THAT RECOMMENDATION THAT IS NOW STATE LAW AND THE FIRST REPORT ON THE OF LOCALS TO JUSTICE. AND THAT JUSTICE IS REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE IS DUE SOMETIME SOON SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT -- IMPORTANT AND VITAL -- INFORMATION ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE GETS SOON IN TERMS OF HOW MANY EXIST. REAL QUICKLY THOUGH BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO MISS MEL IN OUR SECOND KEY RECOMMENDATION WAS RELATED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S RADS PROGRAM. THAT PROGRAM IS UNIQUE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT IS THE STATE'S FUND THE STATE FUNDED PROGRAM TO TEST ALL SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS. AND THAT PROGRAM THE KIDS GO FROM THE MEDICAL EXAMINER STRAIGHT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CRIME LAB THEY DON'T PASSED THROUGH THE INVESTIGATOR SO THAT THE INVESTIGATOR DECIDES WHETHER TO FOUR DIFFERENT ALICE'S OR NOT. THAT KEY DIFFERENCE MAYES THE MADE THE PROGRAM UNIQUE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THEN STILL MAKES IT UNIQUE TODAY AS THE STATE'S FUNDING THAT PROGRAM. AND WE SAW THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO COLLECT INFORMATION THAT GOES BEYOND JUST WHETHER THE KITS WERE TESTED OR NOT BUT ALSO WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS WHAT KIND OF POSITIVE CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION COULD WE LEARN ABOUT THOSE CASES WERE SUSPECTS ARRESTED AS A RESULT OF THAT ANALYSIS. WERE THEY CONVICTED AS A RESULT OF THAT ANALYSIS. SO WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE COLLECT THAT INFORMATION FROM ALL OF THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN ITS RATS PROGRAM. AND THEN REPORT THAT INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE AGAIN INCREASING THE AVAILABLE STATEWIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE KIDS. NOW IN THE YEARS SINCE WE'VE DONE OUR ORIGINAL AUDIT THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE HAS AT LEAST AMENDED ITS AGREEMENTS WITH THE AGENCIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE RATS PROGRAM. TO ASK THEM TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION BUT FOR A FEW YEARS NOW WE HAVEN'T SEEN JUSTICE ACTUALLY PROVIDE THAT CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT'S WHAT PROMPTED OUR FOLLOW UP EFFORT. AND THAT'S THE EFFORT THAT MISS MELONS GOING TO DESCRIBE YOU KNOW. THANK YOU MORNING HI MY NAME IS AMANDA MILLEN AND AGAIN I WAS THE AUDIT SUPERVISOR ON THE FOLLOW UP ON IT. SO DURING OUR FOLLOW UP WE FOUND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ON CASE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HITS THAT IT PROVIDED. IT HAD NO INFORMATION WHATSOEVER ABOUT 67% OF THOSE CASES MEANING IT DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER SOMEONE HAD BEEN CONVICTED WHETHER SOMEONE HAD BEEN ARRESTED OR EVEN WHETHER INVESTIGATORS HAD EVEN INVESTIGATED THOSE HITS. AND AS A RESULT IN HAVE THAT INFORMATION TO PROVIDE TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND WE FOUND THAT THE REASON THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION IS THAT IT HAD MADE A LACKLUSTER EFFORT TO OBTAIN THAT INFORMATION. WE FOUND THAT IT HADN'T EVEN TOLD MOST RATS PARTICIPANTS THAT THEY SHOULD PROVIDE THE INFORMATION. IT HADN'T TRAIN MOST READ PARTICIPANTS ON HOW TO REPORT THAT INFORMATION AND HADN'T PROVIDED GUIDANCE ON HOW TO REPORT THAT. AND WE FOUND IN THE LIMITED DATA THAT JUSTICE DID HAVE INACCURACIES AN OUTDATED INFORMATION AS A RESULT OF THAT. AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THIS JUSTICE MISS A VERY REAL OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION. THAT COULD BE HELPFUL IN THE EFFORT TO FURTHER SEXUAL ASSAULT INVESTIGATIONS. MORE THAN THAT WE FOUND THAT CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION WOULD BE A VERY HELPFUL TOOL. IN THE EFFORT TO IMPROVE SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE INVESTIGATIONS EVEN IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES MANDATE THAT ALL SEXUAL ASSAULT KIT SHOULD BE TESTED. AND THAT'S BECAUSE CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION COULD SHOW US WHAT BARRIERS ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE PREVENTING SEXUAL ASSAULT INVESTIGATIONS FROM HAPPENING. RECENT RESEARCH INTO THE REASONS WHY SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS ARE NOT TESTED WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN TESTED. HAVE FOUND A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS THEY FOUND THAT THERE ARE IMPLICIT BIASES AND SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT PREDISPOSE THEM TO NOT BELIEVING A VICTIM OR TO ADD BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS -- IT IS ALSO SHOWN THAT THERE'S JUST A LACK OF INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES AT A LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO INVESTIGATE CASES. INCLUDING SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES THOSE BARRIERS DO NOT GO AWAY WHEN THE KID IS TESTED. THOSE BARRIERS CAN AND DO STILL PREVENT SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES FROM BEING INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED EVEN AFTER THERE IS A HIT -- SO FOR EXAMPLE. THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RECENTLY ISSUED SEVERAL GRANTS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE NATION. TO ADDRESS ON TESTING KITS THREE CITIES RECEIVED GRANTS. TO ADDRESS NOT UNTESTED KITS BUT TO ADDRESS HITS THAT THEY GOT FROM TESTED KIDS BECAUSE THEY NOW HAD A BACKLOG OF HITS RATHER THAN KIDS ONE OF THOSE CITIES IS FRESNO CALIFORNIA. FRESNO HAS SEVEN HUNDRED HITS SITTING ON ITS SHELVES GOING ON INVESTIGATED BECAUSE BEFORE THEY GOT THE GRANT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO INVESTIGATE THOSE HITS. AND THAT CAN HAVE DEVASTATING REPERCUSSIONS WELL WE HEARD RECENTLY ABOUT A CASE OUT OF NORTH CAROLINA WERE A LITTLE THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WAS RAPED AND MURDERED AND HER BODY WAS DITCH ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. AND THEY FOUND OUT THAT THE PERSON THAT THEY ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH THAT CRIME HAD TWO YEARS EARLIER. AT COMMITTED AN ADDITIONAL RAPE WHERE THEY HAD A HIT. OUT OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT KIT COMING FROM THAT RAPE AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN NORTH CAROLINA SAID IF THEY HAD FOLLOWED UP ON THAT HIT THAT LITTLE GIRL WOULD PROBABLY STILL BE ALIVE TODAY. THAT CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. BUT CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION OR THE TOOLS RIGHT NOW TO IDENTIFY WHERE WE'RE AT RISK OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENING WE WOULD NOT KNOW ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IT FRESNO IF NOT FOR THAT GRANT PROGRAM IF WE HADN'T GONE DOWN THERE AND TALK TO THEM. BUT CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION CAN PROVIDE THAT TOOL. TO ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY THOSE ISSUES IT WOULD SHOW US WHERE WE HAVE. A BUNCH OF HITS THAT HAVE GONE ON INVESTIGATED IT WAS SHOW US WHERE THERE HAS BEEN AN INVESTIGATION BUT THERE'S BEEN NO ARRESTS MADE. IT WOULD SHOW US WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS SUBMITTED A BUNCH OF CASES THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY BUT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS NOT FILED ANY CHARGES. YOU WOULD BE A POWERFUL TOOL IN PROVIDING A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT WE COULD USE TO IDENTIFY AND REMOVE THE UNDERLYING BARRIERS THAT PREVENT SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES FOR BEING. EFFECTIVELY INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED AND FOR THAT REASON WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IF IT DOES REQUIRE THAT ALL SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS IN THE STATE BE TESTED. THAT INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES REPORT CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT ALREADY COLLECTS INFORMATION ON SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES. AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PUBLISHED SUMMARY INFORMATION -- ON THAT DATA. SO THAT'S THIS THAT'S OUR FINDINGS BUT IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WE HAVE ANSWERED THEM. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY AND YOU KNOW. THE WAY IT'S FRAME I THINK -- JUST READING THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE -- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WONDERING. WELL MAYBE THIS WEBER AND SUBCOMMITTEE. WE CAN FIND OUT WHERE THE SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION THAT WE ALLOCATED PREVIOUSLY -- HAS GONE IN. HI THIS BE UTILIZED. SINCE ARE STILL BEING OUT THERE SO QUESTIONS BUT LET ME JUST. ASK SO TALL CASE INFORMATION. THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR THE FOR THE OUTCOMES AND THE METHODOLOGIES THAT YOU LOOKED AT BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT -- LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS IS AGENCIES WAS IS CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL OF THEM OR THEY ALL KIND OF DIFFERENT -- YEP STRIVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW SYSTEMIC THIS IS. GIVEN THAT WE DIDN'T -- GO THROUGH EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO ACTUALLY SEE WHICH ONES FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE KIDS WHICH ONES DID NOT AND REASONS WHY. THEY GOT MISTERS TALKED ABOUT MAYBE SOME -- OR MAYBE IT WAS YOU. MISSPELLING ABOUT THE IMPLICIT BIASES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO WE DIDN'T LOOK INTO THE POTENTIAL THAT THERE WERE ANY IMPLICIT BIASES AT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WE VISITED THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE WERE DOING THERE. WE REALLY WENT THERE TO SEE WHAT INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT JUSTICE IT SAID THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION BEING REPORTED. WAS BECAUSE THOSE CASES HADN'T PROGRESSED FAR ENOUGH ALONG FOR THERE TO EVEN BE CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WENT DOWN TO THE THREE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IS TO FIND OUT IS THAT TRUE DO THEY REALLY HAVE A REALLY NOT GOT ANY CASE THAT COMES TO PROVIDE. AND WE FOUND THAT THAT WASN'T TRUE MOST OF THE TIME ALMOST ALL OF THE CASES THEY HAD SOME CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION. SO THAT'S WHY WE WENT DOWN THERE WE DIDN'T EVALUATE THE REASONABLENESS OF THEIR DECISIONS TO HALT AN INVESTIGATION OR TO PUSH AN INVESTIGATION FORWARD. WHILE WE WERE THERE AND PLACE FOR THEM THE INPUT THAT INFORMATION WOULD THAT BE INTO THE RATS PROGRAM. YES YES SO THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE IS TO ESTABLISH A DATABASE CALLED THE CHOP DATABASE -- THAT'S WHERE THEY HAVE ASKED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO REPORT THE CASE COME INFORMATION -- AS MISSPELLING COVERED THOUGH EARLIER WE FOUND THERE'S REALLY A LACK OF INFORMATION IN THAT DATABASE AND EVEN WHAT'S THERE IS -- NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE. OKAY YES MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE ANY. QUESTIONS. THIS WEBER PLACE CLEARLY -- I REMEMBER THE LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRED US TO HAVE ALL KIDS TESTED YOU KNOW AND I I I I FEEL LIKE I'M. DEAL WITH MY CHILDREN WHEN YOU TELL THEM TO DO ONE THING AND THEY DO THAT ONE THING. AND IN THE PROCESS SO WOULD TIM THINGS SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE THAT BUT THEY JUST DID THE ONE THAT I TOLD THEM. AND YOU JUST AS SOON WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT WORD ALSO MEANS A SO -- IT IS IT IS AMAZING THAT WE ARE. AT THIS POINT AFTER THESE YEARS AT THAT THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT TO WHERE WE WERE OUTRAGED ABOUT THE KIDS NOT BEING TESTED. BUT NOW WE'RE GETTING THEM TESTED BUT THAT WILL NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH MUCH ELSE OTHER THAN THAT. OF ESPECIALLY IF WE THINK ABOUT AND NOT ONLY FINDING THE PERPETRATORS WHO DONE SOME CRIMES BUT POSSIBLY EVEN HAVING PEOPLE THAT WE'VE CONVICTED. THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONVICTED IN A LAB THE HORROR OF THAT ALONE IS A PERSON BEING ACCUSED OF SOMETHING AND HAVING THEIR LIVES COMPLETELY DISRUPTED. FOR FOR YEARS ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THERE'S DNA THAT COULD HAVE SAID THIS PERSON DID NOT DO IT. THAT IS MOST ALARMING TO ME -- AND SO I'D -- I THINK WE'VE TAKEN THE CHARGE MY STAFF IS HERE -- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY DO SOMETHING IN THE BUDGET WITH THE MONEY THAT WE'VE GIVEN THEM PUT SOME STIPULATIONS ON IT. WITH REGARDS TO REPORTING AND AND GETTING INFORMATION BACK TO US BUT IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THESE THINGS AVAILABLE AND WE DON'T HAVE SEEN THE ENERGY OR THE DESIRE AS YOU POINTED OUT. THE LACK OF THE LACK LUSTER METHOD IN WHICH WE JUST KINDA OF TAKE THE INFORMATION AND NOT FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IT WHEN WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL. TO DO AN AWFUL LOT OF THINGS AND TO PREVENT SOME CRIMES TO AS WELL SO I I IT IS VERY ALARMING -- GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE PUT INTO THIS PROJECT TO TO GET THESE KIDS TESTED TO DISCOVER THAT. THERE'S VERY LITTLE HAPPENING WITH ME AFTERWARDS VERY ALARMING BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOROUGHNESS. YEAH. GIVE SOMEONE NUMBER LACKEY. THE MOST ALARMING THING TO ME IS NOT THE MONEY SPENT BUT IT'S IT'S THE THE IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES I MEAN AS YOU TALK. ABOUT THE TRAGEDY WITH THAT YOUNG LADY THE VERY NATURE OF THIS CRIME IS THAT IT. THE PERPETUATES. I CONTINUES AND SO THAT'S THE URGENCY THAT ALL AGENCIES INVOLVED SHOULD BE. ENGAGED IN AT AND THEY SHOULD. CERTAINLY HAVE A GRASP ON I DON'T. HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS COULD BE SO DRASTICALLY -- ALARMING IT REALLY IS. THIS IS A HUGE PRIORITY IN MY MIND THAT THAT SHOULD BE FOLLOWED UP ON AND THE COORDINATION IS WHERE THE PROBLEM IS. I MEAN YOU HAVE PEOPLE DOING WHAT THEY THINK THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO. AND BEYOND THAT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH COORDINATION GOING INVOLVED -- THEY'RE JUST ASSUMING AND THERE'S A LOT OF ASSUMPTION AS INDICATED THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO DO -- I JUST HOPE THAT WE ACT NOW NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS DADDO WE WE NEED IT'S UP TO US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE OVERSEE BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF OUR JOBS IS TO OVERSEE AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE. DOING WHAT IS EXPECTED AND FORTUNE UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THERE'S A BIG GAP AND WHAT'S BEING ACCOMPLISHED WHAT SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED AS IT. RELATES THIS IS EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT THIS IS EVIDENCE -- IT'S NOT JUST. NEBULOUS INFORMATION THIS IS VERY VERY TARGETED. AND SO WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO REALLY USE THAT INFORMATION. TO MAKE GOOD OUTCOMES AND TO PREVENT TRAGEDY THAT'S THE HOPE IS PREVENTION NOT NECESSARILY JUST. MEETING OUT PUNISHMENT BUT PREVENTING MORE VICTIMS THAT'S WHAT I HOPE. WE CAN ACCOMPLISH BY USING THIS DATA BECAUSE STATUS WHAT'S MOST POWERFUL AND I THINK THAT'S OUR DUTY. NINE THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY IN A NOTE THE LEGISLATURE'S PASS LEGISLATION PASSED TO FIRST ASCERTAIN HOW MANY. KIDS WENT UNTESTED. AND THEN THERE WAS LEGISLATION LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR VETOED AND OTHERS CURRENT LEGISLATION -- PLEA BY WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY SENATOR DRAWS A BUT BY SENATOR LEYVA. OVER THE SENATE SB TWENTY TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES AS WELL BUT WE WILL DEFINITELY AS A COMMITTEE START LOOKING INTO. HOW THE REST OF TESTIMONY GOES WITH THE REST OF THE PANELS? A LOOK AT POSSIBLE LEGISLATION THE CASE HOW COME INFORMATION. AND PROP SO WE COULD MOVE FORWARD IN THAT DIRECTION. BUT WITH THAT -- LET ME ASK THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS -- HEARING AND SEEING THAT AND LET'S GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO OUR SECOND PANEL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. REMOVED OUR SECOND PANEL. IT'S COMMENTS AND RESPONSES ON THE AUDIT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH US TODAY WE HAVE VERY MILLER DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- CHRIS RYAN CHIEF DIVISION OF OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE NANCY O'MALLEY DISTRICT ATTORNEY. FOR THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE MORGAN GEYER SUPERVISING -- DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THANK YOU GUYS FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. AND PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN SALAS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS VERY MILLER AND ON BEHALF OF ATTORNEY GENERAL THE SERRA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS COMMITTEE TODAY -- AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES. I'M HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE EFFORTS THE DEPARTMENT IS MADE TO STREAMLINE THE ANALYSIS AND COMBINED DNA INDEX SYSTEM HIT NOTIFICATION PROCESS. AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT'S RAPID DNA SERVICE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE RATS PROGRAM WHICH YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT. THE TWENTY FOURTEEN AUDIT AND THE TWENTY NINETEEN FOLLOW UP ON A REPORTS RELATED TO SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE. AS MOST OF YOUR LIKELY AWARE IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION SIXTY NINE WHICH EXPANDED MODIFIED PREVIOUS LEGISLATION -- PERTAINING TO THE CAL DNA DATA BANK AND AS A RESULT SEARCHES MADE AGAINST THAT RAPIDLY GROWING DATABASE BEGAN TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DNA COLD HITS. AND A COLD IT OCCURS WHEN THE CODE A SEARCH OF AN EVIDENCE PROFILE FROM A CASE WITHOUT A SUSPECT RESULTS IN A MATCH TO AN OFFENDER WHOSE IN THE DATABASE. CODICE IS THE F. B. I.'S DNA DATABASE THAT INCLUDES LOCAL STATE AND NATIONAL INDEXES AND IS USED WHEN AN UNKNOWN DNA PROFILES OBTAINED FROM EVIDENCE. BASED ON THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF COLD HITS AND THE NECESSITY FOR US TO PROVIDE A REPORT FOR EVERY HIT TO THE INVESTIGATING AGENCY. A DATABASE WAS DEVELOPED TO AID IN THE REPORTING OF HITS AND FOLLOW THE PROGRESS OF THE FENDER HITS IN CASE TO CASE MATCHES. THIS DATABASE PROJECT WAS ENTITLED THE COLD HIT OUTCOME PROJECT OR CHOP AND WAS DEPLOYED SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH. TWO THOUSAND NINE CHOP WAS INITIALLY PROVIDED TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF AGENCIES AND BY JULY TWENTY TEN WAS DEPLOYED IN TEN COUNTIES WITH APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SUBSCRIBERS. TODAY CHOP NOW KNOWN AS THE CODIS HIT OUTCOME PROJECT IS USED IN SOME CAPACITY BY ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. AND HAS APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN HUNDRED USERS. CHAVEZ SEVERAL BENEFITS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED BY DOJ AT NO COST TO LOCAL AGENCIES. IT MAKES THE HIT NOTIFICATION DOCUMENT THAT WE PROVIDE TO THOSE AGENCIES A PORTABLE DOCUMENT FORMAT PDF THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN GO IN AND GET. IT SENDS AUTOMATED EMAIL ALERTS WHEN THEIR HITS BETWEEN OFFENDER HIT PROFILES IN FRANCE A GUN ON RECORDS. IT SENDS AUTOMATED EMAIL ALERTS OF CASE TO CASE HITS WHEN A DNA MATCH OCCURS BETWEEN EVIDENCE PROFILES FROM DIFFERENT CASES. IT SERVES AS AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR TRACKING THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA FORENSIC DNA RECORDS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO CODICE. IT SENDS AUTOMATED EMAIL ALERTS ON ESTABLISHMENTS MARK ANNIVERSARIES THREE SIX TEN YEARS TO ASSIST DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES WITH FILING A JOHN DOE WARRANTS. IN IT ALSO SERVES AS THE BASIS FOR TO STATISTICS AND REPORTING FOR PARTICIPATING AGENCIES. THESE UPDATES TO CHOP ALLOW FOR MORE EFFICIENT NOTIFICATION PROCESS AND IMPROVE CODIS HIT -- TRACKING AND COMMUNICATION. THE RAPID DNA SERVICE STARTED AS A PILOT PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TO BETTER SERVE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. IN AN ATTEMPT TO ENSURE TIMELY IN A PARTIAL PROCESSING OF SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES THE RATS PROGRAM WAS CREATED TO RAPIDLY RECEIVE AN ANALYZE THE MOST PROBATIVE SAMPLES IN SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES. IT WAS A NOVEL APPROACH AS IT ALLOWED THE MEDICAL STAFF TO SUBMIT THE EVIDENCE DIRECTLY TO THE LABORATORY WITHOUT FIRST PASSING THROUGH THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE APPROACH NOT ONLY LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN THE EFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE PROCESSING BUT ALSO DEMONSTRATED -- RELATIVELY THE SAME WHAT WE WOULD CALL HIT RATE. AS A TRADITIONAL SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE ANALYSIS FULL KIT ANALYSIS SO WE SAW GOOD STATISTICS EITHER WAY. TO TRY TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE BACKLOG PROBLEM THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR PERFORMED AN AUDIT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT PRIOR TO US COMING UP HERE -- ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WAS THAT DOJ REQUIRE ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE RED SERVICE AREAS WHICH WERE SEVEN COUNTIES AT THE TIME PLUS -- ON A LIMITED TERM ALAMEDA COUNTY -- AS PART OF OUR PROCESS TO HELP THEM GET STARTED AS WELL TO ENTER AN UPDATE INFORMATION INTO CHOPS THAT OUTCOME INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR BETTER CONVERSATION STATISTICS AND DECISION MAKING. AND AT THE TIME BFS AGREED TO MODIFY THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAD DEVELOPED FOR THESE COUNTIES TO CLEARLY OUTLINE THE EXPECTATION THAT PARTICIPANTS USE AN UPDATE CHOP. SOME OF THE USER MODIFIED WITH THE CORRECT LANGUAGE NOT ALL WERE MODIFIED DUE TO THE RAPID EXPANSION THAT OCCURRED BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE PROGRAM EXPANDED TO THIRTY NINE COUNTIES. OUT OF THE FORTY SIX COUNTIES THAT WE SERVE. CALIFORNIA COUNTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE THEIR OWN -- SORRY THAT DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN LABS THOSE ARE THE AREAS WE SERVE THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN LAPS. SEVERAL USE WERE NOT CREATED OR SIGN FOR NEW COUNTIES ENTERED THE PROGRAM -- WELL SOME OF THIS MAY HAVE BEEN IMPROVED OF BETTER RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY OUT REACHING COMMUNICATION FOR THIS NON MANDATED PROGRAM IT IS APPARENT THAT WITHOUT A CLEAR LEGISLATIVE MANDATE IN PLACE. BFS WILL BE VERY POORLY POSITION TO GET A 100% OF THE AMMO YOU SIGNED TO PROPERLY ENFORCE. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS SINCE THE FIRST CALIFORNIA STATE ON A REPORT WAS ISSUED. BFS IS EXPERIENCED SOME VERY CRITICAL DEFINITE DEFICITS IN OUR PRIMARY REVENUE FUND AND THAT'S THE THE ANY ID FUND THE FUND DECREASED BY 12%. BETWEEN. FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND IT WAS DOWN 27% BY THE END OF FISCAL YEAR. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AS A RESULT OF YOUR WAS ALSO FORCED TO RELEASE A NUMBER OF VACANCIES THAT WE COULDN'T SUSTAIN. THE VARIOUS REVIEWS OF THE PROGRAM WERE CONDUCTED BY PREVIOUS MANAGEMENT PRIOR TO THE FOLLOW UP OUT OF THERE WAS A HIGH TURNOVER OF STAFF AND LEADERSHIP. AND WHILE THE SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS AND REPORTING SIDE OF THIS PROGRAM IS STILL VERY SUCCESSFUL. THE NON MANDATED CHOP OUTCOME REPORTING WAS UNDENIABLY NEED IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING A LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENT TO REPORT OUTCOMES IN CHOP. INITIAL OUT REACH. FOR THE RATS PROGRAM WAS VERY ACTIVE AS WE WERE ONLY DEALING WITH THOSE FEW INITIAL COUNTIES. BUT THE PROGRAM AS I STATED BEFORE GREW RAPIDLY WITH THAT ADDITIONAL THIRTY TWO COUNTIES BRINGING OUR TOTAL THIRTY NINE BETWEEN. TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THE WORKLOAD FOR MODIFYING MAINTAINING AND GATHERING SIGNATURES FOR AND WILL USE DID NOT KEEP UP AT THE SAME PACE. THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT BY THE LEGISLATURE TO MANDATE SHOP SB TEN SEVENTY NINE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN BUT IT WAS HELD IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS. ABSENT LEGISLATION MANDATING THE USE OF CHOP AND RESOURCES FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO PERFORM THE TYPE ABOUT REACHED THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR REPORT SUGGESTS. THE ABILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO DIVERT FUNDS FROM OTHER CRITICAL NEEDS AND MANDATE SUCH A SAFETY THE CAL DNA DATA BANK AT CETERA WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND AS A RESULT BE INSUFFICIENT. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S OFFICE HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ONE TIME SOLUTIONS TO FILL GAPS IN FUNDING OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS? THESE SOLUTIONS ONLY ADDRESS CURRENT WORKLOADS ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS AS THE D. ANY ID FUND CONTINUES TO REMAIN VOLATILE AND THERE'S LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPANSIVENESS IS WITHOUT A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION AN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED THE D. ANY ID FUND HAS DECREASED BY 27% BETWEEN FISCAL YEARS FOURTEEN FIFTEEN TO NOW. AND THAT DECREASE EQUATED TO MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET RELEASED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S OFFICE. I CAN TALK FOR A SECOND ABOUT SAFETY -- THE SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EVIDENCE TRACKING DATABASE IN RESPONSE TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S AUDIT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE BEER FRANTIC SERVICES CREATED A DATABASE FOR TRACKING SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KIT STATEWIDE. AS THE SCOPE AS WE'VE HEARD OF THE SEXUAL SOCKET INVENTORY. AND WHEN I SAY INVENTORY THOSE THINGS THAT ARE SITTING AT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WAS UNKNOWN. THIS WOULD PROVIDE A PERSPECTIVE EVALUATION OF ALL KIDS IN CALIFORNIA FOR TRACKING STATUS REPORTING. SAFETY WAS CREATED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR THAT PURPOSE SAFETY DOES NOT TRACK ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. AND ASSEMBLY BILL AB EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT WAS INTRODUCED TO MANDATE THE ENTRY INTO SAFETY BUT WAS ALSO HELD THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS HOWEVER AN ADDITIONAL EFFORT. TO MANDATE SAFETY AB FORTY ONE WAS INTRODUCED IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SESSION. THE BILL PASSED THE MANDATED THE TRACKING OF SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KIDS WITHIN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OF COLLECTION. AND THAT MANDATE BEGAN JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH OUR FIRST REPORT DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE SOMETIME THIS YEAR -- ON THE DATABASE ITSELF -- BOY THAT'S JULY OF THIS YEAR. WITH THAT JULY TWENTY NINETEEN THERE THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC DATE FOR WHEN WE HAD -- TO PROVIDE IT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CATCH UP WITH LAGS SINCE THERE IS A ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY PERIOD [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANKS. TO SO THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR INITIATE IS FOLLOW UP ON IT AROUND THE RECOMMENDATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REPORT CASE CHOP OUTCOME INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE AUDIT REVIEW THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS. WHICH MAY CONTAIN DNA EVIDENCE THAT CAN ASSIST IN THE INVESTIGATION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL VALUE IN RELATING THOSE OUTCOMES TO DNA HITS IN THE COMBINED DNA INDEX SYSTEM. THE NEW REPORT FOCUSES EXCLUSIVELY ON THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND FOLLOW THE TWENTY FOURTEEN CSA RECOMMENDATIONS. WHICH IT FINDS MADE INSUFFICIENT EFFORTS TO OBTAIN CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION. THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT REVEALED SOBRE SEVERAL AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT'S RATS PROGRAM. MAINLY RELATED AROUND THE AMMO USE AND DISCUSSED OUR UNIQUE POSITION FOR REPORTING CASE OUTCOME INFORMATION RELATED TO HIT NOTIFICATIONS. I WON'T LIST ALL THE SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT THE FLAG IS PRESUMABLY YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU -- INSTEAD I JUST WANT TO VERY QUICKLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE pAPPROPRIATE AND DISCUSS OUR PLANS MOVING FORWARD. HISTORICALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S ROLE IN THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE CASE IS VERY LIMITED ONCE THE DNA. WANTS DNA HAS BEEN PROCESSED THROUGH THE RATS PROGRAM WE ENTER THAT INFORMATION INTO CHOPPER HIT NOTIFICATION. THERE AFTER AN AUTOMATED EMAIL SENT TO THE INVESTIGATING AGENCY AND IT'S AN INCUMBENT UPON THEM TO GO IN THERE AND RETRIEVE THAT DNA HIT. SO THERE'S SINCE THERE'S NO STATUTORY REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO USE AND ENTERED IT INTO CHOP DOJ'S ABILITY TO ENSURE PARTICIPATION BY THE LOCAL AGENCIES IS LIMIT. IN OUR ENFORCEMENT. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH AB FIFTEEN SEVENTEEN ESTABLISHED THE NEED FOR RAPID TURNAROUND -- DNA PROGRAM AND REQUIRED THE USE OF A WRITTEN AGREEMENT WHICH WE USED AS A DEMO YOU. BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT THE CRIME LABORATORY AND THE MEDICAL FACILITY WHERE THE SEXUAL ASSAULT TEAM IS BASED. PURSUANT TO THE AUDIT WAS SUGGESTED THAT WE CHANGE THE LANGUAGE IN THE M. O. U. REQUIRING CHOP PARTICIPATION FOR AGENCIES USING THE RATS PROGRAM UNFORTUNATELY. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DOESN'T HAVE AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IF SOMEBODY VIOLATES AN AMMO YOU. WE CAN ASK AGAIN BUT WE CAN'T ENFORCE THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING. SEC DOING THINGS LIKE NOT PROCESSING PROCESSING THEIR CASES IN ENFORCEMENT IS NOT REALLY SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO DO BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T HELP VICTIMS IT DOESN'T HELP THE PUBLIC AND SO WE CONTINUE TO TAKE THEIR CASES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE ENTERING. THE CASE SAID OUTCOME INFORMATION. AND AS A RESULT SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN WE HAVE REPORTED TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT OBTAINING CASE OUTCOMES IS AN UP HILL BATTLE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF A STATUTORY MANDATE TO COLLECT THEM. AND WE'VE SEEN WERE STATUTORILY MANDATED ENTRY INTO A DATABASE USING SAFETY AS A PROXY. IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN COMPLIANCE AFTER ONLY ONE YEAR WE ARE SEEING A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF COMPLIANCE FOR THE CASES THAT ARE ENTERED INTO SAFETY WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY MANDATE. SO I'LL CONCLUDE -- WE AGREE WITH THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS THAT A STATUTORY MANDATE TO REQUIRE ENTRY OF CASE. CASE OUTCOME DATA INTO CHOP IS NEEDED AS TO THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS. DOJ IS COMMITTED TO DOING EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR LIMITED RESOURCES TO ENSURE THE INFORMATION REPORTS OBTAINED. ARE OBTAINED FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND TO THAT END WERE ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF DRAFTING A WHAT WE CALL PHYSICAL EVIDENCE BILL AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE PUT OUT PUBLICLY TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IS TO OUR EXPECTATIONS OF THEM. FOR US ANALYZING THEIR EVIDENCE. WHERE DRAFTING INFORMATION BILL AND FOR ALL THOSE CLAN AGENCIES THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE -- IN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT NETWORK. AS WELL AS REVIEWING THE FEASIBILITY OF GENERATING A GATHERING SIGNATURES ON AND WILL USE FROM EVERY PARTICIPATING AGENCY IN THE THIRTY NINE RATS COUNTIES. THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT EFFORT BECAUSE COUNTIES OBVIOUSLY HAVE MULTIPLE SIGNATORIES A DISTRICT ATTORNEY A SHARE OF MULTIPLE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS. BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MUNICIPAL HEADS -- ALL OF THOSE HAVE TO BE LOOKED DOWN INTO. AND WE'RE WORKING TO ENSURE THAT OUR TRAINING INCLUDES MODULES ON SHOP IN OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR ENTRY BEYOND THESE EFFORTS WE WELCOME THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF AND RESOURCES THAT WILL HELP ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF RATS AND CHOP -- EFFORTS THAT WE KNOW WILL ULTIMATELY HELP VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S CUT AND MOVE ON WILL TAKE ALL TESTIMONY AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU I'M NANCY O'MALLEY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF ALAMEDA COUNTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS HEARING AND FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE PART OF IT. I WANT TO SHARE THAT WHEN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE I WAS A RAPE CRISIS VOLUNTEER. I WAS ONE OF THE VOLUNTEERS WHO WAS ON WAS WITH A VICTIM OF THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER. AND SO I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THIS AREA SINCE THAT TIME AND IS ONE OF THE REASONS I BECAME A PROSECUTOR WAS TO CHANGE THE INJUSTICES THAT WERE OCCURRING. TO VICTIMS OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT. IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN I HAD A CALL FROM SOMEONE FROM SANTA CRUZ WHO HAD A INDICATED THAT HER KID HAD BEEN. SITTING ON A SHELF IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SHERIFF DEPARTMENT FOR SEVEN MONTHS AND HOW RATE JUST THAT WAS. THAT PROMPTED ME TO START A PROJECT IN MY OWN COUNTY. BUT BEFORE I STARTED THE PROJECT IN MY COUNTY WENT TO NEW YORK CITY TO SEE WHAT THEY DID BECAUSE THEY HAD TEN THOUSAND UNTESTED KIDS. AND THEY WERE MANAGING HOW THEY WERE GOING TO TEST THOSE KIDS. IN ADDITION TO TRYING TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WOULD BEEN KILLED IN NINE ELEVEN THE NINE ELEVEN ATTACK SO THAT A LOT OF WORK THEY WERE DOING AND YET THEY WERE MANAGING. TO ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG AND KEEP UP WITH THEIR CURRENT WORK. SO I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT THEY WERE DOING THAT WAS RIGHT. AND I CAME BACK AND I CAST TO PROSECUTORS IN MY OFFICE TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT I DO BELIEVE THE PROSECUTORS THE DA THE ELECTED DA HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE. IN THEIR COUNTIES EACH OF OUR COUNTIES TO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTICULARLY IN MANY OF THE COUNTIES WHERE THERE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IS REALLY THE SHERIFF'SDEPARTMENT. BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THEIR COUNTY SO I DO THINK THAT THE DA HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY. AND THE TWO STAFF MY TWO ATTORNEYS WORKED WITH EVERYONE OF OUR POLICE AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY HOW MANY UNTESTED KIDS THEY HAD IN THEIR PROPERTY ROOM. IT TOOK US ABOUT A YEAR AND I WILL SAY THAT THE CITY OF OAKLAND WHO WAS PART OF THE ORIGINAL AUDIT. WAS THE MOST -- RESISTANT TO OUR EFFORTS AND EVENTUALLY IT BECAME MORE A POLITICAL ISSUE. WHERE THE MAYOR GOT INVOLVED THE CITY MANAGER GOT INVOLVED AND THEY ORDERED THE CRIME LAB DIRECTOR TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR PROGRAM? WHICH THEY EVENTUALLY DID AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED WAS A HAD ALMOST NINE HUNDRED UNTESTED KIDS. AND THEIR CRIME LAB IS IN THE SAME BUILDING AS OUR EVIDENCE ROOM. SO FOR ME -- YOU KNOW I CONTAIN MY OUTRAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MOVED FORWARD AND WORK COLLABORATIVELY -- AND WE STARTED THE EFFORT. TO START IDENTIFYING THIS KITCHEN FIGURE AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF IT. I FOUND MONEY THROUGH -- FOR FUTURE UNRESTRICTED FOR FUTURE DOLLARS AND I PAID FOR THE FIRST ROUND OF TESING WE DID NOT GO THROUGH OUR GOVERNMENT CRIME LAB. THEY WERE FRANKLY TOO SLOW. AND THEY WOULD TAKE SIX MONTHS AND THEY WERE CHARGING LAW ENFORCEMENT. MORE MONEY THAN MANY OF THE AGENCIES HAD. SO WE GOT IN TOUCH WITH THE COMPANY WE MET HIM THROUGH NATASHA YOU'RE GONNA MEET IN A FEW MINUTES. TO THE NATASHA PROJECT BODHI LAB IN VIRGINIA AND WE CONTRACT WITH THEM AND THEY DID THEY HAVE DONE ALL OF OUR BACKLOG TESTING. THE FIRST GROUP WE SENT THEM ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN KIDS. AND IN ONE MONTH'S TIME THEY HAD COMPLETED THEIR REVIEW OF THOSE HUNDRED SIXTEEN THE TESTING WE HAD FIFTY ONE PROFILES IDENTIFIED AND ADDED THAT IN THE FIRST WEEKEND THAT IT WAS IN CODIS. WHICH ALSO FEEDS INTO THE BIG STATE DOT DOJ -- DATABASE FEEDS INTO THE NATIONAL IN THAT FIRST WEEK IN MAY TWENTY SEVEN HITS ON THE FIFTY ONE PROFILES THAT WE SUBMITTED. SO WE KNOW THE SIGNIFICANCE THAT DISPLAYS IN BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY PERPETRATORS. TO IDENTIFY SERIAL RAPIST AND MARK AS IMPORTANTLY WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER POINTED OUT TO EXONERATE PEOPLE WHO WERE IDENTIFIED BY. THE THROUGH THE EYE WITNESS TESTIMONY WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE FLOOD. OR PEOPLE THAT WERE CHARGED THAT HAD NOT ACTUALLY COMMITTED THE CRIME. SINCE THAT TIME -- WE WE CREATED AN ENTIRE -- INITIATIVE CALLED ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG. WE SHARE THIS AROUND THE STATE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND IT HAD SEVERAL COMPONENTS NOT JUST ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THESE TO THESE KIDS TESTED IN A TIMELY MANNER. BUT ONE OF THE OTHER BACKLOGS THAT EXIST IS THAT WHEN A PRIVATE LAB -- WHICH FOR US WAS BODHI WHICH WAS PROCESSING A HUNDRED KIDS A MONTH FOR US -- THAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH THAT BEFORE THE DNA PROFILE COULD GO INTO THE DATABASE. SOMEONE FROM A GOVERNMENT CRIME LET WOULD HAVE TO REVIEW THE REPORT. NOW I KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS AND I READ A LOT OF THESE REPORTS AND THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME REPORT WITH THE BOTTOM LINE BEING DIFFERENT WHICH WHOEVER THE PROFILE IS. BUT IN THE HOUSTON WHEN I WENT AND VISITED THEIR LAB IT WAS TAKING THEM THREE YEARS JUST TO REVIEW THE REPORTS. SO THERE WAS NOT ONLY A BACKLOG OF KIDS NOT BEINGTESTED BUT THEN THREE YEARS TO GET THROUGH ALL THE REPORTS. AND WE WE HAVE RECEIVED SPECIAL FUNDING WE DID RECEIVE. A SPECIAL FUNDING TO PAY FOR SOMEONE IN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW OUR REPORT WE NOW HAVE NO BACKLOG AND WE ALSO IN ADDITION TO HAVING NO BACKLOG WE ALSO SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE EACH OF US -- ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS WE KNOW EVERY EXAM THAT'S DONE I GET A REPORT EVERY MONTH. I KNOW HOW MANY KIDS ARE HOW MANY REPORTS. OF SEXUAL SORRY PORTS ARE MADE TO EACH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY I KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HAS REQUESTED OR OTHERS AUTHORIZED THE KID TO BE DONE OR AN EXAM. WE KNOW WHETHER OR NOT IT'S BEEN SUBMITTED AND SO I CAN KEEP TRACK OF THAT IN THE DATA KEEPS PEOPLE KEEP ALL OF US ACCOUNTABLE. BUT I DIDN'T SHOULD STOP THERE. BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS I DID WAS I WENT TO WASHINGTON DC AND AS A RESULT OF THE WORK THAT WE DID IN WASHINGTON WHITE A MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE. EXPLAIN THE BACKLOG IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROPERTY ROOMS. WE DID A DIAGRAM FOR THEM AND THEY UNDERSTOOD AND PRESENT A MAMA PUT MONEY IN HIS BUDGET FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS OUR NATION. THAT IS CONTINUED AND NOW THERE'S OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DOJ HAS BEEN THE RECIPIENT OF SOME OF THAT MONEY. I KNOW AND MY AND IT IS STILL IN THE IN THE NEW THE UPCOMING BUDGET FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR OF NINETEEN TWENTY FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ANOTHER FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THE THE PART SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PUT THEIR RESOURCES. INTO A LOT OF RESOURCES FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT ONLY TO TEST KITS BUT TO SET UP PROCEDURES. LIKE MINE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WHERE THERE IS NEVER GOING TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BACK LOVE TO HER AGAIN. OF THE SAFETY DATABASE -- THAT WAS JUST TALK ABOUT IT WAS OF LEGISLATION THAT I SPONSORED AND I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE THE PROPERTY ROOMS LOGGING IN I MEAN ONE OF THE BIGGEST PITFALLS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH PROPERTY. AND EVIDENCE SO IT'S LOGGED IN ITS VERY CAREFULLY MONITORED. IT'S JUST A FEW MORE KEYSTROKES TO LOG INTO THE SAFETY DATABASE AND THAT WE WERE ALWAYS GOING TO KNOW WITH THE CLICK OF A A QUERY TO FIND OUT HOW MANY KIDS ARE IN THE CRIME LAB. I DO BELIEVE THAT -- THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT THE TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING SO FAST THAT I BELIEVE THAT SOME OF OUR CRIME LABS HAVE NOT KEPT UP DOJ IS ACTUALLY OUR MODEL. FOR TESTING EQUIPMENT TO LET OTHERS ARE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THE CRIME LABS KNOW THAT THIS IS EQUIPMENT THAT WILL HELP BE MORE EFFICIENT. REQUIRES FEWER CRIMINALISTS I MEAN THERE HAS TO BE CRIMINALISED BUT A LOT OF IT IS DONE BEING DONE. BY TECHNICIANS WERE ASSISTING THE CRIMINALIST TO GO THROUGH THE TECHNOLOGY THROUGH ROBOTICS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT. I AND THAT'S THOSE ARE WAYS THAT FOR ALL OF THE THE NUMBER OF SEXUAL SOLVE CRIMES WHICH IS STAGGERING. STILL -- THAT THAT IS OUR ABILITY TO TAP INTO THE TECHNOLOGY. THAT OCCURRED IN OF THIS ALL STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN. BILL LOCKYER WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO PUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS INTO CREATING THE INFRASTRUCTURES OF DNA. OF LABS TO DO DNA WORK AND WE'RE STILL HERE AND WE STILL HAVE KIDS THAT ARE UNTESTED. SO -- THIS IS AN EFFORT THAT I AM SO THANKFUL THAT THE THE AUDITS THAT WERE DONE TO GIVE FOCUS TO THIS I DO I AM SPONSORING NOW THE LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO SUBMIT ALL KIDS TO BE TESTED AND WE LAST YEAR WE GOT TO THE LEGISLATURE WITHOUT ANY NO VOTES BUT THE GOVERNOR VETOED IT. AT THE LAST MINUTE THIS YEAR WE HOPE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND CHANGE THAT PARADIGM -- AND THEN JUST ONE MORE THING TO JUST REITERATE IS THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S IN EACH COUNTY SHOULD STEP UP. AND EXERCISE OUR LEADERSHIP THERE THE CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN THE COUNTIES AND THEY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERYONE OF THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GET THINGS DONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS. PLEASE LET'S CONTINUE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MORGAN GEYER AND I'M A SUPERVISING DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY DA'S OFFICE. DOCTOR REPRESENT BEHIND ME I'M GOING TO APOLOGIZE READING MY BACK DOOR. I WILL ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY O'MALLEY AND BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE SACRAMENTO PROCESS AS WELL -- FIRST I SUPERVISE OUR JUSTICE TRAINING INTEGRITY DIVISION OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHICH COVERS -- I OVERSEE OUR CONVICTION REVIEW PROGRAM AND OUR REQUESTS FOR POST CONVICTION DNA TESTING -- NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO WE BEGAN. THE INNOVATIVE PROCESS OF HAVING THE SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS. SUBMITTED DIRECTLY TO OUR CRIME LAB SACRAMENTO COUNTY HAS ITS OWN. LABORATORY FORENSIC SERVICES THAT IS RUN THROUGH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND THOSE KIDS FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED DIRECTLY. TO THE CRIME LAB -- IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE BEGAN THE POLICY OF TESTING EVERY KID THAT WE HAD REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAD BEEN A REQUEST FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT -- JUST PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE WE RECEIVE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEXUAL SOCKETS PER YEAR -- SO WE BEGAN THE PROCESS OF GOING BACK THROUGH THE ONES THAT HAD BEEN DECIDED NOT TO BE TESTED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY KID WAS TESTED. CURRENTLY AS IT STANDS TODAY -- WE ARE CURRENT BACK THROUGH TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND FROM TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT PRIOR SO WE HAVE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WITH SOME REMAINING KITS. THE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE KIDS HAVE ALL BEEN ASSIGNED TO OUR ANALYSTS AND HAVE BEEN INTEGRATED INTO THEIR CASELOADS. AND WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO KITS REMAINING FROM TWO THOUSAND TEN IT'LL BE COMPLETED WELL BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR -- AND THAT WILL KEEP US CURRENT IT IT TAKES US ROUGHLY -- WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS TO TOUCH TEST EACH SEXUAL ASSAULT KIT -- IT. OUR PROCESS OF OF DIRECTLY RECEIVING THOSE KIDS INTO OUR CRIME LAB REMOVE SOME OF THE CONCERNS WERE ADDRESSED BY THE AUTHOR ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES WHY KIDS ARE TESTED. UP OCCASIONALLY THE EXCEPTIONS WOULD BE IF THERE'S IF IT'S DETERMINED THAT NO CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED WHATSOEVER ON THOSE SORT OF OR ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. BUT EVEN IF THERE'S NO REQUEST FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. OUR COUNTY TEST THOSE KITS REGARDLESS. AND I DON'T THINK IT'S MUCH IN DISPUTE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED FROM THOSE CATS -- AS MR O'MALLEY MENTIONED EARLIER -- ONE NOT NEED LOOK FARTHER THAN THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER EAST AREA RAPIST CASE AS AN EXAMPLE. ON THE CASE HAD GONE FOR COLD FOR FORTY YEARS THERE WERE THIRTEEN MURDERS AND OUR FIFTY SEXUAL ASSAULT AND BURGLARIES COMMITTED -- BY A MAN WHO TERRORIZED OUR STATE AND IT WAS DNA THAT KEPT THAT CASE FROM BEING UNSOLVED ARE THERE ARE. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY JUST THIS ONE CASE BUT ULTIMATELY WAS SOLVED THROUGH THIS VERY IMPORTANT -- PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WERE WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AND I WOULD ECHO DR WEBER'S COMMENTS AND RETURNING O'MALLEY'S COMMENTS IN THAT. IT'S HELPFUL TO SOLVE OUR CASES IT'S VERY HELPFUL TO PROVIDE EXONERATIONS AND REMOVE THE CLOUD OF SUSPICION. WHEN YOU JUST THINKING CONTEXT OF THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER CASE HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL SUSPECTS -- JUST GIVEN THE NUMBER OF CRIMES THAT WERE COMMITTED AND TO BE ABLE TO USE OF THESE. USE THE PROFILE WITH THAT ARE DEVELOPING THESE KIDS TO BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE THE CLOUD OF SUSPICION IS IS INVALUABLE -- SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE HAVE. LONG BEEN IN SUPPORT OF TESTING EVERY KID THAT COMES IN -- I AND I THINK THAT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DO IT ON I WOULD ECHO THE OTHER COMMENTS OF JUST RETURNING O'MALLEY AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR DISCUSS FURTHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THINK FOR TESTIMONY. WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY SENATOR BILL SENT CENTER THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AS WELL. YEAH THE ROADS WERE IN THE FINANCE COMMITTEE. YES AS I EARNED. AND SIR BORDERS ALSO JOINED US BUT I THINK HE HAD RUN TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE -- TO VOTE OR PRESENT ON A BILL. SO IT'S IS A SEASON -- THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY -- GIVE US A VALLEY AND MISTER GUY YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT. THE BACKLOG I THINK IT WAS WAS SOME ELEY SUBJECT NINETEEN HUNDRED AT ONE TIME BUT YOU'VE WORKED THROUGH THAT SYSTEMATICALLY -- WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GET MY ARMS AROUND. WHAT YOU GUYS SAID WHY WE DON'T SEE THAT IN EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY? UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE AND DOJ'S. SEEN SOME OF THIS INFORMATION BUT YOU TALKED ABOUT FEDERAL FUNDING IN GOING TO DC IN GETTING FEDERAL REALLY JUST A RESOURCE QUESTION OR IS THIS. I MEAN WHAT ELSE IS LACKING OR WHAT I TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. AT THROUGH STATURE DO WE DO HERE AT THE STATE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE HAD LEGISLATION PREVIOUSLY YOU HELP SPONSOR SOME LEGISLATION AS WELL WE HAVE CURRENT -- LEGISLATION IN THE SENATE SENATE BILL TWENTY TWO RIGHT -- TRYING TO GET MY ARMS JUST AROUND THAT PIECE OF PERHAPS MISTER DYER MISS AMOUNT IF YOU CAN JUST ADDRESS THAT. IN A LOT OF THE RESEARCH THAT I DID WAS TALKING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. NOT JUST IN MY COUNTY BUT IN CALIFORNIA CROSS COUNTRY. AND FOR A LOT OF THE OFFICERS TO DO THE INVESTIGATION THEY WOULD PUT THE KID. IN THEIR EVIDENCE ROOM. AND THAT WOULD BE THE LAST TIME A POLICE OFFICER WOULD EVER TOUCH IT THE NEXT PERSON TO TOUCH IT WOULD BE A CRIME LAB ANALYST. AND SO THERE'S A DISK THERE HAS BEEN A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE OFFICERS. WHO ARE DOING THE A PRIMARY INVESTIGATION AND MAKING SURE THAT KID GETS TO THE CRIME LAB OR LIKE IN THE CASE OF OAKLAND? WHERE THEIR LAB IS IN THE SAME BUILDING AS THEIR PROPERTY ROOM? THAT SOMEBODY FROM THE LAB WOULD HAVE TO GO DOWN AND TAKE THAT PROPERTY OUT AND TAKE IT UP TO BE. A TO BE EXAMINED SO I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE CRIME LABS AND THE THE INVESTIGATING OFFICERS. THE SECOND PART IS. I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A MIS UNDERSTANDING OR A MYTH THAT IF SOMEBODY IDENTIFIES ARE NO SIR PERPETRATOR WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF SEXUAL SOLVE CRIMES ARE COMMITTED BY SOMEONE KNOWN. TO THE SURVIVOR. BUT WHAT WHAT GETS LOST IN THERE SO WHY WOULD YOU TEST THE DNA IF YOU ALREADY KNOW THE IDENTIFICATION. BUT WHAT WE FOUND IN TESTING KITS ACROSS AMERICA IS THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE SERIAL RAPIST. AND JUST YOU'LL -- IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE I AM EVIDENCE DONE BY MERCY HERE QUE YOU MAY HEAR ABOUT THAT IN THE NEXT PANEL. THAT REALLY REFLECTS HOW MANY SERIAL RAPISTS THEY WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY. BY EVEN THOUGH ONE OF THE THEY ROUTE ONE RATE THAT CAME TO THEIR ATTENTION. WAS -- COMMITTED AGAINST SOMEBODY KNOWN BY THE PERPETRATOR. SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY IS YOU KNOW THE OFFICERS LOOK AT ONE CASE AT A TIME. AND DNA HAS SHOWN IS THAT THERE ARE MANY CASES IN MY OWN COUNTY MY OWN COUNTY IN BERKELEY -- THERE WAS A SEXUAL SOLVE CRIME. SHE SUBMITTED TO AN EXAM AND NEVER GOT SUBMITTED FOR TESTING. THE SECOND SEXUAL ASSAULT CRIME HAPPENED AND THAT THAT VICTIM WAS MURDERED. THE THIRD SEXUAL SAW CRIME HAPPENED AND THE THAT WOMAN SUBMITTED TO TESTING. AND WHEN WE FINALLY WENT TO BERKELEY AND SAID GIVE US ALL YOUR KIDS -- THAT WE TESTED WE FOUND IT WAS THE SAME PERSON. AND THIS IS THE TOO MANY EXAMPLES OF THAT SO I DON'T I THINK THAT WE AGAIN THIS IS A PLACE WHERE I THINK THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY. I THINK THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AROUND. A TRAINING DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND PROSECUTORS WHO ARE REVIEWING CASES FOR WHETHER THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROSECUTE. BUT IMPORTANTLY I THINK THAT THERE HAS TO BE. MUCH MORE COORDINATION AN EMPHASIS ON SOMEONE HAS TO TAKE THE LEAD SO EVEN THOUGH THE THE CRIME THE PROPERTY ROOM. MANAGERS WILL ENTER INTO SAFETY. THAT IF THAT DOUBLE INFINITE KNOW WHATEVER CHECKS THAT DATABASE THEN IT'S JUST THERE SITTING THERE LIKE WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS. AND SO I DID I DO BELIEVE THAT THE I DON'T I THINK THE LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE ALL TEST KITS TO BE TESTED. IS REALLY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. I ALSO THINK THAT TAPPING INTO THE MODERN -- TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS TO ASSIST THE CRIME LABS TO BE MORE EFFICIENT IN THEIR TESTING. AND AND ACTUALLY AND I AND THIS ISSUE ABOUT. AN OUTSIDE LAB WHO ARE OFTEN TIMES. COST LESS MONEY THAN THE GOVERNMENT LABS DO. OUR FASTER AND YOU KNOW FRANKLY -- YOU KNOW IF THEY MAKE A MISTAKE THEY'RE OUT OF BUSINESS AND SO WE'VE SEEN -- WITH THE LAB THAT WE WORK WITH A LOT OF VERY GOOD -- ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT IF IT TAKES THREE YEARS TO REVIEW A REPORT REVIEW REPORTS THEN WE ARE NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEM. SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PILOT THAT WE'VE PITCH TO THE FBI. TO SEE IF WE CAN DO SOME WORK AROUND. REDUCING THE TIME THAT IT TAKES TWO TO REVIEW THOSE REPORT TO GET THESE PROFILES INTO THE NATIONAL DATABASE FASTER SO. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT. SO DO YOU HAVE. GIVE A POLICY NOW IT HAS ALL YOUR KIDS AND WE DO YOU DO. I THINK MR GEYER SAID YOU SAID YOU WHICH SAID IT DIRECTLY THOUGH RIGHT TO THE LAB THE WHEN THE WHEN THE FORENSIC MEDICAL EXAM IS COMPLETED AT OUR WHAT WE CALL OUR BEAR CENTER AT OUR AT OUR FORENSIC MEDICAL. CENTER THOSE KIDS ARE THEN. TAKEN DIRECTLY TO OUR CRIME LAB. SO IT NEVER GOES TO THAT NEVER GOES TO AN EVIDENCE LOCKER NEVER GOES LAW ENFORCEMENT FACILITY IT MAY BE TRANSPORTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT IT GOES DIRECTLY TO OUR LAB. AS SOON AS THE TESTING IS COMPLETED. SO ANY ANY ANY. UNTESTED KIDS OR RESULT OF OUR DECISION NOT TO HAVE DONE THAT FOR OUR DIVISION OF RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE NOW BEEN ABLE. TO ELIMINATE AND AN AD. TO THE CASE LOADS OF OUR ANALYSTS TO GET THOSE CASES DOWN AND I WOULD I WOULD ECHO WHAT. MS O'MALLEY SAID THAT IT IN OUR EXPERIENCE IT WAS SORT OF OUT OF SORT OF A PHILOSOPHY SHIFT AWAY FROM JUST SOLVING THE CASE THIS CASE WAS A CONSENT CASE THIS CASE WAS A SPOUSAL RAPE CASE AND AS AS DISTRICT ATTORNEY O'MALLEY POINTED OUT. WE'VE SPENT OUR CAREERS PROSECUTING SEX CRIME CASES AND AND IT AND IT'S TRUE THAT SOMEONE WHO. COMMITS A SPOUSAL RAPE WILL ALSO RAPE A STRANGER -- AND THAT THE OVERLAP OF THOSE CASES IS IS ON DOUBTED AND THE NEED FOR IT IS CRITICAL. CAN I JUST ADD THAT. IN SEVERAL OF THE A FEW OF THE COUNTIES WE DON'T USE THE DOJ LAB ANYMORE BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR OWN CRIME LET THE SHERIFF'S HAS ONE OAKLAND POLICE HAS AND HAS THEIR OWN. SAME THING IN LOS ANGELES LAPD HAS AROUND LA SHERIFF HAS HIS -- AND SO THERE ARE IN LA THERE'S AN ORDINANCE THAT THEY HAVE TO TEST THE KIDS AND THEY THEIR TIME LINE IS THE SAME AS THE LEGISLATION -- AND WHEN WE ARE CRAFTING THAT LEGISLATION WE'VE REACHED OUT TO THEM. BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF KIDS TWO OF FOR AN AGENCY. TO WHAT WOULD IT TAKE WHAT CAN THEY DO WHAT'S REALISTIC -- ORANGE COUNTY TESOL THEIR KIDS LA TESTS ALL THEIR KIDS SO THERE ARE INDEED AND NOW WILL COMPLETE OAKLAND POLICE ALSO TESTS ALL THEIR KIDS. SO THERE BEEN A LOT OF THOSE REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE THE BIGGER LABS THAT ARE CONNECTED TO A POLICE DEPARTMENT OR TO ACCOUNTING LIKE MINE. A WHERE THE KIDS ARE BEING ARE BEING TESTED. SO THE I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT A LOT OF COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY MOVING TOWARDS A MODEL BECAUSE OF THE CASE OUTCOMES IN THE IF IT'S RELATED YOU KNOW TO REPROACH HE BROUGHT UP THE NORTH CAROLINA. INCIDENT EARLIER IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL AND SO -- APPRECIATE THAT BUT RIGHT NOW YOU. FOR USMLE YOU DON'T -- SYNDICATE DIRECTLY TO BE TESTED YOU PUT IT IN EVIDENCE LOCKER I WAS WONDERING ABOUT BEST PRACTICES NOW. FOR FOR MOVING FORWARD IT MAYBE WE THAT WOULD PROBABLY STREAMLINED IT. SO SAN MATEO COUNTY GOES RIGHT FROM THEIR SEXUAL ASSAULT RESPONSE CENTER. WHERE THE EXAMS ARE DONE AND THIS THE KID DOESN'T GO BACK TO THE POLICE TO GOES DIRECTLY TO THEIR CRIME LAB -- AND THAT'S VERY EFFICIENT IN MY COUNTY WE HAVE TWENTY THREE PLEASE JURISDICTIONS. AND SUMMER OAKLAND LOGO THAT GOES DIRECTLY TO THEIR CRIME LAB OR TO THEIR EVIDENCE ROOM WHERE IT'S HELD SECURELY. AND THEY'RE WITHIN FIVE DAYS SOMEONE FROM THE CRIME LAB COMES AND GETS IT. AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. THAT IS. HELD IN A UP SOMEWHERE THAT SAVED. UP BUT WITH THE WITH THE REST OF THEM -- WE I DO THINK IT'S A GOOD IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY SEND IT DIRECTLY TO THE CRIME LAB -- AND I THINK THAT. THAT WAY -- IT HAS TO BE BOOKED IN. SOMEWHERE AND YOU KNOW I THINK YOU KNOW JUST WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND DIFFERENT MUNICIPALITIES THEY HAVE THEIR OWN POLICE AGENCY THERE. MAY BE A ISSUE AROUND THAT BUT EVERYTHING CAN BE DONE AND I AND IN OUR COUNTY WE'RE WE'RE REALLY MOVING MORE TOWARDS THAT. WITH THE NOT BRINGING IT TO THEIR EVIDENCE FROM NECESSARILY OR BOOKING IT AND THEN WITHIN THREE DAYS DELIVERING IT TO THE CRIME LAB. THANK YOU AND CENTER BELL HAS A QUESTION. OF JUST THE I'M ON THE BUDGET. SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE SO THAT'S MY WHY AM HERE ON THIS. HEARING -- WE'VE WE DISCUSSES QUITE A BIT LAST YEAR OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ACTUALLY. AND OF ALLOCATED MONEY AND AND SO FORTH. TO HELP EXPEDITE. OF THE BACKLOG AND BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE BOTH BOTH YOU I I WANTED TO FIND OUT -- WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE STATE BUDGET FOR THOSE OF? WE WE ALSO HAVE A REQUEST FOR A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. FOR ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT PROGRAMS FUNDING. TO DO MORE OF THE EDUCATION PREVENTION. KINDS OF PROGRAMS THAT COULD HELP. MAKE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHY THEY NEED TO HAVE. YOU KNOW RICHEST TESTING AND THE SO FOR US -- AND HOW TO OF COURSE AVOID SEXUAL SALTS OF AND DOES THE A BACKLOG NEED ADDITIONAL AS A BEEN A REQUEST FROM THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS. FOR THIS -- ISSUE -- AND YOU KNOW THE VARIOUS I WANT TO HEAR WHAT THEY'RE WHAT YOUR OPINION IS ON THAT. FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY PERSPECTIVE AND I ALSO I WANTED I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW COMING FROM SAN JOSE -- I KNOW THAT YOU YOU'RE JUST -- THE LEADER IN OUR STATE. FOR A DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE THAT YOU'VE GIVEN TO ALL OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. WELL -- I KNOW WAS SENATOR LAID HIS BILL WHICH I'M SPONSORING. A AND THAT WAS THE SAME WITH LAST YEAR WHERE THERE WAS MONEY ALLOCATED THAT YOU'RE LEGISLATURE DID A GAVE IN THE GOVERNOR -- CARRIED THROUGH. OF THERE IS A BUDGET REQUEST ALSO AND I THINK THAT DID. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS MODIFIED WHAT THE NEED IS I WANT. TO SO THE REQUEST THE BUDGET REQUEST I THINK NOW IS. WOULD BE FOR THE SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION WAS REALLY TO FOCUS ON BACKLOG. BUT THE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND EIGHT THINK IS TO CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD. WITH ALL KIDS BEING TESTED -- AND AND I THINK IT'S BEEN AND IF. EFFICIENT USE OF THE RESOURCES. TO HIRE THE CRIMINALISTS WHEN WE HAD THE DOWNTURN. IN THE ECONOMY SEVERAL YEARS BACK A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD TO LAY OFF A LOT OF STAFF AND THEY COULDN'T HIRE CRIMINALIST. AND I DON'T SPEAK FOR FOR THEM BUT I KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE BUSINESS. WELL WE WE OUT OF WE HAD IT BACK A LOT OF OF THE STAFF FOR THAT YES YES SO I DO THINK THAT'S THE CASE I ALSO THINK THAT. OF FOR THOSE LAB FOR THOSE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT DO NOT USE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE POLICY IS IF WE HAVE OUR OWN CRIME LAB WE CAN'T USE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. OTHER THAN VERY UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES BUT FOR THOSE POLICE AGENCIES. THERE MANY OF THE CRIME LABS ARE CHARGING THEM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS ABLE TO NOT CHARGE DOES COUNTY SAY SIR -- BUT FOR THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS LIKE LOS ANGELES AND OURS. AND IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY JUST WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD ONE BRAND BRAND NEW EXACTLY REALLY KNOW -- BUT THE POLICE BUT THE POLICE ARE PAYING. TO HAVE THE KIDS TESTED. AND BECAUSE IT'S A GOVERNMENT LAB THERE'S MORE -- INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT THAT'S NEEDED SO THAT THE COST IS HIGHER -- THAN SOME OF THESE OUTSIDE LABS AND SO THERE'S SOMEWHERE THAT I THINK WE COULD. GET RESOURCES TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO AT LEAST GET THEM GOING. I AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN REDUCE THE COST THE WAY SOME OF THE PRIVATE LABS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. I THINK WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL I'LL TALK TO CENTER SKINNER WHOSE IT'S THE COMMITTEES BASICALLY MYSELF CENTER CAN EARN SIR MORLOCK AND COURSE WE WORK WITH CENTER LEYVA. AS WELL. SO -- IS THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE DIRECTION MAKING A FORMAL PROPOSAL TO OUR COMMITTEE. THE FORMAL PROPOSAL FOR MONEY. AS WE DO WE DO MONEY. THAT ARE AVAILABLE AS A PROPOSAL REAL QUICK YOU HAVE A BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT SOME CLARIFICATION WE DO HAVE A BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR THE OKAY THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO THE BACK FILL I'M WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER ABOUT THE DNA FUND HAS BEEN STRUGGLING. AND IT WAS A PROPOSAL THAT WE BROUGHT TO THE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR -- SO THIS YEAR THE PROPOSAL IS TO EXTEND THAT FOR ONE MORE YEAR -- BUT WE ARE SEEKING A LONG TERM SOLUTION -- SO IN WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH THAT THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE HOPEFUL WE CAN GET TO A LONG TERM SOLUTION BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE A PROPOSAL THAT CARRIES OUT THE CURRENT SOLUTION ONE MORE YEAR. YEAH. YOU THINK THAT THE THE THE THERE'S ABOUT A DOZEN SENATORS ARE PROPOSING THE ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR THE PREVENTION EDUCATION. DO YOU THINK -- THAT WOULD -- HELP FACILITATE HOW WHAT IMPACT YOU THINK THAT WOULD HAVE WELL I THINK WHAT WHAT WE HAVE NOT GIVEN AS MUCH FOCUS TO IS AN IMMENSE ON OTHER THINGS -- AS I SAID -- MONEY OUT. ACTUALLY SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. IS ACTUALLY WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET FOR THAT RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE BUDGET THAT'S FANTASTIC -- I WELL IT'S BETTER THAN THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN ZERO YES SIR BUT AYE AYES SHARED EARLIER THAT I WAS A RAPE CRISIS VOLUNTEER IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AND AND IT WAS TERRIBLE. THEN FOR VICTIMS AND A AND SO IN AYE WE'RE ALSO GETTING READY FOR VICTIMS RIGHTS WEEK NEXT WEEK AND SO I'VE REVIEWED ALL OF THE LEGISLATURE A VICTIM SERVICES AND THE FIRST. VICTIMS RIGHTS LEGISLATION WAS FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE AND WE'RE STILL HERE. SO WE'RE I THINK THE FIFTY MILLION OR THE REQUEST -- FOR PREVENTION IN AND OUT REACH EDUCATION IS CRITICAL BECAUSE WHAT WE STILL SEE CONSISTENTLY IS THAT. ABOUT -- 5260% OF THE CASES ARE UNREPORTED. WHICH OF FOR A LOT OF REASONS AND AND SOME OF WHICH IS THAT -- PEOPLE JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SYSTEM IS ARE THEY DON'T WANT TO BECOME PUBLIC ABOUT IT AND WE'VE GOT THE LEGISLATURE'S CREATE A LOT OF LAWS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO REMAIN. ANONYMOUS IN THE SYSTEM SO I THINK THAT IF WE CAN INCREASE. THE NUMBER BECAUSE THROUGH EDUCATION AND THROUGH -- MORE -- INDIVIDUALIZED ENGAGEMENT WITH SURVIVORS THAT WE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER REPORT. I ALSO THINK THAT -- THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF EDUCATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TEEN DATING VIOLENCE IS ON A RISE. AND THERE'S A LOT OF OF ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON THAT THAT WE'RE TRYING. TO TO YOU KNOW GO LOWER AND LOWER IN THE AGE GROUP -- TO EDUCATE AND TO HELP TRY TO PREVENT [inaudible] THIS MORNING. SO IT WOULD GO FOR THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL AND YOU KNOW THE SAD ASIDE FROM THE DISTANT DISTRICT THAT HASN'T REALLY CHANGED VERY MUCH. SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHEN I FIRST BECAME INVOLVED ABOUT NOT REPORTING WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT ONLY ABOUT 5% OF CASES THAT ARE REPORTED. END UP IN A COURT ROOM. SO WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO IN WITH MY OWN PROFESSION ABOUT THAT AND WE'RE WE ARE EMBARKING ON THAT TO TRY TO EDUCATE PROSECUTORS ABOUT. THE PROVABILITY OF CASES AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT. VICTIMS TO HAVE THEIR JUSTICE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION CENTER VALLEY WE WOULD ASKING ABOUT -- THE BUDGET AND HOW TO HELP OUT -- I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF INTEREST FROM THE MEMBERS UP ON THE DíAS THAT WERE HERE EARLIER AS WELL ONE FIGURE OUT HOW WE TACKLE THIS PROBLEM. AND PAGE ONE OF THE **** CENTER LEYVA YEAH WE JUST PENSION SENATOR LAND AND HERE YOU ARE. A SELLER LABOR [inaudible] BUDGET. NASA'S ARRIVAL WE'RE JUST -- TALKING ABOUT YOUR LEGISLATION BUT ALSO -- THE BUDGET **** I WOULD GO WITH IT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TEST ALL. ALL THE KIDS WE'VE HAD TESTIMONY FOR ME TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES -- ABOUT THAT. AND BEST PRACTICES MAY BE YOU KNOW WHY WE GO TO EVIDENCE OR I KNOW I'VE READ SOME STORIES WERE. AT KIDS BEEN SITTING IN EVIDENCE FOR YEARS ALMOST YOU KNOW NINE TEN YEARS SOMETIMES -- IN MEANWHILE THERE'S OTHER VICTIMS DURING THAT TIME AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO TO DO THAT -- I WOULD DO APPRECIATE FORM OF JUSTICE TALKING ABOUT SPEAKING ABOUT AGREEING WITH THE AUDITS. AND THE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE OUTCOMES. RIGHT -- AND SO I WAS JUST WONDERING FROM DOJ'S POINT OF VIEW. WHAT MORE CAN WE DO TO HELP GET THOSE CASE OUTCOMES YOU HAD MENTIONED -- YOU KNOW YOU GUYS SENT OUT A BULLETIN. OF WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM EACH OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BUT SIR ANYTHING MORE THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF DOJ TRYING TO GET THIS CASE HOW COME INFORMATION THAT WE NEED OR IS THIS JUST HAS TO BE A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT WELL. UNTIL THERE'S A LEGISLATIVE MANDATEIT'S GOING TO BE A MATTER OF ENFORCEABILITY AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE -- RIGHT NOW THE ENFORCEABILITY TO GO OUT AND SAY YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE AGREE THAT THIS -- MANDATE -- TO HAVE CHOP ENTRY IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE THAT DOES GIVE -- LAW ENFORCEMENT SOME GUIDANCE AS TO WHAT THEY NEED TO BE DOING AND TAKES THE BURDEN THEY'LL STILL BE AN OUTRAGE BURDEN FOR US TO GO OUT THERE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE DATABASE IS BEING UPDATED -- BUT IT WON'T BE A SIGNIFICANT BECAUSETHERE WILL BE A MANDATE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENTER IT. AND I THINK THAT'S I THINK THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHAT WE DEFINITELY SUPPORT. GOT IT SIR MANDATING THAT THEIR REPORTS OF THIS INFORMATION IN THE DATABASES ARE THEY JUST NOT DOING IT -- RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO SEXUAL ASSAULT I WANNA MAKE THAT CLEAR YEAH. WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT OUTCOME REPORTING FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT IS ALREADY MANDATED THAT THEY TRACK THE KIDS NOW -- IN THE SAFETY DATABASE -- MEETING WITH A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS THEY ACTUALLY PUT THE INFORMATION IN THERE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT PERSPECTIVE LOOK AT WHAT'S OUT THERE -- AND A FEW OTHER DATA POINTS THAT THAT WILL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO REPORT ON THIS YEAR -- ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT ONCE THE NOTIFICATION HAS BEEN MADE IF WE'RE IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS IS KIND OF A SPLIT PROCESS. THE LABORATORIES RUN THE EVIDENCE GET A DNA PROFILE GET IT INTO THE SYSTEM AND GET THE HIT NOTIFICATION OUT AND WE HAVE A LOT OF HIT NOTIFICATIONS IN CALIFORNIA SINCE THE DATABASE INCREASED SO MUCH IN SIZE. WE HAVE THE FOURTH LARGEST DATABASE IN THE WORLD. SO IT'S VERY IT'S A VERY LARGE DATA -- SO AS OUR HIT NOTIFICATIONS INCREASE WE STOP AT SENDING OUT THE HIT NOTIFICATION AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE OUTCOMES. WASN'T INVESTIGATED WAS ITS PROSECUTED WAS IT A JUDICATA WAS THERE AN EXONERATION THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE ASKING -- TO BE TRACKED AND THAT WE WERE TRYING TO ASK NICELY THROUGH THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING PROCESS BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS THEIR OWN RESOURCE ISSUES. BUT AS FAR AS GETTING THAT INFORMATION AND WE FEEL THAT'S THE WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET IT. YEAH AND I THINK HEARD SEVERAL PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TESTIMONY ABOUT THE OUTCOMES WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS OR TESTING EVERY KID FOR OTHER CASES -- BUT THE OUTCOME INFORMATION I THINK ALSO WILL LET US KNOW BETWEEN EACH LAW ENFORCEMENT OR PERHAPS A VERY EVERY COUNTY -- WHY THEY'RE NOT TESTING THINGS IT WAS IT WAS CONSENSUAL BUT DOES THAT ACTUALLY STILL FACTOR INTO ANOTHER CASE AND I THINK MISS AMOUNT YOU TALKED ABOUT? SOME OF THAT -- AS WELL AND I'M STERN FIGURE FROM THE AGES PERSPECTIVE HOW DO WE MOVE THAT ALONG SHORT OF DOING -- A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE YOU'RE SAYING THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATE IS CAN I GET SAYS THERE BUT FOR DOJ'S. POINT YOU'RE TRYING. I GUESS FOR YES -- YEAH AND THE WHY A OR IF A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY DID NOT TURN A SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KIT INTO A LABORATORY IS SOMETHING THAT IS TRACKED IN THE SAFETY DATABASE. WHETHER OR NOT IT ACTUALLY WENT TO A CRIME LAB -- SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO REPORT ON IN THE SAFETY REPORT TO THIS YEAR -- THE OUTCOME INFORMATION AS TO WHY IT WAS INVESTIGATED -- THAT. MAY OR MAY NOT BE ENTERED AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW -- THE WISE -- IT'S MOSTLY JUST DID THIS LEAD TO AN INVESTIGATION DID THIS LEAD TO A PROSECUTION. SO WITH THE SAFETY DATABASE CAN WE ASCERTAIN HOW MANY KIDS HAVE BEEN SITTING THERE FOR X. AMOUNT OF YEARS OF SAFE WE WANTED TO RUN REPORT AND SAY HOW MANY KIDS HAVE BEEN. LEFT FOR EIGHT PLUS YEARS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE DATABASE CAN PROVIDER NOW ONLY FROM JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN FORWARD. ONLY AS OF LAST YEAR BUT THERE WAS LEGISLATION IN FUNDING THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR ALSO -- THAT GAVE MONEY TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GO IN AND DO THEIR AUDIT. SO THAT AND I KNOW THAT THEIR BEEN. THINK ABOUT NINE OR TEN AGENCIES IN THE STATE BUT THERE IS MONEY THAT THE BUT IN THE BUDGET FROM LAST YEAR JUST TO DO THE OUGHT. OKAY PERHAPS AS A FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEES. ALL RIGHT -- WITH THAT LET ME ASK THERE'S ANY MORE QUESTIONS. SENATOR LEYVA PLEASE. PLEASE. THANK YOU WELL MISTER CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY SINCE I DON'T SIT ON THE COMMITTEE BUT THIS IS JUST SOMETHING I'M INCREDIBLY PASSIONATE ABOUT -- WE HAVE A LOT OF OUR CHAMPIONS HERE TODAY DO MALLEY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE ELSA CONNECT FROM THE JOYFUL HEART FOUNDATION AND THE TASHA SIMONE. ON CINCO FROM NATASHA'S JUSTICE PROJECT WE ALL WORKED VERY HARD LAST YEAR ON SB OF FOURTEEN FORTY NINE GOT IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND HE VETOED THE BILL. WHICH WAS VERY DISHEARTENING BUT WE STILL PERSIST BECAUSE IT'S JUST THAT IMPORTANT AND IN THE LAW DOES THE CHANGE BECAUSE THE LAWS PERMISSIVE NOW AND IT SAYS. THEY SHOULD BE TESTED AND WE SEE THAT THAT HAS CREATED THIS BACKLOG AND IF WE CAN CHANGE ONE WORD TO SHALL BE TESTED. THEN WE KNOW THAT WE WILL EVER HAVE A BACKLOG AGAIN SO -- I THINK ALL OF YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO AND FOR ALL THE STRONG SUPPORTERS AND FOR WHAT YOU DO. YOU KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHEN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB EIGHT THIRTEEN ELIMINATING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON RAPE. INTO LAW THIS IS JUST THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP AND I JUST DON'T EVER WANT PEOPLE TO FORGET THAT. A RAPE VICTIM CANNOT BECOME A SURVIVOR UNTIL THEIR KID IS TESTED AND AS YOU HEARD THE CHAIR SAY THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT. WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN RAPED OR ASSAULTED IF THAT PERSON HAD BEEN PUT BEHIND BARS SO THIS IS JUST THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP AND WE NEED TO DO THIS SO THANK YOU ALL FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. FOR ALLOWING ME TO SAY A FEW WORDS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN. I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS AND SUBCOMMITTEES BUT EVEN AS LEGISLATION MOVES FORWARD -- WITH THAT LET'S GO TO MOVE TO OUR OUR NEXT PANELIST COMMENTS FROM SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS ADVOCATE GROUPS WE HAVE -- THE DIRECTOR POLICY AND ADVOCACY FOR THE JOYFUL HEART FOUNDATION. YEP ALSO CONNECT NATASHA A LINK -- AUTHORED SPOKES PERSON FOR NATASHA'S JUSTICE PROJECT. THANK YOU GUYS FOR BEING HERE AND HOPEFULLY -- YOU'VE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THE TESTIMONY AND HOPEFULLY IT'S HELPFUL. THANK YOU PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. YOU WANT ME TO GO FIRST. THE EITHER YEAH OKAY OKAY -- JUST IDENTIFIED IN THE RECORD ESTAS A GOOD MORNING BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE ESTA MORNING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME -- I AM ALSO CONNECTED THE PULSING ADVOCACY DIRECTOR FOR THE JOYFUL HEART FOUNDATION -- I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE OF UNTESTED RAPE KITS FOR TWENTY YEARS. A JOYFUL HEART WAS FOUNDED BY LAW AND ORDER ACTORS AN ADVOCATE MARCIA HARGETT TODAY. AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WE MADE ELIMINATING THE RAPE KIT BACKLOG OUR TOP ADVOCACY PRIORITY. TO THAT END WE ARE LEADING A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO PASS LEGISLATION IN EVERY STATE. THAT ENSURES THAT EVERY KID IS TESTED IN THE BACKLOG NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. LAST YEAR IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE PASSED FIFTY BILLS IN THIRTY TWO STATES AFFECTING A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND SURVIVORS. SO YOU'VE HEARD IT A LOT TODAY -- DNA EVIDENCE CONTAINED IN RATE CUTS IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO SOLVE AND PREVENT CRIME. WHEN TESTED IT CAN IDENTIFY UNKNOWN OFFENDERS THEY CAN LINK CRIMES TOGETHER OF COURSE THIS IS HOW WE FIND A SERIAL RAPIST AND? IT CAN ALSO EXONERATE THE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED AND THAT HAS HAPPENED BY TESTING RIGHT KIDS. NEWS WHEN I READ A FEW RAPE KIT TESTING SUCCESS HEADLINES FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. FROM THIS LAST YEAR. MEMPHIS MAN CONVICTED IN TWO THOUSAND RAPE AFTER DNA LINKED HIM TO ATTACK. TESTING OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SEXUAL ASSAULT KIT LEADS TO ORGAN RAPE CONVICTION. ARREST MADE IN HOC I THINK IT'S HOPE COUNTY RAPE KIDNAPPING COLD CASE AFTER REAP CA IS SENT FOR DNA TESTING. SIMILAR HEADLINES ARE PUBLISHED EVERY SINGLE DAY AND I WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT AGAIN THE TRAGIC NORTH CAROLINA CASE WHERE. THE MURDER AND RAPE OF A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. AFRICA A RAPE KIT -- FAULT HAD BEEN FOLLOW UP FOLLOWED UP ON CITY SORRY. AND ALSO JUST TO MENTION I AM JUST A FOLLOW UP ON WHAT DO MALLEY SAID THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT CASE TESTS -- WHERE RICK IT WAS TESTED AND A STRANGER RAPE WAS SOLVED BECAUSE AN ACQUAINTANCE RAPE? WAS IN THE SYSTEM SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LEAD. ON THE STRANGER RAPE THE PERSON'S DNA WAS NOT THE DATABASE BECAUSE THE TWO CASES CONNECTED AND THEY COULD GO BACK TO THE QUEEN'S RAPE FILE AND THEY GOT A NAME THEY WERE ABLE TO SOLVE THAT CRIME. THE DETROIT WHERE THEY'VE TESTED MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND RAPE KITS THEY HAVE DISCOVERED MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED SERIAL OFFENDERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES. ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND FORTY STATES AND WASHINGTON DC LIKE MY ALL KINDS OF CRIMES AND THEY COMMIT ALL KINDS OF RAPE AGAINST PEOPLE THEY KNOWN PEOPLE THEY DON'T KNOW. AND CLEVELAND IS IDENTIFIED MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED ZERO MIGHT PASS AS WELL. IN ADDITION RESEARCH OUT OF THE BEGUN CENTER AT CASE WESTERN UNIVERSITY IN CUYAHOGA COUNTY FOUND THAT SERIAL RAPISTS ARE. FAR MORE COMMON THAN WE PREVIOUSLY KNEW AND THEIR RECOMMENDATION IS NOW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE RATE CASE AS A POSSIBLE SERIAL CASE. SO THE VALUE OF TESTING RATE CUTS IS UNDENIABLE IN THE NEED FOR REFORM IS ALSO UNDENIABLE. WE HAVE PLENTY OF EVIDENCE NOW THAT TESTING EVERYTHING OVER IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND THE THING IS THIS IS A FIXABLE PROBLEM WE ACTUALLY CAN FIX THIS. BUT IT NEEDS TO BE LEGISLATED. SO YOU MAY BE ASKING WHAT DOES COMPREHENSIVE RATE CAN REFORM LOOK LIKE WELL CHOICE FOR HER DOES DEVELOP SIX ESSENTIAL PILLARS FOR RATE CAN'T REFORM ONE IS AN ANNUAL STATEWIDE INVENTORY. COUNTING ALL UNTESTED KIDS ON A RECURRING BASIS. REQUIRING THE SUBMISSION OF ALL PREVIOUSLY UNTESTED CATS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT -- AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE ARE SENT TO A LAB AND TESTED IN A TIMELY MANNER -- I WANT TO MAKE ONE NOTE THAT THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ANONYMOUS KIDS OR THE ON REPORTED KIDS WHICH IS A WHOLE OTHER TOPIC BUT YOU KNOW CASUALLY -- SURVIVORS THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE EVIDENCE COLLECTED AND NOT NECESSARILY PARTICIPATE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS SO THAT KßT CAN JUST BE HELD UNTIL THEY MAYBE MAKE THAT DECISION TO GO FOR IT SO. WE DO NOT SUGGEST TESTING THOSE KIDS WITHOUT SURVIVOR PERMISSION. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RAPE KITS THAT ARE CONNECTED TO A REPORTED CRIME. THE MANDATORY TESTING OF NEW KIDS REQUIRING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SUBMIT ALL CATS THAT ARE CONNECTED TO REPORTED CRIME FOR TESTING WITH IN A TIMELY MANNER -- WE SUGGEST WITHIN SEVEN DAYS AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE ARE TIME LINES THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS OF FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN A KID IS COLLECTED AT? THE MEDICAL CENTER OR EVEN SOMETIMES A A RATE TREATMENT CENTER -- TO MANDATE THAT THOSE KIDS ACTUALLY GET PICKED UP BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY ACT THEY WILL SIT AT THE HOSPITAL NEVER BE PICKED UP FROM THE HOSPITAL. SO IN MANDATE FORTY EIGHT HOURS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PICK UP THE CAT FROMTHE HOSPITAL. SEVEN DAYS TO SEND IT ON TO A LAB FOR TESTING AND THEN WE SUGGEST LAGGED LAB TURN AROUND TIMES FOR TESTING AS WELL. TRACKING SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT THE RAPE KITS ARE TRACKED FROM POINT A TO POINT C. SO THIS WOULD INCLUDE -- YOU KNOW WHAT WHOEVER BUYS THE CAT IF IT'S THE HOSPITAL OR THE STATE LAB YOU KNOW SUB A BAR CODE ON THAT. NO WHERE IT STARTS NO WHEN IT GOES TO THE HOSPITAL KNOW WHEN IT'S USED AT THE HOSPITAL KNOW WHEN IT'S PICKED UP FROM THE HOSPITAL. AND THE NO ONE IS LOGGED INTO EVIDENCE. AT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEN ALSO AT THE LAB AND WHAT HAPPENS THROUGH THE LAB PROCESS. THAT IS A WAY TO INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THREE CAN HANDLING SYSTEM. AND BUILD IN A WAY FOR SURVIVORS TO BE ABLE TO LOG INTO THAT SYSTEM TO CHECK WHERE THE RAPE KIT IS AT ALL TIMES BECAUSE MANY OF THEM LEAVE THE HOSPITAL THEY NEVER EVER HEAR AGAIN. WHERE THEIR KID IS? A VICTIMS RIGHTS TO KNOW THE STATUS OF THEIR CATS -- SING LEGISLATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT GRANTS VICTIMS THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHERE THEIR KID AS IN MOST STATES THEY DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW AND MANY OF THEM AGAIN. NEVER FIND OUT WHERE THEIR KID IS AND THEN OF COURSE FUNDING FOR ALL OF THESE REFORMS -- IT DOES COST MONEY TO TEST RATE CUTS AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE. TO STEP UP AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SUPPORTING THESE EFFORTS ARE APPROPRIATIONS. SO TODAY TWENTY THREE STATES HAVE MANDATED THE COLLECTION OR THE TESTING OF NEWLY COLLECTED RATE CUTS. TEN STATES REQUIRE THE TESTING OF BOTH BACKLOG AND NEWLY COLLECTED KIDS THE STATE'S OUR COLORADO GEORGIA HAWAII ILLINOIS KENTUCKY MASSACHUSETTS NEW YORK OHIO PENNSYLVANIA AND TEXAS. HOW YA KENTUCKY MASSACHUSETTS NEW YORK AND TAXES ALL HAVE ENACTED FULL REFORM? AND MASSACHUSETTS IN KENTUCKY JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. MICHIGAN OF SORRY COLORADO ILLINOIS MICHIGAN NEVADA OHIO UTAH AND WASHINGTON STATE ARE ALSO CLOSE TO FULL REFORM. THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO JOIN THIS GROWING LIST OF STATES THAT ARE REFORMING THE WAY THAT THEY'RE HANDLING RIGHT KIDS. HERE'S A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE CALIFORNIA STANDS ON REFORM AND WE'VE BEEN HERE A LONG TIME SO I HAVE. A LOT IN MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT SO FAR CALIFORNIA HAS PASSED FOUR OF OUR SIX PILLARS. THAT IS THE INVENTORY THAT WE WE PASSED LAST YEAR WITH A SOME IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU -- TO MANDATE A ONE TIME AUDIT OF UNTESTED KIDS YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A SENSE RIGHT NOW HOW THAT STUFF'S GOING BUT IT IS A MANDATE -- AND THE RESULTS ARE DUE IN JULY OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO THAT'S A ONE TIME ON IT WE LIKE TO SEE THAT RECURRING -- THERE'S TRACKING OF COURSE YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT TODAY THROUGH THE CAL DOJ TRACKING SYSTEM THERE ARE SOME HOLES IN THAT -- DID YOU HAVE VICTIMS RATES CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST STATES TO PASS A VICTIM'S RIGHT TO KNOW THE STATUS OF THEIR CAT AND TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AND THEN FUNDING OF COURSE YOU HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT WAS PUT INTO -- THE BUDGET LAST YEAR. SO THE ROAD AHEAD OF HER HEAD COUNT FOR CALIFORNIA -- YOU KNOW WE WE WERE PART OF THE THE PUSH LAST YEAR AGAIN WITH NATASHA -- AND DO MALATE TO GET. A MANDATORY TESTING OF RICH KIDS IN CALIFORNIA AND AS YOU HEARD THE GOVERNOR VETOED THAT BILL. I'M MORE WORKING ON THAT NOW WOULD LIKE TO PUT CALIFORNIA ON OUR MAP. A FULL REFORM ME LIKE THEM LIKE TO JOIN. THE STATE'S LIKE AWAY KENTUCKY AND TEXAS -- AND BE IN THE FIRST TEN STATES TO DO SO I THINK IT'S A IS -- SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO AND CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE A LEADER IN THIS AREA. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA ARE TOO FIRST AND FOREMOST PASSED SENATE BILL -- TWENTY TWO THIS SESSION A MANDATE THAT TESTING OF ALL CATS -- I DO WANT TO MENTION I I DO THINK -- AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS FITS BUT THERE ARE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO ARE SENDING. KIDS DIRECTLY FROM THE COLLECTION POINT TO THE LAB AND SKIPPING LAW ENFORCEMENT ALTOGETHER I THINK THAT THAT IS A FABULOUS IDEA -- WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO MANDATE -- PARTICIPATION IN TO THE CODIS -- HEAD OUT COME PROJECT PLATFORM -- I THINK THAT THAT WOULD MEAN A FOLLOWING WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THESE KIDS ON THIS TESTING SOUP IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR KIDS IN CALIFORNIA. SO IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN JOYFUL HEARTS A PROJECT CALLED THE ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT ISSUED FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUESTS ARE OPEN RECORDS REQUEST. TO EIGHT JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND FOUND THAT SIX OUT OF EIGHT OR 75%. ARE EITHER NOT FOLLOWING THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE LAW AS IT STANDS NOW WHICH BASICALLY SUGGESTS SENDING RIGHT KITS FOR TESTING -- OR THEY HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW MANY RAPISTS ARE RECEIVING AND WHERE THEY ARE AND WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN SENT TO A LAB FOR TESTING. SO RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA DESPITE ALL THE PROOF THAT TESTING RIGHT KIDS. IS THE BEST PRACTICE WHETHER OR NOT EVERY KID GETS TESTED A PINT DEPENDS ON THE SURVIVORS OF CODE. AND THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE. SO AS SOON AS A STATEWIDE INVENTORY IS DONE THEN THE STATE MUST MOVE QUICKLY TO MANDATE TESTING OF ALL THE KIDS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE INVENTORY ALL THOSE KIDS THAT ARE CONNECTED TO A REPORTED CRIME. AND THEN IN ADDITION TO OUR STATE APPROPRIATIONS FOR TESTING THOSE KIDS THERE ARE FERTILE GROUND SUCH AS A SEXUAL ASSAULT KIT INITIATIVE GRANT PROGRAMMER SAKE. TO SUPPORT THE TESTING OF KIDS INVESTIGATE THE CASES THAT COME OUT OF THAT PROSECUTING THOSE CASES AND RE ENGAGING SURVIVORS AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS AS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE GRANT PROGRAM -- I SPOKE JUST A MINUTE AGO ABOUT THE ANNUAL INVENTORY -- THAT REQUIRES A LONG FOR CEMENT. AGENCY IS -- TO AND OTHER FACILITIES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION LIKE TO SEE THAT BI ANNUAL. THE WRITTEN INVENTORY THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER AB FORTY ONE THROUGH THE CAL DOJ SYSTEM ONLY INCLUDES INFORMATIONS ABOUT GETS A LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTER INTO THE PROCESS INTO THE SYSTEM. SO THERE'S A WHOLE THERE AND THAT IT'S NOT INCLUDING KIDS THAT ARE -- OUR MEDICAL FACILITIES OR HOSPITALS OR OTHER CENTERS THAT NEVER MAKE IT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT SO AS SUCH THE INVENTORY. ONLY REALLY GIVES THAT INVENTORY ONLY REALLY GIVES A PARTIAL SNAPSHOT OF GREAT CAN HANDLING IN THE STATE. ALSO -- THE RATE TO SAFETY SYSTEM -- IT SHOULD PROVIDE A WAY FOR SURVIVORS TO LOG IN TO THE SYSTEM ANONYMOUSLY AND LOOK FOR THEIR KID AND TO SEE WHERE THEIR CAT IS -- SO WE WE LIKE TO SEE THAT ONLINE ANONYMOUS PORTAL FOR SURVIVORS -- TO TO CHECK ON WHETHER CAT AS AND THAT HELPS ALSO OPERATIONALIZE THE SURVIVORS RIGHT TO KNOW THE STATUS OF THEIR CAT. SO -- WE'VE ALSO HEARD ANECDOTES ACROSS THE STATE HAT SURVIVORS ARE NOT OFTEN ABLE TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR KID IT IS THE STATE LAW. SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THIS COMMITTEE IN COMMITTEE INVESTIGATE HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT OPPRESSORS OFFICES ARE ENSURING THAT SURVIVORS HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. AND OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONTINUE TO APPROPRIATE. SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO CARRY OUT COMPREHENSIVE REFORM MASSACHUSETTS JUST PAST EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. A FEW DAYS AGO AND THEIR BUDGET. NOW TEXAS ELEVEN NINE IT'S A HUGE STATE -- TO SO IN CLOSING -- WE OFFER OUR RESOURCES OUR EXPERTISE AND SUPPORT FROM THE JOYFUL HEART FOUNDATION HELPS CALIFORNIA GET TO FULL REFORM. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN EVERY BACKLOG CREATE GREAT KID IS TESTED. AND THE NO MATTER THERE'S A CODE SURVIVORS. NEWLY COLLECTED CUTS ARE TESTED EXPEDITIOUSLY AND THAT'S WHEN I SAY THE STAKES ARE ARE TOO HIGH YOU'VE HEARD IT HERE TODAY -- TO STRIVE FOR ANYTHING ELSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THINK REGIS MONEY WILL MOVE TO ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY ON QUESTIONS. PLEASE SO I GO. THANK YOU -- I I FIRST WANT TO START OF COURSE I'M A SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL ASSAULT I AM A SURVIVOR OF OF THE BACKLOG -- AND I I JUST REALLY WANT TO LET YOU KNOW HOW ABSOLUTELY HUMBLED I AM TO BE HERE -- TO SHARE MY STORY. THERE'S JUST NO WORDS -- AND AND JUST TO SEE THE CHAMPIONS IN CALIFORNIA THAT I'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR SO LONG -- FOR RAPE KIT REFORM IT'S JUST INSPIRING AND AND AND JUST. JUST SO YOU KNOW THEIR SURVIVORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT LOOK TO SOME OF THE CHAMPIONS HERE IN. CALIFORNIA THE FIGHTING SO HARD AND AND WE JUST KNOW AND ADORE THEM. ALL SO I'M AND IT'S REALLY A HUMBLING EXPERIENCE TO BE HERE. ON I WAS -- I WAS RAPED AND ROBBED AT GUNPOINT BY AN UNKNOWN ASSAILANT -- TO SAY THAT IT WAS LIFE CHANGING AS IS A GREAT UNDERSTATEMENT -- AND THEN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY IT NOT ONLY CHANGE MY LIFE BUT THE LIFE OF PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY MY MOTHER IN PARTICULAR. MY FRIENDS I MEAN THIS WAS A CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED ON ME BUT JUST AFFECTED SO MANY -- OF COURSE AFTER I WAS ASSAULTED -- MY FIRST INSTINCT OF COURSE WAS TO TAKE A SHOWER BECAUSE YOU YOU JUST YOU KNOW WANT TO FORGET EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO JUST ERASE. EVERY HORRIBLE THING THAT'S JUST HAPPEN TO YOU -- BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR BODY HAS BECOME A CRIME SCENE -- AND SO I I DID DO A RAPE KIT TESTS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ASSAULT. THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO CERTAINLY HAPPY SOMETHING I DID NOW -- YOU KNOW AFTER AN ASSAULT TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF HAVING A RAPE KITS ON YOU ARE POKED AND PRODDED. AT A MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE. WHERE YOU JUST DON'T WANT ANYTHING MORE TO DO WITH WHAT JUST HAPPENED HE WON A MAYBE YOU KNOW IN MY IN MY CASE I WANTED TO JUST CRAWL INTO A BALL AND FORGET ANYTHING IT JUST HAPPENED? SO ONCE AGAIN YEARS SPLAYED OUT YOUR ASK QUESTIONS YOU'RE ASKED TO RECALL THINGS YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- BUT I RECOGNIZE IN THAT MOMENT THAT A RAPE KIT WAS SO NECESSARY BECAUSE IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO FIND. THIS PERSON THAT HAD DONE THAT AWFUL THING TO ME AND THAT AWFUL THING TO MY BODY. I HAD NO IDEA AT THE TIME THAT MY RAPE KIT WOULD SIT ON A SHELF FOR NINE AND A HALF YEARS COLLECTING DUST. NO IDEA -- IN MY CASE I HAD NO IDEA MY RAPE KIT HAD NOT BEEN TESTED I WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T EVEN DAWN ON ME THAT IT WASN'T. BECAUSE I COULD IMAGINE HAVING BEEN PUT THROUGH THAT PROCESS FOR NOTHING -- SO THOSE YEARS OF THOSE NINE AND A HALF YEARS WHERE'D HEARD NOTHING. I BEGAN BLAMING MYSELF FOR NOT HAVING PUT THAT PERPETRATED BEHIND BARS. THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND HE HEARD OTHERS I DON'T THINK IT TAKES -- A PSYCHOLOGIST TO SAY OKAY SOMEONE WHO PUTS A GUN TO SOMEONE'S HEAD. AND RAPES THEM IS GOING SUDDENLY BECOME A PILLAR OF STAFF SOCIETY HAD IF THEY'RE NOT KIND OF CAUGHT IN AND SO ON SO I KNEW HE WAS OUT THERE HARMING OTHERS. AND THE ENTIRE TIME I REALLY TOOK THE ONUS OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HAVING SUCH A DANGEROUS PERSON. ON MYSELF I BLAME MYSELF PERHAPS THEY DIDN'T. ARTICULATE LAW ENFORCEMENT APPROPRIATELY AND SO I CAN I CARRY THAT FOR A LOT OF YEARS AND TELL MY MY CAT WAS TESTED -- FINALLY. AND ALTHOUGH IT TOOK MANY YEARS FOR ONCE THE KIT WAS TESTED THERE WAS INITIALLY NO MATCHING PROFILING COATIS. SO IT WASN'T UNTIL -- IS SEVEN YEARS LATER THAT I MATCH WAS MADE IN CODE S. AND THE MAN THAT RATE ME WAS APPREHENDED -- BUT NOT AFTER HE MADE A COMMITTED CRIMES IN EIGHT DIFFERENT STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND THE MAN THAT RATE ME WASN'T A SPECIALIST HE DIDN'T STICK TO SEXUAL ASSAULTS I'M HE COMMITTED A VARIETY OF CRIMES HE WAS A BURDEN ON TAXPAYERS HE WAS A BURDEN ON LAW ENFORCEMENT HE WAS A VERY DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL. THAT WAS OUT ON THE STREET -- THANKFULLY. AND THIS IS A RARITY. I I WAS ABLE TO SEE MY DAY IN COURT AND I DID I WAS ABLE TO TESTIFY. I WAS ABLE TO FACE THE MAN THAT ASSAULTED ME IN A COURT ROOM. AND I KNOW THAT I'M AND I'M ONLY AND I RECOGNIZE HOW. HOW IMPORTANT IS TO REALLY SPEAK OUT AND SAY THAT THIS IS NOT LIKE PAR FOR THE COURSE MY CASE ISN'T? HOW IT WORKS IT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE OF? IT WORKING WHILE -- SO AFTER I TESTIFIED. ON THE TORONTO SUN MAN THAT RATE MEAN WAS PUT BEHIND BARS TO TWENTY FIFTY SEVEN WHICH IS A GREAT TRIUMPH AND CERTAINLY A TRIUMPH. THAT IT DIDN'T COME BECAUSE OF ME BECAME BECAUSE THE PROSECUTORS. STRUCK WITH EVERYTHING LAW ENFORCEMENT IN MY CASE STUCK WITH EVERYTHING. AND IT WAS JUST THIS AMAZING TEAM THAT WORK TOGETHER FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF NOT ONLY ME IN FINDING JUSTICE BUT FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF SURVIVORS MOVING FORWARD AND AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND AND FOR ALSO PUBLIC SAFETY. SO. YOU KNOW MY STORY HAD IT HAD AN ENDING AND I HAVE -- I HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE CLOSURE ON MY CASE AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND I THINK WHAT ONE OF THE REASONS I I TALK ABOUT SOMETHING IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT. IS I I WANT TO ENSURE THAT I'M NOT AN ANOMALY AND THAT OTHER INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE THE JUSTICE. THAT I WAS REALLY FORTUNATE TO HAVE AND ALSO WE USE MY CASES AN EXPERIENCE FOR LEARNING AND A WAY TO KIND OF ENSURE THAT WE ARE USING BEST PRACTICES WE'RE MAKING SURE KIDS ARE TESTED. HIS IT'S IT'S GREAT THAT YOU CAN GATHER DATA AND WE SEE THE DATE AND IT'S REALLY OBVIOUS THAT WE SHOULD BE TESTING RAPE KITS BUT YOU'RE PUTTING SURVIVORS. IN PART OF THIS PROCESS I THINK IT'S JUST SO NECESSARY BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO GET LOST IN THE DATA. AND FORGET THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE ATTACHED TO THESE RAPE KITS THAT. WHOSE LIVES OF HAVE CHANGED FOREVER -- AND IT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT BIG I THINK IN MY CASE BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO RECEIVE CLOSURE AND I WAS TREATED WITH SUCH DIGNITY AND RESPECT -- I WAS KIND OF IN POWER TO BE ABLE TO COME OUT AN ADVOCATE AND BECOME AN ADVOCATE AND TALK ABOUT -- RAPE KIT REFORM AND AN AND I'M JUST SO INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT -- I YOU KNOW THIS IS IT'S INTERESTING THIS IS THE EIGHTH TIME I'VE COME TO THIS AMAZING STATE HOUSE WHICH I THINK IS JUST ABSOLUTELY. BREATHTAKING AND IT'S ALWAYS JUST. SUCH ON IT I'M JUST ALWAYS I AM IN AWE OF THIS BUILDING AND ALSO THE PEOPLE THAT. ARE IN IT -- SENATOR LEYVA WORKING EXTREMELY HARD ON THIS LEGISLATION. THAT I THINK IS SO IMPORTANT. AND AND I THINK. CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE HAS ALL THESE SUPER HEROES AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY TO LISTEN. TO THEIR EXAMPLES DA O'MALLEY AND WHAT SHE DONE AND ALAMEDA COUNTY IS AMAZING NOT NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIA BUT THE ENTIRE NATION -- AND I THINK THAT THERE'S JUST THESE AMAZING PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING GREAT THINGS IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO OF BILL DISLIKE COHESIVE UNIT AND CREATE LEGISLATION. SO THAT EVERYTHING IS CONSISTENT AND THAT SURVIVORS AND IN THE STATE RECEIVE JUSTICE -- AND THAT EVERYBODY KIND OF RECOGNIZES THAT IT'S OKAY TO COME FORWARD AND SAVE BEEN ASSAULTED BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS WORKING. FOR YOUR BEST INTERESTS I THINK YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT. RAPE BEING SO UNDERREPORTED IN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY AS OTHER SURVIVORS OF TOLD ME AS THAT THEY JUST DON'T TRUST THAT ANYTHING MORE IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THAT CASE. I MEAN CERTAINLY A LOT OF IT COMES FROM THE SHAME AND THE ME TOO MOVEMENT HAS CERTAINLY WORK TO EMPOWER SURVIVORS SO THEY CAN. SHARE THEIR STORIES MORE BUT A LOT OF TIME SURVIVORS JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE ANYTHING'S GOING TO BE DONE. AND THAT'S REALLY HEARTBREAKING IT'S IT AND IT'S REALLY. I THINK CITIZENS SHOULD ALSO BE OUTRAGE THAT THAT'S THE CASE BECAUSE AGAIN WHEN WE LOOK AT INDIVIDUALS WHO. COMMIT THESE KIND OF CRIMES THEY DON'T JUST STICK TO RATE THE CONTINUED EIGHT THE ESCALATE I MEAN THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE -- ALL PRETTY MUC COMMON SENSE AND AND I CAN SPEAK VERY SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THE MAN THAT RATE ME OPERATED IN THAT FASHION [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] I REMAIN. COMPLETELY COMMITTED -- AS I HAVE BEEN FOR MANY YEARS HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO DO ANYTHING TO UTILIZE MY STORY TO TO SHARE ANYTHING I CAN -- TO ENSURE THAT. CALIFORNIA BECOMES A STATE THAT LEADS THE NATION IN TERMS OF LEGISLATION I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT AND AND I THINK IT'S A YOUNG ONCE ONCE LEGISLATION IS TO SEE IT KIND OF HAVE THIS RIPPLE EFFECT AROUND THE COUNTRY -- AND HAVE OTHER STATES YOU KNOW TAKE ON SIMILAR THINGS. SO I AM HERE FOR ANYTHING YOU NEED AGAIN. COMPLETELY HUMBLE THAT I CAN SHARE MY STORY AND CERTAINLY GRATEFUL I'M HERE TODAY TO BE ABLE. TO TO TALK ABOUT IT -- AND I I THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR THE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE COURAGE AND STRENGTH TO CONTINUE TO TELL YOUR STORY LIKE YOU SAID I BELIEVE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE TO HAVE DIFFICULTY DOING THAT. SO PRO APOLOGY FOR FOR DOING THAT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT'S HELPING CREATE THE CHANGE THAT WE NEED TO SEE EVERYWHERE. AND SO ON THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE I DO WHAT I THINK -- SIR MORLOCK SIR WIENER FOR JOINING US AS WELL THANK YOU SO MAY I JUST ASK A GENERAL QUESTION AND YOU KNOW WE'VE BOTH OF YOUR TESTIMONIES TOUCHED UPON IT -- BUT ADDITIONALLY YOU FIRST BEGIN BY SAYING YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S BUT FOUR OF THE SIX PILLARS OF WERE MISSING THE OTHER. TWO AND I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE TWO WERE BECAUSE ONE SOUNDED LIKE TRACKING AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS AND GETS TO AND PUT INTO THE THE LONG FOR IT ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT GETS AND PUT INTO -- THE DATABASE I BELIEVE YOU SAID WELL RAPE CENTERS AND HOSPITALS TO NOT. SORE THAT WATER THE TWO PILLARS WERE STILL MISSING IN CALIFORNIA SO WE COULD. HAVE THIS FULL REFORM LIKE THE OTHER STATES DO RIGHT -- SO IT'S MANDATE IN THE TESTING OF NEWLY COLLECTED KITS WHICH SB TWENTY TWO WILL DO. MANDATING THAT TESTING OF ALL THE PREVIOUSLY UNTESTED AN UNSYMPATHETIC KIDS THAT WILL BE IDENTIFIED -- THROUGH THE STATE WIDE AUDIT -- AND THEN THERE ARE YOU KNOW OTHER LITTLE. TWO WEEKS -- TO THE TRACKING SYSTEM I THINK THAT -- ARE IMPORTANT GOT IT. OKAY I THINK WE JUST TRY TO FIND WAYS TO BE HELPFUL. AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE BEEN WE'VE HAD LEGISLATION THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST WE'VE HAD -- WE'VE UP PUTS MONEY IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WERE LOOKING TO PUT MONEY IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AGAIN I THINK CENTER BALLOT TALKED ABOUT THAT AND MISS WEBBER AS WELL. I MEAN IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE SHOULD BE DOING HIMCALIFORNIA ASIDE FROM WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON TOGETHER. TO TO KIND OF MOVE THIS ALONG OR ANYTHING THAT YOU REALIZE IN THE TESTIMONY MAYBE WITH PREVIOUS PANEL THAT. THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW UP ON BUT I ACT I THINK THAT THE OUTCOME INFORMATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT YOU HAVE TO MANDATE. THESE KINDS OF PARTICIPATION OF PARTICIPATION. SORRY OF YOU KNOW IT REALLY HASN'T HASN'T. BEEN WORKING -- IN TERMS OF IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE LAW THAT'S ON THE BOOKS NOW THAT SAYS THAT ONE PERSON SHOULD SEND. KIDS FOR TESTING -- THAT JUST HASN'T WORKED -- AS WELL INTENTIONED AT THE TIME BUT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WE HAVE TO MANDATE THAT I DO THINK -- THAT MANDATING PARTICIPATION IN SOME KIND OF OUTCOME. YOU KNOW PROJECT IN MAKING SURE THAT EVERY BIT Là PERSON HAS TO ENTER THE INFORMATION AND PROSECUTORS HAVE GENTRAN INFORMATION TO THAT. OTHERWISE YOU'RE JUST GONNA GET A PATCHWORK QUILT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND YOU REALLY WON'T GET THAT KIND OF SOLID. DATA THAT YOU THAT YOU WANT. AND I THINK THAT'S OF THOSE DEFINITELY IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDIT SENDS YOU KNOW AS PLEASED TO HEAR PART OF JUST TO SAY THAT SOMETHING THAT THEY THINK WE SHOULD MOVE TOWARDS AS WELL YEAH I MEAN THAT ACTUALLY WOULD BE -- EVER KIND OF A FIRST OF CALIFORNIA DID THAT -- THERE ARE OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DOING SIMILAR KIND OF OUTCOME -- HAVE SORT OF SIMILAR OUTCOME -- PROCESS -- PLATFORMS FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD -- BUT IN TERMS OF MANDATING SOMETHING LIKE THAT I MEAN THAT WOULD BE PRETTY -- GROUND BREAKING. YEAH NOW AND YEAH I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I KNOW IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL WE HEARD ABOUT -- WHETHER IT'S AN IMPLICIT BIAS OR BABY WAS. THEY FOUND THAT IT WAS CONSENSUAL SO THEY DECIDED NOT. TO SEND THE RAPE KIT TO THE TO BE TESTED BUT KNOWING THAT ACTUALLY HAS. A LOT OF OTHER IMPLICATIONS AS WELL RIGHT MORE DNA YOU HAVE INTO. INTO THE DATABASE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE IF THERE'S A PATTERN WITH THE SURNAME VISUAL AND AND HOW THAT -- PLAYS OUT WITH. OTHER -- POTENTIAL VICTIMS AS WELL. YEAH RIGHT RIGHT YEAH WE HAVE A A LOT OF INFORMATION IN OUR WRITTEN TESTIMONY ABOUT YOU KNOW WHY THE BACK LIKE OCCURS WHITE KIDS AREN'T SOME FOR TESTING -- ANYTHING TO THAT CAN YOU EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON BECAUSE YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT -- THE VICTIMS -- BEING ABLE TO LOG IN AND SEE THE STATUS OF THEIR KIDS AS SOMETHING THAT'S DONE IN OTHER STATES. YEAH QUITE A FEW QUITE A FEW STATES HAVE DONE THIS -- LET'S SAY MICHIGAN WASHINGTON STATE -- ARIZONA. IN TERMS SOME OF THE OTHER ONES ON NEVADA STANDING UP A SYSTEM NOW -- I CAN GET YOU A FULL LIST OF THAT BUT THAT IS IS SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY IS BUILT INTO MOST TRACKING SYSTEMS THAT ARE BEING STOOD UP NOW. IS THAT ANONYMOUS WAY FOR VICTIMS TO LOG IN THROUGH A PORTAL AND AND SEE WHETHER CANDACE AND YOU DON'T SEE THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY. NOT THAT I MEAN I COULD BE I COULD BE WRONG I JUST DON'T THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN. AWARE THAT IT EXISTS. ALL RIGHT ONE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS STILL IN THE ROOM FOR A BABY THE AUDITOR I CAN MAYBE I CAN ASK THE STATE AUDITOR'S A SOMETHING THAT YOU GUYS LOOKED AT OR NOW OKAY. HI WELL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON HER YEAH YEAH I THINK I THINK OF VICTIMS PORTAL IN IN TERMS OF THAT TRACKING IS IS. OFFICIAL FOR SO MANY ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS BUT YES CERTAINLY I THINK THAT I'VE HEARD THE SAME THING THAT CALIFORNIA HASN'T QUITE GOTTEN TO THAT POINT YET BUT AND I JUST MENTION THAT TO TASHA WAS PART OF SOME RESEARCH TREATED AT JOYFUL HEART FOUNDATION ABOUT VICTIM NOTIFICATION IN. THESE CASES THESE VERY OLD CASES WHERE YOU GET THEM NEW INFORMATION INDICATES CAM NEWLY ACTIVATED AFTER YOU KNOW DECADE SOMETIMES. HOW DO YOU GO TELL SURVIVORS? YOU KNOW WE HAVE NO INFORMATION IN YOUR CASE AFTER THE SYSTEM FAILED THEM SO POORLY -- AND SO WE'VE DONE RESEARCH ON THAT AND SURVIVORS TOLD US THAT. THAT HAVING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR CASE AND THEIR KID IS SO IMPORTANT TO THEIR HEALING IS VERY CENTRAL TO THEIR HEALING THEY REALLY STRONGLY FEEL THAT THAT INFORMATION BELONGS TO THEM AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO IT. ABSOLUTELY AND THAT ACTUALLY NOT THE NOT HAVING ACCESS TO IT ACTUALLY DOES NOT HARM. I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL WORKING SO HARD AND DILIGENTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT. AND JUSTICE IS MET FOR EVERYONE AND I KNOW CALIFORNIA FIRST WERE. TRYING TO TACKLE. HOW BIG OF A BACKLOG WE HAD HOW MANY KIDS HAVE BEEN SITTING? YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY FOR NOT NINE YEARS ARE NINE AND A HALF YEARS -- BECAUSE I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE UNDERTHE ASSUMPTION WHY DID THE KID AND IT SHOULD BE TESTED AND WHY WOULDN'T IT BE TESTED. AND SO -- YOU KNOW PLEASE BE LOOKING FOR TO THE AUDIT REPORT FOR LATER THIS YEAR AS WELL AS SEE WHAT THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE AT LOOK THE LOCAL LAW. AGENCIES THROUGHOUT TH STATE -- I THINK WE HAVE SOME GOOD EXAMPLES OF WHAT ALAMEDA IS DEFINITELY DOING. AND WHAT -- TA O'MALLEY. IS DOING THEIR MISTER CARTER TALKED ABOUT -- IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL AS WELL SO JUST OTHER JEFF CHAMPIONS HERE THAT WANT TO HELP CONTINUE TO HELP WE WANT TO BE -- WE WANT TO HIT ALL SIX OF THOSE PILLARS. AND THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IF THERE'S JUST A QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS. HEARING SEEING THEN -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND WITH THAT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND CONCLUDE -- THIS JOINT HEARING OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE THE ASSEMBLY. BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER FIVE ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE SENATE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE NUMBER FIVE A CORRECTIONS PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE JUDICIARY THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] YEAH.
