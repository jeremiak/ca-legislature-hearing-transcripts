THE QUESTION THAT I LOOK AT IN

00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:45.236
THIS MEASURE. IS AS A SOCIETY

00:36:45.303 --> 00:36:49.040

00:37:06.924 --> 00:37:09.193
JURISPRUDENTIAL BASIS FOR

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.795
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AND IF

00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:12.063
YOU WERE SOMEBODY VIOLATES THE

00:37:12.129 --> 00:37:14.031
LAW IT WANTS TO SUFFER THE

00:37:14.098 --> 00:37:15.800
CONSEQUENCES SO BE IT SO. WHEN

00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:17.335
I LOOK AT THAT LARGER STANDARD

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:18.669
APOLOGIES FOR GOING ALONG WITH

00:37:18.736 --> 00:37:20.404

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:22.173
TERMS OF LOOKING AT ALL OF THE

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:24.475
OTHER AREAS OF THE LAW IN WHICH

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:25.242
PEOPLE ARE INTERFACING WITH

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:27.211
THEIR GOVERNMENT. THIS JUST

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:29.280
SIMPLY SETS A STANDARD

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:31.649

ANYTHING. OTHER THAN THAT IT

00:37:41.192 --> 00:37:42.460
AND WHY SHOULD THE STANDARD BE

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:43.694
ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN ANY

00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:45.196
OTHER STANDARD ESPECIALLY THE

00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:46.130

00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:25.863
LESSONS OF FATE IN OUR MEMORY.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.198
PERHAPS WEEK WE MOVE A LITTLE

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:28.199
FASTER AND WRITING OUR NAME

00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:31.102
AND- IT POSES CHALLENGES

00:39:31.168 --> 00:39:31.769
BECAUSE THIS IS A HUMAN

00:39:31.836 --> 00:39:33.704
INTERPRETATION. THIS ISN'T A

00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:35.840
MACHINE INTERPRETATION AND

00:39:35.906 --> 00:39:36.974
ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND SOME OF

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.542
THEM ARE USED TO. DO A QUICK

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:40.444
SCREEN ON SOME OF THE STUFF-

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:42.379
IT'S A IT'S A PERSON AND SO IT

00:39:42.446 --> 00:39:44.181
IS IN IT BUT IT YOU KNOW AND

MIGHT. LOOK AT SOMETHING A

00:39:46.584 --> 00:39:48.119
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND SO I

00:39:48.185 --> 00:39:49.019
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHERE

00:39:49.086 --> 00:39:49.887
YOU'RE GOING WITH US AND I

00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:51.322
THINK THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS

00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:54.325
THAT WERE ISSUED. BY THE

00:39:54.391 --> 00:39:56.093

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.361
OF WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IN

00:39:57.428 --> 00:39:59.497
THIS BILL. AND I THINK UP WITH

00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:00.998
THE IDEA THAT WE WANT EVERY

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:02.333
VOTE TO COUNT AND THAT REALLY

00:40:02.399 --> 00:40:04.101
HAS TO BE AT. A HIGHER.

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:06.604
THRESHOLD TO ELIMINATE

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.038
SOMEONE'S VOICE THAN THEIR

00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:09.874
VOTE. I DO WANT TO ASK YOU

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.475
THOUGH TO SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:13.244
OF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT-

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.513
IT'S A STANDARD THAT- CAN BE

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:17.014
SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION AND

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:18.349
SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO. WHAT YOU

00:40:18.415 --> 00:40:19.483
THINK THAT MEANS AND WHAT THAT

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.619
COMMUNICATES TO OUR FIFTY EIGHT

00:40:21.685 --> 00:40:24.155

CHANGING PRESUMPTION. THAT NONE

00:40:51.248 --> 00:40:52.750
FROM THE PRESUMPTION THAT IT'S

00:40:52.817 --> 00:40:54.251
REALLY INVALID TO PRESUMPTION

00:40:54.318 --> 00:40:56.320
OF THE SIGNATURES VALID. AND

00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:57.855
FOR THAT THEN TO FEEL LIKE

00:40:57.922 --> 00:41:00.157
BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT THAT-

00:41:00.224 --> 00:41:02.726
THAT- THAT IT'S INVALID IN THAT

00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:04.662
PROCESS THEN. OF CHALLENGING

00:41:04.728 --> 00:41:06.630
THE SIGNATURE SO. THAT'S REALLY

00:41:06.697 --> 00:41:07.731
WHAT IT'S ABOUT TO US IS KIND

00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:09.500
OF CRAZY THAT LARGER THRESHOLD.

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:10.367
AND THIS IS THE PENLEE

00:41:10.434 --> 00:41:12.002
PERJURIOUS CENTER HERTZBERG.

00:41:14.004 --> 00:41:15.272
APPLIES. SO THIS IS REALLY

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:16.707
ABOUT BEGIN CHANGING THAT THAT

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:19.143
PRESUMPTION. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO

TEAM- FOR ANY CLARIFICATIONS ON

00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:23.747
US. NOT CREATE THAT TO SENATOR

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:25.816
BECKER I DO THINK THAT THE-

00:41:25.883 --> 00:41:27.785
STANDARDS THAT THE- EMERGENCY

00:41:30.387 --> 00:41:32.323
LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC MMHM-

00:41:32.389 --> 00:41:33.724
IN TERMS OF DETERMINING THAT A

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:36.360
SIGNATURE- WAS IT WAS VALID. I

00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:37.595
THINK THE PRESUMPTION OF COURSE

00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:39.763
WOULD BE THERE AS WELL. SO I

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.565
LOOK FORWARD TO THAT THAT THAT

00:41:41.632 --> 00:41:43.601
CONVERSATION AS THE BILL. GOES

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:45.703

THOSE PEOPLE WHO VOTED IN. OUR

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:58.082
ELECTIONS. THAT THE PERCENTAGE

00:41:58.148 --> 00:41:58.916
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO. IS

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:00.484
A FRACTION- A HALF OF ONE

00:42:00.551 --> 00:42:01.585
PERCENT. NO THAT'S NOT

00:42:01.652 --> 00:42:02.686
INSIGNIFICANT IT'S A LOT OF

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:04.121

00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:15.766

DISCHARGED FROM PAROLE THAT

CRITICAL AREAS OF STATE

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:29.151
STATUTORY LAW. SOME EXAMPLES

01:06:29.218 --> 01:06:30.953
ENACTED IN CALIFORNIA- THE

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.755
UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE UNIFORM

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.890
VOIDABLE TRANSACTIONS ACT. AND

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:36.359
SENATOR DODD'S UNIFORM

01:06:36.425 --> 01:06:37.893
RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.095

THREE UNIFORMED PEOPLE

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:46.635
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS ACT

01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:48.371
ADDRESSED THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:49.705
THAT HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:51.841
IN CALIFORNIA LAW. IT PROVIDES

01:06:51.907 --> 01:06:54.343
A FAR BETTER SOLUTION THAN OUR

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:56.112
EXISTING STATUTE. FOR MANY

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:57.713
YEARS CALIFORNIA LAW IS HELD

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.281
THAT A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTOR

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:00.716
VOTES CONTRARY TO HIS OR HR

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:02.885
COMMITMENT CAN BE FINED OR EVEN

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:05.020
IMPRISONED. THIS IS ALL WELL

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:06.989
AND GOOD BUT OUR EXISTING LAW

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:08.524
DOES NOTHING TO INVALIDATE THE

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:10.159
FACELESS VOTE. SO I UNDER

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:11.827
EXISTING LAW THE VOTE THAT THE

01:07:11.894 --> 01:07:14.363
FAITHLESS ELECTORS WILL STAND

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:14.930
IN THE WILL OF THE VOTERS WE

01:07:14.997 --> 01:07:16.966
FRUSTRATED. THE INFORMATICA

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:19.001
EMBODIED IN SB ONE OF THREE

01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:20.269
CREATES A MECHANISM THAT

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:21.670
PRETENSE OF FACELESS VOTE FROM

01:07:21.737 --> 01:07:24.006
COUNTING REPLACES THE FAITHLESS

01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:26.776
ELECTOR. THIS THIS IS SIMPLE

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:28.244
COMMON SENSE AND IN TWENTY

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:30.546
TWENTY. THE SUPREME COURT CASE

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:32.848
OF COLORADO B. BALK AT UNITED

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:34.250
STATES SUPREME COURT FOUND THAT

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:35.551
SUCH A MECHANISM IS

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:37.987
CONSTITUTIONAL. SIX STATES HAVE

01:07:38.053 --> 01:07:39.922
ALREADY ADOPTED THE UNIFORM ACT

01:07:39.989 --> 01:07:42.024
AND FOURTEEN OTHERS HAD THEIR

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:44.093
OWN VERY SIMILAR RULES. FEW

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.961
THINGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:46.495
A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE IN A

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:48.230
