00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:31.830
EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND AND FUNDING

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:32.764
FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:35.033
REDUCTION FUND TO SUPPORT CARD.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.135
LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS AND IMPACT

00:20:37.202 --> 00:20:38.036
TO COMMUNITIES IN THE

00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:40.706
IMPLEMENTATION OF SIX SEVENTEEN

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:41.673
AND THE REQUESTED --

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.275
WE HAVE STAFF AND CONTRACT FUNDS

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:45.744
WILL PROVIDE FIRST EXPERTISE.

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:47.045
IN THE INTERPRETATION OF

00:20:47.112 --> 00:20:48.380
POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS THAT

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:49.781
MAY RESULT FROM.

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:51.850
EXPOSURES TO AIR TOXICS OBSERVED

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:53.819
THROUGH AIR QUALITY MONITORING

00:20:53.885 --> 00:20:54.987
DATA.

00:20:55.053 --> 00:20:56.288
AND THE EVALUATION POTENTIAL

00:20:56.355 --> 00:20:58.056
HEALTH BENEFITS FROM REDUCING

00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:00.025
THOSE EXPOSURES SO TO PUT IT

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.627
SIMPLY WHEN COMMUNITIES ON IN

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:02.794
THE STEERING COMMITTEES ARE

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:04.096
CONSIDERING.

00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:07.766
CHEMICALS TO MONITOR AND READ

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:08.934
WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THE HEALTH

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:11.069
IMPACTS AND UNDERSTAND THE

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:13.839
IMPORTANCE OF THE REDUCTION SAID

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:15.707
AND THE MONITORING THAT'S BEING.

00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:17.209
CONSIDERED.

00:21:17.275 --> 00:21:18.377
THE SECOND THING IS TO DEVELOP

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:20.479
HEALTH GUIDANCE VALUES NEEDED TO

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:22.280
FULLY ANALYZE HEALTH EFFECTS AND

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:23.815
THE BENEFITS OF REDUCING

00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:25.183
EMISSIONS TO THOSE.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.152
POLLUTANTS THESE GUIDANCE VALUES

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:29.187
TYPICALLY IDENTIFY LEVELS OF

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:30.922
AIRBORNE POLLUTANTS THAT DO NOT

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:33.959
POSE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH RISKS.

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:35.460
SO WITH THE MONITORING.

00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:36.928
SHOWS LEVELS OF A POLLUTANT

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:38.864
ABOVE THE GUIDANCE LEVEL IT

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.732
RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HEALTH

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:42.467
RISKS WE HAVE --

00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:44.803
GUIDANCE LEVELS FOR MANY

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:45.971
CONTAMINANTS.

00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:47.873
WE'RE ANTICIPATING THE NEED FOR

00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:50.342
GUIDANCE VALUES FOR MANY MORE.

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:53.578
THE SIX SEVENTEEN PROGRAM MOVES

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:55.547
FORWARD ERMS OF WHAT MONITORED

00:21:55.614 --> 00:21:58.016
AND WHAT'S IDENTIFIED THROUGH

00:21:58.083 --> 00:21:59.518
THE MISSIONS INVENTORIES.

00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:01.119
AND THE THIRD THING IS FOR THE

00:22:01.186 --> 00:22:02.154
DESIGN.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.122
AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TARGETED

00:22:04.189 --> 00:22:06.324
BY A MONITORING STUDIES TO TRACK

00:22:06.391 --> 00:22:08.860
EXPOSURES IN COMMUNITIES.

00:22:08.927 --> 00:22:11.063
SO BY MONITORING PROVIDES LEVEL --

00:22:11.129 --> 00:22:13.398
INFORMATION ON WHAT'S IN PEOPLE

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:14.833
CHEMICALS AND IN THAT ARE

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.902
MEASURED IN HUMANS AND IT'S SO

00:22:16.968 --> 00:22:18.470
IT'S A REAL DIRECT MEASUREMENT

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:20.205
OF EXPOSURE.

00:22:20.272 --> 00:22:21.707
AND BIOMONITORING ANSWERS KEY

00:22:21.773 --> 00:22:24.142
QUICK KEY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:27.913
LEVEL AND EXTENT OF EXPOSURE --

00:22:27.979 --> 00:22:30.515
POLLUTION CAN VARY WIDELY ACROSS

00:22:30.582 --> 00:22:31.683
A GIVEN AREA.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.919
AND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE A

00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:35.854
LARGE BLUE --

00:22:35.921 --> 00:22:37.622
CONTINUOUS ARE LARGE POLLUTANT

00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:39.658
SOURCES ARE KIND OF A IN A

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:40.992
SPECIAL CONCERN.

00:22:41.059 --> 00:22:42.394
IN BY A MONITORING CAN HELP

00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:44.863
IDENTIFY INCREASE LEVELS OF

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.832
INDIVIDUALS IN THOSE

00:22:46.898 --> 00:22:47.799
NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:48.867
SO -- SO THE

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:53.338
TARGET CAN COMPLEMENT.

00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:55.874
EXISTING MONITORING.

00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:56.975
THE MASS THE QUESTION I KNOW

00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:58.810
WHEN WE HAD OUR DEBATE LAST YEAR

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:00.612
WITH LEAD PAINT I COME FROM AN

00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:02.280
AREA THAT HAS A LARGE.

00:23:02.347 --> 00:23:04.349
INDO AMERICAN POPULATION HAS A

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:06.184
LARGE LATINO POPULATION THEY

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:08.120
MEASURED LEAD CONTAMINATION IN

00:23:08.186 --> 00:23:10.188
CHILDREN AND FOUND IN SOME

00:23:10.255 --> 00:23:11.757
NEIGHBORHOODS AND EXCEEDINGLY

00:23:11.823 --> 00:23:14.326
HIGH AMOUNT OF OF LEAD.

00:23:14.392 --> 00:23:15.727
IN IN IN THE THOUGHT --

00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:17.195
THIS MUST BE LEAD PAINT.

00:23:17.262 --> 00:23:20.766
EXPOSURE OR F. EXIDE EXPOSURE

00:23:20.832 --> 00:23:22.267
WHATEVER WHATEVER FOLKS WANT OF

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:23.735
HIM LIVE AN EXCITING AND THEN ON

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:25.170
FURTHER LOOK THOUGH THE

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:26.772
MEASUREMENT WAS THEIR HIGH THEY

00:23:26.838 --> 00:23:28.240
FOUND OUT THAT --

00:23:28.306 --> 00:23:29.674
WITHIN THE INDO COMMUNITY THURS

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:31.710
CERAMIC PAINTING THAT IS PUT ON

00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:33.812
CHILDREN'S I LET'S AND THINGS

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:37.249
LIKE THAT THAT HAS LED IN IT

00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:38.950
THEY GIVES THAT.

00:23:39.017 --> 00:23:40.752
A KILLER INDIVIDUAL HIGH LEVEL

00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:41.386
SAME THING WITH THE THE JEWELRY

00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:42.687
WE GET FROM SOUTH OF THE BORDER

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:44.356
THAT THAT HAS A HIGH LET IN IS

00:23:44.422 --> 00:23:44.923
THIS BY --

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.758
MONITORING WHICH WILL GIVE YOU

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:48.293
THIS PRECISE MEASUREMENT MAKE A

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.262
DISTINCTION FOR THE SOURCES

00:23:50.328 --> 00:23:53.865
BECAUSE WE'RE AN AIR DISTRICT.

00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:54.800
MINOR NOT THAT WE DON'T CARE

00:23:54.866 --> 00:23:56.668
ABOUT THE OVERALL HEALTH BUT IS

00:23:56.735 --> 00:23:57.869
IT COULD GIVE YOU THAT SORT OF

00:23:57.936 --> 00:24:01.106
SPECIFIC INFORMATION SO --

00:24:01.173 --> 00:24:02.474
YOU GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF LED OF

00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:03.909
COURSE THERE'S MANY.

00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:05.777
EXPOSURES TO LEAD MANY DIFFERENT

00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:07.345
EXPOSURES TO LEAD SO SOMETIMES

00:24:07.412 --> 00:24:08.880
BY A MONITORING ACTUALLY

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:11.550
IDENTIFIES A PROBLEM THAT YOU

00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:13.051
NEED TO RESEARCH FURTHER AND

00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:14.953
FIND OUT THOSE SOURCES --

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.621
BUT THERE ARE OTHER KINDS OF

00:24:16.688 --> 00:24:18.790
CHEMICALS WHERE WE HAVE SOME

00:24:18.857 --> 00:24:20.759
PRETTY GOOD MARKERS OF AIR

00:24:20.826 --> 00:24:23.395
EXPOSURE FOR EXAMPLE DIESEL

00:24:23.461 --> 00:24:24.763
EXHAUST SO WE HAVE A STUDY.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:28.333
IN OAKLAND WHERE WE'RE LOOKING

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.335
SEEN COMMUNITIES AND LOOK IN A

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:32.904
PARTICULAR MEASURE OF DIESEL

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:35.006
EXPOSURE OF A CERTAIN COMPOUND A

00:24:35.073 --> 00:24:36.675
NITRO PYRENE COMPOUND.

00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:38.143
AND WHEN YOU SEE THAT IT'S

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.245
REALLY A VERY GOOD MARKER OF

00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:41.546
EXPOSURE TO DIESEL.

00:24:41.613 --> 00:24:43.381
SO IN CONSIDERING WHAT YOU'RE

00:24:43.448 --> 00:24:45.317
GOING TO BUY A MONETARY YOU KNOW

00:24:45.383 --> 00:24:47.686
ONE OF THE KEY CONSIDERATIONS IS.

00:24:47.752 --> 00:24:50.956
WHAT CAN WE USE AS INDICATORS OF

00:24:51.022 --> 00:24:53.058
HEIGHTENED EXPOSURE THAT WILL

00:24:53.124 --> 00:24:55.694
LINK BACK TO THE SOURCE?

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.297
OKAY I'M FORMER FINANCE.

00:24:59.364 --> 00:25:00.031
WE FOR THIS BEFORE WE'RE GONNA

00:25:00.098 --> 00:25:02.234
SAY IT AGAIN WE UNDERSTAND THE

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.802
AMBITION OF SIX SEVENTEEN WE

00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:05.971
ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WAS.

00:25:06.037 --> 00:25:08.573
THE EXTENSION OR THE FLEXIBILITY

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.176
OF OF GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:12.577
REALLY DOESN'T KICK IN UNLESS WE

00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:15.180
HAVE OPTION FUNDS FROM THE YEAR

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:15.814
TWENTY TWENTY ONE BECAUSE WE'RE

00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:16.514
STILL UNDER.

00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:20.919
AB THIRTY TWO AND WHILE THE TOO

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:21.152
MANY --

00:25:21.219 --> 00:25:23.288
MONITORING IS A GREAT IDEA IT

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:24.723
DOESN'T ACTUALLY REDUCE

00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:26.024
GREENHOUSE GAS WHICH IS THE

00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:28.560
NEXUS BETWEEN AB THIRTY TWO A

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:29.895
COINCIDENTALLY WE KNOW THAT IN

00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:31.830
THE LAST OPTION MAY WE DID

00:25:31.897 --> 00:25:37.135
RECEIVE SOME FUNDS. FOR AT THE

00:25:37.202 --> 00:25:37.702
TWENTY TWENTY ONE PERIOD TO

00:25:37.769 --> 00:25:39.905
THOSE FUNDS ARE APPROPRIATELY

00:25:39.971 --> 00:25:41.439
BEING USED FOR A. B. SIXTEEN

00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:42.908
THIS IS SOMETHING SHORT OF A

00:25:42.974 --> 00:25:44.309
BILLION DOLLARS.

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:45.944
JUST PUTTING DOWN A MARKER

00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:47.312
TREATMENT THAT WE WILL BE

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:49.848
LOOKING AT THAT NEXUS BECAUSE AS

00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:51.716
WE GET OTHER PROGRAMS IS SORT OF

00:25:51.783 --> 00:25:53.919
MIX THINGS UP WE HAVE TO BE SURE

00:25:53.985 --> 00:25:55.086
ANY ALEJO.

00:25:55.153 --> 00:25:57.122
I'M EXPECTING A REPORT ON THAT

00:25:57.188 --> 00:26:00.425
THAT WE DON'T EXCEED THOSE --

00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:01.993
THOSE --

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.895
LEGAL LIMITATIONS.

00:26:03.962 --> 00:26:04.195
LA -- DO YOU

00:26:04.262 --> 00:26:05.196
HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD ON THE

00:26:05.263 --> 00:26:07.565
ISSUE NUMBER.

00:26:07.632 --> 00:26:08.767
EIGHT SHAMMAR WITH THE

00:26:08.833 --> 00:26:10.201
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE

00:26:10.268 --> 00:26:12.103
DIDN'T RAISE ISSUES WITH THIS

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.673
PARTICULAR --

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:15.707
PROPOSAL --

00:26:15.774 --> 00:26:17.742
SAID.

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:19.044
FINANCE ANYTHING THAT.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.278
MOVES THE EERIE DEPARTMENT OF

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:22.280
FINANCE WE HEAR AND UNDERSTAND

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:24.249
YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE LEGAL

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:25.984
USE OF THAT TEACHER AFFAN LOOK

00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:27.118
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND

00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:28.787
YOUR STAFF AS WE CONTINUE TO

00:26:28.853 --> 00:26:30.388
DEVELOP THE CAP AND TRADE

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:31.589
EXPENDITURE PLAN.

00:26:31.656 --> 00:26:33.091
THIS IS THE RECOMMENDATION HOLD

00:26:33.158 --> 00:26:34.459
OPEN MEMBERS HAVE SPECIFIC

00:26:34.526 --> 00:26:37.696
QUESTIONS AND I NUMBER.

00:26:37.762 --> 00:26:39.698
EIGHT ALRIGHT LET'S SAID THIS IS

00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:41.099
THE ONLY THING WITH A WE HAVE SO

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:42.400
I'LL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING.

00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:44.035
THIS IS ENVIRONMENT HEALTH

00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:47.872
SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITIES AND AB.

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:50.008
SIX SEVENTEEN TO HOLD OPEN ITEM.

00:26:50.075 --> 00:26:51.509
SEEN NOBODY WILL CLOSE THE

00:26:51.576 --> 00:26:53.078
PUBLIC HEARING THANK YOU VERY

00:26:53.144 --> 00:26:55.246
MUCH KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK --

00:26:55.313 --> 00:26:57.482
CAL RECYCLE THIS IS THE

00:26:57.549 --> 00:26:59.718
DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCE RECYCLING

00:26:59.784 --> 00:27:03.154
AND RECOVERY [inaudible]

00:27:03.221 --> 00:27:13.365
WE HAVE.

00:27:13.431 --> 00:27:14.699
MISTER SMITH FLANK GOOD MORNING

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:16.334
AND WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GIVE US AN

00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:17.836
OVERVIEW COULD YOU SORT OF GIVE

00:27:17.902 --> 00:27:19.504
US A LITTLE BIT OF AN UPDATE ON

00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:25.110
SOME OF THE PROGRAMS --

00:27:25.176 --> 00:27:25.744
SPECIFICALLY ON THAT KEPT

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.979
RECYCLING CAL RECYCLING PROGRAM

00:27:28.046 --> 00:27:29.714
FOR CPAS SPECIFICALLY WE DON'T

00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:32.050
HAVE IT'S NOT ON ONE OF THE

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:52.470
INTEREST IN.

00:27:52.537 --> 00:27:53.271
CHANGING IT LAST YEAR

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:56.674
LEGISLATIVE FULL WE'VE HAD A

00:27:56.741 --> 00:28:01.980
VARIETY OF OF A CONCERN WITH OUR

BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WE'VE HAD.

00:28:06.918 --> 00:28:09.220
TONS OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT HOW

00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:10.188
WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT WE WOULD

00:28:10.255 --> 00:28:11.756
DO NEEDED MINISTRATION.

00:28:11.823 --> 00:28:14.559
WE HAD THREE YEARS OF INTEREST

00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:16.227
GROUPS AND COLLABORATIVE

00:28:16.294 --> 00:28:16.928

BUT NOTHING CAME OUT.

00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:21.132
SO WE HAVE NEW GOVERNOR NOW SO I

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:22.600
JUST WANT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S

00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:24.769
HAPPENING WITH THE PROGRAM IN

THE NOT SO GOOD NEWS AT THE THE

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:31.709
BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING

00:28:31.776 --> 00:28:33.278
PROGRAM IS NOT ACHIEVING.

00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:34.679
ITS 80% --

00:28:34.746 --> 00:28:36.214
RECYCLING RATE GOAL THAT IS IN

00:28:36.281 --> 00:28:37.715
STATUTES SO THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT

00:28:37.782 --> 00:28:39.184
PORTENTS TO US --

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.386
WE AIM TO ACHIEVE ALL THE THE

00:28:41.453 --> 00:28:42.720
GOALS AND AND THE STATUTES THAT

00:28:42.787 --> 00:28:43.788
WE IMPLEMENT --

00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:45.690
THERE'S A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR

00:28:45.757 --> 00:28:47.492
THAT -- YOU

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:50.829
MENTIONED ONE THAT BEEN VERY

00:28:50.895 --> 00:28:51.996
SIGNIFICAN IN A PRESS

00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:53.698
SIGNIFICANTLY LATELY WHICH IS

00:28:53.765 --> 00:28:54.499
THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:56.401
CLOSURES OF RECYCLING CENTERS --

00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:57.302
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THAT

00:28:57.368 --> 00:28:59.604
CONTRIBUTE SOME TO THE REDUCE

00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:01.539
RECYCLING RATE.

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:03.141
IT'S DIFFICULT TO TEASE OUT --

00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:04.876
IN THIS VERY COMPLICATED PROGRAM

00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:08.012
AS YOU ARE AWARE WHAT IS DRIVING.

00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:09.414
WHAT CHANGE THAT WE SEE IN THE

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:10.448
PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE OVER THE

00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:11.316

00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:14.352
TO NEW LEGISLATION IN NUMBER OF

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:15.253
ANTI FRAUD MEASURES WHICH WE

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:15.987
BELIEVE?

00:29:16.054 --> 00:29:16.988
HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AT

00:29:17.055 --> 00:29:18.089
REDUCING FRAUD IN THE PROGRAM

00:29:18.156 --> 00:29:19.090
AND COULD HAVE.

00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:20.391
CONTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCED

00:29:20.458 --> 00:29:21.893
RECYCLING RIGHT THAT WE SEE IN

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.961
TERMS OF REDUCING --

00:29:23.027 --> 00:29:23.995
WHAT WOULD'VE BEEN FRAUDULENT

00:29:24.062 --> 00:29:25.630
REDEMPTIONS IN THE STATE OF

00:29:25.697 --> 00:29:28.066
CALIFORNIA [inaudible]

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:34.506
THERE'S A GOD.

00:29:34.572 --> 00:29:36.641
ACCEPTING CERTAIN MATERIALS AS

00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:39.244
FREELY AS THEY ONCE DID.

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.678
THAT ARE CONSUMED A LOT OF OUR

00:29:40.745 --> 00:29:42.113
EXPORT MATERIALS ARE NO LONGER

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.848
TAKING NOTES SO THAT'S HAD.

00:29:43.915 --> 00:29:46.251
A MARGINAL IMPACT IF NOT MORE ON

00:29:46.317 --> 00:29:47.652
THE PROFITABILITY OF SOME THE

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:49.187
RECYCLING CENTERS IN OUR ABILITY

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:50.822
TO EXPORT THIS MATERIAL IN

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:52.423
ADDITION PRIMARILY WE'VE SEEN.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.058
ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT PROFIT

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:55.627
DRIVERS OF THESE RECYCLING

00:29:55.693 --> 00:29:57.328

CONTAINERS AND ALUMINUM AS WELL

00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:07.539
AS THE SCRAP VALUE FOR LIMON HAS

00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:11.276
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED --

00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:11.576
GLOBALLY --

00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:14.779

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:16.748
DYNAMIC.

00:30:16.814 --> 00:30:17.815
SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:30:17.882 --> 00:30:20.752
CHALLENGES ND AS YOU MENTIONED

00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:21.386

HOPEFULLY AND THAT SOMETHING

00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:40.672
THAT MIGHT SHED SOME LIGHT ON

00:30:40.738 --> 00:30:41.406
THE DIRECTION WE'RE GOING WITH

00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:42.440

00:31:22.814 --> 00:31:23.748
FREE WORK SIR LOOK I I THINK

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:24.482
THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAD

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:25.483
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.285
AND WITHIN THE RECYCLING PROGRAM

00:31:27.352 --> 00:31:29.454
VERTICALLY IN RURAL AREAS SOME

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.223
THAT WE SEEN IN FOREIGN MARKETS.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.359
HOUSE IMPACTED US SO I THINK

00:31:34.425 --> 00:31:36.594
WE'RE NOW WE'RE RUNNING ON YEARS

00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:37.795
THREE WITH --

00:31:37.862 --> 00:31:41.332
IN RURAL CALIFORNIA LITTLE TO

00:31:41.399 --> 00:31:43.167
ZERO RECYCLING CENTER AVAILABLE.

00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:46.938
ON AND SO I I WOULD CATCH IT IS

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:49.574
I THINK THE THE FULL OF THE

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:51.709
FOREIGN INFLUENCES OF WHAT WE'VE

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:53.211
SEEN AS OF LATE.

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:54.779
AND ONLY EXASPERATED PROBLEM

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:55.880
WE'VE HAD.

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:58.249
I'M HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN

00:31:58.316 --> 00:32:00.051
GENERAL [inaudible]

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:01.452
N..

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:03.755
I GUESS WHERE THE FRUSTRATION IS

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:05.490
IN SMITH I AM NOT TRYING TO KEEP

00:32:05.556 --> 00:32:06.724
THE DOG AS WE HAVE BEEN IN MANY

00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:07.892
MANY MEETINGS TOGETHER AND I AM

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:09.727
GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PATIENCE IN

00:32:09.794 --> 00:32:11.029
THESE MEETINGS AS WELL AS YOU

00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:11.229
WANT.

00:32:11.296 --> 00:32:12.430
TO BUT OPINION YOUR AYE --

00:32:12.497 --> 00:32:13.998
BUT LOOK I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE

00:32:14.065 --> 00:32:16.334
IS WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THAT

00:32:16.401 --> 00:32:17.335
THERE ARE CHALLENGES.

00:32:17.402 --> 00:32:19.070
IN THE LONGER WE WAIT THE WORSE

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:21.439
IT GETS IN NOW WORD STILLNESS

00:32:21.506 --> 00:32:23.007
WANTING THIS ONE GETS BIGGER --

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:25.176
AND THERE'S NO END IN SIGHT SO

00:32:25.243 --> 00:32:28.246
WE HAVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION I

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:29.280
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:30.948
WHERE WE GONNA GO FROM HERE

00:32:31.015 --> 00:32:33.051
BECAUSE ESPECIALLY IN RURAL --

00:32:33.117 --> 00:32:34.252
WE'VE --

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:37.655
ELEVEN WITH THIS CHALLENGE WE

00:32:37.722 --> 00:32:39.590
SAW THE HUGE LUMP WITH CHINA.

00:32:39.657 --> 00:32:40.825
ENOUGH I'D THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

00:32:40.892 --> 00:32:42.160
ACCURATE --

00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:43.194
THEN I I GUESS I CAN JUST --

00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:44.562
WITH THE OBVIOUS WE DO NOT HAVE

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:45.396
A B. C. P. BEFORE THE COMMITTEE

00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:46.764
TODAY ON THE BEVERAGE TEN

00:32:46.831 --> 00:32:48.266
RECYCLING PROGRAM BUT I CAN TELL

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:48.966
YOU.

00:32:49.033 --> 00:32:50.468
THAT THE DYNAMIC WHICH YOU REYES

00:32:50.535 --> 00:32:51.769
WHICH IS --

00:32:51.836 --> 00:32:53.304
WHATEVER THE HARDSHIPS THAT ARE

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:55.006
FACING THE RECYCLING CENTERS THE

00:32:55.073 --> 00:32:56.841
LOW VOLUME IN THE REALISTICALLY

00:32:56.908 --> 00:32:57.942
WITH THE LOW VOLUME SITES --

00:32:58.009 --> 00:32:59.744
FACE THAT THE WORST BECAUSE A

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:01.112
LOT OF THAT WITH THE WAY THE

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:02.113
STATUTE IS IMPLEMENTED IS THAT

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.149
WE WE PAY RECYCLING CENTERS.

00:33:05.216 --> 00:33:06.884
ON A STATEWIDE AVERAGE.

00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:08.252
HONOR IT RIGHT AND SO --

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:09.554
I GUESS I CAN SURE DO THAT THAT

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.289
DYNAMIC IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE

00:33:11.356 --> 00:33:12.657
CURRENTLY DISCUSSING AN AWARE OF

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:16.361
AND IT'S STILL A PRIORITY FOR US

00:33:16.427 --> 00:33:18.463
SO THIS ISN'T IT IS NOT --

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:20.098
NOT FORGOTTEN NOT AT ALL BEING

00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:20.398
CRUNCHY --

00:33:20.465 --> 00:33:22.700
BUT IT'S BEEN A PRIORITY

00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:24.769
[inaudible] FOR THREE YEARS AND

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:26.704
WE STILL DON'T HAVE ANY

00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:28.973
SOLUTIONS TO DATE THERE BEEN A

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.143
VARIETY OF ON PROPOSALS THAT

LEGISLATURE --

00:33:33.911 --> 00:33:36.581
A AND THOSE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE --

00:33:36.647 --> 00:33:38.750
TO GO ANYWHERE CANDIDLY THIS IS

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:40.385
GOING TO HAVE TO BE AN ISSUE

00:33:40.451 --> 00:33:41.486
THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION'S GONNA

00:33:41.552 --> 00:33:44.389
I'M HAVE TO TACKLE AND BECAUSE

IN COUNTRY TRYING TO KICK THAT

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:51.195
DEAD DOG RIGHT BUT A LITTLE

00:33:51.262 --> 00:33:53.598
EASIER AGAIN IT IS GROUNDHOG DAY.

00:33:53.664 --> 00:33:55.867
MESSAGE RECEIVED CENTER.

00:33:55.933 --> 00:34:01.806

00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:18.055
IN.

00:34:18.122 --> 00:34:19.757
A LOT OF THAT.

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:21.359
IS PLASTICS COME.

00:34:21.426 --> 00:34:23.461
IN PLASTICS THAT AREN'T BEING

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:25.029
RECYCLED --

00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:25.630
OR THAT.

00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:29.634
DEGRADE ASSESS AND END UP IN

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.836
THESE MICROCHIPS.

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:33.337
THE CONCLUSION OF THAT HEARING

00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:35.173
YESTERDAY THERE'S NO WAY TO

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:36.774
RECYCLE OUR WAY OUT OF THIS

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:37.542
PROBLEM.

00:34:37.608 --> 00:34:40.812
WE GOTTA GO TO SOURCE POLLUTION.

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:42.914
IN I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:43.481
SOMETHING YOU'RE DEPARTMENT

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:46.050
LOOKS AT SOME.

00:34:46.117 --> 00:34:47.518
BUT IF SO.

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:50.154
RE DOING UPSTREAM TO ENCOURAGE

00:34:50.221 --> 00:34:54.125
MANUFACTURERS [inaudible] TO TO

00:34:54.192 --> 00:34:55.993
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.697
THEY'RE PRODUCING AND TO LOOK AT

00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:01.599
UP SENATOR.

00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:02.700
WE HAVE VERY LIMITED EXISTING

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:05.169
STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO TAKE THAT

00:35:05.236 --> 00:35:06.103
TYPE OF ACTION --

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.605
WE HAVE A COUPLE PROGRAMS THAT

00:35:07.672 --> 00:35:09.207
DO INVOLVE SOURCE REDUCTION AS

00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:10.508
PART OF IMPLEMENTATION RIGID

00:35:10.575 --> 00:35:11.909
PLASTIC PACKAGING PROGRAM WOULD

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:12.810
BE ONE OF THOSE AND WE ARE

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:14.312
IMPLEMENTING THAT PROGRAM BUT IT

00:35:14.378 --> 00:35:16.481
IS FAIRLY LIMITED IN SCOPE --

00:35:16.547 --> 00:35:18.349

THAT.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.255
WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECYCLE

00:35:24.322 --> 00:35:26.123
OURSELVES OUT OF THIS SITUATION

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.858
I THINK THAT'S AN ACCURATE

00:35:26.924 --> 00:35:28.125
STATEMENT I THINK WE HAVE TO

00:35:28.192 --> 00:35:30.127
LOOK AT REDUCING THE AMOUNT.

00:35:30.194 --> 00:35:34.098
OF SINGLE USE PACKAGING THAT --

00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:35.733
CONSUMED IN OUR ECONOMY AND I

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.767
THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE A

00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:38.302
PRIORITIES WE MOVE.

00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:39.170

IN SORT OF THE LACK OF CAPACITY

00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:57.181
IN THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW IS THAT.

RESURRECT THE MARKET DEVELOPMENT

00:37:18.469 --> 00:37:20.972
ZONES TO LOOKING AT SORT OF NEW

00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:22.607
OPPORTUNITIES --

00:37:22.673 --> 00:37:25.776

AND I I I DON'T KNOW.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:36.754
THERE'S NOT A SPECIFIC

00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:38.623
RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW BETWEEN

00:37:38.689 --> 00:37:40.157
THAT PROGRAM AND THE BEVERAGE

00:37:40.224 --> 00:37:43.194
TEN RECYCLING PROGRAM.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.428
WELL THERE I MEAN THERE IS A

00:37:44.495 --> 00:37:46.297
RELATIONSHIP AND THAT THERE'S NO

00:37:46.364 --> 00:37:48.199

SENSE TO JUST USE NEAR TERM

00:37:52.737 --> 00:37:55.139
STRATEGIC PLAN FOR IT FOR THE

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:57.375
YEAR GOT IT SO WELL I SORRY FOR

00:37:57.441 --> 00:37:58.609

THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS A

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.444
LOT OF OUR GRAMS I PREACH.

00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:02.013
I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:04.281
SAYING NOW --

00:38:04.348 --> 00:38:05.116
THE REALLY CRITICAL IMPORTANT

00:38:05.182 --> 00:38:06.317
POINT SO --

00:38:06.384 --> 00:38:08.019
I THINK THE STATE HAS A GOOD

00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:08.753
TRACK RECORD WHEN WE SET OUR

00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:10.688
MIND TO IT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:12.189
INCREASE DOMESTIC RECYCLING FOR

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:13.824
THEIR MATERIAL THAT ONE POINT IN

00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:14.125
TIME.

00:38:14.191 --> 00:38:16.093
WE USED TO EXPORT --

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.595
98% OF PT WHICH IS OF COURSE

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:18.963
THAT THIS THIS WATER BOTTOM

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.431
UNTIL RIGHT HERE RIGHT.

00:38:20.498 --> 00:38:21.799
THROUGH A A PUBLIC PRIVATE

00:38:21.866 --> 00:38:23.434
PARTNERSHIP TO THE PLASTIC MARK

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:24.502
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM NOT THE ARMS

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:25.569
YOU BUT TO A PROGRAM WITHIN THE

00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:26.704
BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING

00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:28.372
PROGRAM WE INVESTED IN.

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:29.840
PT RECLAIMING CAPACITY HERE IN

00:38:29.907 --> 00:38:33.344
CALIFORNIA WE NOW CONSUME 75% OF

00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:34.478
THE PT AND READ --

00:38:34.545 --> 00:38:35.913
PROCESS IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.281
AND EXPORT --

00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:39.917
LESS THAN 25% OF OF THIS --

00:38:39.984 --> 00:38:41.185
UBIQUITOUS MATERIAL HERE SO I

00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:41.952
THINK THERE'S A TRACK RECORD FOR

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:43.387
THAT AND WE ARE LOOKING VERY

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:45.756
CLOSELY AT THE ENTIRE MATERIAL

00:38:45.823 --> 00:38:46.657
STREAMING TRYING TO DO AN

00:38:46.724 --> 00:38:48.125
ANALYSIS OF WHAT ARE THE

00:38:48.192 --> 00:38:49.126
MATERIALS THAT ARE RIGHT. FOR

00:38:49.193 --> 00:38:50.628
CALIFORNIA TO REINVEST IN

00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:52.196
REMANUFACTURING HERE IN

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:53.664
CALIFORNIA.

00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:56.333
NUMBER OF REASONS --

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.936
NOT ALL MATERIAL TYPES MY SO

00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:01.839
MATERIAL TYPES THAT WE AND IT'S

00:39:01.906 --> 00:39:02.640
FOR RE INVESTING IN

00:39:02.707 --> 00:39:04.408
REMANUFACTURING CALIFORNIA BRING

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:04.642
JOBS --

00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:05.843
WHICH MATERIAL TYPES ARE

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.111
PROBABLY MORE PROBLEMATIC WE

00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:08.479
WANT TO LOOK AT REDUCING OUT OF

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:09.580
THE STREAM SO WE ARE CONDUCTING

00:39:09.647 --> 00:39:11.048
THOSE ANALYSES CHARACTERIZATION

00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:12.983
PROCESS IS UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:13.718
THAT'S CONTEMPLATED IN THIS

00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:14.452
YEAR'S BUDGET.

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:15.886
EXTENDING UPON THAT THAT'S

00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:17.888
ALREADY UNDER WAY IT IS IT IN

00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:19.724
THE IN THE CAPACITY OF ITS --

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.159
AN ONGOING RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

00:39:22.226 --> 00:39:23.260
DEPARTMENT TO BE.

00:39:23.327 --> 00:39:23.794
CONDUCTING THESE TYPES OF

00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:25.696
ANALYSES NOT.

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:27.231
SPECIFIC TO ANY PROPOSAL KILLER

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:29.233
REGULATION IRAQ IT JUST SORT OF

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.768
A GENERAL WILL READ THAT'S GOOD

00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:31.569
BECAUSE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:33.270
THAT TOO SO I I APPRECIATE THAT

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:35.106
WORKED AT BEING DONE IN ADVANCE

00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:36.640
BECAUSE FRANKLY THE LG TIME.

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:37.742
CAN BE SIGNIFICANT EVEN IF WE

SORT OF NON CHEMICAL SOLUTION

00:52:31.147 --> 00:52:32.916
SOUND HIPPY DIPPY BUT IN FACT

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:33.884
THEY'VE BEEN PROVEN IN VENTURA

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.385
COUNTY TO BE PRETTY EFFECTIVE WE

00:52:35.452 --> 00:52:36.786
JUST FINISHED A CASE STUDY OUT

00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:37.420
THERE SO.

00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:39.489
I GUESS QUESTION ON LOCAL

DISCRETION TO MOVE --

00:52:40.957 --> 00:52:42.292
AND THEN WHAT KIND OF

00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:43.527
ALTERNATIVES ARE YOU LOOKING AT

00:52:43.593 --> 00:52:44.494
ON THE IBM SAID.

00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:46.096

SO DURING THIS TIME THEIR PERIOD

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.647
THERE WILL BE NO EXPANSION OF

00:53:03.713 --> 00:53:05.081
SECOND GENERATION ANTICOAGULANTS

00:53:05.148 --> 00:53:07.150

PRODUCED SINCE 200-022-00020 AND

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:17.814
YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE THIS AND

00:56:19.142 --> 00:56:21.010
THAT PAINTS A BRIGHTER PICTURE

00:56:21.077 --> 00:56:22.078
IN THIS CASE.

00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:23.613

RECEIVED THIS INFORMATION A FEW

00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:43.900
DAYS AGO TO DO AN ANALYSIS OF

00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:46.369
WHAT'S CAUSING THIS BUT GIVEN

00:56:46.436 --> 00:56:48.104
THAT -- THAT

00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:49.572
THAT FUND BALANCE IS DECLINING

00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:50.874
WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO HOLD

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:53.042
THESE ITEMS OPEN AS RECOMMENDED

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:55.011
BY STAFF INTEL WE CAN LOOK INTO

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:56.246
IT MORE.

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:03.887
WITHIN THE 325% WILL RUN.

00:57:03.953 --> 00:57:05.288

AT THE TIME OF GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:57:07.857 --> 00:57:09.359

00:57:11.394 --> 00:57:13.129
BEEN ABLE TO RECONCILE THE FIND

00:57:13.196 --> 00:57:14.664
AND PROVIDE YOUR STAFF AND THE

00:57:14.731 --> 00:57:16.833
LA OUT WITH AN UPDATED FINE

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:18.434

MISTER CHAIR IN.

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:23.373
AGAIN MAYBE I'M DRIFTING BACK

00:57:23.439 --> 00:57:25.375
INTO THE POLICY NO PUN INTENDED

00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:27.777
I'M CONCERNED ON THE SCHOOL SITE.

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:29.445
MONITORING.

00:57:29.512 --> 00:57:31.181
THE HEALTHY SCHOOLS LOOKS A LOT

00:57:31.247 --> 00:57:34.918
AT PRACTICES ON SCHOOLS GROUNDS

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:35.985
TURF IT CETERA.

00:57:36.052 --> 00:57:37.353
BUT THE OTHER BIG RISK IN RURAL

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.290
AREAS IS DRIFT OF PESTICIDE FROM

00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:41.724
AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS.

00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:43.426
IN MY DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR

00:57:43.493 --> 00:57:46.663
THERE'S PARENTS AND TEACHERS

00:57:46.729 --> 00:57:48.097
LOOKING AT CHLORPYRIFOS.

00:57:48.164 --> 00:57:50.266
WOULD THAT BE WITHIN THE SCOPE

00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:53.570
OF THE SAFES.

00:57:53.636 --> 00:57:55.238
BEYOND --

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:57.273
WHAT'S CONTEMPLATED IN THE SAFE

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:57.874
SCHOOLS.

00:57:57.941 --> 00:57:59.909
EFFORTS.

00:57:59.976 --> 00:58:01.377
IT THAT WOULD BE ON BEYOND THE

00:58:01.444 --> 00:58:02.478
HEALTHY SCHOOLS ACTING WAT'S

00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:03.913
CONTEMPLATED IN THIS PARTICULAR

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.582
BILL HOWEVER WE DID PASS

00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:07.417
REGULATION LAST YEAR THAT DEALS

00:58:07.483 --> 00:58:08.852
WITH PESTICIDE USE AROUND

00:58:08.918 --> 00:58:09.686
SCHOOLS.

00:58:09.752 --> 00:58:11.588
AND IT HAS PROVIDED THAT --

00:58:11.654 --> 00:58:14.824
WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF SCHOOLS --

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:16.559
BETWEEN SIX THE MORNING IS A

YOU PESTICIDES THAT ARE SUBJECT

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:21.497
TO DRIFT.

00:58:21.564 --> 00:58:23.199
SO THAT AT THAT WE THINK IS

00:58:23.266 --> 00:58:24.701
TAKING CARE OF A LOT OF THOSE

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:26.736
CONCERNS --

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:28.304

01:26:14.068 --> 01:26:15.703
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET YES THAT IS

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:22.644
CORRECT.

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:23.978
WE'RE PAYING BACK ONE LINE WERE

01:26:24.045 --> 01:26:25.680
ASKING FOR AN EXTENSION OF

01:26:25.747 --> 01:26:27.215
ANOTHER.

01:26:27.282 --> 01:26:28.316
ONE RIGHT WHEN WE WERE ASKING

01:26:28.383 --> 01:26:29.617
FOR DIFFERENT EDITION ALL

01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:30.852
ADDITIONAL MONEY CORRECT THIS

01:26:30.919 --> 01:26:33.555
AND THAT AND THIS SPEAKS.

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:35.723
TO THE THE NATURE OF THE THE

01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:39.394
PROJECT ITSELF AND WE WANT TO

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.462
ACKNOWLEDGE THE HEALTH AND

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:43.965
SAFETY WE WANT TO ACCELERATE.

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:46.067
WITH THE ANTICIPATION AT SOME

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:48.803
POINT EXIDE WILL BEGIN.

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:51.139
REIMBURSING THE STATE.

01:26:51.205 --> 01:26:54.008
OF THE LEAD ACID BATTERY ALL.

01:26:54.075 --> 01:26:55.977
IN AND OF ITSELF.

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:58.413
IS NOT IN A POSITION TO BE DOING

01:26:58.479 --> 01:27:00.582
THESE LARGE CHUNKS --

01:27:00.648 --> 01:27:01.683
WE COULD.

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:03.084
I MEAN THAT IS CERTAINLY

01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:06.588
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DISCUSS IF.

01:27:06.654 --> 01:27:08.957
IF THE NEW.

01:27:09.023 --> 01:27:11.326
IF THERE IS A DESIRE TO DO THE

01:27:11.392 --> 01:27:13.561
DIRECT EXPENDITURE JUST OUT OF

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:14.862
THE LEAD ACID BATTERY FUND.

01:27:14.929 --> 01:27:17.198
BUT THEN THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:18.666
SLOW DOWN.

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:21.436
THE THE CLEAN UP EFFORTS AND AT

01:27:21.502 --> 01:27:23.271
THIS POINT I THINK WE WANTED TO

01:27:23.338 --> 01:27:26.240
MAINTAIN THE THE KEEP THE

01:27:26.307 --> 01:27:28.276
MOMENTUM GOING.

01:27:28.343 --> 01:27:30.078
FROM THE FIRST LOAN AND THEN

01:27:30.144 --> 01:27:33.781
THIS ONE WOULD.

01:27:33.848 --> 01:27:35.049
PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL

01:27:35.116 --> 01:27:37.652
FLEXIBILITY IS THAT IS THAT IT.

01:27:37.719 --> 01:27:41.689
IS A FUN I I THINK BECAUSE THAT

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:43.224
WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:45.493
WAS THE FUN THAT WE TRANSFER THE

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.395
FIRST BIG MONEY AND YEAH.

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:49.030
SO WHILE WE'RE AT IT WHAT'S THE

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:51.599
UPDATE ON THE EXCITED BANKRUPTCY.

01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:52.967
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE THE SITE IS

01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:55.136
IN BANKRUPTCY THEY SHOULD HAVE A

01:27:55.203 --> 01:27:57.805
PLAN OF REORGANIZATION I KNOW WE

01:27:57.872 --> 01:28:01.142
GOT ASSURANCES FROM THE MOTHER.

01:28:01.209 --> 01:28:02.510
EXCITED THAT THEY WOULD MAKE

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:05.113
GOOD ON ANYTHING SHORTFALL WHAT

01:28:05.179 --> 01:28:07.315
IS THE THE DEBTOR IN POSSESSION

01:28:07.382 --> 01:28:11.152
WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THAT.

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:12.553
SO THEY THEY CAME OUT OF

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.322
BANKRUPTCY THEY REORGANIZED AND

01:28:14.389 --> 01:28:16.224
THEY ARE ON THEY ARE WORKING

01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:19.093
WITH US ON DOING THE ON SITE --

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.529
CORRECTIVE ACTION INVESTIGATIONS

01:28:21.596 --> 01:28:24.032
THEY'RE ALSO WORKING ON CLOSING

01:28:24.098 --> 01:28:28.269
THE FACILITY. FOR IT.

01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:30.405
I ATE THE SOUL.

01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:34.509
THERE IS NO BANKRUPTCY ON ON THE

01:28:34.575 --> 01:28:36.144
HORIZON BUT THAT.

01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:38.112
THAT IS JUST A CONCERN BECAUSE

01:28:38.179 --> 01:28:40.048
THEY'VE DONE IT BEFORE SO THE

01:28:40.114 --> 01:28:41.849
PROCESS THAT THAT THAT WE'RE

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:43.384
FRONTING THE MONEY FOR THE CLEAN

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:45.153
UP THEY'RE GOING TO REPAY THIS

01:28:45.219 --> 01:28:47.321
LOAN THAT WOULD JUST BE IN IN

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:49.757
THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:51.859
FOR ANY LARGE.

01:28:51.926 --> 01:28:54.062
A CORPORATION RIGHT SO WE'VE WE

01:28:54.128 --> 01:28:55.296
SUBMIT.

01:28:55.363 --> 01:28:57.131
BILLS TO THEM.

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:59.067
ON THE ON THE STATUS OF THE THE

01:28:59.133 --> 01:29:02.070
CLEAN UP --

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:04.172
ON THE ON THE CLOSURE OF THE

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:05.540
FACILITY WE DO SEND THEM

01:29:05.606 --> 01:29:07.608
INVOICES FOR THE ARE OVERSIGHT

01:29:07.675 --> 01:29:09.377
AND THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING

01:29:09.444 --> 01:29:11.379
IN IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE

01:29:11.446 --> 01:29:12.814
DOING THAT WORK.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.982
ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE THERE IS

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:16.384
A PROCESS THE REASON THE STATE

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:18.653
STEPPED IN IS THAT WE FOUND THIS

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.388
IS A LARGE PROBLEM.

01:29:20.455 --> 01:29:21.923
IN FACT A LOT OF FAMILIES.

01:29:21.989 --> 01:29:25.827
AND WE STARTED THE WORK BECAUSE

01:29:25.893 --> 01:29:27.995
WORKING WITH EXCITED WILL TAKE.

01:29:28.062 --> 01:29:29.097
TEN YEARS HAD PASSED A TO GET

01:29:29.163 --> 01:29:30.364
THERE THEY HAVE SUBMITTED A

01:29:30.431 --> 01:29:32.233
REQUEST FACILITY INVESTIGATION

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:33.101
REPORT.

01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:35.136
ODD THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:36.437
OF REVIEWING AND AND RIVER A

01:29:36.504 --> 01:29:38.039
RESPONDING TO THEM BUT THE

01:29:38.106 --> 01:29:39.040
COMMENTS.

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:40.475
AFTER THAT THEY'LL PREPARE A

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:42.310
CORRECTIVE MEASURES STUDY WILL

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:44.679
SELECT THE REMEDY AND THEN THEY

01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:46.714
WILL GET TO DOING IT IN THIS%

01:29:46.781 --> 01:29:47.949
CASE WE HAVE STARTED

01:29:48.015 --> 01:29:49.484
IMPLEMENTING THE REMEDY

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:53.321
SO WE EXPECT THEM TO PICK IT UP

01:29:53.387 --> 01:29:55.656
BUT THAT IS WAYS AWAY I GUESS I

01:29:55.723 --> 01:29:57.658
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR I A

01:29:57.725 --> 01:29:59.193
C. THE RESIDENTIAL SPOTS THE

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:00.728
ACTUAL CLEAN UP IN THE

01:30:00.795 --> 01:30:02.063
DECOMMISSIONING OF THE FACILITY

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:03.030
THAT THEY HAVE.

01:30:03.097 --> 01:30:03.998
I GUESS MAYBE THAT'S THE BETTER

01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:06.367
QUESTION IS THERE THEY'RE TAKING

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:07.702
APART [inaudible]

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:08.770
THE PLACE.

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:10.638
THE FACILITY AND DOING SOME

01:30:10.705 --> 01:30:12.340
REMEDIATION AND SOME CLEAN UP

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:16.144
THERE TO HAVE A UPDATE ON THAT --

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:18.079
BECAUSE THAT'S A SOURCE OF X.

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:20.381
BANDED CONTAMINATION RIGHT IF

01:30:20.448 --> 01:30:21.482
IT'S THERE AND IT'S SPREADING.

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:22.984
ASSEMBLY THAT WAS THE SCIENCE

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:25.219
BEHIND IT RIGHT SO THE FACILITY

01:30:25.286 --> 01:30:26.387
ITSELF --

01:30:26.454 --> 01:30:27.722
WHEN THE PERMIT WAS DENIED THE

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:29.624
SUBMITTED A CLOSURE PLAN WHICH

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:30.725
WAS APPROVED WITH THE

ACCOMPANYING ENVIRONMENTAL

01:30:32.727 --> 01:30:33.995
IMPACT PORTS ARE?

01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:35.997
CLOSURE IMPLEMENTATION BEGAN

NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:42.136
IT'S ARE THE PHASE ONE IS

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:43.671
DECONTAMINATION I DEMOLITION AND

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:44.772
DISPOSAL.

01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:46.174
OF ALL OF THE ABOVE GROUND

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:47.909
STRUCTURES THAT WERE USED IN

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:49.777
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT OUR

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:51.345
ON SITE.

01:30:51.412 --> 01:30:54.382
ARE BEING I TAKE IN I DOWN THE

01:30:54.448 --> 01:30:56.184
THERE IS --

EXCITE IS DOING THIS WITH THEIR

01:31:13.434 --> 01:31:15.069
OPERATIONS.

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:17.405
THERE IS A FINAL SURE CERN'S BUT

01:31:17.471 --> 01:31:19.874
EXCITE IS DOING THE

01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:22.276
IMPLEMENTATION OF CLOSURE OUT OF

THEY HAVE REIMBURSED FOR THAT

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:33.187
MONEY SO WE HAVE --

01:31:33.254 --> 01:31:35.056
THAT IN PROGRESS.

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:39.026
ASIDE FROM THE FACILITY ITSELF.

01:31:39.093 --> 01:31:42.263
THERE IS THE INVESTIGATION OF

NEIGHBORING INDUSTRIAL AREA.

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:11.392
THEY HAVE INVEST.

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:14.362
A SAMPLED ABOUT FIFTY PROPERTIES

01:32:14.428 --> 01:32:15.529
FIFTY TWO PROPERTIES THAT ARE

INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES ARE AND

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:19.901
THERE ARE SOME PROPERTIES THAT

01:32:19.967 --> 01:32:22.737
REQUIRED SECOND SET OF SAMPLING.

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:24.572
THOSE RESULTS ARE BEING REVIEWED --

01:32:24.639 --> 01:32:26.240
THERE IS A WORK PLAN --

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:27.775
THAT IS BEING REVIEWED AND THERE

01:32:27.842 --> 01:32:30.311
WOULD THAT INDUSTRIAL ROUTE --

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:32.413
CORRECTIVE ACTION WILL ALSO GO

WHEN THEY GOT THE SITE IT WAS

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:14.956
PLENTY CONTAMINATION.

01:33:15.022 --> 01:33:16.757
IN PEOPLE'S HOUSES WERE PLENTY

THE OPERATOR SO I'D.

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:21.963

01:33:34.809 --> 01:33:37.011
EXISTENCE SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY

01:33:37.078 --> 01:33:40.314
TWO EXIDE ACQUIRED IT. TWO

01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:41.048
THOUSAND THE SECOND QUESTION

01:33:41.115 --> 01:33:41.415
THAT THE LA --

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:45.052
HAD FEWER WE GOT TO THE FIRST

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:45.353
[inaudible]

01:33:45.419 --> 01:33:48.022
ONE YES.

01:33:48.089 --> 01:33:49.056
I'LL GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE

01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:50.591
ANSWER TO THAT AND I I WANT TO I

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:52.326
WANT TO JUST AND ACKNOWLEDGE

01:33:52.393 --> 01:33:53.694
THAT WE'VE --

01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:55.196
STRUGGLED WITH --

01:33:55.262 --> 01:33:57.098
COMING UP WITH A NUMBER ON THIS

01:33:57.164 --> 01:33:58.332
NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE

01:33:58.399 --> 01:34:00.034
TRANSPARENT BUT BECAUSE THERE

01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:01.369
ARE SO MANY CONTINGENCIES

01:34:01.435 --> 01:34:04.071
RELATED TO IDENTIFYING AND THE

01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:06.307
TOTAL COST OF CLEAN UP.

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:08.843
THAT RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES BUT

01:34:08.909 --> 01:34:10.177
I'M GOING TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A

01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:11.479
RESPONSE THAT'S BASED ON THE

01:34:11.545 --> 01:34:13.381
INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO DATE

01:34:13.447 --> 01:34:14.815
AND I LOOK FORWARD.

01:34:14.882 --> 01:34:15.850
TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE

01:34:15.916 --> 01:34:17.885
UPDATES TO THIS INFORMATION AS

01:34:17.952 --> 01:34:20.921
WE CONTINUE TO CLEAN UP AND

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:21.856
GATHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

01:34:21.922 --> 01:34:23.557
SO ASSUMING THE ADDITIONAL

01:34:23.624 --> 01:34:24.792
SEVENTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:26.193
IS APPROVED --

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:28.729
AS AND MISS PATEL INDICATED HAVE

01:34:28.796 --> 01:34:30.865
ESTIMATED THAT ALL PARCELS OUT.

01:34:30.931 --> 01:34:31.699
MORE ABOVE THREE HUNDRED AND

01:34:31.766 --> 01:34:34.668
THIRTY THREE PER BE CLEANED UP

01:34:34.735 --> 01:34:36.337
USING THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:38.239
SIX POINT SIX MILLION AND THE

01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:40.641
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION PROPOSED.

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:42.343
THE APPROXIMATELY OF THERE'S

01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:43.811
APPROXIMATELY FORTY FOUR HUNDRED

01:34:43.878 --> 01:34:44.845
ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES THAT HAVE

01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:46.313
BEEN SAMPLED TO DATE.

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.815
THAT HAVE REPRESENTATIVE SOIL

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:50.251
LEAD CONCENTRATIONS OF BELOW

01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:51.152
THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE

01:34:51.218 --> 01:34:52.686
PARTS PER MILLION BUT ABOVE DTS

01:34:52.753 --> 01:34:55.056
SEES. EIGHTY PARTSPER MILLION

01:34:55.122 --> 01:34:56.690
TARGET CLEANUP GOAL.

01:34:56.757 --> 01:34:58.826
AND THE COST TO CLEAN UP THIS

01:34:58.893 --> 01:35:01.162
REMAINING FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:01.762
FOUR HUNDRED PARCELS ARE

01:35:01.829 --> 01:35:03.431
DIFFICULT TO FORECAST BECAUSE

01:35:03.497 --> 01:35:04.932
THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION

01:35:04.999 --> 01:35:06.834
IS UNKNOWN --

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:08.969
AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS ME

01:35:09.036 --> 01:35:10.738
CONTINUE TO INFLATE --

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:13.174
AS THEY HAVE OVER THE PAST

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.843
COUPLE OF YEARS COULD PUT ME

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:18.679
INTO IS WE ATE WE HERE'S THE

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:19.914
EXCITES SITE IS HERE YES YOU'VE

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:22.550
DONE THE CLOSEST PROPERTIES NOW

01:35:22.616 --> 01:35:25.186
YOU'RE OUT I'M A MILE.

01:35:25.252 --> 01:35:26.887
POINT.

01:35:26.954 --> 01:35:28.556
SEVEN COMMON SENSE TELLS ME IT'S

01:35:28.622 --> 01:35:29.924
MAY BE WRONG BUT COMMON SENSE

01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:31.625
TELLS ME THAT THE ONE RIGHT

01:35:31.692 --> 01:35:32.893
ACROSS THE STREET FROM EXCITED

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.295
IS COULD BE MORE CONTAMINATED

01:35:34.361 --> 01:35:36.263
THAN THE LAST HOUSE THAT MAY GO

01:35:36.330 --> 01:35:40.301
ABOVE. THIRTY THREE WHATEVER

01:35:40.367 --> 01:35:42.069
THAT THAT THE MEASURE OF LIES.

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:43.537
THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:45.840
PARTS PER MILLION AM I WRONG ON

01:35:45.906 --> 01:35:46.540
THAT.

01:35:46.607 --> 01:35:48.075
AS FAR AS TO SAY IF YOU IF YOU

01:35:48.142 --> 01:35:50.244
CAN GET ON TO THE PROPERTY CITY

01:35:50.311 --> 01:35:50.978
THE SAMPLING [inaudible]

01:35:51.045 --> 01:35:53.013
SO.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.148
SO YOU WERE RIGHT.

01:35:54.215 --> 01:35:55.683
YOU ANTICIPATE THAT IF YOU HAVE

01:35:55.749 --> 01:35:57.818
A SOURCE AND YOU SEE DISPERSION

01:35:57.885 --> 01:35:59.520
YOU ARE GOING TO SEE IT

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:01.155
DIMINISHING WITH THE DISTANCE.

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:03.958
THAT IS NOT THE CASE ODD WE HAVE

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:05.860
LOOKED ACT WE'VE BEEN SAMPLING

01:36:05.926 --> 01:36:07.862
SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE

01:36:07.928 --> 01:36:09.230
MADE EXCITES SAMPLE THE FIRST

01:36:09.296 --> 01:36:10.231
TWO HUNDRED PROPERTIES.

01:36:10.297 --> 01:36:12.266
IN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AND

01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:14.135
WE ASK THEM TO FOLLOW THE

01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:16.904
PREDOMINANT WIND DIRECTION.

01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:18.105
AND AND EVEN THEN WE FOUND IN

01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:20.741
THE CLOSEST PROPERTIES WE FOUND.

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:22.510
DIFFERENCES IN CONCENTRATIONS

01:36:22.576 --> 01:36:24.211
NOT ONLY WE ARE FOLLOWING

01:36:24.278 --> 01:36:25.579
AERIALLY DEPOSITED LET.

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:27.314
DO YOU WOULD YOU EXPECT THAT NOT

01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:29.750
ONLY WILL THE OUR CONCENTRATIONS

01:36:29.817 --> 01:36:31.485
DIMINISH AS YOU ALL FARTHER AND

01:36:31.552 --> 01:36:33.521
FARTHER AWAY BUT YOU SHOULD ALSO

01:36:33.587 --> 01:36:35.356
SEE LESSER CONCENTRATIONS ARE

01:36:35.422 --> 01:36:36.357
DEEPER DEPTHS.

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:37.258
WE SAMPLE DOWN TO EIGHTEEN

01:36:37.324 --> 01:36:40.794
INCHES AND SINCE WEARING AT

01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:42.563
DIFFERENT JOBS THERE IS NO

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:44.265
SIMPLE DISTRIBUTION THERE'S NO

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:46.667
SIMPLE PATTERN OF DISTRIBUTION.

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:48.469
AND THERE'S REASONS FOR IT.

01:36:48.536 --> 01:36:50.504
IT MAY HAVE BEEN CHURNED IT MAY

01:36:50.571 --> 01:36:52.039
HAVE BEEN RECONSTRUCTED RIEN

01:36:52.106 --> 01:36:53.874
TRAINED TAKEN AWAY SOMEWHERE

01:36:53.941 --> 01:36:56.343
ELSE AND WE'RE TALKING LEAD

01:36:56.410 --> 01:36:58.112
THERE ARE MANY SOURCES OF BLOOD.

01:36:58.179 --> 01:36:59.880
SO SOMEBODY COULD OF PUT IN

01:36:59.947 --> 01:37:02.082
LANDSCAPE THEIR HOUSE DECIDED TO

01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:03.584
TAKE OUT THE SOIL AND PUT THE

01:37:03.651 --> 01:37:05.753
NEW SOIL IN YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

01:37:05.819 --> 01:37:07.788
REDUCING THE LEAD THERE AND HAD

01:37:07.855 --> 01:37:09.557
KNOWN.

01:37:09.623 --> 01:37:11.392
WAS NO WISER FOR ALL RIGHT.

01:37:11.458 --> 01:37:13.160
PLEASE CONTINUE WITH.

01:37:13.227 --> 01:37:14.495
THOSE SERVICE ON MEETING THE

01:37:14.562 --> 01:37:16.630
COST GOT A COUPLE OF OTHER

01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:18.132
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE

01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:19.300
DIFFICULTY IN ESTIMATING THE

01:37:19.366 --> 01:37:20.935
COST IN THERE OF COURSE RELATED

01:37:21.001 --> 01:37:21.535
TO WHAT WE STARTED OUT A

01:37:21.602 --> 01:37:23.270
CONVERSATION WITH AND AND THAT

01:37:23.337 --> 01:37:25.172
IS -- ACCESS

01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:26.840
TO THE PROPERTIES THEMSELVES SO

01:37:26.907 --> 01:37:28.609
WE ANTICIPATE GETTING ADDITIONAL

01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:30.344
ACCESS AGREEMENTS TO SAMPLING

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:32.746
CLEAN UP THE ROUGHLY SIXTEEN

01:37:32.813 --> 01:37:33.380
HUNDRED PROPERTIES THAT WE HAVE

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:35.249
YET SAMPLED --

01:37:35.316 --> 01:37:36.817
BUT WE ADDITIONALLY AND OUT OF

01:37:36.884 --> 01:37:38.152
THE EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:39.486
PROPERTIES THAT WE'VE SAMPLE TO

01:37:39.553 --> 01:37:40.521
DATE.

01:37:40.588 --> 01:37:42.323
AGAIN -- WE

01:37:42.389 --> 01:37:43.958
CHANGED OUR OUR ACCESS

01:37:44.024 --> 01:37:46.227
AGREEMENTS TO ENABLE THE

01:37:46.293 --> 01:37:48.596
RESIDENTS. TO TO PROVIDE ACCESS

01:37:48.662 --> 01:37:50.798
TO SAMPLE BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE

01:37:50.864 --> 01:37:52.866
THE PROPERTY OWNERS APPROVAL TO

01:37:52.933 --> 01:37:54.568
ACTUALLY DO THE CLEANUP AND SO

01:37:54.635 --> 01:37:59.306
THERE'S WE'LL CONTINUE TO IS TO

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:01.342
GET THAT ACCESS BUT THERE IS A

01:38:01.408 --> 01:38:03.477
DELTA BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF

01:38:03.544 --> 01:38:05.746
PROPERTY SAMPLED AND THOSE.

01:38:05.813 --> 01:38:07.715
THAT HAVE PROVIDED US WITH AXIS

01:38:07.781 --> 01:38:09.416
AGREEMENTS AND THAT ALL IMPACTS

01:38:09.483 --> 01:38:11.719
THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT.

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:14.088
ARE YOU CONSIDERING PUTTING A

01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:17.191
LIEN ON THE PROPERTY FOR NOTICE.

01:38:17.258 --> 01:38:18.926
IS THAT PART OF THE THE PLAN

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:21.528
BECAUSE YOU KNOW AT SOMETIME MY

01:38:21.595 --> 01:38:23.530
PATIENCE IS DONE AND AND JUST

01:38:23.597 --> 01:38:25.232
SAME IT'S IT'S WE WANT TO DO THE

01:38:25.299 --> 01:38:27.101
RIGHT THING BUT IF WE PUT A LIEN

01:38:27.167 --> 01:38:28.802
ON THE PROPERTY IN ANYBODY WHO'S

01:38:28.869 --> 01:38:30.204
GONNA CHOIR THAT PROPERTY KNOWS.

01:38:30.271 --> 01:38:31.872
WHAT A BIG RED SIGN ON THE FRONT

01:38:31.939 --> 01:38:34.008
DOOR AND SAY THIS IS POTENTIALLY

01:38:34.074 --> 01:38:35.376
CONTAMINATE WHATEVER IT IS BUT

01:38:35.442 --> 01:38:36.110
BUT?

01:38:36.176 --> 01:38:39.747

OFF.

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:53.460
WHEN DO A CLEAN UP --

01:38:53.527 --> 01:38:55.863
OR OR YOU CAN CONTINUE TO

01:38:55.929 --> 01:38:57.197
SAMPLING THERE'S THAT SOMEBODY

01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:59.633
BODIES THAT THAT WE HAVE HERE

01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:01.335
AND AT A AND I DON'T WANT TO

01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:03.170
SPEND A LOT OF TIME.

01:39:03.237 --> 01:39:04.705
YOU KNOW AT LEAST IT JUST SEEMS

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:06.340
LIKE EXTRA ORDINARY WE'RE

AND NOW WE'RE ON THE EIGHTH TIME

01:39:09.376 --> 01:39:11.045
IN A NINE TIME AT SOMETIME LET'S

01:39:11.111 --> 01:39:12.913
GO TO THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR

01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:14.348

SO AND THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:39:17.551 --> 01:39:19.553
COMMENT WE WE ARE --

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:21.221
PRIORITIZING ARE CLEAN UP WITH

01:39:21.288 --> 01:39:22.690
THE PROPERTY OWNERS THAT ARE

01:39:22.756 --> 01:39:24.458
WORKING WITH US AND WE HAVE AS

01:39:24.525 --> 01:39:26.460
WE INDICATED FOUR HUNDRED

01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:27.561
NINETEEN PROPERTIES IN THE QUEUE

01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:28.662
WHERE THE PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE

01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:30.197
GRANTED US ACCESS AND WE ARE

01:39:30.264 --> 01:39:32.366
WORKING WITH THEM. TO TO GET

01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:35.536
THEIR PROPERTIES CLEANED UP.

01:39:35.602 --> 01:39:39.907
SO ARE AT UP ABOUT SIXTY

01:39:39.973 --> 01:39:41.375
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PROPERTY --

01:39:41.442 --> 01:39:42.943
BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN

01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:44.511
PROPERTY SIZE EXTENT OF

01:39:44.578 --> 01:39:46.080
CONTAMINATION IN THE EXTENT TO

01:39:46.146 --> 01:39:47.514
WHICH ADDITIONAL MANUAL LABOR

01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:48.949
MAY BE REQUIRED TO CLEAN UP THE

01:39:49.016 --> 01:39:49.750
PROPERTY.

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:51.919
ON THE RANGE CAN BE SOMEWHERE

01:39:51.985 --> 01:39:55.356
BETWEEN. FIFTY TO FIFTY EIGHT

01:39:55.422 --> 01:39:56.490
THOUSAND UPWARDS OF EIGHTY

01:39:56.557 --> 01:39:57.424
THOUSAND SO OUR AVERAGE IS

01:39:57.491 --> 01:40:00.060
AROUND --

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:01.228
SIXTY WITH THE ABOVE DESCRIBED

01:40:01.295 --> 01:40:02.963
ASSUMPTIONS AND AND STAFF

01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:04.865
OPERATING EXPENSES DTS THE

01:40:04.932 --> 01:40:07.534
ESTIMATES IT WILL COST ROUGHLY

01:40:07.601 --> 01:40:08.268
THREE HUNDRED MILLION TO CLEAN

01:40:08.335 --> 01:40:10.304
UP THE REMAINING FORTY FOUR

01:40:10.371 --> 01:40:12.005
HUNDRED PROPERTIES BUT JUST TO

01:40:12.072 --> 01:40:13.941
BE CLEAR THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE

01:40:14.007 --> 01:40:15.109
THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH

01:40:15.175 --> 01:40:16.143
CLEANING UP.

01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:18.278
THE APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:19.713
HUNDRED PROPERTIES THAT HAVE YET

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:20.781
TO BE SAMPLED.

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:23.417
SO BASED ON OUR DATA.

01:40:23.484 --> 01:40:26.320
ABOUT SEVENTY SIX OR 77% OF THE

01:40:26.387 --> 01:40:28.021
PROPERTY SAMPLE TO DATE HAVE

01:40:28.088 --> 01:40:30.023
LEAD LEVELS ABOVE EIGHTY PARTS

01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:31.125
PER MILLION.

01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:32.893
IF WE WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:36.163

NOT YET SAMPLED --

01:40:39.733 --> 01:40:42.603
AND WE ASSUME THAT 77% OF THESE

01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:44.471
PROPERTIES HAVE LEAD LEVELS

01:40:44.538 --> 01:40:45.873
ABOVE EIGHTY PARTS PER MILLION.

01:40:45.939 --> 01:40:47.841

01:40:47.908 --> 01:40:49.376
RELATED WITH THOSE PROPERTIES

01:40:49.443 --> 01:40:51.311
WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY NINETY

01:40:51.378 --> 01:40:53.547
MILLION FOR A TOTAL ESTIMATED

01:40:53.614 --> 01:40:55.082
COST OF THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY

01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:56.517
MILLION IF WE WERE TO CLEAN UP

01:40:56.583 --> 01:40:58.385
ALL PROPERTIES WITHIN THE P. I.

01:40:58.452 --> 01:41:01.555
A THAT TEST --

01:41:01.622 --> 01:41:05.993
OVER THE OUR TARGET CLEANUP CALL.

01:41:06.059 --> 01:41:08.061

INDUSTRY AND A LOT OF-CONTAMINATION.

01:41:11.231 --> 01:41:13.834
AND I KNOW THAT IT'S POPULAR THE

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:16.136

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:27.347
POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THESE

ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC.

01:41:36.056 --> 01:41:37.090

INVESTIGATION THAT THERE WON'T

01:47:34.881 --> 01:47:36.950
BE AN IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES

01:47:37.017 --> 01:47:38.385
AND I DON'T KNOW IF.

01:47:38.451 --> 01:47:41.755
THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE --

01:47:41.822 --> 01:47:43.523
TOOL THAT COULD ALSO.

01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:45.826
REDUCE CONCERN OR FEAR ABOUT

01:47:45.892 --> 01:47:47.327
GRANTING --

01:47:47.394 --> 01:47:48.962
THESE PERMISSIONS.

FOR THE CHURCH ONE A A WALK THE

01:47:55.969 --> 01:47:57.537
NUMBERS IN THE MATH ONE MORE

01:47:57.604 --> 01:47:58.338
TIME AND THEN HAVE SOME

01:47:58.405 --> 01:47:59.172
QUESTIONS --

01:47:59.239 --> 01:48:03.410
FOR THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS

01:48:03.476 --> 01:48:04.544
FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

01:48:04.611 --> 01:48:09.316
SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS A

01:48:09.382 --> 01:48:09.950
THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED WELL

01:48:10.016 --> 01:48:11.718
TO SAY THAT'S BROWN.

01:48:11.785 --> 01:48:12.986
ONE RIGHT BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:48:13.053 --> 01:48:14.187
LOOKING AT ANOTHER.

01:48:14.254 --> 01:48:17.524
OVER FOUR THOUSAND AFTER CORRECT

01:48:17.591 --> 01:48:18.625
THAT WOULD BE ROUND TWO GREATEST

01:48:18.692 --> 01:48:18.925
[inaudible]

01:48:18.992 --> 01:48:20.327
SO.

01:48:20.393 --> 01:48:22.462
THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PARCELS

01:48:22.529 --> 01:48:23.930
CAN YOU GIVE US ONE MORE TIME

01:48:23.997 --> 01:48:25.131
THE OVERALL.

01:48:25.198 --> 01:48:27.033
ANTICIPATED COSTS UNDERSTAND

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:30.070
THAT IT'S NOT IN EXACT BUT WHAT

01:48:30.136 --> 01:48:32.839
THE ANTICIPATED SO THAT THE THE

01:48:32.906 --> 01:48:33.907
THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PARCELS WILL

01:48:33.974 --> 01:48:36.543
BE CLEANED UP WITH THE ORIGINAL

FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A

01:48:48.388 --> 01:48:50.924
TOTAL OF SEVENTY FOUR POINT FIVE

01:48:50.991 --> 01:48:53.793
MILLION DOLLARS. FOR UP TO

01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:58.365
THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PROPERTIES.

01:48:58.431 --> 01:49:00.901
DISTANCE SO QUICK MANNER. FIFTY

01:49:00.967 --> 01:49:03.069
ONE MILLION. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:49:03.136 --> 01:49:04.037
MILLION [inaudible]

01:49:04.104 --> 01:49:31.031
RIGHT [inaudible] ONE SECOND

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:31.564
.

01:49:31.564 --> 01:49:35.902
AND THEN THE OTHER. FOR FORTY

01:49:35.969 --> 01:49:36.536
TWO HUNDRED YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO

01:49:36.603 --> 01:49:38.872
COME BACK ON THE OTHER THE

01:49:38.939 --> 01:49:40.941
ADDITIONAL FORTY FOUR HUNDRED I

01:49:41.007 --> 01:49:43.009
PROVIDED A ROUGH ESTIMATE.

01:49:43.076 --> 01:49:46.112
OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

01:49:46.179 --> 01:49:48.348
BASED ON AN AVERAGE COST PER

01:49:48.415 --> 01:49:50.951
PROPERTY OF SIXTY MILLION PLUS

01:49:51.017 --> 01:49:53.653
OPERATING EXPENSES AND AN

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:57.557
OVERSIGHT CONTRACTOR.

01:49:57.624 --> 01:50:00.460
ARE WE SEEN.

01:50:00.527 --> 01:50:03.096
THEIR PRICE PER PARCEL GO UP ARE

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:04.998
WE SEEN IT HOLDING STEADY

01:50:05.065 --> 01:50:06.199
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU GIVE US A

01:50:06.266 --> 01:50:07.033
RANGE.

01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:10.503
OF APPROXIMATELY FIFTY EIGHT UP

01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:11.037
TO EIGHTY DEPENDING ON THE

01:50:11.104 --> 01:50:12.205
COMPLEXITY I WOULD ASSUME.

01:50:12.272 --> 01:50:13.373
IN THIS.

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:14.341
HAS THAT BEEN HOLDING STEADY CAN

01:50:14.407 --> 01:50:16.609
YOU GIVE SERVE DAY I CAN I CAN

01:50:16.676 --> 01:50:16.977
TALK TO THAT --

01:50:17.043 --> 01:50:19.179
SO.

01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:22.015
THE COST AT THE WHEN WE SAY

01:50:22.082 --> 01:50:23.249
SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:50:23.316 --> 01:50:25.051
PER PARCEL IS AN AVERAGE IT

01:50:25.118 --> 01:50:27.520
DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE

01:50:27.587 --> 01:50:29.456
PARCEL THE COMPLEXITY OF THE

01:50:29.522 --> 01:50:31.458
PARCEL AND THE DEATH BECAUSE WE

01:50:31.524 --> 01:50:33.159
HAVE SAMPLED ALL THESE

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:34.361
PROPERTIES A SERVICE.

01:50:34.427 --> 01:50:35.895
FOLLOWING THE AERIAL LEAD WE

01:50:35.962 --> 01:50:37.597
WANTED TO GET IT DONE.

01:50:37.664 --> 01:50:39.032
AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.

01:50:39.099 --> 01:50:43.103
SO WE WE HAVE PRIORITIZE ON THE

01:50:43.169 --> 01:50:45.071
SURFACE CONCENTRATIONS BUT WHEN

01:50:45.138 --> 01:50:47.540
WE CLEAN UP WE GO DOWN TO TWELVE

01:50:47.607 --> 01:50:48.842
OR EIGHTEEN INCHES STEP.

01:50:48.908 --> 01:50:50.777
WE DON'T KNOW THAT CONCENTRATION

01:50:50.844 --> 01:50:52.512
UNTIL WE GET THERE.

01:50:52.579 --> 01:50:53.780
OUGHT SO THE TOOL THAT IT'S

01:50:53.847 --> 01:50:55.215
DEPENDENT ON THAT IT ALSO IS

01:50:55.281 --> 01:50:57.884
DEPENDENT ON SOMETIMES CAESAR'S

01:50:57.951 --> 01:50:59.252
MOPED PROPERTIES THESE

01:50:59.319 --> 01:51:00.787
PROPERTIES ARE LAID OUT IN SUCH

01:51:00.854 --> 01:51:02.522
A VERY COMPLEX CANNOT GO WITH

01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:04.290
EQUIPMENT --

01:51:04.357 --> 01:51:07.060
BUT MY MOM HAS IT FROM WHERE ARE

01:51:07.127 --> 01:51:09.963
REGIONAL ESTIMATES WERE. TO

01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:11.498
WHERE THEY'RE AT NOW.

01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:12.365
HOUSE OF PLANO YEAH AND AND LET

01:51:12.432 --> 01:51:14.567
ME JUST SAY THEY HAVE INCREASED

01:51:14.634 --> 01:51:16.536
SOMEWHAT THE ORIGINAL COST

01:51:16.603 --> 01:51:19.139
ESTIMATE THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN

01:51:19.205 --> 01:51:20.273
TWENTY FIFTEEN WAS BASED ON

01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:21.975
PROPERTIES THAT EXCITE CLEANED

01:51:22.042 --> 01:51:22.675
UP.

01:51:22.742 --> 01:51:23.977
THEY HAD DIFFERENT CONTRACTUAL

01:51:24.044 --> 01:51:26.579
REQUIREMENTS IN THE STATE HOUSE --

01:51:26.646 --> 01:51:28.815
THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION WAS

01:51:28.882 --> 01:51:30.884
DIFFERENT AT THAT TIME AND WE

01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:32.786
HAD OTHER --

01:51:32.852 --> 01:51:34.354
THINGS THAT ATTRIBUTED TO THE

01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:36.389
INCREASED COST PER PER PROPERTY

01:51:36.456 --> 01:51:38.291
SO THEY HAVE GONE UP --

01:51:38.358 --> 01:51:40.927
OUR OUR ESTIMATE THIS POINT OF

01:51:40.994 --> 01:51:42.695
SIXTY IS AN AVERAGE AS MISS

01:51:42.762 --> 01:51:45.865
PATEL INDICATED AND YOU KNOW --

01:51:45.932 --> 01:51:47.634
YOU ASSUMING THAT YOU KNOW IT

01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:49.369
IT'S GOING TO TAKE US UNTIL

01:51:49.436 --> 01:51:51.337
DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TO

01:51:51.404 --> 01:51:53.473
CLEAN UP THE UP TO THIRTY TWO

01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:54.774
HUNDRED PROPERTIES BY THE TIME

01:51:54.841 --> 01:51:56.609
WE GET TO THE FORTY FOUR HUNDRED

01:51:56.676 --> 01:51:57.210
PROPERTIES WE WOULD NEED TO

01:51:57.277 --> 01:51:58.978
REVISE THAT ESTIMATE BASED ON

01:51:59.045 --> 01:51:59.746
THE INFORMATION WE HAVE AT THAT.

01:51:59.813 --> 01:52:01.681
TIME BUT WE WANTED TO PROVIDE

01:52:01.748 --> 01:52:04.084
THAT ESTIMATE TO YOU AND TO THE

01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:06.553
LA -- ON

01:52:06.619 --> 01:52:09.222
BASED ON THE LINE OF QUESTIONS

01:52:09.289 --> 01:52:09.823
MORE INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:52:09.889 --> 01:52:11.124
FINANCE SO CAN YOU WALK US

01:52:11.191 --> 01:52:14.194
THROUGH.

01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:15.829
OBVIOUSLY THE TOP PRIORITY IS

01:52:15.895 --> 01:52:18.298
THE SAFETY OF NEIGHBORS --

01:52:18.364 --> 01:52:19.966
A AND CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT IS

01:52:20.033 --> 01:52:21.568
LIKE LIVING IN A HOME RIGHT THAT

01:52:21.634 --> 01:52:23.336
NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP LIKE THIS --

01:52:23.403 --> 01:52:27.006
AND BUT ALSO WALKING THROUGH HOW

01:52:27.073 --> 01:52:28.842
YOU ARE LOOKING AT COSTS.

01:52:28.908 --> 01:52:31.177
IN THE MANAGEMENT AS WE MOVE

01:52:31.244 --> 01:52:33.179
THROUGH THIS AS FAR AS WHAT THE

01:52:33.246 --> 01:52:37.250
BUDGET LOOKS LIKE.

01:52:37.317 --> 01:52:38.718
THIS IS A VERY FLUID SITUATION

01:52:38.785 --> 01:52:40.320
RIGHT.

01:52:40.386 --> 01:52:41.588
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE --

01:52:41.654 --> 01:52:42.822
AN IDEA OF WHERE WE NEED TO BE

01:52:42.889 --> 01:52:45.525
ABLE TO GO DEPENDING ON A LOT.

01:52:45.592 --> 01:52:47.360
WHETHER IT'S SLOPED FLAT --

01:52:47.427 --> 01:52:49.295
IF IT'S HOW DEEP THE

01:52:49.362 --> 01:52:50.497
CONTAMINATION IS.

01:52:50.563 --> 01:52:52.799
SO WHATWHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE

01:52:52.866 --> 01:52:53.466
WITHIN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS

01:52:53.533 --> 01:52:55.068
FAR AS TRYING TO MANAGE THAT

01:52:55.135 --> 01:52:56.269
BUDGET JUST.

01:52:56.336 --> 01:52:58.104
BECAUSE IT'S IT IS SO FLUID.

01:52:58.171 --> 01:53:00.240
YES.

01:53:00.306 --> 01:53:02.142
I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION AND

01:53:02.208 --> 01:53:04.277
IT IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING --

01:53:04.344 --> 01:53:05.645
GIVEN.

01:53:05.712 --> 01:53:09.649
ALL OF THE OTHER --

01:53:09.716 --> 01:53:11.518
CHALLENGES THAT THAT DTS HE HAS

01:53:11.584 --> 01:53:13.186
HAD.

01:53:13.253 --> 01:53:15.655
ON THIS PROJECT.

01:53:15.722 --> 01:53:17.657
WE'VE BEEN TRACKING IT CLOSELY

01:53:17.724 --> 01:53:18.525
WITH.

01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:20.226
WITH THE DEPARTMENT.

01:53:20.293 --> 01:53:22.896
AND WHICH IS WHY WE'VE GOTTEN

01:53:22.962 --> 01:53:24.330
THAT.

01:53:24.397 --> 01:53:26.499
EXCUSE ME THE AUTHORITY IN THE

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:30.069
FOR THE ABILITY.

01:53:30.136 --> 01:53:31.771
TO AYLER IT AND WE WOULD BE

01:53:31.838 --> 01:53:34.140
COMING BACK IN FRONT OF THE

01:53:34.207 --> 01:53:35.808
LEGISLATURE AGAIN IF IF THE COST

01:53:35.875 --> 01:53:39.746
TO GO UP --

01:53:39.812 --> 01:53:41.714
WE ARE AGAIN WHICH IS ANOTHER

01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:43.683
REASON WHY WE BUILT IN ANOTHER

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:45.251
FIFTY MILLION WE ARE

01:53:45.318 --> 01:53:47.754
CONCENTRATING ON THE HEALTH AND

01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:49.689
SAFETY OF THOSE RESIDENTS --

01:53:49.756 --> 01:53:51.858
WE DON'T WANT TO JEOPARDIZE

01:53:51.925 --> 01:53:54.260
THEIR HEALTH BECAUSE OF THE

01:53:54.327 --> 01:53:57.063
BUREAUCRACY GOING ON WITH

01:53:57.130 --> 01:53:59.566
FINDING THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES

01:53:59.632 --> 01:54:00.833
AND ACTUALLY GETTING BACK

01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:03.369
FUNDING BACK FROM THEM WHICH IS

01:54:03.436 --> 01:54:05.271
WHY WE'RE DOING THIS IS A LOAN.

01:54:05.338 --> 01:54:08.274
AND THERE IS ALSO --

01:54:08.341 --> 01:54:09.275
MY BELIEVE LANGUAGE IN THE

01:54:09.342 --> 01:54:11.110
ORIGINAL.

01:54:11.177 --> 01:54:14.113
THE ORIGINAL APPROPRIATION.

01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:17.750
THAT -- THAT

01:54:17.817 --> 01:54:18.818
THAT STATES [inaudible]

01:54:18.885 --> 01:54:20.687
THAT.

01:54:20.753 --> 01:54:24.057
IF NO RESPONSIBLE PARTIES ARE.

01:54:24.123 --> 01:54:26.492
AVAILABLE THEN THAN IT IS A

01:54:26.559 --> 01:54:28.795
STATE RESPONSIBILITY.

01:54:28.861 --> 01:54:29.762
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT REALLY

01:54:29.829 --> 01:54:33.967
FULLY ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION.

01:54:34.033 --> 01:54:34.634
I GUESS WHAT I'M I'M SURE LOOK

01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:36.536
AT ANYA GIVEN EXAMPLE SO --

01:54:36.603 --> 01:54:37.537
WHERE I COME FROM THE COUNTY

01:54:37.604 --> 01:54:38.871
CINEMA --

01:54:38.938 --> 01:54:41.341
JAPANESE DECLARED ON A CREEK

01:54:41.407 --> 01:54:42.108
THAT --

01:54:42.175 --> 01:54:43.743
BRINGS WATER DOWN FROM WARM

01:54:43.810 --> 01:54:46.279
SPRINGS DAM TO THE RUSSIAN RIVER.

01:54:46.346 --> 01:54:47.914
I IT'S BECAUSE IT'S ENDANGERED

01:54:47.981 --> 01:54:50.116
COHO HABITAT IN IT WE ARE HAVING

01:54:50.183 --> 01:54:51.284
WE ARE BEING FORCED BY THE

01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:53.419
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHTFULLY SO

01:54:53.486 --> 01:54:54.821
TO BE A GREAT AUSTRIAN HABITAT.

01:54:54.887 --> 01:54:56.623
I BRING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE IN

01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:58.191
WHAT OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATES WERE

01:54:58.258 --> 01:55:00.326
TO BE TO DEVELOP WATER PER MILE

01:55:00.393 --> 01:55:05.031
COSTA DE DEVELOP AT POSTURING

OUTSET OF THIS HEARING THERE IS

02:02:50.029 --> 02:02:52.064
A LARGE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN

IN OAKLAND.

02:03:12.785 --> 02:03:14.286
THERE IS A SITE.

02:03:14.353 --> 02:03:16.255
AGAIN IN AN URBAN AREA WITH

MIXED RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL

02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:20.326
WHERE T. C. E. IS KNOWN. TO BE

02:03:30.569 --> 02:03:32.705
THOUSAND TIMES THE SAFE LEVEL.

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:34.240
THE SOIL IS CONTAMINATED WITH

02:03:34.306 --> 02:03:37.510
CADMIUM LEAD AND NICKEL AND LEAD

02:03:37.576 --> 02:03:38.978
THERE IS A HUNDRED TIMES THE

02:03:40.579 --> 02:03:43.115
THIS SITE IS ON THE THIRD

02:04:05.137 --> 02:04:07.173

AND HEARING OBLIGATIONS SO WE

02:14:20.719 --> 02:14:20.886

FUNDS ARE FROM THE GENERAL FUND

02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:32.164
BECAUSE SOME HEARINGS WILL

02:14:32.230 --> 02:14:33.265
INVOLVE ENFORCEMENT AGAINST

02:14:33.331 --> 02:14:35.133

THIS POINT WE'RE WE'RE

02:14:52.217 --> 02:14:53.452
ESTIMATING THAT THAT WOULD --

02:14:53.518 --> 02:14:55.220
THAT THAT WILL INVOLVE THAT 25%

02:14:55.287 --> 02:14:57.055
OF THE TIME OF THE OFFICE WE

02:14:57.122 --> 02:14:58.657
WILL ADJUST THAT IF WE ACTUALLY

02:14:58.723 --> 02:15:00.091
GET THE OFFICE AND WE ASSESS THE

02:15:00.158 --> 02:15:00.992
CASELOAD.

02:15:01.059 --> 02:15:02.427
SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

02:15:02.494 --> 02:15:03.562
QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ON THIS

02:15:03.628 --> 02:15:04.863
MATTER I KNOW SOME OF THE

02:15:04.930 --> 02:15:07.165
PROPONENTS OF THE GREAT BILL ON

02:15:07.232 --> 02:15:08.600
THE COVER HERE WE ALL.

02:15:08.667 --> 02:15:11.036
WERE -- VERY

02:15:11.102 --> 02:15:12.804
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE

02:15:12.871 --> 02:15:14.339
IMPARTIALITY ABOUT THIS.

02:15:14.406 --> 02:15:19.144
THESE ARE THE SPEECH CAN BE.

02:15:19.211 --> 02:15:21.112
COMPLETED I GUESS NOW THAT WE

02:15:21.179 --> 02:15:22.614
HAVE TO PAY THE BILL SOME FOLKS

02:15:22.681 --> 02:15:24.516
OF RAISE THE CONCERN ABOUT THE

02:15:24.583 --> 02:15:26.084
COST --

02:15:26.151 --> 02:15:26.885
THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE FUND

02:15:26.952 --> 02:15:28.487
NOT TO BUT THE GENERAL FUND

02:15:28.553 --> 02:15:29.621
PORTION OF IT THAT'S OKAY BUT

02:15:29.688 --> 02:15:33.291
THE FUN CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT --

02:15:33.358 --> 02:15:36.828
OF THE SECTION PERHAPS SAID IT

02:15:36.895 --> 02:15:37.195
SAYS [inaudible]

02:15:37.262 --> 02:15:40.298
QUITE EXPENSIVE.

02:15:40.365 --> 02:15:41.800
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW.

02:15:41.867 --> 02:15:44.169
HOW MANY HEARING OFFICERS WERE

02:15:44.236 --> 02:15:45.670
OR NINE I GUESS WE'RE GONNA GET?

02:15:45.737 --> 02:15:46.938
IT WOULD BE NINE POSITIONS THE

02:15:47.005 --> 02:15:48.540
IDEA WOULD BE TO HAVE THREE

02:15:48.607 --> 02:15:51.009
HEARING OFFICERS --

02:15:51.076 --> 02:15:54.179
AND I AM WE CAN RESPOND IN IN --

02:15:54.246 --> 02:15:55.714
MORE DETAIL LATER BUT I I THINK

02:15:55.780 --> 02:15:57.249
THRE ARE SOME MISCONCEPTIONS

02:15:57.315 --> 02:15:59.484
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME DISCUSSIONS

02:15:59.551 --> 02:16:03.622
ABOUT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF OF OF

02:16:03.688 --> 02:16:05.891
FEES I WOULD BE NECESSARY AND

02:16:05.957 --> 02:16:06.791
WHETHER THERE WOULD BE AN AND

02:16:06.858 --> 02:16:07.926
WHETHER THERE WOULD BE AN

02:16:07.993 --> 02:16:09.494
INCREASE IN FEES NECESSARY TO

02:16:09.561 --> 02:16:11.129
COVER ON THE COST OF THIS OFFICE.

02:16:11.196 --> 02:16:14.032
AND IF SO WHAT PERCENTAGE --

02:16:14.099 --> 02:16:15.700
INCREASE THERE WOULD BE AND

02:16:15.767 --> 02:16:17.168
THERE HAS BEEN IN IN --

02:16:17.235 --> 02:16:19.170
SOME STAKEHOLDERS HAVE AN

02:16:19.237 --> 02:16:22.674
ESTIMATED OF THAT OR OR OR

02:16:22.741 --> 02:16:25.310
INTERPRETED OUR DISCUSSIONS

02:16:25.377 --> 02:16:25.677
WHICH ARE NOT --

02:16:25.744 --> 02:16:28.747
WE WE HAVE THE I AM A COMING

02:16:28.813 --> 02:16:30.315
YEAR YET WE'RE STILL HAVING

02:16:30.382 --> 02:16:30.916
STAKEHOLDER OUT REACH MEETINGS

02:16:30.982 --> 02:16:35.153
BUT THE SOME STAKEHOLDERS HAVE

02:16:35.220 --> 02:16:36.988
ESTIMATED THAT WE WERE WE ARE

02:16:37.055 --> 02:16:38.857
LIKELY TO INCREASE OUR WATER

02:16:38.924 --> 02:16:40.859
RIGHT FEES BY 15%.

02:16:40.926 --> 02:16:42.294
AND WE DON'T WE DO NOT BELIEVE

02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:43.562
THAT IS CORRECT.

02:16:43.628 --> 02:16:46.731
UP WE'VE WE BELIEVE THAT --

02:16:46.798 --> 02:16:48.600
IT IT.

02:16:48.667 --> 02:16:50.302
IT'S LITTLE MORE LIKELY TO BE

02:16:50.368 --> 02:16:52.203
ABOUT 7% --

02:16:52.270 --> 02:17:00.946
THAT IS PARTLY BECAUSE THE IT IT

02:17:01.012 --> 02:17:03.582
WILL M..

02:17:03.648 --> 02:17:05.650
PART PARTS OF THE INCREASE WILL

02:17:05.717 --> 02:17:06.585
COME OUT AT PARTS OF THE

02:17:06.651 --> 02:17:07.886
INCREASE OF OUR PROPOSED

02:17:07.953 --> 02:17:09.521
INCREASES IN FEES ARE GOING TO

02:17:09.588 --> 02:17:10.555
GO.

STAKEHOLDER GROUPS WHICH WILL

02:17:21.132 --> 02:17:23.835

02:17:23.902 --> 02:17:26.671
OF THOSE FEES THOSE OTHER FEES

02:17:26.738 --> 02:17:29.040
IF THEY DO COME TO PASS --

02:17:29.107 --> 02:17:29.341
ANOTHER -- I

02:17:29.407 --> 02:17:32.911
THINK IT'S A CAPTION OR YOU KNOW

02:17:32.978 --> 02:17:34.212
MISS OF MISUNDERSTANDING THAT

02:17:34.279 --> 02:17:35.547
WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH OUR

02:17:35.614 --> 02:17:37.649
STAKEHOLDERS TO CLEAR UP IS THAT

02:17:37.716 --> 02:17:39.217
SOMEHOW --

02:17:39.284 --> 02:17:40.852
SINCE WE ARE ANTICIPATING THAT --

02:17:40.919 --> 02:17:42.153
SOME -- SOME

02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:44.055
OF THE CASES HANDLED BY THIS

02:17:44.122 --> 02:17:45.690
OFFICE WILL INVOLVE --

02:17:45.757 --> 02:17:48.093
WATER RATES FOR CANNABIS --

02:17:48.159 --> 02:17:49.394
OPERATIONS --

02:17:49.461 --> 02:17:51.229
AND THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER WATER

02:17:51.296 --> 02:17:51.963
RIGHT -- FEE

02:17:52.030 --> 02:17:53.398
PAYERS ARE GOING TO BE BEARING

02:17:53.465 --> 02:17:56.434
THE THE BURDEN OF THOSE MATTERS.

02:17:56.501 --> 02:17:58.069
IN FACT FOR THE WATER RIGHT --

02:17:58.136 --> 02:18:00.305
ISSUES THE CANNABIS OPERATORS DO

02:18:00.372 --> 02:18:03.274
PAY FEES THEY'RE ACTUALLY MORE

02:18:03.341 --> 02:18:05.443
THAN THE FEES FOR OTHER --

02:18:05.510 --> 02:18:09.781
WATER RIGHT AND STAKEHOLDERS --

02:18:09.848 --> 02:18:12.851

02:18:12.917 --> 02:18:15.620
FOURTEEN AND AND RIPARIAN USERS

02:18:15.687 --> 02:18:16.821
AS WELL SO --

02:18:16.888 --> 02:18:18.256
IN ARGUE THEY WILL BE BEARING

02:18:18.323 --> 02:18:19.324
THE CANOPY TO THE EXTENT THERE

02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:21.626
ARE ADDITIONAL CANNABIS CASES

02:18:21.693 --> 02:18:23.762
THEY WILL BE BEARING THE COST --

02:18:23.828 --> 02:18:25.730
IT WILL NOT BE OF THOSE CASES

02:18:25.797 --> 02:18:27.766
OUT OF THEIR FIFTY PORTION AND

02:18:27.832 --> 02:18:30.035
WE WILL --

02:18:30.101 --> 02:18:31.636
TAKE A LOOK AT THE CASE LOAD OF

02:18:31.703 --> 02:18:32.971
THE OFFICE OF ITS ESTABLISH FROM

02:18:33.038 --> 02:18:34.506
YOU KNOW AND ON ANNUAL BASIS AND

02:18:34.572 --> 02:18:35.874
SEE WHAT THE CASE BREAKDOWN IS

02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:37.942
AN ADJUSTER FEES ACCORDINGLY SO

02:18:38.009 --> 02:18:39.444
THAT'S I THINK.

02:18:39.511 --> 02:18:40.445
THANK YOU FROM OF THE ISSUES

02:18:40.512 --> 02:18:42.013
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AND AND

02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:43.348
THEN IF I'M IF I MIGHT JUST BE

02:18:43.415 --> 02:18:45.250
ANOTHER ISSUE IS WHETHER THERE

02:18:45.316 --> 02:18:47.285
SHOULD BE A TWO OTHERS WANT ONE

02:18:47.352 --> 02:18:50.855
SHOULD THERE BE A DELAY IN THE

02:18:50.922 --> 02:18:51.556
IN THIS MATTER --

02:18:51.623 --> 02:18:53.224
WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

02:18:53.291 --> 02:18:54.559
UNDER --

02:18:54.626 --> 02:18:56.327
DISSED UNDER THE ESTABLISHING --

YOU KNOW AB SEVEN FORTY SEVEN AS

02:18:58.963 --> 02:19:00.565
OF JULY FIRST.

02:19:00.632 --> 02:19:02.067
IT IS REQUIRED THAT ANY WATER

02:19:02.133 --> 02:19:03.368
RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT MATTERS BE

02:19:03.435 --> 02:19:05.236
HANDLED BY THE OFFICE NOT BY THE

02:19:05.303 --> 02:19:06.671
BOARD ITSELF AND THAT WOULD

02:19:06.738 --> 02:19:09.574
CREATE A GAP IN OUR ABILITY --

02:19:09.641 --> 02:19:10.875
TO ENFORCING HOLD HEARINGS AND I

02:19:10.942 --> 02:19:12.410
WE THINK THAT THAT IS AND I'M

02:19:12.477 --> 02:19:14.579
NOT A GREAT MESSAGE I'M. TO BE

02:19:14.646 --> 02:19:16.514
SENT -- TO

02:19:16.581 --> 02:19:20.785
NOT THE COMMUNITY AGES IS --

02:19:20.852 --> 02:19:23.521
I'M COMPLIANT BUT TWO OUTLIERS

02:19:23.588 --> 02:19:25.256
WHO MIGHT SEE I AS A LICENSE TO

02:19:25.323 --> 02:19:27.192
NOT COMPLY OR TO ASK FOR

02:19:27.258 --> 02:19:27.859
HEARINGS.

02:19:27.926 --> 02:19:29.394
AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S BEEN

02:19:29.461 --> 02:19:30.695
SOME SUGGESTION THAT PERHAPS WE

02:19:30.762 --> 02:19:32.297
SHOULD WRAP THIS OFFICE UP

02:19:32.363 --> 02:19:35.066
SLOWLY START WITH A SMALLER STOP.

02:19:35.133 --> 02:19:37.135
UP PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS --

02:19:37.202 --> 02:19:38.570
ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS OFFICE IS

02:19:38.636 --> 02:19:40.138
IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF A

02:19:40.205 --> 02:19:41.673
SUBSTANTIAL BACKLOG.

02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:43.842
AND DELAYS THAT DO OCCUR SO WE

02:19:43.908 --> 02:19:46.044
ACTUALLY BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY

02:19:46.111 --> 02:19:47.879
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT --

02:19:47.946 --> 02:19:49.147
TO GET THE OFFICE UP TO FULL

02:19:49.214 --> 02:19:50.048
STRENGTH DEAL WITH THOSE

02:19:50.115 --> 02:19:53.051
BACKLOGS AND AND HAVE THIS BE A

02:19:53.118 --> 02:19:55.553
MUCH MORE TIMELY AND EFFICIENT --

02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:58.389
OPERATION STONE THE THE MOTION

02:19:58.456 --> 02:20:00.125
IS TO APPROVE THE BUDGET THAT

02:20:00.191 --> 02:20:02.460
WILL ALLOW THE AGENCY TO

02:20:02.527 --> 02:20:04.429
IDENTIFY WHO THOSE THREE OF

02:20:04.496 --> 02:20:05.797

MEMBERS DOING THOSE HEARINGS NOW

02:20:14.139 --> 02:20:16.775

02:27:24.101 --> 02:27:26.370
FAILING OR ARE NOT PROVIDING

02:27:26.437 --> 02:27:28.172
SAFE DRINKING WATER --

02:27:28.239 --> 02:27:29.373
TO THE FOLKS THIS IS GONNA BE

02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:30.508
SYSTEM WIDE.

02:27:30.575 --> 02:27:31.842
THIS IS MORE SYSTEM WIDE

02:27:31.909 --> 02:27:33.878
CERTAINLY WE ALREADY PUT A LOT

02:27:33.945 --> 02:27:35.213
OF FOCUS ON THOSE SYSTEMS WE

02:27:35.279 --> 02:27:36.681
KNOW ARE FAILING --

02:27:36.747 --> 02:27:37.682
BUT THERE ARE SYSTEMS THAT WE

02:27:37.748 --> 02:27:39.050
ARE GETTING TUNE SO THIS IS

02:27:39.116 --> 02:27:40.051
REALLY TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:27:40.117 --> 02:27:41.485
WE GET ALL THE SYSTEMS THAT WE

02:27:41.552 --> 02:27:42.286
CAN.

02:27:42.353 --> 02:27:43.955
AND PRESUMABLY THESE AT THIS

02:27:44.021 --> 02:27:47.258
ADDITIONAL SURVEY INFORMATION

02:27:47.325 --> 02:27:49.060
WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO

02:27:49.126 --> 02:27:50.595
MAKE THE DECISIONS ON

02:27:50.661 --> 02:27:54.131
CONSOLIDATION AND YOU KNOW

02:27:54.198 --> 02:27:55.566
MANDATES.

02:27:55.633 --> 02:27:56.167
THEN THE LIKE THESE THESE ARE

02:27:56.234 --> 02:27:57.735
THE OUR FRONTLINE STAFF THAT ARE

02:27:57.802 --> 02:27:58.936
IN OUR DISTRICT OFFICES

02:27:59.003 --> 02:28:00.271
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT ARE

02:28:00.338 --> 02:28:01.939
THE FIRST CONTACT OF THOSE WATER

02:28:02.006 --> 02:28:03.241
SYSTEMS THERE ARE EARLY

02:28:03.307 --> 02:28:04.875
INDICATOR OF WHEN THEY'RE LIKELY

02:28:04.942 --> 02:28:06.577
TO HAVE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE.

02:28:06.644 --> 02:28:07.678
AND WE WE WOULD REALLY RATHER

02:28:07.745 --> 02:28:09.247
GET TO AN EVEN BEFORE THEY SHOW

02:28:09.313 --> 02:28:10.248
UP ON ARGUMENT RIGHT TO WATER

02:28:10.314 --> 02:28:11.682
LISTS OF DEFINITELY.

02:28:11.749 --> 02:28:13.284
AND I DON'T HAVE GOOGLE MAPS

02:28:13.351 --> 02:28:15.186
WITH ME BUT I ASSUME THAT GIVE

02:28:15.253 --> 02:28:17.989
IN TRAFFIC PATTERNS AREAS THAT

02:28:18.055 --> 02:28:20.258
THEY HAVE TO WORK THAT THAT THAT.

02:28:20.324 --> 02:28:23.160
WE'RE GOING TO BE MAXIMIZING.

02:28:23.227 --> 02:28:25.329
EFFICIENCIES OF WHEN THEY GO OUT

02:28:25.396 --> 02:28:26.797
TO THIS AREA WITH THE DIFF WITH

02:28:26.864 --> 02:28:28.966
DIFFERENT PEOPLE I IMAGINE YOU

02:28:29.033 --> 02:28:31.435
KNOW SOMEONE IS A LOOK AT THE

02:28:31.502 --> 02:28:32.303
MAP SOME OF THESE AREAS ARE.

02:28:32.370 --> 02:28:33.704
A LONG DISTANCE TO GO TO DO ONE

02:28:33.771 --> 02:28:37.074
SURVEY OTHERS MAY BE.

02:28:37.141 --> 02:28:38.409
IT'S WHAT THEY SAY IN LA FOR THE

02:28:38.476 --> 02:28:41.279
FOUR OH FIVE YEAR.

02:28:41.345 --> 02:28:42.680
IT'S JUST A BAD THING.

02:28:42.747 --> 02:28:44.649
YES WE WE DEFINITELY DO TRY TO

02:28:44.715 --> 02:28:46.384
OPTIMIZE THAT WAY AND YOU'RE

02:28:46.450 --> 02:28:47.685
RIGHT IN LA WE DON'T TALK ABOUT

02:28:47.752 --> 02:28:49.320
DISTANCE WE TALK ABOUT HOW LONG

02:28:49.387 --> 02:28:51.589
IT TAKES TO GET THERE.

02:28:51.656 --> 02:28:53.791
ELLIE ARE YOU HAVE SOMETHING.

02:28:53.858 --> 02:28:55.559
ON ISSUE.

02:28:55.626 --> 02:28:57.028
SEVENTEEN NOTHING TO ADD ALL

02:28:57.094 --> 02:28:58.963
RIGHT THIS IS.

02:28:59.030 --> 02:29:01.599
A QUESTION PROOF IS BUDGETED

IN ONE TIME COSTS LARGELY

02:29:43.607 --> 02:29:44.975
CONTRACT BECAUSE IT WE WILL

02:29:45.042 --> 02:29:47.278
EXPAND TO WORK ON DEVELOPING A

02:29:47.345 --> 02:29:49.513
METHOD OF TESTING FOR MICHAEL

02:29:49.580 --> 02:29:50.381
PASTA X..

02:29:50.448 --> 02:29:52.616
MICHAEL PLASTICS ARE A VERY

02:29:52.683 --> 02:29:54.752
COMPLEX WORLD WERE ENTERING INTO

02:29:54.819 --> 02:29:55.886
HERE WERE.

02:29:55.953 --> 02:29:57.388
PLEASE TO START ON THIS THIS IS

02:29:57.455 --> 02:29:59.023
REALLY THE FIRST STEP IN TRYING

02:29:59.090 --> 02:30:00.257
TO FIGURE OUT HEALTH IMPACTS IS

02:30:00.324 --> 02:30:01.992
TO HAVE A METHOD THAT CAN BE

02:30:02.059 --> 02:30:04.061
REPEATED BY EVERYBODY THE DOES

02:30:04.128 --> 02:30:05.363
THE TEST SO THAT WE KNOW.

02:30:05.429 --> 02:30:06.130
WHEN SOMEONE GIVES AN ANSWER

02:30:06.197 --> 02:30:08.332
IT'S THE SAME IN DIFFERENT

02:30:08.399 --> 02:30:10.134
LABORATORY OR NOT?

02:30:10.201 --> 02:30:11.502
AND THE COMPLEXITY OF MICHAEL

02:30:11.569 --> 02:30:13.170
PLASTICS COMES FROM THE FACT

02:30:13.237 --> 02:30:14.972
THAT JUST BY THE MID TERM OF IT

02:30:15.039 --> 02:30:16.941
IT CAN INCLUDE.

02:30:17.007 --> 02:30:18.843
PAINT CHIPS MICROFIBER IS FROM

02:30:18.909 --> 02:30:21.779
CLOTHING PLASTIC THAT'S DEGRADED

02:30:21.846 --> 02:30:23.080
IN THE ENVIRONMENT ALL SORTS OF

02:30:23.147 --> 02:30:25.149
DIFFERENT COMPONENTS AND TESTING

02:30:25.216 --> 02:30:26.784
FOR IT IS OF WHETHER OUR

02:30:26.851 --> 02:30:28.219
ACADEMIC METHODS OUT THERE.

02:30:28.285 --> 02:30:29.220
THERE'S REALLY NONE THAT HAVE

02:30:29.286 --> 02:30:30.688
GONE THROUGH A FULL METHOD

02:30:30.755 --> 02:30:32.289
DEVELOPMENT TEST PROCESS AND SO

02:30:32.356 --> 02:30:33.824
THIS FUNDING WILL ALLOW US TO DO

02:30:33.891 --> 02:30:34.692
THAT.

02:30:34.759 --> 02:30:36.327
AND I GET TO THAT AND START ON

02:30:36.394 --> 02:30:37.661
THE PROCESS OF UNDERSTANDING

02:30:37.728 --> 02:30:39.497
WHAT THIS IS AN ENVIRONMENT HOW

02:30:39.563 --> 02:30:42.166
WHAT THE QUANTITIES ARE AND WHAT

02:30:42.233 --> 02:30:42.767
POTENTIAL HEALTH IMPACTS ASIDE

02:30:42.833 --> 02:30:44.602
FROM THAT [inaudible]

02:30:44.668 --> 02:30:45.503
LIAM [inaudible]

02:30:45.569 --> 02:30:47.805
NOTHING [inaudible]

02:30:47.872 --> 02:30:49.840
CENTER MONNING.

02:30:49.907 --> 02:30:51.509
THANK YOU YOU MENTIONED IT AT

02:30:51.575 --> 02:30:55.279
THE END THAT PART OF THE TESTING.

02:30:55.346 --> 02:30:56.881
THERE'S THE DETECTION AND THEN

02:30:56.947 --> 02:30:58.282
THERE'S UNDERSTANDING THE PUBLIC

02:30:58.349 --> 02:31:01.185
HEALTH IMPACT YES.

02:31:01.252 --> 02:31:02.853
WHAT PART OF THIS OR WHAT

02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:05.556
STUDIES ARE GOING ON TO MEASURE?

02:31:05.623 --> 02:31:09.560
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS OF THESE

02:31:09.627 --> 02:31:11.362
MICROBEADS IN DRINKING WATER.

02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:12.830
SO THERE'S NONE TAT ARE UNDER

02:31:12.897 --> 02:31:14.999
WAY BY US SPECIFICALLY WERE

02:31:15.065 --> 02:31:16.400
REALLY TASK OF TRYING TO GET THE

02:31:16.467 --> 02:31:17.668
YOU THAT THE METHOD ESTABLISHED

02:31:17.735 --> 02:31:18.736
SO THAT WE HAVE A COMPARABLE

02:31:18.803 --> 02:31:20.404
BASIS TO GO FROM I DO KNOW THAT

02:31:20.471 --> 02:31:22.039
THERE ARE ACADEMIC RESEARCH

02:31:22.106 --> 02:31:24.108
GOING ON ASSOCIATED WITH THE

02:31:24.175 --> 02:31:25.342
HELP OF MICHAEL PLASTICS.

02:31:25.409 --> 02:31:26.844
IS THAT'S ANOTHER COMPLICATED

02:31:26.911 --> 02:31:28.379
FACTORS WELL BECAUSE SOMETIMES

02:31:28.446 --> 02:31:30.247
THE MARKER PLASTICS THE PLASTIC

02:31:30.314 --> 02:31:31.715
THEMSELF IS NOT.

02:31:31.782 --> 02:31:32.850
THE TOXIC COMPONENT IT'S THAT IT

02:31:32.917 --> 02:31:36.287
ABSORBS CAN INTO BEING A

02:31:36.353 --> 02:31:37.655
DELIVERY METHOD OR A FOCUS

02:31:37.721 --> 02:31:39.723
CONCENTRATION SO THERE'S A LOT

02:31:39.790 --> 02:31:41.225
OF WORK YET TO BE DONE ON THIS.

02:31:41.292 --> 02:31:43.093
WOMAN MONETARY AND ONE IN ONE

02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:44.728
AREA MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THAN

02:31:44.795 --> 02:31:49.066
ABSOLUTELY YES OTHER RIGHT.

02:31:49.133 --> 02:31:50.434
I APPLAUD THE EFFORT TOM.

02:31:50.501 --> 02:31:52.503
I WOULD THINK IN ADDITION TO THE

02:31:52.570 --> 02:31:53.838
DETECTION.

02:31:53.904 --> 02:31:56.874
COLLECTING THE SCIENTIFIC DATA

02:31:56.941 --> 02:31:58.242
THAT IS BEING DONE BY OTHERS IS

02:31:58.309 --> 02:32:01.579
THAT PART OF YES SO CORRECT SO

02:32:01.645 --> 02:32:02.746
WE'RE WE'RE ALREADY.

02:32:02.813 --> 02:32:04.515
PRE PLANNING AS WERE DEVELOPING

02:32:04.582 --> 02:32:05.616
THE METHOD AND GOING TO THAT

02:32:05.683 --> 02:32:07.451
WORK THAT THE HEALTH RESEARCHERS

02:32:07.518 --> 02:32:09.086
WILL BE THERE WITH US AND

02:32:09.153 --> 02:32:10.454
UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW KIND OF

02:32:10.521 --> 02:32:11.789
WHERE WE'RE TARGETING WITH THAT.

02:32:11.856 --> 02:32:12.890
AND BE PART OF THE METHOD

02:32:12.957 --> 02:32:14.558
DEVELOPMENT SO THAT THEY KNOW

02:32:14.625 --> 02:32:15.960
HOW TO BASICALLY.

02:32:16.026 --> 02:32:17.895
KEEP THE BALL ROLLING FROM ONE

02:32:17.962 --> 02:32:18.896
TO THE OTHER SO IT'S A SEAMLESS

02:32:18.963 --> 02:32:21.131
TRANSITION ASSUME YOU'RE YOUR

02:32:21.198 --> 02:32:22.633

AND PRESUMABLY ONCE WE GET THE

02:32:27.805 --> 02:32:29.373
ANALYTICS IN THE PROCESS THAN

02:32:29.440 --> 02:32:30.174
THAT.

RESOLVED THEN THAT WHATEVER WE

02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:44.688
HOWEVER WE MEASURE IT WE KNOW

02:32:44.755 --> 02:32:46.023
WHAT IT IS THEN THE ANSWER.

02:32:46.090 --> 02:32:48.158
SHOULD BE WHICH SHE I WILL BE

02:33:50.521 --> 02:33:51.589
THIS IS YOU KNOW WE DO A LOT OF

02:33:51.655 --> 02:33:53.390
RECYCLING IN CALIFORNIA A

02:33:53.457 --> 02:33:54.825
MUNICIPAL SITES LARGE.

02:33:54.892 --> 02:33:55.693
COMPONENTS WHERE WE DO THE

02:33:55.759 --> 02:33:58.662
RECYCLING IN WERE OR REALLY WHAT

02:33:58.729 --> 02:34:00.230
THIS IS ABOUT IS.

02:34:00.297 --> 02:34:01.865
BUILDING LEVEL RECYCLING SO THE

02:34:01.932 --> 02:34:03.167
WATER NEVER LEAVES THE BUILDING

02:34:03.233 --> 02:34:06.604
IT BECOMES RECYCLED AND CAN BE

02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:08.672
IT'S MERGING AREA THAT THAT'S

02:34:08.739 --> 02:34:10.074
HAPPENING IN WERE YOU KNOW PARTS

02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:11.775
OF ONE OFF APPROVALS AND SAN

02:34:11.842 --> 02:34:12.977
FRANCISCO EN EL áREA IS

02:34:13.043 --> 02:34:14.478
ASSOCIATE WITH THIS.

02:34:14.545 --> 02:34:16.146
AND REALLY THIS IS TO DEVELOP

02:34:16.213 --> 02:34:17.648
THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE SO THAT.

02:34:17.715 --> 02:34:19.216
LOCAL AGENCIES CAN DECIDE

02:34:19.283 --> 02:34:20.451
WHETHER THEY WANT THIS PROGRAM

02:34:20.517 --> 02:34:22.286
IN AND USE THOSE.

02:34:22.353 --> 02:34:23.120
GUIDELINES WE GIVE THEM IN THIS

02:34:23.187 --> 02:34:24.655
ROAD FOR APPROACH TO HAVE A

02:34:24.722 --> 02:34:26.190
PROGRAM THAT CAN GOING FORWARD

02:34:26.256 --> 02:34:27.491
IT'S NOT GONNA BE.

02:34:27.558 --> 02:34:28.459
STATE PROGRAM FROM THE

02:34:28.525 --> 02:34:29.793
STANDPOINT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:31.395
THE BUILDING SCALE IT OBVIOUSLY

02:34:31.462 --> 02:34:32.029
HAS TO BE THE LOCALS THAT ARE

02:34:32.096 --> 02:34:32.830
INVOLVED.

02:34:32.896 --> 02:34:34.398
AND WE'RE TALKING NOT JUST GRAY

02:34:34.465 --> 02:34:35.933
WATER WE'RE TALKING BLACK WATER

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:37.735
FOR TALKING ALL THE WHOLE WATER

02:34:37.801 --> 02:34:41.171
DOES CONTAIN AND WE HAVE A

02:34:41.238 --> 02:34:43.107
DIVERSITY OF WATER SYSTEMS HERE

02:34:43.173 --> 02:34:45.042
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE

02:34:45.109 --> 02:34:46.944
WOULD IMAGINE THAT THIS WOULD BE.

02:34:47.011 --> 02:34:50.748
FOCUSED ON THE TOP AND OUR LEASE

02:34:50.814 --> 02:34:52.383
I ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL BE DAY

02:34:52.449 --> 02:34:53.784
THE EFFICIENT ONES THAT ARE.

02:34:53.851 --> 02:34:55.319
THAT ARE IN COMPLIANCE AND THAT

02:34:55.386 --> 02:34:59.089
WITH THIS DECIDE TO TRY THE OUR

02:34:59.156 --> 02:35:00.991
IN HOUSE.

02:35:01.058 --> 02:35:02.960
OF TREASON SYSTEM.

02:35:03.027 --> 02:35:05.629
YEAH ABSOLUTELY IT'S GONNA BE OF

02:35:05.696 --> 02:35:06.230
YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE COST

02:35:06.296 --> 02:35:07.598
PROHIBITIVE IN MANY AREAS THIS

02:35:07.665 --> 02:35:09.266
ISN'T A UNIVERSAL SOLUTION BUT

02:35:09.333 --> 02:35:10.534
THERE IS DEFINITELY APPLICATION

02:35:10.601 --> 02:35:11.835
FORD IN SOME CASES.

02:35:11.902 --> 02:35:13.303
WHERE IT MAKES SENSE TO YOU KNOW

02:35:13.370 --> 02:35:14.371
NOT TRANSPORT WATER BACK AND

02:35:14.438 --> 02:35:16.440
FORTH LONG DISTANCES AND JUST

02:35:16.507 --> 02:35:17.875
RECYCLING ON THE SITE WHERE THAT?

02:35:17.941 --> 02:35:19.209
LOW'S THERE THE CAPABILITY THAN

02:35:19.276 --> 02:35:20.444
TO REUSE IT IS AND IT MAKES

02:35:20.511 --> 02:35:21.512
ECONOMIC SENSE IN THOSE

02:35:21.578 --> 02:35:22.846
COMPONENTS.

NO ANY COMMENTS ON THIS IS NOT

02:35:29.353 --> 02:35:30.554
POSSIBLE.

THAT HAVE INADEQUATE SEPTIC

TO SOURCES OF DRINKING WATER SO

02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:04.882
THIS YOU KNOW IMPACTS NOT JUST

02:37:04.948 --> 02:37:06.116
INDIVIDUAL --

02:37:06.183 --> 02:37:07.451
PROPERTIES WITH SEPTIC SYSTEMS

02:37:07.518 --> 02:37:08.619
BUTTON POTENTIALLY CAN

02:37:08.685 --> 02:37:10.854
CONTAMINATE LARGER GROUNDWATER

02:37:10.921 --> 02:37:12.222
SOURCES.

02:37:12.289 --> 02:37:13.824
USED -- FOR

02:37:13.891 --> 02:37:18.295
THANK YOU WATER AND AFFECT ME SO --

02:37:18.362 --> 02:37:19.396
THEM -- AS

02:37:19.463 --> 02:37:21.131
AS AS I'VE SAID THEY IF THEY'RE

02:37:21.198 --> 02:37:23.367
NOT IF IF SEPTIC TANKS ARE

02:37:23.433 --> 02:37:24.835
IMPROPERLY MAINTAINED IF THEY

02:37:24.902 --> 02:37:26.870
WEAR OUT OVER TIME IF THERE USED

02:37:26.937 --> 02:37:28.438
TO BE ON THEIR ORIGINAL CAPACITY.

02:37:28.505 --> 02:37:29.573
THEY OFTEN BECOME A SOURCE OF

02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:31.208
POLLUTION FOR SURROUNDING

02:37:31.275 --> 02:37:32.810
WATERWAYS AND GROUND WATERS --

02:37:32.876 --> 02:37:35.312
AND OUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT THERE

02:37:35.379 --> 02:37:36.146
ARE DOZENS OF WATER WAYS THAT

02:37:36.213 --> 02:37:37.314
ARE NOW --

02:37:37.381 --> 02:37:38.749
COMPROMISED --

02:37:38.816 --> 02:37:40.617
AND IMPAIRED DUE TO CONTAMINANTS

02:37:40.684 --> 02:37:42.019
THAT CAN REASONABLY BE TREATED

02:37:42.085 --> 02:37:45.422
TRACED TO LEAKING SEPTIC.

02:37:45.489 --> 02:37:46.890
TANKS IN THE SURROUNDING REGION

02:37:46.957 --> 02:37:47.925
AND CURRENTLY THERE IS ACTUALLY

02:37:47.991 --> 02:37:49.726
LITTLE INCENTIVE OR OR EVEN

02:37:49.793 --> 02:37:52.996
ABILITY FOR MANY PROPERTY OWNERS

02:37:53.063 --> 02:37:53.597
TO MAKE THE CHANGE FROM SEPTIC

02:37:53.664 --> 02:37:54.565
TO SEWER.

02:37:54.631 --> 02:37:57.000
IN MANY CASES SEPTIC TANKS SERVE

02:37:57.067 --> 02:37:59.136
RURAL AND SPARSELY POPULATED

02:37:59.203 --> 02:38:00.571
AREAS --

02:38:00.637 --> 02:38:01.939
MOST MOST OF THOSE PROPERTY

02:38:02.005 --> 02:38:02.940
OWNERS REALLY HAVE LITTLE

02:38:03.006 --> 02:38:04.141
ALTERNATIVE THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:38:04.208 --> 02:38:06.410
FINANCIAL ABILITY OR

02:38:06.476 --> 02:38:07.744
ORGANIZATIONAL ABILITY.

02:38:07.811 --> 02:38:09.479
TO I'M NOT TO DO TO USE ANY

02:38:09.546 --> 02:38:12.182
OTHER SYSTEM BUT EVEN IN CASES

02:38:12.249 --> 02:38:12.916
WHERE PROPERTY OWNERS ARE IN

02:38:12.983 --> 02:38:15.052
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO COMMUNITIES

02:38:15.118 --> 02:38:16.386
THAT DO HAVE --

02:38:16.453 --> 02:38:18.088
A FUNCTIONING WASTE WATER SYSTEM.

02:38:18.155 --> 02:38:21.525
SEWER SYSTEM --

02:38:21.592 --> 02:38:24.528
THE COSTS OF REMOVE.

02:38:24.595 --> 02:38:26.296
AND FREQUENTLY.

02:38:26.363 --> 02:38:27.664
THE POTENTIALLY POTENTIAL

02:38:27.731 --> 02:38:28.498
RECEIVING --

02:38:28.565 --> 02:38:30.934
SYSTEM IS UNWILLING TO TAKE ON

02:38:31.001 --> 02:38:33.103
ADDITIONAL --

02:38:33.170 --> 02:38:35.739
WITH WATER AT ABOUT COMMUNITIES --

02:38:35.806 --> 02:38:37.374
SERVE BY SEPTIC TANKS.

02:38:37.441 --> 02:38:38.141
THE RESOURCES THAT WERE

02:38:38.208 --> 02:38:39.443
REQUESTING WILL LLOW THE STATE

02:38:39.509 --> 02:38:41.011
AND REGIONAL BOARDS TO IMPLEMENT

02:38:41.078 --> 02:38:43.881
THE REQUIREMENTS OF SB --

02:38:43.947 --> 02:38:44.448
TWELVE FIFTEEN IN ORDER THE

02:38:44.514 --> 02:38:46.850
NECESSARY CONSOLIDATIONS FOR

02:38:46.917 --> 02:38:47.217
DISADVANTAGE --

02:38:47.284 --> 02:38:48.218
COMMUNITIES --

02:38:48.285 --> 02:38:49.953
SO EACH CONSOLIDATION OR

02:38:50.020 --> 02:38:51.421
EXTENSION OF SERVICE.

02:38:51.488 --> 02:38:53.390
CHIEF WILL ENSURE REAL RELIABLE

02:38:53.457 --> 02:38:54.024
SERVICE.

02:38:54.091 --> 02:38:55.325
THEY WERE SERVICE FOR

02:38:55.392 --> 02:38:57.294
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES --

02:38:57.361 --> 02:38:58.629
AND PROTECTS WATER QUALITY AND

02:38:58.695 --> 02:39:00.130
I'M.

02:39:00.197 --> 02:39:01.265
IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH GENERALLY

02:39:01.331 --> 02:39:02.666
OF COURSE WE WON'T MOVE TO

02:39:02.733 --> 02:39:04.101
MANDATORY CONSOLIDATIONS WITHOUT

02:39:04.167 --> 02:39:06.470
A LOT OF PROCESS IS SPECIFIED IN

02:39:06.536 --> 02:39:10.073
THE LEGISLATION.

02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:11.775
AND ATTEMPTS --

02:39:11.842 --> 02:39:12.709
TO NOT TO WORK EXTENSIVELY WITH

02:39:12.776 --> 02:39:13.644
THEM BUT ALL MEMBERS OF THE

02:39:13.710 --> 02:39:14.711
COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

02:39:14.778 --> 02:39:16.113
HAVE THE TECHNICAL INFORMATION

02:39:16.179 --> 02:39:18.015
THEY NEED AND I'M TO HELP THEM

02:39:18.081 --> 02:39:19.616
IDENTIFY FUNDING SOURCES THAT

02:39:19.683 --> 02:39:21.385
WOULD ALLOW --

02:39:21.451 --> 02:39:23.120
THESE KINDS OF CONSOLIDATIONS TO

02:39:23.186 --> 02:39:24.454
AND IMPROVEMENTS TO OCCUR

02:39:24.521 --> 02:39:24.755
[inaudible]

02:39:24.821 --> 02:39:25.722
MMHM.

02:39:25.789 --> 02:39:28.125
LET'S SAY YOU HAVE.

02:39:28.191 --> 02:39:30.794
THREE HOMES THAT ARE ON SEPTIC.

02:39:30.861 --> 02:39:32.696
AND THERE'S A SEWER SYSTEM RIGHT

02:39:32.763 --> 02:39:34.865
NEXT TO IT AND FOR SOME REASON

02:39:34.932 --> 02:39:35.866
LET'S JUST SAY IT'S JUST THE

02:39:35.933 --> 02:39:38.068
LEGACY THEY JUST WERE NEVER ON

02:39:38.135 --> 02:39:39.736
IT WHEN THE HOUSES NGUYEN IN.

02:39:39.803 --> 02:39:44.574
ITS ITS DEVELOPED AROUND.

02:39:44.641 --> 02:39:45.809
SO WITH THE SEPTIC SERVICE.

02:39:45.876 --> 02:39:48.178
MAINTAINED AND THERE'S NO

02:39:48.245 --> 02:39:51.682
PROBLEM THERE'S NO LEAK.

02:39:51.748 --> 02:39:52.549
FLUSH THEM OUT WHEN THEY WHEN

02:39:52.616 --> 02:39:53.951
THEY NEED TO IN THERE OKAY

02:39:54.017 --> 02:39:55.519
THAT'S ONE FAXES.

02:39:55.585 --> 02:39:57.654
SITUATION LET'S SAY YOU GO THERE

02:39:57.721 --> 02:39:59.456
AND YOU SEE THAT THEY ARE.

02:39:59.523 --> 02:40:01.725
NOT MAINTAINED OVER USE FALL

02:40:01.792 --> 02:40:04.494
APART AND CONTAMINATING THE

02:40:04.561 --> 02:40:06.096
GROUND WATER THAT'S THEIR WHAT

02:40:06.163 --> 02:40:08.966
MUSCLE WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE AND

02:40:09.032 --> 02:40:09.866
IN THE AUTHORITY THAT YOU'VE

02:40:09.933 --> 02:40:12.703
BEEN GIVEN ON TWELVE FIFTEEN

02:40:12.769 --> 02:40:14.638
ORDER.

02:40:14.705 --> 02:40:17.274
THAT'S SEPTIC OUT.

02:40:17.341 --> 02:40:20.143
YOU GET A CONSOLIDATED WITH THE

02:40:20.210 --> 02:40:21.878
WITH THE EXISTING SYSTEM I DON'T

WANT TO SEE SOME CONSOLIDATION

02:40:30.354 --> 02:40:33.123
FOR PUBLIC HEALTH I MEAN I THINK.

02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:34.358
WITH THOSE TWO DIFFERENT

02:40:34.424 --> 02:40:36.059
SCENARIOS.

02:40:36.126 --> 02:40:37.027
RESULT IN DIFFERENT ACTIONS BY

02:40:37.094 --> 02:40:41.431
THE BY THE BOARD.

02:40:41.498 --> 02:40:42.766
YES I I THINK THAT IF WE EVER

02:40:42.833 --> 02:40:44.301
WILL I PREVIOUSLY WE DID NOT

02:40:44.368 --> 02:40:48.472
HAVE THE AUTHORITY ON THE ON THE

02:40:48.538 --> 02:40:50.240
SEWER SERVICE SIDE TO REQUIRE

02:40:50.307 --> 02:40:51.675
MANDATORY --

02:40:51.742 --> 02:40:53.710
CONSOLIDATIONS AND WE WOULD

02:40:53.777 --> 02:40:55.846
OBVIOUSLY TARGET AREAS WHERE WE

02:40:55.912 --> 02:40:57.514
HAD NOT FUNCTIONING --

02:40:57.581 --> 02:41:00.183
SU AD SEPTIC SYSTEMS.

02:41:00.250 --> 02:41:01.518
IT IN CERTAIN AREAS IF THEY ARE

02:41:01.585 --> 02:41:03.053
WELL MAINTAINED AND PROPERLY

02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:04.421
MAINTAIN THEY STILL ARE AND AND

02:41:04.488 --> 02:41:06.023
AND OKAY ALTERNATIVE.

02:41:06.089 --> 02:41:07.157
BUT IF HEY'RE NOT IF THEY

02:41:07.224 --> 02:41:07.791
AREN'T FUNCTIONING AND IF THERE

02:41:07.858 --> 02:41:11.094
IS A LANCE EASILY OR EFFICIENTLY --

02:41:11.161 --> 02:41:13.096
ECONOMICALLY I'M THIS IS NOW A

02:41:13.163 --> 02:41:16.266
TOOL THAT WE HAVE IN OUR TOOLBOX.

02:41:16.333 --> 02:41:17.300
TO BOTH THE EMBERS.

02:41:17.367 --> 02:41:18.802

02:41:18.869 --> 02:41:20.404
WHO HAVE.

02:41:20.470 --> 02:41:21.438
THIS NON FUNCTIONING --

02:41:21.505 --> 02:41:23.206
SEPTIC SYSTEM AND THE BROADER

02:41:23.273 --> 02:41:25.409
PUBLIC HEALTH I MEAN THE THE

02:41:25.475 --> 02:41:28.178
POINT IS SET AT THEY MAY BE FINE

02:41:28.245 --> 02:41:29.913
WITH THE NON FUNCTIONING AS A

02:41:29.980 --> 02:41:31.381
SEPTIC SYSTEM BUT IT'S IT'S

02:41:31.448 --> 02:41:33.617
HAVING ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE

02:41:33.683 --> 02:41:35.585
GROUND WATER IN GENERAL AND CAN

02:41:37.687 --> 02:41:39.156
JUST WANNA.

02:41:39.222 --> 02:41:39.723
OR IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:41:39.790 --> 02:41:41.491
MUSCLE THEN YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE

02:41:41.558 --> 02:41:43.660
HAVE A LARGER CONSOLIDATION GOAL

02:41:43.727 --> 02:41:46.296
HERE OF THE STATUS QUO IS NOT

WITH NOT HAVING A FUNCTIONING

02:42:12.322 --> 02:42:13.557

02:52:19.729 --> 02:52:21.731
APPROPRIATELY THAT IT THAT THERE

02:52:21.798 --> 02:52:22.765
COULD BE AN INCREASE OF

FOREST AND STREAM CHANNEL

02:52:28.938 --> 02:52:30.640

INCREASING EROSION AND POTENTIAL

02:52:34.377 --> 02:52:35.712
SETTLEMENT DISCHARGES TO SCREEN

02:52:35.778 --> 02:52:37.113
STREAMS --

02:52:37.180 --> 02:52:38.948
INCREASE RISK TO DOWNSTREAM

02:52:39.015 --> 02:52:40.516
INFRASTRUCTURE IF THERE ARE

02:52:40.583 --> 02:52:41.584
LANDSLIDES.

02:52:41.651 --> 02:52:43.352
ON THAT COULD AFFECT ROADS AND

02:52:43.419 --> 02:52:44.954
LAND AND WATER CROSSINGS --

02:52:45.021 --> 02:52:46.923
OR RESULT IN JUST THIS CHARGING

02:52:46.989 --> 02:52:48.791

UPSLOPE OF SURFACE WATERS.

02:52:53.396 --> 02:52:54.997
I'M AND AND THAT ANY OF THOSE

02:52:55.064 --> 02:52:57.567
IMPACTS COULD --

02:52:57.633 --> 02:53:00.336
AFFECT BENEFICIAL USES OF STATE

AND THEIR HABITATS --

02:53:07.210 --> 02:53:08.811
INCREASED POTENTIAL FOR ELEVATED

02:53:08.878 --> 02:53:10.446
WATER TEMPERATURES AND RESULT IN

02:53:10.513 --> 02:53:12.181
HUMAN HEALTH RISKS INCLUDING

02:53:12.248 --> 02:53:13.282

LASTING IMPACT THESE ARE

02:58:00.436 --> 02:58:02.138
SUPPOSED TO BE TEMPORARY ROADS.

02:58:02.204 --> 02:58:03.539
THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST GONNA BE A

02:58:03.606 --> 02:58:05.708
LOT OF ACTIVITIES A LOT OF THEM.

02:58:05.775 --> 02:58:09.512
PRESSURE TO DO THEM. TO DO THEM

02:58:09.578 --> 02:58:11.280
SOME I THINK THERE'S SOME COMMON

02:58:11.347 --> 02:58:13.983
SENSE AND RULES OF THE ROAD THE

02:58:14.050 --> 02:58:15.117
RULES OF THE ROAD THAT PEOPLE

WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SOMETIMES

02:58:19.455 --> 02:58:20.089
DOING THINGS --

02:58:20.156 --> 02:58:21.590
FASTER DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

02:58:21.657 --> 02:58:22.892
DOING THEM BETTER AND WE JUST

02:58:22.958 --> 02:58:25.261
WANT TO BE ABLE --

02:58:25.327 --> 02:58:25.528

02:58:25.594 --> 02:58:27.663
THEM.

02:58:27.730 --> 02:58:29.732
A POTENTIAL M. IMPROPER RISKY

02:58:29.799 --> 02:58:31.534
ACTIVITY EARLY ON RATHER THAN

02:58:31.600 --> 02:58:33.202
TRYING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

02:58:33.269 --> 02:58:34.570
SOME INVESTMENTS --

02:58:34.637 --> 02:58:36.739
IN HABITAT RESTORATION THAT HAVE

02:58:36.806 --> 02:58:37.840
BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AND

02:58:37.907 --> 02:58:39.408
YEARS IN SOME OF THESE WATERWAYS

02:58:39.475 --> 02:58:41.177
AND CAN INVOLVE A LOT OF A LOT

02:58:41.243 --> 02:58:43.179
OF MONEY FROM OUR ALL OF OUR

02:58:43.245 --> 02:58:44.146
COLLECTIVE.

02:58:44.213 --> 02:58:45.981
STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS AND

02:58:46.048 --> 02:58:49.151
TRYING TO HAVING TO DO THAT --

02:58:49.218 --> 02:58:51.420
IN OF MITIGATION --

02:58:51.487 --> 02:58:53.389
ACTIVITY.

02:58:53.456 --> 02:58:55.491
AGAIN OR AFTER THE FACT IS IF IF

02:58:55.558 --> 02:58:57.059
WE CAN THROUGH TIMELY

02:58:57.126 --> 02:58:59.662
INSPECTIONS AVOID OR REDUCE --

02:58:59.728 --> 02:59:01.864
OR GET MEDICATION GOING QUICKLY

02:59:01.931 --> 02:59:03.599
I THINK THAT --

02:59:03.666 --> 02:59:04.733
THE LONG TERM INVESTMENT.

02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:08.170
WILL BE PROTECTED AND WE WILL BE

02:59:08.237 --> 02:59:10.039
ABLE TO GO AHEAD AND ALLOW THE

02:59:10.106 --> 02:59:12.241
APPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES TO GO

02:59:12.308 --> 02:59:13.943
PRIOR APPROVAL NORMALLY THIS

02:59:14.009 --> 02:59:15.344
KIND OF ACTIVITY WHICH WOULD

02:59:15.411 --> 02:59:17.213
HAVE BEEN DONE ANA.

02:59:17.279 --> 02:59:17.880
SMALLER SCALE WOULD HAVE

02:59:17.947 --> 02:59:19.548
INVOLVED EITHER WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:59:19.615 --> 02:59:21.617
ALLOWED AT ALL OR WOULD HAVE

02:59:21.684 --> 02:59:22.818
BEEN SUBJECT --

02:59:22.885 --> 02:59:25.154
TO OUR REVIEW HEAD OF TIME SO

02:59:25.221 --> 02:59:27.590
WE'RE SORT OF DOING I'M BACK AND

02:59:27.656 --> 02:59:29.225
ACTIONS THEM.

02:59:29.291 --> 02:59:31.026
BY A GUEST THE OTHER THING IS

02:59:31.093 --> 02:59:32.995
THAT WE CAN JUST LET CAL FIRE

02:59:33.062 --> 02:59:34.663
AND OUR FIRE TRUCKS GO UP.

02:59:34.730 --> 02:59:36.565
AND FIGHT THE FIRE ACT AS YOU'RE

02:59:36.632 --> 02:59:37.666
DOING IT AND JUST DEAL WITH THE

02:59:37.733 --> 02:59:39.535

CONSEQUENCES AND WHAT'S THAT

03:00:11.400 --> 03:00:13.302
COST COULD BE TRIED TO REPAIR

03:00:13.369 --> 03:00:14.970
THAT RIPARIAN WAY --

03:00:15.037 --> 03:00:16.705
SO HERE AT LEAST WE MAY BE

03:00:16.772 --> 03:00:18.340
MOVING FAST BUT YOU KNOW WHAT

03:00:18.407 --> 03:00:20.209
WE'RE WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED

03:00:20.276 --> 03:00:23.812
ABOUT THAT NEXT FIRE AND AND HOW.

03:00:23.879 --> 03:00:25.114
HOW THE?

03:00:25.181 --> 03:00:28.083
WORKS TOGETHER ON THESE ON THESE

03:00:28.150 --> 03:00:30.252
ACTIVITIES BECAUSE WE WANT TO

03:00:30.319 --> 03:00:32.121
LOOK AT WHAT THE HARVEST TO GO

03:00:32.188 --> 03:00:34.023
ON AND IN THAT CREW TO MOVE OVER

03:00:34.089 --> 03:00:35.124
TO THE NEXT.

03:00:35.191 --> 03:00:37.326
ONE AFTER THE OTHER RESOURCES TO

03:00:37.393 --> 03:00:37.626
GO AND SAY.

03:00:37.693 --> 03:00:38.661
WHOOPS.

03:00:38.727 --> 03:00:41.997
WE COMPROMISED THIS RIPARIAN.

03:00:42.064 --> 03:00:44.033
OUT WHERE THE HABITAT.

03:00:44.099 --> 03:00:46.202
FIX THAT.

03:00:46.268 --> 03:00:47.937
THAT'S A DIFFERENT REQUEST.

03:00:48.003 --> 03:00:52.341
SO SO WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT --

03:00:52.408 --> 03:00:54.310
IN THERE WHEN THEREIS WHEN WHEN

03:00:54.376 --> 03:00:55.344
THERE IS A MASSIVE FIRE OR EVEN

03:00:55.411 --> 03:00:59.582
A SMALLER FIRE THAT THERE.

03:00:59.648 --> 03:01:02.418
OFTEN ARE VERY SUBSTANTIAL --

03:01:02.484 --> 03:01:04.186
THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC

03:01:04.253 --> 03:01:07.089
HEALTH I'M CONSEQUENCES AND THAT

03:01:07.156 --> 03:01:08.390
THERE WERE THERE HAPPEN AND IN

03:01:08.457 --> 03:01:10.159
SOME OF OUR RECENT FIRES A LOT

03:01:10.226 --> 03:01:12.361
OF LANDSLIDES AND SEDIMENTATION

03:01:12.428 --> 03:01:14.096
ISSUES AND HARM TO HABITAT AND

03:01:14.163 --> 03:01:15.464
WE'VE.

03:01:15.531 --> 03:01:17.900
HAD TO DO A LOT OF REMEDIATION

03:01:17.967 --> 03:01:19.068
IF WE CAN FIND --

03:01:19.134 --> 03:01:20.736
AND MITIGATION IF WE CAN FIND

03:01:20.803 --> 03:01:22.204
SOME DOLLARS TO DO IT AND A LOT

03:01:22.271 --> 03:01:24.540
OF IT HAS YOU KNOW WE WE AREN'T

03:01:24.607 --> 03:01:26.775
ABLE -- TO

03:01:26.842 --> 03:01:30.346
SO WE'RE NOT AN THAT THIS IS A

03:01:30.412 --> 03:01:31.680
THIS IS A GOOD INVESTMENT IN.

03:01:31.747 --> 03:01:33.349
REDUCING RISK UP FRONT RATHER

03:01:33.415 --> 03:01:34.450
THAN --

03:01:34.516 --> 03:01:35.551
DEALING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF

03:01:35.618 --> 03:01:37.186
A BIG FIRE WE JUST THINK THAT

03:01:37.253 --> 03:01:39.388
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THOSE ARE

03:01:39.455 --> 03:01:41.090
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THAT WE CAN --

03:01:41.156 --> 03:01:43.158
IF IF WE HAVE THIS KIND OF

03:01:43.225 --> 03:01:46.395
SUPPORT TO TRY --

03:01:46.462 --> 03:01:48.197
TO SURE THAT THE THE MEASURES

03:01:48.264 --> 03:01:49.498
THAT DO HAVE SOME IMPACTS ROAD

03:01:49.565 --> 03:01:51.934
ROAD SEGMENTATION OVERALL --

03:01:52.001 --> 03:01:53.435
IF IF THERE'S A LOT OF IT DOES

03:01:53.502 --> 03:01:54.169
HAVE SOME.

03:01:54.236 --> 03:01:56.438
SOME IMPACT AND AND WE CAN JUST

03:01:56.505 --> 03:01:58.307
TRY TO MINIMIZE THAT I'M.

03:01:58.374 --> 03:01:59.908
AS PART OF THIS LARGER FIRE

03:01:59.975 --> 03:02:01.277
SUPPRESSION --

03:02:01.343 --> 03:02:02.978
AND FOREST HEALTH INITIATIVE

03:02:03.045 --> 03:02:04.647
THAT THAT'S A WIN WIN.

03:02:04.713 --> 03:02:06.849
I GUESS THAT THE THE OBVIOUS

03:02:06.915 --> 03:02:08.050
NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE.

03:02:08.117 --> 03:02:09.084
YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH

03:02:09.151 --> 03:02:10.619
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS WERE

03:02:10.686 --> 03:02:13.689
USING THE FUN THAT WE HAVE.

03:02:13.756 --> 03:02:15.791
PREVENTION AND AND THIS IS

03:02:15.858 --> 03:02:17.593
INCLUDED IN THAT UMBRELLA WE

03:02:17.660 --> 03:02:19.194
ALSO HAVE HEALTHY SOILS.

03:02:19.261 --> 03:02:21.130
AND WE HAVE WETLAND REMEDIATION

03:02:21.196 --> 03:02:22.498
WE KNOW THAT WE CAN WE CAN

03:02:22.564 --> 03:02:25.334
IMPROVE WATER RETENTION BY JUST

03:02:25.401 --> 03:02:27.136
BY JUST.

03:02:27.202 --> 03:02:28.437
MAKING SURE THAT THE WATERSHED

03:02:28.504 --> 03:02:29.672
IS SORT OF WORKING THE WAY IT'S

03:02:29.738 --> 03:02:30.973
SUPPOSED TO BE WORK AND I'M NOT

03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:32.207
NOT A 100% --

03:02:32.274 --> 03:02:33.575
I WASN'T EVEN A 100% OR IN

03:02:33.642 --> 03:02:35.511
SCHOOL BUT BUT IF WE COULD GET

03:02:35.577 --> 03:02:37.212
THE WATERSHED SORT OF DOING WHAT

03:02:37.279 --> 03:02:38.080
IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO.

03:02:38.147 --> 03:02:39.715
THAT NATURALLY THE WAY IT'S

03:02:39.782 --> 03:02:43.152
BUILT MONEY INTO DIFFERENT AREAS

03:02:43.218 --> 03:02:44.987
BUT JUST HAVE THE NATURAL

03:02:45.054 --> 03:02:46.889
ENVIRONMENT WORK THE WAY IT'S

03:02:46.955 --> 03:02:47.756
SUPPOSED TO BE OR IN THAT AT

03:02:47.823 --> 03:02:49.925
LEAST HAVE A IDEA THAT THEY

03:02:49.992 --> 03:02:51.293
COULD RECOVER --

03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:55.998
SO BECAUSE THAT IS THE AUCTION

03:02:56.065 --> 03:02:56.298
[inaudible]

03:02:56.365 --> 03:02:57.900
RESULTS.

03:02:57.966 --> 03:02:59.968
MIGHT PROMPT THIS LEGISLATURE TO

03:03:00.035 --> 03:03:01.670
PUT MORE MONEY INTO THIS TYPE OF

03:03:01.737 --> 03:03:02.738
PROGRAM SO.

03:03:02.805 --> 03:03:05.207
IT'S A HEADS UP I GUESS.

03:03:05.274 --> 03:03:06.775
FROM FROM THIS POINT IS THAT WE

03:03:06.842 --> 03:03:08.477
MAY WANT TO SEE MORE OF THIS

03:03:08.544 --> 03:03:09.211

03:10:55.277 --> 03:10:56.912
PLACES NOW.

03:10:56.978 --> 03:10:58.647
RIGHT I GUESS THE COULD THE

03:10:58.713 --> 03:10:59.948
QUESTION IS IS THAT IF YOU.

03:11:00.015 --> 03:11:01.817
THE SOONER YOU MAKE THE SOILS

03:11:01.883 --> 03:11:04.052
HEALTHIER OR START THAT PROCESS

03:11:04.119 --> 03:11:06.087
THE BETTER MORE GREENHOUSE GAS

03:11:06.154 --> 03:11:09.925
REDUCTION MORE PRODUCTIVITY --

03:11:09.991 --> 03:11:11.860
IS IT A PROBLEM OF GETTING.

03:11:11.927 --> 03:11:14.196
FARMERS ARE PEOPLE ARE TO

03:11:14.262 --> 03:11:15.997
PARTICIPATE WITH WITH IT OR IS

03:11:16.064 --> 03:11:19.034
THERE A IS JUST GENERALLY.

03:11:19.100 --> 03:11:20.335
SO YOU'RE WANTING TO KNOW ARE WE

03:11:20.402 --> 03:11:21.436
COMFORTABLE OR WHAT ARE WE

03:11:21.503 --> 03:11:22.637
GETTING DONE WITH WHAT'S BEEN

03:11:22.704 --> 03:11:23.638
ALLOCATED.

03:11:23.705 --> 03:11:25.273
YEAH IT IS A PROCESS WE HAVE TO

03:11:25.340 --> 03:11:27.542
START AND RELIES LARGELY ON

03:11:27.609 --> 03:11:29.277
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.

03:11:29.344 --> 03:11:30.078
IN SOME OF THOSE ARE ON

03:11:30.145 --> 03:11:31.913
INDIVIDUAL FARMS AND IN SOME OF

03:11:31.980 --> 03:11:33.114
THOSE WILL BE COLLECTIVELY WERE

03:11:33.181 --> 03:11:34.616
OTHER GROWERS IN THE AREA COULD

03:11:34.683 --> 03:11:35.784
COME AND VIEW THEM.

03:11:35.851 --> 03:11:39.020
AND PROJECTS THERE RELATE HEALTH

03:11:39.087 --> 03:11:41.022
OF SOILS ARE GENERALLY THINGS

03:11:41.089 --> 03:11:42.891
THAT NEED TO HAPPEN OVER TIME --

03:11:42.958 --> 03:11:44.192
YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME THINGS

03:11:44.259 --> 03:11:46.027
THAT YOU CAN APPLY SAY COMPOST

03:11:46.094 --> 03:11:47.729
MATERIALS MAKES OBSERVATIONS AND

03:11:47.796 --> 03:11:49.130
HAVE MEASURABLE RESULTS.

03:11:49.197 --> 03:11:49.931
BUT THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT

03:11:49.998 --> 03:11:51.233
INVOLVE THE GROWING OF COVER

03:11:51.299 --> 03:11:53.735
CROPS OR SPECIFICALLY ALTERING

03:11:53.802 --> 03:11:56.238
CHIT TILLAGE PRACTICES FROM WHAT

03:11:56.304 --> 03:11:57.472
THEY HAD BEEN LONG STANDING.

03:11:57.539 --> 03:11:58.807
IN MEASURING THOSE RESULTS OVER

03:11:58.874 --> 03:11:59.841
TIME.

03:11:59.908 --> 03:12:02.978
SO YEAH IT IS THIS KIND OF A

03:12:03.044 --> 03:12:03.845
SLOW YOU KNOW FROM THE THE

03:12:03.912 --> 03:12:05.513
PERSPECTIVE OF SOME THINGS YOU

03:12:05.580 --> 03:12:06.882

03:12:06.948 --> 03:12:08.116
CAN SEE IMMEDIATE MEASURABLE

03:12:08.183 --> 03:12:08.717
RESULTS AND SAY THAT'S A GOOD

03:12:08.783 --> 03:12:10.619
PRACTICE.

03:12:10.685 --> 03:12:12.487
SO THIS ONE HERE BECAUSE GROWING

03:12:12.554 --> 03:12:14.489
CYCLES GENERALLY RUN THROUGHOUT

03:12:14.556 --> 03:12:17.559
THE THE SEASONAL PATTERN IT

03:12:17.626 --> 03:12:18.159
TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT

03:12:18.226 --> 03:12:19.594
YEAH WE DO.

THIS OBVIOUSLY AND WE WANT TO

03:12:22.130 --> 03:12:23.865
PLACE THIS MONEY OUT THERE WITH

03:12:23.932 --> 03:12:26.334
PROJECTS THAT ARE TO US GOING TO

03:12:26.401 --> 03:12:28.169
HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF SUCCESS?

03:12:28.236 --> 03:12:29.804
IN A SPECIALLY REPEATABILITY IF

03:12:29.871 --> 03:12:31.373
IT IS A GOOD PRACTICE AND WE CAN

03:12:31.439 --> 03:12:33.541
MEASURE THOSE POSITIVE IMPACTS.

03:12:33.608 --> 03:12:34.643
AND THEN WE CAN GET THAT

03:12:34.709 --> 03:12:35.877
INFORMATION OUT THERE SO THAT

03:12:35.944 --> 03:12:37.245
OTHER GROWERS AND RANCHERS ADOPT

03:12:37.312 --> 03:12:38.980
THOSE PRACTICES AS QUICKLY AS

03:12:39.047 --> 03:12:40.148
THEY CAN BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:12:40.215 --> 03:12:41.583
THE QUICKER THEY ADOPTED IN THE

03:12:41.650 --> 03:12:45.020
MORE WE GET THE OVERALL BIG

03:12:45.086 --> 03:12:47.255
PICTURE RESULT THAT WE'RE AFTER --

03:12:47.322 --> 03:12:49.457

03:13:36.771 --> 03:13:39.541
ANYMORE MILLION ROOM THERE IN

03:13:39.607 --> 03:13:41.242
THE NECROPSY AREA TO HANDLE

03:13:41.309 --> 03:13:43.311
LARGE ANIMAL LIKE A DAIRY COW.

03:13:43.378 --> 03:13:44.446
AND AS YOU'RE AWARE TURLOCK SITS

03:13:44.512 --> 03:13:45.914
IN THE MIDDLE OF JERRY COUNTRY

03:13:45.981 --> 03:13:47.315
SO WE REALLY DO NEED THAT

03:13:47.382 --> 03:13:48.583
CAPACITY SO THIS.

03:13:48.650 --> 03:13:50.919
LAB IS ESSENTIAL FOR US TO HAVE

03:13:50.986 --> 03:13:52.153
THAT PRESENCE --

03:13:52.220 --> 03:13:53.621
BUT IMPORTANT TO KNOW RIGHT NOW

03:13:53.688 --> 03:13:56.057
IN THE TIMES THAT WERE IN THAT

03:13:56.124 --> 03:13:57.359
WE FIND OURSELVES WITH.

03:13:57.425 --> 03:13:59.361
KEEPING THAT LAB CAPACITY GOING

03:13:59.427 --> 03:14:01.062
WERE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A

03:14:01.129 --> 03:14:03.031
VERY VERY BIG EFFORT TO TRY TO

03:14:03.098 --> 03:14:04.099
WRAP A KATE.

03:14:04.165 --> 03:14:05.567
VERY WANT NEWCASTLE DISEASE

03:14:05.633 --> 03:14:07.068
WHICH RIGHT NOW IS MOSTLY IN

03:14:07.135 --> 03:14:08.336
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT AS

03:14:08.403 --> 03:14:09.971
RECENT AS LAST WEEK WE DID HAVE

03:14:10.038 --> 03:14:11.473
A SINGLE FIND UP HERE NORTHERN

03:14:11.539 --> 03:14:12.407
CALIFORNIA.

03:14:12.474 --> 03:14:15.243
WHICH HAS THE PRODUCERS AND THE

03:14:15.310 --> 03:14:16.511
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY VERY EDGY.

03:14:16.578 --> 03:14:17.879
SO IT JUST UNDERSCORES THE

03:14:17.946 --> 03:14:20.749
IMPORTANCE OF THIS LABORATORY

03:14:20.815 --> 03:14:22.550
NETWORK THAT WE MAINTAIN AN TWO

03:14:22.617 --> 03:14:24.319
YEARS AGO THE BUDGET HAD

03:14:24.386 --> 03:14:25.987
ACQUISITION COSTS.

03:14:26.054 --> 03:14:29.724
INCLUDED IN AND THAT IS THIS.

03:14:29.791 --> 03:14:31.292
WRESTLING THESE THAT'S A G. SENT

03:14:31.359 --> 03:14:33.228
TO THE CURRENT FCILITY OR IS

03:14:33.294 --> 03:14:34.829
THIS.

03:14:34.896 --> 03:14:36.731
MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S NOT

03:14:36.798 --> 03:14:39.200
IT'S LOCATED A FEW MILES AWAY.

03:14:39.267 --> 03:14:40.735
BECAUSE ADJACENT I DON'T BELIEVE

03:14:40.802 --> 03:14:42.637
IT HAD THE CAPACITY TO REALLY

03:14:42.704 --> 03:14:45.073
BUILD OUT A LAB [inaudible]

03:14:45.140 --> 03:14:47.509
OKAY -- I'M

03:14:47.575 --> 03:14:49.310
YOU STILL OWN THE PROPERTY ON

03:14:49.377 --> 03:14:50.612
THE CURRENT LAP.

03:14:50.678 --> 03:14:51.880
THE CURRENT YEAH THE CURRENT LAB

03:14:51.946 --> 03:14:53.515
IN THE PROPERTY THERE THOSE VERY

03:14:53.581 --> 03:14:54.916
MINUSCULE.

03:14:54.983 --> 03:14:56.084
FOR WHEN YOU COMPARE TO THIS LAB

03:14:56.151 --> 03:14:57.786
OR GOING FROM ABOUT FIFTY ONE

03:14:57.852 --> 03:14:59.687
HUNDRED SQUARE FEET ABOUT FORTY

03:14:59.754 --> 03:15:01.456
ONE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET.

03:15:01.523 --> 03:15:04.626
SO IT WILL BE [inaudible]

03:15:04.692 --> 03:15:08.930
WE APPROVE THE REQUEST.

03:15:08.997 --> 03:15:11.266
AND WE GO INTO THE DESIGN BUILD

03:15:11.332 --> 03:15:13.001
PROCESS HE GETS DONE WHAT DO YOU

03:15:13.068 --> 03:15:15.170
SEE HAPPENING WITH A FIFTY ONE

03:15:15.236 --> 03:15:19.240
FOOT FACILITY DECEPTICON --

03:15:19.307 --> 03:15:21.976
AVIAN SPECIES FACILITY IS GET

03:15:22.043 --> 03:15:26.047

WILL FOCUS ON FIGHTING BOTH THE

03:22:59.967 --> 03:23:01.836
ASIAN CITRUS PSYLLID AND THE

03:23:01.903 --> 03:23:04.605
RESULTANT DISEASE LONG LONG BANG.

03:23:04.672 --> 03:23:05.473
AND SO.

03:23:05.540 --> 03:23:06.841
THE CURRENT EFFORT RIGHT NOW

03:23:06.908 --> 03:23:09.744
EXIST PRIMARILY WITHIN ONE MAJOR

03:23:09.810 --> 03:23:10.811
LARGE --

03:23:10.878 --> 03:23:12.280
BRANCH WITHIN OUR CURRENT

03:23:12.346 --> 03:23:14.248
DIVISION OF PLANT HILLS AND PEST

03:23:14.315 --> 03:23:15.550

SOME RESOURCES THAT OF BECOME

03:23:24.091 --> 03:23:26.294
SOMEWHAT DEDICATED OVER THE PAST

03:23:26.360 --> 03:23:27.929
FEW YEARS IN THIS EFFORT.

03:23:27.995 --> 03:23:29.397
AND PULL THEM INTO AN

03:23:29.463 --> 03:23:30.798
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT

03:23:30.865 --> 03:23:33.601
WILL BE FOCUSED SINGULARLY ON

03:23:33.668 --> 03:23:34.735
THESE -- TWO

03:23:34.802 --> 03:23:35.970
CITRUS THREAT HERE.

03:23:36.037 --> 03:23:37.204
AND WE THINK THAT THAT'S GOING

03:23:37.271 --> 03:23:39.507
TO HELP US OPERATE IT'S GOING TO

03:23:39.574 --> 03:23:41.642
KEEP THE FOCUS THE TRAINING THE

03:23:41.709 --> 03:23:43.544
LOCATION OF THE STAFF IN AREAS

03:23:43.611 --> 03:23:44.946
WHERE THEY CAN RESPOND REALLY

03:23:45.012 --> 03:23:46.514
QUICKLY TO NEW DETECTIONS.

03:23:46.581 --> 03:23:48.549
AND ALSO TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND

03:23:48.616 --> 03:23:50.718
AND ENHANCE EXISTING WORK THAT

03:23:50.785 --> 03:23:52.353
NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA.

03:23:52.420 --> 03:23:54.889
AND SIMILARLY SPEAKING THEN IT

03:23:54.956 --> 03:23:57.858
FREES UP SOME OF THAT FROM OUR

03:23:57.925 --> 03:23:59.460
EXISTING DIVISION THAT HAS

03:23:59.527 --> 03:24:01.762
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL TYPES OF

03:24:01.829 --> 03:24:03.331
RESPONSES NECESSARY WHEN THERE'S

03:24:03.397 --> 03:24:04.966
A PEST DETECTION SUCH AS MED FLY

03:24:05.032 --> 03:24:06.534
ORIENTAL FRUIT FLYER.

03:24:06.601 --> 03:24:08.536
IN ASIAN GYPSY MOTH OR THINGS

03:24:08.603 --> 03:24:09.203
LIKE THAT.

03:24:09.270 --> 03:24:11.305
SO WE FEEL OPERATIONALLY THAT --

03:24:11.372 --> 03:24:13.574
THIS IS.

03:24:13.641 --> 03:24:14.809
THE RIGHT TIME IN THE RIGHT WAY

03:24:14.875 --> 03:24:16.944
TO DO THIS.

03:24:17.011 --> 03:24:17.645
LA -- DO YOU

03:24:17.712 --> 03:24:19.380
HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT WHY SEVEN

03:24:19.447 --> 03:24:20.548
POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IS

03:24:20.615 --> 03:24:22.016
LEFT OVER FROM THIS CURRENT

03:24:22.083 --> 03:24:23.351
YEAR'S BUDGET WE WE DID

03:24:23.417 --> 03:24:24.919
RECOMMEND THAT YOU ASK ASK THAT

03:24:24.986 --> 03:24:26.153
QUESTION ALONG WITH SEVERAL

03:24:26.220 --> 03:24:27.688
OTHERS THAT ARE NOTED IN THE

03:24:27.755 --> 03:24:28.522
AGENDA.

03:24:28.589 --> 03:24:30.591
AND BUT WE ARE RECOMMENDING

03:24:30.658 --> 03:24:33.527
APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL --

03:24:33.594 --> 03:24:34.929
GIVEN THE RECENT SPREAD OF ASIAN

03:24:34.996 --> 03:24:37.098
CITRUS SELIGMAN LONG BEING AND

03:24:37.164 --> 03:24:38.399
THAT -- FACT

03:24:38.466 --> 03:24:40.434
THAT AIDS IS CONTINUES TO SPREAD

03:24:40.501 --> 03:24:42.403
A SHOWN BY SOME OF THE GRAPHICS

03:24:42.470 --> 03:24:43.738
IN YOUR IN YOUR AGENDA.

03:24:43.804 --> 03:24:45.172
WE THINK THIS REQUEST FOR

03:24:45.239 --> 03:24:47.475
ADDITIONAL STAFF AND IT'S A

03:24:47.541 --> 03:24:48.976
DIVISION IS REASONABLE.

03:24:49.043 --> 03:24:50.344
SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE

03:24:50.411 --> 03:24:51.212
DEPARTMENT.

03:24:51.278 --> 03:24:53.381
WE GOT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION

03:24:53.447 --> 03:24:55.816
IN FEDERAL FUNDS IN THREE POINT.

03:24:55.883 --> 03:24:57.051
EIGHT NINE MILLION IN STATE

03:24:57.118 --> 03:24:58.686
FUNDS FROM THIS BUDGET THAT

03:24:58.753 --> 03:24:59.553
YOU'RE NOT GETTING.

03:24:59.620 --> 03:25:02.857
DON'T EXPECT TO EXHAUST.

03:25:02.923 --> 03:25:04.625
ON THE GENERAL FUND SIDE YES

03:25:04.692 --> 03:25:06.894
THAT IS CORRECT WE GOT A ONE

03:25:06.961 --> 03:25:08.996
TIME INFUSION --

03:25:09.063 --> 03:25:09.897
FOR THE CURRENT YEAR OF TEN

03:25:09.964 --> 03:25:10.598
MILLION DOLLARS.

03:25:10.665 --> 03:25:14.001
AND IT WAS ALWAYS GET A LARGE

03:25:14.068 --> 03:25:15.369
INFUSION LIKED OUT OF ONE TIME

03:25:15.436 --> 03:25:17.571
DOLLARS TO EFFECTIVELY SPEND IT --

03:25:17.638 --> 03:25:19.306
BECAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT

03:25:19.373 --> 03:25:20.307
TO LEAN TOWARDS PERMANENT

03:25:20.374 --> 03:25:22.043
POSITIONS THAT MAY BE LEFT ON

03:25:22.109 --> 03:25:23.611
FUNDED IN FUTURE YEARS.

03:25:23.678 --> 03:25:24.879
AND SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO FOCUS

03:25:24.945 --> 03:25:26.380
IN ON EFFORTS TO COULD BE ONE

03:25:26.447 --> 03:25:27.648
TIME IN NATURE --

03:25:27.715 --> 03:25:28.916
HOWEVER WE DID PUT THE MONEY

03:25:28.983 --> 03:25:30.051
WHERE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

03:25:30.117 --> 03:25:31.452
MOST EFFECTIVE.

03:25:31.519 --> 03:25:33.154
AND AS WE SPEAK THIS CURRENT

03:25:33.220 --> 03:25:34.822
FISCAL YEAR WE'VE COME A LONG

03:25:34.889 --> 03:25:36.257
WAYS AND WE'RE STILL GONNA MAKE

03:25:36.323 --> 03:25:38.492
PROGRESS ON THE CERTAIN CHANGES

03:25:38.559 --> 03:25:40.061
IN OUR LAB PROTOCOLS IN THE WAY

03:25:40.127 --> 03:25:41.395
WE HANDLE SAMPLES AND WE'RE

03:25:41.462 --> 03:25:42.663
INCREASING OUR THROUGHPUT TO BE

03:25:42.730 --> 03:25:43.464
ABLE TO PROCESS SOME OF THE

03:25:43.531 --> 03:25:44.865
SAMPLES THAT COME IN OUT.

03:25:44.932 --> 03:25:46.200
OF THE FIELD SO THAT GOING

03:25:46.267 --> 03:25:48.102
FORWARD IN THE FUTURE WE CAN

03:25:48.169 --> 03:25:49.570
HIRE MORE PERMANENT STAFF TO

03:25:49.637 --> 03:25:51.305
COLLECTED DO MORE SAMPLING WORK

03:25:51.372 --> 03:25:52.573
CAN BE ABLE TO HANDLETHOSE

03:25:52.640 --> 03:25:53.941
WITHOUT CREATING BOTTLENECKS AT

03:25:54.008 --> 03:25:54.809
THE LAB.

03:25:54.875 --> 03:25:57.278
THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT

03:25:57.344 --> 03:25:57.912
WE'RE DOING SO WE KNOW PART OF

03:25:57.978 --> 03:25:58.946
THIS.

03:25:59.013 --> 03:26:01.982
REVOCATION PROCESS IS GETTING

03:26:02.049 --> 03:26:04.685
INTO THE PROPERTIES OF FOLKS IS

03:26:04.752 --> 03:26:05.953
NOT THE COMMERCIAL.

03:26:06.020 --> 03:26:08.355
OUR FRUIT PEOPLE THIS IS THE THE

03:26:08.422 --> 03:26:09.156
THE GUY WITH AN ORANGE TREE IN

03:26:09.223 --> 03:26:12.626
HIS I HIS BACKYARD AND I KNOW

03:26:12.693 --> 03:26:13.861
FROM LAST YEAR'S HEARING HERE

03:26:13.928 --> 03:26:16.931
BEFORE THERE WAS A PROBLEM OF OF

03:26:16.997 --> 03:26:18.966
GETTING ACCESS TO PEOPLE'S HOUSE.

03:26:19.033 --> 03:26:20.768
AND AND DEALING WITH

03:26:20.835 --> 03:26:21.068
[inaudible]

03:26:21.135 --> 03:26:26.474
THE THE DETECTION AN ERADICATION.

03:26:26.540 --> 03:26:28.809
YEAH THOSE WILL ALWAYS BE

03:26:28.876 --> 03:26:30.344
ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM THAT WILL.

03:26:30.411 --> 03:26:31.278
HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH INNER

03:26:31.345 --> 03:26:32.880
CHALLENGES WE THINK WE'RE DOING

A REALLY GOOD JOB WE A LOT OF

03:26:34.849 --> 03:26:35.983

WE CAN RESPOND TO IT AND YES IT

03:26:53.134 --> 03:26:54.001
DOES --

03:26:54.068 --> 03:26:56.137
RESULT IN ABATEMENT OF THAT TREE

03:26:56.203 --> 03:26:57.538
WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE.

03:26:57.605 --> 03:26:58.739

03:33:01.168 --> 03:33:02.870
TO THAT.

03:33:02.936 --> 03:33:05.005
WE HAD A VCP TWO YEARS AGO THAT

03:33:05.072 --> 03:33:06.306
WAS A FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE ONE

03:33:06.373 --> 03:33:07.641
FAR PAST PREVENTION SYSTEM IN AN

03:33:07.708 --> 03:33:10.144
INCLUDED ABOUT SIX POSITIONS AND

03:33:10.210 --> 03:33:12.346
SOME DEDICATED DOLLARS. FOR

03:33:12.412 --> 03:33:14.648
BEEFING UP OUR ABILITY TO

OPERATE.

03:33:16.283 --> 03:33:17.718
ALMOST TWO HISTORICAL LEVELS FOR

03:33:17.784 --> 03:33:19.586
INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT WE

03:33:19.653 --> 03:33:21.021
HAVE A BRANCH WITHIN OUR PLAN

03:33:21.088 --> 03:33:22.322
HEALTH AND PEST PREVENTION

03:33:22.389 --> 03:33:23.524
DIVISION.

03:33:23.590 --> 03:33:24.424
THAT IS CALLED THE INTEGRATED

03:33:24.491 --> 03:33:26.260
PEST CONTROL AND THAT'S WHAT

03:33:26.326 --> 03:33:27.961
THEIR FOCUS SAYS SO YEAH THAT IS

03:33:28.028 --> 03:33:29.963
DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT AS

03:33:30.030 --> 03:33:31.198
PART OF OUR PORTFOLIO.

03:33:31.265 --> 03:33:33.167
AND TO THAT END WE ALSO HAVE

03:33:33.233 --> 03:33:35.302

ASIAN CITRUCEL IT'S --

03:33:41.575 --> 03:33:44.411
IT'S A TECHNIQUE THAT PROBABLY A

03:33:44.478 --> 03:33:46.380
LOT MORE MATURITY BEFORE IT CAN

03:33:46.446 --> 03:33:48.148
BE CONSIDERED MORE EFFICACIOUS

03:33:48.215 --> 03:33:50.217
ON A LARGER SCALE BUT EVERYTHING

03:33:50.284 --> 03:33:52.186

OF TECHNIQUES AND I APPRECIATE

03:33:56.390 --> 03:33:57.691
THAT I'M ALSO CURIOUS IS

IT WASN'T A REDUCTION TO ZERO AS

03:38:25.425 --> 03:38:26.927
A REDUCTION TO FIVE BECAUSE WE

03:38:26.993 --> 03:38:29.129
STILL HAVE A SMALL PROGRAM.

03:38:29.196 --> 03:38:30.997
THAT PERFORMS A SERVICE FOR THE

03:38:31.064 --> 03:38:32.098
CALIFORNIA AIR INDUSTRY AND

03:38:32.165 --> 03:38:33.099

03:38:43.376 --> 03:38:43.910
FOR SCRUTINY I GUESS YOU COULD

03:38:43.977 --> 03:38:44.678
SAY.

03:38:44.744 --> 03:38:45.645
THE FIRST ONE UP IS MOUNTAIN

03:38:45.712 --> 03:38:47.881
PASS BORDER PROTECTION STATION

03:38:47.948 --> 03:38:49.382
OPERATION EXPANSIONS.

03:38:49.449 --> 03:38:51.384
AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE

03:38:51.451 --> 03:38:52.419
SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR

03:38:52.486 --> 03:38:53.353
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND

03:38:53.420 --> 03:38:55.388
IN EIGHT POSITIONS IN NINETEEN

03:38:55.455 --> 03:38:56.490
TWENTY AN ON GOING.

03:38:56.556 --> 03:38:57.591
WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO IS HELP

03:38:57.657 --> 03:38:59.826
US TO OPEN UP ADDITIONAL LANES

03:38:59.893 --> 03:39:01.294
AT MOUNTAIN PASS BORDER PROTECT?

03:39:01.361 --> 03:39:03.363
CIVILITY THAT'S A RELATIVELY NEW

03:39:03.430 --> 03:39:05.465
FACILITY I A REPLACED AN OLDER

03:39:05.532 --> 03:39:07.033
FACILITY THAT WAS VERY AN

03:39:07.100 --> 03:39:08.969
ADEQUATE AND IT'S A MUCH LARGER

03:39:09.035 --> 03:39:10.103
FACILITY.

03:39:10.170 --> 03:39:11.238
AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE'VE

03:39:11.304 --> 03:39:13.340
OPERATED IF WITH THE EXISTING

03:39:13.406 --> 03:39:15.542
OPERATIONS STAFF THAT WE HAD

03:39:15.609 --> 03:39:16.610
THAT THAT'S NOT AN ADDED

03:39:16.676 --> 03:39:19.980
ADEQUATE TO KEEP THE LANES OPEN.

03:39:20.046 --> 03:39:22.048
OR IDEALLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS A

03:39:22.115 --> 03:39:24.684
DAY ON ALL LANES BUT WE REALIZED

03:39:24.751 --> 03:39:25.886
THAT YOU REALLY DON'T NEED THAT --

03:39:25.952 --> 03:39:27.587
WE TRY TO KEEP ALL LANES OPEN

03:39:27.654 --> 03:39:29.089
DURING WHAT WE ANTICIPATE TO BE

03:39:29.155 --> 03:39:30.590
HEAVY PEAK PERIODS.

03:39:30.657 --> 03:39:32.759
BUT WILL WERE NOTICING AS IS

03:39:32.826 --> 03:39:33.360
THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHERE WE

03:39:33.426 --> 03:39:37.197
JUST. TO KEEP SOME LANES OPENED

03:39:37.264 --> 03:39:38.732
FOR ADDITIONAL HOURS.

03:39:38.798 --> 03:39:41.067
AND SO IT'S JUST BECOME A

03:39:41.134 --> 03:39:43.503
MANAGEMENT --

03:39:43.570 --> 03:39:45.405
IT SURE CHALLENGE FOR US TO

03:39:45.472 --> 03:39:48.008
PLACE PEOPLE ON SHIPS AT TIMES --

03:39:48.074 --> 03:39:48.975
WE KNOW THE TRAFFIC'S GOING TO

03:39:49.042 --> 03:39:50.510
BE PEAK AND WE THINK THAT THESE

03:39:50.577 --> 03:39:52.212
EIGHT POSITIONS AN EXTRA MONEY

03:39:52.279 --> 03:39:54.080
WILL HELP US TO BETTER MANAGE

03:39:54.147 --> 03:39:55.916
THAT SITUATION. TWO THINGS WE

03:39:55.982 --> 03:39:57.150
WANT TO AVOID WANT AVOID THE

03:39:57.217 --> 03:39:58.051
BACK UPS.

03:39:58.118 --> 03:39:59.119
BECAUSE A BACK UP TO A PUBLIC

03:39:59.185 --> 03:40:00.987
SAFETY ISSUE BUT ALSO WITH THE

03:40:01.054 --> 03:40:03.023
BACKUP TO DO OVER TIME IS IS IT

03:40:03.089 --> 03:40:04.190
IN SENSE.

03:40:04.257 --> 03:40:05.525
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO JUST GET

03:40:05.592 --> 03:40:06.960
AROUND AND NOT EXPERIENCE THAT

03:40:07.027 --> 03:40:08.562
BACK UP TO TRY TO BY PASS THAT

03:40:08.628 --> 03:40:09.529
STATION.

03:40:09.596 --> 03:40:10.630
AND THEN THE DEFEATS THE WHOLE

03:40:10.697 --> 03:40:13.366
PURPOSE OF HAVING THE STATE FORM

03:40:13.433 --> 03:40:14.034
THE INSPECTIONS THAT WE NEED TO

03:40:14.100 --> 03:40:14.801
DO.

03:40:14.868 --> 03:40:17.671
OR WHEN CHP SAYS PUBLIC SAFETY

03:40:17.737 --> 03:40:19.306
YEAH WERE VERY SENSITIVE IS THAT

03:40:19.372 --> 03:40:20.240
LIKE SAFETY ISSUE --

03:40:20.307 --> 03:40:21.708
WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY TELL US

03:40:21.775 --> 03:40:22.909
THAT WE JUST HAVE TO START

03:40:22.976 --> 03:40:24.344
WAVING ALL TRAFFIC THROUGH WHICH

03:40:24.411 --> 03:40:25.745
THEIR AGAIN COMPROMISE OUR

03:40:25.812 --> 03:40:27.280
ABILITY TO DO A PROPER

03:40:27.347 --> 03:40:30.517
INSPECTION?

03:40:30.584 --> 03:40:31.885
ALL RIGHT IN EVEN WITH THE

03:40:31.952 --> 03:40:33.853
ADDITIONAL STAFF MEMBER THIS IS

03:40:33.920 --> 03:40:36.489
SAID AT A CHALLENGED.

03:40:36.556 --> 03:40:39.559
SPOT ON THE I'VE.

03:40:39.626 --> 03:40:40.193
FIFTEEN IT IS THE BEST A

03:40:40.260 --> 03:40:41.728
CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE TRAFFIC

03:40:41.795 --> 03:40:43.530
PATTERN THERE IS INCREASED QUITE

03:40:43.597 --> 03:40:44.397
A BIT.

03:40:44.464 --> 03:40:46.099
WE GET OVER ONE POINT THREE

03:40:46.166 --> 03:40:47.934
MILLION VEHICLES IN A THOUSAND

03:40:48.001 --> 03:40:49.102
BOTH SAID TRAVEL THROUGH THERE

03:40:49.169 --> 03:40:50.604
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LAST

03:40:50.670 --> 03:40:52.539
QUARTER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN

03:40:52.606 --> 03:40:53.640
LOOKING AT NUMBERS THERE.

03:40:53.707 --> 03:40:55.241
THOUGH IT GETS AN UNUSUAL LOT OF

03:40:55.308 --> 03:40:58.545
TRAFFIC AND I MENTION BOATS.

03:40:58.612 --> 03:41:00.113
WATER MUSCLE INSPECTIONS FOR

03:41:00.180 --> 03:41:02.449
FISH AND WILDLIFE THERE.

03:41:02.515 --> 03:41:04.017
SO THESEINSPECTIONS A LOT MORE

03:41:04.084 --> 03:41:05.685
THAN JUST LOOK FOR BUGS

03:41:05.752 --> 03:41:06.219
EVERYBODY ALLS ON THE BUG

03:41:06.286 --> 03:41:08.755
STATIONS BUT WE PERFORM A LOT OF

03:41:08.822 --> 03:41:10.690
WORK FOR OTHER AGENCIES AT THESE.

03:41:10.757 --> 03:41:12.325
OR PROTECTION STATIONS AS WELL.

03:41:12.392 --> 03:41:14.094
WE HAVE.

03:41:14.160 --> 03:41:16.329
YEAH WELL AS A CROSS STATE LINES

03:41:16.396 --> 03:41:19.232
SOME OF THE BOATS HAVE THOSE

03:41:19.299 --> 03:41:19.532
[inaudible]

03:41:19.599 --> 03:41:21.501

03:41:24.137 --> 03:41:25.338
ARE PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA.

03:41:25.405 --> 03:41:26.773
AND THEY COULD BE EASILY

03:41:26.840 --> 03:41:28.141
TRANSPORTED ON BOATS THAT --

03:41:28.208 --> 03:41:29.442
RECREATIONAL BOATS COMING IN

03:41:29.509 --> 03:41:31.211

03:48:48.815 --> 03:48:50.683
CRITICAL STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES

IN OUR HAWAII FRUIT FLY REARING

03:48:51.918 --> 03:48:53.119

MAXIMUM PRODUCTIVITY WE NEED TO

03:49:04.897 --> 03:49:06.933
HAVE CLIMATE CONTROL TO BE VERY

03:49:06.999 --> 03:49:08.401
OPERABLE AND WE CAN'T HOW

03:49:08.468 --> 03:49:09.135
FLUCTUATIONS IN THE OLD

03:49:11.204 --> 03:49:12.171
IT SHOULD BE.

03:49:12.238 --> 03:49:13.706
AND IF WE HAVE TO WATER

03:49:13.773 --> 03:49:16.375
TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS THEN IT.

03:49:16.442 --> 03:49:18.678
CUTS DOWN ON OUR REARING

03:49:18.744 --> 03:49:19.879
CAPACITY.

03:49:19.946 --> 03:49:21.747
AND THAT'S AN INTEGRAL PART OF A

03:49:21.814 --> 03:49:22.982
TECHNIQUE THAT WE USE DOWN IN

03:49:23.049 --> 03:49:24.183
THE LA BASIN WHERE WE WERE.

03:49:24.250 --> 03:49:25.885

IN THE BASIN SO THAT THEY CAN

03:49:29.822 --> 03:49:31.057
ACT AS MEETING DISRUPTORS THERE.

03:49:31.124 --> 03:49:32.158
THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE

03:49:32.225 --> 03:49:36.729
NATURAL STE.

03:49:36.796 --> 03:49:38.598

03:49:40.133 --> 03:49:41.801
WE'VE INVESTED A SUBSTANTIAL

03:49:41.868 --> 03:49:43.202
AMOUNT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE

LAST TWO YEARS FIXING THE ROOF

THERE WAS A AGING ROUGH AND WE

03:49:46.606 --> 03:49:48.007
GOT ALL THAT FIX BECAUSE WE HAD

03:49:48.074 --> 03:49:49.942

03:49:50.009 --> 03:49:50.676
THERE.

03:49:50.743 --> 03:49:51.777
AND SO THIS MONEY WILL GO

03:49:51.844 --> 03:49:53.446
TOWARDS ALL THE THINGS BELOW THE

03:49:53.513 --> 03:49:55.281

ADEQUATELY AND THINGS LIKE THAT

03:50:18.804 --> 03:50:19.472

THE STATE.

03:58:41.607 --> 03:58:43.609
THIS IS AN URBAN SUBURBAN AND

TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR FEE

04:00:37.623 --> 04:00:39.258
COLLECTION --

04:00:39.324 --> 04:00:40.559
ONE OF THEM IS ON JERRY

04:00:40.626 --> 04:00:41.693
PRODUCTION.

04:00:41.760 --> 04:00:43.195
AND AS I MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER

04:00:43.262 --> 04:00:44.329
COMPONENT OF THIS HEARING WERE

04:00:44.396 --> 04:00:45.898
ALREADY INVOLVED IN THAT SO WE

04:00:45.964 --> 04:00:47.166
WOULD JUST HAVE ADDITIONAL STAFF

04:00:47.232 --> 04:00:48.300
THAT WOULD HELP US COLLECT THE

04:00:48.367 --> 04:00:50.335
FEES NECESSARY THAT'S CONTAINED

04:00:50.402 --> 04:00:51.703
IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE.

04:00:51.770 --> 04:00:52.971
AND THEN ALSO TO COLLECT A FEE

04:00:53.038 --> 04:00:55.240
ON FERTILIZER IN CALIFORNIA AND

04:00:55.307 --> 04:00:56.708
THERE AGAIN WE ALREADY DO SOME

04:00:56.775 --> 04:00:58.076
WORK IN THAT AREA AND COLLECT

04:00:58.143 --> 04:00:59.311
WHAT'S CALLED A MILL FEE THERE.

04:00:59.378 --> 04:01:00.412
AND SO WE WOULD JUST ADD

04:01:00.479 --> 04:01:01.647
EXISTING STAFF AND DO A LITTLE

04:01:01.713 --> 04:01:03.315
BIT ABOUT FRONT DATABASE WORK TO

04:01:03.382 --> 04:01:04.783
HELP US DO THAT.

04:01:04.850 --> 04:01:05.651
THE CONFINED ANIMAL FEEDING

04:01:05.717 --> 04:01:07.586
OPERATION FEE THAT'S BEEN

04:01:07.653 --> 04:01:09.354
PROPOSING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGES

04:01:09.421 --> 04:01:11.056
AS YET UNSPECIFIED.

04:01:11.123 --> 04:01:12.891
BUT WE WOULD AS THE LANGUAGE

04:01:12.958 --> 04:01:16.528
STATES WE WOULD EXPERTISE TO

04:01:16.595 --> 04:01:17.896
FACILITATE THAT SO THAT WE COULD

04:01:17.963 --> 04:01:19.598
DETERMINE WHAT THOSE FEES SHOULD

04:01:19.665 --> 04:01:20.132
BE AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE

04:01:20.199 --> 04:01:22.835
APPLIED [inaudible]

04:01:22.901 --> 04:01:26.171
OKAY --

04:01:26.238 --> 04:01:28.173
HELLO WHAT'S YOUR COMMENT SIMON

04:01:28.240 --> 04:01:29.708
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

04:01:29.775 --> 04:01:31.743
AND WE HAD A NUMBER OF COMMENTS

04:01:31.810 --> 04:01:33.612
FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION.

04:01:33.679 --> 04:01:35.414
A FIRST IS UNCERTAIN EXTENT TO

04:01:35.480 --> 04:01:36.648
WHICH THE PROPOSE REVENUES WOULD

04:01:36.715 --> 04:01:37.950
FULLY --

04:01:38.016 --> 04:01:39.551
ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THE

04:01:39.618 --> 04:01:40.919
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT COMPLETED

04:01:40.986 --> 04:01:42.888
AN ESTIMATE OF THE TOTAL COSTS

04:01:42.955 --> 04:01:44.389
ASSOCIATED WITH BRINGING

04:01:44.456 --> 04:01:45.490
DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS.

04:01:45.557 --> 04:01:46.892
THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO

04:01:46.959 --> 04:01:48.227
MEET WATER QUALITY STANDARDS IN

04:01:48.293 --> 04:01:49.695
THE COMPLIANCE ON AN ONGOING

04:01:49.761 --> 04:01:50.863
BASIS.

04:01:50.929 --> 04:01:51.997
THE STATE WATER RESOURCES

04:01:52.064 --> 04:01:53.298
CONTROL BOARD IS CURRENTLY

04:01:53.365 --> 04:01:54.933
CONDUCTING A STUDY IT WAS --

04:01:55.000 --> 04:01:57.636
STARTED LAST FALL HOWEVER.

04:01:57.703 --> 04:01:59.304
IT'S NOT EXPECTED TO BE

04:01:59.371 --> 04:02:02.174
COMPLETED IN TELL THE FALL OF

04:02:02.241 --> 04:02:02.808
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY HOWEVER WE

04:02:02.875 --> 04:02:05.210
NOTED THAT THE BOARD HAS STATED

04:02:05.277 --> 04:02:06.178
THAT THEY THINK PARTS OF THE

04:02:06.245 --> 04:02:08.747
STUDY MAY BE AVAILABLE SOONER.

04:02:08.814 --> 04:02:10.816
ON IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT STUDY

04:02:10.883 --> 04:02:12.384
WE MET AT A PRIVATE CONSULTING

04:02:12.451 --> 04:02:14.453
FIRM ESTIMATED THE TOTAL COST

04:02:14.519 --> 04:02:15.888
ADDRESSING INTIMIDATED DRINKING

04:02:15.954 --> 04:02:16.622
WATER.

04:02:16.688 --> 04:02:18.056
AT ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND FORTY

04:02:18.123 --> 04:02:20.158
MILLION HOWEVER THIS THIS

04:02:20.225 --> 04:02:21.360
ESTIMATE IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN

04:02:21.426 --> 04:02:22.628
GIVEN THE LACK OF DATA

04:02:22.694 --> 04:02:23.829
ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE NUMBER

04:02:23.896 --> 04:02:25.831
SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AND WELLS

04:02:25.898 --> 04:02:27.065
THAT FAILED TO PROVIDE SAFE

04:02:27.132 --> 04:02:28.100
DRINKING WATER.

04:02:28.166 --> 04:02:29.067
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

04:02:29.134 --> 04:02:31.737
ACTUAL COSTS COULD BE HIGHER OR

04:02:31.803 --> 04:02:35.807
LOWER THAN THE HUNDRED FORTY

04:02:35.874 --> 04:02:37.809
MILLION DOLLARS.

04:02:37.876 --> 04:02:40.279
I GUESS I GUESS ON IT FOR ASKING

04:02:40.345 --> 04:02:41.446
THE WHOLE PUBLIC TO PAY IN WITH.

04:02:41.513 --> 04:02:42.514
EXCEPT THE THE MORAL

04:02:42.581 --> 04:02:43.615
RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL

04:02:43.682 --> 04:02:46.518
CALIFORNIANS ISN'T PART OF IT ON

04:02:46.585 --> 04:02:50.322
THE COOPERATION THAT WE GET FROM

04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:52.524
THE SMALL FAILING --

04:02:52.591 --> 04:02:54.026
THE DISTRICTS MOVED TO SET ASIDE

04:02:54.092 --> 04:02:57.396
THE WAY LESSEN FOURTEEN HOT CUPS

04:02:57.462 --> 04:02:58.463
WHICH WE DON'T HAVE.

04:02:58.530 --> 04:02:59.932
WHICH IS ANOTHER PROBLEM BUT

04:02:59.998 --> 04:03:02.367
JUST LOOK AT THE IDENTIFIABLE

04:03:02.434 --> 04:03:04.603
SMALL SYSTEMS THAT ARE WORKING

04:03:04.670 --> 04:03:06.905
IF THERE'S MONEY THERE TO

04:03:06.972 --> 04:03:09.041
CONSOLIDATE.

04:03:09.107 --> 04:03:14.212
OR TO OR TO JOIN THE SYSTEM IF

04:03:14.279 --> 04:03:15.981
THERE COOPERATIVE OF THAT IT'S

04:03:16.048 --> 04:03:18.951
GOT A SAVE MONEY RIGHT I MEAN.

04:03:19.017 --> 04:03:20.419
IF THEY WANT TO FIGHT AS BECAUSE

04:03:20.485 --> 04:03:21.853
THEY WANT TO BE SELF DETERMINED

04:03:21.920 --> 04:03:23.121
AND BUT WHATEVER THEY'VE BEEN

04:03:23.188 --> 04:03:25.057
SAYING FOR YEARS THAT SEEMS TO

04:03:25.123 --> 04:03:25.891
BE THAT.

04:03:25.958 --> 04:03:29.394
A BIG SWING OF OF HOW MUCH MONEY

04:03:29.461 --> 04:03:30.929
IS GOING TO BE SPENT WOULD YOU.

04:03:30.996 --> 04:03:34.333
AGREE WITH THAT.

04:03:34.399 --> 04:03:35.634
WELL FIRST OF OUR UNDERSTANDING

04:03:35.701 --> 04:03:38.036
IS THAT WHEREVER POSSIBLE THE

04:03:38.103 --> 04:03:39.438
STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL

04:03:39.504 --> 04:03:41.873
BOARD LOOKS AT OPPORTUNITIES TO

04:03:41.940 --> 04:03:44.609
CONSOLIDATE WATER SYSTEMS AND IF

04:03:44.676 --> 04:03:47.546
THAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE --

04:03:47.612 --> 04:03:50.716
AND COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH THEN

04:03:50.782 --> 04:03:52.050
THEY GENERALLY PURSUE THAT.

04:03:52.117 --> 04:03:54.920
ON AND GENERALLY WE WOULD AGREE

04:03:54.987 --> 04:03:56.521
WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT

04:03:56.588 --> 04:03:57.823
THEY DID --

04:03:57.889 --> 04:03:59.424
WHERE THAT IS THE MOST COST

04:03:59.491 --> 04:04:01.994
EFFECTIVE APPROACH THAT'S THE

04:04:02.060 --> 04:04:03.261
APPROACH THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN?

04:04:03.328 --> 04:04:04.763
THE QUESTION IS IS THE IS THE

04:04:04.830 --> 04:04:06.832
SMALL FEELING SYSTEMS THAT SAY

04:04:06.898 --> 04:04:08.900
OVER MY DEAD BODY YOU'RE NOT

04:04:08.967 --> 04:04:11.603
WE'RE NOT CONSOLIDATE AND SINCE

04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:13.372
IS A RELATIVELY NEW TOOL TO GO

04:04:13.438 --> 04:04:14.573
IN AND TO SAY.

04:04:14.639 --> 04:04:17.009
NO YOU WILL AND IF THAT BECOMES

04:04:17.075 --> 04:04:18.577
A LEGAL CHALLENGES DAY I CAN

04:04:18.643 --> 04:04:20.712
IMAGINE THE PRICE GOING UP

04:04:20.779 --> 04:04:22.514
VERSUS WE DON'T HAVE THE WHERE

04:04:22.581 --> 04:04:24.549
WITH ALL WE DON'T HAVE THE DOUGH

04:04:24.616 --> 04:04:27.019
WE ARE WE DISAGREE THAT WERE

04:04:27.085 --> 04:04:27.285
FAILING.

04:04:27.352 --> 04:04:28.687
AT THE END OF HìNH INTERESTING

04:04:28.754 --> 04:04:30.956
POINT -- BUT

04:04:31.023 --> 04:04:33.492
YOU CAN IMAGINE SOME OF THIS

04:04:33.558 --> 04:04:35.660
BALL GAME VERSUS JUST WATER IN

04:04:35.727 --> 04:04:38.163
AG PEOPLE.

04:04:38.230 --> 04:04:38.864
SO I CAN.

04:04:38.930 --> 04:04:40.332
THAT'S AN UNCERTAINTY WILL NEVER

04:04:40.399 --> 04:04:42.868
KNOW RIGHT I MEAN THIS IS.

04:04:42.934 --> 04:04:45.103
HOW MUCH COOPERATION WE GET --

04:04:45.170 --> 04:04:47.706
WHEN A FOR ALL IN UNDER THE --

04:04:47.773 --> 04:04:49.641
THE PROPOSAL GO ON WITH YOUR

04:04:49.708 --> 04:04:50.976
COMMENTS I'M SORRY.

04:04:51.043 --> 04:04:52.477
AND ANOTHER POINT THAT WE MADE

04:04:52.544 --> 04:04:54.546
IS THAT THAT THE MASTER THE

04:04:54.613 --> 04:04:56.014
CHARGE PAIRS WOULD NOT BE.

04:04:56.081 --> 04:04:58.650
DIRECT BENEFICIARIES THE PROGRAM

04:04:58.717 --> 04:04:59.851
MEANING THAT THE MAIN

04:04:59.918 --> 04:05:01.453
BENEFICIARIES OF THE PROGRAM

04:05:01.520 --> 04:05:02.287
WOULD BE PEOPLE AND

04:05:02.354 --> 04:05:03.955
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

04:05:04.022 --> 04:05:07.259
THE SERVER BY SMALLER WATER

04:05:07.325 --> 04:05:07.492
SYSTEMS.

04:05:07.559 --> 04:05:08.360
I'M.

04:05:08.427 --> 04:05:09.928
THE LARGEST SHARE THE PROGRAM

04:05:09.995 --> 04:05:11.363
COSTS HOWEVER WOULD BE PAID BY

04:05:11.430 --> 04:05:13.432
WATER SYSTEM RATE PAYERS ACROSS

04:05:13.498 --> 04:05:14.900
THE STATE MANY OF HIM OUR

04:05:14.966 --> 04:05:16.968
CUSTOMERS OF LARGE WATER SYSTEMS

04:05:17.035 --> 04:05:18.036
THAT ALREADY.

04:05:18.103 --> 04:05:19.371
PROVIDE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE

04:05:19.438 --> 04:05:20.739
DRINKING WATER THERE'S FOR THOSE

04:05:20.806 --> 04:05:23.442
SYSTEMS WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE FOR

04:05:23.508 --> 04:05:24.943
ASSISTANCE FROM THE PROGRAM.

04:05:25.010 --> 04:05:26.311
AND THE MAJORITY OF THESE RATE

04:05:26.378 --> 04:05:28.480
PAYERS IS THERE ALREADY

04:05:28.547 --> 04:05:30.215
RECEIVING THAT THAT AND THAT

04:05:30.282 --> 04:05:31.883
HOWEVER THEY BE PAYING FOR

04:05:31.950 --> 04:05:33.218
GENERALLY THE BULK OF THE COSTS

04:05:33.285 --> 04:05:34.486
AND THEREFORE THEY'RE UNLIKELY

04:05:34.553 --> 04:05:37.022
TO DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM THE

04:05:37.089 --> 04:05:37.856
PROGRAM.

04:05:37.923 --> 04:05:39.991
AS THEIR WATER SYSTEMS WOULD NOT

04:05:40.058 --> 04:05:41.993
BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR FUNDING

04:05:42.060 --> 04:05:43.795
FROM IT HOWEVER THERE WOULD BE

04:05:43.862 --> 04:05:45.297
THE INDIRECT BENEFIT OF THOSE

04:05:45.363 --> 04:05:46.598
PEOPLE WHEN THEY TRAVEL TO OTHER

04:05:46.665 --> 04:05:47.899
PARTS OF THE STATE OR THEY STAY

04:05:47.966 --> 04:05:49.568
IN PLACES THAT ARE BENEFITING

04:05:49.634 --> 04:05:51.336
DIRECTLY FROM THE PROGRAMMING.

04:05:51.403 --> 04:05:55.207
HAVING BETTER ACCESS TO SAFE AND

04:05:55.273 --> 04:05:56.508
AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER.

04:05:56.575 --> 04:05:58.143
ANOTHER POINT THAT WE WANTED TO

04:05:58.210 --> 04:05:59.678
RAISE IS THAT.

04:05:59.744 --> 04:06:01.279
POSTED THE CHARGE PAIRS WOULD

04:06:01.346 --> 04:06:02.347
NOT BE AT FAULT FOR THE

04:06:02.414 --> 04:06:03.548
CONTAMINATION IT'S BEING

04:06:03.615 --> 04:06:04.616
MEDICATED --

04:06:04.683 --> 04:06:06.118
THE VAST MENTIONED FOR EXAMPLE

04:06:06.184 --> 04:06:07.285
THE VAST MAJORITY OF NITRATE

04:06:07.352 --> 04:06:09.020
CONTAMINATION IS CAUSED BY

04:06:09.087 --> 04:06:11.556
AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS

04:06:11.623 --> 04:06:13.058
FERTILIZER APPLICATIONS IN

04:06:13.125 --> 04:06:17.295
ANIMAL OPERATIONS SUCH AS DAIRY --

04:06:17.362 --> 04:06:18.530
COVERAGE WITH NOTHING AT SOME OF

04:06:18.597 --> 04:06:19.798
THAT THE CURRENT NITRIC

04:06:19.865 --> 04:06:21.333
CONTAMINANTS IN GROUNDWATER

04:06:21.399 --> 04:06:22.400
THEY'RE NOT FROM THE CURRENT

04:06:22.467 --> 04:06:24.870
AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS IS THAT

04:06:24.936 --> 04:06:27.172
SOME OF THESE NITRATES ARE FROM.

04:06:27.239 --> 04:06:30.408
LEGACY CONTAMINATION THEY COULD

04:06:30.475 --> 04:06:32.177
BE FROM AS MUCH AS DECADES AGO.

04:06:32.244 --> 04:06:33.845
WE LOOKED AT ALTERNATIVE FUNDING

04:06:33.912 --> 04:06:35.480
SOURCES TO SEE IF WE COULD

04:06:35.547 --> 04:06:37.616
IDENTIFY AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING

04:06:37.682 --> 04:06:40.252
SOURCE WE THINK GENERAL FUND.

04:06:40.318 --> 04:06:42.154
IS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THE TO

04:06:42.220 --> 04:06:44.689
FUND THIS PROGRAM HOWEVER WE

04:06:44.756 --> 04:06:46.057
ALSO NOTE THAT.

04:06:46.124 --> 04:06:47.159
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER

04:06:47.225 --> 04:06:49.361
PROGRAMS CAN HEATING FOR SCARCE

04:06:49.427 --> 04:06:51.429
GENERAL FUND RESOURCES AND IF

04:06:51.496 --> 04:06:52.898
THAT WAS CHOSEN A FUNDING

04:06:52.964 --> 04:06:54.766
MECHANISM THIS PROGRAM WILL

04:06:54.833 --> 04:06:56.768
CONSTANTLY BE IN COMPETITION

04:06:56.835 --> 04:06:58.403
WITH THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS FOR

04:06:58.470 --> 04:06:59.771
THAT GENERAL FUND.

04:06:59.838 --> 04:07:01.106
THIS IS GOING TO PROGRAM WE

04:07:01.173 --> 04:07:05.644
CREATE AND ON TO A FOR FINDING

04:07:05.710 --> 04:07:08.313
ON BECAUSE IT WOULD BE PROVIDING

04:07:08.380 --> 04:07:09.781
THE SAFE DRINKING WATER IF YOU

04:07:09.848 --> 04:07:11.583
THAT FINDING DECREASED THAT

04:07:11.650 --> 04:07:14.286
COULD POTENTIALLY PUT THAT SAFE

04:07:14.352 --> 04:07:15.987
DRINKING WATER AT RISK.

04:07:16.054 --> 04:07:17.989
ON YOUR PART.

04:07:18.056 --> 04:07:19.691
WITH THE NITRATES.

04:07:19.758 --> 04:07:21.493
A WORKING MODEL SEEMS TO BE A

04:07:21.560 --> 04:07:23.595
SEVENTY THIRTY SPLIT ON WHAT IS

04:07:23.662 --> 04:07:25.363
A LOT OF TOWARDS NITRATES IN

04:07:25.430 --> 04:07:27.265
AGRICULTURE WHETHER IT'S A

04:07:27.332 --> 04:07:28.867
LEGACY HERE I'M GOING. TO

04:07:28.934 --> 04:07:31.269
DISAGREE WITH THAT THE VISION OR

04:07:31.336 --> 04:07:33.038
THAT CALCULATION.

04:07:33.104 --> 04:07:34.272
WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT

04:07:34.339 --> 04:07:35.574
CALCULATION WE JUST THINK

04:07:35.640 --> 04:07:37.542
THERE'S CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY

04:07:37.609 --> 04:07:40.812
ABOUT IT ON AND THAT WAS PART

04:07:40.879 --> 04:07:42.647
I'VE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE

04:07:42.714 --> 04:07:43.748
HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLAR

04:07:43.815 --> 04:07:44.816
ESTIMATE.

04:07:44.883 --> 04:07:46.384
THAT WAS DONE BY THE PRIVATE

04:07:46.451 --> 04:07:48.386
CONSULTING FIRM AND I WAS PART

04:07:48.453 --> 04:07:49.554
OF THEIR ESTIMATE SO I THINK

04:07:49.621 --> 04:07:51.756
THERE'S THERE'S JUST UNCERTAINTY

04:07:51.823 --> 04:07:54.960
THERE.

04:07:55.026 --> 04:07:56.761
SO WE ALSO LEFT IN TERMS OF

04:07:56.828 --> 04:07:58.730
ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES AT

04:07:58.797 --> 04:08:00.298
BOND FUNDING BUT WE DON'T THINK

04:08:00.365 --> 04:08:01.333
IT'S AN APPROPRIATE SOURCE

04:08:01.399 --> 04:08:03.068
BECAUSE TYPICALLY IT'S USED FOR

04:08:03.134 --> 04:08:04.402
A ONE TIME PROJECTS.

04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:06.838
AND THIS WOULD REQUIRE ONGOING

04:08:06.905 --> 04:08:09.007
FUNDING AND ALSO --

04:08:09.074 --> 04:08:11.910
WE LOOKED AT SPECIAL FUNDS --

04:08:11.977 --> 04:08:13.511
THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO

04:08:13.578 --> 04:08:14.746
SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM WOULD HAVE

04:08:14.813 --> 04:08:16.481
SUFFICIENT AVAILABLE FUNDS AND

04:08:16.548 --> 04:08:20.218
WE WERE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY

04:08:20.285 --> 04:08:20.752
OF THE SPECIAL FUNDS AS AN

04:08:20.819 --> 04:08:21.653
OPTION.

04:08:21.720 --> 04:08:23.321
AND THEN FINALLY THE WE WANTED

04:08:23.388 --> 04:08:24.222
TO POINT OUT THAT THE SAFE

04:08:24.289 --> 04:08:26.391
HARBOR PROVISIONS WOULD AFFECT

04:08:26.458 --> 04:08:28.159
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY THAT THE

04:08:28.226 --> 04:08:30.195
STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL

04:08:30.262 --> 04:08:30.428
BOARD.

04:08:30.495 --> 04:08:32.864
THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS

04:08:32.931 --> 04:08:34.232
INVOLVE SOME POLICY TRADE OFFS

04:08:34.299 --> 04:08:36.001
COMPARED TO THE STATE'S CURRENT

04:08:36.067 --> 04:08:37.535
ENFORCEMENT APPROACH.

04:08:37.602 --> 04:08:39.371
ON THE ONE HAND THE PROPOSAL IS

04:08:39.437 --> 04:08:40.272
STRUCTURED TO BETTER ENSURE THAT

04:08:40.338 --> 04:08:42.274
A SIGNIFICANT FUNDING IS

04:08:42.340 --> 04:08:44.009
AVAILABLE FOR WATER QUALITY

04:08:44.075 --> 04:08:46.278
MITIGATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

04:08:46.344 --> 04:08:48.280
RATHER THAN T. THAN LIMITED TO

04:08:48.346 --> 04:08:50.215
JUST CERTAIN AREAS IN THE STATE.

04:08:50.282 --> 04:08:54.519
SPECIFICALLY FOR NITRATES AND

04:08:54.586 --> 04:08:56.187
THE PROPOSAL IS THAT AS THE

04:08:56.254 --> 04:08:57.622
STATE WOULD RELINQUISH SOME OF

04:08:57.689 --> 04:08:58.957
ITS AUTHORITY --

04:08:59.024 --> 04:09:00.258
TO TAKE CERTAIN ENFORCEMENT

04:09:00.325 --> 04:09:01.693
ACTION SUCH AS CLEAN UP AN

04:09:01.760 --> 04:09:03.895
ABATEMENT ORDERS AGAINST

04:09:03.962 --> 04:09:05.563
POLLUTERS IF THERE OTHERWISE

04:09:05.630 --> 04:09:06.865
COMPLYING WITH THEIR APPLICABLE

04:09:06.931 --> 04:09:08.833
PERMITS IN WAIVERS AND I'M

04:09:08.900 --> 04:09:10.268
TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT.

04:09:10.335 --> 04:09:12.337
THE AGRICULTURAL ENTITIES THAT

04:09:12.404 --> 04:09:14.039
WOULD BE I PAINS CHARGES INTO

04:09:14.105 --> 04:09:16.441
THE FINE SAID THAT CONCLUDES MY

04:09:16.508 --> 04:09:18.043
REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

04:09:18.109 --> 04:09:19.411
ANY QUESTIONS.

04:09:19.477 --> 04:09:20.745
I GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE

04:09:20.812 --> 04:09:23.048
BEST PRACTICES GOING FORWARD I

04:09:23.114 --> 04:09:24.849
WAS PART OF A STUDY GROUP

04:09:24.916 --> 04:09:26.484
RECESSION THE WENT TO INDIA AND

04:09:26.551 --> 04:09:29.154
WE WE HAD HAD A MEETING WITH.

04:09:29.220 --> 04:09:31.523
AN INDIAN FERTILIZER COMPANY

04:09:31.589 --> 04:09:32.590
THAT WAS GOING --

04:09:32.657 --> 04:09:34.592
TO ALL ORGANICS THEY WERE GOING

04:09:34.659 --> 04:09:36.995
AWAY FROM PETROLEUM BASE I

04:09:37.062 --> 04:09:38.363
TREATING GOING TO YOU KNOW A

04:09:38.430 --> 04:09:40.265
MORE HEALTHY SOIL WE TALKED

04:09:40.332 --> 04:09:42.734
ABOUT THAT PREVIOUSLY SO SO WELL

04:09:42.801 --> 04:09:44.736
THAT'S NOT BEFORE AS IF THE BEST

04:09:44.803 --> 04:09:46.805
PRACTICES CHAIN SO THAT WE'RE

04:09:46.871 --> 04:09:50.575
NOT.

04:09:50.642 --> 04:09:52.944
CONTINUE TO USE THE PER.

04:09:53.011 --> 04:09:54.879
THE EXCESSIVE NITRATES IN IN IN

04:09:54.946 --> 04:09:56.081
THE SOIL.

04:09:56.147 --> 04:09:57.248
THEN THAT MAY BE A SELF

04:09:57.315 --> 04:09:58.650
CORRECTING THE NOMINAL AGAIN

04:09:58.717 --> 04:10:00.652
THAT'S MORE.

04:10:00.719 --> 04:10:02.987
AG THEN WATER RESOURCE POOR BUT

04:10:03.054 --> 04:10:05.490
THE THE PROGRAM BENEFITS I MEAN

04:10:05.557 --> 04:10:06.725
IF WE IF.

04:10:06.791 --> 04:10:08.526
IF CALIFORNIA CHOOSE THE GO DOWN

04:10:08.593 --> 04:10:10.495
THAT PATH [inaudible]

04:10:10.562 --> 04:10:12.831
ALRIGHT COME.

04:10:12.897 --> 04:10:13.998
CALLING SENATOR.

04:10:14.065 --> 04:10:14.599
MINING SURPRISINGLY YOU HAVE A

04:10:14.666 --> 04:10:17.502
QUESTION ON THIS.

04:10:17.569 --> 04:10:19.270
THE FOR TO THE DIRECTOR AND SEE

04:10:19.337 --> 04:10:21.940
IF YOU HAD ANY RESPONSES TO THAT

04:10:22.006 --> 04:10:22.774
LA --

04:10:22.841 --> 04:10:24.843
COMMENTS FROM.

04:10:24.909 --> 04:10:26.378
PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF

04:10:26.444 --> 04:10:27.979
EXPLORING OTHER [inaudible]

04:10:28.046 --> 04:10:30.448
FUNDING OPTIONS.

04:10:30.515 --> 04:10:31.649
OTHER FUNDING OTHER FUNDING

04:10:31.716 --> 04:10:33.918
OPTIONS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AS

04:10:33.985 --> 04:10:34.919
YOU WILL NOTE CENTER MINING YOU

04:10:34.986 --> 04:10:36.321
KNOW THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME

04:10:36.388 --> 04:10:38.923
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE'S TAKINGUP THIS ISSUE.

04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:40.792
AND WHAT WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE

04:10:40.859 --> 04:10:43.128
WITH IS THAT IT HAS TO BE A A

04:10:43.194 --> 04:10:45.130
STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING WE'RE

04:10:45.196 --> 04:10:45.864
TALKING ABOUT OPERATION AND

04:10:45.930 --> 04:10:47.732
MAINTENANCE OF FUNDING FOR FOR

04:10:47.799 --> 04:10:49.267
THE SYSTEMS TRANSITION AIR.

04:10:49.334 --> 04:10:50.468
TRANSACTION YOU KNOW WHETHER

04:10:50.535 --> 04:10:51.803
THEY'RE IN TRANSITION OR WILL

04:10:51.870 --> 04:10:54.005
HAVE TO BE FOR OUR HOWEVER LONG.

04:10:54.072 --> 04:10:55.373
YOU CAN'T JUST.

04:10:55.440 --> 04:10:57.842
CUT OFFS AN ARBITRARILY OR OR

04:10:57.909 --> 04:10:59.444
HAVE FLUCTUATING.

04:10:59.511 --> 04:11:01.646
THE FUND BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU

04:11:01.713 --> 04:11:02.180
YOU DON'T HAVE AGAIN THAT

04:11:02.247 --> 04:11:03.782
CONSISTENT.

04:11:03.848 --> 04:11:05.049
ABLE FUNDING THAT THEY CAN COME

04:11:05.116 --> 04:11:06.484
FROM IT AND SO --

04:11:06.551 --> 04:11:07.318
IN THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE

04:11:07.385 --> 04:11:08.720
HAVE ALREADY INSOFAR AS WE'VE

04:11:08.787 --> 04:11:09.421
SPENT.

04:11:09.487 --> 04:11:11.322
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

04:11:11.389 --> 04:11:12.924
IN CAPITAL FUNDING --

04:11:12.991 --> 04:11:14.959
FROM THE STATE REVOLVING LOAN

04:11:15.026 --> 04:11:17.529
FUNDS AND AND OTHER SOURCES BOND

04:11:17.595 --> 04:11:18.096
SIX CETERA INTO THESE

04:11:18.163 --> 04:11:19.130
COMMUNITIES.

04:11:19.197 --> 04:11:21.533
BUT AGAIN IT'S THE OPERATION AND

04:11:21.599 --> 04:11:25.403
MAINTENANCE COMPONENT IN SUBJECT

04:11:25.470 --> 04:11:27.105
TO ABILITY PREDICTABILITY IT'S

04:11:27.172 --> 04:11:28.440
GONNA BE VERY CRITICAL TO THE

04:11:28.506 --> 04:11:29.707
PROGRAM THE SUCCESS OF THE

04:11:29.774 --> 04:11:30.542
PROGRAM.

04:11:30.608 --> 04:11:32.210
AND YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF HOW

04:11:32.277 --> 04:11:33.645
MANY OF THESE.

04:11:33.711 --> 04:11:35.580
ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED SYSTEMS

04:11:35.647 --> 04:11:37.582
WOULD.

04:11:37.649 --> 04:11:38.550
WOULD BE CANDIDATES FOR

04:11:38.616 --> 04:11:40.285
CONSOLIDATION WITH THE CLEAN

04:11:40.351 --> 04:11:41.786
WATER.

04:11:41.853 --> 04:11:43.154
SOURCE --

04:11:43.221 --> 04:11:44.355
ALL DEFERRED TO DURABLE HE

04:11:44.422 --> 04:11:45.723
MISSED BUT YOU KNOW WHEN IT

04:11:45.790 --> 04:11:47.091
COMES TO REGIONALIZATION

04:11:47.158 --> 04:11:48.593
CONSOLIDATION IT'S PRETTY MUCH

04:11:48.660 --> 04:11:51.596
OUR PRIMARY TOOL WE HAVE TO AS

04:11:51.663 --> 04:11:53.631
DARREN IN ALWAYS POINTS OUT. 95%

04:11:53.698 --> 04:11:55.166
OF OUR VIOLATIONS COME FROM

04:11:55.233 --> 04:11:56.067
SYSTEMS UNDER FIVE HUNDRED

04:11:56.134 --> 04:11:58.102
CONNECTIONS SO THERE'S A DIRECT

04:11:58.169 --> 04:11:59.237
ISSUE HERE WITH.

04:11:59.304 --> 04:12:00.705
THE REPAIR BAY SIZE IN YOUR

04:12:00.772 --> 04:12:02.507
ABILITY TO SERVE CLEAN AND SAFE

04:12:02.574 --> 04:12:03.608
DRINKING WATER.

04:12:03.675 --> 04:12:04.876
SO -- SO

04:12:04.943 --> 04:12:06.511
WHEN IT COMES TO OF THOSE THREE

04:12:06.578 --> 04:12:08.146
HUNDRED OR SO I DON'T HAVE AN

04:12:08.213 --> 04:12:09.581
EXACT NUMBER BUT I ALL ALLOWED

04:12:09.647 --> 04:12:11.683
DARRON TO TO MAYBE IF IN CASE HE

04:12:11.749 --> 04:12:13.351
HAS A BETTER IDEA.

04:12:13.418 --> 04:12:15.453
OF YEAH AND I REALIZE IT MAY BE

04:12:15.520 --> 04:12:16.788
AN ESTIMATE I'M JUST TRYING TO

04:12:16.855 --> 04:12:18.122
GET A TEST SO OUR OUR ESTIMATES

04:12:18.189 --> 04:12:22.026
ARE GOING INTO THIS JUST LOOKING

04:12:22.093 --> 04:12:23.962
A CONSOLIDATION.

04:12:24.028 --> 04:12:26.231
AMONG ALL OF MY POINT AND SECOND

04:12:26.297 --> 04:12:27.398
ARM WERE WERE RANGING AND SO WE

04:12:27.465 --> 04:12:27.899
WE DID VERY CONSERVATIVE

04:12:27.966 --> 04:12:28.933
ESTIMATES BASED ON DISTANCE FROM

04:12:29.000 --> 04:12:30.068
A LARGER WATER SYSTEMS AND

04:12:30.134 --> 04:12:31.536
WHATNOT SO IT'S IT'S CRUDE --

04:12:31.603 --> 04:12:33.271
BUT IT WAS LITERALLY BETWEEN A

04:12:33.338 --> 04:12:34.973
QUARTER AND WERE AVAILABLE FOR

04:12:35.039 --> 04:12:36.407
CONSOLIDATION JUST FROM KIND OF

04:12:36.474 --> 04:12:37.675
A CURSORY REVIEW.

04:12:37.742 --> 04:12:39.110
OUT WHAT'S MISSING AND WHAT WE

04:12:39.177 --> 04:12:40.879
NEED TO DEVELOP FURTHER AS SOME

04:12:40.945 --> 04:12:42.146
OTHER TOOLS ASSOCIATE WITH.

04:12:42.213 --> 04:12:43.948
REGIONALIZATION THEY MAY NOT

04:12:44.015 --> 04:12:47.785
REALLY BE TING PHYSICALLY BUT WE

04:12:47.852 --> 04:12:49.120
NEED TO PUT SMALL SYSTEMS

04:12:49.187 --> 04:12:51.723
TOGETHER UNDER ONE MANAGER UNDER

04:12:51.789 --> 04:12:53.191
ONE BUILDING SYSTEM UNDER.

04:12:53.258 --> 04:12:54.726
ONE PROFESSIONAL KIND A GROUP

04:12:54.792 --> 04:12:56.094
AND THEN JOIN THEM TOGETHER AND

04:12:56.160 --> 04:12:56.928
THAT WAY TO PROVIDE SOME

04:12:56.995 --> 04:12:58.463
ADDITION SEES WHICH WOULD BE

04:12:58.530 --> 04:13:00.465
ANOTHER FORMER CONSOLIDATION.

04:13:00.532 --> 04:13:04.569
THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

04:13:04.636 --> 04:13:05.904
CAN WE TOUCH ON THE PEOPLE WHO

04:13:05.970 --> 04:13:07.438
ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE

04:13:07.505 --> 04:13:09.374
STATE OR UNDER THE JURISDICTION

04:13:09.440 --> 04:13:11.976
THE SMALL WELLS THE PEOPLE AT

04:13:12.043 --> 04:13:13.711
LESS THAN.

04:13:13.778 --> 04:13:14.946
FOURTEEN HOOK UPS AND ALL OF

04:13:15.013 --> 04:13:18.249
THOSE --

04:13:18.316 --> 04:13:19.751
SORT OF LIKE ELAINE ALLERGIES

04:13:19.817 --> 04:13:20.051
[inaudible]

04:13:20.118 --> 04:13:24.422
I I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SOME.

04:13:24.489 --> 04:13:26.324
HOMES OR SOME PLACE WHERE PEOPLE

04:13:26.391 --> 04:13:29.027
ARELIVING THAT ARE TOO FAR GONE.

04:13:29.093 --> 04:13:30.695
THAT THE WELL WAS CONTAMINATED

04:13:30.762 --> 04:13:32.497
THE SEPTIC IS CONTAMINATE THE

04:13:32.564 --> 04:13:35.533
WELL IT WAS IN A NATURALLY

04:13:35.600 --> 04:13:37.535
OCCURRING ARSENIC.

04:13:37.602 --> 04:13:39.537
BE SEN IT'S JUST SOMEBODY BUILT

04:13:39.604 --> 04:13:41.139
A HOUSE THERE ONCE UPON A TIME

04:13:41.205 --> 04:13:43.107
AND CALLS AT HOME BUT FROM OUR

04:13:43.174 --> 04:13:44.709
POINT OF VIEW FROM OF PROVIDING

04:13:44.776 --> 04:13:46.110
SAFE DRINKING WATER.

04:13:46.177 --> 04:13:48.980
IT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO DO

04:13:49.047 --> 04:13:51.416
THAT BECAUSE YOUR SOUL REMOTE

04:13:51.482 --> 04:13:54.519
REMOVE FROM.

04:13:54.586 --> 04:13:55.987
OTHER FUNCTIONING --

04:13:56.054 --> 04:13:58.022
SYSTEMS [inaudible]

04:13:58.089 --> 04:13:59.223
THAT'S BETTER.

04:13:59.290 --> 04:14:01.593
NOT OUR WATER RESOURCE OR NAG A

04:14:01.659 --> 04:14:03.494
QUESTION IT'S IT'S IT'S A

04:14:03.561 --> 04:14:04.896
CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE

04:14:04.963 --> 04:14:06.931
THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT THE

04:14:06.998 --> 04:14:07.532
PUBLIC HAS.

04:14:07.599 --> 04:14:08.433
THEY'VE.

04:14:08.499 --> 04:14:09.867
BEEN HERE AT THE SEVERAL

04:14:09.934 --> 04:14:11.669
COMMITTEES ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHT

04:14:11.736 --> 04:14:13.237
AND EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT TO TO

04:14:13.304 --> 04:14:14.539
WATER AND I'M CONCERNED WITH

04:14:14.606 --> 04:14:16.007
SOME PEOPLE EXPECTING I'M GONNA

04:14:16.074 --> 04:14:17.375
STAND MY GROUND.

04:14:17.442 --> 04:14:21.112
AND YOU WILL CLEAN THIS UP IN I

04:14:21.179 --> 04:14:23.014
DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE DOING A

04:14:23.081 --> 04:14:24.182
LOT HERE BUT THERE ARE SOME

04:14:24.248 --> 04:14:27.485
TOOLS WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS.

04:14:27.552 --> 04:14:29.087
TO AT LEAST STATE.

04:14:29.153 --> 04:14:30.922
JURISDICTION OVER THE SMALL OF

04:14:30.989 --> 04:14:34.125
FACILITIES.

04:14:34.192 --> 04:14:36.861
INDEPENDENT FACILITIES I GUESS.

04:14:36.928 --> 04:14:38.196
HAS GIVEN ME ADD ONE THING THERE

04:14:38.262 --> 04:14:39.197
I THINK YOU WOULD FIND IT

04:14:39.263 --> 04:14:41.499
THERE'S A SURPRISING NUMBER OF

04:14:41.566 --> 04:14:42.834
PRIVATE DOMESTIC WELLS

04:14:42.900 --> 04:14:44.235
IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS

04:14:44.302 --> 04:14:46.537
OF EXISTING WATER SYSTEMS IT'S

04:14:46.604 --> 04:14:48.006
BEEN A BIG SURPRISE MINE AS WELL.

04:14:48.072 --> 04:14:48.606
A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

04:14:48.673 --> 04:14:50.642
FOCUS ON IS HAVING THOSE PEOPLE

04:14:50.708 --> 04:14:52.210
HAVE THE OPTION TO VOLUNTARY

04:14:52.276 --> 04:14:54.345
CONSOLIDATE WITH THAT LARGER

04:14:54.412 --> 04:14:55.013
WATER SYSTEM IT'S NOT A BIG

04:14:55.079 --> 04:14:55.747
STRETCH.

04:14:55.813 --> 04:14:56.748
BATTLE CAPTURE A LOT OF THEM

04:14:56.814 --> 04:14:57.915
YOU'RE COMPLETELY RIGHT THERE

04:14:57.982 --> 04:14:59.417
ARE SOME THAT ARE SO REMOTE THAT

04:14:59.484 --> 04:15:00.585
THE QUESTION.

04:15:00.652 --> 04:15:01.919
BEGS ITSELF AS TO WHAT WE'RE

04:15:01.986 --> 04:15:02.920
GONNA DO WITH.

THOUSAND AND THAT'S NOT THERE

04:15:04.088 --> 04:15:04.689

ONCE WE REGULATE WE KNOW QUITE A

04:16:44.822 --> 04:16:47.492
BIT ABOUT WE HAVE A GOOD SENSE

04:16:47.558 --> 04:16:49.527
OF WHAT THE NEED IS THE WHAT

04:16:49.594 --> 04:16:50.962
WHERE WE NEED TO DODD THAT THE

04:16:51.028 --> 04:16:52.096
FUNDING NEEDS.

04:16:52.163 --> 04:16:53.931
AND WHERE WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE

04:16:53.998 --> 04:16:55.399

BIG BLINKING RED LIGHTS YOU KNOW

04:16:57.068 --> 04:16:58.803
THAT'S THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A SYSTEM

04:16:58.870 --> 04:16:59.937
IN NEED BUT THERE ARE.

04:17:00.004 --> 04:17:01.773
SO MANY OTHERS THAT ARE MAYBE A

04:17:01.839 --> 04:17:02.440
YEAR.

04:17:02.507 --> 04:17:04.075
TWO YOU KNOW A PUMP FAILURE AWAY

04:17:04.142 --> 04:17:06.077
FROM FROM BEING IN THAT CATEGORY

04:17:06.144 --> 04:17:07.812
AS WELL NONETHELESS SO WE HAVE

04:17:07.879 --> 04:17:09.180
THAT PART WE NOTE WE UNDERSTAND

04:17:09.247 --> 04:17:10.248
QUITE A BIT.

04:17:10.314 --> 04:17:12.183
IN THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS

04:17:12.250 --> 04:17:14.552
REALLY SUPPOSED TO FILL IN RULES

04:17:14.619 --> 04:17:16.154
AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE DOMESTIC

04:17:16.220 --> 04:17:17.622
WELLS KIND OF COMPLETE THE

04:17:17.688 --> 04:17:20.925
PICTURE OF THE THE THE THE THE

04:17:20.992 --> 04:17:21.959
DOLLAR AMOUNT NEEDS AN AND

04:17:22.026 --> 04:17:23.594
OTHERWISE AND SO.

04:17:23.661 --> 04:17:25.329
I THINK THE PARENTS TIMELINE --

04:17:25.396 --> 04:17:26.364
THAT BIGGER NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS

04:17:26.430 --> 04:17:28.833
ABOUT A TWO YEAR TIME WINDOW AS

04:17:28.900 --> 04:17:29.133
THE LA -- I

04:17:29.200 --> 04:17:30.568
THINK INDICATED.

04:17:30.635 --> 04:17:32.270
BUT OF THOSE ENTITIES WE ALREADY

04:17:32.336 --> 04:17:33.971
REGULATE I THINK WE HAVE A

04:17:34.038 --> 04:17:35.173
REALLY OPPORTUNITY.

04:17:35.239 --> 04:17:37.708

YOU KNOW STAR TREK TAKE YOU LATE

04:17:38.676 --> 04:17:40.111
WHAT THIS PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION

04:17:40.178 --> 04:17:41.512
LOOKS LIKE THE PEOPLE GET

04:17:41.579 --> 04:17:42.847
GREATER CERTAINTY I THINK RUN

04:17:42.914 --> 04:17:44.215
THE PROGRAM.

04:17:44.282 --> 04:17:46.184
ON THE FEES ALSO TO DEFER TO

04:17:46.250 --> 04:17:47.418
DARREN I THINK ON THAT THERE AND

04:17:47.485 --> 04:17:51.088
YOU CAN GIVE A PIECE OF IT WILL

04:17:51.155 --> 04:17:52.590
GO TO KEVIN ACT THE WITH THAT.

04:17:52.657 --> 04:17:53.457
OKAY YEAH THE CONFINED ANIMAL

04:17:53.524 --> 04:17:54.992
FEEDING OPERATIONS THE CURRENT

04:17:55.059 --> 04:17:56.427
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT.

04:17:56.494 --> 04:17:57.762
INSTRUCTS US TO CONVENE A

04:17:57.829 --> 04:17:59.697
WORKING GROUP AND TO EXAMINE

04:17:59.764 --> 04:18:01.032
WHAT THE PROPER FEE LEVELS

04:18:01.098 --> 04:18:02.733
SHOULD BE BASED ON WHAT'S OUT

04:18:02.800 --> 04:18:04.268
THERE WHAT TYPES OF OPERATIONS

04:18:04.335 --> 04:18:05.469
AND WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED.

04:18:05.536 --> 04:18:07.171
AND SO WHAT WE ENVISION WITHOUT

04:18:07.238 --> 04:18:08.306
LANGUAGE HOW WE WOULD WORK WITH

04:18:08.372 --> 04:18:09.440
IT AS WOULD WORK VERY CLOSELY%

04:18:09.507 --> 04:18:11.242
WITH THE WATER BOARD.

04:18:11.309 --> 04:18:12.810
AND FIND OUT YOU KNOW WE DON'T

04:18:12.877 --> 04:18:13.878
WANT TO GO OUT THERE IN RETREAT

04:18:13.945 --> 04:18:14.979
THE WHEEL AS FAR AS TRYING TO

04:18:15.046 --> 04:18:16.380
IDENTIFY DEFINITIONS OR THINGS

04:18:16.447 --> 04:18:17.348
LIKE THAT.

04:18:17.415 --> 04:18:18.549
AND SO YEAH WE WOULD DEFINITELY

04:18:18.616 --> 04:18:20.084
COLLABORATE AND THEN MOVE

04:18:20.151 --> 04:18:21.686
FORWARD WITH THIS WORKING GROUP

04:18:21.752 --> 04:18:23.154
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THAT IS

04:18:23.221 --> 04:18:24.989
REFLECTED IN OUR WROTE BUDGET

04:18:25.056 --> 04:18:27.024
REQUEST FOR SOME POSITIONS TO

04:18:27.091 --> 04:18:40.905
HELP US DO THAT.

04:18:40.972 --> 04:18:42.840
ACTUALLY BOTH THE INTEL WIDI

04:18:42.907 --> 04:18:44.308
UNTIL WE GET TO THE REVENUE

04:18:44.375 --> 04:18:46.277
ESTIMATES ARE TILL WE GET TO THE

04:18:46.344 --> 04:18:47.511
TO FEES CHARGED WE CAN'T.

04:18:47.578 --> 04:18:48.679
BEGIN TO SPECULATE ON WHAT THE

04:18:48.746 --> 04:18:50.248
REVENUE ESTIMATE WOULD BE WE DO

04:18:50.314 --> 04:18:51.515
HAVE REVENUE ESTIMATES ON THE

04:18:51.582 --> 04:18:53.150
OTHER TWO COMPONENTS IF YOU'RE

04:18:53.217 --> 04:18:54.185
INTERESTED IN THAT --

04:18:54.252 --> 04:18:55.920
THE DERRY FEES WE ESTIMATE TO BE

04:18:55.987 --> 04:18:57.154
ABOUT FIVE TO SIX MILLION

04:18:57.221 --> 04:18:58.890
DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND FERTILIZER

04:18:58.956 --> 04:19:01.225
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOURTEEN TO

04:19:01.292 --> 04:19:17.808
SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY

04:19:26.417 --> 04:19:26.484
.

04:19:26.484 --> 04:19:27.652
WELL THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT

04:19:27.718 --> 04:19:28.920
WE WOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER AND I

04:19:28.986 --> 04:19:30.788
THINK THAT THAT'S WHY IT WOULD

04:19:30.855 --> 04:19:32.089
BE BASED ON A WORKING GROUP IS

04:19:32.156 --> 04:19:33.858
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SIZE OF

04:19:33.925 --> 04:19:34.792
THE OPERATIONS.

04:19:34.859 --> 04:19:35.593
HELLO WHERE THOSE OPERATIONS ARE

04:19:35.660 --> 04:19:38.562
IN THEY ARE.

04:19:38.629 --> 04:19:40.731
AND THEN BEGIN TO LOOK AT WHAT A

04:19:40.798 --> 04:19:42.033
REASONABLE FEE STRUCTURES THAT

04:19:42.099 --> 04:19:44.535
YOU CAN COLLECT FROM THAT.

04:19:44.602 --> 04:19:46.003
I KNOW A A IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE

04:19:46.070 --> 04:19:47.138
IT'S ALL SPECULATION AT THIS

04:19:47.204 --> 04:19:49.073
POINT SO IT'S HARD TO COME UP

04:19:49.140 --> 04:19:50.207
WITH A NUMBER --

04:19:50.274 --> 04:19:51.642
I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF EXPRESS

04:19:51.709 --> 04:19:53.277
CONCERNS ABOUT WOULD THIS IMPACT

04:19:53.344 --> 04:19:55.546
VERY SMALL MICRO PRODUCERS.

04:19:55.613 --> 04:19:57.481
I THINK IT'S PRETTY REASONABLE

04:19:57.548 --> 04:19:59.016
TO SAY THAT WE DON'T LOOK TO

04:19:59.083 --> 04:20:01.619
THEM AS THE BE THE BACKBONE OF

04:20:01.686 --> 04:20:02.219
WHO WERE GOING TO COLLECT FEES

04:20:02.286 --> 04:20:03.154
FROM.

04:20:03.220 --> 04:20:03.955
AND THEY DON'T REALLY FALL

04:20:04.021 --> 04:20:05.723
WITHIN ANYBODY'S DEFINITION THAT

04:20:05.790 --> 04:20:07.658
I'VE SEEN OF A CONFINED ANIMAL

04:20:07.725 --> 04:20:09.860
FEEDING OPERATION.

04:20:09.927 --> 04:20:10.995
THE OF THOSE YOU KNOW THOSE ARE

04:20:11.062 --> 04:20:12.496
THOSE TERMS HAVE MEETINGS IN

04:20:12.563 --> 04:20:14.265
OTHER AREAS OF THE CODE IN AND

04:20:14.332 --> 04:20:16.133
ALSO WITH AN OPERATIONAL

04:20:16.200 --> 04:20:18.703
GUIDELINES OF OTHER AGENCIES.

04:20:18.769 --> 04:20:19.170
I MEAN FROM THE BOARD.

04:20:19.236 --> 04:20:24.308
OF THINGS WE MIGHT SEE.

04:20:24.375 --> 04:20:25.743
HELLO MORE TRUNCATED TIMELINE IN

04:20:25.810 --> 04:20:28.579
THE FULL ASSESSMENT TWO YEARS SO.

04:20:28.646 --> 04:20:31.315
JOAQUIN OF OF CHEST WILL MENTION

04:20:31.382 --> 04:20:33.351
THAT CLOSELY IT I THINK IT'S

04:20:33.417 --> 04:20:33.985
REALLY GONNA BE THE FIRST PART

04:20:34.051 --> 04:20:35.386
WILL BE THE WATER SYSTEMS THAT

04:20:35.453 --> 04:20:36.754
ARE FAILING AND WE CAN GET AN

04:20:36.821 --> 04:20:38.522
ESTIMATE OF THOSE THAT'S SO IT'S

04:20:38.589 --> 04:20:40.024
INFORMATION WE HAVE --

04:20:40.091 --> 04:20:42.126
I THINK CALI THE THE PIECE OF

04:20:42.193 --> 04:20:44.395
WOOD FOLLOW THEN THAT WOULD BE.

04:20:44.462 --> 04:20:47.231
LOOKING AT IT'S A GOOD BECAUSE

04:20:47.298 --> 04:20:47.832
IT'LL BE A MODELING EFFORT OF

04:20:47.898 --> 04:20:48.866
PRIVATE DOMESTIC WELLS THAT ARE

04:20:48.933 --> 04:20:50.601
IMPACTED BY KNOWN WATER QUALITY

04:20:50.668 --> 04:20:51.969
ISSUES ARE LIKELY BE IMPACTED

04:20:52.036 --> 04:20:53.270
THE NEAR FUTURE PROBABLY THE

04:20:53.337 --> 04:20:54.438
SECOND PIECE THAT WE CAN.

04:20:54.505 --> 04:20:57.441
DELIVER AND THEN THE LONGER TERM

04:20:57.508 --> 04:20:59.010
ONE IS ASSESSING WATER SYSTEMS.

04:20:59.076 --> 04:21:01.712
OF A LOT WORSE ISN'T UNDER OUR

04:21:01.779 --> 04:21:02.813
REGULATION THAT.

04:21:02.880 --> 04:21:03.881
MIGHT FAIL BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY

04:21:03.948 --> 04:21:05.883
A SUBJECTIVE REVIEW IN TIME TO

04:21:05.950 --> 04:21:06.417
DO THAT.

04:21:06.484 --> 04:21:08.085
A HOME IN A IN A FASHION AND

04:21:08.152 --> 04:21:10.421
THEN EVEN HARDER THAN IS THE

04:21:10.488 --> 04:21:13.224
STATE'S MALLS THOSE --

04:21:13.290 --> 04:21:13.758
FOURTEEN TO FOR CONNECTION

04:21:13.824 --> 04:21:14.658
SYSTEMS THAT.

04:21:14.725 --> 04:21:16.060
IT HAS NO INFORMATION ON SO

04:21:16.127 --> 04:21:17.328
WE'RE JUST GONNA BE VENTURING

04:21:17.395 --> 04:21:18.796
INTO GETTING THAT FROM THE

04:21:18.863 --> 04:21:20.031
COUNTIES.

04:21:20.097 --> 04:21:21.298
TRYING TO PUT ALL OF THAT.

04:21:21.365 --> 04:21:22.666
INFORMATION BECAUSE I ALMOST

04:21:22.733 --> 04:21:23.567
GUARANTEE EVERYONE OF THEM HAS A

04:21:23.634 --> 04:21:25.469
DIFFERENT SET OF INFORMATION ON

04:21:25.536 --> 04:21:27.138
THOSE SYSTEMS AND PULLING THAT

04:21:27.204 --> 04:21:28.305
TOGETHER AND TRYING TO TURN THAT

04:21:28.372 --> 04:21:29.740
INTO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL NOW

04:21:29.807 --> 04:21:31.575
BEEN A LONG STRANGE.

04:21:31.642 --> 04:21:33.277
ONE WALKTHROUGH TIMELINE IN ON

04:21:33.344 --> 04:21:34.545
YOU TO DO THAT.

04:21:34.612 --> 04:21:36.147
FOR YES SO I THINK --

04:21:36.213 --> 04:21:39.250
OUR GOAL FOR THE OF SYSTEMS ARE

04:21:39.316 --> 04:21:42.753
FAILING WOULD BE AROUND ARM.

04:21:42.820 --> 04:21:44.822
A PROBABLY EARLY FALL OF THIS

04:21:44.889 --> 04:21:46.624
YEAR.

04:21:46.690 --> 04:21:49.026
AND THEN ARM PROBABLY THE WATERS

04:21:49.093 --> 04:21:50.728
THE DOMESTIC PRIVATE WELLS IS

04:21:50.795 --> 04:21:52.496
PROBABLY GONNA BE WINNER.

04:21:52.563 --> 04:21:56.901
OF NEXT YEAR SO THE WINNER OF

04:21:56.967 --> 04:21:57.535
TWENTY TWENTY YOU'RE SAYING IN

04:21:57.601 --> 04:21:59.336
THE END THAT'S FOR ALL THE OTHER

04:21:59.403 --> 04:22:00.438
THREE PIECES OF THAT ALL THE

04:22:00.504 --> 04:22:01.572
PIECES WERE GONNA TRY TO

04:22:01.639 --> 04:22:04.241
COMPLETE BEFORE THE END OF

04:22:04.308 --> 04:22:05.776
TWENTY TWENTY AND YEAH.

04:22:05.843 --> 04:22:07.511
BUT THERE'S NO MODELING EXERCISE

04:22:07.578 --> 04:22:09.213
YOU CAN UNDERTAKE NOW DURING

04:22:09.280 --> 04:22:10.314
THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION THAT

04:22:10.381 --> 04:22:12.316
GIVES US ON OUR WE'VE ALREADY

04:22:12.383 --> 04:22:13.451
STARTED EVERYTHING'S UNDER WAY.

04:22:13.517 --> 04:22:15.653
AS FAST AS WE CAN GET IT WE DO

04:22:15.719 --> 04:22:17.021
HAVE SOME CONTRACTS YET TO DO.

04:22:17.088 --> 04:22:19.824
THE YES SO IT'S STARTED.

04:22:19.890 --> 04:22:21.792
WE HAD TO WORKSHOPS ALREADY ON

04:22:21.859 --> 04:22:22.960
TWO FACETS OF THIS WE HAVE

04:22:23.027 --> 04:22:24.195
ANOTHER WORKSHOP COMING UP.

04:22:24.261 --> 04:22:26.163
IN MAY THE WILL BE THE COST

04:22:26.230 --> 04:22:27.398
ESTIMATION PIECE AND THEN WE

04:22:27.465 --> 04:22:28.432
SHOULD BE ABLE.

04:22:28.499 --> 04:22:29.600
TO GET OUR CONTRACTS OUT AND GET

04:22:29.667 --> 04:22:31.068
PEOPLE WORKING RIGHT AWAY THE

04:22:31.135 --> 04:22:32.103
GOAL TO TRY TO GET SOME

04:22:32.169 --> 04:22:33.170
INFORMATION FOR THE END OF THE

04:22:33.237 --> 04:22:34.672
SESSION I MEAN NOW YOU WON'T

04:22:34.738 --> 04:22:35.139
HAVE THEM.

04:22:35.206 --> 04:22:37.141
FOR THEM SOME PARK PIECES WERE

04:22:37.208 --> 04:22:38.509
WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BEFORE THE

04:22:38.576 --> 04:22:39.810
END OF THE SESSION BUT WE WILL

04:22:39.877 --> 04:22:41.879
NOT HAVE A COMPLETE PICTURE BY

04:22:41.946 --> 04:22:43.347
THE END OF THE SESSION.

04:22:43.414 --> 04:22:45.049
ANY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE ON WHAT

04:22:45.116 --> 04:22:46.517
KIND OF INCREASE WE COULD SEE IN

04:22:46.584 --> 04:22:47.418
TOTAL NEED HERE I MEAN YOU HAVE

04:22:47.485 --> 04:22:49.086

04:22:49.153 --> 04:22:50.521
THIS POINT I MEAN.

04:22:50.588 --> 04:22:52.223
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW?

04:22:52.289 --> 04:22:54.391
YEAH IT WE DON'T KNOW WE WE KNOW

04:22:54.458 --> 04:22:56.060
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE DON'T

KNOW WE DON'T WE WE KNOW THE

04:22:57.361 --> 04:22:59.630
AREA.

04:22:59.697 --> 04:23:01.198
I GUESS I WOULD SAY THE WAY I

04:23:01.265 --> 04:23:02.733
WOULD CATCH IT IS WE HAVE.

04:23:02.800 --> 04:23:03.601
YOU KNOW THAT THE BLUE SKY

04:23:03.667 --> 04:23:05.069
ESTIMATE THAT WAS DONE

04:23:05.136 --> 04:23:06.604
PREVIOUSLY LAST YEAR --

04:23:06.670 --> 04:23:07.905
USE THE INFORMATION THAT WAS

04:23:07.972 --> 04:23:09.406
AVAILABLE AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING

04:23:09.473 --> 04:23:11.342
TO DO NOW IS SAY OKAY WE'LL WHAT

04:23:11.408 --> 04:23:12.676
WOULD MAKE THE ESTIMATE.

04:23:12.743 --> 04:23:14.278
SB NATION BETTER I WAS NOT

04:23:14.345 --> 04:23:15.212
AVAILABLE AND NOTS THE

04:23:15.279 --> 04:23:16.380
INFORMATION WE'RE SEEKING NOW TO

04:23:16.447 --> 04:23:18.482
ADD TO THAT COMPONENTS I REALLY

04:23:18.549 --> 04:23:19.617
DON'T HAVE A BETTER.

04:23:19.683 --> 04:23:21.018
ONE THEN THEY'VE ALREADY DONE

04:23:21.085 --> 04:23:21.919
WITH THE INFORMATION THAT'S

04:23:21.986 --> 04:23:24.622
AVAILABLE AND WE MAY OR MAY NOT

BE SURPRISED WITH WHAT WE GET

04:23:25.890 --> 04:23:29.193
YOU KNOW.

04:23:29.260 --> 04:23:30.594
VERY LAST QUESTION BEING DOES

04:23:30.661 --> 04:23:31.529
REMISS CHAIR IT JUST.

04:23:31.595 --> 04:23:33.197
MORE BROADLY HAVE YOU HAVE YOU

04:23:33.264 --> 04:23:35.566
BEEN LOOKING AT SORT OF OVERALL --

04:23:35.633 --> 04:23:37.568
IN THEM NEEDS WE DO A LOT OF

04:23:37.635 --> 04:23:39.003
BOND EXPENDITURES HERE BUT JUST

04:23:39.069 --> 04:23:41.739
IN GENERAL THIS SORT OF

04:23:41.805 --> 04:23:42.773
OUTSTANDING NEEDED IN.

04:23:42.840 --> 04:23:45.009
ALL OUR WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS

04:23:45.075 --> 04:23:46.744
WITHIN UNDER YOUR JURISDICTION

04:23:46.810 --> 04:23:47.945
OF YOU ALL BEEN SORT OF WHILE

04:23:48.012 --> 04:23:49.847
YOU'RE TRYING.

TO HONE IN ON THIS PARTICULAR

04:23:52.316 --> 04:23:53.817
ISSUE IS ALL FOR THESE VERY

04:23:53.884 --> 04:23:56.487
SMALL OUTLYING COMMUNITIES YEAH

04:23:56.554 --> 04:23:58.522
WE WE SORT OF LOOKING AT THE

04:23:58.589 --> 04:23:59.423
BROADER.

04:23:59.490 --> 04:24:01.192
THEY GIVE ALL THE ALL THE FUNDS

04:24:01.258 --> 04:24:03.794
IF EVER REVOLVING YOU KNOW FOR

04:24:03.861 --> 04:24:06.430
THE ROVING LOANS AND ALL THE

04:24:06.497 --> 04:24:08.499
GROUNDWATER CLEANUP MONEY THEY

04:24:08.566 --> 04:24:09.333
WERE MOVING THROUGH THESE BONDS

04:24:09.400 --> 04:24:10.601
DO YOU DO A GENERAL SENSE AND

04:24:10.668 --> 04:24:11.669
MAYBE FOR LA --

04:24:11.735 --> 04:24:13.504
AS WELL AS IT IS IT'S SOMETHING

04:24:13.571 --> 04:24:15.906
WE'RE SORT OF TRACKING GENERALLY --

04:24:15.973 --> 04:24:18.242
OUTSTANDING OWN M. COSTS FOR

04:24:18.309 --> 04:24:23.380
OVERALL SYSTEM NEEDS.

04:24:23.447 --> 04:24:24.949
AT THAT THE LESSON AT THE

04:24:25.015 --> 04:24:26.250
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

04:24:26.317 --> 04:24:27.551
AND NO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

04:24:27.618 --> 04:24:28.485
WE GENERALLY BEEN TRACKING.

04:24:28.552 --> 04:24:32.523
WE DON'TWE WE DON'T EVEN WHAT

04:24:32.590 --> 04:24:34.091
IT'S GONNA TAKE TO OPERATE AND

04:24:34.158 --> 04:24:35.092
MAINTAIN [inaudible]

04:24:35.159 --> 04:24:37.828
ALL THE THINKINGOF ALL THE

04:24:37.895 --> 04:24:38.796
OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE WERE

04:24:38.862 --> 04:24:40.464
BUILDING PURSUANT.

04:24:40.531 --> 04:24:41.599
TO THE VARIOUS WATER IN

04:24:41.665 --> 04:24:43.167
RESOURCES BONDS THAT WE'VE BEEN

04:24:43.234 --> 04:24:45.236
INVESTING IN OVER THE YEARS AND

04:24:45.302 --> 04:24:45.803
SO.

04:24:45.869 --> 04:24:46.136
WHAT OTHER --

04:24:46.203 --> 04:24:48.505
IN M. CHARGES WE MAY BE FACING

04:24:48.572 --> 04:24:50.708
IN THE FUTURE TO DEAL WITH THAT

04:24:50.774 --> 04:24:51.475
INFRASTRUCTURE IN ADDITION OF

04:24:51.542 --> 04:24:52.977
THIS -- WE

04:24:53.043 --> 04:24:55.412
TRACK THAT THE BOND EXPENDITURES

04:24:55.479 --> 04:24:57.481
VERY CLOSELY AND AND WE'VE

04:24:57.548 --> 04:24:58.816
REPORTED.

04:24:58.882 --> 04:25:00.517
MANY TIMES ON ON THAT BUT AS FOR

04:25:00.584 --> 04:25:02.886
THIS SPECIFIC OPERATIONS AND

04:25:02.953 --> 04:25:04.655
MAINTENANCE COSTS THAT WOULD BE

04:25:04.722 --> 04:25:07.191
ONGOING THAT ARE RELATED TO THAT

04:25:07.258 --> 04:25:08.792
CAPITAL.

04:25:08.859 --> 04:25:11.729
EXPENDITURES FOR THOSE MINES.

04:25:11.795 --> 04:25:13.364
NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT THERE

04:25:13.430 --> 04:25:14.565
MAY BE I MAY HAVE OTHER

04:25:14.632 --> 04:25:16.934
COLLEAGUES AT THE OFFICE THAT

04:25:17.001 --> 04:25:18.035
ARE WORKING IN THAT AREA.

04:25:18.102 --> 04:25:19.470
IT'S PRETTY HIGH LEVEL ANALYSIS

04:25:19.536 --> 04:25:20.537
BUT I THINK BE USEFUL JUST TO

04:25:20.604 --> 04:25:25.442
GIVE US A SENSE OF CONTACT HERE.

04:25:25.509 --> 04:25:26.043
FOR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE

04:25:26.110 --> 04:25:26.410
IN THIS CASE.

04:25:26.477 --> 04:25:29.113
WHAT ELSE WE GOT ON OUR PLATE?

04:25:29.179 --> 04:25:30.347
JUST FEEDBACK IN THE FUTURE HERE

04:25:30.414 --> 04:25:32.082
MISTER YEAH I AM AND I WOULD

04:25:32.149 --> 04:25:32.583
JUST NOTE THAT YOU KNOW

04:25:32.650 --> 04:25:32.883
[inaudible]

04:25:32.950 --> 04:25:34.285
MOST.

04:25:34.351 --> 04:25:35.853
WATER SPENDING IS LOCAL RIGHT

04:25:35.919 --> 04:25:37.388
AND I SO IT'S KIND OF HARD FOR

04:25:37.454 --> 04:25:38.289
US TO KNOW WHAT IS THE OPERATE

04:25:38.355 --> 04:25:39.456
MISSION OPERATIONS AND

04:25:39.523 --> 04:25:40.658
MAINTENANCE FOR ALL THE SYSTEMS

04:25:40.724 --> 04:25:42.059
THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE IN ALL

04:25:42.126 --> 04:25:43.360
THE MANY.

04:25:43.427 --> 04:25:44.862
WATER UTILITIES AND WHATNOT BUT

04:25:44.928 --> 04:25:46.263
THAT BEING SAID I THINK THERE AN

04:25:46.330 --> 04:25:47.598
AD -- MAYBE

04:25:47.665 --> 04:25:49.400
AT LEAST A PLACE WHERE.

04:25:49.466 --> 04:25:51.335
THERE MAY BE SOME HELP.

04:25:51.402 --> 04:25:51.802
SO IT.

04:25:51.869 --> 04:25:53.871
I'M JUST GONNA READ INTO YOUR OP.

04:25:53.937 --> 04:25:54.705
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HANDING OUT

04:25:54.772 --> 04:25:56.307
THE FUTURE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

04:25:56.373 --> 04:25:58.175
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AND

04:25:58.242 --> 04:25:59.610
STUFF LIKE THAT SO WE DO DO --

04:25:59.677 --> 04:26:00.878
AS PART OF THE THE DRINKING

04:26:00.944 --> 04:26:02.680
WATER SRF IN THE CLEAN WATER SRF

04:26:02.746 --> 04:26:05.316
A NEEDS ANALYSIS ON A CYCLE WITH

04:26:05.382 --> 04:26:07.184
U. S. E. P. A. AND THOSE.

04:26:07.251 --> 04:26:08.552
THOSE NUMBERS PRODUCE.

04:26:08.619 --> 04:26:09.787
KIND OF A TWENTY YEAR WINDOW OF

04:26:09.853 --> 04:26:10.788
WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENTS WE

04:26:10.854 --> 04:26:13.357
EXPECT. TO BE MADE IN CALIFORNIA

04:26:13.424 --> 04:26:15.125
AND WE CAN GET THOSE NUMBERS TO

04:26:15.192 --> 04:26:17.061
I'D I'D HESITATE TO GET HIM OFF

04:26:17.127 --> 04:26:17.594
TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I KNOW

WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED

04:27:10.647 --> 04:27:12.316

ON THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL.

04:27:13.851 --> 04:27:16.653
WE AGREED WITH THE GOVERNOR AND

04:27:16.720 --> 04:27:18.288
SENATOR MINING HAS LEGISLATION

04:27:18.355 --> 04:27:19.790
THIS YEAR IN THIS AREA WE AGREE

04:27:19.857 --> 04:27:21.625
WITH HIM THAT THERE IS A REAL

04:27:21.692 --> 04:27:23.861
PROBLEM IN THERE NEEDS TO BE A

04:27:23.927 --> 04:27:25.529
SOLUTION THIS YEAR.

04:27:25.596 --> 04:27:27.064
HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THE PROBLEM

04:27:27.131 --> 04:27:31.368
CAN BE SOLVED WITHOUT ENACTING A

04:27:31.435 --> 04:27:32.202
WATER TAX.

04:27:32.269 --> 04:27:33.070
THE WATER TAX IN THE BUDGET

04:27:33.137 --> 04:27:35.639
TRAILER BILL IS VERY SIMILAR TO

04:27:35.706 --> 04:27:37.074
THE ONE THAT WAS PROPOSED LAST

04:27:37.141 --> 04:27:39.576

AFFIRMATIVELY REJECTED THE BILL

04:27:47.684 --> 04:27:49.653
ON IN PART BECAUSE OF THE WATER

04:27:49.720 --> 04:27:51.121

04:27:51.188 --> 04:27:52.089
ON THE MERITS I'D LIKE TO MAKE

04:27:52.156 --> 04:27:54.491
QUICK A QUICK POINTS JUST THREE

04:27:54.558 --> 04:27:55.159
OF THEM.

04:27:55.225 --> 04:27:56.860
WE THINK IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

04:27:56.927 --> 04:27:58.195
TO TAX SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE

04:27:58.262 --> 04:28:00.431
HAVE TO HAVE IN ORDER TO LIVE.

04:28:00.497 --> 04:28:02.166
THAT'S DRINKING WATER THEIR TAP

04:28:02.232 --> 04:28:03.333
WATER.

04:28:03.400 --> 04:28:06.236
SECOND THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER

04:28:06.303 --> 04:28:07.704
TALKS ABOUT A RIGHT TO SAFE

04:28:07.771 --> 04:28:09.072
DRINKING WATER BUT ALSO WERE

04:28:09.139 --> 04:28:11.241
RIGHT TO AFFORDABLE WATER.

04:28:11.308 --> 04:28:14.845
IN THE TAX IN THE IMPLEMENTATION

04:28:14.912 --> 04:28:17.614
COSTS FOR THE TAX WOULD ADD TO

04:28:17.681 --> 04:28:19.082
THE COST OF WATER AND WORK

04:28:19.149 --> 04:28:21.552
AGAINST KEEPING WATER AFFORDABLE.

04:28:21.618 --> 04:28:22.152
SPECIFICALLY ON THE

04:28:22.219 --> 04:28:25.022
IMPLEMENTATION.

04:28:25.088 --> 04:28:26.056
THE WAY THIS IS PROPOSED WOULD

04:28:26.123 --> 04:28:28.525
HAVE THREE THOUSAND ABOUT THREE

04:28:28.592 --> 04:28:30.160
THOUSAND SYSTEMS IMPLEMENT THE

04:28:30.227 --> 04:28:31.261
TAX.

04:28:31.328 --> 04:28:32.930
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN MANY

04:28:32.996 --> 04:28:34.231
OF THOSE INSTANCES THEY WE NEED

04:28:34.298 --> 04:28:35.599
TO HIRE AT LEAST ONE STAFF

04:28:35.666 --> 04:28:37.167
PERSON FOR BIG AGENCIES THAT

04:28:37.234 --> 04:28:38.502
WOULD BE MORE THAN ONE STAFF

04:28:38.569 --> 04:28:39.369
PERSON.

04:28:39.436 --> 04:28:41.238
AND THOSE WOULD BE ONGOING COSTS

04:28:41.305 --> 04:28:42.639
THAT WOULD ADD TO THE COST OF

04:28:42.706 --> 04:28:43.540
WATER.

04:28:43.607 --> 04:28:45.209
THERE'S ALSO THE ONE TIME COST

04:28:45.275 --> 04:28:47.444
OF CHANGING THE INVOICES THAT

04:28:47.511 --> 04:28:49.713
THE BILLING SYSTEM THE SOFTWARE.

04:28:49.780 --> 04:28:52.683
WE'VE HEARD NUMBERS ON YOU KNOW

04:28:52.749 --> 04:28:53.917
FOR ONE SYSTEM IT'S A HUNDRED

04:28:53.984 --> 04:28:56.019
AND FIFTY THOUSAND A HUNDRED

04:28:56.086 --> 04:28:56.920
THOUSAND IS A COMMON NUMBER YOU

04:28:56.987 --> 04:28:59.289
HEAR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND I'VE

04:28:59.356 --> 04:28:59.923
HEARD A CITY SAY THERE'S IT'S

04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:01.825
NOT MILLION DOLLARS.

04:29:01.892 --> 04:29:02.626
JUST TO CHANGE THEIR BILLING

04:29:02.693 --> 04:29:05.429
SYSTEM WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THREE

04:29:05.496 --> 04:29:06.864
THOUSAND SYSTEMS TO IMPLEMENT

04:29:06.930 --> 04:29:08.565
THE PROPOSED TAX.

04:29:08.632 --> 04:29:10.067
THE IMPLEMENTATION COSTS

04:29:10.133 --> 04:29:12.903
SKYROCKET THAT WORKS AGAINST

04:29:12.970 --> 04:29:14.404
KEEPING WATER AFFORDABLE.

04:29:14.471 --> 04:29:16.373
IN THE THIRD QUICK POINT IS THAT

04:29:16.440 --> 04:29:18.008
THE BILL WOULD BE THE PRESIDENT

04:29:18.075 --> 04:29:21.078
FOR A STATE TAX ON WATER IN

04:29:21.144 --> 04:29:21.812
CALIFORNIA.

04:29:21.879 --> 04:29:24.214
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE IS A

04:29:24.281 --> 04:29:26.850
BETTER APPROACH SENATOR CAFIERO

04:29:26.917 --> 04:29:29.686

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE.

04:29:32.389 --> 04:29:34.124
IT WOULD CREATE THE SAFE

04:29:34.191 --> 04:29:36.326
DRINKING WATER TRUST AND THAT

04:29:36.393 --> 04:29:38.028
PROPOSAL CAN REPLACE THE

04:29:38.095 --> 04:29:40.497
PROPOSAL FOR THE WATER TAX.

04:29:40.564 --> 04:29:41.732

LOSING AQUA WOULD REQUEST THAT

THE SUBCOMMITTEE REJECT THE

04:30:12.129 --> 04:30:13.196
DISTRICT --

04:30:13.263 --> 04:30:14.464
GIVEN THAT THE ENTIRE ROOM IS

STANDING BEHIND ME I'M GONNA TRY

04:30:16.400 --> 04:30:19.202

REGARDING THE TAX --

04:30:24.374 --> 04:30:25.242
THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY WE

04:30:25.309 --> 04:30:26.777
HAVE AN OPPOSING LAST MINUTE

04:30:26.843 --> 04:30:28.278
POSITION ON THE BUDGET TRAILER

04:30:28.345 --> 04:30:29.947
BILL AS CINDY SAID --

04:30:30.013 --> 04:30:31.181
WE DO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE

04:30:31.248 --> 04:30:32.316
PROPOSAL THOUGH THAT WE THINK

04:30:32.382 --> 04:30:34.351
CAN ADDRESS THIS EXTREMELY

04:30:34.418 --> 04:30:36.520
SERIOUS ISSUE AND WE ACTUALLY WE

04:30:36.587 --> 04:30:38.889
SHARE THE GOAL OF ADDRESSING THE

04:30:38.956 --> 04:30:39.856
ISSUE.

04:30:39.923 --> 04:30:42.025
SB SIX SIX NINE CABALLERO IS A

04:30:42.092 --> 04:30:44.027
IS A VERY SIMPLE PROPOSAL WE

04:30:44.094 --> 04:30:46.029
HAVE A BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR.

04:30:46.096 --> 04:30:47.297
TAKING A PORTION OF THAT BUDGET

04:30:47.364 --> 04:30:49.066
SURPLUS AS A ONE TIME

04:30:49.132 --> 04:30:50.133
APPROPRIATION.

04:30:50.200 --> 04:30:52.135
SETTING ASIDE A TRUST INVESTING

04:30:52.202 --> 04:30:53.837
THAT MONEY IN USING THE NET

04:30:53.904 --> 04:30:56.106
REVENUE. TO GET OPERATIONS AND

04:30:56.173 --> 04:30:57.741
MAINTENANCE MONEY INTO THESE

04:30:57.808 --> 04:30:59.242
COMMUNITIES WHERE IT'S NEEDED.

04:30:59.309 --> 04:31:00.077
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CAPITAL

04:31:00.143 --> 04:31:02.713
INVESTMENTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO

04:31:02.779 --> 04:31:05.115
MADE TO MAKE OUR MAINTAINED AND

04:31:05.182 --> 04:31:06.450
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SAFE

04:31:06.516 --> 04:31:07.751
DRINKING WATER TO PEOPLE.

04:31:07.818 --> 04:31:09.086
IS IMPORTANT AND THAT'S THE

04:31:09.152 --> 04:31:10.420
ESSENCE OF WHAT OUR TRUST

04:31:10.487 --> 04:31:13.323
PROPOSE ONE SB SIX SIX NINE IS.

04:31:13.390 --> 04:31:14.958
I THINK IT HAS A LOT OF MERIT.

04:31:15.025 --> 04:31:17.160
NUMBER --

04:31:17.227 --> 04:31:17.928
ONE YOU KNOW AS SANDY POINTED

04:31:17.995 --> 04:31:19.563
OUT THE ATTACKS ON DRINKING

04:31:19.630 --> 04:31:21.965
WATER IS AT ITS ESSENTIALLY IS A

04:31:22.032 --> 04:31:23.767
REGRESSIVE TAX THIS IS HARD ON

04:31:23.834 --> 04:31:25.168
FOLKS.

04:31:25.235 --> 04:31:26.570
WHO ARE ARE LOWER INCOME WELL

04:31:26.637 --> 04:31:28.038
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU'RE AT

04:31:28.105 --> 04:31:29.706
OR BELOW FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL

04:31:29.773 --> 04:31:31.642
OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE IT?

04:31:31.708 --> 04:31:33.977
IT'S IT'S AN EXPENSE --

04:31:34.044 --> 04:31:35.278
AND SO.

04:31:35.345 --> 04:31:37.214
USING IT GENERAL FUND SURPLUS

04:31:37.280 --> 04:31:38.682
MEANS WE'RE USING PROGRESSIVE

04:31:38.749 --> 04:31:42.019
TAXES INCOME SALES TAX. TO TO

04:31:42.085 --> 04:31:44.287
ADDRESS THE SAME PROBLEM.

04:31:44.354 --> 04:31:45.656
THE BIGGEST CRITICISM THAT WE'VE

04:31:45.722 --> 04:31:47.157
HEARD ON THIS PROPOSAL FRANKLY

04:31:47.224 --> 04:31:48.258
IS THAT.

04:31:48.325 --> 04:31:50.327
IN THE GENERAL FUND IS NOT A

04:31:50.394 --> 04:31:52.362
RELIABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING.

04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:54.164
I I I WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT A

04:31:54.231 --> 04:31:55.432
MAN I WOULD DISAGREE ESPECIALLY

04:31:55.499 --> 04:31:58.268
IF IT WAS PUT IT ASIDE IT AS A

04:31:58.335 --> 04:31:59.703
ONE TIME APPROPRIATIONS.

04:31:59.770 --> 04:32:01.738
YOUR STAFF ACTUALLY POINTED OUT

04:32:01.805 --> 04:32:03.040
IN THE ANALSIS THAT.

04:32:03.106 --> 04:32:04.875
TAX HAS THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE

04:32:04.941 --> 04:32:06.276
DIVERTED TO OTHER PURPOSES THERE

04:32:06.343 --> 04:32:08.078
ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT THE THE

04:32:08.145 --> 04:32:09.379
FEE WILL ALWAYS BE USED TO FUND

04:32:09.446 --> 04:32:10.447
PURPOSES INCLUDING IN THIS

04:32:10.514 --> 04:32:12.582
PROPOSAL.

04:32:12.649 --> 04:32:13.150
YOU COULD ALSO SAY THE SAME

04:32:13.216 --> 04:32:13.984
THING.

04:32:14.051 --> 04:32:15.452
OF SB SIX SIX NINE AND IT'S

04:32:15.519 --> 04:32:17.554
PROPOSAL FRANKLY OR ANY OTHER

04:32:17.621 --> 04:32:18.822
PROPOSAL THAT WE PUT FORWARD.

04:32:18.889 --> 04:32:20.657
BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE THE

04:32:20.724 --> 04:32:22.192
CONFIDENCE THAT GIVEN THAT.

04:32:22.259 --> 04:32:23.493
WE WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER TODAY

04:32:23.560 --> 04:32:24.294
THAT THERE IS A MORAL

04:32:24.361 --> 04:32:25.629
RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS THIS

04:32:25.696 --> 04:32:26.997
PROBLEM.

04:32:27.064 --> 04:32:29.399
THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE TO

04:32:29.466 --> 04:32:30.500
SET ASIDE FUNDS TO HELP

04:32:30.567 --> 04:32:32.002
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES HAVE

04:32:32.069 --> 04:32:33.570

THIS ISSUE I THINK IT'S

04:55:13.529 --> 04:55:14.963
IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT.

04:55:15.030 --> 04:55:16.465
THAT THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT

04:55:16.532 --> 04:55:18.434
WORK DONE IN THIS AND THE BLUE

04:55:18.500 --> 04:55:20.002
SKY -- STUDY

04:55:20.069 --> 04:55:21.804
HAS BEEN REFERRED TO A COUPLE

04:55:21.870 --> 04:55:23.539
TIMES IT WAS REALLY ONE OF THE

04:55:23.605 --> 04:55:25.274
FIRST COMPREHENSIVE STUDIES TO

04:55:25.340 --> 04:55:26.575
TRY TO GET BEYOND --

04:55:26.642 --> 04:55:28.143
WHAT IS CURRENTLY REGULATED

04:55:28.210 --> 04:55:30.179
TODAY AND IT IS REALLY KIND OF A

04:55:30.245 --> 04:55:32.014
A GOOD PICTURE OF WHAT THAT

04:55:32.081 --> 04:55:33.248
SCOPE IS?

04:55:33.315 --> 04:55:35.918
HOW THE NUMBER CAME AROUND TWO

04:55:35.984 --> 04:55:36.785
HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION

04:55:36.852 --> 04:55:38.287
DOLLARS A YEAR WAS AN IDEA THAT

04:55:38.353 --> 04:55:39.888
YOU CAN'T?

04:55:39.955 --> 04:55:41.723
FIX ALL OF THIS AT ONE POINT BUT

04:55:41.790 --> 04:55:43.525
IF THAT IF YOU CAME AT IT WITH

04:55:43.592 --> 04:55:45.060
SOMETHING THAT WAS CONSISTENTLY

04:55:45.127 --> 04:55:46.361
AROUND THE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION

04:55:46.428 --> 04:55:48.163
DOLLAR RANGE THAT OVER A PERIOD

04:55:48.230 --> 04:55:49.131
OF TIME.

04:55:49.198 --> 04:55:51.100
COMBINED WITH OTHER EFFORTS LIKE

04:55:51.166 --> 04:55:53.702
CONSOLIDATION YOU COULD REALLY

GET YOUR HANDS AROUND THIS.

04:55:55.070 --> 04:55:56.972
THE HARDER STUDY FROM UC DAVIS

04:55:57.039 --> 04:55:58.407
WAS REALLY KIND OF THE PREMISE

04:55:58.474 --> 04:56:00.843
OF LOOKING AT THE THAT BALANCE

04:56:00.909 --> 04:56:02.778
OF THAT SEVENTY THIRTY SPLIT ON

04:56:02.845 --> 04:56:05.614
NITRATE CONTAMINATION AND OTHER

04:56:05.681 --> 04:56:06.915
NATURAL CONTAMINANTS AND OTHER.

04:56:06.982 --> 04:56:08.183
POLLUTANTS THAT YOU FIND IN

04:56:08.250 --> 04:56:11.753
WATER SYSTEMS AND SO THERE'S A

04:56:11.820 --> 04:56:12.888
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SOURCES.

04:56:12.955 --> 04:56:13.322
CREDIBLE SOURCES --

04:56:13.388 --> 04:56:14.490
THAT CAME TOGETHER TO KIND OF

04:56:14.556 --> 04:56:16.525
PUT THIS COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION

04:56:16.592 --> 04:56:18.060
TOGETHER AND IF YOU GET INTO THE

04:56:18.127 --> 04:56:19.862
THE WEEDS OF OF THAT TRAILER

04:56:19.928 --> 04:56:20.729
BILL.

04:56:20.796 --> 04:56:21.263
THERE ARE OTHER SECURITY

04:56:21.330 --> 04:56:24.032
MECHANISMS THERE'S AN ANNUAL

04:56:24.099 --> 04:56:25.467
NEEDS ASSESSMENT BY STAKEHOLDERS

04:56:25.534 --> 04:56:26.935
THAT WOULD BE A BROUGHT TOGETHER

04:56:27.002 --> 04:56:28.637
BY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES

04:56:28.704 --> 04:56:30.405
CONTROL BOARD THERE'S A CAP.

04:56:30.472 --> 04:56:32.307
ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE FUN

04:56:32.374 --> 04:56:33.041
THE COULD BE HELD AT ANY ONE

04:56:33.108 --> 04:56:34.543
TIME -- SO

04:56:34.610 --> 04:56:35.811
TO TO MAKE SURE THAT IT NEVER

04:56:35.878 --> 04:56:38.046
GOT TOO FAR OUT OF CONTROL I

04:56:38.113 --> 04:56:39.615
MEAN THIS IS A REALLY WELL

04:56:39.681 --> 04:56:41.116
THOUGHT OUT COMPREHENSIVE

04:56:41.183 --> 04:56:42.851
SOLUTION THAT ULTIMATELY WILL

04:56:42.918 --> 04:56:45.053
BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE

04:56:45.120 --> 04:56:46.522
THERE ARE PLENTY OF URBAN AREAS

04:56:46.588 --> 04:56:48.290
WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

04:56:48.357 --> 04:56:49.658

04:56:49.725 --> 04:56:51.059
DRINKING WATER THAT WOULD

04:56:51.126 --> 04:56:52.561
BENEFIT FROM THIS AS WELL IT'S

04:56:52.628 --> 04:56:54.363
THE RURAL AREAS THAT ARE GETTING

04:56:54.429 --> 04:56:55.264
THE ATTENTION.

04:56:55.330 --> 04:56:56.999
TODAY.

04:56:57.065 --> 04:56:58.367
AND WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE RURAL

04:56:58.433 --> 04:56:59.801
AREAS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

04:56:59.868 --> 04:57:01.203
GET IN A LITTLE EXTRA ATTENTION

04:57:01.270 --> 04:57:03.772
TODAY FOR THE INABILITY TO KEEP

04:57:03.839 --> 04:57:04.473
UP.
