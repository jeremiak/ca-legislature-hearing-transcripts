VOTE ONLY CALENDAR SEEING NONE WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCE BOARD. OIL AND GAS AND FORSMAN COMMUNITY PROTECTION- MISS QUIROZ FROM- ASSISTANT DIVISION CHIEF OF ENFORCEMENT DIVISION IS HERE OF. PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU- AGAIN MY NAME IS HEATHER HEROES I AM THE ASSISTANT DIVISION CHIEF FOR CARBS ENFORCEMENT DIVISION AND I'M GOING TO DISCUSS OUR PROPOSAL FOR OIL AND GAS AND FORSMAN AND COMMUNITY PROTECTION THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS REQUESTING A TOTAL OF SIX PERMANENT POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THIS INITIATIVE THREE OF THE NEW POSITIONS AS WELL AS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR IN CONTRACT FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR STAFF TRAINING TO FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON IMPLEMENTING THE INITIATIVE AT OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THESE POSITIONS AND CONTRACT DOLLARS WILL BE FUNDED BY THE OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL ADMINISTRATIVE FUND AT AN ANNUAL COST OF SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THE OTHER THREE NEW POSITIONS WILL FOCUS ON IMPLEMENTING THE INITIATIVE AT OIL AND GAS IMPORTATION REFINING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES THESE POSITIONS WILL BE FUNDED BY THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUND AT AN ANNUAL COST OF SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. CARBS THE FORTY AND RESPONSIBILITY IS TO DIRECTLY REGULATE AND ENFORCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SOURCES FROM OIL AND GAS FACILITIES. INCLUDING METHANE EMISSIONS AS PART OF CARDS METHANE EMISSION CONTROL WILL. AND TO SUPPORT AND OVERSEE AIR DISTRICTS EMISSION REDUCTION REGULATORY PERMITTING AND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS. LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING CRITERIA POLLUTANT EMISSIONS FROM OIL AND GAS WELLS. AND THEN CAL JAM REGULATES THE EXTRACTION OF OIL AND GAS FROM WELLS IN CALIFORNIA S. TO A FAST OIL AND GAS FACILITIES COMPLIANCE WITH AIR QUALITY REQUIREMENTS WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH CARDS OVERSIGHT ROLE. IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FORMAL COMPLAINTS RECEIVED BY CARD FROM LOCALS INCLUDING THOSE FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND TO COLLABORATE WITH THEIR DISTRICTS TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL AIR REGULATIONS ARE DELIVERING ON THEIR PURPOSE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS INITIATIVE WILL INCLUDE REGULAR INSPECTIONS AND REVISION I'M SORRY AND REVIEWS AT THESE FACILITIES. ALLOWING CARP STAFF IN CONSULTATION WITH RELEVANT REGULATORY AGENCIES TO PRODUCE SUMMARY REPORTS THAT DETAIL COMPLIANCE STATUS. MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROGRAMMATIC IMPROVEMENTS AND IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADDITIONAL EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. TO CLARIFY THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW PROGRAM BUT IS A REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT STAFF TO ADDRESS THE NEED AND OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY EXISTING RESOURCES. ARD CURRENTLY HAS ONE POSITION RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCEMENT AT WELLING GAS FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE BUT ONE PERSON IS NOT ENOUGH TO DO THE ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT AND OVERSIGHT WORK NEEDED TO EVALUATE COMPLIANCE ENSURE CONSISTENT AND ROBUST ENFORCEMENT OF AIR QUALITY REQUIREMENTS AND HELP IMPROVE PROGRAMS AS NEEDED. TO ENSURE PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION GOALS ARE ACHIEVED. EXAMPLES OF EXISTING PROGRAMS INCLUDE CARBS STUDY OF NEIGHBORHOOD AIR NEAR PETROLEUM SOURCES WERE SNAPPED WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE AIR QUALITY IN COMMUNITIES NEAR OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND INCLUDES A HEALTH ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED BY- WE HA. ALSO CARDS COMMUNITY ARE PROTECTION PROGRAM- FOCUSES ON REDUCING EXPOSURE IN COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY AIR POLLUTION. COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT NEW STRATEGIES TO MEASURE AIR POLLUTION AND REDUCED HEALTH IMPACTS. THIS FIRST OF ITS KIND STATEWIDE EFFORT INCLUDES COMMUNITY AIR MONITORING AND COMMUNITY EMISSIONS REDUCTION PROGRAMS. APPROVING THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP KERR BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THE COMPLAINTS CARP IS RECEIVING ABOUT OIL AND GAS FACILITIES AS WELL AS INCREASE TRANSPARENCY TO HELP BUILD TRUST BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND AIR QUALITY REGULATORS. THE RESULTS OF REPORTS REVIEWS AND INSPECTIONS FROM THIS PROGRAM WILL HELP TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS AT THE FACILITY LEVEL ANY POTENTIAL EMISSIONS SOURCES IDENTIFIED THROUGH MONITORING AND CONCERNS RAISED TO CARVE THROUGH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. TO PAINT A PICTURE OF WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE HARDSTAFF RECENTLY CONDUCTED JOINT INSPECTIONS WITH LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS STOP IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND FOR OIL AND GAS FIELDS NEAR THE CITIES THESE INSPECTIONS CARP STAFF NOTED THREE WEEKS IN EXCESS OF ONE THOUSAND PARTS PER MILLION METHANE AND IDENTIFIED EQUIPMENT OPERATING ON SITE THAT WAS NOT COVERED BY LOCAL DISTRICT PERMIT. CARDSTOCK FOR THESE ISSUES TO THE LOCAL DISTRICT WHO ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION. TO BE CLEAR CARP IS NOT SEEN THE DISTRICTS ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOBS CARP AND THE DISTRICTS HAVE SEPARATE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT NEED TO BE PROPERLY ENFORCED. AND CARD HAS A STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE DISTRICTS IN THEIR WORK. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE NEEDED RESOURCES TO INCREASE OUR ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES IN ORDER TO SERVE AND PROTECT CALIFORNIANS. FROM HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION BY ENSURING THAT STATE AND LOCAL POLICIES ARE DELIVERING BENEFITS AS THEY WERE INTENDED TO. THANK YOU AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. DON'T GO ANYWHERE BECAUSE I'M SURE WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS SO. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. HISTORICALLY TRADITIONALLY. WE HAVE THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS DEAL WITH STATIONERY'S POLLUTANTS. IN THE OF. CARBON HERE IN SACRAMENTO DEALS WITH MOBILE OF POLLUTANTS CAN YOU. TO THE- REQUESTS FOR THE SIX ADDITIONAL STEPS. YEAH HI GOOD MORNING MISTER TURNER MEMBERS ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- SO WE DO HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL I THINK FIRST OFF OVERALL WE THINK THAT ENSURING THE BOARD HAS ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION PARTICULARLY IN HEAVILY POLLUTED COMMUNITIES HAS MERIT. SO WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE UNDERLYING GOALS THE CARDS TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS PROPOSAL. HOWEVER WE DO THINK THE PROPOSAL RAISES SOME IMPORTANT QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER- PARTICULARLY RELATED TO PRIORITIZING RESOURCES WHY EXISTING RESOURCES ARE INSUFFICIENT CHEN. AS THE TERMINATIONS OR WHO SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE EFFORTS WE HAVE THREE MAIN SETS OF QUESTIONS THAT WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE COMMITTEE ASKING MINISTRATIONS REPORT AT AND IN THIS HEARING AND SO THE FIRST IS. WHY SHOULD THE STATE FOCUS OF LIMITED RESOURCES ON MONITORING OF OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION FACILITIES RATHER THAN OTHER SOURCES OF POLLUTION SO FOR EXAMPLE IN MANY HEAVILY POLLUTED COMMUNITIES MOBILE SOURCES SUCH AS DIESEL TRUCKS AND EQUIPMENT ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION AND SO. WE THINK ONE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS BUT AS THE ADMINISTRATION- ONE KIND OF FOCUS ON OIL AND GAS FACILITIES HAS SUCH A HIGH PRIORITY. THE SECOND- QUESTION WE THINK IT IS- WIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NEEDED- AND- AS AS THE BOARD MENTIONED IN ITS- INITIAL COMMENTS CAR PARTY HAS SOME EXISTING PROGRAMS AND STAFF RESOURCES DEDICATED TO SOME SIMILAR ACTIVITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING THE STUDY OF NEIGHBORHOOD ERROR- NEAR PETROLEUM SOURCES- BUT WHICH SAID THE BOARD MENTIONED IN ITS COMMENTS AS WELL AS EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN ACTIVITIES AND OTHER RESEARCH EFFORTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND EMISSIONS FROM. FACILITIES THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO ASK CARGO EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHY THOSE EXISTING RESOURCES ARE INSUFFICIENT- TO MEET ITS GOALS- AND THEN FINALLY IT- TO GET TO THE POINT THAT THE CHAIR JUST MENTIONED WHY CARBS SO IF EVEN. IF MORE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE. OVERSIGHT OF OIL GAS. IN THE- WHY IS CARBON ENERGY CONDUCT EFFORTS- GEN LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS TO HAVE THE- WERE. FOR READ. STATIONARY OF POLLUTION. INCLUDING OIL AND IS STILL AND SO FAR MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED A CAR BROTHER THEN LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS SO THAT IT WAS KIND OF OUR OUR COMMENTS ON THE- PROPOSAL SOME OF THE KEY QUESTIONS WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO. EXPLORE DURING THE HEARING AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU UP SOME MISTER BROWN. THE LOCAL DISTRICT HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THESE OIL FACILITIES AND WE HEARD THE TESTIMONY THAT THE CARB. DILLON RIGHT ALONG OR GET IT TO IN. THAT DAY THAT THE- WENT WITH THE LOCAL ARTISTIC IS. ARE THEY SAYING THAT THEY ONE THEY FOUND THIS WEEK THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ONLY FOUND IT BECAUSE CARP WAS THERE IN THE LOCAL AIR. DISTRICT WOULDN'T FOUND THAT WE COULD YOU HAVE YOU HAVE ANY. ANY EVIDENCE OR ANY INFORMATION THAT THAT THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS AREN'T DOING THEIR JOB ON REGULAR LEAKS THAT THEY WITH FINE. I MEAN I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A- CLEAR ANSWER TO- THE POINT YOU'RE JUST MAKING IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS WHATEVER KIND OF IDENTIFIED THAT. WEEK ANYWAYS AND TRY TO ADDRESS IT AND SO IT'S SORT OF THE- H. ARE A MAGNITUDE OF KIND OF DIFFERENT PROBLEM I THINK THAT IT'S KIND OF A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT FOR US TO. TO KIND OF WRAP HER HEAD AROUND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT. HE'S SAYING THAT THE WORKERS ARE SO FAR I'M KINDA. IT IS A- BIG PROBLEM AT THIS POINT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE BUT I THINK THAT'S KIND OF AN ISSUE THAT WE I THINK DON'T HAVE A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION. RIGHT NOW IN THIS PCP IN FRONT OF YOU DO YOU SEE IT AS DUPLICATIVE. ARE YOU IS IT CLEAR TO YOU THAT IT'S A GOOD DUPLICATIVE INSPECTIONS THAT THEY COULD DO THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO- OR IS IT COULD BE INDEPENDENT. INSPECTIONS AS A GOOD U. S. STATIONARY SOURCES. WHICH IS LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY BUT THEY WOULD DO THE INSPECTION. OR SET UNCLEAR TO YOU. THAT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR I THINK THE WAY. THAT- WE HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT IS THAT THAT- IT WOULD BE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHERE THE PARK STAFF WAS KIND OF GO ALONG WITH THEIR DISTRICT STAFF TO KIND OF MONITOR- ANY KIND OF CONDUCT INSPECTIONS ALTHOUGH BUT- YOU KNOW AND THAT'S A QUESTION YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK THE BOARD JUST TO CLARIFY EXACTLY KIND OF THAT YOU KNOW PRACTICE GOING TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR. YOU AND JUST THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING MR OCULAR- AT FINANCE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE THAT QUESTION OR DO YOU HAVE- WOULD YOU LIKE. TO GO BACK TO MISS QUIROZ. FINANCE YOU AIR YEAH YEAH GOOD MORNING GREAT AMERICA FROM THEIR FORMER FINANCE HOW WE ARE GOING TO- TURN THAT QUESTION OVER TO COURT YOU WERE WE ARE WE GET THAT THIS IS. ALLEGEDLY NOT A NEW PROGRAM AND THAT IT SAY YOU WERE DOING A JOINT INSPECTION AND ARE YOU I GUESS ARE YOU SAYING THAT FINDING THESE LEAKS WAS ONLY BECAUSE DUE TO CARP STAFF OR WAS THAT. JOINTLY DISCOVERED. IT'S NOT A QUESTION FOR ME YES YES YES I'M NO I'M NOT WE'RE NOT MISS IT SO THE WAY THAT THE WAY THAT IT WORKS SO THE DISTRICT HAS PRIMARY FORTY OVER CERTAIN POLLUTANTS- CARB HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO REGULATE GREENHOUSE GAS POLLUTANTS WHICH IS PRIMARILY METHANE FROM THE SOURCES- AND SO- AND THEN WE ALSO DELEGATE SOME OF THE A FORTY TWO AND FOUR STAR RANK TO LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS BUT NOT ALL THAT FAIR DISTRICTS DO THAT- AND SO WE ARE OUT AND HAVE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENFORCING OUR METHANE RULE- THE DISTRICTS ARE OUT AT THESE FACILITIES AND FORCING THEIR OWN REGULATIONS- F. AND THEN SO IF WE GO OUT WE OFTEN GO WITH THE DISTRICT. WE'RE BOTH KIND OF LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT THINGS- IF THE DISTRICT HAS DELEGATED AUTHORITY IF YOU'RE AN EMPLOYER YOU TO ALSO LOOK AT THE METHANE RULE WERE OUT THERE ARE OUT THERE WITH- ENSURING THAT WERE IN THE LOOP IN TERMS OF ON WHAT WE'RE FINDING- YOU KNOW ENSURING THAT WERE ALL CONSISTENT AND HOW WERE IN FORCE IN THE RAKES AND IDENTIFY IN THE WEEKS- IF WE IDENTIFY LEAKS THAT ARE WITHIN THE DISTRICT'S PURVIEW THEN WE LET THEM KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND AND THEY FOLLOW UP AND PURSUE WHATEVER ACTION IS NEEDED. SO GOING IF THIS PROPOSAL IS APPROVED YOU ANTICIPATE THAT YOUR STAFF WILL BE DOING THESE INSPECTIONS INDEPENDENTLY OF THE AIR DISTRICTS WE DO THEM SOMETIMES INDEPENDENTLY- IF FOR EXAMPLE A DISTRICTS NOT ABLE TO JOIN US AND WE DO REACH OUT TO THE DISTRICTS EVERY TIME WE'RE GOING OUT TO A SITE TO LET THEM KNOW WE'RE GOING AND INVITE THEM TO COME ALONG WITH US SO WE'LL GET TO THE HUNDRED SEVENTY COMPLAINTS YOU KNOW WE RECEIVED A REPORT THAT TALKED ABOUT NOTHING AND THAT AND THE CHALLENGE WITH MATH AND WE KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE WHOLE WORLD IS TRYING TO DO A LOT ABOUT METHANE. AND WE HEARD WE WERE LOOKING AT GAS FACILITIES AND WILL FACILITIES TRANSPORTATION AND IT WAS LIKE THREE OR 4% OF THIS OF THE STATE'S METHANE IS FROM. LEAKS AND THEN CITY 6% OF. PER IS FROM LIKE. AND THINGS LIKE TO. SO JUST FOOD FOR THOUGHT I'M CURIOUS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING COME OUT FROM CARP. ON VERY TIGHT GESTURES OR AMP IN THE AGRICULTURAL NOTHING ON LANDFILLS WHICH ARE A BIG SOURCE NOTHING ON FORGET PICKS THAT ARE ARE. ARE CREATING METHANE ABSOLUTE QUIET BUT THAT ON THIS SMALL LITTLE. 4% FOR OIL LEAKS- WE GOT A WHOLE A WHOLE NEW PROGRAM SO I JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE TO GIVE SOME TEXTURE TO. THAT THE BIGGER PICTURE- SO WHEN YOU RECEIVE COMPLAINTS HE SAID YOU THE TESTIFIED THAT YOU CAN YOU GET. YOUR RECEIVE A LOT OF COMPLAINTS A HUNDRED SEVENTY PEOPLE- THESE ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE FROM- THE RIGHT ALONG WHEN YOU WRITE THAT THAT WAS THAT YOU JUST YOU GOT SOME INFORMATION. BY WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE COMPLAINTS RIGHT NOW ARE THE COMPLAINTS DO YOU. TOSS THEM OR PASS THEM ON TO THE AIR DISTRICT WHEN SOMEBODY COME CALLS UP WERE- WITH THIS ONE PERSON THAT GETS TO RECEIVE SOME WHAT HAPPENS. BUT WE DO REFER COMPLAINTS THAT WE GET TO THEIR DISTRICTS- AND AGAIN WE DO HAVE ONE PERSON- DEDICATED TO OIL AND GAS AND FORSMAN AND SO THEY DO THEIR BEST TO INVESTIGATE. BUT WITH THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT WERE RECEIVING- WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO AT THIS MOMENT- TO INVESTIGATE IN DEPTH. ALL OF THEM- AND TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHY WE ARE RECEIVING THESE COMPLAINTS. BECAUSE RIGHT WELL. IT I GUESS THE QUESTION OF THE FOLLOW UP IS THAT IF YOU. YOU SAID THAT THE- DISTRICT YOU DON'T YOU'RE NOT IN THE CAME THAT THE OR DISTRICTS ARE DOING THEIR JOBS BUT IF YOU GIVE THEM THESE COMPLAINTS TODAY DID YOU GET SOME REPORT BACK THAT IT'S BEEN REMEDIED OR ANYTHING LIKE OUT OF THE OF OR SOME INVESTIGATION OR SOMETHING WE KNOW ABOUT THIS MORE WORKING ON IT. WHAT'S WHAT'S THE WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. WE DO COORDINATE WITH THEIR DISTRICTS WE DO ALSO STILL RECEIVE COMPLAINTS FROM COMMUNITIES. SO. THE NEW STAFF THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING. HOW MANY OF THOSE COMPLAINTS DO YOU THINK ARE GOING TO BE ACTION THAT YOU GUYS TO GET A TAKE VERSUS VERSUS GETTING MORE INFORMATION TO THE MAKING SURE THEY ALL GET PASSED ON TO THE AIRPORTS THE LOCAL AIRPORTS I MEAN WHAT. WHAT IS IT THAT YOUR STAFF IS GOING TO DO. SO I THINK WE INTO YOUR INITIAL QUESTION I THINK IT'S HARD TO KNOW- BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. SORT OF DIVING A LITTLE DEEPER TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ISSUES ARE- AND WHY WE'RE RECEIVING ALL OF THESE COMPLAINTS- BUT WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS. THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVE WE WOULD INVESTIGATE WE WOULD DO INSPECTIONS WE WOULD ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH OUR REGULATIONS AND ENSURE COMPLIANCE YOU KNOW COORDINATE WITH THE DISTRICTS. ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS- PURSUANT TO OUR OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR. REVIEWING DISTRICT PROGRAMS AND PERMITS AND MAKING SURE THAT- YOU KNOW THAT ALL OF THE AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS ARE ARE SORT OF HEALTH PROTECTIVE AND MEETING OUR AIR QUALITY GOALS. NOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THIS STAFF WILL BE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE THEY GET TO BE IN THE VICINITY OF THESE OIL. FACILITIES THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I. PROBABLY IN BOTH OKAY WE HAVE A SACRAMENT WE HAVE A STOMACH CAL LOCATION SO I THINK BEING IN BOTH LOCATIONS AND BEING ABLE TO SORT OF- EASILY ACCESS AND GET TO THOSE LOCATIONS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WOULD BE IDEAL. AND OUR IS THE TASK INCLUDING AN OVERSIGHT OF THE INSPECTIONS AT THE LOCAL M. DISTRICTS ARE CURRENTLY DOING NOW WE'RE SYSTEM TOTALLY COULD BE INDEPENDENT AS PART OF AS YOU CALL IT YOUR OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THE CARB STAFF IS GOING TO BE TAGGING ALONG WITH THE LOCAL INSPECTIONS WHEN THEY DO THEIR THEIR INSPECTION- AS PART OF YOUR OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OR YOU GOING TO DO BROWN I GUESS IT BE MORE AKIN TO AN AUDIT THAT YOU'RE GOOD TO GO IN AND INDEPENDENTLY WITH CARB STAFF. LOOK FOR THESE- LEAKS AND OF ANSWER THESE COMPLAINTS. WHEN THE WHEN IT INVOLVES THE DEBT PRIMARILY WE WOULD BE COORDINATING WITH THE DISTRICTS- AND GOING WITH THEM ON INSPECTIONS THERE MAY BE SOME LOCATIONS WHERE FOR EXAMPLE pDIRECT ENFORCEMENT OF OUR ON METHANE RULE- AND AGAIN IN THOSE INSTANCES WE- YOU KNOW. ALWAYS LET THE DISTRICTS KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING OUT ON SITE AND INVITE THEM TO COME ALONG- BUT IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE WE COULD POTENTIALLY BE GOING ON OUR OWN AS WELL. BUT WE DO ALWAYS CREAMY WITH THE DISTRICTS SUMMER THE DON'T YOU HAVE ENFORCEMENT STAFF TO- ASSIGNED TO THE AB SIX ONE SEVEN PROGRAM COORDINATE WITH THE SIX ONE SEVEN BUT IT'S SORT OF A BILL RELATED. CURRENTLY WITH THE ENFORCEMENT THAT WE DO ON ON MOBILE SOURCES- AND WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES WE HAVE THE ONE THE ONE P. Y. ON THE OIL AND GAS. SO IT'S YOU IT'S YOUR TESTIMONY THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS CANNOT BE USED TO SPOT INSPECTIONS AT THE SPOIL. FACILITIES RIGHT. THEY CAN'T GET NOW NONE OF THEM ARE AVAILABLE THAT'S THAT'S- BEYOND THEIR ABILITY OR IS IT WORSE HE JUST BEYOND THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE TIME. THEY'RE THEY'RE FUNDED TO DO- MOBILE SOURCE INSPECTIONS AND SO ABOUT IS THEIR THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IN WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE USED FOR YEAH BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A FLAVOR OF MISSION CREEP HERE THAT THAT. YOU WE'RE YOU'RE ALLEGING THAT ITS OVERSIGHT BUT THEN IT'S ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK THAT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WOULD DO THAT WE HAVE THE SEPARATION WITH THE HERE WITH THAT IT LOCAL AIRPORTS IN CARBS SO- THANK YOU FOR THAT. WE'LL PAUSE. AND I WILL. ASK MISS ROY TO CALL THE ROLL TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. WHY CASKEY HERE I KASKY HERE DOLLY DOLLY HERE MCGUIRE. STERN HERE RIGHT THANK YOU WE HAVE A QUORUM- CENTER STONE YOUR QUESTION. COMING INTO QUESTION- BEEN LISTENING TO THE COLLOQUY HERE AND I GUESS EIGHT. TAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VIEW I'M I'M I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED HE JUST SPENT THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES QUESTIONING. ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO INCREASE OIL AND GAS OVERSIGHT WHEN THERE'S THAT ONE OFFICIAL WORKING AT THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD TO OVERSEE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY. ENFORCING A METHANE RULE- THAT IS WOEFULLY UNDER ENFORCED AND- EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE AIR DISTRICTS AREN'T GETTING THE JOB DONE ON THEIR OWN- POLLUTION RULES BEEN REJECTED BY THE EPA RECENTLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND TO CALL IT ANYTHING TO CALL IT SMALL IN A QUIET AND SMALL ISSUE- MEANS THAT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE A LEASE SO CANYON GO POISON TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE OR EVEN ALL OF SANTA MONICA BE SHUT DOWN YESTERDAY FOR TWELVE HOURS BECAUSE- THERE'S A MASSIVE GHASTLY- THIS IS HAPPENING ALL THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH PLAN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND IT MAY NOT BE A- BIG OF A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ISSUE. BUT IT IS ANYTHING BUT SMALL AND QUIET IN LA WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SITES THAT DESPERATELY ARE IN NEED OF INSPECTION THAT THERE WOEFULLY UNDER EQUIPPED. EITHER UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO INSPECT THESE SITES. AND I'M YOU KNOW I MIGHT MIGHT MY QUESTION OR MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. I DO THINK THAT THE AIRPORT IS GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE SOME SEMI INDEPENDENT. LEADERSHIP HERE IN. ADDRESSING THE GREENHOUSE GAS SIDE OF THESE FACILITIES THEMSELVES BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING- THERE ARE THERE'S METHANE LEAKING IN A PLUME ALL OVER. LOS ANGELES AND THE SOUTH COAST IS NOT BEEN ABLE TO TELL US WHY. INITIAL ESTIMATES FROM BOTH NASA AND UCLA HAVE SHOWN THAT THERE IS AN ACCUMULATION OF LEAKS FROM- THOUSANDS OF ABANDONED OR IDLE OIL AND GAS AND IT'S ALL OVER LA SO. THE NOTION OF PUSHING BACK ON A MILLION SEVEN WHEN WE'VE GOT A FORTY OR MILLION FOR WHEN WE'VE GOT A FORTY BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS ON OUR HANDS SEEMS TO ME. A LITTLE BIT MISSING THE BURNING FOREST FOR A TREAT- I WOULD JUST ASK THE AIRBOARD- IN IN LOS ANGELES ALONE. HOW MANY SITES DO YOU ANTICIPATE I MEAN IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE OVERALL METHANE FOOTPRINT OF A PLACE LIKE THAT WHERE. IT'S NOT JUST REFINING BUT LEGACY OIL AND GAS WELLS. HOW MUCH OF THAT WORKLOAD DO YOU THINK THIS. MODEST REQUEST IS GOING TO COVER. I YEAH I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT NUMBER ON THAT- BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY- SEVERAL SITES IN THAT REGION AND OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE THAT WILL BE FOCUSING ON- I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER FOR THAT. HOW MANY SITES DO YOU KNOW TOTAL NOT HOW MANY THIS WILL COVER BUT HOW MANY SITES. ARE THERE IN SAY THE STATE OVERALL THAT ARE THE TARGET OF THE METHANE RULE. FOR OIL AND GAS. I CAN GET BACK TO YOU I'M NOT- I DON'T HAVE THAT DIDN'T HUNDREDS OR IS IT IN THE THOUSANDS WHAT WOULD YOU SAY. DO IF IT'S OKAY CAN I CAN I GET BACK TO YOU I'M I'M GONNA SAY THOUSANDS- BUT I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER OFF HAND. OKAY ENDS AND IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO MONITOR- MONITOR THESE SITES I MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S A PUBLIC HEALTH RULE ALSO PENDING BEFORE CAL JIM WE'VE BEEN LOOKING IN OVERSEEING THAT ISSUE IN TERMS OF NEIGHBORHOOD OIL AND GAS DRILLING- WITH THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE. IS YOUR IS YOUR INTENTION HERE THAT OF ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY PROTECTION COULD DOVE TAIL WITH OVERALL ENHANCED MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH WHEN IT COMES TO NEIGHBORHOOD OIL AND GAS DRILLING. YES I DO THINK THAT- ALL OF THESE EFFORTS SORT OF COORDINATE AND- OUR PLAN IS TO COORDINATE WITH ALL- RELEVANT AGENCIES INVOLVED- WITH THESE FACILITIES OKAY WELL IF YOU COULD JUST GET BACK TO US I THINK IT BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW MUCH OF THE- HOW MUCH. OF THE STATE GOES ON INSPECTED RIGHT NOW. AND WHAT YOU THINK THIS THE SIX POSITIONS COULD COVER IN TERMS OF THAT TOTAL WORKLOAD I THINK THAT WOULD HELP WHILE. IF WE HOLD THIS OPEN TODAY ESPECIALLY TO MAKE A- A LITTLE STRONGER AND WELL PREPARED BETTER WELL PREPARED CASE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS A STRONG CASE TO BE MADE HERE BUT I DO THINK IT'S WORTH. FLESHING OUT THESE DETAILS AND I ANTICIPATE ONCE WE DO SO THAT WILL FIND THAT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOESN'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT THERE'S- INVISIBLE. AND UNDETECTED PROBLEMS OCCURRING ALL OVER THE PLACE THAT THE AIR DISTRICTS ARE SIMPLY UNABLE TO COVER SO WITH THAT I YIELD MY TIME. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN SO I'VE SAT ON THIS COMMITTEE NOW AND IT IS MY THIRD YEAR AND- WE HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF- PERSONNEL FOR CALOGERO AND WE HAVE. AGENCY WATCHING AGENCIES WATCHING AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA ALL WE DO IS TAKE TAKE THE CONTROL AWAY FROM THE LOCAL. AIR DISTRICT OR THE LOCAL PERMITTING AGENCY AND WE'VE CREATED QUITE FRANKLY YOU KNOW. MORE GOVERNMENT- BUREAUCRATS WATCHING IN IN NOT GETTING THE JOB DONE SO I ONE EIGHT I WANT YOU TO EXPLAIN TO ME. IF THESE POSITIONS WERE FILLED. ENGHIEN GIVE THIS THIS COMMITTEE SOME CONFIDENCE THAT SOMETHING'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN WE HAVE A THOUSAND. WELLS THE OIL WELLS IN CALIFORNIA WAITING TO BE PERMITTED AT KALYAN AND WE'VE INCREASED THE F. T. E.'S AT CAL JIM. EVERY YEAR IN THIS COMMITTEE BY. TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY POSITIONS BUT WE CAN'T SEEM TO GET THE JOB DONE SO CAN YOU CAN YOU TELL ME WHY I SHOULD SUPPORT THIS REQUEST- AND GIVE US THIS COMMITTEE SOME CONFIDENCE IN HOW THE HOW IT'S GONNA BE IMPLEMENTED ANDWHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA DO. TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT. RIGHT SO WITH REGARD TO THE AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS THAT THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS- EMPLOYMENT AND THAT CARP IMPLEMENTS- THERE ARE. WITH THESE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WILL DO- IS PROVIDE- RESOURCES TO DIRECTLY ENFORCE CARBS OWN METHANE REGULATIONS- PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE DISTRICTS- IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF IMITATION OF THEIR ROLES AND DOING THAT THROUGH OUR- STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITY TO. PROVIDE OVERSIGHT- WE HAVE ONE OF PERSON AT CARB BUT ABLE TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK IT'S NOT BEEN ENOUGH- WE'RE GETTING- CONTINUED COMPLAINTS ABOUT ISSUES COMING FROM THESE FACILITIES- AND SO THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE WAY FOR US TO- TO SORT OF BUILD UP NOT CAPACITY TO CONTINUE THIS WORK- AGAIN DIRECTLY ENFORCING OUR PROGRAMS. SUPPORTING THE DISTRICTS AND PROVIDING OVERSIGHT DO DO THE DISTRICTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE METHANE RULE. SOME DO THROUGH- DELEGATED AUTHORITY FOR ANIMAL USE THAT WE'VE ENTERED INTO I'M NOT ALL DISTRICTS HAVE ENTERED INTO EMILY IS WITH US- AND SO IN THOSE. PARTICULAR AREAS THE CARD IS- THE ONLY RESOURCE OUT THERE ENFORCING- THE METHANE RULES AND THEN WITH THE OTHER DISTRICTS THEY ARE OUT THERE WE ALL TO GO OUT THERE WITH THEM PERIODICALLY HOW MANY HOW MANY DISTRICTS HAVE- USE SIGNED A- MOU WITH AND HOW MANY HAVE NOT. SO THERE ARE A TOTAL OF THIRTY FIVE AIR DISTRICTS- I CAN GO BACK AND GET THAT NUMBER HAVE HAVE EMPLOYEES BUT THAT'S IT THE PRIMARY ONES DO- MORE OF THE WORLD DISTRICTS MAYBE DO NOT- BUT I CAN COME BACK WITH MORE. SO WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THE ONES WHO PROBABLY HAVE A METHANE. PROBLEMS ARE SIGNED UP WITH. I HAVE AN MO YOU IF YOU. SEVERAL OF THEM DO YEAH. SO THEY HAVE THE ABILITY THEN TO ENFORCE THE METHANE RULE. THEY DO. AND HOW MANY OF THOSE- OUR FUNDED. D. DOES THIS CAR ACTUALLY GIVE THEM FUNDING OR IS THAT FUNDING COME FROM THE LOCAL- MISSPELLED HIS OR OR GOVERNMENTS. LEAVE WITH PER PROVIDE FUNDING THROUGH THE AMMONIA. SO IF THEY IF THEY HAVE A MORE YOU WITH YOU AND YET AND THE PROVIDE FUNDING FORM WHY WOULD WE NEED THIS PROGRAM. BECAUSE WE ARE STILL RECEIVING COMPLAINTS THAT THERE ARE STILL ISSUES AT THESE FACILITIES- WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE ISSUES ARE FOUND TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS- TO ADDRESS THOSE. THOSE CONCERNS- THE COMPLAINTS THAT WERE RECEIVING HAVE TO DEAL WITH EXCESS EMISSIONS- HEALTH IMPACTS THAT COMMUNITIES ARE EXPERIENCING VOTERS YOU KNOW THINGS OF THAT NATURE- SO AGAIN THESE RESOURCES WILL HELP US FULFILL OUR ROLE- ENSURING THAT- THAT. OUR RULE IS BEING ENFORCED AS IT SHOULD WE HAVE EVER USED BUT WE RETAIN. YOU KNOW WE DON'T GIVE UP OUR RIGHT TO ENFORCE- WE RETAIN ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OF OUR OWN PROGRAM EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE AND WERE USED- AND THEN ALSO TO FULFILL OUR STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING IS BEING ENFORCED CONSISTENTLY. ENFORCED AS IT NEEDS TO BE- YOU KNOW COORDINATING EFFORTS PROVIDING SUPPORT TO EACH OTHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ISSUES AND CONCERNS ARE RESOLVED. A YOU TELL ME WHAT PART OF THE STATE ARE YOU GETTING MOST THESE COMPLAINTS FROM. I CANNOT SAY AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE THEY'RE STATEWIDE. THANK YOU. OKAY I'M- I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HAVE A HANDS UP WHEN YOU GIVE OUR RESPONSE TO THE PROGRAM CAN YOU INCLUDE HOW MANY STAFF DO YOU HAVE A SIGN TO DO- THE AB SIX ONE SEVEN PROGRAM AND ENFORCEMENT AND A LITTLE LITTLE FURTHER EXPLANATION ON WHY THEY CAN'T BE USED FOR THE FOR THIS OVERSIGHT FUNCTION THAT HAPPENS WITH CARBON BE GREAT AND WITH THAT. WE'RE GOING TO. HOLD THIS MATTER AND MOVE ON THANK AT THE AIRPORT- FOR THE PRESENTATION AND MOVE ON TO. ISSUE NUMBER NINE WHICH IS THE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES AND RECOVERY ALSO KNOWN AS CAL RECYCLE IN THIS IS THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING ECONOMY WITH CONSUMER RECYCLING CREDITS AND MARKET IN INCENTIVES- WE HAVE- TREKKER WAGNER AND HER STAFF THAT ARE AVAILABLE- THIS WAGNER YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION. ON THIS PC PCP. GOOD MORNING SENATOR WHITE HOUSE GATE AND MEMBERS AT THE PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU HERE TODAY AS I AS YOU STATED- I HAD I AM JOINED TODAY BY MY CHIEF DEPUTY AT MANY MCINTYRE AND I'LL JUST SLIGHTLY OFF SCREEN AT AT W. DIRECTOR AMY CAMERON WHO OVERSEES AND THE NEED BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO BE WITH YOU AT TODAY TO PRESENT OUR SPRING FINANCE LETTER PROPOSAL FROM ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO EXPENSE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. TO FACILITATE FAR GREATER ACCESS TO THIS PROGRAM AND TO PUT AT DOLLARS BACK IN CONSUMERS HANDS V. THAT THEY HAD THEMSELVES PAID ON THE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THEY PURCHASED AS YOU KNOW OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC CONSUMER HABITS HAVE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY ALLEN BEVERAGE CONTAINER PURCHASE CHAIN HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AS NOTED AND THE COMMITTEE'S AGENDA. THAT INCREASED AND- CONTAINER PURCHASING HAS RESULTED IN AN INFLUX OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM AND FIND AND WE THINK THAT THE BEST WAY FOR US TO UTILIZE THAT FUNDING AT THIS JUNCTURE IS TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT REALLY VERY QUICKLY IMPLEMENT SOME SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO OUR RECYCLING DESERT AND TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CONSUMER HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE THEIR C. R. V. BACK. I'M GOING THROUGH THE PROPOSAL AND WE HAD FIRST AND FOREMOST AND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS FOR THE- FOR- DEPLOYMENT I. RIVERSIDE AND MACHINES ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND VENDING ACROSS THE STATE AT. SUCH AS UNIVERSITIES- OR HIGH SCHOOLS AND TO YOU OUR PARTNERS- IN THE RETAIL. INDUSTRY ARE GROCERS TO TRULY PROVIDE REATER ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY TO THIS TECHNOLOGY AND IN A WAY THAT- CREATES A FAR GREATER ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM FOR OUR CONSUMERS- ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR MOBILE RECYCLING THAT WOULD HAVE. ALLOWED IT THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTRACT- WITH AND EITHER THE CONSERVATION CORPS IS THE LOCAL COURSE THE STATE COURT- OR PRIVATE CONTRACTORS TO DEPLOY A SOME FORM OF MOBILE RECYCLING THAT COULD VERY QUICKLY BE DISPATCHED TO AGAIN OUR RECYCLING DESERT IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR THOSE REGIONS. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE AS YOU KNOW THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR RECYCLING CREDIT AND THIS PART OF THE PROPOSAL WAS REALLY AIMED AT AT RETURNING THESE- DOLLARS AND SENSE BACK TO CONSUMERS- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MONEY BELONGS TO THEM THIS IS THEIR MONEY AND WE LIKE TO DO. TO GET IT BACK TO CONSUMERS AND WE THINK THAT PROVIDING THIS CONSUMER CREDIT IS AN INCENTIVE TO GO INTO THE INTO YOU AT THE TREASURE TROVES OF RECYCLING AND MATERIALS THAT AND BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR GARAGES AND BRING THOSE OUT. AND GET THEM RECYCLED SO CREATING A SHORT TERM PROGRAM BY WHICH WOULD HOPEFULLY BE AN INCENTIVE FOR CONSUMERS TO BRING BACK- THE BOTTLES AND CANS THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR GARAGES AND THEN WE. HAV ANOTHER- TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR NEW INVEST. TECHNOLOGY AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- AND WITH THAT SENATOR AND I HAD TURNED IT BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BROWN WITH THE L. A- DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION ON THE P. C. P. PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. HELLO AGAIN AS CHAIR MEMBERS ROSS BROWN WITH THE LA- WE DO HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL- SO WE DO THINK GIVEN RECENT DECLINES AND RECYCLING RATES AND CONSUMER ACCESS. TO RECYCLING OPPORTUNITIES AND A SUBSTANTIAL FINE BALANCE IN THE FUND WE THINK PROVIDING SOMEONE TIME FUNDING TO TRY TO IMPROVE PROGRAM OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A LOT OF MERIT. HOWEVER WE THINK THE SPECIFIC PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS HERE LACKS SOME KEY DETAILS AND RAISES SOME IMPORTANT POLICY QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. AND SIMILAR TO LAST ITEM ASTON MINISTRATION TO ADDRESS IMMIGRANTS DAYS SO NO RUN THROUGH SOME OF THOSE- KEY QUESTIONS WE HAVE FOUR OF THEM. SO FIRST DOES THE PROPOSAL ADDRESS A ORDERS OF THE SPECIFIC PIECE OF THE PROPOSAL ADDRESS A WELL IDENTIFIED PROBLEM SO CERTAIN PIECES SUCH AS THE AUTOMATIC RECYCLING MACHINES WE'VE BEEN CONTENT TO ADDRESS A VERY WELL KNOWN PROBLEM OF CONSUMER ACCESS TO. RECYCLING OPPORTUNITIES HOWEVER IN OTHER CASES. WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T CLEARLY IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM OR EXACTLY HOW THE PROPOSAL WOULD ADDRESS THE PROBLEM SO. FOR EXAMPLE- ACCORDING TO ADMINISTRATION THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT FOR THE TEMPORARY INCREASE IN C. R. V. VALUE- IS MEANT TO ADDRESS THE KIND OF LARGE NUMBER OF CONTAINERS THAT CONSUMERS PURCHASED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THAT ARE. ACTUALLY STORING. HOWEVER WE HAVEN'T YET SEEN MUCH KIND OF CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT CONSUMERS ARE STORING LARGE AMOUNTS OF CONTAINERS THAT THEY PURCHASED DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUT EVEN IF THEY ARE IT'S UNCLEAR HOW A TEMPORARY INCREASE IN THE BENEFIT ODING HER INTRODUCTION THAT WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE HEARD SO PRESUMABLY. CONSUMERS RESTORING BEVERAGE CONTAINERS WITH SOME INTENSE READING THEM IN THE FUTURE AND A TEMPORARY INCREASE IN THE C. R. V. ASSEMBLY SHIFT THE DATE BUT THE CONCEPT IN GENERAL ARE GAMES BUT HAVE VERY LITTLE IMPACT ON THE OVERALL NUMBERS OF CONTAINERS. THAT ARE EVENTUALLY RECYCLES. SO SECOND. QUESTION WE THINK HOW IF IS EACH PIECE OF THE PROPOSED ADDRESS- THEY PROBLEM IS BUT I- THE MINISTRY HASN'T PROVIDED. AND ABOUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH PROPOSED SIX. TO THE RECYCLING GOALS INCREASE IN RECYCLING RATE SOARING. IN AND THE LEGISLATURE WONDER UNITS. TO REPORT ON THE REGIONAL. EACH PROGRAM TO EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT GOAL. THIRD THIS RELATES TO THE- PREVIOUS POINT HOWEVER THERE IS A FROM THE- PILOT PROGRAMS AND FORM THIS PROPOSAL SAID THE COMMITTEE I'M IS AWARE OF HOW RECYCLE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING. FIVE PILOTS AIMED AT EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTION OPTIONS- AND IS PLANNING TO EXPAND BASED ON- BUDGET ACTIONS TAKEN LAST YEAR TO AN ADDITIONAL FIVE PILOTS- BUT THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THESE PILOTS YEAH AND SO THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANNA DIRECT ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT ON THE PROGRESS OF THOSE PILOTS. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES G. LESSONS LEARNED. AND HOW THOSE PILOTS HAVE INFORMED US- THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL ENOUGH IF NO RESULTS ARE AVAILABLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER. THE WAY. FUNDING AND SO MORE. IT'S AVAILABLE. AND THEN THE FINAL ISSUE OF IS DOES THE HAS ON TO HAVE SO THE LEGISLATURE MY WANT TO CAN WAYS TO TARGET FUNDING ACTIVE THERE ARE WE DON'T ON THE REST LIKE RATES AND RATHER THAN THIS ONE TIME BUT- WE THINK THAT SOME OF THE IN PROPOSAL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE RECYCLING ON AN ONGOING BASIS SUCH AS THE AUTOMATIC RECYCLING MACHINES IN SUPERMARKETS- PROVIDING LOANS TO RECYCLERS I CAN BE FORGIVEN IF THE RECYCLER OPERATES FOR A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME. IN OTHER CASES SUCH AS THAT THE INCREASED TEMPORARY C. R. B. VALUE THE PROPOSAL WOULD LIKELY YIELD ONLY A LIMITED TERM RESULTS AND SO LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO- DIRECT ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON WHICH PROGRAMS ARE MOST LIKELY TO HAVE THOSE LONG TERM RECYCLING BENEFITS AND PERHAPS FOCUS FUNDING PRIMARILY ON THOSE TYPES OF EFFORTS SO THAT SO THAT- IN MY COMMENTS THERE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. VERY GOOD I'M SUPPOSED TO OCCASIONALLY ANNOUNCED THAT THE PUBLIC CALL IN NUMBER IS IS FOURTEEN ONE ONE ONE FOUR ZERO- FINANCE YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD- GIVEN. MR BROWN'S COMMENTS. YEAH THANK YOU CHAIR BECAUSE HE A MEMBER THIS IS BALE WITH THE- OF- I DO LIKE TO ASK THAT THE IN. HAS REVIEWED AND ANALYZED THE SIXTY BALANCE. AND HAS INCLUDED A THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OF CRIMINOLOGY SHE OF RESOURCES FROM THE EXISTING BALANCE BCRF. THE CURRENT ESTIMATED FUND BALANCE FOR BCRF IS APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IF THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES THIS PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THAT VCR UP WILL MAINTAIN A PRUDENT LEVEL OF PROJECTED FUND BALANCE FOR THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE BUDGET YEAR. APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OTHER THAN THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF NUMBERS. YEAH MISTER L. TWENTY CENTER STAGE DE THAT. WHAT THE MAXIMUM CAN BE IN THIS FUND BALANCE FAMILIAR WITH THAT OVER THERE IN FINANCE. I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION FOURTEEN. FIVE EIGHT ZERO I BELIEVE OF ANY RENT TO SEIZE A PARENTHESES TO PROTECT. YES AND I THINK I'LL FOR RESEARCH- FOR K. WHICH SHALL NOT BE GREATER WELL THAT'S INTERESTING SHALL NOT BE GREATER THAN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO FIVE PERCENT. OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID TO PROCESSORS DURING THE PRECEDING CALENDAR YEAR SO WE GOT SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION AND YOU'RE AT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY WALK US THROUGH THE MATH OF WHAT. HOW YOU'RE MAKING YOUR CALCULATIONS. HAPPY THE IT PROVIDES AN INSIGHT THERE AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ALSO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO YOUR STAFF AT A LATER POINT SO- FIRST AND FOREMOST BE LANGUAGE THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. THE 5% FOR THE RESERVE IS DIFFERENT FROM- LEGALLY DEFINED FOR AN EXISTING FUND BALANCE SO A RESERVE IS BASICALLY DEFINED AS A CONTINGENCY RESERVE THAT IS UTILIZED IN STEARNS CIRCUMSTANCES PARTICULARLY FOR WHEN THERE'S ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. AND IT IS. ACTUALLY ASIDE FOR THAT PURPOSE. THE EXISTING FUND BALANCE IS AN ACCUMULATION OF SIGNIFICANT REVENUES THAT ACCUMULATED OVER TIME COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT OF EXPENDITURES THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED. FOR THOSE YEARS AND SO FOR THAT PURPOSE THAT DIFFERENCE IN THAT LANGUAGE DOES NOT NECESSARILY APPLY IN. THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. WELL A FEW MONTHS AGO THEY SAID THE RESERVE AT THAT TIME WAS FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION- AND- NOW THE DEPARTMENT REPORTS THAT THE FUND BALANCE IS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION WHICH IS AND- ROUGHLY A HUNDRED MILLION MORE. BUT YOUR CALCULATION YOUR BCP HASN'T CHANGED. AT LEAST AT LEAST WE GOT THAT NUMBER WOULDN'T SHOULD THERE BE AN ADJUSTMENT. EVEN GIVEN YOUR LIMITED INTERPRETATION OF THE 5% CONTINGENCY FUND. SO I PROBABLY WOULD JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT AGAIN THERE'S JUST THE NEW ONES THERE- IN TERMS OF A RESERVE AND A FINE BALANCE THE EASY P. DOES HAVE IT UPDATED AND MOST RECENT UPDATED BY THE VISION STATEMENT. WHICH IS- THE MOST RECENT ACTUAL NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR- AS WELL AS THE PROJECTED FUND BALANCE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR SO AS YOU NOTED THE NUMBERS IN THE B. C. P. ARE THE MOST RECENT NUMBERS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. AT THIS POINT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE MOST OF US HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE LOOK AT A MINIMUM REQUIREMENT CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE MAXIMUM REQUIREMENT THERE'S THIS IS AN ODD THING THAT YOU SAY THE MAXIMUM RESERVE SHALL BE YOU KNOW. 5% AND EVEN THEN YEAR EVEN IN YOUR CALCULATION IT WITH THE CONTINGENCY THE RESERVE LIMIT. DOESN'T THAT REQUIRE A DIFFERENT CALCULATION BY FINANCING BY THE CAL RECYCLE. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE I HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU I AND I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS AND HOW WE GENERALLY LOOK MOST OF THE TIME AT MINIMUM- VERSES MAXIMUM- BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WELL LET ME PUT A DIFFERENT WAY WHAT'S A HEALTHY RESERVE RIGHT WHAT THE HELL TO RESERVE WE HAVE YOU KNOW. THE- P. R. C. ONE FOUR FIVE EIGHT ZERO PRINT TO SEIZE A PRINCESS TO THE TALK ABOUT. CONTINGENCY WHAT DO YOU WHAT THIS FINANCE WHAT THIS IS SAID MINISTRATION THINK AS I HELP THE RESERVE- FOR PEOPLE'S DEPOSITS. THAT ARE BEING HELD. DO WE HAVE A NUMBER THERE. WHEN IT IS TIME FOR A MINIMUM RESEARCH FOR THIS ARTICLE I MEAN LOOKING AT IT DIFFERENTLY. IT OKAY- YEAH YES THEIR DRIVER PART OF FINE AND- DID YOU HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT HERE TO- SO. GENERALLY WORK FOR MANY DIFFERENT TACK TO FIND YOU KNOW WE THINK ABOUT LIKE- 5210% KIND OF YOU KNOW GOOD RESERVE RESERVE. HOWEVER IN CERTAIN CASES. WHERE THERE'S POTENTIAL VOLATILITY WITH EITHER THE LEVEL OF RAM YOU ALREADY PATRICK I'M TRYING TO TAKE A LOT MORE PRUDENT TO HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OVER THERE. IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN THERE'S I THINK YOU HAVE UNDERLYING FACTORS WHY WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS. A KIND OF MORE PRUDENT LEVEL TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A I RESERVE I THINK ONE IS. WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE REVENUES OVER THE COURSE OF ENDEMIC WE THOUGHT YOUR CONSUMER BEHAVIOR TECHNICALLY CHANGED TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE. NOW THAT THE CURRENT CONDITION THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT DOES THE FILM- CHARACTER AND LEVEL OF CONTINUED OUR BEHAVIOR LOOK AT THAT REVENUE FROM. THEIR PROJECTED CURRENT YEAR AND BUDGET YEAR THEY'D MAKE A PRETTY FLAT WHICH MEANS THAT WE ARE MOVING IN THE BUDGET YEAR WHAT THE SIMILAR TYPE BEHAVIOR. HOWEVER THERE STILL EMERGENCY AFTER AFTER WHETHER THAT WILL ACTUALLY CONTINUE AT THIS POINT BASED OFF OF THE DAY THAT WE HAVE- WE THINK IT COULD. BUT NOW EVERYTHING'S OPENING BACK UP AND BE OF PEOPLE MAY NOT BE BUYING IT MAY BORROW GOOD THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY SHAPE. SHIFT WHAT IT WHAT AT THAT AMPLE THAT AND THAT UNCERTAINTY OF. ALL REVENUE COULD CALL THE RELIEF IMPACT REFUND ABOUT AND THE THANK THE A THIS PROPOSAL- KNOW ONE OF THE BIG COMPONENT THAT THE INCREASE THE REDUCTION OPPORTUNITY. TO THEN BE ABLE TO CREATE ACCESS AND THEN ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO INCREASE OUR RECYCLING RATE WHICH INCREASED IN THE REFINERY IS IT'S GOOD BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET TO. B. B. AND YOU KNOW HE THANK ALL HOWEVER WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF AND I NEED AT THE FUND BALANCE. AND FLOW WOULD BE THINKING ONE TIME AND- ARE KNOW HOPEFULLY WHICH IS OUR GOAL CONNECTING- THE LEVEL OF YOU KNOW. REPEAT THE RV THAT WE GET OUT. WHICH IS GOING EIGHT THE FUND BALANCE IN MOST LIKELY A KIND OF THE OUT YOUR- AND WE'RE NOT BE TWO P. THAT. ARE SOMEWHAT FOLLOWED TILED- THE FUND BALANCE ARE BEING X. PRUDENT THAT LEAVING A HIGH LEVEL THIRD. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF WE DON'T AND THE YOU'RE EITHER REVENUE IF WE AGAIN. OR BE INCREASE OUR OUT- RETENTION RATE INCREASE AGAIN. THEN KNOW WE MAY GET A NEW AREA WHERE. WE'RE IT OR A REDUCTION. AND LOW. FOR THOSE WHO READ AND WE CAN GET CASE IT IS MORE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT LEVEL RATHER. LAND AND THE WITH KIND OF YOU KNOW ALL BUDGET- IS NOT EVERY IS SAYING. DONE WITH SOMEONE MISHAP FIVE I'VE NEVER MAKE MAKE THEN IN THIS CASE. IN MAKES SENSE THAT GIVER A LITTLE BIT MORE A BOOK. YEAH MISTER. THE WHY. WHAT'S A HEALTHY. IS HE NOW AND I WAS A LIE OF INFORMATION THERE- WE NOTE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A FUN BALANCE WE'VE GOT BACK AND FORTH I'VE BEEN FOR FIVE YEARS MANY OF MY- TO BE. HERE FOR FIVE YEARS IN THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT WHAT THE REPORT FROM BALANCES GOING TO BE MAY AND WHAT IT IS IN OCTOBER AND WE GO BACK IN. FORTH BOOK WELL I HAVE I KNOW MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS THAT THEY WANT TO ASK AND WE'RE GOING TO GO. TO THEM MISS. WEGNER DIRECT WAGNER WERE YOUR STAFF ON THE- ROAD YOU HAVE A COMMENT OR A AND AN- ON THE- I'M I'M EQUAL 25% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID TO PROCESSOR. 10% DO YOU HAVE WELL I YOU KNOW BECAUSE OLD HABITS DIE HARD SENATOR AND AT YOU KNOW AND READING OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT I THINK THAT THAT FIVE PERCENT. THE RESERVE FOR CONTINGENCIES WHICH SHALL NOT BE GREATER THAN AN AMOUNT EQUAL 25% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID TO PROCESSORS AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT GREATER THAN IS REFERRING BACK TO THAT SAID A LANGUAGE RELATING TO YOU CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED SO I THINK WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CRAFTED THIS LANGUAGE IT WAS INTENDED TO PREVENT THE AD DEPARTMENT. FROM BUT. I'M FROM AND- WHAT MAKES- HOLDING MORE THAN THE 5% SO I THINK IT'S FOR THE PURPOSE OF A DIRECT APPROPRIATION SO IT IS MAINTAINING THE LEGISLATURE'S APPROPRIATION CONTROL WHICH IS- SUB FEET THAT THE REST OF THE MONEY IN THE FIND AND ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT- RESERVE FOR CONTINGENCIES IS THAT LEGISLATORS TO APPROPRIATE NOT THE DEPARTMENTS TO- CONTINUE WITH. RESPECT MISTER BROWN DO YOU READ THAT. SECTION OF THE CODE THAT WAY. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE KIND OF A- SPECIAL KIND OF POSITION ON THE READING OF THE CODE BUT I DO THINK THE- THE POINT THE DIRECTOR WAGNER IS MAKING WE THINK IT'S KIND OF AN IMPORTANT ONE FOR THE LEGISLATION THE COMMITTEE TO BE THINKING ABOUT WHICH IS- ULTIMATELY WE THINK KIND OF THE OF THE LEGISLATURE OR SORT OF HAS CONTROL OVER KIND OF THIS. SPENDING AUTHORITY SORT OF EVEN WHAT THIS- KIND OF PIECE OF LANGUAGE IN PLACE. IT IS STATUTORY THAT CAN SORT OF CHANGE THAT- CHANGE CHANGE THAT LANGUAGE IF IT WANTED TO- BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I WOULD THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO SORT OF. ALLOCATE THE MONEY THAT IS IN THE FUNDS. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT KIND OF REQUIRE. LEGISLATIVE SPENDING AUTHORITY. TO DO THAT SO THE DECISIONS AROUND. HOW MUCH MONEY TO ALLOCATE AND WORD OF SORT OF ALLOCATE THE FUNDS ULTIMATELY WE THINK ARE KIND OF. THE LEGISLATURE. IN KIND OF GOING FOR DESIGNING SORT OF HOW BIG OF A FINE BALANCE OF WANTS TO KEEP AND WHERE IT WANTS TO- TO. ALLOCATE SOME MONEY TO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS. YOU CAN YOU CAN UNDERSTAND MY CONFUSION SINCE THIS SUBCOMMITTEE AND THE SENATE PROPOSED. BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE LAST YEAR TO EXPAND TO SOME MONEY INTO AREAS THAT WERE DESERT'S AND THAT WOULD WITH THAT. FINANCE AND CAL RECYCLE AND THE ADMINISTRATION WAS UNABLE TO GET THERE ON AN AGREEMENT- MR. A. CENTER DOLLY YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. YOU'RE FINE SENATOR MCGUIRE DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. SEVERAL PARTY RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN DO APPRECIATE REPRESENTATIVES WHO ARE ON THE LINE I THROUGH THE CHAIR I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO START WITH SOME QUESTIONS- TO THE DIRECTOR- MADAM DIRECTOR- WE'VE HAD OPPORTUNITIES ALONG WITH A CHAIR AND I TO BE IN A TALK ABOUT RECYCLING IN RURAL CALIFORNIA- YOU ARE MAKING. PROGRESS ON THESE RECYCLING CENTERS FOR EXAMPLE IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY- RE OPENING. A RECYCLING CENTER. TO THE PUBLIC CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT YOUR PROGRESS. ON YOUR SCREEN IN REGARDS TO RURAL CALIFORNIA THESE RECYCLING CENTERS IN THE IN OUT WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS PLEASE. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION ALLEN I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT AGAIN APPLIED AT THE CITY OF ARCADE AT THE COUNTY OF HUMBOLDT AND OUR PARTNERS AT THE COASTAL COMMISSION WE'RE REALLY WORKING THROUGH THE PROCESS I KNOW THE RECYCLING CENTER THERE AND ARCADA. AND AT HAS BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD OVER THE BALLOT THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO GET RE OPENED AND THEY JUST RE OPENED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO TO- RECORD LINES OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO REDEEM THEIR BOTTLES AND CANS AND SO IT REALLY JUST SHOWS THAT WHEN WE PROVIDE ACCESS. TO THIS PROGRAM THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY INTERESTS AND ARE THE RURAL PARTS OF OUR STATE AND SO I JUST REALLY AGAIN WANT TO APPLAUD THOSE WHO WERE A PART OF THAT PROCESS AND THAT REALLY HIGHLIGHT THAT YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS A CHALLENGE IT TOOK ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS FOR THAT CENTER TO GET OPENED AND WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE- AB. I A QUICKER TURNAROUND ON GETTING RECYCLING CENTERS OPEN AND PROVIDING GREATER LEVELS OF ACCESS AND IN FOR PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE I WOULD NEED A NEW RECYCLING CENTER MAY NOT. BE ABLE TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES HOW CAN WE FACILITATE AND AS YOU GUYS KNOW HE- PILOT PROJECTS WERE VERY MUCH INTENDED TO DO JUST THAT PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM AND PROVIDE THAT SERVICE. TO THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS- WE HAVE FIVE PILOT PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY RUNNING THEY WERE VERY SLOW ON GETTING STARTED BY NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN UNFORTUNATELY WE PASSED THAT STATUTE WE PASSED THE APPROPRIATION TO HELP THEM GET STARTED. AND THEN THEY WERE HIT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS LONG WITH THE REST OF THE PLANET EACH OF US INDIVIDUALLY WERE HIT WITH A PANDEMIC THAT IMPEDED THE ABILITY TO GET THOSE PILOT PROJECTS STARTED BUT THEY ARE NOW AS OF. TODAY ALL UP AND RUNNING AND TESTING SOME REALLY INTERESTING IDEAS AROUND. SOME FLEXIBILITY THAT WE CAN INTEGRATE INTO TO THE STATE. I FORGET REGION AND TIME. OF PEOPLE AND GEOGRAPHIC'S I HAD TO REALLY THAT PROVIDE A GREATER LEVEL OF SERVICE ACROSS THE STATE SO- AS YOU KNOW SENATOR AS YOU KNOW COUNTY HAS DONE A REALLY INTERESTING PILOT PROJECT WHERE THEY'RE WORKING WITH I THINK IS THAT FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT THIRDS DICTION. WITH IN ALBANY DID YOU TAKE BACK- AND IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET THAT STARTED THAT WAS A LOT TO ORGANIZE BUT THEY ARE NOW UP AND RUNNING AND WE ARE REALLY EXCITED AND OF AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE YEARS. BUT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THE OUTCOME OF THAT TYPE OF SYSTEM- THE PILOT PROJECT IN SAN FRANCISCO THE ONE AND IRVINE TO CULVER CITY. SAN MATTEO THEY'RE ALSO TETING SOME NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND NEW TYPES OF SYSTEMS AND FLEXIBILITIES IN THE SYSTEM SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY- PROPOSING IN THIS PROPOSAL. IS TO BUILD OFF OF SOME OF THAT. AND WHAT WORKS ADDITIONALLY SEEING. IN THE PILOT PROJECTS- AND USING SOME OF THE STATE REYES AND DEPLOYING THEM AT THE STATE LEVEL TO SOME OF THESE OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO DO IT THEMSELVES WERE ALSO VERY EXCITED TO SEE I THINK WE HAD CONVERSATIONS OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS. OUT WITH TEN ADDITIONAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE. LOOKING TO APPLY THE PILOT PROGRAM SO THERE'S A LOT HAPPENING IT'S JUST VERY EARLY DAYS. SO THEY JUST WANT TO GO INTO THAT AND THROUGH THE CHAIR AND I WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF SCRAP I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE SEEING- THROUGHOUT BUT- SAID. ONE OF THE SUGGEST BEING CANDID I THINK ONE OF THE WHY WE'RE SEEING SUCH A SIGNIFICANT SURPLUS. IS THE LACK OF ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS TO BE ABLE TO. TURN IN THEIR RESPECT RECYCLED MATERIAL. SO WE HAVE THESE KIND OF PROJECTS- MADAM DIRECTOR IF YOU CAN TALK ABOUT. HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO RE OPEN ON A MORE AGGRESSIVE BASIS. AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU COVERED HAS WREAKED HAVOC ON SO MANY AREAS INCLUDING. GETTING NEEDS RURAL CENTER IS BACK OPEN. BUT I THINK WHAT YOU SAID VERY ELOQUENTLY TO ME HE IS AT TWENTY OR PRIORITIES IS LOOKING AT. RE OPENING RECYCLING CENTERS AND INCENTIVIZING CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT GIVE US YOUR IDEAS ON THAT- IN IN IN PARTICULAR FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA. YOU REALLY HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE RIGHT YOU'RE EITHER THROWING A LANDFILL OR YOU'RE TAKING TO RECYCLING CENTER AND THERE'S NO IN BETWEEN. SO IF YOU CAN TALK ABOUT A BROADER ABOVE AND BEYOND THESE. KIND OF PROJECTS IN YOUR THOUGHTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO THAT'S - RIGHT AND AS YOU AND I ARE BOTH FROM A RURAL PART OF THE STATE AND AT PROBABLY IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF OUR LIVES. HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS AND SO I AM VERY VERY PERSONALLY. AS SENSITIVE AND AWARE TO THE CHALLENGES OF RURAL CALIFORNIA BUT IT ALSO EXTENDS TO URBAN PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE. PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS. TO TO RECYCLING CENTERS- WHERE AT THE PRICE OF REAL ESTATE IS REALLY HÌNH SAID THE CHALLENGES ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT. LOCATIONS UT GETTING A PERMANENT SOLUTION- FOR THOSE REGIONS THAT MAY NOT BRING IN. THE NUMBER OF BEVERAGE CONTAINERS TO REALLY MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATUTE AND MAKING BUSINESS. IS A HUGE CHALLENGE AND I THINK. HE'S BEEN PART OF WHAT WE SEE. IN RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE IS THEY'RE NOT BRINGING IN ENOUGH BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. TO MAKE THE BUSINESS MAKE SENSE AND I THINK. AS YOU KNOW TRANSPORTATION COSTS TO PROCESSING CENTERS THE COST OF REAL ESTATE ACOSTA PERMITTING THE COST OF. AS HAVING AND- EMPLOYEES THERE. THE FOR HOURS WHERE THEY'RE NOT BRINGING IN BEVERAGE CONTAINERS ARE ALL THINGS. THAT IF WE COULD IMPART SOME FLEXIBILITY INTO THE SYSTEM. WOULD AG. BE MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT THESE- RECYCLING CENTERS COULD SIXTEEN IN PLACES LIKE HUMBOLDT COUNTY LIKE MENDOCINO COUNTY- YOU COUNTY. ALPINE COUNTY SOME OF THE COUNTIES THAT WE KNOW ARE CONSTANTLY STRUGGLING- AND AB THIRTEEN ELEVEN LAST YEAR WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING THE COMPONENTS OF AB THIRTEEN ELEVEN SEVERAL OF WHICH WILL REQUIRE US TO DOT. REGULATIONS BUT WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO FAST TRACK THOSE REGULATIONS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THE FLEXIBILITY AND- HOURS. OF OPERATION- AT THE FLOOD. AND HAVE AND- TO BRING AND BACKDROP SO. IMPARTING SOME OF THIS FLEXIBILITY TO RECYCLING CENTERS I IN PARTS OF OUR STATE THAT ARE NOT GOING TO SEE THE CONSISTENCY OF HIGH VOLUME WILL HOPEFULLY ALLOW THEM TO HAVE A BUSINESS MODEL THAT MAKES SENSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND I THINK THAT- IN. AS YOU'RE DISCUSSING- CENTER DOLLY I JUST MADE A COMMENT AND I AGREE I THINK YOU KNOW GAME. HAVING ONE IS. OKAY BUT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BECOME- DIVERSIFIED IN LOCATIONS ESPECIALLY I MEAN WHETHER IT'S URBAN OR RURAL I THINK THAT IS THE GOAL AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS INTO OUR CHAIRS MOUTH. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT HE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO IS TO MAKE IT AS CONVENIENT AS POSSIBLE AND IF YOU'RE IN TRINITY COUNTY YOU LIVE IN HAYFORK YOU'RE MOST LIKELY NOT GOING TO DRIVE. AN HOUR AND TWENTY MINUTES TO GET TO WEAVERVILLE TO BE ABLE TO GO TO RECYCLING I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE CHALLENGE AND I AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE A COMMITTED TO THIS BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT THE PEACE THAT WE NEED TO E ABLE TO GET BACK TO. IT THE LAST THING AT MEADOW DR IF IT'S- ALRIGHT WITH THE CHAIR LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SCRAP- AGAIN I DON'T MEAN TO KEEP BEATING DRUMS SO- BUT IN RURAL THERE'S A LOT OF SCRAP METAL. ANDTHERE'S BEEN A REAL CHALLENGE TO BE ABLE TO REDEEM THAT RECYCLING CENTERS CAN YOU TALK ABOUT STRATEGY ON HOW WE CAN INCLUDE SCRAP. AT THESE RECYCLING CENTERS AND INCENTIVIZE CONSUMERS. TO BE A RETURN THAT AND- I'M SO THANK YOU QUESTION SENATOR. SO I WILL SAY AND THEN. CAN PRO IT'S- QUITE INTEREST. IN AND THAT. AT YOU KNOW TWENTY PLUS YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING IN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS I THINK. HAD THE MOST AT THE QUICKEST AND MOST INTERESTING IMPACT. ON AND ON AND- THE FLUCTUATIONS IN THIS PARTICULAR FIND IS THE PASSAGE OF AB SEVEN NINETY THREE WHICH WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KINGS BELL ON MINIMUM CONTENTS. AND REQUIRING MINIMUM CONTENT TO SCRAP VALUES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER PROGRAM HAVE ACTUALLY STABILIZED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS OR WERE STARTING TO STEVE'S DESTABILIZATION AND I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE- LEGISLATION LIKE SEVEN NINETY THREE THAT NOW REQUIRES A MINIMUM. RECYCLED CONTENT- I'LL AND IT PROVIDES THE MARKET THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY THAT THE CERTAINTY OF THAT PARTICULAR SUPPLY AND THE CERTAINTY THAT IT WILL BE NEEDED FOR THE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAT ARE BEING- BEING- AB RETURNED RECYCLED AND RE MANUFACTURED. I THINK ON THE BIGGER PICTURE AS WE ARE LOOKING AT BUILDING OUT RECYCLING CENTERS AND INCREASING THE TYPES OF MATERIALS THAT WE ARE BRINGING INTO OUR CIRCULAR ECONOMY I THINK IT WOULD BE AMAZING. IF WE COULD BUILD THAT DEVOS IF YOU WELL I'M MORE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATERIALS I KNOW ALAMEDA COUNTY HAS WANTED TO USE THAT IS JUST AMAZING DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS FROM REVIEWS TO RECYCLE AND I THINK. IT WOULD BE GREAT TO START LOOKING AT MODELS ABOUT HOW WE CAN PLACE THOSE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE SO THAT THAT SCRAP IN THOSE- THOSE. THINGS ARE OUT IN THE WORLD THAT- THAT PEOPLE ARE HOW A HARD TIME RECYCLING OUT WE COULD CONSOLIDATE AND BRING BACK AND THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO. TO BE OF GREAT BENEFIT I THINK CALIFORNIANS BUT THAT WE COULD WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON SO I'M AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING OUT THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY THAT BEAT BEING BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. IS FOUNDATIONAL TO CALIFORNIA'S CIRCULAR ECONOMY WAS OUR FIRST RECYCLING PROGRAM IT IS YOU KNOW RESPONSIBLE FOR REALLY SETTING THE TONE EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND REALLY USING IT TO BUILD OUT A FULL CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND GET. TO A PLACE WHERE EVERY CALIFORNIAN WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT THEY USE THINK ABOUT HOW DO I MAKE IT IT'S NEXT LIFE NOT HOW DO I THROW IT AWAY IS. OUR FOREMOST GOAL HERE CAP CYCLE. THANK YOU KNOW THIS CLOSE WITH THIS IN TURN IT BACK OVER THE CHAIR AGAIN I THINK- THERE'S BEEN AN URGENT NEED URBAN AND RURAL- I JUST TALK ABOUT RULE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I KNOW- AND- GRATEFUL TO BEABLE TO GET. THAT THESE RULES SOME OF THESE RULES CENTERS RE OPENED- THERE IS BEEN A PENT UP DEMAND IN NASA TRACTORS IN THE BEGINNING. THERE IS LITERALLY A TO OUR QUEUE. TO GET IN ONCE THE ARCADA FACILITY OPENED- AND- I DO WANT TO SAY- THE TRACTOR WAS INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH THAT AND JUST WANT TO SAY. THANK YOU FOR MOVING THAT FORWARD BECAUSE THAT. I WON'T SWEAR BUT IT WAS A BIT OF A SHOW GETTING TO WHERE WE WERE. ON INTO WHERE IT IS NOW SO DO APPRECIATE THAT. AND CAN I ALL. ADD I'M VERY EXCITED THAT. I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT WE HAD A- FINE AGAINST- CD ASK- AND WE AND ACTUALLY DIDN'T- AT COLLECTED THE FULL PENALTY IS WHAT WE DID IS WE WORKED WITH CVS. TO DEVELOP AND I SAT BY SEVERAL MENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO DEPLOY. AND ON THEIR OWN ADD TWENTY RBM AT VARIANCE CVS LOCATIONS ACROSS SOUTH AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ADD TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND WHERE THEY MAKE SENSE AT RETAIL THEIR RETAIL FACILITIES AND ONE OF THEM I BELIEVE IS. FOR TO NOT. WORKS FURTHER. I LOVE IT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INJECTOR THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. ONE K. WAIT TO READ TO FOR TURNER FOR THE COUNTY FAIR AND DROP IN THE CVS WITH THE RECYCLABLES- YOU KNOW THIS IS AN UNUSUAL PCP WE'VE GOT. ALMOST A THIRD OF A BILLION DOLLARS ON A ONE PAGE DESCRIPTION AND I KNOW ONE OF THE- THINGS WE WANT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO INCREASE FUNDING AND EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES. FOR INCLUSION IN THE CURRENT QUIT A PROGRAM FOR PLASTIC AND GLASS- COULD YOU PLEASE WALK US THROUGH. THE ACTIVITIES IN THE ITEMSTHAT YOU. I MEAN ON THAT ITEM THE EXPANSION AND- THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM PROVIDES HAVE HEARD SOME COMMENTS ABOUT IT NOT BEING- BEING BENEFICIAL AND WHAT. THE ADMINISTRATION HOPES TO ACHIEVE WITH THE FIFTY MILLION. IN SOME DETAIL. ABSOLUTELY SENATOR WELL THANK YOU- SO I'M- THE PROPOSAL AS IT'S TITLED REALLY GOES TO THE FULL AT CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND ONE OF THE COMPONENTS OF CIRCULAR ECONOMY OBVIOUSLY IS NOT ONLY COLLECTING. THE MATERIALS BACK BUT GETTING THEM BACK IN SUCH A WAY. THAT THEY ARE OPTIMALLY RECYCLED AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- AND THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE Q. I. P. PROGRAM IS TO INCREASE THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE MATERIALS THAT WERE GETTING. AS I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD AT BOTH HERE IN THE SUB COMMITTEE AS WELL AS FOR MANY YEARS IN THE QUEUE. AND THE AMOUNT OF GLASS CALL IT THAT IS COMING INTO CALIFORNIA'S GLASS ECYCLING SYSTEM IS- IS NOT MEETING THE DEMAND AND SO WE REALLY SEE- CREATING A HIGHER LEVEL OF INCENTIVE FOR HIGH QUALITY GLASS. IN THE RECYCLING PROGRAM AND REALLY TARGETING SOME OF THOSE MATERIALS THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A DEMAND FOR BUT THAT PERHAPS IS NOT THE HIGHEST. QUALITY OR IS THAT THAT IS NOT COMING AND THE AND THAT LEVEL AND THROUGH THE SYSTEM. TO REALLY CREATE AN INCENTIVE. TO DO BETTER IN. MORE OKAY IN THE B. C. P. THE EMPLOYMENT PLAN INCLUDES LANGUAGE SAYS HIGHER GRANT AND LOAN STAFF IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY- BUT THERE'S NO I DIDN'T SEE ANY P. WEISS INCLUDING THE PCP- SHOULD THERE BE SOME WISE OR IN AND IF SO HOW MANY. YEAH AND. ALL FIVE OF. I AT SENATOR WE THIS BECAUSE THESE ARE TIME FINE ARE NOT- ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL- THAT PERSONALLY YEARS WE ARE GOING TO REDIRECT EXISTING STAFF- TO HELP FACILITATE EXPENDITURE OF THESE FINE. OKAY I'M ALSO IN THE P. C. P. YOU LIST WATER REFILLING STATIONS WITH AN IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO BEGIN SOLICITING GRANT PROPOSALS HOWEVER I'D ADD ON THE ONE PAGE PROPOSED PROGRAM FUNDING- WATER REFILLING STATIONS ARE NOT LISTED IN YOUR CHART. IS OUR WATER REFILLING STATIONS PART OF THIS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION PROPOSAL WITH THE PEOPLE. THEY ARE NOT SENATOR OUT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THEM AND THEY WERE IN OUR TIMELINE AS AND I WILL TAKE THE BLAME FOR THAT I DECIDED TO TAKE THEM OUT. IS HE IN THE PARCHMENT INTENDING TO SPEND SOME MONEY ON THIS FUNCTION. NOT AT THIS TIME AND ARE OKAY ALTHOUGH ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM WAS INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE SO IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITH MIKE AND THE STAFF. HAPPY TO DISCUSS IT I AT AND IT IS IN THE ELEVENTH HOUR I MADE A DECISION. THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE PROPOSAL- THAT WE PUT FORWARD TO FINANCE INTO THE LEGISLATURE- FOCUS ON THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY BUT THAT. IS IN NO JUDGMENT OF THE VALUE OF. WATER REFILLING STATIONS. WILL THERE BE ANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS- TO MEASURE THE. SUCCESS OF THESE ONE TIME PROGRAMS THAT YOU HAVE. AND SENATOR WE'RE ALL. HAPPY TO REPORT WE DID NOT INCLUDE ANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE I IN IRAQ I. HAVE A LITTLE EMBARRASSED TO SAY THAT ANYTIME THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO TALK TO US I'M HAPPY TO COME AND TALK- I DO NOT SEE HIM ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AND- AND VALUE OF THESE FOR HER FAITH WHAT IS HOW WOULD THE DEPARTMENT MEASURE. THE SUCCESS OR OF THESE ACTIVITIES AND- YOU HAVE THE HUNDRED MILLION- VERSION FOR THE REDEMPTION THAT'S GONNA LAST FOUR TO EIGHT WEEKS- COMPARED TO. MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS THAT TWO MILLION TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO ESTABLISH- RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE APPEARS TO BE YOU KNOW THAT'S A BIGGER LONG TERM BENEFIT HOW WOULD YOU. MEASURE THAT SUCCESS OF THAT THE HUNDRED MILLION. IN THE- INCREASED. OF REDEMPTION VALUE. OR RETURN VALUE. YOU'RE SPEAKING TO THAT CONSUMER CREDIT- I THINK YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY SOME CRITERIA AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO DISCUSS THAT OUR OVERALL METRICS THAT WE- MEASURE SUCCESS. IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS PROGRAM IS HOW MANY PEOPLE HAD ACCESS TO THIS PROGRAM THAT DIDN'T PREVIOUSLY HAVE ACCESS TO THIS PROGRAM HOW MANY BEVERAGE CONTAINERS FOR WE ADULTS YOU- COLLECT THAT WE BELIEVE WE WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN ABLE TO- COLLECT- AND- AND WHETHER OR NOT CONSUMERS. FELT THAT- THEY HAD ACHIEVED WHAT WAS AGAIN I BELIEVE RIGHTLY THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEIR- THEIR REDEMPTION VALUE BACK OUT OF THEIR BEVERAGE CONTAINER. TO THIS DEPARTMENT HAVE A NUMBER I KNOW. AND I'M GOING BACK TO MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY BECAUSE OF THE COVE IT- THERE WAS. I HEARD REPORTS THAT THAT THE HAULERS WERE NOT RECYCLING ANYTHING BECAUSE OF HEALTH CONCERNS AND THEY WERE JUST TAKING EVERYTHING OFF TO THE- THE LANDFILL I DON'T I DON'T I CAN'T CONFIRM WHETHER THAT'S TRUE OR NOT BUT WOULDN'T THAT. AFFECT THE RECYCLING RATE IF THEY THINGS JUST WENT TO REGRETTABLY TO THE LANDFILL ADMITTEDLY FOR HEALTH REASONS. DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON THAT. WELL SENATOR AT. WE'D THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HEARD HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT NOT FROM CALLERS NOT FROM RECYCLERS SO I WOULD BE CURIOUS FOR THAT'S COMING AND I WOULD SAY- THAT WE ARE NOT SEEING IN OUR WEEK CHARACTERIZATIONS THAT WE ARE DOING AT THAT AT RIGHT NOW WHICH- WHICH WILL COME OUT. I BELIEVE. LATER THIS YEAR- WE ARE NOT SEEING RECYCLABLE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS- EIGHT AND INCREASED NUMBER OF RECYCLED FULL COVERAGE CONTAINERS SHOWING UP IN LANDFILLS WHICH IS WHY WE THINK THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE. THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON AT I JUST DIDN'T BRING THEM BACK TO RECYCLING CENTERS- BUT WE HAVE NOT SEEN A HUGE INFLUX OF BEVERAGE CONTAINERS IN LANDFILLS BUT WHEN THAT WHEN ARE WE FAIR THURSDAY XIN STUDY COMES OUT OF THE SURE TO. AND WE GET TO THAT- COPY IT WAS HARD TO SAY WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN TWENTY TWENTY TO RECYCLING CENTERS WERE CLOSED. AS WE ALL KNOW LIKE MOST OTHER BUSINESSES- AND AT AND- THE TRANSFER FACILITIES FEDERAL CLOSED WITH THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING IN OUR DATA COLLECTION- THAT PLAY OUT. SENATE W. HAD A FOLLOW UP QUESTION WELL I JUST WANTED. THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY. THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN IS ONE TIME SO WHO WHO IS THE INTENDED RECIPIENTS I MEAN AT ALL AND WHAT FACTORS WE PRIVATE. PARADISE IN PROJECTS TO FUND. SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SENATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH SO REALLY THE MAIN TENETS AND PRINCIPLES THAT WE EMPLOYED AS WE WERE DEVELOPING THIS PROPOSAL WHAT IS WE UNDERSTAND THAT CONSUMER BEHAVIORS ARE LIKE REALLY TO CHANGE AGAIN AND SO THIS WE ARE TREATING THIS AS ONE TIME FUNDING WITH AN EXPECTATION THAT THINGS COULD VERY WELL CHANGE IN SIX MONTHS TO TWELVE MONTHS AGAIN- BUT OUR NUMBER ONE PRINCIPLE WAS. THERE ARE AND ROUGHLY 42% OF THE CONVENIENCE DOWN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY SIR AND OUR PRIORITY IS TO SERVE EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA AND HAVE EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO UTILIZE THIS PROGRAM AND SO AS YOU WILL SEE- WE DEPLOY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF SYSTEMS. AND THE SECOND PRINCIPLE THAT WE- HAVE AT ARE ABIDING BY IN THIS PROPOSAL IS WE WANT TO DO IT NOW WE DON'T WANT TO- SPENT EIGHTEEN MONTHS ON EACH AND EVERY RECYCLING CENTER AS WE ARE PURSUING MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THIS IN THE SYSTEM AS WE ARE WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON STATUTORY CHANGES THAT GIVE GREATER FLEXIBILITY WE WANT TO HOPE TO PLAY SOLUTIONS. NOW OVER THE NEXT YEAR E WANTED TO FOR A MOBILE RECYCLING TO PLACES LIKE ALPINE AND TRINITY COUNTY WHERE A RECYCLING CENTER IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT. A RECYCLING CENTER AND NUMBER OF RECYCLING CENTERS WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DEPLOY SO IF WE CAN PROVIDE A MOBILE SOLUTION WHERE EVERY CALIFORNIANS CAN UTILIZE IT OVER. THE COURSE OF A MONTH- AND FOR THE YEARS TO COME. AND REALLY SHOW HOW THAT KIND OF SYSTEM COULD WORK FOR OUR WORLD PARTS OF OUR STATE THAT IS REALLY ULTIMATELY ARE. HOW MANY PROJECTS WITH THIS PART OF MONEY. EXPECT TO FIND. SO FOR THE MOBILE RECYCLING WE ARE PROPOSING SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND I THINK FOR BREAKING THAT DOWN REGIONALLY INTO FOUR REGIONS OF THE STATE WITH LIKE BE WHAT WE WOULD PROPOSE AND IT WOULD ALLOW US TO THEN AT. THE SAME TIME DEPLOYED ACROSS THE STATE AT FOUR DIFFERENT AT- SYSTEMS SO REALLY ULTIMATELY HITTING EVERY RECYCLING DOES OR IN THE STATE. THAT COUPLED WITH THE AD DOLLARS THAT WE ARE PROPOSING FOR REVERSE VENDING MACHINES AND AGAIN THIS IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY BEFORE EVEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO. WE WANT TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT- TEST THE THEORY- BUT ALSO PROVIDE ACCESS SO WE ARE PROPOSING ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND- TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND OF REVERSE VENDING MACHINES BEING DEPLOYED- WITH THE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS PROPOSED IN THIS- AND THIS PROPOSAL- OVER IT THAT NEXT YEAR OR SO- AND- I THINK. ALLOWING THOSE WITH THEN AGAIN FROM ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS- REALLY HELPING TO VERY VERY QUICKLY AND IMMEDIATELY DEPLOYED SOME SOLUTIONS FOR THE PLACES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ACCESS BUT I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE MOBILE RECYCLING AGAINST. OUT LIKE YOU'RE GROWING UP IN A IN A RURAL PART OF THE STATE TO YOUR POINT YOU KNOW THAT YOU YOU COULD BE IN ONE PART OF TRINITY COUNTY. AND THE RECYCLING CENTER COULD BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT CERTAINLY ISN'T CONVENIENT SO WE REALLY WANT TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT WE ARE PROVIDING ADEQUATE CONVENIENCE TO EVERY CALIFORNIA. AND WE ANT TO WORK WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- OUR RETAIL PARTNERS- IN FIGURING OUT SO LONG TERM SOLUTIONS THAT WORK FOR THE. POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SERVE. SO I JUST WANTED ARE CLOSED THE LAST. COMMENT I THE CHERUB UP THE REAR GOOD POINT IT. THERE SHOULD BE. REPORTING IN THIS THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY. AND WE NEED TO KNOW- YOU KNOW WHO'S GETTING THE WHO'S GETTING THE CONTRACTS AND HOW THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT. AND THEN HOW WHAT THE FACTS ARE- BECAUSE THIS ONE TIME MONIES AND IN SOME THE LIFESPAN TO SOME OF THESE PROJECTS OR- CREDITORS LIKE FORTY WEEKS. SO I THINK THE IT WOULD BE BEHOOVE THE- COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A REPORTING REQUIREMENT- PUT IN THIS. IT GOES FORWARD. OKAY LET'S LET'S PICK UP ON THE- SEVENTY MILLION TO ESTABLISH THE- MOBILE RECYCLING AND RURAL OR UNDERSERVED- WE DO HAVE A CURRENT PILOT PROGRAMS FOR. UP BOB MOBILE RECYCLING. WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THOSE PROGRAMS- AT CAL RECYCLE AND- HOW DO YOU SEE THEM BEING PLACED INTO THESE FOUR DIFFERENT REGIONS MORE. LESSONS LEARNED. SO I THINK THAT WAS A REALLY EXCELLENT I'M POINT THAT ROSTER BROUGHT UP AND OUR MOBILE RECYCLER IN AND IN CULVER CITY HAS BEEN OPERATING FOR. THEY'RE ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR LONGER AND LOCAL RECYCLERS I THINK CENTS TWENTY TWENTY AND SO FAR THEY ARE CURRENTLY SERVING INTO. A FOLDER CITY- AND- NUMBER OF CONTAINERS THAT THEY WERE DEEMED THROUGH THE MOBILE RECYCLING IS ROUGHLY FOUR AND A HALF MILLION- AYE CONTAINERS AYE RECYCLED AYE BETWEEN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY AND MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I'M SO I THINK IF THE QUESTION IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE OUR RECYCLING RATE SIGNIFICANTLY I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE SATISFIED WITH THE MOBILE RECYCLING OR ANY OF THESE OTHER SYSTEMS- I THAT WE ARE TESTING IN SOME OF OUR RECYCLING CENTERS IF THE QUESTION IS DID WE INCREASE ACCESS AND DO THE CONSUMERS- AND PEOPLE OF THAT LOCATION FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE GREATER ACCESS. I THINK THAT YOU WOULD GET A SIGNIFICANT ANSWER OF THE PEOPLE OF CULVER CITY HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PARTICULAR SYSTEM AND ARE LOOKING TO EXPAND SO I THINK YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS WORTH NOTING IN TERMS AND WE ALL KNOW THAT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAD VERY SIGNIFICANT DECREASES. IN THE NUMBER OF RECYCLING CENTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- AND THAT THAT THAT QUESTION CALLS INTO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE PROVIDED ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THIS PROGRAM BUT WHAT DID HAPPEN IS EACH TIME WE LOST HUNDREDS OF RECYCLING CENTERS OUR RECYCLING RATE ONLY WENT DOWN ONE TO THREE PERCENT. SO IT'S IN THESE AREAS WERE NOT NECESSARILY UP RECYCLING HUGE QUANTITIES IT IS REALLY JUST ENSURING OVERALL ACCESS TO A PROGRAM THAT EVERY CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO. RIGHT OKAY I MEAN BECAUSE NO CULVER CITY IS A DENSE POPULATION URBAN AREA AND YOUR PREVIOUS REMARKS ABOUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IN THE RURAL AREAS THE TRANSPORTATION COSTS THAT THAT THAT HAS TO GO IN AND THE SCARCITY. OF THE SCARCITY SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. ARE THERE LINKAGES BETWEEN THE PILOT PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE RUNNING RIGHT NOW THAT WILL DO BEST PRACTICES OR- IS THIS ENTIRELY. YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PROGRAM FROM ALL THE CURRENT MOBILE PROGRAM SAID THAT WE HAD. THAT IS A REALLY GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU CENTER I WE'RE GOING TO BE TREATING THIS OR WE WOULD PROPOSE TREATING THEM. DIFFERENTLY THAN B. FROM THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WERE RUNNING AT THAT ARE BEING RUN BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE STATE THIS IS- OF A FIRST FOR CALIFORNIA WOULD THAT WE WOULD BE CONTRACTING DIRECTLY. WITH RECYCLING AND ENTITIES- AND WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON IS HELPING BUILD OUT AND STATE AND LOCAL CONSERVATION CORES OUT REALLY BUILDING OUT A DEMAND FOR THIS KIND OF- AT OPPORTUNITY IN THESE REGIONS BUT WE WANT TO REALLY THE REASON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING FOUR. SEPARATE PROJECTS NOT PROJECTS BUT REPORT A DIFFERENT TEAMS IF YOU WELL AND IS REALLY YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING. FOR READING AND CRESCENT CITY I AND- I. JUST THE ENTIRETY OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO LOOK VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR SANTA MONICA OR ADD YOU KNOW USING THE EXAMPLE OF CULVER CITY AND SO WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO IS TAKE WHAT WE KNOW AT THE STATE LEVEL. ABOUT WHAT IS WORKING FROM THE PILOT PROJECTS BUT JUST IN GENERAL AND DEPLOYS SOME SOME IDEAS AROUND AND IT IN REALLY INSTITUTING SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITY. TO SHOW YOU ALL OKAY YOU NEED SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT IN CRESCENT CITY THAN WHAT YOU NEED AND FRESNO. SO HERE IS HOW WE CAN DEVISE- A SYSTEM THAT WORKS. FOR THE ENTIRETY OF CALIFORNIA PROTECTED THAT SOUNDS GOOD IT JUST IT CREATES SOME IT DOESN'T SEEM CONGRUENT WITH THE OTHER LINE ITEM FOR TWO MILLION THAT YOU HAVE FOR AUTHORITY TEN SENTIFI IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES THAT SORT OF. IT'S A LOAN NOT A GRANT AND IT WOULD SEEM LIKE IF YOU WENT OUT TO THESE AREAS SHE'S RURAL AREAS AND SOMETHING THINK SEEM TO. WORK YOU'D WANT TO HAVE THAT HAND IN HEY THE AUTHORITY SAY LET'S DO SOME MORE PER. OR YOU KNOW- TO YOU KNOW TO. SIR WRIST CENTER WE GOT LUCKY- SO THOSE TO THE TO THE- GIVEN YOUR EXPLANATION YOU WOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD WANT MORE MONEY IN. OTHER THAN TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR A LOAN VERSUS A GRANT OR SOME OTHER SORT OF INCENTIVE TO BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WHEN SOMETHING GOES RIGHT AND ONE OF THESE FOUR REGIONS. JUST A THOUGHT CENTER DOLLY HAS A QUESTION AGAIN. OKAY DO THEY HAVE THE FLEET REQUIRED FOR THE MOBILE SERVICES LIKE LIKE HOW MUCH- OF THIS WOULD GO TOWARDS ACQUIRING NEW VEHICLES AND UPGRADING EQUIPMENT TO MEET THE MOBILE SOURCE. AND HOW MUCH WILL IT IMPACT RECYCLING RATES- CARDS MOBILE SORT A SOURCE REQUIREMENTS. AND STILL ACTUALLY AT AS SENATOR BECAUSE WE WOULD BE CONTACTING FOR THIS WE WOULD NOT BE USING ANY OF THESE FUNDS TO ACTUALLY PURCHASE. ANY VEHICLES WE ARE LOOKING TO- CONTRACT. AND THE CONTRACTORS ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO MEET THE EMISSION STANDARDS IN MOBILE SOURCE IMPACTS OF CARP. ANY OTHER MEMBER OF AND INDUSTRY AND PLATE- THEY WOULD HAVE TO MEET ALL CURRENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS HERE. SO ON THE SEVENTY MILLION FOR THE RURAL AREAS ARE THOSE LOANS OR GRANTS THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE GIVEN OUT. FOR THE MOBILE THE MOBILE RECYCLING CORRECT THOSE ARE CONTRACTS OKAY THOSE CONTRACTS AND YOU YOU TO SUBMISSION FOR REGIONS SHOULD WE MOM IS THAT COULD BE FOR CONTRACTS OR IS THERE GOING TO BE SUBCONTRACTS WITHIN A REGION IN CALIFORNIA. STILL PART OF THE REASON I KNOW- RUSS'S YEARLY NOTED THAT THAT PART OF THE REASON THAT WE DIDN'T GO INTO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL ON THIS PARTICULAR PROVISION ALL OF THE P. C. P. IS THAT WE WANT TO DO A PUBLIC PROCESS THAT INCLUDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- RECYCLERS- AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO- CHIU AND MAYBE IT ENDS UP BEING FIVE REGIONS. THAT IN MY MIND I CAN KIND OF SEE THAT THE FOR BUT THE BEST WAY TO DEVISE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF THE RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE SO WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND DEVISE A SYSTEM THAT THAT WORKS. WHAT ACT THAT NOW WHAT FACTORS WITH CAL RECYCLE BE USING IN THE TERMINATING THE FUNDING. FOR THESE RECIPIENTS OR- HELLO. THE PRIORITIES FOR THE RECIPIENTS. WELL THE PERSON FOR MOST- FACTOR AND SENATOR AS WE DISCUSSED IS HOW IS THIS GOING TO PRODUCE- NOTICEABLE INCREASES IN- AND MEANINGFUL. AND INCREASES IN ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM- OR AS WORLD CALIFORNIA PRIMARILY IN THOSE RECYCLING DESERT-AND LIKE I SAID WE WOULD LIKE TO SET UP A PUBLIC PROCESS BY WHICH WE WOULD DEVELOP A CONTRACTING CRITERIA. WHERE WE WOULD THEN PUT THE CONTRACT OUT TO BID- BUT ALSO GIVING CREDIT BUT BY ALSO GIVING PRIORITY TO OUR CONSERVATION FOREST- AND THE STATE COURT. I'M ON THE LET'S MOVE TO THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE REVERSE VENDING MACHINES IN PARTICULAR THE FIFTY MILLION FOR HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. WHY NOT. WHY COLLEGES AND HIGH SCHOOLS AND WHY NOT YOU KNOW PUBLIC FORMS THAT HAVE A BETTER. OF BROADER SPECTRUM OF- OF FOLKS LIKE A LIBRARY OR COMMUNITY CENTER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE OF THE- ANTICIPATED. CHALLENGES YOU MAY HAVE ON GOING ON TO A- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SITE. IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU WELL IF WE DID NOT PROPOSED. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. BUT I THAT YOU THAT BECAUSE I IT WAS A CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH YOU WHERE- AND LIBRARIES WAS BROUGHT UP I DON'T I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT LIBRARIES. AND I THINK THAT'S A GREAT ADDITION TO THIS WHAT THE REAL IDEA THOUGH BEHIND UNIVERSITIES AND HIGH SCHOOLS AS THAT BECAUSE- THEY HAVE- TYPICALLY HAVE BENDING MACHINES ON SITE WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT. I F. AS A UNIVERSITY STUDENT OR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT AFTER YOU FINISHED YOUR BOTTLE OF WATER IF YOU COULD PUT IT DIRECTLY INTO YOUR OVERSPENDING MACHINE AND THAT THAT MONEY WENT INTO. A COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT THAT YOU SET UP OR DAY- HIGH SCHOOL COULD BE DOING SOME FORM OF CHARITY DRIVE AND PEOPLE COULD BE BRINGING. THEIR BOTTLES AND CANS FROM HOME AND DOING CHARITY THERE SO WHAT WE WERE REALLY DOING IS YOU KNOW ART THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ARE REALLY GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT LEAD THIS NATION AND EVERYTHING. BUT I REALLY IN THIS CASE THEY ARE VERY AT ENVIRONMENTALLY. AWARE AND WHY NOT BUILD ON THAT BY PROVIDING THEM THE TECHNOLOGY AT TO BENEFIT FROM THE SYSTEM SO WASN'T REALLY INTENDED TO HAVE PEOPLE WALKING ONTO UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES ARE HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES IT WAS REALLY INTENDED FOR THE POPULATIONS THAT ARE NORMALLY ON THOSE FACILITY FEEL LIKE THOSE BUT I LOVE THE IDEA. OF EXPANDING THAT TO OTHER PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS LIKE- LIKE LIBRARIES SO THE INTENDED REDEEMER WILL BE LIKE ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS JUST A COLLEGE STUDENT THERE'S. NO OTHER THERE'S NO OTHER. DO EIGHT. RIGHT RIGHT I MEAN IF YOU THINK I LIKE A I THINKING AS I. AND CITY COLLEGE. HOW MANY. OF RE COMING AND GOING FROM A CITY COLLEGE CAMPUS EVERY DAY AND WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF THEY HAD ACCESS TO THIS TECHNOLOGY RIGHT THERE. AGAIN THE IDEA OF EXPANDING IT TO OTHER PUBLIC FACILITIES YOU HAVE FIFTY MILLION FOR SUPERMARKETS- HOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT THAT FIGURE FOR SUPPORT THAT'S A THOUSAND MACHINES FOR ALL THE SUPERMARKETS IN THESE UNDERSERVED. RURAL URBAN AND SUBURBAN AREAS. SENATOR AS WE WORK I'M WORKING THROUGH THE DISCUSSIONS- WITH OUR- NOW PARTNER OVER AT CVS WE WERE LOOKING AT ALL OF THE PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE. NOT ADEQUATELY SERVED AND LOOKING AT ALL OF THEIR PARTICULAR SITE BECAUSE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THEIR SETTLEMENT BUT WE STARTED LOOKING AT GROCERS ACROSS THE STATE AND SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. AS A YOU KNOW A THOUSAND- REVERSE VENDING MACHINES AT GROCERY STORES IS A SIGNIFICANT DEPLOYMENT THAT ALLOWS US TO TRULY TEST WHETHER THIS TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE UTILIZED STATEWIDE. BUT ALSO- NOT SO OF SO MANY THAT WE WOULD. BE AT A STRUGGLING TO- PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT. I THE MILLION THE WE HAVE FOR YOU PROPOSE FOR START UP LOANS I'VE TALKED TO ADVOCATES AND DAVE KRIEG THEY'VE SHARED WITH ME A MODEL THAT- OF ENTERPRISE WOULD NEED SOMETHING IN THE ORDER OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH. FOR A THIRTY SIX MONTH PERIOD IN ORDER TO IN IN ONE OF THESE AS YOU ARE POINTED OUT IN ARCADIA ONE OF THESE CHALLENGED AREAS TO. BUY THE EQUIPMENT SERVICE A PROCESSOR AND GET AND GET THE TYPE OF IN THE SERVICE TO THE- COMMUNITY THAT'S THERE- AND YOU KNOW I. SORT OF. LIVE THE DREAM OF BEING A RECYCLER PROCESSOR IN THIS AREA- YOU GUYS. IT APPEARS TO BE THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS AS PROPOSED IN THE B. C. P. IS. A RATHER LOW NUMBER AND IT'S A LOAN FOR PARTICIPATION- COMPARED TO THE IN THE HUNDRED MILLION TO THAT REACHED RICHARD. HOW DID YOU LAND ON THAT AND WHAT TYPE OF RESULTS DO YOU EXPECT. WITH THAT WITH THAT TYPE OF MONEY. THE REASON THAT WE STRUCTURED THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF THE PROPOSAL THE WAY THAT WE DID SENATOR WHAT IS THAT WILL WIND IT IS LOANS BECAUSE WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE EXPENDITURE OF THE FUNDS. IS AT IT PROCREATE EXPENDITURE AND STATE DOLLARS AND SO IT IS A FORGIVABLE LOAN AS IT STRUCTURED BUT IT IS ALSO INTENDED TO BE A START UP COST AND NOT BE AN ONGOING SENSITISATION OF THE RECYCLING CENTER. ONE OF THAT I THINK CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE NOTING HERE IS THAT IT WOULD BE VERY SIGNIFICANT TO HOW THEY HAVE A RECYCLING CENTER. AND AT SIGNIFICANT COST TO HAVE A RECYCLING CENTER AT SUBSIDIZED IN SOME OF THESE AREAS AND REGIONS OF THE STATE AND AS THESE ARE ONE TIME FUNDS WE CAN'T CONTINUE THE SUBSIDIZATION. OVER THE LIFE OF THE RECYCLING CENTER AND SO WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT CAN'T SUSTAIN ITSELF SO THE INTENTION HERE WAS TO PROVIDE. A START UP COSTS AND FOR THOSE RECYCLERS WHO HAD A BUSINESS MODEL WHERE THE WHAT THEY REALLY TRULY NEEDED WAS FOR. START UP COSTS WE WOULD HELP SUBSIDIZE THE START UP COSTS BUT THAT THE BUSINESS MODEL INTO ITSELF WOULD HAVE TO WORK- I'VE ITS EVENTS EL MOMENTO VENTILATION SO. I'M AND THEN AGAIN IF THEY ARE LOANS SO THAT WE HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO RECRUIT THOSE DOLLARS IF THEY ARE NOT APPROPRIATELY EXPENDED. AND WHEN YOU SEE APPROPRIATELY EXPENDED THE MAIN I'VE SUGGESTED THAT THEY STAY IN BUSINESS FOR THREE YEARS. SO THAT THEY THEY HAVE SOME. ACCRUED TO- THE KICKED THE COMMUNITY AND THEN GIVING THEM THIS FORGIVABLE LOAN TO STAY IN BUSINESS WILL BE BUILT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE DO YOU HAVE HAVE YOU TALKED IT. ACTUAL INVESTORS OR INVESTORS THAT WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT MODEL OR DIFFERENT. NO THAT'S VERY CONSISTENT SENATOR WENT WELL WHAT THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT ALSO- YOU KNOW I WOULD ADD TO THAT- APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AS THOSE FACILITIES WOULD NEED TO BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE OPERATING CONSISTENT WITH OFF OKAY LAST QUESTION FOR ME- AT THE END OF A- PAGE SEVENTEEN OF OUR STAFF REPORT. WE TALK ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS OF THE BOTTLE BILL AND CAL RECYCLE PUBLISHED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN- THE PUBLICATION OF THE PROGRAM IT'S LIMITED ABILITIES XCERRA WE TALKED ABOUT. IMPROVING RECYCLING AND MANUFACTURING SHARING RESPONSIBILITIES THAT'S A GOOD AND INTERESTING THOUGHT AND ENHANCING ADAPT ADAPTABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY IN BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TODAY WE HAD. REPLANTED CLOSING ITS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR. LOCATIONS HOW DOES THIS PROPOSAL RESPOND TO THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CAL. RECYCLED PUBLICATION. WELL I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT HAD THAT THE LEGISLATURE WHERE THE LEGISLATURE HAS INCORPORATED SOME OF THE CONCEPTS TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN- WHITE PAPER THAT THE DEPARTMENT PUT OUT AT THAT JUNCTURE. I HAVEN'T SITTING HERE SOMEPLACE WHAT PAPER AND SO I WOULD SAY FIRST AND FOREMOST I THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHITE PAPER RECOMMENDED- DOING SOME PILOT PROJECTS TO TEST SOME MORE FLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS SO AS YOU AND AS WE DISCUSSED AND AS YOU ALL WELL KNOW WE ARE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW IS A STATE AND ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS- OVERALL SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN THE SYSTEM AND I THINK YOU WILL ALSO KNOW IN THE IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHITE PAPER THERE ARE SOME STATUTORY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT AT THAT- THAT TO BE AT WHAT YOU WERE MADE AS IN ADDITION TO. THE WERE THAT WE IN TWENTY TWENTY AB PURSUANT TO AB AT FIFTY FOUR AND I THINK THE OVERALL THEME OF THOSE VIEWS THE WHITE PAPER AND THE AB FIFTY FOUR REPORT IS THAT THERE ARE SOME- CHANGES THAT SHOULD BE MADE TO THIS PROGRAM TO PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY I TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE AS THE NEEDS ARE DEMANDED BY THE PEOPLE IN THOSE PARTS OF THE STATE AND I THINK THIS PROPOSAL REALLY GOES TO THAT FIGHT AGAINST MOBILE RECYCLING IN PARTS OF THE STATE DEPLOYING MOBILE RECYCLING IN PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE I HAVE RECYCLING CENTER. PERHAPS AT AND ISN'T GOING TO BE PROFITABLE OVER THE LONG TERM DEPLOYING RPM'S CHIP GROCERS WHO WANT TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION BUT DON'T HAVE THE REAL ESTATE OUR RECYCLING THAT- RECYCLER LARGE BINS AND A LOT IN THEIR PARKING LOT WHAT ARE SOME OTHER THINGS WHERE WE CAN BE MORE FLEXIBLE FOR THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF. THE STATE OF THAT ARE THAT ARE- HAVING TOWN AND DO WE INSTILL THAT FLEX OF. INTO INTO OUR SYSTEM TO INCREASE OVERALL RECYCLE BUT NO OF FOR TAKE ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM. RIGHT- I GUESS I'LL JUST NOTE THAT THE SHARED RESPONSIBILITIES WHICH IS A KEY COMPONENT OF THE REPORT JUST SEEMS TO- NOT GET ADDRESS ONE LAST QUESTION- THE THERE'S NO PROPOSALS THAT ADDRESS HANDLING FEES IS SIR. A REASON THAT SEEMS TO BE A CONTINUING- CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE OR A CONCERT A CONCERNED A COMPLAINT TENANT OR ONE OF THE PRIMARY TENANTS OF THIS PROPOSAL FOR IS THAT A RECOGNITION THAT THIS IS LIKELY ONE TIME FUNDING ALLEN BY USING THESE DOLLARS TO REFORM THE HANDLING FEES- THAT WOULD PROVIDE A FROM. CREATE A NEW EXPECTATION THAT CAN ONLY BE USED WITH AND STATE TEAMS PERMANENTLY OUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING HERE TO DO IS REALLY AGAINST PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM- TESTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND NEW THEORIES IN PARTS OF THE STATE AND HISTORICALLY BEEN. UNDERSERVED OR DIFFICULT TO SERVE AND PROVIDE EVERYTHING ALL CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM TOMORROW- AND WE REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH YOU SENATOR ON HOW CAN WE USE THESE DOLLARS- TO BEST CREATE LONG TERM INJURY- HIS SOLUTIONS- AND- I THINK AT WHAT WE PUT FORWARD IS EIGHTY- A VERY. STRONG PROPOSAL TO DO SO. MISTER BROWN THE DAILY- YOU'VE LISTENED TO THIS. CALL OUR DISCUSSION FOR AN HOUR PLUS YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. I THINK THE MAIN- IT UP SOME OF THE MAIN A KIND OF IMPORTANT ISSUES I THINK WE'VE HEARD IS THAT I MEAN ONE- THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY AND IT IS ONE TIME MONEY AND SO- AND THERE'S ALSO SORT OF I THINK IN MANY CASES JUST. LIMITED INFORMATION ABOUT KIND OF WHAT THE ACTUAL OUTCOMES ARE GOING TO BE- AND IN MANY CASES IT'S SORT OF EXPANDING ON. HIGHLIGHTS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE BUT MAYBE WE JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION OR DETAIL LONG KIND OF LESSONS LEARNED FROM THOSE AND WHAT WORKS AND WHAT THE OUTCOMES OF THEM AND SO. I THINK WE WERE JUST SORT OF- SUGGESTED THE LEGISLATURE- THINK ABOUT KIND OF KIND OF ALLOCATE TO THESE NEW ACTIVITIES WITH THAT LIMITED AMOUNT OF INFORMATION- WITH AN EYE TOWARDS ANOTHER COMMENT SURROUNDS YOUR REPORTING AND TRYING TO GET GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT. WHAT THOSE OUTCOMES. ACTUALLY WILL BE IF THEY GET FUNDED AND SO MAKING SURE THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS THAT. TYPE OF OVERSIGHT REPORTING. WHATEVER ACTIONS IT TAKES SO THEY CAN HAVE BEEN INFORMATION ABOUT ITS DECISIONS GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER. MISS WAGNER ARE DIRECTOR WAGNER DEPUTY. DIRECTOR OF MCINTYRE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME WE WILL NOW MOVE- TO ANYONE HERE IN ROOM. ONE TWO ZERO ZERO WHO WOULD LIKE TO SHARE PART OF PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE COME FORWARD. AS A REMINDER TO THESE PARTICIPATION NUMBER FOR THOSE- PROVIDING COMMENT- TELEPHONICALLY WOULD BE EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE SIX THREE SIX FOUR. AND THE ACCESS CODE IS. OF. ONE FOUR ONE ONE ONE FOUR ZERO AND DO THE CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LINK LINK THE FAIRINGS TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND CLEANING INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY TODAY. I'M GOING TO LISTEN TO THE. THE ASSEMBLAGE- IS PROCEED. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHASE AND I WITH THAT'LL STING ROPES AND SMITH ON BASS OF THE GLOW PACKAGING AND JUST WANTED TO OFFER HANG ON WE GOT IT WE'RE NOT- NOT PICKING UP THE SOUND. IF YOU COULD START OVER YEAH NO PROBLEM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I COMING THROUGH NOW. NO. OKAY HOW BOUT NOW. HEY TONY HERE YOU. OKAY OVER HERE WITHOUT BOXES YEAH. COME BEHIND THE BAR. REGULAR MAKING EXTRA EXCEPTION HERE- SO IS THIS ONE S. TEST TEST MAYBE I JUST NEED TO GET CLOSER TO THE MIKE THE WHOLE TIME BUT I'M GLAD TO BE BACK HERE WITH ALL OF YOU KNOW THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO AGAIN J. SNACKING ON BEHALF OF THE GLASS PACKAGING INSTITUTE JUST WANTED TO OFFER A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON THE DISCUSSION THAT YOU ALL JUST HAD AND REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE WHILE WE WELCOME INVESTMENTS IN THE PROGRAM. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THE DETAILS AS WE ALL DISCUSS REALLY DO MATTER- AND AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION G. P. I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALLOCATE FUNDING TO SUPPORT BY BACK INFRASTRUCTURE BUT AT A HIGH LEVEL A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ON THE ON THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT ARE INCLUDED HERE FIRST GPI IS OPPOSED TO THE PROPOSED INCREASE IN REDEMPTION PAYMENTS IS SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT THAT THEY'RE BETTER INVESTMENTS FOR THAT MONEY THAT THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO PUT IT TO GOOD USE. I'M ON THE ISSUE OF FUNDING FOR REVERSE VENDING MACHINES IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE THOSE MACHINES BE SUPPORTED BY IT BY A RECYCLER IF NOT YOU'RE COLLECTING MATERIAL THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY COME BACK AND OR RATHER IT'LL SIT THERE. ON MOBILE RECITE. YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY PROMISING THING. BUT WE ARE WAITING TO SEE YOU YOU KNOW THE ALTERNATE OUTCOMES OF THE EXISTING PILOTS. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IN SOME JURISDICTIONS- YOU KNOW BAG DROPS MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT TO MAKE. AND LASTLY AND VERY IMPORTANTLY FOR THE FOR THE GLASS PACKAGING INSTITUTE WE REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH CAL RECYCLE IN THE LEGISLATURE ON ON QUALITY INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE Q. I. P. NOT SUBSIDIZE BUSINESS WOULD USE AS USUAL WE NEED TO HAVE HIGH QUALITY. GLASS ARE RECYCLABLE GLASS THAT COMES OUT OF THAT PAYMENT- AND SO AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE READY TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND WORK ON THAT WITH YOU BUT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER THESE COMMENTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE EX. A GOOD MORNING KYLE JONES WITH COMMUNITY WATER CENTER AND I WANTED TO SPEAK ON ISSUE SIX ON THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION PROPOSAL FOR- THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT AND WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW NOT PROVIDING THAT EXEMPTION COULD IMPACT THE WORKLOAD OVER THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WE SUPPORT THE NEW POSITIONS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED TO IMPLEMENT SIGMA- BUT WE'RE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE- THERE'S THIRTY FOUR PLANS THAT ARE CURRENTLY. CONSIDERED INCOMPLETE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES OVER TWELVE BASINS THAT COULD BE DEEMED TO PROBATIONARY AND THAT REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD- THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF SIGMUND NOW REQUIRES THAT ONCE THE BOARD DEEMS AT BASE AND PROBATIONARY THERE IS THEY DO HAVE TO WAIT AN ENTIRE YEAR BEFORE THEY CAN START DEVELOPING THE INTERIM PLAN TO MOVE THE BASIN TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY AND SO WITH THE EXISTING DELAYS BUILT INTO THE STATURE WERE CONCERNED THAT THESE PLANTS WON'T BE READY UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND FOR COMMUNITIES ON THE GROUND THIS COULD MEAN DELAY IN GETTING RELIEF AND MOVEMENT TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY THE APRIL FINANCE LETTER NOTED THAT EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED MILES COULD GO TRY THIS YEAR ALONE AND IF WEARING CONTINUE DROUGHT THAT NUMBER'S ONLY GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET WORSE OVER TIME- SO WE JUST ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HOW THIS ACTION- TO REJECT THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION TODAY COULD NOT FURTHER DELAY THAT TIME FRAME AND- ADD MORE WORKLOAD TO THE TO THE BOARD'S PROCESS. AND YOU'RE MINDFUL OF THE SIX MILLION THAT WILL BE ALLOCATED TO COMPLETE THAT THE SEQUEL AND THE AT LEAST PRESENTATION OF A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF CHALLENGES THAT THAT THIS AREA HAS HAD OKAY YEAH YEAH I THINK THAT THAT THE FUNDING IS HELPFUL- BUT IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME AND AGAIN GIVEN THAT THERE IS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT THAT THEY WAIT A YEAR TO START ON GETTING THAT PLAN READY- WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THAT THAT ADDS POTENTIAL DELAY THERE BUT OUR APPRECIATIVE OF THE RESOURCE AT LEAST. THANK YOU THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS AND THREE MILLION ON BEHALF OF THE PLASTIC RECYCLING CORPORATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION. I WOULD WANT TO START BY THANKING THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION- FOR PROACTIVELY ENGAGING IN PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK FOR THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. AS WELL AS YOU GUYS IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS TODAY- HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED. A SPECIFICALLY AROUND- THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR TAKE BACK CREDIT. THIS LIMITED TIME. WE BELIEVE THIS PROPOSAL IS HAS SOME FLAWS. I'M A WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME DIFFERENT IMPROVEMENTS OUT WITH THE FUNDING IN THAT SPECIFIC SPACE. I SPECIFICALLY ARE GOING TOWARD SOME OF YOUR DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT RURAL AREAS- INVESTING IN KEY AREAS. FOR NEW CERTIFIED RECYCLING CENTERS CERTIFIED PROCESSORS AND ADDITIONAL METHODS OF COLLECTION WE THINK THOSE FUNDS COULD BE USED BETTER AND- ARE MORE WELL SPENT AND THAT WAY. WE KNOW THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS WILL ALSO INCREASE THE STATE RECYCLING RATE WHICH IS ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM. AND ALSO- PROVIDE CLEAN MATERIAL- TO HELP WITH THE STATE'S MANDATED RECYCLE CONTENT- IT FINALLY ALSO ALONG WITH THIS PROPOSAL WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME POLICY CONSIDERATIONS THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED- TO HELP WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THIS BCP- THAT IS FLEXIBLE STAFFING HOURS HOURS OF OPERATION. ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS TO CONSUMERS ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND THEN CONSISTENT COLLECTION METHODS OF MATERIALS WHEN USING THE AUTOMATED RECYCLING MACHINES WE THANK YOU GUYS SO WE CAN. PLAN TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND THE ADMINISTRATION I JUST MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU. HELLO GOOD MORNING- TERRA CAL SKIN MEMBERS- STEVEN MYERS ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL CONSERVATION COURSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- THE THEIR CORE MEMBERS ACTUALLY IT FROM ACROSS THE STATE HERE IN SACRAMENTO TODAY FOR THE GOVERNMENT EDUCATION DAY. AND WE WOULD LOVE FOR LEGISLATIVE OFFICES TO STOP BY THE WEST LAWN TO SEE DEMONSTRATION OF THE WORK THE COURTS ARE DOING- INCLUDING YOUR CYCLING WORK- THE CORES ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BCP. FROM CAL RECYCLE PARTICULARLY THOSE PIECES THAT ALLOW THE COURT TO BUILD ON THEIR EXISTING EXPERIENCE- IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THE PILOT PROGRAMS. SO WE APPRECIATE DIRECTOR WAGNER'S CALL OUT FOR PRIORITIZING CALLS- COURSE FOR THOSE MOBILE RECYCLING PROGRAMS THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING FUNDED- THERE'S AN OVERLAP BETWEEN SOME OF THE POLICY SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED LEGISLATIVELY THE COURTS ARE IN SUPPORT OF AND THIS B. C. P. SO WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION WORKING TOGETHER TO IMPROVE WHAT WE ALL KNOW IS A SYSTEM THAT'S IN NEED OF. SOME SOME IMPROVEMENTS AND SOME UPDATES- WE WOULD SUGGEST TO FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS- THAT AREN'T SPELLED OUT EXPLICITLY IN THE B. C. P. SO FIRST THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AS WE ALL KNOW IN THE MOBILE OF BUY BACK CENTRES AND THEN INSTALLATION OF AUTOMATIC RECYCLING MACHINES WHICH- DIRECTOR WAGNER ALSO REFERRED TO AS REVERSE VENDING MACHINES. AND LOCAL COURTS ARE CALLED OUT IN THE B. C. P. BUT THE QUESTION IS WHETHER LOCAL COURTS WILL BE ABLE TO HELP STAFF THOSE ACTIVITIES IN PARTICULAR. WE THINK THAT THERE WILL NEED TO BE SOME LOCAL CORE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THOSE MOBILE PROGRAMS THE A. R. M.'S AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT MIGHT BE DEPLOYED- AND SECOND THERE WILL LIKELY BE SOME TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE BUDGET IS ENACTED IN ONE. MOBILE PROGRAMS ARE UP AND RUNNING. WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO INCREASE IN FUNDING TO LOCAL COURSE IN THE INTERIM TO. INCREASE THEIR BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAMS WILL THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS ARE ARE BEING FOR THOSE MOBILE PROGRAMS ARE. BEING DEPLOYED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN TODAY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION. SPECIFICALLY TO TALK ABOUT THE CAL RECYCLE- BCP WE DO WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR. FOR COMING FORWARD WITH A PROPOSAL TO. START TO LOOK AT HOW WE BETTER USE- THE AMOUNT THAT IN RESERVE. SIX HUNDRED MILLION IS A LOT OF MONEY. HIGHNESS MONEY THAT SHOULD BE USED TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM AND IMPROVE PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO ACTUALLY RECYCLE. HOW WE'RE NOT IN FAVOR OF THE HUNDRED MILLION TO DOUBLE- THE CRV- IN MANY OF THOSE AREAS THAT ARE UNSERVED- THOSE ARE NOW BEING SERVED BY GROCERY STORES. AND MANY AREAS IN THE RURAL AREAS OR SMALL GROCERY STORES. SIMPLY CAN'T HANDLE HOW WHAT THEY'RE EXPECTED TO DO NOW- AND WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT INCREASED. POTENTIAL VOLUME- THAT WOULD COME FROM THAT SHORT TERM BENEFIT WE DO BELIEVE THAT MONEY SHOULD BE. INVESTED IN IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE- AND WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT FLEXIBILITY IN THE CONVERSATION TODAY. YET THE BCP IS REALLY SILO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CERTAIN MONIES FOR RBM FOR DROWNED OUT CERTAIN MONIES FOR MOBILE WE THINK THOSE DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE ON A LOCAL LEVEL. HOW TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE BEST OPPORTUNITY. FOR CONVENIENCE TO HAPPEN IN THOSE AREAS. WE ALSO HAD NO DISCUSSION ABOUT CONVENIENCE- WE'RE STILL WORKING OFF OF A HALF A MILE RADIUS CIRCLE AROUND A GROCERY STORE. THAT WAS WRITTEN THIRTY YEARS AGO. OF THE 40% OR SO OF UNSERVED ZONES WE'VE ONLY SEEN A REDUCTION IN- RECYCLING BY EIGHT TO TEN PERCENT. THOSE UNSERVED ZONES WERE BEING OPERATED BY LOW PERFORMING. RECYCLERS HOW CAN WE ASSIST LOPER. RECYCLERS TO STAY IN BUSINESS SO THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THAT CLEAN RECYCLABLE MATERIAL. BACK THAT NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION. THE DISCUSSION DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED SOON AROUND. RPM'S AT GROCERY STORES IF AN RVM WORKS IS THERE A BETTER LOCATION THAT PROVIDES BETTER CONVENIENCE FOR COMMUNITY. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT AT HAPPENS AND THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF INCREASING OUR RECYCLING RATE SO WE LIKE THE IDEA OF SPENDING THAT RESERVE DOWN THAT MONEY NEEDS TO GET BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. TO CREATE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR RECYCLING WE THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE CAN BETTER MOVE THAT MONEY FORWARD. TO ACTUALLY OBTAIN THOSE GOALS HAVE INCREASING THE RECYCLING RATE THANK YOU. GREG HER ON BEHALF OF THE CAN MANUFACTURERS INSTITUTE FIRST TO. MISS CHARITY LIKE TECHNOLOGY ARE CORRECT THERE WERE TIMES DURING THE COVE IT EMERGENCY THAT MATERIALS WERE GOING DIRECTLY TO LANDFILLS- CAN MANUFACTURERS INSTITUTE ACTUALLY REACHED OUT SOME WASTE HAULERS THAT WE'RE HAVING TO DO THAT- TO SEE WHAT WE COULD DO TO PARTICIPATE IN TRYING TO GET THAT. MATERIAL BACK ONLINE- TEMPORARILY STORED SO THAT CAN BE PROCESSED AT A LATER TIME AND THERE WERE- PUBLIC ARTICLES ABOUT THAT AT THE TIME SO I DON'T KNOW. WHO IS SEEM TO BE REGIONAL THOUGH SO I'M NOT SURE IT'S GOING TO SHOW UP IN ALL THE WAYS CHARACTERIZATION STUDIES AS A DIRECTOR WAS TALKING ABOUT. BUT IT BUT IT DID OCCUR- CAN FACTORIES INSTITUTE WOULDN'T PRETTY MUCH LIKE TO ALIGN WITH- THE COMMENTS AT THE- FROM THE L. A. O. AND- MY PREVIOUS COLLEAGUES AND- MANY OF YOU ON THE COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE FORTY TWO PERCENT. OF ZONES UNSERVED- IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO BE DOUBLING. THE DOING THE CONSUMER CREDIT IDEA I MEAN YOU HAVE. TO RULE MEMBERS UP HERE BETTER. THAT THEIR- RESIDENTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE TAKE BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT SO WE HAVE TO GET THE INVESTMENT BACK INTO- GETTING. RECYCLING CENTERS UP AND RUNNING. THERE'S AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT STATUTORY ISSUES IT WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR ACTUALLY ON BEHALF OF GROCERY STORES THAT WOULD BRING RPM'S. YOU KNOW MAKE IT MORE CONVENIENT FOR THEM- IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD TO BRING RPM'S OUT IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN THERE THAT MAKE IT REALLY DIFFICULT FOR GROCERS ACTUALLY AGREED TO EVEN PUT THEM UP IN PLACE.

PACKAGING SOLUTION IT IS SUPPORTIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITMENT TO INVESTING IN THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IN RECENT YEARS THE STATE HAS LOST MORE THAN 50% OF ITS RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE- MUCH OF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE WITH A TAKE BACK MECHANISMS MOST CONVENIENT FOR CONSUMERS THOUGH WITH CONTAINERS. WERE SUCCESSFULLY THWARTED AND BREAKEVEN CONTAMINATION CLASS IN PARTICULAR WITH THE BOY AT THE WE SUPPORT BUDGET INVESTMENT IN THE EXPANSION OF CLEAN COLLECTION PROCESSES THIS INCLUDES PROPERTIES THAT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CONSUMER CAN BE A TAKE BACK BETTER- THAT INCREASE SUPPLY AND REDUCE BREAKING CONTAMINATION. ALSO EFFORT TO INCENTIVIZE ARE COMPELLED MORE RESPONSIBLE SORTING THAT RESULT IN A CLEANER FEEDSTOCK AND LASTLY EFFORTS TO SUPPORT OR COMPENSATE FOR THE HIGH COST OF BLACK REMANUFACTURING OUR HOPE REALLY IS THAT INVESTMENTS LIKE THOSE- THAT I MENTIONED WILL INCREASE THE RECYCLE BACK TO QUIET YOU KNOW IN A WAY THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS.

WERE REALLY PLEASED TO THE STATE ROPOSING TO SPEND UNREDEEMED TO ACCESS TO CONSUMER AND OPPORTUNITIES- TO THANK YOU POWER CYCLE AND THANK YOU SENATOR FOR CONSIDERING THIS WELL WE THINK SOME OF THE PROPOSALS ARE REASONABLE WE AGREE THAT MORE DETAILS ARE NEEDED AND THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES SHOULD BE EXPLORED. WE'RE SUPPORTING THE MOBILE AND FIXED RECYCLING PROGRAMS IN RURAL AND UNDERSERVED AREAS QUALITY ON TIME PAYMENTS AND FORGIVABLE LOANS WE THINK THOSE ALL MAKES SENSE WORKS BY THE POTENTIAL POTENTIAL TO DEPLOY REVERSE VENDING MACHINES BUT WE BELIEVE THE POINT IS MACHINES AT HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES WILL REALLY MISS THE MARK AND COULD INHIBIT USE OF THOSE FACILITIES. BY MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC- MY BACK THE ENVELOPE CALCULATIONS IS FOR MOST HIGH SCHOOL THAT WOULD EQUAL AN INVESTMENT OF ABOUT FIVE DOLLARS PER KID AT THE HIGH SCHOOL WHEN THERE AREN'T ADEQUATE REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES ANOTHER IS THAT THE STATE. WE ALSO HAVE STRONG MISGIVINGS ABOUT DOUBLING THE REFUND PAID TO CONSUMERS BECAUSE IT ONLY LASTS A VERY I'M IN COULD BE EXACT BY THE TIME WE GET REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES OUT TO THOSE WHO DON'T HAPPEN TODAY SO WE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF MERIT AND AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS ON THIS- AND ARE ENCOURAGED WITH WHERE THIS IS GOING THANK YOU.
