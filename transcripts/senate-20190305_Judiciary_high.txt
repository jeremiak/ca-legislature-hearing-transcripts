EXPLORING THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT AND ITS EUROPEAN COUNTERPART. KNOWN AS GDP ARE AND I SHOULD REMEMBER WHAT THAT STANDS FOR BUT AT THE MOMENT IT IS ESCAPING ME IT IS THE EUROPEAN COUNTERPART TO OUR THE CC PA WHICH SET THE WAY TO START ADDRESSING THE WHOLE ISSUE OF DATA PRIVACY. AND HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IT IS HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- AS WELL AS I THINK THE NATION AS THEY LOOK TO CALIFORNIA WE ARE. OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE STATE THAT SHOWS WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND HOPEFULLY IN THIS ONE WE'RE SEVERAL OTHER STATES ACTUALLY THAT HAVE. IN FACT TAKEN THE MODEL AND ARE USING IT AS A TEMPLATE. FOR THEIR EFFORTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM -- THERE ARE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF OUR COMMITTEE WHO ARE HOPING TO ATTEND WE DO HAVE. OUR VICE CHAIR WITH US TODAY AND A SENATOR MONEY JUST WALKED IN THERE SHOULD BE MORE PEOPLE COMING -- WE HAVE A ROBUST FOR ANY OUR INTEREST [inaudible] I WANT A QUICK -- BUT AN IMPORTANT TO READ CAUGHT. DONE. DEALING WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF OUR DATA PRIVACY PROTECTION A WONDERFUL COMPARISON. OF BETWEEN THE CCPA AND THE G. D. P. R. THAT'S AVAILABLE HERE. IN ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WEBSITE AND I COMMENDED TO YOU IT'S NOT BAD TIME READING PER SE BUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT READING THAT WILL GIVE YOU I THINK SOME VERY VERY HELPFUL BACKGROUND. AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAWS THAT EXISTS IN SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE WILL BE. DISCUSSING AT SOME LENGTH HERE THIS AFTERNOON. WELL YOU KNOW I WAS I WAS THINKING WHO WAS HIT IN THE CONGRESS WHO WAS THE TAX SPECIALIST THE OF GOD HIMSELF LITTLE TROUBLE JUMPING INTO ONE OF THE PAWNS IN WASHINGTON SEE MILLS. WAS IN NAME WHO CLAIMED THAT HE READ THE TAX CODE IN THE EVENING BEFORE BED TIME AND THAT ALWAYS MADE ME WONDER JUST HOW MUCH FOR IT HE COULD READ. OF WHEN -- SOME OF IT IS KIND OF COMPLICATED AS THIS ISSUE IS BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND ONE THAT HOPEFULLY. WE WILL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOUGHTFULLY SO WITH THAT I'M A GRATEFUL TO ALL WHO ARE HERE TODAY AND THIS IS ALSO. BEING PRESENTED ON LINE IS I MENTION IT'S AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND IT'S ONE THAT I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL TO US IN THE FUTURE IS AMANDA HERE BY THE WAY. OUR ONE INTRODUCE AMANDA MATCHING SHE'S JUST RECENTLY JOINED OUR COMMITTEE -- AS COUNSEL WELCOME AMANDA WE LOOK FORWARD TO SOME. OF VERY INTERESTING CHALLENGES GOING FORWARD THIS YEAR. AND OF WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS JUST MAKE A FEW OPENING REMARKS AND ASK OTHERS IF THEY'D LIKE TO MAKE SOME AS WELL AND THEN GET STARTED. WE WILL HAVE A AS I MENTIONED SOME ROBUST DISCUSSIONS AND THEN WE WILL AT THE END OFFER A PUBLIC COMMENT TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE WITH YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. OF BEING PROVIDED AT THE FRONT END OF YOUR REMARKS SO WITH THAT -- I WANT TO THANK THANK THE STAFF AGAIN FOR AN EXCELLENT -- SERIES OF DOCUMENTS THAT WILL BE HELPFUL IN PUTTING TOGETHER WHAT I THINK IS A VERY. THOROUGH AN EXCITING PANEL -- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND NOT A NEW ISSUE FOR MANY OF US PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION OF ALWAYS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT TO ME -- I THINK IT'S AFTER I READ THE BOOK. BRAVE NEW WORLD AND THE IMAGE OF A BIG TV SCREEN ON THE WALL IF ANY OF YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK -- IF THERE IS BIG BROTHER WHO IS WATCHING YOU. RATHER THAN YOU WATCHING THE TV AND IN MANY RESPECTS THE THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF DATA PRIVACY REALLY DOES HAVE. AS PART OF ITS CONSEQUENCE WHO IS WATCHING US AND WHAT IS THE INFORMATION THEY'RE COLLECTING NOW IT MAY NOT BE THE GOVERNMENT OR IT MAY. BUT CERTAINLY WE DO KNOW THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR THROUGH THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT EXIST TODAY. HAVE REALLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF INTO OUR HOMES INTO OUR LIVES -- AND OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT MANY OF US DON'T EVEN KNOW IS BEING TAKEN. AND USING IT OR SELLING IT OR DOING THINGS WITH IT THAT WE'RE NOT AWARE OFF AND SO PART OF I THINK THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN THE PUBLIC DOESN'T REALLY KNOW. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO ON TO THE INTERNET OR -- YOU BY A CERTAIN PRODUCT -- OR SOMETHING THAT IS IDENTIFIABLE TO YOU OR PRODUCT THE PEOPLE MIGHT AT SOME POINT WANT TO SELL YOU OR INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES THAT THEY MIGHT WANNA USED TO THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE I THINK OF CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA AS AN EXAMPLE WHERE WE'VE LEARNED THAT. IN FACT OUR OF ELECTION DECISIONS FOR AMONG THE MOST PERSONAL DECISIONS WE MAKE WE'RE BEING MANIPULATED AS A RESULT OF INFORMATION BEING OBTAINED WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE. OR PERMISSION OR CONSENT. SO CALIFORNIA UNLIKE MANY OTHER PLACES IN CERTAINLY UNLIKE OUR FEDERAL CONSTITUTION WE HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY. THAT IS BUILT RIGHT INTO OUR CONSTITUTION AND IT HAPPENED IRONICALLY WE DID A LITTLE RESEARCH ON THIS ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO. THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE THEN MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO AND THE VICTIM OF AN ASSASSINATION WAS THE MAYOR GEORGE MOSCONI. AND BACK FORTY YEARS AGO HE REALIZED THAT THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WERE BEING DEVELOPED MIGHT VERY WELL IMPACT OUR PERSONAL PRIVACY AND AS A RESULT -- WAS THE MOVING FORCE. ON A BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT PASSED DO WE KNOW THE NUMBERS HOW OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED. WELL REGARDLESS IT PASSED THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA PASSED AN INITIATIVE THAT PUT PRIVACY AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. THAT EXIST RIGHT WITHIN OUR STATE'S CONSTITUTION. BUT DESPITE ITS STATUS AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT FACT BEEN UNDER ATTACK AND AS I MENTIONED THE AND CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA SCANDAL AMONG OTHERS PROVE THAT. WE HAVE LOST A LOT OF OUR PRIVACY AND WANT TO TAKE IT BACK AND LAST YEAR WE TOOK OUR FIRST STEPS WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT AS A RESULT OF THE COMMITMENT. DETERMINATION AND POCKETBOOK OF ONE ALISTAIR MCTAGGART WHO WILL BE OUR FIRST WITNESS TODAY WHO ALSO I THINK SHARE THAT CONCERNED ABOUT THE THREATS TO OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AS A RESULT OF THIS LACK OF OF THIS LOSS OF OUR PRIVACY. BUT THE CCPA. WAS A GOOD FIRST STEP. LIKELY A WITH MORE NEEDING TO BE DONE TO BOLSTER ITS PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS AND THEIR PRIVACY AND THERE ARE MANY OF US I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE FORTY BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED THIS YEAR. ADDRESSING THE C. CPA AND OTHER PRIVACY RIGHTS SO I THINK THERE ARE OTHERS WHO SHARE. MY CONCERN THAT WE NEED TO PERHAPS DO MORE WORK BEFORE. WE PUT THIS -- OF THE BILL BEFORE THE PUBLIC. IN THE CA IN SO FAR AS IMPLEMENT TATIAN PERIOD OF TWENTY TWENTY SO THERE'S WORK WE CAN DO BETWEEN NOW AND THEN -- AND BASICALLY -- OUR PRIVACY RIGHTS CANNOT BE UNDERMINED IN THE NAME OF CORPORATE PROFIT I THINK THAT IS A CLEAR VALUE THAT MOST OF US HAVE AND CERTAINLY ONE THAT -- TO WE'RE HOPING TO ADVANCE. IN THE YEARS TO COME OFF THE GREAT WORK THAT WAS DONE LAST YEAR AND THANKS TO MR MCTAGGART SO -- THERE ARE WE KNOW NUMEROUS GROUPS THAT ARE EYEING THIS EFFORT -- IT WITH AN INTEREST IN DILUTING ITS IMPACT I THINK MANY OF US HERE. BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE BUT WE WANT TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S WORKABLE FOR OUR BUSINESSES SO PART OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY IS GOING TO BE -- FINDING OUT FROM PRACTITIONERS -- EXACTLY HOW THIS BILL CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AND HOW THE GDP ARE WHICH WAS. PERHAPS A MORE ROBUST A EUROPEAN MODEL I IS ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED SO THE NOTION WE CAN'T DO THIS BECAUSE IT'LL BLOW UP THE THE BUSINESS MODEL I THINK IS A SORT OF A FALSE NARRATIVE AND ONE THAT I'M HOPING WE WILL. THE BUNK FAIRLY QUICKLY WE REALLY AND WITH THAT -- I WILL INVITE OTHERS -- TO MAKE OPENING REMARKS IF THEY HAVE A FEW THOUGHTS I'D LIKE TO SHARE. MISTER VICE CHAIR YOU'RE ALL SET TO GO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WASN'T PLANNING ON IT HAVING AN OPENING REMARK BUT I WILL SAY -- THAT. DISAPPEARS AT FIRST BLUSH TO BE A TERRIBLY COMPLICATED -- THE LAW -- ONE THEN I AM EXPOSING MYSELF TO IN TRYING TO LEARN AS MUCH ABOUT -- I HAD A COMMUNITY MEETING IN MY FORMER CAPACITY IS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR. WHERE WE HAD -- IT WAS ORIENTED TOWARDS SENIORS HOW TO AVOID SENIOR SCAMS. AND THAT KIND OF BROUGHT TO THE FORE -- HOW INFORMATION CAN BE? PUT OUT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN IN BY THOSE -- ULTERIOR MOTIVES CAN BE USED TO HASSLE IN MISLEAD. VULNERABLE PORTIONS OF OUR COMMUNITY IN THIS CASE SENIORS. AND THAT KIND OF GOT ME THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS OUT THERE. I'D LIKE TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE IS IN IMPLEMENTATION THAT IS BALANCED AS YOU MENTION MADAM CHAIR -- THAT IS -- THAT IS LOOKING AFTER ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHTS OF BASED ON PERSONAL INFORMATION WHILE ALSO MAKING CERTAIN THAT -- WE DO NOT. SO SILO OUR ECONOMY INFORMATION ECONOMY -- THAT HURTS IS COMPETITIVELY SO I THINK LIKE ANYTHING ELSE IS THE BALANCE I AND I THINK THAT APPROACH IS ALWAYS A HEALTHY -- ONE BUT I WOULD -- WHEN I FIRST CAME TO GO AND I HAD A WIKIPEDIA PAGE? AND MUCH TO MY CHAGRIN MY BIRTHDAY WAS ON THERE I THOUGHT AT SOME POINT TIME THERE WERE CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT WAS SACROSANCT -- SO SECURITY NUMBERS BIRTH DATES TRULY. HALLMARK IDENTIFYING PIECE OF INFORMATION -- AND APPARENTLY IT WAS OUT THERE AND I HAD TO GO THROUGH THE LABORIOUS PROCESS OF GETTING IT REMOVED. IT CAN BE DONE BUT THE ONUS CERTAINLY WAS ON ME SO IT WAS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THE CCPA PLAYS ITSELF OUT IN OUR ROLE IN THIS PROCESS. ANY OTHERCOMMENTS THE OPENING REMARKS SENATOR ALLEN. JUST BECAUSE YOU GOT TO REMOVE HIS NAME WHEN I WAS CAN'T FIND IT WITHIN A MINUTE. BECAUSE OF THIS BECAUSE YOU GOT TO REMOVE DOESN'T MEAN WHEN ONE OF US CAN'T FIND IT WITHIN A MINUTE OR TWO BECAUSE ONCE IT'S UP IT'S ALWAYS UP. THANK YOU SENATOR MONEY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M SORRY MISS SOME OF THE OPENING COMMENTS OF OTHERS. I JUST WANT TO AGAIN THANK YOUR STAFF FOR WHAT I THINK WAS REALLY HELPFUL. BRIEFING -- BACKGROUND -- I FOUND IT VERY USEFUL I WANT TO THANK MR MCTAGGART NOW THE WITNESSES WHO ARE HERE TODAY AND FOR BACK TO THE CHAIR THANK YOU. THEY'RE A CASCADE IN INCOME ANSWERED WITH A ROCK AND ROLL. I DO WANT TO TELL YOU JUST A BIT OF IRONY MY MY HUSBAND WHO IS A RETIRED JUDGE IS LISTENING FROM HOME AND SENT ME A TEXT THAT SAID THE NAME I WAS THINKING OF WAS WILBUR MILLS. SO TECHNOLOGY DOES HAVE A CONGRESSMAN WILBUR MILLS -- PRODUCT LINE BY BY THAT. AND THAT MAY BE SOMEWHAT PROBLEMATIC. ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD THANK YOU -- AGAIN. MR MAKE THAGARD REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR EFFORT THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS AND THE FLOOR IS OURS TO GIVE US AN OVERVIEW. OF ON THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. GREAT WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH A MEASURE VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY -- I REALLY AM GRATEFUL FOR THIS FOR THIS TIME IT'S A PRIVILEGE AND AN HONOR TO BE HERE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT WHEN WE DO TODAY IS JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HISTORY -- BRIEFLY AND THEN ADDRESS SOME OF THE MORE COMMONLY. BERKELEY MYTHS ABOUT IT -- AND ADDRESS. BUT I'VE COME TO LEARN IT'S CALLED FLOOD THE FEAR UNCERTAINTY AND DOUBT THAT IS BEING. THROWN AROUND THIS -- AROUND THIS ACT AND THEN TEXT OF A CPA. THE JUSTICE A GOOD REMINDER FOR ALL OF US TO THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT. ARE ELICITING SO MUCH PASSION RIGHT NOW -- REALLY QUICKLY GEO FENCING YOU CAN DRAW AN INVISIBLE LINE AROUND ANY BUILDING ANY LOCATION IN THE COUNTRY. AND TRACK EVERY SINGLE SMARTPHONE GOING IN AND OUT KEEP TRACK OF THEM. OSTENSIBLY TO ADVERTISE IN HOME DEVICES KNOW EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR HOME -- INCLUDE IF THEY TELL YOU WHETHER THAT MICROPHONE IN THEM OR NOT FOR THE RECORDING YOU'RE NOT -- APPS WE JUST SAW TWO WEEKS AGO AT IN ARTICLE THE WALL STREET JOURNAL WHERE WOMEN TRYING TO GET PREGNANT ARE. PUTTING THEIR MOST INTIMATE DETAILS OF OF THEIR LIFE INTO THIS APP AND WITHIN SECONDS OF THEM PUTTING IN THE INFORMATION IS THE OP. THE INFORMATION IS BEING TRANSMITTED TO FACEBOOK ON MIDDLE TO THEM THEY DIDN'T EVEN UP TO A FACEBOOK ACCOUNT FOR THAT -- THE POTENTIAL VOTING MANIPULATION IS IS IS HI. YOUR CAR'S ARE ESSENTIALLY DID A YOU KNOW GATHERING MACHINES ON WHEELS NOW THE NO VIEW THE GYM IF YOU ARE A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT IF YOU. WHAT TIME YOU TO WORK WHAT TIME YOU LEAVE UP AND AS IT YOU KNOW THIS INFORMATION HAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF VALUE? AS I LIKE TO SAY YOU KNOW A HUNDRED YEARS AGO STANDARD AWAY WITH THE MOST POWERFUL CORPORATION ON THE PLANET BUT STANDARD OIL TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. SO WHAT WITH THE TIME LINE I GOT THIS IDEA AROUND THE END OF TWENTY FIFTEEN I SPENT TWO YEARS. RESEARCHING IT TALKING TO AS MANY EXPERTS -- IN ACADEMIA ADVOCATES IN BUSINESSES LIKE COULD -- THAT RESULTED IN FILING THE INITIATIVE -- IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND CERTAIN TO GATHER SIGNATURES AT THE BEGINNING OF LAW. THROUGH APRIL IN JUNE I START HAVE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THIS BODY. PRIMARILY WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO. THOUGH EVENTUALLY. YOU KNOW IT TOOK A LOT OF PEOPLE AND IT IT TOOK A LOT OF ASSISTANCE THAT WOULD HAVE. HAPPENED I THINK IF OF IF THE CHAIR HAD NOT BEEN GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO PUT HER WEIGHT BEHIND IT AS WELL -- YOU KNOW AS I THINK ABOUT IT IT'S YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IS WHEN WE WERE GATHERED SIGNATURES WE ENDED UP COLLECTING MORE SIGNATURES THAN PEOPLE LIVE IN EITHER VERMONT OR WYOMING THIS IS A VERY POPULAR. ISSUE WE NEVER PULLED BELOW 80% CALIFORNIA'S REALLY CARE ABOUT THEIR PRIVACY. THERE WAS THE OPPOSITION COMMITTEE FORMED AND I JUST PUT THIS UP TO STE I DO THINK IT'S AN AMAZING AMERICAN STORY YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF MONEY RAISED TO GET AGAINST US BETWEEN THE THE COMPANIES THAT CONTRIBUTED DIRECTLY. TO US THE DAY GET TO THE COMMITTEE AGAINST US. AND REPRESENTING THE THE ASSOCIATION SERVES OVER SIX TRILLION MARKET CAP ARRAYED AGAINST ESSENTIALLY ONE INDIVIDUAL WHICH IS A REALLY THROW TRIBUTE TO AMERICA -- CALIFORNIA -- BUT IT WORKED AND MANY OF YOU WERE THERE. THAT DAY WAS TODAY WON'T SOON FORGET THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING MANAGER AND THE FACT IT WAS BIPARTISAN. AND UNANIMOUS -- TO ME IS A REAL INDICATION OF OF OF WHERE. THE STATE IS THAT -- SO WHAT DID WE ACTUALLY DO. WE THE THREE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE CPA. ONE IS THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT INFORMATION HAS BEEN COLLECTED ABOUT YOU. LET'S GO WITH ALL OF THE RIGHT TO KNOW. THE SECOND IS THE RIGHT TO SAY NO TO THE SALE OF THAT INFORMATION. TO HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT'S RIGHT AS AN OPT OUT RIGHT. THEN THE THIRD IS THE RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR INFORMATION KEPT SAFE IN A IN AN ERA OF IDENTITY THEFT THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT. STILL IT'S DRESS SOME OF THE MYTHS ONE OF THESE MYTHS IS THAT IT CAME TOGETHER IN A WEEK AND YOU KNOW WHO THE HECK IS ALSO RETIRED TO THE KIDS A PRIVACY EXPERTISE IT'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS WORKING IN THE SPACE. WELL IN FACT I DID TAKE TO REACH YOUR TO RESEARCH TO TRY TO TALK TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS I COULD BUT THE OTHER THING IS. WE BUILT IN MANY WAYS ON THE WORK OF EXPERTS THAT A COME BEFORE US SO YES I HADN'T SPENT TWENTY YEARS RESEARCHING IT BUT I CAN READ. AND THERE WERE A LOT OF GREAT IDEAS OUT THERE SO I'M GONNA GIVE YOU ONE LITTLE CASE STUDY OF OF OF ONE NIGHT ONE VERY CENTRAL PART OF OUR LAW. THERE IS THIS -- EFFORT CALLED DO NOT TRACK JIM EFFORT AND START ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO. W. THREE C. STANDS FOR THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONSORTIUM. AND THEY TOOK A GROUP OF TRUE COMPUTER COMPUTER EXPERTS AT THE INTERSECTION OF PRIVACY IN TECHNOLOGY. WHO CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA THAT YOUR BROWSER KATE? TO COMPANIES WHETHER YOU WANT TO BE TRACTOR NOT. THERE WAS A GOOD IDEA WORK TECHNICALLY THE PROBLEM WAS IT WAS BASED ON INVOLUNTARY. IT'S OF SOME COMPANIES AUTHORED AT SOME DID NOT THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY GENERALLY RESISTED IT. BUT AS A RESULT IT KIND OF ENDED UP FILLING. BUT NATIONAL EXPERTS HAD WORKED ON THIS FOR ALMOST A DECADE THIS IS THE ANTI TO ATTRACT. AND HERE'S THE HERE'S A LIST I THINK IT'S A PARTIAL LIST OF SOME OF THE YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE IN THIS BUSINESS THESE ARE COUPLED FACE NAMES WITH RESPECT. TO THE PEOPLE AT THE INTERSECTION OF PRIVACY IN TECHNOLOGY. FULL DISCLOSURE I GOT THIS OFF THE INTERNET SO IF PEOPLE ARE ON IT WHO DON'T WANT TO BE I APOLOGIZE TO PEOPLE WHO AREN'T ON IT THINK THEY SHOULD AGAIN I APOLOGIZE. NOW THE NEXT SLIDE I WANT TO BRING UP IS DON'T READ IT BECAUSE IT'S TOO HARD TO READ ALL THE WORDS BUT WHAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU WAS AT THE BOLD UNDERLINE PARTS THIS IS FROM OUR DEFINITION OF BUSINESS PURPOSES. ARE ALL DRAWN DIRECTLY FROM DO NOT TRACK SO AGAIN WE WERE BUILDING ON THE WORK OF EXPERTS THAT I'M WORKING ON THIS PROBLEM FOR A DECADE. OUR DEFINITION OF THIRD PARTY AGAIN VERY CENTRAL TO OUR LAW. THE BOLD UNDERLINE PARTS ARE DRAWN DIRECTLY FROM DO NOT TRACK SO AGAIN ONE OF THE MESSAGES HERE IS THAT THE THING DIDN'T COME TOGETHER IN A WEEK IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS AND BY THE WAY. WE RELIED ON EXPERT TO A GONE BEFORE. NOW. ANOTHER AREAS GOTTEN SOME ATTENTION IS YOU KNOW WHO'S COVERED -- BITE BY THE CPA. SO WE ONLY COVER BUSINESS NOT NONPROFITS NOT GOVERNMENT. AND BARS ARE IDEAL WAS LET'S GO WHERE THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE PROBLEMS WITH BIG BUSINESS AND IT A BROKER'S. SO WE HAVE THESE THREE THRESHOLDS TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN REVENUE FOR COMPANY -- OR COPY THE COLLECTS FIFTY THOUSAND PIECE OF INFORMATION A YEAR. FOR DATA BROKERS TO GET OVER HALF OF THEIR REVENUE. FROM SELLING INFORMATION. NOW THE FIFTY THOUSAND PIECES. OF INFORMATION HAS GOTTEN SOME ATTENTION GOT SOME CRITICISM BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY WELL IF YOU HAVE A SMALL LITTLE BLOG. IN YOUR COLLECTING ONLY A HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN PIECES YOU KNOW VISITORS A DAY YOU COULD HIT THAT FIFTY THOUSAND THRESHOLD. AND OUR ANSWER IS. OKAY BUT IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU'RE COLLECTING FROM PEOPLE. IF YOU'RE JUST COLLECTING AN I. P. ADDRESS. YOU CAN ACTUALLY IDENTIFY THE PERSON VISITING BECAUSE MULTIPLE PEOPLE CAN HAVE ONE I. P. ADDRESS. SO IN OUR LAW WE SAY LOOK A BUSINESS ISN'T OBLIGATED. TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION BACK IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE PERSON WITH CERTAINTY SO AN I. P. ADDRESS ALONE WOULD NOT BE PERSONAL INFORMATION. THAT SAID IF YOU'RE COLLECTING FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLES CREDIT CARDS AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION THEN INDEED THAT IS. PERSONAL INFORMATION UNDER THE LAW. NOW WHETHER THAT'S THE RIGHT. NUMBER OR NOT IN THE NATION WE HAD A HIGHER THRESHOLD WE HAD A HUNDRED THOUSAND AN INITIATIVE WE HAD IT JUST IF YOU WERE SELLING INFORMATION IN THE LAW. THE LEGISLATURE IN ITS WISDOM REDUCED IT TO FIFTY THOUSAND AND AND ITS COLLECTION BUT NEVER LESS THAT THE THAT THE BOB. A QUESTION FOR THIS COMMITTEE BUT BUT THE POINT IS YOU'RE DOING WITH THE INFORMATION. NOW LET'S TURN TO OPT IN VERSUS OPT OUT AND THIS IS A PRETTY -- CENTRAL PART OF OF THIS OF THE LAW SO. LET'S THINK ABOUT THE E. U. CHAIR REFERENCE GPR. WHICH CAME INTO EFFECT LAST MAY. SO. GPR IS OPT IN IT'S BASED ON WHAT'S CALLED NOTICE AND CONSENT IF YOU'VE BEEN A EUROPEAN WEBSITE YOU'VE SEEN THE LITTLE POP UP HOW BOUT NOW CAN BE COLLECTED AS A COOKIE HAVE I NOW HAVE A NOW. WE THINK THERE'S SOME PROBLEMS WITH UP WITH DOCTOR IN THERE SO OPERATIONAL ISSUES ONE IS SORT OF THIS CONTENT FATIGUE IT'S A KIND OF A CLOCK EXPERIENCE YOU GET THESE. POP UP ALL THE TIME THINK ABOUT NOW THE REST. THE SECOND IS THERE'S A THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED TO USE OVER WE WERE NEEDS TO KNOW YOUR CREDIT CARD IT NEEDS NO WE'RE GOING HE'S COLLECTOR INFORMATION. THE SORT OF THIS SORT OF LIKE WILL I WANNA USE UBER BUT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO CLICK MY INFORMATION SO THE FACT THAT -- AND ASK IF THEY CAN CLICK MY INFORMATION MAY NOT MEAN AS MUCH. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORTS UNDER WAY IN AND IN YOUR WE DON'T THINK IT'S SO MUCH CONTROLLED THE CUSTOMER. AND THEN THERE'S THIS INNOVATION CHILL ASPECT WHERE YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO GIVE CONSENT TO ACCOMPANY FIRST OF THE COLLECTOR INFORMATION AND WHEN YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF STILL BAND NEW COMPANY. IN EUROPE DOESN'T HAVE ARTS FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION OUR THRESHOLD MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM SO WITH OTHER SOME OPERATIONAL ISSUES TO OPTED. IN ADDITION WHEN WE WERE DOING THE RESEARCH I WAS TALKING AS MANY APHRODITE AS I COULD AND SOME EXPERTS ADVISE ME HEY LOOK. IF YOU COULD OPT IN YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM AND FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF CORPORATIONS. AND BECAUSE THIS IS THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I THINK ITS PURPOSE I'M A LITTLE DETAIL HERE BUT ESSENTIALLY. THERE'S A CASE -- BUT I WAS ADVISED ABOUT CULTURAL -- FOR SINUS HEALTH AT THE VERMONT DATA ABOUT CASE WHERE. FOR MY PASSED A LAW RESTRICTING PHARMACIES ABILITY. TO SELL. BOB PRESCRIBER IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. TWO DRUG MARKETING COMPANIES. THE DRUG WORKING COMPANIES TO GET TO THE SUPREME COURT AND AND ACTUALLY ONE AND THE LAW WAS THROWN OUT. AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING HERE IS THE AYE AYE SHE'S COMPOSED LANGUAGE FROM THE DECISION. BUT A RESTRICTION ON DISCLOSURE IS A REGULATION SPEECH THE SALE OF INFORMATION IS DISCLOSURE FOR PROFIT. AND IF THE ACT TO DISCLOSING PUBLIC INFORMATION DON'T COST IS BEACH IS HARD TO MEASURE WHAT DOES. SO THE ADVICE I GOT WAS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT DISPOSITIVE IS NOT A BLANKET RESTRICTION ON THE RIGHTS OF CORPORATIONS TO COLLECT INFORMATION YOU MAY BE RUNNING INTO THIS. ISSUE WHERE YOU HAVE A RESTRICTION OF THE FIRST MOMENT RIGHT TO CORPORATIONS NOW CONTRAST THAT WITH. AT THE DO NOT CALL FRAMEWORK. BUT DO NOT CALL. WITH ALL TO THE SUBJECT MONTH MULTIPLE LOSSES IN YOUR MEMBER YOU COULD PUT YOUR NAME ON A LIST AND SAY I DON'T WANT TO BE CONTACTED BY TELEMARKETERS ANYMORE. THIS WAS ALSO CHALLENGED. THIS WEEK ENDED UP BEING A TENTH CIRCUIT DECISION THAT ACTUALLY APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT THE SUPREME COURT DIDN'T. BOB AGREE TO HEAR AN AND THIS DECISION BASICALLY ENDED UP SAYING LOOK IF YOU'RE GIVING CONSUMERS ARE RIGHT. THAT'S FORMALLY DIFFERENT IT'S NOT TRAMPLING ON THE FIRST MEMBER RIGHT TO CORPORATIONS BECAUSE YOU'RE GIVING THE CONSUMER RIGHT TO GO DO SOMETHING WITH RESPECT TO A CORPORATION. SO THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY OPT OUT SEEM TO A SAFER BET IN ALWAYS GONNA SPEND ALL THIS MONEY I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND ALL THIS MONEY IN AN UP. IN A COURT FIGHT AND AND LOSE. AND THEN THE FINAL REASON WHY WE THINK OPT OUT. REALLY MAKES SENSE IS BECAUSE HOW WHAT'S THE EXPERIENCE GOING TO BE LIKE FOR THE CONSUMER SO. YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO TELL CORPORATION NOT TO SELL YOUR INFORMATION. HOW DO YOU DO THAT WE REQUIRE THAT COMPANIES PUT A DO NOT SELL MY INFORMATION BUTTON YOU CAN CLICK? BUT YOU CAN KIND OF IMAGINE THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT CLUNKY ALWAYS HAVE TO CLICK THAT AS WELL [inaudible] SO. WHAT WE REQUIRE IS THAT COMPANIES HAVE TO HONOR A THIRD PARTY OPT OUT REQUEST AND WHAT IS THAT MEAN IN REAL LIFE? IN REAL LIFE I'M GONNA TALK TO THE BROWSER COMPANIES. AND THEY SAID LOOK WE WERE DOING THIS FOR DO NOT TRACK OF COURSE IF IT'S A LAW WILL DO THIS WE WOULD WE WOULD PUT A BROWSER EXTENSION INTO EVERYBODY'S BROWSER. ALLOW YOU TO SAID IT ONCE AND FORGET. EVERY VISIT TO EVERY WEBSITE YOU MAKE THE BROWSER FOR YOU WILL JUST INDICATE TO THAT WEBSITE DON'T SELL MY INFORMATION. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE WE'VE ACHIEVED DO NOT TRACK THROUGH LEGISLATION ALL THAT WORK THAT DOES EXPERTS DID FOR OVER A DECADE WE'VE ESSENTIALLY ACHIEVED DO NOT TRACK BY ANOTHER ROUTE. AND WE THINK IT'S A REALLY MOMENTOUS STEP FOR THIS LAW. WE THINK THAT THAT IS. THE END OF THE LARGE COMPANIES TRACKING ACROSS THE WEB AND WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT IT AS A BUSINESS PERSON IS I THINK IT'S SIMPLE FOR CONSUMERS YOU DON'T TO DO VERY MUCH. WANTS YOU TO SET THAT IN YOUR BROWSER. AND FORGET IT. BUT THE MOVE TO ADVERTISING WHICH ALSO HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT CONTENTIOUS IN THE SENSE THAT. WE PERMIT ADVERTISING. THE LAW PERMITS ADVERTISING AND YOU KNOW. THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THEY SAY WELL THEY CAN TRACK YOU THROUGH ADS AND AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU HAVEN'T REALLY DONE MUCH. AND THE POINT IS WELL IF WE DON'T PRMIT ADVERTISING WE KIND OF DO WRECKED INTERNET SO YOU'VE GOT. TO HAVE SOME KIND OF BOUNCE BUT TO GO BACK TO POINT IS WHERE IS THE BALANCE. THE ONE WHERE WE DREW THE LINE IS WE SAID OKAY YOU CAN DO THE ADS BUT YOU CAN'T RESELL THE INFORMATION SO LITTLE QUICK TUTORIAL. WHEN YOU SEE AN AD ONLINE THAT MEANS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN ABOUT MOMENT AUCTIONED OFF IN OUR WITH COLOR REAL TIME DID? THE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF COMPANIES. EVERY TIME YOU SEE THAT WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT OR NOT. AND IN MANY CASES WITH SOME AS MOST CASES THAT INFORMATION IS RETAINED BY THE WINNING BIDDER AND THE LOSING BIDDERS. WHICH IS HOW YOUR INFORMATION JUST GETS PROPAGATED JUST BY JUST BEING ON THE INTERNET. SO. WHAT ARE LAW WOULD SAY IS SURE YOU CAN STILL CONDUCT THE AUCTION? BUT THE INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY STOP THE DIES AT THE BY THE RECIPIENT. THE LOSING BIDDERS CAN'T RETAIN IT CAN'T REUSE IT CAN'T RESELLER. AND SO. AGAIN WE WERE TRYING TO STRIKE THIS BALANCE THAT YOU WERE TALKING TO LINDA EARLIER HOW DO YOU PERMIT COMMERCE. BUT ACTUALLY PUT SOME REASONABLE LIMITS ON WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO THE INFORMATION. ADDITIONAL RIGHTS UNDER THE CPA. WE GIVE THE CONSUMER THE RIGHT TO DELETE INFORMATION IS POSTED THAT'S OF HAVE TO WORK WITH THE FIRST AMENDMENT SO THERE'S NOT A EUROPEAN RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN BECAUSE THAT WILL WORK IN THIS COUNTRY. WE INCREASED PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN OF THE OFF THE AGE OF OFTEN IS INCREASED FROM. THIRTEEN TO SIXTEEN HAVING TO SPEND ALL THAT TIME AN OPT OUT YOU MIGHT BE SAYING WHAT'S UP WITH ABOUT BUT IT IS BECAUSE CHILDREN ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY SENATOR MORE PROTECTED CLASS. AND THEN COMPANIES WE SAID THE COMPANIES CAN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST YOU IF YOU SAY NO TO THE SALE OF YOUR DATA -- SO YOU CAN'T ALL OF A SUDDEN SAY NO YOUR CELL PHONE COMPANIES OF SOME I DID AND GET A THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR A MONTH CHARGE. YOU KNOW -- ON YOUR ON YOUR CELL PHONE WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY COURSE EVERYBODY INTO INTO SAYING YES TO THE SALE THIRD. ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN A HOT BUTTON. EIJI ENFORCES BY THE ACT. WE HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION SO CONSUMERS CAN SUE FOR NEGLIGENT DATA BREACHES AND WHAT THOSE ARE ARE. THERE THREE SAFE HARBORS IF THE COMPANY IS ENCRYPTED THE DATA. IF THEY REDACTED THE MEANS TO CURE NAME OUT OF THE DATA SAID. FOR IF THERE WERE REASONABLE SECURITY PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE DATA THEN THERE. VENDOR BUT THAT THEY'RE SAFE HARBORS FROM THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION OTHERWISE IS A PART RIGHT OF ACTION FOR DATA BREACH. ESSENTIALLY THE REASON FOR THAT IS I DIDN'T WANT HAVE A SITUATION WHERE A COMPANIES DOING ITS LEVEL BEST TO COMPLY AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT OF THE NORTH KOREANS. YOU KNOW HACK INTO THE COMPANY -- SOME LIABILITIES AS LONG AS YOU'RE DOING YOUR BEST EVEN CREEK THAT YOU'RE FINE WITH YOU SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY FOR COLLECTING PEOPLE'S INFORMATION. WITH RESPECT AGING FORSMAN THAT IT'S GOT A LITTLE ATTENTION RECENTLY. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THIS WAS PART OF THE? THE SENT TO DEAL THAT CAME TOGETHER IN OUR INITIATIVE WE HAD A PRIOR RIGHT OF ACTION FOR EVERYTHING. AND WE REDUCED IT TO JUST THE NEGATIVE DATA BREACH. BUT WE GOT A LOT IN RETURN WE GOT. THE RIGHT TO SEE ACTUAL INFORMATION INITIATIVE A JUST HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEE CATEGORIES. BUT WE GOT THE RIGHT TO DELETE WE GOT OFTEN AGE INCREASE IT WAS JUST IT WITH THE DEAL. WE WE DID A DEAL BETWEEN -- WE REDUCE THE SCOPE OF THE PRIME RATE ACTION AND GOT BETTER PROTECTION FOR KIDS. I'VE FOR FOR FOR CONSUMERS I WOULD DO IT AGAIN I THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AT THE TIME I STILL THINK IT'S READY TO DO. WITH RESPECT TO CHANGES PEOPLE BASS ABOUT CHANGES AND YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS THE COMMITTEE THAT WILL DECIDE -- I IT YOU KNOW -- I'M I'M I'M JUST A THIS. INDIVIDUAL AND AND SO. MANY OF ASK ME NOR MY WORRIED ABOUT WE'RE LAW NOW TIME FOR BUSINESS TO COME BACK IN AND GOT IT AND DID YOU FEEL LIKE A FOOL AND WHAT I SAY IS. ABSOLUTELY ON THE ON THE TOTALLY ON THE OPPOSITE -- IN MY TRAVELS. HAVE YOU MET THE PEOPLE WHO THE LOS MINIMUM IN WHOSE HANDS Là REST NOW. I FEEL EVEN BETTER ABOUT HAVING DONE AND I WOULD DO IT AGAIN IN A HEARTBEAT BECAUSE I I FEEL LIKE. THE THE PEOPLE I'VE I'VE ABOUT ENCOUNTERED REALLY WANT TO MAKE THIS THE BEST LAW FOR FOR THE STATE GOING FORWARD -- AND OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGES AND I'M NOT. SOME YOU KNOW -- DIE HARD IS IS IS YOU KNOW THIS THESE THESE THINGS CAME DOWN FROM OUTSIDE AB YOU KNOW I'M I'M BY MILITANT. IF ANYBODY WANTS MY PIN AND WILLING TO GIVE IT -- SO I'M GONNA CLOSE HERE WITH. WHERE I FIND OUT WHERE I THINK TB IS IN A HISTORICAL CONTEXT? IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE RISE THE AUTO SAFETY MOVEMENT IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES. YEAH BUT APPOINT CARDS HAVE BEEN MASS PRODUCED FOR FORTY YEARS ON A PER ON ON PRODUCTION LINES AND SAFETY REALLY HADN'T. GONE ANYWHERE UNTIL. THE UNSAFE AT ANY SPEED NADER AND ALL OF A SUDDEN PEOPLE WERE LIKE OH MAYBE WE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO SAFETY. IF YOU THINK OF THE RISE OF TOBACCO AND ANTI SMOKING. EFFORTS IN THE SIXTIES. YOU KNOW CIGARETTE TO MASS PRODUCE FOR EIGHTY YEARS BY THAT. THIS IS THIS AN ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGY. IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW AUTO EMISSIONS AND TRYING TO GET CLEANER AIR IN THE SEVENTIES THIS STATE OBVIOUSLY TOOK THE LEAD. RETIRED NOT BE ABLE TO LOG ACROSS LOS ANGELES. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THREE OF THOSE EXAMPLES IN ALL THREE OF THOSE EXAMPLES. WE THE PEOPLE. ACTING THROUGH OUR REPRESENTATIVES. SAID HEY YOU KNOW THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE ANYMORE THIS IS AN ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGY. BUT YOU INDUSTRY CAN AND SHOULD DO BETTER. YOU NEED TO DO BETTER. AT FIRST INDUSTRY RESISTED IN ALL THOSE CASES YOU KNOW WITH THE FIRSTLY. BUT NOW DESTROYED IMAGINE SELLING A CAR WITH A SEAT BELTS ARE WITH AN AIRBAG. YOU KNOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE AND GUESS WHAT. BUSINESS MADE PLENTY OF MONEY ALONG THE WAY. AND IT'S SURVIVED AND THRIVED. AND I THINK WE'RE IN SUCH A SITUATION RIGHT NOW WTH RESPECT TO PRIVACY I THINK THAT -- CALIFORNIA IS NOW. A WORLDWIDE LEADER IN PRIVACY. THE FEDS MAY OR MAY NOT DO SOMETHING THEY MAY OR MAY NOT PREEMPT OTHER STATES MAY OR MAY NOT PASS BUT TODAY ONE IN EIGHT AMERICANS IS COVERED BY THIS LAW WHICH GOES INTO EFFECT NEXT YEAR. AND I THINK IS A AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS ROOM IN YOUR HANDS. BECAUSE WE ARE AT THE WE'RE WE'RE THE STATE IS SO OFTEN WERE IN THE VANGUARD OF REALLY IMPORTANT A SOCIETAL. CHANGES INACTION THIS FRANKLY INTERNATIONAL WE WORK WE'RE A COUNTRY WERE THE FIFTH LARGEST COMING THE WORLD. IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE THAT WERE HERE. THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TECHNICAL TALENT AND AND AND AND POLITICAL TELL AROUND THE ROOM AND I'M I'M. I'M HUMBLED TO BE PART OF THIS AND I WANT TO SAY AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR OF YOUR WORK IN THIS EFFORT IT REALLY WAS IT ONE PERSON KIND OF STEPPING UP. AND AN ISSUE THAT MANY OF US HAVE. FOUND TO BE WITH THE MORE WE'VE KNOWN -- FRUSTRATING AND I WANT -- TO OF THE INCIDENT THAT IT THAT YOU JUST REFERENCE TWO WEEKS AGO WE LEARNED THAT. OF WOMEN WHO WERE -- TRYING -- TO PERHAPS GET PREGNANT AND PUTTING INFORMATION INTOTHEIR FITBIT'S. OF THE DESCRIBED AS THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE SO THAT THEY KNOW WHEN THEY'RE OVULATING. THAT FACEBOOK WOULD GET THAT INFORMATION WITHOUT ANYONE'S KNOWLEDGE OR PERMISSION IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY AND I THINK AN EXAMPLE OF A SOME OF THE MORE. OUTRAGEOUS BUT STILL EXISTING -- POTENTIALS I MEAN I I THINK ABOUT IT YOU DON'T WANT YOUR MOTHER TO KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO GET PREGNANT YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT SOMEBODY. WHO'S A COMPLETE STRANGER TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION EITHER. AND THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT WE ARE SEEING SO -- YOUR EFFORTS REALLY HAVE I THINK MADE AN EXTRAORDINARY DIFFERENCE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU PUBLICLY FOR YOUR FOR DOING THAT -- I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION -- AND I I REALIZE THAT THIS WAS A A WHITE KNUCKLE OR AND BOTH A A KNUCKLE IN WHITE KNUCKLE EFFORT BECAUSE TO GET THOSE INDUSTRIES THE SIX TRILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF OPPOSITION TO COME TO THE TABLE AND TO RESOLVE THIS WAS AT BEFORE THE INITIATIVE WAS QUITE AN EFFORT. BUT I WONDER IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH US -- WHAT MORE IT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO EFFECTUATE YOUR INTENT? RECOGNIZING THEIR COMPROMISES MADE BUT IF YOU WERE AS I OFTEN ASK THE MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE WHAT WOULD YOU DO MORE. TO EFFECTUATE YOUR INTENT. YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK -- THE THE THE PART THAT WAS FOR THE MOST PAINFUL FOR ME GIVING UP. WAS THE WHISTLEBLOWER -- WE ARE WITH THE BOAT BLOWER PROVISION IN THAT -- AND THAT WAS HARD BECAUSE I FELT LIKE SOMETIMES DEEP IN THE BOWELS THESE COMPANIES YOU'RE YOU IT COULD BE HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND IF YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE SOPHISTICATED -- TO TAKE A CHANCE SO THAT'S KIND OF AN AREA I THINK -- I THINK THAT THERE ARE -- SOME CLARIFICATIONS THAT COULD BE MADE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE -- I KNOW. HOUSEHOLDS GOTTEN A LOT OF PRESS BECAUSE HOUSEHOLD WAS PUT IN AT THE LAST MINUTE WASN'T IN OUR INITIATIVE -- THERE'S SOME REAL -- REASONS THAT EIGHTY EIGHT THE NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AT THE SAME TIME IT DOES THE DEFINITION SO THERE THERE'S THINGS LIKE THAT SO I THINK TO SOME CLARIFYING LE. AREAS -- BUT HONESTLY I MEAN I I WILL SAY THAT THE THE ODD CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE HAVING THAT INITIATIVE AND HAVING. SOMETHING WHERE THE COMPANY'S UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS IS PULLING AND THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT. TO GET EIGHTY DOWN A FIFTY WAS GONNA COST A A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT BE WAS GONNA REQUIRED THEM TO BE SPENDING MONEY AGAINST THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS SOME OF THEIR CUSTOMERS CARE ABOUT THE NEW THAT WAS KIND OF UNTENABLE SO THAT WAS A IT WAS AN ODD DYNAMIC. WHICH I DON'T THINK WOULD EXIST -- INITIAL SITUATIONS AND SO WE DID HAVE QUITE A LOT OF POWER TO TO SORT OF SAY THIS IS THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE IN AND WE END UP I THINK WITH A GREAT LAW. THANK YOU I WILL START WITH MISTER VICE CHAIR AND THEN A SENATOR MONEY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. KIND OF WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION IS. YOUR INFORMATION FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT AS FAR AS YOU'RE AWARE. WHO OWNS YOUR INFORMATION IS THAT A PRIVATE? OWNERSHIP IS A PROPRIETARY OR AT WHAT POINT DOES BECOME PUBLIC DOMAIN. ARE THERE ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANY CASE LAW THAT. ARTICULATES WHEN YOUR INFORMATION IS YOUR OWN AND TRANSFER IN OUR SHIP TRANSFERS UPON A SERIES OF EVENTS. I'M GONNA INSTEAD I'M A LOOK BACK AT MY LORD IS TO MAKE SURE -- TEAMS SINCE YOUR VIEW WHAT COMMITMENTS AS WELL BUT IN THE MEANTIME IF YOU ADDED THAT THE CHAIR FOR IT WAS OKAY IF HE CAME UP NO PROBLEM. MISTER HARRISON. HARRISON BUT WITH ALL ANSWERED FOR NOW IS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ISSUES. THAT WE WE WE ENCOUNTERED IS -- WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT ONE OF OUR DID WAS TO MAKE IT A PROPERTY RIGHT [inaudible] AND THE ISSUE THERE'S WE RAN INTO ADVOCATES WHO SAID WOULD YOU CAN'T MAKE IT PROPER RIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN ALIENATE A PROPERTY RIGHT AND THE SHOULD BE SOMETHING AKIN TO A CIVIL RIGHT THAT YOU CAN'T ALIENATE RIGHT. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS AT THIS POINT THAT. THE COMPANIES ON YOUR DATA WHICH FEELS WEIRD DOESN'T LIKE IT FEELS WEIRD THAT YOU WOULD GIVE ALL THAT INFORMATION TO THEM AND THEN THEY OWN IT. IF YOU CAN MAKE A FLORA AND I'M I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY CASE LAW ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE ENCOUNTERED IN CRAFTING THE MEASURE IS HOW TO DEAL WITH. INFORMATION SOME OF WHICH IS VOLUNTARILY POSTED SOMETIMES WITH RESTRICTIONS SUCH AS IF YOU LIMIT YOUR FACEBOOK SETTINGS TO STIR FRIENDS SOMETIMES WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTIONS AT ALL AND ONCE INFORMATION ENTERS THE PUBLIC DOMAIN IT'S VERY. DIFFICULT TO ATTACH ANY SORT OF PROPERTY RIGHT TO IT WAS CLEAR THIS IS THE WILD WEST -- AREA OF OF THE LOGS WOULD NOT GET LEADERS AS I'M AWARE OF IT. NOW GOING BACK TO THE DO NOT CALL LIST WAS AT A NATIONAL CLEARINGHOUSE OR WAS THAT A STATE WHAT WAS. THAT WHAT IT MY UNDERSTANDING A AND THE STATE'S -- DID AND THEN I THINK EVENTUALLY THERE WASN'T A NATIONAL -- BUT IT READ IT IT IT IT IT STARTED WITH THE STATE'S AND I AS I BELIEVE THAT MR MARKETING WAS A STATE -- CASE. SO IN YOUR ODYSSEY. OF PURSUING THIS DID YOU CONTEMPLATE THAT MAY BE A CLEARING HOUSE STYLE AT THE STATE LEVEL. WOULD TAKE AWAY -- ALL THE UNCERTAINTIES FOR THOSE THAT DON'T WANT TO PARTICIPATE. IN IN THE INFORMATION EXCHANGING TECHNOLOGY. I CAN TO A DO NOT CALL LIST. WE DID IN ON IT FRANKLY ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE DOING WAS WHEN WE'RE DOING INITIATIVE WE WERE TRYING TO CRAFT SOMETHING THAT WOULD SURVIVE. WITHOUT ANY OBVIOUS ATTACK. VECTORS OF ATTACK AGAINST IT AND SO THE IDEA OF CREATING UP LIKE AN AGENCY OR SOMETHING WAS GOING. TO THEIR HOUSE TAKE TAKE SOME MONEY. AND WE KNEW THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING FOR THE OPPONENTS TO BE LIKE OH YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO BUILD AN AGENCY SO THEY COULD MAYBE ATTACK US ON THAT. SO WE WERE TRYING TO GET SOME OF THE ESSENTIALLY CARDS ON WEIGHT -- SO THAT'S ON IS WHAT WE DIDN'T PURSUE THAT ROUTE. COM WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR WOULD YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR US I'M SORRY RECORD I'M JAMES HARRISON FROM RANCHO JOHANNSON PURCELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU M. M. MY LACK LAST QUESTION ARE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE. YOU'VE HEARD OF ALEXA THE SO WE HAVE ALEXIS SPEAKER MYHOUSE WILL MIGHT MY KIDS NAME HAPPENS TO BE A LACK OF YOU CAN IMAGINE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WHEN I'M KILLING AT MY KID IN ALEXIS SAYS. SOMETHING IN RESPONSE. TO MAKE FOR SOME INTERESTING -- DIALOGUE IN THE IN THE IN THE IN THE HOUSE BUT IN TERMS OF JURISDICTION. GIVEN THAT WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY INTERSTATE COMMERCE -- SITUATIONS HERE WHERE ENTITIES ARE LOCATED -- IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE NATION OR OR BROAD. TRANSACTIONS ARE COMPLETED IN THE UNITED STATES. HOW DOES THE JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITY -- ISSUE PLAY OUT IF THERE IS A OPT OUT OR EVEN AN OFTEN WITH ENTITIES THAT ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OR EVENINTERNATIONALLY. HOW WOULD THAT WOULD THEY JUST SIMPLY BE IN VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA LAW? A LED TEAMS TALK TO MORE THE DETAILS BUT ESSENTIALLY SINCE WE GIVE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER RIGHTS. THAT'S ANYBODY DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA HAS TO HAVE TO GIVE THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER RIGHTS. YOUR MOTHER IN THEIR RIGHTS IN A LET YOU TALK ABOUT -- INTERSTATE COMMERCE RIGHT TO TO TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE -- THE LAW INCLUDES AN EXCEPTION. TO ENSURE THAT IF A XIN OCCURS ENTIRELY OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA EVEN IF INVOLVED A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT SO THAT THE BUSINESS THAT OBTAINS THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS INFORMATION. OBTAINS IT WHEN THAT RESIDENT AS OUT OF STATE. SELLS IT IN A TRANSACTION TO ANOTHER COMPANY THAT'S ALSO OUT OF STATE THAT IS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF THIS LAW TO AVOID A COMMERCE BECAUSE CHALLENGE THANK. THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- IN ANA THINK MR MCTAGGART FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS PARTICULARLY. YEAR COLLABORATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO ACHIEVE WHAT YOU OUTLINED IN IS NOW. LAW OR HER SOON TO BE LINE CALIFORNIA -- ON THIS LAST POINT. IS IS THERE ANY WAY. TO PROTECT THE CALIFORNIA. RESIDENT CONSUMER USING THEIR COMPUTER OUT OF STATE YOU YOU RAISE THE CONCERN OF THE COMMERCE. CLAUSE [inaudible] WORKING. MOVING FORWARD IS THERE SOMEWHERE WE COULD LOOK AT THAT. BUTTRESS THE RATE OF A TRAVELING CALIFORNIA RESIDENT. IT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT COULD BE PURSUED FURTHER I THINK IN MOST INSTANCES THERE WILL BE SOME CONTACT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK IT WOULD BE UNLIKELY THAT YOU WOULD. HAVE TOO MANY INSTANCES IN WHICH THE ENTIRE TRANSACTION TAKES PLACE OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIAAND THERE'S NO CONTACT BETWEEN. THAT BUSINESS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE COULD CERTAINLY PURSUE FURTHER. THANK YOU. SO IN THE AREA OF AUTO EMISSIONS MISTER MAKE TAG OR SHOW TO SOME OF OUR LEGAL GOVERNMENT CONSUMER PROTECTION ADVANCES THROUGH THE DECADES. ONE THING THAT WE'VE DONE WITH OUR AIR STANDARDS IS AUTO MANUFACTURERS NOW BUILD THEIR CARS TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS SO WE SET THE PACE IN VEHICLES SOLD IN OKLAHOMA KENTUCKY. HAS THE SAME PROTECTIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GONNA MANUFACTURE DIFFERENT CARS. IS THERE ANY. MOVEMENT TOWARDS OTHER STATES ADOPTING WHAT WE'VE DONE AND OR MORE. WHERE WE OUT WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOOKING AT THIS? SO I'VE BEEN -- TO WASHING A COUPLE TIMES TO TALK TO VARIOUS MEMBERS ABOUT IT I THINK IT'S NOT LOST ON ANYONE THAT 20% OF THE HOUSE MAJORITY IS FROM THE STATE -- INCLUDING SOME IMPORTANT COMMITTEE CHAIRS -- AND WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM EVERYBODY'S THUS FAR THERE IS THAT -- A BILL TO PREEMPT CALIFORNIA WITH A WEAKER STANDARD WON'T HAPPEN -- THEY WILL LET US. YOU KNOW I THINK IS PLENTY OF NATIONAL EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLE HIPPA THE HEALTH LAW AND SHE'LL BE A GRAMM LEACH BLILEY THE FINANCIAL LAW. ARE BOTH WITH THE CALL FLOORS NOT CEILINGS THE SET NATIONAL STANDARDS. BUT THEY LET THE STATE'S GO BEYOND I THINK THAT THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO HERE. MY FINAL POINT ON THIS IS THE THERE I THINK TECH IS TRYING TO SELL THIS. WORRY THAT -- FIFTY DIFFERENT STANDARDS WE CAN'T APPLY AND MY ANSWER TO THAT IS TO TWO POINT YOU JUST RAISED. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY UNTENABLE FOR CONSUMER FACING COMPANY. ON JANUARY SECOND NEXT YEAR TO SAY THE RESIDENTS OF NEW YORK. OR ILLINOIS OR OR TEXAS HEY BY THE WAY ALL YOUR GOAL TO BE YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES IN CALIFORNIA NOW RIGHT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE I JUST I DON'T SEE THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. SO I AM NOT PARTICULAR WORD BY THE FIFTY STATES THING AND EVEN IF THERE WERE FIFTY STATES LIQUOR FIFTY DIFFERENT DATA RICH LAWS AND YOU KNOW WHAT. BUSINESS KEEPS ON GOING. SO A FEW YEARS AGO I CARRIED LEGISLATION UNSUCCESSFULLY LOOKING AT THE AUTO INDUSTRY. WE NOW HAVE COMPUTERS ON WHEELS. NEW BY THE VEHICLE IT'S YOURS YOU OWN IT. BUT IT CONTINUALLY IS GENERATING DATA -- THAT IS USED BY INSURANCE COMPANIES SOLD TO INSURANCE COMPANIES -- THE CONTRACT YOUR ROOTS AND KNOW THAT YOU GO BY THIS DENNY'S RESTAURANT EVERY DAY AND THEN YOU START GETTING. EMAIL SIR FACEBOOK POSTINGS ABOUT DENNY'S RESTAURANT IN SANTA ANA OR WHATEVER MAYBE. SO. I OWN THE VEHICLE. I ON THE COMPUTER. BUT I DON'T ON THE RIGHT. TO OPT IN OR OPT OUT OR CONTROL YOU KNOW THIS THIS. LARA PROTECT DATA THAT'S BEING GENERATED FROM OUR VEHICLES. YES WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO SELL THE THAT THE COMPANIES DON'T SELL MY INFORMATION. THAT THEY CAN STILL COLLECTED -- FOR SPECIFIED PURPOSES LIKE FOR WARRANTY FOR THAT KIND OF THING FOR FOR MAINTENANCE FOR BE FOR SAFETY. BUT THEY COULDN'T AND BY THE WAY ON THAT WE THE AUTO INDUSTRY WHO SAID YOU KNOW HOW OFTEN YOU YOU BUY A NEW CAR YOU LEASE NEW CAR AND THEY SAY OH BE PART OF THAT ONSTAR SOMETHING WILL. AND THEN AFTER THE THREE MONTHS IS A NOW WOULD LIKE TO START CHARGING. WHAT THEY STARTED DOING NOW IS IF YOU SAY NO THEY STILL KEEP IT ON YOU KNOW WHY BECAUSE THE DATA IS SO MUCH MORE VALUABLE FOR THEM TO COLLECT? IN YOUR MONTHLY FOR YOUR MONTHLY FREE LIKE OFFERED YOU FOR FREE THANK AND MY FINAL QUESTION MADAM CHAIR IT RELATES TO YOUR COMMENT ABOUT THE BIT SOME. DEVICE THE APPLICATION THAT CAN ALLOW THE OWNER. TO TO TRACK CERTAIN HEALTH DATA. BUT BUILT INTO THAT IS A CONNECTION TO A FACEBOOK -- APPLICATION BUT THAT'S DOESN'T APPEAR ANYWHERE ON THE PEACE HOW DOES THIS LAW. PROTECT THE CONSUMER FROM THAT SCENARIO OR DOES IT. WELL IF YOU TOLD -- FITBIT IN THIS CASE NOT TO SELL YOUR INFORMATION AGAIN WE DO HAVE THESE OPERATIONAL WILL BECOME BUSINESS PURPOSES WHERE THAT DATA CAN BE TRANSFERRED. BUT IN THAT CASE IF IF IT WAS RELYING ON A BUSINESS PURPOSE EXCEPTION TO TRANSFER THE DATA BETWEEN FITBIT SAN FACEBOOK. FACEBOOK WOULDN'T BE ABLE. TO COMBINED THAT DATA WITH EVERYTHING ELSE TO KNOW ABOUT YOU SO IT ONLY REALLY BE ABLE TO USE THAT DATA IN CONTEXT WITH IN THE CONTACTED FITBIT. AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THAT IF YOU GO TO THE LA TIMES. FACEBOOK IN ABOUT YOU WHILE YOU'RE ON THE LA TIMES YOU GO TO THE CHRONICLE FACEBOOK IN -- BUT YOU ON THE CHRONICLE BUT I CAN'T COMBINE AT SO CAN'T TRACK YOU FOR THE CONSUMER WHO OP SO THEY CAN TRACK YOU. ACROSS EVERY PAGE YOU VISIT ON THE WEB AND COMBINE ALL THAT INTO ONE GIANT DATABASE SO IN AN ACCENT WAS MY FINAL QUESTION BUT ACTIONS ARE ON MORE WILL GIVE YOU ONE MORE. MOVING FORWARD. WHEN THIS LAW BECOMES IN EFFECT WHAT ABOUT DATA THAT'S ALREADY BEEN COLLECTED CAN WE GO RETROACTIVELY AND SAY WHATEVER DATA YOU COLLECTED OF MINE -- UP TO JANUARY OF I'M TWENTY AIRED WHENEVER IT GOES INTO EFFECT -- DO WE HAVE A THE ABILITY TO REACH BACK TO PROTECT DATA THAT THEY MAY ALREADY. POSSESS NO WE WE WE WANT TO DRAW A LINE THE SENTENCE WERE. GIVEN TO STAY STANDING START AND SO -- IT'S IT'S MOVING FORWARD FROM THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOUS A CENTER WHITE HOUSE CAN I GET SEVEN QUESTION AND YOUR COMMENT ON THE RIGHT TO DELETE I'M SURE IT CONSUMERS LIKE THAT THE EXCELLENT STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT SOME BROAD EXCEPTIONS THERE'S NO SECURITY. THE DETECTION MAKES SENSE TE BUGGING YOU KNOW -- PUBLIC INTEREST INFORMATION THEN WE HAVE THIS RATHER LARGE -- THE BUSINESSES. AND ALL I CAN THINK OF IS SAID BAKER BUT THE WEDDING CAKE IN -- EXERTING THEIR RIDE AND I WANTED TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THAT IS IT TO MAKE IT MEANINGFUL FOR THAT THE RIVER THE WHAT I EXPECT I THINK SOME CONSUMERS OF THE RIGHT TO DELETE. MY PERSONAL INFORMATION SO. YOU KNOW WE LIVE IN THAT COUNTRY WAS STRONG FIRST MATTER RIGHTS -- AND ONE OF THE BY NOT TO NOT AT YOUR QUESTION BOWED TO ANSWER A DIFFERENT WAY ONE OF THE WAYS TO THINK ABOUT THIS BILL AS WE GIVE THE EIGHT A TURNING GENERAL TREMENDOUS ABILITY OR POWER. TO ISSUE REGULATIONS IN FURTHERANCE OF THE ACT. AND SO MIGHT INTENTION WAS NOT TO SET SOME IN STONE AND SAY THAT'S A FOREVER THING BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS MOVING WITH THE TIMES AND SO THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WHERE YOU COULD SAY OKAY THIS IS WHAT THE REGULATION MEANS AND THEN TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU. FIND IS BEING ABUSED. OR THE NEEDS FIXING YOU COULD PROBABLY FIX THAT WITH THE REGULATION FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ENFORCING SO IS MY IS MY HOPE. THAT THE I THINK THE REASON WE PUT IT IN THERE IS BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING YOU-NEEDED. TO PUT IN IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE. TO NOT TRAMPLE ON FIRST MEMORIZE FOR THE THE THE WAY THE BOUNCING BALL WOULD WORK AS THEY HAVE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION I ASK HIM TO TAKE IT OUT. THEY SAY NO THIS IS A FREE SPEECH EXPRESSION THAT I ASKED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SUE FOR ME. YEAH I THINK WHAT WOULD PROBABLY HAPPEN IS IS MULTIPLE PEOPLE TO HEY LOOK THIS IS LOCAL COMPANIES DURING THE USE THIS IS A LOOPHOLE THEY'RE SAYING IT'S ALL FIRST MEMORIZE BUT NO ONE'S ACTUALLY DELETE YOUR INFORMATION AND THEN THAT WOULD BECOME A THING. AND I THINK THAT THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD STEP IN THE EVENING. YEAH. WITCHES SO AS YOU KNOW PUTTING QUITE A BURDEN ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THERE IS SAID AS WELL ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT OF THANK YOU SENATOR I JUST WANT TO CORRECT SOMETHING SORRY ALL RIGHT WAS WRONG PLEASE. ONE PERFECT CATION -- THAT THE TEXT OF THE MEASURE APPLIED ONLY TO INFORMATION COLLECTED AFTER TO AFFECTED DATE THAT PROVISION IS NOT IN THE C. C. P. ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. RIGHT SO WHAT ARE THE CONTENTS WHAT WOULD THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT BE WOULD THAT MEAN THAT WE COULD GO BACK AT RETROACTIVELY JANUARY WILL BE ABLE TO GO BACK AT THE YEAR. IT'S IT'S A YEAR IN IN IN IN IN -- IN. YOU LOOK BACK HERE. HI THAT'S VERY HELPFUL AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND TO ALL THE HARD WORK YOU'VE DONE AND I KNOW YOUR DAUGHTERS SITTING HERE -- YOUR DADDY ROCKS [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. AND I DIDN'T GET PAID TO SAY THAT AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH ELSE. OUR NEXT PANEL -- IS TALKING. WE'RE GOING TO COMPARE THE CCPA. WITH ITS COUNTERPARTS AND TAKE A LOOK AT COMPLIANCE WITH -- ARE -- THREE WITNESSES PLEASE FIFTEEN MINUTES EACH AND THEN WE WILL AFTER THEY OF ALL PROVIDED THEIR TESTIMONY OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS SO WE HAVE. A FIRST WITH US LYDIA DILATORY WHO IS THE PROFESSOR AND CO DIRECTOR. OF THE DATA PRIVACY CERTIFICATE PROGRAM AT SANTA CLARA LAW SCHOOL. OF FOLLOW BY JESSICA B. LEE WHO IS A PARTNER IN THE CULTURE OF THE PRIVACY SECURITY AND DATA INNOVATIONS -- DEPARTMENT AT LAW OPEN LOW. L. L. P.. AND THEN OUR THIRD. AND FINAL -- MEMBER OF THIS PANEL THIS ARIAL FARC'S JOHNSON WHO IS SENIOR COUNSEL FOR THE POLICY AND PRIVACY -- ASPECT TO THE COMMON SENSE MEDIA KIDS ACTION GROUP WHICH HAS BEEN. A VERY ACTIVE IN THE PRIVACY ARENA AS WELL SO WITH THAT. IT'S BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT'S ALWAYS SO NICE I HAVE A PANEL OF THREE OUTSTANDING WOMEN. AND HI I WANTED TO GO TO GO WELL NOTE IT ALL OF YOU BEING HERE AND WE'LL START WITH A PROFESSOR DILATORY. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON THE MEMBERS OF THESE COMMITEE FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. MY NAME IS LEAH AND I THOUGHT IT AND I AM THE PRIVACY FELL LAWCENTER KINDA LAW SCHOOL. WHAT I CALL THE RACK THE PRIVACY PROGRAM AND TEACH COMPARATIVE PRIVACY LAW? I AM LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW BOTH THING IS BEING DONE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M BRIAN PRIOR TO JOINING SUN BACK DATA. I WORKED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR BOTH AS AN OUTSIDE COUNSEL. ON AS AN IN HOUSE PRIVACY ATTORNEY. I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO USE MY TIME TO PROVIDE A GENERAL OVERVIEW. OF WHAT IS THE GT B. R.. GDP ARE A STANDS. FOR GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION. AND HE'S ONE OF THE THREE LAWS THAT IMPLEMENTED THE RIGHT TO DATE THE PROTECTION IN THE E. U.. THE OTHER. TWO ARE RARELY DISCUSSED IN THE US BECAUSE THE ARE DIRECTED TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND THEREFORE. DO NOT AFFECT US ORGANIZATIONS. IN THE YOU THE RIGHT TO THE THE PROTECTION IS A FUNDAMENTAL RYAN. ENNISRIDE IN ARTICLE EIGHT OF THE CHARTER WHICH IS THE U. FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT TO THE US BILL OF RIGHTS. IN ADDITION THE CONSTITUTIONS OF SOME YOU COUNTRIES PROVIDE FOR THE RIGHT TO THE THE PROTECTION. FOR EXAMPLE ARTICLE EIGHTEEN FOR OF THE CONSTITUTION OFFICE BEING GRANTS IS FINE YOURSELF RIGHT TO THE THE PROTECTION. IN ADDITION TO HAVING A RIGHT TO THE THE PROTECTION. EUROPEANS ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY. THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS PROVIDED IS PROTECTED UNDER ARTICLE SEVEN OF THE CHARTER UNEASE RECOGNIZED BY OST IF NOT FULL MEMBERS STATE CONSTITUTIONS. THE ONLY AREA OF PRIVACY REGULATED IN THE U. LED BY THE U. LEVEL IS COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THE PRIVACY THAT ACTIVE IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON COLLECTION AXES AND USE OF COMMUNICATIONS THEY EITHER. ON MONDAY THE CERTIFIED SECURITY MEASURES. IT ALSO ESTABLISHED THE RULES OF CONSENT FOR DIRECT MARKETING UNEASE THERE. FOR THE U. COUNTERPART TO THE US CAN SPAM ACT. THE PRIVACY THAT EXIT WAS NICKNAMED THE COOKIE THAT ACTIVE BECAUSE IT IS THE REASON WHY THE SO CALLED COOKIE WALLS WERE IMPLEMENTED IN YOU WEBSITE. ONE HELPFUL ANALOGY TO UNDERSTAND THE RIGHT THE DATA PROTECTION IN EUROPE IS THIS. IN THE SAME WAY THE US CITIZENS HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS WHICH IS THE FRIEND AND THIS THING FROM. BY CONNECTED WITH THE RIGHT TO EUROPEAN SUFFERED RIGHT THE DATA PROTECTION WHICH IS DIFFERENT AND DISTINCT FROM. JACK CONNECTED WITH THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY. THE ORIGIN OF THE RIGHT TO THE TO PROTECTION CAN BE TRACEDBACK TO THE RIGHTS OF FOR THE MEDIA DATA PROCESSING IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES. AT THE TIME THE BEER CUES AND RISKS OF WHAT WE NOW CALL COMPUTERS WERE DEBATED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC. IN THE US THE CONSENSUS WAS. THE NO OVER ARCHING NEW REVELATION WAS NEEDED. EUROPEANS CAME TO THE OPPOSITE CONCLUSION AND DECIDED TO ENACT A NEW TYPE OF LOS. THESE NEW LAWS SET OUT TO REGULATE. HOW COMPUTER SAID ALLOWED TO THINK ABOUT HUMANS? THE ORIGINAL NAME GIVEN TO THESE NEW LEGAL FEEL LESS. PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARDS -- AUTOMATED PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA. THESE NAME WAS CERTAINLY TOO LONG AND WAS EVENTUALLY SHORTENED TO THE THE PROTECTION LAW. THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION TO WHICH ALL THE U. COUNTRIES WILL LONG. PLAY A KEY ROLE. IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE THE PROTECTION LAW. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE AND SEVENTY FOUR IF YOU SHOULD TO INFERENTIAL RESOLUTIONS THE LAID DOWN THE THE THE PROTECTION PROCESSING PRINCIPLES. EMBEDDED TO THE IN GDP ARE ON JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH OF NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE THE COUNCIL OPENED FOR SIGNATURE. THE CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH REGARD TO AUTOMATED PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA. NO NUYS CONVENTION ONE AWAIT. THIS CONVENTION IS THE SEED FROM WHICH THE RIGHT TO THE THE PROTECTION IS PROUD DID A NEW REMAINS TO THIS DAY THE ONLY INTERNATIONAL BINDING AGREEMENT. IN THE FIELD OF THE THE PROTECTION LAW. INCIDENTALLY IT IS ALSO THE REASON WHY EUROPEAN CELEBRATE THE THE PROTECTION THE ANNUALLY ON JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH. THE FIRST PAN EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION LAW WAS ENACTED IN. NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL HE WAS THEIR GATED BY GDP ARE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN IS FRAMEWORK WAS BUILDING FOR COURT TENANTS. THAT HAVE PROVEN STRONG ENOUGH TO THE REF EFFECTIVE COMPLIANCE YET FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ADAPT TO THE EVER CHANGING NATURE OF TECHNOLOGY. THIS TENANTS WERE NOT CHANGED BY GDP ARE. I WILL BRIEFLY DISCUSS THEM I KNOW FOR CORRELATIONS TO CC BE ABLE. THEIR FIRST AND THEN IS THAT TECHNOLOGY MUST BE BUILT TO SERVE HUMANKIND. IN THE WORST OF APPLE CEO BIG NO NO HE'S CAPABLE OF DOING GREAT THINGS. BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO GREAT THINGS. IT DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING. THAT PART SIX ALL OF US. THE OVER ARCHING GOAL OF THE THE PROTECTION LAW AS DESCRIBED IN RECITAL FOR OF GDP ARE. USED TO ENSURE THAT TECHNOLOGY IS ASSIGNED TO SERVE MANKIND. TO PREVENT AN ETHICAL USES OF TECHNOLOGY THAT THE PROTECTION DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PERMISSIBLE. I NON PERMISSIBLE PURPOSES. YOU'LL DATA PROTECTION LAW. IDENTIFY SIX CATEGORIES OF FOR PURPOSES COLO FOOD BASES. THAT CONSTITUTE THE UNIVERSE OF WHAT IS PERMISSIBLE AND I'LL CLOSE THE USE OF THE UTILIZED PERSONAL DATA FOR ANY PURPOSE IS THE FULL OUTSIDE. OF THOSE SIX CATEGORIES. IT COULD BE SAID. THAT THE GENERAL RULE UNDER GPR IS THAT YOUR WHO THEN CALLED GUILTY OF UNLAWFUL PROCESSING UNTIL YOU CAN PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE BY IDENTIFYING A LAWFUL BASE. PERHAPS THE HISTORY OF EUROPE IS THIS PLEASE THESE RESTRICTIVE APPROACH. ALTHOUGH THE POTENTIAL FOR GOOD THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES WHO REALLY DID NOT ESCAPE EUROPEAN LAWMAKERS. THE QUESTION OF HOW THE HOLOCAUST WILL HAVE LUKE IF A DATABASE CAPABLE OF TRACKING THEIR WHEREABOUTS AND RELIGION A FULL EUROPEAN CITIZENS ASSISTED AT THE TIME. WAS LIKELY NOT FAR FROM THEIR MINDS EITHER. FIFTY FIFTY EIGHT DOES NOT ADOPTED GTRS RESTRICTIVE GENERAL RULE. BUT THE DUSTING COOPERATE THE IDEA OF SPECIFICALLY THE CPA SUBJECTS THE SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES WAS THE CPA GOALS COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. WHAT I TO OPT OUT FOR THOSE I TRY TO OF THE IN FOR MINORS? IN CONTRAST TO THE GT B. R. WHICH DOES NOT DEFINE THE CONDO THAT THE THREE ST STE THE CITY PA DEFIES THE CONDUCT. OF THE TO SELL THAT THE THE RESTRICT. THE SECOND TENANT. ISTHAT FACTUAL CONTROL SHOULD EQUAL ACCOUNTABILITY. UNDER YOU THE THE PROTECTION LAW ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE TO HANDLING IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO FACTUAL CONTROL. ANY ENTITY THAT ALONE ARE JOINING WITH OTHERS THAT THE ROOMS THE PURPOSES SOME MEANS OF THE PROCESSING OF PERSONALITY DAYS QUINCY THERE ARE CONTROL -- INDEED THE SET ACT ON BEHALF OF CONTROLLERS ARE CONSIDER PROCES SOURCE. BECAUSE EUROPEAN CD THE PROTECTION A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT VERY FEW ORGANIZATIONS ARE EXEMPTED FROM G. B. R.. BY LIMITING THE EXCEPTIONS AND HE QUIT THE ARMY WAITING CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY. GDP ARE EFFECTIVELY TODAY'S A NUMBER A COUPLE CHAIN OF CUSTODY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA. FIFTY BE A PRICE CONTROL TO ACCOUNTABILITY BY INCORPORATING THE CONCEPT OF CONTROLLER TO IS THE PHOENICIAN OF BUSINESS. ON THE CONCEPT OF PROCESSOR TO ITS DEFINITION OF SERVICE PROVIDER. HOWEVER THE CPA ONLY APPLIES TO ENTITIES THAT MEET CERTAIN THRESHOLDS. WHICH IN PRACTICE MEANS THAT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THE PROCESS. OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THIS THE CPA. THEREFORE IT COULD BE SAID THAT THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY OVER DATA AND THEIR CCPA CAN BE INTERRUPTED. BACK. WHO'S THE CPA QUITS CONTROL TO ACCOUNTABILITY CHAIN WILL NOT BREAK. AS THE THE CHANGES HANDS WHENEVER AN ENTITY THAT MEANS THE CITY BE A THRESHOLD THAT FORCE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OVER. THEIR DATA MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND THOSE OF THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE CPA. FOR EXAMPLE OF THE THE BROKER THAT MEANS THE THRESHOLDS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO SEE CPA EVEN IF IT THIS GREW SIMPLY COLLECTS DATA FROM SOURCES THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SEE TO BE A A HAS NO DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INDIVIDUALS TO HOME DID THE THAT RELATES. THE THIRD TENANTS OF THE THE PROTECTION KNOWING YOUR OF IS THE ACTED YOU FOR REGULATORS WHICH SHE'S. IF YOU YOU CAN CONNECT THEN WE WILL REGULATED. THE LINE BETWEEN PRIVATE AND SENSITIVE AND PUBLIC A HARMLESS IS VERY TO THE THEN THE LOGICAL ADVANCES ENABLE THE IDENTIFICATION OF INDIVIDUALS BASED ON THE THAT THAT. AT FIRST GLANCE. SEEMS RANDOM I MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO THAT I'VE SENSITIVE INFORMATION FROM RELATIVELY MUNDANE DATASETS. FOR EXAMPLE RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND 95% OF CELL PHONE USERS. CAN BE UNIQUELY IDENTIFIED BY USING ONLY FORTY SPATIOTEMPORAL POINTS. THE OC THOSE ARE FOUR POINTS IDENTIFYING THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY WHAT ABOUT AN APPROXIMATE TIME. AND THESE FLUIDITY HASLAM STRONG LEGAL FRAMERS THE LIMIT THEIR SCOPE. TO THE DEAD AT THE SCENE CURRENTLY PRIVATE OR SENSITIVE. YOU MEAN THE THE PROTECTION LAWS RESTRICTED THE RESTRICTS THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND DEFINES THE TERM TO MEAN. INFORMATION RELATING TO AND IDENTIFY PERSON. THESE THE PHOENICIAN IS RATHER SHORT. BUT IS THIS GOAL AS INTERPRETED BY EUROPEAN COURTS AND DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES IS EXTREMELY BROWN. INFORMATION NEED NOT BE PRIVATE OR CONFIDENTIAL TO BE SUBJECT TO THE G. THE PR. IN FACT SOME OF THE MOST PUBLIC THINGS ABOUT US. INCLUDING OUR NAME ARE ALSO UNQUESTIONABLY PERSONAL. PROOF OF A SPECIAL INTERESTS TO BE BANNED DISSEMINATION ARMIES UC'S NOT NEEDED. AND ESTABLISHING A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY IS NOT REQUIRED. THEREFORE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA IS SUBJECT TO GDP ARE SO LONG I SEE THESE PERSONAL IN NATURE. IN THE SAME WAY INFORMATION NEED NOT BE SENSITIVE TO BE SUBJECT TO GDP ARE. ARTICLE NINE OF THE GDP ARE PLACES ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE PROCESSING OF INFORMATION THAT HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN A VECTOR. FOR DISCRIMINATION SUCH AS RACE. RELIGION POLITICAL AFFILIATION OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THE CIRCLE SPECIAL CATEGORIES. HOWEVER THERE IS NO MINIMUM THRESHOLD OF SENSITIVITY. BELOW WHICH YOU THE P. R. THAT'S NOT APPLY. THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION UNDER CC BA IS MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN ANY EXISTING DEFINITION UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. THESE DEFINITION INCLUDES IN ITS THE SCOPE THE THE ELEMENTS THAT ENOUGH THEMSELVES ARE NEITHER PRIVATE NOR SENSITIVE. SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT CCPA WOULD REGULATE THAT THAT DATE ANOTHER REGULATED UNDER GPR. I PERSONALLY CANNOT IMAGINE HOW AN INTERPRETATION OF CCPA COULD RESULT IN THAT OUTCOME. SPECIALLY WHEN CBS GROUP STATE ANOTHER SCREW THE FRIEND YOU THE PR SUCH AS ANONYMIZED. ON AGGREGATED THE THEM. THE FOURTH TEN AND OF THE THE PROTECTION LAW IS THE TRANSPARENCY IS THE ONLY PASSED THE FAIRNESS. A KEY GOAL OF THE THE PROTECTION LAW HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO ENHANCE THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE THE PROCESSING. TRANSPARENCY SEEN AS A PREREQUISITE FOR FAIRNESS BECAUSE IN MANY WAYS. COMPLIANCE WITH THE THE PROTECTION ALWAYS. FROM GRANTING THE WHEELS ARE RIGHT TO BE INFORMED. I NEVER RIGHT TO ACCESS. TO REQUIRE INTEGRATION IMPLEMENTATION OF DATA MANAGEMENT POLICIES IMPORTANT RECORDKEEPING OBLIGATIONS MONDAY THEN THE APPOINTMENT OF THE THE PROTECTION OFFICERS. ON ENABLING UPGRADE WITH RIDE THE FACTION. MANY PROVISIONS IN GDP ARE ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY. THIS IS CPA GOES FARTHER THAN ANY EXISTING US FEDERAL OR STATE LOW BY INCLUDING TRANSPARENCY ENHANCING PROVISIONS. AND MOST NOTABLY IT GIVES CALIFORNIANS OF RIGHT TO ACCESS THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. HOWEVER. IT DOES NOT GO AS FAR AS THE GDP ARE. THAT'S THE FINAL POINT. IN MY EXPERIENCE THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA REQUIRES THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AND WOOD TRAINED PROFESSIONALS TO MANAGE. THE MANAGERIAL POSITIONS ON A SCHEME THAT EFFECTIVELY PROTECTS THEM INDEED REYES EASES INTERNALLY. MISSISSIPPI THAT'S ANOTHER SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED APPOINTMENT OF INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLIANCE. I'M CALIFORNIA LOSS TO THE FOR NO MEANINGFUL PROTECTIONS TO PRIVACY PROFESSIONALS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE OFTEN FUNCTION ASSEMBLY THE REGULATORY ENFORCERS. AND NOT ALWAYS IN FRIENDLY TERRITORY. IT IS MY BELIEVE THAT EMPOWER ENOUGH PROTECTING PRIVACY PROFESSIONALS WILL GO A LONG WAY. TO WAS INSURING EFFECTIVE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS IN CONCLUSION. IN ADDITION TO HAVING THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY EUROPEAN SUFFER RIGHT TO THE TO PROTECTION THE GDP ARE IS ONE OF THE THREE THE THE PROTECTION LAWS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. IT'S A STATE THAT THE GOAL IS TO ENSURE TECHNOLOGIES BILL TO SERVE MANKIND AND TO THE SAY AND IT ALLOWS THE USE OF PERSONAL OF THE THE ONLY FOR PURPOSES THE ETHICAL. GREETS UNBREAKABLE CHAIN OF CUSTODY OVER THE THE BY EQUATING ACCOUNTABILITY TO FACTUAL CONTROL. AND INCLUDES MANY TRANSPARENCY ENHANCING PROVISIONS. THIS IS THE BE A REPRESENTS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO ENFORCING PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT MODELED AFTER THE GDP ARE. IT DOESN'T COOPERATE IN TWO WEEKS MAY KIND COMPLIANCE STRUCTURE OF EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION LAW SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY FIVE I AGAIN WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN FORTY SO PATERNITY TO PARTICIPATE. AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND NOW WE WILL ASK -- JESSICA LEAD. TO TALK TO US ABOUT SOME OF THE WORK ABILITY ISSUES CLEARLY THE TWO SYSTEMS ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT -- SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER GDP ARE ARE MORE STRINGENT -- BUT FOCUSING ON HOW DOES ONE GO ABOUT -- ADVISING CLIENTS ABOUT CCPA ARE THERE THINGS. THAT WE COULD. CLARIFY OR THE THINGS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THAT ADVICE TO CLIENTS JUST. HOW AS A PRACTITIONER DO YOU GO ABOUT ADVISE YOUR COMMENTS ON HOW TO COMPLY? OR AND I'M GOING TO READ MY PREPARED STATEMENT I WILL SAY I HAVE A I HAVE A LIST. I WON'T GET THROUGH EVERYTHING IN THE FIFTEEN MINUTES BUT I'LL COVER THE HIGHLIGHTS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND IF YOU COULD MOVE THAT CLOSER TO YOU SO THAT WE CAN [inaudible] ALL. BE ABLE TO PAY ATTENTION THANK YOU YEAH. SOME TEAR JACKSON COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JESSICA LEE I CO CHAIR THE PRIVACY SECURITY INDEED INNOVATIONS PRACTICE GROUP AT LOGAN LOBE. IN THIS CAPACITY ADVISE CLIENTS ACROSS ON A COMPLIANCE ACROSS THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY REGULATIONS INCLUDING WITH THE IS GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION AND MORE RECENTLY THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. I BRASS TO SPEAK ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE HELPING CLIENTS PREPARE FOR THE G. P. ARE. THE STEPS NEEDED -- TO TAKE TO ADDRESS THE CCPA APPS AND WHERE THEIR OVERLAPS L. AND BY OFFERING SOME SUGGESTIONS OF CLARIFICATIONS TO THE CZ PA A TO HELP GUIDE COMPLIANCE AND BETTER ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THIS LAW. PLEASE NOTE THAT MY COMMENTS REPRESENT MY OWN VIEWS AND MY OBSERVATIONS AND I'M NOT SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF ANY CLIENT OF LOGAN LOW. THE BEFORE BEGIN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO QUICKLY HIGHLIGHTS THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REGULATION IN THE US AND REGULATION IO. THE G. P. R. AND THE PRIVACY DIRECTIVE THAT PRECEDED IT ATTEMPTS TO CODIFY A BASELINE OF PRINCIPLES DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF INDIVIDUALS. AS THEY RELATE TO THE USE OF THEIR PERSONAL DATA. THE G. P. R. DOESN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW TO MEET ITS GOALS ALTHOUGH PROVIDE SOME DETAILS WITH RESPECT TO ITS EXPECTATIONS. INSTEAD OF PLACES A BURDEN ON COMPANIES TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR OWN PRACTICES. WELL GUIDANCE AND ENFORCEMENT PROVIDE SOME CLARITY THE REGULATION ITSELF HAS MANY GRAY AREAS AND ROOM FOR INTERPRETATION. COUNTING CLIENTS PARTICULARLY US BASED COMPANIES A COMPLIANCE WITH THIS LAW IS A CHALLENGE. IN THE US OUR LAWS ARE VERY PRESCRIPTIVE WE DON'T JUST TELL YOU WHAT TO DO -- HOPING I WOULD TELL YOU WE DICTATED T. WE TEND TO BE VERY SPECIFIC. AND THEIR PLUSES AND MINUSES WITH THIS APPROACH. IN THE PLUS COLUMN IT GIVES CLARITY TO BUSINESS THEY CAN SAY THEY HAVE CHECKED THE BOXES THEY ARE COMPLIANT AND THEY CAN MOVE ON WITH PERIODIC COMPLIANCE AUDITS. IN THE MINUS COLUMN IT MEANS THAT SOME U. S. LAWS MAY BE OVER BROUGHT IN SOME CASES OR REJECT. I WAS THE LAW IN THE US HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN SECTOR SPECIFIC. WE HAVE LOST TO ADDRESS HEALTH DATA FINANCIAL DATA AND CHILDREN'S DATA AS EXAMPLES. AND DRAFTING PRESCRIPTIVE LAWS AND SUCH NARROWLY TAILORED CONTACTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO GIVE RISE TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THE US IS NOT HOWEVER HAD A GENERAL PRIVACY LAW THAT APPLIED ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES IN PART BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT TO CRAFT A REGULATION THAT IS BOTH SPECIFIC AND THEN OPERATIONALLY MANAGEABLE. ACROSS MULTIPLE INDUSTRIES AND COMPANIES OF VARYING SIZE AND RESOURCES. THE GPR ALTHOUGH FRUSTRATING FOR THOSE USED TO HAVING A VERY SPECIFIC ROADMAP TO COMPLIANCE ALLOWED COMPANIES FLEXIBILITY TO CREATE THEIR OWN ROADMAP WITHIN THE PARAMETERS SET OUT BY REGULATORS. BY EXAMINING THEIR DATA USE PRACTICES AND THEN TAILING A COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AND A MATTER THAT BALANCE THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES WITH THEIR PRIVACY OBLIGATIONS. THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT COMPANIES WERE JUST LEFT TO THEIR PASSED -- AND THE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS MAKE THAT CLEAR BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT STRONG PRIVACY PROTECTION AND REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY CAN GO HAND IN HAND. SO SPEAK TO A DUTY COMPLIANCE LOOKS LIKE IN PRACTICE. A GPR COMPLIANCE PROGRAM CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS HAVING THREE KEY PHASES BEGINNING WITH DISCOVERY. IN THE DISCOVERY PHASE COMPANIES TAKE STOCK OF THEIR CURRENT PRACTICES THEY WORK WITH INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS OFTEN EXTERNAL VENDORS AND COMPANIES TAKE INVENTORY OF THE DATA THEY COLLECT THE SOURCE OF THE DATA. HOW THE DATA IS USED TO IT SHARED WITH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY WHERE IT'S STORED AND THEN WHAT SECURITY PATROLS ARE APPLIED? THIS INVOLVES AND PUT FROM EVERYONE FROM THE BUSINESS TO I. T. IN LEGAL. AT SOME POINT UNDERSTAND IT FOR MANY COMPANIES DATA STORED IN UNSTRUCTURED FORMATS ACROSS MULTIPLE DATABASES WITH A VARIETY OF OWNERS. ORGANIZING THIS INFORMATION ACROSS THE COMPANY NO BOTH FOR LARGE COMPANIES WITH COMPLICATED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES AND FOR SMALL COMPANIES AS WELL IS A COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING EFFORT. NEXT ONE THE COMPANY UNDERSTANDS OUR DATA LANDSCAPE IT CONDUCTS A GAP ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE GAPS BETWEEN THEIR PRACTICES AND THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. AND I'LL GIVE YOU A FEW KEY QUESTIONS THAT A COMPANY WILL ASK ITSELF DURING THIS PHASE. THE FIRST WHAT'S -- AND THIS IS FOR GPR WHAT IS A LAWFUL BASIS WILL RELY ON FOR ITS PROCESSING ACTIVITIES. THE G. P. R. REQUIRES A COMPANY TO HAVE A LAWFUL BASIS FOR PROCESSING DATA AND THERE ARE SIX OPTIONS INCLUDING CONSENT AND LEGITIMATE INTEREST ACTUALLY ISN'T AN NOTICE AND CONSENT REGIME YOU GOT YOU HAVE TO GET CONSENT TO DROP A COOKIE UNDER THE PRIVACY DIRECTIVE. BUT FOR G. P. R. PURPOSES ARE SIX BASIS THAT'S OUR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL PERSONAL DATA. AND CONSENT A LEGITIMATE INTEREST OUR MOST POPULAR FOR BUSINESSES AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN REQUIREMENTS AND CONSEQUENCES. FOR A COMPANY IS RELYING ON CONSENT IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND IF THAT MEANS THE G. P. R.'S STANDARDS IS IT SPECIFIC IS AN UNAMBIGUOUS IS IT FREELY GIVEN ME THAT THERE'S A CHA AN ACTUAL REAL CHOICE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU GIVE CONSENT. THE WATER COMPANY RELIES ON LEGITIMATE INTERESTS THE COMPANY CONDUCTS A THREE PART ANALYSIS IDENTIFYING WITH THEIR INTEREST IS LEGITIMATE MEANING IS IT LAWFUL. AND THEN WHETHER THEIR USE OF DATA IS NECESSARY IN PROPORTIONAL TO THE PURPOSE. AND FINALLY WHETHER THE RISK TO THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL ARE SO HIGH THAT THEY MIGHT OUTWEIGH THE INTEREST OF THE BUSINESS. A COMPANY WILL ALSO ASK IF IT'S I'D ENGAGING IN ANY HIGH RISK PROCESSING ACTIVITIES TO THE G. P. R. REQUIRES A DATA PROTECTION IMPACT ASSESSMENT FOR ANY HIGH RISK PROCESSING ACTIVITIES. THAT CAN BE ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE THE COLLECTION OF SENSE OF PERSONAL DATA CAN BE PROCESSING ON A LARGE SCALE OR AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING THAT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OR A LEGAL A FACT. THAT COULD BE CREDIT REPORTS THAT COULD BE HOUSING DETERMINATIONS EMPLOYMENT DETERMINATIONS AND THE LIKE. COMPANIES CONDUCT THESE ASSESSMENTS THE ADJUSTER DATA PROCESSING ACTIVITIES TO REDUCE THE RISK TO INDIVIDUALS AND A DOCUMENT THEIR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS. AGAIN THESE REQUIRE A THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS AND COMPANY ULTIMATELY HAS TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY THE CONCLUSION THAT IT REACHES. THEN FINALLY THE COMPANY IDENTIFIES GAPS IN THEIR INTERNAL PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THE COMPANY THE SIZE OF THEIR PRACTICES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE GDP OURS APARTMENTS. THE THIRD PHASE OF A GPR COMPLIANCE PROGRAM IS REMEDIATION AND IMPLEMENTATION. THIS IS ONE COMPANIES ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE CHANGESREQUIRED TO ADDRESS THE GAPS OF IDENTIFIED. NO -- CLOTHING IMPLEMENTING A PROCESS TO RESPOND TO THOSE DATA SUBJECT REQUEST. THIS IS REALLY WHERE THE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM SHE ORIGINAL. IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO RAISE A CONSUMERS DATA. BUT IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY RESPOND TO INTERRACIAL REQUEST YOU NEED A MECHANISM TO VERIFY THE CONSUMER. NEED TO KNOW WHERE THE DATA STORED WHETHER YOU HAVE AN OVERRIDING NEED TO RETAIN THE DATA AND THE TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO RESPONDING COMPLY WITHIN A THIRTY DAY PERIOD. A FEW OTHER TASKS HAPPENED DURING THIS PHASE ME IMPLEMENT NEW DATA SECURITY PROTOCOLS THERE'S A REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN A A DATA INVENTORY THAT HAS TO BE CONTINUALLY UPDATED. YOU NEED TO TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES AN UPDATE YOUR EXTERNAL PRIVACY POLICIES IN YOUR CONSUMER FACING LANGUAGE. COMPANIES ALSO NEED TO UPDATE THEIR THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS AND TEMPLATE THE GPR REQUIRES COMPANIES TO CONTROL THE USE OF DATA TO PLAY CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS ON THE COMPANIES THAT PROCESS DATA ON THEIR BEHALF. AND A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME IS ACTUALLY SPENT GOING TO THOSE NEGOTIATIONS ARE REAL COMMERCIAL IMPLICATIONS THERE. IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND ALSO THE GT R. COMPLIANCE IS NOT A FINITE PROJECT SO WHILE MAY TWENTY FIFTH WAS CHARACTERIZED THE DEADLINE. IT WASN'T REALLY A DEADLINE IT WAS JUST A MARKER OF TIME IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE GDP ARE ULTIMATELY IS AN ONGOING EFFORT. ASSESSMENTS CONDUCTED LAST YEAR MAYBE OUT OF DATE FOR SOME RECORDS ARE PROCESSING HAVE TO BE CONTINUALLY UPDATED AND RISKS NEED TO BE CONTINUALLY A FAST. THOSE IMPORTANT BUT THE G. P. R. FOR MANY COMPANIES APART A SHIFT IN THEIR BUSINESS CULTURE. THESE REGULATIONS ARE MORE THAN JUST A POLICY OR PRACTICE CHANGE FOR COMPANIES THAT AREN'T DATA FIRST COMPANIES HE'S REQUIRE HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE SHIPS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE COMPLIANCE EFFORT. THE NOW TURN TO THE C. CPI. KEEP IN MIND THAT THE CCPA AND THE G. P. R. TAKE A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION. THE WHILE THE GPRS FOCUS ON ALL PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA REQUIRES THAT LAWFUL BASIS FOR PROCESSING ACTIVITIES. WITH THE CPA IS FOCUSED ON THE COLLECTION AND TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA. THE H. GIVE INDIVIDUAL CERTAIN RIGHTS OVER THE USE OF PERSONAL DATA BUT THEY APPROACH THOSE RIGHTS DIFFERENTLY. THE COMPANIES WERE NOT SUBJECT TO THE G. P. ARE ONLY TO START FROM SCRATCH GOING TO THAT THREE PHASE PROCESS I JUST DESCRIBED. IF A COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED A GPR GRAHAM IT'LL BE IN A STRONGER POSITION TO BUILD A CCPA COMPLIANCE PROGRAM. BUT EVEN THOSE COMPANIES TO UPDATE THEIR PRACTICES TO COMPLY WITH THE GDP ARE THE STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY THAT IS SO THE G. P. ARE SMALLER COMPANIES WITH FEWER RESOURCES MAY BE AT A SIGNIFICANT DISADVANTAGE AS THEY WORK TO MEET. THESE NEW OBLIGATIONS THE CHALLENGE FOR THESE COMPANIES IS THAT THEY WILL NOT BE AFFORDED THE SAME FLEXIBILITY THEY MAY HAVE BEEN GIVEN -- UNDER THE GPR. SO IN TERMS OF WHAT CCPA COMPLIANCE TO ACQUIRE. AGAIN WE'LL START WITH THE DATA INVENTORY AND MAPPING PROCESS COMPANIES TO PREPARE FOR THE G. D. P. R. CAN LEVERAGE THE WORK POTENTIALLY THAT THEY DID. HOWEVER MANY COMPANIES LIMIT THEIR EFFORTS TO THE E. U. FACING PORTIONS OF THEIR BUSINESS. EVEN IF COMPANIES ENGAGED AN ENTERPRISE WIDE ASSESSMENT THE QUESTIONS THE COMPANY WILL NEED TO ASK ITSELF THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE ASKED GOING TO THE G. P. R. PROCESS. THE COMPANIES NEED TO UNDERSTAND FIRST IF THEY COLLECT INFORMATION FROM CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. THE GT PR IN CONTRAST HAS NO RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS THE GRANTS PROTECTION TO ANY INDIVIDUAL LOCATED IN THE EGO. AND IT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE TO IDENTIFIES PUBLICLY ONLINE DATA WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE'S IN THE E. U. BASED ON AN I. P. ADDRESS. BUT I. P. ADDRESSES ARE PROXY FOR YOUR PHYSICAL LOCATION NOT FOR YOUR RESIDENCY. SO FOR COMPANIES WHO DON'T SEND DIRECT MAIL FOR EXAMPLE OR IF YOU DON'T DELIVER PRODUCTS TO SOMEONE'S HOME ME ONLY HAVE AN EMAIL ADDRESS OR AN I. P. ADDRESS AND THAT WON'T CONVEY ANY INFORMATION ABOUT RESIDENCY. A COMPANY MAY IRONICALLY NEED TO COLLECT MORE INFORMATION TO TO THE MAILING ADDRESS TO DETERMINE WHERE A CONSUMER RESIDES. COMPANIES ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND IF THE LAW APPLIES TO THEM AND WHAT. THE G. P. R. AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER DIVIDE WORLD INTO CONTROLLERS AND THE PROCESSORS AND ALLOCATE RESPONSIBILITY BASED ON THE COMPANY'S ROLE. CONTROLLER UNDER GPR WOULD BE THE BUSINESS UNDER CC PA. A PROCESSOR UNDER GPR WOULD BE THE SERVICE PROVIDER UNDER THE CPA. HOWEVER THE CCPA IS NOT AS CLEAR ABOUT THE OBLIGATIONS OF A SERVICE PROVIDER. DO WHAT TO MAYBE JUST A MISSING COMMA FROM SECTION SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT ONE FORTY SEE ONE A VENDOR COULD BE DEEMED A BUSINESS UNDER THE LAW MERELY BECAUSE IT COLLECTS CONSUMERS PERSONAL INFORMATION. EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY DOING SO ON BEHALF OF THE BUSINESS. THIS IS THE POINT THAT COULD BE CLARIFIED TO COMPANIES CAN UNDERSTAND THE ROLES AND UNDERSTAND WHAT OBLIGATIONS MIGHT APPLY TO THEM. THE INVENTORY PROCESS IS ALSO IMPACTED BY THE DIFFERENCES IN THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. BOTH THE CZ P. A. AND THE G. P. R. FOR THE CONCEPT THAT DATA IS PERSONAL MONEY CAN BE USED TO EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IDENTIFY A PERSON. BUT THE C. CPA -- EXPAND THAT DEFINITION TO INCLUDE HOUSEHOLD INFORMATION AND INFORMATION THAT IS CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATE WITH AN INDIVIDUAL WHICH ULTIMATELY COULD BE ANYTHING. UNDERSTANDING WHAT CONSTITUTES PERSONAL INFORMATION IS ONE OF THE COMPLIANCE CHALLENGES THE COMPANIES ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW. AND FINALLY COMPANIES NEED TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE SELLING PERSONAL DATA AS DEFINED BY THE CPA. AND I KNOW -- MANY OF YOU RECEIVED AND AT YOUR FULL ON THE BROAD DEFINITION OF SALES I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THAT. BUT I WILL SAY THAT COMPLY WITH THE OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION REQUIRES A COMPANY TO UNDERSTAND NOT ONLY WHETHER THEY ARE SELLING BUT THE ALSO NEED TO DETERMINE THE VALUE TO THEM OF THE DATA BEING SOLD I THINK IS A THREAT RIGHT NOW IT'S A VALUE. TO THE CONSUMER BUT THAT APPEARS TO THERE MAY NOT BE A CLEAR METRIC FOR THIS VALUATION. COMPANIES ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF OPTING OUT BOTH ON THE BUSINESS AND THE CONSUMER AND WHETHER THE IMPACT ON THE CONSUMER WOULD BE DEEMED DISCRIMINATION. THESE ARE NOT ONLY LEGAL DECISIONS THEY ARE BUSINESS DECISIONS AND THEY MAY REQUIRE COMPANIES TO REEVALUATE AND CHANGE OUR BUSINESS MODELS. YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE PRESENTED FOR COMPANIES WITH LOYALTY AND MEMBERSHIP BASED PROGRAMS. ONCE THE COMPANY COMPLETED TO MAPPING AND ASSESSMENT PHASE IT'LL NEED TO TURN TO IMPLEMENTATION. FOR CCPA THIS A LARGELY BE FOCUSED ON HOW TO PROVIDE A RESPOND TO THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. AND WHILE THE C. C. P. A. N. G. P. R. OFFER A SIMILAR SET OF RATES THE CZ PA IS MORE PRESCRIPTIVE AND HOW THOSE RATES ARE DELIVERED. RESPOND UP FOCUS MY TIME ON TO FOR THE RIGHT OF ACCESS SO THE LAWS ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR WHEN IT COMES TO THE RIGHT OF ACCESS -- BUT THE PROCEDURE IS DIFFERENT. THE WHILE THE GPR REQUIRES A CONTROLLERS BROUGHT TO PROVIDE AN EASILY ACCESSIBLE MECHANISM TO SUBMIT DATA SUBJECT REQUEST. THE CCPA TELLS US EXACTLY WHAT THAT MECHANISM SHOULD BE AND THAT INCLUDES PROVIDING EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER. AND WHILE THIS NUMBER ITSELF IS FAIRLY EASY TO OBTAIN STAFFING AND TRAINING TELEPHONE OPERATORS TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS. REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THIS IS ALSO A CHALLENGE FOR COMPANIES WHO JUST INTERACT WITH THEIR CONSUMERS ONLINE. AND THEY ALSO PRESENT REST IN TERMS OF VERIFICATION. WITH RESPECT TO OPT OUT BOTH THE C. C. P. A. N. G. P. R. PROVIDE A RIGHT FOR INDIVIDUALS TO RESTRICT TELL COMPANY USES OUR DATA IN CERTAIN CASES. THE WHILE THE GPR DOES NOT SPECIFY HOW THIS OPT OUT IS MADE AVAILABLE THE CPA SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES A LINK TO DO NOT SOME INFORMATION ON THE HOME PAGE OF THE BUSINESS. WHICH AS DEFINED COULD BE EVERY SINGLE PAYER SO USING LANGUAGE THAT COULD BE MISUNDERSTOOD OR MISINTERPRETED BY THE AVERAGE CONSUMER. I THINK ONE OF THE KEY COMPLIANCE CHALLENGES FACED BY COMPANIES IS THAT THERE ARE SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT AND THE CLOCK IS TICKING. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY EXPECTATION THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENTS OF THIS LAW ARE GOING TO SIGNIFICANTLY HANGE BUT WE DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY'LL BE RULE MAKING FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THERE WILL LIKELY BE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS. AND THAT MIGHT IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONALIZE THESE REQUIREMENTS YOU KNOW TAKE FOR EXAMPLE IF A COMPANY SPENDS RESOURCES NOW CREATING A CONSUMER RIGHT VERIFICATION PROGRAM. THE RULE MAKING IS ISSUED NEXT YEAR IT'S CONTRARY TO ITS PLAN IT MAY NOT HAVE TIME TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIRED CHANGES. ONCE A G. P. R. PASSED BUSINESSES HAD TWO YEARS TO COME TO PREPARE THEIR COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS. AND WHILE THE VENN ARTICLE TWENTY NINE WORKING PARTY ISSUED GUIDANCETO HELP PROVIDE CLARITY ON SOME OF THE GRAY AREAS. IT WAS JUST THAT IT WAS RULE MAKING THAT COULD REQUIRE. UPS GETTING OUT IT WAS JUST THAT IT WAS IT WAS ITS GUIDANCE I DURING THE TO YOUR RAMP UP THERE WAS NO ADDITIONAL CHANGES IN THE LAW ITSELF OR RULE MAKING THAT COULD REQUIRE CHANGING DIRECTION AT THE LAST MINUTE. FOR ALL COMPANIES THAT ADVISOR STARTING THE MAPPING PROCESS NOW THE AND ACTUALLY NEED TO BEGIN OPERATIONALIZE IN FAIRLY QUICKLY IN ORDER TO MEET THE TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE. SO SPEND MY REMAINING TIME DISCUSSING A FEW MODIFICATIONS TO THE C. CPA THAT COULD CLARIFY SOME THE COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS AND REDUCE THE RISK OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THE COMPANIES ADVISE RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR THE PARTIES PROTECTIONS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. THERE JUST STRUGGLING WITH HOW. SO FIRST OF ALL IT'S RECEIVED IN A LOT OF ATTENTION WAS MENTIONED EARLIER I DO WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE DESIRE FOR CLARITY AROUND THE INCLUSION OF HOUSEHOLD IN THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. THE WAY THAT IT'S INCORPORATED NOW CREATES A REAL RISK THAT DATA COULD END UP IN THE HANDS OF THE WRONG INDIVIDUAL. THERE APPEARS TO BE NOTHING IN THE STATUTE PREVENTING A ROOMMATE FOR EXAMPLE FROM EXERCISING A DELETION REQUEST JUST AS A PRANK. A LESSON OCULUS LEE AND ESTRANGED HUSBAND COULD EXERCISE A DATA REQUEST AND GET INFORMATION ABOUT HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN. A LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENT TO REMOVE THE REFERENCE TO HOUSEHOLD AND THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COULD PREVENT SOME OF THESE ON WARRANTED DATA DSCLOSURES WITHOUT WATERING DOWN THE LAW BECAUSE THE DEFINITIONS ARE A VERY BROAD. ALTERNATIVELY AND NOW OUR SOLUTION COULD BE TO AMEND THE LAW TO SPECIFY THAT THERE'S NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THE CONSUMER WITH THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL. EVEN IF THAT OTHER INDIVIDUAL IS A MEMBER EITHER APPROACH WOULD HELP INSURE BUSINESSES ARE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPLY WITH THIS LAW. SECOND MIGHT CONSIDER INTRODUCING THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE CODES OF CONDUCT -- THIS IS REFLECTED IN ARTICLE FORTY FOUR I BELIEVE OF THE GPR. AS I MENTIONED THE TOP OF MY REMARKS CREATING A PRIVACY LAW THAT APPLIES ACROSS MULTIPLE INDUSTRIES AND BUSINESSES OF VARYING SIZES IS A CHALLENGE. CODE OF CONDUCT WHICH OULD BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OR ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WOULD ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL CLARITY THAT WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SPECIFIC FEATURES OF CERTAIN SECTORS. AND THE NEED TO SMALLER COMPANIES. FINALLY THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT THE TWELVE MONTH LOOK BACK PERIOD AND WHAT EXACTLY IT WILL BEGIN. BUSINESSES NEED TIME TO MAP AN ORGANIZER DATA I SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT THE FACT THAT. IT COULD BE AN MULTIPLE DATABASES VERY UNSTRUCTURED IT'S IT'S A PROCESS TO KIND OF BRING THE STATE INTO A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN EFFECTIVELY ON OF THESE THESE DATA SUBJECT REQUEST IT'S NOT THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE. BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT TAKES TIME. AND SO WILL MAKE IN THAT COULD PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION THAT OF THE RULES ARE PUBLISHED UNTIL NEXT YEAR THAT REALLY LEAVES VERY LITTLE TIME TO MAP AN ORGANIZED AT THAT -- DATA ACCORDING TO THE FINAL DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AGAIN WHICH MIGHT TAINT CHANGE ACCORDING TO RULE MAKING. SO AN AMENDMENT THAT CLARIFIES THAT TOLD MONTH LOOK BACK PERIOD WILL NOT BE AGAIN TO THE PUBLICATION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S FINAL RULES OR AT LEAST ALLOWING SOME SORT OF GRACE PERIOD FOR COMPLIANCE FOLLOWING THE PUBLICATION OF THAT RULES. WOULD ALLOW BUSINESSES TO UPDATE THEIR PRACTICES. I JUST LIKE TO CLOSE BY SAYING THAT MY COMMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP INFORM THE COMMITTEE ON CHALLENGES AT BUSINESSES. YOU KNOW GOOD ACTORS IN MOST CASES WHO WANT TO FOLLOW THE RULES WILL FACE IN TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THE C. C. P.'S REQUIREMENTS. WE SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY THESE COMMENTS AS I SAID I THINK THERE ARE NUMBER OF OTHER PLACES THAT COULD -- WHERE WE COULD USE CLARITY TO HELP -- BUSINESSES EMPLOYMENT BUT I HAVE A SHORT SINCE YOU MIGHT HAVE. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE THAT. OF FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PRACTITIONER HOW DO YOU ADVISE COMPANIES HOW TO COMPLY. AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BE QUESTIONS AS WE GO FORWARD -- WE'RE GOING TO CONCLUDE THIS PANEL WITH COMMENTS FROM ARIAL FARC'S JOHNSON SENIOR. COUNSEL WITH THE POLICY AND PRIVACY -- ON COMMONSENSE WITH COMMON SENSE MEDIA AND KIDS ACTION. AGAIN IF YOU COULD -- PROVIDE US THAT INFORMATION IN ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AND THEN WE WILL OPEN IT UP THIS PANEL UP TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RL FACTS JOHNSON AND I REPRESENT THE NATIONAL KIDS AND FAMILIES ORGANIZATION COMMON SENSE MEDIA WHICH WAS A CO SPONSOR OF THE CCPA. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE MADAM CHAIR AND THE VICE CHAIR FOR THIS IMPORTANT HEARING AND FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. COMMONSENSE HAS OVER A HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION USER CENTER EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS ARE USED AND HALF OF US SCHOOLS INCLUDING BY ALMOST EIGHTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA TEACHERS. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF SPONSORING AND SUPPORTING PRIVACY LEGISLATION AND CALIFORNIA. PARTICULARLY THAT WHICH PROTECTS FAMILIES CHILDREN AND STUDENTS SUCH AS CALIFORNIA'S LANDMARKS OF PEPPER AND LAST YEAR'S CCPA. WE ALSO WORK IN CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY A MANY OF WHOM ARE CALLING AFTER CCPA. AS WELL AS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT. AND ONE OF THE BEST WAYS WE SEE TO PROTECT YOUNG PEOPLE'S PRIVACY IS TO PROTECT EVERYONE'S PRIVACY. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THE MOST SURVEILLED AND TRACK GENERATION ABER THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACTIVITIES HOBBIES AND NETWORKS ARE EXPOSED FROM BIRTH. AND THESE ACTIVITIES ARE FOR SALE. YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND THEIR ENTIRE LIVES CONNECTED IN ORDER TO GET AN EDUCATION AND TO PARTICIPATE IN MODERN SOCIETY. ALL OF THIS DATA MAKES THEM UNIQUELY VALUABLE TO COMPANIES AND UNIQUELY VULNERABLE TO PRIVACY HARMS. WELL ACCESS TO POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY FROM EARLY ON GIVES KIDS ACCESS TO NEW OPPORTUNITIES. IT ALSO MEANS DEVICES AT HOME AT SCHOOL AND EVER IN BETWEEN ARE CONSTANTLY. TRACKING THEM. AND THESE DEVICES CAN USUALLY BE CHEAP AND IT'S A CARE PARTICULARLY ONE ARE TALKING ABOUT A YOUNG KIDS. TôI. MILLIONS OF KIDS AND PARENTS HAVE HAD SENSITIVE INFORMATION. YOU KNOW DINNER TABLE HAT EXPOSED BY CONNECTED DEVICES TOYS TEDDY BEARS BABY CAMERAS. ADDITIONALLY AS KIDS BRAINS ARE STILL DEVELOPING THEY LAGGED BEHIND ADULTS AND CONCEPTUALIZING PRIVACY. AND UNDERSTANDING TERMS OF SERVICE AND RECOGNIZING AT YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE TROUBLE READING A TERMS OF SERVICE ON YOUR CELL PHONE. GIVE IT TO A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD THERE I SAY IT MAY BE A LITTLE BETTER BUT THE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND IT. MOST SCHOOL AGE KIDS CAN'T EVEN DISTINGUISH ADS FROM OTHER CONTENT. KIDS ARE PRONE TO SHARING AN IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR AND ARE LESS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR INFORMATION IF THEY DO PUT IT OUT THERE. UNFORTUNATELY AS A STUDY CONFIRMED INFORMATION IS COLLECTED A SOUL AND REPACKAGED BY DATA BROKERS INCLUDING FOR KIDS AS YOUNG AS TWO YEARS OLD. AND I DON'T EAT THAT VICTIMS CAN BE YOU KNOW THREE MONTHS OLD I THINK IS THE YOUNGEST OF HER DEATH. COMMONSENSE ASK PARENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HOW THEY WANTED TO PROTECT THEIR PRIVACY RIGHTS AN WHAT TOOLS THEY THOUGHT WOULD HELP THEIR FAMILIES. MORE THAN NINE AND TEN PARENTS AND TEENS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WEBSITES CLEARLY LABEL IT DATA THEY COLLECT. AND HOW THEY WILL USE THAT DATA. AND THE SAME NUMBERS THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT SITES ASK PERMISSION BEFORE SELLING OR SHARING DATA. THESE USE INFORM THE VALUES THAT GUIDE OUR APPROACH IN CALIFORNIA. HE'S ACOMMONSENSE WE BELIEVE THAT KIDS NEED THE FREEDOM TO MAKE MISTAKES TO TRY NEW THINGS AND TO FIND THEIR VOICES. UNENCUMBERED BY THE LOOMING THREAT OF A PERMANENT DIGITAL RECORD THAT COULD BE USED AGAINST THEM. KIDS AND REALLY ALL OF US DESERVE A WORLD IN WHICH OUR DAILY MUSINGS OUR FRIENDS ARE NOT ASSESSED BY CORPORATIONS LOOKING TO TURN A PROFIT. BY NEFARIOUS ACTORS LOOKING TO MANIPULATE OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS IS A WORLD THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE SOUGHT TO AVOID WITH CCPA. THE CZ PA IS THE FIRST GENERALLY APPLICABLES CONSUMER PRIVACY LAW IN AMERICA. IT IS NOT LIMITED TO FINANCIAL ARE HEALTH INFORMATION OR ANY SPECIFIC ENTITY BUT IT RECOGNIZES THAT AMERICANS HAVE PRIVACY RIGHTS AND ALL OF THEIR INFORMATION. IT COMPARES FAVORABLY TO OTHER PRIVACY LAWS ESPECIALLY IN THE U. S IN BOTH MOVING US OUT OF SECTOR SPECIFIC LAWS WHICH I THINK ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY OUTDATED AS WE TECHNOLOGY IS. AROUND US AND EVERYTHING NOWADAYS. AND IN MOVING US BEYOND A NOTICE AND CONSENT MODEL. WHEN WE LOOK TO THE GPR HOWEVER THE CCPA COULD BE IMPROVED? BOTH IN TERMS OF GIVING CONSUMERS ADDITIONAL RIGHT AND IN TERMS OF SMALL TWEAKS. TO ENSURE THAT RATES ALREADY OFFERED. ARE REAL AND ABLE TO BE EXERCISED BY INDIVIDUALS. PROFESSOR DILATORY HAS EXPLAINED HOW PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTIONS ARE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN EUROPE. AND HOW THE GPR SUPPORTS US RIGHT. IN CALIFORNIA THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY AS FUNDAMENTAL AS WELL. AND IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THAT LAWS LIKE THIS THE CPA SUPPORT. ARTICLE ONE SECTION ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION PROVIDES A CALIFORNIANS HAVE AN INALIENABLE RIGHT TO PURSUE AND OBTAIN PRIVACY. ALSO SIMILARTO EUROPE THE CALIFORNIA AND TRYING THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. IN RESPONSE TO FEARS OVER INCREASED SURVEILLANCE AND DATA COLLECTION BY MODERN TECHNOLOGY. SO HOW DOES THE CCPA COMPARED TO THE G. P. ARE AND WHERE COULD BE STRENGTHENED TO ENSURE IT IS SUPPORTING CALIFORNIANS INALIENABLE RIGHT TO PRIVACY. ONE MAJOR DISTINGUISHING FEATURE THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT ALREADY TODAY BETWEEN THE GDP ARE IN THE C. CPI. IS THE BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT PROCESSING IS OKAY. UNDER GPR. THE BASELINE ASSUMPTION IS THAT A COMPANY. SHOULD NOT COLLECT USE STYLE NATION. UNLESS THEY HAVE A LAWFUL BASIS FOR DOING SO. UNDER THE C. CPI THE DEFAULT RULE IS THAT IT'S OKAY FOR COMPANIES TO DO WHAT THEY WISH. UNTIL AN INDIVIDUAL SAYS NOW. AND THEN WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL CAN SAY NO. TO IS LIMITED IT TO STOP THE SALE OF THEIR DATA. COLLECTION AND USE OUR DATA MINIMIZATION ARE NOT COVERED BY THE LOT ALL. WELL THE C. CPI IS A HUGE STEP FORWARD FOR THE U. S.. IT'S STILL FALL SHORT OF THE GDP ARE IN TERMS OF AVAILABLE PROTECTION. AND IT PUTS THE ONUS FOR ACTION AND FOR PROTECTION UNDER THE CONSUMER WHO HAS TO SAY NOW. USING THIS CONCEPTS OUT OF IT MORE FIRST IS THAT THE BASS LINE IS IT'S OKAY FOR COMPANIES TO DO WHAT THEY WISH. WITH DATA. COMPANIES HAVE NO REQUIREMENTS TO BUILD IN PRIVACY BY DESIGN OR TO PRACTICE DATA MINIMIZATION. THE BURDEN IS ON THE INDIVIDUAL TO OBJECT. AND I JUST APPOINT ABOUT THAT OBJECTING HEARD THAT ONE OF THE MORE PRESCRIPTIVE THINGS IN THE CALIFORNIA LAW IS THAT THERE IS THIS DO NOT SELL LINK -- ONE DO NOT SELL WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE PRETTY CLEAR TO A CONSUMER WHAT IT MEANS I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S A MORE CLEARLY TO STATE THAT. BUT TO THE REASON THAT. IT HAS TO SAY DO NOT SELL AND IT HAS TO BE SO PRESCRIPTIVE IN THAT CASE. IS BECAUSE THE BURDEN IS ON THE INDIVIDUAL WANT TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO EXERCISE THIS RIGHT. IF IF COMPANIES WANTED TO MAKE THE BURDEN ON THEM TO NOT DO ANYTHING UNTIL INDIVIDUALS THAT IT WAS OKAY THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THIS PRESCRIPTIVE JOSTLE REQUIREMENT. BUT SNCE THE ONUS IS ON THE INDIVIDUAL YOU WANT TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE TO EXERCISE THAT. SO THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE G. D. P. R.. ADDITIONALLY AS I MENTIONED. THE RIGHT TO OBJECT IS NOT FOR COLLECTION OR USE BUT ONLY FOR SALE. WELL SALAS INTENDED TO BE BROADLY DEFINED TO COVER SITUATIONS ARE COMPANIES ARE SHARING DATA. ARE OFFERING ACCESS TO DATA IN EXCHANGE FOR OTHER VALUABLE CONSIDERATION. I COMPANIES PURELY INTERNAL USE OF INFORMATION IS NOT TOUCHED BY THE C. CPI. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT SELL BE DEFINED. BROADLY BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT A SITUATION WHERE COMPANIES SAYING -- I DON'T SELL DATA BECAUSE I'M JUST SHARING. ACCESS TO IT IN EXCHANGE FOR SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S THAT SEEMS LIKE SALES -- IN DISCUSSING DEFAULT I WOULD BE REMISS IN NOT NOTING A CRITICAL PLACE FOR THE CCPA DOES OFFER IMPORTANT DEFAULT PROTECTIONS. AND THAT IS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS WAY THIS EASY PAY IS LIKE THE G. P. ARE. BOTH IN TERMS OF A PROTECTIVE DEFAULT AND IN TERMS OF RECOGNIZING THE UNIQUE VULNERABILITY OF MINORS. IF YOU'RE UNDER. SIXTEEN YOU OR A PARENT IF YOU'RE UNDER THIRTEEN HOUSE TO OPT IN BEFORE YOUR DATA CAN BE SOLD TO A THIRD PARTY IN CALIFORNIA. G. P. R. ALSO OFFERS HEAVY PROTECTIONS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE INCLUDING A MECHANISM FOR PARENTAL CONSENT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. I'M IN THE GPR ANYONE UNDER EIGHTEEN IS RECOGNIZED AS A VULNERABLE POPULATION. ANOTHER PLACE FOR C. CPI IN GDP ARE THE SAME. ISN'T PROBABLY DEFINING PERSONAL INFORMATION I THINK WE'VE HEARD BOTH THE CPA IS BROADER GPR IS BROADER I THINK THEY'RE BOTH THEY'RE BOTH PRETTY BROAD DEFINITIONS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. SO FOR DECADES CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE HAS DEFIED PERSONAL INFORMATION AS ANY INFORMATION THAT IDENTIFIES RELATES TO DESCRIBES OR IS CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH US. THE CCPA CONTINUES IN THIS TRADITION AND IT PROVIDES ANOTHER NUMBER OF EXAMPLES OF THINGS THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION CUT INCLUDED LIKE UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS THIS IS AFTER ALL HOW MANY COMPANIES. IDENTIFY US AND PUT US INTO VARIOUS ADVERTISING AND OTHER MARK APR SIMILARLY TO FIND PERSONAL DATA AS ANY INFORMATION RELATING TO AN IDENTIFIED OR IDENTIFIABLE NATURAL PERSON. AND THAT IS A PERSON WHO CAN BE IDENTIFIED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY GPR ALSO INCLUDES I LANDED ON A FIRE. GIVEN THAT COMPANIES CAN TELL IF WE ARE PREGNANT NOT ONLY FROM WHAT WE INPUT INTO OUR APPS. BUT FROM THE HEART RATE THAT ARE FIT BIT IS IS TRACKING ON US. TO OUR PURCHASES AT TARGET OR THEY CAN TELL WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN LAID OFF BASED ON YOUR NERGY USAGE PATTERN CHANGES ARE WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING TV. A BROAD DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED MAKES THAT. ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS DESERVING OF PROTECTION. AND ONE POINT WITH RESPECT TO PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOUSEHOLD. WELL I THINK IT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE. IN LOOKING AT HOW HOUSEHOLD IS DEFINED AND HOW THAT WORKS IN TERMS OF EXERCISING DIFFERENT REQUESTS FOR EXAMPLE. I HAVE LESS OF A CONCERN THAT MY ROOMMATE IS GOING TO OUT ME OUT OF OF YOU KNOW. INFORMATION SELLING SOMEWHERE IN THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE DETRIMENT TO ME. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE COVER HOUSEHOLDS BECAUSE THAT IS HOW COMPANIES PROFILE FAMILIES AND KIDS. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN COMPANIES SAID THAT A TELEPHONE NUMBER WAS NOT PERSONAL INFORMATION BECAUSE IT WASN'T LINKED TO AN INDIVIDUAL IT WAS LINKED TO THE FAMILY HOME. WE DON'T WANT THE SAME TO BE TRUE FOR SMART TV'S AND FOR THERMOSTATS SO WE NEED TO THINK OF A WAY. TO INCLUDE HOUSEHOLD AND TO INCLUDE IT SMARTLY SO. WHILE THE CCPA DOES HAVE THIS BROAD DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. IT DOES NOT EXTEND DATA SECURITY REQUIREMENTS TO ALL OF THIS INFORMATION. AND TO THIS EXTENT IT DOES NOT GO AS FAR AS THE G. D. P. R.. C. CPA'S DATA BREACH PROVISIONS ONLY COVER AND NARROW SWATH OF PERSONAL INFORMATION LARGELY CABIN TO FINANCIAL MEDICAL SOCIAL SECURITY TYPE INFORMATION. SO INTO MY CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN A PARENT AND A CHILD OVERSEE MENTAL HEALTH CONCERN HOMEWORK PULLING. A VIDEO RECORDING FROM A BEDROOM. IF THAT WAS BREACHED. YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT UNDER THE SEA CPA. THE NARROWNESS OF THIS DATA SECURITY BREACH PROVISION REQUIREMENT IS INTERESTING. BECAUSE THE BRIDGE PROVISIONS HAS DRAWN A LOT OF ATTENTION. PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS ATTACHED. AND MISTER RETIRED EXPLAINED HOW OF THERE'S A NAG THERE'S THIS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. SO THIS BRINGS ME TO A FINAL WAY THAT THE CCPA FALL SHORT IN COMPARISON TO THE G. P. R. FOR CONSUMERS AND THAT IS IN ENFORCEMENT. THE CZ PA DOES HAVE THIS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. BUT IT'S ONLY FOR NEGLIGENT DATA SECURITY BREACH US. THE GPR HAS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ACROSS THE BOARD. IT ALLOWS FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BRING CLAIMS INCLUDING FOR NON MATERIAL DAMAGES LIKE HARM AND DISTRESS. IT ALLOWS ADVOCACY GROUPS TO BRING ACTIONS ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS. AND HAS SERIOUS FINANCIAL PENALTIES INDEED THESE PENALTIES ARE MUCH OF WHAT MAY COMPANIES SET UP AND COMPLY. BECAUSE A NUMBER OF GDP. REQUIREMENTS EXISTED PREVIOUSLY BUT THERE WAS NO REAL FINANCIAL FINANCIAL DETERRENCE. TO THE C. CPI WITH ITS VERY LIMITED PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION MAY NOT SERVE THE SAME TO TURN. FUNCTION AS THE G. D. P. R. AND IF COMPANIES ARE DETERRED THAN CONSUMERS WILL NOT ENJOY REAL PROTECTIONS UNDER THE LAW. CONSUMERS ARE NOT ALONE HERE AND WANTING MORE PROTECTIONS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO'S TOSSED WITH ENFORCING THIS LAW IN ADDITION TO IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS. HAS STATED IT CONCERNS ABOUT RESOURCES AND HAS ASKED THAT A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BE EXPANDED. WELL THE CCPA DOES REPRESENT A NEW OFFER COMPANIES SO I WOULD NOTE IT DOES NOT APPLY TO ALL COMPANIES ON LIKE THE G. P. R. EVEN ALL ENTITIES LIKE NON PROFITS AND GOVERNMENTS THERE IS A CARVE OUT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. IT CONTAINS MANY SIMILAR PROVISION TO THE G. P. R.. AND AS I'VE DISCUSSED IT DOES NOT HAVE ALL OF THEM INCLUDING OF VARIOUS BUREAUCRATIC AND RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS. WELL I WOULDN'T ASK TO HAVE ALL THOSE BROUGHT TO THE U. S. I WOULD SUPPORT PROFESSOR DILATORY IS. A INTEREST IN HAVING DEDICATED AND TRAIN PRIVACY PROFESSIONALS -- TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT YOU WANT TO WRITE IN OUR NEED TO WRITE INTO US LAW. AS YOU CAN -- THE CCPA COMPARED TO OTHER LAWS AND ITS WORKABILITY FOR COMPANIES. AFTER YOU ALSO CONSIDER HOW IT COMPARES FOR CONSUMERS AND WHAT ITS WORKABILITY IS FOR CALIFORNIANS [inaudible] THANK YOU. VERY MUCH OF VERY INTERESTING PERSPECTIVES AND CERTAINLY -- WORTHY OF LOTS OF CONSIDERATION I CHANGED. I HAVE -- ONE QUESTIONED OF FOR MISLEAD POSTED WE HEAR A LOT THAT -- BY USING. A BY CREATING C. C. P. R. AS HE SHOULD BE A RATHER -- WE ARE -- GOING TO DESTROY THE BUSINESS MODEL OF COMPANIES THAT COMPANIES ARE GOING TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS I THINK A MR MCTAGGART POINTED OUT THAT IN THE FIFTIES THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY. FAST THAT WE WERE DESTROYING THEIR THEIR BUSINESS MODEL BY CALLING FOR SAFETY AND TOBACCO AND HE LEFT OUT THE OIL INDUSTRY THAT'S ANOTHER ONE AND IN TRYING. TO CREATE RENEWABLES BUT I WOULD BE REMISS ON BEHALF OF MY COMMUNITIES -- NOT TO POINT TO THE OIL INDUSTRY -- BUT I'M WONDERING THE FACT THAT COMPANIES. HAVE ALREADY GOT A COMPLY WITH G. D. P. R. -- THE FACT THAT WE NOW HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THIS THIS REGULATION A COMPANIES THAT ARE. OF COMPLYING OR TRYING TO COMPLY WITH GDP ARE ARE THEY ATA DISADVANTAGE OR ARE THEY IN FACT -- THAT HAVE SORT OF A LEG UP. IN THE EFFORTS TO COMPLY WAS CCPA BECAUSE THEY ARE ALREADY WORKING TOWARDS COMPLIANCE WITH A DIFFERENT BUT PERHAPS IN MANY WAYS MORE STRINGENT -- SET OF REQUIREMENTS. SURE AND AND IT'S GOING TO DEPEND IS THE AS I MENTIONED NOT EVERY COMPANY -- FIRST WILL NOT EVERY COMPANY SUBJECT TO SEE CPA WAS SUBJECT TO DUTY PR FOR THE COMPANIES WHO ARE AND THEY'RE STARTING FROM SCRATCH. OTHER COMPANIES WHO DID TAKE STEPS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY YOU KNOW CONDUCTED THOSE ENTERPRISE WIDE ASSESSMENT AND I DO THINK THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE LEG WORK TAKES PLACE IT'S REALLY -- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU KIND OF GET INTO THE WEEDS OF THE COMPANY AND IN WHICH DATA IS COLLECTED I MEAN IMAGINE A COMPANY THAT INITIALLY STARTED SELLING YOU KNOW WIDGETS AND THEN YOU KNOW SELLING THINGS HEART LIKE. THE MAIL BECAME OBSOLETE INTO NOW THEY HAVE IT NOW THEY HAVE A A DIGITAL PLATFORM MAYBE THEY'VE ACQUIRED SOME COMPANIES. THOSE KIND OF COMPANIES HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT DATABASES THEY HAVE DIFFERENT OWNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS AND SO THE PROCESS JUST TO KIND OF COLLECT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT INFORMATION WE HAVEHOW WE USING IT ACROSS THE COMPANY. IF THEY WEREN'T REQUIRED TO KIND OF ENGAGE IN THAT ASSESSMENT BEFORE IT JUST TAKES TIME TO KIND OF GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS. A SO FOR COMPANIES WHO DID THAT PROCESS FOR THE G. P. R. I DO THINK THAT THEY ARE. OF YOU KNOW FAR ALONG THE WAY OF THE PROCESS LIKE I SAID THERE ARE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT THEY NEED TO ANSWER HERE -- BUT HAVING GONE THROUGH SOME OF THE GDP OUR PROCESS I THINK DOES PUT YOU AT AN ADVANTAGE. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW COMPANIES WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS I THINK THAT A DEPEND ON THE SIZE BUT I DO THINK YOU HAVE KIND OF TWO CONSIDERATIONS IS TO KEEP IN MIND. YOU KNOW REGULATIONS LIKE THIS ALWAYS FAVOR OF LARGER COMPANIES WHO HAVE MORE RESOURCES SUCH JUST A FACT OF THE MATTER SO THE BIGGER YOU ARE THE EASIER IT IS FOR YOU. TO COMPLY AND PIVOT OR TAKE THE RISK IN SOME CASES OF LAWSUITS BECAUSE THAT MIGHT BE BUILT INTO YOUR BUSINESS MODEL. AND I I DO THINK THAT WITH THIS AND YOU KNOW THE SUPPLIES ACROSS THE BOARD TO A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES. BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE DESIRE HERE IS IS TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION OF DATA BEING SHARED ONLINE. AND I THINK IT IS THE ADVERTISING I THINK THEY WERE HIT WELL AND YOU SAW A LOT OF THOSE COMPANIES PULLING OUT OF THE ISSUE. A LOT OF TARGETED ADVERTISING AND ONLINE ADVERTISING HAS BEEN REDUCED AND I DID YOU KNOW AND AND THE IO REGULATORS HATE -- THE CONCEPT OF THE AD SUPPORTED INTERNET AND SO YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN AND AND THAT BUSINESS BUT HERE WE'VE SUPPORTED IT AND I THINK CONSUMERS DO GET A BENEFIT FROM. VISITING SITES AND NOT HAVING TO PAY FOR I MEAN I'M I UNDERSTAND THAT THE BALANCE I THINK LIKE I SAID. COMPANIES UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO BE A BALANCE OF PRIVACY BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT SOME OF THOSE MODELS WILL SHIFT BASED ON HOW THE LAW IS CONSTRUCTED [inaudible] END OF SOLD SOME OF THE MODELS WILL SHIP -- ARE. IS I UNDERSTAND IT MOST OF THE COLLECTION OF DATA COMES FROM THESE BIGGER ENTITIES -- THAT COULD WHERE PEOPLE TEND TO DO MORE BUSINESS PLATFORMS LIKE. FACEBOOK FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE OF THINGS I DON'T KNOW WHAT. NEITHER SENATOR DODD NOTION OR STERN WE'RE HERE AT THE BEGINNING AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW THIS BUT ONE OF THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS MISUSES OF INFORMATION -- WAS DISCUSSED AND I JUST HAVE TO REPEAT IT BECAUSE I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE OF A IN THE VIOLATING OF ONE'S PRIVACY -- THAN THIS EXAMPLE IS FOR THE FITBIT TO GET PREGNANT WE'LL PROVIDE PUT INTO THE FITBIT THERE'RE -- MENSTRUAL CYCLE. AND THE FITBIT WILL TELL THEM WHEN THEY ARE OVULATING. THAT INFORMATION UNBEKNOWNST TO THESE WOMEN IS BEING TRANSMITTED AS WE SPEAK TO FACEBOOK. THEY ARE ACTUALLY ACQUIRING THAT INFORMATION WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OR THE KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT OF THESE WOMEN WHO ARE USING THE FITBIT. TO PERHAPS A SYSTEM IN. FINDING OUT YOU KNOW HAVING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN THEY POPULATED IN THE DESIRE TO HAVE CHILDREN AND MY POINT WAS AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY TRUE IF YOU DON'T WANT YOUR MOTHER TO KNOW -- THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HAVE CHILDREN WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU WANT FACEBOOK OR SOME OTHER STRANGER TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION. AND I THINK THAT FOR THE YOUNG WOMEN HERE OR FOR THE MOTHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS WHEN WE ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW SO ALL. IN ALL -- WE WE THE CHILDREN WILL TELL YOU WHEN THEY'RE READY TO TELL YOU ANYA FACEBOOK IS GONNA KNOW THAT. AND ISN'T THAT SOMETHING THAT IS JUST BEYOND THE PALE -- IN SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS A CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA AS WELL AS ANOTHER SO -- I I I THINK THAT THAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WE DID YOU WANNA RESPONSE JUST RESPOND TO THAT QUICKLY I I I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE LAW DOESN'T DISTINGUISH I THINK WE TALK ABOUT THESE EXAMPLES. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS TYPICALLY INVOLVES SENSITIVE DATA HEALTH DATA FINANCIAL DATA OR VULNERABLE CLASSES LIKE CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE -- FOR INVOLVES THE HARM CAUSED BY THAT DATA AND THOSE ISSUES ARE PARTICULARLY ADDRESS THERE'SNO KIND OF DISTINCTION BETWEEN PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT IS SENSITIVE AND JUST KIND OF RUN OF THE MILL PERSON INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HAVE. YOU KNOW LESS OF AN IMPACT ON AN INDIVIDUAL -- SO I THINK IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO CREATE A DISTINCTION THERE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PROTECTION THAT ARE REQUIRED WHEN DATA IS EITHER SENSITIVE OR IT STARTS OFF YOU KNOW AS AN EMAIL ADDRESS AND THEN CENTS A PIECE OF THE DATE ARE APPENDED TO IT BECAUSE I THINK. THAT THAT THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD DISAGREE THAT YOU KNOW YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION I'M A CONSUMERS WHILE I DON'T WANT MY HEALTH INFORMATION SHARED WITH A THIRD PARTY WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE. OF AND SO I THINK THAT IS THAT THE VALID THAT'S A VALID CONSIDERATION I WILL SAY ALSO THAT. YES BIG COMPANIES ARE THE CONSUMER FACING CO OR AND MANY CASES BIG COMPANIES ARE THE CONSUMER FACING COMPANIES BUT THE AD TECH ECOSYSTEM IS A MASSIVE ECOSYSTEM THERE ARE NUMBER OF THIRD PARTY PLAYERS THAT ARE OPERATING -- AND I KNOW THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUE AGAIN BRINGING LIGHT -- BUT IT'S NOT JUST SORT OF THESE BIG COMPANIES I THINK THE LAWS ADDRESSED TO THEM BUT HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR A NUMBER OF SMALLER COMPANIES AS WELL. AGAIN FOR IT FOCUSES THOUGH ON THE CONSUMER RIGHTS -- AND WOOD AS WE WERE TALKING WE NEED TO BALANCE SOME BUT I THINK THE CONSUMER RIGHTS AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY. ARE THE CONCERN SHOULD BE THE CONCERN. I SET THE SO I'M HOPING YOU. TO JOKE -- ABOUT A ABOUT A YEAR. YOU AND I LAUGHED A LOT ABOUT THE DEAL MARKET FOR JEWISH MOTHERS PAYING FOR THEIR SON IN LAWS YOU FOR THEIR DAUGHTER IN LAWS -- YOU KNOW OF INFORMATION. THAT THAT I'M SURE THERE'S A MARKET THERE SO -- SO ALL THE MORE REASON TO PREVENT IT FROM -- FROM -- FROM FROM FROM BEING ALLOWED TO BE SOLD I MEAN IT REALLY IS EXTRAORDINARY AND AND AND I I I GUESS I IT'S SHOCKING REALLY IN A I KNOW WE ALL WANT. YEAH WE'RE WE'RE PROUD OF THESE TECH BUSINESSES THAT ARE GROWING CALIFORNIA AND AND AND YOU KNOW PROVIDING ALL SORTS OF ACCESS INFORMATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME -- THERE'S JUST THERE'S A LINE THAT THAT HAS BEEN CROSS OVER AND OVER AGAIN BY SOME OF OUR FOLKS HERE IN -- YOU KNOW I WAS ONE WAS INTERESTED IN. AND MR LETTER IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT AND ABOUT. I HAD THE A POLITICAL -- AT THE THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR FOR POLITICAL. HI CAMPAIGNS IN AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE RECENT THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING LEASE HERE AND I'D STATES WITH REGARDS TO FOREIGN INTERVENTION ARE ELECTIONS ARE. YOU KNOW -- BUT HOW DOES THIS INTERPLAY IN EUROPE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN DATA ATTEMPTS -- WITH WITH WITH SOME OF THE DOMESTIC POLITICS OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HOW IS THIS PLAYING INTO. THE CONVERSATION ABOUT GDP ARE AND WHAT WHAT SHOULD WE BE THINKING ABOUT. IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF FOREIGN INTERVENTION OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM. AND IN THE USE OF THESE PLATFORMS FOR THAT. FROM MY MY PERSONAL COMING THIS IS. OBVIOUSLY A REALLY BIG SUBJECT -- SO KEEP YOUR PRE. THESE NEWS THAT WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING IN BOTH IN EUROPE BUT IN THE U. S. ABOUT THE USE OF THE INFORMATION TO TARGET POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT IN MANIPULATE PEOPLE'S. OPINIONS. ARE BAD AS I THE THE PROTECTION LITTLE EDIE'S FUNDAMENTAL FOR THE UT THE EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE -- IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT THE YOU QUE THEY AYE SEAL. WAS REALLY. INVOLVED IN THE WHOLE SITUATION WITH CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA IN THE U. K. -- FROM THE BEGINNING I KNOW THAT MANY OF THE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN USED -- TO INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION -- OBVIOUSLY. FROM THAT THE THE PROTECTION RESPECT BETWEEN YOUR OF THE CONDUCT WAS. AGAINST THE LAW IT'S NOT. M. EVEN THE QUESTION RIGHT WE WHEN I PROVIDING EUROPE MY REMARKS I MENTIONED THE SAY THE ELF ON THE DEPOSITION RIGHT INTO A LITTLE UNETHICAL USES OF THE THAT THAT WAS. UNDER YOU BEING LOW ON AN ETHICAL USE OF THE THAT AND THEREFORE HE WAS -- I LEGAL. SO WHAT SO SO WHAT WHAT WAS THE LAW THAT WAS VIOLATED. IN EUROPE AND AND I SAY SENIOR SAYING THAT IT WASN'T NECESSARILY CANCEL HEARING ANSWER [inaudible] WELL. YOU KNOW THAT I THAT IS A BIG SUBJECT RIGHT BUT I DON'T KNOW OF ANY PRIVACY LAW THAT WAS VIOLATED BY THE CONDUCT -- IN THE U. S. THEM THERE ARE MANY LOS I'M NOT AWARE OF SO THERE MIGHT BE OTHER LAWS HE WAS -- ONE OF THE LOS THAT WAS IDENTIFYING EURO BEST A LAW THAT HAD BEING VIOLATED AND I HAVE. THE THURMOND. CONSEQUENCES OF THAT. ARE QUITE INTERESTING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T. GENERALLY REALIZE FROM THE U. K. U. S. PERSPECTIVE IS THAT. BECAUSE UPS THINK THESE FUNDAMENTAL VIEW APPROACH ABOUT THE THE PROTECTION. THE FACT THAT CAN REGIONAL LEGAL TO A BY BY THEIR LOSS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE THE THOUGH IF YOU THE ANSWER NOT. SO -- MAN FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF YOU KNOW THEIR ACTIVITIES -- DEFINITELY THEY WERE AGAINST THE LAW ALL OF THE U. K. AT THE TIME. AND THE THE OUTCOME IS LIKELY THAT THEY WILL YOU KNOW DISAPPEAR AS AN ORGANIZATION. IF I CAN USE A JOKE THAT I HAVE USED IN THE PAST TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHTS FROM MY STUDENTS IS -- USUALLY A CONDO WITH OUR LEGAL CLEARLY IN EUROPE I'M NOT SURE THAT IT WAS CLEARLY A LEGAL IN THE YES SAY OKAY LET ME OPEN THE FILE HE SAYS HERE MARCH FIFTH YOU WERE. FOUND BY THE POLICE AND YOU WERE -- TAKEN TO THE PRESENT AND YOUR LACK OF RESULTED -- US POSITIVE OF METHAMPHETAMINE I SAID ALL YES YES I WAS USING METHAMPHETAMINE. UNDIGESTED BUT YOU'RE PLEADING NOT GUILTY. TO CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES THAT HE SAID. WELL. METHAMPHETAMINE IS NOT UNDER CONTROL. THE POINT IS THAT ONE THING IS TO PROHIBIT THE CONDUCT. I WENT A DIFFERENT THING IS TO AVOID THE COMBO PRICE SO WITH THESE CLEAR TO ME IS THAT THE IN EUROPE THE CONDO WAS PRETTY WITH THAT. IT WAS NOT A BOY THAT ARMS NOT AVOIDED THE IT THAT I CAN BE JULY THE HAD ALSO -- ANY FINANCING BREXIT. AND SO THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT HE ALSO TO PLEASE REGARDING EUROPEAN ELECTION RIGHT YEAH. OKAY HARD TO PUT YOUR ARMS AROUD AND THIS IS I I GIVE THEIR ATTENTION. SENATOR STERN DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOLLOWED BY VICE CHAIR. QUESTION NOT A JOKE ALTHOUGH I KNOW THIS IS. ALL ABOUT JOKES -- WHAT IS SINCE MAY THE GPR ROEG'S TOOK AFFECT WHAT'S THE HOW MUCH IS THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BEEN UTILIZED AS AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM SO THAT'S? THAT'S AN OPEN QUESTION THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF HIGHLIGHTED OVER THE SAY THE OTHER JEEP YOUR OCCURRENCE OF PRIVATE RIGHT THE FUNCTION EAST THROUGH -- BUT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT AND YOUR HOUSE NOT BEING HARMONIZING THE SAME WITH THE U. S. CLASPING HER WAY SO YOU IT DOESN'T HAVE A FEDERAL COURT. SO ALL OF THESE PRIVATE RIGHTS WILL HAVE TO BE FOUGHT AND WON OVER THE RIGHTS OF THE INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES. SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU WILL MY HALF ACCORDING IS BEING DECIDED THAT. A PERSON DOESN'T HAVE A SPENDING EARLY TO EVALUATE WHAT THE RESULT IS GOING TO BE OF THESE PRIVATE RIGHT THE FACTION BUT THESE DEFINITELY ENABLE BY GDP ARE WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO PLAY OUT. YOU HAVE ANY SENSE QUANTITY WISE THE OF HOW MANY FILINGS HAVE BEEN. MADE OVERALLS ANYONE SORT OF TRACKING THAT BUT I AM NOT AWARE OF ANYBODY THAT HAS BEEN TRACKING THAT. CASO BUT WHEN IT SAYS AT IN OUR BACK REMEMBRANCES A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IT IN AN UNDERSEA CPA LIMITED TO DATA BREACHES ONLY BUT THAT IT JUST SAYS YES FOR GDP ARE YOU'RE SAYING THIS THIS QUESTION IS STANDING IN JURISDICTION. THE END UP AS THE PRIVATE COLLECTION I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE THE PRIVATE RIGHT THE FUNCTION IS GOING TO BE IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY -- DRIVING OUTCOMES FOR THE PLAINTIFFS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO THE PAIN OF THE PROCEDURAL RULES OF THE IN DEFENDING COUNTRIES THAT FORM THE EUROPEAN UNION. SO IN OTHER WORDS THE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT BE OBVIOUS BUT THEY'LL BE DICTATED BASED ON THE THE SORT OF WAY HOWEVER THE CIVIL PROCEDURE WORKS IN WHATEVER THAT PARTICULAR NATION IS THAT'S RIGHT HOW THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WORKS AREN'T SEXY HOT THE WHAT I ANTICIPATE IS THAT BECAUSE WE WE HAVE. THE SAME CHALLENGE HERE WITH PRIVATE RIGHT DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT MATCHES AND THAT HAS BEEN AN EFFECTIVE BUT WE YEAR TO AB YES -- AND EFFECTIVE -- RESTRAIN ON THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO ACTUALLY -- OF THE NEW POSITIVE OUTCOMES WHEN THE APPROVED AS TO FOR A PRIVACY VIOLATION I THINK THAT WE MIGHT FIND THE SAME THING AT THE EUROPEAN LEVEL BUT IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TWENTY SIMPLY BECAUSE I ONLY KNOW THE LOSS OF HIS BEING QUITE HONESTLY. AND THE IT COULD WORK IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS FROM THE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. CAN I GET YOU BY MISTAKE THANK YOU FOR AND THIS IS IN -- ABOUT PRIVATE RIGHT BUT I BUT WE HAVE HEARD THAT HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED WITH THE DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES AND I THINK THAT'S A CHANNEL THAT A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING THERE IS A WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS THAT. WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW IS GOING THROUGH EVALUATING THOSE COMPLAINTS AND WE EXPECT TO SEE ENFORCEMENT TAKE PLACE OVER THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR AS A KIND OF? GO THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED SO MY AT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT MANY OF THE ISSUES ARE BEING DEALT WITH THAT THE DPA LEVEL. BUT THE G. P. R. DID GIVE WHAT IS SIMILAR TO THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION I DON'T THINK THERE REALLY IS A CONCEPT OF CLASS ACTION PREVIOUSLY IN THE EO BUT IT DID GIVE THIS CONCEPT OF BRINGING A COLLECTIVE ACTION UNDER THE DTP ARE. AND THERE BUT A COUPLE F COLLECTIVE ACTION FILED -- BY CONSUMER ADVOCATE GROUPS ONE LED BY MAX RAIMES WHO IS A GUY WHO CHALLENGED -- THE US DOES YOU SAFE HARBOR AND THEN JOE AND ARE THEY MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE LIKE CAN YOU BE PARTY TO A SOME KIND OF COLLECTIVE ACTION LIKE THAT AND FILE WITH IT WITH THE DPA. IS WELL OR THEY MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE LIKE TO HAVE THAT SORT OF PARTS -- ADMINISTRATIVE A REGULATORY PATH AND THEN PURSUE OR YOU THERE THEY CAN HAPPEN IN HIGHER LOW. OKAY. THE HISTORICALLY MOST OF THE COMPLAINTS FOR THE THE POSITION BY LESIONS HAVE GONE THROUGH THE DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES AND EVEN -- MAX'S RAMMED HIS COMPLAIN THAT LED TO THE FIFTY MILLION. A FINE FOR GLOBAL HE FIRED WITH IT THE THE POSITION AUTHORITY OF FRIENDS SO IT'S MORE TYPICAL FOR THE THE PROTECTION LOW TO BE ENFORCED THROUGH. THE REGULATORY AGENCY THROUGH THE CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY THAT THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION OKAY. THAT IS AN OPTION AS WELL THEY CAN GO THROUGH -- THE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATORY PROCESS RATHER THAN THE COURTS OKAY THANK YOU -- TO THE BORDERS. I'M I'M JUST GOING TO ADD LITTLE THING TO THAT SO THE UPN RIGHT TO THE THE PROTECTION THAT THESE IN THE CONSTITUTION EQUIVALENT OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS. ACTUALLY SAYS THAT YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY THAT WILL LOOK AT YOUR COMPLAINTS WILL RAISE AN ISSUE THAT HAS TO DO WITH IT OPERATIONS SO THAT IS GRANTED ON EUROPEANS AND THERE'S ALWAYS THAT THE RECORDS. TO THANK AMENITIES. OF BEING -- A FRESHMAN OF LEGISLATOR IF YOU'LL MY COLLEAGUES WILL OBLIGE ME ON SOME THESE BASIC IMPACT THAT THAT -- THIS LEGISLATION IS GOING TO HAVE ON BUSINESSES AND I ASKED IF ANYONE COULD QUANTIFY OR PROJECT OUT SOME. SOME QUANTIFIABLE DATA ON HOW MANY BUSINESSES WILL GO UNDER FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND OF COURSE I'VE NOT YET SEEN ANYTHING. ABOUT THAT BUT IF WE WERE TO USE AN EXAMPLE OF LET'S SAY A RETAILER. IN A RETAILER. GATHERS DATA -- AND THAT RETAILERS THE PRIMARY USER OF THAT DATA. AND THEN THAT PRIMARY USER -- SELLS IT OR DISCLOSES THAT INFORMATION TO SECONDARY USERS. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. IF CERTAIN INDUSTRIES ARE FEARFUL THAT THEY WILL -- HAVE A REDUCTION IN BUSINESS OR MARKET SHARE -- IS THIS A MITIGATED BOWL SITUATION WHEN. THE PRIMARY USER CAN. LOOK UPON THAT DATA IN MAKE EITHER RETAINING PROFESSIONAL TO DO SO OR THEMSELVES. ARE LOOK UPON THE PURCHASING PATTERNS OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND MAYBE EVEN THE CONSUMER PROFILES. ARE THEY COME ABOUT FROM THAT GATHERED INFORMATION IN IT IN AND DISAGGREGATED FORMAT. THEY COULD THEN. SELL OR DISCLOSE THAT. OUR INFORMATION AS LONG AS IT'S DISAGGREGATED IS THAT CORRECT. MAYBE I DON'T KNOW IT AND MISS JOHNSON MAYBE I THINK YOU -- IT'S A COMPANY COULD TAKE AGGREGATED AND DE IDENTIFIED INFORMATION AND AND SHARE SO THE CCPA DOES HAVE -- EXEMPTIONS THAT ALLOW FOR BUSINESSES TO DO EXACTLY THAT THE THINGS THAT THE IDENTIFIED AND THAT MEANS ARE STILL ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MARKET. BEHAVIOR YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL THE YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO AYE DISSIDENT IT WILL EXACTLY. BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT IF WE'RE HEARING THAT MARKET SHARE WILL BE LOST. BUSINESSES MAKE A WONDER. I'M WONDERING TO WHAT EXTENT IS THAT ACCURATE IF WE UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU CAN STILL UNDERSTAND CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR IN IN PURCHASING PROFILES. PUT THAT BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. EACH IS THE PURCHASING PROFILE JUST NOT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS KNOWN. IF HE SAID IS IT FAIR TO I THINK THAT'S FAIR IF YOU'RE IF YOU. APPROPRIATELY DE IDENTIFIED OR AGGREGATE OF THE DATA YOU CAN STILL CLEAN A LOT OF INSIGHTS FROM IT. AS A BUSINESS AND YOU'RE STILL ABLE TO DO THAT AT THE C. CPI. THE ABSURD YEAH I THINK WE HAVE ---AND THAT MIGHT BE COVERED UNDER THE CONCEPT OF SU DONNA MAIS DATA MAYBE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE DATA THAT IS EITHER. HOSTER MASKS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE YEAH I DON'T TO FIVE WILL PIECES OF THE DATA BUT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE REST OF THE PROFILE INFORMATION PERSONALLY SANITIZED RIGHT RIGHT EXACTLY AND I THINK THAT IS GENERALLY COVER BUT IT'S NOT SORT OF AS SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED. AS IT IS UNDER -- UNDER THE GPR SO THAT IS ONE PLACE FOR THE COULD BE CLARIFICATION OF DATA IS SHARED AN ACE TO DONNA MAIS FORMAT -- THAT THAT MIGHT ALLOW MORE LEEWAY -- FOR SOME OF THESE BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS. I JUST I THINK SYNONYMIZED IS IS DIFFERENT THAN DE IDENTIFIED AGGREGATE IT AND YOU CAN SOMETIMES TELL THE INDIVIDUALS AND I TELL THE IDENTITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL. MORE EASILY LISTED ON MY STATUS AND THAT'S WHY [inaudible] SYNONYMIZED [inaudible] THE NAMES. RESEARCHERS THAT THE REAL PRIVACY FORUM. WITH FOUR WERE A FEW YEARS AGO THAT KIND OF EXPLAINS THIS IS SPECTRUM OF THE THE PHONE FULLY ON THEM. PERSONAL DATA TOOL FOR THE ANONYMIZED DATA AND THIS IS LIKE IT IS A LIKE A DEGREE OF GRACE RIGHT. THE ONE THING THAT I WANTED TO THIRTY FIVE FROM THE EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE IS THAT EUROPE DOESN'T PROHIBIT THE SALE OF THE THERE. IS DESPERATE HE WAS THE SALE OF THE THE FOR UNETHICAL PURPOSES ONE GOOD EXAMPLE THAT I COULD OFFER IS FOR EXAMPLE WHERE. WE MIGHT WANT TO HIRE SERVICE THAT LETS US KNOW THAT OUR INFORMATION HAS BEEN COMPROMISED ONLINE FOR THAT SERVICE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE US THE INFORMATION THEY TYPICALLY WILL HAVE TO GO. TO A COMPANY THAT SPECIALIZES IN COLLECTING USE OF THE THAT AND THEY WILL BE ALLOW AND THERE ARE YOU FEELING ALSO IT'S NOT THERE'S NO BLANKET PROHIBITION AGAINST SLES. UNDER THE EUROPEAN REGINA. THANK YOU I THINK AT THIS POINT. OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE THE DEVIL'S ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS HERE MAYBE IF YOU DOUBLES -- BUT CERTAINLY THANK YOU FOR SORT OF SETTING THE STAGE FOR SETTING THE TABLE ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES SOME OF THE PRACTICAL -- PROBLEMS WE OBVIOUSLY ARE GOING TO LOOK AT TIGHTENING -- THIS UP NOBODY WANTS TO INHIBIT. INNOVATION ON THE OTHER HAND WE DO HAVE PRIVACY RIGHTS THAT WE WANT TO PROTECT AS WELL SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND TO APPRECIATE THE THE INSIDE TO PROVIDE WITH US TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. OUR NEXT PANEL -- WE ARE GOING -- TO LOOK AT A STAKEHOLDER INSIGHTS. ON THE STATE OF THE CCPA WILL HAVE SERRA BOOT WHO IS THE POLICY ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. AND MARINE MAHONEY WHO IS A POLICY ANALYST WITH CONSUMER REPORTS WE ARE NOT MOVING WITH THE ALACRITY I'D HOPED SO IF WE COULD KEEP YOU EACH TO TEN MINUTES ON YOUR COMMENTS. IT WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT AND WE'LL START WITH MS PUT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M SERRA -- TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF CAL CHAMBER IF YOU WOULD SPEAK INTO THE MICROPHONE SO THIS IS. ALSO AVAILABLE TO FOLKS AT HOME TO THANK YOU YES WE REPRESENT CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES ACROSS EVERY INDUSTRY INCLUDING OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES. AS YOU KNOW CCPA PASTOR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN JUST ONE WEEK. DUE TO THE IMPENDING DEADLINE TO REMOVE THE INITIATIVE FROM THE BALLOT. THERE WAS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DIVERSE STATE COURT HOLDER INPUT AND THE RESULT IS A LOT THAT CAN BE CONFUSING AND THAT PRESENTS SOME SERIOUS PRIVACY CONCERNS AN OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES. LAST JUNE WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED TO THE FACT THAT IT NEEDS FIXES WAS NOT CONTROVERSIAL THE AUTHORS NOTED THERE WOULD NEED TO BE SOME FIXES IN NUMEROUS LEGISLATORS SIGNED ON TO A LETTER STATING THAT WHILE THE AGREED WITH THE BILL'S EXPANSION OF PRIVACY RIGHTS. THEY WERE CONCERNED WITH HOW QUICKLY IT PASSED AND EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON REASONABLE FIXES GOING FORWARD. UNFORTUNATELY SINCE THERE THAT TIME THERE'S BEEN A NARRATIVE THAT ANY CHANGES TO THIS LAW ARE. REQUESTED BY BUSINESS WOULD BE ROLLING ACK PRIVACY RIGHTS BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE. AND THE NARRATIVE THAT THIS LAW ONLY APPLIES TO BIG TACK AND DATA BROKERS ISN'T TRUE EITHER. IT'S EASY PAY APPLIES TO A THIRD VERY BROAD CATEGORY BUSINESSES ANY BUSINESS CITY ANNUALLY RECEIVES THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF FIFTY THOUSAND OR MORE CONSUMERS HOUSEHOLDS OR DEVICES. IT TURNS OUT FIFTY THOUSAND PIECES OF DATA IS NOT A LOT. GIVEN THAT ONE CONSUMER CAN BE COUNTED MULTIPLE TIMES AND GIVEN THE C. C. P.'S BROAD DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WHICH INCLUDES IP ADDRESSES AND SO MUCH MORE. FOR EXAMPLE THE CCP APPLIES TO BUSINESSES WITH FIFTY THOUSAND WEBSITE VISITORS PER YEAR. IF THE BUSINESS HAS AN AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN UNIQUE ONLINE VISITORS PER DAY IT WILL HIT THAT THRESHOLD. AND JUST THINK OF ALL THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT EASILY CAN TODAY WHICH IS ABOUT TWELVE TRANSACTIONS PER HOUR IN A TWELVE HOUR DAY YOU GOT CONVENIENCE STORES COFFEE SHOPS RESTAURANTS THERE ARE VERY MANY. THE POINT IS THAT THE CZ P. A. COVERS. DIVERSITY OF BUSINESSES AND TREATS THEM ALL THE SAME IS A HANDFUL OF LARGE TECH GIANTS IN THE STATE. SO PLEASE KEEP THAT DIVERSITY OF BUSINESS AND MINE IS OUTLINED ARE CONCERNED STAY IN PLEASE KEEP AN OPEN MIND. I'M GONNA START BY DISCUSSING FIVE FIX IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT CONSUMER DATA SECURITY PRIVACY AND CHOICE. FIRST THE CCPA REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION THE BUSINESSES COLLECTED AFTER RECEIVING A CONSUMER REQUEST. BUT SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION IS NOT DEFINED IT COULD MEAN BUSINESSES MUST TRANSMIT HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION BACK TO CONSUMERS LIKE CREDIT CARDS. OR SPECIFIC INTERNET SEARCHES INFORMATION CONSUMERS ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THEMSELVES. THIS WOULD CREATE A RISK OF FRAUDSTERS POSING AS THE CONSUMER TO GET ACCESS TO THIS DATA. TO ALLEVIATE THIS RISK A BUSINESS MAY NEED TO COLLECT EVEN MORE INFORMATION FROM THE REQUESTING CONSUMER. TO BE SURE IT IS SENDING SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO THE RIGHT PERSON ESPECIALLY WHEN A BUSINESS HAS NO DIRECT CONSUMER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CONSUMER. THIS RUNS COUNTER TO PRIVACY GOALS AND COULD GREATLY HARM CONSUMERS WE'RE REQUESTING AS THE CPA AMENDMENT TO LIMIT THESE RISKS SECOND THE C. C. P.'S REFERENCES TO HOUSEHOLDS AND DEVICES AND THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ALSO PRESENT SERIOUS RISKS. AS DRAFTED ONE MEMBER OF A HOUSEHOLD WHETHER THERE AND USE A SPOUSE OR ROOMMATE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL THE SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION INCLUDING CREDIT CARD INFORMATION -- YOU LOCATION DATA ABOUT ANOTHER MEMBER OF THEIR TO SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION FROM A GROCERY STORE DELIVERY SERVICE THEREBY EXPOSING ANOTHER HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS PURCHASE OF SENSITIVE ITEMS LIKE. A PREGNANCY TEST. SIMILARLY ONE USER OF A DEVICE CAN REQUEST ALL THE SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION THE COMPANY HAS ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR DEVICE WHICH COULD REVEAL PRIVATE THINGS ABOUT ANOTHER USER OF THAT DEVICE. THE INCLUSION OF HOUSEHOLDS AND DEVICES COULD ALSO INFRINGE ON THE CHOICES OF OTHERS FOR EXAMPLE IF ONE HOUSEHOLD MEMBER MAKES A REQUEST TO DELETE ALL DATA ASSOCIATED WITH HOUSEHOLD. ANOTHER HOUSEHOLD MEMBER WOULD BE SUBSEQUENTLY UNABLE TO ACCESS THEIR INFORMATION. THIRD. THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IS INCREDIBLY OVER BROAD IF NOT ADJUSTED IT WILL UNDERMINE EXISTING PRIVACY PROTECTIVE PRACTICES. AND IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL COSTS ON BUSINESSES MEANT MOST PEOPLE THINK OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IS DATA THAT COULD IDENTIFY SOMEONE LIKE BIRTHDATES OR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. THE CZ PA DEFINES PERSONAL INFORMATION FAR MORE BROADLY AS INFORMATION THAT YES IDENTIFIES BUT ALSO THAT RELATES TO DESCRIBES IS CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH OR COULD REASONABLY BE LINKED TO A PARTICULAR CONSUMER HOUSEHOLD. ODDLY THIS DEFINITION CREATES A REASONABLE STANDARD FOR DATA THAT CAN BE LINKED TO A PERSON -- HOUSEHOLD BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE THE SAME ALLOWANCE OF REASONABLENESS FOR DATA THAT IS CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. AS A PRACTICAL MATTER THIS MEANS PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE C. CPA IS ANY INFORMATION THAT COULD IN THEORY BE ASSOCIATED WITH A PERSON OR HOUSEHOLD. LET'S PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT IF I HAVE AN ONLINE ACCOUNT WITH THE STORE AND EXERCISE MY RIGHTS UNDER THE SEA CPA. THAT STORE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ME WITH MY COUNTY TELLS OUR TO DELETE THEM. BUT THAT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING OF WHAT BUSINESS IS REQUIRED TO STORES WEBSITE OR PHILLIP SHOPPING CARTS WITHOUT LOGGING IN. AND THAT STORE KEEPS I. P. ADDRESSES TO TRACK HOW CONSUMERS USE OUR WEBSITE BUT IT DOESN'T LINK THAT DATA BACK. TO A PERSON UNDER THE SEA CPA THE STORE COULD BE REQUIRED TO SEARCH FOR EVERY POSSIBLE I. P. ADDRESS THAT THEY COULD IN THAT THEY HAVE THAT COULD IN THEORY BE LINKED BACK TO ME. SIMILARLY IF I MADE A PURCHASE INSIDE THEIR BRICK AND MORTAR STORE THEY COULD BE REQUIRED TO SEARCH SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE TO FIND OUT WHERE I APPEAR ON IT. THE ONLY WAY FOR BUSINESSES TO COMPLY WOULD BE TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH THEIR BUSINESS AND STORE THAT INFORMATION TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE WHICH WOULD BE HUGELY WASTEFUL AND HARMFUL TO CONSUMER PRIVACY. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WAS THE RESULT INTENDED THE LAW HAS AN EXEMPTION STATING THAT A BUSINESS IS NOT REQUIRED TO RE LINK DATA. THAT IS NOT MAINTAINED IN A MANNER THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED PERSONAL INFORMATION BUT UNDER THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BASICALLY ALL DATA IS PERSONAL INFORMATION SO -- AS DRAFTED THE EXEMPTION DOESN'T PROVIDE RELIEF AND IT SHOULD BE FIXED. FINALLY ALTHOUGH THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IS PRETTY ALL ENCOMPASSING THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF DATA THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT MEANT TO BE PERSONAL INFORMATION UNDER THE LAW. AGGREGATE DATA DE IDENTIFIED DATA AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA. BUT EVEN THESE EXEMPTIONS NEED ADJUSTMENTS TO BE MEANINGFUL UNDER THE DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED ONLY AGGREGATE DATA COULD EVER QUALIFIES DE IDENTIFIED WHICH WOULD DISCOURAGE BUSINESSES FROM USING THIS PRIVACY PROTECTED PRACTICE. ADDITIONALLY THE DEFINITION OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION IS LIMITED TO GOVERNMENT RECORDS BUT THEN IT'S FURTHER RESTRICTED TO SUCH RECORDS THAT ARE USED FOR A PURPOSE THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS MAINTAINING THAT DATA. ASIDE FROM BEING CONFUSING ENOUGH INVITING UNNECESSARY LITIGATION. THIS RESTRICTIONS ON CONSTITUTIONAL LIMIT ON FREE SPEECH AND IT SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE LAW [inaudible] FOURTH. CONFUSING LANGUAGE IN THE NONDISCRIMINATION SECTION RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT THE LEGALITY OF LOYALTY AND REWARDS PROGRAMS OFFERED BY RETAILERS GROCERS HOTELS AIRLINES AND OTHERS. CONSUMERS LOVE THESE PROGRAMS IN FACT 80% OF AMERICANS BELONG TO AT LEAST. ONE WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT IS THAT BUSINESSES CAN CONTINUE TO OFFER THEM UNLESS THE SECTIONS CLARIFIED IT'LL BE UP TO THE COURTS TO DETERMINE THE FTE OF THESE PROGRAMS AND THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY. FIFTH THE CCPA ALSO NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED TO PREVENT BAD ACTORS FROM OPTING OUT OF DATA SERVICES USED EMPLOYMENT CRUCIAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS TO PREVENT IDENTITY THEFT AND MONEY LAUNDERING. I'M NOW GOING TO DISCUSS TO AREAS OF THIS LAW THAT WILL LEAD TO UNNECESSARY COMPLIANCE COSTS FOR BUSINESSES AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IF NOT FIXED. FIRST THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER IS ANY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT AND WITHOUT CLARIFICATION THAT COULD BE INTERPRETED TO INCLUDE EMPLOYEES. THE OPERATIONAL COSTS FOR BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY SMALL BUSINESSES INCLUDING EMPLOYEES AND JOB APPLICANTS WILL BE EXORBITANT. IMAGINE A FAMILY OWNED RESTAURANT THAT SERVES A HUNDRED FIFTY SING THIS DEFINITION IT MAY HAVE TO OPERATE OPERATIONALIZE. THE CCPA FOR ITS KITCHEN AND WAIT STAFF AND A BUSINESS WITH HIGH TURNOVER AND LOW PROFIT MARGINS. ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT IS ALREADY ESTABLISHING CALIFORNIA LAW BUT THE CCPA WOULD ALLOW A SEPARATED SPOUSE WHO'S PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD TO GAIN ACCESS TO PAYROLL RECORDS. I CAN'T BE WITH THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED. THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER IS ALSO PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IT INCLUDES BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES IN THE CONTEXT OF BUSINESS TO BUSINESS INTERACTIONS. SO FOR EXAMPLE A SMALL MEDICAL PRACTICE THAT ALREADY COMPLIES WITH HIP A FOR PATIENT DATA WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HONOR OPT OUT AND DELETION REQUESTS FROM SUPPLIERS WITH WHOM THE EMAIL FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES. WE NEVER HAVE ACCESS TO PATIENT DATA. IF NOT FIXED THIS WILL LEAD TO UNFORTUNATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. SECOND I TARGETED ONLINE ADVERTISING IS ANOTHER AREA CCPA WAS NOT INTENDED TO IMPACT. HOWEVER THE CURRENT LANGUAGE LACKS CLARITY. ONLINE ADVERTISING IS A PRIVACY PROTECTED PRACTICE IN WHICH NO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INTERNET ECOSYSTEM DEPENDS ON IT FROM SMALL BLOGS TO LARGE PUBLICATIONS INCLUDING OUR FAVORITE NEWSPAPERS. AND BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES. DEPEND ON US ADVERTISING NETWORK TO REACH CONSUMERS IT'S AN IMPORTANT AREA WE NEED TO CLARIFY. FINALLY I WILL ADDRESS ENFORCEMENT. THE CZ EIGHTY CZ PA CREATES AN ONEROUS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS TO BUSINESSES THAT HAVE SUFFERED A DATA BREACH NO PROOF OF INJURY IS REQUIRED IN THE MINIMUM STATUTORY DAMAGES AWARDED COULD PUT FOLKS OUT OF BUSINESS. THERE SHOULD BE A SAFE HARBOR FOR BUSINESSES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED RECOGNIZED SECURITY STANDARDS BUT THERE ISN'T. AND DESPITE THIS AND DESPITE THE OTHER FLAWS WITH THIS LAW THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ENCOURAGE LEGISLATORS TO VOTE FOR IT WHICH RESULTED IN THE UNANIMOUS VOTE WE DID THIS BECAUSE WE HOPE WE COULD FIX SOME OF THE PROBLEMS I'VE MENTIONED. AND BECAUSE THE P. R. A. WAS LIMITED SINCE OF THE LAW. LAS COMPLICATED IT CAN BE CONFUSING IT'S NOT FINISHED AND APPLIES TO BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES AND I'VE BEEN ON CALLS WITH PRIVACY EXPERTS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO DISAGREE ON WHAT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THIS LONG MEAN. WE SHOULD NOT EXTEND THE P. R. EIGHT HAVE TRIAL ATTORNEYS AND FORCE MORE OF THIS LAW WHICH HAS BEEN PULLED FROM A REGULATORY MODEL THE VIEWS AS WE'VE SEEN WITH PAGO WOULD PALE IN COMPARISON. IN CLOSING LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE JUST PASSED MOST ROBUST PRIVACY LAW IN THIS COUNTRY. COMPLIANCE WITH THIS LAW WILL BE INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE WE DON'T YET KNOW THE IMPACT THIS WILL HAVE ON OUR ECONOMY OR HOW IT COULD RAISE PRICES ON CONSUMERS AND THESE ARE CRUCIAL FACTORS LEGISLATORS NEED TO CONSIDER. BEFORE ADDING EVEN MORE ONEROUS BURDENS ON TOP OF THE CPA. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. MS MAHONEY IF YOU WOULD THANK YOU. THANK YOU TURN JACKSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS MAUREEN MAHONEY AND I'M A POLICY ANALYST FOCUSING ON PRIVACY IN TECH ISSUES WORKING OUT OF CONSUMER REPORTS SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE. CONSUMER REPORTS IS AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT MEMBER ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING SIX MILLION CONSUMERS NATIONWIDE. WORKING SIDE BY SIDE WITH CONSUMERS TO CREATE A FAIR SAY FOR MARKET PLACE. IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY IN TECH FINANCIAL SERVICES -- FOOD PRODUCTS SAFETY AND AND I TRUST AMONG OTHER ISSUES WE TEST THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS EVERY YEAR INCLUDING EVALUATE MEAN COMPANIES -- DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY PRACTICES AND WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF ADVOCATING FOR STRONGER PRIVACY LAWS. NATIONALLY IN CITIES ACROSS COUNTRY AND ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA. CONSUMER REPORTS COMMANDS CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS FOR PASSING THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACTS WE APPRECIATE THAT THIS LAW ADVANCES CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT WAYS. INCREASING TRANSPARENCY -- PROVIDING THE RIGHT TO ACCESS TO LEADS AND THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF THEIR INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES. AND SUCH A SOLUTION IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. HOWEVER THE DISCUSSION SURROUNDING THE CCPA HAS BEEN TOO FOCUSED ON WORK ABILITY FOR BUSINESSES AND NOT ENOUGH ON WORK ABILITY FOR CONSUMERS. FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATION PUTS A LOT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY ON THE CONSUMER TO IDENTIFY ALL OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE COLLECTING INFORMATION AND SELLING INFORMATION. ABOUT THEM AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO OPT YOU WILL BE TOO BURDENSOME FOR MANY IF NOT MOST CONSUMERS. INSTEAD PRIVACY SHOULD BE. IT SURE BY THE DEFAULT AT THE VERY LEAST TO SEE CPA SHOULD EXPLICITLY PROVIDE FOR GLOBAL OPT OUTS -- FOR EXAMPLE PLATFORM LEVEL DO NOT TRACK INSTRUCTIONS THAT COMPANY SHOULD BE OBLIGATED TO HONOR. CONSUMERS ALSO NEED DATA MINIMIZATION WHEN WE SAY DATA MINIMIZATION AND WE MEAN THAT LIMITING DATA COLLECTION TO THAT WHICH IS NECESSARY TO OPERATE THE SERVICE -- CONSUMERS ALSO NEED GREATER CONTROL OVER DATA SHARING. ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION SOLD AND THE THIRD PARTIES TO WHOM THAT SPECIFIC INFORMATION IS OLD. THAT'S WHY WE JOINED OVER THIRTY ADVOCACY GROUPS IN SUPPORTING ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEEKS IS AB SEVENTEEN SIXTEEN WOULD WHICH WOULD ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. NO REASONABLE PERSON WOULD WANT THE MOST SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THEM SOLD TO STRANGERS WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND COMPANY SHOULD BE. REQUIRED TO HONOR THAT AS A MATTER OF COURSE. IN ADDITION STRONG. IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THE COMPANY'S COMPLY. AND WE RECOGNIZE APPRECIATES THE CHAIRS EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN ENFORCEMENT UNDER THE CCA THROUGH SB. FIVE SIXTY ONE WE LEARNED WITH THE EQUIFAX DATA BREACH FOR EXAMPLE THAT DATA SECURITY REQUIREMENTS ARE MEANINGLESS WITHOUT STRONG ENFORCEMENT. WHAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE I COLFAX ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN REASONABLE SECURITY UNDER THE GRAMM LEACH BLILEY ACT AND THE SAFEGUARDS RULE? SHE'LL BE A PRIZE NO PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY. WHILE THE CITY PAYS PIRATE OF ACTION IN THE EVENT OF A NEGLIGENT DATA BREACH WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS INCENTIVIZING COMPANIES TO MAINTAIN REASONABLE SECURITY. WE ENFORCEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE PRIVACY PROVISIONS OF THE CC BE A NEED TO BE IMPROVED BEFORE IT GOES INTO EFFECT. IN TWENTY TWENTY FOR EXAMPLE BY ADDING A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO THE PRIVACY PROVISIONS REMOVING THAT THE THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE EASY PROVIDE INDIVIDUAL ADVICE TO COMPANIES WITH RESPECT TO COMPLIANCE. AND REMOVING THE RIGHT SECURE LANGUAGE WHICH WILL SUCK THE RESOURCES OF THE A TEAM. CONSUMERS WANT MORE NOT YOUR PROTECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE 92% OF CONSUMERS THINK THAT INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS SHOULD PROVIDE MORE CONTROL OVER THE SHARING OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION. MORE THAN HALF OF CONSUMERS DON'T TRUST SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES -- WITH THEIR WITH THEIR INFORMATION. AND RECENT SCANDALS INVOLVING THE ILLICIT SHARING OR SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHOUT CONSENSUS BASED ON THE FACE FOR CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA INCIDENT. REPORTS OF ON LOCATION TRACKING IN SALE FOR EXAMPLE BY THE WEATHER CHANNEL APP. REVEALED BROAD UNEASE ABOUT DATA SHARING. CLEARLY CONSUMERS BY OTHER DEVICES ARE CONNECTED PRODUCTS AND OTHER APPS AND SERVICES BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT THEIR INFORMATION IS PROTECTED. STRONG ENFORCEABLE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS ARE NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER BUT THIS AREA PRIOR TO THE IN AN ACT MANY CCPA HAS BEEN LARGELY UNREGULATED. TECH COMPANIES HAVE SOME TECH COMPANIES A BALLOONED INTO BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATIONS BASED ON THE MONETIZATION OF CONSUMER DATA WITH FEW PROTECTIONS OF OUR GUARD RAILS. THERE'S NO GENERAL ACROSS THE BOARD FEDERAL PRIVACY -- PRINTING SIMMERS BASELINE PROTECTIONS AND THE FEDERAL AGENCY ENTRUSTED WITH OVERSEEING THESE COMPANIES THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION IS UNDER RESOURCE AND UNDERSTAFFED. IS ALWAYS STATE ACTION SO IMPORTANT AND SHOULD NOT BE CHIPPED AWAY. BASELINE PROTECTIONS ANALOGOUS TO MEN ARE NEEDED SO CONSUMERS CAN SAFELY USE APPS -- ANOTHER ONLINE SERVICES WITHOUT HAVING TO COMPROMISE THEIR IN IN IN ALIENABLE RIGHTS TO PRIVACY UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THERE ARE TECHNICAL FIXES ON NEEDED TO THE CPA FOR EXAMPLE THE SPONSORS THEMSELVES HAVE POINTED TO DRAFTING AREAS THAT NEED TO BE CORRECTED. EXAMPLE THEY RECOMMEND IS STRIKING A PROVISION IN ONE CAN SEE THE GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT COMPANIES HAVE TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT CONSUMERS IN THEIR PRIVACY POLICIES. WHICH IS SPONSORED ASIDE IS NOT THEIR INTENT. AND TO THE EXTENT THE INDUSTRY'S CONCERNED THAT LEGITIMATE LOYALTY PROGRAMS SUCH AS THOSE THAT GIVE YOU ATTEND COFFEE FOR FREE WOULD BE HINDERED BY THE LEGISLATION. FOR THE COMPANIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO COLLECT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- IN ORDER TO TIE DATA TO AN INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER AND RESPOND TO ACCESS REQUESTS WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE THE AGE SHE MAKING IT MORE EXPLICIT THAT THIS IS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE LAW. BUT ANY DRAFTING ERRORS ARE TECHNICAL ISSUES CAN AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED ONLY WEIGHS THE MAINTAIN AND STREET THEN RATHER THAN ROLL BACK PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS. FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ACCESS REQUESTS WITH RESPECT TO DEVICE OR HOUSEHOLD LEVEL DATA COULD COMPROMISE PRIVACY. CONSUMERS WHEN I WENT THERE REMAINS ACCESSING THE BROWSING HISTORY FOR EXAMPLE. BY THE ANSWERS NOT NARROWING THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN THE CONSUMERS WOULD NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF THAT INFORMATION. TO THIRD PARTIES. INSTEAD ACCESS RATES MIGHT BE LIMITED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CONSUMER ONLY OBTAINS THEIR OWN DATA OR SOMEONE ELSE'S DATA WITH THEIR EX WAS AUTHORIZATION BUT OPT OUTS RATES SHOULD REMAIN. WILL HAVE NO OBJECTION TO CLEAR FIND THE BUSINESSES TO NOT HAVE TO GIVE OUT FINANCIAL ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND BIRTHDAYS SSNS OR OTHER INFORMATION. THAT COULD BE USED TO OPEN A FRAUDULENT ACCOUNT IN THE CONSUMER'S NAME. BUT MOSTLY US FROM INDUSTRY ARE TROJAN HORSE EFFORTS TO WATER DOWN OR WE CAN THE LAW. FOR EXAMPLE WE STRONGLY OPPOSE EFFORTS TO REMOVE ACCESS TO SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT A CONSUMER. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CONSUMERS KNOW THE EXACT. OF THEIR BROWSING HISTORY THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED THE SITES ARE VISITING THE INFERENCES THAT ARE DRAWN ABOUT THEM NOT JUST OF THE COMPANY'S MONITORING -- THE WRESTLING HISTORY. WE ALSO STRONGLY OPPOSE EFFORTS TO REMOVE PROTECTIONS RELATED TO FINANCIAL CENTERS PROGRAMS. AND TO EXPAND CARVE OUTS FOR TARGETED ADVERTISING -- WE OPPOSE THOSE THIS WOULD ELIMINATE IMPORT PROTECTIONS THAT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE GOALS LEGISLATION AND WE URGE YOU TO REJECT THEM. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH LAWMAKERS AND I GROUPS TO STRENGTHEN THESE PROTECTIONS AND WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU WILL CERTAINLY TWO DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE SAME. ISSUE AND I DID -- JUST WANT TO ASK -- MS MAHONEY ONE QUESTION -- THERE'S A CLAIM IT'S WHEN WE HEAR A LOT FROM THE CHAMBER ABOUT HOW SMALL BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED. WE HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT CLAIM WILL HARM SMALL BUSINESSES. WELL THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR US BECAUSE CONSUMER REPORTS VERY MUCH VALUES SMALL BUSINESS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. TO MAINTAIN A ROBUST ECOSYSTEM OF SMALL BUSINESSES TO HAVE -- CONSUMER CHOICE. IN THE MARKETPLACE -- AND THAT BEING SAID WE'RE DEALING WITH ISSUES OF PRIVACY SECURITY RELATED. TO CONSUMERS IN ANIMAL RIGHTS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION SO I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. ALL COMPANIES ARE ENTRUSTED WITH CONSUMERS PERSONAL INFORMATION BE REQUIRED TO PROTECT IT. AND KEEP IT SECURE AND I THINK IT THIS WAY PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO THE PRIVACY PROVISIONS THE REAL CONCERN IS THAT ENFORCEMENT -- JUST ISN'T ADEQUATE TO INCENTIVIZE COMPANY SUPPLIED ALL. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN. EVEN ASK A COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL -- SERRA IT YOU MENTIONED -- THAT THAT BUSINESS OUT OF THE GIVEN THE SAFE HARBOR -- WHICH I AGREE WITH THOUGH AND I ACTUALLY TOOK A PHOTOGRAPH OF MR ME TAGGART'SPRESENTATION BECAUSE CENTER DOT HAD A BILL ON THIS LAST YEAR. AND IT'S SPECIFICALLY SAID THAT -- CONSUMER FORCING WAS ONLY FOR NEGLIGENT DATA BREACHING HE SPECIFICALLY SAID DURING HIS PRESENTATION -- THAT -- DID YOU KNOW WE OUGHT NOT HAVE A SITUATION WHERE A BUSINESS DOES EVERYTHING IS POSTED TO DO WITH THIS. YOU KNOW HACKED BY THE RUSSIANS OR SOMETHING HUG SO HE I THINK YOU SEE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THAT CONCERN. AND BUILT IN -- SAFE HARBORS THREE KEY SAFE HARBORS AND AND AND AND INTO THE BILL AND ALSO. IN -- MADE SURE THAT -- THAT SAID THERE WAS CONSERVE YOU KNOW THAT THAT DID THE DID IN FORTUNATELY KICKED IN WITH NEGLIGENT. WAIT WITH IT WITH A FINDING OF NEGLIGENCE SO I JUST WANTED. TO CLARIFY WHAT AT WHAT I SENSE WAS SOME DISCREPANCY BETWEEN YOUR YOUR TESTIMONIES. THE LINE NEED THE LOCKER AS IT'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT -- THAT IT WOULD EXCLUDE ENFORCEMENT IF YOUR DATA IS ENCRYPTED OR IF IT'S REACTIVE. THAT NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED BUT EVEN IF YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY STILL PLENTY OF INSTANCES WHERE THERE COULD BE AN EMPLOYEE AIR THAT LEADS. TO A BREACH OF THESE THINGS. IT COULD HAPPEN AND THE CONCERN ABOUT THE LAW THE WAY IT IS RIGHT NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS THE FACT THAT. LIABILITIES SO GREAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE A MINIMUM OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS MAXIMUM SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER PERSON PER INCIDENT. SO WHEN YOU HAVE A BREACH LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING AT AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT MOST COMPANIES ARE GOING TO ROLL THE DICE PEOPLE TO EXPLAIN TO A JURY YOU KNOW. WHY WHAT THEY DID WAS REASONABLE IT'S COULD BE PERCEIVED AS A MOVING TARGET? AND SO OUR BIG CONCERN IS JUST THAT IT'S GOING TO BE -- YOU KNOW TOO ONEROUS IT'S JUST GOING TO LEAD TO A LOT MORE SETTLEMENTS IS NOT TO DO ANYTHING TO MAKE CONSUMER SAFER. YEAH I DID ALL I I JUST WITH WITH RESPECT I REMEMBER WHEN SENATOR DODD'S BILL CAME UP IN SOME YEAH BUSINESS FOLKS ARE RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT IT AND I I I SHARE THE THE CONCERN THAT. THE STREET GLIDE BILLETS THERE WASN'T FAIR. AND AND TALKING. TO FOLKS LIKE YOU AND OTHERS REPRESENT THE CHAMBER THERE WAS A KIND OF COMMON SENSE IS THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE AT A NEGLIGENCE STANDARD THAT WAS THE FAIR WAY OF HANDLING WHAT SENATE I WAS TRYING TO DO. WELL IF IF I MAY CENTER -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IS THE WOMEN'S GROUP WE TALK INTO THE MICROPHONE SORRY COURSE THANK YOU. WHEN WITH RESPECT TO THAT LINE WITH A SOME MORE TALKING ABOUT A SAFE HARBOR WHAT WERE WHAT WERE? WOULD BE HOPING FOR IN THIS SITUATION WOULD BE SOMETHING AKIN TO THE OHIO LAW THAT RECENTLY PASSED WHERE FOR COMPANY CAN PROVE EARLIER ON IN THE LITIGATION THAT THEY HAVE CONFORMED. TO YOU KNOW RECORD NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED OUR STATE RECOGNIZED SECURITY STANDARDS. AND THEY STILL GOT HACKED ANYWAY THAT THEY COULD BE OFF THE HOOK FOR THAT ONEROUS -- YOU KNOW THOSE HONOR STATUTORY DAMAGES. EVEN IF VERY EVEN IF THE EVEN IF THERE WASN'T A LEGEND SOME NEGLIGENCE IS A WELL IT JUST IT'S A WAY TO RESOLVE LITIGATION EARLIER AND TO NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THE EXORBITANT COSTS OF EDISCOVERY YOU KNOW FOR A BIGGER COMPANY YOU'RE TALKING LIKE IT HER THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR EDISCOVERY AND SO WHAT WE'RE JUST WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT COMPANIES ANY LEVERAGE INTO IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT WHETHER THEY HAVE A GOOD ARGUMENT OR NOT. CONSIDERING HOW ONEROUS THE LIABILITY IS. WE HEAR THIS ARGUMENT ALL THE TIME FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IT DOESN'T LIKE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO ENFORCE THE RIGHTS THE THOUGHT THE THOUGHT OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR DISCOVERY. WITH A COMPANY LIKE APPLE OR GOOGLE IS KIND OF LAUGHABLE THEY PROBABLY SPENT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THEIR OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY IN MOUNTAIN VIEW SO -- THAT -- I DON'T THINK THAT ARGUMENT HOLDS MUCH WATER BUT BUT CENTER ALLEN YEAH SO THAT I'M CERTAINLY MISS IN GETTING THAT -- BACK BETTER CLARIFY YOU MAYBE IT'S A QUESTION OF MAKING SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THE LAW DOESN'T ALLOW FOR WHAT ARE TRULY FISHING EXPEDITIONS BUT THAT THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY -- FOR FOR FOLKS WHO ACTED NEGLIGENTLY TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW AT LEAST WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF SENATOR DODD BILL WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WAS A GOOD STANDARD. ON THE OTHER QUESTION I WANT TO ASK YOU. I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CONSUMER IS DEFINED AS AN ACTUAL PERSON. I AM SO THAT ELISE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THIS IT WOULDN'T APPLY TO BUSINESS TO BUSINESS INTERACTIONS AND I I THINK YOU. IMPLIED THAT A MAYBE I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING ALL THE APPLICATIONS FOR CONSUMER IS YES A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT BUT IT COULD BE A PERSON IT'S ACTING IN THEIR CAPACITY AS SOMEBODY REPRESENTING A BUSINESS. AND SO YOU CAN HAVE A SITUATION WHERE TWO COMPANIES AREN'T INTO ENGAGING IN A TRANSACTION ONE COMPANIES DOING DUE DILIGENCE ON ANOTHER THEY'RE HAVING TO DEAL WITH EACH OTHER. AND ONE PERSON CAN SAY HEY. GIVE ME ALL THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE ON YOUR DELETE MY INFORMATION IF THEY IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG IN THE BUSINESS DEAL IS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE THEY THINK THE OTHER EXAMPLE I GAVE WAS. JUST THAT YOU COULD HAVE YOU KNOW A SUPPLIER THAT WANTS TO MESS WITH SOMEBODY SAY HEY GIVE ME ALL THIS INFORMATION IT'S JUST A WHOLE IT'S THE POINT IS IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS NEVER CONTEMPLATED BY THIS THIS LAW WAS INTENDED TO COVER TRUE CONSUMERS -- AND IT'S JUST THE CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING CONSUMER BE DEFINED SO BROADLY. THE CAR IS IN IT DOES THE IS IS THAT EVEN LOOKING THIS ISSUE AT ALL OF OF THE DEFINITION CONSUMER MARIE. IS -- YEAH YEAH AS THAT THEY'VE I MEAN DO YOU THINK OF THIS IN THE CAN YOU WORKED OUT WITH THE THE ADVOCATES. THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT -- MORE OPPOSED TO CHANGING THE DEFINITION OF A CONSUMER BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT CONSUMERS YOU KNOW ACTING IN IN THE CAPACITIES EMPLOYEES MIGHT LOSE -- IMPORTANT CONSUMER. PROTECTIONS -- BUT IF THERE ARE YOU KNOW PROBLEMS OF WITH IMPLEMENTATION THE COME UP THAT END UP ACTUALLY HURTING I'M CONSUMER PRIVACY -- THEN PERHAPS A TAILOR FIX MAY BE CONSIDERED YES COULD YOU SPECIFICALLY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- AN EMPLOYEE. DESERVE REAL TRULY ACTING AS A AS A AS AN AGENT OF THE BUSINESS AS OPPOSED. TO ACTIONS IMAGE I I I WOULD I WOULD THINK TO THIS COULD BE RECONCILED. I'M SORRY OH NO I'M SO SORRY IF I MAY UM YEAH IT'S TWO SEPARATE ISSUES WITH CONSUMER ONE IS THE EMPLOYEE CONTACTS AND ONE IS THAT USINESS TO BUSINESS ISSUE THAT WE JUST DISCUSSED AND IN THE CONTEXT OF EMPLOYEES. WE WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW LANGUAGE WE THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CONSUMER. WHO HAS A LIKE A? CUSTOMER CONSUMER RELATIONSHIP WITH A COMPANY AND AND THEN YOU KNOW SEPARATE THAT OUT FROM IF THEY HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT SAME COMPANY. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN AND PUTTING GUARDRAILS AROUND IF IT THE DATA FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN EMPLOYMENT RELATED PURPOSES. OKAY THAT SHOULDN'T BE COVERED WE REALLY TRY TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE ASKS THAT WE'RE MAKING HERE AND REALLY LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH FOLKS ON LANGUAGE TO ACHIEVE THEM. AS SENATOR ALLEN AND I COULD IF I COULD DIRECT TO PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE THE BACKGROUND PAPER -- IT DOES SHE A REFERENCE THIS -- THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED ON BUSINESSES DO NOT RESTRICT THE BUSINESSES ABILITY TO DO AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POINTS OUT THERE SO -- THAT TO HOPEFULLY. GET SOME CLARIFICATION TO WHAT IS AND IS NOT INCLUDED SO THAT WERE THERE SOME. YOU KNOW SOME ISSUES HERE THAT AND MISTER TAGGER TECHNOLOGIES AND BUT IT WILL BE -- EXTRAORDINARILY DETRIMENTAL TO MOVING THIS ISSUE FORWARD IF WE TRY TO CRAWL UNDER EVERY ROCK. I THINK MOST THIS IS COVERED IN A WIN MISTER MCTAGGART TO SPOKE AT HI I'M NOT SURE YOU WERE HERE BUT HE GAVE SORT OF VIA THE CLARIFICATIONS AND OF THE ANALYSES OF HOW THIS ALL CAME ABOUT SO. THE FACT THAT IT OCCURRED WITH ONE WEEK BEFORE THE END THE SESSION I THINK HE CLARIFIED AS WELL -- THAT THIS WAS AN ONGOING EFFORT THAT TOOK MANY YEARS SHE PROBABLY SPENT THE LIKE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY ON ATTORNEYS FEES AND AND OTHER THINGS SO THAT THIS WASN'T TO FLY BY NIGHT EFFORT SAID THIS -- CLEARLY WELL THOUGHT OUT IN IN COMPROMISES WERE MADE IS WE SEE HAPPENED WITH A LOT OF LEGISLATION YEAH I MEAN THE ARGUMENT THEY'RE MAKING THEM IS THAT. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TIME THEY MADE A DEAL -- AND DAY NOW ONCE OF FIXES -- AND I MEAN IT IT'S AN ENGINE YEAH SO I NEEDED IN YOUR RIGHT YOU DID. ASK FOLK YOU SUPPORTED THE BILL -- WHEN IT CAME UP -- I AM INTERESTED IN IF EITHER OF YOU HAVE KIND OF THOUGHTS ON THE REFERENDUM NEGOTIATION PROCESS -- HAVING GONE THROUGH THIS LAST YEAR YOU KNOW WHETHER WHAT THE LEGISLATURE I TO ME HOW HOW WE GOT IT WHAT LESSONS ARE TO BE LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE. WITH YOU KNOW BUT I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS LOOK AT THIS AS AN EXAMPLE OF OF THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY THE SERVICE IN THE STEINBERG SET UP IS ACTUALLY WORKING DECENTLY WELL BUT IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH. IT LEFT SOME PEOPLE WANTING THOUGH BECAUSE EVERY BILL ALWAYS DOES SO ON SENATOR COULD I SUGGEST IT'S A GOOD QUESTION BUT WE STILL HAVE THREE MORE PANELS TO GO AND AND I KNOW WE LIKE TO WAX PHILOSOPHICAL PERHAPS WE COULD HAVE THE CONVERSATION AFTERWARDS -- UNLESS OR ANY OTHER SPECIFIC I'D LIKE TO THANK THE PANEL FOR PARTICIPATING Q. AND APPRECIATE THE THE ADVOCATES -- INSIGHTS INTO THIS AS WELL THANK YOU. OUR NEXT -- SPEAKER IS STACEY SURE SIR -- THE SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH THE CONSUMER LAW DIVISION THE PRIVACY UNIT FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHO WILL TALK ABOUT THE ROLE. OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. REGULATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT I GUESS THIS AFTERNOON WAS THE SIXTH AND FINAL HEARING THAT TE AGE SHE IS BEEN CONDUCTING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO TRY TO GET PUBLIC INPUT IN THE PREPARATION OF THOSE REGULATIONS WITH WHICH HE WAS TASKED OF UNDER THIS LAW. SENATOR I BELIEVE IT WAS THE SEVENTH THE SEVENTH PARDON ME EVENT SEVEN HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AS SENATOR JACKSON INTRODUCED ME MY NAME IS STACY SASSER I AM SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE AIR TO SYRIA. THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT THIS YOU SEE PA. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROMULGATING REGULATIONS AND ENFORCING THIS NEW CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW. AND WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY ENGAGED WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS A CONSIDERS MODIFICATIONS TO THE LAW. I'M HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS TWO COMPONENTS OF THE AGES WORK ON THAT THE CPA. MY TESTIMONY TODAY WILL LARGELY TRACK THE TESTIMONY I GAVE DURING THE FEBRUARY TWENTIETH INFORMATIONAL HEARING BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE. ON PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION NOT REMARKS AND LAID OF QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS THAT AROSE DURING THAT HEARING. FIRST I WILL PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH AN UPDATE ON OUR RULE MAKING ACTIVITIES. SECOND I WANT TO DISCUSS THE AGES POLICY CONCERNS REGARDING THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE CCPA AS OUTLINED IN ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. AUGUST TWENTY SECOND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN LETTER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO AND TO SENATOR HERTZBERG THE AUTHORS OF AB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE THESE CONCERNS ARE THE BASIS OF SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY ONE THE CHAIRS BILL INTRODUCED LAST WEEK THAT RESPONSE TO THE OFFICES CONCERNS ABOUT THE CCPA. AS PART OF MY TESTIMONY TODAY I ALSO RENEW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REQUEST FOR RESOURCES AND FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR RULE MAKING DEADLINES AND SUSTAINED VIGOROUS OVERSIGHT AND EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT. OF THE PRIVACY RIGHTS AFFORDED BY THE CCPA. AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO THANK THE CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO AND SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR MAKING A COMMITMENT LAST YEAR. TO HELP DOJ WITH ITS CCPA FUNDING NEEDS WE THANK THEM THE MEMBER OF THIS THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. THE SPEAKER PRO TEM AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR PROVIDING DOJ WITH TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN FUNDING. PURSUANT TO ELEVEN TWENTY ONE WHO SENATOR DODD WHO IS IN THE ROOM BEFORE. OUR OFFICE MUST PROMULGATE C. C. P. REGULATIONS BY JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE ON CCPA THAT ARE SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR DURING THIS SESSION. MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET THIS DEADLINE. SINCE JANUARY EIGHTH TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAVE BEEN HOLDING PUBLIC FORUMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS PART OF OUR PRELIMINARY ACTIVITIES IN THE RULE MAKING PROCESS. WE HAVE HOPE HELD SIX FORMS TO DATE SAN FRANCISCO SAN DIEGO RIVERSIDE LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO IN FRESNO AND OUR LAST FORM IS BEING HELD TODAY WHILE WE SPEAK AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. EACH FORM FOLLOWS THE SAME FORMAT WE PROVIDE A BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF OUR OFFICES WORK AN OVERVIEW OF THE RULE MAKING PROCESS AS SET FORTH IN THE CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT OR THE EPA. AND VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH STAKEHOLDERS AND CONSUMERS CAN SUBMIT COMMENTS TO OUR OFFICE FOR CONSIDERATION DURING THIS PRE WILL MAKING STAGE. PURSUANT TO THE EXPRESS LANGUAGE IN CCPA FOUND IN CIVIL CODE SECTION SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT. ONE EIGHT FIVE THE GOALS OF THESE FORMS HAVE BEEN TO SOLICIT BROAD PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND ENCOURAGE THE PUBLIC TO COMMENT ON WHAT THESE REGULATIONS SHOULD ADDRESS. WE ALSO SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHT A LIST OF SEVEN TOPICS AT THAT FOURTH IN THAT SECTION. AND REQUEST PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE SECIFIC AREAS BECAUSE THEY REFLECT WHAT WE ARE PRIORITIZING WITH REGARD TO THE JULY TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE. AND SO THE WITH THE CPA WILL BE WORKABLE FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS ALIKE. IN BRIEF THE SEVEN TOPICS ARE WHETHER THE REGULATIONS SHOULD ADDRESS NUMBER ONE THE CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. NUMBER TWO THE DEFINITION OF POP UP AGAIN -- THREE ANY EXCEPTIONS THAT SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED TO COMPLY WITH STATE OR FEDERAL LAW. NUMBER FOUR HOW CONSUMERS CAN SUBMIT A REQUEST TO OPT OUT FOR THE SALE PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOW THE BUSINESS SHOULD COMPLY WITH THAT OPT OUT REQUEST. NUMBER FIVE WHAT TYPE OF UNIFORM OPT OUT LOGO OR BUTTO SHOULD BE DEVELOPED TO INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT. NUMBER SIX THE NOTICES AND INFORMATION THAT BUSINESSES MUST PROVIDE INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE OFFERINGS. A NUMBER SEVEN HOW CONSUMER OR THEIR AGENT CAN SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION TO A BUSINESS AND HOW THE BUSINESS VERY REASONABLY VERIFIES THESE REQUESTS. WITH AN OPEN UP THE FORM SO THAT ANYONE CAN SPEAK. AGAIN BECAUSE BOTH THE CCPA AND THE A. P. A. SET FORTH THE DEPARTMENT'S ROLE IN THIS PRELIMINARY STAGE IS TO LISTEN AND SEEK BROAD PUBLIC PARTICIPATION WE DO NOT PROVIDE RESPONSES TO THOSE PUBLIC COMMENTS AND WE DO NOT ASK OR ANSWER ANY SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS DURING THE FORM. INDEED THIS IS WHY WE HAVE HELD NUMEROUS FORMS AS WELL AS ADDED THE ADDITIONAL FORM AT STANFORD. TO GIVE THE PUBLIC AS MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK DIRECTLY TO US ON WHAT THE CCPA REGULATIONS SHOULD ADDRESS. THE ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION HAS BURIED AT THE FORMS FOR EXAMPLE OUR FIRST FORM IN SAN FRANCISCO HAD NEARLY TWO HUNDRED ATTENDEES BUT ONLY FOURTEEN SPEAKERS. THE MORE RECENT FORMS IN LOS ANGELES AND SACRAMENTO HAVE HAD MUCH HIGHER SPEAKER PARTICIPATION FEATURING COMMENTS FROM THE AYE TECH INDUSTRY. PRIVACY ADVOCATES CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS AND WHILE THE FORM WAS GOING ON I WAS EXCHANGING SOME TEXT MESSAGES WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND I HEAR THAT THAT ONE WAS ALSO VERY WELL ATTENDED. AND IT LASTED FOR NEARLY THE ENTIRE TIME WITH ACTIVE PARTICIPATION AND FEEDBACK FROM THE PUBLIC. WE ENCOURAGE EVERY SPEAKER FORM ATTENDEE AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC INCLUDING YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO SUBMIT WRITTEN COMMENTS DIRECTLY TO US. THE PUBLIC HAS AND IS CONTINUING TO SUBMIT THESE COMMENTS TO US VIA EMAIL OR MAIL AND MAY DO SO UNTIL FRIDAY MARCH EIGHTH. FOR CONSIDERATION DURING THIS PRELIMINARY PROVER PRE RULE STAGE WE ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO NOT MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STAGE. AND SUBMIT THEIR COMMENTS BEFORE THE DEADLINE. IN ADDITION WE HAVE CREATED NUMEROUS WAYS FOR THE PUBLIC TO STINK AGE TO BY DEDICATING A PORTION OF OUR WEBSITE TO THE CCPA. MAINTAINING AN EMAIL SUBSCRIPTION LIST TO PUBLICIZE UPCOMING EVENTS POSTING OUR RULE MAKING MATERIALS AND ALL OF THAT INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE. WE'VE ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT WE HER ONLY AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR RULE MAKING PROCESS AND THAT THE PUBLIC WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE. WE ANTICIPATE ENSURING THE FORMAL RULE MAKING PERIOD IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE FORMAL RULE MAKING PROCESS WILL BEGIN WHEN WE PUBLISH OUR NOTICE OF PROPOSED REGULATORY ACTION WHICH WILL INCLUDE AN INITIAL STATEMENT OF REASONS AND A DRAFT TEXT OF THE REGULATIONS. THE FORMAL RULE MAKING PROCESS WILL INCLUDE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC HEARINGS RECEIPT AND CONSIDERATION OF PUBLIC COMMONS RESPONSES TO THESE COMMENTS AND ANY POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE TEXT OF THE REGULATIONS. WE ONCE AGAIN ENCOURAGE YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO PARTICIPATE DURING THIS FORMAL STAGE ABRIL MAKING. AND ALTHOUGH THE TIMELINE IS TIGHT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK DILIGENTLY TO MEET THE STATUTORY DEADLINE OF JUNE JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THIS LEADS TO THE SECOND COMPONENT OF MY TESTIMONY. AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL STATED IN HIS AUGUST TWENTY SECOND TWENTY EIGHTEEN LETTER PROVIDING CALIFORNIANS WITH PRIVACY PROTECTION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOW MORE THAN EVER. HOWEVER THE CCP P. A. AS IT CURRENTLY APPLIES TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE PRESENTS ON WORKABLE OBLIGATIONS AND SIRIUS OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES. AS AG BUT THERE FOR FURTHER STRESSED FAILURE TO CURE THE IDENTIFIED FLAWS WILL UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA'S AUTHORITY TO LAUNCH INSISTING VIGOROUS OVERSIGHT AND EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT. OF THE CCP'S CRITICAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE CONCERNS LAST YEAR. BY A SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY ONE HOWEVER THREE STILL REMAIN THIS IS WHY WE PARTNERED WITH YOU SENATOR JACKSON TO SPONSOR SENATE SENATE BILL. FIVE SIXTY ONE NEEDED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ADDRESS THESE FLAWS THAT I'M ABOUT TO DISCUSS AND BOTH STRENGTHENING CLARIFY THE CCPA SO THANK YOU AGAIN. FIRST THE CCPA ALLOWS ANY BUSINESS AND THIRD PARTY TO SEEK GUIDANCE DIRECTLY FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. ASKING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE LEGAL COUNSEL AT TAXPAYERS EXPENSE DIRECTLY CONFLICTS WITH OUR CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION TO INVESTIGATE AND ENFORCE THE LAW. AGAINST ENTITIES THAT VIOLATE THOSE LAWS. OUR OBLIGATION IS TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOT THE BUSINESSES THAT VIOLATE THESE LOS. ANY USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS TO PROVIDE UNLIMITED LEGAL ADVICE TO PRIVATE PARTIES WOULD BE UNFAIR AND UNCONSCIONABLE NOT TO MENTION A WASTE OF VALUABLE STATE RESOURCES. ACCORDINGLY SB FIVE SIXTY ONE THE LEADS THE PROVISION ALLOWING GOT BUSINESSES TO SEEK LEGAL OPINION FROM THE AG. AND INSTEAD AUTHORIZES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO PUBLISH MATERIALS THAT MAY PROVIDE BUSINESSES AND OTHERS WITH GENERAL GUIDANCE ON HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE C. CPA. ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS ON PAST OCCASIONS VOLUNTARILY DEVELOPED AND PUBLISHED GENERAL GUIDANCE ON VARIOUS LAWS INCLUDING AB FOR FIFTY FROM. TWENTY SEVENTEEN A BILL ON IMMIGRATION WORK SITE ENFORCE. THIS BILL SB FIVE SIXTY ONE WOULD CODIFY OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SOME GENERAL INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS. MOREOVER THE REGULATIONS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL INTENDS TO ISSUE WILL ALSO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE CCPA. SECOND THE CCPA PROVIDE THE BUSINESS WITH THE RIGHT TO CURE ANY ALLEGED VIOLATION BEFORE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY OUR OFFICE FOR BREAKING THE LAW. THIS WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD. BUSINESSES WOULD BE PERMITTED TO VIOLATE THE LAW EVEN KNOWINGLY AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD HAVE NO ABILITY TO INITIATE AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION WITHOUT GIVING THE BUSINESS NOTICE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO CURE THE VIOLATION. THIS WOULD NOT ONLY FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER HOW OUR OFFICE INVESTIGATES AND PROSECUTES CORPORATE MISCONDUCT BUT WOULD DRAMATICALLY HINDER OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. EVERY DAY WE ARE SEEING COMPANIES BEING CARELESS WITH CALIFORNIANS PERSONAL INFORMATION. ANDDATA AND WE HAVE SEEN COMPANIES WHO KNOWINGLY AVOID COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. THE CZ P. IS RIGHT TO CARE WOULD ALLOW EVEN THE WORST OFFENDERS TO RECEIVE A PASS RATHER THAN ALLOWING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO TO USE HIS PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION ENFORCING THE LAW. GIVING BUSINESSES THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A FIX THAT TICKET DISADVANTAGES BOTH CONSUMERS AND HONEST BUSINESSES THAT ARE PLAYING BY THE RULES FOR THESE REASONS SB FIVE SIXTY ONE WOULD REPEAL THE RIGHT TO CARE PROVISION WITH RESPECT TO AGE ENFORCEMENT UNDER THE ACT. THIRD THE CCP EIGHT LACKS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIANS THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE RIGHTS CONFERRED BY THIS GROUND BREAKING LAW. INSTEAD THE ACT INCLUDES ONLY A LIMITED RIGHT TO SUE IF A CONSUMER BECOMES A VICTIM OF A DATA BREACH. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION PROVIDE A CRITICAL ON JUNK TO GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT AND THE ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS CAN ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS AND SEEK APPROPRIATE REMEDIES. THEREFORE THE AG URGES YOU TO ENACT SB FIVE SIXTY ONE WHICH SEEKS TO EXPAND THE CCPA RIGHT OF ACTION TO INCLUDE VIOLATIONS OF KHI RIGHTS PROVIDED BY THE ACT. FINALLY WE WANT TO ONCE AGAIN THANK THE CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO AND SENATOR HERTZBERG THE SPEAKER THE PROTON AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR PROVIDING DOJ WITH THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN FUNDING. WE ALSO WANT TO THANK GOVERNOR NEW SOME FOR THANK FOR INCLUDING IN HIS TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET PROPOSAL THE AMOUNT DOJ REQUESTED FOR THE ONGOING COSTS OF CCPA IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT. WE ONCE AGAIN APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S SUPPORT FOR THE AMOUNT OF PROVIDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AT THIS POINT I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT MY TESTIMONY TODAY. WELL I AM HAPPY TO DISCUSS OUR RULE MAKING ACTIVITIES THUS FAR OR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S POLICY CONCERNS BECAUSE WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDST OF DRAFTING THE REGULATIONS I CANNOT OPINE ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE C. CPA OR DIMENSIONAL ENFORCEMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE APPRECIATE THAT THERE BEEN SEVEN OF THESE RATHER ROBUST HEARINGS AND THAT A NUMBER OF THE ISSUES WHICH WERE PRESENTED TODAY OF AS HE SHOES OF CONCERN. ARE WITHIN THE AG'S DIRECTIVE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND AND REGULATIONS SO APPRECIATE THAT EFFORT AND ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM. CENTER WHAT COST COULD YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. NO. I THINK -- OBVIOUSLY LOOKING FOR TO WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON THESE IMPORTANT ASPECTS. OF ENFORCEMENT AND JUST WONDER -- I DO THINK YOU DID MENTION THE AG -- HAS -- A PROVIDED TO A PRIVATE ENTITIES LEGAL COUNSEL -- OR NO I TAKE THAT BACK A HAVE GIVEN GENERAL OUR GUIDANCE BUT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO INSTANCES WHERE. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS HAD TO PROVIDE PRIVATE ENTITIES WITH LEGAL COUNSEL IN THIS REALLY -- WOULD BE A FAIR RATHER EXTRAORDINARY EXCEPTION TO THAT RULE -- IN I THINK IN THAT CASE AS YOU MENTION WITH THE PUBLIC ENDING UP PAYING FOR IT ARE YOU WONDER WHY IN THE WORLD. WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING LEGAL COUNSEL TO COMPANIES THAT CLEARLY HAVE BEEN. MAKING EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND PROBABLY HAVE A STABLE OF THEIR OWN ATTORNEYS ON HANDING COULD CERTAINLY GO OUT AND HIRE PRIVATE COUNSEL WITHOUT TAKING FURTHER ADVANTAGE OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND USING PUBLIC FUNDS -- TO GET INFORMATION THAT THEY PROBABLY KNOW CERTAINLY SHOULD KNOW AND HAVE THEIR OWN RESOURCES TO FIND OUT SO. AGAIN -- APPRECIATE THE YOUR EFFORTS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S EFFORTS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THAT ASPECT OF THE SODA THIS VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. WITH THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH OF I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GET HOME TO DAUGHTER. AND TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- YOU'RE ABLE TO DO THAT -- FULLY THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CAR HAVING ME HERE AND INVITING ME AGAIN TO TESTIFIED TODAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORK. OUT WITH THAT -- WE HAVE -- TWO MORE PANELS -- WE'RE GOING TO ASK THAT WE TRY TO MOVE IT ALONG -- WE HAVE DOMINIQUE SHELTON LABS LEIPZIG OF PRIVATE IS A PARTNER IN PRIVACY AND SECURITY AND CULTURE OF THE ED TECH PRIVACY AND DATA MANAGEMENT FOR PERKINS I THINK IT'S KHïI. COOLEY LLP AN ARCH KERN SOLTANI FORMER CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST FOR THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION THEY'RE GONNA TALK ON UNDERSTANDING HOW CONSUMER INFORMATION. IS BEING COLLECTED USED AND VALUED AND I THINK FRANKLY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION BECAUSE I THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW. SO WITH THAT A MISS LEIPZIG. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FIRST OF ALL FOR AT ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY I AND ALSO THE MEMBERS. I'M JUST MAKE IT CLEAR I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND NOT ANY PARTICULAR CLIENT OR THE FIRM. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A STEP BACK IN MY A TESTIMONY AND SORT OF LIVING OUTSIDE OF THE CPA AND BUSINESS TO KIND OF GO TO I THINK A HIGHER LEVEL CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. WHICH IS -- AND I'VE HEARD OTHERS MENTION SOME OF THE WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENT RIGHT. THAT AND THAT WE AS A SOCIETY WON T. INDIO ON ALL OF US AND YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT IN TIME. I FEEL LIKE WE ARE REALLY IN A POSTED A WORLD. AND WHEN I USE THE WORD POST DATA I MEAN THAT JUST EVEN SITTING HERE IN THIS ROOM TODAY -- WE'VE HEARD YOU KNOW TOPICS ABOUT INTERNET CONNECTED DEVICES AND MADAM CHAIR YOU RECEIVED A TEXT FROM YOUR HUSBAND AND WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT. THE FUNDAMENTALS OF BILLY OPERATING IN SOCIETY TODAY ARE SO DEPENDENT ON TECHNOLOGY AND FOR JUST DAY TO DAY FUNCTIONALITY. AND BEYOND OF DAY TO DAY FUNCTIONALITY I'M THINKING ABOUT. THE WAYS IN WHICH I INNOVATION IS HAPPENING IN WAYS THAT BUT THAT AS A SOCIETY I THINK WE WANT TO KEEP IN MIND. AS WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AT THAT'S BEEN KICKED OFF BY THE SEA CPA. I'VE BEEN PRACTICING SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND MY VERY FIRST A INTRODUCTION TO PRIVACY WAS IN LAW SCHOOL IN NINETEEN NINETY WHERE I TOOK A CLASS WITH PROFESSOR ANITA ALLEN ON PRIVACY AND AMERICAN LAW. AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE FOCUSED ON THE PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF THE PRIVATE LIVES OF POLITICIANS AND I WROTE MY PAPER ON REPRESENTATIVES OF FRANK. BUT LEAVING WE'VE EVOLVED SO MUCH -- SINCE THAT TIME AND I THINK AND THE AND YEARS I'VE DEDICATED TO PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY. THE LEVEL OF INTEREST AND EXCITEMENT -- THAT I SEE AROUND HOW NEW TECHNOLOGIES I CAN BE USED AND LEVERAGE AND SOCIETY. SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME THINGS THAT THAT I PERSONALLY EXPERIENCEIN THE PAST YEAR TO GIVE YOU SOME SENSE. OF A WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MODERATE A PANEL FOR THE DIABETES TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION IN VIRGINIA. AND THERE I HEARD SOME VERY EXCITING TEST YOU KNOW STORIES FROM. MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ABOUT THE WAY THAT THEY'RE USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO BE ABLE TO COORDINATE MULTIPLE PATTERNS AND BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY YOU JUST BY USING RETINAL SCANS. AND OTHER INFORMATION WHETHER A CHILD AT THE AGE OF TWELVE CAN BE HAVE THE PREDICTIVE JEAN TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE THEY WILL HAVE A CUT UP VERY RARE FORM OF DIABETES THAT WOULD RENDER THAT CHILD. BLIND AND BE ABLE TO TAKE PREVENTATIVE STEPS AHEAD OF TIME TO AVOID THAT. THAT'S TRANSFORMATIVE YOU KNOW -- I'M THINKING ABOUT CLINTON DEAL HIGH SCHOOL THAT I READ ABOUT WHEN I WAS ON VACATION IN COSTA RICA IN DECEMBER. AND IT WHERE A PRINCIPAL GREG ALLEN. TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK AT THE SITUATION WHERE HIS THE KIDS IN THE SCHOOL WERE. AS THINKING AND FAILING AND NOT PASSING COURSES BECAUSE OF THE DISRUPTION WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE AUTO INDUSTRY RIGHT SO. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN THERE WAS THAT DOWNTURN THERE WASA MAJOR ECONOMIC IMPACT IN DETROIT AND THEY THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITY THAT. WAS ON ITS WAY TO LOSE THEIR HIGH SCHOOL SCHOOL WAS ABLETO TRANSFORM THAT SITUATION. THROUGH TECHNOLOGY WHERE -- AND I READ ABOUT THIS IN OF A BOOK CALLED GREAT AT WORK THAT WAS WRITTEN BY MORE ENHANCE IN HERE IN THE BAY AREA. BUT HE USE THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW INNOVATION AND THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX FOR THIS PRINCIPLE TOOK THE TIME. TO AND THROUGH TECHNOLOGY TO RESEARCH HOW THE STUDENTS CAN COULD ACTUALLY TAKE LESSONS AND WATCH VIDEO REMOTELY TO LEARN AND THEN COME INTO THE CLASSROOM WHERE YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THEIR PARENTS WERE DISTRACTED WITH THE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND JUST NOT IN A POSITION. TO MENTOR THOSE KIDS WITH THEIR HOMEWORK AND THAT IS NOT THAT IS WHY THEY WERE NOT EXCELLING AND SO TO USE THE CLASSROOM TIME INFLICT THAT CAL CLASSROOM. SO THAT THE KIDS CAN ACTUALLY LEARN AND TO THE POINT NOW WHERE THEY HAVE A 94% GRADUATION RATE I MEAN. THAT'S TRANSFORMATIVE THAT'S WHAT TECHNOLOGY WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE. I'M LOOKING AT YOU KNOW THE CITIES THAT ARE AROUND THE COUNTRY AND GLOW OF THEIR INVOLVED IN SMART CITY DISCUSSIONS. AND HOUSTON IN TWENTY TWO OTHER CITIES THAT ARE LOOKING AT THINGS THAT INVOLVE NOT JUST ON USING TECHNOLOGY. FOR TRACKING AND FOR SAFETY PURPOSES BUT ALSO TO USE TECHNOLOGY. TO BRING THINGS LIKE WIFI INTO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE THERE ARE A VAST NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY WHO CANNOT. WHO CANNOT ALONE AND DRIVE A CAR AND THAT WE? AND I'M THINKING OF WHERE'S THAT HAS TAKEN A MAJOR HIT AS YOU KNOW IN ON TERMS OF PEOPLE. MAKING SALES AND ACTUALLY SHOWING UP IN PHYSICAL STORES. AND HOW THEY'RE USING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO IF YOU CAN GO INTO A PHYSICAL STORE OR DOWNLOAD AN APP AND SEE HOW THAT MAKE UP WITH LOOK ON YOUR FACE SIR. AT CLOSE THAT MIGHT SUGGEST THAT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN A WAY TO TO KEEP BUSINESS. IN CALIFORNIA AND IN OTHER LOCATIONS. I'M THINKING ABOUT ALSO WITH THE MARGINS BEING WHAT THEY ARE HOW IMPORTANT MACHINE LEARNING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THOSE THINGS ARE FUELED BY LOTS OF DATA TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MODELS AND PREDICTIVE MODELS WORK. THAT PREDICTIVE ALGORITHMS THAT CAN BE USED TO YOU. SEE WHEN YEARS WHEN YOU ARE OVER ORDERING AND THE STOCK SUPPLY DOESN'T NEED TO BE ORDERED TO THAT LEVEL. AND THEREBY BUT EVEN WITHOUT INCREASE SALES BEING ABLE TO KEEP BUSINESS LIKE RETAILERS IN THE IN. THE RUNNING AND IT HAPPENED IN CREATING JOBS BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO YOU REDUCE THEIR MARGINS AND WE HAD AN AND A VERY INTERESTING. DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT IN OUR OFFICE WHEN -- A VENDOR PANORAMIC CAME IN AND EXPLAINED WHAT THEY WERE DOING. I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW. THE MICO BUSINESSES THAT EXIST NOT JUST YOU KNOW A BRIDE IN ASIA AFRICA MIDDLE EAST BUT ALSO RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN VISIBILITY AND GOODS AND WEARS WOULD NOT BE VISIBLE A LOT OF THEM WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES WOULD NOT BE SEEN BUT FOR THE INTERNET BUT FOR MOBILE PAYMENTS BUT FOR APPS. AND NOT TO MENTION THE GIG ECONOMY WHERE SO MANY ARTISTS AND OTHERS ARE ABLE TO YOU OF MOONLIGHT DOING OTHER JOBS AND KEEP THEMSELVES AFLOAT. AT THIS IS NOT JUST A CALIFORNIA ISSUE -- I AND IT'S NOT JUST AN E. YOU ISSUE I SPENT THE BETTER PART IS A SAID AS YOU KNOW THE PAST. AT TWENTY SEVEN YEARS TO THINKING ABOUT REALIZED AND THIS IS TIMELY BECAUSE THAT UGANDA JUST PAST THEIR DATA PROTECTION LAW BECOMING. THE OVER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY COUNTRIES NOW THAT HAVE DATA PROTECTION POLICIES. EVERY DAY I REPRESENT BUSINESS THAT IS TRYING TO GET THIS RIGHT BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. THAT WE ALL LOOK AT THE PATH FORWARD UP THROUGH CONSIDERING DATA. FOR EVERYONE AS A PRE TANGIBLE ASSET AND WHEN I SAY PRE TANGIBLE AN ASSET I MEAN THAT. THE POWER OF DATA THE ABILITY OF DATA AND THE VALUE OF DATA HAS NOT REALLY BEEN FOUGHT THROUGH ENTIRELY. IMITATE WHAT I MEAN BY THAT. CONSUMERS NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE VALUE OF DATA MEANS TO THEM. IT'S VERY DIFFERENT DISCUSSION BETWEEN US IN THIS ROOM OR EVEN IN ALL UE RESPECT MR Và TAGGART. AND SAY THE CHEN Z. A GROUP AND SOCIETY THAT ARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR THIS IS THE FIRST IS THE FIRST GENERATION BORNINTO THE DIGITAL AGE. THEY WERE BORN WITH AS YOU KNOW DIGITIZATION IN WAYS THAT NONE OF US WERE. THEIR CONCEPT OF PRIVACY AND WITH THE CONSIDER TO BE PROTECTED IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN SAY YOU KNOW MANY OF US MIGHT FEEL IN THIS ROOM. THE VALUE PROPOSITION TO THOSE CONSUMERS OF WHAT THEY DECIDE TO PLACE ON TO THE INTERNET SHARE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE OBVIOUSLY UNDERSTAND THE REPERCUSSIONS OF WEATHER PERMITTING. BUT UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE PROPOSITIONS CAN SHIFT. I'MREMINDED OF A SHIREY CAFE I WENT TO BROWN UNIVERSITY AND I READ ABOUT THIS IN THE STATE IS ALL INFORMATION I'VE LEARNED IN THE PAST YEAR GUYS -- YOU KNOW IT I READ ABOUT SHARPER CAFE. IN ASIAN BASED CORPORATION. MOVES INTO A CAFE A SITUATION A BROWN SAID ALMOST 75% OF THE STUDENTS HAVE SIGNED UP. WHEN THEY GO IN TO GET A COFFEE YEARS AGO AND THEY DO NOT PAY CASH THEY AGREED TO PAY WITH THEIR DATA ON WHY BECAUSE THEY THE CAFE IS SPONSORED BY? CORPORATIONS THAT ARE USING THE DATA TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE. SELECT CERTAIN STUDENTS FOR HAD MADE THE DECISION THEY WOULD-RATHER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A FREE COFFEE SIT WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEIR DREAM JOB. AND WHO ARE WE AS A SOCIETY TO NOT ALLOW THOSE SORTS OF FRANK TRANSACTIONS. IF WE WANT -- TO TO ALLOW SORT OF YOU KNOW INDEPENDENCE SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS THE CONVERSATION I'VE BEEN LISTENING VERY CAREFULLY. HAS OUR I THINK. WHAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT EVERYBODY'S ROLE IN THE CONVERSATION SO THAT MEANS THAT IT'S NOT JUST A BUSINESS DISCUSSION IT'S NOT JUST A A COMPLIANCE DISCUSSION THIS IS A? WE CAN USE THE CATALYST OF THE CALIFORNIA LAW AND YOU'RE RIGHT THE GLOBE IS LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA I AM GETTING CALLS FROM JAPAN THE E. U.. AFRICA WANTING TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL DOING BUSINESS IN OUR ECONOMY. AND SO WE NEED TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS AND HOPING PEOPLE TO BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT THE VALUE PROPOSITION. I THINK IT BE A MISTAKE TO ASSUME THAT CONSUMERS HAVE MADE THIS VALUE PROPOSITION THAT DISCUSSION AND IS ALSO A MISTAKE TO ASSUME THAT EVERY BUSINESS IS DONE AT TO THE CONTRARY -- IT WAS JUST READ AN ARTICLE AT THAT ONE OF MY ASSOCIATES GAPING A TASHA ON FEBRUARY AT NIGHT THE HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW DID PUBLISHED A REPORT. THAT WAS DONE A STUDY THAT WAS DONE BY THE FORTUNE ONE THOUSAND COMPANIES AND 53% OF THEM SAID THAT THEY WEREN'T IN A POSITION TO VALUE DATA NOT WITHSTANDING. SPENDING YOU KNOW. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES BIG DATA TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A DIGITAL. A DIGITIZED ASIAN MODEL BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT IF WITHOUT A DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MODEL THEY'RE GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND% LIKE SO MANY OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT ARE. GO BYE BYE SO IN ORDER TO STILL KEEP JOBS AND AND INNOVATION DIGITIZE ASIAN IS NECESSARY. BUT HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND HOW TO IN THAT HAS NOT BEEN DISCUSSED. SO WHAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE IS THAT WE USE THIS AND AGAIN I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO SPECIFICS AT A ABOUT ANY PARTICULAR FIXER OR ANY PARTICULAR ISSUE WHEN A LOT OF WHAT I WANNA SAY IS THERE ARE FRINGE CASES. AND THOSE WILL BE ADDRESSED AND AND ALSO THAT SO MUCH HAS BEEN DONE IN THE VACUUM OF LEGISLATION AND OUT DATA PROTECTION LAWS WHICH HAVE NOW SORT OF BEEN SHEPHERDED AND AT BECAUSE OF THE VISIBILITY I THINK THAT STARTED WITH GPR BUT WE'VE. SEEN A FLOOD OF NEW. ALLIES THAT ARE COMING IN ACROSS THE GLOBE. IT'S NOT AS IF BUSINESSES WERE EMAIL FLAGRANTLY VIOLATING SOMETHING THAT EXISTED WE'RE CREATING AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO CREATE THE RULES NOW TO MAKE THIS PUNITIVE YOU KNOW I'M LOOKING SOMEBODY TALKED ABOUT WHAT IS IT NEED NOT TO DEFINE REASONABLE SECURITY. IN OF THE REASONABLE SECURITY IS IN OUR STATUTES CIVIL CODE SECTION SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT EIGHTY ONE POINT FIVE UNDEFINED. EVERY CALIFORNIA ANY COMPANY THAT MAINTAINS CALIFORNIA DATA NEEDS TO HAVE REASONABLE SECURITY WE'VE NEVER SAID WHAT THAT MEANS. SO WHEN I'M YOU KNOW JUST GOING BACK TO THE CHAMBERS POINT. OF FIGURING OUT LET. WHAT ARE HAVE COMPANIES INVESTED MILLIONS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN IS TO MAP TO DATA SECURITY STANDARDS LIKE NEST LIKE I SAID? LAKE AND YOU KNOW ALL OF THE ABOVE. MANY OTHER WRITTEN INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAMS AND AS TO THE STATE OF THE ART WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN BECAUSE WE ARE IN A HIGHLY LITIGIOUS ENVIRONMENT. IS THAT YOU KNOW BUSINESSES ARE SUED OUT OF BUSINESS SOMEBODY ASKED WITH THE HOWTO QUANTIFY THIS AND WE HAVE TAKEN A LOOK AT THE PUBLIC RECORD TO DATA BREACHES IN 200-012-22000. SIXTEEN ON THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S WEBSITE IF THIS LAW HAD BEEN IN PLACE THE EXPOSURE COULD BE ANYWHERE BETWEEN THIRTY SEVEN BILLION TO THIRTY THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE BILLION. ON AVERAGE ABOUT NINE BILLION OF EXPOSURE PER PER YEAR PER COMPANY IF A IF THE TRANSIT KEPT UP FROM TWO THOUSAND TELL TWELVE TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN OF DATA BREACHES AT OUR PUBLICLY REPORTED. WE NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE AS WE GO INTO THIS HIGHLY LITIGIOUS STATE. BECAUSE UNLIKE EUROPE THE DOES NOT HAVE A TRADITION OF CLASS ACTIONS WE DO AND SO I'VE HEARD IN A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RESERVE THAT THE AG'S OFFICE WILL -- WILL MAKE AND DISCRETION TO NOT PUT CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES OUT OF BUSINESS. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE SITTING IN THE REALITY OF OUR HIGHLY LITIGIOUS STATE AND UNDERSTAND THAT NOT EVERY LITIGATOR NOT EVERY. CONSUMER ADVOCATE IS GOING TO HAVE THE FULL BREADTH OF EXPERIENCEAND AND ALSO CONTEXT TO NOT YOU KNOW SOUP COMPANIES YOU KNOW OUT OF SMITHEREENS AND TAKE. AND TAKE BUSINESS OUT OF CALIFORNIA SO I JUST WANTED TO ON FRAME IT THAT WAY AND WITH THAT I WOULD JUST DEFERRED Q. AS KIND. BUT BEFORE WE GET THERE I JUST WANT TO SAY A COUPLE COMMENTS APPRECIATE APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING -- BUT THE LACK OF REGULATION IS IT CREATES A WILD WEST AND ONE OF OUR JOBS AS POLICY MAKERS IS TO TAKE THE VALUES IN THE EXPECTATIONS. OF THE PEOPLE WHAT ARE THE NEEDS OF HUMAN BEINGS TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF PRIVACY. AND TO CREATE THAT OLD BUSINESSES AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH TECHNOLOGY -- WILL BE CHANGING OUR WORLD IT WILL BE A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD IN TEN YEARS AND IT IS NOW AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE EVEN. HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN BASIC HUMAN VALUES -- HUMAN NEEDS THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH TECHNOLOGY AND SO THAT IS ONE OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES HERE AND THE OTHER I THINK IS I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE'S. EXPECTATIONS OF PRIVACY VERY DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF US OLD FOLKS BUT WHAT THEY ARE WHAT WHAT WHAT I THINK WE ALL AGREE OR WEEK. HOPEFULLY DO AGREE IS THAT BEFORE WE RELINQUISH. OUR RIGHTS TO PRIVACY WE KNOW WHERE THAT INFORMATION'S GOING TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO EXCHANGE A CUP OF COFFEE -- FOR YOUR INFORMATION SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THEIR JOB OF THEIR DREAMS. ALSO NEED TO KNOW OR SHOULD KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT INFORMATION IS BEING SOLD TO WHO KNOWS WHAT FOR WHO KNOW WHAT. YOU KNOW FOR WHAT PURPOSE THAT THEY MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE. BE WEAR OFF AND IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF GIVING PEOPLE THE RESPECT. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE CHOICES BY BEING GIVE A SERIES INTERESTING DYNAMICS THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS BUT AS POLICYMAKERS HERE I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE IDENTIFY. THE VALUES OF THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA NOW THE MIX NEXT GENERATION MAY SAY LET'S THROW OUT THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY BUT THE IRONY IS THAT THIS. RIGHT TO PRIVACY THAT'S WRITTEN RIGHT INTO OUR CONSTITUTION CAME FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS SO PRESCIENT FORTY YEARS AGO. WHO ANTICIPATED THE POTENTIALS FOR ALL OF THESE FASCINATING AND MANY VERY VERY HELPFUL AND POSITIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR SOME OF THE NEGATIVE SIDE TO THAT SO THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE INPUT? AND PRIORITIZE THE VALUES OF THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE CONSIDERED TO BE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE SO THANK YOU FOR THOSE THOSE COMMENTS AND MISTER US SOLTANI IF YOU'D LIKE -- TO SHARE WITH US IF YOU COULD I'M HOPING WE GET OUT HERE BY FIVE SO. LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON ALL OF THE SYSTEM. HOW TO MASTER AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOUR YOUR LAST STATEMENT MORE -- MY NAME'S ASK COUNSEL TINY HERMAN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGIST -- ONE OF THE FIRST TECHNOLOGIES THE FTC I WORKED ON THE TWITTER FACEBOOK GOOGLE CASES DIRECTLY I WAS ALSO THE LATER THE CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST AT THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION OF WORKED IN THIS INDUSTRY FOR ABOUT. TWO DECADES AS A SECURITY RESEARCHER AND PRIVACY RESEARCHER ALSO A FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED GLOBAL AND THOUSAND COMPANIES -- INSURE TODAY LIKE TO DISCUSS KIND OF THREE MAIN POINTS ONE IS THAT THE STATE OF I'M ON PRIVACY TODAY INCLUDING THE DISCUSSION OF TION OF CPA. AND INCLUDING HOW THE CCK ADDRESSES SOME OF THE CRITICAL PARTS OF THIS ECOSYSTEM. AND THREE BRIEFLY TOUCH ON WHY OTHER APPROACHES ARE LIKELY TO FALL SHORT GIVEN THE COMPLEXITIES OF THIS ECOSYSTEM BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE BOTH SIDE IN DC AND AND ELSEWHERE -- ARMOR AND THE LAST PERSON I'M GONNA TRY TO KIND OF JAM THROUGH BUT FEEL FREE TO JUST LIKE IF I GET TOO FAR INTO THE WEEDS JUST CUT ME OFF. ONE PANEL AFTER YOU SONORA PART OF US GIVE US YOUR INFORMATION I DON'T RUSSIAN THROUGH -- SO AS WE ALL KNOW BY NOW DID IS COLLECTED IN AGATE ABOUT US OF NEARLY ALL OF OUR ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISCERN -- HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND BY WHOM SO WHEN I VISITED BITS OF BUSINESS OR WEBSITE HI INTENSELY DISCLOSE SOME INFORMATION TO THAT SITE OR SERVICE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THAT CENTER SERVICES COULD BE WALKING INTO A STORE AND GIVING THEM MY -- CREDIT CARD AND ADDRESS INFORMATION OR GOING TO A WEBSITE AND REQUESTING THAT THEY SERVE ME THE PAGE ABOUT THE STORY THAT I'M INTERESTED IN -- THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE I THINK IT I WANNA DISCUSSES THAT -- DODD WEBSITE CURRENTLY CAN THEN SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH A NUMBER OF THIRD PARTIES EITHER TO PROVIDE ME ADDITIONAL SERVICE OR FOR THIS FAIL A PERSON COMMISSION TO DATA BROKERS WAR FOR THE SALE OF THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING. AND CURLY THERE'S NO LAW A RESTRICTION AROUND THE SALE AND SHARING AND THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT I THINK IS A CRITICAL SHORTCOMING TODAY -- MOST CRITICALLY AT THE THE DATA IS INSURED FOR DATED A PURPOSE OFTEN YOU CAN PROVIDE THE SERVICE IN A FIRST PARTY BASIS AND NOT SHARED WITH THIRD PARTIES -- THERE ADDITIONALLY. THIRD PARTY SHINING HAPPENS WITHOUT CONSUMERS KNOWING AND MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT IF THERE'S A PRIVACY POLICY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE THAT THEIR INFORMATION IS PROTECTED THERE'S SOME GREAT STUDIES FROM Q. AND ANNENBERG AND BERKELEY INCLUDE THAT. TO LOOK AT WHAT CONSUMERS BELIEVE WHEN THEY SEE JUST THE LINK PRIVACY POLICY -- MY ENTRY TO THE SPACE STARTED NOR AN IMAC GRADUATE SCHOOL IN AROUND. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IN WHICH MIGHT CAPS ON PRODUCT PROJECT CALLED NO PRIVACY LOOKED AT HOW COMPANIES WERE COLLECTING AND SURVEY THAT WE DID OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND WEBSITES BY CRAWLING WEBSITES AND LOOKING HOW THEY WERE SHARING DATA WE FOUND FOR EXAMPLE THAT. ON 88% OF THE WEBSITES WE SURVEYED -- THAT GOOGLE OR SOME SORT OF GOOGLE ELEMENT WAS COLLECTING DATA ABOUT CONSUMERS ON THE 88% OF THOSE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND UPSETS. ON THE TOP ONE HUNDRED WEBSITES. EIGHTY EIGHTY OF THOSE SHARE DATA WITH GOOGLE AND AT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FACEBOOK WASN'T AS POPULAR BUT THOSE NUMBERS ARE WORSE TODAY. IN TWENTY ELEVEN I HELPED THE WALL STREET JOURNAL A STUDY THE INFORMATION MOBILE APPS WOULD COLLECT FROM CONSUMERS AND IN A STUDY OF A HUNDRED ONE POPULAR SMARTPHONE APPS. WE FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF TRANSMITTED THE PHONES UNIQUE DEVICE IDENTIFIER THE HARDWARE IDENTIFIER TO THIRD PART PARTIES. AND NEARLY HALF A CENT FORTY SEVEN SET USES LOCATION TO EITHER THE DEVELOPER OR THIRD PARTIES AND THIS WAS NOT NECESSARY LOCATION BASED APPS THIS COULD BE A FLASHLIGHT APP THAT YOU OPEN. THAT SAYS YOUR PRECISE GPS LOCATION OF THIRD PARTIES -- IN THAT SAME SERIES THE BLAST PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST ON I THINK I HAVE ARGUED CONCERN ARTICLES WE WORKED ON WAS LOOKING AT HOW SOME COMPANIES WERE CHARGING CONSUMERS DIFFERENT PRICES. FOR GOODS BASED ON FOR EXAMPLE WHAT WEBSITES THEY'D VISITED -- WHERE THEIR LOCATION WE FOUND ONE RETAILER THAT FOR EXAMPLE WAS CHARGING CONSUMERS MORE FOR STAPLER -- OR FOR ANY OFFICE GETS ABOUT STAPLER -- BASED ON HOW FAR THEY WERE FROM THE COMPETITOR SO THEY KNEW HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS AN ABOUT CONSUMERS' WILLINGNESS TO PAY AND SO THEY WOULD CHARGE MORE FOR CONSUMERS. ONLINE -- TRANSPORTED TODAY AND SO SOME OF THE STORIES WE TALKED. I'M JUST GONNA QUICKLY JUMPED A COUPLE OF THESE JUST OF THIS MORNING ON THE WAY HERE I DID A QUICK. EXAMINATION OF THE SOCK BE WEBSITE. AND FOUND THAT. READING A STORY ABOUT SB FIVE SIXTY ONE THAT HAS A CASH -- YOU ALSO SET REFERENCE STAND -- MY DATA ABOUT MY VISIT WAS SENT TO SOME THIRD SOME NINETY ONE THIRD PARTIES A THIRD OF WHOM WERE ADVERTISERS ARE ANALYSTS COMPANIES A QUICK VIEW TO THE SANTA BARBARA INDEPENDENT ALSO FOUND THAT -- PROXY TWENTY ADVERTISERS ANALYTICS COMPANIES RECEIVE MY INFORMATION FROM JUST A VISIT -- AND IT'S NOT JUST THE ONLINE DRUG. JUST TO THAT ARTICLE SO AND IN AND OUT OF TALK ABOUT THAT THEY CAN TRACK ME ACROSS ARTICLES IN ACROSS SITES BUT I'LL TRY TO GO QUICKLY -- AND IT'S NOT JUST ONLINE TRACKING RIGHT TO THE PRACTICE OF SOME OF THEM KIND OF INNOVATIONS AND I'M TRACKING ALSO EXTEND TO THE PHYSICAL WORLD. IN A PRACTICE KNOWN AS MOBILE RETAIL TRACKING COMPANIES MONITOR THE EMANATIONS FROM OUR SMARTPHONES OR DEVICES AFTER WALK BY STORES IN STORES OR EVEN DOWN AISLES TO KNOW WHAT ITEMS WE LOOK AT HOW LONG WE DO WELL. SOME COLLECTOR INFERRED EMIGRATE GRAPHIC INFORMATION WHETHER WE COME FROM AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOODS AND THEN COME TO YOUR STORE TO REPORT TO THE STONER THE STORE OWNER. WHAT PORTION OF THOSE USERS ARE AFFLUENT EITHER WE MADE A PURCHASE AND THEN LINK THAT PURCHASE TO THE ACTUAL SALES OF OF -- THAT OCCURRED AT THE POINT OF SALE MACHINE -- THIS YEAR WE ALSO FOUND THE MOBILE PROVIDERS WERE SELLING CUSTOMERS REAL TIME LOCATION INFORMATION TO LOCATION AGGREGATORS WHO THEN FURTHER SELL INFORMATION PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS AND BOUNTY HUNTERS. THE REPORTERS THAT DID THE STORY -- WERE ABLE TO PURCHASE THEIR OWN RACE FORMATION AND TRACTOR WILL TIME OCCASION FOR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS -- WE ALSO FOUND ABOUT ABOUT A VPN PROVIDER CALLED A KNOB OF WHO WAS LATER ACQUIRED BY FACEBOOK THAT WAS -- MONITORING THE PRIVATE INTERNET TRAFFIC OF ITS USERS SOME AS YOUNG AS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD -- THIS THIS AND THIS ALSO LOOK THIS IMPORTANT MATTER TO LOOK AT ENCRYPTED TRAFFIC SO DECRYPT ENCRYPTED TRAFFIC TO EVEN LOOK AT KIND OF WHAT CONSUMERS WOULD CONSIDER PRIVATE IN THAT CONTEXT. SO ISN'T A DEEPLY INVASIVE -- TWEET ALERT LEARNED ABOUT THE SENSITIVE ABSENT AND MANY HAVE SAID -- REFERENCE TODAY ABOUT A MOBILE APPS REPORTING WOMEN'S MENSTRUATION CYCLES BUT I HEALTH INFORMATION HEART RATE TO FACEBOOK AND I THINK -- THIS ONE THING TO NOTE ABOUT THIS PRACTICES IT'S A DIRECT RESULT OF THE RECIPROCITY ARRANGEMENTS THAT FACEBOOK EMPLOYS AND THERE'S GREAT DOCUMENTATION AT HAND BOTH FROM PUBLIC. API DOCUMENTATION AS WELL AS MORE RECENTLY LEAKED INTERNAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS PRACTICE THAT -- HIGHLIGHT NOT ONLY PRIVACY INVASIVE PRACTICES BUT ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES REQUIRING THAT ANYONE THAT USE THE FACEBOOK PLATFORM BE REQUIRED TO RETURN THE DATA THEY COLLECT AS AN APP DEVELOPER. BACK TO FACEBOOK SO IF I WANT TO COMPETE WITH FACEBOOK I'M REQUIRED TO IF I BUILD AN APP ON THEIR PLATFORM TO SHARE ALL THE DATA THAT I COLLECTED THESE ARE BACK TO THE COMPANY AS PART OF THEIR TERMS OF SERVICE. AND SO AS A JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ATTIC SOMETIMES THE MERE COLLECTION AND RETENTION CAN CAUSE GREAT PROB PRIVACY HARM. TO LAST WEEK A LIST OF TWO POINT FOUR MILLION INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATE ENTITIES WAS EXPOSED ON THE INTERNET THE LIST OF CURRENT AND FORMER POLITICIANS INDIVIDUALS. OR COMPANIES UNDER SANCTIONS SINCE OR CONVICTED OF HIGH PROFILE FINANCIAL CRIMES. LINKS TO TERRORISM OR DEEM SPECIAL INTERESTS PERSONS WAS COMPILED BY DOW JONES FROM. PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SOURCES AND THEN MADE FOR SALE AND SADLY THAT INFORMATION WAS NOT SECURED SO. RESEARCHERS WERE ABLE TO PULL AND DISCOVERS INFORMATION PUBLICLY ON THE INTERNET AND THIS FOLLOWS JUST TWO YEARS AGO WHEN THE DOW JONES HAD A SIMILAR BREACH OF PERSONALS -- PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR CONSUMERS BY THE SAME MECHANISM THEY ON SECURED A CLOUD STORAGE PROVIDER -- SO IF IT TELLS A DEFINITIVE HISTORY SAUCE ANYTHING IT'S OF THE STATE OF ONLINE PRIVACY HAS GOTTEN WORSE NOT BETTER IN THE LAST DECADE. SO TO SWITCH TO SEE CPAC YOU'VE HEARD A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE CPA TO AND HOW IT. OPERATES I KINDA WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FUNDAMENTAL BENEFITS OF THAT THE ARCHITECTURE PROVIDES SPECIFICALLY IT ALLOWS CONSUMERS TO OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF INFORMATION. FOR VALUABLE CONSIDERATION -- SAILOR SHARING OF INFORMATION FOR A FOR VITAL CONSIDERATION -- TO THIRD PARTIES THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH RIGHT SO -- ALL OF THE EXAMPLES I LAID OUT BE CREATED A COLLECTION OF INFORMATION WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE THE SUPPLEMENTAL SAILOR SHARING INFORMATIONS TO THIRD PARTIES RIGHT SO NOT THE FIRST PART IS NOT THE BUSINESS OF THE CONSUMERS KNOW AND TRUST. BUT THE THIRD PARTIES THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY RELATIONS. COMPANIES WILL BE PROHIBITED FROM SELLING OR SHARING AND CONSUMERS INFORMATION -- DATA BROKERS ATTRACT USERS OF THAT CONSENT WILL BE PROHIBITED FROM THIRD FURTHER SELLING INFORMATION -- AND BE REQUIRED TO DELETE INFORMATION BASED ON A VERIFIABLE CONSUMER REQUEST. SO WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT AS THE CURRENT PRIVACY FRAMEWORK THAT WE HAVE AS I SAID DOESN'T RESTRICT ANY THIRD PARTY SHARON. AND THE FTC HAS MADE EVIDENT BY THE TWENTY FOURTEEN DATA BROKE RECORD AND THEIR STORY HAS REALLY LIMITED JURISDICTION ON ON COMPANIES THAT THE COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH RIGHT TO THE QUESTION. THAT TO SEIZE PRIMARY AUTHORITY FUNCTIONS UNDER SECTION FIVE WHICH IS UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES. PRIMARILY PRIVACY CASES FALL UNDER DECEPTION WHICH IS WHAT CONSUMERS EXPECT A WHAT COMPANY SAID CONSUMERS CONSUMERS NEVER SEE. THIRD PARTIES PRIVACY POLICIES AND IN SOME CASES THE FTC DOESN'T CONSIDER OR HAS INDICATED THAT THOSE ARE LESS MATERIAL THAN THE ONES THAT CONSUMERS OF A FIRST PARTY. QUESTION SHIP WITH SO AS A RESULT CPA WILL PREVENT THAT THIRD PARTY. KIND OF COLLECTION AND FOCUS THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE USER AND WITH COMPANIES A CONSUMERS HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR BY STRENGTHENING I THINK THE FTC'S ABILITY TO ENFORCE THOSE CASES -- FOR THE MORE -- THE THE STREAM OF DESPITE WHAT YOU HEAR -- MUCH OVER THAT AS MR TIGER POINTED OUT MUCH OF THE PROVISIONS AROUND OPT OUT AND SELL PERSONAL INFORMATION PULL FROM DO NOT TRACK AND OTHER MULTI YEAR MULTI STAKEHOLDER PROCESSES WHICH INCLUDED. BROWSER MANUFACTURERS TECHNOLOGIST INDUSTRY ACTUALLY DID THE W. THREE C. WAS EVENTUALLY OVER RUN BY INDUSTRY IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THAT PROJECT -- IT ALSO FOLLOWS INTERESTING INDUSTRY PRACTICES FOR EXAMPLE -- IF YOU RUN A WEBSITE YOU CAN USE GOOGLE ANALYTICS TO PROVIDE ANALYTICS. I AM HE MAY USE IT ON THE EVEN THE THE SENATE'S WEBSITE HERE -- THAT SERVICE SINCE ITS INCEPTION HAS PROVIDED WAYS FOR YOU AS THE WEBSITE OPERATOR TO SEND GOOGLE INFORMATION AND HAVE GOOGLE APP TRACK YOUR VISITORS BUT RESTRICT GOOGLE FROM USING THAT INFORMATION FOR THEMSELVES OR SHARED WITH ANY THIRD PARTY. THAT FEATURE EXIST TODAY WHERE GOOGLE OPERATE AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AS DEFINED UNDER CC PERIOD AND FOR CONSUMERS THAT OPT OUT TO THE WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE PROVIDER ROLE AND RESTRICTED SELF FROM USING INFORMATION FOR ITS OWN PURPOSES. THE ONE I'M CRITICAL CLARIFICATION INDEED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. THINGS YOU HAVE AT IT IS THAT THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS AND ONE OF THE DEVIL'S THE CRITICAL DEVILS IS AROUND THIS ISSUE OF PSEUDO IDENTIFIERS. RIGHT SO NEARLY ALL OF THE CASES I DESCRIBED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DOW JONES DATA BREACH RELY ON PSEUDO AN IDENTIFIER SAID A SUIT IDENTIFIERS SIMPLY JUST A RANDOM NUMBER THAT I CAN ASSIGN. TO THAT YOU'RE PERMITTED IDENTIFIER FOR EXAMPLE YOUR MOBILE DEVICES ALL OF YOUR MOBILE DEVICES TODAY HAVE A HARDWARE IDENTIFIER THAT IS PERSISTENT TO THE DEVICE FOR THE LIFE OF THE DEVICE THAT NEVER CHANGES AND THIS IS IN FACT HOW. RETAILERS WILL TRACK YOU AS YOU WALK AROUND THE STREETS RIGHT SOMETIMES THAT RANDOMLY ASSIGNED MORE OFTEN THERE ARE YOU THERE ESSENTIALLY HASHES OF YOUR YOUR YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS OR YOUR JUST A WAY TO SCRAMBLE. SOMEONE'S EMAIL ADDRESS SO THAT IT'S NOT READABLE BUT THE WAY I SCRAMBLED IS CONSISTENT SUCH THAT IF YOU AND I BOTH HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT WILL ADDRESS WE KNOW WHAT OUR FIRST THE SAME PERSON BUT WE CAN TALK AND COAT. RIGHT AND SO -- IT IT'S IT'S A IT'S SLIGHTLY COMPLICATED BUT IT WOULD SIMPLY BE LIKE TAKING YOUR NAME HANNAH AND CHANGED BY LAW ONE LETTER -- BASICALLY ADDING ONE CHARACTER TO TO THE LETTER IN ORDER -- TO TO WOULD DEVELOP A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER AND WHY THAT MATTERS IS LIKE CURRENTLY THERE'S A PRACTICE IS A COMPANY CALLED DATA LOGICS FOR EXAMPLE THAT FACEBOOK EMPLOYEES WHERE BY -- WHEN YOU WALK INTO A CVS AND PURCHASE? AN ITEM LIKE A RAZOR BLADE THROUGH A LOYALTY PROGRAM -- IF YOU WITH THEIR LOYALTY CARD -- CVS IS ABLE TO SEND THEIR AND THAT PURCHASE HISTORY TO DATA LOGICS AND FACEBOOK ALSO SENDS THAT THE FACT THAT YOU'VE SEEN ADVERTISEMENT ABOUT SAY RAZOR BLADE TO THAT COMPANY. AND DID A LOT OF HIS ABLETON WITHOUT KNOWING YOUR NAME. BE ABLE TO TELL WHO. SAW THE AD FOR RAZORS AND THEN PURCHASED IN STORE THAT RAZOR BLADE AND THEY DO THIS ALL USING PSEUDO IDENTIFIERS SUCH A HASH IDENTIFIERS. IF YOU IF I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH IF -- UNLESS YOU ROAD AND FIRES ARE CONSIDERED PERSONAL INFORMATION NONE OF THE EXAMPLES I MENTION ABOVE WILL BE ADDRESSED BY THE LAW LIKE ESSENTIALLY WOULD COMPLETELY GOT CCPA A FEW EXAMS SEROTA FIRES OR OR CLASSIFY THEM AS YOU WOULD DE IDENTIFIED DATA OR AGGREGATE DATA WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT -- ADDITIONALLY THERE WERE SOME CRITICISMS AROUND THE VAGUENESS -- FOR EXAMPLE AROUND VERIFIABLE CONSUMER REQUEST OR THE DEFINITIONS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WAS BY DESIGN RIGHT TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC POLICY IS INCREDIBLY PLOT PROBLEMATIC AND IS USUALLY. OUTDATED BY THE TIME THE INK DRIES TO LEAVE ROOM TO THE FOR THE AG. TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE FOR EXAMPLE AROUND WHAT CONSTITUTES AS CAN A VERIFIABLE CONSUMER REQUEST FOR THE RIGHT TO ACCESS OR DELETE. IT ALLOWS THE AG TO PROMULGATE RULES. THAT ESSENTIALLY -- GUIDE HOW USERS CAN REQUEST TO DELETE INFORMATION AND SECURE MANNER WHILE STILL ALLOWING THE OPT OUT STANDARD TO BE LOWER AND ALLOW CONSUMERS TO OPT OUT OF FOR EXAMPLE PSEUDONYMOUS TRACKING. RIGHT IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE FLEXIBLE IN THE WAY. ADDITIONALLY THE DEFINITIONS -- THE FLEXIBILITY ON PERSONAL INFORMATION WILL ALLOW THE AG TO ADD OR CHANGE DEFINITIONS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES RIGHT THE NEXT THE NEXT PLATFORM ISN'T GOING TO BE A MOBILE PHONE IT'S GOING TO BE IN A OUR OUR VIRTUAL REALITY DEVICE THAT WE WEAR. OR SOME SORT OF BODY ITEM W. WHERE THAT WON'T HAVE AN INTERFACE OR WON'T HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF DEFINITIONS FOR WHAT WE CONSIDER PERSONAL AND FOR SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND THAT FLEXIBILITY IS IMPORTANT TO ADD -- FINALLY -- I THINK THIS MIGHT BE A BETTER POINT FOR MR TARGETS ATTORNEY BUT MY SUCCESS THAT THE EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER RELATIONSHIP IS COVERED. RIGHT AND THE PROVISION I THINK IT'S ONE OF FIVE D. EIGHT SAYS THAT THERE'S NO RIGHT OF DELETION IF A BUSINESS NEEDS TO COMPLY WITH AN LEGAL OBLIGATION. AND I THINK THERE'S A QUITE A NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA LAWS THAT BUSINESSES TO KEEP INFORMATION ABOUT EMPLOYEES. RIGHT SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE CITY PAY WOULD SUPERSEDE THOSE -- IMAGES RUSHED THROUGH FINALLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT BUSINESS RIGHT SO ONE QUICK ONE IMPORTANT POINT TO THINK ABOUT HIS -- WHAT I HAVE -- WHAT THE NEW YORK TIMES DID IN RESPONSE THE GPR IN EUROPE SO -- IN EUROPE. AS A RESULT OF SOME -- SOME OBLIGATIONS GPR NEW YORK TIMES DECIDED TO FOREGO THIRD PARTY AD NETWORKS. AND DO PRIMARILY SELF SO IF AND SELF TARGETED ADS ON THEIR OWN PLATFORM AND WAS QUICK AND REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THIS CHANGE WAS THAT IN IN THE TIME THEY'VE DONE THE STATE FOUND THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY HAD NO. REDUCTION IN THEIR BOTTOM LINE RIGHT THEY'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY -- PERFORM JUST AS WELL ITH AND THERE'S A DID YOU DAY ARTICLE -- IF YOU GUYS WHENEVER I'M HAPPY TO SEND ANY OF ACTUALLY I'M HAPPY TO SEND ANY OF THE REFERENCES IF THEY'RE HELPFUL -- THE OTHER POINT THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT. MOST SMALL BUSINESSES TODAY MORE AND MORE RELY ON CLOUD SERVICES SUCH AS GOOGLE AMAZON SALES FORCE AT CETERA. AND INCLUDING SCHOOLS NOW MOVING TO CLOUD INTO G. SWEET PRODUCTS. JUST LIKE SECURITY MY BELIEF IS THAT PRIVACY IS GONNA BE COMMODITIZED AND THAT MUCH OF THE FEATURES LIKE I DESCRIBED IN THAT GOOGLE ANALYTICS EXAMPLE. WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO TURN ON LAWS SIMILARLY FOR THE RIGHT OF ACCESS WHICH MOST OF THE CLOUD PLATFORMS PROVIDE OR FOR THE RIGHT OF DELETION -- FINALLY TO STEAL MISTER TAGGART'S MAC METAPHOR ABOUT THE AUTO INDUSTRY -- I THINK YOU SEE WILL APPEAR WILL PROMOTE MAR SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES AROUND USER DATA. RIGHT -- ULTIMATELY I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE TO THE BENEFIT OF BOTH CONSUMERS AND TO INDUSTRY. RIGHT SELECT THE INNOVATION IN AUTOMOBILE EMISSIONS THAT CALIFORNIA WAS LEADING ON I THINK THE CPA WILL ESSENTIALLY PROMOTE MORE PRIVACY PRESERVING PRACTICES WHICH YOU'RE ALREADY SEEING COMPANIES LIKE APPLE -- DUCKDUCKGO THE NEW YORK TIMES EVEN A BROWSER MAKER LIKE BRAVE THAT'S LEARNED HOW TO DO ADVERTISE TARGETED ADVERTISING WITHOUT REVEALING CONSUMERS DATA. THOSE PRACTICES ARE AN EMERGENCE IN THE SAME WAY THAT THAT --% ENVIRONMENTALLY EFFICIENT AUTOMOBILES HAVE BECOME KIND OF LEADING THE WAY AND ASKS BIG SOURCE OF INNOVATION AND A BIG SOURCE OF COMMERCE AT THE CALIFORNIA WILL DEFINITELY THE WAY -- FINALLY I WANT TO TOUCH ON THE OTHER EFFORTS TO WHY SAID WHY THINKS YOU CPA IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS AN APPROACH -- WHY EVEN DEADLY HEARD ABOUT A NUMBER OF EFFORTS FOR OMNIBUS PROBABLY PRIVACY? REGULATION AND THEY OFTEN INCLUDE FACIAL RECOGNITION LOCATION DISCRIMINATION A I'D BUY S. -- BISON ALGORITHMS AT CETERA. AND THE ISSUE IS THAT THESE MYRIAD OF ACT -- ISSUES THAT INVOLVE BOTH THE FIRST PARTY AND THE THIRD PARTY WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO A POLICY FRAMEWORK THIS BASED ON ENHANCE NOTICE AND CHOICE RIGHT IT WILL ULTIMATELY PUT THE BURDEN BECAUSE THE ISSUES ARE SO COMPLEX AND IT'S NOT A CLEAR CUT DIVISION BETWEEN FIRST PARTY AND THIRD PARTY. IT WILL PUT DATE THE ONUS ON THE USER TO DISCERN DISCERN WHETHER THE COLLECTION OF THEIR INFORMATION IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE TASK THAT THE BUSINESS IS GOING TO PROVIDE THEM AND THE CONSUMER HAD HAS TO STUDY. AND UNDERSTAND THE PRIVACY POLICIES AS WELL INTELLIGENCE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE BASED ON THE DISCLOSURE OF THAT INFORMATION AND I THINK THAT PUTS A HUGE BURDEN ON CONSUMERS AND BECOMES UNTENABLE I DON'T THINK IT GETS ANY. ANY FURTHER TO A KIND OF A PRIVACY REGIME RIGHT IT WILL ESSENTIALLY -- CONSUMERS WILL STILL WILL BE REQUIRED TO STILL READ AND UNDERSTAND PRIVACY POLICIES AND SOMETHING THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN. I AM. USING AS A WAY TO LEGITIMIZE THEIR CLUB PRACTICES ARGUING THAT -- THAT THESE PRACTICE ARE CLEARLY DEFINED AND PRIVACY POLICIES AND CONSUMERS SHOULD ESSENTIALLY -- NOT USE THE PRODUCTS OR READ THE PRIVACY POLICIES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PRODUCTS DO -- THIS FROM A SHOW OF HANDS WHO READS PRIVACY POLICIES. HE DO FOR EVERY SAY EVEN. TO RECOVERING LAWYER I FEEL OBLIGATED TO DO THEM NOW YOU CAN ALSO ASK DO YOU UNDERSTAND THEM AND WRITE MY GET A DIFFERENT RESPONSE RATE AND AND I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER CRITICAL PIECE TO TO KIND OF TO TO THE KIND OF POINT THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED AROUND THE THE FREE. COFFEE IN EXCHANGE FOR PERSONAL DATA -- OFTENTIMES CONSUMERS ARE TERRIBLE AT UNDERSTANDING HARMS THAT ARE KIND OF INFREQUENT AND FAR AWAY RIGHT SO -- BEHAVE ECONOMICS TELLS US THAT THERE'S HYPERBOLIC DISCOUNTING WE'RE GONNA. DISCOUNT BENEFITS TODAY -- FOR FOR A KIND OF RISK IN THE FUTURE AND THIS IS WHY WE HAVE SEAT BELT LAWS THIS IS WHY WE HAVE STE TEXTING LAWS THIS IS WHY WE HAVE INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. RECKONS CONSUMERS ARE TERRIBLE ASSESSING RISK PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE WAY INDIVIDUALS MIGHT USE THEIR DATA AND AND MERRY OUT OF CONTACTS. AND I THINK I'M ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS BY PUTTING FOR EXAMPLE BY MOVING TO AN OPT IN REGIME WHERE CONSUMERS HAVE TO ASSESS RISK OPT IN CONSENT TO THE USE OF THEIR INFORMATION. NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO UNDER. FOR IMMEDIATE BENEFITS -- DUE TO THE COULD BEHAVE ECONOMICS THEY'RE AWESOME AN EXPERIENCE OPT OUT FATIGUE WHERE THEY'RE JUST GONNA OPT INTO WHATEVER THE SERVICES LIKE FREE COFFEE. IN ORDER TO GET THAT BENEFIT TODAY AT THE RISK OF ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TOMORROW AND THE CHIMES THERE IS WITHOUT OFTEN CONSENT CONTENT COMPANIES CAN ACTUALLY DO MORE INVASIVE PRACTICES THAN THEY WOULD WITH THE CURRENT RGIME THAT'S STILL BEEN KIND OF DELEGATE WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH INFORMATION ETCETERA -- SO I I THINK FOR THIS REASON AND FOR FOR MANY OTHERS I HAVE A FRIEND KIND OF DESCRIBED. THAT THE NOTICE AND CHOICE FRAMEWORK ESSENTIALLY ASKS TOO MUCH OF PEOPLE AND TOO LITTLE OF THOSE ENTRUSTED WITH OUR DATA AND I THINK THAT ESSENTIALLY SUMS UP WHAT AT WHAT THE ISSUE WITH OPTIMUS -- MY FEELING IS GENERALLY CCPA BY PUTTING THE ONUS ON THIRD PARTY COLLECTION AND BUY AND FOCUSING INTERACTIONS WITH -- FIRST PARTIES THE CONSUMERS HAVE A KNOWING AND TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP WITH WILL -- HELP ADDRESS THESE THE LARGER ISSUES THAT I DESCRIBED TODAY -- AND I WILL WILL. KIND OF FIX THIS LARGELY UNREGULATED MARKET FOR CONSUMERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOTH VERY INTERESTING PERSPECTIVES ON THIS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR INFORMATION I AS YOU TALK ABOUT THE COFFEE WE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE IN WHAT OTHER INFORMATION WAS BEING. PROVIDED AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE WHAT WHAT ARE THEY CARE I WANT THE JOB BUT I WONDER WHEN THEY'RE A LITTLE OLDER AND IF THEY HAVE FAMILIES TO THEY WANT THAT INFORMATION BEING OUT THERE -- THAT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF CONCERN TO THEM I MEAN I I JUST THINK THAT -- IT'S THE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD CHOICES EVEN IF THEY DON'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND ALL ASPECTS OF IT -- WE TRIED TO DO PRIVACY LAW BACK IN TWENTY YEARS AGO WITH THE CENTERS BEER I DID A LEGISLATION AND THEY WERE OPT OUT AND THE COM THEY WERE SO COMPLICATED AND THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT APPEARED ON PAGE EIGHTEEN AND IN THE SMALLEST PRINT POSSIBLE. AND I OBSERVED AT THAT POINT IF IT WAS AN OPT IN SYSTEM IT WOULD BE CLEAR AS A BELL IN THAT OFFER YOU A FREE TOASTER TO GO WITH IT -- SO I THINK THAT AGAIN THERE ARE SOME OF THOSE PHILOSOPHICAL ANNONCES I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO RESPOND BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WANT. TO AND THEN I'LL INVITE ANYONE ELSE IF THEY HAVE A QUESTIONS ONE LITTLE POINT HERE YOU KNOW AND I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR. THAT MISTER ATTACKER AND MISTER SULTANI TALK ABOUT AND HOW THIS-BILL OVER THE SLOT IS NOT DESIGNED TO DECIMATE ON DIGITAL ADVERTISING FOR EXAMPLE. AND THAT'S AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU KNOW MANY OF THE SITES AND SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS. AT NO CHARGE BUT THEY ARE FUNDED THROUGH ADVERTISING AND THAT'S OUR SECRET I THINK THAT'S PRETTY BIG BECOME MUCH MORE VISIBLE. AND YOU KNOW WE MIGHT BE CREATING A SYSTEM AND IT AND I WAS INTERESTED IN WHAT MR SO TINY WAS TALKING ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF NOTICING CHOICE BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THE CCPA. INCLUDES MORE DETAILED AN ONEROUS NOTICES THAT ARE GONNA BE LINK FEAR THAN THE ONES THAT WE HAVE WHICH SEEMS SORT OF COUNTER TO THE GOAL OF MAKING FLIPSIDE WHAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT A NUMBER OF COMPANIES ARE DOING. THEIR LEVEL BEST I JUST CAME BACK FROM RSA WHERE WE CHANGE A GROUP I WAS JUST IN FREMONT WHERE FOUR HUNDRED YOU KNOW PEOPLE WERE THERE TO BE TRAINED. EXACTLY ON HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE CPA AND YOU'VE HEARD MANY OF THE OTHER PANELISTS TALKING ABOUT. THE EFFORT AND EXPENSE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO TO TRY TO MAKE NOTICES TRANSPARENT BECAUSE NOT ONLY I SAID TO THEM. YOU KNOW THAT IT IT JUST LEAVING ASIDE THE COMPLIANCE MYSTERY WHEN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT FRAMEWORK TO LOOK THINK LOOK AT THINGS. IT'S ALSO NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE BRAND I THINK YOU GUYS ALL SAW. A YOU KNOW SITUATIONS WHERE OF BRAND VALUE HAS BEEN AS FINO NOT CALCULATED APPROPRIATELY AND STOCK PRICES TANK. THAT'S NOT IN ANY BUSINESSES INTERESTING SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT. IS HAVING THAT YOU KNOW -- AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING MR SO TINY WAS SAYING THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE AN US AND THEM. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO HAVE A SOPHISTICATED DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW AS A COMMUNITY. NOT JUST ON BUSINESS REGULATORS LEGISLATORS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESS WORK TOGETHER TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS DIGITAL AGE. BECAUSE YES THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE WITHOUT DIGITAL ADVERTISING FOR EXAMPLE BUT THEN YOU HAVE WHOLE SWATHS OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO PAY. FOR THE IN A FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR I EXCUSE ME YOU KNOW. ACTIONS THAT MIGHT BE OBLIGATED TO BE PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS IT AND I WE READ THESE AWAY SO CAN COURT YOU'VE DONE EDUCATED DISCUSSION ARTICULATED I THINK WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE THIS IS NOT AN US VERSUS THEM. WE'RE TRYING TO PRIORITIZE AS I MENTIONED THE THE RESPONSIBILITIES WE HAVE TO THE PUBLIC TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT ABOUT A MILLION EACH BY THE WAY THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND YOU HEARD THE NUMBERS 80% WANT US TO DO MORE ON THEIR PRIVACY ON THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE WANT THOSE ADVERTISEMENTS AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE HERE IS TRYING. TO UNDERMINE THAT WE JUST WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO A CONSENT OR NOT TO CONSENT TO IT'S A RIGHT TO KNOW -- THE ABILITY TO MAKE THAT CHOICE TO CONSENT OR NOT AND THEN -- HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO PROCEED FORWARD SOME OF THE THINGS HE WAS SAYING MISTER SOLTANI THAT. I JUST ENVISIONED IF -- SOME BAD ACTOR GOT A HOLD OF ALL THIS INFORMATION THE WAY THEY COULD CONTROL ALA. BRAVE NEW WORLD IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR I MEAN IT'S IT'S HERE IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY AT THE SAME TIME. I I THINK MOST OF US. OPERATE FROM THE BASIS OF MOST ACTORS MOST OF THESE COMPANIES WANT TO BE GOOD ACTORS AND THAT'S PART OF THE DISCUSSION HERE TODAY HOW DO WE CAN GREATER CLARITY WHAT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF OUR CONSUMERS. AND THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA'S MADE PRIVACY OF A RIGHT FUNDAMENTAL WITHIN OUR CONSTITUTION. OTHER ANY OTHER COMMENTS. QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY OUR pLAST. OF PANEL INDUSTRY MODELS INNOVATING TO INCORPORATE PRIVACY INTO THE BUSINESS MODEL -- I THINK THIS IS. AN A HAVE PRIORITIZE SEE AND ARE FUNCTIONING. SUCCESSFULLY AS WELL I HEARD DOCTOR GOAL MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOCTOR GO IS BUT I'M TOO OLD TO KNOW SO. LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR TESTIMONY MISTER WEINBERG AND MISTER WEAVER WILL START WITH YOU TODD WE WERE IS THE FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF PURISM. THAT'S RIGHT THANK VERY GOOD THANK YOU CHAIRMAN JACKSON AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M HONORED. TO BE HERE. MY NAME'S TOMMY -- AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND BOTH GABRIEL AND I ARE QUITE UNUSUAL WITNESSES FROM THE TECH SECTOR. HERE TODAY. THIS IS BECAUSE WE ARE HERE'S THE CEOS OF GROWING TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES PROTECT PRIVACY. RATHER THAN EXPLOIT. THIS IS BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY HERE CALLING FOR MUCH STRONGER CONSUMER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE WORLD NOT WEAKER ONES. I BELIEVE THE DEFAULT APPROACHING CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE THE RIGHT TO OPT IN. RATHER THAN REQUIRING ALL OF US TO HAVE TO INCONVENIENTLY OPT OUT OF THE EXPLOITATION OF OUR MOST PERSONAL DATA. ACROSS ALL SOFTWARE. EACH SERVICE AND EVERY SITE WE USE. AS MR ATTACKER WHO MIGHT LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT. THE THANKS FOR HIS TIRELESS YEARS OF EFFORT ON AB. THREE SEVEN FIVE APPROPRIATE STATED A DO NOT TRACK BROWSER EXTENSION BACKED BY LAW IS HELPFUL. FOR PROTECTIONS ON WEBSITES BUT MRS. ON THE WIDELY POPULAR APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES. THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WE NEED TO PROTECT PERSONAL PRIVACY BY DEFAULT. I ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORT HOLDING COMPANIES LIKE MINE. ACCOUNTABLE. IN COURT IF WE VIOLATE A PERSON'S PRICE PRIVACY RIGHTS. RIGHTS WHICH WE ARE GUARANTEED IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION. BUT I BELIEVE OUR LAWS DO NOT YET FULLY RESPECT WHEN IT COMES TO THE INTERNET. I'M HERE O TELL YOU IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA'S EXTRAORDINARY TECH INDUSTRY TO STOP HARVESTING AND SHARING OUR MOST PERSONAL PRIVATE DATA WITHOUT ARE MEANINGFUL CONSENT [inaudible] AND KNOWLEDGE. YOU WILL HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND I BELIEVE THE TIME IS LONG OVERDUE. NOW YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF BUSINESSES AND TECH COMMUNITY SUGGESTING CALIFORNIA'S NEW PRIVACY LAW IF NOT SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDED WHICH OF COURSE MEANS WEEKEND BEFORE IT IS ALLOWED TO GOING TO A FACT IS GOING TO CAUSE EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS HARDSHIP AND CONFUSION. THESE ARE OF COURSE THE SAME ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY MANY OF THESE SAME COMPANIES REGARDING EUROPE'S GPR. BUT SINCE YOU THE P. R. WENT INTO EFFECT THESE COMPANIES HAVE CONTINUED TO BE JUST FINE. AND IN MOST CASES OF GROWING PROFITS. THAT IS REAL EVIDENCE. THAT CALIFORNIA'S NEW PRIVACY LAW IS NOT GOING TO DESTROY THE INTERNET COMMERCE AS WE NOTE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE OR STRONGER. PROTECTIONS JUST LIKE THOSE IN G. P. ARE ARE NOT GOING TO BE HARD TO IMPLEMENT. THE KEY IS WHETHER WE COMPANIES ARE WILLING TO SIMPLY BEGAN TO HONOR OUR CUSTOMERS PRIVACY RIGHTS BY DESIGNING OUR SERVICES TO BE PRIVACY PROTECTING BY DEFAULT. RATHER THAN PRIVACY EXPLOITING BY DEFAULT. IS THIS POSSIBLE YES I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT MY GROWING COMPANY WAS FOUNDED ON THE SIMPLE PRINCIPLE THAT PRIVACY IS A RIGHT AND NEEDS TO BE THE DEFAULT IN ALL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. BUT MAYBE CLEAR. TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS CAN ABSOLUTELY IN BE ROOTED IN MORAL VALUES AND STILL LEAD INNOVATION. SOCIETIES TECHNOLOGY GENIUS IS NOT LACKING. IT'S MORAL GENIUS IS. AND THIS IS WHERE YOU. COME IN. TECHNOLOGIES INNOVATION THE COMPLIES WITH PRIVACY PROTECTION IS EASY. LET ME RESTATE IT. IT'S EASY TO OPERATE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS WHILE PLAYING BY THE RULES YOU SET. I STARTED PURISM WHEN I CAME TO REALIZE THAT MY TWO DAUGHTERS LIKE ALL CHILDREN NEED CONVENIENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO PROTECT THEM. RATHER THAN EXPLOIT THEM. AS A TECHNOLOGIST I AM I UNDERSTAND PAINFULLY WELL. HOW MUCH THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR-CAN EXPLOIT MY KIDS WITH THESE? FOR EXAMPLE AS EACH OF YOU CRITICAL POLICY HOLDERS WILL COME TO REALIZE YOUR SMARTPHONE'S TRACK YOUR EXACT LOCATION. AND EVERYTHING DONE ON THAT DEVICE EVERY MILLISECOND OF EVERYDAY AND RECORD THAT PERSONAL DATA PERMANENTLY FOR RETRIEVAL AT ANY POINT IN THE FUTURE. NOT FORGETTING EVERY SIR SHOT MESSAGE PHOTO VIDEO OR EVERY ARTICLE YOU FOR IT. SEARS ABOUT NEWS. THE CURRENT UNREGULATED. EXPLOITATION OF MODELS IN USE TODAY ENSURE EVERYTHING YOU DO IN THE DIGITAL WORLD LEAVES EXACTING PRIVACY INVADING EXCRUCIATING DETAIL ABOUT YOU PERMANENTLY. THAT'S WHY IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I STARTED PURISM. IT'S A SOCIAL PURPOSE COMPANY COMPLETELY FOUNDED ON PRIVACY PROTECTION PRINCIPLES. PRISONS ALREADY MANUFACTURING IN CALIFORNIA. AND ASSEMBLING THESE LAPTOPS RIGHT HERE INCLUDING THE OPERATING SYSTEM APPLICATIONS AND BUNDLED SERVICES THAT WILL NOT TRACK YOU PERIOD. PEARSON IS GROWING TRIPLE DIGITS YEAR OVER YEAR. FUTURE INNOVATION AND JOB CREATION AROUND PRIVACY BY DESIGN IS THE FUTURE THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LEAD ON CONSUMER DEMAND FOR PRIVACY IS A REAL. AND HAPPENING AND NEEDS TO BE THE DEFAULT. THIS YEAR WILL BE MANUFACTURING SECURITY AND PRIVACY DESIGNED PHONE THAT BUNDLE SERVICES AND COMPLY IS ALREADY WITH AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE BUT LEAVING GO FURTHER WITH OFTEN BY DEFAULT. FOR ALL OFFERED SERVICES. USE THESE PHONES IN YOUR MOST SENSITIVE DETAILS WILL BE UNDER YOUR CONTROL AND KEPT COMPLETELY PRIVATE. ISN'T THAT A CONFIDENCE LEVEL WE ALL SHOULD HAVE. THIS IS DONE BY SIMPLE APPROACH IT'S CALLED PRIVACY BY DESIGN. THIS IS AN APPROACH ALL TECH COMPANIES CAN IMPLEMENT IF THEY ARE TRULY COMMITTED TO PRIVACY. BEYOND THAT JUST MARKETING SLOGANS. AS AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE SIX TO MAKE CLEAR PRIVACY IS A RIGHT. AND YOUR EVERY LOCATION IN EVERY COMMUNICATION IN EVERY WEB PAGE AND EVERY SEARCH STORED PERMANENTLY SHOULD NOT BE EXPLOITED TO USE NEEDED SERVICES ONLINE. I STONGLY SUGGEST THE TIMES COME FOR CALIFORNIANS TO TAKE BACK THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY ON THE INTERNET. AND URGE YOU TO SUBSTANTIALLY STRENGTH IN THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY AB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE FOR YOUR IN MY CHILDREN'S SAKE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISSED WEINBERG WITH DUCKDUCKGO -- YOU ARE THE FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE YOUR WELCOME MY HELL TO FROM PENNSYLVANIA. AND I I DID. I'M THIS IS ONLY FIVE MINUTES -- SO -- I'M HERE TO BASICALLY REPRESENT AN ALTERNATE VIEWPOINT THAT -- THE CPA IN MY BELIEF IS ACTUALLY PRO BUSINESS NOT ANTI BUSINESS IN THE LONG RUN -- IN MANY WAYS KIND OF LIKE -- A COLLEAGUE HERE I COME TO YOU FROM THE FUTURE I RUN A BUSINESS THAT'S ALREADY CCA CCC HEY COMPLIANCE. AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT IT'S NOT A LIABILITY IT'S ACTUALLY AN ASSET FOR US SO I WANT TO BE A BIT A BIT OF BACKGROUND ABOUT. MY COMPANY AND THEN I HAVE THREE REALLY BRIEF POINTS -- ON THE SEA OF THE TO GO LIKE YOU MENTIONED I FOUND THE COMPANY IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OUR PRIMARY SERVICE IS A SEARCH ENGINE ALTERNATIVE TO GOOGLE THAT DOESN'T TRACK YOU -- THAT ALLOWS YOU JUST LITERALLY TO CERTAIN HONESTLY ONTHE WEB AND SO WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE CONCEPT OF A SEARCH HISTORY WHEN YOU COME TO US. IT'S LIKE IT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE BEEN THERE EVERY TIME -- WE ALSO OFFER PRIVACY BROWSER THAT'S AN ALTERNATIVE TO CHROME THAT BLOCKS ALL THOSE HIDDEN TRACKERS THE LAST PANEL SPOKE ABOUT AS YOU CAN BROWSE THE WEB. AND TOGETHER THEY KIND OF GIVE CONSUMERS THE PRIVACY ESSENTIALS THEY NEED AS THEY USED WEB -- I'M HAPPY TO LIKE TALK ABOUT ALL THAT STUFF BUT SINCE THE LAST PANEL TALK ABOUT IT AMERICAN SKIPPER ALL THAT -- WHAT I LIKE TO TELL YOU IS THAT WE'VE BEEN PROFITABLE SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T TRACK ANYBODY OUR PRIVACY POLICY IN A NUTSHELL IS WE DON'T COLLECT OR SHARE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION AT ALL. SO THE QUESTION I ALWAYS GET NEXT IS WELL HOW DO YOU MAKE ANY MONEY -- AND YOU'LL BE SURPRISED IN OTHER WE MAKE MONEY THROUGH ADVERTISING -- IT'S JUST CALL CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING AND IT'S REALLY THE WAY GOOGLE STARTED TO WHEN YOU TYPE IN A SEARCH LIKE CAR YOU GET AN AD FOR A CAR. I DON'T NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU TO DO THAT BASED ON THE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION THAT YOU GAVE THAT SAME CONCEPT BY THE WAY WORKS ON LIKE THE NEAR TIMES ARE PUBLISHING WEBSITE. OR A VIDEO THANK YOU TO HE JUST KIND OF PLAY AN AD THAT IS LIKE THE CONTENT OF THE VIDEO AND NOT ABOUT YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL -- SO THE FIRST POINT I REALLY LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT. CONTEXTUALIZED TIES THE AND IS IN HERE IN THE PRIVACY FRIENDLY. AND IN CONTRAST TO THE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING THAT'S KIND OF TAKEN OVER THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING MARKET IN THE LAST TEN YEARS -- WHEN I STARTED TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND ACTUALLY WHAT IT HADN'T TAKEN OVER THE MARKET GOOGLE IN FACT? WAS STILL MAINLY CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING EVEN. THE ADVERTISING AND IT PUT AROUND THE WEB WAS CONTEXTUAL IN THEIR PROTOCOL AT CENTS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS IT SHIFTED. BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY THE CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING COULD NOT BE AS PROP PHILLIP PAY REAL ADVERTISING AND I WANTED TO THE SAME POINT ASKING MAKE WHICH IS THAT THE NEW YORK TIMES REALLY JUST DID THIS TEST. AFTER GPR IN EUROPE AND THEY GOT RID OF ALL BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING AND THEY MADE MORE MONEY -- AND SO I THINK IT IS A WORKABLE -- BUSINESS MODEL -- THE SECOND POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT CONSUMERS. ACTUALLY WANT TO USE BRANDS THAT THEY TRUST SO. WE HAVE BEEN ATTRACTING CONSUMERS -- YEAR OVER YEAR I A GROWING FIFTY AND A 100% AND NOW WE DO ABOUT A BILLION SEARCHES A MONTH. FOR THE THIRD OR FOURTH LARGEST SEARCH ENGINE IN MOST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD -- ALL BASED ON OUR PRIVACY PROMISES ALL ORGANIC GROWTH -- OUR MAIN CHALLENGES KIND OF GETTING THE WORD OUT BUT AS PEOPLE LEARN THERE'S A PRIVACY ALTERNATIVE. THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF WALKING TO THIS -- I DON'T THINK WE'RE AN ISOLATED CASE -- I THINK -- BY CONTRAST PRIVACY RESPECTING BUSINESS MODELS. ARE KEY ATTRACTORS FOR CONSUMERS AND THE ANTI PRIVACY BUSINESS MODELS ARE QUITE CLEARLY ON THE ROPES LIKE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE SERVICES THAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE EXPORTING THEIR INFORMATION. I MAKE AN ANALOGY TO BUSINESSES -- KIND OF GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY TO ADDRESS THE CARBON FOOTPRINT -- EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE TO AND THAT ATTRACTS CONSUMERS -- I THINK IN THE SAME WAY THAT -- BUSINESSES EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THE LAW WOULD BE WELL SERVED TO BCC OKAY COMPLIANT ACROSS THE COUNTRY BECAUSE IT THE CAN CAN USE THAT AS A AS A AS A TRACTOR. FOR THE THIRD POINT I JUST LIKE TO MAKE IS. I'M REALLY IN SUPPORT OF THE CCAC CPA BROADLY INCENTIVIZING DATA MINIMIZATION SO I VIEW THAT AS ONE OF THE KEY -- POINTS THAT THE LAW IS DOING -- ONE APPROACH TO COMPLIANCE IS BASICALLY TO COLLECT AND SHARE LESS PERSONAL INFORMATION -- AT THE EXTREME AND ZERO LIKE US -- THIS IS GREAT BECAUSE COUNTRY TO POPULAR BELIEF MOST DATA COLLECTED ACTUALLY DOES NOT DRIVE BUSINESS INTERESTS IT'S OFTEN A LIABILITY -- WHEN DATA BREACHES HAPPEN THESE COMPANIES LOSE MARKET SHARE NOT GAIN OUT IN THERE THE DAY IT WAS JUST SITTING AROUND DOING NOTHING -- THE AND SAID THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN IS. YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN NO REAL COST ASSOCIATE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO MAKE THEM DO THE MINIMIZATION THIS BRINGS THAT COST AN AND A REALLY INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES. TO DO THE MINIMIZATION AND THEN THE LAST -- RELATED POINT LIKE TO MAKE IS KIND OF WHAT THAT'S CONNECTED I REALLY LIKE TO UNDERSCORE IT. IS THAT -- I'D BE WARY OF TO TO ANONYMOUS DATA -- TIME AND TIME AGAIN THIS IS PROVEN TO BE A FICTION IT'S A FICTIONAL CONCEPT -- ANY DATA THAT I'VE EVER SEEN RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC THAT INCLUDES. A DATA SET THAT'S TIED TOGETHER TO AN INDIVIDUAL EVEN DOESN'T COULD IDENTIFIER JUST THESE KIND OF HALF IS THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. ALWAYS HAS BEEN THE ANONYMIZED IN THE SEARCH -- INDUSTRY INTO AND SIX A WELL RELEASED A FEW TO ANONYMOUS SEARCH DATA SET THE JUST HAD QUERIES TIED TOGETHER WITH NO PEOPLE ASSOCIATED. IT WAS THE ANONYMIZED THAT'S IT. THE SIDE FUNNY STORY BECAUSE MONTH SEARCH HOW TO KILL MY WIFE AND THEY FIGURED OUT IT WAS AND IT WAS LIKE A RIGHT I CRIME WRITER A TV WRITER -- NETFLIX DID THE SAME THING THEY RELEASED THE RESEARCH DATA SAID ON A MOVIE RECOMMENDATIONS AND PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO THE ANONYMIZE THAT THERE'S BEEN CREDIT CARD ONCE IN ALL CASES WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY TAKE ANOTHER DATA SET. AND THEY PUT IT TOGETHER WITH THE PSEUDO ANONYMOUS DATA AND THEN IF YOU GRAVITY BLOCKS. SO I WOULD BE JUST WARY OF ANYONE WHO KIND OF CLAIMS OR ANY. ANY. BODY COUNT OF FOR YOU AND SAYS OF THE SUIT ANONYMOUS THAT AS A THING. SO IN CONCLUSION OUR MISSION ADDUCT AGO HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO SET A NEW SANDARD TRUST ONLINE. AND THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT -- THE CCP TEN MINUTES. WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMING OUT FROM PENNSYLVANIA THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM. THE DíAS I I HAVE ONE QUESTION -- YOU STARTED YOUR COMPANIES WITH THAT COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY -- COMPANIES THAT ARE MOVED BEYOND THAT AND ARE NOW USING -- A BEHAVIORAL -- ADVERTISE ADVERTISING AND IN SOME OF THESE MORE AGGRESSIVE. LESS OF PRIVACY FRIENDLY PRACTICES. IS IT GOING TO BE. IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO PULL BACK AND START. RE KIND OF RE CONFIRMING A REAFFIRMING A COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY HOW IS THAT GOING TO IMPACT THEIR CURRENT MODELS. YEAH I I DON'T THINK SO I MEAN -- I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS THE LARGEST COMPANIES HERE -- TALK ABOUT GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK BECAUSE THEY'RE DRIVING IN. MOST OF THE ADS ON MOST OF THESE OTHER SITES -- AND THE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING ALL YEAR ROUND SO YOU DO THE ONE GOOGLE SEARCH AND THEN IT'S YOU KNOW IF YOU SEARCH FOR SOME PANTS AND THE FOLLOWING YOU AROUND EVERYWHERE -- THAT COULD JUST BE BACK TO JUST SHOWING DO A COULD SHOW AN AD JUST BASED ON THE PUBLISHER WEBSITE -- I ACTUALLY THINK IN THE LONG RUN THAT'LL MAKE THE MORE MONEY I THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING INCREASINGLY ANNOYED BY THESE CREEPY ADS. AND THEY'RE GETTING LESS COLLECTS OVER TIME NOT MORE AND SOARING THIS WEIRD PERIOD WHERE IT MADE A BIT MORE MONEY BUT I THINK THEY'RE OVER TIME TO REALIZE THAT IT'LL BE MORE MONEY TO GO BACK TO GET TEXTILE ANYWAY. SO WHAT ABOUT ALEXA AND WHAT ABOUT THE SERVICE SYSTEMS NOW THAT SEEM TO BECOMING MORE AND MORE PREVALENT. WHERE? PEOPLE ARE RELYING ON THESE. VERBAL CUES TELLING PETE TELLING THIS THING TO GO AHEAD AND ADJUST THE THERMOSTAT OR PLAY MUSIC OR WHO KNOWS WHAT THINGS WE USED TO DO BY. OURSELVES WALKING OVER TO THE THERMOSTAT FOR EXAMPLE BUT RECOGNIZING IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD HOW ARE IS THAT INFORMATION -- I KNOW IT'S BEING. A YOU KNOW. PULLED INTO WHO KNOWS WHERE AND IT'S BEING USED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES. IS THERE SOME WAY THAT PEOPLE COULD CONTINUE OR THAT THESE COMPANIES CONTINUE PROVIDING THAT SERVICE WITHOUT IT BEING SO INCREDIBLY INVASIVE OF OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ABSOLUTELY SO INTRICATE REAL. LOW GRADE ON THAT POINT -- SO THERE'S THERE'S NO OLOGY DONE MORALLY. RIGHT WE CAN DO ALL THE GREAT STUFF THE EVERYBODY WANTS. BUT JUST DON'T GO TO THE CREEPY LEVEL. AND IT'S THERE'S NO HARM. IN PROVIDING. CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION OR THE SEARCH RESULTS YOU WANT. BY HAVING IT BE. JUST EXACTLY WHAT IT IS YOU'RE ASKING. FOR SO TECHNOLOGY CAN ADVANCE INNOVATION CAN ABSOLUTELY ADVANCE. BUT WE CAN STILL PROTECT PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALS. YEAH THEY'RE THEY'RE TO THE WHEN DR WAY DR GO WORKS IS WHEN YOU DO A SEARCH WE ASK YOUR SURGEON THROWN AWAY. WHEN YOU USE GOOGLE HOME AND YOU'D TYPE YOU KNOW YOU SAY SOME TEAR DEVICE THEY SAVE THAT FOREVER THERE'S A REASON ANY TO SAVE THAT THEY CAN ANSWER IT AND THROW IT AWAY? THANK YOU -- CENTER COVER YET. I I DIDN'T GET TO HEAR EVERYONE TODAY SO I APOLOGIZE BUT I I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS HERE TODAY BECAUSE PART OF THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT. AS WE STARTED USING THE DEVICS -- THEY HAD LIMITED I REMEMBER BACK IN THE DAY WHEN THE CELL PHONE WAS LIKE A BRICK AND IT WAS NOT EASY TO USE -- AND AND SO IT'S OVER TIME GOTTEN MORE AND MORE INTRUSIVE AND I I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS TRACKING THINGS UNTIL LIKE YOU SAID THESE CREEPY ADD START POPPING UP EVERY PLACE THAT I BEEN ASKING ME CAN. YOU ONE IF YOU WANT TO RATE THE RESTAURANTS AND AND IT NOW TELLS ME THAT TIME TRAVEL HOME NEVER PUT MY HOME IN HERE BUT MY TRAVEL HOME. HOW LONG IT TAKES ME TO GET THERE AND WHETHER THE TRAFFIC IS PARTICULARLY BAD THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS GREAT BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN SAY TO HAVE DINNER BECAUSE IT'S GONNA TAKE ME A LOT LONGER? BUT BUT TIM REALIZED THAT THAT INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY BEING TRACKED AND SOLD AND USED AND AND MORE AND MORE ARE NOW COMING THAT WERE WHERE I MAY HAVE JUST PASSED PLACE I HAVEN'T STOPPED I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING IT. I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I CAN GET IN HERE AND AND AND STOP SOME OF THE TRACKING BUT I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT EASILY. PARTLY BECAUSE SOME OF THE SITES WILL ASK ME DO YOU CAN I HAVE YOUR CONTACTS AND YOUR PHOTOS AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. FOR THOSE PARTICULAR APPLICATIONS I PUSH NO. THIRD BECAUSE NOW I KNOW AND I CAN'T USE THE UP AT ALL RIGHT AND SO I IT IT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THERE ARE SOLUTIONS AND THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO ADVANCE -- THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES THAT MAKE LIFE EASIER -- BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO BE HACKED DIED AT THE BABY MONITORS IT YOU CAN YOU CAN GET ON THE THAT CAN BE HACKED AND PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR HOUSE. THAT KIND THAT KIND OF THING REALLY FRIGHTENS ME AND I THINK FOR SOMEONE THAT'S OLD LIKE MYSELF. I GET CAUTIOUS AND I AND I DON'T SIGN UP FOR THEM BUT I KNOW THAT YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE SAYING YES TO EVERYTHING AND I'VE SEEN THEM WHEN THEY GO ON A JUST GO YES YES YES YES YES YES THEY DON'T IT'S NOT THERE'S NO READING OR FIGURING IT OUT. SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE KINDS OF PROTECTIONS THAT ARE REALLY GOING. TO TO HELP. AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR YOU'VE GOT A FROM COMING OUT I WANT TO I WANT TO SEE AND I WANNA I WANT -- I WANT SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GOING -- TO TO TRACK ME AND I FEEL LIKE I MET RESPONSE WITH REAL QUICK ABOUT VERY QUICKLY IN FROM THE HASSLE. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING OUR ABSOLUTE POSSIBLE TO DO WITHOUT ACTUALLY INVADING YOUR PRIVACY SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN ADVANCE FASTER THAN YOUR MIND CAN HANDLE. WHILE STILL PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY THE INNOVATION AND JOBS CREATED AROUND THE REGULATION IS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT. AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA UNDERSTANDS HOW VALUABLE THAT IS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GREAT. VERY HELPFUL INSIGHTS I THINK FROM ALL THE PANELISTS THIS IS REALLY. I KNOW I'VE BEEN INCREDIBLY INFORMED AND WE'RE GOING TO START REFERRING TO THE CREEPY FACTOR NOW -- AND SOME OF THIS IS CREEPY -- BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE A SERVICES HERE I'LL HAVE TO ASK MY YOUNGER STAFF TO HELP ME. GET ON THOSE SERVICES I COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF. BUT WE DO HAVE TO BE FLEXIBLE I THINK WE DO NEED TO PRIORITIZE -- PRIVACY IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND THE SAME TIME IF THEIR WAYS THAT WE CAN -- PROTECT THAT AT THE SAME TIME. RECOGNIZE THAT THE TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE SOME OF THEM ARE JUST EXTRAORDINARY AND VERY HELPFUL TO US AND AND YOU'VE CERTAINLY MADE IT CLEAR THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT TO BE THE CASE. SO WITH THAT WILL OPEN IT UP IF THEY'RE IN OF THERE IS A MICROPHONE HERE. IF YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND TWO MINUTES PLEASE. NEXT -- CHRIS ROSE ARE PRESENTING THE NONPROFIT ALLIANCE WITH THE CCPA WAS BEING NEGOTIATED DRAFTED LAST YEAR LEGISLATORS EXEMPTED NON PROFITS FROM THE BILL AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZING THE CLEAR INTENT TO EXCLUDE. NON PROFITS FROM THE DIRECT HITS OF THE COSTLY IMPACT OF THIS LEGISLATION. HOWEVER IT NONPROFIT STONE OPERATE IN A VACUUM WE USE CONSUMER DATA AND THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS TO ENSURE OUR PROGRAMMATIC IN FUNDRAISING. MARKETING MESSAGES ARE DELIVERED TO THOSE MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT AND LIKEWISE. TO THOSE WHO WILL NOT. NONPROFITS DO NOT HAVE A PROFIT MARGIN THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BLANKET THE STATE WITH TO EVERY RESIDENT TO SEE. WHO WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE SIERRA CLUB FOR EXAMPLE HOWEVER THEY WILL KNOW THAT IF YOU BUY HIKING BOOTS FROM ARI I? YOU'RE LIKELY TO SUPPORTNATURE CONSERVANCY EFFORTS IT'S MORE EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE AND BETTER FOR POTENTIAL DONORS. OF NON PROFITS TO USE DATA IN A WAY TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE. WE ALSO USE. DATA FOR TIME TO FOR FILLER PROGRAMMATIC MISSIONS. A. R. P. IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW WE DO THAT TWIN SENIORS ARE CLOSING THEMSELVES OFF FROM THE WORLD IN GETTING ISOLATED AND THEN THE NEXT DOMINO TO FALL IS THAT THEY START TO FAIL. WE USE DATA TO FIND TO THE SENIORS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WAVE THEIR HANDS UP AND SAY HEY CAN SOMEONE HELP ME WE USED IT TO FIND THEM AND THEN TO CONNECT THEM. TO VITAL SERVICES. THE LEGISLATIVE EXEMPTIONS THERE FOR OUR WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THEM AS THEY SAID AND THEY ARE WELL INTENTIONED BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE THE FIRST TO HIT. BE HIT WITH THE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF OF THE C. C. P. A.. WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED WITH IN OF SUFFERING FROM THE FULL IMPACT OF THE CHANGES IS WHEN OUR COMMERCIAL PARTNERS ARE FORCED TO GIVE US AN ULTIMATUM REGARDING THE COMPLIANCE OF OF THE CC PA WHICH IS PAY US MORE? DUE TO CUT -- COMPLIANCE COSTS OR CEASE ENTIRELY YOUR OUTREACH 212% OF THE US POPULATION RESIDING IN CALIFORNIA. INCREASINGLY NOT SURPRISINGLY CAL IN THE COUNTRY -- THEY REPRESENT AS MUCH AS 20% OF THE FUND RAISING SUPPORT TO ALL NATIONAL CHARITIES. THEIR SUPPORT -- THERE. PERSONAL VALUE TO SMALLER STATES AND REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE THAT MUCH MORE EVEN GREATER SO IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT RESTRICTING THE ABILITY TO REACH CALIFORNIA DONORS. DUE TO THE COST OF THIS YOU SEE PA WILL BE DEVASTATING TO NON PROFITS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED WE HADN'T TALKED ABOUT NON PROFITS BUT APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR INSIGHTS AND I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON. AND SENATORS BEN HAVING COME AFTER THE NATIONAL PAYROLL REPORTING CONSORTIUM WE HAVE SIMILAR CONCERNS TO THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE RELATED. TO APPLICABILITY OF THE ACT TO EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION -- WE THINK THERE WAS NOT AN INTENT TO INCLUDE THAT INFORMATION THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE POLICY. A DISAGREEMENT BUT I'VE HEARD LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS ALL ACROSS THE MAP WITH RESPECT TO THIS ISSUE AND I THINK IT'S ONE AREA THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM SOME CLARIFICATION IF THERE'S NOT A POLICY DISAGREEMENT SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. CLARIFYING THAT ISSUE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL PARTIES THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR MIKE BELOW IT I WANT TAKE TWO MINUTES -- I WOULD ASSOCIATE MYSELF AND WITH MR EBANKS COMMENTS I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TROUBLE FINDING COMMON GROUND ON SOME ISSUES BUT I THINK THE ISSUE OF EMPLOYEES AS EMPLOYEES. NOT BEING CONSUMERS IS SOMETHING THEY A COUPLE OTHER TARGETED THINGS -- MISTER MCTAGGART AND OTHERS REFERRED TO THE QUESTION OF SHARING RECALL DATA SO YOU CAN GET CARS FIXED FOR SAFETY I THINK -- THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD PROBABLY ALL GREE ON SOME TARGETED ISSUES IN TERMS OF CONFORMITY WITH THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT IS SOMETHING WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE ON I DON'T AGREE THAT ANY. CHANGE IN THE PACKAGE IS SYNONYMOUS WITH WEAKENING IT I THINK THAT WE CAN. A PULLED THE MISSION THAT YOU'VE ALL UNDERTAKEN HERE BUT MAKE SOME TARGETED CHANGES AND WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER BLOOD. ARE THERE ANY OTHER [inaudible] PUBLIC COMMENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION APPRECIATE EVERYONE HAS BEEN HERE AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LISTENING AT HOME AND IN OTHER PLACES. I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY FURTHER TAX FROM MY HUSBAND SO MAYBE HE WENT OUT AND PLAYED A ROUND OF GOLF HELLO IT'S RAINING -- YOU NEVER KNOW AND I GUESS I COULD FIND OUT IF I KNEW HOW TO USE THIS -- IN MY PHONE A LITTLE BIT BETTER. BUT THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE HIGHLIGHT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE IN THAT WE CAN HAVE A PART IN. MAKING SURE THAT THE FUTURE IS REFLECTIVE OF THE NEEDS IN THE VALUES OF THE PEOPLE WE SERVE SO WITH THAT. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. WERE INJURED
