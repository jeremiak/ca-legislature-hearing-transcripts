EVERYONE WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND CALL THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE TWO ON EDUCATION FINANCE TO WATER THE OUR REACHING FOUR PM AND- NOW THAT THE SENATE IS A GERMAN WE WILL GOING TO BEGIN THIS HEARING. SO GOOD AFTERNOON THIS AFTERNOON WE WILL DISCUSS THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR IN THE AUDIT REPORT RELEASED IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR TITLED CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. IT FAILED TO FULLY DISCLOSE ITS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION SURPLUS AND IT HAS NOT ADEQUATELY INVESTED IN ALTERNATIVES TO COSTLY PARKING FACILITIES. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY WOMAN QUIRK SILVA FOR REQUESTING THE ADDED IT AND FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY. THANK YOU TO ALL THE MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE CHAIRS THAT ARE HERE TODAY AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING AND YOUR ATTENDANCE THIS IS CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT TOPIC FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING THE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND. CSU STUDENTS IN OUR STATE. PROVIDING AN AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY FOR YOUR COLLEGE EDUCATION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE. OUR HEARING TODAY WILL CONSIST OF TWO PANELS OUR FIRST PANEL WILL CONSIST OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE STATE AUDITOR WILL PRESENT THE RESULTS OF THE AUDIT REPORT. THE LA IS MAINLY HERE TO ASSIST WITH ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS MAY HAVE. OUR SECOND PANEL CONSISTS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE CSU SYSTEM A MEMBER OF THE CS USE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CAL STATE. STUDENT ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR ATTENDANCE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE YOUR PERSPECTIE. THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION INCREASING ENROLLMENT OUR FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS ARE ALWAYS TOPICS OF GREAT INTEREST AND CONCERN FOR THE LEGISLATURE. AND FOR EACH OF US PERSONALLY. I AM CERTAINLY HAPPY WITH THE CS USE SYSTEMS COMMITMENT TO INCREASING ENROLLMENT. THIS INCLUDES IN ROLLING A HUNDRED THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STUDENTS BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THIS GROWTH CERTAINLY PRESENTS CHALLENGES INCLUDING FUNDING AND PARKING CHALLENGES REGARDING ENSURING THAT CSU STUDENTS FINANCIAL PARKING NEEDS ARE ACCOMMODATED. THIS REPORT WILL DISCUSS TODAY'S WE WILL DISCUSS TODAY PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DISCUSS THESE CHALLENGES AND WHAT THE CSU IS DOING TO ADDRESS TRANSPORTATION NEEDS AND INSTILL CONFIDENCE IN ITS STUDENTS IN THE LEGISLATURE. THAT FUND THAT FUNDS ARE BEING PROPERLY DISCLOSE AND ACCOUNTED FOR. THE AUDIT REPORT DID NOTE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE APPROPRIATELY SAFEGUARDS YES USE ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE THE CENTRALIZED STATE TREASURY SYSTEM. THE ROCK DOT IT REPORT ALSO FOUND THAT CSU CAMPUSES APPROPRIATELY SPENT PARKING FINES AND DO NOT IMPOSE QUOTAS ON PARKING VIOLATIONS. THE REPORT ALSO FOUND THAT THE CSU APPROPRIATELY DISPERSED EARNINGS FROM PARKING REVIEW INVESTMENTS. NOT A REPORT NONETHELESS FOUND ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN SEVERAL AREAS. THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT THE CSU FELL TO FULLY DISCLOSE ITS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION SURPLUS. FROM FISCAL YEARS TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OH NINE THROUGH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN CSU SURPLUS GREW BY MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT. IT ACCUMULATED A DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS OF MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FROM TUITION DURING THIS TIME FRAME. FROM FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OH NINE THROUGH FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THROUGH TWELVE CSU RAISE THE COST OF TUITION BY ABOUT 80% FROM FISCAL YEARS TWENTY TWELVE TO THIRTEEN THROUGH TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ONE CSU SURPLUS ALMOST DOUBLED ITS GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION GREW BY SIXTY PERCENT. ON COMPARISON THE STATE WIDE RAINY DAY FUND CONSISTS OF A 10% RESERVE WHILE THE CSU FUNDS DISCUSSED TODAY CONSTITUTES A 20% RESERVE. IF WE USE A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR FIGURE SOMETHING I KNOW THE CSU IN THE CHANCELLOR EAGER TO DISCUSS DURING THEIR TESTIMONY. THEY ARE REPORT ALSO FOUND THAT THE CSU AS NOT ADEQUATELY INVESTED IN ALTERNATIVES TO COSTLY PARKING FACILITIES. AT THE FOUR CAMPS IS A STATE AUDITOR REVIEWED. THEY HAD BUILT EXPENSIVE YOU PARKING FACILITIES THAT COMMITTED THEM TO SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM DEBT. RESULTING IN INCREASED PARKING PERMIT FEES FOR STUDENTS SOME AS HIGH AS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX DOLLARS PER SEMESTERWHILE ONLY MINIMALLY INCREASING PARKING CAPACITY. ONE CAMPUS BUILT A PARKING FACILITY NOT INTENDED FOR STUDENTS ALTHOUGH THE CAMPUS YOU STUDENT PERMIT FEES TO PAY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION. SOMETHING SOMETHING I KNOW SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE OF TAKE IN PARTICULAR OFFENSE TO. I KNOW THE CSU IS TAKEN SOME EXCEPTION TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S CHARACTERIZATION OF ITS SURPLUS FUNDS. SO I AM HAPPY TO HAVE BOTH THE STATE AUDITOR AND THE CHANCELLOR HERE TODAY SO THAT THIS ISSUE CAN BE CLARIFIED. TODAY I MEAN WE HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT I NEED ANSWERED. WHY DID THE CSU INCREASED TUITION BY MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT. GIVEN THAT IT WAS RECEIVING A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION THAT GREW BY SIXTY PERCENT. AND THEN INCREASED ITS RESERVES TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS NOW TWICE THE SIZE PERCENTAGE WISE OF THE STATEWIDE RESERVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S BUILT UP IN OUR OWN RAINY DAY FUND. ADDITIONALLY SOME OF THESE FUNDS. COULD HAVE BEEN SPENT ON THE STUDENTS HERE INCREASE TUITIONS DID FEES. CONTRIBUTED TO THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION RESERVE I BELIEVE THE STATE AUDITOR WAS CORRECT WHEN SHE WROTE THAT BY FAILING TO DISCLOSE A SURPLUS WHEN THEY CAN WHEN CONSULTING WITH STUDENTS ABOUT TUITION INCREASES ARE WHEN PROJECTING CSU'S RESOURCES AND NEEDS TO THE LEGISLATURE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS PREVENTED. HAS PROVIDED A LEGISLATORS AND STUDENTS FROM EVALUATING THIS YES USE FINANCIAL NEEDS IN LIGHT OF ITS ON SPENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES ON THE ISSUE OF STUDENT FEES AS AUDITCOMMITTEES LAST HEARING. WE APPROVED OR NOT REQUESTED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURNER HORVATH RELATED TO CSUS CSU STUDENT FEES AT THE HEARING I WAS IMPRESSED BY THE MEMBERS PASSION FOR INSURING AND AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AT THIS YES USE SEVERAL OF US WERE STAND THOUGH TO LEARN HOUSE LARGE STUDENT FEES ARE. HOW MUCH THOSE FEES OF GROWN AT C. ISSUES CAMPUSES AND HOW INCONSISTENT. THOSE FEES WERE ACROSS THE TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES. WE ALL CARE GREATLY ABOUT ENSURING THAT THEIR INTERESTS ARE BEING ADEQUATELY TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN DECISIONS ARE MADE. THAT IMPACT THEM MAP YOU SEE THE MEMBERS HERE TODAY I'M SURE THAT WE WILL EQUALLY FOCUS ON CSU STUDENTS BEST INTEREST. AT TODAY. LOOK FORWARD TO A PRODUCTIVE AND ROBUST DISCUSSION. I LIKE TO WELCOME EACH OF THE CHAIRS OF THE DIFFERENT COMMITTEES AND AT THIS TIME. WOULD INVITE SOME OF THEM FOR OPENING COMMENTS WE WILL START WITH OUR ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION MANY. HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. THANK YOU SO REMEMBER SALAS. I BELIEVE THIS HEARING IS TIMELY AS I REVIEWED THE FINDINGS I FOUND THAT MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE AUDIT FINDINGS TO BE SOMEWHAT MISLEADING. CSU SURPLUS WAS NOT A SECRET. C. S. YOU DISCLOSE THE FIGURES TO A FEW. HOWEVER I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT MOVING FORWARD CS YOU MUST DO BETTER IN ITS TRANSPARENCY. I FIND IT INTERESTING THE DURING THE WORST PERIOD OF THE RECENT ECONOMIC CRISIS WELL CSU STUDENTS WERE BEING. TUITION WAS BEING REYES ASTRONOMIC LIKELY THE C. S. YOU BUDGET SURPLUS GREW. DURING THIS HEARING I HOPE TO HEAR FROM SHE AS YOU AS TO WHY AT THE MOST CRITICAL TIME OF NEEDING TO ASSIST OUR STUDENTS INSTEAD OF DIPPING AND TO THE SURPLUS THE DECISION WAS MADE TO RAISE TUITION. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING HOUSE CSU VIEWS THE ROLE OF TUITION. AND HOW THEY DEFINED TRANSPARENCY. I LOOK FORWARD TO AN INFORMATIVE THOUGHT PROVOKING ROBUST SOLUTION ORIENTED DISCUSSION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER SALAS. THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA AT THIS TIME I WALK ADDITIONAL OPENING COMMENTS. AND WE WILL HAVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER AUDIT CHAIR NO THIS IS A JOINT HEARING WITH THE HIRING COMMITTEE AND THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AS WELL BECAUSE ALL THE ISSUES WE DISCUSS THE BUDGET RELATE TO FUNDING ARE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND THEY ALL BOIL DOWN TO. NOT ENOUGH MONIES FOR ALL THE NEEDS FOR OUR OUR COLLEGE SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO HE WAS ALREADY KINDA LAID OUT THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING I JUST REALLY HAVE A COUPLE QUICK. MAIN ISSUE THAT I WANT TO GET OUT OF IT TODAY SO I WANT TO PUT THIS OUT THERE FOR THE CSU AND THE AUDIT TEAM HELP ME UNDERSTAND IT'S REALLY THE WHAT AND THE WHY THE WHAT IS THE REASON FOR THIS. RESERVE ACCOUNTS THE AMOUNT THAT IT'S THEIR HOUSES RELATE TO OTHER STATE AGENCIES IN THE RESERVE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE. AS FAR AS DISCLOSURE PURPOSES WELL I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT I DON'T THINK IT WAS AS MISTER MEDINA'S STATED THAT IT WAS ALWAYS KNOWN MAYBE IT WAS BURIED IN SON TABLE THAT NOBODY SAW BUT AS THAT PERSON DEALING WITH THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET FOR CSU. I NEVER REMEMBER HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS I'VE OVERSEEN THE CSU BUDGET AND I'VE SPOKEN TO OUR BUDGET YEAR AS WELL THIS WENT OVER TING WE HAVE THE SAME CONCLUSION HERE. SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE THAT THERE WAS NOT IN THERE IS NOT PROPER DISCLOSURE BUT THE BIG PICTURE I THINK THE THAT THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR PICTURE IS THAT WE DO HAVE THIS RESERVE FUND AND THE LOGIC OF THIS IS THAT SUPPOSED TO HELP US WHEN TIMES ARE BAD. IT'S SUPPOSED TO HELP STUDENTS WHEN TIMES ARE TOUGH. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT DURING THE LAST. GET IN THE ECONOMY WHEN TIMES WERE TOUGH WE DIDN'T GET INTO THIS RESERVE TO HELP OUR STUDENTS. WE ACTUALLY INCREASE THE ACCOUNT. AND OTHER WORDS OF A FAMILY SAVES. MONEY FOR A RAINY DAY AND THEY LOSE THEIR THEIR JOB YOU WOULD THINK THAT RAINY DAY FUND. IS TO HELP THE FAMILY NOT TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE THAT RESERVE ACCOUNT SO I THINK THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT WE NEED. TO ADDRESS. IN OTHER WORDS WHY DO YOU HAVE THIS RESERVE ACCOUNT IN THE FIRST PLACE IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE IT. DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN SO LOOK FOR DISCUSSIONS COMING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE SOMEWHERE IN A MOVE TO COMMENTS FROM ASSEMBLY WOMAN QUIRK SILVA WHO ORIGINALLY REQUESTED THE ON IT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE YES I WAS WITH THE MEMBER THAT DID REQUEST THIS AND I DO THINK OF THE EMPLOYEES UP FROM CSU THAT TO MET WITH ME AND THIS WAS DISCUSSED ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND I THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE FOR AND THE- TEAM THAT DID THE- AUDIT. I WANT TO FIRST TALK AS A AS A GRADUATE OF CSU WHICH IS I THINK MANY OF US HERE HAVE. ATTENDED BUT I IT DID RECEIVE MY TEACHING CREDENTIAL AT CSU AND I HAVE TWO SONS ONE SON THAT GRADUATED FROM CAL STATE FULLERTON LAST YEAR AND HAD IT EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE THERE AND ANOTHER SON THAT WILL BE STARTING CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ. IN A FEW WEEKS SO I AM A HUGE SUPPORTER OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE UC'S NRCS USE I'M ALSO A PARENT OR FOR MILLENNIALS SO I'VE SPENT THE LAST DAY DECADE NOT ONLY UP WORKING TO HELP THEM. GET THROUGH COLLEGE BUT ALSO SUPPORTING THAT FINANCIALLY AND AS A PARENT SOMETIMES WE DO OUR ANNUAL BUDGETS TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH COLLEGE IS GOING TO COST AND- THAT IS WHERE SOME OF MY INTEREST STARTED TO COME IN BUDGET NOT NOTICING THE STUDENT FEES THAT WERE ADDED ON PARKING FEES. AND I ALSO HAPPEN TO LOOK LIVE A BLOCK AWAY FROM FULLERTON COLLEGE SOME VERY MUCH IMMERSED IN AND FULLER TAKING COLLAGEN CSU AND- EVERYTHING FROM PARKING. AS WE HAVE MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. NOT USING THE PARKING. A PARKING STRUCTURES AS THEY ARE VERY COSTLY AND SO THIS ALL KIND OF HITS HOME AND FULLER TEN IS CONSIDERED THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY HAVING FULLERTON COLLEGE CSU THE OPTOMETRY SCHOOL OTHER HOPE UNIVERSITY SO THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS COMING INTO FULLER TEN. SO I VERY MUCH HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN THIS ISSUE ON AND ALSO BEING A THIRTY YEAR EDUCATOR BUT ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS I WAS UPSET TO LEARN THAT THE CS USE. HAD ACCUMULATED A SURPLUS OF MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WHICH CONSISTED OF UNSPENT TUITION AND PARKING REVENUE. DURING THE SAME TIME THAT THE SURPLUS WAS GROWING THE ANNUAL TUITION FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING THE CSU CAMPUSES SUCH AS FULLER TO NEARLY DOUBLED AND THE INCREASED MORE FOR. FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE CS USE. ALTHOUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CONSIDERS THE SURPLUS TO BE CRITICAL FOR SUPPORTING CSU'S OPERATIONAL NEEDS THEY DID NOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THESE NEEDED FUNDS WHILE RAISING TUITION COSTS. THROUGHOUT THIS TIME STUDENTS AND PARENTS HAVE HAD TO SHOULDER HUGE IN TUITION INCREASES WHEN THE CAMPUSES HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE EDUCATION MORE AFFORDABLE THEY FAILED TO DO SO. IN THE MEANTIME I CAN STITCHES MY CONSTITUENTS ATTENDING CAL STATE FULLERTON ARE BURDENED WITH THE MOST EXPENSIVE PARKING PERMIT COSTS OF ALL OUR CAMPUSES OR CSU LEADERSHIP COULD HAVE HELPED OUR STUDENTS BY REDUCING THE COST. BUT ONCE AGAIN THEY FAILED TO DO SO THIS AUDIT PAINTS A PICTURE OF DISREGARD FOR STUDENTS. AND PARENTS ALL WELL THE FAILING TO USE THESE FUNDS FOR THE GOOD OF STUDENTS. MEMBERS IT'S TIME TO REIN IN THE MINDSET THAT YOU STUDENT FUNDS WHAT THREE WITHOUT REGARD TO STUDENTS NEEDS I AM DISAPPOINTED NOT ONLY WITH THE RESPECT TO WHAT WAS DISCOVERED BUT WHAT THE RESPONSE THAT SEEKS TO MAKE EXCUSES RATHER THAN ACCEPTING THE REVIEW AS CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR REMARKS. THANK YOU SIMONE QUIRK SILVA. LET'S MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER WHO IS CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CAMPUS CLIMATE TO MAKE OPENING COMMENTS RIGHT AND IT NOT AND ACTUALLY INTENDED TO BUT I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AB THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS WERE HERE TODAY FOR THE CALLING THIS MEETING AND SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT DIED HAVE OF. ONE ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF A BILL THAT IS CONSISTENTLY TWO OF THEM ONE DEALING WITH STUDENT PARKING OTHER IN DEALING WITH THE ISSUES OF MERIT PAY FOR US STAFF AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE PEOPLE WHO WORK BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT I WAS AT THE C. ISSUE DURING THIS TIME FRAME AND I REMEMBER. MEETINGS AND WE ATTENDED IN TERMS OF HOW WE WERE GOING TO CUT THINGS AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO AND PROBABLY THE MOST EGREGIOUS THING THAT I THINK HAPPENED IN THIS TIME FRAME THAT WE IF REQUIRED. ALL THE FACULTY SEE ISSUE TO TAKE A 10% PAY CUT. AND WE TOOK A PAY CUT AT THE TIME WITH THE FOLKS OBVIOUSLY WE'RE- MAKING LEADING. SCORER IN THIS MONEY AWAY IN KEEPING IT. AND I REMEMBER QUITE WELL HOW I. HOW BADLY I FELT FOR MOST OF MY STAFF. PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO A CLERICAL WORKERS AND WHO WERE. ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANTS WHO WERE TAKING 10% CUTS IN THEIR SALARY. AND THIS WAS A SIGNIFICANT CUT. WE ALSO LOST ME FACULTY MEMBERS WHO COULDN'T AFFORD TO TAKE THE CUT. AND WE WORK CONSTANTLY BEING INFORMED THAT THIS WAS THE CENTRAL FOR US TO DO TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM. TO KEEP OUR C. ISSUE ALIVE. AND THE FACULTY AND STAFF DID THAT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WOULD INVESTING IN. CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE FOR ITS INSTITUTION. AND AS I REFLECT BACK AS A FACULTY MEMBER WHO WHO LOST 10% CUT. WE ALL WERE MADE TO TAKE FOR LEVELS. AND IT WASN'T AS DIFFICULT FOR ME AS IT WAS FOR THE MY CLERICAL STAFF TO WORK FOR ME FOLKS WERE MAKING PROBABLY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND WOOD AND LOSING. 10% OF THAT SALARY. THEY HAD DIFFICULTY MAKING THEIR RENT THEY HAD DIFFICULTY DOING THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE CENTRAL. AND AS I LOOK AT THIS REPORT AND I HAD TO REFLECT BACK ON THAT TIME FRAME. IT IS REALLY. SHAMEFUL THAT WILL ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. AT A TIME WHEN WE WERE DOING OTHER THINGS IN TERMS OF INCREASING FEES IN PEOPLE BELIEVING. THAT THEY WERE CONTRIBUTING TO THE- THE LIFE AND GROWTH OF OUR INSTITUTION THAT IT WAS A SACRIFICE THEY MADE BECAUSE THEY LOVE TO SEE ISSUE. BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE INSTITUTIONS OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO WHEN I LOOK BACK ON THIS IT. IT MAKES ME VERY SAD. TO BELIEVE THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS THAT NOT CARE AS MUCH ABOUT OUR STAFF AND OUR FACULTY AS THE CURE ABOUT THE INSTITUTION. AND THIS IS A SHAMEFUL MOMENT I THINK IN CALIFORNIA OF MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES OF COUNSEL HE SAID THERE'S A ONE POINT SOMEBODY BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS AND MOST OF US THAT. ONCE AGAIN ANOTHER CONSPIRACY THEORY AND WE DIDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IT AS WE SHOULD HAVE AND AS WE BEGIN TO LOOK AT IT THEY WERE BECAUSE THEY WERE RIGHT. THEY HAD BEEN FOLLOWING IT AND THEY KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND MORE THAN ANYTHING I REGRET. OF WHAT WE'VE DONE. ANDI LIKE I SAID IN OUR ATTENDED MEETINGS AFTER MEETINGS AS ITS CHAIR OF A DEPARTMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY THING THAT WE COULD DO. TO SAVE THE SEA ISSUE. AND OBVIOUSLY WAS NOT. THANK YOU WILL MOVE TO CENTER MORE LIKE AND THEN WE WILL MOVE INTO OUR FIRST PASS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST A TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY RECENTLY RELEASED THEIR- ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND- THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD NOW REQUIRES THE INCLUSION. OF OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. ALSO KNOWN AS RETIREE MEDICAL AND THEY HAD TO ADD TO THEIR- BALANCE SHEET A LIABILITY OF THIRTEEN POINT FOUR NINE TO THIRTEEN BILLION FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO MILLION MORE ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET THEIR UNRESTRICTED NET POSITION WAS PRETTY HEALTHY. COMPARED TO OTHER DISTRICTS BUT IT WAS UPSIDE DOWN THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION LAST YEAR NOW IT'S UPSIDE DOWN BY SEVENTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION. SO MAYBE. TO HAVE SOME BALANCE HAVING ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. ON HAND IS PROBABLY A GOOD THING RIGHT NOW WITH THE NUMBERS THAT ARE BEING REFLECTED IN THEIR PUBLISHED FINANCIAL REPORTS IN MISTER CHURCHES SOMETHING MAYBE WE NEED TO LOOK AT FOR ALL OF OUR- MUNICIPALITIES THAT ARE NOW REQUIRED. TO REPORT THE UN RESTRICTED OR COMMITTEE ON FUNDED ACTUARIAL ACCRUED LIABILITY FOR RETIREE MEDICAL THESE NUMBERS ARE ARE RATHER STAGGERING FOR LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ALONE HAD AT FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AND SO WE MAY FIND THESE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AT OUR DOORSTEP SOON LOOKING FOR SOME WAY TO PAY FOR THESE. LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOW FINALLY BEING RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET SO. I JUST WANT TO LOOK AT IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AS WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN THIS HEARING IN THIS TOPIC. WITH THIS YES USE I THINK THAT'S A VERY. PREVALENT WITH THE AMOUNT OF CHAIRS IN THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST FROM ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND- THE- AMOUNT OF PARTICIPATION FROM THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD AND CALL UP THE FIRST PANEL. WHICH IS THE OVERVIEW OF THE AUDIT REPORT AND INFORMATION ON CALIFORNIA'S. STATE UNIVERSITY WE HAVE MISS ELAINE HOW OUR STATE AUDITOR FROM CALVERT STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. WE HAVE MISTER NICHOLAS COLOR CALYPSO'S. I TO PRINCE WILL KILL FOR STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE PAUL'S STAND HOUSING PRINCIPAL ANALYST WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. ABBAS HOW WHEN YOU ARE READY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CHAIR MEDINA CHAIR MCCARTY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES FOR THE RECORD MY NAME THE LINE HOW ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR TO MY LEFT IS NIKOLAY TELLS A MYSTICALLY TO US WAS THE AUDIT PRINCIPLE ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA INDICATED THIS WAS AN AUDIT THAT WAS REQUESTED BY HER THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE ASKING US TO LOOK AT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS ONE WAS LOOKING AT THE PARKING ISSUES AT FOR VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT THE USE OF OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS WHICH A LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED THIS YES YOU DO. A FEW YEARS AGO SEVERAL YEARS AGO BUT THEN EXPANDED IT A FEW YEARS AGO. SO WE LOOKED AT THOSE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES. I'M GOING TO VERY BRIEFLY GO OVER. THE KEY FINDINGS KEY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE IN THE AUDIT REPORT. MYSTICALLY TELL US IS GONNA STEP YOU THROUGH A HAND OUT THAT THE SERGEANTS I BELIEVE HAVE HAVE DISTRIBUTED TO THE VARIOUS MEMBERS. THOSE HANDOUTS HOPEFULLY WILL L. ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I'M GOING TO PRESENT. TO THE TO YOU MEMBERS OF THE VARIOUS COMMITTEES. AS WELL AS WE CONCLUDED IN THE REPORT WE BELIEVE THAT'S THE ISSUE FAILED TO FULLY DISCLOSE THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. NOW MR MEDINA I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS SOME DISCLOSURE AND WE WILL EXPLAIN THAT THERE WAS SOME DISCLOSURE. OF A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS. BUT THAT SURPLUS IS AS WE DO IN THEIR AUDIT REPORT IS SPLIT BETWEEN SPINES THAT ARE CLEARLY RESTRICTED FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES SO IF THEY COLLECT FEES FOR STUDENT DEVELOPMENT CENTER STUDENT HOUSING. THOSE FUNDS ARE RESTRICTED SO WE HAVE A FIGURE IN THE REPORT THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE IS TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS SPECIFICALLY RESTRICTED BY. THE COLLECTION OF THOSE PARTICULAR FUNDS BUT THE OTHER HALF OF THE EQUATION THE OTHER TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IS MONEY THAT WE LOOKED AT AND THE CSU HAS ESSENTIALLY BROKEN THAT TWO BILLION DOLLARS DOWN INTO SOME RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. BUT THEN THAT LEAVES US WITH A LITTLE OVER ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE DESCRIBE AS DISCRETIONARY THEY TAKE ISSUE WITH THAT. WE BELIEVE IT'S DISCRETIONARY. ESSENTIALLY BASED ON THE FACT THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE IN VARIOUS ACCOUNTS FOR VARIOUS OF THE TWENTY THREE INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA THE PRESIDENTS OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS CAN REACH INTO THOSE FUNDS AND USE THOSE FUNDS FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PURPOSES THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY. AND THE USE OF THAT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND THEN THERE'S OF COURSE THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION THEY'VE SET ASIDE FOR RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. AS AS A CHAIRMAN INDICATED WE LOOKED AT A TEN YEAR WINDOW MEMBERS ASKED US TO COVER THAT TIME FRAME SO OVER THAT TIME FRAME AS. CALIFORNIA DID FROM SOME MONEY THAT CAME INTO CALIFORNIA UNDER THE RECOVERY ACT UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SOME MONEY CAME INTO CALIFORNIA SOME OF THAT MONEY WENT TO HIGHER EDUCATION. BUT ALL THE WHILE. THE SURPLUS AS WE CALL IT CONTINUE TO GROW FROM TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT ALL THE WAY THROUGH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THERE IS AN ARE ARE MINE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF DISCRETIONARY MONEY. THAT THE C. ISSUE ARE COULD BE USING TEATHER OFFSET TUITION INCREASES OR TO USE FOR WHATEVER PURPOSES THEY SEE FIT. AT THE SAME TIME THIS WOULD THIS. SURPLUS WAS INCREASING THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION IN CALIFORNIA THE MEMBERS A LEGISLATURE CALIFORNIA IS DOING BETTER THAT WAS RECOVERING SO THAT APPROPRIATION REALLY BASICALLY. RECOVERED AND IT INCREASED ABOUT 60% OVER THE OLD THAT SAME TIME FRAME SO THE CSU WAS RECEIVING ADDITIONAL INCREASES IN APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY THE ADMINISTRATION'S AT THAT TIME BUT AT THE SAME TIME THIS SURPLUS. CONTINUE TO GROW AS I SAID OVER THAT TEN YEAR WINDOW 4100% OUR ISSUE WITH DISCLOSURE AND THE GRAPHIC THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT MR CLEATS US WILL STEP YOU THROUGH REALLY DOES EXPLAIN OTHER CONCERNS WE HAVE THERE A COUPLE OF REPORTS THAT WE REALLY ARE GOING TO HIGHLIGHT ONE. CRITICAL REPORT IS CALLED THE WORKING FAMILIES TRANSPARENCY ACT REQUIRE CS YOU TO CONSULT WITH STUDENTS IS THE STUDENT ASSOCIATION IN THE EVENT THERE CONSIDERING A TUITION INCREASE. AND THERE ARE VARIOUS REAP REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE TO BE INCLUDED IN THAT CONSULTATION. AND ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS IS. DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE ANY ALTERNATIVES TO INCREASING TUITION. SO WHEN CSU APPROACH TO STUDENT ASSOCIATION THEY GAVE THEM A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT DIFFERENT OPTIONS WE HOPEFULLY CAN GET MORE MONEY FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE GONNA HAVE IF WE DON'T WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RAISE TUITION IF WE DON'T DO GET EITHER OF THOSE WE WILL HAVE TO CUT PROGRAMS WHAT THEY DID NOT DISCLOSE IN THAT REPORT OR TO THE STUDENT ASSOCIATION IS. THEY HAD ONE POINT FOUR BILLION AT THAT TIME IN THIS AND OUR WORDS A DISCRETIONARY ACCOUNT IN THIS INVESTMENT ACCOUNT THAT WAS AVAILABLE FOR USE SO THEY SHOULD HAVE IN OUR MINDS SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH THE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. SO THEN THERE COULD HAVE BEEN THE CONVERSATION WE NEED TO KEEP THAT MONEY IN RESERVE BECAUSE WE'RE SETTING IT ASIDE FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS WERE SITTING INSIDE FOR EMERGENCIES IT CETERA BUT THE DISCUSSION NEVER TOOK PLACE AND THAT'S BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION WAS NOT DISCLOSED TO THE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. ANOTHER KEY REPORT THAT THE CSU IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TO THE LEGISLATURE. IS THE ACADEMIC SUSTAINABILITY PLAN AND THIS IS A PLAN THAT WAS IN THE BUDGET ACT REQUIRED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHERE CSU IS SUPPOSED TO. PROVIDE TO THE LEGISLATURE ANY AND ALL RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO PAY THEIR EXPENSES AGAIN THIS IS ANOTHER. REPORT THAT WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE DISCLOSURE OF THE FOUR BILLION AND THEN POTENTIALLY BREAKING THAT FOUR BILLION OUT TO SEEK TO EXPLAIN. SOME OF THAT IS DEFINITELY RESTRICTED MONEY WE CANNOT USE IT FOR ANY. PARTICULAR EIGHT WE HAVE TO USE IT FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE BUT HERE'S A POT OF MONEY WHERE WE HAVE. A MORE FLEXIBILITY SO WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO HAVE SEEN THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION AND INCLUSION IN THE IN THE REPORT THAT CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE. THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES THAT WE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO SHARING WITH BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY WITH THE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. NOW WE ARE NOT AS A STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE GOING TO ARGUE THAT HAVING A RESERVE ISN'T A PRUDENT THING TO DO ABSOLUTELY IT'S A PRUDENT THING TO DO. BUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE CS USE RESERVE POLICY WE DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF THE PARAMETERS OR THE INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN A RESERVE POLICY. AND WILL STEP YOU THROUGH ANOTHER ELEMENT IN THE GRAPHICS THAT WE HANDED OUT THAT COMPARES SEE ISSUES POLICY TO WHAT. THE LEGISLATURE ARE PUT TOGETHER WHEN WE CREATED THE RAINY DAY FUND AND A RESERVE ESSENTIALLY FOR ECONOMIC ACT. UNCERTAINTY AS FAR AS PARAMETERS. RESERVE POLICY SHOULD ESTABLISH WHAT'S THE MINIMUM RESERVE WE WANT TO ESTABLISH WHAT'S THE MAXIMUM RESERVE. IS THEY'RE REPORTING ON IF WE DEPEND TO THE RESERVE WHAT ARE WE USING THOSE FUNDS FOR. WHAT'S THE AUTHORITY WHO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DIP INTO THE RESERVE AND ULTIMATELY WHO DECIDES HOW THAT MONEY SHOULD BE USED AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE SO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT WE WOULD EXPECTEDTO SEE IN A RESERVE POLICY THAT WE DID NOT SEE. IN THE POLICY THAT SEE ISSUE CURRENTLY HAS SO WE THINK THERE ARE AREAS THAT THIS ISSUE CERTAINLY COULD COULD STRENGTHEN WITH RESPECT TO THEIR RESERVE POLICY ANOTHER POINT IS THE RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF. THAT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. THERE IS NO PARAMETER AROUND THE RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY THERE'S NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. AND THE OTHER ONE POINT ONE I MEAN BILLION DOLLARS THAT THAT IS INCLUDED THAT COMES TOGETHER FOR THE ONE POINT FIVE SO YOU'VE GOT ONE POINT FIVE SURPLUS. THEY WILL SUGGEST TO YOU FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IS RESERVE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY THAT LEAVES YOU ONE POINT ONE BILLION. BUT THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO AMOUNTS WHEN WE LOOKED AT POLICIES PROCEDURES HOW ARE YOU GOING TO USE ECONOMIC THE FUNDS FOR A RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. THERE IS NO DISTINCTION AND THERE NEEDS TO BE CLARIFICATION IN THE EVENT THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. AND THEN HAVE YOU ADDITIONAL SURPLUS FUNDS A FURTHER THAT THEY THEY'RE SETTING ASIDE FOR OTHER PURPOSES SO THEY REALLY NEED TO STRENGTHEN SOME OF THEIR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES SURROUNDING THAT. THE OTHER ISSUE WE IDENTIFIED AS THERE WAS NOT. A LOT OF REPORTING BACK TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE STATE REQUIRES IS AN ANNUAL REPORT WITH RESPECT TO THE AMOUNT IN RESERVES IN THE RAINY DAY FUND AND RESERVES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE C. ISSUE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE REPORT TO THE TRUSTEES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS HOW MUCH MONEY IS IN RESERVE. HOW MUCH MONEY IS IN SURPLUS AND WHAT THEY'RE SETTING ASIDE NOW WE DID GIVE THE CSU CREDIT. THERE WAS A MEETING A BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WHERE THE RESERVES WERE DISCUSSED. AND THEY LAID OUT SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF THEIR EXISTING POLICY AND WHAT THEIR GOALS WERE MOVING FORWARD SO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THAT THAT IS SUBSEQUENT TO THE DECISION. FOR THE TUITION INCREASED WAS VOTED ON BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AT THE MARCH TWENTY SEVENTEEN MEETING. THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION THAT I SAW WHEN I WATCH THE BOARD EETING. ABOUT ANY KIND OF RESERVES ARE ANY SURPLUS AVAILABLE TO OFFSET. NOW AT THE JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN BOARD OF TRUSTEES THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION. BECAUSE THERE WERE QUESTIONS FROM THE TRUSTEES. IF WE DON'T GET THE AMOUNT OF APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE NEED WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO. THE RESPONSE WAS WE CAN DEPEND TO SOME. SOME FUNDS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE TYPICALLY USE FOR NON RECURRING. EXPENSES SO THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A- DISCUSSION NOT REALLY SUGGESTING THAT WE HAVE ONE OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. IN THAT ACCOUNT. SO WE COULD JUST TAP INTO THAT. COM BUT THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION BUT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A REGULAR ROUTINE. CONVERSATION WITH THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ABOUT THE RESERVE THE RESERVE POLICY AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT. THE CSU CURRENTLY HAS IN THAT PARTICULAR RESERVE. SO WE HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS AND I'M GOING HIGH LEVEL WE CERTAINLY WILL WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO ANSWER ANY PARTICULAR QUESTIONS I WANT TO ALLOW TIME FOR MR COOLEY TELLS TO STEP YOU THROUGH. OTHER GRAPHICS THAT WE HANDED OUT SO REALLY THE RECOMMENDATIONS FLOW WITH FROM THE FINDINGS I JUST DISCUSSED THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE TRANSPARENCY THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO RELEVANT PARTIES THE LEGISLATURE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND REALLY DISTINGUISH THE VARIOUS BALANCES IN THOSE DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS AND CERTAINLY THE DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS THAT THAT THE CSU IS ACCUMULATED AN IMPORTANT POINT IS MUCH OF THE IS THIS DISCRETIONARY MONEY IS TUITION MONEY AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE WHEN IT ALLOWED. LEGISLATION TO ALLOW THIS YEAR'S YOU TO INVEST IN OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS. THEY SAID YOU'RE NOT USING GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION TO INVEST YOU'RE GOING TO USE THAT TO PAY FOR EXPENSES OF THE SEA ISSUE SO ANY FUNDING THAT'S LEFT OVER. TYPICALLY IS COMING FROM TUITION SO MOST OF THE MONEY IN THAT SURPLUS DISCRETIONARY ACCOUNT. WAS GENERATED BY TUITION. NOW KEEP THAT IN MIND THE TUITION INCREASE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN GENERATED SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. THE RESERVE AMOUNT THAT DISCRETIONARY AMOUNT INCREASED ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM STE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WHEN AT THE SAME TIME THEY RAISE TUITION AND- FOR STUDENTS AND GENERATED ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS JUST TO PUT THAT IN A LITTLE BIT OF PERSPECTIVE SO WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IN ALL OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS IS. MORE TRANSPARENCY MORE DISCLOSURE MORE DISCUSSION ANNUAL REPORTING TO THE BORDER REGION I MEAN THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES MAKING SURE THAT. THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT BALANCE IN THOSE IN THOSE OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS ON A PARTICULARLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OPERATING EXPENSES THE DISCRETIONARY AMOUNTS AS REALLY DISTINGUISHABLE SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH MONEY IS THERE SO THAT THE CONVERSATION CAN HAPPEN WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY SUGGESTING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DIP INTO YOUR RESERVE TO KEEP YOUR OPERATIONS GOING YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE. BUT YOU NEED TO DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION SO YOU CAN HAVE THE CONVERSATION THE LEGISLATURE CAN BE FULLY INFORMED THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES CAN BE FULLY INFORMED BEFORE MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS ABOUT PROCREATION AMOUNTS DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO INCREASE TUITION. WE ALSO MADE SIMILAR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THAT THE PUBLISHED IN IT THIS INFORMATION ON ITS WEBSITE WE TALK IN THE REPORT AND THEY WILL AND I ALL LIKELIHOOD MENTION THE PORTAL THAT THEY RECENTLY LAUNCHED. IN MAY OF THIS YEAR SHORTLY AFTER WE SHOULD OUR AUDIT REPORTER SHORTLY BEFORE IN AND IT'S HELPFUL WE DO SAY IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T HAVE SPECIFIC ENOUGH INFORMATION IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ABSOLUTELY. BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE SPECIFICITY ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THE VARIOUS REVENUE REVENUE THAT'S GENERATED THE SOURCE OF THE ACTUAL SURPLUS WHAT IS FEEDING INTO THAT SURPLUS. REPORTING ANNUALLY TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ENSURING THE INFORMATION IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE ON THE WEBSITE TOOK JUST A LOT ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND BEING VERY VERY SPECIFIC. SO THAT'S KIND OF A HIGH LEVEL DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUES WE HAD WITH RESPECT TO THE SURPLUS THAT WE BELIEVE THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION THAT THEY DID NOT FULLY DISCLOSE. OUGHT TO STAKEHOLDERS THE LEGISLATURE AND STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE AUDIT THAT THAT IS QUIRK SILVA ASKED US TO LOOK AT WAS PARKING AND WHETHER OR NOT THE CSU SYSTEM WAS REALLY DOING A GOOD JOB OF NOT ONLY PLANNING FOR PARKING FACILITIES. BUT CONSIDERING ALTERNATE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION OTHER OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR RESPECTIVE CAMPUSES AND WE FOUND THAT WE VISITED FOUR DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES CHANNEL ISLANDS FULLERTON SACRAMENTO AND SAN DIEGO AND WE REALLY FOUND THAT. BASICALLY A LOT OF THE UNIVERSITIES WERE JUST. ESSENTIALLY DECIDING THEY NEEDED TO BUILD FACILITIES AND THEY WEREN'T REALLY DOING THEIR DUE DILIGENCE AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR OTHER OPTIONS. AND INCLUDING IN THEIR PLANS HERE THE ALTERNATIVES THAT WE CONSIDERED HERE THE THINGS THAT WE ARE OR TRYING TO IMPLEMENT. THOSE IN CONJUNCTION WE STILL NEED TO BUILD FACILITIES. WE WEREN'T SEEING ROBUST ANALYSIS WITH RESPECT TO THAT WE ALSO SAW THAT SOME OF THE FACILITY SOME OF THE CAMPUSES CHOSE TO BUILD FACILITIES. THAT RESULTED IN STUDENTS PAYING HIGHER PERMIT FEES AND AS AS MR SALAS MENTIONED THAT SAN DIEGO STATE THE STUDENTS ARE PAYING. HIGHER PERMIT FEES FOR FACILITY THAT WAS CONSTRUCTED THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THAT NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO USE. IT'S A FACILITY THAT WE WAS BUILT FOR OTHER PURPOSES SINCE STUDENTS CAN'T EVEN USE IT YET THEIR FEES WENT UP TO PAY FOR IT. SO THAT WAS A CONCERN THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT. AGAIN THE FEES HAVE GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY ABOUT 60% AT A COUPLE CAMPUSES. THE CAPACITY HAS INCREASED BUT ENROLLMENT HAS OUTPACED THAT SO REALLY THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM NEEDS TO TAKE A HARDER LOOK AT SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS. THERE ARE SOME CAMPUSES THAT WE THINK ARE DOING A PARTICULARLY GOOD JOB SACRAMENTO STATE HERE AND IN SACRAMENTO. REALLY HAS DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS. THEY COLLECT DATA WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THEIR PARKING FACILITIES THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF ANALYZING SOME OF THAT DATA. BUT WE THINK THEY THEY HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB THAN SOME OF THE OTHER CAMPUSES THAT WE VISITED. A COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES AND I'LL I'LL GO TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS REAL QUICK AND THEN I'LL HAVE MYSTICALLY SO STEP YOU THROUGH THE GRAPHICS. IS THE THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT EACH OF THE CAMPUS HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. AND THAT COMMITTEE SHOULD INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF STUDENTS FACULTY STAFF FROM THE UNIVERSITY. OF THE RESPECTIVE UNIVERSITY WE DIDN'T SEE THAT AT EVERY SINGLE INSTITUTION WE ALSO DIDN'T SEE THERE WASN'T A LOT OF GUIDANCE AS TO. THE MAKE UP OF THE COMMITTEE HOW OFTEN THE COMMITTEE SHOULD MEET. WE FOUND THAT SOME CAMPUSES THERE THE COMMITTEES WERE NOT MEETING REGULARLY SO THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF REALLY FOCUSING ON SOME OF THE OPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO. TRYING TO IDENTIFY ALL ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION MODES ALTERNATIVE WAYS FOR STUDENTS TO GET THE CAMPUS. ONE DIFFICULTY THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE IN THE REPORT IS THE REVENUE STREAM. FOR ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS THEY ARE SOMEWHAT LIMITED THEY CAN USE PARKING FINES. SO YOUR STUDENTS COME THE CAMPUS THEY PARK AND THEY GET. A TICKET THEY'RE FINE FOR BEING PARKING IN THEIR PRO INAPPROPRIATE SPACE. THAT'S THE MONEY THAT THE CAMPUS IS AT THIS POINT ARE ABLE TO USE. TO FIND SOME OF THOSE ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS TO THE EXTENT THEY HAVE ANY PARKING REVENUE. A LEFT OVER FROM PAYING FOR MAINTENANCE AND THEIR FACILITIES THEIR THEIR DEBT BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES ARE TAKEN OUT OF BOND. NOT TO PAY FOR THE FACILITY IF THERE IS SOME SURPLUS REVENUE THEY CAN USE SOME OF THAT FOR THE ALTERNATIVE. TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS AND SOME OF THE CAMPS IS DO YOU HAVE A SURPLUS IN THOSE. SO THEY COULD USE SOME OF THAT MONEY BUT IT'S NOT HUGE IT'S NOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY. OUGHT TO PUT TOWARDS. THESE ALTER OUR TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. SO QUICKLY SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THIS IS JUST REALLY DEVELOPING MORE ROBUST TRANSPORTATION PLANS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE MAKING SURE THAT. THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE CONSIDERING BUILDING NEW PARKING FACILITIES HAVE LOOKED AT ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS THEY'VE TRIED TO IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS WOULD BE WHAT WHAT IMPACT WOULD THAT HAVE ON THE CAMPUS HOW MUCH WOULD THAT HELP. IS THERE STILL IN NEED TO BUILD THE PARKING FACILITY SO WE HAVE ALL A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND THAT AS FAR AS COLLECTING DATA WHICH AS I SAID SOME CAMPUSES DO. BUT THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF ANALYZING THE DATA BEFORE THEY TAKE THE NEXT STEP. IN MAKING A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED TO BUILD A FACILITY AND HOW HELPFUL WOULD THAT BE. SO I'M NOT GOING TO BELABOR GOING INTO ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS I CERTAINLY CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS MAY HAVE I'M GOING TO HAND IT OVER TO MISTER KHALID CELLS. HE IS GOING TO STEP YOU THROUGH ON THAT JUST A THREE PAGE. GRAPHICS AND THAT WE HAVE THAT HOPEFULLY WILL WILL ILLUSTRATE. IN A LITTLE BIT BETTER FORM. OUR CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO DISCLOSURE AND THEN CERTAINLY OUR CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO THE RESERVE POLICIES THAT CSU CURRENTLY HAS. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SIR CHAIR PLEASE COMMITTEE CHAIRS. I'M THE CLETUS WITH THE I'M SOURS OFFICE. WHAT I WANT TO DO IS WALK YOU THROUGH OUR HANDOUTS WHERE I'M TO DISCUSS. THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS WHICH IS PRIMARILY FROM TUITION. AND DECEMBER CONCERNS RELATED TO DISCLOSURE. AND SOME OF OUR CONCERNS RELATED TO SEE ISSUES RESERVE POLICY. IF YOU COULD TURN TO PAGE TWO OF THE HAND OUT. SO WHAT PAGE TWO SHOWS IS BASICALLY THE VARIOUS REPORTS AS IT RELATES TO ITS OUTSIDE VESTMENTS INFORMATIONS IS WHERE THE SURPLUS FUNDS ARE ARE BEING HELD. AND IF THE QUESTION IS IF YOU MAKE FUNDING DECISIONS FOR CONSIDER RAISING TUITION. THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH OF THIS AMOUNT IS BASICALLY DISCRETIONARY OR OR AVAILABLE FOR ITS BASIC OPERATIONS. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE FROM FINDING IS RELATED TUITION AND HOW MUCH OF IT HAS GROWN OVER TIME HOW MUCH OF HIS RESERVE. NONE OF THESE REPORTS WOULD HAVE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION WHICH WE BELIEVE WOULD BE RELEVANT IN THOSE TYPE OF DECISIONS. THE FIRST TWO ROWS BACKING SUSTAINABILITY PLANET TUITION PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION. BASICALLY THOSE ARE THE TWO REPORTS THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT THAT WHERE CC DO NOT TO FULLY DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION. THAT WE FELT WAS RELEVANT TO WIN CONSIDERING. FUNDING INCREASES OR RACES INTO TUITION. THERE'S THREE REPORTS ON A REGULAR THOSE IN THE BOTTOM THREE NOT BASICALLY THESE ARE. PRETTY ROUTINE I FINANCIAL REPORTS THAT CSU AYE PROVIDES. BASICALLY WHAT THOSE REPORTS SHOW IS THAT TOTAL INVEST IN BALANCE AND IT'S BASICALLY THE FOUR FOUR BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT BOUNCE WHICH IS BASICALLY A MIX OF. RESTRICTED FUNDS AND DISCRETIONARY FUNDS WAS NOT BROKEN OUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT WAS AVAILABLE FOR ITS GENERAL OPERATIONS. IT DOES NOT SHOW DISCRETIONARY NOW TOWARD THE FACT THAT IT COMES FROM TUITION. OR THOSE OTHER FACTORS THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE SAY RELEVANT ALL THAT INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED IN THE TWO DOCUMENTS THAT WAS IN THE FIRST TWO ROWS THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE. THAT THAT'S WHAT CONSIDERATIONS WERE MONEY OR WHETHER CITY POTENTIAL CUTS TO SERVICES. SO WE RECOMMENDED THAT C. I. C. S. YOU BE DISCLOSING THAT HAVE INFORMATION TO ADD THE LEGISLATURE INTO STUDENTS WHEN CONSULTING FOR TUITION INCREASES. YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE. ONE OF THINGS THAT CSU HAS INDICATED. IS THAT IT CONSIDERS THIS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AS RESERVE YOU KNOW IT'S SIMILAR TO A RAINY DAY FUND. HOWEVER WHAT OUR CONCERN IS IF CSU REALLY WANT TO CONSIDER THIS RESERVE RELEASED OVER HOLLIS WAS OUR POLICY NOW ONE OF THE MODELS THAT TO IT I COULD USE. IS THE STATE THE STATE ECONOMIC CORPORATE SPERRY'S BEST PRACTICES RELATED TO ITS RESERVES. THAT WITHOUT THAT CC DOES NOT HALF OF FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE HAS A REGULAR AND REGAIN YOUR REPORTERS ARE BALANCES. IT ALSO IS VERY CLEAR HOW MUCH OF THE RESERVE IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL PURPOSES. HOW MUCH OF IT IS IT SHOULD BE IN THE MINIMUM CONTRIBUTIONS FOR ITS RAINY DAY FUND. HOW MUCH UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES CAN STATE USE THIS FUNDS IN CASE OF A BUDGET EMERGENCY. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT CSU DOES NOT HAPPEN THIS WAS OUR POLICY DOES NOT HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE INDICATE HOW MUCH OF A SURPLUS IS AVAILABLE FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES MINIMUM LEVEL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS OR MINIMUM BALANCE. IT DOES NOT HAVE A ADDITIONAL APPROVAL IF HE. NEEDS TO USE IT'S A RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES. THESE ARE ALL BASIC FOR PRETTY STANDARD WHO'S OUR PRACTICES. THAT WE NOW WE SEE THAT THE STATE HAS WE SEE THE OTHER UNIVERSITIES HAVE. AND WE ALSO EVEN SEE THAT CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENTS ASSOCIATION THE ACCESSORIES ARE POLICY AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF THE SAFEGUARDS THIS UC'S NOT HAVE. SO WHAT WE RECOMMEND IS THIS YES YOU I'M VISITS RIVER USER POLICY IN STRENGTH IN IT. SO THEY COULD DEMONSTRATE HOW ARE THEY YOU KNOW ENSURING THAT TUITION IS. SAYS SIDE APPROPRIATELY. OR AND PUT US USE. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. ANYTHING FROM THE LA OR JUST HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT'S RIGHT POLICY KNOWS IN WITH ANALYST'S OFFICE BUILDING ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION WAS GOING TO JUST MOVE INTO QUESTIONS YOU NOTICE HOW YOU GAVE FOR BOTH OF YOU GAVE US A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT LET ME JUST BEGIN WITH JUST THE HEADLINES THAT WE SAW IN THE PAPERS. RIGHT THAT WOULD BASICALLY STATED THAT THE ONE CS USE HIDING ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY RAISING TUITION ON STUDENTS SEEN IRATE LATER READ MORE ARTICLES AYE HEADLINE STATING THE CSU DISPUTED THE CHARACTERIZATIONS OF ITS RESERVES IN THIS OP MEDIA REPORTS USING THE WORD SUCH AS MISLEADING AND MIS CHARACTERIZED SO I JUST WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU MISS HOW REGARDING YOU KNOW HOW YOU HOW YOU IN THE MEDIA TRADE THIS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WAS A BUDDY HIT AND HAVE THESE FUNDS. BEEN PROPERLY CHARACTERIZE LET'S JUST. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. CERTAINLY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOU WILL NOT FIND THE WORD HIDDEN IN OUR AUDIT REPORT THAT IS THE SAME TERMINOLOGY THAT THE MEDIA USE WHEN WE ISSUED THE U. S. YOU SEE REPORT AND WE DIDN'T USE HIDDEN IN THAT EITHER WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THEY HAVE HIDDEN. ANY FUNDS WHAT WE'RE SAYING AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE DESCRIBE IT WE'RE SAYING THEY DID NOT FULLY DISCLOSE THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPHIC THAT MR COOLEY TO US WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU SEE THE GREEN CHECK MARKS. THOSE ARE THE THREE REPORTS THAT THE CSU ASSERTED THEY ASSERTED THEY THEY GAVE US THIRTY REPORTS IT'S THOSE THREE REPORTS EACH OF THEM THEY GIVE US TEN YEARS WORTH SO IT'S THIRTY BUDGETARY LEGAL BASIS ONE FOR EACH OF THE TEN YEARS THAT WE LOOKED AT ANNUAL INVESTMENT REPORT IN THOSE REPORTS THEY DO DISCLOSE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WHAT THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE IS. THE COMPOSITION OF THE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT TWO BILLION IS RESTRICTED SOME VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSES STUDENT HOUSING STUDENT DEVELOPED A STUDENT HOUSING THAT STUDENT STUDENT CENTER THOSE TYPES OF THINGS NOR DID THEY DISCLOSE THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS MORE DISCRETIONARY FUNDING WE TOOK OUT THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION THAT THEY WERE SUGGESTING IS. RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND THAT'S WHERE WE CAME UP WITH A ONE POINT FIVE ALMOST ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS WHERE WERE SUGGESTING THEY NEED TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT IS WHEN THEY SHARE IF YOU LOOK AT THAT GRAPHIC THE TUITION PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION THAT'S UNDER THE WORKING FAMILIES TRANSPARENCY ACT WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH STUDENTS. PRIOR TO RAISING TUITION SO THAT THE STUDENTS CAN BE ENGAGED IN THAT CONVERSATION AND PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES TO RAISING TUITION. AND THEY DIDN'T DO THAT THEY STAY SUGGESTED TO THE STUDENTS WE THEIR NET NEED TO GET MORE MONEY FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR WE NEED TO RAISE TUITION OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT PROGRAMS WHERE WE MAY. NOT BE ABLE TO GET STUDENTS GRADUATED WITHIN THE FOR FIVE YEARS AT A TARGET. THAT CERTAIN STUDENTS HAVE IN THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS. BY NOT DISCLOSING THAT INFORMATION IT PRECLUDED THE ABILITY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION THAT WHY CAN'T YOU DIP INTO THAT RESERVE. THIS YEAR WE KNOW IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE AND WE WOULD NOT ARGUE THAT YOU WANT TO DIP INTO YOUR RESERVE YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. BUT YOU DIDN'T EVEN ALLOW TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION THAT'S OUR CONCERN WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING. THEY'RE HIDING MONEY. WE CAN USE THAT TERM BUT WE CERTAINLY FEEL THAT THEY COULD BE. MORE TRANSPARENT IN DISCLOSURE OF THE FUNDS THAT THEY HAVE. SO YOU WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU WANT MORE TRANSPARENCY MORE DISCLOSURE SHOW ALL THE CARDS ON THE TABLE TO MAKE THE CORRECT POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND SORT OF. A POSSIBLE CATIONS WILL MAKE YOUR LEGISLATURE RIGHT SO THE CONVERSATION CAN HAPPEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WHEN I WAS WATCHING SOME OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEE MEETINGS. SOME OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEE MEMBER SAID WE NEED TO HAVE. CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE IT'S ALL ABOUT CHOICE. WE HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES DO WE CHOOSE AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET INTO. HOW MUCH WAS IN RESERVE THERE WASN'T DISCLOSURE TO THE TRUSTEES AT THAT PARTICULAR MEETING I WATCHED. THAT WE HAVE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN IN A RESERVE ACCOUNT OR IN OUR INVESTMENT ACCOUNT. BUT BUT IT WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT WE HAVE TO MAKE VERY DIFFICULT CHOICES AND SOMETIMES WE MAKE MAKE DECISIONS TO INCREASE TUITION. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO CUT PROGRAMS OUR CONCERN IS YOUR ONLY HEARING. PART OF THE INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT INFORMED DECISION AND TO MAKE THE BEST CHOICE. IN THE INTEREST OF THE STUDENTS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE AS THEY TO CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT TO OUR CSU SYSTEM. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU BREAKING DOWN THE FOUR BILLION. EXACTLY HOW THAT. IS DIVIDED UP NOW EARLIER WE HAD TALKED ABOUT AND THE REASON WHY THIS IS RELEVANT TO THIS. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT. THERE WAS TUITION MONEY THAT CONTRIBUTED TO. TO THE SURPLUS RIGHT AND MR CLETUS CAN ASSIST ME WITH THIS BUT BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AS I SAID THE STATUTE THAT ALLOW THE CSU OR GAVE THE CSU MORE AUTHORITY TO INVEST IN OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS. AND CERTAINLY INVEST IN AND HIGHER RISK SECURITIES AND HOPEFUL AND HOPES THAT WE WOULD GET BETTER RETURNS AS A STATE. PRECLUDED CSU FROM USING ANY GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION MONEY. IN PUTTING THAT MONEY INTO THE INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS SO THE CSU. USES ARE THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION THAT THEY RECEIVE AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THEY USE ONE TWELFTH EACH MONTH. SO IT'S BASICALLY EXHAUSTED BY THE END OF THE YEAR SO. MOST OF THE REMAINING MONEY. IS TO BE AS TUITION AND FEES THAT STUDENTS PAY SO WE ARE WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THAT MUCH OF THE MONEY IN THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR. SURPLUS IS FROM TUITION IT CANNOT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR IT TO BE FROM GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION THERE CERTAINLY EARN SOME INTEREST. AND THERE ARE SOME SOME PARAMETERS AROUND WHAT THEY CAN USE THE INTEREST EARNED FOR THAT CAN BE USED FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY. AND THOSE TYPES OF PURPOSES BUT FOR GENERAL OPERATIONS THEY DO HAVE TUITION MONEY IN THAT SURPLUS ACCOUNT. IN THE IN THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WE'RE CONFIDENT OF THAT. OKAY SO YOU WERE JUST ABLE TO DO THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE GENERAL FUND RIGHT IN OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS THIS IS WHAT'S LEFT OVER THERE FOR. THIS HAD TO COME FROM TUITION CORRECT. GOT IT RIGHT. HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS BUT I KNOW CENTER MONEY AS A QUESTION ON THIS ISSUE. WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN. CO CHAIRS. OF THE VARIOUS COMMITTEES. SO ON I THINK THE- AUDITOR AND YOUR TEAM FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS. IN A RE FREEZE I THINK A QUESTION THE CHAIR ASKED BUT IN YOUR CONCLUSIONS. WAS THERE ANY FINDING OF A VIOLATION OF LAW IN ANY OF YOUR CONCLUSIONS NOW WE DID NOT FIND ANY VIOLATION OF LAW AS WE SAID WE FELT THAT IT AND WE EXPLAIN IN THE REPORT THAT THEY DID. MANAGE THE OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS APPROPRIATELY THEY HAVE THE APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS IT CETERA SO WE DID NOT FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF ANY VIOLATIONS OF ANY LAW. SO LET'S TURN NOW TO ACCOUNTING PRACTICES IN LOOKING AT THAT GRAPHIC OKAY IT LOOKS LIKE YOU USE. AS. A BASIS OF COMPARISON STATE OF CALIFORNIA STANDARDS. IN RECORD KEEPING. OF ACCOUNTS THAT ARE NOT FOLLOWED BY SEE ISSUE. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE FROM AN ACCOUNTING POINT OF VIEW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TRANSPARENT SEEN YOU'VE SHARED THAT. BUT WOULD YOU HAVE A JUDGMENT AS TO THE ACCOUNTING PRACTICES USED OR NOT USED WELL WITH RESPECT TO THE RESERVE POLICY. AS AS MISTER KHALID SO SYNDICATED THEY REALLY NEED TO STRENGTHEN IN HIS WORDS I THINK IT'S A GREAT WORD OVERHAUL THEIR RESERVE POLICY SO THEIR ACCOUNTING PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO THEIR RESERVES. NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT ACCOUNTING FOR THE MONEY APPROPRIATELY BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE APPROPRIATE PARAMETERS AROUND HOW MUCH NEEDS TO BE AND THE RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WHAT'S THE MINIMUM AMOUNT WE IF WE AS A CAMPUS NEED TO PUT IN THERE BECAUSE A LOT OF CAMPUSES. IT YOU KNOW CONTRIBUTE MONEY TO THE INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS HOW MUCH MONEY TRIGGERS AND A MAXIMUM IF WE HAD A MAXIMUM SIMILAR WHAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S THERE'S A REVENUE REDUCTION OR TUITION CUT OR SOME OTHER CHANGE. SO AS FAR AS CHARACTERIZING THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY VIOLATING ACCOUNTING PRACTICES BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE STRONGEST BEST PRACTICES IN PLACE THAT WE BELIEVE THEY SHOULD HAVE LIKE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PUT IN PLACE WHEN IT CREATED THE RAINY DAY FUND. AND THE RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY THANK YOU THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING. FROM THE UNIVERSITY AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WHO ARE HERE TODAY I THINK. I THINK WE ALL SHARE AN ASPIRATION THAT THIS WILL LEAD. THE LEGISLATURE AND SEE ISSUE TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF HOW THE TRANSPARENCY IS TRANSLATE A BALL TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON WHO BENEFIT FROM THE UNIVERSITY THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS THE BUDGET AND WHICH ONES TUITION FUNDS AND WHETHER TUITION FUNDS WERE USED TO CREATE. A SURPLUS AT THE SAME TIME TUITION WAS GOING UP. SO WITH THAT WOULD MOVE TO THE A QUESTION BY SOMEONE MEMBER BEEN DENIED THAT TO SENATOR PAT. QUESTION TO A MISS HOUSE HAVING SERVED AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT MAINTAINING RESERVES IN ORDER TO MITIGATE VOLATILITY AND FUNDING CASH FLOW SAVE FOR LARGE PURCHASES OBTAIN HIGHER CREDIT RATING AND OTHER PURPOSES. COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO ME AND TO COMMITTEE HERE WHAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RESERVES AND WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE AS SURPLUS AS ACCUMULATED BY THE SEA ISSUE OR ARE THE TERMS INTERCHANGEABLE. I'M SO ARE WE IT WAS SURPLUS BASICALLY IS ALL THE MONEY THAT TNCS VESTMENT ACCOUNTS THESE ARE SURPLUS FUNDS ANYTIME CSU DOES NOT NEED TO USE THAT MONEY FOR ITS KERN OPERATIONS A GOES TO THESE ACCOUNTS IN THE ACCRUE INTEREST. AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT SURPLUS. CSU. HAS CHOSEN TOO YOU KNOW OKAY ACOSTA WITHOUT A RESERVE AND BASICALLY. WHICH IS FINE BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT IF YOU COULD CALL THAT A RESERVE YOU HAVE SERVICE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE WHERE IT'S BASICALLY. ARE PROTECTED TO ENSURE THAT IT'S ONLY IF IT'S A RAINY DAY FUND IT'S ONLY USED FOR. IN A BUDGET EMERGENCY THAT'S ONLY USED FOR AB DOESN'T NAY PURPOSES WE HAVE NOT SEEN THOSE KIND OF SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE INTO USE USERS ARE POLICY. THANK YOU MOVED SENATOR AND THEN THE SENATE ROBINSON YOUR LEYVA. I THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION FROM THE HONOR I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING YOU SAID YOUR TESTIMONY YOU. AND I DON'T REMEMBER. PRECISELY THE NUMBERS YOU READ BUT YOU MADE MENTION THAT THE. TUITION INCREASES SUPPLIED ABOUT WAS IT EIGHTY SOME MILLION THEIR TUITION INCREASE FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN GENERATED APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. OKAY AND THE RESERVE GREW OR THE IT COULD APPROXIMATELY I THINK IT WAS ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AT SAME TIME FRAME OKAY SO THIS IS SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SO CORRECT POSTS IS RECESSION BUT STILL. SO STILL THE. WHAT THE TUITION INCREASE ESSENTIALLY FUNDED THE I MEAN THAT IT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE TUITION INCREASE THE PORTION WELLS DOUBTS FAIRLY DEVELOPED LET'S VISIT THE PORTION OF THE TUITION INCREASE THAT WENT. TO I GUESS IMPROVING OPERATIONS OR WHATEVER LISTS. WAS SAID TO DO IS ACTUALLY A VERY SMALL PORTION OF WHAT WAS OF THE TO INCREASE THAT WAS SPENT ON THAT POTENTIALLY POTENTIALLY THAT THAT'S CORRECT I MEAN WE'RE LOOKING AT AND A YEAR NUMBERS AND THERE'S FLUCTUATION THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BUT BUT IT STRUCK ME WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS. I'M AND THEY DO LEARN SOME SOME INTEREST ON THE ACCOUNTS BUT IT WAS IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT YOU HAVE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN. THIS SURPLUS ACCOUNT. YOU RAISE TUITION TO GENERATE SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND YOUR RESERVE ACCOUNT WENT UP. AND MOST OF THE FUNDING THAT GOES INTO THOSE THIS SURPLUS AS WE REFER TO IT AND AN INTERCHANGEABLE I MEAN ONE OF THE- THE ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTION MISTER MEDINA IS. THERE ISN'T SPECIFIC PARAMETERS THAT CSU AS LAID OUT AS FAR AS HOW MUCH SHOULD BE A RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY HOW MUCH SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES THAT'S WHY. WE'RE SAYING YOU HAVE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ARE ON TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN SURPLUS. HELLO ESTABLISH THOSE PARAMETERS A STELLAR THE MINIMUMS THAT YOU WANT ESTABLISH THE MAXIMUM OKAY THAT SHOULD TRIGGER REDUCTION. SO I DON'T MEAN TO GO BACK TO HIM BUT BUT CENTER PAN THAT'S- THAT'S WHAT STRUCK ME WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION IT'S LIKE. AND THE CONCERNED THE REASON WE HAVE THE CONCERNED ABOUT NOT FULLY DISCLOSING THIS INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND CERTAINLY TO THE STUDENTS SO THAT THERE COULD BE A DISCUSSION. WE ARE GOING TO GENERATE SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IF WE RAISE TUITION FOLLOW QUESTION SO. THIS WAS NOT DISCLOSED TO THE STUDENT GROUP THAT. WHEN THAT THAT IT'S BEST WITH THIS WELL LET'S WAS A- I WAS IT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS CLOSE TO BUT WAS NOT BROUGHT UP IN A DISCUSSION WHEN THEY'VE SAID WELL WE A PROPOSED TO INCREASE TUITION AND DATE IN EXPLAINED THAT PART I MEAN THERE'S THERE ARE SOMETIMES YOU KNOW. TUITIONS ONE OF THE SOURCES OF REVENUE RIGHT IN THE HABIT DAYS THIS IS THE ONLY HAS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF. SOURCES REVENUE SOME FROM US IN TUITION. MAYBE SOME FROM GRANTS OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AND THEN INVESTMENTS RIGHT AND IN THE- AND ONE COULD ARGUE THAT. DURING GOOD TIMES AND SINCE A SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THAT'S A GUESS A- THAT. THAT THAT'S WHEN YOU WANT TO BUILD UP. YOUR RESERVES ARE SORT OF WHATEVER. BUT SAME TIME. IN YOUR REVIEW OF. BUT THERE'S A TRUSTEE MEETINGS ARE. THE DAYS THE US THE MAIN STUDENT THAT THE MINUTES WHATEVER YOU REVIEWED. THAT WAS NOT EXPLODE THAT WAS NOT THE EXPLICIT REASON AND ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS GIVEN FOR INCREASING TUITION THAT WHAT WE WANT TO BUILD UP RESERVES AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE INCREASING TUITION. EXACTLY THAT THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT SENATOR SO THAT THE REQUIREMENT IS IT'S THE WORKING FAMILIES TRANSPARENCY ACT AND IT SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES. CSU TO REACH OUT TO STUDENT GROUPS. IF THEY'RE COULDN'T CONTEMPLATING A TUITION INCREASE AND WHAT THE THEY'RE LANGUAGE REQUIRES IS. ONE OF THE ELEMENTS HAS TO BE ALTERNATIVES TO THAT. SO WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE IN THAT. REPORT TO THE STUDENTS. AN OPTION OF WE HAVE A RESERVE WE COULD USE THAT TO OFFSET ANY TUITION THERE IS A DATABASE THAT WAS NOT. DISCUSSED THE ONLY OPTIONS. LAID OUT IN THE REPORT TO THE STUDENTS WAS. WE NEED TO GET MORE MONEY FROM THE STATE. OR WE RAISE TUITION IF WE DON'T WE HAVE TO CUT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. THERE WAS NEVER A DISCUSSION IN. THE REPORT THAT I LOOK AT WITH RESPECT TO THIS. THAT'S TUITION PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION WORKING FAMILIES ACT. THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION IN THERE ABOUT USING ANY TYPE OF RESERVE OKAY SO JUST TO BE CLEAR DAYS I MEAN STE. GIVEN THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE MONEY. L. LEE SEEMS LIKE HELPED BUILD THE RESERVE DATING GO AND SAY IT'S A PAID REASON WE WANT TO. INCREASED TUITION IS BECAUSE WE WANT TO. IMPROVE OUR RESERVES WHICH ARE OF THIS SIZE WE WILL BECOME LARGER IN CASE WE HAVE FUTURE DOWNTURN THAT WAS NOT THE MAIN REASON THAT THERE'S NO DISCUSSION NOT I THAT I SAW ON IN THE REPORT THAT I REVIEWED AND THE CHAIR OF THE COURT SHARED WITH THE STUDENTS OKAY THANK YOU NOTES RIGHT AND RATHER NO SENSE ALSO BE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH THE TIME FOR. THE OTHER THING I WANTED SO THIS IS SPECIFICALLY FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IS THIS A BEHAVIOR THAT YOU SAW ON PRIOR YEARS AS WELL OR I MEAN ONE COULD ARGUE WE JUST PICKED UP ONE REALLY BAD YEAR WHAT IT DIDN'T DO IT I MEAN IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WE STATUS BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU LOOK AT TEN YEARS. RIGHT AND MISTER COOLEY TELLS CAN ASSIST BUT WHEN PROP THIRTY PASSED THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CSU THAT THEY WOULD NOT RAISE TUITION DURING THAT TIME FRAME SO DURING A FOUR FIVE YEAR WINDOW THERE WERE NO TUITION INCREASES BECAUSE PROP THIRTY GENERATED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CSU BENEFITTED FROM THAT NOW IN THE PRIOR YEARS I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO STAFF. I DON'T KNOW THAT THE WORKING FAMILIES TRANSPARENCY ACT WAS IN EFFECT IN THE EARLIER YEARS THAT WE LOOKED AT THAT SOME MORE RECENT STATUTES OKAY BUT. ALSO MAKE NOTE BASED ON. ONE OF THE GRASS HERE THAT THE RESERVE HAD ACTUALLY SEEM TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE EVEN DURING YEARS WHICH I REMEMBER WE'RE NOT SO GOOD FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND SO WHAT I'LL CSU MAY STRUGGLE WE HEARD FROM DOCTOR WEBER WAS EXACTLY NUMBER THE TIME. THAT THEY HAD RESERVES THAT THEY CONTINUE TO INCREASE THEY WEREN'T DIPPING INTO AT THOSE TIMES IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT THE FIGURE WE HAVE IN THE REPORT SHOWS THERE WAS FLAT FOR SOME YEARS BUT WE NEVER REALLY SAW. A PRECIPITOUS DECLINE IN THE RESERVE SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY USE THOSE RESERVE AMOUNTS TO CONTINUE THEIR OPERATIONS DURING. RECESSIONARY TIMES. THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION I UNFORTUNATELY PROBABLY WILL HAVE TO LEAVE BEFORE THE CSU HAS YET TO EXPLAIN BUT I'M SURE OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO ASK. THEM TO EXPLAIN THAT. PATTERN THANK YOU. THIRTY CENTER PAN YEAH THAT'S A QUESTION BELIEVE WE HAVE FOR THE CSU AS WELL WHAT IS SENATOR ROBB. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MADAM WATER GOOD TO SEE YOU THANK YOU CENTER. YOU KNOW IN THE INTERESTS OF OPERATIONS AND TRANSPARENCY IT'S CERTAINLY IMPORTANT I THINK AND YOU'VE NOTED. THE ONE INSTITUTION SETS UP A RESERVE ACCOUNT THAT THERE BE A PLAN FOR. HOW AND WHEN TO USE IT I'M NOT. SURE IN MY RECOLLECTION THAT OUR STATE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY IS SUPPOSED TO THE RAINY DAY FUND. HAS A LOT OF DETAIL AS TO WHEN THAT USED A EXCEPT AS TO. WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE GOVERNOR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LEGISLATURE PROPOSED TO USE IT AM I CORRECT. RIGHT SO THAT THE SEPARATE ONE THESE ARE FOR THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY ON BASICALLY THAT'S- DISCRETIONARY SERVE MAYBE WE SHOULD SET UP SOME RULES FOR THAT TOO RIGHT AND WHAT THAT ONE DOES THE DIFFERENT DIFFERENCE IS THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE THIS IS THE NOT THIS IN A RAINY DAY FUND THIS THEM OUT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE FINDS YOU COULD KIND OF DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE TWO. WE DO LOOK AT THAT BUT PUTTING THAT ASIDE. ASSUMING AN APPROPRIATE. RESERVE PLAN IS IN PLACE OR PROPER ONE. META MONITOR BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE AND IT IS SIGNIFICANT. WHAT LEVEL OF RESERVE WOULD YOU EXPECT TO FIND AND SEE ISSUE IS AN INSTITUTION. TALKING ABOUT TWO THINGS HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROCESS AND TRANSPARENCY BUT THE MORE INFLAMMATORY PIECE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE SIZE. OF THE CORPUS HERE THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. OF THAT WE ALL SEEM TO BE FOCUSED ON SOME HIS MOTIVATION CLEAR YOUR QUESTION IS CLEAR IT'S AT AS ALWAYS A DIFFICULT QUESTION BECAUSE THE RESERVE POLICY THAT THE CSU NEEDS TO DO SOME ANALYSIS SOME HISTORICAL ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE. WHAT HAPPENED DURING THOSE RECESSIONARY TIMES WE RAISE TUITION IF WE WANT TO AVOID DOING THAT IN THE FUTURE IF WE HAVE A RECESSION HOW MUCH MONEY DO WE HAVE TO HAVE IN RESERVE SO IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING TO DEPEND UPON THE PARAMETERS. AND THE INFORMATION THAT THE CSU WANTS TO USE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH MONEY THEY NEED TO PUT IN THE RESERVE AND OF COURSE YOU WANT TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY IN RESERVE. AND THEY TALK ABOUT 10% FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FUTURE SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE ESTABLISHING A RESERVE POLICY AND CERTAIN RESERVE AMOUNTS. DEPENDING UPON WHAT YOU'RE GONNA USE THAT RESERVE FOR IF YOU HAD IF IN FACT SEE ISSUE HAD PUT IN PLACE AN APPROPRIATE RESERVE POLICY WITH. CRITERIA EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T% NECESSARILY DO THAT AND BOTH OF A AND R. RESERVE ACCOUNTS HERE ALL OF THEM HERE AT THE STATE. WOULD YOU HAVE FOUND THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION TO BE UNREASONABLE AS A RESERVE FOR INSTITUTION. OF LIKE SEE ISSUE. AND THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER I WOULD WANT TO KNOW IF THEY HAD AN APPROPRIATE POLICY AND THEY HAD LAID OUT EXACTLY HOW THEY WERE INTENDING TO USE. THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND WHAT THE VARIOUS AMOUNTS WERE SET ASIDE FOR. THEN WE WOULD HAVE DONE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF ANALYSIS. BUT THE MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT THE EQUALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN MY MIND IS THE DISCLOSURE OF THE- OF THE SURPLUS A RESERVE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO REFER TO IT AS- BUT- BUT- WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T TELL US. THEY THEY ESSENTIALLY HAD TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND SAID WE'RE GONNA SET ASIDE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FOR RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. AND THEN WE'VE GOT THE OTHER ONE POINT FIVE BILLION AND BASICALLY SAYING. WELL IF YOU RUN INTO DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES WE'RE GONNA NEED TO DIP INTO THAT. WITHOUT REALLY EXPLAINING OKAY HOW MUCH. WOULD YOU NEED TO DEPEND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT PARAMETERS IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVER GOING TO CUT OFF FUNDING FOR THE CSU SYSTEM. THE REALITY OF THAT IS PROBABLY QUITE SLIM I WOULD HOPE. SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT NEED TO GO INTO THE THOUGHT PROCESS. IN DEVELOPING A RESERVE POLICY IN ESTABLISHING WHAT THAT RESERVE AMOUNT SHOULD BE. AND I DON'T MEAN I DON'T DISAGREE IN TERMS OF. PROCESS I'M JUST TRYING IS A BUDGET TEARS BECAUSE I DO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE THINGS SO. EVERY YEAR I'M JUST TRYING TO. GET SOME INFORMATION SO THAT NEXT YEAR WHEN WE START THE BUDGET PROCESS AGAIN I CAN EVALUATE RESERVE ACCOUNTS VIS A VIS. OF THE SEA ISSUE BUDGET REQUEST DO YOU DO YOU DO EITHER OF YOU RECALL WHAT PERCENTAGE. THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION REPRESENTS OF THE TOTAL SEE ISSUE OPERATING BUDGET. I RECALL THE WHAT WHAT PERCENTAGE IT'S YOU KNOW MAYBE 1015% OF THE CSU COULD PROBABLY PROVIDE SOMETHING MORE ACCURATE INFORMATION. BUT BASICALLY THOUGH IT I'M TO YOUR QUESTION IN TERMS OF AS A SOMEONE THIS REVIEW IN THE BUDGET. I THINK THERE'S A BALANCE THAT I THINK STAKEHOLDERS ONE OF STRIKE ON THE ONE HAND YOU WANT TO BUILD A PRUDENT RESERVE FOR THAT YOU KNOW PROTECTS AGAINST ECONOMIC BAD ECONOMIC TIMES. BUT THE FACT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT TUITION THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS HOW DO YOU ALSO BOUNCE THAT WITH AFFORDABILITY AND MAKING SURE THAT THIS MONEY SPORTS THE BEST USE. SO THAT THE REASON WHY DISCLOSURE SUPPORT INTO IS THAT WE IS SUPPORTED THAT YOU SPECIFIC IDENTIFIED THIS IS THEM OUT THIS MONEY BY TUITION IS THE MOST SURPLUS. THAT IS THAT WERE USING TUITION TO MAINTAIN AND THAT WAY STAKEHOLDER STUDENTS THE LEGISLATURE COULD DISCUSS. OKAY WELL WHAT'S THE RIGHT AMOUNT IS THIS THE RIGHT NOT FOR A RESERVE OR HEY YOU KNOW DO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. TUITION RATES REMAIN AFFORDABLE SO WHAT IF I'M UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PRESENTATION. CORRECTLY THE ONLY REASON THAT THIS. THIS PART OF MONEY CONSISTS OF TUITION DOLLARS OR THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WE PUT ON. THE SEA ISSUE AND THE WAY THE C. ISSUE SPENDS ITS MONEY THROUGH THE YEARS THAT CORRECT. RIGHT IF WE HAD NOT PUT THOSE RESTRICTIONS ON THE SEA ISSUE. TERMS OF DRAW DOWN BY MONTHS IN WHICH FUNDS ARE USED WHEN. THIS POT OF MONEY WOULD BE A MIXTURE OF TUITION IN GENERAL FUND MONEY CORRECT. A RIGHT POTENTIALLY HONEST UC'S PRACTICE IT IS THOUGH TO SPEND AT THE GENERAL FUND FINDS ON IS FIXED COSTS LIKE IT'S PAYROLL. WE REQUIRE THAT DILLON. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS BUT THAT'S BASICALLY GOT A CABLE THREAT AND MOUNTED THEN JENNIFER COVERS UP TO A CERTAIN POINT. AND THEN DOES BASICALLY PAID FOR AND THEN THE REST IS COVERED BY. OKAY THANK YOU I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS I CERTAINLY AGREE WE NEED SOME PROCESS IMPROVEMENT HERE BUT- WE MAY FIND IT SEE ISSUE AGREES TO. YES SIR SEC HELLO. SENATE ROTH YET A QUESTION ABOUT THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WHAT IS IT REPRESENTS THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WAS AS OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND- I BELIEVE THERE ABOUT SIX POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN EXPENDITURES OPERATING EXPENSES THAT YEAR FOR CSU. SO THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION REPRESENTS ABOUT 20% OF OPERATING EXPENSES WHICH IS ABOUT. TWO TWO AND A HALF MONTHS WOTH OF OPERATING EXPENSES SO JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT OKAY TWO TO TWO AND A HALF MONTHS OF. OF OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE INSTITUTION THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER THANKS THAT ARE OUT THERE I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE STAFF WAS TELLING ME THE NUMBERS THEY RAN WAS ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. AS WELL SO WITH THAT WE WILL TO SENATOR LEYVA. THAN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO THAN SENATOR DRAWS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM AUDITOR I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR TEAM FOR THE VERY THOROUGH REPORT VERY VERY HELPFUL. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE AUDITED CSU. IN ANY CAPACITY. WE AUDITED CSU ON BEHALF OF DOCTOR WEBER I'M GOING TO GUESS IT'S PROBABLY TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO OKAY. WE JUST ON AT THEM AS ISSUES COME UP. TYPICALLY THE AUDITS AS YOU KNOW THAT COME TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE ARE COME THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE SO IT'S UP TO INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS TO DECIDE IF THEY WANT US TO AUDIT CSU WE DO NOT AUDIT SEE ISSUE ON A REGULAR BASIS SO BIG BECAUSE THIS WAS SUCH A SURPRISING AMOUNT TO I THINK. ALL OF US HAVE WE EVER BEFORE LOOK AT THEIR FINANCES AND KNOWING THAT THERE WAS ANY KIND OF A SURPLUS. OR RESERVE ARMED BEFORE CALLING A BALL. FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE LAST THOUGHT IT WE DID ON BEHALF OF DOCTOR WEBER WAS LOOKING AT SOME OTHER BUDGETING PRACTICES I DON'T RECALL A DISCUSSION AND THAT AUDIT REPORT WITH RESPECT TO ANY RESERVE AMOUNTS OR OR SURPLUS AMOUNTS. WITH RESPECT TO I MEAN THEY HAVE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHICH STILL REFER TO. AGAIN THOSE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL SHOW CERTAIN INFORMATION BUT IT DOES NOT SHOW.THE DISCRETIONARY AMOUNTS IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T AT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STATEMENTS WOULDN'T GO INTO THAT KIND OF DETAIL. SO WITHOUT AN AUDIT IN THE FUTURE WE WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT THE RESERVES ARE THE SURPLUS IS TWO YEARS FROM NOW THREE YEARS FROM NOW. WELL THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUGGESTING IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT IN THE REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE. CERTAINLY AS PART OF THE ACADEMIC SUSTAINABILITY PLAN OR SOME OTHER REPORTS THAT ARE SUBMITTED TO THROUGH THE BUDGET COMMITTEES YOUR COMMITTEE MISTER MCCARTY'S COMMITTEE. THAT THE CSU ACTUALLY DO REPORT THAT INFORMATION. AND ESSENTIALLY BREAK IT DOWN FOR THE LEGISLATURE SO THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTANDS. THE PORTIONS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY RESTRICTED AND THE PORTIONS THAT ARE MORE DISCRETIONARY. PERFECT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT I CONSISTENTLY HERE FROM USE OF RESERVE POLICY AND THE REPORTING. RIGHT WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO THAN SENATOR DRAWS A. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR ME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WE APPRECIATE YOUR WORK I IN THE PAST AND CERTAINLY I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR THIS IS NOT ILLEGAL BUT IT SURE DOESN'T LOOK GOOD IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. AND YOU KNOW WHEN I START TAKING A LOOK AT THIS I REMEMBER WHEN YOU PRESENTED BEFORE US ON THE UC DOLLARS BUT THIS BY COMPARISON LOOKS LIKE THE UC PROBLEM ON STEROIDS AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS. COULD WE TALK ABOUT BE WITH BILLIONS AND YOU KNOW I'VE GOT GOT SOME CONCERN AS YOU DO WITH THE NOT BEING FORTHCOMING WITH STUDENTS WHEN WERE RAISING TUITION ACT I SHOULD THE SAME CONCERN. AS IT RELATES TO. CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE BARGAINING UNITS BUT I WONDER IF YOU MIGHT WANT TO COMMENT ON SOME OF THE EFFORTS IN THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WHEN WE WERE ON ADVOCATING FOR MORE DOLLARS FOR THE CSU SYSTEM THE ASSUMPTION WAS THAT IF WE DIDN'T FIGHT HARD FOR MORE DOLLARS THE UC SYSTEM THAT THE SKY WOULD FALL. AND IN FACT MANY OF MANY OF US HERE PUT ON SOCKS AND ADVOCATED AND WE WERE ALL ABOUT MAKING SURE THE UC SYSTEM THE CSU SYSTEM GOD DOLLARS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES WE REALLY. REALLY BELIEVE IN THE SYSTEM. BUT TAKE A LOOK BACK NOW AND HAVING YOU FIND ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. ONE OF THE COMMENT YOU CAN MAKE ABOUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS ALMOST THE DIPPING OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT MAKE US FIGHT FOR ALL THESE DOLLARS. OF ONE NOT NOT. NOT NECESSARILY KNOWING THAT THERE'S- A BILLION DOLLARS OR SO AT THE TIME. IN RESERVES AND AGAIN IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE SAYING HEY YOU SHOULD HAVE RESERVE RAINY DAY. THAT'S A DIFFERENT QUESTION FOR THIS. BUT CERTAINLY WE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE SOME SORT OF GENERAL UNDERSTANDING WHEN WE'RE GOING INTO THIS NO WONDER IF YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THAT THAT INTERACTION WELL CERTAINLY ASSEMBLY MORE SANTIAGO THAT THAT'S THE CONCERN WE HAD AND THAT'S WHY WE FOCUSED QUITE A BIT ON AND MY COMMENTS TODAY FOCUS ON TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE IT'S AS I SAID WE'RE WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY ARGUING THAT THE CSU SHOULD NOT HAVE A PRUDENT RESERVE BUT THEY SHOULD FULLY DISCLOSE WHAT THEIR PLANS ARE THEY SHOULD HAVE VERY SPECIFIC PLANS A STRONG POLICY BUT THEN THEY SHOULD DISCLOSE THAT TO THE LEGISLATURE. BECAUSE IN THAT ACADEMIC SUSTAINABILITY PLAN THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE SENDS A LETTER TO THE C. ISSUE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND SAYS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO THE CSU AND THE INFORMATION THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING TODAY WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE MATERIALS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT'S A CONCERN THAT WE RAISE IN THE AUDIT REPORT AND THE CONCERN WE CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AGAIN IT'S FULL TRANSPARENCY SO THAT THE DISCUSSION CAN HAPPEN THE DISCUSSION CAN BE WE NEED TO HAVE A RESERVE WE BELIEVE WE NEED X. AMOUNT BASED ON THE ANALYSIS WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST. WE'VE GOT TO IF YOU AGREE LEGISLATURE WITH THAT. NOTION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE X. AMOUNT IN RESERVE THEN WE STILL NEED AND IN ADDITION AN INCREASE IN THE APPROPRIATION FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR- THERE'S A DECISION THAT THE-APPROPRIATION DOES NOT NEED TO INCREASE. BUT THE CONVERSATION CAN'T HAPPEN IF THE LEGISLATURE WAS IN GIVEN ALL OF THE INFORMATION. AND THROUGH THE TERMINATE FOLLOW UP ON THAT. THANK YOU. AND IF YOU DON'T EVEN IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT LEGISLATION BEFORE US. AT LEAST I WAS LED TO BELIEVE WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT A STEP INCREASES. FROM MY COLLEAGUE IN SAN DIEGO WHAT WHEN SHE BROUGHT THAT UP I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A QUESTION OF AFFORDABILITY. AND IF IT'S A QUESTION OF AFFORDABILITY I HAVE A HARD TIME RECONCILING I REALIZE YOU BUT THIS IS MY- MY FRUSTRATION. I HAVE A HARD TIME RECONCILING THAT WE HAVE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE NOT. WE'RE HEARING THE QUESTIONABLE FOR ABILITY WHEN IT COMES TO. STEP INCREASES. NO WONDER IF THERE'S ANY COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE I. ON DIG IN A LITTLE BIT HERE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE. LIKE LIKE MAYBE MAYBE WASN'T FORTHCOMING TO THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL. I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION I CAN'T COMMENT ON DISCUSSIONS WITH RESPECT TO A BARGAINING. YOU KNOW IN IN THE UNION AND THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK FOR THE CSU SYSTEM BUT CLEARLY THE CONCERNS WE RAISE IN THE AUDIT REPORT CAN. YOU KNOW FLOW FURTHER THAN JUST SHARING WITH OLD WITH THE STUDENTS AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE CHEERING WITH THE UNIONS AND SHARING YOU KNOW BEING FULLY TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE C. ISSUE FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES. THANK YOU WITH A ONE DOES SENATOR DRAWS A. I THINK YOU'VE REALLY JUMPED INTO MY QUESTION WHICH WAS THE FACT OF NOT SHARING THIS INFORMATION YOU SPENT YOU EXPLAIN TO US THE IMPACT PROBABLY ON OF THE STUDENTS THROUGH THE INCREASE IN TUITION OF MY COLLEAGUE JUST MENTIONED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WHAT OTHER WAYS. WHAT OTHER WAYS WOULD OR WHAT OTHER IN WHAT OTHER WAYS WOULD THERE HAVE BEEN AN IMPACT. OF NOT HAVING SHARE THIS INFORMATION I'M TRYING TO YOU KNOW THE. IT I MEAN IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND IN THE TIME PERIOD SO. HOW WOULD THAT HAVE BENEFITTED. I DON'T KNOW THROUGH WHOSE EYES WHO WHO HOW DID BENEFIT US SEE IS YOU TO NOT SHARE THIS AS OPENLY AND AS CLEARLY AS POSSIBLE. WHAT WHAT OTHER IMPACTS. YEAH THAT OR COULD THAT HAVE HAPPENED. WITH RESPECT TO THE PERSPECTIVE AYE AYE AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THAT THE CHANCELLOR IS HERE I WANT TO GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE CS USE PERSPECTIVE BUT BUT THERE IT WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY SHARING WITH THE STUDENTS SHARING WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S FAR AS DECISION MAKING AS FAR AS FINDING THE CSU SYSTEM. AND TUITION MONEY CAN BE USED FOR INSTRUCTIONAL PURPOSES AND FOR VARIOUS PROGRAMS I KNOW THEY HAVE THE GRADUATION TWENTY TWENTY FIVE INITIATIVE SO COULD THEY HAVE USED SOME OF THOSE FUNDS THAT ARE NOW IN THIS SURPLUS RESERVE ACCOUNT TO PROVIDE MORE SERVICES TO STUDENTS MORE INSTRUCTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ABILITY TO GRADUATE SOONER WE DIDN'T DIVE INTO ALL OF THE SPECIFICS IN THE AUDIT REPORT WE REALLY WANTED TO FOCUS ON. WHAT ARE THE STATE REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO REPORTING AND THE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE BELIEVE THE CSU SHOULD EMBRACE AND SHOULD IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT WITH RESPECT TO TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND KNOWING. WHO WOULD YOU. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE AT WHAT POINT AT WHAT LEVEL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT SHARING NOT INCLUDING THAT INFORMATION NOT GIVING THE REPORTS TO. PEOPLE WERE IMPACTED. WELL IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WORKING FAMILY THE TRANSPARENCY ACT I MEAN AT ALL ULTIMATELY I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE IN AND AGAIN MR WHITE THE CHANCELLOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE C. ISSUE BUT YOU'VE GOT OTHER INDIVIDUALS I I'M ONLY AS GOOD AS THE STAFF THAT WORK FOR ME. BELIEVE ME. I AM THE I'VE ALWAYS SAID ON THE FACE OF THIS ORGANIZATION I'VE TREMENDOUSLY TALENTED PEOPLE WORKING FOR ME SO YOU HAVE ON OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING THOSE MATERIALS TOGETHER I DON'T KNOW I WOULD DEFER TO MISTER WHITE AS FAR AS WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING THE MATERIALS TOGETHER TO SHARE WITH THE STUDENTS SO SEE ATION I THINK IT WOULD BE SOME OF THE BUDGET FOLKS AS FAR AS SHARING INFORMATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE THAT CERTAINLY COMES FROM. ONTO HIM TO SHARE ANY FURTHER. I CANNOT BELIEVE ESTHER'S STAND HOUSING MIGHT HAVE A COMMENT ON THIS RIGHT. ONE OF THE WAYS THAT CAMPUSES BUILDER RESERVES BY SPECIFICALLY BUDGETING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SPENDING FOR RESERVES SO THEY'LL BUDGET MONEY FOR SALARIES FOR BENEFITS FOR TRAVEL AND OPERATIONS. AS WELL AS GENERAL OPERATIONS AS WELL AS FOR RESERVES IN MAINE IN MANY CASES SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. TO THE X. THERE'S TWO WEEKS THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY COST IN A WAY IF THE CAMPUS IS BUDGETING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY SAY MILLION DOLLARS TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN A CERTAIN YEAR. TWO RESERVES FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT'S A THAT'S COMING AT THE EXPENSE OF SOMETHING ELSE THAT COULD BE FUNDED INSTEAD AND SO RIGHT NOW. IT'S NOT. CLEAR. WHICH CAMPUSES ARE BUDGETING WHAT AMOUNTS IT'S BECOMING CLEAR WITH THE PORTAL THAT MENTIONED EARLIER OF THE TRANSPARENCY PORTAL THAT JUST WENT LIVE IN MAY THERE'S SOME GOOD DAY OUR DATA THERE IT IS QUITE HARD TO NAVIGATE RIGHT NOW I PERSONALLY HAVE SPENT SOME TIME ON IT AND NEEDED QUITE A TUTORIAL. SO THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY THOUGH TO GET MUCH MORE GRANULAR DATA ABOUT CAMPUS RESERVES WHAT THEY'RE RESERVING PUTTING ASIDE FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES AND THAT WILL ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION IN BUDGET HEARINGS AND OTHER HEARINGS ABOUT WHY THEY'RE PUTTING THAT MONEY AWAY FOR RESERVES AND WHAT COULD THEY USE THAT MONEY INSTEAD BECAUSE PERHAPS THE LEGISLATURE HAS. OTHER PRIORITIES FOR THAT MONEY. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT I WITHOUT WILL MOVE TO. MR MURATSUCHI THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AS HELL I WAS FOLLOWING. THIS HEARING IN MY OFFICE AND ALONG WITH ALL OF THE- QUESTIONS AND THE CONVERSATION THAT THIS. JOINT COMMITTEE HAS BEEN TAKEN. IN THIS HEARING WELL I WANTED TO. SHE TO ALL OF THE. FINDINGS IN THE REPORT AND I WAS GOING THROUGH SOME THE MATERIALS AND TRYING TO FORESEE. WHAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IS GOING TO BE SAYING. THERE IS A LETTER THAT THE OFFICER CHANCELLOR ISSUED ON AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THAT THE CHANCE OR WHITE SPECIFICALLY REFERS TO AND ONE OF HIS EDITORIALS REGARDING SOME OF YOUR FINDINGS AND ON PAGE SIX DO YOU HAVE A COPY OF THE LETTER. PAGE SIX THE LETTER SAYS THE BALANCE AVAILABLE DESIGNATED FOR CSU OPERATIONS HELD IN THE SWIFT ACCOUNT AS OF JUNE THIRTY TWENTY SEVENTEEN TOTALED ONE POINT EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS EQUAL TO APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS OF OPERATING EXPECTS BENCHERS IS THAT THE. DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS IS YOU CHARACTERIZE IT. THAT'S CORRECT SO IN FACT AS OF AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE THAT WAS DISCLOSED TO THE GROUP OF LEGISLATORS RIGHT BUT BUT IF YOU REFER IF YOU LOOK AT THE LIST OF FUNDS AND YOU GET TO THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION AND YOU SEE THE EDUCATION CODE SO THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE SUGGESTING THAT THESE ARE STATUTORY DESIGNATION STATUTORY RESTRICTIONS WHAT WE HAVE A CONCERN WITH IS THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT EXPLAINING THAT THIS IS DISCRETIONARY MONEY THEY CERTAINLY HAVE THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IDENTIFIED THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY. ANSWERING THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THESE FUNDS ARE DISCRETIONARY CAN BE BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES WELL IT DOES SAY THAT THE BALANCE IS THE DESIGNATED FOR CSU OPERATIONS RIGHT A YEAR INDICATING THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GREATER CLARITY THAT THOSE WERE FOR DISCRETIONARY OPERATIONS I THINK THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GREATER CLARITY IT NOT ONLY IN THIS LETTER BUT IN A SUBSEQUENT LETTER TO MISTER SANTIAGO WHERE MISTER SANTIAGO SPECIFICALLY ASKED HOW MUCH OF THIS MONEY IS DISCRETIONARY AND WHAT THEY'RE SUGGESTING IS. IT'S BEEN EARMARKED FOR DESIGNATED PURPOSES AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE THIS FUN THESE FUNDS ARE ARE FLEXIBLE AND THEY CAN USE THEM FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES. THAT'S WHAT THE CONCERN WE HAD. ALL RIGHT SO AGAIN IT FOCUSES ON. THE COMMON THEME OF QUESTIONS THAT I'VE HEARD SEVERAL MEMBERS ASKING THE LACK OF A POLICY THE CLERK DID DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A RESERVE IN A DISCUSSION AYE SIR WELL I THINK THAT I THINK IT'S MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE A CLEAR RESERVE POLICY AND THEN ABSOLUTELY FULL DISCLOSURE I MEAN THIS IS AN AMOUNT SHOWN IN ONE LETTER ITS NOT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR IN MY OPINION AND OUR OPINION. THAT THIS MADE IT IT CLEAR TO THE MEMBERS WHO RECEIVE THIS LETTER THAT THESE ARE FUNDS THAT THEY CAN DEPEND TO FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE I MEAN SCOTT OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOTTA BE TIED TO OPERATIONS WHAT THEY'RE ARGUING NOW IS THIS MONEY NEEDS TO BE KEPT IN THE RESERVE ACCOUNT FOR IT RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY FOR DOWN TRENDS IN THE ECONOMY ETCETERA. DID THE CONCERN WE HAD AS I WAS DISCUSSING IS THERE WASN'T DISCLOSURE THAT THESE FUNDS CAN BE USED EITHER PERHAPS OFFSET TUITION INCREASES IT WASN'T SURE WITH SHARED WITH THE STUDENTS IT WASN'T SHARED WITH THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THEY SUBMITTED THEIR ACADEMIC SUSTAINABILITY PLAN AS FAR AS WATER ALL THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE CSU. FOR THE COMING YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THEN LET ME JUST ASK A QUESTION KIND OF IN LINE WITH THIS BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T DISSIPATE THIS MIGHT COME UP AGAIN IN THE NEXT PANEL. BUT ON PAGE TWENTY A OF THE AUDIT REPORT MENTIONS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION. CS USE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION RESERVE AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. WAS NEEDED TO PAY FOR EXPENSES TIED TO EXISTING CONTRACTS. YOU KNOW THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IDENTIFIED AS OF THE END OF FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. HOW MUCH FUNDING WAS TIED TO HIS EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE WAS ENCUMBERED. IT WAS ABOUT NINETY FIVE MILLION IS ABOUT NINETY FIVE MILLION OF THE ONE POINT FIVE DOES CRACKS. OKAY AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE RELEVANT FOR THE NEXT PANEL BECAUSE- WAS IT ENCUMBERED WASN'T NOT YOU'RE SAYING OF THE ONE POINT FIVE ONLY NINETY FIVE MILLION LESS YEAH I WAS IS AND OUR ACCOUNTS WHERE IT'S BASICALLY TIED TO EITHER EXISTING CONTRACT. EXISTING CONTRACTS BASICALLY OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE CLARITY RIGHT AT THE TIME WHEN WE ASK THERE'S- ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR MR TING. SORRY ONE ONE LAST QUESTION. HE'S JUST TO JUST TO KIND OF FOLLOW UP IN YOUR- A REPORT ON FORTY EIGHT YOU BREAK OUT THE FOUR. BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS DID YOU BREAK UP THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION ANYWHERE. IT JUST IT JUST TO CLARIFY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO FOR THE PUBLIC IF MY COLLEAGUES. THAT THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IS THE RESERVES OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES IS THAT CORRECTAS YOU CAN SEE AND THERE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVE FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE RIGHT INTO SO WHEN WE DID THE WOULDN'T MISS MCCARTY AND I REQUEST OF THE UC OPR IT WAS ONLY. THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT DID NOT INCLUDE THE OTHER TEN CAMPUSES SO THE THAT'S WHY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IS VERY DIFFERENT THAT'S CORRECT NOW NOW IS THERE ANY PLACE WHERE YOU BROKE OUT. THE ONE POINT FIVE. BY CAMPUS. I WOULD YET BREAK OUT THE LOWER FORTY FIVE IN THE REPORT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT CAMPUSES INCLUDED TO REPORTS THE CHANCES OFFICE WEST PART OF THEIR TO BE SERVICE BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN THE REPORT IS A WAY TO GET THE TOOLS. THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION WE CAN GET THAT TO YOU IN A BIT BASED ON THAT YOU HAVE A SENSE OF DUTY COULD I ASSUME THAT THE ONE POINT FIVE BREAKS OUT IN SIMILAR FASHION AS TO THE FOUR WAS THERE HI I AYE DADDY FORESHADOWED CALL MAYBE WE COULD HAVE GET YOU THAT INFORMATION SIR TANK STATE HOUSING FOR THE ONLY. TIME AND HAVE AS I MENTIONED DOES SPENDING SOME TIME ON THAT FISCAL TRANSPARENCY WEBSITE LAST WEEK AND SO I CAN GIVE YOU SOME OF THE BREAK OUT WE CAN GET THIS TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF. OF THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IS THIS RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND THEN YOU HAVE THE NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT FOR ENCUMBRANCES THESE ARE PURCHASE ORDERS OF CONTRACTS THAT WERE ENTERED INTO TOWARD THE END OF ONE FISCAL YEAR AND HAVE TO BE PAID TO FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR. HE ALSO HAVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN WHAT CSU CALLS OPEN COMMITMENTS WHICH ARE QUITE INCOME AND SCISSORS NOT ACTUALLY CONTRACTS SIGNED BE SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT WITH FACULTY AND OR OTHERS TO GIVE THEM SOME MONEY. DO IN THE IN THE NEXT YEAR. YOU ALSO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF MONEY FOR ABOUT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY AND FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT SO CAMPUSES ARE NOW ENCOURAGED TO SAVE MONEY AND PUT IT TOWARD A BIG PROJECT THAT THEY'RE DOING. SO IF THEY'RE DOING A RENOVATION HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS RED HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR RAISE IT RENOVATION OF THE PROJECT THE BUILDING THEY'RE ENCOURAGED TO PUT 410% AND SO THEY'LL SAY FOR THAT SO WE CAN GET YOU THE BREAK OUT THERE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE BIG BUCKETS ARE THESE KIND OF INCOME AND DESERVE COMMITMENTS CAPITAL OUTLAY AND RESERVES RECKON ON THE CONCERT RIGHT SO DID YOU JUST SO I THINK WERE A WE'RE TALKING OPTION ORANGES HERE. IN THE LEGISLATIVE CONTEXT WE TALK ABOUT. OUR RESERVE OUR STATE RESERVE NOTED THAT MONIES ENCUMBERED. IS THAT CORRECT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR- ALMOST EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OF RESERVE NOT THAT'S THAT'S I DON'T COVERED MONEY. I BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT THAT WE CAN GET BACK TO RIGHT SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MONEY THAT'S ENCUMBERED IN NOT ENCUMBERED IN THIS QUOTE UNQUOTE RESERVE CONTEXT. THEY THEY ARE DIFFERENT ISSUES AND IF WE LOOK AT THAT FROM OUR STATE POINT OF VIEW WE WOULD HAVE TO. PERHAPS YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT SB ONE MONEY IN RESERVE FOR OTHER MONEY IN RESERVE THAT'S ALSO STORE SPECIAL FAR I MEAN I THINK I THINK WE- CALL A LOT OF THAT SPECIAL FUNDS. BECAUSE IT COMES WITH DIFFERENT SOURCE COAST STATES ALREADY SPECIFIED AS TO WHERE THAT IS APPROPRIATE. SO I THINK I DO WANT TO BE. CAREFUL JUST UNDERSTAND. THE LANGUAGE IS BEING USED BECAUSE IN OUR LEGISLATIVE CONTEXT IS DIFFERENT IS NOT. RIGHT MISTER CHANG AND THAT'S WHY WHEN WE REFER WE HAVE A FIGURE IN THE REPORT THAT TALKS ABOUT A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS BUT THERE IS TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS SIMILAR TO SB ONE MONEY IT'S SPECIFICALLY. FOR IT IT'S RESTRICTED FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE YOU CAN'T USE THAT FOR OPERATIONS YOU HAVE TO USE IT FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE STUDENTS PAID LIKE STUDENT HOUSING OR A STUDENT CENTER. ON A CAMPUS SO THE DISTINCTION YOU'RE RIGHT BUT THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WE WOULD BE ABLE TO A CERTAINLY LA AS YOUR AS YOUR BUDGET EXPERTS WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE ONE POINT FIVE. GREAT AND I THINK WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE ALL THE GREAT WORK YOU'VE DONE AS ALWAYS I THINK JUST TREVECCA MY COLLEAGUES IN JUST ECHO ARE ARE WHICH IS A TWO CHAIR. AGAIN IN ALL THE HEARINGS THAT HAVE. BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD AND I USED TO SIT ON THAT BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. THERE WAS NEVER A TIME WHERE. HE WAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT I THINK THAT IS THE CONCERNING PART I THINK GOT AFTER CONVERSATIONS DIRECTLY WITH THE CHANCE I THINK I WILL BE REMEDY. MOVING FORWARD. AND I THINK JUST TO SHOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AUDITING THE IMPORTANCE OF FRANKLY BRINGING. THESE TYPES OF ISSUE FORWARD IN RESPONSE. THE UNIVERSITY REALLY IMPROVED THEIR WEBSITES IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR WEBSITE. IT IS A MUCH MUCH BETTER WEBSITE. VERY EASY TO USE EASY TO FIND I THINK AND I SO I THINK THAT. WE CURRENTLY ARE SEEN THANKFULLY CONCRETE STEPS. COME OUT OF THIS REQUEST MY COLLEAGUES QUIRK SILVA. AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE'RE ALL AFTER WE'RE AFTER BETTER TRANSPARENCY MORE INFORMATION. AND TO ME THAT THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS MANY OF THE CSU EMPLOYEES IN THE STUDENTS CAN REALLY. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT INFORMATION SO THAT THEY FEEL. THEY HAVE ACCESS TO SEE THE UNDERSTAND AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO. YOU KNOW ASK IN ORDER TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEY DON'T HAVE TO. IN A HIGHER TO COUNT TO GO DO THAT BUT THEY THEMSELVES CAN DO LIKE THAT. THIS IS A PUBLIC MONEY TO PUBLIC INSTITUTION. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. THE UNIVERSITY IS TAKING THE STEPS TO MAKE SURE. THAT THIS INFORMATION IS MUCH MORE CLEAR AND CONCISE. THANK YOU. THANK RESTING ALRIGHT WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT EXHAUSTIVE THE ALMOST AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR FIRST PANEL WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OUR SECOND PANEL AND BELIEVE WE MIGHT HAVE ENOUGH ROOM AT THE TABLE. SO OKAY WITH THAT LET'S GO TO CALL UP THE NEXT PANEL. THIS IS COMMENTS AND RESPONSES ON THE AUDIT. WE HAVE WITH US MISTER TIMOTHY WHITE THE CHANCELLOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY MISTER JACK RUN QUERY TRUSTEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE. UNIVERSITY BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND MYSTERIES PENALIZED FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND FOR. STICKING IT OUT WITH US HERE. WHEN YOU ARE READY TO BEGIN MISTER WHITE WE WILL PROCEED FOR THE RECORD. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN TELL US THE NUMBER SO MY NAME IS TIM WHITE I'M A CHANCE OR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY I'M GONNA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY. I WANT TO BEGIN BY EMPHASIZING THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY VALUES AND TAKES TO HEART. RECOMMENDATIONS OF OBJECTIVE AUDITS. WITH A. B. FROM OUR OWN AUDIT DIVISION OR FROM A BONAFIDE OUTSIDE AUDITOR OR FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. THEY ARE INDEED A STRATEGIC TOOL TO HELP MAKE A STRONGER. AS AN INSTITUTION AND TO PROVIDE FULL ACCOUNTABILITY TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND BUILD THEIR CONFIDENCE. THE STATE DAUGHTER THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT CONTAINS A NUMBER OF HELPFUL FINDINGS AND OFFERS INSIGHTFUL RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING FUNDS DEPOSITED AS REQUIRED BY STATUTE. IN STATE TRUST ACCOUNTS AND HELD OUTSIDE OF THE STATE TREASURY. AS WELL AS PARKING AND ALTER TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS AT FOUR OF OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR. WE AGREE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS SET FORTH IN THE AUDIT REPORT. IN FACT WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED WORK GROUPS TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED IN A TIMELY FASHION. INCLUDING MORE GRANULAR PRESENTATIONS OF OUR RESERVES. HOWEVER IN THIS CASE TO SENSATIONALIZE HEADLINE IN AN ACCURATE LANGUAGE IN THE REPORT MISS CHARACTERIZE THE NATURE OF CAL STATES DESIGNATED RESERVE FUNDS DESCRIBING RESERVES AS A QUOTE DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS. THIS IMPLIES THAT THE FUNDS ARE EXTRA MONEY THAT COULD BE PUT TO ANY USE INCLUDING REGULAR ONGOING. OPERATIONS OR THAT THEY WERE IN FACT A NEEDED. MORE TROUBLING THE REPORT SUGGESTS THAT WE WERE NOT OPEN ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND FAILED TO FULLY DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RESERVE FUNDS TO YOU THE LEGISLATORS OTHER STATE OFFICIALS INTO OUR STUDENTS. THESE ASSERTIONS ARE INCORRECT. ANYTHING BUT DISCRETIONARY ARE DOESN'T NEED RESERVE SERVE THREE SPECIFIC AND CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. FIRST IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE MILLION WAS AVAILABLE TO FULFILL SHORT TERM FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS INCLUDING FRONTING FINANCIAL AID FOR OUR STUDENTS. AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH TERM THE CSU ADVANCES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO STUDENTS TO ENSURE THEIR FINANCIAL AID PACKAGES ARE COMPLETE. WE ARE LATER REPAID BY THE STATE AND BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S. SECOND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION IN RESERVES WERE AVAILABLE TO FUND CAPITAL PROJECTS. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN A LAW CHANGE TRANSFERRED FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE PROJECTS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. AT THAT TIME WE DIRECTLY CAMPUSES TO SAY FUNDS DESIGNATED AS RESERVES TO FUND A PORTION OF THE COST OF THOSE PROJECTS TO MODERNIZE AGING CAMPUS FACILITIES OR BUILD NEW ONES. AND THE THIRD FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS RESERVE FUNDS WERE AVAILABLE TO MITIGATE AGAINST AN ECONOMIC DINE DOWNTURN. THAT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION IS LESS THAN ONE MONTH OF OUR ANNUAL OPERATING EXPENSES. IN THIS RESERVE IS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN CALIFORNIA'S WELL REGARDED FUNDS FOR RESERVE. THIS YEAR'S YOU HAS BEEN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE RESERVE FUND THROUGH DOZENS OF DOCUMENTS AND PRESENTATIONS SERVICE STATE OFFICIALS. ARE BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN OUR STUDENTS. TO SUPPORT HIS POSITION THAT WE FAILED TO FULLY DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT IS DESIGNATED RESERVES THE AUDIT REPORT POINTS TO SPECIFIC REPORTS WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE ANY ANALYSIS OF THESE RESERVES. THE FIRST IS AN ANNUAL TUITION PROPOSAL SENT TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE WORKING FAMILY TRANSPARENCY ACT. THE SECOND IS A DOCUMENT CALLED THE ACADEMIC SUSTAINABILITY PLAN WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THIS IS AFTERNOON REQUIRED BY THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BUDGET ACT. THIS IS DAN ABILITY PLAN FORECAST FUTURE CSU ENROLLMENT TRENDS AND OTHER PERFORMANCE MEASURES. BOTH OF THESE DOCUMENTS FOCUSED ON ONGOING BASED BUDGET OPERATING ASSUMPTIONS NEITHER WERE INTENDED OR REQUIRED TO CONSIDER THE USE OF ONE TIME DESIGNATED RESERVES TO FUND ONGOING YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT ACTIVITIES THAT IS THE REASON AND THE ONLY REASON WHY THESE DOCUMENTS DID NOT INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS. OF DESIGNATED RESERVE FUNDS. HOWEVER MOVING FORWARD AND IN THE SPIRIT OF FULLY IMPLEMENTING THE AUDIT REPORTS RECOMMENDATIONS WE WILL INCORPORATEIN ALL BUDGET INTUITION RELATED DOCUMENTATION A DESCRIPTION OF A ONE TIME DESIGNATED RESERVES CLARIFYING WHAT THEY ARE USED FOR AND WHAT THE ARE NOT USED FOR AN EMPHASIZING THE USE OF SUCH A ONE TIME FUNDS FOR ONGOING EXPENSES. IS NOT FISCALLY PRUDENT. NOW REGRETTABLY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE AUDIT REPORTS PUBLICATION IT'S SENSATIONALIZED LANGUAGE PREDICTABLY WAS AMPLIFIED IN DISTORTED IN EXTENSIVE STATEWIDE MEDIA COVERAGE THESE INFLAMMATORY ARTICLES REPORTS MISLED AND CONFUSE THE PUBLIC IN SUCH A WAY THAT RISKED UNFAIRLY TARNISHING THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY REPUTATION TO THE DETRIMENT OF ITS FACULTY AND STAFF AND IS MORE THAN FOUR MILLION STUDENTS AND ALUMNI. INTO THAT. I HAVE TAKEN IN CAN TAKE GREAT UMBRAGE IS WHY I HAVE AND WILL ONTINUE TO STAND UP FOR THIS REVERED INSTITUTION IS PROUD COMMUNITY OF STUDENTS ALUMNI FACULTY STAFF BOTH PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE. AND IT IS WHY I AM SO APPRECIATIVE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY TO CLARIFY THE RECORD FOR YOU AND FOR ALL THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES STAKEHOLDERS. WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONFIRMING THAT WE HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE. DILIGENT AND RESPONSIBLE STEWARDS OF THE RESOURCES ENTRUSTED TO US AND CAPABLE AND TRUSTED PARTNERS OF HE STATE IN THE EXECUTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL MISSION. I NOW TURN IT OVER TO SEE ISSUE TRUSTEE JACK MCGRORY FOR HIS OPENING REMARKS JACK THANK YOU MISS REGARD. AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS JACK MEMORY AND IT'S AN HONOR PRIVILEGE IN A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY TO SERVE ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. I AM NOT SURE THE BOARDS COMMITTEE ON AUDIT AND THE VICE CHAIR OF ITS COMMITTEE ON FINANCE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND GENERALLY PLEASED AT THE AUDIT REPORTS SPECIFIC FINDINGS. I SERVE THE CITY MANAGER OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO DURING THE NINETEEN NINETIES DURING A FIVE YEAR RECESSION AND I CAN TELL YOU. BASED ON MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE MAINTAINING ADEQUATE RESERVES IS MORE THAN A BEST PRACTICE. IS AN ESSENTIAL FISCAL PRACTICE. HISTORY HAS SHOWN US THAT SO OFTEN CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS MUNICIPALITIES. THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL CRISES OR EVEN BANKRUPTCY ARE THOSE THAT HAVE NOT HAD A PROPER RESERVE POLICY TO MITIGATE. AGAINST EMERGENCIES ARE ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. I SEE THIS AUDIT REPORTS DEMONSTRATING THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY HAS APPROVED RESERVE POLICY IN PLACE AND IT TO RESERVE FUNDS ARE BEING PROPERLY USED. I DO AGREE WITH THE STATE AUDITOR THEN IT'S TIME WE RE RE VISIT OUR RESERVE POLICY. AN ESSENTIAL WHITE NOTED THE AUDIT REPORT OFFERS MUCH HELPFUL GUIDANCE IN THIS REGARD. I'VE BEEN CARDS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE STAFF IN THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO EMBRACE THE RICH REPORTS RECOMMENDATIONS. OUR SYSTEM WILL BE STRONGER FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION. NOW PLEASE WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN STEPS TO ENSURE THAT WE WILL DO SO IN A TIMELY MANNER. HOWEVER I WELL I'M SUPPORTIVE OF MANY OF THE AUTO REPORTS SPECIFIC FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS I LIKE CHANCEL WIDE. TAKE ISSUE WITH THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CS USE DESIGNATED RESERVE FUNDS AS DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS YOU CAN GO TO THAT WEBSITE AND YOU WILL FIND A SPECIFIC DESIGNATED PURPOSE FOR ALL OF THOSE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR RESERVES. THEY'RE NOT TO THE COUNTRY THEY SERVE SPECIFIC AN ESSENTIAL PURPOSES FURTHER THAN SENSATIONALIZE LANGUAGE THROUGHOUT THE REPORT BEST EXAMPLE FIGHT IN ITS TITLE WE SEIZE UPON BY THE MEDIA THESE ARE NOT DISCRETIONARY SURPLUSES THESE ARE IMPORTANT REQUIRED RESERVES THAT WE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE PHYSICAL INTEGRITY. OF OUR SYSTEM. MANY MANY OF THE MEDIA REPORTS REFERRED TO US AS HAVING HIDDEN THE BALL WITH RESPECT TO THESE RESERVES IS RESERVE RESERVES HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED THEIR IN EVERY ANNUAL AUDITED STATEMENT. AND THEY'VE BEEN DISCUSS WITH THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD CAREFULLY REVIEWED ALL THE INFORMATION DOCUMENTATION AND PRESENTATIONS REGARDING RESERVES. IS MY FIRM BELIEF THAT THE CSU HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF FULLY TRANSPARENT AND OPEN ABOUT ITS RESERVE POLICY. IN APPRECIATIVE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO CONFIRM THIS FOR ALL THE UNIVERSITIES STAKEHOLDERS. AND I JUST WANNA SAY A COUPLE THINGS WE TALK A LOT ABOUT TUITION INCREASES AND IT SOUNDS LIKE WE THE TRUSTEES HAVE BEEN INCREASING TUITION ON A REGULAR BASIS. THERE'S BEEN ONE TUITION INCREASE IN THE PAST EIGHT YEARS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESERVES FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE AND YOU LOOK AT THE RAINY DAY PART OF THOSE RESERVES. THAT IS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S THREE WEEKS WORTH OF OPERATING REVENUE. MOST PEOPLE WOULD TELL YOU RATING AGENCIES AND OTHER FISCAL EXPERTS THAT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. WE SHOULD HAVE A LARGER EMERGENCY RESERVE. I SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT MY SENTIMENTS ARE SHARED BY THE OTHER TRUSTEES. IN A CHAIRMAN ADAM DAY WHO ARE FULLY AWARE IN SUPPORT OF THE CS USERS ARE POLICY. I BELIEVE CHAIRMAN DAYS SHOULD A LETTER TO THIS EFFECT. I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE I KNOW TURN OVER CHANCELLOR WHITE WHO HAS A FEW ADDITIONAL OPENING REMARKS. PLEASE WAS RIGHT. I WISH TO ELABORATE FOR JUST A MOMENT ON TO THE AUTO REPORTS OVER WRITING SEEMS AND TO THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP EARLIER ON. CHEERS AND SALAS. THE TWO WATER REPORT SEEMS WHILE NOT UNTRUTHFUL. WE'RE SIGNIFICANTLY MISLEADING AND WHICH HAVE BEEN FURTHER DISTORTED AND EXAGGERATED IN THE MEDIA. THE FIRST IS THE NOTION THAT WE WERE ACCUMULATING AN ENORMOUS SURPLUS WHILE NEARLY DOUBLING TUITION DURING THE AUDIT PERIOD. LET ME ADDRESS TUITION FIRST. DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND I HAVE NO IDEA ALLOW REFER TO IT AS A GREAT RECESSION I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WAS GREAT FOR. BUT DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME THE CSU LOS MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF STATE FUNDING. IN FACT AT ONE POINT WE LOST ALMOST ONE THIRD% OF OUR STATE APPROPRIATION IN JUST A MATTER OF MONTHS. NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN A MATTER OF MONTHS FROM A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION OF TWO POINT NINE SEVEN ONE DOWN TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS. TO PARTIALLY MITIGATE THAT DRAMATIC LOSS OF STATE FUNDS CSU WAS FORCED TO INSTITUTE CAN PERCENTAGE INCREASES TO OUR TUITION AND RECOVERED TWO THIRDS ONLY OF THAT LOSS AND WE CUT EXPENSES. BUT SINCE THAT TIME OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST EIGHT YEARS AS TRUSTEE MCGRORY JUST SAID WE HAVE INCREASED TUITION ONLY ONCE BY TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WHEN WE DID NOT RECEIVE THE EXPECTED IN NEEDED STATE APPROPRIATION. AND THAT REVENUE WAS ALL DIRECTED THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE EARLY RESULTS OF WHICH ARE SHOWING INITIATIVE TO BE OF A TRANSFORMATIVE BENEFIT. TO OUR STUDENTS INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE ALSO GRATEFUL THAT OUR STATE APPROPRIATION. COME TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN HAS RETURNED TO THE PRE RECESSION LEVELS AND TODAY WE SERVE FORTY ONE THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS AND TEN YEARS AGO. DURING THIS TIME FRAME THAT IS THE SCOPE OF THIS AUDIT AND LARGELY IN RESPONSE TO THE LESSONS OF THE RECESSION WE DILIGENTLY SAYS SIDE FUNDS IN RESERVE TO PROTECT AGAINST THE NEXT INEVITABLE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. ARE RESERVED FOR BUILT AND THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A MOMENT AT A RATE OF LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. OF OUR ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGET A MODEST GROWTH ON A PERCENT OF BUDGET BASIS. THE IMPLICATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN HOARDING MONEY WHILE REPEATEDLY RAISING TUITION IS FUNDAMENTALLY MISLEADING. SO WHERE DID THE RESERVE FUND COME FROM REALLY ONLY TWO WAYS FIRST THEY COME FROM THE RETURNS ARE ON OUR INVESTMENTS MANAGED EXPERTLY BY OUR INVESTMENT COMMITTEE. AND SECOND WE GET THEM BY EXPENDITURE SAVINGS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THETWO HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN LAW THAT SHIFTED FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FROM CAPITAL PROJECTS FROM THE STATE TO THE CSU AT THAT TIME WE INSTRUCTED OUR CAMPUSES TO BEGIN TO SET ASIDE RESERVE FUNDS TO COVER A PORTION OF THOSE PROJECTS TO MODERNIZE AGING BUILDINGS ARE. BUILDING FACILITIES. AND AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR WHEN THERE'S A SAVINGS IN OPERATING COSTS WE HAVE BUDGET IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY AND HAVE SPENT LESS WE PUT THAT SAVINGS INTO SPECIFIC DESIGNATED RESERVES. THOSE ARE THE SOURCES OF OUR RESERVE FUNDS. THIS LEADS ME THEN TO ANOTHER IMPLICATION THAT I FIND FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR. AND WE'VE BEEN USING TUITION DOLLARS TO FUND OUR RESERVES. IT'S ANOTHER NOTION THAT WHILE NOT UNTRUTHFUL IS PROFOUNDLY MISLEADING HERE'S WHY. FIRST THE AUDIT REPORT ONLY FOCUSED ON STATE TRUST FUNDS HELD OUTSIDE THE STATE TREASURY. THERE IS NO STATE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION IN TRUST FUNDS. IN FURTHER AS REQUIRED BY LAW IN THE BUDGET ACT TO MEET OUR OPERATING COSTS WE SPEND NO MORE THAN ONE TWELFTH OF OUR GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION EACH MONTH FOR THE FIRST TEN MONTHS OF THE FISCAL YEAR. AND THEN SPEND THE BALANCE OF OUR STATE ALLOCATION EVERY MAY. WE USED TO OCEAN DOLLARS EVERY MONTH AS WELL. SO AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR IN JUNE WE'VE SPENT DOWN A 100% OF OUR STATE APPROPRIATION AND MOST BUT NOT ALL OF OUR TUITION DOLLARS. ANYTHING THAT'S LEFT IN THE UNSPENT MONEYS RISE I MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO WE DESIGNATE AS RESERVES THEY ARE BOUND TO BE TUITION DOLLARS OR THE INTEREST EARNINGS. OUR FINANCIAL OPERATIONS MANY OF WHICH ARE STATUTORILY MANDATED INSURER THAT ANY OPERATIONAL FUNDS THAT ARE NOT SPENT AT THE END OF THE YEAR CAN ONLY COME FROM TUITION OR INTEREST. THE AUTO REPORTS IMPLICATION THAT WE DISPROPORTIONATELY USED OUR TUITION DOLLARS TO BUILD OUR RESERVES IS THEREFORE MISLEADING. YOUR SALAS YOU RAISE THAT MANY MEMBERS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAN DIEGO STATE PARKING SITUATION. SEND YOU THE STATE INCREASED PARKING RATES THE QUESTION IS TO THE INCREASE PART WAYS TO BUILD A PARKING STRUCTURE FOR RETAIL DEVELOPMENT. THE ANSWER IS NO. A STUDENT PARKING RATES WERE NOT INCREASED TO BUILDER FINANCES PARKING STRUCTURE. THE PARKING STRUCTURE OF WAS BUILT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE FEES WERE INCREASED IN PARKING IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHICH IS THE FIRST INCREASE HE DONE IN TEN YEARS. GROCERY FOOD AND RETAIL CUSTOMERS AND CAMPUS VISITORS. HOURLY PARKING FEES IT FULLY FINANCE AT PARKING FACILITY THERE'S NOT ANY STUDENT PARKING FEE MONEY FINANCING IN. UNIVERSITY FINANCE THE PROGRAM WITH THE HOURLY RATES PAY FOR. AND IS THE TIES IN WITH THE CONCERTED EFFORT TO INCREASE ON CAMPUS STUDENT HOUSING AND SAN DIEGO. AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY HE ASKED THE QUESTION DO WE USE THE RESERVES AT ALL IN THE LAST RECESSION YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WINDOW OF THE AUDIT. IT STARTS RIGHT AFTER THE RECESSION HIT. SO THE WINDOW OF THE AUDIT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE- NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION IN OUR STATE APPROPRIATION. NOR DOES IT INCLUDE THE FACT WE SPENT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE YEAR FROM USERS RIDGE REDUCING A RESERVE BALANCES FROM SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR MILLION THEN. DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX. SO THEY WERE USED DURING THAT RECESSION. AND THEY HELPED TRANSITION CAMPUSES DURING THAT TIME WHEN WE LOST THAT NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AND IT ALSO RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN SERVICING COURSES FOR STUDENTS. AND REGRETTABLY FURLOUGHS FOR ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES WERE FULLY IMPLEMENTED. AND THEN AFTER THAT PERIOD OF TIME WE STARTED TO SYSTEMATICALLY GROW OUR RESEARCH BACK UP. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE FUTURE. SO ANY CLOSE BY SAYING THAT WE APPRECIATED AGREE WITH MANY OF THE AUDIT REPORT FINDINGS AT THE CSU COMMITS TO IMPLEMENTING AND HEARING TO EACH OF THE REPORT'S RECOMMENDATIONS. I ALSO COMMIT TO THE FOLLOWING. THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY DID NOT AND DOES NOT HIDE MONEY A RESERVE POLICIES IMPORTANT IN FACT IT IS ESSENTIAL IN IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR STUDENTS ARE EMPLOYEES ARE FACULTY AND STAFF IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS WILL MOVE TO THIS PAYING AND THEN WILL OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND FOR GIVING CSU STUDENTS A SEAT AT THE TABLE AS WE DISCUSSED THE STATE WATER REPORT. MY NAME IS GRACE PAYING AND I'M A SOPHOMORE AT SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY. THIS YEAR I'M SERVING AS A CAL STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATIONS A VICE PRESIDENT OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS. AND MY ROLE I AM TASKED WITH AMPLIFYING THE NEEDS AND CONCERNS OF OUR HALF A MILLION CSU STUDENTS. I BALANCE THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS RESPONSIBILITY SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH OTHER NORMAL COLLEGE STUDENT THINGS LIKE MY MENTAL HEALTH. MY ACADEMIC RETENTION. IN MY FINANCIAL BURDENS FROM THE COST OF COLLEGE ATTENDANCE. TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER THE STUDENT PERSPECTIVE. ON THE AUDIT AS WELL AS GIVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COURSES OF ACTION MOVING FORWARD. I'D FIRST LIKE TO COMMEND THE CSU FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO COMMUNICATION WITH STUDENT LEADERS MOVING FORWARD. FOLLOWING THE AUDIT WE HAVE HAD THREE MEETINGS FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE REGARDING OUR CONCERNS AND GAPS IN INFORMATION. I WOULD LIKE TO ESPECIALLY THANK VICE CHANCELLOR RALLY EIGHT FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO MAKING THE CSU BUDGET MORE DIGESTIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS MOVING FORWARD. PER OUR LAST MEETING I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON REFORMING THE TRANSPARENCY. PORTAL AND POTENTIALLY THE RESERVES POLICY. BUT LET'S BE REAL. A MAJORITY OF CSUSTUDENTS HAVE NOT HEARD ABOUT THE FINDINGS OF THE STATE AUDIT. AND FOR THOSE WHO HAVE READ IT IT IS STILL REALLY HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH WHEN YOU'VE BEEN. WHEN YOU'VE HEARD TWO VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES THE CSU HAS DEFENDED THEIR RESERVE THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT OFFICE REPORTS IT AS A SURPLUS IN THE FOLLOWING AND A FOLLOW UP MEETING WITH VICE CHANCELLOR RALLY A WHEN ASKED OF THIS YEAR'S YOU COULD SHOW US WHERE IN LAST YEAR'S FINANCIAL STATEMENT. IS THE RESERVE SLASH SURPLUS DISCLOSED THE LINE ITEM IS LABELED AS INVESTMENTS. SO WHILE THERE'S BEEN GREAT DEBATE BETWEEN THE TWO STAKEHOLDERS OVER WHAT TO CALL THESE FUNDS. I THINK WE CAN ALL DO A BETTER JOB AT ENGAGING THE MOST IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDER OF ALL. WHICH OUR STUDENTS. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ALLEGED MISMANAGEMENT OR NON DISCLOSURE OF DIRECT STUDENT DOLLARS. THE TRUTH SHOULD NOT BE THIS HARD TO PURSUE. AS A REPRESENTATIVE FOR CSU STUDENTS I SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE SYSTEM AND HAVING A RESERVE AS PART OF THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTY. THE MAIN CONCERN FROM STUDENTS IS NOT THAT THE CSU HAS A RESERVE. BUT IT'S THAT WE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT IT AND WE STILL CONTINUE TO HAVE GAPS IN INFORMATION. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE DID NOT DISCLOSE THE RESERVES TO STUDENTS WHEN PROPOSING TUITION INCREASES. EVEN THOUGH THE BEEN MANDATED BY LAW TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH INFORMATION ABOUT. ALTERNATIVES TO RAISING TUITION SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE INPUT AND ASK QUESTIONS. THIS IS PROBLEMATIC ESPECIALLY BECAUSE TUITION DOLLARS DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO RESERVE. ONE OF OUR BIGGEST GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE INCLUDE NOT KNOWING WHAT THE ROLE THAT TUITION PLAYS AND REACHING THE CS USE GOALS FOR A LARGER RESERVE. I SPENT THE PAST FEW WEEKS TRYING TO SIFT THROUGH THE DIFFERENT INFORMATION BEING GIVEN TO STUDENTS BUT ALSO GAUGING HOW STUDENTS HAVE BEEN FEELING ABOUT THE AUDIT. I ACTUALLY JUST CAME FROM US CAL STATE FULLERTON FOR MARCY S. UNITY CONFERENCE COMPRISING A STUDENT LEADERS ACROSS ALL OF OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES WHILE MANY STUDENTS CANNOT BE IT AN ATTENDANCE TODAY DUE TO WRAPPING UP OUR CONFERENCE. I GOT OVERWHELMING FEEDBACK REGARDING THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PARKING SIDE OF THE AUDIT SPECIFICALLY IT SEEMS LIKE THE PARKING DISCUSSION HAS NOT HAD THE FOCUS DESERVES IN COMPARISON TO THE RESERVE. SLASHER POSSIBLY DEBATE. DISCUSSING THE COSTA STUDENT PARKING AND HOW IT AFFECTS COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY I WOULD LIKE TO CHALLENGE WITH THE SYSTEM AND THE STATE TO DO BETTER. BECAUSE A SEEMINGLY LOWER EXPENSE MEANS 20% OF THE MONTHLY PAYCHECK FOR YOUR SALAS ARE AS CAL STATE LA STUDENT. I MEAN STUDENTS LIKE OF JANA JOHNSON FROM CSU CHANNEL ISLANDS HOW TO CUMULATE MANY TICKETS LAST YEAR FROM HAVING TO PRIORITIZE OTHER COSTS LIKE BOOKS AND FOOD BEFORE PURCHASING A PERMIT. AND ACCORDING TO THE AUDIT FINDINGS FOUR OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE BUILT EXPENSIVE NEW PARKING FACILITIES THAT ONLY MINIMALLY% TO INCREASED PARKING CAPACITIES. THIS MEANS NOT ONLY STE NOT ONLY OUR STUDENTS HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BUYING YOUR TEXTBOOKS ARE PURCHASING A PERMIT. STUDENTS ARE ALSO PAYING FOR THE EXPENSIVE PERMITS JUST TO NOT BE ABLE TO FIND A SPOT OR MISS CLASSES DUE TO HOW LONG IT TAKES. I AM GLAD THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION I BEING ADOPTED BY THE CSU BUT THERE STILL REMAINS A GREAT IN EQUITY AND THE COST. OF PARKING ON CAMPUS. THE AUDIT FOUND THAT IN ALL FOUR CAMPUSES SURVEYED STUDENTS PAY SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FOR PARK AND THEN STAFF OR FACULTY. STUDENTS ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT NONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE AUDITOR DIRECTLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THE HIGH COST OF PARKING IS NOT JUST THE CAMPUS ISSUE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE DO NOT REQUIRE CAMPUSES TO PROVIDE REQUIRED INFORMATION BEFORE IT APPROVED FUNDING FOR NEW PARKING FACILITIES. AS A CHANCE IS OFFICE IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON PROPOSALS FOR TWO NEW PARKING STRUCTURES WE ECHO THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION TO UPDATE THEIR PARKING FACILITIES REQUEST POLICY AND MANDATE STUDENT REPRESENTATION ON ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEES. TO CLOSE OUT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR YOUR TIME AS WE ALL WORK TOWARDS MAKING THE CSU MORE ACCESSIBLE. AND MORE AFFORDABLE WE LOOK FOR TO FOLLOWING UP WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS FIGHTING FOR INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND STUDENT REPRESENTATION. AND WORKING WITH THE CSU AND THE STATE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND FREEWAYS AND FOR BEING HERE WITH THAT BEFORE WE OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS LET ME JUST ASK BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF BUDGET QUESTIONS IF WE HAVE MISS HOWELL AND PERHAPS. MR STAND HOUSE AND MAYBE BACK UP TO. UP TO THE TABLE HERE IS WE START ASKING SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS. BUT SO I HAVE A COUPLE EXPERTS HERE AS WELL BROWN WELLS OKAY IF WE COULD GET CHAIRMAN AND IS ROUGHLY HAVE ADDITIONAL CHAIRS BUT MAYBE AS QUESTIONS COME UP IF WE NEED TO BRING THEM UP WE WILL. PERFECT YEAH TO SWEETIE HAS PASSED A YEAH BECAUSE I KNOW THEY BOTH HAVE STAFF AS WELL BUT- IF WE NEED ADDITIONAL FOLKS WILL BRING THEM UP AS WELL. SO LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT MAYBE I'LL JUST KICK OFF. WELL ONCE OF CLARITY AROUND THE NUMBERS IN. THE WAR ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT SO CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN HOW. THE CAMPUSES AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. ACCUMULATE OPERATING FUND RESERVES. FOR EXAMPLE DO THE CAMPUSES CREATED A LINE ITEM IN THEIR ANNUAL EXPENDITURE BUDGET. SPECIFICALLY EARMARKED FOR RESERVES AND. MAYBE WHAT OTHER WAYS AS RESERVES ARE GENERATED. JUST SO IT'S VERY TRANSPARENT AND VERY CLEAR. WELL I GUESS THEY'RE BRED WELLS IS HERE ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE AS WE SET UP SOBRE ACCOUNTED HERE'S A TON OF ACCOUNTS WE KNOW THERE'S THESE RESERVES ARE. DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE SYSTEM THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE HELD IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR SOMEONE HELD A CHANCE OF OPERATE OFFICE. THEY GO OUT TO CAMPUS IS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU RECALL OF A FEW YEARS AGO WE RECEIVED A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR ENROLLMENT. ONE TIME MONEY WELL WE DISTRIBUTED TO A QUARTER OF THAT NOW ALMOST A HALF OF THAT. THE OTHER BALANCE SEARCH WITH US EVEN THOUGH. IT'S NOT OUR RESERVE FOR OPERATION TO RESERVE THAT WERE HOLDING FOR THE CAMPUSES. BUT OUT ON THE CAMPUS IS THEN OFTENTIMES RESERVES THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE HELD AT THE CAMPUS CENTRALLY FOR MOSTLY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND FOR THE- INEVITABLE. OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURN BUT THERE'S ALSO RESERVES HELD FIFTY DEAN LEVEL FOR PROJECTS. THAT COME. OUT TO THE COLLEGES AND CAMPUS SO THERE'S QUITE A LAB. BUT FOR OUR FINANCIAL PURPOSES THE ORGAN ROLLED UP TOGETHER KNOWS OF THE NUMBERS THAT LEAD UP TO THE- ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. OKAY ADDED I THINK ONE OF TRYING TO JUST UNDERSTAND IS LIKE HOW CAN WE SEE THOSE RESERVES WHAT THOSE AMOUNTS ARE I WAS LOOKING AT IT THAT YOU'RE MAY THIRTIETH LETTER TO THE STATE AUDITOR. WERE EVERYTHING WAS CLASSIFIED THAT THE RESERVES ARE USING THREE MAJOR WAYS WHICH YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT IN YOUR COMMENTS AS WELL WHICH WAS TO. MANAGE SHORT TERM OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE. AND THREE TO HELP INSURE THAT OPERATING COSTS CAN BE PAID DURING TOUGH ECONOMIC AND FISCAL. YEARS SKI JUST EXPLAIN HOW. EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES JUST CAN YOU EXPLAIN BECAUSE THEY SEEM VERY LIKE BROAD CATEGORIES I KNOW THEY ARE BROAD CATEGORIES AND DEAL WITH TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES IN VARYING SIZES OF OPERATING BUDGETS AND MATURITY OF TIME EIGHT THEY VERY FROM A YOUNG CAMPUS THAT HAS OPERATING RESERVES THAT ARE SMALL NUMERICALLY. US WE LOOK AT OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS THAT THE CAMPUS IS MADE THAT MAY BE A SHORT TERM OBLIGATION AND SOME ENCUMBRANCES IT MAY BE TRYING TO CREATE A NEW PROGRAM THAT REQUIRES UPFRONT INVESTMENTS ACADEMIC PROGRAM APART UPFRONT INVESTMENTS BEFORE THERE'S REVENUE GENERATED BY BY STUDENTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS COURSE THE FINANCIAL AID PIECES THERE AND ANTICIPATION FUTURE DEBT SERVICE ON THE- ON THE CAPITAL SIDE PROBABLY DIFF CAMPUS IS THE NEWER ONES HAVE LESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO TAKE CARE OF LIKE SAN MARCOS BRAIN RELATIVELY BRAND NEW CAMPUS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD. COMPARED TO SAY CHICO OR HUMBLED WHERE YOU KNOW THERE'S REALLY A LOT OF FIFTY SIX SO AGAIN THIS IS DONE AT A CAMPUS LEVEL BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THESE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES FROM ARCADIA DOWN TO SAN DIEGO OTHER DONE IN CONSULTATION OBVIOUSLY WITH THE CAMPUS PRESIDENT TO THE END OF THE DAY IS THE AUTHORITY AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL THREE AND OUR CFO INFIRMITIES THEY PUT TOGETHER PLEASE ALSO REVIEWED TO DISCUSS BY MY CFO STEVE REALLY WHO'S HERE. EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR THE CSU SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THE CAMPUS IS HER MANAGING THEIR THEIR RESERVE PROPERLY WE LOOK OVERSEE THEIR DEBT RATIOS ALL THAT MATTERS AND HOW WHEN WE GO OUT FOR BONDING AND SO FORTH ARE MONEY RECENT INTEREST RATE SO THERE'S A LOT OF OVERSIGHT OF THE CENTRAL OFFICE THERE'S A LOT OF VERY ABILITY BECAUSE WE PROVIDE DATA TANAMI WITH OVERSIGHT TO OUR CAMPUSES WE CAN GET MUCH MORE SPECIFIC IF YOU WANT BRED TO GET INTO JAZZ IF IT COUNTS BUT IT'S PRETTY NOT WANTING TO DO IS JUST TRY TO FIGURE OUT BASS LINE. THE TRACK OF HOW THEY'RE IDENTIFIED WHAT THOSE FUNDS ARE IF IT'S. FOR AFTER A WHILE A PROJECT OR FOR ANOTHER ITEM. OBSERVERS THEY'RE ENCUMBRANCES FOR CONTRACTS HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS CONTRACT REWARDED ENTERED INTO THAT WE HAVE TO PAY. STE SOME CAMPUSES WANT TO BUILD NEW FACILITIES I KNOW IS INVOLVED SAN DIEGO STATE WE BUILT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ENGINEERING COMPLEX. A THIRD OF IT CAME FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS A THIRD OF IT CAME FROM THIS FROM THE CSU AND A THIRD CAME FROM FLAT TO PRE. THE THIRD THE CAME THE CAMPUS THEY SAVE UP THE MONEY TO PUT IN THE CASH TO COVER THEIR THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR SIGN. THAT'S IN THESE NUMBERS. SO THAT IS NOT. THE RE A RESERVE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A MISNOMER. AND THE MONEY THEY CHIU APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR. ONE TIME MONEY FOR YOUR INCREASE ENROLLMENT. SITS IN A IN AN ACCOUNT THAT HAS A HUNDRED SIXTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS AND- THAT'S PART OF THESE NUMBERS. SO HOW WOULD YOU ACCOUNT BECAUSE EARLIER WE HEARD. ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. BELIEVE THE STATE AUDITOR'S. OFFICE SAID NINETY FIVE MILLION OF THAT WAS INCOME MURDER TIED TO CONTRACTS AND YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S MORE THAN THAT. WELL YOU YOUR YOUR APPROPRIATIONS FROM LAST YEAR TO FOR FURTHER FOR MOMENT SITS THERE BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE SPENT ONE TIME OVER FOUR YEARS. SO SITTING IN IN IN THIS IN AN ACCOUNT THAT IS IN THIS BROAD ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR CATEGORY. YOU REALLY HAVE TO GO ON TO THE WEBSITE AND BREAK IT BREAK IT THESE NUMBERS DONE THE REAL RAINY DAY RESERVE WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO YOUR RAINY DAY RESERVE. IS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THE REST OF IT IS AND WHAT'S CALLED DESIGNATED RESERVES. AND AGAIN FOR A MILLION DOLLARS IS THREE WEEKS WORTH OF OPERATING REVENUE WITH THAT THIS IS NOT. A HUGE RESERVE AND MOST PEOPLE SAYS UNDER ITS UNDER WHAT IT SHOULD BE. CORRECT AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE PEOPLE ARE HAVING SOME CONFUSION FOR THE CLARITY BECAUSE I HEARD THAT MISTER WHITE OF HIS COMMENTS SAY. LESSON ABOUT 1% LESS THAN RESERVE BUT THEN WHEN WE DID THE MATH IN THE EARLIER PANEL. IF YOU DO ONE POINT FIVE BASED ON ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WITH. THE YEARLY CSU ALLOCATION THAT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. SO THE TWENTY PERCENTERS AT 1% I THINK THAT'S WHERE WERE EVERYONE HAS. THESE QUESTIONS ON THE CLARITY AND WHAT THESE NUMBERS ACTUALLY. MEAN AND WHAT THEY MEAN TO THE PUBLIC ARE THESE. IS IT NINETY FIVE MILLION ONLY IN COVERED IS IT MORE BECAUSE IT'S- TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT. MAYBE THEY WERE BUDGET ACTIONS WE'VE SAID WE WANT TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HERE TODAY AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE. A LOT OF AB THE CONFUSING HEADLINES AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS COMING FROM AND WE'RE OPEN TO GET SOME CLARITY ON. I NOTICED RUDY HAS A QUESTION ON THIS VERY ISSUE. ON SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS. ACTUALLY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY. THE OTHER CAMPUSES THE TWENTY THREE CAPS IS THAT THE DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN THE- ONE POINT FIVE. WHERE DO YOU GET THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. OR OR OR IT ANOTHER WAY TO ASK THE SAME QUESTION THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES AND THE MANY. OF THE- HELD IN RESERVE OR ENCUMBERED IN THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES IT IS WHAT AMOUNT. OF THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. BECAUSE THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION INCLUDES MONEY. ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. INCLUDES THE MONEY ON THAT IN THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES CORRECT YES. AND IS THAT THE DIFFERENCE. THE FORTY MILLION IN OTHER WORDS I'M GOING BACK TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TINGS QUESTION AND OUT AND I WANT TO TRY TO. DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE CSU AND THE UC. AND DOCTOR WHITE SINCE YOU WERE IT UC RIVERSIDE. AND WE. VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SERVICE THERE AT UC ARE ARE THE ARE THE TWO SIS ISN'T DIFFERENT DO DOES UC. I HAVE. RESERVES ON THE CAMPUS LEVEL OR OR THE RESERVES IN THE UC ONLY AT THE PRESIDENT'S. OFFICE IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES AT THE TIME I WAS CHANCERY. A UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE WE HAD RESERVES ON CAMPUS. AS WELL AS THE RESERVES IN THE. IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE SAME IS TRUE AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY WE HAVE RESERVES HELD IN THIS CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE MY OFFICE. AND INNER RESERVES HELD ON THE CAMPUS IS A TWENTY IN THE RESERVES AND IN THE YOUR OFFICE AMOUNTS TO. SO THE RESERVE FOR OUR OPERATING COSTS AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. IS AROUND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS. BUT WE ALSO HOLD RESERVES FOR THE CAMPUS IS SORRY FOR EXAMPLE OF THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A ROMAN BOTH THE CAME IN ONE TIME FUNDING A YEAR OR SO AGO. WE HAVE BEEN HOLDING ABOUT NINETY MILLION OF THAT DISTRIBUTED OUT OF 20% THE FIRST YEAR ABOUT 25% THE SECOND YEAR TO THOSE RESERVES ARE HELD IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BUT THEY'RE NOT. HELD AGAINST OUR OPERATING COSTS THROUGH THE EARMARKED ALREADY FOR THE CAMPUS RIGHT. OUR ROUTE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS. OF OUR RESERVE THAT WE HOLD THIS FOR MY OPERATIONS ONLY. ABOUT A LITTLE LESS THAN TWENTY FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY TWENTY MILLION. ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR A CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT OF OUR FACILITY. WE AREGOING THROUGH A RENOVATION OF THIS BUILDING WHICH ISN'T FROM THE TWENTY. FIVE YEAR MARK SO PUTTING IN NEW ELEVATORS NEW H. FAQ AND LIGHTING AND SEISMIC ETCETERA. AND THEN WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY SIX MILLION IN SHORT TERM OBLIGATIONS. SO WE DON'T SIT ON A LARGE RESERVE AT ALL. FOR THE OPERATIONS. I DO WANT TO MAKE. GERMAN CELLS I THINK ONE OF THE CONFUSION CERTAIN. POINTS THAT MAKES THIS COMPLEX. IS. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE USE OF ONE TIME MONEY. VERSES A BASED BUDGET ON GOING RESOURCE AND SO WHEN THERE IS A RESERVE FUND IT'S ONE TIME MONEY LIKE A PIGGY BANK IF YOU STARTED IF YOU MADE A COMMITMENT ON THAT THAT WAS GONNA LAST AND PREFER TO LIKE. HIRING PERMANENT FACULTY. IN OUR SERVERS YOU CAN'T DO THAT ON ONE TIME RESERVES HI SO WE'VE HAD A PRETTY CLEAR PRACTICE. TO NOT USE ONE TIME MONEY. FOR ONGOING NEEDS OF THE UNIVERSITY. AND THE ONGOING NEED TO THE UNIVERSITY ARE SUPPORTED. VASTLY IN THE MAIN BY STATE ALLOCATION STATE APPROPRIATION GENERAL FUND CUT IN BY OUR TUITION DOLLARS NET TUITION DOLLARS AFTER FOR FINANCIALLY. THANK YOU DON'T APRECIATE THAT CLARITY AND LET ME JUST KIND OF PIGGY BACK OFF WHAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEDINA WAS. WAS SAYING BECAUSE LOOKING AT THE YACHT IT AND YOU KNOW PAGE FORTY EIGHT OF THE OUT OF REPORT. AND I SEE THAT THERE'S A SURPLUS BALLOTS FOR EACH CAMPUS BUT THEY VARY CONSIDERABLY ACROSS THE CAMPUSES. YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT CAMPS LIKE FRESNO STATE THE NINTH LARGEST CSU BUT HAS A SIXTEEN. LARGEST SURPLUS. SAN DIEGO STATED CONTRAST THE FOURTH LARGEST CSU CAMPUS. AS A LITTLE MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY RESERVES AS LIKE SAY CSU FULLERTON WHICH- NOW QUIRK SILVA WAS TALKING ABOUT AND LONG BEACH WHICH ARE THE SECOND AND THIRD LARGEST CAMPUSES. SORT OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE CRITERIA CSU USES FOR DETERMINING HOW LARGE ITS OVERALL RESERVE SHOULD BE. ALSO WHAT CRITERIA DOES YES YOU PROVIDE THE CAMPUSES TO HELP THEM DECIDE HOW MUCH TO MAINTAIN AND RESERVE. CONSIDERING THE VERY ABILITY BETWEEN. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. YEAH MY NAME IS BRAD WELLS I WORK A CHANCE OFFICE IN BUSINESS AND FINANCE THANK YOU THE TABLE YOU'RE REFERENCING ON PAGE FORTY EIGHT. I BELIEVE THE TOTAL CASH. BALANCE IS AT A POINT IN TIME SO I THINK WE OUGHT IT IS AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THOSE WITH THE CASH BALANCES. FOR ALL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY. THAT WOULD INCLUDE HOUSING MONIES PARKING MONEY STUDENT UNION MONIES. WHAT THE AUDITOR'S DESCRIBED BUT THE AUDIT REPORT IS DESCRIBED AS RESTRICTED FUNDS IN ADDITION IT INCLUDES THE- RESERVE OUT THAT WERE DESCRIBING HERE EARLIER IS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION SO THAT'S THE TOTAL POT. THE REASON IS DIFFERENT SO DIFFERENT BY CAMPUSES BECAUSE CAMPUSES ARE QUITE DIFFERENT THE SMALLEST CAMPUS WE HAS HAVE HAS AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF FORTY SEVEN MILLION. THE LARGEST BUDGET WE HAPPENED LARGEST CAMPUS WE HAVE HAS AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION. TO THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE DIFFERENCE IN SIZE IT'S ALSO DIFFERENT THOUGH BECAUSE CAMPUSES HAVE MUCH SOME CAMPUSES HAVE MUCH LARGER STUDENT HOUSING PROGRAMS AGAIN. ONE OF THE SOURCES OF MONEY AND THAT PAGE FORTY EIGHT TABLE IS FROM STUDENT HOUSING. SOME CAPS HAVE VERY LARGE STUDENT UNION SO THERE ARE QUITE A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT GENERATE CASH ON A CAMPUS AND THAT REPORT IS REALLY THE CASH BALANCE. AT THAT POINT IN TIME JUNE THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WITH REGARD TO RESERVES NOW WE'RE GONNA SHOP I'M GONNA SHIFT HERE BACK TO THE ONE POINT FIVE. MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS STILL IN THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS USING ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF RESERVES. THAT IS A SUBSET OF THE TOTAL THAT'S ONLY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN OUR WHAT WE CALL OUR OPERATING FUND. IT'S THE GENERAL ACTIVITY OF THE UNIVERSITY THAT WE THAT WE USED TO PAY FACULTY TO INSTRUCT THAT WE PAY ACADEMIC ADVISORS TO ADVISE STUDENTS WE PAY FACILITIES PEOPLE TO. MAINTAIN THE BUILDINGS IT'S OUR IT'S OUR OPERATING FUNDS OF THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. IS THAT PORTION OF THE TOTAL IT'S ATTRIBUTED TO THE OPERATING FUND. AND WITHIN THAT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. WE HAVE DESIGNATED IN ONE OF THE ELEVEN ACCOUNTS THAT WE DESIGNATE FOR PURPOSES OF RESERVES WE HAVE DESIGNATED FOUR HUNDRED SEVEN MILLION FOR ECONOMIC ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY THAT'S A SPECIFIC ACCOUNT THAT EACH CAMPUS USES ACROSS THE SYSTEM WE HAVE A COMMON DEFINITION FOR EACH OF THESE ELEVEN ACCOUNTS. AND CAMPUSES MAKE DECISIONS AS THE CHANCELLOR AND TRUSTEE MAJORITY OF IDENTIFIED. TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT RESERVE FOR DESIGNATED PURPOSES. GOT IT AND SO THAT'S DIRECT AS A DOCTOR. LET ME REPHRASE SO I WAS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS NOT A REPORT WAS TO SPECIFY HOW THESE FUNDS WERE. TO BE IDENTIFIED AND YOU'RE SAYING YOU'VE DONE THAT WITH THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY TO THE POINT OF FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOUR HUNDRED UP YES IT FOR ECONOMIC SPECIFIC THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY ECONOMIC OFFICIALLY IT'S FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF FOR ME ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LOWER LEVEL OF DETAIL SO THERE ARE. THERE ARE THREE ACCOUNTS WITHIN THE OPERATIONS RESERVE SO THE OPERATIONS RESERVE IS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION IT'S COMPRISED OF THREE ACCOUNTS. ONE ACCOUNT FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY ONE FOUR SEVEN. WHICH IS FOUR SEVEN ONE FOR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS THAT'S AN AMOUNT THAT WE RESERVE TO PAY SELF INSURED RETENTION. ON INSURANCE COVERAGE. AND THERE'S AN AMOUNT OF ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS NOT SPECIFIED IT'S HELPING ANOTHER ACCOUNT BUT IT WAS NOT SPECIFIED FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSE. SO THOSE THREE COUNTS COMPRISES THE GROUP OPERATIONS THERE ARE FIVE ACCOUNTS THAT COMPRISE THE GROUP SHORT TERM OBLIGATIONS AND THERE ARE THREE ACCOUNTS THAT COMPRISE THE GROUP OF CAPITAL. THOSE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE AGAIN RECORDED AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES USING A COMMON SET OF DEFINITIONS. THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL WAS OF COURSE PROVIDED DURING THE AUDIT BUT. THE THREE CATEGORIES ENDED UP BEING THE WAY WE DESCRIBE IT FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES GENERALLY SPEAKING WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE ELEVEN ACCOUNTS THAT YOU KNOW THIS LONG WINDED EXPLANATION I JUST GAVE YOU. CUT IT YEAH AND I'M JUST TRYING TO GET THE TRANSPARENCY WHERE THAT IS AND. WHAT IBM CORRECT IN ASSUMING THAT THIS IS NOW ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE PORTAL A OF MAY. YES SO YES IT'S ABOUT YES IT'S AVAILABLE. RIGHT DECISIONAL OPTIONS RIGHT NOW ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY'S LIKE EDGING TO GET IN HERE. AND THEN WE HAVE SUCH A RAW CONSIDERED A MINING. THANK YOU THAT CHANCE SO WHAT I HAVE I HAVE TWO ISSUES I WANT TO. TO DIG INTO A LITTLE BIT WITH YOU LIKE AND FRANKLY A LOT MORE OF I THINK THESE ARE THE TWO MOST MOST PRESSING ISSUES SO DURINGOUR ANNUAL BUDGET DISCUSSION WE TALK ABOUT THAT THE DESIRES OF THE CSU SYSTEM WHICH I'M A PRODUCT WHICH I. FULLY SUPPORT. IN A FOUR ENGINE FIFTY SOMETHING STUDENTS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SOME OF THOSE ARE ONGOING REQUESTS AND ONE TIME AND WE'VE DONE A LOT TO ADDRESS THOSE SINCE THE- RECESSION. SOME OF THOSE ARE ONE TIME NOW. AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK I WANT TO PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE YOU SAID IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE TO USE THESE TO. HIRE MORE STAFF TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT USE THESE THESE RESOURCES. BUT THERE ARE ONE TIME REQUEST THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO. ALWAYS ADDRESS AND- I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WAS EVER. ON THE TABLE TO BE TALKED ABOUT HEY. WE COULD HAVE A- A STATE CSU. PARTNERSHIP IN ABOUT BANQUET THAT WITH WITH YOU SEE IF YOU TIMES YOU KNOW WE PUT IN. X. AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR WILL PUT X. MONEY MONEY MORE FOR THE GRAD INITIATIVE. OR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. FOR SOME OF OUR- ISSUES THE WEEDS HERE FROM OUR STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS. YOU KNOW HUNGER. THE FOOD PANTRY SOME OF THESE ARE ARE ONE TIME REQUESTED I THINK THOSE COULD COULD COULD POTENTIALLY BE LEGITIMATE USES. OF THIS POT CAM RESPONSIBLE. SO THAT WAS NEVER REALLY ON THE TABLE FOR US TO. TO DIG INTO IN AND PROPOSE AND POTENTIALLY. WORK AT SO HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT THAT THAT THESE. COULD BE USED FOR POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE. INVESTMENTS IN OUR STUDENT POPULATION AND THE SYSTEM. MANY YEARS AGO CENTER ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY WHEN I WAS. A DEAN IT AT OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY I. HI AND BECAME PROVOST I LEARNED THAT YOU CAN SPEND A DOLLAR ONLY ONE TIME. AND IN THERE ARE A LOT OF X. DEANS OF FORMER DEAN SUED DIDN'T UNDERSTAND A DISK DISTINCTION BETWEEN ONE TIME USE IS AN ONGOING USES. SO WE HAVE AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE TO TRY NOT TO DO PERMANENT INVESTMENT ON TEMPORARY MONEY. COULD YOU JUST IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. NOW BECAUSE THIS IS MISTER WELL JUST POINTED OUT. ON OUR. OPERATING DESIGNATED RESERVES WE ACTUALLY SPECIFY WHAT THEY'RE USED FOR IT'S A AN EXPENSE ITEM FREE TO THE CAMPUSES AND FOR US IN THE CENTRAL OFFICE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GROWING THE STUDENT ACCESS FOR THE UNIVERSITY AND THE NEED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TENURE TRACK FACULTY WHICH IS A BIG ISSUE FOR OUR FACULTY IN FOR THE SENATE AND FOR US AND FOR THE STATE. HOW WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT ONE TIME YOU'LL MAKE THOSE KIND OF HIRING DECISIONS ON ONE TIME MONEY I'M NOT ASKING I'M ASKING ABOUT. I COULD BRING YOUR BUDGET REQUEST LIST YOU BROUGHT US FOR FIVE YEARS IN A ROW. THE MAJORITY OF THAT IS ONGOING REQUESTS BUT A BIG PART OF THAT ARE ONE TIME ASKS OF US THAT THE GRANT INITIATIVE THAT WE FUNDED. LAST COUPLE YEARS AS IT WAS BUT IT WAS ABOUT ONE TIME REQUEST FROM THE SYSTEM. WE FUNDED SOME ONE TIME EMISSIONS AS WELL SO THAT'S THEM LOOKING AS FAR AS SOMEONE ONE TIME MEASURE MCCARTY ACTUALLY GRADUATION INITIATIVE HAS NOT BEEN ON ONGOING REQUESTS. AND EVERY YEAR THAT WE'VE ADDED. SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO IT HAS BEEN ONGOING BASE. INCREASES. IN A ONE TIME TO RAISE TUITION. AS AN ONGOING FUND SOURCE IF. AS LONG AS OUR STUDENT POPULATION STAYS UP. AND THAT WAS USED ALSO FOR GRADUATION INITIATIVE. SO THE ONE TIME DOLLARS REALLY ARE USED MOSTLY FOR. CAPITAL PROJECTS COBBLE TOGETHER MONEY TO MAKE A DOWN PAYMENT ON RENOVATING ASSIGNS BUILDING IT'S ACTUALLY MAINTENANCE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT HAVE A SHORT TERM HORIZON TO THEM. YOU KNOW WE'RE PUTTING IN A NEW THE CONSOLIDATED HUMAN RESOURCE SYSTEMS EXPENSIVE TO DO OVER MULTIPLE YEARS AT A ONE TIME EXPENSE TO SET MONEY ASIDE. FOR THINGS OF ANY WE DO A UNIFIED IT. PROJECTS SO YOU'RE RIGHT THOUGH THAT THE STATE HAS GIVEN US ONE TIME MONEY FOR ACADEMIC THINGS AS WELL AND ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES WE'VE ALWAYS MADE THE CASE FOR AS WELL WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR WITH AND WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT WE STAFF AT ON A TEMPORARY BASIS ON A PERMANENT BASIS BECAUSE WE HAVE NO ASSURANCE THAT OF THAT PROGRAM STUDENTFUNDING STOP SO WE CAN CONTINUE IT. SO IT IS IT'S A DELICATE COMPLEX MATTER FOR US TO MANAGE WELL I DAHLE DISAGREE AND WE CAN SIT AND GO OVER OUR OUR BUDGETS THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND WE'VE APPROPRIATE PLENTY OF ALLOTMENTS OF ONE TIME MONEY KNOWING THAT'S NOT STAFFING IS TO ADDRESS YOU KNOW MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS BASIC NEEDS FOR A ONE TIME LIMITED STAFF POSITIONS KNOWING I'M NOT GOING TO BE ON THE LOOK I KNOW A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS HERE TO SET FEEL LIKE A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ONLY A FIVE MINUTE SO. I WANTED TO THE NOTION TO THE NOTION AS FAR AS THE METAL AND DISCLOSURE. WE GET ALL THAT BUT THAT THE WHOLE. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN MOVE FROM THE FACT THAT. CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU SAID DURING THE RECESSION. THE GREAT RECESSION REALLY WAS THAT THE THAT THE MAGNITUDE. OF THE WAS TAKEN FROM THE CSU SYSTEM. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY GOING TO THE CSU WENT DOWN BUT THE AMOUNT IN YOUR RESERVE FOR YOUR OPERATING FUND SURPLUS WHERE YOU WANT TO CALL IT WHY NOT SO IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO MEAN TO STUDENTS OUT THERE THAT THAT IN A TIME WHEN YOU NEED THE MONEY THE MOST. HE DIDN'T NECESSARILY USE IT BUT IT INCREASE. IF YOU ASK OF A LOOK THIS IS WHEN YOU HAD TO ASK. PEOPLE LIKE DR WEBER TO TAKE A 10% PAY CUT HER TAKER FOR LOW. AND STUDENT CLASSES WERE SLASHED WE INCREASE STUDENT FEES. YOU KNOW THAT THE ALL THE IMPACTS ON THE CAMPUS IT WAS PAINFUL FOR STUDENTS. CAN YOU WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW YOUR BANK ACCOUNTS INCREASED DURING THOSE TIMES THEY WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW W. TO AT I MIGHT. HI HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN HOW DOES IT WE NEED THE MONEY THE MOST IT'S THEIR AN INCREASE SO THAT THAT JUST DOESN'T. MAKE SENSE IS NO LOGIC BEHIND THAT SO. HOW DO YOU RESPOND SO I WOULD RESPOND BY SAYING THAT THE BREAD ROLLS GONNA TO CLARIFY THE DETAILS HERE FOR YOU. I WASN'T IN THE CSU THEM BUT I WAS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND LIKEWISE WE DO THE SAME PROCESSOR OF. ACTUALLY MANY OF US TOOK A 15% FROM A CUT IN OUR SOURS AND OTHERS 210% ON A FOR LOW BASIS. THAT GREAT RECESSION AFFECTED SO MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE NATION ACROSS THE WORLD WE WERE NOT. IMMUNE TO THAT RECESSION AND EVERYBODY HAD TO DO THEIR PEACE. HELLO YEAH. SPREAD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DETAILS ON YOUR QUESTION. TRY TO BE VERY. ST THE COMPARISON FOR TERMS OF USING THE RESERVE ON THAT CHART OCCURRED BETWEEN. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IT'S BETWEEN SEVEN EIGHT EIGHT NINE WHICH WAS IT WHICH ISN'T ON THE CHART. IF YOU STEP BACK ONE YEAR WE USED THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. TO HELP MITIGATE THE REDUCTIONS THAT WERE WE WERE EXPERIENCING AT THAT TIME. THAT WASN'T HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU STATE THAT FROM EIGHT OH NINE TO NINE TEN THE AMOUNT ESSENTIALLY DOUBLE OF YOU ASKED I WAS ANSWERED THE QUESTION ABOUT WAS THE MONEY USED BY THAT TIME. THE CUTS HAD BEEN IMPLEMENTED THE FURLOUGHS HAVE BEEN BEGUN IN THE TUITION INCREASES THAT HAPPENED. AND ONE MIGHT SUGGEST THAT WE OVER RECENT RESPONDED BUT AT THAT TIME NOBODY REALLY KNEW HOW BAD THIS WAS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE. SO IT YOU WILL BE MIGHT SIT TODAY LOOKING BACK TEN YEARS AND DECIDED THAT THAT WAS. TO PRUDENT PERHAPS BUT AT THE TIME. WE USED WE HAD YOU'D GET TAKEN OUR RESERVES DOWN FROM OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOWN TO THREE HUNDRED THANK CUT THEM IN HALF AND WE'RE DEALING WITH MID YEAR REDUCTION SO IT WAS IT WAS A QUITE A DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCE I THINK WHAT EVERYONE'S TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT ANY JUST I'M SORRY TO DESPONDENT TO YOUR QUESTION THE OTHER CUT IS THE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SO. THAT GREEN LINE IS NOT CASH THAT GREEN LINE IS. RESERVES. YOU'LL YOU'LL NOTICE WHEN THE STATE BORROWED SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH FROM THE C. ISSUE TO MAKE PAYROLL. THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT REFLECTED ON THE CHART. IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT IS NOT REFLECTED BECAUSE IT WAS CASH. THAT WAS MOVED FROM THE C. ISSUE TO THE STATE TO MAKE PAYROLL. THE STATE HAD SAID AT THE TIME AS YOU RECALL THAT. IT WAS GONNA BE IS GONNA PAY THAT MONEY BACK. SO IT WE HAD A RECEIVABLE. SO THAT THAT CHARGE IS NOT A MEASURE OF. CASH IT'S A MEASURE OF BUDGETED RESERVE AND AMOUNT THAT WE ANTICIPATE USING AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE FOR THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN DISCUSSING. BUT YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE WORST YEAR IF I RECALL AND I WAS IN HEARING DOCTOR PAN AND THE ONLY ONE WHO WASN'T JUST LEFT. HIS THAT THE TEN WAS THE WORST YEAR SEE WITH THINK THAT YEAR WHEN. YOU SEE THAT AMOUNT IN THERE CSU. PIGGY BANK TO GO DOWN AND IT IS LIKE IT'S A RAINY DAY FUND THERE'S A MONSOON OUTSIDE AND SO YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD GO. NOT QUITE ZERO BUT SIGNIFICANTLY. DOWN SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES US SCRATCH OUR HEAD IS A COURSE IT MAY BE LOGICAL TO HAVE THIS POLICY FOR THE FUTURE BUT AFTER SITTING HERE TODAY SHOULD TO BE GREAT THIS. RESERVE GOING FORWARD TO PROTECT US AGAINST YEAH. BUT YOU GO BACK LOOK AT PAST HISTORY LIKE WHEN WE DID HAVE A NEED FOR THIS. IT DIDN'T QUITE PLAY OUT THAT WAY THAT'S WHY I THINK IT GIVES. THAT'S GREAT CONCERN COUPLE OF THE FACT THAT WE GET LINED UP OUT THE DOOR OF STUDENTS THAT ARE BUDGET HEARINGS TALK ABOUT. PRESSING NEEDS TODAY SELLERS THOSE THINGS JUST I THINK CREATE A PICTURE FOR US THE CRUISE A LOT OF. YEAH COMFORT AND WE HAVE TO RECALL THAT THAT CHARTER ONLY DEALS WITH A PORTION OF THE- RESERVE THAT IS. THE AS AS THE STATE APPROPRIATION WAS REDUCED. AND THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE COLLECTED FROM STUDENT TUITION INCREASED THAT MONEY BECAME AVAILABLE TO US FOR RESERVE. PRIOR. TO THAT. THE MONEY WAS HELD IN THE STATE TREASURY. WE DIDN'T HOLD. BALANCES WE THE BIG THEY WOULD'VE READ THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN PART OF THE REVERSION PROCESS. WHICH AS YOU KNOW TAKES THREE YEARS SO WE WERE THAT BALANCES. IN THE GENERAL FUND THAT WOULD BE RECORDED ON THAT ON THAT TABLE. SO THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN A AND PRACTICES THAT OCCURRED AT THE SAME TIME THAT IS. TUITION WAS INCREASED. COOPERATION WAS REDUCED AND THE BALANCE IS REPORTED IN A SINGLE FUND HELD OUTSIDE THE STATE TREASURY. OKAY THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT I WAS LOOKING AT PAGE FIFTEEN AS WELL AND JUST THE CHART LOOKS TROUBLING RIGHT BECAUSE IT IMPLIES THAT. YOU KNOW WHY I WAS THE CSU INCREASING ITS RESERVE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WHEN YOU SHOULD BE DRAWING ON THE RESERVE AS OPPOSED INCREASING AT. RIGHT AND THAT'S PROBABLY A LOT OF THE ANGST OF MISSED MCCARTY. SEEN IN HIS SUBCOMMITTEE AND PROBABLY EVERYONE THAT'S ON DEALING WITH BUDGET IN EACH OF US. AS WE WERE VISITED BY MANY STUDENTS OVER THE LAST. WELL SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION. RIGHT WITH THAT WILL MOVE TO SENATOR ROTH THAN ASSEMBLYMEMBER MURATSUCHI THAN SENATOR MINING AND SENATOR CROSS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ST SITTING HERE LISTENING TO THIS I HAVE TO. AGREE WITH MS PAYING IT'S SO DIFFICULT AT SOME POINTS TO TELL WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE WE TALK ABOUT ONE POINT. FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVE I'M NOT AN ACCOUNTANT SO I'M CERTAINLY NOT AN AUDITOR. BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A BIT OF SEMANTICS WE TALK ABOUT A SURPLUS WE TALK ABOUT A RESERVE BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE APPROPRIATE ONE HUNDRED MILLION OR TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. FOR A THREE YEAR PROGRAM MORE FOR YOUR PROGRAM AND LEAVE IT TO YOU TO ALLOCATE I PERSONALLY AS IT DOES NOT HONOR AND NOT AN ACCOUNTANT. DON'T CONSIDER. THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION AS A SURPLUS. AND I DON'T EVEN CONSIDER IT AS A RESERVE. IF YOU'VE SAID IT ALL UP THE FIRST YEAR TO BE GONE IF YOU HOLD IT FOR THREE AND SENATE THE THIRD YEAR IT'S GONE BUT IT'S NOT THE SURPLUS IS NOT RESERVE NOW MAYBE THOSE RECOUNTING AN AUDIT TERMS THAT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHICH IS QUITE POSSIBLE. BUT I WHAT I LIKE TO SEE HERE IS AND I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS IS THAT YOU. YOU SEPARATE OUT THOSE THINGS THAT WE THROW AROUND HERE IS APPARENTLY PART OF THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WHICH ARE CERTAINLY NOT SURPLUS. IN A REALLY NOT A RESERVE. AND LET'S GET DOWN TO WHAT WE REALLY ARE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF DOLLARS SO THAT. WE CAN DECIDE WHETHER REALLY OUTRAGED OR OR NOT QUITE AS OUTRAGED BECAUSE OF. OF WHAT YOU'RE HOLDING IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH IT. SO THAT'S ONE COMMENT I HAVE AND THEN JUST ANOTHER COMMENT. NOT TO PUT ANYBODY ON THE SPOT BUT IT HAS TO DO WITH PARKING. AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND I AND OF MEMBERS OF OUR- RESPECTIVE SUBCOMMITTEES. HAS SPENT A LOT OF TIME OVER THE LAST YEAR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. DRIVE MORE MONEY DOWN TO THE- STUDENTS AS PART OF THE PROCESS WHETHER IT'S EXPANDING CAL GRANTS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE COVERAGE SLOTS OR ANY NUMBER OF. OF ISSUES WERE TRYING TO DO WAS IN WAYS WERE TRYING TO. IMPROVE THE LOT OF STUDENTS WHO WERE SIMPLY TRYING TO GET THROUGH. SCHOOL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THIS THIS IMPACT OF PARKING FEES ON STUDENTS AND PERHAPS SOME IN EQUITY IN THE PROCESS OF HOW OTHER CERTAIN WHO PAYS WHAT. IS OF CONCERN TO ME AND- CHESSER AND TRUSTEE I WOULD SIMPLY ASK THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND HELP US TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND MAKE THIS. WORK FOR STUDENTS BECAUSE IT'S MY IMPRESSION ANYWHERE PERCEPTION. THE MANY OF YOUR CAMPUSES ARE COMMUTER CAMPUSES. OF AT LEAST A SIGNIFICANT PART AND SO PER KING. THERE IS A MAJOR PART OF A STUDENT'S LIFE AND THE COST OF PARKING. WOULD SOON ME IS PROBABLY A MAJOR PART OF THE STUDENT THIS BUDGET. ONE ONE OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE OF THE AUDIT WAS US ACTUALLY SEEING THOSE FEES. LAID OUT AND IT IT IS A CAUSE FOR ME LEASES A TRUSTEE OF GREAT CONCERN THAT. THE EMPLOYEE AT THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE THE LEAST ABILITY TO PAY. A PAYING MORE THAN THE SELLER TO BOYS AND THAT THAT I THINK IS AN INEQUITABLE SITUATION. JUST THANK YOU FOR TAKING A LOOK AT LEAD I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO SOLVE IT HERE AT THE TABLE BUT- I KNOW YOU WILL. THANK YOU WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU CHANCELLOR WHITE I'M LOOKING AT TO YOUR LETTER DATED MAY THIRTIETH OF TWENTY NINETEEN SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THE DRAFT AUDIT REPORT. AND YOU DO HAVE A COPY OF THAT NO I DON'T OKAY. ALL RIGHT. WELL AS A COPY IS. BEING PROVIDED I COULD SEE. AS YOU MAY RECALL THE BOTTOM OF THAT. FIRST. PAGE AS NOTED IN UP TO APPENDIX B. THE OVERALL DESIGNATED RIVERS RESERVE AMOUNT REPRESENTS ABOUT 2% OF ANNUAL EXPENSES. COME I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THE OVERALL DESIGNATED RESERVE AMOUNT AS NOTED IN AN APPENDIX B. IS THAT THAT THREE POINT NINE. BILLION DOLLAR FIGURE. THAT'S SHOWN. ON PAGE FORTY EIGHT OF THE AUDIT A TEN YEAR PERIOD SO THEY'RE DIVIDING THE REPRINT SERVE ON JUNE THE STATE PART REPORT DIVIDES THE- IF YOU COULD SPEAK INTO THE MIKE PLEASE EXCUSE ME. THE OUT REPORT DIVIDES THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN DESIGNATED RESERVE. INTO THE TOTAL. EXPENSES OVER THE TEN YEAR PERIOD AUDITED. OKAY IS THAT THE CORRECT. IT'S REFERENCING YOU IF THE ITEM IN THE AUDIT REPORT SO IT'S ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DIVIDED BY THE TOTAL EXPENSES OVER THE TEN YEAR PERIOD ON. ALRIGHT TEN YEARS WORTH OF PROPERTY. SO. BUT FOR ANY WAR GIVEN FISCAL YEAR ARE YOU INDICATING THAT THAT THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. IS THE AVERAGE DESIGNATE A RESERVE AMOUNT. SO EACH SO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE HAD EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS LEFT OVER AT THE END OF THE YEAR BASED ON TOTAL REVENUES OF SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION. THAT EIGHTY THREE MILLION IS ABOUT 1% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES AND THAT EIGHTY THREE MILLION WAS WOULD WOULD BE DEPOSITED OR ACCOUNTED FOR AS A RESERVE. AS AN ADDITION TO THE RESERVE. OF THE YEAR BEFORE THAT IN TWO THOUSAND. FIFTEEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. TOTAL REVENUES WERE ABOUT SEVEN BILLION WE HAVE LEFT OVER AT THE END OF THE YEAR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT FIFTY MILLION WOULD HAVE BEEN ADDED TO RESERVES ALL RIGHT. I DON'T WANT TO GET. TOO LOST IN THE NUMBERS BUT GOING BACK TO YOUR LETTER. OF MAY THIRTIETH TWENTY NINETEEN YOU INDICATE IN THE BOTTOM OF PAGE ONE THAT THE OVERALL DESIGNATED RIVER CONSERVE AMOUNT REPRESENTS ABOUT 2% OF ANNUAL EXPENSES. WHAT WHAT REPRESENTS THE 2% OF ANNUAL EXPENSE THE AUDIT REPORT APPENDIX B. THE. THE I'M SORRY. SO THAT'S A RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT REPORT. SO THREE THREE BILLION I'M SORRY. ON ON TABLE BE ONE ON PAGE FORTY SEVEN OF OUR REPORT YES. THE CALCULATION WOULD BE TO TAKE THE ONE POINT FIVE AND DIVIDE IT BY SEVENTY FOUR MILLION BILLION DOLLARS. SO THE WAY I THOUGHT IT WAS CONSTRUCTED THEY ADDED UP TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE TEN YEARS AND TOTAL EXPENSES FOR THE TEN YEARS THAT'S THE BASIS UPON WHICH THESE CALCULATIONS ARE MADE SO WE WERE JUST. TAKING ONE POINT FIVE BILLION BY TO GET INTO THAT CONTINUE REPORTED AND APPENDIX B. IN THE AUDIT REPORT ALL RIGHT HI I AM I AM NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOU BUT I WON'T BE LEAVING TO GO TO THE LA COUNTY. IS ALISTAIR SHE AND CORRECT WANTED TO POINT OUT IN THE. AUDITOR'S REPORT ON PAGE SIXTEEN FIGURE FIVE. I THINK THIS IS WHAT MISTER WELLS IS REFERRING TO YOU CAN SEE. THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS AND THEN HOW THE MONEY IS USED. THE ONE POINT. HOW ALL THE APPROPRIATIONS ARE YEARS FOR CS YEAR WHAT IT'S SAYING IS AT THE VERY END AFTER ALL HAS MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT ON SALARIES AND BENEFITS SUPPLIES AND SERVICES SCHOLARSHIP GRANTS AND OTHERS. THERE'S 2% LEFT OVER. I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT CSU IS REFERRING TO THE 2% LEFTOVER LET'S NOT SPENT ON SPECIFIC ITEMS IN NINE. PARTICULAR YEAR FOR YEARS AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAME UP WITH ONE POINT 52% AND THAT'S THE ONE POINT FIVE IS THE 2% DOES THAT HELP YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI. IT I WANT TO ASK VIA CSU REPRESENTED IS THAT. THAT IS ALSO TRUE THAT'S NOT THE 2% THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE 2% WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS TAKING THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVE AT A POINT IN TIME. AND DIVIDING IT. BY SEVENTY BY SEVENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF EXPENSE SEVENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF EXPENSES. OKAY ON ON THE APPENDIX THAT THAT'S THAT'S ALL THAT IS OKAY I KNOW FROM MY. EXPERIENCE ON A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD THAT WE HAD AT THAT TIME. MINIMUM RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY OF 2% THIS FEATURE A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY HAVE A SIMILAR OPERATE OPERATING MINIMUM RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY NO THAT'S ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE IN THE AUDIT REPORT THAT WE ARE WORKING TO IMPLEMENT AND SO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. OF CSU INTENDS TO ADOPT A MINIMUM OF RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE WORDED WHAT THE GUIDELINES ARE GOING TO BE BUT WE ACCEPTED THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE OUR STATE AUDITOR'S WE DON'T HAVE MEANT ON THERE IS A MAXIMUM FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY OF SIX MONTHS. BUT THERE IS NO MINIMUM OKAY. BOB MOVING ON TO A GOOD A DIFFERENT TO. AREA QUESTIONS TO IT I WAS LOOKING AT THE HOUSE. WAS RESEARCH IF I MAY JUST REAL QUICK. LET ME JUST ASK A QUICK QUESTION BECAUSE RUN UP THE MAY THIRTIETH LETTER. AND SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MAY THIRTIETH LETTER YOU KNOW YOU ALSO INDICATED LET'S USE CSU WILL IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE OUR REPORT TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. AND THEY SAID CSU SAYS UP THOUGH. EMPLOYMENT THESE TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN. I I'LL MENTION IN MY COMMENTS AND A MISSION OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING WE WILL. ACT POSITIVELY ON EVERY RECOMMENDATION OF THE STATE AUDITOR. SO WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS ACTUALLY. SEE EACH OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS LISTED IN THE AUDIT REPORT THAT IS CORRECT OKAY AND WE'RE HOPING TO DO THAT BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. NEXT YEAR WE SHOULD HAVE. THEN DONE THIS YEAR IF NOT IT'LL JUST SLUSH OVER A LITTLE BIT WE HAVE OUR FIRST REPORT DUE TO THE AUDITOR'S SIXTY DAYS FOREVER FOR WHICH IS ABOUT THREE WEEKS NINE OF AN IMPORTANT WE'VE PUT TOGETHER THE WORKING GROUP'S AND WE TAKE LEVEL ALL ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE FIRST TWELVE MONTHS THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. CLARITY YES RARE CITY PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU. CHESS I WANT I WANT TO A REFER TO THE AUDITOR'S FACT SHEET. AND THEN ONE OF THE KEY FINDINGS THAT THEY LIST. IS CSU DID NOT DISCLOSE THE SURPLUS WHEN A PROVIDED THE STUDENT ASSOCIATION WITH INFORMATION ABOUT RAISING TUITION FOR THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ACADEMIC HERE IT ONLY PRESENTED TO ALTERNATIVES TO RAISING TUITION. INCREASING STATE FUNDING FOR REDUCING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES CAN YOU PROVIDE A SPECIFIC AYE AYE GOING I BELIEVE I HEARD YOU INDICATE EARLIER THAT YOU PROVIDED A REPORT THERE THAT THE SPECIFICALLY. DISCLOSED THE. RESERVE AS. WELL I AT LEAST YOU YOU DESERVE YOU DISCLOSE THE RESERVE AMOUNT COULD COULD CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT FINDING A STATE. DURING OUR TEMPTATION TO THE STUDENTS THAT ONE MANDATORY SECTION HOUSE WHAT OTHER SOURCES WILL BE USED FOR. AND WE INTERPRETED THAT AS ONGOING EXPENSES THE UNIVERSITY. IN AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE WE DON'T USE A ONE TIME FUNDS FOR ON GOING. SO IS THAT REASON AND THAT REASON ONLY WHY WE DIDN'T PUT IT ON THE TABLE BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU WHEN WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WHICH WE DO ANNUALLY WITH OUR STUDENTS. WILL NOW SAY IN THAT REPORT. WE ALSO HAVE RESERVE FUNDS AND WILL GO THROUGH THE THREE BIG BANDS AND WHAT THEY'RE USED FOR WHAT THEY CAN'T BE USED FOR. SO THERE'S NO AMBIGUITY ON THAT ISSUE GOING FORWARD. ALL RIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION AMMANAI. I AM. ALSO APPRECIATE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN. ONE TIME COST VERSUS ONGOING COST. LIKE I KNOW THAT YOUR- RESPONSIBILITY. TO THE STUDENTS INTO THE ENTIRE. UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY IS TO. PROVIDE STABILITY AND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT LIKE YOU INDICATED YOU CAN ONLY SPEND DOLLAR ONCE SO I DO APPRECIATE TO. YOU KNOW HOW BEING FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE I'M AND BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DO APPRECIATE THAT THAT YOU'RE INDICATING THAT GOING FORWARD THAT YOU WILL BE DISCLOSING. THE RESERVES AS. AND A POTENTIAL OPTION PERHAPS. THE MERITS OF USING THE RESERVES FOR ONGOING FUNDS CAN BE DEBATED AT THAT TIME BUT AT LEAST IT WILL BE PRESENTED TO US AS AN OPTION AND DEBATED AT THAT TIME. YEAH I THINK THAT'S SOME OF THE COMMENTS OF US PAYING HAD INDICATED AS WELL SO I'M SURE MORE INFORMATION WOULD. REALLY BE APPRECIATED ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENTS. WAS THAT IT WAS PAINTED TO SORT OF HELP ASK YOU'LL GIVE US ALL QUESTIONS IN A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN. PRESENT OUR. COMPLEX FINANCES IN A WAY THAT. MEETS THEIR INTERESTS AND NEEDS MA'AM. SERVER WHAT WILL WORK TOGETHER ON THIS IS THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE HERE. UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT ARE LET'S MOVE TO SENATOR MONICA PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WANT TO START WITH A QUESTION TO STUDENT VICE PRESIDENT PAYING. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND FOR YOUR WORK WITH THE STUDENT GOVERNANCE FOR C. ISSUE. ON DO YOU RECEIVE ANY COMPENSATION FOR YOUR ROLE AS STUDENT VICE PRESIDENT. THANK YOU I RECEIVE A SCHOLARSHIP SEAT THERE IS SOME CONSIDERATION FOR THE TIME YOU'RE SPENDING. IN ADDITION TO YOUR STUDIES YES GOOD ONE GLAD TO HEAR THAT IN ONE OF YOUR COMMENTS WAS THE DIFFICULTY OF DECIPHERING SOME OF THIS INFORMATION IS CONTAINED IN THE AUDIT IS CARRIED IN NEWSPAPER REPORTS MOVING FORWARD FROM THE PRESENTATION OF THE AUDIT TODAY. WHAT TOOLS DO YOU HAVE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE BROADER STUDENT BODY. WHAT IS COMING OUT OF TODAY'S HEARING SOME OF THE COMMENTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION. WHAT VEHICLES WERE MEANS YOU HAVE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE BROADER STUDENT BODY. SURE SO WE ARE MEAN MONTHLY FOR OUR PLUNDERING MEETINGS WHERE WE DISCUSS CSU ISSUES WITH OF REPRESENT A REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES SO THAT'S KIND OF OUR MAIN SPACES SHARE INFORMATION AND HAVE A DISCUSSION BUT DEFINITELY WE MOVING FORTY ONE TO SHARE THAT RESPONSIBILITY WITH THE INSTITUTION SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST US TRYING TO DECIPHER AND AGAIN SIFT THROUGH THE INFORMATION. BUT THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY IS SHARED AND IT'S A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. THINKING YOU ALSO INDICATED THAT YOU HAVE HAD SOME MEETINGS WITH THE CHANCELLOR AND HIS STAFF ON DURING THE. COURSE OF THE AUDIT. IS THERE AN ON GOING. SCHEDULING OF ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CHANCELLOR OR HIS HIS STAFF. UP WE'VE DISCUSSED WAYS TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION MOVING FORWARD WE DON'T HAVE SCHEDULED ARE STANDING CALLS BUT IF THAT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE WILL DEFINITELY DISCUSS IN THE FUTURE WE ALSO WELCOME THAT STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO COME TO US PRESENT TO OUR STUDENTS BUT BASICALLY WE OPEN ANY INVITATION TO CONTINUES TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH OUR STUDENTS. IN CLEARLY YOUR ROLE IS REPRESENTING STUDENT INTERESTS. DO YOU HAVE ANY STRUCTURED ENGAGEMENT WITH. UNIVERSITY STAFF ON EITHER FACULTY OR STAFF THAT ARE WORKING AT THE VARIOUS CAMPUSES SURE SO I I'M IN I SERVE AS AN EXECUTIVE ROLE FOR THE CAL STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION IT'S MORE SO. A REPRESENTATION OF. ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES BUT FOR CAMPUS BY CAMPUS IT VARIES THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR ADMINISTRATION. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE IS DIALOGUE AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE STUDENTS AND- THE BARGAINING UNITS OF FACULTY AND STAFF. IT'S NOT A TRICK QUESTION I'M JUST THINKING PART OF THIS BUDGET CONCERNS. FIRST AND FOREMOST EVERYBODY IN THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS STUDENT LEARNING AN EXCELLENT SOME SUCCESS. BUT A BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO THAT ARE THE BARGAINING UNITS THE- CLEAN THE CLASSROOMS THAT. PROVIDE THE TEACHING THAT NOT OURS IS FULL TIME FACULTY WORK AS AN ADJUNCT FACULTY. THEY SHARE CONCERNED IN HAVE THIS BUDGET IS ALSO SHARED AN INTERPRETED SO I WAS JUST CURIOUS THE EXTENT TO WHICH STUDENTS. ARE SENSITIVE TO THE CONCERNS OF THE BARGAINING UNITS WHO ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF YOUR EDUCATION. I WOULD SAY THAT. I WOULD CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR BETTER AND MORE STUDENT REPRESENTATION WHEN IT COMES TO BARGAINING UNITS. THANK YOU AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE TODAY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING EVERY DAY BUT LET ME TURN TO THE CHANCELLOR OR OR YEAR TEAM. ON. YOU'RE FREE TO REMARK ON ANY OF THAT EXCHANGE BUT MY REAL CONCERN AND FOLLOW UP WAS STARTED BY SENATOR ROTH BUT ON THE QUESTION OF PARKING. THE CHALLENGE OF THE COST OF THAT TO STUDENTS THE AVAILABILITY OF PARKING TO STUDENTS. IN AS WAS COMMENTED BY TRUSTING MCGRORY THE APPARENT INEQUITY OF SALARIED EMPLOYEES PAYING LESS THAN STUDENTS. I THINK SENATOR ROTH DIDN'T PUSH YOU ON IDEAS BUT I WILL A LITTLE BIT DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON MOVING FORWARD HOW TO ADDRESS. PARKING IS A GENERAL ISSUE COST TO STUDENTS AS A MORE SPECIFIC CONCERN COMBINED WITH THE BURDENS STUDENTS ARE FACING OF. MEETING TUITION IN BUYING BOOKS SINCE IN SOME CASES SUPPORTING FAMILIES HOLDING DOWN MANY JOBS. WELL THE SOO SEVERAL POINTS LET ME TRY AND CIRCLE BACK AROUND ON ON A COUPLE OF THEM. FIRST OF ALL OF WITH RESPECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WE HAVE STUDENT TO STUDENT TRUSTEES WHO ARE. IN OUR COLLECTIVE BOTH OPEN AND CLOSE SESSIONS OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TO STUDENT VOICE TO THE TRUSTEES IS THERE NOT SO MUCH TO STUDENT GOVERNOR CSSA. WITH RESPECT TO STUDENTS INVOLVEMENT WITH CAMPUS BUDGETS EVERY CAMPUS IS REQUIRED TO HAVE A BUDGET ADVISORY COMMITTEE BY WHATEVER NAME. AND STUDENTS ARE MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE AS WELL SO THEY HAVE THEIR VOICE AT THE TABLE INTERACTING WITH THE- CAMPUS PRESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT'S FINANCE EXETER AT THAT TIME. YOU PARKING IS SUCH A VEXING ISSUE FOR US AND- ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND PROBABLY WILL BE FOR A WHILE. THE COST IS REAL YOU KNOW BY LAW IT HAS TO BE A TOUGH ONE ITS OWN BOTTOM SO WE CAN'T USE ANY FUND OTHER THAN GENERATED FOR PARKING FEES ARE FOR. AND FIND TAKE CENTER FOR THAT OPERATION. THE FACT THAT EMPLOYEES PAY LESS AND STUDENTS AS A RESULT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING OF THE PAST. ARE A MAJOR CONTRACTOR ALL OPENING UP DURING THIS NEXT TWELVE MONTHS SO I THINK YOU WILL SEE IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING DISCUSSION TO DIFFERENT CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD. THE AVAILABILITY ISSUE IS WHILE WE HAVE BEEN ADDING PARKING TO THE CAMPUSES ARE MORE COMPUTER MORE COMMUTER URGE OTHER THAN THAN OTHERS. WE'VE ALSO BEEN ADDING STUDENTS FORTY ONE THOUSAND MORE BODIES. AND SO WHILE THE NUMBER HAS GONE UP TO SORT OF NUMBER TO STUDENT RATIOS IS THE AUDITOR CORRECTLY POINTS OUT. HAS MOVED IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS ON THE FOUR CAMPUSES THEY LOOK LOOKED AT CAREFULLY COUPLE I GOT A LITTLE BETTER IN A COUPLE ACTUALLY GOT A LITTLE WORSE. UP. I THINK THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF THE PARKING GOING FORWARD IS REALLY INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT OF THOMAS VEHICLES IN THE RIDE SHARING SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND WE THINK ABOUT PARKING NEEDS TEN YEARS FROM NOW. WHAT OUR STUDENTS TEN YEARS AND I CAN BE THINKING ABOUT TRANSPORTATION. AND CERTAINLY IN THE URBAN AREAS ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION CAN BE DONE MUCH FOR ROBUSTLY I THINK THEN PERHAPS MORE RURAL CAMPUS WHERE THE CITY OR COUNTY INFRASTRUCTURES AND SUPPLY. SO WE HAVE OUR CANNOT FORCE AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS COMMENTED TO TAKE MORE DEEPLY ON ALTERNATIVE BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING THROUGH QUITE A CHANGE IN THE WAY OUR STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR OF WILL BE THINKING ABOUT TRANSPORTATION. AND FINALLY ALSO THIS TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE IS A REAL DILEMMA AND CHALLENGE IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY ON MANY OF OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES COASTAL CAMPUSES WHERE HE DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IT'S MONEY WHETHER IT'S TUITION OR WHETHER IT'S A HOUSING OR THEIR TRANSPORTATION OR PARKING OR FOOD OR- WHAT HAVE YOU AS THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND SO SOME OF THE- THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN OF. DONE WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL AID HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO RESOURCES FOR. WE DON'T WANT THE LACK OF RESOURCES TO GET AWAY FOR STUDENTS WHO OFTEN LOW INCOME AND OFTEN FIRST JAN. TO COME TO THE CSU AND SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD ON THAT. IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO GET PARKING REVENUES. UP IN ONE AREA WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DROP THE GUN AND OTHER IT BUT THAT IS. A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS AND I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHY DIFFERENT. CAPACITIES THAT CENTURY. I THINK WE AT ALL NOW IS THE TRANSPORTATION. MEANS AND MODALITIES IS RAPIDLY CHANGING BUT FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE THERE TODAY OR FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WAIT FOR THOSE. THOSE LONGER TERM CHANGES IN THE REMEDIES NEEDED NOW BUT I DO APPRECIATE THIS CLARIFICATIONS IF I COULD THROUGH THE CHAIR I THINK ANA VICE PRESIDENT PAYING HAD A COMMENT IN IF I COULD JUST TO LISTEN THAT IN THE LEASE ON THE FINISH. THANK YOU. SO YES STUDENTS ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT FOR YEARS THE CSU HASN'T ADDRESSED. PARKING IN EQUITIES AND THROUGH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS AYE THING MOVING FORWARD IT'LL BE GREAT TO SEE WHERE THAT WERE THAT MOVES. BUT WE ARE ALSO DISAPPOINTED THAT OUR OWN LEGISLATIVE ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THIS ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE THIRTY TWO. BY SO MANY WOMEN WEBER WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE INSTITUTION OR FACULTY OR STAFF REPRESENTATIVES. AND STUDENTS REALLY NEED AND YOU EVERYONE AT THE TABLE AND AT THIS COMMITTEE HEARING. TO TRULY LISTEN TO OUR CONCERNS. AND IF YOU KNOW YOU ALL CANNOT FIND POLICY SO LUCIEN'S TODAY TO ADDRESS OUR FORD ABILITY CONCERNS. THAN TO ACTUALLY. SUPPORT THE INTENT OF OURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU WITHOUT ONE OF TWO SENATOR DRAWS A- THANK YOU I WANT TO ASK DO YOU HAVE AN OR HAVE YOU EVER HAD A WRITTEN EXPLICIT POLICY ON OF THIS RESERVE WHATEVER TERMINOLOGY WANTED TO USE IN REFERENCE TO IT. YES WE DO. WHEN DID YOU ONE WAS THAT. PUT TOGETHER A. TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND HOW WAS THAT DISTRIBUTED OR SHARED OR- PUT OUT THERE SO THAT. EVERY TIME THERE'S A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FINANCES OF. THE UNIVERSITY IS THAT THAT WOULD BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION. IT WAS PREPARED IN RESPONSE TO THE PREVIOUS STATE AUDIT. AND IT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES AND IT'S POSTED ON OUR PUBLIC POLICY SIDE CALLED SEE ISSUE RESERVES. IT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETING IN SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. AS WELL AS IN CONCERT WITH THE DISCUSSION AT THE BOARD MEETING WITH REGARD TO SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL PLAN. DO YOU THINK THAT WAS. DO YOU THINK THAT WHAT THE WAY THAT YOU DISTRIBUTED TO WHO YOU DISTRIBUTED. REALLY MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS HOW THIS FUNDING WAS WORKING. I MEAN I'M AND THE REASON I ASK IS AS MRS PAYING. AS THIS TANK SAID IT'S SO HARD TO. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS LIKE SUCH TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF AND IT MAKES IT FEEL VERY MYSTERIOUS OF AS TO WHAT WAS WHAT WAS SHARED HOW IT WAS SHARED HOW TRUTHFUL HEALTH MUCH WAS PUT OUT CLEARLY EVERY TIME THERE WAS A CONVERSATION THAT THAT SHOULD BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION. I'VE SERVED ON BOARDS WITH THERE'S LIKE A TWO MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET TO HUNDREDS A MILLION DOLLARS AND NOW TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS AND NO BUDGET TO BE SO COMPLICATED. THAT THERE'S NOT CLARITY IN TERMS OF WHAT'S- WHAT FUNDING AS THEY ARE AND HOW IT'S BEING SPENT AND WHAT FUNDING IS AVAILABLE BECAUSE USUALLY WILL NOT EVEN WITH UPS AND DOWNS YOU'LL HAVE YOU'LL AT SOME POINT SAY WELL I WANT TO MOVE THIS FROM THERE TO HERE THIS THAT THAT'S USUALLY PART OF BUDGET CONVERSATIONS. THAT SEEM TO BE LACKEY. AS FAR AS CONSIDERATIONS AND OPTIONS THAT WERE MADE AVAILABLE WHETHER IT WAS STUDENT TUITION INCREASES. IT JUST SEEMS SO COMPLETELY. STRANGE THAT THEY WOULD BE SUCH DIFFERENT VERSIONS SO HI I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT WAS BECAUSE IN THE ORGANIZATIONS I SERVED. WE ALWAYS HAD IT UP POLICY AND EVERY TIME WE DISCUSSED EVERY YEAR WE DISCUSS THE BUDGET THAT WAS CLEARLY PUT ON THE TABLE DO WE GROW WHAT DO WE USE IT WHAT WHAT WAS IT THEREFORE AND I WAS ALWAYS A VERY CLEAR PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE. A SEEM TO BE MISSING HERE HERE AND. I IT SEEMS TO BE A PART A BIG PART OF WHY THERE IS A PROBLEM. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M NOT SAYING DELIBERATE LIKE ANYBODY WAS PUTTING MONEY IN THEIR POCKET AND NOT AND I DON'T MEAN DELIBERATE THAT WAY I MEAN. JUST SOMETHING'S WRONG IT THAT WAY SOMETHING'S WRONG. AND IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT COMPLICATED. TO FIGURE OUT. THANK YOU. LET'S MOVE TO SENATOR GONZALEZ AS ASSEMBLY WOMAN QUIRK SILVA THAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO. THANK YOU SO MUCH I THINK EVERYTHING. I HAD QUESTIONS ON BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A SUCH A LINK THE MEETING HAS BEEN ANSWERED FOR THE MOST PART BUT JUST SOME TAKE AWAYS. JUST TO CLOSE THE LOOP ON ON EVERYTHING I KNOW A COUPLE OF US HAVE TO LEAVE SOON THANK YOU SO MUCH TO OUR CITY AUDITOR HOWELL AND TRUSTEE INTER CHANCELLOR AND OUR STUDENTS. LEADERSHIP THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST SOME TAKE AWAYS AS I. HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS AND OBSERVING. YOU KNOW SENATOR MINING AND I WERE RESPECTFULLY KIND OF BANTERING BACK AND FORTH THAT IF IT'S THIS COP COMPLICATED. FOR THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY TO GO BACK AND FORTH WITH NUMBERS I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW COMPLICATED IT COULD BE FOR FACULTY AND STUDENTS. AND SO IT IS JUST SOMETHING TO KIND OF RAISE UP BUT- FIRST AND FOREMOST AS WE AND I WAS CHECKING THROUGH THE TRUTH TOOL OF TRANSPARENCY. I'M A VERY VISUAL PERSON AND I KNOW A LOT OF STUDENTS ARE AS WELL. AND COMING FROM CITY GOVERNMENT WHERE WE PUT IN YOU KNOW AN ONLINE BUDGETING TOOL THAT YOU CAN KIND OF PLAY WITH. STUDENTS AND PARENTS AND FACULTY WANT TO KNOW WHERE THEIR DOLLARS ARE GOING. SO I KNOW THAT THERE'S A COMMITMENT ALREADY TO IMPROVE THAT TRANSPARENCY TOOL WHICH I WOULD HIGHLY IN. ENCOURAGING RECOMMEND ESPECIALLY. OUT OF THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS YOU'RE REMOVING FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND OUT OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION THAT IS TRUE RESERVES. YOU HAVE A FOR YOUR STRATEGY HORIZON IS WHAT I'M HEARING AS WELL. WHAT IS THAT STRATEGY HORIZON CONSIST OF AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE. THERE NEEDS TO BE IT ADDITIONAL DETAILS. SO PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IN WHERE THEIR THEIR MONEY IS GOING. THIRTY NOT ONLY FOR STUDENTS BUT PARENTS I HAVE A- A CHILD GOING TO THE CSU VERY SOON GOD HELP ME BUT- I'M REALLY EXCITED BUT I ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHERE MY DOLLARS ARE GOING. SECONDLY IN REGARDS TO THERE'S SORT OF TWO SORT OF. SOURCES OF REVENUE RIGHT TUITION AND THEN STUDENT FEES AND I KNOW THAT THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE SOMETIME AGO NOT TOO LONG AGO MAYBE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO WAS LOOKING AT STUDENT FEES AND- I JUST THINK THERE IS A COMMITMENT TO KIND OF LOOK AT THAT BUT IT IS INCONSISTENT IT RANGES ANYWHERE FROM A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE DOLLARS TO EIGHT HUNDRED FOURTEEN DOLLARS. SO WE KNOW THAT THOSE FEES SOMETIMES ARE ALL ALSO OBSCURE AND IT'S INCONSISTENT AS A MENTION ACROSS THE CS USE SO I JUST THINK THERE'S INCONGRUENCE THERE'S A ONE TIME TUITION INCREASE INCREASE BUT THEY'RE STILL STUDENT SUCCESS FEES THAT PEOPLE ARE ARE STILL WONDERING ABOUT. SO IS IT INCONGRUENT IN MESSAGING OVERALL AND THEN LASTLY I'M JUST REALLY HOPEFUL FROM THIS PANEL. BOTH FROM THE AUDIT IN THE FINDINGS. AND FROM THE CHANCELLOR WHITE THAT THERE IS A COMMITMENT TO CREATE A FIRM RESERVE POLICY WHICH IS GREAT. AND TO CREATE ADDITIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES WHICH IS WONDERFUL TASK FORCE THAT I WOULD HOPE. WHEN INCLUDING YOU KNOW THE STUDENT LEADERSHIP. BUT IT ALSO HELPS EMPLOYEES. PROVIDE THEM WITH A STARTING POINT FOR EMPLOYEE NEGOTIATIONS SMALL. AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS ALL BEEN SAID BUT I KIND OF HAVE TO CLOSE THE LOOP ON THIS AND I JUST REALLY WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING PARTNERS AND- I KNOW THAT WERE WERE CERTAINLY WATCHING BUT WE ALSO ARE VERY. MUCH COLLABORATORS IN THIS SENSE AS WELL SO THANKS AGAIN. THANK YOU WAS MOVED TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN QUIRK SILVA. WELL THANK YOU FOR SPENDING I THINK THE ENTIRE DAY WAITING FOR US TO GET HERE AND THEN ALSO THE THREE HOURS OF TESTIMONY AND- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY LIKES IN ON IT. AND OF COURSE OUR LEADER IN ON IT'S PROBABLY ISN'T THE POSTER CHILD FOR HAVING ALL KINDS OF THANK YOU LETTERS CENTER DEPARTMENT. BUT IF WE TAKE IT REALLY DOWN TO INDIVIDUALS WHICH WE ALL ARE AND WE ALL DO OUR TAXES EVERY YEAR AND I THINK. MOST OF US DON'T STAY UP NIGHTS WORRYING ABOUT ALL AUDIT BUT IF SOMEBODY WAS TO CALL IN. AND SAY IF WE'RE GOING AUDIT YOU FOR YOUR INDIVIDUAL TAXES IT WOULD BE A LOT OF STRESS. AND I THINK THAT AS I'VE NEVER BEEN AUDITED. THERE WOULD PROBABLY THINK BE THINGS THAT EVEN IN MY OWN PAPERWORK THAT I MIGHT HAVE SAID OKAY I WISH I WOULD HAVE DONE IT THIS WAY I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR. SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE BOTTOM LINE IS JUST THE CLARITY. THAT IF YOUR AN ACCOUNTANT IN YOUR IN THE WEEDS AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALKING ABOUT WAY DEEP IN THE BUDGET. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING MOST OF US ARE GOING TO BE PERUSING THROUGH. AND I THINK IT'S JUST. IN THIS. CLIMATE OF MOM MORE AND MORE TRANSPARENCY JUST HAVING SOME CLARITY OF BIG TAKEAWAYS AND SO I APPRECIATE. THAT YOU'VE SAID YOU'RE GONNA TAKES A OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. I DO APPRECIATE. THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF NUANCES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN REPORTED FOR WHERE DIFFERENT. ACCOUNTS WERE BUT THE CLARITY I THINK WOULD MAKE IT. MUCH EASIER. ONE OF THE REASONS THIS CAME UP FOR ME PARTICULARLY. IS YOU DO HAVE A ROBUST. LOBBYING GROUP COMING FROM ALL OF YOUR CALL IT IS MOST OF THE TIME TO THE STATE. AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE IN THIS US. THREE TIMES IN AS- I. STATED THE BEGINNING I HAVE CAL STATE FULLERTON LITERALLY IF. TWO MINUTES FROM MY HOUSE SO WE DO INTERACTIVE MEAN EITHER HAVE THE TOWN DOWN RELATIONSHIPS AND YOU HAVE. A LOT OF INTER MINGLING SO FOR EXAMPLE AT SOME COLLEGES LIKE FULLER TEN THERE'S NOT ONLY. JOINT USAGES BETWEEN PROPERTIES AND ALL PARKING THESE TYPE OF THINGS. BUT THERE'S ALSO AGREEMENTS MADE BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE UNIVERSITIES AND SO SOMETIMES THOSE AGREEMENTS GO ON AND ON AS YOU KNOW WITH. THE STADIUMS AND WHAT THE ARBORETUM'S AND ALL THAT I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT ANOTHER TIME. BUT I THE POINT OF THIS IS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF LONG TERM AGREEMENTS AND PEOPLE MOVE. FACULTY MOVES PRESIDENT'S MOVE. DIRECTORS MOVED AND SOMETIMES THIS INFORMATION CAN GET LOST OVER THE DECADES SO I THINK THE TRANSPARENCY I THINK MAKING SURE IT'S NOT JUST THE STUDENTS IS NOT JUST THE FACT OF THE WHERE THE BARGAINING UNITS BUT IT'S ALSO THE PARENTS. BECAUSE NOT ALL BUT MANY PARENTS ARE STILL DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO PLAN AND SUPPORT THEIR STUDENTS THROUGH COLLEGE SO. IT ISN'T JUST THE TUITION. WE ALSO KNOW IT'S THE HOUSING THE TEXT BOOKS ALL OF THESE OTHER COSTS BUT THE STUDENT FEES ARE SURPRISING LIKE I SAID. TWO SONS JUST GRADUATING IT WASN'T JUST THE TUITION IT WAS TO FIND OUT OKAY THAT ALONG WITH THE PARKING FEES REALLY ALMOST ADDS UP TO ANOTHER ALMOST TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. AT CAL STATE FULLERTON I KNOW IT'S DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT FOR A BUDGET YOU WANT TO BE AWARE OF THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT. THOSE ARE THE KIND OF EXTRA THINGS WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR AND THEN OF COURSE FOR YOUR STUDENTS LIKE TO DO. OTHER THINGS LIKE JOIN CLUBS AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THERE AND I THINK MOST PARENTS. GET THAT PRETTY MUCH ONCE THEY HAVE ONE GO THROUGH TO CALL. BUT I THINK FOR THE STUDENTS I WOULD SAY. A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THING. IS TO KNOW THAT WAY AND STUDENTS. ASK FOR A STUDENT FEE TO BE PLACED ON A AS A VOTE ON THEIR CAMPUS. THAT IT ISN'T JUST THE STUDENTS THAT ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THOSE ONE OR TWO YEARS THAT THERE MAY BE STUDENTS PAIN FOR A DECADE OR LONGER AND FOR SOME OF THE STUDENTS. THAT PLACE THAT THEY MAY HAVE ONE YEAR. OF IN JOIN LIKE THE TITANS CENTER THAT WAS JUST BUILT I THINK IT'S CALLED THAT. THE STUDENTS WHO PLACE THAT AND ADDED THAT FEE NOW EVERY STUDENT WHO COMES IN IS PAYING FOR THAT AND SO AS PARENTS. SO I'M NOT A SUPER SUPER FAN OF STUDENT FEES JUST BECAUSE THE STUDENTS DON'T ALWAYS REALIZE PLACING THAT FEE FOR ANOTHER DECADE OF STUDENTS AND SOMETIMES A VOTING TURNED OUT OF THAT SEE IS SO SMALL. IT'S LIKE OUR ELECTIONS WERE WE ONLY GET A SMALL ELECTION NOW FOR THE BONDS AND ALL THIS STUFF SO THAT'S A REAL BIG GLOBAL CONVERSATIONS ALL STOP WITH THAT BUT FEES ARE REALLY. THEY COST MONEY BOTTOM LINE SOMEBODY'S PAIN FOR THOSE AND BUT AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT EASY TO GO THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THIS. AND EVEN THOUGH I WAS THE ONE THAT ASKED FOR IT I HOPE YOU'LL STILL WELCOME ME TO YOUR CAMPUS BECAUSE I. YOU KNOW CAL STATE FULLERTON IN THE OTHER CAL STATE TO DO AN EXCELLENT JOB. AND MANY MANY OF US HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN AT CAL STATE AND IT ATTENDED. THAT'S THE TEACHER MADE THIRTY YEARS LOOK AT ALL THOSE HANDS. SO THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO THE AUDITOR AND HER TEAM BECAUSE- FROM WHAT I SEE YOU KNOW EXCELLENT WORK ON BOTH SIDES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT WILL MOVE TO SOMEONE OVER SANTIAGO. THANK YOU THINK MISTER AND VICE PRESIDENT THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING UP IN YOUR STRONG AT THE STICKY ADVOCACY FOR STUDENTS. AND CATHOLIC I APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE. FOR THE CSU AND I'M I'M A BIG FAN OF THE CSU. BUT BUT I WANT TO KIND OF GO BACK TO I THINK WHAT I UNDERSTOOD WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM US SACRAMENTO'S TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF. ONE TIME COST AND ONGOING COST WITH THE DIFFERENCES RIGHT BECAUSE I WANNA. I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I THINK I UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT OR IF NOT THEN I'LL TAKE THE SPIRIT OF WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM ME. AND HAVING THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE WITH WITH BUDGETS HAVING BEEN ON. THE PRESIDENT WILL LARGEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS SOMETIMES WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT ONE TIME COST IT WAS IT WAS ABOUT IT WAS ABOUT A VALUE STATEMENT TO THAT MEANS. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO EXPAND THIS ONE TIME BUT WE CAN ALSO MAKE A ONE TIME COST THOSE THINGS THAT WE TRY TO ACHIEVE OVER TIME. LIKE INVESTMENT STUDENT MIGHT INVESTMENT IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES LET LET LIKE LIKE INVESTMENT IN IN WORKING SO CERTAINLY WE DO COME BACK AN ADVOCATE FOR THOSE THINGS. I'LL BUT ALSO LET'S TALK ABOUT CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS AND NOT USING WHAT WE CALL A ONE TIME COST. OR A ONE TIME EXPENSE TO MAYBE NOT DO THAT THAT PIECE OF THE WORK. WHEN IT COMES TO THIS YES YOU WORK BECAUSE. I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR THAT CERTAIN THINGS ARE. OUR OPERATING COSTS AND THEY CAN EXTEND OVER ONE METER. I LIKE TO CHALLENGE YOU TO SAY OKAY WELL IF THIS IS A ONE TIME COST LET'S TALK ABOUT. THE TALK ABOUT LONG TERM LET'S LET'S LET'S MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO BE SINGLE YEAR. I'M KIND OF THE GUY I DON'T. I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT THERE'S A OF THE STAFF. AND SOME OF THEM ARE STILL IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS I WOULD HOPE THE BEST FOR THE CSU SYSTEM. AS IT GOES IN THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS THAT. IT DOES. ALL THE DATA THE CAN'T FOR STUDENTS. DOES ALL THAT CAN FOR TACKLE TO. AND IT DOES ALL THEY CAN. OFFER ALL THE OTHER EMPLOYEEGROUPS AND I'D LIKE TO. MAYBE GET YOUR TAKE ON THAT AND CERTAINLY IN THE WE'RE NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE THIS RIGHT HERE NOT EXPECTING THAT IT. AND I KNOW WE'VE HAD A COUPLE CONVERSATIONS BACK AND FORTH OVER THE YEARS BUT- BUT NOW THAT WE'RE HERE. LET'S TALK ABOUT ONGOING COSTS AND LET'S TALK ABOUT. VALUE THAT WE CALL ONE TURN ONE TIME COST INTO A LONGER TERM STRATEGY TO TRY TO. TRY TO SOLVE THAT ISSUE. WELL WE ARE GREAT WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE PREPARATION FOR THIS. NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR WERE ALL OF OUR CONTRACT COMMITMENTS TO OUR VALUED EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN FULLY FUNDED. WHEN WE GO WE'RE GOING INTO BARGAINING WE WILL. PURSUE THAT WITH THE IDEA OF TRYING TO RAISE OUR COMPENSATION FOR ALL EMPLOYEES. FAIRLY AND ADEQUATELY AND OF PARTICULAR CONCERN WITH THE LOWER INCOME A SO THE ENTRY LEVEL JOBS. BUT WE YOU KNOW THE WEEK WE HAVE TO HAVE A DEGREE OF. DISCIPLINE AND MISS BECAUSE WE MAKE COMMITMENTS TO EMPLOYEES SALARIES AND BENEFITS OUT OVER SAY THREE OR A FIVE YEAR CONTRACT. THAT FAR EXCEED. REVENUES IT WE'RE- THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE. THAT WE ARE PUTTING OURSELVES IN THE POSITION TO EITHER HAVE TO RENEGE ON THAT EVERYBODY CAN WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT YOU NEVER WANT TO DO OR TO DECREASE THE SIZE OF THE WORKFORCE AND NOT SERVE CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. SO WE ARE. WE ARE DISCIPLINED. IN OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ACTIVITIES WITH ALLY TO TAKING CARE OF OUR EMPLOYEES WHICH ARE THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE SCREEN INSTITUTION. BUT ALSO BEING FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE IN AS WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS. AND SO WE WILL NOT COMMIT. ONE TIME DOLLARS TO ONGOING EXPENSE THAT JUST SIMPLY IS A WAY IN WHICH IS NOT FISCALLY PRUDENT AND THIS IS SORT AGAINST OUR PRACTICE IN OUR VALUE SYSTEM. MR MAN PLEASE WELL LOOK I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I SAID BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAYBE PUSHED BACK A LITTLE BEEN SAY OKAY THEN THEN HOW DO YOU TURN THAT CONVERSATION INTO SAYING THAT THIS IS A VALUE THAT WE GO AFTER EVERY SINGLE YEAR SO IT'S NOT. SO THE WE'RE NOT HIDING BEHIND. THE SAYINGS THIS IS THE ONE TIME X. THESE ARE DOLLARS FOR ONE TIME EXPENDITURES NOT WANTING TO DO THE RIGHT THING WITH LONG TERM EXPENDITURES AND I'LL TELL YOU BECAUSE YOU GUYS FIERCELY DEBATED. WEBBER'S BILL I THINK IT WAS AB D. SIXTY NINE ON SALARY SCALES AND. CERTAINLY I THINK THAT WOULD IN A PATH TO THEIR. LOVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT OFFLINE BUT I BUT HOW DO YOU DO THAT RIGHT NOW WE GET TO THAT TO. WHAT I'M ASKING HERE. IN TERMS OF DOING THE RIGHT THING. WELL IN DOING THE RIGHT THING AS MANY. PERSPECTIVES ON A DOZEN MEMBERS SANTIAGO. WE CAN DEBATE. BUT BUT I WANNA RESPECTFULLY CHAIRS AND I KNOW THAT I CAN'T. CELEBRITY ON A TOPIC BUT- WE WILL NOT MAKE COMMITMENTS THAT WE DON'T FEEL WE HAVE THE RESOURCES OVER TIME TO PAY FOR IT WHEN WE COMMIT THE NOOSE BRINGING IN NEW STUDENTS SO WE'RE IN IN ROLLING THIS NEXT YEAR TEN THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS. WE HAD TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FACULTY AND SUPPORT STAFF OVER THE FOUR FIVE SIX YEARS THAT'S BOTH THE STUDENT IS GOING TO BE HERE AND SO WE DO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A LONG TERM HORIZON WHEN IT COMES TO SERVING OUR STUDENTS. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES WHICH IS THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROVIDED TO HAVE ADEQUATE NUMBERS OF FACULTY MORE PERMANENT FACULTY MORE FACTORED REPRESENT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR STUDENTS. AND SUPPORT STAFF SO THEY CAN SUCCEED. SO WE DO DO IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE COMMITMENTS IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IF WE DON'T SEE AN AVENUE TO HAVING THE FUNDING FOR THAT. NO ONE TAKE THE ENTIRE TIME BUT I BUT I THINK THAT ISSUE NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED IN AND A LEGAL TO. I JUST THINK THE TRAP THAT YOU WOULD FALL INTO IF YOU ARE USING ONE TIME REVENUES FOR. ONGOING COSTS IS THE ONCE WE USE UP THOSE ONE TIME REVENUES IN THE SYSTEM. WE'LL BE BACK HERE. TALKING TO YOU ABOUT BACK FILLING WITH AN INCREASED APPROPRIATIONS. OKAY HAVE BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARGAIN TABLE I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO PUSH BACK AND GET LET'S TALK ABOUT WILL PEOPLE MAKE. YEAH AND THEN I'LL BE DONE AND I DON'T WANT I KNOW THAT A YOU KNOW THE D. SOMEONE RESPECT FOR THE CHAIR BUT I MEAN IF WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. WELL THEY'LL BE DONE THE COLLECTIBLE. SOUNDS LIKE ANOTHER HEARING. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER SANTIAGO WE GET THE POINT I THINK. THE UNIVERSITY UNDERSTANDS WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM AS WELL BUT THOSE ARE. CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS I KNOW WE CONTINUE TO HAVE EVEN IN THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES AS WELL. AS WE DISCUSSES MOVING FORWARD INTO THE UPCOMING BUDGET YEARS. BUT WITH THAT LET ME GO AHEAD AND- WE SHOULD ASKS A VERY QUICK QUESTIONS ARE DEFINITELY VERY LONG ANSWERS JUST BASED OFF OF THE TESTIMONY FOR THE EARLIER PANEL BUT ALSO QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS SO ONE WAS A WAS A LACK OF. A RESERVE POLICY AT CSU WHAT THE MONEY IS USED FOR TO AS THE AUTHORITY FOR SPENDING THAT MONEY THE MONEY AND THE PARAMETERS YOU KNOW AROUND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CS USE. LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT MOVING FORWARD BASED OFF THE AYE. WE ACCEPT ALL THE ON ITS RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE MORE GOV GRANULARITY IN THE DETAILS AROUND OUR RESERVES. AND NOW DOES THAT INCLUDE A SHOULD WE EXPECT A YEARLY REPORT TO THE TRUSTEES AS WELL AND PERHAPS EVEN THE STUDENTS ASSOCIATION JUST HOW THAT BREAKS DOWN SO THAT THERE'S MORE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IT WILL BE IN ALL OF OUR ANNUAL REPORTS. IT HAS BEEN OR ANYA REPORTS BUT IS GOING TO BE MORE GRANULAR CAL DEFINITIONS SPREADING IT OUT. OKAY AND THEN IN TERMS OF. THE PARKING HI THIS IS A BE A BIG CONCERN OF THE STUDENTS. SHOULD WE ANTICIPATE MORE ROBUST TRANSPORTATION PLANS ARE PROGRAMS THAT KIND OF OUTLINE HOW WE'RE ADDRESSING. THE PARKING YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER INCREASING ENROLLMENT SIZE FOR INSTANCE HOW DOES THAT CORRELATE WITH PARKING IN PARKING SPACES BECAUSE IT'LL CONTINUE TO PROBABLY BE A HEADACHE FOR STUDENTS. IN A REVIEW OF CAMPUS PARKING REQUESTS WILL FALL THE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A DEEP AND ADEQUATE DIVE ON ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION. OPPORTUNITIES AND COSTS AND REVENUES TO SUPPORT THAT. BEFORE IT GETS CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE APPROVAL REPORT TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT ALL RIGHT WITH THAT LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT LET ME ASK THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AN ALLEY ANYTHING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO. SAY BEFORE WE CONCLUDE WITH THE CSU AS WELL. THIS ONE LAST A COMMENT ON WE'RE TALKING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. THERE'S INCLUDED INCLUDED IN A RECOMMENDATION IS FOR YES YOU TO. DISCLOSE TO THE LEGISLATURE THE AMOUNT OF JUSTIFICATION FOR AND SAFE CARS OVER FUNDS. AT THAT CSU TEAM TO RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY JUST WANTED TO MAKE THE POINT THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A KEY JOB OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEES A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SENT. OKAY LOOKING AT THE JUSTIFICATION FOR AND THEN DECIDING IN WAYNE IN. DO DOES THE LEGISLATURE AGREE WITH THAT DOES THE LEGISLATURE AGREE WITH WHAT SEE ISSUES PROPOSING TO BE ITS ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY RESERVE. SHOULD THERE EVEN BE A RESERVE. FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY GIVEN THAT THE STATE HAS. ITS OWN RESERVE. THOSE DISCUSSIONS NEED TO. BE MADE I'M BE HAD AT. THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT DETERMINE THAT. THAT WHAT THE CSU HASN'T RESERVES AND WHAT IT HAS DESIGNATED IN RESERVES IS JUST ABOUT EXACTLY RIGHT. YOU THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT COME TO THAT CONCLUSION YOU MIGHT DECIDE THAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU WE JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION THINK THROUGH IT. WILL BE AS PART OF OUR JOB BE GLAD TO HELP YOU THINK THROUGH THAT SO THAT YOU CAN WEIGH IN AND DECIDE IF YOU AGREE OR NOT WITH WHAT CSU PROPOSES TO DO ON RESERVES GOING FORWARD. GOT IT AND I APPRECIATE AND WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE FEEDBACK FROM THE LA I KNOW WE- VALUE THAT OPINION ESPECIALLY AS WE START. GOING THROUGH THE BUDGET IN MAKING THOSE DIFFERENT ALLOCATIONS BECAUSE ONE THING IS UNDERSTANDING THE NUMBERS BUT ANOTHER THING IS ALSO UNDERSTANDING THE POLICY AROUND THOSE NUMBERS AND- MOVING FORWARD WHETHER IT'S ONE TIME COSTS ARE ON GOING COST SIR. TACKLING CAPITAL COST TO. HOPEFULLY ONGOING COST TO DEAL WITH WHETHER IT'S RETENTION OR. SALARIES LIKE MISTER. SANTIAGO. CONSUMERS ALSO TO ADD ONE MORE SORT OF CAMEO TWO IS ALSO THE CONTEXT RIGHT. THE MULTI YEAR CONTEXT IN SO YOU SEE YOU ONE INTERPRETATION IF YOU START LOOKING AT. DATA ACCESS TO DATE WHY. DID YOU GO ON BACK ONE MORE YEAR STARTED ONE YEAR LATER YOU GET A TOTALLY. SUPPORT OF THE- OPERATIONS OF A UNIVERSITY WAS. MULTI YOUR COMMITMENTS TO STUDENTS IS THAT. IT ENDS IF WE COULD EVER MOVE TO MORE OF A MULTI YEAR FUNDING AGREEMENT. THE STATE FOR A- THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A HUGE STEP FORWARD RATHER THIS ANNUAL PROCESS OF. AND NOT FINDING OUT UNTIL. JUNE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE APPROPRIATIONS GONNA BE STARTING ON JULY RIGHT. SO I THINK THERE IS PROBABLY SOME. OPPORTUNITY. DRIVEN BY AN AUDIT OF US IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE PAST WHERE CAN WE SOMEHOW CREATE THE BUDGET CONVERSATIONS TO BE MULTI YEAR. TO TRY AND GET RID OF THIS INEVITABLE AT THE FLOOR. IT'S A HARD THING TO DO AN ANNUAL BUDGETING PROCESS PRACTICAL BE WORTHY I THINK I THINK IT'S VERY GOOD JUST TOO I THINK. WE CREATE A LOT OF ANGST ON THE CAMPUSES IN THIS HUGE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM BECAUSE EVERY JANUARY WE BEGIN THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO WE BEGIN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT TUITION INCREASES. SO EVEN THOUGH WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE THE LAST EIGHT YEARS ALL EIGHT YEARS WE'VE GOT EVERYBODY ALL RILED UP BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A MULTI YEAR APPROACH TO THE SYSTEM. AND THAT MAKES IT VERY UNSUSTAINABLE FINANCIALLY LONG TERM. YEAH NO I UNDERSTAND THOSE ANXIETIES BUT AT THE SAME TOKEN I KNOW. AND WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN INCREASING AND BEEN VERY GOOD AT CSU. LAST SIX YEARS. SO I KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH WE'RE NOT IN A MULTI YEAR BUDGETING CYCLE WE DO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS EVERY YEAR WITH THE GOVERNOR AS WELL. LEADERSHIP OVER THE CENTER IN THE ASSEMBLY BUT I KNOW FOR THE REQUEST OF THE CSU AS- BUT BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE KNOW THE LEGISLATURE'S RESPONDED. FAVORABLY OVER THE LAST SIX I BELIEVE SIX BUDGET CYCLES NOW. WHAT VERSION GRATEFUL FOR. OKAY WITH THAT WE WILL CONCLUDE THIS PANEL WE WILL MOVE ON. WILL MOVE ON NOW TO YOU PUBLIC COMMENTS I GET HAVE EVERYONE PLEASE LINE UP. YEAH NOW IF YOU COULD LIST YOUR NAME THE ORGANIZATION YOU'RE WITH OR PERHAPS IF YOU'RE NOT WITH AN ORGANIZATION PROBABLY WHICH COUNTY YOU LIVE IN IF YOU KEEP YOUR COMMENTS SEEING WE APPRECIATE THAT IT'S BEEN A LONG HERE AGAIN PROCEDURE GUYS WAITING. AND STICKING IT OUT WITH US AS WELL SO WITH THAT IF YOU COULD PLEASE LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS LESSON TWO MINUTES. WE APPRECIATE THAT. PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS CAPTAIN HUTCHINSON I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR FINANCE REPRESENTING THIS ISSUE EMPLOYEES UNION. AS THE ISSUE YOU SPONSORED THE STATE AUDIT OF THIS ISSUES OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS AND PARKING PROGRAM. AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHARON QUIRK SILVA WHO ASKED FOR THE AUDIT. AND THE AUDIT ALSO WOULD NOT EXIST IF NOT FOR THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEES UNANIMOUS APPROVAL OF IT. AND THAT THEIR WORK DONE BY STATE AUDITOR L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G HOW AND HER&lt;/c&gt; STAFF. UNFORTUNATELY THE OF HIS CONCLUSIONS WERE NOT A TOTAL SURPRISE THE FIRST ONE OF THIS ISSUE ON ACCOUNTS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND LATER LEARNED THAT CAMPUS IS FOR BUILDING PARKING STRUCTURES WITHOUT FIRST CONSIDERING LESS COSTLY ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS AS A CAR BY STATE LAW AND SEE ISSUE POLICY. WHEN WE PRESENTED OUR FINDINGS TO THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES SHOWING. THERE ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MEAN HOW TO SEE ISSUE ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE STATE TREASURY THE TRUSTEES REACTED WITH DISCIPLINE. NOW THAT THE US RELEASE CONFIRMS OUR UNIONS PREVIOUS ASSERTIONS TO SEE ISSUE SPEARHEADING A PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN TO DENY ANY WRONGDOING. CLAIMING THIS ISSUE IS A VICTIM OF MISLEADING RESPONSIBLE TAX. THIS ISSUE NOT COME IN THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SERVICES NEVER HIDDEN MONEY BUT IN FACT WAS THE RESULT OF PRUDENT PLANNING. TO MEET SEE SHE'S REDUCE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES WHAT CHANCE A RIGHT NOW CLAIMS THE SURPLUS IS A HEDGE AGAINST ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY THE FACTS FOR VOTE OTHERWISE. STAY AUDIT SHOWED THAT DURING THE TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. DURING ONE OF THE WORST ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS IN OUR STATE HISTORY THIS ISSUE ACTUALLY INCREASE THE BOUNCE OF ITS OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS BY SIX HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION. THIS IS A DIRECT RESULT OF INCREASES IN THE SKIN TUITION AND REDUCE SPENDING THROUGH APART FROM. IN LAYOFFS. DESTRUCTION ACCOUNT HAS BEEN A CREAM FUNDS THIS YEAR'S YOU HAS BEEN HOARDING MONEY AND NOT SPENDING THE FUNDS GIVEN TO THEM BY THE LEGISLATURE SPENT IN EACH FISCAL YEAR. AS STATED BY ASSEMBLY REPORTS OF OTHER PARTIES WERE BLACK AND WHITE IN THE OR SEE WHAT LIKE. ONE HAVE BILLION DOLLARS IS JUST SITTING IN OUTSIDE COUNTS IS WARMING. THESE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED THE STUDENTS FIFTY SEMESTER SEMESTER LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN FUNDS TO SUPPORT THIS EACH YOU EACH YEAR AND THE FUNDS ARE NOT FULLY EXPENDED BY THE SEA ISSUE. FOR EXAMPLE WHY HAVEN'T ESSENTIAL STAND PROGRAMS FOR MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELLING AND FEED IN SECURITIES BEEN FUNDED. WHY TWENTY THOUSAND SEAT SHE SUPPORT STOCK BEING UNDERPAID AND OVERWORKED TWELVE AND THAT NUMBER IS A MEASURE OF POSITIONS KEEP INCREASING ALONG WITH THEIR SALARIES. AS ISSUES TOP ADMINISTRATOR CHESTER WHITES REPEATED AND- REPEATED FINGER POINTING WON'T CHANGE THE CONCLUSIONS I'VE NEVER STATE AUDITS. THAT SHOW THAT THIS ISSUE BUDGET LACKS MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYEES WHO SUPPORT THE ECONOMICS OPERATIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY AND ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENTS WE SERVE WE ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ENACT MEASURES. THAT WILL PREVENT FUTURE MISUSE OF STATE FUNDS AND INTUITION. AND WE ARE DUE TO TAKE AFFIRMATIVE STEPS TO REPAIR AND RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF THIS ISSUE. WE APPRECIATE YOUR ENGAGEMENT TODAY'S HEARING THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHAT'S PROCEED. ARREST ABOUT MOMENTARILY BUT I WILL BE BACK IN A FEW OMENTS.

DIDN'T DISCLOSE IT JUST THAT GAVE A VAGUE RESPONSE AND SAME WITH THE CHANCELLOR. AND AS FAR AS LEGALITIES ARE INVOLVED THEY HAVE VIOLATED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTY TO DISCLOSE IT AT THAT BOARD MEETING AND. IN SUMMARY I'M VERY VERY. I'VE I HAVE REALLY THINK THAT THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. HAVE OVERSTEPPED THEIR BOUNDS IN ATTACKING THE STATE AUDITOR'S INTEGRITY IF YOU SEE THE AUDIT COMMITTEE MEETING THEY- THEY WORSE CLAIMING THAT SHE WAS LYING IN THAT ASPECT BUT SHE REALLY DID NOT.

NOT ONLY GOES TO THE INSTITUTION THE STUDENTS BUT ALSO TO LIFT OUR WORKERS ARE CLASSIFIED WORKERS OUT OF POVERTY WAGES AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR FACULTY ARE SUFFER ALL APPROPRIATELY COMPENSATED FOR THE WORK THEY DO IN THE DEDICATION NICER TO THE CSU. THANK YOU. THE NATIONAL CUB PUBLIC COMMENT HI I'M JENNIFER EGAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION AND FACULTY MEMBER CAL STATE EAST BAY I'M YOU IT REALLY SHOULD BE UP SETTING NOT JUST TO THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM BUT REALLY TO AT ALL CALIFORNIANS THAT THE CSU ADMINISTRATION. INCREASED ITS RESERVES DURING THE RECESSION BY CUTTING CLASSES INITIATING FURLOUGHS AND LAYING OFF EMPLOYEES WHAT AND RAISING TUITION STUDENT TUITION AT THE SAME TIME I WAS A DEPARTMENT CHAIR AT THE SAME TIME AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER AND I REMEMBER IT WELL. THAT IS WHY THIS THE EFFORTS CFA HAS ADVOCATED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT FOR THE CSU AND OUR LATEST INCARNATION IN THOSE EFFORTS IS OUR SPONSORED BILL AB NINE THIRTY THESE KINDS OF AT EFFORTS FOR TRANSPARENCY. AND GREATER OVERSIGHT OF THIS YES YOU WERE DEEPLY NECESSARY. SAYING THAT I WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT DESPITE THE AUDIT FINDINGS THE STATE BUDGET STILL UNDER FUNDS THE CSU RELATIVE TO THE SUPPORT. IT PROVIDED THIRTY YEARS AGO AND THAT PRE DATES THE RECESSION. EVEN WITH THIS YEAR'S LANDMARK BUDGET TENS OF THOUSANDS OF POTENTIAL STUDENTS WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE CSU. AND STUDENTS ARE TAKING ON MORE AND MORE DEBT. WE MUST CONTINUE TO CONTINUE TO REINVEST IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE. OF THE LEGISLATURE TO NOT LET THE CS USE IRRESPONSIBLE OR QUESTIONABLE ACCOUNTING ENDING UP HURTING STUDENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD EVENING MARIO GUERRERO ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION AND ALSO AS I TO FACULTY AT SACRAMENTO STATE I WANTED TO POINT OUT A COUPLE THINGS FIRST I FOUND IT TROUBLING. THAT THERE WAS MENTION OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET. THAT WAS ALLOCATED TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT IN THE CSU THAT WAS A ONE TIME FUNDING FOR SHORE BUT THE INTENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO HAVE ONE COHORT. OF STUDENTS FOR FOUR YEARS A TIME THE CSU WHAT WE JUST HEARD IN TESTIMONY WAS THAT THAT MONEY WAS ACTUALLY PLACED INTO. ONE OF THESE ACCOUNTS I LIKE YOU ALL HAD A HARD TIME FIGURING OUT WHICH ONE WAS WHICH BUT THESE RESERVES OR OTHERWISE ACCOUNTS MEANING IT WASN'T SPENT. ON THE INTENT WHICH WAS ENROLLMENT SO FOUND THAT EXTREMELY CONCERNING HOPEFULLY SOME OF YOU CAUGHT THAT AND MIGHT BE AN AYE AYE SOMETHING LOOK INTO FURTHER. SECOND JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT TO THAT AS ARE A POLITICAL ACTION CHAIR JUST MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE FOUGHT FOR A LOT OF FOR ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF SOME NUMBER BAR CONS. FEE AUDIT THAT WE ARE REALLY APPRECIATE J. LOCK UP APPROVING. RELATED TO THAT. PARKING LIKE I MENTION THAT BECAUSE THE CFA HAS EXTREME SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS THE PARKING BILL WAS ACTUALLY SOMETHING WE SUPPORTED. HOWEVER IT PITTED FACULTY AGAIN STUDENTS AND STUDENTS AGAIN FACULTY WE BELIEVE THERE'S A STRUCTURAL ISSUE THAT DOESN'T ALLOW THE CSU TO PAY ITS PORTION OF THAT ON BEHALF OF FACULTY BECAUSE FOR FACULTY IT'S A BENEFIT AND FOR STUDENTS. IT'S A SERVICE SO WE HOPE TO WORK WITH YOU TO SOLVE THAT ISSUE THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. HI MY NAME IS PICKING THE CLOUD AND I'VE BEEN EMPLOYED WITH THE C. ISSUE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS I WANT TO THANK YOU TODAY TO HAVE THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. I REMEMBER THE CSU BUDGET OPERATED UNDER FORMULAS THAT DETERMINE HOW MANY ADMINISTRATORS FACULTY AND SUPPORT STAFF WERE NEEDED TO ADEQUATELY STAFFED CLASSES AND STUDENT SERVICES. NOW IT SEEMS THE STATE GIVES A C. ISSUE MONEY AND TRUST IT WILL BE SPENT APPROPRIATELY. I HOPE THIS HEARING TODAY RESULTS IN BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND CSU FINANCES ALSO TODAY IT WAS BROUGHT UP. ON COMMUNICATION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATION BY THE STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE ON ALSO THE CHANCELLOR. TO ADD A STAFF REPRESENTATIVE TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES BECAUSE THERE IS NONE AND THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE OPEN COMMUNICATION AS WELL THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD EVENING EVERYONE MY NAME'S CRYSTAL AND EVERY DAY AND I'M SITTING BY PRESIDENT SACRAMENTO STATE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I STAND IN SUPPORT WITH. VICE PRESIDENT MEETINGS STATEMENTS EARLIER TODAY. ABOUT PARKING INEQUITIES THAT DO EXIST ON OUR CAMPUS. STUDENTS TO PAY MORE FOR PARKING. TWO IT TO JUST PARK ON THE SEA IN THE SAME STRUCTURES SMALLER PARKING SPOTS. AND IN JUST LAST AVAILABLE PLACES THEN THE FACULTY DO FACULTY GET THEIR PARKING ON CAMPUS AND THEY HAVE WAY NICER PARKING. THE PARKING IS JUST THAT'S JUST THE TRUTH I'M SORRY LIKE. SO I SUPPORTERS STATEMENT AT THING IS NOT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION. NOT ALL COMMUNITIES PROVIDE YOU KNOW VERY DEVELOPED METHODS OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO ADDRESS. THE CSU SERVES STUDENTS THAT ARE FIRST GENERATION. THERE ARE LOW INCOME. AND THAT ARE UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES LIKE MYSELF. AND I JUST ASK DOT YOU KEEP THAT IN MIND. WHEN CONCLUDING WITH FINDINGS OF THE AUDIT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU MY NAME IS JESSICA WEST BAY I WORK AT CSU CHICO AND PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS SERVICES I'M TROUBLED BY WHAT I READ IN THE STATE AUDIT BUT I'M EVEN MORE TROUBLED AFTER HEARING TODAY'S TESTIMONY. ESPECIALLY THE DENIAL AND BLAME EXPRESSED BY CS USE LEADERSHIP. I ENCOURAGE CHANCELLOR WAY TO RECESSES RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT AND RE PRIORITIZE THE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE UNMET NEEDS OF BOTH THE STUDENTS AND THE STAFF. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK MY NAME IS KATE COMO I'VE BEEN A FAMILY PHYSICIAN AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE STUDENT HEALTH SERVICE FOR THE LAST ELEVEN AND A HALF YEARS. AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE UNITED THE EXCUSE ME IS A MEMBER OF THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS. ARE THIS EVENING WE DID HEAR SOME COMMENTS ABOUT STUDENT HEALTH AND TO MENTAL HEALTH WHICH OF COURSE. I AM EXTREMELY. CONCERNED ABOUT WELL THE CSU ACCUMULATED THIS LARGE SURPLUS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS DIRECT SERVICES TO STUDENTS RATIONALLY REDUCED. THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS AT THE CSU CAMPUS CLINICS FELL FROM TWO HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED PHYSICIANS DUE TO A LACK OF ADEQUATE FUNDING. AT OUR CAMPUS ARE STEVEN ACTS USING OUR PHYSICIAN STAFFING HAS DROPPED FROM NINE TO FOUR POINT FIVE JUST FOUR POINT FIVE PHYSICIANS FOR THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. EVEN THOUGH OUR ENROLLMENT REMAINED UNCHANGED. MEANWHILE THE NEED FOR ACCESSIBLE ON CAMPUS MEDICAL CARE HAS INCREASED DUE TO MANY FACTORS INCLUDING MORE STUDENTS LIVING ON CAMPUS MORE STUDENTS. COMING FROM OUTSIDE OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. NOT HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE REQUIRED FOR CSU STUDENTS AND INCREASED MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. SO ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE IS MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER BEFORE. HOW WOULD ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR STUDENT HEALTH HELP WE COULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS UP TO THE LEVEL WE HAD BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. WE CAN EXPAND THE SERVICES THAT WE COULD PROVIDE AND WE COULD BETTER ADDRESS. MEDICAL EMERGENCIES BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND OF LARGE SCALE INCLUDING HEALTH ISSUES THAT OCCURRED WITH THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES FOR EXAMPLE. AND WE COULD ALSO BETTER UP ADDRESS POSSIBLE OUTBREAKS THAT OCCUR ON COLLEGES CAMPUS COLLEGE CAMPUSES INCLUDING CHICKEN POX MENINGITIS AND MEASLES. BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE BACKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR STUDENT HEALTH WE COULD INCREASE PHYSICIAN'S SALARIES TO INCREASE OUR STAFFING AND THEREBY THE STATE COULD HELP ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SUCCESS OF CSU STUDENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU CHEN MEMBERS ADRIN MOHAMMED WITH THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS OP MEAL ASKED ME LOCAL TWO OH SIX I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE PREVIOUS POINTS BUT I DO WANNA SO SAY IT MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF DOCTOR DOMINO AND JUST CHALLENGE YOU ALL TO THINK ABOUT THE INTERSECTION OLOGY OF HAVING THIS KIND OF MONEY NOT GO DIRECTLY TO STUDENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS THAT THE CSU SYSTEM SERVES AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY WENT SPECIAL WE LOOK AT THE NORTHERN COAST AND- RURAL CALIFORNIA AND THE PEOPLE THAT COME FROM THOSE. COMMUNITIES AND WHAT THIS MEANS WHEN WE ARE NOT PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO STUDENTHEALTH CARE AND WHAT THAT MEANS WHEN THEY GO BACK HOME OR WHEN THEY GO INTO THE WORKING WORLD RIGHT AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE THIS IS ADVOCACY THAT CAN BE IMPROVED VERY EASILY AND SO WE IMPLORE YOU ALL TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO HELP GET US THERE AND WE ARE WORKING IN WILLING PARTNERS WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. THE OVER TO REGRET THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMIC PROFESSIONAL SO CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THE ADVISORS. COMES WASN'T RECORDED SO THAT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. TEN YEARS AGO WE APPROVED A CONTRACT WITH THIS ISSUE. UNDER THEIR ADVICE AND LEADERSHIP TELLING US THAT THERE WAS NO MONEY THAT UNIVERSITY WAS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE. AND BECAUSE OF THAT MANY OF OUR MEMBERS LOST THEIR HOMES LOST THEIR CREDIT. AND IN A AND DO IT UNTOLD HARDSHIP. I'M ASKING YOU NOT TO ALLOW THEM TO DO THE SAME TO YOU AS THEY DID TO US TEN YEARS AGO. WHICH IS TO PULL THE WOOL OVER YOUR EYES. AND LED TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO MONEY. THAT THEY HAVE NO FUNDING. BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE IT AND THEY HAD IT TEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE-EN MASSE. IN GOOD FAITH APPROVED A CONTRACT. AND ALLOWED HIM TO. LEAD US DOWN THE GARDEN PATH. SO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING. AND I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO BE TAKING YOUR- LOW YOUR ROLE OF OVERSEEING THIS YEAR'S WHO SERIOUSLY BECAUSE- THEY REALLY NEED TO BE. LET IN THEY NEED TO THEY NEED TO THE UP THE OVERSIGHT NECESSARY. TO GUIDE US ALL THROUGH. HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. HELLO PATRICK CHOI ON PRESIDENT OF ACTING IMPRESSIONS OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK WANNA AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU SEE SO MANY REPRESENTED STAFF HERE IS ALONG WITH THE JILL DOWN HOPEFULLY OF ALL THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN THE TRANSPARENCY EFFECTS THE MINE BUT BOTH TO CHESTER RIGHT DOWN TO THE CAMPUS PRESENCE AND TO THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. IS THAT IT IS A MAJOR CONCERN BECAUSE. WERE THESE DISCRETIONARY MONIES ARE COMING FROM OUR SOMETIMES IT CAN BE LABELED AS SALARY SAVINGS WELL WHY HASN'T BEEN REALLY SPOKEN THAT. DO WE KNOW THAT FROM A DEPARTMENT LEVEL DEPARTMENT LEVEL DEAN'S LEVEL ARE AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL IS THERE A CONSCIOUS EFFORT FOR SALARY SAVINGS WHICH- MAKES OUR ADDS TO THE SO CALLED SURPLUSES SO THAT'S BEING UNSPOKEN THAT NOT ONLY DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE'S LESS MANY POTENTIALLY TO HIRE STAFF TO FILL THE POSITIONS. BUT ALSO FOR THE CURRENT STAFF THAT ARE LEFT PRESIDENT WITHOUT THE I'M FILL POSITIONS WE ARE WORKING HARDER FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF PAY SO PLEASE KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOUR- ADDRESSING THE AUDIT FINDINGS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. HERE MY NAME IS KIM HARRINGTON AND I AM A RETIREE THIRTY THREE YEARS SAID THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND I'M NOT GOING TO BELABOR ANY OF THIS I'M JUST GOING TO ASK THE QUESTION. WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU USE THOSE FUNDS TO DEAL WITH FOOD AND SECURITIES. FOR HOUSING IN SECURITIES. ONE TIME FUNDS RIGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE BUT HOW DOESHOW DO ONE TIME FUNDS OVER TEN YEARS TURN INTO ONE POINT FIVE OR ONE POINT EIGHT PICK THE BILLIONS. OUR STUDENTS I MEAN MY DEPARTMENT HIRED STUDENTS. AND STUDENTS WHO WERE WORKING MORE AND MORE HOURS RIGHT TO COVER FEES THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO COVER. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO RAISE TUITION. THOSE FUNDS WERE GIVEN TO YOU TO SUPPORT STUDENTS THE OPERATION ITSELF. SO IT IT FEELS LIKE IT HAS FELT LIKE A MANUFACTURED CRISIS. AND THAT'S THAT'S SAT. WE'VE HAD THREE SUCCESSIVE AUDITS. MANAGEMENT GROWTH HEALTH AND SAFETY AND NOW THIS. YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY YOU HAD MONEY TO START DEALING WITH THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN YOU SICK CERTAINLY THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OF THE STAFF. AND I'M SORRY I'M SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING TO YOU BUT- HE'S OUR CHANCELLOR. UNDERSINK ABOUT IT WHEN YOU WALKED THREE YEARS AGO TWO YEARS AGO SENATOR ROBB. YOU MENTIONED IN THAT HEALTH AND SAFETY HEARING THAT WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A GAP ANALYSIS. WHY AREN'T YOU WALL LOOKING AT THE WORK FORCE NEEDS TO THE CSU HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING EXPENDED. BECAUSE THIS IS A MESS. THANK YOU THANK YOU NATIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. HEY THANKS FOR ALL STAY IN HANGING OUT LISTENING MANAGERS GOTTEN FROM FRESNO STATE IN THE FACILITY CONTROL SPECIALIST AND WITH THE TEAMSTERS TWENTY TEN THE TEAMSTERS UNDERSTAND CSU MUST PRIORITIZE THE BUDGET. AND BUDGET THEIR MONEY EVERY YEAR IN ACCORDANCE WITH HOW MUCH FUNDING THEY RECEIVED FROM THE. STATE HOWEVER THE CSU ALWAYS FINDS. ALWAYS FINDS WAYS TO FUND THEIR PRIORITIES RACISM FURNACE TO EMPLOYEES ARE RARELY A PRIORITY. THE FACT THAT SEE ISSUE HAS MONEY SQUIRRELED AWAY IN LITTLE KNOWN OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS SOLIDIFIES OUR POSITION THAT THE CSU HAS THE MONEY TO REINSTATE SALARY STEPS FOR THE CSU EMPLOYEES WELL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALLOCATES LESS MONEY. TO THE CSU THIS YEAR DUE TO THIS NEWLY DISCOVERED MONEY MAKES NO DIFFERENCE OUR FOCUS ON PASSING AB THREE SIXTY NINE TO REINSTATE SALARY STEPS REMAINS TOP PRIORITY FOR OUR UNION. AND THE CSU WORKERS THE OTHER THING THAT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS MRS HOWLS. ALL THE AND THEN THAT AUDIT ON PAGE EIGHT. EIGHT OF SIXTY FOUR THE PDF FILE. SHE MAKES A STATEMENT HOWEVER BECAUSE CSU IS EXEMPT FROM BUDGET REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD MAKE IT NECESSARY TO TRACK SALARY SAVINGS SOME CAMPUSES HAD LIMITED INFORMATION ABOUT THE SALARY SAVINGS. BUT YET NOTHING WAS STATED HERE. ABOUT THAT AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES WHATEVER IT HAS TO DO TO STOP THIS YES YOU FROM HAVING THAT EXEMPTION SO THAT THIS MONEY IS TRACKED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT AT THIS TIME WE ASK IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. HEARING AND SEEING NINE I'LL TURN IT BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE DíAS. LET ME ASK FREDDIE THE ONE AS ANY CONCLUDING REMARKS IF NOT I WILL GIVE SOME CONCLUDING REMARKS HEARING AND SEEING NONE. FIRST OFF LET ME JUST THANK EVERYONE FOR STICKING IT OUT IT'S- SEVEN FORTY RIGHT NOW SUFFICIENT EVERYONE ONE WAITING FOR A SORT OF FLOOR SESSION TO FINISH SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN. BUT I ALSO LIKE TO THANK. ALL MY COLLEAGUES I THINK YOU SAW A LOT OF INTEREST HERE. FROM BOTH HOUSES BOTH PARTIES WE HAD AB. THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE THE ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE TWO ON EDUCATION FINANCE WE HAVE OUR CHAIR OF BUDGET HERE WE HAD A NUMBER OF SHARES ACTUALLY. IN THIS HEARING AND I THINK IT. JUST SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE. OF WANTING TO BRING TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. SO THAT WE'RE ALL MAKING POLICY DECISIONS WE DO TO MAKE MOVING FORWARD WITH A SPECIAL. EMPHASIS ON STUDENTS ON FACULTY ON THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE SO THAT IT CONTINUES TO FUNCTION I DO APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE THE WORK THAT WAS DONE PUTTING ALL THE WORK PUT INTO THE AUDIT THE LA FOR THEIR CLARIFYING REMARKS IN THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE AS WELL WE ALSO HEARD FROM THE CSU THANK YOU GUYS FOR BEING HERE AND FOR LISTENING TO THE PUBLIC COMMENTS AS WELL. AND FROM THE STUDENT THECAL STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AS WELL. I THINK MOVING FORWARD ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO DO AND THESE WILL CONTINUE TO BE DISCUSSIONS AS ONE DOING THE CHECK IN WITH THE OSCAR. AND THE REPORT AS IT CONTINUES TO SEC BEGINS TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. I KNOW THERE WAS. SOME DISCREPANCY ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS A- SURPLUS OR A RESERVE OR WHETHER IT WAS HIT IN OR TRANSPARENT. I THINK MOVING FORWARD I THINK WE'VE- EVERYONE AGREED WITH INCREASED TRANSPARENCY. INCREASED THE DEFINITIONS ON THE PARAMETERS AND I BELIEVE I HEARD THE CHANCELLOR EVEN SAY HE AGREED WITH. THE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND SO AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD LIKE I KNOW I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THOSE BEING IMPLEMENTED AND WILL BE PAYING. ATTENTION TO THOSE CHECK INS WITH THE AUDITOR WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW THAT STAND OUT WITH THAT I DO WANNA LIST EACH OF THE MEMBERS THAT WERE HERE JUST TO HAVE IT ON RECORD I'D LIKE TO THINK SAID IN A MINING FOR STAYING THE ENTIRE TIME SENATOR ROTH FOR BEING HERE CENTER MORLOCK.
