CRITICALLY ALTHOUGH METROLINK ANOTHER PASSENGER RAIL YARD HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE POLLUTION COMING FROM LOCOMOTIVES AND I THINK THE STATE SHOULD ENCOURAGE ZERO EMISSION LOCOMOTIVES AND- RAIL ELECTRIFICATION. WHICH IS COMMON ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR THE VERY HEAVY FREIGHT TRAINS IN SOME PLACES JUST NOT IN NORTH AMERICA. AND CLOSE TO A THIRD OF THE BORDER VALLEY LONG BEACH- FREE MAYBE AROUND 25% OF HOLD OUT BY RAIL. AND I THINK THAT MODES SHOULD INCREASE THE OF THE SHARE OF THE RAIL BUDGET INCREASE TO GET TRUCKS OFF THE FREEWAY WITH INCLUDING SHORT HAUL RAIL THE INLAND EMPIRE. HAD THAT ONE THIRD.

FIVE EIGHTY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. HI VERY PROUD PRESENT FIVE EIGHTY A BILL THAT SEEKS TO. MITIGATE THE STATE'S ON RECYCLED PLASTIC SURPLUS. BY ASKING THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION TO CONDUCT THE STUDY ASSESSING THE VISIBLE FEASIBILITY. COST EFFECTIVENESS AND LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS INCLUDING RECYCLED PLASTICS THE NATIONAL PRODUCTION FOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR PROJECTS. IN TWENTY ELEVEN WE AT THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE GOAL OF 75% RESPONSE RECYCLING BY TWENTY TWENTY. BUT NOW WE ARE VERY VERY FAR FROM THAT GOAL. ACCORDING TO CAL RECYCLE DISPOSAL TONNAGES HAVE BEEN INCREASING YEAR AFTER YEAR IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA'S DISPOSED. OF FORTY SIX POINT THREE MILLION TONS. THE SIX YEARLY INCREASE IN A ROW L. E. P. A. REPORTED THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ONLY THREE MILLION TONS OR EIGHT POINT SEVEN PERCENT. OF THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF PLASTICS WERE RECYCLED. MEANWHILE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF PLASTICS COMBUSTED IN MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS FIVE POINT SIX MILLION TONS. ALMOST THE SAME AMOUNT. THIS WAS A SIXTEEN POINT THREE INCREASE ALL MSW COMBUSTED. WITH ENERGY RECOVERY THAT YEAR FURTHERMORE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT LANDFILLS RECEIVED TWENTY SEVEN MILLION TONS OF PLASTIC THIS WAS EIGHTEEN POINT 5% OF ALL MSW LANDFILL. IN ORDER TO MEET THE GOALS WE SET FOR OURSELVES WE MUST FIND INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS ONE OF OUR STATE'S MOST PRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES RESEARCH FROM AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING NEW USES FOR RECYCLED PLASTICS. AND IN THE LAST DECADE WE HAVE SEEN THE BENEFIT OF USING RECYCLED PLASTIC AS AN ASPHALT ADDITIVE. IN TWENTY TWELVE VANCOUVER CANADA REPORTED THAT THEY WOULD BE RE INCORPORATING THE USE OF BLUE BLOCKS BLUE BOX PLASTIC WASTE AS AN ASPHALT WAX ADDITIVE FOR ROAD REPAIR IN TWENTY FIFTEEN ROTTERDAM NETHERLANDS ANNOUNCED THEIR PLAN TO FACTORY PRODUCED RECYCLE PLASTICS SEGMENTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ROAD CONSTRUCTION. MORE RECENTLY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO ANNOUNCED THAT THEY PARTNERED WITH THE PLASTIC ROAD DEVELOPER TO ENGINEER THE FIRST KNOWN ROAD IN THE UNITED STATES. USING RECYCLED PLASTIC ASPHALT MIX. AS MOST OF YOU KNOW USING RECYCLED MATERIALS AS AN ADDITIVE FOR US FULL PRODUCTION ISN'T A NEW CONCEPT TO US HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE CALIFORNIA HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED. A COMPREHENSIVE TIRE RECYCLING AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. AND USES THOSE RECYCLED TIRES TO CREATE RUBBERIZED ASPHALT CONCRETE. AS A LEADER IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES CALIFORNIA IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO TRANSFORM THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY ONCE AGAIN BY INTRODUCING NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY WE LOOK AT RECYCLED PLASTIC THIS BILL. WE ARE SEEING IN THIS BILL WE ARE SEEKING TO EXPAND ON CURRENT STATES EFFORTS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE COST OF ROAD CONSTRUCTION. AN INCREASE THE STRENGTH AND DURABILITY OF OUR ROADS. ALL THE WHILE FINDING ALTERNATIVE USES FOR WASTE PLASTIC OTHERWISE DESTINED FOR LANDFILL. THE IDEA OF THIS BILL SEARCHES ORIGINATED BY A GROUP OF ENGAGE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN MY DISTRICT VERY PROUD OF THEM AND I THINK THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL IDEA AND I THOUGHT THAT I CHAMPION THIS CAUSE IN ORDER TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. RECYCLE PLASTIC IMPROVE THE DURABILITY OF OUR ROADS AND SAVE TAXPAYERS MONEY AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION WILL BE WORKING WITH THEM TO ENSURE THAT SB FIVE EIGHTY P. ISN'T PERCEIVED AS A LONG TERM SOLUTION BUT RATHER A NECESSARY STEP TO REACHING STATES RECYCLING GOALS. AND I HAVE SOME WITNESSES. ARE OUR FIRST WITNESSES PRICE SCARED HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE BENITO HIGH PROGRESSIVE CLUB. FOLLOWED BY REBEKAH SPARKS HE'S A CHIEF OPERATIONS OFFICER. FOR MACGRUBER.

AS WE MET WITH THE SENATOR- WE WERE TASKED WITH ANSWERING ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING QUESTIONS OUR GENERATION FACES TODAY. HOW CAN WE MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLEAN UP OUR OCEANS ALL WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPROVING CONDITIONS FOR ALL PEOPLE. OUR ANSWER IS TO INNOVATE CALIFORNIA'S ROAD CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY USING RECYCLED PLASTICS. WE BEGAN OUR RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT RESEARCHERS BASED OUT OF THE U. K. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON TECHNOLOGY THAT USES RECYCLED PLASTIC AS AN ADDITIVE FOR ASPHALT PRODUCTION IN ROADS. AND AFTER SEEING IN THIS RESEARCH WE THOUGHT WHY IS IN CALIFORNIA. NOT DOING THIS ALREADY. CALIFORNIA BEING FIFTH LARGEST TO IN THE WORLD HAS THE DUTY TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE AND TO INSPIRE OTHERS TO MAKE POSITIVE CHANGE. SB FIVE EIGHTY IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SPARK THAT CHANGE BY TURNING OUR PLASTIC WASTE INTO A RESOURCE. WITH THE HELP OF SENATOR HUESO IS OFFICE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TURN THIS SIMPLE IDEA INTO A POLICY THAT WILL IMPACT MIND AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. AND I INVITE YOU TO ASK YOURSELF THIS IF A GROUP OF HIGH SCHOOL AND THE KIDS ARE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING AS TRANSFORMATIVE AS THIS. AND WHAT COULD PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD YOURSELVES AND THE ENTIRETY OF OUR STATE ACCOMPLISH. I AM BUT YOU TO FIND THE ANSWER ALONG SIDE ME BY PASSING SENATE BILL FIVE EIGHTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU PRICE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- NEXT MODERATOR WILL MOVE TO MR BECCA SPARKS. NUMBER TWO YOU CAN EXPECT. AUSTIN POLICE TO RESORT. MISFORTUNE LINE IS OPEN. YEAH BEEN ABLE TO TURN THIS WHY DO. MISS PARKER YOU IN THE. PLEASE START ORGANISED PARKS YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU CAN EVERYBODY HEAR ME. YES WE CAN'T. YES THANK YOU CHAIRWOMAN GONZALEZ AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE EIGHTY. MY NAME IS REBECCA PARK AND I AM THE CHIEF OPERATIONS OFFICER AT A CREEPER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE PLASTIC WHAT COMPANY. I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE IN OUR ECONOMY AND MY YES IT IS MANY DETRIMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS THE SAME ATTRIBUTES MAKE IT A GREAT PERFORMANCE ENHANCER IN ATHOL. OUR CHECKING OF DEMONSTRATED THAT PLASTIC ASPHALT REDUCES THE FORMATION AND WRITING FAILURES AS WELL AS INCREASES FRACTURE TOUGHNESS IN SHORT PLASTIC ASPHALT WILL LAST LONGER THAN CONVENTIONAL ASPHALT. THE PLASTIC WE USE HAS BEEN SELECTED AFTER YEARS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELPMENT. IT IS A POLYMER MODIFIER THE ONES THAT IS INCORPORATED INTO CONVENTIONAL ASPHALT. IT IS A THREE MONTH EXTENSION OF THE BATMAN ALREADY PRESENT IN THE MIX. I THINK APPLE OUTPERFORMED CONVENTIONAL ASPHALT NOT ONLY IN THE LAB BUT IN THE FIELD. INDEPENDENT TESTING CONFIRMING IT DOES NOT HAVE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. DOES NOT CHANGE THE RECYCLABILITY OF ASPHALT WHEN IT IS AT THE END OF THE SERVICE LIFE. HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ADDED TO CONVENTIONAL ASPHALT CONTENT RETAINING UP 240% RAP. AND HAD HEROES CHANGES TO THE INSTALLATION PROCESS. ANY PAVING COMPANY CAN INSTALL CLASSIC ASPHALT IN EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER THEY WOULD INSTALL CONVENTIONAL ASPHALT. I WOULD LAST WE TAKE LIKE TO TAKE THE TOP. TO AND- I FIVE EIGHTY IT'S BEEN ASK THAT WE STUDY. IN ASPHALT IT IS NOT ASKING TO CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT THE PATIENTS AT THE PRESENT TIME. WE HAD A GREBER BELIEVE IN SCIENCE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THAT TO ITS CONSTITUENTS TO INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY WHAT THINK REMEMBER THAT ARE ALREADY SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN TO BE TRUE. I THINK APPLE IS GOOD FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN DO TO PROVIDE REFERENCE. ON YOUR LAST WROTE. I'M SORRY WHAT WAS THAT I'M SORRY IF YOU CAN JUST WRAP UP YOUR TESTIMONY HERE AT TWO MINUTES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOUR AND HAS YOUR WRITING CAN'T. ONE BIT LAST- A PROVIDE FOR STRONGER LONGER LASTING ROADS. IT'D COST COMPARED. TO CONVENTIONAL ASPHALT. THANK YOU THIRDS FINITE NATURAL RESOURCES AND EVERY TIME A BIT. OFF THAT. PLASTIC WASTE FOOTPRINT. I ASK YOU TO PLEASE MOVE FORWARD WITH SB FIVE EIGHTY. AND HELP CALIFORNIA BE A LEADER IN FIGHTING THE WAY CLASSIC EPIDEMIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GONZALEZ THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS NORRLAND BREAK REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASPHALT PAVEMENT ASSOCIATION A TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OUR CONSTRUCTION BUILDERS WE MUST ARM RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF THE KNOWLEDGE ON RIDLEY AND BELIEVE CALTRANS APPROPRIATE AGENCY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXECUTION ONE THIRTY IN THE BILL COMPLETED WE'VE HEARD THE BELL UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO DELETE A REFERENCE TO PAYMENT THE CATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH AUTHORS OFTEN. ON A RESOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT COMMENT. NO OTHER LINES INTO THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MODERATOR LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE CONCLUDED SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WITNESSES- LET'S BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS I SEE SENATOR NEWMAN. HERBICIDE CENTER WHICH I JUST WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON THIS BILL AND I WANT TO COMPLIMENT PRICE- AND THE ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE BENITO VISTA HIGH SCHOOL PROGRESSIVE CLUB AND THE GREEN CLUB. GREEN TEAM. THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY INSPIRING AND SO KUDOS TO YOU FOR ENGAGING THESE VERY SMART YOUNG PEOPLE. AND IT WOULD SEEM WE ARE THE BEGINNINGS OF A REALLY INTERESTING APPROACH TO A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM. WRAPS IT THANK YOU- THAT THIS IS YOU'VE MADE MY DAY THAT AND I RESPECTFULLY SB DATA CO AUTHORED SOME POINT IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. GREAT THANK YOU SAN NEWMAN SENT MEN. CENTER WHAT- ALLEN. THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO FOR INTERVIEWS IN THIS BILL IT'S A VERY INNOVATIVE IDEA- I JUST HAD A COUPLE CONCERNS I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT- YOU KNOW I'M NOT A SCIENTIST OBVIOUSLY BUT I AS A- WE START TO LEARN ABOUT THE POTENTIALLY. DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS OF MICROPLASTICS ON OUR HEALTH- YEAH ACT MAYBE I'M MISSING SOMETHING BUT DID DID THIS PARTICULAR BILL CALL FOR ANY PUBLIC HEALTH EVALUATION OR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AS PART OF THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY OF CALTRANS. OKAY WELL THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO- GET A HOLD OF ALL THAT INFORMATION IN A CONVERSATION WITH SENATOR ALAN- WE TALKED ABOUT INCORPORATING THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL IN THE STUDY TO MAKE SURE. THAT THAT THAT IS LOOKED AT AS WELL AND I. I SUPPORT THAT VERY VERY MUCH I THINK THAT'S- A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT. OF THIS TECHNOLOGY- BEAR IN MIND THAT- OF COURSE THIS AND THIS ELEMENT. COMPLETELY INCORPORATES INTO THE ASPHALT SO. IF YOU IF YOU CONSIDER THE POT PETROLEUM IS AN INGREDIENT LIST BASICALLY STRENGTHENS PROBLEMS SO. IT REALLY IT DISSOLVES INTO THE ASPHALT THAT'S WHY I FEEL IT'S A VERY SAFE. ADDITIVE TO- TO **** THAT WOULD NOT POSE A HAZARD SO I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE. ABOUT INCORPORATING THAT INTO THAT I MEAN FIRST OF ALL WE DON'T WANT TO ADD. TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT WITH THIS IS A WHOLE EFFORT TO. CLEAN THE ENVIRONMENT IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT KEEP PLASTICS OUT OF THE ENVIRONMENT IF YOU CONSIDER HOW MUCH WE'RE FAILING. IN OUR IN OUR CURRENT EFFORTS TO KEEP PLASTICS OF THE ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND IF THIS ELEMENT. CAN HELP US THAT. AND WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO REPLACE ONE CONTAMINANT WITH ANOTHER WITH THIS BILL. WE'RE LOOKING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AND I REALLY AM LOOKING FOR IS A TRULY. INFORMATIVE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES SO I WILL BE WORKING WITH SENATOR ALAN CHIN IN CORPORATE ATTACHED AS PROOF BILL MOVES FORWARD. TO MAKE SURE WE CAPTURE THAT IN THE STUDY AS WELL. THANK YOU THAT ACTUALLY SWITCHES OVER MY CONCERNS AND IF IT IS A SAFE YOU SAID I YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THIS WOULD BE. A GOOD WAY TO USE SOME OF THE- CLASSICS THAT WERE I CURRENTLY WE'RE NOT RECYCLING AND ALSO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT ASPECT OF THIS- BUT I DO THINK JUST EMPHASIZE IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO ACTUALLY EXPLICITLY INCLUDE THAT- ASPECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL BEYOND BECAUSE HAVING EXPERTS. GO AN INDETERMINATE WHETHER THERE'S A RISK OF RUNOFF FROM THE ASPHALT OR NOT- WHETHER IT POSES ANY THREATS TO. OUR HEALTH I THINK THAT MAKES ME MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE WILLING TO MANDATE TO INCORPORATE THOSE FACTORS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- THANK YOU SENATOR. MEN SENATOR ALAN. ONE TO TAKE MY CAR SENATOR AND I'M TO THANK YOU. MISS CENTER WESO FOR YOUR FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US ON THIS I YEAH AYE. I THINK. I HEARD YOUR- THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL AND DOES CERTAIN. AND YOU KNOW I WANT TO GIVE YOU FOR TRYING TO COME UP WITH A OF. A CREATIVE SOLUTION FOR- FOR FREE AND USES OF. PLASTICS AND- I THINK THAT THE TWO THIRDS TO KIKKAN. THAT ARE OUT THERE- YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM IS. TIED THAT MICROPLASTICS ARE REAL PROBLEM AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT WILL. CONTRIBUTE TO A FOR LIVE AT EVER INCREASING AMOUNT OF MICROPLASTICS OUT IN THE- IN THE IN A WATER STREAM. AND SO THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THE OCEANPROTECTION COUNCIL WHICH WOULD WOULD LOOK AT. AND I ALSO THINK THEY WOULD THEY WOULD YOU KNOW THE OTHER ISSUE I JUST WANNA I WANNA REYES. IS MAKING SURE THAT THIS REALLY DOES MEET YOUR GOALS OF TRYING TO.ENCOURAGE RECYCLING. AND AND- YEAH GOOD DOWNSTREAM USES- THE WE DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT WILL ACT RESUME AND I PRESUME I WOULD. YEAH I PRESUME YOU WOULD AGREE TO THIS- CENTER WESO. I THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT WILL ACTUALLY. MAKE IT LESS LIKELY FOR- FOR HOW HE WAS. PLASTICS TO BE TURNED INTO. SOMETHING AND THAT THERE WOULD BE A HIGHER AND BETTER USE. THAN A ROAD SO. YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU MOVING FORWARD I THINK I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR WILLINGNESS TO INCLUDE THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL IN THIS ANALYSIS I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL. ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVE- ALONG WITH CALTRANS. AND TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AT PLAY HERE I ALSO RECOGNIZE IT'S A STUDY IN THIS IS JUST AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO. TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S A GOOD PATH MOVING FORWARD THAT WILL. BOTH HELP US WITH REGARDS TO ROADS INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALSO. WITH REGARDS TO. REDUCING PLASTICS POLLUTION IN WITH THAT- SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND WITH THAT AND IN THAT SPIRIT IN WITHOUT AGREEMENT I'M I'M SO HAPPY TO. SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK. YOU SENATOR ALAN SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ONE OF CREATE THE CAR. OF MY ARE. TWO PREVIOUS COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE. IN BUT ALSO APPRECIATE SENATOR HUESO IS- RAISING OF THIS ISSUE THAT. WE DO HAVE. A WAY TOO MANY PLASTICS AND- WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RECYCLE THEM. FOR MANY MANY REASONS I WON'T GET INTO NOW. SO WE DO NEED TO. ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND OF COURSE THE REDUCTION IN THE USE OF PLASTICS WOULD BE THE FIRST AND FOREMOST- HOWEVER THAT'S OBVIOUSLY OTHER BILLS THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER BUT WHAT I WANT TO RAISE IS SIMILAR TO MY COLLEAGUES THE CONCERN AROUND MICROPLASTICS. AND WHILE I DO NOT OPPOSE THE USE OF PLASTICS AND ROADS AND WILL SUPPORT THE BILL THE STUDY THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW HAS CALTRANS LOOKING AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF THE USE AND WHAT MY CONCERN IS BY THAT DEFINITION ALONE THEY MAY NOT INCLUDE IN THEIR STUDY. WHAT POSSIBLE- DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS MAY BE THE REASON I RAISE IT IS. WE KNOW NOW THAT WILL JUST WITHOUT EVEN IT'S OBVIOUS THAT NGUYEN TIRES RUN ON ROADS THE FRICTION BETWEEN THE TIRE AND THE ROADS BREAKS UP THE ROAD. BUT WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS THAT THEY LOOK GOOD PERCENT OF PARTICULATE MATTER. IN CALIFORNIA IS IN OUR AREA THAT AFFECTS OUR WHICH IS PART OF THE- COMPONENT OF SMOG. SO IN PARTICULAR MATTER IS ONE OF THE DANGEROUS HEALTHWISE COMPONENTS OF SMART THAT A GOOD PORTION OF THAT PARTICULAR MATTER COMES FROM JUST TIRES RUNNING ON ROADWAYS BREAKING UP BOTH THE TIRES IN THE ROADWAY. OUR MICROPLASTICS ALREADY ARE FEATURED IN ALL OF THIS THE THERE WERE GRAD STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA THE PUBLISHED A STUDY JUST LAST AUGUST AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY. WHERE THEY SAMPLED A LARGE ARRAY AND VERY PEOPLE IT PASSED AWAY OF- HUMAN ORGANS. AND THEY FOUND THEY DETECTED MICROPLASTICS IN EVERY ORGAN FOR EVERY. HUMAN THAT DAY. START THERE WAS 1100% SO MICROPLASTICS NOW ARE QUITE UBIQUITOUS WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE LONG TERM HEALTH IMPACTS OF THEM AND IF THE USE OF THEM USED PLASTICS IN ROADWAYS WORD BECAUSE MORE MICROPLASTICS TO BECOME AIRBORNE THAT COULD BE A SERIOUS ISSUE. SO WHAT I WOULD APPRECIATE IS HAPPENING. WITHIN THE STUDY THAT THEY ALSO LOOK AT WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT POSSIBLE DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS THERE MIGHT BE. BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY YOU CAN LOOK AT WHETHER THEY'RE VIABLE FOR. THE YOU KNOW STRUCTURE AND STRENGTH OF ROADWAY BUT I THINK IT ALSO SHOULD LOOK AT THAT ASPECT. AND HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR WITH AGREE WITH- ADDING SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER SENATOR- WHAT'S THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES. YES FOR NOW OKAY ABSOLUTELY SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I ALSO WANT TO COMMIT THE AUTHOR NOT ONLY FOR. BEING INNOVATIVE BUT TAKING THE STUDENTS ADVICE I WAS ALSO STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT TINA IS A FORMER EDUCATOR I'M ALWAYS ENCOURAGE WHEN WE GET OUR YOUTH INVOLVED SELF. SILVA THANK YOU FOR TO THE STUDENTS WHO REALLY TAKE THIS INITIATIVE AND- INTO THE GREAT CENTER FROM SAN DIEGO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I DO HAVE. SOME CONCERNS JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE BUT I THINK THAT THROUGH THE DISCUSSION IT SATISFIED SOME OF THE CONCERNS- YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL INVOLVED ALONG WITH CALTRANS. I JUST THINK THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO STUDY SOMETHING AND SEE IF THIS HAS ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS LONG TERM. I THINK THAT THROUGH THE STATE HE WILL FIND OUT IF IT'S FEASIBLE OR NOT AND THEN MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND ALSO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO SENATOR BAKER. THANK YOU MANAGER. ASSEMBLY LOVES INNOVATIVE IDEAS I COMMEND STUDENTS AND- APPRECIATE THE- THE TEND TO STUDY AND DO YOU PLAN TO SUPPORT THIS I JUST DID ONE ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS MY COLLEAGUES AROUND MICROPLASTICS IS SOMETHING I'VE RECENTLY BECOME AWARE OF AND FOCUSED ON AS WELL AS THE ISSUE OF YOU KNOW THE EFFECTS THE FACTS ON PLASTIC RECYCLING GENERALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THE HIGHLY RECYCLABLE PLASTICS YOU END UP. IN THERE- IN IN THEIR BEST USE- BUT WITH THE YOU KNOW HEALTH CONCERNS NOTED HERE TODAY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOUNG. THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER I SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND SENATOR WESSEL THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL- WE ALL SHARED. SIMILAR CONCERNS I KNOW YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK- WITH- THAT THE SENATORS WHO RAISES CONCERNS AND OF COURSE WITH THE APPROPRIATE ORGANIZATION SO GO RIGHT AHEAD AND CLOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS FOR THEIR ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS BILL. INCLUDING STAFF AT- YOU KNOW AS I'M SURROUNDED HERE BY PLASTIC. AND MANY OF YOU ARE SURROUNDED BY PLASTIC. IN THIS MEETING IT'S REALLY HARD TO. ENGAGE ANY PART OF OUR COMMUNITY WITHOUT A COMING- INTO FIRSTHAND. A CONTACT WITH PLASTIC IN ALMOST EVERY PART OF OUR LIVES PLASTIC IS REALLY BECOME. JUST A LOW COST. INGREDIENT IN IN IN THE- BILL FORMING. FURNITURE AND- WINDOWS THE CONSTRUCTION- MATERIALS BOTTLES. PLASTIC WARE. I MEAN IT'S JUST SO MUCH PART OF OUR- LIVES EVERY DAY THAT IT JUST IS GETTING IS SEEN SINCE SEEING THE GROUP GROW MORE AS OPPOSED REDUCE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO PRACTICALLY DO YOU DEAL WITH PRACTICALLY. CANCEL THIS BILL I THINK IS A IS A VERY PRACTICAL APPROACH TO REMOVE THIS MATERIAL FROM THE ENVIRONMENT FROM OUR LANDFILLS. A GROUP OF YOU KNOW WHAT A CONTINUING PROBLEM CALIFORNIA'S BECAUSE THE GROWING NEED FOR LANDFILLS WE NEED TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR CATALAN FEELS WE NEED TO RECYCLE MORE BUT WE NEED A PLACE TO PUT PLASTIC IS RECYCLED MATERIAL. AND AS THE WORLD DEVELOPMENTS USED TECHNOLOGIES IN DIFFERENT AREAS CALIFORNIA STILL STRUGGLING WITH MORE WORK WHERE TO PUT OUR CLASSROOM MATERIALS. BUT I. I BELIEVE THAT- IN IN CONDUCTING A TUDY IT AND NEEDS TO BE TRULY SCIENTIFIC IS IT NEEDS TO BE TRULY INFORMATIVE. AND I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO MAKE SURE THE STUDY IS. INFORMATIVE IT IS- HELPFUL IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE USE OF THIS PLASTIC MATERIAL ON OUR ROADWAYS IS GOING TO BE. THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE WHAT IS CRAP CURRENTLY OF A GROWING- SURPLUS OF SOURCE OF MATERIAL THAT'S CAUSING LOTS AND LOTS OF PROBLEMS WORLDWIDE SO CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LIKE TAKE TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN FINDING NEW WAYS TO PUT PLASTIC MATERIALS IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR LIVES THIS BILL HAS LANGUAGE OF SAYS AS AS WE BEGIN THE RECYCLED MATERIAL THAT WE DON'T REALLY GET INTO THIS- YOU KNOW NECESSARILY CREATING A DEMAND THAT WILL. REALLY REQUIRE THE PRODUCTION OF PLASTIC MATERIAL WE DON'T WANT TO GET TO THAT LEVEL EITHER WERE WERE PRODUCING PLASTIC MATERIAL INTENTIONALLY. TO FEEL. THE ROAD PRODUCTION AND NOT ON THE CONTRARY IT IS REALLY BEING USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO DUMPING THIS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. AND- TO PROLIFERATE FOR PROLIFERATING WASTE AN APARTMENT SIZE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU SENATOR WEST OF DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON SB FIVE EIGHTY. SENATOR NEWMAN. SENATOR NEWMAN IS ENTERTAIN THAT THE MOTION- MISTER CHIEF CONSULTANT CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. THE DALLAS FIVE.

WHICH IS- SB TWO ONE TWO SEVEN. BY SENATOR JONES WELCOME SENATOR JONES. WE'VE HEARD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER HAD THE BILL OF THE DAY BEFORE SO I APPRECIATE THAT- THAT CREATES QUITE A- STANDARD TO REACH. THANK YOU A MANAGER FIRST OF ALL I THINK YOU. ARE YOUR STAFF AND LOOK I THINK EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE'VE HAD VERY POSITIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH- I'M VERY EXCITED TO PRESENT THIS BILL AGAIN. SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER IT FROM LAST YEAR BUT SENATE BILL TWO TWENTY SEVEN CREATES A VERY NARROW. TAILORED REGISTRATION PROGRAM FOR COMPETITION OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES. MOSTLY MOTORCYCLES. THIS BILL IS A RE INTRODUCTION OF MY BILL FROM LAST YEAR S. B. TEN TWENTY FOUR WHICH ACTUALLY PASSEDTHE SENATE TRANSPORTATION. AND OFF THE SENATE FLOOR LAST YEAR ON CONSENT. BILL PASSED OFF THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AT MIDNIGHT ON THE LAST EVENING. AND UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT HAVE TIME TO GET BACK TO THE SENATE FOR CONCURRENCE FOR FINAL VOTE. OR WE WOULD'VE BEEN DONE WITH THIS- LAST YEAR. I'M RUNNING THIS ILL BECAUSE OF ITS GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND TO THE ENTIRE STATE CURRENTLY COMPETITION OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES ARE REGISTERED TO CARDS REGISTER PROGRAM. TWO YEARS AGO KARBI CITED THE END IS REGISTER PROGRAM AS OF THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND WITHOUT A NEW PROGRAM- WHICH BE COMPETITIONS AND THE PRACTICE WRITING WILL BE PUT TO AN END ON CALIFORNIA LANDS. ADDITIONALLY LOCAL ECONOMIES THAT RELY ON THE SUPPORT WOULD BE DECIMATED. BY A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR REVENUE LOSS. IN ORDER TO SAVE A BELOVED SPORT WITH A LONG HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA THIS BILL CREATES REPLACEMENT REGISTRATION PROGRAM. UNDER THE PARKS DEPARTMENT. MY OFFICE HAS BEEN OVER A YEAR WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING H. B. COMPETITION ARCHITECT OR HIS ASIAN. OHB MANUFACTURERS AND SEVERAL STATE AGENCIES WHICH ALL OF YOU CAN- TESTIFY TO. HOW MUCH WORK THAT IS BUT- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH ALL OF THE AGENCIES AND GET A MOVING IN A IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION ON THIS. AND ALTHOUGH- WE'VE I AM AWARE THAT THERE IS SOME- ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONSWITH THOSE ORGANIZATIONS. AND MITIGATE THEIR CONCERNS TO THE BEST ABILITY THAT WE CAN- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING MEEINGS WITH THOSE THE FACT THAT THIS BILL IS AND SO NARROWLY TAILORED. IT WILL ACTUALLY ELIMINATE AN ESTIMATED 93% OF NEW COMPETITION VEHICLES NINETY THREE PERCENT. BASICALLY THE NUMBERS A CARD GIVES US THE REDUCTION IN REGISTERED VEHICLES WILL DROP FROM SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR. TO ONLY FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR. AND SO- WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT POSITIVE CHANGE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA. MADAM CHAIR WITH THAT I HAVE TO WITNESSES ON THE LINE READY TO GIVE EXPERT TESTIMONY. AND I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE A CALLERS- CALLING IN AS WELL IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR JONES- AND I THINK WE HAVE ONE LEAD WITNESS WHO IS ACTUALLY HERE IN A CHAMBERS AS WELL I BELIEVE THAT MIGHT BE JIM LOMBARDO SENIOR. OKAY GREAT MISTER LOMBARDO PLEASE COME FORWARD CALIFORNIA MOTORCYCLE DEALERS ASSOCIATION YOU'LL BE GIVEN TWO MINUTES- SPEAKING SUPPORT. OKAY. DO WITH. LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN FOR MR LOMBARD L. OKAY YOU SHOULD BE GOOD MISTER BETTER PLEASE PROCEED. I DON'T THINK WE CAN HEAR HIM STILL. I FIND THAT I COULD FOLLOW THERE YOU GO. NOW THE REAR THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIRMAN MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JAMES EMBARKED ON THE AFT CALIFORNIA MOTORCYCLE DEALERS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING SOME FOUR HUNDRED MOTORCYCLE DEALERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. VERY SMALL BUSINESSES WHERE MOM AND POP OWNED INDIVIDUALLY OWNED THERE'S A SMALL THAT YOU PROBABLY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THEY ARE IN YOUR DISTRICT THAT THEY ARE IN YOUR DISTRICT- WE WERE HIT VERY STRONGLY BY THE COBIT. OKAY SO MANY OF OUR DEALERSHIPS FOR CLOSE UP TO SIX MONTHS WITH NO BUSINESS. THAN WE WERE LIMITED TO. TO PASS A TEN CUSTOMERS PER. VISIT AND SO WE HAVE A SERIOUS IMPACT ON US- I REMEMBER GOING TO LAS VEGAS. AND STOPPING WHEN TIME AND BUFFALO BILLS THERE AND STATE LINE AND THERE WERE SOME. OF GO KARTS OUT THERE IN THE PARKING LOT GOING AROUND I SAID WHAT ARE THESE FOR. NAY SAID THESE PEOPLE ARE PRACTICING TO BECOME FORMULA ONE DRIVERS BAPTISTS PRACTICING PRACTICING GO UP THE LADDER. SO THEY CAN COMPETE THE LONG BEACH GRAND PRIX FURTHER THE GOODNESS SAKE. OUR WRITERS HAVE THAT SAME KNEE. THEY JUST DON'T AREN'T ABLE TO JUST ENTER EVENTS. TODAY BY MULTIPLE MOTORCYCLES. THE AVERAGE MOTORCYCLES FOR OFF ROAD IS TWELVE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND YOU BY BACKUP TIRES EQUIPMENT AND EVERYTHING ELSE WHEN YOU'RE TRAVELING SO IF YOU. HAVE A BREAK DOWN YOU HAVE A SPARE BIKE YOU CAN REPAIR THESE VEHICLES. WE ESTIMATE THAT. AT A LOSS OF TWENTY FIVE FOUR SEVEN NINE DOLLARS TO THE MEMBERS. DEALERS IN THE SALES. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT. FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HURT SO BAD. THAT YOU COULD PASS THIS BILL WE CAN WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I'M IN ROUTE TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE HOPEFULLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR LOMBARDO FOR BEING HERE- THE NEXT WITNESS LEAD WITNESS IN SUPPORT.

OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH STAYING ABROAD ON BEHALF OF THEIR CLUB CALIFORNIA AND ARE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS. STATEWIDE IN OPPOSITION TO SB. YOUR TWO SEVEN- WHICH WOULD UNNECESSARILY ALLOW FOR THE CONTINUED USE OF HIGHLY POLLUTING OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES ON PUBLIC LANDS COMPROMISING CALIFORNIA AIR QUALITY. PUBLIC HEALTH SCHOOLS THE BILL UNNECESSARILY OVERRIDE. AN EXISTING CARD POLICY. YOU WILL LIMIT THE- HIGHLY POLLUTING- I WOULD BE A GOLD. THEIR OFFICE TIMES ONE AND A HALF TO TWO ANDA HALF TIME MORE. THE CARD ENDED- THE RED STICKER PROGRAM DAY ESTIMATED. THAT THERE BE A REDUCTION UP SIX TIMES. PER DAY. AND BY TWENTY FOUR.

MINDER FOUR THREE FOUR YOUR LINE OPEN. WARNING GONZALEZ AND MEMBERS BILL MCGOVERN WITH COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR REGRETFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO S. B. TWO TWO SEVEN THE RED STICKER PROGRAM BECAME A MUCH BIGGER LOOPHOLE. AND IT REALLY WAS ENVISIONED TO BE AND SO CARVE THROUGH A REGULATORY PROCESS THAT WAS OPEN TO ALL THE INTERESTED% PARTIES. BECAUSE THAT WILL CALL DOOR NARROWED IT WHILE STILL ALLOWING FOR COMPETITION MOTORCYCLES TO BE USE SO ARE WE DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO DISTURB THAT BALANCE AND THIS BILL WOULD OPEN UP AN UNNECESSARY NEW REGULATORY PROCESS- SO WE ASK YOU TO HOLD THE BILL IN COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MCGOVERN AND AGAIN WOULD JUST REMIND FOLKS AND- WE DIDN'T GET ANY FORMAL LEAD OPPOSITION BUT JUST REMIND EVERYONE ON THE LINE THAT WE JUST NEED YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION IN YOUR FARM OPPOSITION TO SB.

I CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE STEVEN JIMENEZ WITH AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU NEXT COMMENT PLEASE. NO FOR THE LINES IN Q. OKAY THANK YOU SO WE'VE EXHAUSTED OUR SUPPORT IN AN OPPOSITION WITNESSES- WILL BRING IT BACK TO MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. OKAY WE SEE NONE IS THERE A MOTION. IN SUPPORT OF SB. TWO TWO SEVEN. MOTION TO MOVE IT OKAY SENATOR ARCHULETA MOVES- AND I WOULD JUST SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR- JONES FOR COMING TO ME AND SPEAKINGWITH ME DIRECTLY I APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW THE DISCUSSION OF COURSE I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT I WILL BE OPPOSING THE BILL TODAY JUST. GIVEN THE- THE STANCE THAT I HAVE ON YOU KNOW GHG EMISSIONS AND IN ASKING OUR SMALL FLEET TRUCK DRIVERS AND YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO DO SOME WORK HERE THOUGH AND I AND I RESPECT YOUR YOUR- KEY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DISCUSSING THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING ISSUE WE NEED TO ABSOLUTELY DO SOMETHING AS IT PERTAINS TO RECREATION AND ENVIRONMENT AND WOULD LOVE TO BE PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS BUT NONE THE LESS I KNOW EVERY MEMBER HAS A DIFFERENT STANCE ON THIS SO. WE'LL WE'LL SEE WHERE THIS TAKES ABOUT I JUST APPRECIATE YOUR DISCUSSIONS WITH ME ABOUT THIS BILL. AND SENATOR SKINNER HAS A QUESTION AS WELL. THANK YOU CARE I JUST WANT TO MAKE THE COMMENT THAT. GIVEN THAT WE STILL HAVE. MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT EXCEEDS HEALTHY AIR QUALITY AND ARE THEM HAVE THE MOST POLLUTED AIR. WHICH OF COURSE WE KNOW HAS GREAT IMPACTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH- IT IN BASICALLY THE- THE MOST POLLUTED AIR OF ANY STATE IN YOU SWEAT A LITTLE LOUDER MISS SENATORS CANNOT YET IS MY NOW MY MARKS ON A GUESS IT WASN'T ON BEFORE- THE POINT I WAS MAKING IS THAT I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. BECAUSE WE PUT REQUIREMENTS ON EVERY SECTOR OF INDUSTRY. AROUND AIR QUALITY AND EMISSIONS FROM THE VEHICLES AND- WE AND WE DO SO BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF THAT POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA STILL REMAINS THE STATE WITH. COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE WORST AIR QUALITY AND THUS THE MOST PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS OF POLLUTION FROM VEHICLE EMISSIONS. SO TO OVERRIDE OUR AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS ON JUST THIS SECTOR WHEN WE KNOW THAT WE ARE STILL HOLDING OTHER VEHICLES TO OUR STANDARDS I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY A FAIR PROCESS SO I APPRECIATE THAT THERE WERE- OBVIOUSLY CAN BE STILL. CAN DISCUSSION AND DIALOGUE TO HOW TO ADDRESS THIS BUT I THINK- IT'S UNFAIR TO GIVE AN EXCEPTION TO THIS CATEGORY WHEN WE HAVEN'T DONE SO WITH SO MANY OTHER VEHICLES. THANK YOU.

HE HAD- I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY- WITH WHAT THE AUTHOR IS SAID IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER- DROPPING SO PRECIPITOUSLY IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS OF USES IT AND THE FACT THAT THESE ARE MOSTLY IN REAL RURAL AREAS NOT REALLY YOUR NEGATIVE AIR QUALITY AREAS. I JUST I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT AT THE AT LEAST AT THIS POINT TIME YEAH THAT'S THE MINIMUS AND I REALLY THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND- YOU'LL FOLLOW THE PROGRESS AND- WE CAN ALWAYS- WE CAN ALWAYS BENEFIT IF YOU KNOW IF WE NEED TO BUT I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- IS A RIGHTEOUS BILL I SUPPORTED THE LAST YEAR ALL SUPPORTED AGAIN.

RIGHT AWAY TRANSFER IN GREAT REDWOOD TRAIL ACT. WE'RE GOING TO TEST YOU HAD TO MAKE SURE YOU GOT THAT TIME. JUST OR YOU VERY QUICKLY THIS IS A FOLLOW UP BILL TO OUR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN LEGISLATION WHICH WAS SB TEN TWENTY NINE THAT WAS THE INSECURITY CLOSURE IN TRANSITION TO TRAIL ACT WHICH WAS SIGNED BY THEN GOVERNOR BROWN. SINCE THE LAST TIME THAT WE ALL TALKED AND WE'RE IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT WITH THE GREAT RIVER TRAIL WITH THE TWO YEAR STATE AUDIT THAT HAS JUST BEEN COMPLETED. THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT AGENCY DEBT PAID ASSETS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED IN THE FORMAL WINE DOWN THE FORMAL WIND DOWN OF THE BANKRUPT HOT MESS OF A PUBLIC AGENCY NORTH COAST RAILROAD AUTHORITY IS NOW UNDER WAY. LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY ON THIS BILL SB TEN TWENTY NINE SET UP A PROCESS TO TRANSITION THE THREE HUNDRED PLUS MILE MOSTLY DILAPIDATED IN LARGER LARGELY INOPERATIVE RAIL LINES INTO A WORLD CLASS TRAIL SYSTEM THAT RUN THROUGH SOME OF THE WILDEST AND MOST SCENIC LANDSCAPES IN AMERICA. WITH THE HIGH COST OF MAINTAINING THE TRACKS IN THE SHORTAGE OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND GOODS TO TRANSPORT PRIVATELY OWNED FREIGHT RAIL SERVICE ON THE NORTH COAST DIED A SLOW DEATH. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THIS LEGISLATURE CREATED THE IN CRA MORISCO THREE ONE TO THIRTY IN A LAST DITCH EFFORT THE SAFE FREIGHT RAIL TRAFFIC ON THE NORTH COAST UNFORTUNATELY THIS DIDN'T WORK. BUT WHEN THE GOVERNOR AT THE TIME VETO THE FUNDING MECHANISM FOR THE AUTHORITY IT NEVER HAD A CHANCE CANDIDLY AND IT'S NOW MIRED IN MASSIVE DEBT IN THE STATE IS OFFICIALLY WINDING IT DOWN WHICH IS A REALLY GOOD THING. WHEN HUGE LANDSLIDES COVERED LARGE SWATHS OF THE TRACK IN THE OVER CANYON DURING THE REIGNS OF NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE LINE WAS THE ORDERED CLOSED BY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NO ONE I KNOW WHEN. HAS FOR EVER. TO REACH FREIGHT. SMART A PUBLIC RAIL AGENCY CREATED BY VOTERS IN THE SOUTHERN REGION THE LINE IN CINEMA IN MARIN COUNTY'S IS REBUILDING OR HAS REBUILT AT THE RAIL LINE BETWEEN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AND THE NORTHERN CINEMA COUNTY LINE BUT EVERYTHING TO THE NORTH REMAINS CLOSED AND IMPASSABLE TO A FREIGHT TRAIN. THIS YEAR WE HAVE INTRODUCED SB SIXTY NINE TO FINISH THE JOB OF CLOSING DOWN IN SIERRA EIGHT ONCE AND FOR ALL IN OFFICIALLY TRANSFERRING THEIR ASSETS IN THE SOUTH AND- TOO SMART. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THEIR PORTION THE GREAT RIVER TRAIL. THE VOTERS MANDATE. THE BILL TRANSITION IS THE INSPIRATION REDWOOD TRAIL AGENCY WHO WILL ASSUME ALL ASSETS OF NTRA ON THE NORTHERN SECTION OF THE RIGHT AWAY. ESSENTIALLY THE RAIL BED IT WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THEIR PORTION OF THE TRAIL THROUGH MENDOCINO AND HUMBOLDT COUNTIES. THE TRAVEL SOON BECOME THE LONGEST CONTINUOUS RAIL TRAIL IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IT WILL BE A BOON TO RULE COMMUNITIES WHO HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN BUILT ALONG THE LINE. THE ONLY FOLKS THAT WE KNOW OF A WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL ARE FOLKS WHO HAVE UNSUCCESSFULLY LOBBIED FOR FREIGHT RAIL. ON THE NORTH COAST FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. AN INTERESTING FACT ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION THE GREAT RIVER TRAIL. WE'LL RAIL BANK MOST OF THE LINE SO WHAT THE HECK ISRAEL BANKING. IT'S ESSENTIALLY GUARANTEEING THAT THE RAIL THAT WILL STAY IN PLACE. AND ALLOW FOR FUTURE RAIL IF AND WHEN IT IS EVER POSSIBLE IN THAT IMAGINARY INVESTOR STEPS UP. YOU SIMPLY PUT DIRT OR GRAVEL OVER THE RAIL TURNING INTO A TRAIL. AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT REAL MAKING WAS DESIGNED FOR A WIN UNITED STATES CONGRESS PASSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. SINCE THEN ACROSS THE U. S. OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES OF RAIL CORRIDORS. WANTS ACTIVE AROUND THE US ARE PROTECTED FOR FUTURE REAL USE AND ARE NOW BEING ENJOYED BY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. WHO ARE USING TRAILS THAT HAVE NOW BEEN PUT ON TOP OF RAILS AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. THE GREAT BRITAIN TRAIL. WITHOUT RAIL LINKING THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE OF THIS RIGHT AWAY WILL BE OFFICIALLY ABANDONED IN SPLIT UP FOREVER WE NEED TO PROTECT THAT RAIL BED. IN BE ABLE TO USE IT AS A WORLD CLASS TRAIL ASSET. THIS LANGUAGE IT'S A WIN WIN FORTHE STATE IN THE NORTH COAST COMMUNITIES FOR A CONHECER DEPENDING AND OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL KANEMI.

AND CREATE THE LONGEST RAIL TRAIL IN THE COUNTRY AND I CAN SAY AS SOMEONE WHO HAS WORKED IN THE PARKS FIELD FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS THAT MUCH OF THE TRAIL WILL BE CREATED INEXPENSIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY BY GRADING THE EXISTING RIGHT OF WAY. AND ADDING A WALKABLE RIDEABLE TRAIL SERVICE. SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HEAR TO MUCH OF THE PACIFIC CREST OR APPALACHIAN TRAIL. IT IS USUALLY SUPPORTED BY THE CITIES AND TOWNS FROM SANTA ROSA TO WILLITS TO EUREKA THROUGH WHICH IT WILL RUN. PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESSES TO TIE IN AND SERVE. HIKERS AND RIDERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY FROM SAN FRANCISCO BAY. TO HUMBOLDT BAY THROUGH THE EEL RIVER CANYON AND THE GREAT REDWOOD FORESTS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

THERE ARE TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED RAIL TRAILS AND- TOTALING NEARLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES OF RAIL TRAILS. AND THEN SENATE REQUIRE MENTIONED PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GREAT RED WOULD TRAIL THE NTRA IS RAIL BANKING THE NOR HERE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE CORRIDOR. AND THE REAL BANKING STATUTES- INACTIVE BY CONGRESS IS BASICALLY ALLOWS A REAL ROAD TO BANK A CORRIDOR FOR FUTURE POTENTIAL REAL USED EACH NEEDED. AND IN THE INTERIM PUT IT TO USE AS A TRAIL. ONE REAL BANKING HAS- EFFECTIVELY PRESERVES THOUSANDS OF MILES OF RAIL CORRIDORS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN ABANDONED AND CHOPPED INTO MANY PIECES WHICH IS WHY WE OFTEN CALL IT THE HUMPTY DUMPTY PRESERVATION ACT. PRESERVES A VALUABLE ASSET. AND IT JUST A BRIEF CALM ON THE CALL. ESTIMATES THE RECENT ASSESSMENT REPORT. CAME IN WITH SOME HIGH ESTIMATES THAT IT APPEARS TO ASSUME THE WORST CASE SCENARIO OTHER BEING CONSERVATIVE BUT THE FACT IS THERE IS NO PROJECT DESIGNED TO EVALUATE NOR WAS THERE SUFFICIENT DETAILED INFORMATION ON EXISTING CONDITIONS. AND YOU KNOW FOR UNPAVED TRAILS WHICH ILLEGAL YOU'VE LIKELY OPTION FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE CORRIDOR FIVE WE TYPICALLY SEE COST CLOSER TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES.

BRING MADAM CHAIR SHERMAN YOU OUR COLLECTION GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR OUR ORGANIZATION IS SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE ON TRAINS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE GHG EMISSIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS PEOPLE NEED LOW CARBON WAYS TO TRAVEL WE OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD THROW AWAY A MAJOR STATE INVESTMENT IN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND TURNED IT INTO A MERE RECREATION. CALIFORNIA IS SPENDING BILLIONS ON RAIL INVESTMENTS ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE GIVEN THAT CONTEXT HOW ON EARTH DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO RIP OUT THE RAILS IN THE NORTH COAST DEFENDER CLAIMS IT WOULD SAVE MONEY IN BUILDING HIS TRAIL IF YOU THEN HAD TO RE LOCATE THE TRAIL IN ORDER TO USE THE RAILS IN THE FUTURE THE STATE WOULD PAY TO REBUILD THE TRAIL WHAT THE MUCH HIGHER AMOUNT THE LADY NEW RAIL. THAT'S NOT A WAY TO SAVE MONEY. THE BILL PROPOSES RAIL BANKING AS A WAY TO PRESERVE THE LEGAL RIGHT OF WAY WHEN TEARING UP THE TRACKS UNFORTUNATELY IT'S FAR MORE COMPLICATED LEGALLY THEN THE BILL SUGGESTS. THE SENATORS BILL ENDANGERS THE INTEGRITY OF THE THREE HUNDRED PLUS. BOB MILE RIGHT OF WAY. HIGHWAY ONE OH ONE IN MENDOCINO COUNTY HAS A LOT OF TRUCKS MANY SHIPPERS THERE WANNA SEND THEIR PRODUCTS BY RAIL SB SIXTY NINE WOULD PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING.

PARTS ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN CONVENTIONAL DIESEL TRUCKS FOR EXAMPLE THE PURCHASER OF AN ELECTRIC CLASS EIGHT TRUCK COULD.

WE CAN MOVE OUR GOODS WITHOUT INFLICTING DIESEL EXHAUST ON OUR COMMUNITIES THERE ARE MANY ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS THAT ARE IN THE DEMONSTRATION PILOT OR EVEN COMMERCIAL STAGES ALREADY AND THEY WILL REALIZE DOLLAR SAVINGS IN FUEL AND MAINTENANCE COSTS. BUT THE STICKER PRICES OF THESE QUEEN TRUCKS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THEY ARE FOR DIESEL TRUCKS AND THAT MEANS THE TAXES ARE HIGHER AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY. DIESEL TRUCKS HAVE A LOWER PRICE UP FRONT BUT MUCH HIGHER COSTS WHEN IT COMES TO FUEL USE AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY IN TERMS OF THE COST THAT THEY INFLICT ON OUR COMMUNITIES. IN THE FORM OF TOXIC AIR POLLUTION AND WE KNOW THAT THAT BURDEN FALLS DISPROPORTIONATELY ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SO THIS BILL IS A SMART INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE WHICH WILL BRING FOR YEARS REDUCE COSTS DUE TO ASTHMA PREMATURE DEATH.

CLEAN AIR GOALS- THE THEY'RE VERY AMBITIOUS- BUT WE ARE ON TRACK TO MEETING THEM GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN'S EXECUTIVE ORDER RETAINING FIVE MILLION SAM'S ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY THIRTY. NINE GOVERNOR NEWSOM SUPPORTER TO COMPLETELY PHASE OUT GAS POWERED AUTOMOBILES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. ARE THESE TARGETS MAY SEEM AGGRESSIVE BUT THEY ARE NECESSARY WE HAVE HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN ABOUT THE PERILS OF. CLIMATE CHANGE WE'RE SEEING THIS IN CALIFORNIA IN REAL TIME. MY DISTRICT LIKE MANY OF YOURS IS UNDER SIEGE FROM THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE- WE HAVE OUR COASTLINE THAT IS- THREATENED BY RISING SEA LEVELS. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE- LARGE PARTS ARE DISTRICT THAT ARE ON THE VERGE OF- A EACH ON THE PERIPHERY OF WILDFIRES INCLUDING MY HOMETOWN IRVINE WHICH- CAME VERY VERY CLOSE TO BEING. HAVING PARTS OF IT BURNED DOWN THIS PAST- WINTER OUR CARS AND TRUCKS ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE FIFTH OF ALL U. S. EMISSIONS AND OUR MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR CALIFORNIA'S- GREENHOUSE GASES- TRANSPORTATION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HALF OF ALL OF OUR STATES CARBON POLLUTION. AND SO I'M GRATEFUL TO SEE ALL OF THE EXCITING AND DECISIVE EFFORTS TO TRY TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT THE RISE OF THE TIME MISS VEHICLES PULL. A C. RISK CITIES OF GOALS- I THINK I WE SEE. WITH THE RISE OF WISHES. OF RIDE SHARING. AS WELL AS SOME OF THE INITIAL ESTIMATES ADONIS VEHICLES ARE ESTIMATED TO ADD AS MUCH AS SIX TIMES- THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED PER VEHICLE- AND SO IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT AT THE OUTSET THAT WE SET STANDARDS- THAT REQUIRE THAT. A THOMAS VEHICLES B. HE SAYS- AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS TOO FAR OF A STRETCH AS WE KNOW. THERE ARE PLENTY OF XAMPP OPTIONS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW- AND THEY'LL BE PLENTY MORE AVAILABLE BY THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN- A TIMELESS VEHICLES- CAN OF COURSE THIS SOFTWARE FOR THESE CAN BE. FITTED TO VARIOUS TYPES OF HARDWARE VERY FEW OF THE TIME TO BE CALLED SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. ARE DEVELOPING THEIR OWN CARS- SO- WE KNOW THAT. WHEN THERE'S ELECTRIC VEHICLES HYDROGEN THERE'S PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE. THEIR VEHICLES IN I THINK THIS IS JUST. A VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT AGAIN WE GET THIS RIGHT AT THE VERY BEGINNING THIS IS NOT SCIENCE FICTION IT'S SOMETHING WHERE WE HAVE TO TECHNOLOGIES. THAT WILL BE HERE THAT ARE ALREADY HERE. AND THAT WILL BE WIDESPREAD SOONER THAN WE THINK INSIDE I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE PASS THIS BILL AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT URGE YOU. TO VOTE HI- WITH ME TODAY I HAVE TWO WITNESSES ELIZABETH URBAN. A SENIOR TRANSPORTATION OUT OF ANALYST IN A CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. AT UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS. AND PER SHANTI REMIND DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND CRUISE- A SELF DRIVING CAR SERVICE- TRANSFORMING TRANSPORTATION. THANK YOU CENTER MEN'S WE'LL START WITH A MISTER. DIMITRI FROM. TECHCONNECT MISTER MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE BRING KEVIN ON THE LINE. MR DIMITRI YOUR LINE IS OPEN TO CLARA- BETTER SHARE I'M ACTUALLY IN OPPOSITION WOULD YOU LIKE ME THAT WAY. MY APOLOGIES YES- WE WILL START WITH. MS ELIZABETH ERVIN FROM UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS. RIVERVIEW LINE IS OPEN GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CAROLINE GONZALEZ AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS A LITTLE BIT URBAN I'M  SENIOR TRANSPORTATION ANALYST THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS UCS IS THE NATION'S LEADING SCIENCE BASED NONPROFIT PUTTING RIGOROUS INDEPENDENT SCIENCE TO WORK TO SOLVE OUR PLANET'S MOST PRESSING PROBLEM. ON BEHALF OF UPS'S MORE THAN FORTY FOUR THOUSAND SUPPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA I AM PLEASED TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE HUNDRED- AND- WE SHOULD REQUIRE AUTOMATED VEHICLES TO BE DEPLOYED AS EUROVISION VEHICLES. THERE IS EXPERT CONSENSUS THAT ELECTRIFYING ATVS IT'S ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS TO ENSURING THEY ARE SUSTAINABLE PART OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. FOR EXAMPLE RESEARCH FROM UC DAVIS FOUND THAT PERSONALLY OWNED EIGHTIES ARE LIKELY TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED WITH A LARGE PORTION OF THOSE MILES COMING WITH NO PASSENGERS IN THE VEHICLE. THEY ALSO FOUND EIGHT EITHER LIKELY TO SHIFT PEOPLE AWAY FROM LOWER EMISSION KNOWS. YES YES RESEARCH SHOWS THE POTENTIAL FOR EIGHTY TO INCREASE- BOTH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION. EVEN IN A SCENARIO WHERE POLICIES ENCOURAGE PULLING IN TRANSIT. OUR RESEARCH ALSO FOUND THAT NEGATIVE IMPACTS CONGESTION AIR POLLUTION WERE LIKELY TO HAPPEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IN COMMUNITIES ALREADY EXPERIENCING ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICES. WE CAN ALSO LEARN FROM THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF RIDE HAILING WHICH UCS AND HARPER HAVE BOTH SOUNDS TO INCREASE EMISSIONS COMPARED TO PERSONAL CARS. ACCORDING TO UCS ANALYSIS THE AVERAGE RIDE HAILING TRIPS IS 69% MORE POLLUTING THAN THE TRAINS THEY REPLACE. REPORTS AND OTHERS HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO DEPLOY EIGHTIES AT THAT IN ORDER TO MITIGATE EMISSIONS IMPACT. PART OF A BROADER STRATEGY TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION. THE OVERALL OF CALIFORNIA POLICY IT'S CLEAR WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS A ZERO EMISSION TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES LIKE AUTOMATED VEHICLES SHOULD BE LEADING THE WAY. THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT ACTIONS INCLUDING THE ONES THAT- CENTER MAN NAMED IN HIS OPENING REMARKS I WOULD JUST ADD ALSO. ACCOUNTS THIS DRAFT FRAMEWORK WHICH LISTS THE PLAN IF YOU'RE MISSING A BEAT AS PART OF ITS FIRST GUIDING PRINCIPLE- AND THE GREEN MILE STANDARD UNDER CONSIDERATION BY CARD THAT WOULD REQUIRE RIDE. HAILING PEOPLE TO TRANSITION TO THAT. COMPANIES ARE ALREADY DEPLOYING ELECTRIC EIGHTIES. ACCORDING TO THE STATE. REPORTS ABOUT 50% OF THE TESTING MILD IN TWENTY TWENTY WERE ELECTRIC. THE TECHNOLOGY IS FEASIBLE NECESSARY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE GOAL. GIVEN THE FACTORS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. DEPLOYING EIGHTIES POWER BATTLEFIELD IN CALIFORNIA IT WOULD BE LIKE DEPLOYING A SMARTPHONE WITH A ROTARY DIAL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF SB FIVE HUNDRED. THANK YOU MS IRVINE WE APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE NEXT TO LEAD SUPPORT WITNESS PER SHANTI REMOND FROM CRUISE. A PER SHANTI CAN YOU PLEASE GO RIGHT AHEAD WITH A SUPPORT. FOR SB. FIVE HUNDRED. GOOD MORNING I HEARD IN BALLOTS AND RESPECTED COMMITTED MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY HI MY NAME IS SHANTI RAMAN AND I AM CONVINCED DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL GOTTEN. CARE AND YES THEY EXPRESSED OUR SUPPORT OF. THE FIVE HUNDRED. ALL ELECTRIC SELF DRIVING TECHNOLOGY COMPANY WITH THE MISSION TO BUILD THE WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED ON THE VEHICLE. BASICALLY CONNECT PEOPLE TO PLACES THINGS AND. EXPERIENCES THEY CARE ABOUT. UNDER THE PREMISE TRANSPORTATION THE EXACT TODAY FUNDS AND FLAWED AND CAR POLLUTION IS ONE OF THE NAMES WHY. TODAY TRêN- FOR A 40% GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. AS YEAR WE WENT THE NET IMPACTS OF CLIMATE DAM THIS AND HOME. EACH FIRED BECAUSE MORE THAN LAST. ECONOMIC HIGH COULD BE HAD THEIR BACK HEALTH AND IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE CARBONITE TRANSPORTATION. SIGNIFICANTLY MEDICATIONS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE. I COULD BELIEVE AND SHALL THE QUO. SEVEN FIVE OUR VEHICLE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING. DAY ONE AND IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN POWER BY 1100% RENEWABLE ENERGY. BY IN OUR HOME STATE. TWENTY IN TWENTY ARE A JOB SEVEN HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND FOURTEEN CREATE HUNDRED MILE HELLO. I NEED SHOWS THAT NOT ONLY GOING ELECTRIC THE BOOK TODAY BUT ALL OF OUR THING YOU BRING IN. AT THE START OF A PANDEMIC WE WITH TV AND FORTH AND BAKER. ON THE VEHICLE PROVIDE CURRENT WITH LIVERY THE FAMILY THE OPPOSITE. TO DATE ARE PROUD TO SAY THE COMPLETED. THOUSAND OF DELIVER. ABOUT 80% WHICH ABOUT HOW BELOW THE TEMPERATURE COPY LINE. BEING YOU ARE WOULD LIKELY DONE IN GAP CARD CARD AND IT IS JUST SERVING THOSE IN OUR- ON THE ROAD A QUICK. THE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND TOTAL POUND THE END YOU EMISSIONS AVOIDED THANK MISTER. CALIFORNIA. IF YOU CAN- WRAP UP YOUR TEST OF IN THE WILL GO ON TO OUR SUPPORTERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COOLEY- BUT I THINK HUNDRED POWER HAS BEEN OUT TO TAKE ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS MEETING AMBITIOUS I'M- AND A TENDER WE BUILD IT YOU KNOW WHAT THE- TRANSPORTATION. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HEARD AND- SHE'D ABOUT. THE FIVE HUNDRED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS MIRAMONTE AND MS IRVINE SO WITH THAT WE'VE CONCLUDED LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE HUNDRED SO WE'LL GO TO THE GALLERY IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBERS.

WE SHOULD BECAUSE WE ARE TO REDUCE GAS AND IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THE BILL AND CRAFT. THE REPRESENTATIVE ADDED THOMAS COMPANIES WITHIN MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT MODELS FROM SWEET TO INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP. AND VARYING LEVELS OF TECHNOLOGY. WHAT WEBER INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES MAY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO COMPLY WITH SOME OF THE PARAMETERS. AND INITIALIZATION WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IT'S PREMATURE. ALRIGHT COVERAGE EFFECTIVE ORDER THE QUESTIONS THAT FOR COMPLYING TO HOLD DECADES IDEA VEHICLE. INTO DEBT AHEAD ON THE HEAVY DUTY SIDE. ADVOCATE FOR TEN. APPROACH THAT WILL LEAD TO THE EVENT X. INTO. BUT BOTTOM MADE IT CALLS WHICH TO DATE ARE VERY MUCH IN THE STATE CAL. IN DOING SO WE BELIEVE THAT BILL THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY MABEL AND SOLUTIONS WHICH ARE COMING RECALLS COULD UNLOCK FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. AB TEST COOPER AT THE TO SAVE LIVES THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ABILITY AND INCREASED RATE HE- WE'RE CONCERNED THE BILL WOULD DELAY THE ROLLOUT OKAY FEES AND STATE BY DOING SO SURE THEY DENY CALIFORNIANS WHO SUBSTANTIAL SAFETY MOBILITY ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OFFERED BY EIGHTY. THE TEXT MESSAGE. THESE ARE VERY HELPFUL- EIGHTIES HELPING TO LEAD THE WAY ON REDUCING EMISSIONS. ALREADY USING ELECTRIC. EIGHT I DO NOT HEAR THAT YOU'RE AT YOUR MINUTES IF YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND WRAP UP WILL GO HEAD AND COMPLETE YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WE UNDERSTAND THEIR AMENDMENTS FORTHCOMING TO CONSIDER AND WILL DO SO ACCORDINGLY BUT OVERALL WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE STATUS. ARBITRARY DEADLINES THAT COULD DELAY THE LIVE CD INTEGRATED. SOLUTIONS IN THE STATION SPACE WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITIES PRESS OUR CONCERNS AND OPPOSITION SB FIVE HUNDRED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR TO ME TRULY APPRECIATE THAT- HAVING HEARD FROM PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- TO SB FIVE HUNDRED WILL NOW GO TO. GALLERY WE SEE KNOWN. ANYONE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE IN OPPOSITION. OF SB FIVE HUNDRED. WE SEE NONE MODERATOR FROM. THE WITNESS AND. OKAY MISTER AERIAL WOLF. APOLOGIES SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GO TO MISTER WOLF WITH THE SELF DRIVING COALITION ANOTHER LEAD OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME YES GO RIGHT AHEAD MY APOLOGIES THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU SO MUCH READING CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ARGHA WALT AND I SERVICE GENERALCOUNSEL TO THE SELF DRIVING COALITION FOR SAFER STREETS THANKYOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON SB FIVE HUNDRED REGRETFULLY WE MUST OPPOSE THE BILL. THE SLF DRIVING COALITION IS COMPRISED OF FIFTEEN OF THE WORLD'S LEADING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPERS INCLUDING COMPANIES ACROSS THE TECHNOLOGY RIDE SHARING TRUCKING AND AUTOMOTIVE SECTORS OUR MISSION IS TO BRING THE BENEFITS OF FULLY SELF DRIVING DRIVING VEHICLE TO CONSIDER CONSUMERS AND TO SUPPORT THE STATEMENTS WITH THE PLUMBING OF THE TECHNOLOGY WE SUPPORT THE AMBITIOUS GOAL OF SB FIVE HUNDRED AND WELCOME THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN AGREED TO BUT WE REMAIN CONCERNED THAT THE BILL WOULD DELAY THE ROLLOUT OF BABIES IN THE STATEAND BY DOING SO WOULD DENY CALIFORNIA SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS OFFERED BY AB TECHNOLOGY WHICH COULD INCLUDE PREVENTING THOUSANDS OF ROADWAY FATALITIES. WE WELCOME THE AMENDMENTS THAT MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES REMOVED FROM APPLICABILITY AND LIMIT APPLICABLE TO ORIGINAL REGISTRATION HOWEVER WE REMAIN CONCERNED THAT THE BILL APPLIES LED YOU TO BE A COLD EVEN WITH AN IMPLEMENTATION THAT DELAYED THE TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN WOULD HINDER THE DEPLOYMENT OF AB TECHNOLOGY FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED FIRST. THE COMPLIANCE DEADLINE WOULD REQUIRE AB TO BE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE NEARLY TEN YEARS BEFORE THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER REDUCE OUT THIS WOULD SEVERELY RESTRICT AN. INDUSTRY THAT IS LARGELY IN THE TESTING STAGE. SECOND FOR REASOS ARE UNCLEAR BILL WOULD LEAVE OTHER MODES TRANSFER. SUBJECT THE LONGER TIMELINE THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IN PURSUIT IMPORTANT SUSTAINABILITY OBJECTIVES EXCLUSIVELY FOR REGULATION AB TRANSPORTATION A NON TECHNOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL APPROACH DOES NOT ACCORD WITH THE STATE'S FULL TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS PICTURE. THERE ARE MANY OF THE CURRENT AB FLEET YOU THE MIXTURE OF BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND GASOLINE ELECTRIC HYBRIDS FOR VARIOUS TECHNOLOGICAL REASONS INCLUDING RELATED COMPUTING POWER FULL ELECTRIFICATION OF. OF ALL LIGHT DUTY AB GERMAIN'S PREMATURE PROMOTE THE DEVELOPERS. FINALLY AT THIS COMMITTEE ON THE ON THE AND THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE RECOGNIZED THE JOINT HEARING LAST WEEK ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES MUST BE PAIRED WITH INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS TO ENABLE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION. WE KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATORS COMMITMENTS THE FINDINGS HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE ARE UNLIKELY TO BE FOUR BUILDING ADVANCED COMPLIANCE DATE. IN THIS BILL. WELL THE GOAL IS REMAIN OPPOSED TO SB FIVE HUNDRED WE APPRECIATE THE REVISIONS AGREED TO BY THE SPONSORING THE COMMITTEE AND WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE WORKING ALONGSIDE THE COMMITTEE.

OUR FINAL LEARNING QUEUES LINE EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. TIM BLUE BAR ON BEHALF OF THE TRUCK AND ENGINE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION I APOLOGIZE WE HAVE REGISTERED A NEUTRAL POSITION WE THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR ANALYSIS THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT WILL ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. AND WITH THAT TURNOVER MIND IN Q. OKAY THANK YOU MR MODERATOR SO WE'LL TAKE IT BACK TO CHAMBERS HERE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. MISS OKAY GREAT SENATOR NEWMAN. I THANK ABOUT CHURCH OKAY QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR- I DO APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE BILL. AND AS YOU HEARD BEFORE I AM A HUGE BELIEVER IN THE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE THE ADOPTION OF. ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES. BUT I DO TAKE SERIOUSLY THE POINT MADE BY A COUPLE OF THE WITNESSES ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T IN ON INTENTIONALLY RESTRICT THE DEVELOPMENT CAPACITY OF THIS INDUSTRY. BYE BYE MAKING- IS TO OVERLY SPECIFIC SPECIFICATIONS THAT MIGHT REALLY IN IN P. THEIR ABILITY TO DO THE KINDS OF RESEARCH AND TESTING MINUTES THAT ARE NECESSARY. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AT THE PRESS CANCE ABSOLUTELY I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER I'D APPRECIATE IT- SO WEIRD WITH I JUST WANNA EMPHASIZE WE. AND THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS- WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THOSE SAME CONCERNS THE GOAL HERE IS NOT IN P. THE ROLLOUT OF USEFUL TECHNOLOGY- BUT RATHER TO SHARE THIS WITH A ANOTHER EMERGING TECHNOLOGY- WE ARE TO CROSSROADS RIGHT NOW WHERE. THE DEPLOYMENT OF AV'S IS GOING TO LEAD EVENTUALLY TO A LOT MORE MILES DRIVEN THAT'S THE PREDICTION EVERYONE AND- IS TO THE GOAL HERE IS A SORT OF SEPARATE FROM THAT BUT AS TO THE PARTICULAR IS CONCERNED- WE HAVE CARVED OUT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEPLOYMENT AND TESTING SO ALL THESE COMPANIES ARE ALLOWED TO TEST ON WHATEVER TYPE OF VEHICLES THEY WANT FOSSIL FUEL HYBRID. BY ANYTHING THEY WANT- WE'RE JUST SIMPLY REQUIRING THE DEPLOYMENT BE LIMITED TO SAYS- IT THIS POINT WHILE THERE ARE GENERALIZED CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT- INCLUDING SOME OF THE COMMENTS TODAY ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT HINDER. DEPLOYMENT WE'VE NOT ACTUALLY HEARD ANY SPECIFIED EXAMPLES- AND THAT'S YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING AS HIS DATE OF A I GUESS MY- HALFWAY INFORMED BELIEVE THAT I'D LIKE TO SORT OF LEARN MORE ABOUT- EAST IS THAT THERE'S NO REASON WE CAN'T DEPLOY. WITHOUT IMPEDING ANY KIND LINES- THAT RIGHT NOW HOLD UP ON THE DEPLOYMENT OF AV'S ACROSS THE STATE IS NOT BECAUSE OF THE HARDWARE THAT IS TO SAY IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF THEM. IT'S RATHER BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE SOFTWARE- IN SO AT THIS POINT THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE COMPANY CREWS THAT'S BEEN APPROVED THE DEPLOYMENT CITY CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S NOT WHICH IN EFFECT AT THIS BILL HAS NOT YET PASSED SO- THE DELAYS IN GETTING BABIES ROLE THAT REALLY AYE I THINK OR NOT. TIED TO ANY KIND IS HAVE. AND I ARGUE THESE HAVE ARE MUCH FURTHER ALONG AS FAR AS BEING A NASCENT TECHNOLOGY THAT'S REALLY HITTING THE MARKET AND AV'S- SO AGAIN WHAT OPEN THE CRITICISMS- BUT BUT YOU KNOW WANT TO SEE MORE DATA. HI IT WAS ONE OF THE REASON WE DIDN'T GET BACK TO TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN IS JUST YOU KNOW WE WANTED TO TAKE SERIOUSLY THE CONCERNS THAT WE MIGHT BE IMPEDING. THE DEPLOYMENT OF AV'S. PRETTY SURE THAT IS OWED TO THE CHAIR. IS THE LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESSED MR WILL STILL AVAILABLE RESPOND I THINK HE'S- EQUIPPED. TO RESPOND DIRECTLY TO A- YEAH AND IF I MAY. SENATOR NEWMAN I DON'T FOR WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR IS WELL THAT WE KEEP. SENATOR MEN AND I WORKED VERY HARD IN THIS OVER THE WE SEE. AT LENGTH- WITH MY COMMITTEE AND MYSELF HE IS TAKING AND I JUST WANT TO- CLEAR UP THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU WILL BE TAKING. THE EFFECTIVE DATE WILL BE PUSHED BACK BY TWO YEARS FROM THE ORIGINAL BILL LANGUAGE TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN- DOES NOT APPLY TO MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO DO IN THAT SPACE- CERTAINLY KNOW THAT AND THEN ONLY PLACE A LIGHT DUTY CLASS ONE AND CLASS TWO VEHICLES. N. ONLY APPLIES TO NEW REGISTRATIONS- SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT CLEARS ANYTHING ELSE UP FOR YOU BUT IF. YOU AND I THINK IT DOES KIND OF WITHIN THE CHAMBER BUT I WANT TO ASSURE THAT. THE OPPOSITION IS WELL APPRISED OF THESE AMENDMENTS AND NOT CLEAR TO ME AT THE MOMENT F THEY ARE- DAVE RESPONDED TO THEM DIRECTLY AT THIS POINT. CERTAINLY MR MODERATOR TO HAVE MISTER WOLF ON THE LINE. I DO MISTER WALKER LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THE FOR THE QUESTION TO BE A HAPPY TO RESPOND- THE AT THE OTHER I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE FUND. PREMISE OF AB TECHNOLOGY IS TO- IS TO SAVE LIVES TO PROVIDE SAFETY TECHNOLOGY. PLAN SO WEIGHED AGAINST ALL THIS IS THE BILL TO DO THAT AND OUR- ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS- ENORMOUS SEGMENT OF THE AV FULLY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE. TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPERS- WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFICS WE ARE ADVISED THAT THE- THE TIMELINE PROPOSED HERE EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS- TO THE QUESTION ASKED ABOUT THAT BEING A PROBLEM BUT WE ARE PRIZED IN THE AMENDMENTS. TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN DEADLINE CONTINUES TO PRESENT- SIGNIFICANT CONCERN AMONG THE DEVELOPERS- AND AS AS A FUNDAMENTAL MATTER AS WELL- THE COALITION VIEWS THE TREATMENT OF ANY VIEWS. AS A SEPARATE MATTER- AS BEING- APPS THE WRONG WITH FIRST TO ALL OTHER MOTOR TREND BEING AFFECTED ON THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TEN YEARS LATER- AND THEN ONE FINAL COMMENT IF I MAY- WITH RESPECT TO YOU AGAIN AND UNDERLYING PREMISE OF THE OF THE OF THE BILL WHICH WE APPRECIATE OF COURSE THE INTENT AND THE OBJECTIVE. IS ON V. M. T. SOME OF THE STUDY THAT WERE CITED WERE ARE SEVERAL YEARS OLD- AND- I PRESUME PRIVATE OWNERSHIP BUT AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IN A STATEMENT IN SUPPORT AND SO- WE WOULD JUST CAUTION THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPACT ON THE EMPTY IT'S NOT CERTAINLY AT THAT MOST IS NOT CLEAR AND IT IT'S PAST MAY ACTUALLY LEAD TO A REDUCTION. AND SO THAT SERVE THE THAN THE IMPETUS LEGISLATION WE JUST CAUTION- THERE MAY BE A GOOD REASON TO WAIT AND HAVE THE BILL ALIGNED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S. EXECUTIVE ORDER THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND SO I AM HAVE ONE LAST THAT'S RIGHT THE QUESTION OTHER TWO IS WHY NOT WHY NOT ALLOW. AT THE END OF. DEADLINE WE THE GOVERNOR SUGGESTED ORDER DEADLINE. IS THAT A QUESTION FOR ME YES THAT'S CORRECT I FOR. THAT I THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS THE A TON OF ARE SUBS OF VARIOUS SUBSET AT THIS POINT OF OVER VEHICLE RIGHT. IF YOU LOOK AT GM FOR AND TOYOTA NEW WITH THEIR BUILDING- THERE ON TO PER. YOU KNOW A HUNDRED. OF THEIR FOR TO BE ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR- I SOME POINT ON THE CALL. IN NEXT TEN TO FIFTEEN. APART THAT RESPONSE CALIFORNIA. PART THAT'S RESPONSE MARKET- BUT AS FAR AS A VIS- YOU KNOW I DON'T SEE I GUESS I FOR FLIP THAT WHAT'S THE ARGUMENT FOR NOT HAVING A VIS. WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT AYE AYE AGAIN THE STUDY THAT HAVE BEEN OUT THERE STRONGLY. THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. IN VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED PASSING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED- AND SO THIS IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY AND I GUESS THE QUESTION IS. IT'S A IT'S IN THE WAY I LOOK AT IS IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE EXISTING CARS THAT ARE BEING MANUFACTURED IN PLACES LIKE DETROIT. AND SOUTH CAROLINA IN JAPAN. WHY NOT REQUIRE THIS TO HAVE THE TO BE SEVENTH OUTSIDE BECAUSE IT'S A BRAND NEW TECHNOLOGY IT'S BEING ROLLED OUT VERY SLOWLY WE'RE BEING CAUTIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW WE'RE DEPLOYING THIS. AND I THINK THIS IS FULLY CONSISTENT WITH THE SAME REASONING. BEHIND OUR OTHER AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS AND SO I GUESS I JUST RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE THAT QUESTION I JUST THINK THAT. YEAH THIS IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY I AS I SAID EARLIER I THINK IT'S A GOOD ARGUMENT TO BE MADE. IT'S ACTUALLY TRAILING BEHIND XSAN SO WHY NOT HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THIS VEHICLES. BE REQUIRED TO ALSO BE IS AS I THINK IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE AS POLICY AND WE CAN MANDATE BY THE WAY THAT ALL CARS. TODAY WHAT IF WE- BOTTOM OF THE WAS A BRAND NEW TO. I THINK WE ARE. GOOD ARE. THAT I. SHOULD ALSO A GRASS. FOR TO BE. POSITIVE SINCE REMOVING THAT DIRECTION OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT OF COURSE. WE HAVE A INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND PUMP GAS. ON WILL BE. WE MANY. LINE AND SO YOU KNOW IT IT'S TO TRAIN. BACK OVER BUT- A VISA TO BRAND NEW. ON MANY TO COME. ARE ARE DOING. I BELIEVE ALL OF THEM ARE LIKE A- IF IN SOME OF ANOTHER. OF THEM ARE. PREPARED EXTREMELY ONE FOR OR ANOTHER T. V. SO I THINK IT'S MY OF A STRETCH- I THINK THE THREE LEADING COMPANIES ALREADY ARE USING SAM'S. FOR THEIR PLATFORM SO- YOU KNOW AGAIN WE WANNA BE MINDFUL OF THAT WE'RE NOT IMPEDING ROLLOUT BUT- WE ALSO I THINK HAVE IMPORTANT CLINICAL SO WE'RE TRYING TO MEET AS WELL. THANK YOU SENATOR MAN SENATOR NEWMAN. HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AND THEN WE KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO SIT THERE ARE QUESTIONS THANK YOU THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN SENATOR BAKER. I WANT TO THANK THE- AUTHORED SOME. AS SAID WITH THE INCREASING MILES. EXPECTED WITH A VIS. THAT WE THEY BE LEFT FOR POLICE SHARED A- AS WE- APPRECIATE THE EFFORT YOU'RE A JUST. TO HAVE ONE QUESTION- THE THIRD IS OUR R. B. THREE. KALRA NOW I GOT SOME COMMENTS ABOUT CHINA LINE WITH. WITH THE TWENTY ARMS SHOWED THAT JUST UNDERSTAND TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN VERSUS TWENTY THIRTY YEAH AND ACTUALLY I WACHED IT OVER FOR THE LAST QUESTION OVER TO MY WITNESSES WELL- MEANS- IRVINE- AND I ALSO SHOULD MENTION THAT. WE ARE ACTUALLY PLANNING TO HAVE THIS BILL RUN FOR THE DMV SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HERE IS THAT THE DMV UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THIS BILL- WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO APPROVE A VIS. UNLESS THEY WERE ALSO EXAMS- BUT AS FAR AS THEIR BE QUESTION I WOULD. THAT TO MS IRVINE AND ALSO IF SHE HAS ANY RESPONSES TO- SENTIMENT AS WELL. ABSOLUTELY MISS IRVINE MISTER MODERATOR. TO HAVE MISSED IRVINE ON THE LINE. I DO AND HER LINE OF OVER. THANK THANK YOU SENATOR- YOU KNOW I THINK YOU'VE COME THIS WELL- I WISHED AFTER. THE POINT THAT ALREADY MADE- AROUND- THE LEADING COMPANIES WHO ARE ALREADY. DOING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THEIR TESTING ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND STANDARDIZED AGAIN THAT WE'RE WE'RE FOCUSED ON DEPLOYMENTS- RATHER THAN TESTING TO GIVE COMPANIES THE OPPORTUNITY- TO DEVELOP THEIR TECHNOLOGIES- AND GRACES. DATE CARBON TWENTY THIRTY- REGULATION THAT IS SPECIFIC TO RIDE HAILING- SO THAT'S. A COOPER AND REST ON THAT DAY- REGULATION AND THAT UNDER CONSIDERATION NOW- AND YOU KNOW ONE OF KEY CAN. IN THAT REGULATION HAS. RELATED TO- THE CONCERN OF PUTTING- THE HI OF TRANSITIONING TO EITHER ON CUBA INCOME DRAW WHO DRIVE FOR THIS BY- WHICH IS NOT A CONCERN THAT WE HAVE- WE'RE THE AT AUTOMATED VEHICLES. OKAY THANK YOU MAY IRVINE AND I HOPE THAT DOES THAT SATISFY YOUR MISTER MAKER YES IT LOOK FOR TO AUTHOR ABOUT. THAT WHICH WOULD RIGHT DATE IS GOING FOR BUT I SUPPORT OF THE SLUDGE. THANK YOU SO STREET. OKAY SEE NO OTHER OR CALL FROM AT TIME WANT TO JUST YOU SENATE MAN I KNOW WE TALKED AT LENGTH ABOUT THE AB EV'S. AND YOUR PICKING IT UP CERTAINLY AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR LEAD WITNESSES BOTH IN SUPPORT AND IN OPPOSITION AND I KNOW YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL WITH THAT SAID WHAT CAN WE ENTERTAIN A MOTION FOR SB. FIVE HUNDRED. SENATOR BAKER OKAY GREAT SENATOR BECKER- MOVES THE BILL SB FIVE HUNDRED. MISTER CHIEF CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. THE DALLAS HI BILLS AYE BATES. HELLO ARCHULETA HI BARTLETT HIGH BAKER BY HI CORTESE ALL RIGHT CORTESE I TELL. DOT ALL RIGHT DONNA HI MCGUIRE MELENDEZ. HI MAN I NEWMAN. RUBIO SKINNER NUMBER HI NUMBER GUY CASKEY BOOK. SEVEN ZERO. SEVEN ZERO SENATOR MEN WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS AND JUST TO REMIND MEMBERS PLEASE RETURN TO THE HEARING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WILL BE LIFTING THE CALLS AND FINISH- WE HAVE TWO MORE BILLS TO END UP WITH THE- THANK YOU SENATOR MEANT. ALL RIGHT NEXT WE WILL GO TO SENATOR NEWMAN FOR SB SIX TWENTY THREE WELCOME SATURDAY NEWMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB SIX TO THREE. WHICH CLARIFIES EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW TO ENSURE THAT TOLL OPERATORS ACROSS THE STATE ARE ABLE TO PROMPTLY NOTIFY DRIVERS ABOUT ROAD CLOSURES AND OTHER CHANGES AS WELL AS TO GENERALLY CONDUCT THEIR OPERATIONS WITHOUT FEAR. OF COSTLY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF AMBIGUITY SURROUNDING THE USE OF DRIVERS INFORMATION OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THE TOLL AGENCIES ARE ABLE TO PROPERLY NOTIFY ACCOUNT HOLDERS ABOUT EMERGENCY ALERTS AND ROAD CLOSURES. TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES TO OBTAIN CONTACT INFORMATION TO PROCESS TOLL VIOLATIONS AND TOLL INVOICES AND COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER TO PROPERLY BILL CUSTOMERS WHO HOLD AN ACCOUNT. WITH A DIFFERENT WHOLE AGENCY BUT USE THE ROADS IN ANOTHER IN SO DOING THIS BILL ALSO ENDEAVORS TO ENHANCE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR CALIFORNIA DRIVERS TO PREVENT THE USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. BY CLARIFYING AND TIGHTENING EXISTING REGULATIONS PROHIBITING THE MARKETING AND SALE OF PERSONAL DATA CURRENT STATE LAW GOVERNING THE USE OF CONSUMER DATA BY OLL AGENCIES WAS ORIGINALLY PUT IN PLACE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR THE MANNER IN WHICH HALL FACILITY OPERATORS. CAN PROCESS TOLL VIOLATIONS AND COMMUNICATE INFORMATION WITH CUSTOMERS AND OTHER TOLL OPERATORS IN TWENTY TEN STATE SENATOR JOSEPH COMMITTEE AND AUTHORED SB TWELVE SIXTY EIGHT. WHICH ENDEAVOR TO ENSURE THE PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR CALIFORNIA DRIVERS WERE CODIFIED IN STATUTE AND APPLIED TO ALL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES THAT EITHER DID AT THAT TIME- MIGHT AT SOME POINT THE FUTURE. DEPLOY ELECTRONIC DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE PURPOSES OF ADMINISTERING THE TOLL AND VEHICLE TRACKING SYSTEMS THAT BILL WHICH PASSED AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PATCH AFTER IT WENT INTO EFFECT IN TWENTY ELEVEN EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES FROM SELLING. OR OTHERWISE PROVIDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO WHICH THEY MIGHT HAVE ACCESS SUCH AS DRIVERS ADDRESSES TELEPHONE NUMBERS BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION CREDIT CARD DATA OR TRAVEL PATTERNS UNDER THAT LEGISLATION NO TIME WAS THE INTENT TO PROHIBIT ANY CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION AGENCY FROM USING DRIVER DATA. TO PERFORM FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING FUNCTIONS SUCH AS BILLING ACCOUNT SETTLEMENT ENFORCEMENT OTHER FINANCIAL. ACTIVITIES REQUIRED TO OPERATE MANAGE TOLD FACILITIES NOR WAS THE INTENT TO BE. AN TRANSFER H. FROM COME. WITH AND ROLLED. ABOUT PRO SERVICES OR IMPENDING CHANGES. WOULD PROHIBIT A TRANSFER. AGENCY FROM PROVIDING AGGREGATED TRAVEL INFORMATION DERIVED FROM COLLECTED DATA FROM WHICH THE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION VINTAGE DRIVERS HAD ALREADY BEEN REMOVED. OR FURTHER TO PROHIBIT ONE TRANSPORTATION AS YOU FROM SHARING DATA WITH ANOTHER IN ORDER TO STANDARDIZED PLATFORMS SO AS TO FACILITATE INTER OPERABILITY ELECTRONIC TOLL COLLECTION DEVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES. TO THE DRIVERS CAN FREELY MOVE ACROSS CALIFORNIA'S VARIOUS TOLD THAT WORKS WELL USING THE SAME TRANSPONDERS. INDEED IN PUTTING FOR THE ORIGINAL EDGES SOLUTION CENTERS MILLION EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGED IN HIS AUTHOR STATEMENT. THAT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS DUE OUT TO OUR BRAVE TO SHARE DATA THE WAY THEY DO CURRENTLY. SO THAT SUBSCRIBERS WITH AN ACCOUNT ONE JURISDICTION CAN USE A TOLL FACILITY OPERATED BY DIFFERENT AGENCY. WHILE ENSURING THAT THE SAME PRIVACY PROTECTIONS APPLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW TOLL ROAD MONITORING BILLINGS BILLING SYSTEMS WORK THIS OF COURSE MAKES EMINENTLY GOOD SENSE TOLL AGENCIES NEED TO SHARE LICENSE PLATE AND OR TOOL. TRANSACTION INFORMATION IN A WIDE RANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES. INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING. COMMUNICATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES TO FIND APPROPRIATE CONTACT INFORMATION TO NOTIFY DRIVERS IN PROCESS TOLL VIOLATIONS. THE SENDING OF TOLL NOTICES TO DRIVERS THROUGHOUT THE THROUGH THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE. COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER TOLL AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THE DRIVERS WHO TRAVEL TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS USING THEIR FASTRACK ACCOUNTS. ARE PROPERLY BUILDING THEIR COUNTS PROPERLY DEBIT. UNFORTUNATELY RECENT LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS WITH RESPECT TO PRIVACY IN THIS LEGISLATION HAVE LEFT TRANSPORTATION QUARTER AGENCIES EXPOSED TO LITIGATION. ASSEMBLY PURSUING THE NORMAL OPERATION OF THEIR BUSINESSES EVEN THOUGH TOTAL AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE OF IN MAKING GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO PROTECT DRIVERS PRIVACY WHILE COLLECTING TOLLS. THESE PUBLIC AGENCIES TOO OFTEN FIND THEMSELVES BEING SUED FOR SIMPLY DOING THEIR JOBS IN THE PROCESS INCURRING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LEGAL FEES. THAT COULD MUCH BETTER BE SPENT ON ROAD PROJECTS OR SERVICING THEIR DEBT. USING THE TOLL ROADS ORANGE COUNTY AS EXAMPLE DURING LAST YEAR'S SPATE OF DANGEROUS AND UNPREDICTABLE WILDFIRES IN OUR REGION. OUR LOCAL TO LAZY WAS SO CAN ABOUT THE VERY REAL PROSPECT OF BEING SO. THAT THEY ULTIMATELY DECIDED AGAINST SENDING ROAD ALERT TO THEIR OWN ACCOUNT HOLDERS CURRENTLY THERE SIX LAWSUIT IN PROGRESS AGAINST VARIOUS TOLL AGENCIES FOR PRIVACY CONCERNS. SB SIX TO THREE MAINTAINS PRIVACY PROTECTION WHILE CLARIFYING THE LAW. TO THAT OUR STATE'S PUBLIC TOLL AGENCIES CAN CONDUCT OPERATIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF MERITLESS BUT NONE THE LESS COSTLY CONTINUOUS LITIGATION. SB SIXTY THREE STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE OF MAINTAINING STRONG PRIVACY PROTECTIONS WHILE CLARIFYING THE LAWS OR STATE PUBLIC TOLL AGENCIES CONCERNED ROAD CLOSURE ALERT. TO ACCOUNT HOLDERS COMMUNICATE WITH THE DMV AND PROVIDE INTEROPERABLE DO SO FAST TRACK USERS CAN DRIVE ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. AND COUNTY AND COUNTY SEAMLESSLY. THE BILL LEAVES INTACT THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR PER VIOLATION PENALTY AGAINST HOLY JEEZ IF THEY BY THE LAW. AND IT IS DECLARATIVE OF EXISTING LIGHT IS NOT RETROACTIVE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT LEGAL DISTINCTION AND ONE THAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO HEAR MISREPRESENTED AS YOU CONSIDER THE BILL. BEFORE YOU TODAY. THIS BILL HAS SUPPORT FROM BOTH LABOR AND TRANSPORTATION STAKEHOLDERS AND I WANT TO THANK BOTH THE CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE STAFFER PARTICIPATE IN NUMEROUS MEETINGS WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED WITH THIS IMPORTANT BILL. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DIALOGUE WITH STAFF SUPPORT OPPOSITION AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY VIRTUALLY. I SAMUEL JOHNSON THE CEO OF THE TRANSCRIPTION QUARTER AGENCIES AND REBEKAH LONG FROM THE BAY AREA TOLL AUTHORITY TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN WILL GO TO MISTER MODERATOR. AND WE'LL START WITH MR JOHNSON PLEASE. THANK YOU A LINE OF OPEN. HI GOOD MORNING ON DOLLAR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS SAMUEL AND I SAID HE TO TRANSFER CORPORATION WHICH OPERATES FOR TOLL ROADS IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT REPRESENT SYSTEM I VERY MUCH LIKE TO THANK CENTER NEWMAN FOR DRESSING THIS CRITICAL MATTER BY OFFERING SB SIX TWENTY THREE OF WHICH AS HE NOTED IS MEANT TO CLARIF THAT TOLL FACILITIES ARE MADE EACH YEAR NECESSARY INFORMATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES IN THE DMV FOR TOLL COLLECTION ENFORCEMENT. A STATE LAW MANDATES THAT TOLL FACILITIES ARE INTRACTABLE MEETING A CUSTOMER ONLY NEEDS ONE ACCOUNT TO BE ABLE TO USE ANY FACILITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN ORDER TO DO SO TOLD AGENCIES NEEDED BILLION SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHER TOLL OPERATORS AS WAS NOTED HELLO LADIES OF THE STATE ARE THE TARGET OF NEWMAN CLASS LAW. BY CONSUMER JOURNEY SPORTS- THAT FORMER CENTER MEDIA PUT ALLEGING SHARING OF IDENTIFY- IN. I HAVE THE NOTE- CENTERS IN INTENSE AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS TWELVE SIXTY EIGHT WAS VERY CLEAR IT WAS NOT INTO TO BRING OUR DAILY OP. ANY CALL FOR. TO THE BILL OUR- AT A LOSS THAT WE ARE FOR AREN'T OUR TO WITH CUSTOMERS EMERGING SAID- THAT THE CENTER AND IS VERY FOR T. IMMUNITY WE WE'RE TRYING TO HELP MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC DURING CHALLENGE. TIMES WE- DURING THE FALL OF TWENTY TWO IN DEALING WITH Y. AND NOT BEING ABLE INFORM OUR CUSTOMER AND MEMBERS THE ABOUT ROAD CLOSURES AND EVACUATION DUE TO CONCERNS REGARDING LITIGATION RISK SO SB TWENTY SIXTY THREE THANK YOU WOULD REALLY HELP US IN THIS REGARD- AS NOTED IT MAINTAINS EXISTING PRIVACY LAWS THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN ASSOCIATED. PENALTIES WHILE ALSO IN A DANCING INTERNET RESEARCH. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE OF BANKING AND I RISK BUT YOUR- GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TEST. WHERE MOVE ON MS LAW. A RELATIONS MANAGER MUCH OF CHIU. COMMISSION AS LONG. AS GOVERNMENT REALLY FOR THE BAY AREA TOLL AUTHORITY ABOUT IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TOLL COLLECTION ON THE BAY AREA SEVEN STATE OWNED TOLL BRIDGES AND PROVIDES CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE AND GROWING NETWORK AND EXPRESSLY. THAT IS PROUD CO SPONSOR OF SB SIX TWENTY THREE WHICH CLARIFIES THAT EXISTING LAW PERMITS TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES TO SHARE BASIC PLATE NUMBERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF IDENTIFYING REGISTERED OWNERS SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE NOTICES TOLD AND COLLECT UNPAID TOLLS AND PENALTIES. WHEN I TRY TO USE AS A TOLL FACILITY WITHOUT PAYING THE TOLL TOLL AGENCIES THE CONTENT TO RECOUP THE TOLD BY SENDING MOTORISTS TO NOTICE. TO LOCATE THE NAME AND CURRENT ADDRESS OF THE REGISTERED OWNER TOLD AGENCIES ARE AUTHORIZED TO REQUEST ACCESS TO THE DMV'S REGISTRATION DATABASE. SHARING THE LICENSE PLATE WITH THE DMV IS A KEY STEP IN THAT PROCESS. THE CLAIM THAT THIS IS A PRIVACY VIOLATION FLIES IN THE FACE OF COMMONSENSE AS WELL AS THE TWENTY TEN BILL. WHICH STATED ITS RESTRICTIONS WOULD NOT PROHIBIT ACTIONS NECESSARY TO OPERATE AND MANAGE THE TOLL COLLECTION SYSTEM. UNFORTUNATELY THAT PROVISION WHICH WAS INTENDED TO ENSURE THE CONTINUITY OF OUR OPERATIONS HAS NOT PREVENTED LAWSUIT AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM DIVERTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE TREE STATE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. INCLUDING SB SIX TWENTY THREE WILL PROVIDE A MUCH NEEDED CLARITY CLARITY ABOUT THE LAWFUL WAYS IN WHICH TOLD AGENCIES MAY USE INFORMATION WHILE ALSO PERFECT PRESERVING PRIVACY PROTECTIONS THAT PROHIBIT THE SALE OR IMPROPER DISCLOSURE. IS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND STRENGTHENING PRIVACY POLICY REQUIREMENTS BY REQUIRING THAT THEY DISCLOSE HOW THE CUSTOMER MAY OPT IN AND REVOKE CONSENT TO RECEIVING INFORMATION. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT SB SIX TWENTY THREE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY.

SB THREE THREE NINE IS THE GAS TAX ALTERNATIVE PILOT THAT WILL EXTEND THE ROAD CHARGE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FROM TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. THE PILOT IT WAS CREATED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IT WAS ADMINISTERED BY THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY IN THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND ALLOW FOR THE STUDY OF AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE GAS TAX. A ROAD USER CHARGE HER CHARGE FOR DRIVERS BASED ON THE MILES THEY TRAVEL CURRENTLY AS YOU ALL KNOW THE GAS TAX- WE HAVE IN PLACE FUNDS ARE HIGHWAYS. OR LOCAL ROADS STREETS PUBLIC TRANSIT IS WELL HOWEVER THIS TAX IS NOT A LONGER TERM VIABLE SOLUTION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. PUT THE REVENUE BASED SOLELY ON GASOLINE CONSUMPTION ANY POLICIES WE IMPLEMENT THE LOWER VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED OR INCREASE OVERALL FUEL EFFICIENCY OF VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA ALL GOOD THINGS BY THE WAY IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. WILL THEN REDUCE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING FOR ROADS HIGHWAYS BRIDGES AND PUBLIC TRANSIT. OF COURSE THEY NEED TO FIND OUR ROADS HIGHWAYS AND TRANSIT SYSTEMS WON'T CHANGE. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES PUT WEAR AND TEAR ON OUR ROADS AND HIGHWAYS JUST LIKE GAS BURNING VEHICLES DO AS WELL. YET INCREASE FUEL EFFICIENCY- DESIRABLE AS IT IS WILL ALTERNATELY AT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE AVAILABLE FUNDS TO INVEST IN OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IN FINER TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE WE MUST TRANSITION FROM A GAS TAX REFORM OF A ROAD USER CHARGE SB THREE THREE NINE ALLOWS FOR THE FURTHER STUDY. AT THIS CRUCIAL POLICY.

THIS SECOND GROUP WELL IT WAS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT EVEN WHEN TRANSITIONING TO ROAD USERS USER CHARGE. THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO PURCHASE A MORE FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLE AS CURRENTLY SEEN WITH THE GAS TAX WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE. MEMBERS THIS IS A VOLUNTARY INITIATIVE. TO COMPARE THESE TWO PARTICIPANTS THE CDC IS TASKED WITH REPORTING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE COMPARING AND CONTRASTING THE TWO RATES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE STATE'S CLIMATE.
