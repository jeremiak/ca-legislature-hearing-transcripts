GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK. I. WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY SEVEN THE REGARDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COASTAL ZONE. AND BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF OF COURSE FOR. A OF THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS ACOSTA COMMISSION STAFF AND OUR SPONSORS HAVE ALL BEEN HARD AT WORK ON THIS BILL. AT AS YOU KNOW MAY KNOW A RECENT TWENTY SIXTEEN COURT CASE THAT COUNT NOW GARDENS VERSUS CITY OF LOS ANGELES CASE. HAS UNDERMINED THE APPLICATION OF BOTH MELLOW AND DENSITY BONUS ALONG THE COASTAL ZONE. IN COUNT NOW A DEVELOPER PROPOSED A SMALL RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE VENICE AREA OF LOS ANGELES THAT INCLUDED AFFORDABLE UNITS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE MELLOW ACT. AND THE DANCE OF THE BOOK AND QUALIFY FOR DENSITY BONUS UNDER STATE LAW. AND ALTHOUGH THE PROJECT WAS CONSISTENT WITH BOTH LOCAL PLANNING AND ZONING AND THE DENSITY BONUS LAW THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DENIED THE PROJECTS ON THE BASIS THAT THE INCREASED DENSITY. MADE THE PROJECT VISUALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD IN VIOLATION OF THE COASTAL ACT. UNFORTUNATELY THE APPELLATE COURT UPHELD THE DENIAL. FINDING THAT COASTAL ACT SUPERSEDES DENSITY BONUS LAW. AND IF NOT CORRECTED THIS DECISION WILL LIKELY PREVENT DENSITY BONUS LAW FROM BEING USED IN THE COASTAL ZONE. AND UNDERMINE THE PRESERVATION PRODUCTION OF HOUSING UNDER THE MELLOW ACT. AT THE END RESULT WILL BE FEWER AFFORDABLE UNITS WITHIN THE COASTAL ZONE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN. ARE NOT REALLY. AFFORD AT THIS POINT IN TIME. I AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY SEVEN WILL CLARIFY  <u><c.green>PROVISION IN</c></u> DENSITY BONUS LAW TO ENSURE THAT A PROJECT. CANNOT BE FOUND INCONSISTENT WITH THE COASTAL ACT MERLY BECAUSE IT RECEIVES A DENSITY INCREASE UNDER STATE LAW. WE'VE WORKED VERY DILIGENTLY TO ADDRESS ALL THE CONCERNS SAID THAT COASTAL COMMISSION HAVE WITH THIS BILL. AND TELL THEY ARE NOW NEUTRAL I'M A GRATEFUL FOR THAT THANK YOU AND ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU JUST TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO ITEMS TODAY WE THOUGHT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE FILE ITEM TO WHICH IS WHAT I ANNOUNCED.

OTHER MISTER BLOOM MENTIONED SERVE UPSET THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE DENSITY BONUS LAW AND THE COASTAL ACT. AND AS WE WORK. AS A STATE TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IT'S CRITICAL. TO ENSURE THAT. WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAXIMIZE AFFORDABLEHOUSING PRODUCTION IN. COASTAL CITIES. THIS BILL WILL MAKE SURE THAT DENSELY BONUS ALL REMAINS. A TOOL IN WHICH A VIABLE TOOL FOR ACHIEVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COASTAL ZONE WE THINK. HAVING WORKED WITH THE COSTA COMMISSION THAT WE HAVE. REESTABLISH THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO AND. FOR THAT REASON WE WOULD URGE AYE VOTE AND MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I MAY JUST ALSO NOTE.

BURGER DOT I WOULD ASK WHEN ABOUT AGREED. IT'S A GOOD WAY TO TRY TO HUNT FOR VOTES ON THIS COMMITTEE YEAH.

JENNIFER SPEC ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT. SEAN DEPICTING WITH CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. PARA BUCKLEY ON BEHALF HOUSING CALIFORNIA ALSO SPORT. WE NOW ASK IF THERE IS OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING CHO JONES FOR THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL PROTECTION AT WORK THIS MORNING WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ARE WORKING REALLY HARD ON THE AMENDMENTS I HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR IT. AND THAT THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE WORKING GOT SICK FURTHER CLARIFY THE BILL I WITH THE CLOSENESS BUT CCP AND DOESN'T WANT IS FOR THERE TO BE ANY SORT OF. A LOOP HOLES ARE IN THERE TO ALLOW FOR LUXURY DEVELOPMENT TO GO UNDER THE GUISE OF AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT AND NOW WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING BOUT WITH EVERYBODY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU LISTENERS ANY OTHER OPPOSITION WE CAN BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THERE'S A MOTION TO MOVE IS OUR SECOND. I WILL SECOND IT. ARM LET ME SAY A FEW THINGS ON THE THANK. THE AUTHOR. FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE COSTA COMMISSION ON AMENDMENTS. I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT ENCOURAGING HOUSING CREATION DEVELOPMENT ON OUR COASTAL REGIONS IS OFTEN A. DELICATE BALANCING ACT BETWEEN OUR NEED FOR MORE HOUSING AND THE UNIQUE NATURAL RESOURCES ON OUR COASTAL AREAS. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S CONCERNED ABOUT THE RECENT COURT CASE AND THE CONFUSION THAT MAY BE CAUSING. AND I DO THINK AT THIS TIME THIS BILL IS A BALANCED APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE SO I HAVE A AND I RECOMMENDATION. ILUSTRES ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION. WELL AS THE AUTHOR OF ANY FINAL COMMENTS. THANK YOU I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE OKAY OTHERS BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND. MADAM SECRETARY COULD CALL THE ROLL FOR NOW. MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED INVADER REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES SHOOTS AYE CHIU AYE. MAIENSCHEIN HI MAIENSCHEIN AYE CHAU. CHOI. GLORIA. GLORIA AYE WE MONTH. WOULD. THE THREE VOTES YOU NEED ONE MORE TO GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL OBVIOUSLY HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR. OTHER MEMBERS TO JOIN ON LET'S GO NOW BACK TO FILE ITEM TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ALL REMAIN OPTIMISTIC ON THAT BILL BECAUSE IT'LL BE GOOD TO GET BACK ON THE WITH IN THE WIN COLUMN IN THIS COMMITTEE. I'M GOING TO PRESENT TO AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE NOW. I AM AND I'LL ALSO BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. ARE ON ON THIS BILL TO. OUR OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS FROM LAST YEAR INCLUDING A. B. THIRTEEN NINETY SEVEN OF WHICH I WAS A JOINT AUTHOR. S. B. THIRTY FIVE IN A NUMBER OF OTHER BILLS IN THE HOUSING PACKAGE MEAN VERY LITTLE. IF OUR STATE RINA ALLOCATIONS ARE NOT EQUITABLE AND DATA DRIVEN. FAIR AND ACCURATE RINA ALLOCATIONS THAT ENSURE EVERY LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS PLAYING A PART IN ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS IS THE MAIN GOAL OF AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE. THE EXISTING PROCESS TOO OFTEN IGNORES THAT DATA THAT DATA AND ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PUSH BACK TO WHAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH. RATHER THAN WHAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH OUR ACTIONS A ACCOMMODATE WITH CHANGES IN THEIR ZONING. IN AN EFFORT TO ADD AN INDEPENDENT VOICE AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE ADDS EIGHT EIGHT CD TO THE RAIN A PROCESS. THIS ALLOWS THEM TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DISTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW BEFORE THE NUMBERS ARE EVEN RUN SO THAT THE COG CAN MAKE ANY NEEDED CHANGES WHEN. THEY DO THEIR ANALYSIS. THE EXISTING PROCESS PROVIDES A LOOPHOLE THAT CAN ALLOW POLITICS TO OVERWRITE PROCESS Y INCLUDING LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS FOR A COG TO ADD. ANY OTHER FACTORS TO THEIR DISTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY. THIS BILL NARROWS THAT DEFINITION AND I IN NO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY VAGUE. TERM MANY OTHER FACTORS SO WE NARROW THE DEFINITION. OF WHAT. CONSISTS OF ANY OTHER FACTORS SO THAT. ACOG CAN REQUIRE THAT ALL FACTORS BECAUSE ACOG WILL REQUIRE THAT ALL FACTORS BE CONSISTENT WITH THE GOALS OF THE STATUTE. THIS BILL ALLOWS ORGANIZATIONS TO CHALLENGE RINA NUMBERS AS WELL AS SURROUNDING JURISDICTIONS RIGHT NOW. ONLY THE JURISDICTION THAT IS ASSIGNED ARENA NUMBER CAN CHALLENGE AND AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. THAT RARELY IF EVER HAPPENS IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT RING THAT SETS HOUSING ALLOCATION FLOORS NOT A CEILING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. GREEN AS A PLANNING TOOL THAT IS CRITICAL TO SETTING THE STAGE FOR HOUSING PRODUCTION. IF THE PROCESS IS FLAWED THAT WE DON'T GET HOUSING IN THE PLACES WHERE IT'S NEEDED MOST AND SOME CITIES UNFORTUNATELY DO NOT HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE. TO ADDRESSING REGIONAL HOUSING UNITS. WHEN JOB RICH DISTRIBUTIONS DON'T HAVE TO PLAN FOR HOUSING IT COMPROMISES ARE ABILITY TO MAYOR CLAVICLES AS WELL. THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON GETTING AN EQUITABLE REDISTRIBUTION WITHIN REGIONS THAT ENSURES THAT EVERY JURISDICTION IS DOING ITS FAIR SHARE. THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISTER RELIGIOUS WANNA PROVIDE YOU'RE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS EGGMAN GREAT THANK YOU. TO YOUR SUPPORTERS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ON THE LAWLER ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY ONE OF THE SPONSORS. COMPANIES COUSIN CHRIS IS WELL DOCUMENTED WE TALK ABOUT IT IN THIS COMMITTEE QUITE A BIT. OTHER IT'S A THE CRISIS ARE COMPLEX AND THERE'S BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT SUPPLY PLAYS A ROLE WE NEED TO PRODUCE FARMER HOUSING THAT WE HAVE BEEN AND PARTICULARLY HOUSING FOR AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WHERE THE CURRENT SHORTAGE IS ACUTE. ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION UNITS. RIGHT NOW ACCORDING TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. BUT IN ADDITION TO PAVING THE WAY FOR MORE PRODUCTION WE ALSO NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE THE HOUSING IS ACTUALLY NEEDED AND ENSURE THAT THOSE PLACES ARE PROVIDING AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THAT PRODUCTION TO HAPPEN. THIS IS WHERE THE RAIN COMES IN. I WAS ADVISED THAT CITY BY A WISE CALLING TO AVOID ACRONYMS BECAUSE EVERYBODY HATES THEM BUT. I MANY IS THIS ONE FOR THE SAKE OF BREVITY AND BECAUSE OF THE TERM YOU CAN HEAR A LOT THIS YEAR. RINA MERELY SERVES SHORTHAND FOR TWO RELATED THINGS THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION PROCESS. THE STATE DOES THE ASSESSMENT PART EVERY EIGHT YEARS A DETERMINES HOW MANY HOUSING UNIT THE REGION NEEDS TO PLAN FOR. IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE CALCULATION HOW MANY HOUSING UNITS ARE YOU GONNA NEED AT THE END OF THE EXPLAINING PERIOD MINUS HOW MANY HOUSING UNITS YOU HAVE NOW THAT'S GOING TO BE HELPED PLAN FROM THE REGION. THAT NUMBER THEN GOES TO THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS FOR THE REGION WHICH HAVE TO ALLOCATE A SHARE OF THE REGION HOUSING NEED TO EVERY CITY AND COUNTY IN THE REGION. THIS IS THERE IN A PROCESS THAT THAT ISSUE IN THIS BILL HAVING IT OUT GETS ALLOCATED WITHIN A REGION IS CRUCIAL TO SETTING THE STAGE FOR A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN PREPARING THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH SAFE ZONE FOR HOUSING WHERE THEIR. ENTIRE SHARE THE RITA COULD BE BUILT. THE LAW RECOGNIZES THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES GENERALLY ARE NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE THROUGH THEIR ZONING POWERS IN SETTING THE STAGE FOR DEVELOPMENT TO HAPPEN. THE LAW PROVIDES NUMEROUS PROTECTIONS FOR HOUSING PROJECTS IS MISTER BLOOM NOTED BOTH AFFORDABLE AND MARKET A PROJECTS THAT ARE PROPOSED UNSAFE THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ZONED FOR HOUSING THESE PROTECTIONS OR ENHANCE LAST YEAR THROUGH A NUMBER OF BILLS AND HOUSING PACKAGE. ESSENTIALLY OF DEVELOPER PROPOSES A HOUSING PROJECT IN A LOCATION WHERE COMMUNITY HAS PLANNED FOR HOUSING IT'S VERY VERY HARD FOR THAT PROJECT TO GET TONIGHT NOW. HOWEVER IT NONE THESE LAWS CAN COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING IN PLACES WHERE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO THE PLANS ON FOR HOUSING OF A JURISDICTION GET THE LOW REMAIN NUMBER THAT EFFECTIVELY MEANS THE JURISDICTION CAN SHUT THE DOOR FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FOR THE NEXT DECADE. EVEN EVEN IF IT'S AN IDEAL LOCATION FOR NEW HOUSING. THIS IS WHY IT'S SO CRITICAL TO GET THE REALLOCATION RIGHT WHEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ALLOCATED AND A DATA DRIVEN WAY THAT MEANS A VARIETY OF CRITICAL STATUTORY GOALS SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE. REDUCING CLIMATE CHANGE UNFORTUNATELY REGIONAL POLITICS OFTEN TAKES OVER RESULTING IN LOW ALLOCATIONS TO CITIES THAT COULD AND NEED TO ACCOMMODATE MORE HOUSING BASED ON A LACK OF WILL RATHER THAN ACTUAL DATA. THE GOAL HERE IS NOT TO BURDEN THE COGS OR CREATE MORE WORK THIS IS ALREADY A LOT OF WORK FOR THEM WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOAL IS TO TAKE THE POLITICS OUT ENSURE THAT WERE PLANNING FOR HOUSING IN THE RIGHT PLACES AND. THAT COMMUNITIES ARE DOING THEIR FAIR SHARE. IT'S A COMPLICATED TOPIC BUT IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND WE ASK FOR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU BRINING US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SAID SO I'LL JUST URGING AYE VOTE THANK YOU GREAT LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS ARE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM IN SUPPORT. MOVES STEADY GEORGE WITH MY PLANE ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. TARA BUCKLEY ON BEHALF OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT. AND WE ASK IF THERE'S ANY OPPOSITION. HI BILL HIGGINSON THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENTS ARE THE COGS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RENO DISTRIBUTION WE APPRECIATE THE INITIAL AMENDMENT BECAUSE THAT. HELPED ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. AND I'D LIKE TO JUST KIND OF RAISE A COUPLE OF LARGER ISSUES ABOUT WHY WE'VE TAKEN THIS POSITION. AND THE FIRST IS RECONCILIATION THE COGS. WHEN WE DISTRIBUTE THE RENO RIGHT NOW. THE RENO DISTRIBUTION IS SPECIFICALLY TIED TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGET. AND IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE IN SOME CASES THE A EQUITY DISTRIBUTION MAY BE ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH THE GHG REDUCTION AND IN SOME CASES IT MAY NOT. AND IF THERE'S A SITUATION WHERE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE AT WITH THE FACTORS. IT'S GOING TO REQUIRED A A DISTRIBUTION. THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE NEED TO ACHIEVE THE MAXIMUM GHG REDUCTION WE NEED SOME KIND OF RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO. BECAUSE WE'RE PRETTY SURE THAT A A RP IS NOT GOING TO GIVE A REDUCTION BASED ON THAT BECAUSE WE TELEMEDICINE. SO THIS LAW. BECAUSE THE RINA IS TIED TO THE RESULT TRANSPORTATION PLAN NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT THAT SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT. THE SPONSORS OF BEEN SYMPATHETIC TO THAT IN OUR INITIAL CONVERSATION SO WE HOPE THAT WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS. ANOTHER THING THAT WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH IS INTRODUCING NEW PEOPLE INTO THE APPELLATE TIMELINE. IN THIS CASE HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS WHEN WE NEGOTIATED S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE THE JXD LA THE. TWENTY SIX MONTHS LEADING UP TO A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN ADOPTION. WAS CAREFULLY TIMELINE IN ANY. DELAY IN THAT PROCESS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO WHO ADOPTED RTP AND ALL THE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS RELATED TO THAT ON TIME WITH THE FEDERAL HIGHWAYS ADMINISTRATION TIMELINES OR POST. SO EVEN THOUGH DESERVED TO. ADDRESSING VERY IMPORTANT FACTORS. THERE ARE SOME SIDE EFFECTS TO THIS BILL THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT SO BEFORE WE CAN REMOVE OUR. OPPOSITION AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY ANY OTHER OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY SCENE NON LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. MISTER GORE. I THINK WAS CHAIRMAN IT FIGURES TO BLOOM FOR THIS BILL. AYE AT AND KNOWLEDGE OF THIS OR POINT OUT THIS IS THE FIRST HEARING FOR THIS BILL AND I KNOW. IS MENTIONED IN THE LOT HARD WORK I DON'T THINK WHICH HE BLAMES AFRAID OF DOING HARD WORK SO. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS WOULD MEAN THIS BILL. IT RESONATE WITH MY EXPERIENCES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SERVING ON A COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS AND EVERYTHING OF THE WITNESSES MENTIONED WHERE THINGS I PERSONALLY OBSERVED I MENTIONED THAT IS TRUE ACROSS THE STATE. OUR MAGIC AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESSING THIS HUGE DEFICIT THAT WE HAVE ANY MORE HOUSING WE HAVE IN THE STATE. I'M SITTING DATA DRIVEN TARGETS YOU KNOW THAT ARE THAT ARE LESS POLITICAL IN MORE ABOUT REALITY ON THE GROUND. THING MAKES A HECK OF A LOT OF SENSE I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AYE AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS TO JUST THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED WHICH I DON'T THINK ARE INSURMOUNTABLE AT ALL. ON BILLION APPRECIATION TO MISTER BLOOM AND I'M OF THE BILL. AS MOTION OF THE BILLS ARE SECOND OR. THERE'S A SECOND. ARM. BUT I JUST SAY I APPRECIATE YOU TACKLING THIS AREA THERE'S LAWLER MAY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THEM. RIGHT AND I THINK WE'RE LARGELY AGREEMENT ACTUALLY WITH TELL BECAUSE THAT THIS. WHATEVER WE DO ON RENO NEEDS TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S CHICHI REDUCTION GOALS AND NOT IMPEDE THEM SO WE THINK THAT THERE IS A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TO WORK TOGETHER WE THINK THAT'S CRITICAL. AND WE ALSO AGREE THAT EXTENDING THE TIMELINE WOULD HAVE ALL KINDS OF NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES IT WOULD DELAY RTP THAT WOULD PUT COGS BEEN IN TROUBLE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND IT WOULD ALSO. DELAY ADOPTION OF HOUSING ON INTO THE LOCAL LEVEL WHICH WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE AND SO WE REALLY. ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH FOLKS ON HOW DO WE SORT OF GETS MORE CHECKS AND BALANCES IN THIS PROCESS AND ENSURE THAT. PEOPLE CAN WEIGH IN AT THE APPROPRIATE STAGE AS WELL SO MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING GETS HEALED UP WHEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO SO MORTARBOARD LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE AS. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK MY BACKGROUND IS A FORMER MAYOR. AND FORMER CHAIR OF THE WEST SIDE CITY'S COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS EIGHTY FOUR TO THE COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHIU BY CHIU AYE MAIENSCHEIN AYE MAIENSCHEIN AYE CHAU. CHOI. GLORIA. GLORIA AYE. WE MON. WOULD. CITY. THANK YOU HAVE THREE VOTES YOU NEED ONE MORE. WILL BE WAITING FOR THEM THANK YOU. LET'S NOT MOVE TO MISTER THURMAN FOR FILE ITEM SEVEN AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT. WELCOME IS DIFFERENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN GOOD MORNING INTO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE ME START BY SAYING EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND IN THE TRADITION SET BY. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA MONICA I SHOULD PROFUSELY THANK THE STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR EXEMPLARY EXTRAORDINARY ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL DEPRECIATED. I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH ESTABLISHES A PROGRAM THAT WILL HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUILD AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING FOR TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. THIS BILL WILL HELP DISTRICTS BOTH URBAN AND RURAL RECRUIT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED TEACHERS. THE TEACHER HOUSING SHORT THE TEACHER SHORTAGE HAS BEEN WORSENED BY HOUSING CONCERNS IN HIGH COST AREA. LOW SALARIES NOT COVER HOUSING COSTS IN RULE SCHOOL DISTRICTS RECRUITING TEACHERS HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT. AND IN BOTH AREAS THE LONG COMMUTE FACED BY TEACHERS AND OTHER CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES FORCES MANY TO LEAVE THEIR POSITIONS. IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS REPORT A SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS. TEACHER HOUSING MODELS HAVE BEEN USED IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND SOME URBAN CALIFORNIA COMMITTEES LIKE CUPERTINO LOS ANGELES. BEFORE MANY DISTRICTS BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS NOT AN OPTION DO THEIR BUDGET CONSTRAINTS FURTHER FEDERAL STATE SUBSIDIZED HOUSING PROGRAMS HAD INCOME LEVEL REQUIREMENTS THAT OFTEN EXCLUDE TEACHERS. WELL HOUSING AS A FIRST STEP FOR MANY NEW TEACHERS ENTERING A COMMUNITY. AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT TEACHERS BECOMING PART OF SURROUNDING COMMUNITY LEADS TO BETTER RELATIONSHIPS WITH STUDENTS PARENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT IS WHY THIS BILL ULTIMATELY IS ABOUT QUALITY EDUCATION THROUGH. AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WITH ME TODAY TO ADD EMPHASIS IS MATTHEW DUFFY WHO WAS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF WEST CONTRA COSTA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. A DOMINANT DUTRA AND LEAH DENMAN WHO ARE WITH DCG STRATEGIES WERE WORKING WITH THE DISTRICT ON THEIR EFFORTS TO BUILD SCHOOL EMPLOYEE HOUSING. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE OF. THANK YOU YOUR WITNESSES. MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS MATTHEW DUFFY AND SUPER. WEST CONTRA COSTA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WE SERVE CLOSE TO THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. A LIFELONG EDUCATOR STARTING AS A TEACHER PRINCIPAL ADMINISTRATOR AND NOW SUPERINTENDENT. AND IF I WAS TO START TODAY I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I'D BE ABLE TO STAY IN THE BAY AREA. DUE TO THE HOUSING COSTS IN OUR DISTRICT WE LOSE ROUGHLY ONE FIFTH OF OUR TEACHING FORCE EACH YEAR AND IN LARGE PART IT'S DUE TO THE COST OF LIVING. THE ATTRITION RATES ARE PARTICULARLY HIGH OUR UNDERSERVED SCHOOLS WERE DISTRICT THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE IN THE BAY AREA SPREAD ACROSS SIX UNIQUE COMMUNITIES WITH SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS QUALIFYING FOR LOW INCOME. AND IN CERTAIN AREAS OF OUR DISTRICT SCHOOLS ARE NINETY FIVE TO A HUNDRED PERCENT LOW INCOME SO OUR TEACHER NEED IS ENORMOUS. ON OUR AND WE HAVE INCREASED COMPENSATION AND SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS BUT THAT'S ONLY PART OF THE EQUATION WE NEED INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS LIKE AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT. WE HAVE AVAILABLE LAND EDUCATORS WILLING TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE BUT OUR EXPERTISE IS EDUCATING CHILDREN NOT MOVING MULTI HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS THROUGH THE PROCESS. WE HAD ONE TEACHER LAST YEAR COMMUNITY LEAST NOW AND A HALF ONE WAY FROM SACRAMENTO TO RICHMOND. AB TWO SEVEN EIGHT EIGHT WILL HELP US AND WILL HELP THAT TEACHER LIVE IN HER COMMUNITY. OUR DISTRICT IS CONTINUING TO EXPLORE INNOVATIVE WAYS TO RETAIN OUR TEACHERS WERE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR CITIES ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR TEACHERS TO LIVE WORK AND PLAY. IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE BUT AGAIN WE NEED YOUR HELP NOT ONLY WILL AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT MAKE IT EASIER FOR US TO EXPLORE THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD MORE HOUSING. BUT IT ALSO OFFERS OUR TEACHERS A PATHWAY AND ASSISTANCE TO HOMEOWNERSHIP OUR TEACHERS NEED THIS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY OUR STUDENTS NEED OUR TEACHERS THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS. BOB DOMINIC USUALLY DCG STRATEGIES. SO JUST BRIEFLY I'D LIKE TO JUST SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO SEVEN EIGHT EIGHT. MY SIMPLY MEMBER THURMOND FIRST OF ALL. IT'S A VERY PERSONAL ISSUE BUT ALL PULSE OF SPEAK BRIEFLY FIRST ON OUR POLICY IN A PROFESSIONAL BASIS. THIS IS LIKE OLD HOME WEEK FOR ME MY DAD SERVED IN THE ASSEMBLY SO I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE. AND WHAT YOU CAN DO TO EFFECTUATE ODD GOOD POLICY IN OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALSO MYSELF SERVED ON TO TERMS ON THE FREMONT CITY COUNCIL WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO BRING TESLA TO WAS A FORMER CLOSE PLANT THE GM. KNEW ME PLAN TO GET PARK TO SAN JOSE SO. ON A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL TWELVE YEARS AGO I STARTED A FIRM DCG STRATEGIES TO WORK WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON. A SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE WAYS OF USING THEIR LAND. AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT AND AS A SUPERINTENDENT HAS NOTED SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF DEVELOPING. REAL PROPERTY BUT WHAT THEY HAVE FOUND IS THAT FROM THE RECRUITING AND RETENTION PERSPECTIVE. IT IS LITERALLY VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE TEACHER SHORTAGE TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT AND RETAIN THE STUDENTS. AND SO WE WORK WITH THEM AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY FOR THESE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO NOT FUNDS THAT THEY WILL ASK THE STATE TO KEEP WITHIN THEIR DISTRICT BUT LOANS PRE DEVELOPMENT LOANS. AND THE ABILITY TO HAVE GAP FINANCING PLEASE THINK A LOT OUT ALONG THE LINES OF S. B. EIGHT TYPE FINANCING. SOMETHING THAT HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO CAN FIND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THIS CONSTRUCTION BUT NEED SOME GAP FINANCING THAT THEY CAN REPAY OVER TIME. TO THE STATE THROUGH H. CD. AT ALL JUST CLOSE OUR PERSONAL LEVEL A SPEAKING ABOUT MY DAUGHTER WHO'S NOW A TEACHER. MY WIFE AND I ADOPTED MY DAUGHTER FROM FOSTER ADOPTIVE FOUR YEARS OLD AYE SHE HAD A VERY ROUGH. A BEGINNING OF HER LIFE AND AS A RESULT STRUGGLED. THROUGHOUT HER SCHOOL EXPERIENCE EFFECT WHEN SHE GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL. MY WIFE AND I DID NOT KNOW HOW SHE WAS EVEN GOING TO SUSTAIN HERSELF MOVING FORWARD SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS STUPID. SHE WASN'T STUPID. SHE HAD LOST CONFIDENCE BECAUSE OF FOR ROUGH BACKGROUND. SHE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO OUT AS A PART OF MY A ROLAND CITY COUNCIL TO GET INVOLVED CITY YOUR FEAR AND IF YOU KNOW CITY YEAR IT'S A NATIONAL SERVICE PROGRAM AND DID THAT FOR TWO YEARS. THROUGH THAT PROGRAM SHE WAS ABLE TO BE MENTORED. BY PEOPLE THAT. TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS NOT STUPID THAT IN FACT SHE WAS SOMEBODY THAT TOO HARD WORK COULD MAKE CHANGE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. SHE THEN WENT ON TO A JUNIOR COLLEGE CAREER TRANSFERRED TO BERKELEY GODDARD OUT BATCHES TO BE IN BERKELEY. MY MY WIFE AND MY KIDS ARE SPANDEX UP SO SHE DECIDED TO GO TO CHILE AND SPEND A YEAR ARE TEACHING SO THAT SHE CAN ARE LEARNED SPANISH FLUENTLY SHE CAME BACK TO THE UNITED STATES. DID TWO MORE YEARS THE NATIONAL SERVICE WITH TEACH FOR AMERICA. WHERE SHE ACTUALLY GOT HER ARM GRADUATE DEGREE? AND IS NOW WORKING AND AND AND OUR THIRTY YEARS A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER. ARE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY ALL SOUNDS LIKE A WONDERFUL. BEAUTIFUL INSPIRING STORY UNTIL YOU REALIZE THE MY DAUGHTER SPANS FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR GROSS SALARY ON A FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT. STUDIO THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ON SUSTAINABLE. SHE JUST SHE HAS A SECOND JOB AS A FULL TIME JOB INSTRUCTOR SHE JUST INFORMING LAST WEEK THAT SHE TOOK A THIRD JOB WORKING AT PETE'S. AND I THINK IT'S A IT'S A SOCIAL COMMENTARY. THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CHARGED IN ON IT HAVE IDEALS TO TEACH OUR KIDS. ARM SIMPLY CAN'T DO IT SHE WILL ACTUALLY BE MOVING HOME. IN MAY. NOT BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO OR MY WIFE AND I WANTED TO EITHER AS WE'RE HAPPY WITH THE EMPTY NEST. BUT SHE SIMPLY HOUSE TOO SO IT IS IT'S JUST SO DISPIRITING TO SEE SOMEBODY. WHO IS WANTED TO GIVE HER LIFE TO TEACHING AND CHANGE LIVES A STUDENTS? SPECIAL ED TITLE ONE SCHOOLS. AND TO SEE THAT IDEALIZED VISION START TO FADE FROM HER EYES AS SHE REALIZED SHE SIMPLY CANCEL. POOR SELF FINANCIALLY TO DO THIS SO I WANT TO THANK PERSONALLY SOME REMEMBER THURMAN. FOR TAKING LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA IS SOMETHING THAT IS DRASTICALLY NEEDED. AND IS NOT A HUGE FIX THIS LEGISLATION ADDRESSES IT AND DOES SO EFFECTIVELY SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. AND AGAIN I WANT THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMOND FOR HIS HIS LEGISLATION. OTHER WITNESSES. WE ARE DONE AND ALSO DO SURGERY. AGREEING OFFICE OF EVERYTHING FENCE BUT INSIDE BUT JUST TO KNOW IN TWENTY TWELVE THIRTY PERCENT OF HOMES FOR SALE ARE AVAILABLE ON THE AVERAGE TEACHER SALARY. TWENTY SIXTEEN IT WAS DOWN TO SEVENTEEN PERCENT THAT'S NOT INCLUDING PLACES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO IT'S LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. SO THIS BILL HELPS DISTRICTS ACTUALLY BECOME MORE SELF SUFFICIENT BECAUSE THE PRE DEVELOPMENT FUNDS GETS THEM STARTED ON THE PROCESS BECAUSE AS A BROWN'S MENTION. THEIR MISSIONS EDUCATION IT'S NOT DEVELOPMENTS SO THEY NEED TO JUST FIND OUT WHAT THEIR OPTIONS ARE AND THE UNIQUE THING ABOUT YOUR HOUSING ALSO BECAUSE I AM PLEASED THAT IT MEETS A VARIETY OF NEEDS. BY CREATING AT AN APARTMENT SITUATION OR RENTAL REVENUE ACTUALLY CREATES UNDERSHIRT REVENUE SO ONCE THE DISTRICT IS ABLE TO COMES NOT MORE SELF SUFFICIENT. THEY'RE ACTUALLY HELPING THEIR EMPLOYEES BY RECRUITING AND RETAINING YOU KNOW REDUCING TRAFFIC HELPING THEIR TEACHERS STAY IN THE COMMUNITY AND ALSO HELPING THEIR GAIN ACTUAL FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY SO IT IS A LONG TERM. SOLUTION ONCE THEY'RE ABLE TO GET BACK OUT FUNDING AND THEN THIS ALSO ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE ARE GETTING PEOPLE INTO RENTALS. SAVING UP THEY CAN NO LONGER HAVE TO DROP FIFTY PERCENT OF THEIR MONTHLY INCOME ON HOUSING THEY CAN ACTUALLY SAVE UP AND THEN IT GOT A MATCHING DOWN PAYMENT SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY TRANSITION TO PERMANENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. I'LL PAUSE THERE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER BRIAN HOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE PROP. THIS BILL AB TWO SEVEN EIGHT EIGHT IS A SOUND APPROACH TO ADDRESSING. SCHOOL EMPLOYEE AND TEACHER HOUSING CRISIS AS I AS WE AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE THEIR SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL. PLEASE STEP UP.

HOUSING PACKAGE THAT WE PASSED THERE WERE FUNDS THAT COULD BE ACCESSIBLE FOR THIS SORT OF A PURPOSE BUT I ALSO THINK THAT. ARE MOVING FORWARD A A SEPARATE VEHICLE TO SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON THIS.

THERE'S SUCH INCREDIBLE EXPERTISE IN THIS COMMITTEE THE MEMBERS WHO'VE COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND WORK ON HOUSING.

AS THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATION THOUGH IT WITH THE NEED FOR MAYBE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION UNITS WE KNOW THAT CITIES ARE TO BE STRUGGLING. TO JUST KEEP UP WITH THEIR OWN HOUSING POPULATION NEEDS. WE WANT TO FIND A WAY TO COMPLEMENT THAT AND CREATE PARTNERSHIPS I'M ASKING FOR HELP FROM THE COMMITTEE ON THIS IS ASPIRATIONAL ON THAT WHICH CONTINUE TO GROW.

GREAT THANK YOU THERE'S A MOTION AND A SECOND MADAM SECRETARY. QUESTION DO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION. CHIU BY CHIU AYE MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN AYE CHAU. CHOI AYE CHOI AYE GLORIA GLORIA AYE LEE MON. THE MONTH I WOULD. WAIT I. YOUR BILL IS OUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT IN SIGN IN ORDER IS MR INNES ARIANNA. WITH FILE ITEM THREE AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN COLONIES. FOR SO I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE AND JUST THINK. THE CHAIR AND AND THE COMMITTEE ALSO FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND AND OUR OFFICE ON. CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS. AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION TO ASSEMBLE A WORKING GROUP CONSISTING OF VARIOUS. BUILDING HOUSING AND ENGINEERING EXPERTS TO DETERMINE NEW POST EARTHQUAKE BUILDING STANDARDS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ESSENTIAL FACILITIES LIKE HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS CURRENT BUILDING CODE IS NOT IS ONLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT AGAINST LOSS OF LIFE IF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE HITS. THE CODE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT WHETHER OR WHEN A BUILDING WILL BE USABLE AFTER A LARGE SEISMIC EVENT. EVEN NEW BUILDINGS ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT REPAIR COSTS AND DOWNTIME AFTER A MAJOR CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE. PEOPLE WOULD BE DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES AND WE WOULD FACE A SIGNIFICANT DESTRUCTION AND TO BE JOE ECONOMY. THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY STANDARDS SO THAT A BUILDING'S STRUCTURE FINISHES AND SYSTEMS WOULD MAINTAIN THEIR INTEGRITY OR COULD BE RESTORED TO SUPPORT BASIC FUNCTIONS OF THE BUILDINGS. PRE EARTHQUAKE USE WITHIN A MAXIMUM EXCESS PARA ACCEPTABLE TIME. IT REQUIRES THE CBSC TO CONVENE A WORKING GROUP TO PROPOSE THE STANDARDS FOR CONSIDERATION. BY THE CBSC DURING THEIR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TRAIN YOKOTE ADOPTION CYCLE. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN ENTER BUILDINGS AND RESUME NORMAL ACTIVITY SOON AFTER A LARGE EARTHQUAKE INSTEAD OF HAVING BUILDINGS CLOSED FOR MONTHS OR YEARS AT A TIME. I'M JOINED BY STRUCTURAL ENGINEER RYAN CURSED THING CHAIR OF THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS. SEISMOLOGIST DR LUCY JONES OF WITH THE DOCTOR LUCY JONES CENTER FOR SCIENCE AND SOCIETY. YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU ASSUME IN THIS AREA AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES PEAK TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON AN IMPORTANT TOPIC. TO THE SEISMIC SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. I'M RANKERS THING I'M A PRACTICING STRUCTURE ENGINEER HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND I AM HERE TODAY AND SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE STRUCTURES YEARS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SIAKA AS WE CALL OURSELVES. BY THE SEVEN MEN HAS GIVEN YOU A GREAT INTRODUCTION TO THE BASICS OF THE BILL'S LOUDEST ONE TAKE A FEW MINUTES THE HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE. AT THE KEY POINTS THAT WE FIND SO IMPORTANT ABOUT IT. AND HOPEFULLY IS DIESEL ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT STILL HAVE. S. STRUCTURE ENGINEERS WE UNDERSTAND THE CODE INTENT OF LIFE SAFETY. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE PUBLIC DOESN'T HAVE THAT SAME UNDERSTANDING OF THE CODE INTENT AND SO THIS BUILDUP GOES TO SPEAK TO SOME OF THOSE AYE MISCONCEPTIONS. AT FIRST THE BILL REFERS TO A FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY STANDARD IS A NEW IDEA. THIS FUNCTION RECOVERY STANDARD DOES NOT MEAN IMMEDIATE OCCUPANCY NECESSARILY FOR ALL BUILDINGS. IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE'RE GOING TO SIGN EVERY BUILDING TO BE LIKE A HOSPITAL. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A ONE SIZE FITS ALL PRESCRIPTIVE APPROACH TO THE BUILDING CODE. IT'S INSTEAD IT CONSIDERS AN APPROPRIATE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE FOR EVERY BUILDING. BASED ON ITS SPECIFIC USE IT OF A DOCUMENT SEE IT'S A SPECIFIC IMPORTANCE TO BUILD A OF A COMMUNITY TO RECOVER AFTER EVENTS. IT'S NOT JUST PROTECT LIFE SAFETY IS STILL OUR COMMUNITY RECOVER IN A MEANINGFUL TIME FRAME. THIS WILL LIKELY BE SOME SORT OF SLIDING SCALE TO GIVE SOME OPPORTUNITY SOME FLEXIBILITY TO HAVE DIFFERENT BUILDINGS DESIGNED FOR DIFFERENT TIME FRAMES OF RECOVERY. IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A NEW IDEA. UP PARTS ARE ALREADY IN THE CODE IS YOU HEARD WE'VE WE HAVE HOSPITALS AND OTHER BUILDINGS ARE DESIGNED FOR IMMEDIATE OCCUPANCY OR SOME SORT OF FUNCTION RECOVERY BETTER THAN JUST THE BASIC BUILDING. IT'S ALSO BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN STUDIED AND IMPLEMENTED A DIFFERENT LEVELS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES IN ISRAELI BE IMPLEMENTED TODAY IF WE WANTED TO. SECOND DOESN'T CHANGE THE CODE THIS BILL DOESN'T ACTUALLY CHANGE OUR CHO THEY JUST FORCE WORKING GROUP IT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO THIS TOPIC. BUT THIS WORKING GROUP WOULD STUDY THE ISSUE CONSIDER THE CHANGES OF ANY THAT MIGHT NEED IT'S THE BUILDING CODE. THEN MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION AND EACH CD. AS LONG AS THERE IS CONSENSUS WAS IN THAT WORKING GROUP. NOW THESE ENTITIES WITHIN CONSIDERED THESE AMENDMENTS ARE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS APART A NORMAL CHO PROCESS VERY PUBLIC OPEN PROCESS. AND AGAINST A VERY THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TOPIC FOR BUILDING BECAUSE THE CONSIDERING. AND FINALLY IF IF RECOMMENDATIONS ACTUALLY GOT MADE IN AND IMPLEMENTED IN THE CODE. WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT THIS WILL ONLY INCREASE CONSTRUCTION COSTS ON A LIMITED NUMBER BUILDINGS BY WOMEN'S AMOUNT OF PERCENTAGE POINTS. NOT IN THE END IT WILL ACTUALLY SAVE MONEY IN THE END. MANY TIMES OVER BY SAVING IN TERMS OF REDUCING THE LOSSES INTERVIEW DAMAGE AND RECOVERY TIME. THEIR NUMBER PROJECT CASE STUDIES THAT SUPPORT THESE CONCLUSIONS WELLS FOR FEDERER. REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY PRODUCED. SEE OCT SUPPORTS THIS BILL AS IT STARTS AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION ABOUT AMY FOR SOMETHING BETTER THAN LIFE SAFETY IT'S LOOKING AT COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. AND IMPROVING OUR BUILDING CODES. AS IMPORTANT PART OF THAT MOVEMENT WE ENCOURAGE OUR SUPPORT THIS BILL ON HAPPEN ANSWER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AFTER DOCTOR JONES SPEAKS. DR. YOU. I CAN TELL YOU WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT THERE WILL BE A BIGGER. ON THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT. WE'RE NOT STOPPING PLATE TECTONICS. I CAN'T TELL YOU QUINN. BUT WE CAN DO A QUITE GOOD JOB OF TELLING YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THAT INEVITABLE EARTHQUAKE COMES ALONG. WE KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL LIVE. WE KNOW THAT OUR NEW WE HAVE ASKED OUR ENGINEERS. TO GIVE US LIFE SAFE BUILDINGS BUILDINGS THAT DON'T KILL US AND THEY'VE DONE THAT QUICK THAT'S I JUST ONE IN FOUR. MODERN CURRENT CODE BUILDINGS IN THE BAY AREA WILL NOT BE USABLE AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE. AND. THIS MAY SEEM EXTREME BUT IT IS WHAT WE STILL SAW IN NEW ZEALAND CHRISTCHURCH NEW ZEALAND HAS BUILDINGS LIKE CARS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT. UP UNDER THE SAME CODE THE SAME SORT OF APPROACHES. AND THEY HAD THEIR DESIGNED EARTHQUAKE WHAT THE CODE SAYS THEY SHOULD BILL TO IN TWENTY ELEVEN. THE CODES DID WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO NOBODY DIED IN A MODERN BUILDING. BUT ONCE THE DUST SETTLED THEY ENDED UP HAVING TO TEAR DOWN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED BUILDINGS. AND THEIR CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT WAS CLOSED FOR FIVE YEARS. NOT JUST THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE BAD THE NEIGHBORS OF BAD BUILDINGS NOW DON'T GET TO USE THEIR BUILDINGS SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE BILL THE BUILDINGS IN THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT WERE DAMAGED. A HUNDRED PERCENT WERE CLOSED BECAUSE OF THE RISK FROM THE BAD BUILDINGS. WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA. HOW DO WE GET OUR ECONOMY GOING AGAIN? IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS NOW. IMAGINE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN ALL OF THAT DANCE CONSTRUCTION THAT'S BEEN GOING AND ALL OF THOSE NEW CONDOS IN HIGH RISES. DON'T KILL ANYBODY BUT CAN'T BE USED WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A MAJOR HOUSING CRISIS IF WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO BUILD AT THIS LEVEL. THAT SAYS ALL THAT MATTERS IS LIVING THROUGH IT NOT WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS. AND I POINT OUT THAT. THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS NOT A TECHNICAL ISSUE IT'S NOT HOW TO BUILD A BUILDING. IT'S A POLICY ISSUE OF WHAT WE WANT IS THE STANDARD TO BE DO WE WANT DISPOSABLE BUILDINGS. ARE THEY WOULD WANT BUILDINGS WE CAN USE AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE THEIR SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL. HI THERE MY NAME'S HIGHLY TRAINED I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING RESEARCH INSTITUTE. FLORA AND OTHER NONPROFIT MEMBERSHIP SOCIETY DEDICATED TO REDUCING EARTHQUAKE RISK ARE THREE THOUSAND MEMBERS ARE EXPERTS ON IN THE FIELDS OF EARTH SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND POLICY. WITH FOR MORE THAN SEVENTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN DRAWN THESE EXPERTS TOGETHER TO SHARE IDEAS AND TO ADVANCE EARTHQUAKE SAFETY. I'M HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT THE BILL ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR PREPARING CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COMMUNITIES TO BE RESILIENT AND TOOK A QUICKLY FALLING MAJOR EARTHQUAKES IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. OTHER SUPPORTERS. LET ME ASK IF THERE IS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS SILVIO FOR OUR IN BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL. BUT WE'VE BEEN HAVING VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS AND I THINK WE DO BELIEVE THAT ARE REMAINING CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED. MOVING FORWARD ON THE FIRST OF THOSE CONCERNS AND WE REALLY ARE TALKING ABOUT PROCESS. UNDER THE FIRST THOSE CONCERNS IS WHAT WE VIEW AS A RESTRICTING OF THE WORKING GROUPS WERE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT A WORKING GROUP SHOULD BE DEVELOPED. A IT SHOULD BE POPULATED WITH THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST IN THESE VARIOUS FIELDS AND THEY SHOULD GET TOGETHER NATION INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE. BUT THE BILL MAKES A DETERMINATION THAT AFTER THAT WORK IS COMPLETE THE OUTCOME WILL BE MANDATORY BUILDING STANDARDS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT AS WE'VE SEEN THE PAST PRACTICE ON A HOST OF ISSUES THAT THAT WORKING GROUP SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO USE THEIR EXPERTISE TO DEVELOP WHAT EVERTHOSE RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD BE. AND THEY MIGHT BE MANDATORY STANDARDS THEY MIGHT NOT BE THEY MIGHT BE VOLUNTARY THEY MIGHT BE SOMETHING ELSE AND WE DON'T THINK. THAT THE BILL SHOULD JUST MAKE THE PRE DETERMINATION WHAT THE OUTCOME IS. THE SECOND ISSUE REVOLVES AROUND THE AGENCY AND ENSURING THAT THE AGENCY RETAINS FULL AUTHORITY OVER THE PROCESS AND THE PRODUCT. YOU CAN SEE IN THE BILL THAT RIGHT NOW THE WORKING GROUP HAS BEEN GIVEN THE AUTHORITY TO DIRECT THE BUILDING STANDARDS COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT HOUSING COMMITTEE IN A DEVELOPMENT TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH STANDARDS. WE THINK THAT'S UNPRECEDENTED WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW OF. ANY OTHER WORKING GROUP THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN THAT KIND OF AUTHORITY MOST RECENTLY WORKING ON BOTH RECYCLED WATER AND EVEY CHARGING. THE AGENCIES TO GREAT WEIGHT AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME OUT OF THESE EXPERT WORKING GROUPS AND WE DON'T SEE THAT THERE BE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THIS EITHER. BUT THE IN THE DAY IT IS THOSE AGENCIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO PROMULGATE THE STANDARDS AND THEY HAVE A PROCESS THEY HAVE TIME AND WE BELIEVE. THAT RECOMMENDATION SHOULD AND CAN BE MADE TO THEM AND THEN THEY MOVE FORWARD FOR THE ULTIMATE DECISION BUT AGAIN WE BELIEVE THESE PROCESS TYPE ISSUES CAN BE RESOLVED WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS TO DO THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER OPPONENTS TO THE BILL. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SHOT BACK IN THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WE TOO ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND. ECHO THE COMMENTS OF OUR COLLEAGUES TO BE I THINK. GOOD MORNING I MELISSA BARTON WITH A A CALIFORNIA COUNCIL WE ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE CIA AND THEIR POSITION. THANK YOU. MANY OTHER OPPOSITION. LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS. MISTER CHOI. IMPAIRED SHARE. OUR AYE. GREED DOT. A AN ARGUMENT THAT BY DE OPPOSITION INSIDE THE IS SAYS SO. CALIFORNIA BUILDING STANDARDS ARE COMMISSION PROCESS IS A TIME TESTED AND THE WORKING FINE. SIZE SAID THERE SO NOTHING IN. ALL BREAK A ROUTING EIGHT WORKING GROUP OUT VIA EXECUTIVE ORDER NONSENSE SO WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THE EARTHQUAKE THAT THREAT. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT DOCUMENT? FIRST OF ALL IF IF YOU DON'T START A CONVERSATION THERE WON'T BE ANY ADVANCEMENT. SO. AND IN THIS DAY IDEA OF THIS BILL I MEAN JUST. BY THE FACT THAT IT'S A WORKING GROUP. COMING UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS TELLS YOU THAT. WE'RE NOT MANDATING ANYTHING AS A BODY. WE'RE NOT FORCING ANYONE SPECIFIC THING WE'RE JUST SETTING A GOAL OF HOW DO YOU MAKE BUILDINGS NOT BE DISPOSABLE. BECAUSE THAT COULD CREATE A SEVERE. MARKET DISRUPTION. SO. YOU'RE YOU'RE BASICALLY WORKING ON PRE EMPTING THAT SEVERE MARKET DISRUPTION LATER ON BY A VERY SMALL MARGINAL. INVESTMENT UP FRONT. YOU'VE THE BABY DAYS COOLEY I'M SORRY THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THE PRESIDENT COME COMMISSION YOUR YOU CAN WORK WITH THEM AND THEN THEY CAN. MEAT THOUGH WHAT YOU U. S. DESCRIBING RATHER THAN CREATING NEW POOL. BUT. I THINK I MEAN THE BUILDING CODE. PROCESS HAS HAS. GIVEN CALIFORNIA A LOT. BUT IT IT'S A IT IS LEFT UP UNTIL NOW WITH THE ENGINEERS THE DECISION ABOUT WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. AND WHAT THIS IS SAYING IS THAT THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES THERE'S A POLICY ISSUE OF WHAT TO AS A SOCIETY DO WE WANT. AND THEN THERE'S A TECHNICAL DECISION ABOUT HOW DO YOU ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. AND SO THIS IS A PROCESS TO SAY. THE. PROCESS HAS WORKED TO GIVE US LIFE SAFETY BUT IT'S TIME TO LOOK AT SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. THE COUPLE THOUGHTS I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FOR THIS MEASURE. YOU AND I HAVE WORKED ON A NUMBER OF EARTHQUAKE SAFETY MEASURES OVER THE YEARS. I WAS EARLY CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL IN PART BECAUSE I REPRESENT A CITY AS YOU DO. WITH SIGNIFICANT DENSITY AND SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL LOSS OF LIFE. OF MY CITY LIKE YOURS AND MANY OTHERS AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREDIBLE DEVASTATION NINETEEN OH SIX EARTHQUAKE AND FIRE IN SAN FRANCISCO NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE LOMA PRIETA. AND. TO DOCTOR JONES IS POINTS AND I WOULD SAY THIS TO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM IRVINE. WE KNOW WITH GREAT CERTAINTY IT'S NOT A MATTER OF WHETHER AN EARTHQUAKE IS GOING TO HIT IT'S A MATTER OF WHEN. SEVENTY TWO PERCENT CHANCE OF BELIEVE OVER THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS. IN MY CITY WHEN I WAS A LOCAL. MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE INITIALLY LEGISLATIVE A VOLUNTARY SEISMIC STANDARD FOR SOFT STORY BUILDINGS. WHICH WAS ALL GREAT AND FINE EXCEPT NO ONE. REALLY TOOK ADVANTAGE OR OR. TOOK REGARD THE FACT THAT WE HAD THESE VOLUNTARY STANDARDS SO WE IMPLEMENTED MANDATORY STANDARDS WITH ENOUGH TIME FOR ADDRESS ISSUES AND. IT HAS WORKED WELL SO AM I DO THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AFFORD IN PARTICULAR WE KNOW IT'S NOT ABOUT. IMMEDIATE LIFE SAFETY CONCERNS BUT HOW WE RECOVER HOW WE ARE RESILIENT. AS COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK WE CAN JUST LOOK TO. SOME OF THE CITIES AND REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY RECENT FIRES AND MUD SLIDES. TO KNOW THAT IF WE DON'T GET READY FOR THE BIG ONE. IT'LL COST US BILLIONS UPON BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO WITH THAT AND I AM SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ONE JUST CLARIFY TO THE AUTHOR ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR. YES GREAT YES ARE AND WITH ANALYSTS ANY FINAL COMMENTS IS THERE A MOTION TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. AND AND A SECOND. LET ME ASK THE AUTHORITY OF ANY FINAL COMMENTS. YOU YOU ACTUALLY I'LL TAKE YOUR COMMENTS AS THE COURSE BECAUSE THAT WAS DISTINCTLY FELT WELL VERY WELL PUT THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS GIVEN SOME THINGS THAT WERE WORKING ON AND A. HOMELESS CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW IF IF WE THINK WE'RE IN A CRISIS RIGHT NOW WITH HOMELESSNESS. OFFER THE PROTECTIONS NECESSARY FOR FUTURE BUILDINGS WE'RE GONNA BE DEVASTATED BY THE DISPLACEMENT OF HUMAN LIFE. IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT THANK YOU WITH THAT BUT OF SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION TO PASS AMENDED IN RE REFER TO THE COMEDIAN APPROPRIATIONS CHIU AYE CHIU AYE MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN NO CHAU. CHOI. SHOWING NO. GLORIA. GLORIA AYE LIMA. FREMONT I WOULD. WOULD I. THAT MEASURE PASSES. YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU YOU CALLING SOMEONE CALL TWO ITEMS TOGETHER AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE TWO AUTHORS OF. BILL IDEAS ARE QUITE SIMILAR IN A JOINT PRESENTATION IN THIS IS SLIGHTLY UNORTHODOX BUT. NOW FILE ITEM ONE AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY EIGHT BY STEINORTH AS WELL AS FILE ITEM FOR A. B. NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE BY MISTER BONTA LET ME JUST START WITH A COUPLE COMMENTS.  <u><c.green>I WANT TO THANK</c></u> BOTH OF THE AUTHORS FOR FOCUSING ON A NEW IDEA FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP AROUND HOMEOWNERSHIP SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. I KNOW THIS IS A IDEA THAT MISTER STEINORTH HAS BEEN WORKING ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS I THINK THIS IS YOUR THIRD ITERATION OF THIS BILL. AND A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND FINE TUNING THIS OVER TIME I. KNOW MR BONTA INTRODUCED HIS VERSION OF. HOMEOWNERSHIP SAVINGS ACCOUNT THIS YEAR APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD WITH EACH OF YOU SEPARATELY AND. WITH MY STAFF WAS TRYING TO WORK ON SOME CONSISTENT AMENDMENTS ACROSS YOUR TWO BILLS BUT ALSO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE TWO OF YOU WERE. FOUND EACH OTHER AND HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS AND I UNDERSTAND. ARE WILLING TO MERGER PROPOSALS. TODAY SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND. TURN IT OVER TO YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AND STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON AB NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AND ARE MERGED EFFORT I WON I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER STEINORTH FOR. HIS. FANTASTIC WORK OVER THE YEARS TO BUILD THIS IDEA OF HOME OWNERSHIP SAVINGS ACCOUNTS SOMETHING THAT. I THINK REALLY HELP CALIFORNIANS NEED THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN AND SO WE'RE EXCITED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER AS JOINT AUTHORS BEHIND A. B.. NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE I I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE OF THE COMMITTEE. I WERE HAPPY TO ACCEPT ALL OF THEM THANK YOU FOR THOSE I'LL GO OVER SOME OF THE KEY ONES IN A MOMENT. ALSO. SOME OF THE THOUGH WONDERFUL WORK OF A SIMILAR STEINORTH WE'RE GONNA BE INCORPORATING INTO THAT THE BILLS WE GO FOR ITS LET ME JUST GO OVER THOSE REAL QUICKLY THE KEY COMPONENTS SO WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. HOW MAKE A FEW COMMENTS I KNOW SOME OF OUR STEINORTH WILL AS WELL AND THAT WE HAVE? OUR. WITNESSES AS WELL SO I'M AMONG THE MEMBERS THAT WILL BE INCLUDING. HOW? THE HOMEOWNERSHIP SAVINGS ACCOUNT SWALLOW WILL ONLY APPLY TO TAXPAYERS THAT MAKE UP. UP TO HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT OF AVERAGE MEDIAN INCOME. MEDIAN INCOME TO QUALIFY FOR THE HSA. WE'RE GONNA CAP THE AMOUNTS IN THE ACCOUNTS AT TWENTY PERCENT. OF THE MEDIAN HOME VALUE IN THE STATE. AND WE'RE GONNA REMOVE THAT COMPONENT CURRENTLY IN AB NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE INDICATING THAT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE HSA QUALIFY. FOR A TAX DEDUCTION. SO THESE WERE ESSENTIALLY OPERATE. THE WAY FIVE TWENTY NINE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS DO OR ROTH IRA REYES DO WHERE IT'S POST TAX DOLLARS THAT GO IN. AND THEN THERE'S A TAX ADVANTAGE NAM ON THE GROWTH AND AND THE THE CAN ONLY BE USED FOR. PURCHASING OF A HOME FOR FIRST TIME HOME BUYER. SO WHEN WE THINK THAT THE WITH THAT PROPOSED THAT WE HAVE. WE'LL BE ABLE TO HELP CALIFORNIANS ACHIEVE THE DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP BY ALLOWING FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS TO SAY FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT USING THIS NEWLY CREATED TAX ADVANTAGED SAVINGS ACCOUNT. BY NET MANY DEFINITIONS HOMEOWNERSHIP IS THE KEY COMPONENT TO REALIZING THE MIDDLE CLASS DREAM BUT WITH SOARING HOME PRICES. MANY PEOPLE SIMPLY CANNOT REACH THAT GOAL AB NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE GIVES HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS A STEP UP. TO HELP UNLOCK THE DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP IN A NEW OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE. OUT WITHOUT OUR WELL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE FIRST TIME WORTH OUT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS LOSSES AND CLARIFYING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE BILL INCLUDES WHAT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE JUST HAD A COUPLE. THERE ARE NUMBER OF TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THAT WE ASK. THE TWO OF YOU TO TAKE A SENIOR ACCEPTING THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS AND THEN. I KNOW MR STEINER SPILL THERE WAS A PROVISION THAT ALLOW FOR INDIVIDUALS OTHER THAN THE BENEFICIARY TO KICK AND TO THE HOMEOWNER SAVINGS ACCOUNT I'M ASSUMING. YOU STILL WANT THAT TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL TRAVIS CRACKED OKAY AND THAT'S FINE BY GREAT PERSPECTIVE GREAT VERY GOOD MR STEINER THANK YOU WELCOME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ALSO AM VERY HAPPY TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA TODAY IS A JOINT AUTHOR OF EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. THE HOMEOWNERSHIP SAVING ACCOUNT EQUIPS FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS WITH THE TOOLS TO OVERCOME EXTREMES THE EXTREME COSTS OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. AND MAKES HOMEOWNERSHIP REALITY FOR OUR RESIDENTS WHEN ACHIEVABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP IS THE SINGLE MOST POWERFUL TOOL FOR ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND IT'S A SINGLE GREATEST INVESTMENT SOMEONE CAN MAKE IN THEIR LIFETIME. WITH THIS BILL WE WILL ENSURE THAT OUR MILLENNIAL TO MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO PLANT ROOTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT'S REAL FINANCIAL EQUITY AND USE OUR TALENTS TO ADVANCE AND IMPROVE OUR STATE. I I'M VERY ENCOURAGED ABOUT THE. THE MOVEMENT THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL TODAY AND I'M OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE OUTCOME AND I JUST AGAIN WANT TO JUST EXPRESS MYGRATITUDE TO THE CHAIR AND TO THE MEMBERS. AND ALSO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA FOR WORKING SO DILIGENTLY TO COME TOGETHER AND PUT THIS BELT. THANK YOU OTHER A BILL TO YOUR SUPPORTERS. THERE'S A MOTION A SECOND MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON MAKE THIS BRIEF JENNIFER SPECK ON THE CALIFORNIA BUT WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. WEREN'T STRONG SUPPORT OF BOTH MEASURES HAPPY TO SEE THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE TWO BILLS WITH THINK THAT IT'S A FANTASTIC CONCEPT. OF WHAT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT AS AS WE ALL KNOW THE COST OF HOUSING IS PROVING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER THIS OPPORTUNITY WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO FIND A COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. THANK YOU NEXT SPEAKER. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ANTHONY GLASS AND THE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH POLICY WITH THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE. AND WE'RE HERE SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE TO SUPPORT CREATING HOMEOWNERSHIP SAVINGS ACCOUNT FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS. THE GREEN LINING THE STATEWIDE POLICY ORGANIZATION COMMITTED TO RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND WE ENVISION A NATION OR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THRIVE. AND RACE IS NEVER A BARRIER LOTS ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. ON THIS DAY FIFTY YEARS AGO THE FAIR HOUSING ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW WHICH IS EXACTLY ONE WEEK AFTER THE ASSASSINATION DOT KING. DOCTOR KING EXAMPLE I INSPIRED MILLIONS OF. OF US TO COMBAT COMBAT RACISM AND REDLINING. AND THAT LEGACY LIVES ON AS WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR OTHER FOR AGAINST OTHER FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION. THAT BAR PEOPLE OF COLOR FROM HOME HOMEOWNERSHIP ANOTHER VEHICLES OF ECONOMIC MOBILITY. HOWEVER TODAY HOMEOWNERSHIP IS AT ITS ALL TIME LOW. THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT R.. HAS BEEN MARKED BY STAGNANT WAGES RISING COSTS INCREASING BARRIERS TO HOUSING AND HOMEOWNERSHIP. NOWHERE IS THIS CRISIS MORE ACUTE THAN IN OUR STATE. WHERE A MAJORITY OF RESIDENTS ARE TENANTS AND NEARLY A THIRD OF THOSE TEN AND SPEND MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME? OUGHT TO PUT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. IN FACT FIFTY NINE PERCENT OF RENTERS OF COLOR. PAY MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF THEIR INCOMES ON RENT. AND ARE STATE ALSO HAS A THIRD LOS HMEOWNERSHIP RATE IN THE COUNTRY ONLY THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF BLACK FAMILIES AND FORTY TWO PERCENT OF LATINO FAMILIES ON A HOME. COMPETITIVENESS SCENT OF WHITE FAMILIES. IN ORDER TO STABILIZE OUR GROWING OUR ECONOMY. AYE WE NEED TO ALLEVIATE HOUSING CRISIS. AND. INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESPONSIBLE HOMEOWNERSHIP IS ONE WAY TO DO THAT. UP IN THIS. AB SNIDELY SEVENTY NINE WILL HELP QUALIFYING HOUSEHOLDS WHO ARE ON THE CUSP OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. TAKE THAT CRITICAL STEP. IN THIS BILL LOT OF VERSIONS OF THIS BILL HAVE ALREADY PASSED IN BUT BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN SIX STATES. AND WE BELIEVE THAT. CALIFORNIA SHOULD FOLLOW SUIT. WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN EXPAND OUR RESPONSIBLE HOMEOWNERSHIP AND SUPPORT CALIFORNIA FAMILIES STRUGGLING THAT'S NOT ONLY STATE TO THRIVE AND BILL THE CALIFORNIA DREAM FOR YOU. THANK YOU OTHER SUPPORTERS. MORE MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHAD WOULD DISAPPEAR WITH A CALIFORNIA CREDIT NEARLY ONE SUPPORT BOTH BILLS REALLY THANK THE ARE AUTHORS FOR THEIR BIPARTISAN LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. ACTION BEFORE WE PROCEED I JUST WANNA MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR FROM THE AUTHORS WE'RE MOVING FOR MISTER BONTA AS BILL WITH A MAN'S. THAT ESSENTIALLY TAKE THE KEY ELEMENTS FOR MR STEINER SPILL RATS CRACK NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE IT'S A BILL THAT'S MOVING FORWARD RIGHT SO I JUST WANNA CLARIFY NO THERE IS A MOTION TO MOVE FORWARD BOTH BILLS I'LL ASSUME THAT'S A. MOTION BEFORE MISTER BONTA AS BILL WHICH WOULD LEAVE OUR AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY EIGHT MISTER STARTERS BILL THE COMMITTEE. GREAT THANK YOU NEXT BIGGER. GOOD MORNING SAYS A MATTER NOT WITH WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIANS FOR THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE MORNING ASSISTANCE AND ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AS A MILLENNIAL MYSELF PAYMENTS FOR. THANK YOU NICK SPEAKER. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DENKER GOT HELPFULLY CALIFORNIA CITIES THAT WERE SUPPORTED PRIOR VERSIONS OF IT PER SHIP MISTER STEINORTH LEADERSHIP IN THE PAST ON THIS AND LOOK FOR SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU. ANY OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. TO THE OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN PERCENT ACROSS THE CONFERENCE TYPES REFORM ASSOCIATION WE DO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS IN AND REVIEW THEM BEFORE DETERMINE WHAT OUR POSITION IS NOW AND APPRECIATE YOUR BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO. TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE CERTAINLY MISTER STEINORTH AS YOU KNOW IN YEARS PAST. I'D BECOME FREE TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS A GREAT MANY OF OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE AND IT IS ALWAYS I'M OFF TO US THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO PRESERVE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING REDUCE FOR CRITICAL SERVICES ALTHOUGH. OBVIOUSLY TAKEN SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO THIS MASURE TO THAT EFFECT WHICH WE APPRECIATE IT WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH THEIR OFFICES THINK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT BIGGER. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHRISTY BAUM ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS WERE REGISTERED IN OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL. I TOO WOULD LOVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS APPRECIATE THE WORK OF BOTH OTHERS TOGETHER. YOU KNOW AS MISS CORBIN STATED WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. PROTECTING STATE LOCAL BUDGETS HOW WE VIEW TAX POLICY AND THEN ADD A LAYER OF DOES THIS REALLY INCENTIVIZE. THE BEHAVIOR LOOKING FOR JUSTICE AND OPPORTUNITY GIVE TAX DOLLARS AWAY AND SO WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THEM IMMENSE AND HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO MOVE OUR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MR MAIENSCHEIN. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK. BOTH OSCAR AUTHORS RESPOND PRETTY PLEASED TO S. FOR THIS BILL BUT I REALLY WANT TO GIVE SPECIAL RECOGNITION TO MISTER STEINORTH WHO HAS. REALLY PASSIONATE WORK THIS BILL FOR. THREE YEARS NOW. IN AND DIED IN IT SHOWS YOUR YOUR GREAT WORK ON THE SHOWS UNFORTUNATE YOU'LL BE LEAVING THE ASSEMBLY. ARE BUT I THINK YOUR WORK HERE IN A ON THIS ISSUE IN PARTICULAR WILL LIVE ON SO I'VE REALLY WANTED TO RECOGNIZE YOU AND VERY PLEASED TO HAVE THIS BILL. THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS. MISTER GLORIA. THANK YOU SHARE OF SO JUST TO CLARIFY IN OF OF. FOR THAT. THANK YOU FOR COMBINED THESE BILLS AND REVIEWING THEM LAST NIGHT IT MAKES ALL SINCE THE WORLD AND. WE LOVE IT WHEN COMMONSENSE PREDATES THAT I IN THIS IN THE SENATE BUILDING. WITH REGARD TO THE BLENDING OF THE BILLS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD LAST NIGHT WAS THE THRESHOLD OF A AM I THINK I HEARD THE YOU GOING WITH HUNDRED TWENTY. IS ALRIGHT AND AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I REALIZE THAT CAPTURES MORE PEOPLE. BUT AS DID SOME QUICK MATH YOU KNOW IN IN MY DISTRICT THAT'S BASICALLY PEOPLE A FAMILY FOR A MIX NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. HOMES THERE YOU KNOW MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS I MEAN THIS THAT THEY DID NEED TO BE HIRED THE LOWER THRESHOLD ADEQUATE TROUBLE WITH CYPRESS HILL THAT. BEING DONE ON THE WITH REGARD TO. THAT FIREFIGHTERS COMMENTS TO HAVE DATA TO LOOK AT THE ANY THIS TWO POINT ONE IS WHAT DO WE COULDN'T WE CONCEIVABLY. PROJECT FOR PARTICIPATION A PROGRAM LIKE THIS AND OF COURSE WHAT IS THAT MEAN FINANCIALLY FOR THE STATE IS ANNIE CAN DO IS THAT I ADDED SEEKING THE BACKUP MAYBE THAT'S NOT THERE YET AND I REALIZE YOU'RE CREATING SOMETHING SO MAYBE HARD TO. TO SAY SPECIFICALLY AT THIS POINT BUT ANY PROJECTIONS ANYTHING YOU CAN SHARE IN TERMS OF NUMBERS BALLPARK FIGURES. I THINK YEAH I THINK THAT THE CHAIR I HAD DONE SOME ANALYSIS ON THIS ISSUE CAN SHARE THAT ARE ON THE TERMS OF THE COST I'M CERTAINLY WHEN WINTERS. A TAX ADVANTAGED AYE INCENTIVIZING FOR FOR SAVING FOR A HOME THAT WE THINK THAT WILL CHANGE BEHAVIORAL IT WE DON'T HAVE A. STUDY WE CAN SHOW YOU RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD THINK COMMON SENSE DICTATES THAT DOM FOLKS WHO PARTICIPATE DEFLECTED IT WITH. THE FIVE TWENTY NINE COLLEGE SAVINGS PLAN BUT. WE CAN WORK OUT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC YOU MISTER GLORIA GET THAT BACK TO YOU ITEMS THE COST I THINK IT'S IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IT SOME OF THE PRIOR PROPOSALS WERE. IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OR MORE SO SO WE'VE REALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT A AND THE COST OF THIS BILL THAT WAS STRATEGIC I'M ON AND I'M MISTER CHIU MIGHT CHAIRMAN YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL. AND SO ACCORDING TO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THE COST OF THE BILL IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE PROJECTION IS EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS I WILL GIVE MISTER STANDARD CREDIT BECAUSE HIS INITIAL PROPOSALS WERE IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THIS. THING DOES MAKE IT GO DOWN A BIT EASIER. WHAT LEVEL OF THIS IT'S MORE THAT ANNOUNCES I'M? AGAIN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE BUYING INTO NO PUN INTENDED. BUT IT THAT YOU KNOW IT'S SUPPORT AND AND I RECOGNIZE IT'S EXTREMELY HARD FOR FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO SAY FOR THIS IS CRIED ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE. AND STOMACH MAKE IT COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS IN TERMS OF HOMEOWNERSHIP IN THE SECURITY THAT PROVIDES. YAPPING AT SOME LEVEL THERE SOME TURNOVER AND PERHAPS SOME OF REASSESSMENT SEMI GENERATED SOME REVENUE FOR THE STATE. NONE OF THAT'S A PART OF THE ANALYSIS OR NOT BUT. INTERESTED TO LEARN ARE MORE INCLINED TO SEE THIS BIPARTISAN COOPERATION OUT FULLY SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MISTER SHARP IT'S OKAY. OF ASSUMING GLORIA OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WHAT WEEK WE CAN'T HELP BUT OFFICE OF THE PROJECTIONS THE COST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AMONG GO BACK TO OUR RESEARCH IN ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT AND SEE WHAT KIND OF NUMBERS THEY CAN COME UP WITH FOR THE ABILITY TO USE OF THE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE OPPORTUNITY WITHIN THE SPELL. OF I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN GUARANTEE THAT PEOPLE WILL DO IT WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE. THE SORT OF RANGE OF OF INCOME AND LIKELY HAD THAT COULD BE USED BUT I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL MORE DATA IS ALWAYS GOOD AND TRYING AGAIN BE RESPONSIVE THE COMMENTS OF THE FIREFIGHTERS WHICH TYPICALLY YOU KNOW I WOULD. TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU KNOW A SERVER VERSION OF GOVERNMENT REVENUES. YOU. WE PAY FOR ONE WAY THE OTHER RIGHT. BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE MAY BE A MODEST SUBSCRIPTION TO THIS WITH RELATIVELY MODEST OVERALL COSTS. AND IF THAT'S TRUE THEN THEN THAT'S HOW HELPFUL FOR EVERYONE TO KNOW IF SOME DIFFERENT WE ALSO KNOW THAT FOR A VOTE RIGHT. BUT AT FOR TODAY I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL WAS DOING THAT YOU THINK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. UP A FEW COMMENTS RIGHT PERSPECTIVE AND I SHARE THIS WITH THE TWO AUTHORS ON THEIR ORIGINALLY INDIVIDUAL BILLS BUT I'LL JUST MENTION TO THE COMMITTEE. ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I'D HAD ABOUT THIS BILL WASN'T EXACTLY ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THIS BILL BUT THE FACT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT. TAX SUBSIDIES ALREADY TO HOMEOWNERS. THERE WAS A STUDY LAST MONTH ARE THAT SHOW THAT HOMEOWNERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVE SICK BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. MOSTLY FROM MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION AND PROPERTY TAX. BREAKS WHERE RENTERS RECEIVE ONE FIFTEENTH THAT SOME OTHER WORDS RENDERS WHO MAKE UP A LITTLE ABOUT A LITTLE LESS THAN HALF THE STATE. RECEIVE LITERALLY. BUT TO HER FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR MULTIPLY THAT BY FIFTEEN THAT'S WHAT HOMEOWNERS RECEIVE SO FOR ME. IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT DISCUSSION AN ADDITIONAL. SET OF OF TAX SUBSIDIES I CERTAINLY LOOK ON WITH THE SIGNIFICANT SCRUTINY IF A REP TO ME. BUT I THINK THAT WHAT MR STEINORTH AND WHAT MR BONTA ARE PROPOSING ARE MUCH BETTER TAILORED. TOWARD. THE NEEDS OF FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS AND I WOULD IF IT WERE UP TO ME I WOULD LOVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SHIFT. THE TAX SUBSIDY FROM WHAT IS A HIGHLY REGRESSIVE MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION AND FOR THAT MATTER I THINK PROPERTY TAX. A EXCLUSIONS AS WELL AND SHIFTED TO TO THIS BUT. GIVEN THAT. THE AUTHORS HAVE PARED DOWN THE TAX IMPACT OF THIS BILL. I THINK IT IS WORTHY OF OUR SUPPORT. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION. I ALSO WANNA RESPOND MISTER GLORIA AROUND THE THRESHOLD INITIALLY OUR STAFF HAD SUGGESTED AN EIGHTY PERCENT AND MY THRESHOLD. BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE CONSISTENT ACROSS TO REFER PROPOSALS BUT I THINK GIVEN THAT WE'VE MERGED INTO ONE THAT IS LESS EXPENSIVE. I DO AGREE THAT ARE REYES AND IT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT I AM I WILL HELP US CAPTURE MORE FOLKS THAT ARE CHALLENGING OWNING A HOME SO WITHOUT. A A A A APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S DONE. BY THE MEMBERS AND. I THINK WE'VE HAD A MOTION TO MOVE FOR MR BOUGHT HIS BILL AS AMENDED WITH MR STEINER SPILL. BONTA STEINORTH BILL AND A LESSER NEAR FINAL COMMENTS BACK TO THE AUTHORS. I JUST WANNA THE SECOND THAT THE COMMENTS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN. REGARDING THAT TREMENDOUS WORK THAT SUMMER STEINORTH HAS DONE OVER THE YEARS AND PROUD TO BE WORKING WITH HIM AND TEAMING UP AND ON A BI PARTISAN EFFORT THAT WE HOPE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL SO. I THINK YOU SOME MEMBER STEINORTH THANK YOU TO MISTER CHAIR AND AND COLLEAGUES AND AND STAFF RESPECTFULLY ASK DRIVE OUT. GREAT MADAM SECRETARY. MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFERRED TO THE COMEDIAN DRIVING AND FIXATION. CHU HI CHIU AYE MAIENSCHEIN AYE MAIENSCHEIN AYE CHAU. CHAU AYE CHOI AYE AYE CHOI I GLORIA. GLORIA AYE COOLEY MON.

IT CAME FROM THE TRAGEDY OF SAN JOSE WOULD NO DOUBT AND MANY A LOT OF PEOPLE. A GUY. LOST THEIR LIVES IN A MOBILE HOME FIRE. BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUILDING AND ALSO TO LAY ALL OF THE MOBILE HOME PARK. IN RECENTLY AND SAN JOSE OF A FAMILY ALL THREE GOT KILLED. AND TWO OF THEM WERE JUST YOUNG CHILDREN'S. SO DISPELLED IS TRYING TO RE IMPROVE AND I'M SURE THEY WILL IMPROVE TO FIRE SAFETY FOR RESIDENTS. POTENTIAL SAVING LIVES AND WAS ME TODAY I HAVE TO CELLS A FIRE CHIEF ROBERSON PAEAN. AND NICHOLAS CHáVEZ ON BEHALF OF THE GOLDEN STATE MANUFACTURING HOME OWNERS LEE. WHO SAT? ROBERT. THANK U.. ON AUGUST FIFTEENTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN AT TWELVE THIRTY THREE PM SAN JOSE FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO REPORTED STRUCTURE FIRE INVOLVING A MOBILE HOME AND ONE OF OUR NORTH SAN IS A MOBILE HOME PARKS. UPON ARRIVAL FIRE CREWS FOUND A FULLY ENGULFED MOBILE HOME THAT WAS EXTENDING. TWO MOBILE HOMES ON EITHER SIDE. SEARCH FOR OCCUPANTS WAS PERFORMED. ON THE ADJACENT MOBILE HOMES HOWEVER FIRE CONDITIONS PREVENTED. ENTRY INTO THE INVOLVED UNIT. MITIGATION EFFORTS PREVENTED FURTHER SPREAD AND THE MAIN FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED. AS THE SMOKE CLEARED FROM THE HEAVILY DAMAGED. STRUCTURE. WITNESS WITNESS STATEMENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS STATEMENTS LED DO A CAREFUL SEARCH FOR VICTIMS. WITHIN A FEW HOURS IT WAS CLEAR THAT AN ADULT MALE EIGHT SIXTY FOUR. AND TWO JUVENILES AGES NINE AND TEN HAD PERISHED. I WANT TO BEGIN. BY STATING THAT I AM CERTAIN THAT SMOKE DETECTORS SAVE LIVES. THE TRAGIC OUTCOME OF AUGUST FIFTEENTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN. IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE REALITY OF UNDETECTED FIRES IN OCCUPIED BUILDINGS. SURVIVABILITY IN AN ENCLOSED ENVIRONMENT WHERE BREATHABLE AIR IS CONSUMED AND REPLACED BY CARBON MONOXIDE. IS REDUCED IN SECONDS. TOO OFTEN. THE OUTCOME IS DETERMINED EVEN BEFORE THE BELL STRIKES AT THE FIREHOUSE. ONCE THE BELL STRIKES TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE BUT IN THE CASE OF MOBILE HOME PARKS WE HAVE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES. NARROW ROADWAYS. SINGLE ENTRY POINTS. SPEED BUMPS LIMITED WATER SUPPLY. THESE ALL CHALLENGE OUR RESPONSE TIMES. ADDITIONALLY LIGHTWEIGHT BUILDING MATERIALS PROVIDE LITTLE FIRE RESISTANCE. AND SMALL SPACES BECOME SMOKE FILLED AND REACH HIGH TEMPERATURES VERY QUICKLY. I BELIEVE THAT OUR BEST CHANCE AT SAVING LIVES FROM FIRE PARTICULARLY IN THE MOBILE HOME ENVIRONMENT IS THROUGH THE EARLY DETECTION PROVIDED BY SMOKE DETECTORS. AND FURTHER. STRENGTHENING SMOKE DETECTOR REQUIREMENTS IN MOBILE HOMES WERE REDUCE OUTCOMES LIKE THOSE EXPERIENCED IN SAN JOSE. ON AUGUST FIFTEENTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN. TEAR MEMBERS. NICHOLAS CHAVEZ ON BEHALF THE GOLDEN STATE MANUFACTURED HOMEOWNERS LEAGUE. REPRESENTING SENIORS FOR ENTRANCE IMMIGRANTS AND OTHER LOW AND MODERATE. AND FIXED HIM INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO LIVE IN MOBILE HOME PARKS UPSTATE IN SUPPORT. OF AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT. YOU WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO FOR OFFERING THIS BILL WHICH PROMOTES FIRE SAFETY MOBILE HOME PARKS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS BILL REQUIRE ALL MANUFACTURED HOMES TO HAVE THE MOST UP TO DATE SMOKE ALARMS INSTALLED AT THE POINT OF MOBILE HIMSELF. PARK OWNERS TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS ASSESSABLE RESIDENTS UPON THE QUEST OF RESIDENTS IN THE SPOKEN LANGUAGE BY THE RESIDENT UPON REQUEST. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL SETS UP A FEE FOR SERVICE IN PUNITIVE FREE. OPPORTUNITY FOR RESIDENTS SEEK TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. RESPECT LAST FIAT VOTES. THANK YOU ANY OTHER SUPPORTERS. LET'S NOW GO TO THE OPPOSITION. POSSIBLE TO FOR FOR OUR OPPONENTS TO SIT AT THE AT THE TABLE. THE GREAT. JENNIFER SECOND HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS I'M WE WERE GONNA EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL BUT WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US TO ALLEVIATE OUR CONCERNS. AMENDMENT SO THAT ARE NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WILL SATISFY. OF OUR ISSUES WITH THE BILL AND WE ARE NOW NEUTRAL. THANK YOU. MEMBERS COMMITTEE. MY NAME'S KATHERINE BOARD WITH THE WESTERN MANUFACTURED HOUSING COMMUNITIES ASSOCIATION AND NAM. YOU DON'T VERY SORRY ABOUT THAT TRAGIC EVENT IN IN SAN JOSE. I THINK THERE WERE A LOT OF OTHER FACTORS THAT. UNFORTUNATELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE. A FIRE IN THAT PARTICULAR MOBILE HOME. I WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT ARE. IN THE IN THE BILL. THEY'RE MORE FACTUAL AND POLICY RELATED. SECTION NUMBER ONES BEEN TAKEN CARE OF AND AND WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THE. AMENDMENTS THERE. SECTION TO HAS TO DO WITH THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY. MOBILE HOME PARKS TO CREATE. DOT HAS BEEN ON THE STATUTE FOR A LONG TIME BUT IN BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE. I'M WE AGREED WITH A SENATOR PATEA TO. MAKE SURE THAT THESE PLANS WERE AVAILABLE READILY THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. ON THE INTENT THERE AND IT STATED IN SP TWENTY THREE IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THE OWNER. OR OPERATOR MOBILE HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITY COMMUNICATE TO RESIDENTS ESSENTIALLY VACUOUS XIN ROOTS AND BASIC EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION. IN A MANNER APPROPRIATE TO THE COMMUNITY IT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. THAT AN OWNER OR OPERATOR BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PHYSICALLY EVACUATING RESIDENTS FROM THEIR HOMES DURING EMERGENCY. IT'S FOR THE AND FURTHER THE INTENT THAT THE RESIDENTS TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEMSELVES DURING AN EMERGENCY. THESE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS ARE ARE RATHER LARGE. HERE'S ONE FROM RANCHO CALISTOGA HERE'S ANOTHER ONE FROM OUT TO LOOK ANNA. HERE'S THE ONE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF AMER NAM OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES PUTS TOGETHER. AND. OUR MOBILE HOME PARKS USES A TEMPLATE TO. CREATE THESE TYPE OF PLANS. ALL THESE PLANS HAVE TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR THEIR APPROVAL FOR OUR. FOR OUR OUR PERMIT TO OPERATE. IF. WE'RE REQUIRED TO DO ADDITIONAL PLANS IN OTHER LANGUAGES WHICH IS WHICH IS A GREAT CALL I MEAN I WHO WOULD NOT WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. EVERYTHING IN ANY LANGUAGE THAT PEOPLE NEED TO. RETAIN ESPECIALLY EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS STUFF. BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT CAPABILITY. AND WE ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THESE PLANTS TO THE DEPARTMENT THERE ARE FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR MOBILE HOME PARKS IN THE STATE. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE FIVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND EVERY SINGLE PARK. THEY'RE GONNA BE TO. TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PLANS SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR APPROVAL AND LOOKING AND READING ALL THE LINGUISTICS AND DIFFERENT DIALECTS AND DIFFERENT ISSUES WITH REGARD TO THOSE PLANS. I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S EITHER BETTER FOR. YES TO CREATE SOME. GENERIC EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS IN THOSE FIVE LANGUAGES OR. IN A LOT OF THESE PLANS WE'D DIRECT RESIDENTS TO GO TO CERTAIN WEBSITES SO ON THE FEMALE WEBSITE A READY DOT GOV. THEY HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT BROCHURES EMERGENCY SUPPLY LESS IN ALL SORTS OF LANGUAGES THAT ARE FREE ON THEIR WEBSITE SO PEOPLE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. FREE SERVICES BY THE GOVERNMENT SINCE THEY HAVE THE MORE MORE MONEYS AND ABILITIES TO TRANSLATE. GET THOSE DIALECTS RIGHT GET THE INFORMATION RIGHT. YOU KNOW THE MAPS THAT WE PROVIDE FOR EVACUATION ARE. PRETTY UNDERSTANDABLE IN ANY LANGUAGE IF YOU GO TO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. YOU KNOW YOU OR THE BACK OF THE DOOR YOU'VE GOT YOUR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. IN YOU KNOW EVACUATION EXIT AND IT'S PRETTY. EXPLANATORY WITH ARROWS AND GET NOW. ON THE LAST WEEK THE THE LAST PART OF THE BILL HAS TO DO WITH. THE THE BILL CODIFIES A REGULATION. AND THE REGULATION IS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CAN COME OUT AND INSPECT A PERSON'S HOME OR MOBILE HOME PARK. FOR A FOR A SERVICE FEE WHICH IS CURRENTLY A HUNDRED NINETY SIX DOLLARS AN HOUR. IT'S DONE ON A TIME AND MOTION STUDY THAT WAS DONE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO SO EVEN THEN. WHAT THEY'RE CHARGING IS NOT? APPROPRIATE FOR TODAY'S LEVEL OF FUN OF PERSONNEL SO THE MAIN REASON WHY THOSE INSPECTIONS DON'T HAPPEN ON A REQUEST BASIS. IS THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH INSPECTORS THERE ARE FIFTY THREE FUNDED INSPECTORS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES SO THAT'S FIVE LESS THAN COUNTIES WILL THEIR SEVEN VACANCIES AMONG THE FIFTY THREE. SO IT AND THEN PUT ON TOP OF THAT. ONLY FIVE PERCENT OF MOBILE HOME PARKS ARE BEING INSPECTED CURRENTLY. THAT THERE IS A FEE THAT CREATES THESE INSPECTORS IT'S A FOUR DOLLAR FEE. WHEN THE MOBILE HOME PARKS ACT SHE'LL BE EXCLUSIVELY USED FOR INSPECTION OF MOBILE HOME PARKS AND MOBILE HOMES TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH THE MOBILE HOME PARKS ACT. SO. WE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ANY MONEY THERE FOR INSPECTORS TO DO STE THINGS OUTSIDE OF THE MOBILE HOME PARK INSPECTION. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE ASKING THESE INSPECTORS TO COME IN. AND NOT SITE. HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS AND NOTS ON BUT IN THE ANALYSIS SAYS. THE VIOLATION OF THE MPA IS FOUND IN THE COURSE OF INSPECTION AGE CITY CANNOT IMPOSE A PENALTY. SO IF IN FACT. AT AGE CITY INSPECTOR CAME INTO SOMEBODY'S HOME FOUND MAYBE A PROPANE BARBECUE IN THERE. AND SAID HEY THIS IS REALLY YOU NOTICES A REALLY BAD CASE SOME AND USE TO GET THAT BARBECUE OUT WE'RE GONNA CITE YOU FOR IT. THE THEY CAN'T DO THAT ACCORDING TO THE SPILL SO IT NOW YOU'RE PUTTING INSPECTORS INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO TURN A BLIND EYE TO. BAD HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. MS A MONTH THINK YOU I THINK YOU HAVE FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. REGRETTABLY THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT AND SO INTIMATE WITH. IN TERMS OF EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS AND I TOO HAVE BEEN EXPLORING AYE. WHAT EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS MEAN TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS ON A BROADER LEVEL AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THIS COMMUNICATION IS IN LANGUAGES THAT ARE UNDERSTOOD? IT WAS A REAL ISSUE IN OUR DISTRICT AND WE ARE DEFINITELY EXPLORING HOW COUNTIES AND MUNICIPALITIES CAN BE INVOLVED. AND I UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT EASY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AND WE NEED TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE BEST METHOD IS WHO DOES A HOW WE DO IT HOW FAST HE GETS OUT. WHAT IS THE MODE OF COMMUNICATION? BUT I DO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THIS CONVERSATION AND THIS BILL MOVING BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE THIS CONVERSATION REGRETTABLY WE WILL BE IN SPACES WHERE IT CAN BE MORE CHALLENGING SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL HAPPEN BUT I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND JUST. REITERATE HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS I'M NOT JUST TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THAT PERSON WHO MIGHT BE IMPACTED BUT ALL OF THOSE IN THE AREA IN TERMS OF EVACUATION SO THINK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ERA CAN I RESPOND OUR TRAVEL YOU WILL KEEP THIS COMPETITION GOING I NOTE IT IS. IT VERY CHALLENGING OF TO TRANSLATE ALL THOSE. HIM EMERGE EMERGENCY YOU'VE ACTUALLY EVACUATION PLAN. BUT I WANT YOU TO FOCUS ON THIS FIRE A AS YOU BACK WHO XIN PLAN. SO YOU DON'T WE LOOK FOR CAN HELP A A A PICTURE A MAP. AND THAT WE REQUIRED THE. THE DAYS RESIDENT TO POSTED ON A BACK UP THE DOORS. AND OF I THINK WILL BE A VERY. LOCAL SOLUTION FOR THE FIRST STOP BUT I JUST WANT. TO SAY THAT PUBLICLY I WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH LOUIS YOU. AND ANY OPPOSITION TO MAKE IT. SOME POLL. NOT NOT THAT COSTLY. AND BE ABLE TO SAVE LIVES. THERE YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT. MR MAGI. I THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UMPIRE AND PLEASE HEAR THE AUTHORS SAY THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK DEPARTMENTS AMID A SUPPORT THIS TODAY BECAUSE I I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOAL. OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AYE BUT. I THINK THE OPPOSITION RAY SEVERAL. VERY PERTINENT POINTS. THE LACK OF INSPECTORS MEAN TO. IT IS SIGNIFICANT. TO JUST. CREATE SOMETHING THAT HAS NO THAT IS GONNA OF NO PRACTICAL EFFECT BECAUSE IT CAN'T BE ENFORCED. IS A WASTE OF EVERYBODY'S TIME AND I DON'T THINK IT'S THE GOALS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING. WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE I THINK WHAT EVERYBODY ON THIS THIS BODY STRATEGY WHICH IS NOT HAVE THESE TRACK? I THOUGHT THE IDEA OF A WEBSITE YOU SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES MINUTES FOR SEPARATE BUT TODAY BY THINGS PRETTY GOOD IDEA I MEAN THERE'S SOME THINGS I THINK THAT. THAT COULD BE DONE THAT WOULD ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL BUT IT WOULD STILL BE LESS BURDENSOME AND AND WOULD PROBABLY LONG TERM BE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE SO. I'D I'M PLEASED THE AYE AYE WILL SPUR DAY BECAUSE OF YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES BUT. IN PARTICULAR ON THOSE INSPECTORS. THAT I THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED AND YOU KNOW IF THERE'S SOME FEE GOING TO PAY THESE INSPECTORS AND THEN THERE'S NO INSPECTORS. AND IT BEGS THE QUESTION AS TO WHERE IS THIS BE GOING. UP AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE TRACKED DOWN AS WELL TO SELL. MISTER GLORIA. JACOBS CHANGES TO BELABOR THE POINT I I FOUND AND I THINK IS ON POINT. THANK YOU. MISTER CHIU FOR FOR AGREEING TO CONTINUE TO WORK. WAY IF IT IS BORING I END UP HER CLIENTS TO MAKE SURE THE SEXISM IT'S PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTABLE AND SO THAT'S THE PRICE OF THE BUDGET PROCESS IS WELL MAKING SURE THOSE POSITIONS% ARE FILLED. IN THE WORK CAN ACTUALLY BE DONE THE BAD ACTORS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND THE GOOD FOLKS WE WE SHARED OUR GOAL OF ENSURING THAT. OUR MOBILE HOME PARKS ARE ARE SAFE AND THAT RESIDENTS ARE PREPARED IN CASE OF THE WORST EMERGENCY. A AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'RE DOING TO ENSURE THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS GIVEN THE TRAGEDY THAT HAPPENED IN YOUR DISTRICT. IS NOT REPEATED EVEN YOUR DISTRICT ARE ANYWHERE AROUND THE STATE. I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR WORK WITH OUR STAFF ON AMENDMENTS AND AGREED TO THE AMENDMENTS AND I WILL REITERATE I THINK WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM OUR COMMITTEE WHICH HAS. I THINK THAT THE OPPOSITION IS BROUGHT UP SOME ISSUES ARE THAT WILL HELP IMPROVE THE BILL TO MAKE IT MORE WORKABLE FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT AND. THAT IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND TO BE THE. PERSPECTIVE OF THE OPPOSITION SO I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH THEM AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WANT TO SEE A BILL THAT IS WORKABLE AND THAT ADDRESSES THE NEED AND. ARE CERTAINLY IS SOMEONE WHO IS AUTHORED LANGUAGE ACCESS BILLS BEFORE I SHARE YOUR PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT RESIDENTS RECEIVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. IN THE LANGUAGE LANGUAGES THAT. THAT THEY UNDERSTAND. BUT THAT WE DON'T CREATE UNDUE BURDEN AROUND THAT SO. IN ADDITION TO STAFFING ISSUES. I DO KNOW AND BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES SO WITH THAT. OF WITH THE AMENDMENT SO I HAVE A AYE REKO THAT WE MOVE THIS BILL FOR IS OUR MOTION WITH IT FOR. AND SIR SECOND. SECOND OF. SHE WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE PROTECT YOUR BERMAN SHOWN AGAIN SAYING SAWYER. THAT YOUR COMEDIAN AND HIS CHAIR FOR YOUR ARE IMPERFECT AND AND YOU AGAIN YOU HAVE MY WORD I WILL WORK CLOSELY OPPOSITION TO MAKE IT. PARTICLE AND DOABLE AND TO SAY FLAG THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ASK FOR YOUR RIGHTS. THANK YOU. MADAM SECRETARY. MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED INJURY DIVERSITY COMEDIAN APPROPRIATIONS CHIU AYE CHIU AYE MAIENSCHEIN AYE MAIENSCHEIN AYE CHAU. SHALL I CHOI. CHILE NO GLORIA. GLORIA AYE LEE MONTH THE MONTH I WOULD. GOOD I. YOUR BILL IS OUT. YOU VERY MUCH CHECK HERE AND WITHOUT IN ASKING MISTER GORE'S PREPARED TO. MR COLOR FILE ITEM FIVE AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY TWO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND GOOD MORNING MEMBERS AYE I WILL WANT TO BEGIN THIS MORNING BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS OF FOR A. B. TWENTY THREE SEVENTY TWO. I'D DAHLE APPRECIATION TO THE STAFF. WEBER RUNNING THEME THIS MORNING OBVIOUSLY OF THOSE A SURPLUS OF TO YOUR TEAM. IS CHAIRMAN OF WORKING WITH MY OFFICE I TO MAKE AT THE COST HOUSING ACT EVEN BETTER. AS YOU AND I EVERY COMMITTEE MEMBER AND REALLY EVERYONE IN THIS BUILDING KNOWS A WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A SIGNIFICANT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IN THE STATE'S PRODUCTION OF HOUSING. A CONTINUES TO FAIL TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF CALIFORNIANS. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY TWO INCENTIVIZE THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE WORKFORCE AND LOW INCOME HOUSING ALONG TRANSIT PRIORITY QUARTERS. NOW THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A STATEWIDE OPT IN PROGRAM THAT AMENDS DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS TO ALLOW FOR THE USE OF FLOOR AREA RATIO OR FAR. BASED CALCULATION SYSTEM FOR THE CREATION OF NEW RESIDENTIAL UNITS NOW I THINK ALMOST ALL YOU CERTAIN LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO YOU MAY KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS BUT FOR THOSE WHO NOW. A BASICALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF MORE SMALLER UNITS WILL BE BUILT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ALLOWED UNDER CURRENT RULES. TWENTY PERCENT OF THESE UNITS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE AT OR BELOW FIFTY IT FIFTY PERCENT AREA MEDIAN INCOME OR A MI. AND REMAIN AT THAT AFFORDABILITY LEVEL FOR UP TO FIFTY FIVE YEARS SIMILAR TO THE DENSITY BONUS LAW THAT IS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS. ADDITIONALLY THIS. THE AMENDMENTS ADD AFFORDABLE HOUSING REPLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS A TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE EXISTING WORKFORCE HOUSING. THE BILL ALSO MAINTAINS A DEVELOPER'S REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR CONCESSIONS AND INCENTIVES THAT ARE GRANTED UNDER THE DEAD SEA BONUS LAW HOWEVER THE HEIGHT OF THE PROJECT WILL STILL BE REGULATED BY UNDERMINE BASE ZONING. ACOSTA HOUSING ACT DOES NOT USE A PUBLICLY FUNDED DOLLARS TO SUBSIDIZE THE FAA ARE BASED PROGRAM ACTUALLY CREATE A MARKET INCENTIVE AT THE CREATION OF THESE LOW INCOME UNITS. ME THAT WE'RE NOT UTILIZING ARE SCARCE. SUBSIDY DOLLARS OF FOR THESE PROJECTS THOSE CAN CONTINUE FOR TO OTHER MORE TRADITIONAL PROJECTS ON THE MARKET RATE HOUSING HELPS TO SUPPORT THE LOW INCOME HOUSING I IN THIS PROPOSAL. SO AS THE BILL MOVES TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE I WILL ADD A FORMULA THAT WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON HOW TO USE THIS FLOOR AREA CHICAGO NATION SYSTEM OF FOR CLARITY SAKE. AB TWENTY THREE SEMI TO ADDS ANOTHER TOOL IN THE CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING PRODUCTION TOOL BOX WE WILL NEED AT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION NEW HOMES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THIS BILL WILL HELP MAKE IT DAY IN THAT VERY LARGE NUMBER WITH ME TODAY I HAVE TO IT OF WITNESSES OF FIRST MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO THAT SAID YOU SEE COUNCIL MEMBER AND I SHOULD SAY TO CHECK NEW CHAIR OF THE METROPOLITAN TRANSIT SYSTEM. OF THIS IS BILL IS VERY MUCH THE CONVERGENCE OF HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION A DOT COMS MEMBER GEORGIA GOMEZ WHO ORIGINATED OR CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA. AS WAS MORE TOP WAS REPRESENTING THE BILL SPONSORED WHICH THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS WHERE TOP ON BEHALF OF AMERICA BEEN FAULKNER AND THE ENTIRE CITY. CITY COUNCIL OF SAN DIEGO AS MENTIONED WE ARE THE SPONSORS TODAY AND WITH ME IS COUNCIL MEMBER GOMEZ OF FROM THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. THINK YOU AND I THINK YOU FOR CONSIDERING AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY TWO LA THE CASA ACT TODAY. I WOULD LIKE BY FIRST LIKE TO THINK I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER TODD GLORIA FOR WORKING WITH ME AND MY STAFF TO MAKING THIS BILL REALITY. IN SAN DIEGO WHERE I REPRESENT COUNCIL DISTRICT NINE WE ARE STRUGGLING TO BUILD SUFFICIENT HOUSE SEEM TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR RESIDENTS. BUT AS MANY OF YOU CAN ATTEST THIS IS ALSO THE CASE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE BRINGING THAT FORWARD TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE WITHIN OPTIM PROGRAM FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE NEED NEW TOOLS AND INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO SOLVE OUR LACK OF HOUSING. AND IN PARTICULAR AWAY TO INCREASE OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IF WE WANT TO SEEK MORE AFFORDABLE AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE BUILDING DENSER MORE. A COMPACT RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS NEAR TRANSIT. THE CASA ADD DOES JUST THAT BY ALLOWING DEAL DEVELOPERS THE FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE HOW MANY UNITS THEY CAN BUILD. RATHER THAN CAP INTENSITY THROUGH OUR TRADITIONAL MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS OF DWELLING UNITS PER ACRE. WHERE TRADITIONALLY A LOT WOULD BE RESTRICTED TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS PER ACRE? THIS WILL ALLOW MULTI FAMILY HOUSING SOUNDS TO SET A FLOOR AREA RATIO BONUS LEAVING IT UP TO THE DEVELOPERS TO REALLY MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF UNITS ON SITE. BUT CASA ACT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REALIZE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HOUSING UNITS. IN THE APPROPRIATE STONE'S ALONG TRANSIT QUARTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. PARTICULARLY ASK IF THERE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. YEAH THE MARINO I AM OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL. WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE THE BILL BROUGHT INTO REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GRANT THE FAR BONUS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DENSITY BONUS. AS WELL AS AS THE CALCULATIONS FOR THE FART WHAT THE FAR BONUS LOOKS LIKE GOES INTO THE BALLOT SURE THAT THAT IS. COMMENSURATE WITH WHAT AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS ARE. AREN'T ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU NICK SPEAKER. ASSISTANCE AND ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. SHAUN TO PICKING THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. KYLE JOINS US HERE OF CALIFORNIA WITH A SUPPORTING CONCEPT I'M NOT REGULARLY ARE WE HOSPITAL FOR TO SAY HOW THIS BILL GETS WORKED UP OVER SUPPORT THE GULF THANK YOU. YOU CHAIR MEMBERS PACMAN WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES RIPPED FROM THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY APARTMENT ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. I'M BRIAN BECAUSE OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION WE AND OUR COLLEAGUES AT WESTERN CENTER BEEN LOOKING AT THIS BILL AND TALKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS. WE THINK IT'S HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ITS INTERACTION WITH AND SEE BONUS ON MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. UNDERMINING THE EXISTING BALANCE THERE WHILE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THE THE AUTHORS OBJECTIVE SO WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON. IT WITH THE AUTHOR WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION YET BUT WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET THERE THANKS. IT'S BEEN A MOTION WITH THE BILL'S A SECOND. ANY FOR THEIR SUPPORT IS ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS MR MAIENSCHEIN. WELL THANK YOU IT'S A GREAT DAY WHEN I CAN SCORE A CITY SANDIEGO BELL SERVICES STARTING MY DAY OFF WELTER INTO. YOU HAVE A GENIUS BILL LIKE THIS COMING FROM A GREAT CITY SO. I'M I'M I'M VERY HAPPY TO DO SO I A COUPLE BRIEF COMMENTS AT WHAT MISS GOMEZ AT AS WELL. I KNOW YOU'RE ANXIOUSLY WAITING TO GET BACK TO SAN DIEGO AS BOTH TODD AND I ARE AS WELL TO SOME. BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT MISSED Y. THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR GREAT WORK ON THIS OF ALL YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU KNOW THE OPT IN PROVISION I THINK IS SIGNIFICANT YOU AND I ARE GOING TO BE GOOD EXAMPLES OF THAT WITH THE DEBT THE DISTRICTS WE REPRESENTED WHEN WE ARE ON THE CITY. IF YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR DISTRICT HAS MANY MORE TRANSIT FOR EXAMPLE MANY MORE TRANSIT OPTIONS. THAN WE DO I TO GET FROM IN A RANCH FOR OUR SCRIPTS RANCH TO HELP CRAFT STORE EVEN WORSE STEP POINT LOMA OUR SUMMER THERE IS REALLY. IN TERMS OF TRANSIT CHOICE IT IS REALLY AN IMPOSSIBILITY ALMOST ARM AND AND AND. AS SUCH IS NOT UTILIZED BECAUSE TO GET THERE IS A YOU KNOW TWO HOUR BUS RIDE WITH FOR TRANSFERS AND SO AS A AS A RESULT NO ONE DOES IT. SO I THINK HAVING THAT OPT IN. AT UPTON IS VERY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE AS THESE REGIONS HAVE DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT NEEDS AYE AND DIFFERENT ABILITIES TO DO THIS A AND M. IS COMES TO I THINK YOU HAVE SOME AN HOUR I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT PERSON BETWEEN HIM SQUARE BUT YOU HAVE SOME. THE POLICEMAN BETTER TRANSIT OP OPTIONS BUT SOME PROBLEM MORE DIFFICULT HOUSING OPTIONS SO I THINK THIS SORT OF ADDRESSES THAT. THAT BALANCE VERY VERY WELL. AND I THINK IT'S A UNIQUE APPROACH TO TRY TO GET OUT ACT TO TRY TO GET A PROBLEM OF HOW TO INCREASE HOUSING STOCK BUT HAD WE DO SO IN A WAY. THAT DOESN'T TRAP PEOPLE. IN A SITUATION THAT WOULD BE UNSUSTAINABLE BOTH IN TERMS OF HOW THEY DEAL WITH EMPLOYMENT BUT ALSO HOW TO DEAL WITH YOU KNOW. HOW TO GET AROUND ON A WEEKEND OR YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO AS SOMEBODY WHO'S? YOU KNOW TRAIPSING AROUND WITH TWO TEENAGE DAUGHTERS TO ALL THEIR STUFF ON THE WEEKENDS I'D I WISH WE HAD MORE TO YOU KNOW. BE GREATEST ANIMATRONIC. AT LEAST NOT. BUT I. SO ANYWAY I APPLAUD THIS THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL. AND THE FORTY GETTING. THROUGH THE PROCESS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. MISS THE MARK UP DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS GOTCHA YOU SECOND THE MOTION ó LET ME SAY A FEW WORDS. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS YOUR SPONSORS FOR THIS VERY CREATIVE APPROACH TO INCENTIVIZING. HOUSING AROUND TRANSIT INTO FORCE IN ALL OF US TO. DUST UPON IF WE ARE. AND PLANNING AND ZONING LAWS AGAIN. I ALSO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE AMENDMENTS PARTICULARLY FOR GREEN TO ADD THE. NO NET LOSS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENT THAT IS FOUND IN DENSITY BONUS I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO. A ASSURING COMMUNITIES OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT WE NOT ONLY IN THIS CRISIS NEED TO INCENTIVIZE THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING BUT NEED TO INCENTIVIZE IT AROUND TRANSIT. THAT IS TRUE SMART GROWTH AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE AND WITH THAT. AND PREPARED TO SUPPORT THIS. WITH A STRONG AYE RECORD TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. WITH THAT MISTER GLORY OF ANY FINAL COMMENTS JUST APPRECIATION YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THOSE COMMENTS WAS MISTER MAIENSCHEIN. AND A LITTLE EXCITEMENT THIS BILL APPRECIATION TO COUNTS MEMBER GOMEZ FOR COMING UP HERE. TO HELP PRESENT THE BILL IT'S. AGAIN HER IDEA AND I'M REALLY PROUD TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH HER TO GET THIS DONE. OUSLEY WOULD TALK ABOUT BILLY MORE HOUSING FOR WORKING CALIFORNIA'S PEOPLE MAKING THIRTY FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. WE A LOT MORE THAT HOUSING THIS DO THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE. GREAT. WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY COULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CHU HI I MAIENSCHEIN AYE MAIENSCHEIN AYE CHAU. CHAU AYE CHOI AYE AYE CHOI AYE GLORIA AYE AYE. WE MONTH. LIMA I. WOOD. WHICH I. YOUR MEASURES OUT. WE'VE ONE FINAL ITEM AND THAT IS MINDS AT THIS TIME I'M GONNA TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO OUR NEW VICE CHAIR. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN. SEAT WHEN YOU. ARE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES. IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY THIS BILL WOULD RECREATE REDEVELOPMENT AS A TOOL TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ON A REDUCED SCALE AND WITH SIGNIFICANT STATE OVERSIGHT COMPARED TO FORMER REDEVELOPMENT I KNOW I THINK IS. I THINK EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU. SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND YOU UNDERSTOOD. THE CHALLENGES ARE AND WHAT REDEVELOPMENT PROVIDED TO OUR COMMUNITIES. DURING THE PROP THIRTEEN ERA FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WERE CRITICAL FUNNY TOOL FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOUSING. AT THE TIME OF THEIR LIMITATION RDAS REQUIRED TO SPEND A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING STATEWIDE WHICH MEANT. WE LOST A BILLION DOLLARS YEAR WHEN REDEVELOPMENT WAS ENDED. I IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE. AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT CROSSES PARTISAN DIVIDES OUR THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN BRINGING BACK TAX INCREMENT FINANCING TOOLS ARE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING. THE INTENSE NEEDS AROUND HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE. AB THIRTY THIRTY SEVEN WOULD ALLOW THE CITY TO CREATE A REDEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOUSING AGENCY. THIRTY PERCENT THE MONIES GENERATED ANY PROJECT AREA MUST GO TO FUND HOUSING THIS COMPARES TO TWENTY PERCENT FOR FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. WHILE ALL TAXING ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE PROPERTY TAXES CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION TO PARTICIPATE. THE BILL WOULD MAKE COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS HOLE THROUGH PASS THROUGH PAYMENTS AND THE STATE WOULD BACK FILL FUNDS DIVERTED FROM SCHOOLS UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT OBLIGATIONS. ANY NEW AGENCY WOULD APPLY TO THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL FOR REVIEW OF WHETHER PROPOSED ACTIVITY SUPPORT THE STATE'S GOAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. THE SGC WOULD MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE PART OF FINANCE WHO WOULD DETERMINE THE FINAL APPROVAL. ALSO MENTION THIS BILL INCLUDES A CAP ON HOW MUCH THE STATE WOULD CONTRIBUTE EACH YEAR TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S A CONTROL ON THE SIZE OF THIS NEW VERSION OF REDEVELOPMENT. AND THAT IT WILL GROW TO THE SCALE OF FORMER REDEVELOPMENT THAT AMOUNT IS CURRENTLY BLANK AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE RIGHT AMOUNT. TO AVOID EGREGIOUS ABUSES THAT SOME FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES HAD EXPERIENCE LIKE SPENDING MONEYS ON STRIP MALLS OR GOLF COURSES. AB THIRTY THIRTY SEVEN ALSO INCLUDE A NUMBER SIGNIFICANT SAFEGUARDS INCLUDING ROBUST ANTI DISPLACEMENT POLICIES DETAILED RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS. INDEPENDENT ANNUAL AUDITS AND HARSH FINANCIAL PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS. I DON'T THINK THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS WE'VE ENGAGE ON THIS INCLUDING THE DIVERSITY OR ASSEMBLY. MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER IN A WORKING GROUP TO FINE TUNE THIS PROPOSAL. AGAIN WITH BROAD SUPPORT. FROM AROUND THE STATE IN CLOSING THIS IS A BILL THAT IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO RE ESTABLISH REDEVELOPMENT BUT TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY ON A LIMITED SCALE. FOCUSED ON OUR STATES PRIORITIES AND WITH REAL OVERSIGHT AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OUT FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MARINO I OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM WE ARE SUPPORTIVE IN CONCEPT. AND PLEASED TO SEE A INTRODUCTION OF A TRUE REDEVELOPMENT BELL. AS YOU MAY HAVE REMEMBERED SIEGE SUSAN ARDENT SUPPORTER OF REDEVELOPMENT AND THE ROLE IT PLAYED IN BOTH AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION AND KEY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS FOR THE STATE OVERSIGHT PIECE BUT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BEING RESTED IN THE HANDS OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BRIAN AUGUST ON DEATH CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION WE TO ARE SUPPORTIVE IN CONCEPT THERE SOME KEY DETAILS TO BE WORKED OUT AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT WE. MAXIMIZE THE PRODUCTION AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT. I KNOW LAWLER WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY ALSO SUPPORTIVE IN CONCEPT WE APPLIED ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO FOR BEING WILLING TO BRING THIS ISSUE FORWARD. WE CLEARLY SUPPORT THE IDEA OF BRINGING BACK A REDEVELOPMENT TYPE TOOL. AND JUST. NEED TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE DETAILS AND VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THOSE WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SO AS A MATTER NOW WITH WHAT HAS PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIANS PART ABOUT THINKING. TERM BUCKLEY HOUSING CALIFORNIA ALSO SPORTING CONCEPT THAT WE APPLY. THAT LEADERSHIP OF THIS A MEMBER ON THIS EFFORT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING OUT THE DETAILS OF THIS BILL. PHYLLIS ORDER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SUPPORT. SHOT OF BACON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DENKER GUMMY HELPFULLY CALIFORNIA CITIES WERE PART OF THE SPORT AND CONCEPT BY LYING. NAM IF YOU WE REALLY APPRECIATE. THE. THE AUTHOR THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE TAKEN A LEADERSHIP POSITION ON THE US ON. YOU KNOW IT IT OBVIOUSLY IT'S A RECOGNITION THAT ARE REDEVELOPMENT PLAYED REALLY CRITICAL ROLE IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND AND THERE WERE A LOT OF A POLICY BENEFITS OUT FOR THE STATE. ARM WHILE WE HAVE THESE NEW TOOLS OUT THERE AND THE LEAGUE SUPPORTED DEL A NUMBER OF THOSE TOOLS THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL LIFT THAT THE PRIOR TOOL HADN'T AND I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS TRYING TO GET BACK TO THAT. ARE IN ALSO. THEIR WATER COMMENT THIS LOT OF COMMON GROUND BETWEEN CITIES IN THE STATE TERMS OF POLICIES WHETHER STUDIO. HOUSING EXCEPT FOR. I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WERE GOING TO BE LOOKING OUT AS AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON ON THIS IS YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED TO HAVE A TOOL THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE AND AND THAT OBVIOUSLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD WANT TO HAVE TO INITIATE. USE SO NEEDS TO BE OF YOU TO US. THAT YOU KNOW LEAST. YOU NOT NOT TOO ONEROUS IN TERMS OF THE CONDITIONS AND THEN DEPENDABLE OF FUNDING. IF THE FUNDING IS COMMITTED HE CAN'T BE TAKEN AWAY THAT THAT'S PART OF THE LEGACY OF THE PRIOR REDEVELOPMENT THE RISK OF RATES BUDGET RAIDS ON ON REDEVELOPMENT FUNDING. IT NEEDS IF THERE'S FUNDING AND IS TO BE DEPENDABLE SO WE CAN RELY ON A GOING FORWARD. IN THE DETAILS AND CONDITIONS THIS IS GOING TO BE A FORTY FORTY FIVE YEAR ENDEAVOR. LET'S LET'S SET THE RULES LET'S TELL THEM WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT'S NOT CHANGE THEM AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO PEOPLE CAN CAN RELY ON THEM SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THIS MEASURE AND. AND WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S LEADERSHIP. TIFFANY FAN BEHALF OF BRIDGE HOUSING IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WHERE TOP ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WE ARE AYE SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT REMEMBER STORY THE JOBS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES HAVE A CONCERNS POSITIONS ARE KIND ABOUT TWEENER AREA. I MEAN WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE THEIR DIALOGUE WE'VE HAD WITH THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF I'M TO DATE YOU KNOW THIS IS A REALLY MEATY BILL BUILDING ON THE SKELETON WE THINK OF FORMER RDAS AND. UNFORTUNATE OUR CONCERNS ARE BASED ON THE BROADER PROMISE OF THE COMPELLED PARTICIPATION OF ALL LOCAL AGENCIES RATHER THAN THE WILLFUL. PARTICIPATION AND WE DO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THE DRAFTING OF THE MEASURE BUT WE BELIEVE. WE ARE WILL KEEP CONTINUE TO WORK I'M TO GET THROUGH THOSE PROBLEMS AND SPECIFICALLY WITH THE ISSUE OF LOCAL AGENCIES COUNTIES NOT BE MADE WHOLE IN THIS PROCESS. AND AS A SHARE DURING INFORMATIONAL HEARING EARLIER THIS YEAR. AND IT'S BEEN A LONG STANDING. POLICY POSITION IS THAT WE MUST HAVE. WILLFUL CONSENT FROM ALL AGENCIES IN THIS AREA BECAUSE OTHERWISE RESIDENTIALLY TAKING REVENUE FROM A LOCAL AGENCY COUNTY IS A PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND GIVEN IT TO A CITY. FOR THEIR PURPOSES AND WE JUST THINK THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO GO TO REALLY PROVIDE MEANINGFUL AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LONG TERM COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT SO WE HAVE A CONCERNS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M ANTHONY TOWN HALL REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS. AS YOU KNOW IT'S PROBABLY NO SPECIAL DISTRICTS I PROVIDE ESSENTIAL FRONTLINE LOCAL SERVICES FROM. IT WATER AND FLATTENED TO A PARKS AND HEALTH CARE. AND WE SHARE. THE SAME CONCERNS AS OUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE COUNTY. WHERE THE? THE HOW BUREAUCRACY IS NOT CONSENSUAL SO WHERE WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE ON. A ON ON THE NEW I AGENCY BUT WE WEREN'T THERE BY CONSENT. WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PASS THROUGH HOUSE MINISTER BY THE STATE AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT IT ACTUALLY MAKES THIS WHOLE. SHE COULD JEOPARDIZE LOCAL SERVICES I ONE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE ON THESE BIG ISSUES AND BEING OPEN TO THE DISCUSSION. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO TO DO THAT TO WORK THESE ISSUES OUT SO WE ALSO IN A CONCERNS. MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU I'M HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS ALSO JUST EXPRESSING CONCERNS. IT'S NO SECRET FOR THOSE WHO'VE BEEN AROUND THIS CAPITAL WHILE THAT WE'VE PARTNERED WITH THE GOVERNOR IN ELIMINATING REDEVELOPMENT NOT BECAUSE OF ITS EXISTING GOAL TO. REMOVE BLIGHT AND HELP PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE EMBRACE THAT GOAL OUR FIREFIGHTERS CAN'T LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY WORK IT'S IMPORTANT POLICY GOAL. WE'RE JUST CONCERNED THAT THIS MISSES THE MARK AND WILL A. YOU KNOW NOT ALLOW SPECIAL DISTRICTS FIRE DISTRICTS TO HAVE A SAY IN WHERE THEIR PROPERTY TAX INCREMENT GOES AND SO WE WILL PLEDGE TO CONTINUE WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. FIGURE OUT IF THERE ISN'T AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO. MEET BOTH OBJECTIVES THINK. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MICHAEL RATIGAN ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY WE ACTUALLY ALTHOUGH PART OF THE COALITION YOU JUST HEARD FROM. OUR POSITION AS OPPOSED LASSEN MANDATE WE SHARE THE EXACT SAME CONCERNS OF THE COALITION RELATING TO THE. ISSUE OF THE PASSED THE LANGUAGE WERE RELATIVE TO THE PASSED THROUGH AGREEMENT. THE LACK OF. REQUIRING CONCURRENCE OF THE OTHER TAXI HE'S. BUT WE IN FACT HAVE A MEETING SCHEDULED. LATER THIS WEEK TO TO GO OVER OUR SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH. MISTER CHIU STAFF AND WE HOPE WE CAN REACH SOME UNDERSTANDING. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEN NONE PATTERNS COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR TRUCK. THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING. A CONCEPT I I UNDERSTAND THE OUR OFFICE INTENT OF TO. HAVE. THERE ARE REVENUE STREAM FOR AFFORDABLE HOMES SO FROM. TRADITIONAL TWENTY PERCENT TO THIRTY PERCENT. ESSENTIALLY REVIVING NOW OR THE ID A. IN KNOW WHICH FROM THE BEGINNING. YOUR WAS. OF SUCH A SUCH A. THE IN OUR BIG CHAOS ARE. AND THAT DISRUPTED DUH. OUR WERE. ORANGE COUNTY YEAH. OUR GREAT PAUL. WHICH WHY CELLPHONE GOING. UNDER THE R. D. A IT WAS SO. A BIG PROBLEM. NOW EVEN BEFORE THAT TEST IT IS SO SAD OWN NOW WE ARE TRYING TO. IT. IT WILL BE IS ACTUALLY ON THE DIFFERENT NAME ARE ASIA I A NOTCH ON TO REALLY. REVIVED THE HAWORTHIA A LITTLE MORE NOW ALLOCATION. OF THE AFFORDABLE NOW HOME. SHARE. I WONDER IF WHILE WE. PASS THAT IS SO. THEY'RE ALL THE PROBLEMS SO THAT WAS STATED. NOT WHEN THE IDA WAS. ELIMINATED AND. THIS CELL CURRENT. GOVERNOR. WHETHER HE WOULD BUY INTO YOU IDEA AGAIN HE'S STILL A MAIN MAIN NORTH OUT TO US. A ELIMINATE THAT THE ITA. WE THINK ABOUT THAT. SO WHAT A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS AND AND COLLEAGUES FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST THANK YOU FOR ENGAGING WITH US ON THIS SIGNIFICANT TOPIC. I'VE HEARD FROM VIRTUALLY EVERY MEMBER THE LEGISLATURE HAVE SPOKEN ON THIS TOPIC THAT. OF FOLKS WOULD LIKE TO BRING SOME VERSION OF THE TOOL BACK IN THEIR BEEN ATTEMPTS SINCE REDEVELOPMENT WAS. ELIMINATED WITH CREE ISN'T HE AYE IF DIS AN AJ'S AND NIFTY IS TO BRING SOMETHING BACK BUT NONE OF THEM HAVE WORKED IN AND A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WE HAD A HEARING IN THIS COMMITTEE. ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WITH THE TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN CRAFTED SO FAR SO THIS IS REALLY AN ATTEMPT TO TO TAKE A A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD IN THIS AREA BUT I WILL MENTION. COMPARED TO OLD REDEVELOPMENT IN JUST TO PUT THIS AND. AND SCALE NAM AT THE TIME REDEVELOPMENT WAS ELIMINATED. THERE ABOUT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS YEAR THAT WERE SPENT ON A REDEVELOPMENT AND TWENTY PERCENT OF THAT WAS TO GO TO HOUSING. WE ARE PROPOSING REALLY JUST FOCUSING ON THAT HOUSING PORTION AND INFRASTRUCTURE SO UP WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE SPENDING THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE USED TO SPEND ON. AS I REFERRED TO BEFORE IN SOME INSTANCES GOLF COURSES AND STRIP MALLS AND OTHER SORTS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT. I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE THAT WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT SAFEGUARDS AND THIS BILL THAT ADDRESSES THE ISSUES IN THE PAST SO. ROBUST ANTI DISPLACEMENT POLICIES DETAILED RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITS HARSH FINANCIAL PENALTIES AND FINES FOR VIOLATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU ALLUDED TO THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR UNDERSTANDABLY SOME YEARS BEFORE I THINK ANY OF US GOT HERE TO THE LEGISLATURE. WAS FACING A VERY SIGNIFICANT BUDGET CRISIS AND HE. OPPOSED AND IT WAS ACCEPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE WAY TO BALANCE IT WAS TO ADDRESS THE THE FISCAL POLL OF THE RESOURCES THAT HAD BEEN AND REDEVELOPMENT. WHAT WE DO WITH THIS BILL? IS WE WE ALLOW THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT OVERSIGHT ARM AND A PARTICULAR GIVE THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE THE FINAL DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT. ANY PARTICULAR DISTRICT WOULD MOVE FORWARD AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME OBJECTION ABOUT WHETHER THAT IS APPROPRIATE BUT WE THINK PARTICULAR WITH THIS GOVERNOR. ARE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE FISCAL. ISSUES THAT WOULD FACE THIS GOVERNOR OR ANY FUTURE GOVERNOR. TOM I WOULD ALSO SAY A THAT. WE KNOW THAT THIS GOVERNOR HAS HAS BEEN OPPOSED TO BRING HIM BACK DIFFERENT VERSIONS REDEVELOPMENT. WE ARE HOPING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE COMING MONTHS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS THEY MAY HAVE BUT I WILL ALSO SAY. THAT MAJOR GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES WHO ARE OF OF WHICH ONE IS EXPECTED TO TAKE OFFICE OUT EARLY NEXT YEAR HAVE ALL SAID THAT THEY WANT TO BRING BACK A SIGNIFICANT VERSION OF REDEVELOPMENT SO WE ARE TRYING TO DO. EARLY WORK RIGHT NOW TO IRON OUT THE KINKS OF ANY POLICY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE. BLESSING ON US AND I WON ADDRESS. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS WE'VE WORKED HARD IN RECENT MONTHS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION WE ARE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE ALL TAX ALL TAXING ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE PROPERTY TAXES SO THAT INCLUDES CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. TO PARTICIPATE BUT ARE BILL IS DRAFTED TO MAKE COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS HOLE THROUGH PASSED THROUGH PAYMENTS AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME ISSUES AROUND. EXACTLY HOW THAT'S DRAFTED AND A I AM COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS AND LOOK FORWARD. TO HOPEFULLY DOING THAT IN SHORT ORDER AND THEN. AS I MENTIONED FOR THE FUNDS THAT WERE DIVERTED FROM SCHOOLS WOULD BE BACK FILLED UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT SO THIS IS REALLY AGAIN ABOUT GIVING CITIES. LIKE YOU'RE SITTING IN IRVINE THAT THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED. TO ADDRESS AGAIN THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCE IN OUR STATE HISTORY AS WELL AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OF THAT WE HAVE AS WELL. IN ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER WHAT. AS WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR BRING THIS FORWARD. AS AS A FORMER A LOCAL ELECTED WHO WENT THROUGH. THE READ DEVELOPMENT. DISMANTLING. IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR CITIES IN THE LAST MAJOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT WAS BUILT. ONLY THROUGH REDEVELOPMENT AND AS A ABSOLUTE CRITICAL TOOL FOR A COMMUNITY WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT CENTS SO SO I APPLAUD YOU THAT WITH FOR THAT AND I AYE. AYE. AYE AND I KNOW YOU DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE CHALLENGES OF WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE I THINK ANY ANY EFFORTS TO DO ANYTHING RELATED TO REDEVELOPMENT HAVE BEEN. STRONGLY PUSHED BACK ON BUT I I APPRECIATE THAT'S COMPLETELY SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE DOING. ALSO. ALSO DO THAT WITH SOME TREPIDATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHO WAS A HUGE THORN IN OUR SIDE. AND AS HAS REDEVELOPMENT WAS DISMANTLED REMATCH EVERYTHING WE ASK FOR IS A CITY WAS MET WITH THE WORD NO. AND CONSISTENTLY AND WE HAD TO FIGHT AND FIGHT AND FIGHT FOR ANYTHING SO SO I. HOPE THAT. IT WHILE WE'RE GIVING POTENTIALLY GIVING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CONTROL TO APARTMENT OF FINANCE I HOPE THAT THERE ARE SOME GUARDRAILS THERE. OUGHT TO PROTECT A CITIES OF WHO HAVE REALLY GOOD STRONG PROJECTS THERE SO THEY WENT THANK YOU AND I LOOK FOR DISCORDANT BUT. I THINK THEY MISSED WHAT WAS YOUR JOB. TAKE YOU VERY MUCH. I ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR THE CHAIR FOR CARRYING THIS BILL I REMEMBER THAT UNDER THE OLD OF SYSTEM THE OAT RD A ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT BEING DATA. ON YOU KNOW FUNDS IS THAT THEY ARE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR EDUCATION WERE BEING ARE. MR A DATA OR SORTS SUIT SO UNDER YOUR BILL ARE YOU MISSION THAT THAT THE ABOUT NINETY EIGHT FUNDS GOING TO BE BACK FEEL TO IT THAT. ESSENTIALLY FIX WHAT WE HAD ENCOUNTERED IT IN THAT THE BUT THAT WE SPACE THAT'S RIGHT THE MONEY WOULD HE PULL THROUGH THIS BUT BUT PROP NINETY EIGHT WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT SO THE SCHOOLS WHAT HAVE HOPEFULLY BETTER. CORRECTIONAL YES. I GOT THINGS. MITT MISSING THE MARK. THANK YOU AND I WANNA THANK YOU ALSO FOR RAISING THIS CONVERSATION I ACTUALLY WAS PART OF OF THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY THAT HAD REAL CONCERNS WITH REDEVELOPMENT. AND NOT BECAUSE IT DID HAVE MERITS BUT BECAUSE YOU WOULD SEE EXAMPLES OF. ISSUES WHERE IT'S JUST IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM. YOU KNOW ONE POT TO GO INTO SOMETHING THAT JUST DIDN'T SETTLE WELL I THINK IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BUT. IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT'S ALSO THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY THAT IS LOOKING FOR HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES IN COMMUNITIES FOR FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT. SO I'M GLAD THAT IT'S COMING TO S. IN A NINETY YEAR CONCEPT THAT'S VERY FOCUS THAT MUCH MORE NARROW. AND SO THAT IT CAN ALLOW SOME OF US HAVE WHO HAVE HAD CONCERNS. WITH THE USE OF SOME OF THIS IN THE PAST TO REALLY HAVE COME ON BOARD SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL HAPPEN. I KNOW THAT THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY WILL BE INVOLVED BUT I THINK THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES ALL AROUND AND IT'S A MISSING PIECE. OF WHERE RAT NOW AND PART OF THIS LARGER EQUATION OF HOW WE GET TO. SOLVE SOME OF OUR HOUSING COMPLICATIONS. A IN. MYSTERY HITS ACOSTA. THANK YOU CHAIR I. WOULD LIKE TO ASK. ONLY ONE MAJOR. PROBLEMATIC GUY ISSUE IS. THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE pNOT CREATE THAT WE DEVELOP ONE ARE. AGENCY. WITHOUT THOSE VOTER APPROVAL. CAN YOU ELIMINATE THAT THAT THE LEFT ON LOCAL PEOPLE OR TWO. DECIDE THIS IS SOME MAJOR ISSUES SO. THAT'S THE ONLY AREA THAT DOES. IN ROME. DONNA LET THE LOCAL LAWS CITIZENS TO GET INVOLVED. IF THAT THE. IF THAT THAT IS SO GREEDY OF AFFORD TO SUIT THAT DUNLOP BELIEVES. THAT'S HOW IT WAS STRUCTURED UNDER A THAT HAS THAT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION THAT IS HOW IT'S STRUCTURED. HOW REDEVELOPMENT? WAS FORMED FOR AGAIN WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS WE ARE LIMITING WHAT THE USES COULD BE. WITH SIGNIFICANT OVERSIGHT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WITH SIGNIFICANT SAFEGUARDS AND GUARD RAILS ARE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS FOCUSED ON. ON ON CRITICAL HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WITH ALL OF THE LEVELS OF PURPLE APPROVALS THAT I DESCRIBED BEFORE. BUT THE QUICK ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT IS HOW IT'S STRUCTURED UNDER THE CONSTITUTION THE STATE CONSTITUTION. SO IT UNDER THE STATE CONSTITUTION ALLOWS REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES DO NOT REQUIRE A VOTE OF A LOCAL JURISDICTION BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING WITH THIS LAW IS YOU HAVE TO. AGAIN GET THE APPROVALS THAT WE DISCUSSED WITH THE SAFEGUARDS THAT WE DISCUSSED AS WELL. THANK. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS. AND FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS I. FIND MYSELF. IN. AGREEMENT WITH NUMBER THE WITNESSES WHO ARE KIND OF SUPPORTIVE AND CONCEPT. I'MI THINK IT ILLUSTRATES THE THE HUGE GAP. THAT OCCURRED AS A LOSS OF REDEVELOPMENT. AND YOU KNOW. S. SOMEBODY IN WHEN I TOOK. AS ME WHO WORKS A LOT IN THIS AREA WHEN I TOOK OFFICE ON THE CITY THE CITY COUNCIL OUR DOWNTOWN WAS JUST UNSAFE IT WAS UNPRODUCTIVE ME WAS A MASS YOU CAN WALK AROUND AT NIGHT. I'M AND NOW YOU KNOW ALL I HEAR YOU KNOW APPEAR AS WE LOVE YOUR CITY IT'S WONDERFUL TO COME DOWN AND VISIT WE YOUR DOUBT YOUR GASLAMP AREAS GREAT WE BUILT A BALLPARK WE. REDEVELOPMENT ALL THAT WE IT WASN'T JUST. ECHO PARK WHICH WAS INDUCES FOURTEEN AREAS FOURTEEN BLOCKS I IN AROUND THERE THAT WE REDEVELOP AT BRIAN RESTAURANTS BARS AND. LOT OF INCOME PRODUCING. REVENUE LOT OF JOBS INCOME PRODUCING REVENUE FOR THAT. FOR THE CITY AS WELL AND SUCH A HUGE LOSS IT'S A HUGE LOSS TO WHAT WE DID ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING YOU JUST WHAT WE GET FOR THE HOMELESS. INTO MY COLLEAGUE MS AT AT THE TIME AND I GET THE IS STILL TO MISS ATKINS AND I. KNOW WE REALLY CHAMPION LET'S GET MORE DONE ON A FOUR HOUSING WAS TOO MORE FOR HOMELESS WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT. THROUGH THE REDEVELOPMENT AND IS PROTECTED FRUSTRATING TO SEE A NOTE THERE BUT THERE WERE RAISING OF PEOPLE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT WILL THERE BE FURTHER RAIDS ON THESE REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS. CERTAINLY AN ISSUE WITH COME TO THIS SORT OF COMPELLED PARTICIPATION AS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF VOTER APPROVAL. ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK AGAIN I JUST GO WITH MY EXPERIENCE WHAT REALLY HELPED US ON REDEVELOPMENTS WE HAD SUCH BY IAN. I IN WE HAD THAT WE DEFER HAD. THE NAY SAYERS AND THAT AND THE PEOPLE WHO GOT A LOT OF MEDIA ATTENTION BUT BY AND LARGE PEOPLE WERE. WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING INTERESTINGLY NOW THAT WE HAVE THE BALLPARK AND ALL THAT EVERYBODY OF COURSE A SPORT OF BUT. BUT WE WERE ABLE TO GET THAT THAT DOWN IN THAT IN THAT WAY I'M. ALSO A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE CHEFS IN MONEY. THAT MAY GO AWAY FROM AYE AYE INTO WHETHER IT'S LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIREFIGHTERS. SOME OF THE OTHER PUBLIC SERVICE I THINK THAT CHYNA NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT FUNDAMENTALLY. I I APPLAUD WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I AND I THINK IT'S. IT'S TOO BAD WE'RE COMEY PUT IN THIS POSITION IN SOME SENSE OF WERE TRYING TO FIND BECAUSE REDEVELOPMENT GONE IN AND AN OVERALL REDEVELOPMENT DID SO MUCH GOOD THERE. SURLY THERE WERE INSTANCES WHERE IS ABUSE BUT THOSE SHOULD OF BEEN ADDRESSED NOW IT'S TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION. YOU A CAB MORE MORE PIECEMEAL SO. I AYE I WON'T SUPPORT IT TODAY OUT I WILL CONTINUE TO IN I'LL OFFER. YOU KNOW TO TO WORK WITH YOU GOING FORWARD ON THIS I KNOW YOUR. PASSIONS ARE AND I THINK YOUR HEAT FOR MAKING SOME SOME PROGRESS I JUST CAN'T QUITE GET THERE. TODAY SO WITH THAT AND WE HAVE A MOTION. MOTION FOR MR CHOW SECOND FROM MISTER WHAT MISTER CHAIR REJECT CLOSE SHIRT LET ME JUST CLOSE WITH TWO POINTS A AYE AYE HERE FROM OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS A LACK OF VOTER APPROVAL. WERE NOT INCREASING. HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW FUNDS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO YOUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHERE THEY CAN BE USED. BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT RAISING PROPERTY TAXES WERE TALKING ABOUT. THE FLOWS OF FUNDS COMING BACK IN AND WHERE THEY SHOULD BE USED WHERE THEY SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED. I THINK GIVEN THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE HAVE GIVEN THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS THAT WE HAVE THE HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN SAN DIEGO THE ENCAMPMENTS THAT WERE SEEN IN ORANGE COUNTY. OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WERE SEEN AND. AS THE MONTHS DISTRICT AND DOCTOR WHICH DISTRICT GIVEN THE FIRES AND MUD SLIDES WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN CITIES LIKE MINE AND AND AND EVERY CITY IN THE IN THE STATE. OF THIS CRISIS WAS CAUSED IN PART BECAUSE OF THE REDEVELOPED THAT THE ELIMINATION OF REDEVELOPMENT AND THE LOSS OF A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FUNDING. AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO TO BRING THAT BACK. BUT DO IT WITH THE APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF OF CONTROL AND AND OVERSIGHT ARE AS WELL AS WITH WITH BY AND FROM LOCALITIES. IN A WAY THAT THAT HOLDS A HARMLESS A AND INSURES THAT SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN FAR DISTRICTS IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MADE WHOLE. SO THAT IS THE INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS IS COMPLICATED AYE IT IS GOING TO BE A LONGER TERM CONVERSATION. WHAT I CAN TELL YOU I DO HOPE WE CAN RESOLVE IT THIS YEAR BUT IT IS NOT RESOLVED THIS YEAR IT WILL CERTAINLY? BE ISSUE WE'RE GOING TO BE TACKLING AND AND AND STRONG FORCE EARLY NEXT YEAR WITH WHOEVER THE NEXT GOVERNOR AT SO MY HOPE IS A WHAT I WOULD ASK. A ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES IS TO CONTINUE TO GIVE US INPUT AS WE GO THROUGH THIS I DO HOPE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. WELL IF YOU HAVE ONE WHAT KIND OF RAT. WAS. VOTING NOW DIY FOR AT RISK. YEAH I'M IN IMPORTANT BETWEEN US MUCH US OUT IN A PERSON WE HAD A VERY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE SAID AND I'D LOVE TO SUPPORT HIS ABOUT THEIR. AT THAT TIME IF THE SO DYSPHORIA OF IP IT. WHEN YOU ARE A DEVELOPED BY A OUT OF REDEVELOPMENT PLAN THAT THE CITY OUT WALK COUNTY IT WOULD IT WOULD HAVE A PLAN HOW YOU WHEN I. READ DEVELOPER INDIA SO YOU WOULD HAVE ARE YOU KNOW MASTER PLAN AND THE OWNERS. WHAT DID THE CITIZENS SO WHO IS THE LEADING IN THAT AREA SHOULD HAVE A FOR A SAFE TO SOMEONE THE FOR? OUR PLAN COMING THERE WERE BY INTO IT. SO PATRICIA WE ACTUALLY WE THAT THE THE BILL DOESN'T VISION THAT THE AGENCY HAS TO PROVIDE A PLAN OF THE MONIES CAN BE USED FOR. IS OTHER IN THEIR LIFE AND JUST WELCOME AT THE GENERAL PLAN KNOW WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CONSTITUTION NOR DOES NOT ALLOW THAT THE I DON'T KNOW QUITE UNDERSTAND SO INVESTED THE PHOTO INVOLVEMENT DESIST ABOUT THAT. IT IN AWE HOW HOW IT THE TAX INCREMENT THE NOT TAX SOME MONEY WOULD BE USED OF SO. THOSE OF CITIZENS ARE LIVING INSIDE SHOULD HAVE SOME VOICE SO LET ME IT THIS IS THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHEN YOU'RE ON THE CITY COUNCIL. AND YOU MADE DECISIONS WITH YOUR CITY COUNCIL HAVE YOUR GENERAL FUND WAS USED YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK TO VOTERS. FOR A VOTE OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY YOU SPENT ON POLICE AND FIRE AND. SOCIAL SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH. YOU WERE ENTRUSTED WITH THAT VOTE AND THAT'S HOW THE STRUCTURE OR NOT INCREASING TAXES THIS IS A WAY FOR. A THESE JURISDICTIONS TO DECIDE HOW MONIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE FLOWING TO THE JURISDICTION WOULD BE USED AND. PART OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS WE WANT TO GIVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ABILITY TO CREATE A STRUCTURE. TO MOVE SOME OF THIS FUNDING TOWARD HOUSING AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ALL DEFINED IN THE IN THE BILL. SO THAT CITIES LIKE IRVINE I CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE RELIEF WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE TODAY THAT'S THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT. FORMOSA CITIZENS INVOLVED THE WITHIN THAT. REDUCED THAT THE RETIREMENT AREA HAD THE VOICE THAT THE BOARD ON IT THEY WOULD HAVE A VOICE THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROCESS. THAT THE AGENCY WOULD SET UP. SO SHORT OF A VOTE IT'S NOT AN ACTUAL WOULD ATTACH A PHOTO APPROVAL OF FATTY SAYS SOMETHING IN OUR BUT IT BOTHERS ME. I AGAIN I APPRECIATE WHAT IT WHAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT INCREASING TAXES. WORK WILL TALK ABOUT THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS IN THE WAY THAT A CITY COUNCIL WOULD WOULD DECIDE HOW TO USE. GENERAL FUNDS. WE HAVE A MOTION TO PASS TO LOCAL GRAVEL AND THAT SECOND ESCORT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MAIENSCHEIN. NO MAIENSCHEIN NO CHAU. SHALL I. CHOI. RELUCTANTLY KNOWN. SHOWING NO GLORIA. LIMON.
