INTERCONNECTION AND EMISSIONS CONTROL DEVICES- ALSO ON LASTLY MAKES TECHNICAL CHANGES TO OF THE STATE TO CLAIM. THE FEDERAL AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT FUNDING WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. FOR S. B. ONE ONE FIVE. THANK YOU MISS TANK AND MR FONG YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. BUT I DID IT IS ON ALL RIGHT. I THINK ANY SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB ONE FIFTEEN THIS BILL IS A PATCHWORK OF CHANGES TO LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THE FACT THAT THIS IS NOW THE SIXTH ITERATION ITERATION OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT CAN ONLY MEAN THAT THE BUDGET PASSED LAST YEAR WAS RUSHED AND NEEDED TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT. THIS BILL SPANS NEARLY ANOTHER. TWO BILLION DOLLARS ON COVERED RESPONSE WITHOUT PROVIDING SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION. INCLUDING SEVERAL NO BID CONTRACTS WITH A NUMBER OF US HAVE ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT. MEMBERS THE MEASURE OF SUCCESS IS NOT DEFINED BY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THE STATE SPENDS. IT THERE MUST BE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS. THE STATE SPENDING OF THE OF THE STATE SPENDING OF TAXPAYER MONIES THE GOVERNOR'S AGGRESSION ON TRADITIONAL ENERGY IS ONCE AGAIN COSTING TAXPAYERS MILLIONS. THIS MINUTE ADMINISTRATION IS DETERMINED TO KILL SKILLED WELL PAYING JOBS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR. DESPITE ATTEMPTS TO FORCE OIL AND NATURAL GAS OUT OF THE MARKET CLOSING NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS IN DEMOLISHING JANET J. DAMS THE STATE IS BACK TO SQUARE ONE. LAST YEAR. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SPENT OVER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS ON NATURAL GAS GENERATORS TO MAKE UP FOR A LACK OF ENERGY SUPPLY. TO PREVENT ROLLING BLACKOUTS AND NOW. ANOTHER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IS NEEDED TO MEET SELF IMPOSED REGULATIONS. WE NEED A DIVERSE ENERGY PORTFOLIO TO MEET THE RISING ENERGY DEMANDS OF CALIFORNIANS PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY CLEARLY IS NOT THE ANSWER TO SOLVING OUR ENERGY PROBLEMS. THE BUDGET BILL IS ALSO NO PLACE TO EXAM TWO CONTRACTS FROM OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW AND TRANSPARENCY. THEY CONTRACT MUST BE DISCLOSED DEBATED AND ALLOW FOR PUBLIC. INPUT AND PARTICIPATION. A RUSHED FOR ABOUT MERE HOURS AFTER DISCUSSING THIS BILL IN COMMITTEE IS INAPPROPRIATE THIS IS NOT HOW THE BUDGET PROCESS SHOULD WORK. WITH ANOTHER GENEROUS SURPLUS WE HAVE ANTICIPATED STATE APPROPRIATION LIMIT ISSUES AND MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE CALLS FOR TAX RELIEF PERMANENTLY AND REBATES FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT INSTEAD THIS BILL PLACE SHOW GAMES WOULD COVER RESPONSE FUNDS TO GET AROUND AGAIN LIMIT. CALIFORNIANS ARE OVERTAXED AND FRUSTRATED WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT DOES NOT LISTEN TO THEM AND FOR THESE REASONS MEMBERS I ASPIRIN BY NOVO. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. ON THE BUDGET ITEM. CLARK WELL OVER THERE ALL. DESIRE TO VOTE ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE. DESIRE TO VOTE. CLARK WELL. CLOSE ROLL TIDE ABOUT AYE AYES FIFTY KNOWS FIVE. THAT MEASURE PASSES. AND WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO TAKE UP. FILE ITEM. TWENTY FOUR. OKAY MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A FILE ITEM TWENTY FOUR. FILE ITEM. TWENTY FOUR. SENATE BILL ONE THIRTEEN CORKERY SENATE BILL ONE THIRTEEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW WHEN ACCORDING TO ECONOMIC RELIEF MAKING APPROPRIATION AIR FORCE TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY PRIVILEGE FOR THE BUDGET. MISTER CHANG YOUR MAIL BUT- I THINK IT WAS SPEAKER LET ME- RIGHT OFF I THINK SB ONE THIRTEEN IS OUR CORPORATE NINETEEN ECONOMIC RELIEF BILL. ALL THE MAJOR ITEM IN THE BILL IS THE REPEAL OF THE TEMPORARY LIMIT ON NET OPERATING LOSS DEDUCTION THE TAX CREDITS ONE YEAR EARLIER- BY REMOVING THE LIMITSFOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO LET ME JUST THANK YOU. MISTER SPEAKER AS WELLAS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY FOR REALLY ABOUT LEADING THE EFFORT ON THIS REPEAL IT ALSO CONFORMS STATE TAX LAW TO FEDERAL LAW FOR THE RESTAURANT REVITALIZATION FOR THE START OF VENUES ORGANIZATION GRANTS. TO EXCLUDE PANDEMIC RELATED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FROM STATE TAXABLE INCOME. FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO THE OFFICE BUSINESS. FOR SMALL BUSINESS FOR A SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM TO FUND. ALL THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ON THE WAIT LIST TO APPLIED. EARLIER LAST YEAR. IT ALSO MAKES A VARIETY OF CHANGES RELATED TO A TAX CREDIT PROGRAM THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET AND ENSURE THAT THE BENEFITS OF UTILITY CUSTOMERS. RECEIVED A MASTER'S BUDGET ARE NOT TAXABLE AND EXEMPT FOR DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. WITHOUT A RESPECT THAT'S PRIVATE FOR S. B. ONE ONE THREE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS HER FOGGY ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE ONE THREE CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYERS HAVE ENDURED TREMENDOUS PRESSURE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE THEY NEED ASMUCH RELIEF AS THEY CAN GET. THIS BILL AS A NEEDED STEP. MEMBERS CALIFORNIA RANKS ALMOST DEAD LAST IN BUSINESS TAX CLIMATE IN THE NATION. RESTORING THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT AND NOT NET OPERATING LOSS DEDUCTIONS IS ONE OF THE MOST DIRECT WAYS TO HELP EMPLOYERS SUSTAIN THEIR BUSINESSES AND HIRE WORKERS. WITH ANOTHER YEAR OF MULTI BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUSES. IT MAKES SENSE TO RESTORE TAX RELIEF TO RETAIN BUSINESSES IN OUR STATE. BUT IT IS EVIDENCE THAT CALIFORNIA OVER TAXES CALIFORNIANS AND BUSINESSES. THE STAGE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO KEEP BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BENEFIT CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. THIS BILL ALSO PROVIDES NEEDED CONFORMITY WITH FEDERAL TAX LAWS SO THAT SMALL BUSINESSES DO NOT HAVE TO PAY TAXES ON FEDERAL RELIEF PROVIDED TO PERSEVERE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND IT ALSO PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR COVERED NINETEEN RELIEF GRANTS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL. BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE HERE IS THE NEED FOR MORE TAX RELIEF FOR CALIFORNIANS AND SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO LIVE AND WORK IN OUR STATE. I URGE AND I'VE OUT. THANK YOU THUS FAR. THIS PETRIE-NORRIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT AS SB ONE ONE THREE AND IN SOME RESPECTS THIS FEELS LIKE AN IMPORTANT TURNING POINT IN OUR BATTLE AGAINST THE KEVIN NINETEEN PANDEMIC AS OUR BUDGET CHAIR I'VE SHARED IN HIS OPENING REMARKS. TWO YEARS AGO AS WE CONFRONTED THE EARLY STAGES OF THE COVET NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY. WE STOOD ON THE FLOOR AND WE MADE SOME VERY TOUGH CHOICES I IN ORDER TO BALANCE OUR STATE'S BUDGET THAT INCLUDED. THE TEMPORARY LIMITATION OF NET OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDITS FOR CALIFORNIA COMPANIES. WE ARE MORE THAN TWO YEARS INTOTHIS PANDEMIC THE TOOL HAS BEEN DEVASTATING BUT BLESSEDLY WE DO FIND OURSELVES REALLY AND TRULY AT A TURNING POINT WE HAVE THE TREATMENTS OF THE VACCINES THE TOOLS THAT ARE ENABLING US. TO MANAGE THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND WE FIND OURSELVES BLESSED WITH THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THE SMART INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO REBUILD CALIFORNIA AND SAID OUR ECONOMY ON A ROBUST PATH TO RECOVERY. THIS ISN'T A QUESTION OF WHETHER WE PRIORITIZE PUBLIC HEALTH OR PRIORITIZE JOB CREATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH WE CAN AND MUST DO BOTH AND THIS MEASURE DOES JUST THAT SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY. URGE AND I BET. THANK YOU MISS PITCHER NORRIS. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE ITEM. CARCLUB THE ROLE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE IS THAT A VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. CLARK WELL. CLOSE ROLL TIDE ABOUT I. SIXTY FOUR NO ZERO THAT MEASURE PASSES. THIS IS FILE ITEM. TWENTY FIVE. S. B.

MISTER CHANG YEAR MEGAN OPEN. THANK YOU A SPEAKER S. B. R. ONE FOURTEEN IS OUR SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE A PROPOSAL LAST YEAR AS THE ENTIRE STATE GRAPPLED WITH COVERT WE HAD SO MANY EMPLOYEES WHO WENT TO WORK GET SICK THIS FLOOR PASSED AND ADOPTED SB NINETY FIVE WHICH CREATED A COVERT NINETEEN SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE PROPOSAL. HARPER FOR BUSINESSES WITH MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPOSAL EXPIRED IN TWENTY FIVE SORRY IN SEPTEMBER BECAUSE WE WERE UNABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT TO EXTEND. THE DAY I'M VERY PROUD TO PRESENT TO YOU THANKS IN LARGE PART TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES OUR FABULOUS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEES ARE FORTUNATE. SB ONE ONE FOUR WHICH WILL EXTEND THE PROVISIONS OF SB. CONTINUE TO GO TO WORK CONTINUE TO GET SICK ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE TIME OFF AND GET THE SICK LEAVE THAT THEY REALLY DESERVE. SB ONE ONE FOUR APPLIES TO EMPLOYERS WITH TWENTY SIX OR MORE EMPLOYEES. AS A FORTY HOUR SICK LEAVE POLICY ITH AN ADDITIONAL. FORTY HOURS UNDER CERTAIN STEPS CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDES PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO BOOSTER SHOTS AS WELL AS DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS IN THIS BILL WILL EXPIRE ON SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH. OF THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITHOUT RESPECT RESTAURANT I BUILT FOR SB ONE ONE FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER FONG YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS I AM FORCING THE RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB ONE ONE FOUR THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO THIS BILL REQUIRING SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS TO PAY UP TO TWO WEEKS OF SICK PAY LEAVE ON TOP OF EXISTING PAID LEAVE IS A FINANCIAL BURDEN THAT COULD BANKRUPT A LOCAL STORE A LOCAL RESTAURANT OR A NONPROFIT THAT'S BARELY HOLDING ON BY THE SKIN OF THEIR TEETH. THIS MEASURE WILL NOT ONLY HARM SMALL BUSINESSES IT WILL HURT NONPROFITS LIKE A LOCAL HOMELESS CENTER IN KERN COUNTY WHO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY'S MOST AFFORDABLE NEIGHBORS AND DID NOT KNOW THE BUDGET A RETROACTIVE EXPENSE LIKE THIS IN ONE NOW LOOK TO REDIRECT FUNDS AT A CRITICAL TIME. MEMBERS WHY NOT OFFSET THESE COSTS WITH A STATE TAX CREDIT OR EXEMPTION THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE PROVIDED ESTIMATES OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO OVER A BILLION DOLLARS OF COSTS BORNE ENTIRELY. BY BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS STATEWIDE THERE IS NO RELIEF PROVIDED FOR THIS AND THE BILL BEFORE WE DISCUSS PROVIDING TAX RELIEF AND TRIED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT SACRAMENTO IS BURDENING SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE VERY NEXT BILL THERE IS A NEED. A MANDATE ON SMALL BUSINESSES WITH NO OFFSET AND NO RELIEF PROVIDED. THIS POLICY THAT IS BEING RUSHED TO THE LEGISLATURE NEEDED NEEDS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT MORE DEBATE AND DISCUSSION. IT IS FRUSTRATING BUT AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT THERE'S SOME ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE PLIGHT OF THE CRUSHING COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUSINESSES AND CHARITIES THE PAST TWO YEARS. AND FOR SOME. IT WAS TOO LATE. AS MANY CLOSE THEIR DOORS FOR GOOD. THIS PROPOSAL IS GOING TO LAYER ADDITIONAL COSTS AND BURDENS ON TOP OF AN ALREADY DIFFICULT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. MEMBERS I REGRETFULLY I URGE A NO VOTE. FAMOUS FONG MISS CARILLO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. CHECK CHECK OKAY THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE ONE FOUR WHICH BRINGS BACK OPEN NINETEENTH OF WOMEN TO SICK LEAVE FOR EVERY DAY WORKERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN WE ADJOURNED LAST YEAR LAST SESSION. WE DID SO WITHOUT CONTEMPLATING THE LIKES OF A NEW CORONAVIRUS STRAIN LIKE OMICRON WHICH DISRUPTED THE PROGRESS WE HAD MADE A BRINGING SOME LEVEL OF NORMALCY BACK INTO OUR LIVES NEARLY TWO YEARS INTO THE PANDEMIC TO PUT THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE. THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH STATED JUST LAST MONTH THAT WE WERE EXPERIENCING THE HIGHEST CASE NUMBERS EVER EXCEEDING ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES ON A DAILY BASIS LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE WHERE MY DISTRICT IS LOCATED EXCEEDED MORE THAN TWO MILLION CONFIRMED CASES IN PART CAUSED BY THE RAPID SPREAD. OF THE VARIANTS. JUST LIKE THAT. THE LIVES OF OUR WORKFORCE WAS UPENDED A MISS THIS SURGE FORCING MANY TO WORK SICK OR TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN LOSING THEIR JOB. OR TAKING CARE OF THEIR HEALTH OR THE HEALTH OF A LOVED ONE. THIS IS NOT AN OPTION THAT PEOPLE SHOULD EVER HAVE TO MAKE NOT IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE WERE FORCED TO DO SO BECAUSE THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE LAW WHICH- WE PREVIOUSLY PASSED HERE IN CALIFORNIA EXPIRED SEPTEMBER THIRTY OF LAST YEAR. FOUR MONTHS. THIS CHOICE ALONE IN THE LACK OF A SAFETY NET FOR OUR WORKFORCE MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OVER EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS. TESTING POSITIVE FOR COVERT NINETEEN AND MORE THAN EIGHTY THOUSAND LIVES LOST TO THE VIRUS TO DATE. TODAY'S VOTE ON THIS BILL IS ONE OF A SOCIAL AND MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS BECAUSE COLBERT NINETEEN. IS TRULY A LIFE OR DEATH ISSUE THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY AFFECTS THE HEALTH OF THOSE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY IT BUT PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS. AS WELL WHICH IN TURNS THAT AFFECTS THE HEALTH OF OUR ECONOMY. HOW MANY OF YOU. SALT BUSINESSES AND RESTAURANTS CLOSING THEIR DOORS AGAIN TEMPORARILY BECAUSE OF THIS VARIANT. I DARE TO SAY THAT WE ALL DID. I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME ORGANIZATIONS ARE REPRESENTING THESE GROUPS THAT STAND IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL ON GROUNDS THAT IS DUPLICATIVE OF A LEAVE REQUIREMENTS THEY SPECIFICALLY ARGUE THAT EMPLOYEES EXPOSED TO COVERT NINETEEN AT WORK OR WHERE OR WHERE THE EMPLOYER CANNOT. DISAPPROVE OF AN OCCURRENCE OR DISAPPROVE OF AN OCCURRENCE ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE FOR EXCLUSION PAY UNDER CAL OSHA'S COVERT NINETEEN EMERGENCY TEMPORARY STANDARD OR THAT EMPLOYERS PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL LEAVE BENEFITS BENEFITS OF THEIR OWN AS WELL. WHAT THEY FAIL TO ACKNOWLEDGE HOWEVER IS THE WORKER WHO DOES NOT CONTRACT THE VIRUS AT WORK WHO DOES NOT HAVE AN EMPLOYER THAT PROVIDES IN THE BENEFIT OR THE NEEDS TO CARE FOR A FAMILY MEMBER. OR A CHILD WHO HAS FALLEN ILL BECAUSE OF CODE WHICH IN ALL CASES FORCES THEM TO WORK SICK OR LOSE THEIR JOB AS STATED EARLIER. HAVING SAID THIS WE ARE NOT OBLIVIOUS TO THE STRUGGLES OF BUSINESS COMMUNITY DURING THIS PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY OUR SMALL BUSINESSES FOR THIS REASON WE ARE NOT ONLY TAKING ACTIONS TODAY THAT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR BUSINESSES IN THE FORM OF SOME TAX CREDITS BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE ADDITIONAL NEEDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES BECAUSE THAT'S STATED BY THE GOVERNOR BY THE PRO TEM AND ARE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN. IF THERE IS ONE LESSON. WE HAVE LEARNED FROM LAST YEAR'S ACTION ON SUPPLEMENTAL SICK LEAVE. IS THAT WE DID IT IT WORKED AND WE CAN DO IT AGAIN. TODAY'S EARLY BUDGET ACTIONS ARE RIGHT FOR WORKERS BUSINESSES AND OUR ECONOMY THESE ISSUES ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE WE CAN DO ALL OF IT. THE BIGGEST UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE TO DOING NTHING. IS CONTINUING THE LOSS OF LIFE ACROSS OUR STATE. MEMBERS LET'S CONTINUE TO HELP THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT CALL CALIFORNIA HOME AMID THIS PANDEMIC AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE AND I VOTE ON SB ONE ONE FOUR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS CREO. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE ITEM. MISTER CHANG YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU FOR SPEAK APPRECIATE MY CALL WHICH OF COMMENTS FROM OUR VICE CHAIR AS WELL AS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN ANGELES SB ONE ONE FORCE A MEASURE THAT'S ACTUALLY CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT WE SUPPORT ALL THE WORKERS WITH KEPT OUR ECONOMY OPEN. UP A RESTAURANT OPEN COOPER SMALL BUSINESSES OPEN REALLY COMMITTED SO THAT WE CAN GET THROUGH THE WEEK TO CONTINUE TO GO ON WITH OUR LIVES AND THEY PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK BUT THE LIVELIHOOD TO REST SO I THINK THE COVERT SICK LEAVE IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO. HAVING SAID THAT HIGH I DO A ONE ALLIANCE MYSELF WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS MY FRAZIER MADE TO ENSURE THAT THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO DEFINITELY NEED FINANCIAL LEAVE GET THAT RELIEF WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THAT THE TO THIS PROPOSAL BUT SOMETHING THAT WE CONTINUE TO. TALK ABOUT WE REALLY WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT IN THE JUNE BUDGET PROPOSAL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT BECAUSE THE FEDERAL AID IS NOT THERE THAT STATE AID WORK TO HELP THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE HAVING TO BEAR SOME OF HIS BRENT FOR CALL THE SICKLY.
