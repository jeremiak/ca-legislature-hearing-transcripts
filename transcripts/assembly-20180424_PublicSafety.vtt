REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE JURY POOL

00:29:07.779 --> 00:29:11.817 region:rollup2

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.490 region:rollup2
MORE OF AN INCONVENIENCE

00:29:16.722 --> 00:29:20.926 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE WHO ARE REMAINING AND

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:22.661 region:rollup2
REALLY JURY SERVICE IS NOT AN

00:29:20.926 --> 00:29:24.496 region:rollup2
INCONVENIENCE IMPEDIMENT TO OUR

00:29:22.661 --> 00:29:26.231 region:rollup2
DAY. THAT'S A FOUNDATIONAL PART

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:28.634 region:rollup2
OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM.

IN RESPECT FOR OPPOSITION.

00:29:35.641 --> 00:29:40.412 region:rollup2
TO THE BILL.

00:29:37.142 --> 00:29:42.347 region:rollup2
I ECHO THE STATE THE STATEMENTS

00:29:40.412 --> 00:29:43.782 region:rollup2
BY LEXI HOWARD AS FAR AS THE

00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:44.416 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT.

00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:46.018 region:rollup2
HOW?

00:29:44.416 --> 00:29:47.719 region:rollup2
THIS BILL COULD IMPACT THE JURY

00:29:46.018 --> 00:29:49.988 region:rollup2
POOL.

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:50.255 region:rollup2
AND THE COUNCIL HAS A LONG

00:29:49.988 --> 00:29:51.456 region:rollup2
STANDING.

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:53.625 region:rollup2
.

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:56.261 region:rollup2
POLICY OF OPPOSING CATEGORICAL

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:58.497 region:rollup2
EXEMPTIONS FROM JURY SERVICE.

00:29:56.261 --> 00:30:01.633 region:rollup2
AND HAS FOUND THAT.

00:29:58.497 --> 00:30:03.702 region:rollup2
STATUTORILY EXEMPTING CERTAIN

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:06.471 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES OF PERSONS REDUCES

00:30:03.702 --> 00:30:07.973 region:rollup2
THE. NUMBER OF AVAILABLE JURIES

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:10.642 region:rollup2
MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

00:30:07.973 --> 00:30:12.010 region:rollup2
SELECT REPRESENTATIVE JURIES AND

00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:14.546 region:rollup2
UNFAIRLY INCREASES THE BURDEN OF

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:16.081 region:rollup2
JURY SERVICE. ON OTHERS SEGMENTS

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:17.516 region:rollup2
OF THE POPULATION AND SO WITH

00:30:16.081 --> 00:30:20.085 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A CONCERN AT

00:30:17.516 --> 00:30:23.221 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO. EXPAND.

00:30:20.085 --> 00:30:24.189 region:rollup2
THE CATEGORIES OF PERSONS TO.

00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:26.458 region:rollup2
DO NOT HAVE TO.

00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:29.261 region:rollup2
SERVE ON JURIES.

00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:31.730 region:rollup2
FURTHER REDUCES THAT PULL.

00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:32.564 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS THE CONCERN THAT

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.965 region:rollup2
COURTS HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL

00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:36.301 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT

00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:38.003 region:rollup2
TRIPLES. ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF

00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:39.438 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT THERE

00:30:38.003 --> 00:30:41.173 region:rollup2
ARE ENOUGH.

00:30:39.438 --> 00:30:43.275 region:rollup2
PROSPECTIVE JURORS IN THE

00:30:41.173 --> 00:30:44.710 region:rollup2
COURTHOUSE EACH DAY. TO AVOID

00:30:43.275 --> 00:30:47.612 region:rollup2
HAVING TO DISMISS.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:50.048 region:rollup2
LAST A CRIMINAL TRIALS FOR LACK

00:30:47.612 --> 00:30:52.651 region:rollup2
OF JURORS EXCITER HAVE.

00:30:50.048 --> 00:30:53.618 region:rollup2
AND AND IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS

00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:55.087 region:rollup2
RAISED.

00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:58.023 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY BY THE PUBLIC

00:30:55.087 --> 00:31:00.192 region:rollup2
SAFETY HUMANITY THAT.

00:30:58.023 --> 00:31:02.194 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL COUNCIL ADOPTED

00:31:00.192 --> 00:31:04.362 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ROLLS RULE OF COURT

00:31:02.194 --> 00:31:06.231 region:rollup2
RULED TWO POINT ONE ZERO ZERO

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:08.033 region:rollup2
EIGHT WHICH ALLOWS A HARDSHIP

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:09.634 region:rollup2
EXEMPTION VARIOUS OUR CHIPS

00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:12.838 region:rollup2
EXAMS EXEMPTIONS. BUT THERE'S

00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:13.939 region:rollup2
ONE SPECIFIC TO THE PUBLIC

00:31:12.838 --> 00:31:14.673 region:rollup2
SAFETY COMMUNITY.

00:31:13.939 --> 00:31:17.175 region:rollup2
WHICH.

00:31:14.673 --> 00:31:20.011 region:rollup2
PROVIDES A EXEMPTION.

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:22.180 region:rollup2
WHEN THE SERVICES THEIR SERVICES

00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:23.782 region:rollup2
ARE IMMEDIATE NEEDED FOR OR THE

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:25.550 region:rollup2
PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:31:23.782 --> 00:31:27.419 region:rollup2
AND SAFETY.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:29.354 region:rollup2
AND IN CONCLUSION COURTS MUST

00:31:27.419 --> 00:31:31.323 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY BALANCE THE NEED TO

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:33.091 region:rollup2
ENSURE ACCESS TO. THE JUSTICE

JURORS TIMES.

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:38.063 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WHILE JURY SERVICE

00:31:36.428 --> 00:31:40.232 region:rollup2
REQUIRE SACRIFICE ON THE PART OF

CITIZENS EXEMPTING CERTAIN

CLASSES OF INJURED INDIVIDUALS.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:46.071 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE BURN IT MIGHT PUT

00:31:42.968 --> 00:31:48.140 region:rollup2
ON THEM UNFAIRLY INCREASES THE.

00:31:46.071 --> 00:31:49.741 region:rollup2
BURDEN ON THE OTHERS THEM

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:52.010 region:rollup2

THAT IN IN THE INSTANCE OF OF

THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE YOU

THE DAMAGE WAS DONE SO I WOULD

MISS RUBIO FURTHER A CO

00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:13.892 region:rollup2
AUTHORING LESS LEGISLATION AND

00:38:11.923 --> 00:38:15.059 region:rollup2
HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS THE FASTEST

00:38:13.892 --> 00:38:16.594 region:rollup2
GROWING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:17.896 region:rollup2

AMERICAN RESIDENTS AND.

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:36.648 region:rollup2
I THINK CALIFORNIA ACCORDING TO

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:38.683 region:rollup2
THE FBI HAS THREE OF THE FBI'S

00:38:36.648 --> 00:38:40.318 region:rollup2
TOP TEN HOT SPOTS FOR HUMAN

00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:41.452 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKING VERTICAL PROSECUTION

00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:42.887 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE ONE OF THE

00:38:41.452 --> 00:38:44.556 region:rollup2
MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:45.557 region:rollup2
COMBATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING. BY

00:38:44.556 --> 00:38:46.658 region:rollup2
FULLY PROCESS BY FULLY

00:38:45.557 --> 00:38:48.359 region:rollup2
PROSECUTING THE CASES OF THE

00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:49.928 region:rollup2
TRAFFICKERS.

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:52.063 region:rollup2
AND IT'S PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL

00:38:49.928 --> 00:38:52.964 region:rollup2
FOR TWO REASONS ONE THE DISTRICT

00:38:52.063 --> 00:38:55.099 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS GET BETTER AT THE

00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:57.001 region:rollup2
CASES THEY'RE VERY VERY COMPLEX

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:58.236 region:rollup2
CASES TYPICALLY BECAUSE THE

00:38:57.001 --> 00:38:59.771 region:rollup2
WITNESSES BEEN. DRAMATIC

00:38:58.236 --> 00:39:01.272 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE THEY HAVE.

00:38:59.771 --> 00:39:02.473 region:rollup2
SIMILAR PROFILES TO THOSE

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:03.875 region:rollup2

00:39:02.473 --> 00:39:05.009 region:rollup2
SUFFERING FROM DOMESTIC

00:39:03.875 --> 00:39:06.678 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE ABUSE WITH RESPECT TO

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:08.046 region:rollup2
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THEM TO

00:39:06.678 --> 00:39:09.614 region:rollup2
COOPERATE WITH THE PROSECUTION

00:39:08.046 --> 00:39:10.815 region:rollup2
AND THIS ALLOWS IDEAS TO GET

00:39:09.614 --> 00:39:12.217 region:rollup2
BETTER AT THE CASES BUT MOST

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:13.685 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY IT'S A VICTIM

00:39:12.217 --> 00:39:15.086 region:rollup2
CENTERED APPROACH TO PROSECUTING

00:39:13.685 --> 00:39:16.421 region:rollup2
THE CASES.

00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:17.922 region:rollup2
A VICTIM DOESN'T HAVE TO MEET A

00:39:16.421 --> 00:39:19.023 region:rollup2
NEW PROSECUTOR AT EACH STAGE OF

00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:20.758 region:rollup2

JUSTICE TO BE SERVED AND THIS

00:39:30.802 --> 00:39:33.137 region:rollup2
IS FOUND TO BE ONE OF THE MOST

00:39:31.836 --> 00:39:34.038 region:rollup2

UNDER THIS BILL WHICH DOES NOT

00:57:38.055 --> 00:57:41.391 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT UNDER THIS BILL AND

00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:43.093 region:rollup2
A POLICE OFFICER CONVICTED OF

00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:44.328 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COULD PETITION

00:57:43.093 --> 00:57:45.162 region:rollup2
TO GET THEIR GONE BACK THEY

00:57:44.328 --> 00:57:47.764 region:rollup2
DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WAIT TEN

00:57:45.162 --> 00:57:50.233 region:rollup2
YEARS. BUT A CIVILIAN WOULD HAVE

00:57:47.764 --> 00:57:52.869 region:rollup2
A LIFETIME BAN AND THE SPAN IS

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:55.172 region:rollup2

INCARCERATED FOR A FELONY.

00:58:04.047 --> 00:58:07.284 region:rollup2
AND THIS WILL CERTAINLY HAVE

00:58:05.816 --> 00:58:09.186 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATE HARMON ON

00:58:07.284 --> 00:58:10.620 region:rollup2

TEN YEARS ATTEND YOUR BAND IS

00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:43.653 region:rollup2

DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT. ARMED AND

00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:09.913 region:rollup2

01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:25.935 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LYING TO FEDERAL

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.137 region:rollup2

01:03:25.935 --> 01:03:29.005 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:30.473 region:rollup2
HERE IS A POLICY COMMITTEE.

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:32.342 region:rollup2
THAT WE REALLY DO NEED TO THINK

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:34.978 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHERE CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY

01:03:32.342 --> 01:03:36.713 region:rollup2
IS WHERE THE FEDERAL LAW IS.

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:39.382 region:rollup2
AND ALIGNING.

A RESTRAINING ORDER BUT I'M SURE

01:04:00.637 --> 01:04:04.007 region:rollup2
AS SOON AS A RESTRAINING ORDER

OWNING GUNS BUT IN THIS CASE

IMPORTANT.

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:21.050 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DOESN'T SEE

01:05:57.654 --> 01:06:00.156 region:rollup2
JUST THIS DISCUSSION HAD NOT

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:03.059 region:rollup2
DEVOLVE INTO.

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:04.194 region:rollup2
BEING.

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:06.296 region:rollup2
PREJUDICE TOWARD DOMESTIC

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:07.864 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE VICTIMS I DON'T THINK

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:09.399 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE INTENT.

01:06:07.864 --> 01:06:11.134 region:rollup2
OF THE OPPOSITION.

01:06:09.399 --> 01:06:13.369 region:rollup2
.

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:16.239 region:rollup2
SO.

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:17.640 region:rollup2
AT SOMEONE.

01:06:16.239 --> 01:06:19.576 region:rollup2
WHO'S BEEN PART OF THE

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:21.744 region:rollup2
VICTIMIZED VIOLENT WHO GREW UP

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:22.812 region:rollup2

ONE YEARS OLD.

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:27.217 region:rollup2
IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER

01:06:25.682 --> 01:06:29.953 region:rollup2

HAPPEN IN MY FAMILY LOW SEVEN.

01:06:32.956 --> 01:06:37.093 region:rollup2
IT WAS BECAUSE ALCOHOL IS.

01:06:35.792 --> 01:06:38.428 region:rollup2
AND UNTIL.

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:41.497 region:rollup2
THEY GOT TREATMENT.

01:06:38.428 --> 01:06:44.167 region:rollup2
AND UNTIL.

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:45.001 region:rollup2
MY FATHER AND STEPFATHER.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.135 region:rollup2
LEARN THAT WHAT THEY WERE DOING

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:48.171 region:rollup2
WAS ROUGH.

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:50.373 region:rollup2
DO.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:53.009 region:rollup2
I HAVE IMAGES IN MY HEAD. THAT'S

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:55.645 region:rollup2
MY HEAD EVERYDAY.

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:57.313 region:rollup2
EVERY DAY THAT I CAN'T GET OUT.

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:59.048 region:rollup2
WHEN PEOPLE ASK YOU WHY AM I SO

01:06:57.313 --> 01:07:00.850 region:rollup2
CLOSE TO MY MOTHER. BECAUSE WE

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:03.519 region:rollup2
WENT TO AT HELD TOGETHER.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:06.456 region:rollup2
SO.

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:07.290 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE. NOT ONLY.

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:08.324 region:rollup2
WE'LL DO WHATEVER WE CAN

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:10.927 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:12.028 region:rollup2
VICTIMS.

01:07:10.927 --> 01:07:14.964 region:rollup2
WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE WINNER

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:17.834 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THOSE TWO BLACK MEN.

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:18.368 region:rollup2
MY FATHER AND STEPFATHER.

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:19.936 region:rollup2
ARE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:20.970 region:rollup2
EITHER.

01:07:19.936 --> 01:07:21.537 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:23.306 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DID CHANGE YOUR

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:24.207 region:rollup2
LIFE.

01:07:23.306 --> 01:07:26.075 region:rollup2
THEY DID BECOME RESPECTABLE

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:27.310 region:rollup2
MEMBERS

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:28.878 region:rollup2
SOCIETY DATE DID GO TO CHURCH

01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:32.749 region:rollup2
EVERY DAY.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:33.550 region:rollup2
THEY DID STOP DOING THAT.

01:07:32.749 --> 01:07:35.618 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:37.620 region:rollup2
IS LET'S.

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:38.655 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE ONE.

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:40.256 region:rollup2
WE DON'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:41.858 region:rollup2
EITHER ONE.

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:43.526 region:rollup2
I WOULD PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:07:41.858 --> 01:07:44.861 region:rollup2
TO FOR ME AND I'VE SAID THIS A

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:45.261 region:rollup2
MILLION TIMES

01:07:44.861 --> 01:07:47.163 region:rollup2
FOR ME IT'S ABOUT

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:48.398 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION.

01:07:47.163 --> 01:07:52.001 region:rollup2
AND SO AS I SPOKE TO YOU.

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:53.870 region:rollup2
IT'S ON THE BOOKS.

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:55.305 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW TAKING CARE OF IT

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:57.240 region:rollup2
AND SO MIKE MIKE MIKE QUESTION

01:07:55.305 --> 01:07:59.208 region:rollup2
MORE.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:01.611 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:02.545 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S SOME SOME HOLES IN

01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:03.580 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE NOT

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:05.582 region:rollup2
BANNING.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:06.849 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:08.484 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE COMMITTED DOMESTIC

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:09.953 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE IF THE NUMBERS ARE

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:12.388 region:rollup2
GOING UP BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:08:09.953 --> 01:08:14.157 region:rollup2
IT ON THE BOOKS IN CALIFORNIA?

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:16.025 region:rollup2
ON THAT DAY THAT'S.

01:08:14.157 --> 01:08:17.860 region:rollup2
MY CONCERN TO MAKING SURE THAT

01:08:16.025 --> 01:08:18.061 region:rollup2
WE CAN IMPLEMENT THIS IN A WAY

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.762 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:08:18.061 --> 01:08:21.431 region:rollup2
.

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:22.365 region:rollup2
IT'LL BE MOST.

01:08:21.431 --> 01:08:23.800 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE AND HAVE THE MOST

01:08:22.365 --> 01:08:26.636 region:rollup2
IMPACT

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:29.639 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE DO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:30.840 region:rollup2
GUNS DO NOT GET IN THE HANDS OF

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:33.309 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE VIOLENT.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.677 region:rollup2
PERIOD.

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:35.244 region:rollup2
I DON'T CARE IF DOMESTIC I'LL

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:37.313 region:rollup2
GIVE THE HATE CRIME I HAD A

01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:39.349 region:rollup2
BILL.

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:40.783 region:rollup2
BANNING HATE CRIMES.

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:42.719 region:rollup2
ON MISDEMEANOR HATE CRIME

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:44.320 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS FROM OWNING GUNS FOR

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:45.088 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS I WANT TO MAKE A

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.990 region:rollup2
LIFETIME BAN.

01:08:45.088 --> 01:08:49.158 region:rollup2
SO I.

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:50.827 region:rollup2
I GET IT I'M WITH YOU.

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:52.495 region:rollup2
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE

01:08:50.827 --> 01:08:54.864 region:rollup2
THAT'LL GET WE IMPLEMENTED.

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:56.199 region:rollup2
THAT WE JUST DON'T MAKE LOS.

01:08:54.864 --> 01:08:58.034 region:rollup2
I BET ON THE OTHER SIDE ON

01:08:56.199 --> 01:09:02.271 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION WE MAKE LAWS AND

01:08:58.034 --> 01:09:04.207 region:rollup2
THEN IT'S EITHER NEVER REALLY.

01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:06.075 region:rollup2
LET ACTUATED IN A IN A WAY THAT

01:09:04.207 --> 01:09:08.911 region:rollup2
WE FULLY HELPS.

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:11.114 region:rollup2
OR IT'S DONE INCORRECTLY AND IT

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:12.548 region:rollup2
CAUSES MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

01:09:11.114 --> 01:09:14.751 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S WHEREWE'RE AT

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:15.385 region:rollup2

WHAT?

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.997 region:rollup2
WHATEVER WAY WE NEED TO MAKE

01:09:26.396 --> 01:09:29.632 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THIS FOLLOWS ALONG

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:31.267 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW THAT THERE ARE NO

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:33.269 region:rollup2

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:34.437 region:rollup2
IN A CRACK THAT IT DOES. WORK

01:09:34.437 --> 01:09:38.474 region:rollup2
FIREARMS THAT WE DO GO AFTER.

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:40.476 region:rollup2
AND IF WE HAVE TO RETRIEVE GUNS

01:09:38.474 --> 01:09:42.211 region:rollup2
FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE. DOMESTIC

01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:45.481 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE ABUSERS THAT WERE ABLE

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:47.150 region:rollup2

01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:54.390 region:rollup2

AND I'M I'M.

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:58.895 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT IF IF

01:09:56.793 --> 01:10:01.531 region:rollup2
WE WORK TOGETHER TO GET TO THAT.

01:09:58.895 --> 01:10:03.766 region:rollup2

UNDERSTAND.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:16.412 region:rollup2
I'M NOT VOTING BECAUSE I THINK

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:17.213 region:rollup2
WE WERE.

01:10:16.412 --> 01:10:18.514 region:rollup2
WE ALSO GOT I THINK OF THIS AND

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:20.917 region:rollup2
THAT AND A SYSTEMATIC LOGICAL

01:10:18.514 --> 01:10:21.384 region:rollup2
WAY.

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:22.885 region:rollup2

POSSESSION OF A FIREARM BY A

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:14.617 region:rollup2

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:18.521 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH DISCUSSION

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:20.423 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:22.692 region:rollup2
GUN VIOLENCE AND THE SENSELESS

01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:24.994 region:rollup2
LOSS OF OF LIVES.

01:14:22.692 --> 01:14:27.196 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:29.999 region:rollup2
WHAT WE CAN? I MEAN WE WANT TO

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:31.901 region:rollup2
HAVE THE POWER TO STOP THAT AND.

01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:33.936 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS IS ONE STEP ONE

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:35.738 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STEP IS TAKING THE

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:37.606 region:rollup2
FIREARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF

01:14:35.738 --> 01:14:39.709 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM.

01:14:37.606 --> 01:14:42.044 region:rollup2
.

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:43.546 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THIS BILL DO IT IT IT?

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:45.881 region:rollup2
IT ADDRESSES TWO CRITICAL

01:14:43.546 --> 01:14:46.882 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS ONE IS INCREASING THE

01:14:45.881 --> 01:14:48.751 region:rollup2
TRIAD.

01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:51.053 region:rollup2
IF THE DEFENDANT IS GETTING

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:51.721 region:rollup2
SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR GUN

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:53.022 region:rollup2
POSSESSION.

01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:53.723 region:rollup2
AND WHEN I SAY POSSESSION I

01:14:53.022 --> 01:14:56.359 region:rollup2
MEAN.

01:14:53.723 --> 01:14:58.561 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION AND

01:14:56.359 --> 01:15:00.396 region:rollup2
ACTUAL POSSESSION BOTH OF WHICH

01:14:58.561 --> 01:15:01.397 region:rollup2
REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE GUN

01:15:00.396 --> 01:15:04.900 region:rollup2
IS PRESENT.

01:15:01.397 --> 01:15:07.336 region:rollup2
.

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:08.838 region:rollup2
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT.

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:10.573 region:rollup2
WILL MAY BE ALMOST ALL OF US

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:13.275 region:rollup2
COULD AGREE THAT SOMEONE HAS

01:15:10.573 --> 01:15:15.277 region:rollup2
BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY.

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:17.546 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T POSSESS FIREARMS.

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:19.515 region:rollup2
MAYBE I'M. I'M LOW OFF ON THAT

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:21.450 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK I THINK THAT'S THAT

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:23.386 region:rollup2
THE VIEW OF MOST CALIFORNIANS.

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:24.320 region:rollup2
AND IN PEOPLE THAT ARE CAUGHT

01:15:23.386 --> 01:15:25.287 region:rollup2
WITH FIREARMS THAT SHOULDN'T

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.390 region:rollup2
HAVE THEM NEED TO BE HELD

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:29.325 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE HOW DO WE SEND THAT

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:30.659 region:rollup2
MESSAGE AND AND KEEP OUR STREETS

01:15:29.325 --> 01:15:32.028 region:rollup2
SAFE.

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:33.929 region:rollup2
ONE WAY TO HOLD THEM

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:35.564 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE IS GIVING THAT POWER

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:37.299 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE JUDGES GIVING THE

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:39.935 region:rollup2
JUDGES THE DISCRETION.

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:40.936 region:rollup2
TO AND THE LATITUDE TIP

01:15:39.935 --> 01:15:42.905 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY SENDS THAT

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:43.639 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:45.975 region:rollup2
GUN DOES.

01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:47.610 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T REQUIRING A

01:15:45.975 --> 01:15:50.246 region:rollup2
MANDATORY PRISON SENTENCE.

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:52.715 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH I WOULD SUPPORT THAT.

01:15:50.246 --> 01:15:53.916 region:rollup2
BUT I DO THINK THAT.

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:56.352 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW JUDGES HOW

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:58.854 region:rollup2
THE LATITUDES ON ONE END OF THE

01:15:56.352 --> 01:16:00.322 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM TO. PROPERLY SENTENCE A

01:15:58.854 --> 01:16:01.891 region:rollup2
DEFENDANT THAT'S THAT'S CAUGHT

01:16:00.322 --> 01:16:03.225 region:rollup2
WITH A FIREARM AND HAS BEEN

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:05.161 region:rollup2
CONVICTED OF A FELONY.

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:07.563 region:rollup2
AND THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:08.931 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE GETTING NO JAIL TIME

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:11.467 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GETTING PROBATION

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:14.703 region:rollup2
SENTENCES THE ACTUAL PRISON

01:16:11.467 --> 01:16:16.238 region:rollup2
SENTENCES ARE. I WOULD SAY RARE

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:18.674 region:rollup2
IN IN MY COUNTY.

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:19.909 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:21.710 region:rollup2
I I DO A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:23.646 region:rollup2
I FOUND THAT A DEFENDANT THAT

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:26.082 region:rollup2
WAS JUST SENTENCED IN JANUARY HE

01:16:23.646 --> 01:16:27.683 region:rollup2
HAD FIVE PRIOR FELONIES.

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:29.385 region:rollup2
AND HE WAS CAUGHT WITH A LOADED

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:31.353 region:rollup2
FIREAM UNDER THE SEAT OF HIS

01:16:29.385 --> 01:16:34.056 region:rollup2
VEHICLE HE HAD A GUN HOLSTER.

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:40.696 region:rollup2
.

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:43.699 region:rollup2
TAPED HE HAD METHAMPHETAMINE

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:45.067 region:rollup2
ANNEMASSE PIPE ON HIS PERSON AND

01:16:43.699 --> 01:16:47.036 region:rollup2
A NINE YEAR OLD SON IN THE

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:48.971 region:rollup2
BACKSEAT.

01:16:47.036 --> 01:16:51.407 region:rollup2
AND FIVE PRIOR FELONIES.

01:16:48.971 --> 01:16:52.675 region:rollup2
AND HE RECEIVED PROBATION AND A

01:16:51.407 --> 01:16:55.211 region:rollup2
SIX MONTH JAIL SENTENCE

01:16:52.675 --> 01:16:56.679 region:rollup2
SO.

01:16:55.211 --> 01:16:57.980 region:rollup2
THAT END OF THE SPECTRUM IS

01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:59.315 region:rollup2
COVERED IT'S COVERED IN MY

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.249 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:01.784 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT IF YOU HAVE.

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:03.652 region:rollup2
.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:04.587 region:rollup2
YOU NO ANOTHER EXAMPLE MIGHT BE

01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:06.822 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY THAT HAS.

01:17:04.587 --> 01:17:09.525 region:rollup2
A REALLY OLD CONVICTION A

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:11.260 region:rollup2
FELONY FOR COCAINE POSSESSION.

01:17:09.525 --> 01:17:13.162 region:rollup2
AND THAT PERSON IS CAUGHT WITH A

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:14.897 region:rollup2
FIREARM IN NAY HAVE NO CRIMINAL

01:17:13.162 --> 01:17:16.699 region:rollup2
RECORD BETWEEN THAT CONVICTION

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:18.667 region:rollup2
IN THE EIGHTIES OF THE COCAINE

01:17:16.699 --> 01:17:19.735 region:rollup2
POSSESSION AND NOW THEY'RE

01:17:18.667 --> 01:17:21.070 region:rollup2
CAUGHT WITH A FIREARM. MEAN THE

01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:21.904 region:rollup2
JUDGE HAS THE DISCRETION TO

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:23.572 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY SENTENCED THAT

01:17:21.904 --> 01:17:25.207 region:rollup2
PERSON.

01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:26.775 region:rollup2
BUT NOW AT THE OTHER END OF THE

01:17:25.207 --> 01:17:29.445 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM HOW ABOUT THE VIOLENT

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:31.680 region:rollup2
FELONS THAT WAS CONVICTED OF YOU

01:17:29.445 --> 01:17:34.049 region:rollup2
KNOW DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:36.785 region:rollup2
IS REPEATEDLY CAUGHT WITH A

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:38.654 region:rollup2
FIREARM AGAIN AND AGAIN THE MOST

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:41.223 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON CAN GET IS THREE

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:42.858 region:rollup2
YEARS OF OF STATE PRESENT AND

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:43.993 region:rollup2
NOT A SERVICE FIFTY PERCENT SO

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:45.494 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EIGHTEEN

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:46.795 region:rollup2
MONTHS.

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:47.930 region:rollup2
AN EIGHTEEN MONTH SENTENCE IS

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:48.831 region:rollup2
THE MOST THAT THAT PERSON CAN

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:50.599 region:rollup2
GET.

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:52.568 region:rollup2
.

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:54.403 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

01:17:52.568 --> 01:17:56.272 region:rollup2
PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY ANOTHER

01:17:54.403 --> 01:17:57.773 region:rollup2
WAY THIS BILL DOES IT. TALKING

01:17:56.272 --> 01:18:00.976 region:rollup2
ABOUT MISDEMEANORS PEOPLE THAT

01:17:57.773 --> 01:18:02.411 region:rollup2
MIS USE WEAPONS MISUSE FIREARMS

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:03.779 region:rollup2
AT THE MISDEMEANOR LEVEL

01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:04.914 region:rollup2
SHOOTING AT AN INHABITED

01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:06.649 region:rollup2
DWELLING.

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:08.651 region:rollup2
ASSAULT OR BRANDISHING A

01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:09.952 region:rollup2
FIREARM IN THE PRESENCE OF A

01:18:08.651 --> 01:18:11.887 region:rollup2
POLICE OFFICER.

01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:14.056 region:rollup2
THOSE OUR MISDEMEANORS WHERE

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:15.658 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:17.159 region:rollup2
JUST HAVE THE TEN YEAR BAN.

01:18:15.658 --> 01:18:18.727 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:19.028 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ADDITION THAT THIS

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:20.062 region:rollup2
BILL BRINGS.

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:22.531 region:rollup2
.

01:18:20.062 --> 01:18:23.399 region:rollup2
FOR PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:25.668 region:rollup2
SO PEOPLE.

01:18:23.399 --> 01:18:26.168 region:rollup2
ENCLOSING PEOPLE THAT HAVE

01:18:25.668 --> 01:18:27.770 region:rollup2
COMMITTED FELONIES THEY

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:29.171 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T. THAT YOU KNOW THAT IF

01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:30.573 region:rollup2
SHOT IN PEOPLE'S HOMES HAVE

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:33.208 region:rollup2
BRANDISHED FIREARMS AROUND

01:18:30.573 --> 01:18:35.044 region:rollup2
POLICE SHOULDN'T BE PERMITTED TO

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:36.946 region:rollup2
EVER HAVE A FIREARM PUBLIC

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:38.347 region:rollup2
SAFETY DEMANDS THIS SO IF WE

01:18:36.946 --> 01:18:39.848 region:rollup2
WANT TO TALK ABOUT REDUCING. GUN

01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:42.184 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE.

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:43.485 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO GIVE THAT

01:18:42.184 --> 01:18:45.521 region:rollup2
THE JUDGE HAS THE DISCRETION TO

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:50.793 region:rollup2
KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE AND I

AND.

01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:14.710 region:rollup2
THERE IS ALREADY ADEQUATE

SENTENCING DISCRETION TO.

01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:20.716 region:rollup2

DON'T WANT TO BE PUNISHED.

01:20:22.117 --> 01:20:23.552 region:rollup2
BUT OF SOMETIMES I FEEL THAT

01:20:23.352 --> 01:20:26.722 region:rollup2
WAY.

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:28.724 region:rollup2
FIRST UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION

TIME THEY'VE BEEN TO STATE

01:20:35.097 --> 01:20:37.1000 region:rollup2
PRISON IF THEY'VE BEEN CHARGED

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:40.436 region:rollup2
WITH A FELONY.

01:20:37.1000 --> 01:20:43.005 region:rollup2
TWO IF THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN ARE

VIOLENT FELONY SUCH AS A

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:48.677 region:rollup2
ROBBERY.

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:51.013 region:rollup2
IT IS A STRIKE AND THEY CAN BE

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:53.182 region:rollup2
THAT THE NEW FELONY THE BASE

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:55.884 region:rollup2
TERM CAN BE DOUBLED SO. INSTEAD

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:59.154 region:rollup2
OF SIXTEEN TWO THREE IT COULD BE

01:20:55.884 --> 01:21:01.457 region:rollup2
DOUBLED TO. US SIX YEARS BY THE

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:04.460 region:rollup2
JUDGE SO GOOD. AND THE DISTRICT

01:21:01.457 --> 01:21:04.860 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY CHARGES THE STRIKE

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:07.663 region:rollup2
THE JUDGE CANNOT.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:08.630 region:rollup2
DISMISS THE STRIKE OUT OF HAND

01:21:07.663 --> 01:21:11.900 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE PROSECUTION'S

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:13.836 region:rollup2
COOPERATION AND THREE ARM UNDER

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:15.871 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL SYSTEM THERE'S

01:21:13.836 --> 01:21:18.040 region:rollup2
TRIGGER LOCK FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:20.476 region:rollup2
VIOLENT FELONIES AND THEN ARE.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:22.644 region:rollup2
FOUND IN POSSESSION OF GUNS AND

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:24.613 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BE GIVEN LIFE SENTENCES

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:27.616 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S ALREADY ADEQUATE

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:29.685 region:rollup2
DISCRETION ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:32.254 region:rollup2
ON THIS IS NOT.

01:21:29.685 --> 01:21:34.390 region:rollup2
I THINK WE HAVE FOUND THAT WE

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:37.626 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED AS AND AS A

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:39.595 region:rollup2

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:41.997 region:rollup2
TRY TO LOCK PEOPLE UP TO SOLVE

01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:45.968 region:rollup2
OUR PROBLEMS ALL WE HAVE BEEN A

01:21:41.997 --> 01:21:49.004 region:rollup2
CREATED IS MASS INCARCERATION. A

POSSESSING GUNS ILLEGALLY

01:25:05.367 --> 01:25:08.070 region:rollup2
INCARCERATED LONGER WOULD

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:09.838 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY LEAD TO.

01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:11.173 region:rollup2
ANY REDUCTION IN GUN VIOLENCE

01:25:09.838 --> 01:25:13.275 region:rollup2

WITH ME WHAT THE DEFINITION OF

POSSESSION IS.

01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:31.460 region:rollup2
FOR THIS BILL AS WELL I THINK

01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:36.498 region:rollup2
KNOWING POSSESSION THERE'S ALSO

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:37.432 region:rollup2
SOMETHING CALLED CONSTRUCTIVE

01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:39.701 region:rollup2
POSSESSION.

01:25:37.432 --> 01:25:41.370 region:rollup2
BUT BOTH REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE OF

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:42.571 region:rollup2
THE FIREARMS PRESENTS SO.

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:44.740 region:rollup2

VEHICLE.

01:25:48.644 --> 01:25:51.480 region:rollup2

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.689 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:25:58.787 --> 01:26:02.691 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I REVIEW THOSE CASES

01:26:00.689 --> 01:26:04.926 region:rollup2
ALL THE TIME THAT THE FIREARM

01:26:02.691 --> 01:26:06.528 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN THE CENTER CONSOLE.

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:08.230 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S FOUR OCCUPANTS OF

01:26:06.528 --> 01:26:10.899 region:rollup2
THE VEHICLE THOSE CASES ARE

01:26:08.230 --> 01:26:12.300 region:rollup2

DON'T GET FILED AT ALL THEY'RE

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:20.876 region:rollup2
NOT GETTING FILED BY ME.

01:26:18.807 --> 01:26:22.644 region:rollup2
IF I'M GONNA NEED D. N. A. OR

01:26:20.876 --> 01:26:24.079 region:rollup2
FINGERPRINTS ON THAT FIREARM OR

01:26:22.644 --> 01:26:25.881 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA NEED AN OFFICER TO SEE

01:26:24.079 --> 01:26:27.749 region:rollup2
SOME FURTIVE MOVEMENT BY A

01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:29.651 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL WHERE YOU

01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:31.353 region:rollup2
KNOW. PUTTING THE THE.

01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:34.189 region:rollup2
FIREARM PERHAPS UNDERNEATH THE

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:35.690 region:rollup2
SEAT BUT SIMPLY A FIREARM WITH

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:40.295 region:rollup2
FOUR PEOPLE AROUND IT.

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:42.130 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE CASE THAT I'VE I

01:26:40.295 --> 01:26:43.432 region:rollup2
FEEL ETHICALLY THAT I COMPILE.

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:44.866 region:rollup2
THEN YOU SHOULD BE HOW DID YOU

01:26:43.432 --> 01:26:46.201 region:rollup2
WE NEED YOU IN MY HEART THAT IT

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:47.135 region:rollup2

COURT ROOMS.

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:51.339 region:rollup2
I GUESS MY SECOND QUESTION HAS

01:26:49.071 --> 01:26:53.742 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH ENFORCEMENT.

01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:56.378 region:rollup2
OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL.

01:26:53.742 --> 01:26:58.146 region:rollup2
ARE THERE WAYS TO GUARANTEE

01:26:56.378 --> 01:27:00.048 region:rollup2
CONSISTENCY OF ENFORCEMENT.

01:26:58.146 --> 01:27:01.450 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE ACROSS ALL

COUNTIES.

01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:03.952 region:rollup2
I THINK THE WAY THAT YOU WOULD

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:06.388 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DO THAT IS TO MAKE A

01:27:03.952 --> 01:27:08.023 region:rollup2
MANDATORY SENTENCE IT ON THIS ON

01:27:06.388 --> 01:27:09.624 region:rollup2
THE BOOKS WHICH I THINK.

01:27:08.023 --> 01:27:11.093 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW EVERYBODY FEELS A

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:12.260 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH

01:27:11.093 --> 01:27:12.794 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IT REALLY THE

STRIKES FROM A COMPLAINER

01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:25.674 region:rollup2

A LOT WE CAN BE DOING TO KEEP

01:28:28.170 --> 01:28:31.439 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITY SAFE FOR AND

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:32.941 region:rollup2
PROVIDING MORE OPPORTUNITY. OF

AWAY FROM THE GUNS.

01:28:53.195 --> 01:28:56.565 region:rollup2
THE REASON WHY APPREHENSION.

01:28:55.297 --> 01:28:58.300 region:rollup2
IS WHAT WORKS IS BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:28:56.565 --> 01:28:59.467 region:rollup2

01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.869 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT USING THE GUNS YOU'RE

THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO

01:29:02.604 --> 01:29:06.908 region:rollup2

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:29.064 region:rollup2
SO.

01:29:27.529 --> 01:29:31.032 region:rollup2

FOR ME AS CHAIR.

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:36.338 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT JUDGES.

01:29:33.902 --> 01:29:38.273 region:rollup2
AND SMART DE A.

01:29:36.338 --> 01:29:40.542 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS AND

01:29:38.273 --> 01:29:42.377 region:rollup2
HAD ENHANCEMENTS ANYWAY.

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:43.578 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT FOR ME THAT'S

01:29:42.377 --> 01:29:45.914 region:rollup2
MORE THE ARGUMENT THEN WHAT ARE

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:47.082 region:rollup2
NOT PUTTING SOMEONE IN.

01:29:45.914 --> 01:29:47.983 region:rollup2
FOR TWO YEARS TO SIX YEARS OR

01:29:47.082 --> 01:29:51.052 region:rollup2
WHATEVER.

01:29:47.983 --> 01:29:53.455 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN DEBATE THAT ALL DAY

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:56.191 region:rollup2
WE DO ALL THE RESEARCH AND WE WE

01:29:53.455 --> 01:29:57.659 region:rollup2
CAN FIGHT THAT ANOTHER TIME. BUT

01:29:56.191 --> 01:30:00.228 region:rollup2
FOR ME JUST JUST PHYLLIS NOT

01:29:57.659 --> 01:30:01.129 region:rollup2
PHILOSOPHY JUST ME AS. A SOMEONE

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:02.831 region:rollup2
I WANT TO MAKE SURE.

01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:04.466 region:rollup2
WHAT IMPLEMENTING THE LAWS WE

01:30:02.831 --> 01:30:06.301 region:rollup2
HAVE ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW?

01:30:04.466 --> 01:30:06.901 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD DOING IT TO THE BEST

01:30:06.301 --> 01:30:09.271 region:rollup2
OF OUR ABILITY.

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:10.872 region:rollup2
THAT'S MORE OF A CONCERN I

01:30:09.271 --> 01:30:12.474 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE JUDGES.

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:14.943 region:rollup2
HAVE THE DISCRETION

01:30:12.474 --> 01:30:16.611 region:rollup2
AS WAS STATED EARLIER TO TO ADD

01:30:14.943 --> 01:30:17.178 region:rollup2
ENHANCEMENTS DID DO YOU HAVE

01:30:16.611 --> 01:30:19.514 region:rollup2
SOME THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE

01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:20.582 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT. AND THAT SADDAM

01:30:19.514 --> 01:30:21.650 region:rollup2
OF.

01:30:20.582 --> 01:30:22.450 region:rollup2
THE ENHANCEMENTS ARE NOT

01:30:21.650 --> 01:30:24.152 region:rollup2
NECESSARY WE DID TALK ABOUT SOME

01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:25.654 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS.

01:30:24.152 --> 01:30:28.523 region:rollup2
BUT THE FORTUNE RAN OUT OF TIME

01:30:25.654 --> 01:30:30.325 region:rollup2
TO TO TO REALLY DEVELOP THAT.

01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:30.859 region:rollup2
SO THE CHURCH RECOMMEND A NO

01:30:30.325 --> 01:30:31.326 region:rollup2
VOTE BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE

01:30:30.859 --> 01:30:33.061 region:rollup2

WHAT WE NEED TO TO TO BE ABLE

01:30:33.662 --> 01:30:37.065 region:rollup2

01:30:36.197 --> 01:30:38.600 region:rollup2
AT ENHANCEMENTS WITH THE

01:30:37.065 --> 01:30:40.568 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL SYSTEM.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.003 region:rollup2
IF NOT MAYBE WE WORK TOGETHER TO

01:30:40.568 --> 01:30:44.039 region:rollup2
COME BACK NEXT YEAR.

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:45.907 region:rollup2
BONTA TO WORK WITH THE JUDICIAL%

REHABILITATED HOW DO WE KEEP.

01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:02.257 region:rollup2

01:31:02.257 --> 01:31:05.860 region:rollup2

01:42:11.292 --> 01:42:15.129 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD I HAD ADDITIONAL

CARRIERS WITHOUT A WARRANT

01:42:17.031 --> 01:42:20.468 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT TO PROTECT THAT

01:42:18.299 --> 01:42:23.037 region:rollup2
INFORMATION. HOME I WOULD ADD

01:42:20.468 --> 01:42:25.740 region:rollup2
THAT WHILE ADAM VARIOUS COURTS

01:42:23.037 --> 01:42:28.142 region:rollup2
HAVE RULED ON PIECES OF CARERS

01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:30.144 region:rollup2
AS THE ANALYSIS FOR THESE CARES

01:42:28.142 --> 01:42:31.545 region:rollup2
BELLS ACTUALLY NOTED THE COURTS

01:42:30.144 --> 01:42:33.347 region:rollup2
HAVE PUNTED ON WHETHER SEARCH OF

01:42:31.545 --> 01:42:35.383 region:rollup2
CARRIERS. CONSTITUTES A FOURTH

01:42:33.347 --> 01:42:37.284 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT SEARCH AND SO IT IS

01:42:35.383 --> 01:42:39.487 region:rollup2
QUITE POSSIBLE THAT COURTS COULD

01:42:37.284 --> 01:42:41.055 region:rollup2
RURAL THAT ANY SEARCH OF CARES

01:42:39.487 --> 01:42:43.024 region:rollup2
BY LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD REQUIRE

01:42:41.055 --> 01:42:44.592 region:rollup2
A WARRANT ADDITIONALLY WHILE THE

01:42:43.024 --> 01:42:46.160 region:rollup2
DOJ'S GUIDELINES REQUIRE LAW

01:42:44.592 --> 01:42:47.862 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT TO GET A WARRANT.

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.497 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE ACCESSING PATIENT

01:42:47.862 --> 01:42:50.664 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THEY ARE NOT

01:42:49.497 --> 01:42:53.167 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO GET A WARRANT WHEN

ACCESSING PROVIDER INFORMATION

01:42:53.167 --> 01:42:56.270 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A LITTLE CONFUSING

01:42:54.635 --> 01:42:58.005 region:rollup2
SINCE PROVIDER INFORMATION IN

01:42:56.270 --> 01:43:00.441 region:rollup2
ITSELF CONTAINS. PATIENT

01:42:58.005 --> 01:43:02.510 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND SO IT IS A WAY

01:43:00.441 --> 01:43:03.911 region:rollup2
OF ROUNDS GETTING I'M A WARRANT

01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:05.112 region:rollup2
FOR PATIENTS SPECIFIC

01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:07.081 region:rollup2

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:08.616 region:rollup2
PATIENT INFORMATION SO AGAIN FOR

01:43:07.081 --> 01:43:10.384 region:rollup2
THESE REASONS WE REQUEST THAT.

01:43:08.616 --> 01:43:11.218 region:rollup2
THE BILL BE AMENDED TO INCLUDE A

01:43:10.384 --> 01:43:13.888 region:rollup2

OUTLINED WE REMAIN OPPOSED

01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:29.637 region:rollup2
UNLESS SEMANTIC THANK YOU THANK

MEMBERS. CLASS YES.

01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:35.810 region:rollup2
YEAH I'D I CLEARLY ADMIRE WHAT

01:43:34.608 --> 01:43:37.378 region:rollup2
TRYING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED YOUR

01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:38.345 region:rollup2
TO THE SECURITY DATABASE AND I

01:43:37.378 --> 01:43:39.880 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR

01:43:38.345 --> 01:43:42.016 region:rollup2
BRINGING THIS.

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:43.150 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT REMEDY TO THE TABLE

01:43:42.016 --> 01:43:45.086 region:rollup2
BUT I HAVE SOME CONCERN. OVER

01:43:43.150 --> 01:43:47.054 region:rollup2
THE ONE DAY.

01:43:45.086 --> 01:43:48.289 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE.

01:43:47.054 --> 01:43:50.491 region:rollup2
MANY PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE

01:43:48.289 --> 01:43:52.526 region:rollup2
THERE'S QUITE A DISTANCE TEST TO

01:43:50.491 --> 01:43:54.729 region:rollup2
BE TRAVELING NOT EVERYBODY HAS.

01:43:52.526 --> 01:43:57.198 region:rollup2
AS EFFICIENT.

01:43:54.729 --> 01:43:59.400 region:rollup2
WITH ELECTRONICS STILL THE

01:43:57.198 --> 01:44:00.401 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION PADS ARE STILL.

01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.636 region:rollup2
BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE ONE DAY

01:44:00.401 --> 01:44:04.371 region:rollup2
AS A VERY VERY VERY FAST TURN

01:44:02.636 --> 01:44:05.806 region:rollup2
AROUND EVEN IF IT WAS.

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:07.541 region:rollup2
CHANGE OF THREE DAYS IT SEEMS A

01:44:05.806 --> 01:44:08.042 region:rollup2
LITTLE MORE REASONABLE BUT I SEE

01:44:07.541 --> 01:44:09.744 region:rollup2
THAT THE PHYSICIANS ARE

01:44:08.042 --> 01:44:10.578 region:rollup2
OPPOSING.

01:44:09.744 --> 01:44:12.246 region:rollup2
BUT I I JUST HAVE.

01:44:10.578 --> 01:44:13.681 region:rollup2
SOME CONCERNS OVER THE

01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:14.982 region:rollup2
PRAGMATICS OF THIS

01:44:13.681 --> 01:44:16.517 region:rollup2
S. PRESENTATION IF YOU COULD

01:44:14.982 --> 01:44:17.651 region:rollup2
JUST ADDRESS THAT BEFORE.

01:44:16.517 --> 01:44:19.553 region:rollup2
WE WRAP THIS UP BY DEPRECIATE

01:44:17.651 --> 01:44:21.155 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:44:19.553 --> 01:44:23.190 region:rollup2
HOME CURRENTLY THE THAT TIME

01:44:21.155 --> 01:44:24.658 region:rollup2
PERIOD WITHIN WHICH YOU SUBMIT

01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:26.694 region:rollup2
DATA INTO CARE IS A SEVEN DAYS

01:44:24.658 --> 01:44:28.162 region:rollup2
MANY MANY PHARMACIES ARE THEY

01:44:26.694 --> 01:44:30.131 region:rollup2
DOING IT IN MUCH SHORTER PERIODS

01:44:28.162 --> 01:44:31.165 region:rollup2
OF TIME AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY

01:44:30.131 --> 01:44:32.800 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE FORTY NINE OTHER

01:44:31.165 --> 01:44:34.635 region:rollup2
STATES WELL FORTY EIGHT OTHER

01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:35.803 region:rollup2
STATES. FORTY NINE OF US HAVE PD

01:44:34.635 --> 01:44:37.438 region:rollup2
MPS.

01:44:35.803 --> 01:44:39.373 region:rollup2
FORTY FIVE OF THEM ACTUALLY HAVE

01:44:37.438 --> 01:44:41.041 region:rollup2
WITHIN ONE WORKING DAY AS A TIME

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:43.344 region:rollup2
FRAME EXCEPT FOR ONE STATE THAT

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:45.112 region:rollup2
HAS ONLINE REAL TIME. ENTRY.

01:44:43.344 --> 01:44:47.748 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S OKLAHOMA.

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:49.083 region:rollup2
SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S TIME TO

01:44:47.748 --> 01:44:50.951 region:rollup2
TO READ THE PROGRAM UP CHAIRS TO

01:44:49.083 --> 01:44:52.553 region:rollup2
PUT THOSE POSITION AND READY TO

01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:54.555 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD TO ACCEPT THE DATA

01:44:52.553 --> 01:44:55.856 region:rollup2
AS IT COMES AND. MANY OF THOSE

01:44:54.555 --> 01:44:57.958 region:rollup2
ENTITIES IN THE HEALTHCARE

01:44:55.856 --> 01:44:59.693 region:rollup2
MARKET ARM ALRIGHT ALREADY

01:44:57.958 --> 01:45:01.128 region:rollup2
COMPUTERIZED AND PHARMACIES ARE

01:44:59.693 --> 01:45:02.263 region:rollup2
PERHAPS THE MOST COMPUTERIZED

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:03.964 region:rollup2
AND HELP TO HAVE ONLINE

01:45:02.263 --> 01:45:05.132 region:rollup2
ADJUDICATION. BECAUSE OF THE WAY

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:06.734 region:rollup2
THEY BILL FOR THEIR INSURANCE

01:45:05.132 --> 01:45:08.502 region:rollup2
COMPANIES SO WE THINK THAT IF

01:45:06.734 --> 01:45:10.638 region:rollup2
THEY CAN DO ONLINE ADJUDICATION

01:45:08.502 --> 01:45:11.939 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO PAYMENT THEY

THIRTY ONE IS SO CRITICAL.

01:55:02.763 --> 01:55:05.098 region:rollup2
IT WOULD PLACE THE QUESTION OF

01:55:03.864 --> 01:55:06.533 region:rollup2
WHETHER TO ACQUIRE MILITARY

01:55:05.098 --> 01:55:07.534 region:rollup2

01:55:09.803 --> 01:55:12.205 region:rollup2
IT WOULD PERMIT THESE OFFICIALS

01:55:10.804 --> 01:55:14.141 region:rollup2
TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE COST OF

01:55:12.205 --> 01:55:15.509 region:rollup2
ACQUIRING USING AND MAINTAINING

MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS TRULY

01:55:15.509 --> 01:55:18.879 region:rollup2
WARRANTED. IT WOULD REQUIRE

01:55:17.444 --> 01:55:20.514 region:rollup2
AGENCIES TO CONSIDER AND WORK TO

01:55:18.879 --> 01:55:22.048 region:rollup2

01:55:44.471 --> 01:55:47.107 region:rollup2
PLACE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER

01:57:15.562 --> 01:57:19.232 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS OF

01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:20.667 region:rollup2

01:57:19.232 --> 01:57:21.568 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO ACQUIRE

01:57:20.667 --> 01:57:22.836 region:rollup2

EACH TIME YOU ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE

01:57:27.707 --> 01:57:30.510 region:rollup2

FIRST TIME YOU HAVE TO GO

01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:32.345 region:rollup2

HELICOPTER OR AIRPLANE.

01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:43.156 region:rollup2
IN TWO TO IMPOSE THAT ON LAW

01:57:42.522 --> 01:57:43.556 region:rollup2

01:57:43.156 --> 01:57:45.525 region:rollup2

01:57:43.556 --> 01:57:47.561 region:rollup2

I MEAN THERE ARE SOME THINGS ON

01:57:48.929 --> 01:57:51.464 region:rollup2
HERE THAT SOUND SCARIER THAN

01:57:49.996 --> 01:57:53.133 region:rollup2
OTHERS LIKE TRACKED ARMORED

01:57:51.464 --> 01:57:54.434 region:rollup2

THE SAFETY AND BENEFIT OF THE

01:57:57.804 --> 01:57:59.839 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:57:58.538 --> 01:58:01.274 region:rollup2
PROTECTS.

01:57:59.839 --> 01:58:03.877 region:rollup2
THE DEFINITIONS IN THIS BILL ARE

01:58:01.274 --> 01:58:06.413 region:rollup2
VAGUE AT BEST FOR SOME ITEMS.

01:58:03.877 --> 01:58:08.281 region:rollup2
A FIREARM OR A FIREARM ACCESSORY

01:58:06.413 --> 01:58:10.050 region:rollup2
THAT IS DESIGNED TO LAUNCH SMALL

01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:11.718 region:rollup2
EXPLOSIVE PROJECTILES I DON'T

01:58:10.050 --> 01:58:13.286 region:rollup2
KNOW A TON ABOUT GUNS BUT I'M

01:58:11.718 --> 01:58:15.288 region:rollup2
PRETTY SURE THAT QUALIFIES AS

01:58:13.286 --> 01:58:16.723 region:rollup2
THAT EVERY FIREARM.

01:58:15.288 --> 01:58:17.924 region:rollup2
IS INCLUDED IN THAT DEFINITION

01:58:16.723 --> 01:58:18.792 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT FIREARMS DO THEY

01:58:17.924 --> 01:58:20.527 region:rollup2
LAUNCH SMALL EXPLOSIVE

01:58:18.792 --> 01:58:21.695 region:rollup2
PROJECTILES.

01:58:20.527 --> 01:58:22.762 region:rollup2
SO IF THAT'S NOT THE INTENT THAT

01:58:21.695 --> 01:58:24.464 region:rollup2
AT THE VERY LEAST WE NEED TO

01:58:22.762 --> 01:58:26.199 region:rollup2
CLARIFY THAT.

01:58:24.464 --> 01:58:28.668 region:rollup2
THE BILL ALSO IMPLICATES LONG

01:58:26.199 --> 01:58:30.470 region:rollup2
RANGE ACOUSTIC DEVICES.

01:58:28.668 --> 01:58:31.972 region:rollup2
THAT A BULLHORN.

01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:32.439 region:rollup2
THE HERB SO WE CAN ACQUIRE BULL

01:58:31.972 --> 01:58:33.773 region:rollup2
HORNS FROM THE FEDERAL

01:58:32.439 --> 01:58:35.575 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:58:33.773 --> 01:58:36.109 region:rollup2
I AYE IF THAT'S NOT THE INTENT

01:58:35.575 --> 01:58:39.045 region:rollup2
AGAIN THE BILL SHOULD BE

01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:40.347 region:rollup2
pNOT WHAT THIS BILL INTENDS TO

01:58:39.045 --> 01:58:42.415 region:rollup2
COVER THAT IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

01:58:40.347 --> 01:58:43.016 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN THE DRAFTING OF IT

01:58:42.415 --> 01:58:44.618 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE FIXED AT THE VERY

01:58:43.016 --> 01:58:46.019 region:rollup2
LEAST.

01:58:44.618 --> 01:58:48.088 region:rollup2
AND EVEN IS ALL OF THESE

01:58:46.019 --> 01:58:48.688 region:rollup2
LOGISTICAL OR DRAFTING ISSUES

01:58:48.088 --> 01:58:49.789 region:rollup2
ARE CLARIFIED THE BOTTOM LINE

01:58:48.688 --> 01:58:50.890 region:rollup2
IS.

FIRST OF ALL I'D I TAKE.

02:00:17.577 --> 02:00:20.713 region:rollup2
OVER ITS WITH THE FACT THAT I I

02:00:18.912 --> 02:00:22.182 region:rollup2
THINK THAT. THIS KIND OF BILL

02:00:20.713 --> 02:00:23.750 region:rollup2
FEEDS THE TENSION.

02:00:22.182 --> 02:00:25.251 region:rollup2

TRULY WHAT I BELIEVE.

02:00:35.361 --> 02:00:38.898 region:rollup2
AND. I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE

02:00:37.097 --> 02:00:39.365 region:rollup2
THAT WE.

02:00:38.898 --> 02:00:41.234 region:rollup2
TAKE A POSITION THAT.

02:00:39.365 --> 02:00:42.335 region:rollup2
.

02:00:41.234 --> 02:00:45.004 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT EXISTS TO DEFEND

02:00:42.335 --> 02:00:46.840 region:rollup2
A NOT TO ATTACK.

CALLED TERRORISM.

02:00:50.110 --> 02:00:52.612 region:rollup2

THESE KINDS OF ATTACKS.

02:00:54.514 --> 02:00:58.318 region:rollup2
IS RIDICULOUS.

02:00:56.249 --> 02:01:00.186 region:rollup2

02:01:02.155 --> 02:01:05.658 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO.

02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:06.826 region:rollup2
AND. I THINK OF THESE KINDS OF

02:01:05.658 --> 02:01:08.795 region:rollup2
MEASURES.

02:01:40.627 --> 02:01:45.131 region:rollup2
AND THAT THESE TYPES OF TOOLS

02:01:43.496 --> 02:01:47.300 region:rollup2
ARE NECESSARY TO DEFEND.

02:01:45.131 --> 02:01:48.468 region:rollup2
INNOCENT PEOPLE AND SO I I WOULD

02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:50.036 region:rollup2
WISH THAT. WE COULD.

02:01:48.468 --> 02:01:52.272 region:rollup2

I. FIGURES CHAIRMAN I I WILL LE.

02:02:05.418 --> 02:02:07.320 region:rollup2
I THINK THE BILL SPEAKS FOR

02:02:06.219 --> 02:02:08.655 region:rollup2
ITSELF I STILL RESPECT MY

02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:09.222 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE WHO HAS IT PERHAPS A

02:02:08.655 --> 02:02:10.723 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW A

02:02:09.222 --> 02:02:12.258 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCE FOR

02:02:10.723 --> 02:02:13.593 region:rollup2
WHY THIS BILL MAY BE NECESSARY.

02:02:12.258 --> 02:02:15.528 region:rollup2
OF MY TIME ON THE CITY COUNCIL

02:02:13.593 --> 02:02:17.363 region:rollup2
I'M I WOULD WANT THIS AUTHORITY

02:02:15.528 --> 02:02:18.398 region:rollup2
TO BE GIVEN TO ME A TO MAKE THAT

02:02:17.363 --> 02:02:19.732 region:rollup2
DECISION IN A PUBLIC A

02:02:18.398 --> 02:02:20.934 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT MANNER. OUR MAKE

02:02:19.732 --> 02:02:22.435 region:rollup2
PERFECTLY CLEAR THERE IS A

02:02:20.934 --> 02:02:23.670 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION IN THIS BILL THAT

02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:24.103 region:rollup2
WAS NOT IN THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE

02:02:23.670 --> 02:02:25.438 region:rollup2
ORDER.

02:02:24.103 --> 02:02:27.373 region:rollup2
THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE

02:02:25.438 --> 02:02:29.275 region:rollup2
ACQUISITION OF ANY OF THESE

02:02:27.373 --> 02:02:30.443 region:rollup2
KINDS OF PIECES OF EQUIPMENT BUT

02:02:29.275 --> 02:02:31.878 region:rollup2
IT DOES REQUIRE A PUBLIC HEARING

02:02:30.443 --> 02:02:32.745 region:rollup2
FOR IT. AND MUCH AS A SHARE OF

02:02:31.878 --> 02:02:33.980 region:rollup2
HAS TO GO BEFORE THE BOARD OF

02:02:32.745 --> 02:02:35.782 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS TO REQUEST HIS OR

02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:36.549 region:rollup2
HER BUDGET I'M WHICH DOES

02:02:35.782 --> 02:02:38.618 region:rollup2
DICTATE THE NUMBER OF.

THEY MAY HAVE YOU KNOW MONEY IS

02:02:40.753 --> 02:02:43.389 region:rollup2
HOW THOSE THINGS ARE OFTEN

02:02:41.688 --> 02:02:45.124 region:rollup2
PLAYED OUT. A JUSTIFICATION

02:02:43.389 --> 02:02:46.392 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR SOME THE PROCESS I

02:02:45.124 --> 02:02:47.560 region:rollup2
THIS IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY IS

02:02:46.392 --> 02:02:48.494 region:rollup2
NOT ABOUT PROHIBITION IT'S BY

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:50.430 region:rollup2
ASKING PEOPLE WHETHER THEY

02:02:48.494 --> 02:02:51.464 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE THIS EQUIPMENT BY

02:02:50.430 --> 02:02:52.265 region:rollup2
THAN SIMPLY JUST COLLECTING THE

02:02:51.464 --> 02:02:53.666 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT.

02:02:52.265 --> 02:02:54.567 region:rollup2
LOW HAPPY GOING FOR THE DATE

TIME ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND WE

02:02:55.635 --> 02:02:58.705 region:rollup2
CAN CERTAINLY WORK UP TO ADDRESS

02:02:57.370 --> 02:03:00.707 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF.

02:02:58.705 --> 02:03:02.342 region:rollup2
THAT SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS I

02:03:00.707 --> 02:03:03.843 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S A FAIR OBSERVATION

02:03:02.342 --> 02:03:04.978 region:rollup2
UMP IN TERMS OF THE

02:03:03.843 --> 02:03:06.479 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS.

02:03:04.978 --> 02:03:09.515 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE UP PUBLIC HEARING

02:03:06.479 --> 02:03:10.717 region:rollup2
IS WHAT IS TAKING TO CONFIRM A

OUR PUBLIC PROCESS IS WHAT'S

02:03:11.317 --> 02:03:13.720 region:rollup2
TAKEN TO CONFIRM OR APPROPRIATE

02:03:12.185 --> 02:03:15.355 region:rollup2
A BUDGET. ON THIS IS NO

02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:16.389 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ON BUT THIS DOES

02:03:15.355 --> 02:03:18.124 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE PARTS OF PUBLIC

02:03:16.389 --> 02:03:18.758 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION WHICH I THINK IS

02:03:18.124 --> 02:03:19.826 region:rollup2
SO VERY IMPORTANT THIS POINT IN

02:03:18.758 --> 02:03:20.960 region:rollup2
TIME.

02:03:19.826 --> 02:03:22.595 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AFTER THE RECENT

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:24.097 region:rollup2
RECESSION OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER

02:03:22.595 --> 02:03:24.631 region:rollup2

EXPERIENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:03:33.973 --> 02:03:37.610 region:rollup2
ARM. AND AS SOMEONE WHO ALSO

02:03:36.042 --> 02:03:39.612 region:rollup2
WORKED ON LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE

02:03:37.610 --> 02:03:40.680 region:rollup2
DA SIDE I THINK WE DO HAVE JUST

02:03:39.612 --> 02:03:42.181 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENCE OF

02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:43.750 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE AND HOW WE LOOK AT

02:03:42.181 --> 02:03:44.717 region:rollup2
THIS. THAT WE ALL SHARE THE

02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:46.319 region:rollup2
GOALS OF ENSURING THAT OUR

02:03:44.717 --> 02:03:47.220 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE FROM

02:03:46.319 --> 02:03:49.222 region:rollup2
TERRORISM.

02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:50.957 region:rollup2
BUT IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES

02:03:49.222 --> 02:03:53.393 region:rollup2
THERE SIGNIFICANT DISTRUST

02:03:50.957 --> 02:03:54.927 region:rollup2
BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE AND

02:03:53.393 --> 02:03:56.863 region:rollup2
OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES FOR A

02:03:54.927 --> 02:03:58.931 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF REASONS AND. ARE I

02:03:56.863 --> 02:04:00.667 region:rollup2
WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE TENSION

02:03:58.931 --> 02:04:02.602 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK YOU ALLUDED TO HAS

02:04:00.667 --> 02:04:04.137 region:rollup2
BEEN REALLY FUEL BECAUSE

02:04:02.602 --> 02:04:06.539 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION

02:04:04.137 --> 02:04:08.441 region:rollup2
REVERSED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. OF

02:04:06.539 --> 02:04:10.143 region:rollup2
THAT HAD ALLOWED FOR SOME

02:04:08.441 --> 02:04:12.478 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY FOR COMMUNITIES TO

02:04:10.143 --> 02:04:15.682 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT TYPE OF A MILITARY

02:04:12.478 --> 02:04:16.749 region:rollup2
GRADE A EQUIPMENT IS GOING INTO

02:04:15.682 --> 02:04:18.484 region:rollup2
OUR OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

02:04:16.749 --> 02:04:19.986 region:rollup2
I'D ALSO LIKE TO JUST ADDRESS

02:04:18.484 --> 02:04:21.921 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE AROUND PROCESS.

02:04:19.986 --> 02:04:23.856 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE CAN'T

02:04:21.921 --> 02:04:25.558 region:rollup2
MOVE QUICKLY ON IF THEY ARE SO

02:04:23.856 --> 02:04:27.727 region:rollup2
COMPELLED AND COULD SET UP

02:04:25.558 --> 02:04:29.495 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES OUGHT TO PRE APPROVE

02:04:27.727 --> 02:04:30.596 region:rollup2
OR OTHERWISE ADDRESS THE

02:04:29.495 --> 02:04:32.465 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY THAT IF THE TRUMP

02:04:30.596 --> 02:04:33.032 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION. WANTED TO PASS

02:04:32.465 --> 02:04:34.967 region:rollup2
ON.

02:04:33.032 --> 02:04:36.369 region:rollup2
MILITARY GRADE EQUIPMENT THAT

02:04:34.967 --> 02:04:37.236 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WOULD BE READY TO DO

02:04:36.369 --> 02:04:38.938 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS.

02:04:37.236 --> 02:04:40.373 region:rollup2
NOT FORBIDDEN UNDER THIS

02:04:38.938 --> 02:04:41.474 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION AND I WOULD JUST

THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL

02:04:44.577 --> 02:04:47.313 region:rollup2
THAT PREVENTS ANY OF THIS

02:04:46.412 --> 02:04:49.048 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT FROM GOING TO LOCAL

02:04:47.313 --> 02:04:50.483 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES OR SAYING IS THAT WE

02:04:49.048 --> 02:04:51.617 region:rollup2
NEED. A LITTLE BIT OF

02:04:50.483 --> 02:04:53.086 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY A LITTLE BIT OF

02:04:51.617 --> 02:04:54.120 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY A LITTLE BETTER

02:04:53.086 --> 02:04:56.489 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND WITH THAT

02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:57.990 region:rollup2
RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT.

02:04:56.489 --> 02:05:00.460 region:rollup2
THANK YOU HARM AND I AGREE WITH

02:04:57.990 --> 02:05:02.195 region:rollup2
THE VICE CHAIR. THAT THAT.

02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:03.730 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC SAFETY

02:05:02.195 --> 02:05:05.898 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS ARE HERE TO DEFEND.

02:05:03.730 --> 02:05:06.999 region:rollup2
AND NOT ATTACK.

02:05:05.898 --> 02:05:07.200 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO TO WORK MORE ON

02:05:06.999 --> 02:05:09.469 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:11.270 region:rollup2
.

02:05:09.469 --> 02:05:12.805 region:rollup2
IRONICALLY I THINK YOUR BILL

02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:15.875 region:rollup2
COULD HELP US GET TO THAT FOR

02:05:12.805 --> 02:05:16.275 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE WOULD TRANSPARENCY.

02:05:15.875 --> 02:05:18.678 region:rollup2
EVEN IF.

02:05:16.275 --> 02:05:21.114 region:rollup2
OF A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR

02:05:18.678 --> 02:05:24.083 region:rollup2
LOCAL CITY COUNCIL APPROVES.

02:05:21.114 --> 02:05:25.952 region:rollup2
SOME TYPE OF MILITARY GRADE OR

02:05:24.083 --> 02:05:27.253 region:rollup2
WHATEVER FALL TO TED DEFINITION.

02:05:25.952 --> 02:05:29.722 region:rollup2
IF THEY BELIEVE THAT IT IS

02:05:27.253 --> 02:05:31.657 region:rollup2
NECESSARY IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

02:05:29.722 --> 02:05:33.893 region:rollup2
AND IS VOTED ON AND RESIDENTS

02:05:31.657 --> 02:05:36.329 region:rollup2
SEE IT AS A UNNECESSARY.

02:05:33.893 --> 02:05:37.497 region:rollup2
PART OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:05:36.329 --> 02:05:39.032 region:rollup2
THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER THAN

02:05:37.497 --> 02:05:40.500 region:rollup2
HAVING TO SHOW UP.

02:05:39.032 --> 02:05:42.301 region:rollup2
AND A COMMUNITY AND THEY NOT

02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:42.735 region:rollup2
KNOW BAD.

02:05:42.301 --> 02:05:44.203 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE TYPE OF.

02:05:42.735 --> 02:05:45.972 region:rollup2
.

02:05:44.203 --> 02:05:46.606 region:rollup2
FORCE PROTECTIVE SAID THEY WILL

02:05:45.972 --> 02:05:49.042 region:rollup2
BE USING.

02:05:46.606 --> 02:05:51.144 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY IS ALWAYS VERY

02:05:49.042 --> 02:05:52.912 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND I DO KNOW LOCAL

02:05:51.144 --> 02:05:55.214 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS CAN MOVE QUICKLY.

02:05:52.912 --> 02:05:56.549 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THE NOTION.

02:05:55.214 --> 02:05:58.851 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:05:56.549 --> 02:06:00.586 region:rollup2
LAWMAKERS.

02:05:58.851 --> 02:06:02.321 region:rollup2
COULD NOT DECIDE WHAT LAW

02:06:00.586 --> 02:06:04.924 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT DOES IS IS KIND OF

02:06:02.321 --> 02:06:06.259 region:rollup2
LOCUSTS.

02:06:04.924 --> 02:06:07.093 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN HEARING THAT FOR QUITE

02:06:06.259 --> 02:06:08.761 region:rollup2
AWHILE. AND IT'S.

02:06:07.093 --> 02:06:10.129 region:rollup2
.

02:06:08.761 --> 02:06:11.531 region:rollup2
AT I KNOW IT THREE BRANCHES OF

02:06:10.129 --> 02:06:13.933 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

02:06:11.531 --> 02:06:16.636 region:rollup2
HOWEVER YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER

02:06:13.933 --> 02:06:18.571 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE WHO MAKE LAWS ALSO.

02:06:16.636 --> 02:06:20.473 region:rollup2
ON DECIDE TO BUDGETARY

02:06:18.571 --> 02:06:22.241 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS OF THOSE LAWS AND

02:06:20.473 --> 02:06:23.676 region:rollup2
DECIDE HOW THOSE RESOURCES ARE

02:06:22.241 --> 02:06:25.812 region:rollup2
DISPERSED. SOBRE RATHER HAVE US

02:06:23.676 --> 02:06:27.513 region:rollup2
WORKING.

02:06:25.812 --> 02:06:29.048 region:rollup2
HARMONIOUSLY TOGETHER. TOOK TO

02:06:27.513 --> 02:06:30.950 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD WITH WITH THAT I

02:06:29.048 --> 02:06:31.584 region:rollup2
THINK THIS BILL HELPS US GET TO

02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:33.986 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:06:31.584 --> 02:06:36.355 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO BEING MAKE IT

02:06:33.986 --> 02:06:36.989 region:rollup2
MORE PROBLEMATIC THE MORE OPEN

02:06:36.355 --> 02:06:38.825 region:rollup2
WE ARE WITH WITH.

02:06:36.989 --> 02:06:39.459 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO MAKE

02:06:38.825 --> 02:06:42.095 region:rollup2
DECISIONS ON HOW TO SPEND THE

02:06:39.459 --> 02:06:43.362 region:rollup2
MONEY. AND THE MORE OPEN YOU ARE

02:06:42.095 --> 02:06:45.064 region:rollup2
WITH THE PUBLIC.

02:06:43.362 --> 02:06:47.533 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT THAT.

02:06:45.064 --> 02:06:49.235 region:rollup2
WHATEVER EQUIPMENT IS NEEDED TO

02:06:47.533 --> 02:06:49.802 region:rollup2
KEEP NOT ONLY CITIZENS SAFE BUT

02:06:49.235 --> 02:06:52.004 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT OF OFFICERS

02:06:49.802 --> 02:06:54.707 region:rollup2
SAFE.

02:06:52.004 --> 02:06:55.341 region:rollup2
WILL BE ON A GREAT ASSET SO THAT

02:06:54.707 --> 02:06:57.944 region:rollup2
THAT THE CHAIRS RECOMMENDED AYE

02:06:55.341 --> 02:07:02.715 region:rollup2
VOTE.

02:06:57.944 --> 02:07:05.751 region:rollup2

02:20:20.145 --> 02:20:25.884 region:rollup2
BURDEN OF PROOF FOR THIS BILL

02:20:23.682 --> 02:20:30.289 region:rollup2

EVEN WITH A FRIEND.

02:20:41.466 --> 02:20:46.605 region:rollup2
AND SOMEONE MAKES AN ALLEGATION.

02:20:44.436 --> 02:20:49.207 region:rollup2
THAT I HAVE SAID SOMETHING OR IN

02:20:46.605 --> 02:20:50.909 region:rollup2

AND I THINK THAT THAT'S AN

02:21:04.690 --> 02:21:08.393 region:rollup2
INTERESTING QUESTION AS WITH ALL

02:21:06.491 --> 02:21:10.128 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL CASES THE BURDEN OF

EACH AND EVERYONE OF THOSE

02:21:17.903 --> 02:21:20.172 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS IS THERE'S PROBABLE

02:21:19.504 --> 02:21:22.207 region:rollup2
CAUSE TO ARREST.

02:21:20.172 --> 02:21:23.175 region:rollup2
NOW.

02:21:22.207 --> 02:21:24.743 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO THE DISTRICT

02:21:23.175 --> 02:21:26.178 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR FILING AND

02:21:24.743 --> 02:21:27.546 region:rollup2

DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE

SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT PROSECUTE

02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:35.320 region:rollup2
CASES.

02:21:33.952 --> 02:21:37.022 region:rollup2
AND OFTENTIMES WHEN WE'RE

02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:38.657 region:rollup2
REVIEWING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:21:37.022 --> 02:21:40.859 region:rollup2
CAN WE PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE

02:21:38.657 --> 02:21:41.960 region:rollup2
DOUBT WHETHER OR NOT THE

02:21:40.859 --> 02:21:43.895 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS ARE MEANT AND IT

02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:46.565 region:rollup2
REQUIRES EACH AN HOUR EVERY

02:21:43.895 --> 02:21:48.133 region:rollup2
ELEMENT OF THE CRIME. TO BE MET

02:21:46.565 --> 02:21:50.369 region:rollup2
WITH ITS KIND OF PEOPLE LIKE IT

02:21:48.133 --> 02:21:51.203 region:rollup2
TO A RECIPE AFTER HAVE ALL THE

INGREDIENTS YOU CAN'T LEAVE OUT

02:21:51.203 --> 02:21:55.841 region:rollup2
ONE. SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE ALL OF

02:21:53.405 --> 02:21:57.008 region:rollup2
THEM WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT

02:21:55.841 --> 02:21:59.711 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE.

02:21:57.008 --> 02:22:01.613 region:rollup2
CAN THE ELEMENTS OR BROKEN DOWN

02:21:59.711 --> 02:22:03.048 region:rollup2
INTO JURY INSTRUCTIONS IS THEIR

02:22:01.613 --> 02:22:04.649 region:rollup2
FACTS THAT GO TO EACH AND EVERY

02:22:03.048 --> 02:22:06.918 region:rollup2
ELEMENT.

02:22:04.649 --> 02:22:09.021 region:rollup2
WHEN LOOKING AT SPECIFICALLY A

02:22:06.918 --> 02:22:11.456 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL THREAT STATUE WHICH WAS

02:22:09.021 --> 02:22:12.557 region:rollup2
AMENDED SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO

02:22:11.456 --> 02:22:14.226 region:rollup2
INCLUDE ELECTRONIC

02:22:12.557 --> 02:22:16.161 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE OF THE

02:22:14.226 --> 02:22:18.030 region:rollup2
CHANGING TIMES.

02:22:16.161 --> 02:22:19.564 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT.

02:22:18.030 --> 02:22:21.566 region:rollup2
NOW THAT THEY CAN BE DONE BY

02:22:19.564 --> 02:22:22.968 region:rollup2
SOCIAL MEDIA SO WE HAVE TO LOOK

02:22:21.566 --> 02:22:24.870 region:rollup2
AND SEE EACH AND EVERY ELEMENT

02:22:22.968 --> 02:22:26.872 region:rollup2
IS THERE.

02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:28.507 region:rollup2
THE BURDEN IS ON THE PROSECUTION

02:22:26.872 --> 02:22:30.142 region:rollup2
TO PROVE THOSE ELEMENTS BEYOND A

02:22:28.507 --> 02:22:32.277 region:rollup2
REASONABLE DOUBT.

02:22:30.142 --> 02:22:34.546 region:rollup2
WHEN THE ONLY THING THAT THIS

02:22:32.277 --> 02:22:36.581 region:rollup2
BILL WOULD CHANGE IS NOT THE

02:22:34.546 --> 02:22:38.817 region:rollup2
BURDEN OF PROOF OR ANYTHING

02:22:36.581 --> 02:22:40.619 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE LA OTHER THEN IT WOULD

02:22:38.817 --> 02:22:42.521 region:rollup2
SIMPLY ALLOW.

02:22:40.619 --> 02:22:45.123 region:rollup2
THE TARGET OF THE THREAT TO

02:22:42.521 --> 02:22:47.159 region:rollup2
INCLUDE.

02:22:45.123 --> 02:22:49.227 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND CHURCHES.

02:22:47.159 --> 02:22:51.096 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

02:22:49.227 --> 02:22:52.631 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC THREAT AGAINST A

02:22:51.096 --> 02:22:54.433 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC PERSON.

02:22:52.631 --> 02:22:55.867 region:rollup2
SO I WAS TALKING TO MY TWELVE

02:22:54.433 --> 02:22:58.270 region:rollup2
YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO IS ALL

02:22:55.867 --> 02:22:59.304 region:rollup2
INTO POLITICS OF SHE'S GOING TO

02:22:58.270 --> 02:23:01.006 region:rollup2
BE SUPER EXCITED TO WATCH THIS.

02:22:59.304 --> 02:23:01.640 region:rollup2
WAVING AT HER RIGHT NOW.

02:23:01.006 --> 02:23:03.742 region:rollup2
SO.

02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:05.877 region:rollup2
SHE IS I WAS TALKING TO HER

02:23:03.742 --> 02:23:07.512 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT AND I SAID OKAY IF

02:23:05.877 --> 02:23:08.680 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY CAME TO YOUR SCHOOL.

02:23:07.512 --> 02:23:10.048 region:rollup2
AND THEY THREATENED YOUR

02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:11.616 region:rollup2
PRINCIPAL AND THEY SAID I'M

02:23:10.048 --> 02:23:13.418 region:rollup2
GONNA KILL THE PRINCIPLE.

02:23:11.616 --> 02:23:14.419 region:rollup2
AND THE PRINCIPAL WAS AFRAID

02:23:13.418 --> 02:23:16.154 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY

02:23:14.419 --> 02:23:17.289 region:rollup2
CHARGED UNDER FOR TWENTY TWO OF

02:23:16.154 --> 02:23:18.790 region:rollup2
A CRIMINAL THREAT. UNDER OUR

02:23:17.289 --> 02:23:21.560 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW.

02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:22.160 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IF THAT SEEMS STUDENT

02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:24.529 region:rollup2
SAID I'M GOING TO GO AND BLOW

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:26.631 region:rollup2
UP.

02:23:24.529 --> 02:23:28.667 region:rollup2
HER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

02:23:26.631 --> 02:23:30.635 region:rollup2
IT WOULDN'T QUALIFY AND NOT

02:23:28.667 --> 02:23:32.204 region:rollup2
SIMPLY BECAUSE IN THE CURRENT

02:23:30.635 --> 02:23:34.706 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION IT HAS TO BE A

02:23:32.204 --> 02:23:37.142 region:rollup2
PERSON. THAT IS THE TARGET OF

02:23:34.706 --> 02:23:37.709 region:rollup2
THE OFFENSE AND THE PERSON THAT

02:23:37.142 --> 02:23:41.379 region:rollup2
IS.

02:23:37.709 --> 02:23:41.880 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE AFRAID FOR THEMSELVES.

02:23:41.379 --> 02:23:43.315 region:rollup2
OR FOR SOMEONE IN THEIR

02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:45.350 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE FAMILY IT DOESN'T

02:23:43.315 --> 02:23:47.552 region:rollup2
APPLY TO THE SCHOOL. SO WHAT

02:23:45.350 --> 02:23:48.587 region:rollup2
THIS WHAT THAT MY DAUGHTER SAID

02:23:47.552 --> 02:23:50.355 region:rollup2
WHEN SHE HEARD THIS WAS WELL

02:23:48.587 --> 02:23:52.257 region:rollup2
HOLD ON A SECOND.

02:23:50.355 --> 02:23:54.192 region:rollup2
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT ONE IF A

02:23:52.257 --> 02:23:57.729 region:rollup2
KID THREATENS ONE KID THAT ONE

02:23:54.192 --> 02:24:00.232 region:rollup2
KID IS PROTECTED. BUT IF THE.

02:23:57.729 --> 02:24:01.933 region:rollup2
KID THREATENS ALL OF THE KIDS TO

02:24:00.232 --> 02:24:03.068 region:rollup2
ALL TWELVE HUNDRED OF THEM THEN

02:24:01.933 --> 02:24:04.102 region:rollup2
ALL TWELVE HUNDRED OF THOSE KIDS

02:24:03.068 --> 02:24:06.605 region:rollup2
ARE NOT PROTECTED.

02:24:04.102 --> 02:24:08.707 region:rollup2
AND SHE WENT.

02:24:06.605 --> 02:24:10.008 region:rollup2
ARE YOU SERIOUS MUM AND THAT'S

02:24:08.707 --> 02:24:11.109 region:rollup2
WHO YOU KNOW SHE CAN TALK

02:24:10.008 --> 02:24:11.710 region:rollup2
STATIONS LIKE WELL THAT DOESN'T

02:24:11.109 --> 02:24:13.979 region:rollup2
MAKE ANY SENSE. AND I'M LIKE

02:24:11.710 --> 02:24:17.349 region:rollup2
WELL RIGHT NOW THE LAW REQUIRES

02:24:13.979 --> 02:24:18.183 region:rollup2
THE PROSECUTION TO IDENTIFY. A

02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:20.385 region:rollup2
VICTIM

02:24:18.183 --> 02:24:22.354 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WHO CAN SAY HEY THIS IS

02:24:20.385 --> 02:24:24.022 region:rollup2
THE VICTIM OF THIS CRIME AND

02:24:22.354 --> 02:24:25.323 region:rollup2
THIS PERSON WAS AFRAID FOR

02:24:24.022 --> 02:24:26.758 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES OR THEIR IMMEDIATE

02:24:25.323 --> 02:24:29.895 region:rollup2
FAMILY.

02:24:26.758 --> 02:24:32.330 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSED AMENDMENT ALLOWS

02:24:29.895 --> 02:24:32.797 region:rollup2
US TO WIN AS A THREAT IS MADE TO

02:24:32.330 --> 02:24:34.733 region:rollup2
A SCHOOL FOR IT TO BE

02:24:32.797 --> 02:24:36.001 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED.

02:24:34.733 --> 02:24:37.669 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS SECTION NOT

02:24:36.001 --> 02:24:40.472 region:rollup2
AUTOMATICALLY PROSECUTED BUT

02:24:37.669 --> 02:24:42.641 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED BECAUSE NOW THE

02:24:40.472 --> 02:24:44.543 region:rollup2
TARGET CAN BE THE SCHOOL.

02:24:42.641 --> 02:24:46.978 region:rollup2
FOR THE CHURCH

02:24:44.543 --> 02:24:49.447 region:rollup2
AND IT CAN BE THE ADMINISTRATOR

02:24:46.978 --> 02:24:51.016 region:rollup2
THAT IS IN FEAR FOR THE

02:24:49.447 --> 02:24:52.450 region:rollup2
CONGREGATION OR FOR THE SCHOOL.

02:24:51.016 --> 02:24:54.619 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

02:24:52.450 --> 02:24:55.253 region:rollup2
THAT IT PROPOSES. AND SO DOESN'T

02:24:54.619 --> 02:24:59.758 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY CHANGE THE BURDEN.

02:24:55.253 --> 02:25:01.726 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:24:59.758 --> 02:25:03.762 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T EXPAND THE REACH IT

02:25:01.726 --> 02:25:05.230 region:rollup2
JUST ALLOWS EIGHTIES.

02:25:03.762 --> 02:25:06.998 region:rollup2
PERSON TO NOT BE ABLE TO GET

02:25:05.230 --> 02:25:13.238 region:rollup2
AWAY WITH THREATENING TWELVE

02:25:06.998 --> 02:25:14.339 region:rollup2
HUNDRED STUDENTS VERSUS WHAT.

02:25:13.238 --> 02:25:17.042 region:rollup2
MISTER LECHNER MISTER KILEY

02:25:14.339 --> 02:25:18.877 region:rollup2

02:25:17.042 --> 02:25:19.811 region:rollup2
MIND BE QUICK I JUST WONDER AS

02:25:18.877 --> 02:25:21.846 region:rollup2
THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE SHIRT

02:25:19.811 --> 02:25:23.348 region:rollup2
HOWARD THREATS HAVE IMPACTED HIM

02:25:21.846 --> 02:25:25.617 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY CAME A DISTANCE TO

02:25:23.348 --> 02:25:26.151 region:rollup2
SHARE SOMETHING SO IF I COULD

02:25:25.617 --> 02:25:27.285 region:rollup2
HEAR THAT I WOULD LIKE TO

02:25:26.151 --> 02:25:27.919 region:rollup2

02:25:33.358 --> 02:25:37.929 region:rollup2
IT DEFINITELY HAS. AFFECTED ME

02:25:35.727 --> 02:25:39.698 region:rollup2
NOT AYE ONGOING BASIS I I TEACH

02:25:37.929 --> 02:25:40.632 region:rollup2
FOURTH GRADE.

02:25:39.698 --> 02:25:42.234 region:rollup2
I TEACH FOURTH GRADE AND.

02:25:40.632 --> 02:25:43.735 region:rollup2
HAVING TO DISCUSS SCHOOL

02:25:42.234 --> 02:25:45.170 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE WITH THE CHILDREN THAT

02:25:43.735 --> 02:25:46.771 region:rollup2
AGE IS A.

02:25:45.170 --> 02:25:48.173 region:rollup2
CONSTANT BURDEN AND.

02:25:46.771 --> 02:25:49.941 region:rollup2
.

02:25:48.173 --> 02:25:53.211 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S INEXCUSABLE THAT.

02:25:49.941 --> 02:25:53.511 region:rollup2
WE COULDN'T PROSECUTE.

02:25:53.211 --> 02:25:55.246 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO.

02:25:53.511 --> 02:25:57.148 region:rollup2
.

02:25:55.246 --> 02:25:59.251 region:rollup2
MAKE THESE THREATS NAY THEY

02:25:57.148 --> 02:25:59.851 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE PROSECUTED WHERE WE

02:25:59.251 --> 02:26:00.819 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION RESCUE

02:25:59.851 --> 02:26:02.921 region:rollup2
SHARE.

02:26:00.819 --> 02:26:03.822 region:rollup2
MISTER KILEY.

02:26:02.921 --> 02:26:05.423 region:rollup2
I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE

02:26:03.822 --> 02:26:07.058 region:rollup2
AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS I'VE

02:26:05.423 --> 02:26:08.560 region:rollup2
HEARD AFTER AND D. A.'S OFFICES

02:26:07.058 --> 02:26:10.262 region:rollup2
IN MY OWN DISTRICT ABOUT THIS

02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:11.830 region:rollup2
VERY PROBLEM THAT REALIZE THAT.

02:26:10.262 --> 02:26:13.031 region:rollup2
THERE IS THIS GAP IN THE LAW

02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:15.800 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE NO WAY.

02:26:13.031 --> 02:26:17.102 region:rollup2
TO TO TACKLE THIS INCREASINGLY.

02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:19.704 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

02:26:17.102 --> 02:26:20.972 region:rollup2
SERIOUS PROBLEM AND I YOU KNOW

02:26:19.704 --> 02:26:21.539 region:rollup2
THIS IS EXACTLY THE WAY THE LAW

02:26:20.972 --> 02:26:23.241 region:rollup2
SHOULD OF ALL WE'RE NOT YOU

02:26:21.539 --> 02:26:24.042 region:rollup2
KNOW.

02:26:23.241 --> 02:26:25.377 region:rollup2
.

02:26:24.042 --> 02:26:26.478 region:rollup2
EXPANDING THINGS WERE JUST

02:26:25.377 --> 02:26:28.413 region:rollup2
CORRECTING FOR AN OVERSIGHT.

02:26:26.478 --> 02:26:30.181 region:rollup2
WITH THIS BILL AND THAT YOU

02:26:28.413 --> 02:26:31.116 region:rollup2
KNOW I THINK THAT WE ALL KNOW AS

02:26:30.181 --> 02:26:32.150 region:rollup2
WE HEARD FROM THE TESTIMONY HOW

02:26:31.116 --> 02:26:33.284 region:rollup2
SERIOUS THE CONSEQUENCES OF

02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:34.486 region:rollup2
THESE THREATS COMMITTEE IN TERMS

02:26:33.284 --> 02:26:35.720 region:rollup2
OF THE FEAR THAT INSPIRES AMONG

02:26:34.486 --> 02:26:36.688 region:rollup2
THE STUDENT BODY IN TERMS OF THE

02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:39.024 region:rollup2
DISRUPTION.

02:26:36.688 --> 02:26:40.659 region:rollup2
TO THE SCHOOL AND THAT SO I

02:26:39.024 --> 02:26:41.760 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS A REALLY SOLID AND

02:26:40.659 --> 02:26:44.129 region:rollup2
COMMON SENSE MEASURE AND I

02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:47.198 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR I AM VERY PLEASED

02:26:44.129 --> 02:26:48.700 region:rollup2
TO MOVE ABOUT.

02:26:47.198 --> 02:26:50.201 region:rollup2
NO THE COMMENTS OF.

02:26:48.700 --> 02:26:51.302 region:rollup2
YOU MAKE.

02:26:50.201 --> 02:26:52.270 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND

02:26:51.302 --> 02:26:54.606 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I

02:26:52.270 --> 02:26:55.840 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE YOUR 'M ATTENTION TO

02:26:54.606 --> 02:26:57.475 region:rollup2
THE WITNESSES WHO CAME ON BOTH

02:26:55.840 --> 02:27:01.046 region:rollup2
SIDES.

02:26:57.475 --> 02:27:03.014 region:rollup2
I THINK.

02:27:01.046 --> 02:27:04.949 region:rollup2
MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR ME IN THIS

02:27:03.014 --> 02:27:07.652 region:rollup2
BILL THAN ANY OTHER THING THAT

02:27:04.949 --> 02:27:09.220 region:rollup2
IT DIES IS THE ABILITY THAT IT

02:27:07.652 --> 02:27:11.156 region:rollup2
WILL LOOK FORWARD TO INTERVENE

02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:13.425 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO MENTAL HEALTH.

02:27:11.156 --> 02:27:16.661 region:rollup2
THIS THIS ALLOWS US AN

02:27:13.425 --> 02:27:18.730 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO TO GET TO A

02:27:16.661 --> 02:27:20.832 region:rollup2
STUDENT PERHAPS AND GET THEM THE

02:27:18.730 --> 02:27:22.801 region:rollup2
HELP THAT THEY NEED BEFORE THIS

02:27:20.832 --> 02:27:24.436 region:rollup2
GOES DOWN THE WRONG PATH RIGHT.

02:27:22.801 --> 02:27:27.172 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS A BILL THAT COIN.

02:27:24.436 --> 02:27:28.573 region:rollup2
THIS JUST CHANGES IT TO.

02:27:27.172 --> 02:27:30.075 region:rollup2
IT'S A WILD BOAR COULD BE

02:27:28.573 --> 02:27:31.710 region:rollup2
MISDEMEANOR COULD BE A FELONY

02:27:30.075 --> 02:27:33.378 region:rollup2
IT'S A LOT MORE BUT THIS THIS

02:27:31.710 --> 02:27:35.714 region:rollup2
GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A

02:27:33.378 --> 02:27:37.582 region:rollup2
JUDGE TO SAY OKAY YOU NEED TO GO

02:27:35.714 --> 02:27:38.883 region:rollup2
AND GET SOME TYPE OF TREATMENT

02:27:37.582 --> 02:27:39.451 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE THINK. YOU ARE SAY

02:27:38.883 --> 02:27:41.486 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING SIMILAR ISSUES

02:27:39.451 --> 02:27:43.755 region:rollup2
HERE.

02:27:41.486 --> 02:27:44.756 region:rollup2
SOME VIOLENT TENDENCIES AND WE

02:27:43.755 --> 02:27:46.658 region:rollup2
WANT TO GET THAT CORRECTED

02:27:44.756 --> 02:27:48.326 region:rollup2
WORRIES RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE

02:27:46.658 --> 02:27:48.960 region:rollup2
THAT ABILITY.

02:27:48.326 --> 02:27:50.195 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO

02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:52.230 region:rollup2
THAT UNLESS.

02:27:50.195 --> 02:27:55.066 region:rollup2
IT WAS A STUDENT GOES TO SCHOOL

02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:56.601 region:rollup2
AND SAYS I'M GOING TO SHOOT.

02:27:55.066 --> 02:27:59.671 region:rollup2
JANE DOE.

02:27:56.601 --> 02:28:00.672 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T CHARGE.

02:27:59.671 --> 02:28:01.673 region:rollup2
THE WAY WE WOULD LIKE FOR THEM

02:28:00.672 --> 02:28:03.074 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO DO UNDER THE

02:28:01.673 --> 02:28:05.710 region:rollup2
SPELLING INTERVENE.

02:28:03.074 --> 02:28:07.412 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S I THINK IT WAS.

02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:08.113 region:rollup2
REALLY A GREAT STATEMENT TO MAKE

02:28:07.412 --> 02:28:10.949 region:rollup2
BY.

02:28:08.113 --> 02:28:13.051 region:rollup2
MY WITNESSES DAUGHTER THAT.

02:28:10.949 --> 02:28:14.986 region:rollup2
IF YOU THREATEN ONE STUDENT.

02:28:13.051 --> 02:28:15.787 region:rollup2
VAN LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL

02:28:14.986 --> 02:28:17.555 region:rollup2
INTERVENE IN MENTAL HEALTH

02:28:15.787 --> 02:28:18.957 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS CAN INTERVENE IF

02:28:17.555 --> 02:28:19.958 region:rollup2
YOU THREATEN THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

02:28:18.957 --> 02:28:21.960 region:rollup2
EVERYONE IS LEFT

02:28:19.958 --> 02:28:22.761 region:rollup2
TO WORRY.

02:28:21.960 --> 02:28:24.062 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A FAIR

02:28:22.761 --> 02:28:25.063 region:rollup2
THING TO DO OUR STUDENTS IT'S

02:28:24.062 --> 02:28:26.798 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY NOT A FAIR THING TO DO

02:28:25.063 --> 02:28:28.566 region:rollup2
OUR PARENTS.

02:28:26.798 --> 02:28:30.168 region:rollup2
THIS HAPPENED AT MY OWN

02:28:28.566 --> 02:28:31.936 region:rollup2
CHILDREN'S SCHOOL WHERE I MEAN

02:28:30.168 --> 02:28:33.505 region:rollup2
ONE THREAT COMES DOWN AND THE

02:28:31.936 --> 02:28:34.672 region:rollup2
NEXT THING YOU KNOW.

02:28:33.505 --> 02:28:35.774 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THE PARENTS ARE LOSING

02:28:34.672 --> 02:28:37.375 region:rollup2
THEIR MINDS ARE PULLING THEIR

02:28:35.774 --> 02:28:38.877 region:rollup2
KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL THERE'S THEN

02:28:37.375 --> 02:28:40.712 region:rollup2
THEY TAKE TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND

02:28:38.877 --> 02:28:42.614 region:rollup2
THEN IT GROWS BIGGER AND BIGGER

02:28:40.712 --> 02:28:44.382 region:rollup2
AND BIGGER IN THIS IN THE FEAR.

02:28:42.614 --> 02:28:46.184 region:rollup2
JUST CONTINUES TO SPREAD SO I

02:28:44.382 --> 02:28:48.586 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER

02:28:46.184 --> 02:28:49.387 region:rollup2
IN THIS THAT WE DON'T DO.

02:28:48.586 --> 02:28:50.755 region:rollup2
THE INTENT ISN'T TO.

02:28:49.387 --> 02:28:52.590 region:rollup2
.

02:28:50.755 --> 02:28:54.092 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:56.694 region:rollup2
WHO GET ARRESTED OR INCARCERATE

02:28:54.092 --> 02:28:59.197 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT IT THE INTENT IS TO

02:28:56.694 --> 02:29:00.532 region:rollup2
STOP THESE. TYPES OF THINGS FROM

02:28:59.197 --> 02:29:02.200 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN INTERVENE WHEN WE

02:29:00.532 --> 02:29:04.002 region:rollup2
CAN'T TO GET THESE KIDS THE HELP

02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:05.270 region:rollup2
THAT WE.

02:29:04.002 --> 02:29:07.138 region:rollup2
BECAUSE REALLY IF YOU THINK

02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:08.740 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT SOMEONE WHO MAKES.

02:29:07.138 --> 02:29:09.207 region:rollup2
A THREAT LIKE THAT AGAINST THEIR

02:29:08.740 --> 02:29:12.143 region:rollup2
SCHOOL OR THEIR CHURCH

02:29:09.207 --> 02:29:12.677 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY.

02:29:12.143 --> 02:29:14.379 region:rollup2
SOMETHING'S WRONG IN THEIR

02:29:12.677 --> 02:29:15.146 region:rollup2
MINDS.

02:29:14.379 --> 02:29:16.748 region:rollup2
WHICH IS CAUSING THEM TO FEEL

02:29:15.146 --> 02:29:18.116 region:rollup2
THE WAY THEY DO.

02:29:16.748 --> 02:29:20.151 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE FOR US TO HAVE THE

02:29:18.116 --> 02:29:21.686 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THAT.

02:29:20.151 --> 02:29:22.453 region:rollup2
SO THAT A TRAGEDY DOESN'T TAKE

02:29:21.686 --> 02:29:24.422 region:rollup2
PLACE IN THAT PERSON.

02:29:22.453 --> 02:29:26.324 region:rollup2

02:36:41.759 --> 02:36:44.228 region:rollup2
WHETHER HE REALLY OF THAT PERSON

02:36:43.628 --> 02:36:44.795 region:rollup2
REALLY NEEDS TO BE IMPRISONED

02:36:44.228 --> 02:36:46.964 region:rollup2
ANYMORE.

02:36:44.795 --> 02:36:48.699 region:rollup2
I.

02:36:46.964 --> 02:36:50.835 region:rollup2
THE LAST ISSUE I JUST WANT TO

02:36:48.699 --> 02:36:52.403 region:rollup2
TOUCH ON IN THIS BRIEF TIME. I

02:36:50.835 --> 02:36:53.905 region:rollup2
IS JUST ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT I

02:36:52.403 --> 02:36:55.539 region:rollup2
MEAN JUST TO REMINDER DISTRICT

02:36:53.905 --> 02:36:56.974 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY IS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL

02:36:55.539 --> 02:36:58.509 region:rollup2
I EASE USUALLY HERE SHE IS

02:36:56.974 --> 02:36:59.977 region:rollup2
USUALLY THE HIGHEST RANKING

02:36:58.509 --> 02:37:01.946 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL JUSTICE. IS OFFICIAL

02:36:59.977 --> 02:37:04.382 region:rollup2
AND I COUNTY AND AS SUCH I THINK

02:37:01.946 --> 02:37:06.284 region:rollup2
UNIQUELY SITUATED TO TO BALANCE

02:37:04.382 --> 02:37:07.218 region:rollup2
THE EQUITIES AS THE COMMUNITY

02:37:06.284 --> 02:37:08.686 region:rollup2
SEES FED.

02:37:07.218 --> 02:37:12.089 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T SEE THIS IS A.

02:37:08.686 --> 02:37:13.724 region:rollup2
A RADICALIZED IT IS A A CHANGE

02:37:12.089 --> 02:37:15.793 region:rollup2
IN THE LAW THAT ADDS A TOOL.

02:37:13.724 --> 02:37:17.528 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE

02:37:15.793 --> 02:37:18.763 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY OF OUR CONVICTIONS AND

02:37:17.528 --> 02:37:19.931 region:rollup2
SENTENCES.

02:37:18.763 --> 02:37:21.632 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S ALSO IF YOU SUPPORT

02:37:19.931 --> 02:37:23.567 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CURRENTLY WE

02:37:21.632 --> 02:37:24.769 region:rollup2
HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE THE

02:37:23.567 --> 02:37:25.936 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE BRANCH THE BOARD OF

02:37:24.769 --> 02:37:27.705 region:rollup2
PAROLE WHO IS THE POWER TO

02:37:25.936 --> 02:37:29.540 region:rollup2
RECALL A SENTENCE ALL THIS WOULD

02:37:27.705 --> 02:37:30.875 region:rollup2
DO WOULD BE TO ADD ANOTHER

02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:32.209 region:rollup2
MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

02:37:30.875 --> 02:37:33.844 region:rollup2
BUT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE ELECTED

02:37:32.209 --> 02:37:35.212 region:rollup2
DISTRICT ATTORNEY. SO I THINK

02:37:33.844 --> 02:37:36.247 region:rollup2
FOR BOTH THOSE REASONS THIS

02:37:35.212 --> 02:37:37.615 region:rollup2
WOULD BE REALLY GOOD LAW THANK

02:37:36.247 --> 02:37:39.250 region:rollup2
YOU. THANK YOU.

02:37:37.615 --> 02:37:40.551 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAD GOOD MORNING MEMBERS

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:37:40.551 --> 02:37:44.388 region:rollup2

FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. MY NAME

IS HILARY BLOW OUT I'M A FORMER

02:37:45.556 --> 02:37:48.960 region:rollup2
PROSECUTOR HERE FROM CALIFORNIA

02:37:47.425 --> 02:37:50.494 region:rollup2
BUT I SPENT THE LAST

02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:52.196 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF YEARS NOW WORKING.

02:37:50.494 --> 02:37:53.664 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:37:52.196 --> 02:37:55.266 region:rollup2
REFORM EFFORTS POLICY

02:37:53.664 --> 02:37:56.701 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES REALLY TRYING TO

02:37:55.266 --> 02:37:58.669 region:rollup2
STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT I

02:37:56.701 --> 02:37:59.437 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IS. IT CRITICAL FOR ALL

02:37:58.669 --> 02:38:01.238 region:rollup2
OF US TO CONSIDER IS PUBLIC

02:37:59.437 --> 02:38:02.840 region:rollup2
SAFETY BUT ALSO BALANCING THAT

02:38:01.238 --> 02:38:03.874 region:rollup2
WITH THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE

02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:05.876 region:rollup2
AND ALSO TRYING TO MOVE AWAY

02:38:03.874 --> 02:38:07.611 region:rollup2
FROM OUR OVER RELIANCE ON

02:38:05.876 --> 02:38:09.347 region:rollup2
INCARCERATION AS A MEANS OF

02:38:07.611 --> 02:38:10.715 region:rollup2
MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER. SO

02:38:09.347 --> 02:38:13.117 region:rollup2
THIS BILL REALLY STRIKES A

02:38:10.715 --> 02:38:14.618 region:rollup2
BALANCE OF ALL OF THOSE GOALS

02:38:13.117 --> 02:38:16.020 region:rollup2
I'M WE WERE CAREFUL IN DRAFTING

02:38:14.618 --> 02:38:17.855 region:rollup2
THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:38:16.020 --> 02:38:19.256 region:rollup2
WERE KEEPING IN MIND THE

02:38:17.855 --> 02:38:20.424 region:rollup2
SENSITIVITIES AROUND COURTS AND

02:38:19.256 --> 02:38:22.626 region:rollup2
THE SCARCE RESOURCES THAT THEY

02:38:20.424 --> 02:38:24.562 region:rollup2
HAVE. ON AND SO THIS BILL DOES

02:38:22.626 --> 02:38:26.464 region:rollup2
NOT CREATE ANY NEW PROCESSES

02:38:24.562 --> 02:38:27.264 region:rollup2
INSTEAD IT LEVERAGES AN EXISTING

02:38:26.464 --> 02:38:29.400 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

02:38:27.264 --> 02:38:30.935 region:rollup2
THERE WHERE COURTS ARE ALREADY

02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:32.737 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING THE THE INTEREST OF

02:38:30.935 --> 02:38:35.106 region:rollup2
JUSTICE IN CONSIDERING PUBLIC

02:38:32.737 --> 02:38:37.108 region:rollup2
SAFETY BUT ALL IT DOES MERELY IS

02:38:35.106 --> 02:38:38.976 region:rollup2
ADDED THE DA'S TO BE ABLE TO

02:38:37.108 --> 02:38:40.745 region:rollup2
EXERCISE THE SAME DISCRETION

02:38:38.976 --> 02:38:42.146 region:rollup2
THAT THE EXERCISE AT THE OUTSET

02:38:40.745 --> 02:38:44.382 region:rollup2
OF THE CASE. AT THE FRONT END

02:38:42.146 --> 02:38:46.350 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO AT THE BACKEND.

02:38:44.382 --> 02:38:47.752 region:rollup2
THANKFULLY WE'VE HAD SEVERAL

02:38:46.350 --> 02:38:49.820 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:38:47.752 --> 02:38:51.889 region:rollup2
PASSED THAT CREATE ADDITIONAL

02:38:49.820 --> 02:38:53.858 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN

02:38:51.889 --> 02:38:55.593 region:rollup2
OUR PRISONS WHO ARE SUITABLE FOR

02:38:53.858 --> 02:38:57.194 region:rollup2
RELEASE BUT I THINK WE ALL CAN

02:38:55.593 --> 02:38:58.929 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT THAT BURDEN THAT

02:38:57.194 --> 02:39:01.532 region:rollup2
FALLS ON THE BOARD OF PAROLE

02:38:58.929 --> 02:39:04.201 region:rollup2
HEARINGS. IS A GREAT ONE AND SO

02:39:01.532 --> 02:39:05.770 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER ENTITY ESPECIALLY SOME

02:39:04.201 --> 02:39:07.238 region:rollup2
AN ENTITY LIKE THE DA'S OFFICE

02:39:05.770 --> 02:39:09.106 region:rollup2
THAT CAN PARTICIPATE IN

02:39:07.238 --> 02:39:10.374 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING OTHER INDIVIDUALS

02:39:09.106 --> 02:39:12.076 region:rollup2

DIRECTION OF REDUCING OUR

02:39:19.250 --> 02:39:23.788 region:rollup2
OVERRELIANCE ON INCARCERATION.

02:39:20.584 --> 02:39:25.456 region:rollup2

02:41:23.974 --> 02:41:27.211 region:rollup2
FOR FIRST WILL WONDER MARCY'S

02:41:25.643 --> 02:41:28.312 region:rollup2
LAW AS A VICTIM IS ENTITLED TO

02:41:27.211 --> 02:41:29.213 region:rollup2
BE NOTIFIED WHENEVER THERE'S

02:41:28.312 --> 02:41:31.081 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE A CHANGE IN THE

SENTENCE OR OR HEARING THAT

02:41:31.081 --> 02:41:34.451 region:rollup2
COULD IMPACT THAT SENTENCE.

02:41:32.550 --> 02:41:35.886 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY BY PRACTICE AND I

02:41:34.451 --> 02:41:39.490 region:rollup2
SHOULD SAY PASSION AND CALLING

02:41:35.886 --> 02:41:39.490 region:rollup2
THEM AYE I KNOW EVERY PHILLIP

02:41:39.557 --> 02:41:42.393 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE GOT

02:41:40.724 --> 02:41:43.594 region:rollup2
INTO THE WORK THAT WE DO. IN THE

02:41:42.393 --> 02:41:45.696 region:rollup2
CASE OF MISTER GARCIA THAT I

02:41:43.594 --> 02:41:46.997 region:rollup2

02:41:45.696 --> 02:41:48.699 region:rollup2
WE'VE WORKED UPON.

02:41:46.997 --> 02:41:50.801 region:rollup2
WE WOULD NOTIFY.

02:41:48.699 --> 02:41:52.703 region:rollup2
THE VICTIMS HAVE CERTAINLY

02:41:50.801 --> 02:41:55.105 region:rollup2
REMEMBER FOR THIS IT'S A RE

02:41:52.703 --> 02:41:55.973 region:rollup2
SENTENCING SO IF THE SENTENCE IS

02:41:55.105 --> 02:41:57.808 region:rollup2
RECALL.

02:41:55.973 --> 02:41:59.877 region:rollup2

ALL THIS HAS GONE FROM A JUDGE

02:41:59.877 --> 02:42:03.013 region:rollup2
SO THEN LEGAL YOUR PLACES IF NEW

02:42:01.512 --> 02:42:04.715 region:rollup2

EARLY ON TO MAKE SURE THEIR

02:42:21.865 --> 02:42:26.604 region:rollup2
VOICES ARE HEARD AND. AN HONOR.

02:42:24.835 --> 02:42:27.671 region:rollup2

02:42:26.604 --> 02:42:28.305 region:rollup2
CAN SAY I'M ONE OF THE BREEZE

02:42:27.671 --> 02:42:30.507 region:rollup2
ONCE I'VE WORKED ON.

02:42:28.305 --> 02:42:31.842 region:rollup2
.

02:42:30.507 --> 02:42:33.844 region:rollup2
IT WAS A SERIES OF BURGLARIES

02:42:31.842 --> 02:42:35.813 region:rollup2
FOR VERY LONG TIME AGO.

02:42:33.844 --> 02:42:37.348 region:rollup2

INDIVIDUAL STILL IN PRISON? A

02:42:47.324 --> 02:42:50.494 region:rollup2
DECADES AFTER WHAT HE HAD VIEWED

02:42:48.993 --> 02:42:52.563 region:rollup2
AS A CRIME THAT I DIDN'T DESERVE

02:42:50.494 --> 02:42:54.064 region:rollup2
IT SO THAT DIDN'T DECIDE IF IT

02:42:52.563 --> 02:42:54.865 region:rollup2
WAS SOMETHING.

02:42:54.064 --> 02:42:56.433 region:rollup2
WE TOOK INTO ACCOUNT AND IF YOU

02:42:54.865 --> 02:42:59.003 region:rollup2
WE EXPRESSED.

02:42:56.433 --> 02:43:00.571 region:rollup2
OKAY MISCARRY.

AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR

02:43:01.538 --> 02:43:03.941 region:rollup2
ATTENTION.

02:43:02.706 --> 02:43:05.542 region:rollup2
WHAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS

02:43:03.941 --> 02:43:06.844 region:rollup2
BILL IS THAT IT ACTUALLY BRINGS

02:43:05.542 --> 02:43:09.079 region:rollup2
TO LIGHT THE?

02:43:06.844 --> 02:43:09.880 region:rollup2
NATIONAL CASE.

02:43:09.079 --> 02:43:11.448 region:rollup2
WHEN THE HIP HOP ARTIST NAME

02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:13.250 region:rollup2
MAKE MALE WHO.

02:43:11.448 --> 02:43:15.019 region:rollup2
HAS ALSO SPARKED THE

02:43:13.250 --> 02:43:17.588 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NATIONAL

02:43:15.019 --> 02:43:18.956 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM EFFORTS

02:43:17.588 --> 02:43:19.556 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA

02:43:18.956 --> 02:43:21.558 region:rollup2
COULD CERTAINLY SET A ROLE IN

02:43:19.556 --> 02:43:26.230 region:rollup2
IN.

02:43:21.558 --> 02:43:27.731 region:rollup2
ENSURING. THAT WE ARE THINKING.

02:43:26.230 --> 02:43:28.932 region:rollup2

TO WHAT WE DO WITH CRIMINAL

02:43:28.932 --> 02:43:34.338 region:rollup2
JUSTICE REFORM. AND HOW WE DON'T

02:43:31.735 --> 02:43:35.572 region:rollup2
INCARCERATE OUR WAY OUT OF

02:43:34.338 --> 02:43:36.573 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS ARE INTO MORE PROBLEMS

02:43:35.572 --> 02:43:38.509 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO

IF YOU WISH CON LAGER. THEY TWO

02:43:50.354 --> 02:43:53.924 region:rollup2
ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR

02:43:52.089 --> 02:43:56.560 region:rollup2
BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION I

02:43:53.924 --> 02:43:59.463 region:rollup2
WOULD ACTUALLY ARGUE THAT.

02:43:56.560 --> 02:44:01.598 region:rollup2
CASES LIKE MR GARCIA'S ARE NOT

02:43:59.463 --> 02:44:03.467 region:rollup2
RARE IN DEED THEY ARE PROBABLY

02:44:01.598 --> 02:44:04.468 region:rollup2
MORE COMMON THAN WE CARE TO

02:44:03.467 --> 02:44:06.503 region:rollup2
ADMIT.

02:44:04.468 --> 02:44:08.405 region:rollup2
BUT IF WE WERE TO ADMIT THAT WE

02:44:06.503 --> 02:44:10.140 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE

02:44:08.405 --> 02:44:11.342 region:rollup2
IMPLICIT BIAS THAT IS INHERENT

02:44:10.140 --> 02:44:12.876 region:rollup2
IN MANY OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:44:11.342 --> 02:44:14.812 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS.

02:44:12.876 --> 02:44:15.913 region:rollup2
I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I

02:44:14.812 --> 02:44:18.082 region:rollup2
WANTED TO KNOW ARE THERE ANY

02:44:15.913 --> 02:44:20.718 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS.

02:44:18.082 --> 02:44:21.352 region:rollup2
.

02:44:20.718 --> 02:44:23.220 region:rollup2
THAT I I DON'T KNOW IF MAYBE I

02:44:21.352 --> 02:44:27.091 region:rollup2
DIDN'T SEE THEM BUT IN TERMS OF.

02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:28.692 region:rollup2
.

02:44:27.091 --> 02:44:30.394 region:rollup2
WILL THE I BELIEVE THE WAY THE

02:44:28.692 --> 02:44:30.627 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS OF WORK AND IT'S

02:44:30.394 --> 02:44:32.229 region:rollup2
REALLY.

02:44:30.627 --> 02:44:33.764 region:rollup2
A.

02:44:32.229 --> 02:44:35.165 region:rollup2
MERE ANSWER TO THE ONE I GAVE

02:44:33.764 --> 02:44:36.533 region:rollup2
BEFORE SINCE LEGALLY THIS BRINGS

02:44:35.165 --> 02:44:38.102 region:rollup2
US BACK TO THE TIME PRIOR TO

02:44:36.533 --> 02:44:39.303 region:rollup2
SENTENCING.

02:44:38.102 --> 02:44:40.104 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY RESTRICTIONS THAT

02:44:39.303 --> 02:44:42.473 region:rollup2
EXIST.

02:44:40.104 --> 02:44:43.907 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON THE CHARGES SO IN

02:44:42.473 --> 02:44:45.642 region:rollup2
OTHER WORDS SOME CHARGES CAN'T

02:44:43.907 --> 02:44:46.977 region:rollup2
BE LEGALLY STRICT AND SOME

02:44:45.642 --> 02:44:49.179 region:rollup2
CHARGES CAN'T BE.

02:44:46.977 --> 02:44:50.914 region:rollup2
IT MUST BE RUN CONSECUTIVE

02:44:49.179 --> 02:44:52.382 region:rollup2
OTHERS CAN BE RUN CONCURRENT SO

02:44:50.914 --> 02:44:53.584 region:rollup2
ALL THE SAME RESTRICTIONS THAT

02:44:52.382 --> 02:44:55.319 region:rollup2
EXISTING CURRENT LAW WOULD

02:44:53.584 --> 02:44:56.987 region:rollup2
REMAIN.

02:44:55.319 --> 02:44:58.122 region:rollup2
SO THAT PART OF THEY WOULD OUR

02:44:56.987 --> 02:45:00.557 region:rollup2
MAIN HOWEVER THERE IS NO

02:44:58.122 --> 02:45:02.159 region:rollup2
RESTRICTION ON THE TYPE OF CASE

02:45:00.557 --> 02:45:04.495 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY COULD RIP

02:45:02.159 --> 02:45:05.696 region:rollup2
REQUEST FOR RECALL. NOW SOME

02:45:04.495 --> 02:45:08.565 region:rollup2
WILL BE POINTLESS IF SOMEBODY

02:45:05.696 --> 02:45:10.434 region:rollup2
HAS. MANDATORY LIFE WITHOUT

02:45:08.565 --> 02:45:11.568 region:rollup2
PAROLE SENTENCE YOU GO BACK TO

02:45:10.434 --> 02:45:13.637 region:rollup2
SENTENCING WHAT'S GOING EXACT

02:45:11.568 --> 02:45:15.105 region:rollup2
SAME SENTENCE ALL OVER AGAIN BUT

02:45:13.637 --> 02:45:17.107 region:rollup2
OTHERS AS IN THE CASE OF MISTER

02:45:15.105 --> 02:45:17.574 region:rollup2
DARCY AND OTHERS A SIMILAR TO

02:45:17.107 --> 02:45:19.476 region:rollup2
HIM.

02:45:17.574 --> 02:45:20.577 region:rollup2
.

02:45:19.476 --> 02:45:22.012 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE OF THEIR BE A LOT

02:45:20.577 --> 02:45:22.546 region:rollup2
MORE THERE'D BE ALL THE SAME

02:45:22.012 --> 02:45:24.047 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY THAT CURRENTLY

02:45:22.546 --> 02:45:25.048 region:rollup2
EXIST.

02:45:24.047 --> 02:45:26.583 region:rollup2
IS THERE ANY REAL ARE THERE ANY

02:45:25.048 --> 02:45:28.619 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY.

02:45:26.583 --> 02:45:30.754 region:rollup2
ON FOR JUST JUST A POINTER ON

02:45:28.619 --> 02:45:32.956 region:rollup2
PAGE ONE THE ANALYSIS.

02:45:30.754 --> 02:45:34.958 region:rollup2
SPECIFIES* DO NOT APPLY TO

02:45:32.956 --> 02:45:36.794 region:rollup2
ANY INMATES SERVING A. SENTENCE

02:45:34.958 --> 02:45:37.694 region:rollup2
FOR FIRST DEGREE MURDER OR FOR

02:45:36.794 --> 02:45:39.329 region:rollup2
ANY CONVICTION HAVE REQUIRES

02:45:37.694 --> 02:45:39.963 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION AS A SEX.

02:45:39.329 --> 02:45:41.698 region:rollup2
SO THAT ARE I BELIEVE THAT WOULD

02:45:39.963 --> 02:45:43.100 region:rollup2
BE THE.

02:45:41.698 --> 02:45:46.136 region:rollup2
YOU'RE AND THEN ARE THERE ANY IS

02:45:43.100 --> 02:45:47.871 region:rollup2
THERE ANY RELIEF FOR DENIAL.

02:45:46.136 --> 02:45:49.540 region:rollup2
WELL I I THINK IT'S AGAIN GO

02:45:47.871 --> 02:45:51.175 region:rollup2
BACK TO IT SENTENCING SO

02:45:49.540 --> 02:45:52.042 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY CAN ALWAYS. AYE IT WILL

02:45:51.175 --> 02:45:53.944 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON THE POTTERY TO

02:45:52.042 --> 02:45:55.579 region:rollup2
REPEAL OR READ THE DECISION BY

02:45:53.944 --> 02:45:57.548 region:rollup2
THE JUDGE IN THIS IS LIKE ANY

02:45:55.579 --> 02:45:59.450 region:rollup2
OTHER JUDICIAL DECISION.

02:45:57.548 --> 02:46:01.685 region:rollup2
AND I CERTAINLY WOULD HOPE THAT

02:45:59.450 --> 02:46:03.020 region:rollup2
AS WE TALK ABOUT OF MORE BILLS

02:46:01.685 --> 02:46:04.588 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS WERE ALSO LOOKING AT

02:46:03.020 --> 02:46:05.189 region:rollup2
THE CONSISTENCY IN WHICH THESE

02:46:04.588 --> 02:46:07.057 region:rollup2
WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED ACROSS DE

02:46:05.189 --> 02:46:09.893 region:rollup2
A.

02:46:07.057 --> 02:46:11.395 region:rollup2
WELL THROUGHOUT DE A OFFICES

02:46:09.893 --> 02:46:13.530 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE.

02:46:11.395 --> 02:46:14.731 region:rollup2
AND ALSO NOT JUST

02:46:13.530 --> 02:46:18.502 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION BUT TRAINING.

02:46:14.731 --> 02:46:21.004 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF HELPING DA'S.

02:46:18.502 --> 02:46:21.605 region:rollup2
USE A DIFFERENT LANDS AS THEY

02:46:21.004 --> 02:46:23.040 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE CASES THAT COME

02:46:21.605 --> 02:46:24.808 region:rollup2
BEFORE THAT GOT ME AGAIN THIS

02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:27.077 region:rollup2
THIS LAW IT GIVES DISTRICT

02:46:24.808 --> 02:46:28.145 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS OFFICES DISCRETION. SO

02:46:27.077 --> 02:46:31.248 region:rollup2
REALLY IS.

02:46:28.145 --> 02:46:33.217 region:rollup2
UP TO INDIVIDUAL OFFICES TO

02:46:31.248 --> 02:46:34.451 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THIS AS THEY.

02:46:33.217 --> 02:46:35.886 region:rollup2
AS THEY CHOOSE FED OUT OBVIOUSLY

02:46:34.451 --> 02:46:37.955 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT NOT.

02:46:35.886 --> 02:46:40.290 region:rollup2
ALL OFFICES OPERATE IN THE SAME

02:46:37.955 --> 02:46:42.159 region:rollup2
WAY BUT OBVIOUSLY.

02:46:40.290 --> 02:46:43.260 region:rollup2
WE HOPE THAT BY SOME OFFICES

02:46:42.159 --> 02:46:45.496 region:rollup2
LEADING BY EXAMPLE OTHER OFFICES

02:46:43.260 --> 02:46:47.264 region:rollup2
OR FALL.

02:46:45.496 --> 02:46:50.167 region:rollup2
DID.

02:46:47.264 --> 02:46:52.302 region:rollup2
KILEY.

02:46:50.167 --> 02:46:53.136 region:rollup2
I'LL SO I'M PRIDE GENERALLY

02:46:52.302 --> 02:46:55.372 region:rollup2
PRETTY FAVORABLE TOWARDS THIS.

02:46:53.136 --> 02:46:56.540 region:rollup2
THIS IDEA I JUST HAVE A COUPLE

02:46:55.372 --> 02:46:58.809 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS I THAT I WAS A BIT OF

02:46:56.540 --> 02:47:00.143 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION ON AND. ONE IS

02:46:58.809 --> 02:47:01.745 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF THE UNIVERSE OF OF

02:47:00.143 --> 02:47:03.046 region:rollup2
FOLKS THAT IT IT WOULD APPLY TO

02:47:01.745 --> 02:47:04.581 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU MENTIONED THERE ARE

02:47:03.046 --> 02:47:05.749 region:rollup2
A THOUSAND PEOPLE. EITHER

02:47:04.581 --> 02:47:07.684 region:rollup2
INCARCERATED RIGHT NOW.

02:47:05.749 --> 02:47:08.785 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE WHO ARE

02:47:07.684 --> 02:47:11.321 region:rollup2
NON VIOLENT IS THAT RIGHT.

02:47:08.785 --> 02:47:12.556 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST ONE POPULATION AYE

02:47:11.321 --> 02:47:14.157 region:rollup2
CITIZENS RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK

02:47:12.556 --> 02:47:15.592 region:rollup2
WOULD PROBABLY RISE TO THE TOP

02:47:14.157 --> 02:47:16.593 region:rollup2
OF THE PRIORITY LIST AND READ

02:47:15.592 --> 02:47:18.095 region:rollup2
ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE SERVING

02:47:16.593 --> 02:47:19.162 region:rollup2
LONG TERM SENTENCES. TWENTY

02:47:18.095 --> 02:47:20.531 region:rollup2
YEARS OR MORE.

02:47:19.162 --> 02:47:21.632 region:rollup2
FOR A LOW LEVEL NONVIOLENT

02:47:20.531 --> 02:47:23.033 region:rollup2
OFFENSE.

02:47:21.632 --> 02:47:24.534 region:rollup2
BUT THAT DOESN'T BUT THERE'S A

02:47:23.033 --> 02:47:26.670 region:rollup2
OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND

02:47:24.534 --> 02:47:27.671 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN OUR PRISONS SO AND AS

02:47:26.670 --> 02:47:29.239 region:rollup2
IT WAS MENTIONED.

02:47:27.671 --> 02:47:30.607 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO EXCLUSION FOR AN

02:47:29.239 --> 02:47:31.608 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL OR A TYPE OF CASE

02:47:30.607 --> 02:47:33.577 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE UNDER REVIEW BY

02:47:31.608 --> 02:47:35.379 region:rollup2
IDEA.

02:47:33.577 --> 02:47:36.680 region:rollup2
I SEE AND WE HAVE SOME DEBATES

02:47:35.379 --> 02:47:39.583 region:rollup2
HERE ABOUT WHAT'S VIOLENT WHAT'S

02:47:36.680 --> 02:47:40.717 region:rollup2
NONVIOLENT SO AYE I. WHAT TYPE

02:47:39.583 --> 02:47:41.618 region:rollup2
OF TYPE OF OFFENSE THAT WE

02:47:40.717 --> 02:47:42.886 region:rollup2
GENERALLY DON'T THERE WHEN IT'S

02:47:41.618 --> 02:47:44.788 region:rollup2
A LONG ENOUGH SENTENCE FOR THE

02:47:42.886 --> 02:47:45.656 region:rollup2
PERSON TO BENEFIT FROM THIS

02:47:44.788 --> 02:47:46.490 region:rollup2

PERSON WHO SAW WARNING SIGNS AND

02:54:41.604 --> 02:54:45.775 region:rollup2
HAVE CONCERNS. BUT THEY HAD NO

02:54:43.974 --> 02:54:48.311 region:rollup2
LEGAL TOOL TO DISARM.

02:54:45.775 --> 02:54:50.380 region:rollup2
WHEN WE PASS THAT ORIGINAL LAW

02:54:48.311 --> 02:54:52.215 region:rollup2

LAW BEING OVER USED. OR ABUSED.

02:54:55.919 --> 02:54:59.456 region:rollup2
AND OUT OF THAT.

02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:01.157 region:rollup2
THE LAWS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR A

02:54:59.456 --> 02:55:02.859 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF YEARS WE SEE THAT THAT

02:55:01.157 --> 02:55:04.661 region:rollup2
HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE THERE'S

02:55:02.859 --> 02:55:06.663 region:rollup2
ONLY BEEN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND

02:55:04.661 --> 02:55:07.364 region:rollup2

RESTRAINING ORDERS OBTAINED.

02:55:10.433 --> 02:55:13.837 region:rollup2
MOST OF THOSE HAVE BEEN OBTAINED

02:55:12.168 --> 02:55:16.139 region:rollup2
BY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE'RE

02:55:13.837 --> 02:55:18.641 region:rollup2
FINDING THAT FOR FAMILY MEMBERS

02:55:16.139 --> 02:55:21.511 region:rollup2
IT IS A VERY BIG STEP.

02:55:18.641 --> 02:55:23.413 region:rollup2
TO GO TO THE COURT AND AND.

02:55:21.511 --> 02:55:24.914 region:rollup2

TAKE THAT STEP DURING A CRISIS

02:55:31.054 --> 02:55:33.990 region:rollup2
SITUATION THEY'RE CALLING LAW

02:55:32.222 --> 02:55:36.626 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT INSTEAD SO THAT'S

02:55:33.990 --> 02:55:38.728 region:rollup2
HOW. HOW THE LAW IS PLAIN OUR

02:55:36.626 --> 02:55:40.163 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY DOES NOT APPEAR TO

02:55:38.728 --> 02:55:43.066 region:rollup2
BE OVER USED OR ABUSED?

02:55:40.163 --> 02:55:45.568 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THERE ARE TIMES WHEN

02:55:43.066 --> 02:55:48.405 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT MAY NOT BE

02:55:45.568 --> 02:55:50.206 region:rollup2
RESPONSIVE TO A CONCERN AND THAT

02:55:48.405 --> 02:55:52.041 region:rollup2
CONCERN MAY NOT BE FROM FAMILY

02:55:50.206 --> 02:55:53.343 region:rollup2

02:55:52.041 --> 02:55:55.044 region:rollup2
EARLIER. COULD BE.

02:55:53.343 --> 02:55:55.545 region:rollup2

SETTING.

02:55:57.981 --> 02:56:00.917 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT NOW OF COURSE THEY

02:55:59.482 --> 02:56:02.385 region:rollup2
CANNOT PETITION THE COURT THE

02:56:00.917 --> 02:56:03.853 region:rollup2
OTHER THING IS THAT SOME

02:56:02.385 --> 02:56:05.855 region:rollup2
FAMILIES EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A

02:56:03.853 --> 02:56:08.458 region:rollup2
CIVIL ORDER NOT A CRIMINAL

02:56:05.855 --> 02:56:09.826 region:rollup2
PROCEEDING. SOME OUR COMMUNITIES

02:56:08.458 --> 02:56:11.561 region:rollup2
ARE RELUCTANT TO GO TO LAW

02:56:09.826 --> 02:56:12.462 region:rollup2

FAMILY CRISIS OR SITUATION SO

02:56:14.831 --> 02:56:18.868 region:rollup2
WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT.

02:56:17.167 --> 02:56:20.870 region:rollup2
WILLING TO RESPOND OR IS NOT

02:56:18.868 --> 02:56:22.839 region:rollup2
RESPONSIVE AND WHEN THE FAMILY.

02:56:22.839 --> 02:56:26.709 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEMBER IS RELUCTANT TO GO

02:56:24.941 --> 02:56:28.311 region:rollup2
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ODD THEN I

02:56:26.709 --> 02:56:32.415 region:rollup2

03:05:07.063 --> 03:05:09.665 region:rollup2
CLOSE.

03:05:07.964 --> 03:05:11.734 region:rollup2

SO AGAIN I WE WE BELIEVE THAT

03:05:22.912 --> 03:05:26.949 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY SENSIBLE TOO AGAIN AND

03:05:25.081 --> 03:05:28.284 region:rollup2
WE'VE CHOSEN A SMALL TARGETED

03:05:26.949 --> 03:05:29.819 region:rollup2
GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY

03:05:28.284 --> 03:05:30.920 region:rollup2
SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

03:05:29.819 --> 03:05:32.455 region:rollup2
TIME WITH INDIVIDUALS.

03:05:30.920 --> 03:05:34.290 region:rollup2
OKAY THAT I SEE THAT POINT AND.

03:05:32.455 --> 03:05:36.092 region:rollup2

WHERE THEY CAN BE HEARD LIVE

03:05:43.232 --> 03:05:46.636 region:rollup2
MUCH CLOSER TO THAT THAT THE

03:05:45.101 --> 03:05:48.037 region:rollup2
DATE OF THE SEIZURE I THINK

03:05:46.636 --> 03:05:49.205 region:rollup2
INSTANCE TAKES A TEMPORARY

03:05:48.037 --> 03:05:50.239 region:rollup2
SITUATION.

03:05:49.205 --> 03:05:50.806 region:rollup2

EXTEND IT TO YEAR I'M SO ALSO ON

03:06:04.854 --> 03:06:07.723 region:rollup2
THE POINT OF ON THEM IT DOES.

03:06:06.789 --> 03:06:08.724 region:rollup2
THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THIS

AND IT'S JUST SIMPLY THAT A

03:07:33.876 --> 03:07:37.847 region:rollup2
TOOL.

03:07:57.933 --> 03:08:01.971 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE PEOPLE. ARE THERE ANY

03:07:59.769 --> 03:08:02.772 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO PREVENT

03:08:01.971 --> 03:08:04.874 region:rollup2
THIS FROM BEING ABUSED ACROSS

03:08:02.772 --> 03:08:06.108 region:rollup2

A PROCESS IT'S VERY VERY SIMPLE.

03:08:28.330 --> 03:08:31.467 region:rollup2

TO BE A TOOL THAT CAN BE USED TO

03:08:42.244 --> 03:08:45.147 region:rollup2
GET GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF

TRAFFICKING.

03:13:24.526 --> 03:13:27.296 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT ONLY UNNECESSARY AS

03:13:26.261 --> 03:13:29.398 region:rollup2
A JUDGE COULD IMPOSE

03:13:27.296 --> 03:13:30.599 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION UNDER EXISTING LAW

03:13:29.398 --> 03:13:31.700 region:rollup2
BUT IT WILL RISK RESULT IN AN

03:13:30.599 --> 03:13:33.001 region:rollup2
INCREASED BURDEN ON LAW

03:13:31.700 --> 03:13:34.336 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WOULD HAVE

03:13:33.001 --> 03:13:36.338 region:rollup2

03:13:34.336 --> 03:13:38.106 region:rollup2
PAPERWORK. AND TAKE RESOURCES

03:13:36.338 --> 03:13:39.241 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM THE FACT MONITORING OF

THOSE REGISTERED OFFENDERS WHO

03:13:39.241 --> 03:13:41.677 region:rollup2

OFFENDING. WE ASK FOR YOUR NO

BUT I WILL ALSO ASK YOU. TO

03:13:53.755 --> 03:13:59.728 region:rollup2
CONSIDER FIRST ON. THE SEX

03:13:57.326 --> 03:14:02.097 region:rollup2

OVERHAULED LAST YEAR WITH SP

THREE. EIGHTY FOUR AND THAT IS

03:14:04.399 --> 03:14:09.571 region:rollup2
REALLY TOO EARLY TO US CHANGE

03:14:06.668 --> 03:14:11.406 region:rollup2
START CHANGING THE RULES.

03:14:09.571 --> 03:14:12.941 region:rollup2
ALSO I THERE'S NO RESEARCH

03:14:11.406 --> 03:14:15.711 region:rollup2
SHOWING THAT.

03:14:12.941 --> 03:14:18.313 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE.

03:14:15.711 --> 03:14:21.483 region:rollup2
BEEN ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH

03:14:18.313 --> 03:14:24.119 region:rollup2

ATTEMPTED SOLICITATION. ARE AT

03:14:24.119 --> 03:14:28.423 region:rollup2
RISK TO RE OFFEND SO IT'S

03:14:26.021 --> 03:14:31.293 region:rollup2
TARGETING A GROUP. THAT HAS NOT

03:14:28.423 --> 03:14:33.829 region:rollup2
BEEN FOUND BY ANY RESEARCH TO BE

03:14:31.293 --> 03:14:36.198 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE PUT ON THE

03:14:33.829 --> 03:14:38.367 region:rollup2
STE KIND OF LIST IN FACT.

03:14:36.198 --> 03:14:39.935 region:rollup2
THEY ARE IF THERE IS SOME

03:14:38.367 --> 03:14:42.804 region:rollup2
PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE

03:14:39.935 --> 03:14:44.506 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND OF THE INDIVIDUAL.

03:14:42.804 --> 03:14:46.308 region:rollup2
THEN AS THIS YEAR SAID. THEY

03:14:44.506 --> 03:14:49.077 region:rollup2
CAN'T THE JUDGE CAN.

03:14:46.308 --> 03:14:50.078 region:rollup2
REQUIRE REGISTRATION BUT

03:14:49.077 --> 03:14:52.481 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO RESEARCH SO.

03:14:50.078 --> 03:14:54.449 region:rollup2
SHOWING THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS

03:14:52.481 --> 03:14:56.885 region:rollup2
BEEN THEM BAREST AND ARRESTED

03:14:54.449 --> 03:14:57.986 region:rollup2

OFFEND.

03:14:57.986 --> 03:15:02.257 region:rollup2
.

03:14:59.755 --> 03:15:04.793 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING TO CONSIDER IS A

03:15:02.257 --> 03:15:05.627 region:rollup2
BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF

03:15:04.793 --> 03:15:07.462 region:rollup2
PLACING SOMEONE.

03:15:05.627 --> 03:15:09.231 region:rollup2
.

03:15:07.462 --> 03:15:13.001 region:rollup2
THE REGISTRATION EVEN IF.

03:15:09.231 --> 03:15:17.105 region:rollup2
IT'S TIER TWO FOR TWENTY YEARS.

03:15:13.001 --> 03:15:20.008 region:rollup2
YOU ARE ON PUTTING THE FAMILY IN

03:15:17.105 --> 03:15:21.710 region:rollup2
THE POSITION OF BEING SHAMED AND

03:15:20.008 --> 03:15:23.946 region:rollup2
SINGLED OUT THE COMMUNITY.

03:15:21.710 --> 03:15:26.548 region:rollup2
YOU ARE IT ENDANGERS THEIR

03:15:23.946 --> 03:15:27.416 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT WHICH THEN COULD LEAD

03:15:26.548 --> 03:15:30.519 region:rollup2
TO THE.

03:15:27.416 --> 03:15:32.721 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC MARGINALISATION OF THE

03:15:30.519 --> 03:15:35.090 region:rollup2
ENTIRE FAMILY.

03:15:32.721 --> 03:15:36.758 region:rollup2
IT.

03:15:35.090 --> 03:15:38.794 region:rollup2
FOR CLOSES MANY OPPORTUNITIES IN

03:15:36.758 --> 03:15:41.296 region:rollup2
LIFE.

03:15:38.794 --> 03:15:42.831 region:rollup2
THAT ON THEM YOU NEVER EVER GET

03:15:41.296 --> 03:15:44.433 region:rollup2
BACK.

03:15:42.831 --> 03:15:46.802 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T THINK.

03:15:44.433 --> 03:15:48.537 region:rollup2

03:15:52.808 --> 03:15:56.445 region:rollup2
ARE THERE QUESTIONS FROM

03:15:53.308 --> 03:15:57.079 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

03:15:56.445 --> 03:15:58.714 region:rollup2
YOU MAY CLOSE WITH CUNNINGHAM

03:15:57.079 --> 03:15:59.982 region:rollup2
THANK YOU I'D JUST. LIKE TO

03:15:58.714 --> 03:16:01.883 region:rollup2
ADDRESS BRIEFLY A COUPLE THE

03:15:59.982 --> 03:16:02.951 region:rollup2
ISSUES RAISED I ACTUALLY THINK

03:16:01.883 --> 03:16:04.753 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TEARS THE

03:16:02.951 --> 03:16:06.288 region:rollup2
SYSTEM NOW. IS.

03:16:04.753 --> 03:16:07.689 region:rollup2
THE VERY REASON THIS BILLS.

03:16:06.288 --> 03:16:09.191 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

03:16:07.689 --> 03:16:10.626 region:rollup2
AND MY CONCERN THE BILL IS THE

03:16:09.191 --> 03:16:12.160 region:rollup2
CHAIR KNOWS LAST YEAR BUT I

03:16:10.626 --> 03:16:13.895 region:rollup2
DIDN'T FEEL THAT IT WAS.

03:16:12.160 --> 03:16:15.664 region:rollup2
A PRUDENT BECAUSE OF THE

03:16:13.895 --> 03:16:17.399 region:rollup2
LIFETIME REGISTRATION NATURE OF

03:16:15.664 --> 03:16:19.635 region:rollup2
THE PRIOR SYSTEM BUT NOW THAT WE

03:16:17.399 --> 03:16:19.835 region:rollup2
HAVE A TIERED SYSTEM I THINK.

03:16:19.635 --> 03:16:21.403 region:rollup2
IT'S.

03:16:19.835 --> 03:16:23.171 region:rollup2
A REASONABLE.

03:16:21.403 --> 03:16:23.739 region:rollup2
MEASURE BECAUSE NOW TO TIER TWO

03:16:23.171 --> 03:16:26.174 region:rollup2
NOT A LIFETIME REGISTRATION

03:16:23.739 --> 03:16:26.775 region:rollup2
IT'S.

03:16:26.174 --> 03:16:27.776 region:rollup2
WE WE'VE SORT OF OVER ALL THAT

03:16:26.775 --> 03:16:29.511 region:rollup2
AND.

03:16:27.776 --> 03:16:31.580 region:rollup2
WAS GENERALLY VIEWED AS A MORE

03:16:29.511 --> 03:16:31.880 region:rollup2
MANAGEABLE WAY I THINK THIS TYPE

03:16:31.580 --> 03:16:33.348 region:rollup2
OF OFFENSES.

03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:34.583 region:rollup2
.

03:16:33.348 --> 03:16:36.351 region:rollup2
A PERFECT CANDIDATE TO ADD TO

03:16:34.583 --> 03:16:38.186 region:rollup2
THE TO THE TIER TWO I THINK NOW

03:16:36.351 --> 03:16:39.454 region:rollup2
THAT WE GOT THAT OUT OF THE WAY.

03:16:38.186 --> 03:16:41.156 region:rollup2
WE CAN START LOOKING AT SOME OF

03:16:39.454 --> 03:16:43.759 region:rollup2
THE GAPS IN OUR LAWS THAT ARE

03:16:41.156 --> 03:16:44.526 region:rollup2
MEANT TO. OF PROTECT FAMILIES

03:16:43.759 --> 03:16:46.695 region:rollup2
AND CHILDREN AND.

03:16:44.526 --> 03:16:47.896 region:rollup2
AGAIN THIS BILL THAT DOES NOT

03:16:46.695 --> 03:16:49.031 region:rollup2
APPLY TO PROSTITUTES THIS IS

03:16:47.896 --> 03:16:51.433 region:rollup2
JOHN'S THIS THESE ARE PEOPLE

03:16:49.031 --> 03:16:53.268 region:rollup2
SOLICITING. AND THE VICTIMS IN

03:16:51.433 --> 03:16:54.703 region:rollup2
ORDER TO QUALIFY YOU FOR UNDER

03:16:53.268 --> 03:16:56.204 region:rollup2

ALUMINUM.

03:25:46.734 --> 03:25:51.139 region:rollup2
WHICH COULD BE CONSIDERED UNDER

THIS BILL AS A PRECURSOR PART.

03:25:51.139 --> 03:25:53.575 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE THE

MADE INTO A FIREARM.

03:26:09.190 --> 03:26:12.894 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY FOR PRIVATE PEOPLE

03:26:11.092 --> 03:26:14.362 region:rollup2
TO MAKE PRIVATE FIREARMS HAS

03:26:12.894 --> 03:26:16.431 region:rollup2
BEEN WITH US SINCE UNITED STATES

BEEN HERE THE VERY FEW CASES

03:26:25.607 --> 03:26:29.244 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP WARY.

03:26:27.442 --> 03:26:30.178 region:rollup2
GHOST GUN HAS BEEN USED IN THE

03:26:29.244 --> 03:26:32.347 region:rollup2
COMMISSION OF A CRIME AND THE

03:26:30.178 --> 03:26:33.881 region:rollup2
FACT THAT.

03:26:32.347 --> 03:26:35.583 region:rollup2
A VERY SMALL POSITION UP.

03:26:33.881 --> 03:26:37.418 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF ALL CRIMES ARE

03:26:35.583 --> 03:26:39.487 region:rollup2
COMMITTED WITH LONG GUNS.

03:26:37.418 --> 03:26:40.922 region:rollup2
WOULD. INDICATE THAT THIS BILL

03:26:39.487 --> 03:26:41.422 region:rollup2
IS NOT REALLY NECESSARY IN IS

03:26:40.922 --> 03:26:42.657 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO ACCOMPLISH

03:26:41.422 --> 03:26:44.492 region:rollup2
ANYTHING.

03:26:42.657 --> 03:26:46.728 region:rollup2
IF THE PEOPLE WHO COMMITTED

03:26:44.492 --> 03:26:48.096 region:rollup2
THESE CRIMES ARE ABLE TO TO BILL

03:26:46.728 --> 03:26:50.198 region:rollup2
GUNS FROM GOES GUNS THEY'RE

03:26:48.096 --> 03:26:51.399 region:rollup2

03:26:52.800 --> 03:26:54.569 region:rollup2
IN FROM OTHER STATES ARE GOING

03:26:53.401 --> 03:26:56.104 region:rollup2
TO.

03:26:54.569 --> 03:26:58.039 region:rollup2
IT IS IT'S NOT AN ISSUE THIS IS

03:26:56.104 --> 03:27:00.174 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO PREVENT ONE SINGLE

03:26:58.039 --> 03:27:02.076 region:rollup2
DEATH FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE.

03:27:00.174 --> 03:27:03.044 region:rollup2
IN STRONG OPPOSITION.

03:27:02.076 --> 03:27:04.412 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE

ASSOCIATION WE'RE HERE IN STRONG

03:27:06.247 --> 03:27:09.584 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

03:27:07.715 --> 03:27:10.084 region:rollup2
THIS BILLS INCREDIBLY OVERBROAD

03:27:09.584 --> 03:27:11.586 region:rollup2
AS MY COLLEAGUE STATED.

03:27:10.084 --> 03:27:13.354 region:rollup2
.

03:27:11.586 --> 03:27:15.089 region:rollup2
I KNOW THE INTENT OF THIS IS TO.

03:27:13.354 --> 03:27:16.658 region:rollup2
FURTHER THAT THE SO CALLED

03:27:15.089 --> 03:27:18.059 region:rollup2
GHOST GUN LAW OR THE UNFINISHED

03:27:16.658 --> 03:27:20.228 region:rollup2
FRAMES AND RECEIVERS.

03:27:18.059 --> 03:27:20.795 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WAS NOT EVEN BEEN FULLY

03:27:20.228 --> 03:27:22.230 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED RIGHT NOW WE'RE

03:27:20.795 --> 03:27:23.631 region:rollup2
STILL.

03:27:22.230 --> 03:27:24.299 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH THE REGULATIONS

03:27:23.631 --> 03:27:25.466 region:rollup2
WERE SO GOING THROUGH THE

03:27:24.299 --> 03:27:27.502 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF EVEN SEEING HOW

03:27:25.466 --> 03:27:29.137 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO BE ENFORCED.

03:27:27.502 --> 03:27:30.471 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

03:27:29.137 --> 03:27:31.940 region:rollup2
HERE I ARE NOT FIREARMS THE

03:27:30.471 --> 03:27:33.574 region:rollup2
PRECURSOR PARTS THEIR THEIR

03:27:31.940 --> 03:27:35.376 region:rollup2
CONSUMABLES

03:27:33.574 --> 03:27:38.146 region:rollup2
THERE'RE THERE'RE. ITEMS ON

03:27:35.376 --> 03:27:39.514 region:rollup2
FIREARMS DAY NEED REPLACING THAT

03:27:38.146 --> 03:27:41.149 region:rollup2
ARE OFTEN UPGRADE IT.

03:27:39.514 --> 03:27:42.483 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE NOT FIREARMS

03:27:41.149 --> 03:27:43.985 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT TREATED LIKE

03:27:42.483 --> 03:27:45.320 region:rollup2
FIREARMS ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY

03:27:43.985 --> 03:27:46.654 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS A REASON WHY

03:27:45.320 --> 03:27:49.490 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT TREATED AS FIREARMS.

03:27:46.654 --> 03:27:50.858 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT

03:27:49.490 --> 03:27:52.527 region:rollup2
IS A FRAME THAT'S WOOD FRAMES

03:27:50.858 --> 03:27:54.062 region:rollup2
ARE TREATED AS FARMS BECAUSE IF

03:27:52.527 --> 03:27:55.163 region:rollup2
THEY'RE INTERTWINED REALIZE IT

03:27:54.062 --> 03:27:56.631 region:rollup2
PARTS ARE IN RECALL BUT AGAIN

03:27:55.163 --> 03:27:58.266 region:rollup2
THERE A CAN THESE ARE PARTS OR

03:27:56.631 --> 03:28:00.201 region:rollup2
CONSUMABLES THAT. THAT BREAK

03:27:58.266 --> 03:28:01.703 region:rollup2
THAT NEED REPLACING AS I

03:28:00.201 --> 03:28:03.705 region:rollup2
MENTIONED EARLIER.

03:28:01.703 --> 03:28:05.139 region:rollup2
AND THIS WHICH IS CREATING

03:28:03.705 --> 03:28:07.241 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT NINE.

03:28:05.139 --> 03:28:07.909 region:rollup2
RIGHT I MEAN HOW DO YOU IN FOR

03:28:07.241 --> 03:28:09.143 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHEN YOU'RE

03:28:07.909 --> 03:28:09.978 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT BARRELS TRIGGER

03:28:09.143 --> 03:28:12.280 region:rollup2

03:28:12.280 --> 03:28:15.116 region:rollup2
MAGAZINES EXETER AT THESE ARE

03:28:13.948 --> 03:28:16.751 region:rollup2
THESE ARE PARTS THAT IN SOME

03:28:15.116 --> 03:28:18.186 region:rollup2
CASES ARE.

03:28:16.751 --> 03:28:19.921 region:rollup2
PUT ON ATTACHED WILL FIRE HOW DO

03:28:18.186 --> 03:28:22.056 region:rollup2
YOU HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE

EVER COMPLIED WITH. WITH THIS

03:28:22.056 --> 03:28:24.926 region:rollup2
LAW THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

03:28:23.291 --> 03:28:25.393 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THE AMMUNITION

03:28:24.926 --> 03:28:26.761 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND CHECK IS MY

BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED IT HAS.

03:28:31.766 --> 03:28:35.036 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING TO

03:28:33.668 --> 03:28:36.471 region:rollup2
SEE HOW THAT ACTUALLY PLAYS OUT

03:28:35.036 --> 03:28:37.772 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE ACTUALLY DO SEE

03:28:36.471 --> 03:28:38.973 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS ON HOW THAT ACTS.

03:28:37.772 --> 03:28:40.775 region:rollup2
THAT BACKGROUND CHECK WILL.

03:28:38.973 --> 03:28:41.709 region:rollup2
WILL WORK IN REAL LIFE FOR THIS

03:28:40.775 --> 03:28:42.910 region:rollup2
IN A HOST OF OTHER REASONS THAT

03:28:41.709 --> 03:28:45.246 region:rollup2
WE STAND IN STRONG OPPOSITION

03:46:50.363 --> 03:46:54.534 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY. AS WE LIVE IN A TIME

03:46:52.499 --> 03:46:55.035 region:rollup2
IN WHICH SOCIAL MEDIA SHARE SO

03:46:54.534 --> 03:46:56.536 region:rollup2

03:46:55.035 --> 03:46:57.938 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY.

03:46:56.536 --> 03:46:59.606 region:rollup2
I THINK IF WE ARE TO ADDRESS

03:46:57.938 --> 03:47:01.441 region:rollup2

WHICH WE HELP OFFICERS VERY VERY

03:47:09.049 --> 03:47:12.619 region:rollup2
EARLY ON.

03:47:10.417 --> 03:47:14.354 region:rollup2
THIS IS A THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY

03:47:12.619 --> 03:47:16.356 region:rollup2
THAT ONE COMMUNITY SAYS.

03:47:14.354 --> 03:47:17.390 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OFFICERS

ARE TRAINED THAT THEY HAVE THE

03:47:17.390 --> 03:47:21.561 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND RESOURCES THAT

03:47:19.392 --> 03:47:23.163 region:rollup2

INSTEAD.

04:00:09.629 --> 04:00:12.265 region:rollup2
A PROGRAM WILL LOOK LIKE A

04:00:10.963 --> 04:00:13.866 region:rollup2
FAILURE SIMPLY BECAUSE DATA

04:00:12.265 --> 04:00:16.035 region:rollup2

MAKING SURE.

04:01:35.881 --> 04:01:39.418 region:rollup2

JUDGEMENT ON ON THESE PROGRAMS

04:01:44.824 --> 04:01:48.260 region:rollup2
OF AN INCIDENT NICER BUT

04:01:46.225 --> 04:01:50.029 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT MAY HAPPEN.

04:01:48.260 --> 04:01:52.531 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS BROUGHT UP TO ME WHERE

04:01:50.029 --> 04:01:54.166 region:rollup2

04:01:59.005 --> 04:02:03.109 region:rollup2
USED TO COLLOQUIAL THE SHOCK

04:02:00.439 --> 04:02:04.410 region:rollup2
COLLAR DECIDES HE DIDN'T WANT.

04:02:03.109 --> 04:02:05.444 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE TO SHOW UP FOR WEEKS

04:02:04.410 --> 04:02:07.680 region:rollup2
AT A TIME.

04:02:05.444 --> 04:02:09.348 region:rollup2
IT MAY LOOK LIKE.

04:02:07.680 --> 04:02:09.882 region:rollup2
A PROGRAM TO FAILURE BECAUSE

04:02:09.348 --> 04:02:11.217 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DIDN'T COMPLETE THE

04:02:09.882 --> 04:02:12.551 region:rollup2
COURSES.

04:02:11.217 --> 04:02:14.286 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WAS A RESULT OF

04:02:12.551 --> 04:02:15.287 region:rollup2
SOMETHING INTERNAL.

04:02:14.286 --> 04:02:16.956 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE SYSTEM WHICH IS A

04:02:15.287 --> 04:02:19.291 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CULTURE.

04:02:16.956 --> 04:02:21.026 region:rollup2
THEN OUTSIDE OUR SYSTEM AND TO

04:02:23.295 --> 04:02:26.298 region:rollup2
IMPRISON.

04:02:25.331 --> 04:02:28.067 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WE GET ACCURATE

04:02:26.298 --> 04:02:28.367 region:rollup2
INFORMATION LIKE AND I BELIEVE

04:02:28.067 --> 04:02:29.769 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT.

04:02:28.367 --> 04:02:31.837 region:rollup2
.

04:02:29.769 --> 04:02:32.972 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO WORK WITHIN THE

04:02:31.837 --> 04:02:35.041 region:rollup2
FACILITY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

04:02:32.972 --> 04:02:36.542 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT

04:02:35.041 --> 04:02:38.878 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE PRISON WARDEN.

04:02:36.542 --> 04:02:41.180 region:rollup2
TO EVALUATE IT SO THAT YOU YOU

04:02:38.878 --> 04:02:44.183 region:rollup2
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETHING

04:02:41.180 --> 04:02:44.650 region:rollup2
EXTRAORDINARY THAT WE.

04:02:44.183 --> 04:02:46.452 region:rollup2
WOULD EVEN THINK ABOUT

04:02:44.650 --> 04:02:47.920 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

04:02:46.452 --> 04:02:50.656 region:rollup2
OF MIGHT HAVE A JOB A A

04:02:47.920 --> 04:02:52.291 region:rollup2
DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON THAT. ON

04:02:50.656 --> 04:02:54.360 region:rollup2

04:03:06.972 --> 04:03:09.108 region:rollup2

04:04:41.233 --> 04:04:43.869 region:rollup2
THIS BILL COMES FROM THE

04:04:42.234 --> 04:04:45.771 region:rollup2
DEVASTATING STORY.

04:04:43.869 --> 04:04:47.840 region:rollup2
OF AN EIGHT YEAR OLD.

04:04:45.771 --> 04:04:48.807 region:rollup2
GABRIEL FERNANDES A PALM DEL WHO

04:04:47.840 --> 04:04:51.143 region:rollup2
WAS BRUTALLY BEATEN. AND

04:04:48.807 --> 04:04:53.846 region:rollup2
TORTURED.

04:04:51.143 --> 04:04:54.747 region:rollup2
BY HIS MOTHER AND BOYFRIEND.

04:04:53.846 --> 04:04:56.448 region:rollup2
SEVERAL DIFFERENT CALLS WERE

04:04:54.747 --> 04:04:57.516 region:rollup2
MADE TO BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

04:04:56.448 --> 04:04:59.218 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILD AND

04:04:57.516 --> 04:05:01.086 region:rollup2
FAMILY SERVICES.

04:04:59.218 --> 04:05:03.355 region:rollup2
AND SOMEHOW GABRIEL STILL FELL

04:05:01.086 --> 04:05:05.191 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE CRACKS.

04:05:03.355 --> 04:05:06.492 region:rollup2
THIS UNFORTUNATE HAPPENSTANCE IS

04:05:05.191 --> 04:05:08.427 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT IS NOT

04:05:06.492 --> 04:05:09.295 region:rollup2
UNCOMMON TODAY.

04:05:08.427 --> 04:05:10.829 region:rollup2
AND ESPECIALLY MOST

04:05:09.295 --> 04:05:11.964 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED REGIONS WITH MANY

04:05:10.829 --> 04:05:13.999 region:rollup2
CHILDREN MOVING IN AND OUT OF

04:05:11.964 --> 04:05:15.568 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

04:05:13.999 --> 04:05:16.602 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING THIS CASE THE LOS

04:05:15.568 --> 04:05:18.203 region:rollup2
ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF

04:05:16.602 --> 04:05:19.872 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS AUTHORIZED A BLUE

04:05:18.203 --> 04:05:20.706 region:rollup2
RIBBON COMMISSION. TO RECOMMEND

04:05:19.872 --> 04:05:23.142 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS FOR HANDLING THESE

04:05:20.706 --> 04:05:24.944 region:rollup2
CASES.

04:05:23.142 --> 04:05:27.046 region:rollup2
FROM THAT COMMISSION CAN THE LOS

04:05:24.944 --> 04:05:29.648 region:rollup2
ANGELES COUNTY ONLINE DATABASE

04:05:27.046 --> 04:05:30.716 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO AS EAST CARS.

04:05:29.648 --> 04:05:32.551 region:rollup2
WHICH MAKES THE CURRENTLY

04:05:30.716 --> 04:05:33.652 region:rollup2
MANDATED FORM THAT MUST BE

04:05:32.551 --> 04:05:36.889 region:rollup2
FILLED OUT UPON INTAKE OF AN

04:05:33.652 --> 04:05:38.090 region:rollup2
ALLEGED CHILD ABUSE ELECTRONIC.

04:05:36.889 --> 04:05:40.192 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH

04:05:38.090 --> 04:05:42.394 region:rollup2
FOLKS IN LOS ANGELES.

04:05:40.192 --> 04:05:43.896 region:rollup2
WORKING ON THAT EACH CAR SYSTEM.

04:05:42.394 --> 04:05:45.030 region:rollup2
AND THEY COULD NOT STRESS ENOUGH

04:05:43.896 --> 04:05:47.132 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR

04:05:45.030 --> 04:05:49.201 region:rollup2
ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SHARING.

04:05:47.132 --> 04:05:49.768 region:rollup2
AND HOW IT IS TRANSFORMED.

04:05:49.201 --> 04:05:50.703 region:rollup2
THE WAY AGENCIES COMMUNICATE

04:05:49.768 --> 04:05:52.037 region:rollup2
WITH

04:05:50.703 --> 04:05:53.505 region:rollup2
EACH OTHER WHEN DEALING WITH

04:05:52.037 --> 04:05:55.808 region:rollup2
THESE CASES OF CHILD ABUSE AND

04:05:53.505 --> 04:05:57.476 region:rollup2
NEGLECT.

04:05:55.808 --> 04:05:59.845 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS

04:05:57.476 --> 04:06:01.180 region:rollup2
DATABASE IS NOT AND I EMPHASIZE

04:05:59.845 --> 04:06:02.881 region:rollup2
IS NOT A LAW ENFORCEMENT

04:06:01.180 --> 04:06:04.183 region:rollup2
DATABASE.

04:06:02.881 --> 04:06:06.352 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT SIMILAR TO CAL

04:06:04.183 --> 04:06:08.120 region:rollup2
GAINES.

04:06:06.352 --> 04:06:09.855 region:rollup2
THIS IS A DEPARTMENT OF CHILD

04:06:08.120 --> 04:06:12.424 region:rollup2
AND FAMILY SERVICES DATABASE

04:06:09.855 --> 04:06:14.226 region:rollup2
THAT IS VERY SPECIFIC.

04:06:12.424 --> 04:06:16.228 region:rollup2
THAT IS WHERE ONLY SPECIFIC

04:06:14.226 --> 04:06:18.464 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED BUT PEOPLE IN LAW

04:06:16.228 --> 04:06:19.531 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT HAVE ACCESS TO.

04:06:18.464 --> 04:06:20.699 region:rollup2
I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME

04:06:19.531 --> 04:06:22.701 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT THELACK OF

04:06:20.699 --> 04:06:23.836 region:rollup2
NOTIFICATION THAT WOULD GO. TO

04:06:22.701 --> 04:06:26.705 region:rollup2
THE PARENTS OF SUSPECTED CHILD

04:06:23.836 --> 04:06:27.773 region:rollup2
ABUSE OR NEGLECT.

04:06:26.705 --> 04:06:29.241 region:rollup2
BUT IT AS A DISTRO WITHIN

04:06:27.773 --> 04:06:31.243 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION.

04:06:29.241 --> 04:06:33.879 region:rollup2
ALERTING SUSPECTS UNDOUBTEDLY

04:06:31.243 --> 04:06:35.114 region:rollup2
ALTERS DETERMINING TRUTH.

04:06:33.879 --> 04:06:37.182 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THE CONCERNS ARE COMING

04:06:35.114 --> 04:06:38.417 region:rollup2
FROM THE SIDE. OF THOSE WORRIED

04:06:37.182 --> 04:06:39.918 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN

04:06:38.417 --> 04:06:42.021 region:rollup2
INSTANCES WHEN ALLEGATIONS ARE

04:06:39.918 --> 04:06:43.455 region:rollup2
UNSUBSTANTIATED AND THE DUE

04:06:42.021 --> 04:06:45.557 region:rollup2
PROCESS FOR REMOVAL OF THE

04:06:43.455 --> 04:06:47.059 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION.

04:06:45.557 --> 04:06:49.061 region:rollup2
WHEN WE FOCUS SOLELY ON THAT

04:06:47.059 --> 04:06:49.561 region:rollup2
ASPECT WE MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY

04:06:49.061 --> 04:06:50.829 region:rollup2
TO OFFER THE HELP THESE

04:06:49.561 --> 04:06:54.333 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

04:06:50.829 --> 04:06:55.267 region:rollup2
WHO ARE BEING ABUSED?

04:06:54.333 --> 04:06:56.969 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALREADY SAFEGUARDS IN

04:06:55.267 --> 04:06:58.203 region:rollup2
PLACE IS THIS MANDATED PAPER

04:06:56.969 --> 04:07:00.272 region:rollup2
FORM HAS BEEN STATUTE FOR MANY

04:06:58.203 --> 04:07:01.340 region:rollup2
YEARS.

04:07:00.272 --> 04:07:02.741 region:rollup2
THIS BILL UPDATES THE REPORTING

04:07:01.340 --> 04:07:04.076 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT TO TRANSMIT

04:07:02.741 --> 04:07:05.978 region:rollup2
INFORMATION MORE QUICKLY MORE

04:07:04.076 --> 04:07:08.414 region:rollup2
EFFICIENTLY.

04:07:05.978 --> 04:07:10.883 region:rollup2
BY USING TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY.

04:07:08.414 --> 04:07:11.250 region:rollup2
AND.

04:07:10.883 --> 04:07:13.218 region:rollup2
I.

04:07:11.250 --> 04:07:14.253 region:rollup2
I HAD SOMEONE HERE TO TESTIFY

04:07:13.218 --> 04:07:15.721 region:rollup2
WITH ME TODAY WITHOUT A MEDICAL

04:07:14.253 --> 04:07:16.522 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY.

04:07:15.721 --> 04:07:19.091 region:rollup2
AND SO.

04:07:16.522 --> 04:07:22.861 region:rollup2
THEY WILL BE UNABLE TO TESTIFY

04:07:19.091 --> 04:07:23.429 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.

04:07:22.861 --> 04:07:25.464 region:rollup2
UNDER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

04:07:23.429 --> 04:07:26.665 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

04:07:25.464 --> 04:07:38.777 region:rollup2
ARE ANY WITNESSES IN.

04:07:26.665 --> 04:07:41.180 region:rollup2
POSITION.

04:07:38.777 --> 04:07:42.514 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON.

04:07:41.180 --> 04:07:44.750 region:rollup2
CATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF

04:07:42.514 --> 04:07:46.785 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE RESPECTFULLY MUST

04:07:44.750 --> 04:07:48.253 region:rollup2
OPPOSE AB NINETEEN ELEVEN.

04:07:46.785 --> 04:07:49.455 region:rollup2
I WANT TO START BY KNOWLEDGE AND

04:07:48.253 --> 04:07:51.523 region:rollup2
THE TRAGEDY OF THE DEATHS OF

04:07:49.455 --> 04:07:53.592 region:rollup2
GABRIEL FERNANDEZ THIS WAS OF

04:07:51.523 --> 04:07:55.027 region:rollup2
COURSE A TRAGIC EVENT AND AND WE

04:07:53.592 --> 04:07:56.628 region:rollup2
WANT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

04:07:55.027 --> 04:07:58.597 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT IF THERE ARE WAYS

04:07:56.628 --> 04:07:59.164 region:rollup2
THAT THE. THE STATE CAN BETTER

04:07:58.597 --> 04:08:00.599 region:rollup2
PROTECT ITS CHILDREN IN THE

04:07:59.164 --> 04:08:01.900 region:rollup2
FUTURE.

04:08:00.599 --> 04:08:03.202 region:rollup2
BUT THE CHANGES PROPOSED IN

04:08:01.900 --> 04:08:05.337 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ELEVEN WOULD

04:08:03.202 --> 04:08:07.139 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE PREVENTED GABRIEL STAFF

04:08:05.337 --> 04:08:09.108 region:rollup2
WHICH HAPPENED AFTER ALLEGATIONS

04:08:07.139 --> 04:08:10.876 region:rollup2
OF ABUSE HAD BEEN INVESTIGATED

04:08:09.108 --> 04:08:12.444 region:rollup2
AND DETERMINED TO BE UNFOUNDED.

04:08:10.876 --> 04:08:14.146 region:rollup2
AND HAPPENED IN LOS ANGELES

04:08:12.444 --> 04:08:16.081 region:rollup2
COUNTY WHERE THEY ALREADY HAD AN

04:08:14.146 --> 04:08:16.648 region:rollup2
ONLINE DATABASE SUCH SUCH AS

04:08:16.081 --> 04:08:18.584 region:rollup2
WOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER THIS

04:08:16.648 --> 04:08:20.085 region:rollup2
BILL.

04:08:18.584 --> 04:08:21.420 region:rollup2
AB NINETEEN ELEVEN PROPOSES

04:08:20.085 --> 04:08:22.988 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT WOULD PUT ALL

04:08:21.420 --> 04:08:24.690 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS AT RISK OF HAVING

04:08:22.988 --> 04:08:25.858 region:rollup2
CHILD ABUSE OF ALLEGATIONS

04:08:24.690 --> 04:08:28.026 region:rollup2
AGAINST THEM ENTERED INTO A

04:08:25.858 --> 04:08:29.328 region:rollup2
DATABASE. WITH LITTLE OR NO

04:08:28.026 --> 04:08:30.963 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT AS TO HOW THE

04:08:29.328 --> 04:08:33.332 region:rollup2
INFORMATION CAN BE ACCESSED WERE

04:08:30.963 --> 04:08:34.867 region:rollup2
USED AND WITH UNDEFINED EXCUSE

04:08:33.332 --> 04:08:36.602 region:rollup2
ME UNDEFINED STANDARDS AND

04:08:34.867 --> 04:08:38.437 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES FOR THE REMOVAL OF

04:08:36.602 --> 04:08:40.739 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WHEN IT IS FOUND TO

04:08:38.437 --> 04:08:42.141 region:rollup2
BE UNSUBSTANTIATED.

04:08:40.739 --> 04:08:43.909 region:rollup2
THE CREATION OF AN A GOVERNMENT

04:08:42.141 --> 04:08:45.511 region:rollup2
DATABASE TO COLLECT UNTESTED

04:08:43.909 --> 04:08:47.980 region:rollup2
ACCUSATIONS OF IT IS TO BE DONE

04:08:45.511 --> 04:08:50.015 region:rollup2
AT ALL. REQUIRES THE UTMOST CARE

04:08:47.980 --> 04:08:51.550 region:rollup2
IN SETTING STANDARDS AS TO HOW

04:08:50.015 --> 04:08:53.118 region:rollup2
THE INFORMATION COMES TO BE

04:08:51.550 --> 04:08:55.521 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN THE DATABASE.

04:08:53.118 --> 04:08:56.889 region:rollup2
HOW THE INFORMATION MAY BE USED?

04:08:55.521 --> 04:08:58.590 region:rollup2
WHEN IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE

04:08:56.889 --> 04:09:00.225 region:rollup2
RETAINED AND WHAT THE PROCEDURES

04:08:58.590 --> 04:09:02.161 region:rollup2
ARE FOR CHALLENGING THE

04:09:00.225 --> 04:09:03.662 region:rollup2
INCLUSION OF THE INFORMATION.

04:09:02.161 --> 04:09:04.830 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN THE TYPES OF ABUSES

04:09:03.662 --> 04:09:06.999 region:rollup2
THAT THAT OCCUR WHEN SUCH

04:09:04.830 --> 04:09:08.167 region:rollup2
STANDARDS ARE NOT EXPRESSLY LAID

04:09:06.999 --> 04:09:09.835 region:rollup2
OUT WE'VE SEEN IT WITH THE

04:09:08.167 --> 04:09:11.170 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE CHILD ABUSE CENTRAL

04:09:09.835 --> 04:09:13.205 region:rollup2
INDEX WHICH FOR MANY YEARS

04:09:11.170 --> 04:09:14.640 region:rollup2
INCLUDED THE NAMES. OF MANY

04:09:13.205 --> 04:09:16.074 region:rollup2
WRONGFULLY ACCUSED PEOPLE AND

04:09:14.640 --> 04:09:17.543 region:rollup2
GAVE THEM NO WAY TO GET THEIR

04:09:16.074 --> 04:09:18.644 region:rollup2
NAMES OFF THE LIST.

04:09:17.543 --> 04:09:20.379 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN IT WITH CAL GANG

04:09:18.644 --> 04:09:22.047 region:rollup2
WHICH ALSO KEPT INFORMATION ON

04:09:20.379 --> 04:09:23.482 region:rollup2
PERSONS WHO DID NOT BELONG IN

04:09:22.047 --> 04:09:24.783 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM.

04:09:23.482 --> 04:09:26.118 region:rollup2
AND WHICH ALLOW THE INFORMATION

04:09:24.783 --> 04:09:28.120 region:rollup2
TO BE USED IN WAYS THAT WERE NOT

04:09:26.118 --> 04:09:30.055 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZED.

04:09:28.120 --> 04:09:31.890 region:rollup2
YET AB NINETEEN ELEVEN REQUIRES

04:09:30.055 --> 04:09:32.825 region:rollup2
EACH OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT

04:09:31.890 --> 04:09:34.493 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO SET UP SUCH A

04:09:32.825 --> 04:09:35.928 region:rollup2
DATABASE.

04:09:34.493 --> 04:09:37.696 region:rollup2
AND FOR THE MOST PART LETS THEM

04:09:35.928 --> 04:09:39.431 region:rollup2
SET THEIR OWN STANDARDS AT FOR

04:09:37.696 --> 04:09:41.300 region:rollup2
HOW THEY WILL OPERATE.

04:09:39.431 --> 04:09:43.035 region:rollup2
THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE INDEED

04:09:41.300 --> 04:09:45.037 region:rollup2
THE LIKELIHOOD OF WIDESPREAD

04:09:43.035 --> 04:09:46.872 region:rollup2
ABUSE IS CLEAR.

04:09:45.037 --> 04:09:47.539 region:rollup2
WE ASK YOU TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS

04:09:46.872 --> 04:09:50.509 region:rollup2
OF ALL CALIFORNIANS BY VOTING NO

04:09:47.539 --> 04:09:52.377 region:rollup2
ON THIS.

04:09:50.509 --> 04:09:54.313 region:rollup2
THANK YOU HER INDIA.

04:09:52.377 --> 04:09:55.814 region:rollup2
MISTER TREMORS ON I'M HERE IN

04:09:54.313 --> 04:09:57.149 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS POSITION JOIN OF OR

04:09:55.814 --> 04:09:58.083 region:rollup2
SOME GAP THE URBAN COUNTIES OF

04:09:57.149 --> 04:09:59.084 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ALSO HERE ON BEHALF

04:09:58.083 --> 04:10:00.352 region:rollup2
OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS.

04:09:59.084 --> 04:10:01.954 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION WE HAVE BEEN HAD

04:10:00.352 --> 04:10:03.589 region:rollup2
MEETINGS WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF

04:10:01.954 --> 04:10:05.457 region:rollup2
THE SPONSORS OF THE BELL. MOM

04:10:03.589 --> 04:10:06.859 region:rollup2
AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT

04:10:05.457 --> 04:10:08.594 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION LOS ANGELES COUNTY

04:10:06.859 --> 04:10:09.962 region:rollup2
WHICH WHICH IF WE HOPE DOESN'T

04:10:08.594 --> 04:10:11.463 region:rollup2
HAPPEN OTHER KINDS THAT WE KNOW

04:10:09.962 --> 04:10:14.199 region:rollup2
DOES HAPPEN SOMETIMES.

04:10:11.463 --> 04:10:15.200 region:rollup2
BUT OUR ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT.

04:10:14.199 --> 04:10:16.935 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THIS IS COSTLY

04:10:15.200 --> 04:10:17.936 region:rollup2
INEFFECTIVE IT WOULD ASK EACH

04:10:16.935 --> 04:10:19.137 region:rollup2
COUNTY TO CREATE A BRAND NEW

04:10:17.936 --> 04:10:20.873 region:rollup2
DATABASE YOU ALREADY HAVE
