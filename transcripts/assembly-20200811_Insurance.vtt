RESPECTFULLY WE ARE IN

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.691
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL BUT IT'S

01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:56.659
WITH THE NEW ONES I THINK A LOT

01:09:56.725 --> 01:09:58.127
OF A LOT LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER

01:09:58.193 --> 01:09:59.461
FOLKS WHO SPOKE- WE'RE NOT

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:01.897

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:02.531
ELEVEN FIFTY NINE TODAY I WANNA

01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:04.567
MAKE THAT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR- ARE

01:10:04.633 --> 01:10:06.135
OPPOSITION THAT SPOKE WITH

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:07.269
FOCUSED MAINLY ON SECTION

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:09.705
THREE- IN TERMS OF SECTIONS ONE

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:11.307
INTO SECTION ONE- THE

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:12.441
CODIFICATION OF THE EXECUTIVE

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:14.243
ORDER- WE'RE TOTALLY FINE WITH

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:16.278

FORWARD FACING PRESUMPTION FOR

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:19.315
SOME POLICE FIRE AND HEALTH

CARE WORKERS. I HAD A LINE'S

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:22.251
PRETTY CLOSELY WITH WHAT WAS

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:23.819
DONE IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER.

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.521
THERE'S A FEW ROUGH EDGES THAT

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:26.121
WE WOULD PROBABLY PREFER TO

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:28.157
WORK OUT BUT I THINK IF IT WERE

01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:29.124
JUST SECTIONS ONE AND TWO.

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:30.960
PROCEEDING AT THIS POINT- MOST

01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:32.461
OF THE OPPOSITION COALITION OF

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:34.029
MY CLIENTS I WOULD REMOVE

01:10:34.096 --> 01:10:35.497
OPPOSITION AND MANY WOULD MOVE

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:38.601
INTO A SUPPORT POSITION- REALLY

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:39.635
QUICKLY THE SYSTEM IS. FORMING

01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:41.503
ACTUALLY QUITE WELL BY WAY OF

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:43.606
REMINDER WE HAVE A NO FAULT

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:48.611
SYSTEM WHICH MEANS IT. DOESN'T

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:49.878
MATTER. WHO IS RESPOND FOR IN

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:51.246
FACT. HAPPENED AT WORK IT NEEDS

01:10:51.313 --> 01:10:52.247
TO BE PICKED UP BY SYSTEM AND

01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:52.881
WHAT WE HAVE IT DOES. TO THAT

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:54.383
AS LIBERAL. CLOSET I HEARD TALK

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:56.218
ABOUT. REFERENCE NOT OUR FAULT

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:57.353
THIS WEEK AND I JUST MEANS.

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:58.454
THAT WHEN A JUDGE THE VALUE THE

01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.722
LAW THEY HAVE TO ERR ON THE

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:00.623
SIDE OF THE INJURED WORKER IN

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:01.790
PROVIDING BENEFITS TO THE

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:03.092
INJURED WORKER. TO THE VAST

01:11:03.158 --> 01:11:04.326
MAJORITY OF THE CLAIMS ARE

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:05.294
BEING ACCEPTED RIGHT NOW

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:06.996
THERE'S TWO MAJOR REASONS THAT

01:11:07.062 --> 01:11:08.430
THEY'RE NOT I WANT TO TOUCH ON

01:11:08.497 --> 01:11:09.431
THOSE BRIEFLY BECAUSE THEY

01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:10.799
SHOULD BE ELIMINATED. ONE

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:12.101
PEOPLE FILE CLAIMS WHEN THEY'RE

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:13.335
NOT SURE THEY'RE ACTUALLY SICK

01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:14.637
THEY KILLED THOUGH THEY HAVE NO

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:15.838
EXPOSURE AND SO THEY NEED TO GO

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.673
AHEAD AND FILE A CLAIM. AS A

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:18.774
PROTECTIVE MEASURE UP

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:21.076
COMPLETELY REASONABLE- WHAT

01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:22.344
HAPPENS A LOT OF THE CASE THAT

01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:23.879
THEY NEVER GET SECOND I NEVER

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:24.780
CAST BECAUSE THE POCKET OF THE

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:26.615
CODE THAT. WE ARE REQUIRED BY

01:11:26.682 --> 01:11:28.250
LAW AT THAT POINT TO ACT ON

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:29.752
THOSE CLAIMS EITHER ACCEPT OR

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:30.886
DENY THEM WITHIN THE STATUTORY

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:32.287
PERIOD. OF THOSE PLANS

01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:34.156
ULTIMATELY DENIED. THE OTHER

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:35.557
MAJOR CATEGORY THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:37.660
SOMEWHERE- YOU KNOW NORTH OF

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:39.528
TEN PERCENT. IS IN THE ACTUAL

01:11:39.595 --> 01:11:41.630
CLAIM FORM. THE INJURED WORKER

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:42.464
TOLD US THAT THEY DIDN'T GET IT

01:11:42.531 --> 01:11:44.033
AT WORK. SO THEY WILL FILE A

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:45.601
CLAIM FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:46.702
ON THE CLAIM FORM THEY'LL SAY I

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:48.570
GOT PREVENT FROM. MY WIFE MY

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:50.406
SPOUSE MY CHILD WHATEVER IT

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:52.174
STATE THEY GIVE US A FACTUAL

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:58.013
BASIS. FOR IT NOT OCCURRING AT

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:58.881
WORK. I ON SECTION TWO. WHICH I

01:11:58.947 --> 01:12:00.382
UNDER. IS THE BILL'S. WITH VERY

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:02.284
QUICKLY THIS CHAIR WE TWO MAJOR

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:04.787
CONCERN. WHY X. BROAD. 60% OF

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:06.955
THE- COLA. THAT THE- CLAIMS

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:09.291
COATED INFECTION ARE. INSIDE OF

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:10.759
THE CATEGORIES OF EMPLOYEES

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:12.461
COVERED BY SECTION TWO OF THE

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:13.629
BILL. SO WE JUST DON'T SEE A

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:16.131
NEED. TO CREATE A COMPLICATED.

01:12:16.198 --> 01:12:17.433
TRIGGER ON TRIGGER OFF

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:19.201
MECHANISM THAT REQUIRES A BUNCH

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:21.737
OF DATA TRACKING- FOR DIRECT OF

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:23.772
THE EMPLOYEES WHERE. THE DATA

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:24.807
WOULD INDICATE THAT THERE IS

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:26.742
NOT A HIGH CONCENTRATION. OF

01:12:26.809 --> 01:12:27.643
INFECTIONS OR A HIGH

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:30.179
CONCENTRATION OF RISK. THERE'S

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:31.246
ONE MAJOR ISSUE THAT I DO WANT

01:12:31.313 --> 01:12:32.915
TO RAISE- ROLLED INTO THIS

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.416
CLUSTER. APPROACH THAT HAD

01:12:34.483 --> 01:12:36.351
MAJOR CONCERNS MY NUMBER IS NOT

01:12:36.418 --> 01:12:38.353
AS- IF WE HAVE TO SIMILARLY

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.588
SITUATED EMPLOYEES SAY THERE'S-

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:42.658
DAY DO THE SAME JOB THEY WORK

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:45.594
IN THE SAME LOCATION. BUT ONE

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:46.161
OF THEM BABY GOT SICK DURING

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:47.830
THE PERIOD. TRANSACTION THE ONE

01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:49.965
DIDN'T MAYBE THE FACT FOR BOTH.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:52.668
ARE NOT CLEAR. AS AN EMPLOYER

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:53.802
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PICK UP

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:55.104
ONE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:55.671
TO PICK UP THE OTHER AND IT

01:12:55.738 --> 01:12:57.072
PUTS US IN A SITUATION OF

01:12:57.139 --> 01:12:58.574
TREATING VERY SIMILAR EMPLOYEES

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.909
VERY DEFINITELY. THAT'S

01:13:00.976 --> 01:13:01.477
EXTRAORDINARILY PROBLEMATIC

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:03.812
FROM THE WORK. PERSPECTIVE SO

01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:05.814
WITH THAT. WE URGE YOU TO VOTE

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:06.381

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:08.951
FACT. I'M OPPOSED TO IT- IT'S A

01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:12.020
STRANGE POSITION AND I

01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:12.588

EXECUTIVE ORDER BECAUSE WE

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:47.589
UNDERSTOOD THAT DURING THE

SHUTDOWN PAGE INTO PANDEMIC

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:50.058

RISK ISN'T TO WORKERS. THAT

01:13:52.928 --> 01:13:53.929
THEY WERE UNDERTAKING JUST BY

AUTHORED TOO SO I GUESS I'M IN

01:18:24.733 --> 01:18:27.135
THE SAME BOAT A MISTER COOLEY

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:36.078
HAS A STATEMENT OR QUESTION.

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:37.279
BECAUSE THIS IS TIED TO CLOVER

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:39.281
THIS IS ACTUALLY A CIRCUMSTANCE

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:41.283
WHICH IS INTENSE NOW. AND IN

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:42.818
GENERAL WE DO THINK A LITTLE

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:45.921
TALE ALL. BY SOME MEANS HERD

01:18:45.987 --> 01:18:48.056
IMMUNITY VACCINE SO IT ACTUALLY

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:49.224
IS DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:50.892

01:19:02.437 --> 01:19:03.205
FIGHTING THE BATTLE I THINK IT

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:05.273
IS APPROPRIATE. BUT  DO THINK

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:07.242
AS POLICY MAKERS IT'S WELL TO

01:19:07.309 --> 01:19:09.511

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:11.613
CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH OVER TIME.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.417
WE DO ANTICIPATE WON'T BE WORSE

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:16.384
AND VERY LIKELY WILL BE

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:18.353
