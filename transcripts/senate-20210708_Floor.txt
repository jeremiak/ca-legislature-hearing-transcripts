THAT DEDICATED FOR COUNTIES TO OPERATE THE RECALL ELECTION BY TWENTY EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION. TO A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE POINT SIX MILLION. THIS IS BASED ON UPDATED ESTIMATES THAT THE COUNTY'S PROVIDED. THE WEAPON THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

PRESIDENT LAID DOWN THE SENATE I AM DISPOSED TO SUPPORTERS MONEY FOR THE WILD LAND PROTECTION BUT I KIND OF OBJECT TO THE AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY THAT WE'RE GIVING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THIS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT THEY'VE ALREADY FAILED US. IN THIS AND I'M JUST DISTRUSTFUL OF WHAT THEY MAY DO WHEN WE PUT FORWARD MONEY TO CLEAN UP THE FOURTH AND WHILE LANCE AND THEN THEY DON'T. ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN. AND THAT THAT THAT SPEECH TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AUTHORITY THAT WE ARE NOT. GIVE THEM. THANK YOU SENATOR MAYOR DALLY. THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND MEMBERS I ALSO WANTED TO DESCRIBE YESTERDAY WE HAD A REALLY VIGOROUS DEBATE ON. THE OTHER HALF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND WHERE THE MONEY ACTUALLY GO SO THERE'S GOING TO BE. A TRAILER BILL THAT WILL BE FOLLOWING I BELIEVE IT'S A RESOURCES TRAINER BILL. DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER BUT- WE ALLOCATED IN SEPT TWO MOST OF THE MONEY TO GO TO CAL FIRE AND CAL FIRE IS BEEN. BUSY AS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW FIGHTING FIRES AND WE NEED TO THE OTHER AGENCIES THAT WE ALLOCATED MONEY TO LIKE THE CONSERVANCY'S THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND THOSE FOLKS. ACTUALLY DISPERSE THEIR MONEY AND THERE'S STILL A NEED FOR MORE MONEY SO. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT ONE WEEK YOU HAVE THE TRAILER BILL THAT WE PUT THAT MONEY INTO DIFFERENT THOSE OTHER PARTS OF THE OF THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY CAN GET THE MONEY ON THE GROUND AND I. JUST TOOK SOME- INFORMATION JUST FROM MY LOCAL OUR CD AND FIRE SAFE COUNCIL OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE PROJECTS THAT ARE. READY TO GO HAVE THE SECRET DONE. AND JUST NEED THE FUNDS SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE AND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OTHER MEMBERS- THAT WE WOULD. IN THE TRAINER BILL MAKE SURE WE TAKE THAT MONEY AND NOT GIVE TO CAL FIRE WHO. CAN'T GET IT OUT. BUT GIVEN TO AGENCIES THAT CAN ACTUALLY DISPERSE THE FUNDS AND GET ON THE GROUND AND ACTUALLY INCREASED AMOUNT OF ACRES THAT WE NEED TO BE TREATING IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MR CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR DELHI SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND- SHE THE WORK DONE HERE I WOULD JUST HAVE.

LOCALISM AS WE PUSH FORWARD I HEARD VERY GOOD SIGNALS FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THAT RESPECT- SO APPRECIATE THE URGENCY OF THIS MATTER AND I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A BIG BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT ON ON SOMETHING ROBUST GOING FORWARD SO. WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ARRIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON. FOLLOW HIM TWENTY TWO EIGHTY ONE SIXTY ONE ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER SKINNER WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH- JUST IN REFERENCE TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS- YES THERE IS A FIRE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM IN OUR EARLY ACTION. THERE WAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION. THAT WAS FOR GRANTS AND THOSE GRANTS WERE FOR SUCH THINGS AS FIRE SAFE COUNCILS RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS LOCAL AGENCIES AND OTHERS. AND THAT EARLY ACTION PLAN. WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE THE ARCHITECTURE. THAT IS THE BASIS FOR OUR DISCUSSION THIS SUMMER ON THE WILDFIRE PACKAGE WHICH WE WILL TAKE ACTION ON. IN- PROBABLY WHEN WE RETURNED FROM BREAK- AND IN THAT WILDFIRE PACKAGE.

ASSEMBLY BILL ONE THIRTY BY THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AN ACT RELATING TO EDUCATION FINANCE AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGET. YES. DON'T GO. YEAH. IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE. SEVENTY SEARS CANADA YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS AT ONE THIRTY IT IS OUR TRAILER BILL ON A K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION. ENDED CONTAIN STATUTORY CHANGES TO EMPLOYMENT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. AND THE STATUTORY CHANGES INCLUDE IT ENABLES US TO PROCEED WITH THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM BEGINNING IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE SCHOOL YEAR ENDED TV'S UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. NOW I WILL NOTE THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CHILDCARE. PACIFIC'S WE DID HOWEVER ACT IN OUR BUDGET BILL WE ACTED TO FIND CHILDCARE. BUT SINCE CHILDCARE WAS REMOVED FROM THE PROP NINETY EIGHT FINDING WE ARE NOT DOING IT IN THIS BILL AND WE WILL DO IT SUBSEQUENTLY. BUT TOGETHER. THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM THE CHILDCARE ACTIONS THAT WE WILL WE HAVE TAKEN AND WE WILL TAKE AS WELL AS THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM IN THIS BILL. THAT WILL PROVIDE TICKET STUDENTS T. K. THROUGH GRADE SIX WITHACCESS TO AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND PROGRAMS DURING BREAKS SUCH AS SUMMER RECESS. SO THAT WE CAN REALLY ACHIEVE GOOD CARE AND EDUCATION FOR OUR CHILDREN FOR A FULL DAY TWENTY FIVE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THE ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL AMENDS THE INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES HAVE AN OPTION TO CONTINUE DISTANCE LEARNING. IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR IT INCREASES THE VALUE OF THE CONCENTRATION GRANT OUT ON ADJUSTMENT AS PART OF OUR LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA CALCULATION SO IT IT JUST SAID FROM 50% 265% ON THE BASE GRANT. AND SPECIFIES THAT THIS INCREASED FUNDING BE USED TO INCREASE SCHOOL SITE STAFFING INCLUDING CUSTODIAL STAFF. IT INCREASES ONGOING PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM. BY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ON GOING. REQUIRES LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES IN THIS ONE I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE PARTICULARLY PROUD OF BECAUSE IT MAKES US THE FIRST STATE TO DO SO IT ENSURES THAT OUR K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS IF THEY WANT TO HAVE A MEAL AT SCHOOL THEY'RE ENTITLED TO TWO MEALS. IN THE SCHOOL DAY WITHOUT BURDENSOME PAPERWORK AND WITHOUT OTHER GROUPS THAT THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW IN HIS WE KNOW A HUNGRY CHILD DOES NOT LEARN WELL THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF REASONS A CHILD MAKES SHOW UP AT SCHOOL HUNGRY THIS WILL ALLEVIATE THAT AND IT IS A GREAT ACTION. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL HAS SOME VERY RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING AS OUR SUB ONE CHAIR SENATOR FROM SANTA CRUZ POINTED OUT IN OUR HEARING YESTERDAY IT FULLY PAYS OFF. THE DEFERRALS FOR IN OUR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OUR PROPERTY NINETY EIGHT PAYMENT DEFERRALS AND ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO OUR PROP NINETY EIGHT RAINY DAY FUND AND I BELIEVE FOR THE FIRST TIME- AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER'S SENATOR NIELSEN. AND I HAVE AN AMENDMENT AT THE DESK THANK YOU CENTER NELSON HAS MEMBERS AT THE DESK SECRETARY PLEASE READ AMENDMENTS BY SENATOR NIELSEN SET ONE. SENATOR NELSON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE THIS AMENDMENT WOULD. REMOVE UNITIVE. AT A CHARTER MORATORIUM. YOU KNOW CHANGE IT. THE ATTACK BY SOME ENTITIES THE PROCESS ON CHARTER SCHOOLS WILL NEVER NEVER END. THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE A MAGNIFICENT OPPORTUNITY AN OPTION FOR OUR PARENTS ON THE GROWTH OF CHARTER SCHOOLS. HAS BEEN MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT FROM THE ETHNIC COMMUNITIES. HELLO THING THAT THEIR CHILDREN HAD BEEN HARMED. BUT PUBLIC EDUCATION. AND WHO ARE SEEKING THE OPPORTUNITY OF CHARTER SCHOOLS FOR THEIR STUDENTS. HI THIS IS A NEW OBJECT AND THAT'S WHAT THESE AMENDMENTS ARE GOING TO DO IN THE BUDGET TO TAKE THESE- THESE PUNITIVE MEASURES AND THE MORATORIUM. ON THE CHARTER SCHOOLS AFTER.

EIGHTY ONE THIRTY CENTER LABOR YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT AND SAY THAT THIS IS REALLY A NEW AND EXCITING TIME FOR EDUCATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY ARE WE FULLY FUNDING A THROUGH G. SO ALL OF OUR STUDENTS IN THE STATE WILL HAVE ACCESS THROUGH EIGHT TWO EIGHT THREE G. COURSES ME THEY WILL THEN BE ABLE TO GO TO A UNIVERSITY OR A C. ISSUE IF THEY SO CHOOSE. WE'RE ALSO DOUBLING THE AMOUNT OF C. T. E. MONEY THAT WE ARE GOING WE ARE GOING TO THERE IS IN THIS BUDGET AND I'VE SAID FOR YEARS THAT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE BOTH FOR OUR STUDENTS WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE OPTIONS IN C. T. E. BUT ALSO THE OPTION TO GO TO COLLEGE SO I THINK IN THIS BUDGET WE HAVE FINALLY GOTTEN THERE AND IT'S VERY EXCITING. WE'RE ALSO RAISING THE PER PUPIL SPENDING FROM THAT OUR ELEAZAR OUR SCHOOLS OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL USE THIS MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL AT EVERY SCHOOL OR TWO DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF YOUR SCHOOL OR THREE. THAT THERE'S A SCHOOL NURSE AT EVERY SCHOOL THAT EVERY STUDENT HAS WHAT THEY NEED TO SUCCEED BEING IT IN TEXTBOOKS. AND IN. PHONE TABLETS SO I DOES RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT AND FEEL THIS IS REALLY AN EXCITING DAY FOR EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SENATOR LABOR SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE I ALSO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB ONE THIRTY- AS A CURRENT TEACHER ON LEAVE AND FORMER SEVENTEEN YEAR TEACHER I ALSO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR CHILDREN WELL FIRST OF ALL I AM SO PLEASED TO SEE THAT OUR STUDENTS WILL BE FAD IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT OUR STUDENTS COME PREPARED. AND IT'S NOT ONLY FOR THEIR LEARNING BUT ALSO FOR THEIR NUTRITION AND I MANY TIMES HAD FOOD IN MY CLASSROOM JUST BECAUSE OUR KIDS CAME INTO THE CLASSROOM SO HUNGRY AND I KNEW THAT I HAD TO FEED THEM AND SO I'M SO PROUD THAT THIS LEGISLATURE THAT WE'VE INCLUDED THAT IN THE BUDGET. AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW I SEE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THE STUDENTS I'VE SEEN SO MANY KIDS COME AND- YOU KNOW I'M NOT BEING ABLE TO HOLD A PENCIL. WHILE THEIR COUNTERPARTS ALREADY READING TWO THREE READING LEVELS ABOVE THEM AND SO THIS WILL HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND I THINK. THIS CREEK IMPORTANT ALSO FOR TEACHERS- DURING THE PANDEMIC I HAD SO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES CALLING INTO SHARING HOW EXHAUSTED THEY WERE. HOW TIRED THEY WORK EVEN THOUGH THEY ALWAYS DID IT WITH A SMILE AND ALWAYS WERE PREPARED THEY REALLY WERE PLEADING FOR SUPPORT IN THIS. AREA AND SOME REALLY ALSO VERY PROUD THEY WERE ABLE TO. TO INVEST IN EARLY CHILD. EDUCATION BECAUSE IT PREPARES OUR STUDENTS BETTER. AND THAT ALSO HELPS OUR TEACHERS NOT TO STAR STUDENTS AND- I'M WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THIS LEGISLATURE TO. THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO EVERYONE THAT WORKED ON THIS AND TO ALL THE TEACHERS OUT THERE. WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THAT WE HEAR YOU WE UNDERSTAND YOU AND TO ALL THE PARENTS OUT THERE THEY COULDN'T. GET THEIR KIDS TO. AT T. K. NOW YOU CAN AND SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO SENATOR BECKER. THANK YOU BUT YOU'RE SO SEE MY COMMENTS WITH THE CENTER FROM CHINO. IS IT THIS IS IN STARK BILL. AS IS MY TIME TO CHARGE YOUR PARTITIONS COUNCIL HAVE BEEN A STRONG ADVOCATE OF EARLY LEARNING. AND WE KNOW THAT INVESTMENTS IN EARLY LEARNING PAY STRONG DIVIDENDS. DOWN THE ROAD AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT BEGINS THE INVESTMENT IN EARLY LEARNING. REALLY HISTORIC INTESTINE ACROSS THE BOARD LOOK FORWARD TO ADDING A GREAT REFORM. A TO THOSE EFFORTS BUT THIS BILL WITH EARLY LEARNING WITH THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PARTNERSHIPS HAS SO MANY. HISTORIC IMPORTANT ELEMENTS AND I STRONGLY- RISE AND- REQUESTING A VOTE. THE SAME BECKER CENTER LAYERED. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I THINK I WANTED TO. SORT OF ENCAPSULATED TORT TALLADEGA WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE ON K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION AND FIRST LET ME REALLY THANK THE SENATORS FROM YUCAIPA AND IRVINE WHO ROUNDED OUT BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ONE WHEN WE APPROVED THE BUDGET BUT TOGETHER WITH THE ASSEMBLY WE PROVED ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL MOTIONS IT WAS THE RESULT OF THIRTEEN HEARING SERVICE A RESULT OF HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TESTIFYING. AND PART OF THE BUDGET IS NOT IN THE TRAILER BILL TODAY THE GLOBAL PART AND IT IS REALLY WORTH CALLING OUT BECAUSE IT'S THE BACKDROP FOR WHAT WE'RE APPROVING TODAY WE HAVE AN PROP NINETY EIGHT A RESTORATION TO WHERE IT WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND A FIVE POINT 007% COST OF LIVING INCREASE. WHICH PUTS OUR SPENDING ON K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION AT A RECORD LEVEL WE ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME HAVE A RAINY DAY FUND AS SPECIFIED BY THE PROPOSITION THE VOTERS ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN A RAINY DAY FUND JUST FOR EDUCATION SO WE HAVE ROUGHLY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WHEN WE ADOPT THIS BUDGET. THAT WILL BE A RAINY DAY FUND OF FOUR WHEN EVER WE HIT THE NEXT RECESSION ADDITIONALLY THERE IS STILL IN THE BUDGET A BUY DOWN AN ASSIST OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR PURSE AND STIRRERS THAT WILL BE A BIG HELP AND WITH ALL THAT A A BACKDROP. WELL THE THINGS THAT THE SENATOR FROM CHINO AND THE SENATOR FROM SAN MATTEO COUNTY AND OTHERS THAT HAVE SPOKEN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE THE ONE OF THE KEY ONES IS THAT THE BUDGET AS PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISE DID NOT PAY OFF THE SCHOOL DEFERRALS FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE THIS BUDGET DOGS SO THAT ANY SCHOOL DISTRICT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT WENT INTO DEBT. IN FEAR OF PANDEMIC CUTS WE'LL HAVE THAT. FOR A REAL A DISH. AS WAS SAID BY THE BUDGET CHAIR. BY THIS SETS FORWARD- THE INDEPENDENT STUDIES AND WE RUN THE RISK OF FUNDING DECLINING ENROLLMENT BECAUSE OF KIDS THAT DON'T COME BACK WHEN SCHOOLS FULLY RE OPEN WHICH WE WERE ALL LOOKING FORWARD TO IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER. BUT IF THERE IS A PARENT OR GUARDIAN THAT IS WORRIED ABOUT A HEALTH CHALLENGE. VAN THIS GIVES AN ALTERNATIVE AND WE WILL IN TURN NOT BE FUNDING DECLINING ENROLLMENT A NEXT YEAR. THERE'S MONEY HERE FOR SPECIAL ED. BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE HEARD SO THERE IS A ONE TIME MAJOR SPENDING TOWARD SPECIAL EDUCATION SIMILARLY CAREER TECH. SO THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST BUDGET IN MODERN TIMES FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION. THIS TRAILER BILL IMPLEMENTED ALL THOSE CHANGES SO I WILL BE PROUD TO SUPPORT IT AND ASK MY COLLEAGUES FOR AN IPHONE. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED SENATOR GLAZER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I CERTAINLY JOIN WITH MIKE- MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN EXPRESSING APPRECIATION TO THE BUDGET CHAIR AND DO OUR BUDGETS- ONE CHAIR- THIS BILL AT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE BUDGET PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT BUDGET ISSUE THAT IS COMING BEFORE THIS FLORIDA HAS SO MANY THINGS IN THERE THAT ARE IMPORTANT AS MANY OF MY. COMMENT IN A BILL THAT HAS SO MUCH AND IT'S THAT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING AT LEAST THAT IT MAY BE ONE DOESN'T LIKE I WANT TO JUST NOTE THE RARE EXCEPTION FOR ME. AND THAT'S THE MORATORIUM ON NINE NINE CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS. THAT DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THOSE THOSE PROGRAMS IN PARTICULAR. WERE LIFESAVERS FOR SO MANY FAMILIES AND THEIR KIDS. BECAUSE OF THE EXPERTISE. BUT THOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS HAD DEVELOPED. IN THOSE TYPES OF REMOTE. LEARNING PROGRAMS NOW. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME RARE PROBLEMS IN THIS SPACE. WE HAD A BILL THAT PASSED FOR A MONTH OR SO AGO THAT ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM. UNFORTUNATELY THAT THE BILL HAS BEEN DENIED A HEARING- IN THE ASSEMBLY THE FIX THAT. UNIQUE PROBLEMS AND A NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOL THE MORATORIUM I THINK GOES TOO FAR TO TIME WHEN WE SHOULD BE DOING THE OPPOSITE BUT OTHER THAN THAT THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL WITH MANY GREAT THINGS IN IT AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. THANK YOU SARAH GLAZER ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING NINE CENTER SCANNER YOU MAY CLOSE.

YESTERDAY THE GOVERNOR WAS ASKED ABOUT RE IMPLEMENTING KEVIN NINETEEN RESTRICTIONS AND HE SAID IF WE CONTINUE TO GET PEOPLE VACCINATED THEN THAT WOULD BE UNNECESSARY. SO AGAIN I WOULD POINT OUT THAT EVERYONE WHO WANTS A VACCINE CAN GET ONE IN MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE DONE SO FAR SO IF YOU FOLLOW THE SCIENCE. THEN YOU KNOW THE VACCINE IS NINETY THREE PERCENT- EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING HOSPITALIZATION WHICH WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE SHUT DOWN SO THEIR HOSPITALS DIDN'T GET OVERWHELMED.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO- GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENTS. ITEMS TWENTY SIX THROUGH THIRTY SENATOR LAYERED WILL BE PRESENTING. ON ITEM TWENTY SIX FIRST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT FILE ITEM TWENTY SIX IS THE CONFIRMATION OF LIANE RANDOLPH AS CHAIR OF THE ERROR RESOURCE RORY READ SOURCES PORT. PRIOR TO THIS APPOINTMENT MISS RANDOLPH SERVED AS A COMMISSIONER OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION SHE WAS DEPUTY SECRETARY AND GENERAL COUNSEL AT THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND SHE ALSO PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS CHAIR OF THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION. FOR APPOINTMENT WAS APPROVED BY THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE ON MAY TWENTY SIXTH ON A FIVE OH VOTE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE. THANK YOU SHARE LEARN DISCUSSION AND DEBATE CENTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF MIS. READ OFF TO THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD BUT I DO SHOW. AND RAISING SOME GREAT CONCERNS AS TO. THE OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT OF SUCH AGENCY. AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT HER SKILLS THAT SHE BRINGS I'VE HAD OPPORTUNITY WORK WEATHER OVER THE YEARS WITH PC COMMISSION. SO I KNOW SHE'S A SKILLED AND DEDICATED. ADMINISTRATOR BUT I'M ALSO TROUBLED BY THE AUDIT THAT WAS REQUESTED THAT I REQUESTED LAST YEAR HE CAME BACK EARLY THIS YEAR. AND IT WAS SKATING AT BEST. AS TO. THE BLATANT DISREGARD. FOR DIVERSITY NOT ONLY IN THE WORKPLACE BUT IN OPINION SO I'M EXCITED TO SEE ME THROUGH IT OFF AS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN. TO OVERSEE THIS POOR BUT I HOPE IT'S NOT A TOKEN APPOINTMENT I HOPE SHE'S ALLOWED TO DO THE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED IN SUCH AGENCY AS STATED IN THE AUDIT EARLIER THIS YEAR. AUDIT THAT CLEARLY STATED IT DISREGARDED PEOPLE OF COLOR OPINION BUT IT'S A AGENCY THAT CONTINUES TO PICK UP BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES IN POOR COMMUNITIES FOR MOST OF THE FUNDS THAT THEY GET EVERY YEAR AND VERY RARELY DOES ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS IN DOLLARS EVER REACH THIS COMMUNITY. SO I HOPE WE STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HER OF CHANGING THE CULTURE. AT CAR. AGENCY THAT IS IN DIRE NEED OF REAL IMPLEMENTATION A- AGENCY THAT TOLD ME LAST YEAR THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. FOR POOR PEOPLE WAS A ZERO EMISSION CAR. LAUGHABLE AT BEST NOT UNTIL ELECTRIC CARS BECOME THE TOOLS OF TE WORKING PEOPLE SO THE TOYS OF THE RICH WE EVER HAVE FULL ADOPTION SO I HOPE AGAIN WITH THE APPOINTMENT OF MR RUDOLPH WE WILL SEE. GREATER DIVERSITY NOT ONLY IN THE WORKPLACE IN THE WORK FORCE BUT IN OPINION AND THOUGHT AS WELL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SIR BRADFORD CENTER WAY SO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SENATORS SIGH I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS APPOINTMENT IT'S WONDERFUL. TO PUT A PERSON OF COLOR IN A POSITION SO IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OFTEN TIMES THE ONES THAT. ARE THE- OF THE VICTIMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE- COMMUNITIES THAT TEND TO LIVE IN SOME OF THE MOST CONTAMINATED- PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN SOME OF THE MOST CONTAMINATED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND I HAVE WORKED WITH- MISS RANDOLPH THREW IN HER ROLE OF PC AND I CAN I CAN TELL YOU YOU. THIS IS THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE JOB. SHE'S AN INTELLIGENT HARDWORKING INDIVIDUAL THAT- HAS- CALIFORNIA FIRST AND FOREMOST IN HER MIND IN HER DUTIES. SHE'S GONNA FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES FOR THIS IMPORTANT APPOINTMENT THAT'S GOING TO DO SO MUCH IN IMPROVING CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU SIR MR CENTER MY CASKEY. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I HAD A RECENT OPPORTUNITY WERE A COUPLE OTHER MEMBERS TO TALK TO MISS. RANDOLPH ABOUT THE APPOINTMENT AND I SHARED WITH HER SOME OF MY CONCERNS ON THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM HAS BEEN RUNNING I KNOW THE- ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE. PARTICIPATED AS WE DID IN THE- TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLANNING AND THEY SENT A LETTER. OBJECTING TO THE FACT THAT NONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE INCORPORATED THE SCOPING PLAN. AND WE HAD A- VERY POSITIVE DISCUSSION BECAUSE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A NEW CHAIR TO COME IN AND NOT NECESSARILY PIPIT BUT MAKE SOME. CHANGES IN THE OPERATION I RECEIVED FROM- SECTOR BLUMENFELD. THIRTEEN MONTHS AGO A LETTER- PROFESSING HER INDICATING THAT HE WOULD WORK WITH CARP LEADERSHIP IN ORDER TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE THAT CHANGED THE STATE'S CLIMATE STRATEGY. THAT WE DON'T RELY SO MUCH ON CAP AND TRADE WHAT WE ACTUALLY CHANGE CAP AND TRADE SO THAT THE FLOOR PRICE IS NOT EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AND SOME CHANGE. BUT CLOSE TO THE FORTY ONE DOLLARS WHICH IS WHICH IS WHAT THE- COST THE POLLUTION IS YOU KNOW WE MAY NOT WANT WANT TO PAY MORE MONEY BUT BUT THE PROGRAM RUNS. AS THE AS THE PRO IN ORDER TO FORCE BEHAVIOR TO CHANGE AND ALSO TO ALL THE BENEFITS IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES WERE THE- CALL THESE GOING TO GOING TO IMPROVE. I WAS DELIGHTED TO HAVE HER RESPOND THAT SHE SHARES MY ENTHUSIASM THAT CALIFORNIA MUST. PUT SOME MONEY OR SOME. OFF INTO THE CLIMATE AMBITIONS THAT WE SO WE STAYED YOU KNOW I'M I VOTED FOR EVERY BILL THAT HAS COME UP HERE THAT SAYS WE WANT TO DO THIS IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE WANT TO DO THIS IN TWENTY THIRTY. BUT SHE SAID NOT SYMBOLS TYPE OF PERSON AND I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT SHE'S GOING TO LISTEN TO THE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE SENATE HAS FOR YEARS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY HAS. FOR YEARS AND MAKE THESE PROGRAMS PERFORM THE WAY THAT THEY ARE IN WE TALKED AT LENGTH ABOUT THE STATE OF WASHINGTON WHICH HAS THEIR OWN CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND THEY CRITICIZE. CALIFORNIA AND WE KNOW ON TYRAEL LEFT OUR OUR MARKET BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T SATISFIED THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL- MISTER I GUESS IT WOULD BE RAISED SOME POINTS O.

WITHOUT INSURANCE FARMERS CANNOT ACCESS LOANS TO UPDATE EQUIPMENT- PLANT THEIR CROPS ARE PAID WORKERS ESPECIALLY IN A TIME WHEN THEY NEED IT THE MOST. S. B. ELEVEN IS A GOOD STEP TOWARDS HELPING A CRITICAL PART OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMY AND HELP IN AN INDUSTRY THAT IS TRYING TO OVERCOME. ESCALATING RISKS DUE TO WILDFIRES. IT WILL HELP CLOSE THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COVERAGE GAPS THAT ARE LEAVING. OUR FARMERS EXPOSED TO MAJOR LOSSES. THIS BILL. WILL ALLOW FARMERS FARMERS RANCHERS AND GROWERS TO PURCHASE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE FROM THE FAIR PLAN JUST LIKE ANY OTHER BUSINESS IN THE STATE. IN ADDITION THIS WILL REQUIRE. THE FAIR PLAN TO FILE A RATE APPLICATION INCLUDING THIS COVERAGE WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE.

I BELIEVE SIR CALERO IS PRESENTING THAT AND SECRETARY PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL NINE SEVENTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK SILVA AN ACT RELATING TO MOBILE HOMES. THEIR CAREER THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE TO PRESENT AB EIGHT NINE SEVENTY EIGHT ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYWOMAN QUIRK SILVA MEMBERS THIS IS A DISTRICT BUILT FOR IT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS BILL BUILDS UPON THE IMPORTANT POLITY POLICY DISCUSSIONS THAT TOOK PLACE IN TWENTY NINETEEN RELATED TO RENT STABILIZATION AND EXTENDS THOSE PROTECTIONS TO CERTAIN MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS MOBILE HOME OWNERS JUST LIKE TRADITIONAL HOMEOWNERS PAY MORTGAGE ON THE HOME. MUST PAY FOR REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE AS WELL AS HOME TAXES BUT UNLIKE THE TRADITIONAL HOMEOWNERS FAMOUS ALSO BUDGET FOR RENT EXPENSES FOR THEIR PERSONAL WITHIN THE MOBILE HOME PARK JUST AS RENTS HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED STATEWIDE MOBILE WHOLE HOME RESIDENTS ARE ALSO FACING DRASTIC RENT RENT INCREASES FROM PARK OWNERS HOWEVER SOME MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS EXPERIENCE EAD RENT INCOME INCREASES FIND THEMSELVES IN A UNIQUE SITUATION IN ONE PARTICULAR CASE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS IN THE MOBILE HOME PARK THAT IS IT IS SPLIT BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT CITIES THAT EXPERIENCED BACK TO BACK. DOUBLE DIGIT RENT INCREASES THIS BILL SIMPLY ROUTE LIMITS RENT INCREASES ONLY FOR THOSE RARE SITUATIONS IN WHICH A MOBILE HOME PARK IS LOCATED IN AND GOVERNED BY MORE THAN ONE INCORPORATED CITY TO NO MORE THAN 3% ANNUALLY PLUS THE CPI TO A MAXIMUM OF 5% EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY EIGHT PROVIDES RELIEF TO THOSE VULNERABLE RESIDENTS WHO FIND THEMSELVES. IN THE SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY PAY THE RENT OR PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SIR OF MEMBERS ON FILE AND I'M SEVENTY FIVE EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY EIGHT ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR NEWMAN. OUR TEAM IS PRESENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT THIS MEASURE WHICH HAS BEEN BROUGHT BY MY COLLEAGUE CHECK WORKS OVER. AND THE- EXAMPLE THAT MY COLLEAGUE SHARED ABOUT THE MOBILE HOME PARK IN WHICH IN MY DISTRICT. IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE CHALLENGES IT FACES INDUSTRY WHERE I QUITE OFTEN THE- PERSON OWNS THEIR HOME BUT NOT THE NOT THE PROPERTY UNDERNEATH IT- THESE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE WHO ARE OFTEN SUBJECT. TO ALL THE USUAL PRESSURES BUT BUT POWERLESS IN THE FACE OF MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS. WHO OFTEN EXPLOIT THEIR NEED. AND THE FACT THEY HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE COMMEND THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU SIR NEWMAN CENTER MEANT. FIVE A QUESTION FOR- THE AUTHOR THE PRESENTER I DON'T KNOW YOUR MEN WERE IN I THINK I'VE I'VE I RISE TO ASK A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR THE PRESENTER- ANY ANALYSIS AT CENTER COPYRIGHT WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION. THANK YOU SO YOU CAN TRACK IT IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS IT SAYS THAT- ON PAGE FIVE TO SIX THAT DOES FIT THE BILL WHILE IT SEEMS CLEAR THIS INTENDED ONLY TO APPLY A LAW APPLIES THE RANGE OF APPLAUSE MOBILE HOME PARK. FIVE OUR ANALYSIS- DOES NOTE THAT THIS LIFE WE COULD APPLY TO OTHER MOBILE HOME PARKS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ALSO. THAT THEY COULD IN THEORY APPLY TO OTHER MOBILE HOME PARKS IN THE FUTURE THAT MIGHT BE DEVELOPED- AND THAT IT MIGHT ALSO RUN AFOUL WITHOUT AMENDMENTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS ON SOCIAL LEGISLATION I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH THE AUTHOR OR NOT HI SHE TELLS ME SHE'S TAKEN AMENDMENTS I JUST I DON'T KNOW THE STATUS OF THIS AND THIS THIS KIND OF CONCERNING. THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE INTENT WAS JUST TO MONITOR THIS ONE PART OF THE INDUSTRY BUILT YES SENECA YES TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THIS DOES RIGHT NOW- PLAYED ONLY ONE PARK IS AS FAR AS WE KNOW- IT'S A VERY UNUSUAL SITUATION WHERE A PARK IS SITUATED IN THE JURISDICTION OF TWO CITIES WHAT WE DO IS WE LEAVE IT UP TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DECIDE WITH THE RULES AND- ARE IN REGARDS TO RENT INCREASES. AND WHEN IT WHEN THERE ARE TWO CITIES YOU CAN HAVE IN- YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOU CAN HAVE ONE CITY AGREE IN ONE CITY NOT AGREE AND THAT BASICALLY LEAVES THE PARK RESIDENCE- WITHOUT ANY PROTECTION ANY RENT STABILIZATION PROTECTIONS SO. IF THERE IS ANOTHER INSTANCE WHERE A PARK IS IN TWO DIFFERENT CITIES THEN IT OBVIOUSLY WOULD APPLY- BUT NONE HAVE. BEEN FOUND UP TO THIS POINT AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY HIGHLY UNLIKELY BUT IN THE EVENT THAT A PARK ENDS UP IN TWO CITIES THE CITIES THOSE TWO SEPARATE CITIES CAN AGREE THAT ONE CITY WILL COME. UP WITH A SOLUTION AND IN AND IMPOSE IT ON THE END PARK THAT'S- THE BILL DOESN'T THE BILL. OF LAW GOVERNMENT TO MAKE DECISIONS- IT JUST IT IT IT IT- PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE THAT PROTECTS THE PARK RESIDENTS WHEN NEITHER CITY IS ACTING TO DO TO DO THAT. THANK YOU.

HIGHS TWENTY SEVEN KNOWS- SIX AMENDMENT- THE- MAJOR PASSES. MEMBERS WERE MOVING ON TO FIGHT HIM ONE OH TWO WHICH IS A B. FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WE HAVE SENATOR COM LOGGER FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW. SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW AN ACT RELATING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT CENTER COME UNDER. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND SENATORS AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WOULD PROHIBIT POLICE DEPARTMENTS FROM POSTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA THE MUG SHOTS OF PEOPLE ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF COMMITTING A NON VIOLENT CRIME. IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SUSPECTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PRESUMED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. BUT IF ANY OF YOU EVER HEARD HE TESTIFY ON ANY OF MY BILLS YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T THE CASE. WHEN A DEPARTMENT PUBLISHES A PERSON'S MUGSHOT ON FACEBOOK FOR EXAMPLE WITHOUT WAITING FOR A CONVICTION OR EVEN FOR CHARGES. TO BE FORMALLY FILED THE PUBLIC DOES RUSH TO JUDGMENT THIS CAN CARRY GREAT EVEN LIFELONG CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ACCUSED THESE POSTS ARE SHARED WITH FAMILY FRIENDS EMPLOYERS CAUSING GREAT EMOTIONAL AND FINANCIAL HARM. WITH A GOOGLE SEARCH A MUGSHOT ON FACEBOOK COULD ALLOW COULD FOLLOW A PERSON FOR LIFE EVEN IF THAT PERSON WAS ULTIMATELY NOT FOUND GUILTY. FURTHERMORE THESE POSTER LITTLE TO WARN THE COMMUNITY OF AN ONGOING PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT. AS A SUSPECT IS ALREADY IN CUSTODY AT THE TIME OF POSTING. AND POSTING MUGSHOTS PERPETUATES HARMFUL STEREOTYPES AND FOSTERS BIAS WHICH IS WHY THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT THIS SUMMER DECIDED TO END THE PRACTICE OF RELEASING SUSPECTS MUGSHOTS UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS NOT A RADICAL STEP THE STATE OF UTAH RECENTLY VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO END THE RELEASE OF MUG SHOTS BEFORE A PERSON IS CONVICTED AND THE STATE OF ILLINOIS RECENTLY PASSED A NEARLY IDENTICAL LAW TO THIS. I WANT TO REITERATE THAT THIS BILL APPLIES ONLY TO NON VIOLENT CRIMES AND SIMPLY REAFFIRMS THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE ACCUSED ARE CONSIDERED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SIR COME LONGER CENTER BOARD JUST. THE PRESIDENT. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS ITEM I THINK IT GOES TO THE HEART OF OUR- CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT INDIVIDUAL TRULY IS CONSIDERED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY- IN A PERFECT WORLD THIS WOULD BE EXPANDED- NOT JUST ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA FRONT BUT ALSO- THROUGH PRESS ANNOUNCEMENTS AND OTHER STATEMENTS. WITH EXCEPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE OF THOSE THAT MAYBE HAVE SKIPPED BAIL FOR I HAVE KICKED OVR ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED TO HAVE. DANGEROUS ACTS AND- PUBLIC IS BEING ASKED FOR INFORMATION TO DEFINE THESE INDIVIDUALS BUT THE BILL AS IT STANDS I THINK IS A STRONG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF ANYONE WHO HAS EVER ASSOCIATED OR BEFRIENDED FOLKS- HO'VE BEEN IN THIS SITUATION IT IMPACTS THEM THEIR FAMILIES THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WHEN THEY'RE FOUND INNOCENT AFTER A PROPER PROCESS THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE SO WITH THAT- I ENCOURAGE ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO. SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SIR FOR JUST ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER COM LONGER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AT THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO FOR HIS COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'LL VOTE THANK YOU SIR COME LONGER CENTERS THIS IS FILE I DON'T WANT.
