SO THAT BILL IS SIX ZERO FOR THE ON CALL FOR MISTER JONES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS MS GALGIANI YOU HAVE A SUSPENSE CANDIDATE WHAT YOU WANTED TO PRESENT- UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS GOING TO. GO TO SUSPENSE SO PLEASE COME UP AND TELL US. ABOUT SB THREE EIGHT EIGHT. GOOD MORNING I THE U. S. B. THREE EIGHT EIGHT ASSEMBLY CLARIFYING AND TECHNICAL IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIA ADOPTED TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION ONE WAS BY SENATOR RAINY AND ANOTHER WAS BY SENATOR SPEAR. AND IT WAS INTENDED TO COLLABORATE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ENSURE THAT WE ADDRESS MISSING PERSON CASES IN A CERTAIN WAY AND AT THAT TIME- DUE TO CONCERN THAT WAS A NEW PROGRAM AND AGAIN THIS WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO. THERE WAS A CLAUSE IN THE LAW THAT ALLOWED COUNTIES TO VOTE TO OPT OUT OF FOLLOWING THE STATE REQUIREMENTS. THE SENATOR JACQUI SPEARS BILL REQUIRE THAT A DATABASE BE SET UP FOR THAT MISSING PERSONS COULD HAVE THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. COME FORWARD AND PROVIDE DNA IN THE EVENT THAT THE MISSING PERSON WOULD LATER BE FOUND AND THEN SENATOR RAINEY'S BILL ADDRESSED HELL AND IDENTIFIED. REMAINS OF. OF LOVED ONES WOULD BE HANDLED. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE COUNTIES COMPLY THERE ARE ONLY A FEW COUNTIES THAT AREN'T COMPLYING ALL OF THE TIME THERE ARE SOME COUNTIES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE THEIR MISSING PERSONS LISTED ON FACEBOOK. BUT IF THEY'RE LISTED ON FACEBOOK AND THE INDIVIDUALS REMAINS ARE FOUND SOMEWHERE ELSE THEY WILL THEY WILL NEVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE IDENTIFIED OF DNA IS NOT TAKEN. THIS THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CAME TO LIGHT TO MY COMMUNITY IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE WHEN THERE WERE TWO SERIAL KILLERS WHO WERE ACTIVE BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. AND NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT SOME OF YOUR MEMBER THEY- SUPPOSEDLY KILLED SEVENTY TWO INDIVIDUALS THERE WERE FIVE MISSING PERSONS WHO WERE RECOVERED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TWO WERE FROM CALAVERAS COUNTY. CHEVY WHEELER WHO WENT MISSING IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE CINDY VANDER HIDING WHO WENT MISSING IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND THEN THREE WOMEN FROM A WELL FORTY FIVE FEET DEEP- JOANNE HOBSON WHO HAD BEEN MISSING SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE KEEP BILLY BILLY FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. AND ONE ONE AND WHO TO THIS DAY REMAINS UNIDENTIFIED AND SHE'S ON IDENTIFIED BECAUSE EITHER LAW ENFORCEMENT DIDN'T TAKE DNA FROM THE FAMILY OR THE FAMILY DIDN'T COME FOR HER SHE DIDN'T HAVE FAMILY BUT NONE THE LESS SHE TO THIS DAY REMAINS. UNIDENTIFIED DNA WAS TAKEN FROM HER REMAINS BUT WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT SHE WAS CREMATED AS AN ANTIGEN SO WHILE THIS BILL IS PAID IS HAVING COST. A PERHAPS A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS I DON'T EVEN BELIEVE IT'S THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE SO FEW COUNTIES THAT AREN'T ACTUALLY DOING THIS ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S TWENTY YEARS THAT HAVE PASSED SINCE THE TIME. I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL IS FOUND AND BY DEBT A NON HIS THAT. A STATE AND THE DOG. THAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING STRUGGLE THE FINANCIAL. COST TO COUNTY TO BURY THAT ENDED AS IN A GEN THE HIGH TAKING. KING DEAN A. DOES NOT TAKE THEM. EIGHT CAUGHT BOB I THE IN THE MAIL AND IT'S A MATTER OF. THE REPORT. MY OFFICE HEALTH AND REALLY WE'VE HAD SEVERAL IN THE- ATTY TO THE TO GENERAL STATED. HAS FAMILIES CAME FOR. DURING THAT TIME WHO HAD LEFT INTO A COME AND SO I'M SURE WITH YOU THAT I. GONE WORKED WITH MY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE AG'S OFFICE TO ENSURE THAT FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE THEIR LOVED ONES ADDED TO THE STATE'S DATABASE IT WAS ALWAYS THE INTENTION. THAT WOULD WORK THAT WAY AND AGAIN IT'S BEEN AND STATUTES CENTS. FOR TWENTY YEARS IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S A FEW COUNTIES WHO. CAN OPT NOT TO PARTICIPATE SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS CLARIFYING IN TECHNICAL AND I WOULD HOPE THAT IT WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE SUSPENSE FILE. THANK YOU. ME WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NO NOT AT THIS POINT XIN SIR FILE NEW FILE NO FILE SO THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING OBVIOUS IT IS A SUSPENSE CANDIDATE- WILL WHICH WE WILL BE DEALING WITH ON THURSDAY WHEN WE DO THE SUSPENSE FIVE OKAY.
