WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO EMPHASIZE ON THE ASSEMBLY AND. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE FUNDING FOR HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. THROUGH S. B. TWO FUNDS ALSO APPRECIATE. INCLUDING ELEMENTS OF OF MY AB THIRTY SEVENTY TWO SO THAT WE CAN SQUEEZE OUT MORE FUNDING THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT. AYE AND. AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE BUDGET YEARS BILL TO PRIORITIZE A ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF SURPLUS FUNDS FOR HOMELESSNESS I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. ALL THAT BEING IN THIS PROPOSAL. THAT BEING SAID. I THINK THEY'RE A LOT OF ELEMENTS OF WHAT THE SENATE HAS PROPOSED IN THIS AREA THAT I APPRECIATE AND I WANT TO. HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS AT FIRST I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE AS SIGNIFICANT AN EMPHASIS AS WE CAN ON PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING ON CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. I WE KNOW THE PRINCIPLE OF HOUSING IS THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS AND I APPRECIATE. THE BALANCING THE PRIORITIES THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS BUT I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO TO FOCUS ON I THINK ADDITIONALLY. ENSURING THAT ANY MONIES THAT GO TO. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT WE HAVE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND THAT WE REQUIRE A CITIES AND COUNTIES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT RECEIVE THESE FUNDS. ARE TO HAVE PLANS FOR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO USE THE MONEY ARE ONE EMPHASIZE THAT. I ALSO A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. THE SENATE'S PRIORITY OF THE HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA PROGRAM WHICH WAS AND ASSEMBLY BILL OUT WHEN THIS PAST THIS PAST YEAR I DO HOPE THAT WE CAN. BRING UP THE FUNDING LEVELS OUT TO WHAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED IN THE SENATE. AND. THE LAST. THE EXCESS RAINY DAY FUNDS ARE THAT I THINK THE ASSEMBLY WE SHOULD JOIN THE SENATE AND PRIORITIZING THOSE FUNDS FOR HOUSING AND FOR HOMELESSNESS. OUT SO I DO HOPE THERE SOME CONSIDERATION OF THAT MOVIE TO THE PROCESS BUT THAT BEING SAID IDO SUPPORT THIS ARE HAPPY TO SEE MOVE FORWARD. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO STAND FOR THE PRINCIPLE AT THIS MOMENT THAT IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. WERE WILLING TO PUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SURPLUS TOWARD THAT END AND SPEND THOSE FUNDS IN SMART WAYS. BUT YOU. IF IT COMES FROM THE COMMITTEE. WE'RE GOING UP NO PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS ITEM.

AND HE SEES ME PARENTS MUST RELOCATE THEIR CHILDREN OUTSIDE OF THE FIFTY MILE RADIUS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY WHICH DISRUPTS SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AND PREVENTS CHILDREN FROM STAYING WITH YOUR RELATIVES IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE YOUR AT ONE SCHOOL. THIS TRAILER BILL AMENDS THE FIFTY MILE RULE TO ONLY APPLY TO THE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD RATHER THAN TO IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS.

IN ADDITION THE TRAILER BILL ALLOWS FOR PROPOSALS TO SET ASIDE UP TO SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE UNITS IN A CENTER FOR FAMILIES WITH SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF THE LOCATION OF THEIR RESIDENTS.

SEVERAL ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED IN THE TO THE BILL OF BEEN THE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION BUT I AND PRIOR DISCUSSIONS BEFORE POLICY COMMITTEES. AND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY STAKEHOLDERS AND FOR THAT REASON LEGISLATION HASN'T MOVED FORWARD ON SOME OF THESE TOPICS.

WE ALSO HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN THIS STATE. I'M ANDREW AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ARE THOSE MIGRANT FAMILIES WHO OTHERWISE DON'T. HAVE PERMANENT HOUSING IN THE AREA WHERE THEY'RE WORKING. THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD AND THAT'S WHY WE CREATED THESE MIGRANTS CENTERS WE'RE HOPING IN. AS THIS MOVES FORWARD. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL TODAY ARM THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO CRAFT LANGUAGE THAT STRIKES OUT BALLOTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MARKET CENTERS ARE AVAILABLE.

CAROLYN SHE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OUT THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL I SPECIFICALLY IT IS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO SUSPEND FOR TWO YEARS THE LOCAL BOND RELATED PROVISIONS IN A. B.. A ONE NINETY FIVE TO ALLOW TIME FOR CONCERTS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE POLICY PROCESS AND NOT AFFECT NEAR TERM ELECTIONS. FINANCE. TAMARA JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE HAVE NO POSITION AT THIS TIME AS WE HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. BUT OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I I HAVE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I WAS THE AUTHOR OF AB ONE NINETY FIVE SO. JUST TAKE A MINUTE AND WALKING THROUGH THE HISTORY OF WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. UP SEVERAL YEARS AGO I AUTHORED A BILL AB EIGHT OR NINE AT THAT WHATEVER THAT REQUIRED. A OUT BALLOT LABELING TRANSPARENCY SO OF THE FEE FEELING WAS IF TAXPAYERS GOING TO VOTE FOR A TAX INCREASE THEY OUGHT TO KNOW THE GOOD STUFF WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET FOR THAT MONEY AND THEY ALL KNOW THE BAD STUFF FOR THE GONNA HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. AND THAT'S JUST AN ISSUE OF BASIC TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS IN ELECTIONS SO I THAT BILL. PASSED AND WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR AB ONE NINETY FIVE LAST YEAR EXTENDED THE PROVISIONS OF THAT BILL TO BOND ISSUES AND AT THE TIME IT WAS EXTREMELY UNCONTROVERSIAL. HOWEVER IN THE MEANTIME. WE'VE BECOME AWARE OF SOME. SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE APPLICATION OF AB ONE NINETY FIVE DIVINE LIKE WHICH SO I'VE A BILL THIS YEAR AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY EIGHT THAT SEEKS TO A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. AND NOW WE HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH THOSE ISSUES. WE WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS I'M HIGHLY CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE GONNA GET TO A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE AGREES. AND. IF WE PUT URGENCY ON THAT BILL OR WE HAVE A VEHICLE IN THE SENATE THAT WE CAN USE BUT WE WILL GET WE WILL BE ABLE TO DELIVER THAT SOLUTION TO. EVERY BIT AS QUICKLY AS. AS WE GO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS SO I WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEES. THE COMMITTEES RESPECT AND FORBEARANCE IN A DELAYING. TAKING ACTION THROUGH THE BUDGET ON THIS AND GIVING US A CHANCE TO US ALL THIS LEGISLATIVE WEEKS I THINK THAT'S THE MORE APPROPRIATE WAY OF DOING IT. YOU QUESTIONS ARE GOING UP AND UP PUBLIC COMMENT ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK ON THE SIDE. MISTER CHAIR COULD I JUST CLARIFY I'M I'M WHICH MISTER EVERETT PULLED. UP HERE ASKING FOR US TO NOT ADOPT THIS TODAY. A YES I HAVE LANGUAGE I CAN PASS IT AROUND THIS IS OTHER HOT OFF THE PRESS FROM WHICH COUNSEL THIS IS THE IN IN. ARE THE RESULT OF OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND I'M I'M HIGHLY CONFIDENT WE'RE GOING TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE. WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND KEEP EVERYONE AYE HAPPY SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE. IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT THOUGH IF THIS MOVES FORWARD THAT COMMUTERS CAUTION. LATER IN THE PROCESS RIGHT IF WE DON'T MOVE IT FOR TODAY THAN WE DON'T HAVE THE OPTION OF CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION HERE. YES BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT. YOU KNOW THE STATUS QUO IS. IS A LITTLE CUMBERSOME BUT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED TODAY IS TO COMPLETELY EXEMPT BOND MEASURES FROM ANY KIND OF DISCLOSURE. ON THE BALLOT LABEL WHICH I THINK IS A FAR WORSE. FAR WORSE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. SO SO IS JUST A RECOMMENDATIONS A TWO YEAR SUSPENSION NOT TOTALLY DO AWAY WITH IT. OKAY IT'S PUBLIC COMMENT NAKED AFTERNOON STEVE CREWS ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN JOSE AND SAN JOSE MAYOR'S OFFICE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL. AND. MISTER OBERNOLTE APPRECIATIVE OF THE EFFORTS THAT YOU MADE THIS YEAR WE HAVE NOT BEEN INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU BUT. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOUR. LANGUAGE IS MORE LIMITED THAN WHAT'S PROPOSED JUST IN TERMS OF. THERE A FULL BOND EXEMPTION AND AS THE CHAIR POINTED OUT IT IS A TEMPORARY BASES AND I KNOW FOR THE CITY WE'VE SEEN FIRST HAND. OF THE POLLING WHERE WE'VE SEEN AS MUCH OF A TWELVE PERCENT FLIP. WHEN THE VOTERS. WERE. PROVIDE YOU WITH THE INFORMATION AND I UNDERSTAND THE TRANSPARENCY OF ABOUT INFORMATION IS REQUIRED IN THE PAMPHLET. THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU PUT IN THE SEVENTY FIVE WORD LABEL YOU OCCUPY NO TWO THIRDS OF THE SPACE IN YOU'RE LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY DESCRIBE WHAT THE BOND DOES. AND THEN RUN INTO MECHANICAL ISSUES OF UNDER ABLE TO TO DETERMINE WHAT BOND RATES ARE AT A GIVEN TIME BECAUSE THEY FLUCTUATE. A WHAT THEY OVER OVER THE LIFE OF THE BOND SO. THOSE ARE ISSUES OF CONCERN WE UNDERSTAND THE TRANSPARENCY WHEN I TRY TO TAKE AWAY WITH THAT WE THINK THAT. THE PROPOSAL THAT'S ON THE TABLE ALLOW FOR THAT PROCESS TO BE CONSIDERED. AND. THE FACT IT'S TO THE BUDGET PROCESS ADDRESSES THE URGENCY OF ITS I DON'T SEE IT AS A WE HAVE POTENTIALLY SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS PRETTY NOVEMBER. AND THAT WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THE. THIS PROPOSAL COULD BE PASSED BEFORE THAT'S APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DAVID JOHNSON HAVE THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO WE SHARE THE CONCERNS OF SAN JOSE.

WE'RE GOING CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT. MISTER OBERNOLTE I THINK MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD JUST BRIEFLY WERE BUT A COUPLE OF THE POINTS THAT WERE RAISED. BOB FIRST OF ALL IT WAS MENTIONED THAT UNDER THE CURRENT INTERPRETATION OF AB ONE NINETY FIVE THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE BALLOT LABEL IS DEVOTED TO THE DISCLOSURE AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S ۷E ACTUALLY THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF BONDS THAT PASSED LAST YEAR THAT WERE IN COMPLIANCE THAT THAT. ARTFULLY CRAFTED IN A. IF I COULD ALL PASSAGE AROUND THESE ARE. THIS IS WHAT WAS DONE LAST YEAR IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH AB IN ONE NINETY FIVE AND THE LANGUAGE THAT WE'RE PROPOSING AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY EIGHT. YOU'RE GONNA PULL ON A BOND MEASURE OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO PULL BETTER IF YOU TELL PEOPLE HEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO ISSUE A BOND TO BUILD A NEW ATHLETIC COMPLEX FOR OUR COLLEGE. AND YOU DON'T TELL THEM THAT IT'S GOING TO RAISE THEIR TAXES OF COURSE IT'S GONNA PULL BETTER BUT I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. TO BE OPEN TRANSPARENT AND FAIR WITH THEM ABOUT THE BENEFIT THAT THEY'RE GETTING AND WHAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR IT. AND THAT WAS THE POINT OF AB ONE NINETY FIVE AND I'M I'M HIGHLY CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE GONNA GET TO A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION THAT MAKES EVERYONE HAPPY HERE. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU.
