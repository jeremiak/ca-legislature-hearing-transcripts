EIGHTY FIVE WILL DO FOR

00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:03.816

AND THROWING OUT THE NEWSPAPERS

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:45.324
AND TO THINK THAT THAT WHOLE

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.258
FAMILY WORKING TOGETHER IS

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:48.360
MAKING THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR IS

00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:50.629

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:49.721

LIKE TO SAY THAT I'VE HAD THE

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.165
DISTINCT PROVISION HONOR OF

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:35.901
HAVING A FRONT ROW SEAT

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:36.435
WATCHING A SUMMER LEARNING

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:39.338
GONZALEZ. AS AS SHE HAS FOUGHT

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:41.106
HARDER THAN ANYONE I'VE EVER

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:45.143
SEEN IN MY LIFE FOR WORKERS.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.679
AND WAY THAT SOME POWERFUL THE

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:48.313
WAY THAT IN A MATTER WHAT SHE'S

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:53.518
BEEN. DILLON EYES DEMONIZED.

00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:55.854
AND YET CONTINUES TO FIGHT

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:56.955
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT SHE'S

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:59.524
FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T

00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:00.158
HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE SIGNING UP

00:21:00.225 --> 00:21:04.529
FOR THEM. FOR THE SENATE TO PUT

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.131
HER IN THIS POSITION I THINK IS

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:09.434
BENEATH. DIGNITY OF LEGISLATION

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:14.172
WE SERVICE. I GET POLITICS I

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:16.642
UNDERSTAND THAT HAPPENS I

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:20.412
UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE RULES

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:20.946
OF PROCEDURES AND WE HAVE

00:21:21.013 --> 00:21:23.849
DIFFERENT WAYS FOR. LEGISLATORS

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:25.417
TO BE ABLE TO PUSH THEIR AGENDA

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:25.951
AND I GET ALL THAT I'M NOT

00:21:26.018 --> 00:21:29.554
NAIVE TO THE- BUT FOR THEM TO

00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:32.858
DO THIS TO OUR COLLEAGUE. WAS

00:21:32.924 --> 00:21:35.027
ALWAYS HOLD HER SUB HIGH ENOUGH

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:37.562
THAT HONORABLY AND I'M IN A IN

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:42.701
A SELFLESS MANNER. I THINK IS.

00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:43.869
I UNDERSTAND THE POSITION

00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:45.303
RUNNING AS WELL WHICH IS IT IS

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.638
IT THIS IS NOT JUST OF THE

00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:48.507
PROPOSITION THAT. THE AUTHORS

00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:50.609
PUT AND IT'S IT IS DIFFICULT

00:21:50.676 --> 00:21:52.811
JUST NOT BUT IT'S AWESOME. AND

00:21:52.878 --> 00:21:55.147
OUR SPEAKER AND OF THE ASSEMBLY

00:21:55.213 --> 00:21:58.884
AS A WHOLE BECAUSE. OF THE

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.688
MANNER IN WHICH. THIS BILL IS

00:22:02.754 --> 00:22:04.256
MOVE FORWARD AND I GET THE LOOK

00:22:04.322 --> 00:22:05.290
THIS INDUSTRY IS NOT UNIQUE

00:22:05.357 --> 00:22:05.791
THERE'S DOZENS OF OTHER

00:22:05.857 --> 00:22:07.926
INDUSTRIES THAT I'VE- ASKED

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:08.393
MORE TIME AND ASK FOR

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.395
EXEMPTIONS IS SO. THIS IS ONE

00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:11.396
OF MANY BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS

00:22:11.463 --> 00:22:13.732
THAT THIS INDUSTRY DOES HAVE. A

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:17.469
LOT OF POWER AND INFLUENCE AND

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:18.036
THAT'S ALSO IS NOT SOMETHING

00:22:18.103 --> 00:22:21.339
UNIQUE TO. TODAY THAT'S

00:22:21.406 --> 00:22:24.009
CERTAINLY NOT IN THIS BUILDING.

00:22:24.076 --> 00:22:25.944
I DO TAKE THE INDUSTRY HAS

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.379
WORDING CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:30.315
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE- HOPE TO

00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:33.018
ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS YEAR.

00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:35.654
THERE'S GREAT OPPORTUNITY IN IN

00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:38.457
EVEN EVEN IF THE PROCESS IS A

00:22:38.523 --> 00:22:40.926
MESSY ONE THAT WE DON'T. WE

00:22:40.992 --> 00:22:44.362
DON'T LIKE. IT DOESN'T MEAN

00:22:44.429 --> 00:22:44.963
THAT THE END RESULT HAS TO BE

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.399
SOMETHING WE DON'T LIKE. AND SO

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:50.902
COME. YOU KNOW I'M CERTAINLY

00:22:50.969 --> 00:22:52.871
COMMITTED TO ENSURE THAT THIS

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:57.943
pTHAT WE THINK ABOUT THE WORKER

00:22:58.009 --> 00:22:58.643
AND THE WORKERS THAT ARE

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.379
STRUGGLING WHEN WE THINK ABOUT.

00:23:01.446 --> 00:23:01.947
WHAT WE WANT AND RESOLVED TO

00:23:02.013 --> 00:23:05.250
LOOK LIKE. THE NEW CIVIC

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:06.585
INDUSTRY USUALLY PLACES A

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:08.320
SPOTLIGHT ON OTHERS AND AS

00:23:08.386 --> 00:23:11.156
INDICATED BY SOME JONES SAWYER.

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:12.624
THE SPOTLIGHT IS NOW ON ON THEM

00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:16.228
IN TERMS OF. HOW THIS NEXT YEAR

00:23:16.294 --> 00:23:20.699
WILL LOOK LIKE AS IT RELATES.

00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:21.266
TO MISS CLASSIFICATION AS IT

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:25.103
RELATES TO THE. I NAPA DYNAMICS

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.806
AND THE WORK THAT THE

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:28.774
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK THE

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.308
NOT JUST SOME RUDY SALAS HAS

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:31.743
BROUGH THIS FOR THE SPEAKER'S

OFFICE. CERTAINLY MY STAFF HERE

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:36.648
THE LABOR COMMITTEE BUT ALSO

THE LABOR FEDERATION THE

00:23:37.449 --> 00:23:39.251
BUILDING TRADES AND THIS IS NOT

00:23:39.317 --> 00:23:40.519
THE THERE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:41.987
AMOUNT OF WORK PUTTING TRYING

00:23:42.053 --> 00:23:43.688
TO GET IT RIGHT AND WE KNOW

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:44.289
WE'RE NOT PERFECT WE KNOW THAT

00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:45.490
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET

00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:48.593
EVERYTHING RIGHT. BUT BUT WE DO

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.194
KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:50.862
REALLY HARD I KNOW THAT ARE

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:53.832
AUTHOR OF AB FIVE IS BEEN

00:23:53.899 --> 00:23:57.602
TRYING HARDER THAN. ANYONE TO

00:23:57.669 --> 00:24:00.972
TRY TO GET IT RIGHT. THE

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:02.541
WORKERS AND TO RESPECT THE

00:24:02.607 --> 00:24:03.575
SUPREME COURT AS WELL AND THEIR

00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:06.077
DECISION. WHICH WE CAN'T LOSE

00:24:06.144 --> 00:24:07.612
SIGHT OF THAT IF WE DO NOTHING

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:08.146
AB FIVE DOESN'T. ONCE THAT

00:24:08.213 --> 00:24:10.382
HAPPENS. THAT EVERYBODY HAS A.

00:24:10.448 --> 00:24:12.017
B. C. TEST SO IT'S NOT A MATTER

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:12.651
OF JUST TRYING TO STICK IT TO

00:24:12.717 --> 00:24:13.251
ONE GROUP ONE INDUSTRY OR THE

00:24:13.318 --> 00:24:15.487
OTHER. AND THIS IS NOT A MATTER

00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:18.657
OF. OF TELLING NEWSPAPERS ANY

00:24:18.723 --> 00:24:23.762
OTHER INDUSTRY TO. TO NOT BE

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:26.965
INCLUDED BUT BECAUSE THERE'S-

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:28.133
AN ISSUE WITH OPTICAL

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.034
INDUSTRIES BECAUSE THIS IS A

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.837
VERY COMPLEX VERY COMPLICATED.

00:24:31.903 --> 00:24:33.405
AND THE DAY THE MUSIC INDUSTRY

00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:35.440
ITSELF IS NOT A MONOLITH AND IT

00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:36.975
HAS A LOT OF COMPLEXITY TO IT

00:24:37.042 --> 00:24:39.611
AS WELL. AND I UNDERSTAND THE

00:24:39.678 --> 00:24:41.046
CHALLENGES INCLUDING IT MAYBE

00:24:41.112 --> 00:24:42.714
FIVE OF THOSE REASONS. BUT WE

00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:50.455
HAVE. HERE SB ONE SEVENTY AND.

00:24:50.522 --> 00:24:54.025
I JUST I JUST HOPE THAT AS A

00:24:54.092 --> 00:24:54.559
LEGISLATIVE BODY WE CAN DO

00:24:54.626 --> 00:24:56.328
BETTER THAT WE DO BETTER. YOU

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:58.163
DO BETTER BY OUR COLLEAGUES.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.699
BECAUSE ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES

00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:03.301
IS ARE BETTER BUT- ESPECIALLY

00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:06.771
SOME AMERICANS OFFICERS BETTER.

00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:13.245
THAN THAN THIS AND SO. WE HAVE

00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:18.416
A MOTION TO THE. CURRENT

00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:21.987
STABILITY THE. CORRECT WITHOUT

00:25:22.053 --> 00:25:23.722
RECOMMENDATION IS MY

00:25:23.788 --> 00:25:24.322
RECOMMENDATION BUT THE MOTION

00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:31.029
IS. THE PAST WITH THE WORD

00:25:31.096 --> 00:25:34.900
RECEPTIVE. THE GROUND

00:25:34.966 --> 00:25:35.433
CONCURRENT CURRENTS OF THE

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.904
CURRENT LAW CENTER. YEAH AND

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.240
YEAH OF COURSE AND SO BUT AFTER

00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:43.241
THE ALSO HAS AN OPPORTUNITY

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:47.145
CLOSE AND CONNECTED YES I JUST

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:48.847

00:25:48.914 --> 00:25:54.085
IT WAS FORCED TO TAKE THIS BILL.

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:54.719
BUT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT I WOULD

00:25:54.786 --> 00:25:59.424
NOT SO. AND THAT'S A HIGHLY

00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:04.296
UNUSUAL SITUATION BUT IT'S.

00:26:04.362 --> 00:26:06.564
WOULD BE FOR ME TO ACTUALLY

00:26:06.631 --> 00:26:13.204
CONTEST GIVEN. ZERO EIGHTY FIVE

00:26:13.271 --> 00:26:14.105
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:15.941
MIGHT MAKING THEIR HIKES WITH

00:26:16.007 --> 00:26:17.676
PIECEMEAL BUT FACT IT WASN'T

00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:19.377
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF THINGS

00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:20.946
WE CONSIDERED IN WAYS WE LOOK

00:26:21.012 --> 00:26:22.681
AT INDUSTRIES THE NUMBER ONE

00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:25.083
TEAM HOW HARD HOW HIGH IS THE

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:26.918
BARRIER TO ENTRY IN A

00:26:26.985 --> 00:26:27.419
PROFESSION BUT WOULD BE

00:26:27.485 --> 00:26:28.286
EXEMPTED BECAUSE THE HIGHER THE

00:26:28.353 --> 00:26:31.022
BARRIERS TO ENTRY OF COURSE THE

00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:34.125
MORE INDIVIDUAL LEVERAGED AN

IN. HOUSE FOR PARDON ME. WE

00:26:38.496 --> 00:26:40.598
LOOKED AT HOW MUCH PEOPLE MADE

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:41.466
AND IN FACT. THOUGHT THAT YOU

00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:44.536
SHOULD BE MAKING JUST LIKE OUR.

00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:45.537
OUR STATE LAW REQUIRES TWICE
