TO BE HAD. SO THIS BILL ADDS A

01:45:21.748 --> 01:45:24.251
COUPLE MORE PROFESSIONS TO THE

01:45:24.317 --> 01:45:26.353
LIST OF INDUSTRIES THAT ARE

01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:29.389
GOOD EXAMPLES. FOR OUR

01:45:29.456 --> 01:45:32.092
GOVERNMENT BY THE CARRILLO TEST.

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:32.659
FORTUNE IT ALL STRAIGHT ONE

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:35.262

01:45:41.568 --> 01:45:43.437

INSURANCE AGENTS BUT LET ME

01:45:54.581 --> 01:45:55.248
SUGGEST THAT THE WAY THAT THE

01:45:55.315 --> 01:45:57.884
BILL SHOULD WORK IN THE WAY

01:45:57.951 --> 01:45:59.119
THAT STATE COACH WOULD WORK.

01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:00.387
THAT WOULD BE FINE- PLAN WORK

01:46:00.454 --> 01:46:02.789
THAT WAY. EVERYBODY AND I A

01:46:02.856 --> 01:46:06.526
COUPLE SUBJECT IN THAT LINE I.

01:46:06.593 --> 01:46:07.828
THE WE EXPAND THE PROFESSIONS

01:46:07.894 --> 01:46:09.663
UNDER AB FIVE TO CALL ALL OF

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:11.298
THE PROFESSIONS IN THE BUSINESS

01:46:11.364 --> 01:46:12.833
AND PROFESSIONS CODE THOSE ARE

01:46:12.899 --> 01:46:14.067
PROFESSIONS THAT ALREADY HAVE

01:46:14.134 --> 01:46:15.902
CODE SECTIONS DEDICATED TO THEM

01:46:15.969 --> 01:46:18.805
WE CAN LEGISLATE- TWEAKS TO.

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:20.440
THE RULES FOR THOSE INDUSTRIES

01:46:20.507 --> 01:46:22.142
UNDER THE BNP CODE I DON'T

01:46:22.209 --> 01:46:23.677
THINK THAT WE NEED TO GO

01:46:23.744 --> 01:46:25.612
INDUSTRY- UP A BY INDUSTRY IN-

01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:27.981
THE FRAMEWORK OF AB FIVE. I

01:46:28.048 --> 01:46:29.116
ALSO THINK WHAT'S BADLY NEEDED

01:46:29.182 --> 01:46:31.618
HIS BIGGEST TURN FOR HIGHLY

01:46:31.685 --> 01:46:33.720
SKILLED WORKERS. THAT IS

01:46:33.787 --> 01:46:34.221
SOMETHING WE WOULDN'T BE

01:46:34.287 --> 01:46:35.088
INVENTING THE WHEEL THAT'S ARE

01:46:35.155 --> 01:46:37.324
FAR AND STATE CODE IN THE WAGE.

01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:38.992
ARE THOSE. THAT HAVE THE POWER

01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:41.461
TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEIR

01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:46.199
EMPLOYERS AND I THINK THAT AN

01:46:46.266 --> 01:46:49.136
EXEMPTION FOR THEM WOULD REALLY

01:46:49.202 --> 01:46:50.704
HELP TO CLICK. BY THE BIG. SO

01:46:50.771 --> 01:46:52.906
AB FIVE IS IT SAYS THAT. IF

01:46:52.973 --> 01:46:54.474
YOUR WORKERS PERFORMING WORK

01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:56.209
THAT'S IN THE USUAL COURSE OF A

01:46:56.276 --> 01:46:57.644
BUSINESS FOR A COMPANY THAT

01:46:57.711 --> 01:46:59.479
COMPANY CANNOT CLASSIFY THEM.

01:46:59.546 --> 01:47:02.115
AS EMPTY AS A- CONTRACTOR BUT

01:47:02.182 --> 01:47:04.317
WE NEVER DEFINE. WHAT USUAL

01:47:04.384 --> 01:47:05.685
COURSE OF BUSINESS MEANS AND

01:47:05.752 --> 01:47:07.320
UNFORTUNATELY AT LACK OF

01:47:07.387 --> 01:47:09.089
SPECIFICITY JUST THROWS IT OPEN

01:47:09.156 --> 01:47:09.990
TO THE COURT. THE

01:47:10.056 --> 01:47:11.091
INTERPRETATION OF THAT CODE

01:47:11.158 --> 01:47:12.726
SECTION AND FRANKLY THAT IS THE

01:47:12.793 --> 01:47:14.060
PROBLEM THAT LED TO THE

01:47:14.127 --> 01:47:15.896
ORIGINAL WORLD DECISION. AND

01:47:15.962 --> 01:47:17.063
THE DYNAMICS DECISION IS THIS

01:47:17.130 --> 01:47:23.837
LEGISLATURE'S. TO DEFINE IT

01:47:23.904 --> 01:47:26.606
STATE CODE EXACTLY REMAIN. TO

01:47:26.673 --> 01:47:28.208
FIX THE PROBLEM. AND THEN

01:47:28.275 --> 01:47:29.509
LASTLY LET ME SAY THAT WE BADLY

01:47:29.576 --> 01:47:31.611
NEED TO CREATE A SMALL BUSINESS

01:47:31.678 --> 01:47:33.880
EXEMPTION IN AB FIVE. YOU KNOW

01:47:33.947 --> 01:47:35.215
THE THIRTY YEARS AGO I STARTED

01:47:35.282 --> 01:47:36.349
A COMPANY OUT OF MY COLLEGE

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:39.820
DORM ROOM I CAN TELL YOU WITH

01:47:39.886 --> 01:47:41.955
1100% CERTAINTY I WOULD NOT

01:47:42.022 --> 01:47:42.923
HAVE BEEN IT. AB FIVE THEN THE

01:47:42.989 --> 01:47:45.025
LAW AND- COLLEAGUES IS TOO HARD

01:47:45.091 --> 01:47:47.093

COMPLY WITH A COMPLEX FRAMEWORK

01:47:50.597 --> 01:47:51.631
AND DELETIONS THAT THAT

01:47:51.698 --> 01:47:54.968
ENTAILS. SO I FEAR. THAT AB

01:47:55.035 --> 01:47:57.037

01:47:57.103 --> 01:47:58.238
THAT IS REALLY GOING TO HAVE A

01:47:58.305 --> 01:47:59.539
DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON

01:47:59.606 --> 01:48:00.907
ENTREPRENEUR REALLY. CALIFORNIA

01:48:00.974 --> 01:48:03.143
UNFORTUNATELY. COMPANIES THAT

THAT AT THAT ARE CREATED HERE

01:48:04.244 --> 01:48:05.478
AND THE JOBS THAT WOULD HAVE

01:48:05.545 --> 01:48:06.880
BEEN ADDED HERE WILL STILL BE

01:48:06.947 --> 01:48:08.448
CREATED. BUT THEY'LL BE CREATED

PROSPERITY THAT COMES WITH THEM

01:48:11.017 --> 01:48:13.720

SHOULDER TO SHOULDER IN THE

02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:48.426

ONES. THE WORK THEY DO IS HARD.

02:27:55.333 --> 02:27:56.133
IT BREAKS DOWN THE BODY OVER

02:27:56.200 --> 02:27:59.136
TIME MY GRANDFATHER WHO RAISED

02:27:59.203 --> 02:28:02.240
ME THE FARM WORKER. AND I SAW

02:28:02.306 --> 02:28:07.778
HOW HARD. HE WORKED FOR FIFTY

02:28:07.845 --> 02:28:08.346

BARELY ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE

02:28:18.556 --> 02:28:21.459
ENDS MEET. AND IS NOW MANY

02:28:21.525 --> 02:28:23.361
FARMWORKERS ARE UNDOCUMENTED.

02:28:23.427 --> 02:28:25.096
HERE CALIFORNIA AND IN THE

02:28:25.162 --> 02:28:27.999
UNITED STATES. THEY LACK ACCESS

02:28:28.065 --> 02:28:30.167
TO THE HEALTH CARE THAT MANY OF

02:28:30.234 --> 02:28:31.969
US TAKE FOR GRANTED.

02:28:32.036 --> 02:28:33.204
UNFORTUNATELY CHRONIC HEALTH

02:28:33.271 --> 02:28:36.574
CONDITIONS. AMONG FARMWORKERS

02:28:36.641 --> 02:28:38.609
ARE VERY VERY COMMON. AND

02:28:38.676 --> 02:28:40.911
VIRUSES VIRUSES CAN SPREAD

02:28:40.978 --> 02:28:44.615
QUICKLY. YOU SEE IT'S NOT JUST

02:28:44.682 --> 02:28:47.318
THAT FARMWORKERS WORKING CLOSE

02:28:47.385 --> 02:28:49.954
PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER. IS

02:28:50.021 --> 02:28:51.922
THAT THEY HANDLE THAT YOU KNOW

02:28:51.989 --> 02:28:54.725
THE SAME EQUIPMENT AND- THE

02:28:54.792 --> 02:28:56.994
TRACTORS IN THE MACHINES THAT

02:28:57.061 --> 02:29:00.464
THEY USE BUT THEY ALSO LIVE IN

02:29:00.531 --> 02:29:03.067
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER.

02:29:03.134 --> 02:29:04.568
AT LEAST ONE APARTMENT OR A

02:29:04.635 --> 02:29:06.570
SINGLE FAMILY HOME WHERE

02:29:06.637 --> 02:29:07.838
WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO

02:29:07.905 --> 02:29:12.209
SUBLET ROOMS GARAGES SHEDS

02:29:12.276 --> 02:29:12.677
WHATEVER SPACE IS MADE

02:29:12.743 --> 02:29:15.146
AVAILABLE. HERE THE GOAL OF THE

02:29:15.212 --> 02:29:17.415
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF SOMEONE

02:29:17.481 --> 02:29:19.183
GETS SICK IT'S HARD TO KEEP

02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:22.186
THEM SEPARATED CAN'T SHELTER IN

02:29:22.253 --> 02:29:24.055
PLACE THE CAT SOCIAL DISTANCE.

02:29:24.121 --> 02:29:25.356
AND AS LONG AS THE PANDEMIC

02:29:25.423 --> 02:29:28.125
CONTINUES OUR FARMWORKERS ARE

02:29:28.192 --> 02:29:31.228
AT RISK AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE A

02:29:31.295 --> 02:29:32.930
MORAL DUTY TO PROTECT OUR MOST

02:29:32.997 --> 02:29:35.566
VULNERABLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:29:35.633 --> 02:29:37.702
AND IS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER

02:29:37.768 --> 02:29:40.004
OTHER FOOD RELATED INDUSTRIES.

02:29:40.071 --> 02:29:41.706
A COVERT NINETEEN OUTBREAK IN

02:29:41.772 --> 02:29:44.208
OUR FARM WORKER. POPULATIONS IN

02:29:44.275 --> 02:29:48.479
OUR OUT COMMUNITIES THEY WOULD

02:29:48.546 --> 02:29:50.047
THREATEN OUR FOOD SUPPLY NOT

02:29:50.114 --> 02:29:52.783
ONLY OUR STATE FOOD SUPPLY OUR

02:29:52.850 --> 02:29:56.354
NATIONAL FOOD SUPPLY. FARMERS I

02:29:56.420 --> 02:29:56.887
THERE ARE PARTNERS IN THIS

02:29:56.954 --> 02:30:00.157
EFFORT. MOST OF THEM UNDERSTAND

02:30:00.224 --> 02:30:02.093
THE RISK THAT THEIR WORKERS

02:30:02.159 --> 02:30:03.594
THAT FARM WORKERS FACE EVERY

02:30:03.661 --> 02:30:04.862
SINGLE DAY THEY CARE ABOUT

02:30:04.929 --> 02:30:06.230
THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEY WANT

02:30:06.297 --> 02:30:08.699
TO KEEP THEM SAFE. THE PROBLEM

02:30:08.766 --> 02:30:10.901
IS THAT OUR STATE OUR COUNTRY

02:30:10.968 --> 02:30:12.770
WE WERE CLEARLY UNPREPARED TO

02:30:12.837 --> 02:30:15.072
HANDLE THE HISTORIC. PUBLIC

02:30:15.139 --> 02:30:17.608
HEALTH CRISIS. THAT WE'RE

02:30:17.675 --> 02:30:20.144
EXPERIENCING. AND RIGHT NOW WE

02:30:20.211 --> 02:30:22.179
HAVE A PATCHWORK OF SAFETY

02:30:22.246 --> 02:30:25.349
GUIDANCE ACROSS OUR STATE. AND

02:30:25.416 --> 02:30:27.451
SUCH GUIDES CAN BE DIFFERENT

02:30:27.518 --> 02:30:29.820
FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. AND IT'S

02:30:29.887 --> 02:30:31.255
NOT ALWAYS CLEAR OR

02:30:31.322 --> 02:30:33.624
STANDARDIZED AND SO THIS BILL

02:30:33.691 --> 02:30:35.393
IS DESIGNED TO CREATE A CLEAR

02:30:35.459 --> 02:30:38.996
UNIFORM STANDARD. THAT APPLIES

02:30:39.063 --> 02:30:39.597
TO ALL AGRICULTURAL WORKERS IN

02:30:39.663 --> 02:30:42.733
CALIFORNIA. IT'LL MAKE THINGS

02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:44.668
EASIER FOR FARMERS WANT TO

02:30:44.735 --> 02:30:47.204
IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES. IT'LL

02:30:47.271 --> 02:30:49.240
KEEP FARMWORKERS SAFEWHICH IS

02:30:49.306 --> 02:30:51.509
IN EVERYONE'S BEST INTEREST. WE

02:30:51.575 --> 02:30:53.377
SHOULD BE MAKING THE SAFETY

02:30:53.444 --> 02:30:54.745
THESE GUYS DECISIONS ON A

02:30:54.812 --> 02:30:56.447
COUNTY BY COUNTY LEVEL IT'S TOO

02:30:56.514 --> 02:30:58.749
INCONSISTENT TWO ONE EVEN IT'S

02:30:58.816 --> 02:31:00.184
TOO COMPLICATED FOR FARMERS AND

02:31:00.251 --> 02:31:03.087
IT LEAVES TOO MANY FARMWORKERS

02:31:03.154 --> 02:31:04.822
AND THEIR FAMILIES AT RISK. WE

02:31:04.889 --> 02:31:07.191
NEED A SINGLE A BUS AT.

02:31:07.258 --> 02:31:08.526
GUIDELINES TO PROTECT

02:31:08.592 --> 02:31:11.061

IN NINETEEN. THIS LEGISLATION

02:31:14.365 --> 02:31:17.268
IT DOES THAT BY ADDRESSING THIS

02:31:17.334 --> 02:31:19.737
ISSUE IN THREE WAYS FIRST. IT

02:31:19.804 --> 02:31:24.542
REQUIRES AT AND CAL OSHA ARE

02:31:24.608 --> 02:31:26.277

EXCUSE ME THE DECEPTICON THEN

ON THEIR OWN ARE NOT

02:31:33.584 --> 02:31:36.320
ENFORCEABLE. AND SO SECOND THE

02:31:36.387 --> 02:31:37.655
BILL ALSO DIRECTS CAL OSHA

02:31:37.721 --> 02:31:39.323
