I'VE BEEN CHAIR THE CALIBRATE BOARD SINCE IT LAUNCHED AND IT'S- IT'S BEEN VERY CHALLENGING. HE AND WE UNFORTUNATELY THE INITIAL LEADERSHIP DID NOT ACHIEVE ALL HE WANTED TO ACHIEVE AND- BUT WE HAVE A NEW TEAM IN PLACE NOW THAT IS THAT IS MAKING A LOT OF PRESS VERY QUICKLY. AND SAYING IT'S I THINK IT'S REALLY MOST IMPORTANT CALIBRATE IS THAT IT REALLY DOES OFFER A UNIQUE SERVICE IT'S NOT OFFERED AMONG OUR OTHER. COLLEGES IT. I DON'T SEE DAIS EDUCATION MODEL THAT THEY USE IS NOT REPLICATED ANYWHERE. IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND- THE- IT'S NEEDED NOW MORE THAN EVER- AS SOFT AS THEIR NUMBERS OF PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED. AND EVERYBODY'S BEEN FORCED TO GO ONLINE AND THAT'S WHAT COUNTY WAS PRECISELY DESIGNED FOR WAS TO HELP PEOPLE THAT ARE THEY NEED TO GET A FEW A LITTLE ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND MORE SKILLS WITHOUT THE ECONOMIC LADDER. AND IT'S BEEN. GREAT THROUGH AND I THINK WE'VE WE'VE TURNED THE CORNER ON. LINE I. MAKE DISTANCE IF YOU ENTER CAN- CAN PROGRESS AND ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS- I AM. YOU KNOW I DO AND I. HAS ALSO SAY THAT THE OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES DO A GREAT JOB OF- OF THIS KIND OF CAREER TRAINING BUT THEY DO IT JUST IN A DIFFERENT WAY FOR THE ALMOST. COMPLETE I AN S. AND- ANY THOUGH BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS AN ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE AMONG THE ALL THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- ONLY HALF OF THEM EVEN PARTICIPATE IN IT LEGISLATURE FUNDED OUT SEVERAL ON OUR- BUT HALF THE COLLEGES DON'T EVEN BREAK PARTICIPATE IN THAT AND SO. THE COLLEGES HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO BECOME- REALLY- THE CHRISTIAN AND AN ONLINE EDUCATION AND HELP RIGHT. WE WERE THE ENDEAVOR TO I'M NEW GROUND DEVELOP NEW TECHNIQUES THAT. IT WILL THEN BE SURE TO THE OTHER COLLEGES IN FACT CALIBER OUR- PARTNERSHIP. TO THE MANY COLLEGES ONE IN. AND ONE ON. SO WHAT MORE THAN. AS CALIBRATE PLOWS IS BROWN AND DEVELOPS NEW WAYS DOING THAT- WE CAN SHARE THAT KNOWLEDGE OF THE OTHER COLLEGES AND THAT THEY CAN- THEY CAN GAIN FROM THAT KNOWLEDGE AND OFF.
