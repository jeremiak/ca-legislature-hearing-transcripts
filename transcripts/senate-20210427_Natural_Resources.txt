TO- WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR DODD POLICE PRESENT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I WANT TO START OUT BY SAYING THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS DESCRIBED ON PAGE FOUR IN THE ANALYSIS. SECOND I WOULD LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO ADOPT THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THAT RESULTED FROM MY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CHAIR AND TAG. LIMIT THE USE OF- STE. KEEP GOING OKAY. CM SLASH G. C. N. DESIGN BUILD TO SEVEN PROJECTS EACH IT ENSURE THAT STATE OVERSIGHT FOR CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION ON A IN DESIGN BUILD PROJECTS ADDITIONALLY CENTER STERN AND I HAVE TALKED AND COMMIT TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF AD INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP TRANSPARENT FORTY REQUIREMENTS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. THESE AMENDMENTS WILL ENSURE CONTROL OVER THE NUMBER PROJECTS CONTRACTING WORK OUT UNDER THIS EXPANDED AUTHORITY PROVIDED THE D. W. R. AND MOST MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE AUTHORITY BEING GRANTED TO D. W. R. WITH THE SAME STATE OVERSIGHT ON INSPECTIONS. PROVIDED THE CALTRANS. SB SIX TWO SIX WOULD AUTHORIZE THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES D. W. R. TO USE DESIGN BUILDING CONSTRUCTION MANAGER- THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR PROCUREMENT METHODS FOR PROJECT DELIVERY FOR FACILITIES THE STATE WATER PROJECT. EXCLUDING THE DELTA CONVEYANCE. IT WOULD BE TO STOP HERE BECAUSE I THINK I'D STARTED DOING THIS C. N. G. C. STUFF- THAT DEFINITION JUST TO WORK. THIS IS- A CONSTRUCTION MANAGER GENERAL CONTRACTOR PROCUREMENT METHOD SO I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT MAKING THAT CLEAR AT THE TOP. DESIGN BUILD IS A CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDER PROCESS UNDER A ONE COUNTRY. UNDER PAGE ONE CONTRACT IS ENTERED INTO FOR BOTH THE DESIGN OF THE PROJECT AS WELL AS THE CONSTRUCTION THE DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY HAS THE AUTHORITY FOR PROJECTS ONLY AT THE SALTON SEA. C. M. G. C. INVOLVES THE SELECTION OF OCCUR CONSTRUCTION MANAGER WHO ADVISES THE DEPARTMENT DURING THE DESIGN PHASE TO MAXIMIZE EFFICIENT CONSTRUCTED BILITY. OF THE PROJECT IN QUESTION ONCE DESIGNED THE C. N. G. C. PROCESS PROVIDES THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGER A RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL FOR THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT. TOGETHER THESE PROCESSES WILL PROVIDE D. W. R. WITH GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN EXPERTISE WITH CONSTRUCTING CRITICAL WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND ACCELERATE PROJECT COMPLETION. AUTHORIZATION FOR DESIGN BUILD AND CMG C. WILL HELP T. W. R. MEET THESE DEMANDS BY PROVIDING MORE FLEXIBLE AND EFFICIENT CONTRACTING OPTIONS THAT WILL ALLOW D. W. R. TO FOCUS ON ITS CORE COMPETENCIES THEY LIST OTHER EXPERTISE AS NEEDED FOR THINGS LIKE OFFICER EQUIPMENT BUILDINGS. RECREATION OR HABITAT PROJECTS QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED AS TO WHETHER THIS BILL WILL JUST PLACE STATE WORKERS BUT REALLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE D. W. R. IS CURRENTLY PURSUING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY EMPLOYEES ACROSS ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION TRADES AND CRAFTS THESE EMPLOYEES WILL BE PHASED IN OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. FOCUSED ON AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES. DECIDE BUILDING C. N. G. C. WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR GET IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF WORK THAT WOULD ALREADY BE CONTRACTED OUT. TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS JENNIFER APPEAR ON BEHALF OF THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS IN AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. IS JEANNIE COULD TELL ON BEHALF OF D. W. R. AND- JUST BEFORE. WE MOVE TO THAT AND THANK YOU SENATOR DODD I WAS INFORMED THAT REMOTE MEMBERS DON'T COUNT TOWARD THE QUORUM SO WE HAVE THE REQUISITE NUMBER FOR THE QUORUM HAS NOW ARRIVED SO WE'RE GOING TO RECALL THE QUORUM AND THEN REVOKED ON THE CONSENT AGENDA.

CODE IS ONE THREE EIGHT THREE SIX FIVE SEVEN. AND JENNIFER PIERRE FROM THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS IS THE LEAD SUPPORT AND WE HAVE JEAN COOK WELL FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WHO WILL NOT BE SPEAKING BUT BE ABLE TO OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO LET'S GO TO JENNIFER PIERRE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE ALL MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JENNIFER PIERRE AND I'M THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS MY ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS TWENTY SEVEN OF THE TWENTY NINE PUBLIC WATER ENTITIES THE WHOLE CONTRACTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES FOR THE DELIVERY OF STATE WATER PROJECT WATER. COLLECTIVELY MY MEMBERS PROVIDE A PORTION OF THE WATER SUPPLY DELIVERED APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF IRRIGATED LAND. THE STATE WATER PROJECT IS A COLLECTION OF SEVEN HUNDRED MILES OF CANALS PIPELINES. RESERVOIRS AND HYDROELECTRIC POWER FACILITIES THAT DELIVER WATER TO CUSTOMERS. THIS COMPLEX WATER GRID IS ACTUALLY THE LARGEST STATE OWNED AND OPERATED WATERED WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. AND DR CALIFORNIA'S QUALITY OF LIFE AND ECONOMIC VITALITY. ADAPTING AND UPDATING THE SIX YEAR OLD SYSTEM IS ESSENTIAL TO BUILDING A MORE RESILIENT WATER SUPPLY FOR THE FUTURE. ONE THAT CAN WITHSTAND A LONG LASTING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE DELIVERING THE PUBLIC BENEFIT OF CLEAN RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE WATER. THREE CHARGES FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE STATE WATER PROJECT MY MEMBERS HAVE FUNDED AND CONTINUE TO FUND. ALL CAPITAL PROJECTS OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT. AN EXTENSIVE ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION THAT'S REQUIRED AS PART OF OUR PERMITS. EFFICIENT AND TIMELY DELIVERY OF PROJECTS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING FACILITIES IS CRITICAL TO THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS AND ALL THE WATER USERS IT REPRESENTS. THIS IS WHY I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS STRONG SUPPORTER SB SIXTY SIX BY SENATOR DODD. PROJECTS USING DESIGN BUILDER THE CMG C. PROCUREMENT METHOD CAN BEGIN EARLIER AND AVOID DELAYS BECAUSE OF OVERLAPPING DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES. CAN HELP REDUCE PROJECT RISKS AND OVERALL COST OF WATER REPAIRS. AND WILL SUPPORT YOU TO BR AND EXPEDITING CRITICAL WATER INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADES. TO IMPROVE THE CLIMATE RESILIENCY OF CALIFORNIA'S WATER SUPPLY. EXAMPLE THE PROJECT THAT COULD UTILIZE THE TWO PROCUREMENT METHODS AUTHORIZED IN SB SIX TWO SIX INCLUDE. IMPROVEMENTS THE RIVER VALVE OUTLET THE OROVILLE DAM UPGRADE TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH AQUINOX. WATER NUYS INSECURITY DISABILITIES SUBSIDENCE REPAIRS AND UPGRADING TO POWER PLANTS. DID YOU ARE ALSO OUT OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DAM SAFETY PROJECTS UNDER WAY OR IN THE QUEUE. WHICH IS THIRTY MORE PROJECTS PLANNED THEN JUST FIVE YEARS AGO. THERE'S SEVERAL LARGE STATE WATER PROJECT PROJECTS WITH ESTIMATED COST OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE PLAN FOR THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS. IT'S CRITICAL THAT YOU HAVE YOUR HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO PURSUE CONTRACTING EFFICIENCIES TO COMPLETE THIS WORK. DESIGN BUILD IN C. M. D. C. WILL NOT DISPLACE THE WORK OF EXISTING STATE EMPLOYEES. BUT RATHER ALLOWS ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY WORK THAT WOULD ALREADY BE OUTSOURCED. AS THE B. C.

THREE EIGHT THREE SIX FIVE SEVEN. SO WITH THAT CENTER TAUGHT A WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THIRD MORNING- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. I'M HERE BECAUSE WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF A GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS THAT REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION. AND MY BILL SB FIVE FIVE NINE THE STATE WATER RESILIENCY ACT WILL HELP PREVENT A GLOBAL CATASTROPHE. LAST SESSION I INTRODUCED A BILL THE SAME NUMBER THAT REQUESTED FUNDING TO RESTRICT THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF THE FRAME KERN CANAL. THAT BILL WAS ULTIMATELY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR BUT STARTED A LARGER CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW AND WHERE. WE SHOULD BE SPENDING MONEY. WHEN WE HAVE IT TO REPAIR MUCH NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN BETTER PREPARE US FOR WATER NEEDS IN DROUGHT. AND NON DROUGHT YEARS. THIS CONVERSATION WAS CHAMPION ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL BY SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND CONGRESSMAN COST AS OFFICES. TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THIS CONVERSATION TODAY WITH THE FEDERAL ASK THAT MIRRORS THE ASK I BRING BEFORE YOU. TO FUND THE CANAL CONVEYANCE FOR REPAIRS ON THE CALIFORNIA AQUEDUCT THE DELTA MENDOTA CANAL ASSEMBLY WEST CANAL AND THE FRANKLIN CANAL. THE AGING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAKES OF THESE CANALS ARE NOW EXPERIENCE BETWEEN. A 15260% REDUCTION OF DESIGN FLOW CAPACITY. AT LEAST FIFTEEN TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR AND HIGHER OPERATIONAL EMPOWER COST. THIS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY THREATEN THE WATER SUPPLY FOR HUNDREDS OF CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING THOSE AND SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. IN FACT OVER THIRTY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS DEPEND ON THE WATER THAT FLOWS THROUGH THESE CANALS TO RUN THEIR HOMES. THE FARMS AND THE BUSINESSES. OVER THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS THE PROJECTS WILL CREATE TWELVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX JOBS DIRECTLY. AT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE AND DIRECTLY. IT WILL ALSO PRESERVE THOUSANDS MORE THAT COULD BE LOST IF LACK OF WATER LEADS TO FOLLOWED LANDS. TWO THIRDS OF THE NATION'S FRUITS AND VEGETABLES COME FROM CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA FEEDS THE WORLD A THREAT TO OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE FOOD AT THE VOLUME WE DO IS A THREAT NOT ONLY TO THE EXISTENCE OF OUR SMALL AND LARGE FARMS BUT TO THE PEOPLE THAT THE EMPLOYEE AND OUR ECONOMIC OUTPUT AS THE STATE. AND TO THE FOOD SECURITY OF THOSE THAT HAVE THE LEAST AMONG US. BUT REALLY EVERYONE. SB FIVE FIVE NINE PROVIDES IS THE OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY TO PLAN FOR FUTURE BUT PROTECTED AS WELL. THIS BILL REQUEST SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION TO FUND CANAL CONVEYANCE REPAIRS OVER THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS. IN THE PAST YEAR THE FRONT WATER AUTHORITY HAS ASSEMBLED MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. FROM LOCAL AGENCIES AND ALMOST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION AND FEDERAL FUNDING TO CONTRIBUTE TO REPAIRING THE FRANKEN CANAL. SB FIVE FIVE NINE CREATE THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE STATE TO TAKE ON ITS RIGHTFUL ROLE IN PARTNERING WITH LOCAL AGENCIES AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ON FIXING THE STATE'S WATER CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS. SYSTEMS THAT HELP DELIVER WATER TO CHIEF KEY STATE POLICIES AND GOALS FOR CLEAN DRINKING WATER. GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AND HABITATS SUPPORT. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE INVEST IN REPAIRING THESE CANALS TODAY CREATING NEEDED AND GOOD PAYING JOBS SECURING ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND TRAIN OUR CAPACITY TO REMAIN THE FOOD CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. I ALSO WANT TO THANK. MY GOOD COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND FOR BAKERSFIELD THAT'S ON THE DICE AT THE MOMENT AND MY GOOD FRIEND COLLEAGUE FROM- NORTH PER CALIFORNIA BEING CO AUTHORS OF THIS BILL AND FOR BEING SUPPORTIVE- REFERRING TO THE SENATOR FROM STOCKTON STOPPED MONTHS SORRY. ENOUGH I DON'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE TO TAKE THE CREDIT THE FOR SOMETHING SHE DID. I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT I HAVE JENNIFER PIERRE GENERAL MANAGER WITH THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS RICHARD OR TAKE A GENERAL MANAGER WITH THE GRASSLANDS WATER DISTRICT. GREAT THEN OF. AND THEY. WE SOCIALLY DISTANT STRIKE NOW- SO- LET'S BEGIN WITH RICHARD ORTEGA FROM THE GRASSLAND WATER DISTRICT AND THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM JENNIFER PIERRE FROM THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS RICARDO ORTEGA GENERAL MANAGER OF THE GRASS AND WATER DISTRICT AND GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY I ALSO SERVE AS A BOARD MEMBER ON THE SAN LUIS DELTA MENDOTA WATER AUTHORITY. COMPRISED OF TWENTY SEVEN AGRICULTURAL MUNICIPAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL WATER AGENCIES THAT OPERATE THE DELTA MENDOTA CANAL I'M PLEASED TO TESTIFY TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE FIVE NINE. THE FEDERAL DELTA MENDOTA. IN FRONT KERN CANALS HAVE LOST SIGNIFICANT FLOW CAPACITY OVER THE YEARS TO LAND SUBSIDENCE. WHICH IS IMPACTED THE ABILITY TO RELIABLY DELIVER WATER TO MANY SAN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY COMMUNITIES FARMS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THESE CAN THESE CANALS CONVEY WATER TO MILLIONS OF ACRES OF FARMLAND AND THE LAST REMAINING 5% OF WETLANDS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THESE WEAPONS RECHARGE AQUIFERS AND SUPPORT MILLIONS OF MIGRATORY BIRDS AND OTHER WILDLIFE EACH YEAR. THE GAS AND WATER DISTRICT CONVEYS WATER TO WILDLIFE REFUGES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED AS- ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS REMAINING IN THE AMERICAS. WETLANDS AND WILDLIFE REQUIRE ADEQUATE SUPPLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ON A SCHEDULE MOST BENEFICIAL TO THEM. TO TOP THE SUBSIDENCE ALONG THESE CANALS THREATENS THEIR ABILITY TO HABITAT AND TO KEEP WILDLIFE POPULATIONS HEALTHY. RESTORING CANNELLA CAPACITY IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN BUILDING RESILIENCY IN A CHANGING CLIMATE. DROUGHTS ARE NOW MORE FREQUENT LONGER LASTING AND MORE SEVERE STORMS ARE WARMER PRODUCE LESS NO AND MORE FLOODING. CALIFORNIANS THE WATER FACILITIES I CAN RECAPTURE FLOODWATER AND EFFICIENTLY DELIVERED TO LANDS THAT CAN RECHARGE THE AQUIFER. CALIFORNIA'S WATER SYSTEM IS INTERCONNECTED AND WAS BUILT BY A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LOCALS THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS. SB FIVE FIVE NINE BILLS ON THAT PARTNERSHIP BY PROVIDING THE STATE MATCH TO A LOCAL COMMITMENT. TO RESTORE THE BACKBONE INFRASTRUCTURE THE CALIFORNIANS AND THE ENVIRONMENT DEPEND ON. WHILE ALSO CREATING SUSTAIN AND SUSTAINING THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FOR TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM- JENNIFER PIERRE FROM THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS. THE MORNING AGAIN AS I THINK YOU KNOW MY NAME IS JENNIFER PIERRE THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS AND THE GENERAL MANAGER AND WE REPRESENT TWENTY SEVEN OF THE TWENTY NINE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THAT CONTRACT WITH THE W. R. FOUR SIX- THE FEDERAL STATE ON CANALS IDENTIFIED IN SB FIVE FIVE NINE ARE CRITICAL TO SUPPORT CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE BY FACILITATING THE MOVEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF WATER WHEN IT'S WET TO STORAGE NEEDS DURING DROUGHTS THESE CANALS PROVIDE DRINKING WATER TO OVER THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE BAY AREA AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. INCLUDING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS WELL THE IRRIGATION WATER OVER THREE MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND BUT SUBSIDENCE HAS DRASTICALLY REDUCED SUPPLY RELIABILITY AND INCREASED ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE WATER PROJECT IS ALREADY EXPERIENCING A 33% REDUCTION OF DESIGN FLOW CAPACITY AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND HIGHER OPERATIONAL AND ENERGY COSTS. SUBSIDENCE DUE TO GROUNDWATER PUMPING HAS BEEN OCCURRING IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FOR NEARLY A CENTURY. THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT AFTER TWENTY FOURTEEN WILL HELP PROTECT INFRASTRUCTURE FROM FUTURE SUBSIDENCE. HOWEVER THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGE IMPACTS TWO THIRDS OF THE ENTIRE STATE. INCLUDING MILLIONS OF WATER USERS WHO DID NOT CAUSE THE DAMAGE. IDENTIFYING ALL THE PARTIES WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IN SECURING THEIR FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS IS A COMPLEX. AND LENGTHY UNDERTAKING NEVERTHELESS WHERE POSSIBLE IT REMAINS AN OPTION FOR ASSEMBLY LOCAL FUNDING PACKAGES. OF THE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES PAY FOR THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS OF THESE CANAL SYSTEMS. THEIR BUDGETS ARE FUNDED BY THE PEOPLE FARMS AND BUSINESSES THAT USE THE WATER INCLUDING WATER USERS WHO ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAMAGE. THE REPAIR COSTS ARE SIMPLY TOO GREAT FOR THEM TO BEAR ALONE- GATHER A FEDERAL FUNDING FROM TWO COMPANION BILLS INTRODUCED BY US SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN. AND CONGRESSMAN JIM COSTA AND A LOCAL CULTURE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CURRENT STATE BUDGET SURPLUS AND POTENTIALLY A CLIMATE RESILIENCY BOND TO HELP FUND REPAIRS TO FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA.

JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CLARIFY THAT QUESTION COULD ONE OF YOU TO GUESS TO BE THE EXPERT WITNESS- YES THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST. STATE ALTHOUGH THE- NO I THINK THERE'S A AND A CONSULTANT SHAKING HIS HEAD SO I THINK THE ISSUE IS. IT IN PRACTICE YOU EXPECTED TO BE CONTINGENT I WAS JUST ASKED IF IT WAS ACTUALLY CONTINGENT WRITTEN IN THE BILL. DO YOU KNOW IF IT'S WRITTEN IN THE BUILD THAT THIS. IS I THINK PEOPLE ARE SHAKING THEIR HEADS. HI OKAY I DO NOT KNOW. HOME WELL MESSAGES EVEN THOUGH SOME HAVE OF ANSWERED THAT WOULD JUST BE A GOOD THING TO. FOR THE AUTHOR TO DEFINITIVELY ANSWER SOMETIME. AFTER THIS HEARING. AND THEN MY COMMENT WAS GOING TO BE- FROM THIS WILL BE A CONFUSING COMMENT BUT FIRST PART ISN'T CONFUSING AT ALL ARE YOU DOING A GREAT JOB OF REPRESENTING YOUR DISTRICT AND YOUR REGION AND CONGRATULATIONS FOR THAT THEY WERE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU AS AN ADVOCATE. HARM IN UNFORTUNATELY I KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS AT THE END SO. OF THE BIG CONCERN I HAVE A FEW OF THEM. IS THAT WE HAVE A HISTORIC BENEFICIARY PAYS A POLICY IN CALIFORNIA- WATER PROJECT ITSELF WAS 97% PAID FOR BY THE WATER USERS AND EVEN TOUGH THERE WAS A SLIGHT AMENDMENT TO THAT IN THE- IN THE WATER BOND IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHERE THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE WHAT FOR LAND. AND THIS IS A LOGICAL THING FOR THE USERS TO PAY BECAUSE AS WAS SAID THIRTY ONE MILLION- BUT PEOPLE ARE SERVED WATER FROM THIS AND THREE MILLION. ACRES OF IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE THAT COULD BE SPREAD OUT AND AT A RELATIVELY LOW COST TO ALL OF THEM OVER TIME AND CONTINUE THE BENEFICIARY PAYS. AND I THINK THE MARYLAND ISSUED DIVORCE DEFEATED IN PART BECAUSE- THERE WAS A BENEFICIARY PAYS. SORT OF CHANGE THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THAT. AND THE- THERE'S ALSO STATE MONEY GOING FOR FEDERAL PROJECT WHICH I THINK IS IT IS OF CONCERN. AND THIS BENEFITS A SPECIFIC AREA SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE BUT NOT EVERYBODY ALL THE TAXPAYERS WILL DO IT AND THE STATISTIC WAS CITED. OF THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT CAME FROM CALIFORNIA MORE VERY LARGE AMOUNT COME FROM MY DISTRICT TO THE GENERAL REGION WHETHER IT'S PART OF OUR THE SALINAS VALLEY BUT THEY DO NOT IMPORT WATER AND THEY WILL NOT GET A DIME FROM THIS BILL SO IN MANY WAYS. IT FAVORS ONE AGRICULTURAL AREA OVER ANOTHER AND THE REASON WE HAD A WATER BOND WAS TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY GOT A FAIR SHARE NOT JUST A SELECT A PART OF THE STATE OR FOR SELECT. WATER USERS SAID. ARE USED TO HAVE THIS RIFF WHAT I SAID WHEN I WAS IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM MONTEREY AND SANTA CRUZ I SAID WE'D HAVE TO CUT OUR SCHOOLS AND CUT OUR HEALTH CARE AND PAY A 100% FOR OUR WATER AND THEN USE TAX DOLLARS TO PAY FOR SOMEBODY ELSE'S WELL. THEN FOR EIGHT YEARS AS RESOURCES SECRETARY I SUPPORTED THAT AND NOW I AM BACK. TO ADVOCATING FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT WANTED TO GET. A FAIR SHARE OR SO UP FROM THAT IS OF CONCERN AND I KNOW THAT I GOT A PUSH BACK IN THE- SOME OF THE LOBBYING VISITS BY THIS WILL BENEFIT THE STATE'S ECONOMY BECAUSE OF SILICON VALLEY AND THE AG SECTOR. BUT IF YOU'RE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY THAT IS NOT SERVED BY STATE OR FEDERAL WATER YOU WERE EVEN MORE DISADVANTAGE FOR PAYING TAXES AND NOT GETTING ANYTHING BACK AND SO. I BASICALLY WANT TO GIVE THE AUTHOR CHANGED HER TO WORK ON THIS AND SEE IF MAYBE THERE'S AN AMENDMENT ABOUT CONTINGENCY AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN IT FOR OTHER PEOPLE IN THE STATE I'M GOING TO VOTE TO MOVE THIS ALONG BUT I HAVE THOSE CONCERNS AND I REALLY WANTED TO. WIPE. THEM OUT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY WAY. ARE THE TO TAKE BE. SO I JUST OBLIGATED TO ME THAT STATEMENT. OTHER COM- SENATORS ON STORAGE ANDERSON HAS UP HE HAD IS BUT DID HIM UP I HAVE TO ACTUAL EMERGENCY SO MISTER CHAIR I'M GONNA GO TO THE DIGITAL HAND AND THEN I'M GOING TO GO TO THE TWO HANDS IN THE ROOM SO SENATOR START. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I MEAN I'M WILLING TO DEFER TO THE DIS OVER DIGITAL IF- IF THE MEMBERS NEED TO LEAVE SO I'LL BE HERE FOR THE HEARING DO YOU WANT TO CHECK. I HAVEN'T SPEAK EVERYBODY'S OKAY KEEP GOING OKAY GREAT- I WOULD ECHO EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID AND ESPECIALLY THE NOTE ABOUT. CENTER TIED TO YOUR RELENTLESS ADVOCACY FOR THE COMMUNITIES YOU REPRESENT- AND NOT JUST YOU KNOW THE BUSINESS SIDE OF THINGS BUT FOR REAL PEOPLE EVERYWHERE TO STE SO I. DON'T I REALLY RESPECT YOU BRING IN THIS MEASURE BACK- I SHARE SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS ABOUT JUST THE OVERALL FRAMEWORK HERE- IN VENTURA COUNTY AND YOU KNOW THE UNINCORPORATED PARTS L. A. N. THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT IT WORRYING YOU KNOW THAT DROUGHTS NOT HITTING AS HARD IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW BUT- THE- WHAT MY HOPE IS IF YOU GET THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO DAVID. YOU'LL JUST YOU'LL CONSIDER BEFORE. THE FLOOR- YOU KNOW LOOKING AT ARRANGEMENTS THAT THAT. THE PORTIONS SAVE THE BENEFICIARY QUESTION OR EVEN A SUBSIDY AND THE SUBSIDENCE RESPONSIBILITY QUESTION A LITTLE MORE AND I WAS REALLY HEARTENED BY THE WAY TO HEAR FROM IS PIERRE- THE POTENTIAL FEASIBILITY OF SOME OF THAT ANALYSIS BEFORE WE- CUT THE FINAL DEAL AND PUT THE SENATE'S FINAL DROUGHT PACKAGE TOGETHER AND I WOULD SAY I'M I'M OPEN TO. TO SUPPORTING THIS BILL AT IT AT A FUTURE DATE- IF ESPECIALLY WE CAN GET  LITTLE MORE THAT DATA BACK AND REALLY UNDERSTAND- WHAT SUBSIDENCE CAUSATION YOU KNOW HOW HOW GRANULAR WE CAN GET IN THAT- CAUSATION ISSUE- AND ALSO TO RE LOOK AT THE APPORTIONMENT OF STATE FUNDING FOR STATE PROJECTS VERSUS FEDERAL PROJECTS AND HOPEFULLY. FIND IT A LITTLE MORE SURGICAL WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT I RESPECTED THERE'S A THIRD THIRD THIRD SORT OF FRAMEWORK GET THE FEDERAL LEVEL TOO SO THAT FEELS CLEAN BUT I'D I'D LOVE TO GET IT A LITTLE MORE TAILORED TO THE SPECIFIC COSTS NEEDS AND CAPACITY LOSS TO SUBSIDENCE OVERLAID WITH THAT BENEFICIARY PAYS PRINCIPLE- SO JUST FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. AND SENATOR STERN- MISS PIER MOVED TO THE MICROPHONES IF SHE'S GOING TO. WHO WHO IS IN THAT IT IS ANY OF THAT IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION. IF THAT BE ALRIGHT MISS PIER I WAS CURIOUS WITH THE FEASIBILITY OF DOING SOME OF THAT ANALYSIS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT- THAT SOUNDED LIKE A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE SIT STEP FRANKLY TO DEFINING AND YOU KNOW REALLY DURABLE FRAMEWORK HERE GOING FORWARD SO JUST TAKE ANY COMMENTS ON JUST SETTING EXPECTATIONS OF THE ABILITY TO ASSESS- SOME OF THAT SUBSIDENCE CAPACITY. ISSUE YES I THINK YOU HIS PEER THANK YOU- I WAS GONNA JUST RESPOND THAT I THINK EVERY YEAR THE DATA GETS BETTER AND BETTER ABOUT WHERE THE SUBSIDENCE REALLY IS HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF IT IS AND THEN WHERE IT'S COMING FROM. WE DON'T HAVE THAT TODAY AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE- AS BILL AS YOU YOU TODAY IS THE- THIS IS A CLIMB EMERGE. INTO LAW OF WAYS THE ABILITY TO REALLY BE RESILIENT ABOUT HOW WE MOVE WATER AROUND THE STATE. SO WHILE ARE VERY OPEN TO CONTINUING TO. COLLECT THE DATA ANALYZE THE DATA. AND TALK ABOUT RESPONSIBLE PARTIES VERSES BENEFICIARIES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT OVERLAP. ENTIRELY THIS IS REALLY CRITICAL AS WE SEE IT TO THE WHOLE STATE SO I THINK THE COMMITMENT IS REALLY TO KEEP. DEVELOPING THAT INFORMATION BUT I YOU KNOW I DEFINITELY COULD NOT. COMMIT TO HAVING THAT INFORMATION WITHIN THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MR STERN'S ON MUTE SO I THINK THAT COMPLETES HIS SENATOR HUESO AND THEN CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AND I'M GONNA ON ONE ALSO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS AND BE PHYSICALLY INHERITED A BIG MESS. AND THE SOLUTION IS VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY COSTLY. WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR TEN YEARS DISCUSSING THIS RESTORATION AND WHAT IS A STATE DONE A RESPONSE TO A TILT TODAY REALLY NOTHING ON THE A SHAME- THIS IS A- IMPORTANT- PIECE OF. OF A RESOURCE THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY OF OUR STATE HEALTH FOR STATE. AND A VERY IMPORTANT DELIVERING DRINKING WATER TO A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR STATE'S POPULATIONS VERY SAD. THAT WE'RE NOWHERE CLOSER TO FIXING THIS PROBLEM THEN. SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE DISCUSSING THIS FOR TEN YEARS WERE STILL DISCUSSING HERE. SO YOU KNOW I. I'M LOOKING AT THE BILL AND I SEE A REASONABLE PROPOSAL OF. LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING THAT THAT IS A HUGE IMPROVEMENT FROM THE LAST BILL WHICH I ALSO SUPPORT BECAUSE I WANT TO SUPPORTER A FIX FOR THIS. BUT THERE IS ALSO- THERE THERE'S LOTS OF CONSIDERATIONS AND ONE ONE OF THE POSITIONS OF THIS ANALYSIS TAKES AS WELL WHOEVER OWNS AND OPERATES IT NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. AND IT KIND OF ALLUDES TO THE FACT THAT WE'RE HERE BECAUSE THEY DID SOMETHING WRONG. AND REALLY THIS IS THE RESULT OF YEARS AND YEARS OF NEGLECT OF OUR WATER TABLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS CAUSED NOT ONLY SUBSIDENCE BUT THE REVERSAL OF THE FLOW. OF A LOT OF THESE RIVERS THAT ARE NOW THREATENING SPECIES JUST BECAUSE ARE NOT FLOWING PROPERLY AND- AND ALSO IS CAUSING SALT WATER INTRUSION IN CERTAIN PLACES OF THE COAST ARE ARE THREATENING. OUR ABILITY TO GROW FOOD IN IN THOSE AREAS THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM. AND WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP THIS FLOW HEALTHY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. HANSEL THIS LIST NOT ONLY THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE AREA FRESNO COUNTY BY SALIA AREA OF OUR CENTRAL VALLEY THIS IS REALLY ABOUT THE WHOLE ECO SYSTEM. OF OUR ENTIRE CALIFORNIA ESTUARY WHICH. EXTENDS FROM LOS AND ALL THE WAY TO MY SHASTA AND THE A MASSIVE. ESTUARY OF- THAT'S OF. IT'S HARD FOR ANOTHER ONE AND WE'RE- THAT IS AS IMPORTANT A CAN AND IN THE OF FOOD AND AS AS AS LONG AND FOR AS A ONE IS. SO WE HAVE TO FIND THE RESOURCE TO MAKE WORK AND YOU KNOW JUST WANTED. THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ONE OF THE OF THIS I THINK THIS MISSING FROM THIS BILL THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDED. TO SOME LEVEL OF MAKING THIS A STATE PRIORITY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND USING THIS BILL TO CALL ON THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL CONGRESSIONAL. OF THE BODIES- OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS TO REALLY- ACT ON. FUNDING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF THIS. AND I THINK WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE SELECTING DATA YOU'RE LOOKING AT DATA ONE THING IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW. THAT CALIFORNIA HAS STARTED TO MANAGER GROUNDWATER IT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS FOR US TO MAKE IT HEALTHY BUT WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THAT PROCESS WHICH HAD BEEN NEGLECTED FOR. BASICALLY THE ENTIRE. BOB THE EXISTENCE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SINCE EIGHTEEN FIFTY. WE'VE BEEN DIPPING INTO THAT AQUIFER FOR SO LONG THAT IT TO THE SUBSIDENCE IS NOT CREATE CREATE DAMAGE BUT NOW WE'RE MANAGING THAT. WERE ACTUALLY PAYING FARMERS TO FLOOD THEIR FIELDS. SO THAT THE WATER COULD. SEEP INTO THE AQUIFER AND BATTLE. THE ONGOING SUBSIDENCE IS CURRENTLY THREATENING THE VALLEY AND I THINK THAT'S ONE POLICY THAT'S VERY HELPFUL TOWARD THIS END. IF WE CAN. ARREST SUBSIDENCE ANY FURTHER. WE CAN START TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN THE SYSTEM AND- THAT IT'LL BE WANT ONE TIME AND INVESTMENT AND THAT THIS WILL NOT CONTINUE FURTHER SO I THINK A COMBINATION WITH WHAT WE'VE DONE. WE HAVE A LOT OF A VERY STRONG A VERY SOLID GROUND TO STAND ON TO REQUEST MORE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO ADD THAT TO THE BILL OR AT LEAST A- INTRODUCED A RESOLUTION- OF A RESOLUTION TO- ASKING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO- THAT. FUND THIS ISSUE I THINK TRILLIONS ARE BEING RAISED IT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS WORKING ON AN ECONOMIC PACKAGE THAT WILL BRING MONEY TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT SHOULD BE HIGH ON THE LIST AND- AND WE SHOULD- ADD THIS PROJECT TO THE LIST OF ELIGIBLE PROJECTS FOR THAT FUNDING SHOULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACT TO DO THAT AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE BILL. SO THAT THEY COULD FIND A MAJOR PORTION OF THIS BAND AND GIVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THE BILL SHOULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BRING SOME OF THIS MONEY THERE SHOULD BE SOME ADJUSTMENT TO ALLOW THAT. MONEY TO COME IN AND SAVE THE STATE'S OF MONEY BECAUSE WE- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ASSISTANCE AND WE NEED TO ADD SOME OF THAT MONEY COME BACK TO THE STATE SO. ONE ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. AND I THINK THIS WILL THIS BILL REALLY NEEDS TO STAY ALIVE AND MOVED FORWARD AND- AND USE THAT AS A- AS A MEANS OF COMMUNICATING WITH OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SAY PLEASE- GET INVOLVED BECAUSE THIS IS IMPORTANT PROJECT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SENATOR GROWTH. AT THANK YOU MATT MISTER CHAIR. I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST MADE AND- I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL AND ALLOWING ME TO CO AUTHOR IT. YOUR PREDECESSOR WHO WORKED ON THIS BILL- IN IT WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO IS CORRECT THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE FOR OVER A DECADE- HE SAID TEN YEARS BUT I BELIEVE IT'S OVER A DECADE- AND IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING. THAT WE STILL CAN'T PROVIDE WATER TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I UNDERSTAND THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS ABOUT- NEARLY ENTIRE STATE PAYING FOR THIS BUT I DISAGREE WITH THE TEACHER'S COMMENTS ABOUT- ONLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY BENEFITS FROM THIS. THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS THE TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE WORLD NOT IN THE NATION NONE OF THE STATE IN THE WORLD. AND THESE AND WHEN YOU SAID THAT WE ARE AND- YOU IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS THAT WE COULD BE ON THE VERGE OF A FOOD CRISIS. WE VERY WELL COULD BE ON THE VERGE OF A FOOD CRISIS THAT IS NOT DRAMATIC- THERE ARE NONE SEVERAL COMMODITIES- BASED ON AND CALIFORNIA'S- THE FOOD AND DRUG OR THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION THAT. HAS BEEN PUT OUT THAT SEVERAL COMMODITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE PRODUCE 99% OF THEM IN THE WORLD. THAT MEANS THAT- IF THESE COMMODITIES GO AWAY. AT THOSE IT'LL BE VERY HARD TO GET THOSE THINGS AND I BELIEVE- ALL OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS- AS EAT AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER PISTACHIOS CUTIES KIWIS. CARROTS THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FOOD THAT IS PRODUCED THAT ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE NATION THE WORLD BENEFIT FROM. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST A BENEFIT TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ALSO GIVEN MY COLLEAGUE ABOUT THIS TAKING SO LONG AND- IT TRULY IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE A LIKE I SAID- CENTER VIDAK: HAD WORKED IN THIS ISSUE. SENATOR HER DAUGHTER WAS CHAMPION THIS ISSUE- NOW. AS PRESIDENT TRUMP AUTHORIZED- DOLLARS TO BE SPENT ON THIS TWO HUNDRED SIX MILLION IS ALREADY BEEN ATTRIBUTED. PRESIDENT BIDEN DIANNE FEINSTEIN JIM COSTA KEVIN MCCARTHY THIS TRULY IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE AND IT'S AMAZING TO ME WITH ALL THESE POWERFUL PEOPLE THAT. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TO BE ABLE TO FIX THE SITUATION THAT WE CAN'T EVER SEEM TO GET IT DONE. M. SO THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING GOING ON THAT WE ARE NOT AWARE AT. THIS BILL- APPROPRIATES- THERE'S ABOUT THERE'S MONEY THAT NOT JUST A FRANK CURRENT CANAL CORRECT THERE IS FOR CANALS THAT ARE BEING FIXED WITH THIS. INCLUDING THE DELTA MENDOTA- SUBSIDENCE ISSUE IN THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE THERE AND THEN ALSO. WITH THE CALIFORNIA AQUIDNECK- THERE IS A THE SIZE ISSUE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DELIVER WATER- IS THE MECHANISM IS THERE IT JUST HAS BEEN NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IN YOUR BILL SOLVES THAT. IN YOUR BILL SOLVES A VERY STRATEGICALLY FROM ONE THIRD- FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE THIRD OF THE RESOURCES COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ONE THIRD FROM THE END USERS. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THE END USERS ARE TAKING A HUGE RISK AGAIN AND YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT. THE END USERS PAID FOR- AGREED TO THE WATER BOND THEY PAID FOR AND THEY'RE PAYING FOR MORE WATER NOW. AND THEN IS BEING DELIVERED. IT'S LIKE GOING TO A GROCERY STORE IN PUTTING A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE GROCERIES ON THE BELT. AND WALKING OUT OF THE STORE OF TO PAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS WITH TEN DOLLARS WORTH OF A PRODUCT. AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR END USERS THEY'RE PAYING FOR WATER THAT THEY NO LONGER GET. AND SO THEY ARE TAKING A RISK TO BE ABLE TO PUT UP THIS THIRD. BUT I'M GLAD THAT THEY'RE DOING IT AND THEY STILL HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM. AND I THINK THAT TAKES SOMEONE LIKE YOU TO BRING ALL THOSE PARTIES TOGETHER. AM I KNOW YOU HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. PRIOR ADMINISTRATION I AGREE RELATIONSHIPS. OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU BROUGHT THEM HE- YOU DO THAT NOW I HAVE TOLD. CONFIDENCE IN YOU TO DO THAT. AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE- I REALLY DO BELIEVE. THAT THIS COULD BE THE TO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY. GE THE SIX. FIX AND- THAT AND- I. EVERY AT THE TABLE AND I THINK THAT EVERYBODY IN THE STATE THE NATION EVEN THE WORLD BENEFIT FROM S. FIXING THIS PROBLEM. AGAIN I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE. AND LET THAT SINK IN A LITTLE BIT THE TOP THREE FOOD. PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE ENTIRE WORLD- ARE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND DEBT WATER THAT IS NOT JUST A SLOGAN THAT FOOD GROWS WHERE WATER FLOWS AND WE NEED WATER TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE THAT FOOD. THAT ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS EAT. SO I THINK YOU FOR- CHAMPION THIS I THINK YOU- FOR WILLING TO BE WILLING TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE NOT ONLY HERE BUT IN THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU WERE RIGHT THERE WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE. DOING EVERYTHING HE COULD TO BRING WATER TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO THANK YOU MISTER TITLE FOR THAT AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'LL I WANT TO. I WOULD SAY THAT BY I WOULD I WAS ONE OF THE- WHO WORKED ON THAT TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN WATER BOND AND YOU KNOW WE HAD HIGH HOPES THAT WAS GONNA. YEAH TO PERHAPS MORE THAN IT DID. BUT ONE OF THE TENANTS WE MADE A NOTE THAT WAS ALL AREAS OF THE STATE BE TREATED. EQUALLY OUR WATER. THINGS GO WATER FLOWS IN IN INFLOWS. IT COULD IT DOESN'T ALWAYS ORIGINATE WHERE IT THE END USES WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND I'LL BE I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BUT I'D LIKE TO STATE FOR THE RECORD I AM NOT A CO AUTHOR I THINK IT IS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS WHO IS A CO AUTHOR ON THE SYSTEM. THANK THANK YOU. AND THEN JUST BEFORE. FOLLOWING INTO CLOSE. I WOULD ADD ONE INTERESTING THING BECAUSE IT WAS SAID NOT MUCH HAS BEEN DONE THAT WATER BOND- THE PARK ROAD ALLY PRIME AGRICULTURAL AREA. MONEY WENT FOR WATER RECYCLING END IN THE YEAR BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WHERE THEY HAVE SEA WATER INTRUSION THAT CENTER HUESO WAS TALKING ABOUT. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MODERN TIMES THERE WAS NO SEWAGE THAT CAME OUT OF THE OUT FALL INTO THE MONTEREY BAY BECAUSE THEY WERE RECYCLING AT A HUNDRED PERCENT. A. N. USE AGAIN AGAINST THE SEA WATER INTRUSION AND PRIMARY GARIA SO ALL THESE THINGS TO FIT TOGETHER IN A- DIFFERENT POINT. CENTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR COMMENTS FOR YOUR CONCERNS FOR YOUR SUPPORT- HI. THIS BILL AND IN GENERAL THAT THE DISHES OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY THIS IS NOT ABOUT. A RED AMERICA BLUE AMERICA. BUT TALKING ABOUT AMERICANS REAL PEOPLE THAT ARE. SIGNIFICANTLY AND HAPPEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY. THIS LACK OF WATER- IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I SAW FIRST HAND D. D. AND A NON DROUGHT YEAR THE DAMAGE THAT IT DOES TO REAL PEOPLE NOT HAVING WATER- AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF THAT. I EVEN NOW- AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT INVESTMENT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS AN INVESTMENT IN ALL CALIFORNIA BUT- I BELIEVE THAT IT STRETCHES FAR FAR BEYOND THAT. CALIFORNIA HAS THE ABILITY TO HELP PREVENT A GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS IT'S VERY REAL IT'S THIS IS NOT A JOKE- IT'S NOT TRYING TO. EXAGGERATE EITHER- AND YET FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU TO. DO WE HAVE A MOTION FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE MOTION BY SENATOR HUESO AND BEFORE I ASKED WITH THE ROLE BE COLD. WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY REMOTELY BY SENATOR LEóN SO SENATOR WE MOAN LET ME ASK YOU WHERE YOU ARE AND WHO'S WITH YOU. THANK YOU CENTER EARLY MON IN SANTA BARBARA DISTRICT OFFICE AND I HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT IS WITH ME IN THE OFFICE. PERFECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM FIVE SB FIVE NINE NINE FIVE FIVE NINE THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. LAYERED HI THERE TO ALL RIGHT JONES. JONES ALL RIGHT ALLEN. EGGMAN EGGMAN. GROVE GROVE HI HERTZBERG. HUESO I'VE HUESO ALL RIGHT LIMóN. REALLY MULLIN SB FIVE FIVE NINE NOT LOADING. STERN. SENATOR STERN SB FIVE FIVE NINE ABSTAINING. OKAY A WILL FIVE YES VOTES AND WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL FOR THE OTHER TWO ON THE CAR THANK YOU SENATOR. FOR WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO- ITEM NUMBER SEVEN. S. B. TWENTY SEVEN CENTER SKINNER SENATOR SKINNER IS SOON AS THE- PODIUM'S COINS HERE WELCOME 2% WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- SB TWENTY SEVEN. IS ANOTHER WE USE THESE TERMS ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOL KIT BASICALLY WE TO REALLY AVERT THE WORST ASPECTS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO MORE THAN JUST EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS- OUR- NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS WETLANDS FORESTS HEALTHY SOILS THE OCEAN SO MUCH MORE. HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CAPTURE CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE THAT'S PART OF THEIR LIVING CYCLE. THOSE SOLUTIONS JUST DEAD IN THEIR NATURAL PROCESSES ARE LOWER COST THAN MANY OF OUR EMISSIONS REDUCTION ACTIVITIES. AND WE HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW WHERE THERE ARE MANY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR MANY COMPANIES THAT WANT TO FUNNEL THEIR MONEY INTO SUPPORTING PROJECTS THEY ARE IN WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE VOLUNTARY MARKET. AND THEY HAVE BEEN SIGNING PLEDGES TO GO CARBON NEUTRAL BY TWENTY FORTY AHEAD OF THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD COMPANIES LIKE UNILEVER MICROSOFT IBM COCA COLA COOPER. SO WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS FOR US TO CREATE A VOLUNTARY REGISTRY OF SUCH PROJECTS SO THAT. IN THE END I WANT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC HERE THESE THIS WOULD NOT BE PROJECTS THAT COULD BE USED TO MEET YOUR EIGHT COMPANIES OR AN ENTITY STATUTORILY REQUIRED EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS NOW WE KNOW THAT IN THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THERE ARE DO YOU THERE IS THE ABILITY FOR COMPANIES TO USE OFFSETS BUT THAT'S A VERY FORMALIZED PRACTICE THIS BILL DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THAT PRACTICE. THIS BILL IN EFFECT WILL HELP US PREVENT GREENWASHING CAN HELP US DIRECT THIS PRIVATE SECTOR MONEY INTO CALIFORNIA BY CREATING A REGISTRY THAT. VERIFIES PROD YOU CAN BE ON THE BALLOT MARKET THAT WE KNOW ARE REAL AND ACTUALLY ACT CAPTURING CARBON ADDITIONALLY MORE IMPORTANTLY IT DIRECTS IN ORDER TO DO THAT IT DIRECTS OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND A. R. B. TO SET GOALS FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION FROM NATURAL WORKING LANDS AND THEN ESTABLISHING THIS VOLUNTARY REGISTRY OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION PROJECTS AT OPR AND NOTICED I TOOK IT OUT OF THE REGULATORY ENTITY BECAUSE IT IS NOT TO BE USED TO MEET OUR STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS- BUT IT DOES REQUIRES. A RB TO TRACK PROJECTS AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE COHEN CEO OF THE CLIMATE PLAN MIGHT MY TWO KEY WITNESSES ARE ELLIE COHEN CEO OF THE CLIMATE PLAN AND READ OUT IS FROM THE CALIFORNIA HABITAT CONSERVATION PLANNING COALITION. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH COM. AS MENTIONED WE HAVE L. A. CONE FIRST AND READ OUT A SECOND THEY'RE BOTH ON THE CONFERENCE LINE A MISSED CALL ON WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING SURE LAYERED AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH MY NAME IS ELLIE COHEN CEO OF THE CLIMATE CENTER I AM HONORED TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB TWENTY SEVEN. WHICH WILL SET URGENTLY NEEDED THEY CALL FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION ALL NATURAL WORKING LANDS. AND HELP CATALYZE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT. THE CRIME INSTEAD OF THE POLICY NONPROFIT WORKING FOR RAPID GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS AT SCALE YOU'RE A CLIMATE SAFE CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN WHICH AIMS TO ACCELERATE STATE CLIMATE POLICY TIME LINE'S. ENERGY NET NEGATIVE EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY. YOU AND SCIENTIFICO. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT TO PREVENT DANGEROUS IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE TO CUT EMISSIONS IN HALF BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND REMOVE EMISSIONS ALREADY PUT IN THE ATMOSPHERE FROM HUMAN ACTIVITY. NEW STUDIES SINCE THEN SHOW WILL PASS THE ONE POINT FIVE CELSIUS THRESHOLD OF DANGEROUS FORMING WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE MUCH EARLIER THAN EXPECTED. REQUIRING XCELERATED EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AS WELL AS XCELERATED INVESTMENTS IN NATURAL SEQUESTRATION. A GROWING NUMBER OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES SHOW THAT NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS CAN SEQUESTER SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF ADDITIONAL CARBON WITH ADDED BENEFITS OF HELPING OUR STATE THE MORE RESILIENT TO EVER WORSENING DROUGHT WILDFIRE AND SHE LEVEL RISE. WHILE INCREASING GROUNDWATER SUPPLIES WATER IN AIR QUALITY BIODIVERSITY AND FOOD SECURITY THEY'RE ALSO NEW TECHNOLOGIES EMERGING FOR DIRECTLY CAPTURING CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. WE SUPPORT SALL SCALE TESTING OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES ONLY IF THEY DO NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT I DO NOT REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS EFFORTS. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE STATE PARTNERING WITH PRIVATE ENTITIES TO SCALE UP INVESTMENTS CALIFORNIA BASED CARBON SEQUESTRATION ON NATURAL WORKING LANDS. ENSURING THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE AS ACCESSIBLE TO AS MANY PRODUCERS OF POSSIBLE AND ARE NOT. USED AS AN ADMISSIONS OFFICER. WITH RAPIDLY WERE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS THE CALIFORNIA IN THE EARLY STAGES OF A SEVERE MULTI DECADE DROUGHT THE CLIMATE CENTER THANK SENATOR SKINNER FOR HER CLIMATE LEADERSHIP AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OF SB TWENTY SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PADDOCK'S WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING SHERRY MEMBERS READ OUT ASSEMBLY HAPPEN TO CALIFORNIA AVOCAT CONSERVATION PLANNING COALITION.

HOWEVER THESE NATURAL LANDS CAN BE A SOLUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUPPORTING SB TWENTY SEVEN TODAY WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POLICY BUILDING HELP STRIDES STATE AND ITS STATE POLICIES TO SEE THAT NATURAL LANDS ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION.

SURE WE DO HAVE ONE PERSON THAT WAS COMING FROM LINE EIGHTY SEVEN. THANK YOU. PORTABLE CHAIR STEAMERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KERRY HUGHES AND I WORK AS THE CALIFORNIA POLICY MONITORED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION BIO FUEL WATCH. OUR ORGANIZATION OPPOSES THIS BILL WE ARE CONCERNED ON MANY LEVELS. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT A BILL THAT CARRIES A TITLE OF NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS WOULD ALSO CARRY SPECIFIC LANGUAGE FOR PROMOTING UNPROVEN AND RISKY TECHNOLOGIES LIKE DIRECT AIR CAPTURE. IN CARBON CAPTURE USE AND SEQUESTRATION. WHAT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY CLEAR TO THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING CLOSELY AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES WITHOUT CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION AND ALL THE HYPOTHESIZE FORMS POSES A GROWING AND POORLY UNDERSTOOD THREAT. TO COMMUNITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT. FOR THIS REASON WE THINK THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT REFERS TO NEW CLEAN INDUSTRIAL HUBS COMPLETELY MISREPRESENTS THE TECHNOLOGY BEING PROPOSED. THERE IS NOTHING THAT I NECESSARILY BUT NINE ABOUT THESE PROPOSED INDUSTRIES MISTER HUGHES THE HELICOPTER MACROLIDES MISTER HUGHES THIS IS ACTUALLY THE TIME FOR. FOR NAME ORGANIZATION AND JUST POSITION BUT ONE WE HAD NO LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS I WATCHED YOU PERCENT SO LET ME JUST THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND ASKED THE MODERATOR IF THERE'S ANYBODY ELSE NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION IN OPPOSITION. SECURE THERE'S NO ONE ELSE AT THE MOMENT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL BRING THE MATTER BACK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OR ACTIONS. SENATOR EGGMAN BUT I THINK YOU I WOULD THAT I WOULD THINK IF YOU WORK ON THIS BILL SENATOR AND ALSO ON THAT WORKING TO- WITH THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE IS HARMED WITH THIS AND I WOULD MOVE THE BILL OKAY THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR EGGMAN- ANY OTHER COMMENTS. SENATOR SKINNER YOU MIGHT. END UP. PARDON STERN HELLO I APOLOGIZE SENATOR STERN I DIDN'T SEE OF RECOGNIZE SENATOR STERN. I'LL BE BRIEF MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER DILIGENCE HERE AND- I THINK YOU'VE- GOT A- SMARTER APPROACH TO A COMPLICATED. AREA I THINK YOU'VE EVEN OCULAR IN SOME OF THE- CONCERNS THEY MAY BE OUT THERE FOR THIS SORT OF FUTURE. FACING TECHNOLOGIES IN THE CARBON SEQUESTRATION SPACE I DON'T THINK BUT AS TENSIONS ARE NECESSARILY GOING TO GO AWAY BUT I THINK IT'S- IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO JUST START DOING THE MATH. AND PUT A FRAMEWORK OUT THERE THAT WE CAN BUILD ON SO I THINK THIS IS A REALLY CONSTRUCTIVE VEHICLE AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JUST BEFORE I ASK A SENATOR SKINNER TO CLOSE LET ME JUST SAY CENTER ALAN. IF YOU'RE WITHIN EARSHOT. FILE ITEM MATE SB FOUR THIRTY THREE HIS NEXT UP AND WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU AND- ROOM. A SENATOR SKINNER YOU COULD CLOSE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND- BY WILL I THANK THE CHAIR A REMOTE CHAIR FOR HIS COMMENTS- THE I WANTED TO JUST ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION. QUICKLY THE- I SHARE THE CONCERN ABOUT WE SEE A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES ARE CLAIMING THAT THEY CAN- ENGAGING CARBON CAPTURE AND WE'VE NOT REALLY SEEN REAL PROOF OF THAT AND SO BY NO MEANS DO I WANT TO CREATE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE WOULD- ALLOW FOR- QUESTIONABLE TECHNOLOGIES WITHIN THIS REGISTRY. AND IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I STATED THAT MY PURPOSE IS TO TRY TO PREVENT GREENWASHING. AND THAT WHAT THE BILL THE ONE TECHNOLOGY IT DOES REFERENCE IS SOMETHING CALLED DIRECT AIR CAPTURE BUT DIRECT AIR CAPTURE IS DIFFERENT THAN CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE- AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH OF A DEMONSTRATION OF THAT PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY BUT IT MAY BE A VERY. VIABLE ONE AND SO WE DON'T WANT TO- JUST KNOCK IT OUT WITHOUT. IT WITHOUT IT REALLY BEING ABLE TO SEE WHAT ITS POTENTIAL IS BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT DAY AND CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE.

STERN HI OKAY THEN AS FIVE VOTE SUCH ENOUGH BUT WE'LL PUT IT ON CALL FOR THE REST OF THE SENATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR SKINNER MOVED A FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB FOR THIRTY THREE SENATOR ALAN. WELCOME TO THE COMMISSION. RUNNING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN. VENDA HERE SIR FEBRUARY LOOKS LIKE A ON MY PRESERVATION HERE TO WEIGH MY COLLEAGUES- BUT I'M GLAD YOU'RE STILL HERE MISTER CHAIR. LET ME- LET ME JUST START BY THINKING FATEH COMMITTEE. FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT WAS PUT INTO THE BILL I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE IT WILL IT WILL IMPROVE THE COASTAL COMMISSION'S ABILITY. TO IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE THE COASTAL ACCESS AND PROTECT COASTAL WETLANDS AND STREAMS AND FORESTS. I ENDANGERED SPECIES HABITAT AGRICULTURAL LANDS SCENIC WATER VIEWS SAYS LOW COST RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. DESPITE BEING THE LEAD AGENCY TASKED WITH IMPLEMENTING THE COASTAL ACT THE COASTAL COMMISSION STARKLY HAS HAD LIMITED ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE LAW. ORIGINALLY ONLY THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL I COULD BRING A CASE AGAINST AN ENTITY FOR VIOLATING THE ACT IN ONLY A COURT COULD IMPOSE MONETARY PENALTIES. THE COURSE FOLLOWING THE MANY REPORTS AND ANALYSES DONE BY THE ALLEY- HIGHLIGHTING THE- A CUMBERSOME PROCESS THAT RESULTS IN FEW FINES AND PENALTIES ISSUED BY THE COMMISSION. DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF PURSUING ENFORCEMENT THROUGH THE COURTS IS THAT. THE ONLY- FINDING- DEEMED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE COMMISSION WAS GRANTED LIMITED AUTHORITY TO ISSUE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES FOR PUBLIC ACCESS VIOLATIONS ONLY THIS IS THE PRO TIMES BUILT. AND WAS ASKED TO REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. SINCE THEN THE COMMISSION WAS ABLE TO WIN THE SO PROGRAMS BUILT- AND SINCE THEN THE COMMISSION'S ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO MORE EFFECTIVELY RESOLVE PUBLIC ACCESS CASES THE AVERAGE TIME REQUIRED TO CLOSE THE CASE STRENGTH FROM THREE YEARS TO THREE MONTHS. THE INCENTIVE ACTUALLY WAS SO STRONG THAT 95% OF CASES WERE CLOSED BEFORE VOLUNTARY COOPERATION 90% OF THOSE- WERE WITHOUT ANY PENALTIES ISSUES AND THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT FOLKS NEED TO. TO RECOGNIZE- BUT HAVING. THE ENFORCEMENT POWER. BROUGHT PEOPLE TO THE TABLE IN A WAY THAT THEY WEREN'T. COMING TO THE TABLE BEFORE. AND AS I SAY NINETY PERCENT. OF THE- OF THE CASES WERE RESOLVED WITH LITERALLY NO PENALTY ISSUE. SO THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT. THIS THREAT IS AN IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR RESOLVING VIOLATIONS WITHOUT LITIGATION- BUT ALSO THERE'S THE TRACK RECORD SHOWS- LEASE THE DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT THE THAT THE COMMISSION CAN WORK RESPONSIBLY WITH LANDOWNERS TO ACHIEVE RESULTS FOR THE BENEFIT THE PUBLIC- YOU KNOW I DO KNOW. THERE ARE SOME- CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY TO THE COMMISSION DOES ITS WORK AND CERTAINLY ONE THING I'M VERY INTERESTED IN DOING IS WORKING WITH. THE HOLDERS AND PEOPLE WHO SHARE THE- HAVE THOSE CONCERNS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE COMMISSION IS ACTING RESPONSIBLY I DON'T WANT THEM TO ACT IN AN IMPERIOUS MANNER BUT- WE ALSO WE DO HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE. BECAUSE LIKE IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING. FOR PUBLIC ACCESS AND ALSO FOR. NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND PRESERVATION- YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE SITUATIONS- LET'S SAY A DEVELOPER FAILS TO COMPLY WITH PERMIT CONDITIONS ARE UNDERTAKES ON PERMITTED ACTIVITIES SUCH AS BULLDOZING WETLANDS DIVERTING DISCHARGING INTO COASTAL STREAMS CLEARING ENDANGERED SPECIES HABITAT TO PROTECT YOU TO BUILD PUTTING GREENS- YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THERE'S JUST SO LITTLE FEAR OF CONSEQUENCES IN THE COMMISSION HAS LITTLE RECOURSE. CASES EVER MAIN RUN RESULT FOR YEARS ALLOWING UNDER ONGOING DAMAGE TO PUBLIC RESOURCES AND COSTING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN STAFF TIME AND RESOURCES. FOR THIS BILL BUILDS ON THE COMMISSION'S EXISTING PROVEN PROCESS. TIME I AND SO THAT YOU KNOW AND I GUESS THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THAT- THE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH MOST OF THE CONCERNS I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE COASTAL COMMISSION'S. BEHAVIOR HAVE REALLY CENTERED ON ISSUES RELATING TO PUBLI ACCESS THIS THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH UPON THAT ISSUE THE ACTUALLY DEALS WITH EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE IN THE COASTAL ACT NOT PUBLIC ACCESS AND IT'S- THINGS THAT I KNOW. SO MANY PEOPLE IN MALIBU IN OTHER PLACES ALONG THE COAST. SO LOVE ABOUT THE COASTAL ACT AFFECTED BECAUSE LIKE FOR TAX. CUTS RESOURCES- YOU KNOW BEHIND FLORA FAUNA ETCETERA. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE COASTAL COMMISSION IS ABLE TO. I DO IT'S IMPORTANT WORK IN IN. IN IN ENSURING THAT THE COASTAL ACT IN THE PROTECTIONS IN THE COASTAL ACT WITH REGARDS TO WETLANDS AND FORESTS AND ENDANGERED SPECIES HABITAT IS ACTUALLY EFFECTUATED. NOW WITH THAT I HAVE BEEN A BUNCH GO HERE FROM BECAUSE THE COMMISSION ALSO DANIEL WILSON WITH UNITE HERE LOCAL ELEVEN. AND CERTAINLY ASK YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY MEMBERS.

OUR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF SENATOR JONES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR'S GONNA TAKE SOME AMENDMENTS- THEY'RE GONNA SPEAK TO DUE PROCESS AND I WAS JUST WONDERING IF- THE AUTHOR WOULD CARE TO SPEAK TO THAT AND- EXPLAINED WHAT THAT HOW MAY NOT BE JUST CLARIFY AUTHOR THESE ARE THE AMENDMENTS YOU SAID YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR STATEMENT YES I AM I AM I AM I THOUGHT SUCCESSFULLY AMENDMENTS AND SO- ON. OKAY SO THE BILL DOES ON THE DUE PROCESS TO ASSIGNMENTS IT'S AN IMPORTANT TIME THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT OUT OF THE BILL PROVIDES FOR A SIXTY DAY GRACE PERIOD FOR VIOLATORS. TO VOLUNTARILY. RESOLVE VIOLATIONS WITH NO PENALTY- A VOTE OF THE FOR COMMISSION. THE NEW PUBLIC HEARING ORDER TO ASSESS THE PENALTY AND IT'S ALL DONE ACCORDING TO BAGLEY KEENE- DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS TO ALLEGED VIOLATORS- THAT INCLUDES A JUDICIAL REVIEW- IN THE DEPOSITION OF ALL FINES INTO THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY'S VIOLATION REMEDIATION ACT WHICH IS THAT USED TO SUPPORT. RESTORATION AND PRESERVATION PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS AS OPPOSED TO SO IT DOESN'T IT'S A VERY- CONFINED FIVE AND THERE WAS CONCERN IN THE PAST THAT. I WAS GOING INTO A GENERAL FUND IN THAT THERE WAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND SO THIS IS- THAT'S RESOLVED THROUGH. THROUGH THE SPECIAL ACCOUNT THAT'S BEEN THAT'S BEEN CREATED- SO THE SO THERE IS A YES AND IT IN INTO THE CITY COPY TO- WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND MEMBERS ON ON ON FURTHER DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS IF THAT'S OF INTEREST. THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW ON THE NOTE OF. EACH ONE OF YOUR- SUPPORTING WITNESSES MENTIONED THAT THERE'S THREE THOUSAND OUTSTANDING CASES. FIVE I HEARD THAT CORRECTLY- IF THIS BILL PASSES IS THERE KIND OF ANY. FILE I'M HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE TO CLEAN THOSE UP CLEAR THOSE UP. YES TO THE ISSUE I'VE BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT WHEN THE PROTEST AND ARMS WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE PRO TEM'S BILL THIS IS THE BILL. THAT WAS PASSED BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN- THE- THE ACT OF GIVING THEM. HE HAS A LITTLE BIT MORE AND FOR GOOD FORTUNE PACKAGE LITTLE IT WAS JUST IT WAS STILL IT WAS IT HAD TO BE DONE BY THE AG I MEAN THE VA G. POLICE THE- THE ACT AND IT WAS JUST A ABSOLUTE IMPOSSIBILITY THE AG JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE BANDWIDTH. SO GIVING THEM THIS ENFORCEMENT POWER. DRAMATICALLY IN DEBT. INCREASED COMPLIANCE- TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE PUBLIC ACCESS QUESTIONS OF THE TO LITERALLY 95% OF THE- CASES WERE CLOSE WITH FULL VOLUNTARY COOPERATION. ON BOTH SIDES 90% OF THEM HOW WERE ISSUED WE'RE DONE WITH NO PENALTIES ISSUED. THE STATE A LOT OF MONEY ON LITIGATION. I RECEIVED A LOT OF TIME THE CASES WENT FROM BEING RESOLVED IN THREE YEARS TO THREE MONTHS THE AVERAGE. SO- YOU KNOW THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE IS THIS IS A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO BASICALLY I MEAN I YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS THE CASE THEY JUST THEY JUST KNOW THAT THE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION DOESN'T HAVE THE REAL POWER TO- AND- WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE TO ENFORCE SOME OF THESE VIOLATIONS AND- AND SO FOLKS DISCOUNT ON THE GO POUND SAND AND THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT THAT CAN BE DONEIN THESE THINGS AND GETTING STUCK. IN YEARS AND YEARS OF- OF DEBATING AND BY THE WAY THE WHAT THE OTHER QUESTION TO THE OTHER POINT TO BRING UP SOMETIMES THESE THINGS TO GO TO COURT AND THERE WAS A RECENT COURT CASE WHERE THE COURT AND SAID IT IS ACTUALLY MENTIONED IN- ON ON PAGES FOUR AND FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS- IT WAS A CASE WHERE. WAS A BIG. RENT FOR THE STRUCTURES THAT. BUILT THAT IMPEDED PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE BEACH IN VIOLATION OF THE OF THE COASTAL ACT AND- YOU KNOW THE- THE- SERVICE WAS DONE THIS IS THIS IS ALL HAPPENING LONG BEFORE. LONG BEFORE THE BILL HAPPEN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND YOU KNOW. THE LAND THE LAND OWNER WHO WINNER WAS BASICALLY RENTING OUT A PROPERTY FOUR THOUSAND BUCKS AND I CALLING IT A PRIVATE BEACH. AND CLEAR VIOLATION THE COASTAL ACTIVITY BASICALLY TOLD THE CHEMICALS LIKE TO GO POUND SAND AND EVENTUALLY OF COURSE THE LEGISLATION CHANGE THEY HAD THEY HAD SOME MORE ENFORCEMENT POWER IN THIS WAS THE END OF THIS WENT TO COURT. AND THE COURT ACTUALLY FOUND NOT ONLY FOR THE GOAL SOUNDS AND WITH THE BEACH TERM YES EXACTLY- OF THE PLAN WAS INTENDED RIGHT. HEY. BUT HE DIDN'T THE YOU KNOW THE EVENTS THE OTHER KEY THING IN THE COURT CASES THAT THEY FOUND- THE COURT THAT THE APPEALS COURT ACTUALLY WENT TO APPEALS COURT AND THEY DETERMINED THAT- THAT THERE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL DUE PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH BECAUSE THE COMMISSION'S APPROACH AND SENATOR JONES WAS AT RESPONSIVE TO YOUR QUESTION I THINK SO YES. OKAY THANK YOU. OTHER OR COMMENTS. GOVERNMENTS ARE APOLOGIZE AGAIN SENATOR STERN I'M GONNA GO RIGHT TO YOU. THANKS MISTER CHAIR- GOOD THE CALLING WE APPRECIATE AT THE GATES AND I JUST WANT TO THANK. I KNOW THE AUTHOR- STRETCHED HERE AND DUG IN WITH THE COMMITTEE AND- THE EXTENSIVE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU SEE IN THE ANALYSIS- ARE THE PRODUCT OF. A S. LONG SERIES OF DISCUSSIONS TO TRY TO PUT A FRAMEWORK TOGETHER HERE THAT. THAT ISN'T JUST TAILORED TO A PUBLIC ACCESS VIOLATION WHICH WAS THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BILL BUT REALLY TAILORED TO THESE OTHER. KINDS OF IMPACTS. YOU KNOW DUMPING ON BEACHES OR DAMAGE TO ENVIRONMENT SENSITIVE HABITAT- OR SEEN MINING MAYBE NOT COUNTING OF SAND BUT MINING OF SAND AND THE REALLY EGREGIOUS VIOLATION SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT AN ADDITIONAL INTO YOUR YOUR- EFFORT ON ENSURING THERE'S- MISTER DUE PROCESS AND A FAIR PROCESS HERE. THROUGH THE LEGISLATION AND THAT'S ALSO DEALING WITH THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY ISSUE AS WELL AS THE CURE PERIOD BEING EXTENDED TO SIXTY DAYS- AND THE RIGHT TO APPEAL OBVIOUSLY BUT THE OTHER KEY ELEMENTS THERE WE APPRECIATE. YOU ALL AND YOUR SUPPORTERS FOR MEETING US ON OUR PRESERVING ALSO THE ABILITY FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DO BUILDING CODE ENFORCEMENT ON THEIR OWN AND I THINK THAT'S OFTEN WHEN WE GET SOME OF THE BEST OUTCOMES IS WHERE THE SMALLER VIOLATIONS. ARE DEALT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT BY WITH BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ANYONE ELSE E. P. N. AND OTHER CODES THAT THEY CAN FORCE MORE NAME BILLION THAT HAVE THE COASTAL COMMISSION GO AFTER. THE BIG THINGS THAT SORT OF DEFIANT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABILITY TO. TO DO THE JOB HERE- SO THANKS FOR MAKING ALL THOSE- AND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BILL AND I. I I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. BOB THANK YOU SENATE STERN PROMISES SHARE PRICE WITH THE COMMON AND JUST ALSO SAID. THAT MAKE MARK AND UP.

AWESOME CHALLENGES WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION- SOME A VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION'S WORK SO IT'S A MIX IT'S KIND OF SIMILAR TO CENTER LAIRD'S DISTRICT. IN THAT RESPECT AND SO WE WORK HARD TOGETHER TO GET THE BILL TO A PLACE WHERE WE'RE BEING RESPECTFUL OF. LANDOWNERS AND- AND FOLKS ON THE GROUND AND INTO COASTAL COMMUNITIES WHILE ALSO AT THE SAME TIME. HI MAKING SURE THAT THE- WEEK WE GIVE THE COASTAL COMMISSION THE TOOLS IT NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT THE COST ELECT ISRAEL. THAT THE PROTECTIONS AND PROVISIONS IN THE COASTAL ACT THAT CONTINUE TO BE INCREDIBLY POPULAR AROUND THE STATE. REALLY TREASURED AROUND THE STATE.

LAST YEAR ON CONSENT IN A COUPLE WEEKS AGO OUT OF TURN US IN TRANSPORTATION THIS YEAR THE BILL PASSED OFF THE ASSEMBLY FOR MIDNIGHT AND US ON THE LAST NIGHT OF THE SESSION AND UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO COME BACK TO THE SENATE. CONCURRENCE FOR FINAL VOTE OR WOULD HAVE BEEN- WRAPPED UP LAST YEAR I THINK- I'M RUNNING THIS BILL BECAUSE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CURRENTLY COMPETITION OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES ARE REGISTERED TO CARDS RED STICKER PROGRAM. TWO YEARS AGO CARD DECIDED THE IN THIS TICKET RED CIRCLE PROGRAM IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND NO OTHER AGENCY AT THAT TIME PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO REPLACE THE PROGRAM. WITHOUT A NEW PROGRAM- OHB COMPETITIONS AND PRACTICE WRITING BELIEVE PUT TO AN END ON CALIFORNIA LANDS. ADDITIONALLY LOCAL ECONOMIES THAT RELY ON THE SPORT WOULD BE DECIMATED BY A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR REVENUE LOSS. IN ORDER TO SAVE A LOT OF SPORT WITH A LONG HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA THIS BILL CREATES A REPLACEMENT REGISTRATION PROGRAM. THROUGH THE PARKS DEPARTMENT. BY OFFICE HAS SPENT OVER A YEAR WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING O. H. V. COMPETITION ORGANIZATIONS- H. B. MANUFACTURERS AND SEVERAL STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING PARKS DMV AND CAR.

MISTER CHAIR NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNALED THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE MATTERS BACK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE OR THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FROM FEBRUARY BACK IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMITTEE ACTION QUESTIONS COMMENTS. CENTER WEISSE. THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE AGAIN THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH WITH FOR YEARS HERE WHERE- RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES- FOR. OR OFFROAD VEHICLES HAVE BEEN GRADUALLY BEEN REDUCE REDUCE REDUCE TO THE POINT THAT- PEOPLE THAT DO WANNA RECREATE WITH THEIR OFF ROAD VEHICLES HAVE REALLY KNOW WHERE TO GO- AND THIS OFTEN LEADS TO- THE- PEOPLE USING THEIR VEHICLES ON ON SENSITIVE HABITAT. AND AGAIN IT TO PUTS PUTS OUR OUR POLICE RESOURCES OF OUR THE STATE'S ABILITY TO REALLY PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT MIX OF JUST MUCH HARDER. OF I DON'T KNOW THAT I THOUGHT THAT THIS BILL IS NECESSARILY A CONCORDE THAT- THE PROCESS OF THE STATE ENGAGED ELIMINATE THIS PROGRAM I DON'T KNOW IF IT REALLY PUT A NUMBER OF PRICE TAG. ON ON WHAT BURDEN THIS WOULD PUT ON OUR STATE POLICING POWERS. AND ENSURING THAT WE CAN. KEEP PEOPLE OFF OF SURFACE SENSITIVE HABITAT THAT'S ALREADY PROBLEM I THINK ELIMINATING THIS PROGRAM WILL JUST MAKE IT WORSE. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO FIND A SENSIBLE AREA. TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO RECREATE EVEN IF THE I MEAN THE PAY THEY'RE PAYING FOR IT UNDER THIS PROGRAM. IT'LL PROVIDE AREAS WHERE THEY CAN RECREATE SAFELY AND IN A WAY IT DOESN'T DESTROY THE ENVIRONMENT AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS I THINK WE HAVE TO CONTINUE WORKING ON I APPRECIATE THAT THIS AUTHORS TAKEN. ON THIS DIFFICULT ISSUE THERE'S STRONG ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES BUT I TEND TO- FALL ON THE SIDE OF. YOU KNOW THIS LOTS OF PEOPLE ON THESE VEHICLES THE SOLUTION SHOULD ALWAYS BE. YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY A NEW VEHICLE. WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO GRADUALLY. MOVE PEOPLE INTO- CLEANER VEHICLES. IN A WAY THAT IT DOESN'T PROVIDE A FINANCE A HUGE HUGE FINANCIAL BURDEN. AND IT HAS SINCE THAT RULE WOULD WOULD BRING AN END TO. A RIP OFF ROAD VEHICLES IN ANY PART OF THE STATE. AND THEN I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL WILL FIGHT THAT BY BASICALLY RIGHT IN THEIR VEHICLES ILLEGALLY IN SENSITIVE HABITAT AND IT'S GONNA- PROVIDE ENORMOUS COSTS TO OUR STATE POLICE IN THAT ACTIVITY AND- WE CAN FIND COMMON GROUND I THINK THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO DO THAT AND- IT'S PART TO KEEP THIS PROGRAM GOING. SOMEHOW IN A WAY THAT- THIS IS- THIS IS A LITTLE MORE A REASONABLE AS OPPOSED TO JUST BASICALLY ENDING THE USE AND REQUIRING PEOPLE TO GO BY THE NEW VEHICLES AND THEN AND THEN HAVE TO. I DON'T UNDER THIS PROGRAM WITH IT WILL WE- EVEN IF THEY WILL EVEN BE ALLOWED TO USE THEIR- RECREATIONAL VEHICLES AND SENSITIVE I MEAN AND CONTROLLED AREAS BECAUSE- BASICALLY ELIMINATES PROGRAM SO- I'M GONNA SPORTIST TODAY FROM WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO- SEE IF WE COULD FIND IF THIS BILL CAN SOLVE THE CURRENT PROBLEM FACING OUR STATE. THANK YOU BYE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE ON MOST OF THEN I'LL TAKE THAT AS A MOTION BOOKMAKER COMMON BEFORE WE GO TO CLOSE. THE ED- I THINK. IN ORDER SOME REAL CONCERNS THAT ARE LEGIT- IS A THE OFF HIGHWAY MOTOR ARE 20% OF THE VEHICLES AND- IT SHOULD BE THAT HAVE A- SOME OF THE- RED STICKER ONES WITHOUT- THE EXHAUST ONE MESSAGE IT'S UP TO TWENTY FIVE TIMES THE EXHAUST EMISSIONS LIMITS SO. I THINK THERE'S GENUINE CONCERNS HERE ADAM ARE THE AUTHOR SAID HE'S GOING TO MEET WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND NEXT WEEK SO I THINK WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS BE WILLING TO VOTE TO MOVE THIS BILL ALONE BUT I REALLY RESERVE THE RIGHT TO OPPOSE IT AND APPROPRIATIONS OR THE FLOOR IF SOME OF THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED IN SOME WAY SATISFACTORY. SO RIVER MOTION ORDER OTHER COMMENTS BEFORE I ASK THE AUTHOR TO CLOSE SENATE- I'M SORRY SENATOR GROVE. AND SENATOR STERN AFTER CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I KNOW THERE'S A LARGE COMMUNITY OF THE WHICH THE OPERATORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEIR LAND AND THEIR USE OF THE LAND EVEN WITH THE RED STICKER GREEN STICKER. ALL THAT STUFF THAT'S BEEN IMPOSED OVER THE YEARS HAS BEEN LIMITED AND THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT SET FOR AT CLOSING A- ONE OF THEIR PARKS- SORRY I KNOW THEIR FRUSTRATION ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT- IT'S THEIR HOBBY I GUESS ARE THERE. AND WHAT THEY DO AND- ALTHOUGH I DON'T DO IT I KNOW YOU DO MOTORCYCLES AND STUFF BUT NOT TO THE EXTENT THESE GENTLEMEN ARE THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE DOING- M. DIS AT WRITING AND WHEN YOU SAY YOU YOU WEREN'T MEETING SENATOR EGGMAN YOU MIGHT SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY SENATOR CHALLENGES. JUST CLARIFYING THAT ONE YES NOT. EGGMAN SENATOR JONES. I SEND A EGGMAN. SHE COULD READ TO ME IN MY- AND IS SO AT JUST. THE ON BRING IT FORWARD I DO HAVE A LOT OF- EACH YEAR. IN MY JUST THAT REAL ENJOY. EMPIRE AND REALLY ENJOY THE- BUILT FOR. CAL SEPT YOU. THANK YOU FOR MUCH SO STERN. THANK YOU MISS CHAIR- JUST VERY BRIEFLY I KNOW YOU GUYS BEEN THE SENATE. I WAS OVER IN ANOTHER TO PER. I'M SO WE COULDN'T. RESULT WHICH SENATOR JONES AND YOUR BILL HERE- I UNDERSTAND. ARE AT LIBERTY VOTE IS AS THEY SAY CHOOSE. I WILL BE OPPOSING THE BILL- TODAY AND IT'S FORM I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR TO SEEING IF THERE'S ANY FRUIT THAT IS BORN OUT OF- UPCOMING CONVERSATIONS BEFORE THE FLOOR BUT- I JUST HAVE SOME FUNDAMENTAL. PRINCIPLE CONCERNS ABOUT ANY BILL THAT OVERRIDES A ARBY'S RULES- FOR- H. REASON SPECIFICALLY IN THIS- YOU KNOW WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO EMISSIONS CONTROLS I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S ONE OF THOSE INVIOLABLE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT- OVER WRITING AT BY STATUTE I THINK THE EXISTING REGULATORY PROCESS SHOULD BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THAT SO. UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T BE THERE TODAY BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR GOOD FAITH ENGAGEMENT CENTER JONES ON THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU CENTER- SAYING NO OTHER HANDS UP SENATOR JOHN YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IF I CAN ADDRESS JUST A COUPLE OF TINGS THAT THE- OPPOSITION BROUGHT UP IN A STATEMENT AND AGAIN I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO OF A POSITIVE MEETING WITH THEM. NEXT WEEK WE HAVE CONTINUED TO OFFER. AMENDMENTS AS THIS HAS WORKED TO THE PROCESS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS. ONE OF THE THINGS OPPOSITION CONTINUES TO SAY THIS IS A AN EXPANDED PROGRAM AND I UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM AND THAT. YOU KNOW CARP HAS ELIMINATED THIS AND SO NOW KEEPING A GOING IN AT ANY LEVELS AN EXPANSION IT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT WERE. WERE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES REGISTERED EACH YEAR FROM SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED. AND THOSE REGISTRATIONS HAVE TO BE FROM LEGITIMATE- COMPETITIVE. RACERS THAT ARE ARE PART OF A LEGITIMATE RACING ORGANIZATION. AND SO THERE IS SOME- REGULATION THERE- SPEAKING TO THE ERROR- QUALITY OF THESE MORE CYCLES I THINK THE ARGUMENT WAS MADE THAT- THERE ANYWHERE FROM ONE AND A HALF TIMES MORE POLLUTING TO TWO AND A HALF TIMES MORE POLLUTING PER. VEHICLE AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT IT BUT LET'S ASSUME THAT IT IS- THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THIS BILL AGAIN AS WERE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES BY 93% SO OVERALL THERE'S GOING TO BE A NET. DECREASE IN THE- EMISSIONS FROM THESE VEHICLES. ARE ONE OF THE OTHER. ARGUMENTS MADE BY THE OPPOSITION. THAT I ACTUALLY SUPPORT I THINK SUPPORTS TO BILLS IF WE DON'T HAVE A PROGRAM THEN. THESE FOLKS STILL HAVE ACCESS TO. PRIVATE LANDS IN CAN RACE ON PRIVATE LANDS INTO THE PRACTICE SOME PROBLEMS RIGHT THAT'S TRUE- BUT ANYMORE ON REGULATED- ENVIRONMENT AND THEN WHAT WOULD BE WHAT DOES THIS BILL ACTUALLY CONTEMPLATES MORE REGULATION. THAN THAT SCENARIO CONTEMPLATES IN THAT THE TO BE REGISTERED IN THIS NEW PROGRAM THE VEHICLES HAVE TO SPARK ARRESTORS AFTER MUFFLERS. YOU KNOW THERE'S OTHER SAFETY EQUIPMENT THAT ARE REQUIRED. AND SO THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO PUBLIC LANDS SO THAT THESE. RACERS AND THESE COMPETITORS WANT TO HAVE A VEHICLE THAT IS COMPLIANT WITH THIS PROGRAM. AND IS ACTUALLY SAFER THAN IF WE HAVE NO PROGRAM. SO I'M HOPING THAT THAT WILL- SPEAK TO SOME THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS. THIS IS A MUCH NEEDED REPLACEMENT REGISTRATION PROGRAM TO ALLOW THESE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE COME JUST AS TO CONTINUE AGAIN THE BILL IS NARROWLY CONTENT. TAILORED WITH ONLY FIVE HUNDRED REDUCING THE NUMBER OF FIVE HUNDRED FROM SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THEY HAVE TO BE COMPETITIVE- LEGITIMATE COMPETITORS AS I STATED BEFORE SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS IN SUPPORT- I APPRECIATE CHAIRMAN STEARNS CONCERNS WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH HIM. IS APPRECIATE SUBSTITUTE CHAIRMAN US- LETTERS COMMENTS AND YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO. KEEP IN THE LOOP AS I HAVE THIS CONVERSATION SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NINE IS B.

THESE PRIORITIES EVERY YEAR SHOW THEIR OF THEIR TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT- I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME IN MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL. I HOPE TO CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH THEM AS IT MOVES FORWARD THE ANALYSIS IS VERY HELPFUL AND MAKE SOME GOOD SUGGESTIONS ON SOME PLACES TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO DO THAT. I FEEL LIKE I DON'T HAVE TO TELL EVERYBODY HERE. THAT RECENT FIRES HAVE DEVASTATED THE STATE. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS IN TWENTY TWENTY ALONE THERE WERE OVER EIGHT THOUSAND WILDLAND FIRES THAT BURNED ALMOST FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION ACRES. BREAKING THE PREVIOUS RECORD OF ONE POINT MILLION ACRES SET IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH JUST HAPPENED TO BE THE LAST YEAR I WAS SECRETARY FOR NATURAL RESOURCES AND- AND WORKING WITH CAL FIRE. OF FIVE OF THIS LARGEST FOR AND STATE'S HISTORY BURNED AT THE SAME TIME IN TWENTY TWENTY. ALREADY IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE BEEN% OVER EIGHT HUNDRED FIRES BURNING THREE THOUSAND ACRES- DECADES OF FIRE SUPPRESSION AND THEN BITING UP AGAINST THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED THE SIZE AND INTENSITY OF FIRE ACROSS THE STATE. EARLIER THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE WHICH INCLUDES THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND CAL FAR. RELEASED CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRES AND FOREST RESILIENCE ACTION PLAN. THIS BILL- TAKES THAT PLAN WHICH WILL OUT A FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY FOR THE STATE TO UTILIZE AND IMPROVE FIRE RESILIENCE AND PUTS IT INTO LAW. SO IT REQUIRES THE STATE TO IMPLEMENT AND REGULARLY UPDATE THE ACTION PLAN REPORT REQUIRES A REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS. AND SO HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IS S.

WILL NOW MOVE TO FINALIZE ON THIRD SB FIVE EIGHTY SENATORS. THANK YOU MISTER SHE- MEMBERS. SENATE BILL FIVE EIGHTY TWO ATTEMPTS BE. THANK FRAMEWORK TO PUSH US FORWARD- CALIFORNIA'S LONG PRIDED ITSELF ON ITS CLIMATE LEADERSHIP. AND AT THIS MOMENT- WE'RE AT RISK OF BEING LEFT BEHIND- ALREADY WE'VE SEEN THE PRESIDENT COMMIT TO MORE AGGRESSIVE- TWENTY THIRTY TARGETS AT JUSTICE FORTY FRAMEWORK THEY TRULY PRIORITIZES THE FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS A- MERICAN JOBS PLANNED. HIGHLIGHTS THE VALUE OF UNION LABOR IN IN DOING THIS WORK- THAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO BATTLE THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THERE'S THREE PARTS TO THE LEGISLATION ONE IS THE ACCELERATING OUR MITIGATION PATH OR TRAJECTORY TOWARDS TWENTY THIRTY- ONE IS THE CLIMATE. FRAMEWORK IS YOUR WHICH IS REALLY AT THE HEART OF THE BILL AND THE THESIS THERE IS THAT. CARBON NEUTRALITY IS- SIMPLY NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO AVOID THE MOST EGREGIOUS INJUSTICES OF CLIMATE CHANGE THAT IN FACT WE ACTION NEED TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS IF WE LOCK IN EVEN BUSINESS AS USUAL TODAY- OR EVEN THE CONCENTRATIONS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WILL BE IMPACTED UNJUSTLY FOR POLLUTION THEY NEVER COST TO THE RESTORATION FRAMEWORK IS SORT OF THE ANCHOR PIECE IN THE CENTER AND THEN LASTLY WE PUT A JUST RESILIENCE FRAMEWORK TO TRY TO DRIVE. BOTH STATE FEDERAL AND- OVERALL PRIORITIZATION- WHEN WE INVEST IN RESILIENCE IN THE STATE TO PRIORITIZE THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES FIRST AND TO DO THAT WORK- WITH THE BEST SKILLED LABOR WE POSSIBLY CAN- I CAN GO THROUGH SOME OF THE DAMAGES WITH YOU ALL- I KNOW WE'VE GOT IT HAD A LONG HEARING HERE BUT- YOU. DON'T NEED ANY REMINDERS ABOUT. THE RAVAGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE WITH YOUR DISTRICT IS IMPACTED BY THE DROUGHT- OR BY WILDFIRES OR BY SEA LEVEL RISE FOR BY FLOOD RISK OR MAYBE BYALL OF THEM OR BY EXTREME HEAT- THIS IS A- MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR. PROBLEM AND EVEN FOR CALIFORNIA ITSELF THE PRICE TAG WILL BE ASTONISHING SO WE HAVE TO GET MOVING HERE AND- WE REALLY TRY TO PUT A BILL TOGETHER THAT. CHALLENGES FOLKS TO GET OUTSIDE OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE AND COME TO SOME CONSENSUS- ON WHAT ON WHAT'S TRULY POSSIBLE- BUT I JUST WANTED TO NOTE AT THE OUTSET. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO INITIATE- A BIGGER TENTS WITH THIS LEGISLATION AND TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS BOTH FROM- THOSE IN FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES WHO WANT MORE SPECIFICITY AROUND THE FRAMEWORK ESPECIALLY AROUND CARBON REMOVAL. BUT ALSO- FROM OUR FRIENDS IN ORGANIZED LABOR AND- INDUSTRY ITSELF WHICH WE NEED TO HAVE TRULY IS PARTNERS HERE- I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO RUN OVER THE CORPORATION'S A CALIFORNIA AND SOLVE CRIME IN THE PROCESS WE TRULY NEED. PARTNERSHIP SO WE'RE WE'RE COMMITTED TO TRYING TO FIND THAT CONSENSUS- IN THIS LEGISLATION AND YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST CONCERN I HAVE RIGHT NOW AND THE REASON- WE'RE MOVING THE BILL TODAY- AND NOT SORT OF SLOWING DOWN AT LEAST. FOR THE MOMENT- IN MAKING THIS A TO YOUR BILL- BUT INSTEAD GETTING INTO APPROPRIATIONS WHERE WE CAN- SEE WHERE THINGS STAND. BUT IF WE DEFERRED THIS THORNY TO THE ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW TO DEVELOP THE NEXT PHASES SCOPING PLAN OR TO PUT TOGETHER THE- THE FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTMENT IN RESILIENCE- AT AND THE CARBON REMOVAL FRAMEWORK FRANKLY. THERE WERE DIFFERING. REALLY IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY MAKING AUTHORITY- AT I THINK THE- OUGHT TO HAVE IT'S HERE IN THAT. NOW IF THAT COMES TOGETHER BEFORE TE FLOOR I'M I'M NOT SURE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO BRING YOU SOMETHING- TO THE FLOOR THAT DOESN'T HAVE THAT BIG TENT CONSENSUS SO IF WE CAN'T REACH THAT- WE'RE NOT GOING TO. PUSH THE ENVELOPE TOO FAR BUT I ACTUALLY I THINK WE'VE GOT A SHOT HERE SO- WITH THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE SENATOR. WITH TWO WITNESSES THAT ARE LEAD IN SUPPORT KELLY CALLING FROM THE CLIMATE CENTER AND ALEX JACKSON FROM THE NATIONAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL FOR BOTH ON THE CONFERENCE LINE. LET'S BEGIN WITH ALY KHAN WELCOME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING SURE LAYERED AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MONEY TO ELLIE COHEN CEO OF THE CLIMATE CENTER A POLICY NONPROFIT WORKING FOR RAPID GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS OF SCALE. I'M HONORED TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE EIGHTY TWO. A SCIENCE BASED BILL THAT WILL CODIFY THE FIRST EVER STATUTORY GOAL TO ACHIEVE NET NEGATIVE EMISSIONS. REMOVING MORE CLIMATE POLLUTION THEN WE ADMIT BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. ASCENTIAL FOR SECURING AN EQUITABLE CLIMATE SAFE FUTURE FOR ALL. IT'S BEEN NEARLY THREE YEARS SINCE UNITED NATIONS FIGHTERS CONCLUDED WE HAVE TO CUT EMISSIONS IN HALF BY TWENTY THIRTY WHILE ALSO REMOVING OUR PREVIOUS CLIMATE POLLUTION FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. STUDIES NOW SHOW THE CRIME IT'S WORSENING MUCH FASTER AND THAT WE WILL PASS THE ONE POINT FIVE C. THRESHOLD OF DANGEROUS WARMING WITHIN THE DECADE MUCH EARLIER THAN THE U. N. PROJECTED. CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE SEVERE MULTI DECADE DROUGHT THREATENING OUR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY. COMMUNITIES AN ENVIRONMENT WITH DUST BOWL LIKE CONDITIONS. SB FIVE EIGHTY TWO RECOGNIZES THE URGENT NEED TO ACCELERATE TIMELINES WE TAKE OUR CLIMATE LEADERSHIP AS AN EXAMPLE FOR A COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. I MOVE QUICKLY AND LOCALLY AND PRIORITIZING FRONTLINE COMMUNITY. BY SETTING AN AMBITIOUS TARGET TO HIT NET NEGATIVE EMISSIONS IN JUST OVER A DECADE. SB FIVE EIGHTY TWO ALSO SENDS MAJOR MARKET SIGNALS THE CALIFORNIA IS THE PLACE IN WHICH TO INVEST THEIR DOLLARS. THESE INVESTMENTS WILL DRIVE JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THE STATE IN SECTORS RANGING FROM CLEAN ENERGY AND MANUFACTURING. TWO ZERO EMISSIONS TRANSPORTATION AND REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE WHILE ALSO NETTING NUMEROUS BENEFITS. FROM JOB CREATION AND IMPROVED HEALTH ASSOCIATED WITH BREATHING CLEAN AIR TO REPLENISH GROUNDWATER AND FOOD SECURITY. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND PRIORITIZING NATURAL SEQUESTRATION THIS BILL AND DISTINGUISHING THAT FROM NASCENT DIRECT AIR CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGIES WHICH SHOULD ONLY. BE ADVANCED IF THERE'S EVIDENCE OF NO NOW IMPACTS ON NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES AND THE AND- WITHROW. WORSEN CLIMATE AND- CALIFORNIA MUST. ACCELERATE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS MH MAKE MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN SCALING UP NATURE BASED SEQUESTRATION THEY'LL SB FIVE EIGHTY TWO IS A MAJOR STEP FORWARD.

OKAY THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO BRING THE MATTER BACK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE I'M GONNA TAKE THE LIBERTY OF. JUST MAKING A BRIEF STATEMENT TO FRAME THIS BILL IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS CALTRANS DID A JOB. WHERE ON WITTINGLY THEY CLOSED A CORRUGATED PIPE UNDER THE FREEWAY. AS A RESULT THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS THE MOUNTAIN LINE CROSSING HAS RESOLVED MOUNT POINTS HAVE COME OVER THE TOP. BEEN KILLED THERE ARE THREATENING MOTORISTS AND THE MOUNTAIN LIONS AND SO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE NEGOTIATED A SPECIAL SITUATION. A WITH CALTRANS TURNS OUT THAT THE MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS REQUIRED THE ANIMALS TO BE ENDANGERED. NOT THREATENED THAT WAY BUT ENDANGERED SO WE RE WROTE THE DEFINITION IN THAT INSTANCE THE NEGOTIATED WITH THE LAND TRUST AND CALTRANS. AND BROUGHT FUNDING AND THERE WILL BE A- CROSSING CONSTRUCTED THERE UNDER OR OVER AT SOME POINT. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ATTEMPT TO TAKE WHAT WAS NEGOTIATED THERE AND WORK TO EXTEND IT TO THE REST OF THE STATE AS THE ANALYSIS SAYS IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS. AND I THINK THE QUESTIONS OF FUNDING AND THERE'S QUESTIONS OF HOW TO DO IT BUT- I'D MEYER AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THIS ON. AND I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE THE BILL ALONG AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO CONTINUE TO FLESH THIS OUT AND THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE- THE TESTIMONY SO I WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE- OF THE COMMITTEE.
