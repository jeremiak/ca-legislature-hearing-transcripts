THIS IS ONE OF MANY DEALS BILLS DEALING WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS HERE. LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ON THIS PROCEDURE STAFF WORK ON THIS AS WELL -- LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH -- YOURSELF IN THE OTHER AUTHORS THAT ARE IN THE SAME SPACE. AND WE ALL. ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WE'VE LOOKED AT THIS BUT THEY WILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFERENT TAKES ON IT. AND I THINK AT THE END OF THE THE DAY WE'RE ALL JUST TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD FOR WORKERS GOOD FOR CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY AS WE MOVE INTO THE SPACE. AB FIVE READY FOR WITH ESTABLISH A PROMOTE CALIFORNIA'S ROLE AS A LEADER IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BY DESIGNATING A CHIEF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY COMMISSION ON A AYE THAT WOULD INCLUDE MEMBERS FOR THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR. AND THEN GLUED A REPRESENTATIVE FROM ORGANIZED LABOR. THE COMMISSION WOULD STUDY THE POTENTIAL USES OF A I AM DEVELOPING POLICY FRAMEWORK -- THAT WOULD INCLUDE STRATEGIES TO ONE ESTABLISH AN AN ETHICAL FRAMEWORK TO MAXIMIZE POTENTIAL FOR A AYE TO POSITIVELY AFFECT PEOPLE'S LIVES THREE UTILIZE A AYE -- FOR STATE FUNCTIONS FOR EDUCATE AND TRAIN STUDENTS AND WORKERS IN A AYE. FIVE ANALYZE A MINIMIZE ANY ADVERSE IMPACTS WORKERS. IN ADDITION THE CHIEF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER WOULD ADVISE A CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. IN EVALUATING WORKFORCE EDUCATION TRAINING AN ADVISER DIRECTOR OF TECHNOLOGY IN EVALUATING THE ISSUES OF A AYE AND STATE GOVERNMENT. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO. NOT AN OVERALL PLAN FOR HOW THE STATE SHOULD USE A AYE NOR THEIR FRAMEWORKS AND HOW TO REPAIR WORKERS AND STUDENTS FOR THE COMING CHANGES TO THE ECONOMY. IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA THIS IS. OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE ESPECIALLY WITH -- THE SILICON VALLEY AND OUR GLOBAL LEADERSHIP IN THIS INDUSTRY AND IN THE SECTOR AND THEN -- THIS REGION A I HAS THE POTENTIAL TRANSFORM EVERY SEGMENT OF OUR LIVES IN THE ECONOMY AFTER THIS TREMENDOUS UPSIDES. AN ENORMOUS BENEFITS -- WITH THAT THE BILL HAS OPPOSITION RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I'VE. THANKS VERY MUCH -- WHEN THIS IS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD? I HAVE MORE COMMON SPENCERPORT OUR OPPOSITION -- NEEDS THE VARIOUS WITH SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND REPRESENTING NINETY SIX THOUSAND STATE EMPLOYEES UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THIS BILL WOULD IMPACT OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE WORK FORCE -- JUST JUST I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- SALAS FOR FOR BRINGING TO THE ATTENTION -- THAT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MANY BILLS OUT THERE IN THERE ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTS ON THE WORK FORCE. AND CALIFORNIA IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE A LEADER IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND I DON'T THINK IT'S A MATTER OF IF WE ARE BUT IT'S IT'S A MATTER OF WHAT CAN WE DO WHAT SHOULD WE DO. AND HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT THE WORK FORCE IS -- YOU KNOW INVOLVED IN SOME OF THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE WHEN IT COMES TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SO THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES EITHER IN SUPPORT OR ALL IN OPPOSITION OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. SEEING NONE OPPOSITION OFFICIAL OPPOSITION. LET'S BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COME AS MISTER CALDERON GUY. THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAUCE FOR WAITING IN THE SUBJECT MATTER I HAVE AN AYE AYE BILL THAT I'M WORKING ON SETTING UP WORKING GROUP I KNOW THAT -- THE CHAIR HAS BEEN WORKING ON A AYE ISSUES FOR A LONG TIME BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THE DIFFERENT LEVELS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. I AM VERY LITTLE TO NO REGULATION OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF BIG COMPANIES THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE BUT ALSO AT THE SAME TIME. WE WANT TO AVOID IS THE OPPORTUNITY OR I SHOULD SAY OPPORTUNITY THE THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF SOMETHING BEING CREATED BY A COMPANY THAT CANNOT BE TAKEN BACK -- AND ONCE SOMETHING IS ON THE WORLDWIDE WEB YOU CANNOT YOU CAN YOU CAN'T TURN OFF WHICH YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT BACK -- AND SO I THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD STEP WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING THE STATE REGULATE. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WE NEED TO BE THE LEADER BECAUSE WE ARE THE TECH -- NOT JUST THIS COUNTRY BUT OF THE WORLD -- SO IT IS ON US TO CREATE THE STANDARD OF REGULATION WHEN IT COMES TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE -- WE NEED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION IN THAT AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A LEVEL OF HESITATION WHEN IT COMES TO THE COMPANIES. THAT ARE WORKING ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO KNOW THAT -- WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION AND WHAT THEY DO AND HOW THEY USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW ASKING QUESTIONS SUCH AS IF I AM. LOOKING UP SOMETHING POLITICAL. BECAUSE I HAVE CERTAIN GOOGLE SEARCHES THROUGH THAT MEAN THAT I SHOULD CONTINUE TO SEE THE THINGS THAT I THAT. WHATEVER ALGORITHM ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS IN PLACE ONCE BELIEVES I WANT TO SEE OR SHOULD I BE SEEING WHATEVER COMES UP NATURALLY BECAUSE MAYBE IT'S HEALTHY THAT I GET. A DOSE OF THE OTHER SIDE NOT JUST ONLY ONE SIDE OF THINGS SO -- I THINK THAT HAVING SOME TYPE OF REGULATION -- LEAST WITH NO IN TERMS OF WHAT'S PROPOSED -- IN YOUR BILL ALONG WITH A COUPLE THE OTHER BILLS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED -- IS IMPORTANT SO I'M GONNA MOVE YOUR BILL AND I WANNA THANK YOU FOR WORKING IN THE SPACE I APPRECIATE THAT IT JUST COMMENT I MEAN THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE A CHIEF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. ME WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR TALK ABOUT ALGORITHMS AND JUST HOW THAT WORKS I MEAN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S AND FOR INSTANCE RIGHT AND HOW THAT'S CHANGING -- SEARCH AND SEARCH ENGINES WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER COMPANIES THAT YOU LISTED LIKE FACEBOOK AND SOME OF THE OTHERS THAT I'VE DELVED INTO I AM. A HIGH. I MEAN WE SHOULD ALL BE ALARMED WHEN A I WAS TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND REINVENTING THE LANGUAGE. AND KEEPING US OUT AS HUMANS. UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANT I MEAN WE NEED TO HAVE SOME PARAMETERS SOME FRAMEWORK SOME GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING. TO HELP GUIDE THAT DISCUSSION ESPECIALLY WITH THAT AND APPRECIATE THE MOTION. THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER SALAS THANK YOU. FOR OFFERING THE BILL AND PROUD TO SUPPORT IT TODAY THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE DOING GOOD WORK HERE -- JUST HAD ONE KIND OF CAUTION AND AS YOU KNOW I'M I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN A I BUT I DID RESEARCH ON A AYE IN GRADUATE SCHOOL. I'VE CODED. YEAH I SYSTEMS. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE IN YOUR BILL OUR OUR FINAL BAFFLING LIKE -- THERE'S THERE'S A PHRASE HERE ONE OF THE THE BULLET POINTS IS THAT A AYE SYSTEM SHOULD BE DESIGNED. AND OPERATED IS TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH CULTURAL DIVERSITY. AND I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THAT BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU MEAN. FROM A TECHNICAL STANDPOINT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN WE HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT A AYE TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT A AYE ISN'T WHAT IT IS NOT BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION OUT THERE -- I THINK THAT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THINK THE A I HAVE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO SOMETHING THAT THEY SAW ON THE JETSONS. RIGHT AND THE REALITY IS THE A. I. AS MUCH MORE SUBTLE THAN THAT. AND SO I I JUST THINK IT'S IT'S A VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OF YOU KNOW STUDYING THIS ISSUE FURTHER BUT I'M NOT SUPPORTIVE OF DOING OF MAKING STATEMENTS THAT. THAT ARE GONNA COULD FOR FURTHER CONFUSE PEOPLE CORRECT YEAH NOW AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS JUST TRY TO HAVE SOME GUIDING PRINCIPLES THAT -- LIVID TO SOCIETAL NORMS. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY MUCH BETTER WAY OF PUTTING IT -- I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU JUST SAID -- BUT ANYWAY PLEASE PLEASE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY THANKS FOR BRINGING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH -- I YOU KNOW I'M VERY EXCITED BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I'M SEEING A LOT OF IT A BILLS ON A I'D ONLY FROM THE ASSEMBLY BUT ALSO FROM THE SENATE SIDE. SO -- MY YOU KNOW THE REASON I'M SO EXCITED BECAUSE WE WANT CALIFORNIA TO BE YOU KNOW RIGHT UP THERE -- IF NOT AHEAD OF THE CURVE AT LEAST TO YOU KNOW BE A PART OF THE CURVE SO -- SO I YUP DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE SOME OVERLAP BETWEEN YOUR BILL AND SOME OF THE I'LL BILLS OUT THERE. AND MIGHT MY INCLINATION IS TO SEE THE BILL GO FORWARD. A BECAUSE THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST COMMITTEE THE BILL AS AN SO I WANT TO SEE. THE BILL MORE FOR TODAY WE COULD DO SOME RECONCILIATION AND FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD ONCE WE HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE SENATE BILLS ALSO TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE WHAT THEY WHAT THEY DO. ON SO BUT I DO YOU KNOW ALL ONE YOUR COMMITMENT TO YOU KNOW BASICALLY AGREED TO WORK WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS GOING FORWARD. AT SOME POINT WE NEED TO ALL KIND OF SIT DOWN AND KIND OF MAP OUT SOME YOU KNOW. GET ALL THE CONFLICT OUT OF THE THE DIFFERENT BILLS I KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR BILL HOUSE -- SOME FEATURES SAID TO DO OVERLAP WITH OTHER EXISTING GOES BUT THE THERE ARE OTHERS FOR EXAMPLE THAT. THE CHIEF FOR A AYE OFFICER IS WHICH IS VERY UNIQUE -- SO ON SO WE CAN ALL SIT DOWN AT SOME POINT TO YOU KNOW SORT IT ALL OUT SO. AS LONG AS I HAVE YOUR COMMITMENT I'M I'M VERY COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THE BILL. MORE THAN HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT LIKE THIS SAID THERE'S SEVERAL BILLS AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THERE'S SOME ASPECTS OF THIS BILL THAT ARE NOT ANOTHER SALES AND SO IF WE CAN ALL COME TOGETHER. DO THE RIGHT THING I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO THE ABSOLUTE ONE OF WHICH IS THE DEFINITION OF A AYE WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT TO INCLUDE THE DEFINITION OF A AYE IN ANY OF THE BILL SO. THAT'S BEEN POINTED OUT IN THE ANALYSIS ALSO SO WITHOUT THE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE APPRECIATED I'VE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION. VERY GOOD DUBBED BILLS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED THE BILL WILL GO TO ASSEMBLY LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT NEXT -- SO WITHOUT THE MAN SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. OUT HI SO I KILEY.

THE CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION REFER TO THE REPORT AS A CALL TO ACTION -- THAT'S ONE REASON I'VE INTRODUCED AB FOR FIFTY NINE WHICH PASSED THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND STATE SERVICES COMMISSION WITH CREATING A SET OF GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS FOR THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT. CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED ITSELF AS A LEADER IN A POLICY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED MY RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE ASYLUM ARE A I PRINCIPLES. A SET OF GUIDELINES FOR THE SAFE AND BENEFICIAL DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF A AYE. THAT RESOLUTION ACR TO FIFTEEN WAS ONLY THE FIRST STEP IN ACKNOWLEDGING THE IMPORTANCE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITHIN SOCIETY AND OUR ROLE AS STATE LAWMAKERS. AB FOR FIFTY NINE BILLS ON THAT RESOLUTION BY ENSURING THAT FUTURE USES OF A AYE TOOLS WITH IN CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT OR MANAGE THEM AMENDED IN A FAIR SECURE ETHICAL AND BENEFICIAL MANNER.
