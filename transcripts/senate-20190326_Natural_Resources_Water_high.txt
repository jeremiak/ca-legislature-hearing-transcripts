BEFORE WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM SINCE WE DON'T HAVE ONE I FIGURED WE GET STARTED WITH THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING COMPONENTS A WELCOME THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES IN WATER. WE'RE GONNA START THIS MORNING WITH A A BRIEF INFORMATIONAL. NOTE FROM ROSS BROWN AT THE LA -- YOU TALK ABOUT FINANCING FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY. AND THAT SORT OF LEAD UP TO OUR FIRST ITEM TODAY OF THE AGENDA SB. FORTY FIVE I DON'T KNOW IF LA -- IS IN THE HOUSE YES WELCOME -- AND THE YEAH LET'S LET'S GET STARTED -- WELCOME I THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR SENATORS MY NAME'S JACKIE BRIAN BROWN RUSSIA IN MY COLLEAGUES YEAH ROSSI LE FROST AT ALL OKAY -- I WANT TO HOG ALL THE GLORY TODAY PLEASE DO -- AGAIN MY NAME'S BRIAN BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I'VE BEEN ASKED TO COME IN AND DO A SHORT PRESENTATION FOR THE COMMITTEE. COULD PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT THE DELIBERATE FOR SB -- FORTY FIVE BASED ON THE REQUEST THE HANDOUT THAT WE PREPARE WICH I BELIEVE ALL THE MEMBERS ALREADY HAVE THERE ARE SOME. ADDITIONAL COPIES FOR THE PUBLIC AND IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE AS WELL BUT REALLY THE HANDOUT CONSIST OF OF THREE PARTS ONE ALL TALK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT. WHAT THE CLIMATE SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC AND FISCAL AFFECTS? IN THE STATE -- SECOND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT JUST GENERALLY ABOUT HOW STATE BONDS WORK -- WHAT THE COSTS ARE TO THE STATE AS WELL MAKE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT -- SORT OF SOME TYPICAL LA -- COMMENTS ABOUT -- GOOD BOND PRACTICES AND ORPHALI WE HELPFUL AND THEN LASTLY PER YOUR REQUEST -- ALL BE TO SPENDING A FEW MINUTES TALKING ABOUT WHAT ARE OTHER ALTERNATIVE FUNDING MECHANISM STATE LOCAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN USE THE FINANCE CLIMB OUT CLIMATE ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES. ON BEFORE I BEGIN I SHOULD JUST PREFACE THIS WITH A NOTE THAT OUR OFFICE DOES NOT TAKE A POSITION ON BILLS SO MY COMMENTS ARE MEANT TO BE. CONTACT BACKGROUND INFORMATION AS YOU DELIBERATE SB FORTY FIVE BUT WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL ITSELF. ALL RIGHT THAT WITH THAT IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND OUT. AN ISSUE I'M SURE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE ALREADY VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT WHAT IS THE CLIENT CLIMATE. SCIENCE TELLING US ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE FIRST TWO PAGES A RANGE OF A FAX I'M GOING TO EACH ONE BUT WE EXPECT TO SEE SEA LEVEL RISE ALONG THE COAST. INLAND FLOODING. INCREASES IN TEMPERATURE BOTH OVERALL AVERAGE TEMPERATURES AS WELL AS HIGH HEAT EVENTS. WE EXPECT TO SEE MORE AND MORE SEVERE DROUGHTS IN THE FUTURE. THE CLIMATE SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US THAT WE SHOULD SEE MORE AND MORE SEVERE WILD FIRES IN THE STATE. AND ALSO WARMING MORE ACIDIC OCEANS -- IMPORTANTLY EACH ONE OF THOSE THE FAX. COULD BE DRAMATIC FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL REGION IN THE STATE -- BUT IMPORTANTLY IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE WE TO EXPECT EVERY REGION TO IN ALL LIKELIHOOD TO EXPERIENCE ONE IF NOT MORE THAN ONE OF THOSE A FAX -- INNING CONSEQUENTLY WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE BASED ON THE CLIMATE SCIENCE IS TELLING US. THAT THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR THINGS LIKE PUBLIC HEALTH THE HIGH HEAT EVENT FOR EXAMPLE COULD HAVE. SIGNIFICANT BANKS ON AS ASTHMA RATES AND AND INCREASED MORTALITY. YOU COULD SEE A REDUCE WATER SUPPLY BECAUSE OF DROUGHT. REDUCE WATER SUPPLY FOR IRRIGATION IN OUR AGRICULTURAL REGIONS. YOU COULD SEE PUBLIC SAFETY IMPACT BECAUSE OF EVENTS LIKE FLOODING IN WILD FIRES. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF THE HAND NOW -- SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WERE SOMETIMES ASK AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE ECONOMIC AND FISCAL A FAX. OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES IN THE FUTURE IN IN THE SHORT ANSWER WE DON'T KNOW A LOT YET -- THERE ARE THERE IS SOME RESEARCH OUT THEN WE TRY TO SUMMARIZE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT HERE IN THE HAND OUT. BUT WITH REGARD TO LONGER TERM ECONOMIC IMPACT PROBABLY THE BEST STUDY THAT WE'VE COME ACROSS SO FAR. DONE BY A GROUP OF RESEARCHERS AND INCLUDING SOME FROM OUR OWN UC BERKELEY. AND THEY LOOK NATION WIDE AT CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD THAT AFFECT ON GDP BE. IN DIFFERENT AREAS BASED ON WHAT THE THE FACTS WOULD BE -- BASED ON THEIR RESEARCH THEY WOULD AS WE WOULD SORT OF PUT ON THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOST CDP IN CALIFORNIA ON AN ANNUAL BASIS -- OUT IN -- TWENTY ONE HUNDRED TAKE THAT WITH -- AS SORT OF AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE THERE'S A CERTAINLY A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND THAT IN THE AUTHOR'S NOTE TO THAT ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF THEIR STUDY IS THEY COULD LOOK AT THE FULL RANGE OF IMPACTS OF OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO THIS PARTICULAR IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA BECAUSE A COUPLE. OF PIECES THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO INCLUDE WERE THE EFFECTS OF WILD FIRE WHICH WE KNOW CALIFORNIA COURSE HAS VERY SEVERE RISKS. AS WELL AS SEALEVEL RISE THEY LOOK AT SEA LEVEL RISE THAT SPECIFICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH HURRICANES -- I THINK THE THAT WE EXPECT THE AFFECTION CALIFORNIA SEA LEVEL RISE TO BE SIGNIFICANT BUT NOT SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO HURRICANES. AND SO JUST -- ADDED HERE JUST VERY RECENTLY LAST COUPLE WEEKS THE USGS. LOOK AT WHAT ALONG THE CALIFORNIA COAST IS ESTIMATED THE PROPERTY VALUE AT RISK FROM EVEN MODERATE SEA LEVEL RISE OVER THE NEXT EIGHTY YEARS AND THEY PUT IT AT A HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS. OF VALUE -- ISN'T. BUT NO THAT'S NOT THE AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD ANTICIPATE BEING LOST NECESSARILY BUT THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF RISK AND AGAIN TO GIVE YOU. AT LEAST A POINT. ON ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF POTENTIAL RISK. BUT THAT'S THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS SOMETIMES WHAT WERE ASKED WHAT WHAT'S THE RISK TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHAT TO OUR FINANCES. AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THIS -- WE'VE DONE SOME LOOKING AND AND WE WERE ABLE TO COME ACROSS GOOD INFORMATION ON THAT. THAT SAID WE DO KNOW THAT THE TYPES OF IMPACTS WE'VE SORTOF CATEGORIZED. IN THREE WAYS FIRST OF ALL YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GONNA HAVE INCREASED THE COST TO RESPOND TO DISASTERS LIKE FLOODS. AND WILDFIRES. TO THE EXTENT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUE THEN HAS THE THE FACTS THAT ARE PROJECTED YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE INCREASED COSTS FOR DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. JUST TO GIVE YOU ONE POINT OF OF REFERENCE THE CAMPFIRE THIS LAST YEAR THE STATE. IS BUDGETING THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR RESPONSE AND RECOVERY COSTS JUST FOR THAT ONE EVENT ALONE. WORTH NOTING OF COURSE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL REIMBURSE US FOR A LARGE SHARE THAT COST BUT GIVE YOU AGAIN IT'S NOT AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE FROM AS A SINGLE EVENT. WE ALSO EXPECT TO SEE ANNUAL OPERATING COSTS GO UP IN THE FUTURE FOR STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FOR PREVENTIVE ACTIVITIES SUCH AS WELFARE PREVENTION OR FLOOD MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES -- THAT MIGHT MEAN NEED TO BE DONE ON A ROUTINE BASIS COULD SEE INCREASE IN ENERGY COSTS AND OTHER ONGOING OPERATING COSTS. AND LASTLY WE MIGHT EXPECT TO SEE ONE TIME OUT LAYS FROM STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HARDEN FACILITIES OR IN SOME CASES RELOCATE FACILITIES IN ORDER TO TAKE THEM OUT OF THE DANGER ZONE. YOU KNOW FROM SEA LEVEL RISE OR WILD FIRES OR OTHER POTENTIAL -- RISKY AREAS -- IF YOU TURN THE PAGE FOR A MINUTE CHANGE GEARS AND TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT STATE BONDS. THE STATE. CAN I TAKE PAYS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN TWO WAYS WE DO SOME ON A PAY AS YOU GO BASIS WE DON'T DO A LOT OF THAT WITH THE GENERAL FUND THAT'S FAIRLY LIMITED HISTORICALLY. WHAT WE DO ISSUE BONDS AND -- WE HAVE TO TYPE THE BOND IN THE STATE GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS OF THE ONE TO HAVE TO GO TO VOTERS STATE WIDE VOTERS WE ALSO HAVE SOME USE OF LEASE REVENUE BONDS. BONDS YOU CAN THINK OF IS JUST A WAY TO BORROW MONEY ITS. WE ISSUE THE BONDS PRIVATE INVESTORS PROVIDE US MONEY WE USE THAT MONEY TO PAY FOR PROJECTS AND THEN WE HAVE TO REPAY THOSE INVESTORS OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS OFTENTIMES TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS. FOR INFRASTRUCTURE BONDS. MUCH LIKE THE WAY WE PAY FOR OUR HOUSE WITH AND PAY FOR MORTGAGE FOR A HOUSE WE BORROWED HAVE TO PAY IT BACK WITH INTEREST OVER TIME. WE DO THIS SO FOR A COUPLE OF OF GOOD REASONS -- WE KNOW THE OFTENTIMES THESE LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PAY FOR ON A PAGE YOU GO BASIS BECAUSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF COSTS -- AGAIN PARTICULAR LARGE PROJECTS. AND ALSO THERE'S SOME. VALUE IN THESE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE A LONGER LIFESPAN FOR TAXPAYERS OF FEE PAYERS NOT ONLY TODAY BUT THOSE IN THE FUTURE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF THOSE PROJECTS BECAUSE THEY'LL BENEFIT FROM THEM AS WELL -- WHICH SOMETIMES ASK WHAT WAS THE COST OF FINANCING WITH THE BOND -- IN NOMINAL DOLLARS IT'S USUALLY WE ULTIMATELY WILL PAY WITH THOSE INTEREST COST ABOUT TWO DOLLARS FOR EVERY DOLLAR IN BOND ISSUANCE. BUT WHEN WE COUNT FOR THE FACT THAT WE PAY THOSE COSTS OFF OVER TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR PERIOD WHEN YOU COUNT FOR INFLATION IT TEND TO BE MORE LIKE A DOLLAR AND THIRTY CENTS AN ACTUAL REAL DOLLARS THAT WE'RE SPENDING. FOR EACH DOLLAR ISSUED SO THERE ARE INCREASE COSTS BUT SOMETIMES THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ABOUT JUST WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE SO FOR THAT SO FULL. YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE JUST THIS JUST SUMMARIZE IT FOR YOU THE A NATURAL RESOURCES RELATED BONDS AND BEEN ISSUED OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES. THE TOTAL ABOUT THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN. TOTAL BOND AUTHORITY. MOST OF THIS MONEY HAS ALREADY BEEN COMMITTED TO PROJECTS AND SPENT PROBABLY THE TWO EXCEPTIONS OR THE LAST. TWO PROPOSITION ONE WHICH IS THE FAMILIAR WATER RELATED BOND PASSED IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN NOT ALL THAT MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT% YET -- BUT MOST OF IT HAD BEEN COMMITTED TO TO PROJECTS SO THERE ARE PROJECTS UNDER WAY AND PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES. AND WITH PROP PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT WITH PAST LESS THAN A YEAR AGO BUT ALREADY BETWEEN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET AND WITH PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR FOR THE BUDGET YEAR IF APPROVED BY YOU ALSO THAT WILL HAVE AUTHORIZED OR APPROPRIATED. ABOUT HALF OF THE TOTAL FOR BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS AUTHORIZED HIM OUT BONTA THAT ONE IS ALSO WELL ANYWAY. AND IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT STATE INDEBTEDNESS. THE FIGURE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE SHOWS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES WHAT SHARE. OF STATE GENERAL FUND REVENUES ARE SPENT ON PAYING OFF OUR GENERAL FUND BOND MOSTLY GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND AGAIN. AND YOU CAN SEE RIGHT NOW WE'RE TO A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN 5% OF OUR OVERALL GENERAL FUND IS SPENT FOR THAT PURPOSE -- AND YOU CAN SEE THAT FALLS KIND OF IN A RANGE A NORMAL RANGE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES. THIS VARIATION USING THE FIGURE IS NOT REALLY DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY CHANGES IN HOW MUCH BOND ISSUE IT ISSUED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS MUCH AS IS AFFECTED BY. GENERAL FUND REVENUES IN THE VOLATILITY OF OUR REVENUE STREAM IN THE STATE AND SO IS. GENERAL FUND REVENUES GO UP ARE THE PERCENTAGE SPENT ON BOND ISSUANCES DECLINES AND AND VICE VERSA -- I KNOW THAT A ROUGHLY ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IT'S BEEN OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND TO PAY OFF RESOURCES RELATED BONDS. THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ISSUED. ON PAGE -- SEVEN THESE ARE A COUPLE OF CONSIDERATIONS WHEN DESIGNING BONDS THESE COME FROM VARIOUS DOCUMENTS OUR OFFICE IS PRODUCED. IN PRIOR YEARS RELATED TO TO VERY SMALL AND MEASURES. FIRST WE JUST HIGHLIGHTED THERE'S REALLY NO RIGHT LEVEL OF SPENDING ON INFRASTRUCTURE OR BOND AT IT. LIKE EVERY OTHER BUDGET PROGRAM YOU HAVE IT'S REALLY A FOR REFLECTION OF HOW. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FALLS WITHIN YOUR PRIORITIES FOR GENERAL FUND SPENDING BECAUSE OF COURSE EVERY DOLLAR THAT YOU SPEND ON INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PROGRAMS -- ONE THING THAT MAKES SPENDING ON BOND A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE OF COURSE IS THAT. BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING THAT TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR COMMITMENT TO PAY OFF THOSE BONDS YOU'RE NOT JUST MAKING A ONE YEAR COMMITMENT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE YOU ARE YOU SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT. THOSE COSTS ARE GONNA BE IN THE BUDGET. AND THEREFORE NOT AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES FOR A LONGER PERIOD THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S NOT WORTH DOING BUT YOU JUST WANNA RECOGNIZE THAT AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOUR LONGER TERM. PRIORITIES. ON THE SECOND. WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE THESE BONDS ARE PAID OFF OVER LONG PERIODS IMPORTANT WE THINK. TO A TARGET BONDS TO PROJECT THAT WILL HAVE A LONGER LIFESPAN WE GENERALLY DO NOT RECOMMEND FUNDING SHORT TERM PROJECTS OR OR ANNUAL OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE TYPES COST FOR THE MOST PART. FROM ONE CONSIDERATION YOU'LL ALSO HAVE IS HOW MUCH OF A YOUR BOND SHOULD BE SPENT ON STATE VERSUS LOCAL PROJECTS THERE'S NO RIGHT OR WRONG SPLIT TO THIS BUT CERTAINLY IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE STATE TO USE BOND FOR STATE PROJECTS EITHER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE OWN AND OPERATE. TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS -- SOMETIMES A LITTLE MORE DEBATE ABOUT HOW THEY SHOULD BE HOW MUCH OF BOND SHOULD BE TARGETED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE LOCAL PROJECTS -- HISTORICALLY AS A STAY AREN'T RESOURCES BONDS HAVE PROVIDED FUNDING FOR LOCAL PROJECT SOMETIMES TARGETED TOWARDS COMMUNITIES OTHERWISE DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT. RESOURCES TO PAY FOR PROJECTS ON THEIR OWN. OR JUST OTHER HIGH PRIORITY NEEDS OR SOMETIMES REGIONAL PROJECTS -- PROJECTS WHERE THERE MAY NOT BE LOCAL INCENTIVE. FOR LOCAL COLLABORATION SOMETIMES WE CAN USE OUR BOND FUNDS OR OTHER REVENUE STREAMS TO HELP. ENCOURAGE THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY. YOU ALSO WHEN I THINK ABOUT HOW YOU DISTRIBUTE THE BOND WITH THE ONE YOU THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS OR FORMULA. PROSELYTE THAT MAY JUST DEPEND ON EACH INDIVIDUAL BOND PROGRAM WHAT. WELL WHAT YOU WANT ENCOURAGE WHETHER CERTAIN SPECIFIC GOALS THAT YOU WANT TO TRY TO ACHIEVE IN WHICH CASE MAYBE COMPETITIVE PROCESS IS. MORE VALUABLE OR IF YOU REALLY ARE YOUR GOAL IS TO SPREAD -- CERTAIN FINDING EQUALLY ACROSS THE STATE AND YOU MIGHT USE A FORMULA -- WE ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT. OF PRETTY GOOD FOR PROJECTS TO GO TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE LOCAL NONPROFITS THAT THEY HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE TO MAINTAIN THAT INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE LONGER TERM FOR THAT THEY DON'T. BECOME DILAPIDATED -- BEFORE THEIR USEFUL LIFE SHOULD AND AND LASTLY RESOURCES BONDS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE. INCLUDED PROVISIONS REQUIRING ACCOUNTABILITY AND REPORTING OF PROJECT WE THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. TO ENSURE THAT. YOU KNOW AND CAN DO YOUR OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT PROJECTS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED HOW THEY'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTED ON WHAT TIME FRAME IT ALSO PROVIDES INFORMATION FOR FUTURE? DELIBERATIONS FOR FUTURE BOND YOU CAN LOOK BACK AND SEE WHAT WHAT DID. THAT BOND ACCOMPLISH DO WE NEED TO MAYBE MAKE ANY CHANGES IN TO A FUTURE BOND BASED ON LESSONS LEARNED. FROM WHAT'S REPORTED HERE. THERE'S A JUST GENERAL GENERAL KNOW SOMEONE IN GENERAL LAST LAST TWO PAGES DAM PAGE EIGHT I'M. HERE WE WERE ASKED WHAT OTHER. REVENUE SOURCES ARE FUNDING SOURCES COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE. FOR CLIMB ADAPTATION JACK'S. WE KIND OF CATEGORIZES INTO A YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR EXISTING REVENUES THAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE DIFFERENT POTS AND AND THE FORTIES. AND THEN OF COURSE YOU ARE A YOU AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE AUTHORITY O RAISE NEW REVENUES. THE FIRST WITH RESPECT TO EXISTING REVENUE SOURCES -- I THINK THE KEY THING HERE AGAIN IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT. YOU YOU CAN USE ALMOST ANY OF THESE BUT TO EXTENT THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY COST TO TO EXTEND TO YOU THAT FOR ONE PURPOSE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR FOR ANOTHER FOR ANOTHER. BUDGET PRIORITY BUT CERTAINLY STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE pGENERAL FUND THERE ARE MANY SPECIAL FUNDS THAT CAN BE USED FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE IS YOU THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FIND ON A LIMITED BASIS. FOR ADAPTATION SPECIFIC RELATED PROJECTS -- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR EXAMPLE COULD HAVE SOME FEES WHILE WATER RELATED FEEDER FLOOD PROTECTION FEE THAT COULD BE USED FOR PROJECTS THAT COULD HELP. CLIMATE CHANGE RISK FOR EXAMPLE. LOCAL. IN ADDITION TO STATE THE LOCALS ALSO HAVE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE BONDS. IN ONE SPECIFIC BOND AUTHORITY IS THE ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICT THIS I. AN AUTHORITY THAT WAS GRANTED BY THE LEGISLATURE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO IN THE AFTERMATH OF A DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT. IN THIS ALLOWS CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS TO USED PROPERTY TAX INCREMENTS OF THE GROWTH IN PROPERTY TAX REVENUES. TO PAY OFF BOND ISSUANCES -- IN ONE OF THE EXPLICIT ALLOWABLE USES IN THE CODE IS TO YOU TO FINANCE CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROJECTS THAT WE COULD BE AN ALLOWABLE USE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IN LESS THAN ONE HIGHLIGHTED THE STATE DOES IN IN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT IS WELL RECEIVED FEDERAL FUNDING IT'S RELATIVELY SMALL FOR THE MOST PART. OFTEN FOR PLANNING AND RESEARCH TYPE ACTIVITIES AND SOMETIMES SMALLER SCALE -- ADAPTATION TYPE PROJECT BUT I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU -- THE HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR BUDGET ANALYSIS THIS HERE. THIS IS FUNDING THAT COMES TO STATE IN THE AFTERMATH FROM FEMA IN THE AFTERMATH OF LARGE DISASTERS AND BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S HAVE THE VERY LARGE WILDFIRE DISASTERS THE LAST FEW YEARS. WE'RE ANTICIPATING THE STATE WILL RECEIVE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS FUNDING OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO -- WE HIGHLIGHT IN OUR BUDGET IS TO MAKE YOU AWARE -- YES. MANAGE THAT PROGRAM AND THEY SET CRITERIA FOR WHAT PROJECT WILL BE -- FOR WILL BE FUNDED AND CERTAIN CLIMATE ADAPTATION TYPE OF ACTIVITIES ARE ALLOWABLE USES OF THOSE FUNDS WE'VE RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE THAT YOU REVIEW OF YESES PLANS INTO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE. IN SOME CASES DIFFER FROM YOURS THAT PROVIDING SOME ADDITIONAL DIRECTION ON HOW TO HOW TO DIRECT THOSE FUNDS. LASTLY ON PAGE -- NINE AGAIN IS THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE CERTAINLY AWARE STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE AUTHORITY TO RAISE REVENUES -- THAT CAN BE BROAD BASED TAX INCREASES THE INCREASES CHARGED ON POLLUTERS. EACH ONE OF THESE -- DOES COME WITH THE CONCERT AND CONSTRAINTS AGAIN AS I'M SURE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE WELL AWARE -- BUT WHETHER THOSE BE DIFFERENT VOTING THRESHOLD OR REQUIREMENT FOR PROPERTY TAX. I'M SORRY PROPERTY OWNERS TO TO VOTE ON CERTAIN FEES ARE ASSESSMENTS -- WE JUST HIGHLIGHT HERE THAT -- THESE ARE AVENUES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND COULD BE USED FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROJECT BUT AGAIN THERE ARE CERTAIN CONSTRAINTS ON THOSE WHETHER THOSE BE LIMITATIONS LIKE I'M PROP THIRTEEN FROM PROP THIRTEEN ON THE MATTER PROPERTY TAX REVENUE LOCALS COULD YOU. CAN CAN REYES -- OR OTHER VOTING. RESTRICTIONS OR CONSTRAINTS. SO I THINK THAT REALLY CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND HAPPY TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU -- THE CONCISE BUT VERY USEFUL TESTIMONY -- I I JUST TO START OVER THE ONE IN. LINE OF QUESTIONS JUST IN TERMS OF THE THE MATH AROUND COST EFFECTIVENESS OF ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE [inaudible] AND WE WE ROLLED BY THE NUMBER BUT IT'S A REALLY BIG. ONE WE'RE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TENS OF BILLIONS [inaudible] AND SOME OTHER UNKNOWN UPPER BOUND -- I'M REALLY HOPING OUR FIFTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT IN THE STATE STARTS. TO DRILL DOWN ON THE TRUE FISCAL RISK BUT I GUESS I WAS WONDERING THE IT'S ABOUT A BUCK THIRTY FOR EACH DOLLAR PART OF THESE BONDS THIS IS SORT OF ROUGH WORKING MATH. BUT IF THE COST OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS A A TRILLION DOLLARS BY THE END OF THE CENTURY I'M. HOW DOES THAT AFFECT? THEY ARE MATH WE MAKE EVEN JUST CERTAIN PRESUMPTIONS IN THE LIFE OF THE BOND STATE YOU KNOW TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR BASIS -- HOW DOES THAT SORT OF AVOIDED COST AFFECT? THAT MATH AROUND BUCK THIRTY PER DOLLAR. YEAH I MICHIGAN TO THE ATH IN MY HEAD BUT I THINK -- I THINK AND SEXUALLY IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION I I THINK YOU'RE ASKING A QUESTION WHICH IS. KEY CENTER WE MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS TODAY EVEN IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL. IN INFLATION OR I'M SORRY. INTEREST RELATED COSTS. COULD SPENDING THOSE DOLLARS TODAY REDUCE FUTURE COSTS AND AND AND THE MATH WORK OUT THAT THAT'S A BETTER INVESTMENT TODAY THAN THAN WAITING FOR THOSE DISASTERS OR FUTURE COSTS MATURE THAT AND I THINK CONCEPTUALLY THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT -- WE OFTENTIMES THINK ABOUT EVEN JUST IN OUR MAINTENANCE PROGRAM FOR STATE INFRASTRUCTURE WE'RE REGULATE ADVISING YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO PREVENTIVE ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE THAT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. IS NOT DAMAGE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. THERE ARE SO MANY EXAMPLES WHERE IF WE WAIT FOR A FACILITY TO BE DAMAGE THE COSTS ARE MUCH GREATER. TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THAT FACILITY AND TO DO THE WORK UP FRONT NOW I GET SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED BECAUSE THIS IS SOMEWHAT CONCEPTUAL WHAT. WHAT THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS WOULD BE RIGHT -- IF WE THINK ABOUT. SEA LEVEL RISE FOR EXAMPLE. THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT OR IN IN PROBABLY VERY FROM COMMUNITY COMMUNITY ABOUT WHAT THE RIGHT STRATEGY SHOULD BE BASED ON WHAT THEIR LOCAL RISKS ARE FROM SEA LEVEL RISE. AND WEATHER MAKES SENSE. FOR CERTAIN FOR CERTAIN PROJECT TO DO HARDENING TYPE PROJECTS OR TO DO PROJECTS. WHICH HAVE COME WITH ONE SET OF COST TO DO OTHER PROJECTS THAT MIGHT MAKE THEM IN SOME WAYS -- JUST MORE ABLE TO WITHSTAND. SEA LEVEL RISE TO MAYBE RAISING OF A BUILDING FOR EXAMPLE THAT COULD COME WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF COST WHICH IS ACTUALLY HAVING TO MOVE. THE SALIENT SO THERE'S BEEN TALK FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT. CERTAIN FREEWAYS ARE CERTAIN ROADS ACTUALLY HAVING TO BE REDIRECTED IN DIFFERENT PLACES BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF A ROTATION ALONG THE COAST. THAT COMES WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF COST AND SO IT TO DO THE MATH I THINK EARLIER IN SOME WAYS REQUIRES REALLY LOOKING AT THIS. SPECIFIC PROJECT A PROGRAM IN FIGURING OUT WHAT THOSE FUTURE COSTS WOULD WOULD BE BUT I THINK IN IN PRINCIPLE YES. INVESTING IN SOONER TO REDUCE RISK LOOK POTENTIALLY VERY LARGE AND EXPENSIVE RISK IN THE FUTURE CAN CAN MAKE SENSE SO IN THEORY THERE'S A WAY TO DESIGN. A RESOURCES TYPE ON THAT SAVE MONEY [inaudible] OVER TIME. I WOULD I WOULD THINK SO AGAIN I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST. OF COURSE THERE THIS COMES WITH A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY BUT BUT BUT CERTAINLY IN THEORY YEAH I THINK PUTTING MONEY IN TODAY CAN BE USED IF IT'S IF YOU'RE. IF SOME SOME THIS MAY COME TO TO HOW YOU THINK ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC BOND HOW YOU PRIORITIZE YOUR PROGRAM THE COST EFFECTIVENESS COULD BE ONE PRIORITY THAT YOU ABOUT HOW WHAT PROGRAMS YOU WANT TO INVEST IN. AS WELL AS WHAT SPECIFIC CRITERIA USED FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM. BUT EVEN IF YOU I MEAN. TO GET. BEYOND THEORY THOUGH IF YOU TAKE A TRILLION DOLLAR RISK AND YOU'RE BUYING DOWN TEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT RISK -- FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT RISK YOU STILL HAVE. A NINETY FIVE OR NINETY BILLION DOLLAR LIABILITY. I MEAN I I I I WOULD WE LOVE SOME INPUT I THINK JUST IN TERMS A LEVEL SETTING THE SCOPE OF INVESTMENT THAT WERE EVEN CONSIDERING HERE TODAY. STACKED UP AGAINST THE SCOPE OF THE RISK AND JUST ACKNOWLEDGING AT LEAST ON AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE BASIS THAT LIKE. EVEN IF THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR CLIMATE RESILIENCY BOND. THIS IS THE THE THE RISK OVER THAT SAME PERIOD TIME IS FAR GREATER -- AND SO WHAT YEAH IT'S JUST IT IT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP US JUST SORT OF LEVEL SET IN TERMS OF OUR PRIORITIES I THINK UNDER. IF IF WE WERE TO FALLOW FARMING IN ALL THE CENTRAL VALLEY BECAUSE THE DROUGHTS. AND ALL THE GROUND WATER DRIED UP AND YOU KNOW WE MAY SEE YOU KNOW THE COTTON YIELDS ARE DOWN STACK UP IN A SERIOUS WAY VERSUS SOME OTHER STRATEGY TO AVERT THAT SO IS THERE SOME WAY THAT YOU CAN. GET BACK TO US TO JUST WITH THEM. EVEN IF IT'S NOT A MY PERFECT MATH SOME WAY TO SORT OF SCOPE. A RISK BY DOWN STRATEGIES FOR OURSELVES YEAH I MEAN WE CERTAINLY CAN I CAN GO BACK AND WORK WITH OUR TEAM OF FOLKS AT THE OFFICE AND AND SEE IF THERE'S SOME WAY WE CAN PRESENT THAT -- THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO YOU WERE HAPPY TO DO THAT -- I I GUESS MAYBE JUST I WOULD ADD AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS. THINKING BOTH ABOUT ERROR OR BEING CLEAR FOR YOURSELF ABOUT IT WHAT RISKY BY NOW WE'RE BRINGING. WE TAKE THAT WE WANT TO BUY DOWN OVERALL ECONOMIC RISK -- VERSES WHAT IS THE RISK TO THE STATE FINANCES SPECIFICALLY THOSE ARE -- I THINK BOTH IMPORTANT QUESTION BUT THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT DISTINCT. AND THEN AGAIN GOING BACK TO POINT A I ALLUDED TO EARLIER THINKING ABOUT. SIX AND THAT SOME OF THESE RISKS -- ARE TO LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE OR PRIVATE PROPERTY TO WHAT EXTENT IS THAT DO YOU WANT THAT TO BE THE STATE -- PAIN FOR TO BUY DOWN THAT RISK VERSES COULD THAT BE LOOK THERE SHOULD BE A LOCAL BUY IN FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR SHOULD THAT BE. AN INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS TYPE OF RESPONSIBILITY. THANK YOU COMMENTS QUESTIONS YES CEREMONY. COME OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. ALEJO'S OFFICER PRECIADO. THE FRAMING AND PRESENTATION. SO WHAT KIND OF PICKING UP ON THE CHAIR LEANS IN YOUR PROJECTION ON ESTIMATED PROPERTY VALUE AT RISK A HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION. BASED ON MY TO SEA LEVEL RISE. PROJECTED TO KERR BY. TWENTY ONE HUNDRED SO THAT'S ONE ESTIMATED. LIABILITY OF THAT HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION. ARM. HOW DO YOU ADDRESS IT? WHAT PERCENTAGE MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR SOME FEDERAL SUPPORT VERSES. DRAG ON THE GENERAL FUND VERSUS BOND FUNDING IN. IN. JUST TAKE ONE FIGURE LIKE THAT IN MAY BE BREAK OUT A LITTLE LATER THE PATHWAYS. IN IN YEARS TO PAY THAT OFF. I'M ANOTHER QUESTION I HAD ON PAGE SIX WHERE -- WE'VE REDUCE SOME. TO BELOW 5% THE ANNUAL INTEREST RATE WE'RE PAYING ON OUR OUR OBLIGATIONS. AND YOU INDICATED THAT THAT FIGURES AFFECTED SOMEWHAT BY OUR GENERAL REVENUES. DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF HOW THAT COMPARES TO OTHER STATES YOU SAID THERE'S NOT REALLY ARE A CORRECT TARGET DATE. WE'RE JUST CALIFORNIA SIT FOR EXAMPLE WITH OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS VERSES OTHER STATES OF SIMILAR SIZE. YEAH I AM ALL HAVE TO GO BACK AND DOUBLE CHECK OF LOOKED AT THOSE NUMBERS BUT NOT VERY RECENTLY MY GENERAL RECOLLECTION IS WE'RE KIND OF IN THE NORMAL RANGE ONE ON OUT LIAR BUT I CAN GO BACK AND AND GIVE YOU MORE PRECISE. INFORMATION AND IT SEEMS LIKE ONE ONE FUNCTION OF THAT PERCENT IS. OUR OUR REVENUES. FROM. WE'VE ALSO XCELERATED. INTEREST PAYMENTS IN SOME RECENT BUDGET SAYS THAT CRACKED HIS AT BEEN ON BOND AT SERVICERS THAT JUST BEEN HONOR. PENSION LIABILITIES. I'M SO OUR INTEREST RATES ARE ARE NOT SET BY THE BY THE STATE ITS IT'S DETERMINED BY THE MARKETS IN FRANK. IN SO -- BUT WE CAN STILL LOOK CELERY ARE. INTEREST PAYMENTS HONEST YES THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE IS AGENCY INVOLVED WITH MANAGING OUR OUR BOND DAY IN SO THEY WILL THEY'LL THEY'LL -- ON A ROUTINE BASIS RE ISSUE BOND IN SOME CASES ARE LIKE -- PROBABLY IN SOME CASES PREPAY BOND DEPENDING ON THEIR CALCULATION OF HOW THAT WILL YIELD THE BEST RETURN FOR THE STATE OR THE LOWEST COST OVER OVER THE LONG RUN INSIGHT I THEY ACTIVELY MANAGE. THAT PORTFOLIO. CAN I WOULD BE CURIOUS JUST TO SEE AGAIN I REALIZE SETS. CERTAINLY FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT. 5% IS NOT AN ALARMING. FIGURE THAT'S WITHIN THE BALLPARK OF REASONABLE. YEAH I I BELIEVE IT IS BUT I'LL DEFINITELY GET BACK TO YOU WITH THE SPECIFICS THANK YOU WE RANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATE CAREER. NOT SURE HAVE A QUESTION HERE BUT BUT I AM. WHAT WHAT MAY MAKE SENSE? AS WE GET INTO FUTURE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE RISKS. FROM DIFFERENT. ACTIVITIES WHETHER IT'S FIRE ACTIVITY WHETHER IT'S C. RISE WHETHER IT'S DROUGHT -- THAT WE MAY WANT TO ASK -- OUR EXPERTS TO COME IN AND DO A PANEL ON WHAT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE IMPACTS AND SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE -- BUT I I A IT'S A WORD OF CAUTION BECAUSE WE HAD SOME MODELING DONE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO [inaudible] BACK IN. EIGHT AND NINE THAT SHOWED THAT IF WE HAD A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE. IN THE DELTA. ANYWHERE ABOVE SIX POINT. TWO THAT THE REPERCUSSIONS WERE SUCH THAT WE MIGHT LOSE. THE SOURCE OF WATER. BECAUSE OF THE THE MIXTURE OF SALT AND FRESHWATER. ANY IMPACT TWO THIRDS OF THE STATE'S. POPULATION BY THAT AND FRANKLY I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THAT TELLS US THAT WE STARTED TO TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THAT. SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS. THROUGH THE BONDS THAT WE'VE PASSED THAT WOULD PROVIDE US WITH A DEGREE OF CERTAINTY THAT THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN THAT THERE WERE THERE BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME SOLUTIONS. BUYING BUYING PROPERTY CREATING STORAGE AND ALL THAT KIND OF GOOD STUFF SO SO I JUST THINK THAT THE MORE THE MORE INFORMATION WE HAVE THE BETTER. OFF WILL BE BUT I ALSO THINK AS A NOTE OF CAUTION THAT WE HAVE TO TIE. THE THE SOLUTIONS TO THE BONDS. SO THAT IN A VERY DELIBERATE WAY WE DON'T USE THEM FOR OTHER THINGS BASED ON KIND OF THE THE WHATEVER IS HAPPENING AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME SO I I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION WHICH IS -- HOW DO YOU PERCEIVE THIS AS DIFFERENT FROM CAP AND TRADE? IN IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE HOW WOULD WE HOW WOULD WE PROTECT OURSELVES SO THE CAP AND TRADE IS DOING ONE THING AND AND THIS IS DOING SOMETHING ELSE OR MAYBE THEY'RE SYNERGISTIC. AND YOU HAVE A OPINION ON THAT. WHAT WE DO USE CAP AND TRADE FUNDING ON A LIMITED BASIS RIGHT NOW FOR A CLAIM IS SPECIFIC FOR CLIMB ADAPTATION ACTIVITY RIGHT MOSTLY WITH THE FOR THE -- COASTAL COMMISSION -- THE CONSERVANCY AND THE THE AND SAN FRANCISCO BAY AT FORTY AND SO -- THEY'RE MOSTLY WORKING ON CLIMATE -- LEVEL OF FACTS IN PLANNING AND AND SOME PROJECTS ALONG THE COAST -- IN TERMS OF HOW BONDS CAN BE USE VERSES CAP AND TRADE I THINK THEY THEY BOTH CAN BE USED FOR CLIMATE AT ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES I I WOULDN'T BE THEM IN MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. YOU MIGHT THINK IF IF YOU ARE FOR EXAMPLE THINKING ABOUT A LONGER TERM BROADER STRATEGY FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION. THERE MAY BE REASON TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO USE BONDS FOR THOSE LONGER TERM PROJECTS AND PERHAPS YOU'D WANT TO USE CAP AND TRADE FOR A DIFFERENT SET OF PROJECTS -- A IF YOU WANT IF YOU NEEDED TO DO MORE PLANNING YOU WOULDN'T REALLY WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT FOR HIM TO EXTRACT IT HE'S PLANNING ACTIVITY YOU MAY KNOW WHEN USED. YOUR BOND MONEY FOR THAT THAT MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE USE FOR CAP AND TRADE FUNDING BUT THERE'S NO REASON -- THAT I'M AWARE F THE CAP AND TRADE WOULD BE AN INAPPROPRIATE USE FOR ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES. THANK YOU OTHERS QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THE NINE DID. I CAN OPEN UP FOR A PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU CAN STICK OR WELL ENOUGH TO STICK AROUND YOU DID YOU DID YOUR SERVICE BUT WILL HOPE TO HEAR BACK FROM YOU AND AND FOLLOW UP ON CENTER CABALLERO AND TURNER MUNNINGS THREADS AS WELL IN TERMS OF DRILLING DOWN AND IF. YOU TRY TO PRIMARY COST DRIVERS. WE'RE LOOKING AT ARE LIKE REALLY TRIED GET GRANULAR AS MUCH AS WE CAN BUT THE LIABILITY INSERTED SOLUTION SETS TO DO THAT. I I APPRECIATE THE POINT ABOUT CARBON PRICING VERSES BOND -- APPROACHES SO -- WRESTLE WITH THAT ONE I'VE PUBLIC COMMENT. THANKS PAUL MASON PACIFIC FOREST TRUST AND I ACTUALLY WANTED -- TO BECOME TO THE I'M AT THE SERVER CABALLERO JUST MADE SORT OF YOU KNOW WE DO MAKE SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS WITH FOR EXAMPLE THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND I'M THINKING OF FOR EXAMPLE THE FOREST HEALTH INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE COMMITTED TO MAKING OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. ONE THING THAT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE WITH BOND FUNDING WENT OVER LAPS AND SERVE ISSUE AREA THERE WOULD BE OVERLAP BETWEEN I THINK ANY. SORT OF CLIMATE BOND AND MAKING SOME WATER SAID AND FOR US NOT TO RESOURCE OF INVESTMENTS AND THOSE SORT OF ALL OTHER TO EUROPE INVESTMENTS IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT SUPPLANTING. INVESTMENTS WE OTHERWISE WOULD BE MAKING. WEATHERBY FROM GENERAL FUND OR G. G. R. F. WITH THIS BOND MONEY BECAUSE THEN WE'RE NOT REALLY GETTING THAT ADDITIONAL -- PROGRESS TOWARDS THE CHALLENGE WHICH IS A STAGGERING CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF US MAKERS ARE THAT AS WE'RE BORROWING MONEY TO DO THESE THINGS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AND THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT THE STATE HAS STRUGGLED WITH MANY TIMES IN THE PAST YOU KNOW USING BOND MONEY TO FILL BUDGET CHALLENGES AND IT'S REALLY IT'S SICKENING IS NOT REALLY ACHIEVING. THE GOALS THAT WERE PRESENTED TO THE VOTERS WHEN THEY PROVE THESE THINGS. THANKS. WITHOUT FURTHER DO DID WE WANT TO CLOSE THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING ITEM AND HAVE CENTER ON PRESENT -- YES SO LET'S LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM AND THEN WE'LL -- WE'LL SHIP SO -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATE STERN STERN HERE JONES. JONES HERE ALAN. ALLEN HERE BURGESS. BURGESS HERE CABALLERO. CABALLERO PRESENT HERTZBERG HUESO. HUESO HERE JACKSON MONEY. MONEY IN HERE. VERY GOOD OF COURSE STATUS COMMITTEES CONVENED AND GO IN -- FILE ORDER HERE SO -- CENTER ALLEN SB. FORTY FIVE WELL THERE IS A MISMATCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I DO ALSO APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION FROM THE LA -- THAT I THINK HELP HELPS THE FAMILY SOME OF THE ASPECTS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I ALSO ALSO OF COURSE WANT TO EXTEND MY GRATITUDE THANKS TO THE FOLKS FROM THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH MY STAFF AND ON ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THIS MEASURE AND I AM. VERY HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. NOW IS THE HOUSES POINTS OUT THIS BILL SB FORTY FIVE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND WE REMAIN VERY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING. THE ON GOING WORK -- WITH BOTH THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- AS TO THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD TODAY. THE IDEA OF THIS BILL IS THAT IF IF THIS PASSED BY THE VOTERS. SB FORTY FIVE WILL IT WOULD FIND ON THE GROUND PROJECTS DESIGNED TO HELP US PREPARE FOR THE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. AND OTHER IMPACTS THAT WE'RE SEEING AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE -- AND AS A RESULT OF OF ALL OF OUR CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. WILDFIRES FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES DROUGHTS IT CENTER -- WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD TODAY THAT HAS WORN BY JUST ONE DEGREE SINCE THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS WHEN RECORDS -- BEGAN ON A GLOBAL SCALE. AND THAT MEANS THAT THE FIRES MUDSLIDES ARE PROLONGED DROUGHT OR SEVERE WEATHERS -- STORMS ARE ALL A RESULT OF A CHANGE OF JUST ONE DEGREE CELSIUS BUT THE SAD TRUTH IS. THAT -- WE KNOW THAT THE LEASES SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US THAT -- THE INCREASES ARE GOING TO BE QUITE A BIT MORE SIGNIFICANT THE GOAL OF THE GLOBAL PARIS CLIMATE. AGREEMENT WAS TO KEEP THE WORLD'S TEMPERATURE FROM RISING MORE THAN TWO DEGREES CELSIUS OVER PRE INDUSTRIAL TIMES BUT THE AGREEMENTS MORE AMBITIOUS GOALS -- WAS TO PREVENT TEMPERATURES ARE RISING MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES. CELSIUS AND THAT'S BECAUSE EVEN ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES OF WARMING WILL CAUSE CATASTROPHIC EFFECTS INCLUDING MORE INTENSE STORMS. HEARING HE WEIGHS MASS EXTINCTIONS DROUGHTS ETCETERA. AND IF WE HAD TWO DEGREES THE EFFECTS WILL BE EVEN WORSE. NOW THAT THE TRUTH IS THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW THAT WE'RE ON TRACK RIGHT NOW TO SEE MORE THAN THREE PER THREE DEGREES OF INCREASED ABOVE PREINDUSTRIAL LEVELS BY. TWENTY ONE HUNDRED ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE NOT ON TRACK OUT TOWARD THE SCHOOL SO THE POINT IS. WE WE ARE WE'RE FIGHTING AGAINST THE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO MITIGATE AND AND AND AND REDUCE OUR ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE CLIMATE CHANGE IS HAPPENING. WE SEE IN THE IMPACTS OF ALL ALREADY AND WE NEED TO HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO PROTECT AGAINST -- THE IMPACTS AND BE MORE RESILIENT. AND SO -- WHAT THIS MEASURED SEEKS TO DO IS REDUCE FIRE RESCUE AND RESTORE ALREADY DAMAGED AREAS A RESTORED PROTECT IMPACTED WETLANDS WATERSHEDS WATERWAYS? COASTAL RESOURCES FISH AND WILDLIFE POPULATIONS REDUCE IMPACTS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND ON VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND IMPROVE THE RESILIENCY OF THE STATE'S WATER SUPPLIES AND AGRICULTURAL LANDS. NO ONE LIKE PREVIOUS BOND MEASURES TO FIND PARKS AND OPEN SPACE ALL THINGS THAT WE SUPPORT -- THIS BOND IS FOCUSED ON HELPING OUR STATE BECOME MORE RESILIENT TO RISING TEMPERATURES AND TO ENSURE THAT WERE ABLE TO ADAPT. TO A CHANGING CLIMATE THAT'S THE FOCUS HERE SO DEDICATES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING TO THE FIRE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IT WILL -- FUND PROJECTS THAT WILL REDUCE FIRE RISK IN YOUR CMMUNITIES AND ENSURE A FORCE ARE HEALTHY ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND MORE INTENSE WILDFIRES. ARE THERE OTHER POTS THAT INVEST IN PROJECTS THAT WILL REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC FLOOD EVENTS BY SLOWING RUNOFF IMPROVING GROUND WATER INFILTRATION. AND PROTECTING COASTAL COMMUNITIES FROM SEA LEVEL RISE. SO THERE IS A THERE ARE NUMBER OF OF DIFFERENT THINGS WE CAN OPEN UP THIS DISCUSSION -- BUT YOU KNOW THE FACT IS THAT WHEN WE HAD OUR INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE NEW ABNORMAL IN FIRE PRONE REGIONS WE HEARD THE REGION NINE ADMINISTRATOR FOR FEMA SAY VERY EXPLICITLY THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED IN PREVENTION WE CAN SAVE SIX DOLLARS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE WE MUST TAKE AGGRESSIVE ACTION. AT IN IN MITIGATING THE IMPACT IN INCREASING OUR RESILIENCY AND I HAVE WITH ME JOE HAD MISSING FOR THE NONCE RECREATION -- CONSERVATION AUTHORITY AND ALSO I MEAN I TIGHTLY WHO'S THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS DISTRICT FIRE CHIEF. WHO ARE BOTH HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL? GOOD WELCOME. MISREPRESENT. THE GERMAN MEMBERS AT JOE WITNESSED AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE MOUNT RECREATION CONSERVATION AUTHORITY WHICH IS A JOINT POWERS BETWEEN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY AND OUR RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT PARTNERS. IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS -- THE LA -- WAS VERY RESTRAINED AS THEY ALWAYS ARE. VERY -- AND CLICK CLICK CLICK. I'M NOT GOING TO BE RESTRAINED MISTER CHAIRMAN BECAUSE I COME FROM YOUR DISTRICT. A THIRD YOUR DISTRICT BURNED LAST YEAR. ALMOST 50% OF THE REST IS IN DANGER. WE'RE LOOKING AT FLASH EQUALS. IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE THOSE BEAUTIFUL WILD FLOWERS IT WAS WONDERFUL SHE THE ALL THE GREEN GRASS. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS WE CALL THAT. CAN GOING [inaudible] IT'S KINDLING. AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER DROUGHT SUMMER. AND TWO YEARS AGO THREE YEARS AGO I REMEMBER EVERYONE WAS SAYING YOU KNOW THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY SITUATIONS WE HAVE HERE WE COME I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT BEFORE. AND THEN THE YEAR AFTER THAT IT WAS -- WE INTERESTING WE'RE SEEING IT NOW TWICE IN A ROW. AFTER LAST YEAR WE CANNOT SAY. WELL MAYBE THINGS WILL GET BETTER. I THINK THE BETTER ARGUMENT IS THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET WORSE. AN EVEN IF THIS BILL IS PASSED AND IF IT IS EVEN IF IT IS PASSED IN MARCH. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HEAR IS BEFORE THIS MONEY CAN ACTUALLY GET OUT AND DO SOME GOOD. SO WE FOR AIMING TO DEAL WITH AN EMERGENCY SITUATION WHICH I THINK WE ARE MISTER CHAIRMAN IN YOUR DISTRICT AND WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH YOU TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. IMMEDIATELY WE GOT TWO YEARS WORTH OF DANGER. AND THIS IS TRUE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WHICH IS ACADEMIC THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DECIDE WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO BALANCE TWENTY YEARS FORTY YEARS WHATEVER IT IS. TELL THAT TO PEOPLE. WHO ILL COME BACK TO THIS LEGISLATURE AND SAY YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGE TO MAKE THINGS BETTER TO ADAPT CALIFORNIA? IF YOU ANSWER TO THEM WE TRIED OUR BEST WONDERFUL IF YOU ANSWERED WELL WE DIDN'T F. SAID. I CHIEF. AGAIN MY NAME IS EILEEN TIGHTLY I AM THE FIRE CHIEF EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT THAT WE WERE FOUND IN NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY NOT KNOW WHERE THE LARGEST LOCAL PARK. DISTRICT OR AGENCY IN THE NATION -- WE OPERATE OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE THOUSAND ACRES. AND WE SERVE TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION RESIDENTS IN ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. SO WE ALSO ENJOY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION VISITORS A YEAR. I AM MY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS THE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS TO THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE TUNNEL FIRE WE CALL IT WHETHER THE MEDIA CALL THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE. AND IN THAT FIRE IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT IT WAS THREE THOUSAND HOMES THAT WERE LOST ONLY THREE THOUSAND HOMES THAT WERE LOST YOU COULD SAY NOW. AND AT TWENTY SIX PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES. WHAT THAT REALLY DID FOR THE PARK DISTRICT WAS -- AS A LARGE LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCY IS -- TO CALL US TO FOCUS ON RESILIENT FIRE PROTECTION AS AS ALMOST A MORAL MANDATE. SO AS A LARGE LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCY WE UNDERSTAND THE NECESSARY THE NECESSITY BETWEEN STEWARDSHIP OF THE LAND AND ALSO FORCE MANAGEMENT. WE FOUND IN OUR PRACTICES THAT EQUALS RESILIENCY WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT WE CAN STOP A FIRE FROM HAPPENING ON OUR LANDS BUT WE ARE SAYING THAT WITH STEWARDSHIP AND FORCE MANAGEMENT. WE CAN MAKE OUR FORESTS -- IN OUR WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE IS MORE RESILIENT THE FIRES IN THERE FOR AMERICA MORE SURVIVABLE -- SO AT THAT POINT WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A LONG TERM UNDERSTANDING COMMITMENT REALLY TO HEALTHY FORESTS. WITH THAT COMMITMENT CAME A WILD FIRE HAZARD REDUCTION AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT OUR BOARD SIGNED -- IN TWENTY TEN AND WE ONLY RECENTLY GOT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE TO ACTUALLY SPEND THOSE MONIES. IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I GUESS THE MESSAGE WE WANT TO SEND IS THAT THE THE CLOCK IS REALLY TAKING DEMAND. WILL INCREASE AND ACCELERATE. AS CLIMATE CHANGE -- CONTINUES. TO BE HERE THE NEED IS URGENT. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT WAS LAST YEAR FOR THIRTEEN DAYS SOLID -- IN THE BAY AREA IT'S GOT OVER TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE OF THOSE JUST THE THE RESIDENTS THAT LIVE WITHIN ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. WE HAD THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE OF THE CAMPFIRE -- WORSE THAN BEIJING AND IT SHUT DOWN SCHOOLS FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND ALSO A LOT OF BUSINESSES AND AND I'M SURE -- WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT -- ECONOMICALLY -- A BONDS OF THIS OF THIS NATURE WOULD REALLY ACCELERATE THE WORK AND LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM CAL FIRE FEMA HELLO YES. AND WE'RE IN A RACE AT THIS POINT. CATASTROPHIC FIRES RELEASE MORE CARBON EXACERBATING THE PACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE SAW THAT AS AN EXAMPLE THAT I JUST GAVE YOU OF OF THE THIRTEEN DAYS WHERE PEOPLE WERE WEARING. MASKS EVERY TIME THEY WENT OUTSIDE. THIS BOND MEASURE IS KIND OF A FIRST RESPONDER TOOL -- IT'S URGENT. IT'S JUST ONE POLL TOOL THAT WE CAN USE THE TOOL BOX -- LONG TERM VEGETATION MANAGEMENT NEEDS. REQUIRE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND STATEWIDE COMMITMENTS. AND SENATOR ALLEN'S BOND MEASURE STARTS A CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. KAUFMAN GERMAN STERN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PROMISE OF THE FOREST TRUST AGAIN. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK FOR DECADES NOW AND I'D SAY THE THING THAT SCARES ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS THE LACK OF URGENCY. THAT WE'VE SEEN AROUND ADAPTING TO THE INEVITABLE AFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE TALK A LOT ABOUT HOW IT'S GONNA GET A LITTLE BIT WARMER A LITTLE BIT DRIER TWO DEGREES AT ALL SEEMS A CONCEPTUALLY MANAGEABLE. AND THAT'S GONNA BE BAD BUT IS THE EXTREME EVENTS THAT ARE REALLY GOING TO BE DEVASTATING THOSE YOU KNOW ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS AT THIS PARK AND DROPPING ALL TWO FEET OF WATER IN A WATERSHED OVER A COUPLE OF DAYS. THOSE ARE WHERE WE ARE SO FAR BEHIND THE CURVE OFGETTING PREPARED. DO WE REALLY NEED TO JUMP START THOSE ACTIVITIES TO DO THE THINGS IN WHAT AROUND COMMUNITIES AND UPLAND WATERSHEDS WHERE WE CAN SLOW THAT RUN OFF AND MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT GETTING DEVASTATING FLOODS COMING DOWN INTO TOWN. AND BEING BETTER PREPARED FOR FIRES SO SB FORTY FIVE IS THAT JUMP START THAT WE NEED THANK YOU SIR. FOR THE WITNESS IS TESTIFYING IF YOU IF YOU HAVE A QUICK POINT. PLEASE MAKE IT. BUT IF YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD IT MADE THAN A ME TOO WILL BE FINE BUT I KNOW WE'VE GOT A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS HERE SO. LET'S TRY. TO KEEP THE DIALOGUE.

I SEE NO OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANY IN OPPOSITION. THIS INVOLVES SEEING NINE MEMBERS QUESTIONS COMMENTS A CEREMONY IN IN THIS CENTER CAREER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANT TO THINK THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I THINK THE EARLIER. LA -- PRESENTATION WAS. COMPLIMENTARY. TO THE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS SIN INDEED THE EXTREME IMPORTANCE GIVEN WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST I HAD JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- WITH FOCUS ON SEA LEVEL RISE RESILIENCY ADAPTATION I KNOW COASTAL CONSERVANCY'S IDENTIFIED HERE BUT NOTHING FOR THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL WOULD YOU CONSIDER THE OPC TO HAVE ANY. ROLL I THINK WE OFTEN GET TO OUR SHORELINE BUT WE DON'T LOOK AT HOW OCEAN HEALTH IS AFFECTING. THESE DYNAMICS IN IS. WE ARE CONNECTED AND I WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER. OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL IS POSSIBLY CONTRIBUTING. TO THE RESILIENCE AN ADAPTATION -- AND THEN ALSO JUST TO A MORE GENERAL QUESTION. IS THERE ANY METRIC THE YEAR WHERE EVER THAT WE COULD LOOK. FOR THAT WOULD LOOK AT HOW INVESTMENT DOLLARS MOST DIRECTLY. PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH IN OTHER WORDS -- WRIT LARGE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS PUBLIC HEALTH BUT IN TERMS OF OUR INVESTMENTS. THERE MAY BE SOME THAT MORE IMMEDIATELY PROTECT COMMUNITIES AT RISK. WHETHER IT'S AIR POLLUTION -- OTHER THAN THAT HAVE A A TRACEABLE IN CURRENTLY KNOWN PUBLIC HEALTH ADVERSE IMPACTS SO. I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU HAVE I'M NOT REALLY ASKING FOR AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW IT JUST SAYS THAT -- AS WE A PORTION INVESTMENT. LET'S DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH ASSN AT RISK COMMUNITIES. THEY BOTH FANTASTIC SUGGESTS ACTUALLY SERVE ON THE OCEAN PACIFIC COUNCIL SO -- I'M BY IT'S A GREAT SUGGESTION WELL TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO INCORPORATE THEM IN AYE AYE I LOVE YOUR IDEA ABOUT. THE PUBLIC HEALTH METRICS YOU DESERVE PARTICULAR GOOD WHEN THE YOU. NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF ALTHOUGH WE COULD ACCESS EXISTING RESOURCES WHETHER SALIH OR THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. OR WHEN WE LOOK AT THE CATEGORIES OF INVESTMENT SOME MAY HAVE A MORE IMMEDIATE BENEFIT TO AIR QUALITY AND OR I MEAN LSS OF PROPERTIES THROW FIRE RISK YES MEDIA PUBLIC HEALTH. RISKS BUT AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD CENTER HAVE YEAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I ALSO WANTED -- AB BRIEFER STARTING IN INTERESTING DISCUSSION. BECAUSE I THINK I AM I THINK THERE'S SOME SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITIES HERE RIGHT. I ALSO WANNA I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS -- PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO RURAL CALIFORNIA -- I THINK THERE'S SOME CLIMATE CHANGE CHANGE BY PRODUCTS THAT ARE -- FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT THAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT -- ONE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR FOOD SHORTAGES SEARCH SHORTAGE JUDGE METICULOUSLY -- AS IT RELATES TO FEEDING OUR COUNTRY -- I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT -- WAS THAT. A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE THAT WE CONTROL OUR OWN FOOD SOURCE BECAUSE THE MINUTE SOMEONE DOESN'T LIKE US THAT ME. REALLY IMPACT -- HOW WE GET OUR FOOD AND IT'S BECOME MORE CLEAR WITH THEIR -- WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WERE ANGERING A BUNCH OF OUR ALLIES AND THEY MAY NOT WANT TO HELP US EAT -- IN THE FUTURE -- BUT ALSO IT WOULD THERE'S A GREAT POTENTIAL -- FOR FOR THE CONFLUENCE OF ISSUES STATION. DEVASTATING IMPACT ON RURAL RESIDENTS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE IF WE HAVE TO FOLLOW AND WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD -- SOLUTION TO WHAT THE WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THAT LAND ALTERNATIVELY THAT WE MAY END UP WITH DUST BOWL TYPE OF MIGRATION PATTERNS THAT. REALLY NOT DEVASTATOR RURAL RURAL COMMUNITIES ECONOMIES BUT ALSO MAKE PEOPLE MOVE -- FROM WROTE CALIFORNIA AND LOSE ALL OF THE ASSETS THAT THEY'VE INVESTED THERE AS WELL SMALL FARMERS AS WELL AS AS WHOLE WHOLE COMMUNITIES -- SO I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT SO THAT WE CAN. LOOK DOWN THE ROAD AND WE MEAN NEED TO DO. I MEAN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF OF WHAT THE LA -- PRESENTED BUT WE MAY NEED TO DO SOME MODELING SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHERE ARE THE IMPACTS LIKELY TO HIT FIRST -- AND HOW CAN WE START CREATING THE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO DO THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY WHETHER IT'S MOVE WATER WHETHER IT'S CREATE -- OTHER SOLUTIONS THEY'RE NOT ON WERE EIGHTY GREAT IDEAS LED TO WORK WITH YOU AND BY THE WAY I CAN HELP AND NOTICE. PART OF THE BIG DISCUSSION ABOUT BREXIT RIGHT NOW IN THE U. K. IS IS WHAT DISTRICT CREDIBLE DISRUPTION. THE BREAK AWAY FROM THE YOU WILL COST TO THEIR FOOD CHAIN FOOD SUPPLY BECAUSE THEY'VE BECOME SO DEPENDENT ON GROWERS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE FOR THE REGION AND IT'S REALLY. A MAJOR STICKING POINT. SO THAT THAT'S A VERY INSTRUCTIVE POINT [inaudible] YEAH. VERY GOOD SENATOR HUESO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND GOOD MORNING I I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING UP THIS ISSUE IN THAT IT ALREADY LOOKS LIKE YOU PUT AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK INTO IT. NOT AN EASY THING TO DO. AND AND GETTING TO THE KIND OF THE URGENCY OF THE MATTER I JUST WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE BUDGETED. ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION TO RESPOND FIRE SENT -- TO OF BUTTRESS. OUR OUR FIRE OF SERVICES IN OUR STATE. THAT'S THAT'S QUITE A BIT. MORE MORE THAN. MORE THAN I'VE EVER SEEN. IN RECENT HISTORY AND THAT IS DEFINITELY OUT OF CONCERN FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE. AND THEN IF WE REALLY HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY ON THIS I I DO THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE. AS I REVIEWED THE BILL -- I WILL I JUST WANT TO SHARE MY CONCERNS OF THE YOU AND JUST WHAT WHAT I'VE SEEN AND AND I'D LIKE US TO REALLY RELY ON ON THE SCIENCE OF HOW WE'RE GONNA. BUT START TO ADDRESS. THIS PROBLEM FACING OUR STATE THE FIRES. OF NOT ALL OF THE FIRE ISSUE -- THE THE FORCED ISSUE -- CLIMATE pWE'VE BEEN PASS AND BILLS AND WE'VE BEEN DOING OUR PART AND I AND I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY FOR OVER A DECADE. TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND TO ADDRESS OUR QUALITY AND TO I DON'T DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. BUT I THINK WE'VE BEEN LEADERS IN THE COUNTRY AND UNFORTUNATELY OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S NOT BACKING US UP. IN EVERY AREA WHEN WE'VE NEEDED HELP WITH -- MANAGING OUR FORESTS EVEN FEDERALLY MANAGED FORESTS THEY'RE NOT MANAGING. DOING WHAT'S WITHIN CLEARLY THERE THEIR AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY. AND SO WE ALMOST HAVE TO ACT ALONE IN THIS BECAUSE I DON'T SEE ANYTHING COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP CALIFORNIA AND UNFORTUNATELY WE SUBSIDIZE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. WITH OUR TAXES AND WE DON'T SEE THOSE TAXES COME BACK TO OUR STATE THAT'S JUST THE UNFORTUNATE PART. BUT IT WITH REGARD TO WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER AND YOU KNOW THEIR TESTS TO BE A TENDENCY HERE IN THIS LEGISLATURE WHAT I'VE SEEN WHAT WHENEVER WE PUT TOGETHER SOME KIND OF BOND. OR SOME ON THE BUS SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM THAT -- PEOPLE TEND TO STICK IN THEIR PRIORITIES. AND THAT JUST THAT THAT JUST HAPPENS -- VERY ORGANICALLY HERE. WHERE WHERE EVERYBODY JUST SAYS WHAT ABOUT ME WHAT ABOUT MY DISTRICT AND I GET THAT AND AND AND I'M HERE TO TO FIGHT FOR MY DISTRICT AS WELL [inaudible] BUT I I'D LIKE TO SEE IS PUT TOGETHER BOND THAT IS BASED ON SCIENCE I MEAN THERE THERE ARE NUMEROUS NEEDS ACROSS THE STATE. BUT WHICH ONE IS GOING TO MAXIMIZE OUR BOND DOLLAR BECAUSE WOULDN'T WORK WHEN WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE RIGHT NOW. WE'RE GETTING TO THAT POINT. WHERE OUR STATE IS GOING TO BE OVER LEVERAGE SOME BONDS WE'VE DONE A LOT OF BONDS? AND AND TO VOTER INITIATIVES WE'VE DONE BONDS [inaudible] AND AND THOSE BONDS ARE VERY COSTLY. AND IF WE SEE A DOWNTURN ARE BUDGET WHICH IS WHERE WE'RE APPROACHING THAT CYCLE WE'RE GOING TO SEE OUR OUR OUR OUR REVENUES GO DOWN SHARPLY LIKE THEY DID IN. 220-009-2000. TEN OUR OUR DEBT. IN PROPORTION TO OUR REVENUE. RIGHT NOW IS IS PRETTY AVERAGE. BUT IN A DOWNTURN THAT THAT THAT'S GONNA THE PROPORTIONS CAN INCREASE SHARPLY. ANY REDUCTION. IN IN OUR REVENUE IS GONNA MEAN. A DISPROPORTIONATE INCREASE IN ON TERMS OF THAT THE BURKE RATIO WE HAVE TO BE VERY. CAREFUL TO THAT HE IS MINDFUL OF THAT INCLUDING PUTTING IN SOME KIND OF MECHANISM. TO ALLOW EITHER THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO TO NOT ISSUE A BOND. IN CASE OF EXTREME HARDSHIP. AND AND AND HAVING SOME KIND OF TRIGGER THAT ALLOWS US TO TO FOREGO THAT THERE ARE STE THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT SHOULD SHOULD -- ALLOW US TO MANAGE OUR FINANCES ONE INCLUDING IN. OUR IN OUR CREDIT RATING AND WHAT THAT MEANS TO INTEREST RATES -- AND ANOTHER IS WHAT WHAT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ARE BUDGET GOES DOWN ARE WE TIED TO HAVE INITIALLY. HAVING TO ISSUE BONDS AND IT AND IT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT MEET MAY BECOME A NECESSITY BUT WE NEED TO HAVE -- THAT RETAIN THAT DECISION MAKING POWER IN THE LEGISLATURE TO THE SIDE SHOULD WE MOVE FORWARD WITH. ISSUE IN DEBT OR SHOULD WE CURB THAT FOR NOW. TO TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET THAT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING WE COULD CONSIDER BUT GOING BACK TO THE SCIENCE. YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW CURRENTLY WHEN I READ I READ THIS I SEE THIS BOND. AT ABOUT -- JUST UNDER FIVE BILLION FOUR POINT. THREE BILLION DOLLARS WERE TRYING TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM. I LOOK GO THROUGH THE LIST AND WORK WERE DRESSING SAFE DRINKING WATER. WE'RE LOOKING AT GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT. WE'RE LOOKING A STORM WATER CAPTURE FOR ITS RESILIENCY OF FOREST RESTORATION SEA LEVEL RISE REDUCING. THE WILD FIRE RISK FLOOD MANAGEMENT PROTECTION. OF PROTECTING FIH AND WILDLIFE RESTORING IMPACTED WATER BODIES ALL OF THOSE THINGS. ARE VERY IMPORTANT. BUT WHAT IS OUR PRIORITY RIGHT NOW AND IF WE ARE GOING TO GO TO ISSUE IN THAT. WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON A RE GONNA FOCUS ON MAKING OUR STATE MORE RESILIENT TO WILDFIRES? OR WE GONNA OR WE GONNA. SOLVE EVERY OTHER PROBLEM. ALONG WITH THAT AND REALLY NOT DO EITHER. MAYBE MAYBE THIS WILL HELP US TO A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING. BUT IS THAT WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW SHOULD WE BE PRIORITIZING -- RESILIENCY I THINK THE MESSAGE FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO THE VOTERS ARE WE WILL IF WE ARE GOING TO BOND. IF WE ARE GOING TO GO DOWN THAT ROUTE. I THINK WE SHOULD. FOCUS. I THINK WE SHOULD DEVELOP A PLAN. AND DEVELOP A VERY CLEAR STRATEGY WHO'S GOING TO IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN OR WE GONNA HAVE VARIOUS AGENCIES WORKING INDEPENDENTLY TO FOCUS ON THEIR OWN ISSUES. WHEN WE WILL WE DEVELOP SILOS IT WEAKENS OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGY? AND THAT'S THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS -- SENATOR. AND AND I I I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. WITH YOU ON THIS I'D LOVE TO COME UP. WITH SOMETHING THAT THAT -- SERVES OUR STATE BUT HOPEFULLY WILL DO THIS FROM LENDS. BOB GOOD. OF FISCAL PRUDENCE. WITH WITH A FOCUS ON SOLVING. THE BIGGEST THREATS TO OUR STATE. OR FACING OUR STATE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR HUESO CENTER BORDERS. THANK CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE MY THE COMMENTS FROM -- MY MY COLLEAGUE -- SENATOR HUESO IN THE CENTER COVER EURO I THINK -- THEY BROUGHT OUT SOME ASSUME SINCE SOME GOOD POINTS. I'LL I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE. AND I BELIEVE THAT OUR CLIMATE HAS -- ON BEEN UNDERGOING SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AND TO THINK OTHERWISE I THINK IS PUTTING YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND -- SO I'M GONNA PUT THAT OUT THERE. AT THE OUTSET -- I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF BUILDING A STRATEGY. BASED ON SCIENCE BASED ON PRIORITIES. SO I COMMEND -- YOUR YOUR PROPOSAL ON THE EVE THAT YOU PUT FORWARD FOR US TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WITH SUCH A LARGE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT -- THIS WOULD BE A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DEVISE -- A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY BASED ON THE INPUT OF PERSONS MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FIELDS -- CREATING A LIST AND I THINK -- MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED THAT EVERYONE OF US IS GOING TO SAY. THIS IS A GREAT IDEA BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT MY DISTRICT YOU KNOW EVERY ONE OF US IS GOING TO HAVE -- A COMMONER -- TO LIKE THAT AND I'M NO DIFFERENT -- I BELIEVE THAT -- THE THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- IS GROUND ZERO WHEN IT COMES TO AGRICULTURAL CHALLENGES WATER INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES SO ON SO FORTH -- THAT'S WHY BEEN -- SUCH A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF THE A REQUEST FOR FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR FRANKLIN CAN NOW. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO TO TO YOU -- CENTER ALLEN IS THAT. AS THIS MOVES ALONG -- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IF THERE IS A WAY TO DEVISE AN OVERARCHING STRATEGY -- FOR THE USE OF THESE DOLLARS -- IN HOW THE ITERCONNECTS TO GIVE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED CERTAIN AMOUNTS TO ADMINISTER. HOW DO THEY ALL RELATE BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN -- PROJECTS THAT SHOULD HAVE HIGHER PRIORITY BASED ON THE OBJECTIVE NEEDS OF OF OF A GIVEN ISSUE. SO WHAT AT WHAT POINT IN THIS PROCESS WOULD SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BE POSSIBLE DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS. WELL. TWO AND A EIGHT I THINK YOU'RE BOTH OF THE QUESTIONS OF A FASTENER WESTERN CENTER BOARD JUST DOVETAIL NICELY -- I WILL SAY THAT THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNTS THAT ARE -- THAT ARE THAT ARE LAID OUT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE THAT THE MAIN FOCUS IS ON WILDFIRE RESILIENCY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE RELATED AND AND AND AND VITALLY IMPORTANT -- BUT THAT IT REALLY IS AT THE THE CORE OF THE THE BOND I WILL SAY THAT TO SOME EXTENT THIS IS ALSO A RESPONSE. TO THE FAILED ATTEMPTS -- THE LAST ELECTION THAT IMPROPER -- THREE WHICH DID HAVE A NUMBER WATER PROJECTS OTHER PROJECTS -- IT ROLLED INTO IT AND YET AND IF YOU SEE IT IT DID WELL -- IT BUT EVEN THOSE FOLKS WHO CAME OUT SUPPORT. DID SO VERY RELUCTANTLY THERE WERE A LOT OF EDITORIAL BOARDS IT REALLY -- OPENLY. NOW WE'RE TORN ABOUT WHETHER TO SUPPORTED NOT BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS SUCH A SUCH A ENTREPRENEURIAL CHRISTMAS TREE -- AND IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW BASICALLY GETTING VARIOUS FOLKS TO TO JOIN ON AND BE A PART OF IT -- BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY WOULD GET THEIR LITTLE PIECE OF PIPE BUT IT REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH OF A OVER ARCHING STRATEGY BEHIND IT. AND SO SO THESE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS AND I THINK ULTIMATELY IT IS GOING TO TAKE A LIKE A SMART. AND AND AND KIND OF THOUGHT FULL. SENATE DIRECTION FROM FROM LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AND AND GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- IF IT'S IF IT'S IMPLEMENTED TO HELP. TO BOTH DEAL WITH FISCAL PRUDENCE ISSUES AND I THINK THAT WE ABSOLUTE UP I KNOW IT BE BACK YOU KNOW EIGHT OR NINE WE DIDN'T ISSUE BONDS FOR EXAMPLE ON THE NATURAL BECAUSE OF THE THE DIFFICULT. FINANCIAL CONDITIONS BUT I DO THINK WE GOT TO PUT SOME STRONG LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE AND THE GOVERNOR TO ADD TO TO NOT ISSUE BONDS WHEN IT. JUST DOESN'T MAKE FINANCIAL SENSE WE WE GOT WITH THAT WE OUGHT NOT HAVE A A KIND OF A A ROCK HARD. YOU KNOW -- SET OF REQUIREMENTS FOR ISSUANCE IT BECAUSE THERE'S CERTAIN TIMES WHEN THE MARKET CONDITIONS JUST DON'T LEND THEMSELVES TO DOING SO -- SO THAT THAT WE OUGHT TO PUT IN -- AND THEN AND THEN IN THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT. I YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S REAL COHERENCE AT THIS AND THAT'S PART OF THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO INVOLVE ME THIS COMMITTEE IS A CRITICAL PART OF THAT PROCESS RIGHT THIS IS WHERE THERE'S EXPERTISE. AND AND AND WORKING WITH OF COUNTERPARTS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. TO YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT THERE REALLY IS A KIND OF A STRATEGY ASSOCIATED WITH THE WAY THAT THE THE BOND -- IS IS FORMULATED AND AND IT'S A IT'S A BIT OF A DANCE IS WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW GET. POLITICAL SUPPORT NOT ONLY WITHIN THIS BUILDING BUT THEN OUT WITH THE VOTERS -- BUT PART OF WHY I WANTED TO DO THIS WAS BECAUSE I SAW WHAT HAPPENED PROP THREE AND I SAW THE FACT THAT IT WAS SO. THAT PROCESS WAS SO PROBLEMATIC AND AND I MEAN IT WOULD BE A THIS THIS IS GOING TO BE HARD ENOUGH TO COME MANAGE AND AND WE'RE DOING THIS ALL TOGETHER AS A AS A TEAM. I THAT WAS A PARTICULARLY -- YOU KNOW -- BE ENTREPRENEURIAL PROD PROCESS THAT THAT I THOUGHT TOO HAPHAZARD IN TERMS OF OF OF ENGAGING PEOPLE AND NOT REALLY HAPHAZARD IT WAS IT WAS A LITTLE TOO OP IS MAYBE TO TRANSACTIONAL PERHAPS. AND SO I'M YOU GUYS ARE TOUCHING ON ALL THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND IT'S PART OF WHAT GAVE ME PAUSE WHEN I WAS CONSIDERING EVEN PROPOSING THIS. BECAUSE THESE GET BIG AND YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU BI&lt;c.cyan&gt; ULTIMATELY HAVE A&lt;/c&gt; REAL IMPACT BOTH ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND ON RESILIENCY. AND AND WE'VE TRIED TO CRAFTED IN A WAY THAT. IS COHERENT BUT BUT WE ABSOLUTELY WELCOME THE THE THE CONTINUAL ENGAGEMENT OF WHAT THE COMMITTEE BUT EVERYONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THROUGH THIS PROCESS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT I KNOW THAT'S A I I KNOW THAT'S NOT IT'S BE SPECIFIC ANSWER YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT IT'S A HARD. ONE TO HIS HEART YEAH SO HERE'S MY UNABASHED PLUG FOR THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT OKAY -- PART OF THE PROBLEM SENATOR. SO I THINK. WE HAVE A CONFIDENCE ISSUE -- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- ABOUT. BEEN NICELY WORDED BONDS. THAT -- ARE DESCRIPTIVE AND EVERYONE CAN BUY INTO -- THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THEIR PASSAGE. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS -- WHEN THEY GO TO A RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENT OR? A BODY THAT IF MINISTERS THOSE FUNDS. THE SCIENCE GETS REALLY FUNNY. AND I BELIEVE THAT SITE SHOULD BE OUR OBJECTIVE IN IT SHOULD BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FAX. BUT SOMETIMES INDIVIDUAL OR AREAS THAT WERE EXPECTING TO RECEIVE DOLLARS. AND THIS GOES BACK TO WATER INFRASTRUCTURE INTO WHETHER IT'S TEMPERANCE WHETHER IT'S RECHARGE BASINS ARE SO ON AND SO FORTH. AND THERE IS CERTAIN REGIONS JUST DON'T GET WHAT THEY'RE PROMISED EVEN WITH THE WEEK AND THEN DODD IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS SO YOU CAN KIND OF SEE WHERE SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY I WANT TO SPEAK FOR CENTER COPIER BUT YOU MIGHT VERY WELL AGREE -- SO THAT'S WHY. I BECOME MORE OF A FAN OF ARTICULATING THE RECIPIENTS. AND THE THE AREAS IN THE WORDING OF THE BOND SO WE CAN AVOID THE AMBIGUITY OF OF OF WHAT THE REP WITH THE RECIPIENT MIGHT BE IN THE IN THE LONG TERM -- BECAUSE WE HAVE A WAY OF JUST KIND OF CHANGING THAT OUT. WOULD YOU BE OPEN. TO IF THERE WERE MASTER STRATEGY. BEING MORE SPECIFIC IN THE WORDING OF THE BOND WE'RE RECIPIENT -- DOLLARS WOULD MOST LIKELY GO. IT'S A TRICKY THING SENATOR AYE AYE AYE DOUBTS WE HEAR YOU I'D LOVE TO GET A BETTER SENSE AND OTHER. MEN IF YOU WILL BE HAPPY TO SEE IF YOU WANNA SAY IT NOW WHEN YOU SAY THE SCIENCE GETS FUNNY CAN YOU. CLARIFY THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND A USE TEMPERATE FLIGHT AS AN EXAMPLE. THE NOTION. OF THEM THE MODELING THAT WAS USED TO DETERMINE -- WE'RE THE WAS IT WAS A PROP. ONE PROP ONE FUNDING WAS GOING TO GO FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE -- THE MODELING THAT DETERMINE THAT BENEFICIAL USE WAS ONE OF THE METRICS. AND IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO STOMACH. THE IDEA THAT. THE AGRICULTURAL REAPER -- AREA OF THE VALLEY AND TO THE THE INDIVIDUALS -- IN THE RURAL AREAS -- IN THE NEED FOR CLEAN DRINKING WATER SO ON AND SO FORTH WE'RE NOT VIEWED UPON AS A BOB AND OFFICIALS USE OF COURSE. BLEW OUR MINDS ARE EVEN THOUGH THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE CLEARLY INVOLVED IN THE SUCCESSFUL PASSAGE OF THAT -- WERE ANTICIPATING THAT -- THE VALLEY WOULD WOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THAT SO THAT I USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE THAT THE SCIENCE IS THERE BUT THE MODELING HE TENDS TO HAVE THE GOAL POST MOVE OVER TIME. THAT ONE'S BEEN TOO MUCH TIME YEAH NO I AM SO MAYBE A CASE LIKE THAT MAYBE MAYBE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SPECIFICITY MAYBE MAYBE THE ANSWER IS TO TO REALLY PUT IN SPECIFICITY WITH REGARDS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND AND YOU KNOW I'M AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY SO. WE CAN USE THE GENERAL LANGUAGE BUT STILL SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO TO GET TO THE CORE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS YES SO IT ALL IT FINISHES BECAUSE I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE. TO THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION FOR WATER SUPPLY AND WATER QUALITY -- BY LIKE THAT. TYPE OF SPECIFICITY -- WITHIN THAT. DID YOU ENVISION OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE INTO THE CONSERVANCY'S AT ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. YEAH WE'RE NOT -- THAT'S ELIGIBLE AT AHLERS AT NOT INELIGIBLE USES TO BE SORT OF OKAY TIME BY THAT I WILL FINISH MY PLUG -- ON THAT ON THAT POINT. BUT LISTEN I APPRECIATE -- WHAT YOU'RE DOING I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS MATURE IT'S IT IT'S HARD TO SUPPORT A BOND -- ELISE FROM MY NECK OF THE WOODS UNLESS I CAN DEMONSTRATE TO THE FOLKS I REPRESENT. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE OVERLOOKED THIS TIME RIGHT. AND I WANT AND I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THAT REPRESENTATION -- THAT WE'RE GOING -- TO IMPROVE OUR LOT. IN THE REGION -- WITHOUT. THAT ARTICULATION -- IN THE BOND ITSELF IF IF THAT CAN BE PROVIDED I I I TOTALLY HEAR YOU AND I I'D LIKE TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU AND ALSO OTHER REPS FROM THE FROM CENTRAL VALLEY TO TALK SHOP ABOUT HOW WE CAN GET LANGUAGE THAT GIVES. YOU KNOW APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF FLEXIBILITY BUT BUT REALLY DOES KIND OF DRILL DOWN TO THE KIND OF CORE. ISSUES INFRASTRUCTURAL AND AND INFORMAL JUSTICE ISSUES A YEAR TRYING TO GET OUT. AND SO I'D I'D VERY MUCH LIKE TO WORK WITH WITH BOTH OF YOU AND OTHERS. OKAY WE'RE GOING OVER TO CENTER JONES AND COMMERCENTRE JACKSON. THEY SURROUND MOST OF MY CONCERNS OF ALREADY BEEN -- HANDLE IN THE CURRENT TO A CONVERSATION I I DO WANT TO SAY -- YOU KNOW AT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. AS OUTLINED I I THINK I CAN SUPPORT. ALMOST ALL OF MOST OF IT -- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE URGENCY. A AND DOING A BOND YOU KNOW JUST KIND OF PUT SOME OF THE STUFF OFF TILL YOU KNOW AFTER -- TWENTY TWENTY AS THE NEW GUY HERE AND WITH A TWO YEAR BREAK BETWEEN TWO HOUSES I'M TRYING TO GET CAUGHT UP ON THE POLICY AND BUDGET YOU KNOW PROCESS HERE. I I THINK. IF YOU KNOW OF IF WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT MOST THESE ITEMS YOU KNOW THIS CURRENT YEAR -- THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEES AND THE BUDGET COMMITTEE I THINK WE CAN GET A LOT OF IT DONE THIS YEAR. I I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS REGARDING THE BONDING AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED -- YOU KNOW BOTH GOVERNOR BROWN AND GOVERNOR'S SOME HAVE. AS BEEN SHARED YOUR CONCERN ABOUT IT UPCOMING. DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OR NOT -- BUT IF IT DOES THAT WILL IMPACT THE BONDING CAPABILITY -- AND AND I REALLY DO HAVE. IT THE LAND ACQUISITION PROCESS IN OVER -- COMPONENTS BY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I MIGHT YOU KNOW I MIGHT -- HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENT ON BUT WE CAN WORK I THINK WE CAN WE CAN WORK THAT OUT -- THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND I'M AT CURRENTLY TODAY I'M JUST KINDA UNCOMFORTABLE -- PUTTING THE STATE FURTHER IN DEBT ARE AUTHORIZING YOU KNOW FOR THE AT JUST INITIAL DAD BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LOT OF THESE CONVERSATIONS. IN ON THE CURRENT POLICY HEARING KERR BUDGET YEAR I THINK WE CAN GET SOME OF IT DONE. THE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS CENTER AND I YOU KNOW I I AS I SAY I CONCERNED ABOUT THE THE THE FINANCIAL ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN AND I MEAN ULTIMATELY THIS IS. THE BEGINNING OF A LONG CONVERSATION THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND AND WE AWARE THIS WILL FIT INTO THE LIST OF PRIORITIES AND AND I AND I DO SUPPORT MY COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS ON THAT ALL MENTIONED YOU KNOW THE SCIENCE ASPECT OF IT I I THINK THAT THAT. I THINK THAT WOULD SELL TO CALIFORNIA IN OFFICIALLY GETS APPROVED ON THE BALLOT I THINK THAT IS BE IMPORTANT PART OF THAT CONVERSATION HERE YEAH. SO I DO I I MEAN I COULD BUY IT SO THE EVERYTHING IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP AS ABSOLUTE VALID THIS THIS HOWEVER WE DO KNOW THAT THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE ARE PRICING IN REAL AN URGENT. AND LONG TERM IN. IN IN IN MADE. WITH THE BILL. HEY WE HAVE A MOTION FROM CENTER MINING CENTER JACKSON -- I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T ALSO BRING UP. THE FACT THAT -- THE BILL HAS A SECTION FOR CENTRAL VALLEY DAMS FOR BETTER FLOOD MANAGEMENT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ANY OTHER REGIONS OF THE STATE INCLUDING THE CENTRAL COAST WHICH I REPRESENT. ANDA FREQUENTLY WE FEEL TO THAT WERE SOMETIMES IGNORED FROM THE PROCESS -- SO IBM I KNOW THAT MY STAFF HAS TALKED WITH YOU ABOUT THE HOPE THAT OBSOLETE DAM REMOVAL AND RIVER ECOSYSTEM PROJECTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING. FRANKLY I HAVE A OF THE MATERIAL HOW IT'S ACTUALLY THE INTERNATIONAL SYMBOL OF OBSOLETE DAM REMOVAL MOVEMENT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THAT REMOVED -- I THINK IT WAS WHEN SECRETARY BABBITT WAS THE HEAD OF THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. OF MANY MANY YEARS AGO -- CAME UP AND SYMBOLICALLY REMOVED ONE OF THE CONCRETE. TO BORDERS AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL THE TO EVER HAPPEN. AND SO IT'S MY HOPE THAT -- THAT THIS WOULD ALSO BE -- CERTAINLY ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION IT ISN'T RIGHT NOW -- IT WILL RESTORE THE VENTURA RIVER -- IMPROVING OUR RECREATION RIVER HEALTH FISH STOCKS COASTAL HEALTH I MEAN THERE WERE A LOT OF GOOD REASONS THAT THIS MIGHT BE INCLUDED. AND IT'S ACTUALLY A VITAL. OF RESTORATION PROJECT BUT A TRUSTING AGAIN SEALEVEL RISE SO -- WOULD THIS BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO ADD TO THE BILL -- AGAIN AS ONE OF THE OPTIONS I DON'T THINK. IT'S FAIR TO JUST ASK YOU TO PUT YOU KNOW TO PUT THIS CHRISTMAS TREE OUT THERE WITH SPECIFIC -- PROJECTS BUT CERTAINLY WITHIN THE SUBJECT MATTER OF OBSOLETE DANCE I WOULD. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER THAT SO WE COULD BID FORD AND BEFORE PEOPLE. THE THE WERE ALIVE WHEN SECRETARY BABBITT WAS A SECTOR NO LONGER LIVE SO THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M REFERRING -- TO IT'S SORT OF LIKE YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY DON'T KNOW JUDY COLLINS IS I MEAN IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT SAID GENERATION. AND YES SEAT NOT ARGUING ALL FOR DON'T YOU CAN YOU CAN'T KID MAKE BUT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE COULD ALSO CONSIDER THOSE ASPECTS AS PART OF IT IS WHAT. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MY ASSESSMENT HAS FOR YEARS AND THAT THAT THAT'S THE PLAN. TO PROTECT CONVERSION OPTION. YEAH VERY GOOD. THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS BUT I APPRECIATE. THEM. YOUR DEXTERITY AND SORT OF OPENNESS TO THINKING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THIS. THIS KIND OF BOND PERFORM. BUT I DO WANT TO RESET THE CONVERSATION TO THAT. THE RISK IS STILL GOING TO BE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT THIS IS NOT EVEN GOING TO BE A DROP IN THE BUCKET COMPARED TO THE SCOPE OF THE RISKS OF THIS STATE RIGHT EVEN OVER THE LIFE OF THIS BOX. THERE A LOT OF OTHER WAYS TO PAY FOR THIS STUFF TOO WE'RE GONNA NEED ALL THOSE WAYS. THE RATE PAYERS ARE GONNA BEAR SOME OF THE RISK ON WILDFIRE. HOW MUCH CAN THEY BEAR? LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO BEAR THE COSTS OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND YOU KNOW DEALING WITH FLOODED HOMES AND TRYING TO YOU KNOW DREDGE UP UNDER BRIDGE THAT YOU CAN GET. SEVEN FLOOD YOU KNOW WATER MOVING THROUGH THERE IN A IN A IN A CRISIS AVOIDING LIABILITIES HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LIABILITIES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE FARMING COMMUNITY I MEAN IT THE LIST GOES ON I THINK. MAIN MY GOAL WOULD BE THAT. WE CONTINUE NOT JUST TO TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE MEMBERS THIS COMMITTEE -- BUT TO REALLY PUT AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK TOGETHER THAT'S GOING TO GIVE THAT SENSE OF PERFORMANCE HERE THAT I THINK. WE CAN PROBABLY FIND. A MULTI REGIONAL BI PARTISAN ANSWER HERE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO OVER INFLATE WHAT THIS IS GONNA SOLVE EITHER BECAUSE AGAIN I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN AFFORD TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM RIGHT NOW BUT A BOND. IS IT IS AN ISSUANCE OF TRUST AND IT'S SAYING THAT WE RIGHT NOW IN PRESENT DAY CAN'T AFFORD THE SCOPE OF THIS RACE BUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE A PROMISE TO THE FUTURE. THE PEOPLE LIVING CALIFORNIA SAY LIKE WE ALL COLLECTIVELY HAVE TO SOLVE THIS AND EVEN YOU KNOW YOUR SON -- WHO INDIA OF TWENTY YEARS THIRTY YEARS? I THINK SPEAKING ON HIS BEHALF IS FAIR IN THIS CASE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH. THOSE THOSE PEOPLE TO LIVE HERE CAN'T CAN'T SPEAK UP RIGHT NOW -- THAT VOICE HAS TO COME THROUGH TO SO YEAH EVERYTHING JUST BURNED OUT. MY COMMUNITY MY HOME EVERYTHING WE KNOW THAT IT'S HAPPENING EVERYWHERE AND IT'S NOT JUST FIRE IT'S PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS THE ENTIRE CULTURE THIS STATE. SO IT'S BIG -- BUT I I APPRECIATE THE THE DILIGENCE AND THE INSIDE FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HERE TO REALLY TRY TO HONE A PRODUCT HERE THAT. WE REALLY CAN BRING TO THE VOTERS THE CALIFORNIA SO I WOULD JUST ASK FIRST I WANTED I WANTED JOINT ON AND I WANT TO BE A PARTNER WITH YOU ON THIS EFFORT BUT ALSO AS THIS MOVES FORWARD. I JUST WORK OF THE COMMITTEE BUT BRING THIS BACK TO COMMITTEE AND LET US SORT OF SEE WHAT THE SECOND ROUND OF THIS PRODUCT CAN LOOK LIKE IN. LET'S LOOK FOR THAT COLLECTIVE SORT OF YEAH EQUITY STAKE IF YOU WILL. YOU OPEN TO THAT OKAY GREAT -- CONTINUED CONVERSATION THE START THANK YOU FOR THE INPUT TODAY I I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HERE -- SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION FOR SENATOR MINING AND AND THE WAY IT'S GONNA WORK WE CAN'T AMEND TODAY GIVEN THE TIMING BECAUSE YOU'RE ARE YOU TROUBLE REFERRED. TO YOUR TRIP FOR FOR SO FIRST OF MANY -- BUT WITH THE AT THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU ACCEPT I THINK WILL BE ADOPTED AN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY SO THE MOTION IS JUST TO PASS TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY -- SO WITH THAT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SORRY YES [inaudible] YES PLEASE. FORGIVE ME I DON'T KNOW SO. WITH THIS ITEM BE BROUGHT BACK -- AS YOU JUST MENTIONED BEFORE OF WAR ONCE IS REFERRED WE HAVE TO WAIT TO THE VERY END. TIMING WISE I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT -- WELL TO TO THE END OF THE PROCESS FOR ANOTHER REFERRAL BUT I THINK THE POINT IS THAT WE DO WE COMMIT TO A A SUBSTANTIVE HEARING NOT JUST A A A A SORT OF WE WOULD WE WOULD TAKE THE REFERRAL FROM RULES AND HEAR THIS AGAIN. BUT WHETHER THAT OCCURS BEFORE A FLOOR VOTE -- OR AFTER THE OTHER HOUSE -- I DON'T KNOW. AFTER THE OTHER HOUSE SO WOULD IT WOULD BE IF IF THIS WERE TO MOVE THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY WE WOULD SEE THIS BACK. OKAY SO I THINK THAT'S THE TIME IS THIS IS THE POLICY HEARING IN THIS HOUSE BUT WE WOULD CALL IT BACK FOR A POLICY HEARING IF IT MADE IT OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY. HOWEVER I DON'T I ALSO THINK BEFORE APPROPRIATIONS THE FLOOR THERE'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE CONTINUED SUBSTANCE CONVERSATION SO I'D SAY YOU KNOW WE PUT SOME KIND OF GROUP TOGETHER AND START. REALLY WORKING ON THIS BUT I THINK THAT'S THE FORMAL PROCESS. THAT IS THAT HELPFUL. AND I THINK RATING AT THE END OF TRYING TO I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND. SO WITH THE FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD AND SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE. THEY WOULD BE INCORPORATED OR YOUR PROPOSAL BE MODIFIED. OR STAY IN ITS CURRENT FORM MOVING ON TO THE NEXT TO SET OF COMMITTEES INTO ANOTHER HOUSE. I THINK JUST PROCEDURALLY -- WE'VE ACCEPTED THE COMMITMENTS FOR YOU Q. THE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. I WOULD WE EITHER GET IT IN PLACE BEFORE EACH YEAR WITH PEOPLE THE THIRD REFERRAL DO YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS WILL GO IN AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY THE CONCEPTUAL COMMITMENTS WILL OBVIOUSLY BE THERE UNTIL -- I WOULD IMAGINE APPROPRIATIONS IT'S PROBABLY THE THAT BE THAT IT'S A PRETTY COMPRESS PUREED YOU'VE GOT HERE SO I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE NEXT. VENUE OR THE POOR BEFORE THE FLOOR. WHAT MAYBE BEFORE GOVERNMENT'S FINANCIER? ABSOLUTELY YEAH ABSOLUTELY. pIMAGINING THERE'S GONNA BE A V. ONE V. TWO V. THREE THIS IS GOING TO KEEP EVOLVING HERE BUT BUT IF. YEAH ASSUMING IT PASSES YEAH. BUT I MEAN IF PUTTING I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING -- ON ON A CORPORATE IN THIS DISCUSSION INTO THE BILL AND AND EVEN IF THERE'S NOT A FORMAL HEARING OF THIS COMMITTEE. TOMORROW THAT DOESN'T STOP ANY OF US FROM WORKING TOGETHER TALKING TO EACH OTHER ABOUT ABOUT. CONGRESS HAS IN WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT INTO THE BOND THE LANGUAGE OF THE BOND -- BEFORE IT GETS OUT OF THE SENATE. SO MISTER CHAIR I I THINK JUST FOR PURPOSES OF MY STING OLLEAGUE HE'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE HIS VOTE. GOES AND HOW IT GETS RECORDED AND SO -- I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT IT -- I'M ASSUMING IT'S GONNA GET BETTER GIVEN THE COMMENTS THAT WE MADE AND SO -- THAT THAT IT'S WHY I'M A YES VOTE -- BUT I THINK THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON FOR THE FOR THE QUESTION AND YOU WILL GET ALSO A SECOND BITE AT THIS APPLE -- YOU COULD YOU DON'T SIT IN GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE THREE YOU KNOW BUT BEFORE THE BUT BEFORE THE FLOOR I MEAN. WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU TODAY IS? YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A NEW PRODUCT -- COMING FOR THE AT LEAST COMING BACK TO THE MEMBERS IS COMMITTEES TO REVIEW AND SEE IF WE'VE SORT OF MEMORIALIZE SOMEBODY'S CONCERNS AND WORK THROUGH IT. PRIOR TO A SECOND VOTE NOT A BRAND NEW PRODUCT AN IMPROVED PRODUCT NEW AND IMPROVED. IMPROVED I'LL LEAVE MY COME OF THIS I WILL I'M GOING TO STAY IN ON TODAY'S VOTE. BUT I APPLAUD YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING I WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU IN ITS FINAL PRODUCT IF IT'S WITH THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

SURE STERN AND MEMBERS I JUST WANNA PRESS OFFICE VIA THE A CONVERSATION IT -- I WILL BE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE. AND WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS AS BEFORE -- FOR WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FOR THE ACQUISITION. OF FOUR PARCELS TO EXPAND CHINO HILLS STATE PARK. DOING SO WILL CONTINUE TO PRESERVE OPEN SPACE FOR GENERATIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS ARE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE RESPITE IN THE AREA THAT ONLY. CHINO HILLS STATE PARK PROVIDES SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN THE STATE PARK AND RECREATION COMMISSION OFFICIALLY DECLARE THE ORIGINAL. TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN ACRES OF LAND A UNIT OF THE STATE PARKS SYSTEM. CHINO HILLS STATE PARK BECAME A LANDMARK THAT SITS AT THE JUNCTION OF FOUR OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST POPULOUS COUNTIES ORANGES SAN MARINO LOS ANGELES AND RIVERSIDE. TO THE EFFORT TO PRESERVE OPEN SPACE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS ARE NOW ABLE TO EXPLORE AND COME AWAY FROM CHINO STATE PARK FEELING REFRESHED AFTER YOU LIGHTING IT'S MANY TRAILS AND CAMPGROUNDS. FOR STUDENTS OF ALL AGES YOU KNOW STATE PARK ALSO SERVES AS AN IDEAL LOCATION TO LEARN. MILLION VISITORS ARE ABLE TO OBSERVE MANY WILDLIFE SPECIES NATIVE TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DUE TO THE PARKS DIVERSE HABITATS AND MICRO CLIMATES. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION THE LOCAL DIVERSITY OF NATIVE PLANTS AND ANIMALS LOCATED IN THIS AREA. IS GREATER THAN ANY OTHER AREA OF COMPARABLE SIZE IN THE UNITED STATES. ADDITIONALLY CHEN HOST THE PARK PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES TO ACHIEVE A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE DO THE ACCESS TO THE PARKS MANY TRAILS THAT ARE USED FOR MANY HEALTHY ACTIVITIES. FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ENSURE ACCESS TO OPEN SPACE FOR FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS. CHINO HILLS STATE PARK IS THE RESULT OF THIRTY FOUR ACQUISITIONS OVER THIRTY SIX YEARS BUT IT IS STILL INCOMPLETE. THE FOUR PARCELS THAT AS BEFORE -- FOR PROPOSES TO ACQUIRE WILL CONTINUE THE VISION THAT WAS SET BY THE STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT IN THEIR NINETEEN NINETY NINE GENERAL PLAN FOR CHINO HILLS. A PART. OF THOSE A PARKS DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE LAND IN THE PAST TO GROW THE SIZE -- PRESERVE OPEN SPACE IN THIS COMMUNITY THIS PROCESS OF ACQUIRING LAND HAS NOT BEEN CARRIED OUT IN YEARS. AS A COMEDIAN ALSO STATES WE BELIEVE THAT AS BEFORE FOR THE WAKE UP CALL TO THE DEPARTMENT TO BEGIN STRATEGIC PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS AGAIN. HERE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUED THE TRADITION OF PRESERVING THE WILDLIFE CORRIDOR IN THE COMMUNITY. AN OPPORTUNITY THAT HASN'T PRESENTED ITSELF FOR MANY YEARS I WILL LET MY WITNESS CLEAR SHOT A BACK SPEAK MORE ON THE DETAILS OF EACH PARCEL BUT THREE OF THE PROPOSED PROPERTIES THAT AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN ACRES. OF LAND OWNERS THAT ARE WILLING SELLERS THE STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT. AND ELEVEN ACRE PROPERTY KNOWN AS THE PT PROPERTY IS POVERTY THAT THE LANDOWNER HAS BEEN WILLING TO DONATE TO THE STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT. AND I ALSO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT AS INDICATED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT THE BILL IS NOT SEEKING APPROPRIATIONS SINCE THE LAND THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR ACQUISITION CAN BE ATTAINED. WITH FUNDS FROM OTHER SOURCES OR IN ONE CASE DONATE OUT RIGHT WE BELIEVE THAT DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO ACQUIRE AMENITIES PARCEL. IS REQUIRED AND THAT IS WHY SB FULL FORCE ABSOLUTELY NEEDED THANK YOU AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER TO MY WITNESS CLEAR SLAUGHTER BACK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HILLS FOR EVERYONE THE BILL SPONSORED. HUMANS TURNING MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE ARE GROUP FOUNDED% THIS STATE PARK FOR THIS WORK THE STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT GAVE US ITS HIGHEST HONOR THE TO WAIT AWARD IN. NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE PARK HAS BEEN THE MOST COMPLICATED SET OF ACQUISITIONS IN STATE PARK HISTORY SITTING AS IT DOES AT THE JUNCTURE OF LOS ANGELES ORANGE. SAN BERNARDINO AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES IN THE MIDST OF EIGHTEEN MILLION PEOPLE. CHINO HILLS IS ALSO ONE OF THE NEWEST STATE PARKS AND IS NOT YET FINISHED. IT WAS DESIGNED A LONG RIDGE LANE BOUNDARIES SO THAT ONCE YOU'RE INSIDE THE PARK YOU DON'T KNOW THAT ALL THOSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE ON THE OUTSIDE OF IT. IT WAS DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE WATERSHED FOR WILDLIFE AND IF YOU SHED FOR VISITORS IN PARKS START TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AFTER LITERALLY FORTY YEARS OF TRYING -- TO ACQUIRE THESE LANDS WE FINALLY HAVE WILLING SELLERS OF THE UNPROTECTED EASTERN RIDGE WIND. AMONG OTHER SOURCES WE ARE LINING UP FUNDING FROM SECTION SIX WHILE THE W. C. B. AND LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUNDS. ALL WE NEED IS STATE PARKS TO TAKE TITLE TO THE LAND IT HAS ALWAYS WANTED. WE ARE NOT ALONE IN WANTING DPR TO ONCE AGAIN. ADD PARSLEY AND THE RIVERS AND LANDS CONSERVANCY OWNS LAND THE D. P. R. PROMISED TO TURN INTO SANTA MATTEO CANYON STATE PARK OVER TWELVE YEARS AGO. IN TO BREAK GO FOUNDATION OWNS IN HOLDINGS DP ARE ONCE. IN TWO THOUSAND DPR BOUGHT LAND TO CONNECT OUR HILLS TO THE SANTA ANA MOUNTAINS WITH A WILDLIFE CROSSING UNDER THE NINETY ONE FREEWAY. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME LAND WAS BOUGHT FOR THE CONNECTIVE ITTY BY STATE PARKS. THE LA TIMES JUST REPORTED WE MAY LOSE COUGARS INTO SEVEN CALIFORNIA MOUNTAIN RANGES UNLESS WE WINK MORE LANDS. THAT NEED FOR WILDLIFE CORRIDORS IS ON GOING AND YET STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS ARE NOT I'M GOING. WE NEED DEEP YARD TO LIFT ITS COLLECTIVE HEAD FROM ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES CONSUMING IT. THE DEPARTMENT HAS UNDERGONE A DECADE LONG PROCESS OF REFORM REFORM SAID AT THIS POINT POINT FEEL MORE LIKE PENDANTS AND STARVATION. FOR THE SINS FROM LONG AGO. PLEASE HELP THE DEPARTMENT BECOME THE GREAT PARTNERS FOR SUSTAINABLE LANDSCAPES THEY ONCE WERE. BY ALLOWING THESE ACQUISITIONS TO MOVE FORWARD I URGE A YES VOTE ON THE AMENDED SB.

THE STATE BECAUSE THE CONSERVANCY'S AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE GRANTS -- FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE PROTECTING OUR STATE'S CULTURE RESOURCES BUT ALSO. AT HELPING TO IMPROVE -- BUT THE PUBLIC'S ACCESS TO THE COAST LINE ACROSS THE STATE. SINCE THE CREATION OF THE COASTAL ACT. THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY WAS CREATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF HELPING -- TO IMPROVE THE COASTLINE HELP TO ESTABLISH A TO ACQUIRE LANDS TO HELP. THE PUBLIC IT GREATER ACCESS TO TO THE COASTLINE -- THERE BEEN OZ VARIOUS RESTORATION PROJECTS MITIGATION PROJECTS -- ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION PROJECTS. BUT YOU KNOW. THE THE THE COAST CONSERVANCY'S BEEN DOING PHENOMENAL WORK ACROSS THE STATE MANY PEOPLE WILL AGREE. THAT OF THE COASTLINE IS VERY IMPORTANT -- TO TO THE STATE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT -- FOR RECREATION IT'S IMPORTANT. FOR THERE IS SOME IT'S ALSO IN A ESSENTIAL TO OUR ECONOMY. SO -- DOING MORE FOR FOR THE COAST IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT. THIS BILL WOULD IT WOULD ADD AN EDUCATIONAL ELEMENT TO THE GRANT MAKING PROCESS BECAUSE OF COURSE -- STEWARDSHIP OF OF THE COASTLINE INVOLVES THE PUB PUBLIC IT INVOLVES EVERYONE. A WE WE NEED EVERYBODY'S HELP TO BE A IT ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN HELPING TO PRESERVE PROTECT. AND AND I CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT ACCESS TO THE COASTLINE AND AND DECIDE TO EDUCATIONAL ELEMENT TO THE CONSERVANCY WHERE. GRANTS CAN BE MADE TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT. OF PROVIDE AN EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT -- THIS OF WOULD EXTEND. TO EDUCATIONAL ORG -- ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE EDUCATION TO THE PUBLIC. IT ALSO PROVIDES SUPPORT TRIBES NONPROFITS AND PUBLIC AGENCIES. WHO WORK TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC -- ABOUT -- COASTAL ACCESS AND COASTAL PROTECTION. I SB THREE SIX SEVEN WILL BUILD ON THE CONSERVANCY'S EFFORT TO INCREASE COASTAL ACCESS. AND AND IT'LL ALSO -- BY.

THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE ON THAT OR OF STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. WELL OF COURSE THE OVERSIGHT IS PROVIDED BY THE CLOSE CLOSE -- CULTURE CONSERVANCY WHICH HAS BOARD BUT THE BILL. SPECIFICALLY MENTIONS THERE'S A REFERENCE -- TO THOSE EDUCATION -- ORG DOES EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE TO PROVIDE -- EDUCATION - THAT'S CONSISTENT WHAT WHAT THE STATE'S EDUCATIONAL POLICIES. AND WITHIN. BUT THE THE STATE'S EDUCATIONAL GOALS SO THERE IS A COORDINATION WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE WITH THIS BILL.

TO BOTH -- IMPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE EXISTING PROGRAM WE KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH THROUGH THE CONSERVANCY WE THINK THEY'VE BEEN DOING A GREAT JOB. EXPANDED MISSION EDUCATION BUT STILL STAYING CONSISTENT WITH THAT BROAD MISSION OF EDUCATING ABOUT. ENVIRONMENTAL BUT ALSO INCLUDING LEADERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES AND OTHER SORT OF WAYS TO ENHANCE THAT EDUCATION I LIKE THIS SORT OF ACTION COMPONENT TO IT ALL -- AND ALLOWING ADULTS ACCESS I THINK IS ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT POINT HERE THAT. YOUTH MATTER -- BUT IF WE CAN ENGAGE A WHOLE FAMILY IN UNDERSTANDING GET WHAT ACCESS REALLY CAN MEAN TO THEM I THINK IT CHANGED PEOPLE'S LIVES SO. GRAND AMBITION FOR PRETTY SIMPLE BUILD BUT THANK YOU FOR BRING IT FORWARD WE DO HAVE A MOTION -- WITH THAT -- WOULD LIKE YOU TO CLOSE. THIS GENERALLY CALIFORNIA'S COASTLINE BELONGS TO EVERYBODY CALIFORNIA NOT JUST PEOPLE THAT LIVE ON THE COAST. WHERE THAT RESIDE ON A COASTAL CITY? IT BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE VALLEY IN THE DESERT SUN AND MOUNTAINS. AND SOMETIMES -- THAT ACCESS IS VERY DIFFICULT. AND ALLOWING -- THE CONSERVANCY TO DRAW FURTHER DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE STATE TO GET PEOPLE TO APPRECIATE THEIR CLOSE AND ALSO HAVE. NOT ONLY A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE BUT A LEARNING EXPERIENCE AND AND AND I THINK EVERYBODY IN THE STATE TO LEARN THAT THEY HAVE. A RESPONSIBILITY TO TO CARE FOR THE COAST -- IT WHEN THEY VISIT AND WHEN THEY RECREATION SO -- THIS IS -- OF A BILL THAT'S GOING TO ADD A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO COASTAL PROTECTION THROUGH EDUCATION. AS FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. VERY GOOD THANK YOU -- MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATOR STERN STERN AYE JONES [inaudible] HEY ALAN. ALLEN I FORGES CABALLERO CABALLERO AYE HERTZBERG HUESO AYE HUESO AYE JACKSON MONEY MONNING HI. AS FIVE BUT WE'LL PUT IN CLOSE FIVE VOTES WE WILL LEAVE IT ON CALL FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS. I THINK SENATOR CAFIERO YOU ARE. LAST BUT NOT LEAST. LET'S UPDATE THIS NO SURVEY. WELCOME THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US [inaudible] FOR ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE THE FARGO. VERY. EDGY HERE TO TESTIFY THIS BILL -- I WILL. OKAY OKAY AREN'T GREAT CLOSER CARRIER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FOUR EIGHTY SEVEN THE AERIAL SNOW OBSERVATORY. SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY NINE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A GLOBAL LEADER IN SNOW PACK MEASUREMENT AND MONITORING WHEN THE STATE BEGAN MEASURING SNOW VOLUMES AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THIS YEAR IN ABOUT A MOUNTAINS RUNOFF FORECAST ALLOWED US TO PLAN AND BUILD A WORLD CLASS SYSTEM OF WATER MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. THE CAPTURE CONTROL. AND DELIVER WATER RELIANT ON UNDERSTANDING ANNUAL SNOW ACCUMULATION AND MELTING AT VARIOUS WATERSHEDS. AS CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ARE COMPARTEN KEATING DEMANDS ON OUR WATER SUPPLIES ARE CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES FOR WATER MANAGEMENT HAVE LEAD TO COSTLY MISTAKES THAT WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO MAKE. WE RELEASE WATER TO MAKE SPACE FOR FLOODS THAT NEVER COME. FLOOD TO COME FASTER IN SOONER THAN EXPECTED WITH LITTLE TIME TO EVACUATE. OUT RESERVOIRS AND WE MISS OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EXCESS FLOWS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT OR GROUND WATER STORAGE. SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY SINCE. TWENTY THIRTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES HAS WORKED WITH THE COALITION OF WATER USERS ON A NOVEL PILOT PROJECT TO OBTAIN HIGHLY DETAILED DATA ABOUT OUR SIERRA SNOW PACK AND TO CREATE RUN OFF FORECAST. FOR A SELECT NUMBER OF BASINS IN THE HIGH SIERRAS. THIS PROJECT THROUGH THE AIRBORNE SNOW OBSERVATORY IS AN AERIAL SNOW MONITORING TOOL THAT PROVIDES PRECISE MEASUREMENTS OF SNOW DEPTH FOR EVERY SQUARE METER OF SNOW IN A WATERSHED. SB FORTY SEVEN PROPOSES TO EXPAND THIS PILOT PROJECT TO THE ENTIRE SIERRA SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS IN TRINITY ALPS EVERY MAJOR SNOW COVERED AREA. THE AS THE SO TECHNOLOGY USES PLAIN MOUNT MOUNTED LIDAR OR LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING TO MEASURE THE DISTANCE OF OBJECTS BELOW. THE PLANE TRAVELS ACROSS THE WATERSHED TAKING MEASUREMENTS OF THE TERRAIN AND THE SURVEYS OCCUR BEFORE THE SNOW HAS FALLEN IN AGAIN MONTHLY DURING THE WINTER AND SPRING. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEASUREMENTS AND THE SUBSEQUENT ONES DOES DETERMINES THE SNOW DEPTH IN THE WATERSHED. THEN WATER MANAGERS USE THE MEASUREMENTS TO DEVELOP ESTIMATES OF HOW MUCH WATER WILL BE IN STREAMS AND CREEKS RIVERS AND LAKES IN THE COMING DAYS. THE MEASUREMENTS FROM A SO ARE EXTREMELY PRECISE THE RUNOFF FORECAST USING A SO DATA -- BETWEEN NINETY SIX AND 99% ACCURATE TRADITIONAL SURVEYS YOU KNOW WHERE THEY SEND SOME GUY OUT THERE WITH THAT. WITH A STICK -- WHICH WHICH ARE GREAT YOU KNOW [inaudible] HAVE A HAVE HAVE A MARGIN OF ERROR OF 4260%. BECAUSE THE DATA SO SURVEYS PROVIDE IS SO HIGHLY ACCURATE IT ELIMINATES THE GUESS WORK OF RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT AND REDUCES UNNECESSARY RELEASES EFFECTIVELY ADDING SURFACE WATER STORAGE WITHOUT ANY CONSTRUCTION. IN ADDITION TO WATER SUPPLY AND FLOOD FORECASTING BENEFIT AS A ESOS SURVEYS ARE USEFUL FOR ASSESSING MANY ON THE GROUND CONDITIONS THAT SUPPORT FOREST HEALTH. FIR MANAGEMENT TRANSPORTATION AND RECREATION ALL THE THINGS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF OUR CLIMATE -- THE BOND THAT WE WERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. SB FOUR EIGHTY SEVEN PROVIDES FIFTEEN MILLION FOR SURVEY AND FORECAST DEVELOPMENT EACH YEAR OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD. IT INCLUDES THE FLIGHT THE DATA PROCESSING THE MODELING AND TO DEVELOP OF RUN OFF FORECAST FOR EVERY MAJOR SIERRA OR A DECENT BASE AND THE DRAINS INTO A LAKE A RESERVOIR. IT IS MANAGE FOR WATER SUPPLY FLOOD CONTROL OR TO SUPPORT THE ENVIRONMENT WE BELIEVE THAT TEN YEARS IS THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME NEEDED TO SEE THE FULL BENEFITS. OF FOR ALL OF THE BASINS A THIRD OF THIS YEAR AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SURVEYED AND TWO THIRDS. ARE IS PROPOSED TO BE ADDED UP FOR FULL FUNCTIONALITY WITH D. W. OURS CURRENT RUNOFF MODELING AND FORECASTING EFFORTS. WITH ME HERE TODAY TO PRESENT TESTIMONY TESTIMONY IS JEFF PAINTER LOCK IRRIGATION DISTRICT WATER POLICY DIRECTOR FRANK KIRKE RETIRED D. W. R. C. SNOW SURVEY CHIEF AND MARTHA DAVIS MONO LAKE COMMITTEE BOARD MEMBER. THANK YOU. CENTER CARRIER OPENNESS IN SUPPORT WELCOME FROM THE MOUNTAINS YOU'RE YOU'RE A LITTLE WAYS AWAY. THANK YOU I DO FEEL -- A LITTLE YLIDES IN AS OPPOSED TO BEING OUT IN THE FIELD WITH FOLKS LIKE YOU. I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THIS THIS MORNING -- SO SURVEYS WERE DEVELOPED BY DOCTOR JAMES EACH CHURCH BEGINNING IN NINETEEN OH NINE TO MAKE POSSIBLE FORECASTS OF SUBSEQUENT SPRING RUN OFF. OUR ABILITY TO FORECAST RUNOFF HAS MADE FOR MORE EFFICIENT USE OF EXISTING RESERVOIR CAPACITY. FOR BOTH WATER SUPPLY FLOOD CONTROL ENVIRONMENTAL RELEASES AND HYDROELECTRIC GENERATION. DURING SUBSEQUENT YEARS EVOLUTIONARY IMPROVEMENTS WERE MADE TO IMPROVE THEIR TIMING AND ACCURACY OF SNOW MEASUREMENTS AND RUN OFF FOR CASH. CURRENT OPERATIONAL WATER SUPPLY FORECASTING RELIES ON THESE GROUND BASED MEASUREMENTS. THE EXISTING NETWORK OF SNOW COURSES AND SNOW SENSORS IS VERY SPARSE AND CANNOT CAPTURE. THE TERRAIN AND TURN COLD -- VERY ABILITY OF SNOW ACCUMULATION AND MELT AND THEREFORE ARE ONLY AN INDEX OF THE SHOW IN A GIVEN AREA. EXISTING RUNOFF FORECASTING REALIZE EITHER ON A STATISTICAL LIKE AN INDEX METHOD OR ON A PHYSICALLY BASED MODEL RELATING VARIOUS VARIABLES TO THE SPRING RUN OFF. THE INDEX METHOD IS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE OF ITS RELATIVE SIMPLICITY BUT IT SUFFERS THE THREE DIFFICULTIES IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WELL IN VERY WET OR VERY DRY CONDITIONS. AND FURTHER MAKES THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE CLIMATE IS STATIONARY AND AGAIN WE KNOW THAT'S UNSERVED AND PROVE CHAU OUR OUR FORECASTS ARE INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT AND LESS ACCURATE THAN THEY HAD BEEN IN THE PAST. THE PHYSICALLY BASED MODEL ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE DEFICIENCIES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PRIMARY DRIVER -- FOR THE SPRING RUN OF THESE COURSES SNOW PACK AND THE FOOD THAT WE CANNOT VALIDATE WITH CURRENT TECHNIQUES THE COMPUTER VALUE OF THE MODEL. I'VE BEEN MEASURING SNOW IN CALIFORNIA FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS AND THE AIRBORNE SNOW OBSERVATORY IS A GAME CHANGER FOR SNOW PACK MEASUREMENT. AND THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT IN THE HISTORY OF SNOW SURVEYS. TO PARAPHRASE A QUOTE FROM THE MOVIE MEN IN BLACK BEFORE A A SHOW YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW ABOUT THE SNOW PACK NOW IMAGINE WHAT YOU'LL KNOW TOMORROW. IT IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD AN ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF THE TOTAL VOLUME STILL VOLUME AND DISTRIBUTION OVER A LARGE AREA. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DEFINES A QUANTITY OF RUN OFF INTO A GIVEN REG FOR WITH VERY HIGH ACCURACY. AND ALLOWS WATER MANAGERS MUCH GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN ADJUSTING THE QUALITY AT THE TIMING AND THE QUANTITY OF THEIR RELEASES. IT IS ALSO NOW POSSIBLE TO VALIDATE MODELED SNOW PACK RESULTS AND MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN OTHER MODELS FOR EXAMPLE RELATED CLIMATE CHANGE. THE AIR SO IS MUCH MORE THAN JUST ABOUT WATER SMELLING FUND CONTROL. THE DATA SETS HAVE TREMENDOUS UTILITY OVER A BROAD RANGE OF DISCIPLINES INCLUDING HABITAT STUDIES FIRE SPREAD AND A SEVERITY. VEGETATION ANALYSIS SUCH AS TREE MORTALITY TRANSPORTATION AND CLIMB AN ANALYSIS THE PROGRAM IS WORKING -- COLLABORATING WITH THE U. S. FOR SERVICE AND NATIONAL PARK SERVICE ALREADY ON PRE AND POST FIRE -- AN ANALYSIS FOR THESE WATERSHEDS. AND I'LL BE HAPPY AT THE END TO ENSURE A QUESTIONS MAY HAVE. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE FOR HEARING US TODAY MY NAME'S JEFF PAIN I'M THE DIRECTOR OF WATER POLICY FOR THE FRONT WATER AUTHORITY -- A SO IS -- JUST ECHO FRANCE REMARKS HERE VERY QUICKLY VERY VERY EXCITING TECHNOLOGY IT'S LIKE GOING FROM RAIN GAUGES TO RADAR FOR SNOW MEASUREMENT. AND I'M SPEAKING HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF A CONSORTIUM OF OUR USERS IT'S BEEN GROWING I'VE GOT A BROCHURE HERE THAT I HAVE COPIES OF THIS PORTION OF THE HEARING ABOUT IT THAT'S IN YELLOW HIGHLIGHTED HERE. IS IT'S FROM THE WALL ME ALL THE WAY DOWN THE KOREA IS CURRENTLY BEING SURVEYED THIS YEAR. AND THAT INCLUDES WATER USERS THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO -- AND FROM AGRICULTURAL LANDS FROM MERCED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO BAKERSFIELD -- THE WATER MANAGERS SHARE SEVERAL CHALLENGES IN THIS AREA AND STATEWIDE -- THEY NEED TO BALANCE THE RISK OF FLOOD CONTROL WITH WATER SUPPLY AND ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS -- PARTICULARLY ON THE SAN JOAQUIN FOR THE THE FRIEND VISION WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RESTORATION PROGRAM ON SAN JOAQUIN RIVER -- PARTICULAR FOR FRANK DIVISION WERE LOOKING CONJUNCTIVE MANAGEMENT AND ARE THE TRYING TO VISION WAS DEVELOPED TO TAKE EPISODIC FLOWS OFF OF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER. AND RECHARGE GROUNDWATER AND I WAS A DESIGN THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES. AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH SNOW THERE IS AND WHEN IT'S RUNNING OFF. AND TO DO THAT WITH ADDITIONAL BURDENS OF YOU KNOW. SIGMA IMPLEMENTATION -- WITH RESTORATION AND TRYING TO MANAGE THAT WATER SUPPLIES WE HAVE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT MORE EFFECTIVELY. IT'S CREATING AS A SYSTEM IN WHICH THE X. EXPENSIVE MISTAKES OF TAKING A CONSERVATIVE APPROACH UNDER WATER SUPPLY. LOSES BIG OPPORTUNITIES. AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF ANECDOTES THAT WE'VE ALREADY -- COLLECTED THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE TALL ME WAS THE FIRST WATERSHED OUT OF THE GATE. TO SEE THIS IMPLEMENTED SO THEY'VE GOT SEVEN YEARS OF PRACTICE. THIS TECHNOLOGY'S COMPLETELY BAKED INTO HOW THEY'RE DOING WATER MANAGEMENT TODAY. AND LAST YEAR AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS SO SAVED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET FROM BEING SPILT THEIR WARES AND ENCOURAGEMENT INTO THE FLOOD POCKET. AND THEY WERE BEING ASKED AT DAWN PETER TO EVACUATE THAT WATER SENT DOWN THE RIVER AND MAKE SPACE FOR MORE RAIN. WITH A SO THEY KNEW HOW MUCH WATER WAS ON THE GROUND THEY KNEW THAT THERE'S NO WAY IF IT ALL MELTED THAT THEY WOULD SPILL A DROP. AND THEY COULD SEE THAT THERE WEREN'T ANY ATMOSPHERE COVERS ON THE HORIZON THEY WERE COMPELLED TO SHARE THAT AND THEY WERE ABLE TO SAVE THAT WATER THAT'S WATER THAT THAT GOES INTO GROUND WATER NOW. AND KEEPS THE VALLEY PRODUCTIVE -- ON THE FRIEND SYSTEM WE INVESTED IN AND TRYING TO GET A A SO INTO THE SAN JOAQUIN OUT OF THE TWELVE AS A FIRST STEP BECAUSE WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DROUGHT. AND WE WERE HAVING ALLOCATIONS THAT WERE 10% BELOW WHAT THEY ULTIMATELY COULD HAVE BEEN. AND IT'S IMPORTANT 10% IN A CRITICAL DROUGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE FOLLOWING LAND OR YOU'RE DOING UNNECESSARY GROUNDWATER PUMPING IN A DRY YEAR WHEN YOU COULD HAVE HAD THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW MUCH SNOW THAT WS ON THE GROUND. SO THIS IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT DRY. WHAT YEAR AVERAGE YEAR PRODUCES OPPORTUNITIES TO MANAGE OUR WATER RESOURCES A A LOT BETTER -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- I'LL JUST ADD THAT AID IT ADDS A SOME CONFIDENCE AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT -- THIS YEAR I WAS JUST SPEAKING WITH WATER MASS FROM THE KINGS RIVER. AND HE WAS SAYING THAT THE THE NEW SERVICE THAT WE ARE JUST GETTING OUT OVER EMAIL THIS WEEK HAVE GIVEN HIM THE CONFIDENCE TO BE ABLE TO RELEASE FLOOD CONTROL IN A MORE MODERATED -- MANNER RIGHT NOW SO HE'S MAKING ADDITIONAL RELEASES WITH THE CONFIDENCE THAT THE RESERVOIR WILL REFUND LATER AND THAT THIS IS GOING TO AVOID A SURPRISE LATER IN THE SEASON. AND THE SURPRISES ARE EXPENSIVE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE YOU END UP WITH THESE MODULATED POLLS FLOWS THAT ARE ARE SOMETIMES DESTRUCTIVE TO HABITAT YOU'RE TRYING. TO TO RESTORE THANK YOU. THANKS SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY THE DAVIS BOARD MEMBER FOR THE MONO LAKE COMMITTEE IN THE VERY LONG DISTANT PAST. IT WAS ALSO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. BUT WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT IN CONCEPT ON THIS BILL WE'RE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ON SOME MINOR TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPLAINED THE TECHNOLOGY I THINK VERY WELL IN MANY OF THE USES. SO. I JUST WANT TO TESTIFY AS A USER OF THE STATE -- WE WILL MODEL LIKE COMMITTEE WAS INCLUDED VERY EARLY ON AS PART OF TESTING THE DATA AND ITS ACCURACY. AND IN ONE WORD THIS TECHNOLOGY IS TRANSFORMATIONAL. IT IS INCREDIBLY ACCURATE BUT PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF IT IS FIGURING OUT THE TIMING OF WHEN THE WATER IS COMING DOWN. SO WE CAN PROACTIVELY MANAGE FOR MULTIPLE PURPOSES SO IT IS WATER MANAGEMENT BUT IT'S ALSO RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ITS ECOSYSTEM PROTECTION RESTORATION WERE USING AT ALL AND THAT'S THAT OUR EXPERIENCE WITH IN THE MONO BASIN. I THINK AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE ONE WILL UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT ONLY MAKING THE SUMMARY OF THE DATA AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC BUT THE DATA ITSELF. SO IT SHOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF AB SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE AS WE LOOK AT THIS DATA. THIS IS THE FOUNDATIONAL DATA FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE WE CAN'T MANAGE WHAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. AND THIS DATA PROVIDES AS CLOSE TO REAL TIME WATER DATA UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS TO REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE NOT JUST FOR WATER AND RESOURCES BUT ACROSS THE BREADTH. OF RESOURCE ISSUES THAT ARE COMMUNITIES ARE FACING -- WITH CLIMATE CHANGE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH HOW DID INTRODUCED AND OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MORNING MR CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE WHEN THE RIVER BUSH WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES ARE AQUA IT'S FANTASTIC TO SEE PROACTIVE WATER DISTRICTS. REALLY TRYING TO BETTER MANAGE -- THE SUPPLY AND WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT ALL THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX WATER CONSERVATION RECYCLING EXCEPT TRACK. THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE VERY IMPORTANT TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX THANK. ADAM ROBIN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. GARY LANGER DUCKS UNLIMITED WE ARE A WETLANDS BASED ORGANIZATION OVER HALF OF OUR STAFF OR WEAPONS BIOLOGISTS WE'VE FUND WITHOUT WATER WE DON'T HAVE WETLANDS NERD WITH WATER FILE. PRINT CHIU SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. GOOD MORNING JOSH WEIMER WITH THE TURLOCK IRRIGATION DISTRICT AND STRONG SUPPORTER AND WE REALLY THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CANDIDATE JOGO WITH WALK A GROUP ON BEHALF THE MODESTO IRRIGATION DISTRICT AND THE KINGS RIVER WATER CESSATION ALSO IN SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THING OTHERS IN SUPPORT THOSE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE MEMBERS QUESTIONS COME. RUNNING [inaudible] THERE JONES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD CLEARLY. THE OBJECTIVES ARE SOUND IN MY QUESTION JUST GOES TO THE IN THE ANALYSIS. IT SEEKING. A COMMITMENT OF FUNDING FOR OVER TEN YEARS -- IN IT LOOKS LIKE IT PENCILS OUT FIFTEEN MILLION A YEAR FOR TEN YEARS. DO YOU KNOW OFFHAND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE CONTRACT WITH NASA OR WHOEVER'S DOING THE THE AERIAL SURVEILLANCE. WELL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE THAT CURRENTLY WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IS ALL OF THAT -- WELL I WOULD EXPECT THAT IT WILL. ALL OF IT WOULD WOULD COME FROM ALL OF IT WOULD BE PART OF THE CONTRACT BUT MAYBE. MAYBE WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CURRENT CONTRACT WE CAN. THE MAJORITY THE COST WOULD BE FOR THE AERIAL SURVEYS THAT WHICH COULD BE CONDUCTED BY AT NASA OR A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR. IN ITS ITS ADMINISTERED THROUGH DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IS THAT CORRECT IN SO THERE'S THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE DATA -- GOING UP AND I THINK FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF A COMMITMENT OF THE TEN YEAR FUNDING -- WHAT'S THE TRANSPARENCY ON HOW THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY SPENT. IN TERMS OF THOSE CONTRACTS WITH NASA I ASSUME OR YES I'D LIKE RECORD. COM I WOULD I WOULD EXPECT WE'D HAVE FULL TRANSPARENCY IF THAT'S NOT CLEAR IN THE BILL WE CAN MAKE IT. WE CAN MAKE THAT CLEAR IN ADDITION TO ANY -- OVERHEAD THAT MIGHT BE. OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO LIMIT THE OVERHEAD TO AND I I ALSO WANT TO JUST BE UNDERSTOOD I UNDERSTAND THE BENEFIT OFTEN OF LONG TERM. COMMITMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONTRACTING AND THAT HOPE IF THIS COMMITMENT IS MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE. HE COULD ALSO RESULT IN PERHAPS SOME MORE NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE WITH NASSER WHOEVER THE CONTRACTOR IS -- TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT LONGER TERM COMMITMENT IN A SINGLE BUDGET YEAR. YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT I MY UNDERSTANDING. FROM. FROM PAST WORK THAT I'VE DONE IS THAT -- NASA -- DOES SIGNIFICANT AERIAL. ANALYSIS -- RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS NOT ONLY ON SNOW PACK BUT ALSO IN VEGETATION -- PARTICULARLY AS THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THE DEAD AND DYING TREES -- THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT MAPPING AND SO I I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY ECONOMIES OF SCALE THERE. BUT AT LEAST FOR THIS PURPOSE WE'VE PUT IT AB APPROXIMATE AMOUNT BASED ON THE PAST CONTRACTS AND I I DO EXPECT THAT THERE WOULD BE EFFICIENCIES AT SOME POINT BUT THANK YOU AGAIN I AM SUPPORTIVE TODAY I WOULD ALSO THINK. IF NECESSARY BOB MAYBE WE APPROACH OUR FEDERAL CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION SEE IF THEY WANNA CHIP INTO THIS IMPORTANT EFFORT AS WELL. THANK YOU. OKAY SIR MONNING VICE CHAIR WELL ON ON THAT NOTE RIGHT INTO QUESTIONS ONE FOR THE OTHER ONE FOR FRANK -- ON THE FUNDING HAVE YOU CONSIDERED LOOKING AT CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS RATHER THAN GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. HI A WE'VE TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES -- AND FRANKLY THAT'S A DISCUSSION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN TERMS OF WHERE THE RESOURCES MIGHT BE BEST. I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING A LOOKING INTO AS WELL THEN ON FRANK YOU MENTION A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WHERE THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN HELPFUL. WHAT -- HOW MANY YEARS AND HAVE YOU BEEN OR HAS THIS BEEN USED IN THE AREAS IT'S ALREADY BEING USED? A GOOD QUESTION IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORT FOR AT LEAST SEVEN YEARS IT WAS STARTED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WITH OUR FIRST WINTER SURVEYS. AND SO THE TWO WITH ONLY THIS PHONE ME AND BEGINNING -- THIS WILL BE THE THIRD YEAR FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM AND SO IT'S THIS YEAR THAT WE'RE JUST STARTING TO GET THE MODELS. UP AND RUNNING FROM THE THE SERVICE AND THE EXPERIENCE SO FAR HAS BEEN THAT THE MODELS THAT THE THAT THE ANALYSIS PREDICTS ACTUALLY. AT AND THEY'RE PLAYING OUT. VERY CLOSER EXACTLY HOW THE MODEL SAYS ARE GONNA. GO AT THE THE THE QUANTITY OF SNOW THAT IS IS CAPTURED ON THE GROUND IS THE 96298% SO THE TOTAL RUNOFF FOR THE YEAR IN APRIL CAN BE. ESTIMATED ON APRIL FIRST. AS LONG AS YOU'RE NEGLECTING FUTURE RAINFALL MUTE YOU'LL NEVER GET THAT CRITICAL. WHAT INSPIRED MY QUESTIONS YOU SAID THAT THE THE -- AN ACT AND I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I I'M JUST TRYING TO GET US SOME MORE BACKGROUND ON IT I GUESS. THE THE KERN RIVER I'VE MANAGER YOU SAID IS. HOLDING BACK A RELEASE BASED ON THE ANALYSIS THAT HE'S RECEIVING RIGHT NOW SO. NOT THAT EXAMPLE BUT ARE THERE OTHER EXAMPLES WHERE THEY WERE SOMEBODY MADE A DECISION. AND THE MODELING WAS INACCURATE I GUESS IS KIND OF WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS. YEAH I I MEAN I THINK THE EXAMPLE -- THAT THAT WE SAW ON THE THE TALL ME IS THE MOST INSTRUCTIVE BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE BEING TOLD BY FLOOD CONTROL CURBS SO FLOOD CONTROL CURVE IS SORT OF AN ENGINEERS APPROXIMATION OF YOUR RISK OF FUTURE RAINFALL. AND THE RISK OF FUTURE SNOW MALCOLM OCCURRING SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THEN OVERTOPPING YOUR RESERVOIR. SO THEY'VE GOT A STATISTICAL MODEL BUT IF YOU CAN ACTUALLY. COUNT ALL THE WATER MOLECULES ON THE GROUND. ON EVERY SQUARE METER OF EARTH AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S NO ATMOSPHERIC RIVER COMING. THEN YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR RISK IS THERE'S NO MORE STATISTICAL GUESSWORK. AND SO IS THE STATISTICAL ADVANCE FOR QUESTIONS AT THAT YEAH NO I THINK YOU DID AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT THAT IS ONE THE REASONS WHY I'M SUPPORTING IT BECAUSE IT'S THE ACCURACY SEEMS TO BE. RIGHT ON SPOT SO -- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN. I MEAN TO OUR EARLIER CONVERSATION TRYING. TO I GUESS GET THE DATA PART OF THIS PUZZLE SORTED OUT IN A MORE ACCURATE WAYS WE CAN ACTUALLY SCOPE [inaudible] THE NEED. DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT SAVINGS THIS KIND OF THE ACT TO INCREASE ACCURACY COULD YIELD DO YOU HAVE ANY I MEAN YOU MENTION A 10%. SORT OF FALL SHORTFALL IN OTHER WORDS THAT WAS. BUILT IN BUT ARE THERE ANY OTHER WAYS TO PUT TOGETHER ESTIMATES HERE [inaudible] SORT OF COST OVER TIME -- I OVER TIME. I MEAN THERE'S AVOIDED COSTS FOR FLOOD RISK WHICH I I MEAN ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE I MEAN THE WHOLE SNOW SURVEY PROGRAM. WAS BUILT ON RESOLVING FLOOD RISK RIGHT SO -- BUT THE ADDITIONAL COSTS OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU WOULD FOR GONE IS THE WAY THAT I WOULD CALCULATE IT FOR A A WATER MANAGEMENT ENTITY SO A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET. ON ON THE TWELVE MAY I MEAN WHAT'S WHAT'S THAT WORTH WHAT'S THAT WORTH IN A DRY YEAR -- THAT'S THAT'S THE VALUE THAT WE'RE JUST GETTING AND YOU CAN GET THOSE PULSES. JUST EVERY SINGLE YEAR WHAT IS IT WITH AND I I'D I'M NOT CERTAIN BUT THAT WOULD BE FOR THE ENTIRE STATE WE HAVE NOT ESTIMATED THAT [inaudible] I KNOW. YEAH MOTION ON THE BILL -- WE'LL KEEP MOVING THIS ALONG -- THIS IS THE PROPER APPROPRIATIONS GONNA DIVE SEE DRILL DEEPER IN THE COST AND SOME IS GONNA BE A FUNCTION OF GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIES DID DID OF YOURS PRIORITIES. WHAT HAPPENS IN CONGRESS HOPEFULLY THEY STAB GUIDING THE BUDGET ON DOING JUST BASIC SCIENCE RESEARCH THAT I KEEP HEARING MORE AND MORE ABOUT? CUTTING CUTTING CUTTING AROUND MONITORING IN BASIC -- SATELLITE DATA SO THAT'S A PROBLEM BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BEFORE THIS HITS THE FLOOR TO PAY OUT BECAUSE IN APPROPRIATIONS JUST A BETTER SENSE OF YOU KNOW WE MAKE A CONTINUOUS PREPARATION FOR A DECADE THAT'S A BIG. THAT'S A BIG GIVE SO EXACTLY WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BE GETTING FOR OUR MONEY OVER TIME AND I THINK THERE'S A CASE TO MAKE HERE ABOUT IT. AS A SORT OF SAVINGS BASED INVESTMENT AGAIN BUT I'D LOVE MORE DETAIL ON THAT AS WE GO ON BY THE WAY NOT JUST IN THE AGRICULTURAL SIDE BUT YOU LOOK AT THE POWER SIDE OF THINGS AND IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ARE FLOWS ARE GOING TO BE HYDRO POWER. WE DON'T KNOW -- WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE WE MAY HAVE TO FIRE UP GAS PLANTS OR IMPORT POWER FROM OUT OF STATE SO? THIS ALL MATTERS ANY HOW WE DO HAVE A MOTION -- BUT ARE YOU UP FOR SORT OF A DEEPER DIVE THERE AND JUST KEEP WORKING WITH US ON THAT HE'S OKAY SELECT EVERY GREAT THANK YOU -- YOU CAN MAKE YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU'D LIKE. COM THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE ROBUST BRO BUS DISCUSSION WE'VE TAKEN NOTES ON ON THINGS TO FOLLOW UP ON I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS GIVES US -- COULD SCIENCE DATA UPON WHICH WE CAN BOMB. PROTECT NOT ONLY ARE RISK OUR FLOOD CONTROL RISK BUT ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY BE ABLE TO USE THIS WATER IN A WAY THAT'S MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE COST. IF YOU KNOW IF YOU REALLY GET INTO IT YOU CAN LOOK AT THE COST OF RELEASING WATER -- AHEAD OF TIME AND NOT USING IT IN A WAY THAT'S THE MOST PRODUCTIVE EITHER -- TO TAKE CARE FAMILIES OR TO TO GROW OUR OUR PRODUCE AND SO THIS GIVES US DATA TO BE ABLE TO TO MEET MEET AS MANY NEEDS AS POSSIBLE AND AS WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO CONSERVE WE ALSO NEED. TO CONSERVE OUR STORAGE. WELL THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATE STERN STERN AYE JONES. JONES I ALLEN.
