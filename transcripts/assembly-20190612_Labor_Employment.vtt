00:38:32.209 --> 00:38:33.144
SAYS.

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:34.345
THAT YOU CAN HAVE A CONTRACT

TO CHANGE THE TENURE OF A THE UC

00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:26.257
REGENTS WHICH I CONSIDERED A

00:40:26.323 --> 00:40:27.825
REAL PROBLEM.

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:29.727
LOOK THAT THEY CAN OUTLAST THREE

00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:34.431
GOVERNORS INTO LEGISLATURE'S.

00:40:34.498 --> 00:40:35.666
ONLY KINGS QUEENS AND DICTATORS

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:36.600
HAVE THAT MUCH.

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:39.270
TENURE IN THE WORLD.

00:40:39.336 --> 00:40:40.905
AND SO THEY CAN IGNORE US.

00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:42.239
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE TO COME

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:43.607
BACK TO US.

00:40:43.674 --> 00:40:44.909
THE TALK WITH HIS DAVID DONE IT

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:46.777
IN THE PAST.

00:40:46.844 --> 00:40:49.613
THAT PARTY UC REGENTS.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.447
I WORK FOR THE CITY OF LOS

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:51.882
ANGELES FOR FOR TWENTY FIVE

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:54.418
YEARS.

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:55.653
I WORK FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES I

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:56.987
WAS WERE WITH. ONE SEVEN BROUGHT

00:40:57.054 --> 00:41:00.224
IN. NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN WE DID

00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:02.493
A MUCH BETTER JOB.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.128
THEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR NINE

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:05.963
TIMES OUT OF TEN AFTER YOU

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.364
HIGHER TO MAKE THE LOWER COSTS

00:41:07.431 --> 00:41:09.567
WITH THE CHANGE ORDERS AND THE

00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:11.435
OTHER THINGS THAT CAME IN LATER.

00:41:11.502 --> 00:41:12.903
AFTER FIVE TEN YEARS YOU'RE

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.471
PAYING MORE THAN YOU DID WITH

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:16.106
THE PUBLIC SECTOR.

00:41:16.173 --> 00:41:18.976
BUT THAT'S NEVER INCORPORATED.

00:41:19.043 --> 00:41:20.010
AND MY POINT IT SHOULD BE ME BUT

00:41:20.077 --> 00:41:21.478
THERE'S NEVER INCORPORATED IN

00:41:21.545 --> 00:41:22.947
THE ANALYSIS IS USUALLY AT THE

00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:24.715
FRONT END THIS IS HOW MUCH WE

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:25.816
SAFE.

00:41:25.883 --> 00:41:27.451
BUT NO ONE EVER DOES AN ANALYSIS

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:29.453
OF HOW MUCH THEY ULTIMATELY

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.888
SPENT ON THE BACK IN.

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:32.122
BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY WE'RE NOT

00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:33.424
VERY GOOD AT WRITING CONTRACTS

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:35.059
AND WE HAVE TO DO CHANGE ORDERS

00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:36.594
ALL THE TIME I I USED TO WRITE

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.762
CONTRACTS I KNOW I WOULD ALWAYS

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:39.997
THAT GOOD.

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:40.898
AND SO THE TAXPAYER ENDS UP

00:41:40.965 --> 00:41:43.200
PAYING MORE WHEN THEY HAD THE

00:41:43.267 --> 00:41:45.870
BEST GROUP WORKING FOR AT THAT

00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:47.338
TIME DOING THE WORK.

00:41:47.404 --> 00:41:49.440
AND EXPERIENCE PEOPLE DOING THE

00:41:49.506 --> 00:41:51.442
WORK AND SO I I KNOW ONLY

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:52.343
COMMEND YOU BUT SOME OF THE

00:41:52.409 --> 00:41:54.011
THINGS THAT THEY BROUGHT UP I'M

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:54.812
GLAD.

00:41:54.879 --> 00:41:56.580
ESPECIALLY THE PART ABOUT COMING

00:41:56.647 --> 00:41:58.682
BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE

00:41:58.749 --> 00:42:00.751
NO GOVERNMENTAL BODY.

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:02.186
SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUST.

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:04.955
RUN AMOK AND NOT HAVE ANY

00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:06.857
OVERSIGHT TECHNICALLY THEY HAVE

00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:09.360
NO OVERSIGHT AT THE BORDER

00:42:09.426 --> 00:42:11.028
REGIONS AND THEY CAN JUST DO

00:42:11.095 --> 00:42:11.862
ANYTHING THEY WANT.

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:13.731
AND I WISH WE HAD ADDED THAT HIT

00:42:13.797 --> 00:42:15.599
TO YOUR BILL THAT WE WOULD GIVE

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:16.967
THEM FOUR YEAR TERMS.

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:18.369
SO THEY WOULD LEARN.

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:21.872
HOW? TO TO LISTEN TO OTHER

00:42:21.939 --> 00:42:23.374
PEOPLE AND TAKING THEIR INPUT

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.276
AND NOT JUST DO WHATEVER THEY

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:28.245
FELT THEY WANTED TO DO AND SO I

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:30.347
I WILL BE A YES.

00:42:30.414 --> 00:42:31.181
YES AND YES.

00:42:31.248 --> 00:42:32.516
I APPRECIATE THAT AND I AM I

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:33.784
THINK IF WE ADDED THAT INTO THIS

00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:35.219
WE MIGHT VIOLATE THE SINGLE

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:37.221
SUBJECT ROLE THAT I'M WOULD BE

00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:39.223
HAPPY TO WORK ON THAT WITH YOU

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:41.926
IN A SEPARATE ACA I THINK THAT'S

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:44.194
AN IMPORTANT FEATURE.

00:42:44.261 --> 00:42:46.230
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS --

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:47.898
I WHAT I WANT TO ALSO THANK THE

00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:50.067
AUTHOR -- AND YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:51.302
CLEARLY BUT WHEN IT COMES TO

00:42:51.368 --> 00:42:52.202
SOME OF THE SPECIFIC ISSUES

00:42:52.269 --> 00:42:53.837
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS.

00:42:53.904 --> 00:42:56.073
LIKE THAT -- IN SOME CASES CAN

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.741
GET WORKED OUT AS BILLS GO FORTY

00:42:57.808 --> 00:43:00.277
SENATORS ON THE DETAILS I'M SURE

00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:01.312
IT'LL BE APPROPRIATELY BETTER AT

00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:02.413
THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE -- WHEN

00:43:02.479 --> 00:43:05.783
THAT TIME COMES -- I I WILL ALSO

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:07.017
SAY THAT WHEN IT COMES TO

00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:08.018
HEALTHCARE COMPETITIVENESS I

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:09.453
AGREE WE HAVE TO DO MORE ON COST

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.354
CONTAINMENT IN GENERAL IN OUR

00:43:10.421 --> 00:43:11.922
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO MAKE.

00:43:11.989 --> 00:43:12.957
OUR PUBLIC SYSTEMS MORE

00:43:13.023 --> 00:43:14.224
COMPETITIVE AND I THINK THAT

00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:15.292
THAT'S ONE AREA THAT WE'RE GONNA

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:16.994
CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON AND IT ALSO

00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:18.262
AGREED WITH THE SAME NUMBER.

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:20.564
JONES SAWYER MY EXPERIENCE ON

THE CITY OF SAN JOSE WHEN.

00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:24.335
WE LOST A LOT OF PUBLIC WORKERS

00:43:24.401 --> 00:43:30.074
AND WE OUTSOURCE A LOT OF OUR ON

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:30.641
THAT NOT ONLY WILL BE PAYING

00:43:30.708 --> 00:43:31.875
MORE -- BUT WE WERE GETTING LESS

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:32.776
OUT OF IT AND THAT WERE THAT

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:33.344

PRIVATE CONTRACTOR.

00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:35.813

00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:37.448
OF AMER PRIMER USING.

00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:38.949

THAT WE ASK EMPLOYERS TO HIM.

00:45:57.287 --> 00:45:58.856
LOOK AT THIS THERE'S ONE RIGHT

00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:00.491
HERE THAT'S OUTLINED IN RED THAT

00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:02.059

00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:02.993
PROTECTED.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.329
IT IS THE PUBLIC POLICY OF THE

00:46:05.395 --> 00:46:07.164

AND I SHARE THAT WITH YOU

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:16.106

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:24.314
BASIC ELEMENTS.

00:46:24.381 --> 00:46:25.582
AND SO A COUPLE YEARS AGO I WAS

00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:27.151
HERE SETTING UP A PROCESS AND

00:46:27.217 --> 00:46:29.653
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE FOUND OUT

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.555
