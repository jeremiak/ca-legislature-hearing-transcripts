WE ALSO. SHARE A GOAL OF

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:30.245
ENSURING THAT AT SMALL

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:30.845

WOULD INTERFERE WITH THAT

01:22:57.572 --> 01:22:59.341
HOWEVER. I THINK IT WOULD BE

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:01.142
WISE TO DOUBLE CHECK THAT AS WE

01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:03.311

PROFESSOR ALSO- IT'S MY

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.088

02:23:11.115 --> 02:23:12.583
IT A DIFFERENT PRESCRIPTION

02:23:12.650 --> 02:23:14.552
ARM. NUMBER ONE I THINK THE

02:23:14.619 --> 02:23:17.322
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS MAKE USE

02:23:17.388 --> 02:23:19.324
OF THE I. BANK SO WE'RE- IT IS

02:23:19.390 --> 02:23:20.792
CORRECT THAT I PROPOSED A

02:23:20.858 --> 02:23:22.460
DIFFERENT ENTITY BUT NOW WE'RE

02:23:22.527 --> 02:23:24.395
ROLLING IT INTO FIFTEEN

02:23:24.462 --> 02:23:27.966
ADMINISTRATOR FROM HER- WHICH I

02:23:28.032 --> 02:23:29.867
BELIEVE FURTHERS EFFICIENCY AND

02:23:29.934 --> 02:23:31.803
HELP SOMEONE TO KNOW GENERALLY

02:23:31.869 --> 02:23:33.805
HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS. I THINK

02:23:33.871 --> 02:23:35.907
THE QUESTION BECOMES THE-

02:23:35.974 --> 02:23:38.843
ECONOMIC STRAITS THE THIRD

02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:40.578
RURAL COUNTIES ARE IN MAY MAKE

02:23:40.645 --> 02:23:42.013
IT HARDER FOR THEM TO BRING THE

02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:44.115
RESOURCES OF THE TABLE TO

02:23:44.182 --> 02:23:46.351
COMPLETE PROJECTS. SO I THINK

02:23:46.417 --> 02:23:49.854
IT IS FAIR TO LOOK AT WHAT ARE

02:23:49.921 --> 02:23:53.424
THE TYPICAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF

02:23:53.491 --> 02:23:55.193
STATIC OR DECLINING POPULATION

02:23:55.259 --> 02:23:57.895
COUNTIES- RESOURCE BASED

02:23:57.962 --> 02:23:59.364
ECONOMIES ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT

02:23:59.430 --> 02:24:01.065
SET UP THE BILL WOULD SORT OF

02:24:01.132 --> 02:24:03.868
CHARACTERISTIC OF THOSE. AW

02:24:03.935 --> 02:24:04.702
THAT THEY MAY BE HAVING

02:24:04.769 --> 02:24:12.777
DIFFICULTY ARE I KNOW- HERE IN

02:24:12.844 --> 02:24:14.145
SACRAMENTO COUNTY WHICH IS NOT

02:24:14.212 --> 02:24:16.047
ONE OF THESE GUYS PUT HERE

02:24:16.114 --> 02:24:17.982
SECOND COUNTY IN HERALD. THE

02:24:18.049 --> 02:24:19.484
CAREER FAIR WHICH IS A FORM

02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:20.418
COMMITTEE IN THE SOUTHERN PART

02:24:20.485 --> 02:24:24.288
OF THE- COUNTY- I. HAD FOR MANY

02:24:24.355 --> 02:24:27.992
YEARS MET IN A HERALD BAR. THE

02:24:28.059 --> 02:24:29.727
HERALD BARNES STARTED OUT AS A

02:24:29.794 --> 02:24:32.163
POLE BARN. JUST PUT A PULL

02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:34.365
CORRECTIVE STRUCTURE. LATE IN

02:24:34.432 --> 02:24:37.101
ITS LIFE THEY PUT IN A CONCRETE

02:24:37.168 --> 02:24:39.804
PAD SO THAT HAD A FLOOR. BUT

02:24:39.871 --> 02:24:40.371
IT'S AGENTS SORT OF FALLING

02:24:40.438 --> 02:24:42.907
APART. AND IT'S NOT EVEN WELL

02:24:42.974 --> 02:24:44.375
ADAPTED TO HOW DO YOU UPDATE A

02:24:44.442 --> 02:24:48.179
POLE BARN- SO I THINK THAT

02:24:48.246 --> 02:24:49.514
THERE THIS STAND FOR THE IDEA

02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:51.616
THAT. THERE CAN BE FACILITIES

02:24:51.682 --> 02:24:54.585
WHICH HAVE PLAYED A VITAL ROLE

02:24:54.652 --> 02:24:55.119
TO CREATE A LIFE WHICH ARE

02:24:55.186 --> 02:24:56.988
AGING AND FALLING APART. AND

02:24:57.055 --> 02:24:58.856
THE ABILITY OF SMALLER

02:24:58.923 --> 02:25:00.191
COMMUNITIES WITH THE KIND OF

02:25:00.258 --> 02:25:02.527
POPULATIONS FOR HOW TO. FINANCE

02:25:02.593 --> 02:25:04.429
THOSE SORTS OF THINGS IT'S

02:25:04.495 --> 02:25:05.797
DIFFERENT THAN A MAJOR URBAN

02:25:05.863 --> 02:25:07.465
AREA WHERE YOU CAN PUT TOGETHER

02:25:07.532 --> 02:25:11.436
A LOT OF RESOURCES. ON CERTIFY

02:25:11.502 --> 02:25:12.804
I ACTUALLY DO BELIEVE THAT

02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:14.806
THERE IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:25:14.872 --> 02:25:17.175
GETTING THEIR FAIR SHARE. BUT

02:25:17.241 --> 02:25:17.742
THE UNDERLYING ECONOMICS OF

02:25:17.809 --> 02:25:20.278
THEIR- COMMUNITIES MAKE IT

02:25:20.344 --> 02:25:22.814
HARDER TO FINANCE SOME OF THESE

02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:26.951
THINGS. SO I THINK IT'S JUST A-

02:25:27.018 --> 02:25:28.953
IT IS WHAT I THINK OF AS A

02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:30.688
CLASS OF SPECIAL STATUTE TO

02:25:30.755 --> 02:25:33.558
LOOK AND SAY IS THERE ARE SOME

02:25:33.624 --> 02:25:34.125
IDENTIFIABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN

02:25:34.192 --> 02:25:36.394
OUR STATE. BACK THEN WILL BE IN

02:25:36.461 --> 02:25:38.896
A CALIFORNIANS. THAT WE CAN

02:25:38.963 --> 02:25:42.667
FASHION A PLAN. OF UNDER THE

02:25:42.733 --> 02:25:44.735
AYE BANK APPROACH. THEY WILL

02:25:44.802 --> 02:25:46.003
HAVE TO DOCUMENT WHAT THE NEED

02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:48.406
IS WHAT THE PROGRAM IS HOW THEY

02:25:48.473 --> 02:25:51.476
PLAN TO. OUR FULFILL THE NEED

02:25:51.542 --> 02:25:52.176
IN THE COURTS OF THE STATUTES

02:25:52.243 --> 02:25:54.178
PURPOSES SO THERE WILL BE A

02:25:54.245 --> 02:25:56.147
STATE ADMINISTRATOR TO ENSURE

02:25:56.214 --> 02:25:58.015
THAT THE DOLLARS ARE PROPERLY

02:25:58.082 --> 02:26:00.685
APPLIED. BUT IT IS KIND OF

02:26:00.751 --> 02:26:02.987
SAYING THAT THERE'S- A VERY

02:26:03.054 --> 02:26:05.022
RURAL AREA AND OUR STATE MAY

02:26:05.089 --> 02:26:06.958
HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS. AT

02:26:07.024 --> 02:26:08.626
DIFFERENT RESOURCES TO MEET

02:26:08.693 --> 02:26:10.795
THOSE NEEDS. IT'S ALSO VALID

02:26:10.862 --> 02:26:12.663
FOR THE RISKS INVOLVED I

02:26:12.730 --> 02:26:15.032
SURVIVE SERVICES TWO THOUSAND

02:26:15.099 --> 02:26:15.833
SEVEN ON THE STATE SIDE OF

02:26:15.900 --> 02:26:16.868
STATE TO COMMISSION FOR

02:26:16.934 --> 02:26:19.070
SEVERITY OF THE ALL THE STATE'S

02:26:19.137 --> 02:26:20.605
CITIES DOLLARS A MEMBER. AND IN

02:26:20.671 --> 02:26:21.939
THE PARLANCE OF DISASTER

02:26:22.006 --> 02:26:23.674
RESPONSE YOU'RE SEEING NOW.

02:26:23.741 --> 02:26:25.209
MORE DISCUSSION OF WATER

02:26:25.276 --> 02:26:28.946
ALLUDED TO AS LILY PADS. SMALL

02:26:29.013 --> 02:26:30.047
SPOTS WITHIN A BROADER

02:26:30.114 --> 02:26:31.849
EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU KNOW WHEN

02:26:31.916 --> 02:26:33.851
A DISASTER PEOPLE CAN CONVERGE.

02:26:33.918 --> 02:26:35.753
I THINK THE LILY PAD MODEL IS

02:26:35.820 --> 02:26:37.421
ALSO IN THE BACK OF MY MIND ON

02:26:37.488 --> 02:26:38.890
THE DISASTER RESPONSE PIECE

02:26:38.956 --> 02:26:41.592
HERE. ON YOU KNOW WHEN INTO

02:26:41.659 --> 02:26:43.194
PARADISE FIRE A LARGE CHRISTIAN

02:26:43.261 --> 02:26:44.762
MISSIONARY ALLIANCE CHURCH IN

02:26:44.829 --> 02:26:46.797
PARADISE SERVED AS A STAGING

02:26:46.864 --> 02:26:48.699
AREA. BECAUSE IT WAS A BIG

02:26:48.766 --> 02:26:50.368
BUILDING WITH A HUGE PARKING

02:26:50.434 --> 02:26:52.270
LOT. WAS KIND OF SAFE. RIGHT I

02:26:52.336 --> 02:26:53.471
JUST THINK THEY HAVE PARTICULAR

02:26:53.538 --> 02:26:55.473
CHALLENGES THIS BILL WILL HELP

02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:58.809
THEM START TO MEET. AND IF YOU

02:26:58.876 --> 02:26:59.644
WERE PITCHING A SPELL SAY NOT

02:26:59.710 --> 02:27:02.580
TO. FIVE URBAN OR SUBURBAN

02:27:02.647 --> 02:27:04.682
LEGISLATORS BETTER URBAN OR

02:27:04.749 --> 02:27:06.851
SUBURBAN TAX PAYERS IS THE

02:27:06.918 --> 02:27:09.921
PITCH TO THEM THAT WE NEED TO

02:27:09.987 --> 02:27:14.325
INVEST A INCREASE SHARE. IN

02:27:14.392 --> 02:27:15.826
INFRASTRUCTURE AND IN RURAL

02:27:15.893 --> 02:27:16.694
COUNTIES BECAUSE THERE'S SOME

02:27:16.761 --> 02:27:19.397
COMPELLING STATEWIDE INTEREST

02:27:19.463 --> 02:27:21.165
FOR DOING SO OR YEAH ABSOLUTELY

02:27:21.232 --> 02:27:23.301
I THINK WE ARE ONE STATE I

02:27:23.367 --> 02:27:25.403
THINK IT IS A BI PARTISAN MOVE

02:27:25.469 --> 02:27:26.170
ITS GOVERNING FOR THE WHOLE

02:27:26.237 --> 02:27:28.673
STATE. FIVE AND INCREASE YOUR

02:27:28.739 --> 02:27:30.208
ATTENTION IDEA BECAUSE ACTUALLY

02:27:30.274 --> 02:27:31.609
COMPARED TO WHAT WE SPEND ON

02:27:31.676 --> 02:27:33.377
THE ENTIRETY OF THE STATE. IT

02:27:33.444 --> 02:27:37.281
IS DE MINIMUS YOU KNOW IT TO BE

02:27:37.348 --> 02:27:38.983
NOT EVEN A PERCENTAGE POINT.

02:27:39.050 --> 02:27:42.753
IT'LL BE SO MINOR. AND YET IT

02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:45.156
WOULD MEET A TERRIFIC NEED AND

02:27:45.223 --> 02:27:49.594
DONNA I THINK LONG TERM IT. I

02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:51.429
RELATED TO MY CITY OF RANCHO

02:27:51.495 --> 02:27:53.831
CORDOVA WE HAD A VERY ROUGH

02:27:53.898 --> 02:27:56.367
ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD. ARE IN

02:27:56.434 --> 02:27:58.002
RANGE OF OVER THE KIDS ACTUALLY

02:27:58.069 --> 02:28:01.372
REFERRED TO AS A GET OUT. AW

02:28:01.439 --> 02:28:04.075
AND ONE OF THE STRATEGIC THINGS

02:28:04.141 --> 02:28:06.644
WE DID WAS WE BOUGHT SOME LAND.

02:28:06.711 --> 02:28:09.480
BUILT HOUSING FOR VULNERABLE

02:28:09.547 --> 02:28:11.949
SENIORS ON THE SAME BLOCK AS

02:28:12.016 --> 02:28:15.386
SOME OF THE OTHER. BAD STUFF

02:28:15.453 --> 02:28:17.655
AND THAT PUBLIC INVESTMENT

02:28:17.722 --> 02:28:20.157
ACTUALLY RELEASED ENERGY NEARBY.

02:28:20.224 --> 02:28:22.059
AND SO YOU SORT OF GET THE FLY

02:28:22.126 --> 02:28:23.828
WHEEL SPINNING WHEN YU PUT

02:28:23.894 --> 02:28:24.695
SOME PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND INTO

02:28:24.762 --> 02:28:27.131
AN AREA AND I THINK IN THE SAME

02:28:27.198 --> 02:28:29.734
WAY AND RURAL AREAS OF THE

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:31.736
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORTING

02:28:31.802 --> 02:28:33.971
NEEDED FACILITIES IMPROVEMENTS

02:28:34.038 --> 02:28:35.506
TO SUPPORT OUR POPULATIONS

02:28:35.573 --> 02:28:37.875
AREAS. IT'S YOU KNOW THERE ARE

02:28:37.942 --> 02:28:40.811
PART OF OUR STATE. AND IF THIS

02:28:40.878 --> 02:28:43.748
IS A TOOL WELL ADAPTED TO HELP

02:28:43.814 --> 02:28:44.282
THEM MEET THEIR NEEDS AND

02:28:44.348 --> 02:28:47.952
SUPPORT THEIR- COPULATION. THEN

02:28:48.019 --> 02:28:49.353
IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T MATTER THAT

02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:50.521
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT TOOL

02:28:50.588 --> 02:28:52.690
THAT WE TYPICALLY DO. YOU KNOW

02:28:52.757 --> 02:28:55.493
MOST OF OUR BIG URBAN COUNTIES

02:28:55.559 --> 02:28:56.827
THEY HAVE LOTS OF STREAMS OF

02:28:56.894 --> 02:28:58.029
RESOURCES YOU CAN SORT OF PUT

02:28:58.095 --> 02:28:59.530
TOGETHER AND AGENCIES PEOPLE

02:28:59.597 --> 02:29:01.966

DIFFERENT PEOPLE KIND OF. PUT A

02:29:08.072 --> 02:29:10.107
SHORT OF THE WHEEL BUT I DON'T

02:29:10.174 --> 02:29:11.342
THINK THOSE RESOURCES. ARE

02:29:11.409 --> 02:29:16.047
COMMON IN THESE AREAS AND SORTS

02:29:16.113 --> 02:29:16.614
A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT

02:29:16.681 --> 02:29:18.783
