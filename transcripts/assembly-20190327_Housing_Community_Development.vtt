THESE PEOPLE.

00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:56.833
OR HOW TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM SO

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.169
THIS BILL WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN

00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:00.937
STARTING US DOWN THAT PATH.

00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:02.272
THE ISSUES ARE CAUSED BY NO

00:54:02.339 --> 00:54:04.741

YEARS HOW TO REMOVE THOSE LEGAL

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:13.516
OWNERS FROM TITLE -- OR SALES

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:15.251
JUST OUTRIGHT SALES WITH BAD

00:54:15.318 --> 00:54:17.420
TITLE THE RESULTS ARE HOMEOWNERS

THEIR HOMES POSSIBLY BEING

00:54:21.191 --> 00:54:22.525
TERMINATED IF PARK OWNERS --

00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:24.127
WERE TO USE THAT TO SAY YOU'RE

00:54:24.194 --> 00:54:25.261
NOT.

00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:27.430
A PROPER TITLE HOLDER SO YOU

00:54:27.497 --> 00:54:29.299
CAN'T STAY IN THE PARK AND AND

00:54:29.366 --> 00:54:31.368
IN MANY CASES NOT BEING ABLE TO

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:33.603
GET PERMITS FROM H. C. D. TO DO.

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.905
NECESSARY REPAIRS IN CALIFORNIA

00:54:35.972 --> 00:54:37.507
THERE'S TWO WAYS OF REGISTERING

00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:40.543
HOMES I. L. T. AND L. P. T..

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:42.545
I. L. T. IS IN LIEU OF TAX WHICH

00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:45.115
IS PAID BY A REGISTRATION FEE TO

00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:46.716
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING H. C. D..

00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:49.252
L. P. T. IS LOCAL PROPERTY TAX

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:50.687
PAID TO THE COUNTIES.

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:52.922
THE BREAKDOWN IS APPROXIMATELY

00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:55.058
60% OF THE HOMES ON I. L. T. AND

00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:56.426
40% OF THE HOMES.

00:54:56.493 --> 00:54:58.828
ON L. P. T. ACCORDING TO H. C.

00:54:58.895 --> 00:54:59.729
D..

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:01.197
SO AS WE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED

00:55:01.264 --> 00:55:02.298
IN THESE FIRST THREE YEARS WE

00:55:02.365 --> 00:55:03.900
CAN SEE THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:05.168
SUCCESSFUL.

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:08.038
AT THE L. P. T. LEVEL WE HAVE

00:55:08.104 --> 00:55:08.838
THIRTY EIGHT OF FIFTY TWO

00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:10.740
COUNTIES REPORTING SUCCESSFUL

00:55:10.807 --> 00:55:13.843
APPLICATIONS. TWO HUNDRED AND

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:15.612
SEVENTY FOUR OF THE EIGHTEEN

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:16.046
HUNDRED A SUCCESSFUL

00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:17.747
APPLICATIONS WERE AT THE COUNTY

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:18.682
LEVEL.

00:55:18.748 --> 00:55:20.750
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS

00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:23.486
IN DOLLAR SAVINGS 15% OF THE

00:55:23.553 --> 00:55:25.388
APPLICATIONS THAT COUNTY LEVEL

00:55:25.455 --> 00:55:27.857
RESULTED IN 62% OF THE COST

00:55:27.924 --> 00:55:28.758
SAVINGS.

00:55:28.825 --> 00:55:30.427
SO THE L. P. T. IS ACTUALLY HAVE

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:33.596
YOUR WAITED IN TERMS OF THE

00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:35.465
DOLLAR AMOUNTS -- SO I THINK

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:36.499
THAT'S YOU KNOW VERY IMPORTANT

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:37.467
WE'VE WE'VE ASSISTED AS MUCH AS

00:55:37.534 --> 00:55:39.836
WE CAN WITH THE PENETRATION AND

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:41.271
THE OUT REACH OF THE PROGRAM.

00:55:41.337 --> 00:55:42.806
HAVING MORE USED TO DO THAT I

00:55:42.872 --> 00:55:44.340
THINK WOULD EVEN ACCELERATE THE

00:55:44.407 --> 00:55:47.343
SUCCESS ESPECIALLY WITH MINORITY.

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:48.578
UNITY IS WHERE FOLKS NOT

00:55:48.645 --> 00:55:49.813
UNDERSTANDING ENGLISH FOR HAVING

00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:51.214
MORE TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING THE

00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:52.716
ISSUE.

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:01.209
PARK INDUSTRY.

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:02.911
FOR CLOSE TO TWENTY YEARS I HAVE

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.989
AND DURING MY EXPERIENCE THE

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:16.324
PAST TWENTY YEARS -- I'VE

01:18:16.391 --> 01:18:19.327
OPERATED PARKS FROM IN.

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:20.295
OH SEVEN HARRIS FIRES THAT WERE

IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEAR THE

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:23.665
SAN DIEGO.

01:18:23.732 --> 01:18:26.601
AREA -- I'VE HAD PARKS OPERATING

01:18:26.668 --> 01:18:28.403
IN THE SAN JOSE A COUPLE YEARS

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:30.872
BACK WHEN WE HAD THE FLOODS --

01:18:30.939 --> 01:18:32.374
WE HAD A PROPERTY THAT -- HAD

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:33.842
DAMAGE -- FROM THE SANTA ROSA

THROUGH THE AMERICAN CANYON

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:39.614
EARTHQUAKES.

01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:42.150
I ALSO AM A SURVIVOR OF THE

NINETEEN NINETY FOUR NORTHRIDGE

01:18:42.851 --> 01:18:44.753
EARTHQUAKE MINE WAS THE BUILDING

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.721
THAT COLLAPSED.

01:18:46.788 --> 01:18:49.057
SO IS THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:50.759
AND EDUCATION IS SOMETHING THAT

01:18:50.826 --> 01:18:52.327
IS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ME I

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:53.628
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE I

01:18:53.695 --> 01:18:54.663
DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN HERE

01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:56.331
DIMINISHES THE IMPORTANCE.

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:57.599
OF THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS

01:18:57.666 --> 01:19:00.035
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF RECENT

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:01.570
EVENTS JUST THE ONES THAT I'VE

01:19:01.636 --> 01:19:03.405
MENTIONED -- THE PARADISE FIRE

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:04.739
SO.

01:19:04.806 --> 01:19:06.842
MY COMMENTS ARE NOT TO DIMINISH

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:09.344
THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN LIFE.

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:13.048
AND AS THE BILL STANDS.

01:19:13.115 --> 01:19:14.483
WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE SMOKE

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:16.585
ALARMSI THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:18.120
I THINK THAT THE LANGUAGE COULD

01:19:18.186 --> 01:19:19.387
USE SOME FINE TUNING.

01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:20.722
BUT IN GENERAL THE VALUE OF

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:22.390
HUMAN LIFE YOU KNOW WHAT TO HAVE

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:23.458
SMOKE DETECTORS I THINK IT'S

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:24.693
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

01:19:24.759 --> 01:19:27.229
WHERE I HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:29.498
AGAIN IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO

01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:30.332
TO VOICE SOME CONCERN ESPECIALLY

01:19:30.398 --> 01:19:31.733
SINCE PEOPLE PUT SUCH GREAT

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.301
EFFORT AND WORK INTO MAKING A

01:19:33.368 --> 01:19:34.569
BETTER PRODUCT?

01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:37.172
IS AS IT COMES.

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:40.242
TO THE ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES I

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:42.110
DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:43.612
THIS CURRENT BILL THAT'S BEING

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:45.580
PROPOSED MAKES ANY REAL CHANGE

01:19:45.647 --> 01:19:47.149
IN THE OUTCOME AND THE REASON I

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:48.383
SAY THIS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE AN

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:50.919
OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE HINDSIGHT

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:52.287
OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY AGREES THE

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:53.922
PARADISE FIRES WERE TERRIBLE THE

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:56.191
SANTA ROSA FIRES WHICH I'M GOING.

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:57.526
TO USE MORE AS AN EXAMPLE

01:19:57.592 --> 01:19:58.860
BECAUSE WE HAD PARKS WE WERE

01:19:58.927 --> 01:20:00.195
OPERATING AT THAT TIME IN THAT

01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:01.263
AREA.

01:20:01.329 --> 01:20:04.166
GIVES US HINDSIGHT WE KNOW THAT

01:20:04.232 --> 01:20:06.234
WHEN THE FIRE WAS NEAR THAT

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:08.670
LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME IN.

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:09.738
AND THEY DID BASICALLY WHAT I

01:20:09.804 --> 01:20:11.606
CALL A SOFT WARNING YOU KNOW

01:20:11.673 --> 01:20:12.974
WHAT WE RECOMMENDED THAT YOU

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:15.210
EVACUATE WE DO ALSO KNOW THAT

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:17.946
SHORTLY THEREAFTER THE WINDS

01:20:18.013 --> 01:20:19.047
TOOK A HORRIBLE TURN.

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:20.949
AND THE FIRE PRETTY MUCH PUT

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:23.718
SANTA ROSA ON FIRE AT THAT TIME

01:20:23.785 --> 01:20:25.820
EMERGENCY PERSONNEL.

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:26.955
WHAT IT WAS A FIRE DEPARTMENT

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:27.822
POLICE DEPARTMENT WHOEVER WAS

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:29.257
AVAILABLE WENT THROUGH THE

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:31.293
COMMUNITY AND BASICALLY SET GET

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:32.027
OUT?

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:33.828
YOU HAVE TO EVACUATE NOW THE

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:35.964
FIRE IS COMING.

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:38.099
AND WE CAN'T STOP IT.

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.401
THAT WAS DONE IN ENGLISH

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:40.969
EVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD THAT AND

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:42.470
THEY GOT OUT I'D LIKE TO STRESS

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:44.906
ALSO THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN

01:20:44.973 --> 01:20:46.441
PLACE.

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:48.143
WHICH WAS BASED OFF OF THE

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:49.177
PREVIOUS BILL.

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:50.445
NUMBER TWO PREPARE TO SLANT IN

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:52.480
PLACE IT'S A FORTY TWO ALL

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:53.748
RESIDENTS AT ANY TIME WHEN THEY

01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:55.283
WANT THEY WANTED BUT IT'S ALSO

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:56.418
AFFORDED ANNUALLY.

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:57.819
IT'S POSTED IN THE COMMUNITY

01:20:57.886 --> 01:20:58.987
SOMEWHERE VISIBLE THAT THEY CAN

01:20:59.054 --> 01:21:01.022
GET TO IT ANY TIMES IT'S NOT

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:02.224
LOCKED AWAY IN AN OFFICE IT'S

01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:03.825
ALWAYS READILY AVAILABLE.

01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:05.460
SO WE HAVE THE HEINZ LIKE TO

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:07.062
TAKE A LOOK BACK AND SAY WHAT WE

01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:09.331
HAVE IN PLACE WORKED.

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:11.199
MY CONCERNED WITH THE ADDITIONAL

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:15.470
LANGUAGES IN AGAIN IT TAKES US

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:17.472
AWAY FROM THE THE EMERGENCY

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:18.373
PREPAREDNESS PLAN IS THAT WE'RE

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.007
GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TRANSLATE

01:21:19.074 --> 01:21:19.241
IT NOW.

01:21:19.307 --> 01:21:19.874
I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME

01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:21.543
BACK AND FORTH AS FAR WELL WHAT

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:23.044
WE MAY JUST HAVE A CERTAIN

01:21:23.111 --> 01:21:25.380
PORTION TRANSLATED THAT'S MORE

01:21:25.447 --> 01:21:25.847
UNIFORM.

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:28.550
THERE WHILE PROXIMATE LEE WHAT

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:29.150
FORTY ONE HUNDRED MOBILE HOME

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:30.752
PARKS.

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:32.087
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:21:32.153 --> 01:21:34.589
CHANCES ARE YOU HAVE FORTY ONE

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:35.557
HUNDRED EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:36.358
PLANS.

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:38.026
EVERY PARK OPERATOR.

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:39.961
HAS THE BASIS OF WHAT'S SUPPOSED

01:21:40.028 --> 01:21:42.397
TO BE USED BUT SOME LIKE THE

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:43.298
COMPANY I WORK.

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:44.399
FOR PROVIDE A LOT MORE

01:21:44.466 --> 01:21:46.034
INFORMATION SO OUR DOCKING COULD

01:21:46.101 --> 01:21:47.969
BE FORTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE

01:21:48.036 --> 01:21:49.404
PAGES LONG.

01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:51.006
WE PROVIDE EVERYTHING IN ENGLISH

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:52.540
ENGLISH IS THE PURPOSE FOR THAT

01:21:52.607 --> 01:21:54.943
IS BECAUSE I CAN WRITE SOMETHING

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:56.344
UP AND I COULD TELL YOU WHAT MY

01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:58.013
INTENT AND WHAT IT MEANS.

01:21:58.079 --> 01:21:59.247
THE MORE MOVIES ARE GOING TO

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:01.082
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:02.684
A PERSON LIVING IN A COMMUNITY

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:04.886
COULD REASONABLY EXPECT WHY ARE

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:06.621
WE STOPPING HERE WHY ARE YOU

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:08.356
THAT PROVIDING ALL THESE OTHER.

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:10.558
DOCUMENTS IN THAT LANGUAGE.

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:12.727
THAT THAT IS A VERY BIG CONCERN

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:13.361
FOR US THAT IT'S A VALID POINT

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:14.863
THAT COULD BE MADE IT'S ONE OF

01:22:14.929 --> 01:22:16.131
THE REASONS WE DON'T DO.

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:17.232
WE HAVE FOR THEM THE OPPORTUNITY

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:18.933
TO TAKE ANY OF OUR DOCUMENTS AND

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.402
HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED ON THEIR

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:22.203
OWN BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT

01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:24.673
RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY.

01:22:24.739 --> 01:22:29.110
OF IT -- I'VE I HAVE ANOTHER

01:22:29.177 --> 01:22:30.879
CONCERN AS TO HOW EXACTLY IS

01:22:30.945 --> 01:22:32.080
THIS GOING TO BE MANAGED

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:33.782
OBVIOUSLY THE STATE TAKING THE

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:35.183
RESPONSIBILITY IS A GREAT.

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:37.619
BUT AS I UNDERSTAND EIGHT CD

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:39.054
WOULD BE ACCEPTING THIS ROLE WE

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.822
JUST HAD A BILL THAT WAS BEING

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:42.157
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER.

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:43.825
WHERE WE UNDERSTAND EIGHTY HAS A

01:22:43.892 --> 01:22:46.094
VERY DIFFICULT JOB TO DO THEY

01:22:46.161 --> 01:22:47.629
HAVE A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:49.564
AND WHENEVER SOMETHING NEW IS

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:50.498
CREATED IT'S KIND OF COOL WOULD

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:51.466
JUST GIVE IT TO A CD?

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:53.001
I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THE

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:54.269
MEMBERS HERE HAVE EVER TRIED TO

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:56.071
CALL EIGHT CD OR DO A TITLE

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:57.739
TRANSFER THOSE THINGS TAKE A

01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:59.207
VERY LONG TIME SO.

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:00.942
IN GENERAL I HAVE.

01:23:01.009 --> 01:23:02.711
A LOT OF CONCERN AS TO THE

01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:04.913
TRANSLATION PROCESS IF IT'S ONLY

01:23:04.979 --> 01:23:06.047
A PORTION.

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:07.982
IT IS VERY REASONABLE TO EXPECT

01:23:08.049 --> 01:23:09.784
THAT A MEMBER OF OUR COMMITTEE

01:23:09.851 --> 01:23:10.919
COME BACK AND SAY WELL.

01:23:10.985 --> 01:23:12.520
WHY ARE YOU ONLY TRANSLATING

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:14.289
THIS PORTION FOR US WHY ARE YOU

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:16.891
NOT TRANSLATING THE REST OF THE

01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:17.692
DOCUMENT?

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:19.961
I I SPEAK SPANISH I CAN READ

01:23:20.028 --> 01:23:21.963
SPANISH BUT IF SOMEONE SENT ME A

01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:23.164
DOCUMENT ASSISTED WE GOT THIS

01:23:23.231 --> 01:23:24.632
TRANSLATED FOR YOU AND IT'S IN

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:26.234
VIETNAMESE.

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:27.802
I HAVE NO IDEA.

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:28.937
WHETHER THAT'S BEING DONE

01:23:29.003 --> 01:23:30.505
CORRECTLY BUT I DO KNOW THAT AS

01:23:30.572 --> 01:23:31.806
AN OPERATOR WE'RE GONNA BE HELD

01:23:31.873 --> 01:23:33.274
TO A BAR.

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:35.377
THIS SAYS EVERYTHING THAT'S HERE.

01:23:35.443 --> 01:23:37.278
YES FROM THE PARK IT'S BEEN

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:39.414
REPRESENTED AS WHAT IT IS SO IT

01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:40.949
PRESENTS A LOGISTICAL ISSUES

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:42.317
JUST IN.

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:44.452
GENERAL THE OTHER CONCERN I HAVE

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:46.688
IN READING THE BILL IS.

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:48.089
IT'S ONLY LIMITED TO OUR

01:23:48.156 --> 01:23:50.225
INDUSTRY MOBILE HOME PARKS.

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:52.360
AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AS

01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:54.295
A LAYPERSON I'M NOT A LOBBYIST

01:31:13.467 --> 01:31:14.669
THAT.

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:16.938

KNOW THAT -- THE CONVERSATION

01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:21.676
THAT THE AUTHORS HAVING WITH THE

01:31:23.444 --> 01:31:25.179
THAT MOST EFFECTIVELY AND

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:26.948
EFFICIENTLY I APPRECIATE THAT

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:31.452
ESSENTIALLY.

01:31:31.519 --> 01:31:33.421
WHAT WE PROPOSED WAS FOR THE

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:35.590
COMMON ELEMENTS OF ALL OF THESE

01:31:35.656 --> 01:31:37.258

01:44:58.625 --> 01:44:59.960
YOU'RE GOING A DIFFERENT WAY

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:01.294
THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S ASK.

01:45:01.361 --> 01:45:02.763
FOR WELL THIS -- THIS IS A BILL

01:45:02.829 --> 01:45:04.598
THAT WE ORIGINALLY HAD PROPOSED

01:45:04.665 --> 01:45:06.433
IN DECEMBER BEFORE -- THE

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.434
GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED HIS BUDGET

01:45:07.501 --> 01:45:10.537
AND I THINK CERTAINLY THE NEED

01:45:10.604 --> 01:45:11.605
UP AND DOWN THE INCOME SCALE IS --

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:13.840
IS IS VERY INTENSE AND WHAT

01:45:13.907 --> 01:45:15.809
MISTER GORE IS REFERRING TO IS A

01:45:15.876 --> 01:45:17.210
MISTER NEWSOME IN HIS BUDGET

01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:19.079
PROPOSAL -- PROPOSE THAT A

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:20.914
PORTION OF THE TAX CREDIT -- BE

01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:23.083
FOCUSED ON MORE MODERATE INCOME

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:25.352
HOUSING SO ABOVE LOW AND VERY

01:45:25.419 --> 01:45:27.020
LOW AN EXTREMELY LOW INCOME

01:45:27.087 --> 01:45:29.089
HOUSEHOLDS -- THE GOVERNOR

01:45:29.156 --> 01:45:30.357
ACTUALLY IN HIS BUDGET PROPOSAL

01:45:30.424 --> 01:45:32.993
NOT ONLY PROPOSES MORE MODERATE

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:34.594
INCOME ASPECTS OF THE TAX CREDIT

01:45:34.661 --> 01:45:36.063
BUT HE ALSO I THINK.

01:45:36.129 --> 01:45:36.830
HAD ANOTHER HALF A BILLION

01:45:36.897 --> 01:45:38.498
DOLLARS THAT HE PROPOSED THAT

01:45:38.565 --> 01:45:40.434
ALSO GO TO MODERATE INCOME

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:41.635
HOUSING AND SO.

01:45:41.702 --> 01:45:43.103
WE ARE HAVING DISCUSSIONS RIGHT

01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:45.105
NOW ON EXACTLY WHAT ARE THE BEST

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:46.606
LOVERS TO USE BOTH TO ADDRESS

01:45:46.673 --> 01:45:47.541
THE NEED.

01:45:47.607 --> 01:45:49.509
AT LOWER INCOME LEVELS AS WELL

01:45:49.576 --> 01:45:51.244
AS IN THE MODERATE INCOME SIDE --

01:45:51.311 --> 01:45:52.379
AND THAT DISCUSSION IS ON GOING

01:45:52.446 --> 01:45:54.414
SO I THINK FOR NOW WE LIKE THE

01:45:54.481 --> 01:45:56.116
PROPOSAL TO CONTINUE AS IT IS

01:45:56.183 --> 01:45:58.018
BUT WE'LL SEE HOW THIS INVOLVES --

01:45:58.085 --> 01:45:59.453
IN THE COMING MONTHS.

01:45:59.519 --> 01:46:00.520
I APPRECIATED OPEN THIS MEANS I

01:46:00.587 --> 01:46:01.788
THINK OBVIOUSLY TAXPAYERS

01:46:01.855 --> 01:46:03.623
SUBSIDY SHOULD GO TO THE LOWEST

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:04.925
INCOME PEOPLE WILL KNOW

01:46:04.991 --> 01:46:06.626
PRESUMABLY HOPEFULLY -- OF FOLKS

01:46:06.693 --> 01:46:07.761
WHO WORK FULL TIME DON'T NEED

01:46:07.828 --> 01:46:09.663
PUBLIC SUBSIDY IN ORDER TO MAKE

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:10.497
ENDS MEET THAT'S NOT SO THE

01:46:10.564 --> 01:46:12.365
REALITY IN CALIFORNIA TODAY --

01:46:12.432 --> 01:46:14.000
I'M SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY I

01:46:14.067 --> 01:46:15.502
HOPE THIS CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS

01:46:15.569 --> 01:46:16.870
ABOUT THAT -- MIDDLE INCOME

01:46:16.937 --> 01:46:18.305
HOUSING I CERTAINLY WHEN I GET

01:46:18.371 --> 01:46:19.639
THE MOST -- FEEDBACK ABOUT IN

01:46:19.706 --> 01:46:21.441
TERMS OF MY CONSTITUENCY -- AND

01:46:21.508 --> 01:46:22.976
WHETHER THAT IS -- REGULATORY

01:46:23.043 --> 01:46:24.745
REFORM OR OTHER THINGS OF THAT

01:46:24.811 --> 01:46:25.846
SORT OF A PRIME THE PUMP UP THE

01:46:25.912 --> 01:46:27.214
MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING AGAIN

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:28.448
THAT'S NOT SUBSIDIZED I THINK

01:46:28.515 --> 01:46:29.516
THAT'S PHILOSOPHICALLY WHY I

01:46:29.583 --> 01:46:30.117
PREFER TO SEE.

01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:31.485
I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT WE

01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:32.686
INCREASINGLY SEE THE NEED TO

01:46:32.753 --> 01:46:40.393
SUBSIDIZE UP 210020% YEAH I MEAN

01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:40.627
INCOME.

01:46:40.694 --> 01:46:42.829
AND THERE'S PROBABLY WATCH TWO

01:46:42.896 --> 01:46:43.797
REASONS IT OR OF LONGER TERM

01:46:43.864 --> 01:46:44.698
PLACES WE NEED DO IN THE SHORT

01:46:44.765 --> 01:46:45.866
TERM -- YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT'S

01:46:45.932 --> 01:46:47.100
SOMETHING THAT'S ADDITIONAL

01:46:47.167 --> 01:46:47.701
DISCUSSION AND APPRECIATE THE

01:46:47.768 --> 01:46:48.769
CHAIRS WILLINGNESS TO HAVE THAT

01:46:48.835 --> 01:46:50.270
CONVERSATIONS THE PORCINE

01:46:50.337 --> 01:46:52.105
HARDENS UP -- AS WE BECAUSE OF

01:46:52.172 --> 01:46:53.039
THE TALENTS THAT PROCESS THANK

01:46:53.106 --> 01:46:56.209
YOU MISTER THANK YOU I'LL JUST

01:46:56.276 --> 01:46:57.177
MENTION TWO OTHER THINGS.

01:46:57.244 --> 01:46:58.612
WHEN IT COMES TO TRADITIONAL FOR

01:46:58.678 --> 01:46:59.646
WHAT HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAMS --

01:46:59.713 --> 01:47:00.514
FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS --

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:01.581
THAT TAX MATCH IS THERE WHERE

01:47:01.648 --> 01:47:03.216
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THERE --

01:47:03.283 --> 01:47:04.050
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING

01:47:04.117 --> 01:47:07.888
TO MATCH THAT 1810020% A MIND SO --

01:47:07.954 --> 01:47:11.158
THE DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND -- FOR

01:47:11.224 --> 01:47:13.360
FOR THAT RANGE GOES FARTHER AND

01:47:13.426 --> 01:47:14.661
SO THAT IS ANOTHER REASON WHY WE

01:47:14.728 --> 01:47:15.762
WANTED TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION

01:47:15.829 --> 01:47:17.063
BUT THAT BEING SAID.

01:47:17.130 --> 01:47:18.431
I THINK THERE IS A VERY VALID

01:47:18.498 --> 01:47:19.833
CONVERSATION WE NEED TO HAVE ON

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:21.101
THE SO CALLED MISSING MIDDLE --

01:47:21.168 --> 01:47:22.369
YOU AND I ARE WORKING TOGETHER

01:47:22.435 --> 01:47:24.571
ANOTHER BILL THAT WE WILL BE

01:47:24.638 --> 01:47:27.574
PRESENTING IN THIS COMMITTEE --

01:47:27.641 --> 01:47:28.909
TO HOPEFULLY MOVE FORWARD --

01:47:28.975 --> 01:47:30.744
ADDITIONAL TAX RELIEF FOR

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:32.579
PRODUCTION THAT AREA I THINK

01:47:32.646 --> 01:47:33.246
IT'S SOMETHING WE ABSOLUTE HAVE

01:47:33.313 --> 01:47:35.382
TO TACKLE I AND THE FACT OF

01:47:35.448 --> 01:47:36.449
MATTER IS THE CRISIS IS

01:47:36.516 --> 01:47:37.784
