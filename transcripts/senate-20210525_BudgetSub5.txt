FEES PER MILE IN -- CALIFORNIA PLEASE MORE ADMIN FEES PER MILE THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION AND I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY OURS ARE SO HIGH -- THAT WAS A COMMENTS AND THEN -- SO AGAIN IF YOU GO TO ITEM TWENTY IN SECTION B. STEAM BECAUSE IT LOOKS AGAIN LIKE IT WOULD BE SUPPORTABLE LANGUAGE THAT WITHOUT SEEING THE LANGUAGE IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE TO EVEN MAKE A DECISION BUT WHEN YOU READ THE CHEST OF WHAT THE INTENT IS IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE SUPPORTABLE BUT LIKE I SAID WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY LANGUAGE AND IT'S REALLY HARD FOR US TO VOTE ON BILLS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE LANGUAGE FOR I'M TRYING TO GET TO THE U. I. P.'S SO I APOLOGIZE NO NO APOLOGIES SENATOR MANY JUST SKIP OVER THE DMV I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THAT'S A DISASTER IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT WE'VE SPENT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR REAL ID'S ACTUALLY WHEN A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THERE IS A DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATION A HOT WHITE HOUSE I. HELP CALIFORNIA GET THEIR FIRST EXTENSION FOR REAL ID HE'S IN NOW -- WE'VE INVESTED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND ANOTHER THREE OR FORTY TWO MILLION WHICH IS APPROVED FROM THIS AGENDA FOR FUTURE YEARS I JUST THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL GO THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS OF THEIR FIVE YEAR FOR YOUR ID -- OR DRIVER'S LICENSE ISSUED -- BEFORE THEY HAVE TO DO ANY ADDITIONAL STUFF FOR REAL ID'S SO IT DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME AND I GUESS I I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M LOOKING AT IT FROM A BUSINESS STANDPOINT IF MY CONTRACT WAS GOING TO RENEW IN THREE YEARS I WOULDN'T NEED A FIVE YEAR EXTENSION IN ORDER TO APPROVE THE CONTRACT RIGHT IT'S JUST GONNA BE RENEWED ON A NATIONAL BASIS SO I HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE AND AND THEN THAT CAN BE A CONSIDERATION BECAUSE THAT SAVES TAXPAYERS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THE U. I FIND I. E. R. E.
