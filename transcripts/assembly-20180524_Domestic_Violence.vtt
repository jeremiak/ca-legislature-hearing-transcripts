LIFETIME. AND A SURVEY WE

00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:14.740 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:16.675 region:rollup2
SHOWED THAT FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.377 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN EITHER

00:31:16.675 --> 00:31:20.612 region:rollup2
TOUCH TO BUY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:22.647 region:rollup2
EITHER AS A VICTIM. AS AN ABUSER

00:31:20.612 --> 00:31:24.549 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES OR THROUGH A CLOSE

FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER.

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:28.787 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A COMPLEX

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:31.022 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AS YOU FRAMED EARLIER IT

00:31:28.787 --> 00:31:33.225 region:rollup2
CAUGHT ITS ITS CAUSES OCCUR OVER

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:34.626 region:rollup2
THE SPAN OF YEARS OR DECADES.

00:31:33.225 --> 00:31:37.162 region:rollup2
AND IT'S IT AND IT'S IMPACTS

00:31:34.626 --> 00:31:38.497 region:rollup2
AFFECT MORE THAN TWO INDIVIDUALS

00:31:37.162 --> 00:31:39.498 region:rollup2
IT EVERBERATES THROUGHOUT THE

00:31:38.497 --> 00:31:41.333 region:rollup2
LIVES IN NOT JUST OF THE

00:31:39.498 --> 00:31:43.034 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL SURVIVOR OR THE

00:31:41.333 --> 00:31:45.237 region:rollup2
ABUSER BUT ALSO THEIR CHILDREN

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:46.538 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES.

00:31:45.237 --> 00:31:48.573 region:rollup2
CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS FOR

00:31:46.538 --> 00:31:50.175 region:rollup2
SURVIVORS ARE WELL DOCUMENTED

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:51.576 region:rollup2
AND THE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO

00:31:50.175 --> 00:31:53.078 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WHO WITNESS PARENTAL

00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:54.346 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE ARE AMONG THE RISK

00:31:53.078 --> 00:31:56.014 region:rollup2
FACTORS THAT ARE FOUNDATION IS

00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:57.249 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:31:56.014 --> 00:31:59.017 region:rollup2
AS YOU WILL SEE AND ONE OF THE

00:31:57.249 --> 00:32:00.886 region:rollup2
HANDOUTS THAT YOU HAVE THE COST

00:31:59.017 --> 00:32:02.621 region:rollup2
TO THE HEALTH SYSTEM ESTIMATE IS

00:32:00.886 --> 00:32:03.789 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED TO HE IN THE BILLIONS.

00:32:02.621 --> 00:32:05.223 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW THAT THIS DATA IS

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:07.259 region:rollup2
INCOMPLETE

00:32:05.223 --> 00:32:09.661 region:rollup2
WE KNOW BECAUSE MANY VICTIMS DO

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:11.029 region:rollup2
NOT REPORT THEIR ABUSE.

00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:12.764 region:rollup2
IT IS CLEAR THAT IN ADDITION TO

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:14.099 region:rollup2
MEETING THE MOST IMMEDIATE AND

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:16.468 region:rollup2
PRESSING NEEDS OF VULNERABLE

00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:18.069 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS WE ALSO NEED TO CREATE

00:32:16.468 --> 00:32:20.038 region:rollup2
NEW KINDS OF SOLUTIONS AND

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:20.739 region:rollup2
PREVENTION APPROACHES.

00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:22.374 region:rollup2
OVER THE PAST YEAR THE

00:32:20.739 --> 00:32:23.508 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION HAS BEEN EXPLORING

00:32:22.374 --> 00:32:25.043 region:rollup2
HOW WE CANINVEST MORE

00:32:23.508 --> 00:32:27.045 region:rollup2
STRATEGICALLY IN PREVENTING

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:29.014 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:30.782 region:rollup2
WE HAVE LEARNED THAT A DOMESTIC

00:32:29.014 --> 00:32:32.517 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE HAS ITS OWN ROOT CAUSES

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:34.019 region:rollup2
AND COMMUNITY DETERMINANTS

00:32:32.517 --> 00:32:35.387 region:rollup2
THE PIPELINE FOR DOMESTIC

00:32:34.019 --> 00:32:37.789 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE PERPETRATION AND

00:32:35.387 --> 00:32:40.025 region:rollup2
VICTIMIZATION OFTEN STARTS WITH

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:41.793 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD EXPOSURE TO ABUSE AND

00:32:40.025 --> 00:32:43.728 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO EARLY ADULTHOOD.

00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:45.163 region:rollup2
WHILE THERE IS LESS ROBUST DATA

00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:46.798 region:rollup2
ON HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PREVENTION

00:32:45.163 --> 00:32:48.466 region:rollup2
PRACTICES AND PROGRAMS THERE'S

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:50.101 region:rollup2
ALSO A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:51.636 region:rollup2
INVEST IN EXPERIMENTATION

00:32:50.101 --> 00:32:53.505 region:rollup2
LEARNING AND SCALING PROMISING

00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:54.606 region:rollup2
PREVENTION APPROACHES.

00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:56.041 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT WHEN

00:32:54.606 --> 00:32:57.542 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO IMPROVING THE LIVES

00:32:56.041 --> 00:32:58.677 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIANS THERE IS NO SUCH

00:32:57.542 --> 00:33:00.512 region:rollup2
THING AS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

00:32:58.677 --> 00:33:02.180 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

00:33:00.512 --> 00:33:03.148 region:rollup2
OUR STATE IS MADE UP OF MILLIONS

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.649 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE AND THOUSANDS OF

00:33:03.148 --> 00:33:05.984 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:08.019 region:rollup2
EACH WITH ITS UNIQUE SET OF

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:10.121 region:rollup2
ASSETS AND STRUGGLING WITH A

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:12.324 region:rollup2
UNIQUE SET OF CHALLENGES.

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:14.092 region:rollup2
AS THE FOUNDATION LOOKS FORWARD.

00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:15.427 region:rollup2
WE LOOK TO PROMOTE UP BOTH

00:33:14.092 --> 00:33:16.995 region:rollup2
HEALING AND PREVENTION OF

00:33:15.427 --> 00:33:18.930 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE AT MULTIPLE POINTS

00:33:16.995 --> 00:33:20.232 region:rollup2
ALONG THE INDIVIDUAL'S LIFESPAN.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.867 region:rollup2
WE WILL DO THIS BY REDUCING

00:33:20.232 --> 00:33:23.668 region:rollup2
EXPOSURE AND SUPPORTING YOU PREP

00:33:21.867 --> 00:33:25.637 region:rollup2
PREVENTION PRACTICES FOR HELP UP

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:48.379 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC.

FUNDING INNOVATIONS BUT ONE OF

00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:05.129 region:rollup2
THE EXCITING THINGS ABOUT THE

00:41:03.428 --> 00:41:07.298 region:rollup2
FOLKS IN THIS ROOM IS THAT THEY

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:09.367 region:rollup2
CAN SPEAK MORE TO THE KINDS OF

00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:11.669 region:rollup2
FAMILY BASED APPROACHES THAT ARE

00:41:09.367 --> 00:41:12.670 region:rollup2

.

00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:29.187 region:rollup2
WE ARE LOOKING AT THE EXPOSURE

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:30.321 region:rollup2
TO VIOLENCE AS A RISK FACTOR FOR

00:41:29.187 --> 00:41:32.090 region:rollup2
NACHOS VICTIMIZATION BUT

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:34.525 region:rollup2
PERPETRATION.

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:36.127 region:rollup2

I COME FROM A FAMILY WITH THREE

00:43:33.978 --> 00:43:37.348 region:rollup2
GENERATIONS OF DOMESTIC

00:43:34.479 --> 00:43:39.016 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE.

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:40.651 region:rollup2
MY MOM SHARES THE STORY OF BEING

00:43:39.016 --> 00:43:42.120 region:rollup2
A TEENAGER AND COMING HOME FROM

00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:44.522 region:rollup2
SCHOOL ONE DAY.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.956 region:rollup2
AND SEEING HER MY GRANDFATHER

00:43:44.522 --> 00:43:48.059 region:rollup2
YET AGAIN HITTING MY

00:43:44.956 --> 00:43:50.027 region:rollup2
GRANDMOTHER.

00:43:48.059 --> 00:43:52.697 region:rollup2
SO MY MOM WENT UP TO HER ROOM.

00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:54.098 region:rollup2
AND SHE SLIT HER WRISTS.

00:43:52.697 --> 00:43:55.867 region:rollup2
AND SHE WROTE A MESSAGE TO HER

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:58.102 region:rollup2
FATHER IN HER OWN BLOOD.

00:43:55.867 --> 00:43:59.270 region:rollup2
AND IT SAID IF I EVER HAVE TO

00:43:58.102 --> 00:44:03.708 region:rollup2
SEE YOU HIT MY MOM AGAIN. I WILL

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:05.409 region:rollup2
KILL MYSELF.

00:44:03.708 --> 00:44:07.578 region:rollup2
I THINK HOW DESPERATE.

00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:08.412 region:rollup2
MY MOTHER MUST HAVE FELT.

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:10.214 region:rollup2
THAT THE ONLY WAY SHE COULD

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:12.783 region:rollup2
PROTECT.

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:14.085 region:rollup2
MY GRANDMOTHER FROM ABUSE.

00:44:12.783 --> 00:44:16.854 region:rollup2
AND PROTECT HERSELF FROM HAVING

00:44:14.085 --> 00:44:19.490 region:rollup2
TO WITNESS IT.

00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:22.527 region:rollup2
WAS OFFER HOME LIFE.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:24.595 region:rollup2
SHE WAS A NORTH KOREAN REFUGEE.

00:44:22.527 --> 00:44:26.063 region:rollup2
GROWING UP IN SOUTH KOREA.

00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:27.832 region:rollup2
THAT HAD JUST BEEN UP RAVAGED BY

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:29.200 region:rollup2
CIVIL WAR.

00:44:27.832 --> 00:44:32.737 region:rollup2
THERE WERE NO RESOURCES FOR

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:34.472 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AT THAT TIME.

00:44:32.737 --> 00:44:35.640 region:rollup2
AND I THINK ABOUT HOW HOPELESS

00:44:34.472 --> 00:44:37.775 region:rollup2
MY GRANDMOTHER MUST'VE FELT IN

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.977 region:rollup2
HER SITUATION.

00:44:37.775 --> 00:44:41.112 region:rollup2
AS A REFUGEE HER ENTIRE FAMILY

00:44:39.977 --> 00:44:43.681 region:rollup2
WAS UP NORTH NEVER TO BE HEARD

00:44:41.112 --> 00:44:45.950 region:rollup2
OF FROM AGAIN.

00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:47.351 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THEY HAD BEEN NEARBY.

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:48.953 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE SUPPORTED

00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:50.955 region:rollup2
HER LEAVING HER HUSBAND

RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS OF DOMESTIC

00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:41.298 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE.

00:51:40.197 --> 00:51:43.100 region:rollup2
THEY WERE REFERRING MORE VICTIMS

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:44.635 region:rollup2
TO LESS.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.169 region:rollup2
AND THEY STARTED PREACHING FROM

00:51:44.635 --> 00:51:47.871 region:rollup2
THE PULPIT ABOUT DOMESTIC

00:51:45.169 --> 00:51:48.706 region:rollup2

ONCE THEY GOT TRAINED THEY

00:52:01.585 --> 00:52:04.722 region:rollup2

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:08.325 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MUST STOP FOR

00:52:04.722 --> 00:52:10.294 region:rollup2

DEVELOPED WITHIN MARGINALIZED

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:50.167 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:52:48.632 --> 00:52:52.169 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS NOW A MAJORITY

00:52:50.167 --> 00:52:54.171 region:rollup2
MINORITY STATE.

00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:55.839 region:rollup2
LATINOS ARE THE LARGEST RACIAL

GROUP IN THE STATE AN ASIAN

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:59.343 region:rollup2
PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE THE

FASTEST GROWING.

00:52:59.343 --> 00:53:02.446 region:rollup2
BOTH COMMUNITIES HAVE A LARGE

00:53:00.978 --> 00:53:04.715 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY.

00:53:02.446 --> 00:53:07.785 region:rollup2
THAT IS SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL

00:53:04.715 --> 00:53:09.620 region:rollup2

THAT GREATLY INTERESTS ME ARM.

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:36.580 region:rollup2
IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES WE

00:53:35.212 --> 00:53:38.348 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE A SYSTEMATIC

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:41.151 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO CHILD ABUSE

00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:42.086 region:rollup2
PREVENTION HEARING CALIFORNIA.

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:43.787 region:rollup2
AND PRETTY GROUNDBREAKING

00:53:42.086 --> 00:53:45.656 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION WHICH THE SIGNED IN

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:47.791 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO I THINK AB

00:53:45.656 --> 00:53:50.094 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN THIRTY THREE.

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:50.861 region:rollup2
COMMITTED TEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:53:50.094 --> 00:53:52.262 region:rollup2
THAT BILL OR THEY MEDIA

00:53:50.861 --> 00:53:52.763 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING BILL TEN MILLION

00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:54.198 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR CHILD ABUSE

00:53:52.763 --> 00:53:55.799 region:rollup2
PREVENTION.

00:53:54.198 --> 00:53:56.934 region:rollup2
AND THE APPROACH WAS ONE THAT

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:58.368 region:rollup2
KIND OF RINGS A BELL FOR ME AS

00:53:56.934 --> 00:54:00.037 region:rollup2
YOU TALK ABOUT.

00:53:58.368 --> 00:54:01.472 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT A STANDARD APPROACH IN

00:54:00.037 --> 00:54:03.273 region:rollup2
CERTAIN ENTITIES CAN IT THERE'S

00:54:01.472 --> 00:54:04.908 region:rollup2
NOT MUCH BRANCHING OUT.

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:06.410 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE APPROACH WHEN

00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:07.344 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA STARTED

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:08.745 region:rollup2
SYSTEMATICALLY MOVING AS CHILD

00:54:07.344 --> 00:54:10.714 region:rollup2
ABUSE PREVENTION.

00:54:08.745 --> 00:54:11.982 region:rollup2
AND THESE PROVISIONS NOW IS TWO

00:54:10.714 --> 00:54:13.183 region:rollup2
FLIES AND OFFER INSTITUTIONS

00:54:11.982 --> 00:54:14.284 region:rollup2
CODE.

00:54:13.183 --> 00:54:16.220 region:rollup2
WAS TO LET IN EVERY COUNTY THE

00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:17.921 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:19.890 region:rollup2
ORGANIZED GROUPS TO KIND OF PUT

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:22.693 region:rollup2
TOGETHER A PLAN FOR HOW THEY HAD

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:23.193 region:rollup2
A VISION OF SOME WAY TO RECTIFY.

00:54:22.693 --> 00:54:24.661 region:rollup2
AN ASPECT OF CHILD ABUSE

00:54:23.193 --> 00:54:26.396 region:rollup2
PREVENTION.

00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:27.531 region:rollup2
AND LET IDEAS KIND OF BUBBLE UP

00:54:26.396 --> 00:54:28.932 region:rollup2
FROM THE BOTTOM AND THEN COMPETE

00:54:27.531 --> 00:54:30.968 region:rollup2
FOR FUNDING.

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:32.636 region:rollup2
AND IT.

00:54:30.968 --> 00:54:34.905 region:rollup2
ALLOWED FOR ACTUALLY INNOVATION

00:54:32.636 --> 00:54:36.306 region:rollup2
IN THESE PROGRAMS.

00:54:34.905 --> 00:54:37.875 region:rollup2
THERE WERE TIED TO THE DISTINCT

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:39.276 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVES OF COMMITTEES FROM

00:54:37.875 --> 00:54:42.379 region:rollup2
EARTH WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:43.680 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:45.682 region:rollup2
I JUST FEEL THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.951 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTIVE.

00:54:45.682 --> 00:54:49.787 region:rollup2
WAY TO GO ABOUT DOING IT.

00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:51.455 region:rollup2
I THINK IN THIS AREA. I

00:54:49.787 --> 00:54:53.657 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY

00:54:51.455 --> 00:54:55.826 region:rollup2
FOCUSING UPON YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

00:54:53.657 --> 00:54:56.426 region:rollup2
BEAUSE I DO THINK A KEY PART OF

00:54:55.826 --> 00:54:57.594 region:rollup2
THE CHEMISTRY HERE IS SORT OF

00:54:56.426 --> 00:55:00.097 region:rollup2
THE.

00:54:57.594 --> 00:55:01.532 region:rollup2
A CULTURAL ENVELOPE PEOPLE RAN.

00:55:00.097 --> 00:55:02.733 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IS WHAT IS THE CUSTOM

00:55:01.532 --> 00:55:04.234 region:rollup2
WAY THAT THEY RESPOND TO THINGS

00:55:02.733 --> 00:55:06.703 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IS.

00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:08.772 region:rollup2
WHAT HISTORICISM WHAT IS JUST?

00:55:06.703 --> 00:55:10.207 region:rollup2
TO BE IN DIRT WHATEVER HE HAS.

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:11.608 region:rollup2
I THINK FINDING WAYS TO HELP

00:55:10.207 --> 00:55:13.377 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:14.244 region:rollup2
BE EMPOWERED

00:55:13.377 --> 00:55:16.547 region:rollup2
AND GET OVER SORT OF WHAT THEY

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:18.615 region:rollup2
THINK IS.

00:55:16.547 --> 00:55:20.117 region:rollup2
IS THE ONLY AVAILABLE PATH.

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:21.318 region:rollup2
A PATH THEY'RE FAMILIAR WITH

00:55:20.117 --> 00:55:23.554 region:rollup2
ARAGO THEY'RE MOST COMFORTABLE

00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:25.589 region:rollup2
WITH SO DESPITE.

00:55:23.554 --> 00:55:26.356 region:rollup2
WHAT'S BAD THEY DON'T QUITE KNOW

00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:28.859 region:rollup2
HOW TO FIND A NEW PATH.

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:30.060 region:rollup2
.

00:55:28.859 --> 00:55:32.062 region:rollup2
I KNOW ABOUT THE BILL BECAUSE I

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:33.430 region:rollup2
WORKED ON IT.

00:55:32.062 --> 00:55:34.998 region:rollup2
AND I. HAVE A PRESS RELEASE

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:37.034 region:rollup2
SAYING IN MY WALL FROM WHEN IT

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:38.001 region:rollup2
WAS SIGNED INTO LAW.

00:55:37.034 --> 00:55:39.570 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON WE DID THAT WE

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:42.072 region:rollup2
SIGNED INTO LAW WAS ACTUALLY

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:44.675 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO WAS

00:55:42.072 --> 00:55:45.209 region:rollup2
A YEAR OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

00:55:44.675 --> 00:55:47.044 region:rollup2
AND THE GOVERNOR WAS JERRY

00:55:45.209 --> 00:55:49.046 region:rollup2
BROWN.

00:55:47.044 --> 00:55:50.147 region:rollup2
AND HE SIGNED THE FUNDING.

00:55:49.046 --> 00:55:52.382 region:rollup2
DESPITE THE PROSPECT OF A

00:55:50.147 --> 00:55:54.818 region:rollup2
DOWNTURN.

00:55:52.382 --> 00:55:57.020 region:rollup2
TO PUT RESOURCES WHERE THEY

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:58.388 region:rollup2
WOULD BE VERY MUCH NEEDED.

00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:00.557 region:rollup2
SIGHS I CAN ASSURE THAT BECAUSE

00:55:58.388 --> 00:56:02.426 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS IS WHERE THIS TYPE

00:56:00.557 --> 00:56:04.194 region:rollup2
OF CONVERSATION SHOULD GO.

00:56:02.426 --> 00:56:05.329 region:rollup2
HOW CAN WE?

00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:06.563 region:rollup2
FIND THE RIGHT LEVEL OF

00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:07.097 region:rollup2
RESOURCES PROVIDING THE STATE

00:56:06.563 --> 00:56:08.799 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:11.702 region:rollup2
BUT

00:56:08.799 --> 00:56:13.337 region:rollup2

INCLUDES THE FIVE COUNTIES.

00:57:17.534 --> 00:57:19.436 region:rollup2
OKAY RIGHT. ONE OF THE I THINK

00:57:18.869 --> 00:57:20.737 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND I

00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:21.972 region:rollup2
GUESS WE'LL WE'LL FIGURE THAT

00:57:20.737 --> 00:57:24.441 region:rollup2
OUT IS THAT.

00:57:21.972 --> 00:57:25.242 region:rollup2
THEIR* OUT.

00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:26.910 region:rollup2
NOW THAT THEY'RE ALL EFFECTIVE

00:57:25.242 --> 00:57:29.079 region:rollup2
THERE SO MANY DIFFERENT DOMESTIC

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:31.081 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE PROGRAMS FUNDED BY SO

00:57:29.079 --> 00:57:32.649 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT SOURCES. AND EVEN

00:57:31.081 --> 00:57:34.217 region:rollup2
SOME OF.

00:57:32.649 --> 00:57:36.320 region:rollup2
IN THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY

00:57:34.217 --> 00:57:38.989 region:rollup2
SERVICES HERE AND SOME DIFFERENT

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:40.957 region:rollup2
PLACES SO IT'S LIKE.

00:57:38.989 --> 00:57:42.492 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S SO BROAD IN TERMS OF

00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:43.961 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAMS IN THE FUNDING IT'S

00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:45.262 region:rollup2
HARD TO WRAP YOUR HAND AROUND

00:57:43.961 --> 00:57:46.596 region:rollup2
WHAT THE STATE NEEDS TO DO

00:57:45.262 --> 00:57:48.098 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF SO MANY PIECES THAT

00:57:46.596 --> 00:57:49.566 region:rollup2
ARE MOVING.

00:57:48.098 --> 00:57:51.201 region:rollup2
AND.

00:57:49.566 --> 00:57:53.070 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT OUR. OFFICE OF

00:57:51.201 --> 00:57:55.706 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY SERVICES HAS SEVERAL

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:58.041 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PIECES AS WELL SO IT

00:57:55.706 --> 00:57:59.142 region:rollup2
BECOMES IT BECOMES A DIFFICULT

00:57:58.041 --> 00:58:00.977 region:rollup2
ISSUE NOT THAT WE SHOULDN'T

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:03.013 region:rollup2
GRAPPLE WITH THE BUT OFTENTIMES

00:58:00.977 --> 00:58:06.083 region:rollup2
IT COMES. RATHER QUICKLY AND.

00:58:03.013 --> 00:58:08.251 region:rollup2
AND THE ABILITY TO BASICALLY

00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:10.020 region:rollup2
COORDINATE IN SOME WAY BUILD

00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:11.555 region:rollup2
LEVEL FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:13.357 region:rollup2
YOU'VE COVERED EVERY AREA. YOU

00:58:11.555 --> 00:58:15.392 region:rollup2
KNOW EVERY CITY HAS A DIFFERENT

00:58:13.357 --> 00:58:17.227 region:rollup2
KIND OF PROGRAM AND. KNOW SAN

00:58:15.392 --> 00:58:18.261 region:rollup2
DIEGO HAS SEVERAL ITSELF

00:58:17.227 --> 00:58:20.397 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T IN TERMS OF SHELTERS

00:58:18.261 --> 00:58:20.697 region:rollup2
AND I'VE BEEN ON SEVERAL BOARDS

00:58:20.397 --> 00:58:22.099 region:rollup2
SO IT IT'S.

00:58:20.697 --> 00:58:23.166 region:rollup2
.

00:58:22.099 --> 00:58:24.935 region:rollup2
AT THIS LEVEL IT'S KIND OF HARD

00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:26.737 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU DOING YOU

00:58:24.935 --> 00:58:28.105 region:rollup2
KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE TEN

00:58:26.737 --> 00:58:29.373 region:rollup2
MILLION TWENTY MILLION FIFTY

00:58:28.105 --> 00:58:30.607 region:rollup2
MILLION WHATEVER IT IS. IT'S

00:58:29.373 --> 00:58:32.142 region:rollup2
HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IT

00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:33.510 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO GO.

00:58:32.142 --> 00:58:34.978 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER NOT WHERE IT'S

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:36.880 region:rollup2
GOING IS GOING TO BE THE MOST

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:38.682 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE WAY BECAUSE OFTENTIMES

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:40.017 region:rollup2
SQUEAKY WHEEL GETS THE OIL. BUT

00:58:38.682 --> 00:58:41.718 region:rollup2
IT MAY NOT BE THE MOST NECESSARY

00:58:40.017 --> 00:58:43.720 region:rollup2
PLACE AND SO I THINK AT SOME

00:58:41.718 --> 00:58:45.288 region:rollup2
POINT AND MAYBE THIS COMMITTEE

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.489 region:rollup2
WILL DEAL WITH THAT.

00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:47.824 region:rollup2
THE.

00:58:45.489 --> 00:58:49.826 region:rollup2
THE VARYING NEEDS AND HOW IT'S

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:51.261 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY COORDINATED NAM AND

00:58:49.826 --> 00:58:52.362 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT NO WE'VE ASKED THE

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:53.697 region:rollup2
OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:54.765 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT.

00:58:53.697 --> 00:58:56.333 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS A LOT OF STUFF

00:58:54.765 --> 00:58:58.402 region:rollup2
BEING PUT IN THAT.

00:58:56.333 --> 00:58:59.803 region:rollup2
OUR OFFICE THAT RELATES TO THIS

00:58:58.402 --> 00:59:01.638 region:rollup2
AREA AND SO UP.

00:58:59.803 --> 00:59:02.873 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS

00:59:01.638 --> 00:59:04.775 region:rollup2
WHICH I YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE

00:59:02.873 --> 00:59:06.009 region:rollup2
ARE LOT OF OTHER. ETHNIC GROUPS

00:59:04.775 --> 00:59:07.411 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO GRAPPLING WITH THE

00:59:06.009 --> 00:59:08.845 region:rollup2
THING BECAUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:59:07.411 --> 00:59:10.080 region:rollup2
IS A UP.

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:12.182 region:rollup2
IS A VERY.

00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.884 region:rollup2
OF BE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A

00:59:12.182 --> 00:59:14.985 region:rollup2
SITUATION THAT IS IS NOT ONLY

00:59:13.884 --> 00:59:16.153 region:rollup2
IMPACTED BY ALL THE OTHER THINGS

00:59:14.985 --> 00:59:18.355 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S ALSO GREATLY IMPACTED

00:59:16.153 --> 00:59:19.990 region:rollup2
BY CULTURE.

00:59:18.355 --> 00:59:21.525 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WOULD GROUPS DO AND

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:21.892 region:rollup2
DON'T DO YOU KNOW AND SO WHEN

00:59:21.525 --> 00:59:23.126 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT IT.

00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:25.128 region:rollup2
.

00:59:23.126 --> 00:59:26.029 region:rollup2
I KNOW AGES AGO WHEN I WAS ON

00:59:25.128 --> 00:59:27.264 region:rollup2
THE BOARD WHEN THEY START

00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:28.899 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN SAN DIEGO'S

00:59:27.264 --> 00:59:31.234 region:rollup2
ON THE REGIONAL BOARD AT THE WHY

00:59:28.899 --> 00:59:33.203 region:rollup2
AND FOR. AND IT WAS INTERESTING

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:34.805 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN THOUGH THE THE

00:59:33.203 --> 00:59:35.872 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN.

00:59:34.805 --> 00:59:36.973 region:rollup2
THERE WERE NO AFRICAN AMERICANS

00:59:35.872 --> 00:59:39.342 region:rollup2
IN THE PROGRAM.

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:40.343 region:rollup2
NONE WELL WHERE IN THE CENTERS

00:59:39.342 --> 00:59:42.179 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAVE YOU SO THE

00:59:40.343 --> 00:59:43.513 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THERE WASN'T

00:59:42.179 --> 00:59:45.082 region:rollup2
THAT MUCH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:47.451 region:rollup2
BLACK COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE BLACK

00:59:45.082 --> 00:59:48.985 region:rollup2
WOMEN GOT IT UNDER CONTROL AND

00:59:47.451 --> 00:59:50.787 region:rollup2
NOBODY HITS THEM LIKE I GOT HIT

00:59:48.985 --> 00:59:52.756 region:rollup2
BACK. A MINUTE WAS JILL THINKING

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:53.790 region:rollup2
SO IT DOES RESULT YOU KNOW HOPE

00:59:52.756 --> 00:59:56.193 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WASN'T A LOT OF

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:57.727 region:rollup2
SERVICES THERE BUT THERE WAS

00:59:56.193 --> 00:59:58.528 region:rollup2
ALSO A CONCERN THAT.

00:59:57.727 --> 01:00:00.864 region:rollup2
A WHEN YOU CALL THE POLICE IN

00:59:58.528 --> 01:00:02.099 region:rollup2
THE BLACK COMMUNITY YOU YOU GET

01:00:00.864 --> 01:00:04.601 region:rollup2
WORSE SITUATIONS REVENUE BETTER

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:05.535 region:rollup2
SITUATION SO IS A YOU MAY CALL

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.837 region:rollup2
OF THE MEN GET SHOT FOR DOING

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:08.738 region:rollup2
LITTLE OR NOTHING SO. AS A

01:00:06.837 --> 01:00:10.207 region:rollup2
RESULT COMMUNITIES WERE NOT

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:11.975 region:rollup2
WILLING TO ALWAYS OPEN UP AND

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:13.710 region:rollup2
CALL POLICE OFFICER BECAME

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:15.412 region:rollup2
REALLY DIFFICULT OUGHT TO DEAL

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.279 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE ISSUES IN A CULTURAL

01:00:15.412 --> 01:00:17.347 region:rollup2
WAY SO.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:18.482 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SO IT WOULD BE

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:20.383 region:rollup2
INTERESTING.

01:00:18.482 --> 01:00:21.985 region:rollup2
AS THOSE GROUPS DEVELOP YOU

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:23.720 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THEY ISSUE OF CULTURE

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:25.155 region:rollup2
BECAME EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.957 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE BECAUSE LOOK AT IN SO

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:28.325 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND AND SO

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:29.993 region:rollup2
MANY CULTURAL NORMS WHAT

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:31.428 region:rollup2
FAMILIES DO AND DON'T DO AND.

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:32.462 region:rollup2
AND HOW THE LARGER SOCIETY

01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:34.865 region:rollup2
INTERACTS WITH THEM HAS. A

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:36.733 region:rollup2
PROFOUND IMPACT ON ON WHAT'S

01:00:34.865 --> 01:00:37.901 region:rollup2
TAKING PLACE AND SO ON. A BUT I

TERMS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:45.542 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS BIG PICTURE LOOKS LIKE

01:00:44.074 --> 01:00:46.977 region:rollup2
AND HOPEFULLY ACTS OF THIS

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:49.446 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MIGHT BE ABLE TO.

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:50.814 region:rollup2
RAPIDS ARM AROUND AND GIVE SOME

01:00:49.446 --> 01:00:51.448 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:53.016 region:rollup2
I THINK A BIG CAPITAL AND SOME

01:00:51.448 --> 01:00:54.484 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE TO OUR. OF FUNDING

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:56.019 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND WHAT HAVE YOU IN

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:57.220 region:rollup2
TERMS OF SO WE HAVE SOME SITES

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:59.089 region:rollup2
SUMS SUMS.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:00.090 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY AND WHEN WE DEAL WITH

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:01.725 region:rollup2
IT THAT WE ARE REALLY

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:03.193 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSING THE

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:04.194 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT ARE OUT THERE AND

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:06.630 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE GOT ALL THE ISSUES

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:09.766 region:rollup2
COVERED. YEAH.

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:10.800 region:rollup2
YEAH MAY I RESPOND TO HIM.

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:12.035 region:rollup2
IT'S SO I CAN ONE OF THE THINGS

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.770 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:16.072 region:rollup2
BUDGET ASK FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.339 region:rollup2
AND SEXUAL ASSAULT IS THAT IT

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:19.075 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN.

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:20.844 region:rollup2
REQUESTED THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:22.746 region:rollup2
THAT FUNDING GO TO PREVENTION

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:25.148 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT UP TO MEET THIRTY

01:01:22.746 --> 01:01:27.417 region:rollup2
PERCENT FOR. A NEW STRATEGIES

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:29.786 region:rollup2
AND TEN PERCENT FOR EVALUATION.

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:31.588 region:rollup2
AND WITH IN THAT STRUCTURE

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:32.956 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO BEEN AN EMPHASIS

01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:34.624 region:rollup2
THAT NEW FUNDING NEEDS TO GO TO

01:01:32.956 --> 01:01:36.259 region:rollup2
CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE SERVICE

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:37.727 region:rollup2
SAYS SO. I THINK THERE ARE SOME

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:39.429 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK.

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:41.298 region:rollup2
BEING WORKED OUT WHERE SEE OUR

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:42.599 region:rollup2
DD AND FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:44.834 region:rollup2
CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE HAS TO GO

01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:45.669 region:rollup2
IN EACH OF THOSE AREAS

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:47.971 region:rollup2
PREVENTION IN.

01:01:45.669 --> 01:01:49.372 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION AND EVALUATION AND

01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:50.507 region:rollup2
TO GO BACK TO YOU ASSEMBLY

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.741 region:rollup2
MEMBER COOLIES POINT WHEN YOU

01:01:50.507 --> 01:01:53.510 region:rollup2
MENTION I THINK THE I THINK IT'S

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:54.978 region:rollup2
A VERY ASTUTE. OBSERVATION YOU

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:56.746 region:rollup2
MADE AND AND YOU'RE AND I THANK

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:58.248 region:rollup2
YOU FOR THE EXPLANATION. AND YOU

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:59.683 region:rollup2
MENTIONED HOW COMMUNITIES DID IT

01:01:58.248 --> 01:02:02.285 region:rollup2
FROM THE BOTTOM UP APPROACH AND

01:01:59.683 --> 01:02:02.886 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:03.687 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW WE

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:11.628 region:rollup2
HAVE A VERY.

01:02:03.687 --> 01:02:11.895 region:rollup2
SCHOOL RIDE SYSTEM THAT SAYS

01:02:11.628 --> 01:02:12.896 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:14.297 region:rollup2
ABOUT WE DON'T CALL IT BOTTOM UP

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:16.199 region:rollup2
WE CALL IT MARCHING TO CENTER

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:17.234 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S THE SAME IDEA LET'S

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:18.435 region:rollup2
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:20.904 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:22.672 region:rollup2
MARGINALIZED WHAT HAD THEY DONE

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:24.741 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE. AND LET'S

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:27.711 region:rollup2
BRING THAT AND BRING THAT INTO

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:29.012 region:rollup2
THE MIX OF SERVICES AND PROGRAMS

01:02:27.711 --> 01:02:30.513 region:rollup2
THAT WERE OFFERING IN THIS STATE

01:02:29.012 --> 01:02:32.649 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:34.918 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT MODEL IS.

01:02:32.649 --> 01:02:37.320 region:rollup2
MEN IT'S HE'S NOT MAN BATTERERS

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:39.256 region:rollup2
ARE TAKING AWAY INCARCERATED AND

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.124 region:rollup2
SURVIVORS ARE USUALLY GOING INTO

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:43.526 region:rollup2
SHELTER AND OUR SYSTEM IS VERY

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:44.728 region:rollup2
MUCH FOCUSED ON THE CRISIS WE

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:46.096 region:rollup2
HAVE HOT LIKE WE HAVE SHELTER

01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:47.264 region:rollup2
BUT. AND IT'S SHELTERS ARE

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:49.132 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WE'VE

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:51.201 region:rollup2
ALWAYS HAD NEED THEM AND THAT

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:53.236 region:rollup2
TWENTY A MILLION DOLLARS WAS FOR

01:02:51.201 --> 01:02:54.704 region:rollup2
THAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE MISSING IS

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:57.007 region:rollup2
WORSE THE PREVENTION RECEIPT

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:58.441 region:rollup2
EARLY INTERVENTION WHERE IS THE

01:02:57.007 --> 01:03:01.044 region:rollup2

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:02.779 region:rollup2
SOME COMMUNITY SAY I DON'T WANT.

01:03:01.044 --> 01:03:04.581 region:rollup2

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:06.316 region:rollup2
STILL DO TO ADDRESS DOMESTIC

01:03:04.581 --> 01:03:07.250 region:rollup2

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:08.652 region:rollup2
WHERE THE FAMILIES DON'T WANNA

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.452 region:rollup2
BE SEPARATED.

01:03:08.652 --> 01:03:11.588 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHAT I'VE SEEN IN OUR

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:13.823 region:rollup2

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:15.225 region:rollup2

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:45.889 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF

THE LEAD THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY

01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:47.857 region:rollup2
NOT A SILLY LOOKING.

01:03:46.356 --> 01:03:48.425 region:rollup2
AYE UNFORTUNATELY THE MAJORITY

ARE LATINO BUT I KNOW THAT

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:50.427 region:rollup2
THERE'S OTHER IMMIGRANT

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:51.661 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DEALING

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:54.798 region:rollup2
WITH THIS I'VE BEEN IN

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:55.699 region:rollup2

TOO INC TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL WE

01:13:23.266 --> 01:13:27.536 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO LISTEN TO THE DATA.

01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:29.705 region:rollup2
THE DATA IS AT THE CENTER OF OUR

THAT PROGRAM UNFORTUNATELY A LOT

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:36.257 region:rollup2

THE ONE I'M MORE.

01:37:03.418 --> 01:37:09.157 region:rollup2
THERE'S TWO PART OF IT THERE IS

01:37:05.953 --> 01:37:11.159 region:rollup2
TO WIND THAT WE ARE DOING THIS

01:37:09.157 --> 01:37:12.593 region:rollup2
RESEARCH STUDY TOOK FOR THAT

01:37:11.159 --> 01:37:14.362 region:rollup2

BUT ALSO WE HAVE AYE AYE

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:18.1000 region:rollup2
CONTRACT WITH A LOCAL BEEKEEPER

01:37:17.432 --> 01:37:21.436 region:rollup2

01:37:18.1000 --> 01:37:22.904 region:rollup2
DEPARTAMENTO HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

01:37:21.436 --> 01:37:25.039 region:rollup2

THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS GRAND

01:37:25.039 --> 01:37:29.043 region:rollup2
FOR ONE YEAR.

01:37:26.641 --> 01:37:30.511 region:rollup2
AND WE ONLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

01:37:29.043 --> 01:37:32.447 region:rollup2
HAVE ONE PERSON THE TEN HOURS

01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:34.515 region:rollup2
PER WEEK.

01:37:32.447 --> 01:37:36.517 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THAT ONLY CLASS IN

01:37:34.515 --> 01:37:37.051 region:rollup2
THAT CLASS IT'S WE STARTED THE

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:39.687 region:rollup2
CLASS WITHOUT A WOMEN ONLY

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:40.922 region:rollup2
CLASS.

01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:44.225 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE OF THE WOMEN'S

01:37:40.922 --> 01:37:46.227 region:rollup2
HISTORY HAVING THAT DEMANDS OF.

01:37:44.225 --> 01:37:47.995 region:rollup2
THEM BEING MORE INTERESTED TO

01:37:46.227 --> 01:37:49.731 region:rollup2
BRING THEIR PARTNERS WITH THEM.

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:50.498 region:rollup2
SO WE STARTED OPEN THAT.

01:37:49.731 --> 01:37:52.400 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO BE.

01:37:50.498 --> 01:37:54.535 region:rollup2
.

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:56.270 region:rollup2
WIFE AND HUSBAND.

01:37:54.535 --> 01:37:57.739 region:rollup2
I CLASSES TO GET FOR THAT ONLY.

01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:59.874 region:rollup2
.

01:37:57.739 --> 01:38:01.743 region:rollup2
CLASSES LEAVING WOULD LOVE.

01:37:59.874 --> 01:38:03.211 region:rollup2
I THINK SOMEONE MENTIONED IT

01:38:01.743 --> 01:38:03.678 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

01:38:03.211 --> 01:38:05.213 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF.

01:38:03.678 --> 01:38:06.881 region:rollup2
.

01:38:05.213 --> 01:38:08.149 region:rollup2
KIND OF CULTURAL BELIEFS

01:38:06.881 --> 01:38:09.817 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND FROM

01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:11.152 region:rollup2
THE NOT ONLY THE LATINO BY THE

01:38:09.817 --> 01:38:12.687 region:rollup2
INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES. AND

01:38:11.152 --> 01:38:13.755 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LOT OF OTHER FACTORS

01:38:12.687 --> 01:38:15.690 region:rollup2
THAT INFLUENCE ON THE DECISION

01:38:13.755 --> 01:38:17.091 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE BY CALLING THE POLICE

01:38:15.690 --> 01:38:19.494 region:rollup2
HAVE THERE'S A VIOLENCE.

01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:21.362 region:rollup2
SO DO THE LESS THAT OUR PEOPLE

01:38:19.494 --> 01:38:22.797 region:rollup2
WERE MAINLY WOMEN ARE VICTIMS

01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:24.165 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WANT TO DO IS TO CALL

01:38:22.797 --> 01:38:25.366 region:rollup2
THE POLICE BECAUSE HE THE CALL

01:38:24.165 --> 01:38:27.568 region:rollup2
THAT BELIEF IN THE PUT UP POLICE

01:38:25.366 --> 01:38:28.069 region:rollup2
ON THERE HAS BEEN. THEY KNOW

01:38:27.568 --> 01:38:28.903 region:rollup2
THAT THAT PERSON WILL BE

01:38:28.069 --> 01:38:29.704 region:rollup2
DEPORTED.

01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:31.372 region:rollup2
AND THAT WILL BE A FAMILY

01:38:29.704 --> 01:38:33.207 region:rollup2
SEPARATION.

01:38:31.372 --> 01:38:34.275 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS SOME WOMEN'S THAT

01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:35.510 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T WANT TO COME A PHONE

01:38:34.275 --> 01:38:37.311 region:rollup2
AND SAY I'M HAVING DOMESTIC

01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:38.946 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE THAT'S THAT INSTEAD OF

01:38:37.311 --> 01:38:41.249 region:rollup2
HAVING MORE LIKE WHAT IS.

01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:42.583 region:rollup2
WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES IS THERE

01:38:41.249 --> 01:38:44.185 region:rollup2
SO I CAN INCLUDE MY HOUSE WHEN

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:45.887 region:rollup2
IN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW

AND RAISED THERE AND I LEARNED

01:42:28.743 --> 01:42:33.180 region:rollup2
LATER AFTER SHE HAD COME TO

01:42:30.778 --> 01:42:34.815 region:rollup2
BERKELEY AS A SENIOR CITIZEN.

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:36.784 region:rollup2
THAT IN HER YOUNGER YEARS SHE

KNEW THAT THAT WAS THE HOUSE

01:42:42.289 --> 01:42:45.459 region:rollup2

WAS JUST AS STRONG AND BOLD.

01:42:56.537 --> 01:43:00.708 region:rollup2
THEN AS SHE WAS LATER IN HER

01:42:58.839 --> 01:43:02.176 region:rollup2
EIGHTIES AND NINETIES AND SHE

01:43:00.708 --> 01:43:03.778 region:rollup2

FRIENDS ARE BETTER.

01:43:14.588 --> 01:43:19.126 region:rollup2
AND THEY COULD STAY AT HER HOUSE

01:43:16.524 --> 01:43:20.327 region:rollup2
AND STAY WITH HER UNTIL.

01:43:19.126 --> 01:43:22.863 region:rollup2
USUALLY THEY FELT LIKE THEY

01:43:20.327 --> 01:43:24.932 region:rollup2

BUT.

01:53:29.736 --> 01:53:32.139 region:rollup2
THERE WAS AN ADVOCACY OF SHIFT.

01:53:31.405 --> 01:53:33.974 region:rollup2
OF THAT OUR MEN ARE NOT

01:53:32.139 --> 01:53:35.008 region:rollup2

01:53:33.974 --> 01:53:36.677 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE PART OF MY

AWAY.

01:53:50.290 --> 01:53:53.493 region:rollup2

BE HURTING ANYBODY ELSE.

01:54:15.749 --> 01:54:20.187 region:rollup2
