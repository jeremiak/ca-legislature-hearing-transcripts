FIVE ALL RIGHT I'LL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE ALSO NOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS ON DOING AUTHOR OF EIGHTY TWO ONE SEVEN NINE IS PRESENT QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE SERVICE CENTER WIENER ABOUT THAT OKAY IT WAS A LITTLE HARDER TO FIT BETTER -- THANK YOU NO QUESTIONS I THINK I UNDERSTAND THE BILL -- WELL BUT I DO WANNA EXPLAIN WHY WHY I'M GOING TO BE VOTING AGAINST THIS BILL TODAY AT FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS IS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT WITH THE AUTHORS THE JOINT AUTHORS WHO ARE -- TWO OF THE TWO HOUSING CHAMPIONS THE LEGISLATURE AND -- TO MY FAVORITE PEOPLE NOT THE SAME BUT TO TO BROWN THOSE OR ANYTHING I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INCREDIBLE WORK BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL IS NOT JUST ABOUT YOU KNOW TO AUTHORS TO BRAINSTORM SOME IS A BROADER -- EFFORTS IN THE LEGISLATURE -- AND THIS THIS BILL -- TODAY I'VE I'VE SUPPORTED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE PREVIOUS -- EVICTION PROTECTION -- BILLS -- EVEN THOUGH NOT EVERY EVERYONE WAS A LITTLE HAPPY AND I'M HAPPY WITH THOSE BILLS BUT ULTIMATELY THOSE BILLS PROTECTED A LOT OF PEOPLE -- AND THIS BILL WILL X. THERE'S GOOD IN IT -- THE YOU KNOW THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE QUEUE OF APPLIED IN AND BECAUSE OF THE THIS BUREAUCRATIC ISSUES A KNOCK ON PAID THEY WILL BE PROTECTED BY THIS BILL -- AND THAT MAKES IT VERY TEMPTING TO SUPPORT IT -- BUT THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE TO IT -- FOR ME -- WINDOWS EVEN THOUGH THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING A LOT BETTER IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH OUTCOMES ALTHOUGH I'M GIVEN VACCINATION RATES NOT BEING WHERE THEY ARE WHO THE HECK KNOWS WHERE WE'RE GONNA GO AND THANK YOU MS WORKS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON ON THAT ISSUE -- FALLOUT FROM LAST TWO YEARS IS NOT OVER AND THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED THIS SIGNIFICANTLY ECONOMIC ECONOMICALLY -- WHO ARE STILL HURTING THEY HAVE NOT RECOVERED ECONOMICALLY AND THESE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW INCOME WORKING CLASS FAMILIES PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST A BREADWINNER -- PEOPLE WHO EMPLOYED FOR A LARGER TIME AND NO LONGER HAVE EVEN IF EVEN IF THEY HAD A LITTLE NEST EGG MAY NO LONGER HAVE THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR BUSINESSES THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT RECOVERED A LARGE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS PROTECTIONS PROVIDES ABOUT STABILITY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LOSE YOUR HOME I'M NOT PERFECT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A LONG TERM SOLUTION BUT IT IS STABILITY TO RECOVER NOW -- AND THAT'S WHY I'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED THEM EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T AGREED WITH EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF EACH OF THOSE -- HE'S OF THOSE BILLS WHAT REALLY PRESENTS A CHALLENGE FOR ME WITH WITH THIS BILL IS IT IT DOES AND THE VICTIM PROTECTIONS FOR THE STATE OF EXTRA PROTECTIONS FOR A LARGE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS READY RETAINS THOSE PROTECTIONS ONLY FOR THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND I THINKER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THERE ARE FOR THE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO WERE IN THE QUEUE WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR RELIEF BUT HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT THEY WILL RECEIVE THREE MONTHS OF ADDITIONAL PROTECTION SO THEY CAN HAVE A HOPE OF GETTING THAT MONEY -- AND STAYING IN THEIR HOMES BUT FOR EVERYONE ELSE PROTECTIONS GO AWAY -- AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW I THINK A TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE APPLIED TO MODE TWO THIRDS OF THEM CAUGHT AND RELEASED THE THIRD ABOUT A THIRD OF THEM HAVE BEEN -- THAT'S A LOT OF OTHER CALIFORNIANS AND I'M CONFIDENT -- ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RENT RELIEF AND HAVE NOT APPLIED FOR WHATEVER REASON THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT OR ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE OR SINCE THEY HAVE NOT -- APPLIED THEY WILL LOSE THEIR EVICTION PROTECTIONS ON FRIDAY AND THEY WILL BE FOREVER BARRED FROM APPLYING FOR RENT RELIEF BECAUSE THE CURTAIN COMES DOWN MIDNIGHT ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND THEY CAN NO LONGER APPLY FOR RENT RELEASE -- AND THEY WILL NO LONGER HAVE PROTECTIONS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT APPLY AND IT'S NOT FIXABLE THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TO APPLY AND THEY CAN BE WE -- AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT ISSUE FOR ME WITH THE PREEMPTION WE'RE WE'RE GONNA AND THE STATE PROTECTIONS WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET YOU APPLY TO TRY TO STAY IN YOUR HOME OR TO TRIGGER PROTECTIONS AND IF YOUR CITY WANTS TO PROTECT YOU THEY CAN'T BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE TAKING AWAY THAT WAS ALWAYS THE DEAL ON THIS AS AN ASIDE WE WERE GONNA PUT STATE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE AND IN EXCHANGE THE CITY'S CANADA DR OWN PROTECTIONS RIGHT AND THAT WAS A WE CAN HAVE WHATEVER OPINION YOU WANT ABOUT PREEMPTION IT WAS A REASONABLE DEAL BUT THE STATE PROTECTIONS ARE GOING AWAY AND NO MORE LOCAL -- PROTECTIONS ARE ALLOWED AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT THREE MONTHS EXCEPT IF YOU'RE IN ONE OF THE FAVORED LUCKY CITIES CITY OF LA I THINK OAKLAND ALAMEDA URAL OUT FUSE IF YOU'RE LUCKY TO LIVE IN THOSE CITIES YOU GET TO KEEP YOUR LOCAL PROTECTIONS THEY GOT TO KICK AGAIN BUT NOT IN SAN FRANCISCO OR THAT IS A PART OF THAT FAVORITE LIST AND WHAT'S THE DISTINCTION OF WHO GETS TO BE ON THAT LIST OR NOT IF YOU ENACTED BEFORE AUGUST NINETEENTH TWENTY TWENTY THAT THEN YOU'RE ALLOWED TO KEEP YOUR LOCAL PROTECTIONS BECAUSE YOU -- ADOPTED BEFORE AUGUST NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY AND DIDN'T LET IT EXPIRE AND WE AUTHORIZES AFTER THAT IF YOU DIDN'T ADOPTED BY THEN -- FOR EXPIRES AND GOT GOT RE AUTHORIZED THEN YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SO SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT BY RESIDENTS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE CODED EVICTION PROTECTIONS ANYMORE VIEW OF THE CITY OF LA YOU CAN -- DIED IS -- THERE'S NO RATIONAL BASIS FOR THAT DISTINCTION ABOUT WHAT CITIES ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE A LOCAL PROTECTIONS AND WHAT ARE AND IT'S AN ARBITRARY DISTINCTION -- AND SO I'M SAYING ALL THESE THINGS NOT TO DUMP OVER THE BY NOW THIS BILL I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT IT'S GOING TO PASS AND AND LEASE TO TENANTS IN THE QUEUE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND I SUPPORT THAT THOUSAND PERCENT AND IT PAINS ME NOT TO BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR THE BILL BECAUSE I WANT TO HELP AND PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE BUT I NEED TO EXPLAIN TO THOSE PEOPLE IN THE QUEUE WHY I'M NOT VOTING FOR THIS BILL I NEED TO EXPLAIN TO MY OWN CONSTITUENTS ARE WHY I CAN'T SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION TODAY SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU JOINT AUTHORS FOR FOR DOING DOES AN EXCELLENT PART OF THIS BILL YOU'RE PROTECTING A LOT OF PEOPLE BY MOVING THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD AND I THANK YOU -- FOR THAT AS WELL AS OUR OTHER WORK ON HOUSING BUT I WANT TO EXPLAIN WHY WHY I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SAID EARLIER CENTER MORICHES JUST TO MAYBE FOR POINT OF CLARIFICATION -- WHEN THIS ISSUE FIRST CAME UP MANY MOONS BACK -- I SUPPORTED EXPECTING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DEGREE RESOLUTION -- AND THEN IT CAME BACK A DIFFERENT FORM AGAIN AND I WILL DISAPPOINTED THIS IS ALMOST IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD FOR CALIFORNIA TO REMEDY SOME OF THE BUREAUCRATIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE HICCUPS ALONG THE WAY -- THIS TO ME SEEMS RELATIVELY BENIGN ONLY BECAUSE IT'S FOR SUCH SHORT DURATION SO MAYBE YOU CAN HELP EXPLAIN WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THIS SHORT DURATION AND WHY IS A CONSEQUENTIAL IN IMPORTANT YEAH THANK YOU FOR THROUGHOUT EUROPE SURE DO THE TRICK WOULD EVER YOU LIKE TO RESPOND OKAY THANK YOU AND -- I AM GLAD TO BE HERE WITH JOINT AUTHORS SOME REMEMBER WICKS WHO MAY WANT TO ALSO RESPOND TO THAT I IT SPECIFICALLY IF I MAY TO BE ABLE TO BALANCE BOTH THE RENTER AND THE LANDLORD TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL PARTIES FOLKS GET TO STAY IN THEIR HOME OR THEIR LIVING SPACE AND ALSO THE ONE THAT IS THE LANDLORD THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY IS ALSO MADE WHOLE AT THE SAME TIME SPECIFIC TO SAN FRANCISCO AND THANK YOU TO MY -- TO MY SENATOR CALLING THAT HAS MADE SOME VERY VALID POINTS AND AND PASSIONATE ABOUT WANTING TO SUPPORT AND DO SO ON BOTH SIDES THE STATE'S ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WAS ALREADY SET TO CLOSE ON MARCH THE THIRTY FIRST WHICH MEANS THAT ALL THE VIXENS WERE GOING TO EXPIRE FOR PEOPLE OF THAT FICTION PROTECTIONS WE'RE GOING TO EXPIRE FOR PEOPLE WHO OWED BACK RENT FROM OCTOBER UNTIL NOW WITHOUT AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY NINE ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE AWAITING THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE IMMINENT COULD BE HE VISITED ON APRIL THE FIRST INCLUDING PEOPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE SAN FRANCISCO'S NEW ORDINANCE ONLY PROTECTS PEOPLE FOR NON PAYMENT OF RENT MOVING FORWARD NOT FOR BACK RENT A BOAT SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL FROM THE STATE HI AND IT HAPPENS ON JUNE FIFTEENTH -- AND ALL THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- I THINK THE CHALLENGES WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE APPLIED MONTHS AGO HAVEN'T RECEIVED THOSE FUNDS AND IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THERE THAT THOSE FUNDS WILL BE RECEIVED AT THAT POINT OKAY AND THAT IS WHAT IS CRITICAL AND IT'S YOU KNOW I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT IS NOT THE LANDLORD AND THE TENANT FAULT THAT THE STATE HASN'T FUNDED AND NOT ENOUGH TIME RIGHT AND SO WE'RE BUYING MORE TIME SO THAT THE PROGRAM CAN BE IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY SO IS THERE AN EXPECTATION THAT THE STATE WILL SATISFY ALL THESE OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS BY JUNE OFFICIALLY DONE THAT IS THE GOAL DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT IF IT'S NOT ACHIEVE THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE COMING BACK ASKING FOR ANOTHER EXTENSION WELL I I BELIEVE THE THE THE FACTOR HERE IS THAT IS THAT THE MONEY THAT WERE CUT THAT WAS COMING FROM THE FEDS THE FUNDING COMING FROM THE FEDS VERY SLOW IN ROLLING OUT TO THE STATE WHICH IS WHY THE STATE'S STALLED THE APPROVAL PROCESS NOW THAT THE FUNDING IS PRESENT AND WE'RE READY TO GO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD OF FULL WITH THE PROCESS AS FAR AS THE APPROVAL AND AND GETTING THE CHECKS OUT IN SO I'M WILLING I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY GRIEVANCES ON THE BALANCING ACT OF LOOKING AFTER TENANTS FOR AS WELL AS LANDLORDS BECAUSE BOTH WERE AFFECTED AND EACH HAD AN OBLIGATION TO TO ONE OR BOTH OR THIRD PARTIES -- THE FACT THAT THIS IS GOING TO EXPIRE IN JUNE I'M WILLING TO TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS TODAY BUT IF CALIFORNIA CAN'T GET -- IT'S ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES CORRECT I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT YOU'RE DONE AS WELL THAT WERE ALL DONE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE FOR ANOTHER EXTENSION CALIFORNIA'S WOULD CALIFORNIA'S OF INSTRUMENTS I PLAY BUT I'LL BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS TODAY THIS ISSUE ONCE AND FOR ALL THANK YOU SIR BORDERS ANYONE ELSE SITTING OF THE HOUSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I I TO WANT TO THINK THAT THE AUTHORS BECAUSE I KNOW -- THIS IS NOT AN EASY FEAT FOR ANY OF US AND IF WE'RE GOING TO I I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT -- IF WE'RE GONNA SUPPORT ANYONE YOU KNOW IT'S THE THESE FOLKS IN THE QUEUE OF COURSE BUT OF COURSE THERE IS A LARGE SEGMENT OF FOLKS THAT COULDN'T GET ENOUGH AFTER YEAR FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND TECHNICAL GLITCHES MANY OF OF WHOM OF FOLKS THAT DID NOT SPEAK ENGLISH SPANISH SPEAKERS CHINESE SPEAKERS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO GET IN THE QUEUE AND FOR ME REPRESENTING LOS ANGELES ABOUT A VERY SMALL PORTION OF CITY OF LA SO THERE ARE PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE FOLKS IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES FOR THREE MONTHS AND THEN YOU GO ACROSS THE STREET TO UNINCORPORATED SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES AND THEY ARE NOT PROTECTED NET THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST UNSERVED UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND ALL OF LOS ANGELES SO LIKE MY MY COLLEAGUE IN SAN FRANCISCO I I'M I'M PAINED BY THIS BECAUSE WE WE KNOW WE CAN DO MORE BUT I I JUST THINK YOU BECAUSE WE'RE DOING SOMETHING AND I'D RATHER DO SOMETHING THAN NOT TO DO ANYTHING -- AND I KNOW L. A. COUNTY HAS HAD A A REMEDY AND THEY'VE ACTUALLY HAD A REALLY DEEP YOU KNOW THOUGHTFUL PROCESS ON THIS IT'S JUST I WISH I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE THAT WE CAN DO AND I I ALTHOUGH I HAVE DEEP CONCERNS I WILL SUPPORT THIS BUT I ALSO WANT TO KNOW THAT -- AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO MESSAGE TO MY CONSTITUENTS WILL DO BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM TO THINK THAT THEY HAVE NOT AND SO WITH THAT I WILL SUPPORT TODAY BUT OF COURSE THEY WANT US TO CONTINUE TO THE DISCUSSIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS CONSISTENT TO ECHO THE THE COMMENTS OF MY MY COLLEAGUES -- AND THE RELUCTANCE THAT I I I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH MY CONSTITUENTS YET AND I THINK WITH THIS VOTE I DON'T KNOW THE WE OBLIGATE OURSELVES TO THIS BEING THE ASSISTANCE EFFORT I THINK THIS OBLIGATES US TO LOOK TO THE BUDGET TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR SOME ACTION AND I RECOGNIZE WHERE TO STOP GAP SITUATION AND THAT DEALS HAVE TO BE NEGOTIATED BUT I'M I'M I'M CASTING A VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE TODAY WITH THE RELEASE OF PERSONAL COMMITMENT ON THAT FRONT I WOULD HOPE IS A BODY WE WE ACCEPT THAT MANSELL OURSELVES AND NOT TO NOT BE DONE SO THANK YOU SISTER AND OTHERS SENATE ALSO THANK YOU I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS -- FOR WORKING SO HARD THE MEASURE BUT I WANT TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS -- ONE IS AS SEVERAL HAVE SAID VOTING FOR THIS BILL PROTECTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS -- FROM EVICTION AND -- THEY'RE WAITING TO GET THE ASSISTANCE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND WE OWE IT TO THEM THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO -- I KNOW IN ADDITION TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET GOTTEN THE AID BUT WHO APPLIED IN ADDITION TO THEM THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WHO WE HAD ALREADY ASSISTED ME I WANT TO THANK THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO WORKED REALLY REALLY HARD FOR THE OUTREACH ON SATURDAY AND IN MY AREA AND CENTRAL LOS ANGELES WE HAD ANOTHER HOUSING FAIR IN WHICH A HUNDRED SEEMS LIKE SMALL BUT A HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE ASSISTED THE HAD NOT DONE IT BEFORE ONE IS WERE SOME SENIORS WHO ARE UNSURE HOW TO DO IT -- TO THE INTERNET -- THERE ARE THOSE WHO DISTRUST GOVERNMENT NOT SURE WHAT IT MEANT DO THEY HAVE TO PAY IT BACK THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF OF REASONS FOR THAT -- BUT I KNOW THAT -- THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN -- HAVE BEEN ASSISTANT I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP ON WORKING TO PROTECT ANYBODY NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO FACE EVICTION AND SO I THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT JUST SAY WELL THAT'S THE END ON MARCH THIRTY FIRST THAT'S THE END OF IT ALL BUT RATHER AND LET ANY -- LANDLORD THAT USES THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVICT KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND THEY WILL BE ATTORNEYS DEFENDING THOSE TENANTS IF IT'S DONE IN UNFAIR AND ILLEGAL WAY WE WE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE FACING EVICTIONS -- AND I THINK THAT WAS THE WHOLE THING SO I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THERE IS WILL THERE IS STILL ASSISTANCE OFFERED LEGAL AID -- WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT INFORMATION GETS OUT AGAIN I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY LANDLORD WHO IS A TRIES TO ABUSE ANY VICT -- REALLY KNOWS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ATTORNEYS DEFENDING THOSE TENANTS OF THE MOMENT THAT THAT THEY NEED IT GOT SEVENTY TWO HOURS WHETHER IT'S A HUNDRED OR WHETHER IT'S THE THOUSANDS OF THAT MANY MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE I WOULD LIKE TO FEEL A WHOLE LOT MORE COMFORTABLE -- IN NEGOTIATIONS YOU DON'T GET EVERYTHING BUT WE FOUGHT LIKE HELL AND I THINK WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT LIKE HELL FOR THOSE TENANTS MOVE THE BILL THANK THANK YOU THE SERVICE OF THE THREE DIGIT CODE YES YES THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SIR WHAT HOUSEKI CENTER COAST MOVES WILL OTHERS WISHING COMMON NO ALL RIGHT WHAT ONE FINAL COMMENT THE RESPONSE OF THE WHAT'S CENTER WIENER SAID I THINK ABOUT HEARD YOU CORRECTLY SO THE JOIN US IS YOUR FAVORITE LEGISLATORS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE SENATE JUST A NOTE THAT THAT THAT THEIR MOM LONG AMONG

GIVE THE AUTHORS AN UPTURN OLD CLOTHES WHICH WHAT CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND SENATOR WINNERS AMONG -- ONE OF MY APPS OF ALL TIME -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS OBVIOUSLY ROAD TO PAVE AND MOVE FORWARD AND IT'S FOOT -- MANY MANY FOLKS IN A IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MUST DO AS WAS ALREADY STATED DOING SOMETHING IS BETTER THAN DOING NOTHING AND IT'S THROUGH THE CHAIR FOR -- MY JOIN AUTOMATE CLOSE AS WELL -- THANK YOU I'VE NINE FAVORITES HERE ON THE COMMITTEE TODAY THANK YOU FOR HAVING US -- I JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION HAS BEEN EXPRESSED BY SO MY COLLEAGUES I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR AND YOU ARE CORRECT I THINK THE THE PROGRAM THE LIMITATIONS OF LANGUAGE HAS BEEN HAVE BEEN REAL AND THAT IS FOR SO IMPACTS OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW I THINK SENATOR WIENER YOU RAISE SOME EXCELLENT POINTS AS WELL AROUND THE PENSION PIECE THAT I'VE HEARD AS WELL AND I SHARE THOSE THINGS AND I ALSO BELIEVE -- YOU KNOW WE COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB THE ADMINISTRATION COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB WE HAVE TO ASK SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS NOW IN TERMS OF HOW ARE WE EFFECTIVELY SERVING OUR CONSTITUENTS AS GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW I'M A DEMOCRATICALLY GOVERNMENT CAN HELP PEOPLE WELL THEN WE NEED TO DO OUR JOB AND DO DOING THAT AND HELP THE MOST PEOPLE WE POSSIBLY CAN AND I THINK WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT HELPS THOSE COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE QUEUE YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO HONOR THAT COMMITMENT THOSE FOLKS HAVE HAVE PUT FORTH THEIR APPLICATION THEY ARE WAITING ON THESE FUNDS THOSE FUNDS ARE CRITICAL WE NEED TO DO THAT BUT I ALSO THINK THIS TO SENATOR STERN'S -- COMMENTS THIS SHOULD BE A CALL TO ACTION TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THESE FOLKS ARE SOME OF THE MOST UNDERSERVED PEOPLE IN OUR STATE AND WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS AND I'VE USED YOU HOUSING SECURITY AS AS A MORAL ISSUE WHEN WE SEE THE HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE TO COMBAT THAT SO WITHOUT THIS BILL I DO WORRY WE WILL SEE A MASS WAVE OF EVICTIONS THAT IS WHAT IS ON THE LINE HERE AND I WELCOME AND SENATORS ARE ALSO IN THE FIGHT FIGHT LIKE HELL ATTITUDE AND LET US ALL THINK ABOUT HOW WE CONTINUE HOUSING POLICY WE CONTINUE HOUSING PRODUCTION WE CONTINUE TO HELP OUR TENANT TENETS BECAUSE WHAT KOBE DID IS IT SHINED A SPOTLIGHT ON SOMETHING IS ALREADY HAPPENING THE

THE CLASSROOM MY PARENTS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY LIKE SO MANY OTHERS IN SEARCH OF BETTER LIFE MY PARENTS CAME AS GRADUATE STUDENTS -- AND THEY CHOSE AMERICA FOR THE SAME REASON A LOT OF -- HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS COME TO THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF OUR EXCEPTIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY AMERICAN HIGHER IT IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD NOT JUST TODAY BUT THROUGHOUT ALL TIME AND I THINK IT'S ALSO SAFE TO SAY THAT OUR ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE ARE THE BEDROCK OF OUR ACADEMIC EXCEPTIONALISM IN THIS COUNTRY -- THE PURPOSE OF HIGHER EDUCATION AS WE KNOW IS TO GROW INTELLECTUALLY IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THIS ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS MUST PROVIDE A SETTING THAT ENCOURAGES CHALLENGING ONE'S ASSUMPTIONS AND BELIEFS ABOUT THE WORLD AS A FORMER PROFESSOR MYSELF AT UC IRVINE HI I AM WONDERING THE SAME THING ON HERE YEAH YOU GUYS ARE -- AT THE WRONG HEARING I THINK THAT THANK YOU MODERATOR WE MAKE CERTAIN THAT THAT LINE IS CLOSED AS A FORMER EDUCATOR MYSELF I KNOW THE ROLE OF AN EDUCATOR IS TO FACILITATE A FULL AN ROBUST DISCUSSIONS WHICH REQUIRES AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE SOMETIMES THEY'RE UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS DISCUSSED WHERE SOMETIMES THERE IS AN OPEN BUT RESPECTFUL DEBATE BETWEEN OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS AND THAT HAS TO START WITH EDUCATORS THEMSELVES ACADEMIC FREEDOM AS THE SUN AS DEFINED BY THIS RESOLUTION WOULD MEAN THE FREEDOM OF FACULTY TO TEACH CONDUCT RESEARCH AND SPEAK AS CITIZENS WITHOUT INTERFERENCE ARE RESTRAINED BY INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TOP POLITICAL FIGURES ARE ON THE OTHER ENTITIES -- WE CANNOT BE ACADEMIC

WOMEN'S STUDIES AT HILL COLLEGE YESTERDAY HE HAS LONG RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM IT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO ENSURING THAT HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS FUNCTION PUBLIC FOOD BECAUSE IT CREATES THE CONDITIONS FOR THE UNFETTERED ADVANCEMENT OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIRST TWO TO THREE ON THE BACK OF THEM FREEDOM SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH THE PROVISION FOR FREE SPEECH GUARANTEED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT FREEDOM OF SPEECH PROTECTS FROM INFRINGEMENT OF SPEECH BY THE GOVERNMENT ACADEMIC FREEDOM IS THE FREEDOM OF TEACHING FACULTY TO TEACH CONDUCT RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF THE OUT INTERFERENCE OR RESTRAINT BY THEIR INSTITUTIONS FOR TRUCKS YOU FOR THE CALL FIGURES OR OTHER ENTITIES ACTUALLY MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND THIS IS NOT THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE THE PERSONAL POLITICAL VIEWS ON STUDENTS NOR COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY REGULATIONS SAID ANY FORM OF PROFESSIONAL INCOMPETENCE OR EACH UP OTHER SUBJECT MATTER OR THE OFFICIAL COURSE SOMEONE OF RECORD IN RECENT YEARS MANY FACULTY AND FACULTY ORGANIZATIONS THAT FOCUS ON RESEARCHING HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WELL THERE ARE GOOD NOR BY MUCH OF ACADEMIA THIS IS LEADING TO A GRADUAL DECOMPOSITION OF THE CURRICULUM WHICH IS OFTEN BASED ON PATRIARCHAL YOUR APPEAL EUROCENTRIC IDEAS I DON'T THINK TO WIN BATTLES AGAINST THE TEACHING OF CRITICAL RACE THEORY OF ANTI RACISM UNEVENNESS OF THE WORK DAY IN THE CLASSROOM REPAIRS FOR CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO DISTINGUISH ITSELF PROVIDE PROTECTING THE CLASSROOM OF THE STATE FOR THE ROBUST EXCHANGE IDEAS AND IT'S FOR THESE REASONS OF THE

STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND TENURE BECOME THE STANDARD AND DEFINED ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND THE FREEDOM FOR FACULTY TO CONDUCT RESEARCH THE FREEDOM TO DISCUSS THEIR SUBJECT IN THE CLASSROOM AND THE FREEDOM FROM INSTITUTIONAL CENSORSHIP WHEN THEY THINK IT'S THE BEST ACADEMIC ACADEMIC FREEDOM ENABLED FACULTY TO DECOLONIZE THE CURRICULUM AND MANY HAVE MADE EFFORTS TO DO SO HOWEVER THOSE SAME FACULTY MEMBERS FOUND THEMSELVES A PATH AND OFF ON SOCIAL MEDIA BY THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH THEM I'M HERE PART TIME FACULTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS ARE THE MOST AT RISK OF THE THE TASK AT COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS THE FACULTY MEMBER HAD HER SYLLABUS WHICH ENCOURAGES STUDENTS TO TAKE A WHITE PRIVILEGE QUIZ POSTED TO THE REDSTATE WEBSITE ALONG WITH HER PERSONAL CONTACT INFORMATION SHE WAS

OPPOSITION GIVEN OPPOSITION UP AT OUR FORTY FIVE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO IN THAT ONE AND THEN THERE UP IN OPPOSITION HERE WE HAVE NOT POSITION IF YOU AT THE TIME K. -- HAVING GONE OUT TO THE PUBLIC BRING IT BACK TO YOU WITH THE DAIS -- ANY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE WISHING TO COMMENT PROPOSED QUESTIONS THE NILE THE JUMP IN FIVE CENTERMAN I'D AS A AS SOMEONE WITH A BACKGROUND IN ACADEMIA I APPRECIATE AND I'VE CERTAINLY VALUE IT I THINK WHEN WE HAVE A DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT -- IT IS SUCH AS WE TRY TO FOSTER IN LAW SCHOOL AND FRANKLY ANY -- ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT IT HELPS WHEN STUDENTS ARE CHALLENGED IN YOU HAVE PROFESSORS -- WILLING TO PUT FORWARD IDEAS NOT NECESSARILY -- -- OF THEIR OWN LIKING BUT ONE DESIGNED TO YOU KNOW GENERATE CONVERSATION TO TO QUESTION AND PUSH AND PROD DODD TO DEVELOP THESE CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS ANALYTICAL THINKING PROCESS IS I THINK ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AS OPPOSED TO OTHER PLACES WHERE IT TENDS TO BE MORE LECTURE STYLE OR IS MORE ENGAGING CORRECT MY MY ARMS AROUND THE NECESSITY FOR THIS BECAUSE SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT I HEARD FROM FOLKS -- THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT -- A SYLLABUS PUTTING PROUD BEING PUT OUT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND THEN SOMEBODY YOU KNOW BEING CASTIGATED AND IN SOCIAL MEDIA HOW WOULD THAT PERTAIN TO ACADEMIC FREEDOM BECAUSE IS THAT NOT INTIMIDATION BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AS OPPOSED TO THE ACADEMIC SETTING YEAH WHICH ISN'T TOTALLY DIFFERENT VENUES THE POLICE HAVE BEEN -- SERVER SO I I AGREE WITH YOUR ELOQUENT REMARKS ON THE IMPORTANCE ECONOMIC FREEDOM HAVING TIÃU WE ARE BOTH FORMER PROFESSORS -- AND WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE AS HE SAID OF OF GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR COMFORT SOME OF THE ROBUST DISCUSSION THAT THAT MIGHT MAKE PEOPLE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE OF MY CHALLENGE SOME OF THEIR EXISTING WORLDVIEWS OF THAT IS AT THE HEART OF AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION IT'S YOU KNOW AT THE HEART OF CRITICAL THINKING -- AND I DO THINK THIS RESOLUTION IS NECESSARY TO AFFIRM THE STATE'S BELIEVING THAT BELIEF IN ECONOMIC FREEDOM -- UNFORTUNATELY SEEING A RISE IN ATTACKS ON PROFESSORS ON TENURE PROFESSORS IN PARTICULAR IS ONE OF MY WITNESSES POINTED OUT I THAT IS OFTEN LEADS TO DISCIPLINE OR CONSEQUENCES FROM THE GOVERNING BOARDS OR -- ACADEMIC -- -- THE THE THE SORT OF A THE FOLKS IN CHARGE OF THESE INSTITUTIONS -- IN RESPONSE TO THE POLITICS WE SEEN IT AROUND THE STATE WE'VE SEEN AROUND THE COUNTRY -- AND UNFORTUNATE THING -- ON BOTH THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO TRY TO IDENTIFY AND TAKE OUT OF CONTEXT REMARKS THAT MIGHT BE VIEWED AS OFFENSIVE TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF GROUPS AND THERE'S COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF THESE I THINK MY WITNESSES HAVE MADE IT MAY HAVE SOME OF THESE AND READY AT HAND BUT -- YOU KNOW AT A TIME WHEN WE DO SEE A RISE WITH LIBERTARIANS A RISE OF ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO LIMIT FREE SPEECH AND DISSENT SPEECHES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US AS A BODY HERE TO REAFFIRM VERY LOUDLY AND CLEARLY THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT JUST FREE SPEECH BUT ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND THE ABILITY AND FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE OF OUR EDUCATORS IN HIGHER ED TO BE ABLE TO SEE -- YOU KNOW THINK FREELY TO PROMOTE A HEALTHY DIALOGUE IN THEIR CLASSROOMS TO RESEARCH WHAT THEY LIKE TO DO WITHOUT FEAR OF REPERCUSSIONS BECAUSE THEIR VIEWS ARE THE DISCUSSION THEY'RE PROMOTING MIGHT MIGHT OFFEND SOMEBODY THAT I THINK THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT I'LL I'LL I'LL DRAW THIS TO TO A CLOSE ONE OF THE ALL OF THE FOLKS WHO COMMENTED TALKED ABOUT DECOLONIZING ACADEMIA I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WAS BORN YESTERDAY THINKING THAT AND I'LL THROW OUT SOME SOME SOME NAMES OF UNIVERSITIES JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU HAD A -- A CENTER LEFT PROFESSOR GOING TO HILLSDALE COLLEGE TO TEACH -- OR IF YOU HAD BECAUSE CENTER RIGHT PERSON HEADING OVER TO THE BERKELEY THERE IS ABSOLUTE VALUE IN HAVING STRONG DIVERGENT OPINIONS AS PART OF THE MARKETPLACE OF ACADEMIC IDEAS BUT WHAT I'M I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT WITH THIS IS THAT WE ARE CREATING AN ISSUE THAT IS IN A DIFFERENT JURISDICTION YOU CAN'T THROUGH ACADEMIC FREEDOM INSTILL CIVILITY YOU CAN'T THROUGH ACADEMIC FREEDOM FACEBOOK YOU CAN'T THROUGH ACADEMIC FREEDOM -- TO EXPAND ACADEMIC PROTECTIONS IN A UNIVERSITY SETTING THAT ALREADY EXIST SO I GUESS MY POINT IN ALL THIS IS SHOULD WE JUST BE REINVIGORATING THE PROVISIONS OF THE UCC ISSUE AND NUMEROUS PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE BOLD BLACK -- GRAB SOME PROVISIONS ON THE IMPORTANCE IN SANCTITY OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM AS OPPOSED TO PUSHING YOU KNOW DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AND IN THE LATEST SET OF BUZZ WORDS ARE POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT IF I BELIEVE YOU CAN COMMENT YEAH I'LL TRY TO BRIEFLY FROM A PERSONAL AYE GROUPS ON THE SEASON'S ISSUES AT THIS -- PARTICULAR RESOLUTION APPLIES TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- AND I ACTUALLY DO THINK YOU KNOW LOOK THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH OUR SOCIETY TODAY THIS RESOLUTION DOES NOT SOLVE ALL THOSE PROBLEMS BUT IT IT TENDS TO PUSH IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ON ONE ISSUE WHICH IS ECONOMIC FREEDOM WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AMONG EDUCATORS AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU'VE JUST STATED VERY ELOQUENTLY -- NOW AND NOW I GUESS I STILL ACTING CHAIR BORDERS MEAN PORTENTS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM IN PROMOTING DIALOGUE AND AND HELPING TO FURTHER THE EDUCATION OF OUR YOUNG STUDENTS SO -- I THINK THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL I AND I DO HOPE IT FURTHERS IN ADVANCES THE TYPES OF ABSOLUTE PROTECTION SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PROFESSOR PARTICULAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROFESSORS MANY OF WHOM ARE ADJUNCTS WHO HAVE LESS JOB PROTECTIONS THAN TENURED PROFESSORS THAT YOU SEASON SEE ISSUES DO FEEL RELUCTANT TO SPEAK OUT DO FEEL RELUCTANT TO TEACH THEIR CLASSES IN A WAY THAT MIGHT BE PEDAGOGICALLY MOST SOUND BECAUSE THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POLITICIZATION OF SPEECH TODAY OF THE POLITICIZATION OF THE CLASSROOM -- AND I THINK IT'S VERY IN A VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR BODY -- TO REAFFIRM VERY LOUDLY OUR STATE THAT THE ACADEMIC FREEDOM AGAIN IS NOT GONNA SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS I CAN SOLVE FACEBOOK BUT IT WILL HELP PROMOTE BETTER EDUCATION AMONG OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU FOR I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR OF THINGS AND MOVE THE RESOLUTIONS ARE YOU THANK YOU SURFBOARDS THANK YOU CENTER WACO SCANNING THE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SEEING NONE OF WHICH LIKE CLOTHES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND I APPRECIATE THE HELP THE

NINE FORTY -- CLOSE THE DOOR ON THOSE WHO NEED MORE ATTAINABLE HOUSING OPTIONS ACROSS THE STATE THIS IS ALL HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME THE GOVERNOR'S ALLOCATING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO PURCHASE PARKS FOR RESIDENTS IF THIS BILL PASSES THE PRICE OF THOSE PURCHASES WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE STATE WE BELIEVE SHOULD INCENTIVIZE AND ENCOURAGE MORE HOUSING OPTIONS IT SHOULDN'T END THE MANUFACTURED HOUSING AS AN OPTION FOR CALIFORNIA FOR THESE REASONS THAN THOSE LISTED IN OUR LETTER WE RESPECTFULLY SENATOR LAYERED AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MUST OPPOSE YOUR BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER WYSOCKI MISTER WALKER THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AT CHASE AND I OCCURRED -- WITH ADULTS DEAN GILBERT ROBESON'S SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE ALL ECHO THE BIRTHDAY WISHES TO THE SENATOR BEST NOT TO REPEAT MR WHY SAKI'S TESTIMONY THE THE THE RENT CONTROL EXEMPTION THAT WE'RE DEBATING IN THIS BILL TODAY HAS BEEN REFERRED TO AS A LOOPHOLE AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF C. MPAS MEMBERS WE DO IT IS REALLY THE LAST INCENTIVE FROM THE STATE TO BUILD OUT AND THAT WAS WHAT MISTER WYSOCKI WAS REFERRING TO THE MOBILE HOME PARKS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM APARTMENTS AND A LOT OF WAYS AND AND AND ONE WAY IS THAT WHILE WE CONTINUE TO BUILD TENS OF THOUSANDS OF APARTMENT UNITS EVERY YEAR IN THE YEAR WE DON'T HAVE A A NET LOSS OF SPACES IN MOBILE HOME PARKS WE MIGHT BUILD TENS OR HUNDREDS IT'S BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE PROPONENTS AND ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE AUTHOR WE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE PEOPLE HOUSE MOBILE HOME PARK SO IT'S NOT JUST THE VALUE OF MY CLIENT BECAUSE OF SELF INTEREST IT'S BEEN THE LONG STANDING VALUE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS COMMITTEE YOU KNOW SIMPLY WITHOUT THIS EXEMPTION THE PARK OWNERS THAT WE REPRESENT THE ONES THAT HAVE TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS TO ACTUALLY BUILD OUT NEW SPACES AND EXPAND THEIR PARKS THEY DON'T FEEL THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE THE CERTAINTY NECESSARY TO DO THAT FOR THOSE REASONS HAVE TO BE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER JUST A NOTE I WANT TO MAKE MISTER WYSOCKI FEEL BETTER BY MISPRONOUNCING YOUR NAME AS WELL SO OUR PLACES OPPOSITION HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM SEEING NONE ARE ON THE PHONE BUT IF YOU TWO OF THOSE ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION ONE BEN ZERO ON YOUR PHONE OPPOSITION ONE NINE ZERO AND WE DO HAVE A COUPLE YEAR QUEUING UP JUST A MINUTE ONCE AGAIN THAT IS IN OPPOSITION WE WILL GO DOWN THE LINE YOUR FIFTY FIFTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN FIFTY SIX YES -- GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CORINNE GREASY ON THE AFTER THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN OPPOSITION RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING OF OF THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU AND WE DO HAVE ONE MORE IN THE QUEUE AND IF THAT WILL BE HERE AND I THINK IT NEVER LINE NUMBER FIFTY EIGHT EIGHT FOUR HAD HI MY NAME IS MARYLAND GREEN AND I AM -- WITH PLANTATION ON THE LAKE WHICH IS A FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN BEAUTIFUL MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITY AND CALIMESA CALIFORNIA WHEN WE BOUGHT THE PARK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX NO MATTER WHAT YOU HUNDRED EIGHTY MA'AM GO HEAD JUST STATE YOUR NAME YOUR FILIATION AND YOUR POSITION OKAY MY NAME IS MARYLAND GREEN -- I'M WITH PLANTATION ON THE LAKE -- HI I'M REPRESENT THE OWNERS AND FIFTY SEVEN ARE YOU FAMILIAR FASTER IN YOUR YOUR POST YOUR POST OF THE BILL ALL RIGHT LET'S GO LET'S GO NOW IS ANOTHER CALLER NO OTHER CALLERS MODERATOR ANYONE ANYONE ELSE IN THE QUEUE IN OPPOSITION THERE IS NO OTHER IN THE QUEUE FOR OPPOSITION AS OF RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE CENTER BOARD JUST THANK YOU CHAIR I HAVE COLLEAGUES BILLS IT OF LATE AND -- I SO I THINK WITH THERE'S A FIRST MORE COMMON GROUND THAN ONE MIGHT EXPECT IS NOT ONE OF THEM AND I'M TRYING TO MAKE SENSE THERE SEEMS TO BE A DRAMATIC INTERNAL INCONSISTENCY HERE MEANING THAT I WON LEVEL YOU WANT TO DELEGATE IN RESPECT LOCAL CONTROL WHEN MATTERS ARE WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES BUT IF THOSE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE NOT DOING THINGS THE WAY THAT YOU WISH TO BE DONE THEN THE STRONG ARM OF THE STATE NEEDS TO STEP IN IN THIS SITUATION YOU'RE DIPPING YOUR TOES INTO POND SIMULTANEOUSLY YOU'RE REMOVING LOCAL CONTROL WHEN YOU DON'T LIKE THE RESULT AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO OVERRIDE LOCAL CONTROL AFTER TEN YEAR TIME PERIOD OF TIME AFTER CONSTRUCTION NEW CONSTRUCTION IS BUILT SO THIS REALLY IS KIND OF A HODGE PODGE -- THAT THE RESULT YOU WANT IS ALREADY DETERMINED IN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RATIONALE TO REVERSE ENGINEER AND I'M FINDING THAT THIS IS REALLY GOING TO CREATE NOT ONLY MORE CONFUSION THE MARKET PLACE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS THINKING THEY HAVE A WINDOW OF TEN YEARS WITHIN WHICH TO BUILD AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT INVESTMENT -- BUT WAIT YOU KNOW LIKE AN INFOMERCIAL THERE'S MORE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THE MONEY THAT YOU PROJECTED OUT WHICH IS THE UNDERPINNING OF MAKING THE INVESTMENT TO BEGIN WITH SO I'M REALLY HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THIS ONE FOLKS IF WE DO BELIEVE IN HOUSING THEN WE NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT HOUSING IS SOMETHING WE PUT AS A PRIORITY AND MAKE IT EASY FOR FOLKS TO DO IF WE BELIEVE THAT RENT CONTROL IN LOCAL AUTHORITY IS SOMETHING THAT WE BELIEVE IN THEM ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN BUT THIS HODGE PODGE IS GOING TO HAVE THE EXACT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT IN MY IN MY OPINION I THINK -- WE HAVE SEEN THAT MOBILE HOMES HAVE BEEN ATTACKED FOR THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS IT REALLY BASED ON HOUSING WARS BECAUSE IN CERTAIN INSTANCES LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ALLOWED -- TO CRAFT EXEMPTIONS BECAUSE THEY WITH THEIR WISDOM OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT IN THE INSIGHTS OF THEIR COMMUNITY DEEM THIS IMPORTANT -- TO KEEP FOLKS INVESTING AND REINVESTING I'M ABSOLUTELY BEFUDDLED WITH THE LOGIC OF THIS OF THIS BILL -- -- -- I WON'T BE IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT IT BUT I I REALLY DO ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY REALLY WANT TO LOOK AT HOUSING WHAT DIRECTION WE WANT TO GO TO THE WANT RENT CONTROL OR DO THEY WANT -- TO INSPIRE HOUSING -- IF YOU WANT TO INSPIRE HOUSING YOU CAN'T REVERT BACK TO LOCAL -- -- BRING CONTROLS JUST PICK A SIDE WAS THAT A QUESTION OKAY THEN I'LL ANSWER MY CLOTHES MISTER CHARGES ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY KASKI I THINK I THINK I UNDERSTAND THE RENT CONTROL PORTIONS AND WHY YOU HAVE TO TEN YEAR PERIOD THERE IN THE PARAGRAPHS ABOUT THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DIFFERENT OWNERS MAKES SENSE I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THE CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION'S A LETTER SISTERS VIRTUALLY BEEN NO CONSTRUCT NEW MOBILE HOME PARKS BUILT IN SIXTY YEARS ARE YOU WITNESSES SAYS THAT IN THE LAST THIRTY TWO YEARS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THE SPACES HAVE INCREASED BY ONE AND A HALF PERCENT SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN BUILDING A MOBILE HOME PARK AND YOU HAD CARP LAUNCHED TO BILLS AND CHARGE WHATEVER RIGHT YOU WANTED TO BECAUSE OF THE THE PROPONENTS CHARACTERIZATION THAT THEY THINK THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT COVERED BY ANY LOCAL RENT CONTROL SO I GET THAT YOU GOT A CITY THAT HAS RENT CONTROL BUT I COME IN WITH A NEW MOBILE HOME PARK I'M NOT SUBJECT TO THAT EVEN WITH THAT NOBODY IS BUILDING A NEW MOBILE HOME PARKS THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THERE'S VIRTUALLY HAS BEEN NO MOBILE HOME PARKS BUILT IN THIS THIRTY TWO YEARS SAID IT'S BEEN ANYTHING GOES SO HOW DOES PUTTING THE TENURE RECOVERY LIMIT ON THAT ACCELERATE THE CONSTRUCTION OF PARKS I KNOW WHAT THAT'S WHAT IT DOES BUT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT TO THE I GUESS IT'S THE OPPOSITION IF YOU REALLY WANT IF YOU WANT RENT CONTROL I GET THAT BUT JUST ON BUILDING THE PARKS HOW WOULD ANYBODY DO THAT BUT THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT ALREADY HELLO I I'M GONNA TAKE THAT IS A QUESTION THAT WAS A CITIZEN RIGHT OKAY IS BECAUSE THE -- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONSTRUCTING APARTMENTS AND CONSTRUCTING MOBILE HOME PARKS BECAUSE IN APARTMENTS OR HOMES IT'S THE FULL DEAL YOUR YOUR WALLS ROOFS THE WHOLE BUSINESS IF YOUR MOBILE HOME PARK YOUR CONSTRUCTING HOOK UPS AND SPACES AND THE MOBILE HOME IS BROUGHT IN AND OWNED BY THE INDEPENDENT TENET AND SO IF THERE'S A FIFTEEN YEAR AS WELL AS TALK THROUGH THAT MAY WELL BE APPROPRIATED FOR BUILDINGS THE ENTIRE THING BUT IF YOUR -- DOING A PAD BUILDING HOOK UPS A TEN YEAR RECOVERY IS A FAIR RATE OF RETURN AND A LOGICAL TIME TO RECOVER THAT I MEAN I'M TALKING VOLUME I'M SAYING IN THIRTY TWO YEARS OF THE YEAR WITNESSES SENSORS ONLY ONE RIDER SENATE IT GETS TO THE PREVIOUS COMMENT TO IN A COUPLE OF VOICE AND AND ONE IS TO MAKE A CLEAR POINT BECAUSE IT MADE IT SOUND LIKE RENT CONTROL WAS BEING OPPOSED IMPOSE FROM THE STATE BY THIS IS A LOCAL CHOICE THAT MANY OF THESE SPACES DON'T HAVE RENT CONTROL BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A LOCAL CHOICE OF THAT GOVERNMENT NOT TO HAVE MOBILE HOME RENT CONTROL THIS IS NOT AN IMPOSITION OF IT THIS IS THE FACT THAT OF THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MOBILE HOME PARKS IN HER SPACE IS IN CALIFORNIA NINETY EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT COULD BE COVERED BY RENT CONTROL IF THERE IS A LOCAL RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE IN PLACE ONE AND A HALF PERCENT OR NOT BECAUSE OF SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE WAY PASSED THE BILL THE TO REALIZE THE RATE OF RETURN CAUSE FOR THE NINETY EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT IT IS BEEN A HISTORIC SOCIAL BARK THAT THERE IS A FAIR RATE OF RETURN THAT BECAUSE THE INVESTMENT AND CAUSTIC CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN THE PARK IN THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HOSTAGES BECAUSE THEY OWN A MOBILE HOME PARK AND IF THEY WERE YOU AFFECTED THEIR STOCK BECAUSE THEY OWN THE THING ON TOP OF THE SPACE AND IT GIVES THEM PROTECTION ON THE OTHER PLACE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IS FIXED THAT WORKS FOR NINETY EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT OF THE SPACES AND MORE AND WHEN THIS WAS ENACTED THIRTY TWO YEARS AGO I DON'T THINK IT WAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THAT ANYTHING CONSTRUCTED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WOULD BE CONSIDERED NEW IN PERPETUITY AS LONG SINCE AS THE RATE OF RETURN AND THE VALUE BEEN RECOVERED BY ANYBODY THAT INTERESTED IN THAT PERIOD THIS CATCHES IT UP BUT HAS YOU POINTED OUT THERE HASN'T BEEN A NEW ONE IN NINE YEARS THEREFORE THE OF THE ONE AND A HALF PERCENT THAT ARE COVERED THERE'S PROBABLY A LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY'LL FALL AT THE RATE OF RETURN ARE COME BACK TO THEM REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THIS LAW PASSES HERE TODAY AND I STILL THINK THERE'S THE INCENTIVE THERE BUT THE REASON IT HASN'T BEEN CONSTRUCTED IN MANY WAYS FOR REASONS THAT ARE WAY BEYOND THIS BILL AND IT IT IS LAND COST IT IS MANY OTHER THINGS AND IF WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN OTHER WAYS THIS IS ABOUT CATCHING UP THE LAW TO TO SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES ST JOHN'S THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I DON'T KNOW MISTER CHAIR IF THE AUTHOR I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THIS OR THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MIGHT WANT ANSWERED OR MAYBE BOTH TAKE A STAB AT IT BUT AS HAS BEEN STATED NINETY THERE THERE HAVEN'T BEEN WHAT WHAT ONE NEW PARK BUILT WHICH I ANY RATHER IT HAD BEEN ONE -- HOWEVER MANY NEW PARKS AND FOURTEEN FOURTEEN NEW PARK SINCE NINETEEN NINETY YES OKAY SO ACTUALLY SAID THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND SO IT'S PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT OKAY -- I I HAVE SHOWN AND -- SUPPORT FOR RENT CONTROL AND -- MOBILE HOME PARKS IN THE PAST MY HOME TOWN HAS AN ORDINANCE A COUPLE OF THE OTHER CITIES IN MY DISTRICT DO SOME OF THE CITY'S DON'T SO IT'S MAKES JUST LIKE YOU EXPLAINED -- AND YOU KNOW THE REASONS FOR MY SUPPORT OF RENT CONTROL MOBILE HOME PARKS IS IS NOT A MARKET SITUATION IT'S YOU KNOW THE THE TENANTS ARE TRAPPED IN YOU KNOW TO SOME DEGREE FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM ON THE LAND THAT THEY'RE RENTING AND -- YOU KNOW MANY OF THESE HOMES A STATE LAW HAS IS THEY'RE OLD ENOUGH TO STAY ALIVE DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO BE MOVED IF THERE WAS A NEW PARK TO OPEN UP FOR THEM FOR THERE TO BE A COMPETITIVE MARKET SO YOU KNOW I I THINK THE BEST THE PARKS IS EITHER FOR THE PARKS THE RESIDENTS THAT RENT THE SPACES TO OWN THE PARK OR FOR THE PARK OWNER THAT OWNS THE PARK TO ALSO OWN THE HOMES SO THAT EVERYTHING CAN BE ON AN EQUAL PLAYING GROUND A AND A FREE MARKET -- UNFORTUNATELY IN MANY CASES IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S NOT THE CASE SO -- WE'VE COME UP WITH AN IDEA TO PROTECT THE HOMEOWNERS -- AND -- AND HOPEFULLY GIVE A RATE OF RETURN TO THE PARK OWNERS MY QUESTION IS OF THE PARKS THAT HAVE OPENED UP SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THE RESIDENTS MOVING IN THEIR HOMES INTO THOSE PARKS WOULD KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT PROTECTED BY BREAKING TROLL AND THAT THEIR SPACE IS GONNA BE AT MARKET RATE WHATEVER THAT MARKET RATE IS INFERTILITY -- AS LONG AS THEY ON THAT MARKET SO COMMON OR AIM I MORE WHAT'S BEEN THE THE AGREEMENT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THE MOST COMMON AGREEMENT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY BETWEEN THE PARK OWNERS AND THE RESIDENTS THAT ARE MOVING THEIR HOMES INTO THOSE NEW PARKS ARE WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THE WITNESSES BECAUSE I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION -- IT WOULD THAT BE OKAY MISTER CHAIR FOR THE WITNESSES DANCER NOT SURE THANK YOU I THINK I DON'T THINK THE PROCREATE WOULD BE THE PARK OWNERS I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE ONE TAKE A SHOT AT THAT -- MR BY SAKE CAN ANSWER THAT BE GREAT -- IN A LETTER BUT I ALSO THINK IT BE APPROPRIATE FOR A YEAR YOUR SPONSOR ANSWERS WELL BUT FROM OUR STANDPOINT THIS IS ABOUT SPACES THIS IS AN ABOUT PARKS SPACES CONSTRUCTED SHOULD BE EXEMPT FROM STATEWIDE RENT CONTROL THEY SHOULD BE GRANDFATHERED IN UNDER THE EXISTING RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE WE WANT TO BUILD MORE SPACES THIS BILL UNDER A STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE WILL PREVENT THE ABILITY FOR OUR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY INCREASE THE SIZE OF THEIR ACTUAL PARKS ARE YOU SAYING NEWS I'M SORRY ARE YOU SAYING NEW SPACES IN EXISTING PARKS NEW SPACES IN EXISTING PARKS HIS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE OKAY BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ABILITY TO EXPAND WE'VE GOT SPACE IN A LOT OF OUR PARKS WE'VE GOT MAYBE TWENTY THOUSAND SPACES THAT COULD BE BUILT OVER NIGHT BUT THE DIFFERENCES IT TAKES UNLIKE AN APARTMENT BUILDING WHERE WE CAN BE FULLY OCCUPIED ON DAY ONE AND OF THE CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY WE HAVE TO GREAT WE HAVE TO PLAN WE HAVE TO ELECTRIFY AND WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY GET THE SPACE SEN IT OFTEN TAKES SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS FIRST SINGLES -- SINGLE HOME TO ACTUALLY BE PUT INTO A PARK AND IS IS IS THE MOST COMMON EXPERIENCE WITH THAT WITH THOSE NEW SPACES IS THE PARK OWNER OWNING THE MOBILE HOME THE THE HOME ALSO OR IS THE PARK OWNER RENTING THAT SPACE OUT TO SOMEBODY WHO MOVES A HOME ON TO THE SPACE USUALLY IT'S THE PARK OWNER INSTEAD RENTS RENTS THE SPACE A HOME IS BROADBAND GOTCHA OKAY THANK YOU SO AND IN A SENSE IF THE WITNESSES SUPPORT WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A SHOT I WAS GONNA ASK MISTER STANTON IF YOU HAD A COMMENT TO ASK THROUGH THE CHAIR IT'S OKAY WITH THE CHAIR YES CAN YOU HEAR ME I'D BE HAPPY TO YES WE CAN YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IF WE'RE TALKING HERE ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF IS SPACES THE WAY THAT THAT CANIKLI WORKS IN MY EXPERIENCE OF EPISODE I AGING AND SPECIALIZING IN MOBILE ONLINE BIGGEST INDUSTRIES THAT THE BID BY TI EIGHTY THE WAY THAT TYPICALLY WORKS IS THE PARK OWNERS RESPONSIBLE TO CERTAINLY GREAT THE SPACE RECOUP WHATEVER BRASSER TREAT YOUR PROPERTY AREA THEY'RE FIVE FEET IT'S ABOUT BEING TURNED INTO A BATTLE SPACE SOMETIMES IN FACT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS TAKING EXISTING SPACES AND JUST MOVING HOLES CLOSER TOGETHER SO THERE'S SOME GRADING THERE THERE CERTAINLY MAY BE A CONCRETE PAD THAT NEEDS TO BE CORD AND THERE ARE UTILITIES THAT NEED TO BE INSTALLED BUT TYPICALLY THE NEW HOME THAT COMES IN IS DELIVER ALL THE DEALER IS ACTUALLY ORDERING THE HOME FROM THE FACTORY AND PUTTING IT ON THE SPACE AT THE DEALER IN MY EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY PAYS A PORTION OF THE SET UP COSTS FOR THE SPACE INITIALLY THAT'S ALL NEGOTIATED WITH THE PARK OWNER THE COST TO CREATE A NEW SPACES CERTAINLY NOTHING LIKE THE COST CREATED YOU PARK WHERE YOU'RE CREATING ALL THE COMMENTARY FACILITIES OF THE ROADS SO FOR ARE WE JUST DON'T SEE THE COST OF THE SPACES BEING ANYTHING INTO THAT SO I THINK THE INVESTMENTS THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO RECOUP HERE IS REALLY IT'S BEEN A MESS COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT OF INCOME THE AMOUNT OF CASH FLOW IT'S GOING TO BE CREATED BY ADDING SPACES IN THE PARK IF THAT'S WHAT THE PARKLAND WISHES TO DO THAT I'LL SEE THIS AS A DISINCENTIVE AT ALL I THINK IT'S A PRETTY MINOR COST IF YOU WILL COMPARE TO ALL OF THE NEW CASH FLOW IT THIS NEW SPACE WILL CREATE THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT INPUT FROM FROM BOTH SIDES AND YOU KNOW I I JUST THINK IN NORWAY ARE IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW THAT HE THESE PARK OWNERS WE'VE WE'VE AND AND AND TO SOME DEGREE RIGHTFULLY YOU KNOW CONSTRAINED OWNERS CAN DO AND YOU KNOW I AS I STATED I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE MARKET AND THE MARKET HOLDING SOMEBODY CAPTIVE BUT IF SOMEBODY'S MOVING INTO THESE NEW SPACES AND THEY KNOW THAT THEIR WHAT THE SPACE RENTS GOING TO BE IN THE KNOW THAT THAT SPACE RENTS NOT GOING TO BE COVERED BY YOU'VE GOT A WILLING SELLER AND A WILLING BUYER I DON'T KNOW WHY THE STATE WOULD GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME -- SO THANK YOU FOR EFFORT OFFICIALLY THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BOB SEEING NONE ALL RIGHT SIR MOTION SO I'M SORRY MOTIONS CENTER STERN MOST THE BILL SANDLER WAS LIKE CLOSE YES THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION AND AND I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY THAT TESTIFIED OF THE CORPORATE APPRECIATE TO THREE A ROYAL GRANDY RESIDENTS FOR MY DISTRICT BUT -- I TESTIFIED AND I THINK IT PLAYING OFF OF A COMMENT THAT WAS RIGHT THERE ABOUT WISE INTO KNOWING SELLER KNOWING FIRE IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU'RE KNOWING YOU'RE GOING TO POTENTIALLY GET INTO A HOSTAGE SITUATION THAT IT IS NOT AS FREE WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND AND THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FAIR RATE OF RETURN TALKING ABOUT A MINUSCULE AMOUNT I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY INTENT TO WIN THIS WAS ADOPTED IN NINETEEN NINETY TO HAVE ANY HOUSING BUILT SINCE THAT DATE TO THE MOBILE HOME MORAL TO BE CALLED A NEW IN PERPETUITY I THINK THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT GEN AND I ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS THE FAIR RATE OF RETURN WITH THE TEN A YEAR OF OUR EXCLUSION AT THE BEGINNING I THINK THIS PRODUCT PROVIDES HOUSING PROTECTION TO PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST
