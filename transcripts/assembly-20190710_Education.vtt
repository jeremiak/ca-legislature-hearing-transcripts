CONCLUSIVE MEDICAL RESEARCH.

00:24:09.181 --> 00:24:10.315
THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE

EPIDEMIC IS EARLY SCHOOL START

00:24:12.584 --> 00:24:14.719

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:36.341
FROM LAST YEAR'S A BILL AND WE

00:24:36.408 --> 00:24:38.443
THINK IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.278
AMENDMENT.

00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:41.246
FROM LAST YEAR AND MAKES THE

BILL -- BETTER BECAUSE IT

00:24:42.881 --> 00:24:44.683

THEIR HIGH SCHOOLS AND THAT WAS

00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:51.056
A SUGGESTION THAT CAME UP AND WE

00:24:51.122 --> 00:24:52.924
THOUGHT IT WAS PRUDENT SO WE

00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:54.593
INCORPORATED INTO THE BILL --

00:24:54.659 --> 00:24:56.962
THIS COMES FROM A RECOMMENDATION

00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:13.511
THE VAST MAJORITIES OF

VULNERABLE TO SLEEP DEPRIVATION

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:48.580
BECAUSE THERE'S A BIOLOGICAL

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:49.914
SHIFT IN THEIR BRAINS RHYTHMS.

HAS FOUND THAT TO SLEEP DURATION

00:31:04.896 --> 00:31:06.998

00:31:32.323 --> 00:31:33.591
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT RESEARCH

OUR CHILDREN SLEEP HEALTH HAS

00:33:38.182 --> 00:33:38.750
FALLEN THROUGH A RESPONSIBILITY

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:39.183
GAP.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:40.551
DEFAULTING THIS IMPORTANT

00:33:40.618 --> 00:33:42.153
STATEWIDE PUBLIC HEALTH MATTER

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.654
TO OVER FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL

00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:45.556
SCHOOL BOARDS HAS PROVEN

00:33:45.623 --> 00:33:46.958
DETRIMENTAL TO CHILDREN.

00:33:47.024 --> 00:33:48.559
AFFECTING CHANGE AT THE LOCAL

00:33:48.626 --> 00:33:50.161
LEVEL HAS PROVEN VERY DIFFICULT

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:51.763
BECAUSE ALL OF THE STRUCTURAL

00:33:51.829 --> 00:33:53.297
BARRIERS THAT EXIST THERE. FOR

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:55.066
EXAMPLE MANY SCHOOL BOARDS DON'T

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:57.502
ACTUALLY HAVE THE FINAL SAY ON

00:33:57.568 --> 00:33:58.970
WHAT TIMES ARE SCHOOL START

00:33:59.036 --> 00:34:00.204
BECAUSE OF CONTRACT LANGUAGE

00:34:00.271 --> 00:34:01.706
WITH BARGAINING GROUPS WE

00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:03.141
SUPPORT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:04.675
BUT NOT FOR OUR KIDS HEALTH IS

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:05.943
JUST TOO IMPORTANT.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.445
AND ALTHOUGH ELLIE GAYS ARE

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:09.213
ACCOUNTABLE FOR A LOT THEY ARE

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.882
NOT ACCOUNTABLE FOR INCREASING

00:34:10.948 --> 00:34:13.551
TEEN SLEEP OR DECREASING DROWSY

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:15.153
DRIVING ACCIDENTS ETCETERA.

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:16.654
SO THE MANY EDUCATIONAL

00:34:16.721 --> 00:34:17.922
OBJECTIVES OVER WHICH SCHOOL

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:19.190

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:20.792
PRIORITIZED.

00:34:20.858 --> 00:34:21.859
BUT THE LEGISLATURE ON THE OTHER

00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:24.128
HAND ALL OF YOU CLEARLY HAVE THE

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:26.264
RESPONSIBILITY AND THE AUTHORITY

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:27.498

00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:29.133
FROM KNOWN PUBLIC HEALTH AND

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.202

00:34:31.269 --> 00:34:32.737
FILLED WITH SUCH PROTECTIONS.

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:33.871
AND BESIDES GIRLS ARE HARM TO

00:34:33.938 --> 00:34:36.207

00:34:36.274 --> 00:34:36.607
QUO.

00:34:36.674 --> 00:34:38.176
GIRLS ARE HARMED MORE BECAUSE

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.577

00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:40.912
CERNER AND AFRICAN AMERICAN

PUBERTY CENTER THAN WHITE GIRLS.

00:34:46.017 --> 00:34:47.385
WE BELIEVE EVERY CHILD DESERVES

00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:48.486
EQUAL PROTECTION FROM KNOWN

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:50.521
PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS AND NO CHILD

AND THAT ONE IT SAY THE THE

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:19.203
VIEWS THAT I'M EXPRESSING TODAY

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.471
OR FROM MY MORE THAN TWENTY

00:42:20.537 --> 00:42:22.172
YEARS IN RESEARCH AND SLEEP ON

OR SO ON ADOLESCENT SLEEP AS A

00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:26.043
SIGN TO THE UC DAVIS AND THEY

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:26.343
ARE MY OWN.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.244
AND NOT NECESSARILY THOSE

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:28.145
UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA HOPE YOU HAD

00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:29.480
A CHANCE TO READ THE LETTER THAT

00:42:29.546 --> 00:42:30.147
IRWIN FIND BURKE AND I WROTE IN

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:30.948
OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL ARE

00:42:31.015 --> 00:42:32.349
BRIEFLY REVIEW OUR REASONS FOR

00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:33.050
OPPOSING IT.

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:34.084
MANY ADOLESCENTS TO DO HAVE A

00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:35.252
CIRCADIAN PHASE DELAY THAT

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:36.186
CAUSES THEM TO PREFER A LATER

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:37.354
BEDTIME HOWEVER SLEEP SCIENTISTS

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:38.656
DO NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:39.790
PHASE DELAY.

00:42:39.857 --> 00:42:40.624
RATHER THAN THAT THE DELAY

00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:42.192
RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN BRAIN

00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:43.827
CIRCUITS THAT RGULATE CIRCADIAN

00:42:43.894 --> 00:42:46.063
RHYTHMS THE BEST EVIDENCE IS THE

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:47.164
ADOLESCENT SLEEP NEED

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:48.866
ACCUMULATES MORE SLOWLY ACROSS

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:50.367
THE DAY AND THIS ALLOWS THEM TO

00:42:50.434 --> 00:42:51.435
STAY UP LATER.

00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:52.870
A RECENT MODELING STUDY

00:42:52.937 --> 00:42:54.104
DEMONSTRATED THAT RATHER THAN

00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:55.739
ACCOMMODATING THE PHASE DELAY BY

00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:56.840
ALTERING SCHOOL START TIME A

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:58.842
MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACH IS TO

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:00.477
REDUCE EVENING LIGHT EXPOSURE.

00:43:00.544 --> 00:43:02.313
FURTHERMORE SLEEP RESEARCHERS DO

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:03.580
NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW SLEEP

00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:05.149
NEED CHANGES DURING ADOLESCENCE

00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:06.717
OUR LAB IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING

00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:08.953
AN NIH FUNDED STUDY TO ADDRESS

00:43:09.019 --> 00:43:09.687
THIS QUESTION.

00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:11.555
SECOND PROPONENTS FAILED TO IN A

00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:12.790
KNOWLEDGE OF THE EVIDENCE THAT

00:43:12.856 --> 00:43:14.725
THE INITIAL SLEEP IN THE INITIAL

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:16.026
INCREASE IN SLEEP DURATION

00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:17.428
FOLLOWING SCHOOL START TIMES MAY

00:43:17.494 --> 00:43:18.996
NOT PERSIST.

00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:20.631
IT IS REASONABLE TO ASK IF WE

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:22.933
DELAY START TIMES WANT TEENS

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:23.400
JUST STAY UP LATER.

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:25.269
A LONGITUDINAL STUDY FOUND JUST

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:26.503
THAT DELAYING PARTS HIGH SCHOOL

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.939
START TIME FROM SEVEN FORTY FIVE

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:29.473
EIGHT THIRTY AM.

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:30.841
PRODUCED AN INITIAL TWENTY

00:43:30.908 --> 00:43:32.409
MINUTE INCREASE IN SCHOOL AND

00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:34.144
SLEEP DURATION DUE TO A TWENTY

00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:35.079
MINUTE LATER RISE TIME.

00:43:35.145 --> 00:43:36.780
HOWEVER SIX MONTHS LATER

00:43:36.847 --> 00:43:38.582
BEDTIMES WERE ALSO DELAYED

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:44.288
TWENTY MINUTES RESULTING IN NO

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:45.823
CHANGE IN SLEEP DURATION.

00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:47.758
THIRD A NATIONWIDE STUDY

00:43:47.825 --> 00:43:48.392
ORIGINALLY CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:49.293
SHOWED THAT EIGHT THIRTY MAY NOT

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:49.860
BE THE APPROPRIATE LIMIT AND

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:50.761
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT APPROPRIATE

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:52.096
FOR ALL ALL SITUATIONS.

00:43:52.162 --> 00:43:53.097
THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN START

00:43:53.163 --> 00:43:54.164
TIME AND SLEEP DURATION.

00:43:54.231 --> 00:43:56.367
WAS STRONGEST PRIOR TO EIGHT AM

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:58.702
AFTER EIGHT AM THERE WAS NO

00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:01.071
RELATION BETWEEN STILL START

00:44:01.138 --> 00:44:02.339
TIME AND SLEEP DURATION.

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:03.440
THE AUTHORS RECOMMENDED MORE

00:44:03.507 --> 00:44:04.775
RESEARCH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:06.510
THE EFFECTS OF SCHOOL START TIME

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:08.178
CHANGES WE AGREE.

00:44:08.245 --> 00:44:09.179
INSTEAD OF COMPELLING SCHOOL

00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:10.447
DISTRICTS TO ADOPT THE STATE

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:12.249
MANDATED START TIME WE RECOMMEND

00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:13.584
THAT THE LEGISLATURE PERHAPS

STATE.

00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:18.689
PROVIDE GUIDELINES SO THAT

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:19.990
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WANT TO

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:21.258
DELAY START TIMES CAN COLLECT

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:22.826
APPROPRIATE DATA TO EVALUATE THE

00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:24.328
POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF

00:44:24.395 --> 00:44:26.096
THE CHANGE.

IN ORDER TO AVOID INSOLVENCY

00:45:10.274 --> 00:45:11.508

STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS PLEASE.

THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.636
BEHIND THE DíAS -- ALL KIND OF

00:52:52.702 --> 00:52:53.236
START OFF HERE WITH SOME OF MY

00:52:53.303 --> 00:52:55.539
THOUGHTS -- IN MY MIND A

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:56.907
PRACTICAL I'M I'M A PARENT OF

00:52:56.973 --> 00:52:59.009
TWO TEENAGERS.

00:52:59.075 --> 00:53:01.244
BUT A TEACHER FOR A LOT OF YEARS.

00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:03.046
AND YOU KNOW.

00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:04.147
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT YOU KNOW

00:53:04.214 --> 00:53:04.781
WE'VE HEARD OF THE NANNY STATE

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:06.349
I'M FEARFUL THAT THIS IS THE

00:53:06.416 --> 00:53:06.750
STAVING THE NANNY.

00:53:06.816 --> 00:53:09.553
RIGHT -- IN A AND I THINK THIS

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:10.754
MIGHT BE GOOD POLICY.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.657
AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL BUT MY

00:53:13.723 --> 00:53:14.591
CONCERN IS A SETTING THAT I MEAN.

00:53:14.658 --> 00:53:16.092
YES SETTING.

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:18.094
THE THE SCHOOL BELL FROM

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:19.829
SACRAMENTO AYE I JUST DON'T

00:53:19.896 --> 00:53:21.665
THINK WE KNOW EACH DISTRICTS.

00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:23.333
NEW ONCE IS ENOUGH TO SAY WELL

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.801
WE KNOW BEST AND THIS IS WHAT IT

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:25.969
SHOULD BE.

00:53:26.036 --> 00:53:27.537
ACROSS OUR STATE BUT AGAIN I'M

00:53:27.604 --> 00:53:29.573
NOT OPPOSED TO TO STARTING

00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:30.674
SCHOOL LATER AT ALL.

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.209
NOT AT ALL BUT I JUST THINK IT'S

00:53:33.276 --> 00:53:34.210
IT'S GOOD LOCAL POLICY.

00:53:34.277 --> 00:53:35.912
BUT NOT NECESSARILY GOOD STATE

00:53:35.979 --> 00:53:38.448
POLICY TO DESIGNATE THE START

00:53:38.515 --> 00:53:40.083
TIME FOR EACH SCHOOL DAY

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:41.184
COMMISSION WE SHOULD BE SENATE

00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:43.086
AND TIME AND TIME TO GET TO KNOW

00:53:43.153 --> 00:53:43.720
A LOT OF QUESTIONS YOU RESET THE

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:44.287
SCHOOL KELLER.

00:53:44.354 --> 00:53:45.589
I WISH SCHOOL STARTED AFTER

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:46.222
LABOR DAY HOW MANY OF YOU WISH

00:53:46.289 --> 00:53:47.691
THAT WOULD HAPPEN RIGHT BUT I'M

00:53:47.757 --> 00:53:49.359
NOT GOING TO SPONSOR A LAW. TO

00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:51.127
DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS

00:53:51.194 --> 00:53:53.930
THE PURVIEW OF A LOCALLY THAT'S

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:55.365
RIGHT NEXT YEAR ELECTED ELECTED

00:53:55.432 --> 00:53:57.701

00:54:09.713 --> 00:54:10.480
OKAY A SURF BOARD WISE I'VE

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.848
SHARED BEFORE MY DAUGHTERS IN

00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:12.482
THE SURF TEAM AT OUR LOCAL HIGH

00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.849
SCHOOL.

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:13.450
IN TWO DAYS A WEEK HER FIRST

PERIOD IS ACTUALLY AT SIX FORTY

00:54:15.619 --> 00:54:16.152
FIVE IN THE MORNING RIGHT SHE

00:54:16.219 --> 00:54:17.087
OPTS INTO THIS.

00:54:17.153 --> 00:54:17.654
AND SHE IS TO BE DOWN IN THE

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:18.254
WATER.

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:20.523
RIGHT AND SO FIRST HEARD HER

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:21.791
FIRST PERIOD IS ACTUALLY SIX

00:54:21.858 --> 00:54:22.425
FORTY FIVE IN THE MORNING COUPLE

00:54:22.492 --> 00:54:22.759
DAYS A WEEK.

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:25.629
AND SO SHE DOESN'T GO TO FIRST

00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:26.997
PERIOD AT SCHOOL AND AND THIS

00:54:27.063 --> 00:54:28.431
WOULD.

00:54:28.498 --> 00:54:29.199
YOU KNOW KILL THAT PROGRAM

00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:30.333
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.902
HAPPEN BEFORE SCHOOL THAT NOT

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:33.703
EVERYBODY'S AWARE OF AND AGAIN

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.071
SHE OPTS INTO THIS PROGRAM IS

00:54:35.138 --> 00:54:37.207
NOT MANDATORY THAT SHE'S ON THE

00:54:37.273 --> 00:54:37.507
SURF TEAM.

00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:39.409
BUT I AM VERY PLEASED THAT SHE

00:54:39.476 --> 00:54:40.677
IS I THINK IT BROUGHT SCHOOL

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:42.078
SPIRIT BILL SCHOOL COMMUNITY

00:54:42.145 --> 00:54:43.780
WHEN KIDS ARE ENGAGE IN SPORTS

00:54:43.847 --> 00:54:45.849
BEFORE OR AFTER SCHOOL -- SOME

00:54:45.915 --> 00:54:47.550
SCHOOLS HAVE AGRICULTURAL

00:54:47.617 --> 00:54:48.952
PROGRAMS OR CERTAIN PROGRAMS

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:50.820
THAT THEY DO UNIQUE THING THINGS

00:54:50.887 --> 00:54:52.155
THE MORNING I'M A CITY BOY.

00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:53.790
BUT FROM WHAT I KNOW YOU DON'T

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:54.290
KNOW COUNT THREE IN THE

00:54:54.357 --> 00:54:55.091
AFTERNOON.

00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:56.359
RIGHT YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN THE

00:54:56.426 --> 00:54:57.961
EARLY MORNING HOURS AND THIS

00:54:58.028 --> 00:54:59.362
AGAIN WOULD.

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:02.732
POTENTIALLY HARM SOME OF OUR AG

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:04.801
PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE -- IN

00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:05.802
A TRAIN THERE'S A SCHOOL IN

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:06.670
ORANGE COUNTY THAT I'M AWARE OF

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:08.672
THAT THEY HAVE TO SET.

00:55:08.738 --> 00:55:09.939
THE SCHOOL DAY ACCORDING TO WHEN

00:55:10.006 --> 00:55:11.341
A TRAIN GOES BY BECAUSE SO MANY

00:55:11.408 --> 00:55:13.810
CARS GET BACKED UP BY THIS TRAIN.

00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:15.578
SO AGAIN THERE'S JUST SO MANY

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:17.514
NUANCES ACROSS OUR STATE AND

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:18.848
HOUSE WAS OPERATING WHY THEY

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:20.550
OPERATE ON THE TIME TABLE THEY

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:21.918
DO THAT I DON'T THINK.

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:23.653
IT'S GOOD TO TO TO TO GET SET

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.689
THAT THAT THAT START TIME FROM

00:55:25.755 --> 00:55:26.756
SACRAMENTO I'M A MOMENT A LOCAL

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:28.091
CONTROL GUY I THINK A LOCAL

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:29.893
SCHOOL BOARD HAS THE EXPERTISE

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:30.627
TO DO THIS.

00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:32.362
WE'RE STATE THAT'S DIVERSE IN

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:34.364
PEOPLE YES BUT ALSO GEOGRAPHY

00:55:34.431 --> 00:55:37.634
AND THAT MEANS A LOT OF THINGS --

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:38.268
I MEAN WHY HAVE A SCHOOL BOARD

00:55:38.334 --> 00:55:39.502
AGAIN IT'S A QUESTION I ASK

00:55:39.569 --> 00:55:42.472
WORKING FAMILIES.

00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:43.073
RIGHT THIS IS GOING TO IMPACT

00:55:43.139 --> 00:55:43.540
THEM.

00:55:43.606 --> 00:55:44.607
AND I COME FROM A DISTRICT WHERE

00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:45.308
THERE WAS A LOT OF WORKING

00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:47.477
FAMILIES AND I KNOW THIS IS

00:55:47.544 --> 00:55:48.545
GOING TO FALL ON OKAY.

00:55:48.611 --> 00:55:51.081
TYPICALLY IS GONNA FALL ON THE

00:55:51.147 --> 00:55:52.048
WOMAN.

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:53.116
OKAY MY WIFE AT HOME WITH THE

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:54.484
KIDS RIGHT NOW I'M UP HERE RIGHT

00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:56.386
SHE SAYS HAVING A GOOD TIME.

00:55:56.453 --> 00:55:58.054
RIGHT BUT IT THIS BURDEN IS

00:55:58.121 --> 00:56:00.724
GOING TO FALL ON WORKING WOMEN.

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:03.026
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE MORE HEAVILY

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:03.526
THAN OTHERS.

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:05.128
I WAS GONNA COST CHILDCARE

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:06.596
ISSUES.

00:56:06.663 --> 00:56:07.163
PEOPLE HAVE TO GO TO WORK I

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.431
DON'T THINK.

00:56:08.498 --> 00:56:10.100
BUSINESS IS GONNA NOT OPEN

00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:11.468
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL DAY OR

00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:12.602
THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE THEIR

00:56:12.669 --> 00:56:13.570
START TIME BECAUSE THE SCHOOL

00:56:13.636 --> 00:56:14.304
DAY.

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:17.207
START TIME AT HAS STARTED --

00:56:17.273 --> 00:56:18.441
IT'S GONNA COST MORE MONEY AS

00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:19.542
IT'S BEEN OUTLINED FOR BUSES

00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:20.744
BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY A CERTAIN

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:21.644
WONDER YOU GOT TO GET KIDS TO

00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:22.378
SCHOOL RIGHT.

00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:23.446
YOU DON'T WANT THEM GOING TO

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:24.280
SCHOOL AT TEN THIRTY BECAUSE I

00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:25.448
JUST GONNA DRIVE IN LATER INTO

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:26.916
THE AFTERNOON WITH THE EARLY

00:56:26.983 --> 00:56:28.885
EVENING HOURS WILL BE AT SCHOOL

00:56:28.952 --> 00:56:31.354
SLEEP I THINK THE THE DOCTOR'S

00:56:31.421 --> 00:56:32.088
POINTED OUT THAT.

00:56:32.155 --> 00:56:33.256
THEN WHEN I HEARD AND SAY THE

00:56:33.323 --> 00:56:34.390
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT YEAH KIDS

00:56:34.457 --> 00:56:35.558
MIGHT HAVE SLEPT TWENTY MINUTES

00:56:35.625 --> 00:56:35.859
MORE THAN.

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:36.793
ALL OF SUDDEN THEY THEY WENT

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.228
ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES LATER RIGHT

00:56:38.294 --> 00:56:39.863
SO I I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS

00:56:39.929 --> 00:56:43.733
NECESSARILY GOING. TO LEAD TO

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:47.203
MORE -- SLEEP BACK TO THE BUSING

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:50.740
ISSUE WE WE HAVE KIDS OUT THERE

00:56:50.807 --> 00:56:52.509
ON A BUS IN THE DARK.

00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:53.109
RIGHT BECAUSE OF SOME OF THESE

00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:53.977
RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY

00:56:54.043 --> 00:56:55.078
WORK IN FACT WE HAVE SOME REAL

00:56:55.145 --> 00:56:56.412
COMMITTEES I THINK STILL HAVE A

00:56:56.479 --> 00:56:57.213
FORTY SCHOOL TO AWAIT.

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.448
RIGHT SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR

00:56:58.515 --> 00:56:59.282
THEM BECAUSE THEY ONLY HAVE A

00:56:59.349 --> 00:57:00.750
CERTAIN WINDOW TO TO TRANSPORT

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:01.518
KIDS IN THOSE THOSE ARE THOSE

00:57:01.584 --> 00:57:03.219
ARE SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUES A

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:03.720
KID SITTING OUT THAT.

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:04.721
A CHILD SITTING OUT IN THE SNOW

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:06.422
IN THE DARK I DON'T THINK THAT'S

00:57:06.489 --> 00:57:08.158
THAT THAT'S A HEALTHY SITUATION

00:57:08.224 --> 00:57:10.160
THE BLOCK SCHEDULE THAT HASN'T

00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:11.761
BEEN BROUGHT UP.

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:12.362
BUT I KNOW WITH MY DAUGHTER I

00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:15.064
THINK SHE'S TO BE A SCHOOL LIKE

00:57:15.131 --> 00:57:15.665
SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN FIFTY FIVE A

00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:16.332
COUPLE DAYS A WEEK AND EVERY DAY

00:57:16.399 --> 00:57:18.067
SHE GOES AT NINE THIRTY SO THIS

00:57:18.134 --> 00:57:19.536
WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE

00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:21.404
BLOCK SCHEDULE THAT THE BLOCK

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:23.473
SCHEDULE OFFICE OFFERS KIDS.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.842
STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS INTO AN

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:28.144
ADVANTAGE IN THE ALSO KIDS WHO

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:28.945
CREDIT RECOVERY MAKE UP THE BOX

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:30.747
IT WAS GREAT FOR THEM BECAUSE

00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:31.281
THEY CAN ACTUALLY TAKE X.

00:57:31.347 --> 00:57:31.581
RECURRENCE.

00:57:31.648 --> 00:57:32.182
SO MY FEARS OF THIS WAS THIS

00:57:32.248 --> 00:57:33.817
WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT.

00:57:33.883 --> 00:57:41.057
THE THE BLOCK SCHEDULE I HAVE

00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:41.457
ANOTHER CONCERN.

00:57:41.524 --> 00:57:42.926
OR OR THOUGHT MAYBE WE SHOULD

00:57:42.992 --> 00:57:44.494
JUST GONNA WRITE A BILL THAT HAS

00:57:44.561 --> 00:57:47.063
PARENTS PUT THEIR KIDS TO BED.

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:47.697
NINE AND A HALF HOURS BEFORE THE

00:57:47.764 --> 00:57:47.897
STE.

00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:49.566
IN THE SCHOOL STARTS WRITING IS

00:57:49.632 --> 00:57:52.602
REALLY KIND OF AN ISSUE THE

00:57:52.669 --> 00:57:53.203
BOILS DOWN.

00:57:53.269 --> 00:57:54.237
TO OUR PARENTS.

00:57:54.304 --> 00:57:54.938
YOU KNOW INTERACT WITH OUR

00:57:55.004 --> 00:57:55.638
CHILDREN SO SO SO THAT'S AN

00:57:55.705 --> 00:57:56.940
ISSUE THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE

00:57:57.006 --> 00:57:57.473
THAT'S COME UP AND IT'S AN

00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:57.740
UNKNOWN.

00:57:57.807 --> 00:57:58.341
AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA

00:57:58.408 --> 00:57:59.876
HAVE AN ANSWER. TO IT RIGHT NOW.

00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:01.344
WOULD IT HAS TO DO WITH EIGHTY A

00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:06.549
MINUTES YOU'VE GOT IT SAYS --

00:58:06.616 --> 00:58:07.584
WITH AN UNKNOWN HERE'S THE BILL --

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:08.151
AUTHORIZES JUSTER STRONGER

00:58:08.218 --> 00:58:09.552
CLASSES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:09.953
PEOPLE'S BEFORE.

00:58:10.019 --> 00:58:11.654
BEFORE THE START OF THE SCHOOL

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:14.557
DAY -- THAT DO NOT GENERATE ADA

00:58:14.624 --> 00:58:15.859
SO THE THE QUESTION IS HOW DOES

00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:16.893
THAT INTERACTS.

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.094
WITH THE SCHOOLS ABILITY TO

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:19.262
GENERATE EIGHTY EIGHT WILL THEY

00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:20.930
HAVE ENOUGH MINUTES AT THE END

00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:22.532
OF THE YEAR TO GENERATE ADEQUATE

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:23.600
ADA SO MAY.

00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:26.102
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON AT

00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:26.703
AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE

00:58:26.769 --> 00:58:27.303
ANSWER TO THAT THAT'S GOOD I

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:28.605
CAME UP TODAY AND IT'S GONNA

00:58:28.671 --> 00:58:28.805
TAKE.

00:58:28.872 --> 00:58:30.273
I DON'T THINK THAT YOUR INTENT

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.541
I'M SURE OF THAT WITH THAT THAT

00:58:31.608 --> 00:58:33.209
IS A QUESTION AND AGAIN I WHERE

00:58:33.276 --> 00:58:34.711
I COME FROM IS.

00:58:34.777 --> 00:58:38.047
AGAIN GOOD POLICY POR LAW.

00:58:38.114 --> 00:58:38.681
THAT'S JUST SIMPLY WORST AND I

00:58:38.748 --> 00:58:41.384
DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:43.586
ANY COMMENTS.

00:58:43.653 --> 00:58:44.053
MISTER KALRA.

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:46.022
THANK YOU MISS SHERRIN THANK YOU

YOUR EXPERIENCE AND OUR

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:49.592
HEARTFELT MEANINGFUL A COUPLE OF

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:51.094
QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR.

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.896
ONE I UNDERSTAND THIS AS EXAM TO

00:58:52.962 --> 00:58:54.898
RULE SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- WHICH

00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:56.499
WHICH I KNOW HAVE DIFFERENT

00:58:56.566 --> 00:58:58.368
TYPES OF ACTIVITIES.

00:58:58.434 --> 00:58:59.702
THAT -- SOME OF THE URBAN

00:58:59.769 --> 00:59:01.037
DISTRICTS MAY NOT.

00:59:01.104 --> 00:59:06.943
BE ENGAGED AND AND THEN TO THIS

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:09.946
LAST POINT OF OR THE WHO OPENED

00:59:10.013 --> 00:59:10.980
THE CHAIR TALKING ABOUT.

00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:11.547
YOU HAVING A SERVING CLASSIC

00:59:11.614 --> 00:59:12.181
EARLY IN THE MORNING AND WHAT

00:59:12.248 --> 00:59:13.583
THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF I THINK

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:14.584
IT'S ITEM FOR THAT SIMPLY SOME

00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:16.085
THE ANALYSIS AND AND LOOKING

00:59:16.152 --> 00:59:17.720
YOUR BILL THERE IS A AN EGG AN

00:59:17.787 --> 00:59:20.590
EXEMPTION OR AT LEAST -- THAT TO

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:22.225
ALLOW FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:23.192
PEOPLE IS TO BE GAUGES CERTAIN

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:25.094
ACTIVITIES SO -- THAT'S MY

00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:26.629
UNDERSTANDING I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:28.731
REQUIRES MORE CLARIFICATION AS

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:29.866
THIS MOVES FORWARD TO MAKE IT

00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:31.601
VERY CLEAR THAT THE KINDS OF

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:33.803
ACTIVITIES THAT -- THE CHAIR THE

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:34.737
CHAIR O'DONNELL IS REFERRING TO

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:36.339
WOULD STILL BE ALLOWED FOR YEAH

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:38.107
IF I COULD RESPOND. ZERO APPEARS

00:59:38.174 --> 00:59:40.576
EXAM I MEAN THAT THAT'S THAT'S

00:59:40.643 --> 00:59:42.145
THE WHOLE POINT -- IT WAS

00:59:42.211 --> 00:59:46.616
SOMETHING THAT -- THE PTA WAS

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:48.685
ADAMANT -- IN EXPRESSING BEFORE

00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:49.319
THEY CAME ON BOARD I AGREE WITH

00:59:49.385 --> 00:59:49.752

00:59:49.819 --> 00:59:52.388
THOSE OPTIONAL OPT IN.

00:59:52.455 --> 00:59:54.590
PROGRAM THEIR EXAMS YOU KNOW --

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:57.093
THAT'S THAT'S JUST WHAT THE LAW

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.728
DOES YOU KNOW IF IT NEEDS MORE

00:59:58.795 --> 01:00:00.997
CLARITY WILL BRING MORE BUT WE

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:03.132
THINK THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR -- AND

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:04.901
I'M HAPPY TO TO TRY TO TIGHTEN

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:07.003
THE LANGUAGE BUT YOUR CORRECT

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.438
ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE ZERO PERIOD

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:10.606
IS EXEMPT -- AN INTERESTING BY

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:12.675
PRODUCT WHAT SOME SCHOOLS

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:15.211
ACTUALLY SEE -- IS THAT

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:17.213
ATTENDANCE AT ZERO PERIOD -- TO

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.715
POSIT A BY PRODUCT THAT MORE

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:20.116
KIDS WILL OPT INTO THE

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:21.617
ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS.

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:23.553
AS ZERO PERIOD MOVES SO FOR

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:25.488
EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A CURRENT

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:28.358
SCHOOL THAT STARTS AT SEVEN

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:29.125
THIRTY YOUR APPEARANCE AT SIX

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:31.160
THIRTY A LOT OF KIDS WON'T.

01:00:31.227 --> 01:00:32.562
OPT INTO A SIX THIRTIES YOU'RE

01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:34.364
PRETTY PARTICULAR WE SEEN BOYS

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.899
MUSIC PROGRAMS WHEN THAT SCHOOL

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:38.901
MOVES TO EIGHT THIRTY AND ZERO

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:40.636
APPEARED GOES.

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:41.204
TO SEVEN THIRTY WE SEEN THE

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:42.171
NUMBER OF BOYS IN THOSE

01:00:42.238 --> 01:00:43.840
ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS OFTEN AGAIN

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:45.241
THAT'S VOLUNTARY.

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:47.010
BUT THAT'S A POSITIVE BY PRODUCT

01:00:47.076 --> 01:00:48.711
OF THAT BUT YOUR PEERS ARE

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:50.079
EXEMPT.

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:51.814
AND COMES UP EVERY TIME WE BRING

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:53.850
IT UP IN THE ANSWERS BUT YEAH SO

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:54.951
THAT JUSTICE ONE THAT

01:00:55.018 --> 01:00:55.985
CLARIFICATION AND I KNOW THERE'S

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:56.519
A THERE'S A A NUMBER OF

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:58.187
DIFFERENT STUDIES AND AND

01:00:58.254 --> 01:00:59.522
THEY'RE STILL -- MAYBE SOME

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:00.923
LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF DISTRICTS

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:03.993
THAT THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED --

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.495
DELAYED SCHOOL START -- EITHER

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:06.863
IN THIS STATE OR ANOTHER STATE

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:08.865
SENATE ACTUALLY DONE STUDIES ON

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:11.601
IT AND SO -- IF THIS BILL WERE

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:12.468
TO MOVE FORWARD IF IT EVER GOT

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:13.836
ENACTED INTO LAW I THINK THAT'LL

01:01:13.903 --> 01:01:15.505
BE IMPORTANT TO GET SOME OF THE

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:16.839
REPORT BACKS THE STUDIES AS THE

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:18.975
REAL IMPACTS BECAUSE I THINK

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:20.143
THERE'S TWO THERE'S TWO VERY

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:22.512
LEGITIMATE -- OPPOSING OPINIONS --

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:25.815
BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE THE

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:28.084
THE THE THE SCIENCE AND AND I

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:29.886
KNOW ONE OF THE STUDY SHOWS THAT

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:31.087
THOUGH THE ONE IS REFERRED TO IN

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:32.822
THE REPORT IN THE ANALYSIS --

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:35.425
ACTUALLY ANNOUNCED BY THE STAFF

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:37.994
BY THE WAY -- THAT IN SEATTLE

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.195
THE LITTER SCHOOL TIMES.

01:01:39.262 --> 01:01:42.165
LED -- TO INCREASING PUNCTUALITY

01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:43.466
AND TEN IS A PERFECTLY AMOUNTS

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:44.634
ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.169
SCHOOLS I'M SO I DO THINK THAT

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:47.537
THERE'S A NUMBER OF X. FACTORS I

01:01:47.603 --> 01:01:49.272
THINK THAT MOVING IT.

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:50.373
YOUR DOCTOR GONNA HAVE SOME

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:50.973
PARENTS GONNA BECAUSE OF AN

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:51.707
ISSUE WITH SOME PARENTS MIGHT

01:01:51.774 --> 01:01:53.409
MAKE IT EASIER -- FOR BUT I DO

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:55.078
THINK THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT.

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:56.412
ONCE YOU'RE ACCUSTOMED TO A

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:57.113
CERTAIN SCHEDULE THAT YOURS YOUR

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.282
SCHEDULE GETS ADJUSTED SO

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:00.683
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT IT IT

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.085
WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE.

01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:05.788
SOME EFFORT OF FOR EVERYONE TO

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:06.923
TO HAVE TO READJUST AND I KNOW

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:07.356
THAT.

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:08.691
COSTS -- PARTICULARLY BECOMES

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:09.992
TRANSPORTATION IS SUCH ARE

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.627
SOMETHING THAT -- WE ALL HAVE TO

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:15.264
BE CONCERNED ABOUT -- SURE -- I

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:16.466
WOULD HAVE TO YOU KNOW THE

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:18.868
DECISION TO COME TO US -- AT

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:19.535
SOME POINT IF THERE'S A IF THERE

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:21.771
IS A REAL ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:23.072
COST AND TRANSPORTATION WITH

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:24.941
SOME OF THE DISTANCE I DO HAVE.

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:26.342
A MORE EXTENSIVE BUSING AND IN

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:30.246
PARTICULAR -- BUT BUT I I THINK

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:32.849
THAT -- THE BUT WITH ME IS A

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:35.284
SIGN IS THE SCIENCE AND AS THE

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:37.620
CHAIR INDICATED GOOD POLICY --

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:39.122
GOOD POLICY ISN'T ALWAYS EASY TO

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:40.756
IMPLEMENT AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:41.357
EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE EASY TO

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.658
IMPLEMENT.

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:43.493
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:47.330
DON'T PURSUE IT -- AND SO WITH

01:02:47.396 --> 01:03:01.010
THAT I'M I MAKE THEM OUT OF MY

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:04.247
COMMISSION WITH THE BILL

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:04.547
[inaudible]

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:05.815
ANYBODY ELSE.

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:07.316
SOME REMEMBER SPENT.

HIS DILIGENCE IN THIS EFFORT I

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:10.520

FOLKS IN THE ROOM.

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:19.395
THE EVIDENCE IS STARTING TO

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.864
BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPELLING.

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:23.933
AND WE ARE OBLIGATED AS A STATE

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.735

01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:28.070
CRISIS TO START LOOKING AT HOW

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:29.772
WE STOP THIS WITH OUR YOUTH.

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:31.541
AND I CANNOT CONTINUE TO TALK TO

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:32.875

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:38.147
BUT IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:39.682
WE CAN DO LIKE THIS THAT WE CAN

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:41.117
FIGURE OUT THE LOGISTICS OF THAT

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:43.386
WE CAN FUND OF THE LOGISTICS OF

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:44.921
TO HELP GIVE OUR STUDENTS ONE

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.422

SOMETIMES WE COMPILE IT BY AN

01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:04.207
OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE

01:04:04.273 --> 01:04:05.441

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:14.350
WEBER YES I I DO WANT TO THANK

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:15.818
THE AUTHOR -- HE'S BEEN VERY

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:18.120
PERSISTENT AND WITH REGARDS TO

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:19.989
THIS BILL AND AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:21.524
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO HIM.

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:24.093
AN IMPORTANT TO TO ALL OF US WHO

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.562
I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT KIDS -- YOU

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:27.797
KNOW MY MY CONTACT WITH THIS IF

01:04:27.863 --> 01:04:29.232
INFORMATION GOES WAY BACK TO

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:30.166
WHEN I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:31.601
WHICH IS SOME TWENTY SOME ODD

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.936
YEARS AGO -- WHERE THE RESEARCH

01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:35.504
BEGAN AND AND PEOPLE BEGIN TO

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:38.374
TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR CHANGE

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:39.976
AND IT'S NOT AN EASY THING I

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:41.377
THINK THE THE MOST DIFFICULT

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:42.511
TIME EVER HAD ON SCHOOL BOY WAS

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:43.846
SIMPLY CHANGING TIMES?

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:46.382
WHEN SCHOOL STARTS AND STOPS?

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:47.316
FOUR HOURS WAS FOR BUSING

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:49.352
REASONS MUCH MORE THAN ACADEMIC

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:51.020
REASONS AND IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:52.755
IT'S GOING TO CREATE THE END OF

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:54.590
THE WORLD FOR PEOPLE TO CHANGE

01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:56.058
FROM TWENTY MINUTES TO THIRTY

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:56.325
MINUTES.

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:58.694
WHATEVER IT MAY BE AND AND YET

01:04:58.761 --> 01:05:00.096
AND YOU TAKE THAT HARD DECISION

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:01.697
YOU MAKE WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO AND

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:03.666
AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THEN

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.501
PEOPLE GO ON WITH THEIR LIVES.

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:06.469
THEY MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT THEY

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:08.404
MOVE ON A EVEN FORGET WHAT THAT

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:09.238
THE STARTING TIME USED TO BE

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:10.206
BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE ON A

01:05:10.273 --> 01:05:12.275
DIFFERENT TIME AND AFTER.

01:05:12.341 --> 01:05:13.409
WE ADJUST THEIR LIVES TO MAKE IT

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:15.778
HAPPEN -- THIS IS REALLY ABOUT

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:17.046
BUT I THINK THAT THE THE MOST

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:18.347
IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS IS

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:19.915
THAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT WHAT

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:21.984
IS GOOD FOR KIDS.

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:24.287
AND WHAT THE HELPS THEM -- TO

01:05:24.353 --> 01:05:25.755
BASICALLY IT JUST WELL AND TO DO

01:05:25.821 --> 01:05:28.024
WELL IN SCHOOL AND WE SHOULD BE

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.158
SEEKING EVERY.

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:31.727
METHOD THAT WE CAN FIND TO MAKE

01:05:31.794 --> 01:05:33.362
THE WORLD BETTER FOR OUR KIDS.

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:35.931
WE SEEM TO BE IN AN AVALANCHE OF

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:37.933
PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF THE KIDS

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.569
HAVING ISSUES AND DEPRESSION AND

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:42.138
SUICIDE.

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:43.572
ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE JUST

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:46.042
FEEL OVERWHELMED BY AT AND AND

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:47.677
WELL THIS IS NOT A SILVER BULLET

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:49.345
IT HAS SOME EVIDENCE THAT SAYS

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:50.746
THIS CAN BE DONE.

01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:51.781
AND IT CAN BE DONE TO THE

01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:53.049
BENEFIT OF OUR CHILDREN.

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:54.950
AND I KNOW EVERY DISTRICT WANTS

01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:56.686
TO DECIDE IT'S ONLY ISSUES.

01:05:56.752 --> 01:05:57.753
I'VE HAD A LOT OF THESE

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.422
DISTRICTS WHO ASKED ME THAT WE

01:05:59.488 --> 01:06:01.190
DO THIS SO THEY THEY DON'T HAVE

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:03.125
TO FIGHT THE BATTLE AT THE LOCAL

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:04.060
LEVEL AND DEAL WITH ALL THE

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:05.728
PARENTS TO COME IN THE SCREAMING

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:06.295
AND THE HOLLERING AND THEN

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:12.635
THEY'RE SUBJECT TO ELECTION AND

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:12.935
THEY DON'T.

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:15.838
KNOW OVERWHELMED BY IT -- BUT

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:16.739
YOU KNOW I'VE LISTEN TO THIS THE

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:17.340
STORIES FOR A VERY LONG TIME

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:18.374
ABOUT WHY WE SHOULDN'T DO IT AND

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:18.908
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT.

01:06:18.974 --> 01:06:19.408
THAT YOU GIVE PEOPLE AN

01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:20.176
OPPORTUNITY TO BE IN CHARGE OF

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:20.976
AND TO TAKE AND AND WHAT WE

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:22.845
BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL OF THE

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:25.214
REALITY IS WE DO A LOT OF THINGS

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:26.482
THAT ARE NOT LOCAL CONTROL AND

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:27.683
WITH ITS TERMS OF CURRICULUM AND

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:28.918
ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

01:06:28.984 --> 01:06:29.485
WE REALIZE.

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:31.087
HAVE TO BE DONE AT THIS LEVEL

01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:31.721
THAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:34.890
OUR KIDS SO THIS IS A DIFFICULT.

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:37.226
DECISION -- BUT IT'S ONE THAT I

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:38.894
THINK IS IS WORTH DOING.

01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:40.229
AND EVEN ONE OF OUR MEMBERS

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:41.931
TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME WAS ON

01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:43.399
THE FLOOR AND THIS IS PROBABLY

01:06:43.466 --> 01:06:45.167
THE CHEAPEST THING WE CAN DO TO

01:06:45.234 --> 01:06:46.802
IMPROVE THE LIVES OF OUR KIDS.

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:48.170
EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW IT'S GOING

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:49.271
TO TAKE MONEY FOR BUSING IN

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:50.906
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BUT WHEN

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:52.508
YOU LOOK AT THE OUTCOME IT'S

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:53.876
WORTH WHATEVER THE EXPENSES THAT

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:55.378
WE SAVE ONE LIFE.

01:06:55.444 --> 01:06:56.746
IT IS TRULY WORTH IT IF WE CAN

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:58.781
TRANSFORM MANY OF THE SCHOOLS TO

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.851
HIGHER PERFORMING SCHOOLS -- IT

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:02.852
IS TRULY WORTH IT BECAUSE WE

01:07:02.918 --> 01:07:04.153
HAVE TRIED SO MUCH AND WE HAVE

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.721
PUT SO MUCH MONEY INTO SO MANY

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:08.057
OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE NOT

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:08.491
WORKED.

01:07:08.557 --> 01:07:10.793
AND AND IT BRINGS WEEK MAKES ME

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.795
QUITE SAD YOU KNOW I WAS AT A

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:13.896
SCHOOL.

MEET FOR MY GRANDKIDS.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:18.834
WHEN I JUST HAPPEN TO LOOK AT

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:19.969
THE DATA FOR THE SCHOOL BECAUSE

01:07:20.035 --> 01:07:21.804
I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL NEED TO

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.339
FIND WHERE IT WAS AND?

01:07:23.406 --> 01:07:26.275
AND WAS IN A COMMUNITY -- AND IT

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:27.309
MACAM COMMUNIS MAJORITY WHITE

WAS I WAS REALLY QUITE UPSET

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:31.947
WHEN I GOT THERE TO THIS AND AND

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:34.417
I LOOK AT THE DATA THAT OVER

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:35.017
HALF OF THE KIDS DROP OUT OF

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:35.751
SCHOOL.

01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:38.354
OVER HALF OF THE KIDS IN THIS

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:40.189
DISTRICT DROP OUT OF SCHOOL.

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:40.990
AND THEY'RE IN THE 30% OFF AND

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:41.991
ON AND ON AND ON AND WENT ON AND

01:07:42.057 --> 01:07:44.727
ON AND AND I WAS JUST LIKE MY

GOODNESS WHAT IS GOING ON HERE

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:47.630
WHY ISN'T THERE.

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:48.798
A BILL BEING WRONG WHY ISN'T

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:50.199
THERE SOME ALARM OCCURRING.

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:52.401
AND AND I KNOW THAT IN THIS ONE

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:54.336
COMMUNITY THERE'S A LOT OF

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:55.905
DRINKING THERE'S A LOT OF OF CAR

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:57.973
ACCIDENTS THAT HAPPEN IS A LOT

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.008
OF TRAUMA AND STRESS.

01:07:59.074 --> 01:08:00.676
AND IN THE END ONE OF THE EAST

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.077
COUNTY SCHOOLS IN SENEGAL COUNTY

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:03.746
AND IT'S NOT IN MY DISTRICT BUT

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:04.647
I JUST HAPPEN TO LOOK AT THE

01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:06.615
DATA OF WHAT I SAW AND I SAW A

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:07.783
LOT OF TRAGEDY.

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:09.251
AND A LOT OF PAIN IN THIS

01:08:09.318 --> 01:08:11.220
DISTRICT JUST LOOKING AT THE

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:13.355
INFORMATION OF AND I THOUGHT TO

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:15.458
MYSELF AND I'VE GOT TO TALK TO

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:17.493
MY COLLEAGUE WHO'S THAT THE

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.094
SCHOOLS A MEMBER THERE.

01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:20.029
WHY HAVEN'T YOU SET A SET THE

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.430
ALARM WHY HAVEN'T YOU RAISE THIS

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:22.431
ISSUE I MEAN IT'S INCOME IT IS

01:08:22.498 --> 01:08:23.399
UNACCEPTABLE IN THIS IN THIS DAY

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:25.701
AND AGE TO HAVE OVER 50% OF YOUR

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:26.735
KIDS NOT GRADUATED FROM HIGH

01:08:26.802 --> 01:08:27.203
SCHOOL?

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:29.205
AND AND SO I THINK THERE'S JUST

01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:30.272
SO MANY THINGS GOING ON IN SO

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:32.041
MUCH PAIN IS SO MUCH DIFFICULTY

01:08:32.107 --> 01:08:34.109
IN FAMILIES AND ALL KINDS OF

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:34.743
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO A LITTLE

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.245
BIT OF SOMETHING. TO MAKE IT A

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:38.214
LITTLE BIT BETTER -- AND THIS IS

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.882
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE --

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:42.017
SAN DIEGO UNIFIED IS IS WORKING

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:42.852
ON BASICALLY DOING THEIR

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:44.720
DISTRICT AND IN THIS WAY BECAUSE

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.455
THEY REALIZE THAT WE'VE GOT TO

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:47.423
DO A BETTER JOB.

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:51.961
IT WILL BE TO BEEN DOING AND IF

01:08:52.027 --> 01:08:53.229
THIS CAN HELP.

01:08:53.295 --> 01:08:55.030
ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM SOLVE SOME

01:08:55.097 --> 01:08:55.998
OF IT WE CAN'T SO I WANNA THANK

01:08:56.065 --> 01:08:57.166
THE AUTHOR FOR COMING TODAY.

01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:59.401
I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS AGAIN

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:00.536
BECAUSE I'VE COME UP LIKE I SAID

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:01.170
I'VE KNOWN THIS FOR OVER TWENTY

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:01.837
SOME ODD YEARS AND HAVE NOT BEEN

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:02.471
ABLE TO MOVE DISTRICTS IN THAT

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:03.939
DIRECTION -- BUT I THINK AT THE

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:05.441
STATE LEVEL IF WE CAN PROVIDE

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:06.942
THE DIRECTION IN THE SUPPORT

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:08.177
THAT'S NECESSARY THAT MAKES THE

01:09:08.244 --> 01:09:09.712
TRANSFORMATION EASIER FOR

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:11.447
DISTRICTS WE HAVE TO DO THAT FOR

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:14.283
OUR KIDS OF NOTHING ELSE THANK

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.285
YOU SO MUCH.

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:17.219
THANK YOU A SINGLE OF MR KILEY

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:19.021
I'M SORRY.

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:20.589
THIS IS THAT I BELIEVE THE THIRD

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:22.391
TIME THIS BILLS COME BEFORE THIS

01:09:22.458 --> 01:09:24.627
COMMITTEE -- AND ALTHOUGH SHE

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:25.594
SAID IT'S NOT THE SAME BILL --

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:27.796
IT -- THIS TIME AROUND -- EXAMS

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:29.598
RURAL DISTRICTS.

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.734
IT -- STAGGER START TIMES FOR

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.168
MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS

01:09:33.235 --> 01:09:34.403
WHICH IT DIDN'T DO BEFORE.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:35.871
THE PROVIDES GREATER FLEXIBILITY

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:37.306
IN THE PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:38.674
BILL ALTHOUGH IN MY VIEW STILL

01:09:38.741 --> 01:09:40.342
NOT ENOUGH STILL NOT THE

01:09:40.409 --> 01:09:41.510
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:43.546
AND STILL HAS SOME WAY TO GO IN

01:09:43.612 --> 01:09:45.981
THAT RESPECT -- WHEN I'VE BEEN

01:09:46.048 --> 01:09:47.683
WHEN I FAILED TO VOTE FOR THIS

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:48.551
BILL IN THE PAST?

01:09:48.617 --> 01:09:49.652
IT'S BEEN.

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:52.488
A DIFFICULT DECISION BECAUSE THE

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:54.223
EVIDENCE I THINK IS QUITE

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:55.791
POWERFUL I THINK THAT THE WEIGHT

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:57.026
OF THE EVIDENCE ALTHOUGH

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:58.460
APPARENTLY THERE ARE SOME.

01:09:58.527 --> 01:09:59.562
CONFLICTING STUDIES BUT THE

01:09:59.628 --> 01:10:02.097
WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS

01:10:02.164 --> 01:10:03.899
THERE ARE BENEFITS ALONG.

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:05.601
SEVERAL DIMENSIONS -- TO OUR

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:08.137
KIDS WHEN WE START SCHOOL LATER

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:10.539
AND OUT FROM REDUCE TRAFFIC

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:11.807
ACCIDENTS.

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:12.908
TO GRAB INCREASE GRADUATION

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:14.143
RATES TO IMPROVED ACADEMIC

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:16.512
PERFORMANCE -- AND TO WHAT

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:17.980
REALLY STRUCK ME WAS THAT MENTAL

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.382
HEALTH CONSEQUENCES THIS IS BEEN

01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:21.116
A FOCUS OF OUR COMMITTEE WE

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:22.952
CONVENE AND ADD A INFORMATIONAL

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:24.253
HEARING EARLIER THIS YEAR.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.321
REALLY FOCUSED ON THE VERY

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:26.855
SERIOUS ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:28.324
IN OUR SCHOOLS THE CHAIR AND I

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.025
HAVE JOINTLY AUTHORED BILLS TO

01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:32.294
TRY TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH IN

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:33.429
OUR SCHOOLS AND THERE'S STILL A

01:10:33.495 --> 01:10:34.196
LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT THE

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:34.863
EVIDENCE.

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:36.799
HERE IS VERY POWERFUL WHEN IT

01:10:36.865 --> 01:10:38.367
COMES TO THE IMPACT ON YOUTH

01:10:38.434 --> 01:10:40.069
MENTAL HEALTH OVER SIXTY STUDIES

01:10:40.135 --> 01:10:42.271
LINK SLEEP LOSS WITH SUICIDES

01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:44.273
TEENAGER THE MOST SLEEP DEPRIVED

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:45.007
AGE GROUP THEY'RE DEVELOPING

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:45.407
BRAINS.

01:10:45.474 --> 01:10:46.241
ARE ALSO THE MOST VULNERABLE TO

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:47.776
SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND THE RISK

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:49.511
OF SUICIDE DECREASES BY ELEVEN

01:10:49.578 --> 01:10:50.245
AT PERCENT.

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:55.751
WITH EACH ADDITIONAL HOUR OF

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:57.820
SLEEP.

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:58.754
SO WHAT HELD ME BACK FROM

01:10:58.821 --> 01:10:59.388
SUPPORTING THE BILL IN THE PAST

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:00.489
IS THIS IDEA OF LOCAL CONTROL.

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:03.025
AT THESE DECISIONS ARE BEST MADE

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:03.659
BY IN AT THE LEVEL WHERE IT IS

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:05.728
CLOSEST TO THE FAMILIES THAT ARE

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:06.228
AFFECTED.

01:11:06.295 --> 01:11:08.530
AND AND LOCAL CONTROL ALLOWS FOR

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:10.265
DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO BE TRIED

01:11:10.332 --> 01:11:11.500
AND SUCCESS TO BE REPLICATED THE

01:11:11.567 --> 01:11:12.835
TRUTH IS WE DON'T.

01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:15.004
ALLOW FOR NEARLY ENOUGH LOCAL

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:16.705
CONTROL IN THE STATE.

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:17.873
WE HAVE -- THIS FIRM IS INVOKED

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:18.941
SO SELECTIVELY.

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:20.709
OUR EDUCATION CODE IS WAY

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:22.011
THICKER THAN IT SHOULD BE

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:23.145
COMPARED TO OTHER STATE IS ONE

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:24.713
OF THE REASONS OUR EDUCATIONAL

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:25.914
OUTCOMES.

01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:27.349
LACK.

01:11:27.416 --> 01:11:29.985
AND IT'S TRUE THAT I'VE HAD OVER

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:31.520
THE COURSE OF THAT. THREE TIMES

01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:33.422
I CONSIDER THIS BILL MANY SCHOOL

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:34.790
LEADERS DISTRICT LEADERS SCHOOL

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:36.625
WHERE MEMBERS REACH OUT AND SAY

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:37.726
THIS IS A MATTER FOR OUR

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:40.062
DISTRICT TO THE SIDE -- AFTER

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:40.562
RECEIVING INPUT FROM OUR

01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:41.630
COMMUNITY.

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:43.399
BUT LIKE DOCTOR WEBER I'VE ALSO

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:44.033
HEARD.

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:45.734
FROM SCHOOL LEADERS AND DISTRICT

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:46.468
LEADERS.

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:47.870
WHO SAY THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:49.204
MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION BUT THERE

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:50.506
ARE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS TO DOING

01:11:50.572 --> 01:11:53.342
SO -- THE SUPERINTENDENT OF ONE

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:54.510
OF THE DISTRICTS IN THE AREA I

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:57.046
REPRESENT -- MADE THE POINT THAT

01:11:57.112 --> 01:11:58.947
IF THEY'RE JUST RECORDED CHANGED

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.582
AND THEY'D BE OUT OF SYNC WITH

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:02.818
THE NEIGHBORING SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:04.186
WHICH WOULD PRESENT A LOT OF

01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:05.387
CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF ENTRY

01:12:05.454 --> 01:12:06.989
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES.

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:07.823
AND OTHER THINGS AND THERE'S

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:08.991
EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:10.526
THIS IDEAS WELL THERE'S AN

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:11.827
ARTICLE HERE FROM THE JOURNAL OF

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:13.495
EDUCATION -- AND HEALTH WOOD

01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:14.897
SAYS THE BECAUSE OF LOCAL WISE

01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:16.699
CONTROL NEIGHBORING SCHOOLS ARE

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:18.300
NOT ANSWERABLE TO EACH OTHER AND

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:20.436
REGIONAL ATTEMPTS AT CHANGE CAN

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:21.804
BE THWARTED BY ONE SCHOOL BOARD.

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:23.205
LOCAL CONTROL HAS BECOME IN THIS

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:24.707
INSTANCE THE REASON THAT SCHOOL

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:26.275
LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS HAVE LIMITED

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:27.876
CONTROL OVER THEIR ABILITY TO

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:29.278
ACT ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF

01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:30.813
THE NATION'S PEDIATRICIANS.

01:12:30.879 --> 01:12:34.016
LOCAL CONTROL BECOMES LOCAL LACK

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:34.450
OF CONTROL.

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:35.651
THIS PARADOX AND OF COURSE THE

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:37.019
OVERWHELMING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:38.454
IS WHY MANY EXPERTS ARE CALLING

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.355
FOR THE STATE'S TO STEP IN THE

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:42.357
STATE HEALTHY BOUNDARIES. FOR

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:44.059
SCHOOL START TIMES.

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:44.493
SO.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.828
BECAUSE OF THIS COLLECTIVE

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:47.229
ACTION PROBLEM I THINK THE LOCAL

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:48.497
CONTROL ARGUMENT AT LEAST CUTS

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:49.798
BOTH WAYS.

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:51.533
AT THAT POINT I THINK IT'S ONLY

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.268
FAIR TO DEFER TO THE OVERALL IN

01:12:53.335 --> 01:12:54.603
WYOMING WEIGHT OF SCIENTIFIC

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:57.072
EVIDENCE AS FAR AS WHAT IS IN

01:12:57.139 --> 01:12:57.406
THE INTEREST.

01:12:57.473 --> 01:13:00.175
OF OUR KIDS -- NOW THAT BEING

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:02.144
SAID I AS I SAID BEFORE I STILL

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:03.312
DON'T THINK THERE IS ENOUGH

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:04.580
FLEXIBILITY.

01:13:04.646 --> 01:13:05.547
IN THE BILL SO I JUST WANT TO

01:13:05.614 --> 01:13:07.349
ASK THE AUTHOR I WOULD YOU

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:09.251
COMMIT AND FOR WHAT IT IS ONE

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:10.285
EXAMPLE WITH DISTRICTS THAT HAVE

01:13:10.352 --> 01:13:12.387
A ULTIPLE CONFIGURATIONS OF

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:13.188
RATE LEVELS.

01:13:13.255 --> 01:13:14.089
THIS CAN PRESENT UNIQUE

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:15.290
CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:17.126
TRANSPORTATION OTHER THINGS SO I

01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:17.726
WHAT WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:19.094
COMMIT TO WORKING TO ADDRESS

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:20.562
SOME OF THOSE ISSUES TO ARRIVE

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:21.463
AT THE RIGHT LEVEL OF

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:23.565
FLEXIBILITY BEFORE -- THIS BILL

01:13:23.632 --> 01:13:25.701
GOES INTO EFFECT SO FIRST OF ALL

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:27.202
OF THE THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:28.837
ANALYSIS -- THE COMMENT YOU MADE

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:30.506
ARE ARE VERY VERY HELPFUL

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:32.007
CONVERSATION AND I APPRECIATE

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:33.876
YOU'VE DELVING SO DEEP INTO IT.

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:35.110
BECAUSE YOU HAD THE HEART OF THE

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:36.678
AP HEADED OUT OF THE PARK.

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:38.847
THE REASON WHY THIS BILL HAS A

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:41.083
THREE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION CYCLE

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:42.417
I MEAN I RECOGNIZE THAT IF WE

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:44.686
SAID TODAY OR JANUARY ONE WHEN

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:45.921
THIS BE BECOME LAW.

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:49.158
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR BILL

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:49.591
SCHEDULE [inaudible]

01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:50.325
THAT FALL.

01:13:50.392 --> 01:13:51.860
WE KNOW THAT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:54.062
THE REASON WHY THIS BILL HAS A

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:55.764
THREE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION CYCLE.

01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:58.467
IS PRECISELY TO ADDRESS SOME OF

01:13:58.534 --> 01:14:00.536
THE CONCERNS YOU BROUGHT UP IS

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:01.870
TO WORK WITH THE DISTRICTS.

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:03.672
YOU KNOW THIS WILL FRANKLY FORCE

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.174
DISTRICTS THE PLAN FOR THE

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:10.813
CHANGE WHICH WILL IDENTIFY IT'S

01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:12.114
MY INTENT.

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:14.550
DURING THAT THREE YEARS I HAVE

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:16.552
FIVE AND A HALF YEARS LEFT HERE.

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:18.020
TO WORK WITH THE DISTRICTS IN

01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:20.622
CONCERT AND IN COLLABORATION TO

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:24.159
ADDRESS THOSE THINGS FOR EXAMPLE.

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:24.827
ONE LEGITIMATE ISSUE THAT'S COME

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:27.129
UP THERE'S A HANDFUL OF SCHOOLS

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:28.831
OUT THERE THAT DON'T HAVE LIGHTS.

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:30.632
ON THEIR SPORTS FIELDS THAT'S A

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:32.367
LEGITIMATE.

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:34.036
ISSUE YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO WORK

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:35.571
ON A FUNDING SOURCE TO TRY TO

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.272
HELP THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT

01:14:37.339 --> 01:14:38.407
DON'T HAVE LIGHTS DURING THAT SO

WERE WELL TAKEN -- TO THAT'S THE

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:47.950
WHOLE POINT.

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:50.052
WE HAVE THREE YEARS TO WORK ON

01:14:50.118 --> 01:14:52.387

01:14:52.454 --> 01:14:53.555
SAYING NO.

01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:54.456
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO HAVE

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:57.259
THAT SIT DOWN CONVERSATION.

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:59.528
THAT GIVES THAT THE ROBUST --

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:01.530
FOCUS WE NEED SO YES OBVIOUSLY

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:03.966
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:20.649
I I KNOW THAT.

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:21.917
WHEN THERE'S A CHANGE THIS

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:22.885
DRAMATIC?

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:25.754
YOU KNOW IT'S HARD -- YOU HAVE

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:27.456
EXPERTS IN THE CLASSROOM YOU

01:15:27.522 --> 01:15:28.924
HAVE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS WHO

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:33.228
HAVE STRUGGLE WITH THESE ISSUES --

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:34.696
THE COMMENTS YOU'VE ALL MADE OUR

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:36.899
OUR JERMAINE AND AND THE RIGHT

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:38.767
QUESTIONS TO ASK WHAT IS THE

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:40.802
IMPACT ON WORKING FAMILIES WELL.

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:42.437
THAT'S THE RIGHT QUESTION.

01:15:42.504 --> 01:15:44.039
THE DATA SHOWS THAT UNDER THE

01:15:44.106 --> 01:15:45.540
CURRENT SYSTEM THERE'S A SOCIAL

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:47.042
INEQUITY IN WORKING CHILDREN

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:48.043
WORKING FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS ARE

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:50.078
THE MOST DISADVANTAGED AND GET

01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:51.246
THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SLEEP.

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:52.581
UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHO

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:54.316
GETS THE BIGGEST BENEFIT AFTER

01:37:32.713 --> 01:37:34.682
EDUCATIONAL CATALYST.

01:37:34.748 --> 01:37:36.350

01:44:32.332 --> 01:44:34.267
DOCTOR WEBER WANTED TO COME

01:44:34.334 --> 01:44:36.436
RIGHT I WANT -- TO ARE CLEARLY

01:44:36.503 --> 01:44:38.238
THINK -- SENATE FOR FOR BRINGING

01:44:38.305 --> 01:44:39.306
THIS BILL FORWARD IN AND THIS IS

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:41.541
BEEN SOMETHING ON THE AGENDA FOR

01:44:41.608 --> 01:44:42.609
AT LEAST A LONG AS I'VE BEEN

01:44:42.676 --> 01:44:44.978
HERE -- AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE

01:44:45.045 --> 01:44:46.613
THAT WE HAVE TO AMENDED TO LEAVE

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:47.781
UP THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:49.316
BECAUSE THAT REALLY IS ONE OF

01:44:49.383 --> 01:44:50.450
THE MAJOR CHALLENGES THAT'S

01:44:50.517 --> 01:44:52.586
THERE THAN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:44:52.653 --> 01:44:54.354
ADDRESS THAT -- I GUESS IT WAS

01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:55.856
PROBABLY A COUPLE YEARS AGO I

01:44:55.922 --> 01:44:58.392
WAS ASKED INVITED TO GO TO

01:44:58.458 --> 01:44:59.726
WASHINGTON NEW YORK.

01:44:59.793 --> 01:45:00.927
TO PARTICIPATE IN A CONVERSATION

01:45:00.994 --> 01:45:05.999
CONCERNING SUSPENSIONS AND

01:45:06.066 --> 01:45:07.567
EXPULSIONS.

01:45:07.634 --> 01:45:08.735
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING

01:45:08.802 --> 01:45:09.336
I WAS INVITED SO I WENT AND I

01:45:09.403 --> 01:45:10.270
EXPECTED TO YOU KNOW TO LEARN A

01:45:10.337 --> 01:45:11.138
LOT FROM FOLKS ALL ACROSS THE

01:45:11.204 --> 01:45:11.772
COUNTRY IS THE WHAT THEY WERE

01:45:11.838 --> 01:45:12.839
DOING.

01:45:12.906 --> 01:45:14.708
AND A LOT OF THEM WITH THEIR BUT

01:45:14.775 --> 01:45:15.909
WHAT SHOCKED ME MOST WAS I GOT

01:45:15.976 --> 01:45:16.977
THE IN WHO WAS LEADING THE

01:45:17.044 --> 01:45:18.679
CONVERSATION AS A THOR HE'S IN

01:45:18.745 --> 01:45:19.680
THE ROOM WAS AT DEPARTMENT OF

01:45:19.746 --> 01:45:20.847
EDUCATION.

01:45:20.914 --> 01:45:23.016
IN CALIFORNIA -- AND THEY HAD

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:24.284
ALL THE RESEARCH AND ALL THE

01:45:24.351 --> 01:45:26.153
DATA IN ALL THE INFORMATION IT

01:45:26.219 --> 01:45:26.720
JUST KIND OF BLEW ME AWAY

01:45:26.787 --> 01:45:29.156
BECAUSE YOU I DON'T SEE THEM

01:45:29.222 --> 01:45:30.824
PRESENTING THAT DATE AND THAT

01:45:30.891 --> 01:45:32.125
INFORMATION AND DRIVING IF

01:45:32.192 --> 01:45:33.326
YOU'RE CALIFORNIA.

01:45:33.393 --> 01:45:35.562
AND SO I WAS KIND OF SHOCKED

01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:37.864
THAT THEY WERE THERE AND AND AND

01:45:37.931 --> 01:45:38.899
AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING

01:45:38.965 --> 01:45:40.767
THIS WORK AND AND WERE REALLY

01:45:40.834 --> 01:45:43.603
STRONG SUPPORT IS AGAINST US THE

01:45:43.670 --> 01:45:44.805
SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS.

01:45:44.871 --> 01:45:46.440
AND AND YOU KNOW THEY WERE

01:45:46.506 --> 01:45:49.142
INFORMING OTHER STATES ABOUT

01:45:49.209 --> 01:45:51.011
THIS ISSUE WHEN WE WOULD NOT

01:45:51.078 --> 01:45:53.313
LEADING IN PRACTICE SO I JUST

01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:54.748
FOUND IT EXTREMELY.

01:45:54.815 --> 01:45:56.817
INTERESTING FOR ME TO COME THERE

01:45:56.883 --> 01:45:59.019
AND REALIZING THAT I WAS WALKING

01:45:59.086 --> 01:46:01.588
IN TO BE ON THE TEAM OF EXPERTS --

01:46:01.655 --> 01:46:03.123
WHEN I THOUGHT I'D BE HEARING

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:04.758
FROM OUR OWN DEPARTMENT -- OR

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:06.093
HEARING FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS

01:46:06.159 --> 01:46:06.993
AND WE HEARD FROM SOME OF THEM

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:09.129
AS TO WHAT NEED TO MOVE FORWARD

01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:10.430
AND SO I EVEN TODAY I STILL

01:46:10.497 --> 01:46:12.199
DON'T SEE THEM HERE LEADING THE

01:46:12.265 --> 01:46:13.166
CHARGE.

01:46:13.233 --> 01:46:14.568
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE

01:46:14.634 --> 01:46:16.203
LOTS OF WORK ON A LOTS OF

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:18.171
RESEARCH ON AND I THINK IT'S

01:46:18.238 --> 01:46:20.607
SOMETHING THAT -- THAT WE NEED

01:46:20.674 --> 01:46:22.809
TO TAKE THE LEAD ON IT'S IT'S I

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:23.410
MEAN I DON'T WITH THIS WHEN I

01:46:23.477 --> 01:46:24.544
WAS IN SCHOOL WERE TWENTY SOME

01:46:24.611 --> 01:46:26.079
YEARS AGO ABOUT THE OVER

01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:28.148
SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS OF

01:46:28.215 --> 01:46:30.817
KIDS IN THE OUTCOMES AND AND ALL

01:46:30.884 --> 01:46:31.985
THOSE THINGS THAT WAS SO UNFAIR

01:46:32.052 --> 01:46:32.786
AND SOMEONE JUST.

01:46:32.853 --> 01:46:33.987
IN DEALING WITH THE CHILDREN OF

01:46:34.054 --> 01:46:35.122
THAT WOULD BEARD WHO WAS GETTING

01:46:35.188 --> 01:46:37.224
SUSPENDED AND EXPELLED AND EVEN

01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:38.759
WHEN WE WOULD ELIMINATED THEY'D

01:46:38.825 --> 01:46:39.493
BE THE KIDS SITTING IN THE

01:46:39.559 --> 01:46:40.694
HALLWAY RATHER THAN IN THE

01:46:40.761 --> 01:46:42.062
CLASSROOM FOR INSTRUCTION.

01:46:42.129 --> 01:46:43.563
SO WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB

01:46:43.630 --> 01:46:45.132
AND WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO I

01:46:45.198 --> 01:46:46.967
MEAN I WAS LISTENING TO ALL OF

01:46:47.033 --> 01:46:48.168
OUR EXPERTS TALK ABOUT AND I

01:46:48.235 --> 01:46:49.536
THOUGHT TO MYSELF.

01:46:49.603 --> 01:46:50.804
YOU KNOW IT ARE WE GIVING THIS

01:46:50.871 --> 01:46:52.472
INFORMATION FOR TRAINING IN OUR

01:46:52.539 --> 01:46:54.307
SCHOOLS AND ARE WE HELPING FOLKS

01:46:54.374 --> 01:46:56.176
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING

01:46:56.243 --> 01:46:56.777
AND HOW THEY'RE DOING AND IT

01:46:56.843 --> 01:46:58.211
JUST SEEMS. TO BE SUCH A

01:46:58.278 --> 01:47:00.113
TREMENDOUS DISCONNECT HERE IN

01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:01.748
THE STATE BETWEEN WHAT OUR

01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:06.820
DEPARTMENT WAS DOING THIS ABOUT

01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:08.655
FOUR YEARS A SO WHAT I'VE

01:47:08.722 --> 01:47:09.923
DEPARTMENT KNEW AND WAS DOING IN

01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.257
RECOMMENDING.

01:47:10.323 --> 01:47:10.891
AND YET WHAT WE WERE DOING IN

01:47:10.957 --> 01:47:11.691
TERMS OF PRACTICE IN THE STATE

FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT'S

01:47:13.527 --> 01:47:15.662
AN ONGOING CHALLENGE -- WE NEED

01:47:15.729 --> 01:47:16.263
TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE

01:47:16.329 --> 01:47:18.398
REALLY LOUD ALLOW THE RESEARCH

01:47:18.465 --> 01:47:19.399
IN THE WORK THAT WE DO WITH THE

01:47:19.466 --> 01:47:21.468
STATE DEPARTMENT. TO DRIVE THE

01:47:21.535 --> 01:47:23.270
ACTIVITIES IN THE SUPPORT FOR AT

01:47:23.336 --> 01:47:25.505
OUR SCHOOLS IN THIS AREA BECAUSE

01:47:25.572 --> 01:47:26.406
IT IS EIGHT EIGHT IMPORTANT

01:47:26.473 --> 01:47:29.009
ISSUE AND ALL THE DATA IS CLEAR

01:47:29.075 --> 01:47:29.609
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN KIDS WHEN

01:47:29.676 --> 01:47:31.878
THEY'RE SUSPENDED AND EXPELLED.

01:47:31.945 --> 01:47:33.413
EARLY IN LIFE PARTICULARLY --

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.815
WAS STILL SUSPENDING KIDS IN

01:47:34.881 --> 01:47:36.082
KINDERGARTEN AND ALL THAT STUFF

01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:36.983

01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:39.820
SENSE -- BUT I I I THANK YOU FOR

01:47:39.886 --> 01:47:41.254
YOUR WORK AND YOU EFFORTS AND I

01:47:41.321 --> 01:47:44.524
THINK WE HAVE TO JUST CONTINUE

01:47:44.591 --> 01:47:46.159
TO PUSH A LITTLE BIT HARDER.

01:47:46.226 --> 01:47:48.228
MOVE THE BILL.

01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:50.063
IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED.

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:50.664
AND I SAID ONE HIGHLIGHT THAT

01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:51.898
THE SUSPENSION RATE IS NOW PART

01:47:51.965 --> 01:47:53.567
OF THE DASHBOARD.

01:47:53.633 --> 01:47:55.202
YES REALLY YES TELLS A LOT RIGHT

01:47:55.268 --> 01:47:56.169
AND REALLY MAKES DISTRICTS PAY

01:47:56.236 --> 01:47:58.171
ATTENTION OR NOT JUST.

01:47:58.238 --> 01:47:59.773
FOR THE FINAL FOR ALL ALL

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:03.810
REASONS -- SO WITH THAT I SEE NO

01:48:03.877 --> 01:48:04.311
FOR THE COMING FROM THE

01:48:04.377 --> 01:48:05.612
COMMITTEE.

HAVE I OBVIOUSLY HAD THE STEP UP

01:48:12.552 --> 01:48:13.119
FOR ANOTHER QUICK MEETINGS DID

01:48:13.186 --> 01:48:13.987
GET A CHANCE TO HEAR SOME OF THE

01:48:14.054 --> 01:48:14.921
DIALOGUE BUT I CAN GUESS AS TO

01:48:14.988 --> 01:48:16.590
WHERE SOME OF IT WAS AND I

01:48:16.656 --> 01:48:18.458
CERTAINLY SUPPORT.

01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:22.295
ANY EFFORT -- FOR US TO REDUCE --

01:48:22.362 --> 01:48:23.697
THE USE OF WILL FOR DEFIANCE --

01:48:23.763 --> 01:48:26.800
IN A MANNER THAT IS EXCLUDING --

01:48:26.867 --> 01:48:28.201
STUDENTS FROM TO SPANISH CASES

01:48:28.268 --> 01:48:30.036
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHO THE TARGET

01:48:30.103 --> 01:48:32.072
IS OFTENTIMES TO DATE AT LEAST

01:48:32.138 --> 01:48:40.380
OF WILLFUL DEFIANCE AND AND I I

01:48:40.447 --> 01:48:42.582
OR FRANKLY.

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:44.818
I I SECOND OTHER COMMENTS A AS I

01:48:44.885 --> 01:48:46.052
WAS WALKING HEARING FROM DOCTOR

01:48:46.119 --> 01:48:47.354
WEBER -- ABOUT THE EXCLUSION OF

01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:48.955
THAT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL

01:48:49.022 --> 01:48:49.522
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:48:49.589 --> 01:48:50.824
REALLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING A MUCH

01:48:50.891 --> 01:48:51.424
OF THE DISPARITY THAT THERE'S

01:48:51.491 --> 01:48:52.959
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE

01:48:53.026 --> 01:48:54.761
OUR STUDENTS -- OF THAT BOARD

01:48:54.828 --> 01:48:57.764
EVER REASON -- A TEACHER MAY

01:48:57.831 --> 01:48:59.399
BELIEVE IS NOT ENGAGING IN A WAY

01:48:59.466 --> 01:49:00.901
THAT'S HELPFUL TO THEM.

01:49:00.967 --> 01:49:05.572
I THINK THAT -- HAVING.

01:49:05.639 --> 01:49:06.439
I I THINK THAT THERE'S AN

01:49:06.506 --> 01:49:07.841
OPPORTUNITY EVEN AS THIS BILL --

01:49:07.908 --> 01:49:10.543
GOES FORWARD TO BETTER DEFINE.

01:49:10.610 --> 01:49:12.212
BOTH OF WILL FOR THE FINANCES

01:49:12.279 --> 01:49:14.014
THE SUBJECT SUBJECTIVITY OF IT

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:17.050
THAT IS SUCH THE IS SO MUCH AN

01:49:17.117 --> 01:49:18.285
ISSUE WE HAVE OTHER.

01:49:18.351 --> 01:49:19.352
BILL'S GOING FORWARD IN THIS

01:49:19.419 --> 01:49:21.021
BODY REGARDING AN IMPLICIT BIAS

01:49:21.087 --> 01:49:22.122
FOR EXAMPLE A NUMBER OF

01:49:22.188 --> 01:49:23.490
DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES.

01:49:23.556 --> 01:49:25.158
AND THE EMPRESS OF BY IS THAT

01:49:25.225 --> 01:49:26.960
EXIST AMONGST ALL OF US AS PART

01:49:27.027 --> 01:49:29.562
OF THE OF THE DATA THAT OCCURS

01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:30.764
REGARDING WILLFUL DEFIANCE

01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:32.499
SUSPENSIONS EXPULSIONS WHAT HAVE

01:49:32.565 --> 01:49:33.700
YOU.

01:49:33.767 --> 01:49:35.869
THAT -- IS A DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:49:35.936 --> 01:49:38.838
AFFECTS -- PARTICULARLY -- THE

01:49:38.905 --> 01:49:39.906
YOUNG MEN OF COLOR BUT CERTAINLY

01:49:39.973 --> 01:49:42.509
YOUNG STUDENTS OF COLOR.

01:49:42.575 --> 01:49:45.512
AND THE SUSPENSION SHOULD BE

01:49:45.578 --> 01:49:46.579
MADE VERY CLEARLY IS AN OPTIONAL

01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:48.748
LAST RESORT -- WHEN ADDRESSING

01:49:48.815 --> 01:49:50.016
BOTH OF DEFIANCE RATHER RATHER

01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:52.118
THAN REMOVING IT I UNDERSTAND

01:49:52.185 --> 01:49:53.320
CERTAINLY THE THE CHAIR AND

01:49:53.386 --> 01:49:55.255
OTHERS CONCERNS OF HAVING ALL

01:49:55.322 --> 01:49:57.090
THE TOOLS AVAILABLE BECAUSE

01:49:57.157 --> 01:49:58.458
TEACHING IS NOT EASY?

01:49:58.525 --> 01:49:59.259
AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH

01:49:59.326 --> 01:50:00.527
THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:50:00.593 --> 01:50:03.129
TEACHERS TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY.

01:50:03.196 --> 01:50:04.564
TO TEACH ALL OTHER STUDENTS AND

01:50:04.631 --> 01:50:05.932
AND THAT THERE'S ISSUES WITH ANY

01:50:05.999 --> 01:50:06.900
GIVEN STUDENT THAT SHOULD BE

01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:09.336
ADDRESSED I THINK THAT WE SHOULD.

01:50:09.402 --> 01:50:10.704
BUT IT TO THAT POINT THERE

01:50:10.770 --> 01:50:11.404
SHOULD BE AS MANY TOOLS AS

01:50:11.471 --> 01:50:13.273
POSSIBLE RATHER THAN THE

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:15.275
SUSPENSION ROUTE -- PROVOKE OR

01:50:15.342 --> 01:50:17.277
SHORT OF THE SUSPENSION ROUTE

01:50:17.344 --> 01:50:18.945
AND SOME HOLE I HOPE THAT.

01:50:19.012 --> 01:50:20.981
AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND

01:50:21.047 --> 01:50:24.217
AS THIS ISSUE CONTINUES TO BE

01:50:24.284 --> 01:50:26.086
DEBATED -- IN THE IN THE YEARS

01:50:26.152 --> 01:50:28.488
AHEAD THAT WE HAVE A RECOGNITION

01:50:28.555 --> 01:50:30.223
THAT WE SHOULD USE ALL TO WHAT

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:31.758
THE THE ALL THE TOOLS AVAILABLE

01:50:31.825 --> 01:50:33.259
SHOULD BE USED TO LIFT UP OUR

01:50:33.326 --> 01:50:35.261
STUDENTS AND TO PROVIDE.

01:50:35.328 --> 01:50:36.262
CERTAINLY A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR

01:50:36.329 --> 01:50:37.697
EVERYONE BUT REALLY DAHLE AND
