FOCUS ON BUILDING WAS A FOCUS ON

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.424
ISSUES -- BUT THE PRINCIPLE

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.026

FEW YEARS AGO.

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:27.907
TO PRIMARILY DEAL WITH THE

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:30.176
AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WORKERS HAVE

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.044
TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS WHEN

THEY'VE BEEN RETALIATED AGAINST

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:34.547
FOR REPORTING ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.649
IT CAN EASILY TAKE UP TO TWO TO

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:37.650
THREE YEARS FOR ANYTHING TO

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.452

NO ONE ELSE REPORTS WHATEVER THE

00:03:55.268 --> 00:04:04.877
ILLEGAL ACTIVITY WAS AND SO.

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:10.383

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:16.122
IS THAT.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:17.757
THE BILL WAS SORT OF SILENT ON

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.492
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE LABOR

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:20.727
COMMISSIONER'S SECURES A FINAL

ORDER CITATION SO THE

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:24.864
IMPLICATION IS THAT THE LAWSUIT

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.466
WOULD BE NECESSARY AND THE WHOLE

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:27.800
POINT OF THE BILL WAS.

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:29.035
TO NOT DEAL WITH THE THREE YEAR

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:29.969

PROCESS WORK FASTER AND BETTER.

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.283
IT ALSO CLARIFIES THAT INFORMAL

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.119
HEARINGS AS OPPOSED TO FORMAL

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:47.720

COMMISSIONER CONDUCTING THE

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:05.071
HEARING RATHER THAN AN

ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE.

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:07.707

00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:19.272
PROTECTION.

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:20.740
SO THE CITATION WOULD LAY OUT

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.208
THE PENALTIES.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.210
AND THEN HE WOULD GIVE THE

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.212
EMPLOYER EITHER THE OPTION TO

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.214
COMPLY WITH THE CITATION.

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.782
OR TOO APPEALING IT HERE.

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:33.119
SO OKAY SO IF THEY IF THEY DO

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:34.921
NOT APPEAL THEY HAVE TO PAY

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:44.597
WITHIN THAT IN DAYS FIVE IF THEY

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:45.765
TO APPEAL.

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.333
THEN THAT PUSHES THE TIME FRAME

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.536
BACK. TO MAKE A PAYMENT ON THE

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:52.505
ON THE JUDGMENT.

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:53.272
WELL YEAH IT WOULD DEPEND IF

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:54.040
THERE WOULD THEN BE HEARING IT

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:54.640
WOULD BE A DUE PROCESS HEARING

00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:55.408
SO CONCEIVABLY EMPLOYER COULD

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:57.777
GET A CITATION AND THEN FILE IN.

00:07:57.844 --> 00:07:58.911
OUR QUEST FOR HEARING THEN THERE

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.112
WOULD BE HEARING IN THE OF THE

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:00.713
EMPLOYER COULD PREVAIL AT THE

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.480
HEARING.

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:03.216
HOW WHAT TIMEFRAME ARE WE

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:05.885
LOOKING AT -- IN TERMS OF WHAT

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:07.186
IN TERMS OF THE THE HEARING --

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:07.920
THEY HERE YEAH.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.189
LAKE COUNTY DECISION SO IF I'M

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:11.991
AN EMPLOYER YOU KNOW FOR SOME

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:13.492
FOLKS THE THE THEIR PHILOSOPHY

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:15.761
IS JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE.

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:18.998
SO I'M WONDERING WHAT TIME FRAME

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:20.700
ALONG WITH THAT EMPLOYERS.

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:22.768
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HOLD N

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.770
TO THE FUNDS UNTIL THEY HAD A

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:29.242
THE MOUSE SUB SUBSEQUENT TO A

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:31.077
HEARING AND A DECISION

00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:31.377
[inaudible]

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:32.578
I WOULD.

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:33.713
THE THE IDEA BEHIND.

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:35.081
THE THE ORIGINAL BILL IS THE

00:08:35.147 --> 00:08:36.215
SPEED THAT UP SO FOR EXAMPLE IF

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:37.049
I MIGHT GIVE AN EXAMPLE AND I

00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:38.317
THINK IT'S FAIRLY AT ELEVEN OF

00:08:38.384 --> 00:08:39.352
THE OF THE ISSUE -- THE LET'S

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:40.653
SAY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER COMES

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.054
TO WORKPLACE AND DOES AN

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:44.090
INSPECTION AND TALKS. TO THREE

00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:45.625
OR FOUR WORKERS LET'S SAY AND

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:47.393
THEN LATER THAT AFTERNOON THOSE

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.961
THREE OR FOUR WORKERS ARE

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:52.064
TERMINATED.

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:53.232
BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER.

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:53.566
THEN.

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:54.667
STILL NEEDS TO DO AN

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:56.435
INVESTIGATION UNDER THE LAW BUT

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:57.870
CONCEIVABLY THE INVESTIGATION

00:08:57.937 --> 00:08:59.138
PROBABLY WOULDN'T TAKE VERY LONG

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.806
IN SUCH A CASE RIGHT SOME

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.775
RETALIATION CASES ARE ARE MUCH

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:04.343
MORE COMPLEX.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.578
AND THAT'S WHY WE PRESERVE THE

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:07.446
OLD PROCESS WHEREBY WE FILE A

00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:08.514
LAWSUIT.

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.917
THIS THIS PROVISION ENVISIONS

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:12.451
THE THESE MORE SORT OF

00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:13.886
STREAMLINED CASES I WOULD

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:15.621
IMAGINE AN INVESTIGATION LIKE

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:17.356
THAT COULD TAKE A MATTER OF DAYS.

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:18.658
IN WHICH CASE A CITATION WOULD

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:20.793
ISSUE THAN IT WOULD BE TEN DAYS

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.596
IN WHICH TO TO APPEAR.

00:09:23.663 --> 00:09:24.697
YEAH AND THEN I THINK THERE ARE

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:26.299
PROVISIONS IN THE LAW AND AT

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:27.466
THAT PROVIDE THAT HEARING HAS TO

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:28.868
BE HELD WITHIN SIXTY OR NINETY

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:29.735
DAYS.

00:09:29.802 --> 00:09:32.338
SO THAT WOULD BE -- WE KNOW THAT

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:33.606
THE THE TIME FRAME WOULD

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:36.008
ENVISION HOPEFULLY LESS.

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:37.343
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THERE'S A

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.946
PROVISION WHEREBY IF AN EMPLOYER --

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:42.014
DOESN'T PROVIDE THAT PREVAIL AT

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:43.382
THE HEARING THEY CAN FILE A WRIT.

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:45.451
IN COURT BUT RATE HEARINGS ALSO

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:47.720
TEND TO GO MUCH MORE QUICKLY

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:49.855
THAN SAY A LAWSUIT IS FILED A

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.724
CIVIL COMPLAINT WHICH IS WHAT WE

00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:55.161
DO NOW AND AFTERWARDS THE BOND.

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:58.297
AND THEY HAVE THE POST OFFICE.

00:09:58.364 --> 00:09:59.598
ONE OF THE MOST BOND TOO SURE

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:00.766
PAYMENT THAT'S RIGHT.

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:04.537
SO IF I'M AN EMPLOYEE AND I I'VE

00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:06.005
BEEN FIRED.

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:07.506
ALIENATION.

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:08.107
I'M JUST WONDERING HOW LONGER.

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:09.408
DID THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOME

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:09.809
KIND OF DECISION.

00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:11.911
BECAUSE FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:14.580
NEED THAT PAYCHECK.

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:15.548
DECISION ANYWAY IMPACT.

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:16.916
WELL THE LEGISLATION WE DID LAST

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.651
TIME DRAMATICALLY STREAMLINE

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:20.786
THAT PROCESS AND I THINK EVEN

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:22.288
THE SIXTY OR NINETY DAYS OF THE

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:23.856
APPEAL PROCESS IS BAD WHAT I

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:25.157
WANTED TO DO WE WERE EXAMINING

00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:26.625
THIS WE DIDN'T GET THAT FAR.

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:28.160
BUT ULTIMATELY AT THE LABOR

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:29.895
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE DOUBLE

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:31.197
WINDOW WHERE LITERALLY YOU GET

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:33.265
PAID RIGHTTHERE ON THE ON THE

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:34.233
JUDGMENT.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.035
IN IN USE INTERMEDIO BONDING

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:36.969
AGENCY.

00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:38.704
INSURANCE COMPANY AND THEN THEY

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:40.272
GO OUT AND COLLECT THE MONEY AND

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:42.041
SPLIT THE BURDEN OF PROOF RIGHT

00:10:42.108 --> 00:10:43.442
SO THAT GETTING TO YOUR POINT

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:44.710
THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:46.345
HERE WHEN SOMEBODY'S NOT PAID TO

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:47.813
THIS WASTE AFTER SOME OTHER

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.315
ISSUE OF RETALIATION.

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:51.083
THE THEY NEED TO PAY THE RENT

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.119
PAY FOR THE EXPENSES FIVE SO THE

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:55.221
KEY IS SPEED TO GET TO A PAGE TO

00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:58.391
CHECK NOT A RIGHT NOT A A LEAN

00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:00.059
AGAINST THE BUILDING NOT.

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:02.561
NOT A A A A LIABILITY AGAINST

00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:03.496
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS BUTA

00:11:03.562 --> 00:11:05.331
CHECK AND THEN FLIPPED THE

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:06.132
BURDEN AND CREDIT YOU MADE A

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:07.333
LITTLE MAKE A PROFIT TO GO

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.868
COLLECT THE MONEY.

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:10.169
RIGHT SO WEIRD BUSH WAS STILL

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:11.537
THAT'S STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:13.506
BUT EACH ONE OF THESE KIND OF

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:14.707
MAKES THE PROCESS FASTER AND

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:16.042
BETTER PARTICULARLY IN THE DEEP

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:17.543
OKAY IN THE CASES WHERE.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.211

00:14:20.826 --> 00:14:26.932
OF THIS IS -- SB.

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:27.766
ONE SEVENTY ONE FLIGHTS A BILL

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:29.134
THAT CAME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:32.037
LAST YEAR IT IS A BILL TO FIGHT

00:14:32.104 --> 00:14:33.772
PAY DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA.

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:36.242
WITH INFORMATION BECAUSE WHEN IT

00:14:36.308 --> 00:14:38.043
COMES TO PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.845
AND PEOPLE OF COLOR.

00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:41.213
YOU CAN'T FIX WHAT YOU DON'T

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.448
KNOW.

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:44.049
EQUAL PAY IS AN ISSUE I HAVE

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:46.785
BEEN WORKING ON FOR MANY MANY

00:14:46.852 --> 00:14:48.887
FIVE HATE TO SAY DECADES -- AND

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:50.155
OF COURSE -- WE HAVE MADE SOME

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:51.423
PROGRESS.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.726
IN THAT REGARD AND YET THEY'RE

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:55.594
STILL ARE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:58.163
ASSOCIATED WITH ON EQUAL PAY.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.231
AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE ON

00:14:59.298 --> 00:15:01.100
EQUAL PAY IS OFTEN HIDDEN FROM

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:01.767
SIGHT.

00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:04.303
NOT TRUST THE TWO EMPLOYEES BUT

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.272
OFTEN TO EMPLOYERS -- WHILE PAY

00:15:06.338 --> 00:15:08.140
INEQUITY CONTINUES MOST

00:15:08.207 --> 00:15:09.775
EMPLOYERS I BELIEVE DO NOT

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:12.111
INTEND TO DELIBERATELY

00:15:12.177 --> 00:15:13.545
SHORTCHANGE THEIR EMPLOYEES.

00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:14.980
I CAN'T THINK OF TOO MANY

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:16.649
EMPLOYERS I COULD ENVISION

00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:17.950
WAKING UP IN THE MORNING SAYING

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:20.586
OH GOODY HOW CAN I MAKE SURE

00:15:20.653 --> 00:15:20.786
THAT.

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:22.721
I'M NOT PAYING WOMEN EQUALLY TO

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:24.723
MEN I JUST THINK THAT THERE ARE

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.026
IMPLICIT SITUATIONS THAT EXIST.

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:29.662
AND THAT THIS IS A MEASURE THAT

00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:31.897
WILL TRY TO PUT A MIRROR -- TO

00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:33.666
IMPLORE YOUR PRACTICES SO THAT

00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:36.435
WE CAN -- RESOLVING CORRECT

00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:38.771
THESE DISPARITIES. TO THE EXTENT

00:15:38.837 --> 00:15:40.439
POSSIBLE SO.

00:15:40.506 --> 00:15:42.207
RECOGNIZING PAY DISCRIMINATION

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:44.443
IS HARD TO DETECT IN A DRESS THE

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.446
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED.

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:49.782
DURING ITS TERM A PROPOSED

00:15:49.848 --> 00:15:51.650
REVISION TO THE DEMOCRATIC

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:53.652
REPORT THAT LARGE EMPLOYERS

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:54.687
LARGE EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN

00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:56.922
SUBMITTING FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:58.624
SO THIS ISN'T REALLY KNEW WHAT

00:15:58.691 --> 00:15:59.992
WE'RE DOING IS TRYING.

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:01.060
TO EXPAND THE EMPLOYER

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:04.229
INFORMATION REPORT THE E. O. ONE

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.031

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.466
REPORTING OF PAY DATA.

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.868
BY RACE AND BY GENDER --

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:13.072
BEGINNING IN.

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:13.639
TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT WAS THE

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:15.474
NATURE OF THE BILL OF PROVIDE

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:17.609
THAT ADMINISTRATION AGAIN BUT IN

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:19.511
AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE

00:16:19.578 --> 00:16:20.913
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PUT A HALT

00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:22.481
TO THIS NEW RULE.

00:16:22.548 --> 00:16:24.283
DETAILING I SHOULD SAY TO

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.152
DEALING A SIGNIFICANT BLOW TO

00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:28.354
THE EFFORT TO FIND AND TO

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.722
ACHIEVE EQUAL PAY.

00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:31.590
NOW THE BREAKING NEWS IS THE

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:33.225
TRUST THIS PAST MONTH JUST A

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:35.861
COUPLE WEEKS AGO A FEDERAL JUDGE.

00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:38.063
ORDERED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.099
TO REINSTATE THIS RULE AND TO

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:44.737
MOVE FORWARD COLLECTING THIS

00:16:44.803 --> 00:16:46.572
IMPORTANT DATA.

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:47.172
THE WE BELIEVE THIS DECISION.

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:48.474
MAY BE APPEALED IT APPEARS MORE

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.274
AND MORE INEVITABLE THIS DATA IS

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:51.043
GOING TO BE COLLECTED SOONER.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.578
RATHER THAN LATER AT THE FEDERAL

00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:54.279
LEVEL MAKING THE REQUEST OF THIS

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:56.582
BILL EVEN EASIER AND CALIFORNIA

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.250
EMPLOYERS BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA

00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:00.386
BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDED UNDER

00:17:00.452 --> 00:17:03.188
THE FEDERAL LAW -- MODEL CLOSELY

00:17:03.255 --> 00:17:07.159
AFTER THE EOC ORDER SB ONE

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:07.659
SEVENTY ONE WILL REQUIRE

00:17:07.726 --> 00:17:09.928
EMPLOYERS WITH A HUNDRED OR MORE

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:11.964
EMPLOYEES AND I WANT TO

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.867
EMPHASIZE. TO EMPHASIZE THAT

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:17.403
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT YOUR MOM

00:17:17.469 --> 00:17:18.904
AND POP SHOP BUT A COMPANY WITH

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:22.541
A HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES --

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:24.910
TO SUBMIT A PAY DATA REPORT

00:17:24.977 --> 00:17:26.879
ANNUALLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:17:26.945 --> 00:17:28.247
FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING

00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:29.982
OUTLINING THE COMPENSATION IN

00:17:30.048 --> 00:17:31.784
HOURS WORKED OF EMPLOYEES BY

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:32.651
GENDER.

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:35.654
RACE ETHNICITY AND JOB CATEGORY

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.423
AND I SHOULD NOTE IF THEY HAVE

00:17:37.489 --> 00:17:38.824
TO REPORT THE SAME OR SIMILAR

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.926
DATA TO THE FEDS WILL ALLOW THE

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:44.730
SUBMISSION OF THE EO ONE FORM.

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:46.198
FOR OUR STATE AGENCIES AS WELL

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:47.966
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DUPLICATE

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:49.768
THE PROCESS USING THE SAME FORM

00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:50.936
THAT EXISTS.

00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:52.604
AND THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TWO

00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:53.305
FOLD.

00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:55.541
FIRST TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO

00:17:55.607 --> 00:17:57.609
ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY PRACTICES

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:59.878
AND ALLOW FOR SELF EVALUATION

00:17:59.945 --> 00:18:02.815
AND SELF CORRECTION IN OTHER

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:04.450
WORDS THAT LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:05.651
TO TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:07.152
FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:08.921
TOGETHER IMPORTANT DATA THAT

00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:10.889
ALLOWS THEM TO SEE PATTERNS OF

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.858
WAGE DISPARITIES AND IF THEY

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.027
NOTICED THE STEVE DEVIATIONS OR

00:18:15.093 --> 00:18:16.628
WHAT WE CALL OUT LIARS TO

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:18.197
INVESTIGATE THEM FURTHER.

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:19.465
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THOUGH

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:20.833
BASED ON SOME OF THE INFORMATION

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:22.768
THAT'S OUT THERE TO NOTE THE

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:24.336
WHAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DO.

00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:26.205
THE BILL IS NOT ABOUT PUBLIC

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:27.206
SHAMING AND I WANT TO BE REALLY

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:30.375
CLEAR ABOUT THAT MY GOAL HERE IS

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:32.211
TO NOT TO SHAME ANY COMPANY BUT

00:18:32.277 --> 00:18:33.979
TO EDUCATE THEM AND TO GET THEM

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:35.814
TO DO THE RIGHT THING I BELIEVE

00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:37.649
UNTIL I'M PROVEN WRONG.

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:39.551
THAT WHEN EMPLOYERS KNOW THAT

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:41.053
WHAT THEY'RE DOING DOES IN FACT

00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:42.754
DISCRIMINATION AND A LOT OF THAT

00:18:42.821 --> 00:18:43.889
DISCRIMINATION IS ALREADY

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.757
UNLAWFUL THAT THEY WILL CORRECT

00:18:45.824 --> 00:18:46.992
THEIR POLICIES.

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.861
AND THAT IS THE GOAL HERE SO IT

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:50.095
IS NOT TO SHAME.

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:53.365
ARE A NOR WILL IT EXPOSED

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.900
EMPLOYEES PRIVATE FINANCIAL.

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.468
PUBLIC AND I'VE DONE SOMETHING I

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:59.071
DON'T USUALLY DO -- I HAVE ALSO

00:18:59.137 --> 00:19:00.806
INCLUDED THAT THIS BILL WILL

00:19:00.873 --> 00:19:02.674
PROHIBIT PUBLIC RECORD ACT

00:19:02.741 --> 00:19:04.142
DISCLOSURE.

00:19:04.209 --> 00:19:06.278
SO THE COMPANIES WE'LL BE ABLE

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:08.747
TO DEAL HONESTLY AND ACCURATELY

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:11.350
WITHOUT THE THE THE WORRY THAT --

00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:13.519
THE INFORMATION WILL ULTIMATELY

00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:15.854
BE MADE AVAILABLE -- WE HAVE

00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:17.155
BEEN ABLE TO GET SUPPORT.

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:19.291
ON THIS OR OR THE THAT GROUPS

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:20.926
THE GENERALLY WANT THE PUBLIC

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.794
RECORDS DISCLOSURE HAVE ACCEPTED

00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:24.763
THIS I BELIEVE I DON'T BELIEVE

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.998
WE HAVE ANY OTHER.

00:19:26.064 --> 00:19:27.432
OBJECTION FROM THEM IT'S IT'S

00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:28.934
SORT OF A HARD PILL FOR ME TO

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.202
SWALLOW BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:32.437
TRANSPARENCY BUT AGAIN THE GOAL

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.406
HERE IS TO GET COMPLIANCE AND

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:36.842
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:38.877
ACCOMPLISH -- SO OF THIS IS BEEN

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:40.412
GOING ON AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:41.780
THEY'VE HD NO ISSUE.

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:43.382
WITH ON TOWARD DISCLOSURE OF

00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:45.083
THIS DATA IN THE FIFTY PLUS

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.419
YEARS CENSUS FORMS BEEN IN PLACE.

00:19:47.486 --> 00:19:48.754
THIS DATA WILL PROVIDE THE

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.821
BIRD'S-EYE VIEW AND PAY

00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:52.024
DISPARITY AND OCCUPATIONAL

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:53.792
SEGREGATION WHICH WE BELIEVE IS

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:56.028
PROBABLY -- ALSO A SIGNIFICANT

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:57.996
ISSUE THE INFORMATION IS NOT

00:19:58.063 --> 00:19:59.665
INTENDED CANNOT BE USED TO

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:01.466
ENFORCE THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PAY

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:03.502
ACT WHICH I AUTHORED THAT KIND

00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:04.736
OF INFORMATION ABOUT

00:20:04.803 --> 00:20:06.238
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK IN

00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:07.906
BONA FIDE.

00:20:07.973 --> 00:20:09.474
REASONS FOR PAY DIFFERENTIALS IS

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:11.643
NOT PART OF THIS REPORT THAT'S

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:12.544
NOT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:13.645
ASCERTAIN.

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:15.213
AND EMPLOYERS WILL NOT BE

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.316
EXPOSED IN THAT MANNER SO THIS

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:19.351
IS A TOOL. TO SHED LIGHT ON

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:21.820
TRENDS IN ON THE BIG PICTURE --

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:23.789
EQUAL PASTING IN THE LONG

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:25.891
CALIFORNIA FOR SEVENTY YEARS IT

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:27.626
RECENT TO THE STUDIES PREDICT

00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:29.928
WE'RE STILL NOT MOVING TOWARDS --

00:20:29.995 --> 00:20:34.433
THAT GOAL WE MAY NOT GET IT.

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:35.033
FOR GOODNESS ALMOST A HUNDRED

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:35.801
YEARS IF WE DO NOT MAKE THESE

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:37.970
CHANGES 40% OF HOUSEHOLDS HAVE

00:20:38.036 --> 00:20:43.642
WOMEN IS THE SOUL OF WE NEED TO

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:44.843
SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES AND WE

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.178
SHOULD BE PAID EQUALLY AND

00:20:46.244 --> 00:20:47.746
FAIRLY FOR THE WORK WE DO.

00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:49.381
THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE

00:20:49.448 --> 00:20:51.383
TOOLS IN THE TOOL KIT AND WITH

DATA REPORTING RULE AND JUST

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:27.519
EXPLAIN WHY THESE REPORTS WILL

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:28.920
HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:30.022
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE

00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:31.757
ONGOING RACE AND GENDER WAGE

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:32.824
GAPS?

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:33.925
SO FIRST I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:35.394
TO FULLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.029
THAT WENT INTO THE FEDERAL

00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:39.264
REPORTING REVISED -- FOR EO ONE

00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:40.565
REPORTS SO THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT

00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:42.401
OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION THE EOC

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:44.770
BACK IN -- TWO THOUSAND TEN JOIN

00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:47.339
OTHER EDERAL AGENCIES TO COME

00:21:47.406 --> 00:21:49.274
UP WITH A WAY TO BETTER SO THAT

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:50.042
THEY CAN COME UP WITH A BETTER

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:51.209
WAY TO ENFORCE OUR HE

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:52.444
DISCRIMINATION LAWS.

00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:54.980
AND SO BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN

00:21:55.047 --> 00:21:56.615
THEY ISSUED A STUDY -- THE

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:59.885
NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES

00:21:59.951 --> 00:22:00.719
ISSUED A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT.

00:22:00.786 --> 00:22:01.553
TALKING ABOUT THE VALUE OF

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.021
ENFORCEMENT OF COLLECTION OF PAY

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:04.990
DATA FOR FROM EMPLOYERS BY SEX

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:06.558
RACE AND NATIONAL ORIGIN.

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:08.694
THROUGH A SURVEY SUCH AS THE EO

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.428
ONE THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:10.796
SCIENCES ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT

00:22:10.862 --> 00:22:13.198
THE EEOC CONDUCT A PILOT STUDY.

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:14.599
TO INFORM THE PARAMETERS OF A

00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:16.635
PAY DATA COLLECTION WHICH THEY

00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:18.403
DID AND THIS -- THIS PILOT STUDY

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:20.005
MADE TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

00:22:20.072 --> 00:22:21.440
ABOUT CENTRAL COMPONENTS OF PAY

00:22:21.506 --> 00:22:23.275
DATA COLLECTION INCLUDING THE

00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:24.843
UNIT OF PAY TO BE COLLECTED THE

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.144
BEST SUMMARY MEASURES OF RATES

00:22:26.211 --> 00:22:27.112
OF PAY.

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:28.580
APPROPRIATE STATISTICAL TESTS

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:30.282
FOR ANALYZING PAY DATA REPORTS

00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:31.717
AND THE MOST EFFICIENT AND LEAST

00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:33.351
COSTLY METHODS FOR TRANSMITTING

00:22:33.418 --> 00:22:35.554
PAY DATA FROM EMPLOYERS.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.688
AND SO ACCORDING TO THE EEOC IS

00:22:36.755 --> 00:22:38.590
CALCULATION IT ONLY TAKES

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:39.791
FIFTEEN HOURS FOR THESE REPORTS

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:41.093
TO BE PUT TOGETHER.

00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:43.261
AND THE EDT IS MOST RECENT DATA

00:22:43.328 --> 00:22:44.629
SHOWS THAT LESS THAN 2% OF

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:46.264
CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES HAVE A

00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:47.666
HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES.

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:50.068
GET THAT COVERS THE EMPLOYEE 44%

00:22:50.135 --> 00:22:51.503
OF CALIFORNIANS WORK FORCE

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:52.671
SEVERAL ONLY IMPACTING A

00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:53.872
RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:54.940
BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA YET

00:22:55.006 --> 00:22:56.508
WERE POTENTIALLY BENEFITING

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:58.977
ALMOST HALF OF CALIFORNIA

00:22:59.044 --> 00:22:59.878
WORKERS.

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:00.512
AND IT'S IMPORTANT KEEP IN MIND

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:01.279
THAT EMPLOYERS ARE ALREADY

00:23:01.346 --> 00:23:02.380
GEARING UP TO PRESENT HIS

00:23:02.447 --> 00:23:03.749
REPORTS ANYWAY.

00:23:03.815 --> 00:23:04.983
BEFORE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.752
PUT A HALT TO IT AND I SENATOR

00:23:06.818 --> 00:23:08.086
JACKSON MENTIONED THERE WAS A

00:23:08.153 --> 00:23:10.555
RECENT GOOD DECISION AND ON THE

00:23:10.622 --> 00:23:13.325
DC COURT -- THERE WAS A A BLOG

00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:15.560
FROM A ONE OF THE LARGEST

00:23:15.627 --> 00:23:17.996
EMPLOYER DEFENSE FIRMS THAT --

00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:19.798
WROTE AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:22.334
RECENT DC DECISION BUT THEN ALSO

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.468
WROTE THAT THERE'S A REPRIEVE

00:23:23.535 --> 00:23:24.836
BECAUSE THE EO ONE FORMS HAVEN'T

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:26.438
BEEN UPDATED H

00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:27.939
BUT WHAT THIS ARTICLE SAID IT

00:23:28.006 --> 00:23:29.241
ADVISED EMPLOYERS THAT THEY

00:23:29.307 --> 00:23:30.776
SHOULD QUOTE STILL BE PREPARED

00:23:30.842 --> 00:23:32.077
FOR THIS TO CHANGE AT A MOMENT'S

00:23:32.144 --> 00:23:33.245
NOTICE AND SHOULD BEGIN

00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:34.880
PREPARING FOR SUCH PAY

00:23:34.946 --> 00:23:36.281
DISCLOSURES IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

00:23:36.348 --> 00:23:37.082
SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A PRETTY

00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:39.050
BROAD UNDERSTANDING FROM EVEN

00:23:39.117 --> 00:23:40.185
WITHIN THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:41.553
THAT THESE PAY DATA REPORTING

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.121
REQUIREMENTS WILL EVENTUALLY GO

00:23:43.188 --> 00:23:44.990
INTO A FACT ALL THIS BILL DOES

00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:46.558
IS GET THINGS MOVING.

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:47.959
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:23:48.026 --> 00:23:49.161
AND THE REAL QUICKLY WHAT IS

00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:51.196
INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT I THINK

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:52.764
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EQUAL PAY WE

00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:54.065
TYPICALLY TALK ABOUT IT IN TERMS

00:23:54.132 --> 00:23:56.101
OF WHAT IS EMPLOYEE A WHO IS A

00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:57.469
WOMAN A PERSON OF COLOR.

00:23:57.536 --> 00:23:59.271
MAKING COMPARED TO EMPLOYEE BE

00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:01.339
WHO IS A WHITE MAN AND IS THERE

00:24:01.406 --> 00:24:02.974
A WAGE DISPARITY IN CANNOT BE

00:24:03.041 --> 00:24:04.075
EXPLAINED.

00:24:04.142 --> 00:24:06.645
AND OFTEN THERE IS AN UNLAWFUL

00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:08.246
WAGE DISPARITY IN THAT IS

00:24:08.313 --> 00:24:09.281
CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL WAGE

00:24:09.347 --> 00:24:09.714
GAP.

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:11.216
BUT WHAT GETS LESS ATTENTION BUT

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:12.651
IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS

00:24:12.717 --> 00:24:14.319
OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION AND

00:24:14.386 --> 00:24:16.154
HIRING AND PROMOTION PATTERNS

00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:17.956
THAT ARE CAUSING WOMEN AND

00:24:18.023 --> 00:24:19.424
PEOPLE OF COLOR TO BE.

00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:20.992
OVERLY REPRESENTED AN OVERLY

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:22.694
CONCENTRATED IN THE LOWEST

00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:24.062
PAYING JOBS.

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:25.297
SO.

00:24:25.363 --> 00:24:26.598
WHAT THIS BILL WILL DEAL WITH

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:27.699
THESE REPORTS WILL DO WILL GIVE

00:24:27.766 --> 00:24:29.067
US THAT HIGH LEVEL LOOKS SO WE

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:30.669
CAN SEE WHERE THOSE PAY PATTERNS

00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:32.604
EXIST WE'VE SEEN LARGE EMPLOYERS

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:34.105
LIKE SALES FORCE THE GAP

00:24:34.172 --> 00:24:35.674
STARBUCKS VOLUNTARILY PUT

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.475
TOGETHER THESE PAY AUDIT REPORTS

00:24:37.542 --> 00:24:37.909
AND WHAT?

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:39.110
THEY WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT

00:24:39.177 --> 00:24:41.012
IT ALLOWS THEM TO IDENTIFY WHERE

00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:42.113
THERE ARE WEAK SPOTS.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.648
WHERE OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION

00:24:43.715 --> 00:24:45.584
IS IMPACTING THE OVERALL WAGE

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.419
DISTRIBUTION AND AGAIN IS IT

00:24:47.485 --> 00:24:49.187
CAUSING WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR TO

00:24:49.254 --> 00:24:50.856
BE OVERLY CONCENTRATED OVERLY

00:24:50.922 --> 00:24:52.257
REPRESENTED IN THESE LOWER

00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:54.259
PAYING JOBS WHEN YOU HAVE? 80%

00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:56.061
OF ALL AGES GOING TO HANDFUL

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.162
WHITE MEN.

00:24:57.229 --> 00:25:00.131
NOW DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE'S

00:25:00.198 --> 00:25:01.499
AN EQUAL PACKED BY ELATION NOT

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:02.400
NECESSARILY -- BUT IT DOES MEAN

00:25:02.467 --> 00:25:03.668
THAT THOSE EMPLOYER SHOULD BE

00:25:03.735 --> 00:25:05.570
LOOKING AT THEIR PAY PRACTICES

00:25:05.637 --> 00:25:07.572
THEIR PROMOTION PRACTICES TO TRY

00:25:07.639 --> 00:25:08.874
TO FIGURE OUT WHY THOSE PATTERNS

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.009
IS IT EXIST AND WHAT THEY CAN DO

00:25:11.076 --> 00:25:14.279
BETTER -- AND IN TERMS OF HOW

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:15.513
THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THE

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.615
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:17.916
HOUSING CAN USE THIS DATA.

00:25:17.983 --> 00:25:20.085
THEY CAN LOOK AT PATTERNS ACROSS

00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:21.453
INDUSTRIES AND WITHIN INTO

00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:23.388
INDUSTRIES SO HOW DOES THE TECH

00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:24.656
SECTOR COMPARED TO THE

00:25:24.723 --> 00:25:26.091
HEALTHCARE SECTOR.

00:25:26.157 --> 00:25:27.692
WHO HAS THE HIGHEST PAID JOBS

00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:29.294
WHO HAS THE LOWEST PAID JOBS?

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:30.495
AND IT ALSO WOULD ALLOW THE

00:25:30.562 --> 00:25:31.363
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

00:25:31.429 --> 00:25:33.765
HOUSING TO IDENTIFY THE OUTLIERS

00:25:33.832 --> 00:25:35.500
WITHIN INDUSTRIES ARE THERE

00:25:35.567 --> 00:25:37.435
COMPANIES THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY

00:25:37.502 --> 00:25:39.070
SHOWING THAT SAY.

00:25:39.137 --> 00:25:40.138
ADMINISTRATIVE EMPLOYEES OR

00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:43.508
WOMEN ARE PAID 3240% LESS THAN

00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:44.142
ADMINISTRATIVE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:45.243
MEN.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.011
AND AGAIN DOES THAT MEAN THAT

00:25:46.077 --> 00:25:47.178
THERE'S AN EAGLE PAD VIOLATION

00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:48.680
OR PAY DISCRIMINATION VIOLATION

00:25:48.747 --> 00:25:50.815
NOT NECESSARILY BUT IT DOES MEAN

00:25:50.882 --> 00:25:51.850
THAT IT SHOULD DESERVE FURTHER

00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:52.817
SCRUTINY IN THIS THAT'S WHAT

00:25:52.884 --> 00:25:54.419
THIS THESE REPORTS WERE ALLOWED

00:25:54.486 --> 00:25:56.021
OUR STATE AGENCIES TO DO.

00:25:56.087 --> 00:25:56.888
SO WE THINK THAT THIS IS AN

00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:58.423
EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE TOOL

00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.691
THAT WILL PROMPT US HISTORY

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:02.127
CHANGES AS WE HAVE SEEN WITH THE

00:26:02.193 --> 00:26:03.061
COMPANIES THAT HAVE THAT DONE

00:26:03.128 --> 00:26:04.129
THIS VOLUNTARILY.

00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:06.464
AND SERVER THESE REASONS WE ARE

00:26:06.531 --> 00:26:10.035
STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL

00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:13.438
ENERGY ABOUT EITHER.

00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:13.972
GOOD MORNING SHANNON SMITH

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:14.606
CROWLEY REVERSING THE AMERICAN

00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:16.241
ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:17.309
I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT TO ADD

00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:19.010
THE TERRIFIC TEST MANY ONE THING

00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:21.279
ON ON THE EAGLE -- ONE FORM

00:26:21.346 --> 00:26:22.447
THOUGH I DID WANT TO I THOUGHT.

00:26:22.514 --> 00:26:24.416
I TOOK NOTE OF WAS I THINK IT

00:26:24.482 --> 00:26:26.084
WAS AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED

00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:28.219
AND THIRTY SIX DOLLARS PER

00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:30.922
EMPLOYER PER YEAR. TO FILE THIS

00:26:30.989 --> 00:26:32.057
THIS ADDITIONAL FORM.

00:26:32.123 --> 00:26:37.062
AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT IS.

00:26:37.128 --> 00:26:38.463
SENATOR JACKSON SAID.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.899
IT IS TAKING SO LONG TO CLOSE

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:42.400
THE GENDER PAY GAP IN FACT.

00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:44.002
THE MOST RECENT DATA FROM

00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:45.470
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:47.505
UNIVERSITY WOMEN WOMEN --

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:50.375
LOOKING AT THE DATA FROM

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:51.676
200-022-00015.

00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:53.244
WAY BEFORE THAT WE SAID WAS

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:55.180
GOING TO TAKE ABOUT FIFTY YEARS

00:26:55.246 --> 00:26:56.681
TO CLOSE THE GENDER PAY GAP.

00:26:56.748 --> 00:26:59.217
LOOKING AT THE MORE RECENT DATA.

00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:03.321
IT'S A HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS.

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:04.856
WE ALSO LOOK AT WHY.

00:27:04.923 --> 00:27:06.624
THAT WERE HAVING THIS AND WE'RE

00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:08.093
LOOKING AT THE STUDIES THAT SAY.

00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:11.663
ONLY ABOUT 6212% OF THIS.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.465
IS BELIEVED TO BE OUT RIGHT

00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:15.834
DISCRIMINATION OR BIAS.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.602
BUT IT'S NOT THE EMPLOYER WAKING

00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:19.204
UP IN THE MORNING AND HOW AM I

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.638
GOING TO PAY PAY WOMEN LESS.

00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:22.407
ITS PERPETUATION OF THE STATUS

00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:25.076
QUO AND WE'VE DONE A LOT IN THE

00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:26.511
LAST FEW YEARS FOR INSTANCE --

00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:28.346
LIMITING THE USE OF ASKING

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:29.581
SOMEBODY ABOUT THEIR PRIOR

00:27:29.647 --> 00:27:31.116
SALARY IF IT WAS LOW IT JUST IS

00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:32.450
GOING TO CONTINUE INTO THEIR

00:27:32.517 --> 00:27:33.385
NEXT JOB.

00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:34.786
BUT A LOT OF IT IS JUST LIKE.

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:35.954
TAKING YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE HOW

00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:37.355
DO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD

00:27:37.422 --> 00:27:38.723
PRESSURE YOU NEED TO TREAT.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:39.691
UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY HAPPEN

00:27:39.758 --> 00:27:41.126
HAVEN'T MEASURED.

00:27:41.192 --> 00:27:43.461
SO THIS -- THIS IS VERY

00:27:43.528 --> 00:27:45.930
IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF WOMEN'S IN

00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:47.732
OF THE LONG TERM ECONOMIC.

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:49.234
IMPACT ON WOMEN IN THEIR

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.635
FAMILY'S BEEN ABLE TO SAVE FOR

00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:51.703
RETIREMENT.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.371
BEING ABLE TO TO HELP PAY FOR

00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:55.440
CHILDREN SCHOOL AND LOOKING AT

00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:57.175
THE NUMBER OF WOMEN RIGHT NOW

00:27:57.242 --> 00:27:59.744
THAT ARE ON A LOT OF PUBLIC

00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:00.412
BENEFITS.

00:28:00.478 --> 00:28:01.112
THEY WOULDN'T NEED TO BE ON THAT

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:03.748
IF THEY WERE MAKING EQUAL PAY.

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:07.152
SO WE HAVE THREE I HAVE A

00:28:07.218 --> 00:28:14.092
NEITHER.

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:16.428
MR WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR

GOOD MORNING MANY MEMBERS AND

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:45.490
STAFF WE APPRECIATE THE

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:46.925
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY

00:28:46.991 --> 00:28:48.259
NAME'S LAURA CURTIS AND I'M HERE

00:28:48.326 --> 00:28:49.194
ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.428
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:51.996
FIRST I DO WANT TO COMMENT THAT

00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:53.765
THIS BILLS VERSION LAST YEAR WAS

00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:55.733
A CAL CHAMBER JOB KILLER -- THE

AUTHOR WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH US

00:28:57.268 --> 00:28:58.937
IN GOOD FAITH TO AMEND THE BILL

00:28:59.003 --> 00:29:00.305
AND IN ORDER TO ADD THOSE

00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:01.606
PROVISIONS THAT SHE DISCUSSED

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:03.575
REGARDING THE RECORDS REQUEST

00:29:03.641 --> 00:29:05.543
ACT AND AND OTHER ITEMS -- AND

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.112
SO WE ARE STILL IN IN A POST

00:29:07.178 --> 00:29:09.180
POSITION THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF

00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:11.116
THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT AND

00:29:11.182 --> 00:29:13.118
THE REASON BEING IS THAT YES

00:29:13.184 --> 00:29:15.053
WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.321
NOW OR THE FEDERAL COURTS HAVE

00:29:16.387 --> 00:29:17.055
NOW SAID.

00:29:17.122 --> 00:29:18.857
THAT TO THE EO ONE REPORT WILL

00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:22.827
BE REQUIRED WE ARE AM.

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:24.028
KILLED AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW

00:29:24.095 --> 00:29:25.663
LONG THAT APPEAL PROCESS WILL GO

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.632
ON AND SO THAT'S OUR CONCERN AS

00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:29.334
OF RIGHT NOW WITH REGARD TO THAT

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.536
UNDERLYING ISSUES WITH THIS FORM

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:32.871
AND THE REQUIREMENTS.

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:33.738
ARE THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO

00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:36.007
ACTUALLY SHOW THE WAGE DISPARITY

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:37.709
AND THAT THE EQUAL PAY ACT WAS

00:29:37.775 --> 00:29:39.477
GOING AFTER AND THAT'S THE FACT

00:29:39.544 --> 00:29:41.412
THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO CHAU

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:43.014
UNLAWFUL WAGE DISPARITY -- YOU

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:45.049
ACTUALLY FOR THE MOST PART WE DO

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.117
WE DON'T WANT UNLAWFUL WHICH

00:29:46.184 --> 00:29:47.719
SEVERITY BUT WE DO WANT WAGE

00:29:47.785 --> 00:29:49.354
DISPARITY IN SOME REGARD YOU

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.855
WANT TO BE ABLE TO PAY YOUR

00:29:50.922 --> 00:29:52.357
EMPLOYEES MORE IF THEY'VE BEEN

00:29:52.423 --> 00:29:53.725
WITH THE COMPANY FOR LONGER SO

00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:55.026
IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT'S BEEN

00:29:55.093 --> 00:29:55.960
THERE FOR TWO WEEKS.

00:29:56.027 --> 00:29:57.095
VERSUS SOMEONE THAT'S BEEN WITH

00:29:57.162 --> 00:29:58.363
YOU FOR THIRTY YEARS YOU WANT TO

00:29:58.429 --> 00:29:59.931
BE ABLE TO REWARD THAT PERSON

00:29:59.998 --> 00:30:01.232
THEY WOULD HAVE THE EXACTSAME

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:03.301
JOB TITLE SO ON THIS REPORT IT

00:30:03.368 --> 00:30:04.769
WOULD SHOW THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:06.171
WAS MAKING MORE AND ONE

00:30:06.237 --> 00:30:07.672
INDIVIDUALS MAKING LESS.

00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:08.973
AND REGARDING GENDER THAT COULD

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.642
BE SHOWN THAT THE MALES MAKING

00:30:10.708 --> 00:30:12.243
MORE OF THE FEMALES MAKING MORE

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.778
BUT THIS AGGREGATE DATA IS NOT

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:15.747
GOING TO SHOW WHY THOSE TO AND

00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:16.981
DIFFERENTIALS ARE THERE.

00:30:17.048 --> 00:30:18.016
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

00:30:18.082 --> 00:30:19.384
SHOW THAT THIS PERSON HAS BEEN

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:21.319
THERE FOR LONGER OR THIS PERSON

00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:23.087
HAD CAME IN WITH A HIGHER DEGREE

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:24.689
OR ANY OF THOSE ISSUES AND SO.

00:30:24.756 --> 00:30:26.124
THAT'S ARE CONCERNED THAT IT'S

00:30:26.191 --> 00:30:27.292
GOING TO SHOW THE WAGE --

00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:28.927
DISPARITY BUT NOT NECESSARILY

00:30:28.993 --> 00:30:30.795
THE UNLAWFUL WAGE DISPARITY --

00:30:30.862 --> 00:30:32.630
ADDITIONALLY WITH THAT -- WE DO

00:30:32.697 --> 00:30:34.532
FEEL THAT SB ONE SEVENTY ONE IS

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:35.833
PREMATURE IN THAT THE PAY EQUITY

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.135
TASK FORCE IS STILL COMING OUT

00:30:37.202 --> 00:30:38.336
WITH THE REPORTS.

00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:39.771
ON THE EQUAL PAY ACT AND

00:30:39.837 --> 00:30:41.940
ENFORCEMENT ON THAT ACT AND WHAT

00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:43.608
THAT -- BUT THE THEIR COMMENTS

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:45.543
ON THAT AND SO WE THINK THAT

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.111
UNTIL THOSE REPORTS ARE OUT AND

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:48.913
BEEN ANALYZED IN THE PACKWOOD HE

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.381
TAUGHT AND THE BAD EQUAL PACKED

00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:52.383
HAS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR LONGER.

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.085
ALLOWED EMPLOYERS TO COMPLY THEN

00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:55.820
AND THIS BILL IS PREMATURE AND

00:30:55.887 --> 00:30:56.988
THAT IT MIGHT REQUIRE THE

00:30:57.055 --> 00:30:57.855
ADDITIONAL REPORTING

00:30:57.922 --> 00:31:02.227
REQUIREMENTS FOR EMPLOYERS ARE

00:31:02.293 --> 00:31:02.727
IN LINE WITH THE FEDERAL

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:05.430
GOVERNMENT.

00:31:05.496 --> 00:31:06.030
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CRISTINA

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:06.531
KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF THE

00:31:06.598 --> 00:31:08.066
CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION

MECHANICS OF THE BILL IF YU

00:31:22.814 --> 00:31:24.749
WILL -- I THINK IS YOUR

00:31:24.816 --> 00:31:27.685
COMMITTEE HAS NOTED WELL ON PAGE

00:31:27.752 --> 00:31:29.254
FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.622
THE COMMITTEE MAY WISH TO

00:31:30.688 --> 00:31:33.558
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CLARITY --

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:35.526
ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE EO ONE

00:31:35.593 --> 00:31:39.330
FORM IN COMPLIANCE WITH SB --

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:40.064
ONE SEVEN ONE I'VE DRAFTED SOME

00:31:40.131 --> 00:31:42.033
SUGGESTED LANGUAGE OR THE

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.401
COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER BUT THE

00:31:43.468 --> 00:31:45.737
POINT IS IN SUBDIVISION HALF.

00:31:45.803 --> 00:31:47.705
OF THE BILL TO MAKE VERY CLEAR

00:31:47.772 --> 00:31:50.174
THAT THE ANNUAL FILING OF THE EO

00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:52.310
ONE FORM WOULD BE DEEMED. TO BE

00:31:52.377 --> 00:31:53.578
IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:57.081
PROVISIONS OF SB.

00:31:57.148 --> 00:31:57.582
ONE SEVEN ONE THE SECOND

00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:58.683
AMENDMENT THAT YOUR COMMITTEE

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.252
SUGGESTS AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE.

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:02.387
SEVEN WOULD CONCUR WITH THAT WE

00:32:02.453 --> 00:32:04.989
MERE THE FEDERAL PENALTIES FOR

00:32:05.056 --> 00:32:06.658
DISCLOSURE BY GOVERNMENTAL

00:32:06.724 --> 00:32:08.026
EMPLOYEES.

00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:10.662
THE LAST ITEM IS IN SECTION ONE

00:32:10.728 --> 00:32:12.864
OF THE BILL SUBDIVISION F. AS

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.133
WELL IN THE LAST SENTENCE -- WE

00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:16.734
WOULD LIKE TO SEE STRUCK THE OR

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:18.136
THROUGH THE NORMAL RULES OF

00:32:18.202 --> 00:32:20.505
DISCOVERY IN A CIVIL ACTION.

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:22.073
I THINK THE GOAL HERE IS TO

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.242
ENSURE IN FACT THAT THIS

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:25.576
INFORMATION WILL NOT BE

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:26.978
DISCLOSED.

00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:29.080
CLEARLY THE AUTHOR HAS INDICATED

00:32:29.147 --> 00:32:30.682
THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT

00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:32.417
TO A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST.

00:32:32.483 --> 00:32:35.853
IT SHOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.689
TO LATEST COUNCIL -- EITHER IN

00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:38.790
THAT REGARD.

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:40.625
AND THEN THE SECOND POINT IS

00:32:40.692 --> 00:32:42.093
CONCEPTUAL IDLE KNOW IF ANYONE'S

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.928
HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:45.196
THE AEO ONE FORM.

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:47.598
BUT USE UTILIZES BROAD JOB

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:49.634
CATEGORIES.

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:51.536
AND IT'S AN AGGREGATE NUMBER.

00:32:51.602 --> 00:32:52.603
SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THE

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.505
INFORMATION IN FACT I WOULD

00:32:54.572 --> 00:32:56.641
PROBABLY -- AGREE THAT IT WILL

00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:59.644
LIKELY SHOW A DISPARITY -- WHEN

00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:02.013
YOU AGGREGATE A LARGE NUMBER OF

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:02.780
PEOPLE?

00:33:02.847 --> 00:33:04.949
CATEGORIES YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE

00:33:05.016 --> 00:33:07.618
INTO ACCOUNT PEOPLE AT THE LOW

00:33:07.685 --> 00:33:08.953
END OF THE PAY SCALE TO THE HIGH

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.655
END OF THE PAY SCALE.

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:11.689
AND REMEMBER WHEN WE WORK

00:33:11.756 --> 00:33:13.524
DILIGENTLY WAS WAS SENATOR

00:33:13.591 --> 00:33:14.625

00:33:14.692 --> 00:33:17.662
PROPONENTS OF THIS EXACT BILL

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:19.263
ONE OR SB.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.098
THREE FIFTY EIGHT THE WE CHANGE

00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:23.701
THE DEFINITION OF EQUAL PAY FOR

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:25.236
I'M SORRY YES EQUAL PAY FOR

00:33:25.303 --> 00:33:28.373
EQUAL WORK TO EQUAL PAY FOR

00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:29.741
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR.

00:35:57.522 --> 00:35:58.756
IT DEALT.

00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:00.691

THAT AS THE SOLE SOURCE BUT I

00:36:07.098 --> 00:36:08.199
MEAN IT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:10.067
KIND OF SCAN AND SEE WHAT THE

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:11.702
OVERALL PICTURE IS.

00:36:11.769 --> 00:36:13.237
IS THAT IS THAT IN MY EXACTLY

00:36:13.304 --> 00:36:15.506
RIGHT IT AND NOT TO BE CONFUSED

00:36:26.117 --> 00:36:28.653
SO THE I I I WANNA MAKE SURE

00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:30.354
WE'RE NOT CONFUSING THE TO THIS

00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:34.225
IS TO LOOK AT SORT OF A THE THE

00:36:34.292 --> 00:36:36.327
THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW -- IT

00:36:36.394 --> 00:36:38.663
DESIGNED IN GREAT MEASURE TO

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:40.398
GIVE COMPANIES INFORMATION THAT

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:42.500
THEY MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OFF IN

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:43.634
THAT.

00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:45.870
THE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN

00:36:45.937 --> 00:36:47.572
THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES THE

00:36:47.638 --> 00:36:50.107
OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION WHICH

00:36:50.174 --> 00:36:51.309
WE BELIEVE.

00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:52.610
PUBLICLY DOES EXIST IN MANY

00:36:52.677 --> 00:36:54.845
COMPANIES AND THEN TO ALSO LOOK

00:36:54.912 --> 00:36:58.115
AT OUT LIARS WHERE IT MIGHT BE --

00:36:58.182 --> 00:37:00.751
EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT ALLOWING

00:37:00.818 --> 00:37:03.487
COMPANIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:06.524
ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS -- IT

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:09.527
AGAIN THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY.

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:11.362
DO TO WAGE DISPARITIES THAT ARE

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:12.697
UNLAWFUL THAT THE REFERENCE IT

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:14.765
WAS MADE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE THERE

00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:16.200
ARE OFTEN TIMES GOOD

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:18.302
JUSTIFICATIONS FOR WHY PEOPLE.

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:20.404
ARE PAID DIFFERENTLY -- I

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:22.807
SUSPECT WHAT WE'LL FIND IS THAT

00:37:22.873 --> 00:37:25.042
THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE MALE

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:26.611
EMPLOYEES.

00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:28.312
WHITE MALE EMPLOYEES HAVE GOTTEN

00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:30.414
INCREASES OVER FEMALE EMPLOYEES

00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:32.683
WHO MAY BE MORE QUALIFIED MORE

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.018
EXPERIENCED AT SCEPTER BUT

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:35.219
THAT'S HOW WITH THIS BILL IS

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:36.520
DESIGNED TO DO.

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:40.524
OKAY TO LOOK AT THE THE THE BIG

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:41.626
PICTURE.

00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:42.460
TO TO HAVE COMPANIES OF VALUE

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:45.196
WAIT IF AND WHY.

00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:48.265
THEY HAVE SUCH JOB SEGREGATION --

00:37:48.332 --> 00:37:49.800
N. N. IN HOPES THAT THEY WILL

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:51.535
CORRECT THOSE FOR THAT THEY WILL

00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:53.671
WORK AFFIRMATIVELY TO CORRECT

00:37:53.738 --> 00:37:54.205
THOSE.

00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:56.974
INSTANCES WHERE TO ALLOW D. FBIH

00:37:57.041 --> 00:37:58.676
IF THERE'S AN EXAMPLE AND OUT

00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:00.011
LIAR WHERE THEY'RE AT THE

00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:01.846
SITUATION IS MORE EXTREME TO BE

00:38:01.912 --> 00:38:03.714
ABLE TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE AND

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:04.582

00:38:10.287 --> 00:38:10.421
ELSE.

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:11.255
BUT WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING THIS

00:38:11.322 --> 00:38:12.923
BATTLE FOR EQUAL PAY FOR SEVENTY

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.960

CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE WORKS

ONLY WITHIN 2% OF THE EMPLOYERS.

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:40.251
THERE ARE A LOT OF BIG COMPANIES

00:38:40.317 --> 00:38:42.920
OUT THERE THAT ARE -- NEEDING TO

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:44.955

HOOK FOR FOR THAT THAT BENEFIT --

00:58:44.587 --> 00:58:45.722
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:58:45.788 --> 00:58:46.556
THE COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO

00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:48.791

REASONS STATED.

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:25.595
QUESTION FOR MEMBERS.

00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:28.498
I'M JUST WONDERING -- THIS IS

00:59:28.564 --> 00:59:30.667
NOT THE FAULT OF THE EMPLOYEE --

00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:34.003
YOU DON'T WANT TO THE EMPLOYER

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:36.506
TO TO HAVE TO PAY FOR TO TO JUST

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:37.473
FOR THAT.

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.209
WHO WHO WHO SUPPOSED TO TAKE

00:59:40.276 --> 00:59:42.712
RESPONSIBILITY IMPAIR THE BURDEN?

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:45.648
THAT'S WHAT CONFUSES ME HI.

00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:46.916
I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE THE

00:59:46.983 --> 00:59:51.754
EMPLOYEE IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT --

00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:52.121
THE EGG.

00:59:52.188 --> 00:59:54.357
YOU KNOW THE COUNTY DOESN'T WANT

00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:56.459
TO DO IT EVEN THOUGH IT.

00:59:56.526 --> 00:59:58.194
MAY BE THEIR FAULT AND COULD YOU

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:59.729
ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:01.631
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE PUTTING

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:03.900
THIS BURDEN ON THE EMPLOYEE SO

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:04.534
THE QUESTION BECOMES WHO WE PUT

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.070
IT ON I WOULD SAY THAT I

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:08.371
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.439
SENATOR JACKSON.

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:11.441
THIS IS THROUGH NO FAULT OF THE

01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:14.243
EMPLOYEE YOU WORK TWENTY FIVE

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:14.844
THIRTY THIRTY FIVE FORTY YEARS

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:16.646
YOU GO IN TO FIND OUT WHAT YOUR

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:18.014
PENSION IS GOING TO BE.

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:19.782
SOMEONE NOT YOURSELF YOU DON'T

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:20.783
EVEN KNOW THE PENSION

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.618
CALCULATION AS A ORKER SOMEONE

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:24.187
CALCULATE YOUR PENSION YOU'RE

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:25.488
TOLD YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE X.

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:27.991
AMOUNT OF DOLLARS -- PER MONTH

FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE FOR

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.094
WHATEVER THE TIME FRAME IS.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.329
AND THEN COME TO FIND OUT A YEAR

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:34.697
TWO YEARS TEN YEARS LATER IT'S

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:35.932
DISCOVERED THAT WHOEVER

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:37.500
CALCULATED IT.

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:38.968
MISCALCULATED IT AND NOW THE

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.370
EMPLOYING SUPPOSED TO PAY THAT

01:00:40.436 --> 01:00:42.538
MONEY BACK AND THAT IS THROUGH

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:43.706
NO FAULT OF THE EMPLOYEE PEOPLE

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:45.541
MAKE LIFE DECISIONS ON WHAT

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:46.509
THEY'RE TOLD.

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:48.211
OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT IT WAS A

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:49.946
MISTAKE BUT I COULDN'T AGREE

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:50.980
WITH YOU MORE THE EMPLOYEE

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:52.348
SHOULD NOT BE ON THE HOOK AND I

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:53.383
KNOW THE EMPLOYER DOESN'T LIKE

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:54.417
THAT IDEA.

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:55.885
THAT THEY WOULD BE ON THE HOOK

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:57.520
BUT YOU'RE CORRECT WHO ELSE

01:00:57.587 --> 01:00:58.287
SHOULD BE ON THE HOOK FOR THE

01:00:58.354 --> 01:00:59.088
MONEY.

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:00.223
LET'S MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:01.357
SO THE SYSTEM WELL THAT'S WHAT

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:02.959
I'M THINKING WHO WHO HAS

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:05.895
RESPONSIBILITY FOR GETTING IT

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:06.729
RIGHT.

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:07.296
I MEAN I'M ASSUMING THEY'RE

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:08.297
PROBABLY INSTANCES WHERE

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:09.732
EMPLOYEES ARE PAID LESS THAN THE

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:11.034
WHAT THEY'RE ENTITLED.

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.802
TO BECAUSE WE ALL I MEAN I LOOK

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.470
AT SOCIAL SECURITY THEY TELL YOU

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:15.671
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET.

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:19.175
AND YOU BASICALLY SAY OKAY -- IF

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:19.842
THAT'S WHAT I GET THAT'S WHAT I

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:21.577
GET AND YOU ASSUME THERE RIGHT

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.679
WHERE DO YOU GO TO FIND OUT TO

01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:25.848
GET THAT SECOND OPINION.

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:26.649
I MEAN SHOULD WE BE EXPECTING

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:28.017
EMPLOYEES TO GET A SECOND

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:31.287
OPINION I DON'T THINK SO BUT BUT

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:31.888
WHAT YOU KNOW.

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:34.557
IF I MAY OF SENATOR.

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:36.592
YOUR QUESTIONS ARE RIGHT ON

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:38.194
POINT I MEAN I DID HEAR.

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:39.395
THAT IT'S MORE MAKING THIS UNDER

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:40.563
PERCENT THE OBLIGATION OF THE

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:41.531
EMPLOYER AND THAT'S

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:42.999
APPROPRIATELY SO THE EMPLOYER

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:45.301
BARGAIN THIS FORM OF DEFERRED

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:46.602
COMPENSATION FOR THIS GROUP OF

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:47.970
EMPLOYEES.

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:49.405
AND SO WHEN IT'S DETERMINED THAT

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:51.774
IT'S DISALLOWED I'M NOT SURE WHY

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:53.076
THIS LANDS ON THE EMPLOYER BUT

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:54.110
THE EMPLOYER DOES HAVE THE

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:56.813
OBLIGATION TO ACCURATELY REPORT.

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:58.714
WHAT IS PENSION WILL

01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:00.349
COMPENSATION TO THE SYSTEM?

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:01.651
SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHO

01:02:01.717 --> 01:02:03.419
DECIDES WHAT IS THAT A

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:05.121
PENSIONABLE AMOUNT TOWARD WHERE

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:06.722
DO WE GO TO GET THAT ACCURATE

01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:08.291
INFORMATION PERHAPS.

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:10.259
WE SHOULD PUT THE ONUS ON THEM I

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:13.996
I BELIEVE CALPERS ALCULATES THE

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:15.364
RETIREMENT AMOUNT.

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:16.532
ALSO SOMEONE FROM CALPERS HERE

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:19.969
WHO CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:22.572
IF I MAY THE PREVIOUS POINT -- I

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:23.940
THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:25.475
THIS BILL DOES PARTICULARLY WELL

01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:27.844
IS IT ASK CALPERS TO DO A REVIEW

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:31.080
A REVIEW OF THE THE PROPOSED

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:34.016
CHANGES IN FUTURE CONTRACTS --

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:35.551
ADD TO TO PREVENT THIS FROM

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:37.120
HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE --

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:39.122
HOWEVER AS FAR AS THE THE OWNERS

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:40.756
OF OF PUTTING THIS ON THE WHOSE

01:02:40.823 --> 01:02:44.460
RESPONSIBILITY IT IS -- THIS

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:46.028
THIS DOES PUT THIS OTHER PERSON

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:48.798
ON EMPLOYER RIGHT NOW CALPERS

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.299
HAS THE ABILITY.

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:52.568
AND HAS IN THE PAST WAVE TO

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:54.170
THEIR THEIR LOVE SOME OF THE THE

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:55.605
THE AMOUNT THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN

01:02:55.671 --> 01:02:57.039
PAID TO THE EMPLOYEE -- THEY'VE

01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:58.608
THEY'VE SENT TO A BILL ASKING

01:02:58.674 --> 01:02:59.742
FOR BACK AND THEY HAVE THE

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:01.210
ABILITY TO WAIVE THAT AMOUNT

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:03.179
THEY'VE DONE SO IN THE PAST

01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:04.147
HOWEVER UNDER THIS BILL.

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:06.549
IT DOES NOT GRANT CALPERS THAT

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.718
AUTHORITY TO WAIVE THAT PORTION

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:10.786
IT IT DOES SAY THE EMPLOYER MUST

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:15.558
PAY IT -- I THINK THAT THEY'RE

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:16.959
THEY'RE THEY'RE THAT.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:18.027
THIS PUTS THE ONUS -- 1100% ON

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:19.095
THE EMPLOYER WHOSE

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:21.964
RESPONSIBILITY IT IS IT IS IT --

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:23.366
YEAH I THINK THAT IS NEAR THE

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:24.667
THE ULTIMATE QUESTION WE'VE WE

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:26.102
HAD AN AGREEMENT THE THE

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:28.771
EMPLOYERS CREATED THIS BENEFIT --

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:31.107
WENT TO CALPERS AS A AS A WAY TO

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:32.808
TRY PROVIDE A BENEFIT TO AN

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:35.478
EMPLOYEE -- THEY THEY BARGAIN TO

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:36.679
THIS THEY SAT DOWN THE PARKING

01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:38.047
UNIT THEY CAME TO AGREEMENT THAT

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:38.948
THIS IS WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:39.549
DO.

01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:41.117
BOTH THE BARGAINING UNIT AND THE

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:43.052
EMPLOYER WERE WRONG AND WHAT

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:44.487
THEY WHAT THEY AGREED TO

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:47.523
INSTABILITY CALPERS AND THEY

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.325
CAME TO AN UNLAWFUL AGREEMENT.

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:50.660
IS IT A 100% THE EMPLOYERS FROM --

01:03:50.726 --> 01:03:53.196
RESPONSIBILITY THAT POINT NOW.

01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:54.664
I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT IT

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:57.066
IS THE EMPLOYER'S RESPONSIBILITY

01:03:57.133 --> 01:03:57.900
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A

01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:59.769
MISTAKE IS UNLAWFUL I KNOW WHERE

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:00.403
YOU'RE TRYING TO GO WITH THIS

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:02.238
THAT BECAUSE IT ISN'T EXACTLY

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:03.439
WHAT YOU BARGAINED FOR THAT

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:04.974
PARTICULAR EMPLOYEE.

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:06.609
BECAUSE SOMEONE MADE A MISTAKE

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.144
MY ISSUE IS AND THE POINT OF

01:04:08.211 --> 01:04:10.379
THIS BILL IS THE EMPLOYEE THE

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:11.747
WORKER WHO PUT IN ALL THEIR TIME

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:12.415
DID EVERYTHING THEY WERE

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:14.116
SUPPOSED TO DO SHOULD NOT SUFFER

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:15.751
THE CONSEQUENCES OF SOMEONE

01:04:15.818 --> 01:04:16.919
ELSE'S MISTAKE.

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:18.221
SO IS THERE A WAY I MEAN WE

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:19.589
DON'T WANT THE MISTAKE IN THE

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:22.225
FIRST PLACE -- SO IS THERE SOME

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:26.195
WAY WE COULD -- TIGHTNESS OPTED

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:27.463
TO PUT THE RESPONSIBILITY

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:28.764
SHOULDN'T BE ON THE EMPLOYEE TO

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:29.932
RUN AROUND TRYING TO GET THAT TO

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:32.001
FIND AN ACTUARY WHO CAN DECIDE

01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:33.135
THIS I MEAN.

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:34.704
EITHERCALPERS OR THE EMPLOYER

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:35.738
IT SEEMED TO ME SHOULD BE THE

01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:37.240
ONES WHO ARE SORT OF

01:04:37.306 --> 01:04:39.141
GUARANTEEING THE ACCURACY OF THE

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:40.910
INFORMATION.

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:43.913
SO MAYBE THE QUESTIONS WERE --

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.982
IS IT IS IT THE IT IS A CALPERS

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:48.818
THAT THAT MESSED UP HERE IF YOU

01:04:48.884 --> 01:04:51.087
WILL OR IS THERE SOME WAY TO I

01:04:51.153 --> 01:04:52.588
MEAN I WISH THEY WERE HERE SO WE

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:54.523
COULD GET COULD KIND OF PUT THEM

01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:55.891
IN THE HOT SEAT A LITTLE BIT IS

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:56.926
THERE'S ARE YOU HERE.

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:58.995
FROM CALIFORNIA I'M WITH THE

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:03.099
LEAGUE IS IT IS JUST -- TO TO

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:03.733
THE POINT THE POINT IS IS THAT

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:04.267
WHEN WE SIT WHEN OUR UNIT

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:05.301
BARGAINING UNITS IN THIS IN THE

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:06.369
EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER IN

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:07.370
MUTUALLY AGREED TO NAME A FEW

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:08.671
THAT YOU SUBMIT THAT THAT

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.706
CONTRACT YOU CALPERS FOR THEIR

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:12.341
APPROVAL FOR RETIREMENT SERVICES

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:13.175
ABOUT BENEFIT.

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:14.977
SO DEMI DENTURE QUESTION UNITS

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:17.480
WOULD BE ON THE AGENCY TO VERIFY.

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:19.215
IF THOSE AT THAT THEY'VE WHAT

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:21.083
HAS BEEN AGREED TO WAS LAWFUL.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:23.386
AND IS ACTUALLY -- DEFERRED

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:26.222
COMPENSATION OR UNLOCK OR YEAH

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.990
CAN WE DON'T USE LAWFUL OF TELL

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:28.991
YOU WHY.

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:31.327
REALLY DISTURBS ME -- IT IMPLIES

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:32.662
THAT THE EMPLOYEE IS DOING

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:34.697
SOMETHING UNLAWFUL EMPLOYEES TO

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:37.099
ACCEPTING THE THE NUMBERS THAT

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:38.434
ARE BEING PROVIDED TO THE

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:40.002
EMPLOYEE FROM WHICH THEY WILL

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:41.003
THEN.

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:43.172
THE EITHER RECEIVER NOT RECEIVE

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:44.740
A RETIREMENT BENEFIT I I DON'T

01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:46.509
KNOW UNLAWFUL IS I JUST THINK IT

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:47.576
CAST.

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:49.145
AN INAPPROPRIATE PAUL ON THE

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:50.413
EMPLOYEE THE EMPLOYEE IS

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:52.181
ACCEPTING WHATEVER IT IS THAT

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:57.320
THE NUMBER IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:05:57.386 --> 01:05:59.722
GIVEN.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:00.823
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING AND AND

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:01.490
IF SO WHO DO WE WHO SHOULD TAKE

01:06:01.557 --> 01:06:02.458
RESPONSIBILITY LAWFULLY OR

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:04.627
UNLAWFULLY IS NOT THE ISSUE IT'S

01:06:04.694 --> 01:06:05.795
THE NUMBERS WRONG.

01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:07.596
THE THE THE AMOUNT IS ARGUABLY

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:08.631
TOO MUCH BUT I WILL BET YOU

01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:10.466
THERE INSTANCES WHERE THE WHERE

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:11.801
THE NUMBERS TOO LITTLE.

01:06:11.867 --> 01:06:13.169
HOW DO WE ASSURE THAT THE

01:06:13.235 --> 01:06:15.204
NUMBERS CORRECT THAT'S WHAT I'D

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:17.973
LIKE TO SEE US GET TO SENATOR

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.008
JACKSON I WOULD SAY?

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:20.276
I THINK MISTAKES WILL ALWAYS BE

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:22.411
MADE UNFORTUNATELY I THINK WE

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:24.046
CAN ALWAYS TIGHTEN THINGS UP I

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:25.581
AM HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:26.716
WITH CALPERS.

01:06:26.782 --> 01:06:28.718
AND FIND OUT HOW THIS HAPPENED

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:30.419
WHAT NOT MAKE SURE THEIR FOLKS

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:32.922
ARE TRAINED BUT I I AGREE I

01:06:32.988 --> 01:06:34.123
DON'T LIKE HEARING HAT IT'S

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:36.225
UNLAWFUL BECAUSE IT AGAIN.

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:38.694
IT IT CASTS A SHADOW ON THE

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:40.596
EMPLOYEE WHO WAS NOTHING WRONG

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:42.131
EXCEPT WORK AND DO WHAT THEY

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:43.299
WERE TOLD TO DO.

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:45.201
THEY WERE GIVEN THIS BENEFIT AND

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:46.802
NOW THEY'RE NOT ENTITLED TO IT

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:48.504
BECAUSE IT WAS MISCALCULATED OR

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:49.772
NOT ENTITLED TO WHAT THEY WERE

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.041
GIVEN SO I WILL SPEAK TO CALPERS

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:54.009
AND SEE IF WE CAN DO THAT BUT I

01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:55.444
WOULD AGREE WITH YOU 1100%.

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:56.712
THAT I'M SURE WELL PEOPLE BEEN

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:58.848
OVERPAID PEOPLE BEEN UNDERPAID

01:06:58.914 --> 01:07:00.616
AND THE EMPLOYERS ARE RUNNING

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.084
OUT AND SAYING TO THEM GOSH WE

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:05.888
OWE YOU MORE MONEY.

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:06.455
CANDIDLY THEY DON'T KNOW BUT

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:07.289
STILL.

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:08.424
A CONSIDER MAYBE JUST ONE MORE

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:10.126
COMMENT -- TO CLOSE ON THAT

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:13.062
CERTAINLY ISN'T THESE OPTIONS

01:07:13.129 --> 01:07:15.164
ARE AVAILABLE NOW.

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:16.098
BUT FOR HIS ARRIVAL TO RULES

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:17.566
THESE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:18.434
EMPLOYERS NOW THEY DON'T AVAIL

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:20.202
COMES OF IT SO I THINK WHAT THIS

01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:20.936
BILL WILL DO.

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:23.339
IS FLIP THE INCENTIVES.

01:07:23.406 --> 01:07:25.307
THANK YOU BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IF

STERN DETERMINED LATER TO BE

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:31.781
UNLAWFUL.

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:34.216
SIMPLER GOES.

01:07:34.283 --> 01:07:35.184
CAUSING THE EMPLOYEE GETS THE

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:35.985
LETTER THE RETIREES SO I THINK

01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:37.420
THIS IS JUST ABOUT.

01:07:37.486 --> 01:07:38.554
PUTTING THE RIGHT INCENTIVES IN

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.055
THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THE PARTIES

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:41.991
TO COME TO CALPERS AND AND CHECK

01:07:42.057 --> 01:07:43.459
OFF THEIR THEIR BARGAIN AND WILL

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:46.095
USE TO MAKE SURE NO ONE GETS PUT

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:47.930
IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE.

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:49.532
WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR WELCOME I

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:52.001

BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD --

01:08:02.311 --> 01:08:03.712
I'D SAY HEARD OF A VERSION OF

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:06.282
THIS BILL IS -- AND HERS -- LAST

01:08:06.348 --> 01:08:06.682
YEAR.

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:09.218
AND I I HAVE TO AGREE WITH WHAT

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:10.186
YOU SAID WHAT SIR JACKSON SAID

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:12.421
IT SHOULD NOT FALL ON THE

01:08:12.488 --> 01:08:14.290
EMPLOYEE THIS IS THE THE

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:19.128
EMPLOYEE ACTED THAT FAITH.

01:08:19.195 --> 01:08:20.262
AND FACT -- THE PARTICULAR CASE

01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:21.096
ALTHOUGH I THINK THIS BILL PLIES

01:08:21.163 --> 01:08:22.198
MORE BROADLY THAN ANY PARTICULAR

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:24.767
CASE -- EVEN CHECKED -- AND SO

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:26.569
PEOPLE MAKE PLANS STATE.

01:08:26.635 --> 01:08:28.304
AT SO IT'S BOTH HOW MUCH AGAIN

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:29.438
RETIREMENT BECAUSE ACTUALLY WHAT

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:31.040
WE'RE SAYING IS NOT TO BE CLOSE

01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:32.341
NOT ONLY DO IT IF THAT WAS THE

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:33.843
RESULT CLUB BACK THE MONEY IS

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:35.144
ALSO THE LOWER THE OVERALL

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:36.345
RETIREMENT RIGHT SO I MEAN DOES

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:39.281
A DOUBLE HIT IT WAS NOT JUST.

01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:40.349
ONE HIT.

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:43.018
AND AND SO WHEN THE VOICE ACTING

01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:44.720
IN GOOD FAITH -- THEN THEY

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:45.221
SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.355
PENALIZED I THINK WE ALSO NEED

01:08:46.422 --> 01:08:47.857
TO THINK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:49.458
BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PART RIGHT

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:50.159
SO.

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:51.527
THE EMPLOYEE THROUGH THE

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:52.428
BARGAINING UNIT HAS A

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:53.362
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR EMPLOYER

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:55.164
AND THEIR CERTAIN AGREEMENTS OR

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:56.398
PROMISES WERE MADE.

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:57.967
RIGHT AND THEN THE EMPLOYER THE

01:08:58.033 --> 01:08:59.635
CITY COUNTY WHATEVER HAS

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:01.103
RELATIONSHIPS WITH HERS TO

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:03.639
HANDLE THEIR RETIREMENT AND WHAT.

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:04.740
WHAT FITS AND WHAT DOESN'T FIT

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:05.708
IN THERE?

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:09.078
AND SO I THINK THAT -- AND THE

01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:11.847
OTHER PART IS OF COURSE PERS AB

01:09:11.914 --> 01:09:13.148
AS AN ENTITY AND I KNOW THEY'RE

01:09:13.215 --> 01:09:15.518
NOT HERE -- BUT AND I'M NOT GO

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:16.151
STRAIGHT SPEAK FOR THEM IN ANY

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:18.320
WAY -- BUT CERTAINLY WE WANT TO

01:09:18.387 --> 01:09:19.755
BE SURE THAT THAT RETIREMENT

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:22.625
FUND IS IS STABLE SO NOW WE HAVE

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:24.293
TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT THEY'RE

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.562
NOT HAVING TO SPEND MONEY THAT

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:27.663
IS INAPPROPRIATE.

01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:29.398
SO BUT I THINK THAT WHERE THIS

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:31.734
NEEDS TO BE SETTLED IF THERE WAS

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.668
AN ERROR BY.

01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:34.570
I WOULD SAY IS THAT OKAY WHO WHO

01:09:34.637 --> 01:09:35.504
GOT THE MONEY IN THE END RIGHT

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:37.006
AND WHO GOT THE MONEY TO

01:09:37.072 --> 01:09:38.440
REINVEST OR WHATEVER ELSE AND

01:09:38.507 --> 01:09:41.210
HOW THAT MONEY GETS THE COUNTED --

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:42.411
FOR SO BUT IT SHOULDN'T

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:43.312
CERTAINLY SHOULD FALL ON THE

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:46.348
EMPLOYEE IT SHOULD BE SO THERE'S

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:47.683
AN ISSUE.

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:48.384
SINCE THE EMPLOYEE HAS

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:49.885
RELATIONSHIP ON PLAYER MAKES

01:09:49.952 --> 01:09:50.486
SENSE FOR THE EMPLOYER TO SAY

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:52.388
OKAY YOU KNOW I HAVE TO PAY OUT

01:09:52.454 --> 01:09:54.223
BUT IF EMPLOYER FEELS THAT PURRS

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:55.624
ACT IN THE WAY THAT.

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.493
THEY'RE LIKE WE PAID MONEY AND

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.594
WE NEED TO GET SOME MONEY BACK

01:09:58.661 --> 01:09:59.762
TO FOR THAT CAN BE BETWEEN

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:01.997
EMPLOYER IN PERSON THAT'S RIGHT.

01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:03.766
RIGHT BUT THOSE TWO OUT OF TO

01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:11.307
GET OUT -- BUT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:11.840
THE EMPLOYEE CAUGHT IN THE

01:10:11.907 --> 01:10:12.841
MIDDLE.

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:14.543
IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES SO -- SO

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:16.011
WITH THAT I CERTAINLY -- AND

01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:17.046

01:10:17.112 --> 01:10:18.113

SPENDING VERY LARGE COLUMNS

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:15.009

AND I THINK IT'S IT'S A THIS

01:25:39.667 --> 01:25:41.269
WASN'T NECESSARILY INTENTIONAL

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:43.905

RELATED TO CLASSIFICATION OF OF

MORE -- DANGEROUS EXPOSURE TO

01:26:38.293 --> 01:26:39.294
THEIR EMPLOYMENT.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.929
AND THEY'RE TREATED FIRST AND

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:42.597
QUESTIONS ARE ASKED LATER IF

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:46.968

JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF OF

HOW MANY PEOPLE BE COVERED UNDER

01:27:02.383 --> 01:27:03.418

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:05.853
THERE ARE ABOUT EIGHTY SEVEN

01:27:23.104 --> 01:27:26.541
ABOUT 6% OR JUST OVER FIVE

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:27.742
THOUSAND ARE LEFT OUT.

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:29.310
IT'S A SMALL NUMBER BUT IT'S AN

01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:30.912
AND A NUMBER THAT.

01:27:30.979 --> 01:27:33.147
RUNS THE RISK OF BASICALLY NOT

01:27:33.214 --> 01:27:35.083
ONLY LOSING THEIR THEIR JOBS BUT

01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:37.118
OF OF GOING BANKRUPT SIMPLY

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:39.053
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT OFFERED.

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.355

WE HAVE WITH WHAT WE'VE BEEN

01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:35.762
ABLE TO COMPILE THAT.

01:55:35.828 --> 01:55:38.331
THAT COVERS THE THE THE FULL

01:55:38.398 --> 01:55:40.300
COHORT.

01:55:40.366 --> 01:55:41.567
AND AN INDIVIDUALLY I DON'T KNOW

01:55:41.634 --> 01:55:43.836
THAT WE CAN BREAK THAT DOWN BUT

01:55:43.903 --> 01:55:44.737

WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE THE

01:59:28.628 --> 01:59:31.831

YOU KNOW THEY'RE HAVING AN

01:59:39.939 --> 01:59:42.708
EQUITY.

01:59:42.775 --> 01:59:44.477
EXIST IN THIS SYSTEMS THAT

01:59:44.544 --> 01:59:47.413
APPLIES TO SOME OFFICERS.

01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:48.848
FOR MAYBE WHATEVER REASON OF

01:59:48.915 --> 01:59:51.350
MISS PERRY SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS.

01:59:51.417 --> 01:59:53.419
OF OR OR ALLUDED TO HIS

01:59:53.486 --> 01:59:56.155
EXPERIENCE THAT IT WAS -- CAME

01:59:56.222 --> 01:59:59.458
OUT ITS FUNCTION OF OF NEW -- OR

01:59:59.525 --> 02:00:01.394
OLD POSITIONS GIVEN THE NEW

02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:02.495
DUTIES.

02:00:02.562 --> 02:00:04.130
NEW POLICE OFFICER POWERS THAT

02:00:04.196 --> 02:00:05.898
DIDN'T EXIST -- THAT MAKES A LOT

02:00:05.965 --> 02:00:08.000
OF SENSE TO ME WHY WHY WOULD BE

02:00:08.067 --> 02:00:11.537
INCLUDED -- IS IS.

02:00:11.604 --> 02:00:13.439
THERE THERE IS NO ROOM REALLY

02:00:13.506 --> 02:00:15.107
GOOD ARGUMENT WHY WHY THAT.

02:00:15.174 --> 02:00:15.975
THAT WAS DONE.

02:00:16.042 --> 02:00:18.010
I THINK -- WE NEED TO CORRECT

02:00:18.077 --> 02:00:21.213
THAT -- THERE BE BE THERE WILL

02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:22.949
BE A COST BUT IT'S CUT COSTS

02:00:23.015 --> 02:00:24.684
WITHIN A SYSTEM THAT PEOPLE ARE

02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:26.385
PAID INTO PEOPLE ARE PAYING.

02:00:26.452 --> 02:00:28.421
WORKERS COMPENSATION DEDUCTIONS

02:00:28.487 --> 02:00:31.524
FROM THEIR CHECKS -- THERE WILL

02:00:31.591 --> 02:00:34.126
BE AS AS AS MENTIONED HERE IN

02:00:34.193 --> 02:00:35.728
THE PRESENTATION SAVINGS IN

02:00:35.795 --> 02:00:37.029
OTHER AREAS.

02:00:37.096 --> 02:00:39.632
THAT ARE COVERED BUT I THINK

02:00:39.699 --> 02:00:40.633
THIS.

02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:41.434
I THINK THE COST WILL WILL

02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:43.669
BALANCE OUT.

02:00:43.736 --> 02:00:45.638
OVERALL IN THE SYSTEM THE MOST

02:00:45.705 --> 02:00:47.807
IMPORTANT PART I THINK.

02:00:47.873 --> 02:00:49.609
THAT THAT WE NEED -- TO MENTION

02:00:49.675 --> 02:00:52.044
SAID THIS DOESN'T COME AT A COST

02:00:52.111 --> 02:00:53.079
TO THE OFFICERS WERE YOU

02:00:53.145 --> 02:00:54.280
BASICALLY PUT THEM OUT IN THE

02:00:54.347 --> 02:00:55.948
STREET.

02:00:56.015 --> 02:00:57.750
WHERE WE'VE WOULD CREATE

02:00:57.817 --> 02:01:00.353
INDIVIDUALS THAT GO INTO?

02:01:00.419 --> 02:01:02.521
BANKRUPTCY OR FINANCIAL DISTRESS

02:01:02.588 --> 02:01:05.391
DISTRESS OR LOSE THEIR HOMES OR

02:01:05.458 --> 02:01:06.993
FOR WHATEVER REASON THE SYSTEM

02:01:07.059 --> 02:01:10.262
CREATES -- THE CAUSE OF AN

02:01:10.329 --> 02:01:12.398
EQUITY THESE OFFICERS ARE ARE

02:01:12.465 --> 02:01:14.367
ARE ARE DEALING WITH FINANCIAL

02:01:14.433 --> 02:01:15.768
HARDSHIP.

02:01:15.835 --> 02:01:18.437
IN A SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY CAN.

02:01:18.504 --> 02:01:19.572
CAN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER FOR A

02:07:57.236 --> 02:07:58.637
GEOGRAPHY AND INDUSTRY AND IT'S

02:07:58.704 --> 02:07:59.271
GOING VERY WELL WE'RE GETTNG A

02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:00.472
LOT OF GOOD.

02:08:00.539 --> 02:08:02.808
GOOD FEEDBACK SO FAR SO YOU KNOW

02:08:02.875 --> 02:08:03.442
REALLY THE THE MAIN REASON CAL

02:08:03.509 --> 02:08:04.576
SAVERS WAS ESTABLISHED IS

02:08:04.643 --> 02:08:06.578
BECAUSE AT NEARLY HALF OF

02:08:06.645 --> 02:08:07.980
WORKING CALIFORNIANS ARE ON A

02:08:08.047 --> 02:08:09.348
TRAJECTORY TO RETIRE AND

02:08:09.415 --> 02:08:10.516
ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.

02:08:10.582 --> 02:08:11.450
AND WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE MAIN

02:08:11.517 --> 02:08:13.052
DRIVERS OF THAT IS THAT SEVEN

02:08:13.118 --> 02:08:14.620
AND A HALF MILLION HARD WORKING

02:08:14.686 --> 02:08:16.055
CALIFORNIANS WHO FOLLOW THE

02:08:16.121 --> 02:08:17.156
RULES EVERY DAY AND GO TO WORK.

02:08:17.222 --> 02:08:18.924
DON'T HAVE A WAY AN EASY WAY TO

02:08:18.991 --> 02:08:19.958
SAVE AT WORK THROUGH THEIR

02:08:20.025 --> 02:08:22.795
PAYROLL -- AND WE KNOW THAT FROM

02:08:22.861 --> 02:08:24.663
RESEARCH THAT PEOPLE ARE TWENTY

02:08:24.730 --> 02:08:26.398
TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SAVE FOR

02:08:26.465 --> 02:08:28.333
RETIREMENT IF THEY HAVE AN

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:29.935
AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT PAYROLL

02:08:30.002 --> 02:08:31.270
DEDUCTION FORM OF SAVINGS.

02:08:31.336 --> 02:08:32.337
SO REALLY THAT WAS THE MAIN

02:08:32.404 --> 02:08:34.840
PREMISE OF SENATE BILL ONE TWO

02:08:34.907 --> 02:08:36.141
THREE FOUR AND TWENTY SIXTEEN

02:08:36.208 --> 02:08:38.177
WHEN THE LEGISLATURE REALLY --

02:08:38.243 --> 02:08:39.845
TOOK BOLD INITIATIVE -- TO

02:08:39.912 --> 02:08:41.280
IMPROVE RETIREMENT SAVINGS AND

02:08:41.346 --> 02:08:42.681
RETIREMENT SECURITY FOR FOR

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:48.987
WORKING CALIFORNIANS -- YOU KNOW

02:08:49.054 --> 02:08:49.822
THE MAIN THE MAIN FEATURE OF THE

02:08:49.888 --> 02:08:51.323
PROGRAM REALLY IS THAT AUTOMATIC

02:08:51.390 --> 02:08:51.990
ENROLMENT FEATURE -- TO BE CLEAR

02:08:52.057 --> 02:08:52.758
PARTICIPATION IS COMPLETELY

02:08:52.825 --> 02:08:53.792
VOLUNTARY FOR EMPLOYEES THEY CAN

02:08:53.859 --> 02:08:55.727
OPT OUT AT ANY TIME -- GET BACK

02:08:55.794 --> 02:08:56.528
IN AND YOU KNOW THAT

02:08:56.595 --> 02:08:58.130
PARTICIPATION IS ABSOLUTELY

02:08:58.197 --> 02:08:59.698
VOLUNTARY NOT TO THEM THEY CAN.

02:08:59.765 --> 02:09:00.632
THAT WITHDRAW THEIR

02:09:00.699 --> 02:09:02.267
CONTRIBUTIONS TAX AND PENALTY

02:09:02.334 --> 02:09:03.469
FREE IF THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND

02:09:03.535 --> 02:09:05.104
IN THE FUTURE THE REMOVAL OF

02:09:05.170 --> 02:09:07.239
THAT AUTOMATIC ENROLMENT FEATURE

02:09:07.306 --> 02:09:11.743
WOULD IN AND REPLACE IT FIND

02:09:11.810 --> 02:09:13.312
THAT WOULD REALLY REALLY

02:09:13.378 --> 02:09:14.813
UNDERMINE THE THE WITH THE

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:15.781
INTENTION THE GOALS OF THE

02:09:15.848 --> 02:09:16.381
PROGRAM.

02:09:16.448 --> 02:09:18.083
AND WOULD REDUCE OVERALL

02:09:18.150 --> 02:09:19.618
RETIREMENT PREPAREDNESS ACROSS

02:09:19.685 --> 02:09:21.587
THE STATE AND IT WOULD IT WOULD

02:09:21.653 --> 02:09:22.988
THREATEN THE PROGRAM'S LIABILITY

02:09:23.055 --> 02:09:25.257
AS WELL -- RESEARCH HAS SHOWN

02:09:25.324 --> 02:09:26.959
THAT AUTOMATIC IN RALEIGH

02:09:27.025 --> 02:09:28.694
ENROLLMENT -- DRAMATICALLY

02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:30.195
INCREASES PARTICIPATION AND

02:09:30.262 --> 02:09:31.396
RETIREMENT SECURITY THE BASED

02:09:31.463 --> 02:09:32.998
SOLELY ON THE CAL SAVERS PORTION

02:09:33.065 --> 02:09:36.235
OF THE PROPOSAL I TREASURE MY

WITH YOUR SUPPORT AT YOUR I'D

02:09:42.307 --> 02:09:43.475
LIKE TO BE ABLE TO COMMENT

02:09:43.542 --> 02:09:44.443
SPECIFICALLY ON THE BILL'S

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:46.812
IMPACT IN REGARD TO CAL STARS.

02:09:46.879 --> 02:09:48.180
AS THAT HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED

02:09:48.247 --> 02:09:49.181
I'M JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE

02:09:49.248 --> 02:09:51.550
CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION

02:09:51.617 --> 02:09:53.418
AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DO AS WELL

02:09:53.485 --> 02:09:54.953
OPPOSE THIS MEASURE UP FOR A

02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:56.188
MULTITUDE OF REASONS BUT I'D

02:09:56.255 --> 02:09:57.689
LIKE TO SPECIFICALLY COMMENT ON

02:09:57.756 --> 02:09:58.924
CAL STIRS.

02:09:58.991 --> 02:10:00.292
WE DO APPRECIATE THE CENTER'S

02:10:00.359 --> 02:10:01.393
ATTEMPT TO TRY TO PROVIDE

02:10:01.460 --> 02:10:02.895
ADDITIONAL FUNDING BUT WE

02:10:02.961 --> 02:10:04.463
ACTUALLY DOING.

02:10:04.530 --> 02:10:05.397
IN FACT SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:10:05.464 --> 02:10:07.065
PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

02:10:07.132 --> 02:10:08.500
FUNDING FOR CAL STIRS THROUGH

02:10:08.567 --> 02:10:10.602
THE BUDGET BY PROVIDING POP TO

02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:12.538
FUND SPECIFICALLY TO DISTRICTS

02:10:12.604 --> 02:10:13.438
IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM --

02:10:13.505 --> 02:10:15.174
SEPARATE RELIEF BUT ADDITIONALLY

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:16.508
TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT ON

02:10:16.575 --> 02:10:18.343
BEHALF OF DISTRICTS AND WE ALSO

02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:20.345
SUPPORT HIS PROPOSAL. TO ALSO

02:10:20.412 --> 02:10:21.747
PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENT ON

02:10:21.813 --> 02:10:23.282
BEHALF OF THE STATE WE BELIEVE

02:10:23.348 --> 02:10:24.883
THAT THAT'S A VERY PRUDENT WAY

02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:25.717
FOR THE STATE TO SHOW ITS

02:10:25.784 --> 02:10:28.220
SUPPORT OF FULLY FUNDING CASTERS.

02:10:28.287 --> 02:10:30.088
BUT WE ALSO DO OPPOSE IT WHAT WE

02:10:30.155 --> 02:10:32.257
BELIEVE IS A MANIPULATION OF CAL

02:10:32.324 --> 02:10:33.358
STIRS A CIVIL TO MEET

02:10:33.425 --> 02:10:35.060
LIABILITIES BY USING A

02:10:35.127 --> 02:10:37.095
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RATE -- I

02:10:37.162 --> 02:10:38.597
RETURNED THAT CAL STIRS WOULD BE

02:10:38.664 --> 02:10:40.699
USING THAT DOES NOT REFLECT THE

02:10:40.766 --> 02:10:42.467
DIVERSITY OF THEIR INVESTMENTS

02:10:42.534 --> 02:10:44.469
ARE THEIR ASSET ALLOCATIONS WE

02:10:44.536 --> 02:10:45.537
BELIEVE THAT THE EXPERT TO

02:10:45.604 --> 02:10:47.239
CASTERS WHO ARE EXTREMELY

02:10:47.306 --> 02:10:48.507
TRANSPARENT IN HOW THEY SHOW

02:10:48.574 --> 02:10:49.775
THOSE NUMBERS.

02:10:49.841 --> 02:10:51.410
AND THEY ACTUALLY USE VARIOUS

02:10:51.476 --> 02:10:53.712
METHODOLOGIES THAT GAS BE IS

02:10:53.779 --> 02:10:54.980
REQUIRED TO ACTUALLY SHOW

02:10:55.047 --> 02:10:57.015
VARIOUS SCENARIOS SIMILAR TO

02:10:57.082 --> 02:10:58.417
WHAT THE CENTERS PROPOSED BUT

02:10:58.483 --> 02:10:59.818
THEY'VE ALSO NOTED THAT THOSE

02:10:59.885 --> 02:11:01.253
DON'T REFLECT THE PRACTICAL

02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:02.821
REALITY OF THE INVESTMENTS AND

02:11:02.888 --> 02:11:04.256
MORE IMPORTANTLY THE INVESTMENT

02:11:04.323 --> 02:11:06.191
RETURNS THAT CAL STIRS RECEIVES.

02:11:06.258 --> 02:11:07.693
SO IF YOU WE WERE TO USE THESE

02:11:07.759 --> 02:11:09.928
ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED NUMBERS IT

02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:11.330
WOULD ESSENTIALLY MORE THAN

02:11:11.396 --> 02:11:13.665
DOUBLE -- THAT SHORTFALL SAID

02:11:13.732 --> 02:11:14.967
THEY HAVE WHICH REALLY LEADS

02:11:15.033 --> 02:11:17.135
BEDS THE QUESTION OF IS THIS A

02:11:17.202 --> 02:11:19.304
WAY TO TRY TO DESTABILIZE

02:11:19.371 --> 02:11:20.906
PROVIDING DEFINED BENEFIT

02:11:20.973 --> 02:11:22.407
PENSIONS FOR CALIFORNIA'S

02:11:22.474 --> 02:11:23.976
TEACHERS AND OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR

02:11:24.042 --> 02:11:25.677
EMPLOYEES WE BELIEVE THAT THESE

02:11:25.744 --> 02:11:32.651
ARE VERY IMPORTANT MECHANISM. TO

02:11:32.718 --> 02:11:34.720
IN SURE THAT WE CAN RETAIN

02:11:34.786 --> 02:11:35.454
TEACHERS IN OUR CLASSROOMS SO

02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:36.255
THEREFORE WE OPPOSE THE MEASURE

THERE ARE CAL STIRS.

02:13:51.923 --> 02:13:53.959
AND WHEN THEY SAY THEY'LL BE.

02:13:54.025 --> 02:13:55.260
ACHIEVING THEIR FULL FUNDING AND

02:13:55.327 --> 02:13:56.361
THIRTY TWO YEARS FROM NOW WHICH

02:13:56.428 --> 02:13:57.529
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE.

02:13:57.596 --> 02:14:00.098
AND UP UNTIL NOW -- IT HAS BEEN

02:14:00.165 --> 02:14:01.466
AROUND VERY WELL I MEAN.

02:14:01.533 --> 02:14:02.734
YOU KNOW THERE'S DIFFERENT THINK

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:04.536
TANKS OUT THERE THAT SAYS THEIR

02:14:04.603 --> 02:14:07.339
X. AMOUNT AND DEBT -- ANOTHER

02:14:07.406 --> 02:14:08.473
ONE I THINK IT WAS A THINK TANK

02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:09.808
FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BOSTON

02:14:09.875 --> 02:14:10.976
SAID IF YOU DID ACCOUNTING

02:14:11.042 --> 02:14:12.210
PROCEDURES LIKE YOU'RE REALLY

02:14:12.277 --> 02:14:13.378
SUPPOSED TO THEIR OVER A

02:14:13.445 --> 02:14:14.980
TRILLION IN DEBT SO.

02:14:15.046 --> 02:14:16.715
THOSE THINGS CONCERNED ME YOU

02:14:16.782 --> 02:14:18.583
KNOW A AT IN MY JOB AS I WANT TO

02:14:18.650 --> 02:14:20.352
PROTECT OVER THE SERVICE AND

02:14:20.419 --> 02:14:20.986
SOME OF THE COMMENTS BACK THERE

02:14:21.052 --> 02:14:22.687
WERE KIND OF RIDICULOUS THAT I

02:14:22.754 --> 02:14:24.289
WANT TO TAKE SAVINGS AWAY FROM

02:14:24.356 --> 02:14:24.823
PEOPLE.

02:14:24.890 --> 02:14:26.725
I'M JUST SAYING THEY NEED TO

02:14:26.792 --> 02:14:28.527
HAVE AN OPT IN NATION IS IT'S

02:14:28.593 --> 02:14:29.594
EASIER OFTEN AND IS OPT OUT

02:14:29.661 --> 02:14:31.329
THROUGH THAT SYSTEM SO NO ONE

02:14:31.396 --> 02:14:32.798
WANTS TAKE THEM AWAY.

02:14:32.864 --> 02:14:34.199
OR THE WORD DIGNITY IS BACK

02:14:34.266 --> 02:14:35.567
THERE THAT'S WHY I'M HERE IS

02:14:35.634 --> 02:14:37.736
STRICTLY TRYING TO PROTECT OVER

02:14:37.803 --> 02:14:40.338
THIS BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THE WAY --

02:14:40.405 --> 02:14:41.907
THEIR MONEY HAS BEEN MANAGE YOU

02:14:41.973 --> 02:14:43.742
TALK ABOUT THE ONE THAT TEN YEAR

02:14:43.809 --> 02:14:45.677
TREASURY THE REASON THAT IS A

02:14:45.744 --> 02:14:47.412
GOOD ONE OUT SMALLS ONE OF THE

02:14:47.479 --> 02:14:49.214
MOST STABLE ONES THAT'S THE ONE

02:14:49.281 --> 02:14:51.249
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ONCE THE

02:14:51.316 --> 02:14:52.784
PRIVATE COMPANIES TO USE BECAUSE

02:14:52.851 --> 02:14:54.085
IT SEEMS TO BE.

02:14:54.152 --> 02:14:55.854
THE MOST LEVEL SO EVERYTHING

02:14:55.921 --> 02:14:57.989
I'VE DONE HERE IS IS IS TRY TO

02:14:58.056 --> 02:15:00.158
PLACE LAYERS OF PROTECTION --

02:15:00.225 --> 02:15:01.960
FOR OUR POLICE AND OUR FIRE --

02:15:02.027 --> 02:15:04.162
BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW IT IT'S IT'S

02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:05.897
FUNNY BECAUSE I REMEMBER

02:15:05.964 --> 02:15:07.132
SPEAKING TO SOMEONE I BELIEVE IT

02:15:07.199 --> 02:15:08.733
WAS SOME CALPERS COULD HAVE BEEN

02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:10.235
CAL STIRS A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

02:15:10.302 --> 02:15:11.636
AND THEY SAID THEY'RE CONFIDENT

02:15:11.703 --> 02:15:13.472
WITHIN THIRTY YEARS OF THE FULLY

02:15:13.538 --> 02:15:14.773
FUNDED AND I SAID WELL ONCE

02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:15.640
MAJORITY ARE PEOPLE GOING TO

02:15:15.707 --> 02:15:18.677
RETIRE THEY SAID THE NEXT EIGHT

02:15:18.743 --> 02:15:19.311
TO TEN YEARS I SAID HOW YOU CAN

02:15:19.377 --> 02:15:20.745
BE DOING THAT.

02:15:20.812 --> 02:15:22.347
THEY'RE NOT SO -- IF I REMEMBER

02:15:22.414 --> 02:15:23.849
IT AT DINNER ONE NIGHT I THINK

02:15:23.915 --> 02:15:24.916
YOU WERE THERE.

02:15:24.983 --> 02:15:27.252
TO GOVERNOR BROWN IF I REMEMBER

02:15:27.319 --> 02:15:28.820
HIS COMMENTS CORRECTLY -- HE

02:15:28.887 --> 02:15:30.422
SAID FOR THOSE OF US WHO MAY BE

02:15:30.489 --> 02:15:31.823
HERE IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS

02:15:31.890 --> 02:15:33.191
WHEN THAT NEXT BIG RECESSION

02:15:33.258 --> 02:15:36.027
COMES HE SAID AND AGAIN I I

02:15:36.094 --> 02:15:37.662
THINK THIS IS HIGHER RECALL IT.

02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:38.830
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE UP

02:15:38.897 --> 02:15:40.966
PENSION SALAMI SO THAT'S ALL

02:15:41.032 --> 02:15:50.375
LOOK AT PHAM -- IF THEY DON'T

02:15:50.442 --> 02:15:52.277
WANT TO BE PROTECTED THAT SAW.

02:15:52.344 --> 02:15:53.311
ENOUGH NO SWEAT OFF FOR ME I

02:15:53.378 --> 02:15:54.279
JUST I'M DOING THIS FOR THE

02:15:54.346 --> 02:15:56.214
PLEASED TO WORK.

02:15:56.281 --> 02:15:56.748
FOR A LIVING BECAUSE I AM

02:15:56.815 --> 02:15:57.616
CONCERNED LOOKING AT THEIR

02:15:57.682 --> 02:15:58.383
FUTURE PENSIONS.

02:15:58.450 --> 02:15:59.484
THAT'S MY WHOLE REASON AND

02:15:59.551 --> 02:16:00.085
MOTIVATION FOR THE BILL NOT TO

02:16:00.151 --> 02:16:02.153
TRY.

02:16:02.220 --> 02:16:03.922
TO BROCK ANYBODY'S ABOUT.

02:16:03.989 --> 02:16:04.523
THANK YOU CENTER WERE OF THE

02:16:04.589 --> 02:16:06.124
SENATOR PAN QUESTION.

02:16:06.191 --> 02:16:07.325
KAMALA JUST STAY AT THE BRIEF

02:16:07.392 --> 02:16:10.362
COMMENT AND YOU KNOW APPRECIATE

02:16:10.428 --> 02:16:12.397
US THAT -- SEVERAL SENTIMENTS

02:16:12.464 --> 02:16:13.398
YEAH WE WORKED TOGETHER ON THE

02:16:13.465 --> 02:16:16.268
PURSE COMMITTEE AND FRAZIER -- I

02:16:16.334 --> 02:16:19.838
WOULD MAKE NOTE TO THAT -- BOTH --

02:16:19.905 --> 02:16:22.307
PENSION FUNDS -- FIELD DAY DAY

02:16:22.374 --> 02:16:25.710
MADE THEY MADE HARD DECISIONS --

02:16:25.777 --> 02:16:26.645
FOR TO BE SURE THAT -- THE

02:16:26.711 --> 02:16:29.614
RETURNS WERE ACTUALLY REFLECT --

02:16:29.681 --> 02:16:31.283
THEIR PROTECT THEIR PROJECTIONS

02:16:31.349 --> 02:16:33.685
REFLECT THE ACTUAL RETURNS -- WE

02:16:33.752 --> 02:16:35.387
LOWERED THE DISCOUNT RATE FROM

02:16:35.453 --> 02:16:37.188
SEVEN POINT.

02:16:37.255 --> 02:16:43.461
527% -- THAT MEANT THAT.

02:16:43.528 --> 02:16:44.596
SCHOOL DISTRICTS LOCALITIES HAD

02:16:44.663 --> 02:16:46.565
TO INCREASE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS.

02:16:46.631 --> 02:16:47.198
I WOULD MAKE NOTE AND CERTAINLY

02:16:47.265 --> 02:16:49.401
THIS IS NOT THE BEST COMPARISON

02:16:49.467 --> 02:16:51.703
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STAND --

02:16:51.770 --> 02:16:53.738
FOR INDEX -- IF YOU GO ALL THE

02:16:53.805 --> 02:16:54.606
WAY BACK.

02:16:54.673 --> 02:16:55.907
EVEN IF YOU INCLUDE THE GREAT

02:16:55.974 --> 02:17:00.579
DEPRESSION -- AND AGAIN WE DON'T.

02:17:00.645 --> 02:17:01.880
BUT ALL OUR MONEY INTO EQUITIES --

02:17:01.947 --> 02:17:04.916
AND INTO THE SB FIVE HUNDRED BUT

02:17:04.983 --> 02:17:07.352
THAT RETURN HAS -- IS --

02:17:07.419 --> 02:17:10.889
GENERALLY DAN ABOUT -- NOW 9% SO

02:17:10.956 --> 02:17:12.357
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A MIX RIGHT

02:17:12.424 --> 02:17:15.660
AND AND DID YOU WANT TO DO THE

02:17:15.727 --> 02:17:16.795
RIGHT ASSET ALLOCATION SO FORTH.

02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:19.297
SO I I DO THINK THAT USING AT

02:17:19.364 --> 02:17:21.099
TEN YEAR TREASURY RATE IS IS.

02:17:21.166 --> 02:17:25.704
IS IS A BIT LOW AND NOT THE MOST.

02:17:25.770 --> 02:17:27.272
ACTOR WAY OF DOING IT BUT

02:17:27.339 --> 02:17:28.306
CERTAINLY YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT

02:17:28.373 --> 02:17:29.407
THIS IS A JUDGMENT TERMS IF.

02:17:29.474 --> 02:17:31.209
YOU COULD GO FOR VERY LOW RETURN

02:17:31.276 --> 02:17:32.677
AND SAY THAT WE HAVE TO JACK UP

02:17:32.744 --> 02:17:34.179
CONTRIBUTIONS TO KEEP OUR

02:17:34.245 --> 02:17:35.714
PROMISES BUT I I WOULD HOPE THAT

02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:36.214
WE WOULD.

02:17:36.281 --> 02:17:39.117
SEEK TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S MORE

02:17:39.184 --> 02:17:43.154
REFLECTIVE OF OF WHAT WITH.

02:17:43.221 --> 02:17:43.722
THAT THE MARKETS REALLY ARE

02:17:43.788 --> 02:17:45.056
BEHAVING.

02:17:45.123 --> 02:17:46.591
AND THE OTHER I THINK THE OTHER

02:17:46.658 --> 02:17:47.192
RIGHT AWAY REQUEST THAT WE'RE

02:17:47.259 --> 02:17:47.726
NOT.

02:17:47.792 --> 02:17:48.960
MANDATING A USED OUT AND WE'RE

02:17:49.027 --> 02:17:50.095
JUST SAYING IT'S A GOOD GUY TO

02:17:50.161 --> 02:17:51.896
GO WELL I I I WOULD I GUESS I

02:17:51.963 --> 02:17:52.397
WOULD.

02:17:52.464 --> 02:17:54.332
BEG TO DIFFER SO THAT'S THAT'S

02:17:54.399 --> 02:17:55.333
WHAT I'M SAYING.

02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:57.268
AND ALSO I I WOULD SAY IS THAT

02:17:57.335 --> 02:18:00.639
THE RESEARCH ON ON RETIREMENT --

02:18:00.705 --> 02:18:01.940
TERMS OPT IN OPT OUT FOR CAL

02:18:02.007 --> 02:18:03.908

IN TERMS OF HAVING AN OPT IN --

02:18:07.912 --> 02:18:09.848
ATION OPT OUT IS -- GOING TO

HAVE A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF

02:18:10.982 --> 02:18:13.518
PARTICIPATION AND ACTUALLY IF

EVERY FINANCIAL ADVICE THING

02:18:28.833 --> 02:18:30.201
I'VE SEEN HAS AS THE DOW THAT'S

02:18:30.268 --> 02:18:31.636
CREDIBLE AS SAID THAT THE AND

02:18:31.703 --> 02:18:33.004

AT LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS -- I

02:19:46.611 --> 02:19:47.545
THINK THEY'RE IN.

02:19:47.612 --> 02:19:49.247
SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE

02:19:49.314 --> 02:19:50.915

TO MAKE A CRYSTAL CLEAR --

02:23:53.691 --> 02:23:55.193
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO

TO RETURN TO WORK BECAUSE I HAVE

02:24:45.777 --> 02:24:47.178

02:24:47.245 --> 02:24:48.046
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO USE

02:24:48.112 --> 02:24:53.217

AND NOT IDEAL IN TERMS OF HAVING --

02:24:55.253 --> 02:24:57.355

THIS BILL SETS -- BASIC

02:24:58.423 --> 02:25:00.825
ACHIEVABLE STANDARDS -- IT --

02:25:00.892 --> 02:25:02.527

SINK WITH RUNNING WATER CLOSE BY

02:25:18.342 --> 02:25:19.944
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACTLY IN

02:25:20.011 --> 02:25:21.079
THAT ROOM BUT IT HAS TO BE

02:25:21.145 --> 02:25:25.650

IT COULD BE A MULTI PURPOSE ROOM --

02:25:32.056 --> 02:25:33.224
AS LONG AS EXPRESSING BREAST

02:25:33.291 --> 02:25:34.859
MILK IS AN ACTIVITY THAT TAKES

02:25:34.926 --> 02:25:36.027
PRIORITY THERE.

02:26:06.257 --> 02:26:07.592
THAN OFFICE SETTING.

02:26:07.658 --> 02:26:10.561
WE WORKED ON A SPECIAL APPROACH

02:26:10.628 --> 02:26:12.096
FOR THE AGRICULTURAL.

02:26:12.163 --> 02:26:15.199

02:33:51.989 --> 02:33:53.090
PENALTIES UNDER THE PRIVATE

02:33:53.157 --> 02:33:54.625
ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT AND THIS

02:33:54.692 --> 02:33:56.193
BECOMES ASTRONOMICAL FOR

02:33:56.260 --> 02:33:57.761
EMPLOYERS TO HAVE TO PAY MAKE

02:33:57.828 --> 02:33:58.762
THESE PAYOUTS.

02:33:58.829 --> 02:34:01.165
SO ESSENTIALLY IN IN OUR VIEW

02:34:01.231 --> 02:34:02.967
IT'S A DUPLICATE PENALTY EVEN

02:34:03.033 --> 02:34:04.168
THOUGH THE COURT SEE IT AS AN

02:34:04.234 --> 02:34:05.836
ADDITIONAL WAGE FOR THE EMPLOYEE

02:34:05.903 --> 02:34:07.304
AND THAT TWO TWO SIX IS STILL

02:34:07.371 --> 02:34:09.273
PART OF THE TWO TWO SIX

02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:10.908
VIOLATION IS STILL PART OF THIS.

02:34:10.975 --> 02:34:12.810
BILL ADDITIONALLY THE BUILDING

02:34:12.876 --> 02:34:14.078
CODE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE

02:34:14.144 --> 02:34:15.713
TAKEN OUT LAST YEAR THAT ARE

02:34:15.779 --> 02:34:17.381
BACK IN -- WILL APPROXIMATELY

02:34:17.448 --> 02:34:20.551
COST EMPLOYERS THIRTY THOUSAND

02:34:20.618 --> 02:34:21.251
TWO HUNDRED ANDFIVE THOUSAND

02:34:21.318 --> 02:34:23.921
AND EXISTING BUILDING AND

02:34:23.988 --> 02:34:25.656
500-021-4000 PER YEAR IN ANNUAL

02:34:25.723 --> 02:34:26.991
MAINTENANCE ON THAT SPACE OR

02:34:27.057 --> 02:34:28.492
LOSS OF SPACE IT CAN'T BE USED

02:34:28.559 --> 02:34:29.360
FOR OTHER ISSUES.

02:34:29.426 --> 02:34:34.832
AND THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE

02:34:34.898 --> 02:34:35.899
IDEA THAT NOT A EVERY -- OFFICE

02:34:35.966 --> 02:34:37.067
NOT EVERY BUILDING IS GOING TO

02:34:37.134 --> 02:34:37.668
HAVE A WOMAN THAT MIGHT NEED

02:34:37.735 --> 02:34:38.335
THAT SPACES A LACTATION

02:34:38.402 --> 02:34:38.936
ACCOMMODATION -- ADDITIONALLY

02:34:39.003 --> 02:34:39.536
THEY'RE GOING TO BE TECHNICAL

02:34:39.603 --> 02:34:40.638
ISSUES THE AUTOMATICALLY SET

02:34:40.704 --> 02:34:42.506
EMPLOYERS UP TO FAILURE -- I

02:34:42.573 --> 02:34:43.474
KNOW SOME OF THOSE WERE TAKEN

02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:44.975
TODAY BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I DO

02:34:45.042 --> 02:34:46.143
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THE

02:34:46.210 --> 02:34:49.546
SPACE IF IT'S UTILIZED BY A IS A

02:34:49.613 --> 02:34:51.181
COMMON AREA UTILIZED.

02:34:51.248 --> 02:34:54.418
THE AND AS SUCH AS A BREAK ROOM

02:34:54.485 --> 02:34:56.020
IT HAS TO TAKE PRIORITY BUT

02:34:56.086 --> 02:34:57.421
EMPLOYERS HAVE TO PROVIDE BREAK

02:34:57.488 --> 02:34:59.456
ROOM -- AND PLACES FOR EMPLOYEES

02:34:59.523 --> 02:35:00.424
TO TAKE THEIR BREAKS SO THE

02:35:00.491 --> 02:35:01.892
EMPLOYER WOULD POTENTIALLY BE IN

02:35:01.959 --> 02:35:04.428
VIOLATION OF THE BILL IF THEY

02:35:04.495 --> 02:35:05.929
HAVE A LOCKED IN WITH MY MOTHER

02:35:05.996 --> 02:35:07.164
THAT NEEDS TO UTILIZE THE BREAK

02:35:07.231 --> 02:35:08.699
FROM FOR LACTATION PURPOSES BUT

02:35:08.766 --> 02:35:10.067
THEN ALSO HAS EMPLOYEES THAT YOU

02:35:10.134 --> 02:35:11.602
NEED TO UTILIZE THAT SAME SPACE.

02:35:11.669 --> 02:35:13.037
FOR BREAKS SO FEW OF THOSE

02:35:13.103 --> 02:35:14.405
ISSUES ARE THE REASONS WHY WE

02:35:14.471 --> 02:35:15.739
ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AND WE

02:35:15.806 --> 02:35:17.508
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY BUT

02:35:17.574 --> 02:35:19.276

AND TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION

02:35:59.950 --> 02:36:01.218
IN THE BROADER DISCUSSIONS

02:36:01.285 --> 02:36:02.853
ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE

02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:03.754

MISS CURTIS DID SPECIFIED

02:36:45.295 --> 02:36:46.296
BECAUSE IT IS AN AMENDMENT IN

02:36:46.363 --> 02:36:47.798
THE LABOR CODE IT IS SUBJECT TO

02:36:47.865 --> 02:36:50.367
PAGO SO. ONE WAS TAKEN BUT ONE

02:36:52.069 --> 02:36:53.403
TERMS OF PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT.

02:36:53.470 --> 02:36:54.638
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ON THE TOP

02:36:54.705 --> 02:36:56.039
OF PAGE FOUR THERE'S A

02:36:56.106 --> 02:36:57.775
DISCUSSION ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS

02:36:57.841 --> 02:37:00.410
AND THE UNDUE HARDSHIP EXEMPTION --

02:37:00.477 --> 02:37:01.411
AS SENATOR WIENER KNOWS FROM

02:37:01.478 --> 02:37:03.447
LAST YEAR WE WOULD ADVOCATE FOR

02:37:03.514 --> 02:37:05.582
THAT TO BE APPLICABLE ACROSS THE

02:37:05.649 --> 02:37:07.985
BOARD NO ISSUE IF FOR EXAMPLE

02:37:08.051 --> 02:37:09.887
THIS STATE THE RELEVANT STATE

02:37:09.953 --> 02:37:10.554
AGENCY.

02:37:10.621 --> 02:37:12.289
OR TO CERTIFY THAT IN OTHER

02:37:12.356 --> 02:37:13.891
WORDS THAT THE EMPLOYER WOULD

02:37:13.957 --> 02:37:15.659
HAVE TO GO AND PETITION. FOR

02:37:15.726 --> 02:37:17.628
THAT UNDE HARDSHIP EXEMPTION

02:37:17.694 --> 02:37:18.695
RATHER THAN SIMPLY CLAIM IT BY

02:37:18.762 --> 02:37:20.264
THEMSELVES BUT WE BELIEVE IT

02:37:20.330 --> 02:37:21.799
SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL

02:37:21.865 --> 02:37:23.600

FOR YES SENATOR PAN.

02:37:34.912 --> 02:37:36.013
THANK YOU SIR WIENER FOR RAIN

02:37:36.079 --> 02:37:37.014
THIS BILL FOR CERTAINLY WE WANNA

02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:38.348
TRY TO ENCOURAGE -- BREAST

02:37:38.415 --> 02:37:39.817
FEEDING AND I THINK THE

02:37:39.883 --> 02:37:41.652
CONNECTION WITH -- PARENTAL

02:37:41.718 --> 02:37:45.489
LEAVE IS THAT IDEALLY THAT --

02:37:45.556 --> 02:37:46.890
THE PARENT WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK

02:37:46.957 --> 02:37:48.258
TO WORK TOO EARLY BUT SAME TIME

02:37:48.325 --> 02:37:49.493
SINCE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PROMOTE

02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:50.961
BREAST FEEDING FOR ABOUT A YEAR

02:37:51.028 --> 02:37:53.764
WE'RE NOT GIVING A YEAR'S WORTH

02:37:53.831 --> 02:37:54.264
OF PARENTAL LEAVE WITH.

02:37:54.331 --> 02:37:56.867
THE ON THE PARTITION SPACES.

02:37:56.934 --> 02:37:58.268
BUT ONE THING I DID WANT TO

02:37:58.335 --> 02:37:59.236
CLEAR FIVE BECAUSE OF THE SURE

02:37:59.303 --> 02:38:01.104
FROM THE ANALYSIS IS AND I THINK

02:38:01.171 --> 02:38:02.172
THIS ISSUE CAME UP THE LAST TIME

02:38:02.239 --> 02:38:03.841
YOU BROUGHT THIS BILL.

02:38:03.907 --> 02:38:05.676
FOR SO FOR AN EXISTING PLAYERS

02:38:05.742 --> 02:38:08.312
IN AN EXISTING BUILDING --

02:38:08.378 --> 02:38:09.379
BOMBINGS PRETTY EXPENSIVE TO

02:38:09.446 --> 02:38:11.348
BUILD SO THE QUESTION WAS IS

02:38:11.415 --> 02:38:12.583
THAT AND BUT IT'S AT THE SPACE

02:38:12.649 --> 02:38:14.484
THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH.

02:38:14.551 --> 02:38:15.819
THE STANDARDS WHICH WOULD ALSO

02:38:15.886 --> 02:38:17.154
INCLUDE PLENTY SO I KNOW A LOT

02:38:17.221 --> 02:38:18.322
OF OFFICES.

02:38:18.388 --> 02:38:19.656
THE ONLY PLACES THEY DO HAVE

02:38:19.723 --> 02:38:23.193
PLUMBING OUR BATHROOM.

02:38:23.260 --> 02:38:25.162
OR THEY MAY HAVE A KITCHEN OR

02:38:25.229 --> 02:38:27.164
SOME THING OF SOME SORT AND

02:38:27.231 --> 02:38:29.199
THAT'S THE BREAK ROOM ISSUE.

02:38:29.266 --> 02:38:30.667
AS A AND A AND THAT SIDE SO I

02:38:30.734 --> 02:38:32.035
CLARIFIED THAT.

02:38:32.102 --> 02:38:34.137
DO YOU NEED TO HAVE CLIMBING IN

02:38:34.204 --> 02:38:36.406
THE VERY ROOM THAT YOU'RE USING

02:38:36.473 --> 02:38:38.475
FOR LACTATION -- OR DO YOU JUST

02:38:38.542 --> 02:38:40.110
NEED A PLUMBING ACCESSIBLE BUT

02:38:40.177 --> 02:38:41.178
THEY DON'T NEED TO BE PHYSICALLY

02:38:41.245 --> 02:38:42.746
IN THE SAME SPACE BECAUSE I

02:38:42.813 --> 02:38:44.414
THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE

02:38:44.481 --> 02:38:45.382
CHALLENGE FOR MANY BUSINESS.

02:38:45.449 --> 02:38:48.118
BEFORE THE REFRIGERATION AND FOR

02:38:48.185 --> 02:38:50.053
THE RUNNING WATER IT DOES NOT

02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:52.022
HAVE TO BE IN THE SAME SPACE IT

02:38:52.089 --> 02:38:54.458
HAS TO BE ACCESSIBLE -- SO

02:38:54.524 --> 02:38:55.392
THAT'S AND I BELIEVE THAT'S

02:38:55.459 --> 02:38:56.894
EXPLICIT IN THERE THAT'S NOT

02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:59.029
HAVE TO BE WITH IN THE SAME ROOM --

02:38:59.096 --> 02:39:01.732
AND IN ADDITION -- THERE IS A

02:39:01.798 --> 02:39:03.333
THE SUBSECTION THE TALKS ABOUT

02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:05.502
OPERATIONAL -- FLEXIBILITY

02:39:05.569 --> 02:39:06.603
BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THERE

02:39:06.670 --> 02:39:08.472
COULD BE SOME SITUATIONS THAT

02:39:08.538 --> 02:39:10.073
ARE CHALLENGING FOR THAT'S OUR

02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:12.309
INTENT -- WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO

02:39:12.376 --> 02:39:14.544
MAKE THIS INCREDIBLY HARD TO

02:39:14.611 --> 02:39:16.947
COMPLY WITH WANT FLEXIBILITY AND

02:39:17.014 --> 02:39:18.282
IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE IN THE

02:39:18.348 --> 02:39:19.983
SAME OKAY ALL RIGHT IT WASN'T

02:39:20.050 --> 02:39:21.652
CLEAR FROM ANALYSIS I FIGHT IN

02:39:21.718 --> 02:39:29.259
DEL INTO THE BILL DETAILED

02:39:29.326 --> 02:39:29.826

AS WELL -- AND WE DID HEAR A

02:39:47.344 --> 02:39:49.546
