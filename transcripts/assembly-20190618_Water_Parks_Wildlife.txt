EIGHT FANTASTIC. WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS -- ISN'T AS MANY OF YOU REMEMBER I PRESENTED A SIMILAR BILL TO THIS COMMITTEE. WOULD BAN SMOKING AT STATE PARKS AND BEACHES THAT UNFORTUNATELY AFTER PASSING THE LEGISLATURE BY A WIDE MARGIN. THE BILL WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN FOR A SECOND TIME. SO I'M I'M HOPING THAT TO THE THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM. I HAVE HAD THIS LEGISLATION. BUT THE SB EIGHT WOULD PROHIBITS POKING AT UNIT AT THE STATE PARK SYSTEM. AND MAKE IT INTO AN FOR INFRACTION PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF UP TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. THE SMOKING PROHIBITION CONTAINED IN THIS BILL WOULD BE ENFORCED ONLY AFTER SIGNS HAVE BEEN POSTED. THE BILL ALSO ALSO AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. TO DESIGNATE AREAS AS EXEMPT FROM THE SMOKING PROHIBITION. RECORDED THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION TOBACCO KILLS OVER FORTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS EVERY YEAR. SECONDS THOUSANDS MORE AND COST THE STATE MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT BILLION AND HEALTH CARE MEDICAID AND LOST PRODUCTIVITY. ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF SMOKING AND HEALTH CARE COSTS THE STATE ARE WELL KNOWN BUT SMOKING ALSO HARMS THE ENVIRONMENT IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS. CIGARETTE BUT THROUGH A MAJOR SOURCE OF WASTE AND LETTER. CIGARETTES ALSO BECAUSE WILD FIRES. ACCORDING TO CAL FIRE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIRES HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SMOKING FOUR HUNDRED FIRES CAUSED BY SMOKING SINCE. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN BANNING SMOKING AT STATE PARKS IS THE NEXT STEP IN ADDRESSING THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH SMOKING.

THERE'S AN OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE AT THE STATE PARKS OWNED ALAMEDA TEXAS PENSION AREA. ALSO REFERRED TO AS TUSSLE HAS WHERE ECOLOGICAL VALUE IN CONTAINS AN ABUNDANCE OF HIGHLY SENSITIVE NOT RESOURCES AND THERE'S A LONG ESTABLISHED BODY OF PEER REVIEWED STUDIES. THAT SHOW THE RECREATIONAL OFF OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE USE BECAUSE IT REPERTOIRE DAMAGES TO SOILS VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE. TESS WAS BIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE IS IRREFUTABLE ITS LOCATION AT THE INTERSECTION OF BIOTIC ZONES RESULT IN RARE BIODIVERSITY AND SERVED AS A SPECIES SAVING CORRIDORS EMBARK BUFFERS IN TIMES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. CALIFORNIA'S EARLIEST NATIONALIST INCLUDING JOSEPH GRINNELL AND JOHN YOUR FATHER THIS YEAR CLUB AND BOTHER THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM -- RECOGNIZE THE HIGH CONSERVATION VALUE OF THE AREA WHERE TEST WERE TESTED WAS SITUATED. AND TESLA HOLDS FORTY TWO SPECIAL STATUS WILDLIFE SPECIES INCLUDING EIGHT FEDERALLY OR STATE OWNED STATE LISTED IN CANDIDATES SPECIES THIRTEEN SPECIAL STATUS AND TWENTY EIGHT LOCALLY RARE PLANT SPECIES. AND SEVEN SENSITIVE VEGETATION COMMUNITIES. THE BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IS MATCHED BY SIGNIFICANT CULTURAL VALUES INCLUDING NEGATIVE CALIFORNIANS SITES OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SPIRITUAL AND CEREMONIAL IMPORTANCE.

SO I WANT TO MENTION SOME ITEMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ADDRESSED TODAY. AND I'LL PROBABLY DO THESE HOOPS MORALIST FAR FORM. SO -- THE FIRST ONE IS PRESERVATION OF THE ALAMEDA TESLA EXPANSION AREA IT'S A LOCAL PRIORITY. AND SB SEVEN SIX SEVEN IS A DISTRICT MEASURE. ALL OF THE ALAMEDA TESLA EXPANSE SUSPENSION AREA ALSO KNOWN AS TESSLER TESLA PARK. IS LOCATED IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. SB SEVEN SIX SEVEN DOES NOT ESTABLISH ANY STATEWIDE PRESIDENT IT ADDRESSES A SPECIFIC. LOCAL TWENTY YEAR CONTROVERSY THAT RECOGNIZES THE O. H. P. RECREATION CAN BE LOCATE FADED ALL SWEAR WHILE TESLA'S DIVERSE ECO SYSTEM. CANNOT BE MOVED. THERE'S OVERWHELMING LOCAL SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL AND THIS INCLUDES NOT JUST COMMUNITY GROUPS BUT ALSO LOCAL AGENCIES. SUCH AS THE ALAMEDA COUNTY OF ALAMEDA THE CITY OF LIVER.

TWO THOUSAND WHAT THAT WAS WHEN THE FIRST E. I. R. WAS COMPLETED. THERE WAS NO -- ACQUISITION THE I. R. PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE. SB TWO FORTY NINE DID NOT ADDRESS TESSLER PRESERVATION. SCIENCE CONFIRMS THAT OHB USES DAMAGING. CARNEGIE I THINK AS AS YOU ALREADY MENTIONED IN SOME DETAIL. KIND OF THE S. V. R. A. ATTENDANCE HAS DECREASED SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHILE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. THE EAST BAY AND THE STATE SURVEYS THE PUBLIC PRIORITY AND DEMAND IT'S FOR OPEN SPACE AND NATURE AREAS.

HI ASK UP FOLKS -- WISHING TO GIVE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. THIS CALL FOR STUFF YOU GUYS GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN TERRY MCHALE OVER THERE AND READ AND ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE COALITION OF OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE -- RECREATION STE. THIS THIS IS A CONTROVERSY THAT THE AUTHORS CRACK FOR TWENTY YEARS WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION. AND IT'S LIKELY THAT WE WILL DISCUSS IT FOR ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS WE DON'T DO SOMETHING. AND SO WHILE WE'RE VERY RESPECTFUL OF WHAT THE AUTHORS PROPOSED. WE OPPOSE IT FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON. WE BELIEVE LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE WE SPENT AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF TIME. WORKING ON A BILL THAT. UPDATED OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION THERE ARE EIGHT OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARKS WE HAVE MORE SCIENTISTS WORKING OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION IN THE OTHER. WE SPEND MORE TIME PROTECTING CULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES THAN ANY OTHER -- IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE IN TESLA WE HAVE SPENT MORE TIME THAN ANY OTHER MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS A LEGITIMATE PLACE FOR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION. HOWEVER THERE IS EXTRAORDINARY LOCAL OPPOSITION. AND IT WILL LIKELY CONTINUE. AND AS LONG AS MR GLAZERS IN THE LEGISLATURE AND AS LONG AS I'M ALIVE WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE A BILL LIKE THIS INTRODUCED UNTIL THERE IS RESOLUTION. OUR PROBLEM WITH THE BILL IS THAT THERE IS THE IDEA. THAT WE WILL HAVE A HEARING AND THAT THE STATE PARKS WILL CHANGE THEIR MIND. AND SUDDENLY TURN OVER THIS PLACE THAT IS SET ASIDE FOR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION AND TURN IT OVER TO THE LOCALS. MY BELIEF IS IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT HEARING. THEN THERE SHOULD ALSO BE A CONSEQUENCE FOR THOSE THAT MR GLAZER SENATOR GLAZER REPRESENTS. THE IDEA THAT WE DO THIS HEARING AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT PARKS IS DONE EVERYTHING THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. THEN WE QUICKLY. PUT IN THE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION ACTIVITY AS IT WAS PROPOSED TO DO THAT WE MOVE FORWARD. THAT WE NOT HAVE THIS HEARING IN THIS DISCUSSION EVERY SINGLE YEAR. BOB I'LL CLOSE BY SAYING I DO APPRECIATE SENATOR GLAZERS OFFICE IN HIM PERSONALLY. FOR HIS WILLINGNESS TO TALK TO US AND I ASKED FOR A NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. I'M ANY GRANTED ON BEHALF OF THE OFF ROAD VEHICLE LEGISLATIVE COALITION -- I AM JUST AN OFF ROADER. AND THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW THAT I FIND MYSELF IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO DEFEND. THE FORM OF RECREATION THAT I LOVE IS THIS. BILL IS TARGETED DIRECTLY AT ME AND BY EXTENSION THOSE THAT I REPRESENT. FRANKLY WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT WE'RE ALREADY. OF PROTECTING THE RESOURCE AND ALL THE MENTION OF THE PRISTINE NATURE IS BECAUSE ALL THE WORK THE PARK IS PUT INTO IT FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS [inaudible] BESIDES THAT. WE OWE IT SHOULD BE OUR DIVISION OF STATE PARKS ALREADY HAS THE HIGHEST LEGISLATIVE MANDATE HIGHER THAN ANY PRIVATE ENTITY HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER STATE PARK. TO PRESERVE NATURAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES WE ARE HOLD LITTER OF HELD LITERALLY TO A HIGHER AUTHORITY [inaudible] IN. SO IT'S WITH FRUSTRATION THAT WE ASK YOU TODAY -- TO FOR NO VOTE. WE DO AGREE WITH MR MCHALE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE. THAT ONCE STARTED ONCE THIS LITTLE TOLL HOLD IS ACHIEVED -- IT WILL GO AGAINST EXISTING PARK IT WILL THEN GO FURTHER DOWN THE STATE AND BEFORE WE KNOW WHAT WE WILL HAVE EVERY STATE PARK. EVERY THAT CATERS TO WHICH WE ARE CREATION TARGETED BECAUSE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO SPOKE IN FAVOR HAVE ALREADY DONE THAT. THEY HAVE ALREADY. TARGETED US BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE OUR FORM OF RECREATION -- IN REALITY WE'RE JUST SORT IN NORMAL PEOPLE WHO LIKE GOING OUT WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND HAVING A GOOD TIME [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN CAPPING LUNCH REPRESENTING THE OFFER REAL VEHICLE LEGISLATIVE COALITION AND I'M IN STRONG OPPOSITION THIS BILL FOR ALL THE REASONS STATED AND WE TO WORKED ON LEGISLATION -- WITH SENATOR ALLEN IN THIS COMMITTEE IN THE PAST YEAR THANK YOU.

NOTHING IN THIS LEGISLATION INTERFERES WITH THAT -- OVERALL POLICY FRAMEWORK THAT YOU APPROVED IN THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED. THIS BILL ONLY PROVIDES AN OPTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND REC ONLY AN OPTION. TO BE CLEAR WE HAVE AN OFF ROAD HIGHWAY VEHICLE PARKED RIGHT THERE NEXT DOOR THIS PROPERTY IT'S IN OUR DISTRICT. YEAH IT'S ACTIVELY USED ALTHOUGH. THE ACTIVITY HAS GONE DOWN. BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THAT MEANS TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THERE'S A PICTURE OF THE THE CARD HE PROPERTY AND TEN WHAT OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE USE DOES TO THE ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS A LOT OF IMPACTS OKAY. AND SO THAT'S EXISTING USE -- NEXT DOOR TO THIS PROPERTY. AND AND THIS IS THE A PICTURE OF THE PROPERTY THAT WE'RE TRYING. TO GIVE THE OPTION OPTION TO THE DEPARTMENT TO PRESERVE IF THEY CAN'T WORK OUT THERE OFF HIGHWAY EXPANSION IN THIS SPACE DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH THEIR EXPANSION pIT'S IN THE COURTS IS GOING TO BE THERE FOR A LONG TIME THEY'RE GONNA SPEND MILLIONS DEFENDING IT WE WANT TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT AN OPTION. THAT THEY SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH THEY CAN GET ALL THEIR MONEY BACK THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT NOT TO THE ANDS BE GIVEN AWAY THEY HAVE TO BE HAS TO BE SOLD. AND AT A MINIMUM THEY HAVE TO GET ALL THEIR MONEY BACK -- THAT CAN GO INTO THAT FINE FOR OTHER OFF HIGHWAY USE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE OR EVEN IN OUR AREA BUT THERE'S A PROCESS FOR THAT -- FINALLY I WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO THE MANY PEOPLE WHO TRAVELED HERE FROM FAR AND WIDE TO BE A PART OF THIS YEAR HEARING MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG -- BUT THERE IS A LOT OF PASSION LOCALLY THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

TO THE SANTA MONICA NATIONAL RECREATION AREA. IN MOST AIR QUALITY REPORTS LOS ANGELES CONTINUOUSLY RANKS AS ONE OF THE CITIES WITH THE WORST AIR QUALITY POOR AIR QUALITY IS PARTICULARLY FELT BY LOW INCOME ANGELINOS OF COLOR. THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT A PREDOMINANTLY LATINO DISTRICT THAT HAS SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY AND LA COUNTY. WHILE IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED THAT INCREASING GREEN SPACES DECREASES DECREASES POLLUTANTS IN THE AIR LOS ANGELES HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE SEVERELY DEFICIENT IN ACCESS TO THESE GREEN SPACES. OB SO BY SUPPORTING THIS THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WE'RE NOT ONLY PROTECTING OUR LANDSCAPES OF BUT ALSO -- YOU KNOW THE ABUNDANT FLORA AND FAUNA THAT THIS AREA THE RIM OF THE VALLEY CORRIDOR -- WILL ALSO PROTECT THESE LANDS -- FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS YOU KNOW THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR EYEBALLS THANK YOU ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. GOOD MORNING MR WARNER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. OKAY -- ANYONE ELSE SEEN. NO ONE ANYONE. WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. HOW ONE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS IS OUR MOTION? THE MOTION WAS GLORIA TAKEN BY MS GARCIA [inaudible] QUESTIONS PLEASE. JUST OUT OF JUST HAD A CONCERNED AND AND IT'S KIND OF BEEN A LITTLE THING I'VE BEEN CONTINUALLY BRINGING UP. OUR PARKS HAVE A TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS. AMOUNT OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND IS RECOGNIZED AT THE NATIONAL PARKS IN THIS CASE. THE CHAIR AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS AT LEAST FOR OUR STATE PARKS. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO STEP UP TO THE PLATEIS THIS AS THE STATE. SHOULD WITH ITS BUDGET. TO HELP THE ALL THOSE DEFERRED ACTIONS THE NATIONAL PARK IS ACTUALLY WAITING ON HIS ACTION AND IS STATED. THAT THEY OPPOSE IT. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TAKING ON MORE OF THE MAYOR OF THIS AND THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS JUST TREMENDOUS SO. HOW CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT ISSUE BY ADDING MORE? ACREAGE TO AN OVERBURDENED PARK ALREADY -- YEAH THOUGH I THINK THAT'S A GREAT CONSIDER THE A GREAT QUESTION AND CONCERN -- YOU KNOW AND SOMETIMES WE DON'T THINK ABOUT MAINTENANCE AND LIKE YOU SAID OUR OUR NATIONAL PARKS ARE OVERBURDENED BUT I THINK THAT. IN THE FUTURE THAT WE YOU KNOW AS PART OF THIS RESOLUTION THAT WE SHOULD BE WORKING ON A PLAN -- FOR MAINTENANCE OF THAT AREA I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT -- TO PUT TO ADD GREEN SPACE TO THIS AREA THAT IT'S SORELY NEEDS YOU KNOW THIS IN LOS ANGELES WHICH INCLUDES MY DISTRICT -- AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M WILLING TO WORK ON WITH THE GUT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR STATE PARKS ON YES WHAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AND JUST SO I KEEP IT FRESH IN EVERYONE'S MIND -- YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE HOW MANY ACRES MAKE UP THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY O'DONNELL NUMBER STATE WILL STAY AWHILE NO I DON'T TWO HUNDRED AND ONE MILLION ACRES. AND OF THAT HUNDRED AND ONE HOW MANY ARE ACTUALLY ALREADY AND PARKS AND PRESERVED. I DON'T KNOW YEAH PLEASE TELL ME OVER FIFTY THREE MILLION. AND OF THE REMAINING BALANCE THAT'S ON THE BOOKS WE USE LESS THAN ONE FIFTH. FOUR PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN THE STATE. WE HAVE GREEN SPACE AND IT'S NOT IN MY DISTRICT IN MY AREA AT THIS IT ROOM OF THE VALLEY WOULD ADD GREEN SPACE TO AN URBAN AREA. THE HAS BEEN IGNORED THAT HAS POOR AIR QUALITY AND VERY LITTLE GREEN SPACE -- SO THAT'S WHAT I THAT'S WHY I'M PRESENTING THIS. RESOLUTION I GET THAT I JUST LIKE TO KEEP. FRESH IN EVERYONE'S MIND WE HAVE A TON TO PRESERVE OUR THE PROBLEM IS WE DIDN'T MAYBE NECESSARILY. COULD A PARKED EVERYWHERE THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN FACT IN MANY CASES LANDS WERE ACQUIRED THAT WERE SLATED FOR PARKS IN THE STATE. GO BACK AND CHECK THE HISTORY YOU'LL FIND THAT. WE TOOK IT AWAY FROM THE PARKS AND WE PUT HOUSES ON IT. WE COVERED OVER THAT GREEN SPACE THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED. TO HAVE. AND AND AND SAUDI I I AGREE WITH YOU. YET IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. SO HAVING SAID THAT THE GETS BACK TO THE POINT HOW DO WE MANAGE OURSELVES IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE'VE MADE THE MISTAKES WE KNOW ABOUT THE MISTAKES. HOW DO WE FIX THAT AND AT THE SAME TIME COMPENSATE FOR THE FACT THAT? WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF WHAT WE DO HAVE. SO I'M JUST WHAT KIND OF MAKING A WILL IT IS. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS HERE I DON'T KNOW THAT CAN SUPPORT IT TODAY BECAUSE OF THE DEFERRED. MAINTENANCE ISSUE AND AND THE FACT THAT THE PARTS OF WAY DâN. BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THERE'S MORE SPACE THAT'S NEEDED FOR CERTAIN AREAS AND OTHER AREAS WHICH IS FINE. BUT ONE THING IS REALLY MISSING. FUNDING TO TAKE CARE OF WHAT WE ARE GOING TO PUT INTO A PARK. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON AS A COMMITTEE HERE. I THINK YOUR POINTS ARE WELL TAKEN. YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP THOSE POINTS AND I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE VALID POINTS TO A YOU KNOW IT IN ADDITION TO ADDING SPACE TO OUR PARKS. TO THINKING ABOUT THE MAINTENANCE RIGHT BECAUSE THEN THAT'S THE NEXT STEP THAT'S WHEN -- WE HEAR FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING MAINTAINED AND OUR END BUT I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST STEP -- AND I YOU KNOW I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE ELECTED IN MY AREA -- TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE'RE WORKING ON A MAINTENANCE PLAN AND FOR A SPECIAL FUNDING I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WE COME TO DO A MOTION A SECOND SOME MEMBER A REQUEST THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD FOR ADVOCATING FOR YOUR DISTRICT. AND FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WE ALL.

NINETEEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE NATURE CONSERVANCY PUBLISHED ANALYSIS OF CALIFORNIA STREAM GAUGES AND DISCOVER THAT POORLY GAUGE STREAMS FAR OUT NUMBER WHILE GATES TRIMS. AND ONLY HALF OF OUR GAUGING THE STATE ARE ACTIVE. STREAM GAGES PROVIDE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S WATER GAPS IN THE STREAM GAUGE NETWORK MAKE IT DIFFICULT UNDERSTAND STREAMFLOW CONDITIONS. I MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ENSURE THE BOTH PEOPLE AND NATURE ARE GETTING WATER WHERE AND WHEN THEY NEED IT. AN INFECTIVE STREAM GAUGE NETWORK WILL HELP SUPPORT INFORMED DECISION MAKING FOR WATER MANAGEMENT CALIFORNIA INCLUDING UNDERSTAND HOW WE UNDERSTANDING HOW WE CAN IMPROVE GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. AND THE IMPACTS OF DROUGHTS FLOODS AND EVEN WILD FIRES THAT HAVE ON OUR STREAMS OF STONES. SB NINETEEN WOULD HELP IDENTIFY WATERSHED THE HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT GAPS WERE INACTIVE GAUGES EXIST AND PRIORITIZE FUNDING TO DEPLOY GAUGES BASED UPON THE GAPS IN THE SYSTEM IMPROVING OUR DATA TO MANAGE WATER IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS MARK FENSTER MAKER ON BEHALF OF SNOW MORE WATER WERE THE WHOLESALE WATER SUPPLIER FOR CINEMA COUNTY -- WE ACTUALLY GET TO ENJOY SOMETHING OF A NETWORK OF STREAM GAUGES WE HAVE SOME IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED SYSTEM -- WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT ABOUT THESE GAUGES THE REAL TIME DATA THAT WE GET TO TO VIEW AN OBSERVER THROUGH THESE GAUGES. WE USE THIS DATA. TO TRACK A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT -- A REQUIREMENTS AS RELATES TO FLOWS COMPLIANCE FOR MINIMUMS OF THEIR BIOLOGICAL OPINION FOR FISH HABITAT WATER SUPPLY FLOWS RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN USING IT MORE TO UNDERSTAND ARE FLEDGED FLOOD MANAGEMENT EXCUSE ME AND FLOOD FORECASTING. AS WE SEE THE FLOWS INCREASE WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE DEBRIS FLOWS MIGHT BE COMING. ON THE RUSSIAN RIVER. AND RECENTLY WE STARTED PUBLISHING THIS REAL TIME DATA ON A WEBSITE SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON THAT SAID. WERE WERE UNDER GAUGED WHERE WE'D LIKE TO BE -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF THESE GAUGES WHAT WE REALLY SEE THIS BILL HELPING OUT IS? THE DEPLOYMENT OF GAUGES WE THINK THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE STATE WE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE PICKING UP MORE THE MAINTENANCE COSTS AND WE THINK THAT ASPECT OF A LOCAL STATE FEDERAL. PARTNERSHIP IS IS WHAT THIS BILL WILL ACHIEVE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR ABOUT THANK YOU BOB OTHER -- WITNESSES LOT. NAME ORGANIZATION [inaudible] THIS IS.

MR DOT -- YOU HAVE -- THIS VERY INTRIGUING -- THERE ARE A LOT OF OLD GAUGES THAT ARE AROUND. AND THEY ARE BEING USED THEIR JUST STILL SITTING OUT THERE SOME OF THE OLD. OLD STYLE THERE JUST IN OLD CULVERTS THAT ARE. COVERED AND I'VE OFTEN WONDERED WHY WE DON'T UTILIZE THAT INFORMATION AS BEST WE COULD. YES THEY WERE IN PLACE -- BUT NONE THE LESS THE BILL DOES POSE ANOTHER QUESTION. IT SAYS THE STREAMS DOES THAT MEAN ALL STREAMS. WITHIN HAVE TO BE MONITORED UNDER YOUR BILL OR WOULD BE JUST A SELECT ONES THAT ARE BEING UTILIZED. CURRENTLY FOR BENEFICIAL PURPOSES. THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST QUESTION. YES SURE I'M HAPPY TO GET TO THE QUESTIONS OF THE BILL WOULD HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES HELP PRIORITIZE WHERE WE WOULD DEPLOY GAUGES. BASED UPON DIFFERENT PRIORITIES FOR THE STATE. OKAY SECOND QUESTION THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OF STREAMS AND WATERWAYS THAT HAVE HAD. STOCK PONDS PLACED ON AND NOW THE UNDER PREVIOUS LEGISLATIVE ACTION THEY'RE REQUIRED TO MONITOR -- AND THOSE. A STREAMS WITH THAT DISBURSEMENT WATER WHETHER IT'S USED FOR OTHER BENEFICIAL PURPOSES OR JUST USE FOR RETENTION OF WATER. WITH THE FUNDS FOR THOSE TOOLS THOSE GAUGES BE PART OF THIS. OUR ACTION AS WELL SO THAT THE LAND OWNERS TO GET COST RECOVERY FOR THOSE IMPACTS OF BEEN PLACED UPON THEM. BECAUSE YOUR RETORT TO ROUTE YOU WOULD BE DERIVING STRONG BENEFICIAL INFORMATION. AS AN AGENCY. YEAH I THINK WE'RE THE BILL THE DEPARTMENT AND THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THE ABILITY TO SORT OF DETERMINE WHAT PRIORITY SHOULD BE MADE SO YOU WOULD BE SO YOU'D SEE SOME LATITUDE.

TEMPERATURES SOARED TO ONE HUNDRED DEGREES BUT THE CIRCUS DIDN'T BOTHER TO STOP FOR HIM AND HUNTINGTON PARK AT TIGER WAS NEARLY DECAPITATED.

ANOTHER ELEPHANT WITH THE CIRCUITS JOYCE HAD DIED JUST DAYS BEFORE THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE IS NO CIRCUS IS BASED IN CALIFORNIA THAT USING ANIMALS WE NEED TO EVEN THE PLAYING FIELD WITH THE OUT LIARS.

THESE ANIMALS DON'T PERFORM TRICKS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DO SO THEY DO SO BECAUSE THEY'RE TERRIFIED OF THE CONSEQUENCES IF THEY DO NOT PERFORM. AND THIS IS PETER HAS DOCUMENTED REPEATEDLY THE ANIMALS IN THE CIRCUS HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THROUGH VICIOUS BEATINGS BEHIND THE SCENES. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM IF THEY DO NOT -- BANG -- AND THEY SPEND MUCH OF THEIR LIVES EVEN DAYS ON AND LANGUISHING IN DARK BARREN TRAILERS SO AS A RESULT OF THIS TREATMENT ANIMALS CAN LASH OUT IN FRUSTRATION. MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN IMPLICATED IN HUMAN INJURIES AND EVEN IN HUMAN DEATHS -- THE I'VE SEEN THE FIRST HAND THE TOTAL FAILURE OF OUR EXISTING LAWS TO PROTECT THESE ANIMALS AND TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC.

WOULD I WOULD I TWO ONE FOUR I WILL BE TO OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SENATOR HERTZBERG. THIS IS OUR OF FINAL BILL ON THE AGENDA. YOU DO HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION -- SENATOR. SOME OF THE MOTION BY MISS RUBIO. SECOND BY MS GARCIA DO PASS RECOMMENDATION THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY BRIEFLY I HAVE NO NOTES -- BECAUSE THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL. ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN I FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WITH RESPECT. TO OUR CONSERVATION IS A WAY OF LIFE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO IN THE FACE OF THE DROUGHTS. BY THE GOVERNOR BROWN -- ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER A DRAMATICALLY REDUCING THE USE OF WATER IN CALIFORNIA. HE HAD A TRAILER BILL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT WE IN THE LEGISLATURE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER THAT THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT BETWEEN BOTH HOUSES ENGAGE IN THE PROCESS IS APPROPRIATE. AND SO IS A TEAM OF MEASURES A MEASURE BY SENATOR FRIEDMAN. ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN MAYBE CENTER FROM DAY -- AND MYSELF TO BASICALLY MAKE CONSERVATION IS A WAY OF LIFE THIS MEASURE CORRECTS. A A CHALLENGE THAT WAS FACED IN TERMS OF INTERPRETING WHAT THAT MEANT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE CONSERVATION EFFORTS ARE DO YOU LOOK AT IT AGENCY TOE IN TOTALITY OF ITS RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL. AGRICULTURE OF THE USE IN TERMS OF ITS REDUCTION OR DO YOU LOOK AT EACH HOUSE WE RECEIVED SOME CRITICISMS ALONG THE WAY THAT PEOPLE SAID OH MY GOD I CAN'T FLUSH MY TOILET TAKE A SHOWER IN THE SAME DAY. BECAUSE OF THIS THAT WASN'T THE INTENT WERE CLARIFYING THAT WITH THIS MEASURE ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THEY HAVE WHAT'S AHEAD WITH CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT THIS MEASURE -- AS SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HERTZBERG NOTED -- THERE WAS A HERCULEAN EFFORT TO ADVANCE GROUNDBREAKING LEGISLATION TO MAKE CONSERVATION A WAY OF LIFE WE WERE PROUD TO SUPPORT THE FINAL PACKAGE INCLUDING SB SIX OH SIX AND A. B. -- SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT URBAN WATER SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MEETING IN URBAN WATER OBJECTIVE USE OBJECTIVE MADE UP OF FOUR COMPONENTS INDOOR USE OUTDOOR USE. SEE I DEDICATED YOUR GIPSON METERS AND WATER LOSS. THE TOTALS OF EACH COMPONENT WILL BE ADDED UP TO ESTABLISH A CUMULATIVE OBJECTIVE FOR EACH SUPPLIER THIS APPROACH WE FEEL PROVIDES EACH WATER SUPPLIER THE FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE WHICH AREAS THEY WILL FOCUS ON BASED WHAT BASED ON WHAT IS BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER IN TWENTY FIFTEEN PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF THE CUT CONSERVATION BILLS SB FIVE FIVE FIVE DIRECTED D. W. ARE IN THE WATER BOARD TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS RELATED TO WATER LOSS. INCLUDING THE ADOPTION OF VOLUMETRIC PERFORMANCE STANDARDS BY TWENTY TWENTY WHEN THE STATE BOARD ADOPTS THESE REGULATIONS WATER LOSS WILL BECOME ENFORCEABLE -- AS A STANDALONE TARGET UNLIKE ANY OTHER. ELEMENT IN THE OBJECTIVE. THIS MEANS THAT IF A WATER SUPPLIER MEETS THEIR OBJECTIVE BUT CHOOSES TO FOCUS ON REDUCTIONS IN OUR WATER USE AND DOES NOT MEET THEIR WATER LOSS TARGET. THEY WOULD FACE AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION UNDER THE WATER LOSS REGULATIONS BUT IF SOME REASON AN AGENCY DOES NOT MEET THEIR OBJECTIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY MEETING THE WATER LOSS STANDARD THE SUPPLIER COULD FACE TWO SIMULTANEOUS ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WERE ONE VIOLATION. OF LET ME BE CLEAR WATER SUPPLIERS ARE COMMITTED TO WATER LOSS AND WE WANT TO MEET THE OBJECTIVES THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE LEGISLATION. YOU KNOW AND ACTIVELY REDUCE WATER LOSS IT MAKES FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL SENSE TO DO SO. I'M WE FEEL WATER LOSS IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT IN THE OBJECTIVE AND THE CAPTURES A SYSTEMS VARIOUS WATER USES BUT WE DON'T FEEL IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR WATER SYSTEMS TO FACE TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FOR THE SAME VIOLATION. WE BELIEVE SB ONE THIRTY FOUR IS A COMMONSENSE MEASURING COMPLIMENTS THE EFFORTS OF WATER SUPPLIERS BY PROVIDING CLARITY THAT IF A WATER SYSTEM EXCEEDS THEIR WATER LOSS PERFORMANCE STANDARD. AND IT RESULTS IN AN X. EVEN SERVE THE URBAN YOU SUBJECTIVE THAT SYSTEM WILL ONLY FACE AND FOR SOME ACTION UNDER THE WATER LOSS STANDARDS AND NOT THE CONSERVATION STATUTES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. BRIEFLY I TURN MEMBERS NIKITA CROWDY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL WE WERE PREVIOUSLY OPPOSED SB. ONE THIRTY FOUR I WE BELIEVE THAT THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE WE CAN EXISTING LAW BY MAKING WATER LOSS PERFORMANCE STANDARDS UNENFORCEABLE BUT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO BRING. A SUPPORTERS THE OPPONENTS AND THE ADMINISTRATION TOGETHER TO CRAFT A COMPROMISE THAT IS BOTH FAIR AND BALANCED I'M AND WITH THAT WE ARE NOW IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS -- WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE. PLEASE COME FORWARD. NATALIE NEXT ON BEHALF OF FRIENDS OF THE LA RIVER IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. JULIE HOLE WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL BUT WE JUST WHEN I THINK THE AUTHORS OFFICE THE SPONSOR AND THEN OTHERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THE BILL FOR CONTINUING TO WORK WITH US ON THE SPECIFIC. LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THANK YOU. PRINT ALSO SERICA CALIFORNIA WE WANNA ATTRIBUTE OUR COMMENTS TO THAT OF IN OUR DC WE ORIGINALLY OPPOSED BUT WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S MOMENTS IN. THE FORD WORKING WITH HIM THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- THOSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THE MEASURE PLEASE COME FORWARD HIS -- DO IT FROM HERE IF THAT'S OKAY WITH A CHAIR BUT READ. ON BEHALF OF READ GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WITH THE WATER DISTRICTS ARE LISTED ON THE ANALYSIS IN OPPOSITION. WE'RE AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF WERE IN OUR DC WAS WE SUPPORTED THE BILL AS IT WAS INTRODUCED AND AND NOW FIND OURSELVES IN OPPOSITION WE APPRECIATE THE COMPROMISE WITH RESPECT TO ENFORCEMENT. BUT IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO MEET THE WATER LOSS STANDARD SEPARATE AND APART FROM. THE A COMPROMISE LIST OF COMPONENTS THAT MAKE UP THE WATER -- USE OBJECTIVE WE THINK THE CLEANER UP PLACE WOULD BE TO JUST PUT THE WATER LOSS STANDARD IN THE URBAN WATER USE OBJECTIVE AND NOT HAVE IT BE A SEPARATE THE STANDARD THAT'S WHY THEY REMAIN OPPOSED THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH A MOTION SECOND FOR ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SAY NO. ONE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT'S A NON THE CENTER WHICH LED TO SPELLS ASTRONOMICAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AS A TO PASS UP PLEASE QUESTION I'M SORRY. SENATOR JUST A YOU JUST HEARD THAT LAST LITTLE CLOSER FROM -- MISTER REED -- IS THERE ANY WAY TO MAYBE FIND SOME CLARITY. THE KIND OF DANCING WITH THAT BALANCE OF OF THE LANGUAGE THERE. AS HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IS. MAYBE TO THE SPONSOR THE LOS ALSO GO BACK BUT BUT THE THE TH A MY MY THINKING IS THAT THAT. THEY JUST DON'T READ AND WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE HOWEVER I DID TRY. TO MEET THAT STANDARD I DID TRY TO ACHIEVE THAT OBJECTIVE IN THE PROCESS AND BE HAPPY TO CIRCLE BACK WITH BUT I THINK WE'VE ACHIEVED THE OBJECTIVE. AND TO CLARIFY THE POSITION. YEAH AND I THINK THAT THE ISSUE IS THE FACT THAT -- THE WATER LOSS REGULATIONS PREDATED THE CONSERVATION STATUTES SO THERE'S AN EXISTING PROCESS IN PLACE UNDER SB. FIVE FIVE FIVE SO THAT'S WHY WE WORK ON THE COMPROMISE WITH THE SENATOR AND THE OPPOSITION YEAH WELL I I FOUND MYSELF IN A PRECARIOUS POSITION I I ACTUALLY LIKE WHAT YOU'VE DONE. BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE IF OU CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT SO IF YOU CAN DO THAT AWESOME OF COURSE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY -- BUT I I I THINK YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF GOOD WORK HERE TRYING. TO WE GOT TOO MANY EXAMPLES I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER EXAMPLES FOR WITH LAYERED. COMPONENTS LIKE THIS AND WE MULTIPLE TIMES FOR JUST DOING ONE ACTION SO. THANK GOD TO IT THOUGH. THE THIS IS BEEN A THIS PROCESS TOOK OVER A YEAR OF JUST EXTENSIVE MEETINGS THE WATER WILL YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS. TO TO REACH AGREEMENTS THAT RESPECT ON CONSERVATION IN PARTICULAR SO IS ONE SMALL PIECE OF A GIGANTIC A ENDEAVOR OF A CHANGING AND REALLY PUTTING IN INTO A THOUGHTFUL AND THE AND FAR REACHING CONSERVATION STANDARDS WHICH REALLY HAVE BROAD ALMOST EVERYBODY TO THE TABLE.
