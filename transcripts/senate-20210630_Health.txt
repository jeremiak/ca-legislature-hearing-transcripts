BY ELIMINATING THE OUTDATED MEDICAL ASSETS TEST THE CURRENT MEDICAL ASSETS TO TEST LIMITS WRONGFULLY PREVENT SENIORS FROM HAVING ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO WHETHER A CRISIS SUCH AS EVICTION A LEAKING ROOF FOR A MAJOR VEHICLE REPAIR ONCE AN ADULT TURN SIXTY FIVE OR BECOMES MEDICARE ELIGIBLE THEIR MENTAL CAL ELIGIBILITY IS DETERMINED BY THIS RESTRICTIVE SET OF RULES THAT REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE MINIMAL ASSETS TO REMAIN ELIGIBLE THE UNINTENDED RESULT IS THAT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO REMAIN MEDICAL ELIGIBLE DEPLETE ALL OF THE RESOURCES. TO CONTINUE RECEIVING BENEFITS I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THE STORY OF AN OLDER ADULTS WHO HAS MANAGED WHO HAVE AN ANNUAL INCOME OF SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH IS UNDER THE NON MAG I MEDICAL IMAGE INCOME LIMIT UNFORTUNATELY THIS SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD IS UNABLE TO QUALIFY. FOR MEDICAL. DURING SORRY I LOST MY PLACE HERE.

AND LEAVING HER ONLY WITH ONE VIABLE OPTION TO SPEND DOWN AND COMPLETELY DEPLETE HER SAVINGS TO ONLY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY STORIES OF INDIVIDUALS FACING SUCH CHALLENGES ANTIQUATED POLICIES LIKE THE MEDICAL ASSETS HAS NOT ONLY PUT INDIVIDUALS IN SUCH COMPROMISING POSITIONS BUT ALSO PREVENT LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR. FOR CREATING ANY KIND OF WELL TO TRANSFER TO THEIR CHILDREN THAT'S A WIDENING THE INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH TRANSFER AMONG PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE SURVIVED A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WHERE WE HAVE SEEN HOW OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HAVE FACED HIGHER RISK OF COVERT NINETEEN COMPLICATIONS IN PARTICULAR IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE MEDICAL PROGRAMS.

I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THIS BILL. AND THINK THE AUTHOR. THE RUBIO. THANK YOU- I ALSO WANTED AS COMMENDED THE OTHER FOR BRING THIS FORWARD THIS IS AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH SO MANY OF OUR SENIORS AND ESPECIALLY MY DISTRICT MY SENIOR CENTERS AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOR AWHILE I IT IS INCREDIBLE HOW YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MANY BARRIERS ALREADY EXISTING FOR PEOPLE TO GET QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND THIS IS.

BUT THIS IS A REALLY GOOD BILL AND- THAT THE ONLY THING THAT CAUSED ME PAUSE IS THAT YOUR PRIMARY WITH. A WITNESS SAID TO LAR IT'S TULARE. AN THAT I REPRESENT NOT TOO LARGE. BUT I'M STILL GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH MEMBERS ANY FURTHER. CHRIS SENATOR WIENER. SO WHEN I THINK OF IT THIS IS. I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT. HAS BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR SO LONG WITHOUT VARIOUS BILLS AROUND. CAL WORKS IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOW. IT SAYS. I WISH BECAUSE WHITE THESE ASSET TYPES AWAY. COMPLETELY THERE'S LIKE. TOTAL FANTASY NOTION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE GONNA. WHEN THE LOTTERY AND HAVE ALL THIS MONEY AND NEVERTHELESS GO THROUGH ALL THE HOOPS TO KEEP GETTING CAL WORKS- MEDI CAL OR AT THE HOUSE IT'S JUST IT'S ABSURD AS THE IMAGES WHILE YOU'RE RUNNING THIS BILL- AND WE SHOULD NOT BE. CREATING INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO STAY. ALIVE IN POVERTY AND SOMEONE AS YOU KNOW WAS ABLE TO ACCUMULATE SOME MONEY SO THEY HAVE A QUESTIONS THAT THEY CAN. HELP YOU KNOW WITH WHATEVER THEY NEED IN LIFE- THE IDEA THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY THEIR BENEFITS IT IT MAKES NO SENSE SO THANK YOU FOR DOING. FOR ALL DURING THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR WIENER. ASSEMBLY WOMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE SENATORS FOR THE AND THE DISCUSSION FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE BILL I AM STARTING MY FOURTH YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE AND I'VE BEEN CARRYING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. SINCE I STARTED. AND I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS UNTIL WE HAVE UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THIS IS AN ISSUE OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE AS WELL. THE FACT THAT. OUR MULTIPLE POPULATION AND SENIORS HAVE TO SPEND DOWN EVERY LITTLE BIT OF SAVINGS AT THE HOUSE SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. ONCE THEY REACH A CERTAIN AGE IT'S REALLY REPOSTEROUS AND THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS PERPETUATING SYSTEMIC SYSTEM OF. CONTINUAL POVERTY IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ISSUES FROM MEDICAL ASSETS TO CALFRESH AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS AND SO. WE HAVE BEEN AND I WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK BE ADVOCATES. AND HEALTH FOR ALL AND EVERYONE THAT'S BEEN WORKING. FOR YEARS EVEN BEFORE I GOT HERE EVEN BEFORE MANY OF US GOT ERE. TO ELIMINATE THE MEDICAL ASSETS TEST AND TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE TO LIVE IN DIGNITY TO BE SAFE. AND TO HAVE A QUALITY LIFE ONCE THEY REACH. AN OLDER AGE WHICH I HOPE WE ALL GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO. AND SO THIS ELIMINATING THE MEDICAL ASSETS TEST- CREATES PARITY BETWEEN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. AND ALLOWS LOW INCOME PEOPLE TO QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID ALL WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE MONEY AND PAY FOR THEIR BILLS ARE HOME REPAIRS. AND SIMPLY BUILD ON THEIR EMERGENCY FUNDS IN PREPARATION FOR ANY ECONOMIC OR HEALTH CRISIS. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO BE FORCED TO. CHOOSE BETWEEN MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY HEALTH CARE AND PAIN FOR THEIR EVERYDAY NECESSITIES IN LIFE AND SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN. AND GOT MAD MUSICAL AUTHOR TO PLEASE IT IS SUCH A GREAT BILL. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR EGGMAN AND IT IS A TO PASS THAT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS METAL CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AND MELENDEZ. EGGMAN GONZALEZ.

AND THIS THE CONSEQUENCES OF PROVIDING FIFTY CARE CHARLES VULNERABLE CALIFORNIA BEFORE PROCEED WITH MY COMMENTS I WANT TO CONFIRM THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS OFFERED BY THIS COMMITTEE. NURSING HOMES BECAME THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE TO LIVE AND WORK DURING THE COLD AT NINETEEN PANDEMIC WITH NEARLY THIRTEEN THOUSAND LIVES LOST AT THESE FACILITIES OVER THE PAST YEAR. BEST NEARLY ONE IN FOUR CULVERTED NINETEEN DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO NEGLIGENCE AND UNSAFE PRACTICES. THIS BILL PERMITS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION TO RECOVER UNPAID NURSING HOME PENALTIES FROM BAD ACTORS COMMITTING SERIOUS VIOLATIONS AGAINST PATIENTS SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WILL ALLOW US CDPH TO COLLECT UNPAID PENALTIES. FROM AFFILIATED BUSINESSES THAT ARE OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE LICENSEES OF THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. THESE TYPES OF AFFILIATED BUSINESSES ARE BETTER KNOWN AS RELATED PARTIES A RECENT L. A. COUNTY STUDY ALSO IDENTIFIED COMPLEX OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES. TIME MULTIPLE RELATED PARTIES AND NURSING HOMES TOGETHER HAVE ALLOW BAD ACTORS TO OBSCURE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIMIT THEIR LEGAL EXPOSURE TO TRUE ACCOUNTABILITY. IN EFFECT THESE LICENSEES HAVE MADE THEIR BUSINESS STRUCTURES SO COMPLICATED THAN FORSMAN AND PENALTIES IS DIFFICULT. AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE'S AN ESTIMATED FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN UNPAID CITATIONS TO NURSING FACILITIES THAT FAIL TO PAY FOR QUALITY OF CARE ISSUES. WHEN THREE OF THE TOP FIVE NURSING HOMES THAT RECEIVE THE MOST FINDS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS ARE OWNED BY LARGE CHAIN STILL ACQUIRING NEW FACILITIES IT IS CLEAR OUR CURRENT ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING. BY EXPANDING DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH BACON HOLD RESPONSE THEY CAN HOLD THESE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSE FROM SEARS VIOLATIONS AB TEN FORTY TWO BILLS ACCOUNTABILITY AND INCENTIVES ALL PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION NURSING HOMES TO PROVIDE QUALITY.

I SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN GOOD AFTERNOON I THINK YOU WERE HERE TO PRESENT AB. TEN TWENTY. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON. FIRST A MEDICAL DEBT IS A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF BANKRUPTCIES POVERTY AND RACIAL INEQUALITY IN CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OUR PREDECESSORS IN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED TWO KEY REFORMS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS AT RISK PERFECT FOR FINANCIAL DEVASTATION. BOTH THE HOSPITAL FAIR PRICING ACT AND THE FAIR DEPT CODE COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT WERE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTION INTO COLLECTION AND INCREASED PATIENT AWARENESS OF FREE AND DISCOUNTED MEDICAL CARE OF WHICH FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS THERE IS AVAILABLE AVAILABILITY IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXACTLY THAT. IN FACT HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA MUST BY LAW PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PATIENTS WHO RECEIVE MEDICAL SERVICES THAT ARE UNDER INSURED OR UNINSURED THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE CONSISTS OF FULL OR PARTIAL DISCOUNT OF MEDICAL BILLS AND PAYMENT PLANS. THE HOSPITAL FOR PRICING I PROVIDES THE MINIMUM GUIDELINES THAT HOSPITALS MUST FOLLOW AND OFFERING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PATIENTS AND COLLECTING UNPAID ACCOUNTS. DEBT COLLECTORS TO MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES. HOWEVER DESPITE HIS PROTECTIONS PATIENTS ARE STILL NOT ALWAYS BENEFITING FROM THE LAW. KAISER HEALTH NEWS REPORTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT NONPROFIT HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BUT DID NOT. A SORRY COULD HAVE BUT DID NOT PROVIDE A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CHARITY CARE TO PATIENTS. PATIENTS REPORTED BEING DISCHARGED AND RECEIVING MEDICAL BILLS WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL OR COULD HAVE APPLIED FOR CHARITY CARE. WORSE THE HOSPITAL'S OFTEN SOLD THOSE PATIENTS ACCOUNT TO COLLECTION AGENCIES WHICH FURTHER NEGLECTED TO INFORM PATIENTS THAT THEY COULD APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OR BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE OUT. CONSEQUENTLY WE HAVE HEARD TESTIMONY AFTER TESTIMONY FROM WITNESSES WHO FACED BANKRUPTCY WHO WEREN'T ABLE TO BE HIRED FOR JOBS WERE UNABLE TO BUT TO GET LINES OF CREDIT. BECAUSE I'M A PLACE COLLECTION LAWSUITS FOR DEBT THAT THEY ACTUALLY COULD HAVE HAD PAID THROUGH MEDICAL OR COULD HAVE GOTTEN SOME KIND OF RELEASE BUT BY LAW. TO ADDRESS THE GAPS IN EXISTING LAW AND STRENGTHEN PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS CONSUMERS AB TEN TWENTY DOES THE FOLLOWING. IT STRENGTHENS STATE ENFORCEMENT OVERSIGHT OF THE HOSPITAL FAIR PRICING ACT BY PENALIZING HOSPITALS WHO DO NOT COMPLY AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE HOSPITALS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS DOABLE ACCEPTABLE TO THEM. PROVIDE PATIENTS WITH MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BILLS AND HOW TO APPLY FOR PUBLIC PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICAL. AS WELL AS CHARITY CARE AT THE TIME OF JUST CHARGE AND ALSO ONE OF BILLS SENT TO COLLECTIONS. WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT. IT'S HOSPITALS FROM SELLING PATIENT AT. IT EXTENDS ADVERSE CREDIT REPORTING A COMMENCEMENT OF CIVIL ACTION. FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS AFTER THE INITIAL BILLING. PROGRAMS AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BEFORE THEY FILED AGAINST THAT PATIENT. AND IT RAISES THE INCOME LEVEL FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FROM 310050% OF THE POVERTY LEVEL TO FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT. WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL OF THE AFFECTED PARTIES WE REACH A LOT OF AGREEMENT WITH A LOT OF THE STAKEHOLDERS.

IT INCREASE ELIGIBILITY TO HUNDRED OF THE PRODUCT LINE. IT HAS STATE OVERSIGHT OF POLICIES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. MYERS NOTED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICIES CAN PATIENTS BY HOSPITAL. IT ALSO REQUIRES DEBT COLLECTORS TO SHOW THAT A PATIENT HADN'T SCREEN FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WITH FILING A LAWSUIT. IT WOULD ALSO BAN THE SALE OF MEDICAL DEBT DEBT BUYERS HOSPITALS WE CAN CONTROL OVER THAT. YOU'RE PRETTY CLEAR HI HELLO FROM YOUR HOSPITAL PROVIDING CARE.

WHILE AT MEMORIAL CARE THEY TOLD MY HUSBAND TO BORROW MONEY FROM MY FAMILY MEMBERS AND PAY OUT OF POCKET BEFORE THEY WILL CONTINUE MY TREATMENT. NONE OF THE HOSPITALS INFORMED US OF ANY POTENTIAL FINANCIAL HELP OR RESOURCES. WE STARTED TO RECEIVE NUMEROUS HOSPITAL BILLS IN THE MAIL AND PHONE CALLS THEY WOULD CALL ME WHILE I WAS STILL IN THE HOSPITAL THEY WILL CALL MY HUSBAND AT WORK DEMANDING PAYMENT. WE WERE SCARED WE FELT ALONE AND TERRIFIED AND AT TIMES I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF I HAD JUST DIED AND MY HUSBAND WOULD HAVE TO.

THANKS VERY MUCH MODERATOR WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES WE DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION BOTH ON THE TELEPHONIC LINES A MODERATOR. PLEASE BRING ON DAVID REID FROM RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL AND CLIFF BURKE FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COLLECTORS WHO EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES TOTAL FOR MINUTES BETWEEN THE BOTH OF YOU SO ONE GOES OVER THE TAKES LESS TIME OFF- SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH THE DAVID READ. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DAVID REID AND I'M GENERAL COUNSEL AT THE RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL. ARMY I SUPPOSE IN AB TEN TWENTY TWO TO A SINGLE SENTENCE IN THIS EIGHTEEN PAGE BILL. THE SENTENCE APPEARS ON PAGE TWELVE ONE THIRTY TWO AND THIRTY THREE AND READS A HOSPITAL SHALL NOT SELL PATIENT THAT TOO WITHOUT BUYER. AB TEN TWENTY SIX TO SET HIGHER STANDARDS FOR THE COLLECTION POSSIBLE THAT FOR BOTH HOSPITALS AND COLLECTORS. THIS IS A GOAL THAT ARMY I WHOLE HEARTEDLY SUPPORTS HOWEVER UNDER THE BILL DEBT BUYING COMPANIES WHICH ARMY I REPRESENTS WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM EVEN ATTEMPTING TO MEET ANY STANDARD. BECAUSE THESE BUSINESSES WOULD BE STATUTORILY BANNED FROM PARTICIPATING. IN THIS HIGHLY REGULATED MARKETPLACE. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY ARMY I SUPPORTS THE MORE RIGOROUS STANDARDS CONTAINED IN THIS BILL IS BECAUSE ARMY I HAS ALREADY ADOPTED HIGHER STANDARDS FOR DEBT BUYING COMPANIES WHO ARE PURCHASING AND COLLECTING. ON POSSIBLE THAT THIS PART OF ARMENIA IS NATIONAL CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. IN FACT ARMY EYES STANDARDS WILL STILL GO ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THIS BILL IS REQUIRING THAT HOSPITALS AND COLLECTION AGENCIES WHO ARE STILL PERMITTED TO COLLECT HOSPITAL THAT. ARMY EYES HIGHER STANDARDS HAS RESULTED IN RECORD LOW PATIENT COMPLAINTS AGAINST MEDICAL DEBT BUYING COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA WHEN ANALYZING THE FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU'S CONSUMER COMPLAINT PORTAL ARMY I FOUND A TOOL ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED THIRTY COMPLAINTS IN CALIFORNIA'S CONCERNING MEDICAL DEBT. OF WHICH ONLY TWELVE COMPLAINTS WHICH IS LESS THAN 1% WERE AGAINST MEDICAL DEBT BUYERS. SIMPLY PUT THERE IS NO POLICY REASON TO TAKE THE EXTRAORDINARY STEP OF PROHIBITING THE MOST COMPLIANT SECTOR OF THE INDUSTRY FROM BEING ABLE TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA. IN CONCLUSION THIS IS A GOOD BILL AND WORTHY OF YOUR SUPPORT ALL ARMY I IS REQUESTING IS THAT THIS COMMITTEE SIX ONE SENTENCE IN THE EIGHTEEN PAGE BILL. ARMY EYES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WOULD NOT ONLY HOLD DEBT BUYING COMPANIES TO THE SAME STANDARDS THIS BILL HOLDS HOSPITALS AND COLLECTION AGENCIES. BUT WOULD ADD ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS YOU MAY HAVE SET THE. BAR EVEN HIGHER THANK YOU. THANK VERY MUCH IN OUTLOOK MOVE ON TO CLIFF BERG FROM CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COLLECTORS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CLIFF BURKE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS. OFF FIRST OFF I DO WANT TO SAY THAT WE SUPPORT THE- AUTHOR IN SPONSORED CONTENT HERE OF ENSURING THAT CONSUMERS GET ADEQUATE INFORMATION ABOUT. THE CHARITY CARE AND OTHER FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITIES TO AVOID THE- NATIONAL CRISIS IS THAT THE COMMITTEE IS HEARD ABOUT NINE FACT WE DO NOT WANT THOSE KINDS OF. ACCOUNTS IN THE SYSTEM. I AM ALSO PLEASED TO REPORT THAT YOU WORK CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE BILL'S SPONSORS IN AGREEING TO AMENDMENTS ARE CONCERNS RELATED TO OPERATIONAL ISSUES IN IMPLEMENTATION WE ARE RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES. AND BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR IN DECATUR DEBTS THAT YOU WILL TAKE. OUR RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS THAT WE WILL NO LONGER BE OPPOSED TO THE BILL- WHEN THOSE AMENDMENTS GO INTO THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S TIME. THANKS VERY MUCH WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY TEN TWENTY WILL BEGIN WITH ROOM FOR TWO OR THREE SEEN ON ROOM FOR TWO OR THREE OF US MOVED TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY SEEN ON ONE TWENTY FORTY MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE. WITNESSES WHICH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. TO EIGHTY TEN TWENTY NAME ORGANIZATION POSITION ONLY. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN CHRIS PLACE ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. IMMEDIATELY IN OPPOSITION ONCE AGAIN ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. WE SHOULD KNOW LINE'S COMING AT THIS TIME MISTER KERR RIGHT THANK YOU MODERATOR WILL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OF THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY SARAH GONZALEZ- SO THE CENTER FRIEDMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- NOW I KNOW THE- I GUESS ONE OF THE OPPOSITION. IT'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE SELLING TO THAT I THINK IT'S BEEN SORT OF EXPLAINED IN THE- ANALYSIS HOWEVER IF YOU WISH TO ELABORATE ON THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES THAT D. GREAT- BUT AT THE END OF THIS IS AN AREA THAT NEEDS MUCH NEED OF REFORM IN AND- AND- REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I DO THINK SOME OF THE ISSUES ALSO PERHAPS WOULD BE ADDRESSING JUDICIARY AND I KNOW YOU'RE TAKING A SET OF AMENDMENTS THAT WILL BE TAKEN UP IN JUDICIARY. FELT PERHAPS THAT SOUNDS LIKE WITH THE DRESS OF LEAST CONCERN OF SOME OF THE OPPOSITION AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. BUT THAT WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP IN YOUR SUPPORT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH- ANY STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE CONCERNED WE ARE TAKING AMENDMENTS AND JUDICIARY. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT UNLIKE CREDIT CARD DEBT AND OTHER TYPES OF DEBT MEDICAL THAT IS VERY COMPLICATED. AND A LOT OF TIMES IT'S REALLY HARD TO TELL WHO ACTUALLY OWES THE MONEY- IS IT MONEY THAT MEDICARE SHOULD BE REIMBURSING ASSUMING THE HOSPITAL SHOULD REDUCE THE DEBT. SO WHEN YOU SELL THE DEBT. YOU REALLY DISCONNECT THE HOSPITAL NOW FROM THAT PROCESS AND FOR THE PATIENT. THEY NO LONGER IN A IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY NEGOTIATE WITH THE ONES WHO MAY OR MAY NOT EVEN CONTROL WOULD. BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE BILLS. SO KEEPING THAT COLLECTION IS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINATING SOURCE. BY ALLOWING THE HOSPITAL TO ASSIGN THE DEBT WITH A COMPANY THAT THEY CAN WORK WITH AND STAYING COMMUNICATION WITH. WE BELIEVE IS PARAMOUNT TO- TO MAKING SURE THAT THE RESOLUTION IS JUSTIFIED. SO THAT'S WHY THAT PIECE IS IN THERE. AND WITH THAT I WOULD REQUEST AND I BOTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS VERY MUCH SO IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER GONZALEZ THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THE FIRST BE RE REFER TO THE CAMINO JUDICIARY. CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PAN HI MELINDA'S. EGG GONZALEZ.

MOVING FORWARD ROBUST AND CLEAR NURSING HOME OVERSIGHT BY CDPH WILL BE CRITICAL. TO AVERT FURTHER TRAGEDIES THAT ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE COLD IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC. CLASS DOUBLY CITATIONS OF THE MOST SERIOUS AN ONLY ISSUE THE CDPH CRUISE OF THE FACILITIES ACTIONS WAS THE CAUSE OF A RESIDENTS THAT. THE CURRENT DIRECT PROXIMATE CAUSE LEGAL STANDARD DISPATCHERS CREATE INCONSISTENCY WHEN APPLYING CLASS W. CITATIONS IN OUR STATE'S NURSING HOMES BECAUSE COURTS AND LEGAL EXPERTS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT DIRECT PROXIMATE CAUSES CONFUSING AND UNCLEAR. IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS SINCE REJECTED THE APPLICATION OF PROXIMATE CAUSE AND COURTS HAVE SINCE A LOT OF THE SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR TEST. THE CHANGES. FACT PROPOSED UNDER AB THREE TWENTY THREE IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR NURSING HOMES AND FACILITIES APPEAL ACOSTA POLICE CITATION IN THE SUPERIOR COURT. THE STATE HAS THE BURDEN OF PROVING THE JUDGE MUST APPLY THAT CAUSATION STANDARD IN STATUTE. ADDITIONALLY PENALTY AMOUNTS CREATE A DISINCENTIVE FOR FACILITIES TO VIOLATE HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT THESE AMOUNTS HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH INFLATION. AB THREE TWENTY THREE INCREASES AND REVISES THOSE STATUTORY AMOUNTS. AS WAS MENTIONED THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO THIS IS THE FIFTH YEAR THE WE HAVE IN GOOD FAITH TRY TO THREAD THE NEEDLE ON A COMPROMISE THE CD PH IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT NOW THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE AN ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVE WE CAN ACCEPT THAT WOULD NOT ALSO TRIGGER. OPPOSITION FROM C. B. H.

WE FOUND THAT THE CURRENT LEGAL STANDARDS GOVERNING CITATIONS ARE NURSING HOMES DOCTORS AND LYFT AND CONFUSING AND LEAD TO THE UNEVEN AND INSUFFICIENT PROTECTION OF OTHER THAN.

THAT BILL HAS SIX VOTES FOR THE BILL ON CALL ALL RIGHT I THINK NEXT IS- SOMEONE WERE ARRAIGNED IN LAW BELIEVES OKAY JUST TAKING. MY ORDER BILLS HERE. ON ON HERE. HEY THANK YOU MEMBER OKAY I GIVE ME A MOMENT HERE OKAY SO THAT'S ITEM NUMBER NINE AB TEN NINETY FOUR BY SOME ARAMBULA WELCOME THESE AGAIN THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB TEN NINETY FOUR WILL ESTABLISH A PILOT PROGRAM IN SELECTED GEOGRAPHICALLY AND DEMOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE CALIFORNIA COUNTIES TO TRAIN CORONERS AND MEDICAL EXAMINERS ON THE COLLECTION AND REPORTING OF GENDER IDENTITY AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION INFORMATION IN CASES OF VIOLENT DEATH SUCH AS HOMICIDE AND SUICIDE. ACCORDING TO THE CDC MORE THAN SEVEN PEOPLE PER HOUR DIE IN THE UNITED STATES FROM VIOLENT DEATHS MORE THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DIE FROM HOMICIDE MORE THAN FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND DIE FROM SUICIDE. DATA ON VIOLENT DEATHS CAN BE USED TO BEST DIRECT RESOURCES TO LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ENTITIES AND NONPROFIT VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RISK OF VIOLENT DEATH AND AN INDIVIDUAL'S SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY. AN ESTIMATED FIVE POINT 3% OF OVERALL ADULT CALIFORNIA POPULATION IDENTIFY AS LGBTQ. CURRENTLY NO U. S. JURISDICTION OR AGENCY ROUTINELY OR SYSTEMATICALLY COLLECTS INFORMATION ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL'S SO GI AT THE TIME OF DEATH. UNLIKE VETERAN STATUS OR ETHNICITY DATA COLLECTION AROUND SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AND GENDER IDENTITY IS ONLY CAPTURED IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. BY TRAINING CORNERS AND MEDICAL EXAMINERS ON HOW TO GATHER MORTALITY DATA WITH REGARD TO THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY RESEARCHERS AND POLICY MAKERS CAN BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND HOW ORIENTATIONS AND IDENTITIES ARE UNIQUELY IMPACTED IN THE L. G. B. T. Q. COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS HOW T ALLOCATE RESOURCES THAT WILL HELP TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PREVENTABLE DEATHS. WE MUST HAVE BETTER DATA TO UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUTH. WHEN IT COMES TO VIOLENT DEATHS INCLUDING HOMICIDE AND SUICIDE. AB TEN NINETY FOUR IS AN IMPORTANT AND HUMANE STEP AND ULTIMATELY PREVENTING THESE DEATHS TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB TEN NINETY FOUR OR SAM BRITTON VICE PRESIDENT OF ADVOCACY WITH THE TREVOR NOAH PROJECT AND TOMMY MARTIN.

ON INDICATE VIOLENT DEATH BUT DEATH AND HOMICIDE ARMYTAGE OF THE PROJECT HAS SHOWN LBGTQ YOU EXPERIENCE HIGHER RATES OF VIOLENT PARTICULARLY GENDER MINORITY TRANS AND NON BINARY OF COLOR. HOWEVER WE DO NOT KNOW THE RATE OF COMPLETED SUICIDE OR VIOLENCE LEADING TO A FATAL INJURY IN THE POPULATION WHICH LEAVES A WIDE GAP IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY. COLLECTING THE DATA ABOUT THE PACK RENDITION AND GENERATE ANY OTHER VICTIMS OF VIOLENT DEATH IS NECESSARY FOR CALIFORNIANS WILL BENEFIT THOSE WHO SEEK TO ADDRESS THESE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS. THIS DATA WILL ALLOW RESEARCHERS AND POLICY MAKERS JUST LIKE YOURSELF TO IDENTIFY TRENDS AND PATTERNS AFFECTING LGBTQ PEOPLE THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED AND I LOOKED DIED. AT BIRTH THE LEGISLATION IN THE NATION THIS WILL BE A REVOLUTIONARY MOMENT IN LGBT EQUALITY JOB TODAY THE BILL LOOK RECOGNIZED IN A FEDERAL FEDERAL CONGRESSIONAL PRIDE MONTH EVENT DUE YOU.

I STATED MY INTENT TO FIND A LONG TERM FUNDING SOLUTION FOR AIR AMBULANCE PROVIDERS AND I BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE FOUND A LONG TERM SOLUTION EMERGENCY AIR AMBULANCE PROVIDERS ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE STATEWIDE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES SYSTEM THEY ALSO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN HOMELAND SECURITY AND DISASTER RESPONSE INCLUDING THE EVACUATING OF HELP HOSPITALS IN THE PATH OF WILD FIRES AND RESPONDING TO THE COVERED NINETEEN CRISIS. EVERY YEAR THAT THE THAT THE PROVISIONS OF AMADA MUST BE EXTENDED CAUSES A GREAT DEAL OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY FOR AIR AMBULANCE PROVIDERS FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR DUE TO THE LEGISLATORS LIMITED ABILITY TO MEET BECAUSE OF COVERT NINETEEN RESTRICTIONS THE PROVISIONS OF AMADA EXPIRED AND THE PROVISIONS OF A MODEL WILL AGAIN EXPIRE TOMORROW. MEDI CAL AIR AMBULANCE RATES HAVE NOT BEEN INCREASED SINCE THEY WERE INITIALLY ESTABLISHED IN JULY NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND AS WITH OTHER EMERGENCY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS HAS PLACED AN ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC STRAIN ON PROVIDERS THUS ANY REDUCTION OF FUNDING PROVIDED BY AMADA AT THIS TIME WHAT I'M DOUBLY PLACE THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF MANY EMERGENCY HELICOPTER BASES AT RISK OF CLOSING PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS AND THOSE PROVIDING SERVICES TO CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS. WHO HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF MEDICAL UTILIZATION A. B.

THE GOAL OF THIS MEASURE IS TO IMPROVE PATIENT PROTECTIONS AND INCREASE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE FOR PATIENTS AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES SEEKING SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT A SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FACILITY OR RECOVERY RESIDENTS. MAINTAIN MINIMUM INSURANCE COVERAGE LEVELS THE LACK OF THIS REQUIREMENT PUTS PATIENTS AS WELL AS WORKERS AT RISK WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH INSURANCE COMMISSIONER LARA AND HIS TEAM ON THE SPELL AND HAPPY TO INTRODUCE FOR SUPPORT TESTIMONY.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR CANON MEMBERS OF THE CANADIAN MALLORY MICHAEL THAT THE LEDGER ACTOR HERE ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF BINGE THAT CALIFORNIA APARTMENT INSURANCE. AS A BILL SPONSORED MICHELLE ARE LIGHT THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THAT. MEASURE NOW LARA IS. AB ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT BECAUSE WE WANT TO ENSURE PROPER INSURANCE STANDARDS THAT. IN THE PAPER AND BUYING IT FOR CONSUMERS TO GET TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR STATE BEING ESPECIALLY DURING A TIME WHEN WE THOUGHT MORE CALIFORNIANS SPEAKING AT THE EVENT. DUE TO THE COLD THE NINETEENTH ENDEMIC. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON THE MEASURE THANK YOU. RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH I NOW WILL NOW MOVE ON TO SHERRY DALY FROM CALIFORNIA SOURCE FROM ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON OUR RETURN MEMBERS SHARE DAILY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS REPRESENTING OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY RECOVERY RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT CREEK CALIFORNIA. I AM HERE TODAY AS AN ENTHUSIASTIC ASK SUPPORTER OF THE AIMS OF AB ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT AM WHICH TO RESERVE A FORMAL POSITION WHILE RESOLVING POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH THE SIX THAT REFERENCES TO RECOVERY RESIDENCES. PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. I'M THE RECORD EST SPACE IT IS STILL QUITE COMMON PROPERTIES TO ATTEMPT TO FLY UNDER THE RADAR BY PURCHASING HOMEOWNER'S. OR RENTERS INSURANCE POLICIES WHERE THERE IS NO COMMERCIAL LIABILITY COVERAGE. AB ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT WOULD AND THIS UNETHICAL PRACTICE. THE NEED TO HAVE A PROBABLY LEVELS OF INSURANCE RECOVER RESIDENTS IS THREEFOLD FIRST IS IMPERATIVE THAT RESIDENTS BE PROTECTED SHOULD HARM COME TO THE MOP OR THEIR PROPERTY. SECOND IN ORDER FOR LANDLORDS TO TRUST OWNERS AND OPERATORS TO USE THEIR PROPERTIES FOR RECOVERY RESIDENTS OPERATIONS. THERE MUST BE SOME ASSURANCE THREE HEARD WITHIN THIS. BUT IF THERE'S PROPERTY DAMAGE OR ANY SORT OF ACCIDENT INCIDENT REQUIRING MEDICAL EXPENSES THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY WILL NOT BECOME THE DEEPEST POCKETS AND ANY ENSUING LAWSUIT THIRDLY AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY RECOVERY RESIDENTS CONTRACTING WITH COUNTIES SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO HOLD THE LEVELS OF INSURANCE DESIGNED DECIMATED THE BILL SO THEY DON'T LOSE IT SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE GOOD OPERATORS. WHICH WOULD LEAD TO A REDUCTION THE NUMBER OF HOMES AVAILABLE. AS AN EXAMPLE LAST YEAR WE HAD AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT AT ONE OF OUR CERTIFIED HOMES. ONE ONE RESIDENTS ATTACKED ANOTHER. FORTUNATELY THE OPERATOR VOLUNTARILY PURCHASE PROPER LEVELS OF INSURANCE THE VICTIM WAS COMPENSATED FOR HIS INJURIES THE OTHER INSURANCE PLANS.
