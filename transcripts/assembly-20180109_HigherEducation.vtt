00:41:26.884 --> 00:41:29.153 region:rollup2
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:31.155 region:rollup2
WOULD IMPACT A COLLECTIVE

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:32.857 region:rollup2
BARGAINING AGREEMENT PROCESS.

00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:34.025 region:rollup2
AND WHILE I WAS NOT EMPLOYEES.

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:35.860 region:rollup2
OF THE CSU NINETEEN NINETY SIX

00:41:34.025 --> 00:41:38.329 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:39.864 region:rollup2
I DO BELIEVE.

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:40.832 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY THE WAY THIS

00:41:39.864 --> 00:41:42.834 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR POT OF MONEY WAS

00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:44.802 region:rollup2
FUNDED.

00:41:42.834 --> 00:41:46.804 region:rollup2
WAS BY ALLOTMENT FROM THE STATE.

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:47.572 region:rollup2
THAT HAD TO GO AWAY DURING THE

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:50.641 region:rollup2
BUDGET CRISIS.

00:41:47.572 --> 00:41:52.210 region:rollup2
DURING THE NINETIES.

00:41:50.641 --> 00:41:54.679 region:rollup2
AT THAT POINT. I WAS CHOSEN

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:55.980 region:rollup2
UNITS.

00:41:54.679 --> 00:41:57.348 region:rollup2
THAT MADE THE DECISION TO ASK

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:59.217 region:rollup2
WOULD ASK TRADING HOUSES TO

00:41:57.348 --> 00:42:01.419 region:rollup2
RESCIND THAT ACTION.

00:41:59.217 --> 00:42:02.787 region:rollup2
WE ARE COURSE DO BELIEVE THAT

00:42:01.419 --> 00:42:04.288 region:rollup2
THERE HAS TO BE REINVESTMENT IN

00:42:02.787 --> 00:42:05.823 region:rollup2
OUR EMPLOYEES.

00:42:04.288 --> 00:42:07.125 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IS MERITED IN THE

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:08.626 region:rollup2
FACT THAT WE'VE HAD TODAY TEN

00:42:07.125 --> 00:42:10.194 region:rollup2
PERCENT SALARY CREASE FROM TWO

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:11.562 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FOURTEEN TWO THOUSAND

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:13.164 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN.

00:42:11.562 --> 00:42:14.399 region:rollup2
AND THEN AGAIN WE JUST SUPPORTED

00:42:13.164 --> 00:42:16.067 region:rollup2
EIGHTY NINE PERCENT SELLER

00:42:14.399 --> 00:42:17.602 region:rollup2
CREASE.

00:42:16.067 --> 00:42:18.770 region:rollup2
LITTLE GOLF ACT OF SEVENTEEN

00:42:17.602 --> 00:42:21.039 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:22.573 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY NOW BEYOND. ABOUT

00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:24.609 region:rollup2
A FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IT COST%

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:26.644 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM TO IMPLEMENT AVERELL

00:42:24.609 --> 00:42:27.845 region:rollup2
SUPPLY THAT TO SEE IF A AS WELL

00:42:26.644 --> 00:42:30.448 region:rollup2
AFFECT ASSOCIATION.

00:42:27.845 --> 00:42:31.416 region:rollup2
SO WE AGREE WITH THE DESIRE TO

00:42:30.448 --> 00:42:32.483 region:rollup2
ENSURE THE STRINGS THESE

00:42:31.416 --> 00:42:34.252 region:rollup2
APPOINTEES ARE COMPENSATED

00:42:32.483 --> 00:42:35.820 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY.

00:42:34.252 --> 00:42:37.889 region:rollup2
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:39.390 region:rollup2
OF THIS BILL HAVE.

00:42:37.889 --> 00:42:40.558 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD ONGOING WITHOUT

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.226 region:rollup2
ANY SORT INVEST FOR THE STATE TO

00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:44.595 region:rollup2
OFFSET THAT.

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:45.963 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE. NOW WHEN IT COMES TO

00:42:44.595 --> 00:42:47.498 region:rollup2
THE GUY ON THE PHONE THAT WAS

00:42:45.963 --> 00:42:48.466 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO THAT COULD BE TAPPED

00:42:47.498 --> 00:42:50.868 region:rollup2
INTO.

00:42:48.466 --> 00:42:52.303 region:rollup2
PER STATE LAW.

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:54.338 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS IN THE REVENUE THAT

00:42:52.303 --> 00:42:56.574 region:rollup2
ARE COLLECTED NO ARE REQUIRED TO

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:59.243 region:rollup2
BE USE FOR COUPLE FACILITY USES.

00:42:56.574 --> 00:43:01.379 region:rollup2
ONE TIME.

00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:03.114 region:rollup2
SO THERE THE AS THE LAW AS LET'S

00:43:01.379 --> 00:43:05.817 region:rollup2
ADDRESS FOR AS.

00:43:03.114 --> 00:43:07.819 region:rollup2
STARTED THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF

00:43:05.817 --> 00:43:09.720 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS AND HOW MAY BE USED

00:43:07.819 --> 00:43:10.488 region:rollup2
FOR SOME W. MUST BE OPPOSED.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:14.725 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

00:43:10.488 --> 00:43:16.260 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

00:43:14.725 --> 00:43:20.097 region:rollup2
ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:22.600 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE.

00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:23.234 region:rollup2
MR WENT.

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.170 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:43:23.234 --> 00:43:27.338 region:rollup2
MR MEDINA AND I I AM GOING TO

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:28.206 region:rollup2
BE SUPPORTING THE BILL I THINK

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:30.108 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT

00:43:28.206 --> 00:43:31.008 region:rollup2
PARITY THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:43:30.108 --> 00:43:33.177 region:rollup2
AND.

00:43:31.008 --> 00:43:34.812 region:rollup2
AND ALSO THE FACT THAT LONGTIME

00:43:33.177 --> 00:43:35.580 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES ARE ACTUALLY EARNING

00:43:34.812 --> 00:43:38.216 region:rollup2
LESS THAN.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:39.884 region:rollup2
NEW EMPLOYEES AT THE SAME RANGE

00:43:38.216 --> 00:43:41.119 region:rollup2
SO LIKE I SAID I I WILL BE

00:43:39.884 --> 00:43:43.287 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING THE BILL THAT I AM

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:45.423 region:rollup2
CONCERNED WITH PUTTING THIS INTO

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:46.724 region:rollup2
STATUE AND PUTTING THE AMOUNT

00:43:45.423 --> 00:43:48.226 region:rollup2
INTO STATUTE TO.

00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:49.494 region:rollup2
I THINK THESE.

00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:50.862 region:rollup2
.

00:43:49.494 --> 00:43:51.429 region:rollup2
THE SORT OF DECISION SHOULD BE

00:43:50.862 --> 00:43:52.964 region:rollup2
MADE AT THE BARGAINING TABLE

00:43:51.429 --> 00:43:54.298 region:rollup2
AND.

00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:56.601 region:rollup2
BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN

00:43:54.298 --> 00:43:58.536 region:rollup2
WAITING FOR. A DECADE TO GET

00:43:56.601 --> 00:44:00.872 region:rollup2
THAT DONE AND.

00:43:58.536 --> 00:44:03.541 region:rollup2
AND THAT CERTAINLY MAKES THAT

00:44:00.872 --> 00:44:05.576 region:rollup2
MAKES THINGS MUCH MORE.

00:44:03.541 --> 00:44:05.776 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT AND AND I THINK THAT

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:07.278 region:rollup2
DOES.

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:09.814 region:rollup2
.

00:44:07.278 --> 00:44:11.682 region:rollup2
REQUIRE THE LEGISLATURE TO TO

00:44:09.814 --> 00:44:13.151 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT STEP SELF. A AGAIN

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:15.553 region:rollup2
WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THAT

00:44:13.151 --> 00:44:17.855 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BE WARY ABOUT THE.

00:44:15.553 --> 00:44:20.791 region:rollup2
LOSS OF BUDGET FLEXIBILITY IN A

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:22.293 region:rollup2
DOWNTURN.

00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:24.629 region:rollup2
THIS BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER

00:44:22.293 --> 00:44:25.930 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN I'M. JUST AT.

00:44:24.629 --> 00:44:27.298 region:rollup2
TRY TO UNDERSTAND IF I RECALL IN

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:29.500 region:rollup2
THE FALL THERE'D BEEN AN

00:44:27.298 --> 00:44:31.269 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT FOR AYE NINE PERCENT

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.970 region:rollup2
PAY INCREASE OVER THREE YEARS

00:44:31.269 --> 00:44:34.906 region:rollup2
FIVE REMEMBER THAT QUICKLY.

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:36.240 region:rollup2
DOES THAT COVER DIFFERENT.

00:44:34.906 --> 00:44:38.242 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES ARE CLASSIFICATIONS

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.711 region:rollup2
THIS ON TOP OF THAT NINE PERCENT

00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:41.979 region:rollup2
PAY INCREASE IF THIS PASSES WHAT

00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:42.780 region:rollup2
IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT

00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:43.948 region:rollup2
PAY INCREASE THAT I THINK WAS

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.615 region:rollup2
PART OF COLOR

00:44:43.948 --> 00:44:46.717 region:rollup2
THE BARGAINING NEGOTIATIONS AND

00:44:44.615 --> 00:44:48.586 region:rollup2
THE S..

00:44:46.717 --> 00:44:49.654 region:rollup2
STEPPING INCREASES ARE DIFFERENT

00:44:48.586 --> 00:44:50.521 region:rollup2
THAN AND THEN MOVE THEN RAISES

00:44:49.654 --> 00:44:52.089 region:rollup2
IS WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:53.691 region:rollup2
INCREASES STEPPING CREASES TALK

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:55.226 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THE STRUCTURE OF THE

00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:56.561 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION EXIST.

00:44:55.226 --> 00:44:57.995 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE ENTER AT A CERTAIN

00:44:56.561 --> 00:44:59.430 region:rollup2
LEVEL IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL THEY

00:44:57.995 --> 00:45:00.965 region:rollup2
MOVE UP THE LADDER WITH BEEN

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:02.233 region:rollup2
THEIR CLASSIFICATION WHEN YOU

00:45:00.965 --> 00:45:04.502 region:rollup2
GET A PAY INCREASE IT GOES

00:45:02.233 --> 00:45:05.536 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE BOARD. AND SO

00:45:04.502 --> 00:45:06.470 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY GETS THAT SO THIS

00:45:05.536 --> 00:45:08.406 region:rollup2
WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:10.441 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE WOULD GET BUT A STEP

00:45:08.406 --> 00:45:12.043 region:rollup2
INCREASE IT TALKS ABOUT HOW YOU

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:13.811 region:rollup2
PROGRESS IN THE FIELD AND IN THE

00:45:12.043 --> 00:45:15.413 region:rollup2
AREA WHERE YOU ARE. WITHOUT A

00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:16.814 region:rollup2
STEP INCREASE EVERYTHING JUST

00:45:15.413 --> 00:45:18.683 region:rollup2
THIS KIND OF FLOAT AROUND IN

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:20.284 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATING AMONG INDIVIDUALS

00:45:18.683 --> 00:45:22.587 region:rollup2
VERSUS UNDERSTANDING HOW YOU

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:24.488 region:rollup2
MOVE UP THE LADDER. AND EVERY

00:45:22.587 --> 00:45:26.357 region:rollup2
OTHER STATE AGENCY HAS THAT

00:45:24.488 --> 00:45:28.226 region:rollup2
LATTER THAT'S DEVELOPED IN THE

00:45:26.357 --> 00:45:29.827 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE SO THAT WHEN WE IF

00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:31.729 region:rollup2
THEY IF THEY'RE AT STEP ONE THEY

00:45:29.827 --> 00:45:33.231 region:rollup2
GO TO THE GO TO THREE. AND IF

00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:34.332 region:rollup2
THE AGENCY OR THE STATE COMES

00:45:33.231 --> 00:45:35.533 region:rollup2
AND GIVES A FIVE PERCENT RAISE

00:45:34.332 --> 00:45:38.236 region:rollup2
ECHOES ACROSS THE BOARD BUT THE

00:45:35.533 --> 00:45:39.937 region:rollup2
STEPS REMAIN. IN PLACE AND SO IT

00:45:38.236 --> 00:45:42.807 region:rollup2
REALLY IS ABOUT HOW YOU DEVELOP

00:45:39.937 --> 00:45:44.442 region:rollup2
A CAREER PATTERN OR LATTER TO A

00:45:42.807 --> 00:45:45.710 region:rollup2
TOAST AS PEOPLE WORK IN A FIELD

00:45:44.442 --> 00:45:47.345 region:rollup2
AVAIL JUST REMAIN IN THE SAME

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:49.547 region:rollup2
SALARY. AND THEN GET EVERYBODY

00:45:47.345 --> 00:45:50.982 region:rollup2
GETS IT INCREASE ITS TALK ABOUT

00:45:49.547 --> 00:45:52.783 region:rollup2
BASICALLY A STEP IN THE

00:45:50.982 --> 00:45:54.452 region:rollup2
PROFESSION AND MOVING UP WITHIN

00:45:52.783 --> 00:45:55.319 region:rollup2
THE CATEGORY WHICH RIGS YOU

00:45:54.452 --> 00:45:56.153 region:rollup2
EXIST.

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:57.355 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THAT SYSTEM FOR MANY

00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:59.890 region:rollup2
MANY YEARS.

00:45:57.355 --> 00:46:01.225 region:rollup2
AND THEN IT WOULD AWAY A WE

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:02.526 region:rollup2
HAVE PUT IN STACKS WHO NOW FOR

00:46:01.225 --> 00:46:04.195 region:rollup2
THE FACULTY TO HAVE STEP

00:46:02.526 --> 00:46:05.463 region:rollup2
INCREASES AGAIN A BECAUSE THAT

00:46:04.195 --> 00:46:07.265 region:rollup2
WAS TAKEN AWAY WHEN I WAS THERE

00:46:05.463 --> 00:46:09.233 region:rollup2
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT. OF THE

00:46:07.265 --> 00:46:11.135 region:rollup2
MORALE ISSUE IS VERY LOW WHEN IT

00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:12.903 region:rollup2
COMES TO NOT UNDERSTANDING THE

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:14.805 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE OF THE INSTITUTION HOW

00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:16.207 region:rollup2
YOU MOVE IN AND HOW YOU MOVE UP

00:46:14.805 --> 00:46:18.109 region:rollup2
WITH AND CATEGORIES OF RIGHTS OR

00:46:16.207 --> 00:46:20.244 region:rollup2
WHATEVER IT MAY BE. BECAUSE

00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:21.879 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE A RIGHT NOW.

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:22.680 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND SO BASICALLY

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:26.350 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CHEERING STEPPING

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:28.252 region:rollup2
COLUMNS AND EXACTLY OKAY. AND SO

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:29.887 region:rollup2
THIS IS ESSENTIALLY ON TOP OF A

00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:31.455 region:rollup2
NINE PERCENT PAY INCREASE THE

00:46:29.887 --> 00:46:33.224 region:rollup2
BABY HAS BEEN NEGOTIATED.

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:35.126 region:rollup2
THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

00:46:33.224 --> 00:46:36.427 region:rollup2
EXACTLY.

00:46:35.126 --> 00:46:37.828 region:rollup2
I HAVE THAT'S HELPFUL NOW I I

00:46:36.427 --> 00:46:38.462 region:rollup2
SHARE THE CONCERNS ARE GOOD

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:40.765 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE.

MEMBER IRWIN IT'S LED ME TO A

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:46.771 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CONCLUSION BECAUSE I

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:48.906 region:rollup2
JUST FIND IT IS SO RIGID AND I'M

00:46:46.771 --> 00:46:50.074 region:rollup2
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT REGIONALLY

00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:51.876 region:rollup2
MANDATING.

00:46:50.074 --> 00:46:53.844 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WITH CS YOU

00:46:51.876 --> 00:46:55.413 region:rollup2
I I HOPE THAT THERE CAN BE A

00:46:53.844 --> 00:46:56.047 region:rollup2
PERSON I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN

00:46:55.413 --> 00:46:57.915 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE ALLOWS NINE MORE

00:46:56.047 --> 00:46:59.183 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY BUT. THIS TO BE PART

00:46:57.915 --> 00:47:00.484 region:rollup2
OF THAT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:01.852 region:rollup2
PROCESS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE

AND YOU KNOW MOST YEARS DOES NOT

00:49:34.605 --> 00:49:39.677 region:rollup2
INVEST ENOUGH IN OUR SYSTEMS OF

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:41.879 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION. AT A TIME WHEN

00:49:39.677 --> 00:49:43.681 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FOR YEARS NOT EVEN

00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:45.816 region:rollup2
PROVIDED ENOUGH SEATS FOR

00:49:43.681 --> 00:49:47.384 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT QUALIFY. TO GO TO

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:48.953 region:rollup2
A CSU OR ANY OF THE OTHER

SYSTEMS.

00:49:48.953 --> 00:49:52.890 region:rollup2
AND I IN AN AIR OF UNCERTAINTY

00:49:51.622 --> 00:49:54.792 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE AN ECONOMY.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:57.695 region:rollup2
WHERE WE'VE GOT A STOCK MARKET

00:49:54.792 --> 00:50:01.232 region:rollup2
ON STEROIDS AND FEDERAL FISCAL

00:49:57.695 --> 00:50:03.200 region:rollup2
POLICY IS GOING TO POP?

00:50:01.232 --> 00:50:05.236 region:rollup2
AND THE STATE'S BUDGET.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.004 region:rollup2
NEVER SURVIVES

00:50:05.236 --> 00:50:09.840 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

00:50:07.004 --> 00:50:11.742 region:rollup2
INELEGANT WAY IT'S WERE THICK

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:14.278 region:rollup2
AND THE CUTS ARE AWFUL IT'S SO

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:15.746 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY DO WE THEN. INCREASE

00:50:14.278 --> 00:50:18.515 region:rollup2

THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:50:27.625 --> 00:50:32.463 region:rollup2
IT'S DIRE

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:34.899 region:rollup2
AND SO. WE ARE AT THIS.

00:50:32.463 --> 00:50:36.667 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS PEAK.

00:50:34.899 --> 00:50:38.469 region:rollup2
FOR OUR STATE BUDGET.

00:50:36.667 --> 00:50:39.737 region:rollup2
THAT I CAN SEE OVER THE OTHER

00:50:38.469 --> 00:50:41.438 region:rollup2
SIDE.

00:50:39.737 --> 00:50:43.407 region:rollup2
AND IT GOES DOWN

00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:44.174 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T KEEP GOING UP.

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:46.610 region:rollup2
AND.

00:50:44.174 --> 00:50:48.312 region:rollup2

IN.

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:29.453 region:rollup2
MY PREVIOUS LIFE.

00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:31.155 region:rollup2
OF.

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:32.756 region:rollup2
THERE STEP PROCESS IS FOLLOWED

00:51:31.155 --> 00:51:33.991 region:rollup2
IN THE.

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:35.826 region:rollup2
AND THE DEPARTMENT IN FEDERAL

00:51:33.991 --> 00:51:39.129 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT ALL THE TIME.

00:51:35.826 --> 00:51:40.564 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COME AT A CERTAIN LEVEL.

00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:42.232 region:rollup2
AND THE MILITARY GOOD.

00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:43.634 region:rollup2
DOD THEIR.

00:51:42.232 --> 00:51:45.536 region:rollup2
GS LEVELS THREE FOUR FIVE SIX

00:51:43.634 --> 00:51:47.404 region:rollup2
SEVEN EIGHT NINE.

00:51:45.536 --> 00:51:49.039 region:rollup2
AND YOU HAVE STEPS WITHIN THEM

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:52.142 region:rollup2
INSTEAD FOR DESIGN.

00:51:49.039 --> 00:51:53.344 region:rollup2
AS A RECOGNITION.

00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:55.212 region:rollup2
BUT THE THAT'S WHERE TO SET A

00:51:53.344 --> 00:51:57.581 region:rollup2
PERSON HAS AT A CERTAIN JOBS OF

00:51:55.212 --> 00:51:58.882 region:rollup2
A JOB IS RATED. AND IT YEAR

00:51:57.581 --> 00:52:00.117 region:rollup2
SEVEN OR EIGHT.

00:51:58.882 --> 00:52:02.419 region:rollup2
THIS STEP RECOGNIZES LONGEVITY

00:52:00.117 --> 00:52:05.122 region:rollup2
THEIR.

00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:08.759 region:rollup2
SO THE QUESTION THE AUTHOR IS.

00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:10.661 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE IN DOD THE STEPS ARE.

00:52:08.759 --> 00:52:11.929 region:rollup2
TWO OR THREE YEARS YOU HAVE TO

00:52:10.661 --> 00:52:13.364 region:rollup2
BE IN A JOB BEFORE YOU REACH

00:52:11.929 --> 00:52:15.699 region:rollup2
OTHER STEP WHAT YOU'RE

00:52:13.364 --> 00:52:16.967 region:rollup2
ENVISIONING OF THIS.

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:18.535 region:rollup2
IS THAT EVERYYEAR TO YEAR EVERY

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:20.738 region:rollup2
THREE YEAR.

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:21.739 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'D GO FOR THE STEP.

00:52:20.738 --> 00:52:23.907 region:rollup2
YOU'RE IN HERE JUST STEP

00:52:21.739 --> 00:52:25.542 region:rollup2
INCREASES BASED ON MERIT ANY

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:26.443 region:rollup2
VALUATION RIGHT BUT WHEN WOULD

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:28.245 region:rollup2
THAT COME FORWARD.

00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:29.446 region:rollup2
BUT PART.

00:52:28.245 --> 00:52:30.881 region:rollup2
A A MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S THE

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:32.349 region:rollup2
ANNUAL IT USED TO BE ANNUAL.

00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:33.684 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ANNUAL INCREASES AND

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:35.019 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WAS WHAT THE THAT'S

00:52:33.684 --> 00:52:36.553 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THEIR

00:52:35.019 --> 00:52:38.088 region:rollup2
ANNUAL INCREASES BUT THEY'RE

00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:39.723 region:rollup2
BASED STRICTLY UPON MERIT. THAT

00:52:38.088 --> 00:52:41.525 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO HAVE POSITIVE

00:52:39.723 --> 00:52:42.993 region:rollup2
EVALUATION GOOD EVALUATION TO

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:44.461 region:rollup2
MOVE TO THE NEXT STEP PROVINCE

00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:45.996 region:rollup2
WE GET TO THE TOP OF THE LADDER

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:47.865 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY AS YOU KNOW AND THEN

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:49.066 region:rollup2
AT THAT POINT YOU HAVE TO. DO

00:52:47.865 --> 00:52:50.934 region:rollup2
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY TO VOTE

00:52:49.066 --> 00:52:53.103 region:rollup2
TOOK TO TRANSITION TO THE NEXT

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:54.304 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF ANOTHER NET ALLOW THEM

00:52:53.103 --> 00:52:55.639 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE LETTER WHEN SHE REACHED

00:52:54.304 --> 00:52:57.341 region:rollup2
THE TOP. BUT.

00:52:55.639 --> 00:52:58.909 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S SIMILAR TO THE FITS

STATE DOES IT EVERY YEAR OKAY

00:53:00.678 --> 00:53:04.548 region:rollup2
IT'S EVERY YEAR BASED ON MERIT

00:53:01.879 --> 00:53:05.883 region:rollup2
IN A REQUIRES AN EVALUATION BY

00:53:04.548 --> 00:53:07.351 region:rollup2
OTHER.

00:53:05.883 --> 00:53:09.420 region:rollup2
BY THEIR SENIOR TO GIVE THEM A

00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:10.988 region:rollup2
FAVOR VALUATION THAT PLACE UP

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:12.890 region:rollup2
MIA AND THAT'S A STEP IN NOW. AS

00:53:10.988 --> 00:53:14.124 region:rollup2
FAR AS I HAVE A LETTER HERE THE

00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:16.326 region:rollup2
SAME ONE THAT THE.

00:53:14.124 --> 00:53:17.561 region:rollup2
.

00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:19.129 region:rollup2
DID YOU MENTIONED EARLIER AS FAR

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:19.730 region:rollup2
AS A NINE PERCENT OVER THREE

00:53:19.129 --> 00:53:20.698 region:rollup2
YEARS WAS TWO PERCENT A YEAR

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:22.332 region:rollup2
WHOM THE.

00:53:20.698 --> 00:53:23.167 region:rollup2
.

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:24.034 region:rollup2
QUESTION DIRECTLY MORE TO YOU

00:53:23.167 --> 00:53:24.201 region:rollup2
SIR.

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:26.804 region:rollup2
IS.

00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:27.805 region:rollup2
.

00:53:26.804 --> 00:53:28.872 region:rollup2
PUTTING THE NINE PERCENT BECAUSE

00:53:27.805 --> 00:53:30.441 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING NEGOTIATED WITH

00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:31.875 region:rollup2
DEALS WITH.

00:53:30.441 --> 00:53:33.310 region:rollup2
BUDGET AND ECONOMICS AND ALL THE

00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:34.578 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WORKED ENTERED INTO

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:36.513 region:rollup2
THIS WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:37.981 region:rollup2
SEPARATE FROM THE STEP. IS THIS

00:53:36.513 --> 00:53:40.818 region:rollup2
TO ME IS A.

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:41.952 region:rollup2
AND HR MANAGEMENT POSITION THAT

00:53:40.818 --> 00:53:44.988 region:rollup2

TEACHER. IMPROVEMENTS SO REWARD

00:53:44.988 --> 00:53:49.760 region:rollup2
THEM FOR THEIR EXPERIENCE AFTER

00:53:47.424 --> 00:53:52.463 region:rollup2
A TRIAL VALUATION.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:53.797 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT NOW.

00:53:52.463 --> 00:53:55.132 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IS STRICTLY FROM THE

00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:56.667 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF AN INDIVIDUAL

00:53:55.132 --> 00:53:57.868 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THEIR EXPERTISE

00:53:56.667 --> 00:53:58.469 region:rollup2
IT'S BASED ON WHAT THE FUNDING

00:53:57.868 --> 00:54:00.571 region:rollup2
IS RIGHT IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO

00:53:58.469 --> 00:54:02.306 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:04.274 region:rollup2
THAT TO YOU YOUR ARGUMENT WOULD

00:54:02.306 --> 00:54:04.842 region:rollup2
BE SUPPORTING WHAT WAS

00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:06.110 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED EARLIER ABOUT THE

00:54:04.842 --> 00:54:07.211 region:rollup2
ECONOMY.

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:10.013 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM

00:54:07.211 --> 00:54:12.749 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING HOW DO YOU DEVELOP A

00:54:10.013 --> 00:54:14.818 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE TO WELL PROVIDE THE

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:17.354 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE THAT'S REQUIRED IN IN

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:19.256 region:rollup2
RUNNING THE. DNC TWO SHIFTS WALL

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:20.591 region:rollup2
AGAIN THIS IS THIS HAS AS MUCH

00:54:19.256 --> 00:54:21.992 region:rollup2
OF ANALYSIS AND BY THOSE THE

00:54:20.591 --> 00:54:23.794 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS IS BEEN IN THE PLACE

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:26.096 region:rollup2
FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS NOW THIS.

00:54:23.794 --> 00:54:27.197 region:rollup2
IS THAT WHAT THE PROCEDURE IS.

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:30.067 region:rollup2
.

00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:31.301 region:rollup2
IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS.

00:54:30.067 --> 00:54:32.169 region:rollup2
DESIRED AS PART OF THE

00:54:31.301 --> 00:54:34.104 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATION PROCESS THE

00:54:32.169 --> 00:54:34.671 region:rollup2
CLUTTERED MARKET PROCESS IF A

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:35.606 region:rollup2
STEP IS THE WAY TO GO THAT I

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:36.974 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:54:35.606 --> 00:54:38.075 region:rollup2
FRANKLY THAT'S SHOULD BE

00:54:36.974 --> 00:54:39.776 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED OUT THE TABLE AND

00:54:38.075 --> 00:54:40.244 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE.

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:42.646 region:rollup2
TAKEN AWAY.

00:54:40.244 --> 00:54:43.147 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE PART THE GIVE AND

00:54:42.646 --> 00:54:44.047 region:rollup2
TAKE IS PARTLY GESTATION

00:54:43.147 --> 00:54:45.783 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:54:44.047 --> 00:54:47.151 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE DO HAVE FUNDS

00:54:45.783 --> 00:54:48.619 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FOR A MERIT STEP

00:54:47.151 --> 00:54:49.253 region:rollup2
INCREASE SPEED PRIDE IN THE

00:54:48.619 --> 00:54:50.420 region:rollup2
BUDGET WE DO PROVIDE THAT YOU'RE

00:54:49.253 --> 00:54:52.055 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:53.090 region:rollup2
BUT A FORMULA BE SOMETHING THAT

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:54.658 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE THAT PER SE WE

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:56.426 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ALLOTMENT. IN THE

00:54:54.658 --> 00:54:56.960 region:rollup2
BUDGET YEAR TO YEAR.

00:54:56.426 --> 00:54:57.794 region:rollup2
BUT YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.897 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:54:57.794 --> 00:55:02.099 region:rollup2
PAY.

00:54:59.897 --> 00:55:02.699 region:rollup2
THE DIM NEGOTIATE THREE PERCENT

00:55:02.099 --> 00:55:04.568 region:rollup2
A YEAR IS FOR THREE YEARS NOW

00:55:02.699 --> 00:55:06.637 region:rollup2
ABSENT. THAT'S RIGHT LOOKING AT

00:55:04.568 --> 00:55:08.372 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMIC REALITY OF THE

00:55:06.637 --> 00:55:10.574 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION IN ITS ENTIRETY.

00:55:08.372 --> 00:55:12.109 region:rollup2
STEP.

00:55:10.574 --> 00:55:14.011 region:rollup2
IS DESIGNED TO LOOK AT THE

00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:15.846 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:18.682 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE AND THE JOB TO DO AND

00:55:15.846 --> 00:55:20.951 region:rollup2
IT'S MORE OF AN H. R..

00:55:18.682 --> 00:55:23.120 region:rollup2
SYSTEM TO.

00:55:20.951 --> 00:55:24.288 region:rollup2
SO THAT PEOPLE PRODUCE BETTER

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:26.056 region:rollup2
DATE THESE SEE AN UPWARD

00:55:24.288 --> 00:55:27.858 region:rollup2
MOBILITY THEY LEARN NEW SKILLS

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:28.926 region:rollup2
TO DO BETTER THAT'S DIFFERENT

00:55:27.858 --> 00:55:31.128 region:rollup2
AND PAIN PEOPLE DON THE ECONOMY

00:55:28.926 --> 00:55:32.296 region:rollup2
IT'S LOOK AT. HOW DO YOU MANAGE

00:55:31.128 --> 00:55:34.498 region:rollup2
YOUR WORKFORCE

00:55:32.296 --> 00:55:36.400 region:rollup2
SO ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT THE

00:55:34.498 --> 00:55:38.769 region:rollup2

MANAGE A REWARD YOUR WORKFORCE

00:55:38.769 --> 00:55:42.339 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY. ON THE PERCENT

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:44.641 region:rollup2
INCREASE NOT ON THE OF VALUATION

00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:45.709 region:rollup2
AND PERFORMANCE.

00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:46.310 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT

00:55:45.709 --> 00:55:47.845 region:rollup2
THINGS IS THAT WE ARE TELLING

00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:49.713 region:rollup2
ME.

00:55:47.845 --> 00:55:51.982 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE THE SALARY

THE INCREASE ON THE ECONOMY

00:56:26.016 --> 00:56:29.620 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:32.856 region:rollup2
HAVING WORKED IN THIS

00:58:26.036 --> 00:58:29.773 region:rollup2
CONDUCT AND ACTIVITY BASED

00:58:28.138 --> 00:58:30.907 region:rollup2
COSTING TO LOOK AND SEE HOW THEY

00:58:29.773 --> 00:58:32.109 region:rollup2
CAN BE MORE EFFICIENT AS AN

00:58:30.907 --> 00:58:34.544 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION.

00:58:32.109 --> 00:58:36.146 region:rollup2
AND THESE EXACT PEOPLE WHO WHO

00:58:34.544 --> 00:58:37.114 region:rollup2
DO WE ARE TRAINED TO DO THIS

00:58:36.146 --> 00:58:38.749 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THE ONE TO TELL YOU HOW

00:58:37.114 --> 00:58:39.750 region:rollup2
TO FIND EFFICIENCY.

00:58:38.749 --> 00:58:41.151 region:rollup2
TO ME THAT WOULD BE A BETTER

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:42.853 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT THAN FIGURING THAT

00:58:41.151 --> 00:58:43.453 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO JUST TAKE IT SO

00:58:42.853 --> 00:58:45.255 region:rollup2
MUCH MONEY IT'S GOING TO PACK

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:47.290 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS FOR. TO ME THAT'S A

00:58:45.255 --> 00:58:48.759 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ARGUMENT THIS IS MORE

00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:51.261 region:rollup2
OF AN HR ISSUE.

00:58:48.759 --> 00:58:52.662 region:rollup2
SO AS I SAID EARLIER IF.

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:53.263 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE GOT SOMETIME BEFORE

00:58:52.662 --> 00:58:54.531 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA BE ON THE FLOOR BUT

00:58:53.263 --> 00:58:56.933 region:rollup2
AS A.

00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:58.101 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY IS WHERE THE SYSTEM.

00:58:56.933 --> 00:59:00.771 region:rollup2
AND HONORED STANDING DIFFERENCE

00:58:58.101 --> 00:59:02.539 region:rollup2
BETWEEN STEP IN HR RELATIONSHIPS

00:59:00.771 --> 00:59:04.207 region:rollup2
AND UNDERSTANDING MAKING BUDGETS

00:59:02.539 --> 00:59:06.043 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:08.011 region:rollup2
OKAY THEY DO COME ALIVE BUT

00:59:06.043 --> 00:59:10.147 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:11.548 region:rollup2
THAT AND AND THAT'S WHY.

00:59:10.147 --> 00:59:13.483 region:rollup2
KAREN HANGS A PRESIDENT CAL

00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:14.951 region:rollup2
STATE SAN MARCOS IN THE HIVE IN

00:59:13.483 --> 00:59:17.053 region:rollup2
THE HIVE WHITE ALL THESE GUYS

00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:18.321 region:rollup2
GETPAID THE BIG BUCKS TO FIGURE

00:59:17.053 --> 00:59:19.523 region:rollup2
OUT HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK.

00:59:18.321 --> 00:59:21.725 region:rollup2
SO AS I SAID I'M GOING TO

00:59:19.523 --> 00:59:23.126 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS.

00:59:21.725 --> 00:59:24.828 region:rollup2
HE GOT REPUBLICANS BOY NAY ON

00:59:23.126 --> 00:59:26.930 region:rollup2
THIS THING ABOUT THAT.

00:59:24.828 --> 00:59:28.098 region:rollup2
BUT I'M GOING TO ALSO.

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:29.933 region:rollup2
WAIT UNTIL ICE YOU COME ACROSS

00:59:28.098 --> 00:59:31.334 region:rollup2
THE FLOOR.

00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:32.769 region:rollup2
IF I HAVE SO MANY CAN GET TO

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:34.204 region:rollup2
MUNICH SPYING TO ME. HOW THEY'RE

00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:35.439 region:rollup2
GOING TO TAKE CARE ARE PEOPLE

00:59:34.204 --> 00:59:37.140 region:rollup2
WHO ARE WORKING FOR STATE AND

00:59:35.439 --> 00:59:37.841 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMEBODY WORK IN THE SAME

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:40.277 region:rollup2
POSITION?

00:59:37.841 --> 00:59:42.679 region:rollup2
FOR TEN YEARS.

00:59:40.277 --> 00:59:43.547 region:rollup2
AND NEVER BE INCREASED AS PAY.

00:59:42.679 --> 00:59:47.551 region:rollup2
TO ME IS.

00:59:43.547 --> 00:59:51.888 region:rollup2
ROTH.

00:59:47.551 --> 00:59:52.522 region:rollup2
AND I HAD HAD SOMETHING TO THAT.

00:59:51.888 --> 00:59:54.858 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER QUICK SO

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:56.226 region:rollup2
IT.

00:59:54.858 --> 00:59:58.228 region:rollup2
YOU YOU AND IT. O. I I GET

00:59:56.226 --> 00:59:59.863 region:rollup2
DURING MY PROGRESSION AS I

00:59:58.228 --> 01:00:00.597 region:rollup2
PROGRESSED THROUGH THE SERIES.

00:59:59.863 --> 01:00:02.265 region:rollup2
I HAVE THREE.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:04.401 region:rollup2
UNDERGRADS IN MATHEMATICS

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:06.369 region:rollup2
SCIENCE AND BIOLOGY AND AS I

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:07.904 region:rollup2
PROGRESSED THROUGH THE CSU. I

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:08.872 region:rollup2
PICKED UP AN MBA I PICKED OF A

01:00:07.904 --> 01:00:10.440 region:rollup2
MASTERS IN INTERNATIONAL

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:13.110 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT EVERYTHING THEY ASKED

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:15.612 region:rollup2
ME TO DO. TO HELP OUT WITH THE

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:17.013 region:rollup2
RUNNING THE SYSTEM HELPING OUT

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:18.281 region:rollup2
MY ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT.

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:19.316 region:rollup2
PAID OUT OF MY OWN POCKET

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:22.452 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:24.855 region:rollup2
HE STAYED THE SAME.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:25.856 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MR SANTIAGO.

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:26.823 region:rollup2
THINK MISTER TURNOUT LOOK AT

01:00:25.856 --> 01:00:28.191 region:rollup2
THIS BILL FROM FROM A DIFFERENT

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:29.192 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE AYE I ONCE WAS THE

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:30.760 region:rollup2
PRESENT A LARGE COMMUNITY

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:34.197 region:rollup2
COLLEGE DISTRICT.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:35.031 region:rollup2
IN THE U. S. AND. WE WE ALSO

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:37.167 region:rollup2
RAN TO THE SIMILAR PROBLEMS.

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:39.302 region:rollup2
SORRY.

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:42.272 region:rollup2
A SOLID STEP SCALE AND A

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:43.874 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT NUMBER ACTUALLY HOPES

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:44.808 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION IN A NUMBER OF WAYS.

01:00:43.874 --> 01:00:46.877 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE ITS LONG TERM BUDGET

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:48.912 region:rollup2
PLAN.

01:00:46.877 --> 01:00:50.614 region:rollup2
NUMBER TWO WHICH WE FOUND OUT

01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:52.015 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME WERE DEFICIENT AND

01:00:50.614 --> 01:00:54.117 region:rollup2
HAVING SUPERVISORS.

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:54.718 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DO EVALUATIONS FOLLOW

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:56.353 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

01:00:54.718 --> 01:00:58.155 region:rollup2
EXCITED BECAUSE OFTENTIMES IN

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:59.389 region:rollup2
THESE LARGE INSTITUTIONS.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:01.124 region:rollup2
I'M NOT AN EXPERT OF YOUR

01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:02.893 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION BUT I CAN TELL YOU

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:04.394 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WERE AT. THE A ONE OF

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:06.663 region:rollup2
THE PLANS WE HAD.

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:08.131 region:rollup2
WAS THAT WOULD THE MANAGEMENT

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:10.800 region:rollup2
WAS NOT DOING EVALUATIONS.

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:12.869 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE BREEZES ONE

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.470 region:rollup2
HAPPENING AND THEREFORE

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.504 region:rollup2
PREDICTED HE WAS A LITTLE BIT

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:15.972 region:rollup2
LOWER TO.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:17.474 region:rollup2
BUT IT ALSO FORCES AN

01:01:15.972 --> 01:01:18.475 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION TO DO DO SALLY

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:20.777 region:rollup2
SURVEYS RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HAVE

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:21.344 region:rollup2
TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHETHER WHAT

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:23.346 region:rollup2
INST OTHER INSTITUTIONS ARE

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:24.347 region:rollup2
PAYING.

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:25.415 region:rollup2
AND IN THAT HELPS TO RETAIN

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:27.651 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES NOW.

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:28.451 region:rollup2
I WILL SAY THIS BILL TO.

01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:30.620 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TOOLS IN AN

01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:32.389 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION HAS EVEN IF THIS WAS

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:34.257 region:rollup2
SET IN STONE.

01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:35.825 region:rollup2
OF THAT COULD BE OFF RAMPS THE

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:36.826 region:rollup2
TOUGH BUDGET TIMES BECAUSE WE

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:37.727 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT THAT AS WELL RIGHT

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:39.329 region:rollup2
THERE'S. IN CONTRACT

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:40.397 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATIONS YOU CAN GO TIME AND

01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:42.198 region:rollup2
MOTION STUDY THAT WOULD MAKE AN

01:01:40.397 --> 01:01:43.300 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION MORE EFFICIENT.

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:45.635 region:rollup2
AND THE INSTITUTION JUST HAS TO

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:46.503 region:rollup2
BE CREATIVE ABOUT HOW ABOUT HOW

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:47.938 region:rollup2
IT APPROACHES IT ITS CONTRACT

01:01:46.503 --> 01:01:49.406 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATIONS.

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:50.473 region:rollup2
OTHERS ALSO LAYOFFS AND

01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:51.975 region:rollup2
FURLOUGHS I MEAN THAT THERE'S A

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:53.009 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF THINGS IN AN

01:01:51.975 --> 01:01:53.710 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION CAN DO THAT ARE THAT

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:56.046 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:57.347 region:rollup2
MAYBE NOT POPULAR TO THE FOLK

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:59.749 region:rollup2
FROM THE STABLE BUT THERE ARE

01:01:57.347 --> 01:02:00.550 region:rollup2
OFFERING AMPS UP THE BUDGET. THE

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:01.685 region:rollup2
BUDGET DECLINES IN THE

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:03.053 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S DONE AND

01:02:01.685 --> 01:02:04.454 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS THAT I KNOW BECAUSE

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:05.989 region:rollup2
I WAS IN A PLACE WHERE WHO DO

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:07.290 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT.

01:02:05.989 --> 01:02:09.159 region:rollup2
A LAYOFF SOME FURLOUGHS AT A

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:10.994 region:rollup2
TIME WHEN WHEN WE WERE GOING

01:02:09.159 --> 01:02:13.396 region:rollup2
INTO A REALLY TOUGH UP BUDGET

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:14.531 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS AT THE STATE. SO THAT

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:16.399 region:rollup2
IS SO I JUST WANT CERTAINLY

01:02:14.531 --> 01:02:17.300 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO OUR OFF RAMPS

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:19.269 region:rollup2
ON AND THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY A

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.604 region:rollup2
BAD A.

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:22.472 region:rollup2
AND THINK THE I MEAN IT WE WILL

01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:23.373 region:rollup2
RUIN AN INSTITUTION. THERE ARE

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.374 region:rollup2
THINGS IN THIS ISSUE CAN DO

01:02:23.373 --> 01:02:26.142 region:rollup2
AGAIN OP PRESS UPON THE

01:02:24.374 --> 01:02:28.345 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION AND LOVE THE LAST

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:28.745 region:rollup2
pPOINT REALLY IS. FOLKS COME TO

01:02:28.345 --> 01:02:30.747 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE.

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:32.315 region:rollup2
.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:33.617 region:rollup2
AND SEEKTHE SORT OF SOLUTIONS

01:02:32.315 --> 01:02:35.385 region:rollup2
WHEN ALL ELSE FAILED.

01:02:33.617 --> 01:02:36.286 region:rollup2
I MEAN I I TRUST

01:02:35.385 --> 01:02:37.387 region:rollup2
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:39.022 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE IF A

01:02:37.387 --> 01:02:40.790 region:rollup2
CONTRACT IF THE BARGAINING TABLE

01:02:39.022 --> 01:02:42.559 region:rollup2
WASN'T WORKING. AND AND IF THIS

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:45.061 region:rollup2
HAD BEEN A LONG TERM FIGHT THAT

01:02:42.559 --> 01:02:45.562 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO SOLUTION TO. HANDLE

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:45.929 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE MY TWO CENTS.

01:02:45.562 --> 01:02:47.230 region:rollup2

THAT YOU DO.

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:14.357 region:rollup2
AND I PAID ATTENTION TO THE

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:15.759 region:rollup2
DETAILS AT OUR UNIVERSITY.

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:16.793 region:rollup2
WE ARE DOING SOME VERY

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:18.361 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL THINGS AND I

THINK.

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:23.366 region:rollup2
I THINK I THINK OF THE SUPPORT

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:24.134 region:rollup2
STAFFS ARE UNDERVALUED.

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:25.669 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S BEEN

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:26.503 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT

01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:28.872 region:rollup2
YOU WANTED TO COME BACK TO THE

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:30.040 region:rollup2
TABLE. YOU WANTED TO NEGOTIATE.

01:03:28.872 --> 01:03:31.541 region:rollup2
AND FRANKLY YOU ARE UNABLE TO DO

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.809 region:rollup2
SO.

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:34.778 region:rollup2
I'VE ALSO NOTICED.

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:36.846 region:rollup2
THAT HE EXECUTIVES.

GET NICE RAISES.

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:39.416 region:rollup2
THE PROFESSORS GET DECENT

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:41.217 region:rollup2
RAISES.

01:16:20.543 --> 01:16:23.946 region:rollup2
CLASS THERE ARE OF SEVERAL

01:16:22.645 --> 01:16:25.147 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT DON'T PAY IF THEY

01:16:23.946 --> 01:16:25.714 region:rollup2
DON'T GET ENOUGH MONEY FROM THE

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:27.049 region:rollup2
STATE SOMETIMES THEY DO TO.

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:28.751 region:rollup2
THOSE

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:29.385 region:rollup2
DID YOU SEE FUNDS AND IT REALLY

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:31.620 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T BE THE LUCK OF THE

01:16:29.385 --> 01:16:33.289 region:rollup2
DRAW WHETHER STUDENT HAS ACCESS

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.790 region:rollup2
TO THE PROFESSOR NOT IT'S KIND

01:16:33.289 --> 01:16:36.692 region:rollup2
OF LOW HANGING STUDENT SUCCESS

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:38.627 region:rollup2
FRUIT IN MY OPINION. OF THE

01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:39.295 region:rollup2
STATE THROWS A LOT OF MONEY AT

01:16:38.627 --> 01:16:40.863 region:rollup2
THESE INITIATIVES GUIDED

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:42.198 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS TO SUCCESS AND THAT'S

01:16:40.863 --> 01:16:43.699 region:rollup2
REALLY GOOD AND THEY DO REALLY

01:16:42.198 --> 01:16:44.600 region:rollup2
GOOD THINGS.

01:16:43.699 --> 01:16:46.035 region:rollup2
BUT THE LOW HANGING FRUIT SCENE

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.436 region:rollup2
SUCCESS IS REALLY ACCESSED YOUR

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:49.939 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR SO I DON'T REALLY

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:51.507 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MORE BASIC

01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:53.242 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF STUDENT SUCCESS IS

01:16:51.507 --> 01:16:55.511 region:rollup2

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:01.951 region:rollup2
STUDENT SUCCESS AND GUIDE

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:03.352 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS MAYBE YOU GUYS WOULD.

HELP A LITTLE MORE I DON'T KNOW

01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:07.022 region:rollup2
BUT IT IT RELEASE FLABBERGASTING

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:07.957 region:rollup2
TO ME AS TO WHY STUDENTS SHOULD

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:09.558 region:rollup2
NOT BE ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:13.262 region:rollup2
PROFESSORS ACROSS THE SYSTEM

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:14.163 region:rollup2

OF THE TOTAL COSTS GOING THERE

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:56.172 region:rollup2

AND WHICH AS HE SAYS IN THIS

01:17:58.407 --> 01:18:01.577 region:rollup2
PASSAGE.

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:02.511 region:rollup2
WOOD TAKES WAY MONEY THAT WOULD

01:18:01.577 --> 01:18:06.181 region:rollup2
BE GOING TO HELP OUT STUDENTS

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:07.950 region:rollup2

WELL HOPE TO WONDERFUL THING

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:20.095 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE PLAN.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.362 region:rollup2
IN THE END I AND I SAY THAT

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:21.797 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:24.567 region:rollup2
.

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:26.468 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER AYE INSINCERITY.

01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:28.204 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:30.039 region:rollup2
ARE MANY MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:31.073 region:rollup2
PASSED BY THIS HOUSE.

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:33.542 region:rollup2
BY THE LEGISLATURE.

01:18:31.073 --> 01:18:35.544 region:rollup2
.

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:37.379 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE TAKEN MANY ATTEMPTS.

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:39.748 region:rollup2
YOU NO ONE THAT COMES MOST

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:41.483 region:rollup2
READILY QUICKLY TO MINE. IS A

01:18:39.748 --> 01:18:43.986 region:rollup2
THE DRIVER'S LICENSE.

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:46.755 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT OUR PREDECESSOR

01:18:43.986 --> 01:18:48.991 region:rollup2
HERE. YOU KNOW I THINK OVER FIVE

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:51.193 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TIMES INTRODUCED THAT

01:18:48.991 --> 01:18:53.862 region:rollup2
BILL ONLY TO HAVE IT VETOED.

01:18:51.193 --> 01:18:55.464 region:rollup2
THAT TIME AFTER TIME.

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:57.533 region:rollup2
AND SO PERSISTENCE R. IS WORTH

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:58.133 region:rollup2
SOMETHING.

01:18:57.533 --> 01:18:59.668 region:rollup2
AND.

01:18:58.133 --> 01:19:01.737 region:rollup2
WHEN SOMETHING IS NEEDED.

01:18:59.668 --> 01:19:03.939 region:rollup2
WE DON'T GIVE UP.

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:05.541 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THIS IS MUCH NEEDED.

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:07.109 region:rollup2
SO TWO THINGS TO ANSWER YOUR

01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:09.178 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:11.213 region:rollup2
I I THINK THAT THE.

01:19:09.178 --> 01:19:12.014 region:rollup2
COST CONCERNS WITH THE

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:12.881 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.

01:19:12.014 --> 01:19:15.351 region:rollup2
.

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:18.020 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:19.989 region:rollup2
HA EXAGGERATED.

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:22.224 region:rollup2
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE COST.

01:19:19.989 --> 01:19:24.159 region:rollup2
IS WHAT HE SAYS IT IS.

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:25.394 region:rollup2
SO I I THINK THAT WE CAN ADDRESS

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:27.463 region:rollup2
THE COST.

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:27.696 region:rollup2
ONE.

01:19:27.463 --> 01:19:29.265 region:rollup2
AND TO.

01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:30.966 region:rollup2
.

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:32.267 region:rollup2
I WILL BE HAVING A FURTHER

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:35.137 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:37.239 region:rollup2
OFFICE TO LOOK FOR.

01:19:35.137 --> 01:19:40.142 region:rollup2
ALSO COSTS A.

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:41.243 region:rollup2
SAVING MEASURES THAT WE CAN DO

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:42.378 region:rollup2
AND IMPLEMENTING THIS BILL.

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:44.113 region:rollup2
SO.

01:19:42.378 --> 01:19:46.382 region:rollup2
.

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:47.516 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE TWO THINGS.

01:19:46.382 --> 01:19:51.287 region:rollup2
JARVIS I HOPE TO HAVE BETTER

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:53.022 region:rollup2
LUCK.

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:53.956 region:rollup2
ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS

01:19:53.022 --> 01:19:55.924 region:rollup2

A IT'S A DIFFICULT.

01:20:02.064 --> 01:20:05.801 region:rollup2
.

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:08.037 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE ALWAYS A CONFLICT COME

SOMEONE OTHER THAT IT IT IT GETS

01:20:10.606 --> 01:20:14.410 region:rollup2

AN INSTANT IN THE INSTITUTION

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:19.882 region:rollup2
ITSELF.

01:20:18.414 --> 01:20:21.817 region:rollup2
I DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND WHY

01:20:19.882 --> 01:20:23.319 region:rollup2
OFFICE HOURS ARE IMPORTANT AND

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:24.586 region:rollup2
SOME OF MY FRIENDS WHO WORK OR

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:26.355 region:rollup2
AT THE UNIVERSITY WOULD ALWAYS

01:20:24.586 --> 01:20:28.390 region:rollup2
WONDER WHAT'LL I DO THE REST OF

01:20:26.355 --> 01:20:30.325 region:rollup2
THE DAY. AFTER I SPENT.

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:31.994 region:rollup2
SEVEN EIGHT HOURS TEACHING YOU

RESEARCH AND THINGS LIKE THAT

01:20:35.464 --> 01:20:38.767 region:rollup2
THAT IMPORTANT. BUT ALL BUT MOST

01:20:37.433 --> 01:20:40.336 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT MEETING WITH STUDENTS

01:20:38.767 --> 01:20:41.603 region:rollup2
I MEAN THAT IS CRITICAL OF IT

01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:42.204 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY THE

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:43.839 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHICH

01:20:42.204 --> 01:20:52.614 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES. MORE THAN THAT THE

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:53.482 region:rollup2
OTHER CAMPUSES BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:54.083 region:rollup2
WHAT I FOUND IS THAT MANY OF OUR

01:20:53.482 --> 01:20:55.017 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO AT THE COMMUNITY

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:55.584 region:rollup2
COLLEGE LEVEL ARE THE ONES WHO

01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:57.086 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NEED THE GREATEST

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:58.253 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF. GUIDANCE AND TOUCHING

01:20:57.086 --> 01:20:59.388 region:rollup2
AND FOLKS BASICALLY HELPING THEM

01:20:58.253 --> 01:21:00.189 region:rollup2
TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS AND

01:20:59.388 --> 01:21:01.290 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING THEM TO REMAIN THERE

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:02.524 region:rollup2
WERE OTHERS MAY HAVE COME WITH

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:03.726 region:rollup2
THE SPECIFIC MISSION IN MIND

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:05.294 region:rollup2
THAT A BE AEROSPACE UP ANOTHER

01:21:03.726 --> 01:21:06.195 region:rollup2
WHATEVER. AND AND SO THE

01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:07.563 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE THEY SEEK MAYBE NOT

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:09.531 region:rollup2
ONLY JUST TECHNICAL ABOUT WHAT

01:21:07.563 --> 01:21:10.599 region:rollup2
THE STUFF IS WRITTEN A BOOK BUT

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:12.301 region:rollup2
I OFTENTIMES AT THE AT THE AT

01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:12.835 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL

01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:16.004 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU HAVE STUDENTS

01:21:12.835 --> 01:21:17.506 region:rollup2
ENTERING. WHO SOMETIMES ARE NOT

01:21:16.004 --> 01:21:18.707 region:rollup2
REAL CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT

01:21:17.506 --> 01:21:20.976 region:rollup2

STUFF THEY'VE LEARNED FITS

01:21:21.844 --> 01:21:27.449 region:rollup2
TOGETHER IN A PATTERN OF SOME

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:30.119 region:rollup2
SORT. AND I REALLY MAY BE COMING

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:30.953 region:rollup2
OUT ENVIRONMENT WHERE HIGHER IT

01:21:30.119 --> 01:21:31.954 region:rollup2
IS NOT A.

01:21:30.953 --> 01:21:32.621 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU HAVE THE STUDENTS

01:21:31.954 --> 01:21:33.655 region:rollup2
THERE WHO REALLY NEED TO HAVE A

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:34.223 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:35.891 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:21:42.364 --> 01:21:45.634 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY TO SENEGAL STATE.

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:47.736 region:rollup2

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:48.570 region:rollup2
REASON WHY THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:50.205 region:rollup2
AFTER TWO OR THREE YEARS OF

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:52.608 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIGURE IT ALL OUT. WAS

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:53.942 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF DOCTOR SO AND SO IS

COMMUNICABLE AS. THE STATE IN

01:21:56.845 --> 01:21:59.815 region:rollup2
TOUCH WITH THEM THAT ENCOURAGED

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.783 region:rollup2
HIM TO DO SOMETHING THAT KEPT

01:21:59.815 --> 01:22:02.718 region:rollup2
THEM FOCUSED.

01:22:00.783 --> 01:22:04.686 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW WE'VE PUT A BIG PRICE

01:22:02.718 --> 01:22:07.222 region:rollup2
OR BIG IDEA ON HAVING STUDENTS

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:08.757 region:rollup2
INTO THE INSTITUTION IN GRADUATE

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:10.559 region:rollup2
IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME.

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:12.661 region:rollup2
A AND AND THAT'S A BIG PRIORITY

01:22:10.559 --> 01:22:13.762 region:rollup2
AT THIS CAPITA WE'VE SAID THAT.

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:15.063 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALSO SAID THE CENTRAL TO

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:16.899 region:rollup2
THAT IS MENTORING.

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:18.700 region:rollup2
AND COUNSELING.

01:22:16.899 --> 01:22:19.701 region:rollup2
AND OFTEN TIMES COUNSELING IS

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:21.703 region:rollup2
NOT IN THE COUNSELING CENTER.

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:23.105 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE CLASSROOM.

01:22:21.703 --> 01:22:24.606 region:rollup2
OR OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM WITH

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:26.275 region:rollup2
THAT PARTICULAR FACULTY MEMBER

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:27.776 region:rollup2
AND SO MANY STUDENTS HAVE NEVER

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:29.778 region:rollup2
SEEN IT A CAMPUS COUNSELOR. BUT

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:30.412 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE SEEN THEIR PROFESSOR.

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.847 region:rollup2
THEY'VE SEEN THE PERSON IN THE

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:33.849 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM SO I THINK WE HAVE TO

01:22:31.847 --> 01:22:35.217 region:rollup2
KEEP PUSHING THIS BECAUSE IT IS

01:22:33.849 --> 01:22:36.452 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S WHAT THE INSTITUTIONS

01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:38.153 region:rollup2
DO AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:40.122 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT IS MORE

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:41.790 region:rollup2
THAN THE HOUR A DAY IN CLASS

01:22:40.122 --> 01:22:43.525 region:rollup2
WITH THE PROFESSOR IT'S

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:45.427 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES OUTSIDE EXPERIENCE IN

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:47.029 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION THAT MOTIVATES

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:49.097 region:rollup2
AT STUDENTS TO CONTINUE TO WORK

01:22:47.029 --> 01:22:49.665 region:rollup2
TO DO THE JOB TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:50.499 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING. AND TO BECOME

01:22:49.665 --> 01:22:50.999 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL

01:22:50.499 --> 01:22:53.035 region:rollup2
AND.

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:54.102 region:rollup2
AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE

01:22:53.035 --> 01:22:56.038 region:rollup2
HAVE TO KEEP PUSHING THESE

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:57.206 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT IMPORTANT. WE HAVE

01:22:56.038 --> 01:22:58.440 region:rollup2
GONE THROUGH A PROCESS AT LEAST

01:22:57.206 --> 01:23:00.275 region:rollup2

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:02.878 region:rollup2

01:23:00.275 --> 01:23:04.947 region:rollup2

01:23:04.947 --> 01:23:07.716 region:rollup2
ALL ABOUT AND HOW THEY OPERATE

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:09.485 region:rollup2
AND HOW THEY DEAL WITH STUDENTS

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:11.220 region:rollup2
IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS UNDER

01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:12.654 region:rollup2
UNDER DIFFICULT TIME TO DO THAT?

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:14.723 region:rollup2
TIMES ARE BETTER.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:15.324 region:rollup2
