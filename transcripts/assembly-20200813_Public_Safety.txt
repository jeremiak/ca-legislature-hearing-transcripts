THREE SIX NINE HER PRISONERS CAL REENTRY COME YOU MAY BE. TO BURKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE A TEN US COOPER ON THIS MAY PERSON AS I SAID THAT SENATOR CARPER ASSEMBLY MEMBER COM LOG IS ONE OF THE BUT HERE ON THIS BILL. IN JUST IN SOME. WE HAVE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IT SAYS WHEN SOMEBODY BREAKS A RULE AND VIOLATES IS EIGHT FUNDAMENTAL HARM AGAINST SOCIETY THAT WE WILL TAKE THEM OUT OF SERVICES SOCIETY AND PUNISH THEM BY PUTTING THEM IN PRISON. THE GOP ARE OUR BASIC- MORAL CODE IS THAT WHEN SOMEONE HAS PAID THEIR PRICE. THEY'VE DONE THEIR TIME THEY PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY. THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET BACK INTO SOCIETY IN A WAY THAT GIVES THEM EVERY OPPORTUNITY AND TREATMENT AS ANY OTHER DECENT INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE THEY PAID THEIR DEBT. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE LET OUT OF PRISON. OFTEN THEY'RE PUT IN VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND COMMUNITIES AND PEOPLE SEE ALL YOUR GOOD COMMITTING CRIMES AGAIN WE LITERALLY GIVE PEOPLE OPPORTUNITIES YOU KNOW SUPPORT IF SOMEONE'S BEEN AWAY FOR A LONG TIME. ALL OF THIS KIND OF HUMAN ARCHITECTURE OF WHAT WE DO IS MISSING TWENTY EIGHT STATES HAVE RE ENTRY COMMISSIONS. WE RELEASED ALMOST FORTY FIVE THOUSAND FORTY SOME THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR BY THE HUNT ROUND NUMBERS ABOUT A HUNDRED A DAY. AND SO. THE IDEA BEHIND THIS IS TO KIND OF COORDINATE ALL OF THE ACTIVITY THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER PROGRAMS AND OTHER THINGS. BUT FOCUSING ON THE INDIVIDUAL BRINGING THE RIGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER. WE IN FACT IS THE BILL SAYS- THE THAT WE HAVE. ON. FORTY THREE THOUSAND RE ENTRY BARRIERS AND FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOCUMENTARY BE IF WE HAD TEA IN THE STATE SOMEONE'S GOING TO TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF THAT. COORDINATE BOTH RESOURCES FROM PHILANTHROPIC WORLDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND TRY TO FOCUS ON THE HUMAN CONDITION OF HOW TO REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS FOR FOLKS. AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING IT DOESN'T COST MORE MONEY WEEK YESTERDAY TO BE A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLRS A YEAR. BUT TO REALLY COORDINATE THIS IN A NUMBER OF GROUPS CAME TO ME YOU SEE THE SUPPORT LIST ALSO IS THE POLICE AT. PLEASE DEPARTMENT AND THE SHERIFF'S IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES ORDERS ROADS LETTERS SO YOU'VE GOT A SITUATION WHERE. IT'S REALLY KIND OF EVERYBODY COMING TOGETHER AND RECOGNIZING A PROBLEM AND QUITE FRANKLY WE'VE DONE SOME PILOT PROJECTS IN THIS LEGISLATURE HERE AND THERE. THIS IS REALLY A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW AND I CANNOT. I WILL. THIS IS NOT MY IDEA LET'S MOST BILLS ARE MY IDEAS THE PARTICULAR CRAZY BUT A GROUP OF FOLKS CAME TO ME AND THEY CAN'T I JUST LIKE WOW WHAT A GREAT I IT REALLY BOTH LAST BILL LIKE WHICH BEFORE AND THIS I THOUGHT WAS A GREAT IDEA AND I'M EXCITED CARRY SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE.

MAKES DECISIONS LIKE THIS HUNDRED TWENTY MEMBER LEGISLATURE BUT THAT WITH THE EFFORT IS TO REACH OUT AND TO GET AS MUCH INPUT AS POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN IMPACT.
