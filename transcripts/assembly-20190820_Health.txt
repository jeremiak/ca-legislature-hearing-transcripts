COMMITTEE A HEARING TODAY IS YOU'LL SEE WE'RE QUITE A BIT SHY OF A QUORUM SO WILL BE STARTING THIS A SUBCOMMITTEE TODAY JUST WANNA MAKE A COUPLE OF ANNOUNCEMENTS. THE A TWO BILLS BEFORE US TODAY AND WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW THE TIME LIMIT OF TEN MINISTRY SIDE FOR BOTH BILLS ADDITIONALLY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AFTER THAT TESTIMONY WILL BE ASKED JUST FOR THEIR NAME IN ORGANIZATION AND POSITION ON THE MEASURE AND NO ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY THERE. ARE THERE ARE NO BILLS PROPOSE FOR CONSENT AND SEEN THAT SENATOR RUBIO IS HERE WHICH LIKE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTY EIGHT. THANK YOU AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE FIRST TODAY ON GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY I'M PRESENTING SB FIVE THIRTY EIGHT TO AT THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS TO SUBMIT A PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AND PHOTOGRAPH OF EACH TYPE OF DEVICE THEY WILL SELL UP TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND IMPOSE A REASONABLE FEE ON MANUFACTURERS TO COVER THE DEPARTMENTS COST AT THAT MINISTERING THIS PROGRAM DESPITE LAWS PROHIBITING THE SALE OF ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT CIGARETTES TO PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD. THEIR USE HAS RAPIDLY BEEN INCREASING WE ARE SEEN DEVICES ON THE MARKET THEY LOOK LIKE USB FLASH DRIVES EVEN PENS COMMON OBJECTS THAT EASILY GO UNDETECTED. AS A FORMER EDUCATOR I CAN TELL YOU THAT TODD THESE DEVICES ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO TACT ESPECIALLY THAT THEY'RE- USING ITEMS THAT RESEMBLE CLASSROOM EVERYDAY ITEMS. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A HIGHLIGHTER FOR ANY TEACHER OUT THERE. WE HAVE A PENCIL CASE THAT TYPICALLY OUR KIDS KEEP LEAD IN. AND SOLD TODAY I FIND THIS TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT AT LEAST OUR TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS UNDERSTAND WHAT'S OUT THERE AND WHAT TO LOOK FOR. SO ACCORDING TO THE REPORT RELEASED BY THE UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION IN NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN. MORE THAN THREE POINT SIX MILLION MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED USING THESE DEVICES WITHIN THE PAST THIRTY DAYS. THIS IS AN INCREASE FROM ONE POINT FIVE MILLION STUDENTS AS THE PREVIOUS YEARS. THIS MAKES IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR PARENTS AND EDUCATORS ONCE AGAIN TO IDENTIFY THESE OBJECTS. ARE WITH ME TODAY IS MEGAN FORD A RECENT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE AND LEXI. I CAN NOW LEE WHO ARE HERE TO TESTIFY ON MY BEHALF THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. A GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LEXI OPTIONALLY I AM AN INCOMING SENIOR OUT RIO AMERICANO HIGH SCHOOL AND PROUD TO BE HERE TO SUPPORT SENATOR RUBIO SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTY EIGHT I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES AND IT TOOK E OVER A YEAR OF TRYING TO QUIT TO FULLY STOP MY EVERYDAY USE EVER SINCE I HAVE STOPPED THE USE OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES I'VE NOTICED HOW THEY'VE WE'VE THEMSELVES INTO THE SOCIAL LIVES OF ALL OF MY PEERS. AT SCHOOL I SEE ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES CONSTANTLY WITH STUDENTS USING THEM IN THE BATHROOM PASSING THEM AROUND AT LUNCH AND EVEN DURING CLASS WHEN THE TEACHERS BACK TO BACK IS TURNED AWAY FROM THEM THERE IS A FALSEHOOD ASSUMES BY TEENS THAT THESE ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES ARE HARMLESS THIS FALSEHOOD WAS TOLD TO BE TOLD TO ME BY MY PEERS WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN IN HIGH SCHOOL AND INSPIRED ME TO TRY TO USE ONE FOR THE FIRST TIME. I WAS QUICKLY ADDICTED AND WAS EASILY ABLE TO HIDE IT FROM MY TEACHERS AND PARENTS AS I COULD COMFORTABLY KEEP IT IN MY POCKET. I COULD EASILY AND DISCREETLY USE IT WILL MY PARENTS WERE HOME. AND WAS EVEN ABLE TO CHARGE IT WHILE THEY WERE IN THE SAME ROOM AS ME. IT WAS THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF WHEN I WOKE UP IN THE MORNING AND THE LAST THING I DID BEFORE GOING TO BED. I WAS AN ADDICT. I STOP USING MONTHS AGO. BUT NOW I SEE NEW DESIGNS AND DEVICES PASSED AROUND BY MY PEERS AT SCHOOL THAT I DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE. THESE COMPANIES ARE CREATING NEW DESIGNS SO RAPIDLY TO KEEP KIDS ATTRACTED TO THE IDEA OF HAVING THEIR OWN STYLISH DEVICE. AND KEEPING THEM ADDICTED TO NICOTINE AND MARIJUANA. THESE DEVICES ARE SO DISCREET CONVENIENT AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE FOR TEENS TO USE THAT WE NEED PARENTS AND EDUCATORS TO. BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THESE DEVICES. IN ORDER TO STOP. IN ORDER TO HELP STOP TEENS FROM EXPERIENCE IN A LIFELONG ADDICTION. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW PARENTS AND EDUCATORS TO HAVE A RELIABLE SOURCE TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES ON WHAT THESE DEVICES LOOK LIKE AND EXACTLY WHAT TO LOOK FOR. AS THESE DEVICES ARE EASILY MISTAKEN FOR EVERYDAY ELECTRONICS IT IS CRUCIAL WE GIVE ADULTS THE PICTURES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THESE DEVICES SO THEY HAVE THE RESOURCE TRY IDENTIFY THESE ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES AND HELP TEENAGERS WITH ADDICTION. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN MY NAME IS MEGAN FORD I'M A NEWLY GRADUATED SENIOR FROM RARE AMERICANO HIGH SCHOOL AND I'M PROUD TO BE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTY EIGHT BY SENATOR RUBIO. I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE WITH ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES AS WELL AS WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT THEM. A FEW YEARS AGO I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE MY AGE TO USE ELECTRONIC TOBACCO PRODUCTSNO WHAT I'VE EVER CONSIDERED USING ONE MYSELF. I BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE NEWER SPEAKER VAPES ABOUT A YEAR AGO WHEN A FRIEND TAUGHT ME HOW TO ONE HELL TO GET A HEAD RUSH OR A BUZZ FROM HIS BREEZES FIRE. THIS WAS A TINY METALLIC BOX THAT FIT IN THEIR HANDS AND WAS DISCREET ENOUGH TO HEAD IN CROWDED RESTAURANTS WITH THEIR PARENTS THE NEXT ROOM AND EVENTUALLY EVEN DURING CLASS. IT HONESTLY DID SEEM HARMLESS REST OF THE TIME AND IT TAKES OF THAT GREEN APPLE. WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE BACK THEN WAS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE CHEMICALS IN TORRANCE CIGARETTES MAY NOT EXISTING PAGES. MOST BRANDS WHICH IS STILL CONTAINS CARCINOGEN. CARCINOGENIC SUBSTANCES AS WELL AS INCREDIBLY CONCENTRATED ABOUT SOME NICOTINE THAT I GOT ADDICTED TO VERY QUICKLY. I DIDN'T REALIZE OF THE RUSH I THOUGHT WAS DUE TO NICOTINE INCREASING MY JOB MADE AN INTERNAL LEVELS MY PRIDE PRESSURE BLOOD PRESSURE AND MY HEART RATE. AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT I WOULD EVENTUALLY NEED AFFECTS IN ORDER FOR MY BODY AND BRAIN TO FUNCTION NORMALLY. THERE'S SO MUCH WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE AFFECTS OF THE CIGARETTES AND WITH THE CONCENTRATE ACTION OF NEW AND MORE DISCRETE DEVICES SOME DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WOULD HELP EDUCATE THE GENERAL PUBLIC MORE SPECIFICALLY TEACHERS AND PARENTS ON WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN THEIR CLASSROOMS AND HOMES. PUTTING DESCRIPTIONS AND PHOTOS OF EVERYDAY DEVICE ON THE MARKET AND SENDING THIS INFORMATION OUT TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HELP EDUCATORS AND PARENTS REALIZE WHAT EXACTLY THEIR KIDS ARE USING. AND TAKES STEPS TO HELP THE KIDS REALIZE WHAT USING WILL DO TO THEM.

WE HAVE BEFORE US ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE. ASK IF YOU ACCEPT THE MINUTES BEFORE WE MOVE A BILL IS. THAT'S AMENDED. PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LET ME BEGIN THE SEVENTY BY CLARIFYING THE AMENDMENTS THE AUTHORS. OF AB SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE ARE ACCEPTING TODAY INCLUDING MYSELF THE FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS CLARIFY THE DEFINITION OF LIKE TRONIC CIGARETTES AS INCLUDED. FLAVORED E. LIQUIDS IN PODS WHETHER WITHOUT NICOTINE REQUIRE RETAILERS TO CHECK AND VERIFY ID FOR EVERY SALE. STRIKE DUPLICATIVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND FINALLY STRIKE SECTION SEVEN OF THE BILL DEALING WITH THE SALE OF FLAVORED E. CIGARETTES. WHILE I PERSONALLY BELIEVE AB SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE ALREADY STRIKES THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN ALLOWING ADULTS TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS IN COMBATING UNDERAGE USE MANY MEMBERS BOTH OF THIS COMMITTEE. OUR BODY AND PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS FEEL OTHERWISE. IN MY OWN COMMITTEE I ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS WHICH REMOVED PENALTIES FOR YOUTH CAUGHT POSSESSION DESPITE MY PERSONAL BELIEF THAT TEENS NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THEIR DECISIONS. HOWEVER THIS ISSUE IS TOO IMPORTANT TO ALLOW IDEOLOGICAL PURITY TO STAND IN THE WAY OF PROGRESS AND WE HAD MUCH DISCUSSION IN OUR COMMITTEE ABOUT THAT. IT IS IN THAT SPIRIT THAT TODAY WE WILL ACCEPT THESE AMENDMENTS AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IN ADDITION WE WILL TAKE IN AUTHORS AMENDMENT TO CORRECT A DRAFTING AIR. WHICH EXCLUDED HOOKAH FROM THE DEFINITION OF THE CIGARETTE AS IS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LAW MIXTURE. I HAVE ALSO HAD CONVERSATIONS SOME OF THE OPPOSITION ABOUT CLARIFYING THE AB SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE DOES NOT. REPEAT MYSELF DOES NOT PREEMPT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR IMPOSING E. CIGARETTE FLAVOR BANDS OR OTHER SALES RESTRICTIONS WE AGREED THIS MORNING NOT TO INCLUDE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE ON PREEMPTION GIVEN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS BEING ADOPTED HERE. TODAY BUT I'M HAPPY TO STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT IS NOT OUR INTENT WITH THIS BILL TO PREEMPT LOCAL GOVERNMENT EFFORTS. WITH ALL THAT SAID AB SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE IS THE PRODUCT OF MONTHS OF CONVERSATION COMPRADOR COMPROMISED REMEMBERS THIS BODY. THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY PROHIBITS VAPING COMPETITION ADVERTISING USING PACKAGING THOSE ATTRACTED TO KIDS INCLUDING BANNING THE USE OF CARTOON MASCOTS IN PACKAGING RESEMBLING CANDY. THE BILL RAMPS UP PENALTIES ON RETAILERS AND STRAW PURCHASERS TO PROVIDE THESE PRODUCTS TO KIDS AND REQUIRES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CONDUCTS STING OPERATIONS AT RETAIL SITES REPRESENTING NO LESS THAN TWENTY PERCENT. OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LICENSED TOBACCO RETAILERS. THE BILL ALSO IMPOSES MORE STRINGENT AGE VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS ON TOBACCO SALES AND PROHIBITS ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE FROM ENTERING A TOBACCO SHOP. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE REPRESENTS A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH TO CLOSE YOUTH ACCESS POINTS INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY IS FOR THOSE THAT VIOLATE THE LAW RESTRICT EXPOSURE TO THESE PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUED OVERSIGHT AND EDUCATION ON THE ISSUE. THE BILL REMAINS A WORK IN PROGRESS AS EVIDENCED BY THE MEMBERS WE'RE TAKING HERE TODAY BUT THIS REMAINS A GOOD BILL. WHEN THIS BILL WAS HEARD ASSEMBLY GEO ONE OF THE WITNESSES WHO SPOKE IN FAVOR WAS A SOPHOMORE.FROM MODESTO HIGH SCHOOL IN MY DISTRICT AND AFTER HER EXPERIENCE TESTIFYING IN COMMITTEE SHE WROTE AN OP ED FOR THE MODESTO BEE DETAILING HER EXPERIENCE. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE MY COMMENTS USING HER WORDS. COMPROMISE IS ESSENTIAL TO QUICK LEGISLATIVE REFORM THAT'S INTERPRETERS IS TOO RESTRICTIVE OR NOT RESTRICTIVE ENOUGH JUST WILL PASS THIS BILL STRIKE A GOOD COMPROMISE. MEMBERS THIS IS A PERFECT BILL AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. RESPECTFULLY ASK BROUGH. IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED DIDN'T. MOVED AND SECONDED OKAY WITH BRIDGET THE A TO Z. AS A MOTIONS AND SECONDS MISTER. THERE'S A BUNCH OF A SO. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN LINE WITH THE ENTHUSIASM I'LL BE BRIEF MORNING CARVEL HALL WITH THAT CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL. SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE AND REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK THAT THE AUTHOR HAS DONE TO ESTABLISH AN EFFECTIVE TOBACCO CONTROL MEASURE TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION OF VPOR PRODUCTS AMONG YOUTH. SEEM AS LONG SUPPORTED REDUCING YOUTH ACCESS AND EXPOSURE TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS AS NICOTINE IS NOT ONLY AND HIGHLY ADDICTIVE BUT HARMFUL TO ADOLESCENT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IMPACTED IMPACTS ATTENTION LEARNING ANDMEMORY. FROM 201-722-0182 YOUTH CONSUMPTION OF ELECTRONICAL CITY ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE TO INCREASE BY 78% AMONG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AND 48% AMONG MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN THREE POINT SIX MILLION U. S. YOUTH CURRENTLY USE EASE CIGARETTES AT THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING A TOBACCO RELATED DISEASE. INCLUDING CANCER LUNG DISEASE HEART DISEASE AND STROKE. AS THE MARKET FOR A CIGARETTES AND- AND THE EVIDENCE OF THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EASE A GREAT USE HAS GROWN SO HAS PHYSICIANS DESIRE TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE REGULATION OF THEM. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE TAKES IMPORTANT AND MEASURED STEPS TOWARD REDUCING YOUR CONSUMPTION OF THESE PART OF THESE PRODUCTS BY INCREASING ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES ON SALES TO MINORS. AND BY PROHIBITING THE PACKAGING THAT IS ATTRACTIVE TO YOU. SEE ME WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN ENGAGED IN THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ON TOBACCO CONTROL AND IS COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES CONTINUE TO MOVE THE NEEDLE. ON REDUCING CONSUMPTION OF THESE HARMFUL PRODUCTS TODAY WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT AND URGE YOU TO GO AYE ON SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE. THANK YOU OTHERS AND SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CRAIG CAMPBELL ON BEHALF OF TOBACCO FREE KIDS WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR THE COMMITTEE STAFF THE CHAIRMEN ON WORK ON THESE AMENDMENTS WITH THAT WE HAVE MOVED FROM A POSITION OF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO SUPPORT AS PROPOSED TO BE.

KELLY BROOKS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS WERE IN SUPPORT. JAMIE MORGAN WITH THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR HIS AMENDMENTS AND THE COMMITTEE OR AND HAVE TO SUPPORT THE BILL NOW AS IT'S PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. THANK YOU. STORY MICHAEL CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION WANTED THANK THE CHAIR AND THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS APPRECIATE THE AMENDS AND APPRECIATE. THE AUTHOR STATEMENT OF CLARIFICATION ON THE PREEMPTION ISSUE WE'RE TAKING THE MAN'S BACK TO ARE COUNSELED TO FORMALLY APPROVE THE CHANGE IN POSITION BUT THE AMENDMENTS AS- WRITTEN UP IN THE ANALYSIS TO SATISFY OUR CONCERNS AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANY WORKING WITH US THE ONE IN OPPOSITION. YOUR MEMBERS ALL THIS WILL BE BRIEF JONATHON FELDMAN WITH THE VAPOR TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE ARE STILL OPPOSED EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS. WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT THERE'S A LOT IN THE BILL THAT WE AGREE WITH THAT'S COMMENDABLE THAT WE THINK DOES ADDRESS THE YOUTH ACCESS ISSUE BUT- SOME OF THE MARKETING STANDARDS ARE AMBIGUOUS AND VAGUE. WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR MEMBERS TO FOLLOW SOME OF THE PENALTIES ARE EXORBITANTLY HIGH EVEN COMPARED TO OTHER INDUSTRIES IN THE SAME SPACE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE STILL POSSIBLE. IF IS THERE ANY ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEE NUMBER BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. HI I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS BUT BEFORE I STARS WENT TO THE KNOWLEDGE THIS IS BEEN WORK IN PROGRESS BY MANY INDIVIDUALS LEGISLATORS ON BOTH. SIDE OF THE ISLAND BOTH HOUSES AND WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THERE'S AN- EPIDEMIC WE SEE IT IN OUR- SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE SEE THE RESEARCH. A FEW MONTHS AGO WITH OUR LITTLE GIRLS SELLING GIRL SCOUT COOKIES AT SAFEWAY JUST ON THE STREET. AND MY TEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTERS AS ZERO SUM WAS WALKING OUT THEY SAID WELL THAT E. CIGARETTES WITHOUT A CIGARETTE AND- YEAH IT SMELLS REALLY GOOD THAT'S A LOOK AT IT IT SMELLS LIKE IT'S PRETTY TASTY TOO. AND SO LITTLE KIDS WHO ARE SAYING THIS AND THE ROMANTICIZE ABOUT THE COOLNESS OF IT THE FLAVOR. AND SO IT IS A TRUE EPIDEMIC AND WE DON'T KNOW THE IMPACTS YET THIS JUST REPORTS THIS WEEK ABOUT THESE LONG. AND ISSUES AND INDIVIDUALS AND IT'S A MYSTERY A LONG ELEMENT SO. MAYBE MANY YEARS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY KNOW THE IMPACT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT IT'S A PROBLEM SO I APPLAUD THE EFFORTS GOING HERE TODAY. AND ONE THING THAT WE DIDN'T HEAR TOO MUCH ABOUT WHAT IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT. MISTER GRAY IS WHEN YOU AND I MET WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND- OUR OFFICIALS WITH DEPARTMENT ABOUT CALLING BEVERAGE CONTROL. YOU KNOW WE SOUGHT SENSUALLY TO PASS AND SO FOR PEOPLE THAT. WHO SELL ALCOHOL THEIR ESTABLISHMENTS AND- THEY SLIP UP THE CONSEQUENCES ARE SEVERE. THE INABILITY TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS THE MONETARY FINE AND THE LOSS OF YOUR LICENSE WHICH IS A LIVELIHOOD AND TOBACCO REAL TO RETAILERS WASN'T SO. AND THEN CONVERSELY WE SAW THAT. IN THE IN THE STING REPORTS RECENTLY THE MAJORITY OF THE BAD ACTORS WERE. SOME OF THESE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW NOT THE TRADITIONAL RETAILERS SOME OF THESE KIND MONTH POT TYPE CONVENIENCE STORES AND SO THAT WAS CONCERNING SO. MAYBE CAN SPEND A FEW MOMENTS TALKING ABOUT. THERE'S A NAME IT'S BACK AND FORTH AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE MAYBE CAN LIGHTEN US ON WHAT IS STILL THERE WHAT WE'RE DOING. WITH THE ENFORCEMENT PIECE WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION OUR FIRST PARTY THE- YOU KNOW AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE AS AS AN AUTHOR OF THE BILL IN THIS SPACE EARLIER IN THE YEAR WHEN I HAD SEVERAL BILLS BEFORE THE JOKE COMMITTEE WE SAT DOWN WITH ALL THE AUTHORS MASTER GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN A WORKING GROUP OVER SEVERAL MONTHS TO DIVE INTO THE ISSUE. OF THIS YOUTH EPIDEMIC AS IT RELATES TO YOU CIGARETTES AND PART OF THAT PROCESS WAS LOOKING AT ENFORCEMENT WITH A FINE TOOTH COMB AND I THINK THE TAKE AWAY FOR MANY THE MEMBERS PERHAPS INCLUDING YOURSELF WAS THAT IT WASN'T AN AREA OF STRENGTH ARE ENFORCEMENT. MECHANISMS AS RELATES TO TOBACCO IN GENERAL RIGHT CLEARLY A LOT OF. YOU KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION HAD BEEN EMPHASIZED IN THE SPACE BUT A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE MEMBERS WE MET WITH THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND A. B. C. SEPARATELY WHICH TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT CONDUCTING OPERATIONS IN A FOUR PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH WASN'T ABLE TO TELL US. HOW. OPTIONS ENGAGED THEY WERE WHERE OF STE. EDUCATIONAL REYES AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BETTER BUT NOT AS A ROBUST. SYSTEM AS WHAT WE FOUND THE A. B. C. WHERE THERE IS SOME OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FORTY FIFTY THOUSAND STING OPERATIONS CONDUCTED STATEWIDE. AND SEEM LIKE A MORE THOROUGH EFFORT. TO ENSURE THAT THESE PRODUCTS WERE BEING SOLD TO UNDERAGE USE THAT OUR STORES NOW. I WALKED AWAY CERTAINLY IS AS A CONSIDERATION FROM THOSE MEETINGS THINKING THAT. WE MAY WANT TO STREAMLINE SOME OF THAT ENFORCEMENT I'M NOT SURE IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A B. C. HAVE OFFICERS AT THE SAME LOCATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO PART PUBLIC HEALTH. TRYING TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT I ALSO THINK THAT IS A MAJOR UNDERTAKING. BEYOND WHAT WE'RE ABLE DOING THIS BILL BUT I THINK SOMETHING THAT REMAINS ON THE TABLE FOR DISCUSSION. AND PERHAPS YOU KNOW THROUGH OUR BUDGET PROCESS. EVEN THROUGH THE BILL LATER SESSION WE MAY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO ADDRESS THAT AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WE DO ADDRESS THAT THIS BILL MANDATES A 20% TOTAL OF THE RETAIL LOCATIONS TO HAVE A STING CONDUCTED AND SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE PRACTICAL REALITY OF HOW. HOW THAT GETS DONE WHAT YOU REFERRED TO MR CARS A DIFFERENT YOU NOW CALL. AND TOBACCO REMAINS THE SAME AS WE FIRST DISCOVERED YOU COULD SELL. TOBACCO TWO HUNDRED USE I BELIEVE FIVE TIMES IN FIVE YEARS WITHOUT LOSING YOUR LICENSE. CURRENT LAW FOR ALCOHOL WAS THREE TIMES IN THIRTY SIX MONTHS. WE HAVE RECTIFIED THAT BROUGHT BOTH STANDARDS DOWN TO THREE IN THIRTY SIX IN THIS BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY. AND THE PENALTIES ON YOUTH OBVIOUSLY STILL EXIST IN ALCOHOL WE CHOSE TO STRIKE THAT FROM THIS BILL WHEN THE BILL WENT TO JAIL COMMITTEE IS THAT WAS AN AREA. THAT WE DIDN'T FIND AGREEMENT AMONGST ALL THE MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE ON THE HOUSE. THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE I DO REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE AND PERHAPS IN YOU KNOW YOUR LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE BUDGET MAVIS CARTY AND OTHERS WE CAN. START TO ENGAGE THROUGH THAT PROCESS TO SEE THAT WE GIVE THE TOOLS. THE IT TOOK PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH OR SOME TYPE OF COLLABORATION WITH A. B. C. OR- A REALIGNMENT OF DUTIES SO THAT WE CAN EFFECTIVELY MAKE SURE. THAT THESE RETAIL LOCATIONS ARE IN FACT NOT SOUND TO YOU BECAUSE THAT IS. ONE OF THE FEW TOUCH POINTS AT WHICH YOU CAN GAIN ACCESS TO SEE THEIR FROM AN ADULT AN OLDER FRIEND ONLINE OR FROM A RETAILER. YEAH AND- THE FEES IS AN ISSUE I KNOW WE'RE NOT DOING THIS TODAY AND- I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT ESTABLISHMENT TO. TO PAY FOR PROPER ENFORCEMENT. IT'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY PROFITABLE INDUSTRY. ON THE SALES WEEK I ONE GOT GAS THIS MORNING AND I TOOK A PEEK. AND IT'S- A MAJOR ADVERTISING ON THE FRONT WINDOW THE PROBLEM DISPLAY WHEN YOU WALK IN SO THAT TELLS ME. THIS PRODUCT MAKES A LOT OF MONEY FOR THAT STORE. SO IF WE NEED TO INCREASE THE FEE STRUCTURE LICENSING STRUCTURE TO PAY FOR THIS. WE SHOULD BECAUSE THAT IS CLEARLY HOW YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE GETTING THE PRODUCTS AND THAT'S WHAT THAT THAT THE STING. OPERATION THAT COMPLETE CNN REPORTED ON A FEW MONTHS AGO. SHOW SO. I'M ALL IN ON THAT I KNOW THAT THERE'S OTHER MEASURES COMING FORWARD RELATING TO. ONLINE SALES WHICH IS ANOTHER PROBLEM HOW YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GETTING A HOLD OF THIS. PRODUCT AND I REALIZE THAT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM HERE THEY WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE BILL IS THE FLAVOR ISSUE. STRONG OPINIONS. ON THAT THESE FLAVORS ARE REALLY THE HOOK FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THERE'S- POSITIONS THAT YOU YOU KNOW. ARE CHICKS THEY OUT THE TALKS ABOUT THE DOLLS MAKING. DECISIONS BASED ON YOU KNOW HIM BEING AN ADULT SO. WE WILL WE WILL. EVALUATE THAT ANOTHER DAY AND- THE ELEMENT THIS BILL BEFORE PRESS. I THINK ARE VERY. HELPFUL IN DEALING WITH THIS EPIDEMIC SO. YOU KNOW THE. GROUP THAT WE WORKED OUT A FEW MONTHS AGO LAST WEEK SOMETIME IN SUPPORT TO AND YOU KNOW WE WILL TAKE. BY SOME COMMENTS AND THEN ON OF GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE PROVIDE. I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH TAKEN THE AMENDMENTS AND I'D I'D I DO BELIEVE NOW WITH BILL STRUCTURED IT IT DOES IT DOES SOME GOOD THINGS AND I'M I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT OBVIOUSLY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT SOME ASPECTS OF THE BILL THE WAY IT WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IT APPEARED. TO PREEMPTS LOCAL ORDINANCES. IT DOESN'T NOW BY STRIKING SECTION SEVEN AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT NOT HAVING PREEMPTION WE HAVE THIRTY SIX AT LEAST THIRTY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE HAD SOME SORT OF REGULATION AROUND THIS. SAN FRANCISCO HAS BANNED E. CIGARETTES COMPLETELY SAM SACRAMENTO IS NOW BANNED FLAVORS AND COMING FROM A CITY. THAT TRIED TO RAISE THE AGE WHICH TOOK ABOUT. TWO TWENTY ONE WHEN I WAS THE MAYOR IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND BEING PREEMPTED BY STATE LAW WAS ONE OF THE BIG MOTIVATING FACTORS FOR ME GETTING BEHIND. THE BILL THAT ULTIMATELY WAS PASSED DATE THERE IS THE AGE TO BUY CIGARETTES TO TWENTY ONE. SO ANY PRE GEN FROM IS GONNA BE WITH IT WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. ALSO IT WE HAVE A INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTIONS ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE BACK RETAIL BUSINESSES. THAT HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RESTRICTIONS POTENTIALLY COUNTIES CAN DO THEIR OWN STING OPERATION CITIES COULD DO. THEIR OWN STING OPERATIONS SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO IN THAT. I ACTUALLY AM WONDERING WHERE MY INVITATION TO WORK WAS I WASN'T INVITED HIM WE CLEARLY HAVE JURISDICTION HERE. I WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ON A REGULAR BASIS. I STOOD ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THAT DOES FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO I AM DISAPPOINTED TO HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN ANY OF THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND THAT.AND I WILL AGREE WITH MR MCCARTY THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM HERE IS THE FLAVORS. THERE WAS A BILL THAT WAS NOT HEARD THAT WOULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND WE COULD I STILL WELCOME A ROBOT DISCUSSED AROUND FLAVORS. WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE SINGLE. BIGGEST ISSUE ATTRACTING KIDS TO USE THIS PRODUCT. STING OPERATIONS ARE GONNA BE DIFFERENT DPH HAS THEIR OWN UNIT A. B. C. HAS OUR OWN UNIT THEY ARE SEPARATE I DON'T SEE HOW WE ULTIMATELY COMBINE THOSE BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I A WE ARE GOING TO WHAT I DO A RECOMMENDATION PASSED THE BILL TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS IN THE FUTURE AND IF YOU CONVENE ANOTHER STAKEHOLDER GROUP RUN THIS ISSUE SINCE WE OBVIOUSLY DO BOTH HAVE JURISDICTION I WOULD APPRECIATE BEING A PART OF THAT DISCUSSION. WHICH I. CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS WAS CHAIRMAN ONE POINT A CLARITY THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE CLARITY. OF SOCIALLY WHAT WOULDN'T LEAVE THE COMMITTEE OR THE PUBLIC WITH THE IMPRESSION. THAT YOU WERE SOMEHOW EXCLUDED FROM THE PROCESS THE WORKING GROUP WAS OF AUTHORS OF BILLS THAT WERE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. BOTH IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THEN OF COURSE OF OUR SENATE COUNTERPARTS. I BELIEVE YOU MAY HAVE BEEN A CO AUTHOR TO ONE BILLS AND- WHAT'S HOUSE THE JOINT AUTHORS MR JOINT AUTHORS. TO CARD IN MISTER ARE DID PARTICIPATE AS DID. SO LAWCENTER CAR PASSED WE DIDN'T GET ALL OF THE CO OF THE CO AUTHORS OR JOINT AUTHORS FOR THAT MATTER IN EVERY MEETING. BUT CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW THAT GROUP DIDN'T INTEND TO EXCLUDE YOU AND AS WE- OPEN UP A WORKING GROUP TO THE LARGER TOPIC WHICH I THINK IS. THE CIGARETTES PART PUBLIC HEALTH ENFORCEMENT. IT'S ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THING AND I THINK THE APPROPRIATE. COMMITTEE CHAIRS BE INCLUDED WOULD INDEED BE APPROPRIATE AND THAT WOULD BE MY RECOMMENDATION TO INCLUDE WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE. IN THAT CAPACITY AS WE MOVE FORWARD TOWARDS NEXT YEAR. BUT IT TO THE WAS A POOR TO CLARIFY THAT. APPRECIATE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN. OUR MEMBERS ISN'T THE NOTION THAT WE NEED TO. ELIMINATE ACCESS TO THESE PRODUCTS FOR YOU WHERE WE DO HAVE A DISAGREEMENT IS LIMITING ACCESS TO PRODUCTS FOR ADULTS. RIGHT THOSE LEGITIMATE YOUR MERIT MERITORIOUS ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT QUESTION BUT I THINK THE ISSUE IS TOO IMPORTANT TO OUR YOUTH WE DON'T KNOW FOR SOMETHING I THINK THAT'S IN THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. TODAY I'VE STATED VERY CLEARLY THIS BILL COMING INTO THIS. WAS FOR. NOW IS NOT THE FLAVORS WE'RE NOT NAY TIRE ALIGNMENT ON THAT BUT I THINK RATHER THAN STOP. THE PROCESS OF ALL THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT ARE IMPORTANT AND COULD ELIMINATE SOME OF THIS ACCESS IS PRODUCTS WILL TO MOVE FORWARD IN AGREEMENT ON THOSE AND- CONTINUE TO WORK ON THOSE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE DIFFERENCES SO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT THE BILL I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT HERE TODAY. APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON. THE BILL. I WILL RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I. BUT. THANK YOU AND I AND I APPRECIATE THAT I WILL I WILL MAKE. ONE MORE COMMENT OKAY CHAIR GETS TO DO THAT. AND THAT IS WHAT WE DO HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ON THE FLAVORS PORTION OF THAT I DID NOT FEEL THAT I WANTED TO PUT SOMETHING IN STATUTE. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE OF LESSER AFFECTED THAN WHAT'S CURRENTLY BEING DONE BY CITIES AND COUNTIES OUT THERE. AND ONE OF THOSE KEY FLAVORS TO ME IS MEANT AND WHILE WE DISAGREE THAT AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD OR A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD CALIFORNIA LAW IS THAT TWENTY ONE IS THE LEGAL AGE. UNFORTUNATELY MEANT IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR FLAVORS FROM THE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD. AND THE THX AGE GROUP. AND I IF YOU LIKE THE STATISTICS WOULD BE HAPPY PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT BUT IT IS THE MOST POPULAR WITH THAT AGE PARTICULAR AGE GROUP. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS THE FLAVORS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A HUGE ISSUE FOR MOST OF US. I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THIS PRODUCT THE INDUSTRY RECENTLY I BELIEVE HAS SUE THE FDA. TO DELAY TESTING OF THE PRODUCTS WHICH I FIND. DISAPPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST IT FEELS THAT EVERY DAY WE SEE A AN ADDITIONAL STORY ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITH RELATED TO THIS INDUSTRY. INCLUDING MOST RECENTLY WHAT STARTED OUT AS THIRTY ONE PEOPLE WITH MYSTERIOUS RESPIRATORY AILMENTS IS NOW BLOWN UP TO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED. AND I SUSPECT THAT THAT NUMBER WILL PROBABLY INCREASE AS FURTHER REPORTS COMMENTS SO WHY THE A WEEK CLEARLY HAVE A PRODUCT THAT IS EXPLODED IN POPULARITY. BUT THE HELL OUT HEALTH EFFECTS OF THAT ARE STILL VERY VERY MUCH QUESTION. I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THAT. THE INDUSTRY WOULD PUSH BACK ON THE FTA ACTUALLY DOING THE STUDIES TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THIS LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT SO. WITH THAT WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY MR MAYES A SECOND BY MISTER BIGELOW. AND I WOULD ASK THE SECRETARY TO CALL THE ROLL THE MOTIONS TO PASS YOUR PREPARATIONS. WHEN I WOULD AYE MAYES MAYES AYE AGUIAR-CURRY AGUIAR-CURRY I BIGELOW.
