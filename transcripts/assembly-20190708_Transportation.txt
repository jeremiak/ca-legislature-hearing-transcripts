AND EVERY ONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES IS LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS. AND CURRENTLY CALTRANS HAS AND FORTY IN A HANDFUL JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO LEASE PROPERTY FOR HOMELESS SHELTER PROGRAMS AT BELOW MARKET RATE. NOW THIS IS ALREADY GIVES THE CITIES. AND COUNTIES -- HELPFUL TOOL TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S SIGNIFICANT HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE ARE CAMPING AND SLEEPING IN THESE PROPERTIES ALREADY BASICALLY. AND AS WE KNOW CALTRANS SPENDS. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR CLEANING UP OUR CAMPS. I LIKE TO POINT OUT LIKE IN MY COUNTY THEY SPENT TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE YEAR. JUST CLEANING UP. YOU KNOW SO IT DOES COST THE STATE MONEY. AND THE CITIES AND COUNTIES NEED TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH CAL TRANS COMING UP WITH REAL SOLUTIONS TO CONNECT PEOPLE WITH HOUSING. AND SERVICES AND LAST YEAR WE PASSED. THE SB. FIVE ONE NINE THIS ALLOWED THE STORY IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN JOSE. THEY HAVE TAKEN AND THEY HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGES ARE WORKING ON SEVERAL PROJECTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES TO MEET. IMMEDIATE AND PRESSING NEEDS FOR SHELTER AND SERVICES. THE TIME IS NOW TO EXTEND THE SOLUTION STATEWIDE. SO THE OTHER CITIES AND COUNTIES. MAY HAVE THE OPTION. FOR THEIR COMMITTEES AT THEIR REQUEST. SO THE BILL WOULD ALLOW CALTRANS THE WRIT LEAST REAL REAL PROPERTY TO CITIES AND COUNTIES STATEWIDE. FOR THE PURPOSES STATUS AND EMERGENCY SHELTER FEEDING PROGRAMS FOR DOLLAR MONTH. ALSO CAPS ADMINISTRATIVE FEES. AND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND PROTECTS EXISTING AUTHORITY BASED ON PASS LEGISLATION. WE WANT TO CITIES ALREADY DOING THIS TO AVOID NEW ADMINISTRATIVE HURDLES.

AND WE WERE ABLE TO BRING SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO OVER SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE EVER SEVENTEEN MONTHS WE SAW 40% OF THEM RE HOUSE AND 80% RECONNECTED TO MEDICAL SERVICES. HOWEVER THE COST OF THE FACILITY WAS ASTRONOMICAL OLD OVER 40% OF OURS SERVICE BUDGET WENT JUST A PAIN THE LEASE AND MAINTENANCE OF THIS BUILDING. WE HAVE PLANS TO DO ADDITIONAL SITES AND WORKING RIGHT NOW WITH CALTRANS ON A SITE NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE UNDER THE W. X. FREEWAY. AND IF WE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SITE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CALTRANS WE'LL BE ABLE TO DIVERT FUNDS THAT WE USED TO HAVE TO USE FOR THE FACILITIES TO PROVIDE REACHED RICHER SERVICES AND RE HOUSING AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY -- SO WE ALSO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OF SB TWO ELEVEN WE ARE -- WE ARE ANXIOUS TO HAVE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH CALTRANS AND LOOK FORWARD TO STARTING OUR WORK ON STANDING UP TO NEW SHELTER AND PROGRAMS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- KEEP DONE EXACTED RECORD THIS AWFUL COUNTIES COALITION IS -- SIR BILL MENTIONED IN HIS OPENING THE STATE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM IS A FUNDING SOURCE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED ORIGINALLY IN PROP ONE BE LATER IN THE SP. ONE AUTHORIZATION TO REWARD LOCAL COUNTIES THAT HAVE GONE OUT AND TAX THEMSELVES TO ENHANCE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE COUNTIES HAVE EXPANSION PLANS THAN EVER HAVE OVERSIGHT OF NOT ONLY THE BOARDS OF THE ELECTED OF THE THE THE TRANSPORTATION SEES BUT ALSO OF THE PUBLIC -- THEY HAVE A MOTTO IS SELF OF COUNTIES IS PROMISES MADE PROMISES KEPT IS BECAUSE THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THEY SEE. IN DELIVERING THOSE PROJECTS IN THE TRUST THAT THEY HAVE IN THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEY HAVE WITH THE VOTERS. THIS PROGRAM -- THE STATE LOCAL PARTIAL PROGRAM AGAIN WAS ESTABLISHED TO REWARD THOSE OF GOING OUT TO THE VOTERS AND ESTABLISH THAT TRUST. THIS FUNDING PACKAGE THAT YOU'RE CONTEMPLATING TODAY AND THE THE OVERSIGHT THAT THAT IS BEING APPLIED TO IT IT REALLY HAS BEEN A NEGOTIATED PROCESS THE SUFFOLK COUNTIES CAME TO A POSITION THAT WITH THE CDC AND MADE THAT RECOMMENDATION SENATOR BELL AND GERMAN FRAZIER. I THINK IN RECOGNITION OF THAT COOPERATION -- AMENDED YOUR BILL SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN TO REFLECT THE CHANGES THAT HAD BEEN NEGOTIATED WITH THE C. T. C. FROM THE SELF OF COUNTIES AND WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH -- THE POSITION OF THE ORGANIZATION -- HAS BEEN DEVELOPED OVER TIME AND WORKING WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP -- AND I THINK IT'S ONE THAT IS NOT ONLY FAIR -- TO COUNTIES WITH MULTIPLE MADE IT MEASURES BUT ALSO TO THE SMALLER COUNTIES -- WITH THAT WE APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT YOU'VE PUT IN I KNOW THAT YOU PUT IN A LETTER DIRECTING THE CTC -- ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO TO THE DAY TO MAKE THESE CHANGES WE APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE WE ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR FOLLOW UP IN INTRODUCING SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WILL OF THE LEGISLATURE NOTABLY THE VOTERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS FOLLOWED. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS APPRECIATE AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS. HELLO MY NAME'S DEBBIE HAIL AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY FOR MONTEREY COUNTY -- WERE IN USE ALSO COUNTY AS OF NOVEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN AND ONE OF THE KEY SELLING POINTS FOR US WAS TO SAY THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO SECURE STATE MATCHING FUNDS OF WE GOT OUR OWN MEASURE. ON SB ONE WAS A REAL GREAT GAME CHANGER IN THAT REGARD AND WE THINK OF COURSE SENATOR BELL -- CARE FRAZIER AND THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE FOR THEIR SUPPORT THAT MEASURE. ON THE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM IS ONE PROGRAM THAT GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL GET THESE MATCHING FUNDS -- MODERATE COUNTY RECEIVES ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND UNDER THE CURRENT FORMULA PER YEAR -- BUT IN THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM WE GOT A GRANT FROM NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR IMPORTANCE OF REGIONAL BY WAY. AND IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US OVER TWENTY YEARS TO GET THAT MONEY SO -- IF IF THE PROGRAM WERE A WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN HAVING SOME KIND OF POT FOR OF COMPETITION ESPECIALLY FOR THE SMALL COUNTIES -- WE DO FEEL LIKE THAT EVERYONE USES THE RESIN THE SMALL COUNTY WHETHER IT'S TO GET TO THE BEACHES IN MONTEREY OR WHETHER TO HAVE YOUR FRESH US STORIES AND VEGETABLES TRACKED UP TO YOUR SALAD BARS -- MANY OF THE CASE WILL COUNTIES INCLUDING OURS ORIGINALLY SUPPORTED -- THE CURRENT PROGRAM OF 50% FOR NO OFFENSE AND 50% COMPETITIVE SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE ENOUGH OF A COMPETITIVE FORMULA -- BUT WE HAD A REALLY EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION AMONG ALL THE SELF HELP COUNTIES. AND WE ARRIVED AT THE COMPROMISE PROPOSAL THAT IS CURRENTLY IN SB -- TWO SEVEN SEVEN AS IT STANDS NOW THAT IT PROVIDES A MORE PREDICTABLE FUNDING SURE FOR THE BIG COUNTIES AND THE SMALL COUNTIES. BUT IT ALSO GIVES US A CHANCE TO DO REALLY MEANINGFUL PROJECT EVERY SO OFTEN OUT OF THIS COMPETITIVE SHARE -- SAYS RESULT THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY FOR MONTEREY COUNTY SUPPORTS THIS COMPROMISE MEASURE INTO -- SEVENTY SEVEN THERE IS ONE MINOR ISSUE THAT STILL OUTSTANDING -- IT THAT -- THE DEVELOPER FEE ENTITIES EVEN IF THEY'RE IN A BIG SELF HELP COUNTY CAN STILL COMPETE FOR THE COMPETITIVE FUNDING THE WAY THAT THE LANGUAGE IS CURRENTLY WORDED. AND WE HOPE THAT AS IS MEASURE MOVES ALONG THAT THERE WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECONSIDER THAT -- IF YOU'RE COUNTY GETS A LOT OF FORMULA MONEY UNDER THIS PROGRAM -- THAT IT. IS NOT QUITE THE SPIRIT OF WHAT THE COMPROMISE PROPOSAL WAS WAS THAT -- SMALL COUNTIES OR COUNTIES WITH OURS -- THE SALES TAXES -- BUT HAD DEVELOPER FEES WOULD BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. BUT WITHOUT THAT CHANGE -- AND CURRENTLY WITH THE ABILITY TO SAVE UP TO FORMALLY FUNDS OVER FIVE YEARS WHICH IS REALLY VALUABLE TO US -- WE'RE SUPPORTER OF IT SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. MEMBERS THE PUBLIC LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS TELLING THE HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND THE SAN BENITO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY INSTRUCTS SUPPORT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARC WATTS ON BEHALF OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TODAY IN SUPPORT AND I HOPE REPORT LATER THIS WEEK -- TO OTHER COUNTIES WILL BE COMING ON BOARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ROBERTS AND I'LL BE AT THE CENTER COUNTY TRANSIT DISTRICT IN THE CENTER CEMETERY COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY WE DON'T YET HAVE A POSITION BUT WE DO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK YOUR CELLPHONE COUNTIES COALITION WE HOPE TO BE BACK.

MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ENTRY ENTRY ON BEHALF OF THE FRESNO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY OUR BORDERS YOU HAVE TO MEET SINCE THE MEMBERS OF COMMON FRIENDS. OF BUT STASHED RECOMMENDING A SUPPORT AND WE THINK OF THE SOCIAL COUNTIES COALITION FOR CREATE A FORM FOR US TO GO THROUGH. MANY ITERATIONS OF FORMULA AND DIFFERENT APPROACHES ON THIS -- GOOD WORK GOOD FORM FOR THAT WE THANK BOTH CHAIRS FOR WORKING ON THIS ISSUE [inaudible] THANK YOU. DISCUSSES WAS BECAUSE SUPPORT -- ANYBODY IN THE OFFICE IN THE AUDIENCE OF LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OR SHARE CONCERNS WITH AUTHORS BILL PLEASE TAKE STEP UP THE MIKE IN A STATE YOUR NAME IN HERE REPRESENTING PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BRISCO SCORED WE HAVE TO SANTA BARBARA COUNTY ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENT STANISLAUS COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS. WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. THE THE POSITION WAS TAKEN PRIOR TO THE BILL BEING RECENTLY AMENDED AS WELL SO IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT THE AUTHOR AND YOU MISTER CHAIR -- DID ON BRING IN SB ONE TO FRUITION VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP EXHIBIT BIKE SECTOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DONE AND THE SELF HELP COUNTIES COALITION IN GENERAL -- END RESTATING WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT WAS -- YOU KNOW AS AS SOMEONE THAT REPRESENTS SEVERAL NPOS THEY HAVE SALES TAX MEASURES WE APPRECIATE THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT. A DISCOUNT IS WORK REALLY HARD TO TAX THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO STATE ASSETS AND HAVING SOME PREDICTABILITY. IS REALLY KEY IN HELPING THEM TO TO PLAN. I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT -- THE WAY THAT THIS IS PLAYED OUT IS ACTUALLY BEEN QUITE INTERESTING BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT CYCLE -- ONE FOR ALL OF THE VARIOUS -- SP ONE PROGRAM SOLUTIONS FOR CONGESTED CORRIDORS TRADE CORRIDORS. AND LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM SEVERAL OF OF THOSE PROJECTS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE FULLY FUNDED. IF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION DID NOT HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO SO AND SO -- THE CURRENT PROPOSAL TAKES APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS. ANNUALLY OUT OF THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM. IN A CONVERTED OVER TO FORMULATE SHARE -- UNDER THE GUIDELINE PROCESS ALSO FIRST FIRING COUNTIES THAT SEEK TO HAVE A SALES TAX MEASURE. THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR POT IS ELIMINATED AND I BELIEVE SO IS THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR GUARANTEE FOR SMALLER -- JURISDICTIONS AND SO -- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY CONTINUE YOU -- A DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE BUT FOR US IT'S REALLY ABOUT PROJECT DELIVERY SEVERAL OF THESE COUNTIES. THEY DON'T GENERATE VERY MUCH PER YEAR AND SO WE REALLY DO NEED THE STATE TO BE A PARTNER TO HELP US -- FULLY FUND ARE PROJECTS AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE AUTHOR ON THIS ISSUE IF YOU. FIFTY ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC LIKE TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS BILL FOR SURE CONCERNS. SEEM NINE WHICH IS THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR THIS COMMAND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER BILL. I HAD A QUESTION FOR MAYBE THE AUTHOR OR ONE OF THE WITNESSES -- I BELIEVE THE WITNESS FROM MONTEREY MENTIONED THAT IT'S POSSIBLE UNDER THE LANGUAGE OF THIS AMENDED BILL THAT LARGER COUNTIES COULD STILL COMPETE. FOR SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT WAS SET ASIDE FOR SMALLER COUNTIES -- THROUGH THE DEVELOPER FEES PORTION DO IT IF I UNDERSTOOD THAT CORRECTLY CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT -- EITHER WITNESS. THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE STANDING WITH THE BILL'S WRITTEN. THE COUNTIES THIS IS THROUGH THE CHAIR WITH YOUR PERMISSION AND THE COUNTIES THEMSELVES WOULD NOT BE COMPETING THERE'S A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS FOR DEVELOPERS TO COMPETE IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS. I THINK THAT THERE'S SOME AMBIGUITY AND QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT. DEVELOPERS IN OTHER COUNTIES WOULD BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE SAN LUIS OBISPO IS NOT A CELLPHONE COUNTY SO YOU'RE COUNTY WOULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY OF THE PROGRAMS BUT IF YOU HAD A DEVELOPER. THAT QUALIFIED UNDER THIS PROGRAM THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPETE BECAUSE YOU'RE UNDER THE POPULATION CAP -- WITHOUT QUESTION SO WHETHER NOT LARGER COUNTIES WILL HAVE TO GO BACK AND CLARIFY THAT LANGUAGE STAFF. IN ONE OF THE THINGS OLD OLD SHARE WITH YOU IS I I COME FROM A FEE AND FINANCE AUTHORITY THAT DOES USED TO DEVELOPER MITIGATION FEES. I I THINK IT'S LIKE NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND CHANGE PER HOME THE GOES TO TRANSPORTATION ISSUES -- AND SO THEY USE THAT AS A LEVERAGE POINT WITH MET CELLS TAX MEASURES ALSO AND ALSO STATE FUNDING. SO WHEN THEY WHEN THEY BUNDLE ALL OF THESE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE. A A LEVERAGE POINT. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS IS WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS. THAT -- COUNTIES THAT DO HAVE -- SECTIONS OTHER COUNTY OR WHATEVER THAT HAVE MITIGATION FEES -- THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE BECAUSE IT AGAIN. THEY ARE STEPPING UP ABOVE AND BEYOND THEIR SALES TAX MEASURE ALSO. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. UP. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT TO DO TODAY WITH RESPECT TO VOTING BOTH SLOW COG TENS OBISPO AND SB COG SANTA BARBARA MY THE TWO COUNTIES ARE REPRESENT. HAD OPPOSITION LETTERS IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM. THE EARLIER WITNESSES TESTIMONY THAT THERE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN -- PRIOR TO THE MOST RECENT AMENDED VERSION SO -- ALTHOUGH I WILL PROBABLY HAVE STAND TODAY BUT HOPEFULLY -- IN GENERAL WE CAN WORK ON TRYING TO MAKE SURE THERE IS SOME PRESERVE MONEY FOR SMALLER COUNTIES BECAUSE AS THE WITNESS MENTIONED. AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF CARS TRAVERSE HIGHWAY ONE A ONE AND FORTY SIX AND FORTY ONE TO SHIP PRODUCE SYNC IT TO BEACHES AND THIS AND THAT. AND OFTEN IT IN AND SEND OUR IS ITSELF OF COUNTY BY THE WAY. A ST LOUIS IS NOT BUT OFTEN THEY ARE. WHEN YOU MOVED TO STRICTLY FORMULAIC COLLOCATION IT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC FOR COUNTIES? I WOULD JUST OFFER THAT THE THE CELL SMALL COUNTIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAM FUNDING AND THEY'RE GUARANTEED A FUNDING AND THEN THE COMPETITIVE FUNDING AS OUTLINED IN SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN IS SPECIFICALLY. FOR COUNTIES UNDER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WHICH MAKE UP ABOUT 11% OF THE POPULATION OF SELF HELP COUNTIES AND THEY'VE BEEN ALLOCATED 15% OF THE FUNDING SO. THE THE ORGANIZATION I I WILL AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU DELIVERY -- EXTENSIVELY WITHIN YOUR CAUCUSES I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR YEARS TWO YEARS THIS ORGANIZATION DELIBERATED AND TRIED TO WORK AND COME UP WITH FORMULAS THAT. NOT ONLY TOOK CARE OF THOSE THAT HAVE LESS BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE THOSE THAT HAVE DONE MORE INCLUDING GOING TO THEIR VOTERS MULTIPLE TIMES. TO GET APPROVAL SO AGAIN THIS WAS A PAINFUL PROCESS FOR THIS ORGANIZATION BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT. THE RESULT I BELIEVE IT'S ONLY FAIR TO THE SMALL COUNTIES BUT ALSO -- RECOGNIZES THOSE THAT HAVE DONE MORE BY GOING BACK TO THEIR VOTERS TO SEEK ADDITIONAL APPROVALS TO INVEST IN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. THE SPLIT BETWEEN -- LARGE COUNTIES AND SMALL COUNTIES SMALL COUNTIES HAVE A SEPARATE OUGHT. 15%. THE REMAINDER GOES TO THE OVER. AND A SMALL COUNTIES ABOUT. 7% ABOUT 11% POPULATION THERE STILL INCLUDED IN THE GROWING EXTRA COMPROMISE OF HE WANTS IT THAT WAY [inaudible] COMPROMISES. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR MR BIGELOW. I I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS -- MISSED ABOUT. THIS IS REALLY A WE BOTH WORKED ON THIS IS COUNTY SUPERVISORS IN THE PAST. IT IS A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING THOUGH FROM TIME TO TIME WHILE MAKING UP 11% OF THE POPULATION IT REALLY. ISN'T THE REAL THRUSTING ISSUE THE THRUSTING ISSUES AMOUNT OF MILES THE SERVER AND WITH THE PREVIOUS FORMULA THE PREVIOUS FORMING A KIND OF GAVE A LITTLE ADDED VALUE TO THOSE SMALLER COMMUNITIES. TO MANAGE THEMSELVES IN A BETTER WAY -- MAYBE YOU COULD ADDRESS HOW HOW YOU HOW YOU. YOU SAW COMING TO THIS SOLUTION SO I CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE I HAVE A ONE OF THE COUNTIES THAT'S GOT IN OPPOSITION. I'M TORN BETWEEN THIS WHOLE SCENARIO I KIND OF LIKE YOUR IDEA AND I I'M TORN WITH THE THE FOLKS WHO ARE OPPOSING IT SO. HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND THE MILEAGE IS LIKE A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TWO OR MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR ACCOUNT OUT OF THE I WOULD SAY. FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FIVE POINT. TWO BILLION FROM SB. ONE OKAY SO -- IF YOU LOOK AT THAT WAY -- VARIOUS PARTS OF THE FORMULA FOR SP -- ONE BENEFIT ONE GROUP FOR THE OTHER GROUP THIS THIS FORMULA SLIGHTLY BENEFITS OF SMALLER COUNTIES BECAUSE OF THE INFILL EMPHASIS ON THE FACT THAT -- WE'RE WE'RE BASING IT ON THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS FUNDS TO BASE IT ON THE THE FACT THAT THEY PASSED THE OF SALES TAX SO WE BASE SOME OF IT ON REVENUE AND ON POPULATION. SO -- IT'S FOR THIS ONE SUB ACCOUNT IT'S BASED ON THAT KIND OF FORMULA AS A COMPROMISE OTHER OTHER FORMULAS. BENEFIT. COUNTIES THAT ARE LARGELY MILES LIKE THE GAS TAX FORMULA COURSE DOES. AND LIKE URBAN COUNTIES GET LESS. BASED ON POPULATION PER CAPITA. THEN SOME SMALL COUNTIES WITH LARGE LANE MILES SO IT'S KIND OF I WOULD LOOK AT IT LIKE THAT IS PART OF THE IT'S ONE SUBGROUP. SO WE TRY TO TREAT THEM FAIRLY AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THE COMPROMISE I THINK THEY WORKED OUT AND WE WE HAVE A SIZE THEY WORKED IT OUT THEY WORKED IT OUT THEY WERE THE ONES THAT CAME UP WITH THE SCARBOROUGH. SO THE FINAL QUESTION IS YEAH YOU DON'T SEE AN ISSUE WITH THE THE ISSUE OF COMPOUNDING THE THE REVENUES FOR THE LOCAL SO WHEN THEY HAVE YOU HAVE A MAJOR SUBDIVISION. THAT'S CREATED AND THEY DO HAVE AS AN EXAMPLE THE NINETEEN THOUSAND THAT WAS UTILIZED. YOU AT THAT NUMBER WITH THE THE LOCAL MATCH FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE A LARGER CHUNK OF THAT. I THINK HERE YOU KNOW ON THE ACCOUNT MAYBE NOT AND DRAW DOWN ON IT MORE THAN. THEN THE OTHERS COULD EVER GET. TO I THINK MOST OF THE FORMULAS BASED ON POPULATION AND PART OF PART OF ITS BASED ON THE REVENUE FROM THE SALES TAX OR DEVELOPER FEES SO. IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT'S SKEWED TOWARDS POPULATION. AMONG THE SMALL COUNTY GROUP. OKAY SO YOU KIND OF YOU KIND OF GOT A LOOK AT THE THE FORMULA THE WEIGHTS WORK IT WAS A COMPROMISE EVERYBODY AGREED. TO RATHER MOST PEOPLE AGREE. TO YEAH I WAS JUST LOOKING OTHER MEMBER. IF I MY CAR FOR THE THE ISSUE -- IT'S THE NOTION THAT -- LET'S SAY -- ONE LARGER COUNTIES SERVICES GO LESS ANGELES THAT PARTY HAS A SALES TAX BUT THEY HAVE A DEVELOPER FEES WELL THE WAY THE LANGUAGE I BELIEVE IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IS THAT THEY'D STILL BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THIS QUOTE SMALL COUNTIES COMPETITIVE POT. THAT'S THAT'S THE ISSUE IT AT HAND AS FAR AS I SEE IT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS. INTENDED OR NOT IT'S JUST THE WAY THAT. HAVE BEEN WRITTEN SO THAT THAT'S THE ONLY ISSUE THERE WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO USE THAT MONEY DOES THAT MATCH. FOR THEIR THEIR FORMULA FUNDS -- TAKE THE SMALL COUNTY PART CAN BE USED BY LOS ANGELES IT'S A IT'S GOT TOO MANY PEOPLE. THAT WAY SO I I THINK I THINK WE DIVIDE WEEKLY THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL. PUTS A SUB ACCOUNT. FOR SMALL COUNTIES. SO IT'S A SEGREGATED SUB ACCOUNT. IT IS. THE OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE OFFICE. OF THE COMMITTEE. SING NONE US UNDER THE LIKE. TO CLOSE -- JUST THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION ON THIS ISSUE IS SO. LOT OF OUR WORK WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THANK YOU EVERYBODY FOR WORKING HARD ON THIS URGE FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS. THANK SENATOR -- ALL I CAN SAY I I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THANK GOD FOR SELF HELP COUNTIES. WITH OVER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR GOING INTO THE SYSTEM. THIS IS A THE THE LOCALITIES. TAXING THEMSELVES SO THEY CAN BE PART OF THE SUCCESS IN THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY ARE SHOULD BE TREATED AS A PARTNER. NOT AN ADVERSARY. NOT ENOUGH ZERO POSITION BUT ALSO JUST AS HEY HOW ABOUT A THANK YOU -- ONE OF THINGS I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF THE CTC WAS BASICALLY THAT MONEY WOULD BE STAGNATED. WELL SENATOR BILL AND I SAID ON THE C. T. SEEM WE WILL BE SURE HER THAN WE WANT THAT MONEY UTILIZED AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND NOBODY WILL BE SITTING ON MONIES THAT ARE ALLOCATED OUT OF THIS IT'S GOT TO BE SHOVEL READY READY TO GO -- BUT I'M PROUD TO WORK WITH YOU GET ON THIS -- AND ANYTHING THAT CONNECTED WITH SB ONE CENTER WE DID. TOGETHER AND I APPRECIATE THAT -- YOU KNOW THE L. P. P. PROGRAM WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO WORK LIKE. THIS IS WHAT YOU AND I HAD DETERMINE IN OUR BILL. JUST LIKE PROP ONE BE. AND THIS IS A I WOULD SAY PROBABLY THE CLOSEST THING THAT WE K&lt;c.cyan&gt; TO I'M GLAD THAT THE&lt;/c&gt; CELL COALITION WAS ABLE TO COME.

ISSUED VARIOUS POLICIES INDICATING THAT IT ONCE A TO MAKE THE STREETS SAFER SO CALLED COMPLETE STREETS -- WE HAVE NOT SEEN IT NEARLY ENOUGH PROGRESS AND SB ONE TWO SEVEN WILL ENSURE GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY SO THAT CALTRANS BEGINS TO MAKE THAT PROGRESS. ARE THE BILL DOES A FEW THINGS THAT ESTABLISHES AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION ASSET BRANCH I CALTRANS TO MEANINGFULLY TRACK THE DEPARTMENT'S PROGRESS. TOWARDS HIS BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN GOALS IN TERMS INCLUDING INTERIM GOALS OBJECTIVES AND ACTIONS -- THE BILL REQUIRES THAT THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN PRESCRIBER PROCESS FOR COMMUNITY INPUT.

AND CERTAINLY WE'RE ALL EARS AND YOU HAVE MY VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- MY QUESTION IS SO I GUESS THE BIGGER PICTURE OF FUNDING THE SHOP PROGRAM -- AND OR SP. ONE FUNDS WHICH FLOW NOW. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT MONEY MAY END UP? BEING SPENT. IN SOME NEW WAYS -- TO THE TO DO COMPLETE STREETS. SURE AND JUST TO BE CLEAR FUNDED BY THE SHOP -- ONE CALTRANS IS GOING OUT TO A ROAD RESURFACING OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. THAT MONEY ALREADY CAN GO TO THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT WHETHER IT'S ON HAVING A A BRIGHTER CROSS WALKER BIKE LANES ARE. BETTER TRANSIT STOP THAT SAFER -- SO ALREADY. CALTRANS FOR YOU OR CAN USE AND DOES USE -- MONEY FOR THOSE ASPECTS OF A OF A ROAD RESURFACING PROJECT AND IN FACT IT'S MORE EFFICIENT. TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA DO THAT WORK WITH MUCH CHEAPER TO DO WHILE YOU'RE ALREADY DOING A PROJECT -- AND THE AND CALTRANS OWN POLICIES ALLOWS IT TO DO THAT AND SAYS THE COMPLETE STREETS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN -- THIS BILL SIMPLY PUT BETTER STRUCTURE AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- AROUND THAT SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU AN EXACT PERCENTAGE I THINK IT'LL BE A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE IN THE BIG SCHEME. OF THINGS -- BUT I YOU KNOW THIS IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT THESE PROJECTS ACTUALLY HAPPEN -- AND THAT WE HAVE SAFER STREETS FOR EVERYONE. SO MR DAILY WE DO HAVE A REPRESENTED FROM CALTRANS HERE THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO AS I ANSWER THAT QUESTION. IF OF THE AGENCY WOULD COME UP AND BE ABLE -- TO CLARIFY MISTER DALY'S QUESTION WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR. A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M DAN HERE'S THE SYSTEM DIRECTOR FOR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS A CALTRANS. AND I HAVE WITH ME JANET SPEND. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNA SPENT NINE THE VISION SHE FOR A QUARTERS DIVISION OF DESIGN IT CALTRANS AND JUST TO CLARIFY WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL AT THIS TIME WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER THE TECHNICAL QUESTION. BEFORE US TODAY. SO SO WITH. SO AT THIS TIME WE DON'T KNOW THE ESTIMATE OF THE BILL ON THIS WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON AN INVENTORY OF BY COMPETITOR SONY'S INTO THOSE -- THAT REPRESENT THIS ON FACILITY TYPE. THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLACE TYPES AND SO WE DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF COST ON AT THIS TIME. AND IT WILL REALLY VERY PROJECT BY PROJECT -- AND SO THOSE DETERMINATIONS ARE MADE -- YOU KNOW OVER TIME AS EACH PROJECT. IS DESIGNED SO IF IT WERE MISTER DALY IS TRYING TO TO ASK IS. INTENDED PURPOSE WAS. AND AND WINDS OF UP HELD BY THE VOTERS IN PROPOSITION SIX HIS. HOW MUCH WOULD BE WE HAD AN EXPECTATION HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AT THAT POINT IN TIME? THAT'S THE ONE WITH THE FIFTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND CALIFORNIA. THAT THE SHOP WOULD BE UTILIZED FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE OF THE OF THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. SO WHAT HE'S SAYING IS HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL MONEY WOULD BE. A UTILIZED. IN THIS ROUND NOW WE KNOW THAT YOU DO IT. TO SOME EXTENT. BUT WAS SB ONE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT MISTER DAVIS ASKING. WE NEED TO KNOW AND PLEASE IF YOU CAN GIVE US SOME KIND OF SOFT NUMBER. AT SOME POINT IN TIME. WHAT THIS WOULD TAKE AWAY FROM THE MAINTENANCE? OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE HIGHWAYS TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND EIGHTY P.. SO ARE WE AUGMENTING A. T. P. WITH THE SHOP AS WELL AS THE QUESTION. OKAY SO UNDERSTANDING. THAT'S THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT I WAS REALLY MIKE. YES WHEN I APPRECIATE THAT I MEAN IN IN IN IN OTHER WORDS IF IF 2% OF OF OF SHOP FUNDS TODAY ARE -- END UP BEING SPENT ON COMPLETE STREETS. A PEDESTRIAN PROVE MEN'S -- AND SO FORTH WHICH I WANNA SAY CLEARLY I AM STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THOSE TYPES OF IMPROVEMENTS. ON THE OTHER HAND WE NEED TO KNOW -- HOW THIS WILL AFFECT OUR FUNDING PROGRAM? IF IT'S 2% TODAY AND WITH THESE NEW WITH OF FORMALIZING IT ADVERTISING IT MORE CLEARLY. BROADCASTING IT WILL IT GO MAYBE OF THE FLOW AND IT'S A LITTLE CONCERNING OF CALTRANS DOESN'T. KNOW THAT. YET -- WE'RE NOTMEAN IT IS IT'S HARD TO MAKE POLICY ON THAT BASIS BUT IT. AS AS THE CHAIR SAID AS OR EVEN A SOFT NUMBER AVAILABLE TODAY HOW HOW WILL HOW WILL HOW WILL FUNDS FUNDS SPENT CHANGE UNDER THIS BILL [inaudible] STATE WHAT. SO -- COMPLETE TO SALOMON'S ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROJECTS IN THE SHOP -- AND SO IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO TRY TO PARSE OUT HOW MUCH IS SPENT ON EACH DIFFERENT PIECE OF THAT PROJECT BECAUSE THERE'S VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPORT DESIGN COSTS -- THAT SERVE MULTIPLE PURPOSES OF THE PROJECTS BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO TRY TO QUANTIFY THE ACTUAL COST ELEMENT OF ANY PIECE OF A PROJECT AS A RESULT OF THAT. ALSO AT THIS TIME -- YOU KNOW WE COULD TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOMETHING TO YOU LATER AT A LATER DATE -- TO AT A COST ESTIMATE BUT AT THIS POINT IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THAT SUFFICE YESTERDAY IT WILL LIKELY GO UP. WHATEVER THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS IS IT WILL LIKELY INCREASE. IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW. BECAUSE IT'LL BE FOUR IT'LL BE FORMALIZED AND IT'LL BE BROADCAST. TO IN AN AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S A BAD THING IT'S JUST WILL BE IT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT. I I THINK -- AND I REALLY RESPECT THE QUESTION I I AND I I MEAN IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND. THAT WE'RE NOT INTRODUCING A NEW CONCEPT CURRENTLY SHOP PROGRAMS FOR FOR MAINTENANCE -- DO INCLUDE COMPLETE THREE ELEMENTS AND CAL TRANS HAS POLICY CENTER THIS SHOULD HAPPEN -- THE CHALLENGES THAT IT'S NOT STRUCTURE AND SO SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T -- THIS BILL ALSO PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY YOU HAVE TO BRING A LOCAL COMMUNITY AND TO CONSULT AND THERE ARE THERE IS FLEXIBILITY -- THAT'S BUILT AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PUT A STRAIGHT JACKET ON THE AGENCY% BUT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THESE POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR A WHILE -- ACTUALLY MEANS SOMETHING AND HAVING A STOCKS IN THE BOOKS -- WILL WILL DO THAT. GOOD IS IT FAIR TO SAY I MEAN I USE THE WORD -- YOUR FORMALIZING IT. YOUR STRUCTURING IT OR YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT IT BE STRUCTURED AND BROADCAST YES MORE CLEARLY. THANK YOU. THIS FROM THE JOB YOUR MAYBE -- MAYBE CALTRANS CAN AS APSO HOUSE SHOT FUNDS ALLOCATED NOW. SO THE THE SHOP FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED BASED ON OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN SO WE HAVE AN INVENTORY OF ALL OUR ASSETS FOR THE THE PRIMARY ASSETS. AND WE ALLOCATE THE FUNDS BASED ON THE THE NEED A CONDITION OF THOSE ASSETS. AND IS IS. AND MY UNDERSTANDING AND MAYBE THE OTHER CAN CORRECT THIS IS A DOES DOES THIS BILL CHANGED THE WAY -- SHOP PROJECTS ARE PRIORITIZED ANYWAY. TWENTY EIGHT IS IT DOES A PRIORITIZE -- BIKING -- WALKING PROJECTS OVER SAY MY CONCERN IS THAT YOU KNOW WE WHEN YOU SHOP FOR LET'S SAY -- EXPANDING -- CAPACITY ON HOW IN ANY. NINE A WITH THIS COMPETE WITH THAT OR ARE THE SEPARATE PROJECTS OR THESE ARE THE ODDS ARE PART OF THE SERVICE THERE'S A PRICE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF AND A USES THEM BECAUSE THE CHAIR AND I SPOKE ABOUT IT -- HIGHWAY ONE BECAUSE YOU'RE HALF MOON BAY NINE CEMETERY COUNTY IF IT IT'S IF IF THAT ROVER BEING WORKED ON THEY WOULD HAVE TO ALSO. DO FRANKLY WITH OUR CURRENT POLICY SAYS THEY SHOULD DO IS EVALUATE -- AND DECIDE WHETHER -- TO IT MAKES SENSE TO PUT COMPLETE ST ELEMENTS ARE THERE AND ACTUALLY BALL THROUGH. ON THAT SO IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S TRIGGERING NECESSARILY NEW PROJECTS THE PROJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY HAPPENING IN MAKING SURE WE'RE DOING IT -- IN A COMPLETE -- IN A COMPLETE WELL SO I DON'T DO IT AS COMPETITION -- IT DOES -- PROVIDE THAT -- THESE -- FACILITIES BY CONTRAST RAN ARE CONSIDERED SUPPLEMENTARY ASSETS CALTRANS ALREADY HAS CLASSIFICATIONS OF ITS ASSETS AND SO THE FINAL SUPPLEMENTARY AWESOME. THANK YOU SO I UNDERSTAND THAT'S THE SECOND PART OF THE THE BILL THE THE I GUESS THE FOR THE FIRST FOUR AND I GUESS MAYBE THAT THE AUTHOR TOUCHES AGAINST IT DOES THIS BILL CHANGE THE ASSET. MANAGEMENT PLAN AND HOW IT'S HOW THE PRIOR. TO SURE I CAN ADD TO THAT AND HAVE YOU GUYS BECAUSE WELL AT WHAT IT DOES IS IT IN ORDER TO OPERATIONALIZE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE. IT IS ADDING TO THE TRANSITION ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN COMPLETE STREETS AS SUPPLEMENTARY ASSET CLASSES WITH THAT WILL DO IS ACTUALLY HELP WITH SETTING COST PROJECTIONS AND ALSO PERFORMANCE PROJECTIONS AND TARGETS. SO THAT CAN GET TO AS TO YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO AND THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE REPORTING WHICH ALREADY HAPPENS WITH THE THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW HOW THIS IS -- CHANGING OVER TIME. THE DISCUSSIONS AGREE WITH THAT THAT IT DOES THEN IT DOES CHANGE THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PLAN. IT DOES IT DOES IT JUST THE ARE SUBMITTED PLAN BECAUSE IT AS THE BIKE IMPAIRED IN TRANSIT FACILITIES OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR THIS BILL. SENIOR CENTER FOR CLOSE. HI THANK YOU VERY MUCH I YOU KNOW I THINK WE CLEARLY LIVE AND YOUR OF LIMITED RESOURCES MORE OF THAT JUST LIKE WE ALL ARE AND WE WANT. TO MAKE SURE OF THAT OUR HIGHWAYS AND ROADS ARE IN GOOD CONDITION -- WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE -- THAT OUR STREETS ARE SAFE NONE OF THIS IS MUTUALLY -- INCONSISTENT -- THIS IS ABOUT TRYING TO RISE EVERYTHING UP UNDERSTANDING -- THAT WE NEED MORE RESOURCES -- FOR EVERYTHING -- AND SO I THINK WE STRUCK A GOOD BALANCE IN THIS BILL I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK MOSES FOR TAKING SOME HIS US SUMMER BREAK. TO SPEND IT WITH US TODAY AND ADVOCATE LEARNING DEMOCRACY EARLY ON AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR. YOU JOIN THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO FIGHT FOR THE CRITICAL FUNDING FOR SP ONE AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT -- WHEN WE PASS SB WHEN THE STATE WAS FACING A WHEN I SAID FIFTY NINE BILLION I WAS WRONG SEVENTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR BACKLOG OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM? ONLY MISTER BY TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. UNFORTUNATELY SB ONE REVIEWS DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW FIVE POINT. TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND NOT ALL OF THAT'S GOING TO SHOP -- TO FIX THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OF THAT MONEY. IT I REALLY DO COUPLE MIKE WHO IS YOU MENTIONED -- HAVE HAPPENED A WE TALKED ABOUT IT HILL AS I'VE BEEN UP THERE HAVE BEEN AND HIKED ON I WILL. AND SEE THE BENEFITS SIX THIS GIGGLING. YOU KNOW CALTRANS CONTINUES TO BILL COMPLETE STREETS INTO HIS PROGRAM AND WHEN AND WHERE FEASIBLE. AND YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THE PRACTICALITY OF THIS. BEING IMPLEMENTED WHERE. YOU KNOW IT WE HAVE SOME PARAMETERS -- SO THAT SOME DATA DRIVEN NECESSITY RATHER THAN. GLOBALLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- IN RURAL COUNTIES WHERE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS AND THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SEE IN THIS BILL. YOUR I'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT A MEMBER. I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT AMENDMENT -- BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS A PURPOSE AND A PLACE. BUT ALL OF THIS COULD BE IMPLEMENTED -- THAT WOULD BE. I THINK FAVORABLE BECAUSE OF WHAT IT ACCOMPLISHES. IN PROTECTION OF LIFE. HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ALSO WHAT MOSES TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HIMSELF. AND SO -- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT BILL TODAY. I AM CONCERNED THAT THE BILL ON MAY IMPACT THE STATE'S ASSET MANAGEMENT -- APPROACH. HEY COULD HAMPER CALTRANS ABILITY TO MANAGE STATE ASSETS BASED ON A CONDITIONS IN NEED AND I THINK WE NEED TO REFINE. AS YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION. I WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS -- YOU KNOW YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND I KNOW YOU'RE PASSIONATE AND YOU'RE LIKE A DOG WITH A BONE WITH THIS. AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT I REALLY DO -- SO I THINK TO PROTECT THE HEART GAINES OF SB ONE AND TO MAKE THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM SAY FOR ALL USERS WE NEED TO BE ABLE. TO JOIN AYE. WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN ABSOLUTELY -- WITH THAT. I'LL BE SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. BUT I ASSURE YOU. THAT IF WE CAN'T WORK TOGETHER AND GET THE SS CITY OF THAT I'M LOOKING.

SB SIX TWENTY FIVE CENTER WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY. COMMITTING TO ADDRESSING THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERNS VERY VALID CONCERNS HIGHLIGHTED ON PAGE FIVE AND SIX OF THE ANALYSIS. OVER THE SUMMER RECESS WILL WORK ON THOSE I AM A LOOPHOLE IN CURRENT LAW. MAKES IT LEGAL FOR PASSENGERS TO SMOKE CANNABIS IN A PARTY BUS Là M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; TAXI OR TNC.&lt;/c&gt;</u> AS A RESULT SOME PARTY BUS IN THE MALL OPERATORS ARE OFFERING CANNABIS DISPENSARY TOWARDS SIMILAR TO EXISTING TOWARDS FOR WINERIES OR BROUGH REACH. MODELED AFTER STATUTES FOR BEER AND WINE BUSES IN LIMOS SB SIX TWENTY FIVE WILL PROHIBIT CANNABIS USE IN THESE VEHICLES UNLESS THE SAFETY STANISLAVSKY STANDARDS ARE FOLLOWED. SB SIX TWENTY FIVE MAKES IT ILLEGAL FOR A PASSENGER IN A PARTY BUS OR Là M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; TO SMOKE&lt;/c&gt;</u> OR VAPOR CANNABIS UNLESS THE DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT IS SEALED. IT SEALED OFF IN SEPARATELY VENTILATED. THE BILL ALSO PROHIBITS ANYONE UNDER TWENTY ONE FROM BEING ON BOARD IF CANNABIS SMOKERS PRESENT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT THE DRIVER IS NOT IMPAIRED. IF CANNABIS SPOKE IS CONSUMED IN ONE OF THESE FOR HIGHER VEHICLES I WANT TO REINFORCE THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW. CANNABIS USE IS ALLOWED IN BUSES LIMOS AND TAXIS WITHOUT ANY REGULATION OR CONSUMER SAFEGUARDS. SB SIX TWENTY FIVE AS NECESSARY TO CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE INAPPROPRIATELY REGULATE THESE BUSINESSES. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE OPPOSITION IN THE BILL HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDED TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS SPECIFICALLY THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL. IS LIMITED TO JUST BUSES IN LIMOS REQUIRES THAT THESE OPERATORS MEET ALL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR CHARTER PARTY CARRIERS INCLUDING PERMITTING BY THE PC. AND INSPECTIONS BY THE CHP REQUIRES A THIRD PARTY LICENSED ENGINEER TO VERIFY THAT THE VEHICLES PARTITION EFFECTIVELY LIMITS THE PASSAGE OF SMOKE TO THE DRIVER. ADDS ENFORCEMENT LANGUAGE WHICH OBJECTS OPERATORS TO PENALTIES AND PERMIT REVOCATION FOR VIOLATING THE LAW. AND AGAIN I WANT TO MENTION THAT I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH THAT YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS ON ADDRESSING ANY OUTSTANDING ISSUES AND CONCERNS I FEEL. SIX TWENTY FIVE STRIKES A BALANCE THAT ALLOWS FOR CANNABIS USE ON BUSES IN LIMOS WALL PROTECTING THE DRIVER PASSENGERS AND CONSUMERS. I THINK THERE ARE WITNESSES HERE TO SPEAK ON THE BILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TEACHER NAME IN WHO REPRESENTING. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OUR ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS OVER SIX HUNDRED BRANDS AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. WE ARE VERY PLEASED AT TO SUPPORT SB SIX TWENTY FIVE WHICH PROHIBITS THE INGESTION OF CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS IN CHARTER BUSES IN LIMOUSINES AND LESS THE DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT IS PETITION DOES THE AUTHOR STATED. CANNABIS TOURISM IS ON THE RISE AND REPRESENTS A KEY OPPORTUNITY FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA. AND COLORADO CANNABIS TOURISM HAS GROWN 51% SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SIX POINT FIVE MILLION TOURISTS LOGGED IN NEARLY EIGHTEEN MILLION CANNABIS YOU STAYS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ALONE. CALIFORNIA IS FOLLOWING CLOSE BEHIND WITH CANNABIS TOURISTS POPPING UP THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN OTHER STATES -- THE THE ISSUES OR THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL ARE SIMPLY BEST PRACTICES WITH THIS AUTHOR IS LOOKING TO DO IS CODIFY THESE BEST PRACTICES INTO LAW AND MAKE THESE REQUIREMENTS. SIMPLY PUT SB SIX TWENTY FIVE IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD BILL THAT ESTABLISHES APPROPRIATE INDUSTRY STANDARDS FOR CANNABIS TOURISM WHILE IMPROVING THE SAFETY OF BOTH PASSENGERS AND DRIVERS FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL AND REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOSH POND AND WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA BUSES CESSATION WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND WE'RE JUST HOPING THAT AT SOME POINT. THEY'LL BE A PROVISION TO PENALIZE -- THE ACTUAL PERSON WHO WANTS TO SMOKE IN VIOLATION BECAUSE THERE'S NO VIOLATION TIMELY AND IT NOW. SO I THINK WITH THE AUTHOR WE'D BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT PIECE THAT IF SOMEONE. IS VIOLATING THE LAW -- THEN THERE'S A PENALTY ON THAT PERSON NO DIFFERENT THAN FOR ALCOHOL NOW I IT WOULD BE ON THAT PERSON'S SO WHERE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT PIECE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. JOHN LEVEL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NARCOTIC OFFICERS ASSOCIATION -- FIRST OF ALL CLARIFICATION THE ANALYSIS LISTS US AS BEING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. WE ARE NOT WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL SUPPORT POSITION WE WERE OPPOSED TO THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BILL. WE WORKED WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND WITHDREW OUR OPPOSITION. THAT SAID WE EMBRACE THE COMMITTEE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WILL MAKE FOR THE BILL EVEN BETTER -- IN A SURE THAT WE WON'T HAVE PROBLEMS WITH. SECONDHAND SMOKE WITH MARIJUANA IMPAIRING A IN IN IMPAIRING THE DRIVER -- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND WITH THE COMMITTEE ONE FINAL THING I'D BE REMISS. IF I DIDN'T COMMENT ON JUST THE FOR PROFESSIONALISM OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THIS IS WHAT. JESSA UNRUH HAD IN MIND WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE INCREASED PROFESSIONALISM OF A FULL TIME LEGISLATURE'S USED. EXCELLENT PIECE OF WORK. WE CAN JUST DROP THE MIKE ON THAT. ONE YEAH SO ANYWAY ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. OF THE OTHERS BILL. ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FEEL LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NINE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. OF THE AUTHOR. WHO IS AGUIAR-CURRY? SO -- FOR DINNER WITH THE MULLIN DEALS AND MY NIECE AND NEPHEW WE HAVE DISCUSSED ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE WE TRY TO BRING SOMETHING TO THE TABLE PERIODIC THEY TALK ABOUT BILLS IN THE PROCESS. AND SO I'M GOING TO SHARE A COUPLE OF THEIR CONCERNS -- AND GRANTED THEY HAVE READ THE BILL BUT I'M GONNA TELL YOU THE ONES THAT. THE CONCERNED ABOUT. SECONDHAND SMOKE. IN A CONFINED AREA -- INDIVIDUAL CONTROL OF CONSUMPTION. THAT HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT IF IF YOU'VE HAD TOO MUCH SMOKE IN A THE CAR OR WHATEVER. OTHER INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT APPRECIATE THAT SMOKE. FOR GETTING INTO A BAR I MEANT RENTING ONE OF THESE -- VEHICLES AND THE RESIDUAL SMOKE IS STILL IN IT AS WE KNOWS AND THERE'S NO SMOKING ROOMS BUT YOU STILL KNOW IT'S BEEN SMOKED IN RIGHT. SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THEY COME UP WITH JUST IF YOU. DON'T THINK YOU -- AND THE ISSUE. RELATED TO THIS BILL IS. YOU WOULDN'T BE ON THIS BUS UNLESS YOU WERE INTENDING TO PARTAKE OF OF CANNABIS OR GOING TO ARE GOING TO A CANNABIS FACILITY WHERE YOU WOULD PARTAKE THERE THEN GET ON THE BUS. THE IDEA IS THAT -- THIS IS LIKE A UP OF A LIQUOR TOUR WINE TOUR APPEAR TO OR WHERE THEY WOULD BE DOING THAT THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS TO IN THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE ELSE. IS AFFECTED BY THAT THROUGH EXTERIOR GOING OUT A WINDOW THAT THE SMOKING AFFECTION ONE OUTSIDE OR GET INTO THAT THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE SO THE THE IDEA IS THAT THOSE THAT ARE SMOKING AND PARTICIPATING IN THIS AND PARTAKING OF THAT. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THEY WOULD FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THAT THE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED -- WHEN THEY GET OUT OF THERE IN SOME WAY THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING INTO A VEHICLE SOMEHOW WE'RE GOING TO TRY? TO LOOK AT THAT SOMEHOW TO BUT THE PARTY BUS BUS BILLS THAT I'VE HAD PREVIOUSLY TO THIS HAVE LOOKED AT MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING ONTO A VEHICLE BUT THIS IS. MAINLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE -- DESIGNATED. TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT BEHAVIOR AND ACTIVITY -- IN THE ANOTHER ONE WAS -- THE WINDOWS ROLLED UP. AND GET TAUGHT ME ROLL DOWN THE WINDOWS AND THE SMOKE'S COMING OUT OF IT IS IF THAT'S NOT ALLOWED IN THIS BILL THEY THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED THROUGH THAT SMOKE TO LEAVE THAT VEHICLE THAT'S WHY IN THE DRIVER'S AREA. THE SMALL CAN'T. IN FUEL IMPACT THE DRIVER THE DRIVER IS AT ALL. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AN ENGINEER GOING INTO DESIGN MAKING SURE THAT THAT IS CLOSED IN AIR TIGHT TO THAT THERE'S NOT -- THE SEAL CAN'T BE BROKEN AND THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE SMOKE. EXITING THE THE VEHICLE AS WELL COULD THAT BE A SAFETY ISSUE. WITH THE WINDOWS ARE CAN BE ROLLED DOWN. BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT ANY BASIS FOR THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO BREAK THE WINDOW YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S ALSO PART OF PARTY BUSES AND LIMO ZINES NOW THE VENT WINDOWS DON'T GO UP AND DOWN. THERE HAS TO BE A AN ABILITY TO TO BREAK THAT WINDOW IN ORDER TO ACCESS IT THE TICKET. EXIT THE VEHICLE SO I'M GETTING WITH THIS IS THAT -- I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT THERE'S A QUESTIONS OF PEOPLE ASK. ME GENERAL QUESTIONS EITHER ASKING -- IT'S ONE THING TO MAYBE TAKE A CANNABIS BROUGH -- MY AN EDIBLE AND YOU GET THAT CHOICE. BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN A BUS NOT EVERYBODY HAS THE CHOICE. AND IF I MAY MISTER MYSTERY HOW IS THIS IS MY CLOTHES THE THE CURRENT LAW TODAY ALLOW SOMEONE TO DO THAT IN A VEHICLE -- WITHOUT ANY. RESTRICTIONS RESERVATIONS OR ACCESS ISSUES TO THE DRIVER OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S CURRENT LAW WE'RE TRYING TO TIGHTEN THAT'D MAKE IT BETTER. THANK YOU DR OF NUMBERS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. SO I WILL TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU SO MUCH I DO HAVE A FIRST PLACE A MEMBER GIPSON SECOND BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BERMAN -- THANK YOU SENATOR HELP THANK YOU MISTER KING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THIS -- OBVIOUS FOR YOUR BILL TODAY WITH YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK MYSELF ON THE AMOUNT IS SO WITH THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THERE IS NO ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT THE DRIVERS IT IS SEALED OFF. A FROM THE PASSAGE PRICE JUST FEEL IT'S IRONIC THAT WE CONTINUE TO PUSH THIS. SOCIETAL ISSUE AND WE DON'T EVEN HAVE ANY KIND OF LAW FIRM PAYMENT. WHILE DRIVING. HELLO STILL CLASS CLASS WONDER OF FIVE FAT. SO I MEAN WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS BUT I THINK ONE OF THE URGENCY IS OUR IMPAIRMENT AND I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME KIND OF TECHNOLOGICAL. ADVANCEMENTS SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THIS. HORRIFIC OPPORTUNITY TO KILL SOMEBODY -- AND I AGREE BUT I ALSO BELIEVE WE SHOULD HOLD CHARTER PARTY CARRIERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALLOWING MINORS. TO CONSUME CANNABIS JUST AS WE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALLOWING THEM TO DRINK. I ALSO BELIEVE THE STATE SHOULD NOT MANDATE THAT EMPLOYEE SHOULD BE PRESENT THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE WHERE THERE'S PEOPLE GETTING STONED. OR THEY CAN GET STONE FROM SECONDHAND SMOKE. SO WITH THAT YOU KNOW YOU SAY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU I THINK THAT YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK I KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN A PROTECTION MODE. FOR THOSE FOR THE PUBLIC. HAVE BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE THE HIGHWAY PATROL COME THROUGH THAT STUDY MONEY. FOR THE DRIVING IMPAIRED GOING FORWARD WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
