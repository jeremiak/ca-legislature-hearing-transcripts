00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:44.603

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.874

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:58.651
We've been learning and it's

00:11:58.717 --> 00:11:59.218
not perfect that and so I

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:00.653
understand the frustration and

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:02.421
the work that's ahead and so I

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:02.988
don't want to minimize that.

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:04.824
But I have seen some progress

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.792
out there. And I am committed

supervisors to lease- and one

00:12:42.628 --> 00:12:43.195
thing the community really for

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:44.430
and all the commuter

00:12:44.497 --> 00:12:44.964

resurrection community and- I

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:50.870
started list and I'm we'd we'd

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:52.338
be here for awhile because-

00:12:52.404 --> 00:12:52.972
this is been a long challenge

00:12:53.038 --> 00:12:54.874
and if you are is aggravated

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.477
and upset. And is frustrated at

00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:00.446
not getting done quickly and

00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:02.982
fast. Believe me it's the same

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:03.616
feeling people have here. And

00:13:03.682 --> 00:13:04.717
part of this part of this.

00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:06.719
Coming here tonight. Is to add

00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:08.754
the pressure to get this done

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:10.923
quicker now we have a real

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.658
unique opportunity it in the

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:14.460
sense that were still dog on

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:16.595
getting this thing done. I am

00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:17.129
getting it done in the

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:18.697
quickest- most rapid way

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:20.900
possible. I know we also have a

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.501
new in from director over the

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:24.570
TSC. So there's a real

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.605
opportunity- for embracing a

00:13:26.672 --> 00:13:28.474
new approach to this in asking

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:29.041
the real tough questions at

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:30.743
this point in time right. Why

00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:32.411
is it costing so long why why

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:34.613
is it taking so long- where

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.515
their answers that suffice we

00:13:36.582 --> 00:13:37.116
accept them with those answers

00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:40.853
that don't suffice- we don't

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.453
accept them when we challenge

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.555
those things. On it and our

00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:44.690
colleagues here. I believe the

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:46.825
been support of our recent

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:48.727
efforts certainly. I know as as

00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:49.195
our community members

00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:50.663
organizations- and supervise

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:54.600
least audit- do TST. As it

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:59.004
relates to. Only introduced-

00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:02.608
the letter. And will continue

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.443
to make sure to try to advocate

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:04.944
that the- that the state

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.779
legislature. Voted up so that

00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:09.215
the- stick- honor can actually

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:10.916
do it's working on it. And it

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:13.018
will be able to come back with

00:14:13.085 --> 00:14:14.453
best practices. And what really

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.455
did happen and what's going on

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.524
so when I can. Thank you one

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:19.058
more time for continued-

00:14:19.124 --> 00:14:20.926
advocacy. I can't say enough

00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:21.427
that I live in the same

00:14:21.493 --> 00:14:24.730
neighborhood. And granted my

00:14:24.797 --> 00:14:26.732
kids have not. Been alive as

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:28.601
long as some of you have been.

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:30.436
Fighting with this good fight

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:31.036
but the impacts are real. I'm

00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:32.905
not within the one point seven

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:34.940
miles- the but I would agree

00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:37.009
that you. That that they still

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:38.777
have an impact. Or land like to

00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:40.779
along some of the- toughest.

00:14:40.846 --> 00:14:42.514
Neighborhoods is released the

00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:44.717

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:52.758
thousand cars driving in our

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:53.392

community and we actually have

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:53.172
found that the more directly we

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:55.174
can hear from the community the

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.909
better off we are in terms of

00:17:56.975 --> 00:17:59.111

variances and their concerns

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:06.752
and yes their frustrations. A

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:10.756
few weeks ago I had a chance to

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:12.925
come down and visit some area

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:14.927
residents and also to meet with

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:17.129
some members of the work crews

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:18.997
who had gone through the

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:20.899
workforce development program.

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:22.701
Part way through the day

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.937
Andreas Andres Martinez who in

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:26.939
his or somewhere- who leads are

00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:28.974
workforce development team

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:32.744
program team- commented about

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:34.847
the number of stories that have

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:35.481
come out in the course of doing

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:38.784
this clean up work. And I'm

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:39.451
sure you more than I have heard

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:42.688
stories of loss and of illness

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:45.224
and of the told contamination

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.125
takes. On the people who live

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:50.729
in the scan these communities.

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:51.330
Throughout the day I did hear

00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:52.998
other stories. I got to see the

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:55.934
closeness that is develops

00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:58.804
sometimes between a resident

00:18:58.871 --> 00:18:59.471
and the staff member buys them

00:18:59.538 --> 00:19:01.340
shoot through the clean up

00:19:01.406 --> 00:19:04.710
process. I heard families talk

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:07.112
about going to great lengths.

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:07.679
To take care of their pets

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:10.782
during the clean up. One

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:12.784
resident told me she can now

00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:13.418
host family gatherings in our

00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:14.987
backyard without fear of.

00:19:15.053 --> 00:19:18.957
Letting poisoning for her

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.859
family and another resident

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:22.861
another- couple talked about

00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:24.796
how they now have divided their

00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:26.899
responsibilities for

00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:28.901
maintaining their their yard-

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:31.303
an integrated into their daily

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.171
routine. I also heard from

00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:35.040
three brothers who found the

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:38.043
that work on the clean up

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.877
through the work program and

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:40.913
talk they talked about what

00:19:40.979 --> 00:19:42.948
have what happened steady

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:44.750
employment has meant to them.

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:46.919
And it was really quite.

00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:49.121
Affecting and I think all of

00:19:49.187 --> 00:19:51.089
these stories really represent

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:53.191
how internet the work we're

00:19:53.258 --> 00:19:55.093
doing is. We're entering

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.029
people's homes were helping

00:19:57.095 --> 00:20:00.799
them relocate pets were talking

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.801
to them about why it's so

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:04.903
important to me ups done.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.072
People are placing a lot of

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:09.474
trust in us. And we take that

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:09.975
responsibility very very

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.945
seriously. And we can only do

00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:14.913
this work if we maintain some

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.915
deep level of engagement with

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:18.951
the community so we're

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:19.451
constantly striving to

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:21.119
strengthen that can our

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:24.957
communication. And to do better.

00:20:25.023 --> 00:20:25.524
The residential clean up is

00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:27.059
progressing settling we're now

00:20:27.125 --> 00:20:27.559
able to clean up about a

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:31.063
hundred properties along. We

00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:33.165
don't have any we haven't

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:34.800
encountered many so significant

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:35.400
technical issues with the red

00:20:35.467 --> 00:20:38.837
presidential clean up recently.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.872
Our priority is to clean up as

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:43.175
many homes as possible and to

00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:43.709
that end we streamlined a

00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:47.045
number of our- some aspects of

00:20:47.112 --> 00:20:49.114
the process and- simplified

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:51.149
some things and we also think

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:51.750
that will help drive down the

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:55.087
cost because as we said. The

00:20:55.153 --> 00:20:57.289
priority is to clean up as many

00:20:57.356 --> 00:20:59.157
homes as possible and so we're

00:20:59.224 --> 00:21:01.560
being. Increasingly aggressive

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:04.930
about containing costs. We're

00:21:04.997 --> 00:21:05.497
doing our best manage the

00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:07.232
budget but we are facing some

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:11.336
high contractor costs and

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:12.904
project cost increases. This

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:13.572
evening in addition to talking

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:15.474
about the facility in the

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.109
residential clean up and will

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:19.378
provide- will to this evening

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:21.546
will also provide information

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:23.081
about how the facility closures

00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:25.083
going an update you on that so

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.185
there is a lot to discuss. And

00:21:27.252 --> 00:21:29.321
before I get to that just one

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:31.223
more story which is that toward

00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:33.225
the end of the visit when I was

00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:35.093
out- visiting various

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.095
properties a group of young

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:39.097
school girls walked by in their

00:21:39.164 --> 00:21:39.698
school uniforms on their way

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:41.133
home from school. And I

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:43.368
actually started wondering what

00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:45.103
their stories were. On whether

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.940
their homes in been remediated.

00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:49.574
Was it okay for them to play in

00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:53.545
their backyards. What what is

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:55.047
the lead done an impacted how

00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:57.049
it impacted them. Gave me

00:21:57.115 --> 00:21:59.251
pause- we understand the

00:21:59.317 --> 00:22:03.055
importance of this work. And

00:22:03.121 --> 00:22:03.488
it's has to be done

00:22:03.555 --> 00:22:05.257
collectively has to be done in

00:22:05.323 --> 00:22:07.359
a ship with everyone who's here

00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:09.261
this evening. And this is

00:22:09.327 --> 00:22:11.296
another opportunity to really

00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:13.298
strengthen the that partnership

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:15.367
and- continue to work so with

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:17.069
that I'll turn to the

00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:31.983

age meant around that. Will on

00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:59.478
the force. At which point out

Like if you go yeah this this

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:11.857
is what. Before we begin the

00:23:11.923 --> 00:23:17.529
clean process. And is there the

00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:18.130
three segments were there and

00:23:18.196 --> 00:23:19.765
this is a picture that was in

00:23:19.831 --> 00:23:21.333
in October- and as you the

00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:25.504
segment one long hair. And

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.239
focused on segment one segment

00:23:27.305 --> 00:23:29.474
yeah I do- some of the crop

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:31.643
attention to say to into the

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.879
coverage the sweets maybe

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:37.349
artist but there is covering-

00:23:37.415 --> 00:23:39.785
of the pull up structure there

00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:45.390
and up isn't yours in that. In

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:49.427
that include. That of it. The

00:23:49.494 --> 00:23:50.061
approach for the demolition and

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:51.396
clean up the first the to do

00:23:51.463 --> 00:23:53.565
that we can phases the for

00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:57.369
phases to address all of. Route

00:23:57.435 --> 00:23:59.404
structures and the deep

00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:01.239
structure in the D. emanation.

00:24:01.306 --> 00:24:05.777
And we're- moving. And bring

00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:07.546
that back to be we take great

00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:09.414
pains to make sure that the

00:24:09.481 --> 00:24:12.050
work. Done so please and this

00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:15.453
work X. is risk some of and

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.257
it's higher labor. The cost and-

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:21.827
state funded being for that for

00:24:21.893 --> 00:24:27.599
this work. Dahle about ground

00:24:27.666 --> 00:24:28.233
structures will merge into the

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:32.103
low and. Can and do an

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.273
assessment autumn report clean

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.375
and that as after we that there

00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:41.413
may be a phase three is needed.

00:24:41.479 --> 00:24:43.515
So with respect to phase one.

00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:47.552
And that that stays is more

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:49.588
than percent complete. At this

00:24:49.654 --> 00:24:53.558
point on. We can one since

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:57.562
twenty six. And but we are

00:24:57.629 --> 00:24:59.798
significantly behind regional

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:01.733
time estimate schedule or how

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.735
long it would to do work. Fact

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:07.606
team months and the of the low

00:25:07.672 --> 00:25:11.776
the- amount on it will be. This

00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:13.612
one moment cation will be were

00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:15.947
bring exile do. Us one permit

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:19.351
modification on a scale change.

00:25:19.417 --> 00:25:23.521
As we got. In the one tale up

00:25:23.588 --> 00:25:25.323
review of this proposed

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:25.924
schedule change in the in and

00:25:25.991 --> 00:25:29.060
public comment period so- look

00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:29.694
for that and would be happy to

00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:31.596
report on on that as as it goes

00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:37.235
forward. So and then I didn't

00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:41.439
want me to. In order and then I

00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:43.842
want to- talk a bit about the

00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:45.343
facility in closure as I

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.614
mentioned- and as the slide

00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:51.549
illustrates there have been. In

00:25:51.616 --> 00:25:55.754
they've been great cost. In the

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.624
unit yeah- they are a polity

00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:03.662
when happens is an air quality.

00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:05.563
Violation and it's all so- over

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.666
the procedures that putting

00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:09.801
putting the for free and fair

00:26:09.868 --> 00:26:11.770
and then a second bridge. The

00:26:11.836 --> 00:26:13.838
end of your- and- after the

00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:17.742
first pre. Coast it is a

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:19.945
violation and we be December.

00:26:20.011 --> 00:26:25.583
The second bridge are you in

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.953
January should. More than a

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:30.055
statement late we actually have

00:26:30.121 --> 00:26:33.725
recall them back look at this.

00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:37.829
For your- the- issue is so that

00:26:37.896 --> 00:26:39.998
the would tell us where is

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:43.735
being added I'm and skin and

00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:45.870
then all of. But certain things

00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:47.772
are really forced to be those

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:53.778
bono. Is a- to be thank fact

00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:55.880
have drinks at work actually

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:59.584
complete leave me. So keep an

00:26:59.651 --> 00:27:03.922
eye on. And closure and make

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:11.596
sure. To stand. On you know the

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:19.804
is get back to a drop this is.

00:27:19.871 --> 00:27:23.708
To be invest mission D. R. X.

00:27:23.775 --> 00:27:25.577
is responsible for doctor

00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:27.312
thorough testing hello

00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:31.383
contamination old enough. And

00:27:31.449 --> 00:27:33.551
they needed an of what we Rick

00:27:33.618 --> 00:27:35.420
refusal investing to us deemed

00:27:35.487 --> 00:27:37.622
it it in at. And as a result we

00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:39.357
reject that were and have take

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:41.426
taken steps to take to make

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:41.860
sure that a proper

00:27:41.926 --> 00:27:43.628
investigation gets done and

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:45.730
also what we call a corrective

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:47.599
measures study- however excite

00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:49.601
is disputing our determination

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:53.571
that that- that that. Are a

00:27:53.638 --> 00:27:55.373
five- report that report is

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.076
insufficient and were in

00:27:58.143 --> 00:27:59.310
dispute resolution resolution

00:27:59.377 --> 00:28:01.312
process nevertheless were

00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:03.281
working to make sure that that.

00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:03.915
The things are in place of that

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:05.550
that investigation can be

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:09.421
completed properly. That's

00:28:09.487 --> 00:28:11.322
where we are with the facility.

00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:15.794
And move on to the park ways

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:21.533
and the residential areas. And

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:24.269
it's been about the ways should

00:28:24.335 --> 00:28:27.939
spend is but where are of and

00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:31.943
that getting Burke wasted

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.611
levels of can nation taking act

00:28:33.678 --> 00:28:37.782
if completed the same. Of ways

00:28:37.849 --> 00:28:41.686
and- we also issue next year.

00:28:41.753 --> 00:28:45.590
So for our because men and it

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:49.494
actually up in for. The good

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:54.099
stand how. Breaks loose news.

00:28:54.165 --> 00:28:56.034
Part is important to the right

00:28:56.101 --> 00:29:01.606
so done that we talked asking

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:05.743
to help is the ways. Buses

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:11.850
address in Europe all got of.

00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:12.350
We expect out of those

00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:15.820
documents available by summer a

00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:17.956
and a public com. Into the

00:29:18.022 --> 00:29:23.962
clean out based for the rest.

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:24.596
The residents clean up yeah I

00:29:24.662 --> 00:29:26.030
think it when he as well

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:30.001
miglior with with the- one

00:29:30.068 --> 00:29:36.074
seven preliminary invest. There

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:37.775
are if we take a number there

00:29:37.842 --> 00:29:39.844
are more than a thousand

00:29:39.911 --> 00:29:42.113
missiles within them one point

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.149
seven mile radius with a simple

00:29:44.215 --> 00:29:47.519
for the five hundred of the

00:29:47.585 --> 00:29:49.721
house. And as of this week the

00:29:49.787 --> 00:29:53.725
teen hundred X. the properties.

00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:55.994
There are six hundred thirty

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.797
still. There we have not. Where

00:29:59.864 --> 00:30:01.666
we have not been going back to

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:03.735
sample board to do clean. Right

00:30:03.801 --> 00:30:07.805
now we have three three. Is an

00:30:07.872 --> 00:30:10.074
old and says that's been done

00:30:10.141 --> 00:30:14.112
to contractors allows us to get

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:16.114
a hundred. I want to talk a

00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:18.349
little bit about what process

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:22.153
look like. And what steps we go

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.955
through when we clean up. First

00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:26.257
is the and permission to sample

00:30:26.324 --> 00:30:30.161
and- up and door property Asian

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:32.230
special school board and

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:36.000
convert shins folks in the

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:44.042
process what. It moved. He for

00:30:44.108 --> 00:30:47.679
instance after in the process

00:30:47.745 --> 00:30:51.549
of the to be okay and I don't

00:30:51.616 --> 00:30:52.150
buy into choices for what for

00:30:52.217 --> 00:30:53.585
they want in proper and work

00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:55.486
out all the D. and the

00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:57.522
scheduling details and once

00:30:57.589 --> 00:30:59.691
that's all done Reese schedule

00:30:59.757 --> 00:31:01.793
the clean up again working very

00:31:01.859 --> 00:31:03.428
closely with the resident

00:31:03.494 --> 00:31:05.597
making sure that- they can

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:07.632
manage the logistics and

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:09.534
whatever else it's just

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:11.436
obviously very destructive to-

00:31:11.502 --> 00:31:13.738
day to day lives and so we've

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:16.241
taken a great deal care with

00:31:16.307 --> 00:31:17.575
the scheduling. And then.

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:19.911
Eventually of course the clean

00:31:19.978 --> 00:31:21.846
up clean up crews go into the

00:31:21.913 --> 00:31:23.414
field and do the work the

00:31:23.481 --> 00:31:25.416
excavation and the remediation

00:31:25.483 --> 00:31:30.154
and- after that's done we do.

00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:32.090
Sit down with the resident

00:31:32.156 --> 00:31:33.691
confirm that the clean up

00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:35.627
workers comp the we have

00:31:35.693 --> 00:31:37.562
quality check lists- and we

00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:39.864
make sure that. Everything's in

00:31:39.931 --> 00:31:42.033
order. So you can see there are

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.534
a lot of touch points

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:44.202
throughout this process so it's

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:45.870
really not possible to get this

00:31:45.937 --> 00:31:47.839
work done for not in good

00:31:47.905 --> 00:31:48.306
communication with the

00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:54.379
community. And I want to talk

00:31:54.445 --> 00:32:00.118
about. It more- there's just.

00:32:00.184 --> 00:32:02.387
The site it is to our- water

00:32:02.453 --> 00:32:04.422
order do. Or not and where to

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:08.359
get thanks you. Understood the

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:12.397
problem the- we have a local

00:32:12.463 --> 00:32:16.167
person com. House be more

00:32:16.234 --> 00:32:22.173
simple. Do a number mail I do

make sure that when folks go

00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:32.470

to some basic yeah this call so.

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:08.306
We are- we're needing with the

00:35:08.372 --> 00:35:10.441
low jurisdiction. We help local

00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:12.743

lead abatement program it's a

00:35:23.888 --> 00:35:28.059
very active. So I want to

00:35:28.125 --> 00:35:29.694
switch gears a bit and talk a

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.228
little bit on a workforce

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:32.196
development program the

00:35:32.263 --> 00:35:32.763
workforce for environmental

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:34.499
restoration and communities

00:35:34.565 --> 00:35:38.302
this is a program that spent.

00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:42.273
The rest of us. Anyway is a-

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:48.479
and have have Gen. Make sure

00:35:48.546 --> 00:35:50.581
the community itself Bennett

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:56.554
that's begin. The clean up and

00:35:56.621 --> 00:36:02.527
so of course look for. It is

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:06.163
through for Gramm leach. Either

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:08.533
with. Investigation finds quite

00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:12.303
a number of a that we set our

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.672
local one. Get perfect in terms

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:18.309
of getting in program again.

00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:22.580
Being an- the room at the end

00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:26.417
this point on a team going up

00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:28.486
well I have a chance to with a

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:34.492
number of. Who had through

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:38.563
program and are. Seventy one

00:36:38.629 --> 00:36:42.199
graduate. We've gone through

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:46.304
six words different folks-

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:54.345
since. More clean up right now

00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:58.382
there. One work is done the

00:36:58.449 --> 00:37:00.418
proper. At the project uber

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:04.021
manly people are getting up we

00:37:04.088 --> 00:37:08.259
and- and that get the community

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:10.361
Russell are benefiting from the

00:37:10.428 --> 00:37:13.898
this opportunity as our hope is

00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:14.532
that of course in the long run

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:18.336
backed- this will lead to other.

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:20.605
Opportunities other employment

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:22.273
opportunities perhaps through

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.609
the union there are many other

00:37:24.675 --> 00:37:26.410
avenues of folks continue to do

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:28.045
this kind workers and tell

00:37:28.112 --> 00:37:30.314
there were three. Once have

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:34.318
experience. So that's where we

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:36.220
are with the residential and

00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:38.556
the- in the park with clean up

00:37:38.623 --> 00:37:40.091
and at this point grant will

00:37:40.157 --> 00:37:42.560
talk to you about the dollars

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:52.169
and cents. I'll be talking

00:37:52.236 --> 00:37:53.904
about the budget the contracts

00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:56.107
for the residential clean up

00:37:56.173 --> 00:38:00.111
right now we start with about

00:38:00.177 --> 00:38:00.645
one million dollars with

00:38:00.711 --> 00:38:02.279
expanded about a hundred fifty

00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:04.115
seven million dollars that

four million dollars for the

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:12.189
remainder of the clean up.

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:14.358
About 81% money expand that's

00:38:14.425 --> 00:38:16.794
far has been for the clean up

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:20.498
of Ste well. The person has

00:38:20.564 --> 00:38:22.700
been for ample for and of the

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:24.635
money that we spend. Ridley to

00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:28.572
clean up our act please. One or

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:40.317
clean up. Prop. The cops are-

00:38:40.384 --> 00:38:44.689
for but at this. Thank you the

00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:50.494
drop for. Contract we go in to

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:54.465
on the contrary we- both in

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:58.469
contract manage social help.

00:38:58.536 --> 00:39:02.573
Okay the country of. As well

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:08.412
the way we- that's costs were

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:12.683
most. And to drop. What is the

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:16.687
time of con is. Time there if

00:39:16.754 --> 00:39:20.491
you were was not workers will.

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:24.628
Office the next it. The does

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:28.399
tend of I track only in a

00:39:28.466 --> 00:39:34.672
really. Cost is in a. Isn't it

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:36.907
over to. Cost play cost

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:40.511
materials have priest so.

00:39:40.578 --> 00:39:44.582
Project it is center very long

00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:46.917
black. Even if the price this

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:54.058
is the is it normal to cost per.

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:56.293
If you find term time material.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.696
In context of the work you're

00:39:58.763 --> 00:39:59.330
doing and what a as opposed to

00:39:59.396 --> 00:40:02.199
it different of concept. Yes in

00:40:02.266 --> 00:40:04.135
a time of contract you'll to go

00:40:04.201 --> 00:40:06.203
out for the day and do a

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.506
property let's say takes them

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:10.407
ten hours to do the work and

00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:12.309
they move- fifty cubic yards

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:16.480
off the site. They will charge

00:40:16.547 --> 00:40:18.649
you for the full ten hours. And

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.384
they'll charge you to Holloway

00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:20.918
those fifty cubic yards of

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:22.787
material. I won said another

00:40:22.853 --> 00:40:24.421
site it takes them twelve

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:26.524
hours. To declare the property

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:30.027
and- the Holloway eighty cubic

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:32.129
yards of material. So they're

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:32.696
gonna charge you increased

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:34.498
amounts of money because around

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:36.033
the field longer in the movie

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.135
more material. That contrast

00:40:38.202 --> 00:40:40.037
rather sharply with- type of-

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:42.173
contractor we're trying to move

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:42.773
into which is called the unit

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.275
price contract. That's where

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:46.410
all of the costs for certain

00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:47.011
activities are spelled out in

00:40:47.077 --> 00:40:50.181
the contract itself. To going

00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:50.748
in and sampling. That's it

00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:52.383
that's a set price. Moving

00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:55.386
certain amount as well that's a

00:40:55.452 --> 00:40:56.587
set price it just provides more

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:58.455
certainty for the state. For

00:40:58.522 --> 00:40:59.023
the amount of work that they

00:40:59.089 --> 00:41:00.524
can pay. For any particular

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:05.095
clean up. So I can see where-

00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:06.630
there may be cost savings in

00:41:06.697 --> 00:41:10.267
the second kind of contract but.

00:41:10.334 --> 00:41:12.236
The time and materials contract

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:14.271
would seem to incentivize the

00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:16.207
possibility of spending more

00:41:16.273 --> 00:41:16.774
time the necessary on a job

00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:20.344
site- but on the flip side. The

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:24.248
other contract. Could influence

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:26.317
in the opposite direction wise

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:28.118
one preferable over the other

00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:30.321
night soon there's oversight

00:41:30.387 --> 00:41:32.523
that's provided on uncle there

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:33.090
is a credit card. That you

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:34.225
you're absolutely right

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:36.560
troubling we have people out in

00:41:36.627 --> 00:41:40.264
the overseeing the work done by

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:44.168
contractors- we- not not only

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:46.503
had have what we call- we've

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:48.305
got engineers you know other

00:41:48.372 --> 00:41:50.140
individuals who will go and-

00:41:50.207 --> 00:41:52.443
look at the quality of work

00:41:52.509 --> 00:41:53.077
that they've done. Make certain

00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:54.245
that they're doing it according

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:54.845
to the clean a plan that we

00:41:54.912 --> 00:41:56.547
produced for this for this

00:41:56.614 --> 00:42:00.451
project we also have other

00:42:00.517 --> 00:42:02.219
quality controls which I can go

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:02.820
into a little bit. Where we

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:04.588
have when you say we are

00:42:04.655 --> 00:42:06.223
talking about DTS city crier

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.325
department clear. Independent

00:42:08.392 --> 00:42:12.129
of the contractor overseeing

00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:12.730
that work that's right. That's

00:42:12.796 --> 00:42:14.498
right. We also this is

00:42:14.565 --> 00:42:16.300
important when a when a project

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.402
is done we'll go back and walk

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:20.437
through the property with the-

00:42:20.504 --> 00:42:22.506
individual who lives there. To

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:24.375
make certain that the project

00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:26.710
itself- got a list it's called

00:42:26.777 --> 00:42:28.445
a punch last will go down it

00:42:28.512 --> 00:42:30.214
just took off or something is

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:32.249
not- up to par for that

00:42:32.316 --> 00:42:32.883
individual. And then will work

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:36.153
to try and correct that-

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:42.326
whatever that problem is. Thank.

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:48.332
Questions to- arctic now. The

00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:48.899
it's just a curiosity right

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:52.403
because I would. I'd I I'd ask

00:42:52.469 --> 00:42:54.571
you know why do we think about

00:42:54.638 --> 00:42:56.640
the most efficient ways of

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:57.141
doing it from the very

00:42:57.207 --> 00:42:57.775
beginning instead of looking at

00:42:57.841 --> 00:42:58.442
the most efficient ways later.

00:42:58.509 --> 00:43:00.778
I'm not I'm not that technical

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:01.378
expert on contracts right and

00:43:01.445 --> 00:43:04.148
I'm not. That you won I did

00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:04.648
speak with my previous

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:06.617
experience service community

00:43:06.684 --> 00:43:07.151
college for dealing with

00:43:07.217 --> 00:43:10.387
project managers told me that

00:43:10.454 --> 00:43:10.988
there's a number of different

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:11.655
contracts that can be set up in

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:14.391
the onset right- you have open

00:43:14.458 --> 00:43:16.427
book which will be laid out in

00:43:16.493 --> 00:43:18.362
you determine the profit based

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:18.996
on open books and the different

00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:20.631
names for them but they all get

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:22.766
the same thing- person-

00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:24.468
percentage of profit. That

00:43:24.535 --> 00:43:25.035
everybody agrees on Ansett

00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:32.643
price- there is a there's-

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.445
would you say- there's a set up

00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:36.747
amount and then it just depends

00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:38.816
on how fission- program

00:43:38.882 --> 00:43:40.651
managers are the maximize their

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:42.753
space in order to get the

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.455
largest amount of a profit

00:43:44.521 --> 00:43:48.592
possible- and then there's a

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:50.694
set- well there's a number of

00:43:50.761 --> 00:43:52.830
other will try but- the one

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:54.565
that at least efficient always

00:43:54.631 --> 00:43:56.467
is the one that charges. Yeah

00:43:56.533 --> 00:43:57.034
because the way it in in

00:43:57.101 --> 00:43:58.569
oftentimes it's the highest

00:43:58.635 --> 00:44:00.637
burn ratio on the program

00:44:00.704 --> 00:44:04.508
manager side in. Ali a maybe

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:05.142
you are directly involved in

00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:06.677
that but if I can understand

00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:08.445
that I'm wondering how do you

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:09.079
TNC could not understand that

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:10.781
from the very beginning could

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:12.916
we struggled all the same

00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:13.517
things we came on and- we-

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:18.622
completely reformed. S. and it

00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:20.591
is difficult for me to

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:22.526
understand how how these things

00:44:22.593 --> 00:44:24.528
could have been caught. Day one

00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:26.530
in knowing the most efficient

00:44:26.597 --> 00:44:28.365
ways to actually do a contract.

00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:28.999
Yeah I know some remember- so

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:30.734
you're absolutely right my

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:32.536
understanding is the department

00:44:32.603 --> 00:44:34.705
did try to go through a number

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:36.440
of different. More set price

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:38.776
contract structures here's the

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:42.780
problem this is one of the

00:44:42.846 --> 00:44:44.681
largest most complex clean ups

00:44:44.748 --> 00:44:46.383
if not the largest most complex

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.585
clean up that details he is

00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:50.354
done and they clean up hundreds

00:44:50.421 --> 00:44:50.888
and hundreds of sites all

00:44:50.954 --> 00:44:52.656
across the state. When you're

00:44:52.723 --> 00:44:54.658
trying to construct a contract.

00:44:54.725 --> 00:44:56.460
For that type of- very

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:58.629
logistically complex and by

00:44:58.695 --> 00:45:00.397
that I mean. Each one of these

00:45:00.464 --> 00:45:00.998
parcels that is being cleaned

00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:04.368
up is different. And so when

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:06.770
you're trying to construct that

00:45:06.837 --> 00:45:08.372
without. Information that

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:08.939
people can use to gauge how

00:45:09.006 --> 00:45:10.841
much money a particular parcel

00:45:10.908 --> 00:45:14.711
will cost. It's tremendously

00:45:14.778 --> 00:45:16.513
difficult to get a contractor

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.114
to actually sign the contract

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:19.049
because for them. The potential

00:45:19.116 --> 00:45:20.684
exposures huge if they agree to

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:22.519
clean up say five on a

00:45:22.586 --> 00:45:24.388
properties. And they come up

00:45:24.455 --> 00:45:24.955
with an estimate on a per

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:26.824
parcel basis that turned out to

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:28.725
be wrong even on the margins a

00:45:28.792 --> 00:45:30.627
couple hundred dollars five

00:45:30.694 --> 00:45:31.161
hundred dollars thousand

00:45:31.228 --> 00:45:32.629
dollars suddenly their

00:45:32.696 --> 00:45:34.798
exposures far beyond what their

00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:35.332
risk model would otherwise

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:36.633
except to what what did he is

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.502
he did was they tried to come

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:39.069
up with that you know price

00:45:39.136 --> 00:45:40.671
contract at first. But they

00:45:40.737 --> 00:45:42.539
just didn't have enough

00:45:42.606 --> 00:45:43.207
information because they hadn't

00:45:43.273 --> 00:45:46.543
cleaned up. You know five five

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:47.010
hundred eight hundred

00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:48.378
properties so what they did in

00:45:48.445 --> 00:45:48.846
particular I'd of the

00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:49.446
tremendous amount of pressure

00:45:49.513 --> 00:45:50.914
on the department actually

00:45:50.981 --> 00:45:52.950
deliver the cleanups. Because

00:45:53.016 --> 00:45:54.485
up until that time they've gone

00:45:54.551 --> 00:45:56.487
through the E. I. R. process.

00:45:56.553 --> 00:45:58.755
Which which is great comply

00:45:58.822 --> 00:46:03.060
with state law. Back to a time.

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:03.727
Then they were in a position of

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:04.561
trying to develop a com the-

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:06.797
contract one of the largest

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:08.765
cleanups ever undertaken in the

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:10.667
state and people wanted to see

00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:12.636
shot on the ground and so they

00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:14.471
made a decision that would

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:15.038
enter into a time materials

00:46:15.105 --> 00:46:16.807
contract. And also bring on

00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:18.709
contract consultants to help

00:46:18.775 --> 00:46:20.844
them both trying constrictors

00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:23.213
costs but also over time once

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.815
they knew more about that the

00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:27.217
kind of the risks inherent in

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:28.886
cleaning up properties that

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:31.255
they were trying to do a better

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:42.432
contract contact structure. Is

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:48.672
that the- answer. To going to

00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:52.843
the next slide. There's some

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:53.477
additional activities of lead

00:46:53.544 --> 00:46:55.045
to increased- clean up costs

00:46:55.112 --> 00:46:57.281
that are just. Kind of inherent

00:46:57.347 --> 00:46:59.082
within the- Daschle project

00:46:59.149 --> 00:47:04.988
itself. In the case can you to.

00:47:05.055 --> 00:47:08.892
Mobilizing remote eyes again

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:13.230
and then and that time. Sample

00:47:13.297 --> 00:47:13.830
there is in the house dollars

00:47:13.897 --> 00:47:21.071
are there are. Spent on being

00:47:21.138 --> 00:47:21.705
their allies honest cleaning up

00:47:21.772 --> 00:47:25.075
so some of to be expected. We

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:30.614
up. Guards we can we want to

00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:32.816
and I'm- the time and force

00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:35.118
duration this is their home so

00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:36.720
we necessarily have to be

00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:38.822
flexible scheduling but when we

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:40.724
do that there's an inherent

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:42.659
costs and that's just part of.

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:44.494
Working in an urban environment

00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:46.897
where you're actually digging

00:47:46.964 --> 00:47:49.132
up people's yards there's

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:50.601
change there's changes have

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:51.134
been made and landscaping

00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:52.869
materials. That has a cat

00:47:52.936 --> 00:47:55.072
coming. Because if you you plan

00:47:55.138 --> 00:47:56.873
for a certain amount of clean

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.042
ups over a week. And if people

00:47:59.109 --> 00:48:01.011
modify their request for say

00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:03.013
them out of sight in the yard

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.681
or they wanna go from side to

00:48:04.748 --> 00:48:06.550
rocks. You'll you'll have to

00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:07.150
purchase that potentially on

00:48:07.217 --> 00:48:09.052
the spot or you'll have to make

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:09.620
certain that you have that

00:48:09.686 --> 00:48:11.321
moment. Actually cover those

00:48:11.388 --> 00:48:12.789
properties if you don't then

00:48:12.856 --> 00:48:15.092
you go out and buy it so all of

00:48:15.158 --> 00:48:18.495
that also increases costs

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:20.497
there's- normal interact

00:48:20.564 --> 00:48:21.131
interruptions for work such as

00:48:21.198 --> 00:48:26.670
rain delays etcetera. So

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:27.237
recognizing this week we've

00:48:27.304 --> 00:48:30.674
taken steps. Already to reduce

00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:33.010
costs and burn in the midst of

00:48:33.076 --> 00:48:35.112
the kind of final negotiation

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:37.047
period with some one of the

00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:40.484
contractors to transition from

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:42.686
a time in which- contract to

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:44.855
unifies contract. That's really

00:48:44.921 --> 00:48:46.723
the biggest cost driver right

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:47.357
now we've taken other steps to

00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:48.892
reduce costs but just in terms

00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:50.927
of overall impact. That's

00:48:50.994 --> 00:48:57.000
really where we have our I sat.

00:48:57.067 --> 00:48:59.036
And then park was funding-

00:48:59.102 --> 00:49:01.371
legislature six point five

00:49:01.438 --> 00:49:05.475
million. Dollars to do both as

00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:09.046
well clean up. We can as- your

00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:11.381
outlines state we clip pleaded

00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:13.183
the leads twenty four the

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:17.120
number is. Expect about were we

00:49:17.187 --> 00:49:19.256
needed which would we gonna

00:49:19.323 --> 00:49:19.890
spend one point two million the

00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:25.095
next. The next big step

00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:27.197
process. On a contractor to

00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:38.742
actually for parks. That's

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:40.711
that's what we're here for you

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:41.345
today and we're happy to answer

00:49:41.411 --> 00:49:42.979
any additional questions

00:49:43.046 --> 00:49:48.885
clarify things. Yes a he said

00:49:48.952 --> 00:49:49.453
that you were working on a

00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:51.121
contract change it's one of the

00:49:51.188 --> 00:49:52.889
two contractors appealing which

00:49:52.956 --> 00:49:58.628
contractors that. It's Parsons.

00:49:58.695 --> 00:50:03.166
Okay can. I had the pleasure of

00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:03.667
attending year community

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:05.168
hearing in the city about only

00:50:05.235 --> 00:50:07.070
to see some of year passes

00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:10.607
between the two contractors in

00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:11.108
person being much more

00:50:11.174 --> 00:50:14.845
expensive- all along the way

00:50:14.911 --> 00:50:17.047
and concerns about even who

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:20.884
with the contract the- people

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:23.019
there to oversee that contract

00:50:23.086 --> 00:50:23.587
and so forth where there was

00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:26.790
some sort of. Indirect and

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:27.391
direct take to Parsons- along

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:29.192
the way and they spend. A lot

00:50:29.259 --> 00:50:30.927
of concerns about the Parsons

00:50:30.994 --> 00:50:32.763
contract in particular so in

00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:34.698
addition to make in the type of

00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:36.800
contract. A putting other safe

00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:38.935
crisis there to address some of

00:50:39.002 --> 00:50:46.843
the community concerns. So by

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:47.377
some of the other can you

00:50:47.444 --> 00:50:49.045
concerns- one of the things

00:50:49.112 --> 00:50:50.914
that we've heard is when

00:50:50.981 --> 00:50:51.515
something is damaged on the

00:50:51.581 --> 00:50:53.183
property they want to make

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.818
certain. It's actually fixed.

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:57.087
And so we do a process whereby

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:59.122
we work with the people who

00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:01.024
live on the site. And if

00:51:01.091 --> 00:51:02.959
something is damaged. We've got

00:51:03.026 --> 00:51:05.061
that punch list that we go

00:51:05.128 --> 00:51:08.865
through we noted. And then we

00:51:08.932 --> 00:51:13.103
work with the contractors. To

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:13.737
make whatever middle steps we

00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:15.071
can to address that that

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:18.975
problem another can I just ask

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:20.844
a clarifying question are you

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:22.779
are you are you hearing

00:51:22.846 --> 00:51:24.714
concerns about oversight of

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:27.083
persons that's the so that's

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:28.952
part of your question is yeah

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:29.553
not just with the cost of the

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:31.221
actual oversight of the work

00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:32.722
you're doing it right being

00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:36.760
safe if- and so there's been.

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:37.294
Different such as average

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.196
that'll have one or the other

00:51:39.262 --> 00:51:41.231
and what we care the most

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:41.898
concerned about the work that's

00:51:41.965 --> 00:51:43.200
actually being done has been

00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:45.035
tied to presence I do want to

00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:47.003
speak to the safety issue

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:47.704
because this does come up and I

00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:49.206
know there is a bit of. Fusion

00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:52.943
because- folks look around at

00:51:53.009 --> 00:51:54.911
the properties as a getting

00:51:54.978 --> 00:51:55.479
cleaned up and they may see

00:51:55.545 --> 00:51:56.746
people wearing different types

00:51:56.813 --> 00:51:57.247
of safety protect in a

00:51:57.314 --> 00:51:59.182
protective equipment. And it's

00:51:59.249 --> 00:52:03.019
confusing to folks- because

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:04.855
depending on what stage the at

00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:06.823
what stage the cleanup is. This

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.992
is the step the workers may be

00:52:09.059 --> 00:52:10.894
wearing booties they may be

00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:11.428
wearing other protective

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:12.996
equipment or if there's they're

00:52:13.063 --> 00:52:14.898
handling the clean filtered

00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:16.733
they may have less protection

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:17.300
and it's be it can be very

00:52:17.367 --> 00:52:19.135
confusing and so we've what

00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:19.769
we've done is we've- we just

00:52:19.836 --> 00:52:21.238
ask people to call the hotline

00:52:21.304 --> 00:52:23.006
if they have a concern but we

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:23.540
know that's one concerns.

00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:25.208
That's out there- and I don't

00:52:25.275 --> 00:52:26.977
know if you want to speak to

00:52:27.043 --> 00:52:27.544
any of the other oversight

00:52:27.611 --> 00:52:32.849
concerned about how we- how we

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:36.753
just not modern the contractors

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:37.354
in the field just on a day to

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:40.891
day basis. Yeah in terms of

00:52:40.957 --> 00:52:43.260
addressing- safety issues on

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:44.995
the site the- there's a

00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:46.963
requirements in these are all

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.564
spelled out in the clean up

00:52:47.631 --> 00:52:50.834
plan where if- wind kicks up

00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:52.969
above a certain- number of

00:52:53.036 --> 00:52:54.971
miles per hour. We just check

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:56.907
the operation down we make

00:52:56.973 --> 00:52:58.842
certain the swells covered-

00:52:58.909 --> 00:53:01.044
during excavation activities

00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:03.013
during dignitaries- we make

00:53:03.079 --> 00:53:05.015
certain that the soil is kept

00:53:05.081 --> 00:53:08.919
moist wet so doesn't blow up-

00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:09.519
eight and to be able so they

00:53:09.586 --> 00:53:11.288
can inhale it- there are

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:13.156
monitors set those up when and

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:15.058
down wind to ensure. That you

00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:17.193
know we know how fast the wind

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.129
is going- and also were

00:53:19.195 --> 00:53:21.197
monitoring to see if any of

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:22.999
that wind tech sector- within

00:53:23.066 --> 00:53:25.402
the area. The those are some of

00:53:25.468 --> 00:53:27.370
the kind of issues at least

00:53:27.437 --> 00:53:28.972
that I've heard that a

00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:31.241
percolated up- have you been

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:33.209
have you heard of anything in

00:53:33.276 --> 00:53:34.978
particular that we haven't

00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:38.882
mentioned. We could speak to.

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:41.217
I'm I think it's in a moderate

00:53:41.284 --> 00:53:41.818
there's definitely are people

00:53:41.885 --> 00:53:44.955
in the proper gear employees-

00:53:45.021 --> 00:53:47.057
save. Are we making sure that

00:53:47.123 --> 00:53:48.992
the third isn't playing around.

00:53:49.059 --> 00:53:49.559
It's also the question of

00:53:49.626 --> 00:53:51.194
whether and whether or not

00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:51.795
there's full disclosure when

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:53.496
there might be a section where

00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:55.231
they can't fully clean up the

00:53:55.298 --> 00:53:57.100
soil and why is that. On and

00:53:57.167 --> 00:53:59.002
then the finding out later so

00:53:59.069 --> 00:53:59.536
it's there's a lot of here

00:53:59.603 --> 00:54:01.404
behind what's the purpose of

00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:03.039
all this clean up and- when

00:54:03.106 --> 00:54:03.673
residents are being alerted to.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.175
To these pockets that might

00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:07.143
could be impossible to get to

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:09.079
what that means. The hearing

00:54:09.145 --> 00:54:09.713
about that at the end and so.

00:54:09.779 --> 00:54:11.414
Those are also concerns for

00:54:11.481 --> 00:54:15.151
community members tied to the

00:54:15.218 --> 00:54:15.752
par since work in particular.

00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:17.320
Yes for both Parsons as as any

00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:19.456
see. And this is because it's a

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:21.291
requirement across the entire

00:54:21.358 --> 00:54:23.360
project. There's a map. That

00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:26.997
is- basically created for each

00:54:27.063 --> 00:54:28.932
particular a parcel. And they

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:33.236
will mark. Where there is oil

00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:33.803
that is to say higher than

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.138
eighteen inches below. Ground

00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:37.273
service. And they will know.

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:39.209
The depth to which excavation

00:54:39.275 --> 00:54:41.277
occurred. So the- and that is

00:54:41.344 --> 00:54:43.380
you know that is provided to

00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:45.048
the residents of that if they

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:45.649
if they want to know exactly

00:54:45.715 --> 00:54:49.085
where- excavation occurred did

00:54:49.152 --> 00:54:49.719
not occur they have that as a-

00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:52.922
as a- written document. But but

00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:55.325
when I hear you're asking is I

00:54:55.392 --> 00:54:57.027
that is that being communicated

00:54:57.093 --> 00:54:59.195
in real time as the clean curry

00:54:59.262 --> 00:55:01.031
so we'll look at that I

00:55:01.097 --> 00:55:01.531
honestly don't know the

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:03.767
feedback loop on that and I

00:55:03.833 --> 00:55:04.367
think that's something that we

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:09.172
should. Expect a thirty two.

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:09.806
Not just to finish off on that

00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:11.841
spot. It's been felt by

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:12.876
community members that they're

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:13.476
finding out. At the end when

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:15.278
they're being told to sign up

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:17.113
the final thing off. And so

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:17.747
then they feel like well what

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:19.449
else he hiding from me or you

00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:21.384
know and so. There might be a

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:23.887
logical explanation but in real

00:55:23.953 --> 00:55:25.488
time it's not happening into

00:55:25.555 --> 00:55:26.956
there's a lot of anxiety about

00:55:27.023 --> 00:55:27.590
the work but after has. I know

00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:29.292
it's been left behind that's

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:31.528
very helpful to hear thank you.

00:55:31.594 --> 00:55:33.229
For this is that I have to many

00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:35.131
questions again Mister chair

00:55:35.198 --> 00:55:35.732
you can tell me if the second

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:39.202
was appropriate after the first

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:41.504
of. Soap my first question is

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:43.506
so if we had committed to the

00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:45.108
to our neighborhoods and our

00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:47.277
residents. A some percentage

00:55:47.343 --> 00:55:51.147
cleaning up we've it costs a

00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:51.748
little bit more the beginning

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:53.416
that means it subsequently less

00:55:53.483 --> 00:55:55.118
homes to be cleaned up and now

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.986
we're going to scale up. Or

00:55:57.053 --> 00:55:59.222
speed is a word used. In more

00:55:59.289 --> 00:56:01.091
efficient in the next phase.

00:56:01.157 --> 00:56:01.725
Where does that leave us in

00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:03.093
terms of percentage of work

00:56:03.159 --> 00:56:05.061
that was actually committed as

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:05.695
a been some analysis as if we

00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:07.597
were still I know it's not a

00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:08.198
hundred let's say if it was a

00:56:08.264 --> 00:56:11.267
hundred is I guess eighty five

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:11.735
I mean what what's the

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:12.335
percentage. We have some idea

00:56:12.402 --> 00:56:13.703
or can we get to the that full

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:15.271
commitment. So it's pretty

00:56:15.338 --> 00:56:17.307
clean up a sixteen under

00:56:17.373 --> 00:56:19.309
properties at sixteen hundred

00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:21.177
and six properties. And we've

00:56:21.244 --> 00:56:21.678
got- roughly ninety four

00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:23.379
million dollars- to clean up

00:56:23.446 --> 00:56:25.515
the remaining properties. We

00:56:25.582 --> 00:56:27.484
know that that is not going to

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:29.586
get us to the full thirty two

00:56:29.652 --> 00:56:33.356
hundred that we wanted to clean

00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:35.125
up to. The question now for us

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:37.393
at least is going forward for

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:39.295
under a better. Unit price

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:45.068
contract structure with Parsons.

00:56:45.135 --> 00:56:45.635
How how much will that drive

00:56:45.702 --> 00:56:47.203
down the price and we don't

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:49.639
have a good handle on that

00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:50.206
because we're not yet under

00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:51.608
contract we think it's going to

00:56:51.674 --> 00:56:53.209
substantially- with Parsons

00:56:53.276 --> 00:56:55.445
could substantially drive down

00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:57.213
the price so for example on

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.215
average persons around eighty

00:56:59.282 --> 00:56:59.749
three thousand dollars per

00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:03.486
parcel. We would like to get a

00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:05.255
you know price contract. That

00:57:05.321 --> 00:57:07.390
drops that down closer to

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:11.227
around 700-007-1000 somewhere

00:57:11.294 --> 00:57:13.396
around there- were not yet.

00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:14.030
Nobody has signed on the dotted

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:15.498
line so we don't know that

00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:17.000
that's going to be possible

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:19.135
that would be a pretty dramatic.

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:21.304
Reduction in the cost per

00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:21.938
parcel that they clean up. And

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:23.573
then each part of the clean up

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.073
in those reductions are

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:25.542
realized. More properties can

00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:27.577
be cleaned up under that

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:28.077
contract that would have

00:57:28.144 --> 00:57:31.381
otherwise been. Back in at this

00:57:31.447 --> 00:57:35.084
point timer we fully scaled up

00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:37.220
to expectations so the- so it

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:39.489
ebbs and flows across the year

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:41.357
because we're coming out of

00:57:41.424 --> 00:57:43.226
both winner as well as

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:45.395
holidays- this is traditionally

00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:47.397
the slowest time. For being

00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:49.432
able to ramp up but we're going

00:57:49.499 --> 00:57:51.434
into the spring. And so this is

00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:53.303
the point at which we do want

00:57:53.369 --> 00:57:55.171
to see people beginning to

00:57:55.238 --> 00:57:57.507
about. Their operations. We're

00:57:57.574 --> 00:57:59.509
currently- at thirty three

00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:03.413
crews- but both- NEC is most

00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:05.582
Parsons want to ramp up to more

00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:09.252
than that. The sugar. In order

00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:13.323
for a- this will as you might

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:15.091
talk about the non persecution-

00:58:15.158 --> 00:58:17.360
agreement and what I mean so

00:58:17.427 --> 00:58:17.927
people understand what that

00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:19.329
means in. One what aye

00:58:19.395 --> 00:58:23.199
remembers member the deep DTS.

00:58:23.266 --> 00:58:25.602
US attorney's office had deemed

00:58:25.668 --> 00:58:29.505
that. Excited would avoid

00:58:29.572 --> 00:58:30.073
criminal prosecution if they

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:33.343
did certain things- part of

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:35.245
that with this plan and now the

00:58:35.311 --> 00:58:37.447
date. Of DTS he's rejected the

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:38.014
plan that excite means what

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:39.649
that really actually means so

00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:41.351
we have a grasp on it I think

00:58:41.417 --> 00:58:43.319
you put your finger on it again

00:58:43.386 --> 00:58:45.488
home. Director cope can speak

00:58:45.555 --> 00:58:47.457
to this more in more detail

00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:49.525
but- they signed up an

00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:51.661
agreement in the settlement to

00:58:51.728 --> 00:58:53.429
do certain things and that

00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:55.265
included a thorough

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:57.433
investigation and- corrective

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.502
measures studies they haven't

00:58:59.569 --> 00:59:00.069
done those things and so we

00:59:00.136 --> 00:59:01.638
have asked the department of

00:59:01.704 --> 00:59:03.439
justice to wave than on

00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:05.208
prosecution. And to the chair

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:05.842
and what does that really mean

00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:07.443
if they continued could they

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:09.679
win a case could they lose the

00:59:09.746 --> 00:59:13.449
case what happens. Could date

00:59:13.516 --> 00:59:15.251
when the case or lose a case.

00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:15.852
If the you attorney gonna grow

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:19.489
are to remove to remove that

00:59:19.555 --> 00:59:21.457
agreement. Yes they if they

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:23.259
withdraw the non prosecution

00:59:23.326 --> 00:59:23.760
agreement basically non

00:59:23.826 --> 00:59:25.695
prosecution agreement was built

00:59:25.762 --> 00:59:27.563
on top of DTS these orders it

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.832
says comply with the tias he's

00:59:29.899 --> 00:59:31.234
orders. After doing just said.

00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:33.736
I tried is clearly failed to do

00:59:33.803 --> 00:59:35.338
that we told them they have

00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:35.972
failed to do that we have also

00:59:36.039 --> 00:59:39.475
asked- the department justice

00:59:39.542 --> 00:59:41.210
to withdraw the non prosecution

00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:41.778
agreement once they do that

00:59:41.844 --> 00:59:43.513
they can then. Well at whatever

00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:45.648
stage they were in terms of

00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:46.215
investigating the criminal

00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:47.917
conduct that side. They could

00:59:47.984 --> 00:59:51.354
pick that up right away. And if

00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:52.021
let's say they were a week away

00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:55.258
from filing- against excite.

00:59:55.325 --> 00:59:57.293
They would be a week closer to

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.362
actually doing it today. That's

00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:01.331
why we think it's important.

01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:03.499
Given that once we are somewhat.

01:00:03.566 --> 01:00:05.435
But we're a little bit

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:06.069
circumscribed what we can do

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:09.205
under the order because we got

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:09.739
to go through this dispute

01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:11.407
resolution process we've added

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:13.509
the order was the- state

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:15.211
Attorney General it complies

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:15.645
with all due process

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:17.580
requirements. But that's- it

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:19.582
just takes longer for us get to

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:21.684
a point where can actually do

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:23.553
truth Forsman. With the US DOJ.

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:25.388
If they were drawn on

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:27.523
prosecution agreement. They can

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.726
move right for them to. But

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.694
what is the do part for the

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:33.229
different pieces designs

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.698
proceed with prosecution. Good

01:00:35.765 --> 01:00:39.402
for on behalf of DOJ.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:39.969
Prosecutor for violating the

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.838
orders in the agreements for

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:43.639
non compliance will so that

01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:47.343
that's possible they didn't

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:47.844
when they signed the non

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.479
prosecution agreement- we don't

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:51.481
know the full totality of what

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:53.383
they were investigating- and

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:55.318
it's really up to them to bring

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:57.453
those charges that means the OJ

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.422
right. They were made. The

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.824
prosecution when the agreement

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:03.659
was signed. And so not remember

01:01:03.726 --> 01:01:07.430
me yeah. Yeah but it it would

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:08.031
be picking that back when that

01:01:08.097 --> 01:01:11.534
happens. Obviously there's the

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:12.035
potential for criminal

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:13.703
prosecution but certainly civil

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:17.573
a prosecution would allow for.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.609
A potentially right a for more

01:01:19.675 --> 01:01:21.944
funds to clean up the eighty

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:23.413
eighty community I would so I

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:25.481
would suspect. Not to mention

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:29.619
reimburse expenses. So it's

01:01:29.685 --> 01:01:31.487
really up to DOJ how they

01:01:31.554 --> 01:01:33.523
structure but it could- it has

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:34.090
certainly restructured non

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:35.625
prosecution agreements with

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:37.560
other entities that they've

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:39.395
entered into with waiting out

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:41.397
of five. The agreement to

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:42.031
require additional actions in

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:43.900
this case it would be up to DOJ

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:45.802
but surely could say. We will

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:49.605
only let you go this far if you

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:51.507
contribute action out of money.

01:01:51.574 --> 01:01:53.476
And then it's negotiation

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:57.513
between those two entities.

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:01.517
Thank you. Our if the- non

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:03.386
prosecution agreement were to

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:05.555
be dropped are there risks

01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:09.625
inherent in that to the TSA or

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:13.362
the state. The only see upside.

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:15.498
There were only upside we

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.567
didn't fact fact requested so

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:19.769
we think there's definitely

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:23.639
absent okay I. If ugh ugh you

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:27.477
could refer back to us like

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:28.077
twelve I have some questions

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:31.614
about the a to try and to. Just

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:33.716
rolled out a little bit and for

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:37.386
the system were better informed.

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:40.356
Of ten thousand one hundred and

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:41.691
fifty eight parcels that are

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:43.926
identified in the one point

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:49.966
seven miles all of. Area eighty

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:53.603
roughly five eleven ample. Is

01:02:53.669 --> 01:02:59.642
the full extent of Sam. I think

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:03.446
that comes under the act. Right

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:05.515
if we get access to other-

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:07.750
other parcels we can continue

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:09.986
sampling so officers under

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:12.054
under it- parcels if I at

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:14.190
eighty five fifty five and

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:17.693
sixteen hundred. That and tell

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.729
on fifty. The close. Your cool

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:23.566
but it only does matter of. We

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.801
have a nasty to her so we don't

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:27.904
rely on a her for doing the

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:29.805
copies but- it would be useful

01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:33.743
to know- what the you know what

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:34.310
what is represented by the

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:35.778
difference okay and how that

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:37.446
breaks down do you have none

01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:38.047
the Silicon night. Okay we'll

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:41.717
get that to you. I and can I

01:03:41.784 --> 01:03:44.020
just say one one thing about

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:45.955
that for those sixteen hundred

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:47.623
personals and the average. We

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:49.559
don't write anybody off until

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:51.594
we've gone through of really

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.963
exhaustive process. Of trying

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:54.597
to get in touch with them and

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:55.865
even then we still are open to

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:57.833
suggestions as to how to get a

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.869
little property members

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:01.637
property- owners and we're

01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:03.606
talking about seven. Attempted

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.841
engagement in some cases and

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:07.443
that includes certified letters

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.545
and things like that. Just want

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:10.179
to point that out. And assembly

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:13.616
member Garcia if I subtract.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.585
One thousand six of six and

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:17.687
sixteen hundred from eight

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:19.655
thousand five hundred and fifty

01:04:19.722 --> 01:04:27.797
five. What. The. Eighty five

01:04:27.863 --> 01:04:28.431
five five. That's all five okay

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:31.901
I've moved I'm- public thank

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:33.836
you for thank you for the

01:04:33.903 --> 01:04:37.840
detail of- but but- what what

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:39.609
I'm what I'm getting at now is.

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:43.779
A we've sampled. Eighty five

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:44.347
eight thousand five hundred

01:04:44.413 --> 01:04:47.717
fifty five parcels- cleaned

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:48.284
thousand center and six and

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:49.785
then there's another Cristina

01:04:49.852 --> 01:04:51.921
we don't have access to. I

01:04:51.988 --> 01:04:55.825
backing up estimate will by

01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:57.627
housing how far off of my- a

01:04:57.693 --> 01:05:01.831
little bit. So the so there's

01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:03.566
around five thousand parcels

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:05.935
remaining- to be cleaned is

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:09.805
that right. What and how much

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:13.643
time we spent on the initial

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:16.012
phases. Of we started cleaning

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:19.849
when. Sir I just want to add in

01:05:19.915 --> 01:05:24.353
one other factor not all the

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:24.987
properties are above eighty. So

01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:27.623
there's some certain percentage

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.859
that are lesson. And I don't

01:05:29.925 --> 01:05:30.426
have those numbers right off

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:31.627
the top of my head but I'll

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:32.194
I'll get them to you so what

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:35.731
I'm getting at- by going

01:05:35.798 --> 01:05:36.432
through this exercise is trying

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:39.568
to get an understanding of.

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:41.671
Even with the efficiencies that

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:43.706
we're talking about here what's

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.841
the timeline look like going

01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:53.883
forward. It's there's a couple

01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:54.550
different ways to answer that I

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.018
don't want to insult the wrong

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:59.689
way so. In terms of. Keeping

01:05:59.755 --> 01:06:01.891
our intent is just to maintain

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:03.726
the pace of work and as as as-

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:06.028
we mentioned the idea would be

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:08.097
to ramp up now that spring is

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:09.899
coming in to get more even more

01:06:09.965 --> 01:06:10.533
than one hundred property stone

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.068
a month. So that's that's our

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:13.703
goal and you can just. We'll

01:06:13.769 --> 01:06:17.707
just keep going until on we

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:18.374
don't have funds and then we'll

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:19.875
look for the other funds will

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:21.877
assume you have fun we have I'm

01:06:21.944 --> 01:06:23.679
just from- from the first time

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:25.781
you have fun- what how much

01:06:25.848 --> 01:06:27.717
work is left to be done. Zoom

01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:29.819
to match the presumed workload.

01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:31.754
What is the time frame. Of

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:34.023
let's suck- additional. Let

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:35.958
let's let's imagine at the

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:39.929
current pace. Is the future

01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:44.133
place. Hundred fifty I'm trying

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.001
to give the folks here a sense

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:49.805
of. Where we are in time with

01:06:49.872 --> 01:06:51.741
this project because I think

01:06:51.807 --> 01:06:52.375
we're talking more than three

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:55.578
years. Three for four years.

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:56.178
Can not these are not numbers

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:58.214
that I think anybody should

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.049
hold you to it might take

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:02.051
longer right but hopefully your

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:04.053
wedding on strategies. To

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.688
actually reduce that time which

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:07.823
I think that's commendable and

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:11.927
a good idea- but yet. Another

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:13.796
three years or so certainly in

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.965
in the- communication with

01:07:16.031 --> 01:07:19.702
members of- of the local

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:21.804
community who were affected-

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.906
you've identified a lot of

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:25.741
different. Means of

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:26.375
communication which I think is

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:27.943
great- but you haven't

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:31.781
mentioned texting which- to me

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:32.448
is one of the most obvious ways

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:34.250
of he met back folks out there

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:36.185
would you appreciate the

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:37.787
ability. To communicate back

01:07:37.853 --> 01:07:39.989
and forth by taxed. But I know

01:07:40.055 --> 01:07:42.091
I know you that much more than

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:44.059
email today- and I don't think

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.961
I'm exceptional in that so if

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:47.997
you could consider adding that

01:07:48.063 --> 01:07:50.065
to the ways. In which you

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:52.101
communicate it might actually

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:55.871
be more efficient. Of and then

01:07:55.938 --> 01:07:58.107
with respect to the- remaining

01:07:58.174 --> 01:08:00.176
funds there's about ninety

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:03.879
million dollars left- in a best

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:06.015
case scenario. How much further

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:10.019
second take us. So it it

01:08:10.085 --> 01:08:12.254
depends on a lot of different

01:08:12.321 --> 01:08:14.256
factors- most notably depends

01:08:14.323 --> 01:08:16.258
on whether we can get into you

01:08:16.325 --> 01:08:21.797
know price contract. If you

01:08:21.864 --> 01:08:22.364
take a house going to be my

01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:26.168
next question. You know we have

01:08:26.235 --> 01:08:28.070
two different contractors and

01:08:28.137 --> 01:08:29.805
that's good because we want

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:31.707
each one to be able to ramp up-

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:33.876
to the number of cruise if they

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:35.811
can sustain- so that we can

01:08:35.878 --> 01:08:36.378
clean up more properties

01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:43.986
concurrently. You know roughly

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:46.021
if you take a look at the

01:08:46.088 --> 01:08:47.790
ninety four million dollars

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:52.094
that remains. I think we can

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:54.096
get close to about twenty seven

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:58.100
hundred they're about. So about

01:08:58.167 --> 01:08:59.969
half give or take a of the

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:02.004
remaining parcels and then

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:02.505
they'll be a need for

01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:05.808
supplemental appropriation

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:07.910
yeah. Thank you for that. Are

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.079
there any other questions other

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:12.014
questions this Garcia. Yes

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:17.987
thank you. We have phase one of

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:20.155
was a goal of thirty two

01:09:20.222 --> 01:09:20.756
hundred until at the rate at

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.057
which we're going we're not

01:09:22.124 --> 01:09:22.725
going to have enough money from

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:24.026
the Appropriations we have

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:26.028
right now for face one we have

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:28.097
face to homes that are above.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:30.232
Eighty and below four hundred

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:31.800
which is still a really high

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:33.802
level that need to be cleaned

01:09:33.869 --> 01:09:35.938
up and so we have many home fix

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:36.572
that occurs a behind no one's

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:38.073
going to be left behind-

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.042
anything there's a lot of

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.810
confusion and the community

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:44.246
about. What that means for now

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:44.880
face one and even face to our

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:46.115
face the whatever the

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:48.017
additional basis we have here.

01:09:48.083 --> 01:09:50.185
And while the- well we've

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:51.887
appropriate at this money. We

01:09:51.954 --> 01:09:54.456
do have the potential for more

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:56.392
money seventy coming in through

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:58.160
two different bill for the

01:09:58.227 --> 01:10:00.062
community has worked on the

01:10:00.129 --> 01:10:02.064
battery fee fund us so that we

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:04.333
can see a future. I to make

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.970
sure that we were not leaving

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:08.571
homes behind can you speak to

01:10:08.637 --> 01:10:09.905
that a little bit. Yeah so we

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:14.076
are looking and- at those bills

01:10:14.143 --> 01:10:14.677
and what they mean in terms of

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:17.980
us. Prioritizing different

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.149
cleanups and- because that is a

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:23.953
statewide. Initiative however.

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:24.553
We recognize that this is an

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:26.522
ongoing clean up and first of

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:30.225
all as- as we talked about any

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:32.127
interruptions to the work

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:33.996
that's going on here will only

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.898
end up being more costly. And

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:36.465
so whatever we can do to

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:38.167
maintain the work and

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:41.904
continuity of the work and use

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:42.538
available funds were ever those

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:44.173
funds com the better off we're

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:45.908
going to be and so we're very

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:47.910
motivated to make sure the

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:50.012
other funds or- any other funds

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:51.914
that we- have a have a have

01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:52.514
available to us can get used

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:56.085
honest. To again keep the crews

01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:56.685
in the field keep the momentum

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:58.387
going and so what as we look at

01:10:58.454 --> 01:11:00.289
the dollars that we do have we

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:00.789
talked about the Parsons

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:02.324
contract but we haven't talked

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:04.193
about the NEC contract and-

01:11:04.259 --> 01:11:06.328
less I remember seeing that it

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:08.130
was a substantially lower cost

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:10.232
per household. Without contract

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:12.101
and to do can you speak to. Why

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:14.370
we have the disparities and if

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:16.138
there is separate to try to

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.140
expand the NEC contractor. Is

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:18.741
just trying to figure out the

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:22.778
discrepancy here and get the

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:24.046
most bang for our Buck. Yeah

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:24.613
over the life of the their

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.348
participation in the project in

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:28.217
the sea is rich in about sixty

01:11:28.283 --> 01:11:28.751
eight thousand dollars per

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.419
parcel so substantially lower

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:30.953
than the eighty three for

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:34.089
persons we're in the midst of

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:36.091
finalizing an amendment and

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:36.725
then the number seven. To any

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:38.093
seize contract that will

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.928
provide additional partials-

01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:42.197
because were we haven't yet

01:11:42.264 --> 01:11:42.865
issued it we can't really speak

01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:44.500
to the particulars in it that's

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:46.235
fine to say. That will contain

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:48.137
hundreds of properties- that we

01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:50.205
believe- needs to be put into

01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:54.109
place. Because they're just-

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:54.710
they cost less and do a really

01:11:54.777 --> 01:11:58.247
good job. A cleaning up

01:11:58.313 --> 01:12:01.950
partials relative to Parsons-

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:04.319
we still think it's good to

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:06.055
stick with to contractors

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:06.722
because once again we can have

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:08.590
more crews in the field. But in

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:10.526
terms of any see where we were

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:12.628
right on the cusp of reaching

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:14.196
them a new amendment. So once

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:14.797
we issue that and will become

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:16.365
public but it's going to

01:12:16.432 --> 01:12:19.968
contain hundreds of properties.

01:12:20.035 --> 01:12:20.602
So we're very motivated to give

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:22.337
them as much work as we can.

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:40.322
Quite simply. The news cycle a

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:42.624
single you know access question

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:46.028
every time we me with PTSD what

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:46.628
is it that we could do outside

01:12:46.695 --> 01:12:48.564
of a- finances that we could do

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.365
because- if there are. Problems

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:54.103
with- contracting that prevent

01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:54.770
you from sole sourcing and it's

01:12:54.837 --> 01:12:56.538
not my prog who does the work

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:58.540
it's my proud of that. That

01:12:58.607 --> 01:13:00.142
it's done in a quick as to and-

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:02.277
highest quality. Are there

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:04.413
impediments that need to be

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.281
changed legislatively that

01:13:06.348 --> 01:13:08.183
would. Allow offer a quick

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.219
quicker faster more efficient

01:13:10.285 --> 01:13:18.127
clean up. Yeah at this point-

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:20.496
just referencing back to one of

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:22.331
my earlier statements. Of this

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:26.034
being a large complex project-

01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:28.203
having contractors understand.

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:28.637
The difficulties of

01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:32.374
implementing it we want to get

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:32.975
them wrapped up as quickly as

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:36.245
possible and that's really the

01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:38.213
most important thing. There are

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.048
other cost reduction measures

01:13:40.115 --> 01:13:42.117
and we work with your staff and

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:44.186
other staff for- other-

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:46.155
legislators with local

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:46.655
governments to try and

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:48.490
streamlined reduce permitting

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:50.159
costs for example- we're

01:13:50.225 --> 01:13:52.461
talking about ways in which we

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:54.163
can work with a local

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.797
governments to do our reach to

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:56.331
some of the either sixteen

01:13:56.398 --> 01:13:58.267
hundred properties are people

01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:00.235
who are. Really responsive. I

01:14:00.302 --> 01:14:02.304
think holding hearings like

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:04.106
this that- are publicized in

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:04.740
the get the word out to people

01:14:04.807 --> 01:14:06.341
who might not. It's amazing but

01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:08.210
it's true that they might not

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.379
know about okay that that

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:11.013
letter that I got release they

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:12.281
should call that number- it's

01:14:12.347 --> 01:14:14.349
really the accumulation of all

01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:16.385
these actions within these

01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:18.253
communities that helps us- make

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:18.854
certain we gotta properties to

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:24.159
clean up. And I really don't

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:24.827
think that the that legislative

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:26.528
statutory. Impediments are

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:28.597
really getting our progress on

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:30.499
the on the project and for all.

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:32.267
I think we've learned a lot

01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:34.336
more much more efficient. As it

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:36.638
is we'll continue to work on

01:14:36.705 --> 01:14:40.309
that but right now I don't

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:42.244
think that's where our focus.

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:46.148
Well Greta- I want to thank

discussion we're having and

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:40.862
what he's saying that because I

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:41.463
want people to kind of bills

information and- obviously it's

a Friday evening there's a lot

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:49.071
happening in the county of Los

01:16:49.137 --> 01:16:52.341
Angeles and I do want to make

01:16:52.407 --> 01:16:54.576
clear that- our director for

01:16:54.643 --> 01:16:56.511

01:17:02.584 --> 01:17:04.586
How can I say challenge that's

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:06.521
facing the county if not- the

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:08.690
entire. Continent and that is

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:10.726
has to do with this- virus a

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:12.728
corona virus so we're dealing

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:14.629
with that right now and have

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:16.365
been this morning but we're

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:19.001
here today and I'm I will again

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:19.634
want to thank you for your time

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:20.736
and effort. Assembly member

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:22.637
bloom for providing this

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:24.706
opportunity to hear from the

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:26.508
community I know. That's first

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:28.744
and foremost what this is about

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:30.345
really to hear from the

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:32.681
constituents and I wanna give a

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:36.284
shout out to well. Colorado

01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:38.387
who's the before he leaves. And

01:17:38.453 --> 01:17:40.789
also to all the stakeholders in

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:42.591
the community residents in the

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:44.292
people that have been impacted

01:17:44.359 --> 01:17:46.561
for the so many years of that

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:48.296
this is been an ongoing-

01:17:48.363 --> 01:17:52.601
challenge for us here in in-

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:53.268
the one point seven mile radius

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:54.536
but if not. Perhaps even

01:17:54.603 --> 01:17:58.306
farther than that more than the

01:17:58.373 --> 01:17:58.907
ten thousand households that

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:00.609
have been impacted I think

01:18:00.675 --> 01:18:02.477
there has been a lot of

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:04.780
progress made I kind of one of

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:06.548
begin on that no because I have

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:08.450
seen- the difference in terms.

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:10.485
At least attention being paid.

01:18:10.552 --> 01:18:12.721
In just a brief discussion that

01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:15.057
I had was father- John read

01:18:15.123 --> 01:18:16.525
earlier he tells me that

01:18:16.591 --> 01:18:17.159
there's been a series of other

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:19.194
meetings. Just this week. With

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:22.631
a kißm de and DTS see staff

01:18:22.697 --> 01:18:23.265
that have been here. And that

01:18:23.331 --> 01:18:26.401
that gives me some sense that

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:26.935
people are finally really

01:18:27.002 --> 01:18:30.539
taking this- very seriously and

01:18:30.605 --> 01:18:32.707
at a level that we have not

01:18:32.774 --> 01:18:34.643
seen before- and I think it has

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:36.678
to do a lot with their

01:18:36.745 --> 01:18:38.613
constituents in the residents

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.515
making their voices heard. But

01:18:40.582 --> 01:18:41.149
also along with the leadership

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.717
now in the state. In the

01:18:42.784 --> 01:18:44.753
assembly- three year leadership

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.788
and yet this committee staff in

01:18:46.855 --> 01:18:47.389
the members that are. Seated

01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:50.759
here and also- I would say- are

01:18:50.826 --> 01:18:52.661
governor both governor's

01:18:52.727 --> 01:18:54.496
previous governor Jerry Brown

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:55.097
who initially gave us some

01:18:55.163 --> 01:18:58.600
funding- to start this- knowing

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.569
full well that that was just

01:19:00.635 --> 01:19:02.537
the first step. And I think

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:04.439
with this- new governor Gavin

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:06.741
Newsom these- in a unique.

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:08.777
Position I think to help us out

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:11.213
even more and I've seen it

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:12.547
demonstrated already through.

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:14.616
The passage of legislation that

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:18.653
Dahle. Name address are simply

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:19.254
woman care. I know that to a

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:20.622
lot of lifting on the part of

01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:22.657
the community and people here

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:24.593
in the room- and trying to

01:19:24.659 --> 01:19:26.394
figure out how those those

01:19:26.461 --> 01:19:27.028
funds are going to come to this

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:28.597
community knowing that that

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:30.599
legislation. Impacts the entire

01:19:30.665 --> 01:19:32.634
state but certainly this is one

01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:34.803
of those areas we hope that.

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.471
Those funds could be- utilized

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:38.406
quickly so that whatever

01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:40.509
mechanisms and formulas that

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:42.410
are set up that we look at-

01:19:42.477 --> 01:19:44.513
income in low income areas that

01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:46.448
are in distress right now and

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.416
if the pace that. Of we just

01:19:48.483 --> 01:19:50.485
learned- that it will take to

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:52.554
clean up to get to the other

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:53.188
six thousand or so households

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:54.556
it's going to take some time.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:56.691
So I know I understand that

01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:58.593
we're going to need a lot a lot

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:00.795
more help here. I understood

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:04.399
initially that we were the TSC.

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:04.933
In two thousand eight was

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.535
targeting households of at

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:08.703
least two thousand five

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:09.271
hundred. And I just heard I

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:10.872
think here that there that was

01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:16.578
now of up. To three thousand.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:17.112
Three thousand thirty five

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:17.679
hundred which is which is

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:20.649
great- but I know our goal is

01:20:20.715 --> 01:20:22.884
to really. Attempt to reach

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:24.986
more households- I'm happy that

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:26.588
the governor's budget included

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.690
the seventy four. Of point five

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:30.592
million this year and that was

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:32.427
we want to thank the governor

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:33.028
for that. Well that's money

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:36.665
that I believe- can help us- in

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:38.900
a small way to understand and

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:39.501
hopefully get more teams out

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:42.404
work crews out. On on the field

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.971
and in the ground to help

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:44.739
provide the cleanup but I'm

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:46.908
very excited about AB one forty

01:20:46.975 --> 01:20:48.810
two because I know that that

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:50.412
money. Is going to provide

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:52.714
relief over time for many many

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:54.716
years to come so I we want to

01:20:54.783 --> 01:20:56.685
work with the DTS see. And with

01:20:56.751 --> 01:20:59.087
our partners to see how we can

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:02.657
try to expedite that- I am a

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:03.258
little bit concerned about the

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:06.895
fact it of. Fees regarding

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:08.496
other regulatory agencies as

01:21:08.563 --> 01:21:10.532
appeared in the presentation

01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:11.132
may have some impact perhaps

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:12.968
there's a way that we can work

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:16.638
with those agencies also. To

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:18.607
understand. The difference in

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:20.575
the magnitude. Of the problem

01:21:20.642 --> 01:21:21.209
that we're facing here. And to

01:21:21.276 --> 01:21:23.144
work with us I know that there

01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:24.846
been other remedies in other

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:26.648
parts of the state. And perhaps

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.583
that can also be something in

01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:30.518
terms of legislative.

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:32.420
Initiative to bring forward

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:34.422
that concern to those agencies

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:37.192
it also receives state funding.

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:37.792
And perhaps there may be some

01:21:37.859 --> 01:21:38.927
mechanism for they can also

01:21:38.994 --> 01:21:40.795
provide relief- the deal with

01:21:40.862 --> 01:21:42.897
heavy trucks for example a

01:21:42.964 --> 01:21:44.966
ki&lt;c.cyan&gt; de. Of things of that&lt;/c&gt;

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:47.035
nature- just in terms of fees

01:21:47.102 --> 01:21:50.839
that are administered. Perhaps

01:21:50.905 --> 01:21:51.406
there's a some waivers or

01:21:51.473 --> 01:21:52.674
something that could be looked

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.809
at- one thing that I do wanna

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:56.845
addresses that. The sixteen

01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:58.847
hundred- households where we've

01:21:58.913 --> 01:22:00.915
not been able I think the TSC

01:22:00.982 --> 01:22:02.651
have been able to contact the

01:22:02.717 --> 01:22:04.786
land. Landlords appropriately I

01:22:04.853 --> 01:22:07.889
think our county we may be in a

01:22:07.956 --> 01:22:08.523
position to try to help.

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.859
Identify who those property

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:14.529
owners. Bar treasurer tax

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:15.130
collector. And perhaps that's

01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:17.232
something that we can work on I

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:18.667
think I mentioned that earlier

01:22:18.733 --> 01:22:22.637
to. To Meredith. At a meeting I

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:24.706
had with yesterday- in other

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:26.541
words counties ready ready and

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:27.108
willing to work and I think

01:22:27.175 --> 01:22:28.710
we've demonstrated that. I'm

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:30.645
very I'm very pleased that-

01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:33.114
initially we put in our own two

01:22:33.181 --> 01:22:33.748
million dollars just to do our

01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:34.949
own testing. And to come back

01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:36.718
and to share that with the

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:40.755
previous- DTS see director in

01:22:40.822 --> 01:22:41.323
terms of how this could be

01:22:41.389 --> 01:22:42.757
quickly expedited. And I really

01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:45.160
want to give kudos to Dr barber

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:46.995
for were. Ferrer who was in

01:22:47.062 --> 01:22:50.699
here but our staff is. Very AB

01:22:50.765 --> 01:22:52.934
able to describe- with that has

01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:54.936
entailed and I do wanna let the

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:56.771
community know and I think many

01:22:56.838 --> 01:22:58.740
of them. Present here know that

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:00.909
we really took this very

01:23:00.975 --> 01:23:02.777
serious. At the county of Los

01:23:02.844 --> 01:23:05.046
Angeles where it we actually

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:06.948
had our stay. Only tear and-

01:23:07.015 --> 01:23:10.852
from Munich about in actually

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:13.054
help a survey. Five and homes.

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:14.889
Under to that cost we did. Our

01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:20.729
and we're still. To out and

01:23:20.795 --> 01:23:23.031
with that also. Prepared to put.

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:24.799
More on the tester. Today we

01:23:24.866 --> 01:23:26.768
have the outside is providing

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:27.402
that would be doing the- since

01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:27.969
we started. And that's also

01:23:28.036 --> 01:23:28.970
Acosta spinning by the county

01:23:29.037 --> 01:23:30.939
were we're glad to provide that

01:23:31.005 --> 01:23:32.741
we know we have to do more

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:34.776
because you're still. Many

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:35.276
residents that are very

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:37.312
reluctant to come forward they

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:39.047
don't actually. At all times

01:23:39.114 --> 01:23:42.784
understand what that means. But

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:43.385
we try think in fact to get

01:23:43.451 --> 01:23:45.120
back to them as soon as

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:46.888
possible there are. Some of

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:49.090
alarms they go off so that they

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:51.192
know what actions to take and

01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:52.894
how we can help remedy that.

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:54.796
And we do have clinics

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.664
available here one that was

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:57.298
just opened about two years ago

01:23:57.365 --> 01:24:00.769
and son son all east LA. Clinic

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:02.871
that's available just to do

01:24:02.937 --> 01:24:03.505
testing and I think. The your

01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:05.140
your committee some of the

01:24:05.206 --> 01:24:06.641
members went out when you were

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:09.244
last here. So I wanna I wanna

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:10.879
you know just remind you of

01:24:10.945 --> 01:24:13.081
that. I think a in terms of

01:24:13.148 --> 01:24:15.150
what. We're trying to do is

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:18.887
really- we've together other

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:19.487
sources of funding that we

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:21.022
have. We were able to secure

01:24:21.089 --> 01:24:25.226
funding- through Dealey so can

01:24:25.293 --> 01:24:26.828
you canyon settlement. Of five

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:28.863
million dollars and we were

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:30.899
able to set aside. To help us

01:24:30.965 --> 01:24:33.001
for cleanup so we set up a

01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:35.103
special- how can I say a

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:37.338
process to be able to use and

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:38.640
drawn up money to help is here

01:24:38.706 --> 01:24:40.875
with excite. So we've been

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:42.744
pulling monies aside in any way

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:44.879
that we can. In addition- to

01:24:44.946 --> 01:24:48.883
our- lead based paint hazardous

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:50.752
remediation program we've also.

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.887
A look to providing of and how

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:54.923
can I say partnership with the

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:56.958
TNC to start looking at how we

01:24:57.025 --> 01:24:58.860
can overlay the same households

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:02.831
or- at least not or duplicate

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:03.431
but try to reach a far greater

01:25:03.498 --> 01:25:05.133
number. Of households to begin

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.202
that cleanup so we appreciate

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:09.037
the funding that. That we

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:10.939
received from the state- and

01:25:11.005 --> 01:25:13.208
through all of. Department of

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:14.876
housing and urban development

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:15.443
where they awarded as three

01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:17.178
point four million dollars but

01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:19.314
keep in mind that isn't just

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.015
for the exciting packed it

01:25:21.082 --> 01:25:23.318
area. So we have to negotiate

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:26.855
as you know with other- board

01:25:26.921 --> 01:25:28.823
members so we are we are

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:29.357
dealing with that but our

01:25:29.424 --> 01:25:31.259
highest priority has always

01:25:31.326 --> 01:25:33.094
been areas where have. They

01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:34.929
have been heavily contaminated

01:25:34.996 --> 01:25:35.530
so we're going to continue to

01:25:35.597 --> 01:25:37.265
do that so in addition to that

01:25:37.332 --> 01:25:40.902
were also again looking at a

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:41.569
settlement that we had with the

01:25:41.636 --> 01:25:44.772
California Attorney General. LA

01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:45.340
county and the city of LA a

01:25:45.406 --> 01:25:46.875
hundred and twenty million

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:49.043
dollars settlement- with regard

01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:51.045
to Porter Porter ranch. So that

01:25:51.112 --> 01:25:53.081
will also I believe assistance

01:25:53.147 --> 01:25:55.049
in some manner and again- this

01:25:55.116 --> 01:25:56.885
is not been an easy. Process

01:25:56.951 --> 01:25:59.153
for us because other entities

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:01.122
local governments don't think

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:03.458
that the county should have

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:04.993
been given. Us some of that

01:26:05.059 --> 01:26:07.061
settlement but we argued I

01:26:07.128 --> 01:26:08.830
think pretty effectively and

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:09.497
that matter and that's where we

01:26:09.564 --> 01:26:11.065
can also use help so that our

01:26:11.132 --> 01:26:13.167
state partners understand that

01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:16.771
were also using new- measures-

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:19.040
to try to extract in and

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:19.641
receive funding here what we

01:26:19.707 --> 01:26:21.142
believe. Funding can be

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:23.278
utilized in a manner that still

01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:26.881
conforms with cleanup so Lisa

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:30.785
canyon yes very important. I

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:33.087
very important how can we of.

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:33.755
That additional funding do more

01:26:33.821 --> 01:26:34.923
and work together with the

01:26:34.989 --> 01:26:37.191
state and with our other local

01:26:37.258 --> 01:26:38.960
entities to see that that. That

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:42.864
that happens- I wanted to just

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:43.398
tell you that I know our

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:45.199
constituents as to has been

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:47.068
articulated by the assembly.

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:51.105
Individuals seems to. Ring ring

01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:53.141
true and that people are still

01:26:53.207 --> 01:26:55.076
very concerned about why is it

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:57.178
taking so long. To get their

01:26:57.245 --> 01:26:59.113
homes cleaned up. And one of

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:01.282
the things that- we've learned

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:03.418
also is it once people do have

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:05.253
their homes clean. How are they

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.890
made aware that the clean up is

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:11.159
actually- verified- and if

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:13.561
someone is coming back right

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:15.296
and I know that maybe the

01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:16.864
protocols aren't set in place

01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:19.000
for that. But perhaps there can

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:20.868
be made some assurances

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:21.469
whatever that measurement is

01:27:21.536 --> 01:27:24.872
the people fully understand

01:27:24.939 --> 01:27:27.041
that in layman's terms. So I

01:27:27.108 --> 01:27:27.675
really do believe communication

01:27:27.742 --> 01:27:29.377
I think is going to be a theme

01:27:29.444 --> 01:27:30.878
you're going to keep hearing

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:33.081
about. Because while things are

01:27:33.147 --> 01:27:34.983
happening on the ground with

01:27:35.049 --> 01:27:35.550
the cruise a clean up it's

01:27:35.617 --> 01:27:37.185
always about the communication

01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:39.220
and the cultural competency.

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:40.888
And the cultural competency

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:43.124
comes through in terms of the

01:27:43.191 --> 01:27:45.193
contracting. The people that

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:47.195
are on the ground and your

01:27:47.261 --> 01:27:49.297
staff fifty TSC but more

01:27:49.364 --> 01:27:51.232
importantly I also think that

01:27:51.299 --> 01:27:53.034
it's important for us to think

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:55.136
about how we can. Probably help

01:27:55.203 --> 01:27:56.871
to bridge this miscommunication

01:27:56.938 --> 01:27:59.240
by having another set of eyes

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:01.009
and I know that you have groups

01:28:01.075 --> 01:28:01.609
now that you're contracting

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:05.079
with the east side yards. But I

01:28:05.146 --> 01:28:06.881
would like to suggested perhaps

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:09.017
there's a way that other groups

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:11.119
community groups are already

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:11.653
doing this kind of work.

01:28:11.719 --> 01:28:13.321
Reaching out to the same people

01:28:13.388 --> 01:28:15.390
whether it even be on census

01:28:15.456 --> 01:28:17.358
for example people are knocking

01:28:17.425 --> 01:28:19.360
on doors for different things

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:21.162
now. Perhaps carrying

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:23.197
information along with that

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:26.901
effort about what people might

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:27.535
know or not know about what's

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:29.237
happening with that side. And

01:28:29.303 --> 01:28:31.406
what that means so if there's a

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:33.107
way that we can try to

01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:35.076
collaborate or create some form

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.011
of funding that can be made

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:39.280
available to those- third party

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:41.149
groups but our vested here and

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:41.582
have the credit the

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:45.019
credentials. The credibility I

01:28:45.086 --> 01:28:45.586
think that that could be

01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:47.288
something that should be looked

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:49.090
at and whether you pull that

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:51.159
from DTS see or from-

01:28:51.225 --> 01:28:55.096
department of. Health could

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:57.131
probably be a way of maybe-

01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:59.434
bringing that together I know

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:03.071
we've been able to couple for

01:29:03.137 --> 01:29:03.604
funding. Streams together

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:05.306
through a pull health. To do.

01:29:05.373 --> 01:29:05.907
That very same our so I don't

01:29:05.973 --> 01:29:07.275
see why the state couldn't

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:09.077
explore. Some new avenues to

01:29:09.143 --> 01:29:11.479
try to try to bring on more-

01:29:11.546 --> 01:29:13.047
more staff that are capable of

01:29:13.114 --> 01:29:17.151
doing that- I would just say

01:29:17.218 --> 01:29:19.320
the other thing is. I think I

01:29:19.387 --> 01:29:20.988
think we ought to really

01:29:21.055 --> 01:29:23.157
explore what- what is happened

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:25.326
with respect to- excite not

01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:27.161
being in compliance. With the

01:29:27.228 --> 01:29:30.998
TSC and DOJ- I know our county

01:29:31.065 --> 01:29:31.499
council we've had those

01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:35.069
discussions. And were more than

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:37.205
happy to work. Alongside with

01:29:37.271 --> 01:29:39.240
you. The TSC in the state to

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:41.008
see how we can leverage that.

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:43.444
So we can try to get more for

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:45.279
our residents here because I

01:29:45.346 --> 01:29:47.315
believe me in my opinion

01:29:47.381 --> 01:29:49.250
personally speaking. As a

01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:51.219
collected official I would have

01:29:51.285 --> 01:29:53.254
never settle for. For this

01:29:53.321 --> 01:29:55.323
agreement additionally and I

01:29:55.389 --> 01:29:57.492
think that I think that's

01:29:57.558 --> 01:29:59.193
really important- just to say

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:03.264
with that. We have some very

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:05.233
able able and capable people

01:30:05.299 --> 01:30:07.468
here- will speak in more detail

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:09.137
about some of the questions

01:30:09.203 --> 01:30:11.372
with- the particulars of what

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:13.241
we've been doing but I do want

01:30:13.307 --> 01:30:15.176
to keep keep you are fully

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:15.676
aware that. You know we

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:19.147
represent- East Los Angeles

01:30:19.213 --> 01:30:19.747
mostly heavily impacted here

01:30:19.814 --> 01:30:21.616
but the other cities that have

01:30:21.682 --> 01:30:25.019
been impacted bill commerce-

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:27.188
burn in. A may would. This del

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:29.423
all all of them deserve to have

01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:33.227
the same level of the-

01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:33.861
treatment in terms of getting

01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:35.563
information out there are no a

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:37.165
series of meetings have been

01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:39.367
help. Make you need to happen

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:41.269
with the cities but I do think

01:30:41.335 --> 01:30:43.471
that. A crew has to be made

01:30:43.538 --> 01:30:45.540
available that will be able to

01:30:45.606 --> 01:30:47.441
articulate. With the various

01:30:47.508 --> 01:30:49.377
cities also in explaining

01:30:49.443 --> 01:30:51.379
because we often get calls. Of

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:53.281
from some of our local

01:30:53.347 --> 01:30:55.249
residents that we represent in

01:30:55.316 --> 01:30:55.817
those areas as well that

01:30:55.883 --> 01:30:57.451
sometimes the information is

01:30:57.518 --> 01:30:59.453
not. Is not given in an

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.122
appropriate consistent

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:03.257
consistent manner and I would

01:31:03.324 --> 01:31:03.825
ask that more meetings be

01:31:03.891 --> 01:31:07.128
health. Of a on a smaller scale

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:07.695
so that smaller cities and

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.430
groups can come together and

01:31:09.497 --> 01:31:10.031
understand and they're looking

01:31:10.097 --> 01:31:13.367
at. Apples to apples and- that

01:31:13.434 --> 01:31:15.636
that it that- that we get some

01:31:15.703 --> 01:31:17.338
feedback about how that is

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:19.440
being conducted- and just

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:21.342
lastly I'm happy that. I'm

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:23.644
happy that we have a new

01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:25.346
director at the TSC- but I am

01:31:25.413 --> 01:31:27.515
too concerned about the two

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:29.550
contracts. Of more importantly

01:31:29.617 --> 01:31:31.485
with Parsons in anything

01:31:31.552 --> 01:31:33.354
because I think there can be

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:35.356
some. Cost savings in terms of

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:37.625
contracting and- trying to

01:31:37.692 --> 01:31:41.128
lower lower any administrative-

01:31:41.195 --> 01:31:43.464
or other costs- and looking at

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:43.931
how we can open up

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:45.366
opportunities perhaps with

01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:47.468
other contractors. And really

01:31:47.535 --> 01:31:51.138
see in- you know the best the

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:53.608
quality but also looking ahead

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:54.208
in terms of workforce because

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:55.643
right now we have competing

01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:57.411
interests in terms of who is

01:31:57.478 --> 01:31:59.280
capable of clean up. And many

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:01.115
of those individuals are

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:01.582
working on some of our

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:03.384
construction projects as we

01:32:03.451 --> 01:32:05.286
speak now. In terms of

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:07.288
retrofitting housing that we

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:07.922
need because we have an urgency

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:09.557
with homelessness. So we're

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:11.459
pulling from the same pool so

01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:13.527
we need to grow the pool so I

01:32:13.594 --> 01:32:17.265
would ask that. The state also

01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:17.865
look at using some of those

01:32:17.932 --> 01:32:19.500
workforce training dollars that

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:21.235
you have that the governor's

01:32:21.302 --> 01:32:23.371
put in his budget. To set aside

01:32:23.437 --> 01:32:27.308
in can- for projects like this

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:29.243
where where we find a shortage

01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:29.744
of individuals that are

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:31.345
available in perhaps as a pipe

01:32:31.412 --> 01:32:33.547
effort maybe look at. Of places

01:32:33.614 --> 01:32:35.516
that have been- impacted

01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:37.551
because of health and other

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:39.553
issues that are I know are of

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.822
great concern to our governor.

01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:45.493
So with that- I would just

01:32:45.559 --> 01:32:47.261
leave leave you with that and

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:47.862
thank you for the opportunity

01:32:47.929 --> 01:32:49.864
to be here and to thank the

01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:51.465
residents. And everybody that

01:32:51.532 --> 01:32:55.303
has been working so hard- the

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:57.538
fight goes on. Is what I would

01:32:57.605 --> 01:32:59.674
say. In the fight because on

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:01.575
and we have to. Keep our eye on

01:33:01.642 --> 01:33:03.311
goal. Thank and because about

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:05.279
it so with that I wanted to do

01:33:05.346 --> 01:33:05.913
so doctor still be opening at

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.415

01:33:11.619 --> 01:33:13.254

southeast LA and the exite.

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:17.391
Impacted area would turn it

01:33:17.458 --> 01:33:19.327
over to her and her staff.

01:33:19.393 --> 01:33:19.927

expressed a lot of comments-

01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:35.543
concerns and ideas I think

01:33:35.609 --> 01:33:37.611
they're all. Of consideration

01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:39.380
and- looking forward to the-

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:43.351

01:34:01.969 --> 01:34:03.571
important issue as it directly

01:34:03.637 --> 01:34:05.406
impacts the health and well

01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:07.241

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:09.243
Angeles county residents face.

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:11.545
A continuing risk of exposure

01:34:11.612 --> 01:34:13.814

01:34:31.432 --> 01:34:33.501
contaminated communities

01:34:33.567 --> 01:34:35.236
impacted by Exide technologies.

01:34:35.302 --> 01:34:39.507
Battery recycling in Vernon. I

01:34:39.573 --> 01:34:41.409

Sunland the supervisor mention.

01:35:17.445 --> 01:35:19.814
We are also expanding the

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.649
capacity of the local health

01:35:21.715 --> 01:35:23.617
care providers to screen young

01:35:23.684 --> 01:35:25.352
children for developmental

01:35:25.419 --> 01:35:28.055
delays and to connect. The

01:35:28.122 --> 01:35:29.623
affected families to needed

01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:31.392
services at their local schools.

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:35.663
In just a in- to say something

01:35:35.729 --> 01:35:37.832
in Spanish KT yeah I mean this

01:35:37.898 --> 01:35:39.633
and then landed us yes us but

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.769
we soda force who needed asco

01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:43.971
in a stable that phone those

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:45.806
pada. A misty Gatling get level

01:35:45.873 --> 01:35:47.741
meaning that point I mean now

01:35:47.808 --> 01:35:51.745
the board. Four nine three

01:35:51.812 --> 01:35:52.346
seven eight technology. Yelled

01:35:52.413 --> 01:35:54.181
at hero and now have to. Turn

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:56.217
it over to Dr Rangan. Of the

01:35:56.283 --> 01:35:59.453
medical texts. Toxicologist

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.087
with environmental health by LA

01:36:00.154 --> 01:36:05.793
county. Thank you very much-

01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:07.695
Dodge creative- I wanted ext

01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:10.264
also extend my thanks to the

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:10.831
assembly members for putting

01:36:10.898 --> 01:36:12.032
this together and helping to

01:36:12.099 --> 01:36:13.567
sort of shepherd this whole

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:15.603
thing through the state all in

01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:16.170
all of the work the really

01:36:16.237 --> 01:36:17.638
gives us the starting point say

01:36:17.705 --> 01:36:19.540
where we can do. Our work and

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:21.709
also to supervisors Lisa you in

01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:22.376
the members of your office that

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:23.844
really- keep health as the

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:25.880
front of the line issue and

01:36:25.946 --> 01:36:29.817
despite all the- work that all

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:30.384
of our elected officials are

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:31.719
doing on the regulatory

01:36:31.785 --> 01:36:33.554
frontier in the contracting in

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:34.088
the finance and the legal

01:36:34.155 --> 01:36:37.591
issues- we are all here for one

01:36:37.658 --> 01:36:38.159
primary reason. And that's

01:36:38.225 --> 01:36:39.727
that's our health and

01:36:39.793 --> 01:36:41.795
everything else is supporting

01:36:41.862 --> 01:36:45.666
the port of that- and- new- Mr

01:36:45.733 --> 01:36:47.601
Garcia made a an important

01:36:47.668 --> 01:36:49.603
point about you know trying to

01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:50.171
see how we can all put our

01:36:50.237 --> 01:36:51.472
heads together about doing

01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:53.541
things faster- because this is

01:36:53.607 --> 01:36:54.208
not just an important issue in

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:55.709
public health isn't urgent

01:36:55.776 --> 01:36:57.611
issue in public health and is

01:36:57.678 --> 01:36:59.580
the urgency. For me that- you

01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:01.815
really sort of resonates about

01:37:01.882 --> 01:37:03.684
this whole situation we need to

01:37:03.751 --> 01:37:05.653
always continually look for

01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:07.721
ways and sit back broadly and

01:37:07.788 --> 01:37:09.757
put our heads together to try

01:37:09.823 --> 01:37:10.324
to figure out how can we do

01:37:10.391 --> 01:37:12.026
this faster and I know there's

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:13.827
probably ways that we haven't

01:37:13.894 --> 01:37:15.696
thought of yet. And we need to

01:37:15.763 --> 01:37:17.698
continue to do that- all that

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:19.934
being said- I think what's

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.468
important result in a in a lot

01:37:21.535 --> 01:37:22.036
of what I'm saying I've said

01:37:22.102 --> 01:37:23.537
before it many public meetings

01:37:23.604 --> 01:37:24.138
I think it's always good to

01:37:24.205 --> 01:37:25.806
remind ourselves about the

01:37:25.873 --> 01:37:28.008
importance of this health issue

01:37:28.075 --> 01:37:29.810
here. We learned a lot in the

01:37:29.877 --> 01:37:30.377
past twenty or thirty years

01:37:30.444 --> 01:37:33.581
about how human health is very

01:37:33.647 --> 01:37:35.816
tied to our to our environments

01:37:35.883 --> 01:37:37.685
and we always knew that but now

01:37:37.751 --> 01:37:38.285
we know a lot more about it-

01:37:38.352 --> 01:37:39.954
than we ever did and when you

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:41.956
look at the contamination that

01:37:42.022 --> 01:37:43.924
excite has rained down on this

01:37:43.991 --> 01:37:45.726
community not just for the past

01:37:45.793 --> 01:37:47.628
ten years twenty years thirty

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:50.965
years but for the past. Eighty

01:37:51.031 --> 01:37:51.565
to ninety years- and we have-

01:37:51.632 --> 01:37:53.601
so much contamination that has-

01:37:53.667 --> 01:37:55.669
impacted this. Just bear but

01:37:55.736 --> 01:37:57.938
also on the ground as a result

01:37:58.005 --> 01:37:59.974
of that it's just an atrocious

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:05.479
situation when it comes to can

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:06.146
unity contaminate. It and then.

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:08.115
How for decades I'm sure every

01:38:08.182 --> 01:38:09.650
knows this room Exide operated

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:11.485
without a permit and because

01:38:11.552 --> 01:38:13.654
they were operating without a

01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:14.221
permit we have a significant

01:38:14.288 --> 01:38:15.990
lack of data all the emissions

01:38:16.056 --> 01:38:17.958
that may have been occurring

01:38:18.025 --> 01:38:19.693
over the past many decades and

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.895
so we don't have- the ability

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:23.697
to truly estimate. The impacts

01:38:23.764 --> 01:38:26.100
of all of those chemicals over

01:38:26.166 --> 01:38:28.035
all those years over all of

01:38:28.102 --> 01:38:29.837
your lives and that's very

01:38:29.903 --> 01:38:32.806
unfortunate so what that puts

01:38:32.873 --> 01:38:33.440
us the position that puts us in

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:34.008
in the health department is

01:38:34.074 --> 01:38:35.776
that we have to take what we

01:38:35.843 --> 01:38:37.645
know now and try to provide

01:38:37.711 --> 01:38:39.747
services and resources for you

01:38:39.813 --> 01:38:41.715
moving forward in order to make

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:42.283
sure that your health is

01:38:42.349 --> 01:38:43.817
maintained and you can live as

01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:45.686
healthy lives as possible- when

01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:49.590
it comes to. Lead contamination

01:38:49.657 --> 01:38:50.157
in particular which is what

01:38:50.224 --> 01:38:51.859
we're talking about today there

01:38:51.925 --> 01:38:53.961
are multiple sources of lead in

01:38:54.028 --> 01:38:55.796
our environment we've known

01:38:55.863 --> 01:38:56.430
this for a very long time even

01:38:56.497 --> 01:38:58.165
in this bottle if you look hard

01:38:58.232 --> 01:38:58.799
enough there's a little bit of

01:38:58.866 --> 01:39:00.034
light in there we know that we

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:01.969
are exposed to lead in small

01:39:02.036 --> 01:39:03.671
amounts from many different

01:39:03.737 --> 01:39:05.939
sources- one of the primary

01:39:06.006 --> 01:39:07.708
sources as many of us are where

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:09.610
are is lead paint that is in

01:39:09.677 --> 01:39:10.244
many homes. But when it comes

01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:11.979
to community like like this

01:39:12.046 --> 01:39:13.914
that communities that live near

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:16.016
the exite facility you now have

01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:19.887
this extra layer of unique and

01:39:19.953 --> 01:39:21.789
obviously unnecessary

01:39:21.855 --> 01:39:23.924
contamination and it's right in

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:26.293
your front yards in your

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.594
backyard so if you're homes.

01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:29.730
And that is a very very unique

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:31.832
kind of potential exposure to

01:39:31.899 --> 01:39:33.867
lead that you have that the

01:39:33.934 --> 01:39:37.604
other folks in the rest of Los

01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:38.205
Angeles county don't have as

01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:40.240
supervisors Lee said we have

01:39:40.307 --> 01:39:41.775
our our our- our our truck

01:39:41.842 --> 01:39:43.744
outside where you can get free

01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:45.612
let testing. We do that around

01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:46.213
these communities there's one

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:48.215
other area where we do that as

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:49.683
well that's the communities

01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:51.719
around Gwinnett co big surprise

01:39:51.785 --> 01:39:52.386
right and we don't really have

01:39:52.453 --> 01:39:54.154
that service in most of the

01:39:54.221 --> 01:39:55.856
rest of Los Angeles county

01:39:55.923 --> 01:39:56.490
because they don't need it as

01:39:56.557 --> 01:39:58.125
much as he's communities need

01:39:58.192 --> 01:39:59.827
it. And you're gonna need that

01:39:59.893 --> 01:40:01.762
service for the foreseeable

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:03.864
future and until all this

01:40:03.931 --> 01:40:05.699
contamination has been taken

01:40:05.766 --> 01:40:09.803
care of until all the homes are.

01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:10.437
Seen that Sir is going to have

01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:11.705
to be there and that's what I

01:40:11.772 --> 01:40:12.239
want to come of you know

01:40:12.306 --> 01:40:14.074
highlights is as the goal I

01:40:14.141 --> 01:40:14.708
want to eliminate that service.

01:40:14.775 --> 01:40:15.843
I want to get to the point

01:40:15.909 --> 01:40:16.443
where we don't have to have

01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:18.045
that service anymore. And once

01:40:18.112 --> 01:40:19.813
we get to the point where all

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:20.414
the homes are clean we're one

01:40:20.481 --> 01:40:24.151
step closer to that. So when it

01:40:24.218 --> 01:40:24.685
comes to exposure to lead

01:40:24.752 --> 01:40:25.919
exposure to lead can cause a

01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:27.721
number of different problems.

01:40:27.788 --> 01:40:29.790
But there are some twists and

01:40:29.857 --> 01:40:30.457
turns about that but I want to

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:32.226
kind of talk to you about. We

01:40:32.292 --> 01:40:33.727
know that led can affect

01:40:33.794 --> 01:40:34.328
multiple body systems we know

01:40:34.395 --> 01:40:35.829
it can affect your kidneys we

01:40:35.896 --> 01:40:37.765
know can affect your liver we

01:40:37.831 --> 01:40:39.800
know can affect your brain. And

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:40.467
a number of other organs in our

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:43.771
body- but you the way that led

01:40:43.837 --> 01:40:45.706
works. It's a little bit like.

01:40:45.773 --> 01:40:46.173
Like having high blood

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.008
pressure. Here's what I mean by

01:40:48.075 --> 01:40:50.043
that. If you look at a person

01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:52.146
who has high blood pressure you

01:40:52.212 --> 01:40:52.746
can't look at them and just

01:40:52.813 --> 01:40:54.081
kind of know. That person has

01:40:54.148 --> 01:40:56.150
high blood pressure. High blood

01:40:56.216 --> 01:40:57.785
pressure is one of those will

01:40:57.851 --> 01:40:59.820
be called silent diseases where

01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:00.454
people can have it for a long

01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:02.222
time and longer you have it the

01:41:02.289 --> 01:41:04.191
longer you have it. The more it

01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:05.726
affects your body and then

01:41:05.793 --> 01:41:07.728
later on you start to have-

01:41:07.795 --> 01:41:09.730
real issues heart disease.

01:41:09.797 --> 01:41:11.799
Stroke a risk all kinds of

01:41:11.865 --> 01:41:12.466
problems like that. Latest kind

01:41:12.533 --> 01:41:14.268
of the same way you can have

01:41:14.334 --> 01:41:16.136
letting your body and the more

01:41:16.203 --> 01:41:18.005
that you have a risk of being

01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:20.974
exposed to it and the more let

01:41:21.041 --> 01:41:21.542
that builds up in your body

01:41:21.608 --> 01:41:24.745
over time. He can be very very

01:41:24.812 --> 01:41:25.712
silent and then as soon as you

01:41:25.779 --> 01:41:27.981
get to a point. Enough lead in

01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:28.649
your body. A lot of bad things.

01:41:28.715 --> 01:41:31.752
But and those bad things and-

01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:33.754
they're very hard to reverse.

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:35.856
So that's why we want to make

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:36.423
sure that whenever we are

01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:38.125
dealing with lead exposure for

01:41:38.192 --> 01:41:39.893
lead poisoning. The most

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.962
important thing about that is

01:41:42.029 --> 01:41:43.831
preventing it to begin with

01:41:43.897 --> 01:41:44.498
because once it already happens

01:41:44.565 --> 01:41:47.801
it's very hard to- put the

01:41:47.868 --> 01:41:48.402
toothpaste back in the tube

01:41:48.469 --> 01:41:50.170
right that's the sort of the

01:41:50.237 --> 01:41:51.805
way that we look at it. So

01:41:51.872 --> 01:41:52.372
prevention is what it's all

01:41:52.439 --> 01:41:53.941
about and the way that we can

01:41:54.007 --> 01:41:54.608
prevent more lead poisoning is

01:41:54.675 --> 01:41:56.143
by clean these are is to

01:41:56.210 --> 01:41:57.845
prevent that exposure. When

01:41:57.911 --> 01:41:59.847
children go outside and play.

01:41:59.913 --> 01:42:02.749
Yeah whether we like it or not

01:42:02.816 --> 01:42:03.917
children eat about one to two

01:42:03.984 --> 01:42:05.886
tablespoons of dirt on a per

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:06.420
day when they're playing

01:42:06.487 --> 01:42:07.955
outside. As a as a your plane

01:42:08.021 --> 01:42:08.455
looking their hands in

01:42:08.522 --> 01:42:10.224
accumulated that it's about one

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:12.092
to two tables and that's what

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:14.194
the estimate is. And the

01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:14.761
children in the playoffs. If

01:42:14.828 --> 01:42:15.829
they're there should be a

01:42:15.896 --> 01:42:17.831
reason why children can't play.

01:42:17.898 --> 01:42:18.465
Outside in your front yard in

01:42:18.532 --> 01:42:20.167
the backyard and your neighbors

01:42:20.234 --> 01:42:22.035
yards. And so to have a

01:42:22.102 --> 01:42:23.937
situation like this where. You

01:42:24.004 --> 01:42:26.139
now basically can't live a

01:42:26.206 --> 01:42:28.041
normal life. Right have your

01:42:28.108 --> 01:42:30.077
children play outside- that's a

01:42:30.143 --> 01:42:31.745
big deal to us and so clean

01:42:31.812 --> 01:42:33.847
these homes is not just about-

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:34.481
the strictly the health issue

01:42:34.548 --> 01:42:36.216
of lead poisoning but it's

01:42:36.283 --> 01:42:37.851
about your general likelihood.

01:42:37.918 --> 01:42:38.452
And that's why it's important

01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:40.120
issue to us of the public

01:42:40.187 --> 01:42:41.788
health department. So the

01:42:41.855 --> 01:42:44.057
response the seizure of course

01:42:44.124 --> 01:42:44.691
requires very pollution cleanup

01:42:44.758 --> 01:42:46.226
of all these properties. And

01:42:46.293 --> 01:42:48.095
the allocation of funding

01:42:48.161 --> 01:42:48.762
necessary in order to make that

01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:50.230
happen. Now young children and

01:42:50.297 --> 01:42:52.132
families were exposed to

01:42:52.199 --> 01:42:54.101
hazardous chemicals over long

01:42:54.167 --> 01:42:54.701
periods of time whether it's

01:42:54.768 --> 01:42:56.303
that. Or something else brings

01:42:56.370 --> 01:42:58.238
up a lot of issues in terms of

01:42:58.305 --> 01:42:59.940
the services that we as a

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:00.574
public health department. Need

01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:02.175
to make sure that you have

01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:04.344
available. And so want to talk

01:43:04.411 --> 01:43:04.978
a little bit about some of the

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:06.013
services that we're making

01:43:06.079 --> 01:43:06.613
available have made available

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:07.948
to the community and we're

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:09.917
still working on as well. The

01:43:09.983 --> 01:43:10.584
first is to make sure that we

01:43:10.651 --> 01:43:12.286
insure. That there is good

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:15.956
enough- access to information

01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:17.858
and into services. As the

01:43:17.925 --> 01:43:18.458
supervisor said we've got you

01:43:18.525 --> 01:43:20.160
know a few- local- department

01:43:20.227 --> 01:43:21.828
of health services

01:43:21.895 --> 01:43:22.462
comprehensive health centers.

01:43:22.529 --> 01:43:24.498
That are in this area those are

01:43:24.565 --> 01:43:25.899
made available to residents to

01:43:25.966 --> 01:43:28.135
receive- free helps at this

01:43:28.201 --> 01:43:28.769
health services in general and

01:43:28.835 --> 01:43:30.370
also free let let screening.

01:43:30.437 --> 01:43:32.506
And then financial screening as

01:43:32.573 --> 01:43:33.907
well for your family to

01:43:33.974 --> 01:43:36.176
evaluate- where you can fit in

01:43:36.243 --> 01:43:36.810
with health insurance etcetera.

01:43:36.877 --> 01:43:38.512
And also this permanent- county

01:43:38.579 --> 01:43:40.147
resource center that was

01:43:40.213 --> 01:43:42.182
established to provide support.

01:43:42.249 --> 01:43:42.683
And information for the

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:44.084
community as well let let

01:43:44.151 --> 01:43:46.086
screening as was mentioned to.

01:43:46.153 --> 01:43:48.088
And other resources as well to-

01:43:48.155 --> 01:43:50.157
the residents around the exite

01:43:50.223 --> 01:43:52.125
facility- it's also important

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:53.961
to us to link the community

01:43:54.027 --> 01:43:54.461
residents to healthcare

01:43:54.528 --> 01:43:56.196
resources. Particular to that

01:43:56.263 --> 01:43:58.332
free blood led screen it's want

01:43:58.398 --> 01:44:00.200
to talk a little bit more about

01:44:00.267 --> 01:44:04.004
that as well. Since about- two

01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:04.638
thousand sixteen or so- we were

01:44:04.705 --> 01:44:06.239
offering but let's be a little

01:44:06.306 --> 01:44:08.075
bit before that but it really

01:44:08.141 --> 01:44:08.675
started to take shape around

01:44:08.742 --> 01:44:10.110
two thousand sixteen. Since

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:14.081
that time we three to six

01:44:14.147 --> 01:44:14.715
thousand residents so far who'd

01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:16.083
been had a blood lead tests-

01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:17.951
through those efforts.

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:20.287
Including four thousand. And

01:44:20.354 --> 01:44:24.157
that's just the F. that were

01:44:24.224 --> 01:44:26.193
talk about the three blocks

01:44:26.259 --> 01:44:28.195
screening. Dish to help

01:44:28.261 --> 01:44:30.297
provider who are. Doing let's

01:44:30.364 --> 01:44:34.201
screening is a- yeah are to. Is

01:44:34.267 --> 01:44:38.038
refer lots family as well the-

01:44:38.105 --> 01:44:42.109
to provide to. A may this test

01:44:42.175 --> 01:44:45.846
as well. That's we improve the

01:44:45.912 --> 01:44:54.454
Gen away. But I also wanted a

01:44:54.521 --> 01:44:56.189
highlight the- the community

01:44:56.256 --> 01:44:58.325
outreach that- that we've taken

01:44:58.392 --> 01:45:00.260
on as well. As supervisor said

01:45:00.327 --> 01:45:00.861
we've had a lot of different

01:45:00.927 --> 01:45:02.429
outreach campaigns that we've

01:45:02.496 --> 01:45:04.398
been engaged in since around

01:45:04.464 --> 01:45:05.966
two thousand fifteen. Around

01:45:06.033 --> 01:45:06.566
the time when the facility was

01:45:06.633 --> 01:45:08.301
closing- to inform residents

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:10.370
about contamination on their

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:12.105
properties. How to protect

01:45:12.172 --> 01:45:13.974
themselves in their home- about

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:15.876
the efforts that the state is

01:45:15.942 --> 01:45:16.443
undertaking as well and the

01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:18.211
importance of blood lead

01:45:18.278 --> 01:45:21.948
testing- and in addition member

01:45:22.015 --> 01:45:24.317
it this is. Not only about lead

01:45:24.384 --> 01:45:24.885
right there are some other

01:45:24.951 --> 01:45:25.952
chemicals had this facility-

01:45:26.019 --> 01:45:27.954
released into the environment

01:45:28.021 --> 01:45:28.588
as well. A number of different

01:45:28.655 --> 01:45:30.424
gases and all of these

01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:34.194
chemicals have raised your-

01:45:34.261 --> 01:45:34.728
risk of long term health

01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:36.463
effects so it's not. Only about

01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:38.398
let it's about other chemicals

01:45:38.465 --> 01:45:40.167
to and so we're- engage in

01:45:40.233 --> 01:45:42.369
efforts to educate you and also

01:45:42.436 --> 01:45:43.003
your healthcare providers about

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:44.271
all the things that could be

01:45:44.337 --> 01:45:45.972
occurring. As a result of those

01:45:46.039 --> 01:45:46.540
exposures. Supervisor also

01:45:46.606 --> 01:45:48.341
mention the survey- that we did

01:45:48.408 --> 01:45:50.043
in two thousand seventeen. And

01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:52.345
altogether after those outreach

01:45:52.412 --> 01:45:52.979
efforts in the survey efforts

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:54.448
and more door to door efforts

01:45:54.514 --> 01:45:56.249
we actually reach about sixteen

01:45:56.316 --> 01:45:56.817
thousand homes all together

01:45:56.883 --> 01:46:00.754
now- to- provide. Our region

01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:01.321
and link residents to the

01:46:01.388 --> 01:46:02.322
health services sat through

01:46:02.389 --> 01:46:04.424
resource tables etcetera we

01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:06.560
have a number community events

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:08.161
that we do at. A church in

01:46:08.228 --> 01:46:10.163
community centers YMCAs and

01:46:10.230 --> 01:46:10.797
number rather different places.

01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:12.332
And for more details on that we

01:46:12.399 --> 01:46:14.201
have our table outside and you

01:46:14.267 --> 01:46:14.835
can- go to them they'll be able

01:46:14.901 --> 01:46:16.536
to tell you- more places that

01:46:16.603 --> 01:46:18.438
you can- I'll go for not. Let

01:46:18.505 --> 01:46:20.540
testing but just to get the

01:46:20.607 --> 01:46:22.309
more resources and get that

01:46:22.375 --> 01:46:24.311
letter sometime today you want

01:46:24.377 --> 01:46:26.079
or you. Talk to our folks out

01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:26.680
there you can such but to it

01:46:26.747 --> 01:46:30.250
at. An early time and I think

01:46:30.317 --> 01:46:32.119
we have we've done all a

01:46:32.185 --> 01:46:34.087
hundred of those can. Outreach

01:46:34.154 --> 01:46:42.429
event we plan do a lot more.

01:46:42.496 --> 01:46:43.029
When I get back to hell care

01:46:43.096 --> 01:46:44.431
for. As well because it's not

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:46.299
only. Edge you about these but

01:46:46.366 --> 01:46:46.900
also your care. In this. So

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:48.335
that they aware about what to

01:46:48.401 --> 01:46:50.170
out for and- the- are as I said

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:52.139
because of the lack of. Data

01:46:52.205 --> 01:46:52.739
that we don't have over the

01:46:52.806 --> 01:46:54.741
last eighty ninety years about

01:46:54.808 --> 01:46:55.308
emissions that came from

01:46:55.375 --> 01:46:58.145
excite. It's hard to really put

01:46:58.211 --> 01:47:00.347
a number on the risks that

01:47:00.413 --> 01:47:00.981
people have we know that your

01:47:01.047 --> 01:47:02.449
risks of. Long term illnesses

01:47:02.516 --> 01:47:04.284
are elevated but knowing

01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:06.086
exactly how much is something

01:47:06.153 --> 01:47:06.686
we may never know the answer

01:47:06.753 --> 01:47:08.555
to. That's why it's important

01:47:08.622 --> 01:47:10.090
to make sure your healthcare

01:47:10.157 --> 01:47:10.690
providers are armed with the

01:47:10.757 --> 01:47:12.459
information to know. How should

01:47:12.526 --> 01:47:14.094
they be regarding U. S.

01:47:14.161 --> 01:47:14.594
patients what kinds of

01:47:14.661 --> 01:47:16.229
screenings are more important

01:47:16.296 --> 01:47:18.298
to do for you as you age. To

01:47:18.365 --> 01:47:20.133
make sure that we- catch

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:20.767
disease early in prevent them

01:47:20.834 --> 01:47:24.337
from happening if possible. So

01:47:24.404 --> 01:47:24.905
we have been connecting with

01:47:24.971 --> 01:47:26.573
the- with healthcare leaders so

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:30.310
all over the area. And met with

01:47:30.377 --> 01:47:36.082
about two hundred. Said that.

01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:38.385
In in the area but we it about

01:47:38.451 --> 01:47:40.453
proxy for. Miles of X. working.

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:42.522
To efforts to a- of. About X.

01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:44.491
in general. How the health care

01:47:44.558 --> 01:47:46.293
needs of the as red. And when

01:47:46.359 --> 01:47:46.960
receive a- treatment when they-

01:47:47.027 --> 01:47:48.428
obviously again to. Ever the

01:47:48.495 --> 01:47:50.597
need for- for lead. Led screen.

01:47:50.664 --> 01:47:52.632
And we develop materials for

01:47:52.699 --> 01:47:54.434
them and resources for them to

01:47:54.501 --> 01:47:54.935
call us when they have-

01:47:55.001 --> 01:47:58.071
questions to- again you know we

01:47:58.138 --> 01:47:58.672
do all this stuff because we

01:47:58.738 --> 01:48:00.674
know the necessity of the it

01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:02.442
especially for this. Particular

01:48:02.509 --> 01:48:04.544
community and the- the issues

01:48:04.611 --> 01:48:06.246
that you've gone through the

01:48:06.313 --> 01:48:06.880
experiences you that you've had

01:48:06.947 --> 01:48:08.515
as a result of this

01:48:08.582 --> 01:48:10.483
contamination. And again my

01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:11.117
vision is I want to get to a

01:48:11.184 --> 01:48:12.719
point where we do not have to

01:48:12.786 --> 01:48:14.521
have. That truck out there to

01:48:14.588 --> 01:48:16.456
screen people for let it's

01:48:16.523 --> 01:48:18.959
great that we have it's great

01:48:19.025 --> 01:48:20.093
to have that resource for. All

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.429
you. The bill seat. Stand your

01:48:22.495 --> 01:48:24.397
blood leads us. But would great

01:48:24.464 --> 01:48:26.633
if we to that point where we-

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:28.235
clean up all these your- and

01:48:28.301 --> 01:48:28.869
got rid of. All and would have

01:48:28.935 --> 01:48:30.337
need for that anymore that's-

01:48:30.403 --> 01:48:32.405
the world I want. To an- and

01:48:32.472 --> 01:48:34.641
getting the done as quick as-

01:48:34.708 --> 01:48:38.345
is the first so with that.

01:48:38.411 --> 01:48:40.447
Wanted now. To not allow of our

01:48:40.513 --> 01:48:42.682
head. Next Janet Scully. And

01:48:42.749 --> 01:48:44.517
she me talk a little bit about

01:48:44.584 --> 01:48:46.586
our account. Of and resources

01:48:46.653 --> 01:48:48.421
the we are at to. A number

01:48:48.488 --> 01:48:50.523
these different efforts so.

01:48:50.590 --> 01:49:02.369
Turned over to a T. Janet. And

01:49:02.435 --> 01:49:02.903
we're gonna but and wrap

01:49:02.969 --> 01:49:04.571
separate. To eight thirty and

01:49:04.638 --> 01:49:06.506
still want to have time the

01:49:06.573 --> 01:49:08.508
people who was like. Up to a-

01:49:08.575 --> 01:49:10.310
as a think we've got a half

01:49:10.377 --> 01:49:12.212
dozen or so. Rick just. So

01:49:12.279 --> 01:49:14.347
within that time I will put the

01:49:14.414 --> 01:49:16.216
red things up for public. So

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:18.351
it's a two about the exciting.

01:49:18.418 --> 01:49:20.420
The county used fund we see

01:49:20.487 --> 01:49:22.389
from the way. Say that. To

01:49:22.455 --> 01:49:24.357
educate. And learning to.

01:49:24.424 --> 01:49:24.991
Assessed for two. Live in the-

01:49:25.058 --> 01:49:26.459
impacted by. And so public

01:49:26.526 --> 01:49:28.395
health actually pie. A pro. To

01:49:28.461 --> 01:49:30.430
in. Development screening. And

01:49:30.497 --> 01:49:30.964
all families to. So that

01:49:31.031 --> 01:49:32.465
healthcare providers can I de.

01:49:32.532 --> 01:49:34.734
Per early. And initiate ness in

01:49:34.801 --> 01:49:38.438
other nest. Interventions and

01:49:38.505 --> 01:49:40.273
then I'm really excited to

01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:40.807
announce that the county

01:49:40.874 --> 01:49:42.542
receive funding to provide-

01:49:42.609 --> 01:49:46.579
lead paint hazard remediation.

01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:48.882
So and other home improve

01:49:48.949 --> 01:49:52.218
service to. Homes the exite

01:49:52.285 --> 01:49:54.220
area and as supervisor so least

01:49:54.287 --> 01:49:54.754
mentioned- I won't go into

01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:58.258
detail but we recieved. And two

01:49:58.325 --> 01:50:00.660
of sources of funding to do

01:50:00.727 --> 01:50:02.562
lead paint hazard remediation

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:04.664
in this community we've already

01:50:04.731 --> 01:50:06.533
begun the work it's going very

01:50:06.599 --> 01:50:10.303
well- we have a table outside

01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:12.405
and with folks who can give you

01:50:12.472 --> 01:50:13.006
more information or you can.

01:50:13.073 --> 01:50:16.676
Fill out an application and see

01:50:16.743 --> 01:50:18.445
if your your home qualifies. I

01:50:18.511 --> 01:50:20.513
also just wanted to mention

01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:21.047
that the county received

01:50:21.114 --> 01:50:24.351
approximately a hundred and

01:50:24.417 --> 01:50:26.419
thirty four million dollars as

01:50:26.486 --> 01:50:26.987
the result of a twenty year

01:50:27.053 --> 01:50:30.423
hard fought lawsuit with three

01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:32.325
paint companies. And this

01:50:32.392 --> 01:50:34.527
funding will allow us to launch

01:50:34.594 --> 01:50:36.529
an unprecedented and county

01:50:36.596 --> 01:50:38.465
wide program to provide lead

01:50:38.531 --> 01:50:40.633
paint hazard remediation

01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:42.369
services. And that's scheduled

01:50:42.435 --> 01:50:44.771
to start in April twenty twenty

01:50:44.838 --> 01:50:46.573
and that will also include the

01:50:46.639 --> 01:50:50.410
exciting area this program will

01:50:50.477 --> 01:50:52.312
consist of community outreach

01:50:52.379 --> 01:50:54.514
blood lead testing- lead paint

01:50:54.581 --> 01:50:54.981
hazard assessment and

01:50:55.048 --> 01:50:56.649
remediation this kind of work

01:50:56.716 --> 01:50:58.618
has never been done to this

01:50:58.685 --> 01:51:01.521
size or this go. Anywhere else

01:51:01.588 --> 01:51:02.589
in the country so with the

01:51:02.655 --> 01:51:04.491
trail Blazers for this work- so

01:51:04.557 --> 01:51:06.726
thank you for allowing us to

01:51:06.793 --> 01:51:10.397
speak- public health really

01:51:10.463 --> 01:51:10.964
enjoys working is in this

01:51:11.031 --> 01:51:12.766
community even given the

01:51:12.832 --> 01:51:14.401
circumstances we enjoyed

01:51:14.467 --> 01:51:16.703
meeting you we enjoy working

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:18.705
with you- we've had really

01:51:18.772 --> 01:51:20.540
great experiences here. And we

01:51:20.607 --> 01:51:24.310
hope to continue working really

01:51:24.377 --> 01:51:24.911
hard for this community- with

01:51:24.978 --> 01:51:26.813
that I wanted to let you know

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.581
we have a short video and it

01:51:28.648 --> 01:51:30.583
really describes the lead paint

01:51:30.650 --> 01:51:32.419
repair services that are now

01:51:32.485 --> 01:51:34.687
being offered- again these are

01:51:34.754 --> 01:51:36.790
free services no cost to you

01:51:36.856 --> 01:51:38.825
and we thought this is just a

01:51:38.892 --> 01:51:42.729
really nice- demonstration of

01:51:42.796 --> 01:51:46.466
what you can expect. I see a

01:51:46.533 --> 01:51:50.370
blank in the sky. Which in this.

01:51:50.437 --> 01:51:58.478
He won't. Nay or stop. Darkness

01:51:58.545 --> 01:52:02.615
or- have reached home and my

01:52:02.682 --> 01:52:04.384
some born couple my after we

01:52:04.451 --> 01:52:06.553
didn't know was a in anything

01:52:06.619 --> 01:52:08.721
like that but when I him to get

01:52:08.788 --> 01:52:10.824
tested that came out positive

01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:12.625
his finger and then when he

01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:14.527
went and got his blood work

01:52:14.594 --> 01:52:17.297
completely that and I told me

01:52:17.363 --> 01:52:17.864
it was it was like a half an

01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:20.600
I've I was a cover I have

01:52:20.667 --> 01:52:22.769
someone relief because a it's

01:52:22.836 --> 01:52:24.671
carried know your has some in

01:52:24.737 --> 01:52:36.916
your aware it. Either also came

01:52:36.983 --> 01:52:40.720
when I. Also what color feet

01:52:40.787 --> 01:52:42.689
which is like for your home.

01:52:42.755 --> 01:52:43.223
And I think that's very

01:52:43.289 --> 01:52:44.791
important because it take into

01:52:44.858 --> 01:52:47.227
consideration our names tend.

01:52:47.293 --> 01:52:47.827
To you know make it our home

01:52:47.894 --> 01:52:48.795
because it is our home so we

01:52:48.862 --> 01:52:50.997
have to make sure that we're

01:52:51.064 --> 01:52:51.631
happy with the services that

01:52:51.698 --> 01:52:52.765
your house. Is up to call their

01:52:52.832 --> 01:52:56.636
house is safe and their houses

01:52:56.703 --> 01:52:57.270
comfortable because you to live

01:52:57.337 --> 01:53:00.540
in it. I see Lara mono. See I

01:53:00.607 --> 01:53:04.744
have a- level yeah lead can be

01:53:04.811 --> 01:53:06.713
a very silent please and you

01:53:06.779 --> 01:53:08.815
can be exposed to lead you

01:53:08.882 --> 01:53:10.617
convene poison lead and appear

01:53:10.683 --> 01:53:12.819
or look healthy for some time

01:53:12.886 --> 01:53:14.587
until those symptoms start to

01:53:14.654 --> 01:53:16.589
appear so it's important for

01:53:16.656 --> 01:53:17.157
parents to know that even

01:53:17.223 --> 01:53:18.591
though your children me looking

01:53:18.658 --> 01:53:19.159
if you're healthy now they

01:53:19.225 --> 01:53:20.527
could be incurring lead

01:53:20.593 --> 01:53:22.495
exposure in those homes and

01:53:22.562 --> 01:53:23.029
addressing that issue is

01:53:23.096 --> 01:53:24.597
extremely important to do now

01:53:24.664 --> 01:53:36.543
to avoid problems later. This

01:53:36.609 --> 01:53:38.778
definitely sets the stage the

01:53:38.845 --> 01:53:40.780
allocation of these funds to

01:53:40.847 --> 01:53:42.682
address lead paint in homes is

01:53:42.749 --> 01:53:44.551
unprecedented. And to do the

01:53:44.617 --> 01:53:45.151
number of homes in the time

01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:46.619
period that we're going to do

01:53:46.686 --> 01:53:47.153
them it's going to set a

01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:48.821
tremendous example for the rest

01:53:48.888 --> 01:53:50.590
of the country. We targeted

01:53:50.657 --> 01:53:51.191
those particular areas because

01:53:51.257 --> 01:53:52.825
these are areas that we know

01:53:52.892 --> 01:53:54.694
have a lot of old housing stock

01:53:54.761 --> 01:53:55.261
and we know that this is an

01:53:55.328 --> 01:53:56.863
under represented population as

01:53:56.930 --> 01:54:13.079
well. One of the most common

01:54:13.146 --> 01:54:14.681
ways to address lead paint in

01:54:14.747 --> 01:54:15.315
homes was assembly paint over

01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:17.283
it but this is a comprehensive

01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:19.052
way to get the lead paint out

01:54:19.118 --> 01:54:20.987
of office and to renovate them

01:54:21.054 --> 01:54:22.755
to the point where lead is no

01:54:22.822 --> 01:54:42.742
longer risk to the structure.

01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:46.546
My parents have lived here for.

01:54:46.613 --> 01:54:48.648
Thirty three years so the have

01:54:48.715 --> 01:54:50.783
been offering to remove the

01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:52.852
pain that. May contain less and

01:54:52.919 --> 01:54:54.921
hopefully that can be of good

01:54:54.988 --> 01:54:57.056
to our nieces and nephews to

01:54:57.123 --> 01:54:57.657
actually come in this of the

01:54:57.724 --> 01:54:58.958
house. And our cousins who are

01:54:59.025 --> 01:55:01.060
actually pregnant so you know I

01:55:01.127 --> 01:55:02.795
know that that's pretty

01:55:02.862 --> 01:55:04.631
hazardous for their house. I'm

01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:05.265
glad that they came and offered

01:55:05.331 --> 01:55:06.899
like. More more information

01:55:06.966 --> 01:55:12.538
about it. You see all this. Hi

01:55:12.605 --> 01:55:14.774
highlighter. Those are the ones

01:55:14.841 --> 01:55:16.743
are interested. But I'm a

01:55:16.809 --> 01:55:18.811
little for the acre goodness

01:55:18.878 --> 01:55:20.713
will be implicated the three

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:24.550
most common as well say Los a

01:55:24.617 --> 01:55:25.184
automotive Chen us get benefit

01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:26.986
us us and giving an insight on

01:55:27.053 --> 01:55:40.667
this because you. Number zero

01:55:40.733 --> 01:55:44.604
one zero down. Who is that I

01:55:44.671 --> 01:55:45.138
guess we're going to build

01:55:45.204 --> 01:55:46.639
before today either well give

01:55:46.706 --> 01:55:47.307
you a quick demo on some of the

01:55:47.373 --> 01:55:49.142
tools are going to use that are

01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:50.977
using I'm not to get her all

01:55:51.044 --> 01:55:52.779
and as a result of training

01:55:52.845 --> 01:55:54.814
these experts in order to go

01:55:54.881 --> 01:55:56.683
into homes and not only do the

01:55:56.749 --> 01:55:58.551
deconstruction reconstruction

01:55:58.618 --> 01:56:00.787
but to specifically address the

01:56:00.853 --> 01:56:02.555
idea that lead paint is a

01:56:02.622 --> 01:56:04.724
hazard to young children and to

01:56:04.791 --> 01:56:05.358
the people of those households.

01:56:05.425 --> 01:56:06.959
This creates a new work force

01:56:07.026 --> 01:56:08.961
and new workforce it's able to

01:56:09.028 --> 01:56:09.529
go into these homes and not

01:56:09.595 --> 01:56:11.164
only address the problems of

01:56:11.230 --> 01:56:13.032
renovation of the problems of

01:56:13.099 --> 01:56:24.744
lackey. When my idea of fun

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:26.913
nation. Or what the Downey

01:56:26.979 --> 01:56:28.981
program came. And we started

01:56:29.048 --> 01:56:31.084
doing the lead mitigation on

01:56:31.150 --> 01:56:33.086
the paint. I love the neighbors

01:56:33.152 --> 01:56:34.921
star a like kind of being

01:56:34.987 --> 01:56:36.656
curious and asking questions

01:56:36.723 --> 01:56:38.925
how can I get my housing to the

01:56:38.991 --> 01:56:39.559
program. When we talk to our

01:56:39.625 --> 01:56:41.027
neighbors or we're always like

01:56:41.094 --> 01:56:43.096
quick to say like. Oh by the

01:56:43.162 --> 01:56:46.799
way. You know your house is in

01:56:46.866 --> 01:56:47.367
the contaminated area you

01:56:47.433 --> 01:56:50.770
should. Contact this lesion

01:56:50.837 --> 01:56:52.872
long online. This effort is not

01:56:52.939 --> 01:56:53.406
only designed to renovate

01:56:53.473 --> 01:56:55.074
individual homes but it is

01:56:55.141 --> 01:56:56.576
designed to renovate entire

01:56:56.642 --> 01:56:57.076
neighborhoods it's not

01:56:57.143 --> 01:56:59.078
something that people should

01:56:59.145 --> 01:56:59.712
simply have to live with this

01:56:59.779 --> 01:57:01.147
is something that should be

01:57:01.214 --> 01:57:02.749
addressed as comprehensively as

01:57:02.815 --> 01:57:04.851
possible to get that let him

01:57:04.917 --> 01:57:05.451
out. And to have a life free

01:57:05.518 --> 01:57:06.953
help. You know when you see

01:57:07.019 --> 01:57:09.088
something. And see it happen

01:57:09.155 --> 01:57:11.090
then you know you can hear more

01:57:11.157 --> 01:57:13.159
yak nine find out as opposed to

01:57:13.226 --> 01:57:16.662
someone just telling you. But

01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:17.263
then you know you. Get senior

01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:21.067
in India. Now from our initial

01:57:21.134 --> 01:57:23.069
thoughts of. Yeah know a that

01:57:23.136 --> 01:57:25.138
going to have. And then. You

01:57:25.204 --> 01:57:32.779
know and actually did. Well

01:57:32.845 --> 01:57:33.346
thank you for that thank you

01:57:33.413 --> 01:57:34.981
for all the reasons tions and

01:57:35.047 --> 01:57:37.283
John we will move on to public

01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:41.120
comment now- I did receive one.

01:57:41.187 --> 01:57:43.256
A card that has the comment

01:57:43.322 --> 01:57:44.924
written on it and I think it's

01:57:44.991 --> 01:57:45.525
a Clara cation a request for

01:57:45.591 --> 01:57:46.893
clarification that's an

01:57:46.959 --> 01:57:49.128
important one it is from-

01:57:49.195 --> 01:57:50.930
Martha Jimenez who is with the

01:57:50.997 --> 01:57:54.834
excited vice re committee- and-

01:57:54.901 --> 01:57:56.869
city terrace. United at request

01:57:56.936 --> 01:58:00.873
clarification- for everyone- a

01:58:00.940 --> 01:58:02.942
by DTS see- and I think it

01:58:03.009 --> 01:58:06.813
expresses a misunderstanding-

01:58:06.879 --> 01:58:11.150
about- the- non prosecution

01:58:11.217 --> 01:58:14.854
agreement- so what I will I

01:58:14.921 --> 01:58:17.190
want to- make sure that we're

01:58:17.256 --> 01:58:19.192
clear about this. And if either

01:58:19.258 --> 01:58:21.027
doctor Williams at director

01:58:21.093 --> 01:58:22.929
Williams or a director- deputy

01:58:22.995 --> 01:58:26.933
director coke want to address

01:58:26.999 --> 01:58:27.533
this further than a statement

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:28.935
I'll make right now please do

01:58:29.001 --> 01:58:30.803
so and correct me if I'm wrong.

01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:33.172
But the non prosecution

01:58:33.239 --> 01:58:35.208
agreement- does not mean that

01:58:35.274 --> 01:58:37.143
excite is being let off the

01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:41.013
hook. Quite the contrary- right

01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:43.249
now the federal government has

01:58:43.316 --> 01:58:45.251
entered into an agreement that

01:58:45.318 --> 01:58:48.888
says we won't prosecute Exide

01:58:48.955 --> 01:58:52.892
for crimes the non the if we

01:58:52.959 --> 01:58:54.927
get rid of the non prosecution

01:58:54.994 --> 01:58:57.096
agreement then Exide can be

01:58:57.163 --> 01:59:00.900
current prosecuted for the acts

01:59:00.967 --> 01:59:02.802
that they've committed whatever

01:59:02.869 --> 01:59:04.871
they might be charged with by

01:59:04.937 --> 01:59:05.505
the federal government. So it

01:59:05.571 --> 01:59:09.041
actually. Has the effect of

01:59:09.108 --> 01:59:11.277
creating additional liability-

01:59:11.344 --> 01:59:13.112
not less is that essentially

01:59:13.179 --> 01:59:16.983
accurate. So hopefully that to

01:59:17.049 --> 01:59:19.051
clear that up but it's a very

01:59:19.118 --> 01:59:22.788
important clarification- and

01:59:22.855 --> 01:59:24.857
to- I'm glad that you asked the

01:59:24.924 --> 01:59:25.358
question if there's any

01:59:25.424 --> 01:59:27.226
confusion out there- sore first

01:59:27.293 --> 01:59:29.161
up public comment if you'd like

01:59:29.228 --> 01:59:30.897
to step four would come from-

01:59:30.963 --> 01:59:32.965
Jane Williams and then will

01:59:33.032 --> 01:59:34.901
follow that with Joe Gonzalez.

01:59:34.967 --> 01:59:48.981
And senior John. Thanks for

01:59:49.048 --> 01:59:53.586
being here. I'm James I'm the

01:59:53.653 --> 01:59:55.187
executive director of

01:59:55.254 --> 01:59:57.023
California communities toxics

01:59:57.089 --> 02:00:00.993
and- I brought my excited file

02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:02.962
in a read it here on the train

02:00:03.029 --> 02:00:07.199
down in my file I had the notes

02:00:07.266 --> 02:00:09.368
from my meeting with secretary

02:00:09.435 --> 02:00:11.103
right Regus now almost five

02:00:11.170 --> 02:00:14.807
years ago. Which had the

02:00:14.874 --> 02:00:17.243
original agreement in it or the

02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:17.843
clean up of excitement and the

02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:27.019
closure. A that was. Well less

02:00:27.086 --> 02:00:28.955
than fifty million dollars now

02:00:29.021 --> 02:00:30.890
the cleanup is expected to cost

02:00:30.957 --> 02:00:32.959
most of billion dollars and

02:00:33.025 --> 02:00:37.029
take at least ten years. We are

02:00:37.096 --> 02:00:39.031
still not prepared for the

02:00:39.098 --> 02:00:41.033
magnitude of this clean up-

02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:43.369
despite passing the to better

02:00:43.436 --> 02:00:45.171
if you bills- we are

02:00:45.237 --> 02:00:49.141
desperately in need of the same

02:00:49.208 --> 02:00:51.310
things that we talked about

02:00:51.377 --> 02:00:52.912
when we had this oversight

02:00:52.979 --> 02:00:55.081
hearing last year which was we

02:00:55.147 --> 02:01:00.920
need a long term save. Agency

02:01:00.987 --> 02:01:03.189
because the clean up the

02:01:03.255 --> 02:01:06.892
details he is running. Fraught

02:01:06.959 --> 02:01:11.030
with problems and that such a

02:01:11.097 --> 02:01:17.036
that. For your still has not

02:01:17.103 --> 02:01:21.073
been able to get a copy if. The

02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:21.507
legislature can get

02:01:21.574 --> 02:01:23.576
accountability from the agency

02:01:23.643 --> 02:01:25.044
but I would say that the các

02:01:25.111 --> 02:01:27.179
members you have who are here

02:01:27.246 --> 02:01:27.780
in the audience have kind of

02:01:27.847 --> 02:01:35.087
lost hope. So ever the Lech.

02:01:35.154 --> 02:01:35.655
They're trying to fix that

02:01:35.721 --> 02:01:46.999
problem back there. Keep your.

02:01:47.066 --> 02:01:51.203
Uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh push the

02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:56.942
button on the base. Yeah okay.

02:01:57.009 --> 02:01:59.712
So this is this is not

02:01:59.779 --> 02:02:01.080
something this is not the

02:02:01.147 --> 02:02:01.714
problem that we have with ex I

02:02:01.781 --> 02:02:04.917
clean up is not gonna go away

02:02:04.984 --> 02:02:07.286
we'll be here next year will be

02:02:07.353 --> 02:02:09.121
here next year will be here

02:02:09.188 --> 02:02:09.689
next year. Will be here next

02:02:09.755 --> 02:02:11.390
year. We still don't have

02:02:11.457 --> 02:02:13.392
enough money. Even with the

02:02:13.459 --> 02:02:17.129
battery fee and we don't have

02:02:17.196 --> 02:02:17.763
the kind of accountability from

02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:21.100
the agency that we need to my

02:02:21.167 --> 02:02:21.567
recommendation to the

02:02:21.634 --> 02:02:23.369
legislature last year was to

02:02:23.436 --> 02:02:25.004
create a long term stable

02:02:25.071 --> 02:02:27.139
source of funding. We were able

02:02:27.206 --> 02:02:27.707
to get forty million a year

02:02:27.773 --> 02:02:29.208
through the battery she you can

02:02:29.275 --> 02:02:31.610
see that that's probably not

02:02:31.677 --> 02:02:33.212
going to be enough. On because

02:02:33.279 --> 02:02:33.713
there's gonna be other

02:02:33.779 --> 02:02:35.347
pressures on the fee as well.

02:02:35.414 --> 02:02:37.283
And we cannot get

02:02:37.349 --> 02:02:41.353
accountability from do TSC- I

02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:43.255
understand the you know the

02:02:43.322 --> 02:02:45.024
real reform package but I don't

02:02:45.091 --> 02:02:45.558
think that anybody who's

02:02:45.624 --> 02:02:47.226
watching the agency as long as

02:02:47.293 --> 02:02:49.395
I have been. Or other folks

02:02:49.462 --> 02:02:49.995
have been watching it in the

02:02:50.062 --> 02:02:51.497
last five years things that and

02:02:51.564 --> 02:02:53.532
oversight- board is going to

02:02:53.599 --> 02:02:57.069
solve the exite problem. So I

02:02:57.136 --> 02:03:01.173
leave you with that. I wish I

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:03.743
had a different. Recommendation

02:03:03.809 --> 02:03:05.411
for you. And we definitely will

02:03:05.478 --> 02:03:07.079
support the audit the

02:03:07.146 --> 02:03:07.646
Assemblymembers Thiago is

02:03:07.713 --> 02:03:09.515
asking for. Thank you for a

02:03:09.582 --> 02:03:11.517
comma. A next up we have Joe

02:03:11.584 --> 02:03:15.454
Gonzalez. Welcome good evening-

02:03:15.521 --> 02:03:17.556
thank you all for attending I

02:03:17.623 --> 02:03:19.425
really appreciate this we need

02:03:19.492 --> 02:03:21.327
more meetings like this we it's

02:03:21.393 --> 02:03:21.961
really really hard to squeeze

02:03:22.027 --> 02:03:23.929
ugh eight nine years of battle

02:03:23.996 --> 02:03:25.364
into a couple of minutes- I

02:03:25.431 --> 02:03:27.032
want to thank especially

02:03:27.099 --> 02:03:27.633
supervised release one of the

02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:29.401
heroes of are. Contaminated

02:03:29.468 --> 02:03:31.437
issue here that we're going

02:03:31.504 --> 02:03:35.141
through and- hopefully we can

02:03:35.207 --> 02:03:35.741
get more funding to the public

02:03:35.808 --> 02:03:37.409
that the PH we need this

02:03:37.476 --> 02:03:39.145
additional funnies we can

02:03:39.211 --> 02:03:39.745
extend the kind of testing so

02:03:39.812 --> 02:03:41.447
we can find out what this is

02:03:41.514 --> 02:03:43.582
that we're actually feeling as

02:03:43.649 --> 02:03:45.184
you see this used to be my-

02:03:45.251 --> 02:03:47.419
day. These are health field

02:03:47.486 --> 02:03:49.421
medical tag from the last two

02:03:49.488 --> 02:03:51.557
years only and this is about

02:03:51.624 --> 02:03:53.125
only half of the stuff that

02:03:53.192 --> 02:03:55.161
I've gone through as far as

02:03:55.227 --> 02:03:55.628
radiation treatments

02:03:55.694 --> 02:03:59.198
chemotherapy MRI scans of

02:03:59.265 --> 02:03:59.765
everything that that comes

02:03:59.832 --> 02:04:03.269
along with being contaminated

02:04:03.335 --> 02:04:03.836
and poisoned by this stuff

02:04:03.903 --> 02:04:07.206
here- like doctor Rangoon was

02:04:07.273 --> 02:04:09.441
saying was weekend. It's hard

02:04:09.508 --> 02:04:11.844
to do a judge exactly what we

02:04:11.911 --> 02:04:13.179
have been going through but we

02:04:13.245 --> 02:04:15.514
need more no well unless we

02:04:15.581 --> 02:04:17.416
have more so we can get like

02:04:17.483 --> 02:04:17.950
say the bone studies or

02:04:18.017 --> 02:04:19.552
something like this we don't

02:04:19.618 --> 02:04:21.387
really know what we're facing

02:04:21.453 --> 02:04:23.422
in and the we need more

02:04:23.489 --> 02:04:25.157
appropriations from this.

02:04:25.224 --> 02:04:29.428
Committee here okay. What need.

02:04:29.495 --> 02:04:31.597
Is a thing that kind of. Angers

02:04:31.664 --> 02:04:33.365
frustrates more for. I get any

02:04:33.432 --> 02:04:35.234
about this because I dying any.

02:04:35.301 --> 02:04:35.801
But the in frustrates me is

02:04:35.868 --> 02:04:37.336
that we keep hearing or DTS see

02:04:37.403 --> 02:04:39.438
talk about. All we cling to

02:04:39.505 --> 02:04:41.607
thousand homes only cleaned up

02:04:41.674 --> 02:04:42.241
two thousand three thousand all

02:04:42.308 --> 02:04:43.576
of the old. It's kind of like

02:04:43.642 --> 02:04:45.511
you trying to get some sort of

02:04:45.578 --> 02:04:47.146
hysteria but all good you are

02:04:47.213 --> 02:04:49.381
the bottom line the truth is

02:04:49.448 --> 02:04:51.150
you have a clean up one single.

02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:53.352
Because of I just do like this.

02:04:53.419 --> 02:04:53.953
Doesn't mean the entire stages

02:04:54.019 --> 02:04:55.721
clean. They haven't cleaned the

02:04:55.788 --> 02:04:57.623
attics. It took a long time for

02:04:57.690 --> 02:05:00.025
them to try to clean the

02:05:00.092 --> 02:05:00.626
parkways. And the fact of the

02:05:00.693 --> 02:05:03.262
matter is that. We made test. A

02:05:03.329 --> 02:05:05.631
parkway. That need remediation

02:05:05.698 --> 02:05:07.366
but not a whole. That doesn't

02:05:07.433 --> 02:05:09.702
make sense we don't have a good

02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:11.470
plan- PTSD is letting us down

02:05:11.537 --> 02:05:15.241
tremendously. They do not have.

02:05:15.307 --> 02:05:17.376
An expedient nor efficient

02:05:17.443 --> 02:05:19.345
plan. We're talking about where

02:05:19.411 --> 02:05:19.945
the cuts the often and ways to

02:05:20.012 --> 02:05:23.482
cut costs. The easiest simplest

02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:25.651
long ago asked of them we ask

02:05:25.718 --> 02:05:27.453
them to do if you do a block by

02:05:27.519 --> 02:05:30.122
block you sweep. If you're

02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:31.457
gonna do a partial here and a

02:05:31.523 --> 02:05:33.325
partial there when you talk

02:05:33.392 --> 02:05:33.859
about individual parcels.

02:05:33.926 --> 02:05:35.494
Arsenal turns into entire block

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:37.463
you're talking about more

02:05:37.529 --> 02:05:39.365
efficiently spending this

02:05:39.431 --> 02:05:39.932
money. You're talking about

02:05:39.999 --> 02:05:41.634
cleaning this right the first

02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:42.234
time not having to come back

02:05:42.301 --> 02:05:43.869
again a second or maybe a third

02:05:43.936 --> 02:05:51.744
time. Yeah. Wait what we need

02:05:51.810 --> 02:05:52.344
is we need some oversight on

02:05:52.411 --> 02:05:55.481
this too I mean it we have. I

02:05:55.547 --> 02:05:56.081
think was I forget what the

02:05:56.148 --> 02:05:57.683
number was it came from the

02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:59.418
state we have a couple of

02:05:59.485 --> 02:06:00.085
million also the came from the

02:06:00.152 --> 02:06:01.620
county. We have the battery tax

02:06:01.687 --> 02:06:03.255
which this community is really

02:06:03.322 --> 02:06:05.257
really upset these communities

02:06:05.324 --> 02:06:05.858
are really really upset that

02:06:05.925 --> 02:06:07.493
battery tax was a- imposing

02:06:07.559 --> 02:06:09.728
created so that we can address

02:06:09.795 --> 02:06:11.630
the exite. But yet we're being

02:06:11.697 --> 02:06:13.365
told that this some of this

02:06:13.432 --> 02:06:13.966
money is going to go outside.

02:06:14.033 --> 02:06:15.701
Up north in all these other

02:06:15.768 --> 02:06:17.369
areas like this and- in I don't

02:06:17.436 --> 02:06:19.605
have a problem with that if we

02:06:19.672 --> 02:06:20.139
can clean up our mess your

02:06:20.205 --> 02:06:21.740
first. Okay this is the public

02:06:21.807 --> 02:06:23.542
health crisis I don't

02:06:23.609 --> 02:06:25.377
understand what the deal is

02:06:25.444 --> 02:06:27.413
were. We're trying to say well

02:06:27.479 --> 02:06:27.913
we can't get into that

02:06:27.980 --> 02:06:29.548
property- we can't- get this

02:06:29.615 --> 02:06:31.250
person permission. Is a public

02:06:31.317 --> 02:06:31.850
health crisis. Nobody has my

02:06:31.917 --> 02:06:33.786
neighbor does not have a right.

02:06:33.852 --> 02:06:35.587
To get me the kids or anybody

02:06:35.654 --> 02:06:37.556
else sec. But leaving their-

02:06:37.623 --> 02:06:39.425
amination. To a point where it

02:06:39.491 --> 02:06:41.393
can flow into my- property. And

02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:41.927
get me or my good for the

02:06:41.994 --> 02:06:45.331
children sick. You know so I'm

02:06:45.397 --> 02:06:47.433
trying to follow the de.

02:06:47.499 --> 02:06:48.100
Stories that they're giving us

02:06:48.167 --> 02:06:49.568
about pro high priority homes.

02:06:49.635 --> 02:06:51.537
The high priority holding came

02:06:51.603 --> 02:06:53.339
out about seven years ago. Up

02:06:53.405 --> 02:06:53.872
and it was addressed to

02:06:53.939 --> 02:06:55.708
pregnant women. And children

02:06:55.774 --> 02:06:57.643
under five. I guarantee you

02:06:57.710 --> 02:07:00.112
there's nobody who was seven

02:07:00.179 --> 02:07:00.779
years ago pregnant is no longer

02:07:00.846 --> 02:07:01.513
pregnant- and are still

02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:03.615
pregnant I should say. And

02:07:03.682 --> 02:07:04.149
there's no children don't

02:07:04.216 --> 02:07:05.684
children that were under five

02:07:05.751 --> 02:07:07.720
they're still under five seven

02:07:07.786 --> 02:07:09.355
from seven years ago. And this

02:07:09.421 --> 02:07:09.989
is the story that we're facing

02:07:10.055 --> 02:07:11.490
every single day were not

02:07:11.557 --> 02:07:13.459
getting. Real facts from our

02:07:13.525 --> 02:07:13.993
from our of the TS in you

02:07:14.059 --> 02:07:15.694
talked about text messaging.

02:07:15.761 --> 02:07:17.696
I'll take that I mean just let

02:07:17.763 --> 02:07:19.665
me know. There's nobody who has

02:07:19.732 --> 02:07:21.367
been to more meetings I don't

02:07:21.433 --> 02:07:21.900
think to myself. You know

02:07:21.967 --> 02:07:23.669
concert in the TNC concerning

02:07:23.736 --> 02:07:25.771
excite. And stuff like that I

02:07:25.838 --> 02:07:27.339
think I missed one when I was

02:07:27.406 --> 02:07:27.940
really out of one of my cancer

02:07:28.007 --> 02:07:29.708
episodes. And up. I think all

02:07:29.775 --> 02:07:33.612
together in all the- nine years

02:07:33.679 --> 02:07:34.246
ten years we're fighting this.

02:07:34.313 --> 02:07:35.848
I've gotten like maybe. Two or

02:07:35.914 --> 02:07:37.616
three. Letters to my home.

02:07:37.683 --> 02:07:39.718
Regarding meetings and stuff

02:07:39.785 --> 02:07:41.887
like that everything else I

02:07:41.954 --> 02:07:42.454
have to go out there and put

02:07:42.521 --> 02:07:43.522
you know footwork. Look for the

02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:45.524
stuff we're not getting the

02:07:45.591 --> 02:07:46.158
stuff. And what also gets me

02:07:46.225 --> 02:07:47.860
too is we don't have the P. S.

02:07:47.926 --> 02:07:49.528
A.'s that we need we need

02:07:49.595 --> 02:07:50.095
something. We don't have to

02:07:50.162 --> 02:07:51.597
point a finger. Right an

02:07:51.663 --> 02:07:53.499
exciting perhaps you know put

02:07:53.565 --> 02:07:55.334
some sort of liability into the

02:07:55.401 --> 02:07:55.934
county or- state or something

02:07:56.001 --> 02:07:59.705
like that are. You know miss

02:07:59.772 --> 02:08:00.272
something that this up right

02:08:00.339 --> 02:08:01.774
there. But we do have to let

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:02.408
the- know. That what we facing

02:08:02.474 --> 02:08:04.009
we go home. What what the kids

02:08:04.076 --> 02:08:05.711
are facing when they walk to

02:08:05.778 --> 02:08:06.311
school back to school what's

02:08:06.378 --> 02:08:07.913
out of playing the yard and

02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:09.448
stuff like that. We need to let

02:08:09.515 --> 02:08:10.049
the people know how to take

02:08:10.115 --> 02:08:11.550
care of themselves. We didn't

02:08:11.617 --> 02:08:12.184
we need to let them know that

02:08:12.251 --> 02:08:13.719
there's a danger. We have had

02:08:13.786 --> 02:08:14.319
many family that have moved

02:08:14.386 --> 02:08:15.854
into the neighborhood. Thinking

02:08:15.921 --> 02:08:17.823
they were going to. You know

02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:19.658
have the American dream. Reyes

02:08:19.725 --> 02:08:21.393
a vampire home raise a family.

02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:23.562
And live the American dream you

02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:25.397
know. So your child play

02:08:25.464 --> 02:08:25.998
baseball and- graduated from

02:08:26.065 --> 02:08:27.833
high school walking down the

02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:30.002
aisle stuff like that. But yet

02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:30.602
unfortunately what's happened

02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:31.537
is many many families here. And

02:08:31.603 --> 02:08:33.705
if we have a few families are

02:08:33.772 --> 02:08:34.306
just recently of with moved in

02:08:34.373 --> 02:08:36.075
the neighborhoods. You don't

02:08:36.141 --> 02:08:37.810
know a thing about what's going

02:08:37.876 --> 02:08:39.878
on. And their children were

02:08:39.945 --> 02:08:41.547
coming up. Here learning

02:08:41.613 --> 02:08:42.114
disabilities and stuff like

02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:43.549
this we know there's a lot of

02:08:43.615 --> 02:08:45.517
learning disability that's why

02:08:45.584 --> 02:08:46.118
just recently. I think of the

02:08:46.185 --> 02:08:49.588
state. Also wanted to adopt or

02:08:49.655 --> 02:08:51.390
raise the school level scores.

02:08:51.457 --> 02:08:51.957
At some of the local high

02:08:52.024 --> 02:08:53.892
schools up by twenty percent.

02:08:53.959 --> 02:08:55.727
And again they targeted Boyle

02:08:55.794 --> 02:08:57.596
heights by because we were at

02:08:57.663 --> 02:08:58.063
the epicenter. Of this

02:08:58.130 --> 02:08:59.798
contamination from that thank

02:08:59.865 --> 02:09:00.299
you very much for your

02:09:00.365 --> 02:09:01.767
comments. Okay I see the real

02:09:01.834 --> 02:09:03.869
hard it's real hard to squeeze

02:09:03.936 --> 02:09:04.503
like eight years into something

02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:05.971
that's why when I understand we

02:09:06.038 --> 02:09:07.806
need more meetings that's like.

02:09:07.873 --> 02:09:08.440
Not even half of what I got to

02:09:08.507 --> 02:09:09.641
play some of it is. Much more

02:09:09.708 --> 02:09:11.877
important I. Whether respect

02:09:11.944 --> 02:09:13.812
like. Thank thank you we

02:09:13.879 --> 02:09:15.647
appreciate that- next we have-

02:09:15.714 --> 02:09:18.150
Monsignor John and- that would

02:09:18.217 --> 02:09:23.589
be followed by Terry Cano. And

02:09:23.655 --> 02:09:24.156
Stephanie Casteel. Yes good

02:09:24.223 --> 02:09:25.824
evening thanks for. Here this

02:09:25.891 --> 02:09:26.525
evening and- we want to welcome

02:09:26.592 --> 02:09:29.661
all of you again and- I just

02:09:29.728 --> 02:09:30.295
want to. You at the attic door

02:09:30.362 --> 02:09:33.765
last night we had the- H. U. N.

02:09:33.832 --> 02:09:35.667
D. was here DTS he was here on

02:09:35.734 --> 02:09:37.569
Wednesday night and now you're

02:09:37.636 --> 02:09:38.170
committees here. I don't think

02:09:38.237 --> 02:09:39.872
Dr Jill it Johnson she's not

02:09:39.938 --> 02:09:41.974
here she- she had here tonight

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.842
was she was here last night.

02:09:43.909 --> 02:09:47.479
Are you familiar with her study

02:09:47.546 --> 02:09:48.013
that she did on the baby's

02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:49.648
teeth. Now I just leave this

02:09:49.715 --> 02:09:51.750
ending. It does show the

02:09:51.817 --> 02:09:53.986
urgency of this problem- Dr

02:09:54.052 --> 02:09:57.856
Jill. Is a research scientist

02:09:57.923 --> 02:09:59.691
at USC that que. The school of

02:09:59.758 --> 02:10:01.793
medicine. And she got funded do

02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:04.396
this test. To compare the

02:10:04.463 --> 02:10:05.797
baby's teeth of our babies

02:10:05.864 --> 02:10:07.799
teeth here. As of those two

02:10:07.866 --> 02:10:09.868
other area another area. And

02:10:09.935 --> 02:10:13.572
when she did this test- if

02:10:13.639 --> 02:10:15.807
found out that our babies teeth

02:10:15.874 --> 02:10:16.475
in comparison to the amount of

02:10:16.542 --> 02:10:19.845
lead. Despite its just bikes in

02:10:19.912 --> 02:10:20.412
comparison to the community

02:10:20.479 --> 02:10:22.247
that she- said. Our baby's T.

02:10:22.314 --> 02:10:25.617
that means. That those babies.

02:10:25.684 --> 02:10:30.756
Are will be. I'm not a doctor.

02:10:30.822 --> 02:10:31.423
But it is it's a very serious

02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:33.559
problem. And SO we live in as

02:10:33.625 --> 02:10:35.827
is condition when I. Say that.

02:10:35.894 --> 02:10:37.629
It shall eat up to two. Spoons

02:10:37.696 --> 02:10:39.831
is a table sponsored table just

02:10:39.898 --> 02:10:41.800
is to have a- of doing it a

02:10:41.867 --> 02:10:45.604
day- our protocol has been

02:10:45.671 --> 02:10:46.171
there for the last. Several

02:10:46.238 --> 02:10:47.940
years. They're they're supposed

02:10:48.006 --> 02:10:50.042
to wash the feet the did take

02:10:50.108 --> 02:10:50.642
their shoes off- don't come

02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:52.044
into your dog should wash their

02:10:52.110 --> 02:10:53.845
feet before the game. The house

02:10:53.912 --> 02:10:55.881
down the food from the floor.

02:10:55.948 --> 02:10:57.716
This goes on for years and

02:10:57.783 --> 02:10:59.885
years- the final one it just

02:10:59.952 --> 02:11:01.753
ask that this equipment aye. No

02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:02.387
one's been able to really give

02:11:02.454 --> 02:11:03.855
me a good answer. Why is it.

02:11:03.922 --> 02:11:06.158
That if this houses been tested

02:11:06.225 --> 02:11:08.026
this spend all this money and

02:11:08.093 --> 02:11:09.761
testing the house. And they

02:11:09.828 --> 02:11:10.395
have agreed the children live

02:11:10.462 --> 02:11:12.898
in there. As soon fit all the

02:11:12.965 --> 02:11:13.966
qualities. That lead is a

02:11:14.032 --> 02:11:15.901
certain level. Why do they have

02:11:15.968 --> 02:11:17.903
to go back. Test the parkways

02:11:17.970 --> 02:11:20.038
why you said tonight the

02:11:20.105 --> 02:11:23.642
details he- told us that it was

02:11:23.709 --> 02:11:24.176
going to be UP I think two

02:11:24.243 --> 02:11:25.844
thousand and two. Before they

02:11:25.911 --> 02:11:27.813
would to finalize our plans

02:11:27.879 --> 02:11:35.654
after the do the test. Into

02:11:35.721 --> 02:11:36.255
dollars on testing. I'm not a

02:11:36.321 --> 02:11:38.023
done I miss. But I seem to me

02:11:38.090 --> 02:11:39.691
that logic. Is if I have let in

02:11:39.758 --> 02:11:40.325
this. I'm a and with that. Feet

02:11:40.392 --> 02:11:43.695
of. It for. From the blog way I

02:11:43.762 --> 02:11:44.296
should have lead over there

02:11:44.363 --> 02:11:46.131
also just doesn't. Doesn't aye

02:11:46.198 --> 02:11:47.866
I've asked this question before

02:11:47.933 --> 02:11:49.935
and you just get a B. S.

02:11:50.002 --> 02:11:51.770
answers so. I just to submit

02:11:51.837 --> 02:11:53.672
that to the people you heard

02:11:53.739 --> 02:11:54.239
that figures tonight you're

02:11:54.306 --> 02:11:56.041
part of the budget committee so

02:11:56.108 --> 02:11:58.043
please- I think this one way we

02:11:58.110 --> 02:11:59.978
could save millions of dollars

02:12:00.045 --> 02:12:02.014
in and- advance our clean up

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:04.249
faster than it is. Being

02:12:04.316 --> 02:12:05.951
program right now thank you

02:12:06.018 --> 02:12:07.986
very much thank you. And thank

02:12:08.053 --> 02:12:10.088
you again for the use of the

02:12:10.155 --> 02:12:16.361
facility- a Terry Cano is next.

02:12:16.428 --> 02:12:17.729
Follow by Stephanie because-

02:12:17.796 --> 02:12:21.967
and to. I'm not sure if Martha

02:12:22.034 --> 02:12:23.802
Jimenez is still here but- may

02:12:23.869 --> 02:12:27.906
also have a comment. I can

02:12:27.973 --> 02:12:31.777
reach. Okay so- I'm Terry

02:12:31.843 --> 02:12:35.714
Connell. I don't even know

02:12:35.781 --> 02:12:36.315
where to start first let me

02:12:36.381 --> 02:12:38.150
address some of the questions

02:12:38.216 --> 02:12:39.918
that I have regarding the

02:12:39.985 --> 02:12:42.154
contracts of first and foremost

02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:44.056
the sixteen hundred they said

02:12:44.122 --> 02:12:47.626
they they could not get access.

02:12:47.693 --> 02:12:51.630
To the test. I know resident.

02:12:51.697 --> 02:12:54.032
Who wants it who is a part of

02:12:54.099 --> 02:12:56.101
that sixteen hundred who wanted

02:12:56.168 --> 02:12:57.936
to get their property tested in

02:12:58.003 --> 02:12:59.738
this is just a couple of weeks

02:12:59.805 --> 02:13:00.272
ago. And we should contact

02:13:00.339 --> 02:13:03.608
them. To get her property tax-

02:13:03.675 --> 02:13:05.811
tested they said that they were

02:13:05.877 --> 02:13:07.779
unable to get those that get

02:13:07.846 --> 02:13:09.748
her property tested because

02:13:09.815 --> 02:13:11.616
they don't have a current

02:13:11.683 --> 02:13:13.852
contract for. Testing those

02:13:13.919 --> 02:13:15.954
additional sixteen hundred we

02:13:16.021 --> 02:13:17.789
didn't hear that from them. So

02:13:17.856 --> 02:13:19.891
unless that's changed like

02:13:19.958 --> 02:13:21.760
within the last couple of days.

02:13:21.827 --> 02:13:23.862
That's something they should of.

02:13:23.929 --> 02:13:27.632
Told you guys so out of those

02:13:27.699 --> 02:13:28.266
sixteen hundred that I know of

02:13:28.333 --> 02:13:29.901
what they were told what they

02:13:29.968 --> 02:13:31.870
told this- property owner was

02:13:31.937 --> 02:13:33.772
at the do they do not have a

02:13:33.839 --> 02:13:35.941
contract right now to test any

02:13:36.007 --> 02:13:37.843
additional homes would you be

02:13:37.909 --> 02:13:38.410
able to provide the contact

02:13:38.477 --> 02:13:40.245
information for that resident

02:13:40.312 --> 02:13:42.147
to the doctor definitely I'll

02:13:42.214 --> 02:13:44.049
ask you to- do that at the an

02:13:44.116 --> 02:13:46.218
address or to follow at the

02:13:46.284 --> 02:13:48.120
last the TSC meeting one of

02:13:48.186 --> 02:13:51.957
their their DTS the employees-

02:13:52.023 --> 02:13:53.825
did admit that they do not have

02:13:53.892 --> 02:13:55.794
a current contract in place to

02:13:55.861 --> 02:13:57.963
do. Testing on those sixteen

02:13:58.029 --> 02:13:58.563
hundred that there can't they

02:13:58.630 --> 02:14:01.833
can't get in contact with and

02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:05.637
what brings it. As a community

02:14:05.704 --> 02:14:07.939
member. If they can't handle a

02:14:08.006 --> 02:14:09.975
contract like this. They don't

02:14:10.041 --> 02:14:12.210
have the experience or the know

02:14:12.277 --> 02:14:15.814
how to how to handle. A

02:14:15.881 --> 02:14:16.381
catastrophe of this of this

02:14:16.448 --> 02:14:21.753
magnitude. And I don't send I

02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:23.722
don't trust them I don't trust

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:24.356
them to make decisions that are

02:14:24.423 --> 02:14:26.057
in the best interest of the

02:14:26.124 --> 02:14:27.959
community. And I don't make

02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:30.295
trust them to make decisions

02:14:30.362 --> 02:14:31.797
that are in the interest of

02:14:31.863 --> 02:14:34.166
getting this cleaned up as

02:14:34.232 --> 02:14:37.769
expeditiously as as possible I

02:14:37.836 --> 02:14:39.905
would ask I would encourage a

02:14:39.971 --> 02:14:42.040
auditor to find out why they're

02:14:42.107 --> 02:14:44.075
having the problems with the

02:14:44.142 --> 02:14:46.211
contractors and it's this isn't

02:14:46.278 --> 02:14:46.778
the first time they've had

02:14:46.845 --> 02:14:48.213
problems with contractors they

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:50.215
obviously I'm not eight they're

02:14:50.282 --> 02:14:52.117
not able to handle that.

02:14:52.184 --> 02:14:53.985
Another question regarding the

02:14:54.052 --> 02:14:58.089
contracts is. Is American

02:14:58.156 --> 02:15:01.827
integrated services. Did they

02:15:01.893 --> 02:15:04.029
ever do work both on act on the

02:15:04.095 --> 02:15:06.164
excited facility and on the

02:15:06.231 --> 02:15:07.899
residential clean up because

02:15:07.966 --> 02:15:09.734
that's also something that I'm

02:15:09.801 --> 02:15:11.803
interested because I would

02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:12.437
think that would be a conflict

02:15:12.504 --> 02:15:14.039
of interest. That's something

02:15:14.105 --> 02:15:14.673
else that I would hope that you

02:15:14.739 --> 02:15:18.009
guys would look into. So of

02:15:18.076 --> 02:15:21.746
moving on to the most important

02:15:21.813 --> 02:15:25.851
thing to me. As in the- over

02:15:25.917 --> 02:15:26.418
six having years that we've

02:15:26.485 --> 02:15:29.988
been fighting for excited. The

02:15:30.055 --> 02:15:30.555
communities health has been

02:15:30.622 --> 02:15:34.125
impacted. There's no question

02:15:34.192 --> 02:15:36.228
about that they can say there's

02:15:36.294 --> 02:15:37.963
no way to prove this. This

02:15:38.029 --> 02:15:41.833
site- these chemicals not just

02:15:41.900 --> 02:15:44.002
lead but all the other list of

02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:44.603
toxins that they came they put

02:15:44.669 --> 02:15:46.271
out. That there's no way to

02:15:46.338 --> 02:15:48.273
prove but you can. You can

02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:52.644
prove it. Everything that they

02:15:52.711 --> 02:15:54.045
put on the list of what led an

02:15:54.112 --> 02:15:55.814
arsenic and all of those. Can

02:15:55.881 --> 02:15:58.216
can because my family has

02:15:58.283 --> 02:16:01.953
suffered. I have most of them.

02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:02.554
And there's no hope for me

02:16:02.621 --> 02:16:04.089
there is no reversing the

02:16:04.155 --> 02:16:06.024
damage that it's done to me and

02:16:06.091 --> 02:16:08.126
I'm pretty sure I will not see

02:16:08.193 --> 02:16:11.930
the end of the clean up. And

02:16:11.997 --> 02:16:13.932
what I have failed to see. Is

02:16:13.999 --> 02:16:15.934
since we started this. No

02:16:16.001 --> 02:16:18.103
monies. From the state. From

02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:22.007
the TSC from anybody. Has gone

02:16:22.073 --> 02:16:22.541
to. Help with the health

02:16:22.607 --> 02:16:28.079
impacts. We are the worst

02:16:28.146 --> 02:16:30.181
casualty of this contamination

02:16:30.248 --> 02:16:32.217
yet there is no cleanup of our

02:16:32.284 --> 02:16:34.185
human bodies there's no

02:16:34.252 --> 02:16:36.087
assistance for us when the US

02:16:36.154 --> 02:16:38.223
attorney entered is inter this

02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:39.991
agreement and decided. Whether

02:16:40.058 --> 02:16:42.060
it was because they have a

02:16:42.127 --> 02:16:44.195
government contract to recycle

02:16:44.262 --> 02:16:45.997
their batteries or not I don't

02:16:46.064 --> 02:16:47.866
know why they entered into this

02:16:47.933 --> 02:16:48.400
contract but they took our

02:16:48.466 --> 02:16:53.872
ability to see- that that. The

02:16:53.939 --> 02:16:55.874
residents are ability to sue

02:16:55.941 --> 02:16:58.043
for health damages or financial

02:16:58.109 --> 02:16:58.610
assistance to pay for their

02:16:58.677 --> 02:17:01.846
chemo their doctors bills there

02:17:01.913 --> 02:17:02.447
you know the procedures that

02:17:02.514 --> 02:17:04.182
they have to go through. So

02:17:04.249 --> 02:17:07.953
we're eating the cost of this

02:17:08.019 --> 02:17:10.121
and there is no help for us

02:17:10.188 --> 02:17:14.092
what I am asking is if you guys

02:17:14.159 --> 02:17:16.094
can find in any budget. To set

02:17:16.161 --> 02:17:16.728
up a fund you can give it to

02:17:16.795 --> 02:17:18.463
the department of health that

02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:19.864
the county health department

02:17:19.931 --> 02:17:22.033
let them set up a fund to help.

02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:26.037
People pay for their healthcare

02:17:26.104 --> 02:17:26.538
costs incurred by the

02:17:26.605 --> 02:17:30.241
contamination cost. My copay to

02:17:30.308 --> 02:17:32.110
see my oncologist is thirty

02:17:32.177 --> 02:17:34.179
five dollars every time I go

02:17:34.245 --> 02:17:34.779
see them that's not including

02:17:34.846 --> 02:17:36.147
the medications it's not

02:17:36.214 --> 02:17:38.383
including the procedures it's

02:17:38.450 --> 02:17:40.185
not calling. And I have

02:17:40.251 --> 02:17:42.020
excellent insurance. And that

02:17:42.087 --> 02:17:46.024
still. Financial financially

02:17:46.091 --> 02:17:46.591
hard on me to pay for all of

02:17:46.658 --> 02:17:50.395
that. We need something to

02:17:50.462 --> 02:17:52.263
address the hit health in the

02:17:52.330 --> 02:17:54.299
human impact. The people who

02:17:54.366 --> 02:17:57.969
department of health- referring

02:17:58.036 --> 02:17:59.971
to for manta for developmental

02:18:00.038 --> 02:18:02.107
delays and disabilities in

02:18:02.173 --> 02:18:04.142
testing is regional center. Now

02:18:04.209 --> 02:18:05.910
through my at my work life I

02:18:05.977 --> 02:18:07.979
worked with the regional

02:18:08.046 --> 02:18:08.580
different regional centers for

02:18:08.647 --> 02:18:12.083
years. East LA regional that

02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:14.219
service the area that the- that

02:18:14.286 --> 02:18:16.054
covers the impacted area. Has

02:18:16.121 --> 02:18:20.091
the most. Clients being service

02:18:20.158 --> 02:18:21.960
than any other regional center

02:18:22.027 --> 02:18:24.062
anywhere else. They're

02:18:24.129 --> 02:18:24.729
referring people there and they

02:18:24.796 --> 02:18:25.997
can't even get assessed or or

02:18:26.064 --> 02:18:28.533
even or even evaluated because

02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:30.135
they don't have the money to.

02:18:30.201 --> 02:18:32.270
So money needs to either go to

02:18:32.337 --> 02:18:36.141
the organizations that are

02:18:36.207 --> 02:18:38.076
being referred to compete were

02:18:38.143 --> 02:18:40.845
they're referring people to and

02:18:40.912 --> 02:18:42.047
a fun needs to be set up. For

02:18:42.113 --> 02:18:44.015
this and the last thing I ask

02:18:44.082 --> 02:18:46.051
for funding also. You guys can

02:18:46.117 --> 02:18:48.153
find grant or funding for. Dr

02:18:48.219 --> 02:18:50.388
Jill Johnston who did the tooth

02:18:50.455 --> 02:18:52.290
fairy project. And white

02:18:52.357 --> 02:18:54.392
memorial Medical Center doctor

02:18:54.459 --> 02:18:56.461
Brian Johnston both of them are

02:18:56.528 --> 02:19:02.133
looking into. A study. With the

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:04.102
X. Leyva X. ray fluorescence

02:19:04.169 --> 02:19:06.171
machine that will ship and

02:19:06.237 --> 02:19:07.972
measure long term exposure.

02:19:08.039 --> 02:19:10.341
Only there can a doctor truly

02:19:10.408 --> 02:19:12.477
see what you're at risk for and

02:19:12.544 --> 02:19:16.147
can understand a little bit

02:19:16.214 --> 02:19:16.748
more how it how they can treat

02:19:16.815 --> 02:19:18.550
you. We at least deserve that

02:19:18.616 --> 02:19:20.251
we at least deserves some

02:19:20.318 --> 02:19:24.255
monies going to research care

02:19:24.322 --> 02:19:26.424
and anything else that the

02:19:26.491 --> 02:19:30.128
county is incurring the cost of.

02:19:30.195 --> 02:19:32.230
Humans who were affected are

02:19:32.297 --> 02:19:36.234
going to need help for the next

02:19:36.301 --> 02:19:38.837
decade the children who were

02:19:38.903 --> 02:19:40.605
born into it now argument need

02:19:40.672 --> 02:19:42.140
helping care and services

02:19:42.207 --> 02:19:44.008
throughout their of their life

02:19:44.075 --> 02:19:46.077
not just it doesn't and the

02:19:46.144 --> 02:19:48.079
clean up is done so I'm asking

02:19:48.146 --> 02:19:48.680
that you guys take that into

02:19:48.747 --> 02:19:50.415
consideration thank you thank

02:19:50.482 --> 02:19:52.217
you for comments of step. Can

02:19:52.283 --> 02:20:04.229
steal. All right all work of

02:20:04.295 --> 02:20:06.264
read these questions so what

02:20:06.331 --> 02:20:06.798
happens when Sora was re

02:20:06.865 --> 02:20:12.103
contaminated. Ray contamination

02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:14.072
no edge has been found why and

02:20:14.139 --> 02:20:16.341
when will this move out of

02:20:16.407 --> 02:20:20.111
preliminary. Ground water was

02:20:20.178 --> 02:20:22.213
affected by hex chromium where

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:24.549
are we with this the and PA

02:20:24.616 --> 02:20:28.219
listed at us finding. Of the

02:20:28.286 --> 02:20:30.722
excite plant. No soil has been

02:20:30.789 --> 02:20:34.325
tested since June twenty

02:20:34.392 --> 02:20:36.227
nineteen ray residences. Public

02:20:36.294 --> 02:20:38.530
dissemination of materials paid

02:20:38.596 --> 02:20:40.632
by excited will expire in

02:20:40.698 --> 02:20:42.333
twenty twenty the of the anti

02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:44.435
any non prosecution agreement

02:20:44.502 --> 02:20:46.271
what happens after five year

02:20:46.337 --> 02:20:52.544
and PA sunset. The I thank you

02:20:52.610 --> 02:20:54.112
for asking those questions this

02:20:54.179 --> 02:20:54.712
is an opportunity to provide

02:20:54.779 --> 02:20:56.481
public comment but I'm sure

02:20:56.548 --> 02:20:58.516
that departments listing and

02:20:58.583 --> 02:21:00.485
taking those questions into

02:21:00.552 --> 02:21:04.222
consideration at a Martha

02:21:04.289 --> 02:21:06.257
menace did you want to add a

02:21:06.324 --> 02:21:08.126
comment to what we've already.

02:21:08.193 --> 02:21:14.566
And please. Yeah the people

02:21:14.632 --> 02:21:18.369
that strategies okay. I don't

02:21:18.436 --> 02:21:22.207
want to give that to anyone the

02:21:22.273 --> 02:21:22.807
question that I have for the

02:21:22.874 --> 02:21:24.676
officers that deal with health

02:21:24.742 --> 02:21:28.279
related issues. If we are to do

02:21:28.346 --> 02:21:30.415
blood tests are you able to

02:21:30.481 --> 02:21:34.252
tell us if five there's lead

02:21:34.319 --> 02:21:36.254
that emanated from the- source

02:21:36.321 --> 02:21:38.556
of exercise in our

02:21:38.623 --> 02:21:42.227
neighborhoods. Yeah there's

02:21:42.293 --> 02:21:42.760
been talk about that and

02:21:42.827 --> 02:21:44.495
unfortunately for blood testing

02:21:44.562 --> 02:21:46.898
no there is there are some ways

02:21:46.965 --> 02:21:48.433
in environmental testing that

02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:50.568
you can do that sort of work to

02:21:50.635 --> 02:21:52.537
try to source the kind of lead

02:21:52.604 --> 02:21:54.339
that you finding environment to

02:21:54.405 --> 02:21:54.906
the source that it may have

02:21:54.973 --> 02:21:56.708
come from. For human testing no

02:21:56.774 --> 02:21:58.376
we don't have sophisticated

02:21:58.443 --> 02:22:00.378
tests enough that will that can

02:22:00.445 --> 02:22:02.614
do that sort of- that's the can

02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:04.482
give yes that sort of result

02:22:04.549 --> 02:22:06.584
okay. And for supervisor Hilda

02:22:06.651 --> 02:22:08.753
cities so what I want to point

02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:10.722
out that this is an opportunity

02:22:10.788 --> 02:22:12.423
for public comment it's not a

02:22:12.490 --> 02:22:16.628
Q. and a- I just wanted to make

02:22:16.694 --> 02:22:18.463
a constitutional requests on

02:22:18.529 --> 02:22:20.398
behalf of my community can I do

02:22:20.465 --> 02:22:22.333
this yes you can make any

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:24.335
request you want. I wanted to

02:22:24.402 --> 02:22:26.404
our supervisor Hilda cities if

02:22:26.471 --> 02:22:28.406
five she may be able to

02:22:28.473 --> 02:22:30.341
increase the number of promote

02:22:30.408 --> 02:22:32.377
daughter since paas seven now

02:22:32.443 --> 02:22:32.844
that I know that the

02:22:32.911 --> 02:22:34.512
representative is here why

02:22:34.579 --> 02:22:38.216
because our community from city

02:22:38.283 --> 02:22:40.218
terrorists to. Burn in

02:22:40.285 --> 02:22:42.353
southeastern cities are

02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:44.455
impacted the most impact the

02:22:44.522 --> 02:22:46.224
communities for the

02:22:46.291 --> 02:22:48.326
environmental issues so I

02:22:48.393 --> 02:22:50.295
wanted to know if you may do

02:22:50.361 --> 02:22:52.297
that because those people can

02:22:52.363 --> 02:22:52.897
be our corporate people they

02:22:52.964 --> 02:22:54.465
can going to power the

02:22:54.532 --> 02:22:58.369
communities but reaching out.

02:22:58.436 --> 02:22:58.937
To them I know that the el

02:22:59.003 --> 02:23:02.340
county is looking into getting

02:23:02.407 --> 02:23:03.007
more promote taught us to other

02:23:03.074 --> 02:23:06.277
districts. By you represent my

02:23:06.344 --> 02:23:08.613
district and I have a lot of

02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:10.782
faith that you are doing a

02:23:10.848 --> 02:23:16.387
great job. One know if made the.

02:23:16.454 --> 02:23:20.224
For our community. So a if you

02:23:20.291 --> 02:23:20.825
choose to respond now if you

02:23:20.892 --> 02:23:21.426
interest later that's fine but

02:23:21.492 --> 02:23:22.560
this is not. The is public

02:23:22.627 --> 02:23:24.362
comment on on- intended to be a

02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:26.698
time when we have dialogue- all

02:23:26.764 --> 02:23:30.468
I see. And an observation can

02:23:30.535 --> 02:23:34.339
the US army corps of engineers

02:23:34.405 --> 02:23:36.541
service sign overseers. Of the

02:23:36.607 --> 02:23:38.643
exite our proper this mad. And

02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:42.180
the cleanup of the residential

02:23:42.246 --> 02:23:46.250
areas scenes they work in pump.

02:23:46.317 --> 02:23:48.619
Well the world thank you. Thank

02:23:48.686 --> 02:23:50.588
you very much- next we have

02:23:50.655 --> 02:23:54.559
Yvonne bike if I could just

02:23:54.625 --> 02:23:56.461
respond I know I'm a big

02:23:56.527 --> 02:23:57.095
advocate for the moment thought

02:23:57.161 --> 02:24:00.465
us and- I know the public

02:24:00.531 --> 02:24:02.333
health and mental health have

02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:03.001
actually in the last two budget

02:24:03.067 --> 02:24:07.005
cycles increase the number of

02:24:07.071 --> 02:24:07.638
from a thought as- but keep in

02:24:07.705 --> 02:24:08.706
mind that our budget comes from

02:24:08.773 --> 02:24:10.808
also the federal government

02:24:10.875 --> 02:24:12.643
Sacramento and because we've

02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:14.712
been so successful I think with

02:24:14.779 --> 02:24:16.514
the small army that we have.

02:24:16.581 --> 02:24:18.683
Other supervisors have picked

02:24:18.750 --> 02:24:20.618
up on that so I would say that

02:24:20.685 --> 02:24:22.587
in most cases unfortunately

02:24:22.653 --> 02:24:24.655
they divide by five but we do

02:24:24.722 --> 02:24:28.326
know that our our our county

02:24:28.393 --> 02:24:30.461
resources- I have always

02:24:30.528 --> 02:24:32.397
continue to be supportive of

02:24:32.463 --> 02:24:34.565
that and I think maybe working

02:24:34.632 --> 02:24:35.199
with the legislature that might

02:24:35.266 --> 02:24:36.801
be something that we could try

02:24:36.868 --> 02:24:38.669
to carve out funding for the

02:24:38.736 --> 02:24:40.338
state because they are affected

02:24:40.405 --> 02:24:42.440
their health care navigators-

02:24:42.507 --> 02:24:44.575
and they do- culturally

02:24:44.642 --> 02:24:46.411
competent. Of information and

02:24:46.477 --> 02:24:49.080
they help to encourage people

02:24:49.147 --> 02:24:50.615
to get tested for everything

02:24:50.681 --> 02:24:52.650
and they certainly could could

02:24:52.717 --> 02:24:54.519
be used for to working with the

02:24:54.585 --> 02:24:58.423
TSC- DTS I'm sorry do TSC to

02:24:58.489 --> 02:25:00.358
get out to the community

02:25:00.425 --> 02:25:00.958
because they're the ones that

02:25:01.025 --> 02:25:02.860
are most trusted- I don't know

02:25:02.927 --> 02:25:04.695
that our capacity maybe there's

02:25:04.762 --> 02:25:06.664
something that we could work

02:25:06.731 --> 02:25:08.800
with. With the state out on

02:25:08.866 --> 02:25:10.435
something like that as we head

02:25:10.501 --> 02:25:12.637
but again it a lot of allies on

02:25:12.703 --> 02:25:16.908
the budget but it's registered

02:25:16.974 --> 02:25:18.876
thank you. Thank you we have if

02:25:18.943 --> 02:25:22.547
March what the next and- lastly.

02:25:22.613 --> 02:25:28.586
Maximo qureia. Hi good evening

02:25:28.653 --> 02:25:29.120
my name is Martinez even

02:25:29.187 --> 02:25:30.688
Martinez Watson on the chair of

02:25:30.755 --> 02:25:32.457
the environmental justice

02:25:32.523 --> 02:25:34.792
committee for the Sierra Club

02:25:34.859 --> 02:25:36.661
Angeles chapter. And I just

02:25:36.727 --> 02:25:38.763
wanted to mention. There's a

02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:40.698
difference between conventional

02:25:40.765 --> 02:25:42.700
environmentalism environmental

02:25:42.767 --> 02:25:46.370
justice. Conventional my rental

02:25:46.437 --> 02:25:48.639
isn't is about see of like

02:25:48.706 --> 02:25:52.543
cannibals places. Both types

02:25:52.610 --> 02:25:54.345
of- issues environmental

02:25:54.412 --> 02:25:56.447
justice is about social justice

02:25:56.514 --> 02:25:57.081
it is about getting justice for

02:25:57.148 --> 02:25:58.916
people. And the focus is on

02:25:58.983 --> 02:26:02.653
people. And that is what's

02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:04.689
happening here we have a

02:26:04.755 --> 02:26:06.524
situation where the people are

02:26:06.591 --> 02:26:08.759
being affected by their

02:26:08.826 --> 02:26:10.895
environment. And it is really

02:26:10.962 --> 02:26:12.864
unfair for these people to be

02:26:12.930 --> 02:26:14.899
having to wait so long to get

02:26:14.966 --> 02:26:18.469
justice. Because of the social

02:26:18.536 --> 02:26:20.571
justice movement we say justice

02:26:20.638 --> 02:26:24.475
delayed is justice denied. And

02:26:24.542 --> 02:26:25.109
for the people here who have

02:26:25.176 --> 02:26:28.379
children who were five years

02:26:28.446 --> 02:26:28.980
old way back when this whole

02:26:29.046 --> 02:26:30.882
thing started. And the DTS he

02:26:30.948 --> 02:26:32.984
determined that they were going

02:26:33.050 --> 02:26:34.719
to start with the houses that

02:26:34.785 --> 02:26:36.654
were the most impact it had the

02:26:36.721 --> 02:26:38.689
highest levels of lead. Had a

02:26:38.756 --> 02:26:40.758
pregnant woman present or five

02:26:40.825 --> 02:26:41.392
year old child or any of these

02:26:41.459 --> 02:26:44.695
other conditions well we are

02:26:44.762 --> 02:26:46.964
way past that. In terms of the

02:26:47.031 --> 02:26:48.933
future. And that means that

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.002
those people who were back

02:26:51.068 --> 02:26:54.772
then. At most risk. For the

02:26:54.839 --> 02:26:56.807
adverse effects of lead have

02:26:56.874 --> 02:27:00.645
had two indoor it way past the

02:27:00.711 --> 02:27:02.780
time that they were determined

02:27:02.847 --> 02:27:04.649
they needed to help the most.

02:27:04.715 --> 02:27:06.918
So that is not acceptable.

02:27:06.984 --> 02:27:08.886
Environmental justice was based

02:27:08.953 --> 02:27:11.022
on the concept of environmental

02:27:11.088 --> 02:27:15.059
racism. And in this case if

02:27:15.126 --> 02:27:16.861
this were a situation happening

02:27:16.928 --> 02:27:20.464
in another part of Los Angeles

02:27:20.531 --> 02:27:22.466
I guarantee you those people

02:27:22.533 --> 02:27:23.100
would have been all over your

02:27:23.167 --> 02:27:24.969
cases by now this would not

02:27:25.036 --> 02:27:26.671
have been allowed to continue

02:27:26.737 --> 02:27:30.975
this long. Something needs to

02:27:31.042 --> 02:27:34.579
be done for these people it

02:27:34.645 --> 02:27:35.213
needs to be done as quickly as

02:27:35.279 --> 02:27:36.981
possible. And it needs to be

02:27:37.048 --> 02:27:39.083
done for the people in addition

02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:42.787
to their properties. They need

02:27:42.853 --> 02:27:44.789
to get some sort of either

02:27:44.855 --> 02:27:46.791
compensation or some kind of

02:27:46.857 --> 02:27:47.325
assistance with the health

02:27:47.391 --> 02:27:48.993
issues that they're going to be

02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:53.698
facing because let there is no.

02:27:53.764 --> 02:27:56.968
Safe level of lead in your body

02:27:57.034 --> 02:27:59.103
none. These people are going to

02:27:59.170 --> 02:27:59.737
be dealing with the site these

02:27:59.804 --> 02:28:01.038
effects for years for the rest

02:28:01.105 --> 02:28:04.875
of their lives. They're already

02:28:04.942 --> 02:28:06.744
dealing with the now. If this

02:28:06.811 --> 02:28:10.681
had been a communicable disease

02:28:10.748 --> 02:28:11.249
such as the one that we're

02:28:11.315 --> 02:28:11.782
facing right now from the

02:28:11.849 --> 02:28:14.785
corona virus. This one tire

02:28:14.852 --> 02:28:15.319
area would have been under

02:28:15.386 --> 02:28:19.023
quarantine. And I guarantee you

02:28:19.090 --> 02:28:20.791
health department they would

02:28:20.858 --> 02:28:22.760
have gone house by house

02:28:22.827 --> 02:28:24.962
quarantine everybody. And

02:28:25.029 --> 02:28:26.797
making sure that everybody was

02:28:26.864 --> 02:28:27.398
covered there would have been

02:28:27.465 --> 02:28:30.735
no gaps. There would have been

02:28:30.801 --> 02:28:33.304
no properties well you're not

02:28:33.371 --> 02:28:35.172
as bad as your neighbor. That's

02:28:35.239 --> 02:28:38.776
ridiculous is ridiculous I

02:28:38.843 --> 02:28:40.811
heard in this week that there's

02:28:40.878 --> 02:28:42.947
a property owner who is

02:28:43.014 --> 02:28:45.082
surrounded. Buy properties that

02:28:45.149 --> 02:28:47.318
were cleaned up. But because

02:28:47.385 --> 02:28:50.588
her whole is in the next tier

02:28:50.655 --> 02:28:52.757
contamination she still waiting.

02:28:52.823 --> 02:28:55.126
How can you possibly say the

02:28:55.192 --> 02:28:57.395
her house is somehow we more

02:28:57.461 --> 02:28:58.963
immune than the house around

02:28:59.030 --> 02:29:06.837
her. What's going on. No means

02:29:06.904 --> 02:29:08.973
what the world is going to

02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:10.808
happen to all those people

02:29:10.875 --> 02:29:12.943
almost property owners who are

02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:15.112
in that next level of

02:29:15.179 --> 02:29:16.914
contamination. If we don't have

02:29:16.981 --> 02:29:18.716
enough money right now it

02:29:18.783 --> 02:29:20.951
resources to handle the people

02:29:21.018 --> 02:29:22.787
that were the most contaminated.

02:29:22.853 --> 02:29:23.321
Are we just gonna say well

02:29:23.387 --> 02:29:27.091

contaminated we don't have the

02:29:29.994 --> 02:29:32.863
money for it. I'm telling you

02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:37.034
this is not home. These people

02:29:37.101 --> 02:29:38.969

to be done in a better way it

02:32:32.877 --> 02:32:33.410
needed it should have been

02:32:33.477 --> 02:32:35.145
rolled out in it in a different

02:32:35.212 --> 02:32:37.314
way. I have many neighbors who

02:32:37.381 --> 02:32:39.283
come to me who said I'm not

02:32:39.350 --> 02:32:41.185
satisfied with the way this is

02:32:41.252 --> 02:32:43.320

02:32:43.387 --> 02:32:45.122
list when you cook at the

02:32:45.189 --> 02:32:47.024
necessary to look at both okay

02:32:47.091 --> 02:32:47.591
Mosul the main thing. It is

02:32:47.658 --> 02:32:51.028
very necessary that we all work

02:32:51.095 --> 02:32:53.264
United together. It will be in

02:32:53.330 --> 02:32:55.132
a circle deals with the one of

02:32:55.199 --> 02:32:57.001
the system better known as

02:32:57.067 --> 02:32:59.136
political the US going like

02:32:59.203 --> 02:33:02.873

everybody talk to everyone but

02:33:09.246 --> 02:33:09.680
they're really not being

02:33:09.747 --> 02:33:13.150
responsive to what needs to be

02:33:13.217 --> 02:33:13.751
done and how the work needs to

02:33:13.817 --> 02:33:16.921
be. This is just an opera

02:33:16.987 --> 02:33:18.923
hometown log on and also low.

02:33:18.989 --> 02:33:19.557
But I get much I can't pay it

02:33:19.623 --> 02:33:21.358
that they like when you that.

02:33:21.425 --> 02:33:23.260
As political support this to me

02:33:23.327 --> 02:33:25.062
at least get them to put in the

02:33:25.129 --> 02:33:25.729
how about if the next time you

02:33:25.796 --> 02:33:27.031
have one of these meetings

02:33:27.097 --> 02:33:28.999
during a much bigger place. How

02:33:29.066 --> 02:33:31.135
real outrage we're community

02:33:31.201 --> 02:33:31.735
members who are going through

02:33:31.802 --> 02:33:33.504
this can actually come and stay

02:33:33.571 --> 02:33:35.272
with you their stories. But

02:33:35.339 --> 02:33:37.408
open it limited to the fullest

02:33:37.474 --> 02:33:39.276
assembly the company local like

02:33:39.343 --> 02:33:41.245
when you that needs done most.

02:33:41.312 --> 02:33:43.047
Democrats voted any settlement

02:33:43.113 --> 02:33:45.049
that could rest of total it up

02:33:45.115 --> 02:33:45.683
at the numbers went up when is

02:33:45.749 --> 02:33:47.151
it going published the project

02:33:47.217 --> 02:33:53.123
the that if the after. All

02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:53.691

02:33:57.094 --> 02:33:57.595
will do back. To really. To

02:33:57.661 --> 02:33:59.229
what we are saying it. Together

02:33:59.296 --> 02:34:01.031
and work and coordinating this.

02:34:01.098 --> 02:34:03.434
Correctly to the we can clean

02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:05.336
our- unity. See if them in the

02:34:05.402 --> 02:34:08.939
US okay- up really Jacqui this

02:34:09.006 --> 02:34:09.573
is to some of the some please

02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:13.243
take a look- but I. But I guess

02:34:13.310 --> 02:34:15.112
so. But I'd low not printed on

02:34:15.179 --> 02:34:15.746
your conduct testing in though.

02:34:15.813 --> 02:34:17.348
But then I don't put as he they

02:34:17.414 --> 02:34:19.083
think of him as possible so

02:34:19.149 --> 02:34:19.683
what I'm asking the minister

02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:21.251
unless you're done you're going

02:34:21.318 --> 02:34:21.819
to focus on that the little

02:34:21.885 --> 02:34:23.220
also see that. You know

02:34:23.287 --> 02:34:25.055
although as far as to say that

02:34:25.122 --> 02:34:27.057
maybe these assembly men and

02:34:27.124 --> 02:34:28.926
women. Can goal one further.

02:34:28.993 --> 02:34:29.560
And do something about Donald

02:34:29.627 --> 02:34:33.163
Trump. And what he's doing. To

02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:39.269
respond to the issue. That

02:34:39.336 --> 02:34:41.071
we're going there right now. I

02:34:41.138 --> 02:34:41.672
in up I mean dollar con. You

02:34:41.739 --> 02:34:43.374
okay stumble so in the course

02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:45.175
of my I mean if assume. He's

02:34:45.242 --> 02:34:47.344
this and then the- only gonna.

02:34:47.411 --> 02:34:49.079
Because most of in the- lower

02:34:49.146 --> 02:34:51.181
by use. His horrible

02:34:51.248 --> 02:34:51.882
understanding of the earth warm.

02:34:51.949 --> 02:34:53.417
And climate change is really

02:34:53.484 --> 02:34:55.552
the basis for a lot of what's

02:34:55.619 --> 02:34:57.254
going on he's misunderstanding

02:34:57.321 --> 02:35:01.291
is causing. A lot of issues in

02:35:01.358 --> 02:35:01.892
my community. It will be Hogan

02:35:01.959 --> 02:35:03.527
road that is a second at the

02:35:03.594 --> 02:35:05.562
look at I'm a sucker could be

02:35:05.629 --> 02:35:07.097
the most and let the other.

02:35:07.164 --> 02:35:09.099
Thing is some of what they get

02:35:09.166 --> 02:35:09.733
yeah but but as soon but it you

02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:11.435
know. Now let's get it but they

02:35:11.502 --> 02:35:13.037
can't miss the most what

02:35:13.103 --> 02:35:13.637
president of apple also see

02:35:13.704 --> 02:35:15.506
