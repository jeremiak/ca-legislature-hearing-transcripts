ONE HUNDRED THE SECOND TIME THAT IT'S BEEN IN OUR COMMITTEE -- WE APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK ON THIS. VERY IMPORTANT. ISSUE. AND WE TURN TO YOU THIS AS A A DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE FLOOR. OF THE ASSEMBLY. THAT'S THE MOTION THAT -- WE'RE RECOMMENING. YOU HAVE THE FLOOR IS YOURS MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING AND SAID TO FIND STAFF WE WORKED A VERY DILIGENTLY AS YOU HAVE STATED THAT JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO. ONE OF THE GIVEN MUCH FOR YOUR TIME FOR INVESTMENTS -- AND THE VIA THE EXPERIENCE OF A OF YOUR STUFF TO WHO HAVE HELPED ADJOURNMENTS THE SHAPE OF A SP ONE HUNDRED SO THIS IS A FROM BOTH HOUSES WITH THAT THE EXPERTISE ON ON BOTH SIDES. MISTER CHAIRMAN SO VICE CHAIR NOW ONE OF THE RIVER MUCH FOR ADAPTING TO PRESENT SENATE BILL. ONE HUNDRED SENATE BILL ONE HUNDRED PUTS CALIFORNIA ON THE PATH 21100% CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY BY THE YEAR. TWENTY FORTY FIVE IT IS THE MOST AMBITIOUS TARGETS IN THE WORLD FOR AN ECONOMY THAT DWARFS ALL BUT A HANDFUL OF NATIONS. BUT OUR EXPERIENCE SO FAR OFFERS HARD EVIDENCE VERY HARD EVIDENCE THAT WE CAN DRAMATICALLY EXPAND CLEAN ENERGY WHILE ALSO GROWING OUR ECONOMY AND PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK. IN FACT CLEAN ENERGY IS AN EXTRAORDINARY ECONOMIC SUCCESS STORY IN CALIFORNIA. SOLAR WIND ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND OTHER CLEAN POWER SOURCES NOW COLLECTIVELY EMPLOY OVER HALF A MILLION [inaudible] OF CALIFORNIANS. IN FACT THERE ARE MORE THAN NEARLY TEN TIMES MORE CLEAN ENERGY JOBS IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. THAN THEY ARE COAL MINING JOBS IN ALL OF AMERICA. AND THE INDUSTRY IS GROWING ADDING JOBS FASTER THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER SECTOR. THIS EXPLOSIVE GROWTH HAS BEEN SPURRED IN LARGE PART BY CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS CLIMATE POLICIES. CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF OUR PROGRESS. CLEAN ENERGY IS NOW A POLLUTER OF OUR ECONOMY AND IT IS HERE TO STAY. BUT THE INDUSTRY IS NOT CREATING JUST ANY OLD JOBS IT'S CREATING JOBS THAT SUPPORT THE MIDDLE CLASS. FAMILIES MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES IN IS DOING SO AND SO ARE MOST IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES. IN CREATING REAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIANS OF EVERY CAL EVERY BACKGROUND IN SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE. AND DESPITE THE DOOMSDAY RHETORIC WE HEARD FROM THE WE HAVE HEARD WHEN WE PASS OUR CURRENT RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD. THIS IS BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY. JUST TWENTY YEARS AGO WE WERE 0% OR PS WE'VE GONE FROM 00220%. PERCENT. SOME OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE ALMOST AT 50% TODAY BECAUSE THE MARKET SIGNALS SENT VERY CLEARLY TO SENATE BILL. THREE FIFTY NOW WE WANT TO HAVE TO ESTABLISH A PATHWAY FROM FLEXIBILITY AND A LONG. A WINDOW INTO THE FUTURE. CALIFORNIANS SPEND LESS ON THE UTILITY BILLS AND RESIDENTS OF ALL BUT THREE STATES AND DC. SENATE BILL ONE HUNDRED EXHORTS ARE TRANSITION 21100% CARBON FREE. SPEEDS UP SENATE BILL THREE FIFTIES A 50% MANDATE FOR CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY. TWENTY THIRTY TO TWENTY TWENTY IT ESTABLISHES A NEW BENCHMARK UP 60% BY THE YEAR. TWENTY THIRTY IT WILL HELP US CAPTURE UNCONTROLLED METHANE EMISSIONS FROM JERRY'S FROM LANDFILLS AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS REPLACE NATURAL GAS FROM FRACKING. VERY MIND THIS IS METHANE THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING FLARED OR ESCAPING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND WARMING THE PLANET. POUND FOR POUND HAS MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS VERY KNOW VERY WELL IT'S MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN CARBON DIOXIDE IT'S A SUPER TOXIC POLLUTANTS. THIS BILL CREATES A POLICY FRAMEWORK TO CAPTURE IT AND USE IT TO HELP REPLACE DIESEL ENGINES AND HEAVY TRUCKS AND MACHINERY. IT AUTHORIZES OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS AND CLEANER TRANSPORTATION FUELS LIKE HYDROGEN OR WES WASTE NOTHING. MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS A LANDMARK PROPOSAL. BUT ALSO MEASURED. IT'S A MEASURED APPROACH THAT ENSURES WE HAVE FLEXIBLE AND RELIABLE GRIT. NOW BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE PRIVATELY OWNED INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AS WELL AS THE MUNICIPAL A UTILITIES TO FIX AS MANY OF THE CONCERNS AS POSSIBLE. HAVE BEEN WORKING IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH THESE GROUPS TO MEND THE BILL AND FIND AGREEMENT THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. WITH WORKING WITH OUR CHAIRMAN HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY SIMILAR -- GOALS ON THE ISSUE OF ENERGY CLEAN ENERGY IN THE WILL DO SO OVER THE SUMMER BREAK. ONE OF THOSE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMEDIAN ELSE'S SECTION FIVE A BOTTOM OF PAGE THREE WAS DESIGNED TO AVOID DIS INCENTIVIZING AYE YOU USE AND PEEL USE FROM CONVERTING. A BUILDINGS IMPORTS FROM FOSSIL FUELS TO ELECTRICITY. AS NOTED CORRECTLY IN THE ANALYSIS THAT AMENDMENT WAS NOT AS CLEARLY DRAFTED AT THE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND AS A RESULT HAS CREATED SOME CONTROVERSY NO DOUBT. IN DO INTO AND INTRUSIVE REDUCING THAT CONTROVERSY AT THIS JUNCTURE I LIKE TO GO WITH THE CHAIRS PERMISSION TO OFFER AND AUTHORS AMENDMENT TO REMOVE THAT AMENDMENTS. BY DELETING SECTION TWO OF THIS BILL. HOWEVER THAT BEING SAID A MISTER CHAIR THAT I PLAN TO CONTINUE TO KEEP WORKING ON THAT ISSUE WITH THE P. O. USE PACIFIC LEAD THE MUNIS -- BUT WILL DO SO ARE SEPARATE FROM THIS MEASURE. WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE PROCESS -- AND HOW WE WORK WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND MAKE SURE WE GET THIS RIGHT WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR -- MISTER VICE CHAIR I AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR YOUR DUE DILIGENCE AND FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAY VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR A LET ME JUST MAKE SURE THAT AND I WERE AS YOU DESCRIBE THE AUTHORS AMENDMENT IT WOULD BE IN LIEU OF AMENDMENT NUMBER FIVE A STRIKE SECTION TWO IN THE BILL IN ITS ENTIRETY. THAT WOULD BE PAGE FOUR LINE. SIXTEEN TO TWENTY THREE AND ON PAGE FIVE LINES. ONE TO TWENTY I'M GOING TO FOLLOW YOUR LEAD ON THAT -- BIG I DON'T HAVE THE BILL IN FRONT OF ME WHEN I'M GONNA FOLLOW IT AS IT IS SAYING THAT AS THE HEARING CONTINUES YOU CAN JUST REFLECT ON IT AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S YOU ARE CORRECT YOUR QUICKNESS A CHAIR. OF WILL HEAR YOUR FIRST WITNESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RECESS ARE DEALS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BILLION CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL -- AS YOU KNOW IN THIS COMMITTEE NOTES ARE MEMBERS ARE BUILDING RENEWABLE ENERGY POWER PLANTS OF SOLAR WIND GEOTHERMAL AND THE RAPTURE FITS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCIES CREATED THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS. IN ADDITION TO THE CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY BENEFITS PREVIOUS PROGRAMS. COUNTLESS JOB BENEFITS HAVE BEEN EXTENDED TO SOME OF THE MOST IMPOVERISHED REGIONS OF OUR STATE. AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE ECONOMIC DIVERSITY BUT BECAUSE OF THESE SOLAR PLANTS AND RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS. A LOT OF KIDS FROM THOSE LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN NOW EARNING DECENT WAGES. WITH ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND PENSION BENEFITS AS WELL. THESE KIDS ACTUALLY MAY NOT HAVE HAD OTHER OPPORTUNITIES BUT THESE ARE ENTRY LEVEL JOBS WHERE DALY TRISH AND AN OPERATING ENGINEER AN IRON WORKER. COUNTLESS OTHER TRAITS LIKE SAP THEM PUT THEM ON RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS AND THEN THEY'RE BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE REST OF THE STATE HOSPITALS BRIDGES. OUGHT TO NAME A FEW. ON THE BUILDING TRADES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING COMMUNITY BENEFIT AGREEMENTS ON SEVENTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT NINETEEN MILLION HOURS OF CONSTRUCTION FOR BUILDING TRADES WORKERS CALIFORNIA JOBS. INVESTING IN CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES IN AREAS THAT PERHAPS THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE GROWTH BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS AND SO THESE ARE OPPORTUNITIES I CREATE. GREAT DEVELOPMENT. AND THESE ARE NOT ONLY FOR JOURNEY PERSON SIR FOR APPRENTICES AS WELL AND WITH ACCESS TO MIDDLE CLASS CAREERS. BUT THE CURRENT TARGETS FOR THE RP ES ARE ARE MATT -- THEY'RE BASICALLY HITTING THEIR TARGET. WE COULD OBTAIN HIGHER WE BELIEVE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STRONGLY SUPPORTING SP -- ONE HUNDRED WERE ALREADY SEEING CONSTRUCTION SLOWED DOWN BECAUSE MAJOR UTILITIES ALREADY HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO MEET THE 50%. TO KEEP PEOPLE WORKING HELP MEET OUR TWENTY THIRTY CLIMATE GOALS WE SHOULD INCREASE THE TWENTY THIRTY TARGET 260%. THE INDUSTRY IS READY AND WAITING THE WORKFORCE IS READY AND WAITING AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE AT YOUR SPORT. GOOD MORNING AND NOT TOUGH WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. AND I KNOW HE AND HERE WITH A A VERY BROAD COALITION OF COMMUNITY FAITH BASED GROUPS -- LABOR OF PARTNERS BUSINESS AND HEALTH OF GROUPS TO SUPPORT SB ONE HUNDRED HERB JUST BEFORE THE HEARING WE DELIVERED OVER -- THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND NAMES AND PETITIONS FROM EVERY SINGLE DISTRICT IN THE STATE AND RTC ALONE HAD OVER SEVEN THOUSAND OF OUR MEMBERS AND ACTIVISTS CONTACT. EVERY LEGISLATOR IN IN SAY TO TO SUPPORT SP. ONE HUNDRED BECAUSE A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE IS REALLY FOUNDATIONAL TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. I IT IT'S VERY I JUST WANT TO REFLECT ON OF THE CONSENSUS THAT HAS EMERGED AROUND. THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING CLEAN ENERGY AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS THAT THAT BRINGS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I'M ALWAYS BEEN VERY BULLISH ON CALIFORNIA AND WE CANNOT CERTAINLY CANNOT LET THE STATE OF HAWAII BEAT US -- WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER THEIR CLEAN ENERGY TARGETS IN CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY BEEN -- MEETING ARE CLEAN ENERGY TARGETS ESSAYS ARE SAID AND WE CAN DO BETTER AND WE ARE ON TRACK AND I WE ARE QUITE CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THESE AMBITIOUS TARGETS. AND IT HELPS PROVIDE MARKET CERTAINTY WHEN THE WHEN THESE TARGETS ARE IN PLACE AND AS YOU KNOW. THE CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY TARGETS ARE GONNA TAKE EVERY TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO MEET. AND IT'S A COMBINATION OF INCENTIVES REGULATIONS TARGETS AND OTHERS THAT ARE ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN MEET THESE. TARDY'S I ARE AMBITIOUS GOALS BECAUSE AS WE SEE ALL MY EYES ARE RECUPERATING RIGHT NOW FROM HAVING DRIVEN JUST DRIVEN THROUGH THE FIRE I MUST SAY -- AND THE MOST RECENT A SCIENTIFIC REPORTS YOU KNOW THAT POLLS ARE MELTING FASTER THAN WE THOUGHT THEY THEN THE SCIENTISTS PREDICTED THEY WOULD SO WE DON'T HAVE. AND ANY TIME TO LOSE ON THIS AND THE WAY THINGS ARE RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA AND WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS STATES IS REALLY WHERE THE ACTION IS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING HELP. FROM. BACK EAST AT THIS POINT AND THE CAPITAL SO I WANTED TO JUST REALLY REAFFIRMED. THE STRONG -- CONSENSUS THAT EXISTS TO THE OUTPUT THESE TARGETS IN PLACE AND TO MOVE CALIFORNIA CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE ND URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON SP ONE HUNDRED THANK YOU. OKAY Y.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MERCED MANNING ON BEHALF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER IN SUPPORT. IN THE BOTTOM HALF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC POWER AUTHORITY BY ALL VERGE A CONCERNS ARE NOT YET BEEN ADDRESSED WE LOOK FOR DIRECT THE OFF OFFICE YOU. A THANK YOU TO ALL OF THOSE WHO'VE SPOKEN OUT AND GIVING US YOUR YOUR SUPPORTED POSITIONS NOW WE WILL. RECEIVE THE COMMITTEE WILL HEAR FROM. ANYONE WHO'S HERE AS A WITNESS. TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO SB ONE MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS LEAH SILVERTHORNE WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. CAL CHAMBER OPPOSES SP ONE HUNDRED BECAUSE IT CREATES UNCERTAINTY FOR BUSINESSES IN THE STATE AND DOES THREATEN TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE ENERGY COSTS BY CREATING AN AMBIGUOUS ZERO CARBON POLICY. THAT INTERFERES WITH ONGOING INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING JUST IMPLEMENTED JUST A FEW YEARS. CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS ALREADY PAY AMONG THE HIGHEST PER KILOWATT HOURS IN THE NATION. CALIFORNIA INDUSTRIAL RATE PLATE PAYERS PAY A PREMIUM OF 68% OVER THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FARMING IN FOOD PRINT PROCESSING COMPANIES ALSO PAY A SIMILAR PROGRAM. EVERY TIME A NEW ENERGY SCHEME IS PUT INTO PLACE THESE PREMIUMS DO INCREASE THREATENING GOOD PAYING JOBS THREATEN GOOD PAYING INDUSTRIAL COMMERCIAL JOBS ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS ACROSS THE STATE. WELL THIS ME FEEL LIKE INCREMENTAL CHANGE AT SOME POINT THREE DOT ENSURE A THOUGHTFUL MEASURED AND FLEXIBLE APPROACH TO MEDIA CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS WE WILL REACH A TIPPING POINT. PUSHING OUT CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND THOSE GOOD PAYING JOBS TO OTHER STATES. IT'S NOT REALISTIC TO BELIEVE THAT GREEN ENERGY JOBS CAN REPLACE ALL INDUSTRIAL MIDDLE CLASS JOBS ACROSS ALL SECTORS ACROSS ALL THE STATE. THE INCREMENTAL COST INCREASE ALONE FROM THIS ADDITIONAL RPF SCHOOL IS ESTIMATED TO COST THE STATE AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ADDITIONAL LOSS OF PROPERTY TAX INCOME FROM. SHUTTING DOWN EVENTUAL NATURAL GAS FACILITIES OWNED BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHICH ARE USED TO FUND. BASIC RESOURCES SUCH AS POLICE AND FIRE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. THIS LEGISLATURE WISELY ENACTED MEASURED LAWS SUCH AS A. B. THE NINETY EIGHT WHICH DID ALLOW FOR INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING AND WELL DESIGNED CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS. THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY. ENERGY PRODUCERS HAVE RESPONDED IN A MEETING THOSE GOALS. THROWING AMIRI ADDED NEW PROCUREMENT MANDATES INCREASE OUR PS GOALS AND ACCELERATED TIME LINES AMIR TWO YEARS LATER THROWS A WRENCH IN THAT PROCESS. IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR LONG TERM PLANNING NECESSARY BRING ONLINE NEW TECHNOLOGY. ENSURE GREATER RELIABILITY AND KEEP READ RATES AT A LEVEL THAT CAN ST STE CONTINUE GROW FOR CALIFORNIANS ACROSS DIFFERENT SECTORS. THIS BILL IS SIMPLY PREMATURE LET'S ALLOW THE PROCESS STARTED UNDER S. B. THIRTY TWO IN EACH THREE NINETY EIGHT CONTINUE AND EVALUATE THE MILESTONES AS HE REACHED OUT. FOR THESE REASONS CAL CHAMBER WOULD ASK FOR A NOTE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VALERIE TRAIL OF LAJOS SPECIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY -- RESPECTFULLY -- OPPOSE I'M S. B.. ONE HUNDRED P. GENE -- IS VERY COMMITTED [inaudible] TO WE SUPPORTED S. B. -- THREE FIFTY SUPPORTED -- CALIFORNIA'S GOAL TO GET 240% REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GASES BY TWENTY AT THIRTY AS WE SAID LAST YEAR -- WE CAN SUPPORT. AND WE SAID MULTIPLE TIMES ON IN THE SPELL WE CAN SUPPORT TO ADD THE 60% ACCELERATION -- OF OF OUR PS -- TO TWENTY THIRTY IF THOSE AS LONG AS ALL THE PROGRAM RULES STATE STAY IN PLACE THAT WE SO HEAVILY DEBATED IN. S. B. [inaudible] THREE FIFTY ON HOWEVER. MOVING BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY RPG DETAILS AT THIS BILL DOES NOT PROPERLY PROTECT CUSTOMERS FROM ON HIGH COSTS -- THE BILL DOES NOT DEFINE AND REASONABLE OR OR ADD WHAT I DO UNREASONABLE BILL A RATE IMPACT WOULD BE. ON AND WE DON'T SEE A PROPER PROTECTION WHERE POST. TWENTY THIRTY ABOUT WHAT WE'D RATHER SEE IS A LOOK AT ALL SECTORS WITH THEIR COSTS OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS ARE PER TON AND LOOK AT IT COMPARED TO WHAT THE ELECTRIC SECTORS BEING ASKED -- TO IT COULD BE ASTARTE SHOULDER UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK -- FURTHERMORE -- AS WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME IN THIS COMMITTEE THE CURRENT. POWER CHARGING DIFFERENT ADJUSTMENT STILL HAS YET TO BE REFORMED AND WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM ARE REGULATED THE PC IS THAT AS THE CUST CUSTOMERS ARE DEPARTING OUR LOAD -- THOSE DEPARTING CUSTOMERS ARE PAYING ABOUT SIXTY SEVEN CENTS ON THE DOLLAR AND THAT STILL YET ON TV OUTPERFORMED. THERE IS THEIR LACK -- EQUAL PROTECTION OF OF ALL CUSTOMERS IN THIS BILL IN THE FORM OF EQUAL RULES FOR ALL OF THE VOTES SERVING WE HAVE A GROWING FRAGMENTED. MARKET THIS IS SOMETHING A PRINCIPLE THAT P. JEANNIE ADAM AND THE AND THE OTHER YOU -- TO I'LL USE A FAST -- FOR FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS OVER A DECADE AND RIGHT NOW THE WAY WE READ THE LANGUAGE IT SIMPLY INSURES THAT CAR DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO CHANGE. OUR PS RULES -- WHICH IS A FINE AMENDMENT BUT DOESN'T HAVE EQUAL PROTECTION -- ARE EQUAL ON RULES AND FOR ALL THAT SERVING IT TO TEASE UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK -- FINALLY I GUESS I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER A A VERY UNCERTAIN REGULATORY LEGAL FRAME LEGAL TYING UP BUT BEING FACED BY THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND BY THIS I MEAN THE NEW NORMAL THAT WERE UNDER -- WE HAVE A AND THIS IS THE WILDFIRE ISSUE. RIGHT NOW -- THE ELECTRIC AT THAT THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES -- ARE PLAGUED BY REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY IT'S CHALLENGING TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE UTILITIES. DRIVING UP THE COST OF CAPITAL IN HER WILL RESULT IN HIGHER CUSTOMER BILLS -- BESIDES THAT UNCERTAINTY WE HAD A JOINT HEARING YESTERDAY WHERE WE HEARD ABOUT OTHER CHALLENGES IF WE PEEL BACK. THE CURTAIN AND SEE WHAT THE ELECTRICITY MARKET FACES IN TERMS OF RESOURCE ADEQUACY -- UNSPECIFIED RESOURCES HOW ARE WE GONNA TRACK ARE GREENHOUSE GASES WE HAVE A LOT TO GET IN ORDER. AND PGD FEELS THAT WE SHOULD. TAKE A MOMENT TO PAUSE -- RECONCILE THESE POLICY UNCERTAINTIES BEFORE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. AND WITH THAT WOULD HELP US FOR NO VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MICHAEL POKER DORO ON BEHALF OF THE AGRICULTURAL ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION TO REPRESENT THE STATE'S. LEADING FARMING OPERATIONS A NUMBER OF FOOD PROCESSORS AND AG WATER AGENCIES. I'M I JUST WANNA SUMMARIZE WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THE FIRST TWO WITNESSES I THINK WHAT YOU HEARD WAS LAUDABLE GOAL. NOT NOW. AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE NOT NOW CLEARLY SINCE OUR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD AND ARE CLIMATE POLICY PROGRAMS. HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ELECTRIC RATES. UP FOR AGRICULTURE LIKE THE MANUFACTURING COMMERCIAL SECTORS WERE PAYING FAR MORE THAN OUR COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER STATES IN OUR COMPETITION VOTE NATIONALLY. AND INTERNATIONALLY MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO CONTINUE ON DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE -- THAT'S GETTING LAYERED ON IN LAYERED ON AND LAYERED ON BY ALL THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS RENEWABLE ENERGIES OF LAUDABLE GOAL FARMERS ARE IMPLEMENTING RENEWABLE ENERGY ON THEIR FARMS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WE'RE SEEING SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SOLAR. AYE ENERGY INSTALLATIONS ON VOTE DAIRIES AND FARMING OPERATIONS IN THE STATE BUT WE DO NEED TO TAKE A PAUSE AND TAKE A TIME OUT THE WILDFIRE ISSUE IN AND OF ITSELF IT'S GOING TO REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT RATE INCREASES FOR CUSTOMERS AS PJ NAY SEEKS TO I KERATITIS. THE LIABILITY FROM LAST YEAR'S FIRES THAT ALONE COULD ADD AS MUCH TO THE PENNY A KILOWATT HOUR TWO ELECTRIC RATES FOR LARGE. BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN THE STATE. WE NEED TO BE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT GOING FORWARD WE'RE GONNA NEED TO HARDEN OUR SYSTEM TO PREVENT. FORCE FIRES THAT'S GONNA COME AT SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS TO RATEPAYERS IN THE STATE -- IF WE LOOK TO THE GAS SECTOR OF THOSE RATE INCREASES HAVE BEEN AND PGD SERVICE TERRITORY AND THE GAS COMPANY -- IT AS A RESULT OF RELEASE OF CANYON SO THERE'S A LOT MORE RATE INCREASES COMING FOR IMPLEMENTING STORAGE MANDATES WE'VE GOT PENDING LEGISLATION. TO DOUBLE THAT STORAGE MANDATE THAT STORAGE COMES AT SIGNIFICANT COST. THE CPUC JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO -- BUT APPROVED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ROUGHLY OF ELECTRICAL BE VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ALL GETS RATE BASED IT ADDS TO CONSUMER COSTS IT'S PART OF OUR CLIMB POLICIES IN THE STATE. SO WHERE TO A CRITICAL POINT IF THIS. CONTINUES -- TO MANDATE AFTER MANDATE CONTINUES TO ADD THAT THESE COSTS WE'RE GOING TO START LOSING BUSINESSES I RECOGNIZE JOBS CAN BE CREATED BY SOLAR DEVELOPMENT. WONDERFUL BUT YOU NEED TO START CALCULATING THE JOBS THAT ARE GOING TO BE LOST IN THIS STATE. AS WE CONTINUE THIS INCREASING PUSH. TOWARDS ADDITIONAL MANDATES. WE'RE DOING GREAT IN THE STATE. THIS BILL IS NOT NEEDED AT THIS TIME AND WE NEED TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO STEP BACK. IT'S NOT JUST THE UNCERTAINTY OF WILD FIRES WHO SERVING WHO AND I THINK THE OTHER BIG THEME IN YESTERDAY'S. HEARING WAS -- YOU'VE GOT A COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION GOT DIRECT ACCESS AND LOAD SERVING ENTITIES YOU GOT THE ABILITIES. WHOSE PROCURING FOR WHOM AT THIS POINT WE NEED TO SOLVE THAT QUESTION WE NEED TO DEAL WITH INVERSE CONDEMNATION MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE THAT'S A BIG ISSUE. NOT JUST FOR THE UTILITIES BUT FRANKLY FOR RATEPAYERS WAR WE'RE GONNA BE SECURITIZED AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. IN ADDITIONAL RATES FOR CUSTOMERS BECAUSE WILD FIRES AGAIN TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR CONTINUED TO BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SO WE GOT A LOT OF BIG ISSUES ON THE ENERGY FRONT THAT NEED TO GET RESOLVED BEFORE WE TAKE THIS STEP. OF MOVING TO A 100% CLEAN ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE WILL NOW HERE JUST STAY -- NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION. AND RECOGNIZE IN THE COMMENTS ORGAN MADE IN OPPOSITION THAT YOU'RE ALIGN YOURSELF WITH. BUT I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M SORRY YOU'RE YOU'RE ONE OF THE OKAY. IF JUST TWO MINUTES I WILL I'LL TAKE ONE AND TWO ONE HEARD A MICHAEL SHAW CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ECHO THE COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES ARE VERY TESTIFIED. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ONE THING YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT ON RELIABILITY. HOW THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT TODAY WE SEE WITH THE? INFAMOUS TUCKER -- AND THE RAMP AND IT OCCURS IN THE EVENING HOURS -- THE POTENTIAL FOR PUSHING THE LADY OR THE ROLE AT RENEWABLES HIGHER AND HIGHER -- CREATES ADDITIONAL RELIABILITY ISSUES WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION AT THIS POINT TIME. TECHNOLOGY IS CERTAINLY ADVANCING WEEK KNOWLEDGE THAT WE APPRECIATE -- THAT AND THEY THE THAT'S GOOD SENATOR. OF FORM PRO TEM'S -- EFFORTS TO TO PUSH THAT FORWARD HOWEVER WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS APPROPRIATE TO GAMBLE A CALIFORNIA'S -- ECONOMIC FUTURE ON THAT PARTICULAR -- EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN SO HAS NOT OCCURRED SO WITH THAT I IN THE COMMENTS HAD MADE FOR THAT WE OPPOSE US TWO HUNDRED THANK YOU.

SEEING NO OTHERS WHO ARE PREPARED. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE FROM THE PUBLIC OF SENATOR -- I THINK. IT MIGHT BE IF WE COULD JUST IN TERMS OF BRINGING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. OF ONE THAT IS ON MY MIND AS IT'S ARE REFLECTED IN SOME OF THE COMMENTS OF OPPOSITION. AND TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY OR LOCK INTO IT WHERE THE UTILITIES HAVE SORT OF OUTLINED SERVANT UNCERTAIN FUTURE IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES THAT A REAL TERMS OF WILDFIRES [inaudible] YEAH. PARTING CUSTOMERS AND WHAT THAT REPRESENTS I KNOW THAT AND YOU'RE PUTTING FORTH THIS BILL THAT THOSE WERE NOT LOST ON YOU. CAN YOU ADDRESS IT UP WE YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS AROUND OFF RAMPS AND OTHER IDEAS THAT YOU THINK MIGHT. HELP ADDRESS WHICH YOU HEARD OF CIRCUITS YOU THINK YOU'RE MUCH I'M SECURING THE IS NOT LOST ON ME OUT WE SEE -- THE RAVAGES OF OF OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT IT'S DONE -- TO CALIFORNIA OUR SUMMERS ARE ARE MUCH HARDER AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE MORE FORCE FIRES WHICH A HISTORICALLY WERE SEASONAL THERE ARE NO LONGER SEASON OPENER THERE YEAR ROUND WITH FIRES. A BURNING AT A MUCH -- INTENSE RATES ARE. IN NUDGES A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT ALL OVER THE STE PRIVATELY INVESTED -- INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE ARE VERY CHALLENGE BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH REGARD TO CLIMATE CHANGE THEY HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE THEM RIGHT NOW. THE ROOM SURVIVABILITY -- AS THE AS INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY WITH REGARDS TO INVERSE CONDEMNATION NE LIABILITY ISSUES THAT WILL BE BEFORE ALL OF US YOU KNOW SOON BOTH REPUBLICANS AS WELL AS DEMOCRATS. TO MAKE A DECISION WITH REGARDS TO RATEPAYERS A CALIFORNIA AND ALSO SHAREHOLDERS THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES USER LEGITIMATE -- ISSUES BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT. DECISIVELY BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO PERHAPS BE THE NEW NEW WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR CLIMATE CHANGE AND SITTING ON THE SIDELINES AND NOT ON THE FRONT LINES GOING TO MAKE THE SITUATION ACTUALLY EVEN WORSE UNLESS YOU HAVE VERY CLEAR GOALS ARE STATED. A VERY CLEAR MANDATE A PURCHASE A VERY CLEAR PLAN NOT A MANDATE AS WHAT'S PHRASE NOT ILLEGAL MANDATE THAT HAS A CIVIL OR CRIMINAL. LAW PENALTY IF YOU WILL SENATE BILL. THREE FIFTY IT NEVER HAD A CIVIL OR CRIMINAL -- PENALTY IF YOU WILL WITHOUT REACHING THOSE TARGETS AND GOALS LET ME TRY -- MISTER CHAIR TO SORT OF UNPACK IF YOU WILL OF A LITTLE THE COMETS ARE MADE BY. THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM UP PACIFIC GAS -- TO NOT WANTING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH STANDARDS -- WOULD GOALS OF A PLAN -- ON OUR PS UNLESS OTHER -- ENTITIES IN THIS CASE TELL PIPE THE INVADERS THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR OR ALSO ARE TREATED WITH THE SAME BRUSH. ON THAT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF GOING TO WAR. BUT WITH TWENTY NINE MILLION -- INDIVIDUAL -- DRIVERS IT IT IS NOT THAT THE SAME ECONOMIC SCALE -- IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT METRIC. YOU HAVE THREE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES PLUS A HANDFUL OF OF MUNICIPALLY OWNED UTILITIES TO OVERSEE THE GRID. AND TO COMPARE THAT WITH. TWENTY NINE MILLION INDIVIDUAL. DRIVERS IN THE IN CALIFORNIA IS IS APPLES AND ORANGES IS TO QUIT WHEN UP SAYING THAT. I DON'T WANT YOU TO SET STANDARDS WITH THE NATURAL. GAS. PLANTS MELISSA YOU ACTUALLY GO AFTER THE TWENTY NINE IN THE MITCHELL A INDIVIDUAL DRIVERS -- I I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THE PERSPECTIVE BUT IT IT IT DOESN'T WORK AYE IT IS APPLES AND ORANGES RIGHT HERE ALL TIMIDLY. UP WHEN I'M GONE YOU KNOW AFTER TWENTY EIGHTEEN A THROUGH YOUR LEADERSHIP YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR TO THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR OF THE UTILITIES -- COMEDIAN THE SENATE CENTER BEN HUESO IN IN YOU KNOW LEADERS HERE ALREADY. MISS LAURA FRIEDMAN AND OTHERS MISTER EDUARDO GARCIA DOCTOR BILL QUIRK. LET'S MEET BE UP TO YOU AND AND YOUR LEADERSHIP AND THE COURAGE DEBTS DEBTS DEMONSTRATED FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA MISS BURKE AS WELL TO I KNOW SHE'S BEEN IN THE CLIMATE SPACES WHILE. TO UP WHAT STANDARD YOU SET FORTH. AS WE MOVE FORWARD POST TWENTY EIGHTEEN ONE NINE A FEW OTHER -- INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL LEAD IN THIS SPACE WILL BE GONE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE STANDARDS THAT YOU SET FOR TO WITH REGARDS TO THE TAILPIPE INVADERS OF OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND OTHER OTHER CRITERIA POLLUTANTS ALTMAN IT'LL BE UP TO YOUR LEADERSHIP TO SIDE WHICH YOU WANT TO DO. BUT YOU CAN'T EQUATE BECAUSE IT'S APPLES AND ORANGES -- AND THAT'S THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE HERE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THAT IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT. A METRIC DEL ALTOGETHER. REGARDS TO EQUALIZE TREATMENT BETWEEN THE TWO A ENTITIES IOUS AND THE MO USE OBVIOUSLY THE AMMO USE OUR ARE GOVERNED FROM THE SEAT YOU SEE THE I USED THAT THE P. UC. THAT ULTIMATELY WHEN MAYBE IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL. SENATOR OR SOMETHING MEMBER HERE AT AND IN THIS COMMITTEE IF THEY WANT TO ENGAGE WITH THE I USE AND DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE WHAT I WOULD SAY THIS. IF WE CAN WORK IT OUT ON THIS MEASURE THAT THEN WE CAN'T WORK IT OUT WITH THIS MEASURE YOU MAY WANT TO MOVE FORWARD ON AN ONGOING ISSUE AS STATED. IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR TEN YEARS CLOSE TO A DECADE TO EQUALIZE TREATMENT BETWEEN THE MUNIZ. AND THE I USE THIS IS NOT THE SPACE OR THE VEHICLE TO TO DO SO WE'RE TRYING. TO THE AGREED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY WITH THE MUNICIPALLY OWNED UTILITIES. AND AND QUITE FRANKLY TO PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT. INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN THAT SUPPORTIVE OF OUR PS. THAT THE FIRST 00220% NOT THE AND THEY BECAME SUPPORTERS OF SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY IF YOU WILL -- OF WHAT WE INCENTIVIZE TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION. THAT IS FOR THE BIRTH FOREVER. OF FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME GETTING INTO THE MARKET ARENA TO COMPETE WITH OTHER -- ENTITIES FOR MARKET SHARE IN THIS CASE -- TRANSPORTATION EDUCATION CHARGING STATIONS THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY BECAME A SUPPORTER OF SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY SO HISTORICALLY WHEN IT COMES FROM YUBA PORTFOLIO STANDARDS. THE I USE HAVE NOT BEEN STRONG SUPPORTERS. A I KNOW DOCTOR QUIRK AND DOCTOR EGGMAN HAD A QUESTION CHEN. AND SO WILL TURN TO DR QUIRK IN THEM. DOCTORED. ALRIGHT SO THERE WERE NO A LOT OF WHAT WAS BROUGHT UP HERE -- BY THE OPPOSITION. WHAT'S THE CONCERN ABOUT PARTY LOAD IN UNCERTAINTY. HOWEVER SOME OF THE SAME PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT THIS UP. EITHER ARE ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT THIS UP. EITHER WERE IN FAVOR OF DIRECT ACCESS A TO THE CHAMBER -- CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS IN TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION OR DIDN'T OPPOSE IT NAMELY THE YACHT UTILITIES. IF THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT DEPARTING LOW AND FRANKLY I THINK THEY SHOULD BE. I BUT THEN WHY WEREN'T THEY OPPOSED TO DIRECT ACCESS -- CAN'T [inaudible] YOU CAN'T. WANT DIRECT ACCESS AND THEN ALSO SAY WE CAN'T DO A 100% RENEWABLES. BECAUSE WE'RE DEPARTING LOVED -- THAT'S THE FIRST CONTRADICTION I SEE FROM THE OPPONENT SO LET ME SAY I DID NOT DECIDE THEY WOULD VOTE FOR THIS BILL UNTIL ABOUT FIVE FIFTEEN LAST NIGHT. AND I WAS WITH THE AUTHOR AT THAT TIME WITH HIS STAFF. AND AS PEOPLE COME TO MY OFFICE FOR THE LAST -- YEAR AND A HALF WELL THESE BILLS BEEN UP. I'M I SAID LOOK I CAN ONLY VOTE FOR THIS BILL IF THERE ARE CERTAIN AMENDMENTS -- AND THOSE AMENDMENTS HAD BEEN TAKEN AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR HIS STAFF. AND THE VARIOUS COMMITTEE STAFF FOR I THINK AMENDING THIS BILL IN A WAY THAT IT IS NOW VERY SUPPORTABLE. THERE UNDOUBTEDLY ARE -- A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED ONE OF THEM HERE IS. A WILDFIRE THE AND THE CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THAT -- WORKING TOGETHER WITH OTHERS AROUND THIS TABLE. WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IT HASN'T BEEN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED. BUT IT CAN'T BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THIS BELL. ARE. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SCHUMER CHOICE ACT AGGREGATORS SHE CA HAS. PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE FOR THE STRANDED ASSETS. AND SHOULD WE GET DIRECT ACCESS. THROUGH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY AGAIN PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. OF THE FOR THE STRANDED ASSETS. THAT'S NOT THE CASE RIGHT NOW BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE PROCEEDING IN FRONT OF THE P. YOU SEE AT THIS MOMENT WILL SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. AGAIN THIS BILL CANNOT SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS. UP ONE OF THE BIGGEST ARE QUESTIONS THAT WAS RAISED HERE WERE EQUAL RULES AND AND THE QUESTION OF COST IN THAT WAS MENTIONED BY ALL OF THE OPPOSITION. WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT? IT DEFINITELY CONTAINS COST CONTAINMENT UNLIKE SOME OF OUR OTHER -- MANDATES AND LET ME READ THAT SECTION. OUR PAGE. EIGHTEEN ARM SECTION SEE. ARM AND G.. ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE I THINK OF THIS IS PAGE. TEN THE COMMISSION SHALL ESTABLISH A LIMITATION FOR EACH ELECTRICAL CORPORATION ON THE PROCUREMENT EXPENDITURES. FOR ALL RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES USED COMPLY WITH THE RENEWABLES PORTFOLIO STANDARD. LIMITATION SHALL BE SET EVAN LOW LEVEL AND LISTEN CAREFULLY HERE THAT PREVENTION DISPROPORTIONATE RATE IMPACTS. FURTHER IT SAYS IN SECTION DE. IF THE COST LIMITATION FOR ELECTRICAL CORPORATION IS INSUFFICIENT. SUPPORT THE PROJECTED COSTS OF MEETING THE RENEWABLES PORTFOLIO STANDARD REQUIREMENTS. THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATION MAY REFRAIN FROM ENTERING INTO NEW CONTRACTS ARE CONSTRUCTING FACILITIES. BEYOND THE QUANTITY THAT CAN BE PROCURED WITHIN THE LIMITATION UNLESS ELIGIBLE RENEWABLE RESOURCES. CAN BE PROCURED WITHOUT EXCEEDING A DEMAND AMISS INCREASE IN RATES. SO THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PART OF THE BILL. AND IT IS IT REALLY BREAKS GROUND COMPARED TO OTHER MANDATES THAT WE'VE HAD. FURTHER ON PAGE EIGHTEEN SO THERE'S A QUESTION IS EVERYONE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS. AND WHAT WE SEEM FROM THE CCA'S THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS BEFORE. IS THAT THEY WOULD GO AND PURCHASE A RENEWAL BOWLER AND THEN -- THE CUT PLACE THAT HAD -- THE LOUD THAT HAD GIVEN THEM THAT ENERGY WITH THEN GO OUT AND PURCHASE COAL. WE HAVE TO PREVENT THAT AND FORTUNATELY AGAIN I BELIEVE THIS WAS TAKEN IN NATURAL RESOURCES IT SAYS ON PAGE -- EIGHTEEN OF THE BILL -- LINE. TWENTY NINE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS POLICY FOR CALIFORNIA SHALL NOT INCREASED CARBON EMISSIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE REST YOUR GRID. ENCHILADA ALLOW RESOURCE SHUFFLING -- THAT WAS A KEY PART AGAIN OF MY ACCEPTING THIS SO THERE BEEN PEOPLE PUSHING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. I'VE SAID WITHOUT THE PROPER AMENDMENTS I CANNOT ACCEPT THIS THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF TO THE AMENDMENTS I'VE TAKEN THE I THINK DO ANSWER. QUESTIONS FROM THE OPPOSITION. SO AGAIN I WOULD URGE US TO GO FORWARD. THE UTILITIES AND OTHERS DO FACE CHALLENGES WELL BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL. FROM WILDFIRES AND OTHER ISSUES WE NEED TO SOLVE THOSE BUT THAT'S NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL. THIS BILL ANSWERS MY QUESTIONS SETS A GOAL BUT NOT A GOAL THAT WILL BE ACHIEVED IF THE COST IS TOO HIGH. AND WILL NOT BE ACHIEVED THROUGH SHUFFLING THE DECK. SO I AM FIRMLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE I THANK YOU. I THINK DOCTOR QUIRK AS MAY HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB WITH YOUR BILL SENATORS AND SO SEVENTIES TECHNICAL QUESTIONS BECAUSE THOSE ARE SO MY MY REMARKS ARE GOING TO BE DO YOU FEEL LIKE. ABOUT LINUS. WITHOUT DOCTOR QUIRK PRESENTED. THAT THAT IS A SUFFICIENT OFFRAMP. FOR THIS BILL IF COSTS BECOME OUT OF CONTROL. CONCERT MONSIEUR A FILAMENTOUS AYE AYE WHAT OSES IT'S I DON'T THINK I COULD EVER ARTICULATED BETTER OF THEN THE DOCTOR QUIRK OF QUITE FRANKLY. NO WE HAD A VERY MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION WE WORKED VERY HARD WITH REGARDS TO THE NECESSARY OFF RAMPS IF YOU WILL IN THE EVENTS -- IF THE COST OF HAS AN IMPACT. THE VOTE PRIVATE RESIDENCES OR WHETHER THEY'RE BUSINESSES THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA GO 41100% CLEAN ENERGY IS TO GO. TO CARBON FREE 1100% TO JUST REACH A GOAL FOR THE GOAL SAKE BUT RATHER WE TAKEN TO MINE. YOU KNOW THE ECONOMY AND WHAT THE NECESSARY OFF RAMPS ARE A TO EXIT THE IF YOU WILL IF THINGS THAT ARE UNFORESEEN CATASTROPHES ECONOMIC CATASTROPHES ECONOMIC DEPRESSION. OR I SHOULD SAY -- IT'S JUST A DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE NOT SUFFICIENT -- I WAS GONNA GO OVER IT THAT THAT WAS YOUR RIG WHEN YOU ORIGINAL QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR WHICH I DID NOT. A ANSWER ORIGINALLY BUT I'VE SEEN MISTER A DOCTOR QUIRK ANSWERED HIM [inaudible] SO. AS YOU SAY THAT ARE YOU SEEING THIS AS A MANDATE OR PLANNING GOAL POLITICAL. WERE ALL CLEAR THAT'S THIS IS A PLANNING ALL THIS IS OVER GOING FOR BECAUSE OF THE BILL THREE FIFTIES A PLANNING GOAL. BECAUSE I WOULD SAY -- ONE OF THE THE ISSUES DOCTOR QUICK BROUGHT UP WITH THAT -- PERHAPS A DISPARITY IN THE AT OPPOSITION IS I THINK PEOPLE ARE DOING. KINDA RESPONDING SOMETIMES ARE SCATTER SHOT APPROACH AND THEY'RE TRYING TO COVER THEIR BASES IF WE'RE GONNA GO DIRECT ACCESS OF THAT'S GOOD LOWER COSTS IN OF ME PROCUREMENT. THERE OKAY WITH THAT BUT SO I MEAN I I I JUST CONTINUE TO CAUTION ALL OF US AS WE GO FORWARD WE CAN'T BREATHE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE SMOKE IS SO BAD IN THE VALLEY A AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S FROM CLIMATE CHANGE WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS THAT. BUT WE ALSO HAVE ONGOING ECONOMIES THAT WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF S. ARE GOING FORWARD AND LARGE INVESTMENTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE MADE IN INFRASTRUCTURE. SO I ALSO HEAR YOU SAYING IN THIS THAT YOU ARE. COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE STRANDED ASSETS ISSUE THAT COMES UP HAZARD UP A NEW GAS PLANT IN MY DISTRICT THAT PEOPLE STILL TRYING TO PAY. FOR AND REPEAL HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. WHETHER WE GO DO WITHOUT OR NOT. AND YOU ARE STILL COMMITTED TO MOVE MOUSA THAN A MONTH SINCE I AM A SICK MAN BUT BUT MISS AGAIN DAILAMITE THIS EGGMAN DO THE ANSWER IS IS IS YES I'M STRANDED ASSETS HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR MANY VIA AT THE TILL HE'S FOR ALL PARTY REASONS YOU KNOW WE WON'T GO INTO RIGHT NOW SPECIFICALLY BUT A BC IT'S A CONSUMER THE RAPE PARA WHO GET STRANDED ALSO BY MANAGEMENT -- THAT'S WEIGHT MANAGEMENT DECISION THAT ARE -- BICU USE OR I SHOULD SAY SPECIFICALLY VALUES -- HAVE BEEN IMPACT -- AND SO THE ANSWER IS YES AND AND YOUR RIGHTS WITH REGARDS TO THE PS THEM THAT IS A PLANNING GO TO SPANGLED BUT THERE WOULD DO AND NOT DOING ANYTHING WITH THE WITH THE CCA'S. YOU'RE JUST SAYING WE'RE GONNA LEAVE OUT OF THE LEGISLATORS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT LATER. THANK YOU MISS THE OLYMPICS EGGMAN [inaudible] GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF WAS GALLAGHER SENATOR [inaudible] MY I HAVE A QUESTION FIRST IS THAT YOU KNOW IN THE BILL IT TALKS ABOUT. HAVING A BOUNCE IN BEING ABLE TO USE ZERO CARBON RESOURCES IS THE TERM THAT'S USED BUT THERE'S NO DEFINITION. IN THE BILL ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES ZERO CARBON RESOURCES -- WOULD THAT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE NUCLEAR HYDRO ELECTRIC. AND GEOTHERMAL -- ENERGY A IN THERE AND BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. THAT'S NOT REALLY DEFINED IN IT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE THAT MIGHT BE LEFT UP TO THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES -- AND FOR ME I THINK THAT WE SHOULD TRY AND ESTABLISH THAT HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTES -- ZERO CARBON RESOURCES OTHERWISE IT CREATES UNCERTAINTY AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY OF WHAT THE ZERO CARBON MARKET IS GONNA BE INTO THE FUTURE -- SO EVER COULD YOU ANSWER IT COULD YOU JUST I QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GOING TO DEFINE THAT TERM POOL IT WOULDN'T INCLUDE THOSE TYPES OF OF ENERGY IT WILL IT WILL SAY THIS MISTER CALDERON THAT THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I WANTED TO PROVIDE. OF FLEXIBILITY WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE ON THE RISE AND AS LONG AS IT'S ZERO CARBON THERE'S SOME -- POTENTIAL -- ENERGY RESOURCES. SO FOR EXAMPLE -- WOULD DESERVE IN A STEP CITY NUCLEAR FOR EXAMPLE COULD NUCLEAR BE YOU KNOW CONCEIVABLY PART OF THE OUR PS A IT COULD BE NOW WAYS IT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. NOW ISN'T IT THAT'S A QUESTION THERE'S A MAKES SENSE -- WITH REGARDS TO PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF DOLLARS AND CENTS -- I DON'T KNOW GIVEN THE FACT THAT. THAT WE HAVE TO PLANTS A A DIABLO CANYON AS WELL AS SENATE NO FREE AT SOMEBODY BEING MOTHBALLED. DIABLO CANYON ARE OWNED. BY ANOTHER STRAND OF ACID YOU KNOW BY OUT. OF P. GENIE THAT'S BEING A MOTHBALL THE PLAN TO BE MOTHBALLED SO THAT IT'S OPEN ENDED -- ó WANT TO KEEP IT OPEN AND IT WAS ANY POTENTIAL NEW TECHNOLOGY DEBTS CREATED. NAM I IN THE FUTURE IT COULD BE IS ON THAT ZERO CARBON VETO SO OBVIOUSLY IT CLEARLY ALLOWS FOR GEOTHERMAL AS WELL. WHAT ABOUT HYDRO BECAUSE RIGHT NOW AS YOU KNOW? IS A LESSON THIRTY MEGAWATTS YOU THAT CAN COUNT THAT OVER THIRTY MEGAWATT HYDRO DOESN'T COUNT TOWARDS IPS COULD IT BE INCLUDED IN THE ZERO EMISSION. OUR RESOURCE WE LOVE AND WE LEFT BEHIND WHAT WE DO IT'S VERY SPECIFICALLY WE ESTABLISH THIS AND SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY TWO IN THE 40% WE ALLOW FOR HYDRO -- WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS NO -- BRANIEWO HYDRO PLANTS THAT THAT WERE CREATED THAT THERE ESTABLISH HYDRO PLANTS ARE READY. A IN CALIFORNIA AND NOT BE SEE WE HAVE A P. JEANNIE PARTICULAR OWNS A QUITE A FEW HAD TO PLANTS I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY SPECIFICALLY WE KNOW COMMUNITIES OWN -- HYDRO PLANTS THEY'RE ALLOWED IN THE THE CAVIAR HERE NOT SO MUCH TO CARRY OUT BUT A KNOWN YOU ESTABLISHED A HYDRO PLANTS -- CAN BE CREATED. SO IF YOU HAVE A AS AN ASSET THEY CAN BE -- THEY QUALIFY AS PART OF THAT OUR PS NOW INCLUDE OVER THIRTY MEGAWATT HIGH MISSING ANYTHING GOING TO CHECK OUT LIMIT LET ME GET THAT'S A PRE ABOUT REAL QUICK WHAT THE COULD I I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT NOTED. THE 40% AT SENATOR POINTED OUT. AND ANSWERING DOCTOR QUIRK AND DOCTOR RECOMMENDS QUESTION IS THAT IT IS PLANNING IT NOTHING IN THIS BILL LOCKS PERSON AND HE WENT ON A SPECIFIC SOURCES BEYOND -- INTO THE 40% SORTS PLANNING ITS ASPIRATIONAL TERMS OF WHAT THAT ULTIMATELY BECOME SO THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THAT'S GOING TO BE. KIND OF PART OF FUTURE CONVERSATION OF HOW THAT DEMOCRATS IT IS DEFINED. THE FUTURE CONVERSATION WITH A LOANS EITHER WAY IN OTHER WORDS THIS BILL DOES NOT SPECIFY. ONCE. THIRTY THREE AND THAT'S MY CONCERN. HOW IT MISTER GALLAGHER THROUGH THE CHERUB ON SPECIFICALLY YOUR YOUR QUESTION IS? HOW DO WE IS A PART OF THE 40% BUT YOU HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO ABOVE. A THIRTY THREE OF MEGAWATT EXISTING POINT EXIST HIGH VISITING LARGELY DISABILITIES THAT HAVE MORE THAN THIRTY MEGAWATTS. YEAH ARE THEY INCLUDED THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTIONING AND FIND OUT THE ANSWER FOR YOU RIGHT NOW REAL TIME SO GOING HOW CAN YOU THE ANSWER SHOULD BE YES BUT I WANT TO BE. OF CERTAIN FOR YOU OFFER OKAY. BIG DEBTS THE ANSWER IS YES. MATHIS WE WENT A LOT OF THE THE ANSWER IS YES AND IN PART OF WHAT AT THE CHAIRMAN JUST KIND OF PLAN AS IT'S NOT REALLY. SPELLED OUT AND AND AND PART OF THIS WAS A CONVERSATION IS GOING TO HAPPEN LATER -- I WANTED TO HAPPEN HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE I DON'T WANT TO BE DETERMINED BY THE AGENCIES YOU KNOW AT THEIR WHIM WHAT THEY'D DETERMINE CONSTITUTES. A ZERO CARBON I THINK THAT WE SHOULD DO THAT I MEAN ONE OF MY CRITICISMS HAS BEEN THAT LOOK WE NEED TO LEGISLATE WE NEED TO FIND THESE THINGS. HERE ARE NOT LEAVE THAT UP TO SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONES WHO ARE ACCOUNTABLE YOU KNOW TO OUR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT HOW THIS GETS IMPLEMENTED HOW GETS. AND TAKEN OUT AND SO. THIS KNOW MY CONCERNS YOU KNOW WITH THIS POLICY IS. ONE I FEEL LIKE UP UNTIL THIS POINT. WE TALK ABOUT OF RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD FOR THE DOESN'T SEEM TOO MUCH OF A PORTFOLIO LARGELY IT HAS BEEN. SOLAR AND WIND -- SOME GEOTHERMAL WHERE WE CAN DO THAT BUT IT'S BEEN LIMITED. AND WE HAEN'T REALLY OPENED UP THAT THERE'S NOT A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO THE CAN HELP US. YOU ACTUALLY ACTUALLY GET TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF RENEWAL BOARD. OF BEING USE HYDRO IS RENEWABLE RESOURCE IS A RENEWABLE POWER RESOURCE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE SHOULD BE UTILIZING. TO REACH THAT NON SO. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE PORTFOLIO -- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT RATE IMPACT NOW WE CAN SAY IN THE BILL THAT. WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THIS DOESN'T HAVE AN UNREASONABLE. IMPACT ON RATES WHAT DOES THAT MEAN YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER AND REASONABLE WHEN WE FIRST STARTED OUR PS. THERE WAS A WARNING FROM THE CPUC THAT THIS COULD RAISE RATES FOR RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS UPWARDS OF 30%. THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE GOT THE STATS BACK. AND AND RESIDENTIAL ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY RATES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHERE 34% HIGHER. COMMERCIAL RATES WERE 48% HIGHER. AN INDUSTRIAL RATES WERE 76% HIGHER. AND NOW WE'RE GONNA IT NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO YOU KNOW NOW WE'VE JUST SAID THE POLICY LAST YEAR TO GO. TO FIFTY NOW WE'RE GONNA SET UP PLANNING GOAL THE SIXTY TO A HUNDRED WHERE THE RATES GOING TO GO THAT THE WE KNOW HISTORY IS THE BEST INDICATOR OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN RATES ARE GOING TO INCREASE. WHO'S GOING TO DETERMINE WHAT IS AN UNREASONABLE IMPACTOR RATES IS IT GONNA BE THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO BE AN AGENCY. WHO'S GOING TO DETERMINE WHAT'S DOMENICI'S. THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD DEFINE. AND THE PROBLEM IS. HERE'S A REALITY AND MANHATTAN MANHATTAN INSTITUTE DID A STUDY ON THIS. AND THEY SAID THAT NEARLY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS LIVE IN ENERGY POVERTY WHICH MEANS THEY PAY MORE THAN 10%. OTHER DISPOSABLE INCOME FOR ELECTRICITY. THAT'S A VERY TOUGH THING TO SWALLOW ESPECIALLY IN MY DISTRICT. I THINK IN YOUR DISTRICT AS WELL SENATOR I AND IN MANY PARTS OF IN THE CALIFORNIA THEY POINT OUT THAT. YOU KNOW SAN FRANCISCO IT'S ONLY THREE POINT 6% LIVE ENERGY POLICY. BUT IN EMLYN CENTRAL VALLEY CALIFORNIA'S 15%. THAT LIVE IN THAT. AT THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE AND IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THINGS THAT. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT DIRECT AXIS THAT IS AND THAT. THAT'S LIKE SWATTING AND THAT THE BIG COST DRIVER. IN CALIFORNIA AND ENERGY HAS BEEN OUR PS PERIOD IS RAISE RATES TO CERTAIN WOULDN'T LOSE CHAIR. UP LET ME JUST FINISH NOW AND YOU AYE YOU CAN RESPOND TO EACH OF THESE THINGS BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT HAS RAISE RATES. AND IS MADE IT VERY HARD WE HAVE THE HIGHEST. ENERGY IS PART OF THAT BECAUSE IT'S PART OF OUR DISPOSE IF YOU CAN'T GET AROUND YOUR P. JEANNIE BILL BELIEVE ME I'M A FATHER. AND MY WIFE THE MOTHER WE PAY THE BILL. EVERY DOLLARYEAH AYE AYES AYE CUT YOU OFF BUT I THINK AND IN ORDER -- FOR THE SENATOR TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION THEN MAYBE YOU CAN JUST. I WILL I WILL BE I WILL BE VERY FAMILIAR AT ALL WITH THE COURT HELD A NEWS OF THE FINISH UP THE LAST COUPLE POINTS AND THEN I WOULD I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE SENATOR RESPOND TO THIS BECAUSE AT THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. IT'S AN IMPORTANT -- ONE WE CAN'T SUSTAIN BASELOAD POWER THAT'S THE ISSUE YOU CAN'T SUSTAIN BASE LOW POWER ON RENEWABLE. RESOURCES ALONE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COUNT HYDRO AND THAT'S STILL AN OPEN QUESTION -- ENERGY DEMAND IS GOING TO INCREASE NOT GO DOWN BECAUSE PRECISELY BECAUSE OF TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION ALL THESE CHARGING STATIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. GUESS WHAT NEED ELECTRICITY. TO PROVIDE THESE CHARGING STATIONS INTO CHARGE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. SO IT'S GONNA GO UP AND IF IF IF POWERS INTERMITTENT. AND FROM WHAT WILL MOSTLY A SOLARIUM WHEN. YOU DON'T HAVE THAT BASE OF POWER WE'RE GOING TO NEED NATURAL GAS WE'RE GOING TO NEED HYDRO. THOSE THINGS TO HELP SUSTAIN IT. JOBS VERY QUICKLY -- YES THIS HAS CREATED SOME. VERY GOOD PAYING CONSTRUCTION JOBS ON THE FRONT END. BUT THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE JOBS LIKE THOSE IN THE NATURAL GAS PLANT THIS IN MY DISTRICT CALPINE THAT WAS SHATTERED A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND NOW IS BACK OPEN BECAUSE WE KNOW WE NEED IT. WE SHATTERED IT. LET EVERYBODY OFF NOW WE BROUGHT RIGHT BACK ON BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY NEED THE POWER THOSE ARE GOOD PAYING JOBS THAT SUSTAIN PEOPLE LONG TERM. NOT JUST FOR THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD BUT HEY PEOPLE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK THERE AND MAINTAIN THEIR SO THERE IS A BIG IMPACT TO JOBS FROM THAT. STANDPOINT AND WE NEED LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE JOBS AS WELL. FIRES WE'VE ALWAYS HAD FIRES AND AS SOMEONE WHO'S FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TRUSTS ME WE'VE BEEN SAYING FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. SO THEY DON'T NEED AYE AYE AGAIN I I DON'T WANT TO BE -- RUDE BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE WRAP UP YOUR VERY INTERESTING AND VERY APPROPRIATE STATEMENT [inaudible] WITH. CLEAR QUESTION SO THAT WE CAN POSE IT TO THE IT OF THE AUTHOR AND THEN WE CAN LOOK TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE HAS ANY QUESTIONS. AND THEN MOVE ON WITH THAT THE HEARING SO I PREACH I KNOW THIS IS MORE OF A STATEMENT MISTER CHAIRMAN RELATED IS IT'S PART OF THAT THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THEIR VERY IMPORTANT POINTS THAT WE SHOULD ALL CONSIDER WHEN WE'RE GOING TO PASS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT THIS IT'S OKAY TO TAKE TIME AND COMMITTEE ADDED I KEEP SAYING THAT IT'S OKAY TO TAKE TIME COMMITTEE THESE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA PASS SIGNIFICANT POLICY THAT AFFECTS THE ENTIRE STATE. AND I WILL MY DAD IF I COULD AND I WILL SOME A LITTLE VERY THIS HAS BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE I KNOW THAT YOU'RE NEW TO THE COMMITTEE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR ABILITY YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WANT TO PUT YOUR COMMENTS ON THE RECORD. BUT YOU'VE HAD -- A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME TO DO SO SO IF YOU COULD JUST WRAP UP AND THEN WE CAN. MOVE FORWARD WITH RESPOND LET ME JUST M. WITH FIRES. FIRE IS NOT A NEW NORMAL IS NOT A NEW NORMAL WE HAVE HAD FIRED SIGNIFICANT FOREST FIRES AND FOR THE PAST AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING WE NEED BETTER FORESTRY MANAGEMENT WE NEED TO CLEAN CLEAN HAVE BETTER MANAGEMENT IN OUR FORCE. IN ORDER TO HAVE A MORE SUSTAINABLE FORCE AND NOT HAVE CATASTROPHIC FIRES THAT WE FED. THAT'S IN THE NORTH STATE THAT'S DOWN IN SAN DIEGO. AND WE'VE HAD THESE FIRES CAN WE HAVE THEM EVERY YEAR WE'VE HAD THEM EVERY YEAR NOW I WILL ADMIT THAT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS EXACERBATED THAT BUT WE'VE ALWAYS HAD IT. AND THE PROBLEM IS WE'VE DONE. ESSENTIALLY ZERO ON FORESTRY MANAGEMENT AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST CARBON EMITTER IN THE STATE. THE BIGGEST CARBON EMITTER IN THE STATE IS FOR SOME WE DONE VIRTUALLY NOTHING ABOUT IT. SO THAT'S GREAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE OR ELECTRICAL GRID. ZERO BUT YOU STILL HAVE ALL THESE FOUR SPIRES OF THE DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CARBON EMISSION AND IF WE BUY POWER FROM OTHER WESTERN STATES WERE DOING COAL FIRED PLANTS. WHO ARE DOING HYDRO THAT WE WON'T DO -- YEAH I MEAN DOES THAT MAKE ANY KIND OF SENSE WHILE OUR RATE PAYERS PAY EXPONENTIALLY MORE. AND LIVE IN ENERGY POVERTY. THAT TO ME IS JUST NOT A LONG TERM -- VIABLE PLAN FOR ENERGY AYE I THINK THERE'S A LOT WE TALK ABOUT THIS LOT THIS COMMITTEE. BUT WE NEED TO GET IT RIGHT. AND THAT MEANS TAKING A PAUSE AND MAYBE NOT JUST FAST FORWARDING ON THIS ONE WE JUST DID A MANDATE LAST YEAR -- AND WITHOUT ALL AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU IF I IF I COULD TURN DOCTOR QUIRK AND THEN AND SO THERE ARE. TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL -- COMMENT ON DO YOU S. TAX RULES TO MEN IN THIS IS SET TO FIND HIS POINT 25% SUCH A PRETTY LOW NUMBER -- SO I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. YEAH THERE'S BEEN A MOTION TO PASS ON TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR -- IT'S FRIEDMAN YOU HAD A GOOD QUESTION AND THEN MR GARCIA I JUST HAVE A QUICK COMMENT THAT'S OKAY VERY -- FIRST -- YOU JUST TO TAKE AYE I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE COMMENTS THE DETAILS PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS IN THE TECHNICAL. PART OF THE BILL AND THIS IS A GOAL AND GOING FORWARD THERE WILL BE OTHER LEGISLATION I'M SURE THAT WILL IMPACT THIS. AND IF THERE AREDEFICIENCIES OTHER LEGISLATION COULD ALWAYS BE INTRODUCED. TO TAKE ON ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT CERTAIN TYPES OF VERNE OF HYDROGEN CAN BE RENEWABLE OTHER LEGISLATION COULD ALWAYS BE INTRODUCED. TO DEAL WITH THOSE SUBJECTS IN ANYTHING AT THIS BILL -- HASN'T TACKLE BUT JUST AT THE HIGH LEVEL ALL OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THIS BILL PALE IN COMPARISON WITH THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PRICE OF RENEWABLE SOMETIMES BEING HIGHER ON THAT WILL AS WE SAW WITH SOLAR AS THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE INTRODUCED THAT BRINGS THE PRICE DOWN AND HIS NEW TRANSMISSION IS INTRODUCED IF THAT'S POSSIBLE IN SOME PLACES. THAT BRINGS THE PRICE DOWN BRINGS THE TREATMENT DEALS OF THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM BUT YOU NEVER HAVE THE DRIVER TO BRING THOSE NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO MARKET OR TO DEAL WITH TRANSMISSION ISSUES IN AREAS THAT ARE HAVING TRANSMISSION ISSUES. WITHOUT HAVING A STRONG MARKET SIGNAL SUCH AS IS BEING OB CREATED BY THIS BILL. AND THAT'S WHY HAVING THESE GOALS IS SO IMPORTANT TO SHOW INVESTORS THAT THERE IS -- ARE NEAT THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR THE TECHNOLOGIES OF THEY DO INVEST THEIR DOLLARS -- BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IS THERE -- NEEDING TO PURCHASE THAT TECHNOLOGY AND THAT'S WHY EVEN THOUGH WE MAY BE A SMALL PART OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMITTER IS FOR THE ENTIRE PLANET WHAT WE DO HERE IS SO IMPORTANT. AYE LAST YEAR I WAS VERY HONORED TO HAVE BEEN SENT -- TO GERMANY TO BE PART OF THE COPE CONFERENCE WHICH IS THE PARIS ACCORD GROUP. AND THE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES THAT WALKED UP TO THE CALIFORNIA DELEGATION AND SAID WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH CAP AND TRADE IN WITH EVERYTHING ELSE IN CALIFORNIA IS SO IMPORTANTTO THE REST OF THE WORLD. AND HOW DID YOU DO IT HOW DID YOU GET YOUR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO TO THIS LEVEL WE DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU WERE ABLE TO DO THAT. SO WHAT WE DO TO SET THAT -- TO BE THE LEADER FOR THE WORLD I'M IS BEING WATCHED AND BILLS LIKE THIS ARE VERY IMPORTANT -- BEYOND WHAT THEY MIGHT DO FOR GRIT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS JUST IN CALIFORNIA. I'M WORK CALIFORNIA GOES IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY THE WORLD WILL GO. AND THE ACTION THAT WE'RE TAKING TODAY IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT TO ANY OF US AND TO OUR CHILDREN THAN TO HAVE A HABITABLE PLANET. AND THAT IS IN QUESTION RIGHT NOW. UNDENIABLY AND SO YOU KNOW WE CAN'T MESS AROUND ANY LONGER AND WE HAVE TO TAKE STRONG STEPS SO I'M REALLY PROUD TO BE ABLE TO SUB TODAY. ON THIS COMMITTEE TO BE ABLE TO CAST THIS VOTE I WANNA THANK THE CHAIR AND I CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU BRUCE CHAIRED. SENATOR FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL AND GO FOR BEING A LEADER -- FOR CALIFORNIA. AND THE ISSUES OF THE CLIMATE AND OUR ECONOMIC GUN GOALS THAT INTERSECT. I'M AN ASSOCIATE MYSELF UP TO ABOUT. 30% OF WHAT MISTER GALLAGHER HAS SAID AND I THINK THAT'S A CONSERVATIVE NUMBER -- I MIGHT BE HIGH BUT NEVER THE LESS YOU HE MADE SOME POINTS THAT I'D LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH AS IT RELATES. TO QUESTION THAT HE POSES AS A RELEASE ZERO CARBON ENERGY. I THINK REALLY THE QUESTION IS THAT THE A DIRECT THAT TO TO STEAL A WORD FROM YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THIS QUITE OFTEN. THE INTENTIONALITY RIGHT WHAT WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THERE AND YOU KNOW I THINK HE WENT TO BAT. FOR YOU KNOW MY CONSTITUENTS AS IT RELATES TO THE GEOTHERMAL. AND THE NEED TO DIVERSIFY THE PURPLE YOU RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE PORTFOLIO IS NOT DIVERSE THAT THE LOW COST BEST. FIT MODEL HAS NOT WORKED. TO MEETING THOSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. AYE ON THE WAY OVER HERE AND A CONVERSATION IN PASSING WITH SOMEONE ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT. ALL RENEWABLES THAT MAKES SENSE FROM OUR ECONOMIC STANDPOINT FROM A TECHNOLOGY STANDPOINT. DO NOT GET LEFT BEHIND AND CERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO STEAL. A LINE THERE FROM AND SOME PERSON THAT THAT SERVED. IN DC AT SOME POINT BUT WE REALLY THINK. THAT THERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. TO LOOKING AT ALL OF THE RENEWABLES THAT ARE AVAILABLE PARTICULARLY -- AS WE ARE PRESSED WITH THESE FIRES THAT IT THERE'S A QUESTION AT HAND ON HOW DO WE UTILIZE A BIOMASS -- TECHNOLOGIES ARE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THESE THAT TREATS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GIVEN THAT -- THAT IS BEFORE US TODAY HOW DO WE ADDRESS THESE ECONOMICALLY DISTRESSED. PARTS OF THE STATE. THAT NEED THOSE JOBS AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CALPINE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE IMPERIAL COUNTY REGION THAT HAS 20% UNEMPLOYMENT AT TIMES. HOW WE HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT THOSE RENEWABLES ARE INTEGRATED AS WELL AND THAT THE COST? ISN'T SOLELY THE ONLY MEASUREMENT. OF BEING ABLE TO INTEGRATE THESE RENEWABLES AREN'T INTO THE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS WE HAVE. US SOME WORK TO DO AND CLEARLY IT'S BEEN SAID THAT A COUPLE TIMES OF THIS IS IN THE AND ALL BOMB NO HEARING WE'RE GOING TO SEE. SOME WORK HAPPENING DURING THE SUMMER BREAK IN -- I I'D BE REMISS IF I DID IN HIGH WHETHER POLICY PROPOSALS THAT ARE MOVING BEFORE THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AT THIS COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE. IN THE SENATE HAS SEEN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT REGIONALIZATION -- THE CONVERSATION -- ABOUT -- GOOD GRADE RELIABILITY DISCUSSIONS OUR PROCUREMENT -- SOME WILL CALL -- ARE BILL THAT A CARVE OUT -- CALL IT WHAT YOU WILL WHAT WE'RE INTENDING ON DOING IS WE'RE TRYING TO DIVERSIFY THE PORTFOLIO. AND LOOKING AT IT FROM DIFFERENT LENSES I THINK IS CRITICAL A SOLAR IS IMPORTANT TO US IN THE STATE WIND. IS MUTUALLY IMPORTANT -- TO OUR REGION AND UP BUT THERE ARE OTHER RENEWABLE -- RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO MEET. THIS GOAL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE OF A 100%. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IT'S NOT A QUESTION IT'S MORE OF A THE COMMENT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE GET THERE. THAT THAT WE'RE PUTTING ALL THIS INTO PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THIS WORKS UNLESS WE HAVE A ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE REGIONALIZATION I DON'T THINK IT WORKS. ON AS WE TALK ABOUT DIVERSIFYING THE PORTFOLIO CERTAINLY DON'T THINK IT WORKS FOR ME. IF WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU ARE MORE IN THE SALTON SEA REGION THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION SPIC YOU MUCH -- SERVICE IN THE OBVIOUSLY THROUGH CHARITIES WANNA RECOGNIZE YOUR INCREDIBLE YOU KNOW LEADERSHIP ON A JEW THURMOND I THINK YOU'RE THE KING OF GEOTHERMAL. YOU KNOW OF CALIFORNIA IF YOU'RE IT'S VERY PROUD AS WILL'S GEOTHERMAL VERY PROUD IN IN YOUR A REGION THAT YOU REPRESENT YOU BEEN A CHAMPION YOU FIGHT HARD YOU KNOW -- NOT JUST YOU KNOW REPUBLICANS BUT DEMOCRATS ALIKE -- TO TO PROTECTING. TO TO GROW YOUR INTERESTS AND AND AND YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK THAT WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DIVERSIFY. A PORTFOLIO -- AND HAVE EVERY TOOL BOX A INITIATIVE THAT'S AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THE LOWEST AND AND BEST A COST. OF TO THE CONSUMER A THE BETTER THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT -- SO I JUST WANNA -- THINK YOU'RE MUCH MORE FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND AND AND YOU'RE CHAMPIONING. BOB WE WILL TURN TO A VICE CHAIRMAN'S PATTERSON THEN DOCTOR EGGMAN THAN MISTER MERCER AT TIMES CHAIRMAN APPRECIATED DOT JUST COMMENT -- AND WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE SEEN THE BILL -- DOES. STANDING DISCUSSIONS. AND WITH RESPECT TO IT ARM I JUST WANNA RESPECTFULLY REMIND ALL OF US -- THAT THE OPPOSITION RAISES SOME VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THIS. AND AS THE VICE CHAIR OF THIS TIME I HAVE SEEN THE CONSEQUENCES. UP WE HAVE VERY RAPID A RAMP UP WE HAVE FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS A OF DEMAND TWINS WIND AND SOLAR IS GOING AWAY -- THE RESULT OF THAT HAS BEEN THAT THERE THAT THE GRID HAS BEEN -- MADE RELIABLE AND BALANCED BY LARGE HYDRO. BY NATURAL GAS AND BY IMPORTS ALL OF WHICH ARE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. SUSPECT BY AN UP AND MANY PEOPLE IN THIS -- NOW IN IN THIS LEGISLATURE WE ARE DOING THE SAME THING OVER AGAIN THAT WE DON BEFORE. THIS WILL INCREASE RATES. THIS WILL DECREASE RELIABILITY. THAT COST ANALYSIS HERE I THINK IS M. DE OF ART IS AMBIGUOUS IT IS THE SAME KIND OF AMBIGUITY THAT I THINK -- RAISES SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR WHAT KIND OF RATE INCREASES ARE WE GOING TO SEE. I REALLY DO THINK THAT -- THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY WITH RESPECT OFF RAMPS ARE. A MAJOR CONCERN FOR ME. AND I JUST WANNA ECHO THE OPPONENTS CONCERNS OF WHY I'M GOING TO VOTE NO [inaudible] NOT NOW THIS IS A LEAP OF FAITH AND A GAMBLE GIVEN THE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES OUR RATEPAYERS. AND OUR EMPLOYERS ARE IN AT PRESENTLY AS A RESULT THE PREVIOUS POLICY SO I'M GONNA RESPECTFULLY BUT NO [inaudible] PATRICK. I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE MAKING STATEMENTS NOW -- GA AND I WILL I WILL BE BRIEF SINCE AYE I WOULD ASSOCIATE SOME AYE COMES WITH MR GALLAGHER AND MR GARCIA BUT JUST ON THIS ISSUE OF AND I MEAN TO TO MISTREATMENT TO YOU TO GO BACK. TO USING MY FORMER CAREER AS A AS A THERAPIST OFTENTIMES WHEN WE LOOK WITH WHICH THEY WERE WITH THE NBA THE WORLD WHEN WE LOOK AT SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAMILY DOWN THE STREET THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'VE GOT IT ALL TOGETHER. TO GET INSIDE THE HOUSE RIGHT AND THEN YOU SEE THAT THIS THERE'S MORE ISSUES GOING ON THEN IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE OUTSIDE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH HERE RIGHT WE HOLD OURSELVES OUT AS A BEACON TO THE WORLD AND YET WHEN YOU GET DOWN INTO A WE HAVE A LOT OF DIVISION IN THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE STILL NEED TO WORK OUT. BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT SIGNALS TO THE MARKET WE HAVE SIGNAL TO THE MARKET BEFORE AND HAVE SEEN INVESTMENT AND NOW WE'RE SEEING UP DIFFERENT SIGNALS RATE AND WE'RE WE'RE SHIFTING SIGNALS. SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS I THINK WE NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL BALANCING AND ALSO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO. THAT AGAIN WE ARE VERY INCLUSIVE AND OF THAT I'M ALSO VERY CONCERNED OF THE FLUORESCENT BIOMASS AND AND HOW DO WE HOW DO WE INCLUDE ALL OF THOSE THINGS WHILE THEY MAY NOT BE THE MOST CLAIM. THEY HAVE SO MANY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT OUR ECONOMY AND OUR ENVIRONMENT NEED THAT WE NEED TO HAVE LIKE A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF OF OF RENEWABLES AND MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE COMPREHENSIVE IN HOW WE LOOK AT THAT SO THAT MEANS. I'M ALSO TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY AB BUT CAUTION AS WE GO FORWARD AND MULTIPLE. IN THIS FRIEDMAN HAD A BILL EARLIER ON ELECTRIFICATION UPSET GLAD YOU TOOK NOBODY'S COMING WITH THESE GREAT IDEAS. BUT AGAIN AS WE TALK ABOUT SIGNALS TO THE MARKET. I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT. AND HOW DO WE LOOK AT ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT OTHER TECHNOLOGIES USE [inaudible] RESEARCHING. THANK YOU SENATOR I AM A 100% IN SUPPORT OF YOUR 100%. CLEAN ENERGY ACT. AT THE SAME TIME I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE VICE CHAIR AND BY MISTER GALLAGHER. I SHARE ALL THOSE COSTS THE IMPACT [inaudible] OF HIGHER. COST SON RATEPAYERS THE FRAGMENTED MARKET. THE IMPACT OF WILDFIRES AND HOW WE ARE TRYING TO SORT THROUGH. ALL OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE WILD FIRES ARE ARE POSING UPON OUR STATE. IN OF COURSE THE ONGOING CHALLENGES OF INSURING. A LOT ELECTRICITY RELIABILITY. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE MY LAST COMMENT -- WHICH IS. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION INDICATED THAT THIS IS A LOT OF A GOAL BUT NOT NOW. AND MY RESPONSE IS IF NOT NOW WHEN. YOU NO SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD. MANY ARE SAYING THAT WE HAVE. PERHAPS ALREADY SURPASSED THE TIPPING POINT [inaudible] FROM WHICH OUR EARTH. CAN NOT RETURN. AND SO I WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK. A TO MY DAUGHTER AND TO ALL OF FUTURE GENERATIONS. TO BE OF THE SAY. WHAT DID I DO? TO HELP FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE. THE GREATEST CHALLENGE. FACING HUMANITY ON OUR PLANET EARTH. FULL RECOGNITION OF ALL. THE MAN'S CHALLENGES ARRESTED AT A CALIFORNIA'S FACING. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS. A BOLD AND NECESSARY STEP. SAVE OUR PLANET. THANK YOU OF MISTER MAY. JUST QUICKLY MISTER CHAIR HAD JUST FOR POINT OF CLARIFICATION BY MR QUIRK TALKED ABOUT DIMINISHED BEING DEFINED AS POINT TWO FIVE OR LESS. AMUSING THE IRS AS A DEFINITION IS THAT WHAT DOES THAT DIMINISH MEANS IS LESS THAN POINT TWO FIVE AND IS THAT ANNUALLY. ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT BUT THAT. SAID TO MINIMIZE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A AND THAT'S A THAT'S AN UNKNOWN NAM TO DO IT'S UP TO OF ITS ITS SUBJECTIVE THING. TO MINIMIZE I DON'T THINK IT'S OBJECTIVE BASED ON THE BASELINE XANDER FROM THE US. I'M NOT A LAWYER I'M JUST QUOTING WHAT THE COURTS HAVE DECIDED OUGHT IN GENERAL OF THEIR OTHER PRECEDENTS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IT GENERALLY MEANS A PRETTY SMALL AMOUNT THAT. ORDINARILY PEOPLE WOULD NOT NOTICE AND THAT'S BEEN REPEATED BY VARIOUS DECISIONS. I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE WHAT WOULD BE RULED HERE BUT I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF SOMETHING LIKE. A QUARTER OF PERCENT ISN'T WHAT'S DECIDED DIMINISH. SUPPOSE TO MEAN SOMETHING YOU WOULDN'T NOTICE THAT'S FROM THE LATIN. AND IT GOES TO A PREDATOR DOES NOT -- CONCERN HIMSELF WITH TRIFLES. AND THAT'S WHERE DE MINIMUS COMES FROM THANK YOU. I JERRY BROWN'S THAT THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS LATIN. WELL I WAS SURPRISED BY THAT ANSWER THANK YOU MISTER QUIRK. DOCTOR CROW THAT'LL BE HOLD ANOTHER HEARING ACROSS THE HALL. AS AND IT IT WILL BE DENIED THE DOCTOR QUIRK DOCTOR QUIRK OF COURSE COLORS -- I GUESS THAT'S WHAT IT IS TO BE A ROCKET SCIENTIST -- SO [inaudible] BUT AS SENATOR JUST WANTED TO ASK THE QUESTION -- FOR SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS BOTH SAMMY DINO COUNTY AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY -- THAT WHEN A BUILDING SOLAR LARGE SCALE SOLAR AND WIND FACILITIES I HAVE TAKEN -- FOR SOME ESPECIALLY MONTH ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY THOSE WERE LAND CONSERVATIONISTS -- HAVE FELT THAT WE'VE TAKEN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF OF BURDEN -- TO BE ABLE TO AND TO AND IN FACT SOME WOULD ARGUE HAVE DAMAGED -- ARE ARE ARE A PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LANDS WHAT WHEN YOU'RE MOVING ON THE RPF STANDARD UP THAT MEANS THERE CAN BE MORE SOLAR AND WIND. HAVE WE BEEN THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH -- THAT THAT THE TWO COUNTIES SOME OF THE WORKING WITH COUNTIES ALL OVER THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT FROM A LAND USE PERSPECTIVE WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THERE. THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION A MISTER MAYES AND THEM I HAVE NOT I CAN'T SAY THAT I SPECIFICALLY HAVE ENGAGE WITH COUNTY OFFICIALS EITHER FROM SAN BERNARDINO OR RIVERSIDE COUNTY FOR THAT MATTER. IN THE OTHER COUNTIES THAT -- MAYES SPECIFICALLY HOST -- LARGE -- UTILITY SCALE FOR EXAMPLE -- I'D BE MORE HAPPY THAT TO ENGAGE WITH YOU I I KNOW THAT SOME OF INTERNAL. CONFLICTS IF YOU WILL PERHAPS IN THE MOJAVE DESERT TO IN IN YOUR BACKYARD WITH REGARDS -- TO AMOEBA MENTAL'S -- SPACE AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OF THE UTILI SKILL SOLAR RAYS HAVE HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT. CONTROVERSIAL THE AYE AYE EGG KNOWLEDGE IT YOU KNOW I RECOGNIZE IT -- THAT WOULD SAY AM I I'M MORE HAPPY THAT THAT OTHER SPEC TO YOU AND YOU KNOW IT'S A FORMER LEADER OF OF THE REPUBLICANS ASSEMBLY MORE HAPPY TO GET WITH YOU ON MY STAFF TING ENGAGE WITH YOUR STAFF. TO TO ENGAGE IN SOME THE SENSITIVITY I'M GOING TO WHAT MS FRIEDMAN SAID -- THIS SUSAN GOODNESS SUMMER SAATCHI THIS IS A A A AN EXISTENTIALIST RIGHT NOT TO OUR SURVIVABILITY PARA AS AN ECONOMY NAM AS A AS A COMMUNITY WHAT THE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT ALIKE COME. ON BUT THEN THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE STRONGLY WE HAVE TO TO TO MOVE FORWARD BUT TO YOUR POINT -- THAT MORE NAPA TO ENGAGE WITH THE OFFLINE STUFF TO STAFF FOR PRINCIPLE THE PRINCIPLE OF A LEAD THEN TURNED UP TO YOU WHICH RISK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SENATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AYE BY. I'VE BEEN WATCHING SOME OF THAT THE DISCUSSION AND ALSO WHEN YOU PRESENTED TO NATURAL RESOURCES AS WELL -- MOVES ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THAT DISCUSSION AS WELL. I I DO ONE ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE MS FRIEDMAN -- I ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING WITH YOU ALSO AND WITH MISS FRIEDMAN IN GERMANY. CLIMATE CHANGE. WE ARE THE LEADERS AND THEY DO LOOK TO US TO SEE WHAT IT IS WE ARE GOING TO DO -- WITHOUT A DOUBT WE HAVE TO FIND THAT BALANCE BETWEEN RELIABILITY AND OF THE THE COST -- BUT WE KNOW WE HAVE TO DO THAT. BUT UNLESS WE ARE WILLING TO BE AS MR MOZER CHIU SAID TO BE. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. AND I WANT TO ADD TO WHAT MISTER MARTUCCI SAID. HE SAID IF NOT NOW THEN WHEN. IF NOT US THEN WHO. WE ARE THE LEADERS THEY ARE LOOKING TO US SO I DO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE STUFF THANK YOU MUCH HER [inaudible] YEAH. SO I DON'T GET INVITED TO ANY OF THOSE THINGS SO AND THIS IS PROBABLY WHY BECAUSE OF THE THING AND GARY TO SAY NOW. IS THE AND I'LL AYE MY COMMENTS WITH GALLAGHER AND AND MR GARCIA I I THINK IF WE CARE ABOUT RENEWABLES WE SHOULD TREAT THEM ALL SPECIAL. AND I THINK THAT THOUGH THERE ARE ISSUES WITH BIOMASS AND GEOTHERMAL THAT WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED AND THEY THINK THAT WHEN WE SAY WE GIVE A SIGNAL TO THE MARKET YES LEGISLATION GIVES A SIGNAL TO THE MARKET. BUT YES LEGISLATION GIVES A SIGNAL TO THE MARKET BUT WE ALSO SUBSIDIZING THAT GIVES A SIGNAL TO THE MARKET. TOO SOON WE SUBSIDIZE SOLAR WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF BIOMASS AND SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES I DON'T WORK A LOT IN ENVIRONMENT I WORK A LOT AND ENERGY AND EIGHT DEATHLY WORKING POVERTY. AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE SUFFERED TREMENDOUSLY FROM PLACES LIKE CALPINE CLOSING. WE HAVE WE HAVE A COMMUNITY THIS COMMUNITIES WE HAVE NOT TAKEN CARE OF AND THERE IS ENERGY POVERTY AND I COME FROM A COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE THEY CAN HAVE SIX HOLES IN THE SIX HOLES IN THEIR SELLING FOR LIGHTS AND THEY PUT TO WIN BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THEIR ELECTRICITY. SO. I REALIZE WE STATES TO MINIMIZE BUT I THINK IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE MINDFUL OF ALL COMMUNITIES WHETHER I MEAN I HAVE FOR TREASON MY COMMUNITY LET'S BE HONEST BIOMASS SHOULD NOT BE ONE OF MY MAJOR ISSUES. HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT THAT WE SHOULD TAKE ALL COMMUNITIES WE REPRESENT WE WE WE LEGISLATE WITH HOME IN MIND BUT WE DO RIGHT REPRESENT THE WHOLE STATE AND I DO THINK. THAT WE HAVE BEEN -- UNFAIR TO SOME RENEWABLES AND I WOULD JUST ASK THAT AS YOU MOVE FORWARD THAT YOU TREAT ALL WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR LEGISLATION THAT YOU TREAT OLIVER NOBLE SO SPECIAL. AND REALIZE THAT THAT'S THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE LEGISLATION BUT IT IS HOW WE TRULY TREAT EFFORT RENEWABLE. OR ANY OTHER MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO TO COMMENT HEARING ON SENATOR I THINK THAT. IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN CLEAR THAT YOU'VE CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY. OF FOR THIS LEGISLATURE BUT NOT JUST LEGISLATURE THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEYOND. TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS IT MEAN TO GET TO A 100% WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. WELL HOW DO WE DESIGN A PATHWAYS TO GET THERE AND UNDERSCORING MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE WE ARE DEALING WITH. A THREAT TO THE WAY THAT WE LIVE THAT WAY THEY ARE GO EVEN OUR EXISTENCE. AND SO TO THAT UNDERSTANDING OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT'S THAT WHO WHAT IT'S DOING. A TO THE PLANET. WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF INITIATIVES THAT CALIFORNIA CAN UNDERTAKE? AB THIRTY TWO S. B.. THIRTY TWO YOUR S. B. THREE FIFTY THESE ARE ALL PART OF CONVERSATIONS THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN WE'RE TIMELY AND LATE IN PLACE -- MARKERS THAT SORT OF GAVE US AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO EFFECTIVELY. OF MOVE INTO THE FUTURE AND SO START TO ESTABLISH OF STRATEGIES THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED THE LARGER ISSUE AT HAND. AND IN SO DOING. AND IN SO DOING WE BECAME RECOGNIZED AS A WORLD LEADER. THOSE ARE TOUGH DECISIONS WHEN THOSE BILLS WERE PASSED. THE SAME TYPE OF OPPOSITION WAS AT THE TABLE BASICALLY SAYING THAT THESE ARE GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT GOALS TO ATTAIN. TO BUT WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND WE ARE STILL MOVING FORWARD AS WAS POINTED OUT BY ONE OF THE TESTIMONIES THAT DESCRIBED. WORK IN PROGRESS UNDER THREE FIFTY AND NOW WE'RE SETTING A NEW MARKER. BUT I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT I THINK IT IS ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE NOT STOPPING. WITH SP ONE HUNDRED AND ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL CHALLENGES. I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE OR REAL FIRE LIABILITY IT'S REAL -- DEPARTING CUSTOMERS IT'S REAL SO THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE REALLY DEALING WITH SOME SERIOUS ISSUES AND I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT. HOW WE ADDRESS HYDRO THE VICE CHAIR HAD A BILL EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED -- IN THE CATEGORY OF RENEWABLES WE UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ARE AREAS THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE. TO TO EXPLORE AND I THINK AND WHAT YOU HAVE SAID AND WHAT I HEARD THE EARLIER TESTIMONY AND COMMENTS FROM DOCTOR THE DOCTORS EGGMAN AND QUIRK -- IT DAVID MAKER COMMITTEE VERY SMART WE APPRECIATE THEIR PARTICIPATION BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THERE ARE STILL. OPPORTUNITY IN THE FUTURE TO START TO BE TO REAL REALLY DRILL DOWN. ON MANY OF THESE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING RAISED TODAY RIGHTFULLY SO [inaudible] LAST WEEK. WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF DIRECT ACCESS. AND RAISING THE CAP ON THAT BECAUSE WE GOT IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CHOICE BUT IN SO DOING WE MAY HAVE PUT OURSELVES IN A INTERESTING PLACE OF WHETHER NOT THAT WOULD CAUSE AN INCREASE TO RATES. SO WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE SOME DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT ARE BEFORE US AND WE KNOW THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING. A COMPREHENSIVE GOOD JOB. OF BEING MINDFUL TO THE END GOAL AND THAT IS REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THAT ARE LEADING. TO THE CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE US. AND SO IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY -- I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS CONVERSATION [inaudible] CONTINUING -- WHATEVER NEW JOB YOU HAVE DOWN THE ROAD YOU'LL COME BACK AND CONTINUE. TO LINEAR INSIGHT TO WHAT WILL BE DEALING WITH IN THE FUTURE WHICH IT DOESN'T STOP. WITH THIS ACTION TODAY IT CONTINUES AND TO MISTER GARTH. GARCIA IS POINTED ALSO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HE WAS ADDRESSING AND ON MISTER GALLAGHER'S COMMENTS -- WE RECOGNIZE THE CAPACITY OF BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS -- CENTRAL PROCUREMENT. AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE A A STRATEGY OF HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD IS GOING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD AS WELL. AND SO WE EVER THANK YOU. FOR NOT BEING PART OF THIS LARGER DISCUSSION OVER THE YEARS AND WE KNOW THAT THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME YOU'LL MAKE YOUR WAY TO THIS COMMITTEE WAS LEGISLATION -- DURING YOUR TENURE AS A SENATOR AS A LEGISLATOR. A SO LET ME JUST SAY THANK YOU. OF FOR ALL YOUR BOLD. POSITIONS AND YOUR BOLD STATEMENT AND YOU'RE WILLING TO STEP OUT IN FRONT AND AND DEAL WITH THE TOUGH ISSUES AND COME UNDER SOME CRITICISM AND COME UNDER SOME REAL. QUESTIONS THAT REQUIRE ALL OF US TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER. AND I THINK THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED VERY CLEARLY. WHAT THIS IS DESIGNED TO DO? AND WHAT IT STILL CREATES OPPORTUNITY FOR US COLLECTIVELY TO ENGAGE ON AS WE GO FORWARD. TO MEET THAT. VERY IMPORTANT GOAL OF GETTING TO A 100% RENEWABLE. SO WITH THAT -- YOU THE FLOOR IS YOURS FOR YOUR CLOTHES. THERE'S A MOTION ON THE FLOOR HAS BEEN SECONDED -- TO PASSED THE MEASURE -- TO THE FLOOR ME MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR YOUR YOUR KIND -- YEAR -- PERSON DEEP FELT AND AND ELOQUENT WORDS -- YOU ALWAYS BEEN A A TRUE GENTLEMAN AND AND AND AND A WONDERFUL LEADER REPRESENT YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN PASADENA NOW IS THE CHAIR. OF OF UTILITIES -- HERE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. I'M I WANTED MY COLLEAGUES HERE OF A BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. LET ME UNDERSCORE A POINT I MADE EARLIER. I'LL BE GONE. AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. THAT BEING SAID -- ILL BE UP. TO THOSE MEMBERS WHO SIT ON THIS COMMITTEE AND THE FEW OTHER MEMBERS WHO DON'T SEEM IN THIS COMMITTEE WHO HAVE BEEN SORT OF SELF IDENTIFIED AND IDENTIFIED BY THE PUBLIC AT LARGE IS IS LEADERS IN THIS SPACE. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO SP. ONE HUNDRED IN THE LARGER CONTEXT IS ACTUALLY. SMALL WITH IN REGARDS TO LOT OF OTHER FACTORS THAT THE COMING ULTIMATE CAN BE UP TO THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY AFTER I'M GONE.

THE OBJECTIVE WITH REGARDS TO MOVING FORWARD A RENEWABLE ENERGY IS TO REDUCE RATES NOT TO INCREASE RATES AYE BUT THERE'S BEEN LITTLE. OR PERHAPS A LOT OF CONFLATION IF YOU WILL. AS FOR THE REASONS WHY SPECIFICALLY SOME RATES HAVE ACTUALLY INCREASED AND SOMETIMES WHEN WE MIGHT THE MODEL IT UP TOGETHER AND AND DO WHAT -- KINDA LIKE A WHAT I CALL FLOOD IN THE MORE HAPPY DID TAKE IF YOU LIKE. WE CERTAINLY CREATE FEAR. THEN YOU CAN CREATE DOUBTS. YOU KNOW YOU FUND IT UP. YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT'S UP WHAT'S WRONG YOU KNOW WHAT'S BLACK WHAT'S WHITE.
