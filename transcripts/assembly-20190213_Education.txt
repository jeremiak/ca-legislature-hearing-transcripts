ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE INFORMATIONAL HEARING. OF ENTITLED PROMOTING MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS FOR ALL STUDENTS TO ORDER -- WELCOME TO THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION SEPARATION HEARING ON MENTAL WELLNESS FOR ALL STUDENTS -- WE KNOW THAT TOO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE SUFFERING FROM TRAUMA DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND ARE NOT RECEIVING THE NECESSARY SUPPORT [inaudible] AND TREATMENT. THIS ISSUE WAS HIGHLIGHTED DURING LAST WEEK'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF RECENT WHILE FIGHTERS AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS ON STUDENTS AND THE ON GOING NEED. FOR SUPPORT BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE DISASTER. THE IMPACTS OF TRAUMA AFFECTS STUDENTS ABILITY TO SUCCEED ACADEMICALLY AS WELL AS OUR OVERALL HEALTH. AND WELL BEING AND CERTAINLY THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS. TODAY'S HEARING WILL HIGHLIGHT THE SCOPE OF THIS NEED AND DISCUSS WAYS THAT SCHOOLS AND COUNTIES CAN WORK TOGETHER TO EXCESS AVAILABLE FUNDING. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY HAVE THAT CONVERSATION TODAY AND BEYOND FOR SURE ABOUT HOW SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES. CAN WORK TOGETHER. I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE JOINING ME TODAY I THINK. RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST MISTER KILEY THE THE END OF THIS COMMITTEE WAS A THEY PURCHASE OF YOU YOU BROUGHT THIS TOPIC TO ME AND SAID HEY WE NEED. TO WE NEED TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN. ALONG THOSE LINES AND I THINK MISTER KILEY MAY WISH TO MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS. I YES THANKS VERY MUCH AND ONE TO THANK CATCH CHAIR O'DONNELL WE GET. I THANK CHAIRMAN DON ALL OUT AND COMMITTEE STAFFER WILL HER WITH ME TO PUT TOGETHER THIS HEARING AROUND VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. FACING THAT OUR STUDENTS AND AND OUR SCHOOLS. YOU KNOW IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THAT TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS PARENTS ABOUT MY DISTRICT ONE TOPIC THAT CONSISTENTLY ARISES AS AN AREA OF NEED IS MENTAL HEALTH. AND STUDENT WELLNESS IN OUR K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM. A REVIEW OF THE RESEARCH ON THE TOPIC ALSO THE PROBLEM HAS BECOME SO CUTE YOUTH SUICIDE RATES ARE RISING NEARLY EVERY YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. AND ARE NOW AT THEIR HIGHEST LEVELS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX THAT SEVEN POINT NINE SUICIDES FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AGES FIFTEEN THROUGH. TWENTY FOUR IN RURAL CALIFORNIA OR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE MOST LIMITED THE SUICIDE RATE IS OFTEN TRIPLE. THE STATE AVERAGE. CALIFORNIA'S MOST RECENT HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY. FOUND THAT 34% OF ELEVENTH GRADERS EXPERIENCE CHRONIC SINUS AND 16%. HAVE SERIOUSLY CONTEMPLATED SUICIDE. AND THE STATISTICS DON'T EVEN INCLUDE STUDENTS RECOVERING FROM TRAUMA THEY EXPERIENCED IN OUR RECENT WILDFIRES AS A CHAIR O'DONNELL MENTIONED. NOW WHETHER NUMEROUS FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THESE TRENDS. IT'S HARD TO DENY THE PERVASIVENESS OF SOCIAL MEDIA AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASES. IN CYBER BOWLING BOWLING. UNFORTUNATELY IT CALIFORNIA DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE PREPARED TO RESPOND TO THESE ALARMING FRIENDS. ACCORDING TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY'S MOST RECENT GETTING DOWN TO FAX REEF ON MENTAL HEALTH IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS CALIFORNIA RANKS AT OR NEAR THE BOTTOM NATIONALLY. FOR STUDENT ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WELL I BELIEVE THIS ISSUE MAY REQUIRE ACTION OF THE PART OF THE LEGISLATURE I WANTED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION TODAY. TO HELP US DETERMINE THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM AND DISCUSS THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION AS WE MOVE FORWARD A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT CAME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. LAST YEAR -- THAT WERE WELL MEANING -- OF THAT PRESS THE ISSUE FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES REQUIRING -- CERTAIN NUMBERS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WITHIN DISTRICTS WITHIN SCHOOLS -- BUT I YEAH I WANTED TO HAVE THIS HEARING IN PART TO SEE WHAT SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS ARE ALREADY DOING BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT THAT GREAT THINGS BEING DONE AT SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE COULD THEN GET A BETTER SENSE. OF WHAT WORKS WHAT'S BEING DONE WELL WHAT'S ACTUALLY I HAVE AN IMPACT IN REACHING STUDENTS WHO ARE IN NEED AND WE CAN USE THAT AS A BASIS TO GUIDE POLICY MAKING GOING FORWARD. I'M ALSO SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT LOCAL EDUCATION -- AGENCIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS FACE WHEN IT COMES TO ACCESSING FUNDING AND WORKING WITH COUNTIES TO SERVE STUDENTS. IS THE SOLUTION TO SIMPLY PROVIDE ELEAZAR WITH MORE INFORMATION INCREASE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN COUNTIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS. OR STRUCTURAL BARRIERS EXIST THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN ASSIST IN BREAKING THROUGH I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PARTICIPANTS FOR BEING HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS. THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY IN MY DISTRICT FOR COMING TO SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCES AND PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON ADDRESSING THESE PROBLEMS TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS ENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS NEEDS ARE BEING MET THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY OF MISS WITH THE JEWISH TO COMMENT -- I JUST WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AS I'VE TOWARD MY DISTRICT AND HAVE NOW MET WITH ALL OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS I INVOLVED IN OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS RESOUNDINGLY. THE ISSUE OF SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING OF OUR STUDENTS -- IS PARAMOUNT TO THEM AND HOW WE FUND THESE PROGRAMS AND BEGIN TO COORDINATE SYSTEMS OF OF CARE AND COVERAGE IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT SOME FIVE OR DOING THIS. THANK YOU -- WILL TURN OUR FIRST PANEL OUR FIRST PANEL ON MENTAL HEALTH YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH AND INVITE OUR TWO SPEAKERS TO COME FORWARD. AND THERE ALLEN ALEX BRISCOE ALEX BRISCOE. YOU MAY COME FORWARD THANK YOU. AND YOU MAY PROCEED ONE RIGHT AFTERNOON [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. ASIDE LIKE TO BEGIN BY I THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC -- I'M GONNA IN TWELVE MINUTES OR LESS -- REAFFIRM TO YOU THAT THE CRISIS IS REAL THROUGH SOME DATA THAT'S VERY SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA. THANK NOT TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLE. WHERE ONE COUNTY AND A SERIES OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ADDED TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN TO CARE OVERS OVER TEN YEAR PERIOD? AND CREATED UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND TO FIND SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE SUCCESS. BUT THEN I'LL ANSWER THE DIRECT QUESTION THAT THE MEMBER JUST BEFORE YES THE CHALLENGES ARE STRUCTURAL AND WE WILL NEED ACTION. TO CREATE A MUCH BROADER. ACCESS TO CARE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. SO -- THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF DREAMING IN THIS NEXT TWELVE MINUTES AND THEN THERE'S A LOT OF DEEP MEDICAID FINANCE. BUT AT THE HEART OF THIS CHILD OF THIS NARRATIVE THAT I'M GONNA GIVE YOU IS THINK A LITTLE BIT LIKE PEANUT BUTTER PEANUT BUTTER AND CHOCOLATE. THE NEXUS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC EDUCATION IS RIGHT AND GOOD AND REAL. THE CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE PUTTING BEFORE OUR LOCAL CHILD SERVING SEEKING THAT'S ARE TOO SIGNIFICAN TO BE OVERCOME. GIVEN THE CURRENT RESOURCES AVAILABLE. AND BY WAY OF LEGITIMATION. I BEGAN MY CAREER. AS A THERAPIST IN THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I WORKED AS AN EMERGENCY ROOM SOCIAL WORKER CHILDREN'S OAKLAND. AND THEN I LET ONE OF THE STATE'S LARGEST CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS AS THE HEALTH DIRECTOR NAMI TO COUNTY FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS. SO YOU CAN'T NAME A MEDICAID REVENUE STREAM THAT I HAVEN'T BUILT. I PERSONALLY BILLS TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DE PST MEDICARE MEDICAID. I'VE RUN AFTER HE SEES I'VE WORKED IN HOSPITALS I STARTED -- SEKHEMRE CHEESE PORTIONS OF A HOME CHILD WELFARE SO WHAT I'M GONNA AMOUNT OF TIME BUT ANY OF THAT BUT I HOPE YOU CAN FEEL BEHIND THE SLIDES ABOUT TO SHOW YOU. A LOTOF EXPERIENCE WITH PUBLIC I'M INTERESTING. DOING STUFF THAT. SO I AS QUICK EVIDENCE OF THE CRISIS I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE DATA THAT WAS PUT FORWARD IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS -- BUT IT'S REAL SOMETHING'S HAPPENING WITH KIDS WERE NOT MAKING IT UP THERE'S BEEN A 50% INCREASE IN HOSPITAL DAYS FOR TERMS NOT HEALTH BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SIX IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN NOW WHY THAT'S SO IMPORTANT IS ACROSS THE ENTIRE HEALTH CARE SPECTRUM LENGTH OF STAY MEANING DAYS SPENT IN THE HOSPITAL. ACROSS ALL DISEASE BURDENS HAS DECREASED BY ABOUT 30%. ONLY IN ONE AREA HAS INCREASED. TURNS ON HEALTH. AND THE THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE INITIALLY ABOUT A SUICIDE SUICIDE IN THE LAST DECADE. HAS LEAPFROGGED CANCER AND CAR WRECKS AS A CAUSE OF DEATH. SO GRATEFUL HERE THE DETAIL -- NEVER MIND ABOUT AT YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SWISS ACADEMIC. HE'S EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CHANGES ARE MASSIVE. AND THEY'RE GOING UNDER REPORTED. ON NAMES WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF USE NOT A HEALTH CRISIS BY ANY STANDARD MEASUREMENT. I SELF INJURY JUST DEFINED BY CUTTING SELF MUTILATION SUICIDE ATTEMPTS TWO SENATE TEMPTED SELF INJURY IS UP OVER A 100%. AND WE'RE SPENDING OVER ELEVEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. THE HARSH HARD REALITY IS THAT MOST CHILDREN IN OUR SYSTEM GET NO SUPPORT AND THOSE WHO DO GET IT. GET THE WRONG KIND TOO LATE. OUR CURRENT MODEL SAYS THAT YOU HAVE TO MEET WHAT WE CALL MEDICAL DEBT A NEST NECESSITY TO GET ACCESS TO CARE ENOUGH TO HAVE A DIAGNOSIS. BUT IF YOU GO BACK TO THE ORIGINS OF THE MEDICAID MANDATE FOR MENTAL HEALTH. GIVE TO GO BACK TO NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT. AS A QUICK HISTORY LESSON. IN 196740% OF THE YOUNG MEN WHO SHOWED UP FOR THE VIETNAM DRAFT. WERE UNFIT TO SERVE COULD MAKE IT AROUND THE TRACK COULDN'T GET OVER A FOOT BARRIER. THUS WAS BORN ONE OF OUR NATION'S MOST SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS CALL THE T. P. STT MANDATE AND WHAT IS SAID IS THAT ALL CHILDREN IN MEDICAID. GET EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO THRIVE. AND YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE THE MUSICIANS. 90% OF LOW INCOME CHILDREN GET THEIR MUSIC BUT WHAT WE DON'T WE ALSO KNOW ABOUT MEDICAID OR MENTAL HEALTH IS THAT ONLY 4% OF CHILDREN GET A MEDICAL SERVICE. THE BARRIERS TO GETTING ACCESS TO CARE ARE LARGELY BECAUSE OF THESE ISSUES REGARDING MEDICAL NECESSITY WE REQUIRE CHILDREN TO MEET IN ON A REASONABLE STANDARD. TO GET ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEM THEY HAVE TO FILL INTO IT TO GET ACCESS TO CARE. SO SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN THERE'S BEEN A 20% INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN MEDICAID ANOTHER POORLY UNDERSTOOD THING. THREE MAJOR POLICY DRIVERS LED TO THIS THE INCLUSION OF THE UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN FULL SCOPE MEDICAID SB. SEVENTY FIVE THE ROMAN ELIGIBILITY EFFORTS OF THE ACA WE BROUGHT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY ELIGIBLE OUT. AND THE RULING IN THE VESTIAN. MEANING THAT NOW ALL CHILDREN UNDER 2100% OF CHILDREN 50% OF OUR PARTY QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID. SO JUST THINK FOR SECOND THAT'S OVER SIX MILLION OF CALIFORNIA'S TEN MILLION CHILDREN. ARE FEDERALLY ENTITLED. TO ALL THE SERVICES THEY NEED TO PREVENT HARM. ONLY 4% ARE GETTING ON OUR CURRENT MEDICAID THE WHOLE SYSTEM -- THAT'S AT LAST BLUEPRINT THE BOTTOM -- SO THIS DATA JUST QUICKLY SHOWS YOU THAT THE SAME BENEFIT THAT COVERS ACCIDENTS RIGHT THAT SAME NUMBER I GAVE YOU 90% OF KIDS GET THEIR AMOUNT AND I'M IN OUR SHUTTLE TIME. THE ONLY 4% OF GETTING MANY OTHER MEDICAID NOW SERVICE. OUR SYSTEM BY ANY STANDARD MEASURES BROKEN. AND WE CAN'T DO IT THROUGH HOSPITALS. OR THROUGH CLINICS THAT'S WHY I SAY THE MEDICAL MODEL IS NOT THE ANSWER. 75% OF MENTAL ILLNESS MANIFESTS BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR BUT FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS HAVE THE LOWEST RATE OF HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION OF ANY DEMOGRAPHICALLY. SOME TALKING US INTO WHY SCHOOLS ARE SO ESSENTIAL. SCHOOLS ARE THE CLINIC OF THE FUTURE FOR TEENS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HURTS YOUNG PEOPLE THEIR MOBILITY FACTORS WHAT TAKES THEM TO THE HOSPITAL IT'S ALMOST ALL BEHAVIORAL IN NATURE? LOCAL YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HEALTHY. WHAT THEY NEED IS BEHAVIORAL SUPPORT AND THE PLACE TO GET IT TO HIM IS SCHOOLS -- THE REST OF THE DAY ON THE SLIDE JUST SHOWS YOU THE PROVIDER SHORTAGE CHALLENGES WE HAVE YOU CAN'T DO IT THROUGH TRADITIONAL MEDICAL MODELS. SCHOOLS ARE PERFECT PLACE TO DELIVER THE SERVICES. AS A QUICK EXAMPLE WHILE I WAS THE HEALTH DIRECTOR ON THE ACCOUNTING WE DID ONE OF THE MOST THE LARGEST EXPANSIONS OF CHILDREN AND HEALTH IN THE STATE'S HISTORY -- WE'RE ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE FOR FOR FOURTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS FIVE SELFLESS. AND JUST A QUICKLY TAKE YOU THROUGH THIS EXPANSION. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND ONE WE HAD ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND KIDS IN OUR SYSTEM WEAK CHRIS -- TO TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND I'M ABOUT TO TELL THE STORY NOT TO SUGGEST IT'S A BLUEPRINT FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE HAD SOME THINGS ALAMEDA COUNTY THAT MOST COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE. PROVIDER BASE IN A GROUP OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS READY WILLING AND COMPETENT TO SERVE. WE HAD A PROGRESSIVE BOARD SUPERVISORS WHO HAD ACCESS TO ASSESSMENT REVENUE LOCAL SALES TAX ON TOBACCO REVENUE SO THINGS THAT MOST COUNTIES DON'T HAVE. BUT I'M I WANT TO TELL THE STORY BECAUSE IT CAN BE DONE WITH WILL AND RESOURCES MOST COUNTIES DON'T HAPPEN THOUGH. IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WE HAD FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS IN TWO THOUSAND WE HAD EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND FOR WE HAVE TWELVE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE HAVE. FOURTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND TEN WE HAVE NINETEEN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE HAD TWENTY SIX IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE HAD TWENTY NINE AND CAN CURRENTLY WE OPENED TWO HUNDRED SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. IN OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WE CREATED THE FIRST MAJOR URBAN SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH ON EVERY MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS. THERE'S A CLINICIAN IN EVERY SCHOOL. AGAIN THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY THE BLUEPRINT BECAUSE WHAT WE ADDED THOSE TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN TO CARE WE REQUIRED EACH ONE OF THEM HAD A DIAGNOSIS TO GET ACCESS TO CARE. AND I CAN TELL YOU HAVING REPRESENTED A VERY SMALL CHUNK OF THOSE TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE KIDS I SERVE WE'RE NOT PATHOLOGICAL. THE REGION WITH ADVERSITY. THEY'RE DOING WITH THE CHALLENGES OF GROWING UP. SO WE NEED TO RE WORK OUR SYSTEM SO MORE KIDS ARE QUALIFIED INELIGIBLE. AND ENSURE THE RESOURCES IN FINANCING ARE AVAILABLE AT LARGELY AT SCHOOL SETTINGS. OF THOSE TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN WE ADDED TO CARE OUR SYSTEM THROUGH SCHOOLS. SO JUST TO CLOSE WHERE I THINK THE REFORM SYSTEM NEEDS TO GO ALSO TO GIVE ACCESS TO THE TYPE OF DOLLARS AND EXPERTISE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED WE NEED TO MAKE SOME FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS. TO OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT'S WHY I ASK FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT. THE FIRST WE HAVE TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL LEVEL FEDERAL REVENUE. CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY EIGHT IN THE NATION AND SPENDING FOR MEDICAID BENEFICIARY. A SET ONE MORE TIME CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY EIGHT IN THE NATION AND SPENDING. THE FIN FIN YEAR OF PROGRESSIVENESS OF OUR STATE EVAPORATES QUICKLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT KIDS ACTUALLY GET. SO WE NEED TO BRING IN NEW FEDERAL REVENUE. THROUGH SOMETHING CALLED A STATE PLAN AMENDMENT I WON'T GO INTO DETAILS HERE BUT CLEARLY MAXIMIZING FEDERATION IS ESSENTIAL THE STATE CAN'T FOR THE BILL. WE HAVE TO BROADEN ACCESS TO SERVICES MEANING WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE THINGS WE DO AS BEYOND JUST A FIFTY MINUTE THERAPEUTIC SESSION. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF HERE'S WHAT ARE THE ROLES OF PARA PARTNERS WHAT IS THE ROLE OF EXTENDERS OR NON TRADITIONAL PROVIDERS OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH SUPPORTS? THE TRADITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS A LOT TO LEARN FROM THE RECOVERY COMMUNITY. TONIGHT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE GET TOGETHER BOUND ONLY BY THE COMMON EXPERIENCE OF SUFFERING. WHERE IS THE SOCIAL MODEL FOR BEING YOUNG AND BROWN IN OAKLAND FOR BEING A NEW MOTHER FOR BEING A RECENT IMMIGRANT? WE NEED TO THINK OF OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM IS BEYOND JUST A CLINICAL SUPPORT BUT AS A BROAD SOCIAL MOVEMENT TO BUILD SOCIAL CAPITAL. AND FINALLY HAVE TO PURCHASE HOW WE PAY. AS THE HEALTH DIRECTOR SAT ON THE BOARD OF HEALTH PLAN. WE SERVE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS. WE HAD EIGHT FINANCE STUFF. THE MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT THAT I AM HELPED A MINISTER OR LEAD. WE SERVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WE HAD A HUNDRED FINANCE STUFF. THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN THAT COUNTIES ARE BEING ASKED TO BEAR. TO ADMINISTER THESE DOLLARS IS SO MUCH GREATER ON THE BEHAVIOR OUTSIDE THAT IS ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH SIDE WE HAVE TO CHANGE HOW DOLLARS FLOW FROM THE STATE. TO COUNTIES TO MAKE IT MORE STREAMLINED AND TO EXPAND ACCESS TO REVENUE. AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS HUGE BUT THAT'S THE WAY SCHOOLS WILL GET WHAT THEY NEED. IS BY TRANSFORMING HOW THE STATE ADMINISTERS ITS MEDICAID PROGRAM. SO MY LAST SLIDE IS WE HAVE NEW SCIENCE AND EMERGING PRACTICES. SO TOUCH ANYTHING BUT HARRIS IS JOINING THE LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE WE ARE NOW UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF ADVERSITY ON HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT. WHY ISN'T ADVERSITY THE TRIGGERING ABOUT FROM A WHOLE SERVICE NOT PATHOLOGY? RIGHT BUT TOUGH THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU IF YOU NEED SUPPORT. THEY'RE STRIKING EVIDENCE OF A CRISIS YOU ALREADY KNEW IT THANK YOU FOR YOUR DATA. THERE IS AN ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE WE HAVE DRAMATIC INCREASING% COSTS IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN A MENTAL HEALTH. AND I BELIEVE THERE'S A WAY TO FINANCE REFORM BY CLEANING ADDITIONAL FEDERAL REVENUE ON WHAT THE STATUS ARE SPENDING. I'LL START MY COMMENTS -- GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MY NAME IS TOBY EWING I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION I TOO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THIS ON AND TO HER KILEY APPRECIATE THE CHANCE LAST YEAR TO WORK WITH YOU. ON SOME LEGISLATION AROUND TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- WERE AND WHERE STATE AGENCY WERE AN INDEPENDENT BODY IN SOME WAYS WORK INTO SORT OF A MENTAL HEALTH GRAND JURY FOR THE STATE. WE'VE GIVEN YOU SOME WRITTEN TESTIMONY AND SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVE UNDER WAY. I I WOULD AGREE WITH MISTER BRISCOE THAT THE CRISIS IS VERY REAL AND AND WE SEE THIS ARE COMMISSIONER SEE THIS. IN ONE OF THE MOST OF THE GLARING EXAMPLES HIS CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS KINDERGARTEN TALKING ABOUT SUICIDE WHEN I WHEN I WAS GROWING UP I DON'T RECALL THAT HAPPENING. THAT JUST SO SHOCKING TO MY CONSCIENCE TALKING WITH TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. WE GET PHONE CALLS EMAILS LETTERS PEOPLE APPROACH US IN COMMUNITY FORUMS AND TALK ABOUT. THE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO ACCESS SERVICES WE SEE THESE CHALLENGES IN TEACHERS WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING TO HELP STUDENTS ACADEMICALLY WHEN THEIR NEEDS WHAT'S GETTING IN THE WAY OF THEIR ACADEMICS ARE NOT ACADEMIC ISSUES. BEHAVIOR HEALTH ISSUES THEIR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE HEAR FROM TEACHERS WHO WANT TO RESPOND BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW. WE DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE THE PROGRAMS IN PLACE FOR THE STRATEGIES IN PLACE. QUITE OFTEN WE GET ASK WELL HOW'S CALIFORNIA DOING IN THIS REGARD AND I AND I WOULD I ALWAYS START OFF WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE. THE MIDDLE HOW SERVICES ACT HAS A COUPLE OF COMPONENTS HERE THAT ARE VERY EXPLICIT. UNDER A PREVENTION STATEMENT IN THE MAIL HOW SERVICES ACT THAT INCLUDES A STATEMENT ABOUT REDUCING SCHOOL FAILURE. THE STATE RECEIVES BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE GOING TOWARDS PREVENTION KINDS OF ACTIVITIES. THAT SAYS PREVENTING SCHOOL FAILURE IS ONE OF OUR CLEAR GOALS. WE ALSO HAVE LANGUAGE IN THE LAW THAT SAYS COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED TO BE INNOVATIVE AND YOU'VE HEARD A LOT I THINK IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS ABOUT HOW. COUNTIES ARE ARE OR ARE NOT SPENDING FUNDS EITHER IN THEIR PREVENTION SIDE OF THE RENOVATION SIDE. THE REAL ISSUE HERE I THINK IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF TOOLS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT MISTER BRISCOE HAS HIGHLIGHTED. WE ALSO HAVE HOPE IN THAT WE HAVE PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS THE STATE IT ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE GONNA HEAR LATER TODAY FROM AMY MILLER FROM MONTEREY COUNTY WE WERE ABLE TO VISIT SOME OF HER PROGRAMS. WE'RE SEEING PROGRAMS IN MONTEREY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE BAY AREA THAT ARE SHOWING TREMENDOUS PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN SCHOOLS. AND THEY'RE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERS FRESNO IS RECENTLY INVESTING IN AT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT. ALAMEDA COUNTY IS DOING. BUT WE SEE SOME FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES AND WE WE SEE THAT QUITE OFTEN THE EXAMPLES OF THE ALAMEDA OR THE MONORAIL OR SALMON YOU KNOW RIVERSIDE. OFTEN ARE WORKING UPSTREAM THE STATE MAKES IT OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT I I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM. DOCTOR MILLER AROUND THE CHALLENGES THE WRIST THAT SHE TAKES IN TRYING TO DESIGN A STRATEGY THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN HER SCHOOLS. WHAT? WE ARE DOING A NUMBER OF THINGS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE AND THERE'S I THINK WE'VE GIVEN YOU A LIST OF SOME OF THOSE THINGS. WERE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SIR EDUCATION TO SEE IF WE COULD LINK EDUCATION DATA AND MENTAL HEALTH DATA TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN PLACE TODAY UNDERSTAND HOW. ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IS SUPPORTING EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD LEARNING COLLABORATIVE'S ACROSS COUNTIES WHEN WE TALKED COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS. ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE THING STILL TELL US IS THEY HAVE A VERY HARD TIME FINDING OUT WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING. IN A VERY HARD TIME FINDING OUT HOW TO DO THE THINGS THAT THEY WANT TO GET DONE SO EVEN WHEN WE HAVE LEADERSHIP AND SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES THAT WANT TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES. IT FEELS OVERWHELMING. PART OF THAT FOR THE FOR THE COMMISSION IS WE'RE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES IN A NUMBER OF WAYS AND I'VE OUTLINED SOME OF THAT IN MY TESTIMONY. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE SEE IS MENTAL HEALTH IN SCHOOLS FALLS BETWEEN SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN THAT WE HAVE IN STATE GOVERNMENT. HAVE THE PART OF EDUCATION THEY HAVE A ROLE WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES THEY HAVE A ROLE THE COMMISSION HAS A ROLE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS A ROLE. THE OFFICE OF HEALTH INFORMATION INTEGRITY HAS A ROLE IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE LEGAL -- BARRIERS THAT GET IN THE WAY OF OF INFORMATION SHARING AND COLLABORATION ACROSS THIS COUNTIES ORGANIZATIONALLY. WE'RE NOT SEEING THE STATE BE THAT CHAMPION TO HELP COUNTIES UNDERSTAND WITH THEIR SCHOOL PARTNERS WHAT THEY CAN DO HOW TO DO IT AND AND IN WAYS THAT ARE COST EFFECTIVE RIDE. THIS THIS SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WE'LL HEAR FROM DIRECTORS YOU'LL HEAR LATER SAY I HOPE ABOUT HAVING TO SWIM UPSTREAM. IT CAN BE TWICE AS DIFFICULT TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MESSAGES AT LEAST I HERE. IN MISTER BRISCOE'S TESTIMONY. CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE THE TRUST AND RESPECT THAT FAMILIES HAVE FOR THEIR SCHOOLS PARTICULARLY TEACHERS. WHEN WE TALK WITH CONSUMERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS QUITE OFTEN THAT TRUST BECAUSE OF STIGMA ISN'T THERE WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM? IN SOME CASES A VERY CLEARLY YES BUT WE'VE HEARD FROM FAMILIES WHO SAID I'D BE HAPPY TO GO TO MY SCHOOL TO ACCESS SERVICES I'D BE HAPPY TO ASK MY NEIGHBOR TO GIVE ME A RIDE THIS IS AN ACTUAL STORY FROM MONTEREY. HAVE A FAMILY THAT DIDN'T HAVE A CAR THAT WAS RECEIVING SERVICES TO THE SCHOOL AND THEY'RE ABOUT TO SAY COULD YOU GIVE MY MYSELF AND MY CHILD THE RIGHT AT THE SCHOOL FOR SCHOOLS. FOR A FOR A SCHOOL ACTIVITY LOT OF PRIDE AND TRUST AND RESPECT THEIR WHERE THEY WOULD NEVER SAY I NEED A RIDE TO A MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC BECAUSE OF STIGMA. PARTICULARLY IN AND CULTURAL COMMUNITIES NOT YET FIGURED OUT HOW TO SUPPORT THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS AND OUR SCHOOLS. IN WAYS THAT YOU'RE SEEING IN ALAMEDA SO WE SEE THESE POCKETS OF EXCELLENCE BUT MOVING THOSE LESSONS FROM A AND AN EXCEPTIONAL EXPERIENCE IN A PLACE AT A POINT IN TIME. INTO A STRATEGIC INITIATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT. THE FISCAL INCENTIVES ARE MISALIGNED INFORMATIONAL INCENTIVES ARE MISSION LA I MISALIGNED. A GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE IT HIGHLIGHTED IN MY TESTIMONY IN MY FAMILY I HAVE AND MY COUSIN HAS A CHILD WHO WAS STRUGGLING TO GET MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND WAS TOLD TO WAIT UNTIL HE WAS ELIGIBLE FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES. THE HE WAS THE MY FAMILY WAS SORT OF PUSHED IN BETWEEN THE SCHOOLS AND THE COUNTY WITH BOTH SIDES SAYING THAT'S NOT MY MY RESPONSIBILITY YET. LET'S WAIT FOR THIS CHALLENGE TO GET WORSE TO GET MORE EXPENSIVE ONE OF THE MESSAGES IN MISTER BRISCOE'S TESTIMONY TO GET MORE EXPENSIVE. UNTIL WE CAN'T AVOID RESPONDING WE REALLY NEED TO TURN THAT AROUND. WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT BY SUPPORTING COUNTIES IN TERMS OF BUILDING LEARNING COLLABORATIVE'S WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT IN TERMS OF CREATING INCENTIVE DOLLARS TO SUPPORT COUNTIES IN SCHOOLS COMING TOGETHER WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT. IN TERMS OF LEVERAGING EXISTING DATA. WERE TRYING TO WORK WERE WORKING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AROUND OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATION TO REALLY SHAPE HOW COMMUNITIES THINK ABOUT THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN IN NEW SO THAT INCLUDES THE SCHOOLS BUT NOT JUST THE SCHOOLS AND COULD OTHER PARTNERS. SO AS MUCH AS I THINK TODAY FROM THE DATA THAT MISTER BRISCOE'S PRESENTED. THIS FEELS LIKE A VERY HEAVY LEFT AT THE SAME TIME I WANT TO SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE SOME PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES OUT THERE AROUND THE STATE WOULD BE HAPPY TO HELP YOU SEE SOME OF THOSE. BUT BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. WITH THE WAY WE STRUCTURED FUNDING TORY SYSTEM QUITE OFTEN ARE LEGAL RULES TO ACTUALLY TAKE THOSE EXAMPLES AND MOVE THEM TO SCALE WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S TOUGH TO DO. BUT RECOGNIZING THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE THE LEADERSHIP IN THE COMMUNITIES ARE LEADERSHIP AND OUR SCHOOLS THE FUNDING THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT PROVIDES AS WELL AS THE THE THE MANDATE FOR PREVENTION AND AND INNOVATION WE THINK IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE. WE'D LOVE TO HELP YU THINK ABOUT WAYS TO ACCELERATE THAT WE HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT THAT SOME OF THOSE ARE LAID OUT IN THE TESTIMONY -- AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY REALLY WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE AND HELP YOU THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN. BETTER SOONER FASTER CHEAPER. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU BOTH AND OFFER YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR SOME QUESTIONS. AND I JUST WANNA KNOW THE PRESENCE OF DOCTOR WEBER -- DOCTOR WOULD. AND MISTER MCCARTY -- WHO MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU AS WELL I MIGHT MY QUESTIONS MAYBE A LITTLE GENERAL -- I CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT AT AT THE SCHOOL SITE LEVEL I'M NOT SURE THE SCHOOL SITE SHOULD BE BUILDING THE CAPACITY. TO DELIVER THOSE SERVICES I THINK THIS. FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE SO THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT THAT EXPERTISE THAT SPECIFIC. EXPERTISE -- AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER -- YOU KNOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS CROSTINI PROTOCOLS WHAT WHAT WHAT DID I DO WHEN I SAW STUDENT AT I THOUGHT WAS STRUGGLING LIKE I TOLD THE COUNSELOR. AND I'M NOT ALWAYS SURE THAT THAT COUNSELOR HAD AVAILABLE PROTOCOLS. WHERE WHERE THEY DO RIGHT THERE THEY'RE USED ACADEMIC COUNSELING TYPICALLY OR MAYBE SOME SO YOU KNOW A SOME? SOME ISSUES THAT AREN'T SO HEAVY IS AS A MENTAL ILLNESS SO MAYBE YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT BUT I THINK WE'LL BE DONE HERE A LOT TODAY IS TO FIND THE PROBLEM. AND WE'RE GONNA HEAR ABOUT SOME EXAMPLES BUT I WANT TO HOW WE DO THIS I WELL THE BILLING SYSTEM WELL. YOU KNOW WE WANT ELEAZAR TO BE ABLE TO BILL RIGHT RIGHT FOR FOR FOR MEDI CAL. HEALTH RELATED SERVICES SO THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I WANT TO GET I WANT TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC MAYBE YEAH I THINK THE NEXT TWENTY MAY WISH. TO RESPOND TO THE SAME QUESTION BUT I WANNA KNOW HOW IT GETS DONE ON THE GROUND HOW. DOES A SCHOOL DISTRICT. FIND A PROVIDER -- BILL FOR THOSE SERVICES HOW DOES ALL THIS HAPPEN ON THE GROUND. NOW I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME EXAMPLES BUT I WANT I'M MORE INTO THAT. I'VE HEARD KIND OF THE PROBLEM TO FIND AND WE'RE HERE SO EXAMS WELL ON I'M I'M MORE INTERESTED IN HOW. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION -- I HEARD ON NPR ON THE WAY UP HERE THAT THE HEART OF THE SO -- THAT THAT QUESTION SO I HEARD A QUESTION IN TWO PARTS ONE IS THE SPECIFICS OF OPERATIONS HOW DOES IT LOOK LIKE THIS NEXUS OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION. SOMEONE ANSWER THAT THE SECOND IS HOW TO PAY. FOR ACOSTA FINANCING MECHANISM SO THE FOR SPECIFICALLY SO THE FIRST ONE AND WE LEARNED. WITH A LOT OF COLLABORATIVE -- WITH BLOOD ON THE GROUND SO TO SPEAK. OF TRYING TO MERGE THE CULTURE OF OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION WE LEARNED THE HARD WAY OVER MANY YEARS AND WHAT WE LEARNED IS YOU HAVE TO BE REAL SPECIFIC. SO IN EVERYONE OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE PROGRAMS THAT I'M OUT FOR YOU. THERE IS WHAT'S CALLED A COORDINATION OF SERVICE TEAM MEETING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN EVERY WEEK IT'S GONNA COST TEAM SOME JURISDICTIONS CALL CARE TEAM. BUT WHAT IT IS IS A DEFINED PROTOCOL FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO NEED ACCESS TO SUPPORT. THAT'S NOT JUST THE WISDOM AND SKILL OF A PARTICULAR COUNSELOR. SO THERE IS A SPECIFIC PROTOCOL FOR HOW PART OF THE CONTRACT. BETWEEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THE COUNTY AND THE PROVIDER. SO TO YOUR OTHER QUESTION IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WE USED A PURCHASED OR PROCURED MODEL. MEANING WE WOULD WORK WITH A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION LIKE A SENECA A LINK IN FRENCH FRENCH AND EAST BAY AGENCY FOR CHILDREN. A NONPROFIT ENTITY THAT WAS CONTRACTED. TO THE MEDICAID AGENCY WHICH IN THE COUNTY IS THE PAPER OUT THE PARK. SO THE SUGGESTION I WOULD MAKE IS THAT IN MANY COUNTIES THE WAY TO DO THIS IS TO WORK WITH A TRY PIE CHART TRIPARTITE AGREEMENT. THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AUTHORITY YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND YOUR PROVIDER. NOW THERE ARE MANY JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE PROVIDERS IS NOT EXIST IN THAT CASE THE DISTRICT HAS TO BECOME THE PROVIDER. SO IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU GET THERE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO IT -- AND NEITHER ONE'S OWN YOU KNOW BOTH WORK -- BUT THE DETAILS OF THE OPERATION ARE YOU HAVE TO DEFINEYOUR REFERRAL PROTOCOL YOU HAVE TO HAVE A COST TEAM. AND WHAT WE SAID IS YOU HAVE TO BE ON CAMPUS FULL TIME SO NO DROP AND THERAPISTS LIKE IT TO BE THERE ALL THE TIME. SO MANY QUESTIONS REAL QUICK ON THAT ONE DAY. SO -- SIX FIVE HUNDRED TO UNDER FIFTY STUDENT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL YOU WANT A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL IN THEIR FULL TIME -- AT LEAST. ONE IN FACT WHAT I WOULD SAY FROM A PANEL PERSPECTIVE FOR SO IT THE FINANCING DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF THOSE KIDS THAT ARE MEDICAID ELIGIBLE BECAUSE THERE'S A FINANCING REALITY RIGHT YOU GOT TO HAVE. A PAIR. SO -- IF IF IF THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED MEDICAID KIDS IN THE SCHOOL -- YOU SHOULD GET A SPLIT BETWEEN TWO TO FOUR FULL TIME PROFESSIONALS. TURN MEDICAID HOW HOW I WIND UP GETTING A FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT. CALLED E. P. S. T. T. STANCE EARLY PERIODIC SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC TREATMENT IT'S THE NAME OF THE FEDERAL BENEFIT. FOR MENTAL HEALTH FOR CHILDREN IN MEDICAID. SO TO FLIP OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ANSWER. IT'S TO MAKE REAL. THE FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT ALL CHILDREN IN MEDICAID ENJOY. BUT ARE NOT CURRENTLY GETTING. BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF A SERIES OF WELL INTENTIONED -- BUT ULTIMATELY DISASTROUS POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY THE SENATE STATE SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR SO. SO. THE STATE LAW THAT IS CREATED THIS HURDLE OR FEDERAL LAW. OR PADELL FEDERAL LAW CREATES A BENEFIT OKAY OUR STATE HAS FAILED IN KEEPING THE PROMISE GET. BY DOING WHAT. FIRST BY CARVING OUT BEHAVIOR HEALTH FOR MENTAL HEALTH IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR TO SOMETHING CALLED THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN BE WAIVER. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT MEDICAID AS A HEALTH BENEFIT. YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH IS ADMINISTERED BY A MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION. YOUR MENTAL HEALTH. IS ADMINISTERED BY YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PLAN. THAT'S YOUR COUNTY. SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN THE WAIVER. AND CREATED THE COUNTY CARVE OUT. I HAVE TO GO BY HOPE THIS IS USEFUL BUT THIS IS YOU GOT OF THE THERAPIST AND YOU SAID YOU HAD A LOOK BACK TO GO FORWARD. JUST UNDERSTAND HOW WERE CONSTRUCTED. AND CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAID PROGRAM. BEHAVIOR HEALTH ME MENTAL HEALTH ENOUGH ON DRUG ADMINISTERED BY THE COUNTY PLANS PHYSICAL HEALTH ARE MISTER BY YOUR MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. MET SO THERE IS A PRIVATE PLANS ARE PUBLIC LANCERS BOTH IN CALIFORNIA. WE CREATED THIS CAR OUT. AND THEN WE FOR MANY YEARS FUNDED ALMOST NOTHING FOR CHILDREN. IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE LEGAL ADVOCACY OF CAN DAHLE SHEA AND AND HELP AND PATRICK GARDNER YOUNG MINDS ADVOCACY IN OTHERS. THERE WAS A LAWSUIT IN THE LATE NINETIES THAT SAID THE STATE IS NOT MEETING ITS OBLIGATION. THUS WAS BORN THE EPS TO T. BENEFIT. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME COUNTIES GOT MONEY TO SERVE KIDS BEGINNING IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. NOT COINCIDENTALLY TIMED WITH THE EXPANSION THAT I SHOWED YOU UP ON THE ON THE POWER POINT. TO BEGIN THE LATE NINETIES EARLY TWO THOUSANDS COUNTY AND MEDICAID MENTAL HEALTH THROUGH EPS DUTY. SOME I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT HISTORY UNKNOWNS DETAILED BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE BIFURCATION OF THE MIND AND BODY IN CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAID PROGRAM. COUNTY IS THE MAIL HEALTH PLAN. MEDICARE MANAGED CARE THE FIFTH OF THIS IS A HEALTH PLAN. AND HOW IT'S BEEN FINANCED -- AND COUNTIES HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN THE RESOURCES AND THEY'VE BEEN CREATED AND THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN THAT I BELIEVES ON REASONABLE. SO THE WAY FORWARD TO GIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO DO THE WORK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS TO REFORM. THE MEDICAID PROGRAM IN MENTAL HEALTH. AND GIVE KIDS THE RESOURCES THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO UNDER FEDERAL LAW [inaudible] SO -- CAN I CAN A LOCAL SCHOOL I'M SORRY THE KIND OF LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT BELT BILL CAN ALLEY A BILL. WHO WHO THEY BILL YEAH SO THERE'S -- SOME TO SOME GREAT WORK FROM C. T. A AND THE NURSES THERE'S BEEN A NEW BILLING MECHANISM SO I'M. AND I'M AGAIN I HOPE THIS IS USEFUL BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET A MEDICAID DOLLAR. THERE'S BASICALLY THREE WAYS TO GET YOUR BILL YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PLAN. YOUR BILL YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH PLAN OR YOUR BILL THE STATE DIRECT. AND THE LA A IS HAVE TWO WAYS TO GET MONEY FROM THE STATE DIRECT. FOR MENTAL HEALTH YES FOR FROM HEALTH CARE PERIOD BECAME THE FIRST IS L. E. A ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES WHICH MEANS FOR ALL THE WORK IT DOES TO HELP KIDS GET ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM TO CONNECT THEM TO CARE. BUT IT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO BILL IT'S HARD IT'S ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE IN OAKLAND OAKLAND GOT A ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND VALLEY A MEDICAID ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES AND WE SPENT OVER FORTY MILLION. OF THE PSG MOUTH SO NOW WE MáS SMALL. THERE IS NEWLY AGAIN THROUGH THE ADVOCACY OF ITS CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES ASSOCIATION THE SCHOOL NURSES. THERE HAS RECENTLY BEEN MOVEMENT THAT WILL ALLOW ELEAZAR TO BILL MEDICAID DIRECTOR SOMETHING CALLED THE L. EAT A BILLING OPTION PROGRAM HOW WE A. B. O. P.. AND THAT EXISTS. THAT THAT'S A NEW. I WOULD ARGUE AGAIN THOUGH THAT IT'S A DIFFICULT AND BURDENSOME PATHWAY TO BRING RESOURCES TO THE TWO AT THE SCALE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. REMEMBER THOSE THREE SOURCES I TOLD YOU GET MEDICAID CAN GET IT THROUGH THE ALLEY A OPTION. YOU CAN GET YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PLAN WE GET IT THROUGH YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PLAN DOES THE BASICALLY THE THREE WAYS YOU GET ACCESS TO MEDICAID. I THINK THIS ELLIE A STUFF IS TOO SMALL TO MATTER AT THE SCALE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND THAT IS WE HAVE THE BEST CELL WHY THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE OR WHAT YEAH BECAUSE THINK OF MEDICARE LIKE A POT OF GOLD IN DC YOU GET A DOLLAR IF YOU PUT UP A DOLLAR. SO. WHEN I LIAISE BILL MEDICAID THEY STILL HAVE TO PUT UP THE DOLLAR TO GET THE DOLLAR? SO THAT'S ASKING DISTRICTS TO INVEST YOUR MONEY AND EVEN WHAT'S ONLY FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR IT'S FIFTY CENTS MORE THAN I GOT. I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO STOP ASKING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BE THERAPISTS AND DOCTORS LET THEM EDUCATE. BUT THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO ITS OP IT'S MEET ITS OBLIGATION AND BY THE WAY THEY HAVE A LOT MORE MONEY. SO THAT'S WHY YOUR HEARING IN MY OPINIONATED STATEMENT -- THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE PATHWAY FOR TO BRING RESOURCES TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT SCALE IS NOT TO FORCE THEM INTO THE ALLEY A BILLING PLAY -- DISTRICTS WILL DO IT AND SOME WILL BE SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL AT IT BUT I THINK IT'S FOOL'S GOLD. THE REAL WAY TO BRING THESE TYPE OF SERVICES TO SCALE ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES IS TO FILL THE EPS TT MANDATE. THAT WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN THAT OUR STATE HAS FAILED TO DELIVER. THANK YOU AND WE MAYBE. DEBBIE THE CONSULTANT WHO WHO HANDLES THIS MATTER MAYBE I'M SURE USE YOU'VE HAD INTERACTION OBVIOUSLY BEFORE BUT I I THINK WHAT WE NEED IS IS THE DETAIL WHICH YOU JUST DELIVERED. A QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE WE KEEP SAYING WHERE IS IT WHERE IS IT WHERE IS IT WE KEEP WAITING AND CLEARLY THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT IS NOT CONNECTING YOUR AND THAT'S CERTAINLY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. BUT EVEN OVERALL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE SCHOOL SITE LEVEL LISTEN I COME FROM HIGH SCHOOL FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS I'M SURE YOU CAN EMPLOY A FULL TIME DOCTOR PLUS. FOR JUST THAT HIGH SCHOOL SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU BUILD IT THERE WHAT IS IT THAT HOW DO YOU BILL HOW DO YOU GET. THIS DONE BECAUSE EVER SINCE THIS BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S HAPPENING SO WE MOVED SOMEHOW WE NEED TO CONNECT THESE TO THESE TO VENTURE SOME SORRY SIR AT ALL TO CHAIR I WOULD AND I WOULDN'T WILL NOT DISAGREE WITH MR RISCO I WOULD ANSWER THE QUESTION A BIT. DIFFERENTLY I I THINK THAT -- IN SOME SCENARIOS THAT SOLUTION IS A VIABLE SOLUTION BECAUSE OF THE NUMBERS BECAUSE OF THE CAPACITY BECAUSE OF THE WORK FORCE RESOURCES AS HE SAID. ALAMEDA HAD SOME SOME SOME EXTERNAL IN OF RESOURCES RESOURCES OTHER THEY COULD DRAW THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK IN ALL TERRACE. AND AND SO THE QUESTION OF HOW DO WE DO THAT HOW TO SUPPORT THAT WHAT WE'RE FINDING A LOT OF SMALLER RURAL COMMUNITIES AS THEY'RE FIGURING IT OUT THERE THIRD BUILDING THESE PARTNERSHIPS THEY'RE CAUGHT IN ITS ITS THE PICKING UP THE PHONE AND ARE CALLING THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH TRACK. AND SAYING HEY HOW DO WE MAKE THIS WORK AND IN ALL TERRACE THIS THAT MENTAL HEALTH STAFF ACTUALLY. SEE SEE CONSUMERS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL THEY WERE THEY WALK ON THE CAMPUS BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL TOWN BECAUSE THEY CAN BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO FEW PEOPLE THIS RELATIONSHIP FOR THEIR WHERE WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR IS. HOW CAN THE STATE FACILITATE MANY PASSED TO GET THERE CLEARLY THERE ARE SOME STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF FINANCING SOME COMMUNITIES WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND PUT THOSE RESOURCES? IN PLACE TO EXACTLY AS ALAMEDA HAS DONE. BUT IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT MIGHT NOT WORK FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN IN IN SANTA CLARA FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE MAKING A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TO CREATE. A WHAT'S WHAT'S CALL THAT IT'S AN INTEGRATED USE MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH PROGRAMS TARGETING. YOUTH FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE SO TRUMP RECALL TRANSITION EIGHTIETH AND THEY'RE DESIGNING THIS USING HIM TO SAY INNOVATION FUNDS TO SERVE EVERY USED IN THE COUNTY. THAT CAN COME IN REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT IT HOW DOES NOT HAVE MEDI CAL HAS KAISER INSURANCE. AND SO WHAT WHAT WE'RE BEGINNING TO LOOK AT IS HOW CAN THE STATE FACILITATE MULTIPLE PATHS SO THAT WE CAN DESIGN STRATEGIES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THIS FOR THE SCENARIO. IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WERE ALSO TRYING TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTUREIN TERMS OF USING ADMINISTRATIVE DATA TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WORK FOR HOME IN WHAT COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WAY IS. IT MAY BE THAT IN SOME PLACES THE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CLINIC IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. FOR OTHERS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE LEAVING SCHOOL BUT MIGHT NEED CONTINUOUS CARE THEY MIGHT NOT WANT TO GO BACK TO THEIR HIGH SCHOOL AT NINETEEN OR TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE TO CONTINUE THAT SERVICE. SO I THINK WHILE NOT DISAGREEING SUGGESTING THAT. ONE SIZE DOESN'T NECESSARILY FIT ALL. BUT WHAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW DO WE ARRAY FISCAL INCENTIVES. PROGRAMMATIC SUPPORT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND OTHER STRAIGHT LEADERSHIP STRATEGIES AROUND DATA AROUND REGULATORY RULES SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE EXPERIMENTATION AND INVESTMENTS IN THE STRATEGIES THAT SCHOOLS AND COUNTIES COULD WORK OUT TOGETHER. IN WAYS TO DO EXACTLY WHAT MISTER BRISCOE'S CALLING FOR THAT THEN LEAD TO CHANGES IN HOW THESE COMMUNITIES CAN ACCESS DOLLARS. SO THAT THE DOLLARS ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE STRATEGIES NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. THANK YOU ENOUGH TO THINK THANK YOU FOR THE DETAILS. APOLOGIZE TO COMMITTEE FOR TAKING OF THAT AMOUNT OF TIME BUT I FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS ARE THERE OTHERS THAT WAS TO COME A DOCTOR WOULD. YEAH. FIRST ONE NOT AN EDUCATOR -- I'M A I'M A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. AND BUT A COUPLE THINGS STRUCK ME AS YOUR TO IT'S SYSTEM SO -- WHICH IS SOMETHING WE ENCOUNTER HAS PROVIDERS SO WITH YOUR DENTIST OR PHYSICIAN IT'S IT'S IT'S CUMBERSOME IT'S DIFFICULT -- IS IT I GUESS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS A DIFFICULT. ARE YOU ARE THERE A LOT OF DENIALS -- BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU MAY. WITH -- FORMER CONGRESSMAN PATRICK KENNEDY YESTERDAY TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF GETTING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITH YOUR TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE PLAN WORK. OFTENTIMES THE DENIAL RATE IS MUCH HIGHER THAN IT IS IN OTHER KINDS OF CARE AND SO I'M CURIOUS IS THAT IS THAT PART OF THE ISSUE OR IS IT A TECHNICAL ISSUE OR BECAUSE A LOT OF YEARS. YEAH SO I'M FOR AGAIN I BUT BY WELCOME THIS QUESTION AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THE DETAIL -- IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN EVEN EXAMPLE FROM THE PHYSICAL HOW SPACE CAMP IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX IF YOU HAD MEDICAID IN CALIFORNIA. YOU HAD A CAR THAT SAID MEDICAID AND HAD FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICARE. I WAS LIKE HAVING A TICKET TO NOWHERE BECAUSE NO ONE WOULD TAKE THE RATES RIGHT. SO CAN BASH A AND OTHERS AT THE STATE. MEET IS BRAVE DECISION THAT SAID LOOK IF PEOPLE CAN GET ACCESS TO CARE WE GOT A CHANGE HOW WE PAY. SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WENT THROUGH THIS TRANSFORMATION CALLED MEDI CAL CONSOLIDATION WHICH IS A FANCY TERM FOR THE MOVEMENT TO MANAGE CARE. SO WE WENT FROM 90% OF PEOPLE IF YOU FOR SERVICE TODAY 90% OF PEOPLE MANAGED CARE. WE CAN BRING BEHAVIOR HEALTH WITH US. IN FACT WE DID EVEN WORSE THAN THAT. IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. YOU HAVE TO BILL PER MINUTE. PER UNIT. PER PATIENT PER DIAGNOSIS. SO THINK FOR SECOND IF YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE IS A PEDIATRICIAN SHE RUNS A NUCLEAR SF GENERAL. HOW YOU GONNA DIAGNOSIS TWO YEAR OLD? WHEN THEIR MOMS ANXIETY DEPRESSION IS WAS REALLY CAUSING THE BEHAVIOR CHALLENGE? SO WE HAVE CREATED A A REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM THAT'S DRIVEN BY PATHOLOGY WITH THE UNIQUE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN. BEHAVIOR HEALTH IT'S HARDER TO BUILD THAN ANYTHING A PHYSICAL HEALTH BAYLOR HAS TO BILL. YOU KNOW I'VE RUN AFTER IT SEES. I'VE FILLED HOSPITAL COST REPORTS I EACH OF BILLING MEDICAID MENTAL HEALTH. IN FACT 55% OF THE TIME THAT CLINICIANS SPEND 55%. IS SPENT BILLING. SO ALL THE SHOULD THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE SHORTAGES OF CHILD PSYCHIATRIST. NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF THEM BUT WE'RE HAVING TO SPEND MORE THAN HALF THE TIMES ON A PAPERWORK. IT'S INSANE. SO IT AGAIN I WOULD INVITE YOU THAT IF WE WERE GONNA DO ONE THING. WE'D REFORM HOW MEDICAID BEHAVIOR. IS STRUCTURED AND REIMBURSED. AND I KNOW THAT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE FAR AWAY FROM THE NEEDS OF A TEACHER BUT IT'S NOT. IT'S WHAT'S GONNA STOP US FROM BRINGING THE SERVICES TO KIDS ON CAMPUSES EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THEM AND THEY SHOULD BE GETTING TO YOU SHOULD BE GETTING THE THERE'S A QUESTION. YEAH SADLY S.. AND LIKE I'D LIKE TO ADD ON TO THAT THAT THE CHALLENGE IS DOESN'T GET EASIER BETTER ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE. NOW. SO THAT IF. IF YOU HAVE A CHILD TODAY IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. WHO IS EXHIBITING EARLY SIGNS OF PSYCHOSIS? UC DAVIS RUNS. SOME OF THE BEST PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTY AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER PSYCHOSIS CLINIC FOR PEOPLE WITH PRIVATE SECTOR INSURANCE. AND EARLY PSYCHOSIS CLINIC FOR PEOPLE WITH MEDICARE NOW YOU WANT YOUR CHILD IN MEDI CAL. THE QUALITY OF THE CARE WHAT'S COVERED. RIGHT PART OF THE REASON WHY WE'RE PUTTING ALL THIS PRESSURE. ON THIS PUBLIC SYSTEM IN SOME WAYS IS BECAUSE WE'VE ALSO. WELL WE'VE SEEN TREMENDOUS ADVANCES IN THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT YOU CAN GET THROUGH THE PRIVATE MARKET WE'RE NOT SEEING THOSE ADVANCES. ON THE BAY FOR A WHOLE SIDE. RIGHT WE WE HAVE SO IT'S NOT JUST ON THE MEDI CAL SITE IS HARD TO FIND THE PROVIDER BECAUSE THE BILLING IT'S HARD. IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE WITH PRIVATE SECTOR INSURANCE AS WELL. AND SO I SO I I WANT TO CONNECT THESE TWO BECAUSE MANY OF THE CHILDREN WERE TALKING ABOUT HALF PRIVATE INSURANCE. WE'RE NOT SEEING THE PUBLIC SYSTEM WHETHER IT'S A COUNTY OR A CONTRACTOR WHOSE FOR SERVING THOSE CHILDREN ACCESSING THE FUNDS. THAT THE FAMILIES PAID INTO IN TERMS OF PREMIUMS TO MAKE SURE THEIR CHILDREN ARE GETTING CARE SO THERE'S DISCONNECTS BETWEEN WHAT PEOPLE NEED CHILDREN NEED. AND THE PUBLIC DOLLAR AND THERE'S A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT PEOPLE NEED AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR DOLLARS WHILE. WHAT I HEARD YESTERDAY FROM A FORMER CONGRESSMAN WAS THAT -- THE DENIAL RATE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IS HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER SERVICE PROVIDED -- IN MEDICINE. THAT THAT WAS. WHAT HE PERCEIVED AS A NATION WIDE SO I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA -- BUT IF IT'S ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THAT IT'S IT'S PRETTY DISTURBING. AND IF IF I COULD MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT AT IF 60% OF THE KIDS ARE MEDICAID AND FEDERAL ENTITLED THIS BENEFIT. IN A ONE SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO FOLLOW MY RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS TO ACTIVATE THE H. YES AND REQUIRE THE STATE GIVE YOU A PLAN. TO MEET THE THE THE DETAILS THE MANDATE. ON THE PRIVATE SIDE YOU DO HAVE A LEVER. THE FEDERAL PARITY ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ESSENTIAL BENEFIT PACKAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REQUIRE THAT PRIVATE INSURERS. OFFER THE SAME ACCESS TO BEHAVIOR HEALTH AS THEY USED AS WEALTH. WE AS A STATE ARE LATE TO ENFORCEMENT. SO TO ADOPT JUST TO SAY WE DON'T HAVE TO JUST LEAVE THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MEDICAID THOUGH MEDICAID'S GO IMPORTANT. AND IT'S 60% OF GETS THE THERE IS A STRATEGY FOR THE COMMERCIALLY INSURED FOLKS. TO THAT I THINK THE ELECTED TO PURSUE. AND THEN ONE FINAL QUESTION TO THIS YEAR -- DOCTOR EWING YOU TALKED ABOUT THE ALTIRIS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A UNIQUE APPROACH IT SOUNDS IT CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH THAT A LITTLE BIT WAS T IS IT WAS IT MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THROUGH THE COUNTY OR THEIR THROUGH THE CITY. THEY'RE NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BILL TO NINE I'M INTO A LOT OF SMALL TOWNS IN MY DISTRICT YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. I WENT UP THERE INSTANCE OF TIME WITH THEIR COUNTY STAFF AND THAT THEY JUST HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS IN THE SCHOOLS AND SO YEAH THESE ARE COUNTY STAFF. THEY THEY SHOULD STRUGGLE FOR TO FIND PRIVATE PROVIDERS IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND SO I MEAN IT IT REALLY IS YOU KNOW A SMALL MY FAMILY'S FROM WE'D. RIDE IS A SMALL TOWN AND AND SO IT REALLY IS THIS REALLY. WHAT WE SEE IS QUITE OFTEN RELATIONSHIP BASED STRATEGIES WHETHER IT'S IN FRESNO OR MONTEREY OR OUT TERRACE? IN SOME OF THE STRATEGIES ARE VERY MUCH ALIGNED WITH THE IDEA OF PUTTING A HEALTH CLINIC IN A SCHOOL. BUT IN SOME OF OUR SMALLER COMMUNITIES THAT'S NOT FINANCIALLY VIABLE OR THEY DON'T HAVE THE WORK FORCE. SO MIGHT MY COMMENT ABOUT ALL TERRACE IS THEY FOUND A PATH BUT QUITE OFTEN THAT GETS EXCEPTIONALLY DIFFICULT THERE'S LOTS OF WORK AROUNDS. BECAUSE THEY'RE BUMPING UP AGAINST THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULES OF THE INFORMATION SHARING OR HOW THIS INFORMATION FLOWS AND AND AND AND MY MY OVERARCHING COMMENT IS THE STATE NEEDS TO INVEST IN MULTIPLE STRATEGIES. TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR COUNTIES AND SCHOOLS TO BE SUCCESSFUL AS PARTNERS. WE HAVE MODELS OUT THERE IN OUT TERRACE IN ALAMEDA BUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T DONE IS LEARN FROM THEM PUT THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN PLACE PUT THE SUPPORT IN PLACE TO TAKE THOSE MODEL PROGRAMS. AND ACTUALLY TAKE THEM TO SCALE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE STATE IS ACTUALLY BEEN TRYING TO DO. IN WAYS THAT MAKE IT EASIER FOR THESE COUNTIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU. FOR THE COMMENTS. MISTER RATHER. I JUST A QUICK QUESTION -- FOR MISTER -- BRISCOE AND THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS THIS IS WILD THAT DOCTOR EWING YOU MENTIONED I THINK THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE TO THE FOUR MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS FOR SCHOOL FIVE HUNDRED IS THE IS TO HAVE SUCH KIND OF WANNA I'M WONDERING WHERE THAT NUMBER. COMES FROM I'M SURE A LOT OF IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF SCHOOL OR DEAL WITH WESTERN POPULATIONS DIFFERENT AGES WHAT KIND OF CULTURE THE SCHOOLS BUILT AROUND ACCESS IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES KIND OF LIKE. USING ONE SIZE DOESN'T THEY DON'T NECESSARILY FIT ALSO IS THERE RESEARCH SORT OF ESTABLISHING WHAT WHAT IS THE IDEAL RATIO -- FOR FOR THOSE SORT OF SUPPORT FOLKS. I KNOW -- AND THEY SHOULD BE IN THE FISCAL HEALTH WORLD RECALL IMPAIRMENT. MEANING THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS ASSIGNED TO A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER. pHOW MANY PEOPLE SHOULD BE PANEL PER PROVIDER. THERE'S GREAT AND GOOD DETAIL ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH PRIMARY CARE SIDE BETWEEN TWELVE HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND PATIENTS PER PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER. WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME ANNOUNCES THE NUMBER I GAVE YOU IS A FINANCIAL -- POLL MEANING FOR WHAT SIZE POPULATION COULD YOU SUSTAIN THROUGH ANY JUST EIGHTY CONTRACT. HOW MANY PEOPLE COULD YOU STAND AT ITS MY ESTIMATE BASED ON MY OWN ROUGH EXPERIENCE IN ONE COUNTY SO I I WOULD -- CAUTION YOU TO TAKE THAT I SAW DOCTOR -- ASSEMBLY PERSON OR CENTER CHOOSE BILL THE MORE MORE PEOPLE POSITIVE ADULTS IN THE LIVES OF CHILDREN THE BETTER -- BUT I THINK THAT THAT IS A ALSO A VERY HIGH BAR FROM A COST PERSPECTIVE. CANCERS I DON'T I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT NUMBERS AND I WOULD I WOULD BE WARY THAT YOU TOOK WHAT I SAID TODAY AS ANY KIND OF RESEARCH BASED. FACT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER OF BRISCOE AND DOCTOR TELL ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR I WILL NOW CALL OF OUR NEXT PANEL. OUR SECOND PANEL DEALS WITH HOW SCHOOLS ARE CURRENTLY PROMOTING MENTAL WELLNESS AMONG ALL STUDENTS AND WE'LL HAVE A MISTER MIKE LOMBARDO FROM THE PLASTER COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AND LISA EISENBERG FROM THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BASED. BASED HEALTH ALLIANCE JOIN US TODAY AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY [inaudible] YEAH. OKAY THAT WAS A LOT OF INFORMATION. FOR A LOT MORE -- CABS -- THINKING WITH SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS MIKE TOMORROW MY PLASTER COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THEY'RE AT PLUS OUR COUNTY I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR PREVENTION SUPPORTS AND SERVICES I PLAYED DOOR ROTH ALSO WITH THE STATE. AND HELPING TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PROGRAM THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT LATER. THIS AFTERNOON CALL POSITIVE BEHAVIOR INTERVENTIONS AND SUPPORTS. WELL THE LAST TWO SPEAKERS WERE TALK AND I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF CALIFORNIA SO BEFORE I LAUNCH INTO PLASTER COUNTY. I'M REMINDED THAT WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT UNIQUE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA WITH A LOT OF GEOGRAPHIC ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY. WE HAVE OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TEN THOUSAND SCHOOLS AT ABOUT. SIX POINT THREE MILLION CHILDREN THAT WERE EDUCATED NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND OR NINETY THREE THOUSAND OR SO PLASTER COUNTY. I DO SOME WORK IN ALPINE COUNTY ONE HUNDRED STUDENTS. IN THE DISTRACTOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE TO GO TO A SEPARATE COUNTY TO ATTEND HIGH SCHOOL. SO WHAT MISTER YOU AND SAID I THINK IS VERY ACCURATE THERE'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL -- MODEL OR OR STRATEGY -- OF STUDENT HER MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN -- CLINICIAN I THINK -- IN PLASTER CAN I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT NOW. WE NEED TO LOOK AT INTEGRATION WE NEED TO LOOK AT PARTNER AGENCIES WE NEED TO LOOK AT COLLABORATION. AND WHO DO WE GET TO THE TABLE AND EACH OF THE COUNTIES TO HELP MAKE A SYSTEM AND DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT'S RESPONSIVE TO OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILY NEEDS. AND PLASTER COUNTY WE HAVE A MODEL CALLED THE CHILDREN SYSTEM OF CARE. WHICH I WORKED IN FOR ABOUT TWENTY OF THE THIRTY ONE YEAR HISTORY. THAT PLUS OR SYSTEM OF CARE HAS BEEN IN PLACE I'VE BEEN ARE PROVISIONAL SIR. HI WAS ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF OUR CHILD WELFARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- I'VE RUN THE JUVENILE INSTITUTION IN PLASTER COUNTY. AND YOU MIGHT SAY I CAN'T KEEP A JOB -- BUT LAST YEAR OR A LOT ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO I MOVED EDUCATION AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN A UNIQUE WAY AM CLASS OR TO INTEGRATE OUR SERVICES. SO CLASS OR COUNTY OUR SYSTEM OF CARE AS I SAID AS ABOUT A THIRTY ONE YEAR HISTORY OF INTEGRATION SERVICES THIS IS DRIVEN BY A LEADERSHIP TEAM THAT'S PRESIDED. ARE -- THAT'S CHAIRED BY A PRESIDING JUDGE. THAT SEEMS BEEN MADE IN AT SEVEN THIRTY IN THE MORNING EVERY WEDNESDAY EVERY OTHER WEDNESDAY NOW FOR THE LAST -- WE HAD IT THIS MORNING FOR THOSE LAST THIRTY YEARS. WHAT'S THE GOAL OF COORDINATING WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER DIRECTOR OF HUMAN SERVICES THE DIRECTOR FAMILY ADVOCACY SO WE HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE ON THAT TEAM. AND OUR DIRECTOR OF CHILDREN'S SYSTEM OF CARE AND THEN STAFFED BY SUPPORT CAN HELP THIS HAPPEN. SO WAVERLY OF REALLY FIRMLY THAT NOBODY CAN DO IT BY THEMSELVES SCHOOLS CAN'T I'VE WORKED ON ALL OF THESE AGENCIES. AND SCHOOLS CAN'T DO IT ALONE THAT IT TAKES THAT INTEGRATED MODEL. IT TAKES COLLABORATION -- IT'S A HEAVY LIFT AND IT'S HARD WORK BUT I I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. OUR VALUES OUR PLACE IN THE FAMILY AT THE CENTER OF OUR SERVICES. WE VALUE YOUTH INVOLVEMENT YOU FOR USE THEIR CONTRACTS WE EMPLOYEE YOUTH WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE WE IMPLORE. FAMILY MEMBERS WITH LEFT EXPERIENCE WHO ARE INTEGRATED ON TO TEAMS. SERVICES TEAMS WITH CHILD WELFARE PROBATION MENTAL HEALTH -- PUBLIC HEALTH. TO HELP SUPPORT SOME OF THE FAMILIES WITH THE HIGHEST NEEDS IN OUR COUNTY. CO LOCATED SHARE DATA SYSTEMS AS I SAID I'M WITH -- EDUCATION I HAVE FOSTER YOUR STAFF THAT ACCESS OR CHILD WELFARE INFORMATION SYSTEM. SO THEY DON'T NEED TO WAIT FIVE DAYS TEN DAYS TO HAVE A SOCIAL WORKER RESPOND THEY CAN GO AND SAY THAT THIS CHILD WAS DETAINED. WHERE THEY LIVE AND HOW DO WE GET SUPPORT FOR THAT STUDENT IN SCHOOL TODAY OR HOW DO WE TRANSPORT THAT STUDENT TO SCHOOL TODAY? SO COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES LIVING IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE MOST INCLUSIVE MANNER. KEEPING THEM SAFE HEALTH A HOME AND SCHOOL SO WE HAVE THIS HISTORY OF WORKING AT THAT LEVEL. WE HAVE INTEGRATED TEAMS THROUGHOUT OUR AGENCY -- ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO TROUT FROM TRANSIT PREVENTION THROUGH THE MANAGEMENT RANKS UP TO AS I MENTIONED THE EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM. HE HEARD FROM MR REX PRESS. I'M SORRY. BRISTOL AND SERBIA AND ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY THAT THE NEED AND I THINK YOU'VE HAD OTHER HERE AND SIGNED -- ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND THE RATE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SCHOOLS. PLASTER COUNTY -- IN AN EFFORT TO DEEPEN OUR COLLABORATION -- THROUGH FUND AND THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION NOW. AS CREATING THAT SYSTEM OF CARE THAT INTEGRATED MODEL AT SCHOOL SITES. SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TEACH SCHOOLS AND DISTRACTS HOW DO YOU CREATE A SYSTEM OF CARE MODEL AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT KOSTER THE CARE MODEL. AT A SCHOOL SITE WHAT STRUCTURES JUNAID IN PLACE WHAT COMMUNICATION AGREEMENTS WHAT INFORMATION SYSTEMS. AND WHO NEEDS TO BEON THOSE TEAMS AT EACH OF THOSE SCHOOL SITES AND ITS UNIQUE IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT OUT TERRORISTS OR ALPINE AS IT IS AND PLASTERED IT MAY BE DIFFERENT AND BE TRAINED -- ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS THAT WERE WORKING WITH IN HIGH SCHOOLS WE WANT THOSE TEAMS -- INTEGRATED TEAM SYSTEM AFTER TEAM THE ECOLOGY OF THAT SCHOOL TEN OF OFF PARENTS. AS PART OF THE TEAM TO HELP MAKE DECISIONS FOCUSED ON YEARS AND DATA. SYSTEMS FOR SUPPORT AND STUDENTS AND WHAT PRACTICES CAN WE PUT IN PLACE TO HELP THOSE STUDENTS. ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMES WE WANT TO SAY [inaudible] WE THE LADY IF THAT. MORE ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER. SO I THINK IT TAKES A COMMUNITY AND I'VE KIND OF MADE THAT POINT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AN INTEGRATED. GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS SUPPORTING KIDS AND FAMILIES PREVENT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN A WAY THAT IS ORGANIZED. SO -- A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORTED FUNDING FOR MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT. SO WE BELIEVE THAT WORKING WITH SCHOOLS AND NEEDS TO BE AN ORGANIZED FASHION WHAT DO WE DO FOR ALL STUDENTS ACADEMICALLY BEHAVIORALLY AND SOCIAL EMOTIONALLY. HOW DO WE CREATE SYSTEMS OR WEAKENED SCAFFOLD PRACTICES TO THOSE SYSTEMS AND RESPOND TO STUDENT NAMES WHAT DO WE DO FOR ALL STUDENTS ACADEMICALLY WHAT? ARE THE EARLY LITERACY PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE THAT EVERY STUDENT HOW DO WE USE DATA TO RESPOND WHEN STUDENTS. HAVE A HIGHER NEED -- AT CHAIR TO LEVEL SUPPORTER TERRITORY LEVEL OF SUPPORT MORE INTENSIVE LEVELS OF SUPPORT. I BELIEVE THAT WE ALSO NEED TO GO AND I HAVE A A CHART ON THE LAST PAGE THAT SAYS THE THE GROWTH A POSITIVE BEHAVIOR AND INTERVENTIONS AND SUPPORTS AND CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED. TO REALLY FOCUS ON HELPING TO SUPPORT SCHOOL SITES BE MORE SAFE ADEQUATE OF ALL. CHAIR ENGAGED ENVIRONMENTS AND PHOEBE I. S. HELPS DO THAT AND ACCOMPLISH THAT CALL. YES IT'S NOW IMPLEMENTED IN OVER TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED SCHOOLS IN THE STATE. WE'VE SEEN A RAPID GROWTH OF A P. B. I. S. IN CALIFORNIA -- PART OF THE REASON IS THAT SCHOOLS ARE FIND IN THAT WHEN YOU IMPLEMENTED T. V. I. US WEST OF AFFECT EFFECTIVELY. HE HE SEE REDUCTIONS IN JUST A PLAN. AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. YOU SEE INCREASES IN ACADEMIC AND ENGAGE MEN AND THE CHIEF MATT. IMPROVE PERCEPTIONS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY AT SCHOOL. WE SEE EVEN A DECREASE IN TWO JOB SATISFACTION TEACHERS FELLOW MORE IN CASE I PERSONALLY GONE TO SCHOOL SITES AND HAD TEACHER SERVICE REJECT THIS YEARS AGO. YEAH YES HOUSE TO SUPPORT DISTRACTS TRADE AND THAT FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENT. WE HAVE CORE INSTRUCTION -- FOR STUDENTS AROUND LITERACY AND MATH WE ALSO WANT TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AROUND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND AND TEACH AND SOCIAL EXPECTATIONS SO WE CAN CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT'S MEASURABLE. WHERE THE COSTS JAMES CAN USE DATA THAN TO MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT STUDENTS NEED THOSE HIGHER LEVELS OF KERR? HI MY COLLEAGUES IN TALK MORE ABOUT WELLNESS CENTERS CAN GO A LITTLE DEEPER INTO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND I THINK WITH -- COSTER CARE TEAMS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THANK YOU. WE GIVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INVITATION -- HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS -- MY NAME IS LISA EISENBERG AND THE POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BASED HEALTH ALLIANCE WERE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION THAT PROMOTES THE INTEGRATION OF HEALTH SERVICES INTO SCHOOL SETTINGS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS A HUGE PART OF THE WORK THAT WE DO -- SO AS I MENTIONED AS THAT AND AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID WAIT VERY NICELY FOR ME I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS. WHICH I THINK -- I'M BIASED I THINK IT'S A REALLY EXCELLENT EXAMPLE. OF WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED WHEN THEIR PARTNERSHIPS -- BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY PROVIDE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF STUDENTS FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES -- JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ARE HEALTH CARE CLINICS ON K. THROUGH TWELVE CAMPUSES. THEY CAN LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE YOUR COMMUTE YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER OR DOCTOR'S OFFICE WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THEY ARE USE FOCUS. STATE OFTEN ENGAGE YOUTH AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE -- WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND THEY PRIMARILY SERVE STUDENTS IN LOW INCOME AND UNDER RESOURCE TO COMMUNITIES -- ABOUT 70% OF OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS PROVIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS PART OF THEIR SPECTRUM OF CARE. AND I WOULD SAY THAT THAT DATA POINT IS ACTUALLY PROBABLY LOWER THAN WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE FIELD I THINK IT CONTINUES TO GROW TO MEET THE NEED THAT ARE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ARE SEEN ON THE CAMPUSES THEY SERVE. ACTUALLY DID A LITTLE LOOK AT OUR DATA AND THE PERCENTAGE USED TO BE 60% OF OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS JUST FIVE YEARS AGO WERE PROVIDING BEHAVIOR ALSO WE'VE SEEN. PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. I WAS ASKED TO DESCRIBE THE MODEL OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS AND HOW THEY DELIVER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND I THINK THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THEM IS TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THE THREE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT. THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT SPONSOR OR RUN SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS -- ABOUT HALF OF OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ARE RUN BY COMMUNITY HEALTH SIR HEALTH CENTERS THESE ARE. TYPICALLY FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS -- THAT USUALLY CO LOCATE SOME LATER A NURSE PRACTITIONER OR PRETTY PEDIATRICIAN. WITH MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPISTS THESE CLINICS RARELY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO DELIVER SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. BUT MOST OF THESE CLINICS ARE CONTRACTED WITH MANIC MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE HEALTH PLANS SO THEY BILL THROUGH THOSE CONTRACTS WITH OUR MANAGED CARE. CARE PLANS IN CALIFORNIA -- ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS -- OFTEN AFFECTIONATELY REFERRED TO AS WELLNESS CENTERS. ARE RUN BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE ACTUALLY UNIQUE OUR STATE IS UNIQUE IN THAT WE HAVE A HIGH PORTION OF OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS THAT ARE RUN BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- SO THESE ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT YOU TYPICALLY USE THEIR DISTRICT GENERAL FINDS TO HIGHER SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST TO RUN. THESE CENTERS AS SPACES ON THEIR CAMPUS PRIMARILY TO ADDRESS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS OF STUDENTS. BUT OFTEN THEY LINK TO PRIMARY CARE AND OTHER CARE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN I WOULD SAY THE THIRD MODEL THAT WE HAVE -- ABOUT A HANDFUL OF OUR REMAINING SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ARE RUN BY COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES AND THEY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH THEIR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. TO PROVIDE SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE DEEP DIVE INTO A LITTLE BIT OF WHO RUNS OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS. TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT TYPE OF CARE IS PROVIDED IN OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS I WANTED TO TALK. VERY SIMILAR TO THE PYRAMID THAT -- MISTER LOMBARDO WAS TALKING ABOUT GOING FROM WIDE SERVICES ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MORE INTENSIVE SERVICES -- IN A SCHOOL SETTING SO GOING UP THAT PYRAMID ARE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ARE DOING TEACHER TRAINING AND TEACHER SUPPORT. THEY ARE OFTEN TEACHING ABOUT HOW HOW AND THERE ARE SUPPORTING TEACHERS AND IMPLEMENTING RESILIENCE FOCUSED. RESTORATIVE PRACTICES IN THE CLASSROOM HOW TO DO MINDFULNESS PRACTICES IN THE CLASSROOM TO DE ESCALATE STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AS THEY SEARCHED FOR SERVICE IN THE CLASSROOM. A LOT OF OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ARE CONDUCTING SCHOOL WIDE OR GRADE LEVEL SCREEN SO THEY MAY SCREEN AN ENTIRE STUDENT POPULATION FOR ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OR TRAUMA OR SUBSTANCE USE -- MANY OF OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS WORK WITH GROUPS OF YOUTH LEADERS AS PURE HEALTH EDUCATORS AS YOUTH ADVISORY BOARDS AND THIS IS OFTEN HOW. MANY ARE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ARE IMPLEMENTING USE MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE THERE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCE FOR THEIR PEERS IN THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY. A LOT OF OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ARE DOING GROUP THERAPY SO THEY DO YOUNG MEN'S EMPOWERMENT CIRCLES GRIEF GROUPS RESTORATIVE CIRCLES -- A VARIETY OF TOPICS TO BRING TOGETHER YOUNG PEOPLE TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES AND ADDRESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. AND THEN I WOULD SAY MANY OF OUR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS. ARE PROVIDING ONE ON ONE INDIVIDUAL CLINICAL THERAPY TYPICALLY IT'S A BRIEF INTERVENTION SO IT'S AT A LIMITED NUMBER OF SESSIONS. AND IF A STUDENT NEEDS ON GOING SUPPORT THEY REFER OUT TO A COMMUNITY PROVIDER THAT CAN BE CO LOCATED IN THE CLINIC OR LOCATED ON THAT SCHOOL CAMPUS SO THAT'S A MODEL THAT WERE SEEN GROW. THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- AS ASKED TO FINISH UP I WAS ASKED TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES ARE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS. ARE SO. FIFTEEN I THINK ONE OF THE INCREDIBLE BENEFITS OF THIS MODEL IS THAT IN LARGE PART A LOT OF THE SERVICES ARE BILLABLE AND THEY'RE EITHER CONTRACTING WITH THE COUNTY. THEIR CONTRACTING THE MEDI CAL HEALTH PLANS -- AND THEY ARE BILLION FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF THE CLINICAL CARE THEY'RE PROVIDING. I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS THAT NOT ALL OF THE CARE THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING IS BILLABLE SO A LOT OF THE INCREDIBLY TRANSFORMATIVE -- INTENSIVE -- SCHOOL AIR PROVIDING IN THERE IN THE SCHOOLS THAT THEY SERVE IS NOT A BILLABLE SERVICE SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE. IS HOW TO SUSTAIN THOSE PRACTICES. PIGGY BACKING OFF OF THAT CHALLENGE IS THERE'S NO STATE FUNDING OR STATE PROGRAM OFFICE FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU SEE ME TESTIFY YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ME TALK ABOUT NOT QUITE A BIT -- CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY THE ONLY STATE I'M WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS AND NO STATE PROGRAM OFFICE. AND I WOULD JUST -- CAN PIGGYBACK OFF OF MISTER BRISCOE COMMENTS ALAMEDA COUNTY HAS A REALLY ROBUST NETWORK OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THE COUNTY HAS PUT UP BASE FUNDING FOR THOSE CLINICS -- SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT NETWORK STRENGTHENED THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- OUR SCHOOL WHICH HEALTH IN A STRUGGLE WITH COOL SCHOOL FACILITIES AND CONFIDENTIAL SPACES HOW DO YOU IT'S IT'S AN INVESTMENT IT'S A SPACE ON A CAMPUS. THAT IS YOUTH FRIENDLY AND YOU THINK GAUGED. AND THEN I WOULD SAY THE LAST BARRIER THAT. ARE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS AND SCHOOLS BY AND LARGE ARE FACING IS THAT THEY OFTEN BECOME THE DE FACTO RESOURCE FOR MENTAL HEALTH WHEN UNDER INSURED OR NON MEDI CAL STUDENTS. CAN'T GET THE HEALTH THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO IN THEIR COMMUNITY OR FROM THEIR PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS -- SO OFTEN ARE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ARE THE ONES AND THE SCHOOLS ARE THE ONES THAT THAT PICK UP THE PIECES WHEN THEY CAN'T NETWORK CARE THEY CAN'T ACCESS CARE IN THE COMMUNITY -- I'M GONNA FINISH WRAP IT UP KEEP IT SHORT. I I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT DESPITE THOSE BARRIERS THAT ARE MENTIONED I THINK WE'RE WE'RE SEEING THE NETWORK OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS GROW. AND BE BECOME MORE ROBUST MORE AND MORE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ADD ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH% ADD ON A FAIRLY ROBUST SPECTRUM OF CARE IN THEIR CLINICS AND I THINK THAT'S A TRUE. TESTAMENT TO THE INCREDIBLE WORK THEY'RE DOING AND COMMUNITIES THAT'S REALLY COMMUNITY FOCUSED USED DRIVEN -- AND ENGAGED AND AND IS TRANSFORMING THE SCHOOL COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE SO I'M. VERY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THAT MODEL AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I THINK IT'S IT'S TRULY TRANSFORMATIVE WORK. THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY HAD A QUESTION. I DO -- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THIS IS FOCUSED ON ON THE SCHOOL SETTING SO WE NEED TO KNOW MORE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. ON THE PRIVATE SIDE THROUGH THEIR HEALTH SYSTEM WHICH DOCTOR WITH ENGAGE WITH OUR LAST PANEL ABOUT BUT OUT OF BETTER SCHOOLS BACK. IN OUR SCHOOLS ARE SO STRAPPED THESE DAYS AND CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL WHY SERVE ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ARRESTING SCHOOL FUNDING WHICH I CHAIR AND NO WE HAD SCHOOL DISTRICTS COULD BE RIGHT HERE IN THE CITY SACRAMENTO WHICH ARE. ON THE VERGE OF GOING BANKRUPT AND HAVING THE STATE. TAKEOVER SO -- OUR DISTRICTS MAKING THESE DECISIONS TO INVEST IN THESE SERVICES WHEN. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER. IN IN THEIR EYES AND THEIR CBO SIZE IMMEDIATE NEEDS AND AND ARE WE SEEING THE ARE WE SEEING THE OPPOSITE I WAS SEEING A DECREASE FROM DISTRICTS. OFFER THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY NEEDED USE THEIR EIGHTY SAID EARLIER USING THEIR KIND OF GENERAL FUND. DISCRETIONARY DOLLARS ARE. ARE THOSE BEING MORE AND MORE USED TO JUST KEEP THE DISTRICT. OF LOS. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I MEAN I I WOULD SAY THAT WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE SCHOOL DISTRICTS INTERESTED IN BUILDING OUT WELLNESS CENTERS WHICH IF THINK WE SWEETIE STRUGGLE AS A STATE ASSOCIATION TO DEFINE WHETHER THOSE ARE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS ARE NOT I THINK. THAT WE WOULD INCLUDE THEM IN OUR BIG UMBRELLA -- BUT I THINK IT'S OFTEN A LOWER BAR TO BRING IN AND DEVELOP A WELLNESS CENTER OUTSIDE OF A SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTER. I THINK -- SO WE'RE SEEN THE NEEDS GROW AND WERE SEEN AND CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN IN THIS MODEL IN THE SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTER MODEL HOW THEY'RE DOING THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT IN EVERY COMMUNITY. OFTEN. I I THINK IT. BOILS DOWN TO PARTNERSHIPS COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS OFTEN HAVE -- ACCESS GRANTS WHERE THEY CAN APPLY -- FOR ACCESS GRANTS TO BUILD SPACES TO PROVIDE MORE CARE SO IF A SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN BRING IN A PARTNER THAT CAN. THAT LEVERAGE THOSE RESOURCES THEY HAVE THAN THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT DOESN'T HAVE TO DIP INTO THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT FUNDING -- SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE BILLION LEN MEDI CAL AND REINVESTING THOSE DOLLARS IN SCHOOL HEALTH SUPPORT I THINK WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE SCHOOL DISTRICTS UNDERSTAND THAT. TO DRAW DOWN MORE FUNDING FROM THE STATE THEIR ATTENDANTS TO DRAW DOWN THOSE DOLLARS THEY HAVE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE UNDERLYING BARRIERS THAT KEEP STUDENTS OUT OF SCHOOL -- BUT YES. YELL DISTRICTS ARE CHALLENGED WITH CHALLENGING DECISIONS AND YOU SEE SOMETIMES SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE A BUDGET FOR THE SERVICES AND FOR EXAMPLE. LIKE POLICE SERVICES PUBLIC SAFETY WHETHER SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AND THERE'S DEBATES WILL ALSO YOU HAVE A SQUAD CAR SITTING OUT FRONT OR SHOULD YOU USE THOSE RESOURCES TO HIRE -- TO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THE CLASSROOM AND AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE PUBLIC SAFETY MENTAL HEALTH DEBATE AS THIS FRONT CENTER TODAY LOS ANGELES DEVOTED TO NOT DO IT COUNTY JAIL AND USE THAT MONEY FOR A MENTAL HEALTH -- PROGRAM SO I WAS SITTING IN EXAMPLES OF WHERE. THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT MAYBE WE DON'T NEED AT A THIRD SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER. CAN USE THAT MONEY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR SCHOOL COUNSELORS. I THINK WE ARE WE WE DO A LOT OF DEEP DIVE WORK IN WEST CONTRA COSTA AS AN EXAMPLE I CAN I CAN ONLY PULL IT OUT EXAMPLES WHERE WE DO. PRETTY INTENSIVE WORK IN WERE SEEN THAT THAT CONVERSATION PLAY OUT THEY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND INVEST SOME OF THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT AHLERS IN THEIR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTER SCHOOL HEALTH NETWORK SO. THEY ARE NEARLY DIRECTING IT FROM THERE. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SAY THIS EVERY YEAR REDIRECTING IT BUT THERE IS THAT CONVERSATION THAT THEY ARE HAPPY IN IN THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT FINANCING DOLLARS I COULD. DO I COULD REACH OUT TO OUR FIELD AND STATION PLAYING OUT ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. THINK IT REQUIRES -- INTEGRATED CONVERSATION AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND MYSTERY ON WAS HEADED THAT DIRECTION IN HIS CONVERSATION IT REQUIRES THAT BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE NATURE OF OUR OUR STATE IN EACH COUNTY IN EACH DISTRICT. THAT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SOCIAL SERVICES PROBATION LAW ENFORCEMENT WORK TOGETHER WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DESIGN A MODEL THAT WORKS WITH. FOR THAT DISTRICT FOR THEIR COUNTY BUT THEIR BRAIDS AS DOLLARS TOGETHER THE COMPLEXITY OF MENTAL HEALTH -- FUND AND MEDICAID MEDICARE I'LL FIND IN. IS SO UNIQUE IN EACH COUNTY AND APPROACHED IN DIFFERENT WAYS BY EACH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR I THINK YOU'LL HEAR THAT FROM DOCTOR MILLER. THAT. IT REALLY DOES REQUIRE THAT INTEGRATED -- SYSTEM TO PROBLEM SOLVE AND LOOK AT HOW ARE WE GOING TO SUPPORT OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IF IT MEANS HAVING A WELLNESS CENTER HEALTH CENTERS THE BEST MENTALITY. BUT LET IN THAT LOCAL COMMUNITY. FIGURE OUT THE RESOURCES AND HOW THEY DESIGNED THE RESOURCES AND I I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO UNDER HEALTHCARE REFORM INCLUDED -- ARE HM US IN THAT CONVERSATION AM DOCTOR MILLER AGAIN WILL GO AND AND GREATER DEPTH ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HMO IS A RESPONSIBILITIES -- COUNTY AND MEDICARE NOW FUND THEN BUT IF THOSE AGENCIES ARE NOT ALL WORKING TOGETHER. WE'RE GOING TO BE SPENT AND MORE MONEY LESS EFFECTIVE LAKE. AND IN OUR VIEW CLASS OR STARTED TO PAUL FAMILIES APART BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO TO DIFFERENT PLACES TO GET THE PROVISION OF THOSE SERVICES. THANK YOU. AND I WOULD CAUTION ANY SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR REMOVING SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS FROM ANY CAMPUS BECAUSE THEIR NECESSARY ELEMENT OF STUDENTS A I CAMERA CAMPUS OF FIVE THOUSAND THAT'S LARGER THAN SOME CITIES. IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT THERE POLICE OFFICERS LOOK AROUND OUR BUILDING. FULL POLICE OFFICERS SO I JUST BE CAREFUL I THINK THEY ARE NECESSARY ELEMENT. IN IMMEDIATE STUDENT SAFETY WHEN WHEN EVENTS GO SOUTH -- SINGLE FURTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LOMBARDO MISS EISENBERG THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WE MOVED TO OUR THIRD AND FINAL PANEL -- WHICH WILL DISCUSS THE SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES IN SCHOOL AND COUNTY AGENCY PARTNERSHIPS. AMY MILLER FROM THE MONTEREY COUNTIES BEHAVIOR HEALTH AGENCY AND JACK. WELL AS FOR A LESSON FROM THE HUMBLE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WILL JOIN US AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY WHERE I WAS GOING EARLIER SO FEEL FREE. TO PONTIFICATE ON THIS TOPIC IS AND HOW ARE THESE. ARE THESE RELATIONSHIPS BILL HOW DO WE MAKE THIS WORK WE KNOW THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD THAT DEFINE SEEN SOME EXAMPLES AND HA HA HOW DO YOU DO THIS THE IDEA MAKE IT HAPPEN DAY ONE WHAT DO YOU DO THANK YOU. THIS -- ONE SO I HAVE A HAND UP A DEVELOP FOR THE COMMITTEE I HOPE YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK SYSTEM RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME PREVENTION WORK. THE MILD MODERATE BUT THE HEALTH PLANS ARE STILL IN CHARGE OF THE MILES WHICH I KIND OF HIGHLIGHTED SPECTRUM IS GREEN -- THOSE OF YOU FAMILIAR WORKING WITH HUMANS MIGHT KNOW THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY WHO IS MILD WHOSE MODERATE AND IN OUR BUSINESS MODEL WE'RE SERVING QUITE A BIT. OF THE MILD POPULATION ARE SCHOOL BASED INTEGRATION EFFORTS. SO IN MY COUNTY WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE PARTNERED WITH LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- TO TAKE THEIR EL CAP MONEY SO THEIR LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY CONTROL MONEY AND THEY INVEST THAT -- IN GIVING THE MONEY TO US THROUGH AND USE AND THEN WE PULL DOWN FEDERAL FUNDING IS A MATCH. FOOT SO FOR VERY HIGH POVERTY SCHOOLS WE DO IT INITIALLY BASED ON THE FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH NUMBERS THEY PAY -- A SMALL FRACTION YOU MIGHT KNOW THE WAY THAT MEDI CAL WORKS AS EACH KID HAS AN EIGHT COAT. AND THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE CAN BE AS HIGH AS NINETY SEVEN CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. PEOPLE DOWN A LOT OF FEDERAL MONEY AND THEN WE JUST CHARGE THE SCHOOL FOR THE REMAINDER THAT'S ON COVERED USING THEIR AL CAPP MONEY. AND NOT SYSTEM HAS BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL RULES -- PEOPLE THIS COMMITTEE MIGHT REMEMBER THAT COUNTY BEAVER HEALTH USED TO BE IN CHARGE OF DOING THE I EP RELATED SERVICES -- THERE'S A LEGISLATIVE CHANGE OVER FIVE YEARS AGO WHERE MOST COUNTIES BROKE UP IN OUR COUNTY WE NEVER GOT DIVORCED STAY TOGETHER. KIND OF SAY WE WENT TO MARRIAGE COUNSELLING DID A LOT AND USE. AND THROUGH THAT THAT'S WHERE WE DEVELOP THAT IDEA AROUND TAKING THAT LOCAL EL CAP DOLLARS AND GET INTO KIDS BEFORE THEY HAVE AN IGP. IGP IS NOT THE BEST TIME TO INTERVENE WITH THE KIDS THEY ALREADY HAVE A PROBLEM. SO WE REALLY WORKED TO DEVELOP KIND OF THE INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS FRAMEWORK WE USE SOME INNOVATION DOLLARS SO KIND OF FROM TOBY SHOP -- AN HSA INNOVATION DOLLARS INITIALLY FUNDED -- FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO P. I. S. WHICH REALLY TAUGHT US HOW TO BE IN THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF THEIR CULTURE AND INTERVENE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE -- AND REALLY DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR THE COMMISSION SO WE HAVEN'T SCHOOLS THAT ARE MORE PRIMARY PREVENTION SO DOING SOME GROUP WORK. SOME WORK ON SCHOOL CULTURE AND SCHOOL CLIMATE AND THEN BEING ABLE TO RESPONSE TO THE VERY HIGH NEEDS KIDS WHICH ON YOUR DIAGRAM HERE I KIND OF SHOWS ARE A TIER. THREE SO OUR GOAL IN THE PARTNERSHIP WITH SCHOOLS IS TO PROVIDE AS COST EFFECTIVE SERVICES AS POSSIBLE. THE VALUE PROPOSITION I THINK THAT WE BRING TO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS AGAIN LEADING TEACHERS BE TEACHERS I THINK THEY DESERVE THAT THAT'S A HARD ENOUGH JOB -- AND THEN WE WE COMMENDED BEHAVIOR ALL SPECIALISTS. AND OUR CLINICIANS ARE TRAINED OF TRAINING A BIG INVESTMENT REALLY TO RESPOND TO WHAT MIGHT BE A MILD DEPRESSION ALL THE WAY UP TO A KID THAT BECAUSE OF AN I. P. HAS TO BE PLACED OUTSIDE OF THAT COUNTY -- INTO A RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT FACILITY -- AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE THINK THAT ISOLATED SCHOOL COUNSELORS CAN DO SO SOME OTHER BUSINESS MODELS THAT EXIST -- THAT PEOPLE ARE IMPLEMENTING ITS MORE SCHOOLS HIRING THERAPISTS. BUT WE REALLY SEE THE VALUE IN HAVING AN INTEGRATED SCHOOL TEAM. SO WE CAN INVEST IN KIND OF BALK TRAINING AND REALLY LOOKING CLOSELY AT THE QUALITY QUALITY CONTROL THE SERVICES PROVIDED -- AND THEN ALL THAT ARDUOUS MEDI CAL BILLING THAT WE LOVE TO HATE. MY TEAM DOES THAT AND THE SCHOOLS JUST REALLY -- PAYING THE DIFFERENCE SO I THINK IT BRINGS A LOT MORE MONEY INTO MY COMMUNITY WHICH IS A BIG DEAL PEOPLE THINK OF MONTEREY COUNTY AND PROBABLY YOU THOUGHT OF PEBBLE BEACH. BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHERE THE ACTION IS -- WE HAVE A A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF POVERTY IN OUR AGRICULTURAL REGION -- AND THAT'S THAT'S THE GROUP THAT WERE RESPONDING TO I THINK THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THE PRIVATE INSURANCE NETWORK. THOUGH BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE REALLY DEVELOPED A MODEL IT'S YOU CAN BE AN EXPENSIVE MODEL WHEN YOU HAVE THE COST CARS -- AND ALL THE TRAINING THAT THEY HAVE. BUT WE DON'T SEE THAT THE PRIVATE INSURANCE NETWORK IS PROVIDING THAT THE MORE FLUENT SCHOOLS -- I THINK THAT'S KIND OF A MARKET FAILURE IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S A LOT OF ANALYSIS TO DO TO LOOK AT WHAT SORTS OF STAFFING THAT THE PRIVATE INSURANCE NETWORK SHOULD BE INVESTING IN IN SCHOOLS WE KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. RIGHT SO. PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY WE WANT TO COME TO ANDREAS YEAR PROGRAM. SO YOU CAN BUT THERE'S REALLY NOTHING TO SEE IT'S THEIR BEST SOMETIMES IN CLOSETS RIGHT. IT'S BEGINNING A RELATIONSHIP EVENTUALLY THEY THEY GET ENOUGH STEAM TO GET AN OFFICE. BUT WE'RE NOT WEARING BADGES THAT SAY -- MENTAL HEALTH YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND THE SCARCITY OF SCHOOL SPACE -- WERE NOT WEARING BADGES THE SAME MENTAL HEALTH ARE AT THE JOB OF OUR THERAPIST IS TO INTEGRATE INTO THE SCHOOL CLIMATE CULTURES THERE'S NOT STIGMA ABOUT -- IF SOMEONE'S. GET ENGAGING IN THERAPEUTIC SERVICES OR ANYTHING THEY'RE WEARING SCHOOL BADGES AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE EATING LUNCH WITH TEACHERS IN THE BREAK ROOM RIGHT SO UNDERSTANDING SOME OF THE STUDENTS DOING CONSULTATION ABOUT KIDS THAT THEY'RE STARTING TO NOTICE PROBLEMS WITH. TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT EARLY EXPOSURE TO TRAUMA SERVICES TO ME ARE UNEQUIVOCALLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO WHEN I FIRST STARTED MY JOB I SAID IF I HAD A MAGIC WAND I WOULD PUT ALL OF MY CHILDREN SERVICES AND SCHOOLS. I DON'T HAVE A MAGIC WAND I HAVE SOMETIMES THE NUMBER ONE YOUTH HOMICIDE RATES I CAN'T CUT MY JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO INVEST MORE IN SCHOOL SO I'M VERY THANKFUL THAT YOU KNOW. OUR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IS REALLY PARTNERED SHOWN LEADERSHIP AND ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS TO INVEST IN US I THINK WE'RE SEEING HUGE DIVIDENDS. SINCE WE IMPLEMENT OUR PROGRAM WHERE. WE'RE DOING THAT AL CAPP MONEY WE'VE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS SERVED BY 158% -- AND SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE REALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ON NEVER BE ABLE TO REPORT SHE WAS OUTCOMES RIGHT. SO IT'S I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO REPORT TO YOU HOW MANY TIMES I'VE HAD STUDENTS THREATEN TO HARM OTHERS WERE WE'VE INTERVENE EARLY BECAUSE THERE ARE YOU KNOW pWERE GETTING INFORMATION. AND GETTING THAT KID INTO CARE I THINK THE PROGRAM IS JUST REALLY TRANSFORMATIVEIN TRULY SAVING LIVES -- I WISH THAT MORE COUNTIES WERE KIND OF AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS ALL SAY THAT I THINK THE THING THAT'S MADE THIS POSSIBLE. IS REALLY THE RELATIONSHIP IN INVESTMENTS I KNOW IT THERE'S AN EDUCATOR ON THE PANEL TODAY -- EACH SCHOOLS A DIFFERENT CULTURE RIGHT AND IN MY COMMUNITY THERE'S TREMENDOUS DIVERSITY BEING KIND OF A LARGE GEOGRAPHIC COUNTY. SO WE HAVE A FULL TIME MANAGER THAT REALLY INVEST IN DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION -- AND RESPONDING TO AND HELPING THEM WORK THROUGH PROBLEMS THAT THEY'VE GOT A REALLY DIFFICULT I E. P. WAS IT A LITIGIOUS FAMILY. MORE IN THERE IT KIND OF A HIGH LEVEL TRYING TO HELP THE SCHOOL FIGURE IT OUT. WERE ALSO DOING REALLY IMPORTANT TRAININGS AROUND TEACHER BURN OUT WE'RE DOING TRAININGS FOR TEACHERS ON MINDFULNESS IN THE CLASSROOM HOW THEY CAN IMPLEMENT MEDITATION IN THE KINDERGARTEN TYPESETTING WHICH JUST KIND OF A SORT OF ONE OF OUR ADDITIVE SERVICES BEYOND JUST IS THAT WE PROVIDE. IT'S PRETTY ADORABLE TO SEE A ROOM FULL OF FIVE YEAR OLDS MEDITATING. NO ONE'S LOSING IN THAT SITUATION.% SO -- THAT'S REALLY THE THE KEY POINTS THAT I WANTED TO SAY IS YOU KNOW THE OVERALL BUSINESS MODEL -- THERE'S JUST SO IMPORTANT TO LET TEACHERS WE REALLY GET TO BE TEACHERS AND INVESTING COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH EVEN OUR FUNDING IS COMPLICATED YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL PAYMENT REFORM AND WHAT THAT WILL DO. I THINK THE FUTURE IS REALLY TRANSFORMATIVE SYSTEM OR WE GET RID OF THAT PAPERWORK BURDEN. AND THEN MY THERAPIST THAT ARE IN THE SCHOOLS I COULD GET 30% MORE PRODUCTIVITY FROM THEM IF I COULD GET RID OF SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS -- ALL SAY THAT YOU KNOW AS A BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM WE ENCOURAGE LITTLE BIT OF RISK. BECAUSE WE'RE SERVING UP PRETTY BROAD DEFINITION OF WHO WHO WE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM BECAUSE TECHNICALLY IT'S SOME OF THESE KIDS SHOULD BE SENT OVER TO THE MANAGED CARE PLANS -- Và HAVEN'T QUITE DEVELOP THE NETWORK TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE EXPERIENCE IN THIS COLLABORATION AND MAYBE WHY -- SOME CANDIES HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THAT STRATEGIC INVESTMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY PROACTIVE OBVIOUSLY. A FIVE YEAR OLDS DOING MEDITATION HER. MISTER MISTER KILEY RIVERS YOGA. HELLO BUT IT. MISTER ROSS. BY GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JACK PEARL SI BUCKS FORMER -- KATE TEACHER DOWN IN THE BAY AREA AND THEN MOVE BACK TO HOME -- COUNTY IN NINETY SIX WHERE I'M FROM WAS HIGH SCHOOL HISTORY TEACHER.

AND THAT -- WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THE SUICIDE PREVENTION TEAM FROM STANFORD AND GOT TO FOR THERE'S NATIVE AMERICAN HEALTH SERVICE AND I DROVE SIX HOURS DOWN HERE BECAUSE WE ARE ROLE IN FACT -- BUT DON'T THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING YOUR BRIEFLY HUMBOLDT COUNTY WITH EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS GIVE OR TAKE WE HAVE THIRTY TWO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE LOOK TO THE BALKANS AN ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT MODEL AND I WOULD ARGUE WE PROBABLY. IT'S WITH FIFTEEN OR SO SUPERINTENDENT PRINCIPLES I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WITH MY SUPERINTENDENT WITH SIXTEEN HUNDRED KIDS WERE BY HUMBLE COUNTY STANDARDS A LARGE DISTRICT -- HE WAS ACTUALLY DRIVING A VAN BECAUSE ONE OF OUR KEY AIDES WHO WE PROVIDE SERVICES FOR HIS BUS DRIVER WAS SICK AND SO MY SUPERINTENDENT MISSED MY MEETING BECAUSE HE WAS PICKING UP ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS. THAT'S RURAL SCHOOLS -- OR WE IN CALIFORNIA THE EUROPE TRIED AND THE WHO BY VALLEY TRY OUR ACES NUMBERS ARE. TERRIBLE AS A GRANT WRITER RICH SOMETIMES ADVANTAGEOUS BUT OVER SORRY THAT ELEMENTARY BACKGROUND FOR MORE ACES AND ANECDOTALLY YOU GOING TO OUR CLASSROOMS YOU TALK TO OUR TEACHERS IT. CAR CARE PROVIDERS. A SOLID THIRD OF OUR KIDS ARE THE FACT THAT COMES SCHOOL IN THE MORNING YOU JUST WANNA HUG I MEAN IT'S ASTOUNDING WHAT THEY DO. ARE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY -- CINNAMON -- KILEY -- SPOKE I THINK STATEWIDE PERCENTAGE OF KIDS WITH SUICIDE IDEATION WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS FRANKLY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE COUNTY -- LAST YEAR'S SURVEY THAT THEY HAD SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED THAT DURING THE PAST YEAR -- BEING RURAL THERE IS A SHORTAGE OVERALL SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. DISTANCE IS A REAL THING. IT WAS FUNNY WHEN I TAUGHT IT SAME BIRDS IN OAKLAND WE CAN JUMP ON THE BUS AND MAKE TWO TRANSFERS AND LO AND BEHOLD I WAS AT THE OAKLAND MUSEUM. IF I WAS TEACHING ELEMENTARY IN MCKINLEY THE WORD DISTRICT OFFICES. I MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT TWO HOURS TO GET THE ONE BUS THAT THREE OR FOUR HOURS SECTION TO GO TO OUR CLERK HISTORY MUSEUM AND BRING MY KIDS THERE AND TURN AROUND AND BRING THEM BACK. FIFTY TWO MINUTES LATER BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT WORKS TRANSPORTATION IS DIFFICULT IF A FAMILY MEMBER ASSUMING HERE SHE USUALLY -- SHE CAN GET TIME OFF FROM WORK AND THEN. GET THEIR KIDS TO THE COUNSELING APPOINTMENT IN EUREKA IT'S EVEN NOT ONLY FIFTEEN MILES IT'S A DIFFICULTY IN SO WE TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT YOU KNOW OVER THREE FOUR HUNDRED OF OUR DISTRICTS IN THE STATE ARE RURAL DISTRICTS -- WE WE OFTEN LACK THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NON FORTUNATE MY DISTRICT YOURS AGO MADE THE COMMITMENT WE HAVE A STUDENTS SYSTEMS COUNSELOR AT THE ARCADE A HIGH CAMPUS SITE BUT LEVIN HUNDRED KIDS. AND THE MECHANICAL CAMPUS SITE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND AND WHAT THAT'S A COMMITMENT WE MADE. WE DON'T HAVE AN EXTRA SCIENCE TEACHER WE DON'T HAVE A THIS OR THAT BECAUSE WE MADE THAT COMMITMENT AND IN WILD YOU KNOW PEOPLE LOVE TO COME TO BE AND SAY WE'VE GOT EL CAP MONEY WE HAVE THIS MONEY. YES BUT YOU KNOW OUR STIRS CONTRIBUTIONS ARE GOING UP ONE AND A HALF PERCENT EVERY YEAR AND YOU KNOW EVERY TIME I TALK TO MY BUSINESS MANAGER I HAVE TO HUNGER AND SAKE. SEEMED IT'LL BE OKAY WILL WE WE WILL STAY IN THE BLACK SOMEHOW IN THE FUTURE IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW IS THE CATHOLIC AND IT'S AN ACTIVE. ACTIVE FAITH ARE ONLY MYSTERY BUT WE'LL WORK IT OUT I PROMISE YOU. NURSING IS IN SHORT SUPPLY WE HAVE MY DISTRICT HAS ONE SCHOOL NURSE. TO SITES SIX SEVEN MILES APART. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY THE MOST WELL STAFFED NURSING SYSTEM ERROR DISTRICT IN THE COUNTY OUR ELEMENTARY DISTRICT IS ELEVEN HUNDRED KIDS THREE SCHOOLS. A WEEKNURSES WHO GOES AND DOES REQUIRE TESTING ONE DAY ON ONE SCHOOL THEN THE NEXT THE NEXT. YOU KNOW THEN WHO IS THE WHO IS PROVIDING THE SERVICES. THE OFFICE LADIES AND SO THERE ARE CHALLENGES AND WE'RE NOT -- IN AND LAKE WILL BE GONE SPECIAL ED IN THE STATE AND 20% OF OUR KIDS ARE ON AYE EP'S NOW IN MY DISTRICT. THE VAST MAJORITY COME TO US ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM THERE MOSTLY IDENTIFIED BY FIFTH GRADE AND AS I LOOKED INTO IT AND WORKED IN THE SIX PEOPLE. A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE THOSE KIDS ARE GOING IN BECAUSE OF BEHAVIORAL ISSUES -- TALKED ABOUT WITH THE TEACHERS DO WITH THE TEACHERS WANT TO DO IT OUT OF SPRINT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN EUREKA. THREATEN FIFTY KIDS -- MY FRIEND WAS IN THERE DOING OBSERVATION RECENTLY IN THIS WONDERFUL FIRST GRADE TEACHER IS BUSY TEACHING A CLASS WITH THE LITTLE BOY WHO WOULD BE A TOP OF THE PYRAMID HERE KIND OF GET. LITERALLY SHE HAS BOTH ARMS AROUND AND SOME LITTLE GIRL NEXT TO THEIR IS TURNING THE BOOK SO THEY CAN READ ALOUD FOR THE CLASS BECAUSE IF SHE LET HIM GO. HE WAS GOING TO START DISRUPTING THE CLASS AND SHE GOT WHAT SHE WANTS AND THE OFFICE THEY'D BEEN TRADED MULTI TIER SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THIS IS A PPO SCHOOL THAT WITH HIGH FIDELITY. THIS CHILD NEEDS SOMETHING MORE AND YOU KNOW. IT'S NOT THAT BEING SAID SAW BAD NEWS WE ARE FORTUNATE WE HAVE REALLY OVER THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF OR SO. STARTED TO MODEL THIS INTERAGENCY COOPERATION THAT MS MILLER THAT WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT MICHAEL TALKED ABOUT IN THE LAST. PANEL THERE WHERE WE ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER THEIR CHALLENGES THOUGH -- MISTER -- MISBEHAVE. THERE'S A THERE'S A BACKRONYM THE USING ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM WE CALL THE STUDENT ASSISTANCE TEAM WHERE I'M FROM BUT IF. I'M IN THE STUDENT SYSTEMS TEAM OF MY DISTRICT AND SOMEBODY THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION TO TALK TO A STUDENT ABOUT THEM IN HIS. FOR BOB ARE MAKING IT HARDER FOR US TO SHARE INFORMATION TO HELP KIDS AND I KNOW YOU'RE THE ALL MIGHTY POWERFUL -- SIMPLY COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION STRUCTURE YOU CAN WAVE A MAGIC WAND SHELLACKING APPARENTLY -- TO OF TO BUT THAT THAT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN HOW CAN WE KNOW WHY CAN'T WE TALK TO BREAK DOWN SILOS IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT -- ARE COUNTY MIDDLE SERVICE TRIAGE GRANT WE WERE FORTUNATE WERE ONE OF FOR THE STATE TO GET IT FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS OVER -- FOR YEARS. THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT SUM OF MONEY WE'VE INTENTIONALLY. BROKEN IT UP ACROSS THE REGION'S BECAUSE WE'RE SO BALKANIZED SO MY REGION. THIRTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS TWELVE THIRTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICT SIX THOUSAND KIDS WITH FULL TIME CLINICIAN WE HAVE TO DISTRICT EMPLOYED. CASE CARRIERS OR SUPPORT PROVIDERS BUT THAT'S FOR SIX THOUSAND IN IF ONLY 1% OF THOSE KIDS ARE AT THAT HIGHEST HIGHEST LEVEL THAT SIXTY WELL ACCORDING I'M NOT A I'M A HISTORY TEACHER BY TRAINING BUT I'M TOLD THAT'S ALMOST TWICE REGULAR CASELOAD NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT. FROM WORK TO GREEN POINT IS AN HOUR AND FORTY ABOUT AN HOUR TWENTY MINUTE DRIVE SO WE DON'T WANT THESE PEOPLE SPENDING TIME IN CARS WE DO WANT THEM. AT THE AT THE SCHOOL AS FOR STARTING TO HAVE COMMON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN DECEMBER ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOLKS FROM COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH. CHILD WELFARE PROBATION SOME OF LOCAL TRIBES OTHERS CAME IN AND LEARNED ABOUT THE AYE YOU THE MAGIC OF THE IEP PROCESS AND HOW WE IDENTIFY KIDS STARTING FOR INSTANCE WITH A STUDENT STUDY TEAM WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THIS CHILD BEFORE WE GET THE MANY WHEN I EAT P. -- ON THE TWENTY SIXTH OF THIS MONTH YOU'RE ALL INVITED BUT UP ON THE TWENTY SIXTH OF THIS MONTH COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AND THOSE FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDING FOR THOSE OF US IN THE SCHOOLS. WHAT IT IS HOW IT WORKS WITH THEM SO THAT INSTEAD OF US JUST CALLING SWITCHBOARD AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO SAY WILL START TO MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS SO THERE IS A WAY? TO DO THIS -- CHAU JUST LIKE WE SAID YOU KNOW THE INFORMATION IS -- SHARING SOMETHING. IDEA OF TELL US LIKE HIGH TREE OR TELEHEALTH I THINK ONCE A KID GETS TO KNOW SOMEBODY. THERE IS A WAY TO DO THAT WHERE SOMEBODY CAN ACTUALLY REACHING OUT TO THESE FAR FLUNG SCHOOLS. MY GOOD FRIEND IS THE PRINCIPAL SUPERINTENDENT BUS DRIVER LEAD TEACHER OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR SIX KIDS -- SO EVEN IF THEY IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO QUALIFY EVEN IF THEY'RE ALL. LIKE YOU TO MEDI CAL TO SUPPORT A PROVIDER BUT THERE COULD VERY WELL BE ONE OR TWO KIDS THERE WHO MIGHT NEED HELP AND I WAS IN A MEETING WITH THE TWELVE SMALLEST DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT PRINCIPLES IN THE COUNTY THAT ANYBODY UNDER KIDS I ASKED HIM THIS QUESTION BECAUSE I KNEW. WAS COMING HERE'S A BE VERY CONSERVATIVE HOW MANY OF YOUR KIDS NEED AS AND I I'M NOT A CLINICIAN I DON'T NOTICES BUT PSYCHIATRIC LEVEL HELP AND I SAID SHOW ME SHOW FIGURES AS IT AND DON'T GO CRAZY DON'T TELL ME FOURTEEN FOR YOUR FORTY KIDS. TWENTY EIGHT FINGERS WENT UP -- MULTIPLE PEOPLE MIND YOU BUT BUT IT DOES FOR EIGHT HUNDRED KIDS IN IF YOU DO THE MATH THAT'S ABOUT THREE AND A HALF PERCENT. WHICH P. B. I. S. MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS IT'S SO WHENEVER GUARDS PLUS WE WERE NOT FAR ABOVE AVERAGE BUT HOW DO YOU SERVE TWENTY EIGHT KIDS IN. THIRTEEN DIFFERENT SCHOOL SITES OVER AN AREA THAT IS APPROACHING THE SIZE OF LA COUNTY IT IS A CHALLENGING SO WE NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE AND NUMBER. AND ALL THAT ALL STOP RIGHT THERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE DISTRICT DOES NOT JUST THE COMMENTS WERE I'M WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY MISTER BROWN -- JUST THE ENERGY WITH WHICH YOU APPROACH THIS AND AND THE THE ATTITUDE OF COURSE GOING TO FRONT FIGURE IT OUT -- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE -- OFTEN DON'T REALIZE IT IN A LOT OF RURAL COUNTIES WE HAVE A LOT MORE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHERE IS LOS ANGELES HAS ELLIE UST. HOW MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS TOTAL IN HUMBLE COUNTY? THIRTY TWO YEAH. AND WE HAVE ALMOST FORTY AND HOW AND CINEMA COUNTY AND AND AND AND YOU KNOW YOU HAD THE OTHER THREE COUNTIES I REPRESENT AND A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF THE LID. SO THE THE CHALLENGES IN RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THE GRANT WRITERS ALL THE TIME THEY'RE DOING A LOT OF THESE THINGS AND AND TRYING TO PULL ALWAYS RESOURCES TOGETHER IS REALLY DIFFICULT SO -- VERY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR EFFORTS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH ESPECIALLY FOR BEING HERE TODAY MY VOICE.

THEY'RE THE FOLKS WHO ARE SORT OF IN THE BACKGROUND AT SCHOOLS AND THEY CAN SERVE AS THE EYES AND EARS AND SO ONE OF THE POINTS THAT WE'D LIKE TO MAKE TODAY'S THAT WE IN GENERAL SHOULD BE. LEVERAGING IN USING OUR EXISTING RESOURCES BOTH ON CAMPUSES AS WELL AS IN -- IN TERMS OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WHEN WE'RE LOOKING TO DEVELOP THESE MODELS -- ARE CLASSIFIED WORKERS FOR EXAMPLES KNOW WHEN KIDS DON'T GET ENOUGH TO EAT THEY KNOW WHEN THEY'RE WEARING THE SAME CLOTHING DAY AFTER DAY AND THEY'RE THERE TO OBSERVE AND REALLY HELP SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE LIVES OF CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES -- WE AGREED THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF BRINGING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO CHILDREN ON CAMPUSES AND TO THEIR FAMILIES AND THIS MEANS BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL AS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES -- SCA USE INTERESTED IN A WRAPAROUND SERVICES APPROACH WHICH INTEGRATES AS WE HEARD TODAY FROM SEVERAL OF THE EXAMPLES -- SOCIAL SERVICES AS WELL AS SERVICES -- AND WE SUMMARIZE OKAY THANK YOU WE HAVE COMMENTS ON THE CARVE OUT QUESTION WHICH WAS RELEASED EARLIER IN THE FINANCING BUT OVERALL AS WE'RE DOING THIS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE HELD TO ITS MINIMUM QUALITY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON RAIN BE SEEN WITH THE NATIONAL UNION OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS TIMELY HEARING ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC -- YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THAT WHEN IT COMES A MENTAL HEALTH CALIFORNIA FACES A CRISIS AND BASED ON THE COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF OUR FOUR THOUSAND MEMBERS WHO WORK AS MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN THE STATE. WE COMPLETELY AGREE -- CALIFORNIA'S CONSISTENTLY SAY THAT THEIR COMMUNITY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS TO MEET THE LOCAL NEEDS -- IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY SUSPECTS THIS IN THE SYSTEM IN A WAY FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS -- WE MUST IN CANCER STATES PROVIDER NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS STRENGTHENED TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS AND TAKE MORE SUBSTANTIVE STEPS TO BETTER IMPLEMENT THE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT ACROSS THE BOARD. ONE EXAMPLE THE CHALLENGES WE FACE KAISER IS THE STATE'S LARGEST HMO WITH NINE MILLION ENROLLEES -- DO THE INADEQUACY OF ITS NETWORK OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROVIDERS MANY PATIENTS WAIT ONE TO TWO MONTHS FOR APPOINTMENTS INCLUDING THOSE WITH ACUTE CONDITIONS. THIS -- NOT ONLY VIOLATES PROFESSIONALLY RECOGNIZED STANDARDS BUT IT CAN ALSO SUBSTANTIALLY PROLONG A PATIENT'S RECOVERY TIMES. THERE'S YOUNG GIRL THAT THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ON THE HOUSE BY THE UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THIS HEARING IN YOUR LEADERSHIP. I ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS THAT I HEARD IN THE CONVERSATION TODAY WAS AROUND. COLLABORATION CONNECTIONS ACROSS SILOS IN BOLD SYSTEMS REFORM -- WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THESE COMPLEX DISCUSSIONS AND BELIEVE THE STATE HAS ACTUAL OPTIONS IN TWENTY NINETEEN INCLUDING A PROPOSAL TO RESTORE AND MODERNIZE. THE HEALTHY START INITIATIVE AT SIMPLY PUT THE HEALTHY START -- INITIATIVE WOULD ESTABLISH CROSS SERVICE COLLABORATIVE'S SUPPORTED BY ROBUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ACT AS A LOCAL FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES FACING OUR YOUTH AND FAMILIES TODAY -- AND I WILL BE SHARING. ALONG WITH -- THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND -- SOME MORE BACKGROUND MATERIALS TO YOUR STAFF. ON THIS PROPOSAL -- WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS AUTHORING A BILL SO THAT WILL BECOME BEFORE THIS -- THIS COMMITTEE -- AND JUST TO KIND OF KEEP IT SHORT A FRAMEWORK BOTH TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS THAT ARE FACING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES TODAY AROUND MENTAL HEALTH BUT ALSO AS THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM CHANGES FINANCING SYSTEMS CHANGE. OTHER NEEDS TO BE SUPPORT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO OPERATIONALIZE THOSE CHANGES AND WE BELIEVE HEALTHY START IS THE WAY FOR Và THANK YOU -- CHAMPS COUNTY MATILDA'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA AND I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM UNITED WAY'S TO CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THE HEALTHY START INITIATIVE AND WILL BE BRINGING INFORMATION ABOUT IT BUT I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IT'S A DATA DRIVEN PROGRAM THAT WE KNOW. WORKS DRUG USE WENT DOWN AND GRADUATION RATES WENT UP SO WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO TALKING TO YOU MORE ABOUT THAT. AND ALSO ONE OF THE REASONS WHY CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND HAS BEEN SO INTERESTED IN IT IS THAT IT'S AN INTEGRATED PROGRAM. AND IT WAS THE CULMINATION OF TWO YEARS OF RESEARCH LOOKING AT PROGRAMS THAT WORK FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND WE CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO TALK. ABOUT IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEMBERS LINDA TENER WHAT'S ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY DETECTION AND INTERVENTION AS A MEANS OF PREVENTING LASTING EFFECTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS SO AS FUNDS BECOME AVAILABLE OUT THERE PROP SIXTY FOUR CANNABIS REVENUES WE HOPE THOSE DOLLARS CAN BE DRAWN TO SUPPORT COST OF COST EFFECTIVE. IN EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS AT THE SCHOOL SITES -- SO THINGS LIKE A SPUR WHICH IS THE SCREENING AND BRIEF INTERVENTION AND REFERRAL TO TREATMENT PROGRAM -- WE THINK THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS REALLY INITIATE A DIALOGUE WITH STUDENTS AND REALLY GET TO THE HEART OF THEIR SUBSTANCE USE AND REALLY SCREEN FOR THOSE RISK FACTORS SO WE HOPE DOLLARS CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT. IN SCHOOL TREATMENT LIKE THAT -- AND HOPEFULLY CAN BECOME FULLY FUNDED IN IT'S LASTLY I'D BE REMISS IF WE DON'T DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEEDS OF OUR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT POPULATION I KNOW DIDN'T GET CHANCE -- TO DIVE INTO THAT TOO MUCH TODAY -- BUT WE HOPE MOVING FORWARD THIS BODY -- CAN LOOK AT FUNDING STREAMS TO TO SUPPORT THE SPECIFIC. THANK WITH POPULATION YOUR OF YOUR FIRST COMMENT ABOUT THE WHERE THE MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS GO. ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THE THEM. PROP SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS -- MISTER WOULD NIGHT WORKING ON SOMETHING. ALONG THOSE LINES TO MEASURE TO ENSURE THAT MONEY GOES. TO DIFFERENT PLACES NOT JUST ONE PLACE FANTASTIC THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THINKING. GOOD AFTERNOON DEEP INDIGNATION WITH THAT CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY -- ARE. CALIFORNIA GRAHAM POLICY CENTER -- I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANT CHALLENGES THAT CHILDREN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES FACE. THE CHRONIC STRESS AND TRAUMA THAT THEY DO RECEIVE BY SEEING A PARENT DEPORTED OR ARRESTED -- THESE TO THESE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES -- ADD UP AND RESULT IN SOME. REALLY BAD OUTCOMES WHEN IT COMES TO SCHOOL. IN A RECENT SURVEY THAT WE DID OF CALIFORNIA THE MAJORITY OF NOTED THAT THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN THEIR CHILD'S BEHAVIOR -- BUT THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING THE CARE THAT THEY NEED AND WE THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE INCREASED TRAINING TO DEAL WITH I YOU KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND CULTURE COMMUNITIES. ARE AND LANGUAGE ACCESS -- TO HELP STUDENTS IN SCHOOL SETTINGS ON WHERE THEY DO TRUST THE PROVIDERS -- WE ALSO THINK THAT IT'S REALLY CRITICAL AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CHILDREN DO HAVE MEDICAL COVERAGE EVEN IF THEY'RE UNDOCUMENTED. BUT IT IS REALLY CRITICAL TO EXTEND MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY TO UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS AS WELL BECAUSE WHEN THE PARENTS DR -- IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING HEALTHCARE ACCESS THANK YOU SO MUCH THEIR BEST ROBUST DISCUSSION. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CHRIS MILLER I'M A DOCTOR CAN AND EDUCATION AT THE RICHEST IMAGE CISCO REALLY SHOULD BE AT HOME WORKING ON MY DISSERTATION.

I AM ALSO SERVING ON THE HEALTH COLLABORATION COMMITTEE WHICH WILL FOCUS ON THE ROLLOUT OF THE HEALTH FRAMEWORK ONCE ADOPTED BY THE STATE BOARD OF ED IN MAY. INFORMED OF AFTERNOON THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS FOR THEIR INSIGHTS AND WISDOM. AS WE HEARD TODAY GOOD MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IS VERY IMPORTANT. NOW WHAT CAN THE COMMITTEE DUE TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH. WELLNESS LIKE TO PROPOSE THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER POSSIBLE LEGISLATION HEALTH AND SUICIDE PREVENTION INSTRUCTION IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS SENATE BILL THREE SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN SUGGESTS THAT THE I. Q. C. CONSIDER ADDING MENTAL HEALTH INSTRUCTION THE WHOLE FREE MARK. WELL THAT'S ALL IN GOOD THE FACT IS IN MANY SCHOOLS IN THE STATE THERE IS NO SUCH HEALTH CLASS. SO I AM WORKING WITH A FEW LEGISLATORS ON THE IDEA. LEGISLATION CAN BE MODELED ON WHAT WAS RECENTLY APPROVED IN THE STATES OF NEW YORK AND VIRGINIA IS THE LAST SIX MONTHS WHICH YOU HAVE -- IT CALIFORNIA'S ALWAYS BEEN THE FOREFRONT OF INNOVATIVE POLICIES IN LOSS IN OUR SCHOOLS WHAT BETTER WAY TO SUPPORT WAS REITERATED ABOUT THANK YOU FOR MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION AFTERNOON THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE DEARBORN REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NURSES I THINK ALL OF US AWARE THAT THE SCHOOL NURSES ON THE HEALTH PROFESSIONAL IN SCHOOL. AND THEY ARE THE DETECTIVE THAT VERY EARLY ON CAN ADD A DELTA PHI MANY OF THE CHILDREN THAT HAVE ISSUES AND SCHOOLS. THE SCHOOL NURSE OFFICE IS SEEN AS A SAFE HAVEN AND WE SPEND ABOUT 32% OF ALL TIME ADDRESSING SOME OF THE SCHOOL HEALTH ISSUES -- WE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A TEAM OR A SYSTEMS APPROACH. TO DEALING WITH ALL THESE ISSUES THE CHILDREN BRING TO SCHOOL BOTH PHYSICAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL AND TO THAT END. WE ARE SUPPORTING AND LIKELY TO BE INTRODUCING A BILL THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE OFFICE OF SCHOOL BASED HEALTH. WHICH WILL SET UP A COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.
