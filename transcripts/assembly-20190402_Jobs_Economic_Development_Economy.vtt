HONORABLE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER --

00:33:57.201 --> 00:33:59.203
ITS IT'S TRULY NEEDED --

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.505
COMMISSION.

00:34:00.571 --> 00:34:02.240

00:34:02.306 --> 00:34:04.142
THEY'RE GOING TO BE TAKING PLACE --

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:08.646
MY CONCERN IS IS IS AS FOLLOWS --

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:10.248
I TO SUPPORT THE EFFORT BUT THE

00:34:10.314 --> 00:34:12.417
CURRENTS OF THE COMMISSION AS IT

00:34:12.483 --> 00:34:14.652
IS RIGHT NOWIS GOING TO CAUSES

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:17.088
A LOT OF CHALLENGES SEE THAT.

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:19.123
ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE --

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.624
AEROSPACE AND AVIATION

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:20.858
INDUSTRIES HAVE VERY DIFFERENT

00:34:20.925 --> 00:34:22.360
NEEDS.

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:23.761
AND AS SUCH I WOULD ENCOURAGE

00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:25.263
HIM TO BE LOOKED AT SEPARATELY.

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:26.731
YOU HAVE A MANUFACTURING SECTOR

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:28.332
VERSUS A SERVICE ORIENTED

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:30.468
INDUSTRY THE AIRPORTS AND

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:31.002
WHATNOT.

00:34:31.068 --> 00:34:32.336
ARE TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT

00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:34.071
ANIMALS THE THE ONLY THING IN

00:34:34.138 --> 00:34:35.473
COMMON IS THAT THEY BOTH FLY

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.307
AIRCRAFT.

00:34:36.374 --> 00:34:37.942
AND SO I THINK REALLY THAT WE

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:39.877
NEED TO LOOK AT THE AT THE TWO

00:34:39.944 --> 00:34:41.012
INDUSTRIES VERY MUCH SEPARATELY.

00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:43.214
FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS -- THE

00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:44.782
FUNDING ALSO NEEDS TO BE

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:46.217
PROVIDED BY THE STATE IN THE

00:34:46.284 --> 00:34:47.985
SAME MANNER IT IS PROVIDED FOR

00:34:48.052 --> 00:34:49.420
IN THE INTEREST AIR SPACE

00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:50.521
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY HOWEVER

00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:52.356
AIRSPACE HAPPENS TO BE LARGER

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:53.624
THAN ENTERTAINMENT.

00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:55.193
AND AGRICULTURE INDUSTRIES

00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:57.128
COMBINED.

00:34:57.195 --> 00:34:57.728
BUT THAT SINK IN FOR JUST A

00:34:57.795 --> 00:34:58.463
SECOND.

00:34:58.529 --> 00:35:00.198
ENTERTAINMENT AGRICULTURE IS

00:35:00.264 --> 00:35:03.067
SMALLER THAN AEROSPACE INDUSTRY.

00:35:03.134 --> 00:35:05.570
AND WE HAVE A COMMISSION ON ON

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:07.238
ENTERTAINMENT BUT AS YET WE DO

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:08.806
NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO SUPPORT OUR

00:35:08.873 --> 00:35:11.409
AIRSPACE INDUSTRY.

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:12.944
THE LIKELIHOOD OF INDUSTRY

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.312
SUPPORTING THIS ARE FUNDING THIS

00:35:14.378 --> 00:35:17.014
IS VERY VERY SLIM.

00:35:17.081 --> 00:35:18.149
RUN THE RISK OF HAVING A PAY TO

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:19.951
PLAY SITUATION AND NO ONE WANTS

00:35:20.017 --> 00:35:22.854
TO BE A PART OF IF THE

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:02.393
THEY HAVE MANAGED COMPANIES WE

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.528

SEA LEVEL.

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:18.943
HERE IS TO JUST SAID THAT THE

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.711
COUPLE OF A OF ITEMS -- THEY ARE

00:36:20.778 --> 00:36:22.113
CITY STATE AND FEDERAL

00:36:22.179 --> 00:36:24.215
REGULATIONS WHICH DIFFER SO IT'S

00:36:24.282 --> 00:36:25.583
EASIER.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.285
CORD IMPORT CHEAPER TO PAY THE

00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:28.553
FINES AND TO TRY TO MEET THEM

00:36:28.619 --> 00:36:29.453

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.721
THIS IS ONE OF THE CIOS TELL ME.

00:36:30.788 --> 00:36:32.089
I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY SOMEBODY

00:36:32.156 --> 00:36:33.925

JUST PAY THE FINE.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.895
EPA'S FORCING COMPANIES TO MOVE

00:36:37.962 --> 00:36:40.264
OUT OF STATE WE NEED TO BE FIRM

00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:43.134
BUT BE PRAGMATIC ABOUT WILL BE

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.468
COULD BE FLEXIBLE Là.

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:46.437
I THINK THAT IS A SOMETHING THAT

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:48.039
WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT HI HOW

00:36:48.105 --> 00:36:50.308
CAN BE BE REASONABLE ABOUT SOME

00:36:50.374 --> 00:36:51.976
THE CHANGE OR BE IMPOSED ON

00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:53.010
INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO KEEP ON

00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:55.112
HERE WHILE STILL MAINTAINING IT

00:36:55.179 --> 00:36:56.914
COMING STATE.

00:36:56.981 --> 00:36:58.182
WORKMAN'S COMP IS INCREDIBLY

00:36:58.249 --> 00:36:59.850
HIGH INCOMES UP AS THE NUMBER

00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:01.385
ONE COMPLAINT FROM MANY FACTORS

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:03.321
THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT MUCH

00:37:03.387 --> 00:37:06.958
THE SAME AS OSHA. 8290% OF

00:37:07.024 --> 00:37:08.426
COMPANIES ARE SMALL AND THAT

00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:10.962
LESS THAN FIVE MILLION RANGE

00:37:11.028 --> 00:37:12.463
8290% OF ALL THESE COMPANIES.

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.532

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:15.733
EMPLOYEES OF COURSE.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.901
SO WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP

00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:18.169
THEM COMPETITIVE AND STAY IN

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:22.139
CALIFORNIA.

00:37:22.206 --> 00:37:24.275
WHAT WE MUCH CHANGE A REGULATORY

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:26.210

ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD AND IT IS

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:48.399
PARTLY BECAUSE OF AIR SPACE NOT

00:37:48.466 --> 00:37:49.433
IN SPITE OF IT.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.735

00:50:26.123 --> 00:50:27.324
THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY REASONS

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:29.860
JUST SAP WISH THE OFFICE A PLACE

ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT OF A PLACE

00:50:50.447 --> 00:50:52.048

DISADVANTAGE COMPARED WITH LARGE

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:51.654

NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WITH THE

01:10:48.611 --> 01:10:49.712
PROMISE THAT SHE WAS ON MOST OF

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:51.046
THEM RELATED TO THE FACT THAT

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:20.876
TEARS WERE RUNNING DOWN HER FACE

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:22.311
AND SHE JUST.

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:23.779
COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING

01:11:23.846 --> 01:11:25.347
LIKE A TWENTY FIVE CENT PLASTIC

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:27.616
ELECTRIC OUTLET COVER WAS GOING

01:11:27.683 --> 01:11:29.418
TO FORCE HER TO LAY OFF

01:11:29.485 --> 01:11:30.919
EMPLOYEES IN CLOSER BUSINESS.

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:31.954
SO THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:33.722
THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO TAKE

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:36.291
CARE OF I DON'T TO BE VERY CLEAR

01:11:36.358 --> 01:11:37.960
ABOUT SOMETHING NO ONE IS

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:39.228
TALKING ABOUT.

01:11:39.294 --> 01:11:41.697
ALLOWING SMALL BUSINESSES NOT TO

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:43.065
COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS THAT'S

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.233
CERTAINLY NOT THE ATTENTION

01:11:44.299 --> 01:11:46.502
INTENT HERE WE'RE TRYING.

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:47.870
TO A VERY NARROWLY CRAFTED

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:49.638
ABILITY TO GIVE DISCRETION TO

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:50.973
STATE AGENCIES WERE NOT FORCING

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.775
STATE AGENCIES NOT TO FIND

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:54.510
BUSINESSES -- WE'RE GIVING THEM

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:56.412
DISCRETION TO REDUCE THE FINES

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:58.013
OR ELIMINATE THE FINES IF THEY

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.715
FEEL THE CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANTED

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:00.749
AND WE'VE GIVEN THEM SOME

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:02.251
GUIDANCE ON WHEN THE

01:12:02.317 --> 01:12:03.519
CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT WARRANTED

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:04.620
FOR EXAMPLE A FIRST TIME

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:05.020
OFFENDER.

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:06.622
WHEN THE IT -- VIOLATION WAS

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:08.824
INADVERTENT WHEN THE VIOLATION

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:11.093
WAS RELATIVELY MINOR WHEN THE

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.294
BUSINESS COOPERATED WITH THE

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:14.029
INVESTIGATION AND WHEN THE

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:15.330
VIOLATION WAS CORRECTED.

01:12:15.397 --> 01:12:16.665
AND THOSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:17.800
IN WHICH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:19.435
DOING THIS IN A TO BE CLEAR

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:20.636
THESE AGENCIES.

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:21.837
ARE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:23.806
ALREADY WANT TO REDUCE THE FINES

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.808
NOTE NO STATE AGENCY WANTS TO

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:27.476
LEVY A FINE ON A BUSINESS THAT'S

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:28.110
SO ONEROUS.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:29.378
THAT THAT BUSINESSES IS FORCED

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:31.013
TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS BUT RIGHT

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.481
NOW WITH HANDCUFF THEM BECAUSE

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:34.583
STATE LAW -- IS VERY STRICT ON

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:35.584
WHAT THE FINES AND PENALTIES

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:36.852
HAVE TO BE AND SO THEY HAVE NO

01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:37.953
DISCRETION RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.321
GIVING THEM THAT DISCRETION WITH

01:12:39.388 --> 01:12:40.656
A. B..

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:41.323
FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE SO WITHOUT BE

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:44.259
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:45.427
THAT THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE.

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:46.195
ARE THERE ARE ANY WITNESSES IN

01:12:46.261 --> 01:12:48.330
SUPPORT.

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:50.099
SEEN UNDER THERE WEREN'T ANY

01:12:50.165 --> 01:12:53.435
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:54.870
MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MAP BROUGHT

01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:56.205
FOR THE TEAMSTERS -- WE ACTUALLY

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:57.973
DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION AND

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.241
I I THINK WE JUST HAVE SOME

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:01.143
CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:03.245
THIS SORT OF UNDERLYING TENSION

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:04.613
THIS CREATES WHERE YOU HAVE

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.948
STATE REGULATORS WHO WERE.

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:07.416
TRYING TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:09.384
MAYBE -- SMALL BUSINESSES THAT

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:11.053
ARE ARE TRYING TO COMPLY BUT WE

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.923
DON'T KIND IT WANT TO CREATE A A

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.959
A WAY OUT FOR THEM -- YOU KNOW

01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:18.827
IF IF THEY'RE JUST BEING

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:22.431
NEGLIGENT THANK YOU.

01:13:22.498 --> 01:13:23.398
VENTURE MEMBERS MIKE WE OWE THE

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:24.800
CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION --

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:26.068
WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE AN OPPOSE

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:27.870
POSITION APOLOGIZED WERE GETTING

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:29.438
EARLIER IN THE COMMITTEE LATE --

01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:30.472
BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:32.341
WOULD CREATE.

01:13:32.407 --> 01:13:34.009
A WAY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.077
EVADE.

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:37.246
PENALTIES -- FOR WORKER HEALTH

01:13:37.312 --> 01:13:38.180
SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.414
PROTECTIONS I'M AND WE ALSO

01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:40.716
BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS OVERLY

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:41.950
BROAD ARRAY IS SMALL BUSINESSES

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:44.520
COMPRISE OF 90% OF ALL BUSINESS

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:45.521
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:47.322
MAKE UP -- THE EMPLOYEE ABOUT

01:13:47.389 --> 01:13:48.457
HALF OUR PRIVATE SECTOR WORK

01:13:48.524 --> 01:13:50.125
FORCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BILL

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:51.193
THAT WOULD LIMIT LIABILITY ON

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.828
THOSE EMPLOYERS THAT WILL HAVE A

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:55.097
MASSIVE IMPACT ON THE NUMBER OF

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:56.431
EMPLOYEES IN NUMBER OF

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:57.633
BUSINESSES AND THE STATE.

01:13:57.699 --> 01:13:59.802
AND IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:00.769
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:02.104
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY IS MADE UP

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.539
OF SMALL BUSINESSES RIGHT WE'RE

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:04.907
TALKING ABOUT INDUSTRIES LIKE

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:06.341
CONSTRUCTION JANITORIAL.

01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:08.277
AGRICULTURAL -- MOST OF THESE

01:14:08.343 --> 01:14:09.011
ARE COMPRISED OF SMALL

01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:10.813
BUSINESSES THAT THEY ALSO HAVE

01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:12.114
SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:14.149
WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:16.251
ENVIRONMENTAL VIOLATIONS --

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:17.586
ENDED ANOTHER THING WORTH NOTING

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:19.087
IS THAT OUR STATE AGENCIES ARE

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:20.689
STRETCHED THIN -- THAT LABOR

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:22.124
AGENCY DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:14:22.191 --> 01:14:24.026
RESOURCES TODAY ENOUGH STAFF TO

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:25.561
DO THE TO TO COVER ALL THESE

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:27.496
BUSINESSES ENVIRONMENTAL

01:14:27.563 --> 01:14:28.564
AGENCIES ARE ALSO STRETCHED TO

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:31.166
THE LIMIT -- EIGHT CAL CAL OSHA

01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:32.868
IN -- TWENTY FIFTEEN HAD IT WITH

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:34.303
CITED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:36.738
FOR NOT HAVING ENOUGH STAFF TO

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.674
DEAL WITH WORKER TO WORKER

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:39.675
COMPLAINTS UNTIMELY WAY.

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:42.277
SO -- IT HAVING CLEAR VIOLATIONS

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:43.579
HAVING CLEAR PENALTIES FOR

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:45.314
VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS IS A

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.748
WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT --

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:48.283
WORKERS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:50.419
PUBLIC ARE SAFE AND IT CREATING

01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:52.654
THE SORT OF LOOPHOLE OR A WAY

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:54.857
FOR STATE AGENCIES TO GET OUT OF

01:14:54.923 --> 01:14:56.592
COMPLYING WITH THE FLU --

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.293
VIOLATIONS THEY'VE SUFFERED IS A

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.229
BAD THING -- AND IT'S ALSO WORTH

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:02.097
NOTING AGAIN THAT IT WASN'T THAT

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:06.001
LONG AGO THAT WE HAD A A

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:07.269
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR WHO I WAS

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:07.769
STATEMENT MAYBE DIDN'T

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:10.105
NECESSARILY CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:11.673
WORKER SAFETY ARE UNDERFUNDED

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.308
UNDERSTAFFED -- ENVIRONMENTAL

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:15.377
AGENCIES AND LABOR AGENCIES SO

01:15:15.444 --> 01:15:17.479
THE BROAD IMPACT THIS BILL COULD

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:19.114
POTENTIALLY ALLOW THESE AGENCIES

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:27.823
TO REDUCE WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:30.125
PENALTIES FOR WORKER SAFETY FOR

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:31.159
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IS MADE

01:15:31.226 --> 01:15:32.227
EVEN DOWN TO ZERO HE KNOWS.

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:32.895
BUT WE CAN'T JUST LOOK UNDER THE

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:33.528
LANDS OF THE IMPACT OF IT RIGHT

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:34.196
NOW WITH THE SORT OF PROGRESSIVE

01:15:34.263 --> 01:15:34.763
LEGISLATURE AND THE CURRENT

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:35.364
GOVERNOR WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:36.698
THE FUTURE AND SEE HOW CAN THIS

01:15:36.765 --> 01:15:37.532
BILL BE USED AND WE'VE WE'VE.

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:38.767
WE FEEL THAT THERE COULD BE SOME

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:39.601
SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACTS FOR

01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:41.436
WORKERS IN OUR COMMUNITY SO FOR

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:42.004
THOSE REASONS WERE STRONGLY

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:44.539
OPPOSED.

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:45.641
WAIT ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:46.441
LIKE TO SPEAK PLEASE THANK YOU

01:15:46.508 --> 01:15:47.943
MADAM CHAIR.

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:48.577
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE I

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:49.678
WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:50.946
RESPOND.

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:52.748
TO THE GENTLEMAN'S -- ARGUMENT

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:55.317
THERE AS I UNDERSTOOD IT HE'S SO

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.386
MAKING. TWO MAIN POINTS ONE IS

01:15:57.452 --> 01:15:59.288
THAT -- SOMEHOW YOUR BILL WILL

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:01.423
ALLOW SMALL BUSINESSES AS THE

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:04.359
FINE -- TO ESCAPE LIABILITY AS

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:06.261
OPPOSED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:09.097
WITH LAW AND REGULATION -- AND

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:10.499
HIS AND OTHER POINT IS THAT.

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:11.900
IN SO DOING I THINK THAT WILL

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:13.535
UNDERMINE WORKER PROTECTIONS

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:14.503
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS AND

01:16:14.569 --> 01:16:16.538
SUCH OVER THE LONG RUN I WAS

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:18.874
JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD --

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:19.875
RESPOND TO THOSE TWO POINTS SURE

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:23.312
WELL OUR I AM CERTAINLY VERY

01:16:23.378 --> 01:16:24.546
COGNIZANT THAT. ONE OF THE

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:25.847
REASONS STATE REGULATION EXIST

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:27.816
IS TO ENSURE WORKER SAFETY AND

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:30.752
CONSUMER SAFETY SO WE WERE NOT

01:16:30.819 --> 01:16:32.354
TRYING TO JEOPARDIZE THOSE.

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:34.122
AT ALL AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE SO

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:36.124
NARROWLY CRAFTED THE

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:38.026
CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:39.828
BUSINESS COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:41.496
RELIEF UNDER THIS IT HAS TO BE.

01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:44.132
A A FIRST TIME OFFENSE.

01:16:44.199 --> 01:16:46.001
IT HAS TO BE A MINOR VIOLATION

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:47.202
WHICH MEANS THAT SOMETHING THAT

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.236
MAJOR WITH THAT AFFECTED WORKER

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:49.638
SAFETY I DON'T DO NOT THINK

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:51.039
WOULD BE COVERED UNDER THIS.

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:53.608
THE BUSINESS HAS TO COOPERATE

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:54.643
WITH THE INVESTIGATION WHICH

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:56.878
MEANS IF THEY'RE TRYING -- TO TO

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:58.113
OBSCURE THE FACT THAT THE

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:58.947
VIOLATION EXISTED THEY DON'T

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:00.849
QUALIFY AND THE VIOLATION MUST

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:02.617
HAVE BEEN CORRECTED WHICH MEANS

01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:03.819
THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN

01:17:03.885 --> 01:17:05.354
IN THE FUTURE SO I THINK UNDER

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:06.788
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT'S REALLY

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:07.923
HARD TO ARGUE.

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:09.624
THAT A SMALL BUSINESS SHOULD BE

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:10.592
FINED.

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:12.160
POTENTIALLY A LARGE AMOUNT OF

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:13.161
MONEY AND AND AND TO BE CLEAR

01:17:13.228 --> 01:17:14.529
THIS THIS.

01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:15.864
BILL WOULD NOT.

01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:17.666
REQUIRE STATE AGENCIES TO

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:19.935
ELIMINATE THE FINE IF THE

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:21.069
BUSINESS COULD PAY THE FINE THEN%

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:22.504
THE FULL AMOUNT OF FINE COULD

01:17:22.571 --> 01:17:24.272
STILL BE ASSESSED IF -- THE

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:25.374
STATE AGENCY DETERMINES THAT

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.342
PERHAPS A 50% REDUCTION IN THE

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:28.443
FINE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE UNDER

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:30.078
THE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WOULD

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:32.014
BARELY BE EMPOWERED TO DO THAT.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.382
AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS.

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:36.218
THE ASSERTION THAT THIS WOULD

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:37.886
ALLOW THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY TO

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:39.921
THRIVE MORE BECAUSE I THINK THE

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:41.256
OPPOSITE IS VERY WE CLEARLY TRUE.

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:43.125
THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE IN THE

01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:44.893
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY -- I

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:46.328
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH MY

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:47.829
COLLEAGUES IN LABOR FEDERATION

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:49.197
THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:50.966
OF WORKER SAFETY VIOLATIONS BUT

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:51.767
IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:52.701
UNDERGROUND THAT THOSE

01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:54.302
VIOLATIONS ARE NOT CAUGHT THERE

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:55.704
NOT BEING FIND RIGHT NOW SO.

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:57.205
I DON'T SEE HOW THIS BILL COULD

01:17:57.272 --> 01:17:58.907
POSSIBLY BE CONSTRUED -- TO

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:00.675
EXPAND THEIR RANKS IN FACT I

01:18:00.742 --> 01:18:01.410
THINK IT WOULD REDUCE THEIR

01:18:01.476 --> 01:18:02.644
RANKS BY HOPEFULLY BRING SOME OF

01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:03.812

01:18:03.879 --> 01:18:07.182
