KINDERGARTEN ENDS THE CAN GARDEN

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:30.650
FACILITY GRANTS.

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:31.918
AS BACKGROUND IN KINDERGARTEN

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.486
THE STATE REQUIRES DISTRICTS

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:35.221
OFFER KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS BUT

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.290
LEAVES IT TO DISTRICTS TO

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:37.891
DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF THESE

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:38.157
PROGRAMS.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:40.593
PARTY PROGRAMS OPERATE BETWEEN

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.828
THREE TO FOUR HOURS WHEREAS FULL

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:44.397
DAY PROGRAMS OPERATE MORE THAN

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:45.098
FOUR HOURS.

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:46.666
I'M AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:47.500
MENTIONED LAST YEAR THE

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.502
LEGISLATURE PROVIDED ONE HUNDRED

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.371
MILLION IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:52.672
TO CREATE KINDERGARTEN FACILITY

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.706
GRANTS.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:54.641
THESE GRANTS WERE PRIMARILY

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.509
INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE MORE FULL

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:57.143
DAY KINDERGARTEN THROUGHOUT THE

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.213
STATE BY COVERING FACILITY COSTS

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.248
ASSOCIATED WITH.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.416
DEEP KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS TO

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.751
FULL DAY PROGRAMS FOR INSTANCE A

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.119
DISTRICT ME RUN A MORNING

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:08.421
SESSION AND AN AFTERNOON SESSION

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:09.989
AND ONE CHAIR CLASSROOM.

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:11.257
BUT ONCE THAT WAS PART DAY

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:12.559
PROGRAMS ARE CONVERTED TO TWO

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.794
FULL DAY CLASSROOMS -- FULL DAY

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.262
PROGRAMS EACH PROGRAM WOULD

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.864
REQUIRE SEPARATE CLASSROOM IN

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:19.532
THESE GRANTS WOULD HELP COVER

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.935
SOME OF THOSE AS THOUGH IT

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:22.468
SUCCEEDED FACILITY COSTS.

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:23.670
IN THE FIRST APPLICATION AROUND

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:25.204
WHICH CONCLUDED JANUARY OF THIS

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.173
YEAR A TOTAL OF SEVENTY

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.641
DISTRICTS OMITTED TWO HUNDRED

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:31.578
AND SIXTY TWO PROJECTS

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:32.679
REQUESTING.

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:33.746
THE TWO MILLION AND FINDING THIS

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:36.549
EXCEEDS THE TOTAL ONE HUNDRED

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:37.884
MILLION PROVIDED FOR THE PROGRAM.

00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.719
A SECOND APPLICATION AROUND WILL

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.654
OCCUR NEXT MONTH IN MAY TO

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.156
ALLOCATE THE REMAINING FUNDING.

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:45.258
WILL SKIP PAGE TWO BECAUSE THAT

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:46.092
JUST COVERS THE GOVERNOR'S

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.027
PROPOSAL WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:50.697
FINANCE ALREADY COVERED.

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:51.798
I'M MOVING ON TO PAGE THREE AND

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:53.666
OUR ASSESSMENTS WE OUTLINED

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.368
THREE MAIN CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:56.769
AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.271
FIRST WE ARE CONCERNS THAT THE

00:03:58.338 --> 00:04:00.173
ADDITIONAL GRANTS ARE NOT LIKELY

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.774
TO ACHIEVE THE SEATS GOAL OF

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:03.109
HAVING MORE FULL DAY

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:04.844
KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:05.945
AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE FIGURE ON

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:07.880
PAGE THREE WE ANALYZE THE

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.616
INITIAL ROUND OF APPLICANTS AND

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:12.552
FOUND THAT 76% OF THE SEVENTY

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.220
APPLICANTS ALREADY RUN FULL DAY

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.355
PROGRAMS.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.656
THESE ARE DISTRICTS APPLYING TO

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.224
LARGELY REPLACE EXISTING FULL

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:19.926
DAY KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS THAT

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:21.561
DO NOT MEET CITY REGULATIONS.

00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:23.029
AND THIS WAS A SECONDARY PURPOSE

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.197
FOR THE GRANTS.

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:25.765
THE LEGISLATURE WORD EXPAND THE

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.834
PROGRAM AS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.102
WE THINK A SIMILARLY HIGH

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:30.036
SHERIFF GRANTS WOULD GO TO

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.738
DISTRICTS ALREADY RUNNING FULL

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.006
DAY PROGRAMS.

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:34.540
SECOND WE FOUND THAT DISTRICTS

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.242
ME OPERATE PARTY PART PROGRAMS

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:37.644
FOR REASONS BEYOND FACILITY

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.545
CONSTRAINTS FOR EXAMPLE SOME

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:40.613
DISTRICTS TOLD US THAT THEIR

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.115
PARENTS PREFERRED THEIR CHILDREN

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.783
ATTEND A PARTY PROGRAM.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.685
ARE THESE PARENTS THINK THAT

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.053
FIVE YEAR OLDS ARE NOT ARE NOT

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.055
SEE READY FOR A LONGER DAY OF

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.590
INSTRUCTION.

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:51.724
OTHER DISTRICTS INDICATED THAT

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.026
THEIR TEACHERS PREFER PART DAY

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:55.161
PROGRAMS BECAUSE THE LEAD CLASS

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:56.629
FOR A FEW HOURS AND THEN PROVIDE.

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:58.665
AND ASSISTANCE FOR ANOTHER

00:04:58.731 --> 00:04:59.465
TEACHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.601
DAY DISTRICTS MAY ALSO USE THESE

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:03.369
KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS TO PROVIDE

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:05.004
OTHER INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:06.706
I'M SUCH AS INTENSIVE READING

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:08.775
INTERVENTION OR TEACHING MATH OR

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:10.443
SCIENCE TO OLDER CHILDREN -- IN

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.544
AFTER HIM.

00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:13.112
GIVEN THESE ISSUES WE THINK SOME

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:14.981
PORTION OF DISTRICTS RUNNING

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:17.316
PARTY PROGRAMS MAY SIMPLY NOT BE

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:18.518
INTERESTED IN THESE GRANTS.

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.486
THIRD MOST DISTRICTS INTERESTED

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:22.055
IN OPERATING FULL THE PROGRAMS

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.823
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COVER THEIR

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.391
FACILITY COSTS WITH EXISTING

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.859
SOURCES OF STATE AND LOCAL

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:27.894
FINDING.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.462
OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS THE

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.397
SHARE OF STUDENTS ENROLLED IN

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:34.567
FULLY PROGRAMS GREW FROM 43%

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:35.535
270%.

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.236
A DISTRICT INTERESTED IN RUNNING

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:38.438
FULL DAY PROGRAMS MAY BE

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:39.706
ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING THROUGH THE

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:42.041
EXISTING SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:43.443
WHICH IS THE STATE WATER LONGER

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.645
STANDING PROGRAM THAT HELPS FUND

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:47.346
SCHOOL FACILITIES FOR ALL GRADES.

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:52.351
OR DISTRICTS MAY RELY ON LOCAL

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:55.154
FIND FOR AYE DRESSING THESE

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:56.322
FACILITY CONSTRAINTS.

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.691
MOVING ON TO THE LAST PAGE. FOR

00:05:58.758 --> 00:05:59.158
THESE REASONS WE ARE

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:00.393
RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.627
REFRAIN FROM EXPANDING THE

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:04.097
PROGRAM AT THIS TIME WE DO OFFER

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:05.565
TO MORE TARGETED OPTION SHOULD

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:06.766
THE LEGISLATURE REMAIN

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.534
INTERESTED IN PROMOTING FULL DAY

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:09.769
KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS.

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:11.170
FIRST THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:12.638
REVISIT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:15.374
NEXT YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:15.942
TWENTY ONE AFTER KNOWS MORE

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:17.076
ABOUT THE DEMAND AFTER THE

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:18.411
INITIAL ONE HUNDRED MILLION IS

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:19.245
AWARDED.

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.913
IF THE LEGISLATURE DESIRES TO

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.815
PROVIDE MORE FACILITY GRANTS

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.317
BASED ON ANY REMAINING FUNDING

00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:25.551
WE RECOMMEND IT FOCUS THE

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:26.886
PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY ON

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:28.488
DISTRICTS RUNNING PART DAY

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:29.756
PROGRAM DUE TO FACILITY

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:30.923
CONSTRAINTS.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.692
SECONDLY THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:33.760
CONSIDER CREATING AN EVEN

COMMUNITIES ON THE REMAINING.

00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:46.632
PART DAY PROGRAMS ARE IN UPPER

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:48.167
MIDDLE CLASS AND AFFLUENT.

00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:51.237
COMMUNITIES -- AS THE OFFICE

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:52.705
PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION JUST

00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:54.206
INDICATE IT'S THE TARGETING

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:55.774
LANGUAGES WORKING. TO SOME

00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:57.943
EXTENT IN TERMS OF FOCUSING NEW

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.578
DOLLARS ON FOR COMMUNITIES.

00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:00.946
ALTHOUGH THE BULK OF THOSE

00:13:01.013 --> 00:13:02.548
COMMUNITIES ALREADY OFFER FULL

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:02.715
DAY.

00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:03.949
K..

00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:06.152
I'M WHEN WE LOOK AT TKD IS

00:13:06.218 --> 00:13:08.320
HEADED IS ESSENTIALLY IDENTICAL

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:10.289
THAT IS WE SEE UPWARD GROWTH --

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:13.959
OVERALL IN FULL TKA -- ACCEPTED

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:15.694
THEM ONE THIRD OF ELEMENTARY'S

00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:16.162
IN THE STATE'S POOREST

00:13:16.228 --> 00:13:18.063
COMMUNITIES -- DO NOT OFFER T.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.432
K. THAT IS WE HAVE A REMAINING

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:21.033
ONE THIRD.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.269
A LITTLE OVER 33% OF ELEMENTARY

00:13:23.335 --> 00:13:24.537
IS THAT STILL.

00:13:24.603 --> 00:13:26.071
DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OR

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.940
WHERE WITH ALL TO OFFER FULL DAY

00:13:28.007 --> 00:13:30.342
TKA -- BUT WE HAVE MUCH MORE

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:32.545
ROOM TO GROW OUT TKA FOR FOUR

00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:34.346
YEAR OLDS AND WE DO. TO GROW OUT

00:13:34.413 --> 00:13:36.782
FULL DAY FOR FIVE YEAR OLDS AND

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:37.483
AGAIN.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.185
WE KNOW THAT A ONLY ABOUT HALF

00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:41.320
OF ALL THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:42.855
CAN FIND ANY SORT OF PRE K..

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:45.191
PROGRAMS SO I THINK IT'S BACK TO

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:46.625
THIS ISSUE OF RELATIVE NEED.

00:13:46.692 --> 00:13:48.928
AND RELATIVE UNMET NEEDS.

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:49.795
SO THERE'S A COUPLE TAKE AWAYS

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:51.897
HERE ONE IS ADDITIONAL

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:53.399
INCENTIVES TO EXPAND FULL DAY K..

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:54.633
WOULD MOST LIKELY BENEFIT

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.835
FAMILIES AND BETTER OFF PARTS OF

00:13:56.902 --> 00:13:58.370
THE STATE OR IN AREAS OF THE

00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:00.573
STATE THAT ALREADY OFFER FULL

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:02.274
DAY K. AS YOU JUST HEARD -- NEW

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:04.076
FUNNY COULD FINANCE RENOVATION

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:05.444
OF ALL CLASSROOMS.

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:07.279
IN DISTRICTS ALREADY RUNNING

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:08.881
FULL DAY K. THAT IS WE HAVE WE

00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:10.249
DO HAVE OBVIOUSLY BIG NEED IN

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:11.817
CENTRAL VALLEY.

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:13.185
INLAND EMPIRE PART DATE WERE

00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:14.853
FACILITIES ARE OLD.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.588
AND WE NEED TO RENOVATE THOSE

00:14:15.654 --> 00:14:17.790
FACILITIES SO NEW FUNDING COULD

00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:19.458
HELP IN THAT WAY BUT THAT

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:21.660
DOESN'T HELP US EXPAND -- FULL

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:23.929
DAY K. IT JUST ALLOWS EXISTING

00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:28.601
DISTRICTS WITH FULL DAY QUE. TO

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:29.935
IMPROVE THEIR FACILITIES.

00:14:30.002 --> 00:14:30.536
AND SECONDLY THERE'S MUCH MORE

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:31.537
ROOM TO GROW TKA FOR FOUR YEAR

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:32.605
OLDS AND TO GROW FULL DAY K. FOR

00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:33.572
FIVE YEAR OLDS.

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:34.873
AND I JUST CLOSE WITH THE THIRD

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.175
POINT WHICH IS OTHER RESEARCHERS

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:37.543
OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.811
HAVE.

00:14:38.877 --> 00:14:40.112
PRETTY MUCH DETERMINE THE FULL

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:41.847
DAY K. DOES RAISE KIDS EARLY

00:14:41.914 --> 00:14:43.515
COGNITIVE GROWTH IN EARLY

00:14:43.582 --> 00:14:45.551
LITERACY SKILLS WILL THEY QUE IS

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:46.619
EFFECTIVE.

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:48.320
BUT THERE'S A BIG PROVISO HERE

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:50.155
WHICH IS THAT THOSE EFFECTS ON

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:51.457
KIDS ARE MUCH STRONGER. FOR

00:14:51.523 --> 00:14:52.958
YOUNGSTERS FROM DISADVANTAGED

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:55.261
BACKGROUNDS AS OPPOSED TO UPPER

00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:57.229
MIDDLE CLASS.

00:14:57.296 --> 00:14:58.330
GRAMS.

00:14:58.397 --> 00:14:59.265
SO HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:00.733
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WHAT

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:03.769
DOCTOR WHAT WITH RESPECT TO WELL.

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.471
I GUESS LET ME AS THIS WHAT

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:07.039
WOULD BE YOUR SUGGESTION.

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:08.407
OR OF WHAT WOULD BE YOUR

00:15:08.474 --> 00:15:11.877
SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF TRYING.

00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:13.946
TO EXPAND FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN

00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:15.347
TO THOSE REGIONS IN THOSE

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:17.483
COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T CURRENTLY

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:20.519
OFFER IT TO THE PLEDGE ANALYSTS

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.354
TO SUGGESTED.

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:25.958
AB SUGGESTING THE THE RATES THE

00:15:26.025 --> 00:15:28.427
REIMBURSEMENT RATES IN THE US --

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:30.129
BETWEEN PART DAY IN FULL DAY.

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:32.097
AS ONE ALTERNATIVE YEAH I THINK

00:15:32.164 --> 00:15:35.434
THAT HAS MERIT SENATOR -- NOW AS

00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:38.103
YOU KNOW -- DISTRICTS GET THE

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.838
SAME REIMBURSEMENT SO TO SPEAK

00:15:39.905 --> 00:15:40.739
WHETHER THEY HAVE PARKED THEIR

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:42.541
FULL DAY AND IN SOME DISTRICTS

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:43.842
TEACHERS ARE OPTING TO STAY WITH

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:45.277
PART DAY BECAUSE AND THERE'S NO

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:46.512
FINANCIAL PENALTY SO I THINK

00:15:46.578 --> 00:15:48.847
DIFFERENTIAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:50.816
RADIATE RATES -- FOR FULL DAY

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:54.720
PROGRAMS IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA --

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:56.155
IF THERE'S A WAY TO TIGHTEN THE

00:15:56.221 --> 00:15:58.090
BUDGET CONTROL LANGUAGE. TO

00:15:58.157 --> 00:16:00.225
BETTER ENSURE THAT THE MONEY'S

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:01.660
MOVING TO THOSE DISTRICTS THAT

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:02.861
DON'T OFFER FULL THE

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:04.763
DISADVANTAGED DISTRICTS THAT

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.532
DON'T OFFER FULL DAY AT THE

00:16:06.598 --> 00:16:08.634
CONTROL LANGUAGE MIGHT HELP.

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:09.268
THE OTHER IDEA THAT I KNOW IT'S

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:10.536
BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN THE

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:12.271
ASSEMBLY SIDE IS TO TRY.

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:14.106
TO TARGET THIS MONEY ON TKA

00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:17.409
WITHIN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:17.876
WHICH WOULD GO TOWARDS

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:19.311
INCREASING.

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:19.912
ENROLLMENT RATES FOR FOUR YEAR

00:16:19.978 --> 00:16:20.913
OLDS.

00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:22.781
WHICH WE NOR MUCH LOWER THAN

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:24.550
CURRENT SERVICES FOR FIVE ROOMS

00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:26.352
SO SORT OF DIVERT THE PROPOSED

00:16:26.418 --> 00:16:27.853
FUNDING AWAY FROM.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.188
THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM FULL

00:16:29.254 --> 00:16:31.056
DAY KINDERGARTEN TO THE T. CASE --

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:32.658
YEAH IT WOULD STILL PARTIALLY

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:33.392
ACCOMPLISHED THE GOVERNOR'S

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:34.793
OBJECTIVE OF OF EATING

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.595
KINDERGARTEN BUT IT WOULD RAISE

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:40.232
SERVICES AND AND ACCESS FOR FOUR

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:42.267
YEAR OLDS AS OPPOSED.

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:43.669
TO FIVE FINANCE WHAT'S YOUR VIEW

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:45.771
ON THE LA -- HAD SOME

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:47.840
SUGGESTIONS SOME ALTERNATIVES

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:51.677
AND IN TERMS OF SUGGESTING A

00:16:51.744 --> 00:16:53.912
MOVE AWAY FROM PART TIME AND

00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:55.414
TOWARD FULL TIME FULL DAY

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:58.851
KINDERGARTEN.

00:16:58.917 --> 00:17:00.319
YEAH I MEAN WE AT THIS POINT WE

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:02.321
KNOW WE STILL NEED TO SUPPORT

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:03.422
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS AS AS A

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:04.890
SUBMITTED BUT WE DEFINITELY HAVE

00:17:04.957 --> 00:17:06.291
ARE TAKING THOSE -- THAT

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:07.326
FEEDBACK ELLIE -- PROVIDED AND

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:08.694
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS BROUGHT INTO

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:10.596
CONSIDERATION AS WE DEVELOP A

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:14.299
REVISION -- THERE INTO THE IDEAS

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:15.834
OR THOUGHTS IN IN THOSE.

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:17.536
IN THOSE REPORTS HAVE MERIT BUT

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:19.405
WE NEED TO DO AN ANALYSIS AND

00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:21.006
YOU KNOW TAKE THAT TAKE THAT

00:17:21.073 --> 00:17:22.708
TAKE THEM INTO CONSIDERATION

00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:25.177
WITH ALL OTHER FACTORS A ME TO

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:27.246
PUT YOU ON THE SPOT.

00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:31.683
I DO APPRECIATE YOUR POSITION.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.087
SIR LIVE ANY QUESTIONS YES.

00:17:35.154 --> 00:17:35.654
SO.

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.589
BECAUSE SHE QUE HAS NO -- JEWEL

00:17:37.656 --> 00:17:39.358
BILL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS --

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:40.959
LOW INCOME KIDS ARE NOT

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:43.028
PRIORITIZE SAT CORRECT.

00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:43.729
SO THAT IN THAT THERE ARE IN

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:44.530
THERE WOULD BE NO REQUIREMENT

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:45.898
THAT THIS WAS DONE AT THAT AT

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:47.132
TITLE ONE SCHOOLS WHICH ARE

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:48.500
POOREST SCHOOLS.

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:49.735
SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS WOULD

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:51.637
THAT BE THE BEST EXPENDITURE OF

00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:54.339
OUR MONEY EXPANDING THE T. K.

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:57.075
PROGRAM.

00:17:57.142 --> 00:17:59.645
I AM I GUESS MY MY CONCERN IS IS

00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:01.146
WE WOULD ONLY BE BUT WE ONLY BE

00:18:01.213 --> 00:18:02.581
HELPING.

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:03.882
KIDS THAT COME FROM FAMILIES

00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:06.685
WHERE THEY DON'T NEED THE HELP.

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:08.654
WELL IF THEY GET.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.822
FROM FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW IT

00:18:09.888 --> 00:18:11.690
DEPENDS ON HOW PRECISELY CONTROL

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:14.259
LANGUAGE WOULD BE -- I THINK THE

00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:16.028
THE THE OPTION WE'RE RAISING IS

00:18:16.094 --> 00:18:18.130
TO BETTER FOCUS THIS ON FOUR

00:18:18.197 --> 00:18:19.565
YEAR OLDS.

00:18:19.631 --> 00:18:23.368
AND THEN -- TO THE EXTENT THAT

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:24.803
DISTRICTS IN LOW INCOME%

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.171
COMMUNITIES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:27.473
BID FOR THESE DOLLARS TRY TO

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:28.907
FOCUS THE DOLLARS BETTER ON

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:30.209
THOSE.

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:33.111
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:33.779
OFFER.

00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:34.546
OUR DAY.

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:35.113
ANYTHING SOMETIMES THAT'S A

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:35.814
PROBLEM RIGHT WITH OUR LOW

00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:36.849
INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY DON'T

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:38.851
ALWAYS HAVE THE CAPACITY AND

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:40.252
WOULD HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BID.

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:41.286
SO.

00:18:41.353 --> 00:18:42.688
MAYBE WE NEED TO MAKE A

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:44.189
REQUIREMENT THAT WE'RE GOING

00:18:44.256 --> 00:18:49.094
AFTER OUR MOST NEEDY CHILDREN.

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:49.661
THERE'S ALSO BEEN A HELPFUL

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:51.497
CONVERSATION I THINK IN CD E..

00:18:51.563 --> 00:18:54.333
AROUND TRYING TO WORK WITH AN

00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:56.468
INTERMEDIARY NONPROFIT WHO CAN

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:58.203
HELP BILL CAPACITY.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.972
IN DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY BASED

00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:01.740
ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE AS YOU'RE

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:04.209
POINTING OUT SENATOR IT'S A VERY.

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:05.444
DISTRICTS THAT NEED THIS

00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:07.312
FUNDAMENTAL THESE CAPACITY YEAH

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:08.380
THE BILL.

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:10.916
YES OKAY WAS JUST SOME FOOD FOR

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:12.217
THOUGHT YEAH THANK YOU WELL

00:19:12.284 --> 00:19:13.285
MAYBE YOU COULD CLARIFY FOR ME

00:19:13.352 --> 00:19:15.387
WHAT BY CAPACITY WHAT WHAT ARE

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:16.755
THE LIMITING FACTORS IN.

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:18.857
SOME OF OUR POOREST COMMUNITIES

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:21.393
IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.462
T. K. PROGRAM.

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:25.297
WELL THIS IS MY FIRST RODEO IN

00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:28.400
THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SO I

00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:29.835
HOW JUDGE.

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:31.770
SO I THOUGHT IF I FIVE AS GOOD.

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:34.573
QUESTION IS A VERY INTELLIGENT

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.607
BEAR WITH ME.

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:36.375
I THINK PROBABLY OTHERS YOU'LL

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:37.209
HEAR FROM TODAY THAT ARE BETTER

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:38.544
INFORMED ON THIS I DO THINK THE

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.979
TEACHER SHORTAGE IS A PROBLEM --

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:42.581
TRYING TO FIND TEACHERS THAT

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:44.783
HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.151
YOUNG KIDS.

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:47.586
IS A BIG PROBLEM.

00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:50.822
ESPECIALLY IN MORE RURAL AND

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:53.559
HIGH NEED AREAS WERE SALARIES

00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:56.895
MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT LOWER --

00:19:56.962 --> 00:19:58.096
FACILITIES I THINK IS A STELLAR

00:19:58.163 --> 00:19:59.231
CONSTRAINT TO SOME EXTENT

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:00.832
ESPECIALLY AN AGING AREAS LIKE

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:02.534
IN THE INLAND EMPIRE CENTRAL

00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:03.468
VALLEY.

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:08.874
FAR NORTH -- BUT I IDEA I THINK

00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:10.943
THE OTHER PROBLEM HERE OUT THERE

00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:12.210
FROM SMALLER DISTRICTS.

00:20:12.277 --> 00:20:13.912
IS THAT THEY HAVE TO CONTRACT

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:15.080
OUT WITH A CONSULTANT OR THEY

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:16.548
HAVE TO FIND AN ARCHITECT OR

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:18.650
THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH FIRMS TO

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:19.551
TO PUT THESE BIDS INTO THE

00:20:19.618 --> 00:20:20.485
OFFICE PUBLIC SCHOOL

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.020
CONSTRUCTION AND IT'S NOT LIKE

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:23.455
OUT LA UNIFIED THAT HAS AN ARMY

00:20:23.522 --> 00:20:25.591
OF PEOPLE. TO TO MAKE THOSE BIDS

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:28.360
SO I THINK THAT'S THE KIND OF

00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:29.561
ORGANIZING CAPACITY THAT.

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:31.063
THE PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:33.432
AND THAT LAST PIECES OF FACTOR --

00:20:33.498 --> 00:20:35.167
ACROSS THE BOARD NOT JUST ANTI

00:20:35.233 --> 00:20:35.734
CAVE.

00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:37.703
IN OUR ENTIRE.

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:39.171
PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION

00:20:39.237 --> 00:20:43.609
PROCESS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- I

00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:45.010
HEAR THAT TOO SO THAT.

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:46.478
THOSE POINTS THAT YOU MAKE

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:48.280

00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:49.648

THAT WE REALLY HAVE COME A LONG

00:28:56.367 --> 00:28:57.569

WAYS.

00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:21.659
THAT HAVE INCREASED CASELOAD IN

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:25.396
STAGES TWO AND THREE ARE THE COW

00:29:25.463 --> 00:29:26.331
WORKS PROGRAM SENSE.

00:29:26.397 --> 00:29:26.965
OR WHEN WE INCREASE THE INCOME

00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:28.066
THRESHOLD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:29.634
NEARLY A DECADE AND ESTABLISHED

00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:31.503
A PROCESS FOR UPDATING THE

00:29:31.569 --> 00:29:32.770
THRESHOLD EVERY YEAR.

00:29:32.837 --> 00:29:34.539

AS WELL AS THE PROVIDERS.

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:46.718
PRIOR TO THESE CHANGES NEW CASES

00:29:46.784 --> 00:29:49.420
AN ATTRITION OFFSET ONE ANOTHER

00:29:49.487 --> 00:29:50.755
SINCE THE CHANGE AS ATTRITION

00:29:50.822 --> 00:29:51.556
HAS BEEN.

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:52.991
REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY ONE NEW

00:29:53.057 --> 00:29:56.895
CASES CONTINUED TO BE ADDED AS

00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:57.929
THEY HAPPEN HISTORICALLY.

00:29:57.996 --> 00:29:58.730
PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THESE

00:29:58.796 --> 00:30:00.165
CHANGES WE ARE PROJECTING THAT

00:30:00.231 --> 00:30:01.866
AVERAGE MONTHLY CASELOADS AND

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:03.368
BOTH STAGE TWO AND THREE

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:05.603
COMBINED WILL BE ABOUT 29%

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.038
HIGHER IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

00:30:07.105 --> 00:30:10.275
COMPARED TO TWENTY SIXTEEN

00:30:10.341 --> 00:30:10.875
SEVENTEEN THE LAST YEAR BEFORE

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:12.243
THAT CHANGE DIVING IN A BIT

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.845
DEEPER FOR BOTH STAGE TWO AND

00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:14.779
STAGE.

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:16.014
THREE CASELOAD INCREASE DEEPLY

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.783
EACH MONTH AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.051
EIGHTEEN STAGE TWO HAS SLOWED

00:30:20.118 --> 00:30:21.052
DOWN SOMEWHAT IN THE CURRENT

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:24.522
YEAR WAS STAGE THREE CONTINUES

00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:26.324
TO GROW AT A FAST PACE.

00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:27.592
AS A RESULT OF UPDATED DATA WELL

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:29.394
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.595
EDUCATION IS ESTIMATING.

00:30:30.662 --> 00:30:32.197
THE CURRENT CASELOAD PROJECTION

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:33.831
VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT IS INCLUDED

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:35.200
IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE ARE

00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:37.535
PROJECTING A CONTINUED INCREASE

00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:38.803
IN CASE I'D FOR BOTH PROGRAMS

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.039
AND THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:30:41.105 --> 00:30:42.340
NOTABLY IN STAGE.

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:43.608
THREE STAGE THREE RECENT DATA

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:45.143
SINCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.045
XIN CONTINUOUS AND SIGNIFICANT

00:30:47.111 --> 00:30:48.613
GROWTH SIR BUDGET YOUR

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.981
PROJECTIONS ESTIMATE A SLIGHT

00:30:50.048 --> 00:30:52.116
SLOW DOWN BUT STILL SIZEABLE

00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:53.251
INCREASING CASELOAD.

00:30:53.318 --> 00:30:55.587
WITH AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY

00:30:55.653 --> 00:30:56.054
FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.556
ADDITIONAL CASES PER MONTH.

00:30:58.623 --> 00:30:59.757
THIS TRANSLATES TO A SHORTFALL

00:30:59.824 --> 00:31:01.125
OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION AND

00:31:01.192 --> 00:31:02.627
STATES THREE COMPARED TO THE

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:03.895
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND NATIONAL

00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:05.997
AMOUNTS. FOR STAGE TWO WE ARE

00:31:06.064 --> 00:31:07.432
STILL ALLEN ANALYZING THE DATA

00:31:07.498 --> 00:31:09.567
AS IT COMES IN TO SEE IF WE

00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:10.668
WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING.

00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:11.903
WE'LL HAVE AN UPDATE LATER IN

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.839
MAY THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:16.808
ON STAGE.

TO THE KINGS CANYON STEEP GROWTH

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.044
IN STAGE THREE REALLY IS THE

00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:21.145
RESULT MAINLY OF FAMILIES AS

00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:23.481
THEY MOVE FROM STAGE TO INTO

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:25.483
STAGE.

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:28.119
THREE AND AND SO THAT CONCLUDES

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:30.355
MY PORTION OF THAT SECTION.

00:31:30.421 --> 00:31:32.190
THERE WAS A RECENT REGIONAL

00:31:32.257 --> 00:31:36.961
MARKET RATE SURVEY.

00:31:37.028 --> 00:31:38.796
IS THE OF ADMINISTRATION

00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:41.032
CONSIDERED.

00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:46.604
UPDATING THE RATES ACCORDINGLY.

00:31:46.671 --> 00:31:50.608

REGIONAL MARKET RATE SURVEY AND

00:31:56.414 --> 00:31:58.116
WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT IT AND WE

HOURS EVEN IN THE FACE OF DEMAND.

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:31.542
I THINK WE SEE BROADER ISSUES

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:35.346
AND AND THEN ACCESSING CARE

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:36.848
BECAUSE THEIR SCHEDULES TEAMS SO

00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:38.182
FREQUENTLY.

00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:39.817
AND THAT'S NOT JUST AT FOR

00:33:39.884 --> 00:33:40.985
LICENSE EXAM TO CARE THAT

00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:42.620

00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:44.922
OVERALL.

00:33:44.989 --> 00:33:47.392
AND IS THERE OF A MOVE AFOOT TO

00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:49.660
ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES

00:33:49.727 --> 00:33:50.395
OR HAVE DID YOU MENTION THAT

I DIDN'T CONNECT THE DOTS WE'VE

ACTUALLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT THEM

00:33:54.165 --> 00:33:55.700
IT WOULD BE A PRETTY BAG POLICY

00:33:55.767 --> 00:33:56.534
CHANGE.

00:33:56.601 --> 00:33:57.735
SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD

00:33:57.802 --> 00:33:59.270

THEIR SCHEDULES ARE VARIABLE.

00:34:23.161 --> 00:34:24.395
I ASSUME IS A BUDGET IMPLICATION

00:34:24.462 --> 00:34:26.998

ONLY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:49.353

I'M IN THIS BUDGET.

00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:53.424
THE THIRD POINT HERE IS A

00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:55.659
FACILITIES ARE A KEY COMPONENT --

00:39:55.726 --> 00:39:57.328
FOR EXPANDING THAT WE'VE HEARD

00:39:57.394 --> 00:39:58.529

ALSO SOME STATE -- FROM STATE --

00:40:10.908 --> 00:40:12.209
ADMINISTRATIVE THINGS THAT THEY

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:13.344

00:40:18.282 --> 00:40:19.717
ON PAGE.

00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:21.185
TEN A WE NOTE THAT WE THINK THE

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:23.053
WORK REQUIREMENT IS REASONABLE

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.555
TO PRIORITIZE SCHOOL DAYS AND

00:40:24.622 --> 00:40:26.257

FULL DAY FUND.

00:40:32.129 --> 00:40:35.065
IN UGANDA TIONAL CARE COMPONENT.

00:40:35.132 --> 00:40:35.766
AND THE LAST THING HERE IS

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:36.901
REMOVING THE WORK REQUIREMENT

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:38.736
COULD SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE

00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:39.837
COST OF THE PROGRAM.

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:41.472
I'M IT'S XPANDING -- THE POOL

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:43.841
OF ELIGIBLE OF ELIGIBLE CHILDREN

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:46.043

UP AND A FULL DAY SLOT COSTS

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:48.546
ABOUT DOUBLE THE COST OF A PART

00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:51.048
A SLOT. TO THE EXTENT THAT SOME

OF THE WOOD SOME OF THE PARTY

00:40:52.883 --> 00:40:55.452

CONVERTED TO FULL THEY THOUGHT

00:41:00.057 --> 00:41:01.725
IT WOULD COST AN ADDITIONAL

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:02.293
THREE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION

00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:04.428

AND SO AS WE LOOK AT ALL OF THIS

00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:36.833
WE KNOW THAT MET THAT DEMAND IS

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:37.734
THAT PAY STATE WE THINK THAT

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:39.936
PAIRING THIS THOUGHT INCREASE

00:50:40.003 --> 00:50:40.570
WITH THE FACILITIES WILL HELP A

00:50:40.637 --> 00:50:41.638
LOT.

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:42.973
AND THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE HEAR

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:44.474
A LOT IS THE WORK FORCE WILL BE

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:46.176
ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT WHEN WITH

00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:49.012
ALL OF YOU IN A LITTLE BIT.

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:50.881
SO I THINK IT WILL CONCLUDE MY

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:51.748
REMARKS UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:53.150
QUESTIONS WELL MAYBE YOU YOU

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:54.284
PROBABLY COVER THIS COULD YOU

00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:56.953
JUST GO BACK OVER FOR ME THE

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.321
MAYBE RESPOND TO THE LA IS

00:50:58.388 --> 00:51:00.857
CONCERNED ABOUT THE WORK

00:51:00.924 --> 00:51:02.559
REQUIREMENT ISSUE. FOR COULD

00:51:02.626 --> 00:51:04.761
SOMEONE [inaudible]

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:06.196
SURE.

00:51:06.263 --> 00:51:08.732
SO THE ADMINISTRATION'S ONE OF

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:10.400
THE MEASURES BIG GOALS FOR THIS

00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:11.835
ENTIRE PACKAGE IS INCREASING

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:13.403
ACCESS TO THE SUBSIDIZED

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:16.106
CHILDCARE PROGRAMS FOR OUR MOST.

00:51:16.173 --> 00:51:17.774
VULNERABLE YOUNGEST LEARNERS SO

00:51:17.841 --> 00:51:19.242
REMOVING THE WORK REQUIREMENTS.

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:21.344
IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT WOULD

00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:23.280
REALLY HELP FAMILIES WHO NEED

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:24.581
SUPPORT FROM THESE PROGRAMS AND

00:51:24.648 --> 00:51:26.416
ARE FACING MORE OF THOSE

00:51:26.483 --> 00:51:29.119
INTERMITTENT OF WORK SCHEDULES.

00:51:29.186 --> 00:51:30.153
AND REALLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:31.421
ACCESS THE PROGRAMS THEY WOULD

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:33.590
BE ABLE TO HAVE EXPANDED ACCESS

00:51:33.657 --> 00:51:35.025
SPEAK BY REMOVING THE WORK

00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:36.560
REQUIREMENT SO THAT IS THE MAIN

00:51:36.626 --> 00:51:38.361
MOTIVATION BEHIND.

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:39.763
THIS PARTICULAR CHANGE HOW HOW

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.198
DOES THAT IMPACT HOW DOES THAT

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:43.633
INTERFACE WITH THE AVAILABILITY

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:47.904
OF SLOTS I MEAN ARE YOU I THINK

00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:49.172
ALEJO'S CONCERN WAS.

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:50.340
IF YOU ELIMINATE THE WORK

00:51:50.407 --> 00:51:51.007
REQUIREMENT.

00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:52.075
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE FOLKS

00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:55.512
COMPETING FOR THE SAME NUMBER OF

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:56.546
FLOOD STOOD I UNDERSTAND IT

00:51:56.613 --> 00:51:58.782
CORRECTLY.

00:51:58.849 --> 00:52:00.484
AND THAT COULD.

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:03.653
HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR ON

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.089
OUR OUR GOAL.

00:52:06.156 --> 00:52:07.991
IN MY UNDERSTANDING A GROUP

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:10.293
MEMBER.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.562
YES WE BELIEVE THAT BY TAKING

00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:14.097
AWAY THE WORK REQUIREMENTS GOING

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:15.866
TO RESULT IN MUCH BETTER RESULTS

00:52:15.932 --> 00:52:17.634
FOR OUR FAMILIES THAT WOULD

00:52:17.701 --> 00:52:19.035
OFFSET SOME OF THESE ADVERSE.

00:52:19.102 --> 00:52:20.770
OBSERVATIONS ARE BEING MADE BY

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:23.907
THE LA.

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.842
WELL WHAT ABOUT THE THE

00:52:25.909 --> 00:52:27.210
INJECTION OF AN INCREASED NUMBER

00:52:27.277 --> 00:52:36.987
OF THE THIRTY THOUSAND WELL IN

00:52:37.053 --> 00:52:40.991
MY NUMBER. THIRTY THOUSAND ****

00:52:41.057 --> 00:52:44.261
OVER THREE YEARS TO SERVE THE

00:52:44.327 --> 00:52:46.429
LOW INCOME FORTY FOUR YEAR OLD.

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:47.597
OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD THE

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:49.266
CONCERNED AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:55.105
TOO MUCH IN TWO SHORT OF TIME.

00:52:55.171 --> 00:52:57.641
I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE NUMBER

00:52:57.707 --> 00:52:59.276
OF SLOTS SO WE ARE PROPOSING IT

00:52:59.342 --> 00:53:01.778
IS IN A SLOW AND METHODICAL WAY

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:03.613
IT IS TEN THOUSAND SLOTS.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.649
EACH YEAR AND I WOULD I WOULD

00:53:05.715 --> 00:53:07.384
ALSO ADD THAT IT IS IN

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:08.385
CONJUNCTION WITH SOME OF OUR

00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:09.920
OTHER PROPOSALS TO HELP

00:53:09.986 --> 00:53:12.722
STRENGTHEN THE NTIRE SYSTEM AS

00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:13.323
IS EXPANSION CONTINUES SO WITH

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:14.958
THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE

00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:16.192
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT DOLLARS IN

00:53:16.259 --> 00:53:17.294
THE EXPANSION.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.562
EXPANSION OF THE PRESCHOOLS LOTS

00:53:18.628 --> 00:53:20.530
WE BELIEVE THAT AS WE ALL WORK

00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:21.865
TOGETHER IT WILL HELP CREATE

00:53:21.932 --> 00:53:24.134
THAT FOUNDATION THAT WE NEED TO

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.536
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT A SUSTAINABLE

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:28.271
EXPANSION OF SLOTS.

00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:29.773
AND WE WHICH IS SAD BECAUSE WE

00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:31.107
HAVE SEEN THAT DEMAND FROM THE

00:53:31.174 --> 00:53:32.709
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:34.377
PROVIDE MORE PRESCHOOL AND TO

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:35.879
PROVIDE THE FULL DAY.

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:37.113
THERE'S A LOT TO CONSIDER AROUND

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.882
HOW TO SUPPORT THAT AND HOW TO

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:40.584
ADDRESS EQUITY ISSUES ACROSS THE

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:42.152
STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:43.386
ACTUALLY HAVE A HIGH QUALITY

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:44.688
PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS.

00:53:44.754 --> 00:53:45.922
EVERYWHERE SO FAMILIES CAN

00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:47.591
ACCESS THEM THE THINGS DE

00:53:47.657 --> 00:53:49.793
CONSIDER AROUND ELECTRONIC

00:53:49.859 --> 00:53:51.995
MONITOR TEEN ELECTRONIC OR PHASE

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:52.862
THINGS THAT WOULD REALLY MAKE IT

00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:54.764
EASIER ON THE CONTRACTORS AND

00:53:54.831 --> 00:53:55.999
EASIER ON THE DEPARTMENT ASWE

00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:57.133
HAVE TO ADDRESS A LOT OF

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.234
APPLICATIONS.

00:53:58.301 --> 00:54:00.003
WE'VE ALSO OBSERVE THAT FOR

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.705
EXISTING CONTRACTORS THAT CAN

00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:03.506
TAKE THEM A LITTLE BIT OF TIME.

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:04.741
TO BE AWARDED THERE'S SOMETHING

00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:06.610
AROUND HIRING STAFF REALLY

00:54:06.676 --> 00:54:08.011
MAKING SURE THEY GET THAT

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:09.613
PROGRAM LICENSED IN UP AND GOING.

00:54:09.679 --> 00:54:11.181
FOR BRAND NEW CONTRACTORS WHO'VE

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:13.116
NEVER WORKED WITH CD I CAN TAKE

00:54:13.183 --> 00:54:14.684
A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO ACTUALLY

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:16.052
UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO BUSINESS

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:17.120
WITH THE STATE.

00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:18.588
WE FEEL THAT ALL PROGRAMS

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:20.056
ESPECIALLY THIS NEW ONES WOULD

00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:21.491
BENEFIT FROM MARCUS TECHNICAL

00:54:21.558 --> 00:54:22.759
ASSISTANCE.

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:24.661
AND TRAINING AND SUPPORT ON HOW

00:54:24.728 --> 00:54:25.729
TO IMPLEMENT A STATE CONTRACT

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:27.297
HOW TO ENSURE GOOD STEWARDSHIP

00:54:27.364 --> 00:54:29.733
OF THE PUBLIC FUNDS AND MOST

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:30.734
IMPORTANTLY HOW TO BEST SUPPORT

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.868
THE CHILDREN FAMILIES IN THIS

00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:33.036
PROGRAM.

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:33.770
THEY'RE REALLY GETTING

00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:35.438
ADDITIONAL TRAINING TECHNICAL

00:54:35.505 --> 00:54:37.374
ASSISTANCE BOTH AHEAD OF TIME TO

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.342
HELP ADDRESSES QUESTIONS

00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:41.111
CONCERNS BEFORE AN RV WOULD BE

00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:42.145
RELEASED.

00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:43.647
AND THEN SUPPORTING PROGRAMS AS

00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:48.718
THEY WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD WAY

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:50.487
A STRONG WAY TO CONSIDERING

00:54:50.553 --> 00:54:52.055
COMPANY KNOWS THOUGHT INCREASES

00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:52.889
TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN BE

00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:54.391
SUCCESSFUL AS WE MOVE FORWARD

00:54:54.457 --> 00:54:57.727
WITH THAT. TO A CD HAS A PLAN.

00:54:57.794 --> 00:54:59.329
TO IMPLEMENT THE TEN THOUSAND

EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY.

00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:04.134
WE FEEL THAT GETTING OUT IN

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.135
FRONT OF IT WITH ADDITIONAL

00:55:05.201 --> 00:55:07.504
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WOULD BE

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:07.904
GOOD.

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:09.105
WE DO FEEL THAT IF WE REALLY

00:55:09.172 --> 00:55:11.741
ESPECIALLY AS WE KEEP INCREASING

00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:12.509
WHEN WE WOULD NEED TO INCREASE

00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:14.844
THAT OTHER PIECES OF OUR SUPPORT.

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:16.913
SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FULLY TO

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:19.582
AT SO IS THAT PEACE IN INCLUDED

00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:21.317
IN THE BUDGET SOMEWHERE.

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:22.919
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE IN

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:24.754
THE FACE OF THE AS WE MOVE

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:26.423
THROUGH THIS IS AN OPEN ITEM SO

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:27.691
WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSATION

00:55:27.757 --> 00:55:28.358
ABOUT IT.

00:55:28.425 --> 00:55:29.559
AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE

00:55:29.626 --> 00:55:31.294
CONCLUSION OF THIS PHASE OF OUR

00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:33.663
BUDGET KABUKI DANCE.

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.598
THAT THAT ALL THE PIECES OF THE

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:37.867
BUDGET OR ARE WORKING TOGETHER

00:55:37.934 --> 00:55:40.103
TO IN FACT IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:42.539
TO ADD THIRTY THOUSAND PLUS OVER

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:43.907
THREE YEARS SO. TO SAY THAT

00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:45.275
THAT'S A GOAL AND WE PUT IT IN

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:46.676
THE BUDGET WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:55:46.743 --> 00:55:50.280
THE CD HAS A FUNDING NECESSARY.

00:55:50.346 --> 00:55:50.914
TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WORKS

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:51.581
AND THAT WAS.

00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:54.684
THAT WAS MY THE GENESIS OF MY

00:55:54.751 --> 00:55:58.021
QUESTION.

00:55:58.088 --> 00:55:59.089

THAT WAS I GUESS THAT WAS A

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:01.925
QUESTION BUT I GUESS IT COULD BE

00:56:01.991 --> 00:56:03.793
A STATEMENT IF YOU WANT TO WAIT

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.395
NANCE RELATED.

I I CAN COMMENT ON SO -- WE WE

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:09.766
DEFINITELY AGREE FROM THE

ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE WE

00:56:11.167 --> 00:56:12.769

THERE ARE.

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:23.913
THERE IS A PROPOSITION IN THE

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.049
BUDGET TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF

00:56:26.116 --> 00:56:27.383
POSITIONS THAT WE'RE GIVING TO

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:28.551

WORKLOAD WITH ALL THESE VARIOUS

00:56:36.359 --> 00:56:37.994
BUDGET PROPOSALS.

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:44.501
A CONCERN THAT IF WE ELIMINATE

00:56:44.567 --> 00:56:46.703
THE WORK REQUIREMENT AS PROPOSED

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:48.438
THAT WE MIGHT BE ADVANTAGE IN

00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:50.573
THE WRONG FAMILIES THAT WE MIGHT

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.475
BE ADVANTAGE IN FAMILIES WHERE

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:54.577
THERE'S ONLY ONE WORKING PARENT.

00:56:54.644 --> 00:56:57.213
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.616
THE THE PARENTS WHO HAVE ARE

00:56:59.682 --> 00:57:00.583
BOTH WORKING.

THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT PARK

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:02.285
WERE PRIORITIZING SO IS THERE

00:57:02.352 --> 00:57:04.120
ANY CONCERN THAT BY ELIMINATING.

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:08.258
THE WORK REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD

00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:09.559
BE A PROBLEM.

00:57:09.626 --> 00:57:10.160
THAT THAT IS A CONCERN FOR THE

00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:10.760
WAY THAT THE STATE PRESCHOOL

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:13.163
PRIORITIZATION IS IS CURRENTLY

00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:14.297
IN LAW IS IT'S AN AD CODE OF HOW

00:57:14.364 --> 00:57:16.099
FAMILIES WILL BE PRIORITIZE

00:57:16.166 --> 00:57:17.467
FIRST -- TO WITH FAMILIES

00:57:17.534 --> 00:57:19.736
REFERRED BY CPS ON SECOND TO

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:21.004
FOUR YEAR OLDS BY LOWEST INCOME

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:23.239
TO HIGHEST INCOME AND THEN THREE

00:57:23.306 --> 00:57:24.808
YEAR OLDS -- BY INCOME I'M SO IN

00:57:24.874 --> 00:57:26.810
WITHOUT CURRENT PRIORITIZATION

00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:28.444
SCHEDULE ON THE THE GOVERNOR'S

00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:29.512
BUDGET IN AMEND THAT

00:57:29.579 --> 00:57:30.947
PRIORITIZATION THAT CURRENT

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:34.050
PRIVATIZATION I THINK YOUR

00:57:34.117 --> 00:57:35.084
CONCERN IS VALID.

00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:35.985
SO SO I WOULD JUST LIKE US TO

00:57:36.052 --> 00:57:36.719
LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO

00:57:36.786 --> 00:57:37.453
MAKE SURE WE'RE HELPING THE

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.722
FAMILIES THAT NEED HELP MOST.

00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:41.925
OF AND THEN SECONDLY.

00:57:41.991 --> 00:57:43.459
I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT -- I

00:57:43.526 --> 00:57:45.195
THINK THAT FINANCE I THINK THAT

00:57:45.261 --> 00:57:47.630
THAT IS A GOOD IDEA TO ONLY

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:51.634
INCREASE THE RESCHOOL SLOTS BY

00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:52.268
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BECAUSE WE

00:57:52.335 --> 00:57:53.903
DON'T USE ALL THE SLOTS THAT

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:55.872
WERE GIVEN EVERY YEAR CORRECT.

00:57:55.939 --> 00:57:57.106
DON'T MANY OF THEM GO UNUSED

00:57:57.173 --> 00:57:58.341
BECAUSE MY CONCERN WAS WITH THE

00:57:58.408 --> 00:58:01.277
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WINE TO ADD.

00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:03.213
TEN THOUSAND WE WOULDN'T WE ARE

00:58:03.279 --> 00:58:04.480
USING EVERYTHING WE HAVE NOW

00:58:04.547 --> 00:58:04.848
[inaudible]


00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:07.417
SO [inaudible]

00:58:07.483 --> 00:58:08.651
ARE ARE WE USING ALL THE SLOTS

00:58:08.718 --> 00:58:10.186
WE HAVE AVAILABLE.

00:58:10.253 --> 00:58:11.754
BUT YOU'RE CORRECT THERE IS SOME --

00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:12.989
THERE ARE SOME SAVING THE STATE

00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:13.823
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM NOW.

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:15.859
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:17.727
ARE PUTTING THE SLOTS WERE WE

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:18.361
MOST NEED THEM [inaudible]

00:58:18.428 --> 00:58:21.197
THAT'S ALL.

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:22.599
THE MAJORITY OF THE THOUGHTS

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.200
THAT HAVE STUCK ON AND USE THAT

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:25.668
WOULD BE PUTTING OUT AGAIN OUR

00:58:25.735 --> 00:58:27.737
FOR SPECIFIC FOR ALLIE ACE ONLY.

00:58:27.804 --> 00:58:29.372
AND SO THE PART THAT'S AVAILABLE

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:31.975
FOR FULL DAY FULL YEAR COMMUNITY

00:58:32.041 --> 00:58:34.344
BASED ORGANIZATIONS THOSE ALWAYS

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:37.714
HAVE A MORE DEMAND THAN WE HAVE

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:38.948
FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THEM.

00:58:39.015 --> 00:58:40.850
SO COULD WE MOVE. ONE TO THE

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:42.685
OTHER.

00:58:42.752 --> 00:58:44.387
I MEAN  KNOW ONCE CONSIDERABLY

00:58:44.454 --> 00:58:46.723
MORE EXPENSIVE BUT I I JUST

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:48.691
THINK WE NEED TO FIND A WAY. TO

00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:50.727
GET TO WHERE FAMILIES NEED US

00:58:50.793 --> 00:58:52.262
AND NOT LEAVE MONEY ON THE TABLE

00:58:52.328 --> 00:58:53.696
SO TO SPEAK WITH SLOTS BEING

00:58:53.763 --> 00:58:55.999
UNFILLED.

00:58:56.065 --> 00:58:57.400
CERTAINLY PLEASE TEN THOUSAND

00:58:57.467 --> 00:58:58.935
SLOTS ON THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED

00:58:59.002 --> 00:59:00.003
IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET

00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:02.205
ART SPECIFICALLY FOR A NON.

00:59:02.272 --> 00:59:03.840
LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES THEIR

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:05.441
FUNDED BY NON PROPOSITION NINETY

00:59:05.508 --> 00:59:07.243
DOLLARS SO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:09.045
IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE -- THAT MISS

00:59:09.112 --> 00:59:11.547
NOBLE MORGAN POINTED OUT. TO TO

00:59:11.614 --> 00:59:12.649
SHOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PENT

00:59:12.715 --> 00:59:14.918
UP DEMAND FOR SLOTS AT NON LOCAL

00:59:14.984 --> 00:59:17.487
EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES FOOD IS

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:18.588
TARGETED IN THAT WAY.

00:59:18.655 --> 00:59:19.756
OKAY THANK YOU ONE ONE THING I

00:59:19.822 --> 00:59:21.090
WILL NOTE ON YOUR ON YOUR

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:22.392
COMMENT - ADDRESSING STATE

00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:23.092
PRESCHOOL THROUGH ONE FUNDING

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:24.294
SOURCE WOULD ADDRESS YOUR

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.595
CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING SAVINGS

00:59:25.662 --> 00:59:26.829
THAT ARE ONLY EXPLICITLY

00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:28.631
EARMARKED FOR ELEAZAR ONE

00:59:28.698 --> 00:59:29.432
FUNDING SOURCE WOULDN'T YOUR

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:31.601
MARK THE FUNDS FOR SPECIFIC

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:33.536
AGENCY OR FOR SPECIFIC ENTITIES

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:38.107
TO USE THE STATE PRESCHOOL SLOT

00:59:38.174 --> 00:59:38.708
SO THAT WE COULD BE ADDRESSED

00:59:38.775 --> 00:59:39.142
THAT WAY [inaudible]

00:59:39.208 --> 00:59:40.944
THANK YOU.

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:44.814
ANYTHING FURTHER PANELS IN THIS.

00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:46.049
ONE ANYTHING FURTHER IN A QUOTE

00:59:46.115 --> 00:59:47.450
FOR THE QUESTION SEVERAL I JUST

00:59:47.517 --> 00:59:49.352
WANTED TO I WANT TO GET YOUR

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:52.155
TAKE ON ELIGIBILITY MMA MAYBE I

00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:53.122
MEAN THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF

00:59:53.189 --> 00:59:54.657
LOOKING AT IT RIGHT YOU KNOW --

00:59:54.724 --> 00:59:56.492
WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT WE MAY BE

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:57.760
LEAVING THINGS ON THE TABLE BUT

00:59:57.827 --> 00:59:59.996
THE FLIP SIDE IS ON WINDOWS AND

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:04.300
INCREDIBLE DEMAND OUT THERE.

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:07.804
AND I WONDER -- YOU KNOW IT.

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:08.905
IN THIS CAN OPEN UP OF A CAN OF

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:11.007
WORMS IN TERMS OF COST BUT AND

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:12.308
BUT IS THERE.

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:13.843
AT A TIME TO LOOK.

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:14.477
TAKE A GIVEN THE EVER INCREASING

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:16.746
COST OF LIVING FOR EVERYBODY

01:00:16.813 --> 01:00:18.448
HOUSING EVERYTHING ELSE. TO

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:21.150
EXPAND ELIGIBILITY POLL FURTHER

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:22.618
AND IF SO WHERE IS THAT

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:23.619
CONVERSATION GOING WHERE WOULD

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:25.188
WE TWEAK IT WORK YOU KNOW HOW

01:00:25.254 --> 01:00:28.124
HOW WOULD WE AND IT IS IT.

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:29.325
IS THAT CONVERSATION HAPPENING

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:33.029
ALL AND AND AND LIVING YOUR

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:36.199
THOUGHTS ON THAT.

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:37.500
JUST TO CLARIFY ARE YOU ARE YOU

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:39.469
SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO INCOME

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:42.805
ELIGIBILITY YEAH YEAH EXACTLY.

01:00:42.872 --> 01:00:44.307
WE DID INCREASE IN THIS PAST

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:46.142
BUDGET YEAR THAT WILL TAKE PLACE

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:47.543
AND STARTING JULY FIRST THAT

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.545
WENT FROM 70% OF STATE MEDIAN

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:51.280
INCOME TO COMMAND.

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:55.718
ALL THE WAY UP 285% THAT'S A

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:57.120
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE.

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:59.022
NHà IS THERE OKAY.

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:02.058
A. N. -- THE DROUGHT.

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:03.593
I GUESS DOES THAT TAKE INTO

01:01:03.659 --> 01:01:05.395
ACCOUNT COST OF LIVING FROM

01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:09.065
REGION TO REGION.

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:10.500
SO IT'S BASED ON STATE MEDIUM

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:12.602
INCOME SO IT TAKES SO WHEN SO IT

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:13.736
IS ACTION AT THE FEDERAL

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:15.471
REQUIREMENT TO BASE IT ON THE

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:17.607
STATE MEDIAN INCOME SO -- OF

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:18.708
LOOKING AT A FEDERAL LEVEL IT

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.710
TAKES AN ACCOUNT THAT CALIFORNIA

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:21.511
HAS A HIGHER COST OF LIVING IN

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.046
ANOTHER PLACE BUT IT DOESN'T DO

01:01:23.112 --> 01:01:24.981
IT GEOGRAPHICALLY -- AMONG THE

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:26.682
HIGHER COST COUNTIES RELATIVE TO

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:27.350
LOWER COST AND THE REASON I ASK

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:28.785
THAT IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU GOT

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:33.790
FOLKS LIVING IN OUR CITIES WHO.

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:35.324
ARE READY ARE SPENDING.

01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:35.958
YOU KNOW A HALF OF THEIR INCOMES

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:36.426
ON HOUSING [inaudible]

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:40.129
AND CHEN ACOSTA LIVING IS SOAKED

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:41.898
THROUGH THE ROOF AND THEN HAVING

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:44.033
TO KID YOU KNOW ADDS ALL SORTS

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:44.367
OF ADDITIONAL.

01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:47.970
PRESSURES -- AND THE COST.

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:49.172
FOR YOU.

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:51.307
MARKET RATE CHILD CARE IS SO

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:52.508
EXPENSIVE.

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:54.143
SO I IT JUST KINDA MAKES ME

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.445
WONDER WHETHER THERE OUGHT TO BE

01:01:55.511 --> 01:01:57.713
A LITTLE BIT EXTRA FLEXIBILITY

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.449
GIVEN TO THOSE PEOPLE LIVING IN.

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:00.116
BUT IF WE HIGH COST AREAS OF THE

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:01.384
STATE.

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:03.553
I WHICH COULD WE DO THROUGH

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:06.756
EXPECT EXPANDING -- ARE HAVE

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:08.791
MORE A. P. VOUCHERS.

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:14.130
WOULD THAT HELP IS CONCERNED.

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:16.699
IF I COULD EITHER I WROTE THE LA

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:18.034
I THINK SO I THINK WE DO HAVE --

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:19.335
WANT TO CARVE A DIFFERENT IN

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:20.203
TERMS OF COST OF LIVING SO WE'D

01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:21.504
IN TERMS OF INCOME ELIGIBILITY

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.806
LOOKING AT A FAMILIES INCOME WE

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:24.307
DO NOT HAVE A REGIONALLY

01:02:24.373 --> 01:02:28.244
ADJUSTED -- CHRIS SECRETARY AS

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:31.280
WE HAVE. 185% STATE ME IN INCOME

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:32.348
WE DO IT JUST FOR A FAMILY A

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.150
FAMILY SIZE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:35.017
MONTH ALL DOUBLE THAT IS NOT

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:36.285
JUST ACROSS THE STATE.

01:02:36.352 --> 01:02:37.620
AND SO THAT DOES MEAN THAT IF

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:38.588
YOU'RE NOT A HIGHER COST OF

01:02:38.654 --> 01:02:40.289
LIVING AREA MAYBE THAT.

01:02:40.356 --> 01:02:41.457
THERE THERE'VE BEEN SOME GOOD

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:42.692
NEWS AND SOME OF THOSE AREAS

01:02:42.758 --> 01:02:43.593
MAYBE SOME FAMILIES.

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:45.428
SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE THAT ARE NOT

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:47.296
WHERE WE DO I JUST FOR COST OF

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:49.532
LIVING IS ON THE OR WE JUST FOR

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:51.367
REGIONAL COST IS ON THE THE COST

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:52.301
OF THE PROGRAM ITSELF THE

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:54.770
VOUCHERS -- ARE ARE PROVIDED

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:56.272
BASED ON REGIONAL MARKET RATE SO

01:02:56.339 --> 01:03:03.212
IF YOUR IF YOU'RE AT A FAMILY

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:07.350
THAT'S GOING -- TO GET OUT GET A

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:09.051
CENTER SLOT IN THE BAY AREA

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:10.486
VERSES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:11.154
THAT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:11.721
EFFECT ON YOU BECAUSE WE'RE

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:14.023
PAYING WHATEVER THE COST IS --

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:14.624
BASED ON THAT REGIONAL MARKETS

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:15.992
RIGHT SO THERE ARE THOSE THOSE

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:16.926
DIFFERENCES THERE I THINK THE

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:18.127
THE ISSUE THAT.

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:18.928
THE ISSUE OF TRYING TO FIGURE

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:24.100
OUT HOW HOW -- TO SERVICE CENTER

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.168
IS IT IS A DIFFICULT ONE WE HAVE.

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:25.868
RECENTLY CHANGE THE INCOME

01:03:25.935 --> 01:03:26.903
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND ALSO

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:28.004
THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME IS NOW

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:29.105
IN STATUTE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:32.441
ADJUSTED AS WE GET NEW -- DATA

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:33.809
FROM NEW NEW INCOME EVERY YEAR

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:34.777
SO THERE IS A BUILT IN MECHANISM

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:36.412
WHERE IT WON'T BE AS IT WAS IN

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:37.380
THE PAST WHERE.

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:38.714
WE HAVE FOR A LONG TIME WE WERE

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:40.449
USING THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE

01:03:40.516 --> 01:03:42.718
MEDIAN INCOME -- TO TO TO

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:44.086
DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY THAT

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:45.421
PROBLEM HAS BEEN FIXED IN COURT

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:46.355
AS WE ARE GOING TO BE UPDATING

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:48.457
IT BUT THE THE THE PLACE WHERE

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:48.991
WE HAVEN'T.

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:51.127
OUT THERE ISN'T ANY SPECIFIC --

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:52.995
ISSUE-- CHANGES RELATED TO THE

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:55.932
REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE IN

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:57.633
THE INCOME OF THE FAMILIES.

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.701
YEAH I JUST THINK THAT'S A

01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:00.836
PROBLEM I I UNDERSTAND THAT MAY

01:04:00.903 --> 01:04:02.338
ADD A WHOLE THEIR LAYER OF

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:03.539
COMPLICATION IN YOUR MAYBE IT'S

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:05.474
NOT WORTH OPEN A CAN OF WORMS

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:07.843
BUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF DISCUSSION

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:08.811
ON THIS BUILDING IN OTHER

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:10.580
COMMITTEES ABOUT -- THE THE

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:12.348
RELENTLESS COST OF LIVING

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:13.950
PRESSURES ON PEOPLE IT'S

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:15.284
INJECTED INTO OUR WHOLE

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:16.485
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOUSING AND

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:18.221
WE'RE ACTUALLY CONTEMPLATED

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:20.389
PRETTY RADICAL STUFF -- IN THAT

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:21.157
SPACE AND IT IT JUST MAKES ME

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:22.858
YOU KNOW.

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:25.061
IN A BATTLE BABY MYSELF AND I'M

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:26.862
I'M I'M NOW FACING ALL NEW

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:32.368
ECONOMIC REALITIES FOR SO -- AND

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:33.002
NOT THAT I MEAN TO BE ELIGIBLE

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:34.203
FOR IN THESE PROGRAMS BUT BUT

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.038
BUT YOU KNOW -- BUT IT BUT IT

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:38.708
CERTAINLY DOES AND YOU KNOW I

01:04:38.774 --> 01:04:39.842
I'VE I'M JUST GETTING OF A REAL

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.077
CRASH COURSE AND AND ALL THE

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:41.911
COSTS ASSOCIATED AS I AS I TRY

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:43.879
TO PLAN OUT FOR THE FUTURE AND

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.948
AND I I REALLY DO WORRY ABOUT --

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:47.216
WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR FAMILIES THAT

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.452
ARE LIVING IN IN IN PARTS OF LOS

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:50.653
ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE SAN

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.521
FRANCISCO ETCETERA THAT -- THAT

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:53.122
ARE JUST BARELY STRUGGLING TO

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:54.423
MAKE IT.

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:55.558
I IN IN AN EXPENSIVE PART OF THE

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:56.692
WORLD.

01:04:56.759 --> 01:04:58.494
I AND AND NOW THEY HAVE A KID

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:00.529
AND AND WHEN WE'RE NOT PROVIDING

01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:01.264
KIND OF A LITTLE BIT EXTRA HELP

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:02.131
FOR THEM.

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:03.399
I GET I GET THAT THE

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:04.934
REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS A LITTLE

01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:06.502
BIT BETTER FOR THE PROVIDER

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:09.772
THAT'S FANTASTIC BUT I I THINK

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:10.539
THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY GOOD

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:11.607
FOLKS BEING LEFT ON THE TABLE

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:13.276
HERE SO WE TALK ABOUT SLOTS NOT

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:13.943
BEING FILLED.

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.611
MAKES ME WONDER WHAT IS AN

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:16.912
OPPORTUNITY THERE TO HELP.

01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:18.281
PEOPLE IN HIGH COST AREAS THAT

01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:21.050
MIGHT BE REALLY STRUGGLING.

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:22.685
THAT WAS EXACTLY WHY WE ADDRESS

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:24.420
THAT STATE MEANING COME LAST

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:25.187
YEAR SO BEFORE THEY WOULD COME

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:27.990
IN AT 70%.

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:29.659
AND THEN THEY WOULD EXIT EIGHTY

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:30.760
FIVE BUT INSTEAD WE SIDE -- IT

01:05:30.826 --> 01:05:31.727
WAS CHANGED SO THEY COULD COME

01:05:31.794 --> 01:05:34.030
IN AT EIGHTY FIVE AND THEN ACTS

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:34.463
THAT.

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:36.565
SAID THAT WAS -- SPECIFICALLY

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:39.101
FOR THE HIGHER COST LEVINE AREAS

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:41.804
THAT'S GREAT.

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:43.306
LET ME ASK ONE FINAL QUESTION

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:46.175
AND I'VE MET CITY I'M SURE YOU --

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:47.710
YOU SAID THIS AND I MISSED IT.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:49.312
WITH THE THIRTY THOUSAND SLOTS

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:50.446
OVER THREE YEARS TO THE NON

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:52.615
ELLIE A IS WHAT'S WHAT'S THE

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:54.450
DEMAND I MEAN WHAT'S THE UNMET

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:55.451
DEMAND.

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:57.320
IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION.

01:05:57.386 --> 01:05:58.654
DO WE KNOW NUMBER OF CHILDREN

01:05:58.721 --> 01:05:59.989
WHO WOULD STILL BE ELIGIBLE WHO

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:01.991
HAVEN'T WHO ARE ELIGIBLE BUT

01:06:02.058 --> 01:06:04.327
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SECURE OF

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:07.129
THE FREE SCHOOL OF FULL TIME FOR

01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:09.665
ME TO SUGGEST WE HAVE THAT DATA.

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.133
I I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.102
FIGURE OUT HOW FAR WE'RE GOING

01:06:13.169 --> 01:06:15.271
TO GET WITH THE THIRTY THOUSAND

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:16.138
THERE FOR JUST THE KERN AT THE

01:06:16.205 --> 01:06:17.373
FOUR YEAR OLDS.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.943
WE HAVE A A HUNDRED NINETY ONE

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:22.111
THOUSAND WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FRIEND

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:24.647
LOW INCOME AND WORKING FAMILIES.

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:26.515
WHEREAS WE WOULD HAVE THREE

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:28.117
HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND WHO

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:29.251
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE IF WE JUST

01:06:29.318 --> 01:06:31.020
LOOKED AT INCOME WE CURRENTLY

01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:33.389
SERVE A HUNDRED AND TWELVE

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:34.357
THOUSAND IF YOU LOOK AT THREE

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:36.025
HUNDRED AND SIX VERSUS A HUNDRED

01:06:36.092 --> 01:06:37.927
AND TWELVE THOUSAND THEY'RE

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:40.963
STILL IT DEFINITELY AT LARGE

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:41.430
SHARE OF FAMILIES WHO.

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:43.366
ARE ELIGIBLE. ONE OF HIS PIECES

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:44.100
I SIDE WITH WE REALLY WANT TO

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:44.834
WORK ON WHERE PROGRAMS ARE

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.669
ACROSS THE STATE AND MAKE SURE

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:47.903
THAT THERE'S MORE ACCESS AND

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:48.938
COMMUNITIES THAT TYPICALLY

01:06:49.004 --> 01:06:50.406
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE.

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:51.974
TO OFFER THE CALIFORNIA STATE

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:53.042
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM.

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:56.312
SO EVEN WITH THE EVEN WITH THE

01:06:56.379 --> 01:07:00.082
THE HUNDRED NINETY ONE THOUSAND

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:00.649
THIRTY THOUSAND NOT GOING TO

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:02.518
FILL THE NEED.

01:07:02.585 --> 01:07:05.721
CORRECT -- THAT RAIN.

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:06.689
COULD COULD I COULD I THINK MY

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:08.257
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE THIRTY

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:09.492
DOLLARS IN.

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:11.026
A NUMBER THAT THAT IS A PROPOSED

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:12.094
BY THE ADMINISTRATION WAS AN

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:13.496
ESTIMATE FROM THEM ON THE NOT

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:15.431
THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL SLOTS

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:17.333
THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. TO SERVE.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.501
TO TAP ENOUGH LOTS OF THAT YOU

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:19.735
WOULD SERVE ALL LOW INCOME FOUR

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:21.303
YEAR OLDS IN THE STATE NOW THE

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:22.605
NUMBERS ARE NOT.

01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:24.774
QUITE A THE THING I THINK THAT

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:25.441
SEAT NUMBERS AT THE THE AFTER TO

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:25.641
HIRE.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.009
THE COUPLE REASONS WHY THAT

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:28.010
THOSE NUMBERS ARE DIFFERENT ONE

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:30.413
IS THAT THE THAT THERE ARE GOING

01:07:30.479 --> 01:07:31.080
TO BE.

01:07:31.147 --> 01:07:31.814
THERE ARE SOME CHILDREN WHO FOR

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:32.648
EXAMPLE ARE ENROLLED IN HEAD

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.617
START PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:36.185
FEDERALLY RUN THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:36.919
TO HAVE A GOOD WE DON'T DO A

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:38.654
GOOD JOB OF COMBINING DATA

01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:40.022
SOURCES SO THAT WE CAN.

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:40.990
UNDERSTAND HOW MANY OF THOSE

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:45.161
HEAD START STUDENTS -- ARE ARE

01:07:45.227 --> 01:07:45.761
BEING SERVED THERE IN ARE NOT

01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:46.562
ALSO.

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:47.663
SERVED AS THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:48.964
AND THEN THERE IS WITH ALMOST

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:51.801
ANY BOB PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AT ANY

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:53.169
OF THE OF THESE KINDS OF EARLY.

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:53.769
EDUCATION PROGRAMS ACROSS THE

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:56.338
COUNTRY -- YOU DON'T HAVE ALL A

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:58.240
100% OF ELIGIBLE FAMILIES WHO

01:07:58.307 --> 01:07:59.241
WANT THIS THE THE THE SLIGHT

01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:01.477
EVEN IF EVEN IF IT'S AVAILABLE

01:08:01.544 --> 01:08:02.845
SO THERE IS SOME KIND OF SET A

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.146
REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT YOU

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:04.380
MIGHT.

01:08:04.447 --> 01:08:06.549
HAVE THAT THAT NOT ALL STUDENTS

01:08:06.615 --> 01:08:08.684
WHO ARE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TEND

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:09.285
FOR EXAMPLE NOT EVERY.

01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:11.420
NOT NOT EVEN EVERY L. G. NOT

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:13.055
EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA TEND

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:14.156
THE PUBLIC KINDERGARTEN FOR

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:15.558
EXAMPLE -- SO YOU HAVE SOME

01:08:15.624 --> 01:08:16.592
SIMILAR EXPECTATIONS IN THE

01:08:16.659 --> 01:08:17.326
PRESCHOOL SIDE SO MY

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:18.961
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE THIRTY

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:20.529
THOUSAND WAS AN ATTEMPT. TO TO

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:22.131
COME UP WITH WHAT INCREASED IS

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:23.966
NECESSARY FOR STATE PRESCHOOL SO

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:25.401
THAT WE WOULD BE AT THE STATE

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:27.436
SERVING ALL LOW INCOME CHILDREN

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:28.938
WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND WHOSE

01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:30.973
FAMILIES ARE INTERESTED IN

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.508
RECEIVING A SLOT GOT IT IN ME

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:32.708
THAT.

01:08:32.775 --> 01:08:34.243
THAT HELPED.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:35.177
IF I MAY ASK ON THE DAILY -- BUT

01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:36.245
THAT HE'S EXACTLY RIGHT SO THE

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:37.413
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.081
TO SERVE ALL LOW INCOME FOUR

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:40.749
YEAR OLDS SO THE THIRTY THOUSAND

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:42.151
WAS JUST AN ESTIMATE OF THOSE

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:43.786
NOT BEING SERVED AT THE TO TRY

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:44.487
TO GET THERE YES.

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:52.127
SO AS I'M CERTAIN WE'RE TRYING

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:53.262
TO IMPROVE OUR OUR DATA

01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:53.863
COLLECTION AS WE ARE AS I'VE

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:54.763
LEARNED ACROSS THE ENTIRE

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:55.698
EDUCATION SPECTRUM.

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:56.565
PERFECT I WAS GONNA SAY THAT WAS%

01:08:56.632 --> 01:08:57.199
THE ACTUALLY HAD ON A PERFECTLY

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:58.067
WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA CHALLENGES

01:08:58.134 --> 01:08:59.335
AROUND AND DUPLICATE ACCOUNTS OF

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:00.169
CHILDREN.

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:01.136
THE UNDERSTANDING WHERE CHILDREN

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:02.271
ARE NOT THEY'RE BEING SERVED BY

01:09:02.338 --> 01:09:02.872
HEAD START FOR SAYS AS STATE

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:04.807
PROGRAM ISN'T SOMETHING THAT

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:06.375
WERE ABLE TO GET TO VERY EASILY

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:08.077
FELT THE LA AHEAD I'M NOT

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:08.777
CORRECTLY.

01:09:08.844 --> 01:09:09.512
AND EARLY WE HAVE DATA

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:11.380
CHALLENGES PRES THROUGH CAREERS

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:13.082
SO I KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIX

FACILITY ISSUES ARE KEY THESE

01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:10.519
ARE THINGS THAT COMMONLY COME UP

CHILDCARE PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS --

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:15.991
OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE STATE

LACKS SOME DATA TO MAKE INFORMED

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:19.194

WORKERS WE DON'T HUNT AND WE

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:30.539
DON'T HAVE INFORMATION ON THE

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:37.279
AS THAT RESEARCH GROUP WILL

01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:39.314

01:13:39.381 --> 01:13:40.749

01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:10.906
WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS SERVING L. --

01:15:10.973 --> 01:15:12.140
ELIGIBLE FAMILIES AND BETTER

01:15:12.207 --> 01:15:13.442
UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF THESE

01:15:13.508 --> 01:15:15.477
FAMILIES I'M IN THE STUDY IS

01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:17.679
THERE'S A STRATEGICALLY DEFINE A

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:19.681
DESIGN AND INCREASED CHILDCARE

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:20.582
PRESCHOOL EXT.

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:21.350
THINK ABOUT HOW CARING SPREE

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:22.751
PRESCHOOL EXPANSION IN A

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:24.586
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NEEDS OF

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:26.388
FAMILIES.

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:27.422
WE RECOGNIZE THAT.

01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:28.824
HAPPENING ADDITIONAL STUDIES IN

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:29.925
GETTING THE INFORMATION TO

01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:31.760
INCLUDED IN A IN A STATE PROGRAM

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:33.996
WOULD TAKE TIME I'M SO THAT THE

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:35.230
DECISIONS OF THE STUDIES --

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:38.667
COULD IN COULD INFORM THE TWENTY

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:39.234
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:15:39.301 --> 01:15:41.470
BUDGET -- THIS CONCLUDES MY

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:42.004
REMARKS BUT HAPPY TO TAKE

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:43.705
QUESTIONS WELL BEFORE WE GO TO

01:15:43.772 --> 01:15:45.874
THE CD JUST TO THROW A COUPLE

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:47.476
THINGS THAT MAYBE YOU COULD

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:50.679
COVER IN YOUR PRESENTATION.

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:51.713
I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IN AND

MAYBE YOU'VE COVERED IT AND I

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.383
JUST.

01:15:54.449 --> 01:15:57.052
MY OLD BRAIN IS SLOW I'M TRYING

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:57.953
TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT

01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:59.755
INFORMATION WE CURRENTLY HAVE

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:00.989

YOU KNOW CHILD CARE AND PRE

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:04.426
SCHOOL FACILITIES AND WORK FORCE.

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:06.128
NUMBER.

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:08.063
ONE A NUMBER TO HAVE A BETTER

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:10.198
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE THE NEW.

01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:12.134
STUDY.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.802
COURSE TO TO STUDIES I GUESS

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:15.637
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:16.338
PROPOSED.

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:18.507
WILL.

01:16:18.573 --> 01:16:20.742
INTERFACE WITH STUDIES THAT

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:22.377
APPARENTLY IN COMMISSION REPORTS

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:23.578
OF CURRENTLY FORTY BEEN

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:25.814
CONDUCTED IN RELEASED OR IN THE

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:26.949
PROCESS WHETHER IT'S THE

OR THIS OTHER WORKGROUP ON RATE

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.690
STRUCTURES OR THE WORKFORCE

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:35.891
STUDY THAT APPARENTLY IS.

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:38.894
GOING TO BE RELEASED IN LATE.

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:40.762
TWENTY TWENTY WE WERE CUSTOM

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:41.363
DOING A LOT OF STUDIES UP HERE

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:42.931
AND SEEING A LOT OF STUDY

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:44.633
PROPOSALS AND THIS IS YET

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:45.801
ANOTHER ONE BUT HOW DO HOW DO WE

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:47.035
GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS AND

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:48.337
FIGURE OUT.

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:49.905
WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE

NEED WHAT WE'VE SEENTHREE OTHER

01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:54.009
TIMES IN DIFFERENT VERSIONS AND

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:56.845
OR WE SIMPLY FOR FUNDING?

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:58.747
ANOTHER STUDY THAT'S NOT REALLY

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:01.316
A QUESTION FOR WHICH I APOLOGIZE

01:17:01.383 --> 01:17:03.151
BUT I WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT.

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:04.419
CITY BEFORE YOU PRESENTED AND

IT'S GOING.

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:20.002
TO A PROVIDE NEW INFORMATION AND

01:17:20.068 --> 01:17:21.036
AND COVERED.

SOME OF THE DATA COLLECTION THAT

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:23.739
THAT WE'RE SHORT REALLY

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.374
STRUGGLING TO GET SO -- THIS

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.010
MASTER PLAN IS IS INTENDED TO

01:17:28.076 --> 01:17:29.611
BUILD OFF ALL OF THESE OTHER

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:32.280
GREAT PLANS WE KNOW THAT CD HAS

01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:34.216
THEIR PRESCHOOL -- DEVELOPMENT

01:17:34.282 --> 01:17:36.618
GRANT -- A NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:37.552
THEY'RE DOING AS WELL AS THE

01:17:37.619 --> 01:17:39.087
ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:40.956
THE THE WORK GROUP ON ON RACE

01:17:41.023 --> 01:17:41.823
THERE BEEN.

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.125
SO MANY GREAT PLANS HAVE BEEN

01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:44.493
OUT THERE AND THIS PARTICULAR

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:47.295
MASTER PLAN IS VERY IS.

01:17:47.362 --> 01:17:48.697
PLANNING ON BUILDING ON TOP OF

01:17:48.764 --> 01:17:50.332
ALL OF THOSE -- THOSE PLANS

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:51.533
PROVIDE A LOT OF GREAT POLICY

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.968
RECOMMENDATIONS THIS MASTER PLAN

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:54.302
ONCE THE LINK THOSE POLICY

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:56.338
RECOMMENDATIONS TO STRATEGIES

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:57.839
AND ONE OF THE REALLY.

01:17:57.906 --> 01:17:59.708
BIG EMPHASES THAT ODD THIS PLAN

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:01.610
IS GOING TO ADDRESS IS ALSO

01:18:01.676 --> 01:18:03.345
LOOKING OUT FUNDING SOURCES SO

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:05.447
IDENTIFYING -- THE FUNDING

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:06.915
SOURCES THAT WOULD REALLY MAKE

01:18:06.982 --> 01:18:08.216
THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM MUCH MORE

01:18:08.283 --> 01:18:09.484
SUSTAINABLE LOOKING AT

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:10.719
ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES

01:18:10.786 --> 01:18:12.354
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS

01:18:12.421 --> 01:18:13.455
REALLY GETTING INTO THE WEEDS

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:15.223
ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY IT WOULD TAKE

01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:17.659
FINANCIALLY. TO TO CREATE THE

01:18:17.726 --> 01:18:21.863
PROGRAMS AND AND THE THE ACCESS.

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:23.465
THAT FAMILIES NEED -- WITHIN

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:25.167
THESE THESE LARGER CHILD CARE

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:26.535
SYSTEM I I GET IT.

01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:28.670
I UNDERSTAND.

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:31.940
GOOD POINTS YES MA'AM.

ALWAYS OKAYFEMINIST I REWORKED

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:36.344
FOR US AS WE DIVE INTO THE WORK

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:38.780
FORCE ISSUE WE KNOW FROM THE

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:40.615
RESEARCH -- ACTUALLY MINUTE BACK

01:18:40.682 --> 01:18:41.349
UP AND JUST AT THE HOW MUCH WE

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:43.452
APPRECIATE THAT IN ADDITION TO

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:44.986
THE STARK ACT -- INVESTMENT IN

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:46.421
ACCESS THAT THESE ARE BEING

01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:47.722
PAIRED WITH MUCH NEEDED

01:18:47.789 --> 01:18:49.758
INVESTMENTS IN EARLY LEARNING

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:51.526
CARE SYSTEM OVER ALSO WORK FOR

01:18:51.593 --> 01:18:52.694
SOME FACILITIES OR THINGS WE

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:53.795
HEAR ABOUT DALY.

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:59.935
pTHE STATE THAT THEY REALLY NEED

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:00.735
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS AND SO

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:01.369
STARTING WITH THE WORK FORCE WE

01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:02.838
KNOW THAT RESEARCH REALLY SHOWS

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:04.573
THE QUALITY AND RESPONSIVENESS

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:06.341
OF CHILD ADULT INTERACTIONS.

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:07.442
IN THE EARLY LEARNING CARE

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:09.711
ENVIRONMENTS -- MAJOR PREDICTOR

01:19:09.778 --> 01:19:11.546
OF CHILD OUTCOMES FOCUSING ON

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:13.048
THOSE ADULTS THOSE ARE ACTUALLY

01:19:13.115 --> 01:19:14.883
PROVIDING THE CARE IS THE MOST

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:17.586
CRITICAL PART OF ANY EXPANSION.

01:19:17.652 --> 01:19:18.820
WITH THAT WE WILL ALWAYS THERE

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:20.255
BEFORE WE DIVE INTO THEIR ACTUAL

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:21.923
PROFESSIONAL LEARNING THE HIGHER

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:23.258
EDUCATION PORTFOLIO THAT THEY

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:25.060
MAY NEED WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:26.495
COMPENSATION.

01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:27.329
AND ENSURING THAT THE WORK

01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:29.598
FORCES ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:31.933
RESEARCH TELLS US THAT 58% OF

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.135
CHILD CARE WORKER FAMILIES

01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:34.536
PARTICIPATE IN ONE OR MORE

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:37.272
PUBLIC INCOME SUPPORT PROGRAMS.

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:38.707
CITIES TEACHERS THEMSELVES MAKE

01:19:38.773 --> 01:19:40.408
A FRACTION OF WHAT KINDERGARTEN

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:42.210
TEACHERS MAKE AND DON'T HAVE THE

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:44.246
DIGITAL RESOURCES TO PAY FOR THE

01:19:44.312 --> 01:19:45.247
COURSE WORKER TRAINING.

01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:46.248
WE APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:19:46.314 --> 01:19:48.016
HAS RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:49.951
IMPROVING QUALITY BY INCREASING

01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:51.419
THE KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCIES

01:19:51.486 --> 01:19:52.821
OF THE WORK FORCE.

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:54.089
WE ALSO APPRECIATE THAT IT IS

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:55.590
PARA AND RECOGNIZE THAT THEY

01:19:55.657 --> 01:19:57.192
WILL NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT IN

01:19:57.259 --> 01:19:59.628
ORDER TO ACCESS THE COURSE WORK

01:19:59.694 --> 01:20:00.929
AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:02.297
AS WE DIVE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:03.665
LESSNS LEARNED OVER THE PAST

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:05.534
SEVERAL YEARS FROM QUALITY

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.069
PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED.

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:08.970
THROUGH BOTH RC CDF OUR

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:09.771
CHILDCARE AND DEVELOPMENT FUND

01:20:09.838 --> 01:20:11.873
QUALITY PROJECTS WE HAVE

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.742
SOMETHING CALLED AB TWO TWELVE

01:20:13.808 --> 01:20:14.376
THERE'S ALSO BEEN SENDING THAT

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:15.944
FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA FUNDED IN

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:18.079
THE PAST CALLED FIRST FIVE CARES.

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:19.147
THROUGH THOSE WORKFORCE EFFORTS

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:20.649
AS WELL AS OUR CURRENT QUALITY

01:20:20.715 --> 01:20:22.651
COUNTS CALIFORNIA QUALITY

01:20:22.717 --> 01:20:24.252
READING IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM WE

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:25.487
HAVE A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:32.360
THAT WE THINK WE ON THE TO KEEP

01:20:32.427 --> 01:20:33.828
IN MIND AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:34.462
SO I WAS STRESSED OVER AND OVER

01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:35.197
THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:35.997
INTENTIONAL ENSURING THEIR

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:36.631
SUPPORT FOR THE WORK FORCE YOU

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:37.432
REALLY NEED TO WRAP AROUND.

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:38.900
THE EDUCATIONAL PROFESSIONAL

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:40.135
LEARNING GOALS THAT THEY SAT TO

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:41.169
ENSURE THAT THEY CAN BE

01:20:41.236 --> 01:20:43.138
SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING THEM.

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:44.573
ONE KEY THING WE FOUND WAS THE

01:20:44.639 --> 01:20:46.408
IMPORTANCE OF ADVISORS A FORMER

01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:47.876
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:49.277
WAS UNIQUE IN THAT REQUIRED

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:50.512
PARTICIPANTS TO MEET WITH AN

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:51.913
ADVISOR TWICE A YEAR.

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:53.315
WHO COULD HELP MAP OUT THEIR

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:55.050
PROFESSIONAL LEARNING JOURNEY

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:55.884
ADVISE THEM WHAT TRAININGS AND

01:20:55.951 --> 01:20:58.320
COURSE WORKS THAT THEY COULD

01:20:58.386 --> 01:20:59.754
TAKE TO HELP THEM ACHIEVE THAT?

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.323
FROM THE RESEARCH ON EVALUATION

01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:02.924
OF THAT PROGRAM THE NUMBER ONE

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:04.526
THING THAT THE PARTICIPANTS THAT

01:21:04.593 --> 01:21:05.927
MADE A DIFFERENCE WAS EIGHT THEY

01:21:05.994 --> 01:21:08.163
FELT VALIDATED AND THEIR

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:09.097
PROFESSION.

01:21:09.164 --> 01:21:09.831
MEETING WITH THAT ADVISER MADE

01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:11.366
THEM FEEL HEARD AND IMPORTANT IN

01:21:11.433 --> 01:21:13.201
THEIR WORK.

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:14.336
SECOND WITH COURSE WORK THAT

01:21:14.402 --> 01:21:15.237
DEVELOPS KNOWLEDGE AND

01:21:15.303 --> 01:21:17.138
COMPETENCIES SO MUCH OF PROGRAM

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:18.707
QUALITY ACTUALLY DEALS WITH

01:21:18.773 --> 01:21:20.508
PERFECTING THAT CHILD ADULT

SUPPORTS THEY GET TRAINING.

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:13.128
A CAT AM TUTORING THAT THAT

THE LICENSE FACILITIES THAT ARE

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:23.091
PART OF THE ISSUE.

01:24:23.158 --> 01:24:24.993
CALIFORNIA HAS ABOUT SIX POINT

01:24:25.059 --> 01:24:26.928
FIVE MILLION CHILDREN AGE BIRTH

01:24:31.966 --> 01:24:33.701
OF THESE CHILDREN WE ESTIMATE

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:35.637
ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION

THAT A FAIR QUESTION.

01:27:21.803 --> 01:27:23.738
A TRENTON ACOSTA.

01:27:23.805 --> 01:27:25.740
A LIFE OF RECOVERY CALLS IS AS

01:27:25.807 --> 01:27:27.375
WELL -- SO -- I THINK THAT THAT

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:28.576
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS A

01:27:28.643 --> 01:27:30.311
PRETTY DECENTRALIZED -- SYSTEM

01:27:30.378 --> 01:27:31.946
AND SO IT BEING DONE VERY

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:34.215
SIGNIFICANTLY FOR US FROM ACROSS

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:36.451
THE STATE -- UNFORTUNATELY THE

01:27:36.517 --> 01:27:37.118
CENTRAL.

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:38.553
AND ALSO EVEN EVEN IN THE

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:39.687
COMMITTEE COLLEGES WE HAVE THE

01:27:39.754 --> 01:27:41.122
STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM WHICH

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:44.158
DOES REQUIRE COLLEGES. TO SERVE

01:27:44.225 --> 01:27:45.927
GET GET TOGETHER IN CONSORTIA

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:47.095
AND AND DEVELOP THEM PLANS

01:27:47.161 --> 01:27:50.231
AROUND SOME OF THESE -- IMPORT

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:51.265
INDUSTRIES.

01:27:51.332 --> 01:27:52.700
THAT I THINK THE HOW MUCH ANY

01:27:52.767 --> 01:27:54.135
SPECIFIC REGION IS GOING TO

01:27:54.202 --> 01:27:55.603
PRIORITIZE EARLY EDUCATION WRIST

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:56.571
VERSUS OTHERS.

01:27:56.638 --> 01:27:58.740
IT IS IS GONNA VERY ACROSS THE

01:27:58.806 --> 01:28:00.308
STATE I WOULD SAY IT IN A MOVE

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:00.808
BY THE WAY THEY SHOULD

01:28:00.875 --> 01:28:02.410
PRIORITIZE IT BASED ON THE

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:03.745
DEMAND IN THE REGION.

01:28:03.811 --> 01:28:05.513
WHICH IS THE DEMAND SIDE OF THE

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:07.281
EQUATION WHICH IS WHAT CONCERNED

01:28:07.348 --> 01:28:09.183
YEAH AND I WOULD SAY THAT I

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:10.018
THINK THE THE STRONG WORK FORCE

01:28:10.084 --> 01:28:12.086
FROM OUR WE HAVE HAD ACT A FEW

01:28:12.153 --> 01:28:12.987
YEARS AGO WE HAD SOME

01:28:13.054 --> 01:28:13.554
CONVERSATION WITH COMMITTEE

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:15.957
CALLED STE -- FOLKS ABOUT THE

01:28:16.024 --> 01:28:17.291
CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OF

01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:18.626
INTO THE COLLEGES ARE

01:28:18.693 --> 01:28:20.695
PRIORITIZING PROGRAMS THAT DO

01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:22.163
ONE OF TWO THINGS ONE IS THERE'S

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:23.364
DEMAND FOR THIS INCREASED NUMBER

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:24.499
OF JOBS.

01:28:24.565 --> 01:28:25.900
IN TO THAT WE CAN EXPECT THAT

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:35.276
THOSE -- INDIVIDUALS WHO.

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:36.511
WHO'D CONDUCT THE TRAINING TO

01:28:36.577 --> 01:28:38.279
GET THOSE JOBS ARE WELL PAID.

01:28:38.346 --> 01:28:39.180
I THINK SOME COMEY COLLEGES ON

01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:40.448
THE DEMAND SIDE OF ITS FOR

01:28:40.515 --> 01:28:41.482
EXPANDING PRESCHOOL THEN THERE

01:28:41.549 --> 01:28:42.316
MIGHT BE -- THE NEED FOR

01:28:42.383 --> 01:28:43.217
ADDITIONAL JOBS BUT COMPARED TO

01:28:43.284 --> 01:28:45.920
OTHER POTENTIAL CD TYPE PROGRAMS --

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:46.988
BEING IN THE EARLY EDUCATION

01:28:47.055 --> 01:28:47.555
WORKFORCE RIGHT NOW IS NOT

01:28:47.622 --> 01:28:49.023
VIEWED AS A VERY HIGH PAYING JOB

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:49.991
AND SO SOME COLLEGES.

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:51.092
ARE PRIORITIZING SOME UP SOME OF

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:52.160
THE OTHER INDUSTRIES -- BECAUSE

01:28:52.226 --> 01:28:52.427
OF THAT.

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:53.127
WHICH RESULTS IN A DISCONNECT

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:55.797
BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:28:55.863 --> 01:28:56.798
PRIORITY. ONE OF THE

01:28:56.864 --> 01:28:57.899
ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIES IN

01:28:57.965 --> 01:28:58.833
OUR PRIORITY HERE IN THE IN THE

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.736
LEGISLATURE IF IT IS A PRIORITY.

01:29:01.803 --> 01:29:03.404
EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION

01:29:03.471 --> 01:29:04.906
DISCONNECT BETWEEN THAT AND

01:29:04.972 --> 01:29:06.941
WHAT'S GOING TO GOING ON DOWN IN

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:08.543
THE REGION'S WITH RESPECT TO

01:29:08.609 --> 01:29:09.944
EDUCATING AND PREPARING THE

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.579
WORKFORCE TO MEET.

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:13.481
A REQUIREMENTS WHICH PROBABLY

01:29:13.548 --> 01:29:15.950
PROBABLY NEED TO WORK ON THAT.

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:17.652
COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS.

YOU BELIEVE IN -- ADVANCING OUR

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:12.907
FUTURE SO THERE IS A DISCONNECT

I'M SURE IT'S QUITE TRUE BUT I

01:30:33.594 --> 01:30:35.630
JUST HADN'T HEARD THAT.

01:30:35.696 --> 01:30:36.764
WE ARE ACTUALLY ANALYZING OUR

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:37.899
DATA RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE A

01:30:37.965 --> 01:30:40.234
NUMBER I THINK ABOUT FOUR

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:41.202
HUNDRED AND STATE CODES THAT

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:42.603
DON'T HAVE ANY LICENSED KAREN

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:43.070
NONE.

01:30:43.137 --> 01:30:45.173
AND YET THE FAMILIES ARE SEEKING

01:30:45.239 --> 01:30:47.008

ACCESS TO ROGERS THEY'RE LOOKING

01:30:48.509 --> 01:30:49.343
FOR CARE.

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:51.345
THERE'S QUITE A NUMBER WE TEND

01:30:51.412 --> 01:30:54.081
TO SEE IT MORE IN RURAL ISOLATED

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:55.750
COMMUNITIES.

01:30:55.817 --> 01:30:57.885
AM SO IF YOU LOOK IN LINDA NOT

01:30:57.952 --> 01:30:58.719
NORTH ATTENDS TO HAPPEN A LITTLE

01:30:58.786 --> 01:30:59.387
BIT MORE.

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:00.188
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

01:31:00.254 --> 01:31:01.989
WANT TO DIVE INTO MORE AND MORE

01:31:02.056 --> 01:31:03.491
HAPPY TO SHARE AS WE SERVE

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:05.359

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:13.434
PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW HERE WE

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:14.101
ARE.

01:31:14.168 --> 01:31:16.971
EXPANDING SLOTS WITH BIG PLANS

01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:18.706
TO MOVE AHEAD IN THE FUTURE.

01:31:18.773 --> 01:31:20.575
AND THAT'S GONNA TAKE.

01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:22.176

AND SO I GUESS THERE'S A

01:31:25.479 --> 01:31:28.049
QUESTION ABOUT -- ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:31:28.115 --> 01:31:28.850
THE EXTENT TO WHICH WERE YOU

01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:32.019

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:32.620
WE'RE WITH THEM IN A LOT OF

01:31:32.687 --> 01:31:33.788
COMMITTEE COLLEGES THAT ARE OUT

01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:34.388
THERE ACTUALLY HAVE EXCELLENT

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:37.024
PROGRAMS -- YOU KNOW KIND OF

01:31:37.091 --> 01:31:37.892
MAKES YOU WONDER YOU WERE

01:31:37.959 --> 01:31:38.726
TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:40.261
OF B. A.'S I UNDERSTAND THERE'S

01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:42.096
LIKE A SENSE THAT HAVING A BA

01:31:42.163 --> 01:31:44.232
PROVIDES FOR HIGHER QUALITY.

01:31:44.298 --> 01:31:45.766
TRAINING -- AND AND TEACHING

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:47.235
THOUGH AS YOU SAY IF SOME OF THE

01:31:47.301 --> 01:31:49.470
CURRICULUM SO FAR AWAY FROM THE

01:31:49.537 --> 01:31:50.404
CORE.

01:31:50.471 --> 01:31:52.440
SKILLS THAT THEY NEED FOR THE

01:31:52.506 --> 01:31:53.241
ACTUAL WORK.

01:31:53.307 --> 01:31:54.642
IT MAKES YOU WHERE WONDER ABOUT

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:55.910
THE RELEVANCE RIGHT I MEAN IT

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:57.411
YOU KNOW IS IS.

01:31:57.478 --> 01:31:58.679
IS IT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING

01:31:58.746 --> 01:31:59.881
EXTRA SPECIAL ABOUT THIS TWO X.

01:31:59.947 --> 01:32:01.015
TWO YEARS IN COLLEGE THAT THEY

01:32:01.082 --> 01:32:03.017
CAN'T PICK UP INTO EXTRA YEARS

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:05.887
ON THE JOB -- AS  AS A AS A

01:32:05.953 --> 01:32:07.355
EARLY CHILDHOOD AND INSTRUCTOR

01:32:07.421 --> 01:32:08.689
YOU KNOW I I KNOW WE'RE ALL

01:32:08.756 --> 01:32:10.157
GOING TO VERY WRAPPED UP IN THE

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:11.459
IMPORTANCE OF A BACHELOR'S

01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:13.194
DEGREE BUT I WONDER ON

01:32:13.261 --> 01:32:14.729
PARTICULAR GIPSON HAS YOU SAY

01:32:14.795 --> 01:32:15.196
THE GENERAL EDUCATION

01:32:15.263 --> 01:32:16.564
REQUIREMENTS ARE KIND OF LITTLE

01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:17.765
OFF.

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:19.500
FROM THE FROM THE FROM THAT THE

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:21.168
NEEDS OF THE TEACHERS.

01:32:21.235 --> 01:32:22.737
I WONDER HOW WHETHER WE'RE WE'RE

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:25.339
LETTING -- FORM TROUBLED TRUMP

01:32:25.406 --> 01:32:27.308
FUNCTION.

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:27.875
SO I WOULD SAY ACTUALLY WAS

01:32:27.942 --> 01:32:29.543
SPEAKING SPEAKING ACROSS THE

01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:31.145
SPECTRUM FELLOW AS WE HAVE

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:32.380

HAVE BANNED IN SOME OF OUR

01:32:35.316 --> 01:32:36.884
TRAINING AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS IN

01:32:36.951 --> 01:32:38.586
THE PAST BECAUSE IF.

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:40.388
YOU SHARED THAT THEY WANT TO DO

01:32:40.454 --> 01:32:42.290
THAT BASS THEY WANT TO BE THE

01:32:42.356 --> 01:32:44.392
BEST THAT THEY CAN BE TO SUPPORT

01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:45.760
THESE CHILDREN TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

01:32:45.826 --> 01:32:48.729
PHIL WE'VE SEEN THAT -- NOT JUST

01:32:48.796 --> 01:32:50.164
AT THE BE A LEVEL BUT THE A

01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:52.300
LEVEL TWO YOU BUMP INTO THOSE

01:32:52.366 --> 01:32:53.935
REQUIREMENTS AROUND GENERAL AD

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:55.136
AND THE PROVIDERS TEND TO

01:32:55.202 --> 01:32:56.804
STRUGGLE A LITTLE BIT MORE WITH.

01:32:56.871 --> 01:32:58.539
THE ENGLISH AND ESPECIALLY THE

01:32:58.606 --> 01:33:00.241
MATH COURSES THROUGH ITS ACROSS

01:33:00.308 --> 01:33:01.709
ALL OF THEM AND SOME OF THE

01:33:01.776 --> 01:33:03.611
ACCESS POINTS IF YOU'RE WORKING

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:04.745
ALL DAY AND SOME OF OUR

01:33:04.812 --> 01:33:06.247
PROVIDERS WORK.

01:33:06.314 --> 01:33:07.915
INTO THE EVENING IT CAN BE

01:33:07.982 --> 01:33:09.483
REALLY HARD TO ACCESSING SO EVEN

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:11.152
IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE YOUR

01:33:11.218 --> 01:33:12.753
KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS THAT.

01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:14.789
IT'S TRYING TO MAKE THOSE A

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:16.223
LITTLE BIT MORE AVAILABLE

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:18.125
WHETHER THEY BE WEB BASED

01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:19.060
WHETHER THEY HAVE THEM IN THE

01:33:19.126 --> 01:33:20.494
WEEKENDS ARE RATHER THEY HAVE

01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:22.196
EVENING ACCESS TO SOMETHING.

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:23.397
BUT THEN HOW DO YOU PROVIDE

01:33:23.464 --> 01:33:24.899
SUPPORT FOR THEM SO THEY DON'T

01:33:24.966 --> 01:33:27.335
FEEL SORT OF OFF ON THEIR OWN IN

01:33:27.401 --> 01:33:28.602
FRONT OF A COMPUTER THAT THEY

01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:30.171
MAY NOT BE SKILLED AT AND SO IT

01:33:30.237 --> 01:33:31.572
REALLY IS PAIRING THEM TOGETHER

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:32.807
WITH AN ADVISER.

01:33:32.873 --> 01:33:34.008
THOSE CORE HURTS WORKED

01:33:34.075 --> 01:33:35.543
FABULOUSLY WE DID HAVE FAMILY

01:33:35.609 --> 01:33:36.277
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND CO

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:38.379
HURTS IN THE YEARS PAST WHO DID

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:39.213
WANT TO GO AND GET THEIR

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:39.780
BACHELORS.

01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:41.816
AND I MEAN I WOULD NEVER WANT TO

01:33:41.882 --> 01:33:43.617
SAY TO A WOMAN A WOMAN OF COLOR

01:33:43.684 --> 01:33:44.919
THAT THEY CAN'T ACHIEVE THAT

01:33:44.986 --> 01:33:45.853
BACHELOR'S IF THAT'S WHAT THEY

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:46.921
WANT.

01:33:46.988 --> 01:33:48.723
THE WE SAW SUCCESS ACROSS ALL OF

01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:49.957
IT THE KID CAN CAN AGREE WITH

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:51.659
THAT MORE BUT BUT I BUT I GUESS

PUSHING OUT THERE.

01:35:16.944 --> 01:35:18.145
AND I I LOVE THE I DON'T KNOW IS

01:35:18.212 --> 01:35:19.113
THERE IS THERE BEEN A

01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:19.947
CONVERSATION WITH THE TO ME

01:35:20.014 --> 01:35:21.515
COLLEGES ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS

01:35:21.582 --> 01:35:22.883
AND HOW TO GET FUNDING TO THEM

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:23.751
FOR THIS AND HOW TO REALLY.

01:35:23.818 --> 01:35:27.021
BE ABLE.

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:27.822
TO YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I WORRY

01:35:27.888 --> 01:35:29.090
I'M I'M WORKING RIGHT NOW ON A

01:35:29.156 --> 01:35:31.592
COORDINATING A COUPLE COURTING

01:35:31.659 --> 01:35:33.160
BILLS RIGHT YOU KNOW.

01:35:33.227 --> 01:35:34.228
SO AS WE WE DO GREAT STUFF IN

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:35.563
ONE PORTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:37.098
SYSTEM AND THAT AND THAT CREATES

01:35:37.164 --> 01:35:38.866
A WHOLE NEW SET OF OPPORTUNITIES

01:35:38.933 --> 01:35:40.601
AND RESPONSIBILITIES ON OTHER

01:35:40.668 --> 01:35:43.070
PARTY EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OUT WE

01:35:43.137 --> 01:35:43.704
MAKE SURE THAT THE LEFT IN STOCK

01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:46.307
IN THE RIGHT HAND.

01:35:46.373 --> 01:35:47.575
I THINK IT JUST FROM PAST

01:35:47.641 --> 01:35:48.609
EXPERIENCE WITH OUR PROGRAMS

01:35:48.676 --> 01:35:49.610
THEY TYPICALLY HAVE PARTNERED

01:35:49.677 --> 01:35:51.178
VERY CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITY

01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:52.646
COLLEGES IT'S CREAM THAT ACCESS

01:35:52.713 --> 01:35:53.714
POINT SAID THAT.

01:35:53.781 --> 01:35:55.883
THE PROVIDERS DON'T ALWAYS HAVE

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:57.284
TO GO ON TO THE COLLEGE CAMPUS

01:35:57.351 --> 01:35:59.053
TO ACCESS THE COURSES AND THAT'S

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.121
WHY SOME OF THE PRODUCES

01:36:00.187 --> 01:36:01.956
PROGRAMS HAVE BROUGHT THEM ON TO

01:36:02.022 --> 01:36:03.257
THE CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:04.125
CENTER SITE.

01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:05.226
AND THEY BROUGHT IN FAMILY

01:36:05.292 --> 01:36:06.327
TUCKER PROVIDERS FROM THE

01:36:06.393 --> 01:36:07.394
COMMUNITY DO COULD BE PAIRED

01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:09.463
WITH CENTER STAFF AS THEY GO

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:11.332
THROUGH ARTICULATED COURSE WORK

01:36:11.398 --> 01:36:12.933
THAT'S BEING TAUGHT THROUGH A

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.201
COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR ANOTHER

01:36:14.268 --> 01:36:15.436
COLLEGE SYSTEM.

01:36:15.503 --> 01:36:17.171
THROUGH ITS JUST INSURING AS YOU

01:36:17.238 --> 01:36:18.539
LOOK AT LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:19.874
YOU THOUGHT THROUGH WHO IS THE

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.976
WORK FORCE HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT

01:36:22.042 --> 01:36:23.210
ACCESS AND SUPPORTS ARE THERE.

01:36:23.277 --> 01:36:24.478
SO THEY CAN BE EFFECTIVE AS THEY

01:36:24.545 --> 01:36:26.280
GO THROUGH THE COURSES AND I DO

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:28.182
THINK CONTINUING TO UPDATE WHAT

01:36:28.249 --> 01:36:29.817
THOSE COURSES REFLECT AND

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:31.619
ENSURING THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT

01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:32.887
OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE HERE TODAY.

01:36:32.953 --> 01:36:34.755
SO THAT WE REALLY HAVE A WORK

01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:36.090
FORCE WHO KNOWS HOW TO SUPPORT

01:36:36.157 --> 01:36:38.526
BILINGUALISM AND THEY'RE LOOKING

01:36:38.592 --> 01:36:39.827
AT A CHILD SOME LANGUAGE IN

01:36:39.894 --> 01:36:40.327
ANOTHER.

01:36:40.394 --> 01:36:41.462
AND AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:43.631
CLASSES THAT I THINK THAT WE'VE

01:36:43.697 --> 01:36:44.798
SEEN IN PAST WORK FOR STUDIES

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:46.400
WARRANT IS AVAILABLE AND SO

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:47.801
MAKING MORE AND MORE IF THAT.

01:36:47.868 --> 01:36:50.271
CONTENT KNOWLEDGE AVAILABLE

01:36:50.337 --> 01:36:54.875
GERMAN FOREIGN CARE IN THAT

01:36:54.942 --> 01:36:56.177
PIECE.

01:36:56.243 --> 01:36:57.745
EMBEDDING DOT AS SOMETHING THAT

01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:58.646
ALL OF OUR PROVIDERS SCOTT AS

01:36:58.712 --> 01:36:59.480
THEY MOVE FORWARD.

01:36:59.547 --> 01:36:59.980
WOULD REALLY SUPPORT OUR

01:37:00.047 --> 01:37:01.348
CHILDREN.

01:37:01.415 --> 01:37:01.715
WELL.

01:37:01.782 --> 01:37:03.651
I'LL MAKE THIS OBSERVATION --

01:37:03.717 --> 01:37:04.952
AND I'VE.

01:37:05.019 --> 01:37:06.086
WE DID A SELECT COMMITTEE

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:07.555
HEARING ON SOME OF THIS DOWN IN

01:37:07.621 --> 01:37:09.657
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I'VE

01:37:09.723 --> 01:37:11.325
TALKED TO SOME FOLKS IN AND A

01:37:11.392 --> 01:37:12.793
GENERALIZATION WE GENERALLY

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:14.061
LEAVE IT TO THE EDUCATION

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:15.763
COMMUNITY.

01:37:15.829 --> 01:37:18.065
K. THROUGH TWELVE AND ABOVE.

01:37:18.132 --> 01:37:19.733
TO BOTH DESIGN PROVIDE THE

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:22.269
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS BUT ALSO TO

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:23.337
IDENTIFY [inaudible]

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:25.839
THE NEED.

01:37:25.906 --> 01:37:27.208
ANECDOTALLY IT WORKS IN

01:37:27.274 --> 01:37:28.809
DIFFERENT WAYS SOMETIMES THAT'S

01:37:28.876 --> 01:37:30.411
NOT THE CASE BUT GENERALLY WE

01:37:30.477 --> 01:37:31.512
RELY ON THE EDUCATIONAL

01:37:31.579 --> 01:37:34.815
COMMUNITY. TO IDENTIFY THE NEED

01:37:34.882 --> 01:37:36.550
AND THEN BY THE EDUCATIONAL

01:37:36.617 --> 01:37:38.352
COMPONENT AND I AM NOT SURE

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:39.720
THAT'S THE BEST AND MOST

01:37:39.787 --> 01:37:41.355
ORGANIZED EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:42.423
WAY TO DO IT.

01:37:42.489 --> 01:37:44.058
SO I'M GIVING KUDOS THE

01:37:44.124 --> 01:37:45.593
EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR

01:37:45.659 --> 01:37:48.062
STEPPING OUTSIDE THE SANDBOX AND

01:37:48.128 --> 01:37:49.697
DOING THINGS THAT I THINK OTHER.

01:37:49.763 --> 01:37:51.198
ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD BE

01:37:51.265 --> 01:37:52.566
ORGANIZED TO DO WHICH IS

01:37:52.633 --> 01:37:54.735
IDENTIFY WITH THE JOB NEED IS IN

01:37:54.802 --> 01:37:56.203
THIS CASE CHILD CARE.

01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:58.372
EDUCATION WORKERS AND THEN WORK

01:37:58.439 --> 01:38:00.107
WITH THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY

01:38:00.174 --> 01:38:02.176
TO PROVIDE THE TRAINING -- AND

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:03.944
THE CERTIFICATES OF DEGREES

01:38:04.011 --> 01:38:05.846
WHATEVER THEY ARE WHATEVER LEVEL.

01:38:05.913 --> 01:38:06.947
TO TO MEET THE NEEDS THAT I

01:38:07.014 --> 01:38:08.015
THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:09.550
IT IN A MORE ORGANIZED.

01:38:09.617 --> 01:38:10.784
AND EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE WAY

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:13.254
STARTING STATE DOWN NOT TO TAKE

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:15.789
AWAY LOCAL CONTROL FOR THE LOCAL.

01:38:15.856 --> 01:38:17.524
REGIONAL CONSORTIA OR WHATEVER

01:38:17.591 --> 01:38:19.293
THE ORGANIZATIONAL ENTITY IS

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.661
THAT IS TASKED WITH THIS

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:22.162
RESPONSIBILITY WOULD DETERMINE

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:23.664
THE NEED IN THE REGION IN SOME

01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:25.966
REGIONS MIGHT HAVE A HIGH NEED.

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:29.036
FOR OF EDUCATION WORKERS.

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:30.671
OTHER REGIONS MAY NOT HAVE QUITE

01:38:30.738 --> 01:38:32.773
AS MUCH IN THE BUT THIS IS NOT

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.475
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS AND

01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:36.610
I'M JUST GIVING A LECTURE RIGHT

01:38:36.677 --> 01:38:37.244
NOW BUT I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW

01:38:37.311 --> 01:38:39.346
WHAT MY PERSPECTIVE IS AND THE

01:38:39.413 --> 01:38:41.482
GOOD NEWS IS.

01:38:41.548 --> 01:38:42.082
WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO FUND A

01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:43.250
STUDY.

01:38:43.317 --> 01:38:45.452
YET ANOTHER. ONE TO BUILD ON THE

01:38:45.519 --> 01:38:46.553
OTHER STUDIES THAT WE'VE HAD WE

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:47.888
HAVE AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS

01:38:47.955 --> 01:38:49.657
STUDY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:38:49.723 --> 01:38:51.992
THIS STUDY CAN DO IS AT LEAST

01:38:52.059 --> 01:38:53.260
DETERMINE IN THIS.

01:38:53.327 --> 01:38:55.162
AREA WHETHER THAT WE CAN HAVE A

THE DISCONNECT IS IS THAT WE

01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:34.301

SUBSTANTIAL AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY.

01:42:28.742 --> 01:42:29.843
HOWEVER NEWER DEBTOR SHIP DATA

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:32.479

01:54:33.366 --> 01:54:37.337
I'M SORT OF DISAPPOINTED THAT --

01:54:37.403 --> 01:54:40.807
I DON'T SEE ANY CENTRAL VALLEY --

01:54:40.873 --> 01:54:44.010
INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA --

01:54:44.077 --> 01:54:46.646
CITIES ON THE LIST -- OBVIOUSLY

01:54:46.713 --> 01:54:49.782
DIDN'T HAVE PROGRAMS BY DECEMBER

01:54:49.849 --> 01:54:50.416
THIRTY ONE OF WHATEVER THE YEAR

01:54:50.483 --> 01:54:54.454
WAS BUT IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE --

01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:56.122
HISTORICALLY HAD LOW.

01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:57.523
OF HIGH SCHOOL COMPLETION

01:54:57.590 --> 01:54:59.859
GRADUATION RATES -- LOW COLLEGE

01:54:59.926 --> 01:55:01.928
GOING RATE FOR A WHOLE VARIETY

01:55:01.995 --> 01:55:04.230
OF REASONS. FOR THOSE WHO ARE

01:55:04.297 --> 01:55:05.965
LISTENING DOWN IN THE CENTRAL

01:55:06.032 --> 01:55:06.899
VALLEY AND WHERE I COME FROM IN

01:55:06.966 --> 01:55:08.701
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I HOPE

01:55:08.768 --> 01:55:12.038
THEY STEP IT UP A NOTCH AND SEE

01:55:12.105 --> 01:55:14.807
IF WE CAN PUT PROGRAMS TOGETHER --

01:55:14.874 --> 01:55:15.808
TO QUALIFY FOR SOME OF THIS

01:55:15.875 --> 01:55:18.911
MONEY.

01:55:18.978 --> 01:55:20.246
AND I I THINK I WOULD JUST KNOW

01:55:20.313 --> 01:55:21.447
THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I

01:55:21.514 --> 01:55:23.683
THINK AS WE DELIBERATE ON THE

01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:25.418
PROPOSALS AND THE EXACT FORM

01:55:25.485 --> 01:55:27.887
IT'S GONNA TAKE IS THIS ISSUE OF

01:55:27.954 --> 01:55:28.955
STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN

01:55:29.022 --> 01:55:30.590
PROVIDING FUNDS TO JUMPSTART

01:55:30.657 --> 01:55:31.557
PROGRAMS MAYBE IN AREAS WHERE

01:55:31.624 --> 01:55:32.725
THEY DON'T EXIST.

01:55:32.792 --> 01:55:33.993
BUT BALANCING THAT AGAINST

01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:35.128
WHETHER THAT'S SUSTAINABLE OR

01:55:35.194 --> 01:55:36.896
NOT OR IF THERE IS GOING TO BE

01:55:36.963 --> 01:55:38.197
SOME TYPE OF LOCAL MATCH.

01:55:38.264 --> 01:55:39.899
I'M NOT AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING

01:55:39.966 --> 01:55:41.968
THAT THIS BE USED TO JUMP START

01:55:42.035 --> 01:55:44.003
PROGRAMS I'M SUGGESTING THAT.

01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:45.204
PEOPLE IN AREAS WHERE WE'VE BEEN

01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:48.341

OWN PROGRAM SO THAT THEY CAN

01:55:55.948 --> 01:55:58.151
QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT

01:55:58.217 --> 01:55:59.719
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN A

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:01.721
GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO INCLUDE IN

01:56:02.989 --> 01:56:05.391

01:58:55.461 --> 01:58:56.729
CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES --

01:58:56.796 --> 01:58:59.031
AND SO THIS FUNDING IS REALLY TO

01:58:59.098 --> 01:59:00.600
HAVE TARGETED INCREASE

01:59:00.666 --> 01:59:01.767
INVESTMENTS TO MORE

01:59:01.834 --> 01:59:03.002
REALISTICALLY SUPPORT STUDENTS

01:59:03.069 --> 01:59:04.704
WITH DISABILITIES ESPECIALLY

01:59:04.770 --> 01:59:07.306
STUDENTS IN HIGH NEED AREAS --

01:59:07.373 --> 01:59:08.608
AND TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR

01:59:08.674 --> 01:59:09.876
THESE A STUDENTS AND BONTA BOOK

01:59:09.942 --> 01:59:15.781
COMMUNITIES AND I'D BE HAPPY TO

01:59:15.848 --> 01:59:16.883
TAKE QUESTIONS [inaudible]

01:59:16.949 --> 01:59:19.018
HELLO.

01:59:19.085 --> 01:59:20.386
YEAH -- SO THE ADMINISTRATION

01:59:20.453 --> 01:59:21.287
JUST LAID OUT THERE PROPOSAL AND

01:59:21.354 --> 01:59:22.522
I WILL GET TO THAT AND OUR

01:59:22.588 --> 01:59:23.389
COMMENTS ON IT BUT FIRST I WAS

01:59:23.456 --> 01:59:24.657
ASKED TO OFFER SOME.

01:59:24.724 --> 01:59:27.159
HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF CURRENT

01:59:27.226 --> 01:59:29.228
ISSUES IN SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:59:29.295 --> 01:59:30.763
FINANCE AND I'LL BE DOING SO.

01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:33.065
IN THE HANDOUT THAT THE SERGEANT

01:59:33.132 --> 01:59:34.066
JUST DISTRIBUTED.

01:59:34.133 --> 01:59:36.035
THE FIRST PAGE OF THAT HAND OUT

01:59:36.102 --> 01:59:38.371
AS JUST A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO

01:59:38.437 --> 01:59:39.405
THE CONCEPT TO SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:59:39.472 --> 01:59:41.541
SO.

01:59:41.607 --> 01:59:43.743
REAL QUICKLY SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:59:43.809 --> 01:59:45.444
INSTRUCTION DESIGNED TO MEET THE

01:59:45.511 --> 01:59:46.979
UNIQUE NEEDS OF EACH CHILD WITH

01:59:47.046 --> 01:59:48.381
A DISABILITY FEDERAL LAW

01:59:48.447 --> 01:59:50.483
REQUIRES THAT ALL SCHOOL ALL

01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:51.784
PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

01:59:51.851 --> 01:59:54.754
IDENTIFIED ALL CHILDREN WITH

01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:55.888
DISABILITIES THAT AFFECT THEIR

01:59:55.955 --> 01:59:57.690
LEARNING AND ALONG WITH THEIR

01:59:57.757 --> 01:59:58.958
PARENTS DEVELOP AN

01:59:59.025 --> 02:00:00.893
INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAM

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.361
SPELLING OUT THE SPECIFIC

02:00:02.428 --> 02:00:04.030
SERVICES EACH OF THOSE CHILDREN

02:00:04.096 --> 02:00:05.197
WILL RECEIVE.

02:00:05.264 --> 02:00:07.133
THE FIRST PAGE OF OUR HAND OUT

02:00:07.199 --> 02:00:08.968
WE LAY OUT THE MOST COMMON

02:00:09.035 --> 02:00:11.637
DISABILITIES BY GRAY THE OLD

02:00:11.704 --> 02:00:13.005
NOTICE FIRST OF ALL.

02:00:13.072 --> 02:00:14.941
ABOUT 60% OF ALL CHILDREN WHO

02:00:15.007 --> 02:00:16.175
ARE IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL

02:00:16.242 --> 02:00:17.343
EDUCATION.

02:00:17.410 --> 02:00:21.147
OF ONE OF TWO I USUALLY MILD.

02:00:21.213 --> 02:00:22.582
DISABILITIES.

02:00:22.648 --> 02:00:24.350
IN THE EARLIER GRADES THAT'S

02:00:24.417 --> 02:00:25.818
LARGELY SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS

02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:27.486
SEARCHES STUTTERING ARE

02:00:27.553 --> 02:00:30.556
ARTICULATION DISORDERS.

02:00:30.623 --> 02:00:31.724
AND THE LATER GRADES IT'S

02:00:31.791 --> 02:00:34.193
COMMONLY LEARNING DISORDERS SUCH

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:35.861
AS DYSLEXIA.

02:00:35.928 --> 02:00:37.363
THE SECOND PAGE OF THE HANDOUT

02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:40.266
LAYS OUT SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES

02:00:40.333 --> 02:00:41.667
FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE.

02:00:41.734 --> 02:00:43.336
OF THE TWO BASIC IDEAS HERE

02:00:43.402 --> 02:00:45.104
FIRST.

02:00:45.171 --> 02:00:46.439
CHILDREN WHO ARE RECEIVING

02:00:46.505 --> 02:00:47.673
SPECIAL EDUCATION OR GENERAL

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:49.542
EDUCATION STUDENTS FIRST THEY

02:00:49.609 --> 02:00:50.676
RECEIVE.

02:00:50.743 --> 02:00:53.079
INSTRUCTION THE SAME CURRICULUM.

02:00:53.145 --> 02:00:55.081
OFTEN FROM THE SAME TEACHERS IN

02:00:55.147 --> 02:00:56.549
THE SAME CLASSROOMS AS THEIR

02:00:56.616 --> 02:00:57.416
PEERS WHO DO NOT HAVE

02:00:57.483 --> 02:00:59.018
DISABILITIES AND THEY GENERATE

02:00:59.085 --> 02:01:00.886
THE SAME FUNDING LARGELY THROUGH

02:01:00.953 --> 02:01:01.420
THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

02:01:01.487 --> 02:01:03.356
FORMULA. TO SUPPORT THOSE

02:01:03.422 --> 02:01:05.391
ACTIVITIES SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:01:05.458 --> 02:01:07.526
SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS WERE

02:01:07.593 --> 02:01:08.928
JUST TALKING ABOUT THE

02:01:08.995 --> 02:01:10.630
ADDITIONAL COSTS INCURRED ABOVE

02:01:10.696 --> 02:01:11.897
AND BEYOND THOSE GENERAL

02:01:11.964 --> 02:01:13.399
EDUCATION EXPENDITURES.

02:01:13.466 --> 02:01:15.735
BECAUSE OF THOSE CHILDREN'S I

02:01:15.801 --> 02:01:17.503
HE'S.

02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:18.804
WELL THE FIGURE ON PAGE TWO

02:01:18.871 --> 02:01:20.706
PLAYS OUT THE MOST RECENT DATA

02:01:20.773 --> 02:01:23.809
WE HAVE WHICH IS FROM TWO

02:01:23.876 --> 02:01:24.410
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ON

02:01:24.477 --> 02:01:26.278
THOSE BECAUSE YOU'LL NOTE THAT.

02:01:26.345 --> 02:01:28.914
CURRENTLY IT COSTS ABOUT THREE

02:01:28.981 --> 02:01:30.516
TIMES AS MUCH ON AVERAGE TO

02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:31.484
EDUCATE A STUDENT WITH

02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:32.685
DISABILITIES.

02:01:32.752 --> 02:01:34.720
AS A STERN WHO DOES NOT HAVE

02:01:34.787 --> 02:01:36.622
DISABILITIES OF COURSE THIS

02:01:36.689 --> 02:01:38.224
VARIES A LOT BASED ON THE

02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:41.560
INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF EACH STUDENT.

02:01:41.627 --> 02:01:43.195
PAGE THREE TRACKS HOW THESE

02:01:43.262 --> 02:01:45.564
COSTS HAVE BEEN CHANGING OVER

02:01:45.631 --> 02:01:47.333
THE LAST TEN YEARS.

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.101
RATE THAT IT PRINTED IN A WAY

02:01:49.168 --> 02:01:50.636
THAT IT'S IT'S HARD TO SEE

02:01:50.703 --> 02:01:51.637
EXACTLY WHERE THIS LINE AND

02:01:51.704 --> 02:01:53.072
SPREAD.

02:01:53.139 --> 02:01:55.041
IN INFLATION ADJUSTED TERMS

02:01:55.107 --> 02:01:56.542
TOTAL SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:01:56.609 --> 02:01:58.110
EXPENDITURES HAVE INCREASED BY A

02:01:58.177 --> 02:02:00.413
COUPLE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THIS

02:02:00.479 --> 02:02:01.981
PERIOD.

02:02:02.048 --> 02:02:04.717
THAT INCREASES BEEN BORN LARGELY

02:02:04.784 --> 02:02:06.852
BY THE LOCAL GENERAL PURPOSE

02:02:06.919 --> 02:02:08.054
SHARES SO.

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:10.690
THE THAT WOULD BE THE SHARE OF

02:02:10.756 --> 02:02:12.458
THESE ACCESS SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:02:12.525 --> 02:02:14.593
COSTS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY

02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:15.594
STATE AND FEDERAL CATEGORICAL

02:02:15.661 --> 02:02:17.129
FUNDS.

02:02:17.196 --> 02:02:19.965
AND NOW THIS SHARE THE LOCAL

02:02:20.032 --> 02:02:21.834
SHARE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:02:21.901 --> 02:02:23.369
CLASSES INCREASE FROM.

02:02:23.436 --> 02:02:27.339
WILL LESSEN 50% IN TWO THOUSAND

02:02:27.406 --> 02:02:28.107
SEVEN EIGHT TWO WILL MORE THAN

02:02:28.174 --> 02:02:31.577
60% IN.

02:02:31.644 --> 02:02:32.211
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

02:02:32.278 --> 02:02:33.646
THERE ARE NUMBER OF REASONS WHY

02:02:33.713 --> 02:02:35.715
COSTS HAVE BEEN INCREASING BUT

02:02:35.781 --> 02:02:37.950
AMONG THE LARGER OURS SPILLOVER

02:02:38.017 --> 02:02:40.152
EFFECTS FROM GENERAL EDUCATION

02:02:40.219 --> 02:02:41.987
COSTS.

02:02:42.054 --> 02:02:44.657
AS TEACHERS RECEIVE NEGOTIATED

02:02:44.724 --> 02:02:47.026
SALARY AND OTHER COMPENSATION

02:02:47.093 --> 02:02:49.595
INCREASES THESE APPLY TO SPECIAL

02:02:49.662 --> 02:02:50.930
EDUCATORS WHILE.

02:02:50.996 --> 02:02:53.199
ALSO AS PENSION CONTRIBUTION

02:02:53.265 --> 02:02:54.500
RATES HAVE INCREASED OF THOSE

02:02:54.567 --> 02:02:56.402
HAVE FACTORED SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:02:56.469 --> 02:02:58.404
BECAUSE WE THINK THAT ACCOUNTS

02:02:58.471 --> 02:03:00.206
FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE

02:03:00.272 --> 02:03:01.507
INCREASE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:03:01.574 --> 02:03:03.909
EXPENDITURES OVER THE LAST

02:03:03.976 --> 02:03:04.443
DECADE.

02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:05.611
OF THE REST WE BELIEVE IS

02:03:05.678 --> 02:03:08.080
LARGELY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN

02:03:08.147 --> 02:03:08.948
THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS

02:03:09.014 --> 02:03:11.150
IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:03:11.217 --> 02:03:13.152
IN PARTICULAR AT THAT INCREASES

02:03:13.219 --> 02:03:15.755
BEING DRIVEN BY TWO POPULATIONS.

02:03:15.821 --> 02:03:17.456
OF FIRST THE POPULATION OF

02:03:17.523 --> 02:03:19.391
STUDENTS IDENTIFIED WITH AUTISM

02:03:19.458 --> 02:03:22.428
HAS BEEN INCREASING RATHER

02:03:22.495 --> 02:03:23.429
NOTABLY OVER THIS PERIOD.

02:03:23.496 --> 02:03:25.164
AND SECOND THE POPULATION OF

02:03:25.231 --> 02:03:26.365
CHILDREN IDENTIFIED WITH

02:03:26.432 --> 02:03:28.667
DISABILITIES AGES THREE AND FOUR

02:03:28.734 --> 02:03:30.436
HAS IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANTLY

02:03:30.503 --> 02:03:32.138
OVER THIS PERIOD.

02:03:32.204 --> 02:03:34.373
AND THE FOURTH PAGE OF THIS

02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.342
HANDOUT SPEAKS SPECIFICALLY TO

02:03:36.408 --> 02:03:39.145
THAT POPULATION.

02:03:39.211 --> 02:03:41.213
SO FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES SCHOOLS

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:42.948
TO BEGIN IDENTIFYING AND SERVING

02:03:43.015 --> 02:03:45.084
CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AT

02:03:45.151 --> 02:03:47.219
AGE.

02:03:47.286 --> 02:03:47.920
THREE THESE CHILDREN CAN BE

02:03:47.987 --> 02:03:51.090
SERVED AND ONE OF THREE GENERAL

02:03:51.157 --> 02:03:53.425
SETTINGS EITHER -- THE

02:03:53.492 --> 02:03:54.627
MAINSTREAM PRESCHOOL SETTING

02:03:54.693 --> 02:03:56.729
SUCH AS YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER

02:03:56.796 --> 02:03:58.831
STATE PRESCHOOL OR THE FEDERAL

02:03:58.898 --> 02:04:00.800
HEAD START PROGRAM.

02:04:00.866 --> 02:04:02.234
LATEST DATA SUGGEST THAT A

02:04:02.301 --> 02:04:04.103
LITTLE LESS THAN HALF OF

02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:05.437
CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ARE

02:04:05.504 --> 02:04:08.207
SERVED IN SUCH PROGRAMS.

02:04:08.274 --> 02:04:10.142
ABOUT A THIRD OF CHILDREN WITH

02:04:10.209 --> 02:04:11.944
DISABILITIES ARE SERVED AND

02:04:12.011 --> 02:04:14.647
SPECIAL PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT

02:04:14.713 --> 02:04:16.649
ONLY SERVE OTHERS SOON OUR OTHER

02:04:16.715 --> 02:04:18.050
CHILDREN WITH DISABILITES.

02:04:18.117 --> 02:04:20.619
AND OF THE REMAINDER.

02:04:20.686 --> 02:04:22.121
ABOUT A QUARTER.

02:04:22.188 --> 02:04:24.056
I'D AREN'T RECEIVING ANY

02:04:24.123 --> 02:04:26.759
COMPREHENSIVE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM

02:04:26.826 --> 02:04:28.327
BUT ARE JUST RECEIVING SOME.

02:04:28.394 --> 02:04:29.428
CIVIC ADD ON SERVICES SUCH AS

02:04:29.495 --> 02:04:31.764
SPEECH THERAPY.

02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:33.866
L. AS NOTED EARLIER WE'VE SEEN A

02:04:33.933 --> 02:04:35.367
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE

02:04:35.434 --> 02:04:36.569
NUMBER OF PRE SCHOOL AGE

02:04:36.635 --> 02:04:37.937
CHILDREN RECEIVING SPECIAL

02:04:38.003 --> 02:04:40.172
EDUCATION SERVICES CALIFORNIA'S

02:04:40.239 --> 02:04:42.875
SCHOOLS SERVED ABOUT. FIFTY

02:04:42.942 --> 02:04:45.344
THOUSAND OF THESE CHILDREN AND

02:04:45.411 --> 02:04:46.412
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WHICH IS AN

02:04:46.478 --> 02:04:49.215
INCREASE OF ABOUT 25% FROM A

02:04:49.281 --> 02:04:50.916
DECADE PRIOR.

02:04:50.983 --> 02:04:54.153
AND ACCORDINGLY COSTS OF ALSO

02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:56.755
GONE UP -- SO IN THE LATEST DATA

02:04:56.822 --> 02:04:59.191
FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

02:04:59.258 --> 02:04:59.758
EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS

02:04:59.825 --> 02:05:01.827
REPORTED SPENDING ABOUT SIX

02:05:01.894 --> 02:05:02.528
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION.

02:05:02.595 --> 02:05:05.397
ON THESE SERVICES AND THAT'S UP

02:05:05.464 --> 02:05:07.166
FROM ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY

02:05:07.233 --> 02:05:08.734
MILLION.

02:05:08.801 --> 02:05:10.436
A DECADE PRIOR.

02:05:10.502 --> 02:05:12.504
WELL THE LAST THING TO NOTE HERE

02:05:12.571 --> 02:05:14.740
IS THAT THESE COSTS ARE COVERED.

02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:16.842
UP.

02:05:16.909 --> 02:05:19.211
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BY THE LOCAL

02:05:19.278 --> 02:05:20.746
GENERAL PURPOSE SHARE.

02:05:20.813 --> 02:05:22.081
OF SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:05:22.147 --> 02:05:23.382
EXPENDITURES THE FEDERAL

02:05:23.449 --> 02:05:24.483
GOVERNMENT PROVIDE SOME

02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:26.452
CATEGORICAL FUNDING SPECIFICALLY

02:05:26.518 --> 02:05:28.020
FOR THIS POPULATION AND COVERS

02:05:28.087 --> 02:05:30.689
ABOUT 20% OF THE ASSOCIATED

02:05:30.756 --> 02:05:31.790
COSTS BUT THE STATE CURRENTLY

02:05:31.857 --> 02:05:33.592
PROVIDES NO SPECIFIC FUNDING FOR

02:05:33.659 --> 02:05:35.261
THIS THAT STATE CATEGORICAL

02:05:35.327 --> 02:05:37.296
FUNDING. FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:05:37.363 --> 02:05:37.963

THE FIFTH PAGE RAISES A COUPLE

02:05:45.971 --> 02:05:47.640
OTHER ISSUES WITH SPECIAL

02:05:47.706 --> 02:05:48.874
EDUCATION FUNDING THAT WE

02:05:48.941 --> 02:05:52.912
COMMONLY HEAR ABOUT. ONE IS THAT.

02:05:52.978 --> 02:05:55.581
OUR PRIMARY ALLOCATION FORMULA

02:05:55.648 --> 02:05:56.415
FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:05:56.482 --> 02:05:59.151
CATEGORICAL DOLLARS IS BASED ON

02:05:59.218 --> 02:06:01.253
ACCOUNT OF TOTAL STUDENT

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:03.188
ATTENDANCE -- IN EACH STUDENT

02:06:03.255 --> 02:06:04.990
WHO SHOWS UP REGARDLESS OF

02:06:05.057 --> 02:06:06.592
WHETHER THEY HAVE DISABILITIES

02:06:06.659 --> 02:06:09.028
AND NOT GENERATES A FUNDING RATE.

02:06:09.094 --> 02:06:10.930
FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION BUT THOSE

02:06:10.996 --> 02:06:12.798
RATES VARY QUITE NOTABLY ACROSS

02:06:12.865 --> 02:06:13.832
THE STATE.

02:06:13.899 --> 02:06:15.334
FROM LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED

02:06:15.401 --> 02:06:16.702
DOLLARS IN SOME REGIONS TO MORE

02:06:16.769 --> 02:06:18.203
THAN NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND

02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:19.138
OTHER REGIONS.

02:06:19.204 --> 02:06:20.406
THAT THERE'S NO.

02:06:20.472 --> 02:06:24.910
REAL POLICY RATIONALE FOR THIS

02:06:24.977 --> 02:06:26.078
INEQUITY THIS IS A RESULT OF

02:06:26.145 --> 02:06:27.479
VARIOUS HISTORICAL FACTORS WHICH

02:06:27.546 --> 02:06:29.214
HAVE BEEN GRANDFATHERED AND AND

02:06:29.281 --> 02:06:30.783
IT'S SOMETHING BUT PARTICULARLY

02:06:30.849 --> 02:06:32.484
THE REGION'S RECEIVING THE LOWER

02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:33.018
RATES.

02:06:33.085 --> 02:06:38.691
OFTEN A COME TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:06:38.757 --> 02:06:39.959
TO ASK FOR CORRECTION.

02:06:40.025 --> 02:06:41.794
THE OTHER ISSUE WE HEAR A LOT

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:42.628
ABOUT IS THAT.

02:06:42.695 --> 02:06:43.262
THIS PRACTICE OF GIVING FUNDING

02:06:43.329 --> 02:06:44.530
BASED ON OVERALL STUDENT

02:06:44.596 --> 02:06:46.832
ATTENDANCE BY DESIGN DOES NOT

02:06:46.899 --> 02:06:48.367
ACCOUNT FOR ANY.

02:06:48.434 --> 02:06:51.170
REGIONAL VARIATIONS AND COSTS SO

02:06:51.236 --> 02:06:52.638
WE DO HAVE THESE INEQUITIES THE

02:06:52.705 --> 02:06:55.107
INEQUITIES AREN'T SAY LINK TO

02:06:55.174 --> 02:06:57.109
THE INCIDENCE OF STUDENTS WITH

02:06:57.176 --> 02:06:59.311
DISABILITIES ARE THE SERVICES

02:06:59.378 --> 02:07:00.346
THAT THOSE STUDENTS ARE BEING

02:07:00.412 --> 02:07:01.547
PROVIDED.

02:07:01.613 --> 02:07:03.282
WE DO KNOW THAT BOTH THE

02:07:03.349 --> 02:07:05.117
INCIDENCE AND THE COST OF

02:07:05.184 --> 02:07:06.285
SERVING STUDENTS WITH

02:07:06.352 --> 02:07:08.220
DISABILITIES FAIRIES NOTABLY

02:07:08.287 --> 02:07:10.522
AROUND THE STATE FROM -- SOME

02:07:10.589 --> 02:07:12.725
REGIONS IDENTIFY FEWER THAN 10%

02:07:12.791 --> 02:07:14.059
OF THEIR STUDENTS AS HAVING

02:07:14.126 --> 02:07:17.029
DISABILITIES OTHERS NEARLY 20%.

02:07:17.096 --> 02:07:19.798
THE ASSOCIATED COSTS RANGE FROM

02:07:19.865 --> 02:07:21.734
LESS THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:23.202
STUDENT IN SOME REGIONS STONE

02:07:23.268 --> 02:07:25.871
MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:26.839
IN OTHER REGIONS.

02:07:26.905 --> 02:07:27.406
THE STATE'S CRRENT FUNDING

02:07:27.473 --> 02:07:28.607
FORMULA DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR

02:07:28.674 --> 02:07:32.144
SUCH VARIATIONS NOW THE PREVIOUS

02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:33.946
US STAND FUNDING FORMULAS DID

02:07:34.013 --> 02:07:36.915
AND THEY WERE SCRAPS AND IN PART

02:07:36.982 --> 02:07:38.751
BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ABOUT.

02:07:38.817 --> 02:07:40.552
A GROWING ADMINISTRATIVE

02:07:40.619 --> 02:07:43.022
COMPLEXITY IN SOME CASES THERE

02:07:43.088 --> 02:07:44.456
IS CONCERNS THAT THEY WERE.

02:07:44.523 --> 02:07:45.824
CREATING AN APPROPRIATE FISCAL

02:07:45.891 --> 02:07:47.726
INCENTIVES BUT THIS IS AN

02:07:47.793 --> 02:07:50.162
ONGOING ISSUE AT THAT TIME I'M

02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:51.930
SURE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT.

02:07:51.997 --> 02:07:53.399
THAT THE FINAL PAGE OF THE

02:07:53.465 --> 02:07:55.234
HANDOUT COVERS THE GOVERNOR'S

02:07:55.300 --> 02:07:58.137
PROPOSAL. FOR SEED MINISTRATION

02:07:58.203 --> 02:07:59.605
JUST DESCRIBED WERE.

02:07:59.671 --> 02:08:00.906
OF WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE

02:08:00.973 --> 02:08:02.941
LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL

02:08:03.008 --> 02:08:04.643
AND WE HAVE A COUPLE SPECIFIC

02:08:04.710 --> 02:08:06.512
CONCERNS FIRST.

02:08:06.578 --> 02:08:08.981
OF WE JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT

02:08:09.048 --> 02:08:11.116
THE PROPOSAL'S LIKELY TO ACHIEVE

02:08:11.183 --> 02:08:13.685
THE ADMINISTRATION'S STATED

02:08:13.752 --> 02:08:15.587
GOALS OF WHILE THEY INDICATE

02:08:15.654 --> 02:08:17.222
THAT.

02:08:17.289 --> 02:08:18.624
THE FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO BE

02:08:18.690 --> 02:08:21.160
SPENT ON ADDITIONAL SERVICES

02:08:21.226 --> 02:08:22.461
THAT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

02:08:22.528 --> 02:08:24.229
ARE NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVING OR

02:08:24.296 --> 02:08:26.331
EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS THAT

02:08:26.398 --> 02:08:27.800
MIGHT DAY FOR STUDENTS FROM

02:08:27.866 --> 02:08:29.334
REQUIRING SPECIAL EDUCATION.

02:08:29.401 --> 02:08:31.003
THE ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL

02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:33.005
LANGUAGE IS NOT CONTROLLING UGH

02:08:33.072 --> 02:08:34.440
IN FACT THE FUNDS COULD BE USED

02:08:34.506 --> 02:08:36.375
FOR ANY PURPOSE WE BELIEVE BASED

02:08:36.442 --> 02:08:38.277
ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:08:38.343 --> 02:08:39.778
ADMINISTRATORS ACROSS THE STATE

02:08:39.845 --> 02:08:40.312
THAT.

02:08:40.379 --> 02:08:42.114
MANY OF THEM ARE CALLING OUT FOR

02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:43.615
ADDITIONAL CATEGORICAL FUNDING

02:08:43.682 --> 02:08:44.917
JUST TO COVER THEIR EXISTING

02:08:44.983 --> 02:08:47.619
SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS AND WILL

02:08:47.686 --> 02:08:50.389
LIKELY INTERPRET -- THE SPECIAL

02:08:50.456 --> 02:08:52.124
EDUCATION CONCENTRATION GRANTS

02:08:52.191 --> 02:08:54.093
IT'S JUST THAT AND PUT THAT

02:08:54.159 --> 02:08:54.827
TOWARDS.

02:08:54.893 --> 02:08:57.896
COVERING THEIR EXISTING PROGRAMS --

02:08:57.963 --> 02:08:59.198
WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS

02:08:59.264 --> 02:09:01.100
BETTER OPTIONS FOR AUGMENTING

02:09:01.166 --> 02:09:03.202
STATE CATEGORICAL FUNDING IF

02:09:03.268 --> 02:09:04.169
INDEED THAT'S WHAT WHAT IT'S

02:09:04.236 --> 02:09:05.304
GOING TO BE USED.

02:09:05.370 --> 02:09:06.672
FOR ROSS OF CONCERN SPECIFICALLY

02:09:06.738 --> 02:09:09.374
AIMED AT THE ADMINISTRATION

02:09:09.441 --> 02:09:09.675
[inaudible]

02:09:09.741 --> 02:09:11.777
HAS INDICATED.

02:09:11.844 --> 02:09:13.946
THEY WOULD LIKE TO INVEST IN

02:09:14.012 --> 02:09:16.048
EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS THAT.

02:09:16.115 --> 02:09:18.383
REDUCE THE IDENTIFICATION RATE

02:09:18.450 --> 02:09:19.651
FOR SINCE -- IN SPECIAL

02:09:19.718 --> 02:09:21.753
EDUCATION -- BUT WE THINK THAT

02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:23.589
THE FISCAL INCENTIVES CREATED BY

02:09:23.655 --> 02:09:24.923
THEIR PROPOSAL ACTUALLY WORK

02:09:24.990 --> 02:09:26.391
COUNTER THAT.

02:09:26.458 --> 02:09:29.261
IN FACT -- FOR EVERY STUDENT

02:09:29.328 --> 02:09:31.730
THAT ARE A DISTRICT THAT WAS

02:09:31.797 --> 02:09:33.432
RECEIVING A SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:09:33.499 --> 02:09:34.867
CONCENTRATION GRANT.

02:09:34.933 --> 02:09:36.502
THAT NO LONGER IDENTIFIED FOR

02:09:36.568 --> 02:09:38.036
SPECIAL EDUCATION THAT DISTRICT

02:09:38.103 --> 02:09:41.373
WOULD BE OUT ABOUT EIGHT

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:41.940
THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ON GOING

02:09:42.007 --> 02:09:42.574
FUNDING.

02:09:42.641 --> 02:09:43.509
WE THINK THAT SENDS A STRONG

02:09:43.575 --> 02:09:45.177
FISCAL INCENTIVES THAT ACTUALLY

02:09:45.244 --> 02:09:46.111
PUSHES IN THE OTHER DIRECTION

02:09:46.178 --> 02:09:47.880
THAT YOU SHOULD IDENTIFY MORE

02:09:47.946 --> 02:09:48.213
CHILDREN NOT.

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:50.249
FEWER.

02:09:50.315 --> 02:09:51.583
AS MENTIONED BEFORE WE THINK THE

02:09:51.650 --> 02:09:53.085
LEGISLATURE HAS OTHER OPTIONS

02:09:53.152 --> 02:09:55.721
FOR AUGMENTING FUNDING AND WE DO

02:09:55.787 --> 02:09:57.589
OUTLINED A COUPLE.

02:09:57.656 --> 02:10:00.425
ON THE AS OF LAST BULLET.

02:10:00.492 --> 02:10:02.227
HI THERE THE LEGISLATURE COULD

02:10:02.294 --> 02:10:04.596
EQUALIZE PERCENT FUNDING RATES

02:10:04.663 --> 02:10:06.732
OR COULD DEDICATE SOME STATE

02:10:06.798 --> 02:10:08.734
CATEGORICAL FUNDING SPECIFICALLY

02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:10.235
FOR FOR PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN

02:10:10.302 --> 02:10:12.137
WITH DISABILITIES -- EITHER

02:10:12.204 --> 02:10:13.005
THESE PROPOSALS COULD BE

02:10:13.071 --> 02:10:14.873
STRUCTURED IN A NUMBER OF WAYS

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:17.509
AND HOW YOU STRUCTURE IT.

02:10:17.576 --> 02:10:19.745
WOULD ULTIMATELY -- DETERMINE

02:10:19.811 --> 02:10:21.146
HOW MUCH IT COSTS BUT WE THINK

02:10:21.213 --> 02:10:24.283
EITHER APPROACH COULD BE ADOPTED

02:10:24.349 --> 02:10:27.519
WITHIN THE AMOUNT THAT SET ASIDE

02:10:27.586 --> 02:10:28.987
FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

02:10:29.054 --> 02:10:30.756
THAT'S IT FOR MY REMARKS SO WITH

02:10:30.822 --> 02:10:33.358
RESPECT TO EQUALIZATION ON PAGE

02:10:33.425 --> 02:10:35.394
FIVE YOUR YOUR FIRST BULLET --

02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:36.995
WITH THE WITH THE RATES VARYING

02:10:37.062 --> 02:10:38.263
FROM FOREIGN EIGHTY EIGHT

02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:39.998
DOLLARS TO NINE HUNDRED AND

02:10:40.065 --> 02:10:41.366
THIRTY SIX DOLLARS PER STUDENT.

02:10:41.433 --> 02:10:43.869
EQUALIZATION WITH EQUAL EQUALIZE

02:10:43.936 --> 02:10:45.537
THOSE PER STUDENT RATES.

02:10:45.604 --> 02:10:47.072
THE U. S. SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF

02:10:47.139 --> 02:10:49.374
WAYS THE A. B. E. YOU COULD DO

02:10:49.441 --> 02:10:51.743
IT AT THE OF BUTTON THE GENERAL

02:10:51.810 --> 02:10:53.645
CONCEPT IS THAT YOU SAID SOME

02:10:53.712 --> 02:10:57.382
TARGET -- SAY THE NINETIETH

02:10:57.449 --> 02:10:58.450
PERCENTILE.

02:10:58.517 --> 02:11:01.987
BAD 90% OF OF FOLKS CURRENTLY

02:11:02.054 --> 02:11:03.555
ARE RECEIVING EITHER THAT RATE

02:11:03.622 --> 02:11:04.890
OR A LOWER RATE AND THEN YOU

02:11:04.957 --> 02:11:06.658
LIFT EVERYONE WHO'S AT A LOWER

02:11:06.725 --> 02:11:07.960
RATE UP TO THAT AMOUNT.

02:11:08.026 --> 02:11:10.095
WE ESTIMATE THAT COST ABOUT

02:11:10.162 --> 02:11:10.829
THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE

02:11:10.896 --> 02:11:12.164
MILLION DOLLARS IT WOULD STILL

02:11:12.231 --> 02:11:13.999
LEAVE SOME INEQUITIES RIGHT

02:11:14.066 --> 02:11:15.334
BECAUSE YOU'D HAVE THAT TOP TEN

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:16.368
PERCENTILE WOULD STILL BE

02:11:16.435 --> 02:11:19.471
RECEIVING -- THEIR HISTORICAL

02:11:19.538 --> 02:11:21.306
FUNDING LEVELS BUT IF YOU WERE

02:11:21.373 --> 02:11:23.275
TO FULLY EQUALIZE WOULD COST

02:11:23.342 --> 02:11:25.310
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE.

02:11:25.377 --> 02:11:27.045
AND THE COST OF THE PROVIDING

02:11:27.112 --> 02:11:29.114
DEDICATED STATE FUNDING FOR

02:11:29.181 --> 02:11:30.515
PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN.

02:11:30.582 --> 02:11:32.150
A IT WOULD DEPEND AGAIN ON HOW

02:11:32.217 --> 02:11:33.252
YOU STRUCTURE THAT I KNOW THAT

02:11:33.318 --> 02:11:34.853
THERE ARE A NUMBER PROPOSALS OUT

02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:37.022
THERE BUT YOU COULD -- EASILY

02:11:37.089 --> 02:11:38.690
STRUCTURE IN A WAY THAT COST

02:11:38.757 --> 02:11:40.292
SOMEWHERE AROUND THREE HUNDRED

02:11:40.359 --> 02:11:41.893
MILLION DOLLARS SAYS SIMILAR TO

02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:49.935
THE GOVERNOR'S ON GOING PROPOSAL.

02:11:50.002 --> 02:11:51.803
WELL OR POORLY OF SOME SCHOOLS

02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:53.605
IN SOMERS STATER IDENTIFYING

02:11:53.672 --> 02:11:55.907
FEWER THAN 10% OF THEIR STUDENTS

02:11:55.974 --> 02:11:57.042
FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION.

02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:58.510
THOSE SCHOOLS MUST BE RECEIVED

02:11:58.577 --> 02:12:01.146
BUT THE BUT THE BUT THE FUNDING

02:12:01.213 --> 02:12:03.115
IS DISTRIBUTED ON A PER STUDENT

02:12:03.181 --> 02:12:04.716
BASIS THOSE SCHOOLS.

02:12:04.783 --> 02:12:06.285
MUST BE RECEIVING A SUFFICIENT

02:12:06.351 --> 02:12:07.853
AMOUNT OF MONEY TO EDUCATE THE

02:12:07.919 --> 02:12:10.022
SPECIAL NEEDS.

02:12:10.088 --> 02:12:10.622
COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE WORKING

02:12:10.689 --> 02:12:11.556
WITH.

02:12:11.623 --> 02:12:17.029
YEAH WE FIND THE A IF YOU WERE

02:12:17.095 --> 02:12:17.663
TO LOOK AT THIS DIVISION INTO

02:12:17.729 --> 02:12:21.166
THE THREE POTS OF FUNDING RIGHT

02:12:21.233 --> 02:12:22.467
THE LOCAL THE LOCAL SHARE THE

02:12:22.534 --> 02:12:24.736
FEDERAL SHARE THIS STATE SURE

02:12:24.803 --> 02:12:25.937
THAT WE CALLED OUT.

02:12:26.004 --> 02:12:26.571
IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THAT --

02:12:26.638 --> 02:12:28.240
ACROSS ALL THE VARIOUS REGIONS

02:12:28.307 --> 02:12:30.042
IN THE STATE AT THE EXTREME

02:12:30.108 --> 02:12:32.878
LEVEL YOU DO FIND THAT SOME HAVE --

02:12:32.944 --> 02:12:35.013
NEARLY 90% OF THEIR COSTS

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:37.249
COVERED BY STATE CATEGORICAL

02:12:37.316 --> 02:12:38.917
FUNDING THAT'S CLEARLY NOT THE

02:12:38.984 --> 02:12:40.719
STORY FOR MOST OF THE STATE BUT

02:12:40.786 --> 02:12:42.521
IN SOME PLACES THAT IS THE CASE.

02:12:42.587 --> 02:12:45.123
AND IF WE CHANGE THE SYSTEM TO

02:12:45.190 --> 02:12:46.258
PROVIDING FUNDING BASED ON

02:12:46.325 --> 02:12:48.560
STUDENTS WHO HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS.

02:12:48.627 --> 02:12:50.529
POST TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS

02:12:50.595 --> 02:12:53.732
ACROSS THE BOARD -- WITH THAT

02:12:53.799 --> 02:12:56.568
DRIVE UP THE IDENTIFICATION RATE

02:12:56.635 --> 02:12:58.403
FOR SPECIAL NEEDS.

02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:59.071
ED.

02:12:59.137 --> 02:13:00.972
IT'S A SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL

02:13:01.039 --> 02:13:04.009
POINT AND THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT

02:13:04.076 --> 02:13:05.177
QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S THAT

02:13:05.243 --> 02:13:07.112
POLICY IDEA THAT HAS BEEN

02:13:07.179 --> 02:13:08.513
CONSIDERED FOR MANY YEARS.

02:13:08.580 --> 02:13:09.881
AND I KNOW IF YOU'D ASKED THIS

02:13:09.948 --> 02:13:11.750
QUESTION OF SOME ADMINISTRATORS

02:13:11.817 --> 02:13:13.318
THEY TELL YOU THE ANSWERS NOW

02:13:13.385 --> 02:13:14.486
THAT.

02:13:14.553 --> 02:13:17.189
THEY IDENTIFY BASED SOLELY ON

02:13:17.255 --> 02:13:19.925
WHAT THE APPROPRIATE DIAGNOSIS

02:13:19.991 --> 02:13:22.127
IS AND THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER

02:13:22.194 --> 02:13:23.995
THAT BUT THE THE LITERATURE DOES

02:13:24.062 --> 02:13:26.031
SUGGEST THAT THE ANSWER IS YES

02:13:26.098 --> 02:13:27.866
AND STATES THAT DO PROVIDE.

02:13:27.933 --> 02:13:30.936
FUNDING BASED ON AN ACCOUNT OF

02:13:31.002 --> 02:13:32.938
STUDENTS IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIAL

02:13:33.004 --> 02:13:34.406
EDUCATION.

02:13:34.473 --> 02:13:35.173
THOSE STATES HAVE HIGHER

02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:36.708
IDENTIFICATION RATES THAN STATES

02:13:36.775 --> 02:13:38.210
THAT HAVE FUNDING SINCE SYSTEM

02:13:38.276 --> 02:13:39.778
SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIA AND I

02:13:39.845 --> 02:13:42.481
WASN'T IN THE QUESTION

02:13:42.547 --> 02:13:43.382
SUGGESTING THAT.

02:13:43.448 --> 02:13:44.249
WITH THE CHANGE PEOPLE WOULD

02:13:44.316 --> 02:13:44.783
GAME THE SYSTEM I'M JUST

02:13:44.850 --> 02:13:45.751
WONDERING.

02:13:45.817 --> 02:13:47.719
WITH THE FUNDING ACROSS THE

02:13:47.786 --> 02:13:49.488
BOARD FUNDING.

02:13:49.554 --> 02:13:50.655
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE TODAY I

02:13:50.722 --> 02:13:54.025
WONDER IF THERE'S THERE'S NO

02:13:54.092 --> 02:13:54.860
NEED.

02:13:54.926 --> 02:13:56.395
TO PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO

02:13:56.461 --> 02:13:57.662
THE IDENTIFICATION.

02:13:57.729 --> 02:13:59.097
IT'S ALSO A GOOD POINT THAT

02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:01.032
YOU'LL HEAR -- IF YOU TALK TO

02:14:01.099 --> 02:14:02.868
THE FIELD THERE IS SOME CONCERN

02:14:02.934 --> 02:14:05.537
THAT -- THAT THERE'S DANGER IN

02:14:05.604 --> 02:14:07.272
GOING TOO FAR IN THE OTHER

02:14:07.339 --> 02:14:09.474
EXTREME THAT PERHAPS OUR CURRENT

02:14:09.541 --> 02:14:11.276
FUNDING SYSTEM IS OFFERING A

02:14:11.343 --> 02:14:13.645
FISCAL DISINCENTIVE TO IDENT TO

02:14:13.712 --> 02:14:15.747
PROPERLY IDENTIFYING SUBSTANCE

02:14:15.814 --> 02:14:16.615
THAT SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED WITH

02:14:16.681 --> 02:14:18.316
AND JUST A COMMON IN A PERFECT

02:14:18.383 --> 02:14:19.351
WORLD WE WOULD.

02:14:19.418 --> 02:14:21.820
CLEARLY AND ACCURATELY IDENTIFY

02:14:21.887 --> 02:14:22.387
THOSE STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL

02:14:22.454 --> 02:14:23.555
NEEDS.

02:14:23.622 --> 02:14:25.290
AND THEN WE WOULD CLEARLY AND

02:14:25.357 --> 02:14:26.792
COMPLETELY PROVIDE ALL OF THE

02:14:26.858 --> 02:14:28.794
MONEY TO THE DISTRICTS NECESSARY

02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:30.862
TO PROVIDE THE EDUCATIONAL

02:14:30.929 --> 02:14:33.131
SERVICES WITH THE STUDENTS HER.

YEARS I'VE LEARNED THAT

02:14:39.604 --> 02:14:41.239
CERTAINLY IN THE BUDGET PROCESS

02:14:41.306 --> 02:14:42.841

TOP OF MINES IN MANY OF THE

02:15:11.603 --> 02:15:13.171
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD

02:15:13.238 --> 02:15:13.905
WITH DISTRICTS AND CHARTER

CURRENT YEAR.

02:18:21.292 --> 02:18:22.460
FOR COMING UP WITH A AND A

02:18:22.527 --> 02:18:23.561
FINANCE COULD PROBABLY SPEAK

02:18:23.628 --> 02:18:24.896
BETTER THAN I COULD ABOUT THE

02:18:24.963 --> 02:18:26.798
DIFFERENT PROPOSALS THAT WERE

02:18:26.865 --> 02:18:29.134
LOOKING AT TRYING TO GET -- MORE

ITEM THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH

02:18:39.678 --> 02:18:42.514
HERE BUT I DO THINK THAT'S AN

02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:43.314
ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE.

02:18:43.381 --> 02:18:45.617
TO TO FOCUS ON GIVEN THE

02:18:45.684 --> 02:18:47.318
IMPORTANCE OF THIS PARTICULAR

02:18:47.385 --> 02:18:48.820
ISSUE IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

02:18:48.887 --> 02:18:50.789
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:18:50.855 --> 02:18:53.825
HOWEVER ADEQUATE ARE INADEQUATE.

02:18:53.892 --> 02:18:55.627
TO CONTINUING TO MOVE TOWARDS

02:18:55.694 --> 02:19:00.799
SOLVING THE ISSUE [inaudible]

02:19:00.865 --> 02:19:03.134
ZERO YEAH I CLOSER FIRST OF ALL

02:19:03.201 --> 02:19:05.036
IT JUST SEND IN AS A BIT OF A

02:19:05.103 --> 02:19:06.004
COMMENT.

02:19:06.071 --> 02:19:06.471
TO AYE.

02:19:06.538 --> 02:19:08.707
YOUR WIFE QUESTION MISTER.

02:19:08.773 --> 02:19:10.008
YOU KNOW I REALLY WOULD PUSH

02:19:10.075 --> 02:19:13.712
BACK ON THE IDEA THAT -- THAT

02:19:13.778 --> 02:19:17.816
THERE IS A SERIOUS DANGER OF

02:19:17.882 --> 02:19:19.517
INCENTIVIZING OVER

02:19:19.584 --> 02:19:21.219
IDENTIFICATION.

02:19:21.286 --> 02:19:22.554
THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS

02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:24.255
BECAUSE EVEN IF WE CREATE A

02:19:24.322 --> 02:19:25.824
SYSTEM.

02:19:25.890 --> 02:19:27.292
THAT MIGHT DOES A MUCH BETTER

02:19:27.358 --> 02:19:30.328
JOB OF REFLECTING THE COSTS

02:19:30.395 --> 02:19:31.663
ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL ED.

02:19:31.730 --> 02:19:33.965
ON THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:19:34.032 --> 02:19:36.167
IT WILL STILL BE A FRACTION.

02:19:36.234 --> 02:19:38.303
OF THE THE REAL COST AND WE

02:19:38.369 --> 02:19:39.704
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE EVER GOING

02:19:39.771 --> 02:19:41.106
TO FIND.

02:19:41.172 --> 02:19:41.973
THESE PROGRAMS THAT HAD A

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:44.042
PERCENT SO EVEN IF WE DID A BET

02:19:44.109 --> 02:19:45.410
EVEN IF WE MET THAT YOU KNOW A

02:19:45.477 --> 02:19:46.311
LITTLE SAY THE FEDERAL

02:19:46.377 --> 02:19:47.212
GOVERNMENT SO WE CAME UP WITH

02:19:47.278 --> 02:19:48.646
THE 40% THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO

02:19:48.713 --> 02:19:50.815
COME UP WITH OF THE COST SO SEE

02:19:50.882 --> 02:19:51.583
WITH IDA.

02:19:51.649 --> 02:19:53.918
I INSTEAD OF THE ELEVEN OR 12%

02:19:53.985 --> 02:19:55.186
THAT THEY'RE COMING UP WITH.

02:19:55.253 --> 02:19:59.090
I THERE WOULD STILL BE --

02:19:59.157 --> 02:20:01.226
FINANCIAL DISINCENTIVE.

02:20:01.292 --> 02:20:02.093
AND JUST TO TALK REALLY COLEY

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:02.994
ABOUT THIS BUT A FINANCIAL

02:20:03.061 --> 02:20:04.195
DISINCENTIVE. FOR SCHOOL

02:20:04.262 --> 02:20:06.297
DISTRICT.

02:20:06.364 --> 02:20:10.535
OUR ALLEY A TO TO YOU KNOW TO TO

02:20:10.602 --> 02:20:12.003
TO HAVE A SPECIAL I CAN'T.

02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:13.404
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COSTS

02:20:13.471 --> 02:20:15.840
ASSOCIATED SO IT'S ONE OF THE

02:20:15.907 --> 02:20:17.742
REASONS WHY I'VE BEEN IN REALLY

02:20:17.809 --> 02:20:20.245
TRYING AND WE'VE TALKED A BIT --

02:20:20.311 --> 02:20:22.046
AT WITH FOLKS FROM OUT LA -- AND

02:20:22.113 --> 02:20:23.314
AND THE THE SENATE EDUCATION

02:20:23.381 --> 02:20:24.115
COMMITTEE HAD A HEARING ON THIS

02:20:24.182 --> 02:20:25.784
AYE AYE AYE PRO I WANTED TO BE

02:20:25.850 --> 02:20:26.351
HERE TODAY.

02:20:26.417 --> 02:20:27.285
WAS BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO

02:20:27.352 --> 02:20:28.920
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HAVE THE

02:20:28.987 --> 02:20:31.422
SYSTEM BETTER REFLECT THE COST

02:20:31.489 --> 02:20:32.123
SO.

02:20:32.190 --> 02:20:34.192
EVEN UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY'RE

02:20:34.259 --> 02:20:36.461
NEVER GOING -- TO FULLY

02:20:36.528 --> 02:20:37.996
REIMBURSED THE DISTRICTS.

02:20:38.062 --> 02:20:39.097
AFTER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED IN

02:20:39.164 --> 02:20:41.399
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE IS JUST

02:20:41.466 --> 02:20:42.667
SO MUCH TENSION.

02:20:42.734 --> 02:20:44.769
ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT

02:20:44.836 --> 02:20:48.072
OF AN OF AYE EP'S -- THERE IS

02:20:48.139 --> 02:20:49.908
YOU KNOW THE THE DISTRICTS NO --

02:20:49.974 --> 02:20:51.776
THE COSTS ASSOCIATED IT CREATES

02:20:51.843 --> 02:20:53.711
VERY INTENSE NEGOTIATIONS WITH

02:20:53.778 --> 02:20:56.080
FAMILIES THAT CAN OFTENTIMES I'D

02:20:56.147 --> 02:20:58.082
TURN INTO.

02:20:58.149 --> 02:20:59.784
A VERY EXPENSIVE LITIGATION.

02:20:59.851 --> 02:21:02.453
I EIGHT AND AND IT'S BECOME A

02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:03.388
REAL TENSION POINT OUR

02:21:03.454 --> 02:21:04.656
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM I SAY THIS

02:21:04.722 --> 02:21:05.623
HAVING SERVED ON THE SCHOOL

BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A ANY KIND

02:21:26.110 --> 02:21:27.745
OF DANGER OF OVER IDENTIFICATION.

02:21:27.812 --> 02:21:29.681
GIVEN THE MACRO COSTS AND

02:21:52.470 --> 02:21:55.940
AND OUT IN A PROPERLY REIMBURSES

02:21:56.007 --> 02:21:56.908

02:21:56.975 --> 02:21:58.376
REIMBURSED BUT BUT BUT DOES A

02:21:58.443 --> 02:21:59.811
BETTER JOB I SUPPOSE.

02:21:59.878 --> 02:22:01.479
OF REFLECTING THE REAL COSTS ON

02:22:01.546 --> 02:22:04.015
THE GROUND -- SO THAT WE CAN BE

02:22:04.082 --> 02:22:05.917
SERVING OUR SYSTEM BETTER.

02:22:05.984 --> 02:22:06.885
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO

02:22:06.951 --> 02:22:09.120
SEEK -- AND THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU

02:22:09.187 --> 02:22:10.655
IF ANYONE ON THE PANEL HAS ANY.

02:22:10.722 --> 02:22:12.123
KIND OF COMMENTS OR THOUGHTS ON

02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:12.724
THAT I KNOW THAT'S WHAT WE'VE

02:22:12.790 --> 02:22:16.594
ALL BEEN -- GOOD.

02:22:16.661 --> 02:22:17.395
ADDRESSING DOES THE COURSE

02:22:17.462 --> 02:22:19.097
DISCUSSION BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY

02:22:19.163 --> 02:22:20.498
ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS ON ON THAT.

02:22:20.565 --> 02:22:22.233
THAT DIFFICULT BOUNCES STRIKE I

02:22:22.300 --> 02:22:22.867
CERTAINLY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN

02:22:22.934 --> 02:22:28.406
HEARING.

02:22:28.473 --> 02:22:30.074
OF ALL IDLE TO THAT AT THE FIRST

02:22:30.141 --> 02:22:31.376
AID.

02:22:31.442 --> 02:22:33.711
APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING UP ALL

02:22:33.778 --> 02:22:37.548
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT AND

02:22:37.615 --> 02:22:38.549
AND ONE THAT'S OFTEN RAISED BUT

02:22:38.616 --> 02:22:40.752
I I NEGLECTED TO RAISE MY

02:22:40.818 --> 02:22:44.789
EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT -- HOW

02:22:44.856 --> 02:22:46.524
COULD AN INCENTIVE EXIST WHEN

02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:48.159
THE STATE'S ONLY GIVING THIRTY

02:22:48.226 --> 02:22:49.494
CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOR THE

02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:50.828
ASSOCIATED COSTS?

02:22:50.895 --> 02:22:52.797
I THINK THE ONE THING TO KEEP IN

02:22:52.864 --> 02:22:56.567
MIND -- IN FISCAL INCENTIVES CAN

02:22:56.634 --> 02:22:58.069
BE VERY TRICKY AND ONE THING

02:22:58.136 --> 02:22:58.903
THAT MAKES SOME PARTICULARLY

02:22:58.970 --> 02:23:03.308
TRICKY IN THIS AREA IS THE WIDE

02:23:03.374 --> 02:23:04.776
VARIANCE AND COSTS.

02:23:04.842 --> 02:23:06.577
IN SPECIAL EDUCATION ACROSS

02:23:06.644 --> 02:23:08.846
REGIONS AND ALSO BETWEEN VARIOUS

02:23:08.913 --> 02:23:11.950
CHILDREN IN SOME CASES --

02:23:12.016 --> 02:23:14.585
CHILDREN -- A DENTAL FIGHT FOR

02:23:14.652 --> 02:23:16.554
SPECIAL EDUCATION HAVE VERY

02:23:16.621 --> 02:23:18.623
INTENSIVE NEEDS AND REQUIRE

02:23:18.690 --> 02:23:19.958
COSTS THAT.

02:23:20.024 --> 02:23:22.727
ARE IN THE SIX DIGITS -- IN SOME

02:23:22.794 --> 02:23:25.596
CASES CHILDREN IDENTIFIED.

02:23:25.663 --> 02:23:28.733
HAVE RELATIVELY MILD MEANS AND

02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:30.635
MAY ONLY MADE A HALF HOUR OF

02:23:30.702 --> 02:23:33.471
SPEECH THERAPY A WEEK AND A AND

02:23:33.538 --> 02:23:34.806
IF YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING

02:23:34.872 --> 02:23:36.074
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THAT

02:23:36.140 --> 02:23:38.009
POPULATION OF CHILDREN THAT'S ON

02:23:38.076 --> 02:23:39.077
THE BUBBLE WHERE.

02:23:39.143 --> 02:23:41.679
THE MAY BE UNDER ONE FISCAL

02:23:41.746 --> 02:23:43.715
REGIME THEY'D BE IDENTIFIED.

02:23:43.781 --> 02:23:45.550
AS HAVING A DISABILITY BUT UNDER

02:23:45.616 --> 02:23:46.985
ANOTHER IF THEY WOULD NOT THOSE

02:23:47.051 --> 02:23:49.253
CHILDREN OFTEN WILL BE ON THE

02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:50.989
LESS EXPENSIVE RAIN RUSH.

02:23:51.055 --> 02:23:52.123
YEAH KNOW THAT THERE'S NO

02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:53.124
QUESTION ABOUT THAT AND THAT'S

02:23:53.191 --> 02:23:55.093
ACTUALLY ALSO PART OF THE STORY

02:23:55.159 --> 02:23:57.428
YOU KNOW AND THEY'RE THEY'RE

02:23:57.495 --> 02:23:58.129
THEY'RE OFTENTIMES QUITE.

02:23:58.196 --> 02:24:00.465
DRAMATIC RICK YOU KNOW.

02:24:00.531 --> 02:24:02.400
DIFFERENCES OBVIOUSLY BETWEEN

02:24:02.467 --> 02:24:04.002
BETWEEN AND SEVERITY OF NEEDS

02:24:04.068 --> 02:24:05.169
AND THEN THERE'S REALTORS COSTS

02:24:05.236 --> 02:24:06.838
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND MUCH

02:24:06.904 --> 02:24:07.538
LESS WITH OTHERS.

02:24:07.605 --> 02:24:11.542
ON LET ME I I'D LIKE TO ASK ONE

02:24:11.609 --> 02:24:13.077
QUESTION RELATED.

02:24:13.144 --> 02:24:15.046
TO I EARLY CHILDHOOD YOU TALKED

02:24:15.113 --> 02:24:16.714
ABOUT THAT ISSUE I MEAN IT IT IT

02:24:16.781 --> 02:24:19.550
IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE.

02:24:19.617 --> 02:24:20.785
IT YOU KNOW ALL THE RESEARCH

02:24:20.852 --> 02:24:22.153
SUGGESTS THAT.

02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:24.655
IF WE DO A BETTER JOB OF REALLY

02:24:24.722 --> 02:24:26.791
IDENTIFICATION AND THEY'RE BEING

02:24:26.858 --> 02:24:29.360
TREATMENT AND AND AND TARGETED.

02:24:29.427 --> 02:24:32.296
EDUCATION FOR THOSE LITTLE

02:24:32.363 --> 02:24:33.831
LITTLE ONES -- WHO?

02:24:33.898 --> 02:24:36.534
ARE HAVE A SPECIAL NEED ARE

02:24:36.601 --> 02:24:37.969
THERE ARE THERE ARE POTENTIAL

02:24:38.036 --> 02:24:40.571
TREMENDOUS COST SAVINGS DOWN THE

02:24:40.638 --> 02:24:42.106
LINE BECAUSE YOU CAN.

02:24:42.173 --> 02:24:44.042
YOU CAN REALLY GET OUT -- IT

02:24:44.108 --> 02:24:46.711
SOME OF THEM YOU KNOW THE THE

02:24:46.778 --> 02:24:49.514
THE IN THE THE CONDITIONS

02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:51.082
DISABILITIES THAT -- WILL WILL

02:24:51.149 --> 02:24:53.518
END UP BOTH BEING A SERIES COST

02:24:53.584 --> 02:24:55.553
PRESSURE BUT ALSO WROTE IT TO

02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:57.288
THOSE KIDS QUALITY OF LIFE.

02:24:57.355 --> 02:24:58.322
BOB AND YET IT'S THE ONE AREA

02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:59.791
WHERE WE SEEM.

02:24:59.857 --> 02:25:01.059
TO BE THE MOST UNDER FUNDED

02:25:01.125 --> 02:25:01.359
[inaudible]

02:25:01.426 --> 02:25:03.694
OUR SO [inaudible]

02:25:03.761 --> 02:25:06.397
JUST WANTED.

02:25:06.464 --> 02:25:08.232
IDENTIFY THAT I AND AND AND

02:25:08.299 --> 02:25:10.334
HIGHLIGHT THAT I WILL SAY I KNOW

02:25:10.401 --> 02:25:11.636
THERE'S THERE'S AN INTERESTING

02:25:11.702 --> 02:25:13.638
ISSUE THAT'S OUT THERE ABOUT THE

02:25:13.704 --> 02:25:14.906
HAND OFF THE TRANSITION

02:25:14.972 --> 02:25:15.206
[inaudible]

02:25:15.273 --> 02:25:17.375
FROM.

02:25:17.442 --> 02:25:19.877
I FROM WHEN CHILDREN.

02:25:19.944 --> 02:25:22.013
YOU KNOW -- REACHED.

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:24.115
RICH THREE YEARS OLD.

02:25:24.182 --> 02:25:25.183
ARE.

02:25:25.249 --> 02:25:26.250
YOU THERE REALLY DOES SEEM TO BE

02:25:26.317 --> 02:25:27.185
A SMOOTH TRANSITION INTO SCHOOL

02:25:27.251 --> 02:25:29.087
DISTRICT PROGRAMS FOR THREE YEAR

02:25:29.153 --> 02:25:30.788
OLDS FROM THE REGIONAL CENTERS.

02:25:30.855 --> 02:25:32.990
AND THAT'S AN AREA THAT I JUST

02:25:33.057 --> 02:25:34.125

ABOUT THAT TRANSITION AND SOME

02:25:43.835 --> 02:25:45.403
OF THE THE INFRASTRUCTURAL NEEDS

CENTERS TO HAVE AN I. F. S. P.

02:25:59.851 --> 02:26:01.953
THERE'S OFTEN -- A DISCONNECT

02:26:02.019 --> 02:26:02.987
BETWEEN WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY

CONCERN AND THE GOVERNOR'S

02:26:18.069 --> 02:26:19.103
AT LEAST THREE YEAR OLDS THESE

02:26:19.170 --> 02:26:20.204
INFANTS ARE NOT FALL INTO THE

02:26:20.271 --> 02:26:22.039
CRACKS AND ARE GETTING CONNECTED

02:26:22.106 --> 02:26:23.841
TO THE CORRECT SERVICES -- WHERE

THEY DO MAKE THOSE YOU KNOW THEY

02:26:25.743 --> 02:26:26.677
DO HAVE THIS GREAT OUTCOMES WHEN

THEY ARE CONNECTED TO SCHOOLS

02:26:28.546 --> 02:26:29.547
AND MANY ARE GETTING THOSE EARLY

02:26:29.614 --> 02:26:31.015
INTERVENTION SERVICES SO WE'RE

02:26:31.082 --> 02:26:32.150
DEFINITELY LOOKING INTO IT?

02:26:32.216 --> 02:26:35.019
WE HEAR YOUR CONCERNS -- AND

02:26:35.086 --> 02:26:36.420
WERE MOVING TOWARD SOMETHING IN

02:26:36.487 --> 02:26:40.558
THE MAIL THE VICE CRIED I'M

02:26:40.625 --> 02:26:41.192
REALLY EXCITED TO HEAR THAT I I

02:26:41.259 --> 02:26:41.559
JUST [inaudible]

02:26:41.626 --> 02:26:42.527
YOU KNOW.

02:26:42.593 --> 02:26:43.961
OBVIOUSLY IF THERE'S ANY

02:26:44.028 --> 02:26:45.129
ASSISTANCE WE CAN GIVE AYE AYE

02:26:45.196 --> 02:26:46.130
HAPPY TO DO IT BUT I BUT I'M I'M

02:26:46.197 --> 02:26:47.198
FROM I'M I'M THIS IS THIS

02:26:47.265 --> 02:26:47.565
SOMETHING THAT.

02:26:47.632 --> 02:26:48.266
BUBBLES UP ALL THE TIME WHEN YOU

02:26:48.332 --> 02:26:51.802
TALK TO FOLKS ON THE GROUND --

02:26:51.869 --> 02:26:52.403
AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN HOW

02:26:52.470 --> 02:26:55.039
HOW.

02:26:55.106 --> 02:26:55.673
HOW TO EASE THE TRANSITION AND I

02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:56.574
THINK WE CAN HELP WE DO A LOT OF

02:26:56.641 --> 02:26:58.376
GOOD FOR THESE KIDS?

02:26:58.442 --> 02:26:59.710
AND THEY'RE IN THEIR DISTRICT

02:26:59.777 --> 02:27:01.646
THE FOOD REALLY ADDRESS IT MORE

02:27:01.712 --> 02:27:04.982
FUNDAMENTALLY COMPREHENSIVELY.

02:27:05.049 --> 02:27:07.652
MAYBE YOU MAYBE YOU ADDRESS THIS

02:27:07.718 --> 02:27:10.721
YOU KNOW TRYING TO BALANCE --

02:27:10.788 --> 02:27:12.490
ALTERNATIVES AND WE TALK ABOUT

02:27:12.557 --> 02:27:14.692
EQUALIZING YOU KNOW FUNDING

02:27:14.759 --> 02:27:15.293
RATES AND THEN YOU TALK ABOUT

02:27:15.359 --> 02:27:17.995
THE DEDICATED FUNDING FOR

02:27:18.062 --> 02:27:19.697
PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN.

02:27:19.764 --> 02:27:21.032
WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE THE

02:27:21.098 --> 02:27:22.166
CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE SHOULD

02:27:22.233 --> 02:27:24.335
USE AND?

02:27:24.402 --> 02:27:25.603
IN TO THE EXTENT WE GET TO MAKE

02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:26.938
A DECISION IN MAKING THAT

02:27:27.004 --> 02:27:27.972
DECISION.

02:27:28.039 --> 02:27:31.809
AND IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION. FOR

02:27:31.876 --> 02:27:32.376
FOR SOMEBODY THAT KNEW THIS

02:27:32.443 --> 02:27:33.177
RODEO.

02:27:33.244 --> 02:27:35.680
I YEAH I THINK IT IS A FAIR

02:27:35.746 --> 02:27:40.384
QUESTION -- I THINK OUR OFFICES

02:27:40.451 --> 02:27:42.320
VIEWPOINT IS SOMEWHAT PECULIAR

02:27:42.386 --> 02:27:43.254
THAT WAS.

02:27:43.321 --> 02:27:45.289
THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE

02:27:45.356 --> 02:27:48.092
PRIMARY ISSUE -- WHEN YOU'RE

02:27:48.159 --> 02:27:50.328
YOU'RE THINKING THROUGH OPTIONS

02:27:50.394 --> 02:27:52.430
FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCES

02:27:52.496 --> 02:27:55.199
IS NOT ACTUALLY FUNDING FOR OUR

02:27:55.266 --> 02:27:56.634
SERVICES PROVIDED TO STUDENTS

02:27:56.701 --> 02:27:58.169
WITH DISABILITIES BUT IS THE

02:27:58.236 --> 02:27:59.270
FUNDING THAT'S?

02:27:59.337 --> 02:28:00.805
AVAILABLE FOR THE REST OF YOUR

02:28:00.871 --> 02:28:04.141
STUDENT POPULATION THAT'S ABOUT.

02:28:04.208 --> 02:28:06.577
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT

02:28:06.644 --> 02:28:08.312
LOCAL GENERAL PURPOSE?

02:28:08.379 --> 02:28:09.981
OF A SHARE OF THE SPECIAL

02:28:10.047 --> 02:28:12.183
EDUCATION.

02:28:12.250 --> 02:28:14.485
HI WHICH IS TO SAY THOSE DOLLARS

02:28:14.552 --> 02:28:16.687
WHICH ARE CURRENTLY BEING SPENT

02:28:16.754 --> 02:28:19.090
ON SPECIAL EDUCATION BUT WHICH

02:28:19.156 --> 02:28:20.925
ABSENT THE NEED FOR THOSE

02:28:20.992 --> 02:28:22.627
DOLLARS BECAUSE THERE'S INCREASE

02:28:22.693 --> 02:28:24.161
CATEGORICAL FUNDING.

02:28:24.228 --> 02:28:25.263
COULD BE SPENT ON ANY OTHER

02:28:25.329 --> 02:28:27.064
EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE HOW DO WE

02:28:27.131 --> 02:28:28.532
MAKE SURE THAT THAT BURDEN IS

02:28:28.599 --> 02:28:30.868
SHARED AS EQUITABLY ACROSS THE

02:28:30.935 --> 02:28:32.169
STATE AS POSSIBLE.

02:28:32.236 --> 02:28:33.804
NOW WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:28:33.871 --> 02:28:35.806
TWO OPTIONS THAT THE LA -- HAS

02:28:35.873 --> 02:28:38.476
LAID OUT OF EQUALIZATION AND

02:28:38.542 --> 02:28:39.710
PRESCHOOL FUNDING WHAT WE'RE

02:28:39.777 --> 02:28:42.013
SAYING AREN'T THERE ARE AT LEAST

02:28:42.079 --> 02:28:45.950
TWO POPULATIONS OF OF RULES WITH

02:28:46.017 --> 02:28:47.218
CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE

02:28:47.285 --> 02:28:48.986
BEING DISADVANTAGED BY THE

02:28:49.053 --> 02:28:50.354
STATE'S CURRENT.

02:28:50.421 --> 02:28:51.889
US SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING

02:28:51.956 --> 02:28:56.060
FORMULA FIRST THOSE THAT. FOR

02:28:56.127 --> 02:28:58.562
HISTORIC REASONS HAVE THESE.

02:28:58.629 --> 02:29:00.865
OF LOWER PURSUANT FUNDING RATES

02:29:00.931 --> 02:29:03.034
THEY THESE SCHOOLS WILL TEND TO

02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:04.335
BE CONTRIBUTING MORE OUT OF

02:29:04.402 --> 02:29:06.037
THEIR LCF TOWARD SPECIAL

02:29:06.103 --> 02:29:07.271
EDUCATION AND THUS HAVE FEWER

02:29:07.338 --> 02:29:10.274
pSIMILARLY SCHOOLS THAT ARE

02:29:10.341 --> 02:29:12.310
SERVING LARGE POPULATIONS OF

02:29:12.376 --> 02:29:13.077
THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS WITH

02:29:13.144 --> 02:29:15.279
DISABILITIES ARE SIMILARLY

02:29:15.346 --> 02:29:16.547
DISADVANTAGE THERE.

02:29:16.614 --> 02:29:17.882
DIVERTING WORE THEIR DOLLARS TO

02:29:17.948 --> 02:29:19.183
SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES THAT

02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:20.918
WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR

02:29:20.985 --> 02:29:23.688
OTHER EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES OF OF

02:29:23.754 --> 02:29:25.189
WHICH OF THOSE POPULATIONS YOU

02:29:25.256 --> 02:29:26.524
WOULD LIKE.

02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:29.293
TO PRIORITIZE GIVEN THE LIMITED

02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:31.228
FUNDING AVAILABLE THIS YEAR.

02:29:31.295 --> 02:29:33.798
I THINK THAT'S A TOUGH DECISION

02:29:33.864 --> 02:29:34.699
THAT'S THAT SAID.

02:29:34.765 --> 02:29:36.467
A ONE FOR LEGISLATORS BUT I

02:29:36.534 --> 02:29:38.703
THINK THERE'S A REASONABLE CASE

02:29:38.769 --> 02:29:40.338
TO BE MADE FOR EITHER.

02:29:40.404 --> 02:29:41.772
OR UNLESS THERE IS A UNLESS THE

02:29:41.839 --> 02:29:43.207
THE BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE TO

02:29:43.274 --> 02:29:45.776
COMBINE THE METHODS AND REDESIGN.

02:29:45.843 --> 02:29:47.745
THE TRIGGER POINT BASED ON THE

02:29:47.812 --> 02:29:50.614
IMPACT TO THE LOCAL CONTROL

02:29:50.681 --> 02:29:52.583
FUNDING FORMULA.

02:29:52.650 --> 02:29:55.152
IN MY MAKING SENSE YES I DO WELL

02:29:55.219 --> 02:29:56.987
IN THE SITUATION WHERE SOME

02:29:57.054 --> 02:30:00.358
SCHOOL DISTRICTS SOME ELLIE ETS

02:30:00.424 --> 02:30:02.026
OF HAVE OUR OUR HAVE A HIGHER

02:30:02.093 --> 02:30:03.594
IMPACT BECAUSE OF A HIGHER

02:30:03.661 --> 02:30:05.029
POPULATION OF THREE AND FOUR

02:30:05.096 --> 02:30:06.464
YEAR OLDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS.

02:30:06.530 --> 02:30:07.665
AND THEN THERE ARE OTHERS THAT

02:30:07.732 --> 02:30:08.933
DON'T HAVE THE THREE AND FOUR

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.634
YEAR OLDS BUT HAVE.

02:30:10.701 --> 02:30:11.969
ANOTHER POPULAR SPECIAL NEEDS

02:30:12.036 --> 02:30:13.537
POPULATION IT IMPACTS THE

02:30:13.604 --> 02:30:15.106
GENERAL FUND BECAUSE IT EXCEEDS

02:30:15.172 --> 02:30:16.907
THE THE MONEY WE OTHERWISE

02:30:16.974 --> 02:30:18.376
PROVIDE FOR SPECIAL NEEDS

02:30:18.442 --> 02:30:19.910
EDUCATION.

02:30:19.977 --> 02:30:21.645
AND SO MAYBE THE TRIGGER POINT

02:30:21.712 --> 02:30:24.982
NEEDS TO BE.

02:30:25.049 --> 02:30:26.751
BASED ON THE IMPACT TO THE THE

02:30:26.817 --> 02:30:28.219
GENERAL FUND.

02:30:28.285 --> 02:30:31.322
AS OPPOSED TO THE POPULATION OF

02:30:31.389 --> 02:30:33.257
SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS.

02:30:33.324 --> 02:30:35.126
SAID -- I DON'T BRAINSTORMING

02:30:35.192 --> 02:30:36.894
THAT YOU'RE ENGAGING IN I THINK

02:30:36.961 --> 02:30:39.864
IS VALUABLE AND I I KNOW THAT

02:30:39.930 --> 02:30:42.133
MADE THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE

02:30:42.199 --> 02:30:44.135
BEEN HAPPENING. FOR INSTANCE

02:30:44.201 --> 02:30:45.603
WITH CENTER ALLEN'S OFFICE AND

02:30:45.669 --> 02:30:48.539
WITH THE FOLKS AT THE TABLE.

02:30:48.606 --> 02:30:51.542
I IN SOME SENSE I I THINK THE

02:30:51.609 --> 02:30:52.543
EXTREME OF WHAT YOU'RE

02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:55.079
SUGGESTING IS THAT THE IDEAL.

02:30:55.146 --> 02:30:56.380
SYSTEM FOR FUNDING SPECIAL

02:30:56.447 --> 02:30:57.815
EDUCATION WOULD BE SOME KIND OF

02:30:57.882 --> 02:30:59.049
REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM IN SOME

02:30:59.116 --> 02:31:01.419
STATES LITERALLY TO FUND SPECIAL

02:31:01.485 --> 02:31:02.353
EDUCATION.

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:03.954
ON A REIMBURSEMENT THEY AS

02:31:04.021 --> 02:31:06.023
SCHOOLS SHOW US YOUR RECEIPTS

02:31:06.090 --> 02:31:08.759
SAN WILL GIVE YOU A CERTAIN --

02:31:08.826 --> 02:31:10.661
CHAIR OF THOSE COSTS THAT OF

02:31:10.728 --> 02:31:12.229
COURSE INVITES A LOT OF

02:31:12.296 --> 02:31:14.498
QUESTIONS WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO

02:31:14.565 --> 02:31:15.399
FULLY.

02:31:15.466 --> 02:31:16.600
GET INTO RIGHT NOW THEY'RE

02:31:16.667 --> 02:31:18.369
MOSTLY INVOLVING ADMINISTRATIVE

02:31:18.436 --> 02:31:20.704
COMPLEXITY AND THE POSSIBILITY

02:31:20.771 --> 02:31:22.873
THAT -- YOU MIGHT GAME THE

02:31:22.940 --> 02:31:25.309
SYSTEM SIMPLY ON PAPER BY.

02:31:25.376 --> 02:31:27.545
ASKING.

02:31:27.611 --> 02:31:30.414
OF WHAT DOES COUNT AS A SPECIAL

02:31:30.481 --> 02:31:32.583
EDUCATION EXPENSES OPPOSED TO

02:31:32.650 --> 02:31:33.884
GENERAL EDUCATION EXPENSE LET'S

02:31:33.951 --> 02:31:35.853
BE VERY TRICKY ISSUES TO WORK

02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:39.023
THROUGH BUT I I THINK IT IS A

02:31:39.089 --> 02:31:41.525
WORTHWHILE THOUGHT EXERCISE.

02:31:41.592 --> 02:31:45.496
OR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO IN ORDER

02:31:45.563 --> 02:31:47.398
TO EQUALIZE THE IMPACT TO THE

02:31:47.465 --> 02:31:47.731
NINE SPECIAL.

02:31:47.798 --> 02:31:49.266
ED FUNDED PIECE OF THE GENERAL

02:31:49.333 --> 02:31:50.501
FUND YOU HAVE TO SORT OF

02:31:50.568 --> 02:31:51.235
UNDERSTAND WHAT.

02:31:51.302 --> 02:31:52.636
HELP PEOPLE ARE SPENDING THEIR

02:31:52.703 --> 02:31:54.505
MONEY SO.

02:31:54.572 --> 02:31:56.540
THIS DISTRICT CAN GET MORE IN

02:31:56.607 --> 02:31:59.176
THIS DISTRICT CAN.

02:31:59.243 --> 02:32:01.145
YEAH AND ONE OF THE THINGS IT

02:32:01.212 --> 02:32:02.513
COMPLICATES ALL THIS IS THAT.

02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:04.915
I YOU KNOW THERE IS A

02:32:04.982 --> 02:32:07.651
PEDAGOGICAL AND LEGAL MOVEMENT

02:32:07.718 --> 02:32:09.220
TOWARD MAINSTREAM RATED AND

02:32:09.286 --> 02:32:10.721
HAVING EVERYBODY TOGETHER.

02:32:10.788 --> 02:32:12.523
AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS IT'S THE

02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:13.791
BEST THING TO DO FOR HIM IN MOST

02:32:13.858 --> 02:32:14.525
CASES.

02:32:14.592 --> 02:32:16.727
THAT REALLY DOES BLUR THE LINES

02:32:16.794 --> 02:32:19.497

THEN YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU HOW DO

02:32:32.276 --> 02:32:33.043
YOU CREATE A SYSTEM THAT REFER

02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:34.745
BACK TO THE REQUEST OF REFLECTS

02:32:34.812 --> 02:32:37.214

NON MADE YEAH.

02:32:38.682 --> 02:32:40.985
SEPARATING KIDS OUT INTO.

02:32:41.051 --> 02:32:43.287
THIS IS HOW WE GET INTO -- HEAD

02:32:43.354 --> 02:32:46.290
SPINNING CHALLENGES FASCINATING.

02:32:46.357 --> 02:32:48.626

I'M SO SORRY.

02:32:54.665 --> 02:32:55.699
ON THE EARLY CHILDHOOD THINK OUT

WHAT DO WE DO IN ON ON ON VERY

02:32:57.501 --> 02:32:59.470
EARLY SCREENING I MEAN WHAT IS

02:32:59.537 --> 02:33:00.337
THAT IS THAT I KNOW.

02:33:00.404 --> 02:33:02.039
IS THAT PART OF THE CALCULUS

02:33:02.106 --> 02:33:04.675
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT WITH YOUR

02:33:04.742 --> 02:33:06.477

02:33:06.544 --> 02:33:07.077
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FOR BETTER

02:33:07.144 --> 02:33:09.647

TERMS OF VERY EARLY SCREENINGS I

02:33:11.382 --> 02:33:13.250
THINK THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE

02:33:13.317 --> 02:33:14.418
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AROUND

02:33:14.485 --> 02:33:15.419
DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS AT A

YOUNGER AGE IS NOT NECESSARILY

02:33:17.021 --> 02:33:18.289
IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION BUDGET.

02:33:18.355 --> 02:33:19.590
BELIEVE IT'S MORE ON THE HEALTH

02:33:19.657 --> 02:33:21.292
AND HUMAN SERVICES SIDE BECAUSE

02:33:21.358 --> 02:33:22.126
THAT'S WHAT THE SCREENINGS ARE

02:33:22.192 --> 02:33:25.262
HAPPENING -- BUT YET THIS THIS

02:33:25.329 --> 02:33:26.964
PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT

02:33:27.031 --> 02:33:27.431
HAVE.

02:33:27.498 --> 02:33:29.466
IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH SCREENING

02:33:29.533 --> 02:33:35.940
AT EXTRA IF IF I I MADE BECAUSE

02:33:36.006 --> 02:33:37.174

AS THE SECRETARY FOR THE E.

03:15:14.969 --> 03:15:18.640
BOARD -- MY EXPERIENCE AS A

03:15:18.706 --> 03:15:19.908
SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY

03:15:19.974 --> 03:15:21.609
ASSISTANT IS GOING TO DIFFERENT

03:15:21.676 --> 03:15:23.778
SCHOOLS SITES AND SEEING THE

03:15:23.845 --> 03:15:26.081
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN -- AREAS

03:15:26.147 --> 03:15:27.715
LIKE THE WEST SIDE IN LOS

03:15:27.782 --> 03:15:30.518
ANGELES HAVING THE SUPPORT OF

03:15:30.585 --> 03:15:34.189
PARENTS WITH MONEY VERSES IN

03:15:34.255 --> 03:15:35.356
EAST LA ARE SOUTH CENTRAL WHERE

03:15:35.423 --> 03:15:37.225
PARENTS EVEN IF THEY WORK

03:15:37.292 --> 03:15:38.159
THIRTEEN HOURS A DAY.

03:15:38.226 --> 03:15:39.661
STILL CAN'T SUPPORT THE SCHOOL

03:15:39.727 --> 03:15:40.695
SITE.

03:15:40.762 --> 03:15:42.730
SO WHAT I'VE NOTICED IS THAT IN

03:15:42.797 --> 03:15:47.469
THE WEST SIDE -- THERE'S FUNDING.

03:15:47.535 --> 03:15:48.603
FOR YOU KNOW FOR WHATEVER THE

03:15:48.670 --> 03:15:49.104
SCHOOL NEEDS.

03:15:49.170 --> 03:15:53.441
AND THAT WAY KIDS ARE YOU KNOW

03:15:53.508 --> 03:15:54.742
WHO HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS CAN BE

03:15:54.809 --> 03:15:56.277
SUPPORTED.

03:15:56.344 --> 03:15:59.280
AND I'VE ALSO DONE --

03:15:59.347 --> 03:16:00.448
AUGMENTATIVE ALTERNATIVE

03:16:00.515 --> 03:16:02.417
COMMUNICATION WHERE I GO TO

03:16:02.484 --> 03:16:03.918
DIFFERENT SCHOOL SITES AND DROP

03:16:03.985 --> 03:16:06.588
OFF THE COMMUNICATION DEVICES OF

03:16:06.654 --> 03:16:08.423
STUDENTS WHO CAN'T TALK OR ARE

03:16:08.490 --> 03:16:10.792
PHYSICALLY DISABLED SO I'VE SEEN

03:16:10.859 --> 03:16:13.461
A DIFFERENT -- CENTERS THAT

03:16:13.528 --> 03:16:15.830
THESE KIDS WITH DISABILITIES GO

03:16:15.897 --> 03:16:18.299
AND THE LACK OF FUNDING MEANS

03:16:18.366 --> 03:16:20.168
THEY DON'T GET THE EQUIPMENT

03:16:20.235 --> 03:16:20.969
THEY NEED.

03:16:21.035 --> 03:16:22.871
AND THROUGH THEIR I EP THEY'RE

03:16:22.937 --> 03:16:24.305
SUPPOSED TO GET YOU KNOW THE

03:16:24.372 --> 03:16:24.739
SUPPORT [inaudible]

03:16:24.806 --> 03:16:27.509
AND IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

03:16:27.575 --> 03:16:29.944
FUNDING THEY FIND WAYS TO FIGURE

03:16:30.011 --> 03:16:32.213
OUT HOW TO SHORTEN THE AMOUNT OF

03:16:32.280 --> 03:16:33.882
SERVICES THAT THEY NEED.

03:16:33.948 --> 03:16:35.183
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE

03:16:35.250 --> 03:16:37.485
STUDENT AND THAT'S NOT GOOD.

03:16:37.552 --> 03:16:39.721
IF WE'RE WORKING TO TO HELP THE

03:16:39.787 --> 03:16:40.722
STUDENTS.

03:16:40.788 --> 03:16:42.223
AND IN REGARDS TO MEDICAL

03:16:42.290 --> 03:16:44.259
REIMBURSEMENTS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

03:16:46.294 --> 03:16:47.595
STUDENTS AS A SPEECH ASSISTANT.

03:16:47.662 --> 03:16:48.329
AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO

03:16:48.396 --> 03:16:49.964
DOCUMENT ALL THOSE STUDENTS ON

03:16:50.031 --> 03:16:51.933
WELL AGENT WHICH IS THE SOFTWARE

03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:53.334
THAT WE USE.

03:16:53.401 --> 03:16:54.969
AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO ALL OF

03:16:55.036 --> 03:16:56.304
THAT BY.

03:16:56.371 --> 03:16:57.138
TWO THIRTY AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

03:16:57.205 --> 03:16:58.907
TAKE OUR LUNCHES.

03:16:58.973 --> 03:17:00.708
AND OUR BREAKS IN BETWEEN THAT'S

03:17:00.775 --> 03:17:02.243
NOT ENOUGH TIME TO DOCUMENT ALL

03:17:02.310 --> 03:17:03.344
THOSE STUDENTS.

03:17:03.411 --> 03:17:05.079
AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS

03:17:05.146 --> 03:17:07.081
THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS A PROBLEM

03:17:07.148 --> 03:17:09.417
WITH A LACK OF FUNDING IS THAT

03:17:09.484 --> 03:17:10.852
WERE EXPECTED TO DO THE WORK IN

03:17:10.919 --> 03:17:12.387
A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.

03:17:12.453 --> 03:17:13.488
AND NOT PAY US FOR THE

03:17:13.555 --> 03:17:14.622

03:17:14.689 --> 03:17:17.292
DO.

03:17:17.358 --> 03:17:18.793
SO THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT.

03:17:18.860 --> 03:17:20.328
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO REALIZE THAT

03:17:20.395 --> 03:17:21.596
THE DISTRICTS THEY'RE DOING

03:17:21.663 --> 03:17:23.031

03:18:13.114 --> 03:18:14.015
MONEY TO HELP US SO THAT WE'RE

03:18:14.082 --> 03:18:14.649
NOT.

03:18:14.716 --> 03:18:15.450
ALLOWING THE NON PUBLIC AGENCIES

03:18:15.516 --> 03:18:20.388
TO CONTINUE BEHAVIORAL SO MANY

03:18:20.455 --> 03:18:21.389
