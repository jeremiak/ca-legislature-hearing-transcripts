THANKING SEE FOR A FOR HOSTING ANOTHER ONE OF OUR COMMITTEE HERE HERE IS AT YOUR ANNUAL CONFERENCE -- AND WHEN FOLKS SAID FOLKS AS TO WHY YOU DOING HEARING THE DAY AFTER ELECTION MICHAEL C. FORAYS MEETING IN THE ROAD I DO HERE AND WE NEED TO DO IT. WAS THE FOR A BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY ARE DOING THE WORK ARE GOING TO BE -- AND SO WE WERE JUST HERE LAST YEAR DISCUSS THE IMPACT OF FEDERAL CUTS ON CALIFORNIA SENIORS WERE STILL REMAINS A SERIOUS CONCERN. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE TALKING MAKING CHANGES. TO MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY -- AND WE THINK ABOUT THE LAST -- THIS LAST SESSION THE LAST ALMOST TWO YEARS -- IT'S BEEN. ELDERLY WITH DISABILITIES COMMUNITIES AND OUR CARE GIVER COMMUNITIES. AND WE DON'T REALLY HAVE. A SYSTEM IN PLACE. THAT UNDERSTANDS THE SENSITIVITIES OF THIS COMMUNITY IS A COMMUNITY THAT IS GROWING. IT IS A COMMUNITY THAT IS DEALING WITH UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN HONEST ENOUGH TO ADDRESS IN THE PAST. AND IT IS A COMMUNITY THAT IS CHANGING. AND WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT HOW WE CULTURALLY CARE FOR ALL KINDS OF ELDERS. WE HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT AN HOUR SUPPORTING OUR CARE GIVER COMMUNITY. WE HAVE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE WE ARE PUTTING. OUR SENIORS AND MAKING SURE THAT THE PLACES THAT WE ARE PUTTING THEM ARE SAFE. AND THAT THEY ARE PLACES THAT WE CAN AFFORD. THERE IS NO MORE UNDIGNIFIED WAY TO AGE THEN BE FORCED TO POVERT. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GETTING THERE THAT YOU DESERVE. SO I AM THANKFUL FOR ALL OF YOU ALL FOR CONTINUE COME OUT AND TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND YOUR TESTIMONY. YOUR EXPERIENCES PRACTITIONERS WILL CONTINUE TO GUIDE AND INFORM THIS COMMITTEE AND I KNOW WILL CONTINUE TO EMPOWER OUR CHAIR AS DO THIS IMPORTANT WORK SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AT THE YOU SEE WHY I AM SO EXCITED TO HAVE HER -- COMPASSIONATE LEADERSHIP AS PART OF OUR THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING IS. TO REIMAGINE THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACTON AND LOOK AT WAYS IT SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO TRULY REFLECT ALL THE SERVICES CALIFORNIA SENIORS TRULY NEED. AS WE EXPLORE WAYS PROVIDE BETTER COORDINATE THOSE SERVICE. ENACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO OH CA. AUTHORIZED CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC PROGRAM HAVING OLDER ADULTS IN THEIR HOMES COMMUNITY. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY VILLAGES AS AMENDED THOSE HERE SEVERAL TIMES REFLECT THE CHANGE IN POPULATION AND AGING SERVICE DELIVERY NEEDS. WE'LL HEAR ABOUT IN GREATER DETAIL FROM OUR PANEL. I THINK WE CAN ALL WITH THE CURRENT LEVEL SERVICES FOR SENIORS -- AS AS JUST REFERRED TO BY THE SUMMER CATALOGUE OF A IS AN INADEQUATE. AND THAT THE STATE BIRDS ARE NOT WELL DIRECTED. NOT AS WELL DIRECTOR RECORDED AS THEY COULD BE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE THE DIVERSE GROUP OF OF LOCAL. THE FOLKS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GREATER NATION -- IT IS CALIFORNIANS ACT IN A WAY THAT REFLECTS OUR CURRENT REALITIES AND THAT WE DO IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE RAPIDLY AGING POPULATION. WHILE ENSURING THAT OUR SENIORS GET ALL THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED AND DESERVE IT SO I THINK ABOUT THOSE ARE GOALS THAT. I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM HAS BEEN WORKING ON AND FOR MANY YEARS IN THEIR OWN WAY AND I THINK THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE REALLY SEEN -- THE THE WORK OF BOTH FROM THE STATE START WORKING WITH MY WOR- COORDINATION AT A AND BETTER STRATEGY ANOTHER AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN CERTAINLY BUILD UPON. AND SO -- WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED IS THE THIS IS GOING TO GO -- IN TILL NOON -- AND SO WE CAN I GET A LOT OF INFORMATION. OVER THE NEXT HOUR OR SO. AND SOME BRAKE SIDE ABOUT THAT AND TO START OFF THIS IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT. SPEAK ON HISTORIC OVERVIEW. AND I'M VERY EXCITED TO IT AND TO TO HAVE WITH US LARA CONNELLY THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA BOARD DEPARTMENT OF AGING IS BEEN. A WONDERFUL PARTNER IS SOMEONE I KNOW THAT IS COMMITTED. TO THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN TERMS OF FIGURE OUT WHAT THE NEXT STEPS OFF A NEW GOVERNOR COMING AND WHAT HAVE YOU WHAT CAN WE DO NOW. IN PREPARING FOR THE MONTHS AHEAD AND REALLY FOR THE YEARS AHEAD AS WE LOOK AT THE NEEDS ARE GREAT SO I PRESS LIKE PAST RECTOR CONNELLY -- IF SHE COULD -- BUT MADE FROM THE PODIUM -- AS TO HER PERSPECTIVES -- THAT WE BEGIN THE HEARING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY I HAVE BEEN TASKED WITH A VERY VERY VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF IN FACT -- THIS WILL PROBABLY HISTORICALLY BE THE FASTEST OVERVIEW THE OLDER CALIFORNIA'S ACT YOU'VE. EVER SEEN BUT JUST TO LAY THE CONTEXT FOR THE DISCUSSION TODA- AND FIVE I WILL JUST -- KEEP THIS AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL. AND THERE AND I HAVE SLIDES SO MY THE BEST AT THAT. TIME. THAT. ROUTE MICROPHONE MOVE AROUND IF THERE'S A MORE CONVENIENT PLACE FOR YOU TO STAND OR SIT. I NEED TO BE THERE [INAUDIBLE] WELL. RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S AN SENIOR CAN HAVE SO IT'S NOT THE SOMEBODY FOR THE LAPTOP WITH. THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT REALLY NEEDS SEEN IN CONTEXT OF THE FEDERAL OLD AMERICAN SOUTH AND SO LET ME JUST REALLY REALLY BRIEFLY SPEAK TO THAT. THE FEDERAL OLDER AMERICANS ACT- THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED INITIALLY IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE DEFINES THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL RULES FOR ADMINISTERING THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. ESTABLISHES THOSE OLDER AMERICANS ACT SERVICES THERE FUNDING FORMULAS AND THE MATCH REQUIREMENTS THAT STATES NEED -- TO MEET AND THEN IT ALSO SPECIFIED A TARGET POPULATIONS AND DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT THE STATE'S MUST COMPLY WITH. 75% OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING OLDER AMERICANS ACT FUNDING COMES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THEN WE HAVE A 25% MATCH THAT THE STATE CHIPS AND FROM GENERAL FUND. THE OLDER CALIFORNIA'S ACT THEN IS THAT STATE COMPLEMENT TO THE FEDERAL HOLD AMERICANS ACT -- IT SPECIFIES. AGING IS THE DESIGNATED STATE UNIT ON AGING -- TO RECEIVE THAT HE'S FEDERAL FUNDS. IT DEFINES THE RULES FOR THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE ADVISORIES COMMITTEES ALL OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND THERE'S OF ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. IT ALSO SPECIFIES PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING INCLUDING THAT OF THE CHURCH COUNSELING AN ADVOCACY PROGRAM AND ALL JUST CAUGHT HIGH CAP. ON MULTIPURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM EMESIS P. AND THOSE FOR PROGRAMS THAT WERE AND ADDITIONALLY OUTSIDE OF BILL THERE OUTSIDE OF THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT -- THERE NOW PART OF THE BUT EMPHASIS P. IS IS OUR STATE K. PROGRAM. ONE OF OUR STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS. AND THEN THE ON THAT JUST SOME SERVICE SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS OUT. IT ESTABLISHES SPECIFIC -- TARGETING FORMULA. FOR ALLOCATING THE ERROR AGENCIES ON AGING THE THE BASE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING THAT COMES TO US SO THAT THOSE DOLLARS THE CAME TO COME TO US FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HOW WE ALLOCATE THEM HERE -- WITHIN THE STATE. IT REQUIRES THAT THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM PERFORM ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES ABOVE AND BEYOND THOSE THAT ARE IN THE FEDERAL -- PROGRAM. AND IN. NINETEEN NINETY SIX ASSEMBLY BILL TO TALK -- TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED AS IT IS. REFER TO TRANSFER THE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM ANTI CAP. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING WE ORIGINALLY OPERATED IT DIRECTLY DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL A TRANSFER THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT ALSO ESTABLISH TO COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES ARE PROGRAM SINCE SHOULD JOBS. THAT ARE NOT IN THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT -- AND THAT WAS A WIDE ARRAY OF COMMUNITY SERVICES THEY ARE STILL ON THE BOOKS. MOST OF THEM LOST THEIR FUNDING DURING THE WE'VE A COLUMN THAT THE BAD YEARS -- BUT THEY STILL REMAIN. IN THE STATUTE. I NEXT HAVE A VERY NICE LIGHT OF THE THREE THREE THREE EIGHT EIGHT AND EACH. EACH AGENCY HAS OF IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING AND SERVICE AREA. OKAY SOME OF YOU HAVE THAT. GREAT PERFECT. THERE REALLY BEAUTIFUL IN COLOR. SO SOME AGENCIES EARLY IN THE LARGER AREAS OF THE STATE LARGER COUNTIES HAVE US ARE A SINGLE -- COUNTY AREA AGENCY ON AGING AND MORE RURAL AREAS THEY'RE MAYBE SURVEY MULTIPLE COUNTIES -- BUT THOSE OF THE PLANNING AND SERVICE AREAS. AND THEN REAL BRIEFLY JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE KEY PROGRAMS AND SERVICES WHICH I KNOW MR CARRIER CERTAINLY FAMILIAR WITH -- HUNDRED THAT ARE THAT ARE DEFINED UNDER THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY -- IN THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT AS WELL AMPLE INFORMATION REFERRAL. NUTRITION PROGRAMS PROBABLY THE MOST WELL KNOWN OF OUR SERVICES AND THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE. LEGAL SERVICES. OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND THOSE SERVICES CAN BE VERY BROAD RANGING FROM CARE COORDINATION CHORE ASSISTANCE HOME MODIFICATIONS TRANSPORTATION SENIOR CENTERS WHATEVER YOU CAN SQUEEZE INTO THAT MORE LIMITED - FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE. HEALTH PROMOTION AND DISEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS. CAREGIVER SUPPORT SERVICES IS ONE OF THE NEWER -- AMERICANS ACT SERVICES. AND AND AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. AND IN CALIFORNIA THE THE THREE AREAS THAT THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT IS NOT NATIONWIDE. IS -- CONDUCTING COMMUNITY EDUCATION ABOUT LONG TERM SERVICES IN ISSUES RECEIVING AND INVESTIGATING. TO DIFFUSE AND THE COLLECT. CARE FACILITIES AND THEN WHAT BURDEN. TRANSFERS -- EXCEPT. BY NURSING HOME RESIDENTS. A MUCH BROADER ROLE AND I THINK- CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF ADDITIONS THAT YOU'LL SEE OVER THE YEARS IF YOU WERE JUST GOING THROUGH THE ACT TO THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT. A NUMBER INSURANCE COUNSELING PROGRAM WHICH I MENTIONED -- EARLIER ACTUALLY BEGAN IN CALIFORNIA AND BECAME A NATIONAL PROGRAMS BECAUSE THE OTHER WAY AROUND -- AND THEN THE SENIOR COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM. IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE FEDERAL PROGRAMS THAT SEVENTY PARK AGENCIES ALSO ADMINISTER. THE MULTI PURPOSE IN SERVICES PROGRAM WHICH IS A MEDICAL PROGRAM -- HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED -- PROGRAM FOR OLDER ADULTS WHO ARE NURSING HOME ELIGIBLE BUT WITH ADDITIONAL SERVICES -- COULD SAFELY REMAIN AT HOME IS ALSO IN THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT -- IT'S A LONG STANDING PROGRAM WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. THE ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. NOW REFER AT SEA BASS A COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES. WE OPERATE THROUGH AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT WITH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUT IT IS NOT IN THE OLDER CALIFORNIA'S ACTS SO IT IS IT IS OUTSIDE OF THAT. AT THIS POINT. AND I THINK TO IS TO REALLY END WITH KIND OF THE MOST RECENT CHANGES -- TO THE ACT YEAH -- MOST RECENTLY IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CENTER IS FOR IDENTIFIED AND DEFINED IN THE ACT AS BEING AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE -- THAT INITIATIVE COMING TO THE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN. A REHABILITATION IS THE CORE STATE PROP PARTNERS -- ALSO IN TWO THOUSAND SIX IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AGAIN SPECIFYING THAT ALL OLDER ADULTS HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS AN OLDER CONFERENCE ACT PROGRAMS. AND ADDED LGBT OLDER ADULTS TO THE EXISTING SUBGROUP OF AT GREATEST -- SOCIAL NEED AND TARGETING PROGRAM SERVICES AND THAT WAS JUST -- LEGISLATION PASSED THIS YEAR. AND MOST RECENTLY HAVE ALSO WERE DRESSED AS I AS I MENTIONED KIND OF SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT HAVE. COME UP FOR THE OLDER OF FOR THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRA. IN TERMS OF ACCESS -- TO TO FACILITY THAN BEING ABLE TO SERVE THE RESIDENTS THERE. THE FINAL SLIDE IS JUST A REAL QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE COMMISSION ON AGING I THINK PEOPLE THAT THEIR SOMETIMES CONFUSION AS TO ARE THEY IN OUR DEPARTMENT NOT NOT IN OUR DEPARTMENT. THEY'RE IN THE SAME BUILDING THAT WORK IN THERE DOWNSTAIRS OR UPSTAIRS -- WE DO HAVE A CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIPS AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT -- BUT THE PURPOSE OF THE COMMISSION IS TO SERVICE THE PRINCIPLE ADVOCATE BODY IN THE STATE ON BEHALF OF OLDER INDIVIDUALS THEY ARE COMPLETELY SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM THE DEPARTMENT -- AND THE ACT THE OLDER CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS OF VICE OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE COMMISSION AND THE APPOINTMENT PROCESS -- AND IDENTIFIES THEIR DUTIES AND FOR BUT THIS CONFERENCE IS EARLIER THIS YEAR THAN IT NORMALLY IS A NEIGHBOR A SCHEDULE TO ME ELSEWHERE. AND THEN -- I CONCLUDE WITH SOME. REFERENCES TO OTHER RESOURCES THAT OUR WEBSITE. THANK YOU SO MUCH STRICTER DAY DO IT YES IS A GREAT JOB AND ONE QUESTION YOU YOUR OF EARLY ON MATCH THAT 75% OF FUNDING FEDERAL 25% -- STATE MATCH WHAT IT ROUGHLY WHAT IS THAT AMOUNT I DON'T RECALL THE TOP MY WHO WHO THINK ROUGHL. OKAY RING ABOUT THAT. IT WAS YOU GO DO A GOOGLE SEARCH TO GET BACK IN THERE. ARE. YOU KNOW OUR BUDGET IS A PORTION OF MEDI CAL I MEAN WE BREAK OUT IT'S A VERY IS COMPLIANCE BUT I WILL GET GAP THANK YOU. THANK YOU DIRECTOR AND THEN -- UP NEXT AGAIN TO GET TO ADD ON TO THIS -- THE CONTACTS IN THE HISTORICAL OVERVIEW -- SAYS ASTAIRE SIR ASTON HOW ISN'T SENIOR POLICY ADVISER WITH THE SCAN FOUNDATION I REALLY WANT TO THANK THE SCANNED FOUNDATION IS BEEN SUCH AN INCREDIBLE PARTNER OF LAST COUPLE YEARS AS WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MOVE. THE BALL FORWARD ON ON ISSUES OF AGING THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON ASSEMBLY MEMBER COM LUDWIG. IT'S CERTAINLY AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO SPEAK WITH YO- I AM THIRSTY HOUSE AND AND I AM SENIOR POLICY ADVISER AT THE SKIN FOUNDATION OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT IN RELATION TO OUR BROADER SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. SOME OF OUR SYSTEM CHALLENGES FEDERAL STRUCTURAL ISSUES AND EMERGING POLICY CONSIDERATIONS. SO ALL STAR WITH THE CHALLENGE IT'S WIDELY KNOWN THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLE TO ACCESS THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED. TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY AND INDEPENDENCE BUT THE PROBLEM REALLY IS MULTI FACETED AS YOU BOTH ALLUDED TO IT STEMS FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING SYSTEM FRAGMENTATION. LACK OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE AND AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS ULTIMATELY UNABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH POPULATION NEAT. SO ALL IN THE MEANTIME CALIFORNIA'S OLDER POPULATION IS GROWING AS WE ALL KNOW IT'S NOT ONLY GROWING IT'S BECOMING MORE UNIQUE AND DIVERSE. WHICH IS ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE DEVELOP A SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT STRENGTHENED TO MEET OUR POPULATION NEED NOT ONLY NOW. BUT INTO THE FUTURE. SO WHY DO WE FACE THESE CHALLENGES -- WILL REALLY THE SYSTEM IS OF ALL KIND OF AS REALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS ALL OF WHICH LARA OUTLINED AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS. ALL THESE REALLY CRITICAL PROGRAMS HAVE KIND OF INVOLVED AS THE PATCHWORK -- ACROSS DEPARTMENTS WITH DIFFERENT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS -- IN ALL OF THIS ULTIMATELY MAKES IT REALLY HARD FOR CONSUMERS TO ACCESS THE SUPER SERVICES AND SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED IN A COORDINATED. STREAMLINED FASHION. SO MORE AND MORE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT THE SYSTEM IS BEGINNING TO EVOLVE TOWARDS ONE THAT NOT ONLY LOOKS AT IN INDIVIDUALS AGE BUT IN INDIVIDUALS FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY- AS A CONDITION OF ELIGIBILITY SO BASICALLY WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE OF ALL AGES WHO NEED LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS- NEED SIMILAR TYPES OF SERVICES ACROSS THE LIFESPAN NOW THIS ISN'T TO SAY THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES ACROSS POPULATIONS. THING UNIQUE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS SAY SOMEBODY WHO IS LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S -- AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY ARE VERY UNIQUE IN COMPARISON TO SAY A WORKING PERSON WITH DISABILITY WHO'S THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY YEARS OLD. BUT THE TYPES OF SERVICE CARE CARE COORDINATION DEPENDING ON THEIR SITUATION ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION AND MOBILITY IN THE COMMUNITY. THEY ARE SIMILAR ACROSS THE LIFESPAN SO WE SEE THE UNIQUE APPROACHES WE ALSO SEE THAT THESE POPULATION POPULATIONS USE MANY OF THE SAME SERVICES ACROSS THE SYSTEM. SO WE'RE SEEING A BIT OF A PARADIGM SHIFT -- THERE'S AN EVOLUTION THAT AS A SITE IS LOOKING AT FUNCTIONAL NEED AS OPPOSED TO JUST AGE AND THIS IS ROOTED THIS CHANGE IS ROOTED IN A NUMBER OF FACTORS ONE OF WHICH BEGAN WITH. THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HOMESTEAD DECISION WHICH IN. NINETEEN NINETY NINE FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF AGE HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE MOST HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SETTING POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO THEIR NEEDS AND PREFERENCES OF COURSE NOT EVERYBODY CAN ALWAYS LIVE IN THE HOME AND THE COMMUNITY. BUT BASICALLY THE SUPREME COURT SAID IT'S THEIR RIGHT TO LIVE IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING SO THIS JUST STARTED TO SET A STANDARD FOR LOOKING IT NEEDS. ACROSS THE LIFESPAN IN A MORE COORDINATED FASHION -- AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE HAVE SEEN THIS SHIFT IN HOW THEY ORGANIZE PROGRAMS -- IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ESTABLISHED THE ADMINISTRATION FOR COMMUNITY LIVING -- THIS BROUGHT TOGETHER THE ADMINISTRATION ON AGING WITH AS DIRECTOR CONNELLY REFERENCED OVERSEAS THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS BUT IT ALSO BROUGHT TOGETHER THE FEDERAL OFFICE ON DISABILITY. AND ADMINISTRATION ON INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND THIS ADMINISTRATION FOR GOOD POINT OF COORDINATING POLICY DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL ACROSS THE LIFESPAN WITH THE GOAL THAT ALL ARE ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WANNA LIVE WITH DIGNITY. AND INDEPENDENCE -- SO WITH THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT THERE REALLY IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE IT IN LIGHT OF OUR CHANGING SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. OZ'S REFERENCED -- WHEN THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT WAS ESTABLISHED IN? NINETEEN EIGHTY IT'S BEEN AMENDED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN ALL WITH VERY IMPORTANT CHANGES AND ADDITIONS TO IT. ON BUT IT'S NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT TODAY IT DOES CONTAIN SOME SECTIONS THAT COULD USE SOME UPDATING. AS WELL AS THERE'S NOT MANY PROGRAMS AND WHO THAT RECEIVE NO GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. AND MANY OF SOME HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO TO LACK OF RESOURCES. SO IF YOU STEP BACK THEN AND YOU LOOK ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENTS IF YOU LOOK AT DEPARTMENT OF AGING DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ALL OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS PROVIDE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT OLDER ADULTS NEED. OKAY BUT AGAIN WITH VARYING ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND THE CHALLENGE IS THAT THERE'S NO OVER ARCHING LEADERSHIP STRATEGY ACROSS AS DEPARTMENTS FOCUSED SOLELY ON THE GOAL OF HELPING PEOPLE LIVE WITH DIGNITY. INDEPENDENCE AND SETTING OF THEIR CHOICE SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS A COORDINATED BUDGET POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND SYSTEM PLANNING ACROSS THE DEPARTMENTS. AREN'T SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN ULTIMATELY IT'S THE INDIVIDUALS THE OLDER ADULTS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE STRUGGLING STILL ACCESS SERVICES. IN A COORDINATED AND DIGNIFIED FASHION. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CALLS FOR CHANGE IF THIS WERE EASY TO DO I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE ALREADY WE'VE HAD REPORTS FROM THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. BOTH THE THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON AGING AND THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON AGING. HAVE PUT OUT REPORTS FOR CHANGE BUT UNFORTUNATELY -- NONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE ULTIMATELY COME TO FRUITION SO TODAY THERE'S A REALLY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER HOW TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES AND MODERN MODERNIZE THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT TO REFLECT THE NEEDS OF TODAY'S POPULATION. PEOPLE WHO ALL DESIRE THE SAME THING TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY AND INDEPENDENCE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR OF I THINK THAT -- YOU AND DIRECTOR CONNELLY. THE FOUNDATION FOR THE CONVERSATION AND AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA HERE. IN THE NEXT HOUR OR SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOOK FOURTEEN OR IF YOU -- AND SO. WE HAVE A COUPLE PANELS AND A LOT OF REALLY GREAT MINDS THAT ARE GONNA BE -- EXPRESSES SOME OF THEIR THOUGHTS AND ANYONE OF THE COULD PROBABLY TAKE THE MIKE FOR THE NEXT HOUR BUT I'M ASKING EACH OF THEM -- TO TAKE THE MIKE FOUR MINUTES SELECT. IF -- IF I CAN I'M GONNA A CALL UP THE FIRST PANEL AND YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE A SEAT. AT THE TABLE -- I THINK WE MANY ONE EXTRA SEE THROUGHOUT THIS FIVE YEAH WILL GIVE A MORE SEED. AND A REIMAGINE ALL CALIFORNIANS I CHANGE THE PARADIGM TO SERVICE DELIVERY PANEL -- WE HAVE -- VICTORIA JUMP THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF YEAH AGENCIES ON AGING -- CLAY CAN'T LEGISLATIVE CULTURE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. NICOLE HOW EXACTLY DIRECTOR FOR OMBUDSMAN SERVICES A CONTRA COSTA. AND SOLANO -- COUNTIES CALIFORNIA ELDER JUSTICE COALITION -- TOUCH ON A FAST SO CONSULTANT FOR CALIFORNIA HEALTH ADVOCATES. AND EILEEN CRUISE DIRECTOR OF SENIOR CARE SO ONE IS ASK FOR A THREE OR FOUR MINUTE REFLECTION- ON THIS TOPIC AND TO KIND OF AGAIN -- THIS ENTIRE HEARING REALLY AS WE KNOW FROM THE HEARINGS LAST YEAR IS A SET THE STAGE ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN THE YEAR AHEAD LEGISLATION BUDGET WISE. AND SO THE REFUND YOUR REFLECTIONS ARE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE -- AT THIS TIME SO [INAUDIBLE] OKAY. QUICK ANSWER YES. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN OF WE RAN OUT OF THE GYM THIS AND EVERYBODY'S AT ABOUT ONE SO WE HAVE A SOLUTION. WE HAVE A MOBILE APP. PLATFORM AS PART OF OUR CONFERENCE. THE AGENDA IS ON THAT.

AND GET THE EDGE AND IT'S ACTUALLY YOU KNOW A GOOD SIGN RENDON AGENDAS IS LIKE WELL ATTENDED HEARING AND I'M VERY GLAD. THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN SO -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A MOVE ON TO DIRECTOR VICTORIA JUMP. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA- FOR THE RECORD I'M VICTORIA JUMP AND I'M ACTUALLY THE DIRECTOR OF THE INTER COUNTY AREA AGENCY ON AGING WE HAVEN'T FIRED TERREL AND REPLACE. WE DON'T WANT RUMORS -- FROM THE AREA AGENCY ON AGING PERSPECTIVE ALTHOUGH GREAT IN CONCEPT AT THE TIME -- THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT REALLY NO LONGER NECESSARILY WORKS FOR US SEVERAL PARTS OF IT WERE DE FUNDED YEARS AGO -- IN STATUTE BUT NOT IN PLACE AND THOSE WERE CRITICAL SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE NEEDED. PEOPLE -- STRUGGLE TO ACCESS SERVICES STILL -- AND THE SILOS AND ALL OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S AND WHERE THINGS ARE HOUSE AND WHERE THEY'RE FUNDED. REALLY DON'T WORK WITH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO COME THROUGH THE SYSTEM NOW - SO ARE A SO FREE ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING WE'RE ACTUALLY. CLOSING A SOLUTION TO PART OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT'S TO MIRROR WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE LOWER LEVEL -- TAKE AGING AND DISABILITY AND COMBINE THEM TAKE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND ACTUALLY REIMAGINE BUT IT CAN BE AN EXPAND WHAT IT CAN BE AND CREATE A DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY LIVIN- WE DO WANT A MORE EFFICIENT DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT REALLY STRENGTHENS ACCESS TO HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES -- SO THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN AGE AND LIVE WITH DIGNITY AND INDEPENDENCE AND WE'RE ALSO SAYING RATHER THAN ADD NEW PROGRAMS TO THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT. REALLY JUST CREATE THAT AS A FIRST STEP. THE DEPARTMENT OF FOR YOU KNOW COMMUNITY LIVING -- WE WOULD ALSO ASK THAT THAT NEW DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW BE THE MECHANISM TO STREAMLINING COORDINATE STATEWIDE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THAT WE THAT WE NEED. WE WOULD LIKE THIS NEW DEPARTMENT. MIRRORING WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE PROGRAMS THAT FALL. UNDER ITS JURISDICTION WILL ALSO ADVOCATING ACROSS STATE DEPARTMENTS FOR THE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. TO THIS SEND THIS NEW DEPARTMENT WOULD PROMOTE COORDINATED POLICY DEVELOPMENT WITH HOUSING HEALTH CARE. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TRANSPORTATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND OTHERS AND SUPPORTING INTEGRATED SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM RIGHT NOW THIS IS NOT HAPPENING EVERYTHING IS SEEN AS YOU KNOW SEPARATE SILO. I'M RIGHT THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE SO MANY. PEOPLE COMING INTO OUR SYSTEMS THAT WE NEED WHICH WERE ALSO ASKING THAT OR PROPOSING THAT UNDER THIS NEW STRUCTURE THAT WE REALLY LOOK AT WHAT. ALREADY EXISTS WHICH IS -- THE AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTIONS AND TURN THEM INTO NO WRONG DOOR ACCESS FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES WITH DISABILITIES. AND OTHER ADULTS AS WELL TO GET THEIR SERVICES. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT HIM SERRA MENTIONED EARLIER THAT OUR HOUSE WITH IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND MORE. WE'RE PROPOSING THAT YOU KNOW TO CHANGE THAT. NEW DEPARTMENT BRING OTHER PROGRAMS ARE HOUSE UNDER. STATE AGENCIES THAT AFFECT THIS POPULATION AND HOUSE THEM UNDER. ONE UNDER ONE ROOF -- WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU CHANGE THE LOCAL THE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT'S INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED BUT AT LEAST START AT THE STATE LEVEL AND CONSIDER. TAKING PROGRAMS LIKE SOME OF THE WAIVER PROGRAMS AND COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES WAIVER. THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER MOVE THEM FROM DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO A NEW DEPARTMENT -- TAKE OLDER ADULTS. THAT ARE BORN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF REHAB ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY MOVE THEM OVER. TO AGING OR NOT TO AGING THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY LIVING - SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A MORE. YOU KNOW COORDINATED SYSTEM AT LEAST YOU KNOW A STARTING POINT TO HOW WE ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS AND THIS COULD BE THE START OF A POTENTIAL YOU KNOW. THE FIRST STEP IN A MASTER PLAN OF HOW WE'RE GOING. TO IMPACTS SERVICE DELIVERY. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A BOLD SUGGESTIONS IN THREE MINUTES AND FORTY FIVE SECONDS DONE THAT'S GREAT. BUT THANK GOD THANK YOU. NO THANK YOU VICTORIA AND AND THIS IS PASSED MICROPHONE DOWN. EVERYONE CONSULTING OR DO THINK WE'RE A LITTLE BIT OUT OF THE ORDER IN THE AGENDA BUT THAT'S OKAY PRETTY WILL. OKAY HI MY NAME IS TATIANA FIRST YEAR AND I WEAR MANY HATS TODAY I AM A CONSULTANT FOR CALIFORNIA HEALTH ADVOCATES FORMALLY -- THE BOARD CHAIR I AM ALSO AN OUTREACH COORDINATOR FOR THE HIGH CAP PROGRAM IN PSA THREE PASSAGES. AND I AM A CARE GIVER. AND I AM A MEDICARE BENEFICIARY. SO FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE I'VE BEEN A SPEAK. WITH HIGH CAP EVER SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THE TOTAL NEED FOR HAVING COORDINATION OF CARE BOTH FROM A A USER A CARE GIVER. AND ALSO AN EDUCATOR MEDICARE BENEFITS -- THE HIGH CAP PROGRAM WHICH IS PART OF A NATIONAL SYSTEM OF STATE HEALTH INSURANCE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. IS A COMBINATION OF FEDERAL AND STATE DOLLARS. AND WE SERVE. PEOPLE ANYBODY THEY ARE YOUNGER DISABLED WITH THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED AND THEY BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE DO YOU TO ONE OF THEIR PARENTS BECOMING ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. SO OUR SERVICES IN THE HIGH CAP PROGRAM AND WHAT WE SUPPORT AS CALIFORNIA HEALTH ADVOCATES IS THE EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY THAT. OUR IS REQUIRED. OF UNDER THE SHIP GRANT. AND ON A LOCAL BASIS MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES NEED TO KNOW WHERE THEY CAN'T GET HELP. SPECIALLY NOW WITH THE CHANGING ENVIRONMENT OF MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS THE PART D. PLANS WE ARE. I'VE BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM OPEN ENROLLMENT WORK. AT AT LEAST TWO PRESENTATIONS A DAY IN FIVE COUNTIES -- TO A COP MY IDEAL WAY OF OF WHEN HIGH CAP WAS MOVED AS A RESULT OF AB. TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED AND EVERY PSA HAS THE OPTION OF HAVING EITHER A DIRECT SERVICE MODEL OR A SUBCONTRACTED MODEL. I HAPPEN TO BE BIAS ON THE DIRECT SERVICE BECAUSE THAT IS I GREW UP IN HIGH CAP WITH PSA THREE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND IT IS AN INTEGRATED. IN MISSISSIPPI CARE GIVER SUPPORT PROGRAM THE ON EVERYBODY IS TOGETHER AND ALL I HAVE TO DO IS IF I SEE A CLIENT OVER COUNSELORS SEE A CLIENT OR A CARE GIVER THAT HAS MULTIPLE ISSUES WE CAN. IT'S LIKE NO WRONG DOOR. AND THAT IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT SYSTEM OF COORDINATED CARE. AS A CONSULTANT -- TO CALIFORNIA HEALTH ADVOCATES I HAVE SPOKEN TO MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT HIGH CAP. AND DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE BENEFITS THAT PROGRAM WITHIN BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW. AND WE HAVE TO EDUCATE THEM SO HAVING A SYSTEM OF COORDINATED ACCESS FOR ALL OF THEIR NEEDS MY MOTHER NOW IS EXPERIENCING SEVERE -- COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND I LOVE FOUR HUNDRED MILES AWAY. MY BROTHERS LIVE LOCALLY BUT THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T GET INVOLVED IN THAT ASPECT SO YOU SHE KNOWS WHERE THEY GO FOR THE ANSWERS AND SO DID THIS ALL MY COMMUNITY KNOW WHERE TO GO. TO FOR THE ANSWERS TO SO COORDINATION OF THE FUNDING AND ALSO OF ACCESS TO CARE. AND PROMOTION THAT IS SOMETHING THAT AT A CALIFORNIA. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO FOR CARE UNLESS THERE'S A PART OF MONEY LOCALLY THAT IS DEDICATED FOR ADVERTISING. SO WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INSIGHT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE A BROAD RANGE OF EXPERIENCES OF THIS ISSUE OF BOTH PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. UP MANY LOCAL HOWELL AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR OMBUDSMAN SERVICES OF CONTRA COSTA SOLANO THANK YOU SUMMER KALRA AND DOVE FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY -- NOT ONLY AM I AM THE LEADER OF ORGANIZATION BUT I TO ALSO RECENTLY WALKED MY BELOVED GRANDMOTHER TO THE OTHER SIDE AND HAD TO HELP MY PARENTS NAVIGATE THE CHANGING. AND CHALLENGING LANDSCAPE OF MEDI CAL AND LOW INCOME ADULTS AND HOSPICE AND HOW THOSE THINGS WORK TOGETHER AND I COULD SEE THAT EVEN THOUGH I SEE MYSELF AS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE SYSTEM HOW CHALLENGING IT CAN BE. SO I FULLY SUPPORT THIS DUES -- DESIGNATION OF ADMINISTRATION TO BE LIVING AND WHAT THAT COULD MEAN I BELIEVE ADDED BEST WOULD BE TRULY A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS SUMMER PROGRAMS ARE DELIVERED AS DRUG SERVICES THAT WORKS WELL FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN LOOK TO THE LOCAL CALIFORNIA ELDER JUST COLLABORATIVE THEY'RE HAVING ON THE LOCAL LEVEL TO SEE WHAT TRULY INTEGRATED AND NO WRONG DOOR APPROACHES CAN LOOK LIKE. SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF LOCAL JUSTICE CENTER SAYS AND WE CAN LOOK TO THOSE PROCESSES TO SEE WHAT IS WORKING WELL AND TO SEE WHAT CAN BE IMPROVED. IN PREPARATION FOR THIS PANEL I REACHED OUT TO THOSE FOLKS UP LONGER MEMORIES AND I DO AND MORE EXPERIENCE AND THEY RECALL TIMES IN OUR PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS WAY HAD. TRIED TO ATTEND THESE KINDS OF CHANGES AND THEY WOULD MEET AND THEY WOULD THINK AND THEY WOULD BRAINSTORM. YET NOTHING CAME OF IT AND SO THEY IF WE ARE TO MAKE THIS PROMISE TO OUR LOCAL SENIORS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS I ASK THAT THIS REALLY BE AN EFFECTIVE AN INTEGRATED PROCESS THAT WE SEEK THE INPUT. OF THE LOCAL NOT ONLY THE TRIPLE A.'S BUT THE PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDING ADULT SERVICES WE NEED TO HEAR FROM THOSE DIRECT SERVER SOCIAL WORKERS AT THE APS LEVEL WE DO HEAR WHAT KIND OF DATA COLLECTION IS LOOKING FOR IN THE FUTURE -- I BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THE CHANGING NATURE OF SENIOR SERVICES WE ALSO NEED TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE CHANGE WORK FORCE AND WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE NOT ONLY THE NEED FOR CARE GIVERS BUT THE NEEDS. OF CARE GIVERS THAT WE SIMPLY CANNOT TRAIN ADDITIONAL CNA IS NOT RUNNING A PATHWAY TO SUPPORTIVE SERVICES WHERE THEY CAN SEEK A REAL SUSTAINABLE LIFE AND ALLIED HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THAT IS NOT SIMPLY FOUND AN ONLINE TRADING PLATFORMS WHILE THAT MAY BE PART OF IT AND I SEE THAT AS A MILLENNIUM. WE NEED SUPPORT OF SYSTEMS WHERE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO BUILD SYSTEM FOR FOLKS WHO WANT TO SERVE AND WORK WITH SENIORS AND SEE IT AS A VALUABLE PATHWAY. IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE'VE CREATED SOCIAL WORK SYSTEMS FOR THOSE WILLING TO WORK WITH CHILDREN AT RISK POOLS AND SITUATIONS WE NEED TO CREATE THE SAME KIND OF INCENTIVES TO BE A SOCIAL WORKER. AT THE GERIATRIC LEVEL AND FOR THAT I THINK WE CAN LOOK TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL. BUT WE'RE ALSO CALIFORNIA AND SO I WOULD ASK THAT WE TAKE WHAT IS BEST FROM THE FEDERAL MODEL WHAT IS WORKING FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD. AND CREATE THE BEST SYSTEM DESIGNING SYSTEM AND SERVICES THAT WE WANT AND THEN FIGURE OUT THE PROCESS THAT LATER ON I ASKED WE NOT BE STOPPED BY SIMPLY SAYING WE'VE ALWAYS DONE SOMETHING THIS WAY. THAT TRULY WE COME TOGETHER IN THIS ROOM OF INTEGRATED SYSTEMS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MY COLLEAGUES OF HOW THAT WILL WOR. THANK YOU. I DON'T THINK THE TWO OF US UP HERE TO DO THINGS THE WAY THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN DONE THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT AND AND ALSO FOR HIGHLIGHTING. THE THE THE FACT THAT THOSE CARRYING. FOR OUR ELDERS FOR SENIORS CAN BE LIVING IN POVERT- AND AND AND NEEDING CARE THEMSELVES WE WE NEED TO DO MORE TO HELP LIFT THOSE ARE ACTUALLY ARE ARE CARING FOR LETTING. THOSE THAT ARE IN NEED AND SO THANKS FOR HOW THAT IN THAT ASPECT OF JUSTICE AS WELL -- YEAH. THE I I'D LEAVE. YES I'M EILEEN KOONTZ DIRECTOR OF HUNTINGTON SENIOR KERR NETWORK. I AM. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNINGG ME - COMMITTEE. HEARING I'M. MY SITE HAS BEEN IN A SAYS HE PROVIDER MULTI. USER THIS PROGRAM PROVIDER SINCE IN. EIGHTY FOUR AND I SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TO A HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL. AND IS -- AM ASSIST P. IS A LONG TERM CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. AND I LIKE TO SAY THAT CARE MANAGEMENT IF I HAD TO DESCRIBE IT IN ONE WORD THAT WORD IS RELATIONSHIP. AND YOU SEE THAT IN THE PICTURE HERE AS WELL AS I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT THE PICTURE HERE ARE. OUR ACCOUNT MANAGERS -- ARE. MOST EFFECTIVE IF MAKE CONNECTS THAT'S NOT GOING TO REALLY GET A LOT DONE WE'RE GOING TO GET KICKED OUT OF THAT HOLE PRETTY QUICKLY IN SOURCE NOT HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE CONNECTIONS. I'M. SO THEY MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY LIVE IN THEIR OWN HOMES AND ADDRESS THE NEEDS THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE AND A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT. THE PROFILE AND WHAT MAKES IT -- PEOPLE AGE. SIXTY FIVE ARE TYPICAL CLIENT IS MORE LIKE IN HER EIGHTIES AND SHE'S FEMALE -- OVERWHELMINGLY FEMALE. I AM LOTS OF DIVERSITY IN. WAGE AND ETHNICITY AS WELL AS THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL INTERESTINGLY AT MY SITE WE SEE PEOPLE THAT ARE. EDUCATED BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL AS WELL AS PEOPLE I'M IT JUST ONE EIGHT YEARS OF FORMAL EDUCATION.

HANDS ON HUMAN HELP WITH ALMOST ALL ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING AND INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING SO YOU HEAR LOTS OF TALK ABOUT PEOPLE THAT COULD LEAVE NURSING HOMES. AND WE HAVE PEOPLE SUPPORTED AT HOME BUT THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE DANCING TOMORROW WE'RE GOING TO THE SENIOR CENTER NECESSARILY NECESSARILY -- COGNITIVE STATUS IN A ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IS OUR TYPICAL CLIENT AND THE MOST COMMON IS NORMAL COGNITION BUT THE OTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT IS MORE THAN HALF FOR CLIENTS HAVE. MILD TO MODERATE TO SEVERE -- COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND MORE THAN A THIRD WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE. I'M UP. AT MY SITE MOST OF OUR CLIENTS LIVE WITH ANOTHER PERSON WHETHER THAT'S AN ADULT DAUGHTER OR WHETHER THAT'S AN AGING SPOUSE OR WHETHER THAT'S A ROOMMATE THAT THEY RENT A ROOM FROM. AND THEN -- WE SERVE PEOPLE ON AVERAGE JUST UNDER FOUR YEARS. I'M SO STATE STATE WIDE THE PROGRAM SERVES TWELVE THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS AND HERE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAT'S THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED THIS IS OUR BASIC - ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA EIGHT SIXTY FIVE PLUS NURSING HOME CERTIFIABLE. AND ON MEDI CAL WITH NO SURE COST THAT'S A PRETTY IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT WE DO BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT CARE GIVER. THE HOME SYSTEM CAN RAVEL PRETTY QUICKLY AND CHANGE FROM -- BEING ABLE TO STAY AT HOME SAFELY TO BEING NEEDING NURSING HOME INSTITUTIONALIZATION. ARE WE HAVE A TEAM BASED APPROACHES ARE MODEL OF CARE WE HAVE NURSE. AND CARE MANAGERS AND SOCIAL WORK CARE MANAGERS THAT VISIT. AND SS INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR HOMES ASSESS THE FAMILY SITUATION AND THE HOME SAFETY AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND COME UP WITH A CARE PLAN IN- COLLABORATION WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR FAMILIES SO THAT THIS IS THE PLAN THAT. EVERYBODY SIGNING OFF ON EVERYBODY'S IN AGREEMENT WITH -- AND THEN OF COURSE WE COLLABORATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO MAKE SURE WE THIS IS MEDICAID MONEY SEEK OUT AND MAKE SURE YOU DO THINGS RIGHT OR YOU GET INTO TROUBLE QUICKLY. I'M. OUR STAFF -- ARE ALL AT A COST LOWER THAN I RIGHT AS I SAID THE LONG TERM CARE MANAGED AND IN A PERSON CENTERED WAY SO ONE PERSONS CARE PLAN IS NOT A COOKIE CUTTER TO WHAT AND THERE'S IS GONNA LOOK LIKE BY ANY MEANS. I'M AND THEN WE LINK THEM TO AND AND COORDINATE WITH THEIR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT THE INDIVIDUALS -- HALF. I'M. WE ALSO HAVE A UNIQUE ACTS ASPECT OF EMESIS PETE THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST FLEXIBLE AND POWERFUL -- INTERVENTIONS WHICH IS IF WE HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL COMMUNITY RESOURCES FAMILY ABILITY TO PAY FOR SOMETHING PUBLIC BENEFITS WE CAN ACTUALLY GOING TO PAY FOR SOMETHING. I'M TO MEET OUR NEEDS SO EXAMPLE JUST THE OTHER DAY WE HAD -- WE FOUND OUT SOMEBODY'S -- WATER WAS SHUT OFF BECAUSE THEY GOT BEHIND ON PAYING THE EIGHTY FIVE ALL AND IT BECAME A TWO HUNDRED AND SOMETHING DOLLAR PAYMENT THAT WAS NEEDED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE WATER GOING. AND THIS IS AT NINETY PLUS YEAR OLD CLIENT WHO IS. NOT GOING TO DO WELL WITHOUT WATER IN THE HOME AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO WITH A RELATIVELY SMALL INTERVENTION I'M REALLY RADICALLY CHANGE -- TO HER ABILITY TO STAY AT HOME. I'M JUST TO GIVE A KIND OF THE BIG PICTURE. I'M IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND MISSISSIPPI BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND I WAS EXPANDED I THINK ABOUT DOUBLED -- AND IN AND RECEIVED ITS FIRST TWO THOUSAND SIX RECEIVED IT'S SECOND AND ONLY. ONLY EVER RATE INCREASE -- FOLLOWED BY -- THE RECESSION YEARS OF ABOUT 22% IN FUNDING CUTS. I'M IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND THE COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE DEMONSTRATION COUNTIES -- AND MISSISSIPPI BECAME ONE OF THE BENEFITS AND SO -- WE WORK MUCH MORE CLOSELY AT THAT POINT -- FOUR YEARS AGO -- TO TO TODAY -- WITH HEALTH PLAN MEMBERS -- AS AN MSP CLIENTS. AND ALSO IT CONTINUES TO BE A WAIVER PROGRAM SOMEWHERE IN OUR FIFTH YEAR OF THE CURRENT WE RECYCLE. AND IN TWENTY OF AND SO IN TWO CYCLE BEGAN IN IN -- TWENTY TWENTY MISSISSIPPI IS SCHEDULED. TO TO A HEALTH PLAN BENEFIT IN THE C. C. I. COUNTIE. I'M AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY IN TERMS OF THEIR OLDER CAROL CALIFORNIANS ACT -- AND THE UPDATING OF OUT IN THE PROPOSAL. AND I CAN'T SPEAK FOR MY STATE ASSOCIATION AT THIS POINT WE NEED TO KIND OF TAKE INTO THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS JUST RELEASED A COUPLE DAYS AGO -- BUT I DO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE IDEA OF A CORD IN DEBT COORDINATED THAT WORK OF SERVICES. I'M PARTICULARLY PEOPLE NEEDING TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES IN WHATEVER WAYS THEY NEED -- AND WANT. AND AND I'M NOT EXACTLY COMPLETELY CLEAR ON WHAT THE LOCAL LEVEL WOULD LOOK LIKE -- FOR SERVICE DELIVERY AND SO WOULD NEED TO TALK IN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT NAY UNDERSTAND THAT -- I KNOW THE INNOCENT PEOPLE PROGRAM IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM SOME OF THE AGING PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THE MEDIC HOW ASPECT AND JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WERE. I'M CAREFUL WITH CELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EILEEN APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT AND INSIGHT. AND WILL CLOSE OUT THE SPENT WITH CLAY [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU. I DON'T MIND BEING CALLED YES THERE ARE SEATS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT SO PLEASE DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE OUT THE STAND THE BACK -- FIND A SEAT. MEET MEET A FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR. THANKS FOR HAVING US AND AND HOLDING HIS HEARING DOWN HERE I'M CLAY CAMP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SENIORS COUNCIL OF SANTA CRUZ AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES. AND AS THE PROGRAM SAYS I'M LEGISLATIVE CO CHAIR WITH VICTORIA FOR CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING AND THIS ONE THING ABOUT ABOUT THIS PROCESS DATE ACTUALLY STARTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO AS A FUNDING EFFORTS. IN IN THAT FINDING EFFORT IT'S HOW CAN WE MAKE THE CASE FOR THE NEED THAT'S OUT THERE AND ALL THESE GREAT PROGRAMS AND FRANKLY THE STRUGGLE EVERY YEAR WAS THERE'S SO MANY GREAT PROGRAMS WHICH ONE DO WE TAKE TO REALLY HIGHLIGHT. DO WE HIGHLIGHT ALL OF THEM AND THEN HAVE NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO ANY OF THEM OR WHAT TO DO BUT IN THAT PROCESS NOT ONLY DID WE REALIZE THAT THERE'S SO MANY GREAT PROGRAMS OUT THER. BUT WE STARTED THINKING ABOUT WHAT MAKES THEM CARRIERS THAT ARE IN PLACE TO STOP THEM FROM EVEN BEING BETTER. SO IN THAT CONVERSATION THAT LED TO THIS GREATER VISION OF WHAT COULD WE REALLY DO WITH OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT IN THAT LED TO THE VISION WE'RE NOW ON RIGHT NOW WHICH IS SET AT STOP AT OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACTOR WE NEED TO LOOK BEYOND THAT. AND REALLY CREATE THIS CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LIVING AT AND I THINK THROUGH MULTIPLE DISCUSSIONS BOTH IN SMALL SETTINGS AND LARGER SETTINGS WE ARRIVED BUT THE CONCEPT PAPER ALL WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. SO WHATEVER GOALS WITH THAT CONCEPT PAPERS TO GET IT OUT AND I KNOW THAT MOST OF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT WAS ONLY RECENTLY RELEASED BUT PART OF MAKING THIS HAPPEN IS WE'RE GOING TO NEED INPUT. ABOUT THE CONCEPT PAPER THAT'S THERE AND VICTORIA HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TO SEE WHAT PARTS OF IT WORK WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO EMBRACE AND MOVE FORWARD AND WHERE THE PROBLEMS WERE THE CHALLENGES ON THIS. WE DON'T WANT SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW ALL OF US ARE SPLIT ON WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT THIS PEACE OR WE DON'T LIKE THAT PIECE OR OR NOT WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AS A GROUP. AND I THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT. THE NETWORK OF AGING AND DISABLED SERVICES ARE JUST VERY VERY RICH IN TERMS OF QUALITY IN TERMS OF THE GREAT NEED OUT THERE AND AND IN TERMS OF WHO WE SERVE AND HOW WE GO ABOUT THAT SO. I'M REALLY ASKING EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM TO EMBRACE THE CONCEP. RIGHT TO THE HEART ABOUT THE CONCEPT TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE MAKE IT WORK AND EFFECTIVE TO ATTACK THE WEAKNESSES WE HAVE IN THIS SO THAT WHAT GOES FOR CAN BE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY PRODUCTIVE AND THAT WE'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT. AND I THINK EXCITEMENT IS WHAT I THINK ABOUT MOST WHEN I HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. IT'S IS TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING TO HAVE A COMMITTEE IN IT COMMITTEE CHAIR THAT'S EMBRACING THIS CONCEPT AND LEADING IT I MEAN IT HAS BEEN SO MANY YEARS SINCE WE'VE HAD THIS KIND OF LEADERSHIP. AND THIS POTENTIAL SO IT'S JUST WITH THE GRAY FULL OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THIS DISCUSSION AND YOU KNOW THE THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE IS SUPPORTIV- I IT IT REALLY DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER AND THIS IS TRULY I THINK ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS WE'VE DONE. ON AND JUST TAKE YOUR TIME TO WRAP UP I I THINK -- THE CONCEPT YOU KNOW A COUPLE PEOPLE THAT HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO BE PLACED IN THIS STRUCTURE. AND I THINK ALL OF US HAVE THAT CONCERN AND NONE OF US REALLY KNOW THE ANSWER BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS I'D LIKE TO ACTUALLY STEAL A SPORTS ANALOGY IF THERE'S ANY. GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS FANS OUT THERE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY TALK ABOUT IS STRENGTH IN NUMBERS. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS ROOM YOU KNOW WE HAVE STRENGTH IN NUMBERS AND THEN IF WE COME TOGETHER OUR STRENGTH AND OUR NUMBERS ARE SO MUCH GREATER THAN ANY OF US WORK IN THESE INDIVIDUAL SILO. EVEN IF WE HAVE SOME WINS IN THOSE INDIVIDUAL SILOS THEY TEND TO BE ISOLATED AND THE DON'T CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE SO I THINK WITH HIS GREATER CONCEPT WE CAN REALLY BUILD ON EACH OTHER SUCCESS. SUPPORT EACH OTHER WHERE THERE'S WEAKNESSES AND LEFT US ALL UP TO BE YOU KNOW WHERE THE SUN CAN BE BETTER THAN THE INDIVIDUAL PART. SO THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW EVERYBODY PLEASE ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLAY INTO ALL THE PANELISTS AND AND CLAY. I THINK ASKING FOR FEEDBACK FROM THIS CROWD YOU'RE GONNA GET IT. BUT BUT BUT I LIKE TO CALL FOR UNITY -- BECAUSE I THINK PART OF THE ISSUE IN GENERAL LEGISLATION I THINK THAT BUT THIS ISSUE AND WHEN IT COMES TO SENIORS AGE AT THAT THAT. OFTENTIMES GONNA YOU'LL SEE DIFFERENT GROUPS FOR YOUR FIGHTING FOR THEIR PIECE OF THE PIE. I THINK IS OPINION INITIALLY BUT IF WE CAN GET TO A COMMON GROUND AND THE MOVE TOGETHER AS ONE FORCE -- I THINK THAT WE CAN SEE GREAT SUCCESS AND SO THANK YOU AND AND ALL OF OF THIS MOVEMENT EVEN BEING OVER THE LAST COMPLETE. SO THEY AND FOR THAT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION A LOT OF FEEDBACK AND I'M GETTING MORE EXCITED ABOUT THE THE THE YEAR AHEAD -- AND SO WE HAVE ANOTHER PANEL -- OF A REGARDING. EXPANDING COORDIN THAT -- BUT WE JUST HEARD FROM SPOCE SPEAK E BY [INAUDIBLE] FOR CONSUMERS. THEY HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS AND THEY GO DOOR TO DOOR OR PHONE TO PHONE OR WEBSITE TO WEBSITE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS. OFTEN BEING REDIRECTED OR REFERRED OR REJECTED. AND WE URGE YOU TO PUT CONSUMERS FIRST USE THEIR LANDS TO DESIGN AN IDEAL SYSTEM. PICTURE THIS COMMON SCENARIO A FIFTY TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER LIVING IT AND AS A TRYING TO FIND HELP FOR HER SPANISH SPEAKING MOTHER. CARING FOR HER EIGHTY THREE YEAR OLD FATHER WITH DEMENTIA IN LONG BEACH WHERE DOES SHE STARK WHO IS THETS AND QUESTIONNAIRES WHO FOLLOWS UP? THERE ARE SO MANY VARIABLES WITH AGE INCOME DIZZY [INAUDIBLE] WE CAN. THEY'RE ONE OF THE SEC. RECKON IN IN A IN THE IS TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS ACCESS TO ESTABLISH CLEARING HOUSES WITH RELY INFORMATION -- DATA INDICATES THAT 60% OF CALIFORNIANS WITH MEMORY CONCERNS HAVE OR TALK TO THEIR DOCTOR. AND LESS THAN HALF HAVE A DIAGNOSIS WE NEED TRUSTED SOURCES OF ACCURATE INFORMATION. AND ABLE TO CONSUMERS ON DEMAND AND ACCESSIBLE IN PERSON ONLINE AND BY PHONE -- IN FACT WE PARTNER AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON COMMUNITY LIVING. THEY FUND OUR NATION WIDE COMMUNITY RESOURCE FINDER IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S AVAILABLE IN CALIFORNIA IN EVERY SINGLE ZIP CODE. ALREADY IN EXISTENCE AND WE JUST EXPANDED THAT PARTNERSHIP TO INCLUDE A A. R. P. NATIONWIDE. THE THIRD TOPIC IS -- WE WRESTLE AT THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION WITH STATION VERSUS INTEGRATION DO WE CARP ALZHEIMER'S OUT OR DO WE CARVE IT IN. THE ALSO STICK A RESOURCE CENTERS ARE IN IT. OUTSTANDING EXAMPLE OF SPECIALIZATION BUT THEY WEREN'T WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THEIR HEYDAY AND THEY'RE VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT TODAY. IF WE TAKE THE RISK OF TRULY ADOPTING THE PRINCIPLES OF PERSON CENTERED CARE. AND WE FOCUS THE NEEDS ON THE WHOLE PERSON WE CAN INTEGRATE ALZHEIMER'S INTO PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND WE WON'T NEED TO CARVE. OUT AND SPECIALIZED AS WE'VE DONE -- BY INTEGRATING INTO MS AS PC BASS AND PACE AND OTHER SETTINGS. IF WE ADOPT PERSON CENTERED CARE AND HOPE PERSON CARE PHILOSOPHIES SO THAT'S AN AREA WILL BE WATCHING CLOSELY AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IS ACKNOWLEDGED AND ADDRESSED. IN THE NEXT ITERATION OF THE OLDER CALIFORNIA ACT AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INCLUDING US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE ALMOND HYSTERICAL LAND AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF A SPECIES IN THE SERVICES. A PRIVATE NONPROFIT. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION BASED IN SACRAMENTO. AND BEFORE I TAKE THE HELMETS ACCC THE SERVICES I SERVE AS THE TEAM LEADER AGING SERVICES PROGRAM SPECIALIST WITH THE US ADMINISTRATION FOR COMING TWO LIVING WHICH MANY PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED. AND IN THAT CAPACITY I WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE TELEPHONE IT UPON OF AGING. HAWAII EXCEPT IF OFFICE ON AGIN. AMERICAN SAMOA TERRITORIAL MINISTRATION AGING ONE NATIVE HAWAIIAN ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS A THIRTY THREE TRIBAL GRANTEES IN CALIFORNIA. SO AS YOU MAY BE AWARE -- DE OLDER AMERICANS ACT WAS ENACTED BY THE CONGRESS IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE IN. RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNED BY POLICY MAKERS ABOUT A LACK OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES FOR ORDER ABOUT. IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT ARE OLDER AMERICANS ACT WAS A MENDOCINE WHICH ESTABLISH PROGRAMS FOR THE PROVISION. OF NUTRITION AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR NATIVE AMERICANS. IN THE PROGRAM HAS SINCE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE. CAREGIVER SUPPORT. VERSUS BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND SO ELIGIBLE TRIBAL ORGANISES IS RECEIVE PRIZE IN SUPPORT. IN DELIVERY OF HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. FOR THE ALBUMS INCLUDING NUTRITION SERVICES ANSWER BUT FOR FAMILY AN INFORMAL CHARACTERS. SO THE AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION COMES FROM A SECTIONS. SIX THIRTEEN SIX TWENTY THREE AND SIX THIRTY ONE OF THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT AS AMENDED. SO YOU LOOK AT CALIFORNIA. RAZA AN INSTITUTION COLD -- DIVISION EIGHT POINTS I'VE CHAPTER ONE SECTION. NINE THOUSAND IT TALKS ABOUT. THE URGENCY TO REFLECTS THE OLDER CALIFORNIA'S ACT -- WITH THE MANDATES AND DIRECTIVES OF THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT. A IN OUR OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE ITS COMMITMENT TO THIS ORDER. IN AN OLDER POPULATION SERVED BY PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE LEGISLATION VERY CAREFULLY TO ONLY. MENTIONED TWICE ABOUT. OUR AMERICAN INDIANS DOES SECTION NINETY FIFTEEN ABOUT GREATEST SOCIAL NEEDS AND THEN SECTION NINETY ONE OH THREE POINT ONE ACCESS TO PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL PICTURE IN TERMS OF THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT PART. TWO SIX SO BASICALLY WE HAVE NUTRITION AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE CARE GIVER SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. AND THE PURPOSE OF TITLE ACTUALLY IS TO PROMOTE. THE DELIVERY OF THESE SERVICES UP. TO AMERICAN INDIANS TO ALASKA NATIVES AS WELL AS NATIVE HAWAIIANS. THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO SERVICE. I CAN THAT [INAUDIBLE] THIS [INAUDIBLE] IS. THIS CAN NEED. INDIVIDUALS ONE ALLIANCE AYE VITAL RESOURCE. ENTITLED TO ALL OF US SERVICES AVAILABLE AND SUCH SERVICES AND MAP IT SHOULD BE PROVIDED IN A MANNER. THAT FREE SERVICE AND RESTORE SERVICE TO THINK IT SEVERANCE BACKED AND CULTURAL IDENTITIES. NOW IF YOU COMPARE THAT WITH THE OR THE CALIFORNIA'S ACT. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NOTHING EACH. AGENCY PLAN SHALL PROVIDE INFORMATION CONCERNING SERVICES TO OLDER INDIANS. AND ASSURE THAT AREA AGENCY RECORD IN A SERVICES WITH THOSE PROVIDED ON THE PART OF SIX AND THEN ANOTHER SECTION. THREE OH SEVEN EIGHT TWENTY ONE EIGHTY BASICALLY APPLIES THE STATE PLAN. WHICH ACTUALLY IS SO DEVELOP BY THE CALIFORNIA ABOUT AGING. AND IS SHALL OUR STORE THAT'S THE STATE AGENCY RECORDED WITH PROGRAMS. ON HOW TO THREE WITH PROGRAMS ON THE HOW.

WITH A TOTAL GRANT AMOUNT LOOK AT MORE THAN FORTY FIVE MINUTE DOLLARS. IF YOU LOOK. REPRESENTING OVER FORTY FOUR DIFFERENT TRIBES. AND ALSO RECEIVING FREE ONE EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE A NATIONAL PICTURE OF ALL THE SERVICE DELIVERY -- IN NINETEEN A IS TO IT SO SORRY- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THERE OVER SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND RIGHTS IN TERMS OF TRANSPORTATION. AND THOSE ARE THE RICE -- TO NEW SITES TO MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS PHARMACIES GROCERY STORES AND A CRITICAL DAILY ACTIVITIES.

PAID FAMILY CARE GIVER IN CALIFORNIA. LARGELY EMAIL THAT CHANGES ABOUT FORTY SEVEN BUT 40% ARE MEN. AND NOT OF SAYING. WE ARE ACTUALLY IT WHAT IS THE PROPER THING IS MOST OF ONE OUT OF THE FOUR CHARACTERS HAS BEEN IN BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE AND NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THAT MEANS THERE BETWEEN. TWENTY TWO AND THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD. AT THESE ARE KIDS GIVERS THAT TRIED TO BALANCE BOTH THEIR EARLY CAREERS. SCHOOL. PARENTHOOD AND AARON OR A GRANDPARENT OR OTHER CLOSE RELATIVE -- ONCE ACT FOR FAMILY CARE GIVERS HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT REALLY BEEN ALL ADDRESSED AND LOOK AT OF MANY TIMES THE CALL US. FOR THE FANS ARE NOT BLEED TRIVIAL AND FOR THE CARE GIVERS WHILE PEOPLE. DO THIS OUT OF LOVE AND WE OFTEN SAID THIS IS A FAMILY AFFAIR. THERE IS SOME RESPONSIBILITY I THINK IN OUR SYSTEM EIGHTY TO HELP OUT AS IF YOU LOOK AT HERE. ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE LONG TERM CARE SYSTEM. AND IN RETURN WHAT HAS. CALIFORNIAN WOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN BACK TO THE SYSTEM FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. ASIDE A PART FOR THE PERSON. PORT SO. ONE PROGRAM THAT. HAS BEEN IN SALEM. HAS BEEN THE STATE CALIPHATE YE. NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT UP HAS BEEN THE CALIFORNIA CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTER. WHICH IS A THE WAY OF PROVIDING. INDIVIDUALIZED SERVICES FOR OR CALIFORNIA CARE GIVERS HOWEVER.

THE ARE LINKED TO WITH THE REBEL AND WILL BEGIN TO HELP PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT THE FAMILY MEMBERS MOST PEOPLE DON'T. CARE. THEIR DAUGHTER. THEIR SPOUSES. THERE FOR AND AND PART OF ALSO MEANS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT EVEN THINGS LIKE AWARENESS CAMPAIGN IN CALIFORNIA. NEED TO QUIT CARE GIVERS WITH VERY EASY AND DECIBEL INFORMATION TRADING IT'S REALLY. TAKEN UP SO CULTURALLY COMPETENT AT ELEVEN THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO USE THAT INFORMATION. WE ARE TOLD OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE INTEGRATE CARE GIVERS TO THE HOSPITAL SAYS. AND SUPPORT THEM IN NAVIGATING THEY CAN CONTINUE IN THERE ARE GIVING THIS WHICH MEANS WE DO HAVE TO PRINT IT. PROGRAMS OLDER IT IS AN OPTION WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK INCREASE FUNDING FOR THE SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. ON THE RECEIPT TO SET THREE CUT IT HAS NOT COME BACK. BUT THE HELP RENOVATE. NOT WOULD YOU TRY TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM WANTED HAND SYSTEM FOR THE CAT POINT A CARE GIVER RESOURCE SECTORS SO THAT THEY CAN BEGIN TO MODERN EYES AND A DEBT.

SEE IF I'LL SEE SUPPORTS THE REIMAGINE EIGHT AT THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT CHANGING THE PARADIGM OF SERVICE DELIVERY CONCEPT PAPER. IN OUR EXPERIENCE THE COORDINATED SERVICE DELIVERY PROVIDED THROUGH THE EXISTING AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTIONS HAS GIVEN INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS AND AREA AGENCIES ON AGING.

CALIFORNIA'S DISABILITY AND AGING COMMUNITIES DESERVEF ANY S SYSTEM. CHANGING THE PARADIGMS OF SERVICE DELIVERY AND MOVING TOWARD THE WHITE. ON THE LIVING OVER.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND DEFINITELY AGREE -- THAT WHEN YOU DO MORE TO SUPPOR. INDEPENDENT A CENTERS AND AND TO SOME OF THE OTHER COMMENTS -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S NO MENTION OF CARE GIVERS AND THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT AND SO I THINK THAT. THIS REIMAGINING IS AND AND MODERNIZING IS ALSO A RECOGNITION. OF THE RE THE THE THE ACTUAL REALITY THAT SO MANY CARE GIVERS SO MANY FAMILIES ARE FACING AND MANY TIMES IN SILENCE. BECAUSE THEY SEE IT AS THEIR PROBLEM OTHERS A FAMILY ISSUE IT IS THE STATE'S PROBLEM AND THEN THE STATE NEEDS TO BE BE THERE. OFFICES -- ASSISTANCE AND HELP SO THANK YOU ALL FOR LAYING THAT CONTACTS DOWN I MEAN THIS IS BEEN REALLY HELPFUL FOR ME AND WE DO HAVE. NOT TOO MUCH TIME -- IF THERE IS ANYONE THAT DOES HAVE -- ANY PUBLIC COMMENT -- WILL RESTRICTED JUST TO A A MINUTE OR SO AND AND TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT -- FOR FIVE OR SIX MINUTES -- IF THERE IS ANYONE THAT HAS. A BURNING COMMENT OR QUESTION. HI I'M TO DESTROY EACH -- I WAS THE DIRECTOR DEVELOPMENT FOR THESE HIS CENTER IN LONGEVITY. AND THE DIVISION OF GERIATRICS FROM NINE AND A HALF YEARS -- I WOULD JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE MINUTES OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS -- WITH OLDER ADULTS BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE HUMANITY THAT'S INVOLVED HERE -- AS I SPEAK MY FATHER IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING AN EMERGENCY PROCEDURE. BECAUSE THE JEWISH OF THE AGING WHERE HE IS AT REALLY CARE FOR HIM. AND SO WE'RE HOPING THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE HIS LEG. OF THIS MORNING -- I NEVER THOUGHT MY PARENTS NINETY TO NINETY FOUR WOULD EXPERIENCE A KIND OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT THAT I'M SEEING. AND I AM DOING MY BEST TO RESENT IT IT'S THE CHOICE EISENBERG HE FOR MEDICAL CENTER OF THE LOS ANGELES JUSHIN FOR THE AGING AND SEE THAT. SPOKE WITH OVER SIXTY FOUR GOVERNMENT REGULATORY AND SENIOR RELATED AGENCIES AND PEOPLE -- MY PARENTS HAVE TO CHANGE NURSING HOMES TOGETHER. BECAUSE AFTER SIXTY EIGHT YEARS OF MARRIAGE. SEPARATING THEM WOULD KILL THEM. I'M ON MANY WAITING LISTS HOSPITALS CAN ONLY MOVE THE PATIENT ACTUALLY IN THEIR HOSPITAL. WHICH MEANS THAT THEY CANNOT MOVE THE SPOUSE AT THE SAME TIM. AND I CANNOT FIND A NURSING HOME THAT WILL TAKE TWO PEOPLE. WHO ARE ON MEDICARE? MEDICAID OUT TOGETHER -- THE HOSPITAL DOCTORS RECOMMENDED REMOVING PARENTS IN THE JEWISH HOME -- I'M TOLD THAT THE HOME IS BEEN REPORTED FOR ABUSE AND NEGLECT OF MY PARENTS BY UCLA MEDICAL CENTER. SANTA MONIC UCLA MEDICAL CENTER WEST LOS ANGELES VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITAL. AND NORTHRIDGE HOSPITAL. THEY'VE ALSO BEEN TARZAN ANOTHER NEIGHBORING HOSPITALS -- THE HOME HAS A VERY ACTIVE BUILDING PROGRAM FOR EXPENSIVE HOUSING WITH MULTI MILLION DOLLAR BUY INS BUT NO PLANS TO IMPROVE FACILITIES OR LIFESAVING SERVICES FOR THEIR NURSING HOME. RESIDENTS [INAUDIBLE] I'M. THE HOME IS THE NINE MY FATHER NON KOSHER FOOD HE LOVES EVEN OUTSIDE OF THE KOSHER DINING ROOM. NOT ALLOW WILL ONLY ALLOW ME OR COMPANION TO FEED HIM. HOWEVER -- HAVING HAD A PART TIME PRIVATE COMPANION FOR A MONTH. THE HOME TOLD ME THAT MEDI CAL WILL NOT ALLOW. ANY ADDITIONAL COMPANION OR ASSISTANCE FOR EITHER PARENT. AS LONG AS A ON THAT ACCOUNT. SO YOU CAN'T GET ADDITIONAL HEL. OF FROM THE OUTSIDE. AT MY FATHER -- WITHOUT HIS COMPANION HAS RETURNED TO DEHYDRATION AND MALNUTRITION. EVEN WITH TO FEEDING THAT THE DOCTORS YOU SEE PLAY. PROVIDE AND TO QUOTE AS SHIRIN'S AGAINST THE CARE THE HOT. I'M SO THIS IS REALLY A VERY CRITICAL SITUATION TODAY. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MOVE THEM. THE HOME CAN DO ANYTHING THEY WANT -- THE ABUSE AND NEGLECT IS TREMENDOUS. I'M VERY SORRY INTO THIS AND AND UP.

AS WE MOVE FORWARD FOR THE LEGISLATION AND OR OR BOOK POLICY BUT THAT'S PART OF WHY KING.
