OF DATA WHICH IS A HUB THAT

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:01.739
BASICALLY BRINGS IN ALL OF THOSE

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:03.107
DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES SO THAT

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:04.375
WE CAN DO MORE PREDICTIVE

00:39:04.442 --> 00:39:05.876

DATA MAY LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT

00:39:38.008 --> 00:39:39.844
EVERYTHING CAN COME INTO ONE

01:41:40.093 --> 01:41:40.594
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE MAKES

01:41:40.661 --> 01:41:41.929
SENSE WE ARE WAITING TO REVIEW

01:41:41.995 --> 01:41:43.564
THE LANGUAGE AND WE LIKE TO LOOK

01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:45.265
AT IT IN LIGHT OF UPDATED ACTUAL

01:41:45.332 --> 01:41:47.301
IS ON HOW LONG IT IS TAKING TO

01:41:47.367 --> 01:41:47.868
GET THROUGH THE PROCESS FOR

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:49.570
THESE FAMILIES.

01:41:49.636 --> 01:41:50.938
THANK YOU FINANCE.

01:41:51.004 --> 01:41:54.241
RIGHT A PUBLIC COMMENT.

01:41:54.308 --> 01:41:55.742
IT IS SHORT FOR THE ALLIANCE FOR

01:41:55.809 --> 01:41:56.710
CHILDREN'S RIGHTS AND WE

01:41:56.777 --> 01:41:58.412
APPRECIATE THE EXTENSION OF THE

01:41:58.479 --> 01:42:00.447
EMERGENCY CARE GIVER FUNDING.

01:42:00.514 --> 01:42:01.448
TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS BUT

01:42:01.515 --> 01:42:03.717
WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE

01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:05.786
GOOD CAUSE EXCEPTION CONTINUE TO

01:42:05.853 --> 01:42:07.488
BE FO THE FULL THREE HUNDRED

01:42:07.554 --> 01:42:09.056
AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS AND NOT BE

01:42:09.122 --> 01:42:11.024
CUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS

01:42:11.091 --> 01:42:13.026
AS PROPOSED -- THE PRIOR ISSUE

01:42:13.093 --> 01:42:14.661
SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT RESOURCE

01:42:14.728 --> 01:42:15.229
FAMILY APPROVAL STILL HAS A

01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:16.897
BACKLOG WE KNOW THAT IT'S STILL

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:19.399
TAKING ON AVERAGE A HUNDRED AND

01:42:19.466 --> 01:42:20.467
EIGHTY DAYS TO GET THREE

01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:21.668
RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL WHICH

01:42:21.735 --> 01:42:23.237
MEANS MANY FAMILIES ARE TAKING.

01:42:23.303 --> 01:42:24.304
MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

01:42:24.371 --> 01:42:26.006
DAYS TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS

01:42:26.073 --> 01:42:27.774
SO IF YOU CUT OFF FUNDING AT A

01:42:27.841 --> 01:42:29.176
HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS WITH NO GOOD

01:42:29.243 --> 01:42:30.978
BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY PUNISHING

01:42:31.044 --> 01:42:31.912
THOSE FAMILIES GOOD BECAUSE

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.514
MEANS THERE WAS A FINDING THAT

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:34.915
IT'S NOT THE CARE GIVERS FAULT.

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:36.450
AND IT'S NOT THE COUNTY'S FAULT

01:42:36.517 --> 01:42:38.185
THAT THE DELAY IS TAKING SO LONG

01:42:38.252 --> 01:42:38.919
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULD

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:40.487
DEPRIVE THOSE CHILDREN AND

01:42:40.554 --> 01:42:42.389
FAMILIES OF ON GOING CRITICAL

01:42:42.456 --> 01:42:43.824
FUNDING THAT STABILIZES

01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:45.392
PLACEMENTS WHEN IT'S BEEN

01:42:45.459 --> 01:42:47.227
DETERMINED THAT IT'S NO FAULT OF

01:42:47.294 --> 01:42:48.996
ANYONE THAT THE DELAYS TAKEN SO

EIGHTY DAYS SO WAS THERE A

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.908
REASON.

01:43:34.975 --> 01:43:41.615
FOR MOVING IT FROM.

WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS LAST YEAR

01:43:52.092 --> 01:43:53.260
AND THE GOAL IS TO LOOK AT YEAR

01:43:53.327 --> 01:43:53.894
BY YEAR TO SEE WHERE THINGS ARE

01:43:53.961 --> 01:43:54.561

01:43:54.628 --> 01:43:55.963
OF THE DEPARTMENT AND COUNTIES

OF WORKS -- VERY WELL TOGETHER

01:43:58.198 --> 01:43:59.666
MAKING SIGNIFICANT STRIDES ON

01:43:59.733 --> 01:44:02.536
REDUCING THAT BACK LONG TIME --

01:44:02.603 --> 01:44:04.838
TO APPROVE AN APPLICATION -- SO

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:06.807
CONSIDERING THAT AS WELL AS THE

01:44:06.873 --> 01:44:07.374
ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT WAS

01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:08.375
INCLUDED IN.

01:44:08.442 --> 01:44:09.810
THE ME REVISION FOR THAT ARE ARE

01:44:09.876 --> 01:44:11.178
IF THEY ADMINISTRATION IN THE

01:44:11.244 --> 01:44:14.081
BACKLOG -- WE WE FEEL CONFIDENT

01:44:14.147 --> 01:44:16.550
THAT THE THE TIME IS GONNA

01:44:16.617 --> 01:44:19.252
CONTINUE TO REDUCE AND BEST

01:44:19.319 --> 01:44:20.520
PRACTICES LEARN FROM THE

01:44:20.587 --> 01:44:21.822
CHALLENGES LEAVE THOSE THAT.

01:44:21.888 --> 01:44:23.724
ARE POTENTIALLY NONCE -- RELATED

01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:25.692
TO THE THE CARE GIVER OR THE

01:44:25.759 --> 01:44:27.427
COUNTY THAT WE SHOULD SEE

01:44:27.494 --> 01:44:29.596
REDUCTION AND THAT -- SO THAT'S

01:44:29.663 --> 01:44:31.798
WHY WE WE LOOKED AT EXTENDING

01:44:31.865 --> 01:44:34.701
THE POOL TIME TWO HUNDRED TWENTY

01:44:34.768 --> 01:44:36.169
DAYS FROM HER NINETEEN TO GIFT

01:44:36.236 --> 01:44:37.871
WHERE THE STATE COVERS A COUNTY

01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:39.840
SHARE BUT ALSO REDUCING THAT

01:44:39.906 --> 01:44:41.208
GOOD KONSTANTIN.

01:44:41.274 --> 01:44:42.576
JUST AGAINST IT TO SEE HOW

01:44:42.643 --> 01:44:44.244
THINGS WORK AS WE ARE SEEN GOOD

01:44:44.311 --> 01:44:45.278
STRIDES AND EVERYTHING WE'RE

01:44:45.345 --> 01:44:51.284
SAYING IS THE INTENT OF OF ALL

01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:52.786
OF THIS LEGISLATION AND IS. TO

01:44:52.853 --> 01:44:53.720
GET THE APPROVAL DONE WITHIN

01:44:53.787 --> 01:44:54.588
NINETY DAYS TO GET THE CARE

01:44:54.655 --> 01:44:55.222
GIVERS THE FUNDING AND ALSO GET

01:44:55.288 --> 01:44:55.856
THEM MOVING FORWARD TO THE NEXT

01:44:55.922 --> 01:44:56.890
LEVEL OF CARE THAT THEY MAY BE

01:44:56.957 --> 01:44:58.859
RECEIVING.

01:44:58.925 --> 01:45:00.794
OKAY WELL I MEAN I APPRECIATE

01:45:00.861 --> 01:45:01.795
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I THINK

01:45:01.862 --> 01:45:03.597
THE OBVIOUSLY THE GOAL IS I MEAN

01:45:03.664 --> 01:45:06.833
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE. TO

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:07.934
THREE AT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY

01:45:08.001 --> 01:45:08.535
FIVE DAYS.

01:45:08.602 --> 01:45:10.137
SO I MEAN THE HOPE IS IS IN THE

01:45:10.203 --> 01:45:12.339
GOAL IS TO SHRINK THAT TIME AND

01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:12.906
THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING WERE

01:45:12.973 --> 01:45:14.074
DESTROYED ALLOCATING THE MONEY

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:15.909
I'M I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT WHAT

01:45:15.976 --> 01:45:17.444
HAPPENS IS UNTIL WE PROVE WE'VE

01:45:17.511 --> 01:45:18.445
DONE THAT.

01:45:18.512 --> 01:45:19.446
RIGHT I MEAN WE'RE PUTTING THE

01:45:19.513 --> 01:45:20.881
RESOURCES MAKING DECISIONS A

01:45:20.947 --> 01:45:24.217
DRIVE THAT BUT UNTIL WE PROVEN

01:45:24.284 --> 01:45:24.951
WE'VE DONE THAT.

01:45:25.018 --> 01:45:26.386
IF WE ALSO CHANGE THE LANGUAGE

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:27.921
TO SAY BECAUSE THEY HAS IS AGAIN

01:45:27.988 --> 01:45:30.023
IT'S FOR GOOD COPS SO IT'S NOT A

01:45:30.090 --> 01:45:33.093
SITUATION WHERE A PERSON DEL

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:33.960
THEY'RE SAYING ARMS GOING TO

01:45:34.027 --> 01:45:35.862
STALL AND WAIT FOR THE UNDER

01:45:35.929 --> 01:45:36.596
SIXTY FIVE AND DRAG THIS THING

01:45:36.663 --> 01:45:38.098
OUT IF THEY'RE DRAGGING IT OUT

01:45:38.165 --> 01:45:39.066
THEN THEY DON'T.

01:45:39.132 --> 01:45:41.935
GET THE MONEY ANYWAY.

01:45:42.002 --> 01:45:42.669
I I DON'T FAMILIES GETTING

01:45:42.736 --> 01:45:44.471
CAUGHT BETWEEN SO IDEALLY WHAT

01:45:44.538 --> 01:45:45.706
HAPPENS WE MADE INVESTMENT WITH

01:45:45.772 --> 01:45:46.473
A SHRINK THOSE BACKLOGS SHRINK

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:47.841
THE TIME AND VERY FEW PEOPLE

01:45:47.908 --> 01:45:49.276
ACTUALLY GOT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF

01:45:49.342 --> 01:45:50.677
IT AT THAT OUTSIDE BUT IF.

01:45:50.744 --> 01:45:53.313
WE HAPPEN TO BE A LITTLE WRONG.

01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:54.614
AND THERE'S SOME FAMILIES WERE

01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:55.382
CAUGHT THERE I HATE FOR THEM TO

01:45:55.449 --> 01:45:57.484
GET FALL BETWEEN THE CRACKS SO I

01:45:57.551 --> 01:45:58.552
GUESS THAT'S WHY I DON'T QUITE

01:45:58.618 --> 01:46:00.187
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

01:46:00.253 --> 01:46:01.755
SHOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE THE

01:46:01.822 --> 01:46:03.190
STATE THEY THEMSELVES DRAG IT

01:46:03.256 --> 01:46:06.993
OUT THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:07.327
MONEY ANYWAY.

01:46:07.394 --> 01:46:09.730
RIGHT. EIGHT THREE WITH

01:46:09.796 --> 01:46:10.864
RECOGNIZING THIS CONCERNS AND

01:46:10.931 --> 01:46:12.399
THAT'S WHERE THE WE TAKE AN

01:46:12.466 --> 01:46:14.067
APPROACH IN THERE THIS ISN'T

01:46:14.134 --> 01:46:16.169
WITH US IN THIS TO BE A FINAL

01:46:16.236 --> 01:46:16.970
SOLUTION THE ANIMAL -- IN

01:46:17.037 --> 01:46:18.538
SOLUTION FOR EVERYTHING -- AND

01:46:18.605 --> 01:46:19.539
YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WTH

01:46:19.606 --> 01:46:20.173
THE DEPARTMENT OF COUNTY TO SEE

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:21.541
HOW THINGS ARE GOING AND WORK

01:46:21.608 --> 01:46:24.077
WITH THEM ON ON THE BEST WAY TO

01:46:24.144 --> 01:46:25.312
GO FORWARD ON EVERYTHING.

01:46:25.378 --> 01:46:27.614
I APPRECIATE THAT OKAY WELL YOU

01:46:27.681 --> 01:46:29.382
SEE THAT YES IF I MAY TO I I

01:46:29.449 --> 01:46:30.016
JUST WANT TO CLARIFY ALTHOUGH

01:46:30.083 --> 01:46:30.650
TECHNICALLY THE STATUE DOESN'T

01:46:30.717 --> 01:46:32.285
REQUIRE PAYMENT BE ON THOSE TIME

01:46:32.352 --> 01:46:34.187
FRAMES WE FIND IT HIGHLY

01:46:34.254 --> 01:46:36.523
UNLIKELY THAT COUNTIES WOULD AT

01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:37.691
THE END OF THE DAY.

01:46:37.758 --> 01:46:39.860
NOT CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT

01:46:39.926 --> 01:46:45.465
BEYOND WHAT THE STATE PROVIDES

01:46:45.532 --> 01:46:47.100
SHOULD THE PROCESS TAKE LONGER.

01:46:47.167 --> 01:46:47.701
NOT NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THEY

01:46:47.768 --> 01:46:48.301
WOULD BUT I THINK THE

01:46:48.368 --> 01:46:48.935
ADMINISTRATION IS VIEWING THIS

01:46:49.002 --> 01:46:50.504
AS A GRADUAL PHASE DOWN TOWARD

01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:51.872
THE ULTIMATE GOAL.

01:46:51.938 --> 01:46:53.840
OF GETTING WHERE WE ARE AND WHO

01:46:53.907 --> 01:46:55.075
WE THINK OF MAINTAINING GOOD

01:46:55.142 --> 01:46:56.977
BECAUSE THROUGH IS THREE SIXTY

01:46:57.043 --> 01:46:58.011
FIVE PROBABLY MERITS FURTHER

01:46:58.078 --> 01:47:01.081
DISCUSSION -- ME IN REGARDS OF

01:47:01.148 --> 01:47:02.382
WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO

01:47:02.449 --> 01:47:03.583
APPRECIATE JUST I JUST WANT

01:47:03.650 --> 01:47:05.085
FAMILIES BEING PUNISHED FOR

01:47:05.152 --> 01:47:06.353
SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE EIGHT AND

01:47:06.419 --> 01:47:08.221
AGAIN THE GOAL IS WE DON'T WANT

01:47:08.288 --> 01:47:09.756
PEOPLE AT THE IS THIS.

01:47:09.823 --> 01:47:10.857
RIGHT YES YES OKAY AND I

01:47:10.924 --> 01:47:12.025
APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S

01:47:12.092 --> 01:47:13.493
LEADERSHIP AND INVESTING AND AND

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:14.995
MAKING THAT HAPPEN BY PUTTING

01:47:15.061 --> 01:47:16.663
THE INVESTMENT I JUST DON'T.

ANY OF THESE ISSUES I THINK ONE

02:04:06.272 --> 02:04:07.807
THING THAT WE DID REYES AND OUR

02:04:07.873 --> 02:04:09.675
ANALYSIS IN JANUARY WAS THAT

02:04:09.742 --> 02:04:10.910
THERE IS A PROPOSAL.

02:04:10.976 --> 02:04:12.378
TO AUGMENT THE HOUSING AND

02:04:12.444 --> 02:04:14.814
DISABILITY THE H. DOT PROGRAM

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.615
FOR IT THE SSI RECIPIENT -- AND

02:04:16.682 --> 02:04:18.984
THAT PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY NOT SET

02:04:19.051 --> 02:04:20.653
TO EXPIRE IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO

02:04:20.719 --> 02:04:23.389
THIS IS A FUNDING ON TOP OF THE

02:04:23.455 --> 02:04:23.956
THREE YEAR FUNDING THAT WAS

02:04:24.023 --> 02:04:26.025
ORIGINALLY -- PROVIDED SO WE DID

02:04:26.091 --> 02:04:27.193
RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT.

02:04:27.259 --> 02:04:28.460
YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU

02:04:28.527 --> 02:04:30.329
THINK ABOUT THAT COMPARED TO

02:04:30.396 --> 02:04:31.797
THIS PROGRAM AND PERHAPS THERE

02:04:31.864 --> 02:04:34.400
COULD BE SOME FUNDING IF IF YOU

02:04:34.466 --> 02:04:41.674
WERE TO PRIORITIZE THE AND THE

02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:42.708
BRINGING FAMILIES HOME.

02:04:42.775 --> 02:04:43.442
PROJECT HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT

02:04:43.509 --> 02:04:44.710
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ON

02:04:44.777 --> 02:04:45.878
H. STOP IN IS THERE SOME SOME

02:04:45.945 --> 02:04:48.047
FLEXIBILITY THERE.

THAT US I DID YOU I SAY

02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:56.255
SOMETHING YEAH I AND I JUST I I

02:04:56.322 --> 02:05:00.359
THINK SPECIFICALLY IF -- IF

02:05:00.426 --> 02:05:01.927
THERE WAS A AND FUNDED THAT WE

02:05:01.994 --> 02:05:02.595

02:05:02.661 --> 02:05:02.795
HOME.

02:05:02.862 --> 02:05:03.629
PROGRAM I THINK THAT HAVE TO

02:05:03.696 --> 02:05:05.564
SPECIFICALLY BE AUGMENTED BY THE

02:05:05.631 --> 02:05:06.165
LEGISLATURE AT THIS POINT THAT

02:05:06.232 --> 02:05:07.867
OKAY. TO SAY THAT THEY WANT X.

02:05:07.933 --> 02:05:08.868
AMOUNT OF DOLLARS TO GO TOWARDS

02:05:08.934 --> 02:05:10.569
OUR HOGAN FOR ANYTHING.

02:05:10.636 --> 02:05:11.837
OKAY MR MECCA.

02:05:11.904 --> 02:05:13.005
WE WOULD THAT WE KNOW THE

02:05:13.072 --> 02:05:14.540
DEPARTMENT IS GATHERING DATA

02:05:14.607 --> 02:05:16.542
FROM THE THE PILOT AND AND THERE

02:05:16.609 --> 02:05:18.244
WAS A RAMP UP PERIOD BECAUSE IT

02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:19.845
WAS A BRAND NEW PROGRAM AND SO.

02:05:19.912 --> 02:05:20.846
OPERATIONALLY TO ASK THE

02:05:20.913 --> 02:05:22.448
COUNTIES TO CLOSE THE PROGRAM

02:05:22.514 --> 02:05:23.515
DOWN.

02:05:23.582 --> 02:05:25.217
THEN HAVE DSS COMPLETE A PILOT

02:05:25.284 --> 02:05:26.218
THEM PRESENTED TO THE

02:05:26.285 --> 02:05:28.821
LEGISLATURE IF YOU DECIDED HEY

THIS IS GREAT WE REALLY LIKE TO

02:05:29.788 --> 02:05:30.356
DO IT.

02:05:30.422 --> 02:05:31.991
THEN WE'D HAVE TO RESTART

02:05:32.057 --> 02:05:33.158
PROGRAMS THAT WE ADJUST.

02:05:33.225 --> 02:05:35.394
RAMP DOWN AND OPERATIONALLY WE

02:05:35.461 --> 02:05:36.695
CAN'T OPERATE THAT WAY THAT'S

02:05:36.762 --> 02:05:38.631
NOT A VIABLE WAY TO OPERATE AND

02:05:38.697 --> 02:05:40.232
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF USING.

02:05:40.299 --> 02:05:41.700
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S HOMELESSNESS

02:05:41.767 --> 02:05:43.102
RESOURCES WHICH WE ABSOLUTELY

02:05:43.168 --> 02:05:45.104
SUPPORT SOME SIGNIFICANT CHUNK

02:05:45.170 --> 02:05:46.305
OF THAT GOES TO CITIES WHO DON'T

02:05:46.372 --> 02:05:48.173
HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:49.275

THAT SOMETHING THEY NEED THEY

02:05:58.350 --> 02:06:00.286

FUNDS THAT MIGHT BE USABLE FOR

02:06:05.891 --> 02:06:07.059
RENTAL ASSISTANCE.

02:06:07.126 --> 02:06:08.327
IT'S A GAMBIT AND IT WILL TAKE

02:06:08.394 --> 02:06:11.030
TIME AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL

02:06:11.096 --> 02:06:13.399
KEEP THE PROGRAMS ALIVE.

02:06:13.465 --> 02:06:19.705
OKAY ALL RIGHT -- CONCUR WITH

PULLING ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:06:23.409 --> 02:06:24.109
WAVE AFTER WE'VE BEEN PUTTING

02:06:24.176 --> 02:06:25.744
THESE FAMILIES TOGETHER SO THEY

02:06:25.811 --> 02:06:28.914
CAN AFFORD -- DOLING UNIT.

02:06:28.981 --> 02:06:31.116
TEN I DON'T SEE ANY RAMPING DOWN

02:06:31.183 --> 02:06:32.484
AND AND THE WAY THIS CORNER NOT

02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:34.787
CONTRIBUTE TO OUR EXISTING

02:06:34.853 --> 02:06:38.157
PUBLICIST PROBLEMS SO -- IT

COURSE WE'D LIKE TO SEE A REPORT

PRETTYLOW -- SO THAT'S WEEKEND

02:07:15.728 --> 02:07:17.229
WHEN THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL CAME

02:07:17.296 --> 02:07:18.464
ACROSS FROM THE GOVERNOR AND THE

02:07:18.530 --> 02:07:19.698
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

02:07:19.765 --> 02:07:21.700

MICROPHONE.

02:07:30.542 --> 02:07:32.544
HE MADE A REQUEST FOR TWENTY

02:07:32.611 --> 02:07:34.113
FIVE MILLION IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE --

02:07:34.179 --> 02:07:35.280
ESTIMATING THAT WE NEED IN A

02:07:35.347 --> 02:07:36.648
YEAR WHEN HISTORICALLY WE

02:07:36.715 --> 02:07:37.416
HAVEN'T SPENT THAT KIND OF MONEY

02:07:37.483 --> 02:07:38.250
ARE YOU LOOKING.

02:07:38.317 --> 02:07:41.854
FOR THIS IS A MULTI YEAR --

02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:43.756
ALLOCATION SO THE SO TWO THINGS

02:07:43.822 --> 02:07:44.423
FIRST THIS IS THE RAMP UP PERIOD

02:07:44.490 --> 02:07:45.090
SO YOU CAN'T LOOK AT SORT OF YOU

02:07:45.157 --> 02:07:46.492
CAN'T PROJECT FROM ONE CORNER TO

02:07:46.558 --> 02:07:47.626
THE NEXT.

02:07:47.693 --> 02:07:48.660
A PROGRAM LIKE THIS THAT WE'VE

02:07:48.727 --> 02:07:49.928
RAISED IN THE PAST THE

02:07:49.995 --> 02:07:51.163
TRAJECTORY IS.

02:07:51.230 --> 02:07:53.232
EXPONENTIAL AND SO WE SHOULD

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:54.933
HAVE EXPECTED THAT BY THIS POINT

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:55.534
THERE WOULDN'T BE THAT MUCH

02:07:55.601 --> 02:07:58.670
MONEY LEFT WE'RE WE'VE ASKED FOR

02:07:58.737 --> 02:07:59.471
TWENTY FIVE MILLION WHICH IS AN

02:07:59.538 --> 02:08:01.507
INCREASE OVER THAT THE ORIGINAL

02:08:01.573 --> 02:08:02.174
AMOUNT.

02:08:02.241 --> 02:08:03.409
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO ADD MORE

02:08:03.475 --> 02:08:05.477
COUNTIES BECAUSE ONLY TWELVE

02:08:05.544 --> 02:08:07.212
COUNTIES KOMMER DISSIPATE ALLOW

02:08:07.279 --> 02:08:08.947
EXISTING COUNTIES TO MEET THE

02:08:09.014 --> 02:08:11.316
THOUSAND PERSON BACKLOG SO WE WE

02:08:11.383 --> 02:08:13.185
HAVE ASKED THE LEGISLATURE. FOR

02:08:13.252 --> 02:08:14.253
TWENTY FIVE MILLION WHICH WOULD

02:08:14.319 --> 02:08:16.221
ALLOW US TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM.

02:08:16.288 --> 02:08:17.623
IT'S THE SAME TRAJECTORY IT'S

02:08:17.689 --> 02:08:20.059
VERY SIMILAR TO THE TRAJECTORY

02:08:20.125 --> 02:08:20.726

AND YOU ADDED MONEY SO THAT MORE

02:08:31.170 --> 02:08:32.337
COUNTIES COULD PARTICIPATE.

02:08:32.404 --> 02:08:33.338
AND WE WERE HOPING THAT BRINGING

02:08:33.405 --> 02:08:34.973
FAMILIES HOME WOULD FOLLOW THE

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:36.708
SAME PATTERN.

02:10:31.390 --> 02:10:33.058
TEAM WITHOUT LOSING THE GAINS

02:10:33.125 --> 02:10:36.161

HOW WE CAN BUILD ON WHAT WE

02:11:14.466 --> 02:11:16.134

BUT OTHERS AS WELL -- THAT THAT

02:27:06.717 --> 02:27:08.753
WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER -- IN

02:27:08.819 --> 02:27:10.888
OUR EFFORTS TO CONSOLIDATE THE

02:27:10.955 --> 02:27:12.690
THE SALAS SYSTEMS -- THAT'S A

02:27:12.757 --> 02:27:14.559
MAJOR I. T. EFFORT AND SUCKED UP

02:27:14.625 --> 02:27:16.360
A LOT OF THE I. T. PLANNING BAND

02:27:16.427 --> 02:27:16.994
WITH.

02:27:17.061 --> 02:27:20.198

02:27:20.264 --> 02:27:21.933
FEEDBACK THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TO

02:27:21.999 --> 02:27:23.100
THEM ON A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

02:27:23.167 --> 02:27:26.404
BASIS ON ANY LEGISLATION THAT'S

02:27:26.470 --> 02:27:28.406
MOVING IN THE LEGISLATURE -- WE

02:27:28.472 --> 02:27:30.541
WERE MAKING THE GENERIC COMMENT --

02:27:30.608 --> 02:27:32.176
THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THINGS

02:27:32.243 --> 02:27:34.612
CAN'T BE FIT INTO THE I. T. KIND

02:27:34.679 --> 02:27:36.681
OF PIPELINE IF YOU WILL OR THE

02:27:36.747 --> 02:27:38.382
THE KIND OF TO DO LIST.

02:27:38.449 --> 02:27:40.751
IN A TIMELY MANNER CONSIDERATION

02:27:40.818 --> 02:27:43.120
EITHER SHOULD BE TO ADJUSTING

02:27:43.187 --> 02:27:44.689
IMPLEMENTATION DATES FOR THOSE

02:27:44.755 --> 02:27:46.190
ITEMS TO ALIGN WITH WHAT CAN BE

02:27:46.257 --> 02:27:49.093
AUTOMATED OR CONSIDER MANUAL --

02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:50.428
WORK AROUNDS AND AND FINDING THE

02:27:50.494 --> 02:27:51.729
ADMINISTRATIVE COST OF THOSE

02:27:51.796 --> 02:27:54.098
ACTIVITIES AND OTHER SUCH THINGS

02:27:54.165 --> 02:27:55.900

02:27:55.967 --> 02:27:57.602
PURPOSE AND PERHAPS GET MAKING

02:27:57.668 --> 02:27:59.403
THAT MONEY AVAILABLE ON A MULTI

02:27:59.470 --> 02:28:00.671
YEAR BASIS.

02:28:00.738 --> 02:28:02.006
SO I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD

02:28:02.073 --> 02:28:03.140
WITH SHARING SOME OF THOSE

02:28:03.207 --> 02:28:05.243
CONCERNS SOME CHANGES IN THE

02:28:05.309 --> 02:28:07.078
SYSTEM ARE EASIER A CHANGE TO A

02:28:07.144 --> 02:28:08.846
CAL WORKS GRANT REPLACES NUMBERS

02:28:08.913 --> 02:28:11.349
ON A TABLE AND DOESN'T REQUIRE

02:28:11.415 --> 02:28:12.116
PROGRAMMING.

02:28:12.183 --> 02:28:13.918
BUT NEW BENEFITS OR NEW NEW

02:28:13.985 --> 02:28:15.653
PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES --

02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:16.787
DIFFERENT THINGS REQUIRE

02:28:16.854 --> 02:28:18.289
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUTOMATION

02:28:18.356 --> 02:28:19.824
AND SO WE JUST WANT TO BE ON THE

02:28:19.890 --> 02:28:20.858
ECORD.

02:28:20.925 --> 02:28:22.059
WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY SURPRISED

02:28:22.126 --> 02:28:23.828
IF WE SAY WE CAN'T DO IT FOR TWO

02:28:23.894 --> 02:28:24.762
OR THREE YEARS.

02:28:24.829 --> 02:28:25.730
IT MAY BE BECAUSE THE

02:28:25.796 --> 02:28:27.331
PROGRAMMING IS REALLY COMPLEX

02:28:27.398 --> 02:28:28.666
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN WE

02:28:28.733 --> 02:28:30.067
DON'T THINK IT CAN OR SHOULD BE

02:28:30.134 --> 02:28:31.902
DONE IT JUST MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

02:28:31.969 --> 02:28:34.238
BE DONE IN THE YEAR IN WHICH

02:28:34.305 --> 02:28:35.273
EVERYBODY WANTS IT TO BE DONE.

02:28:35.339 --> 02:28:37.608
OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY THAT

02:28:37.675 --> 02:28:40.177
STATEMENT -- AND I RECOGNIZE SO

02:28:40.244 --> 02:28:41.946
WE HAVE WE TALKED ABOUT WE HAVE

02:28:42.013 --> 02:28:43.347
THIS BIG SAWS INTEGRATION

02:28:43.414 --> 02:28:47.084
PROJECT AS AN END TO WHAT.

02:28:47.151 --> 02:28:47.718
TWENTY TWENTY THREE THANKS GOAL

BEYOND MY TIME HERE IN THE

02:28:49.553 --> 02:28:55.860
LEGISLATURE -- AND IT'S BEEN

02:28:55.926 --> 02:28:58.329
GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME.

02:28:58.396 --> 02:28:59.063
SO AND MAYBE I'M GAS MORE

02:28:59.130 --> 02:28:59.664

02:29:11.776 --> 02:29:14.445
BE NECESSARY TO DO THAT ISN'T.

02:29:14.512 --> 02:29:15.913
ISN'T FITTING IN WITH THE

02:29:15.980 --> 02:29:17.782
CURRENT TIMELINE.

02:29:17.848 --> 02:29:19.250
OUR VIEW AT A YOU MAY MORTGAGE

02:29:19.317 --> 02:29:20.584

EARLIER AND I WAS SIMPLY USING

02:29:31.262 --> 02:29:32.897

02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:51.382
THAT THE CASH OUT POLICY IN SOME

02:29:51.449 --> 02:29:53.317

MUCH WANTS TO BE DONE AND WHAT

02:30:16.207 --> 02:30:18.109

CHALLENGES OF DOING A VERY LARGE

02:30:44.869 --> 02:30:46.670
SYSTEM RIGHT AND EVERY TIME WE

02:30:46.737 --> 02:30:49.373
MAKE A CHANGE HERE SOMEBODY HAS

02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:51.876
TO PROGRAM SOMETHING THERE -- I

02:30:51.942 --> 02:30:53.577

PRIORITIES.

02:30:57.915 --> 02:30:58.616
WE DON'T WANT THE COMPUTER

02:30:58.682 --> 02:31:00.684

EVERYONE HEARS ACTING AND

02:31:19.103 --> 02:31:20.571
SHOULDN'T IN GOOD FAITH AND

02:31:20.638 --> 02:31:22.406
EVERYONE THEN THIS IS AT AND I

02:31:22.473 --> 02:31:23.641

ALSO WANT TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS

02:31:32.817 --> 02:31:34.919
THAT -- THAT WE DON'T MAKE THE

02:31:34.985 --> 02:31:37.154
COMPUTER SYSTEM HAS INTEGRATION

02:31:37.221 --> 02:31:39.423
AN EXCUSE NOT TO DO SOMETHING WE

02:31:39.490 --> 02:31:44.228
SHOULD BE DOING -- SO SITES MY

WHAT IT'S ALL IS I THINK WHAT WE

02:31:53.938 --> 02:31:55.940
NEED TO DO IS AND FOR AND AND

02:31:56.006 --> 02:31:57.441
AGAIN AMERICA AND I SAID I HATE

02:31:57.508 --> 02:31:58.909
I TRUSTS THAT.

02:31:58.976 --> 02:32:00.377
YOUR GOALS WE ARE SHARING THE

02:32:00.444 --> 02:32:01.479
SAME GOALS.

02:32:01.545 --> 02:32:02.947
WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE RIGHT BUT

02:32:03.013 --> 02:32:03.981
I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO BE

02:32:04.048 --> 02:32:06.617
HELPFUL THEN IS THAT.

02:32:06.684 --> 02:32:07.852
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME YOU KNOW

02:32:07.918 --> 02:32:09.019
BE SURE THERE'S THE LEVEL OF

02:32:09.086 --> 02:32:10.921
TRANSPARENCY SO WE KNOW EXACTLY

02:32:10.988 --> 02:32:12.223
WHAT WE SAY.

02:32:12.289 --> 02:32:13.090
WELL THIS IS GONNA BE

02:32:13.157 --> 02:32:15.159
CHALLENGING TO PROGRAM INTO OUR

02:32:15.226 --> 02:32:19.263
COMPUTER SYSTEM.

02:32:19.330 --> 02:32:21.699
THEN.

02:32:21.765 --> 02:32:22.666
WE NEED ARE THEY WITH THE

02:32:22.733 --> 02:32:24.568
LEGISLATURE AND ALEJO NEEDS TO

02:32:24.635 --> 02:32:25.736
KNOW LIKE OKAY WELL IF IT DOES

02:32:25.803 --> 02:32:27.705
ABOUT PRIORITIES THEN WE NEED TO

02:32:27.771 --> 02:32:29.373
KNOW LIKE WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN

02:32:29.440 --> 02:32:30.307
THE BAND THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

02:32:30.374 --> 02:32:30.975
PROGRAM.

02:32:31.041 --> 02:32:33.110
AND WHERE AND AND SO THAT WE

02:32:33.177 --> 02:32:35.045
HAVE A SAY IN TWO WHICH WHAT WE

02:32:35.112 --> 02:32:36.213
THINK ARE THOSE PRIORITIES TOO

02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:38.582
SO I'M SURE THE PROGRAMMERS AND

02:32:38.649 --> 02:32:40.684
SO FORTH ALREADY HAVE A SET OUR

02:32:40.751 --> 02:32:42.353
PRIORITIES BASED ON AND

02:32:42.419 --> 02:32:44.054
STAKEHOLDERS BUT WERE ALSO A

02:32:44.121 --> 02:32:45.623
VERY IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDER SO.

02:32:45.689 --> 02:32:46.957
IF IT IF THAT'S GOING TO BE THE

02:32:47.024 --> 02:32:48.259
REASON THAT WELL WE DON'T WANT

02:32:48.325 --> 02:32:49.260
TO DO THIS NOW BECAUSE OF THE

02:32:49.326 --> 02:32:50.427
HEART PROGRAM THE OF TO TELL US

02:32:50.494 --> 02:32:52.096
LIKE OKAY WELL THESE ARE ALL THE

02:32:52.162 --> 02:32:53.864
THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO AND IF WE

02:32:53.931 --> 02:32:55.132
DID DO THIS NOW WHAT WE GET

02:32:55.199 --> 02:32:55.366
BUMPED.

02:32:55.432 --> 02:32:56.834
OFF A WHAT WE GET BUMPED LATER

02:32:56.901 --> 02:32:58.369
SO WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE

02:32:58.435 --> 02:33:00.137
ACTUAL TRADE OFFS ARE NOT SIMPLY

02:33:00.204 --> 02:33:00.638
THAT.

02:33:00.704 --> 02:33:01.839
WELL THIS IS GONNA BE KIND OF

02:33:01.906 --> 02:33:03.774
HARD TO DO SO I THINK YOU KNOW

02:33:03.841 --> 02:33:05.609
WE NEED THAT LEVEL TRANSPARENCY

02:33:05.676 --> 02:33:07.278
TO UNDERSTAND THE I GUESS THE

02:33:07.344 --> 02:33:09.213
CONSEQUENCES OF ANY DECISION WE

02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:09.480
MAKE ME.

02:33:09.547 --> 02:33:11.882
WE MAY CHOOSE TO DO THOUGH THERE

02:33:11.949 --> 02:33:12.683
MAY BE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION

02:33:12.750 --> 02:33:14.318
BY THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THAT

02:33:14.385 --> 02:33:16.253
PRIORITY THAT'S FINE THAT'S THE

02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:18.188
NORMAL PROCESS WE ALWAYS HAVE.

02:33:18.255 --> 02:33:22.059
BUT I THINK I AM AND IT AGAIN I

02:33:22.126 --> 02:33:22.726
WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH

02:33:22.793 --> 02:33:24.295
BECAUSE I REALLY APPRECIATE OUR

02:33:24.361 --> 02:33:25.763
DIALOGUE -- AND DURING THESE

02:33:25.829 --> 02:33:27.464
BUDGET HEARINGS -- I KNOW

02:33:27.531 --> 02:33:28.766
THEY'RE NOT DONE YET AND FORGET

02:33:28.832 --> 02:33:30.868
APPRECIATE ACTUALLY YOUR PASSION

02:33:30.935 --> 02:33:32.736

02:33:32.803 --> 02:33:33.637
WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP THE

02:33:33.704 --> 02:33:34.972
FAMILY SIDE NO QUESTION ABOUT

02:33:35.039 --> 02:33:35.606
THAT.

02:33:35.673 --> 02:33:37.207
I THINK THAT NOR FOR US TO BE

02:33:37.274 --> 02:33:39.577
ABLE TO PRIORITIZE AND I

02:33:39.643 --> 02:33:40.878
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

02:33:40.945 --> 02:33:42.112
AND I YOU KNOW I'M I UNDERSTAND

02:33:42.179 --> 02:33:43.147
THAT THE BIG COMPUTER SYSTEM

02:33:43.213 --> 02:33:44.548
THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS WE

02:33:44.615 --> 02:33:45.482
GOTTA KEEP THE THING GOING WE

02:33:45.549 --> 02:33:46.917
KNOW WHAT THE THING BEING HELD

02:33:46.984 --> 02:33:47.851
UP FOR YEARS.

02:33:47.918 --> 02:33:48.652
AND DECADES IS AT ONCE LIKE

02:33:48.719 --> 02:33:50.721
DOING STUFF BUT WE NEED TO BE

02:33:50.788 --> 02:33:52.056
PART OF THAT IS WORTH

02:33:52.122 --> 02:33:53.624
CONSIDERING POLICIES WHICH THEN

02:33:53.691 --> 02:34:00.664
WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE

02:34:00.731 --> 02:34:01.432
COMPUTER SYSTEM.

02:34:01.498 --> 02:34:02.499
WE NEED TO KNOW OKAY WE MAKE

02:34:02.566 --> 02:34:03.400
THAT POLICY CHANGE WHAT IMPACT

02:34:03.467 --> 02:34:04.034
DOES IT HAVE ON THE COMPUTER IF

02:34:04.101 --> 02:34:05.002
THAT'S THE REASON WHY THERE'S

02:34:05.069 --> 02:34:06.604
RELUCTANCE. TO DO IT BECAUSE

02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:08.372
WELL IT'S GOING TO SLOW DOWN ITS --

02:34:08.439 --> 02:34:09.573
THERE NEEDS TO BE THAT LEVELS

02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:10.841
TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE THEN WHAT

02:34:10.908 --> 02:34:12.009
CASE WERE PART OF THAT DECISION

02:34:12.076 --> 02:34:13.544
MAKING RIGHT OKAY WE KNOW THE

02:34:13.611 --> 02:34:15.012
TRADE OFF IS IS THAT MEANS WE

02:34:15.079 --> 02:34:16.847
BOUGHT SOMETHING ELSE OFF THAT

02:34:16.914 --> 02:34:18.282
WE THE PEOPLE WANT TO DO.

02:34:18.349 --> 02:34:19.717
WE MAKE THAT DEAL YEAR LATER IF

02:34:19.783 --> 02:34:22.620

02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:24.088
TO RIGHT THAT BUT WE NEED TO BE

02:34:24.154 --> 02:34:25.089

02:34:28.325 --> 02:34:29.893
HOW THAT WORKS THAT MAKES SENSE?

02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:31.495
THE WAY WE MANAGE THE PROJECT WE

02:34:31.562 --> 02:34:33.063

I REALLY DIDN'T WANT THAT

02:34:45.776 --> 02:34:47.444
INTERPRETED AS SO WE CAN'T DO IT
