OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH- LET'S HEAR FROM OUR FIRST AND ONLY AUTHOR OF A SENATOR BATES WELCOME AND- YOU HERE PERCENT SB SIX TO SEVEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND A GOOD MORNING ON MEMBERS I FIRST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF ARE FOR THE TIME AND CONSIDERATION THAT THEY'VE GIVEN US BILLS WHEN OUT THERE FLOATING AROUND SINCE THE NINETEEN UNDER. A DIFFERENT NUMBER BUT- CERTAINLY IT IS THE SAME SB SIX TWENTY SEVEN REQUIRES LOCAL SO COMMISSION AS SET COASTAL ACT. TO GRANT PERMITS TO CITIES COUNTIES AND STATE AGENCIES AN OCEANFRONT HOMEOWNERS OF FOR THE IN SOLUTION INSTALLATION OF COASTAL MITIGATION PROJECTS UNDER CURRENT LAW ANY CONSTRUCTION THAT ALTERS THE SHORELINE MUST RECEIVE A PERMIT FROM THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION OR THE PRESIDING LOCAL GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER RESPONSE TIMES FOR PERMIT APPLICATIONS OFTEN TAKE MONTHS IN SOME CASES YEARS TO APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AS THE DELAY AND RESPONSE TIMES HAS LEFT OUR COASTAL BLUFFS VIRTUALLY UNCHECKED LEAVING BEACH GOERS AND OCEANFRONT HOMEOWNERS VULNERABLE TO THE DANGERS OF COASTAL EROSION. IN RESPONSE TO THESE THREATS SB SIX TWENTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE THE COASTAL COMMISSION TO APPROVE OR DENY AN APPLICATION FOR A COASTAL MITIGATION PROJECTS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF IT SUBMISSION AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT AT THIS POINT TOP. TIER STERN BATCH THAT IS CERTAINLY OPEN TO AMENDMENT BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE ALL WITNESSED IT MANY OF THE AGENCIES THIRTY DAYS OF A VERY SHORT TIME TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH SOMETHING AS COMPLICATED. AS A REQUEST FOR A COASTAL FLOOD MITIGATION PROJECT PERMIT OUT SO WITHOUT FIRMLY OPEN FOR DISCUSSION AND I AM VERY AWARE THAT THAT IS. A LITTLE TOO AGGRESSIVE- TO PUT UPON THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND ITS STAFF. I DID INTRODUCED THIS BILL BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN AT GRAND VIEW BEATEN ANTHONY THIS CALIFORNIA NOT IN MY DISTRICT WHEN AN OCEAN FRONT BLUFF SUDDENLY COLLAPSED AND KILLED THREE MEMBERS OF THE DAVIS FAMILY. WHO HAD GATHERED TO CELEBRATE MRS ELIZABETH COX'S VICTORY OVER BREAST CANCER HOWEVER THIS WASN'T. THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED IN OUR DISTRICT. THE SANTA AREA TRIED FOLLOW SIMILAR PREVENTABLE BY KALAU FATU. IN 959-952-0002 THOUSAND TWO. AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN A CONCRETE TO BEACH WALKWAY NEAR THE BACK OF CAPISTRANO BEACH IN ORANGE COUNTY AND MY DISTRICT. COLLAPSE AS A RESULT OF OCEAN DRIVE IN EROSION. IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN A MAJOR BLUFF COLLAPSE AND DEAL MARK BUT THE ENTIRE COASTAL RAIL LINE IN JEOPARDY. AND WILL NOW COST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO FULLY REPAIR AFTER THE FACT. AND JUST THIS PAST OCTOBER METROLINK WAS ONCE AGAIN IMPACTED ONE PART OF THE RAIL LINE COLLAPSED IN THE CITY OF SAN CLEMENTE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AT RISK IF WE DO NOT ACT. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE PRESIDNT PRO TEM TONI ATKINS AND HER BILL SENATE BILL ONE THAT THE GOVERNOR JUST APPROVED. I SUPPORTED THE BILL BECAUSE IT BRINGS MUCH NEEDED RECOGNITION OF THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE IT PROVIDES VALUABLE TOOLS TO ASSESS. PLAN AND MITIGATE SEA LEVEL RISE. AND ALSO PROVIDES RESOURCES TO DO THE PROJECTS THAT COULD SAVE CALIFORNIA. FROM THE IMPACT OF SEA LEVEL RISE PROJECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AS MUCH AS I VALUE SB ONE THIS BILL IS A MUCH NEEDED COMPLIMENTARY COMPLIMENTARY PIECE. TWO S. B. ONE THAT WILL GIVE US A CHANCE TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE FACING IMMINENT THREATS. WELL THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS PERCEIVED FLAWS IN MY BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED I AM COMMITTED TO MAKING CHANGES NECESSARY. TO AVOID UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO WE DO STAND BY AND WATCH SO WE DON'T STAND BY AND WATCH THE BLUFFS AND BEACHES WASH AWAY WHILE WE WAIT FOR THE PLAN FOR THE S. B. IS PROMISING US. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY THE FIRST IS DOCTOR PAT DAVIS A RESIDENT OF ANTHONY THIS AND THE SECOND IS TIM. BROWN A RESIDENT OF SAN CLEMENTE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SENATOR BATES AND- WILL WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR LEAD WITNESSES- DOCTOR DAVIS- IT'LL BE GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE AND I HOPE YOU'RE WITH US THIS MORNING IF YOU'RE HERE- MODERATOR PLEASE BRING DOCTOR DAVIS ON.

SIX TWENTY SEVEN SPONSORED BY SENATOR BATES. ON AUGUST SECOND OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A DAY AT GRANDVIEW BEACH CELEBRATING MY SISTER-IN-LAW'S VICTORY OVER BREAST CANCER. WE SHATTERED BY A MASSIVE CLIFF COLLAPSE THAT KILLED MY WIFE JULIE. MY DAUGHTER ANNIE AND MY SISTER IN LAW ELIZABETH. THEY'RE ALSO TWELVE CHILDREN FAMILY MEMBERS CLOSE BY COULD HAVE BEEN FATALLY INJURED. THIS TRAGEDY COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED THERE HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVE STUDIES DONE BY THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND MANY OTHER AGENCIES THAT HAVE PROPOSED NUMEROUS SOLUTIONS. STABILIZE THESE DANGEROUS BLOCKS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO MAKE ARE HEAVILY POPULATED BEACHES SAFER. THE GATE THE CITY'S. THE STATE AND COASTAL COMMISSION HAVE NOT ENACTED ANY SOLUTIONS TO MAKE OUR BEACHES SAFE SIR. IT IS TIME THAT LEGISLATIVE ACTION TAKES PLACE. POSTAL RELIGION AND POOR MANAGEMENT OF OUR EXISTING BLOCKS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE OUR BEACHES MORE AND MORE DANGEROUS. THE ACCIDENT THAT HAPPENED TO MY FAMILY WILL HAPPEN AGAIN IF WE DON'T MAKE CHANGES. SB SIX TWENTY SEVEN IS A SOLUTION THAT WILL HELP SAVE LIVES. THANK YOU VERY MUCHFOR HEARING ME. THANK YOU DOCTOR DAVIS- MISTER BROWN ARE YOU WITH US. I AM WELCOME. THANK YOU MY HEART GOES OUT TO DR DAVIS I'M SO SORRY- THIS TERRIBLE TRAGEDY I SPEAK Q. AS- MY NAME IS TIM BROWN AND- GOOD AFTERNOON MR MEMBERS I'M A FORMER MAYOR OF THE CITY ST CLAIR WHERE I SERVED EIGHT YEARS AS CITY COUNCILMAN IN THIS COMMUNITY TODAY HOWEVER SPEAK TO AS A RESIDENT OF SOUTH WEST BANK MANY AN AFFRONT TO DECIPHER SHORE COMMUNITY. OVER THE LAST FORTY FIVE YEARS THIS COMMUNITY HAS WATCHED ALMOST A HUNDRED LINEAL FEET OF BEACH SAND WORKS WITH AN GOING INTO THIS LACK OF SAND THE MASSIVE LANDSLIDES TRIGGERED UNDER THE CLUBHOUSE AND FORGERIES ALL EXTREMELY DANGEROUS FOUNDATIONS CRACKED HOME SPLIT IN HALF TO THE HOMES AT THE RED TAG TO PREVENT GAS- GAS LEAKAGE AND THAT SORT. OF LEAKAGES WHILE. THE SITUATION BECAME MORE. HAS SEPTEMBER WHEN THE RIVER TRACKS LOW. DEBATE SLIDE BOOK LATERAL ALMOST INCHES SHUT DOWN CRITICAL REAL SERVICE FOR SAN. AND ORANGE COUNTY. TO LINK WAS ONLY ABLE TO ADDRESS A SLIP NOT MY- ELEVENTH ALONG THE BEACH. THE BILL SIX SEVENTY TWO WILL PUT CREATE A PROCESS TO EXPEDITE APPLICATIONS FOR SHORELINE PROTECTION BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE CONDITIONS. WOULD APPLY TO SITUATIONSLIKE OURS WHERE THE BLAST SLIPPAGE THREATENS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PEOPLE'S ARMS. AND ULTIMATELY ENDANGERS THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY IT ALSO ALLOWS COAST COMMISSIONER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REQUIRE LANDOWNERS REPLENISHED BAND. YOU KNOW TO THE PROJECT WHICH I BELIEVE IS A GOOD THING SINCE LOSSES AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE ROCHA. THE PASSAGES BILL ONE BY THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM. PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK RESOURCE FOR LONG TERM MITIGATION SEALEVEL RISE AND I BELIEVE SENATOR BATES BILL COMPLEMENT THAT EFFORT BY STOPPING RUSSIAN AREAS. OR THREATS TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY ARE IMMINENT. ONE OF THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE COURSE MICHAEL'S EXPAND PUBLIC ACCESS TO OUR BEACHES WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. TO OUR BEACHES IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY AND ACROSS CALIFORNIA PRINCE REDUCE ACCESS THE BEACHES. ANY ENJOYMENT OF THE OPTIONS FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. BOOKS FAMILY WANT TO VISIT THE BEAUTIFUL CALIFORNIA BEACH AND COASTLINE. IF THAT DOESN'T MEAN SITTING ON REPRAP AS THE OCEAN CRASHES INTO THE ROCKS BELOW THAT. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY AND ASK THAT YOU VOTE BY. ONE SENATE BILL SIX TWENTY SEVEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY MISTER BROWN- WILL NOW- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE GENERAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- DO WE HAVE ANY HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OH THREE I DON'T THINK WE DO- LET'S MOVE.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS KELLY GATHERED SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT SENATE BILL SIX TWENTY SEVEN WILL HELP COASTAL HOMEOWNERS AND COMMUNITIES. AND DESPERATELY NEEDED TIME TO DETERMINE THE DISPOSITION OF HOMES INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER PROPERTIES IN LIGHT OF THE LEVEL RIGHT. NOT THAT THE COMMITTEE RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING THE INSURANCE WHICH WILL PROTECT LIVES AND PROPERTY RESPECTFULLY. REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. OKAY THANKS- GOING FORWARD IS GOING TO SAY NAME AND AFFILIATION HERE ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK WE HAVE- MANY OTHERS IN IN TESTIMONY BUT WHEN YOU DO PRESENT JUST YOUR NAME AND WHETHER YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND WHERE YOU'RE FROM- PUTS MODERATOR LET'S MOVE TO THE NEXT CALLER. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SHARE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. THANK YOU THEY'RE KNOWN FOR THE LINES INTO AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU MR MODERATOR- NOW WE HAVE HEARD FROM ALL SUPPORTERS WERE GONNA START SAME PROCESS FROM OPPOSITION- I BELIEVE OUR LEAD OPPOSITION THIS MORNING IS- SIR CHRISTIE WITH THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION AS WELL AS LAURA WALSH WITH SURFRIDER FOUNDATION- MISS CHRISTY DO YOU WANT TO. TAKE THE LEAD HERE. SURE I THINK YOU COULD BRING HERE STERN MEMBERS I'M SURE CHRISTY WITH THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION WHICH IS VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO OPPOSE THIS MEASURE. WITHOUT QUESTION EVERYONE HAS EACH OF THE DEEPER THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO SUSTAIN THIS TERRIBLE LOSS MADE IT SUFFERED A HEARTBREAKING TRAGEDY AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THEY WANT TO CHANNEL. THEIR GRIEF INTO ACTION. BUT WE MUSTN'T CONFLATE THAT TERRIBLE TRAGEDY WITH THE BILL BEFORE YOU WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATE STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER SHORELINE ARMORING TO PROTECT PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT. IT'S NOT NECESSARY IT WILL PREVENT SIMILAR EVENTS AND IT WILL HAVE DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON EACH IS PUBLIC ACCESS IN CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL ECONOMY. LET'S BE CLEAR IT'S NOT AS IF THE INGREDIENTS PLUS GAVE WAY BECAUSE THE COMMISSION DENIED A RETAINING WALL THERE. THE COMMISSION IS NEVER RECEIVED ANY SUCH APPLICATION AT THAT SITE YOUR HAS THE COMMISSION EVER DENIED A PRIVACY WALL IN THE GENERAL AREA. IN FACT BECAUSE NATIVE BLASTS ARE ALREADY EXTENSIVELY ARMOR- ACCIDENT WAS JUST THAT. ACCIDENT NOT THE RESULT OF ANY. POLICY OR FAILURE TO ACT. BUT STILL WILL BE THE MORE SEAWALLS INCLUDING REPRAP WHICH MEANS MORE COASTAL EROSION NOT LATCH THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR HE WON'T KILL BEACHES BY CUTTING OFF THE CENTRAL ST SUPPLIED. AS BEACHES SHRINK WAIT ENERGY ON NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES INTENSIFIED HE WILL DEFINITELY HAVE THEIR PLACE IN SOME SITUATIONS CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES UP. THE CAN PROVIDE IMMEDIATE SHORT TERM PROTECTION WHILE OTHER SOLUTIONS ARE- ARRIVED ON BUT IT CALIFORNIA'S DEADLY TOWARDS SCIENCE BASED LONG RANGE REGIONAL PLANNING IN NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS MEANWHILE SHOULD BE. A LAST RESORT NOT THE DEFAULT. I T. WOLVES BECAUSE ELDER FOR ENOUGH ONE CUMULATIVE COST WILL QUICKLY OVER YOUR- FOR. I SIX TWENTY SEVEN THE SCALE IN FAVOR OF C. WALLS REGARDLESS OF OTHER OPTIONS. THE COMMISSION AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD HAVE TO APPROVE THEM BY RIGHT FOR ANY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS BELT BEFORE MAY OF LAST YEAR. DISCRETION TO DENY WOULD BE SEVERELY CONSTRAINED IT LIMITS MITIGATION TO THE FEET OF NO MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A LOCALLY IN ADEQUATE AMOUNTS THAT WILL NOT ADDRESS ACTUAL IMPACT. IF WEALTHY COAST LIKE POLICIES WILL MAKE IT FASTER EASIER AND CHEAPER TO BUILD THE WALL. BUT IT WILL BE AT THE COST OF PUBLIC BEACHES. THANK YOU MR CHRISTIE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PRACTICE TO MONEY THAT BE GREAT THANK YOU WE ASK YOU THE- PORTABILITY COMMITTEE TODAY RESPECTFULLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE THAT MS WALSH. I THANK YOU IN THE MORNING CARE TURNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE BAR LOS WITH THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION. I'D ALSO LIKE TO RECOGNIZE THAT ALL OF A THREE SPEAKING BECAUSE WE CHERISH THE BEACH WE ALL HAVE REALLY IMPORTANT MEMORIES THERE. THE GOOD TO GREAT AND ALSO THE TERRIBLE AND I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR EVERYONE. BACK HERE IN THE NEW YEAR TRYING TO PROTECT WHAT THEY LOVE FROM VERY REAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEVEL RIDE. UNFORTUNATELY BILL IS NOT A SHELTER WE SEEK. THE BILL ATTEMPTS TO TRADE A STATE BEACH FOR THE BEACH ITSELF. BY FAST TRACKING SEA WALLS THAT NARROW BEACHES. A STATE NATIONAL PARK IS NOT ONE PAVED OVER WITH ASPHALT. IT'S ONE EFFECTIVELY MANAGED AND CURATED. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR OUR LOCAL BLOOD AND BEACHES. I UNDERSTAND PUBLIC ALLOW THE BILL AND HILLARY ROAD AGAIN AND- OUT A BILLABLE SPACE THAT EVER MORE VULNERABLE TO EROSION AND WAVERUNNER. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT NOTHING CAN DONE. CALIFORNIA CODE STANDS TO BENEFIT ENORMOUSLY FROM THE WORK THAT THIS LEGISLATURE ACHIEVE JUST IN THE LAST SESSION. MORE THAN A FEW MEANINGFUL BILL INCLUDING AT THE ONE EIGHTY SIXTY SIX AND EIGHTY SEVENTY TWO ARE IN THE PROCESS OF GOING INTO A FACT THAT WILL MAKE BLOOD CLAP MORE PREDICTABLE. AND BRIDGES ACROSS THE STATE MORE DOCTORS TO CLIMATE IMPACTS INCLUDING C. LEVEL RISE AND ROSHEN. THESE MEASURES ALL HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON. THEY BUILD OFF THE C. LEVEL RISE PRINCIPLES THAT MORE THAN A DOZEN STATE AGENCIES SIGNED LAST YEAR WHICH COMMITS MORE ADAPTIVE AND EQUITABLE PLANNING ALONG THE COASTLINE. AND DELEGITIMIZE IMPORTANT VOTER APPROVED INITIATIVES LIKE THE COASTAL ACT AND BE GLAD. WHICH HELP KEEP THE BEAT A VIBRANT. AND ACCESSIBLE RESORT TO ENJOY. THIS BILL MOVES THE DIRECTION. LET COMMITTEE RECEIVED MORE THAN ELEVEN HUNDRED EMAILS OPPOSING A SIMILAR VERSION OF THE BILL. BECAUSE IT CONTRADICTS THE PROGRESS BEING MADE TO PROTECT OUR COASTLINE. WITH C. LEVEL EXPECTED DRIVE HALF OF THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY. THE STATE REALLY CANNOT AFFORD TO DRIFT AWAY FROM ATTRACTED PLANNING. WEEKEND ARGUED COMMITTEE TO OPPOSE THE BILL INSTEAD FOCUS ON COASTAL RESILIENCE STRATEGIES IN TWENTY TWENTY TO THAT BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS WELCH- NO MORE LEAD WITNESSES- DO WE HAVE ANY HEARING FORTY TWO OH THREE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION NO- MODERATOR WILL TURN TO THE LINES- AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ON OUR TELECONFERENCE ARVEST WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION- JUST NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. THANK YOU TO JOIN THE QUEUE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY DONE SO PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE. AGAIN THAT'S ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO.

SEVENTEEN GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MONOCLE FOR ON BEHALF OF DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE CALLING IN OPPOSITION THE BILL. THANK YOU. NEXT OUR OUR FINAL LINING WAS. ONE FOURTEEN ONE FOUR. ON THIS IS SANTIAGO JESUS OF CALIFORNIANS I'M INTO VOTING IN OPPOSITION OF SB SIX TWENTY SEVEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT LINES IN Q. OKAY. WHAT I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OUR SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES- AND BEFORE BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS I DID WANT TO. ESPECIALLY THANK DR DAVIS- YOU KNOW WE SPOKE AT LENGTH LAST YEAR WHEN- THIS BILL WAS FIRST BROUGHT TO COMMITTEE. AND- NOT JUST THIS BILL BUT- THE TRAGEDY THAT- YOUR FAMILY EXPERIENCED IN THAT- MANY OTHER CALIFORNIA'S HAVE WE DON'T ALWAYS REALIZE THIS HI I WENT THROUGH SOMETHING SIMILAR WITH A- CLOSE FRIEND GROWING UP- MUCH FURTHER SOUTH I MEAN MUCH FURTHER NORTH BUT- SAME KIND OF. HORRIBLE TRAGEDY AND I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT- I THINK ALL YOUR ADVOCACY IN YOUR BRAVERY IN SHARING YOUR FAMILY STORY AND REPEATING THAT. TRAUMA OVER AND OVER AGAIN HAS YIELDED INCREDIBLY POWERFUL ACTION I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR FROM SOME MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH THEIR ATKINS ARE PETRIE-NORRIS OR YEARS ELLIS ADVOCATE HERE IN CENTER BATES. BUT ALSO FEDERAL ACTION IS PENDING WITH THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS LOOKING AT A- A BEACH NOURISHMENT PROJECT- AND LOOKING AT A LONG TERM PLAN FOR THAT ENTIRE REGION- I THINK THAT YOUR VOICE IS BEING HEARD- WELL BEYOND YOUR COMMUNITY AND I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR IT. I'M SORRY THAT- WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THE SAME BILL WE HAD A PRESENTED TO THE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE. ON A BEACH REPLENISHMENT AND IN CERTAIN- TARGETED CIRCUMSTANCES SHORELINE PROTECTIVE DEVICES MAY MAKE SENSE- BUT THE SORT OF. HEAVY HANDED IN- SINGLE SHOT APPROACH TO THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE. TO ME POSES SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS FOR EXACTLY THE REASONS WE'RE HERE TO SOLVE- WHEN IT COMES TO- ONE RIVET REVETMENT FOR SHORELINE PROTECTIVE DEVICE BEING PUT IN ONE AREA WHAT HAPPENS TO THE AREA RIGHT NEXT TO THAT. DEVICE DOES THIS THE SAND GETS SUCKED AWAY AND- PULLED SOMEWHERE ELSE WE'VE SEEN NUMEROUS STUDIES ON THAT THE PROLIFERATION OF SEA WALLS WITHOUT INDICATED INADEQUATE. MANY MEDICATION WITHOUT A PROCESS FOR COASTAL COMMISSION FOR STATE AGENCIES THROUGH SEQUEL TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS- SEEMS TO ME A RASH APPROACH TO A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT SHOT NOT BE- RUSH THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT INSTEAD DELIBERATED ON SO. YOU KNOW I DO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE LEAD SOLUTION I WISH WE ATTACK- DONE REAL WORK HERE AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO WORK WITH WITHIN THE EXISTING STATUTORY FRAMEWORK THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR SO- THOSE ARE MY INITIAL COMMENTS I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY- BUT I DO THINK THERE'S SERIOUS WORK TO GET DONE. BOTH WITHIN THE FEDERAL ARMY CORPS FRAMEWORK IN THE THREE BILLS PASSED LAST YEAR BUT I WOULD OPEN IT UP TO. FURTHER DISCUSSION OR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS MEMBERS- CERTAINLY DO APPRECIATE ANY FEEDBACK- YES CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU CENTER BATES- THE OBVIOUS I LIVE NEARBY THIS SITUATION AND YOUR DISTRICT BUT I'M NOT TOO FAR AWAY MYSELF AND I REMEMBER. THE NEWS THAT'S US REMEMBER SEVERAL YEARS AGO- THAT THIS LEGISLATURE TOOK UP SOME ISSUES REGARDING BALCONIES WHEN THERE WAS SOME BALCONY COLLAPSES IN- IN- BERKELEY AND- THE LEGISLATURE ACTED QUICKLY- THERE WAS A LOT OF DEBATE ON. WHETHER THE ACTUAL LEGISLATION WAS GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT- THE BOTTOM LINE WAS THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE TO ACT QUICKLY AND PASS SOME LEGISLATION. THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT AND I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE TODAY HAS AN OPTION TO SAME THING IN THIS SITUATION- AND YOU KNOW THE COULD THE COASTAL COMMISSION. MY UNDERSTANDING THEIR CHARTERS TO PROTECT THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA. AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COASTAL COMMISSION TO STEP UP AND TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS. AND ACTUALLY- RATHER THAN JUST. A COME OUT AGAINST THIS BILL WITH. MAY BE A PROPER ARGUMENTS ARE NOT PROPER ARGUMENTS WILL LEAVE THAT FOR FURTHER DEBATE AS THE CHAIRMAN. HI COMMENTED BUT- TO JUST COME OUT OUT OUT OF OUT OF HAND. TO OPPOSE THIS- SEEMS AGAINST THE CHARTER AND THE PURPOSE OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION IN THE FIRST PLACE I MEAN THEIR THEIR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE COAST AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT- I KNOW I JUST WONDER IF. THOSE COASTAL RIDGELINES WERE POPULATED BY ENDANGERED SPECIES HOW MUCH WOULD THE COASTAL COMMISSION APPROVED TO PROTECT THAT RATHER THAN- WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE TODAY SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND MAKE THE MOTION FOR APPROVAL AND- HOPE THAT- ENOUGH MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL- FOLLOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR- COME HERE CENTER HUESO AND THEN OVER TO CENTER THERE. OF THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL. THE THANK YOU MISTER AND THANK YOU SENATOR WORKS ON I THINK THE DEBATE- ME LIES A LITTLE WHAT THE ACTUAL SITUATION IS AND IF THERE WAS A BALCONY BILLS STRENGTHENING ONE BALCONY DIDN'T AUTOMATICALLY WE CAN THE NEXT BALCONY THAT IS WHAT IS IN FRONT OF US HERE AND WHAT IS IN FRONT OF US HERE. IS THE FACT THAT THIS IS DE FACTO BY BROUGHT. UP FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF FORMER. AND I HAVE A LENGTHY COASTAL DISTRICT ALONG THE COAST AND IT'S- IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE IS ONE PLACE WHERE THERE IS A STRONG SEA WALL. AND AS A RESULT THE RESIDENTIAL APARTMENT THAT IS RIGHT NEARBY HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY UNDERMINED AND THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROTECT ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE PARK MEANT. BECAUSE THE SEQUEL HAS SHIFTED. OUT OF WHAT THE PROTECTION REALLY IS AND SO TO GO TO OUR BY RIGHT SYSTEM. THAT DOES NOT ANALYZE WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE THAT ARE SO CLOSE TOGETHER IS NOT GOING TO BE HELPFUL IN ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM AND I THINK THAT. THE HI PAUL THIS SENATOR FOR RAISING THE ISSUE. AND ARE ARE AND I'M REALLY SORRY FOR THE SITUATION- THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TESTIMONY. THE QUESTION IS DOES THE SOLUTION MATCH OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND I THINK IT'S THE CONCEPT THAT IS A PROBLEM WHICH IS ANY BY RIGHT THAT DOESN'T SORT OF ANALYZE. THE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS THAT ACTUALLY EXIST IN THE MOMENT AND WE HAVE ONE. IN OUR AREA WHERE. WHEN THEY BUILT SANTA CRUZ HARD. IN IN IN WHAT. THEY HAD TO BILL OUT APARTMENTS ON POSOF TO PROTECTED COMING IN AND WHAT IT REALLY DID. IS IT TOOK THIS BEAUTIFUL EXPANSIVE BEACH ON ONE SIDE IN THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ AND- IT HAS COME BACK IN THE POLLUTION IS COMING AT THAT NEIGHBORHOOD MUCH CLOSER. AND THEN THE BEACH ON THE OTHER SIDE WHICH WAS MUCH CLOSER HAS NOW EXPANDED WAY OUT. IN AND THAT IS THE NET EFFECT THAT HAPPENS. WITH SEQUELS. IN ORDER TO WORK WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL YEARS AGO WE- WE HAVE A ROUGH TIME BECAUSE IN SANTA CRUZ THERE'S TWO MILES OF RESIDENTIAL PEOPLE ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE NOTION AND WE HAD TO PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED DISASTERS IN THAT PERIOD FOR ROSHEN. AND IT STARTED TO GO TO STREETS AND STARTED TO GET AT WHAT WAS GOING TO BE THE HOMES. AND WE NO CHOICE BUT TO PUT RIPRAP IN ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE THERE. BUT THE HEAD OF THE LOCAL MARINE SCIENCES PROGRAM GARY GRIGGS. HAS BEEN WELL KNOWN AN OCEAN WORLD FOR FIFTY YEARS. TESTIFIED TO US. I JUST NEED TO TELL YOU MOTHER NATURE ALWAYS WINS NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO MOTHER NATURE ALWAYS WINS SO YOU CAN THINK THAT YOU'RE PROTECTING. YOU'RE REARRANGING THE PROBLEM. IS POSTPONING THE INEVITABLE AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE A SITUATION LIKE THAT. IT DOESN'T CALL FOR ABSOLUTES IN LEGISLATION IT CALLS FOR LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS AND TRYING TO PASS PROTECTED IF THERE'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILES OF PROTECTIONS. THE LONGER CALIFORNIA COAST ELEVEN HUNDRED MILES THEN THAT STATES THAT THAT WAS THE BEST PROTECTION THERE AND THIS IS ONLY GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO GET MORE SERIOUS IT IS ONLY IF WE- IF WE HAVE SEA LEVEL RISE THAT'S TWO OR THREE. FEET BETWEEN NOW AND THE TURN OF THE NEXT CENTURY. IT IS NOT JUST THAT THAT IS A GRADUAL RISE IT IS THE EXTREME EVENTS. IS EXTREME EVENTS THAT DRIVE HOME. ABOUT RISE AND SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IT'S THE REASON WE PASSED SB ONE LAST YEAR BUT I JUST DON'T THINK THE BY RIGHT SYSTEM FOR COASTAL ARMORING ITS DISSOLUTION AND I WILL BE NOT SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. OKAY THANK YOU SIR FOR THE CON. IN THE AND THE COMMENTS AS CENTER HUESO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE CENTER LIVE FOR THOSE COMMENTS AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK THEY WERE RIGHT ON POINT AND HE GETS TO MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ON THE COAST COMMISSION OURSELVES APPOINTED OVER TWELVE YEARS AGO. AND BACK THEN WE WERE HAVING REGULAR MEETINGS ON THE ISSUE OF SEA LEVEL RISE AND HOW THE CLOSE COMMISSION COULD START TO ENACT POLICIES TO COMBAT THAT THAT WELL THAT'S BEEN. MANY YEARS IN THE PROCESS SAID EVEN PREDATED MY SERVICE. ON THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A PROCESS AS QUICKLY PEOPLE TO. THE PROBLEM. A LITTLE KNOWN FACT ABOUT CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE HIGHEST POINT GEOGRAPHICALLY CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES MOUNT WHITNEY AND THE LOWEST POINT BACK WATER BASIN THAT ARE EIGHTY MILES APART. AND IT SPEAKS TO CALIFORNIA'S OF THE REASON WHY THAT WERE THE GOLDEN STATE RIGHT CHIU THIS IS GEOGRAPHIC MARVEL BUT IT ALSO SPEAKS TO A LOT OF SEISMIC ACTIVITY. A LOT OF CHANGES HAPPEN HAVE HAPPENED IN OUR STATE'S COASTLINE ALL AROUND STATE. AND OVER THE YEARS NOT ONLY IN THE COAST BUT EVEN INLAND AND ALONG RIVER BODIES ALONG- GROUND THAT IS NOT. VERY STABLE WE HAVE BUILT A LOT OF HOUSING. THAT IS BECAUSE OF NORMA'S AMOUNT OF DAMAGE AND ACCIDENTS. AND TODAY WE'RE MAKING CORRECT TURKEY TAKING CORRECTIVE ACTION NOT ONLY IN THE COAST FOR CROSS STATE AND THIS IS ONE OF THE- THE CONSEQUENCES OF. NOT BEING COMPLETELY THOROUGH IN OUR EVALUATION WHERE IT'S SAFEST TO BUILD IN THE STATE. SO MIKE MY CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY THAT ARE OF SOFT SUFFERED- CORBEL ACCIDENTS AS A RESULT OF THIS. IT AFFECTS OUR TRANSPORTATION AFFECTS FAMILIES LIVES. BUT I RECOMMEND THAT IN THIS FOR I MEAN THIS THIS BILL I AGREE- TRIES TO TAKE IN ORDER TO AGGRESSIVE ACTION TO CORRECT SOMETHING ONLY IN THE SHORT TERM MORE THIS THAT WE HAVE TO. BE MORE THOUGHTFUL AND COME UP WITH A LONGER TERM SOLUTION THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO GIVE US THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE INVESTMENT. THAT'LL HELP US SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT CENTER LOOP LEAD DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF LOOKING UP. AT A COMPLETE LOOK AT OUR OCEAN AND LOOK AT PROJECT BY PROJECT I RECOMMEND. THAT THROUGH YOUR TRANSACTION TO OUR ACTION HERE THAT WE WORK WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND CITY LEADERS TO PROPOSE I HEARD THERE WERE SOME SOLUTIONS THAT- WERE PROPOSED BY THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS IF THEY REALLY HAVE SOME SOLUTIONS THEY SHOULD BE. PROPOSED THEY SHOULD BE PUT IN FRONT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN FRONT OF THE COSTA COMMISSION AND WE SHOULD START WORKING ON INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS THAT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IN A WAY THAT DON'T EXACERBATED I BELIEVE THIS LAW WILL EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM STATEWIDE. THEY MIGHT BE A GOOD LAW IN THE CASE FOR INSULATORS MAYBE THIS ONE PROJECT BUT IT WILL DEFINITELY CAUSE A REVERSAL OF SOME THE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE LIKEWISE AND STUDYING HOW TO ADDRESS ADDRESS THIS- SAT AT A STATE WIDE. LEVEL BUT INDIVIDUALLY NOTHING PREVENTS THE CITY OF ENCINITAS OR ANY PROPERTY OWNER OR ANY ENTITY IN PARTICULAR FOR PROPOSING THE PROJECT INCLUDING THROUGH YOUR ADVOCACY WORKING WITH YOUR LOCAL LEADERS AND SOME OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO PROPOSE SOME OF THESE- IMPROVEMENTS TAKE SOME OF THOSE SUB UP PROPOSALS FOR SOME OF THOSE IDEAS AT THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS HAVE. HAVE COME UP WITH AND PUT THEM INTO A PRACTICAL SOLUTION. AND APPLY DIRECTLY THROUGH THE- REGULAR PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE TO. PEOPLE'S PROPERTY AND LIVES ARE PROTECTED IN OUR COASTLINE. IS ALSO PROTECTED IN IN ITS ENTIRETY SO- ARE ENCOURAGED YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT I HAVE I PLEDGE YEARS ADVOCACY FOR YOUR DISTRICT AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU REPRESENT. AND HOPE THAT YOU CAN- MAYBE COME AT THIS PROBLEM FROM A MORE DIRECTION LUCIEN WORKING WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU CENTER- ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS- I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY QUESTIONS THE AUTHOR- BUT I WOULD ALLOW YOU THERE'S BEEN SOME COMMENTS MADE IN YOUR CLOTHES PERHAPS YOU WANT TO. RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE- OR TAKE WHATEVER TIME YOU WANTED TO CLOSE AT IDC CENTER ALLEN OUT THERE AS WELL BUT- I'LL JUST I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE AUTHOR IF THAT'S OKAY. THANK YOU CHAIRMANSTERN AND THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR. THE DISCUSSION. I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU JUST VERY QUICKLY THE R. E. I WILL CALL IT THE EVOLUTION OF US SENATOR BATES SO GETTING. INTO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. WINNOW THE TRAGEDY OCCURRED AND HENCE THE NEED IS AND CERTAINLY THERE WERE. MANY THREATS BEFORE THAT THAT I. THE WEARER OF BEING A ALL COASTAL RESIDENTS. BUT I LOOKED AT CHAPTER THREE ARTICLE FOUR OF THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL ACT. WHICH SPECIFICALLY IF THERE'S A BY RIGHT IS CONTAINED IN THAT SECTION ON THREE OH TWO THREE FIVE I BELIEVE IT IS. WHERE IT SAYS REVETMENTS BREAKWATERS GROWING HARBOR CHANNEL C. WEALTH CLICK RETAINING WALL SHALL. SHALL BE PERMITTED WHEN REQUIRED TO SERVE COASTAL DEPENDENT USES. OR TO PROTECT EXISTING STRUCTURES ARE PUBLIC. BEACHES AND DANGER OF EROSION. SO I LOOK AT THAT I THOUGHT I WAS WITH. WORK AND WE WERE LOOKING OUT LAW. AND INTERPRETATION THE COUNTY LEVEL AND I WAS A TRAINER AT THAT TIME FOR MY UNIT- WE LEARNED THAT THE TERM SHALL IN STATE LAW AND SHALL IN IS NOT DISCRETIONARY. SO WHEN I SAW SHALL I THOUGHT WOW HERE'S AN APT IN THE COAL ACT AND PROVISION OF SUCH SHALL SELENE BY RIGHT WAS NOT CREATED BY SB SIX TWENTY SEVEN HE WAS ALREADY IN THE COASTAL OUT SUBSEQUENT TO AMENDMENTS. AND CERTAINLY CHANGES OVER TIME WITH THE WITH THE TERM EXISTING STRUCTURE. AND THAT HAS BEEN DEFINED AS ANYTHING BEFORE I THINK OF DEAL TO NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HOWEVER PASSED NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN. THE COASTAL COMMISSION DID APPROVE OF DEVELOPMENT OF STRUCTURES IN PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE SUBSEQUENT TO THAT TIME. SO THERE'S STILL A LITTLE DEBATE ABOUT EXISTING I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT EXISTING STRUCTURE OF BILLS THAT ARE NATURALLY CREATED STRUCTURES WHICH HAPPEN TO BE THE BLUFF. THOSE ARE NATURAL GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURES ALONG THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA IN MANY CALLS FOR A OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND CERTAINLY IN THE WORLD. SO TO ME WHEN I LOOKED AT THE OFTEN I'M TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT CAN WE DO TO US. TO ACCELERATE- SOLUTIONS THAT WE ARE SEEING THEIR AMOUNTING OVER ON C. LEVEL RISE AND AN ADDITIONAL CONSTRUCTION BASICALLY OF PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE HARBORS CHANNEL FOR BOTH CONTRIBUTE. DAMMING RIVERS CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOSS OF SOUND NOT JUST SEE WHAT. WE KNOW THAT FROM THE EVIDENCE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. SO IT SEEMS LOGICAL THAT WE WOULD BRING THIS FORWARD SO I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION I THINK IT OPENS UP A BROADER DISCUSSION OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE NEAR TERM AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHAT. SENATOR HUESO SAID ABOUT TRYING TO GET SOMETHING THAT IS HIM ON THE MERCHANT. CAN SOLVE THAT RIGHT NOW IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE LIFE AND CERTAINLY FOR BEACH ACCESS. FOR THE PUBLIC IN THE LONGER TERM ABSOLUTELY WE'VE GOT TO FIND A LONGER TERM SOLUTION THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS VERY TEDIOUS- PERMIT PROCESS LOCAL FULL COMMISSION HAS TO DEAL WITH AND I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY FOR THEM. TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE FOR THE EACH AND EVERY APPLICANT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S A LOT HERE I DO BELIEVE THAT CAN CONTINUE DISCUSSION I CERTAINLY WILL TAKE THAT ON. BUT YOU YOU KNOW THAT I FEEL VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS AND I DO THINK IN THE COASTAL ACT IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA. NEEDS A DEEPER DIVE INTO WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANT AND I KNOW THEY'RE BEING COURT CASES TAKING LOOK AT BACK. STILL IT DOES NOT DISCUSSION GOING ON BUT I DO THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT STRUCTURES AS SOMETHING THAT INCLUDES BLUFF. NOT JUST PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND NOT JUST PRIVATE PROPERTY STRUCTURES. SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN PROTECT OUR COLLECTIVE POLICY TO PROVIDE US YOU ALL ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE CHANCE THAT THEY HAVE OVER THEIR SLOPES. SO THERE IS A RELATION THAT GOES DOWN AND HELPS REPLENISH BUT IT DOESN'T FALL DOWN ON CARS AND PEOPLE AND BEACH GOERS. SO WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AND CERTAINLY WITH SB ONE.
