AFTERNOON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY 2% AB THREE THIRTY WHICH WILL EXPAND FUNDING FOR THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL. SARGENT SHRIVER CIVIL COUNCIL ACT PROGRAMS WHICH WERE ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT UNDER GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER. THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE VITAL LEGAL REPRESENTATION TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS IN POTENTIALLY LIFE CHANGING LOOK CIVIL LEGAL MATTERS. INVOLVING BASIC HUMAN NEEDS AND HELP TO ENSURE THAT OTHERWISE ON REPRESENTED PARTIES HAVE MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN THE MOST PROFOUND AND HIGH STAKES CASES. INCLUDING CHILD CUSTODY AND HOUSING RELATED MATTERS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL RELEASED AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF THE PILOT PROGRAMS CONDUCTED BY AN OUTSIDE RESEARCH FIRM. THE STUDY FOUND THAT SHOULD THE SHRIVER PILOT PROJECTS IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR LITIGANTS INCREASE SETTLEMENTS REDUCE COURT COSTS AND ENABLE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO PROCESS CASES MORE FAIRLY AND EFFICIENTLY. AB THREE THIRTY SIX TO EXPAND THE REACH OF THESE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS BY MODESTLY INCREASING THE FILING FEES THAT FUND THE PROGRAM AND MAKING MINOR ELIGIBILITY CHANGES SUGGESTED BY THE EVALUATION. IN SO DOING AB THREE THIRTY WILL HELP MORE PHONE NUMBER CALIFORNIANS SECURE ACCESS TO JUSTICE SAVE TAXPAYER RESOURCES IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND FAIRNESS OF OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM. AND BUILD UPON A PROGRAM THAT HAS PROVEN EFFECTIVE BY RIGOROUS INDEPENDENT EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS. FOR THESE REASONS AB THREE THIRTY ENJOYED STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY HAS NO OPPOSITION AND HAS BEEN ENDORSED BY A BROAD ALLIANCE OF LEGAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS AND SPECIALISTS AND THE LOS ANGELES TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE THIRTY IS SELENA COUPLED WITH THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND SKIP KOENIG WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEGAL SERVICES OF LA COUNTY. THANK YOU AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST HER AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND WITNESSES -- TWO MINUTES EACH. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SKIP CANTICUM DIRECTOR POLICY ADVOCACY NEIGHBORHOOD LEGAL SERVICES VALLEY COUNTY. WE'RE ALL PAINFULLY AWARE OF THE GROWING HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN LA WE SAW ARE HOMELESS POPULATION INCREASED BY 16% THIS PAST YEAR WITHIN THE CITY AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE'VE HOUSED OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE LAST YEAR. BECAUSE WE KNOW WE CAN'T BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THE CRISIS WE HAVE TO ATTACK IT FROM ALL ANGLES IN THE SHRIVER CIVIL COUNCIL ACT AS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS. TO STEM THE INFLOW INTO HOMELESSNESS BY WORKING TO KEEP. KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR EXISTING HOMES. THE SHRIVER PROGRAM PROVIDES LEGAL SERVICES IN CRITICAL AREAS AFFECTING BASIC HUMAN NEEDS SUCH AS HOUSING CHILD CUSTODY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND GUARDIANSHIP. THE DRIVER PROGRAM THAT AN LS ADMINISTERS FOCUSES ON EVICTION CASES OUT OF THE STANLEY MOSS CAUGHT HALF COURT HOUSE IN LA. WHICH IS THE HIGHEST VOLUME EVICTION CASES IN THE LARGEST COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY. AS THE LEAD AGENCY FOR THE DRIVER HOUSING PROJECT WE SEE POWER IMBALANCE AN EVICTION CASES EVERY DAY OR ONLY 10% OF TENANTS ARE CURRENTLY REPRESENTED AS COMPARED 290% OF LANDLORDS. THROUGH THE SUCCESS OF THE STRIVE A PROGRAM WE SEEN THAT COUNSEL HAVE A CHANCE OF AVOIDING HOMELESSNESS. AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COUNSEL ONE OF OUR CLIENTS A SINGLE MOTHER CARING FOR A DAUGHTER AND AN ARTISTIC GRANDSON. LIVED IN A RENT CONTROLLED UNIT FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AS A RESULT OF A CASCADE OF MISFORTUNE SHE SUFFERED A STROKE LOST HER JOB AND FELL BEHIND IN A RENT. THE STRIVE RETURNEES OBTAINED. OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PAY HER BACK RENT AND GO SHE IS A SETTLEMENT SO THAT SHE AND HER FAMILY WERE ABLE TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOME. AND THEIR RENT CONTROL TENDENCY WAS REINSTATED IN ULL WITHOUT RISK LEGAL REPRESENTATION YOU CAN IMAGINE THE DEVASTATION OF FICTION IMPOSSIBLE HOMELESSNESS WOULD HAVE HAD ON OUR CLIENT. ALTHOUGH WE'VE HOUSE MORE WE'RE LOSING THE BATTLE BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE ARE FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS AS A RESULT OF A FICTION WE HAVE TO SHUT OFF THE SPIGOT. WE KNOW KEEPING PEOPLE HOUSES ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS AND PROVIDING COUNSEL TO THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. IN LA 63% REPORTED FALLING FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH 53% CITING FINANCIAL REASONS AS THE BECAUSE THE SHRIVER PROGRAM HAS PROVEN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED WITHIN INCREASE OF FUNDING WE CAN PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES TO MORE LOW INCOME AND UNDERSERVED. FAMILIES AND HELPS THEM THE TIDE OF DISPLACEMENT AND HOMELESSNESS THANK YOU. VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS TWO MINUTES PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SELLING A COUPLE AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND OUR ORGANIZATION WAS ACTUALLY REALLY INSTRUMENTAL IN PASSING THE REGIONAL A. B. FIVE NINETY SO OUR ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS RIDER PROJECTS. INCLUDING FOR THE BEGINNING COORDINATING PROJECTS AND HELPING TO TRAIN THE NEW CORPS OF HOUSING ATTORNEYS -- BUT I PERSONALLY AM INVOLVED IN A DIFFERENT WAY I SERVE ON THE SCHREIBER SELECTION COMMITTEE SO I REVIEW APPLICANTS FOR FOR NEW GRANTS AS THEY COME IN. AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT WE CEASE COURSE SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS MORE IN REQUEST FOR FUNDING THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PUSH OUT SO -- WE SUPPORT EIGHTY THREE THIRTY BECAUSE THIS ACTUAL MAKE US BE ABLE TO APPROVE MORE GRANT APPLICATIONS -- MY ORGANIZATION SUPPORTS INCREASED FUNDING FOR LEGAL AID OF COURSE -- AND YOUR THROUGH EQUAL ACCESS FUND AND OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING BUT WHAT IS REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THE SCHREIBER PILOT PROJECTS AS THE EVALUATION PIECE. BECAUSE PROGRAMS WERE BUILT FROM THE BEGINNING TO HAVE EVALUATION IS A CORE COMPONENT THEY'RE ABLE TO TEST OUT -- DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS TO TESTING OUT MEDIATION AND OTHER OTHER INTERVENTIONS TO SEE WHAT THAT MEANS AFTER THE CASE IS CLOSED. AND THE EVALUATORS ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP WITH CLIENTS AFTER THE FACT TO SEE WHAT ACTUALLY CHANGES IN THAT PERSON'S LIFE. AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF OUTCOME DATA WHICH YOU DON'T TPICALLY GET FROM LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO A CLIENT SIX MONTHS LATER -- BECAUSE OF THE THE EVALUATION PIECE WE HAVE A REALLY AMAZING CLIENT STRIES ARE GOING TO SHARE VERY BRIEFLY SOME EXAMPLES FROM LEGAL AID FOUNDATION SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WHO'S WHO OF THE SHARED PERMISSION. TO GIVE ME PERMISSION TO SHARE THE STORY -- DID THAT THIS IS A REALLY GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW SHRIVER HELPS PEOPLE WHO ARE IN TRUE LIFE CRISES. AND IN ONE EXAMPLE THERE WAS A WOMAN WHO IS PREGNANT WITH TWINS AND SHE PASSED AWAY WHILE PREGNANT AND THE TWINSWERE DELIVERED POSTMORTEM AND THE HOSPITAL RUSH THEM TO THE HOSPITAL SEVERAL HOURS AWAY AND THE FAMILY WAS UNABLE TO GET ANY INFORMATION. ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THESE BABIES THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES YOU KNOW HOW THEY WERE DOING AND THE HOSPITAL WOULDN'T GIVE THEM ANY INFORMATION AND SO HOW LEGALLY FOUNDATIONS IN A PROPER STEPPED IN AS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET. IT INITIALLY JUST GET INFORMATION ON THAT THE THE STATUS OF THE CHILDREN AND HELP THE FAMILY GET A TEMPORARY GUARDIANSHIP SO COULD HAVE GUARDIANSHIP OVER THE INFANTS. AND YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT THIS IS A LEGAL A PROBLEM BUT LEGALLY STEPS IN WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS AND THERE IS A LEGAL HOOK THERE'S ALL THESE WAYS THAT GUARDIAN SHIPS AND HOUSING. ATTORNEYS CAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ENTHUSIASM AS WELL AS YOUR TESTIMONY ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS ITEM. IF YOU WOULD JUST STEP FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE WITH YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON AVI LEVY ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS I WANT TO THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL. FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE WE TALKED ABOUT IF THERE'S NY TWEAKING TO BE DONE AT ANY POINT -- COUPLE THINGS IN HERE THAT I UNDERSTAND YOU YOU WOULD BE RECEPTIVE TO BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY -- INTEGRAL TO THE TO THE VALUE OF THIS BILL. AND I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE HAVE THAT ACCESS TO JUSTICE WHICH YOU REPRESENT IN WHICH IS A PRIORITY SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORK WITH THE WITH THE FOUNDATION AND THE ALL RIGHT I CERTAINLY YEAH I THINK THIS IS. IMPORTANT IN HELPING OUR LOWER INCOME FOLKS -- OBTAIN JUSTICE OF THANK YOU FOR THE BILL AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS-SENATOR STERN. EGGMAN CHAIR. I DON'T APPLY THE AUTHOR AND THOSE OUT THERE DOING THE WORK I KNOW YOU DO THIS WORK YOURSELF -- TO I HAD THE CHANCE TO BE A LEGAL AID INVESTIGATOR ACTUALLY BEFORE LAW SCHOOL. AND MY ONLY CONCERN WITH HIS MEASURES JUST NOT ENOUGH. RIGHT I THINK IT'S SO GOOD THAT YOU'RE GONNA MAKE THIS IMPACT BUT DO YOU CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF EVEN IF WE GET THIS DONE. HOW HOW BIG IS THIS CIVIL GIDEON GAP STILL GOING TO BE BECAUSE EVERY PERSON WE LEAVE BEHIND AND TO BECOME A HUGE COST IN THE SYSTEM AS IT IS RIGHT I MEAN? TO ME FALLS AND HOMELESSNESS IS GOING TO COST US. SO MUCH MORE IN THE BACK AND SAID DO YOU HAVE A SNSE OF HOW HOW MUCH WE CAN BITE INTO THE PROBLEM HERE AND YEAH WOMAN YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR FOR YOUR COMMENTS ARE FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL PERSONAL RECORD ON THIS I THINK. YOU KNOW FOR ME THIS REPRESENTS. A LOT OF HOW I THINK POLICY MAKING SHOULD BE DONE WHICH IS WE DID A PILOT PROGRAM THERE WAS AN A RIGOROUS EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS IT. REPORTED REALLY GOOD OUTCOMES ACROSS THE BOARD BOTH FOR THE FOLKS WHO ARE REPRESENTED AT THE LITIGANTS THEMSELVES AND ALSO FOR THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WE'RE NOT GONNA MOVE HOPEFULLY TO DRAMATICALLY EXPAND THE PROGRAM BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN THAT RIGOROUS EVALUATION ANALYSIS AND SO HOPEFULLY. pYEARS FROM NOW THAT THIS ISN'T SUFFICIENT TO GET THE JOB DONE WE CAN COME BACK AND CONTINUE TO MAKE TWEAKS TO THE PROGRAM SO. WE CERTAINLY HAVE OUR EYE ON HELPING AS MANY FOLKS AS POSSIBLE AND MAKING SURE THAT ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY IN THE STATE WITHOUT REGARD TO WEALTH -- BUT WE WANT TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT IS -- THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE OF AND BASED ON EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH AND DATA ABSOLUTELY WHAT IF THERE IS A TWO WEEK OR REMAIN IN THE FUTURE PLEASE CONSIDER ADDING ME AS A CO AUTHOR LOVES PORCH ON THIS EFFORT AND YEAH I APPRECIATE THE METRICS DRIVEN APPROACH TO BECAUSE I THINK. THE OUTCOMES ARE THERE RIGHT I MEAN THE DATE HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THANK FOR THE THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I TO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- AS YOUR MIND THIS OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE. NO CITY ATTORNEY FEWER. CARRIED I THINK THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS. I'D LIKE THE REFERENCE TO THE CIVIL GIDEON -- BUT MY QUESTION GOES KIND OF THE SAME AREAS MY COLLEAGUE HERE. IN ALSO. I ALL TO FIND HELP CAN I ALSO FUNDS BE USED TO SUPPORT ON THE AISLE TO FUNDS BEING TRUST FUNDS IN ATTORNEY TRUST ACCOUNTS THE THE INTEREST EARNS GOES. TO LEGAL AID GROUPS CAN HAD IS THAT MONEY -- CAN IT BE USED TO SUPPORT THIS. THIS WORK. OR IS THAT MORE GENERAL PROGRAM SUPPORT MONEY. EITHER -- WELL SENATOR THE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION THE I. ALL TO FUNDS DOES DOES GO TO SERVE LEGAL AID IN GENERAL AND SO FOR INSTANCE OUR ORGANIZATION NEIGHBORS LEGAL SERVICES VALLEY COUNTY -- GET A GOOD CHUNK OF OUR BUDGET COMES FROM THE AYE ALL TO FUNDS IT'S NOT NECESSARILY -- WE CAN'T USE IT FOR THE TREVOR PROJECT SO WE USE IT FOR OTHER SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE A LOT OF THEM INCLUDE -- HOUSING CASES -- AS WELL AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT -- DOVE TAILING TO WHAT THE DRIVER PROGRAM DOES BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT SET OF LAWYERS IT'S A DIFFERENT. BUCKET OUT OF WHICH WE GET THE FUNDS THE FUNDING FOR THIS BANK YOU APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION AND DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING FURTHER JUST ALLEGED ADDITIONAL ANSWER IS I'LL TO SPEND SOME OF ALL THE TILE OF OVER THE PAST SEVRAL DECADES THERE'S BEEN UPS AND DOWNS AND WAY UPS AND THEN. CRASHES TO YOUR LESS THAN FOUR MILLION A YEAR AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE STEPPED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO PROVIDE OTHER -- STABLE FUNDING FOR LEGAL AID AND SHRIVER'S ONE OF THOSE RESPONSES BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S DONE INCLUDING INCREASING CO ACCESS FUNDS. AS STABILIZE THE FUNDING BECAUSE IT DOES I'LL TO DISCUSS THIS THANK YOU -- IN AGAIN I THINK. THE PARALLEL IS. YOU THE RIGHT TO HELP ACCESS WE WE ESTABLISH A RIGHT BUT THEN WE LOOK AT IMPLEMENTATION AND DEPENDS ON ACCESS AND RURAL AREAS ACCESS TO POOR PEOPLE ACCESS TO UNDOCUMENTED. IN IN THE LEGAL ARENA WE CAN ESTABLISH CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS BUT THEY DON'T GET FULLY REALIZED PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE. THE RIGHT TO REPRESENTATION SO. THANK YOU FOR THE WORK I'D BE GLAD TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU CENTER MONEY. US SENATOR BOARD JUST. I TOO WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND -- THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT IN MY PREVIOUS CAPACITY AS A SUPERVISOR. WE HAD -- A NUMBER OF DISCUSSIONS ON WITH THE OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE JUDICIARY ON THE COSTS THAT -- ARE BEING -- DEVELOPED WITH THE VARIOUS FEES AND WHATNOT AND I THINK. I BELIEVE MY AREA WILL BENEFIT FOR THIS PROGRAM. THE CHALLENGE THOUGH IS THAT THE DOLLARS ATTACHED TO IT -- THE COMING FROM INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY NOT INITIALLY DRIVE TO BENEFIT FROM IT SO I THINK. YOU'RE FINDING IN A SITUATION WHERE I IN MY BACKYARD I HAD ALREADY HAD THIS DEBATE ON HOW TO GET COSTS LOWER -- WITHIN THE FILING FEES -- EVEN THOUGH WE'RE AND DERIVE A HUGE BUT IT BENEFITS SO I'M GONNA LAY OFF BUT I DO COMMEND YOU I THINK THIS WILL HAVE SOME HELPFUL -- CONTRIBUTIONS ON TO THOSE THE IN THE SO I COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR WORK. PARDEE COURSE NOTING THAT MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES IT HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU JUST WANT TO THANK THE THE SENATORS FOR THEIR IF THEY'RE THOUGHTFUL FEEDBACK AND COMMENTS JUST TO YOUR POINTS IN A MINING I DID WANT TO NOTE THAT. ONE OF THE TWO WEEKS WE MAKE IN THIS BILL AS WE AUTHORIZE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO ACCEPT VOLUNTARY DONATIONS FROM PUBLIC OR PRIVATE ENTITIES. WE'VE HAD SOME -- THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH FOLKS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHO ARE OF THE HAVE SEEN THE EVIDENCE IN THE RESEARCH ON THIS PROGRAM AND HOW EFFECTIVE IT'S BEEN IN MIKE THEMSELVES WANT. TO FIND A WAY TO STEP UP AND CONTRIBUTE SO WE ARE TRYING TO THINK YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT TO SENATOR BOARD DISS COMMENTS ABOUT. OUR THEIR STREAMS OF FINDING OUT THERE THAT WE CAN USE TO SUPPORT THIS VERY. WORTHY WORK -- AND AND ALSO THE OTHER WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE AND WITH THAT WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND I DID NOTE IN AN ARTICLE IN TODAY'S PAPER. THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE IN THE FEDERAL TAX LAW HAVE SERVED TO DISCOURAGE CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE AND I HOPE AT SOME POINT WE CAN TURN THAT AROUND SO. PROGRAMS LIKE THIS CAN BENEFIT FROM THE GENEROSITY OF THOSE WHO HAVE. OF THE MONEY TO GIVE SO WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR MONNING IT IS A MOTION TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO AB THREE THIRTY JACKSON. JACKSON AYE BORDERS [inaudible] TO RUSSELL. RUSSELL I GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I'D JONES [inaudible] MONNING. I STERN. STERN I AM BURKE.

EITHER DO IT HERE ACTUALLY WAS THINKING I MIGHT DO IN YOUR IN THE FLOOR. BUT AS BY AGREEMENT WITH THE POLICY WHEN WHICH IS TO ACCEPT THAT IS AN AUTHORS AMENDMENT AND AND TEAR IS OPPOSITION MY APOLOGIES WE DO HAVE OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL -- AND IT'S STATED IN THE ANALYSIS MY MY APOLOGIES FOLKS SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD. THIS IS -- AB. SIX TWENTY SORRY ON THE ISSUE OF OPPOSITION I DO WANT TO SAY THAT WITH THIS CHANGE IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE COURT ASSOCIATION HAS TO INDICATE THEY WILL REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION SO THIS ONE WORD CHANGE WAS IMPORTANT OF THEM -- AND WE THINK A SUMMER ACTION FOR THE STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION BUT HAVE NOT HEARD THAT. WILL PERHAPS THEY'RE HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS THEIR POSITION THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. VERY GOOD. SO THIS MEASURE RELATES TO A TOPIC KNOWN AS SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH IN CHILDHOOD. AND A TOUCH THE OF WINCHELL FAMILY OF MY DISTRICT SONYA WINCHELL'S HERE. LOST HER SON NIKO. A CAME HOME ONE NIGHT ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WENT TO BED. ANA AND THE NEXT MORNING SLEEPING IN A WIN AND A ROUSING WHEN HE PASSED AWAY IN THE NIGHT. A COMPLETE MYSTERY AS TO WHAT WENT ON THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE A PERSON'S INFORMED OF THE ADVISABILITY. PARTING TISSUE SAMPLES WHICH IS SIMILAR TO WHAT IS DONE WITH OF SIDS SUDDEN EXPLAIN DEATH IN CHILDHOOD. I WILL NOTE THAT THE SCIENCE OF GENETICS HAS GROWN BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS SINCE THE SAID STATUE WAS ADOPTED. AND WAS SEEM LIKE A GOOD IDEA IN THOSE DAYS WHEN SO LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT GENETICS. A TODAY WE'RE JOINED BY DOCTOR. TEST CAN OF WHO IS A GENETICIST WHOSE ASSIST THE WINCHELL FAMILY SO SHE'LL BE OFFERING. TESTIMONY ANA [inaudible] SO.

ARE CURRENTLY IN ANY CASE WERE AN INFANT ON THE AGE OF TWELVE MOST. IN THE SUSPECTED CAUSE OF JESS'S SIDS SUDDEN. INFANT DEATH SYNDROME. EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THE CORNER NOTIFY THE CHILD'S PARENTS THE IMPORTS OF TAKING TISSUE SAMPLES FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. THAT DOES NOT APPLY TO SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED DEATH IN CHILDHOOD. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE FELLOW GOVERNOR SHE PASSED A STATUTE IN THIS AREA. SUDDEN INFANT DEATH DID AND HAS AN AWARENESS ACT. TO INCREASE AWARENESS AND PROMOTE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CAUSES FOR KIDS OLDER THAN TWELVE MONTHS. AND SO ACTUALLY THIS URGING PARENTS TO GET THIS TISSUE SAMPLE ALIGNS WITH THAT FEDERAL ENACTMENT TO GET BETTER INFORMATION -- SO AB SEARCH TWENTY DEFIES ON THE FOR IN DEPTH IN CHILDHOOD A STATUTE. REQUIRES CORNERS AND FOR THE PARENTS OF A CHILD WHO DIES IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING TISSUE SAMPLES. AND AS I SAY WITH THE CEMENT BUT THERE WAS A QUESTION IN THE PRIOR COMMITTEE OF WHETHER THE BILL COULD MANDATE. THAT SUDDEN INFANT DEATH IN CHILDHOOD BE ENTERED AS A CAUSE OF DEATH ON A TEST FOR TO FORGET. IT'S NOT OUR BELIEF THAT THE BILL EVEN AS INTRODUCED WOULD PROVIDE FOR THAT. AND WITH THIS. CHANGE THAT WE ARE OFFERING TODAY THE IT COMPLETELY ELIMINATES ACT CONCERNED. SO HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS SONYA WINCHELL -- AND THEN DOCTOR TESCO SO -- MS WINCHELL WANT TO OPEN UP THANK YOU AND IF YOU WOULD TWO MINUTES FOR EACH WITNESS THANK YOU MEMORY THIS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

IN CALIFORNIA MOST FAMILIES WHO ARE VICTIMS OF ISSUE YOU SEE ARE LEFT WITHOUT ANY ABILITY TO FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF THEIR CHILD'S DEATH.

THE HARVESTING OF DNA TISSUES CURRENTLY DONE FOR INFANTS UNDER AGE ONE WHY DON'T CHILDREN OVER AGE ONE NOT MERIT THE SAME CONSIDERATION WITH THE PASSING OF NICO'S BILL AB SIX TWENTY YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF ALL CHILDREN BY EATING RESEARCHERS THANK YOU.

THIS BILL BRINGS THE CHOICE INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE REST OF THE STATE BY SAYING THAT THEY CAN HAVE REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS ON AB USE SUCH AS DESIGN REVIEW WITH LREADY SO THEY CAN LOOK LIKE THE REST OF THEIR EACH AWAY IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT. BUT CAN'T JUST BLANKET STOP THEM OR MAKES -- REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SO ON REASONABLE BUT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE FOR PEOPLE TO BUILD THEM WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF RESIDENTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT THEY WANT TO DO AN EIGHTY YOU BUT THEIR H. AWAY AND THERE CITY ALLOWS IT. BUT THEIR H. AWAY IS NOT ALLOWING IT SO THIS BILL DOES BRINGS HUAC COMPLIANCE WITH THE SAME AS ANY MUNICIPALITY. I'M ALLOW FOR EIGHTY USED TO BE CREATED IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WE WITH ME TODAY IS DAVID JONES IS REPRESENTING THE TOWN OF TRUCKEE THANK YOU. THE NOON I HOPE IT'S NOT AS HARD IN TRUCKEE IS IT IS HERE AND IF IT IS WERE ALL IN BIG TROUBLE SO HE'LL BE THERE IN THREE MINUTES EXCELLENT. THEY MINUTES PLEASE TWO MINUTES THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME -- TO TO TO PRESENT TODAY ON BEHALF TOWN TRUCKEE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR WORKING WITH US -- WEEKS BENT OVER BACKWARDS WITH THE OPPOSITION -- THE THAT CONCERNED ABOUT IT THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS PASSED WITH ZERO NO VOTES THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS -- THE BILL DOES TRY TO BALANCE PROPERTY RIGHTS THOSE OF THE EXISTING H. AWAY AND THE OWNERS OF THESE INDIVIDUAL -- HOMES FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN EIGHTY YOU -- SO WE LOOKED VERY CAREFULLY AND TRIED. TO BE AS CAREFUL AS POSSIBLE TO ADD TO RESPECT ANY OF THE H. AWAY LAWS THAT WE THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE SO. DESIGN REVIEW ASCETICS FIFTY FIVE AN OLDER THE EIGHTY YOU WOULD NOT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THOSE SAME RULES SO WE TRIED AS BEST WE CAN AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK WE HAVE OF CRAFTED BILL THAT IS A VERY WELL CRAFTED -- FOR FOR YOU TODAY WE FOLLOWED THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME -- EIGHT EIGHT TWO WAYS -- THE LEGISLATURE SAW IN ITS WISDOM TO ALLOW. THE H. AWAY PEOPLE TO HAVE SOLAR EVEY CHARGING STATIONS AND WATER CONSERVATION AND WE THINK PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS AS MERITORIOUS IS THOSE SINCE OF WITH THAT WE ASK FOR NIGHT OF YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SAYS THE MATTER NOT LIKE HAS PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA U. M. B. AND SB AT HOME IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND I MIGHT NOTE FOR THE RECORD THAT THERE WAS OPPOSITION THAT CAME FROM THE BOARD OF THE SAN LORENZO VILLAGE HOMES ASSOCIATION. BUT THAT THE LETTER. DID WE WERE NOT MADE AWARE OF THE LETTER TILL AFTER PUBLICATION OF THE ANALYSIS SO. WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS OPPOSITION FROM THE RELEASED EXPRESSED WRITTEN OPPOSITION FROM A COUPLE. OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS -- BUT THERE IS NO OPPOSITION HERE. ALRIGHT WITH THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS AND I JUST WANT. TO OF THANK YOU AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WE WILL HAVE A MOTION -- OBVIOUSLY WITH OUR HOUSING CRISIS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS -- THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND I I LIKE MANY OF YOU RESPECT H. AWAY HIS RIGHTS TO TRY TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN CONTROLS WITHIN THEIR ASSOCIATIONS. BUT THIS BILL I THINK MEECH SO THAT DAD BALANCE NICELY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T IMPOSE ANY RULES ON A CHOICE THAT ARE ALREADY IN EXISTENCE. AND IT STILL ALLOWS H. R. WAYS TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR COMMUNITY IT JUST THAT THE DOES ALLOW THEM TO PROHIBIT H. AWAY SIN -- I THINK THAT'S OF THE VERY ELEGANT THE SOLUTION AND APPRECIATE YOUR DOING THAT SO -- IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MANAGER AND THANK YOU SO MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND PLEASE INDULGE MY MY ANXIETIES I KNOW -- WE DO HAVE A CRISIS ON OUR HANDS -- JUST WALK CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH BRIEFLY IN TERMS OF THE LIKE WHAT WHAT AN EFFECTIVE PROHIBITION WOULD BE VERSES SOME REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS I KNOW I I RESERVE THE THIS ISSUE IN THE HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES. IF THEY'RE SORT OF PUBLIC SAFETY -- LEGITIMATE PUBLIC SAFETY INTERESTS ABOUT. HOW MANY CARS YOU CAN GET OFF OF ONE CANYON ROAD AT A TIME? OR SOME OTHER SORT OF WHAT THE VIN OUNCES BECAUSE A REASONABLE RESTRICTION HOW DOES HOW DOES THAT LINE LOOK TO YOU WILL THERE BE SOME DISCRETION WITH THE H. O. WAYS TO SORT OF PURSUE THAT. THAT KIND OF RESTRICTION IS THAT HOW YOU ANTICIPATE IS BEING IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THAT IT'S WRITTEN I USUALLY I'M NOT SURE THAT H. ALWAYS THEMSELVES ARE THE ONES THAT ARE -- MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY THEY TEND TO REGULATE THINGS THAT ARE MORE LIKE A STATICS. SO WOULD TYPICALLY BE MORE OF YOUR MUNICIPALITY OR YOUR FIRE MARSHAL THAT MIGHT LOOK AT HEALTH AND SAFETY AND I WOULD ASSUME THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT. THEY CAN STOP DEVELOPMENT IN GENERAL BASED ON CERTAIN TYPES OF A SEVERITY OF OF A PUBLIC SAFETY THREATS WHETHER IT'S A THREAT OF A LOT OF A MUD SLIDE OR SOME OTHER THREAT THEY MIGHT JUST SAY LISTEN WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO ALLOW MORE DEVELOPMENT IN A CERTAIN AREA. BUT THAT'S NOT AN H. ALWAYS PLEASED TO MAKE THAT KIND OF DETERMINATION H. ALWAYS ARE TYPICALLY REGULATING. YOU KNOW OF DESIGN THE REGULATING CERTAIN SETBACKS AND USUALLY WITH AN EYE TOWARD SORT OF A STATIC SO MAINTAINING PROPERTY VALUES. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS SO IN THEORY IF THE IF THE HI FIRE SEVERITY ZONE CITY OR COUNTY. IMPOSE SOME LOCAL ORDINANCE LIKE THAT SOME RESTRICTION ON DEVELOPMENT IN THE WE WE ARE IN THE HIGH FIRES VERY SOUNDS WHICH I KNOW IT'S BEEN A BIG ISSUE FOR THE CHAIR AS WELL. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY. THAT WOULD TRUMP THAT I WOULD OKAY SO THE AGE WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SAY NO TO THAT AND IT'S IN YOUR SAYING IT'S NOT EVEN REALLY IN THEIR PURVIEW I DON'T THINK IT'S WITHIN THEIR PURVIEW EVER TO TRUMP SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY'RE NOT THEY ARE NOT A CITY -- THEY HAVE CERTAIN TYPES OF DISCRETIONARY APPROVAL I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THE JOYS OF YOU CAN. YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD APPROVED DEVELOPMENT -- I THINK THAT WE STILL HAVE TO HAVE AN UNDERLYING PLAN FROM THE MUNICIPALITY -- IT IS IS MY YOU KNOW GAS SO WE DON'T TRUMP ANY STATE LAW THAT THAT REGULATES. THE PROHIBITION OF BUILDING BECAUSE OF SAFETY THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT THIS IS JUST SAYING H. AWAYIS BASED ON SORT OF THEIR OWN INTERNAL. METRICS OF WHAT THEY THINK IS ALLOWABLE THEY THEY CAN DO A LOT pTO IT TO EIGHTY IS BASED ON THOSE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. WE HAVE A MOTION BY. SENATOR BORCHERS ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WILL ACCEPT YOUR VARIOUS TWO COMMENTS AS MY CLOTHES AND RESPECTFUL QUEST MEMBERS MARCH I LIKE THAT.

CASKEY I EIGHT ZERO EIGHT TWO ZERO THAT BILL IS OUT THANK YOU -- EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME CENTER ON BURKE IS NOT HERE SO WHAT WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN BUT CLEARLY YOU HAVE THE VOTES. VERY GOOD AND THERE YOU HAVE ONE OTHER ITEM OF FILE ITEM. TEN THE AB ELEVEN TEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN -- PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU I'M AB. ELEVEN TEN SIX TO HELP RENTERS -- GIVE THEM SOME A SMALL MEASURE OF RELIEF WHEN IT COMES TO NOTICING REQUIREMENTS FOR RENT INCREASES SO THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE UNIVERSE PEOPLE CAN STILL HAVE THEIR RENTS RAIDS BUT WHAT IT DOES IS IT SAYS IT USE THE POLITIES. WILL BE ABLE TO REQUIRE -- Là -- LONGER NOTICING PERIODS FOR JUROR DRAMATIC RENT INCREASES WHICH WILL GIVE RENTERS MORE TIME TO FIND A NEW PLACE TO LIVE TO PREPARE TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A SITUATION IN GLENDALE WHERE WE'RE SEEING ONE IN TWO HUNDRED PER SOMETIMES 2100% RENT INCREASES. AND THE HOME OF THE RENTER'S MONTHS ONLY HAVE ONE MONTH BEFORE THEY HAVE TO MOVE OUT SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT INCLUDED WOULD PROPOSE RENT INCREASES ABOVE 10% UP 215% WOULD GET A NEW NINETY DAY NOTICE. AND FOR RENT INCREASES OF MORE THAN 50% A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY NOTICE WILL BE REQUIRED. THIS ISN'T SO MUCH ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON YOUR TO YOUR THOUGH IT WILL AFFECT THEM BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF BUILDINGS IN MY COMMUNITY THEY DON'T OFFER YOUR TO LOSE YOUR LEASES THAT ONLY OFFER MONTH TO MONTH LEASES FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD RATHER HAVE A YEAR. TO YEAR FOR THOSE PEOPLE HAVING OTHER RENTS INCREASED A NOTICE JUST IS NOT ENOUGH TIME SO WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THIS -- BILL IT'S THE SPONSORS THE CITY OF GLENDALE AND WITH THAT -- DAVE JONES IS STILL HERE IS NO LONGER FROM TRUCKEE TO THESE FROM GLENDA AT NOW IS FROM GLENDALE SO HE'S GOING. TO RIGHT VERY GOOD FROM GLENDALE FEW OF TWO MINUTES THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING IT WE HAVE CRISIS GOING ON THE STATE OF A LOT OF PEOPLE -- NEAR HOMELESS GIVE THEM MORE OPTIONS A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD TO STAY IN THE PLACE THAT THEY'RE IN -- WE THINK THAT THIS IS A A VERY SMART THING FOR US TO DO AND SO WE'RE SPONSORING THE BILL AND ASK FOR LIVE UP. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU TO STEP UP. I'M SURE MEMBERS RAND MORE NOW BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT TO THE DIET SENATOR BORCHERS. JUST ONE UNDERSTAND. THE SEQUENCE OF TIME SO IF IT IS. IF IT'S 10% OR LESS. THEN IT'S THIRTY DAYS. I BELIEVE SO IT'S WHATEVER THE CURRENT THE OTHER CURRENT LAW THAN THIRTY THAT'S THE COULD THE THAT THAT'S THE CURRENT LAW -- YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT. IF IT'S GREATER THAN 10% LESS THAN -- FIFTEEN KNOWS REQUIRED NO LATER THAN NINETY DAYS THE ACT. OF ITS 10% BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN BECAUSE THE NINETY RIGHT. SHE SAID DO YOU CHANGE THE NATIONAL THIRTY DAY PERIOD. NOW SO IF THEY'RE ONLY RAISING IT LET'S SAY 7% IT'S STILL THE THIRTY DAYS THEY GET THEY ARE. THIRTY THIRTY DAY NOTICE MINIMUM THAT THERE'S GONNA BE A RENT INCREASE SO COULD SOMEONE DO. NINE AND IN HAVE ITALY TRIGGERED THE SIX OR THE TWO MONTH PERIOD -- BECAUSE IT'S CALCULATED ON A CUMULATIVE CUMULATIVE BASIS BASED IN THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS. THEY GET BECAUSE YOU YOU ADD OR YOU CAN'T SURE CUT IT NOW OKAY -- AND IF IT'S MORE THAN THAT THAT'LL BE A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. IS THERE. A MATHEMATICAL -- UNCENSORED ECONOMIC RATIONALE WHY NINETY IS INSUFFICIENT ONE TWENTY IS. JUST THAT IF YOU'RE INCREASING SOMEONE'S RENT A 100% THEY'RE GOING TO NEED MORE TIME SOMETIMES TO FIND THEY THEY MIGHT. THERE'S LESS CHANCE THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PAY THE 100% INCREASE SO THERE'S MORE CHANCE OF THEM HAVING TO MOVE YOUR BE 15% OR MORE. ABOVE FIFTY WITH YOU THAT'S A HUNDRED I MEAN THAT THAT I AGREE I TOTALLY GET THAT BY INTUITION BUT I MEAN IF IT'S A 15%. FIFTEEN OR MORE PERCENT JUMP WITH A LOOP THROUGH THE CHAIR SIR THROUGH THE CHAIR. SEC YEAH JUST THAT WE THINK THAT BECAUSE THERE'S LESS HANCE AT THAT POINT THAT THE RENTERS GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN THE SAME ACCOMMODATIONS WE WANTED TO GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT THAT THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO MOVE. AND GIVE THEM AS MUCH TIME AS WE THOUGHT WAS REASONABLE WITHOUT BEING PUNITIVE TO THE PROPERTY OWNER. THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE OUT AND SO WE WANT TO GIVE THEM MORE TIME TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE -- YOU KNOW IN PLACES LIKE LOS ANGELES IT'S SO HARD TO FIND YOU KNOW. REASONABLE I WOULD SAY REASONABLE BUT FIND RENTS AT THAT SAME PACE SO WE HAVE WE HAVE COMPLAINTS DOZENS OF COMPLAINTS EVERY WEEK. MY RENT WAS YOU KNOW INCREASE TO WHERE I CAN'T PAY IT I'M CAN GIVEN THIRTY DAYS TO MOVE OUT AND THIS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME THAT CYCLE THROUGH ON CRAIG'S LIST YOU KNOW KIND OF EVERY THIRTY DAYS YOU START SEEING THE NEW LISTINGS. THEY JUST NEEDED THEY NEEDED MORE TIME TO FIND A PLACE TO LIVE SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO MOVE OUT OF THE THE AREA COMPLETELY YOUR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATOR TO RAZA -- I THANK THE AUTHOR VERY MUCH -- WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE EDGE. A BECOMING HOMELESS. WE RARELY TALK ABOUT THEM. AND THAT'S REALLY KIND OF WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. IS THAT WATCHING OUT FOR THOSE PEOPLE I KNOW IN LA COUNTY ALONE. THERE ARE SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. OF SEVERELY OVER BURDENED. HOUSEHOLDS THAT CAN PAY THE RENT FOR THEIR PAIN ARE THE I THINK THAT'S 50% OF THEIR INCOME. SEOUL MORE AND MORE AND MORE FAMILIES ARE ON THE BRINK OF THAT AND I GUESS THIS IS THE VERY LEAST THAT WE CAN DO WHICH IS ALLOW THEM TIME TO FIND. MAYBE THE RIGHT STREET THAT THEY'RE GONNA PUT UP THE TENT. OR YOU KNOW LIVE IN SOMEBODY'S LIVING ROOM OR SLEEP ON THE COUCH OR SOMETHING. SO -- I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I HOPE THIS LEADS TO OTHER -- MEASURES THAT ARE FAR MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE ON THE ON THE EDGE. YEAH AND SOMETIMES FOR PEOPLE GIVING THEM TIME TO NAVIGATE OTHER RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE OUT THERE. WHETHER IT'S SHELTERS ARE OTHER AID OR PORTABLE HOUSING THIS GIVES HIM A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME AND HOPEFULLY THAT EXTRA MONTH COULD YOU KNOW IT POTENTIALLY COULD KEEP SOMEONE FROM. ENDING UP ON THE STREET YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT MIGHT TAKE THEM A COUPLE MONTHS TO FIND THEIR WAY. YOU KNOW INTO SOME ALTERNATIVE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SAYING THAT. THANK YOU OTHER OTHER WITNESSES OTHER QUESTIONS RATHER. ARE ON I JUST WANT TO ADD IT'S NOT A UNIQUE TO LA COUNTY I KNOW I HAVE STAFF HERE IN THE CAPITAL WHO HAVE. BEEN GIVEN NOTICE OF FIFTY AND A THEY'RE WORKING. THEY'VE GOT RESPONSIBILITIES ARE. IN PLACES LIKE LA WHERE TRAFFIC BECOMES A FACTOR IN HOW YOU GET TO WORK OR IN THE BAY AREA AND TO ALMOST ANYWHERE I MEAN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS I WISH. I WISH PEOPLE WEREN'T SUBJECTED TO SUCH HIGH RENT INCREASES BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT LANDLORDS HAVE. CERTAIN CERTAIN RIGHTS SAID THE TO CHARGE WHAT THEY FEEL THEY CAN. DO APPROPRIATELY AND LESSER SO THE REGULATION SO I THINK -- WHILE IT DOES ADD TO A PERIOD OF TIME -- GIVEN OUR HOUSING SHORT FOR RIGHT NOW I CAN'T. SEE ANY REASON WHY THIS WOULD BE. ONEROUS FOR ANYONE SO UP. YOU'RE BRINGING THE BILL AND I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTION BY SENATOR MORNING. THE MOTION IS SAID TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE THANK YOU THANK YOU. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER TEN A. B. ELEVEN TEN JACKSON HI JACKSON I BORDERS. OR JUST NO DO RUSSELL. RUSSELL I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I'D JONES. JONES NO MONNING. MONNING ICE STERN. STERN I BURKE. WHITE HOUSE E. Y. CASKEY I SIXTY TO SIXTY TWO WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. AND APPRECIATE. YOU'RE RESPONDING SO QUICKLY TO OUR ALL POINTS BULLETIN. AND NEXT UP WE HAVE OF WITH HIS ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE IS HERE HE'S NEXT UP ON THE FILE. FILE ITEM TWELVE AB. THIRTEEN EIGHTY GOOD AFTERNOON AND TRUE TO FORM YOU DON'T HAVE A SINGLE PIECE OF PAPER WITH YOU. ALWAYS IMPRESSED ME A YOU'VE EITHER GOT IT UP HERE NO COMPUTER WITH YOU TODAY. WELL ARE. YOU CAN TRUST YOU TELL YOU'RE NOT IMPRESSED WHEN I ALL RIGHT IT IS RISKY. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AB. THIRTEEN EIGHTY HAS TO DEAL WITH THE DISPOSITION OF PREMARITAL AGREEMENTS IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE LAW AN AXE PROTECTIONS FOR PARTIES ENTERING INTO PREMARITAL AGREEMENTS IN PARTICULAR. IT ADVISES ON ON REPRESENTED PARTY TO SEEK REPRESENTATION AND IMPOSES A MINIMUM SEVEN DAY WAITING PERIOD BETWEEN WHEN AN AGREEMENT ASDRAFTED AND WANTED TO SIGN ANOTHER WERE IN ORDER FOR THE AGREEMENT TO BE VALID. HOWEVER SOME AMBIGUITY HAS ARISEN IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THIS LAW PARTICULARLY WHETHER OR NOT THAT SEVEN DAY WAITING PERIOD APPLIES TO BOTH REPRESENTED AND UNDER REPRESENTED PARTIES STAND. IF AN AGREEMENT IS AMENDED WHETHER OR NOT THE AMENDMENT TRIGGERS ITSELF ANOTHER SEVEN DAY WAITING PERIOD FOR THE AGREEMENT TO BE VALID. SO THIS BILL CLARIFIES STATE LAW A. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY WOULD INTERPRET THE ORIGINAL STATUTE IN THE BROADEST POSSIBLE WAY -- IT APPLIES TO BOTH REPRESENTED AND UNDER REPRESENTED PARTIES AND CLARIFIES THAT IF AN AGREEMENT IS AMENDED AS LONG AS IS AMENDMENTS ARE SUBSTANTIVE BUT THAT TRIGGERS ANOTHER SEVEN DAY WAITING PERIOD SO WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IS LARRY DOYLE FROM THE CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON MAN SENATOR MEMBERS -- THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL AS WELL EXPLAINED IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH WAS EXCELLENT. AND BY ASSEMBLY MEMBEROBERNOLTE THE THIS WORKS OUT TO BE FAIRLY SIMPLE EVERYBODY AGREES. WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROVISION OF THE CODE NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TELL EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANS THAT THE DOCUMENT. IS CO HAS TO BE GIVEN TO THE PERSON THANK PERCENT AT SEVEN DAYS -- THE NOBODY OBJECTS TO THAT THE ONLY ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT. AT THE END. YOU WHETHER OR NOT. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE OF SOMEBODY'S REPRESENTED. AND THE DECISION -- THE WE'VE MADE ND IN CONJUNCTION ITH. ASSEMBLY STAFF AND SENATE STAFF REALLY IS THAT -- WE SHOULD BE MOST PROTECTIVE OF THE PARTICIPANTS PARTICULARLY THE WEAKER PARTIES WHO ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES WHO ARE ASKED TO SIGN. A PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENTS SO THE YOU CAN OF THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE SIGNING IN CAN MAKE A DECISION. WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE INTO YOU KNOW GETTING AN ATTORNEY. THE DAY BEFORE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SIGN A PRENUP DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE WELL INFORMED AS TO WHAT'S IN THAT. NO MATTER HOW GOOD THE ATTORNEY MAY BE. THIS MAY BE A LITTLE BIT -- YOU KNOW. RESTRICTIVE IN SOME SENSE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. IF YOU HAVE TWO COMPETENT ATTORNEYS WORKING TOGETHER. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THEM. BE ABLE. TO GET THINGS DONE FAIRLY QUICKLY SO YOU HAVE THE SEVEN DAYS. AND IF SOMETHING IS GETTING IN THE WAY FROM A TIMING STANDPOINT IS. WAITED OUT THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS DO A POST UP. SO -- WHO WERE TRYING TO BE AS PRODUCTIVE AS POSSIBLE AND TO CLARIFY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE? AND WE HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. EACH STEP FORWARD PLEASE. YOU CAN TAKE A SEAT RIGHT IN FRONT [inaudible] VERY GOOD. GOOD AFTERNOON THE TWO MINUTES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR JACKSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BOBBY LEVY AND I'M HERE TODAY. THE FUTURE CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST. AND THE FAMILY LAW EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. OF THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION SO I HAVE TWO HATS TODAY. OF BOTH ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSE AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY UNLESS AMENDED. BASICALLY BOTH ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSE THE PART OF THE BILL TO THE EXTENT THE SEVEN DAY WAITING PERIOD APPLIES TO REPRESENTED PARTIES. AS EXPLAINED IN THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN CASE OF IN RAIN MARRIAGE OF COD WELL FOSSIL IN FOSS SO. THE SEVEN DAY PERIOD MAKES SENSE AS A NECESSARY CONDITION THE FINDING VOLUNTARY EXECUTION ON THE PART OF AN ON REPRESENTED PARTY BECAUSE THE THE REQUIREMENT AFFORDS A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME TO OBTAIN AND CONSULT. WITH INDEPENDENT COUNSEL PRIOR TO SIGNING A PREMARITAL AGREEMENT. ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN A PARTY IS ALL RAPPERS ALREADY REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL IN THE TRANSACTION. OBTAINING THE REQUISITE ADVICE CAN OCCUR VERY QUICKLY AND NO PURPOSE IS SERVED BY IMPOSING A STATUTORY WAITING PERIOD. RETAIN COUNSEL CAN CONTROL THE TIMELINE IF NOT AVAILABLE STRAIGHT AWAY. TO REVIEW A DOCUMENT ANY COMPETENT ATTORNEY COULD ADVISE THE CLIENT NOT DECIDED UNTIL HERE SHE HAS REVIEWED THE DOCUMENT AND CONSULTED WITH THE CLIENT. WHETHER THIS OCCURRED WITHIN THE SEVENTY PERIOD OR BEYOND THAT. THE CLIENT IS PROTECTED. NUMBER NEGOTIATING A PREMARITAL AGREEMENTS TYPICAL FOR COUNSEL WITH THE CLIENT WITH GREATER MEANS OR GREATER INCOME. TO BE THE ONE TO PREPARE THE FIRST DRAFT AND REVISIONS ARE TYPICALLY REQUESTED BY THE LOWER EARNING OR LESSER MEANS SPOUSE TO BE. AND THOSE REVISIONS ARE TYPICALLY REVISIONS THAT BENEFIT THE PERSON WHO IS BEING ASKED TO SIGN THE PRIMERA ALL AGREEMENT. OFTENTIMES THESE VOLUNTARY AGREED UPON CHANGES ARE MADE CLOSE TO THE WEDDING DATE. HAVING COUNCIL IS A PROTECTIVE FACTOR AND EVEN THE BILL'S SPONSOR CONCEDES THAT REPRESENTATION BY COUNSEL PROVIDES SOLID PROTECTION. AGAINST DECEPTION UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. ALLOWING RETAIN COUNSEL TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO CONTROL THE TIME LINE IS PREFERABLE. VERSUS HAVING THE PARTIES ENTER AN AGREEMENT THAT NEITHER NEITHER OF THEM WANT. OR EVEN WORSE HAVING THE PARTIES DEAL WITH THE EMBARRASSMENT AND FINANCIAL DEVASTATION OF HAVING TO EITHER POSTPONE OR CANCEL THEIR WEDDING. AT THE LAST MINUTE BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO START THE SEVENTIES ALL OVER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IT IS FOR THOSE REASONS THAT THESE BOTH OR THE GIVE THESE ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSE THE BILL. THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MY TING IN NON. YOU KNOW I FIND THIS VERY INTERESTING I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OR MISFORTUNE I'M NOT QUITE SURE. TO DONE A NUMBER OF THESE AGREEMENTS. AND THIS IS PROBABLY FOR MOST PEOPLE THE SINGULAR MOST IMPORTANT CONTRACTING WHICH THEY EVER ENTER. OFFER MANY PEOPLE THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT MEANS TO GET MARRIED IN TERMS OF LEGAL CONSEQUENCES. CERTAINLY WHEN YOU HAVE OF PARTIES EITHER ONE OR BOTH THE CHOOSE TO ENTER INTO A PREMARITAL AGREEMENT. THERE USUALLY ASSETS OR THEIR CHILDREN THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME REASON TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS THE THE INHERENT LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ARE OF AMERICA RELATIONSHIP -- THE NOTION THAT ANYONE WOULD COMPLAIN ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN DAY WAITING PERIOD JUST AYE AYE LISTEN CAREFULLY TO YOUR TESTIMONY AND HAVING BEEN A LAWYER. DOING FAMILY LAW AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND RESPECTING YOUR ORGANIZATION SAKE I'M JUST PUZZLED UP BECAUSE OF YOUR TO YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE PROBABLY PEOPLE AT THEIR MOST EMOTIONAL. THE GETTING MARRIED THEY'RE IN LOVE THEY THEY WANT TO A PERMANENT LIFETIME COMMITMENT TO EACH OTHER. THE NOTION OF WAITING SEVEN DAYS AFTER A FINAL CONTRACT IS ENTERED INTO -- NOT ONLY DOESN'T OFFEND ME BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. PEOPLE BE ABLE TO STEP BACK AND WITH THE HELP OF COUNCIL WHICH I ALWAYS FELT WAS APPROPRIATE TO GET THE THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF WHAT YOU'RE REALLY DOING HERE -- AND USUALLY THE THE THE LESSER -- POWERFUL OF THE PARTIES -- FEEL SOME PRESSURE. TO SIGN THE AGREEMENT TO GET MARRIAGE GOING -- BUT TO HAVE THAT SEVEN DAYS IT IS I WON'T CALL A COOLING OFF PERIOD BUT IT'S A REFLECTIVE PERIOD AND I I THINK THIS MAKES EMINENTLY GOOD SENSE. JUST IN TERMS OF MY OWN EXPERIENCES ARE. NOW RECOVERING PRACTITIONER -- I I JUST A MOMENT IT A BIT OF A LOSS IN AS FAR AS THE THE CADWELL CASE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. THE COURT FOUND THE CURRENT LAW SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS -- BUT IRRESPECTIVE OF THAT THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE A POLICY LIKE THE DOES RESIDE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND NOT WITH THE COURTS SO -- WELL I APPRECIATED I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE TO EXPRESS YOUR CONCERNS. I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT A SEVEN DAY WAITING PERIOD IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER YOU REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL NOT. A KID IT CAN ONLY BE HELPFUL TO THE PARTIES WHO ULTIMATELY DO AGREE ON PREMARITAL. OF TERMS THAT ARE GONNA FALL THEM FOR HOPEFULLY THE REST OF THEIR LIVES [inaudible] SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I I DIDN'T PRACTICE FAMILY LAW BUT I DID LUCKY YOU EIGHT YOU KNOW HIGH PROFILE PRENUP -- CASE OF A RESIDENT OF MY DISTRICT IN A IN A FIANCE OF LESSER MEANS LET'S SAY SO I'M FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE LEVERAGE POINTS IN. AMIDST THE EMOTIONAL COMMITMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE -- HOW WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING A PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT? CAN BE A TOUGH ISSUE TO EVEN BROACH IN THE PENDING MARRIAGE CIRCUMSTANCE I JUST LIKE TO GIVE THE AUTHOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION I THINK THE CHAIRED. DID A GOOD JOB OF IT THAN I AM JUST YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE WAITING PERIOD WHERE BOTH. PARTIES ARE REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL I THANK YOU SENATOR OUT. NORMALLY I AM NOT WANT TO BE A PROPONENT OF FURTHER REGULATION ON THE CITIZENRY OF CALIFORNIA SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I TAKE. A VERY SERIOUSLY AND VERY CAUTIOUSLY AND I DID THINK ABOUT TO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION BUT I AS THE CHAIR SAID THIS. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE PROBABLY THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL THING THAT MOST OF THESE PARTIES WILL EVER SIGNED IN THEIR LIFETIME SO GIVEN THAT FACT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SEVEN DAYS IS ON REASONABLE. ALSO IS THE CHAIR POINTED OUT. EVEN THOUGH THE I THINK ORIGINALLY WHEN THE LAW WAS DRAFTED THE THOUGHT WAS THAT IF YOU HAVE ONE PARTY THAT'S REPRESENTED ONE THAT'S ON REPRESENTED THERE'S A BIG POWER IMBALANCE. THERE WHICH IS TRUE BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT IF YOU HAVE. ONE THAT IS TRYING TO PROTECT ASSETS IN ONE PARTY THE JUST WANTS TO GET MARRIED EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY IS REPRESENTED THERE'S STILL A POWER IMBALANCE THERE BECAUSE ONE MIGHT HAVE THE FAMILY LAW FIRM THAT'S BEEN IN THEIR FAMILY FOR GENERATIONS. AND THE OTHER HAVE SOMEONE THAT THEY THEY LOOKED UP IN THE YELLOW PAGES THAT MORNING RIGHT SO -- THEY'RE STILL A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF PRESSURE THERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PRESSURE ISN'T A EXERTING UNDUE INFLUENCE AND ALSO LET ME MAKE ONE POINT. TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT THE OPPOSITION SAID THAT I DISAGREE WITH WHICH IS THAT. WOULD BE TERRIBLE IF THIS CAUSED. A DELAY IN A WEDDING. A WRITER SO YOU KNOW WE'RE NEGOTIATING WE HAVE TO DO AN AMENDMENT AND ON A WE'VE GOT TO PUSH BACK THE WEDDING DATE BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT LEGALLY. THE THE MARRIAGE ISN'T ISN'T -- OUR CONSUMMATED UNTIL THE OUR MARRIAGE LICENSES SIDE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CEREMONY SO THE IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WHERE AN AMENDMENT HAD TO BE DRAFTED AND SIGNED AT THE LAST MINUTE. YOU COULD STILL HAVE THE CEREMONY WILL JUST HAVE TO WAIT THOSE SEVEN DAYS TO GET THE MARRIAGE LICENSE SIDE AND AS YOU POINT OUT YOUR ANALYSIS THAT MIGHT BE ON A ROMANTIC BUT A PRIMER AGREEMENTS ARE ROMANTIC AND YOU KNOW THIS IS THE WORLD WE LIVE IN SO. THERE IS A A METHODOLOGY FOR DEALING WITH EVEN THAT SITUATION I APPRECIATE HERE MENTIONING THAT BECAUSE THAT DID OCCUR SO. YOU CAN GO FORWARD WITH THE PLANNED. END THE MARRIAGE LICENSE CAN BE EXECUTED AFTER THE DATE THAT THE PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT. IS EXECUTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AT GLAD TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE THAT IS YOUR CLOTHES YES MA'AM VERY GOOD ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION. TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

RIGHT WE HAVE A A NEXT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA. THIS IS FILE ITEM FIFTEEN COLLEAGUES THIS IS -- A. B.. FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN GOOD AFTERNOON AND AGAIN AT THE WITNESSES TO WITNESSES ON EACH SIDE TWO MINUTES EACH SO -- A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AT FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TODAY. UNDER EXISTING LAW ONLY PROSECUTORS MAY FILE LAWSUITS CHARGING UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES THESE ACTIONS MAY BE BROUGHT FORWARD BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR CITY ATTORNEY SERVING A POT A CITY WITH A POPULATION GREATER THAN SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. WHERE DITRICT ATTORNEY BRINGS FORWARD AN ACTION UNDER THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW THE COUNTY RECEIVES ALL THE CIVIL PENALTIES AWARDED BY THE COURT? HOWEVER WHEN THE CITY ATTORNEY BRING SUCH AN ACTION THOSE CIVIL PENALTIES MUST BE TO SPLIT EVENLY WITH THE TREASURE OF THE COUNTY IN WHICH THE JUDGMENT WAS ENTERED. EVEN IF THE COUNTY PROVIDE NO ASSISTANCE IN PURSUING THE ACTION OF THE BY THE CITY ATTORNEY. THIS DISCREPANCY HAS LEFT THOSE ELIGIBLE CITY ATTORNEY'S WITH WHAT I SEE IS A DIFFICULT CHOICE BALANCING THE PURSUIT OF LEGAL RECOURSE AGAINST UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS. VERSUS THE REALITY OF FINITE PUBLIC RESOURCES. LET ME BE CLEAR THE LEGAL AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE ELIGIBLE CITY ATTORNEY'S HAS BEEN AND WILL ALWAYS BE UNDER THIS BILL TO PROVIDE LEGAL RELIEF FOR HARM TO CONSUMERS. AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN REQUIRES THAT PENALTIES COLLECTED BY THE ELIGIBLE CITY ATTORNEY FROM AN ACTION UNDER THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW BE PAID ENTIRELY TO THE CITY. THE BILL WAS AMENDED TO ALLOW THE COUNTY TO STILL RECEIVE HALF OF AN AWARD PENALTY IF THEY PARTICIPATE IN PRE LITIGATION INVESTIGATION. OF THE ACTION BY ENSURING EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE PENALTIES AWARDED UNDER UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW THIS BILL WILL EMPOWER THOSE ELIGIBLE CITY ATTORNEYS TO PROSECUTE UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES IN THE INTEREST OF CONSUMERS. AND OF CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT WITH ME THIS AFTERNOON I HAVE REPRESENTATIVES HERE ON BEHALF OF SEGA C. ATTORNEY MAR ELLIOTT AND LOS ANGELES CITY ATTORNEY MIKE FEUER. MARCH TWO MINUTES PLEASE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MARK AND CORN THE CHIEF DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. AB ONE FOUR SEVEN SEVEN BRINGS THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW BACK INTO BALANCE. IT ALLOWS CITY ATTORNEYS FROM THE THREE LARGEST CALIFORNIA CITIES TO KEEP ALL THE CIVIL PENALTIES WHEN THEY ACT INDEPENDENTLY TO ENFORCE THE U. C. L.. AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY SOME DOES NOT INCREASE OR DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF PENALTY IN ANY WAY. THE TRIAL COURT JUDGES STILL IN POWERTO IMPOSE ONLY THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF PENALTY. BASED ON THE CONDUCT OF THE DEFENDANT A PARTICULAR MATTER LET ME STRESS THE POTENTIAL MONETARY RELIEF HE IS NOT AND SHOULD NEVER BE THE REASON TO BRING A CIVIL ENFORCEMENT ACTION. OFFICE IS LIKE MINE ACROSS THE STATE WORKS HARD TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT USING TOOLS LIKE THE UCL. MONETARY PENALTIES OR ALWAYS SECONDARY TO MAKING VICTIMS HOLE IN OBTAINING INJUNCTIVE REMEDIES THAT PREVENT FUTURE MISCONDUCT. BUT IN CASES WHERE CIVIL PENALTIES ARE APPROPRIATE AND THE DEFENDANT HAS THE ABILITY TO PAY IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT THE AGENCY THAT DID THE WORK SHOULD KEEP THOSE FUNDS. TO SUPPORT FUTURE INVESTIGATION AND FUTURE LITIGATION. AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN ENCOURAGES LOCAL AGENCIES TO WORK TOGETHER BY PUTTING THEM ALL ON AN EQUAL FOOTING INCLUDING WHERE INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES ARE SHARED BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS WE URGE AN AYE VOTE ON FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MICHAEL BOSTROM AN ASSISTANT CITY ATTORNEY WITH A LOS ANGELES CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. I'M THE HEAD OF THE OFFICE IS AFFIRMATIVE LITIGATION DIVISION AND AS SUCH A RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION CIVIL LITIGATION BROUGHT BY OUR OFFICE. CITY ATTORNEY MIKE YOUR ASSET ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY AND YOU CAN BASIS THANKS TO YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR COMMENTS. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THE PRIMARY REMEDY AND UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW CASES IS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THUS OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IN PURSUING ANY UCL ACTION IS FIRST AND FOREMOST TO STOP THE OFFENDING CONDUCT. CITY ATTORNEYS WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH COUNTIES AND ANY OTHER AGENCY THEY CAN ASSIST US WITH THE SUBJECTIVE. WE OWE IT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS TO DO SO. UNDERSTOOD THE ATTORNEY MIKE FEAR OUR OFFICE IS BEEN A LEADER IN BRINGING CONSUMER PROTECTION MATTERS USING THE U. C. L. WE BROUGHT THE UCL ACTION CHALLENGING WELLS FARGO'S PRACTICE. OF OPENING FAKE ACCOUNTS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS WITHOUT ITS CUSTOMERS KNOWLEDGE MORE RECENTLY WE BROUGHT YOU SEE L. ACTIONS AGAINST VAPING COMPANIES. WE ALLEGE HAVE MARKETED TOBACCO PRODUCTS TO MINORS A U. C. L. ACTION AGAINST THE WEATHER CHANNEL APP WHOM WE ALLEGE HAS MISLED CONSUMERS INTO GRANTING ACCESS TO THEIR LOCATION DATA. AND YOU STILL ACTIONS AGAINST TURBO. AND H. AND R. BLOCK WHEN WE ALLEGE HAVE MISLED CONSUMERS INTO PAYING HEFTY. FEES FOR TAX PREPARATION PRODUCTS THEY WERE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE FOR FREE. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THESE EXAMPLES THE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF PROVIDED TO CONSUMERS BY SUCCESSFUL CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWSUITS BY CITY ATTORNEYS IMPACTS CONSUMERS FAR BEYOND THE GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES OF THE CITY. THE CURRENT STATUTE RELATED TO PENALTIES HOWEVER IS OUTDATED AND IS IN NO WAY TIED TO SUCCESSFUL CONSUMER PROTECTION EFFORTS. AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WOULD STRENGTHEN CONSUMER PROTECTION EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA BY ENSURING THAT ROBUST CONSUMER PROTECTION PRACTICESARE FULLY RESOURCE. WE HAVE A VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COUNTY THE COUNTY HAS BEEN A KEY PARTNER ON MATTERS RANGING FROM ACTIONS AGAINST BUSINESSES WHO STEAL WAGES OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. TO ACTIONS AGAINST NOTORIOUS WHO DEFRAUD VULNERABLE CONSUMERS. IF THE COUNTY HAS PARTICIPATED IN THE MATTER IN THAT PRE LITIGATION INVESTIGATION IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTY SHOULD RECEIVE THROUGH OUR LITIGATION EFFORTS. WE ALSO BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE SHOULD RETAIN ALL PENALTIES IN MATTERS THAT WE PURSUE WITHOUT ANY COUNTY PARTICIPATION. THIS IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF FAIRNESS BUT ALSO EFFICIENCY. AS A MATTER OF STATE LAW STATUTORY PENALTIES ARE ONLY TO BE USE FOR FURTHER CONSUMER PROTECTION PURPOSES. pAGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST EFFECTIVE IN VINDICATING CONSUMER RIGHTS RESULT IN STRONGER CONSUMER PROTECTION FOR THE PUBLIC THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I GIVE YOU A LITTLE EXTRA TIME BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS A BIT OF A KERFUFFLE HERE AND I'M SURE MEMBERS. ON THE DíAS A VERY INTERESTED IN YOUR PERSPECTIVE SO WITH THAT ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHY DO I HAVE A FEELING THAT THERE ARE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MIGHT BE COMING FROM LA COUNTY? AND IF YOU ARE CAMANCHE OPPOSITION. TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JUDY WHITEHURST I'M A SENIOR ASSISTANT COUNTY COUNCIL IN THE OFFICE OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY COUNCIL. EXPRESSING OPPOSITION TO A. B.. FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO ALL CONSUMERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND IT'S EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES. CONSUMER FRAUD PARTICULARLY IN A LARGE COUNTY LIKE LOS ANGELES IS PERVASIVE. IT HURTS PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE PARTICULARLY THE VULNERABLE LIKE ELDERLY IMMIGRANTS YOUNG PEOPLE AND POOR. AND SIGNIFICANTLY CONSUMER FRAUD. DOES NOT END AT THE CITY BORDERS IT FLOWS OVER AND AFFECTS ALL RESIDENTS OF THE COUNTY. THE STRONGEST WAY TO FIGHT CONSUMER FRAUD AND PROTECT CONSUMERS. IS ONE GOVERNMENT WORKS TOGETHER AS A TEAM. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE HAVE A HIGH HIGHLY EFFECTIVE TEAM OF DEPARTMENTS THAT PROTECT CONSUMERS AND PROSECUTE BAD ACTORS. THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COUNTY INCLUDING IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN MY OFFICE WE HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED AN AFFIRMATIVE LITIGATION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION DIVISION. WE HAVE THIRTEEN LAWYERS WHO FIGHT FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION EVERY DAY. FOR MANY YEARS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. HAS ALSO S. AND HAS AN ESTABLISHED CONSUMER PROTECTION SECTION. WE BRING ACTIONS TOGETHER. AND WE ALSO JOIN WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND CITY ATTORNEY'S. WE ALSO USE OUR INVESTIGATIVE DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE AGRICULTURAL WEIGHTS AND MEASURES TO ADDRESS. COUNTY WIDE UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES FALSE ADVERTISING AND PUBLIC NUISANCE SOME EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE RECENTLY -- SETTLE LAWSUIT THAT WE BROUGHT WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AGAINST WILY SANDERS TRUCKING COMPANY THAT WAS ILLEGALLY TRANSPORTING HAZARDOUS LEAD BATTERY WASTE FROM EXIDE. THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY INCLUDING IN SOME OF YOUR DISTRICTS. AND ON THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES ON ITS WAY TO BAKERSFIELD. OR THE ANA PLEX CHROME PLATING FACILITY IN PARAMOUNT WHERE WE'VE PARTNERED WITH THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT TO REDUCE TOXIC EMISSIONS. SINCE WE FILED A LAWSUIT EMISSIONS ARE TEN TIMES LOWER AND OF COURSE EMISSIONS DON'T AND AND PARAMOUNT. THEY FLOW OVER TO THE COMMUNITIES AND THE AREAS AROUND THERE. WE RECENTLY FILED THE LAWSUIT WHERE PEOPLE IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT WE'RE BEING SCAMMED OUT OF THEIR JUDGMENTS. THE VICTIMS ARE FROM ALL OVER LOS ANGELES COUNTY. INCLUDING THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. AND ALL THE WAY FROM LONG BEACH TO SANTA CLARITA. AND WE'VE SUIT ADDISON OVER AT THE WALL THE FIRE AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS OVERLY SO CANYON THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TEST BUT I'M SURE THE BE MORE QUESTIONS. TWO MINUTES IF YOU ENTER AN AFTERNOON AUDIBLE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JONI KITA ON BEHALF OF LA COUNTY IN OPPOSITION. I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS WE SERVE CONSUMERS IN LA COUNTY IS EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES. IN OUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY UNINCORPORATED AREAS IN OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTIES AND ALL OVER THE WORLD AND COUNTRY IN FACT. THIS TWENTY TWELVE MY DEPARTMENT IS HELPED OVER SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND OF THESE CONSUMERS RECOVER APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ARCHES INTERJECTION YOU'RE NOT FROM THE SAME YOUR FROM THE COUNTY COUNCIL IN YOUR FROM IN A SEPARATE AGENCY. I YES THAT'S CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU I'M A RECOVERING COUNTY COUNCIL MYSELF. CONDOLENCES. LIKE LIKE MISS WHITE HEARST I BELIEVE AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WILL REDUCE THE CONCERN CONSUMER SERVICES THE COUNTY. PROVIDES INCLUDING THOSE PROVIDED BY IT MIGHT DEPARTMENT AT THE CONSUME AT THAT APARTMENT CONSUMER BUSINESS AFFAIRS. WE WORK WITH THE COUNTY COUNCIL AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO LEVERAGE IVIL PENALTIES TO INVESTIGATE ISSUES OF COUNTY WIDE CONCERN AND I ALSO HAVE SOME RECENT EXAMPLES VERY BRIEFLY. EARLIER THIS YEAR WE SUPPORTED AN INVESTIGATION BY THE LA CITY ATTORNEY AND STATE BAR THAT RESULTED IN MISDEMEANOR CHARGES AGAINST IMMIGRATION CONSULTANTS. WITH OFFICES IN LA CITY BUT VICTIMS ALL OF AN ACCOUNT AND I BELIEVE THE CITY REFERENCE THAT. IN HIS TESTIMONY LAST MONTH WE SUPPORTED AN INVESTIGATION BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY RESULTING IN THE FILING OF OVER FIFTY FELONIES IS THE CRIMINAL CASE. AGAINST THE MAN PEDDLING SICK AND DYING PUPPIES TO CONSUMERS AGAIN FROM ALL OVER OUTSIDE THE COUNTY AS WELL -- BUT CIVIL PENALTIES DON'T JUST SUPPORT INVESTIGATIONS THAT RESULT IN PROSECUTION -- A BIG PORTION OF OUR WORK IS IN THE AREA OF LANDLORD TENANT FOR EXAMPLE LAST MONTH WE HELP A HUNDRED AND TWO YEAR OLD WOMAN. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF THIS AVOID DEPENDING ELECTION BECAUSE OUR LANDLORD HAD NOT PROPERLY SERVE NOTICE. OUR CALL CENTER WITH THE CALL CENTER ENCOUNTERS WE HELP TENANTS AND ALL CONSUMERS WITH ISSUES THAT ARE DEEPLY MEANINGFUL AND DEEP CONCERN TO THEM. N. F. BOTTOM BOTTOM CIVIL PENALTIES PROVIDE MY DEPARTMENT WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO HELP CONSUMERS WITH LOST THIRTY DOLLARS FIFTY DOLLARS HUNDRED DOLLARS. THESE ARE CASES WHICH WILL LIKELY NEVER RISE TO THE LEVEL OF PROSECUTION WERE OFTEN THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE. OF FORTY FOR THE COUNTIES WORKING POOR ON SMALL DOLLAR CONSUMER ISSUES AND CERTAINLY. OF THE LA THIRTY DALY CITY ATTORNEY HAS BROUGHT SOME IN FACT PACKED FULL CONSUMER CASES I VALUE MY PARTNERSHIP WITH MIKE FEAR. BUT BECAUSE IN CLOSING BECAUSE CONSUMER CIVIL PENALTIES ARE ARE CRITICAL TO MY DEPARTMENTS OPERATIONS AND BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONLY LOCAL CONSUMER AFFAIRS AGENCY IN THE STATE OFFERING THE SERVICES SERVICES. I MUST RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN OF A THANK YOU THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU'D STEP FORWARD -- NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. HAPPENING CHAIR MEMBERS TO NISHA VOTER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL RIGHT AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MAR WE'RE GOING TO BRING THIS TO THE COMMITTEE I JUST WANT TO START AND I KNOW CENTER AKOWSKI HAS QUESTION WE'LL GO FROM. THERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT OUT OF A AS AN AMENDMENT THAT ARE I INSIST UPON BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU'RE NOT SURE IF IT'S BROKEN -- IS IF THE COUNTY IS IN ANY WAY INVOLVED IN THE EARLY INVESTIGATION IF THERE'S ANY INVOLVEMENT OF THE COUNTY. THEN THE WHATEVER SETTLEMENT IS REACH WOULD BE SHARED EQUALLY AT WHICH IS WHAT IS WHAT HAPPENS NOW. THAT REALLY THE ONLY DISTINCTION HERE AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IS THAT IF THIS IS OUR LITIGATION. THAT IS COMMANDS AND EXECUTED EXCLUSIVELY. BY THE CITY ATTORNEY THEN THE BAND THE THE FINANCIAL BENEFIT WILL END IN NEAR TO THE TO THE CITY ATTORNEY EXCLUSIVELY. BOB RIGHT NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS IF THE COUNTY. HAS NO INVOLVEMENT THEY STILL GET 50% OF WHATEVER THE JUDGMENT OR SETTLEMENT IS. THIS WILL SIMPLY. A PROVIDE THAT -- THAT. IF THERE IS NO WORK SHARING THEN THERE. DOESN'T GO THERE WON'T BE IN DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ANY KIND OF SETTLEMENT SHARING SO YOU YOU'RE EAGER TO RESPONSE TO TELL ME OF MY WRONG ON THIS. YOU'RE NOT WRONG I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A MISUNDERSTANDING BECAUSE WE LOOK ATIT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR WHOEVER PUTS THE WORK IN AS SHOULD SHOULD RECOVER THE BENEFIT BUT THE THE PROBLEM IS THE CONSUMERS. WHO ARE THE CONSUMERS BETTER IMPACTED? IN THE WELLS FARGO CASE IT WASN'T A MATTER OF WELLS FARGO OPENING FAKE ACCOUNTS ONLY IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. THE ENTIRE COUNTY -- CONSUMERS WERE ALL IMPACTED BY THOUGHT. WE WERE WE RECEIVE 50% OF THAT RECOVERY FROM THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WHICH WE ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR AND WE STARTED OUR AFFIRMATIVE LIVE LITIGATION DIVISION SO THAT WE CAN HELP MORE. COUNTY WIDE CONSUMERSTHE CASES THAT ARE BROUGHT ARE GENERALLY NOT JUST WITHIN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. EVERYBODY'S IMPACTED AND SO THAT'S WHY THE WAY THE LAW IS RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE BECAUSE HALF OF THE MONEY WILL GO TO THE CITY WHO HAS ABOUT 40% IN LOS ANGELES OF THE CONSTITUENTS. AND THE REMAINDER WILL COME TO THE COUNTY SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE SRVICES TO THE OTHER CITIES THATDON'T HAVE -- THE STRONGER CITY ATTORNEYS AND AND JOE MAY BE ABLE TO TALK MORE ABOUT -- HOW HIS RELATIONSHIP AND WORKING WITH THE? WELL LET ME LET ME ASK THE AUTHOR TO RESPOND TO THAT THE ARGUMENT THEN SHARED IT SHOWING WHY YOU'RE THE CHAIR YOU GOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU DESCRIBED THE BILL PERFECTLY. AND I WOULD GUESS THAT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF DISCUSSING FAIRNESS WELL THEN EVERY INSTANCE IT WAS GIVEN A BY THE OPPOSITE OPPONENTS THIS BILL TODAY IN NONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS THAT THE SENATE RETURNEES ARE INVOLVED. RECEIVE ANY OF THOSE AWARDS SO YES THEY'RE PROSECUTING CASES THAT IMPACT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES DOESN'T SHARING THE WARDS THEY GET. SO THIS IS ALL UPSIDE FOR THE CURRENT COUNTIES ALL DOWNSIDE FOR THE CITY ATTORNEY'S AND THAT SIMPLY ISN'T FAIR WHAT WE'RE DOING IS EXACTLY TO YOUR BRILLIANT RECOMMENDATION IF THEY'RE INVOLVED IN ANYWAY. THEY WILL GET SOME OF THE TIMES I'M I'M DETECTING A NOTE OF WHAT WOULD I CALL IT. WELL I DON'T KNOW. OBSEQUIOUS THANK YOU THANK YOU THERE ARE OTHER PHRASES BUT I WAS TOO MANY USE THEM IN PUBLIC OBSEQUIOUS DOES BUT I APPRECIATED I AND I DO APPRECIATE BECAUSE EVEN. BRILLIANCE OF COURSE OF COURSE THANK YOU CENTER UNANIMOUS MADAM CHAIR BECAUSE AS YOU THIS AMENDMENT THAT WE HAVE IN THIS THAT IF THEY DO SOME WORK IN THE PRE SHOPPERS. THEY COULD DO A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF WORK THERE STILL ANY AT 50% OF THE AWARD RIGHT PART OF ME WOULD STATE NOT YOU KNOW WILL COULD BE COMMISERATE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT YOU PUT AN END FOR NOT SAYING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HERE CAN GO. HOME FEELING GOOD ABOUT WHAT WAS DONE HERE THE CURRENT SITUATION IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR PERSISTING IN OUR DOING SOMEHOW THE CITY ATTORNEY'S SHOULD HAVE TO SHARE. ALL THE PROCEEDS WITH IT DOING ALL OF HALF THE PROCEEDS WERE DOING ALL THE WORK. IS SIMPLY INDEFENSIBLE. SO IF A AND THEN I'M GOING TO OPEN IT UP IT. SO WHAT I HEAR THE COUNTY COUNCIL SAYING IS THAT. THAT BECAUSE THE IMPACTS ARE BROADER THAN JUST THE CITY IN SOME OF THESE INSTANCES. THAT THE COUNTY COUNCIL SHOULD GET A BENEFIT. FROM THAT NOT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT GOES TO THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTY. IT'S THAT THE MONEY THAT'S GOING TO COME IN AND WHAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE REFERRED WAS ATTORNEY'S FEES -- WILL COME TO THE COUNTY -- HOW? IS THAT. SO WHAT WE DO WE THEN USE THE MONEY TO ENFORCE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS THROUGHOUT FOR pCOUNTY AND WE ALL WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE COUNTY COUNSEL'S OFFICE NOT JUST OUR OFFICE. WELL WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY THAT COMES IN FROM. OF THE WORK YOU MENTIONED A COUPLE THE CASES CONGRATULATIONS -- THAT YOU'VE TRUST COMPLY OR THAT YOU HAVE COMPLETED WHERE YOU GOT A 100% OF THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WHY. AT THE END THE CITY DIDN'T GET ANY AYE I DON'T THINK THE CITY'S COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT IT'S BASICALLY. IF IF WE DO ALL THE WORK. ALL THE WORK I MEAN EVERY BIT OF THE WORK THEN IT SHOULD BENEFIT. THE AGENCY THAT DID THE WORK. WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS THAT IF THE CITY DOES ALL THE WORK 50% OF IT BY VIRTUE OF THE CURRENT LAW HAS TO GO TO THE COUNTY THAT'S THE ISSUE. YES IT IS THE ISSUE BUT BUT AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO MY FIRST POINT WHICH WAS WHO BENEFITS FROM IT. NOT NECESSARILY OUR OFFICE THE CONSTITUENTS AND THE CONSTITUENTS ARE COUNTY WIDE SO IF THE CITY IF THE CITY RECEIVES ALL OF THE RECOVERY. WHO REPRESENTS THE REST LIKE IN WELLS FARGO WHO REPRESENTS THE REST OF THE 60% OF THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES THAT'S OUR OFFICE? OR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND WHEN OUR FUNDS ARE A DIMINISHED IT MEANS LESS FOR INVESTIGATIONS AND LESS WORK FOR THE REMAINING ANGELES. BUT THE CITY RESIDENTS WILL BENEFIT FROM IT. AND YOU DON'T THINK THAT THE BY VIRTUE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE CITY ATTORNEY WITH WELLS FARGO THAT. ACTUALLY ALL THE RESIDENTS TO CALIFORNIA BENEFITTED. RELIGION I DO THINK THEY BENEFIT AND THAT AND AND ONE OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT IT IS THAT WE RECEIVED HALF OF THAT PENALTY. OKAY THANK YOU. FOR A CENTER WERE CASKEY FOLLOWED BY -- CENTER MINING IN AND SENATOR -- GONZALEZ MANAGER YOUYOU WERE HITTING ON THE POINT THAT I WAS LOOKING AT IS FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS I THINK THE THE THE WORK THAT YOUR OFFICE SAYS IN THE WORK TO THE CITY ATTORNEY DOES THE WORK IN ANY. CITY TURN YOUR DH TO BENEFITS EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THAT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF WE STOP THE BAD ACTIVITY AND WE'RE LOSING. WE LOSING TRACK OF WHO GETS THE SPOILS SURE. SANTA BARBARA COUNTY VENTURA COUNTY ALAMEDA COUNTY EVERYBODY WANTS THE MONEY THEY GET IT COMES IN BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM FUNDAMENTALLY FAIR WHEN THEY'RE DOING A 100% THE WORK. AND YOU GUYS WANT TO SPEND MONEY OF COURSE EVERY EVERY COUNTY WANTS TO SPEND MONEY AND IT'S NOT VICE VERSA I WAS GOING TO ASK IF IF THEY DID HUNDREDS AND THE WORK THEY GIVE SOME MONEY TO THE THE CITY AND OBVIOUSLY THAT ANSWER. IS NO SO YOU ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS. GO AROUND THE HORN WILL GO TO SENATOR DRAWS SO NEXT. I KNOW THE COUNTY HAS IT RAISE THIS ISSUE BUT I WOULD BE CONCERNED. IS. HAVING THIS HIT OF I DON'T KNOW. HOW MUCH MONEY EXACTLY BUT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF SEVENTY MIL I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE? ANSWER IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME. THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT AS A COUNTY. THEY HAVE YOU HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT -- HOW DO YOU? OF ILL USE THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY ESPECIALLY IF YOUR DEPARTMENT IS TRYING. TO YOU KNOW JUST GOT UP AND GOING AND AND MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I CERTAINLY WANT YOU TO CONTINUE TO DO YOUR WORK. YOU BOTH ARE DOING GOOD THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES ARE DOING GOOD WORK -- YOU KNOW -- FIGHTING BACK AGAINST THESE -- SO I WANT TO APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK. OF SO I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE. I GUESS THAT'S MY CONCERN ON BEHALF I MEAN I SUPPORT. THE CITY'S POSITION -- BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE COUNTY. TAKING THIS HIT IF THERE'S A WAY MADAM CHAIR THAT -- THESE CONVERSATIONS COULD CONTINUE MAYBE THERE'S SOME RELIEF THERE IF THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE COUNTIES ARE INTERESTED THEN -- I WOULD THINK SUPPORTING THE CITIES. THINK THE THING THAT THE THE STRIKES ME IS. THERE IS AN AND I'M CONCERNED THAT THE THAT. THE THE AGENCIES CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER. OF BECAUSE IF THEY DO THEN BOTH WILL BENEFIT SO I'VE TALKED TO THE AUTHOR THE BILL AND COMPLEX PRESS MY CONCERNED. DAD IF IF I GET TO KEEP IT ALL THEN I'M NOT GONNA SURE BECAUSE I HAVE THE CHANCE TO KEEP IT ALL. AND I WAS ASSURED THAT THAT IS NOT. AT LEAST IT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE. AND I WOULD HOPE IT WOULD CONTINUE NOT BEING THE CASE BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WERE YOU WE CAN SOMETIMES BE TALKING ABOUT SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY. THAT ONE PARTY COULD WANT TO KEEP IT RATHER THAN TO SHARE IT SO I WONDER COULD THE CITY ATTORNEY OF LA JUST GIVE US. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT ISSUE YES I AND I AND ALL ALL REFERENCE BACK TO MY OPENING REMARKS THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THE PRIMARY REMEDY. ALL OF THESE CASES INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND SAW US AS PROSECUTORS WE ARE NOT LOOKING TO GO AFTER THESE CASES FOR MONEY WE ARE LOOKING TO GO AFTER THE CASE IS TO STOP THE OFFENDING CONDUCT. AND WE TRUE WE GO INTO THIS BUSINESS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO PROTECT CONSUMERS WE ARE THERE FOR CONSUMERS THE COUNTY IS THERE FOR CONSUMERS IF THERE IS A MATTER THAT WE CAN PURSUE JOINTLY WITH THE COUNTER. TO THE COUNTY TO VINDICATE CONSUMERS YOU BETTER BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER TO DO IT. THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SO QUESTION FOR THE COUNTY. IF THIS CITY PARTICIPATE IN AN INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION THAT'S INITIATED BY THE COUNTY. ARE YOU PREPARED TO SHARE HALF OF ATTORNEYS FEES WERE COVERED WITH THE CITY. THAT I DON'T BELIEVE SO BECAUSE THE CITY ONLY REPRESENTS THE CITY RESIDENTS AND WE REPRESENT ALL OF THE RESIDENTS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTY BUT IF THEY WORK WITH YOU ON THE CASE. REPRESENTING THE CITY'S INTEREST. UNDER THE CURRENT. FORMULA WOULDN'T FAIRNESS DICTATE. THAT THEY WOULD ALSO SHARE. IN A PROPORTION OF WHAT THE COUNTY IN THE IN THE ONE UNDER THE CURRENT LAW WE SHARE WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER. YOU SHARE WITH THE CITY. IT'S SPLIT BETWEEN THE CLIP. AND LET ME ASSIST IN ANY PROPOSED LEGISLATION. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT PREVENTS THAT THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. FROM INITIATING A CONSUMER PROTECTION LITIGATION. IN RECOVERING. ATTORNEYS FEES IN THAT NOW [inaudible] THANK YOU. SO IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WHEN THE COUNTY INITIATE SOMETHING AND WORKS WITH THE CITY. THAT YOU SHARE THE FUNDS WHEN WHEN THE TWO OF US BRING THE CASES TOGETHER WE SPLIT THE FUNDS. NXP LIKE SOUTHERN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS CASE AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE CITY HAS ALSO BROUGHT THE CASE AND THEY ARE REQUIRED TO SHARE WITH YOU. BUT YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO SHARE WITH THEM IS NOT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LAW. WHEN WE BRING THE CASE BY OURSELVES WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO SHARE IT WITH THEM? BUT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO SHARE WITH YOU OKAY THAT'S YEAH. OKAY -- SEE CENTER GONZALEZ. YES NOW I THINK THE AUTHORS WELL FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I WOULD ALSO AGREED -- I THINK WE DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT A CONSUMER THIS BILL AND I DON'T KNOW THAT. BUT I REVIEW THE BILL -- IT DIDN'T SEEM THE ANYTHING PRECLUDED THE COUNTY FROM CONTINUING THIS GREAT WORK WHICH MOST OF IT THAT I HAVE HERE IS EXIDE PARAMOUNT WHICH SHOULD BE AND IN MY DISTRICT -- WHICH ARE VERY -- IMPORTANT -- PROJECTS BUT AGAIN I HOPE THAT THIS WORK AND WHATEVER HAPPENS TODAY THAT IT WOULDN'T PRECLUDE THE COUNTY FROM CONTINUING THE WORK AND AND WORKING WITH THAT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES -- IN SOME REGARD BUT YOUR POINT ABOUT SMALLER CITIES VERSUS LARGER CITIES HAVING A DISTRICT THAT HAS ABOUT TWELVE CITIES -- THE SMALLER CITIES ARE NOT GOING TO SEE THIS THESE FUNDS DIRECTLY PARAMOUNT AND VERNON WILL NOT SEE THOSE DOLLARS DIRECTLY -- BENEFITING THEIR CONSTITUENCIES SO THAT'S WHERE I HAVE AN ISSUE. WITH THIS AS WELL I THINK WE'LL LET'S CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT -- I HAVE SO MANY REGIONAL BOARDS AS GAG I MEAN SO MANY THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AND I KNOW THE COUNTY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH TO BRING THESE ISSUES. TO RUSSIAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS. I HAVE A HEADACHE ON THIS ISSUE -- IN MY PREVIOUS CAPACITY AS A CITY COUNCILMAN IN MY PREVIOUS CAPACITY THE COUNTY SUPERVISOR LIKE LITERALLY I'M HEARING BOTH SIDES YELLING BACK AND FORTH INSIDE MY HEAD. ON THIS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT IS THE BEST PATH FORWARD -- WHEN YOU WERE MOVING WE WHEN YOU WERE -- CONTEMPLATING MOVING THIS LEGISLATION. DO YOU EVER CROSS YOUR MIND THAT MAY BE. ONE OTHER OPTION MIGHT BE TO DRAW THIS INTO THE REALM OF THE REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENT. BETWEEN A MUNICIPALITY IN THE COUNTY. BECAUSE IN MY EXPERIENCE -- IN THOSE EARLIER CAPACITIES. EVERY YEAR EVERY TWO YEARS WE HAD A REVENUE TAX REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENT. ADEN AND OBVIOUSLY MOST YOU KNOW WITH THE WITH PROPERTY TAXES SOMEONE SO FORTH BUT IT NGUYEN INTO THE FORM OF CONTRACT VIA NEGOTIATION. AND I THINK THE EQUITIES FLOATED TO THE TOP IN THE REASON WHY THE EQUITIES FLOATED THE TOP IS THE COUNTY IS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL. THEN THE CITY. THE COUNTY PROVIDE SERVICES AT A LEVEL THE CITIES DO NOT -- FOR EXAMPLE MMHM MY UNDERSTANDING MOST CITIES OR A LOT OF CITIES DON'T PROVIDE SOCIAL SERVICES RIGHT. THE COUNTY DOES. BOB CITIES DO NOT HAVE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS -- ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES ARE -- THE CITY'S DON'T SO. WE'RE LOOKING FOR PARITY. AND IT'S SEDUCTIVE TO LOOK UPON THIS AS IF YOU DO THE WORK YOU SHOULD REAP THE REWARDS. BUT THAT IS NOT THE REALITY IN THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF OUR CITY MUNICIPALITY COUNTY. OUR RELATIONSHIP IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT SO THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT I THINK THE IDEA IS GOOD BUT DID YOU EVER. IN SOME POSE MY QUESTION -- THROUGH THE CHAIR OF SHE SO WISHES TO YOU DID YOU EVER CONSIDER THERE MIGHT BE ALTERNATIVE -- IN MAKE IT IN THE FORM OF AN OF COUNTIES NEGOTIATING WITH THEIR CITIES OR VICE VERSA [inaudible] LET. LET ME JUST. BEFORE FROM JUMP I WOULD SAY THAT YOUR YOUR EXPERIENCES ON THE LOCAL LEVEL WOULD NOT BE APPLICABLE IN THIS SITUATION BECAUSE THE SIZE FIFTY YOU'RE. ABOUT. IS THE SAME CONCEPT IT IS SIMILAR CONCEPTS BUT HE AYE AYE AND STILL I DON'T THINK IT'S APPLES TO APPLES WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THREE EXTREMELY LARGE CITIES. I WOULD TELL YOU THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS IS REVENUE SHARING IF YOU THE COUNTY RIGHT IT IS NOT A HAPPY SHARE YOU SHARE THE CITY WOULD SHARE THE REVENUE WITH THE COUNTY CURRENTLY THIS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IS THAT IS NOT RECIPROCATED -- WITH THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE DONE SOME WORK YOUR REVENUE SHARING BUT THE CITY THE COUNTY WOULD DO IT IF THERE IS A SHARED EFFORT -- THERE ARE EXISTING EFFORTS WERE NEGOTIATIONS ARE DONE TO DO REVENUE SHARING THAT'S THE STATE OF PLAY TODAY THE PROBLEM SIMPLY IS WHEN THE COUNTIES BEING THE ACTIONS THE CITY SHARES AND NONE OF THAT -- IF THE COUNT OF THE CITY DOES ALL THE WORK THE COUNTY ALWAYS SHARE AND HALF OF THAT THAT MAKES SENSE AND RICK GERMAN YOU YOU YOU RE YOU PROPERLY RESTATED THE THE RUB. BY BUT MY QUESTION IS OUTSTANDING STILL IS WAS THAT EVER CONTEMPLATED AS A WAY OF GETTING YOU GUYS THROUGH THIS OR POPULATION CENTERS OVER. SEVEN FIFTY GETTING YOU THROUGH THIS BECAUSE OF THIS IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT -- DEVELOPMENT IN THE SEPARATION. OF COUNTY MUNICIPALITY RELATIONS. DID YOU EVER THINK THAT YOU NEGOTIATION IS IS A WAY FORWARD BY AMENDING THE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW. FOR SOME NEGOTIATED OUTCOME. IT IS TO SYNC ANSWERS NO SENATOR BUT YOU ALREADY HEARD THE ANSWER IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY THE COUNTY WOULD NOT SHARE THE PROCEEDS WITH THE CITIES THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN DOING. THIS BILL CREATES. A ENDS THE UNFAIRNESS AND CREATES EQUITY WHEN THEY'RE SHARED -- EFFORT MADE. OKAY -- HOLD ON THERE'S ANOTHER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR FOR YOUR COMMENTS -- ARE I THINK THAT AND THAT IS MY QUESTION THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SO I THINK THE CONCERN IS IF I MAY. A KNOWING IN DISCUSSING THIS WITH. SENATOR DORADO AND ENTER HER QUESTIONS AND ALL THEIR CONCERN IS. DAD IF THE COUNTY IF YOU WILL WE'RE TO GO COLD TURKEY. HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE DOING THEIR WRK WHAT I HEARD THE LA CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE SAY AND I'VE DISCUSSES WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY DIRECTLY IT IS NOT HIS INTENT? TO ESSENTIALLY CLOSE OUT AND KEEP THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE COUNTY OF LA OUT OF THESE. EFFORTS -- ON THE OTHER HAND IF THAT WERE TO TAKE PLACE THE COUNTY WOULD LOSE ITS ABILITY TO FUNCTION UNLESS THE COUNTY WERE MORE ARGUABLY MORE PROACTIVE IN BROUGHT ITS OWN CASES. MY HOPE IS THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER. TO THE EXTENT THAT BENEFITS THE CONSUMERS. OUR IN THIS AND SO -- IF THERE IS A TIE I THINK WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS. IN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND I THINK SENATOR RAZA WAS ARTICULATED AS WELL AND AND ACTUALLY I THINK EVERYBODY HERE WHAT WE GOT TO KEEP WORKING TOGETHER WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM HERE. TRYING TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER SO -- THE BILL IT CURRENTLY IS A THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR -- PERHAPS DID. IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THAT NOW OR IF WE CONTINUE THIS PERHAPS A WEEK AND GET SOME KIND OF AGREEMENT THE EITHER THE TO DELAY. IMPLEMENTATION PERHAPS A YEAR SO THAT THE DA'S OFFICE CAN. SORT OF TRY TO IDENTIFY SOME MECHANISMS BY WHICH IT MIGHT WORK WITH YOU -- IN THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO DO SOME WORK SHARING. VERSES -- RESULTS SHARING. OR ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS WAS -- TO HAVE A A SORT OF A REVISIT ON THIS IN A COUPLE YEARS TWO TO THREE YEARS TO SEE HOW IT'S GOING AS A TRUST A COUPLE OPTIONS HI. YOU KNOW I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS I WANT TO TAKE EVERYBODY AT THEIR WORD BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF EVERYBODY. BUT I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT OUT THERE AND AS CENTER MONEY IF YOU'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT THINK ON THAT POINT MADAM CHAIR AND BE CURIOUS WHAT THE AUTHOR THINKS AS WELL BUT I THINK THE AMENDMENT. THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN BY THE AUTHOR. PROVIDES THAT MECHANISM ALREADY IF THE COUNTY WANTS TO GUARANTEE ITS CONTINUED SHARE THEY NEED ONLY PARTICIPATE. AT THE INVESTIGATIVE LEVEL OF THE CASE. THEY'RE GUARANTEED HALF IS I READ THE CURRENT BILL SO THAT IS CORRECT ABOUT ECONOMIC IMPACT. THEY NEED ONLY PARTICIPATE WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY. IN THE INVESTIGATION OF A PENDING CASE. I GUESS THE ONLY QUESTION IS WOULD THE CITY ATTORNEY WANT TO KEEP DOING THAT WHEN AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY COULD GET THE FULL NINE YARDS OR THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE SETTLEMENT. VERSUS HAVING TO SHARE IT AND IN TALKING WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY HE SAID HE IS MORE THAN HAPPY TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE WITH THE COUNTY -- AND I THINK THAT'S IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN I THINK WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE HERE. BUT THEN PERHAPS. THERE MIGHT BE A DISCARDED. TO REVISIT THIS AT SOME POINT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER AGAIN A SOME KIND OF I HESITATE TO SAY SUNSET BUT SOME KIND OF PERHAPS OF REPORTING. SO THAT WE CAN SEE HOW THIS IS ALL WORKING WOULD THAT BE SOMETHING THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD BE WILLING TO DO. FOR YOU AND THE COMMITTEE HAVE MY IRON CLAD COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS WITH ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THIS MATTER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE MOST AGREEABLE OUTCOME FOR CONSUMERS -- I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS BILL ADVANCE TODAY I APPRECIATE CEREMONIES REFERENCE TO THE AMENDMENT THAT I HAVE ALREADY ACCEPTED IT AND I ASK MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TAKE THAT AS A TOKEN OF FAITH. AGAIN THEY DO THE MINIMALIST AMOUNT OF WORK AND THEY'RE GONNA GET HALF OF THE AWARD A RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK IS A SHOW OF MY FAITH WANTED TO DO SOMETHING GOOD IN THIS SPACE. A WE CAN CONTINUE EXPLORE THE CONCEPTS HAVE ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE ON THIS BILL NEEDS TO BEFORE MADAM CHAIR IT'S THE BEST THING FOR CONSUMERS CALIFORNIA. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SENATOR OF BOARD JUST ONE LAST QUESTION HERE AND I'D WE NORMALLY DON'T SPEAK TWICE BUT I I DO HAVE TO MAKE A COMMENT -- BASE TO ONE MADE EARLIER. THERE IS A TENSION IN INSTITUTIONAL TENSION THAT EXISTS BETWEEN MUNICIPALITIES AND COUNTIES. THE IDEA OF PARTICIPATING AT THE INVESTED INVESTIGATORY STAGES. I THINK IT SOUNDS NICE I DON'T THINK OUR THAT ONCE SOMETHING LIKE THIS DEVELOPS. THAT THE THE TERRITORIAL ISM. WILL GO AWAY IN FACT IT WILL INCREASE. AND THAT THAT IS THAT IS MIKE MY CONCERN MY CONCERN. AND IT BUT I THINK THE CHEER I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S AT RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK. IF THERE WERE A WAY OF PUTTING A A SUNSET. THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THIS TO DEVELOP WITHOUT BEING BOUND BY THE CONSEQUENCES AND HAVING TO RE INITIATE I THINK THAT COULD BE A GOOD WAY FOR AN ITEM WHICH I I COMMEND THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING [inaudible] YOUR YOU YOU'RE SWINGING FOR THE FENCES AND I LIKE IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THE STATE LEVEL BUT WHEN THIS IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THIS IS REALLY WHERE THE CLAUSE IN THE TEETH COME OUT. IT'S VERY INTERESTING DYNAMIC -- BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU -- MY ONLY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT IF YOU WERE TO PUT A SUNSET IN THERE I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS WOULD PROBABLY LOOK UPON THAT AS FRUITFUL AND ALLOW FOR MORE ENGAGEMENT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER UP WHAT I'M GONNA DO SAYS I'M GOING TO URGE THAT WE MOVE THE BILL. ON YOUR COMMITMENT AND MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT YOU ARE MEN OF GOOD FAITH AND YOU WILL HONOR YOUR WORD IN THE CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE YOU'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS HERE. EVERYBODY WANTS YOU TO SUCCEED ALL OF US TO SUCCEED WE NEED TO HAVE A ROBUST ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. OUT THERE SO. I'M GOING TO SUGGEST THAT -- WITH YOUR PROMISE AND IN GOOD FAITH TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION THAT WE A PASS THIS BILL AND THAT YOU WILL INDEED CONTINUE TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS LAST REMAINING ISSUE AND AND APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS UP TO NOW TO DO THAT SO. IS OUR MOTION MOTION BY A SENATOR TO RISE SO -- AND WE WILL LOCK -- MOVE FOR THE VOTE ON THIS THE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE LA TIMES BROKE THE STORY AS A COVER UP BY U. S. C.. REGARDING SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OF STUDENT PATIENTS BY TYNDALL AT YOU ARE SO YOU STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. HE STARTED AT USC IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND OVER THE YEARS IT IS ESTIMATED THAT OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND FEMALE STUDENTS WERE IMPACTED.

QUIETLY PAID TEN DAHLE TO GO AWAY AND FAILED TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FINDINGS OF THEIR INVESTIGATION. TO THE STUDENTS TO THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA OR TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THISBILL ALLOWS VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT THEIR DAY IN COURT BY EXEMPTING FROM THE CURRENT STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. CLAIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AT STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN BARRED PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE COUNTLESS VICTIMS WITHOUT RECOURSE. THESE INCLUDE THE CURRENT AND FORMER U. S. C. STUDENTS WHO ARE VICTIMIZED BY DR KENDALL. FAILURE TO DISCLOSE AND BRING TO LIGHT COMPLAINTS OF DOCTOR TYNDALE'S SEXUAL ASSAULT ON STUDENTS ALLOWED HIM TO CONTINUE TO ASSAULT. THOUSANDS OF WOMEN FOR YEARS. IT IS VITAL THE SURVIVORS ARE PROVIDED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT AND THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR. FOR SURVIVORS TO SEEK JUSTICE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS NICOLE HANSON I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB. FIFTEEN TEN DURING MY TIME AT USC I SERVED AS CAPTAIN OF THE TRACK TEAM. SPECIALIZING IN THE HEPTATHLON WHICH IS SEVEN EVENTS COMPETED OVER TWO DAY PERIOD. I WAS THE PAC TEN CHAMPION SILVER MEDALIST OF THE NC DOUBLE A CHAMPIONSHIPS COMPETED AT THE OLYMPIC TRIALS. AND IN THE DECADE AFTER GRADUATION BECAME A PRO TRACK ATHLETE. AFTER RETIRING I BECAME A SPORTS JOURNALIST AND FOR A TIME COVERED USC SPORTS. I AM A TROJAN TO THE CORE AND THAT'S WITH MADE. COMING FORWARD TO SPEAK ABOUT THE ABUSE THEY SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF DOCTOR TYNDALL SO. INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. I'M AN OVERALL VERY HEALTHY PERSON I VERY RARELY GET SICK -- ACTUALLY NEVER MISSED A DAY OF SCHOOL FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL DUE TO ILLNESS SO THAT'S WHY THE MEMORY OF THE ENCOUNTER I HAD WITH DOCTOR TYNDALL. IS SO VIVID. IT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE DURING MY JUNIOR YEAR IN COLLEGE. I WENT TO THE S. C. HEALTH CENTER BECAUSE I WAS EXPERIENCING DIARRHEA. AND THE MOST EXCRUCIATING STOMACH PAIN HAD EVER FELT. IT WAS THERE THAT I CAME UNDER THE CARE OF DOCTOR TYNDALL. I WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN. I JUST WANTED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF MY ILLNESS. SO I COULD BE TREATED IN THE PAIN WOULD JUST GO AWAY. WHEN I WAS TOLD TO GET UNDRESSED? AND TO PUT MY LEGS UP IN THE STIRRUPS. I COMPLIED. THE EXPERIENCE IT WASN'T EASY BY ANY MEANS -- IN ADDITION TO THE ALMOST BLINDING STOMACH PAIN THAT I WAS EXPERIENCING -- I WAS PUT THROUGH THE ORDEAL OF A FULL A VAGINAL EXAM. THAT WAS MY FIRST GYNECOLOGICAL VISIT AND I WAS A VIRGIN AT THE TIME. AFTER HE WAS DONE WITH MY EXAM. HE CAME UP. AND SAID. YOU HAD FOOD POISONING. GO BACK TO YOUR DORM AND IT'LL PASS IN A COUPLE HOURS. I WAS VERY CONFUSED WHY I HAD TO GO THROUGH A FULL VAGINAL EXAM JUST FOR SIMPLE FOOD POISONING. DIAGNOSIS. BUT YOU KNOW I TRUSTED THE DOCTOR. AND I DIDN'T QUESTION IS ACTIONS. BUT NOTHING ABOUT THAT DAY THAT WILL MY SPIRIT. I'VE BEEN TO MILLIONS OF DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS AND I'VE YOU KNOW. I'VE I REMEMBER THIS ONE LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL I STARTED READING ABOUT THE STORIES. OF DOCTOR TEN THE LAST YEAR. IN THE NEWSPAPER THAT. MY CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE BECAME CRYSTAL CLEAR. DR TYNDALL VIOLATED ME. I WAS PUT THROUGH THE ORDEAL FOR VAGINAL EXAM FOR SOMETHING TOTALLY. AND RELATED TO MY DISEASE HE PRAYED ON MY YOUTH. AND MY NAY OF IT TODAY. LIKE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED OF MY TROJAN SISTERS. I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY SOMEONE WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY TRUSTED DOCTOR. A DOCTOR THAT USC KEPT EMPLOYED AND ALLOWED TO TREAT YOUNG WOMEN LIKE ME. LONG AFTER REPORTS OF ABUSE HAVE BEEN REPORTED. MY MOTHER WAS ABUSED AS A CHILD AND SHE ALWAYS IMPRESSED UPON ME IF SOMEBODY EVER VIOLATED ME TO SPEAK UP. I NOW HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND I'M CONSTANTLY TALKING WITH HER ABOUT HOW SHE SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T BE TOUCH. SO I JUST I HAD TO SPEAK UP. AND COME FORWARD AND NOT JUST FOR ME BUT FOR MY MOM AND FOR THE HUNDREDS OF USC WOMEN WHO. HAVE SAT IN THEIR SHAME FEAR AND MISTRUST BECAUSE OF THE VIEWS THEY SUFFERED BY SOMEONE WHO IS SUPPOSED TO CARE FOR THEM. THE SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING. WHEN THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS? THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN WHEN THOSE GOOD NURSES WHO REPORTED THIS HORRENDOUS CONTENT CONDUCT WERE MET WITH INACTION OR EVEN WORSE A COVER UP. THE SYSTEMIC FAILURE IS CONTINUING AND NOW AS WE TRY TO BRING OUR CASE TO A COURT OF LAW. THE ENTITY THAT ALLOWED THE ABUSE UFC. IS CLAIMING THAT ARE QUE DEADLINES AND STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS LIMIT OUR RIGHTS AND OUR VOICES. I REMEMBER WHEN THE WHOLE LARRY NOW SORRY USA GYMNASTICS. STORY BROKE OUT WITH. SECOND I CAN BELIEVE USA GYMNASTICS ALLOW THIS MAN TO VIOLATE THESE YOUNG WOMEN FOR SO MANY YEARS AND ME BEING. AN ATHLETE I WAS TOTALLY INTO IT I WAS WATCHING EVERY DAY I SAW THOSE YOUNG GIRLS TESTIFY AND I WAS SO PROUD THAT THEY GOT UP THERE. LO AND BEHOLD I AM IN THE SAME SITUATION AND I NEVER GOT MY DAY IN COURT I NEVER GOT TO FACE THIS MAN AND ASK ISSUE WHY YOU ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN. AB FIFTEEN TEN GIVE SURVIVORS LIKE ME. WHO HAVE COME FORWARD A CHANCE TO HOLD THOSE WHO HARM DEATH ACCOUNTABLE? IT GIVES US A CHOICE. WE CAN CHOOSE OUR OWN PATH TO JUSTICE. USC'S UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT GOVERNMENT VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO PASS A RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT AB. FIFTEEN TEN I URGE YOU TO JOIN ME. MY ASIAN SISTERS MY AFRICAN AMERICAN SISTERS MY LATINO SISTERS MY ANGLE SISTERS. PLEASE PLEASE SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT BILL. OH AND ONE LAST REQUEST -- I HAVE COPIES OF THE USC RESOLUTIONS HERE CAN THE SERGEANT PLEASE DISTRIBUTE WILL ASK THE SERGEANT TO DO THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK INCREASED SO MUCH. IN YOUR HERE TO ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS OR DID YOU WANT TO TESTIFY AS WELL. ALL RIGHT PLEASE. BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD. I COULD AFTERNOON CHAIR IN MEMBERS MY NAME IS MY NAME IS YOU KNOW AND I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB. FIFTEEN TEN I WAS A FRESHMAN WHEN I WENT TO THE U. S. C. HEALTH CENTER FOR A CONSULTATION ABOUT THE BIRTH CONTROL METHOD I WAS TAKING. I REQUESTED A FEMALE GYNECOLOGIST BUT WAS TOLD THAT DR TUNNEL WAS THE ONLY CAMPUS GYNECOLOGIST. WHEN I RIDE FOR MY APPOINTMENT DOCTOR TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY ASKED ME IF I WAS JAPANESE? I CAN TELL BY YOUR LAST NAME HE SAID. DOCTOR TO KNOW THEN ASKED IF I HAD DONE A PELVIC EXAMINATION BEFORE I HAD NOT HE REACTED AS IF THIS WAS LUDICROUS AND INSISTED I NEEDED TO HAVE ONE DONE THAT DAY. I BELIEVED IN HIS CREDIBILITY AS A DOCTOR'S SO I ALLOWED HIM TO TAKE ME TO THE EXAMINATION ROOM. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A CHAPERONE IN THE ROOM AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. AS HE PULLED MY LEGS APART AND SECURED MAY FEET IN THE STIRRUPS HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT EAST ASIA AGAIN. AND AS HE STARTED HIS EXAMINATION HI. HE COMMENTED ON THE AESTHETICS OF MY BODY. HE TOUCHED MY BREAST AND THEN AS HE INSERTED HIS FINGERS INSIDE OF ME OVER AND OVER HE ASKED ME WHAT WAS WOMEN'S SEX LIFE WAS LIKE. HOW IT FELL DURING SEX IF I ENJOYING SEX AND IF I HAD A BOYFRIEND? I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT AT THE TIME U. S. YOU HAD ALREADY RECEIVED RECEIVED DECADES OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST THIS THE DOCTOR. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT USC HAD HIRED A TEAM OF MEDICAL EXPERTS TO EVALUATE HIM. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEIR REPORT CONCLUDED THAT DOCTOR TYNDALL PREYED ON ASIAN STUDENTS WHO. BECAUSE OF CULTURAL REASONS ARE LESS LIKELY TO RECOGNIZE HER HUSBAND OR LODGE A COMPLAINT. I DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THIS BUT U. S. C. DID. AND STILL THEY DID NOT NOTIFY LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THE STATE MEDICAL BOARD OF ITS INTERNAL REPORT. TWO MONTHS AGO I MET WITH FELLOW SURVIVORS OF DOCTOR TO KNOW SEXUAL ABUSE THERE WERE WOMEN IN THEIR SIXTIES TO WOMEN IN THEIR EARLY TWENTIES LIKE ME. ARE ONLY COMMON DENOMINATOR DENOMINATORS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THAT WE IDENTIFIED AS WOMAN AND AS TROJANS. BUT ALL OF THAT WAS OVERSHADOWED BY THE FACT THAT WE ALSO SHARE THE SAME ABUSER. DR DENTALS ABUSE CONTINUED YEAR AFTER YEAR AND DECADE AFTER DECADE. I SPOKE WITH WOMAN LIKE MISS HAYES WHO HAD REPORTED THEIR ABUSE TO USC BEFORE I WAS EVEN BORN. I AM STILL IN SHOCK NO THE NUMBERS IS ONE THING. TO MEET THE WOMAN TO KNOW THE WOMAN AND TO CONSIDER THEM MY SISTERS SURVIVORS IS ANOTHER. BY THE TIME OTHERS OTHERS CHOSE TO LISTEN IT WAS TOO LATE BUT WITH AB FIFTEEN TEN WE HAVE A CHANCE TO ALLOW MY FELLOW SURVIVORS. TO AT LEAST ACCESS LEGAL JUSTICE. LAST MONTH I BECAME A GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND JOIN THE RANKS OF OTHER ALUMNI. IN DOING SO I REFLECTED AS TO WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A PART OF THE TROJAN FAMILY. I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT TO BE A TROJAN MEANS TO TRULY EMBODY OUR SCHOOL MOTTO. TO NOT JUST FIGHT ON BUT TO FIGHT ON FOR SOMETHING THAT MATTERS. IN THIS CASE TO STAND WITH SURVIVORS IN TO DEMAND JUSTICE. I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT OUR FIGHT THANK YOU [inaudible] VERY MUCH.

GOOD AFTERNOON MICHELLE WELCOME ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND IN OPPOSITION TO AB. FIFTEEN TEN SHORTLY AFTER THE FIRST FEDERAL CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WAS FILED. THE UNIVERSITY ENTER INTO MEDIATION TO BEGIN TO PUT TOGETHER A COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT PACKAGE THAT WOULD COMPENSATE. EVERY SINGLE WOMAN WHO SAW DOCTOR TYNDALL. IT ALSO INCLUDED SWEEPING INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS THAT MAKE USC A SAFER ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL U. S. C. STUDENTS. US HE HAS COMMITTED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THE FEDERAL SETTLEMENT THAT WILL PROVIDE. EVERY WOMAN WHO SAW DOCTOR TYNDALE A PRIVATE RESPECTFUL AN EXPEDITED REMEDY. MONTHS AFTER NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN UNDERWAY. AND ONLY AFTER THE SETTLEMENT WAS FILED IN FEDERAL LAWSUIT WAS A. B. FIFTEEN TEN INTRODUCED. THE AUTHORS CLAIM THAT THE BILL IS NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR WOMEN WHO ARE CURRENTLY BARRED BY THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS. TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR THEIR INJURIES. THIS BILL. IS NOT NECESSARY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. THE AUTHOR HAS ALSO STATED. THAT THIS BILL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE USC HAS ENGAGED IN FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT. WE DISPUTE THAT ASSERTION. AND EVEN IF THAT WERE TO BE THE CASE [inaudible] CURRENT LAW. HOLD THE REMEDY IN THOSE CASES. SO THEN WHY ARE WE HERE. WHY DOES THIS PARTICULAR SETTLEMENT? REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE INTERVENTION. IT IS OUR POSITION THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS THE APPROPRIATE VENUE. TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE SETTLEMENT IS FAIR AND REASONABLE. AND JUST LAST WEEK ON THURSDAY WE HAD A FEDERAL JUDGE WHO AFTER. REVIEWING REAMS OF EVIDENCE. OF DATA OF STATEMENT. GRANTED THIS SETTLEMENT PRELIMINARY APPROVAL. MADE PUBLIC COMMENTS. THAT THIS SETTLEMENT IS IN FACT FAIR AND REASONABLE. THIS IS WHY USC OPPOSES AB FIFTEEN TEN AND THE DANGEROUS PRECEDENT THAT IT SUCKS. YOUR ANALYSIS ACCURATELY STATES. BUT YES THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE DISCRETION TO RETROACTIVELY OPEN UP STATURE LIMITATIONS HOWEVER IT CAUTIONS AS DO THE COURTS. THAT THAT DISCRETION SHOULD BE USED SPARINGLY. THIS SITUATION DOES NOT RISE TO THAT LEVEL [inaudible] THANK YOU. CAN I JUST REALLY WRAP UP THE WHO WOULD. WHERE THEY GOT MORE TIME THEY HAD A STORY TO TELL YOU'RE DEFENDING THE SITUATION I WANT TO GIVE YOU TIME SO OUR APP WRAP IT UP PLEASE? SO -- LAWCENTER THOUGHT I WOULD ASK FOR YOU TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT IF IT IS. IF IT IS. SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY THEN WHY IS LIMITED TO PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES IN ADDITION I WOULD ASK THE CONSIDER WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE IS THE SHOULD HAVE THE ROLE OF SUPPLANTING A THOUGHTFUL TRADITIONAL ANALYSIS THAT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE SETTLEMENT IS FAIR AND REASONABLE AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK THAT YOU VOTE NO.

TELL US TO BE APPROPRIATE TIME. FOR THE IN BETWEEN. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT. EIGHT HI ALEX GRAVES WITH THE ASSOCIATION INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES WE DON'T HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION ON THE BILL I WE DO HAVE TWO CONCERNS AS WANTED BRIEFLY SHARE -- ONE OF WHICH HAS BEEN MATCH I THINK BY NUMBER OF FOLKS FOR ME AND THE OTHER IS JUST -- BURNHAM OF OUR SCHOOLS THE CHALLENGE TO POTENTIALLY GO BACK UP TO THIRTY YEARS -- IN GATHERING EVIDENCE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES HAVE OPPOSE YOUR ANY WITNESSES NEUTRAL ON THIS. AFTER BRUCE RIVERS LOS BANOS CALIFORNIA MERCED COUNTY FORMER STUDENT AT MONTEREY PENINSULA JUNIOR COLLEGE LANEY JUNIOR COLLEGE AND CAL STATE UNIVERSITY NORTHRIDGE WHICH HAD THE NUMBER ONE DIVISION ONE MEN'S TRACK TEAM BACK IN THE DAY. AND I KNOW THIS A MORE TEN DALE'S OUT THERE BECAUSE I HEARD STORIES AS I WAS GOING TO COLLEGE IN THE SEVENTIES FORTY ONE YEARS AGO AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL UNLESS IT INCLUDES ALL. STATE UNIVERSITIES ALL UC'S SINKING AND ALL JUNIOR COLLEGE THANK YOU SIR. OKAY LET'S BRING IT BACK. TO THE TABLE THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY EMOTIONAL ISSUE YOU KNOW. ALL OF US. AS WOMEN HAVE BEEN THROUGH WHAT IS ALMOST INHERENTLY A SOMEWHAT HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE OF GOING THROUGH A GYNECOLOGICAL EXAM IT IS. AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE MOMENTS IN ONE'S LIFE AND TO HAVE. INJURED THIS EXPERIENCE IS OF JUST THE TAKES MY BREATH WAY AND SO I APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY. OF ALL OF YOU THEIR MEANING FULL AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHERS THAT. THIS KIND OF TREATMENT OF WOMEN IS GONE ON SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND HOPEFULLY NOW WE ARE WE'RE GONNA STOP IT. UP. IT'S JUST NOT A IT'S IT'S BEYOND DISTASTEFUL I THOUGHT THAT WAS ONE OF THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE DAY IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR. SO YOUR TESTIMONY COMING FORWARD REALLY MEANS A LOT. AND I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THAT THE ABUSE HERE WAS JUST ABOMINABLE AND AND WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THIS TRUST DOESN'T HAPPEN. EVER AGAIN GOING FORWARD AND CERTAINLY LOOKING BACK TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE. CLEARLY DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE OF THIS MAN'S BEHAVIOR OVER THE COURSE OF THIRTY YEARS -- I THINK WHAT IS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN. AND I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR -- TO TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS IS THE FACT THAT NOT ONLY DID THIS HAPPEN. BUT THAT THE UNIVERSITY WAS WELL AWARE OF THIS AND ALLOWED IT TO CONTINUE FOR YEARS [inaudible] THAT. OF IT WE KNOW THEIR PERPETRATORS OUT THERE WE KNOW THERE. ARE -- DEVIANCE WE KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WOMEN OR YOUNG PEOPLE VULNERABLE PEOPLE BUT FOR AN INSTITUTION WHICH HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY. TO PROTECT US WHETHER IT'S THROUGH MAKING SURE WE GET A QUALITY EDUCATION WHETHER IT'S THE PROVISIONS OF TITLE. NINE WHETHER IT'S JUST BASIC HUMAN DECENCY. WE HAVE A AN ENORMOUS LAPSE THAT OCCURRED HERE AND SO EXCUSE ME. OUR WE SOMETIMES HEAR THAT FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE INDIVIDUALS BUT NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE AS WITNESSES SO PLEASE [inaudible] THANK YOU. SO WE KNOW THAT -- THERE'S BEEN A FAILURE THIS INSTITUTION THERE ARE PROBABLY BEEN FAILURES OF OTHERS AND PERHAPS WE WILL LEARN OF THOSE GOING FORWARD BUT THE QUESTION NOW BEFORE US IS WHETHER THIS BILL. IS THE RIGHT WAY TO RESPOND TO THE ISSUES BEFORE US STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS ARE I PRACTICED LAW FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS -- RECOVERING -- BEEN IN RECOVERY FOR ABOUT THE SAME LENGTH OF TIME WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY HERE WHO HAVE PRACTICED LAW. IN THOSE WHO -- I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN PUBLIC POLICY FOR PERIODS OF TIME EVEN IF THEY HAVEN'T SO. IT IS -- UNDERSTOOD THAT STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS AND OUR RELIANCE ON THEM ARE FOUNDATIONAL TO OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE DON'T WANT CASES TO GET TOO STALE WITNESSES MEMORIES CHANGE. OF PEOPLE DIE SO A HAVING STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS ARE A FOUNDATION OF OUR JUDICIAL PROCESS AS ANCIENT AS FOR EXISTED AS LONG BACK AS FAR BACK AS ANCIENT ROME. AND WHILE THE LAW IS CLEAR THAT IT IS WITHIN THE POWER OF THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIVE EXPIRED CIVIL CLAIMS WE'VE DONE THAT BEFORE WE'VE DONE THAT WITH THE MISTREATMENT OF HORRIFIC TREATMENT WITHIN THE CHURCH. AND A SEXUAL PREDATORS OF THE CHURCH KNEW ABOUT FOR DECADES IF NOTHUNDREDS OF YEARS WE'VE DONE IT THERE SO -- WE HAVE IN FACT REVIVED EXPIRED CIVIL CLAIMS IN THE PAST THE QUESTION TODAY IS WHETHER IT'S JUSTIFIED IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION BEFORE US. AND I THINK THAT THE SITUATIONS IN THE CLAIMS THAT ARE COVERED BY THIS BILL. DO WARRANT THIS EXTRAORDINARY RELIEF READING THE STORIES OVER AND OVER AGAIN -- YOU ARE NOT ALONE AND AS I SAID EARLIER THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT. AND A YOUNG WOMEN. THE WOMEN WHO'VE EXPERIENCES SHOULD NOT BEAR. THE GUILT OF THIS MISTREATMENT AND YET WE AS WOMEN DO. I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT WE DO -- WEATHER WHERE THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL ABUSE RAPE -- OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE FEEL THAT IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY. AND IT IS NOT BUT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THESE UNIVERSITIES AND ANY INSTITUTION THAT IS AWARE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TO TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS. TO ENDED [inaudible] AND SO. A I DON'T MAKE THAT DECISION LIGHTLY BECAUSE AGAIN TO SOMEONE WHO BELIEVED SO FIRMLY IN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS -- THIS IS A SITUATION THAT. THAT I THINK BEGS THE THE RESPONSE AND IN RESPONSE TO THE CONCERN ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE'S A TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT ON THE TABLE. IF THE SETTLEMENT IS FAIR AND REASONABLE FOR VICTIMS THEY WON'T OPT OUT THEY'LL PARTICIPATE BUT THIS BILL AS I UNDERSTAND IT GIVES THOSE WHO HAVE TIME BARRED CLAIMS. A CHOICE. TO TAKE THE SETTLEMENT OFFER OR TO SEEK JUSTICE IN THE COURTS PURSUANT TO THE REVIVAL PROVISION. THEY HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY I FRANKLY THINK TWO HUNDRED AND USC IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET. UP BUT IT IS A SETTLEMENT THAT WAS OFFERED IN THE CORD. DID -- TO APPROVE THE SETTLEMENT THEN SO BE IT FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE AND MAYBE FOR GOOD REASON BUT I THINK FOR THOSE. ARE FOR WHOM THE STATUTE HAS RUN IF THEY WANT TO ASSERT THEIR CLAIMS GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW AND GIVEN WHAT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEW. ARE THEY SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THIS AND AS FAR AS EXPANDING THIS PERHAPS GOING FORWARD. IF THERE ARE OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE THE FAX SERVICES GREGIS AS THEY ARE IN THIS CASE THAT WOULD HAPPEN AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT EVERY SCHOOL IN EVERY INSTITUTION THAT IS GIVEN THE TRUST OF ITS STUDENTS OR ITS POPULATION -- IF THEY HAVE -- OF NOT THE CARED FOR THEIR STUDENTS OR THEIR POPULATION AS THEY SHOULD. THEIR DUTIES TO THEIR TO THEIR CONGREGANTS WHAT HAVE YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE AND PROCEED APPROPRIATELY GOING FOR TO THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN ONE MORE DAY IN THE FUTURE -- I HOPE THERE WILL HAPPEN AS WELL AND SO -- THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS ON THIS SUBJECT I RECOGNIZE -- THEIR POINTS OF VIEW PASSIONATELY ON BOTH SIDES BUT THIS KIND OF THING HAS JOSH GOT TO STOP. AND IF WE GIVE THESE VICTIMS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK THEIR JUSTICE I CERTAINLY FEEL THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WITH THAT I WOULD OPEN IT. THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. CENTER MONEY FALL BY SENATOR GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. OF WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES WHO SPOKE TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE SCOPE. OF THE BILL -- AS I THINK THE CHAIR BEGAN TO ASK BUT IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ABOUT INCLUDING. OF ALL. INSTITUTIONS OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING. SENATOR I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TO RECOGNIZE THE THE IMPETUS. FOR THIS BILL. IT IS WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT U. S. C. IT IS WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE PERIOD OF THIRTY YEARS IT IS A VICTIMS OF USC. THE FACT THAT THIS WAS A STORY THAT BROKE. IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT THE THE UNIVERSITY REACHED OUT TO THE VICTIMS AND SAID WE FOUND OUT THIS DOCTOR HAS DONE THIS AND WE NEED TO BRING IN ALL OF THE THE VICTIMS. THERE'S A STORY THAT BROKE IN THE LA TIMES. BECAUSE OF INVESTIGATION SHOWING THAT. THIS IS KNOWN BY USC AND WE HAVE. FOURTEEN THOUSAND WOMEN. WHO WERE SEEN BY THIS DOCTOR WHO WAS THE ONLY GYNECOLOGIST IN THIS -- STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. THE THIS BILL IS VERY SPECIFIC. TO THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND I THINK AS THE CHAIR HAS INDICATED IF WE FIND THAT. THIS HAS HAPPENED TO THAT DEGREE. WITH THE COVER UP. THAT WE FIND AT THIS UNIVERSITY. BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO RESPOND ACCORDINGLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU. THE CENTER GONZALEZ FOLLOWED BY SENATOR BORCHERS DID YOU HAVE A OKAY VERY GOOD TENOR GONZALEZ. AND I'M CHAIR AND THANK YOU -- FOR SHARING YOUR STORIES WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT -- I KNOW IT MUST BE VERY HARD AND TO COME IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE IS VERY DIFFICULT SO THANK YOU FOR FOR THAT -- I FIRST WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT -- REFERENCE IT MADE AND WHAT'S -- IF ANYTHING HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT THAT I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A REPORTS OF THE DECK THE DECADES OF REPORTS. THAT HAVE BEEN -- THAT REPORTED BUT NOTHING DON PAYMENTS TO THE COACH BUT ALL WHAT CAN YOU EXPLAIN -- ON THE FRAUDULENT CONCELMENT DIDN'T WEAR THAT. MAY TAKE US YES THANK YOU EXCUSE ME OPENS UP SORRY I THOUGHT TO THE RUSSIANS. ARE TO THE AUTHOR IN INTO THE WOODS THANK YOU FOR THE CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO ASK HOLLY BOYER THE ATTORNEY TO RESPOND TO THAT. HI. SO A COUPLE POSITIONS WITH THE FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT WOULD YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD PLEASE YES I'M SORRY HOLLY BOYER. ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR -- ONE IS THAT USC HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN THE EXACT OPPOSITE POSITION IN LITIGATION THEY ARE -- SEEKING TO DISMISS AND HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL DISMISSING CLAIMS WHERE THE PLAINTIFFS OF ARGUED THAT ARE DELAY DISCOVERY OR FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT HAVE -- STOPPED THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. BOTH OF THESE DOCTRINES OUR OUR FAX SPECIFIC HURDLES PLACED ON A VICTIM TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY WERE NOT ON NOTICE OF THEIR CLAIM EARLIER USC HAS POINTED TO FAX OF THESE VICTIMS WITH A STAY -- I SENSED THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG DURING THIS EXAMINATION TO SAY AHA YOU KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE SUSPECTED THIS WAS ABUSE THEREFORE YOU CANNOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT DOCTOR AN ORDERLY DISCOVERY TO TOLL YEARS TO STATURE LIMITATIONS. UNDER THEIR ANALYSIS THERE FRAUDULENT CONDUCT DOESN'T EVEN COME INTO PLAY AND IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE POINTING TO THE THE TYPE OF AND THE NATURE OF THIS ABUSE. AB FIFTEEN TEN GIVES THESE VICTIMS THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR OWN ACTION IN STATE COURT THAT'S ALL THIS BILL IS SEEKING TO DO IS OPEN THAT DOOR THANK YOU -- THAT CLARIFIES EVERYTHING FOR ME APPRECIATE THAT AND WHAT I'LL JUST SAY OUT WITH THAT AND I THINK JUST CHECK. ONE OTHER QUESTION BECAUSE I KNOW IN TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT WHICH IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN DOLLARS IT SEEMS. MILLION DOLLARS YES TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS -- WHICH DOES SEEM LIKE A DROP IN THE BUCKET I KNOW THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT TEARS AS WELL -- IN TERMS OF USC DETERMINING LIKE WHO EXACTLY -- WOULD GET WHAT AMOUNTS 225-002-5000 AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THERE'S A THREE MEMBER PANEL THAT WOULD DECIDE THAT. SO I JUST. JUST IN HEARING THAT TODAY I KNOW THAT -- WOMEN WHO ALREADY FEEL A MAJOR DISTRUST IN -- THIS UNIVERSITY WITH AND HAVE TO GO TO THIS PANEL I FEEL LIKE IS AN EXTRA BURDEN -- AND FOR THAT REASON -- I FEEL THE SAME WAY YOU KNOW I REALLY DO AND SO I WOULD WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN. AND I HOPE AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF MANY PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE HAD HERE TODAY -- I HOPE THAT WE CAN SET A REALLY GOOD PRESIDENT HERE IN THE STATE WHERE WE DO HAVE ADDITIONAL VICTIMS THAT CAN COME FORWARD AND VARIOUS OTHER -- EDUCATIONAL CAPACITIES THANK YOU. OF THE THREE ONE RESPOND TO THAT. BRIEFLY. I'M I THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT ACTIONS THE UNIVERSITY HAS TAKEN ONCE ALLEGATIONS HAVE RISEN WE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL OF YOUR OFFICES IN A LETTER THAT DETAILS. VERY SPECIFICALLY THE TIMELINE OF ALLEGATIONS MADE AGAINST OFTEDAL AND THE ACTIONS THAT U. S. HE TOOK AFTER EACH ALLEGATION. AND THE SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS AND AND ALSO JUST REMIND IF THIS IS A CASE ABOUT FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT AND IF USC IS BEING ACCUSED. OF ENGAGING IN THAT ACTIVITY THIS BILL IS NOT NECESSARY TO ALLOW THOSE WOMEN A REMEDY THERE IS A REMEDY IN CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW FOR THOSE PARTICULAR INSTANCES. I THINK THAT WAS EXPLAINED BY THE ATTORNEY A PREVIOUSLY. ESSIE HAS FOUGHT THIS INCLUDE QUARTZ -- VIGOROUSLY -- DENYING OF BEHAVIOR IT HAS NOT. I THINK EVEN TODAY AND HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED THE KIND OF REMORSE AND RECOGNITION -- THAT -- ITS VICTIMS OF BELIEVE IS APPROPRIATE SO -- AND I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER REASON THAT THE PEOPLE. ARE BELIEVED TO THE THIS IS AN INADEQUATE SETTLEMENT SO. THAT'S ART OF WHAT THIS BILL DOES SHE VERY UNIQUE SET OF FACTS. SET OF FACTS AND I THINK FOR SOME OF US THAT'S REALLY THE REASON WE'RE WILLING. TO DEAL WITH THE STATURE LIMITATIONS ISSUE. IN THIS FASHION SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU AND THE CHAIR WOMAN IS CORRECT -- THIS -- CERTAINLY IS A COMPLICATED SCARY -- ISSUE THAT ROLLS THE PASSIONS -- AS POLICY MAKERS I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT. WE DEVISE LEGISLATION IN APPROVED LEGISLATION. THAT IS APPLICABLE TO THE STATE. AND MY CONCERN IS WHEN WE HAVE CARVE OUT. OR ARE REALLY UNIQUE BOUTIQUE TYPES OF LEGISLATION THAT IT WORKS AGAINST WHAT I THINK OUR CORE MISSION IS IS TO LOOK AFTER. THE BETTERMENT OF THE STATE AND ALL ITS RESIDENTS. AND I'VE HEARD SOME EXPLANATION AS TO WHY S. C. AND I'M CERTAINLY NEVER GONNA DEFEND ESSIE. IN ANY CAPACITY IF THESE IF IF IF EVERYTHING THAT I'VE HEARD IS TRUE. IT'S A HORRIFIC. EVENT. BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE NOT APPLYING IT [inaudible] AS POLICY. TO ALL SCHOOLS. AND I'D I'D I KNOW THAT -- MY COLLEAGUE POSE THAT QUESTION BUT I'M NOT CERTAIN I UNDERSTOOD THE RESPONSE THAT I THAT I HEARD FROM THE AUTHOR OF OF THIS. MAYBE I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER SHOT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED -- WHAT IS THE HARM IN APPLYING THIS TO ALL UNIVERSITIES? IN IS THERE SOMETHING OTHER POLITICAL FORCES OUT THERE. THAT ARE MAKING THIS. MORE DIFFICULT TO DO SO. I THOUGHT I HAD RESPONDED BUT HOWEVER SENATOR I WILL ASK THE ATTORNEY -- TO GIVE IT A SHOT. TO SO ONE OF THE AS THE CHAIRPERSON NOTED IT'S BECAUSE OF THE AGREE JUST NATURE OF THE THIRTY YEARS THAT THREE DECADES OF ABUSE THAT OCCURRED HERE. THAT NOT ONLY ALLOWED IN PLACE UNTIL IN A POSITION TO SEXUALLY ABUSE THESE WOMEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN BUT ALSO THE COVER UP AS WELL. AS SIMILAR TO THE CHURCH CASES AROUND TWO THOUSAND TWO WHEN THERE WAS A LIMITED ONE YEAR REVIVAL PROVISION FOR SEXUAL ABUSE VICTIMS OF THOSE IN THOSE CHURCH CASES. THIS BILL TARGETS THE AGREE THE PASSAGES NECESSARY NOW BOTH BECAUSE ONE CLAIMS THAT ARE HAVE BEEN FILED ARE BEING DISMISSED BASED ON THE STATURE IMITATIONS GROUNDS. AND THE FEDERAL SETTLEMENT THAT WAS REFERRED TO EARLIER BY USC HAS AN OPT OUT PROVISION OF NOVEMBER SEVENTH SO IF THIS IF THIS BILL IS NOT PROVIDED TO GIVE THESE WOMEN THE CHANCE. THEY ARE DENIED THE CHOICE AND READING IN THE OLDER RESPECT IN YOUR ARTICULATING TO PROCEDURAL CIRCUMSTANCE OF S. C.. I'M LOOKING UPON THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS THAT SHOULD BE BORNE BY UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE. AND THAT'S WERE -- I DON'T I'M NOT FINDING SATISFACTION IN IN THIS ANSWER NGUYEN. WE HEARD TESTIMONY EVEN FROM THE CHAIR HERSELF AND I'LL QUOTE ANY UNIVERSITY -- TO TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH HER [inaudible] ALL UNIVERSITIES. AND IF THIS IS TRIGGERING A ARE DISCREET AREA OF TIME. THEN WHY NOT APPLY IT. ACROSS THE BOARD YOU'LL STILL ACHIEVE THE SAME RESULTS BUT WE WILL SEND PUBLIC POLICY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I I THINK THIS BILL IS VERY SPECIFIC IT IS TO TIME AND THAT IS WHAT THE BILL IS AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BRING ANOTHER BILL. DIFFERENT BILL THAT YOU CERTAIN NOW WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I'M RESPOND EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME COUNTY EXCUSE ME. I HAVE HI I AM ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION. THIS IS NOT A DIALOGUE I'M ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION. THIS IS A SPECIFIC BILL. DEALING WITH A SPECIFIC SET OF ISSUES AND I INVITE ANYONE WHO WISHES TO BRING THEIR OWN BILL DEALING WITH SOME OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS. THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DO THAT -- YOU DO SENATOR BORCHERS YOU CAN BRING YOUR OWN LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE AS WHAT WE DO IS LEGISLATORS. THIS BILL IS VERY NARROWLY FOCUSED. THE SET OF FACTS THE EXPANSION OF THE STATURE LIMITATIONS IS VERY LIMITED TO A PARTICULAR SET OF FACTS IF THERE ARE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COME FORWARD. THAT HAVE A SET OF FACTS THAT THE AUTHOR BELIEVES WOULD JUSTIFY THIS ADDITIONAL EXPANSION OF THE STATUTE. THEN THAT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT THIS. THERE WOULD COME TO THIS COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION SO. IF YOU WANT MY QUESTION DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION I DO RIGHT -- ONE THE YOU'VE NOT ANSWERED -- THE IDEA IS. AND WE EXT WE EXPECT THIS IN IN OUR IN OUR COMMITTEE IN OUR FORUM THAT IF SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IS PROPOSED AND BRING UP A SUBSEQUENT PIECE OF LEGISLATION FORWARD. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE EARLY. AN ODD THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. SO WHY DON'T I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WAS INCORPORATED INTO IT WHAT AM I MISSING WHAT ARE THE FORCES AT PLAY THAT IS OUR IS KEEPING THIS. FROM OCCURRING. MAY I JUST SAY. WHAT IN INJUSTICES WOULD BE? IF WE WERE TO INCLUDE OTHER UNIVERSITIES WHERE. HE THE ONLY ONE THAT COMES TO MIND NOW IS YOU SEE A LATE THIS IS JUST BEGINNING FOR UCLA. USC'S COVER UP USC'S VICTIMIZATION HAS BECOME. THE VICTIMS OF ALREADY BEEN NOTIFIED THEY'RE PART OF A CLASS ACTION SUIT. THAT HAS BEEN OVER OVER A YEAR THEY ARE NOW AWARE IF WE NOW SEE HERE'S THIS WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY UPS ARE YOU DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT IT. NOTHING WE CAN DO. THERE WAS A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND I'M A TROJAN. I I RECEIVED MY EDUCATION AT USC THIS WAS NOT AN EASY DECISION EVEN FOR MYSELF I STAND WITH MY SISTERS ALSO WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED IN THIS MANNER. U.. ACTIONS IN THIS CASE. HAVE PROVIDED THE NOTICE TO THE VICTIMS. THERE WILL BE A ONE YEAR. RE OPENING OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR THOSE VICTIMS AND DURING THAT YEAR IF THEY BRING THEIR CLAIM. PERFECT IF THEY DON'T THE STATURE IT WILL HAVE PASSED IF WE WERE TO EXPAND THIS TO EVER UNIVERSITY THAT WOULD BE SUCH A DISSERVICE TO THEM. THANK YOU I THINK YOU'VE ANSWERED THE QUESTION NOW SENATOR MORNING AND THEN I THINK AT THIS POINT WILL ASK YOU TO CLOSE AND WE WILL TAKE ABOUT. JUST BRIEFLY -- I THINK THAT IS THE DISTINCTION HERE FOR THOSE WHO SEEK THE SAME TREATMENT. TWO OTHER UNIVERSITIES [inaudible] WE WANT. VICTIMS TO HAVE THE FULL PANOPLY OF RIGHTS THIS IS TAILORED TO A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S ALREADY A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A WINDOW FOR VICTIMS IN THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT. THAT WINDOW FOR OTHER VICTIMS IN OTHER UNIVERSITIES IN ESSENCE WOULD BE SLAMMING THE DOOR. ON THEM TO HAVE THE FULL COURSE TO RUN THE POSSIBILITY. OF SEEKING JUSTICE AND THEIR RIGHTS THERE MAY BE OTHER INSTANCES WHERE THE INJUSTICE OF WHAT HAPPENED AT USC IS REVEALED AT THAT POINT. THEN IT'S APPROPRIATE TO EXPLORE DOES THAT WARRANT OPENING A WINDOW THIS WINDOWS FOR VICTIMS AT USC. THIS WINDOW APPLIED TO THE STATE WOULD BE CLOSING THE DOOR ON POTENTIAL REMEDIES TO OTHER VICTIMS. I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU SENATOR MONEY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU FOR THIS ROBUST CON CONVERSATION I THANK THE VICTIMS FOR COMING FORWARD IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO HEAR THEIR VOICE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

GIVE YOU ALL A MOMENT THE TOUGH COMMITTEE. HELLO WATCHING YOU GUYS THAT AREA GOOD AFTERNOON WE ARE ON OUR LAST ITEM FILE ITEM SEVENTEEN WHICH IS AB. SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE OF HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET OUR MEMBERS BACK -- SO THAT WHEN WE ARE DONE WITH THIS -- BE ABLE TO OF VOTE -- ON THIS ITEM AND CLOSE THE ROLES ON OTHERS SO -- THIS IS AB -- SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE OF REALLY YOU SEE BILL TWO WILL PROBABLY HAVE SOME ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT IT LOOKING FORWARD TO IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURNER **** BATH THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS TODAY IT'S MY HONOR TO PRESENT MY BILL AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WHICH APPROPRIATELY REGULATES. SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES COASTAL ZONE AS A THREE YEAR PILOT. I WHEN I THINK THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR CONSTRUCTIVE AMENDMENTS WHICH I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT TODAY. WE ALL KNOW TOO WELL THAT CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF A STATE WHAT HOUSING CRISIS. AND YOU ALL KNOW THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAME REGULATE OR BAN SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS AS THEY SEE FIT. THIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. EXCEPT IN THE OASTAL ZONE. AND THE COAST IS ON THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION HAS ABILITY TO REGULATE LAND USE BUT ONLY AS A PLACE TO COASTAL ACCESS. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BALANCE COASTAL ACCESS WITH HOUSING AFFORDABILITY OR IN THE CASE SOCIAL FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS REMOVING HOUSING FROM THE HOUSING STOCK. THEREFORE CAL IN CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL ZONE THE CALIFORNIA COAST MAKE COMMISSION THAT REQUIRES CITY TO HAVE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL. RESEARCHER VACATION RENTALS REGARDLESS OF THEIR AFFORDABILITY AND EVEN IN COUNTIES THAT DO AN EXCEPTIONAL JOB -- IN PROVIDING LOW COST COAST ACCOMMODATIONS LIKE SAN DIEGO COUNTY. SAN DIEGO COUNTY ACCOUNTS FOR NEARLY ONE THIRD OF THE STATE'S ENTIRE STOCK OF LOW COST COASTAL ACCOMMODATION. THAT MEANS ONE IN ONE THOUSAND PER ONE THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THIS IS FAR ABOVE THE REST OF THE STATE IN ANY OTHER COUNTY. AND SO WE DO A GOOD JOB OF PROVIDING LOW COST BECAUSE OF COMBINATIONS WE DO NOT HAVE A COASTAL LOW COST ACCOMMODATION PROBLEM THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY. BUT WE DO HAVE A CROWD HOUSING CRISIS EXACERBATED BY THE PROLIFERATION OF SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS WHICH ARE REMOVING HOUSING FROM OUR HOUSING STOCK. ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE POPULARITY EASE THROUGH WHICH THEY CAN BE RENTED OVER SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS -- AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY ISSUE WHEN IT AN ADVERT LEE INCENTIVIZE FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS OVER LONG TERM RENTALS WE SEE THAT. LONG TERM RENTAL RATES INCREASE AND IT'S JUST A SIMPLE SUPPLY AND DEMAND IF WE ALL GO BACK TO ECONOMICS ONE A ONE WE KNOW WHAT THIS IS. CURRENTLY THERE ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY MOST OF WHICH ARE FULL TIME. WE ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES COASTAL ZONE. AND WHEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STATE HOW IT WHAT HOUSING CRISIS WE ALLOW THE DE FACTO DEMOLITION OF FIVE THOUSAND UNITS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM. I NOT HAVE THEM BE REPLACED. THIS MEANS THERE FIVE THOUSAND UNITS NOT AVAILABLE TO BUY OR RENT LONG TERM FOR FAMILIES SENIORS VETERANS ARE WORKERS. DECREASE THE SUPPLY WHICH WE ON THOSE INCREASES RENT AND HOUSING PRICES. AND REMEMBER THESE UNITS ARE COUNTED IN CITIES RENO NUMBERS FOR HOUSING NOT VISITORS SERVING USES WHICH SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY ARE. WELL NOT ALL THESE RENTALS WILL BE AFFORDABLE I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THEY PUSH HIGHER INCOME FOLKS DOWN THE HOUSING MARKET WHICH THEIR FULLER FOR CAUSES DISPLACEMENT OF OUR FAMILIES THING YEARS VETERANS AND WORKERS. THIRTY TWO ADDRESSES MARKET DESTRUCTION I AUTHORED AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE IT'S NEARLY TAILORED TO PROBABLY REGULATE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS IN THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY COUNCILS ON AND I WANT TO GET AT THAT BECAUSE OF THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS. THAT ARE CAUSING THIS MASSIVE MARKET DISTORTION IN IMPERIAL BEACH WHICH IS ONE OF OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND ALSO WON THE POOREST CITIES IN THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY. THEY USE A LOT OF POLITICAL CAPITAL WE ALL KNOW IT'S HARD TO BUILD IN THE COASTAL ZONE -- AND THEY BUILT A TWO HUNDRED THEY APPROVED A TWO HUNDRED UNIT -- MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENT TWENTY FIVE OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED UNITS WITHIN THREE MONTHS OUR FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. I PREDICT IT'LL BE FIFTY BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THOSE WERE HOMES AND APARTMENTS MEANT FOR FOLKS THEY WERE NOT MEANT TO BE VISITORS SERVING USES AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE A PROLIFERATION AND THE SUCCESS REALLY OF THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS. ARE DOING TO OUR HOUSING MARKET AT SOME POINT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE REALLY HONEST DO WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS OR DO WE HAVE A SHORT TERM VACATION IN A CRISIS AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE. WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS. AT ITS CORE. AB SEVENTY THIRTY ONE A LOT ALLOWS LEGITIMATE HOME SHARING WHILE PRESERVING THE ROLE PREVENTING THE REMOVAL OF HOUSING FOR THE HOUSING STOCK. DUE TO FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS AND MANY HOTELS PROLIFERATING WITH ANY OF COUNTY COUNCILS ON AS A PRIMARY RESIDENCE ON SITE. THEY ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE BILL. IF THE CITY ZONES AREA RESIDENTIAL TOURISM THEY'RE EXCLUDED FROM THE BILL. IF THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE IS NOT ON SITE IN THE SHORT TERM VACATION WITH A PLATFORM MAY BOOK THAT UNIT FOR UP TO THIRTY DAYS. AND THAT IF THE IF THE USER DECIDES A PLATFORM HOP THAT'S NINETY DAYS TOTAL PER YEAR. THAT INCLUDES ALMOST EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND IN A YEAR OR THE ENTIRE SUMMER. THAT'S APPROPRIATE HOME SHARING THAT DOES NOT REMOVE HOUSING FROM THE HOUSING STOCK. AND AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE ALLOWS RETURN OF MUCH READ NEEDED TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THIS IS THE TAX THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS USED TO ACCOMMODATE THE SERVICES NEEDED FOR THEIR THEIR INTEREST POPULATION. AND THIS IS CRITICAL TO ALLOW -- THE IMPACT OF THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS ON THE COMMUNITIES TO BE RECOVERED BY CITIES AND ALSO A LOT OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO COMPARE WHO'S RENTING OUT WHO'S GOTTEN A PERMIT. AND COMPARE THAT BACK TO THEIR LOCAL PERMITTING PROCESS SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE DONE RIGHT NOW. I'D LIKE TO ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE MEMBERS TAKEN THIS COMMITTEE MEANS THIS IS A THREE YEAR PILOT INSTEAD OF THE PROPOSED FIVE YEAR PILOT -- AND WE WILL HAVE A MUCH NEED. A VERY IMPORTANT STUDY AT THE END -- SHOWING WHAT THE EFFECT OF THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS ARE ON THE HOUSING MARKET AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES COASTAL ZONE. SPECIFICALLY I'M INTERESTED IN TWO THINGS WHICH IS WHAT THE EFFECT ON LONG TERM RENTAL RATES WHAT'S THE BY FACT ON HOUSING AVAILABILITY. THESE ARE THINGS WE CAN'T KNOW BECAUSE THERE'S NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS. AND THE INDIVIDUAL PERMITTING THAT HAPPENS IN THE CITY. THIS BILL IS ALSO SIMPLE TO IMPLEMENT IT REQUIRES FIVE FORMS ADD PRACTICALLY FOR CHECK BOXES THAT WOULD CATEGORIES A UNIT IN THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY'S COASTAL ZONE. AS ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS BILL IS A ARE YOU THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE ARE YOU ON SITE OR OFFSITE ARE YOU A RENTER AND IF YOU ARE TO HAVE PERMISSION FROM THE LANDLORD TO RENT AS A SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL. RIGHT IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE BALL IF THOSE CONDITIONS ARE MET THEN IT SAYS THIRTY DAYS MAXIMUM BOOKING OVER THE PLATFORM. CITIES WILL RECEIVE THIS INFORMATION CITIES WILL RECEIVE THIS INFORMATION FROM THE TO YOUR TEAM BE ABLE TO ENFORCE FOR THEIR LOCAL POLICIES. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE PROTECTS PROPERTY RIGHTS BY APPROPRIATELY REGULATING SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS. RATHER THAN REGULATING PROPERTY OWNER SOIT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED TO GET NOTHING SOME FOR SOME FOLKS IN THE HEAD AROUND THAT -- THEY CAN STILL RENT YOU KNOW ANY OF THE PROPERTY OWNERS CAN STILL WRITE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS AS THEY DID BEFORE THE ADVENT OF THESE PLATFORMS -- AND THAT MEANS THE COMMISSION TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS THEY CAN PUT A SIGN FROM THEIR HOUSE THEY CAN HAVE THEIR OWN WEBSITE OF COURSE NOTHING STOPS. ANY OF THE OF THE PROPERTY OWNERS FROM RENTING LONG TERM. OR FOR NINE MONTHS WE HAVE LOTS OF STUDENTS WHO ARE HOUSING AND SECURE THERE'S LOTS OF FOLKS THAT WOULD RENTED OUT DURING THE THE THE SCHOOL YEAR AND THEN DURING THE SUMMER THEY COULD HAVE THAT IS THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL USE -- AND SO ON THE ISSUE OF PROPERTY RIGHTS I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT REGULATE THE USE OF RESIDENTIAL HOME FOR A SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL. THAT'S THE JOB OF THE CITY BUT ONLY RECORD REGULATES THE PLATFORM AND HOW LONG THE PLATFORM CAN BOOK IT. SO AS A POINT OF FACT USE OF A RESIDENTIAL HOME FOR A SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL. IS NOT A VESTED PROPERTY RIGHT IT'S A VISITORS SERVING USE GRANTED ONLY IF ALLOW BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT VIA PERMITTING REGISTRATION LICENSING IT'S NOT AUTOMATICALLY VESTED IN THE HOMEOWNER. AB SEVENTY LEARNING THIRTY ONE PRESERVE LOCAL CONTROL BY ADDING WHAT I SAID BEFORE THE RESIDENTIAL TOURISM PROVISION THAT'S BASED CAN OPT OUT PROVISION OF CITIES IF THEY WANTED TO THEY COULD. GO IN AND SAY. DO A RESIDENTIAL TOURISM OVERLAY AND THEN THEIR ENTIRE CITY COULD HAVE THAT IN THE COASTAL ZONE IF THEY WANTED. AND AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE ALSO PRESERVES COASTAL ACCESS. BEYOND THE LOW COST COAST ACCOMMODATION WHICH WERE ALREADY REALLY GOOD AT DOING. BY ALLOWING THE LEGITIMATE HOME SHARING WITH PRIMARY RESIDENCE ON SITE AND THEN OFF SITE FOR UP TO NINETY DAYS A YEAR -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE LOW TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL TO ADDRESS ONE PART OF THE EQUATION AND IT IS ONLY ONE PART. WE DO HAVE OTHER ISSUES IN THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY BECAUSE OF SOME OF THIS DOES ONE PART TO REALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HOUSING AFFORDABILITYAND THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY COASTAL ZONE AND WITH ME I'VE TO WITNESSES AND SO CHRIS DIPLOMA AND SERRA FOX. THANK YOU TWO MINUTES TEACHER IF YOU WOULD MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY BOMB ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. WILL DO IN ONE MINUTE OR LESS TWO POINTS A PUBLIC SAFETY THE SHORT TERM RENTALS CHANGE THE PROFILE OF A COMMUNITY AND THE SERVICE LEVEL DEMANDS ON THE COMMUNITY. A SO IT'S JUST A MATTER PUBLIC SAFETY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND TIED TO THAT AND SECONDARILY TO THAT. OF HAVING THIS INFORMATION SO THE PLATFORMS CAN. COLLECT AND REMIT THE PROPER TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAXES TO THE LOCALITIES THAT IS THE REVENUE THAT IS FUNDING THE SERVICES TO THESE. HOMES AND THEREFORE WE NEED TO BETTER HAVE ABILITY TO AUDIT AND COLLECT OF THIS. THIS REVENUE WE ARE YOUR SUPPORT. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE GOOD GOOD ADAM WHERE MEMBERS SERRA FLOCKS FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. WE REPRESENT MEMBERS WHO WORK AND LIVE IN THESE COASTAL ZONES AND TING THIS IS A VERY MODEST BILL -- AND IT THE REDS THE NEEDLE AND FINDS MIDDLE GROUND IT DOES PROTECT. PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR INCOME WHO NEED TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR INCOME BY RENTING OUT TO SPARE ROOMS ARE COTTAGES THEY CAN DO THAT THAT IT LEAVES THEM BE WHAT IT DOES. IS IT PREVENTS PRACTICES THE I WOULD SEE ABUSE OF THESE PLATFORMS THAT IS FUELING A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IT IS INVESTORS L. L. C.'S COMPANIES THAT ARE BUYING UP PROPERTIES IN THE COASTAL ZONE BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO VACATION THERE. AND THEN RENTING THEM OUT ON THESE PLATFORMS AND ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN ZONE WHEN AREAS THAT ARE ZONED RESIDENTIALLY THEY ARE RUNNING A LEGAL HOTELS. BUT WITHOUT WORKERS WITHOUT INSURANCE WITHOUT ANY OF THE LAWS THAT PREVENT THINGS LIKE HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHICH HOTELS HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD ABOUT -- BEING THE POSTING AND NOTICING WHO'S COMING IN AND OUT OF THESE HOTELS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT A JUST AN INFORMAL SURVEY OF AIRBNB IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY -- 50% OF THE HOSTS HAVE MULTIPLE PROPERTIES LISTED. WHICH MEANS THESE ARE PROBABLY COMPANIES THAT ARE BUYING UP PROPERTIES AND THEN RENTING THEM OUT IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP POSTS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY SOME OF THEM ARE BLUE WATER VACATIONS. PENNY REALTY THESE ARE NOT FAMILIES WHO JUST HAVE A SECOND HOMES THAT THEY'RE RENTING OUT. AND THIS IS AN IMPACT ON BUSINESS IT HAS AN IMPACT ON HOUSING IT HAS AN IMPACT ON THINGS LIKE RESTAURANTS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE COKING IN THEIR AIRBNB UNIT SO THERE ARE A LOT OF RIPPLE A FAX -- AND THERE'S EVEN THERE'S A RECENT STUDY THAT CAME OUT JUST RESPONDING TO THE ANALYSIS -- FROM UCLA AND A RESEARCHER AT USC. THAT. ACTUALLY SHOWS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE AN INCREASE IN AIRBNB RENTALS RENT DOES GO UP AND THAT THE FACTIS EXACERBATED WHEN YOU HAVE. THESE NON OWNER OCCUPIED RENTALS LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SAN DIEGO. SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE CARE MEMBERS MAP BROUGHT FOR THE TEAMSTERS AND UNITE HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MEMBERS JOHN CALDWELL CALIFORNIA HOTEL LODGING ASSOCIATION FOR IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU WITNESSES ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION COME ON DOWN. TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE THANKS. AND WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO HIT IT RIGHT ON TO AN ALL GO FIRST TO LET DATA SPEAK UP -- MY NAME'S JOHN ROSS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF AIRBNB I HAVE WITH ME DAY FLETCHER WHOSE AND AIRBNB HOST HE WILL READ A LETTER -- AT WHEN I CONCLUDE -- SUBMITTED ON BEHALF OF SHARE SAN DIEGO AND OVER SIX THOUSAND HOST STATEWIDE EXPRESSING THEIR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL -- FUNDAMENTALLY WE THINK THIS IS A HARD ISSUE AND A HEART ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE RESOLVED IN SAN DIEGO BY SAN DIEGANS -- THIS BILL HAS DIVIDED SAN DIEGO LEGISLATORS IS DIVIDED RESIDENTS OF THE COMMUNITY AND WE THINK THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR AN ISSUE SUCH AS THIS TO BE RESOLVED. ON THE BILL ITSELF I'D LIKE TO MAKE A HANDFUL OF POINTS BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO DAVE -- FIRST ADD THIS BILL BANS BANS -- THE RENTAL OF VACATION HOMES HI IN SAN DIEGO IF YOU'RE NOT A PRIMARY RESIDENCE IN A PRIMARY RESIDENT IS DEFINED AS ONE WHO. LIVES IN THE HOME. MORE DAYS IN A YEAR THAN THEY LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE. THE BILL DOES NOT LET YOU USE A HOSTING PLATFORM TO READ YOUR HOME. SO IF YOU HAVE A IF YOU LIVE IN LOS ANGELES AND YOU HAVE A HOME IN SAN DIEGO AND USE BRB OUR AIRBNB TO RENT THAT. GRAPHICALLY THIS BILL SAYS NOW. IT DOES SAY THAT A PRIMARY RESIDENT CAN DO IT IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES OF DAY ARE LIVING THERE PART TIME IF THEY LIVE THERE FULL TIME THEY HAVE MUCH MORE GENEROUS PROFESSIONS BUT FOR THOSE ONE WE CAN RUN A VACATION I'M IT SAYS NOW. HI IT PREEMPTS THE ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ESTABLISH THRESHOLD THAT THEY THINK ARE MORE APPROPRIATE THAN THE THRESHOLD SET FORTH IN THIS BILL. PAGE THREE LINE THIRTY SAID I'M ON PAGE THREE LINE THIRTY SIX THROUGH PAGE FOUR LINE NINE AND THEN PAGE FOUR LINES TEN THREE FIFTEEN WAY OUT THE CAPS. THAT APPLY TO RENTALS IN SAN DIEGO INTO THIS BILL AND THEY SAY THAT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT APPLY -- A CAP THAT'S GREATER THAN WHAT IS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS BILL SO IN THAT WAY IT DOES SAY. THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN EXERCISE AS OUR OWN DISCRETION WHY DOES THAT MATTER AIRBNB IS CURRENTLY COLLECTING THE TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX. IN EIGHTEEN COUNTIES FORTY THREE CITIES THREE CITIES WITHIN SAN DIEGO COUNTY AS THOSE IF THE BILL IS SUCCESSFUL IN THE INTENT IS TO RESTRICT. THE USE OF SHORT TERM RENTAL PLATFORMS IN THOSE AREAS WE ARE THE ONES REFLECT IN THE TIER TEAM PROVIDE IN ITS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. YOU'RE GONNA PUSH THESE TRANSACTIONS OFF THE PLATFORMS WERE WE CURRENTLY CORRECT COLLECT THE TOT PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND REDUCE THE REVENUE THAT'S ENJOYED CURRENTLY BY OCEANSIDE CARLSBAD IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. ON COASTAL ACCESS TO TO YOU KNOW HIT ON THE BIG POINT THAT I THINK -- I'D SEND YOU I'M SORRY SENATOR THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE CORRECTION AS USUAL. YOU'VE GOTTEN ABOUT TWO MINUTES AND FORTY SECONDS I'M MORE VERBOSE THAN I WANTED TO BETTER I TRY TO WRAP IT UP WILL GIVE YOU A SO ON ON COASTAL ACCESS AND I THINK THAT'S FOR THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STARTED. THE CAUSAL MISSION HAS A CHARGE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE AT THE COAST HAVE THE ABILITY TO VISIT THE COAST AND STAND ACCOMMODATIONS. AS COMMUNITIES ALONG THE COAST HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF SHORT TERM RENTALS THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS WEIGHED IN AND SAID NO IN MANY CASES THAT'S NOT REASONABLE IT'S OVERLY RESTRICTIVE. WE NEED TO TAILOR -- WE NEED TO TAILOR THE PARTICULAR PERMISSION THAT COMMUNITY IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS -- FOR SHORT TERM ACCESS TO CONTINUE TO THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH. AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND READ YOUR LETTER PLEASE THE THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU FOR PRESIDENT IF YOU COULD SPEAK INTO THE HIT GO GREAT ART SURE SAN DIEGO IS A COALITION OF SHORT TERM RENTAL OWNERS MANAGERS AND PROPERTY RIGHTS. ADVOCATES IN SAN DIEGO AS SUCH WE OPPOSE AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE DUE TO ITS DEVASTATING THE EFFECTS IT WILL HAVE. ON OUR REGION AND LOCAL ECONOMY FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS SAN DIEGO HAS DEPENDED ON SHORT TERM RENTALS. ARE REGION'S RICH HISTORY OF SUPPORTING THESE LOW COST VISITOR ACCOMMODATIONS MADE OUR COMMUNITY A VIBRANT PLACE THE ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S TOP TOURIST DESTINATIONS. UNFORTUNATELY AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE ATTEMPTS TO TURN BACK THE CLOCK AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR FAMILIES TO VISIT OUR BEACH COMMUNITIES BY. ESSENTIALLY BANNING ON HOSTED SHORT TERM RENTALS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OR CITY COUNCIL VOTED TO PUT INTO EFFECT A SIMILAR LAW WHICH WOULD HAVE ALSO RESTRICTED SHORT TERM RENTALS. IN A LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS SIXTY TWO THOUSAND REGISTERED VOTERS SIGNED PETITIONS TO STOP THIS LAW FROM GOING INTO EFFECT. A. B. SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WOULD. UNDERMINE AT THE WILL OF THE LOCAL VOTERS WHO HAVE ALREADY OPPOSE SUCH HEAVY HANDED RESTRICTIONS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN STUDY BY RESEARCHERS ECONOMIST ALAN NEVIN FOUNDED THAT IN SAN DIEGO ALONE SHORT TERM RENTAL STREET NEARLY. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND SUPPORT MORE THAN THIRTY ONE THOUSAND JOBS. THESE ARE JOBS THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE EXIST WITHOUT THOSE LOW COST A VISITOR ACCOMMODATIONS. ADDITIONALLY THE CITY COLLECTED MORE THAN TWENTY SIX MILLION IN TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAXES FROM THESE RENTALS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALONE. HELPING PAY FOR HOMELESS PROGRAMS POLICE FIRE AND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE LCAL ROADS WITH NO WITH SO MUCH AT STAKE FOR OUR REGION I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. VOTE NO ON AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE AND KEEP SAN DIEGO A WELCOMING PLACE FOR ALL VISITORS AND HELP PROTECT THIS VITAL PART OF OUR REGION'S. TOURIST INDUSTRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH BY TWO MINUTES ON THE BUT OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU'D STEP FOR WITH NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. A GOOD MORNING OF A JOURNAL I HOPE NOT. IT'S A BEEN A GOOD IT GOOD AFTERNOON ALMOST GOOD EVENING APOLOGIES -- CREAM GREASY AND A HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SIR. AND AT THE GONZALEZ ON BEHALF OF EXPEDIA IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. TWENTY LOOK BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CENTRAL COAST MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION -- WE OPPOSE FOR SMALL VACATION RENTAL MANAGERS WHO HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR DECADES THANK YOU. BUT SHEPHERD ON BEHALF OF THE CAL ASIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING BILL -- CENTER WHITE HOUSE KEY WILL START WITH YOU I'M SORRY MADAM CHAIR I WAS AT THE HOUSING AND I'M NOT SURE THE STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT SOME. A CONFUSING LANGUAGE ABOUT WHETHER IT IT'S THIRTY DAYS AT THE HOUSE THE PROPERTY CAN BE RENTED OR THIRTY DAYS AND IT'S ON THE THE THE HOST SITE HAVE THOSE WITH THOSE CLOTHES. IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE TWELVE ITEM EIGHT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT THE CLARIFY SAID AND ONE OF THE OTHER MA'AM AND ALSO -- MOVES THE SUNSET DATE TWO THREE YEARS RATHER THAN FIVE YEARS. AND THOSE HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED YES. AND I HAVE A QUESTION OF WHAT IS A RESIDENTIAL TOURISTS SOUND. IT'S A IT'S IS ON THAT WE TYPICALLY HAVE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY OCEANSIDE HASN'T. AND SO IT'S AN AREA THAT'S DESIGNED TO HAVE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS AND SO FOR EXAMPLE HALF OF THE OCEAN SIDE -- COASTAL ZONE IS IN THE RESIDENTIAL TOURISM DOWN AND SO THAT'S WHY WE CAME THE MAYOR OF OCEANS THAT ASK FOR THAT AMENDMENT AND WE TOOK OUT OF MY MEANT -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT AND THAT'S THE MECHANISM FOR THE OPT OUT PROVISION SO STATE CREATE A RESIDENT AND TOURISM SO IN A RESIDENTIAL TOURISM OVERLAY OVER THERE BECAUSE OF THEIR OPTED OUT OF THE BILL OKAY. THE GOOD THE OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR DORADO [inaudible] YES -- I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO THIS ISSUE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS -- PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING ISSUES IN LOS ANGELES -- AND THIS IS A BEEN A VERY VERY -- GOTTEN CONTENTIOUS AT TIMES BUT I THINK AS WE WE STEP BACK AND LOOK AT ALL OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE IMPACTING OUR HOUSING STOCK. JUST HOUSING AVAILABILITY THIS HAS TO BE. FACTUALLY SEEN AS A PART. OF OF THE CAUSE OF HOUSING SHORTAGE. NOT THE WHOLE NOT EVERYTHING BUT A PART OF AND WE CAN'T GO FROM ONE ROOM TALK ABOUT HOUSING -- STOCKY SHORTAGE AND TO THE EMERGENCY AND HUSING AVAILABILITY AND THEN TURN AROUND AND ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE TO TO HAPPEN SO I I BEEN. INVOLVED IN THE TOURISM INDUSTRY. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY OF THIS STATE TOURISM PROVIDES AND CREATES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS. ALL OF THE HOTELS THE MOTELS EVERYONE WHO HAS INVESTED IN CREATING THAT PART OF OUR TOURISM INDUSTRY KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS AND SO ON YOU KNOW TO SAY THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW GOING TO PROVIDE. LOW COST HOUSING -- FOR TOURIST IS NOT TRUE. NOT TRUE THERE IN FACT THEIR RENTED THAT MUCH HIGHER MUCH HIGHER RATES A BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING -- TO YOU KNOW -- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE COMING IN SO THIS IS NOT GOING TO ADDRESS. THE AVAILABILITY OF LOW COST HOUSING IN THE COASTAL AREA SO I THINK THIS IS A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT -- PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO SUPPORT AND I APPRECIATE THAT. YOU HAVE NARROWED IT DOWN AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE. I AT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DO BUT YOU NARROWED IT DOWN IN SUCH A WAY THAT IS EXTREMELY REASONABLE AND FAIR SELF. I THANK THE AUTHOR AGAIN. US SENATOR MONNING. YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS FOR THE COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THIS I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IT'S A HUGE ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT BUT IT'S A TOURISM DISTRICT. BUT WE HAVE DIFFERENT CITIES WITH DIFFERENT ORDINANCES WE HAVE COASTAL ZONE. WE HAVE SOME CITIES ALLOWING KNOW AIRBNB NO SHORT TERM RENTALS WE HAVE OTHERS TRYING TO REGULATE IT. THE FACT THAT THIS WOULD BE A PILOT PROGRAM I THINK IT COULD EDUCATE OTHERS OF US IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. THERE'S THERE'S NO EASY SOLUTION TO THIS WE DO KNOW IN MY DISTRICT. HOUSING THAT USED TO BE AVAILABLE TO WORK FORCE. FOR LEASE AGREEMENTS. IS NOW OFF THE MARKET AND IT'S BEING RENTED OUT AT HIGHER RATES FOR WEEKEND USE ARM. AND IT'S AFFECTING NEIGHBORHOODS BUT WE HAVE WORKFORCE NOW COMMUTING FROM FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THEIR JOBS BECAUSE WHERE THEY USED TO BE ABLE TO RENT. A THREE BEDROOM HOUSE IN BIG SUR ON A ONE YEAR LEASE. THAT'S NOW BEING RENTED ON WEEKENDS FOR AS MUCH AS THEY WERE PAYING PER MONTH. BUT THEY'RE DRIVING FROM WATSONVILLE SALINAS. LOS BANOS PEOPLE ARE COMMON OVER THE MOUNTAINS TO THEIR JOBS SO. LETTING IT GO UNREGULATED I DON'T THINK IS THE ANSWER -- ALL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY BUT I'LL BE WATCHING TO LEARN LESSONS -- THAT CAN HOPEFULLY INFORMANTS. IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] CENTER BORCHERS. IF IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK JUST LET ME KNOW BY RAISING HIM OR SOMETHING I'M MY MENTAL TELEPATHY SO OF SKILLS -- A FADING WITH AGE. BUT MINE AS WELL AND I THANK YOU HAPPY TO HAVE YOU -- AT THE PROCEED SORRY I WAS -- WAS THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND THERE BORDERS I'LL HAVE A CONVERSATION LATER ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE EACH OTHER'S -- QUESTIONS I SUPPOSE SO -- JUST A QUICK QUESTION -- ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP -- WAS INVESTMENT VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES -- IF THIS BILL PASSES AND AND THEN SOME SOME AND THEN ADDITIONAL CONCERN ON THE THE TERM OF THIS OF THE I GUESS THE STUDY YOUR PILOT PROGRAM YOU KNOW THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS THREE YEARS IN A LONG ENOUGH. TO GET YOU KNOW LEARN THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT -- BUT SOMEHOW FIVE YEARS WAS IT ENDED UP BEING TOO LONG -- THE TWO QUESTIONS -- ONE AT HOW DO YOU DRESS FOR THE INVESTORS ABOUT THESE HOMES FOR THIS AS AN INVESTMENT VALUE. AND TO A CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE LENGTH OF THE PILOT. YES I I THINK THREE HERE ARE THE SECOND QUESTION FIRST I THINK THREE YEARS IS ON THE THE SHORT END FIVE YEARS WAS ON THE HIGH END -- BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THERE WERE THERE WAS A SENTIMENT OF THREE YEARS IS SUFFICIENT I THINK WE CAN LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS. WITHIN THREE YEARS I THINK THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE IF YOU SEE THE TRANSITION SO IF YOU'RE TWO ONE THREE THAT WILL GIVE YOU ACTUAL DATA. AND THAT SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO DO REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO GO YOU KNOW -- ACCOUNT FOR OTHER FACTORS GOING ON THE MARKET BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE REALLY GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR IS WHAT'S THE EFFECT ON HOUSING AVAILABILITY WHAT EFFECTS ON LONG TERM RENTS. AND WE KNOW THIS IS ONE ASPECT TO IT. THE SECOND IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT VALUE I BELIEVE -- THE AIRBNB REPRESENTATIVE IN THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY ACTUALLY TESTIFIED THAT LONG TERM RENTAL -- AMOUNTS ARE ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN SHORT TERM RENTAL RATES BECAUSE YOU DON'T RENT OUT SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS THE ENTIRE YEAR. IF I'M IF I'M CORRECT JOHN CAN CORRECT ME IF I AM INCORRECT BUT AND THAT'S THE THING IS YOU CAN GET THAT AND I WOULD WANT TO ADDRESS WITHOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT WHEN FAMILIES LIVE THEIR FAMILIES LIVE IN A COMMUNITY. SO SO I MEAN IF THE METER ON WE HAVE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS YOU HAVE A TOURISM. ECONOMY. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE FAMILIES LIVING THERE YOU HAVE THE ENTIRE ECONOMY. THOSE FOLKS ARE GOING TO BIRTHDAY PARTIES THEY'RE GOING TO MUSIC LESSONS THEY'RE GOING TO YOUR SCHOOLS ARE INVESTING YOUR PDAS THEIR VESTING NEAR TOWN COUNCILS ARE INVESTING TIME. SO THERE'S A MONETARY AND NON MONETARY COMPONENT OF HAVING LONG TERM RENTALS -- THAT REALLY IN RICH CITIES AND IN MANY WAYS OTHER THAN JUST THE TOURISM INDUSTRY THAT'S ONE ASPECT AS YOU KNOW IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY -- THANK YOU AND AND I APPRECIATE -- YOU TAKING THE TIME TO COME -- ME WITH ME PERSONALLY ALLEN AS WE DISCUSSED. I AGREE WITH. A LOT OF YOUR CONCERNS A LOT OF YOUR CRITICISMS OF OTHER -- GOVERNMENT -- AGENCIES -- I JUST CAN'T GET THERE TODAY ON THIS BUT I I I THINK THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON THAT ARE IMPORTANT. TO OUR SHARED COMMUNITY. THANK YOU CAN CENTER CHRONIC YOU OUT THE TORRENT WILL NEXT UNLESS THERE WAS A ADDITIONALQUESTION DO. I THINK WHAT WAS GOING ON MANAGER -- APOLOGIZE FOR JUMPING THE AUTHOR DID MENTION THAT JOHN MAY HAVE A RESPONSE TO ONE OF THE COMMENTS AND SHE MADE I ACTUALLY AM INTERESTED TO HEAR THE RESPONSE. THROUGH THE CHAIR PLEASE MAKE YOU SURE OUR CHURCH JACKSON AYE THE COMMENT THAT WE MADE IN THE ACHE IN THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE WAS -- QUOTING FROM US -- BAY AREA COUNCIL STUDY OF THE MARKET IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S PRETTY MATURE MARKET FOR THESE SORTS OF THINGS. AND WHAT THAT STUDY POINTED OUT IS IF YOU'RE AN INVESTOR AND YOU'RE BUYING A PROPERTY. WHAT YOU DO TO MAXIMIZE YOUR RETURN IS TO RENT IT OUT YEAR ROUND BECAUSE THE BREAK EVEN POINT? TO DO IT ON A DAILY BASIS AS MUCH HIGHER THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT IT DEPENDS ON THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN JURISDICTIONS BUT IN PARTS OF SAN FRANCISCO. IT'S THREE HUNDRED DAYS TO BREAK EVEN IN THE MARINA IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS BASED ON WHAT. THEY LOOKED AT SO WE HAVE FOUND ANECDOTALLY THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY TAKING PROPERTIES AND TURNING THEM INTO EUROPEAN BEES IS GROSSLY OVERSTATED. AND WE'VE WORKED WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES FINAL TO WORK AGAIN SAID IT'S AGAINST OUR POLICY TO SEEK YOU KNOW THE FACTS -- HOTELS CREATED A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY WHERE THAT OCCURS WE'VE WORKED WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REMOVE THOSE FROM THE SITE SO THAT'S A A GOAL THAT WE SHARE WE DON'T THINK THIS BILL GETS ANYWHERE CLOSE TO ADDRESSING THAT. AS I MISSED WHEN YOU OPENED -- EARLIER -- WHO YOU'RE REPRESENTING? OKAY THANK YOU. I RISK MY RESPOND TO THAT PLEASE. SO SO I THINK THERE'S THERE'S AN ASPECT OF THAT BUT WE KNOW WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS THAT ARE FULL TIME. AND I'M I HAVE ALWAYS SAID IN EVERY SINGLE COMMITTEE I'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS IN EVERY SINGLE COMMITTEE I AM HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. THEY GET TO THAT PLACE BECAUSE I AUTHORED THIS BILL ME MYSELF IN MY LIVING ROOM BROUGHT IT OUT RIGHT. WHICH MAY AND GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT TO IT BUT I'M HAPPY TO WORK ALL I CARE ABOUT IS THE REMOVAL OF HOUSING FOR THE HOUSING MARKET SAN DIEGO COUNTY CLASSES ON THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS KENTUCKY.
