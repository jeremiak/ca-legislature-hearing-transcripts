OKAY I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET STARTED HERE. I MEAN. MR ACOSTA. LEMASTER ACOSTA. AT BIGELOW WELL YEAH. HARRY. NO NO. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EVERYONE'S PATIENCE. IT'S A BUSY TIME OF THE YEAR WHERE WE HAVE TO. GO IN AND OUT TO PROCESS OF OUR BILLS. WONDER WHAT A WELCOME MISTER COSTA. WHO IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THIS ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE AND AEROSPACE? WHICH. IS CONDUCTING THIS INFORMATION HEARING TODAY ON THE FUTURE OF TRAVEL ISSUES AND COMMERCIAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION. NOW. I THINK BOTH FOR MYSELF AND FOR. MR ACOSTA. ALL OF US REPRESENTING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR WE ARE SO. PROUD TO BE OF THE REPRESENT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH I LIKE TO CALL THE AEROSPACE CAPITOL OF THE WORLD. WE CONTINUE TO LEAD THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND. INNOVATION ESPECIALLY IN THIS. IT WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE MODERN SPACE RACE. COMPANIES LIKE A SPACE ACTS VERSION ORBIT VIRGIN GALACTIC AND MANY OTHERS. ARE LEADING THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. AND. THIS EXCITING NEW AREA OF THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY WHICH CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S BIGGEST. INDUSTRIES IN FACT. AS CHAIR OF THE. OPAL I WE EVEN GOT MUSIC TO ADD THE EXCITEMENT HERE. AS CHAIR THEY AEROSPACE COMMITTEE I LIKE TO US SITE THE EIGHTY CURRENTLY STUDY. FROM A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW. AEROSPACE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT THE. THE GROSS REVENUES IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. IS EQUIVALENT OR EXCEEDS THAT OF THE. CALIFORNIA'S AND ENTERTAINMENT AND. AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES COMBINED SO. AND AND THIS DE THE SPACE THE MARS SPACE RACE IS ADDING TO THAT. THAT SEX APPEAL OF THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY IN IS MAKING THE AEROSPACE. A COOL SO I WANT TO WELCOME EVERYONE. TO THIS. INFORMATIONAL HEARING WE HAVE A GREAT LINE UP OF OF SPEAKERS TO SHARE. HOPEFULLY WILL HAVE A. MEMBERS COMING IN. AS WE PROCEED BUT. WANTED A TURN OVER TO MISTER COSTA. INDUCER GASES WELL AS TO ANY OPENING COMMENTS YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP WITH. HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST THIS JOB SHADOWING ME TODAY FROM ONE OF OUR FOSTER. PROGRAMS IN THIS IS THE LEAN THAT BAD ASSN SHE'S GOING TO BE WITH ME ALL DAY LEARNING WHAT ITS LIKE TO RUN AROUND THE CAPITAL. IN AND EXPERIENCE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. WHAT WE DO HERE SHE'S FROM THE POMMEL A CALIFORNIA THE CENTRAL CENTRAL COAST AREA AND WANTS TO BE A HISTORY TEACHER? PERHAPS WHEN SHE AND WHEN SHE GRADUATES NEXT YEAR AND GO ON TO COLLEGE SHE ALREADY SELECTED SAC STATE SO SHE'S GONNA BE IN. TO GET TO KNOW OUR LOOK A RIVER REMEMBER HER FACE BECAUSE SHE'S GONNA BE IN THE CAPITAL AREA. GOING TO SACK STATE AND WE WELCOME YOU TO THIS SIDE. OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AYE JULIA AN HONOR AND A PLEASURE TO SERVE HERE ON. I. YOU KNOW REPRESENT THE SANTA CLARITA VALLEY SIMI VALLEY IS IN A NORTH SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHERE WE HAVE VERY HIGH CONCENTRATION I THINK WE SAY THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF. A DEFENSE AND AEROSPACE SUBCONTRACTORS. BUT IN ANY EVENT YEAH IT'S A VERY LARGE CONCENTRATION AND OF COURSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING AREA OTHER AREAS INCLUDING THE ANTELOPE VALLEY IN DOWN IN THE SOUTH BAY WHERE MISTER MY TO ACHIEVE REPRESENTS. AND IT REALLY. TOGETHER DOING A CREDIBLE JOB WITH THAT THIS INDUSTRY AND IT'S REALLY AN EXCITING THING HAVING BEEN AND BEEN TO THEIR THAT SPACE PORTS AND OF COURSE BEEN TO. LAUNCHES IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. THAT'S REALLY TRUE AN HONOR TO BE HERE SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A PRESENTATION TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF STRUCTURE ALRIGHT THANK YOU. AND I WELCOME THEM IS THAT AS. HOPE THIS INSPIRES YOU NOT ONLY BE BECOME A TEACHER BUT PERHAPS A SOMEDAY. CONSIDER RUNNING FOR OFFICE AND SERVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INVITE OUR FIRST PANEL. SPACE TRAVEL ON SERVICES IN EMERGENCY AND INDUSTRIES I'D LIKE TO WELCOME TO THE TABLE AND I THINK. WELL I GUESS WE CAN NO ONE WANTED TIME. EVA AROUND A SENIOR MANAGER OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR SPACEX. THINK YOU'RE GONNA START WITH A VIDEO CAMERA. THAT YOUR MUSIC TOO YEAH I THINK IT'S A MATCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENTS IN COMMERCIAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION. TAKING PLACE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA IS TRULY LEADING THE WORLD IN INNOVATION FOR COMMERCIAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION AND I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE REPRESENTING MY MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND SPACE ACTS COLLEAGUES WERE WORKING TIRELESSLY TO REVOLUTION EIGHT SPACE TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE IN A DYNAMIC AND EXCITING TIME FOR COMMERCIAL SPACE INDUSTRY. SPACEX IT'S PROUD TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS INNOVATION WHETHER IT'S REUSABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE SYSTEMS THE TRANSPORTATION OF ASTRONAUTS USING OUR CREW DRAGON SPACECRAFT OR SUPPORTING THE AIRFORCE IN RELIABLE AFFORDABLE LAUNCH SERVICES FOR CRITICAL NATIONAL ASSETS. FROM THE BEGINNING SPACEX HAS LEVERAGED AMERICAN AND MORE SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIAN INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE THE MOST ADVANCED SPACE LAUNCH VEHICLES AND SPACECRAFT IN HISTORY. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS DEEPLY INTERWOVEN AND THE STORY AND CONTINUES TO BE WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND EMPLOYEES ARE BASED. SPACEX HAS GROWN REMARKABLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TO WHERE WE STARTED WITH JUST THREE EMPLOYEES IN A GARAGE IN EL SEGUNDO. INDIA SEEN FIRST HAND OUR EXTENSIVE OPERATIONS IN HAWTHORNE CALIFORNIA. TODAY WE ARE PROUD TO PROVIDE A DEPENDABLE AND AFFORDABLE RIDE TO SPACE FOR NASA. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS AND THE WORLD'S MOST SOPHISTICATED COMMERCIAL SATELLITE OPERATORS. WE REGULARLY CONDUCT I'M CRUDES RESUPPLY MISSIONS TO AND FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. WITH OUR DRAGON SPACECRAFT LAUGHS LATER THIS YEAR SPACEX WILL BEGIN LAUNCHING AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS ON AMERICAN ROCKETS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE SPACE SHUTTLE WAS RETIRED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. COMMERCIALLY SPACEX HAS RESTORED THE UNITED STATES AS THE LEADER IN GLOBAL SATELLITE LAUNCH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES. SPACEX IS NOW THE LEADING PROVIDER OF COMMERCIAL SATELLITE LAUNCH GLOBALLY OVERTAKING THE FRENCH AND THE RUSSIANS IN MARKET SHARE THIS YEAR WE WILL LAUNCH THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD'S COMMERCIAL SATELLITES. THIS MEANS CALIFORNIA JOBS AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THREE THROUGHOUT SPACEX'S PATH FROM OUR UPSTART BEGINNINGS IN EL SEGUNDO CALIFORNIA HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE. OUR HAWTHORNE HEADQUARTERS CONVERTED FROM AN ABANDONED IN BLIGHTED AEROSPACE SICILY TO STATE OF THE ART ROCK AND SPACECRAFT FACTORY. REMAINS WERE WE UNDERTAKE ESSENTIAL COMPANY OPERATIONS SUCH AS DESIGN ENGINEERING PRODUCTION AND MISSION CONTROL. BEYOND HAWTHORNE SPACEX HAS ESTABLISHED A NETWORK OF SUPPLIERS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE HIGHEST QUALITY MATERIALS AND PARTS. WE WORK WITH OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED CALIFORNIA SUPPLIERS RANGING FROM SMALL BUSINESSES TO LARGE COMPANIES AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN WE I SPENT OVER TWO BILLION. WITH THESE CALIFORNIA SUPPLIERS TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. SPACEX NOT ONLY DESIGNS AND BUILDS THE WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED ROCKETS AND SPACECRAFT IN CALIFORNIA WE ALSO LAUNCH THEM HERE. SPACEX MAINTAINS A WEST COAST LAUNCH AND LANDING SITE AS WELL AS A PAYLOAD INTEGRATION FACILITY AT SPACE LAUNCH COMPLEX FOR LOCATED IN VANDENBERG AIRFORCE BASE. THIS COMPLEX SERVES AS A CRUCIAL LAUNCH PLATFORM FOR COMMERCIAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY PAYLOADS. WE REINTRODUCED COMMERCIAL LAUNCH FROM VANDENBERG AND TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND HAD SINCE LAUNCH MULTIPLE COMMERCIAL SATELLITES FROM VANDENBERG. THE ONLY COMPANY CURRENTLY DOING SO. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SPACEX HAS ALSO CALLED THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES HOME TO ITS RECOVERY EFFORTS FOR BOTH THE DRAGON AND FALCON NINE. AND SPACEX JUST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED TO. THAT IT PLANS TO EXPAND THE OPERATION TO INCLUDE PRODUCTION DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NEXT GENERATION ROCK AND SPACECRAFT. OVERALL SPACEX'S CALIFORNIA FACILITIES IMPACT OVER TWENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA JOBS AND OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS SPACEX PRODUCTION. LAUNCH AN ADMINISTRATIVE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA EXCEEDED SEVEN BILLION ECONOMIC IMPACT MAJORITY WHICH WAS REMAIN HAS BEEN RETAINED IN THE GREATER CALIFORNIA MARKET. MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE YOUR INVITATION TO TESTIFY TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA AEROSPACE INDUSTRY I LOOK FORWARD TO QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IBM. I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS. WELL ASK. NOW WHAT WHEN WE GO WITH EACH SPEAKER I WENT TIME BUT I WANTED TO. WELCOME THEM MISTER LACKEY TO. THE COMMITTEE I KNOW THAT MR LACKEY ALSO REPRESENTS. MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. AREAS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY MISTER LACKEY WHICH I LIKE TO. SEE ANY OPENING REMARKS THAT WE TO COME TO LISTEN TO ME I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL BEING HERE. THIS INDUSTRY REALLY DESERVES ARE OUR GREATEST SUPPORT. BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU BRING THE ENTIRE WORLD BENEFITS FROM THIS SIDE OF THIS INDUSTRY AND. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THAT TECH CALIFORNIA ALSO REAPS A GREAT DEAL OF BENEFIT FROM YOUR. SO WITH. THAT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. RIGHT. SO. I'M IS BEREND IT AND I'M PRONOUNCING GOOD YEAH YEAH RIGHT OKAY. WELL YOU KNOW WE ALL CALIFORNIANS WERE VERY PROUD THAT. THAT SPACE ACTS. HAS THEY'RE GROWN FROM AS YOU INDICATED THREE EMPLOYEES IN EL SEGUNDO IN TWO THOUSAND TWO TWO NOW OVER SIX THOUSAND. WITH THE OVERALL IMPACT OVER TWENTY THOUSAND. JOBS. DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY CREATED. ARM. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE. THE HANDOUTS THAT WE PROVIDED TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS IS A A JOINT STUDY PUT OUT BY THE LA ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND THE SAN DIEGO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. AND. THEY TALK ABOUT. ONE OF THE. THE CENTRAL CHALLENGES OF. ESPECIALLY OF POLICYMAKERS. HERE IN OUR STATE CAPITOL. IS TO ENSURE THAT THE FUTURE. YOU NO OF OUR AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. DEPENDING ON THE ABILITY. OF. POLICY MAKERS AS WELL AS THE OVERALL ECOSYSTEM OF THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. TO BUILD THE EXISTING ECOSYSTEM A TO ATTRACT THE NEXT GENERATION AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY FIRMS SO. YEAH I WANT TO START OFF BY ASKING YOU IN THE WHAT. WHAT WHY DID WHY DID CALIFORNIA WHITE IS SPACEX? STARRED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WISE IS STILL IN CAL. WELL THERE THERE'S MANY REASONS AND THERE'S A VERY RICH AEROSPACE HISTORY HERE. THE BUILDING THAT WE'RE IN NOW WAS AN EXISTING AEROSPACE BUILDING THAT WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AND THEN CREATE THIS ADVANCED ROCKET. FACTORY I'M IN HAWTHORNE. AYE THERE'S ALSO DEEP SUPPLIER NETWORK I BELIEVE AS I REMEMBER ACOSTA AT REFERENCE THAT IS OPENING REMARKS AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND REALLY YOU KNOW WORK WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY FOR THAT. IN THERE'S GREAT EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS HERE AND PEOPLE WHO I KNOW BRING A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE WITH THEM. AND YOU KNOW. IT ISN'T IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU KNOW TECHNICALLY SKILLED WORKERS AT WE DO MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCTION IN OUR FACILITY. I'M AND SO WORKERS FROM ALL DIFFERENT LEVELS WITH THE INSTITUTIONS THAT AROUND THERE WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS CALIFORNIA IS A GREAT PLACE FOR US TO BUILD AND GROW. OKAY. SO. WORK FOR SUPPLY SYSTEM EDUCATION RESEARCH. THOSE ARE. THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD NOT ONLY FROM SPACE EXPENDABLE SO FROM MANY. AEROSPACE COMPANIES THE REASON WHY. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LEAD AND AEROSPACE INNOVATION. WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES OF? OF OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. SURE SO I THINK WHAT WE FIND IS% WERE ALWAYS OUT WORKING TO WITH THE LOCAL ECONOMY TO ENSURE THAT WERE RECRUITING AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. ENSURING THAT WE CAN KEEP UP WITH THE PRODUCTION MEANS WE FOUND HERE AND IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. WE'VE RAMPED UP OUR NEED TO LAUNCH AND A MUCH MORE FREQUENT PACE AND SO WE'VE BEEN REALLY I AM FORTUNATE IN THAT RESPECT BUT ALSO RENTING UP TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HERE ARE. YOU KNOW BEING PROMOTED IN STEM EDUCATION THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT STEM EDUCATION LOCALLY SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PRODUCE. IT PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE INDUSTRY AND THAT ARE SKILLED FOR THE INDUSTRY AS WELL. WHAT ABOUT? YOU KNOW OFTEN WE WE HEAR. THAT. CALIFORNIA CAN BE A DIFFICULT PLACE TO DO BUSINESS WHAT IT'S BEEN SPACEX'S EXPERIENCE SO AND YOU KNOW I THINK AGAIN CONTINUING TO THE PORT. CATIONS ONE OF OUR BIG PRIORITIES BUT ALSO AS STABILITY IN POLICY SO I WANTED TO PERSONALLY THANK YOU FOR IN TWENTY FOURTEEN INTRODUCING AB SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN WHICH I AM. ENSURE THAT WE HAD SOME STABLE TAX POLICY WHEN IT CAME TO SPACE LAUNCH AND. ALSO AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY FOR YOUR SUPPORT WITH AB THIRTY ONE NINETY SEVEN TO CONTINUE THAT POLICY SO YOU KNOW CONTINUING POLICIES LIKE THAT LOOKING AT STABILITY THAT'S YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE SUPPORT EFFORT ALSO. CONTINUING TO SUPPORT STEM EDUCATION AT ALL LEVELS WHETHER ITS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JUNIOR HIGH COLLEGE AND KEEPING THAT IN THE FOREFRONT OF EDUCATION. ALRIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. JUST THE EP TOUCHED ON IT BRIEFLY. OBVIOUSLY WE HELP WE UNDERSTAND THE THE NEED FOR THE THE HIGHER LEVEL EDUCATION WE GOT GREAT INSTITUTIONS SEEM LIKE. YOU KNOW CAL TECH OR UC SYSTEM ARE CSU SYSTEM THAT IT'S GOOD FEEDER. WHAT ABOUT SOME OF THE? I'LL ENTRY LEVEL IF YOU WILL JOBS I'M SURE YOU NEED A LOT OF. SKILLED LABOR PEOPLE THAT KNOW HOW TO. YOU KNOW WELL THAN MEN AND BUILD THINGS WHAT WHAT KIND OF TALK A BIT ABOUT THAT PROCESS AND WHAT WILL COME OF EMPLOYER LOOKING FOR THEIR HOW WE CAN HELP WITH THAT. YES SO WE WORK A LOT WITH THE LOCAL ECONOMY WE HIRE LOCALLY AND SPECIFICALLY WITH OUR AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAD THOSE ARE THE PLACES WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH AND TO GET MORE OF THE. TECHNICIANS GET THEM INTO THE FACTORIES ARE DOING THOSE. KINDS OF WORK THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN FACT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALONE. TRADE HOWEVER HUNDRED EMPLOYEES FROM LOCAL CONNED COLLEGES THROUGH AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM TO GET THEM. THE THE SKILLS THEY NEED BUT THE OTHER THING IS ALSO YOU KNOW PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES ALSO HAVE THE SKILLS THAT WE CAN ALSO TRANSLATE THAT. AS WELL. SO THE LOCAL ECONOMY IS HELPING US WITH THAT. YOU KNOW WE OF JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THAT NOW. YEAH WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT TO. A SKILLS GAP IN CALIFORNIA THAT. THAT WHILE THE JOBS EXIST WE IT AT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH OF THE SKILLED WORKERS. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF STEM BUT. AS A I THINK MR ACOSTA HAS A PARTICULAR PASSION FOR. ARCURI TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE. IS SPACEX ARE ARE WE GETTING OUR ARE WE A EDUCATING AND TRAINING ENOUGH FOR SHEET METAL WORKERS AND WELDERS. YES THERE IS THERE IS DEFINITELY A NEED FOR THAT AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND OTHER TECHNICAL COLLEGES COLLEGES TO KIND OF TAP INTO THAT BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. CURRENT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. ALRIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME SHEDDING. ALL RIGHT NEXT TO LIKE TO WELCOME WELL POMERANTZ THE VICE PRESIDENT OF SPECIAL PROJECTS FOR VIRGIN ORBIT. FANTASTIC WELL GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN. ASSEMBLYMAN LACKEY SOMEONE ACOSTA THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT NOT ONLY FOR DOING US THE HONOR OF GIVING US THE INVITATION TO COME UP AND SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY BUT FOR YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP. AS A CALIFORNIA AND AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A LIFELONG DIE HARD ENTHUSIAST FOR EVERYTHING AEROSPACE I'M HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY DEAD TO WORK. THROUGH THAT I LOVE IN A STATE WHERE WERE SURROUNDED BY SO MANY INSPIRING COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENT FACILITIES. IS REALLY INCREDIBLE TO ME AND AND KNOW THAT COULD HAPPEN WITHOUT LEADERSHIP AT THAT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND AT THE STATE LEVEL SO I AM TRULY APPRECIATIVE THAT. YOU MAY JUST A MOMENT HERE I WILL. THERE THERE'S THE MOUSE I'LL CALL UP A QUICK PRESENTATION I WANTED TO JUST GIVE YOU A QUICK OVERVIEW AS WELL AS A STATUS UPDATE ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE VARIOUS COMPANIES THAT ARE WITH IN THE. THE VIRGIN SPACE PORTFOLIO AS IT WERE I SHOULD BE SPEAKING TODAY ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT COMPANIES. THAT ALL HAVE A FEW THINGS IN COMMON AYE ONE IS A GENERAL PURPOSE WHICH IS ALL ABOUT DEMOCRATIZING ACCESS SPACE ARE ALLOWING NOT NOT ONLY PIONEERING AGENCIES LIKE NASA AND UNITED STATES AIRFORCE THAT HAVE EXPORTS SPACE SO WELL FOR SO LONG. NOT ONLY ALLOWING THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO MORE ON THE SAME BUDGET OR EVEN WITH GLASS. BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT I KNEW START UPS LIKE YOU HEAR UP. FROM MIGHT FRONT FROM MY FRIEND CALLING MISTER CASEY IN JUST A MOMENT I UNIVERSITIES LIKE THE GREAT CAL STATE UNIVERSITIES. TO TO HAVE THEM BE ABLE TO EXPLORE SPACE MORE AND MORE OFTEN AS WELL THE OTHER THING WE HAVE IN COMMON OF COURSE IS OUR FOUNDER. SIR RICHARD BRANSON AYE SIR RICHARD IS THAT IS THAT IS A UNIQUE INDIVIDUAL HE IS NOT AN ENGINEER I OR A PHYSICIST. HE IS THAT HE'S A BUSINESS PERSON HE'S A SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY ABOUT SIXTY COMPANIES IN THE WORLD WITH VIRGIN IN THE NAME AND THEY RANGE EVERYTHING FROM. BANKS TO RAIL LINE'S TO CRUISE SHIPS TO HOTELS TO RADIO STATIONS TO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN THINK OF I'M RICHARD AT RICHARD HAS TRIED IT. NOT RICHARD I GREW UP WATCHING THE EARLY EXPLOITS OF THE NASA ASTRONAUTS WATCHING YOU KNOW NEIL AND BUZZ HOP AROUND ON THE SURFACE OF THE MOON AND THAT WANT TO DO THAT WHEN HE WHEN HE GREW UP. AND THE INDUSTRY HAS NOT INVOLVED IN A WAY SUCH THAT HE'S ABLE TO BUY A TICKET TAKE TO GO TO SPACE HIMSELF SO. HE HAD THAT KIND OF CLASSIC ENTREPRENEURS REACTION OF SAYING WELL HERE'S THE THING I WOULD REALLY LIKE THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO PAY FOR THAT NO ONE SELLING SO I SHOULD PROBABLY START SELLING THAT. AND THAT WAS THE DAWN OF OF OF RICHARD'S AND INVOLVEMENT IN THE AIRSPACE COMMUNITY STARTING WITH VIRGIN GALACTIC NOW THERE ARE A TOTAL OF AT THREE DIFFERENT COMPANIES. VIRGIN GALACTIC AND THE SPACESHIP COMPANY AT WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER ON HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT SUMMIT TALK ABOUT THOSE FIRST AND I WILL SORT OF REFER TO THEM AS A. ONE COLLECTIVE ORGANIZATION ALTHOUGH TECHNICALLY. THEY THEY ARE SEPARATE VERGE TACTIC BEING MORE EQUIVALENT TO AN AIRLINE AND THIS BISHOP COMPANY BE MORE EQUIPMENT TO THE AIRFRAME MANUFACTURER LIKE THE BOEING OR THE AIRBUS EQUIVALENT. I WORKED AT VIRGIN GALACTIC FOR OUT FOR SIX YEARS. AND MY MAIN JOB WAS TO START THE OTHER ONE VIRGIN ORBIT THE SATELLITE LAUNCH BUSINESS ALL JUST QUICKLY WALK YOU THROUGH EACH OF THE TWO OF THOSE. I'M SO VIRGIN GALACTIC IN THE SPACESHIP COMPANY TOGETHER COLLABORATE NAM ON BUILDING TESTING FLYING AND SOON PUTTING INTO COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS. THIS VEHICLE IT'S ACTUALLY PART OF A VEHICLE SET WHICH IS A FULLY REUSABLE SUB ORBITAL HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT SYSTEM DESIGNED TO CARRY AYE EITHER ASTRONAUTS. OR SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS OR A COMBINATION OF THE TWO AT INTO SPACE ON VERY ROUTINE VERY SAFE AND VERY AFFORDABLE FLIGHTS. AND IT IS A AYE SOMEWHAT UNIQUE LOOKING VEHICLE CERTAINLY AYE IF YOU'RE USED TO ROCKETS IF YOU'VE BEEN OUT OF VANDENBERG TO WATCH FLIGHTS. WHEN YOU CAN SEE THEM THROUGH THE FOG AT LEAST TELL YOU'RE PROBABLY USED A ROCKET STANDING ON THEIR TAILS AND LAUNCHING FROM LAUNCH PADS ON THE GROUND. AT THE VIRGIN GROUP OF COMPANIES WE DO THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY. WE START WITH ROCKETS THAT ARE STRAPPED UNDERNEATH THE WINGS OF AIRPLANES MUCH LIKE CHUCK YEAGER IN THE BELL X. ONE OR THE X. FIFTEEN PROGRAM A LOT OF THE GREAT LUMINARIES OF AEROSPACE. AT WHICH OF COURSE FLEW RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NOT SO THE SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY THAT VIRGIN OR VIRGIN GALACTIC AND. AND THE SPACESHIP COMPANY USE. INVOLVES A CUSTOM BUILT CARRIER AIRCRAFT CALLED THE WHITE KNIGHTS TO WHICH IS A DUAL FUSELAGE AIRCRAFT I ALWAYS SORT OF JOKINGLY REFER TO IT AS A CATAMARAN. AND THEN IN THE CENTER THERE THE MORE TRIANGULAR SHAPED. DEVICE THAT YOU SEE IS AT A SPACESHIP TO ARE FULLY REUSABLE SUBORBITAL SPACECRAFT. I TO WALK YOU THROUGH VERY BRIEFLY THE AT THE FLIGHT PROFILE AND THERE'S LOTS OF WONDERFUL VIDEOS ONLINE THAT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO WATCH BY THAT. BUT ONCE HE'S MY LIMITED TIME HERE JUST TO TALK YOU THROUGH THE LATEST UPDATES BUT BUT JUST QUICKLY SUMMARIZE WHAT WE DO IS WE ATTACH THE SPACESHIP TO THE WING OF THE CARRIER AIRCRAFT IT TAKES OFF. LIKE A NORMAL AIRPLANE. FROM A RELATIVELY NORMAL RUNWAY AT A WONDERFUL FACILITY IN MOJAVE THAT YOU'LL BE HEARING ABOUT IN THE FOLLOWING PANEL. DECLINES UP TO AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND FEET. AFTER WHICH THE ROCKET IS IT SAFE REALLY RACED RELEASED FROM THE WING OF THE AIRPLANE IT FREE FALLS AWAY FROM THE AIRPLANE FOR A FEW SECONDS TO GET GOOD SEPARATION BETWEEN THE TWO BEFORE IGNITING ITS HYBRID ROCKET MOTOR. THAT TAKES YOU ON A SUPERSONIC ROCKET POWERED ABSENT ON YOUR BILL PASSES BE TO SOUND ABOUT TEN SECONDS INTO THE FLIGHT. AND CONCILIATE CONTAIN ACCELERATING UP TO ABOUT THREE AND A HALF TIMES THE SPEED OF SOUND. AND WILL CARRY TWO PILOTS AND AS MANY AS SIX ASTRONAUTS IN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE UP ABOVE NASA'S OFFICIALLY ACCEPTED BOUNDARY OF SPACE. GIVING THEM A FEW MINUTES OF TIME IN WEIGHTLESSNESS TO FLOAT AROUND WHETHER THEY'RE THERE PURELY FOR FUN WHETHER THEY'RE THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE TEACHERS IN THERE DOING EXPERIMENT TO INSPIRE OTHER STUDENTS. ARE WHETHER THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE PROFESSIONAL RESEARCHERS WHO WORK FOR NASA LABS OR WORK FOR UNIVERSITIES OR WORK FOR PRIVATE COMPANIES LIKE SOME OF THE ONES YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT LATER TODAY. IT IS UP PRIMARILY THOUGHT OF AS A SPUR SPACE TOURISM PROGRAM. AND SPACE TOURISM IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT VIRGIN GALACTIC DIES SPACE TOURIST ALSO HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF THEY CONTROL THEIR OWN BUDGET AND THEY CAN BUY A TICKET ON THE VEHICLE THAT'S NOT YET BUILT IF THEY'RE EXCITED ENOUGH ABOUT IT. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M PERSONALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT BECAUSE MY EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND IS IN THE SPACE SCIENCES. IS THE ABILITY TO USE THE SAME VEHICLE WITH THE SAME PILOTS FLYING THE SAME FIGHT TRAJECTORY AS A RESEARCH VESSEL. ASA VIRGIN GALACTIC IN THE SPACESHIP COMPANY OVER THE COURSE OF ABOUT AN HOUR CAN RECONFIGURE THE CABIN OF THE VEHICLE BASICALLY PULLING OUT SOME SEATS PUTTING IN SOME RACKS. AND HAVING A SYSTEM WHEREBY EXPERIMENTS AGAIN THAT COULD BE BUILT BY STUDENTS ARE COULD BE BUILT BY NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS ARE ANYONE IN BETWEEN. CAN'T CAN FLY THEIR EXPERIMENTS TO SPACE I TYPICALLY THEY BE FINE THINGS EXPERIMENTS THAT ARE EACH ABOUT THE SIZE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MAYBE A MICROWAVE OVEN OR A DORM ROOM REFRIGERATOR. AND THEY CAN SOMETIMES YOU CAN STACK A FEW THOSE TOGETHER IF YOU NEED A BIGGER EXPERIMENT BUT IT'S ROUGHLY ROUGHLY IN THAT CLASS. I'M THESE VEHICLES ARE BILLS THIS IS REALITY AND THEIR NOT YET IN COMMERCIAL SERVICE BECAUSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S IMPORTANT TO. TEST AND TEST AND KEEP TESTING THESE AYE WE DO WANT TO FLY. CIVILIANS ON THESE VEHICLES INCLUDING OUR BOSS RICHARD BRANSON WANTS TO BE CUSTOMER NUMBER ONE HOW WOULD YOU CAN IMAGINE PUT SOME PRESSURE ON THE ON THE ENGINEERS THE OPERATING WORKFORCE TO ENSURE NOT ONLY THAT HE'S GONNA COME HOME SAFELY BUT THAT HE'S GONNA COME HOME SMILING. AND EXCITED ABOUT WHAT WE'RE ALL DOING. SO AS I MENTIONED THE VEHICLE SYSTEM INVOLVES TWO VEHICLES THAT CATAMARAN LIKE CARRIER AIRCRAFT WHICH WE CALL THE WHITE KNIGHT TO. AS OF TODAY THAT HAS FLOWN SAFELY TWO HUNDRED FORTY SIX TIMES IT HAS CREWMEMBERS ONBOARD IN EVERY SINGLE FLIGHT THERE ARE NO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES HERE THERE'S THESE ARE NOT DRONES THESE ARE ALL. HUMAN PILOTED SYSTEMS I SO THAT'S FOR THE CARRIER AIRCRAFT. THE SPACESHIP ITSELF HAS THAT HAS RECENTLY COMPLETED IT'S TWELFTH FIGHT INCLUDING ITS FIRST SUPERSONIC ROCKET POWERED FLIGHT WHICH IS A REALLY MAJOR MILESTONE. FOR THE PROGRAM AYE IT DID GO. ABOUT MACH ONE POINT EIGHT IF I'M RECALLING CORRECTLY ON THAT PARTICULAR FLIGHT. WE HOPE TO EVENTUALLY BURN THE ENGINE FOR FAR LONGER AS WE GET COMFORTABLE DOING SO. IT ALL. IT'LL EVENTUALLY TAKE THE VEHICLE AS A SET UP TO MACH THREE POINT FIVE OR SO AND SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF ROOM TO GO BY THATBUT OBVIOUSLY AS. AS CALIFORNIANS KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE THAT THAT BARRIER WHEN YOU CROSS THROUGH THE AT WITH THROUGH THIS THROUGH THE SOUND BARRIER IS AT SOME OF THE TRICKIEST THINGS IN AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DO THAT. I OUT WE ARE JUST BUILDING A SPACE SHIP WERE BUILDING A SPACE LINE IN A SPACE SHIP FACTORY. AND SO HERE IS A RELATIVELY RECENT CLAIMS FROM THE FROM THE AYE SHOP FOR. THANKS TO THAT THE INVESTMENT WE RECEIVED IN PARTICULAR THANKS TO THE TALENT OF OUR WORKFORCE WE HAVE BEEN A BEGUN ASSEMBLY ON THE NEXT TO SPACESHIPS. I BELIEVE THAT. ASSEMBLYMAN LACKEY IN AND I THINK ASSEMBLYMAN ACOSTA YOU HAD A CHANCE TO COME UP AND VISIT US WEEKLY FOR WHICH WERE VERY GRATEFUL AND YOU GOT A CHANCE TO SEE THE NEXT TWO SPACESHIPS WHICH WE LOVE MICHAEL AT A AND R. D. AFTER OUT TO RICHARD'S GRANDCHILDREN. NOW WHICH ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING ASSEMBLING AND HOPE WE'RE HOPING TO ENTER INTO THE INTO THE FLEET QUITE QUICKLY. SO THAT'S VIRGIN GALACTIC IN THE SPACE COME STATE SPACESHIP COMPANY AND THE HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT SIDE OF WHAT THE VIRGIN GROUP IS DOING IN SPACE. NOW IN A TRANSITION AND QUICKLY TALK ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUSINESS WHICH IS VIRGIN ORBIT. WAS MY CURRENT AT MY CURRENT POSITION HERE. AT THIS IS. AGAIN DOING SOMETHING PHILOSOPHICALLY VERY SIMILAR WHICH IS MAKING SPACE FLIGHTS MUCH MORE FREQUENT AND MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE WITHOUT SACRIFICING ANY RELIABILITY. BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT FOR ASTRONAUTS WERE DOING THIS FOR FOR SMALL SATELLITES. NOT LIKE VIRGIN GALACTIC INTO YOU SEE WE ALSO USE AN AIR LAUNCH SYSTEM SO AGAIN INSTEAD OF A ROCKET STANDING ON ITS TAIL AT VANDENBERG AIRFORCE BASE OR. CAPE CANAVERAL ANYONE ANYWHERE ELSE WE START WITH A ROCKET THAT STRAPPED UNDER THE WING OF A CARRIER AIRCRAFT. AND IN THIS CASE RATHER THAN USING A CUSTOM BUILT CARRIER AIRCRAFT WE USE THE WORLD'S MOST RELIABLE HIGH THE PROVEN INITIAL STAVING SAGE OF A ROCKET. WE USE THAT OF A BOEING SEVEN FOUR SEVEN ON IT IS NOWHERE NEAR AS IMPRESSIVE ARE CAPABLE IN MANY WAYS AS A FALCON NINE FOR STAGE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE WEEK THEY THEY GET A STANDING OVATION EVERY TIME THEY BRING ONE OF THOSE HOMES WHICH REALLY IS REMARKABLE. ABBOTT SIMPLY HAVEN'T HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF THEY'VE BEEN FINE FOR THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS OF THEM FANTASTIC SAFETY RECORD AND YOU CAN TURN AROUND ABOUT FORTY FIVE TIMES. IT DOES NOT GET US ANYWHERE NEAR AS CLOSE TO SPACE OBVIOUSLY IS THE FIRST STAGE BUT IT DOES GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF A HEAD START ON ON THE WAY TO SPACE AND. GIVE US A LOT OF. OF RESPONSIVENESS A LOT OF THAT LIKE WE CALL UP TIME THE ABILITY TO EXACT ACCESS DIFFERENT ORBITS WHICH IS PARTICULAR. BUT WHICH IS ADAM PARTICULARLY USEFUL OFTEN MAYBE TO OUR GOVERNMENT CLIENTS BUT ALSO INCREASINGLY TO OUR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AS WELL. WE'VE PAIRED THAT. VERY PROVEN AT AIRCRAFT WITH AS SIMPLE A ROCKET AS WE CAN MAKE. AND IT IS NOT THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE ROCKET IF YOU LOOK AT OUR THRUST NUMBERS NEXT TO. NEXT TO A FALCON NINE OR SOME THE OTHER ROCKETS ON THE MARKET WE LOOK MINUSCULE IMPUNITY BY COMPARISON AND WE DO THAT ON PURPOSE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THE PRICES LOW AS WE CAN POSSIBLY MAKE. WE ARE NOT TRYING TO TAKE HUMANS BEING BEINGS TO MARS AS WONDERFUL AS THAT IS. MY WIFE WORKS FOR THE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY ON MARS MISSION SO I SO I'M I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF MORE THOSE KINDS OF MISSIONS WERE JUST SIMPLY ANSWERING A DIFFERENT QUESTION. I WHICH IS HOW HOW HOW DO WE MAKE THE A TICKET PRICES LOWEST POSSIBLE WE DO THAT THEIR SIMPLICITY. AND WE DO THAT THROUGH SOME ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES I STARTING JUNE ENGAGED NOT ONLY THREE PRINTING BUT REALLY THE NEXT GENERATION OF SOME OF THE pMANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES SO THAT WE CAN BUILD THESE. IN RELATIVELY HIGH NUMBERS I'M TO PUT THIS IN INSISTS THAT IN A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT LAST YEAR IN THE ENTIRE WORLD THERE WERE NINETY LAUNCHES TO SPACE. THAT'S EVERY ROCKET OF EVERY CONFIGURATION WITH OTHER HUMANS ON TOP OR SATELLITES WITH ITS MILITARY OR COMMERCIAL OR CIVILIAN. WE WOULD LIKE TO DO TWENTY FOUR FLIGHTS PER YEAR IN THE VERY NEAR TERM I'M OUT OF OUR OUT OF OUR LUNCH FACILITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I NEVER FACTORED PARTICULAR HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO SO WE'D LIKE TO BE BUILDING AT. I USE HIGH RATE IN IN AIR QUOTES A VERY HIGH RATE FOR THE ROCKET INDUSTRY EVEN IF IT'S LOW RATE COMPARED TO AT SOME OF THE THINGS MANUFACTURED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO JUST TO GIVE YOU A QUICK UPDATE ON THE PROGRAM. WE PURCHASED THE AIRPLANE. IT WAS NICELY AN AIRPLANE THAT WAS BEING FLOWN BY ONE OF OUR SISTER COMPANIES VIRGIN ATLANTIC AND LIKE MOST AIRLINES THEY DON'T OWN THEIR AIRPLANES THERE RELEASE THEM THEIR LEASE WAS COMING UP AND WE WERE ABLE TO AT. TO COME IN AND BUY THE AIRPLANE. IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT IT WAS FLYING UNDER THE NAME COSMIC GIRL WHICH MADE IT SEEM A LITTLE BIT LIKE FATE THAT WE'RE USING IT AS A. AS A LAUNCH PLATFORM FOR OUT FOR SATELLITES OF A GARDEN AND LOOK BACK ON OUR HOME WORLD AS WELL AS EXPLORE THE COSMOS THERE. SO THE AIRCRAFT IS UP IN FLIGHT TEST NOW WE WE DID A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE MODIFICATION TO THE AIRCRAFT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE NOT ONLY DOING THINGS LIKE PULLING OUT ALL THE SEATS IN. THE LABORATORIES IN THE GALLEYS IN THE OVERHEAD BINS BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE WIRED THE AIRPLANE TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO AND CARRIED THE ROCKETS SAFELY. I'M SEVEN FOUR SEVENS IT TURNS OUT ARE ACTUALLY ALREADY BUILT TO CARRY A PAYLOAD UNDER THEIR WINGS ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T DO IT TERRIBLY OFTEN WE'RE LEVERAGING A PRE EXISTING BIT OF ENGINEERING CALLED THE FIFTH ENGINE CARRY POSITION. SO IF YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THE POSITION OF THE CEO OF AN AIRLINE IF YOU EVER NEED TO ORDER AN EXTRA JET ENGINE SO YOU HAVE INVENTORY ON HAND. THE WAY THAT'S DELIVERED TO YOU IS CARRIED UNDER THE WING OF THE SEVEN FOUR SEVEN. AM WHAT WE'RE CARRYING IS NOT AN AIRCRAFT ENGINE IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT SIZE LIVE A DIFFERENT MASS. BUT IT WAS AWFULLY NICE TO BE ABLE TO GO TO ENGINEERING THAT BOEING DID THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS AGO THAT HAS A PERFECT SAFETY RECORD AND SAY OKAY LET'S USE THAT AND HOW DO WE HOW DO WE BUILD UPON THAT. I'M WE HAVE BUILT BY SEVERAL ROCKETS AND ALSO YOU SOME MORE PICTURES OF THOSE LATER BY THIS IS THAT A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE FIRST FULLY ASSEMBLED ROCKET TO LEAVE OUR FACTORY DOORS AT LATE LAST YEAR. WHICH WENT UP TO OUT TO THE MOJAVE AIR AND SPACE PORT WHERE WE CONDUCTED A FULL SET OF WHAT WE CALL LAUNCH CAMPAIGN REHEARSALS THESE ARE ESSENTIALLY. WET DRESS REHEARSALS WHERE WE PRACTICE MATING THE. THE ROCKET TO SOMETHING THAT STIMULATES THE WING OF THE AIRPLANE WE PRACTICE FUELING IT WOULD PASS IT BY TRIES AND WE GET ALL OF OUR. ALL OF OUR HARD WORKING TECHNICIANS IN AN OPERATOR'S AT THEIR AT THEIR VARIOUS POSITIONS IN MISSION CONTROL AND DO EVERYTHING UP INTO THE MOMENT WHERE WE WOULD PRESS GO. ESSENTIAL AND I JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE THAT WERE ABLE TO RUN THOSE PROCESSES UP VERY GRATEFUL TO TO REPORT THAT THOSE WENT OFF EXTRAORDINARILY WELL. WE HAVE FINISHED DEVELOPING ARE NOW IN THE LATER PHASES OF QUALIFYING ALL OF THE MAJOR STRUCTURES OF THE ROCKET. FOR THE MOST PART STRUCTURES TESTING IS LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT A TANK AND HOPING IT DOESN'T BREAK AT THIS IS ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING IMAGES THAT I COULD FIND OF A VAT OF AYE AYE NOSE CONE OR A PAYLOAD FAIRING OPEN. BUT WE ARE REALLY PUTTING EVERYTHING THROUGH ITS PACES ESSENTIALLY WE HAVE AN ENTIRE SECTION OF OUR FACTORY THAT I'D LIKE TO. LOVINGLY REFER TO AS THE MEDIEVAL TORTURE CHAMBER WHERE WE TAKE ALL THE PARTS THAT WE BUILT AND WE TRY AND BREAK THEM UP ON THE THEORY THAT IF THEY'RE EVER GONNA BREAK WE'D LIKE TO BREAK THEM ON PURPOSE IN THE FACTORY BEFORE THEY BREAK BY ACCIDENT SOMEWHERE ELSE. AYE SO THAT'S THE PROCESS THAT WE ARE WERE IN THE THICK OF RIGHT NOW. I'M WE'VE DESIGNED ALL OF OUR OWN ROCKET ENGINES. RATHER THAN BUYING THEM FROM AN OVERSEAS SUPPLIER AND I'M WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE BUILT THOSE IN HOUSE. AND ARE HAVE BEEN TESTING THEM FOR MANY YEARS AND THEY ARE DESIGNED AND BUILT. AND AND I IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY TESTED UP IN KERN COUNTY I'M WE HAVE BEEN TESTING THEM FOR A LONG TIME AT FULL DURATION AND AT FULL THRUST. THE TESTING IS NOT DONE AND IN FACT WILL NEVER BE DONE YOU KNOW AUTOMOBILE ENGINE STILL GET BETTER EVERY YEAR AND THOSE HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR AWHILE SO YOU NEVER QUITE PUT THE PEN DOWN. WE ARE TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE DONE ALL THE RISKIEST THINGS NOW WHICH I NEED TO DO OTHER ISSUES THINGS EVERY TIME AND THAT THAT'S REALLY DID THAT THE HEART OF THE PROGRAM THAT WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW. AND THEN LASTLY HERE'S JUST A QUICK SHOT THIS IS FROM ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO. OF OUR OF OUR FACILITY I'M AT THE DOUGLAS PARK IN THAT IN LONG BEACH. AS YOU CAN SEE THERE WE ARE JUST BUILDING A ROCKET WE ARE BUILDING MANY ROCKETS I'M WE HEARD. WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY WERE REALLY HARDWARE RICH AND SO WE'VE TAKEN THE SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL POSITION OF? NOT JUST BUILDING ONE FLIGHT ONE ROCKET PRIOR TO ARE MADE IN FLIGHT GOING AHEAD AND TAKING THE RISK. BUILDING MULTIPLE OF THEM. WE TRY NOT TO BE GUILTY OF HUBRIS AND WE RECOGNIZE THE HISTORY OF THE MADE IN FIGHTS OF ROCKETS THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS GO PERFECTLY I'M SURE WE'LL FIND SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO IMPROVE. BUT AT THE OFFICE. GOING HAVE OUR ENTIRE TEAM FOCUS ON THOSE PARTS WE WANT TO IMPROVE AND SAY HEY EVERYTHING ELSE IS BUILT EVERYTHING ELSE IS READY WHEN YOU'RE READY TO GO WERE READY TO FLY AGAIN. THIS ORBITER O'CLOCK THIS IS VIRGIN ORBIT. AND LASTLY I WANT AND JUST WITH SOME SOME NOTES ABOUT OUR ACTIVITIES IN THE COMMUNITY. STEM EDUCATION IS THAT MATTER VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART PERSONALLY A LOT OF MY VOLUNTEER ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF BUSINESS HOURS. ARE AND NOW SPEAKING TO STUDENTS OP I DO PARTICULARLY THE COLLEGE LEVEL BUT MY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE DOING IT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE. TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LEVEL I'M WE OPEN UP A AT VIRGIN ORBIT WE OPEN UP OUR FACTORY TO LOCAL SCHOOLS ON THE THIRD SATURDAY OF EVERY SINGLE MONTH AND AND BRING IN LOTS OF OTHER TOURS UP BY EXCEPTION FOR FOR CLASSROOMS THAT CAN'T COME IN ON. ON WEEKENDS NOW WE HAVE BROUGHT THAT. THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS IN THROUGH THE FACTORY AS WELL AS GOING OUT INTO SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'D TO SAY NOTHING OF THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT WE DO ONLINE THROUGH SKY PER WHAT YOUR PICK YOUR FAVORITE THAT. ONLINE TOOL AYE SO REALLY PRIZE. GOING OUT THERE AND INSPIRING THE NEXT GENERATION OF OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO COME AND WORK FOR US OR OVERCOME THAT MISTER CASEY AND START THEIR OWN SATELLITE COMPANY THAT MIGHT WANT TO BUY A FLIGHT FROM US OR JUST OTHERWISE CONTRIBUTE TO THAT. THE WEALTH OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE AYE WE ALSO HAVE BEGUN CONTRIBUTING IN THE FORM OF SCHOLARSHIPS AND GRANTS THAT GO OUT TO STUDENTS AT PRIMARILY HERE IN AT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN LASTLY AGAIN WE WE REALLY PRIZE. I BUILDING BUILDING THE WORK FORCE BETWEEN THE THREE COMPANIES I'VE SPOKEN TO YOU ABOUT VIRGIN GALACTIC THE SPACESHIP COMPANY IN VIRGIN ORBIT WE UP EMPLOYEE WELL OVER A THOUSAND FULL TIME EMPLOYEES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THOSE ARE OVERWHELMINGLY VERY HIGH SKILL VERY HIGH WAGE JOBS. WE ALSO. ARE BRINGING A LOT OF NOT ONLY THE MOST SEASONED AND EXPERIENCED PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME TO US FROM SPACE ACTS OR BOEING ARE LOUGHEED OR NORTHROP OR NASSER THE AIRFORCE WE ALSO EMPLOYEE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE ARE THEIR FIRST JOB DIRECTLY OUT OF SCHOOL. AT ONE OF OUR GREAT ENTRYWAYS INTO THAT. PROGRAM IS. IS A SORT OF OUR STEM PIPELINE OF STUDENTS COMING TO US AS INTERNS AND WE'VE GOT WE'VE ACTUALLY JUST SET UP A WHOLE SECTION OF OUR FACTORY FLOOR AYE DOWN AT MERGING OR DIDN'T KNOW VIRGIN GALACTIC IS DONE THE SAME FOR. OUR NEWEST CROP OF INTERNS WHO ALL SHOW UP ON MONDAY. WE DO DRAW FROM SCHOOLS ALL AROUND THE UNITED STATES BUT OBVIOUSLY WITH THE FANTASTIC STRENGTH OF THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM A LOT OF THOSE STUDENTS COME FROM OUR FROM RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WANTED TO MENTION THAT AS WELL I AGAIN IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE AND AN HONOR TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND I VERY MUCH LOOK FOR TO YOUR QUESTION. I VERY MUCH WANT TO WELCOME THE. CHAIR OF OUR ASSEMBLY JOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE MS AYE QUIRK SILVA. THIS QUIRK SILVA WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY NEW. WELCOMING REMARKS. I DID COME IN AFTER YOU STARTED BUT IT'S VERY VERY INTERESTING PRESENTATION I CAN SEE HOW EXCITED YOU ARE BY PRESENTING AT AND I THINK A. JUST YOUR ENTHUSIASM A PRESENTING AYE LIFE I BELIEVE WOULD GET QUITE A FEW STUDENTS INTERESTED. BUT ITEM IN PLACE YOUR MANUFACTURING FRIENDS BACK OUT THERE AND I KNOW IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE QUITE A. FEW OF THE OTHER SUPPLIERS IN THAT AREA SO I'M. VERY EXCITED TO SEE YOU GUYS INNOVATE THANK YOU VERY KIND WORDS BRIGITTE. ALRIGHT. SO IF I MAY LIKE TO START OFF WITH SOME QUESTIONS FOR MISTER POMERANTZ. LOT OF EXCITING STUFF. ONE IS THE. THE TARGET DATE FOR THEM. GENERAL PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO BUY A TICKET AND GO OUT IN SPACE. AS SOON AS WE CAN MAKE IT NAM A RICHARD OBVIOUSLY IS INCREDIBLY EAGER AS ARE AS ARE ALL OF US AND WE'VE BEEN YOU KNOW ARE POURING OUR HEARTS OUT INTO THE SYSTEM FOR FOR OUT FOR A LONG TIME AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT UP IN THE AIR. THAT SAID OBVIOUSLY. SAFETY IS THAT SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT HERE WE WE WE WON'T PUT UPON THE VEHICLE UNTIL WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN DO SO IN A WAY THAT AS I MENTIONED NOT ONLY WILL BE SAFE IT WILL BE REALLY ENJOYABLE. I'M ON THE AYE HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT SIDE AS I MENTIONED. VIRGIN GALACTIC ARE ARE IN THE TEST FLIGHT PROGRAM RIGHT NOW AND THEY HAVE BITTEN OFF A LOT OF THE MAJOR RISKS BUT STILL HAVE SOME YET TO GO. I THINK THE ASPIRATION AS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS THAT THAT THAT. ROUTINE FLIGHTS OF COMMERCIAL PASSENGERS AREN'T AREN'T TOO FAR OFF YOU KNOW MORE IN THAT YEAR. TWO YEARS KIND OF RANGE IT CERTAINLY NOT DECADE BUT IT'S ALSO NOT TOMORROW THERE'S THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK TO DO. I'M ON THE VERGE IN ORBIT SIDE OUR AIM IS TO BE IN COMMERCIAL SERVICE BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR SO POINT OFTEN ORBITAL TEST FLIGHT WHICH WILL HAVE PAYLOADS ON BOARD BUT THEY'LL ALL BE OUR OWN. AND HOPEFULLY TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE THAT AND TO GET INTO COMMERCIAL SERVICE THAT BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. SO I AM NOT SURE IF I HEARD YOU RIGHT TELL THAT SPACE TOURISM SIDE MADE ME AND ALWAYS TOUGH TO SAY AND WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM FROM PAST MISTAKES ABOUT GIVING TWENTY TO FIND A DATE ON IT THEM OR SO IT IS PROBABLY MORE IN. IN THE IN THE YOUR LIKE TIME LIKE THAT A YEAR IS FROM NOW AND IT COULD BE A LITTLE SOONER IF EVERYTHING GOES SWIMMINGLY PERFECT HA HA. THINGS GENERALLY DON'T AS THOUGH IT'S A COULD BE A LITTLE LONGER THAN THAT BUT IT'S IN THAT SORT OF ORDER OF MAGNITUDE TO HAVE MISTER BRANSON POSSIBLY YES BE. THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY OUR AIM AHA. THAT'S EXCITING IT IS EXCITING AYE SIR SO. HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT YOU HAVE A THOUSAND HIGHLY SKILLED HIGHLY PAID JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH AND I. HAPPY TO SEE THE. THE MANUFACTURING OF OF SOME OF THOSE. ROCKETS TAKING PLACE IN THE CITY OF LONG BEACH. SO LIKE TO ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION I ASKED THE SPACEX Y. CALIFORNIA. AYE AYE AYE EIGHT OVERWHELMINGLY THE REASON WHY ALL OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE IN CALIFORNIA IS FOR THE TALENT AND IT'S FOR THE IDEAS IT'S FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE ALREADY HERE. YOU KNOW VIRGIN GALACTIC WHICH WAS THE FIRST OF THE THREE VIRGIN SPACE COMPANIES GOT ITS START LICENSING TECHNOLOGIES FROM SCALED COMPOSITES WHICH IS NOW A SUBSIDIARY OF NORTHROP GRUMMAN. AND THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BASED. IN IN MOJAVE RIGHT AT THE MOJAVE AIR AND SPACE PORT. THERE IS NO OTHER ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD THAT LIKE THAT THAT HAS THAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY AND AND ALSO. TO GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR MYSTERIES IN THE NEXT PANEL THERE IS ANOTHER FACILITY IN THE WORLD QUITE LIKE MOJAVE AREN'T SPACEPORT IT'S JUST A FANTASTIC PLACE. TO HAVE REALLY CREATIVE IDEAS AND TO GET THEM OUT IN THE FIELD AND TO TEST THEM AND TO LEARN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IF IT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA ARE TERRIBLE IDEA OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. SIMILARLY FOR FOR VIRGIN ORBIT WHEN WE STARTED TO SCALE UP AND WE WERE MOVING OFF OF A FEW IDEAS ON COMPUTER SCREENS AND AND OUT INTO THE REAL WORLD. WE NEEDED TO ACCESS A READY. SUPPLY OF OF TALENTED LABORERS. AND A FULL SUPPLY CHAIN AND AND WE CERTAINLY FOUND THAT IN SPADES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IF YOU'LL PERMIT ME A BRIEF ANECDOTE NAM WHEN WE FIRST MOVED INTO OUR FACTORY RIGHT THERE IN DOUGLAS PARK IN THE CITY OF LONG BEACH. AT THE TIME VIRGIN ORBIT HAD ABOUT EVEN THOUGH WE WERE CALLED VIRGIN ORBIT WITH THE TIME WE WERE DEPARTMENT BUT I'LL USE THE TERM VIRGIN ORBIT FOR SIMPLICITY. OF THE TIME WE HAD ABOUT THIRTY FIVE EMPLOYEES AND HARDLY ANY HARDWARE AND WE MOVED INTO A BUILDING WITH A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT MANUFACTURING SPACE. AT LITERALLY THE FIRST WEEKEND THAT WE HELD THE KEYS TO THE BUILDING WE HAD A JOB FAIR AND AN OPEN HOUSE. IN THE BUILDING. WE WERE LOOKING TO HIRE ABOUT FIFTY EMPLOYEES IN THE NEAR TERM WE FIGURED IF WE CAN GET A THOUSAND PEOPLE TO COME AND APPLY FOR IT TALK ABOUT IT AT ABOUT FIFTY JOBS WE BE FEELING PRETTY GOOD. OUT WE STOPPED COUNTING ONLY HAD SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE PARKING LOT AND THAT WAS AROUND ELEVEN AM THE EVENT WENT FOR ANOTHER THREE OR FOUR HOURS. TO JUST SORT OF SHOWED US THAT THERE WAS A READY WORK FORCE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY INCREDIBLY DEDICATED AND INCREDIBLY TALENTED IN THIS IN THIS SECTOR. AND THAT HAS CONTINUED TO RING TRUE OUT WHEN WE NEED SOMETHING WE CAN ALMOST ALWAYS FIND IT WHETHER IT'S GOING NEXT DOOR TO CAL STATE LONG BEACH. OR IT'S TALKING TO RETIREES WHO HAVE SUPPORTED THE AIRFORCE MISSION OR THE NASA MISSION OVER THE YEARS. WE CAN'T FIND IT LOCALLY IT'S NOT VERY HARD TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO COME AND MOVED TO CALIFORNIA. AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER ANOTHER BIG TOOL IN OUR TOOLKIT AS WELL. MISS QUIRK SILVA AYE YOU MENTION THAT THERE WERE ABOUT NINETY FLIGHTS INTERNATIONALLY COM. INTO SPACE. HOW DO YOU COORDINATE THAT AS FAR AS YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOU ARE HOPING TO GET TO TWENTY? TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE A YEAR SO IS THERE HOW DO YOU COORDINATE THAT YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AFFECT I GUESS IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AT MISTER COUNSEL BE ON THE NEXT PANEL COULD PROBABLY GOING TO EVEN MORE DEATH THAN I CAN ON THAT ONE BUT BROADLY SPEAKING. ALL OF OUR FIGHTS WILL BE LICENSED BY THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION ORGANISED ACCOUNTS ON HIS PEERS IN. IN THE OFFICE OF COMMERCIAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION. WHO WHO WILL GOVERN? IT ESSENTIALLY EVERYTHING THAT WE DO WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. GOING THROUGH ALL THE RIGHT THAT. PROCEDURES TO TO NOTIFY YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE DO OPERATE TAKE OFF FROM AN AIRPORT SO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING OUT THE RIGHT NOTICE TO. AIRMEN ARE NOTICES TO MARINERS OF GOING OUT OVER THE WATER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. TAKING THE RIGHT STEPS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE ON INVOLVED PUBLIC AND OF HAVE GOVERNMENT OR CIVILIAN PROPERTY ANYWAY ANYWHERE NEAR OF OUR FOR OUR FACILITIES. SO THAT'S THE PRIMARY OFFICE THAT WE WORK WITH WE YOU DO ALSO REQUIRE THINGS LIKE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS FCC LICENSING FOR THAT. FOR THE RADIO FREQUENCIES THAT WERE USING TO COMMUNICATE THAT NOW KNOW A LICENSING FOR THE CAMERAS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE ON BOARD THE VEHICLE AS WELL BUT THE BULK OF THE WORK WILL HAPPEN TO THE FAA. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHAT CAN THE THE STATE? THE STATE TO TO SUPPORT HER. YOUR EXCITING ACTIVITIES IN IN CALIFORNIA BOSS AND GENERAL WE WE FEEL VERY VERY WELL SUPPORTED. A BUY OUT BY OUR INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTATIVES AND BY THE COMMITTEE AS A WHOLE SO AGAIN THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT. I THINK SOMETIMES BY THE INHERENT NEWNESS OF WHAT WE ARE DOING THERE IS ALWAYS QUESTION MARKS AND UNCERTAINTY WE OFTENTIMES RUN INTO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE USE AN AIRPLANE TO LAUNCH A ROCKET INTO THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT KAY'S AT AN AIRPLANE OR IS IT SPACES DEMINT. HOW IS A TAXED AND HOW THE OTHER A? THE NICE THING IS THAT EVEN WHEN IT'S CONFUSING WE'VE ALWAYS FOUND THE ABILITY TO WORK IT IN AND GREAT GOOD FAITH AND HAVE FANTASTIC WORKING RELATIONS WITH WITH ARE REGULATED WRITERS WITH THAT WITH TAXATION OFFICIALS EVERYONE ELSE AT AT LOCAL STATE. COUNTY AND AND FEDERAL LEVELS AND THEIR SO EVEN WHEN ISSUES ARE HARD AND CONFUSING AND BURKE WERE GETTING THEM GETTING THE WORK DONE THE WORK WELL. I WOULD SAY THE CONTINUING THEME ABOUT AND THIS ALIGNS WELL WITH THAT WITH THAT WITH LEGISLATION THAT YOU'VE PASSED IN AND AND OTHERS THAT ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION NOW IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S AN OPEN DIALOGUE. BECAUSE THERE WILL BE SOME UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS IN THE FUTURE FOR EVERYONE OF THESE COMPANIES I AM SURE. AND THERE WILL BE. REGULATIONS ARE WRITTEN NOT ANTICIPATING SOME WILD IDEA THAT AN ENTREPRENEUR IS GOING TO WALK INTO MISTER CASES OUT HIS WITH OFFICE WITHIN THE NEAR FUTURE. AND SUGGESTED SO HAVING THAT ABILITY I'M TO ADD TO IT TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THAT TO DISTINGUISH MEMBERS AND MEMBERS OF STAFF. IN SESSIONS LIKE THIS IN AN OTHERWISE IS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND AND I I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FURRIER AT PROGRESS IN THAT STATE. THANK YOU. WHAT DO YOU USE ANY OF THE? MATERIALS FROM HYDRO FLOW OR FROM. ALCOA BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH IN MY DISTRICT AFFILIATED HYDROPHONES WRITTEN THERE THE FAMILY ON BUT I KNOW THEY DO THE PIPING. AND ALCOA DOES ALL THE BOLTS. THEY SAY THAT FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS THERE'S TWO SITES IN FULLERTON. I BELIEVE IN A LITTLE PLUG YES I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS YES BUT IF I MAY PERHAPS ALL TAKEN OUT AND THEN WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU SO SO I CAN CONFIRM FOR CERTAIN. RIGHT MISTER LACKEY. WELL OBVIOUSLY I HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF. DURING THE FACILITIES AND WE'RE VERY VERY PROUD OF. THE PROGRESS YOU GUYS HAVE MADE AND. WANT TO CONTINUE TO PARTNER TO. THE STILL TAKE YOUR SUCCESS. AND NOT BE AN IMPEDIMENT AND SOMETIMES THAT CAN BE A BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN. BOTH OF US CAN CONTROL. I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH YOU TAKING THE TIME TO COME AND VISIT US AND ALL THE HELP THAT YOU YOU HAVE GIVEN US. ALRIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SURE MISTER POMERANTZ THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE INVITATION. LAST BUT NOT LEAST FOR PANEL NUMBER ONE SEAN CASEY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE SILICON VALLEY SPACE CENTER. WELCOME SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ME. LOOK FOR RISEN TATIAN HERE THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR INVITING ME. UP TO PRESENT TODAY AND ALSO LIKE TO. THANK. A USER FOR INCLUDING. OUR GROUP OF MORE THAN CALIFORNIAN. START UPS IN THIS PROCESS. I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT WE HAVE A GROWING MOMENTUM OF EARLY STAGE COMPANIES IN THE BAY AREA. AND OF THAT. THEIR REPRESENTATION IS IMPORTANT. TO THIS PROCESS OF A PREPARED STATEMENT HERE WHICH I'D LIKE TO READ AND GO TO SOME SLIDES. TALKING ABOUT THE INDUSTRY. THOM MY NAME IS SEAN CASEY I'M I'M. SERVE SEVERAL ROLES ONE OF WHICH IS I HEAD OF THE SILICON VALLEY SPACE ON OUR WHICH IS AN INCUBATOR AND ACCELERATOR FOR EARLY STAGE COMPANIES. IN THE SPACE SECTOR PRIOR TO SELL VALLEY SPACE CENTER I SPENT. FIFTEEN PLUSYEARS WORKING AT NASA AMES ON THE AIRBORNE ASTRONOMY PROGRAM MY PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND IS AS AN AIRBORNE ASTRONOMER HAVING BEEN AT NASA GODDARD AND ALSO AT NASA AMES. SOPHIA THE STRATOSPHERIC OBSERVATORY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE ME IS NOW BASED IN PALMDALE AND SO I'VE HAD DONE. HAD THE PLEASURE OF GETTING DOWN THERE AND KNOWING SOME OF OUR. AEROSPACE COLLEAGUES IN THAT AREA ASIDE FROM BEING UP HERE. IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK ABOUT THE NEW SPACE INDUSTRY WHICH IS LOCALLY WHAT PEOPLE REFER TO AS HARTMAN ORIEL SPACE WE SEE A LOT OF PRESS ASSOCIATED WITH. SOME OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE PRESENTED TO A PREVIOUSLY SPACEX AND VIRGIN GALACTIC ó ALSO THEIR SUB BLUE ORIGIN. AND. STRADDLE LAUNCH ON THEM. I FEEL THAT THERE IS AN EMPHASIS ON WHAT QUOTE BILLIONAIRES ARE DOING IN THIS INDUSTRY. WITH LESS OF AN EMPHASIS ON A WHAT SMALLER MERE MORTAL ENTREPRENEURS ARE DOING I THINK THE SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEPENDS UPON. THOSE OF NAM LET A LESS MONEY TO INDIVIDUALS. AND THEIR ROLE TO FUNCTION IN OUR SILICON VALLEY SOCIETY A WHICH WE'VE KNOWN. IS VERY POPULAR FOR GOOGLE ONE FAKE FACEBOOK IN AND SOME OF THOSE COMPANIES. I ALSO ASK. ARE NGUYEN TWO ONE. OUR SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE SOME REPORTS THAT I'VE RUN ACROSS CENTER FROM GOLDMAN SACHS OF THE BRYCE. DONE. OF THE BRYCE GROUP AND. SPACE ANGELS ABOUT THE GROWTH OF THE NEW SPACE INDUSTRY I SENT THESE TWO ARE WHEN THIS MORNING SO THEY MADE UP IN YOUR PACKETS. TODAY BUT I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE INDUSTRY IS GROWING. I HAVE. ALSO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE COMMERCIAL SPACEFLIGHT FEDERATION IN WASHINGTON DC. AND THEY HAVE FOR IN THAT CAPACITY TRAVELED AROUND THE COUNTRY TALKING TO A VARIETY OF GROUPS IN FLORIDA AND TEXAS AND NEW YORK. AND. OTHER STATES AND I SEE A GROWING MOMENTUM OF SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP NOT JUST HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT ELSEWHERE. A ONE OF THE SLIDES UP LIKE TO PRESENT IS. AID FUNNY DIAGRAM OF VENTURE CAPITAL. AS ITS A ALLOCATED INTO THIS SECTOR THERE ARE SEVERAL. GOT A BIG HIGH POINTS OF FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. GENERALLY BETWEEN. LE TWO THOUSAND FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. YOU SEEN OUR A BUBBLING OF INTEREST WITHIN THE VENTURE CAPITAL COMMUNITY. PROBABLY MAXING OUT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PER YEAR OSCILLATING IT BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED BUT IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN WE'VE SEEN BANNER YEARS FOR VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT. SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS ARE DOMINATED BY. COMPANIES LIKE SPACEX AND. ONE WEB. BUT WHAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN IS A GROWING INTEREST AND. THE SMALLER START UPS OF WHICH HER ROUTE WHICH ARE SHOWN HERE AND CERTAINLY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE'VE SEEN A GROWTH OF THOSE. FUNDING FOR SMALLER SIR. SMALLER START UPS. NUMBER ONE WEB IS A CONSOLATION OF OVER EIGHT HUNDRED SATELLITES THAT ARE POISED TO PROVIDE GLOBAL INTERNET COVERAGE AND INDEED THE GROWTH THAT YOU SPACE INDUSTRY MAY HANG UPON THE SUCCESS OF. ONE WEB AND SOME OTHER COMPANIES. I WOULD NOTE THAT. THE ONE WEB CONSOLATION IS ACTUALLY A CONCEIVED OF HEARING CALIFORNIA WHEREAS THE SATELLITE CONSTRUCTION IS ACTUALLY MOVING DOWN TO. DOING THAT MOVING DOWN TO FLORIDA FOR THAT CONSOLATION. THAT TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT IN THIS GROWING NEW SPACE SECTOR ARE THE SAME TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN DISRUPTING A WIDE VARIETY. OF OF INDUSTRIES THIS IS REPORT FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN FROM MACKENZIE. TALKING ABOUT DUH DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND I LISTS THOSE HERE BECAUSE WE SEE THOSE SAME THINGS APPLY TO THE SMALL SATELLITE SECTOR. IN PARTICULAR. MOBILE. COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS. THE ABILITY OF A AYE AND. ROBOTICS ALONG WITH ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING AND. SOLAR PANEL COME. IMPROVEMENTS AND EFFICIENCY. SO A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT IS IMPACTING OUR INDUSTRY IS WITH THE COMPANY. ONE OF THE EARLIEST. SPACE STARTUPS CALLED PLANET LANDS ó IT'S NOW CALLED PLANET AND I SHOW HERE. SOME OF THE FOUNDERS NAM. I'M AND WILL MARSHALL AND A CHRIS WELLHAUSEN WITH THOSE STEVE JURVETSON AN ANGEL INVESTOR AND VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTOR. HOW THAT'S WELL KNOWN HERE IN SILICON VALLEY OF STEVE IS ACTUALLY HOLDING ONE OF THE EARLY DOVE SATELLITES WHICH IS A CUBE SET TECHNOLOGY BASED UPON A CONCEPT DEVELOPED BY? TILE RESEARCH FACULTY WELL BOB TWIGS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY. THIS TECHNOLOGY PRETTY MUCH BEEN AROUND FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS PRIOR TO. SPACE AS PRIOR TO PLANETS ADOPTION BUT. BOTH WILL AND CHRIS WORKING AT NASA AMES WERE VERY FAMILIAR WITH P. WHARTON'S VISION OF SMALL SATELLITES AS THEY APPLY TO THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY. SO CHRIS AND WILL. AND OTHERS SPUN OUT OF NASA AMES TO FORM PLANET AND. THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY AND CONSTERNATION ABOUT THE UTILITY OF SMALL SATELLITES ON HIM LOW WORTH ORBIT. THE FACT THAT YOU'RE IN LOW EARTH ORBIT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE A BENIGN RADIATION AND. AND THAT ALLOWS YOU TO USE WHAT ARE TERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES UMMAH IN THAT. ON IN IT AT THAT AT THOSE ALTITUDES. SO. MAHOOD PLANET. INITIALLY FLEW A A FEW SATELLITES AND TODAY HAS GROWN TO OVER TWO HUNDRED SATELLITES IN LOW EARTH ORBIT THAT PROVIDE A TWICE DAILY SNAPSHOT. OF OF THE PLANET AS AN ASTRONOMER I KNOW THAT EVERY TIME YOU BUILD A NEW OBSERVATIONAL FACILITY YOU'RE GOING TO DERIVE NEW RESULTS. AND. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHATEVER WE HAPPEN TO BE OBSERVING IN THIS CASE OF ITS THE EARTH. OF PLANET ALLIES ALSO LEVERAGE TO GROWING SUPPLY CHAIN. AND WITH SECONDARY LAUNCH CAPABILITIES ON VEHICLES LIKE SPACEX AND OTHERS THREE ABLE TO DEPLOY THE SATELLITES IN LOW EARTH ORBIT I SHOW HERE THE SATELLITES BEING DEPLOYED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WHICH WAS A RELATIVELY NOVEL. CONCEPT AND PIONEERED BY THE SMALL SATELLITE COMMUNITY HERE AND IT'S HIGHER PAYLOAD OF SMALL SATELLITES OR SHIPPED UP TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. AND THEN DEPLOYED BY ASTRONAUTS ON A BOOM SHOWN HERE A COMPANY CALLED NARAL RACKS ACTUALLY OF. SERVES THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND THE SMALL SATELLITE COMMUNITY FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF SATELLITES IN LOWER THOR AND LOWER EARTH ORBIT. THE SATELLITES AS YOU CAN SEE BY WITH STEVE ARE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BREAD BOX. THIS IS. THAT TECHNOLOGIES ABLE DEVELOPED AT A PRICE POINT WHICH IS AMENABLE TO VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT. SO WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH NEW SPACE. IS NOT THAT VENTURE CAPITALISTS HAVE EMBRACED SPACE IT'S THAT SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP HAS MOVED INTO THE FUNDING ENVELOPE WHICH IS TYPICAL OF A SILICON VALLEY STARTUP. WITH A SEED ROUND SERIES A SERIES PAYS CERES CITY AT. YOU KNOW SAY HALF MILLION DOLLARS ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE. A. A TECHNOLOGY MILESTONES AND MARKET RETIRED AND RETIRE MARKET RISK. NUMBER WHILE THEY'RE TAKING INTRODUCTIONS OF CHARGES OF FUNDING. AN EXAMPLE OF. PLANETS HOA ENABLED CAPABILITY THESE DAYS IMPLANTED THOSE ALSO GONE TO REMOTE OF ACQUIRING AND THE GROWTH OF THE COMPANY. FROM ITS START IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TO TODAY HAS PULLED IN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THEY'VE DEVELOPED OR SMALL SATELLITE PROGRAM AND THEY'VE ALSO ACQUIRED SOME ADDITIONAL SATELLITE FACILITIES. THIS IS A IN ANIMATION THAT GONNA. I HOPE THIS COMES UP HERE. BUT WHEN THE WIND IT BACK. A SERIES OF IMAGES TAKEN WITH THE PLANET CAPE HOA PLANET FACILITIES. OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS. SHOWING THE BUILD OUT OF. THE CAST WOULD GET A FACTORY. THE DATA. THAT YOU GET FROM THESE PROGRAMS. I'M. LET'S. THE DATA FROM THESE PROGRAMS. ASSISTS BOAT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW FRIES ON THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AGRICULTURE MINING. FINANCE ON I OF A NUMBER OF OTHER EXAMPLES WHICH FOR THE. BREVITY OF THIS PRESENTATION I HAVE NOT INCLUDED. BUT SATELLITE IMAGING ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY INTO OUR ECONOMY. UNLIKE WHAT WE'VE HAD BEFORE I HAD A A NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEVEL IT ALSO ALLOWS US TRANSPARENCY INTO ECONOMIES WHERE. A WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF TRANSPARENCY WHAT IS THE OIL USE AND. IN. I CHINA OR CALL USE IN ERA IN INDIA. PLANET O. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SMALL SATELLITE PROGRAM HAS ACTUALLY PIONEERED A THE USE OF THESE THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER FIRMS. MANY OF WHICH YOU'RE HERE IN THE. IN THE BAY AREA. COMPANIES. THAT I'VE LISTED HERE. FOR EMERGING COMPANIES OUR PLANET AND ASTRA DIGITAL AND SADDLE LOGIC THEY'RE ALL LOOKING AT UNIQUE VERTICALS NOT TO SERVE IN MARKETS. OF AGRICULTURE AND VIDEO A SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR DATA IS BEING DONE BY CAPELLA SPACE. THERE ARE TECHNOLOGIES WHICH SHOW PROMISE IN SPACE WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN FLOWN THAT ARE BEING FLOWN A. I DEVELOPED BY ENTREPRENEURS A COMMUNICATION COMPANIES LIKE AUDACITY AND STRATUS. GPS OCCULTATION COMPANIES LIKE SPIRE WE'RE ABLE TO MEASURE. PERHAPS PROPERTIES AT THE END BURSTS ATMOSPHERE. AND. DATA ANALYSIS COMPANIES COMPANIES THAT. DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE HARDWARE BETTER USING THE DATA THAT COMES FROM OTHER SATELLITE COMPANIES AND MAKING THAT LAST MARK THAT LAST MILE PLAY. TO. TO CUSTOMERS. SPACE DEBRIS FROM LEO LABS AND MADE THE SPACE FOCUSING ON ON ORBIT FIBER IN IT MANUFACTURING. I THINK MADE IN SPACE IS A UNIQUE COMPANY BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY PIONEERED ITS TECHNOLOGY USING SUBORBITAL FLIGHTS OF BEFORE DEPLOYING TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. THE FIBER THAT THE PLANNING ON MAKING. HAS THE BENEFIT OF BEING HIGH THROUGHPUT. AND. LOW ABSORPTION COEFFICIENTS TO ENABLE BROAD SPECTRUM AND THEN HIGH DATA RATES UNLIKE A WHAT WE'VE SEEN PREVIOUSLY. A WHEN I LOOK AT VEHICLES LIKE VIRGIN GALACTIC AND THEIR USE IS A RESEARCH PLATFORM NOT ONLY IS IT. JUST FOR A TOURISTS AND EDUCATORS BUT FOR PDB PLAY MAIDEN SPACE DID ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED PARABOLAS ON THE ZERO G. VEHICLE TO PROVE OUT FOR THREE D. PRINTING TECHNOLOGY. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT USE OF THAT VEHICLE BEFORE GOING TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. WITH THIS WE EXPECT TO SEE A WIDE VARIETY. OF. SMALL SATELLITE GUN COMPANIES AS I'VE SHOWN IN THE LAST SLIDE I WOULD SAY OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IS PROJECTED DOUBLE SEE ABOUT A THREE X. INCREASE. IN SMALL SATELLITES IN LOW EARTH ORBIT. THERE ARE NUMBER OF INCUBATORS AND ACCELERATORS FOR INSTANCE THE FOUNDERS INSTITUTE. OF HAS THEIR STAR FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM THAT EXPECTS TO GRADUATE OVER FIVE HUNDRED. NEW SPACE START UPS. OVER THE NEXT. SEVEN YEARS THIS IS IDEA RESI THE FOUNDER OF FOUNDER THE FOUNDER OF FOUNDERS INSTITUTE OF SPEAKING WITH STEVE JURVETSON ONE OF THE EARLY INVESTORS. IN PLANET LABS. ALL OF THE COMPANIES THAT I'VE LISTED PREVIOUSLY OUR EARLY SEED STAGE SERIES A SERIES B.. COMPANIES. YES MA'AM. SO IT KIND OF GOES BACK TO THE QUESTION I ASKED YOU ABOUT. OF RIGHT NOW THERE'S SOMEONE A MINIMAL. TRAFFIC IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT. I. YOU SAID NINE THE MENU OR EXPECT INTO. YOU KNOW REALLY INCREASE THAT WITH WHAT ALL THE OTHER START UPS AND SO FORTH RIGHT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW HOW ARE WE LOOKING AT MANAGING THAT IN WHO WOULD MANAGE THEM I MEAN I SORT OF IN THE FEDERAL BUDGET WITH OTHER. GLOBALLY HOW DO YOU MANAGE THAT THE SKINNY MANAGED COME. THROUGH OUR WORK WITH THE FAA YES. THIS ISN'T WHERE WE ARE TODAY IN SPACES MUCH LIKE WHERE WE WERE IN AVIATION. LET'S SAY AROUND NINETEEN TWENTY NINETEEN THIRTY THERE'S A GREAT BOOK BY CHARLES LYNN BOOK ABOUT CHARLES WENT BEHIND HIM. AND RURAL LIMBURG ON NORTH TO THE ORIENT THAT TALKS ABOUT CHARLES LINDBERGH. NORTH TO THE ORIENT. WHICH IS A GREAT BOOK BECAUSE. IT'S WHILE THE LINDBERGH BABY WAS STILL ALIVE BUT IT'S A. WITH AMARO FLYING AS THE COMMUNICATIONS AND NAVIGATOR WITH CHARLES LINDBERGH AS HE FLIES FROM NEW YORK A TO THE ORIENT LOOKING FOR ROUTES FOR PAN AM. AVIATION IN THE NINETEEN. THIRTIES WAS IN A VERY PRIMITIVE STATE TODAY WITH AVIATION NOT ONLY ARE WE ABLE TO A FIELD. DON'T TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AIRCRAFT IN THE AIR SIMULTANEOUSLY WE'VE ALSO WORKED ON TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS THE SEPARATION OF AIRCRAFT TO GO FROM TWO THOUSAND FEET DOWN TO ONE THOUSAND WAS THE RACE TO. THE MOON AND SO FORTH. AND COMPETITION. AMONGST OTHER COUNTRIES. DO YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING ARE OPEN I MEAN ARE WE FAR AHEAD OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN THAT SENSES OF. SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS NOW BECOMING GLOBAL FUND. THAT DUMB YES COMPANIES LIKE PLANET LASSEN SKYBOX GOT THEIR START HERE IN SILICON VALLEY. BUT I'M WERE SEEN A INVESTMENT FUNDS IN THE UK IN EUROPE A IN ASIA ENTREPRENEURS. SEEN THE ADVANTAGE OF DEPLOYING THEIR ASSETS IN LOW EARTH ORBIT HOW WE MANAGE ALL THAT IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE A FOR THE. FOR THE FAA THERE CERTAINLY REQUIREMENTS ON THE HOOD DE ORBITING OF SATELLITES. OF AND YOU KNOW WITH RENTAL LOWERED ALTITUDE THEN THE SATELLITES NO NATURALLY DE ORBIT AS YOU GET HIGHER UP THAN THE LIFETIME FOR SATELLITE TO. SATELLITE INCREASES THERE ARE COMPANIES ON LIKE ASTRO SCALE WHICH IS PULLED IN I BELIEVE ABOUT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF FROM JAPANESE AND FROM JAPANESE IN SINGAPORE INVESTORS TO MANAGE THE SPACE DEBRIS PROBLEM. LEO LABS IS A COMPANY BASED HERE AND SILICON VALLEY OUT OF THE STANFORD RESEARCH INSTITUTE. WHICH IS TO PROVIDE NEXT GENERATION. A SITUATIONAL AWARENESS ON SPACE DEBRIS IN THE AND LOWER EARTH ORBIT YES THIS IS A CHALLENGING ISSUE AND WITH A COMPANY LIKE ONE WEB PLANNING TO DEPLOY NEARLY A THOUSAND SATELLITES AND THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE. IT'S GOING TO BE A MOM MORE OF AN ISSUE AT THE. AT THE FEDERAL AND GLOBAL LEVEL. THANK YOU SO. I'M AND IN WRAPPING THIS UP I WOULD SAY IS. THAT ENTREPRENEURS ARE FOCUS NOT JUST ON LOWER EARTH ORBIT AND WORK ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION BUT ALSO WITH A RETURN TO THE MOON THIS IS BOB RICHARDS FOR MODE EXPRESS. WHO I HAD AS OFFICE OUT IN NAM MOFFETT FIELD I SENSE MOVED ALSO? TO FLORIDA. AND. IT BOB IS ONE OF THE LEADERS IN WHAT WAS THE GOAL IN IRAQ'S PRICE. IN NOT DEPLOYING THEIR MISSION A TO THE MOTOR NAY EXPECT MANY OF THESE GROUPS WHETHER IT'S BOB OF FROM MOON EXPRESS. OF THE PART TIME SCIENTISTS OUT OF GERMANY TEAM INDICE ADDED INDIA SPACE AYE ELL ADDED ISRAEL WILL MAKE AN ATTEMPT ON IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE'VE ALSO. JUST THE OTHER DAY HAD THE. NASA LUNAR WORKSHOP WHERE NASA IS INTERESTED IN CONTRACTING WITH PRIVATE COMPANIES. TO DELIVER PAYLOADS. TO THE MOON OUR NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER IS VERY ACTIVE IN THE EAST. DEVELOPMENT OF PILLOWS WITH A BROAD SCIENCE COMMUNITY AND. THEY'RE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THIS ENTREPRENEURIAL THE WHAT ARE WITH ENTREPRENEURS LIKE MASTIN SPACE SYSTEMS WHICH IS DOWN A MOJAVE. IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF. MISSIONS OF. CAO FOR LUNAR ACTIVITY. IN CLOSING I WOULD SAY THAT. HERE IN THE UNITED STATES I'VE SEEN A WIDE VARIETY OF STATE. ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO SPACE SOME OF THEM ARE VERY ACTIVE LIKE GOV OF A SPACE FLORIDA WHICH WAS IN A POSITION WHAT'S A CANCEL THE SHUTTLE OF WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO. WITH IDEA ARE TOTALLY UNDER PLAYED A WORKFORCE BUT SPACE FLORIDA HAS REALLY BEEN A VERY INTERESTING MODEL FOR. ENGAGING AND LEADING A SPACE COMMUNITY THIS IS ALSO. TAKEN PLACE IN COLORADO COLORADO HAS A VERY NICELY WRITTEN REPORT ABOUT DATA WHAT THEIR ROAD. IS TOUGH FOR SPACE FOR THAT STATE A KENTUCKY SPACE HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE. LA I LIKE TO THINK OF RANKING OF STATES IN GDP FROM CALIFORNIA NUMBER ONE DOWN TO VERMONT NUMBER FIFTY RECENTLY I MET A COMPANY. FOUNDED IN VERMONT THAT WAS MEETING WITH THE GOVERNOR OF VERMONT TO. ENCOURAGED AND TO STAY IN THE STATE. KENTUCKY SPACES A GREAT EXAMPLE LED BY CHRIS CAMPBELL OF OF. OF HOW THEY'VE EMBRACED BOTH SMALL SATELLITES AND WORK ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION BOB TWIGS WHO IS THE FOUNDER OF CUBESATS HERE AT STANFORD ENDED UP AT MOORHEAD STATE UNIVERSITY. DOWN AND NON DOWN IN KENTUCKY NEW YORK SPACE ALLIANCE IS ALSO WORKING WITH CITY AND STATE OFFICIALS AND SPACE COM IS EVENT. OUT OF. OUT OF HOUSTON TEXAS HEARING CALIFORNIA WAS A VERY ACTIVE FOLLOWER WHILE I WAS ON THE SOVIET PROGRAM OF THE CALIFORNIA SPACE AUTHORITY. BUT I FEEL THAT THAT. THAT ORGANIZATION UP PERHAPS AND WAS PROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT TIME BECAUSE AT THAT TIME WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A GROWING SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. UP EFFORT I DO BELIEVE THAT A. ON THIS COMMISSION SHOULD PAY PROPER ATTENTION TO THE GROWING. SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP SECTOR WHICH IS UNIQUELY CALIFORNIA YOU MAY ASK WHY PEOPLE COME TO CALIFORNIA FOR START UPS AND YOU KNOW IT'S A SIMPLE ANSWER I FORGET WHO WAS YOU KNOW WHY HE ROBBED BANKS. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS AND SILICON VALLEY BUT SILICON VALLEY LEADS IF YOU'LL LOOK AT THE PRICE WATERHOUSE REPORT SILICON VALLEY CALIFORNIA LEADS. IN VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT BUT NOT FAR BEHIND OUR STATES LIKE HOME. OF MASSACHUSETTS TEXAS COLORADO. ENDA AND DAD NEW YORK TRISTATE DATA TRISTATE AREA SO WE CERTAINLY HAVE A LEAD IN THIS AND SILICON VALLEY IS. YOUR CONTINUES TO GAIN A GROWING PERCENTAGE OF FILE OF A MONIES FROM LIMITED PARTNERS BUT I FEEL THAT THIS COMMISSION. IS VERY IMPORTANT UP TO PROVIDE A JOINT VISION FOR THE STATE. YOU CAN LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE GLOBE WHETHER IT'S IN LUXEMBOURG OR SINGAPORE. ALL YOU SEE. A COUNTRIES ARE LOOKING TO BE ACTIVE PLAYERS IN SPACE I THINK IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO DECIDE WHAT SHOULD WE DO IS TODAY THE RIGHT TIME TO DO SOMETHING TOMORROW. BUT DATA IT CERTAINLY IS HARM A. A GROWING PHENOMENON. DATA WELL WE NEED TO KNOW AND PAY ATTENTION TO SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. S. M. QUESTION. IS THAT COMMISSION ACTIVE AND DO THEY MEET INDEED ARE YOU ABLE TO BE PARTICIPATE IN THAT AS THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEM I BILL. OF THE AEROSPACE COMMISSION OKAY SO. MISTER CASEY WAS ONE OF THE SUPPORTING WITNESSES AND WE WERE JUST IN FRONT OF THE THE SENATE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE. AND WE WERE AND IN FRONT OF YOUR COMMITTEE EARLIER IN THE. LAST YEAR. BUT. WE DO HAVE A. AS PART OF A TRYING TO ACHIEVE A. DIVERSE REPRESENTATION OF THE AEROSPACE AND AVIATION INDUSTRIES A. POSITION. DESIGNATED FOR. THE. AEROSPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. SUMMON THE IN THE AREA OF. THE INCUBATORS AND ACCELERATORS TO BE REPRESENTED ON AND AND I'D LIKE I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING MY AMENDMENT UP TO WHAT WAS AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS LEGISLATION. ALONG THOSE ALONG THOSE LINES SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU KNOW I I HAD TO STEP OUT TO. MEET WITH SIMS NOW CONSTITUENTS BUTTER. NAM. I'D LIKE TO ASK OF IT HASN'T BEEN ASKED ALREADY. WHAT? WHAT ARE THE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES AND OBSTACLES TO? THE VENTURE CAPITAL FINANCING MODEL. FOR AEROSPACE AS COMPARED TO OTHER HIGH TECH INDUSTRY. I THINK. THERE'S A CHANCE THEY'RE CERTAINLY CHALLENGES FOR A SMALL BUSINESS AND AS I'VE PULLED. SOME OF THE. THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS ALL I CAN REALLY REPORT ON IS WHAT I WOULD TERM AS AN ANECDOTAL. A DATA. THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME GLOBAL ISSUES THAT EVERYONE FEELS HEARING CALIFORNIA ON. TURNED HOUSING COSTS AND. AND TAXATION AND CORPORATE TAXES ARE CERTAINLY HR A ISSUES HR LAWS. BETTER. THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR. WORKPLACE AND TREATMENT OF CONTRACTORS. AND RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO RULES AND REGULATIONS SUCH AS SUPPLY TO THE SMALL BUSINESSES I FEEL. THAT. THOSE MAYBE THINGS THAT JUST APPLY ACROSS THE BOARD ON THIS END IF WERE FOCUSED SOLELY ON LARGE AEROSPACE COMPANIES WE MAY NOT APPRECIATE THE COSTS. OF THOSE REGULATIONS ON SMALLER RUSSIA SMALLER COMPANIES. I BELIEVE I'M A STILL WORKING WITH THE VENTURE CAPITAL INDUSTRY THEY WERE VERY INTERESTED. IN. IN THIS BILL AND THE LEGISLATION WE HAD WE REACHED OUT TO ABOUT A HUNDRED A DIFFERENT VENTURE FUNDS AND HAD THEIR FEEDBACK AND I THINK THERE BEALL WILLING TO. CONTRIBUTE SO OF IF YOU'D LIKE I CAN. HAD. A MODEST AMOUNT OF TIME IN RESPONDING TO. THE LEGISLATION AND. I'M BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS FOR THINGS IN SPECIFIC THAT PEOPLE LIKE RIGHT NOW ALL I HAVE PURCHASED ANECDOTAL. COMMENTS FROM INDIVIDUALS WHICH I DON'T AS A SCIENTIST I DON'T FEEL THAT THAT'S. PARTICULARLY HELPFUL I FEEL THAT THIS COMMISSION CAN COME UP WITH A SYSTEMATIC UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE WE ARE. A AS AN INDUSTRY AND WHAT VARIOUS GROUPS ARE ARE ARE LOOKING FOR OKAY. A AYE AND PERHAPS I. CAN STAY MY QUESTION NO. A BETTER BUT. YOU KNOW AND UNTIL RECENTLY WHEN I WHEN I STARTED MEETING WITH AEROSPACE A. ACCELERATORS IN IN INCUBATORS. MY. EXPERIENCE HAD BEEN LIMITED TO IN TERMS OF VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY WITH SILICON VALLEY YOU KNOW. COMPUTER SOFTWARE HARDWARE. INTERNET RELATED TO. ACTIVITIES AND SO I WASN'T AS FAMILIAR WITH. THE US. THIS KIND OF ENTREPRENEURIAL MODEL. TAKING PLACE IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY AND AND DIE I THINK I TOLD YOU. THAT IF IT WAS A. REFRESHING. CHANGE FOR ME BECAUSE MY PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH. ESPECIALLY WITH THE MAJOR AEROSPACE COMPANIES THAT THEY'D THEY TEND TO BE. YOU KNOW RELY HEAVILY ON THE DEFENSE CONTRACTS AND AND. YOU THEY'RE MUCH MORE. YOU KNOW FOCUSED ON. INTERVIEW THE THEY THEY TEND TO BE MUCH MORE CONSERVATIVE IN TERMS OF. OF. YOU KNOW. MAKING SURE THAT THERE STRENGTHENING THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE IN A LOT OF FORMER MILITARY OFFICERS WHO HAD WORKED IN THE PENTAGON TO HELP THEM. YOU KNOW. BY. YOU KNOW CONTINUE THAT THAT PIPELINE OF FINANCING THAT HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT'S IT'S SO TO SEE. AEROSPACE COMPANIES TALKING ABOUT ANGEL INVESTORS AND AND. AND AND SEED CAPITAL AND YOU KNOW. IT'S. I THINK THERE'RE YOUNG IT AT ME THERE ARE A TO AFFECTS ONE OF WHICH. THAT I MENTIONED IS THAT UP VENTURE CAPITAL RULES DO NOT CHANGED I WAS AT SOME OF BAD THEY SAID OH WELL WE THINK VENTURE CAPITALISTS ARE RELAXING THERE ARE. Y. REQUIREMENTS FOR. YOU KNOW SPACES LIKE THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE THE. DUE DILIGENCE THAT A COMPANY HAS TO PASS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE COMPANY OR SOCIAL NETWORKING COMPANY HERE. ANY OTHER OUT YOU KNOW AND AG COMPANY IS EXACTLY THE SAME FOR. TOUGH FOR SPACE AS IT WOULD BE FOR A LITTLE ANY OTHER ANY OTHER COMPANY ON THIS YEAH INVESTORS. IF YOU'RE RUNNING A FIRM BICU SAY THIS IS THE AREA THAT I'M GOING AFTER YOU SELL THAT AREA TO YOUR. YOU KNOW THIS INDUSTRY THERE'S VERTICAL YOU SELL THAT TO YOUR LIMITED PARTNERS IN LIMITED PARTNERS HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF OPPORTUNITIES TO PICK FROM WHETHER IT'S TODAY. A AYE A SLEEPER ISSUE MIGHT BE QUANTUM COMPUTING. HOME ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING. SO WELL IT'S NOT THAT VENTURE CAPITALISTS ARE RELAXING THEIR REQUIREMENTS. WHAT'S ALSO BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT. SPACE COMPANIES EARLY STAGE HER OUT IN A MERE MORTAL COMPANIES HAVE NOW ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE RETIREMENT OF RISK WITH. INVESTMENT NUMBERS THAT MATCH WHAT A TYPICAL ANGEL VENTURE CAPITAL COMMUNITY IS ABLE TO DO. LAUNCH COMPANIES ARE PARTICULARLY PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU NEED A LARGE INVESTMENT OF CAPITAL ON MR MOSK IS IN A VERY PRIVILEGED POSITION BEING A FOUNDER OF PAYPAL. ALSO HAD BEEN. YOU KNOW THE ABILITY TO DO WHAT I WOULD CALL A THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FRIENDS AND FAMILY AROUND. A WITH HIS OTHER COFOUNDERS PETER THIEL OTHERS SET UP AND SO WHAT MUSK IS ABLE TO DO OR SAY. RICHARD BRANSON WHEN HE GOES TO THE ABU DHABI'S SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND THOSE A UNIQUE EXAMPLES. BUT. THE FACT THAT PETER PLOTS HER. WITH SPIRE WAS ABLE TO RAISE A MILLION DOLLARS ON IS RG SET CONCEPT AND THEN PIVOT. TO WORK ON. GPS OCCULTATION MEASUREMENTS AND I MY MIND BE THE FIRST ONE TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU COULD USE SMALL SATELLITES TO MEASURE GPS SIGNALS IN LOW EARTH ORBIT. AND PETER HAS SUCCESSFULLY GROWN A SPIRE TEMPLE IN WHAT WAS SEVENTY MILLIONS WORTH SEVENTY MILLION WITH A DOLLARS DEPLOY A CONSOLATION. IN LOWER EARTH ORBIT AND NOW WAS PULLED IN ANOTHER SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS COME FROM LUXEMBOURG A OR TO ESTABLISH A. YOU KNOW AN OFFICER AND OFFICE OUT THERE. SO. THE MODEL FOR SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP HAS MATCHED THE MODEL THAT WE'VE SEEN FOR OTHER SILICON VALLEY. START UPS BECAUSE OF LOW COST THE TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE OF LAUNCH OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED BY SPACEX IN VIRGINIA ANOTHER. ALRIGHT. FOR THE QUESTIONS NOW. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FIGURE MUCH. NARRATOR AND PERHAPS IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. WE'D LIKE TO INVITE TO. ALL THREE. OF. COULD DISPENSED FROM THE NEXT PANEL TO TALK ABOUT TO. INFRASTRUCTURE AND A LOOK IN OTHER STATES AND THEIR EXPERIENCE. WOULD LIKE TO INVITE UP CORINA ADRESE THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE MOJAVE AIR AND SPACE PORT. DAN GAVE THE END THAT I GALLON THE PROGRAM MANAGER OF THE HARRIS CORPORATION SPACEPORT SYSTEMS. AND SHERMAN COUNCIL AEROSPACE ENGINEER UP FOR THE OFFICE OF COMMERCIAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION. BUT THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION. WELCOME EVERYONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELP US. THE TABLE IS BIG ENOUGH. WE'LL START WITH THE. MYSTERIES FROM THE MOJAVE AIR AND SPACE PORT. EXCELLENT. GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIRMAN. GOOD MORNING ASSUMING LACKEY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY A I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. AFTER PROVIDING A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE HOT AIR AND SPACE FOR LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES I THINK CALIFORNIA HAS IN THIS INDUSTRY. SO VERY BRIEFLY WE ARE A GENERAL AVIATION AIRPORT AND SPACEPORT WERE LOCATED ONE HUNDRED MILES DIRECTLY NORTH OF LOS ANGELES IN THE DESERT. WE ARE A SPECIAL DISTRICT AIRPORT IN WE ARE COMPLETELY SELF CONTAINED WITH OPERATING REVENUES WE GENERATE FROM OUR CUSTOMERS. MY HOBBY IS AN IDEAL PLACE FOR THE COMMERCIAL SPACE INDUSTRY. THERE ARE FEW PLACES IN THE COUNTRY THAT PROVIDE THIS ONE STOP SHOP FOR AIR CARRIER OPERATIONS WHERE THEY CAN DESIGN MANUFACTURE TEST. FLIGHT TEST ROCKET TEST AND OPERATE ALL IN ONE PLACE. WE HAVE THE REMOTE LOCATION IDEAL CLIMATE AND RESTRICTED AIRSPACE NECESSARY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS TO TEST AN OPERATE SAFELY. IN ADDITION TO THE TRADITIONAL AEROSPACE COMPANIES SUCH AS NORTHRUP GRUMMOND BE EIGHTY SYSTEMS AND SCALED COMPOSITES THAT ALL CALL MOJAVE HOME. TODAY OUR NEW SPACE CUSTOMERS INCLUDE VIRGIN GALACTIC THIS BISHOP COMPANY VIRGIN ORBIT STRATA LAUNCH AND MASTON SPACE SYSTEMS. THESE ARE CUSTOMERS CURRENTLY PAYING RENT IN MOJAVE. NOT BECAUSE THEY RECEIVED AN INCENTIVE BUT BECAUSE THAT IS THE IDEAL PLACE FOR THEM TO OPERATE. BECAUSE WILL GIVE SUCH A GREAT. O. OVERVIEW OF A VIRGIN I WON'T GO INTO ANY OF THE DETAILS THE ONLY THING I WILL ADD TO THAT IS THE FACT THAT ALL THREE MERGING COMPANIES ARE ARE. CURRENTLY TENANTS OF MODERN SPACE PORT. SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL DIDN'T DIDN'T. QUITE TOUCH ON WAS THE FACT THAT VIRGIN GALACTIC HAS A LONG STANDING AGREEMENT WITH THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO. NEW MEXICO BILL THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR CUSTOM BUILT FACILITY FOR VIRGIN GALACTIC. WHICH STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX I BELIEVE TOOK FIVE YEARS TO COMPLETE. SO EVEN THOUGH VIRGIN GALACTIC WILL BE MOVING TO NEW MEXICO THIS BISHOP COMPANY WILL REMAIN IN MOJAVE AND ROOTED IN MOJAVE. STRUGGLE LAUNCH IS A COMPANY FOUNDED BY PAUL ALLEN WHO IS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF MICROSOFT WHICH IS OF BUILDING THE WORLD'S LARGEST AIRPLANE IN MOJAVE. IT WILL BE CAPABLE OF LAUNCHING VERY LARGE PAYLOADS INTO SPACE. THE STRUGGLE WATCH AIRCRAFT IS MANUFACTURED BY SKILLED COMPOSITES WHICH IS ANOTHER COMPANY WITH ROOTS IN MOJAVE. AND THEY INTENDED TO CONDUCT SPACE LAUNCHES FROM HOBBY AS WELL. SO REALLY WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON A MOJAVE IS PROVIDING AIRPORT STYLE OPERATIONS FOR THE COMMERCIAL SPACE COMPANIES THE ONES THAT ARE USING AIR LAUNCH METHOD TO OUR TO LAUNCH ROCKETS. AND THEN JUST QUICKLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. OH THERE IS RENEWED INTEREST IN SPACE WOULD THEN NOT CONGRESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION SO WE WE ARE PAID A VISIT BY VICE PRESIDENT PENCE BACK IN OCTOBER. HE TOURED THE AT THE AIRPORT HE TOURED VIRGIN AND HE TORTURED ARCHES WHILE. I THINK IS A PERSONAL INTEREST IN THE PERSONAL SPACE INDUSTRY. WE ARE ALSO IN CONGRESSMAN KEVIN MCCARTHY IS DISTRICTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE DO GET A LOT OF GREAT ATTENTION. WITHIN THE SPACE INDUSTRY. AT ALL JUST ALSO MENTION THAT ASSEMBLYMAN LIKE IT'S BEEN A WONDERFUL SUPPORTER OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IN MOJAVE AND. FOR COMPANIES AS WELL. SO FEDERALLY THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS TAKING PLACE REGARDING INTEGRATION INTO THE NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM. BETTER CLASSIFICATION FOR SPACE PORTS AND PROMOTING A BETTER REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. NATIONWIDE THERE ARE TEN LICENSE SPACE PORTS WHICH I MENTION TERMINAL TOUCH ON HERE IN A LITTLE WHILE. EACH WITH DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES AND EACH WITH VARIOUS STATE SUPPORT. STATES ARE VERY EAGER TO EARN THE BUSINESS AND THEY OFFER INCENTIVES TO OPERATORS. IT IS BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT FOR MAHAVIR SPACEPORT TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AS THE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO GROW. WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES AND MORE FAVORABLE LEGISLATION IN GENERAL. I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER SITES BUT OF THIS. FOR THAT ONE. SO AND THE FAA DOES NOT TREAT LICENSE SPACE PORTS THE WAY THEY DO AIRPORTS CONGRESS HAS NOT ALLOCATED A BUDGET. FOR THE FAA TO OFFER GRANTS TO SPACE PORTS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. SO INDIVIDUAL STATES ARE TAKING THIS ON DIRECTLY. IF CALIFORNIA WERE TO OFFER AN INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM THROUGH CALTRANS. YOU HAVE TWO CUSTOMER HERE TODAY. WHO CAN QUICKLY PROVE RETURN ON THE STATE'S INVESTMENT? WE HAVE BEEN NEED TODAY TO SUPPORT OUR CURRENT CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AS WELL AS RETAIN THE SPACE START UPS IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS WE HAVE A NEED TO EXPAND TO SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMER GROWTH. TO ACCOMPANY PUTTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO VEHICLE PRODUCTION AND TESTING. RECEIVING ANOFFER OF A FREE FACILITY IN ANOTHER STATE IS THAT IS AN OFFER THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO REFUSE. I'M NOT HERE TO ASK THE STATE TO BUILD HANGARS IN MOJAVE IT WERE OFFERED. I WANT THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS TO UNDERSAND THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE WHICH ARE SIMPLE LEGISLATIVE CORRECTIONS THAT WILL ENABLE ME TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER STATES. FIRST I NEED TO BE ABLE TO BORROW MONEY JUST AS ANY OTHER ENTITY CAN BORROW MONEY. WITHOUT THE RESTRICTION OF P. UC TWO TWO FIVE FIVE SEVEN. WHICH LIMITS MY BORROWING TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW AIRPORTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONSISTENTLY OPERATING IN THE BLACK. OUR ABILITY TO BORROW MONEY SHOULD BE BASED ONLY ON OUR CREDIT WORTHINESS AND NOT WHETHER WE ARE AN AIRPORT DISTRICT. SECOND BECAUSE WE'RE A PUBLIC AGENCY WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY PREVAILING WAGES FOR ANY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT CHOOSE THE THIRTY FIVE PERCENT PREMIUM. OVER MARKET RATE. WE WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN DISCUSSIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY IN STAFF ABOUT HOW THE COMMERCIAL SPACE INDUSTRY MIGHT BENEFIT FROM REDUCING CONSTRUCTION COSTS. LOWERING THE COST AND ALLOWING ME TO BORROW MONEY WILL ENABLE ME TO GROW. I HAVE FIVE EXISTING CUSTOMERS WHO WOULD LEASE A NEW HANGAR TODAY IF IT WERE AVAILABLE. NOT TO MENTION THE NUMEROUS COMPANIES I HAVE TO TURN AWAY DUE TO LACK OF SPACE. THIS PROCESS HAS BECOME QUITE FRUSTRATING FOR MOJAVE. WELL OTHER STATES ARE OFFERING BRAND NEW FACILITIES TO MY CURRENT CUSTOMERS FREE. I CAN YOU TAKE OUT A LOAN TO HELP THEM EXPAND IN CALIFORNIA. SEVERAL STATES ARE AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING MY EXISTING CUSTOMERS. SINCE I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE MAHABIR SPACE PORT HAS HOSTED SPACEPORT TEAMS FROM TEXAS NEW MEXICO COLORADO HAWAII AND FLORIDA. THE DOMESTIC INTERESTS HOWEVER IS ONLY A FRACTION. OF THE INTEREST WE SEE IN MOJAVE. WE HAVE ALSO HOSTED SEVERAL PROSPECTIVE SPACE PORT TEAMS FROM THE UK. ITALY FRANCE AUSTRALIA SWEDEN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA. PEOPLE LIKE ME. WHO BELIEVE THIS INDUSTRY WILL CHANGE THE WORLD? WILL FOLLOW THIS INDUSTRY ANYWHERE IF THAT MEANS I CAN PROVIDE SOME SMALL AMOUNT OF SUPPORT TO WATCH IT SUCCEED. BUT I'M ADVOCATE FOR MOJAVE. BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE CALIFORNIA SUCCEED AT I WANT TO SEE THE COMMERCIAL SPACE COMPANIES SUCCEED AND MY HOBBY REALLY IS AN IDEAL PLACE FOR THEM TO OPERATE. MY HOBBY IS WORTHY OF INVESTMENT BY THE STATE AND I DO A BILL CONSIDER SUPPORTING SOME KIND OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM TO HELP RETAIN AND GROW THE BUSINESS WE ALREADY HAVE AND ENABLE US TO FOSTER NEW COMPANY GROWTH. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON THE INDUSTRY ARE CHALLENGES AND I WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. BUT WHAT ARE WE UP. TO HERE FROM ALL THE SPEAKERS AND THEN. WILL OPEN UP FOR HI GOOD MORNING MORNING I THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARTUCCI FOR. THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE SUBCOMMITTEE TODAY THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY UP FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION AS WELL ON THAT PARTICULAR TIME TO HOLD THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATIONAL HEARING. TODAY I'M HERE REPRESENTING HARRIS CORPORATION AND SPECIFICALLY THE CALIFORNIA SPACE PORT. HARRIS CORPORATION THE LEADING TECHNOLOGY INNOVATOR SOLVING CUSTOMERS TOUGHEST MISSION CRITICAL CHALLENGES PART PROVIDING SOLUTIONS THAT CONNECT INFORMED PROTECT. HARRIS EMPLOYS MORE THAN SEVENTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES INCLUDING OVER SEVEN THOUSAND SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS ARE ANNUAL REVENUES ABOUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. MY TEAM REPORTS THROUGH THE SPACE AN INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS SEGMENT OF PARIS. WHICH PROVIDES THE WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED SENSORS AND PAYLOADS GROUND PROCESSING SYSTEMS AND ADVANCED PRODUCTS IN ANALYTICS FOR GLOBAL SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. SPACE SITUATION WHEREIN AWARENESS AND EARTH OBSERVATION. I HARRIS IS HEADQUARTERED IN FLORIDA. HOWEVER WE HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES AND MANY CUSTOMERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE MANAGE AND OPERATE IN CAL WE WE MANAGE OPERATION IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS VITAL TO THE STATE'S FUTURE GROWTH AND COMMERCIAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION AND THAT IS THE CALIFORNIA SPACE PORT. AT VANDENBERG AIRFORCE BASE. HARRIS IS CALIFORNIA SPACE PORT IS A COMMERCIALLY OPERATED SPACE LAUNCH COMPLEX USING LEASED PROPERTY ON VANDENBERG AIRFORCE BASE. THE SPACEPORT CONSISTS OF A SATELLITE PROCESSING AND INTEGRATION FACILITY AND A SMALL LAUNCH PAD. A WE WERE THE FIRST FAA LICENSED PRIVATE COMMERCIAL SPACE LAUNCH SITE OPERATOR IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE CURRENTLY HOLD THE ONLY. FAA COMMERCIAL SPACEPORT LICENSING CALIFORNIA WITH THE AUTHORITY TO LAUNCH SATELLITES. INTO ORBIT. OUR LOCATIONS ON THE CENTRAL COAST OF CALIFORNIA UNIQUELY SITUATED. AT THE POINT WHERE THE NORTH SOUTH BEACH'S BEGIN TO TURN EAST WEST I THIS DEEMS THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE SPACEPORT AT VANDERBURGH IDEAL FOR LAUNCHING INTO POLAR OR SUN SYNCHRONOUS ORBITS. A POLAR ORBITER IMPORTANT BECAUSE AT THE SATELLITE ORBITS AT A LOW ALTITUDE FROM POLE TO POLE. THE EARTH ROTATES BLOW IT. SO OVER THE COURSE OF EACH DAY THE SATELLITE WILL PASSED OVER THE ENTIRE PLANET. THESE ORBITS ARE IDEAL FOR EARTH MONITORING MISSIONS LIKE WEATHER SATELLITES LAND MONITORING EARTH IMAGING. MAPPING APPLICATIONS I WE ARE THE ONLY LOCATION IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES THE PERMITS SOUTHERN TRAJECTORY LAUNCHES. FROM CALIFORNIA TOWARD TO SOUTH POLE WITHOUT OVERFLIGHT OF ANY POPULATED AREAS. THE HARRIS SPACE PORT FACILITY COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. AND WAS OFFICIALLY DEBT OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED A SPACE LAUNCH COMPLEX EIGHT KNOWN IN THE COMMUNITY AS SLICK EIGHT. IT WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A LOW COST ALTERNATIVE FOR BOTH COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT LAUNCH VEHICLE PROVIDERS INTERESTED IN USING SMALLER ROCKETS. TO LAUNCH SMALLER SATELLITES INTO SPACE. I THOUGHT IT WAS FINANCED USING PRIVATE INVESTMENT DOLLARS WITH SOME GRANT FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL AND CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENTS. AND WAS DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE A LARGE VARIETY OF SMALLER CLASS LAUNCH VEHICLES. HOWEVER SINCE ITS INCEPTION THE SPACEPORT HAS ONLY SUPPORTED NINE LAUNCHES. OUR THIS MODEST USED IS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTED ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LACK OF DEMAND. AND LACK OF A BILL AVAILABILITY FOR SMALL SATELLITE LAUNCH CAPABILITY BUT DEMAND IS CHANGING RAPIDLY. NOT SO SIMILAR TO THE AYE PREVIOUS. PRESENTER I'M TALKING ABOUT THE VENTURE CAPITALISTS SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE SPACE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED A RISING DEMAND FOR SMALL SATELLITES. OF THIS A FROM REFRIGERATOR SIZED DOWN TO SHOEBOX SIZED AND SMALLER. A SMALL SATELLITES ARE SMALL SATS ARE CHANGING THE COMMERCIAL SPACE INDUSTRY. SMALL SATS ALSO REFERRED TO AS NANO SATIN CUBESATS CAN BE BUILT ENTIRELY WITH COMMERCIAL OFF THE SHELF COMPONENTS AND THEIR DECREASE DEVELOPMENT COSTS MAKE SPACE EXPLOITATION ACCESSIBLE TO MUCH SMALLER COMPANIES AND STUDENTS AT MOST. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. TODAY ONE OF THE LARGEST BARRIERS THAT SMALL SACK COMPANY SPACE IS THE COST OF ROCKET LAUNCHERS. LAUNCH SERVICE CONTRACT PRICES ARE DROPPING WITH INCREASED COMPETITION AND SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATIONS OF REUSABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE SPACEX'S DEMONSTRATED. A HOWEVER FOR SMALL SAT THE ONLY WAY TO SPACE TODAY AT THE HITCH A RIDE. WITH A LARGER SATELLITE LAUNCH LEAVING THE SMALL SAT AT THE MERCY OF THE PRIMARY MISSION AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO CONTROL ITS OWN DESTINY. IN TERMS OF SCHEDULE OR FINAL ORBIT. DESTINATION. IN ORDER FOR SMALL SETS TO DICTATE THEIR SPECIFIC OR BILL REQUIREMENTS THEY MUST BE ABLE TO HIRE A DEDICATED LAUNCH SERVICE. NOT TO OVERCOME THIS BARRIER SEVERAL NEW COMPANIES ARE BEGINNING TO COMPETE FOR THIS GROWING DEDICATED SMALL SAT LAUNCH MARKET. I THIS IS THE NEXT BIG STEP TO COMMERCIAL ACCESS TO SPACE DEDICATED SMALL SAT LAUNCHERS. THE NEW ROCKETS TRYING TO CAPTURE THIS MARKET ARE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER THAN THE MORE TRADITIONAL ROCKETS OF TODAY AND THE PAST. HOW TO PROPERLY SERVICE THIS MARKET COMPANIES MUST INCLUDE THE CAPABILITY FOR LAUNCHING INTO POLAR ORBITS BECAUSE MANY THE SMALL SET MISSIONS? I INVOLVE EARTH SENSING PAY VOTES. SEVERAL THESE NEW ROCKET COMPANIES ARE CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANIES SUCH AS ROCKET LAB HEADQUARTERED IN HUNTINGTON BEACH. AND MANY HAVE LARGE ENGINEERING OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING VECTOR IN ORANGE COUNTY AND ASTRA SPACE IN ALAMEDA. INTERESTINGLY THOUGH THESE COMPANIES THESE CALIFORNIA COMPANIES BETTER CHASING THIS EMERGING DEDICATED SMALL SAT LAUNCH MARKET ARE TAKING THEIR INITIAL LAUNCH OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ROCKET LAB BUILT THEIR OWN LAUNCH COMPLEX IN NEW ZEALAND. AND THE OTHERS ARE COMPLETING THEIR FIRST WATCHES FROM KODIAK ALASKA. THE ONLY OTHER FAA LICENSED LOCATION IN THE UNITED STATES THAT'S AUTHORIZED FOR POLAR LAUNCH OPERATIONS. ARE THESE DISTANCE LAUNCH SITES CREATE SIGNIFICANT LOGISTICS ISSUES AND DRIVE DEVELOPMENT COSTS. SO WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES WHY ARE THESE COMPANIES INCLINED TO LAUNCH OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO GROW THIS INDUSTRY IN OUR STATE. OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST WE BELIEVE. THE CALIFORNIA COMMERCIAL SPACEPORT SHOULD BE THE FIRST CHOICE LAUNCH LOCATION FOR ALL THESE COMPANIES. BOB SPACEPORT HAS SOME DEFICIENCIES IN CHALLENGERS. A THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE CALIFORNIA SPACE PORT IS LACKING. THE NEEDS FOR ROCKETS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS AND MOST OF THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IS NO LONGER NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THESE NEW ROCKET CONCEPTS. THESE COMPANIES NEED CONCRETE PADS BASIC LIQUID ROCKET ENGINE FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE MODULAR STORAGE ASSEMBLY BUILDINGS. AT AS KARINA MENTION THE STATE OF FLORIDA VIRGINIA ALASKA THEY PROVIDE MUCH OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE OUT THERE SPACE PORTS. ARE OR THEY PROVIDE MATCHING STATE GRANTS FOR PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. SECOND THE REGULATORY HURDLES FOR LAUNCHING A NEW TYPE OF ROCKET ON A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RANGE ARE DAUNTING. EACH COMPANY HAS TO COORDINATE OVERLAPPING REQUIREMENTS OF TO FEDERAL AGENCIES THE FAA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. THE REGULATIONS OF THESE FEDERAL AGENCIES WERE DESIGNED AROUND PUBLIC SAFETY SOMETHING HARRIS TAKES VERY SERIOUSLY. BUT THESE REGULATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED WITH MEDIUM TO LARGE CLASS ROCKETS IN MIND. HOLDING SMALL SAT LAUNCH VEHICLES TO THE SAME STANDARDS AS LARGER ROCKETS IS TIME AND COST PROHIBITIVE. AND OFTEN RESULT IN UNNECESSARY EFFORTS TO PROVE OR DEMONSTRATE THE NON APPLICABILITY OF THE EXISTING REGULATIONS. ADDITIONALLY THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING CAN BE TIME CONSUMING AND CUMBERSOME PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE VITAL LANCE WE LEASE FROM THE AIRFORCE IS A RESPONSIBILITY WE YET HARRIS. TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY. WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN APPROVED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FOR SPACE PORT THAT RESULTED IN A FINDING OF NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OR FONZIE WITH THE EXPECTATION WE WOULD BE LAUNCHING LARGER. SOLID ROCKET BASED LAUNCH VEHICLES. BUT THE ADDITION OF NEW SMALLER CLEANER ROCKETS TO OUR OPERATIONS SHOULD NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. AND FINALLY. THE HIGH COST OF OPERATING CALIFORNIA FROM COSTA LIVING TO ENERGY COSTS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO COMMERCIAL SPACE LAUNCH INDUSTRY. AS EVERYONE OPERATING AT VANDERBURGH CAN ATTEST THE AGING UTILITY SERVICES SPECIAL ELECTRICITY ARE EXPENSIVE TO USERS BUT ALSO PROVIDE AN UNACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF RELIABILITY. THE NUMBER OF UNPLANNED POWER OUTAGES ARE GLITCHES EACH YEAR IS SIGNIFICANT. DRIVING INDUSTRY TO LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVE POWER SOURCES AND ENGINEER REDUNDANT SYSTEMS TO PROTECT THEIR GROUND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT IN FLIGHT HARDWARE. FROM THE EXISTING EROTIC POWER INFRASTRUCTURE. BACK UP GENERATORS BECOME A NECESSITY IN THE NORM. AND THESE COME WITH THEIR OWN SET OF PROBLEMS INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING. I WE AT HARRIS ARE HONORED TO OPERATE CALIFORNIA SPACEPORT AND ARE COMMITTED TO SEEING THIS COMMERCIAL SPACEPORT FLOURISH OVER THE NEXT DECADE. WE ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS OR SPACEPORT GRANTS TO ATTRACT NEW BUSINESS TO CALIFORNIA. WE ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO REVIEW EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL RICK REGULATIONS FOR STREAMLINING WHEREVER WHEREVER FEASIBLE. AND MAYBE CONSIDERING ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE WITHIN CALTRANS TO COORDINATE COMMERCIAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION ACTIVITIES TO CONSOLIDATE AND SYNCHRONIZE THE COORDINATES COORDINATION WITH THE COGS IN FEDERAL AGENCIES. AND FINALLY AS WE KNOW YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW STEM EDUCATION INCENTIVES CONSIDER NEW FUNDING FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL KEEPS AT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS POSSIBLY MODELED AFTER THE PROGRAM INITIATED SEVERAL IRVINE AREA HIGH SCHOOLS. I WE SEE THIS EMERGING COMMERCIAL SMALL SIDE ENTERPRISE AS A GROWTH MARKET FOR CALIFORNIA. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN THE STATE IN ADDITION TO OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA SPACEPORT BECOMES THE GO TO OPERATIONAL LAUNCH LOCATION. FOR DEDICATED SMALL SAT LAUNCHES IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU I VERY MUCH TESTING. BACK TO TOP THERE HAS TO. AS A GET TOGETHER PUBLIC. I GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS SHERMAN COUNCIL AND. I'M WITH THE OFFICE OF A COMMERCIAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION. STAY LIKE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE INTRODUCTION A. S. T.. FIRST LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TODAY AND SHARING WHAT WE DO IN A CITY. THIS MIGHT BE THE SECOND TIME YOU SEEN HIS PRESENTATION SO OUT. OF WORKING THAT IN MIND. SECOND I THINK IT'S FITTING THAT. PRESENT AT THE END BECAUSE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANIES WE TALKED ABOUT ARRAY TODAY. HAS APPLY FOR SOME AUTHORIZATION TO OUR OFFICE. IT IN PARTICULAR EVA TALKED ABOUT SPACEX. WILL TALKED ABOUT VIRGIN CREATES TOUGH ABOUT MY HOBBY AND DAN TOOK A COUPLE SPACE PORT. SOLVE DIFFERENT CITIES HAVE COME TO OUR OFFICE FOR THE VARIOUS. AUTHORIZATIONS. OKAY SO OUR STATUTORY AUTHORITY RESIDES ON THE DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION. OUR IS AUTHORIZES THE FAA TO LICENSE COMMERCIAL LAUNCH AND ENTRY ACTIVITIES. THAT THE OPERATION OF LAUNCH AND REENTRY SITES. FAA SERVER TO TO. EXERCISE IF POSSIBILITY. WITH PUBLIC SAFETY. A SAFE YOUR PROPERTY NATIONAL SECURITY. FOREIGN POLICY INTERESTS OF UNITED STATES. WE ALSO HAVE A UNIQUE. DIRECTION TO ENCOURAGE FACILITATE PROMOTE. DOT TYPICALLY MEANS IN OUR PRE AT PROCESS SEES WE OFTEN TIMES. ASSIST THE APPLICANT WITH VARIOUS THINGS THAT THAT MAY BECOME ISSUE TO THE PROM BY SITTING PROCESS. AND THE LAST BULLET IS REALLY STATE THAT. WE. DO NOT AUTHORIZE. LAUNCH THAT ARE FORMED BY THAT THE GOVERNMENT. ESSENTIALLY. OKAY AS FAR AS A LICENSING PROCESS. THIS IS A QUICK BREAKDOWN OF OF WHAT IT IS. I A ENTITY MUST OBTAIN A LICENSE TO LAUNCH. LAUNCH VEHICLE FROM THE U. S.. TO OPERATE IN THE ON SITE WITH IN THE U. S. AND TO RE ENTER A VEHICLE. AND UNITED STATES AND TO OPERATE A RE ENTRY SITE. WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. ALSO YOU US CITIZENS OR ENTITY ORGANIZED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY STATE MUST OBTAIN A LICENSE. TO LAUNCH A LAUNCH VEHICLE OUTSIDE THE U. S.. TO OPERATED LAUNCH SITE OUTSIDE THE US AND TO RE ENTER A REENTRY VEHICLE OUTSIDE THE U. S.. AND TOO ARE PRETTY NOT PAY REENTRY SITE. OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IN EXTRA. THE IN TWO THOUSAND ONE I CAME ON BOARD TO A IS T. WE ONLY HAD THIRTY FIVE STAFF MEMBERS TOTAL. RIGHT NOW IS ABOUT A THIRD OF WHAT WE HAVE NOW. TODAY WE HAVE NINETY EIGHT FULL TIME FEDERAL EMPLOYEES IN THE SEA. MOSTLY IN DC WE HAVE FIELD OFFICES IN FLORIDA TEXAS AND OF COURSE CALIFORNIA'S WHEN I'M BASED. A BEEN HERE ABOUT FIVE YEARS NOW. AND THE REASON WHY WE SENT PEOPLE FROM DC TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE THE LINGERIE AND ACTIVITIES PICKING UP ARE QUITE QUITE FAST. STORES ARE BUDGET IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FISCAL YEAR A WE HAVE NINETEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION. ON THE BOOKS. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN RESEARCH THE BUDGET WE HAVE TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. OUR OWN THE BOOKS FOR. THE BUDGET FOR TWO OF NINETEEN. GUESS A COMPARISON TO THE REST OF THE FAA WE ARE A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF BUSINESS BUT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF WORK IN TERMS OF THE SPACE OPERATIONS THAT ARE CONCURRENT OCCURRING O. POLLUTED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. AS FOLLOWS A LIKE SEEING HOW BREAKS DOWN THERE ARE THREE MAJOR PHASES IN LICENSING PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES. THE FREE APPLICATION CONSULTATION. LICENSING EVALUATION. APPLICATION ACCEPTANCE AND THEN LAUNCH OPERATIONS. THE VERY TOP ERA THERE IS TO THREE ITEMS SPEAKING. AND. SO I WAS GONNA GO TO THE QUESTION THAT CAME UP EARLIER FROM. THE MEMBER I THINK SHARON AND ASKED ABOUT THE PROCESS FOR WHAT HOW WE INCORPORATE LAUNCHES INTO NAZ. THEY ARE DOZEN AGREEMENT THAT'S REQUIRED BY THE APPLICANT TO. COULD GET HAVE FOR. THE IMPACT TO THE LAST WHICH IS A LOW A LOT OF AGREEMENT. AND A TF ARE IT'S TYPICALLY ISSUE. TO SENATE SANTOS AEROSPACE TO AVOID ANY IMPACT TO THE AIRCRAFT IN DESTIN AREA. SO I THINK THAT IS THE THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A. PRETTY A RELIABLE SOURCE OF OF INFORMATION THAT THE LOCAL AIR TRAFFIC CENTER HAS IN HIS POSSESSION. DONE THE VARIOUS OPERATIONS THAT THEY CAN USE IT SENT OUT THEIR SPACE NOW QUESTIONS A VERY VALID ONE WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH A T. O. ATTRACT ORGANIZATION TO ADDRESS THOSE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS. I'M NOT A PROBLEM WE WE ANTICIPATE. THAT THE LOTTERY TO PICK UP. I THINK THE TIMING OF IT IS KIND UNCERTAIN BUT YOU CAN SEE IT COMING. I THINK THAT. IS IS OUR IS DUE DILIGENCE TO START TALKING ABOUT THESE THINGS MORE AND SEWER INTERACTING WITH A TEAL. AS OFTEN AS WE CAN TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE ANY MAJOR ISSUES. WITHIN PACK AND AIR SPACE DOES AS IT EXISTS TODAY. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALK ABOUT TWO IS THE POLICY REVIEW PALER REVIEW. FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY ALL PIECES OF THE VALUATION. SO THE COMPANIES THAT CAME UP EARLIER HAS ALL ALL HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS FOR OBTAINING A LICENSE FOR LUNCH SAY. THE PAYING A LICENSE FOR A LAUNCH VEHICLE. AND IN THE VERY RIGHT SOUTH OF THAT DIET LINE THERE WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL COMPLIANCE MONITORING SAGE. WHERE? ARE. SAFETY INSPECTORS ACTUALLY SIT ON CONSOLE FOR ALL OF THE VARIOUS MISSIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE CAPACITY A LICENSE AND. AND REPUTATION MADE AN APPLICATION. SO THIS IS A A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF WHAT THE CREDITOR PATH TO LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE. AND CURRENTLY HAS A SENSE TODAY SO. RIGHT NOW WE ARE ACTUALLY INVOLVED AND CONCERNED WITH JUST A PUBLIC SAFETY EXPECT OF THESE LAUNCHES. FROM VARIOUS PLACES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND WORLD. I THE SECOND PHASE THAT WE ARE ANTICIPATING HIS OCCUPANT SAFETY. WHICH WOULD ALSO INCLUDE A PUBLIC SAFETY OF THE ONCE SEE MORE TALK MORATORIUM EXPIRES. IF YOU STANDS ARE DEVELOPED WE ANTICIPATE THAT HAPPENING. IN IN THE NEAR TERM. ONE THING I DID ONE IMAGE INTO IN THE FIRST PHASE IS THAT WE DO HAVE A PART FOR SIXTY HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT REGULATE REGULATION. THAT'S IN EFFECT AND ARE OFFERS UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SPACE FLIGHT PARTICIPANTS ON THEIR INFORMED CONSENT REGIME. TO UP PARTICIPATING THESE VARIOUS. SPACE OPERATIONS OF FROM THE VARIOUS COMPANIES. AND UP TO THE FAR RIGHT. THERE IS. AND THAT'S ANOTHER BOX THEIR MISSION ASSURANCE. WE THINK AT SOME POINT AND I'M THINKING MAYBE A DECADE OR SO FROM NOW. WOODSTOCK CERTIFYING THESE UP PERSON SOMEONE WHO WHAT THE AVIATION IS IS DOING NOW FOR. THE AVIATION WORLD. OF INDEX SAID TIMING IS THAT IT'S NOT SURE. BUT THAT'S KIND OF DIRECTION WE'RE GOING AND TO PREPARE FOR THAT. AS WE GO TO A LICENSING PROCESS WE'RE LOOKING MORE INTO. A VEHICLE DEVELOPMENT. REASONABLE REUSABILITY OF DIFFERENT VEHICLES. THE MAINTENANCE THAT THE COMPANIES ARE CONSIDERING FOR. THE REPEATING FLIGHT SIM REP REPETITIVE FLIGHTS. SO THOSE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WILL FOCUS ON. FOR FOR THE FUTURE TESTS OF FLIGHT REGIME. AS IT MIGHT LOOK SIMILAR TO WHAT THE AVIATION WORLD IS CURRENTLY DONE. SO WHICH IS IT'S EXPECTED SPACE PORTS THIS IS A QUICK SNAPSHOT THINK COMMUNITY OUT BUT THIS EARLIER WE HAVE. TEN LICENSE SPACEPORT. ON SEVERAL IN VARIOUS STAGES OF LICENSING PROCESS IN PRE OP AND UNDER EVALUATION ABOUT HALF OF THOSE. WE'VE LICENSE HAVE REGULAR LAUNCH ACTIVITIES. FORTUNATELY I THINK I CAN SAY THIS PRINT PROBABLY THAT TWO OF THE MORE ACTIVE ONES ARE. IN CALIFORNIA. DANCE AREA AND ALSO IN MY HOBBY SO THAT IS VERY VERY. PROMISING FOR THE ACTIVIST IS HAPPENING OUT IN CALIFORNIA. OUR COMMERCIAL SPACE IN CALIFORNIA WE WE ARE ONCE ECONOMY. DISCUSS. CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO TO LICENSE FACE POOR AS I JUST MENTIONED. TEN PLUS EVERY OTHER BROWN'S VEHICLE OPERATIONS. ONE FAA IS TCO E. MEMBER UNIVERSITY. THROUGH OVER LAUNCH OPERATIONS. A NUMBER OF CELL LATE COMPANY SUPPLIERS AND OTHER RELIANCE ON THE LAUNCH INDUSTRY. INNOVATORS. IN SELLING SERVICING ASTEROIDS THE MOON MINING COMMERCIAL SPACE STATIONS AND MORE. ARE ALL HOME TO CALIFORNIA SPACE. CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE SOME NEW OVER THE LAUNCH TO. THEIR RESPECTIVE HAPPEN. INTO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. OF SUMMER THE HYBRID TIGHT LIKE THE V. G. CRITICAL ACTIVE VERSION ORBIT. AND AND OTHER COMPANIES LIKE SO MUCH AS WELL MAY BE IN THAT SAME CATEGORY. MAJOR SOURCES OF VENTURE CAPITAL LIKE I WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IT IS A IT'S A FOCAL POINT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE WE LOOK FORWARD TO A ASSISTING YOU IN ANY OF THESE ERRORS AT THE AS WE CAN FAA. THE MAP ON THE RIGHT TO SHOWS A BREAKDOWN OF THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF BAY AREA IN SACRAMENTO. A LOS ANGELES IN THE VARIOUS COMPANIES THAT ARE OPERATING OUT THERE THAT ARE ON THE COMMERCIAL SPACE. SAID DECAYING AND. MOJAVE UP LIKE WE SAID EARLIER IS A DUFFY A FOCAL POINT IN GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF ACTIVITY HERE IN THE NEAR TERM. THINK OF WILL MENTION THAT VERSION ELECTED JUST COMPLETED OUR A POWER FLIGHT AND THERE'S MORE TO COME HERE. IN THIS MONTH THE BEGINNING OF NEXT MONTH. SO FOR THE. HERE. OF FOR SPACE PORTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED. FOR THE STATE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY'VE SEEN SOME IN ECONOMIC DRIVERS IN HIGH TECH JOB CLUBS. WE LICENSE SPACE PUTS ON THE PART FOR TWENTY. ESSENTIALLY. WOULD LOOK AT IN ROMAN IMPACT TYPE OF OPERATIONS VEHICLE ENVISIONS. AIRSPACE ACCESS ARE REVIEWED SOME OF LISTING OUT IF YOU WERE TO APPLY FOR A LAUNCH SITE LYSONS. YOU WE WILL LOOK AT THE VARIOUS. COMPONENTS THAT WOULD HAVE US. YOU UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW THE OPERATION WOULD TAKE PLACE. IN A TYPE OF VEHICLES AS COULD BE ACCEPTING FROM THOSE LOCATIONS. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE THREE CATEGORIES OF VERTICAL LAUNCH. HORIZONTAL LAUNCH AND HIGH ALTITUDE BALLOON LAUNCH CAN ALSO BE. ON THE OUR AUTHORITY DEPENDING ON THE. FIT JUST GREATER THAN THAT OF CRITERIA THAT THAT WE OFTENTIMES LOOK AT TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. OF THE ACROPORA IS MUST APPLY FOR A SEPARATE LUNCH LICENSE OR PERMIT TO OPERATE FROM A SPECIFIC SPACE PORT. OF ENTRY IS INCREASINGLY USING FULLY COMMERCIAL SITE WHERE THEY MUST PROVIDE MORE OF THEIR OWN SERVICES. FOR INSTANCE GROUND SAFETY. IN ADDITION TO THE EXISTING FEDERAL FACILITY. I'LL FAA. HAS SET UP SPACE CATEGORIZATION AVIATION RULE MAKING COMMITTEES. THAT IS CURRENTLY IN WORK NOW ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE A BEEN BROUGHT FOR BY THE INDUSTRY WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY. WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS ON RULE MAKING HERE NEAR TERM THAT WILL HOPEFULLY IN THE TEN IS TO. MITIGATE SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS OR ISSUES THAT THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED. HERE IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO. A MAYES PUT MOST BASS PORTS HAVE OFFICIAL STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACTING A SOME DON'T AS WAS MISS MENTIONED EARLIER. FAA IS AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE SPACE TRANSPORTATION MATCHING GRANTS. WHEN APPROPRIATE WOULD PROFIT FUNDS AVAILABLE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE THE GRANT PROGRAM. IS THIS IN A KIND OF A BIT OF A HIATUS. IT WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR BUT IN AN ACTIVE SINCE. FY TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. I GUESS THE MAIN POINT I WANT TO MAKE HERE IS THAT. THE STEM IS STILL AUTHORIZED HAS BEEN FUNDED HAS NOT BEEN FUN FOR A FEW YEARS. BUT THIS COULD BE A CHANGE IF WE GET ENOUGH BUDGET. THE CALIFORNIA AEROSPACE COMMISSION IF IF CREATED. COMPLY FOR STEM GRANTS AND THE HAVE ON BEHALF OF TELEPHONE SPACEPORT. THIS DIM GRANT PROGRAM BECOMES ACTIVE AGAIN SO THIS IS A AYE AVENUE THAT THE COMMITTEE CAN CONSIDER. FOR THE GRANTS AND THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR VARIOUS. OPERATIONS ON THE COMMERCIAL SPACE UMBRELLA. THIS IS A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF OF. DIFFERENT VARIOUS. LAUNCHES THIS HAPPEN OVER THE YEARS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THERE'S BEEN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE LICENSE ON CHIP THEN THE PERIOD. OF FORTY FIVE PERMIT LAUNCHES. THE THERE'S BEEN INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. PARTICULARLY. BECAUSE OF THE SATELLITE SERVICES HAS BEEN PROVIDED. YOU CAN SEE. THE TRAIN OF DIPPING IN AND KIND OF COMING UP. WOULD PUT THE NUMBER OF FLIGHTS SO THE NAME OF YEARS. THAT'S TYPICALLY DO TO. IF YOU WOULD HAVE SOME COUNTY EVENT IN A AND A OPERATION. THAT WE CANNOT AFFECT THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY. IF AS A COMMON COMPONENT OR COMMON INJURY OF COMMON. TYPE OF FLIGHT. A KIND OF. TRICKLES DOWN IN EFFECT INTO INDUSTRY BUT LATELY THAT THE TRAIN HAS BEEN GOING UP QUITE A BIT AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN. THAT TYPE OF. ISSUE THAT WOULD IMPACT THE INCREASE IN INDUSTRY THAT MUCH IN AND THE. ELEVEN LATER YEARS. SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE INJURIES IS EXPANDING ITS COMMERCIAL CAPABILITIES. WITH A VARIETY OF LAUNCH OPERATIONS TIM FROM BG. HYBRID WING LAUNCH SYSTEM TO BLUE ORIGINS AND SPACEX'S. OF VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND WHOSE ABILITY FOR FIRST DAYS LANDINGS AND THEN ALSO THAT. THE BIGELOW ARIS BIGELOW AEROSPACE WHO MANUFACTURES AND DEVELOPS. EXPANDABLE SPACE STATIONS OF MODULES. I THINK THE CHARTER IS A IS A GOOD INDICATOR FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IN INDUSTRY. AND SOME OF THE THE EXCITING. COMMERCIAL SPACE ADVENTURE OPERATES NAKED THAT'S. PROBABLY DOWN. A LITTLE BIT BUT SURELY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CONSIDER HAPPENING. AND A NEAR TERM. SO INVESTMENTS IN NEW MARKETS IN AND VEHICLES. I JUST LIKE TO SUMMARIZE BUSTING THE COMMERCIAL SPACE HAS BEEN. SEEN RECORD INVESTMENT OVER LAST COUPLE YEARS. AND SPECIFICALLY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A STUDY FOUND PRIVATE INVESTMENTS IN COMMERCIAL SPACE. OVERALL HAS INCREASED. AND MANY OF THE COMPANIES RECEIVING FUNDING ARE BASED IN CALIFORNIA. GOT INCLUDING THE VENTURE VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS THEY'RE GETTING HEAVILY AYE INVOLVED LATELY. A COMMERCIAL MONEY A GIVEN REVENUE FROM A GLOBAL SPACE ACTIVITY WAS ABOUT. TOWARD TO SIXTY BILLION IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THE TALK SHOWS THAT MOST OF THE MONEY COMES FROM. SATELLITE SERVICE OF GROUND EQUIPMENT. WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT LAUNCHES IS ONLY A FRACTION OF THE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS FOR. COMMERCIAL MONEY. IN THIS SHOWS HOW IMPORTANT LAUNCH AN AIDS TEES MISSION. IS RELATED AND INFLUENCES THE INDUSTRY. SUCCESS AND AND. NO SWORDS AT THE MONEY HOUSE GOING TO BE. ADMIT INTO THE THE WHOLE PROCESS. FAA AND NATIONAL GOES SO THAT THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE HERE IS THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY. STALKING WITH VARIOUS COMPANIES AND. FROM OVERSEAS. AND WILL WORK WITH OTHER COUNTRIES INTERESTED HOSTING US LAUNCH OPERATIONS OR DEVELOPING THEIR OWN. ALSO OTHER OBJECTIVES IS TO SUPPORT US COMPANIES. THAT. THAT. THINK THEY HAVE A BUSINESS CASE OVERSEAS ARE THAT WE CAN HELP WITH. THIS CHART SHOWS AND EXPAND THE FOOTPRINT OF WORLDWIDE INCLUDING THE EXISTING PROPOSED GLOBAL SPACE PORT. NEW ZEALAND. BELOW US BELOW OSTROWY THERE AS A NEW LAUNCH COMPANY AT THINK WAS MUCH EARLIER. BUT BASS OTHER CALIFORNIA. WITH ROCKET LAB. OF THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF. DIFFERENT THINGS LATELY AND ACTUALLY WORKING A. S.. FOR THEIR UPCOMING MISSION AND IS DOING. AND IN THE COMING MONTHS. WE ALSO WORKING WITH UNITED EVERY. ARAB EMIRATES EMMERICH'S UK ITALY AND BRAZIL. AND LOOKING AT COMMERCIAL LAUNCH SITES IN THE VARIOUS. LOCATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. SO THE CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR A IS T.. IS ANOTHER AREA OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN A. S. T. AND THE CALIFORNIA SPACE INDUSTRY. RIGHT NOW STAMP IS IS A MEMBER. NASA AMES IS AN ASSOCIATE MEMBER USC IS WORKING ON BECOMING AN AFFILIATE MEMBER I AM BERKELEY HAS SHOWN A LOT A LOT OF INTEREST RECENTLY. WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. YOU CAN SEE THE TOP FOUR ITEM ZERO THE FOCAL POINTS AEROSPACE TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SPACE POOR OPERATIONS. SPACE TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES IN SPACE FLIGHT AND INITIATE VIABILITY. AND THAT THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO THAT THE VARIOUS. OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE THERE FOR A MEMBER OF THEY WERE TO BECOME INVOLVED A HALF INTEREST IN. AND WHAT WE'RE PRESENTING HERE. UNDER THE CO E. PROGRAM. SO LOOKING AHEAD I THINK THE TO TAKE AWAY IS THAT. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS WAS DISCUSSING WAYS IS T. AND THE COP FOUR YEAR. AEROSPACE COMMITTEE COMMISSION COULD INTERACT IN SUPPORT OF OTHER EACH OTHER'S EFFORT. OUR WILL TO REFORM EFFORTS. FOR THE ARTICLE ON THE WAY AND TALKED ABOUT THIS A MINUTE AGO. AIRSPACE ACCESS SPACE PORTS INNER. GRETA REFORMS ARE THE THREE ARCS THAT ARE. HAD BEEN PICKED UP THE PACE HAVE GREAT INTERACTION WITH INDUSTRY I THINK IT SERVED ITS PURPOSE. THE GOAL NOW IS TO GET THE RULE MAKING NOW. THAT. REALLY ADDRESSES SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE. DISCUSSED BETWEEN A. S. T. AN ENTRY REGARDING OF LAUNCHING CAPABILITY STREAMLINING. AND CAN MAKE IN THE THE. REGULATIONS MORE MORE EFFICIENT. SUPPORT TODAY'S INDUSTRY. OF POTENTIAL FIAC INTERACTION WITH THE CALIFORNIA AEROSPACE COMMISSION. OF SO WE HAVE IN THAT THE TO SUPPOSE THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT. ONE OF THE WITH THE COMMISSION IN TERMS OF. HOW THE LICENSING STEM GRANT SIMILAR TO ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER STE STATE LEVEL SPACE DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES? OF THE FIRST QUESTION IS. WILL COMMISSION WORK WITH AIRFORCE WHEN NASA TO EXPAND COMMERCIAL USE. OF VANDENBERG ON STONE SIMILAR TO WHAT SPACE FLORIDA DOES IN IN. ON THE EAST COAST WITH NASA AND KSC. THAT'S THE QUESTION THE LOVE THE COMMISSION SUPPORT FROM A HOBBY. OF THE SPACEPORT KIND OF ONE UNDERSTAND. YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AND HOW WE MIGHT BE OF HELP YOU WITH THOSE ENDEAVORS. AND THEN FURTHER COLLABORATION ON THE ROAD TO REFORM ENTRY PROMOTES A EFFORTS. OUR RESEARCH COLLABORATION WITH UNIVERSITY MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE PREOCCUPATION CONSULTATION AND LICENSING FOR THE VARIOUS VEHICLE OPERATIONS. OTHER INC OTHER COMPANIES LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA. SO THAT IS THE THE END OF THE PRESENTATION. TRYING TO. CAN GET TO WITH THE INTEREST OF TIME. BUT THANK YOU AGAIN FROM THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING TODAY PUBLIC FOURTEEN QUESTIONS. RIGHT. BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS A. IT'S REALLY. A GREAT INFORMATION AND AND. HAVING A PRESENTED FROM ALL THREE OF YOU TOGETHER AND IT HELPS ME UNDERSTAND. CALVET ALL COMES TOGETHER. SO. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A. MS TREES. THE FIRST. YOU. GIVE US SOME. VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS ON. HOW THIS THE STATE CAN NO BETTER SUPPORT THE MOJAVE SPACEPORT AS WELL AS OTHER POTENTIAL SPACE PORTS AS? THE COUNCIL. SUGGESTED. SO THE. YOU I I BELIEVE YOU INDICATED THAT. THAT YOU. RECEIVE NO FAA FUNDS WITH ITS AT THAT THE STEM GRANTS. CRACKED SO ó AS A GENERAL AVIATION AIRPORT WERE ENTITLED TO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS PER YEAR AND WE DON'T GET ANY KIND OF A GRANT. PROGRAM. FOR BEING A SPACE PORT.THE STIM GRANTS THAT'S CHAIRMAN MENTIONED. DATE DRIED UP I THINK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. THOSE WERE A FIFTH IT WAS A FIFTY FIFTY PROGRAM AND I THINK IT MAXED OUT OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. IF I'M OF THE THE TYPES OF GRANTS THAT WE NEED A FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PERMITS ARE IN THE MILLIONS. SO THE THE PROGRAMS THAT EXIST TODAY THAT WERE ELIGIBLE FOR DON'T MEET THOSE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY FACING. YOU INDICATED THAT YOU ARE ROBERT WELL REPRESENTED BY. A CONGRESSMAN AND. MCCARTHY. HAS HE. DELIVERED ANY FEDERAL FUNDS FOR. SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE SO I AM I US FROM DEALING WITH THE CHALLENGE CURRENTLY AND. I WASN'T SURE WHETHER I WOULD MAKE ANY PROGRESS WITHIN THE FAA SO MY FIRST CALL WAS TO HIS OFFICE. OF EXPLAINING THE CHALLENGE AND SAYING I NEED I NEED HELP GETTING SOME KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY. AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT OTHER AVENUES FOR US RIGHT NOW. IN TERMS OF THE. ABILITY TO BORROW MONEY ARE YOU ARE YOU. YEAH ARE YOU SUGGESTING LIKE BOND FUNDS FROM THE STATE. AS ODESSA SOURCE OF AN. INFRASTRUCTURE ASSISTANCE. WHAT WOULD BE EASIEST FOR US IS TO JUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE OUT ARE A REGULAR BANK CLONE JUST SAYS MOST ENTITIES CARE ON? BECAUSE OF THE REGION OR IN ITS IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO RAISE BOND MONEY AND WE HAVE VERY SMALL DISTRICT AND NOT A LOT OF A PROPERTY OWNERS. ARE PRESENT IN THAT DISTRICT SO MOST THINGS MOST THINGS GET VOTED DOWN TO THE EXTENT THAT ARE STREET LIGHTS WERE RIPPED OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE VOTED DOWN HAVE EVERY TRIED. WELL WE HAVE NOT TRIED RAISING BONDS FOR THE AIRPORT. BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A FRUITFUL EFFORT. AND VERY LABOR INTENSIVE. THE OTHER AVENUE THAT WE WERE SUGGESTED TO PURSUE WAS THROUGH AYE BANK AND. AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF PURSUING AYE BANK. AYE IT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT I HAD ON THE TABLE AT THAT. AT THE MOMENT. WAS PURSUING THE I THINK FUNDS AND BY THE TIME I GOT THE INVITATION TO APPLY FOR THE I HATE FUNDS. THAT OPPORTUNITY DRIED UP. SO I ADDED ESSENTIALLY START OVER. SO THAT THAT PROCESS WAS WAS ALSO QUITE FRUSTRATING WE THIRDS ASSEMBLYMAN OF LACKEY AT ONE POINT INTRODUCED SOME LEGISLATION THAT WOULD HELP US WITH THE GETTING A NEGOTIABLE NOTE. A AND. THE ASSEMBLY DIDN'T DIDN'T SEEM TO PUSH BACK BUT THE SENATE DID. SO IT GOT HELD UP AND SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE. AND THEY CAME BACK TO US BASICALLY SAYING WE HAD WE HAD NOT PURSUE ALL AVENUES. WE COULD GO THROUGH AN INVESTMENT BANKER WE COULD DO ALL THESE OTHER OPTIONS BUT THE REALITY IS. EVERY OTHER OPTION IS VERY EXPENSIVE FOR US AS A PUBLIC ENTITY. AND WHERE IT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL ORGANIZATION. ANYTHING OTHER THAN A TRADITIONAL BANK LOAN WITH A WITH A NORMAL INTEREST RATE IS JUST TOO EXPENSIVE AN OPTION FOR US. SO ANYTHING THAT WE WOULD BUILD AT THE END OF THE DAY WE PASS THROUGH THOSE COST TO OUR CUSTOMERS. AND AND THOSE COSTS ARE TO BECOME VERY COST PROHIBITIVE VERY QUICKLY. SO YOU WOULD BE LESS THAN OF ACTION TO BE ABLE TO. TO GET A A. STANDARD COMMERCIAL BANK LOANS YES. THE THEIR PC TWO TWO FIVE FIVE SEVEN LIMITS ITS ITS SPECIFIC AIRPORT DISTRICTS AND LIMITS BORROWING TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR NO GOOD FOR NEGOTIABLE NOTES SETS THE STANDARD BANK LOAN. I'M NOT SURE FOR. I A NO WE STILL HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM. VERSION AND. SPACEX. BUT THEM. TELL I ASK YOU FIRST. WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN? THE. WHERE THESE COMPANIES ARE LAUNCHING AND WHERE THEY WOULD MANUFACTURE? THERE. ROCKETS SO THE MORE MANUFACTURING IN MOJAVE SO TAKE VIRGIN ORDER FOR EXAMPLE VIRGIN ORBIT. THEY'RE DOING THEIR ROCKY MANUFACTURING IN LONG BEACH. THEY'RE DOING ALL THEIR ROCKET TESTING IN MOJAVE AND THEY INTEND TO DO LAUNCHES FROM HARVEY AS WELL. BECAUSE IT'S SO THEIR SEVEN FORTY SEVEN IS NOT HOUSED IN MOJAVE BUT WHEN THEY GET READY TO DO WILL LAUNCH THEIR THIS I'M FORTY SEVENTY MOHAVE. THEY BRING THE ROCKETS TO MOJAVE. ANYTHING THEY MAY HAVE ON SITE IS JUST AN EASY WAY TO TRANSPORT. AND THEN THEY WOULD CONDUCT THEIR LUNCHES FROM THERE. THEY'RE INTERESTED POTENTIALLY AN EXPANDING OF FOOTPRINT IN MOJAVE BECAUSE THEY HAVE SEVERAL EMPLOYEES SAID ARE DRIVING UP FROM LONG BEACH REGULARLY. SO THEY'VE GOT TEMPORARY STRUCTURES SET OUT FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES AND THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE A AND ACTUAL FACILITY FOR THEM. AND A MINIMUM A CONCRETE PAD IS DEDICATED FOR THEIR USE SO. PRIOR TO THAT THERE ARE STILL JUST BE USING OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO THEIR LUNCH PROP. I ADMIT I WOULD OPEN UP TO TO ANY OF THE PANELISTS BETTER. MAIN. THIS SEEMS TO LOGISTICALLY MAKE SENSE THAT THERE. YOU'D WANT TO MANUFACTURE. NEAR WHERE YOU'RE LAUNCHING. YES. SO I AM I A DENTAL DEFTLY TOUCHED ON THIS I'M SURE AS WELL BUT. ARE ARE ISSUE REALLY IS WELL COUPLE THINGS. THE REMOTE LOCATION WE HAVE IS FAVORABLE TO LAUNCH OPERATIONS BUT NOT SO MUCH WHEN IT COMES TO RECRUITING TALENT. SO AND THE REASON THAT COMPANIES LIKE VIRGIN ORDERFOR INSTANCE ARE LOCATED ALONG THE JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THEY CAN RECRUIT THE ENGINEERS. OUTSIDE THAT ARE WILLING TO DO THOSE JOBS ARE HAPPY TO DO THOSE JOBS IT'S A LOT HARDER TO RECRUIT THAT TALENT TO THE ANTELOPE VALLEY. SO THAT'S THAT'S JUST REALITIES ARE LOCATION. YEAH I'D SAY. SEE CERTAINLY TOUCHED ON. LOGISTICS ISSUES THAT THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AYE AYE MY POINT OUT A FEW EXAMPLES OF SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE MANUFACTURING. IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY'RE TAKING THEIR LAUNCH ELSEWHERE. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO DO FIRST OR SECOND TYPE LAUNCHES. SO IT'S ALL BASED ON VENTURE CAPITALIST THEY'RE TRYING IT JUST PROVED THEIR SYSTEM. AYE ANYWHERE WHERE THEY CAN SAVE MONEY THEY'RE LOOKING TO SAVE. AND. AND SO RIGHT NOW THEY. IF THEY BEEN FACED WITH A WORKMAN THE LAST YEAR TO WITH THIS DECISION. WE WANNA PAY ACTUALLY JUST SIX AND TAKE IT TO KODIAK WHERE KODIAK HAS SOME MORE INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE THE STATE WILL WORK WITH US AND WHERE WE ONLY HAVE TO DO WITH ONE FEDERAL AGENCY THE FAA WHO LICENSE OUR LAUNCH. WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL DEPARTMENT DEFENSE IN A FEDERAL RANGE. OR DO WE TRADE THAT OFF AND SAVE ON THE JOYSTICKS BUT DAN. HAVE THE INCREASED COSTS OF DEALING WITH THE FEDERAL RANGE. AND THAT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ALL CHOOSING TO GO ELSEWHERE. THERE'S THERE'S SEVERAL OTHER COMPANIES THAT. SO IN ADDITION TO HAVE A POOR LAUNCH CAPABILITY WHICH I TALKED ABOUT. I'LL OBVIOUSLY THESE COMPANIES ALSO ONE EQUATORIAL LAUNCH SO THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING AT FLORIDA AND VIRGINIA. AND. IN THOSE STATES. ESPECIALLY FLORIDA AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE SPACE FLORIDA HAS BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE IN ATTRACTING BUSINESS THERE'D SO THEY DO MATCHING INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS. AND SO THE THE EXAMPLE THERE IS YOU GOT TO START A COMPANY WHO WANTS TO DO THEIR FIRST LAUNCH. AND YOU CAN EITHER COME TO CALIFORNIA AND. INVEST A BUNCH OF MONEY AND INFRASTRUCTURE YOU NEED OR YOU GO TO FLORIDAWHERE THE STATE OF FLORIDA WILL INVEST IN YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE. THEY'RE GONNA PROVE OUT THERE CONCEPTS IN FLORIDA. AUGUST ONCE THEY PROVE THEIR CONCEPTS THEY ALL THEIR BUSINESS MODELS SAY. THE CUSTOMERS ARE GONNA COME ONCE WE START LAUNCHING SUCCESSFULLY. RUN HAVE TONS OF CUSTOMERS AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD YOU EXTRA INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER PLACES. PASSOVER SO RIGHT NOW I AM UNITS. IT IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THESE COMPANIES AND INCLUDING ROCKET LAB WOULD LOVE TO GET A LAUNCH FROM CALIFORNIA. BUT THEY JUST FELT IT WAS EASIER TO GO ELSEWHERE AND THAT'S WHY THEY DECIDE TO BUILD THEIR OWN OVERSEE SPACEPORT. MMHM. DOT THE EIGHT ALSO BRINGS UP CHALLENGES WHEN THESE SO THESE COMPANIES ARE GOING AFTER THE SMALL SET MARKET. WHICH NOW THE GOVERNMENT'S GETTING INTERESTED. AND SO. IT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY SMALL SAD SINCE AND CLASSIFY PAYLOADS. IT IT BECOMES MUCH MORE CHALLENGING TO SHIP THE PAYLOAD BECAUSE OF AYE TO OUR CONCERNS OR. OVER TO NW ZEALAND FOR A LAUNCH OR EVEN UP TO ALASKA. THEY WOULD THEY WOULD MUCH RATHER KEEP IT. LOCAL AND KEEP IT IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES AND. SO SO I I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF INCENTIVES. FOR. FOR EVENTUALLY FOR THESE COMPANIES TO BE HERE CALIFORNIA BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT FOR STARTING OUT. OR. YOU KNOW. I I NOTICED ON YOUR MAP THAT TO. THAT'S SPACEX'S BUILDING. THE LAUNCH PAD IN TEXAS. HIS IS. MAN I CAN ASK THEM AND SEE IF AVARICE A RESPONSE BUT. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THE. IS IT IS THAT. AN INDICATION THAT PERHAPS SOME. OF THOSE. SPACEX MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE COULD BE FOLLOWING THE LAUNCH PAD TO TEXAS. WELL I I PLEDGE. MAY LIE PROMESAS. WHITE AND BUT I THINK YOU KNOW. THE THE LOCATION OF THE LAUNCH PAD OFTEN DEPENDS ON WHERE THE LAUNCH IS GOING SO WE LAUNCH OUT OF CAPE CANAVERAL AND. WERE SENDING AYE. ARE CARGO DRAGON CURRENTLY AND EVENTUALLY CREW DRAG INTO INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION SOMETIMES IT HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE TRAJECTORY OF WHERE THE LAUNCH IS GOING. R. HOFFMAN FACILITY WE'RE NOW UP TO A MILLION AND A HALF SQUARE FEET. AS OUR CAMPUS FOR OUR DESIGN PRODUCTION MANUFACTURING SO THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT. I AM I THINK THEY WOULD BE EAGER TO PICK UP AND MOVE BUT YES THERE THEY ARE LOOKING AT. HOPE AN ADDITIONAL LAUNCH FACILITY IN TEXAS. AND ALL OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH IT BEING FURTHER SOUTH EVEN ON THE CAPE SO IT REALLY HAS TO DO WITH WHERE THE LAUNCHERS ARE GOING. AND. AND WE WE ARE RAMPING UP OUR LAUNCH KIDS GOING OUT OF VANDENBERG SO THERE'S STILL A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT TO HEAR TO CALIFORNIA HANDS AND WE DON'T. OR SEE THAT CHANGING BUT IN TERMS OF THE THE THE LAUNCH IS SET TO BE TAKING PLACE IN TEXAS. AS OF NOW THE THE MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN THOSE. ROCKET SHIP YES THOUGH ALL OF OUR ALL OF OUR ROCKETS ARE MANUFACTURED HERE IN OUR HAWTHORNE FACILITY. AND THERE IS. WHEAT YOU HEARD FROM OTHER PANELISTS THAT THEY DO ENGINE TESTING AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WE DO OUR TESTING AND TEXAS. BUT OUR MANUFACTURING IS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT TESTING ROCKET ENGINES AND URBAN LOS ANGELES WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE. AND WHICH IS WHY ARE TESTING FOR THE ENGINE FIRING AND DOESN'T HAPPEN AT OUR FACILITY BUT OUR MANUFACTURING IS ALL HERE IN AND HAWTHORNE FOR THE TIME BEING. OKAY THANK YOU. AND SAY. OF MR KAELIN IT'S A GALLON YES. YOU. POST A QUESTION WHY ARE THESE WIRE SOME COMPANIES LAUNCHING OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA HE TALKED ABOUT THE SPACE WORSE SPACEPORT INFRASTRUCTURE. THE REGULATORY HURDLES. ALTHOUGH YOU INITIALLY START TALKING ABOUT. THAT. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF COMPLYING WITH REGULATIONS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT JUST A STATE. AROUND. ARE YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT THIS THE NEED FOR STREAMLINING REGULATIONS THOSE ARE PRIMARILY. IN THE AREA OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. YES SIR SO ENVIRONMENTAL. AS WELL AS. JUST IN GENERAL SAFETY REGULATIONS WHICH IS BOTH IT'S BOTH CAL OSHA AS WELL AS. AT AS. AT VANDERBURGH BEING ON THE FEDERAL PROPERTY SO WE DO WHAT'S WITH FEDERAL SAFETY AND DIED VANDERBURGH SAFETY AS WELL. THAT DAY. WHILE A LOT OF TIMES THOSE THOSE DIFFERENT REGULATIONS WHETHER IT'S CALIFORNIA OR FEDERAL. THEIR CONFLICTING. SO IF A COMPANY IS. DURING THEIR FIRST LAUNCHES IN IN ALASKA WHERE THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE. LENIENT ON SOME OF THOSE REGULATIONS THAT WHEN THEY COME TO TRANSPORT THEIR OPERATIONS TO CALIFORNIA IF IT BRINGS ON ADDITIONAL COSTS. IT AS AT THE FAA MENTIONED YOUR EVERY TIME THEY WANT. ANYONE OF THESE COMPANIES WANTS TO LAUNCH THAT. I GET SAME EXACT ROCKET FROM A DIFFERENT SPACE PORT IT IT GOES THROUGH A WHOLE NEW LICENSING PROCESS HER SPACEPORT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S SPECIFIC TO THE LOCATION. AND SO HOT SO NOT ONLY DO THEY GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS WITH THE FAA WHEN THEY COME TO CALIFORNIA. BUT THEN THEY ALSO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS WITH THE FEDERAL RANGE AND AND FLYING ON THE RANGE AND ALL THE RANGE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT THEY LEVY ON THEM. OKAY. BUT THAT WOULD BE ON ONE OF THE. PERHAPS AREAS THAT SHOULD WE SUCCEED IN ESTABLISHING THE CALIFORNIA AEROSPACE COMMISSION THAT THEY CAN TAKE THE LEAD IN AND WORKING WITH THE FAA AND ABSOLUTELY. OUT OKAY. I WANT TO WELCOME A SENATOR ALLEN. THEY THEY CHAIR OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON AEROSPACE AS WELL AS. MY PARTNER IN CRIME IN AND. CHAMPIONING THE CALIFORNIA AEROSPACE COMMISSION WELCOME SENATOR WHICH YOU WERE I'VE THAT I THINK YOU I JUST WANNA POLICY BECAUSE FOR TAKING SO LONG TO GET HERE I WAS CHAIRING EDUCATION I PRESENTED A BILL. IS THE TIME OF THE YEAR. BUT BUT I I CERTAINLY DID MIGHT MY STAFF HAS BEEN MONITORING THIS I'VE BEEN DOING SOME REPORTS AND I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO BE HERE AND I'M. VERY NICE IN THE TOPICS ON THE TO BE SPENT SOME TIME GOING TO THE MATERIALS. AS. I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS AS SENATOR ALAN. AND I. REPRESENT WHAT. I DESCRIBED EARLIER AS THE AEROSPACE CAPITAL THE WORLD. THE. THE EL SEGUNDO SOUTH BAY AREA. AND. VERY GOOD CAESAR. YEAH. SO. THEY WERE ACTUALLY. ABOUT TO WRAP UP HERE BUT. MR KELSO. OKAY. OKAY. MISTER MISTER PRIMER AND SAX ACTUALLY. I WANTED TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ALSO ON. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A LAN SITES AND WHERE MEN FASHION TASTE BUDS ABSOLUTELY HAPPY HAPPY TO THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION. SO AS MYSTERIES IS INDICATED EARLIER ARE ALL THE VIRGIN COMPANIES ALWAYS HAVE AND I ANTICIPATE ALWAYS WILL MANUFACTURE ALL OF OUR VEHICLES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT SYSTEM RIGHT THERE IN THE HOBBY AND ARE A BILL ON SYSTEM I. DOWN DOWN IN LONG BEACH. AS MYSTERIES ALSO INDIATED WE WILL LAUNCH FROM A HOBBY BUT ALSO FROM OTHER PLACES SO FOR THE HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT PROGRAM ALL THE TEST LAUNCH IS NOT JUST FOR THE FIRST VEHICLES THAT BUT FOR ALL THE SUBSEQUENT ONES THAT WE BUILD THOSE WILL ALWAYS OCCUR FOR MOJAVE. MY HAT'S OFF TO TO MYSTERIES FOR OUT FOR AS SHE AS SHE INDICATED HAVING A FACILITY THAT REALLY DOES MANAGE AIRCRAFT LIKE OPERATIONS AIRLINE LIKE OPERATIONS WHERE WE CAN DO THINGS THAT. ON RELATIVELY SHORT NOTICE AND WITHOUT WITH A LIGHT FOOTPRINT IN A AND A LOW COST INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED. SO THE THE TEST FLIGHTS WILL HAPPEN FROM. WILL HAPPEN FROM A HOBBY THAT COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS WILL HAPPEN FROM THAT FROM THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO AND POTENTIALLY FROM OTHER LOCATIONS AND EACH YEAR. AND THAT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A TOURISM ACTIVITY THAT IS AN AEROSPACE ACTIVITY ON THE OFFICE IT'S AT THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN THE TWO OF THOSE. FOR THE VIRGIN ORBIT SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND WITH OUR ORBITAL SATELLITE LAUNCH PROGRAM AGAIN WE HAVE A WE JUST ACQUIRED A NEW FACILITY IN ADDITIONAL FACILITY AT DOUGLAS PART IN LONG BEACH SO WE'RE EXPANDING OUR PRESENCE THERE AND. AND HAVE NO PLANS TO OR INTERESTS FRANKLY IN IN IN IN EVER LEAVING THEIR IT'S A WONDERFUL HOME FOR MONTHS. OUT WE WILL LAUNCH FROM MANY DIFFERENT PLACES IT'S ONE OF OUR MAIN. COMPETITOR TO MANAGES THE THINGS THAT WE OFFER TO OUR CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO FLY THEIR SATELLITES FROM WHERE THEY WANT TO FLY TO WHERE THEY WANT TO FLY FROM. SO ALL OF OUR INITIAL TEST FLIGHTS WILL HAPPEN ALSO FROM A HOBBY AT IT'S A FANTASTIC FACILITY FOR US TO LAUNCH INTO WHAT ARE CALLED POLAR INCLINATION ORBITS OVER BITS THAT GO OVER THE NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH POLE. NOT SO WE'LL BE DOING OUR FIRST POLAR LAUNCH FROM A HOBBY IN A MATTER OF MONTHS. AND THEN NOT ONLY OUR TEST FLIGHTS WILL HAPPEN THERE BUT MANY PERHAPS ALL OF OUR PORT POLAR FLIGHTS WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN FROM THERE. AND POLAR LAUNCHES OUR A FAIRLY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OF OF THAT TERM COMMERCIAL MET DEMAND THAT WE'VE SEEN THUS FAR. FOUR SATELLITES I WANT TO GO TO OTHER ORBITAL DESTINATIONS THAT MAYBE ONE OF YOUR BRING AROUND THE EQUATOR RATHER THAN AROUND THE POLES. OUT BOTH THE LAWS OF NATURE AND THE LAWS OF HUMANS INDICATE THAT CALIFORNIA'S PROBABLY NOT THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THAT DO YOU REALLY WANT TO LAUNCH FROM SOMEWHERE THAT'S A MUCH LOWER LATITUDE. AND SO THAT'S WHY PLACES FOR OTHER SPACE COMPANIES AND FOR USAS WELL PLACES LIKE FLORIDA OR THE MARSHALL ISLANDS OR A BARGE THAT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC. HAVE STARTED TO BE MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR THOSE IT'S A CERTAINLY WE WILL BE LAUNCHING FROM FROM LOTS OF DIFFERENT PLACES BUT I ANTICIPATE THAT CALIFORNIA WILL ALWAYS BE AN IMPORTANT. PLACE THAT WERE ABLE TO OFFER TUCKED OUR CLIENTELE. OKAY THANK YOU. SERTANEJA VIA. QUESTIONS SUMMER YES. WELL IT DIDN'T SLOW PREFER SPACE SECTION AND I AND I THINK THAT WE DIDN'T MAKE A GOOD POINT OF THAT THE REASON WHY WE'RE BUILDING MCALLEN'S TO BE FURTHER SOUTH. THEN AND THEN THE CAPE AND THAT IS REALLY FOR. OUR LUNCHES GOING AROUND THE ORBITAL GREATER. ART VANDENBERG IS THIS IS USUALLY PER POLAR LAUNCHES. PRODUCES. AS. VIRGIN SAID IT'S. ALL ABOUT PHYSICS SO. WE. WERE NOT THAT WE'RE NOT MOVING AND BUILDING A NEW FACILITY FOR REASONS OTHER THAN. THE THE BUSINESS OF WE YOU KNOW OF THAT LAUNCH. DEMANDS. THANK YOU. YOU HAVE THE POWER. ALRIGHT. SO MISTER KELSEY TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE. ACTIVITIES TAKING PLACE AROUND THE FAA CENTER FOR EXCELLENCE FOR COMMERCIAL SPACE. TRANSPORTATION. YOU SET FORTH. SOME. NEITHER WORK IN TERMS OF THE AEROSPACE COMMISSION WORKING WITH THE AIRFORCE AND NASA THE. SUPPORT FOR MOJAVE AND OTHER POTENTIAL SPACE PORTS. YEAH SO I THINK A. YEAH SHE JUST WERE LOOKING FOR NOT IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT WE WERE ASKING ABOUT YOU KNOW SOME TO WHAT SPACE FLORIDA DOESN'T AND FLORA FOR NASA. WOULD THERE BE SOME SIX AND CASINO CAME FROM THE COMMITTEE TO. TO SOME SIMILAR GAL OR. SO I I THINK I MEAN I I KNOW THAT WHEN AND WHENEVER I'M A. MAKING MY PICKS FOR THE BILL AND AS I'LL BE MAKING THE PITCH TO OUR SENATORS AND AND. HAVE. PASSED THE BATON DO CENTER ALLEN HOPEFULLY WHEN HE GETS TO THE FLOOR. AND THEN WELL WILL LOBBY THE GOVERNOR BUT. THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS COMMISSION IS TO CHAMPION. AEROSPACE IN CALIFORNIA. AND AND TO. RECOGNIZE THAT OTHER STATES ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO. LURE. YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY ARE MEANT AEROSPACE JOBS FROM CALIFORNIA. AND. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT. YOU KNOW SUPPORTING MOJAVE ANOTHER POTENTIAL SPACE SPORTS. WOULD SUPPORT. KEEPING THE MANUFACTURING JOBS IN CALIFORNIA I I CERTAINLY SEE THAT AS AS PART OF. THAT THE MISSION OF OF THIS PROPOSED COMMISSION. ON THE HAVE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS. I I WILL DEFINITELY SAY THAT. A LOT OF US IN THE INDUSTRY ARE ARE. YOU KNOW VERY WELL VERSED ON WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL STATE LEVEL AND IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. OF WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE ANY OF THAT INFORMATION A WITH THE COMMISSION. IT WHENEVER WHENEVER NECESSARY SO ALWAYS HAVE HER HAPPY TO PURCHASE IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS OKAY. AND DO WE GET INTO THE ROLE OF NASA DRIVE BECOME KIND OF AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DISCUSSION. OR LIKE WERE AND WHERE YOU SEE THE FUTURE OF NASA GOING GIVEN THAT. WHAT'S GONNA TELL GOVERNMENT. OF WE WE REALLY DIDN'T I THINK. THERE'S I MEAN THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN. REALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE COMMERCIAL COMPANIES WHETHER IT'S NASSER DOD. AND A LOT OF THESE COMMERCIAL COMPANIES ARE STARTING TO SEE A LOT MORE PARTICIPATION. AS NOT JUST IT'S NOT JUST THE OLD SPACE COMPANIES LIKE BOEING LOCKHEED NORTHRUP THE TRADITIONAL CONTRACT OF WINTERS OF SOME OF THESE. CONTRACTS FOR CITIES INITIATIVES IT'S IT'S NOW SPACEX WHO WERE CHEN VIRGIN GALACTIC. THESE ARE COMPANIES THAT ARE NOW REALLY. A PLAYER IN AND WITH. THE DOD IN THE NASA CONTRACTOR. BUT SO ARE ARE FOCUSED. YEAH I HAS BEEN ON THE COMMERCIAL. A SIDE OF US. THAT THE SPACE INDUSTRY. WE WE HEARD AND NOW I FORMA SPACEX AND VIRGIN GALACTIC AND AND THE AFFILIATED TO VERSION ORBIT. THE FAMILY OF COMPANIES I BELIEVE WAS YOUR YOUR TERM. BUT ALSO. THE. GROWING SPACE. ENTREPRENEURIAL ISM. AND AND THE ROLE OF VENTURE CAPITAL WE HAVE THE SO THIS IS REALLY IS A MATTER OF FACT RECREATION PEOPLE WANT TO GO TO SPACE TO SEE IT ALL WE TALKED ABOUT THAT AND ABOUT TO IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS HOPEFULLY. SIR BRANSON WILL BE. THAT THE FIRST. SPACE TRAVELER IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THAT'S WHAT I AND I THINK I HEARD THERE RIGHT. HIM. AND THAT. HOPEFULLY IN OUR LIFETIMES WILL HAVE A LEGISLATIVE DELEGATION AT SPACE ACTION HAVE. YEAH ALRIGHT. OKAY ALTHOUGH THROUGH HISTORY. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. BUT THIS IS SURROUND THE OTHER THING I'D SAY ABOUT NASA. SO WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT. THIS REVOLUTION WITH SMALL SATELLITES AND COMMERCIAL SMALL SATELLITES AND. THE VENTURE CAPITALISTS AND THAT NOW THERE'S ACCESS TO SPACE EXPLOITATION FROM UNIVERSITIES AND HIGH SCHOOLS AND. BECAUSE YOU CAN BUILD THE SATELLITES WITH COMMERCIAL OFF THE SHELF PRODUCTS. FROM THE GOVERNMENT SIDE. BOTH NASA AND DEPARTMENT DEFENSE. ARE ALSO MAKING HUGE INVESTMENTS RIGHT NOW IN THE SMALL SATELLITE INDUSTRY. IN. THEY JUST LIKE THE COMMERCIAL MARKET THEY NEED ROCKETS THAT CAN LAUNCH THESE SMALL SETS AND. AND SO SOME OF THOSE ROCKETS REPRESENTED HERE. AT THE CALIFORNIA SPACEPORT I'M REPRESENTING THE OTHER COMPANIES THAT ARE STILL TRY TO DEVELOP THESE ROCKETS THAT WERE TRYING TO ATTRACT THEM TO LAUNCH FROM CALIFORNIA. AND DIED THERE WHILE THEY'RE WITH A PITCH TO THE VENTURE CAPITALIST IT'S MOSTLY THIS COMMERCIAL MARKET BUT THEY THEY ALL ARE BEING TOLD. ONCE YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL ONCE YOU PUT A FEW THINGS ON ORBIT. OF THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE GOING TO FALL RIGHT UP AND. SOURCE SONG I I SEE I SEE NASA PLAYING A HUGE ROLE IN. SMALL SAT LAUNCHES IN FUTURE TO. THAT ARE YOU DO MUCH COVERAGE WITH THE EUROPEAN SPACE. AUTHORITIES. OUR IS SO NOT US SPECIFICALLY BUT I WOULD REFER TO THE FAA ON OUR YEAH WE WE ARE DEATHLY COORDINATING WITH THAT THE PRAIRIES INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES ABOUT THEIR INTERESTS AND LAUNCHING FROM THEIR LOCATIONS AND THEY BRING IN THEIR SERVICE OVER HERE TO TO THE UNITED STATES AS WELL SO. THERE'S ONGOING CONVERSATION. WE'RE HAVING VISITORS COME. OVER TIME A HOBBY SPACEX VARIOUS COMPANIES. ARE VISITING AND SEE HOW THEY OPERATE TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT'S EXPECTED AND WHAT THE CURRENT REGIME IS. MARK I I AS I SAY I I DO APOLOGIZE FOR MISSING WASN'T HEARING AT THIS IS. PROBLEM WITH OUR LITTLE CITY SHARING YOUR COMMITTEE YEAH I THINK EVERYTHING ANDERSON. RIGHT. BUT I I DO LOOK FOR DIFFERENT MATERIALS THINKING YEAH I HAVE ONE CLOSING COMMENT JUSTICE TO SAY THAT WE RECOGNIZE. ISSUES AND CHALLENGES THAT THAT SOME OF THE COMPANIES ARE DEALING WITH NOW. SO IN OUR STREAMLINING EFFORT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES IN PARTICULAR. A SPACE PORT DOES COLOR CAVE AIRPORT. LAUNCHING AT VARIOUS SITES. ON THE FEDERAL RANGE FIRST IS THE THE NOT ARRANGE REGIME WOULD FIND IT MERGE THOSE TOGETHER MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT. AND WORKING MORE STREAM I PUT THE DIFFERENT COMPANIES. OKAY CHILEAN WORK IRATE AND. NO I I THINK I CAN I CAN SAY AS A. THE ACTING CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE THAT YOU KNOWN WHERE ON. WERE. I AM OPEN TO HEARING SPECIFIC IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN STREAMLINE. SOME OF THE. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA OF COURSE WERE VERY PROUD OVER VERY PROTECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA'S. YOU KNOW LEADERSHIP ROLE AND. ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY BETA. IF THERE STREAMLINING MEASURES THAT MAKE SENSE. I'M ALL EARS. NARRATOR. IF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EVERYONE FOR COMING OUT THING YOU KNOW THAT WE GOT CA MTA ALSO IN THE HOUSE. THANK YOU MISTER SHAW FOR. FOR SITTING THROUGH THE WHOLE PRESENTATION AND. I THINK WHERE GENTRA OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
