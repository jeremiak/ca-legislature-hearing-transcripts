THE HOWEVER DOES IN MANY OF THESE OTHER THINGS THE FINDINGS RELATED TO IT WAS PASSED IN THE PRIMARY BUDGET BILL THAT WE HAVE ALREADY ACTED ON.

AND AMENDS THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL AUTHORIZES THE FULL AMOUNT OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND THAT'S CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO BE ACCELERATED TO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FOR. FIRE PREVENTION AND FOREST RESILIENCE- SHOULD CIRCUMSTANCES NECESSITATE THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THIS ALSO INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING TO BE PROVIDED TO COUNTIES FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE GUBERNATORIAL RECALL ELECTION FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY THREE. POINT SIX MILLION- REFLECTING THE REVISED COST ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO THE LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR AND SECRETARY OF STATE ON JULY ONE OUT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- PURSUANT TO STATUTE. THIS BILL SPECIFIES THAT FIFTEEN MILLION APPROPRIATED TO THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY SHALL BE AVAILABLE FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS. AND LASTLY THIS BILL MAKES TECHNICAL AND CLARIFYING CHANGES TO VARIOUS ITEMS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT RELATED TO HIGHER EDUCATION. AND ADULT EDUCATION ISSUES- WE ARE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS NOW. ALL RIGHT LET'S SEE IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS LOOKS LIKE SENATOR DOLLY. AND THEN SENATOR NIELSEN WELL ACTUALLY SENATOR NELSON PLEASE. YOU TAKE PRECEDENT AS OUR VICE CHAIR GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- I JUST. WHAT WE ARE BEING PRESENTED WITH HERE TODAY ARE. SOME POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS I WOULD CONSIDER THEM. IT IS A BLESSING TO HAVE A YEAR WHERE WE'RE NOT FACED WITH SUCH ENORMOUS DEFICITS TO CONTEND WITH. THERE IS ALSO A YEAR TO BE WARY OF THE FUTURE. AS WE HAVE THIS LEGISLATURE IN YEARS PAST GOTTEN IN TROUBLE BY. HAVING SURPLUSES OR EXTRA REVENUE AND THEN SPENDING IT AND BASE BUILDING WAYS THAT APPLY JUST INTO THE FUTURE WONDER IF TRYING REVENUES HIT THE STATE THEN WE WERE IN BIG TROUBLE. WELL THAT MAY BE SOMETHING WE NEED TO BE WARY OF I THINK WE SURELY MUST. AT AND I THINK THAT THERE'S GOOD CAUSE IN BOTH BILLS TO BE SUPPORTIVE. BUT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS. IN THIS PARTICULAR ONE. THOSE OF US AND THAT MEANS PROBABLY MOST OF THE LEGISLATURE. WHO FACE DANGER OF THE FIRES. I THINK SHOULD BE WORRIED. A LOT OF MONEY IN HERE UP TO HALF A BILLION DOLLARS FROM OF WHICH IS ALREADY THERE FRESH. BUT A RECENT DEVELOPMENT GOOD CAUSE FOR CONCERN. PUBLIC STATION. GET A ANALYSIS OF PREVIOUS FIRE PREVENTION FUNDS THAT WE HAD ALLOCATED. WHEN IT CAME TO PASS THAT THE FUNDS WERE NOT EXPENDED. ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS BY THE PUBLIC STATION. CREATED QUITE A FUROR MOST ASSUREDLY TO THOSE OF US WHO FIERCELY LOST. IN THE LAST FIVE. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE- VERY ABLE AND LONG TERM YOU'RE. DIRECTOR OF CAL FIRE I HAD TO TAKE. IF YOU WILL THE HEAT. FOR THIS. AND AS WE LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR BILL. IT REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER THAT NINETY EIGHT NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED OR NOT. I WANT TO ALLOW THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. THAT AUTHORITY. I WOULD RATHER SEE THE LEGISLATURE PROSCRIBED. AND THEN BE ABLE TO SEE- RECORD REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE. TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT. SHOW WE DO NOT HAVE THE SITUATION. THAT WE MOST RECENTLY FACED. ADVISOR AND PREVENTION EFFORTS. DO NOT NEED TO BE THE BEST TIME IS NOT DURING THE SUMMER OF THE WAR MUCH. IF THE OTHER PART OF THE YEAR. WHEN YOU CAN HARVEST OR CLEAN OUT THAT FUEL WHAT DO THE PREVENTIVE STAFF. IT'S ALSO COMFORTING TO SOME OF US TO KNOW THE LOCAL FIRE STRAIGHT FOR FLORIDA YOU SHOULD FOR EXAMPLE. THEY ARE LOCAL PEOPLE- EXPEND THE MONEY IS VERY RESPONSIBLE WAYS. AND I FEAR THE RECORDING THE ADMINISTRATION THE AUTHORITY WE MAY SEE WHAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED HERE IN THE PAST. BUILDING SOME OF THAT MONEY OUT THE FIVE OH ONE SEE THREE CORPORATIONS THAT. I HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS. ABOUT WHAT MAINTAINING AND MANAGING FORESTS AND WILDLANDS. THEY ENTAIL. DOT THERE IS A DOWNSIDE. AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD. BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT. LITTLE EXPENDITURE HERE RELATED TO AN ELECTION COMING UP TO THAT- WE'VE GOT A RECOMPENSE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT IT ALSO DOES SPEAK TO A LITTLE BIT OF MANIPULATION FORTY FOUR TO A DISADVANTAGE. AND THAT IS OF CONCERN AS WELL. THAT SHARED THERE ARE OTHER PROVISIONS THAT I'LL SPEAK TO AS WE PROCEED. CHARTER SCHOOLS WILL BE SOMETHING I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT IN THE FUTURE MADAM CHAIRMAN. I AM GOING TO- LATELY BUT IF THAT THANK. THANK YOU BYE SURE NIELSEN US SENATOR ALI. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR ELLIE- SO WE THE SENATOR FROM- WELL LET'S SEE.

THE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED AS PART OF EARLY ACTION EARLIER THIS YEAR. THANK YOU THE LET ME HELP YOU OUT WITH A LITTLE BIT- THE SENATOR FROM SANTA CRUZ AND I ASKED IN THE BUDGET HEARING. IF WE COULD WE WANTED A PERCENTAGE TO GO TO. FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND R. C. D.'S WHO PEOPLE HAVE. SHOVEL READY JOBS THE CONSERVANCY'S WHO ARE IN THIS WORK ALL THE TIME SO I WANT TO SHARE FIRST OF ALL IN THIS BUDGET WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. HALF A MILLION OR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I BELIEVE PROPOSED AND I WANT TO KNOW. I DON'T WORRY WE HAVE CONTRACTORS READY TO WORK LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE I JUST. CALLED MY LOCAL THIS IS IN BEAVER. OUR CD AND I ASKED THE END THEY THEY WORK WITH THE FIRE SAFE COUNCIL THEY WORK WITH THE TRIBES THEY WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEY WORK WITH ALL INTERESTED PARTIES TO DO. PROJECTS SO THEY DID GET SOME PROPER PROJECTS FUNDED THEY HIT THEY GOT LIKE FIVE OR SIX MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE PROJECTS FUNDED BUT- SHASTA COUNTY CROSSROADS FOREST HEALTH NEEDS ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND. NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS. WELLINGTON FUEL BREAK FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SOLDIER MOUNTAIN WE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION. SIX Q. COUNTY WHERE WE HAVE THE LAB A FIRE GOING RIGHT NOW.

TODAY WITH LICE'S TIMBER OPERATOR'S LICENSE FORSTER'S ALL THE SEQUEL- EVERYTHING'S READY TO GO SO I WANT TO KNOW. IN THIS BUDGET ARE WE GONNA FUND THESE PROJECTS THAT'S JUST ONE FIRE SAFE COUNCIL.

IN PLASTER THEY'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT THERE'S PROFIT SHOVEL READY PROJECTS MY CONSERVANCY'S HERE ABOUT A CONSERVANCY ALLOCATED THE FUNDS AND THEY ALSO TOLD THE PHARMACY CLOSES TO PARE BACK BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. THAT'S B. S. THE MONEY IS HERE WE NEED TO GET IT TO THE PEOPLE. THAT ARE READY TO SPEND THE MONEY I'M I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT I WANT THE MONEY TO GET TO THE GROUND. THE FOR THE CAL FIRE FIREFIGHTERS ARE FIGHTING FIRE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT DOING. MOVIE PROJECTS. WE HAVE CONTRACTORS IN PEOPLE READY TO DO IT LET'S PUT THE MONEY IN AND DO IT AND QUIT. RUNNING AROUND BACK AND FORTH WHATEVER I'M TELLING YOU I'M GONNA GET THE FULL LIST FROM MY DISTRICT AND I'M GONNA KEEP HAPPENING UNTIL WE- FIND THESE PROJECTS. CALIFORNIANS DESERVE BETTER. AND WE'RE NOT GETTING IT THROUGH WHATEVER PROCESS IS GOING ON HERE THE MONEY WAS IN THE MONIES OUT WELL THERE'S MONEY NEEDED AND THEY'RE READY TO GO SO PLEASE. GET THE MONEY TO THE GROUND. LET ME CALL ON SENATOR LAYERED AND THEN SENATOR Y. CASKEY IS YOUR IS YOUR- MY COMPULSIVE SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YES AND I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO FINANCE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A RESPONSE HERE YOU WANT WELL SINCE I WAS A REFERRED TO BY MY ABLE AND DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER- I DID. IT AT THE JANUARY BUDGET HEARING ASKED THE FIRST QUESTION AND IT WAS ALL OF THE FIRE MONEY THAT WAS PROPOSED. WHAT PERCENT WOULD GO LOCAL AND NOT TO STATE AGENCIES AND ONCE WE GOT THE ANSWER BACK OUT OF. THE HEARING. IT WAS 86% AND I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT'S IN THIS BILL BUT IF IT'S ANYWHERE NEAR THAT. MY GOAL WAS THAT IT MEETS EXACTLY THE GOALTHAT WAS EXPRESSED BY THE SENATOR FROM BEAVER. THAT IT'S NOT JUST STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE THE SKILL AND ON OUR ON THE GROUND AND THE ABILITY TO DO THIS. AND WE HAVE THIS PROBLEM WHICH I AM TRYING TO ADDRESS LEGISLATIVELY. WHICH IS THAT WHILE THE RESOURCES AGENCY IN THE ADMINISTRATION MIGHT SAY HERE'S OUR FIVE YEAR GOALS. ALL WE SEE IS WHAT GOES IN THE BUDGET IN ONE YEAR- A AND WE DON'T SEE HOW IT ADDS TOGETHER WHAT THE GOALS ARE WHAT IT DOES OVER A FIVE YEAR TEN YEAR PERIOD. AND SO. I HAVE A BUILD OUT OF ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES THIS MORNING EVERYBODY ON THIS FLOOR VOTED FOR. THAT BASICALLY SAYS WE'LL TAKE THOSE GOALS. WILL PUT THEM IN THE STATUTE OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD BUT WE WILL ALSO. SET UP A MECHANISM BY WHICH IN A TRANSPARENT WAY WE MEASURE. WHAT IS DONE AGAINST EACH OF THOSE THOSE GOALS IF YOU HAVE A BOWL. OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES TO BE TREATED WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE. IT WILL ACTUALLY. SAY THIS IS HOW MANY ACRES WERE DONE IN A YEAR THEY'LL SET UP. A WORKING GROUP THAT WILL LOOK AT THIS AND SAY WE'RE BETTER FIT TO DO THIS WE SHOULD START TO MOVE INTO THIS DIRECTION. AND SO. THAT MEANS THAT THIS BUDGET ITEM IN FRONT OF US HAS A CONTEXT. IT HAS A CONTEXT BECAUSE IT'S PART OF THOSE GOALS. IF IT IS TRUE TO WHAT WAS SAID TO US OUT OF THE HEARING IN THE FIRST HEARING A LOT OF IT GOES LOCAL. AND THEN IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A MECHANISM TO ACCURATELY MEASURE SO THAT IF IT'S NOT GETTING TO CERTAIN-PLACES OR WE HAVE A GOAL OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES AND SOMEHOW IT GOT TO A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND. WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND HOW WE ADJUST SO I THINK THAT THIS BUDGET APPROPRIATION IS REALLY APPROPRIATE. BUT BUT IT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE TO. PARSE IT UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WORK GOES HOPE IT MEETS A LOT OF A LOCAL NEEDS AND MEASURE IT AGAINST THE GOALS SO THAT WE KNOW THAT OVER TIME WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING. THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO- WITH PLEASURE SUPPORT THIS BUT THERE IS A LARGER CONTEXT. THANK YOU SENATOR ALERT SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING INTO TROUBLE MAN FROM THE COUNTY OF TO HAMMER THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE COUNTY OF LASSEN THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ HAS SAIDTHE ARCHITECTURE THAT. WAS CREATED WITH THE EARLY ACTION FIRE ACTION WHICH INCLUDED A QUARTER OF A MILLION MORE DOLLARS THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAD SAID THIS SENATE. DESIGNED AT A EARLY ACTION PLAN SO WE CAN GET MONEY OUT THE DOOR FOR THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS BUT ALSO FOR THE PARKS THERE IS NINETY THOUSAND NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN FOR PARK DISTRICT WHICH MANAGE A LOT OF LAND THAT SOME FORCE THE SAME. THING WITH THE FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE WE HAVEN'T DONE A GOOD JOB OF GIVING MONEY TO THE FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE WE SPECIFICALLY IN THE EARLY ACTION PLAN PUT IN MONEY FOR THE CONSERVANCY'S WE NAME THE CONSERVANCY'S AND SAID WE WANT THIS. EARLY ACTION WILDFIRE MONEY TO BE SPENT BECAUSE WE WERE IN MARCH AND WE'RE HOPING TO GET. AND WE DIDN'T ALWAYS GIVE YOUR TRUCK HERE AND I WAS GONNA BE THE FIRE SEASON WAS GONNA START SO EARLY. FOR THAT MARKET WAS THERE WHEN THE COMMITTEE THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN THE THIS COMMITTEE ON THE WHOLE ARE THE ACTION THAT WE TOOK WAS FOR A FIVE YEAR PLAN. WE ARE RECOMMENDATION FROM SUB TWO WAS FOR A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR FIVE YEAR PLAN SO THERE WAS A HALF A BILLION. EARLY ACTION IN AND OUT THIS YEAR IT WAS FOR FIVE BILLION THIS. THE FIRST ACTION THAT WE TOOK ON A BUDGET DELAYED SOME OF THAT MONEY IT WAS ONLY THERE WAS. TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND OR THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EXTRA SO THIS THIS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION BRINGS US BACK UP TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THAT THAT THE SENATE HAS TAKEN SO WE'RE LOOKING AT. NEARLY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN FIRE PREVENTION BEINGS SPENT. YES FOR COMPARISON THE PEOPLE WHO DR LAURA WHO'S WRITTEN ON THIS AND ADVISE THAT THE SCENT THEY'RE TALKING A TEN YEAR INVESTMENT AT TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR WE'RE STILL SHORT. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT SOME OF TE SCIENTISTS ARE SAYING THAT WHAT WE NEED BUT THE- BUT THE ARCHITECTURE WAS TO GIVE THESE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS THEIR MONEY IN. I SUPPORT I HOPE EVERYBODY GOES BACK TO THEIR DISTRICTS AND FINDS OUT THE LOCAL MONEY THAT THAT WE SHOULD USE AND HOW MUCH MORE THAT THEY THEY GOT BUT THAT'S- THAT'S THE IDEA IS. AND I'M CONCERNED THAT FINANCE HAVING THE FILE- TAKE THEIR STUFF LIKE THAT BUT WHAT IT'S SAYING IS THAT IN THIS BUDGET YEAR. IF WE CAN FIND FOLKS TO DO THE WORK AND TO GET SOME OF THE FUEL CELL. THERE'S MONEY IN THE SENATE BILL AGAIN. THE FINAL FINAL HASN'T BEEN. I ENTERED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE N. N. THE ASSEMBLY ON HOW EACH OF THE CATEGORIES WE- HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT ALL THESE. YOU KNOW WE HAVE MONEY FOR BIOMASS WORD FOR TRANSPORTATION OF GET SOME OF THE FUEL OUT OF THE FORCE SO. IT'S A BEAR AND THIS. FOR THE CONSERVANCY'S IN THE AGENCIES AND THE LOCAL DISTRICTS THAT THAT HAVE THE NEED THE DESIRES THAT WE GET IT OUT IMMEDIATELY AND I SEE IMMEDIATELY MEMBER THE FISCAL YEAR JUST STARTED SO SOME OF THIS MONEY MAY THE PLANNING DOLLARS WILL BE OUT IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER SO THE WORK INDEED BE DONE AS SOON AS THE- AREAS- PREVAILED PULL FOR THAT SO THAT'S THE IDEA AND THEN WE COME BACK NEXT. NEXT YEAR AND YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT I WILL RE UP THE FIVE YEAR PLAN SO THAT WE CAN DO THIS SO ALL THE PLAYERS. IT THEY'RE DOING FIRE PREVENTION KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT ONE AND DONE THAT WE'RE LOOKING LONG TERM. WHAT THAT OCCURRED TO HAVE A- THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU- SENATORS FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOUR COMMENTS I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT THERE IS ONE POINT CLOSE TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET BILL WHICH DOES INCLUDE THE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION FOR EARLY ACTION- B. AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION THAT WAS THAT INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION. THEY DID R. F. FINDS. THEIR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IN THE CURRENT YEAR SORRY IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THEN AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WAS PROGRAMMED INTO BITE YOUR PLUS ONE AND THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. IS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS BEING ACCELERATED INTO THE BUDGET YEAR- SHOULD THE NEED ARISE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS IN REGARDS TO THE NUMBER OF LOCAL PROJECTS THAT- ARE. ARE ARE READY TO GO- REALLY JUST AS- THE IDEA WAS TO FACE IT BECAUSE- SORT OF OPERATIONAL ICING IT BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT IF THERE IS A NEED IN THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THAT WE WANT TO MAKE THOSE FUNDS AVAILABLE SO AGAIN CLOSE TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND THAT IS A SUBSET OF THE TWO POINT TWO BILLION- THAT'S PART OF A LARGER WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND ALL HAZARD EMERGENCY RESPONSE- THAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET BILL SO AGAIN UNDERSCORING THAT THERE THERE ARE DOLLARS AVAILABLE- AND THEN WE WILL THE STATE DEPARTMENTS WILL BE WORKING WITH LOCALS. TO FUND THOSE- LOCAL PROJECTS. THANK YOU. SENATOR MENENDEZ THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR- I YOU KNOW I THINK THE SENATORS WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME- DID A FINE JOB OF POINTING OUT SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE ALL HAVE WITH THIS BILL RELATING TO FIRE SAFETY AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO DIG A LITTLE DEEPER ON THIS I KNOW SHE WAS JUST ON- BUT- IF. IF FINANCE IS GOING TO BE THE ULTIMATE ARBITER OF WHETHER OR NOT THESE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED THEN I THINK. THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED WITH RESPECT TO THE PROJECTS THAT ARE READY TO GO IN DISTRICTS THAT STILL HAVEN'T BEEN FUNDED AND THAT. INCLUDES PROJECTS IN MY DISTRICT IN PROBABLY IN MANY OF THE MEMBERS DISTRICTS IN THIS COMMITTEE HEARING- YOU KNOW I THINK THE PEOPLE ARE THERE WHO ARE READY AND WILLING AND ABLE TO. WORK ON THESE JOBS IN THE FUNDING IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE BUT WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE FIGHTING I KNOW. DEPARTMENT FINANCES SAID IN THE PAST THAT. THE FINDING WAS IT NEEDED BECAUSE THERE IS A BOTTLENECK. OF FINDING ALREADY BUT MEANWHILE WE ARE IN OUR DISTRICTS YOU KNOW BEGGING FOR THIS MONEY. TO GET THESE PROJECTS DONE MAKE SURE COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE IN THE MONEY ISN'T TRICKLING DOWN TO OUR LEVEL AND GETTING THESE PROJECTS DONE SO IF YOU. WOULDN'T MIND- ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO TALK ABOUT. HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THATTHIS MONEY DOES GET TO WHERE IT IS NEEDED I WOULD APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YOU'RE WELCOME DEPARTMENT FINANCE YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION CENTER MELINDA'S I WILL TURN OVER IT- TO MY- COLLEAGUE SERGIO ANGULAR FOR THE DETAILS. HEY CANCER DRIVER PART OF FINANCE SO I THINK I'LL JUST GO TO A COUPLE THINGS I THINK AS A- THE TREND. THAT THEY CATEGORIZE ATION OF HOW THE MONEY WOULD BE SPENT- ACTUALLY HASN'T BEEN DECIDED YET SO THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT AS PART OF. OUR SUMMER DISCUSSION WITH THE LEGISLATURE WILL ACTUALLY BE DETERMINING- PROGRAMMATIC LEE- KIND OF HARD TO CATEGORICALLY SPEND THE DIFFERENT FUNDING THAT IS ALLOCATED FOR. THE BUDGET YEAR AND THEN THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FUNDING THAT AND THIS BILL WE'RE PROPOSING TO ACCELERATE. SO ONCE- THOSE CATEGORIES ARE ARE DECIDED. BY THAT. IS THE BUDGET YOU'RE FUNNY THAT WE WOULD INCLUDE A DEFINITE KIND OF FOCUSING ON ON KIND OF HIGH PRIORITY OF FIRE AREAS AND TO EXTEND THOSE DOLLARS ARE GETTING OUT QUICKLY. AND THEN THERE'S A NEED TO AUTHORIZE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO BE SPENT IN THE BUDGET YEAR THAT'S WHEN WE WOULD TRIGGER THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THOSE SPECIFIC CATEGORIES. THAT WILL BE DECIDED- ULTIMATELY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. SENATOR DOLE YOU RIDE YOUR BIKE A- SENATOR MELINDA SHE WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE QUESTION GO AHEAD I DO I JUST HAVE A FOLLOW UP THANK YOU- MY APOLOGY SENATOR DOLLY BUT I JUST. WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT BECAUSE- I. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHEN. IS THIS GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THE NEED IS THERE NO WORD ENTIRE CITIES ARE PRACTICALLY EMPIRE SEASON. YEAR ROUND SO. TO BE GIVEN AN EXPLANATION THAT WE'RE WORKING ON- THE MECHANICS OF THIS IS. FRIGHTENING TO SOME OF US WHO HAVE AREAS OF OUR DISTRICT ARE EXTREMELY- HI FIRES AND SO. E COULD YOU PERHAPS ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THE- THE TIME LINE I MEAN THE TIME IS NOW IN THE TIME LINE TO ME SEEMS. REALLY STRETCHED OUT. YEAH SO IN TERMS OF FUNDING AVAILABLE NOW SO THE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS ADOPTED AS PART OF EARLY ACTION. THAT'S SOMETHING CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENTS THAT WERE PART OF THAT- WALL FIRE PREVENTION OF COURSE REALLY IT'S LAND ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON ALLOCATING. AND NOW THE DIVISIONAL FUNDS THAT ARE IN THIS BUDGET. SO THOSE AREN'T AVAILABLE UNTIL WE DO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO PROGRAMMATIC WE ALLOCATE. BUT THERE IS AN EXISTING DOLLAR AMOUNT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR APPROVED EARLIER THIS YEAR AND THAT CURRENTLY IS- BEING BEING ALLOCATEDACROSS THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS. THAT ALIGN WITH THE CATEGORIES THAT WERE APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. SENATOR ALI. THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME- SO THE QUESTION TO ME IS FOR ME THEN. WITH THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDS. IF LET'S SY FOR EXISTENCE CAL FIRE CAN'T WHICH WE'VE HEARD I MEAN THAT THEY THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESEARCH DIDN'T HAVE THE PERSONNEL TO GET TO THE MONEY OUT. IF THAT'S THE CASE THESE EXTRA FUNDS HOW DO WE GET THOSE RESOURCES TO. THE SIERRA NEVADA CONSERVANCY WHO HAS THE PEOPLE TO EXPAND THE MONEY TO THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS TO THE R. C. D.'S. WHAT'S THE PROCESS THAT THIS THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE THAT MONEY TO PLACES WHERE WE CAN SPEND. YES I JUST LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE OF THE EARLY ACTION SO I WILL NOTED EARLIER THE EARLY ACTION DID INCLUDE SPECIFIC FUNDING CALL FOR CONSERVANCIES- THAT DID ALLOCATE. HOURS ARE BEGINNING TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN YOU. AND SO WHEN WE ALLOCATE THE FUNDING- THAT IS INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET WILL REFLECT THAT YOUR DIRECT PROGRAMMATIC LEE CATEGORIZED ALLOCATE THE FUNDING. TO THE EXTENT THERE IS A SPECIFIC CONSERVANCY- OCCASION JUST LIKE THERE WAS IN IN THE EARLY ACTION I THINK THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE THE KIND OF. THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD GO TOWARDS A DIFFERENT PROJECTS BUT THOSE DETAILS I THINK ON THE FUNDING IN THIS SPECIFIC BUDGET- THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE DISCUSSED- YOU KNOW OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. BUT THE BY THIRTY SIX MILLION THAT WAS IN EARLY ACTION. IT ACTUALLY INCLUDES FUNDING FOR CONSERVANCY SPECIFICALLY TO GET THOSE PROJECTS ON GROUND. RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THAT. I UNDERSTAND IT WE ALLOCATED I SAID ON SEPT TWO. I UNDERSTAND THAT WE ALLOCATED THE RESOURCES TO THOSE CONSERVANCY'S. AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE THEY'VE USED THAT MONEY. WE NEED TO REPLENISH THAT NOW WITH THIS POT. IS IT WORTH IT FOR THE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN ELECTED. WE'RE ALWAYS USUALLY TRYING TO FIND MONEY. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SPEND IT. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO ME THAT WE CAN'T. FIGURE OUT THAT. THE CONSERVATIVES KNOW HOW TO SPEND IT THE R. C. D.'S NOT TO SPEND IT BUT CAL FIRE IS BUSY FIGHTING FIRE RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T HAVE THE- RESOURCES OR THEY DON'T HAVE THE KNOW HOW. TO GET THIS MONEY OUT TO THE GROUND SO MY QUESTION TO YOU. IS I KNOW WE DIDN'T HEAR ANY ACTION I SAID ON THE- SUB TO COMMITTEE WHEN WE ALLOCATED THE RESOURCES. I WANT TO KNOW HOW TO TAKE THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCE WE'RE GONNA VOTE ON TODAY. AND GET THEM TO THE PLACES THAT KNOW HOW TO SPEND MONEY. THEN PROJECTS ARE AVAILABLE. IT IT MAYBE I'M TALKING TO THE WRONG PEOPLE BUT I DON'T HAVE AN ACT I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND ADMINISTRATION TO GET IT DONE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THESE PROJECTS DONE IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT WE HAVE THIS MONEY AND WE CAN'T GET IT TO THE GROUND. SO WHAT'S THE PROCESS. SO FOR THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE OVER THIS SUMMER. MEDICALLY ALLOCATE THAT FUNDING AND SO AS PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND A FUTURE BUDGET BUILDING HERE THAT WAS AN APPROPRIATE THOSE DOLLARS THAT'S WHEN WE WOULD CATEGORIZE DOLLARS AND SIX AND THERE'S ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO GET CATEGORIZED FOR THE CONSERVANCY'S. AND THAT'S WHERE THAT FUNDING WOULD BE AVAILABLE. THANK YOU ON MY OWN TIME I MAY SUGGEST INTO THIS. BUDGET COMMITTEE. THAT WE FIGURE OUT NOT THROUGH THE SUMMER WE HAVE FIRES GOING ON WE HAVE PROJECTS. I'VE IDENTIFIED THE NEED FINDING HOW WE CAN GET THAT DONE SOONER THAN LATER SO I'LL DEFER TO. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS BUT I WILL BE WATCHING THIS AND I WILL BRING YOU A LIST OF PROJECTS CONTINUALLY. AND AS ONE THING AS A AS A- MAYBE RARE BUT I ACTUALLY FOLLOW UP AND GET IN THE WEEDS AND GO TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY NEED AND THIS IS A NEED THAT THEY NEED. THIS WOULD WILL HELP NOT JUST MY DISTRICT WILL HELP A LOT OF COMPANY THERE'S- AND THERE'S THE PARKS THERE'S ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROJECTS READY AND WE SHOULD FIND THEM. NOT THIS FALL BUT RIGHT NOW SO. WE CAN GET IT DONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YOU'RE WELCOME SENATOR DOLLY SENATOR NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THESE BILLS WERE REFERRED TO THE LEGISLATURE NOW APPROPRIATING. BY THE STATUTE. BUT THE MONEY. WILL BE DETERMINED TO THE DEGREE THAT IT GOES OUT. BUT I UNDERSTAND IT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE WEATHER OR NOT. WHICH WOULD INPUT NOT ON FIRE BUT IT IT SPECIFICALLY EMPOWERS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT WELL WE'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND THAT MONEY RIGHT NOW. WE'LL SPEND IT SOME OTHER TIME. I FEEL RELUCTANT. TO GIVE OUT THAT AUTHORITY TO THEM TO DO SO. BECAUSE FRANKLY THERE'S THE ELEMENT OF TRUST HERE. AND WE HAVE BECAUSE NOT TO BE TRUSTED. I WOULD LIKE TO DIRECTLY ASK FINANCE WHAT IS GOING TO BE YOUR CRITERIA WHAT ARE YOUR BENCHMARKS TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL MONEY. TO GO OUT TO THAT UP TO A BILLION DOLLARS. WHAT IS YOUR CRITERIA NOW YOU TALK ABOUT TALKING TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND WE KNOW WHO THAT NEW AGE. IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT REPORTING. TO THE LEGISLATURE. WHICH IS. THAT'S THE LEAST EFFECTIVE THING WE GET AROUND TO IT SOMETIME AND SAY HEY THIS IS WHAT WE DECIDED TO DO. AFTER THE FACT. COULD BE WELL AFTER WE ADJOURN WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO. THE PRESSURE ON THE DEPARTMENT TO SPEND ALL THE AGENCY. TO SPEND. PHIL AS WE CONTEMPLATE THIS AUTHORITY BEING ACCORDED TO FINANCE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF HOW MUCH OF THE MONEY. WILL BE APPORTIONED AND PERCENT OUT. WHAT IS YOUR CRITERIA I'M SENATOR NELSON IF I CAN INTERJECT THIS- THE BILL BEFORE US DOES NOT GIVE THEM THE- CARTE BLANCHE AUTHORITY. RATHER IT IS A BUDGET BILL JUNIOR THAT- PREACHED THE FINDING AND AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE'S EXPLAINED. WE ARE WE WILL TAKE A SUBSEQUENT ACTION THAT DETAILS OUT HOW THE SPENDING IS AS WE DID IN THE EARLY ACTION ON THE FIRST SET OF FUNDS SO- I EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE TAKING ACTION MEANING THE LEGISLATURE TO DIRECT THESE THE DIFFERENT PARTS AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST AND WHAT I HEAR FROM THE VARIOUS COMMENTS. OF THE MEMBERS HAVE SPOKEN IS THAT THEY'RE HOPING THAT WE WOULD DO THAT- WE WOULD EXPEDITE THAT PROCESS. SHOW THIS IS SUBJECT DOWN TO THE APPROVAL BY THE LEGISLATURE TO STATUTE. PERHAPS CANNOT MAKE ITS OWN UNILATERAL DECISION SAY WELL WE'RE ONLY GOING TO SPEND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. THEY HAVE TO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND GET OUR APPROVAL. FOR THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS AND THEN THE MONEY WILL GO OUT YOU WILL TAKE AS I INDICATED THE SUBSEQUENT ACTION WHICH DETAILS OUT THE FUNDING BUCKETS FOR THIS MONEY AS WE DID IN THE EARLY ACTION. WELL I'LL JUST ECHO MY COLLEAGUES' COMMENTS SHOULD THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE ADVISED MANY OF US ARE GONNA BE WATCHING THIS VERY CAREFULLY. AND WILL BE VERY VOCAL ABOUT IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY DOES GET TO THE PARTIES IN THE AREAS MOST AFFECTED. AND ENOUGH DEFECTIVE USE OF THOSE DOLLARS WE DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND HERE NEXT YEAR SAYING OH GEE WE'VE GOT SOME MORE MONEY THAT WE DIDN'T SPEND LAST YEAR. THANK YOU. CERTAINLY ALL RIGHT LET'S SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON US SENATOR STERN GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I HOPE THE PUBLIC CAN ADD ONE BIT OF VALUE I THINK IT COLLOQUY IS BEEN. VERY USEFUL THUS FAR AND I APPRECIATE THE URGENCY OF FROM SUCH A DIVERSE- GROUP OF MEMBERS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE IN SUCH DIFFERENT REGIONS- THE URGENCY AND THE NEED- IN WILDFIRE SPENDING IN REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR- PUTTING FORWARD THIS FRAMEWORK AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I JUST WANT TO GET. ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION ON THE RECORD WHAT I HEARD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAY. IS THAT. REGIONAL DEMONSTRATIONS OF NEAT. THE ABILITY SORT OF IN THIS INTERIM PROCESS FOR THE LOCALS TO COME BACK AND DEMONSTRATE TO US INTO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THEIR NEED I WILL BE IN IN A CRITICAL FACTOR IN DETERMINING- THE FUTURE ALLOCATION STRATEGY DID I DID I HEAR THAT. CORRECTLY. TO OUR FRIENDS AT FINANCE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIRD DRIVE OUR CAR FINANCE- I THINK IT'S KIND OF AT A HIGH LEVEL JUST SUFFERED FROM THE CONTEXT TO. BUT IT'S BASED OFF OF THE WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE ACTION PLAN AND ONE OF THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE HIGHLIGHTED AS PART OF THAT STRATEGY IS CALLING FOR GOALS TO BE. ACHIEVED LARGELY THROUGH REGIONAL STRATEGY THA SO THAT IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE CATERPILLARS AND COMPONENT THAT WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE PLAN WHICH WAS THE BASIS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION- INITIAL WALL WALLS ARE VENTURES AND- SO IT IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE CRITERIA. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I WOULD JUST SAY I THINK THAT GIVES US ALL REALLY IMPORTANT HOMEWORK TO DO OVER THIS RECESS TO TAKE INVENTORY TO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND SAY. WHAT IS THAT NEED PUTTING PROPOSALS AND REAL INTEGRATED PROJECTS TOGETHER AT SCALE NOT JUST ONE OFF. PROJECTS HERE AND THERE BUT COMPREHENSIVE REGION SCALE AND- I KNOW IN OUR REGION DOWN IN LOS ANGELES AND HER COUNTIES WE'VE ALREADY. I SPENT DOWN ALL THE FUNDING HAS BEEN ALLOCATED FROM THE EARLY ACTION BUDGET SO I THINK THE NEED IS THERE BUT- I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND ALL OF THE LEADERSHIP HERE TO.

INCOME ELIGIBILITY. I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. I HEARD QUESTIONS ON THIS ONE- I SEE SENATOR NIELSEN'S MIKE UP SENATOR NIELSEN. SENATOR NELSON. YES MADAM CHAIR THE. THE DAY AFTER SCHOOL FOR THEM SPECIAL ED. BUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING AHEAD OF MYSELF IF. THE CONCERN I HAVE. SPEAKING TO THE PLUS THE PROCS. THE DEBT TO THE SCHOOLS IS NECESSARY THE SPECIAL ED CAREER TECH. THE ASSISTANCE FOR RECRUITING AND DEVELOPING OUR TEACHERS WHICH WE ALWAYS NEED TO DO MORE OF. THESE ARE PLUSES. BUT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS. ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOLS. CALIFORNIA. DANISH CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THEN A LIFESAVER. TO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. BUT TYPICALLY IN THE DISADVANTAGES OF DESTRUCTION. YOUR PARENTS HAVE SOUGHT THIS BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR THEIR CHILDREN. WHERE THE K. TWELVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS LET THEM DOWN. THERE'S GOING TO BE A PARENT MISSION STUDYING OF THIS AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT. STUDYING. BEAR FRUIT. AND THAT THE CONTINUED ATTACKS. ON CHARTER SCHOOLS. DOES NOT CONTINUE IN THIS BUDGET. THE FETTERS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT ON OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS. THAT ENSURE THAT THEY WOULD REMAIN AS MEDIOCRE. AS OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THAT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. ATTEMPT AND IT IS NOT AT ALL IN THE BEST INTEREST. OF OUR STUDENTS. PHIL I TAKE THE IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA. THE JURY MUST BE OUT. AND WHICH MUST MONITOR. AND KEEP AN EYE ON THE. AND I RETAIN SOME CONCERN. ABOUT THE. IF YOU WILL. LEVELING DOWN. A TEACHER COMPETENCE AND ABILITY- PRETTY MUCH DIMINISHED THE CASH THE- HAVE BEEN VERY IMPORTANT OVER THE YEARS TO MAINTAIN. TEACHERS ABILITY AND COMPETENCE. NOW WE HAVE A B. GRADE STANDARD. DID YOU GET A B. GRADE THAT **** YOU QUALIFIED. I'M NOT SO SURE. IT DOES THAT IS A SUFFICIENT MEASURE. FOR OUR TEACHERS. I'M MAKING THIS OBSERVATION RHETORICALLY BUT IT IS ONE THAT I THINK THE PUBLIC. SHOULD PAY HEED AND ATTENTION TO. WE ARE FAILING MISERABLY AND HAVE FOR DECADES IN MATH. EVEN SCIENCE THE THIRTY NINTH. IN ENGLISH. AND WE'RE PUTTING CHILDREN OUT INTO THE COMMUNITIES. I'M NOT EQUIPPED WITH THOSE LIFE SAVING TOOLS. AND WE DO NOT HAVE FISH AND FISH ON THAT CAPABILITY TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE FOR OUR TEACHERS AND THEN ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT COMPETENCY THOSE TEACHERS. WE'RE DOING A DISSERVICE. I PUT THIS OUT OF A BIT OF A WATCH. A RED FLAG FOR THE FUTURE. BUT WE SHOULD ALWAYS TREAT FOR OUR STUDENTS THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION NOT LEVEL DOWN. OR PUT A CAP ON IT BE THERE TO BE. OR SHE GREAT. LET ME CLOSE WITH A STORY. WHEN OUR OLDEST SON WAS. GETTING READY ALL MY OTHER CHILDREN GOING THROUGH PUBLIC SCHOOLS. BUT WHAT I CALL THE SECOND CROP. WHEN THE OLDEST WITH APPROACHING THE TIME TO ENROLL IN SCHOOL. TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE PRIVATE NOTION FIRST TIME WE'D EVER CONSIDERED PRIVATE. I WENT TO A PUBLIC MEETING. OR IN THAT DISTRICT WAS AN ENTERTAINING SOMETHING CALLED OUTCOME BASED EDUCATION. I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. ALCON BASED EDUCATION. WHAT IT WOULD MEAN THE DIRECT TEACHER CONTACT WITH OUR STUDENTS. AMONG OTHER THINGS. BUT THEN ONE OF THE TEACHERS GOT UP. AND BRAG. THE DISTRICT WAS GOING TO ADOPT A POLICY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO GRADE LESS THAN THREE. IN THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT. WITH OUR CHILDREN. I WAS IRATE AND I ROSE AND I SHED WE OWE IT TO OUR CHILDREN. THAT THEY MAY FAIL. BECAUSE WHAT DO YOU LEARN. IF EVERYBODY GETS A TROPHY IF EVERYBODY GETS TO SEE. IS THAT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF EXPECTATION. THAT WE HAVE FOR OUR STUDENTS THE STREET. AND WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT BY THAT DECISION. I SEE THAT JUST KIND OF HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND HERE WE SHOULD EVER BE WORRIED AND WARY OF LETTING THAT HAPPEN FURTHER. IN OUR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BUT SENATOR MELINDA IS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE- FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS- BUILD. ALLOCATED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION- OF ETHNIC STUDIES IN OUR SCHOOL IT'S BASED ON THE PASSAGE OF AB ONE A ONE A BILL WHICH IS STILL WINDING ITS WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT BEEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR IN EIGHTY ONE NO ONE MAKES FOR THOSE WHO DON'T RECALL MAYBE WANNA ONE MAKES ETHNIC STUDIES A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT IN CALIFORNIA IT DOESN'T MAKE THAT GRADUATION A REQUIREMENT. OF THE CLASS REQUIREMENT UNTIL THE YEAR 292-029-2030 IT'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO. I WOULD LIKE AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY WE HAVE ALLOCATED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET FOR SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE PLACE FOR ANOTHER EIGHT YEARS AND THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION IN THERE. FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT- I HAVE A COUPLE FOLLOW UP TO THAT BUT IF- THAT. QUESTION CAN BE ADDRESSED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GROUP YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I'LL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES- EITHER ERIN RADIO- OR BREANNA BRANDS THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIRMAN MAY I. CHRIS FERGUSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- ON THIS FIFTY MILLION IT IS SATISFIED CONTINGENT UPON THE PASSAGE OF THAT BILL- THIS SHOW CERTAINLY IS IT IS HELD IN RESERVE UNDER THE EXPECTATION THAT- YOU KNOW THERE WOULD BE A FURTHER CONVERSATION ADDS THAT BUILT. A WORKS THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. SO WE ARE ALLOCATING MONEY EIGHT YEARS IN ADVANCE. I THINK WE ARE ALLOCATING MONEY- UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE COULD BE SOME- PARTICULAR- YOU KNOW PIECE OF THE BILL BUT THAT WORK COULD BEGIN NOW. SHOULD THAT BE FINE. OR BE YOU KNOW ENROLLED OKAY- THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT SO THAT SOUNDS TO ME AS THOUGH- THE ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING TO OFFER SOME SORT OF CARROT. TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO START OFFERING- ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES NOW A MUCH SOONER THAN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY NINE TWENTY THIRTY- I DON'T I'M NOT AWARE THAT WE HAVE EVER. ALLOCATED MONEY FOR SOMETHING. EIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF TIME FOR A BILL THAT HASN'T EVEN BEEN SIGNED INTO LAW- BUT THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. IF I COULD ADD THAT THERE ARE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES THAT COULD OFFER THIS NOW EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. THANK YOU. SENATOR MAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF. OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND ALSO- MY COLLEAGUES FROM YUCAIPA AND FROM SANTA CRUZ FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE AND TO WORK ON THIS BUDGET BILL- I THINK THIS IS AN AMAZING- BUDGET AND IT WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO BE INVESTING IN A BIG WAY IN EDUCATION WHICH AS WE ALL KNOW. IS AT THE HEART OF OUR FUTURE AT THE HEART OF A SOCIOECONOMIC MOBILITY AT THE HEART OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. AND YOU KNOW JUST FOR STARTERS I I'M I'M REALLY GLAD TO SEE THAT THIS BUDGET PAYS DOWN THE DEFERRALS MADE A TICKET TO THE K. TO TWELVE SYSTEM AND INCREASES BASE FUNDING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- CHAIR LAYERED AND I REPEATEDLY EMPHASIZED. IN OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS IN OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND WHILE I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE MANY IMPORTANT PRIORITIES IN EDUCATION- INCLUDING MANY THAT ARE ADDRESSED IN THIS BUDGET. MY BELIEF IS THAT OUR TOP PRIORITY HAS TO BE CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN OUR BASIC K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION ACROSS THE BOARD AND I CAN ONLY BE DONE BY INCREASING OUR BASE BUDGETS INCREASING OUR INVESTMENTS IN L. C. S. F. N. PROP NINETY FUNDING. SO I'M GLAD TO SEE WE'RE DOING THAT I'M ALSO REALLY HEARTENED TO SEE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT. IN PLANNING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIVERSAL T. K. WHICH IS CRITICAL BY THE SCIENCE AND DATE ON THIS POINT OR CLEAR EARLY EDUCATION IS SO IMPORTANT FOR EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES THIS IS ANOTHER STRONG INVESTMENT IN OUR FUTURE IN OUR FUTURE ECONOMIC STRENGTH. THE ROBUSTNESS OF OUR SOCIETY INSTITUTIONS AND IT WILL ALL BE BETTER OFF BECAUSE OF THIS INVESTMENT I DO WANT TO RAISE THE CONCERNS BROUGHT BY MANY ABOUT UNIVERSAL T. K. THAT THIS MIGHT NOT BE SUSTAINABLE OVER THE LONG RUN THAT THIS MIGHT LEAD TO DIS INVESTMENTS IN K. THROUGH TWELVE IN CHILD CARE. WHILE THIS BUDGET DOES ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS TO A LARGE DEGREE BY MAKING LARGE INVESTMENTS K. THROUGH TWELVE PRESCHOOL KINDERGARTEN AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. MY BELIEF IS THAT IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE WATCH THIS CLOSELY OVER TIME- THE CONCERNS RAISED. HERE ARE LEGITIMATE AND I THINK THAT I AM GOING. OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING ARE GOING TO BE KEY PRIORITIES FOR. THIS BODY. TO ENSURE THAT UNIVERSAL T. K. OPERATES THE WAY THAT IS INTENDED THAT DOES NOT TAX SOME OF THE OTHER PRIORITIES IN EDUCATION. I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE INVESTMENTS IN TEACHER RETENTION RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING. IT COMING OUT A CODE WE KNOW THESE HAPPY TOP PRIORITIES AND I'M I'M REALLY HEARTENED TO SEE THAT THESE ARE PRIORITIES HERE- JUST A COUPLE MORE THINGS I WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT ABOUT THIS BUDGET WHICH IS AGAIN SOMETHING THAT I'M I'M- VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT. AND IT PLAYED A SMALL PART IN IN CREATING- ETHNIC STUDIES AN ANTI BIAS TRAINING RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN. THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AT A TIME WHEN WE SEE THAT HEY IS ON THE RISE. WHEN W SEE ANTI ASIAN HATE IN THE STATE ON THE RISE WHEN WE SEE ANTI SEMITIC ATTACKS ANTI AIR ATTACKS. WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE EDUCATION TO TRY TO COMBAT THIS ISSUE TO PROTECT AND EMPOWER OUR MINORITY YOUTH ARE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES- THERE'S ALSO MONEY IN THIS BUDGET TO INVEST IN A MODEL CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT PROCESS FOR VIETNAMESE AMERICAN. CAMBODIAN HMONG HISTORY AMONG OTHER CULTURES WHICH HAVE BEEN SHUT OUT A K. THROUGH TWELVE CURRICULUM FOR FAR TOO LONG SO I'M VERY VERY PLEASED TO SEE THESE PRIORITIZED- THESE DO MATTER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON'T SEE THEMSELVES IN OUR HISTORY BOOKS. IN IN THE WAY THAT SCHOOLS. TEACH IN THE STATE. I OF ENTRANCE IN PARTICULAR AND MY DISTRICT THE ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL. IN ADMINISTERING THE MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT- WHICH FOCUSES ON ALLEYS IMPLEMENTATION OF SOCIO ECONOMIC LEARNING. DRAMA SCREAMING AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT AFFIRMING AND SUSTAINING PRACTICES. AND I'M AGAIN HAPPY TO SEE THAT THIS BUDGET BILL. ALLOWS THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR WORK IN THE SPACE AND SERVE AS A MODEL FOR THE EMPTY SS. BUT OVERALL I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BUDGET IT STRIKES A GREAT BALANCE IN BALANCING OUR- SHORT TERM CORPORATE PRIORITIES AND THERE'S A LOT OF USE THEY'RE VERY DEMANDING. WITH THE NEED FOR LONG TERM INVESTMENTS WERE TAKING THE SURPLUS AND PUTTING A LOT OF IT INTO LONG TERM INVESTMENTS IN OUR FUTURE. AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN THESE INVESTMENTS RESPONSIBILITY SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AGAIN. TERMINATOR TWO. AS A SENATOR A TO A VOTE. AND THE STAFF FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK THIS REALLY IS AN INCREDIBLE BUDGET AND I'M VERY VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT. SENATOR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN IT I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE COMMON AND THE COMMENTS PARTICULARLY THAT FOR GLOBAL THAT WERE JUST MADE BY. THE SENATOR FROM VERMONT BUT FROM WHAT I WANTED TO DO IS JUST TALK AT A HIGH LEVEL ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL MEANS AND THIS IS ON TOP OF WHAT WE ALREADY DID AS PART OF THE BUDGET BECAUSE IT'S PART OF THE BUDGET ARE WE RESTORED THE PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING LEVELS TO WHERE THEY WERE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND THEN DID A FIVE POINT 7% COAL. WE ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME IMPLEMENTED THE RAINY DAY FUND WITH REGARD TO THE PROP NINETY EIGHT SO THERE'S GOING TO BE ROUGHLY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS AND SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT OVERALL- WE CAME BACK AND SURPASSED THE LEVELS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND WE HAVE THE FIRST RESERVE AN EDUCATION IN MODERN TIMES AND THAT IS THE BACKDROP FOR THIS TRAILER BILL- BECAUSE THIS TRAILER BILL AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT- WE'RE JUST MENTIONED I THINK ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS IS THAT- MAY REVISE DID NOT HAVE THE COMPLETE PAY OFF OF THE DEFERRALS. THIS BILL HAS THE COMPLETE PAY OFF OF THE DEFERRALS AND IT WAS ERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T PAY OFF DEBT WHEN WE'RE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF REVENUE IN ONE TIME MONEY IN HISTORY WHILE I WAIT TO HAVE A DOWNTURN AND HAVE IT COMPETE AGAINST THE RAINY DAY FUND. TRAILER BELOW THIS ALSO ALLOWS THE INDEPENDENT STUDY FOR STUDENTS WHOSE PARENTS OR GUARDIANS DETERMINED THAT IN PERSON'S INSTRUCTION WOULD PUT THE STUDENT AT RISK WE EXPECT STUDENTS TO RETURN TO SCHOOL IN THE FALL THAT IS OUR HOPE THAT IS THE GUIDANCE FROM THE LEGISLATURE BUT YES THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORRIED ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH THEY SHOULD HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE INEVITABLY WE WOULD BE FUNDING. ARE DECLINING ENROLLMENT IF WE PUSH THEM OUT OF THE SYSTEM WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH TROUBLE MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY COMES BACK IN PERSON ARE COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC AND SO IT GIVES AN ALTERNATIVE THAT MAKE SURE THAT EVERY STUDENTS NEEDS ARE MET- AS WE MOVE FORWARD THIS IMPLEMENTS THE UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS PROGRAM I CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW SIGNIFICANT THAT IS. BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND IN THE PANDEMIC AND BEFORE THAT FOOD IN SECURITY IS A MAJOR PART OF ISSUES IN THE SCHOOL BARRIERS IN SOME CASES TO LEARNING THIS ADDRESSES THAT AS WAS MENTIONED IT EXPANDS THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM AND IT DOES IT IN A WAY. THAT IT PRESERVES ALTERNATIVES FOR PARENTS- IN THIS FROM OTHER PROGRAMS THAT EXIST SO IT MEETS A GOAL ABOUT. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION BUT IN A WAY THAT WORKS FROM A MENU FOR THE PARENTS. IT ALSO AND AS WAS MENTIONED INCREASES THE VALUE OF THE CONCENTRATION GRANTS IT EXPANDS CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION EXPANDS THE VIDEOS OF THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR AFTER SCHOOL AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAT REALLY FOCUSES ON. ON ALL KIDS THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED CATEGORIES THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS AND IT INCREASES SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING BY EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. AND IT IS A TIME TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE WHILE THE SUN IS SHINING. BECAUSE I CAN'T DESCRIBE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE A ROUGH TIME CHOOSING BETWEEN THE COMMITMENT TO SPECIAL EDUCATION AND THE COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME DOES THAT SO WITH THE BACKDROP OF THE INCREASE FUNDING BACKDROP OF A CONTINUED PAY DOWN IN PERSON STORES. HI THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST BUDGET THAT WE WILL SEE FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION IN MODERN TIMES AND- WHILE THE QUESTIONS THAT GET ASKED IN THIS HEARING. ON SOME OF THE ONE TIME ITEMS OR TINGS THAT ARE IN THIS BUDGET ARE TOTALLY APPROPRIATE. AND TOTALLY DESERVING OF ATTENTION I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE MAJOR OUR PROGRESS THIS BUDGET REPRESENTS I STRONGLY WHEN WE GET TO IT VIRGIN I POSTED. THE THANK THE. CHAIR FOR THE ABILITY TO MAKE COMMENTS. THANK YOU SEPT. ONE SENATOR LAYERED- SENATOR WHICH- BUT GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR. AND THANKS FOR THE COMMENTS FROM- MY FELLOW. COMMITTEE MEMBERS ATTENDED A MAN AND SENATOR LARRY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WISDOM AND YOUR GUIDANCE AND THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD IT IN OUR COMMITTEE FOR EDUCATION AND WHICH MAKES ME VERY EXCITED THANK YOU FOR PRIORITIZING THE NEED TO PAY OFF ALL OF OUR DEFERRALS FOR SCHOOLS THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL I'M ALSO VERY PLEASED TO SEE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM AND CAREER TECH THAT WAS. DESPERATELY NEEDED. I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION HOWEVER AND IT HAS TO DO WITH- I'D LIKE TO KNOW. THE REASON BEHIND THE MORATORIUM. ON NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS IN CONTINUING AND WHAT IS THE REASON FOR THIS DECISION. IT SEEMS THAT FLEXIBLE TYPES OF LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS ARE CRITICAL NOT THE RETURNING TO THE IN PERSON LEARNING AS WE WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER WITH HAVING OPTIONS AND CHOICES FOR OUR FAMILIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR I'M GOING TO TURN TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES VERY DETAILED RESPONSE. ARE YOUR MUTED YOU NEED TO ON MUTE YOURSELF. WELL I APOLOGIZE I HAD A UNIT ON THE COMPUTER AND ON THE PHONE PARDON ME- ERR TODAVIA BARMAN A FINANCE- I WOULD JUST. NOTE THAT THE MORATORIUM ON THE- THE OPENING EXPANSION OF NON CONSERVATION CHARTER'S NOT ONLY- OPERATION OF EXISTING ACROSS THE STARTERS ARE WE JUST KNOW. THAT AND I THINK THE INTENT THE THINKING BEHIND THAT MORATORIUM CONTINUALLY- IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN. SEVERAL CASES A LOT OF SENSITIVITY AROUND- THE- THE STATE AMONG CONSERVATION CHARTERS- AND- WE FELT THAT IT MOST APPROPRIATE TO CONTINUE THAT MORATORIUM IN ORDER TO CONTINUE EXAMINING- WHAT IS HAPPENING WITHIN THE LANDSCAPE THERE. ARE SPECIALLY GIVEN THE PARADIGM. OF SCHOOL NOW CERTAINLY WITH. YEAH PERSON IS BEING THAT THE BUT AS YOU MAY- REALITY IS THAT COMPANIES MAY NOT BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT- THERE ISN'T- TOO MUCH. OF AN OPPORTUNITY- INTERNALLY OR OUT FOLKS TO- WHAT I SAY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A SITUATION THAT MAKES SENSE WHILE MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE STILL PRIORITIZING- YOU KNOW PARENTS CHOICE AND ULTIMATELY EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO THE MAXIMUM. EXTENT POSSIBLE. THE VERY- SO LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS BEFORE I GO TO THE PUBLIC- HEARING PORTION I WOULD JUST MAKE THE COMMENT THAT- I WANTED TO THANK SENATOR LAYERED FOR REINFORCING. THE VERY- HAITI DAY AND NOT ONLY DO JUST HISTORIC NATURE OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE FINDING IT THE HIGHEST A PROP NINETY EIGHT LEVEL BUT THAT THE OTHER ACTIONS. THAT WE TOOK IN OUR NOT ONLY IN THIS TRAILER BILL BUT IN OUR BUDGET ACTION SHEPHERDED BY. OUR SUB ONE SUB COMMITTEE. WE'RE VERY RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING ACTIONS LIKE PAYING OFF THE FULL DEFERRALS HANDS PUTTING FOUR BILLION IN THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RAINY DAY FUND SO I REALLY WANT TO GIVE KUDOS. TO THE- THE LEGISLATURE FOR. THE KID FOR ACTING IN THAT RESPONSIBLE WAY BUDGETING IN THAT RESPONSIBLE WAY. AN SO THAT WE NOT ONLY ARE CREATING A BASE BUDGET FOR OUR SCHOOLS THAT IS BEYOND SIGNIFICANT WE ARE ALSO ACTING RESPONSIBLY TO PROTECT OURSELVES GOING INTO THE FUTURE WHICH OF COURSE ALL OF US ARE VERY- VERY CONSCIOUS OF AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO AND THEN I WANTED TO ADD THAT THE IN MY OPENING COMMENTS I MENTIONED THAT WLL CHILD CARE IS NOT IN THIS PARTICULAR TRAILER BILL. WE DID IT WHILE WE'RE ACTING ON THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IN THIS TRAILER BILL. WE HAVE ACCOMMODATED FOR BOTH WE HAVE ACCOMMODATED THE LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET ACTION IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ACTION ACCOMMODATED FOR BOTH CHILD CARE AND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AS WE KNOW IT'S NECESSARY. AND NOT ONLY THAT WE ADDITIONALLY IN THIS TRAILER BILL. IS INCLUDED THE AFTER SCHOOL IN THE SUMMER PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OUR CHILDREN NEED. WE NEED BOTH EDUCATION AND CARE YEAR ROUND AND FULL DAY. SO WITH ALL OF THE ACTIONS WILL BE TAKING. CHILDCARE T. K. AFTER SCHOOL FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN AND THE REST WE'RE FINALLY AT A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE SOME HOPE THAT MOST OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN WOULD HAVE A SAFE. AND EDUCATIONALLY RICH. PLACE TO BE FOR AT THE TIME THAT THEY NEED YEAR ROUND AND THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND THEN FINALLY WE ARE CALIFORNIA ENACTS IN ACTING NOT ONLY THIS BUT THE BUDGET ACTION WE ALREADY TOOK WE WILL BE THE FIRST STATE TO RECOGNIZE THAT CHILDREN LEARN BETTER WHEN THEY'RE FED WHEN THEY'RE NOT HUNGRY AND THAT ANY CHILD COULD SHOW UP TO SCHOOL HUNGRY IT CAN THERE CAN BE ANY NUMBER OF REASONS WHY CHILD SHOWS UP TO SCHOOL HUNGRY. OF COURSE. OUR CHILDREN WITH FAMILIES THAT HAVE. OUR STRUGGLING ECONOMICALLY MAYBE OUR HIGHER LIKELY BUT ANY CHILD CAN SHOW UP TO SCHOOL HUNGRY AND THEN THEY'RE NOT GONNA LEARN AS WELL AND BY THIS BUDGET WE HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME SAID. SCHOOL MEALS ARE PART OF SCHOOL AND IF YOU NEED TO BE FED YOU'RE GOING TO BE FETED SCHOOL WHICH MEANS THAT YOU'LL LEARN BETTER AND THAT'S REALLY INCREDIBLE AND WE'RE THE FIRST STATE TO DO IT SO THERE'S MUCH IN HERE. FOR US TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY PROUD OF AND- I HOPE WHEN HE OPENED THE PUBLIC COMMENT THEY AGREE BUT LET'S SEE FIRST IF THERE'S ANYONE IN OUR MAIN HEARING ROOM WHO WANTS TO ADDRESS US. AND I DON'T SEE ANY SO THEN WE WILL SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE IN OUR AUXILIARY ROOM. LET'S SEE THE NOTE SEE ANY SO THEN WE WILL GO TO OUR PHONE LINES AND I WILL.

MY NAME IS SCOTT DAVIS AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE PARENT ASSOCIATION A GROUP OF THOUSANDS OF PARENTS TO MOBILIZE THAT SPRING TO SUCCESSFULLY SUED THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS I'M CALLING TO OPPOSE EIGHTY ONE THIRTY WHICH WILL CURRENTLY ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ONCE AGAIN CLOSE DOWN AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON AND ONLY REAL OPEN AGAIN WHEN THEY DEEM IT POSSIBLE. THE SINGLE BIGGEST FAILURE OF THIS LEGISLATURE PERHAPS IN THE HISTORY OF THE BODY WITH ITS FAILURE TO MANDATE AND ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS OF LAST YEAR'S AT THE NINETY EIGHT. THAT SCHOOLS QUOTE MUST OFFER IN PERSON TRACTION TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE UNQUOTE. THIS AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE ALLOWED SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO INVENT ANY NUMBER OF REASONS WHY IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO OPEN SCHOOL. RESULTED IN MOST SCHOOLS STAYING CLOSE ALL YEAR. IN CALIFORNIA RANKING FIFTIETH IN THE NATION FOR SCHOOL RE OPENING DURING THE PANDEMIC. WHILE EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY SAFELY- OPEN MORE SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. OUR STUDENTS IN THIS STATE SUFFERED IMMENSE LEARNING LOSS COUPLED WITH THE EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FROM BEING ISOLATED FROM THEIR TEACHERS AND PEERS WHILE ADULTS ON BACK TO WORK. DINED AT RESTAURANTS AND SOCIALIZE IN BARS. DESPITE NUMEROUS COMMENTS FROM LEGISLATORS THE DISTANCE LEARNING IS ENDING IN SCHOOLS WE BACK IN PERSON THIS SCHOOL YEAR SP ONE THIRTY CREATES PROVISION THAT ALLOWS SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO UNILATERALLY CLOSED SCHOOLS ANYTIME THEY SEE FIT FOR A PANDEMIC. WE TURN THAT HAS NO DEFINITION CASE THRESHOLD OR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER INVOLVED IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. THEN IT ONLY REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO REOPEN QUOTE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE UNQUOTE. THE SAME MEETING THIS REQUIREMENT ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS RED LEAGUE NORTH LAST YEAR WHEN THEY KEPT TELLING PARENTS IT WASN'T POSSIBLE TO REOPEN SCHOOLS. THE AUTHORITY TO CLOSE AN OPEN SCHOOL DURING AN EPIDEMIC SHOULD ONLY RESIDE WITH THE COUNTY OR CITY HEALTH OFFICER AND SHOULD BE BASED ON CLEAR THRESHOLDS OF CASES THAT IMPACT THE ABILITY OF CHILDREN TO BE LEARNING IN CLASSROOMS. IF THIS IS NOT MADE CLEAR IN EIGHTY ONE THIRTY. CALIFORNIA WILL BE DOOMED TO ANOTHER YEAR OF MASS SCHOOL CLOSURES WHICH WILL FURTHER HARM OUR CHILDREN AND THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA.
