A RISE IN FRONT OF THIS AUGUST BODY TO RECOGNIZE BLACK HISTORY MONTH. BUT IN ESSENCE I'M HERE TODAY TO RECOGNIZE. BURKE INTREST. BECAUSE IF TOLD CORRECTLY BLACK HISTORY IS AMERICAN HISTORY IT IS WORLD HISTORY IS YOUR HISTORY. THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES IS RICH WITH INSPIRATIONAL STORIES OF GREAT MEN AND NOBLE WOMEN WHOSE ACTIONS WORDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE SUCCESS AND PROSPERITY. THIS COUNTRY ENJOYS TODAY. FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS OF THE UNITED STATES THE COURSE OF ITS HISTORY HAS BEEN GREATLY INFLUENCED BY AFRICAN AMERICAN HEROES EMPIRE NEARS IT FIGHTING FOR OUR FREEDOMS IN SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT. WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCIENCE MADISON BUSINESS EDUCATION INDUSTRY AND SOCIAL LEADERSHIP. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO'S EVER HAD OPEN HEART SURGERY YOU NEED TO KNOW THE NAME OF DANIEL HALE WILLIAMS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO PERFORM OR THE FIRST AMERICAN I SHOULD SAY TO PERFORM OPEN HEART SURGERY IN EIGHTEEN. NINETY THREE. YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO'S EVER NEEDED A BLOOD TRANSFUSION YOU SHOULD KNOW THE NAME OF CHARLES ARCHER. AND AFTER AMERICAN DOCTOR WHO INVENTED THE BLOOD BANK AND SEPARATING BLOOD AND PLASMA STORAGE THIS INDIVIDUALS SEARCH SAVE THOUSANDS OF LIVES. DURING WORLD WAR. TWO DR KING. DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR OFTEN STATED OVER THE LAST OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO. FROM THE TIME WE GET UP IN THE MORNING. AND GO TO WORK OR GO TO SCHOOL. OUR LIVES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY INVENTION AND INNOVATION. OF AFRICAN AMERICANS MORE THAN ANY OTHER RACE ON THIS PLANET. I HAVE CENTURY AFTER THE ABOLISHMENT OF SLAVERY. DR CARTER G. WOODSON. KNOWN AS THE FATHER OF BLACK HISTORY FOUNDED NEGRO HISTORY WEEK IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX THE COINCIDE WITH THE BIRTHDAY OF TWO OF HIS HEROES FREDERICK DOUGLASS. AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN. AS IS DISTINGUISHED AFRICAN AMERICAN AUTHOR. EDITOR PUBLISHER AND HISTORIAN DR CARTER G. WOODSON INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE FURTHER RESEARCH AND PUBLISHING REGARDING THE UNTOLD STORIES OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HERITAGE A PRIME EXAMPLE IS THE BOOK THAT EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU WILL RECEIVE LATER THIS WEEK THE MISEDUCATION OF THE NEGRO. I HOPE YOU ALL NOT ONLY JUST OPEN IT. BUT READ IT AND REALIZE THE MIS EDUCATION THE DR CARTER G. WOODSON SPOKE ABOUT MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO STILL EXISTS TODAY. DR WATSON UNDERSTOOD THE VALUE OF CAPTURING THE TRUE NARRATIVE. ALL OF OUR PEOPLE NOT JUST THE WHITE WASHED THE CODE SANITISE LICE THEY HAVE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS THEY CONTINUE TO MAKE. THE WHITE MAN THE HERO. AMERICA LOVES A GOOD LIFE AND A GOOD LIAR AS WE'VE SEEN FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED BLACK HISTORY CALLING PAUL CALLING UPON THE PUBLIC TO SEIZE OPPORTUNITY THE HONOR. THE TWO ALL TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF BLACK AMERICANS IN EVERY AREA. OF ENDEAVOR THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY. AFTER AMERICANS OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE.

THERE ARE WHITE BROTHERS AND SISTERS FACE JUST ONE SCINTILLA OF THE HATRED AND VIOLENCE THE PRESIDENT'S DISCRIMINATION THAT WE HAVEN'T TOURED SINCE ARE FORCED TO RIVAL. THEY WOULD HAVE BOARDED THE NINA THE PINTA THE SANTA MARIA AND THE MANY FLOWERS SO FAST THAT ARE HERE TOO IT'S BEEN. THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BACK TO THEIR HOMES OF ORIGIN ON THE FIRST THING SMOKING. YET AFTER AN AMERICANS OF STATE AND CONTINUE TO SERVE AND CONTRIBUTE TO AMERICAN SOCIETY AT ALL LEVELS WE HAVE FOUGHT IN EVERY WAR. SINCE THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR ONLY TO RETURN TO BE RECOGNIZED AS ANYTHING BUT A HERO WE'VE BEEN CALLED EVERYTHING BUT THE SON OF GOD. WE'VE BEEN DENIED HOUSING WE'VE BEEN DENIED EDUCATION WE'VE BEEN DENIED OUR LIBERTY. WE ARE THE TRUE PATRIOTS. OF IMMIGRANT PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OTHER THAN OUR NATIVE-AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE ALL HERE AS AN IMMIGRANT IMMIGRANTS. WE ARE NOT THE ANGRY WHITE MOB THAT STORMED THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY SIX WE HAVE NEVER TRIED TO OVERTURN A THOROUGH AMERICAN GOVERNMENT OR DEMOCRACY ONLY TO MAKE IT BETTER. ONLY TO MAKE IT LIVE UP TO ITS WORDS THAT ALL MEN AND WOMEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. THIS BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS THE NO I REMEMBER AFTER AMERICANS WHO HAVE MADE AND ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE THAT IMPACTS ALL COMMUNITIES. IT IS DURING THIS MONTH. WE COMMEMORATE AND HONOR MEN AND WOMEN. SUCH AS PROJECT ROBERTS ALPHANUMERIC EMPIRE NEAR THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN ELECTED TO THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN. DONALD MERVIN M.

THE STRUGGLES FOR EQUALITY INCLUDE THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT AGAINST THE BRUTAL AND UNJUST KILLINGS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. GENERATIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS THROUGH WORDS AND ACTIONS HAVE MADE IMMEASURABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SUCCESS AND PROSPERITY OF OUR STATE AND NATION. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE GREAT WORK PRODUCED BY SO MANY NOTABLE AFRICAN AMERICANS HAS ALSO BENEFITED AND INFLUENCED THE LATINO COMMUNITY. THURGOOD MARSHALL'S LEGAL WORK REPRESENTED THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF ALL PEOPLE.

THESE ARE JUST TWO OF GREAT AFRICAN AMERICANS WHOSE LIFE WORKS HAD HAD HAS HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE LATINO COMMUNITY IN TWO THOUSAND THREE. IN HONOR AND FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS THE IMMIGRANT WORKERS FREEDOM RIDERS LAUNCHED ACROSS THIS COUNTRY LED BY JOHN CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS AND REVEREND JAMES LAWSON THEY CONTINUE TO REMIND US.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO THANK ALL MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE RISEN TO DATE TO ADD THEIR VOICE TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE OF RECOGNIZING AMERICAN HISTORY. DEFINE TODAY AS BLACK HISTORY AND I WANT TO QUICKLY RUN THROUGH SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT I WANT TO ASK YOU TO REMEMBER ONCE YOU LEAVE TODAY. BUT AS THE OLD FOLKS SAY WE COULD BE HERE TO THE COWS CAME HOME. THAT WE LISTED ALL THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE MADE TO THIS COUNTRY. WE STAND IN THIS OF BLIGHTED CHAMBER TODAY BECAUSE OF THE INVENTION OF THE LIGHT BULB SO LET'S THINK LEWIS LATIMER. WE TRAVEL NOW ON ELECTRIC TRAINS AND BUSES BECAUSE OF THE VETERAN OF ELECTRIC TROLLEY BY ALBERT ROBERTSON. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT OUR FOOD IN REFRIGERATORS BECAUSE OF MR STARK. AND WE CAN BOARD ELEVATOR AND A SEND UP A SKYSCRAPER IN A MATTER OF SECONDS BECAUSE OF ALEXANDER MILES. AND WE CAN HEAR HOME WHAT A FURNACE BECAUSE OF ALISON PARKER. AND AS WE TRAVERSE THE STREETS AND WE REACH INTERSECTIONS AND SAFETY KNOWING THAT THE LIGHT TO REGULATE TRAFFIC LET'S REMEMBER DERRICK MORGAN. WHEN YOU REACH FOR YOUR CELLPHONE TODAY. DON'T BELIEVE THE LIE THAT A GUY NAMED MARTY COOPER INVENTED TO CELL PHONE IT WAS A BLACK MAN BY THE NAME OF HENRY SAMPSON IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE NGUYEN VAN IT'S A CELL PHONE. MISTER COOPER ONLY MADE THE FIRST CALL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE. CONTINUE PRESS YOUR CLOTHES TODAY. IF THOSE OF WHO ARE. REMEMBER CEREMONY WHEN BENNETT. DARN BOARD. IT FOR ALL OF US WHO GREW UP WANTING TO BE COWBOYS PLEASE NOTE THAT THAT WAS A DEROGATORY TERM FOR BLACK PANTS THE TERM CALL BOY DID NOT COME INTO REAL ACCEPTANCE UNTIL THE LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS AND EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES WE START MAKING WESTERNS STARRING TOM MIX AND WILLIAM S. HART. BUT BLACKS WERE REFERRED AS COWBOYS BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE A FRIEND OR KNOW SOMEBODY WHO STILL CALL GROWN **** MEN BOYS SO THAT WAS A DEROGATORY TERM FOR COWBOYS AND IF IT WASN'T FOR THE LIVES AGAIN BUT INDIVIDUALS LIKE JOHN WAYNE WE WOULD SEE MORE BLACK COWBOYS BECAUSE BIG LEAD TO CATTLE DRIVES. HAVE YOU EVER WATCHED A WESTERN UNION CITY CROSSING A RIVER. THEY WANT TO BRING A CALVET CROSS. THE TRUTH THE BEEN TELL YOU HAVE SEEN IT AN AMERICAN. BECAUSE THEY WERE THE FOR ONE TO HIT THE CROSS THE RIVER TO MAKE SURE WOULD SAY. THEY WANT SYNDICATE. ACROSS THE ROOM AND THAT BLACK PERSON CROSSES FIRST. AND THEN IT MADE OKAY FOR THE PALATABLE CROSS BAILEY TO CHAU. AND FOR ALL OF US WHO MIGHT HAVE UP WITH THE LONG RANGER. THIS SPARKLY WHITE GUY IT'S GREAT MATCH PATENTS SURE WHAT IS WHITE STETSON WHAT IS COMPARED. THE NEED AMERICAN. WHAT IS MASS GONE. I HOPE IN THE LORD YOU KNOW. THERE WAS A REAL LONG RANGER BUT HIS NAME WAS BASS REEVES IT WAS A RUN AWAY SLAVE DURING THE CIVIL. WAR WHO ESCAPED TO WHAT IS NOW OR WHAT WAS THEN CALLED INDIAN TERRITORY. MISTER REEVES WITH A MASTER OF DISGUISE SO I GUESS THAT'S WHY THE DAYS LONG RANGER WAR MASS. HE WAS EXCELLENT MARKSMEN. HE WAS A SKILLED HORSEMEN AND YES HE HAD A COMPANION THAT WAS NATIVE AMERICAN AND HE WAS DEPUTIZED AS A DEPUTY U. S. MARSHAL- DURING A DURING THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES ANY PROTECTED TERRITORY THROUGHOUT. THE WEST AND YES HE WROTE A SILVER HORSE. OKAY SO EVEN WHEN YOU REPRESENT US IN MOVIES AND TELEVISION YOU APPROPRIATE ARE TRUE CULTURE AND OUR TRUE STORY ANOTHER EXAMPLE HIDDEN FIGURES THE AMAZING STORY OF THESE THREE AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN. DOROTHY VON CATHERINE JOHNSON A MERRY WATER IN THAT MOVIE THERE'S A SCENE A KEVIN COSTNER PLAYED WHERE HE FED UP WITH THE STORMS INTO THE FACILITY ANY SNATCHES DOWN THE WHITE ONLY RESTROOM SIGN. THAT NEVER HAPPENED. MRS JOHNSON STATED I CONTINUE TO USE THAT BATHROOM DESPITE ALL THEIR COMPLAINTS THAT THE SIGN WAS NEVER PULL IT DOWN ONLY SURE THAT BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU TELL OUR STORY YOU STILL HAVE TO MAKE. A WHITE PERSON THE HERO THEY STILL HAVE TO BE THE PROTAGONIST WE CAN NEVER. HELLO TRUE STORY TOLD EVEN IN THE-MOVIE GREENBUSH. WHEN YOU HAVE DOCTOR CHENEY AMAZING. PATTERSON TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH THIS WHITE DRIVER IT WAS AN EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP THEY WORK BUDDIES YES THEY GOT ALONG FINE BUT IT MADE A NEW MOVIE AS THIS DRIVER WAS HIS HERO HIS GREAT PROTECTOR IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. SO I ASSISTED KNOW THE TROOPS STORE AND THE NO ONE OF THE AMAZING COLPOYS IN THIS COUNTRY WAS A BLACK MAN BY THE NAME OF BILL PICKETT. BILL PICKETT CONSIDERED THE BEST CAL BOY TO HAVE EVER LIVED. HE PARTICIPATED IN RODEO ALL AROUND THE WORLD BUT MANY TIMES WHEN HE PARTICIPATED IN THESE UNITED STATES HE HAD TO SAY HE WAS A NATIVE AMERICAN IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE. AND I GREW UP WITH THE NAME OF BILL PICKETT IN MY HOME. AND I COULDN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND BILL PICKETT BECAUSE I'D NEVER SAW A BLACK CAL BOYS GROWING UP. MY FATHER.

HE CONSIDERED HIM YOU KNOW WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU'RE BLACK AND YOU TO SMARTER UPDATE YOUR THIS YEAR THAT AND HE THOUGHT IF YOU TOO SMART TOO WERE CONNIVING TO DO SOMETHING. WELL IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE. A SMALL POX. PANDEMIC BROKE OUT.
