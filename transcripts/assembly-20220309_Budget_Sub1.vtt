FOSTER CARE. ACT OF PROPORTION

00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:50.348
THE LARGER. POPULATION OFF THIS

00:35:50.414 --> 00:35:52.316
COMPARE POP. IS THE- CHILD

00:35:52.383 --> 00:35:54.986
POPULATION SO FOR EXAMPLE IN

TWENTY TWENTY BLACK CHILDREN

00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:57.421
ACCOUNTED 421% OF ALL CHILDREN

RATIOS THERE A SUMMARY MEASURE

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:43.534
BY WHICH WE CAN HELP SHOW THE

00:36:43.601 --> 00:36:45.236
DEGREE OF THIS INEQUALITY AT

00:36:45.303 --> 00:36:46.537
DIFFERENT DECISION POINTS ALONG

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:47.905
THE CHAO WALKER COULD CHANGE.

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:49.774
BASICALLY WE COMPARE THE RATE AT

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.343
A GIVEN DECISION POINT OF ONE

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.945
GROUP WITH ANOTHER SO FOR

00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:55.246
EXAMPLE. IN TWENTY TWENTY BLACK

CHILDREN ENTERED FOSTER CARE AT

00:36:56.781 --> 00:36:58.382
A RATE OF ABOUT EIGHT POINT

00:36:58.449 --> 00:37:00.251
SEVEN PER THOUSAND. WHILE WHITE

00:37:00.318 --> 00:37:01.686
CHILDREN ENTERED FOSTER CARE

00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:03.287
RATE ABOUT TWO POINT ONE PER

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:04.755
THOUSAND SO THE BLACK WHITE

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:06.958
DISPARITY RATIO FOR ENTRIES.

00:37:07.024 --> 00:37:08.225
WOULD BE THE EIGHT POINT SEVEN

00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:09.827
DIVIDED BY THE TWO POINT ONE

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:11.529
GIVING US A COLLECTION OF ABOUT

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:13.064
ADJUSTABLE CORD THAT IS TO SAY.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.532

WE'VE HEARD REPEATEDLY AND

00:41:53.577 --> 00:41:55.346
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT ADEQUATE

00:41:55.412 --> 00:41:56.580
LEGAL REPRESENTATION IS

00:41:56.647 --> 00:41:58.215
ESSENTIAL TO WRITING THIS POWER

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.488
THESE DISPARITIES BEGIN WELL

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:05.923
BEFORE THE FAMILY APPEARS IN

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:09.758
CREATE IT WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:10.859
CULTURE. REMAINS STRONG AND

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:12.594
THOSE THAT- THROUGH A

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:13.895
GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM THE TRIED TO

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:15.530
SIMULATE- AND TAKE AWAY THAT

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:17.599
CULTURE THAT NOW. WHEN IN THE

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:19.001
FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THAT THEY'RE

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:20.869
NOW BEING LOOKED TO BE ENGAGE

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:22.571
WITH A NATIVE AMERICAN FAMILY.

01:17:22.637 --> 01:17:25.507
AND WITHOUT- MOVING FORWARD ON

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:27.709
THOSE THOSE ISSUES AND- IN THOSE

01:17:27.776 --> 01:17:29.511
TOPICS AND WE KNOW THAT IT QUA

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:31.613
AND CAL EQUIPMENT AND SOMETIMES

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.883
COUNTIES- HAVE TO BE. REMINDED

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:36.952
TO BE ENGAGED IN THAT PROCESS

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:39.388
OF. HAVING NATIVE AMERICAN

01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:41.323
CHILDREN TO NATIVE AMERICAN

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:43.625

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:45.494
CHRYSOSTOM BUT- HOW DO YOU SEE-

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.962
AND THIS IS A QUESTION WE'RE

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:48.230
POSING MISTER. CHAIRMAN YOU

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:51.099
COULD FIGURE OUT- AND IMPOSE THE

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:51.700
QUESTIONS OF THOSE THAT COULD

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:54.169
BEST ANSWER. AND IT'S A GENERAL

01:17:54.236 --> 01:17:56.338
QUESTION IS IN CALIFORNIA. AND

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:57.839
HOW ARE WE BEST TO PROTECT THE

01:17:57.906 --> 01:17:59.574
CITIZENS IN THE CHILD WELFARE

01:17:59.641 --> 01:18:03.345

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:07.582
TOWARDS THE NATIVE AMERICAN-

01:18:07.649 --> 01:18:08.550
CHILDREN HERE IN THE STATE. ON

AT ALL DIFFERENT THAT CAN

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:11.953
CERTAIN TALK ABOUT THE STATE BUT

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:12.754
HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE THE COUNTY

01:18:12.821 --> 01:18:14.156
TO THE ENGAGE WITH THAT

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:15.891
ESPECIALLY. AS WE SEE WHAT'S

01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:17.092
GOING ON AROUND THE TOPIC OF

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:19.961
ECWA NOW. LET'S BEGIN WITH THE

DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:24.366
POSSIBLE. SURE I WOULD SAY I

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:26.068
THINK YOU SOMEWHERE I THINK THAT

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:28.370
AT THE FIELD SPECIALISTS AT

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:30.472
POSITION THAT I REFERENCE IS ONE

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:31.473
OF THOSE WAYS WHERE WE ARE IT'S

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.241
THE IT'S THE CONNECTOR THE

01:18:33.308 --> 01:18:34.176
BRIDGE BETWEEN THE COUNTY AND

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:36.211

QUARTERLY BASIS WITH TRIBES OF

WHICH THIS IS ONE OF THAT

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:49.791
PRIMARY TOPICS OF THE STANDING

01:18:49.858 --> 01:18:50.592
AGENDA ITEM THAT WE DISCUSSED

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:52.494

CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS ARE

01:19:08.777 --> 01:19:10.312
BEING EXPERIENCED IN

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:11.379
RELATIONSHIP TO IMPLEMENTATION

01:19:11.446 --> 01:19:13.548

IN THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:27.395
CAPACITY. TO ENSURE

01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:28.296
IMPLEMENTATION IS OCCURRING.

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:29.598
MISTER CHAIR A IN THROUGH THE

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:32.000
CHAIR OF ITS A- WE COULD SEE

01:19:32.067 --> 01:19:33.735
SOME TYPE COMPARING DATA- MAYBE

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:35.537
THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS PRIOR. TO

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:37.072
WHERE WE'RE AT NOW TO SEE IF

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:38.273
SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS IN THE

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.541
WAY THE APPROACH THAT'S TAKING

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.643
PLACE IS A TRULY HAVING. AN

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:42.944
IMPACT- WITHIN THE NATIVE

01:19:43.011 --> 01:19:45.147
AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND IF SO

01:19:45.213 --> 01:19:46.448
GREAT WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.016
DIRECTION IF NOT THEN MAYBE

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:49.784
THAT'S WHEN WE NEED TO- COME

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:51.486
BACK TOGETHER AND HAVE SOME MORE

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:53.088
DISCUSSIONS AND I BELIEVE IN

01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:55.223
COLLUDING. AGAIN THE NATIVE

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:56.424
AMERICAN COMMUNITY INTO SOME OF

01:19:56.491 --> 01:19:59.127
THESE AREAS- WOULD BE BENEFICIAL

01:19:59.194 --> 01:20:01.163
WE SEE THE NUMBERS THAT ARE HERE

01:20:01.229 --> 01:20:02.631
WE SEE THEIR HIGH WE SEE THEIR

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:05.000
ALARMING. BUT THROUGH THE CHAIR

01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:06.835
THE NUMBERS THREE YEARS AGO FIVE

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:10.138
YEARS AGO WITH A SIMILAR ARE TO

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:12.507
HAVE WE MADE AN IMPACT. I MISS

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:15.610
YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN I CAN SPEAK

01:20:15.677 --> 01:20:18.180
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- BECAUSE OF

01:20:18.246 --> 01:20:19.247
THE POINT IT'S A IT'S A VERY

01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:21.216
GOOD POINT BECAUSE SPECTACULAR

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:23.685
PLACE UP BUT HOW WE NEED TO BE

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:25.086
MINDFUL OF THESE DISPARITY

01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:26.421
INDUSTRIES THAT MAKE THE

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:27.789
COMPARISONS BETWEEN THESE GROUPS

01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:30.058
AND THEY- IN SOME CASES SIMPLIFY

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:32.260
SOME OF THE UNDERLYING. TRENDS

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:34.196
THAT ARE GOING ON SO WITHOUT

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:36.097
TAKING ANY FOCUS AWAY FROM THE

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.465
NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS AREA

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:40.068
ABSOLUTELY WE NEED TO I WILL SAY

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:41.469
THAT THAT THE DRAPES IF WE IF

01:20:41.536 --> 01:20:43.805
YOU LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING RATES

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:45.307
OF ENTRIES FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE

01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:47.475
BEEN DECLINING IN OUR STATE. FOR

01:20:47.542 --> 01:20:49.544
AMERICAN INDIAN CHILDREN AS WELL

01:20:49.611 --> 01:20:51.313
AS FOR ALL THE CHILDREN AND SO

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:53.315
THE DECLINE OVER THAT TIME IS

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:55.383
GOING DOWN FOR ALL OF OUR ALL OF

01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:57.385
THE DIFFERENT GROUPS SO THAT THE

01:20:57.452 --> 01:20:58.954
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM- ARE

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.488
START WORK WILL RETAIN THEM EVEN

01:21:00.555 --> 01:21:02.090
THOUGH WE MAY WE ARE MAKING SOME

01:21:02.157 --> 01:21:04.526
PROGRESS IN TERMS OF OUR

01:21:04.593 --> 01:21:06.094
INTEREST. RATES FOR THAT

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:08.430
PARTICULAR GROUP SO I COULD SAY

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:10.098
PARK- FIVE YEARS AGO THE RATE OF

01:21:10.165 --> 01:21:12.467
REMOVAL OR AMERICAN INDIAN

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:18.106
CHILDREN WAS- ABOUT- ELEVEN PER

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:19.507
THOUSAND SENATE AND THEN NOW IT

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:22.043
STATES THAT EIGHT POINT SO I

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:23.378
THINK IT'S OVER EIGHT SO IT'S

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:25.747
STILL. VERY HIGH COMPARED TO THE

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:27.349
OVERALL RATE FOR OUR STATE BUT

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:28.750
IT HAS BEEN BEEN COMING DOWN SO

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:30.318
AND WHEN YOU COMPARE THE

01:21:30.385 --> 01:21:32.921
AMERICAN INDIAN RIGHT. TO THE

01:21:32.988 --> 01:21:35.490
TOP FLIGHT- INTEREST ENTRY RIGHT

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:37.492
NOW THEY'RE STILL THAT THAT

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.527
DISPARITY STILL THIS PERCEPTION

01:21:39.594 --> 01:21:41.263
WE DEFINITELY NEED TO WORK ON IT

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:42.430
BUT I BUT SPEECH YOUR POINT

01:21:42.497 --> 01:21:44.366
ABOUT ARE WE MAKING PROGRESS IT

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:45.600
DOES APPEAR FROM THE DATA. IS

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:47.569
THAT WE ARE MOVING IN A GOOD

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:49.304
DIRECTION I WILL SAY TO ECHO

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:50.705
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES POINTS WE

01:21:50.772 --> 01:21:52.974
NEED BETTER DATA TO EXAMINE

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:55.610
THOSE AREAS THOSE INTERVENTIONS

01:21:55.677 --> 01:21:57.245
THE MORE GRANULAR LEVEL TO SEE

01:21:57.312 --> 01:21:58.780
WHERE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THE

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:00.115
BARRIERS ARE THAT WE CAN

01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:01.416
OVERCOME AND FIND OUT WHICH

01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:03.251
PROGRAMS MAY BE HAVING. A BETTER

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:05.553
A FACT THAT WE CAN ONLY DO THAT

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.489
BY FOCUSING IN ON SPECIFIC

01:22:07.555 --> 01:22:08.857

01:38:52.626 --> 01:38:53.694
HELPING CALIFORNIA'S X. ART

01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:55.362
CREATE THE FIRST STATEWIDE

01:38:55.429 --> 01:38:56.897
INVESTMENT. IN HOME VISITING WE

01:38:56.964 --> 01:38:58.565
ARE VERY PROUD OF THAT-

01:38:58.632 --> 01:39:00.200
INITIATIVE AND I THINK THE

01:39:00.267 --> 01:39:01.235
DEPARTMENT HAS DONE A WONDERFUL

01:39:01.302 --> 01:39:03.003
JOB- INITIATING THE

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:04.605
IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PROGRAM.

01:39:04.672 --> 01:39:06.373
WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES WITH

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:07.574
EIGHT IN ADDITION TO MY COMMENTS

01:39:07.641 --> 01:39:09.610
ABOUT THE PANDEMIC SLOWING DOWN

01:39:09.677 --> 01:39:11.512
THE- EXPANSION AND

01:39:11.578 --> 01:39:13.380
IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT EFFORT.

01:39:13.447 --> 01:39:16.116
IS THAT- HOME VISITING IN ORDER

01:39:16.183 --> 01:39:18.218
TO BE EFFECTIVE REQUIRES THAT

01:39:18.285 --> 01:39:21.021
THOSE IN THE FIELD ARE CONNECTED

01:39:21.088 --> 01:39:22.323
TO ALL OF THE SERVICES AND

01:39:22.389 --> 01:39:23.490
SUPPORT AND I UNDERSTAND WHERE

01:39:23.557 --> 01:39:25.025
THEY CAN REFER FAMILIES CHOOSE

01:39:25.092 --> 01:39:26.527
THAT THEY NEED TO BE EMBEDDED IN

01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:28.429
WELL THAT WORKED. AND THERE HAS

01:39:28.495 --> 01:39:30.397
TO BE LOCAL THE STUDENTS FOR

01:39:30.464 --> 01:39:31.498
THOSE I'M HOPING THAT ARE HAVE%

01:39:31.565 --> 01:39:33.167
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR COUNTY

01:39:33.233 --> 01:39:34.935
AGENCY PARTNERS WITH OTHER CEOS

01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:38.939
THINKING ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:41.041
EXPAND LOCAL ON AN

01:39:41.108 --> 01:39:42.876
INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT THERE ARE

01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:44.111
ALREADY CONVERSATIONS THE

01:39:44.178 --> 01:39:45.412
EFFORTS HAPPENING ACROSS THE

01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:47.614
STATE L.A. COUNTY HOUSE- A

01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:49.483
STELLAR MODEL IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:50.117

01:39:55.456 --> 01:39:57.157
THEY- SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN

01:39:57.224 --> 01:39:58.359
TERMS OF IDENTIFYING RESOURCES

01:39:58.425 --> 01:39:59.660

01:39:59.727 --> 01:40:01.695
TO MAKE SURE COUNTIES HOW. THOSE

01:40:01.762 --> 01:40:03.130
KINDS OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:40:03.197 --> 01:40:05.733
RELATIONSHIPS EXPANDED- ACROSS

01:40:05.799 --> 01:40:07.201
THE STATE SO THEY CAN MAXIMIZE

01:40:07.267 --> 01:40:09.303
SMALL AMOUNT OF RESEARCH THAT WE

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:10.604
CURRENTLY HAVE FOR HOME VISITING

01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:12.940
AND OBVIOUSLY OF COURSE I THINK

01:40:13.006 --> 01:40:13.540
EXPANDING. OUR INVESTMENT IN

01:40:13.607 --> 01:40:16.510
HOME VISITING WOULD BE A GREAT.

01:40:16.577 --> 01:40:19.113
STAFF THAT ALSO REQUIRES THAT WE

01:40:19.179 --> 01:40:20.681
WORK CLOSELY WITH THE NATIONAL

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:22.883

INVESTMENT BY A FEW PERCENTAGE.

01:40:27.721 --> 01:40:29.890
IT KIND OF OVERTAKES THE COUNTRY

01:40:29.957 --> 01:40:31.392
BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE

01:40:31.458 --> 01:40:33.494
COMPARED TO OTHER PLACES SO IF

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.662

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:15.903

PROGRAM IN PROJECT ORIGINALLY

01:41:23.477 --> 01:41:25.345
STARTED OUT OF THE IDEA THAT

01:41:25.412 --> 01:41:27.214
THERE WERE CONFLICTING. ASK

01:41:27.281 --> 01:41:29.283

MIGHT RESULT IN NON COMPLIANCE

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:45.065
OF THE OTHER NOT SIMPLY I WASN'T

01:41:45.132 --> 01:41:47.568

02:14:53.718 --> 02:14:55.987
A BACK IN THE- OFFICE IT WAS

02:14:56.054 --> 02:14:58.990
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY

02:14:59.057 --> 02:15:00.559
TEN YOU KNOW THAT IN TWENTY

02:15:00.625 --> 02:15:02.561
ELEVEN WE REALIGN THE REMAINDER

02:15:02.627 --> 02:15:03.829
OF CHILD WELFARE UNDER THE

02:15:03.895 --> 02:15:05.831
TWENTY WHAT THAT. REALIGNMENT AT

02:15:05.897 --> 02:15:08.300
THAT TIME- IT WAS NOT A

02:15:08.366 --> 02:15:09.234
CANDIDATE FOR EVERY COUNTY TO DO

02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:11.703
RFA FIFTY THREE ARE LEGISLATION

02:15:11.770 --> 02:15:14.573
AND- TWENTY FIFTEEN I'M MADE OF

02:15:14.639 --> 02:15:16.141
THE STATEWIDE REQUIREMENTS AND

02:15:16.208 --> 02:15:19.578
WE- I KNOW WHAT WE KNOW EXACTLY

02:15:19.644 --> 02:15:21.847
HOW MUCH IS BEING SPENT. WARRANT

02:15:21.913 --> 02:15:23.915
AREN'T PAID BY COUNTIES BECAUSE

02:15:23.982 --> 02:15:26.651
WE HAVE A TRUE UP. STATUTORILY

02:15:26.718 --> 02:15:29.054
REQUIRED PROCESS THAT IS RELATED

02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:31.423
TO OPPOSITION THIRTY THAT

02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:33.992
REQUIRES FUNDING OF A NEW

02:15:34.059 --> 02:15:35.861
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE ENACTED

02:15:35.927 --> 02:15:37.629
AFTER TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT.

02:15:37.696 --> 02:15:40.198
AND SO IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED

02:15:40.265 --> 02:15:41.800
MILLION A YEAR- WE APPRECIATE

02:15:41.867 --> 02:15:43.368
THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION

02:15:43.435 --> 02:15:45.003
APPROVING EIGHTY FIVE MILLION

02:15:45.070 --> 02:15:46.705
DOLLARS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR ON

02:15:46.771 --> 02:15:48.707
A ONE TIME BASIS FOR THAT. OF A

02:15:48.773 --> 02:15:51.042
COUNTIES ARE USING THESE FUNDS-

02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:58.350
TO OFFSET THE OTHERWISE UNFUNDED. ARCTIC IT IS A SIGNIFICANT

02:15:58.416 --> 02:16:00.552
THOUGH AN ALL INVEST. AND WE

02:16:00.619 --> 02:16:01.953
KNOW THAT THAT WE NEED TO

02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:04.789
CONTINUE THIS FUNDING BECAUSE IT

02:16:04.856 --> 02:16:07.259
CARRIES A SHIFT THEIR RESOURCES

02:16:07.325 --> 02:16:08.460
AWAY FROM OTHER TYPES OF

02:16:08.527 --> 02:16:10.795
SERVICES IN ORDER TO COVER THAT.

02:16:10.862 --> 02:16:14.266
UP AND IT NEEDS TO BE AN ONGOING

02:16:14.332 --> 02:16:15.534
FUND. AND THEN FINALLY THE THIRD

02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:17.502
QUESTION IS RELATED TO ENSURING

02:16:17.569 --> 02:16:18.603
THAT THEIR SUFFICIENT EMERGENCY

02:16:18.670 --> 02:16:20.505
PLACEMENTS FOR YOU. TO COME INTO

02:16:20.572 --> 02:16:22.240
THE SYSTEM AND EXPECTEDLY

02:16:22.307 --> 02:16:25.043
ESPECIALLY THOSE ON A RELATIVE

02:16:25.110 --> 02:16:26.278
WHO ARE WILLING OR ABLE TO CARE

02:16:26.344 --> 02:16:28.280
FOR THEM. AND AT TIMES WE HAVE

02:16:28.346 --> 02:16:30.482
NOTICED THAT WERE ABOUT TO I

02:16:30.549 --> 02:16:32.183
NEED TO BRING A CHILD INTO

02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:33.618
CUSTODY FOR THEIR SAFETY. IT CAN

02:16:33.685 --> 02:16:35.554
HAPPEN UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:36.555
NIGHT IT CAN HAPPEN ON THE

02:16:36.621 --> 02:16:38.089
WEEKEND WE MAY NOT IMMEDIATELY

02:16:38.156 --> 02:16:39.558
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT

02:16:39.624 --> 02:16:42.360
FAMILY AND WHO. WOULD BE A GOOD.

02:16:42.427 --> 02:16:43.562
PLACE MATT WAS PART OF THE

02:16:43.628 --> 02:16:45.397
FAMILY ARE NOT RELATED EXTENDED

02:16:45.463 --> 02:16:47.265
FAMILY MEMBER. SO IT'S REALLY

02:16:47.332 --> 02:16:48.567
CRITICAL THAT WE WORK WITH THE

02:16:48.633 --> 02:16:49.501
STATE WILL WORK WITH THE

02:16:49.568 --> 02:16:51.503
LEGISLATURE AS NEEDED TO DEVELOP

02:16:51.570 --> 02:16:53.204
AND FUNDING OPTIONS FOR COUNTIES

02:16:53.271 --> 02:16:55.206
TO SAFELY. TEMPORARILY PLACE

02:16:55.273 --> 02:16:56.474
CHILDREN IN UGANDA DIVERSITY

02:16:56.541 --> 02:16:58.476
BATES SAID IF A RELATIVE OR

02:16:58.543 --> 02:17:01.713
OTHER POTENTIAL. CARE GIVER IS

02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:03.014
NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE. WHEN

02:17:03.081 --> 02:17:04.316
I FOR STARTED IT W. D. MORE THAT

02:17:04.382 --> 02:17:06.084
YEARS MANY COUNTIES OPERATED

02:17:06.151 --> 02:17:07.319
SHELTERS. WHERE CHILDREN COULD

02:17:07.385 --> 02:17:09.154
BE TAKEN FOR SHORT TERM STAYS.

02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:10.322
AND TYPICALLY WE WERE TALKING

02:17:10.388 --> 02:17:11.923
ABOUT THOSE CHILDREN WHO HAD

02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:13.758
JUST ENTERED THE SYSTEM. LACK OF

02:17:13.825 --> 02:17:15.660
TALKING ABOUT- OVER TIME THE

02:17:15.727 --> 02:17:17.495
MOST COUNTIES HAVE CLOSE THE

02:17:17.562 --> 02:17:18.463
TEMPORARY SHELTERS. THERE WERE

02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:20.098
CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT THE LENGTH

02:17:20.165 --> 02:17:22.434
OF STAY AND WHETHER THERE WERE

02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:23.635
ADEQUATE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED

02:17:23.702 --> 02:17:25.270
THERE. THERE ARE EIGHT COUNTIES

02:17:25.337 --> 02:17:26.738
THAT CONTINUE TO OPERATE A

02:17:26.805 --> 02:17:28.873
MODIFIED TEMPORARY TEN DAY

02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:31.109
SHELTER TYPE FACILITY FOR MOST

02:17:31.176 --> 02:17:33.211
NO LONGER HAVE THE FACILITY. SO

02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:34.512
WHAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN IN RECENT

02:17:34.579 --> 02:17:36.081
YEARS IS THAT YES CHILDREN

02:17:36.147 --> 02:17:38.049
BECOME INDICATOR UNEXPECTEDLY

02:17:38.116 --> 02:17:39.117
BUT ALSO WE HAVE COUNTIES

02:17:39.184 --> 02:17:40.518
REPORTING A GROWING NUMBER OF

02:17:40.585 --> 02:17:42.787
SITUATIONS. WHERE YOU HAVE TO

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:44.356
HAVE THE MOST COMPLEX NEEDS.

02:17:44.422 --> 02:17:46.091
THAT ARE IN A PARTICULAR PLACE

02:17:46.157 --> 02:17:47.192
AND OFTEN A CONGREGATE CARE

02:17:47.259 --> 02:17:49.361
PLACEMENTS HAVE AN INCIDENT OR

02:17:49.427 --> 02:17:50.862
DISAGREEMENT OF HER. AND AS A

02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:52.731
RESULT THE CAREGIVER OR PROVIDER

02:17:52.797 --> 02:17:54.432
ASKED THE COUNTY TO COME AND GET

02:17:54.499 --> 02:17:56.001
THE YOUTH LITTLE NOTICE. AND

02:17:56.067 --> 02:17:57.335
MANY COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING TO

02:17:57.402 --> 02:17:58.536
FIND A QUICK ALTERNATIVE

02:17:58.603 --> 02:18:00.372
PLACEMENT FOR TREATMENT AND

02:18:00.438 --> 02:18:01.973
SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE. YOU HAVE

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:04.209
AS A RESULT. OF THE SITUATION

02:18:04.275 --> 02:18:05.810
FOR YOU BECAUSE I COUNTY OFFICE

02:18:05.877 --> 02:18:07.545
OR IN A HOTEL WITH TWENTY FOUR

02:18:07.612 --> 02:18:10.015
SEVEN. SOCIAL WORKER SUPPORT.

02:18:10.081 --> 02:18:11.516
BUT NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE THESE

02:18:11.583 --> 02:18:13.418
PLACES HAPPENED THIS IS NOT A

02:18:13.485 --> 02:18:14.586
PLACE WHERE TREATMENT AND

02:18:14.653 --> 02:18:15.954
HEALING CAN HAPPEN THESE ARE NOT

02:18:16.021 --> 02:18:17.922
PLACES THAT WE CAN LIKE THAT. OR

02:18:17.989 --> 02:18:19.824
THAT WE WANT TO PLACE CHILDREN.

02:18:19.891 --> 02:18:21.393
SO WE PROPOSE THAT WE WORK

02:18:21.459 --> 02:18:22.560
TOGETHER WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND

02:18:22.627 --> 02:18:24.396
OTHER AGENCIES THAT SERVE. OUR

02:18:24.462 --> 02:18:25.864
CHILDREN AND USE THAT JUST

02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:27.332
COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THE

02:18:27.399 --> 02:18:28.466
REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE

02:18:28.533 --> 02:18:30.869
EDUCATION SYSTEM TO TRY TO

02:18:30.935 --> 02:18:32.671
DEVELOP MORE OPTIONS. WHAT I

02:18:32.737 --> 02:18:33.938
ACTUALLY THINK WORTH EXPLORING

02:18:34.005 --> 02:18:35.607
IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT WE'RE

02:18:35.674 --> 02:18:37.876
CALLING AN INTENSIVE. ASSESSMENT

02:18:37.942 --> 02:18:39.611
TRANSITIONAL TYPE OF FACILITY OR

02:18:39.678 --> 02:18:41.713
HOME. THESE ARE THE SHORT TERM

02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:44.449
SERVICE RICH JOINTLY STAFFED BY

02:18:44.516 --> 02:18:45.250
THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT I

02:18:45.316 --> 02:18:48.653
MENTIONED. WHILE WE- AND SO THEY

02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:49.854
WOULD ENSURE THAT SERVICES ARE

02:18:49.921 --> 02:18:52.323
ACTUALLY PROVIDED WHILE CATHOLIC

02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:54.526
COUNTY CHILD WELFARE AGENCY. IS

02:18:54.592 --> 02:18:56.695
WORKING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I

02:18:56.761 --> 02:18:59.030
GOT. APPROPRIATE SAKE ONGOING

02:18:59.097 --> 02:19:08.273
PLACE. SO WE THINK THAT IN

02:19:08.339 --> 02:19:09.507
ADDITION TO SOME OF THESE COUNTY

02:19:09.574 --> 02:19:11.242
BAY. TYPES OF HOME WE WERE ALSO

02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:12.744
BETTER. FROM WORKING WITH THE

02:19:12.811 --> 02:19:14.179
STATE TO IF WE DEVELOP. A OF

02:19:14.245 --> 02:19:16.181
REACH OF OMAHA AS WELL NOT A

02:19:16.247 --> 02:19:17.882
COUNTY COULD RELEASE- THAT THAT

02:19:17.949 --> 02:19:19.617
TIME KIND OF. WE ALSO THINK MORE

02:19:19.684 --> 02:19:21.619
WORK NEEDS TO DONE TO A PLACE

02:19:21.686 --> 02:19:22.687
SURVEY. MUCH MORE QUICKLY WHEN A

02:19:22.754 --> 02:19:24.856
CHILD IS BORN UNTO CARE. THIS

02:19:24.923 --> 02:19:25.523
WOULD INCLUDE BUT NOT BE LIMITED

02:19:25.590 --> 02:19:26.458
TO. SUPPORTING FAMILIES WHO

02:19:26.524 --> 02:19:28.393
AGREED TO ACCEPT YOU FROM LITTLE

02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:29.794
NOTICE. THIS COULD BE SOMETHING

02:19:29.861 --> 02:19:31.162
WE COULD USE FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:19:31.229 --> 02:19:32.630
PEPPERS FUNDING THAT I MENTIONED

02:19:32.697 --> 02:19:33.932
FOR WE ALSO TO LOOK AT

02:19:33.998 --> 02:19:34.933
RESTRUCTURING THE NAME OF

02:19:34.999 --> 02:19:35.633
COUNTIES TO PARTNER. WITH

02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:37.068
RESOURCE FAMILIES TO HOLD

02:19:37.135 --> 02:19:38.603
EMERGENCY PLACEMENTS AVAILABLE

02:19:38.670 --> 02:19:41.506
FOR COUNTY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT I

02:19:41.573 --> 02:19:44.375
FUNDING RFA THAT IS THE PROCESS

02:19:44.442 --> 02:19:46.411
THAT BEGAN AS A SHORT NOTED.

02:19:46.478 --> 02:19:49.447
THAT HE MET. PRIOR TO APPROVAL

02:19:49.514 --> 02:19:51.850
FOR RELATIVES. AND SO ALLOWING

02:19:51.916 --> 02:19:53.084
GROWERS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY

02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:55.153
TOGETHER FUNDING SUPPORT. WE

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:56.955
NEED TO HAVE ADEQUATE RFA STAFF

02:19:57.021 --> 02:19:58.590
TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN BEGIN AND

02:19:58.656 --> 02:20:00.992
COMPLETE THE PROCESS TIMELY. AS

02:20:01.059 --> 02:20:02.527
YOU HERE THERE IS A CERTAIN

02:20:02.594 --> 02:20:04.229
POINT AT WHICH THE FUNDING IF

02:20:04.295 --> 02:20:05.764
THAT TO TURN OFF IF IT CHANGES

02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:08.233
NOT MAY. AND THEN FINALLY FAMILY

02:20:08.299 --> 02:20:09.934
FINDING AND GIVEN SUPPORT WHAT

02:20:10.001 --> 02:20:11.369
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT A FEW TIMES

02:20:11.436 --> 02:20:12.971
ON THESE FIRST TWO CANDLES.

02:20:13.037 --> 02:20:14.773
THERE'S A REALLY GREAT VALUE OF

02:20:14.839 --> 02:20:16.307
THIS HOW DO YOU THINK IN THE

02:20:16.374 --> 02:20:18.209
SEARCH AS SOON AS THE UTERUS

02:20:18.276 --> 02:20:19.744
CARE. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

02:20:19.811 --> 02:20:21.279
EVIDENCE BASED MODELS ONE THAT

02:20:21.346 --> 02:20:23.248
WE KNOW OF THAT A LOT OF COUNTY

02:20:23.314 --> 02:20:24.983
USE OF CALLED THIRTY DAYS TO

02:20:25.049 --> 02:20:25.583
FAMILY. PROGRAMS LIKE THIS

02:20:25.650 --> 02:20:27.585
PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR SEARCHING

02:20:27.652 --> 02:20:29.120
AND SUPPORTING RELATED FAMILY

02:20:29.187 --> 02:20:30.922
MEMBERS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW

02:20:30.989 --> 02:20:32.590
THAT JUST FINDING A PERSON IS

02:20:32.657 --> 02:20:34.826
NOT ENOUGH. AT THAT POINT YOU

02:20:34.893 --> 02:20:36.127
ALSO NEED TO ENGAGE WITH THEM.

02:20:36.194 --> 02:20:37.929
THEY MAY NOT KNOW THAT THEY EVEN

02:20:37.996 --> 02:20:40.098
HAVE A RELATIVE. WHO IT HAS A

02:20:40.165 --> 02:20:42.033
CHILD AND A CHILD WHO HAS BEEN

02:20:42.100 --> 02:20:44.469
BROUGHT IN THE FOSTER CARE DUE

02:20:44.536 --> 02:20:46.204
TO ABUSE OR NEGLECT OR BOTH. AND

02:20:46.271 --> 02:20:48.206
SO REACHING OUT IT'S SOMETHING

02:20:48.273 --> 02:20:50.742
THAT- WE HAVE TO DO WHAT I

02:20:50.809 --> 02:20:52.577
REALLY A THOUGHTFUL WAY. TO

02:20:52.644 --> 02:20:55.213
EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:57.515
FAMILY I TRIED SHE BROKE MAKE A

02:20:57.582 --> 02:20:58.016
CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT

02:20:58.082 --> 02:21:00.118
RELATIVE. AND THAT CHILD ABUSE.

02:21:00.185 --> 02:21:09.227
EVEN. IF IT DOESN'T RESULT IN A

02:21:09.294 --> 02:21:11.196
PLACE. WE WERE STILL WANT TO

02:21:11.262 --> 02:21:12.497
POTENTIAL PRESERVE AFTER THAT.

02:21:12.564 --> 02:21:14.165
AND SO FOR FINE HAVE A LOT OF

02:21:14.232 --> 02:21:15.800
DIFFERENT LAYERS TO IT NOT JUST

02:21:15.867 --> 02:21:16.835
I KNOW RELATIVE. SPEAKING WORKED

02:21:16.901 --> 02:21:18.303
OUT. THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE

02:21:18.369 --> 02:21:19.537
WITH THESE. TO ENSURE THAT THEY

02:21:19.604 --> 02:21:21.973
WERE STEP IN. AND BECOME A KEY.

02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:23.308
THAT FOR THE YOU. AND SO WE ARE.

02:21:23.374 --> 02:21:24.676
INVESTMENT OF FIFTEEN POINT YOU.

02:21:24.742 --> 02:21:26.211
GENERAL FUND TO HELP DIRECTLY

02:21:26.277 --> 02:21:27.245
THIS WORKING WHICH WOULD BE NEW

02:21:27.312 --> 02:21:29.347
FUNDING AT THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY

02:21:29.414 --> 02:21:31.249
DIRECTLY FUND- OUT WITH THAT. I

02:21:31.316 --> 02:21:32.684
WILL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS ON THE

02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:33.985
THREE QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR

DO IT- WHICH IS NOT A GREAT

02:48:49.586 --> 02:48:51.120
REMEDY IN THIS CASE BECAUSE

02:49:07.237 --> 02:49:08.905
PROCESS AND THAT SPENDING THAT

02:49:08.972 --> 02:49:10.640

02:49:13.576 --> 02:49:15.979
OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE KNOW

02:49:16.045 --> 02:49:17.313
THAT COUNTIES ARE SPENDING A

02:49:17.380 --> 02:49:19.115
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

02:49:19.182 --> 02:49:20.917

ENHANCING OUR TRAINING- I WILL

03:05:24.680 --> 03:05:26.348
ASK THREE FINAL QUESTIONS MY

03:05:26.415 --> 03:05:27.616
NEXT QUESTION IS FROM THE

03:05:27.683 --> 03:05:30.919
SANDERLING MCDONALD- WE HEARD

03:05:30.986 --> 03:05:33.889
ABOUT THE SS I APPEALS PROCESS

03:05:33.956 --> 03:05:36.692
AND- I'M HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT

03:05:36.758 --> 03:05:37.993
ON WHETHER OR NOT THOSE SAME

03:05:38.060 --> 03:05:40.462
SOCIAL WORKERS CAN. MAKE SIMILAR

03:05:40.529 --> 03:05:43.398
INQUIRIES FOR OTHER STATE SAFETY

03:05:43.465 --> 03:05:45.601
NET PROGRAM SUCH AS CALFRESH FOR

03:05:45.667 --> 03:05:48.203
MEDIC CAL- AND IF SO WITHOUT

03:05:48.270 --> 03:05:49.671
REQUIRING QUICK INCREASED

03:05:49.738 --> 03:05:52.808
RESOURCE IN JUST WANT TO GET

03:05:52.875 --> 03:05:55.077
YOUR OPINION ON THAT. THAT'S A

03:05:55.143 --> 03:05:57.246
REALLY GREAT QUESTION- SHERRIN

03:05:57.312 --> 03:06:00.716
I- I MEAN EMPIRICALLY YES OF

03:06:00.782 --> 03:06:02.351
COURSE THEY COULD DO THAT WORK I

03:06:02.417 --> 03:06:04.553
WOULD SAY. FOLLOWING UP TO TALK

03:06:04.620 --> 03:06:06.388
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT

03:06:06.455 --> 03:06:08.390
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA- COUPLE

03:06:08.457 --> 03:06:11.593
THOUGHTS ON THAT IS THAT- AS WE

03:06:11.660 --> 03:06:13.595
THINK ABOUT YOUTH TRANSITIONING

03:06:13.662 --> 03:06:15.931
INTO EXTENDED FOSTER CARE WE

03:06:15.998 --> 03:06:18.267
KNOW THAT THEY DO CONTINUE TO

03:06:18.333 --> 03:06:20.402
HAVE SOCIAL WORK SUPPORT. AND SO

03:06:20.469 --> 03:06:22.804
SOME OF THAT MAY BE DONE IN THAT

03:06:22.871 --> 03:06:26.174
WAY ALREADY BUT I WOULD SAY WE

03:06:26.241 --> 03:06:27.976
KNOW THAT THE INDEPENDENT LIVING

03:06:28.043 --> 03:06:30.779
PROGRAMS THAT EXIST IN ALL IN

03:06:30.846 --> 03:06:33.315
ALL COUNTIES BUT VERY GREATLY

03:06:33.382 --> 03:06:35.017
BECAUSE THEY HAVE VERY DIFFERENT

03:06:35.083 --> 03:06:37.352
RESOURCES. AT THEIR DISPOSAL

03:06:37.419 --> 03:06:40.923
BOTH THE FUNDING BUT ALSO WHAT

03:06:40.989 --> 03:06:44.092
KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS COMPANIES

03:06:44.159 --> 03:06:46.028
ARE LOCATED IN THOSE COUNTIES

03:06:46.094 --> 03:06:48.397
YOU MAY HAVE A LARGE FORTUNE

03:06:48.463 --> 03:06:49.631
FIVE HUNDRED COMPANY AND A

03:06:49.698 --> 03:06:52.568
LARGER COUNTY THAT CAN DONATE-

03:06:52.634 --> 03:06:56.538
COMPUTERS OR DONATE- GIFT CARDS.

03:06:56.605 --> 03:06:58.840
INTENDED TO USE AND DO SO AS A

03:06:58.907 --> 03:07:00.542
MATTER OF COURSE AND THE SMALLER

03:07:00.609 --> 03:07:02.444
COUNTY YOU JUST MAY NOT HAVE

03:07:02.511 --> 03:07:04.780
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO- WHAT

03:07:04.846 --> 03:07:07.249
WE'VE SEEN OVER TIME IS. A GREAT

03:07:07.316 --> 03:07:09.251
DIFFERENCE IN BOTH THE RESOURCES

03:07:09.318 --> 03:07:11.420
BUT ALSO THE TYPES OF SERVICES

03:07:11.486 --> 03:07:13.388
AND SUPPORTS THAT YOU GET FROM

03:07:13.455 --> 03:07:15.290
THESE PROGRAMS DEPENDING ON

03:07:15.357 --> 03:07:17.326
WHERE THEY LIVE. AND SO PART OF

03:07:17.392 --> 03:07:18.927
THE CONVERSATION AND ANSWER THE

03:07:18.994 --> 03:07:20.829
QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED I THINK

03:07:20.896 --> 03:07:22.764
IS TO LOOK AT THAT PROGRAM WHICH

03:07:22.831 --> 03:07:24.900
WERE SUGGESTING REALLY NEEDS TO

03:07:24.967 --> 03:07:26.635
BE DONE AT THIS POINT- THE

03:07:26.702 --> 03:07:28.203
FAMILY FIRST- PREVENTION

03:07:28.270 --> 03:07:30.205
SERVICES ACT HAS A PROVISION AND

03:07:30.272 --> 03:07:32.341
THAT THAT MAKES SOME CHANGES. TO

03:07:32.407 --> 03:07:33.976
THE IOP PROGRAM WHICH HAS SOME

03:07:34.042 --> 03:07:35.844
FEDERAL FUNDING AND WE THINK

03:07:35.911 --> 03:07:36.912
THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

03:07:36.979 --> 03:07:38.914
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TAKE A

03:07:38.981 --> 03:07:40.916
LOOK AT THE MODEL AND SEE WHAT

03:07:40.983 --> 03:07:42.217
WE COULD DO TO BETTER SUPPORT

03:07:42.284 --> 03:07:44.653
YOUTH AS THEY'RE TRANSITIONING-

03:07:44.720 --> 03:07:45.487
THAT THE FACT THAT WERE

03:07:45.554 --> 03:07:46.855
PARTNERING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:07:46.922 --> 03:07:49.091
FULLY ON. IN ADDITION TO LOOKING

03:07:49.157 --> 03:07:51.526
AT HOW WE CAN GET A MORE HOUSING

03:07:51.593 --> 03:07:56.298
RESOURCES. TO ARGUE WITH THE

03:07:56.365 --> 03:07:57.733
TRANSITIONAL HOW. IS SO A I

03:07:57.799 --> 03:07:59.267
COULD PIECE WE KNOW. AND HAVE

03:07:59.334 --> 03:08:01.436
THIS AND COMMITTEE- IN THE PAST

03:08:01.503 --> 03:08:03.205
HOW ARE YOU REALLY STRUGGLE TO

03:08:03.271 --> 03:08:05.474
STAY HOW IS THEY THEY HAVE A LOT

03:08:05.540 --> 03:08:07.376
OF HOUSING AND SECURITY AND SO I

03:08:07.442 --> 03:08:09.211
THINK ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS TO

03:08:09.277 --> 03:08:11.046
MERE OTHER PIECE. AND THAT THERE

03:08:11.113 --> 03:08:12.247
ARE SOME WAYS THAT WE CAN WORK

03:08:12.314 --> 03:08:14.516
TOGETHER TO THINK ABOUT ALL THE

03:08:14.583 --> 03:08:15.517
BEST WAY TO SUPPORT OUR YOUTH

03:08:15.584 --> 03:08:17.285
AND WORK WITH THEM AS THEY ARE

03:08:17.352 --> 03:08:18.787
MOVING. IDEALLY TOWARD EXTENDED

03:08:18.854 --> 03:08:20.922
FOSTER CARE UP TO AGE TWENTY ONE

03:08:20.989 --> 03:08:22.624
BUT SOME TO DROP OFF AT AGE

03:08:22.691 --> 03:08:23.325
EIGHTEEN THEY DON'T UNDER

03:08:23.392 --> 03:08:24.960
EXTENDED FOSTER CARE AND THEN

03:08:25.027 --> 03:08:26.628
AGAIN AT AGE TWENTY ONE.

03:08:26.695 --> 03:08:28.563
EXTENDED FOSTER CARE AND SO WITH

03:08:28.630 --> 03:08:29.665
A COUPLE DIFFERENT POINTS IN

03:08:29.731 --> 03:08:32.501
TIME WHERE BENEFITS I ADVOCACY

03:08:32.567 --> 03:08:34.670
PROBABLY YOU KNOW KIND OF CAN

03:08:34.736 --> 03:08:35.337
DOVETAIL WITH SOME OF THESE

03:08:35.404 --> 03:08:37.472
OTHER EFFORTS AS LONG AND HAPPY

IS REFERENCED IN THE AGENDA.

03:08:57.693 --> 03:09:00.262

LEVEL OF CARE TOOL. WITH THE

03:09:05.934 --> 03:09:07.969

03:33:10.277 --> 03:33:11.845
THE END ALL BE ALL THE ORIGINAL

03:33:11.912 --> 03:33:14.715
LEGISLATION THAT WE SAW WHEN IT

03:33:14.781 --> 03:33:15.249
WAS UNDER DISCUSSION T THE

03:33:15.315 --> 03:33:17.384
FEDERAL LEVEL. IN A MUCH MORE

03:33:17.451 --> 03:33:18.952
ROBUST SET OF SERVICES AND WE

03:33:19.019 --> 03:33:20.687
KNOW THAT PREVENTION SERVICES GO

03:33:20.754 --> 03:33:22.089
WELL BEYOND MENTAL HEALTH

03:33:22.156 --> 03:33:23.724
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND IN

03:33:23.790 --> 03:33:25.592
HOME PARENTING SERVICES THERE'S-

03:33:25.659 --> 03:33:27.394
A WHOLE LOT MORE SERVICES THAT A

03:33:27.461 --> 03:33:30.130
FAMILY COULD NEED. IN ORDER TO

03:33:30.197 --> 03:33:32.099
AVOID NOT JUST TO BE SURE TO

03:33:32.166 --> 03:33:33.700
COLLECT BUT LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO

03:33:33.767 --> 03:33:34.668
DO HERE AVOID FOSTER CARE

03:33:34.735 --> 03:33:37.738
PLACEMENT. AND SO WHAT WE WANT

03:33:37.804 --> 03:33:39.773
TO TRY TO DO WITH THIS PROPOSAL.

03:33:39.840 --> 03:33:42.009
IS TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING

03:33:42.075 --> 03:33:44.645
CAN BE USED NOT JUST FOR THOSE

03:33:44.711 --> 03:33:47.414
CLEARING HOUSE. FEDERALLY

03:33:47.481 --> 03:33:50.083

DRIED OUT TITLE FOR EACH FOR.

03:33:52.119 --> 03:33:54.755
THEIR SERVICES TO AND FOR THE

03:33:54.821 --> 03:33:55.556
GENERAL FUND AND HOW IT WAS

03:33:55.622 --> 03:33:56.690
STRUCTURED IN THE CURRENT YEAR

03:33:56.757 --> 03:33:58.759
BUDGET ALLOWS COUNTIES TO DO

03:33:58.825 --> 03:34:01.094
THIS. THE IDEA IS TO PARTNER

03:34:01.161 --> 03:34:03.130
WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES LOCAL

03:34:03.197 --> 03:34:05.098
ORGANIZATIONS FAMILIES AND

03:34:05.165 --> 03:34:06.567
INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED

03:34:06.633 --> 03:34:08.802
EXPERIENCE. AND REALLY TRY TO

03:34:08.869 --> 03:34:10.971
TACKLE THE DISPARITIES AND THE

03:34:11.038 --> 03:34:13.006
DISPROPORTIONATE ALITY THAT YOU

03:34:13.073 --> 03:34:19.580

03:34:19.646 --> 03:34:20.614
WE TALKED ABOUT LAST YEAR AS

03:34:20.681 --> 03:34:22.149
WELL. WE ARE YOU KNOW THE- WE

03:34:22.216 --> 03:34:24.284

03:34:24.351 --> 03:34:26.086
OF THE CLIPBOARD SAY WE KNOW

03:34:26.153 --> 03:34:27.287
WHAT YOU NEED TO COMMUNITY BUT

03:34:27.354 --> 03:34:28.222
INSTEAD TO REALLY PARTNER

03:34:28.288 --> 03:34:28.689
MEANINGFULLY IN THOSE

03:34:28.755 --> 03:34:30.557

CREATE NEW SERVICES AND MAKE

03:34:40.634 --> 03:34:42.269
SURE THAT THEY'RE CULTURALLY

03:34:42.336 --> 03:34:44.171
RELEVANT EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT ON

03:34:44.238 --> 03:34:46.406
THAT CLEARING HOUSE LIST IDEALLY

03:34:46.473 --> 03:34:47.741
WE COULD TRY TO HELP BUILD THAT

03:34:47.808 --> 03:34:49.743
DATA. AND BUILD THAT SORT OF

03:34:49.810 --> 03:34:51.278
RESEARCH BASE TO BE ABLE TO

03:34:51.345 --> 03:34:52.646
EVENTUALLY GET PROGRAMS LIKE

03:34:52.713 --> 03:34:54.348

AND PUT INTO PLAY AND THAT'S

03:34:58.852 --> 03:35:02.055
AVAILABLE NOW- OR SOON WE HOPE

03:35:02.122 --> 03:35:04.157
IS GOING TO ENABLE US TO NOT

03:35:04.224 --> 03:35:05.993
JUST DRIED OUT FOR EACH. ONLY

03:35:06.059 --> 03:35:07.594
FOR THE LIMITED SERVICES BUT TO

03:35:07.661 --> 03:35:09.963
DO A MUCH BROADER- APPROACH TO

03:35:10.030 --> 03:35:13.000
PREVENTION. OF THAT WE THINK IS

03:35:13.066 --> 03:35:14.868
REALLY THE BETTER WAY TO GO. AND

03:35:14.935 --> 03:35:17.437
SO- KIND OF WHERE WE ARE I MEAN

03:35:17.504 --> 03:35:18.705

03:35:23.043 --> 03:35:24.378
KNOW WHAT IT TAKES MORE TIME TO

03:35:24.444 --> 03:35:26.680
GET MONEY OUT THE DOOR THERE

03:35:26.747 --> 03:35:27.547
WERE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS IN

03:35:27.614 --> 03:35:29.349
CHILD WELFARE- AND WE DID NEED

03:35:29.416 --> 03:35:31.218
TO GET OUR PREVENTION PLAN

03:35:31.285 --> 03:35:32.085
APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL

03:35:32.152 --> 03:35:34.187
GOVERNMENT. BUT IT IS MARCH AND

03:35:34.254 --> 03:35:35.489
SO WE ARE VERY MUCH LOOKING

03:35:35.555 --> 03:35:37.391
FORWARD TO SEEING THE MATERIALS

03:35:37.457 --> 03:35:40.294

03:35:43.397 --> 03:35:45.132
ABILITY TO TALK TO CLAIM TITLE

03:35:45.198 --> 03:35:47.434
FOR HE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT

03:35:47.501 --> 03:35:49.169
THE CARE SYSTEM IS NOT THERE

03:35:49.236 --> 03:35:53.240
YET- IT'S A COMPLICATED SET OF-

03:35:53.307 --> 03:35:56.910
CLAIMING TO REALLY AUTOMATE. BUT

03:35:56.977 --> 03:35:58.945
WE CAN GET GOING ON THIS WE

03:35:59.012 --> 03:36:01.581
DON'T HAVE TO JUST WAIT FOR CARE

03:36:01.648 --> 03:36:03.550
AND WAIT UNTIL WE CAN PLAN FOR

03:36:03.617 --> 03:36:05.252
EACH. COUNTIES CAN START WORKING

03:36:05.319 --> 03:36:07.821

03:36:29.943 --> 03:36:31.478
AVOID FOSTER CARE- I'LL JUST

03:36:31.545 --> 03:36:34.881
SAY- WAFTING ON THIS PART ONE

03:36:34.948 --> 03:36:36.883
QUESTION. IS WE CERTAINLY WOULD

03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:38.452

WHAT WOULD NOT BE IDEAL THE

03:36:48.428 --> 03:36:51.598
IDEAL IS TO GET CARE- PROGRAMS.

03:36:51.665 --> 03:36:53.867
THERE'S A LOT TO DO ONE CARES

03:36:53.934 --> 03:36:55.836
AND- PROGRAMMING DOESN'T HAPPEN

03:36:55.902 --> 03:36:58.305
OVERNIGHT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

03:36:58.372 --> 03:36:59.973
WE COULD HELP TO CREATE THAT

03:37:00.040 --> 03:37:01.875
INTERIM SOLUTION. TO NOT ONLY

03:37:01.942 --> 03:37:03.877
STANDS THE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS

YOUTH AND FAMILIES TO RECEIVE

04:19:09.333 --> 04:19:11.369
CONTINUITY OF SERVICES SO

04:19:11.435 --> 04:19:12.470
ANOTHER INVESTMENT THAT WAS

04:19:12.536 --> 04:19:13.671
INSTITUTED WAS A PROGRAM

04:19:13.738 --> 04:19:15.273

CREATED A MENTOR SHIP PROGRAM

04:19:25.383 --> 04:19:27.551
THAT PROVED TO BE VALUABLE AND

04:19:27.618 --> 04:19:28.886
ALSO REDUCE TURNOVER WHICH

04:19:28.953 --> 04:19:30.721
ULTIMATELY PROVIDED BETTER

04:19:30.788 --> 04:19:32.990
CONTINUITY OF SERVICES WE HAVE

04:19:33.057 --> 04:19:34.292

FOR ALL. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF AN

04:19:40.064 --> 04:19:41.666
INVESTMENT THAT TRULY MADE A

04:19:41.732 --> 04:19:43.301
DIFFERENCE WITH THE MOU BETWEEN

04:19:52.910 --> 04:19:54.745
CALLS TOGETHER. THIS PROVED TO

04:19:54.812 --> 04:19:56.447
BE BENEFICIAL ON A NUMBER OF

04:19:56.514 --> 04:19:58.115
LEVELS AGAIN THE SOCIAL WORKER

04:19:58.182 --> 04:19:59.450
WAS SUPPORTED WITH THE

04:19:59.517 --> 04:20:01.085
ASSISTANCE FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH

04:20:01.152 --> 04:20:02.920

SOME CASES ENSURE THAT FAMILIES

04:20:07.391 --> 04:20:08.392

NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT WERE

04:20:13.297 --> 04:20:17.335
BROUGHT INTO CARE. HAVING THE

ABILITY TO IDENTIFY I AM. RAPPER

LEADS TO BETTER OUTCOMES FOR

SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO

04:20:31.215 --> 04:20:33.551
INDEPENDENCE. THESE ARE JUST A

04:20:33.617 --> 04:20:34.552
FEW EXAMPLES TO ADD TO THE ONCE

04:20:34.618 --> 04:20:37.088
AGAIN THEM AS PRIOR INDICATED-

04:20:37.154 --> 04:20:37.922
EARLIER AND TOGETHER THESE

04:20:37.989 --> 04:20:39.590
INVESTMENTS. DEMONSTRATE THE

04:20:39.657 --> 04:20:40.658
NEED AND IMPORTANCE FOR THE

04:20:40.725 --> 04:20:42.760
CONTINUED INVESTMENTS. L. A.

04:20:42.827 --> 04:20:45.296

04:20:55.239 --> 04:20:56.741
QUESTION IS WHAT ARE. YOUR

FUNDING IS NOT PROVIDED TO L. A.

04:21:00.811 --> 04:21:01.679

AND THE FAMILIES THAT THEY

04:21:04.682 --> 04:21:05.716

04:21:05.783 --> 04:21:07.585
SERVANTS THEIR PRIMARY GOAL AND

04:21:07.651 --> 04:21:09.353

04:21:11.122 --> 04:21:12.356
WHOLE. ABSENT THIS CONTINUED

04:21:12.423 --> 04:21:13.624
FUNDING THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

04:21:13.691 --> 04:21:15.326
THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT

04:21:15.393 --> 04:21:16.427
WOULD GO WITHOUT SERVICES AND

04:21:16.494 --> 04:21:18.329
THE EFFECTS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN

04:21:18.396 --> 04:21:20.398
THE NEAR TERM AND IN THE FUTURE.

04:21:20.464 --> 04:21:21.832
NOT HAVING ACCESS OR CONTACT

04:21:21.899 --> 04:21:23.401
WITH THE WORK WITH THE WORKER

04:21:23.467 --> 04:21:24.869
CAN BE HARMFUL TO THE CHILDREN

04:21:24.935 --> 04:21:26.203
SO THE CONTINUED FUNDING IN

04:21:26.270 --> 04:21:27.705
PARTNERSHIP WITH L. A. COUNTY.

04:21:27.772 --> 04:21:29.006
AS NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR

04:21:29.073 --> 04:21:31.142
CHILDREN. ARE WORKERS ARE ALSO

04:21:31.208 --> 04:21:33.010
WORRIED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IF WE

HAVE A REDUCTION IN STAFF. WILL

04:21:34.812 --> 04:21:36.414
CASELOADS RISE AGAIN WOULD BE

04:21:36.480 --> 04:21:38.382
HIGH TURNOVER BUT EVEN MORE THAN

04:21:38.449 --> 04:21:40.551
THAT IS WILL WE HAVE MORE ABUSED

04:21:40.618 --> 04:21:41.685

RECEIVING THE SERVICES. THEY

04:21:44.688 --> 04:21:46.490
NEED. SO I'LL JUST CONCLUDE THAT

04:21:46.557 --> 04:21:47.558
THE FUNDING IS NOT ONLY

04:21:47.625 --> 04:21:49.527

04:22:18.189 --> 04:22:19.790
ABOUT THE LONG TERM GOALS OF OUR

04:22:19.857 --> 04:22:21.559
SYSTEM OF CARE FOR YOUTH WITH

04:22:21.625 --> 04:22:24.462
COMPLEX NEEDS AND ALSO TALK A

04:22:24.528 --> 04:22:27.731
BIT ABOUT- TRANSITION AND OUR

CARE FOR YOUTH WITH THE MOST

04:22:38.375 --> 04:22:40.311
COMPLEX NEEDS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO

04:22:40.377 --> 04:22:42.947
UNDERSTAND THAT A COUPLE THINGS

04:22:43.013 --> 04:22:44.782
ONE WALKING A FEW WHO WITH THE

04:22:44.849 --> 04:22:46.650
MOST COMPLEX CARE NEEDS. ARE

04:22:46.717 --> 04:22:47.852
CERTAINLY NOT THE MAJORITY OF

04:22:47.918 --> 04:22:49.687
OUR YOUTH ARE THEY ARE SOME OF

04:22:49.753 --> 04:22:51.288
THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE MEMBERS

04:22:51.355 --> 04:22:53.157
SPEND THE MOST TIME WORKING WITH

04:22:57.695 --> 04:23:00.631
THAT THE NEEDS TO SERVE THESE

04:23:00.698 --> 04:23:02.600
ARE JUST THAT'S RELATIVELY SMALL

04:23:02.666 --> 04:23:05.136
BUT IMPORTANT POPULATION ARE NOT

04:23:05.202 --> 04:23:07.204
NEW AND THEY WERE CREATED BY THE

04:23:07.271 --> 04:23:09.640

AND HAVE GROWN IN IMPORTANCE AND

04:23:11.375 --> 04:23:13.644
VISIBILITY OVERTIME. I THINK AS

04:23:13.711 --> 04:23:15.813
WE UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE

04:23:15.880 --> 04:23:18.849

AND MORE THOROUGHLY THAN WE MAY

04:23:27.758 --> 04:23:30.261
HAVE IN THE PAST. I WILL SAY

04:23:30.327 --> 04:23:32.196
THAT THE ISSUE WAS ALSO

04:23:32.263 --> 04:23:34.398
EXACERBATED BY CCR THOUGH IN THE

04:23:34.465 --> 04:23:36.267
SENSE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

04:23:36.333 --> 04:23:38.469
THE C. R. AND TO SOME DEGREE

04:23:38.536 --> 04:23:40.271

SERVICE ACT IMPLEMENTATION HAS

04:23:44.441 --> 04:23:46.777
RESULTED IN FOR BETTER OR WORSE

04:23:46.844 --> 04:23:48.546
A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE

04:23:48.612 --> 04:23:50.714
NUMBER OF PROVIDERS WE HAVE FOR

PLACE THAT FAMILY REJECT

04:26:29.039 --> 04:26:31.075
RESPONSE SYSTEM THAT'S ROLLED

04:26:31.141 --> 04:26:32.976
OUT THAT STILL YOU KNOW IN ITS

04:26:33.043 --> 04:26:35.079
INFANCY BUT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING

04:26:35.145 --> 04:26:36.980
HUNDREDS OF CALLS TO THE

04:26:37.047 --> 04:26:39.516
HOTLINE. WHERE THESE TRAINED

04:26:39.583 --> 04:26:40.751
PROFESSIONALS CAN HELP TO

04:26:40.818 --> 04:26:42.619
DIFFUSE THE SITUATION SO THE

04:26:42.686 --> 04:26:44.388
CALL THE GO TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

04:26:44.455 --> 04:26:46.323

TO THAT SERIES OF A FEELING OF

04:26:53.997 --> 04:26:55.833
REJECTION AND FAILURE THAT WE

04:26:55.899 --> 04:26:58.035
KNOW SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL

04:26:58.102 --> 04:27:00.204
AND REALLY- INTERNALIZED. AND

04:27:00.270 --> 04:27:06.243
THAT HAPPENS WITH FURTHER. ALONG

04:27:06.310 --> 04:27:08.345
WITH THAT- AND SO. A COUPLE

04:27:08.412 --> 04:27:10.214
THINGS THAT I JUST TO SEE. WERE

04:27:10.280 --> 04:27:12.649
TO FUNDING THAT WAS FROM IN THE

04:27:12.716 --> 04:27:13.650
YEAR. FIRST REGARDING THE CHILD.

04:27:13.717 --> 04:27:15.819
FINDING WE'RE PROPOSING THAT THE

04:27:15.886 --> 04:27:18.522
PROCESS FOR COUNTIES TO BE ABLE

04:27:18.589 --> 04:27:20.290
TO SPEND THAT FUNDING BE I

04:27:20.357 --> 04:27:21.759
SWITCHED UP A LITTLE BIT.

04:27:21.825 --> 04:27:23.761
CURRENTLY THE PROCESS IS THAT

04:27:23.827 --> 04:27:26.397
THAT COUNTY BUT TO PUT A REQUEST

04:27:26.463 --> 04:27:28.132
IN THE STATE THAT MUST REVIEW

04:27:28.198 --> 04:27:29.900
AND APPROVE THE REQUEST AND ONLY

04:27:29.967 --> 04:27:31.101
AT THAT POINT YOU HAVE THAT

04:27:31.168 --> 04:27:33.404
COUNTY PROVIDE THOSE. SERVICES

04:27:33.470 --> 04:27:35.639
WITHOUT FINDING WE REALLY THINK

04:27:35.706 --> 04:27:38.041
THAT ACCOUNTABILITY IS CRITICAL

04:27:38.108 --> 04:27:39.843
HERE WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE NO ISSUE

04:27:39.910 --> 04:27:41.512
WITH ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT WE

04:27:41.578 --> 04:27:43.747
THINK THAT COUNTY THAT IS HAS A

04:27:43.814 --> 04:27:45.682
YEAR. WHO WAS IMMEDIATELY AT

04:27:45.749 --> 04:27:48.285
THAT MOMENT EXPERIENCING INDEED

04:27:48.352 --> 04:27:49.620
WHICH IS WHAT WE TYPICALLY HEAR

04:27:49.686 --> 04:27:51.722
ABOUT. SHOULD NOT HAVE TO ASK

04:27:51.789 --> 04:27:53.824
FOR PERMISSION TO PROVIDE

04:27:53.891 --> 04:27:55.192
SERVICES THAT YOU'VE EVEN THAT

04:27:55.259 --> 04:27:56.660
MOMENT AND THEN WAIT FOR

04:27:56.727 --> 04:27:58.362
APPROVAL WHETHER THAT'S A DAY OR

04:27:58.429 --> 04:28:00.397
WEEK IT'S STILL. THAT THE STATE

04:28:00.464 --> 04:28:02.533
NEED IS NOW AND SO WHAT WE'D

04:28:02.599 --> 04:28:04.568
LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN INSTEAD IS

04:28:04.635 --> 04:28:07.004
THAT COUNTIES UNDERSTAND WHAT

04:28:07.070 --> 04:28:09.273
THE FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR. AND

04:28:09.339 --> 04:28:11.308
THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO SPEND

04:28:11.375 --> 04:28:12.876
THOSE FUNDS PROVIDE THOSE

04:28:12.943 --> 04:28:14.545
SERVICES FOR THOSE USED AND THEN

04:28:14.611 --> 04:28:16.680
PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO THE

04:28:16.747 --> 04:28:18.482
STATE ON HOW THE FUNDS WERE USED

04:28:18.549 --> 04:28:20.517
IN FOR HOME AND WHY. SO IT'S AN

04:28:20.584 --> 04:28:21.919
AFTER THE FACT REPORT RATHER

04:28:21.985 --> 04:28:24.087
THAN A PERMISSION REQUEST THAT

04:28:24.154 --> 04:28:26.123
COULD DELAY THE PROVISION OF

04:28:26.190 --> 04:28:27.758
NEEDED SERVICES WE JUST. WE

04:28:27.825 --> 04:28:29.460
THINK THIS IS A SORT OF WHATEVER

04:28:29.526 --> 04:28:30.928
IT TAKES MOMENT EVERYTHING AT

04:28:30.994 --> 04:28:32.429
THE MOMENT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

04:28:32.496 --> 04:28:34.131
PROVIDE WHATEVER IT TAKES SO

04:28:34.198 --> 04:28:35.766
THAT'S- THAT'S ONE THING- WE

04:28:35.833 --> 04:28:38.302
ALSO. ARE REVIEWING YOUR HEAD OF

04:28:38.368 --> 04:28:40.237
WHAT IT IS THAT COUNTIES OF

04:28:40.304 --> 04:28:41.572
REQUESTED WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN A

04:28:41.638 --> 04:28:43.874
LOUDER OR QUESTION. I KNOW THAT

04:28:43.941 --> 04:28:45.476
MOST OF WHAT'S BEEN ASKED FOR

04:28:45.542 --> 04:28:46.844
HAVE BEEN APPROVED BUT WE THINK

04:28:46.910 --> 04:28:49.213
THAT IT MAY BE ON THE NEEDED FOR

04:28:49.279 --> 04:28:51.682
US TO BROADEN. OUR THE STATUTORY

04:28:51.748 --> 04:28:53.684
LANGUAGE A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT

04:28:53.750 --> 04:28:54.651
THE WHAT THE FUNDING COULD BE

04:28:54.718 --> 04:28:56.620
USED FOR SO WE'LL FOLLOW UP

04:28:56.687 --> 04:28:58.188
WITH. THE STATEMENT THAT THE

04:28:58.255 --> 04:28:59.990
LEGISLATURE WITH YOUR COMMITTEE

04:29:00.057 --> 04:29:06.763
AND STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT WE.

04:29:06.830 --> 04:29:07.531
HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WE

04:29:07.598 --> 04:29:10.834
MOVE OUR WORK- AND THEN I JUST

04:29:10.901 --> 04:29:12.169
SORT OF ONE MORE THING TO IS

04:29:12.236 --> 04:29:13.504
THAT WE ARE COULD TO MONITOR

04:29:13.570 --> 04:29:15.739
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE YOUTH

04:29:15.806 --> 04:29:17.841
WHO CAME BACK INTO OUR STATE IN

04:29:17.908 --> 04:29:20.143
EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FROM THE

04:29:20.210 --> 04:29:21.812
OUT OF STATE CONGREGATE CARE

04:29:21.879 --> 04:29:24.781
FACILITIES YOU I'M SURE CALL A

04:29:24.848 --> 04:29:26.116
BIG TOPIC OF OUR CONVERSATION

04:29:26.183 --> 04:29:28.685
LAST YEAR WAS THAT- ALL OF THE

04:29:28.752 --> 04:29:29.753
OTHER THREE CONGREGATE

04:29:29.820 --> 04:29:31.355
FACILITIES WERE DECERTIFIED AT

04:29:31.421 --> 04:29:33.991
THE SAME TIME- A HUNDRED AND

04:29:34.057 --> 04:29:34.992
THIRTY THREE USED ACROSS CHILD

04:29:35.058 --> 04:29:36.927
WELFARE OR PROBATION WERE

04:29:36.994 --> 04:29:39.129
BROUGHT BACK TO CALIFORNIA. AND

04:29:39.196 --> 04:29:40.831
WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING WILL BE

04:29:40.898 --> 04:29:43.000
UNTIL DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY

04:29:43.066 --> 04:29:43.934
ONE WE WERE RECEIVING MONTHLY

04:29:44.001 --> 04:29:46.203
UPDATES ON THE FIELD AND WE DID

04:29:46.270 --> 04:29:49.239
SEE SHIPS OVER TIME FROM MANY OF

04:29:49.306 --> 04:29:50.874
THE YOUTH INITIALLY RETURNING TO

04:29:50.941 --> 04:29:52.543
RELATIVE PLACEMENTS

04:29:52.609 --> 04:29:55.112
UNFORTUNATELY THAT DROPPED FROM

04:29:55.178 --> 04:29:58.715
42% 226% OF THE PLACEMENTS WHICH

04:29:58.782 --> 04:30:00.751
WAS THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE

04:30:00.817 --> 04:30:03.287
DECREASE OF A CATEGORY- AND IT

04:30:03.353 --> 04:30:04.655
LOOKED LIKE IT THOSE YOUTH ENDED

04:30:04.721 --> 04:30:06.857
UP I'M GOING TO CONGREGATE CARE

04:30:06.924 --> 04:30:08.692
JUVENILE HALL OBVIOUSLY NOT

04:30:08.759 --> 04:30:10.727
IDEAL SHELTER FACILITIES YOU

04:30:10.794 --> 04:30:12.863
KNOW NOT EVERY COUNTY HAS AGAIN

04:30:12.930 --> 04:30:14.798
ALSO NOT AT A PERMANENT TYPE OF

04:30:14.865 --> 04:30:17.434
PLACEMENT. FOR UNFORTUNATELY-

04:30:17.501 --> 04:30:19.436
THEY THEY ARE NOT IN PLACE WE

04:30:19.503 --> 04:30:21.238
DON'T KNOW THEY RAN AWAY IN SOME

04:30:21.305 --> 04:30:23.540
WAY AND THAT OBVIOUSLY IS IT'S

04:30:23.607 --> 04:30:25.509
NOT WHAT WE WANT I MEAN THAT THE

04:30:25.576 --> 04:30:31.348
CONCERN. I THINK IS THAT- WE

04:30:31.415 --> 04:30:32.516
DON'T THINK THE YOUTH ARRESTED

04:30:32.583 --> 04:30:34.251
FOR GETTING WHAT THEY NEED. WE

04:30:34.318 --> 04:30:35.619
HAVE GIVEN WILL BE WORK WITH TO

04:30:35.686 --> 04:30:37.988
TRY MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN- WORK

04:30:38.055 --> 04:30:39.022
TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY PLACEMENT

04:30:39.089 --> 04:30:40.724
OPTIONS WE APPRECIATE THAT THE

04:30:40.791 --> 04:30:42.960
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. ON THAT IN

04:30:43.026 --> 04:30:44.695
OUR STATE PARTNERS PROVIDE I

04:30:44.761 --> 04:30:47.064
THINK AT TIMES- ROLLING UP OUR

04:30:47.130 --> 04:30:49.733
SLEEVES A LITTLE MORE AND MAYBE-

04:30:49.800 --> 04:30:52.436
REALLY. HAVING THAT- GO TO A
