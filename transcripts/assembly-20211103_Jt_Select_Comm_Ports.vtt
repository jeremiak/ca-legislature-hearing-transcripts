00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:12.149
LOGISTICAL SORT OF ISSUES WITH

00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:14.318
THAT- REGARDING RELATIONSHIPS

00:49:14.384 --> 00:49:15.852
AND SIZE OF SHIPS BUT I'M JUST

00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:19.089
WONDERING WHAT. COULD BE

00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:20.557
DISCUSSED IN THAT IN THAT SPACE.

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:23.694
ABSOLUTELY THE GOAL IS TO- ONE

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.829
OF THE GOALS IS TO KEEP A CARGO

00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:28.465
COMINGTO CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:30.100
KEEP THE AVAILABILITY OF

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:31.902
CONTAINERS I ENTITIES FOR

00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:34.171
EXPORTERS TO PUT THEIR CARGO

00:49:34.237 --> 00:49:36.006
CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE CARDINAL

00:49:36.073 --> 00:49:38.075
INTO THOSE CONTENTIOUS TO ASIA.

00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:39.910
SO THAT'S OUR GOAL YOU AND

00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:41.678
CALIFORNIA PORTS. WHAT

00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:43.847
CURRENTLY IS HAPPENING IS THAT

00:49:43.914 --> 00:49:45.015
SOME OF THE CARGOES BEING

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:47.150
DIVERTED OF COURSE TO. OTHER

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:49.219
NON CALIFORNIA PORTS AND THAT'S

00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:50.954
ACTUALLY HAPPENING EVEN BEFORE

00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:52.956
THE PANDEMIC- SO THAT'S A

00:49:53.023 --> 00:49:55.258
DISTURBING TREND. BUT SECONDLY

00:49:55.325 --> 00:49:57.527
I DID CURRENTLY. SO I GUESS

00:49:57.594 --> 00:49:58.929
SAID THE PRICE DISTORTION IS

00:49:58.995 --> 00:50:01.064
SUCH THAT. THE CARGO A

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:03.600
COMMANDING SUCH PRICES THAT IS

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:06.236
IT IS- PROBABLY INCENTIVIZING.

00:50:06.303 --> 00:50:08.905
THE FAST MOVEMENTS. OF FAST

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:10.841
MOVING THE CARGO TURN AROUND TO

00:50:10.907 --> 00:50:12.476
GO BACK TO ASIA. SO WHAT'S

00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:14.411
HAPPENED IS SOME OF THOSE SHIPS

00:50:14.478 --> 00:50:16.012
IT SHIPPING LINES SO USED TO

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:17.647
CALL L. A. LONG BEACH FIRST.

00:50:17.714 --> 00:50:19.149
THE DROP OF KAGEL DESIGNATED

00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:20.817
FOR THAT POOR AND THEN GOLD IN

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:22.819
OAKLAND THE JUDGE DROPPED OFF A

FROM THE AG EXPO- INDUSTRY WILL

00:50:29.693 --> 00:50:31.294
GO BACK TO ASIA. NOW WHAT

00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:32.429
THEY'RE TRYING TO NOW THEY'RE

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:34.865
DOING IS SIMPLY DROPPING OFF

00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:36.433
THE CAR THE L. IN LONG BEACH.

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.268

AND THEN GOING BACK TO ASIA

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:43.673
DIRECTLY BUT THAT'S CAUSING IS

SYSTEM. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:54.678

OTHER. FOLKS TESTIFYING AFTER

00:51:57.013 --> 00:51:59.516
ME WILL BE GOING TO THIS ISSUE.

00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:01.251
BUT IMPORTANTLY AS WE SAID IT

00:52:01.318 --> 00:52:02.819
AS I STATED EVEN BEFORE THE

00:52:02.886 --> 00:52:05.455
ADAMIC WHAT IS STOPPING THAT-

00:52:05.522 --> 00:52:07.023
THERE ISN'T MUCH BETTER I

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:08.492
SHOULD I DON'T KNOW BETTER THE

00:52:08.558 --> 00:52:09.392
WORD BUT CERTAINLY MUCH MORE

00:52:09.459 --> 00:52:11.495
EMPHASIS. ON COORDINATED

00:52:11.561 --> 00:52:12.696
BETWEEN STATE GOVERNMENTS AND

00:52:12.762 --> 00:52:14.097
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:24.207
SORT OF AND MARKETING AND-

00:52:24.274 --> 00:52:28.144
MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE A-

00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:29.479
COORDINATED WAY OF HANDLING THE-

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:31.014
IN ADDITION GROWTH FOR THE

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:33.283

ALL POLL FOR EXAMPLE IN.

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:39.122
GEORGIA IN VIRGINIA ON THE

00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:41.625
FLORIDA AS WELL AS TEXAS. SO

00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:43.226
THAT INVESTMENT I GUESS I

00:52:43.293 --> 00:52:44.861
STATED MY TESTIMONY THERE'S A

00:52:44.928 --> 00:52:47.297
NEARLY ELEVEN TO ONE IMBALANCE

00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:48.765
BETWEEN WHAT'S THE INVESTMENT

00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:50.700
THAT'S MADE IN CALIFORNIA. AND

00:52:50.767 --> 00:52:53.336
OTHER STATES THAT I MENTIONED

00:52:53.403 --> 00:52:55.672
SO THAT IMBALANCE IT HAS TO BE

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:58.708
CORRECTED I THINK WE THAT'S WHY

00:52:58.775 --> 00:53:00.844
I MENTIONED. THE ISSUE IS ARE

00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:02.512
WE NEED TO HAVE A STATE LEVEL

00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:04.381
COORDINATION. OF FOR FREIGHT

00:53:04.447 --> 00:53:07.083
POLICY THAT GIVES INVESTMENT IN

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:09.252
PORTS. THAT'S IMPORTANT NOW

00:53:09.319 --> 00:53:12.522
WHAT I NAME STANDS UP. I JUST

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:13.890
OPENED IT IS AMPLE AND SHOW THE

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:15.091
OTHER BOARD DIRECTORS WAS TO

00:53:15.158 --> 00:53:17.961
SAY THEIR OWN- THAT IS WE ARE

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:19.462
TRYING TO EXACT FOR ELECTRIFY

00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:21.765
PORTS. FIND TO MAKE IT MORE

00:53:21.831 --> 00:53:23.266
EFFICIENT AND WE'RE TRYING TO

00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:25.302
REDUCE THE EMISSIONS ONE OF

00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:27.203
THOSE HAS TO BE INVESTMENT IN

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:28.371
OUR ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE

00:53:28.438 --> 00:53:31.575
JUST SUPPLIED PARTS. AS WELL AS

00:53:31.641 --> 00:53:39.583
WE STATED WE NEED MORE- SPACE.

00:53:39.649 --> 00:53:40.584
AND WE ALSO NEED INVEST IN TURN

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:42.619
OF- INLAND PORT YOU KNOW WORDS

00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:45.322
THAT HAVE. TWO MODELS AVAILABLE

00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:46.623
ENGLAND OF THE SO THEY WE CAN

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:48.825
OUT. AND HAVE TO PRY IT AT THE

00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:51.895
STORE. I DOLLARS BY SHIP BY RAY-

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:53.797
INFRASTRUCTURE. TO MAKE SURE

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:56.399
THAT- WE- WE CAN PROCESS SOME

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:58.101
OF THOSE CARGO INLAND UP ON THE

00:53:58.168 --> 00:54:00.870
PORCH ITSELF SO AGAIN- THIS

00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:02.038
KIND OF RESILIENCE

00:54:02.105 --> 00:54:03.607
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IS

00:54:03.673 --> 00:54:05.942
SOMETHING THAT WE- BADLY. SO

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:07.277
THE GOVERNMENT CAN ACT AS WANT

00:54:07.344 --> 00:54:07.911
TO MAKE SURE I WROTE THIS DOWN

00:54:07.978 --> 00:54:09.212
CORRECTLY SO YOU SAID THERE'S

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:10.680
ELEVEN AND ELEVEN TO ONE AND

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:12.082
BALLOTS SO FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE

00:54:12.148 --> 00:54:13.850
INVEST OTHER STATES INVEST

00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:18.221
ELEVEN DOLLARS- IN THERE FOR

00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:19.656
INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT AND STATE.

00:54:19.723 --> 00:54:22.092
COMBINED NOT JUST EIGHT ZERO

00:54:22.158 --> 00:54:23.059
ZERO ZERO YEAH THE SOAPS OF THE

00:54:23.126 --> 00:54:24.260
TOTAL INVESTMENT SO OTHER

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:26.796
STATES SPEND ELEVEN TIMES MORE

00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:27.263
THAN WE DO ON THE POOR

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:29.466
INFRASTRUCTURE- THAT SAYS

00:54:29.532 --> 00:54:30.667
SOMETHING I THINK WE NEED TO

00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:32.902
ADDRESS. CAN YOU YOU'VE I KNOW

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:33.570
MY THAT MY LAST QUESTION I

00:54:33.637 --> 00:54:34.938
GUESS IS- YOU MENTIONED

00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:36.640
ADDITIONAL COORDINATION-

00:54:36.706 --> 00:54:39.042
MULTIPLE TIMES. WHO WOULD BE

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:40.543
THE ONE COORDINATING WOULD BE

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:42.112
IT WOULD IT WOULD WHO WOULD YOU

00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:43.647
HOW WOULD YOU ENVISION THIS

00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:44.948
COORDINATION RIGHT NOW I THINK

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:45.548
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT

00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:46.916
COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION

00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:48.718
BUT WHEN WE GET TO BRASS TACKS

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:50.020
HOW DOES THIS FUNCTION HOW DOES

00:54:50.086 --> 00:54:51.521
IT WORK WHO WHO DO YOU ENVISION

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:53.523
A WHAT YOU ENVISION. TO BE

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:56.726
COORDINATING. AND THIS IS A-

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:59.162
THIS IS. A QUESTION THESE DAYS.

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:01.231
IS THAT WE ARE DISCOVERING THIS

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:03.166
KIND OF CRISIS. THE WHO IS THE

00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:04.901
COORDINATOR. IS THE BIG

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:06.569
QUESTION- WE TALK ABOUT A

00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:09.706
SUPPLY CHAIN. IT IS A IT IS

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:11.174
EVEN CHANGING IMAGINE THE LINKS

00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:12.375
INTO TALKING SOMETIMES DON'T

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:13.276
CONNECT EACH YEAR THE VERY

00:55:13.343 --> 00:55:15.011
WELL. AND BY WHO IS ACTUALLY

00:55:15.078 --> 00:55:16.713
MAKE SURE THESE THINGS ARE

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:18.448
ACTUALLY CONNECTED TO OTHER. I

00:55:18.515 --> 00:55:19.616
THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT I

00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:20.817
THINK WE NEED TO SOLVE AND

00:55:20.884 --> 00:55:21.584
THAT'S WHY ONE OF OUR

00:55:21.651 --> 00:55:23.653
SUGGESTIONS. IS THAT WE DO NEED

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.555
A STATE. LEADERSHIP WITHIN NEED

00:55:25.622 --> 00:55:27.957
A POINT TO PERSON. OR VIæT

00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:29.626
GROUP THAT WILL FIGURE TO HELP

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:31.227
US FIGURES OUT WHAT IS THE

00:55:31.294 --> 00:55:33.063
COORDINATION SYSTEM. ONE OF THE

00:55:33.129 --> 00:55:34.330
SUGGESTIONS THAT WE HAVE MADE

00:55:34.397 --> 00:55:36.232
IS THAT. NUMBER ONE WE NEED

00:55:36.299 --> 00:55:37.767
MORE TRANSPARENCY IT BEFORE WE

00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:39.769
CAN COORDINATE ANYTHING. WE

00:55:39.836 --> 00:55:41.271
NEED A SYSTEM WHICH THERE'S-

00:55:41.337 --> 00:55:44.007
CLARITY. AS TO IF I AM A CARGO

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:46.009
OWNER. WHERE IS MY COULD

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:48.211
CONTAIN A CARGO. IF I'M UP FOR

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:54.284
THOÁT HOW DO I KNOW WHEN. THE

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:55.985
CAR GOES COMING IN. AND WHEN

00:55:56.052 --> 00:55:57.387
YOU SHIP SUPPORT OUT. AND IS A

00:55:57.454 --> 00:55:58.655
REGULAR SCHEDULE THAT'S ABOUT

00:55:58.722 --> 00:56:01.191
IT ALL THIS SO. OF THE

00:56:01.257 --> 00:56:04.260
INFORMATION IS NUMBER ONE STEP.

00:56:04.327 --> 00:56:06.463
IN TERMS OF I CHIANG BUT NOW

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:08.465
TWO WE DO NEED ACCORDING EFFORT.

00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:09.099
TO ASK YOUR QUESTION. WHO IS

00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:12.769
THE- OF ALL THE SYSTEM. SO I

00:56:12.836 --> 00:56:14.370
WAS ONE LAST QUESTION BASED ON

00:56:14.437 --> 00:56:16.740
THAT EACH. WEEK AS I SAID IN MY

00:56:16.806 --> 00:56:17.974
OPENING STATEMENT AND I THINK

TIMES. THERE HAS TO BE A SENSE

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.882
OF URGENCY- SO WHO'S

UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE SUPPLY

00:56:32.288 --> 00:56:35.058
CHAIN. A LOT OF TIMES. RIGHT

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:37.260

BOATS IN THE CARGO SHIPS OFF

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:41.397
THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA. BUT

00:56:41.464 --> 00:56:42.599
EVEN IF WE REMOVED ALL THE

00:56:42.665 --> 00:56:43.867
CONTAINERS OFF THOSE BOATS

00:56:43.933 --> 00:56:45.001
THERE ARE STILL MULTIPLE

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:46.369
CHECKPOINTS THROUGHOUT THE

COMING UP WITH SOLUTIONS. SOME

00:57:34.517 --> 00:57:35.418
OTHER SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS I

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:38.121
MENTIONED. IN MY TESTIMONY IN

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:39.322
FACT HAS COME OUT OF THAT

00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:41.691
DISCUSSION WITH MR PICARDO SO

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:44.260
THAT IS A FEDERAL EFFORT TO

00:57:44.327 --> 00:57:46.396
COORDINATE THESE THINGS. BUT

00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:47.964
YOU KNOW LONG TERM HOWEVER WE

00:57:48.031 --> 00:57:51.201
DO NEED A SPECIAL IN CALIFORNIA

00:57:51.267 --> 00:57:52.902
IS IN VIEWING OURSELVES AS A

00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:55.538
COMPETITIVE. A PLAYER WITH

00:57:55.605 --> 00:57:57.473
OTHER STATES WE DO NEED BETTER

00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:02.745
COORDINATION AMONG JUST. ONE

00:58:02.812 --> 00:58:03.313
IMPORTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN

00:58:03.379 --> 00:58:04.848
HERE. I THINK MY- THANK YOU

THANK YOU AND JUST JUST BACK TO

00:58:06.482 --> 00:58:07.984
THE POINT ABOUT THE AMOUNTS THE

00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:09.385
ELEVEN TO ONE RATIO. I THINK

00:58:09.452 --> 00:58:10.587
WHAT HE WAS INCLUDING THERE AND

00:58:10.653 --> 00:58:12.121
I CAN HIGHLIGHT AS ONE EXAMPLE

00:58:12.188 --> 00:58:12.922
IS THE HARBOR MAINTENANCE FEE

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:15.358
RIGHT. PORT USERS PANDA THAT

00:58:15.425 --> 00:58:17.126
AND THEN IT'S PUT OUT TO

00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:18.862
IMPROVE PORTS ACROSS THE NATION

00:58:18.928 --> 00:58:21.197
BUT CALIFORNIA DOES NOT AT ALL

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:22.232
GET ITS FAIR SHARE OF THE

00:58:22.298 --> 00:58:23.666
HARBOR MAINTENANCE HE ACTUALLY

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:25.468
GOES. TO IMPROVE SOME MUCH

00:58:25.535 --> 00:58:27.270
SMALLER PORTS TO AND WE DON'T

00:58:27.337 --> 00:58:28.538
GET ENOUGH THERE'S A HUGE

00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:30.106
BALANCER NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:31.040
THAT'S REALLY AT THE FEDERAL

00:58:31.107 --> 00:58:33.676
LEVEL WITH THAT SENATOR EGGMAN

00:58:41.117 --> 00:58:43.253
SO I REPRESENT MYSELF IN THE

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:55.198
SOME OF THE- THE SHIPS THAT ARE

00:58:55.265 --> 00:58:57.233
COMING IN. BUT I GUESS SOME OF

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:59.002
MY QUESTIONS AROUND AND AT THAT

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:00.370
HEY LET ME JUST SAY I THINK I

00:59:00.436 --> 00:59:01.404
CONCUR WITH A LOT OF MY

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:02.772
COLLEAGUES AND I'M A LITTLE BIT

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:04.474
HORRIFIED THAT WE DON'T HAVE.

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:05.808
BETTER SYSTEMS ALREADY IN PLACE

00:59:05.875 --> 00:59:07.610
LIKE YOU KIND OF VISUALIZE IS

00:59:07.677 --> 00:59:08.244
AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER

00:59:08.311 --> 00:59:09.612

THEIR OWN WHICH WHICH I MEAN

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:17.654
AND THEN WE THEN WE UNDERSTAND

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:18.721
WHY WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT

00:59:18.788 --> 00:59:21.925
NOW- BUT MY QUESTION MY POINT

00:59:21.991 --> 00:59:23.493
IS WHILE IT CANNOT MAY PERHAPS

00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:25.194

SOME OF THE SMALLER PORTS LIKE

00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:34.337
HOW ARE WE LOOKING AT THAT AND

00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:36.472
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IN AND

00:59:36.539 --> 00:59:38.041
AROUND THE STOCK IMPORT THAT

00:59:38.107 --> 00:59:39.175
DEBT THAT SHIPPING IS GOING TO

CHANGE RIGHT RIGHT NOW THEY

00:59:41.077 --> 00:59:42.312
HAVE BIG TWENTY TWENTY. THIS

00:59:42.378 --> 00:59:43.813
CONTAINER THAT ARE GOING TO GO

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.448
DOWN TO LIKE TWO THOUSAND WHICH

00:59:45.515 --> 00:59:47.050
WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE YOU KNOW A

00:59:47.116 --> 00:59:48.117
LOT OF THOSE ENOUGH THAT WE'RE

00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:50.219
SEEING HAPPENING ALREADY- AND

00:59:50.286 --> 00:59:51.688
THEN EVERY EVERY SMALLER

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:53.256
CONTAINER WE TAKE INTO STOCKTON

00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:55.758
IS TWO THOUSAND TRUCKS THAT

00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:56.759
WERE TAKEN OFF THE ROAD SO

00:59:56.826 --> 00:59:58.361
WE'RE WE'RE MEETING A LOT OF

00:59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.396
GOALS AT THE SAME TIME. AND WE

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:01.497
KNOW THAT WE I MEAN WE HAVE THE

01:00:01.564 --> 01:00:02.932
SPACE WE HAVE THE CRANES WE

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.534
HAVE THE LABOR WE HAVE THAT

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.469
CAPACITY WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IS

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:09.505
A CUSTOM BORDERS TO BE ABLE TO-

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:11.374
CHECKPOINTS TO BE ABLE TO SCAN

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.009
THE MATERIAL THAT'S COMING IN

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:15.178
WE KNOW IS A BIG PART. SO I

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:16.512
GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW ARE WE

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:17.647
GOING TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.015
SOME OF THE MORE INLAND PORTS

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:20.883
WITH SOME OF THE SMALLER- SHIPS

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:21.818
THAT ARE THAT ARE ALREADY BEING

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:23.686
ON ORDER TO BE CREATED SO WE

01:00:23.753 --> 01:00:25.455
KNOW THAT'S COMING SO IT'S EVEN

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:26.956
MORE IMPORTANT I THINK THAT WE

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:27.790
GET THIS COORDINATION PIECE

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:30.026
DOWN. I WHAT ARE WE DOING THEN

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:31.294
TO INCREASE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

MAKE THAT HAPPEN AT ALL

01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:52.114

ALL TOGETHER. THOSE SHIPS ARE

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:35.704
RETURNING EMPTIES TO ASIA

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:37.839
INSTEAD OF THE PAST PRACTICE OF

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:39.474
HOLDING IRAQ EXPORTS. AS A

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.576
RESULT WE LOST MARKETS-

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:43.011
ESPECIALLY FOR ONE ITS EUROPEAN

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:44.880
CHRISTMAS IS A BIG MARKET IS

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:45.413
NOW BEING FILLED BY OTHER

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.516
COUNTRIES. ONE OF OUR MEMBERS

01:19:47.582 --> 01:19:48.917
LOST OVER SEVEN POINT FIVE

01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:50.185
MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE MONTH OF

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:52.654
SALES. BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:55.023
TO FILL TIME THE COMMITMENTS.

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.024
SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS WE'VE

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:57.159
BEEN LOOKING AT- WHICH ARE

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:58.693
STRUCTURALLY EMERGENCY

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.996
SOLUTIONS- WE ARE SHIPPING

01:20:01.062 --> 01:20:02.631
PISTACHIOS ON RAIL CARS TO

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:04.933
HOUSTON GALVESTON- THAT'S NOT

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:05.734
MAKING MONEY THAT'S AN

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:06.935
ADDITIONAL TWELVE DOLLARS PER

01:20:07.002 --> 01:20:08.770
CONTAINER BUT IT'S SIMPLE TO

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:10.138
KEEP OUR MARKET PLACE. WE'RE

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:11.640
ALSO PLACING LIMITS ON REAL

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:13.808
COURTS TO BALTIMORE. AT A LOSS

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:14.609
JUST TO KEEP OUR EUROPEAN

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:16.845
CUSTOMERS. ON THE CON SIDE

01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:19.047
WE'VE ACTUALLY PHONE. VIA AIR

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:21.249
FREIGHT- BALES OF COTTON TO

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:23.818
PERU AGAIN JUST TO PRESERVE

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:25.587
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. AND THEN

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:26.855
WE'VE AS BEEN STATE ON SOME OF

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:28.089
THE SMALLER PORTS WERE ACTUALLY

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:29.257
SHIPPING SOME CONTAINERS

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:30.892
THROUGH PORT WHY NINI. AGAIN

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:31.826
THIS IS A THAT'S A BANDAID

01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:33.128
SITUATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:20:33.195 --> 01:20:34.196
HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:35.664
REALLY HANDLE LARGE ONE THE

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:37.699
CONTAINERS OR LARGE SHIPS. BUT

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:38.967
IT IS SOME WAY TO TRY TO

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:41.303
SURVIVE THROUGH THIS- IN TERMS

01:20:41.369 --> 01:20:43.371
OF CAUSES. AGAIN IT'S BEEN

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:44.306
STATED MANY TIMES IT'S REALLY

01:20:44.372 --> 01:20:46.508
IT'S AN IMPERFECT AND OVER ONE

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:48.510
SITUATION. ALL RIGHT NOW AND NO

01:20:48.577 --> 01:20:51.246
ONE CAN DISPUTE THERE'S A HUGE

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:52.781
INCREASE IN IMPORTS. COVERT

01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:53.815
DEFINITELY PLAYED A ROLE

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:55.584
THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF TRUCKERS.

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.619
BUT FRANKLY THE OPENING HOURS

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:58.153
THE PORTS DON'T MATCH THE

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:00.055
CURRENT DEMAND- BUT MOST

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:02.324
IMPORTANTLY WE ARE AT THE MERCY

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:04.492
OF FOREIGN SHIPPING COMPANIES.

01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:06.995
WE HAVE NO OVERSIGHT OR TEETH

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:08.597
IN TRYING TO GET THESE- FEES

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:10.599
CORRECTED OR THEM TO TAKE COME

01:21:10.665 --> 01:21:11.233
TO- GOING TO TAKE OUR AG

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:15.270
EXPORTS- WE'RE GAME THAT-

01:21:15.337 --> 01:21:16.438
SOMEBODY CHANGE THE RULES ON US

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:18.273
AND WE HAVE NO WAY TO CORRECT

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:18.974
IT. WE ARE PURELY AT THEIR

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.542
MERCY. OUR CULTURE AND OUR

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:22.277
INABILITY GET OUR EXPORTS OUT

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:24.613
HIS SIMPLY COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:25.280
WE NEED SOLUTIONS WE NEED THEM

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:27.282
YESTERDAY. SOME OF THE

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:28.783
SUGGESTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:30.218
ADDITIONAL STORAGE FOR THE

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:34.055
CONTAINERS- TRUCKING- TRUCKERS

01:21:34.122 --> 01:21:35.857
LONGSHOREMAN THERE'S ALL TAKE

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:37.592
TIME TO PUT IN PLACE. AND

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:38.393
UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE BEEN

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:39.294
DEALING WITH THIS FOR OVER A

01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:40.829
YEAR AND A HALF. SO ANY

01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:43.231
SOLUTION THAT CAN MOVE THIS

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:43.865

GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES AND I

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:12.327
THINK ONE EXAMPLE I CAN USE IS

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:13.962
RECENTLY THIS YEAR THEY PASSED

01:22:14.029 --> 01:22:15.430
THE INDIRECT SOURCE ROLE IN

01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:16.631

WHEN CONSUMERS DEMAND

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:30.145
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY IN

THEIR IN THEIR RETAILERS WE'RE

01:22:31.846 --> 01:22:32.547
GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO MEET

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:35.116
THAT SO WE WANT TO MEET AND WE

01:22:35.183 --> 01:22:37.052
ARE VERY BROAD AND HIGH IN OUR

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.920
MENTAL STATE ABILITY GOALS BUT

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:40.055
WHEN SOME OF THESE REGULATIONS

01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:42.257
ARE PASSED. AND THE TECHNOLOGY

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:44.459
IS NOT THERE THE TECHNOLOGY IS

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:46.461
NOT THERE TO IMPLEMENT WHAT

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:47.729
THEY WANT TO ACCOMPLISH THE

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:49.698
INDIRECT SOURCE FULL THEY'RE

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:52.133
GOOD IN THAT TAXING RETAILERS

ARE THE OPERATORS OF THE

01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:54.936
WAREHOUSES BUT YET THEY CAN'T

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:57.305
DO ANYTHING TO IMPLEMENT THE

01:22:57.372 --> 01:22:59.374
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:00.675
SO I WILL SAY WHEN THAT WILL

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:02.677
PASSED NOW WITH MAY OF THIS

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:05.814
YEAR I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH-

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.115
RETAILERS SOME NATIONAL

01:23:07.182 --> 01:23:08.650
RETAILERS WHO WERE LOOKING AT

01:23:08.717 --> 01:23:09.884
EXPANDING THEIR WAREHOUSE

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:12.354
CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA. AND NOW

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:14.389
THAT THAT'S OFF THE TABLE AND

01:23:14.456 --> 01:23:15.523
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THE

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:18.493
UNCERTAINTY IN CALIFORNIA IT'S

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.995
A CONSTANT YOU KNOW LEGISLATION

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:24.265
PASSING REGULATIONS PASSING AND

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:25.767
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:30.238
I'VE. TALKED ABOUT WITH SOME OF

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:31.106
YOU IS. YOU KNOW ONCE THE- IS

01:23:31.172 --> 01:23:32.841
THAT LET'S TAKE A STEP LOOK AT

01:23:32.907 --> 01:23:34.142
ALL OF THE REGULATIONS THAT

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:35.677
HAVE BEEN PASSED IN PART OF THE

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:38.046
LAST TEN YEARS. THAT IMPACT THE

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:40.281
SUPPLY CHAIN. LET'S MAKE SURE

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:42.183
THEY'RE ACTUALLY WORKING. IF

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:43.351
THEY'RE NOT WORKING LET'S TRY

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:45.720
TO IMPROVE THAT BUT WHEN YOU

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:48.189
HAVE LOCAL. APPOINTED BOARDS

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:50.091
MAKING REGULATIONS THE

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:52.093
LEGISLATURE PASSING BILLS THE

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.294
GOVERNOR DOING EXECUTIVE

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:55.864
ORDERS. IT'S VERY CHALLENGING

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:57.799
TO KEEP THAT. AND WHEN

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:59.501
BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:01.636
RETAILERS SEE THE UNCERTAINTY.

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:03.037
IT'S EASY TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:04.806
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:06.374
WAREHOUSE AND OF THAT ACT. OR

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:08.576
ARIZONA AND WE'RE GONNA TRACK

01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:11.012
THAT ACROSS THE STATE. USE THE

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:12.781
DISTRIBUTION CENTER THERE AND

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:14.916
BRING IT BACK TO CALIFORNIA. SO

01:24:14.983 --> 01:24:16.584
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN NUMBER ONE

01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:17.752
WE'RE NOT MEETING ENVIRONMENTAL

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:19.954
GOALS. NUMBER TWO ALL OF THESE

01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:22.290
JOBS THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THIS

01:24:22.357 --> 01:24:23.525
THIS NOTION THAT THESE

01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:25.627
WAREHOUSE JOBS ARE NOT THE JOBS

01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:27.429
THEY ARE THERE THERE ARE SOME

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:29.431
OTHER ARE STARTING UPWARDS OF

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:31.266
TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS AN HOUR.

01:24:31.332 --> 01:24:32.167
THOSE JOBS WILL BE IN

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:34.235
CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THOSE ARE

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:36.104
IT'S NOT JUST ONE I CAN'T POINT

01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:38.006
TO JUST ONE THING SURE IT YOU

01:24:38.072 --> 01:24:40.875
HAVE TO TAKE IT ALL TOGETHER.

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:41.910
AND WE WOULD WELCOME THE

01:24:41.976 --> 01:24:43.745
OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN WITH

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:45.847
FOLKS AND SAY. LET'S HAVE A

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:47.348
FRANK CONVERSATION WE'RE NOT

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:49.184
SAYING REPEAL EVERYTHING BUT

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:50.552
WE'RE SAYING LET'S TALK ABOUT

01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:52.353
IT AND HAVE A CONVERSATION

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.222
ABOUT. ARE WE HINDERING THE

01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:55.423
SUPPLY CHAIN IN THE GOODS

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:57.358
MOVEMENT BY THESE REGULATIONS

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:58.960
AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO

01:24:59.027 --> 01:25:00.495
STREAMLINE IT TO MAKE IT EASIER

01:25:00.562 --> 01:25:02.497
FOR BUSINESSES IN THE STATE. I

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:04.165
CERTAINLY THINK THAT. THAT WE

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:05.667
NEED A HOLISTIC APPROACH I

01:25:05.733 --> 01:25:06.267
THINK YOU HAVE TO THE CORRECT

01:25:06.334 --> 01:25:09.037
THAT WE NEED TO. RE EVALUATE AS

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:10.672
I SAID EARLIER EVERYTHING THAT

01:25:10.738 --> 01:25:11.973
HAS HAPPENED IN THE OVER MAYBE

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:16.845
WE GO BACK TEN FIFTEEN YEARS-

01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:17.812
TO SEE KIND OF. HOW A THEY

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:20.081
LATER. I THINK WE'VE- A LOT OF

01:25:20.148 --> 01:25:21.716
THINGS RULES AND MANDATES AND

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:23.485
REGULATIONS OVER AN EXECUTIVE

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:24.419
ORDERS OVER AND OVER AND OVER

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:25.954
ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. AND THAT

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.655
I THINK HAS MADE THE PROBLEM

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:28.990
WORSE THAT NOW IT'S TOO

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:31.926
DIFFICULT- IT'S LIKE AN ANCHOR

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:34.028
ON SOMEONE THAT SWIMMING. WE

01:25:34.095 --> 01:25:35.430
SAY UNFORTUNATELY THE SUMMER

01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:36.498
DOESN'T SWIM FAST ENOUGH

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:38.132
ANYMORE BUT INSTEAD OF CUTTING

01:25:38.199 --> 01:25:39.934
OFF THE ANCHORS AND LIVING THE

01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:43.171
SUMMER'S CTUALLY- DO WHAT. I

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:45.173
HEAR SHE IS SUPPOSED TO DO- IN

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.609
TERMS OF M. AND MAYBE THAT'S

01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:48.910
WHERE THE AYE YOU MENTIONED

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:50.345
THIS CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR

01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:52.514
RESPONSIBLE GOODS MOVING. AT

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:54.449
WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO DO AN

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:57.485
ANALYSIS. TO OR HELP US

01:25:57.552 --> 01:26:00.188
DEVELOP- THAT TYPE OF DATA AND

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:01.623
INFORMATION OF WHERE WE KNOW

01:26:01.689 --> 01:26:02.957
WHAT THE WHERE THE LEFT HAND

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:04.125
KNOWS WHAT THE RIGHT HAND IS

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:05.627
DOING. WITH THAT BEING. SAID

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:06.961
THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO BRING

01:26:07.028 --> 01:26:08.129
EVERYONE TOGETHER I THINK ONE

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:09.130
OF THE THINGS YOU'VE HEARD HIS

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:11.466
THAT. IT EVERYONE'S DOING THEIR

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:13.468
OWN THING AND THERE'S NO ONE

01:26:13.535 --> 01:26:14.903
THAT'S REALLY LIKE BRINGING

01:26:14.969 --> 01:26:16.137
EVERYONE TO THE TABLE AND

01:26:16.204 --> 01:26:17.739
HAVING A CONVERSATION SPECIFIC

01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:18.540
TO HOW IT'S IMPACTING

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:20.742
CALIFORNIA. SO ABSOLUTELY I'VE

01:26:20.808 --> 01:26:22.076
HAD FOLKS REACH OUT TO ME AND

01:26:22.143 --> 01:26:23.444
SAY HEY WE CAN PROVIDE WHITE

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:25.046
PAPERS ON THIS ISSUE OR WE CAN

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:26.681
PROVIDE WHITE PAPERS ON THIS ON

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:28.550
THAT ISSUE. I THINK IT'S AN

01:26:28.616 --> 01:26:30.251
INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY AND WE

01:26:30.318 --> 01:26:31.686
WANT TO PARTNER WITH ALL OF YOU

01:26:31.753 --> 01:26:33.187
WE WANT TO ENGAGE WITH ALL THE

01:26:33.254 --> 01:26:34.889
I THINK IT'S A GREAT. WAY TO

01:26:34.956 --> 01:26:37.025
SHOW THE PUBLIC SECTOR THE

01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:38.059
PRIVATE SECTOR COMING TOGETHER

01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:39.627
HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS SO

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:40.828
YEAH ABSOLUTELY THAT'S

01:26:40.895 --> 01:26:42.497
SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD DO.

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:43.731
THIS HAVE TO BE DATA DRIVEN

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:46.634
SURE RIGHT WE CAN'T SAY. AND

01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:48.636
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY TO YOU IS

01:26:48.703 --> 01:26:50.638
AS- LEGISLATORS IN CALIFORNIA

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:52.173
WE NEED TO GET RID OF ACTS

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.208
REGULATION AND LESS I CAN SHOW

01:26:54.275 --> 01:26:56.277
YOU WHY THAT REGULATION IS NOT

01:26:56.344 --> 01:26:58.212
WORKING. AND HOW WE CAN TRY TO

01:26:58.279 --> 01:26:59.681
ACCOMPLISH THOSEGOALS THROUGH

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:00.915
ANOTHER AVENUE. BUT WHAT

01:27:00.982 --> 01:27:03.284
HAPPENS IS A LOT OF TIMES AND

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:04.118
WE'RE NOT INCLUDED IN THOSE

01:27:04.185 --> 01:27:07.088
CONVERSATIONS. AND SO WE'RE NOT

01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:07.989
ABLE TO BRING THAT PERSPECTIVE

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:09.023
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:15.530
DO WITH THIS COALITION- WELL. I

01:27:15.597 --> 01:27:16.264
THINK THAT THE OUT. YOUR

01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:17.632
COLLEAGUES A EXCUSE WE NEED TO.

01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:19.667
YESTERDAY IF YOU COULD PROVIDE

01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:22.637
A TO AND FROM- I. TOMORROW IF

01:27:22.704 --> 01:27:25.473
YOU HAVE IDEAS. IN MY- VIE IF

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.675
YOU OF IDEAS AND I THINK WE DO

01:27:27.742 --> 01:27:28.409
NEED TO TAKE A HOLISTIC

01:27:28.476 --> 01:27:30.178
APPROACH TO LOOK AT WHAT

01:27:30.244 --> 01:27:32.180
OCCURRED OVER- THE DECADE OR

01:27:32.246 --> 01:27:34.315
SO- AND WHAT AT THE SECT WHAT

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:35.683
SACRAMENTO IS DONE AND WHAT

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.418
WHAT WASHINGTON DC HAS DONE TO

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:39.520
IMPACT THE SUPPLY CHAIN- AND IF

01:27:39.587 --> 01:27:40.922
WE CAN BEGIN TO REMOVE THOSE

01:27:40.989 --> 01:27:42.190
ANCHORS OR REMOVE THOSE

01:27:42.256 --> 01:27:43.191
BARRIERS. I THINK WE NEED TO

01:27:43.257 --> 01:27:45.193
LOOK AT THOSE- SOLUTIONS AS

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:46.761
SOON AS POSSIBLE- I HAVE A FEW

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:48.029
QUESTIONS FOR ROGER TO GET TO

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:50.698
SEE YOU- IN TERMS OF YOU

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:52.734
MENTIONED THAT YOUR LAST POINT-

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.070
THAT YOU'RE AT THE MERCY OF- OF

01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:57.739
THE SHIPPING COMPANY'S- IT

01:27:57.805 --> 01:27:59.507
WOULD DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS IN

01:27:59.574 --> 01:28:02.577
TERMS OF. HOW TO CREATE SOME

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:05.146
BALANCE AT IN TERMS OF THAT

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:07.215
RELATIONSHIP. WE DON'T SEE IT-

01:28:07.281 --> 01:28:08.616
THE ONLY WAY THAT THIS CAN BE

01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:10.385
RESOLVED IS IF THAT. IF THE

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:12.687
CONGESTION EASES. AND THOSE

01:28:12.754 --> 01:28:14.455
SHIPPING COMPANIES DON'T AREN'T

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:15.056
MAKING AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:16.324
ARE RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE MAKING

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:18.059
OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:18.660
DOLLARS A CONTAINER FOR THOSE

01:28:18.726 --> 01:28:20.862
IMPORTS SO. DEALING WITH US AND

01:28:20.928 --> 01:28:22.363
EIGHT OR NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:23.297
WHICH IS TWICE WHAT WE USED TO

01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:26.134
PAY FOR- AND EXPORT CONTAINER.

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.168
WORK WE'RE NOT EVEN ON THE

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:29.070
RADAR SCREEN ANYMORE SO. RIGHT

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:30.405
NOW AS LONG AS THAT THAT

01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:32.306
IMPORTANT CRUSHES THERE. THAT'S

01:28:32.373 --> 01:28:34.142
WHERE THE FOCUS IS GOING TO BE.

01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:35.643
AND THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:36.277
LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO

01:28:36.344 --> 01:28:38.312
GET A PRODUCT OUT. IN IN TERMS

01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:40.081

THIS IS THIS IS TRUE- OF

01:28:42.283 --> 01:28:43.885
AGRICULTURE COMPLETELY IN MY

01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:45.520
COLLEAGUE I THINK- AS MENTIONED

IS BEFORE YOU'RE YOU'RE HAVING

01:28:47.255 --> 01:28:48.256
TO YOU'RE FORCED TO MAKE THESE

01:28:48.322 --> 01:28:49.223
DECISIONS TO JUST MAINTAIN

01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:51.526
MARKET CHER- AND MAINTAIN

01:28:51.592 --> 01:28:54.862
MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD- IN.

WELL- DO YOU FEEL THAT THE-

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:03.438
THERE'S NOT AN ALIGNMENT

01:29:03.504 --> 01:29:08.810
BETWEEN. BETWEEN THE PORTS AND-

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:10.478
THE INDISCRETION CENTERS AND-

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:12.246
AND THAT THE SUPPLY CHAIN RIGHT

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:14.415
NOW. WHETHER PEOPLE ARE GONNA

01:29:14.482 --> 01:29:15.216
BE OUT YOU'RE GONNA BE HEARD

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:16.384
FROM THE DAY THEY CAN SPEAK TO

IT BETTER THAN I CAN BUT YES

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:19.153
WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT IT'S EVEN

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.656
A COUPLE MORE HOURS- OPEN FOR

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:22.957
TRUCKS TO COME INSPECTION ONLY

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:24.092
LONG BEACH WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE

01:29:24.158 --> 01:29:26.561
SOME OF IT. IT'S NOT THE ENTIRE

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:27.829
PROBLEM BUT WOULD HELP WOULD

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:29.297
HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THAT

01:29:29.363 --> 01:29:31.399
PRESSURE AND AGAIN HOPEFULLY

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:33.267
THAT'S ENOUGH WHERE I BECAUSE

01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:34.302
THE SHIPS THEY WAITED TOO LONG

01:29:34.368 --> 01:29:37.038

HIS HIS IS A SIGNIFICANT IF NOT

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:52.653

THAT IMPACT IS I GIVE A COUPLE

01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:19.714
EXAMPLES PROBABLY THE BIGGEST

01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:21.115
ONE IS THAT THE LOSS OF SEVEN

01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:22.617
POINT FIVE MILLION ONE MONTH OF

01:30:22.683 --> 01:30:24.652

ESSENTIALLY INFORMATION SYSTEM

01:30:49.076 --> 01:30:49.977
WITH REGARD TO THE PORTS AND I

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:51.212
ONE OF THE- I THINK ONE OF THE

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:52.480
CHALLENGES THE PORT DIRECTORS

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:53.381
HAVE HAD I THINK THEY WOULD

01:30:53.447 --> 01:30:54.715
ARGUE. OR SOME OTHERS THE

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:57.218
PORTER RENO HAD. IS WHAT DOES

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:58.419
THAT MEAN BECAUSE THE

01:30:58.486 --> 01:30:59.554
CHALLENGES THOSE FOLKS ARE

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:01.856
GOING TO FACE IS NOT EVERY BCO

01:31:01.923 --> 01:31:02.790
BENEFICIAL CARGO OWNER

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:04.058
RETAILERS GOING TO WANT TO

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:06.394
SHARE THEIR DATA RIGHT. IF I AM

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:09.063
TARGET I DON'T WANT. WALMART

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:10.932
KNOWING WHEN I'M SHIPPING ENTER

01:31:10.998 --> 01:31:12.233
EVEN THE VOLUME OF WHAT I'M

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.768
SHIPPING AND- HOW DOES THAT

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:15.002
COMPORT WITH IT WITH THE GOAL

01:31:15.069 --> 01:31:16.137
YOU MENTION OF CREATING AN

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:19.240
INFORMATION SYSTEM. YEAH THAT'S

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:20.842
A GREAT QUESTION AND IN

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:22.343
HONESTLY I THINK THOSE ARE PART

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:23.511
OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED

01:31:23.578 --> 01:31:25.046
TO BE HAVE AND I WOULD SAY THIS

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:27.215
IS THAT. IF WE- WANT TO HAVE A

01:31:27.281 --> 01:31:28.716
SUPPLY CHAIN AND A GOODS

01:31:28.783 --> 01:31:30.718
MOVEMENT THAT'S WORKING. AND

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:32.320
THERE MIGHT BE OPPORTUNITIES

01:31:32.386 --> 01:31:33.321
WHERE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:35.056
WAY AROUND I THINK WITH. WITH

01:31:35.122 --> 01:31:36.524
ALL THE TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:38.292
AND THERE'S WAYS TO DO THIS BUT

01:31:38.359 --> 01:31:41.095
YOU CAN MAYBE. GET OUT NOT SURE

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:42.496
THAT PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

01:31:42.563 --> 01:31:44.599
BUT AT LEAST GET THE DATA. YOU

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:46.133
KNOW AVAILABLE SO THAT WE CAN

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.935
GET THE GOODS MOVEMENT. WORKING

01:31:48.002 --> 01:31:49.971
EFFICIENTLY. AND THAT'S WHERE

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:50.605
WE HAVE TO HAVE THOSE

01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:51.939
CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK YOU

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:52.673
HAVE TO HAVE THOSE CRITICAL

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:54.909
CONVERSATIONS AND- YOU KNOW AT

01:31:54.976 --> 01:31:56.010
THIS POINT. I DON'T THINK WE

01:31:56.077 --> 01:31:57.178
EVER WANT TO SEE WHAT WE'RE

01:31:57.245 --> 01:31:58.846
SEEING NOW WHICH IS YOU KNOW

01:31:58.913 --> 01:32:00.248
THE PORTS JUST FULL OF CARGO

01:32:00.314 --> 01:32:01.582
SHIPS BECAUSE THAT HELPS NO

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:03.184
ONE. WHEN ALL OF YOUR CARGO IS

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:04.518
SITTING OUT IN THE PORT WE NEED

01:32:04.585 --> 01:32:05.586
TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:07.421
AND THEN. AND I THINK IN A IN A

01:32:07.488 --> 01:32:09.323
STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA. HOME TO

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:11.158
THE SILICON VALLEY THERE MUST

01:32:11.225 --> 01:32:11.726
BE WAYS THAT WE CAN FIND A

01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:13.961
SOLUTION TO THAT. AND I'M HAPPY

01:32:14.028 --> 01:32:15.563
TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

01:32:15.630 --> 01:32:16.430
TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO FROM THE

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:18.466
RETAIL SIDE. TO TRY TO BE PART

01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:19.901
OF THAT SOLUTION. GREAT THANK

01:32:19.967 --> 01:32:21.469
YOU WILL TALK ABOUT EXPORTS.

01:32:21.535 --> 01:32:22.637
FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE STATE

01:32:22.703 --> 01:32:24.839
LEGISLATURE. HAS EXPORT A LOT

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:27.341
OF ITS AUTHORITY. TO BOARDS AND

01:32:27.408 --> 01:32:28.342
COMMISSIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF

01:32:28.409 --> 01:32:31.145
CALIFORNIA. SUCH THAT- WE ARE

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:32.480
RESPONSIBLE TO THEM AND THEY

01:32:32.546 --> 01:32:34.515
ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR US. AND

01:32:34.582 --> 01:32:36.651
THAT CREATES A VERY FRUSTRATING

01:32:36.717 --> 01:32:41.856
DYNAMIC AND HIGH AT TIMES. MANY

01:32:41.923 --> 01:32:42.423
THINGS HAVE YOU KNOW WITH. A

01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:42.990
LOT THE CHANGES GOOD. HAVE

01:32:43.057 --> 01:32:43.891
BECAUSE THE BOARDS ARE. BUT THE

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:45.059
SAME AS A LARGE. OFTEN I'VE

01:32:45.126 --> 01:32:46.327
FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I CAN'T

01:32:48.429 --> 01:32:49.764
THEY'RE MAKING. WITH REGARD TO

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:50.998
MATTERS OF MY DISTRICT. THAT

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:52.266
MIGHT. NEED TO BE MADE BUT

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:54.702
MAYBE MADE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT-

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:55.870
AND I WAS IT WAS GONNA GO GREEN

01:32:55.937 --> 01:32:57.071
WE GOTTA MAKE GREAT WILL GO

01:32:57.138 --> 01:32:59.173
GREAT- AND THEN THAT CAN BE

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.675
VERY FRUSTRATING. SO I SHARE

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:04.946

01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:51.918
SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THE

01:50:12.238 --> 01:50:14.140
SERIES OF ONE OFF PROJECTS WITH

01:50:14.207 --> 01:50:16.142
VERY LITTLE CONSIDERATION GIVEN

01:50:16.209 --> 01:50:17.877

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:23.249
THAT WILL CHANGE THE

01:50:23.316 --> 01:50:26.152
DISAGREEMENT. ON TOP OF THAT

01:50:26.219 --> 01:50:27.620
THE AGREEMENT WILL SUDDEN SET

01:50:27.687 --> 01:50:28.421

HARBOR MAINTENANCE TRUST FUNDS

02:04:58.490 --> 02:04:59.658

THERE'S A HOLISTIC APPROACH IS

02:05:39.765 --> 02:05:41.634
THE ADMINISTRATION LOOKING AT.

02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:43.736
ALL THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

02:05:43.802 --> 02:05:44.904
AND WHAT'S BURDENING THE SUPPLY

02:05:44.970 --> 02:05:46.906
CHAIN AND- WILLING TO REMOVE

02:05:46.972 --> 02:05:50.976
SOME OF THOSE- ANCHORS. YES I

02:05:51.043 --> 02:05:52.444
THINK WE'RE WILLING TO LOOK AT-

02:05:52.511 --> 02:05:54.280
AT AT A HOLISTIC APPROACH IT AS

02:05:54.346 --> 02:05:56.181
HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AND TO FIND

02:05:56.248 --> 02:05:57.917
WAYS TO TRY TO MOVE THINGS

02:05:57.983 --> 02:05:59.685
FORWARD I THINK. THAT THIS IS A

02:05:59.752 --> 02:06:01.353
VERY COMPLICATED PROCESS OF

02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:02.288
GREAT COMPLICATED SET OF

02:06:02.354 --> 02:06:04.223
PROBLEMS- AND I CERTAINLY DON'T

02:06:04.290 --> 02:06:05.991
THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE WILLING

02:06:06.058 --> 02:06:08.427
TO JUST WHOLESALE. INDEFINITELY

02:06:08.494 --> 02:06:10.329
LIFT CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS

02:06:10.396 --> 02:06:11.096
BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE TO DO

02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:12.731
THIS IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE

02:06:12.798 --> 02:06:13.966
ENVIRONMENT PROTECT WORKERS

02:06:14.033 --> 02:06:15.134
PROTECTS THE COMMUNITIES IN

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:16.635
THOSE. QUARTERS OF COMMERCE

02:06:16.702 --> 02:06:18.470
THAT WE AS WE HEARD FROM SOME

02:06:18.537 --> 02:06:19.672
OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR EVEN BEEN

02:06:19.738 --> 02:06:20.706
REALLY IMPACTED BUT I THINK

02:06:20.773 --> 02:06:22.474
WE'VE ALREADY SHOWN. THAT WE'RE

02:06:22.541 --> 02:06:24.510
WILLING TO LOOK AT- LIFTING

02:06:24.576 --> 02:06:26.045
REGULATIONS YOU KNOW WHAT

02:06:26.111 --> 02:06:27.813
WEIGHT LIMITS ON TRUCKS OFFER

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:29.815
CRITICAL SUPPLIES FINDING NEW

02:06:29.882 --> 02:06:31.417
ROUTES TWENTY OTHER THINGS

02:06:31.483 --> 02:06:33.118
WE'VE DONE IS- IN IN IN IN

02:06:33.185 --> 02:06:36.121
YOUR- GROUP BUT DAVID IS- HELP

02:06:36.188 --> 02:06:38.457
TO EXPEDITE. LICENSES FOR

02:06:38.524 --> 02:06:40.159
PROPER THROUGH DMV ALL RIGHT SO

02:06:40.225 --> 02:06:41.360
WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS WHERE WE

02:06:41.427 --> 02:06:43.295
CAN YOU KNOW ACCOMMODATE

02:06:43.362 --> 02:06:45.864
CHANGES- TO FACILITATE THE

02:06:45.931 --> 02:06:47.199
PROBLEM BUT NOT TO MAKE

02:06:47.266 --> 02:06:49.368
WHOLESALE THROWING OUT. OF SOME

02:06:49.435 --> 02:06:50.536
OF THE IMPORT PROTECTION AND

02:06:50.602 --> 02:06:51.870
I'M AND I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR

02:06:51.937 --> 02:06:52.938
THROWING THINGS OUT I THINK

02:06:53.005 --> 02:06:54.540
OVER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS

02:06:54.606 --> 02:06:55.774
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

02:06:55.841 --> 02:06:57.076
LEFT AND THE RIGHT HAND RIGHT

02:06:57.142 --> 02:06:58.444
NOW NOT COMMUNICATING. AND SO

02:06:58.510 --> 02:06:59.712
IF YOU LOOK AT IT WE WILL TAKE

02:06:59.778 --> 02:07:01.246
ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS TO TRY

02:07:01.313 --> 02:07:02.448
TO UNDERSTAND OUR OUR THEIR

02:07:02.514 --> 02:07:04.083
ACCOMMODATIONS WE CAN MAKE TO

02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.817
ATTEMPT TO MAKE PROGRESS

02:07:04.883 --> 02:07:06.485
ENSURING SLOWER AND SAID THERE

02:07:06.552 --> 02:07:07.853
IS A CONCERN AND IN

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:08.520
APPRECIATION WITH AN

02:07:08.587 --> 02:07:10.356
ADMINISTRATION THAT. YOU HAVE

02:07:10.422 --> 02:07:11.657
TO LOOK NOT ONLY.

02:07:11.724 --> 02:07:13.092
RETROSPECTIVELY BUT

02:07:13.158 --> 02:07:14.026
PROSPECTIVELY BECAUSE I THINK

02:07:14.093 --> 02:07:16.395
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS- WITH

02:07:16.462 --> 02:07:17.096
THAT AFFECT THE SUPPLY CHAIN

02:07:17.162 --> 02:07:19.064

REPAIR REGULATIONS OR OR

02:07:20.766 --> 02:07:22.634
ORDINANCES THAT IMPACT. THE

02:07:22.701 --> 02:07:25.371
PORTS RAIL TRUCKING

MANUFACTURING WAREHOUSES- THAT

02:07:28.841 --> 02:07:30.009
ARE NOT HAVING GONE INTO EFFECT

02:07:30.075 --> 02:07:31.744
YET. THAT TO COULD GO INTO

02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:33.379
EFFECT IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO

02:07:33.445 --> 02:07:35.447
THAT ACTUALLY COULD. EXACERBATE

02:07:35.514 --> 02:07:36.181
THE PROBLEM THAT WE ALREADY

02:07:36.248 --> 02:07:38.283
HAVE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:39.551

INCLUDING TRANSITIONING TO A-

02:07:59.705 --> 02:08:01.340
TO A CLEANER COST SUPPLY CHAIN

02:08:01.407 --> 02:08:03.008
BUT YES I THINK THE- SHORT

02:08:03.075 --> 02:08:04.610

TRY TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE TO

02:08:08.814 --> 02:08:11.450
BUILD AGAIN A RESILIENT- SUPPLY

02:08:11.517 --> 02:08:13.018
CHAIN. WE'RE NOT GOING BACK TO

02:08:13.085 --> 02:08:14.319
WHAT IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO LET

02:08:14.386 --> 02:08:15.320
ALONE TEN YEARS AGO WE'RE GOING

02:08:15.387 --> 02:08:16.622
FORWARD AND HOW TO MEASURE.

02:08:16.688 --> 02:08:18.457
CALIFORNIA TO STICK TO SUCCEED

02:08:18.524 --> 02:08:20.059
AND THRIVE. IN THAT ENVIRONMENT

02:08:20.125 --> 02:08:20.926
HOW DO WE WORK WITH ALL THE

02:08:20.993 --> 02:08:23.028
PARTNERS REQUIRED TO DO THAT-

02:08:23.095 --> 02:08:23.929
STRESSING THAT WE ARE

02:08:23.996 --> 02:08:25.364
RECOGNIZED UNDERSTAND ALL THE

02:08:25.431 --> 02:08:27.066
CHALLENGES WHICH AGAIN IS. IS

02:08:27.132 --> 02:08:28.700
MIND BOGGLINGLY COMPLICATED

02:08:28.767 --> 02:08:30.102
SURE WHAT LET ME JUST ASK

02:08:30.169 --> 02:08:31.537
DIRECTLY THEN I MEAN IS THE

02:08:31.603 --> 02:08:32.671
ADMINISTRATION WILLING TO LOOK

02:08:32.738 --> 02:08:34.940
AT. THE WAREHOUSE ORDINANCES-

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:37.309
THE IMPACTS FROM FEES BOARDS

02:08:37.376 --> 02:08:38.911
THAT THE CHAIR IS MENTIONED.

02:08:38.977 --> 02:08:40.579
ARE THEY WILLING TO LOOK AT-

02:08:40.646 --> 02:08:41.713
YOU KNOW THINGS ON TRUCKING

02:08:41.780 --> 02:08:42.881
THAT GABY FIVE INDEPENDENT

02:08:42.948 --> 02:08:44.116
CONTRACTING OR THE IT'S A

02:08:44.183 --> 02:08:45.317
DEMONSTRATION WILLING TO LOOK

02:08:45.384 --> 02:08:47.653
AT THOSE- THOSE LAWS

02:08:47.719 --> 02:08:49.421
REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES.

02:08:49.488 --> 02:08:51.557
IT'S IN GIVE IT A FRESH LOOK. I

02:08:51.623 --> 02:08:52.458
THINK WE'RE WILLING TO LOOK

02:08:52.524 --> 02:08:53.892
BROADLY I THINK THERE'S SOME

02:08:53.959 --> 02:08:54.893
THINGS THAT WE WON'T BE WILLING

02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:57.429
TO- TO CHANGE BUT I THINK WE

02:08:57.496 --> 02:08:58.897
ARE JUST IN GENERAL WILLING TO

02:08:58.964 --> 02:09:00.699
LOOK BROADLY INCLUDING

02:09:00.766 --> 02:09:01.800
DIALOGUE. WITH ALL OF YOU WHO

02:09:01.867 --> 02:09:03.869
HAD. YOU KNOW A ROLE IN

02:09:03.936 --> 02:09:05.270
IMPLEMENTING A LOT OF THE OF

02:09:05.337 --> 02:09:06.505
THE OF THE REGULATIONS AND THE

02:09:06.572 --> 02:09:07.539
BOARDS THAT THEY WERE TALKING

02:09:07.606 --> 02:09:09.408
ABOUT SO I THINK A- YOU KNOW AN

02:09:09.475 --> 02:09:11.410
ONGOING CONVERSATION BUT- SO

02:09:11.477 --> 02:09:12.277
THERE I THINK THERE WILL BE

02:09:12.344 --> 02:09:12.811
SOME THINGS THAT WILL BE

02:09:12.878 --> 02:09:14.279
WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT AND

02:09:14.346 --> 02:09:18.117
OTHER. THINGS MAKE MAY BE LESS

02:09:18.183 --> 02:09:19.017
SO. WHAT HOPE THAT YOU WILL. I

02:09:19.084 --> 02:09:19.618
MEAN HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET THIS

02:09:19.685 --> 02:09:21.019
FROM. AND INFORMATION FROM FROM

02:09:21.086 --> 02:09:22.588
FROM THIS- FROM SAID THAT

02:09:22.654 --> 02:09:24.389
COALITION OF FROM THE REALTOR

02:09:24.456 --> 02:09:25.891
TO RETAILERS ON SUPPLY CHAIN.

02:09:25.958 --> 02:09:26.825
OF THE CATHOLIC COLLECTION

02:09:26.892 --> 02:09:27.860
RESPONSIBLE GOODS MOVEMENT

02:09:27.926 --> 02:09:29.261
MAYBE THAT WILL SPUR SOME

02:09:29.328 --> 02:09:30.762
CONVERSATION I DO THINK THAT WE

02:09:30.829 --> 02:09:32.431
NEED TO. HAVE A HEART TO HEART.

02:09:32.498 --> 02:09:34.633
ABOUT THAT WHAT. WHAT

02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:35.501
CALIFORNIA IS DOING TO THE

02:09:35.567 --> 02:09:37.603
SUPPLY CHAIN IN OF ITSELF- NOT

02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:39.071
ONLY CURENTLY BUT- FIRST-

02:09:39.138 --> 02:09:40.973
RETROSPECTIVELY AND THEN OF

02:09:41.039 --> 02:09:41.473
COURSE WITH THE FEDERAL

02:09:41.540 --> 02:09:42.774
GOVERNMENT HAS DONE AS WELL-

02:09:42.841 --> 02:09:44.276
AND I WILL ALSO MENTIONED AS-

02:09:44.343 --> 02:09:45.410
MORE OF A STATEMENT THAN

02:09:45.477 --> 02:09:46.812
ANYTHING ELSE BUT- I DO THINK

02:09:46.879 --> 02:09:49.214
THAT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN- BUT

02:09:49.281 --> 02:09:50.682
HAVING THE PORTS GOES WAY FOR

02:09:50.749 --> 02:09:52.618
SEVEN IS. AN IMPORTANT. BUT IT

02:09:52.684 --> 02:09:53.519
HAS TO ALIGN WITH THE

02:09:53.585 --> 02:09:54.353
WAREHOUSES OF THE- THE

02:09:54.419 --> 02:09:58.490
WAREHOUSES ARE NOT. TWENTY FOUR

02:09:58.557 --> 02:09:59.091
SEVEN OR IF THE HOURS ARE NOT

02:09:59.158 --> 02:09:59.658
ALIGNED. A TRUCKER TO PICK

02:09:59.725 --> 02:10:00.826
SOMETHING UP AT NINE PM BUT IF

02:10:00.893 --> 02:10:01.960
THE- IF THE WAREHOUSE IS AN

02:10:02.027 --> 02:10:03.829
OPEN AT NINE PM. THAT'S A

02:10:03.896 --> 02:10:06.798
PROBLEM TOO RIGHT- OF THE

02:10:06.865 --> 02:10:08.300
SECTOR JIM WE SPENT SOMETIME

02:10:08.367 --> 02:10:10.502
TOGETHER TALK ABOUT THIS- YOU

02:10:10.569 --> 02:10:12.271
MENTIONED ABOUT THE HEAT THERE

02:10:12.337 --> 02:10:14.506
WAS A DECISIONS CAN BE MADE ON

02:10:14.573 --> 02:10:16.675
INCREASING THE WEIGHT LIMITS-

02:10:16.742 --> 02:10:17.709
TEMPORARILY WHICH I THINK IS

02:10:17.776 --> 02:10:20.512
IMPORTANT AS WELL. DO YOU HAVE

02:10:20.579 --> 02:10:21.013
A TIME LINE OF WHEN THAT

02:10:21.079 --> 02:10:21.947
DECISION WILL TAKE PLACE.

02:10:22.014 --> 02:10:22.948
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG IT'S GOOD

02:10:23.015 --> 02:10:24.082
TO SEE YOU AGAIN I THINK WE SAW

02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:25.384
EACH OTHER ON THE DAY YOU GOT

02:10:25.450 --> 02:10:26.618
EGO WATER CAME OUT ON TOP

02:10:26.685 --> 02:10:28.320
RIGHT. SO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER

02:10:28.387 --> 02:10:31.190
CALLS ON CALTRANS TO IDENTIFY.

02:10:31.256 --> 02:10:32.691
AND PRIORITIZE POTENTIAL FREE

02:10:32.758 --> 02:10:35.160
ROUTES THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED

02:10:35.227 --> 02:10:36.528
FOR HEIGHT WEIGHT LIMITS. I

02:10:36.595 --> 02:10:37.663
THOUGHT THAT'S A THIRTY DAY

02:10:37.729 --> 02:10:39.331
EXERCISE SO WE HAVE UNTIL I

HIGHER WEIGHT LIMIT. I WOULD I

02:10:59.651 --> 02:11:00.786

WE ALL THERE'S ALWAYS YOU KNOW-

02:13:51.456 --> 02:13:52.557
TEMPTING TO TRY TO GET RID OF

02:13:52.624 --> 02:13:54.126
ALL REGULATIONS AND LAWS DURING

02:13:54.192 --> 02:13:56.294
TIMES OF CRISIS- WE UNDERSTAND

02:13:56.361 --> 02:13:57.329
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION JUST

02:13:57.396 --> 02:13:58.397
NOT GONNA WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND DO

02:13:58.463 --> 02:14:00.232
THE WORK THAT THE LOT OF US-

02:14:00.298 --> 02:14:01.666

SOME ACCOMMODATIONS DURING

COLLAPSING WITH THE EXTRA

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:14.780
WEIGHT SO CASE BY CASE I THINK

02:14:14.846 --> 02:14:15.881
IS VERY IMPORTANT. I THINK I

02:14:15.947 --> 02:14:17.749
JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE

02:14:17.816 --> 02:14:19.484
POINT MAYBE TO MS MYERS I THINK

02:14:19.551 --> 02:14:21.286
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LOOKING UP.

02:14:21.353 --> 02:14:22.921
AND GOING FORWARD

02:14:22.988 --> 02:14:25.090
PROSPECTIVELY- THAT WE DON'T

JUST KIND OF KEEP RECREATING

02:14:26.992 --> 02:14:28.627

SOME OF THE SMALLER INLAND

02:14:35.033 --> 02:14:36.568
PORTS THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE SOME

02:14:36.635 --> 02:14:38.503
OF THE SMALLER CONTAINERS THERE

02:14:38.570 --> 02:14:39.771
ARE WERE ALREADY MOVING IN THAT

02:14:39.838 --> 02:14:41.406
DIRECTION SO HOW DO WE- HOW DO

02:14:41.473 --> 02:14:43.408
WE WORK TO EXPEDITE. SOME OF

02:14:43.475 --> 02:14:44.242
THOSE THINGS BECAUSE THEN WE

02:14:44.309 --> 02:14:45.544

02:14:45.610 --> 02:14:46.945
EXPORT ESPECIALLY AS IT AS IT

02:14:47.012 --> 02:14:49.080
RELATES TO WIND TO ADD PRODUCTS

TO TIMBERED A LOT OF THINGS

02:14:50.182 --> 02:14:51.683
THAT ARE COMING DOWN. FROM THE

02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:53.618

02:14:59.558 --> 02:15:01.493
LOOK AT HOW ON DOING THINGS IN

02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:02.828
WAYS WE HAVEN'T TRADITIONALLY

02:15:02.894 --> 02:15:05.030

02:16:53.171 --> 02:16:54.806
QUESTION I HAVE IS IT SEEMS

02:16:54.873 --> 02:16:56.775
LIKE WE HAVE EAST COAST PORTS

02:16:56.841 --> 02:16:57.676
WEST COAST PORTS IS THERE ANY

02:16:57.742 --> 02:17:00.545
SIMILARITY I KNOW THAT- ON THE

02:17:00.612 --> 02:17:01.646
EAST COAST TO CONSIDER

02:17:01.713 --> 02:17:03.181
OPERATING COSTS AND THE

02:17:03.248 --> 02:17:06.318
CALIFORNIA THEY'RE CALLED LIMB

02:17:06.384 --> 02:17:07.719
MORE PORTS- ARE THERE ANY

02:17:07.786 --> 02:17:10.021
SIMILARITIES. DIFFERENCES OR

02:17:10.088 --> 02:17:11.723
LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE CAN

02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:14.392
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF- BECAUSE

02:17:14.459 --> 02:17:16.861
PEOPLE- WORD ON THE STREET IS

02:17:16.928 --> 02:17:18.930
THEY FEEL LIKE THE CONGESTION

02:17:18.997 --> 02:17:20.298
ISSUES WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA IS

02:17:20.365 --> 02:17:21.833
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME

02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:23.602
OF THE ASPECTS FROM ON THE

02:17:23.668 --> 02:17:25.870
OPERATING CORDS- INSURE THE

02:17:25.937 --> 02:17:27.539
CALIFORNIA STATE CALIFORNIA

02:17:27.606 --> 02:17:30.642
INTERVENE- TO HELP- MOVE THINGS

02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:32.177
ALONG WORKING TOGETHER WITH

02:17:32.243 --> 02:17:33.812
OTHER PARTS I AM AND I'D HATE

02:17:33.878 --> 02:17:35.513
TO LOSE IN THE MARKET SHARE.

02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:38.250
RT'S COAST PORTS AND SO DO YOU

02:17:38.316 --> 02:17:42.621
HAVE ANY- INSIGHT ON THAT.

02:17:42.687 --> 02:17:43.221
ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANKS FOR THE

02:17:43.288 --> 02:17:44.623
QUESTION WHAT'S REALLY

02:17:44.689 --> 02:17:45.223
INTERESTING AND NOT

02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:47.525
SURPRISINGLY. EVERY STATE HAS

02:17:47.592 --> 02:17:49.194
HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE GOVERNING

02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:51.162
STRUCTURE SO FOR EXAMPLE. IN

02:17:51.229 --> 02:17:52.897
VIRGINIA WHERE I USED TO LIVE.

02:17:52.964 --> 02:17:54.833
IN OTHER STATES LIKE FLORIDA.

02:17:54.899 --> 02:17:56.134
IT'S THE STATE THAT OWNS AND

02:17:56.201 --> 02:17:58.603
OPERATES- THE REPORTS IN THEIR

02:17:58.670 --> 02:18:00.438
IN THEIR IN THEIR STATE. THOSE

02:18:00.505 --> 02:18:02.273
ARE STATE ENTITIES THAT IS NOT

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:03.541
THE CASE HERE ARE NOT

02:18:03.608 --> 02:18:04.342
SUGGESTING WE GO THAT

02:18:04.409 --> 02:18:06.745
DIRECTION. BUT IT JUST POINTS

02:18:06.811 --> 02:18:07.779
IT HIGHLIGHTS THE DIFFERENCES

02:18:07.846 --> 02:18:10.515
IN THE WAY PORTS ARE MANAGED.

02:18:10.582 --> 02:18:13.184
OWNED AND OPERATED- AND SO

02:18:13.251 --> 02:18:14.019
THAT'S JUST ONE INTERESTING

02:18:14.085 --> 02:18:16.688
DATA POINT- AND GETTING BACK TO

02:18:16.755 --> 02:18:18.657
A PREVIOUS CONVERSATION- INLAND

02:18:18.723 --> 02:18:21.226
PORT. WE DON'T HAVE AN INLAND

02:18:21.292 --> 02:18:24.229
PORT. WE NEED ONE. AND SO-

02:18:24.295 --> 02:18:25.430
THERE IS A CALIFORNIA INLAND

02:18:25.497 --> 02:18:27.899
PORT PROPOSAL BEING DEVELOPED

02:18:27.966 --> 02:18:28.733

GOVERNMENTS- WE HELP THEM GET A

02:18:31.503 --> 02:18:33.405
ONE MILLION DOLLARS- GRANT FROM

02:18:33.471 --> 02:18:34.072
THE US DEPARTMENT

02:18:34.139 --> 02:18:36.408

02:18:38.610 --> 02:18:40.512
THIS HOLD GREAT PROMISE AND- IN

02:18:40.578 --> 02:18:42.213
FACT THERE PROPOSAL. WAS

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:43.481
SUPPORTED BY THE SAN PEDRO BAY

02:18:43.548 --> 02:18:45.316
PORTS BECAUSE AN INLAND PORT.

02:18:45.383 --> 02:18:47.352
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WOULD DO.

02:18:47.419 --> 02:18:49.154
WONDERS IN TERMS OF RELIEVING

02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:51.289
CHOKEPOINTS. AND FACILITATING

02:18:51.356 --> 02:18:52.590
THE MOVEMENT OF CARGO FROM THE

02:18:52.657 --> 02:18:54.159
SENATE PETER BAY PORTS UP TO

02:18:54.225 --> 02:18:55.827

UNDERSTAND WHAT INLAND PORTS

02:19:01.499 --> 02:19:03.601
MEANS BUT I THINK MAYBE PEOPLE

02:19:03.668 --> 02:19:04.335
WATCHING. HAVE A WHOLE

02:19:04.402 --> 02:19:06.137

INLAND FOR DOING SO STILL IS A

02:19:17.816 --> 02:19:20.251
GREAT EXAMPLE WE DON'T HAVE. IS

02:19:20.318 --> 02:19:23.455
AN INLAND PORT THAT SERVES. AS

02:19:23.521 --> 02:19:25.690
A DESTINATION FOR CARGO COMING

02:19:25.757 --> 02:19:27.892

02:19:27.959 --> 02:19:30.228
BEACH AND OTHER PORTS- THROUGH

02:19:30.295 --> 02:19:32.530
THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BY TRUCK OR

02:19:32.597 --> 02:19:37.001
RAIL- THAT CAN THEN BE SENT- TO

02:19:37.068 --> 02:19:38.136
DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. WE DON'T

02:19:38.203 --> 02:19:40.038
HAVE THAT MANY STATES HAVE AN

02:19:40.105 --> 02:19:42.540

THE TABLE TO DO TO DO THAT. IN

02:19:48.113 --> 02:19:49.247
THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE ARE

02:19:49.314 --> 02:19:51.583
ALSO PROPOSALS TO DO THAT IN

02:19:51.649 --> 02:19:53.485
THE INLAND EMPIRE. SO ADDING

EMPTY RIGHT NOW I AND IS AN

02:20:58.550 --> 02:21:00.418
UNUSED ASSET- TO THE EXTENT

02:21:00.485 --> 02:21:01.586
THAT IT SHOULD BE SO REALLY

02:21:01.653 --> 02:21:03.288

THE ASSETS THAT E HAVE IN

02:21:09.828 --> 02:21:11.095

02:21:15.533 --> 02:21:17.669
WHY WE ARE. STRUGGLING IN THIS

02:21:17.735 --> 02:21:18.970
MOMENT RIGHT NOW S BECAUSE OF

02:21:19.037 --> 02:21:20.738
THE DEREGULATION OF THE

02:21:20.805 --> 02:21:21.306
TRUCKING INDUSTRY THAT HAS

02:21:21.372 --> 02:21:24.008
HAPPENED- AND THE MISCLASSIFIED

MISS CLASSIFICATION OF OUR

02:21:26.077 --> 02:21:27.445
TRUCKERS AS INDEPENDENT

02:21:27.512 --> 02:21:29.047
CONTRACTORS IN CAUSING ONE OF

02:21:29.113 --> 02:21:30.982
THE REASONS WHY. WE DON'T HAVE

02:21:31.049 --> 02:21:32.150
THAT KIND OF WORKFORCE THAT WE

02:21:32.217 --> 02:21:37.455
NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS.

02:21:37.522 --> 02:21:38.556
THIS CRITICAL MOMENT. THANK YOU

WITH THAT- FIRST SENATOR DAHLE.

02:21:45.964 --> 02:21:49.868
THE USE CHAIR NOT SO. I THINK

02:21:49.934 --> 02:21:50.668
IF THERE I HAVE A QUESTION A

02:21:50.735 --> 02:21:53.271
QUESTION WOULD BE- IF THERE WAS

02:21:53.338 --> 02:21:54.639
ONE THING THAT YOU IT WOULD

02:21:54.706 --> 02:21:57.041
MAKE THE SUPPLY CHAIN. SPEED UP

02:21:57.108 --> 02:21:59.544
IN AND OPERATE MORE WHAT WHAT

02:21:59.611 --> 02:22:00.144
DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA WHAT THAT

02:22:00.211 --> 02:22:02.113
ONE THING WOULD BE. I THINK

02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:03.214
MOST OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT

02:22:03.281 --> 02:22:04.682
WE'VE HEARD FROM AGREED THAT

02:22:04.749 --> 02:22:06.618
IT'S GETTING. CONTAINERS OFF

02:22:06.684 --> 02:22:08.353
THE PORT SCRIPT FINDING EXCESS

02:22:08.419 --> 02:22:09.787
SPACE EITHER IN THE PORT

02:22:09.854 --> 02:22:11.322
COMPLEXES ARE OUTSIDE THE COURT

02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:13.358
COMPLEXES. WHERE YOU COULD

02:22:13.424 --> 02:22:15.760
TEMPORARILY STORE FOR

02:22:15.827 --> 02:22:18.363
TRANSPLANTS FOR CONTAINERS SO

02:22:18.429 --> 02:22:20.365
THAT SHE COULD. CREATE MORE

02:22:20.431 --> 02:22:21.432
VELOCITY IN THE SYSTEM AT THE

02:22:21.499 --> 02:22:23.201
PORTS. I THINK THAT THAT THAT

02:22:23.268 --> 02:22:24.869
MEASURE MAJORITY STAKEHOLDER

02:22:24.936 --> 02:22:26.604
POINT IN THAT DIRECTION. SO

02:22:26.671 --> 02:22:28.006
WE'VE WE'VE HEARD A LOT THANK

02:22:28.072 --> 02:22:29.574
YOU. WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT

02:22:29.641 --> 02:22:31.576
THAT FACT THAT. YOU KNOW SOME

02:22:31.643 --> 02:22:33.311
REGULATION AND SO I HAPPEN TO

02:22:33.378 --> 02:22:34.379
BE IN THE TRUCKING BUSINESS

02:22:34.445 --> 02:22:36.881
MYSELF. AND TO THEIR WORST A

02:22:36.948 --> 02:22:38.850
TRUCKING SHORTAGE OF THE PEOPLE

02:22:38.917 --> 02:22:40.151
I SAY I THINK OUR BIGGEST

02:22:40.218 --> 02:22:41.586
INVESTMENT NEED TO BE IN PEOPLE

02:22:41.653 --> 02:22:42.520
AND UNDERSTANDING HOW WE GET

02:22:42.587 --> 02:22:44.389
THOSE PEOPLE. INTO THE JOBS

02:22:44.455 --> 02:22:46.190
THAT ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE AND

02:22:46.257 --> 02:22:47.926
SO FOR THOSE OF US IN THE

02:22:47.992 --> 02:22:50.061
TRUCKING BUSINESS THIS BEFORE-

02:22:50.128 --> 02:22:52.597
COBIT IN. AND THERE'S BEEN A

02:22:52.664 --> 02:22:54.299
LOT OF CHANGES IN THE TRUCKING.

02:22:54.365 --> 02:22:56.067
WORLD AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST

02:22:56.134 --> 02:22:57.936
PROBLEMS IS A LACK OF TALENT TO

02:22:58.002 --> 02:22:59.604
BE ABLE TO PUT PEOPLE IN AND

02:22:59.671 --> 02:23:02.440
ACTUALLY OPERATE THESE. TRUCKS

02:23:02.507 --> 02:23:03.408
ALONG WITHOUT A LOT OF

02:23:03.474 --> 02:23:05.209
REGULATIONS CHANGED- AND WE'VE

02:23:05.276 --> 02:23:08.212
HEARD AB FIVE IT WAS HUGE. IT

02:23:08.279 --> 02:23:09.914
IMPACTED A LOT OF THE TRUCKING

02:23:09.981 --> 02:23:11.683
BUSINESS. I DON'T SEE THAT

02:23:11.749 --> 02:23:12.984
CHANGING I DON'T THINK THAT

02:23:13.051 --> 02:23:14.953
THE- ADMINISTRATION OR- THEY'RE

02:23:15.019 --> 02:23:16.287
GONNA BE ROLLING THAT BACK ANY

02:23:16.354 --> 02:23:17.822
TIME SOON BUT THOSE WERE SMALL

02:23:17.889 --> 02:23:20.525
BUSINESSES THAT WE- BASICALLY.

02:23:20.591 --> 02:23:22.060
THAT CHANGE THE WAY THE RULES

02:23:22.126 --> 02:23:24.195
WERE OR ARE. BEING IMPLEMENTED

02:23:24.262 --> 02:23:27.832
SO- SO THAT THAT BEEN AROUND

02:23:27.899 --> 02:23:29.033
FOR SOE SO WHEN YOU TALK

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:32.470
ABOUT- IMPLEMENTING YOU KNOW

02:23:32.537 --> 02:23:34.806
CDL LICENSES EASIER QUICKER I

02:23:34.872 --> 02:23:36.207
MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS

02:23:36.274 --> 02:23:38.376
THAT WE HAVE THE LAWS THAT WE

02:23:38.443 --> 02:23:38.977
HAPPEN YOU'RE GONNA ADD WEIGHT

02:23:39.043 --> 02:23:40.778
TO A TRUCK. AND THEN YOU'RE

02:23:40.845 --> 02:23:42.814
GONNA PUT IT IN OFFICE SOMEBODY

02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:45.049
WHO'S NOT EXPERIENCED AS MUCH

02:23:45.116 --> 02:23:47.452
AS SOME IN A TRUCK THIS NOW GOT

02:23:47.518 --> 02:23:49.087
EVEN MORE WEIGHT ON IT I MEAN I

02:23:49.153 --> 02:23:52.623
THINK THAT'S- A RECIPE FOR- IN

02:23:52.690 --> 02:23:54.392
SOME DANGER ON THE ROADS. AND

02:23:54.459 --> 02:23:56.894
ALSO TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

02:23:56.961 --> 02:23:57.528
AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SET UP

02:23:57.595 --> 02:24:00.231
FOR. TYPICALLY AN EIGHTY

02:24:00.298 --> 02:24:02.900
THOUSAND POUND. GVW UNLESS YOU

02:24:02.967 --> 02:24:04.669
SPREAD IT OUT OVER LONGER

02:24:04.736 --> 02:24:07.338
LINKED OF AXLES SO- I'M I'M IN

02:24:07.405 --> 02:24:08.606
FAVOR OF THAT ANYTHING NEEDS TO

02:24:08.673 --> 02:24:10.274
BE SOME OBVIOUSLY SOME THOUGHT

02:24:10.341 --> 02:24:11.876
PUT INTO THAT PROCESS BUT THE

02:24:11.943 --> 02:24:12.643
BIGGEST CHALLENGE I THINK WE

02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:15.680
FACE. AS THE LACK OF TALENT AND

02:24:15.747 --> 02:24:17.382
OF AVAILABILITY AND QUITE

02:24:17.448 --> 02:24:19.117
FRANKLY THAT'S DUE TO. I THINK

02:24:19.183 --> 02:24:20.518
SOME OF THE LAWS AND THE

02:24:20.585 --> 02:24:21.919
PETITIONS THAT WE'VE DONE HERE

02:24:21.986 --> 02:24:24.222
AND WITH ALSO THE WITH THE

02:24:24.288 --> 02:24:25.990
EXTENSION OF. UNEMPLOYMENT FOR

02:24:26.057 --> 02:24:27.992
EVER I MEAN WE'RE LIKE I CANNOT

02:24:28.059 --> 02:24:29.761
TELL YOU IN EVERY BUSINESS I GO

02:24:29.827 --> 02:24:30.928
BY IS LOOKING FOR PEOPLE AND

02:24:30.995 --> 02:24:32.463
WE'RE STILL CONTINUING TO LET

02:24:32.530 --> 02:24:35.066
PEOPLE. DRAW UNEMPLOYMENT

02:24:35.133 --> 02:24:36.901
BENEFITS AND NOT HAVE TO GO

02:24:36.968 --> 02:24:37.502
BACK TO WORK WHEN THERE'S JOBS

02:24:37.568 --> 02:24:40.271
AVAILABLE. SO IS THERE ANY BEEN

02:24:40.338 --> 02:24:41.973
ANY THOUGHT PUT INTO THE FACT

02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:43.975
THAT WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE BACK

02:24:44.042 --> 02:24:46.244
IN THE WORK FORCE- SINCE THE

02:24:46.310 --> 02:24:48.179
PANDEMIC THERE'S BEEN BILLIONS

02:24:48.246 --> 02:24:50.248
OF DOLLARS SPENT. ON ALLOWING

02:24:50.314 --> 02:24:52.683
PEOPLE TO JUST STAY HOME. YEAH

02:24:52.750 --> 02:24:54.218
WELL I MEAN WE HAD IS A LONGER

02:24:54.285 --> 02:24:55.319
CONVERSATION I'D BE HAPPY TO

02:24:55.386 --> 02:24:56.621
HAVE IT WITH YOU OFFLINE BUT I

02:24:56.687 --> 02:24:57.755
THINK WE HAVE LOOKED

02:24:57.822 --> 02:24:59.857
EXTENSIVELY AT THE CAUSES OF-

02:24:59.924 --> 02:25:01.359
SOMETIMES IMBALANCE IS

02:25:01.426 --> 02:25:03.361
IMBALANCES IN THE JOB MARKET

02:25:03.428 --> 02:25:04.195
AND WHY WE CONTINUE HAVE

02:25:04.262 --> 02:25:06.864
UNEMPLOYMENT- I THINK THAT MOST

02:25:06.931 --> 02:25:07.865
ECONOMISTS AGREE AND IF YOU

02:25:07.932 --> 02:25:09.133
LOOK AROUND THE COUNTRY AT AT

02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:10.601
AT AT AT STATE WITH A ROLL BACK

02:25:10.668 --> 02:25:12.437
ON EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. UP

02:25:12.503 --> 02:25:14.472
EARLIER THAN THAN WE DID THAT

02:25:14.539 --> 02:25:15.540
THERE'S THERE DOESN'T APPEAR TO

02:25:15.606 --> 02:25:17.341
BE CAUSE AND EFFECT- I THINK

02:25:17.408 --> 02:25:19.444
THE REASONS PEOPLE BUT YOU KNOW

02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:20.278
THAT UNEMPLOYMENT WE WE'VE HAD

02:25:20.344 --> 02:25:22.480
KIND OF A OF A LITTLE BIT OF A

02:25:22.547 --> 02:25:25.850
ON EVEN RETURN TO- JOB GROWTH

02:25:25.917 --> 02:25:27.085
ALTHOUGH JOBS ARE GROWING

02:25:27.151 --> 02:25:28.186
CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LEAD

02:25:28.252 --> 02:25:29.253
THE NATION IN JOB GROWTH RIGHT

02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:30.254
IT IT'S WITH YOU KNOW SINCE

02:25:30.321 --> 02:25:32.056
JANUARY IT'S BEEN MORE THAN A

02:25:32.123 --> 02:25:33.091
HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS A MONTH-

02:25:33.157 --> 02:25:34.692
BUT I THINK WE- WE CONTINUE TO

02:25:34.759 --> 02:25:35.793
LOOK AT THAT AND TRY TO

02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:37.061
UNDERSTAND IT WHILE INVESTING

02:25:37.128 --> 02:25:38.229
IN JOB TRAINING AND OTHER

02:25:38.296 --> 02:25:39.797
THINGS. TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE

02:25:39.864 --> 02:25:40.998
MAKE THAT TRANSITION BACK INTO

02:25:41.065 --> 02:25:42.400
THE WORKFORCE AND TO GROW JOBS

02:25:42.467 --> 02:25:43.468
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FIT

02:25:43.534 --> 02:25:44.502
THAT WERE YOU KNOW MANAGING

02:25:44.569 --> 02:25:46.237
ECONOMY WAY THAT ALLOWS JOBS TO

02:25:46.304 --> 02:25:47.672
GROW ITSELF YEAH WE AGAIN THAT

02:25:47.738 --> 02:25:49.140
RESULTS A LITTLE UNEVEN BUT THE

02:25:49.207 --> 02:25:50.041
TRAJECTORIES IN THE RIGHT

02:25:50.108 --> 02:25:52.110
DIRECTION BUT I'M HEADED TO

02:25:52.176 --> 02:25:53.377
DISCUSS AT LENGTH WITH YOU. AT

02:25:53.444 --> 02:25:55.613
ANY TIME MY PLEASURE THAT THE

02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:57.248
ONE THE ONE THING I THINK THAT

02:25:57.315 --> 02:25:59.317
IS YOU WILL TALK ABOUT. AYE MY

02:25:59.383 --> 02:26:00.318
FRUSTRATION WITH GOVERNMENT AS

02:26:00.384 --> 02:26:01.619
WE JUST THROW MONEY AT IT THINK

02:26:01.686 --> 02:26:02.353
IT'S GOING TO FIX IT THAT

02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:04.088
DOESN'T ALWAYS FIX THE PROBLEM-

02:26:04.155 --> 02:26:05.523
OBVIOUSLY HELPS AND THE THINGS

02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:07.191
THAT THAT ARE PROPOSED OR LONG

02:26:07.258 --> 02:26:09.160
TERM RIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:26:09.227 --> 02:26:11.062
A CRISIS RIGHT NOW. AND SEND

02:26:11.129 --> 02:26:12.763
AND THE SHORT TERM I THINK HIS

02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:14.499
OBVIOUSLY WE NEED MORE SPACE

02:26:14.565 --> 02:26:17.869
RIGHT FOR THE- CONTAINERS AND

02:26:17.935 --> 02:26:18.469
NUMBER TWO WE NEED TO BE ABLE

02:26:18.536 --> 02:26:20.037
TO MOVE THOSE CONTAINERS. THE

02:26:20.104 --> 02:26:22.306
REAL SHORTAGES THIRTY THOUSAND

02:26:22.373 --> 02:26:23.441
TRUCK DRIVERS AND IN CALIFORNIA

02:26:23.508 --> 02:26:25.376
ALONE AND I THINK IT'S LIKE A

02:26:25.443 --> 02:26:26.577
MILLIONS NATIONWIDE THAT WERE

02:26:26.644 --> 02:26:28.312
SHORT AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO

02:26:28.379 --> 02:26:29.680
GET FIXED EITHER OVERTIME OVER

02:26:29.747 --> 02:26:31.282
A QUICK TIME RIGHT EVEN THOUGH

02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:32.416
THE RATES ARE GOING UP THE

02:26:32.483 --> 02:26:34.585
PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR PAYING. TOP

02:26:34.652 --> 02:26:36.254
DOLLAR FOR QUALIFIED DRIVERS

02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:39.023
RIGHT AND I DID IT IS THAT IS

02:26:39.090 --> 02:26:40.525
THAT IS ONE OF THE FOR SURE ONE

02:26:40.591 --> 02:26:41.459
OF THE TRUMP POINTS IN THE

02:26:41.526 --> 02:26:43.361
SYSTEM WE HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS

02:26:43.427 --> 02:26:44.095
FOR HOW TO VESTED OVER THE

02:26:44.162 --> 02:26:46.063
LONGER TERM- IN THE MEANTIME

02:26:46.130 --> 02:26:47.265
WHICH HAVE TRY TO GET THINGS

02:26:47.331 --> 02:26:49.634
MOVING AGAIN AND HOPE THAT THAT

02:26:49.700 --> 02:26:54.839
WORKFORCE AND. AND THEN MY LAST

02:26:54.906 --> 02:26:55.439
POINT WOULD BE THIS IS JUST TO

02:26:55.506 --> 02:26:55.973
STAY A MAN IS THAT. IN THE

02:26:56.040 --> 02:26:57.241
REGULATORY. IS REAP THREE POWER

02:26:57.308 --> 02:26:58.442
THOSE A QUICK. UPGRADING YOUR-

02:26:58.509 --> 02:26:59.577
TO MEET THIS STANDARDS OF THE

02:26:59.644 --> 02:27:01.712
PORTS- IS NOT JUST FOR SMALL

02:27:01.779 --> 02:27:03.114
BUSINESS FOR LARGE BUSINESSES A

02:27:03.181 --> 02:27:04.582
HUGE IMPACT AND SOME OF THE

02:27:04.649 --> 02:27:06.217
TECHNOLOGIES. ARE I MEAN WHEN

02:27:06.284 --> 02:27:07.752
YOU I LOOKED AT THE- EXECUTIVE

02:27:07.818 --> 02:27:09.253
ORDERS TALK ABOUT A THOUSAND

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:10.454
DRIVES TEXT BUT YOU CAN'T EVEN

02:27:10.521 --> 02:27:11.422
BUY THOSE TODAY. THEY'RE NOT

02:27:11.489 --> 02:27:13.157
EVEN AVAILABLE. IF YOU HAD HIM

02:27:13.224 --> 02:27:14.492
SITTING THERE. THEY'RE NOT

02:27:14.559 --> 02:27:16.360
THEY'RE NOT. YOU CAN GO TO THE

02:27:16.427 --> 02:27:18.196
LOT AND PICK THOSE UP. SO THOSE

02:27:18.262 --> 02:27:21.332
ARE THESE ARE LONG TERM RIGHT-

02:27:21.399 --> 02:27:23.267
SOLUTIONS TO WE NEED A SHORT

02:27:23.334 --> 02:27:24.802
TERM FIX FOR RIGHT NOW AND THAT

02:27:24.869 --> 02:27:26.270

02:27:26.337 --> 02:27:27.905
YOU'VE HEARD IS THAT. OBVIOUSLY

02:27:27.972 --> 02:27:28.906
THE OTHER PORTS NUMBER ONE

02:27:28.973 --> 02:27:32.810
NUMBER TWO- BEING ABLE TO NOT.

02:27:32.877 --> 02:27:33.578
IT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE

02:27:33.644 --> 02:27:35.379
ENVIRONMENT. CHANGE ALL THE

02:27:35.446 --> 02:27:36.714
RULES BUT FOR THE SHORT TERM WE

02:27:36.781 --> 02:27:37.848
NEED SOME RELIEF SO THAT WE CAN

02:27:37.915 --> 02:27:39.250
ACTUALLY GET THE SUPPLY CHAIN

02:27:39.317 --> 02:27:40.785
AND THEN DO. THE LONG TERM

02:27:40.851 --> 02:27:42.787
EFFECTS THANK YOU. THANK IT IS

02:27:42.853 --> 02:27:43.754
ONE HIGHLIGHT THE RESPONSE YOUR

02:27:43.821 --> 02:27:45.423
FIRST QUESTION. WHICH IS THE

02:27:45.489 --> 02:27:46.724
ONE THING WE CAN DO. AND THE

02:27:46.791 --> 02:27:48.326
RESPONSE WAS GET THE EMPTIES

02:27:48.392 --> 02:27:51.162
PAPA DOC- AND HOW THAT'S DONE

02:27:51.229 --> 02:27:52.396
IT'S DONE A VARIETY WAS ONE OF

02:27:52.463 --> 02:27:53.164
THEM ONE OF MAIN WAYS IS THE

02:27:53.231 --> 02:27:54.599
SENT OVER SWEEPER SHIPS. RIGHT

02:27:54.665 --> 02:27:56.434
RIGHT SO THEY TAKE HIM BACK. TO

02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:58.169
THE IMPORTER RIGHT TO GO BACK

02:27:58.236 --> 02:27:59.003
WE NEED TO GET THOSE OFF THE

02:27:59.070 --> 02:28:00.304
DOCK THAT'S WHAT'S ASSOCIATED

02:28:00.371 --> 02:28:01.339
WITH THAT HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE.

02:28:01.405 --> 02:28:02.406
BECAUSE WITH HIS SITTING THERE

02:28:02.473 --> 02:28:04.542
TOO LONG- THAT THEY WANT TO

02:28:04.609 --> 02:28:05.776
ATTACH THAT FEE SO THERE'S AN

02:28:05.843 --> 02:28:09.614
INCENTIVE. FOR THOSE FOLKS TO

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:10.181
GET THOSE EMPLOYEES OFF THE

02:28:10.248 --> 02:28:13.351
DOCK. WITH SO MEMBER GIPSON

NOTES- WITH RESPECT TO- THERE

02:28:27.898 --> 02:28:30.034
IS ABSOLUTELY A SHORTAGE THERE

02:28:30.101 --> 02:28:31.002
WE ARE IN NEED MAKE WHEN IT

02:28:31.068 --> 02:28:33.437
COMES DOWN TO TRUCK DRIVERS

02:28:33.504 --> 02:28:35.306
BECAUSE AS I LOOK FROM MY

02:28:35.373 --> 02:28:37.775
LIENS- VISITING THE PORT

02:28:37.842 --> 02:28:39.243
SEVERAL TIMES WHEN THE

02:28:39.310 --> 02:28:42.513
PRESIDENT- DID EXECUTIVE ORDERS

02:28:42.580 --> 02:28:44.715
WE HAVE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY

02:28:44.782 --> 02:28:45.983
THOUSAND CONTAINERS- ON THE

02:28:46.050 --> 02:28:48.519
DOCK- AND NOT ENOUGH TRUCK

02:28:48.586 --> 02:28:50.488
DRIVERS TO MOVE THAT STUFF AND

02:28:50.554 --> 02:28:52.690
THEN WE HAVE. FIFTY TO SEVENTY

02:28:52.757 --> 02:28:55.159

IT'S THERE'S A NUMBER OF

02:28:59.597 --> 02:29:00.131
DIFFERENT THINGS I THINK THAT

02:29:00.197 --> 02:29:02.366
WE CAN FIX- BUT THIS LEADS TO

02:29:02.433 --> 02:29:04.402
MY QUESTION AND MY QUESTION IS

02:29:04.468 --> 02:29:05.870
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT

02:29:05.936 --> 02:29:06.837
SCRATCH OUT THE WERE POSSIBLE

02:29:06.904 --> 02:29:08.272
WE NEEDED TO HAPPEN WE

02:29:08.339 --> 02:29:11.709
IDENTIFIED. A FREAK OR GOODS

02:29:11.776 --> 02:29:14.345
MOVE MOVEMENT A KEY PERSON IN

02:29:14.412 --> 02:29:16.013
THE HORSESHOE THAT CAN

02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:17.815
COORDINATE THE AGENCIES GO

02:29:17.882 --> 02:29:21.352
BEARS- CAL S. T. A. AND ALSO

02:29:21.419 --> 02:29:22.486
CARBON OTHERS BECAUSE GOING

02:29:22.553 --> 02:29:25.289
BACK TO SHERMAN- O'DONNELL- HAS

02:29:25.356 --> 02:29:27.625
INDICATED WE HAVE A NUMBER OF

02:29:27.692 --> 02:29:29.427
POLICYMAKERS WE ARE LEGISLATIVE

02:29:29.493 --> 02:29:30.795
BODY THE GOVERNOR HAS THE

02:29:30.861 --> 02:29:32.163
AUTHORITY AS WELL AS CARBON

02:29:32.229 --> 02:29:33.230
OTHERS AND THERE'S NO

02:29:33.297 --> 02:29:35.333
COORDINATION AND THEN WE WILL

02:29:35.399 --> 02:29:36.200
THERE'S NO COORDINATION THERE'S

THAT PARTICULAR BILL AND THE

02:32:12.690 --> 02:32:14.992
POTENTIAL FOR HUNDREDS BECAUSE

WE'RE NO LONGER BE PRODUCING

02:32:16.126 --> 02:32:17.928

SIPS IN OUR PORT THAT

02:32:30.307 --> 02:32:32.843

HUNDRED COMING IN AT ONE GIVEN

02:32:34.745 --> 02:32:36.413

YEAH I THINK WE DID THAT BUT

02:32:53.230 --> 02:32:53.964

MORE DEMAND ON THE PORTS AND-

02:32:56.066 --> 02:32:57.134

02:50:30.987 --> 02:50:32.422

ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF OUR

02:51:13.663 --> 02:51:15.798
NORMAL IMPORT LEVELS. THEN

02:51:15.865 --> 02:51:18.067
SUDDENLY WE STARTED TO SEE MANY

02:51:18.134 --> 02:51:20.036
TRENDS HAPPEN. EMPTY CONTAINERS

02:51:20.103 --> 02:51:21.938
COME BACK TO OUR PORT COMPLEXES

02:51:22.005 --> 02:51:23.106
THE NEED TO GET THOSE BACK TO

02:51:23.172 --> 02:51:25.108
ASIA TO PRE POSITION THOSE

02:51:25.174 --> 02:51:26.776
ASSETS FOR WHEN THE FACTORIES

02:51:26.843 --> 02:51:28.444

02:51:28.511 --> 02:51:31.180
CLOSELY WE WATCHED ENERGY USAGE

02:51:31.247 --> 02:51:32.548
TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND EVEN

02:51:32.615 --> 02:51:34.250
POLLUTION IN CHINA TO SEE WHAT

02:51:34.317 --> 02:51:35.818

02:51:35.885 --> 02:51:37.487
TO OUR LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS.

02:51:37.553 --> 02:51:39.789
AND THOSE PHONE CALLS YIELDED

02:51:39.856 --> 02:51:41.557
ON A NIGHTLY BASIS. THEN THE

02:51:41.624 --> 02:51:43.059
STRENGTH OF THE AMERICAN

GREATLY IN SO MANY AREAS OF OUR

ECONOMY IS A CHALLENGE FOR

02:52:49.025 --> 02:52:50.059
THOSE COMPANIES WERE TRYING TO

02:52:50.126 --> 02:52:52.095

WE CONTINUE AT A VERY HIGH CLIP

02:53:18.454 --> 02:53:20.523
IN THAT SPENDING. I ANTICIPATED

DOLLARS. CHELSEA'S IN

INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT SO TO

03:12:25.600 --> 03:12:29.638
YOUR QUESTION. I THINK IN MY

03:12:29.704 --> 03:12:30.438
SIX YEARS OF THE FEDERAL

03:12:30.505 --> 03:12:31.806
MARITIME COMMISSION BEING

03:12:31.873 --> 03:12:34.976
CHAIRMAN ARE IN WASHINGTON DC.

03:12:35.043 --> 03:12:37.045
I HAD A UNIQUE VIEW OF HAVING

03:12:37.112 --> 03:12:38.713
THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL OF

03:12:38.780 --> 03:12:39.748

CEOS OF THE MAJOR INTERNATIONAL

CARRIERS. AND IT IS FAIR TO

03:12:45.220 --> 03:12:48.223
SAY. THAT THE INVESTMENT IN

03:12:48.290 --> 03:12:49.925
SOME OF OUR COMPETITIVE PARTS.

03:12:49.991 --> 03:12:52.360
OF OUR EXCEEDED WHAT I SAW IN

03:12:52.427 --> 03:12:55.463
CALIFORNIA. BUT THE GOOD NEWS I

03:12:55.530 --> 03:12:56.731
THINK THAT WE'RE HAVING A VERY

03:12:56.798 --> 03:12:57.832
PROPER CONVERSATION BECAUSE I

03:12:57.899 --> 03:13:00.001
THINK MOVING FORWARD I THINK

03:13:00.068 --> 03:13:02.103
IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS GOVERNOR

03:13:02.170 --> 03:13:03.905
AND THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE

03:13:03.972 --> 03:13:06.508
STAKEHOLDERS MARIJUANA AS HAS

03:13:06.574 --> 03:13:08.677
BEEN REPRESENTATIVE. WHAT ARE

03:13:08.743 --> 03:13:10.145
WE DOING THIS CRISIS OTHER

03:13:10.211 --> 03:13:11.513
LESSONS LEARNED OVER THIS

03:13:11.579 --> 03:13:14.049
CRISIS. PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY

03:13:14.115 --> 03:13:16.718

03:13:21.389 --> 03:13:23.158
WE WERE UNPREPARED TO ADDRESS

03:13:23.224 --> 03:13:25.560
TODAY. SIMPLY BECAUSE WE

03:13:25.627 --> 03:13:27.529
WEREN'T WILLING TO HAVE A

03:13:27.595 --> 03:13:28.997
TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE TO THE

03:13:29.064 --> 03:13:31.066
SUPPLY CHAIN. AND THE REQUIRED

03:13:31.132 --> 03:13:32.901
INVESTMENT THAT'S NEEDED IN THE

03:13:32.968 --> 03:13:37.205
NATION'S LARGEST PORT COMPLEX.

03:13:37.272 --> 03:13:38.273
AND LESS I WILL SAY THIS.

03:13:38.340 --> 03:13:39.541
DURING DISAPPOINTED WAS

03:13:39.607 --> 03:13:43.511
DISRUPTED. FIRST OF ALL. DUE TO

03:13:43.578 --> 03:13:44.846
THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION AT THE

03:13:44.913 --> 03:13:48.083
U. S. IN WASHINGTON WITH THE

03:13:48.149 --> 03:13:51.252
TRADE WAR. THAT COMMENCED AND

03:13:51.319 --> 03:13:51.786
ALREADY DISRUPTION IN THE

03:13:51.853 --> 03:13:54.622
SUPPLY CHAIN. AND MANY OF US

03:13:54.689 --> 03:13:56.725
SAID AT THAT POINT THAT NO

03:13:56.791 --> 03:13:58.059
MATTER WHAT YOU DO ON THIS TURF

03:13:58.126 --> 03:14:00.795
ISSUE THAT WAS NOT. RECOMMENDED

03:14:00.862 --> 03:14:03.131
POLICY IT WASN'T- THE NEEDLE

03:14:03.198 --> 03:14:05.467
WITH REGARD TO THE IMPORTANCE

03:14:05.533 --> 03:14:07.102
OF THE TRANS PACIFIC TRADE

03:14:07.168 --> 03:14:10.372
ROUTE THAT IS THE WEST COAST

03:14:10.438 --> 03:14:12.107
UNITED STATES TO ASIAN. I WANT

03:14:12.173 --> 03:14:13.875
TO REMOVE HERE I DON'T SEE IS

03:14:13.942 --> 03:14:15.010
GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE

03:14:15.076 --> 03:14:17.779

ABOUT TODAY. WE KNEW YESTERDAY.

03:14:22.684 --> 03:14:24.419

03:14:24.486 --> 03:14:26.554
LOST NOT LOSE THIS OPPORTUNITY.

03:14:26.621 --> 03:14:29.357
TO MAKE. ROADS WHAT WE NEED TO

03:14:29.424 --> 03:14:31.426

THE SYSTEM WERE LOADING OUT

GEOGRAPHIES AT THE PRESENT TIME

03:15:48.503 --> 03:15:49.971
THINK OF SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC

03:15:50.038 --> 03:15:51.539
PORTS AS WELL AS GULF COAST

03:15:51.606 --> 03:15:53.241

FAST AS WE CAN TO WE GOT INTO A

03:15:55.477 --> 03:15:56.711
LITTLE BIT OF A DISCUSSION OVER

03:15:56.778 --> 03:15:58.146
THE WEEKEND WITH SOME OF OUR

03:15:58.213 --> 03:15:59.280
COLLEAGUES IN THE TRUCKING

RETURNED BY THE TRUCKING

03:16:07.489 --> 03:16:09.724
COMMUNITY THAT IS MANAGEABLE

03:16:09.791 --> 03:16:11.459
BUT WE HAVE TO DO IS MAKE THE

03:16:11.526 --> 03:16:13.995
LINER SHIPPING NUMBERS ON HOW

03:16:14.062 --> 03:16:15.330
MANY MPS THEY'LL RECEIVE EVERY

03:16:15.396 --> 03:16:17.599
DAY PUBLIC INFORMATION THEN USE

03:16:17.665 --> 03:16:20.368
SOMETHING LIKE THE PORT

03:16:20.435 --> 03:16:20.935
OPTIMIZER TO DO JUST THAT.

03:16:21.002 --> 03:16:22.370
SOLVE THEY'RE NOT CLOGGING UP

03:16:22.437 --> 03:16:23.204
THE SYSTEM IN FACT IN LOS

03:16:23.271 --> 03:16:25.807
ANGELES TODAY WE HAVE SEVENTY

03:16:25.874 --> 03:16:26.407
NINE THOUSAND IMPORTS ON THE

03:16:26.474 --> 03:16:28.476
DOCKS. ABOUT TWENTY FIVE

03:16:28.543 --> 03:16:30.945
THOUSAND EXPORTS AND FIFTY FIVE

03:16:31.012 --> 03:16:31.880
THOUSAND CONTAINER UNITS OF

EMPTIES. FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND

03:16:33.982 --> 03:16:35.850
REPRESENTS ABOUT FOUR DAYS OR

FOUR DAYS WORTH OF WORK THE

03:16:37.318 --> 03:16:38.953
LONGSHOREMEN HAVE TO LOAD THOSE

03:16:39.020 --> 03:16:40.288
EMPTIES BACK UP ON TO THE SHIP

03:16:40.355 --> 03:16:42.824
AGAIN A VERY MANAGEABLE. NUMBER

03:16:42.891 --> 03:16:44.692
BUT AT THE SAME TIME PORT ENVOY

03:16:44.759 --> 03:16:46.461
GIAMPA COREY HAS BEEN IMPLORING

03:16:46.528 --> 03:16:48.129
THE LINER SHIPPING COMPANIES TO

03:16:48.196 --> 03:16:49.631
BRING IN SOME EXTRA MUSCLES AND

03:16:49.697 --> 03:16:51.032
EVEN MOVE THOSE AT THE SOUTH

03:16:51.099 --> 03:16:52.467
FASTER TO LOOSEN UP THE

03:16:52.534 --> 03:16:54.536
SITUATION. SIMPLY BECAUSE OF

03:16:54.602 --> 03:16:56.771
WHAT YOU CORRECTLY SET SOME

03:16:56.838 --> 03:16:58.840
IMPORTERS. HOLDING ONTO

CONTAINERS LONGER ON THE PORK

03:17:00.808 --> 03:17:03.178
THAT'S AN ADDED SEGMENTS ON THE

03:17:03.244 --> 03:17:04.579
STAR MAX THAT MAKES THE

03:17:04.646 --> 03:17:06.147
SITUATION A LITTLE BIT TOUGHER

03:17:06.214 --> 03:17:08.116
TO HAVE MANEUVERABILITY. AND IF

03:17:08.183 --> 03:17:09.484
I MAY GO BACK TO ASSEMBLY

03:17:09.551 --> 03:17:11.786
MEMBER FONG'S- THREE QUESTIONS-

03:17:14.822 --> 03:17:17.325
ASSEMBLY MEMBER- THE- THE-

ACTIVITY OF THE DOCKS IS REALLY

03:17:18.960 --> 03:17:20.795
FAST. THINGS ARE MOVING QUICKLY

03:17:20.862 --> 03:17:22.197
IT'S GETTING THAT PRODUCT OUT

03:17:22.263 --> 03:17:24.098
THE GATE AND IF IT DOESN'T NEED

03:17:24.165 --> 03:17:24.699
TO GO NOW JUST MOVE IT TO THE

03:17:24.766 --> 03:17:26.234
SIDE FOR THE TIME BEING.

03:17:26.301 --> 03:17:27.602
INVESTED BY OTHER STATES THIS

03:17:27.669 --> 03:17:29.637
STARTED BACK IN THE EARLY TWO

03:17:29.704 --> 03:17:30.939
THOUSANDS WHEN MANY OF OUR

03:17:31.005 --> 03:17:33.074
IMPORT EXPORT COMPANIES BEGAN

WE'RE GONNA TURN THESE AROUND A

03:19:06.634 --> 03:19:08.169

GOOD PAYING THEY CAN CREATE

03:19:11.005 --> 03:19:13.207
GOOD MIDDLE CLASS INCOMES BUT

03:19:13.274 --> 03:19:15.343
WE GOT TO ATTRACT RECRUIT. AND

03:19:15.410 --> 03:19:17.979
RETAIN FOLKS TO SEE WHAT THEY

03:19:18.046 --> 03:19:19.614
COULD DO IN OUR INDUSTRY AND

03:19:19.681 --> 03:19:21.416
LASTLY ON YOUR LAND LOCATIONS I

03:19:21.482 --> 03:19:23.518
WOULD SAY TO STRATEGIC SITES

03:19:23.584 --> 03:19:24.719
ONE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE

03:19:24.786 --> 03:19:26.521
BECAUSE A THIRD OF ALL OF OUR

03:19:26.587 --> 03:19:28.289
CARGO ON THE IMPORT SIDE GOES

03:19:28.356 --> 03:19:30.725
OUT TO THE I. E. FOR RE

03:19:30.792 --> 03:19:32.060
HANDLING AND- DISTRIBUTION. THE

03:19:32.126 --> 03:19:33.995

LONG BEACH EVEN IF IT IS. IN

03:19:37.365 --> 03:19:39.133
THE HIGHER LOW DESERT SO WE CAN

03:19:39.200 --> 03:19:39.934
GET OUT THERE WILL HAVE A

03:19:40.001 --> 03:19:41.302
SECURE ENVIRONMENT WOULD DATE

03:19:41.369 --> 03:19:43.071
AROUND WHERE ALL THOSE CAPITAL

03:19:43.137 --> 03:19:44.172
ASSETS ARE. AND WE COULD

03:19:44.238 --> 03:19:45.873
RETRIEVE THEM QUICKLY. IF THERE

03:19:45.940 --> 03:19:48.109
IS A THIRD DUE TO VOLUME NEEDS

03:19:48.176 --> 03:19:49.377
IT ALSO SHOULD BE A DECENT

03:19:49.444 --> 03:19:51.212
PROXIMITY LIKE A LOS ALAMEDA

03:19:59.487 --> 03:20:00.221
HUNDREDS OF PARCELS STREWN

03:20:00.288 --> 03:20:01.723
THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND IT'S

THOSE CONTAINERS AND CHASSIS IS

03:20:04.325 --> 03:20:05.827

UNPRECEDENTED TIME I'VE BEEN

HERE- THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO

03:37:02.242 --> 03:37:04.044
HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE

03:37:04.111 --> 03:37:05.979
PANDEMIC EXPOSED A WEAKNESS IN

03:37:06.046 --> 03:37:07.347
THE SUPPLY CHAIN OR THE SUPPLY

03:37:07.414 --> 03:37:09.149
CHAIN WAS ALREADY SHOWING THAT

03:37:09.216 --> 03:37:11.418
WEAKNESS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC-

03:37:11.485 --> 03:37:15.655
BUT I THINK THE LOW DWELL TIME

03:37:15.722 --> 03:37:17.224
TWO DAYS AND RAILYARDS STUFF

03:37:17.290 --> 03:37:19.159

THE PORTS OF LA AND LONG BEACH

03:37:20.660 --> 03:37:22.229
SUGGESTS THAT THE SUPPLY CHAIN

03:37:22.295 --> 03:37:24.398
WASN'T BROKEN WHAT WE'VE DONE

03:37:24.464 --> 03:37:26.066

COMMERCE ENGINE WE ARE WE BOTH

03:37:34.074 --> 03:37:35.409
AT THE MANUFACTURING COMPONENT

03:37:35.475 --> 03:37:36.977
OF SUPPLY CHAIN AS WELL AS THE

03:37:37.043 --> 03:37:38.645
DELIVERY COMPONENT I WE'VE

03:37:38.712 --> 03:37:40.680
REPLACED THAT OLD MACHINE WHICH

03:37:40.747 --> 03:37:42.082
HAS BEEN SIXTY YEARS IN THE

03:37:42.149 --> 03:37:43.417
MAKING IT STARTED BACK IN THE

03:37:43.483 --> 03:37:44.618
MID FIFTIES WITH MALCOLM

03:37:44.684 --> 03:37:46.286
MACLEAN'S INNOVATION. OF THE

03:37:46.353 --> 03:37:47.954
SEABORNE CONTAINER AND IT'S

03:37:48.021 --> 03:37:49.656
GROWN SINCE THEN BUT WE ARE WE

03:37:49.723 --> 03:37:51.792
ARE WE ARE NOW RETOOLING OR

03:37:51.858 --> 03:37:53.627
REBUILDING THAT MACHINE ON THE

03:37:53.693 --> 03:37:55.462
FLY AND IS DRIVEN BY

03:37:55.529 --> 03:37:57.798
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CONSUMER

03:37:57.864 --> 03:37:59.733
EXPENDITURES YOU KNOW MORE

03:37:59.800 --> 03:38:02.302
GOODS AND SERVICES MORE ONLINE

03:38:02.369 --> 03:38:05.639
THAN IN STORE- AND WE ALSO SAW

03:38:05.705 --> 03:38:06.139
IN THE EARLY PORTION THE

03:38:06.206 --> 03:38:08.241
PANDEMIC. INVENTORIES DROP

03:38:08.308 --> 03:38:10.444
SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE SPRING AND

03:38:10.510 --> 03:38:12.512
SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE

03:38:12.579 --> 03:38:14.247
INVENTORIES NATIONALLY AMONG

RETAILERS READ ON ONE MONTH

03:38:16.450 --> 03:38:18.285
LEFT. SO VERY LOW INVENTORIES

03:38:18.351 --> 03:38:19.953
AND THEN THERE WAS THE BIG PUSH

03:38:20.020 --> 03:38:22.322
THE BIG PUSH TO RESTOCK AND TO

03:38:22.389 --> 03:38:24.791
PURCHASE AHEAD OF- THE

03:38:24.858 --> 03:38:26.226
CHRISTMAS SEASON AND TO

03:38:26.293 --> 03:38:28.895
ANTICIPATE A MANUFACTURING-

03:38:28.962 --> 03:38:32.032
SHORTFALL SO- WE WENT FROM A

03:38:32.098 --> 03:38:34.401
JUST IN TIME DELIVERY SYSTEM.

03:38:34.468 --> 03:38:35.936
TO ADJUSTING CASE DELIVERY

03:38:36.002 --> 03:38:37.904
SYSTEM SO A DRAMATIC INCREASE

03:38:37.971 --> 03:38:40.173
IN IN VOLUMES THAT YOU SEE AT

03:38:40.240 --> 03:38:42.709
THE PORT SENATE THE RAILYARDS-

03:38:42.776 --> 03:38:44.611
THROUGH AUGUST OF TWENTY ONE

03:38:44.678 --> 03:38:47.948
BNSF MOVED MORE CONTAINERS-

03:38:48.014 --> 03:38:49.916
THROUGH OUR- INTERMODAL YARDS

03:38:49.983 --> 03:38:51.885
AT THE SAME POINT. IN THAT THE

03:38:51.952 --> 03:38:54.154
SAME POINT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

03:38:54.221 --> 03:38:55.055
WHICH WAS THE PREVIOUS RECORD

03:38:55.121 --> 03:38:59.359
YEAR. BOB SO WHEN YOU WON'T

03:38:59.426 --> 03:39:00.126
LET'S TALK ABOUT RAIL

03:39:00.193 --> 03:39:01.595
INTERMODAL. THEY THEY ARE ALL A

03:39:01.661 --> 03:39:03.363
THROUGH- VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT

03:39:03.430 --> 03:39:04.998
MR CONSTANTLY ON SAID ABOUT THE

03:39:05.065 --> 03:39:06.299
PORTS WE ARE ALL ABOUT

03:39:06.366 --> 03:39:07.501
THROUGHPUT WE ARE NOT DESIGNED

03:39:07.567 --> 03:39:09.503
OR BUILT. FOR LONG ERM

03:39:09.569 --> 03:39:13.106
STORAGE- SO IF THE ENGAGED

03:39:13.173 --> 03:39:14.975
EXCEEDS ADVOCATING OF

03:39:15.041 --> 03:39:17.744
CONTAINERS. OF THE RESULT IS

03:39:17.811 --> 03:39:18.712

THAT'S GETTING BACK TO THE TO

03:46:19.165 --> 03:46:20.500
THE PHRASE I USED BEFORE WE

03:46:20.566 --> 03:46:22.802
MOVE FROM JUST IN TIME DELIVERY

03:46:22.869 --> 03:46:27.407

WE WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF OTHER

03:46:28.942 --> 03:46:29.876
SUGGEST HERE I THINK A

03:46:29.943 --> 03:46:32.578
PRACTICAL ONE- BUT WHY NOT A

DAY BLOCKING AND TACKLING-

03:46:44.524 --> 03:46:46.759
ASPECT OF THIS OF SOLVING THIS

03:46:46.826 --> 03:46:48.461
PROBLEM A JOINT OPERATIONS

THEY COME UP AND THAT OUGHT TO

03:47:14.887 --> 03:47:16.122
BE SOMETHING WE DO ON A REGULAR

03:47:16.189 --> 03:47:18.157

ON A ON A REAL TIME BASIS- I

03:47:37.143 --> 03:47:38.544
WOULD NOTE THAT THERE ARE TWO.

03:47:38.611 --> 03:47:39.879
THINGS IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT

03:47:39.946 --> 03:47:41.114
ARE HAPPENING THAT WILL HAVE

03:47:41.180 --> 03:47:43.116
SOME EFFECT HERE ONE IS OF THE

03:47:43.182 --> 03:47:44.684
DOMESTIC CONTAINERS IN THE

03:47:44.751 --> 03:47:46.386
GREATER UTILIZATION OF DOMESTIC

03:47:46.452 --> 03:47:49.589

03:47:51.157 --> 03:47:54.761
TRADE TO- A LOCAL FACILITY

03:47:54.827 --> 03:47:56.696
WHERE THERE OTHERS TRANSLOAD

03:47:56.763 --> 03:47:58.731
INTO DOMESTIC CONTAINERS LARGER

03:47:58.798 --> 03:48:00.400

OF DOMESTIC CONTAINERS

03:48:03.102 --> 03:48:05.071
INCREASE- THAT FREES UP

03:48:05.138 --> 03:48:06.172
INTERNATIONAL CONTAINERS

03:48:06.239 --> 03:48:07.974

BACK TO ASIA- BUT BUT- BUT

03:48:11.377 --> 03:48:15.148
LASTLY I WOULD SUGGEST THAT-

03:48:15.214 --> 03:48:16.416
WE'RE GONNA SEE ANALYZE. TO SEE

03:48:16.482 --> 03:48:19.919

THIS HIGHER THAN TYPICAL DEMAND

03:50:42.061 --> 03:50:43.329
FOR IMPORTS HAS RESULTED IN AN

03:50:43.396 --> 03:50:45.398
ACCESS OF EMPTY CONTAINERS IN

03:50:45.464 --> 03:50:46.999

THE TERMINAL IS ALREADY

03:52:20.760 --> 03:52:22.228
CONGESTED AND THEY NEED SPACE

TO UNLOAD SHIPS. THERE ARE ALSO

03:52:24.130 --> 03:52:25.731
CRITICALLY LOW ON CHASSIS IS

03:52:25.798 --> 03:52:26.932
WHICH MEANS THE TERMINAL CANNOT

03:52:26.999 --> 03:52:28.701
BE CLEARED OF IMPORTS. THE MORE

03:52:28.768 --> 03:52:30.102

MEMBERS HAVE MADE OFF ALL TIME

04:00:57.776 --> 04:01:00.679
PROFITS OVER THE LAST YEAR. AND

04:01:00.746 --> 04:01:03.248
DURING THE SAME PERIOD- ARE

04:01:03.315 --> 04:01:04.950
INDIVIDUAL CONTAINER COSTS HAVE

04:01:05.017 --> 04:01:07.386
RISEN. AND THAT WE WOULD HAVE

04:01:07.452 --> 04:01:09.488
TO AGREE ON AVERAGE. THESE

04:01:09.555 --> 04:01:11.690
INCREASES HAVE BEEN DRAMATIC. I

04:01:11.757 --> 04:01:14.193
GUESS MY QUESTION IS. YOUR

04:01:14.259 --> 04:01:15.227
MEMBERS ARE CHARGING MORE TO

04:01:15.294 --> 04:01:17.796
SHIP- CONTAINERS AND MAKING

04:01:17.863 --> 04:01:20.032
GREATER PROFITS. WHAT ADDED

04:01:20.098 --> 04:01:24.570
VALUE OUR- THE- POINT GETTING

04:01:24.636 --> 04:01:28.207
OR OR JUST LITERALLY TAKING

04:01:28.273 --> 04:01:31.610
ADVANTAGE OF A BAD SITUATION.

04:01:31.677 --> 04:01:34.146
THANK YOU SENATOR- CERTAINLY

04:01:34.213 --> 04:01:36.682
NOT THE LATTER THE- MARKET

04:01:36.748 --> 04:01:38.851
PLACE OBVIOUSLY DRIVES. WHAT

04:01:38.917 --> 04:01:40.452
FOLKS WERE CHARGING IT ALSO

04:01:40.519 --> 04:01:42.321
DRIVES THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND WE

04:01:42.387 --> 04:01:44.523
SEND THE SYSTEM THE SYSTEM IS

04:01:44.590 --> 04:01:47.226
OVERWHELMED WITH DEMAND- AND

04:01:47.292 --> 04:01:48.961
THE FACT THAT WE'RE SEEING

04:01:49.027 --> 04:01:50.896
SHIPS OFF SHORE HERE. IT WAS

04:01:50.963 --> 04:01:52.164
REFERENCED EARLIER IS NOT

04:01:52.231 --> 04:01:54.166
UNIQUE WE HAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY

04:01:54.233 --> 04:01:56.535
SHIPS WAITING BETWEEN THE PORTS

04:01:56.602 --> 04:01:58.737
OF SHANGHAI AND NINGBO AS WELL

04:01:58.804 --> 04:02:00.906
TRYING TO GET IN THAT LINE- SO

04:02:00.973 --> 04:02:02.774
WE HAVE A CAPACITY SHORTAGE.

04:02:02.841 --> 04:02:04.443
AND WE ARE MOVING WARSHIPS AND

04:02:04.509 --> 04:02:05.410
I'LL BRING MORE SHIPS IN THE

04:02:05.477 --> 04:02:08.447
SERVICE- SO YES THERE IS THE

04:02:08.513 --> 04:02:10.148
RESULT HIGHER PROFITABILITY

04:02:10.215 --> 04:02:11.383
ASSOCIATED WITH DOING MORE

04:02:11.450 --> 04:02:13.919
BUSINESS TO BE SURE. RATES ARE

04:02:13.986 --> 04:02:14.453
HIGHER THAN THEY'VE BEEN

04:02:14.519 --> 04:02:18.090
BEFORE- FOR SURE- BUT WE'RE

04:02:18.156 --> 04:02:19.324
MOVING MORE CARGO THAN EVER AS

04:02:19.391 --> 04:02:21.793
WELL SO. I THINK THE SHORT

04:02:21.860 --> 04:02:23.528
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS WHAT

04:02:23.595 --> 04:02:25.564
CAN BE THE MARKET PLACE RIGHT

04:02:25.631 --> 04:02:27.299
NOW IS SUSTAINABLE FROM ALWAYS

04:02:27.366 --> 04:02:29.635
SAYING- THERE ARE CERTAIN

04:02:29.701 --> 04:02:32.037
PROFITABILITY SWINGS THAT THAT

04:02:32.104 --> 04:02:35.641
PEOPLE WANT TO DISCUSS- BACK

04:02:35.707 --> 04:02:36.441
AND CERTAINLY YEAH DISCUSSION

04:02:36.508 --> 04:02:38.477
WE HAVE. BUT NO ONE BELIEVES

04:02:38.543 --> 04:02:39.544
THAT THIS MARKET PLACES

04:02:39.611 --> 04:02:41.513
SUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG TIME

04:02:41.580 --> 04:02:44.216
LONG TERM- AND- BUT I MIGHT

04:02:44.283 --> 04:02:46.451
ALSO POINT OUT THAT. THERE ARE

04:02:46.518 --> 04:02:48.387
BETTER MANY MANY YEARS WHERE

04:02:48.453 --> 04:02:51.523
ARE INDUSTRY WAS LOSING MONEY-

04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:52.958
WE'RE CHARGING NON COMPENSATORY

04:02:53.025 --> 04:02:59.364
RATES. FOR A LOT OF. THE

04:02:59.431 --> 04:03:00.532
CARRIAGE- BUT CARRIERS A THE

04:03:00.599 --> 04:03:02.367
BOARD CERTAIN THE CHARGE MORE

04:03:02.434 --> 04:03:03.869
DEMAND IS IT'S HIDING SUPPLIES

04:03:03.936 --> 04:03:05.637
SCARCE- AND THAT IS A FUNCTION

04:03:05.704 --> 04:03:07.439
OF. PLACE SO. WE CAN WE CAN

04:03:07.506 --> 04:03:08.407
JUST A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES

04:03:08.473 --> 04:03:09.775
ABOUT THE BUT DON'T THINK.

04:03:09.841 --> 04:03:11.410
NECESSARILY PROFITABILITY IN

04:03:11.476 --> 04:03:14.813
OUR SECTOR IS A BAD THING- AND

04:03:14.880 --> 04:03:16.114
CERTAINLY IT ALLOWS US TO

04:03:16.181 --> 04:03:18.317
REINVEST. IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE

04:03:18.383 --> 04:03:21.286
WE NEED TO GROW WE DON'T WANT

04:03:21.353 --> 04:03:22.554
TO NOT BE PROFITABLE FOR

04:03:22.621 --> 04:03:24.589
LOOKING AT HOW DO WE REINVEST

04:03:24.656 --> 04:03:26.959
IN THE TECHNOLOGY WE NEED. IN

04:03:27.025 --> 04:03:28.160
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE

04:03:28.226 --> 04:03:29.394
NEXT GENERATION OF ZERO

04:03:29.461 --> 04:03:30.529
EMISSIONS AND ZERO EMISSIONS

04:03:30.595 --> 04:03:32.564
EQUIPMENT WE NEED- AND THAT

04:03:32.631 --> 04:03:34.266
THAT'S IT THAT'S A CONVERSATION

04:03:34.333 --> 04:03:35.300
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE

04:03:35.367 --> 04:03:38.537
TO HAVE- WITH THE STATE AND-

04:03:38.603 --> 04:03:40.172
WITH EVERYONE MOVING FORWARD.

04:03:40.238 --> 04:03:42.107
AGAIN I AGREE NO ONCE AGAIN TO

04:03:42.174 --> 04:03:43.976
MAKING A PROFIT IT JUST SEEMS

04:03:44.042 --> 04:03:45.510
EXTREME AT THIS POINT I THINK

04:03:45.577 --> 04:03:47.179
AT ALL TIME HIGH MY LAST

04:03:47.245 --> 04:03:48.814
QUESTION IS- WILL THE PORT OF

04:03:48.880 --> 04:03:51.817
LA'S CONTAINER- TWELVE FEES.

04:03:51.883 --> 04:03:53.552
SHORTEN WITH THE TIME THAT YOUR

04:03:53.618 --> 04:03:57.556
MEMBER. COMPANIES LEAVE

04:03:57.622 --> 04:03:58.323
CONTAINERS AT THE PORT. BUT

04:03:58.390 --> 04:04:00.058
THINK THAT'S THAT'S A FAN

04:04:00.125 --> 04:04:02.961
QUESTION- BECAUSE- THE

04:04:03.028 --> 04:04:04.930
IMPOSITION OF THOSE FEES. ARE

04:04:04.997 --> 04:04:06.631
REALLY UNCLEAR WITH RESPECT TO

04:04:06.698 --> 04:04:08.100
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY

04:04:08.166 --> 04:04:10.969
FILTER INTO THE MARKETPLACE-

04:04:11.036 --> 04:04:12.571
BUT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE

04:04:12.637 --> 04:04:15.640
CARGO THAT IS THERE- MOSPORT

04:04:15.707 --> 04:04:17.175
DESTINATION CARGO WHICH MEANS

04:04:17.242 --> 04:04:18.744
ONCE IT'S DELIVERED. IT'S

04:04:18.810 --> 04:04:19.778
ACTUALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY

04:04:19.845 --> 04:04:21.613
CONSONANTAL CARGO OWNER TO COME

04:04:21.680 --> 04:04:22.981
IN A RANGE FOR THE

04:04:23.048 --> 04:04:23.582
TRANSPORTATION TO PICK UP THAT

04:04:23.648 --> 04:04:25.884
CARGO- SO WHETHER OR NOT YO

04:04:25.951 --> 04:04:27.786
IMPOSE A FEE ON. ON A OCEAN

04:04:27.853 --> 04:04:29.621
CARRIER REALLY DOESN'T IMPACT

04:04:29.688 --> 04:04:31.123
THAT CARGO THAT NEEDS TO BE

04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:35.227
ARRANGED- AND- BUT IN GENERAL.

04:04:35.293 --> 04:04:37.529
I THINK AS AN INDUSTRY- SAID I

04:04:37.596 --> 04:04:38.697
THINK OTHER CARRIERS WOULD

04:04:38.764 --> 04:04:41.900
AGREE. THAT AS OU LOOK AT THE

04:04:41.967 --> 04:04:43.268
TENSIONS EMERGE POLICIES

04:04:43.335 --> 04:04:44.970
THEY'RE THEY'RE CRITICAL TO

04:04:45.037 --> 04:04:47.639
KEEPING FLUID IN THE SYSTEM- SO

04:04:47.706 --> 04:04:48.940
IN THE LONG TERM HAVING

04:04:49.007 --> 04:04:50.809
ADDITIONAL FEES ON ON EXCESSIVE

04:04:50.876 --> 04:04:53.078
DWELL SHOULD ACCELERATE. THE

04:04:53.145 --> 04:04:55.280
MOVEMENT OF CARGO I REGARDLESS

04:04:55.347 --> 04:04:56.581
OF WHO THEY ARE IMPOSED ON SO I

04:04:56.648 --> 04:04:58.316
THINK THAT THAT'S MAYES BE SEEN

04:04:58.383 --> 04:04:59.885
ABOUT HOW IT WORKS WITH RESPECT

04:04:59.951 --> 04:05:01.920
INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS INDIVIDUAL

04:05:01.987 --> 04:05:04.389
CARRIERS AT THE SPORTS-

04:05:04.456 --> 04:05:05.290
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE THOUSANDS

04:05:05.357 --> 04:05:07.459
OF DIFFERENT- PERMUTATIONS IN

04:05:07.526 --> 04:05:08.960
THE MARKET PLACE ABOUT HOW.

04:05:09.027 --> 04:05:10.695
THESE CHARGES IN MAY OR MAY NOT

04:05:10.762 --> 04:05:12.731
RELATE TO CONTRACTS. AND BILLS

04:05:12.798 --> 04:05:14.199
OF LADING AND THOSE TYPES OF

04:05:14.266 --> 04:05:16.868
THINGS BUT- MORE COSTS

04:05:16.935 --> 04:05:18.570
ASSOCIATED WITH THE WELL.

04:05:18.637 --> 04:05:23.408

DRIVERS- WHAT WANT TO MAKE VERY

04:07:27.399 --> 04:07:28.300
CLEAR THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE

04:07:28.366 --> 04:07:30.235
THAT THE DRIVER SHORTAGE. IS A

04:07:30.302 --> 04:07:31.937
ROOT CAUSE OF WHAT IS OCCURRING

04:07:32.003 --> 04:07:35.473
WITH FOR CONGESTION- HOWEVER-

BEEN CONSISTENT FOR THE PAST

04:07:48.954 --> 04:07:51.590
SEVERAL YEARS- AND I BELIEVE

04:07:51.656 --> 04:07:53.992
THE NUMBER FOUR OWNER OPERATOR
