A POSTER ALAN [inaudible] CERVANTES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE VERY PROUD TO PRESENT SP FIVE FIVE ONE THIS IS A BILL THAT SEEKS TO PROVIDE. INCREASE ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ACROSS STATE. OUR FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHIEF CONSULTANT OF THE COMMITTEE. I SHE'S DONE JUSTIN AND MASON AMOUNT WORK ON THIS BILL THAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN. PROBABLY MONTHS OF WORK AND REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT SHE'S DONE TO MAKE THIS A A WONDERFUL BILL. WE COULD HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT HER IN FACT I'M THINKING OF ADDING OR TO OUR ARE -- STAFF BUDGET. PRISON IT'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK. YEAH NO WILL GET REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OUR HELP THIS IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL -- TO I GET HURT IT. INCREDIBLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT -- SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE AND THIS THIS PROGRAM THAT WE'VE WORKED ON FOR ACTUALLY YEARS NOW WE WORK THE WORKING ON CAL CAPTAIN THIS IS SO NOT MY FIRST INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CAL CUP PROGRAM WE WE WERE ABLE TO PASS A BILL. NINE EIGHT ONE I THINK IT WAS NUMBER THAT BROUGHT IN ABOUT ONE POINT. NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF SMALL BUSINESS LOANS ACROSS THE STATE. AT A TIME THAT WAS A VERY VERY NEEDED -- SEVERAL YEARS BACK WITH SO. WHEN THE COP AND THE ECONOMY WAS STILL IN REBOUNDS SO -- THIS THIS BILL IS IN OUR RESPONSE -- TO LOT OF A BUSINESS STAKEHOLDERS -- IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THEY THEY HAVE. ALWAYS BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF CALCUTTA IT'S NEVER BEEN -- THEIR FIRST CHOICE FURTHER BANKING NEEDS THERE ARE LOAN NEEDS AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM. BUT ALSO A OF OF A BILL THAT MAKES. THE OX EIGHTEEN CREASES ACCESS TO CAPITAL I THINK THAT'S KEY -- OUT OF EVERY BUSINESS THAT -- GOES OUT TO LOOK FOR A LOAN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONLY 10% ACTUALLY GET IT. THAT LEAVES 90% OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES OUT THERE THAT HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING ACCESS. CHU CHU A VERY IMPORTANT LOANS TO IMPROVE THEIR BUSINESSES TO EXPAND THEIR BUSINESSES AND I THINK THAT'S THE KEY. WE WANT TO GET SMALL BUSINESS TO EXPAND THEIR BUSINESS THERE THEY'VE THEY EMPLOY OVER 90% OF CALIFORNIANS. AND THAT OUR STATE. NEEDS TO DO MORE TO TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE SMALL BUSINESSES SUCCEED IN THE STATE -- SO THIS BILL -- WOULD. WOULD -- ENSURE THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THE COP CAPRA GRAHAM BY TRANSPORTING. TRANSFERRING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM TO THE CALIFORNIA PUT [inaudible] FROM. THE CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL FINANCING AUTHORITY TO THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE AND ARE. WHICH EXISTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FOR STRUCTURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BACK. MAKE IN -- MAKING THESE -- SERVICES EASY TO FIND AS OUR FIRST UP TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE GET ACCESS TO THEM. ITS HARD TO LOOK FOR A LOAN IT TO CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL FINANCING AUTHORITY WHO WHATEVER LOOK THERE FOR A LONG. BUT IT MAKES SENSE THAT -- IF. THE CALIFORNIA HAS A BANKING INSTITUTION ALREADY IN EXISTENCE THAT'S DESIGNED TO PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING. AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT -- LOANS STUDDED BE LOCATED THERE. I FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY FIND EASIER AND TO BE HOUSE UNDER. A STAFF THAT HAS THAT THAT DOCUMENT. A PROPERLY ADMINISTER THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM. LOCATING CULPEPPER UNDER THE AYE BANQUET PROVIDE. THE PROGRAM POSSIBILITIES FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND A PROGRAM STRUCK TRUCK SHOW BE MORE BENEFICIAL. TO ENROLLING LENDERS AND HELPING THEIR SMALL BUSINESS CLIENTS WHILE ALLOWING. THIS THE CPC EFFORT TO FOCUS ON ITS PRIMARY MISSION OF POLLUTION CONTROL. HOW? HOT AGENCY TASKED WITH POLLUTION CONTROL WAS EVER A GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY PROVIDE FINANCING HIS HIS IS BEYOND ME. BUT IT THIS MAKES MORE SENSE AND I HOPE YOU LOOK REAL CONCURRENT HOPE YOU AGREE.

ARE COVER WITH SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT AND LET'S GO AHEAD AND ASK IF WE HAVE ANYBODY WHO IS OPPOSED THAT WOULD LIKE. TO BE ON RECORD. MORNING CLUB WELCOME. THANK YOU CHAIR WOMAN SENATOR HUESO AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M RENEE WEBSTER HAWKINS AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL. FINANCING AUTHORITY AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS LONG SUPPORT OF THE CAL CAP IN OTHER PROGRAMS AT CB CFA. FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS CPC FAA HAS BEEN A NATIONALLY RESPECTED SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN PUBLIC FINANCE. WITH A MISSION TO UNLOCK PRIVATE CAPITAL TO SUPPORT PROJECTS COULD CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO STATE AND LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. YES CPC FAA'S ORIGINS STARTED WITH ISSUING BONDS FOR HARD TO FINANCE ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS TO ACHIEVE LANDFILL DIVERSION AND BROWNFIELDS REMEDIATION. QUICKLY HOWEVER RECOGNIZING THE GREAT EXTENT TO WHICH FAMILY RUN AND OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES FILL THE WASTE MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE CPC A FAKE CREATED AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO REIMBURSE THE SMALL BUSINESSES THE COST OF ISSUANCES TO LOWER THE COST OF DEBT OF FINANCING AND THAT PROGRAM REMAINS VIABLE IN STRONG. TODAY. THE SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE FUND THAT CB CFA NURTURED ALSO BECAME THE SOURCE OF CAL CAP WHICH CP CFA CREATED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AN EXTRA CENTER TO LEND TO SMALL BUSINESSES A POOLED LOSS RESERVE FUND TO CALL UPON SHOULD ANY QUALIFYING LOANS TO SMALL BUSINESSES DEFAULT. THE DESIGN OF CAL CAP AND THEN AND NOW IS INTENTIONALLY SIMPLE. UNLIKE LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE AND THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OFFERS CP CFA DOES NOT UNDERWRITE THE LOANS WE DIFFER A WHOLLY TO THE PARTICIPATING LENDERS. NOR DO WE DIRECT THE PARTICIPATING LENDERS TO OFFER CERTAIN LOAN TERMS. UNLIKE INTEREST BUY DOWN PROGRAMS THERE'S NO NEED FOR LENDERS TO DEFER TO MARKET COMPARISONS TO PRESCRIBE THE INTEREST RATES THEY OFFER. INSTEAD THE CAL CAP PROGRAM MAINTAIN SIMPLE CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING THE ELIGIBILITY OF ELIGIBLE BORROWERS AND THE USES OF LOAN PROCEEDS AND DEFERS TO THE CREDIT POLICIES OF THE PARTICIPATING BANKS. LENDERS SUBMIT A TWO PAGE APPLICATION TO CP CFA TO ENROLL LOANS AND THE COW CAP PROGRAM AND CAN EVEN DO THAT AFTER THE LOAN IS DISBURSED SO THAT THEIR FIRST PRIORITY REMAINS WITH SERVING THEIR SMALL BUSINESS BORROWERS. AND PROVIDING THAT THE CAPITAL THAT THEY NEED. UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION THE CP CFA AND THE LEADERSHIP OF CP CFA HAS FOLLOWED TWIN STARS HIGH CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRUDENT ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC FUNDS. IN EVERY PROGRAM EVERY BUSINESS IT TRANSACTION EVERY DECISION WE REFERENCE THESE EQUALLY IMPORTANT VALUES. SO WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE AND CAL CAP. IT MEANS THAT OUR ANALYSTS HAVE A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LOAN OFFICERS AT EACH OF THE PER CAPITA IS A PAYDAY LENDING INSTITUTIONS. IT MEANS NOT INSERTING OURSELVES UNNECESSARILY BETWEEN THE LENDERS IN THEIR BORROWERS SO THAT THE LENDERS CAN CONTROL THE CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. IT MEANS WORKING INNOVATIVELY WITH THE LENDERS TO ASSIST THEM WITH COMPLEX PORTFOLIO SALES AND ACQUISITIONS. IT MEANS THAT THE STAFF IS READILY AVAILABLE TO DISCUSS NOVEL LENDING SCENARIOS IN A CHANGING ECONOMY WITH THE LENDERS AND HOW ARE SIMPLE RULES APPLIED OF THOSE SCENARIOS. IT ALSO MEANS BEING CONSISTENT OPEN AND TRANSPARENT IN ALL DECISION MAKING AND OPERATIONS OF THE PROGRAM. IT MEANS MAINTAINING THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE PROGRAMS TO WELL BELOW 5% OF OUR ANNUAL PROGRAM EXPENDITURES DESPITE RISING COSTS OF OVERHEAD IN OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. IT ALSO MEANS WALKING A DELICATE TYPE TIGHT ROPE BETWEEN ALLOWING THE PROMISE AND LIGHT TOUCH OF THE CAL CAP PROGRAM TO FLOURISH WHILE KEEPING WATCH TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM DOESN'T UNINTENTIONALLY INCUBATE A PORTFOLIO OF TROUBLED ASSETS. AFTER THE NATIONAL TRAGEDY SPURRED FROM WIDESPREAD SUBPRIME LENDING EVERYONE OF US IN THIS ROOM ARE IT. ARE FOCUSED ON BEING GOOD STEWARDS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT UNWITTINGLY SUBSIDIZING PROGRAMS ENCOURAGE UNWISE LENDING. SO ADMITTEDLY MUCH OF THE REASON WHY I THINK WE ARE HERE IS DUE TO THE MIXED RECEPTION ABOUT CPC FAA'S ADOPTION OF WHAT WE CALL OVER CAPTURE MECHANISM AND CAL CAP FOR SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM. AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT IT IS ON IT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN SHARED OR SUGGESTED TO YOU THAT IT'S HARMFUL. AND THAT IT WAS SPRUNG PERHAPS UPON THE LENDERS THROUGH HASTILY ADOPTED. EMERGENCY REGULATIONS BUT IN FACT [inaudible] WHEN? CBC FAA AS WELL AS THE AYE BANK RECEIVED OUR FEDERAL AS S. B. C. I MONIES WE WERE DIRECTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE MONIES WERE SUSTAINABLE BEYOND THE FIRST EXPENDITURE OF THOSE FUNDS. AND SO TWO YEARS BEFORE OUR RULE MAKING LAST SUMMER WE BEGIN A DIALOGUE WITH THE LENDERS ABOUT THE NEED TO SET SOME KIND OF LOAN -- RULES AND PARAMETERS ON THE LOS RESERVE ACCOUNTS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT AN INCREASE CONTINUED SMALL BUSINESS LENDING LONG AFTER THE FIRST EXPENDITURE THE FEDERAL FUNDS. CB CFA ENCOURAGE DIALOGUE THROUGH MULTIPLE ROUND TABLES INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS WITH LENDERS ANNOUNCEMENTS PRESENTATIONS AT MONTHLY BOARD MEETINGS AND ULTIMATELY A PUBLIC SYMPOSIUM IN APRIL. TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN WHICH THE LENDERS WHO SPOKE ALL SUPPORTED A RECAPTURE MECHANISM TO SUPPORT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM. FOLLOWING THAT SYMPOSIUM THE CFO OF THE NAME SPONSOR OF THIS BILL OFFERED FULL SUPPORT FOR THE RECAPTURE FORMULA THAT WAS WRITTEN INTO S. B. FIVE FIVE ONE IN JUNE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN STATING TO ME DIRECTLY NO ONE CAN CALL THIS UNREASONABLE. ADDITIONALLY HE AND OTHER LENDERS URGED CP CFA TO MOVE WITH PASTE WITH OUR REGULATIONS SO THAT THERE WOULD BE NO BREAK IN THE PROGRAM FOLLOWING THE DEPLETION OF FUNDS. SO INDEED THE IDEA EVERY CAPTURE ON A LOS RESERVE RATHER CREDIT ENHANCEMENT IS NOT NEW. OTHER PUBLICLY FUNDED LOSS RESERVE PROGRAMS INCLUDE MAXIMUM FINE THRESHOLDS RANGING FROM THE NATION. ARE COLLATERAL SUPPORT PROGRAM. WITH A STEP DOWN RECAPTURE OF THE AMOUNT OF CASH COMMENSURATE WITH THE DRAWDOWN OF IN THE PAY OFF THE OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE. THE CAL CAP ATA AND CAL CAP SEISMIC SAFETY PROGRAMS APPROVED AND FUNDED BY THIS LEGISLATURE DIRECTED US TO INCLUDE RECAPTURE FEATURES. AND IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD DIRECT US TO INCORPORATED. MECHANISM AS WELL. SO THE CAL CAP FOR SMALL BUSINESS REMAINS THE ONLY LOSS FOR THE RESERVE PROGRAM THAT WE OPERATE WITHOUT. ONE THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORTED THE RECAPTURE MECHANISM WITH SIX EYES IN JUNE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BECAUSE IT SERVE THOSE TWIN GOALS OF SERVING MORE SMALL BUSINESSES WILL PRUDENTLY MANAGING PUBLIC FUNDS. ALSO IN JUNE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE BOARD OF CP CFA CONVENED A PUBLIC MEETING WITH AN IN DEPTH. PRESENTATION AND DISCUSSION OF HOW IT WOULD WORK INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF AN OPT IN FEATURE TO ALLOW EACH LENDER TO ELECT WHETHER OR NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE RECAPTURE. I ALSO DO WANT TO CORRECT SOME PART OF THE RECORD BEFORE YOU TODAY THE ANALYSIS ANALYSIS THAT WAS PUBLISHED YESTERDAY. SUGGESTS THAT IT WAS BASED ON A PRESENTATION -- AND STATEMENTS MADE AT A JULY. DIED TWENTY SEVENTEEN BOARD MEETING OF CP CFA THAT PERHAPS TRIGGERED THE LENDERS TO BACK AWAY FROM THE JUNE TWENTY SEVENTEEN VERSION OF THE BILL. AND CHANGE COURSE BUT THAT IS NOT QUITE TRUE. THE BILL WAS PULLED FROM THE BANKING COMMITTEE THE WEEK BEFORE THAT CB CFA BOARD MEETING AND AN EMAIL FROM -- THE AUTHORS STAFF TO ME BEFORE THAT BOARD MEETING CONFIRMED THE INTENT. SIDE TO SHIFT GEARS. INDEED THE LENDERS ARE NOT A MONOLITHIC GROUP WE PRIDE OURSELVES IN OFFERING A SIMPLE AND ACCESSIBLE LOAN LOSS RESERVE PROGRAM. ADMITTEDLY IT'S DIFFICULT OFFER A PROGRAM THAT MEETS THE LENDING PORTFOLIOS. SUCH A WIDE VARIETY OF LENDERS FROM SMALL NONPROFIT CDF EYES TO COMMUNITY BANKS TO CORPORATE LENDERS. FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT AT THE TREASURER'S OFFICE WE SEE. THE STRESSES IN THE BANKING AND LENDING IS IN INDUSTRY WE SEE THE 46% REDUCTION IN LENDING INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. WE ALSO SEE ALTERNATIVE FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES ENTER THE ARENA AND APPLAUD THE ADVOCACY TO PUT A LID ON PREDATORY BUSINESS LENDING. WALL AT THE SAME TIME SUPPORTING PUBLIC FINANCING SOLUTIONS THAT MEET THE NEED OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES AND OTHER UNDERSERVED BUSINESSES. AND SO IN THAT TMOSPHERE WE APPRECIATE THAT ANY PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT WE OFFER MAY NOT BE A PERFECT FIT. FOR EVERY LENDERS BUSINESS PLAN BUT NONETHELESS WE'VE ALWAYS REMAINED AN HONEST BROKER AND COMMITTED TO OUR DUAL START DRIVERS OF HIGH CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRUDENT OVERSIGHT. AND WE ALSO APPRECIATE THAT WHILE SOME LENDERS MAY WANT INCREASED FLEXIBILITY OR NEW TOOLS TO MEET THE CHANGING MARKET. AT THE VERY SAME TIME WE'RE TOLD BY LENDERS LOWER AND BE MORE. SO IT IS INDEED A FINE TYPE WROTE THAT WE WERE POCKET WE RESPECT THAT. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM CHANGES THIS LAST YEAR IT IS NOTABLE THAT LENDER CONFIDENCE DOES REMAIN STRONGER THAN EVER AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT RIGHT NOW LOAN ENROLLMENT VOLUME IS UP OVER THIS TIME LAST YEAR. SO ADMITTEDLY IN ADDRESSING YOU THIS MORNING TRYING TO FIND OUT THE REAL REASON FOR MOVING THE PROGRAM. WHICH IS SUCCESSFUL BY EVERY MEASURE AWAY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT GAVE BIRTH TO IT AND RAISED IT. HAS FELT A LITTLE BIT LIKE PUNCHING A PILLOW THE RATIONALE HAS CHANGED FROM CONVERSATION TO CONVERSATION AND FROM DAY TO DAY. SO WITH THAT I WOULD DO REMAIN PRESENT TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE I WOULD LIKE IDENTITY TREASURER STEVE WHEREAS TO ALSO HAVE SOME COMMENT SINK. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIRWOMAN AND TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND SENATOR HUESO IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE MY NAME IS STEVE WHERE AS I'M THE CHIEF DEPUTY TREASURER FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE I'M HERE TO REPRESENT. A STATE TREASURER JOHN CHUNG I ALSO CAN AND CONVEY THE OPPOSITION OF CONTROLLER BETTY MUST GOT LOST IN TRANSIT BUT THEY'VE INDICATED TO US THAT THEY ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- I'M HERE IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE I CHAIR THE CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL FINANCE AUTHORITY ON BEHALF OF THE TREASURE AND SO I KNOW. A LITTLE BIT TO INTIMATELY HOW HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS -- WE'VE RD SHARE WITH COMMITTEE I THINK A TREMENDOUS SUCCESSES THAT -- THAT WE'VE WITNESSED OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF THE PROGRAM -- IN FACT SINCE THAT TREASURE TOOK OFFICE IN NINETEEN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE SEEN A METEORIC RISE IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE SIR. I THINK THAT WAS SOMEWHAT EVIDENT IN THE INFORMATION THAT YOU RECEIVE FROM THE PROPONENTS. OF THAT FACT IS CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM THE QUESTION WHETHER THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE CASE BUT AS RENEE JUST SAID IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN AN INCREASE. IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS SO YOU'RE BASICALLY LOOK AT A PROGRAM THAT NOT ONLY SUCCESSFUL IN DOING OUTREACH. BUT IN PARTICULAR DOING OUTREACH TO LEVERAGE PRIVATE DOLLARS WHEN WE ENTERED OFFICE. THE A LEVERAGE RATIO IS. SIX ONE IT'S NOW 1-821- THAT MEANS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE PUT IN A LOAN LOSS RESERVE. EIGHTEEN DOLLARS OF PRIVATE ACTIVITY ARE TAKING PLACE OUT IN THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT I THINK THAT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE. UP I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT WE HAVE A VERY EXTENSIVE OUTREACH TO THOSE WHO HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN UNDER SIR. AND THAT INCLUDES BOTH THE IN AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES THAT WE NEED TO HAVE TRADITIONALLY HAD A HARD TIME WITH ACCESS TO CAPITAL. THEY NOW RECEIVE 61% OF THE LOANS THAT ARE MADE TO THE CAL CAP PROGRAM I THINK ANOTHER REMARKABLE STEP. SO WITH ALL THAT SAID YOU MIGHT ASK WHAT WOULD WE DOING HERE TODAY WHY ARE WE PROPOSING TO TAKE THIS PROGRAM AWAY. FROM A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND HANDED OVER TO ANOTHER STATE AGENCY. WELL AS RENEE HAS SUGGESTED IT BOILS DOWN TO ONE THING. THE RECAP YOUR PROVISION WHICH WE ADOPTED AS SUPPORT LAST YEAR ON THAT BOARD INCLUDES BOTH THE TREASURE CONTROLLER. AND DIRECTOR FINANCE WILL VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO ADOPT THAT PROVISION WHAT THAT PROVISION DOES IS IT SAYS. BUT I LENDERS IF YOU HAVE IDLE FUNDS THAT WE PROVIDE YOU THE CAL KEPT PROGRAM THAT YOU ARE NOT MAKING LOANS WITH. THAT MONEY SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THE STATE RETURN TO SEE BEEFY CFA SO THAT WE CAN FUND. MORE BUSINESSES AND THAT'S IN FACT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING -- AND IN FACT WE'VE GOTTEN COMPLY. WHO BOUGHT IT OUT? YOU KNOW THAT WE WE PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WE THINK. THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO RUN A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM YOU SHOULD PUT THAT MONEY TO WORK IT SHOULDN'T BE USED -- BY MANY OF THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL TO BASICALLY PAD THEIR THEIR ASSET SHEETS THAT'S JUST NOT WHAT THE PROGRAM WAS INTENDED TO DO. IS NOT IN THE SPIRIT OF SMALL BUSINESS. SO I IMPLORE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT THAT IN FACT THAT'S THE WHOLE PURPOSE FOR WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. AND A WHAT IT SEEMS TO BE IS JUST A BRAZEN ATTEMPT. TO CHERRY PICK WHICH STATE AGENCY ARE WE GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH. THAT TENDS TO BE THE LENDERS CREDO AND IF. FOR IT WE WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE THAT WE SHOULD ALLOW A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE TO GO AND PICK THEIR OWN STATUS. I HAPPEN TO SIT ON THE AYE BACK ON BEHALF OF THE TREASURE AND I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE IBEX STAFF BUT I CAN I CAN ASSURE YOU. THAT AT LEAST FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THEY WILL NOT RUN THIS PROGRAM AS EFFICIENTLY AS AS THE CAL CAP PROGRAM THAT'S ADMINISTERED. BY CPC IF THEY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OR THAT EXPERIENCE IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA OF LOAN LOSS RESERVE SO. AGAIN I ASK THAT -- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE OPEN THIS UP FOR AN INTERIM HEARING I THINK THAT'S A PERFECT SETTING TO TRY TO ADDRESS. WHAT THE ISSUES ARE HERE I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA FIND AT ALL ON THIS BILL? SO WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDING IF HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU MEMBERS DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. ALRIGHT WITH THAT DO WE HAVE ANYBODY ELSE WHO OWN I'M SORRY WHAT IF THERE'S ANYBODY ELSE IN OPPOSITION THAT MORNING HERE FROM YEAH YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANY ANYBODY ELSE WHO IS OPPOSED. IF YOU ARE PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND GOOD MORNING WE'RE JUST GONNA STATE ARE NAMED ORGANIZATION MY NAME IS SHARON EVANS CURRENT MEMBER BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. A MEMBER OF THE MILKEN INSTITUTE. ON STEERING COMMITTEE FOR MINORITY CAPITAL ACCESS AND I CHAIR THE HEALTH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MINORITY BUSINESS ALLIANCE. AND YOUR POST I AM A POST OKAY THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU MISTER MORRIS. AND WOOD I PUT THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS WILL GO AHEAD AND TAKE THOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SO I THOUGHT -- AND I'VE A IMMENSE AMOUNT OF RESPECT -- FOR CENTER HUESO MAYBE NOT YOUR PUNCTUALITY THIS MORNING BUT BUT DEFINITELY FOR THE SENDER -- BUT ALSO -- FOR YOU KNOW TREASURE -- CHUNG IN CONTROLLER YE -- AND THERE SEEMS TO BE A REAL DIVIDE AS TO WHY WE'RE DOING THIS AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PROGRAM. IN THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO LAND TO SO -- I GUESS ONE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS IT YOU KNOW IF. IF THE FRUSTRATION SEEMS TO BE AROUND THIS RECAPTURE THE UP POLICY. BUT THERE EEDS TO BE AWAY THEM DIDN'T TAKE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE PROGRAM BE SUSTAINABLE WHICH I THINK THAT WAS MEANT TO ADDRESS WHAT ARE THE PLANS YOU KNOW REMOVE THIS FROM FROM THE OTHER KERN AGENCY. TO TO GOBIZ WHAT'S GOBIZ GONNA DO DIFFERENTLY TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAINTAIN THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM IF THEY'RE PLANNING ON ROLLING BACK THE IDEA OF RECAPTURE [inaudible] WELL. IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE AYE BACK THE AYE BACK ALSO HAS A VERY ILLUSTRIOUS HISTORY. OF OF GATHERING FUNDS OF DISBURSING FUNDS MAKING LOANS OF MANAGING A VERY VERY LARGE PORTFOLIO -- THEY ARE -- WORKING WITHIN THE GOBIZ DEPARTMENT WHICH I BELIEVE IS WITHIN ITSELF THE GLOBALIST ABOUT PARTNER WAS PUT TOGETHER. ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO UNDER PROGRAM THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN IT TRYING TO CREATE A VERY COMPETITIVE. A BUSINESS AGENCY HERE IN THE STATEWILL THAT WILL FOCUS ON BUSINESS EXPANSION A RETENTION. SO WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF WHAT WE ESTABLISH FOR GOLD IS SO I MEAN. IF YOU LOOK AT THE GLOBUS PROGRAM AND WHAT. WHAT THE POWERS THE LEGISLATURE GAVE TO GO BASE TO TO BUSINESS EXPANSION OR RICK RETENTION IN THE? I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS ANOTHER STATE. IN THE COUNTRY THAT HOUSE THAT PORTFOLIO THAT WE PROVIDED GULBIS TO DO. A TAX CREDITS -- BUSINESS SUPPORT SERVICES JUST THE WHOLE ARRAY OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY HERE. THAT ASSISTING PEOPLE THAT STRAINING CALIFORNIA MOVING TO CALIFORNIA AND THRIVING IN CALIFORNIA. THEY HAVE A FOOTPRINT THAT'S ACROSS THE STATE. AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO PENETRATE ALL PARTS OF THE STATE EQUALLY. AN EQUALLY PROVIDE INCENTIVES ACROSS THE STATE. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE CRITICISMS THAT HAS HAS COME OUT OF THIS I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS. THE UN IT ON EVEN. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS ACROSS THE STATE OF CO CAP. CAL KEPT WHICH WILL WAS SUPPOSED TO REACH EVERY PART OF THE STATE. AND I'M VERY CRITICAL AT HOW -- THOSE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED TO BUSINESSES THEY WERE. THERE THEIR ENORMOUS -- EMPTIED A AREAS OR DEATH OR OR OR FINANCE DESERT'S ACROSS THE STATE ONE OF THEM IS MY DISTRICT. CAL CAP -- HAD ZERO TO KNOW A LOANS IN MY DISTRICT AND AND I ACTUALLY WORKED VERY HARD TO WORK WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN MY DISTRICT. THE LENDERS IN MY DISTRICT THE MEDIA IN MY DISTRICT TO GET THIS PROGRAM -- PROMOTED AND YET NO LOW LOANS WERE MADE AND BUT I THINK THAT THAT YOU KNOW. LOOK THE THE I AM NOT I'M NOT HERE TO DISPARAGE ANYBODY I'M JUST SAYING AS A LEGISLATURE WE CAN. WE WE CAN -- WORK WITH OUR STATE LIFT STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY IN THE PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPERTS IN. IN AND WANTED PARTICIPANTS PROGRAM I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING LENDERS IN MY COMMUNITY. TO A PARTICIPANT PROGRAM A LOT OFTHEM HAD NOT EVEN HEARD OF IT AND I UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW THE THEY CP. THE CBC FAA. HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AND IN CERTAIN AREAS AND THEY HAVE AND THEY HAVE A GREAT STAFF AND THEY HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM BUT IT CAN BE DONE BETTER. AND IT CAN BE PUT IN WITH AN APARTMENT THAT IS FOCUSED. ON PROVIDING THE SERVICES -- WITH TWO PEOPLE THAT HAVE CONTACT WITH EVERYDAY. AND I THINK THAT THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM SUSTAINABLE. IT HAS NOT BEEN -- IT IN THAT REGARD I MEAN WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING MONEY INTO THIS PROGRAM AND IT SHOULD BE AT THOSE FUNDS SHOULD NOT ONLY REGENERATE BUT GROW. AND THAT IS MY HOPE AND DOING THIS AND AGAIN I'M WORKING WITH A LARGER STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY UNDERSTAND DEPARTMENT SUPPOSED. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LARGER STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY THERE IN SUPPORT IN THIS NOT JUST LENDING INSTITUTIONS. IT'S A CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE IT'S A BUSINESSES THEMSELVES -- IT'S IT'S BEEN INCLUDES LENDING INSTITUTIONS WITHOUT THEM WE CAN NOT DIMINISH AKAKA. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE THE THAT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE RESOURCES AND THE EXPERTISE TO ISSUE THESE LOANS. WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE STATE OF COURSE BUT THEY ARE OUT THERE IF WE CAN GET THEM TO PARTICIPATE. THIS MONEY WILL NOT FLOW EQUALLY ACROSS THE STATE WHICH IS WHAT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE SHOULD BE EQUITABLE ACCESS FOR ALL PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA EVERY SINGLE COUNTY. IN EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU YOU CANNOT SORRY CHEN JUST TO FOLLOW UP -- TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO REPLY IN A SECOND BUT I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF WE CHANGE IT. DO YOU KNOW FOR TRANSFER TO A DIFFERENT AGENCY WHAT IS THAT AGENCY GONNA DO DIFFERENTLY TO MAINTAIN ITS SUSTAINABILITY -- ME SPECIFICALLY IF THEY'RE NO LONGER NEEDED AND IF THEY'RE NO LONGER GOING TO BE UTILIZING RECAPTURE POLICY. WHAT? WHAT'S THE PLAN AND HOW YOU KNOW BY. I COULD SPEAK TO THAT AS A BAKER EAT DO YOU LIKE WHAT I'M TRYING TO MIKE UP A LITTLE CLOSE LIKE THAT SHE'S MAD AT ME TO BUT IT. A RECAPTURE SEEMS TO BE THE BIG ISSUE HERE AND OBVIOUSLY SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM. I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE THAT I BANKER BANKERS I THINK LIKE BANKERS THEY UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS THEN UNDERSTAND FORECASTING. THEY UNDERSTAND RESERVES THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE LOSSES THAT BANKS TAKEN THE PORTFOLIOS. FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS ON A REALLY NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT THEY COULD BE IN A DOWN CYCLE JUST TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SO THAT THE ARBITRARY. LEVEL OF RESERVES THAT WAS DICTATED WITH THE RECENT LEGISLATION -- WAS THAT IT JUST SET ARBITRARY THAT PICKED A NUMBER 10% SHOULD BE ALL YOU NEED. WELL WHEN YOU'RE MAKING LOS TOMORROW TO MARGINAL BORROWERS YOU TO BE READY FOR THAT DOWN CYCLONE ECONOMY HAS A BANK. I HAVE TO PROVE TO MY REGULATORS THAT I'M READY FOR THAT THAT I'VE FACTORED IN FACT THERE'S A WHOLE NEW -- ACCOUNTING INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR THE BANKS TO CALCULATE THE RESERVES NOT BASED ON THE OLD WAY. BASED ON LIFE OF THE LOAN INCLUDING THE LIKELIHOOD OF A DOWN ECONOMY. SO I CANNOT SAY CATEGORICALLY THAT THE ARBITRARY 10% LEVEL OF RESERVES THAT WAS STATED TO BE OF OF APPROPRIATE INSUFFICIENT IN THIS LEGISLATION. IS IN FACT A GOOD NUMBER NUMBER. ONE SO WHEN YOU SAY WELL WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO BE BETTER AT IBEC I JUST THINK THAT THEY'RE BANKERS THEY UNDERSTAND THE BIG PICTURE OF WHAT LENDERS ARE UP AGAINST. IN TERMS OF WHAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT'S A WRITER'S RESERVE MAN HOW DO YOU GET THERE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DID. AT MY BANK AND I THINK I'M PRETTY MUCH THE TARGET OF THE STATEMENT. THAT WE HAVE VITAL RESERVES THAT WERE JUST HOLDING ON TO THEY DON'T SHOW UP ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. I CREATED THE IDLE RESERVES BY DOING PRUDENT LENDING NOT TAKING LOSSES DURING A LOT OF LOANS. AND I DID IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO HAVE A I KNEW THEIR AGENCY WAS RUNNING OUT OF FUNDS EIGHT YEARS AGO EVERYBODY KNEW. THE FUNDS WERE GOING TO RUN OUT. THEN THIS S. B. C. I'M WHEN HE SHOWED UP. WE SAID WE STILL KNEW THAT IT WOULD RUN OUT IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR BUT YOU KNOW WE KNEW WAS COMING WE ALSO KNEW THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS HAD TO BE SPENT. OR THEY WOULD LOSE IT HAVE TO GIVE IT BACK TO THE US TREASURY. SO THEY CREATED A MECHANISM TO GRAB THAT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS RATHER THAN TO GIVE IT BACK THEY PUT IT IN THE COLLATERAL ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM WHERE IT STILL IS. THAT PROGRAM DOESN'T LEVERAGE FUNDS. ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT THE CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM GOES. THE US TREASURY STUDY OF A COUPLE YEARS AGO SAID THE CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAMS LEVERAGE YOUR PUBLIC FUNDS THE MOST OF ANY PROGRAM AND A BANK LENDER DOES IT PRUDENTLY AND DOESN'T TAKE LOSSES THAT COULD BE PERPETUAL. THAT'S WHAT I INTENDED WHEN I KNEW. THAT THE FUNDS WERE GOING TO RUN OUT A CREATED SURPLUS RESERVES AND I VOLUNTEERED TO THE DIRECTOR THAT WE WOULD BE WILLING TO MAKE LOANS WITH NO CONTRIBUTION TO RESERVES. IF WE WERE ALLOWED TO USE OUR RESERVE POOL THE WAY WE WANTED. TO I HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS FOR TWO YEARS AND EVERYTHING I SAID PRETTY MUCH I COULD NOT COME. A RESPONSE HERE BUT WE APPRECIATE THIS AND I DO WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY THIS IS DOUBLE REFERRED TO BANKING AND SO WILL HAVE THAT INPUT AS WELL THINK FUTURE WOMAN I I'LL TRY TO BE AS BRIEF AS I CAN'T -- LET ME FIRST GO TO THE ISSUE OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. BOB YOU HAVE RECOGNIZING GO BACK TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS PUNCTURED. PRIMARILY BY THE LEADING INTRIGUED BY CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION SO THEY WANT TO DICTATE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN I CAN ASSURE YOU BECAUSE I CHECKED. BUT NO ONE IT AT GOBIZ OR THE AYE BANK HAVE INDICATED ANY INTEREST IN TAKING THIS PROGRAM OVER. SO LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT YOU'RE GONNA GIVE THEM A PROGRAM FOR WHICH THEY HAVE NOT INDICATED ANY INTEREST I'M TO GOAD SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE IS MORE THAN LIKELY THEY'RE GOING TO GET HEAVILY LOBBIED. TO DROP TO RECAPTURE PROVISION SO THAN FACT THE LANDERS CAN CONTINUE TO KEEP THAT MONEY IN AND WITH REGARDLESS OF MISREPRESENTATION. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WOULD LOVE TO DO IS KEEP THAT MONEY AND BASICALLY HOLD IT FOR HIMSELF EVEN THOUGH HE BE ISN'T USING IT IF HE WANTS TO MAKE NEW LOANS THAT'S GREAT. BUT I'M JUST SAYING WHY WOULD WE OPEN THAT BACK INTO. I MEAN WHICH WE'VE ACTUALLY ADDED TO OUR ROSTER. SINCE WE DON RECAPTURE WE HAVE NEW LENDERS. AND SO AGAIN IT'S I THINK THIS THIS BOILS DOWN TO THIS ONE ISSUE. IS THAT WHERE IS RECAPTURING GOING TO END UP AND WHO'S GOING TO ENFORCE IT AND IF. IF -- AGAIN UP FOR THE LIMITED TIME THAT I'LL BE ON THE AYE BANK WORK I WOULD CERTAINLY. PUSH THEM IF THEY WERE TO GET THIS PROGRAM. TO CONTINUE TO HOLD THE LENDERS FEET TO THE FIRE BUT AGAIN THAT'LL BE A DECISION PRIDE WELL BEYOND THE TIME. THAT I'M SERVING ON THE BOARD THE THANK YOU AND UP AS MY MEMBER STEINORTH. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN COVERED A LOT OF MY COMMENTS BUT I'M JUST IT'S INTERESTING THAT SMALL BUSINESS DAY AND WE ALL KNOW AS AS SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING A SMALL BUSINESSMAN FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AT THE SINGLE GREATEST PROBLEMS. FOR SMALL BUSINESSES UNDER CAPITALIZATION. JUST POINT LIKE THAT IS THE SINGLE GREATEST REASON FOR BUSINESS TO FAIL YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST PRODUCT HAVE AN ABSOLUTELY OPEN MARKET BUT WITHOUT THE PROPER CAPITALIZATION YOU CANNOT GET YOUR PRODUCT TO MARKET. OR TO THE MEET THE NEEDS OF THE MARKET AND ULTIMATELY YOU WILL FAIL SO MY QUESTION IS IS IT'S IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I I WAS SERVING A BMP FOR A LONG TIME IN THIS REALLY REMINDS ME A LOT OF US GOT THE PRACTICE ISSUE. WHERE YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT IT OR KIND OF SCRATCHING HEADS GOING OKAY WHAT WE'VE GOTTA A GOOD AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE GET TO THE WHITE RIGHT RECIPIENTS AND WE'RE LOOKING WILL WHAT'S THE BEST VEHICLE? TO BRING THOSE DOLLARS TO THOSE RISK SO MY QUESTION WOULD I WOULD LIKE EFFECTIVE INVOLVED ON THE REPRESENT FROM THE BANKERS TO JOIN US AS WELL THE ANSWER -- I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE RECAPTURE PART THAT IS THAT IS UNIQUE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY DOLLAR IS BEING UTILIZED APPROPRIATELY AND IT'S NOT SITTING ON A LEDGER SEEDS SHEET SOMEWHERE. AND LET'S IT'S ON THE SMALL BUSINESS PERSON STE LEDGER SHEET WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM CREATE JOBS TO MIGRATE QUESTION IS -- YOU KNOW JUST A BLANKET STATEMENT WHO WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MOST AMOUNT OF FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE MOST TIMELY MANNER. MAY I RESPOND TO FARMERS THINKING. SO OPPORTUNITY FUND IS A SMALL BUSINESS UNDER WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS ADMINS AND LET OUT OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AROUND THE STATE TO TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE P. CFA FOR TWO YEARS TO TRY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE AND IT IT REALLY GOES FAR BEYOND RECAPTURE. AND FOR EXAMPLE AFTER THE RECAPTURE PROVISIONS AND THEY THEN PASSED REGULATIONS TO CHANGE THE RULES ABOUT HOW WE COULD RESTRUCTURE LOANS AND GREATLY LIMITING. RESTRUCTURING BASICALLY MEANS IF A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IS HAVING A HARD TIME PAYING BACK ALONE WE CAN GIVE THEM MORE TIME. AND TO PAY BACK BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT WE WANT TO GET PAID BACK SO THE BUSINESS OWNER CAN THRIVE AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DIP INTO RESERVES. AND THESE REGULATIONS DESPITE LOTS OF WONDER OPPOSITION REALLY RESTRICTED OUR ABILITY TO RESTRUCTURE OUR LOANS AND SO THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RECAPTURE -- BUT IT'S IT'S AN INDICATION TO ME OF THAT OF THE FACT THAT. I AM I BEING MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDS. AND THE NEEDS OF LENDERS AND THEREFORE SMALL BUSINESS SAYS THAT CP CFA AND IN FACT. TO THAT TO THAT -- SUGGESTION THAT AND I THINK ISN'T READY TO TAKE THIS ON A NUMBER OF THE STAFF FROM CP CFA ACTUALLY LAUGHED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. AND MOVED OVER THERE SO THE EXPERTISE AND AND LASTLY I WOULD JUST SAY THAT AND A GRAPHIC WITH IT YESTERDAY RELEASED BY HAVE THE TREASURER'S OFFICE KIND OF SHOWING HOW THIS PROGRAM WORKS AND HOW THAT. STATE MONEY COMES AND GOES TO THE SMALL BUSINESS THERE'S A FACT SHEET THE CAME OUT YESTERDAY. AND REALLY INTERESTINGLY IT COMPLETELY IGNORES THE FACT THAT LENDERS ALSO PUT IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AT THE STATE THE LENDERS ARE NOWHERE IN THE PICTURE EXCEPT AS RECIPIENTS OF THE FUNDS -- AND SO WHAT WE NEED IS AND AN AGENCY THAT UNDERSTANDS LENDING. AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE PARTNERS IN THIS THAT WE ARE NOT I'M LOOKING FOR A HANDOUT RATHER THAN WE CAPTURE WHAT THE BILL ORIGINALLY HAD AND IT WAS SOMETHING WHERE EACH LENDER COULD USE THEIR POOL. IF THERE WAS NO MORE STATE MONEY THEY COULD USE THEIR POOL TO KEEP AND ROLLING AROUND SO WERE ALL FOR USING THAT MONEY TO THE BEST USE POSSIBLE. THE IDEA OF CHANGING THE RULES AFTER THE FACT ON LENDERS AND AND CHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME IS WHAT I THINK WE ALL ARE QUITE OPPOSED. TO SELLING IN CONCLUSION. YOU CAN SEE FROM THOSE WHO ARE SUPPORTIVE AND WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE DONE ALL WE CAN TO WORK WITH THIS AGENCY AND WE BELIEVE I THINK IT'S TRULY THAT THE EXPERT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALRIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. WE JUST LOST MISTER [inaudible] YOU. I IN FACT IN DATA IN TERMS OF COMMUNITIES THIS BILL I WE ALREADY HAD TO OPPOSITION SPOKE SPOKE FAIRLY. LENGTHY AND SO WHAT WE TYPICALLY DAVE DO IS JUST HAVE YOUR WAY AND THANK YOU. UP ALRIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS -- SENATOR HUESO DO YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING REMARKS. I SIMPLY -- THIS IS BEEN A GREAT DISCUSSION I THINK I ROOTED OUT ALL THE ISSUES -- REGARDED REGARDING THIS THIS MATTER -- BUT I ALSO IN TERMS OF THE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE AYE AYE. WHILE THE AYE BACK BECAUSE IT TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS BILL THEY HAVE -- COLLABORATED AND AND CREATING LANGUAGE SO. IF IT DOES END UP ARE ON THEIR DOORSTEP THEY WILL THEY WILL BE IT THIS BILL IS READY FOR THEM IMPLEMENT. IMMEDIATELY WHAT THEN ARE HOW THEY OPERATE -- YOU KNOW THIS BILL IS ABOUT -- AGAIN CONTINUING OUR EFFORTS TO TO MAKE CALIFORNIA COMPETITOR STATE CRANE DEPARTMENT THAT OFFERS ALL THE TOOLS AND TOOL BELT. NECESSARY TO DO THAT WORK FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. AND TO PROVIDE THE MOST YOU USER FRIENDLY SYSTEM. IN A MANNER THAT MAKES SENSE IN AT WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION THAT'S FULLY EQUIPPED. CHIU TO PROVIDE -- BANKING. OR DO LENDING. NEEDS TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THAT I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR AND BEFORE WE CALL FOR A VOTE I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS. UP A FEW OF YOU WHO HAVE WATCHED THESE HEARINGS THAT I HAVE RUN I ALWAYS LIKE TO BRING IT BACK TO THE PEOPLE. BIOS LIKE TO BRING IT TO US WHETHER IT IS THAT TO A YOUNG BUSINESS OWNER WHO IS JUST THINKING OR DREAMING ABOUT STARTING A BUSINESS WHETHER IT SOMEBODY WHO HAS RETIRED AND NOW WANTS TO START A BUSINESS. AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHERE DO I START AND YOU KNOW. IT DEPENDING ON THE TIME PERIOD MAYBE A HANDFUL OF YEARS AGO THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO THEIR CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THEY MIGHT HAVE GOT LOOKED UP. A ON GOOGLE SOMETHING ABOUT STARTING A BUSINESS AND A VARIOUS -- INFORMATION WOULD POP AS WE'VE GONE INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE AS A STATE OF BEEN PROMOTING HIS GOBIZ IT'S A ONE STOP SHOP. AND WHEN YOU HEAR GOBIZ AND A WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS TRYING TO GET AN APP FOR IT TRYING TO MAKE IT A USER FRIENDLY WHETHER THE ON A MOBILE DEVICE AYE EVEN RECENTLY ON ON THE THE US ASSEMBLY STATE FLOOR. A BILL MOVE FORWARD WHICH IS HOW A REBRANDING CALIFORNIA WHAT ARE STATES PRIORITY SO THAT WE CAN BE THE VOICE OF A REALLY AYE DEFINING WHAT CALIFORNIA IS AS A BUSINESS. ECONOMIC -- POWER HOUSE SO WHEN I JUST THINK OF THAT PERSON WHO KNOWS. ZERO ABOUT HELP CAP OR A OR B. OR ANY OF THE ACRONYMS THAT WE ALL KNOW AND CAN FIRSTHAND SAY BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE WEEDS UP HERE THAT MEANS WE KNOW -- ALL KINDS OF AGENCIES WE CAN SPEAK TO BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T TO ME WHAT MAKES SENSE ABOUT THIS IS YES WE HAVE THE RECAPTURE ISSUE WE HAVE OTHER ISSUES THAT WILL BE REFERRED. TO BANKING BUT THE BIGGEST THING IS HOW DOES THE AVERAGE PERSON WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY BAY -- ANY BACKGROUND AND JUST WANTS TO START WEARS WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO THINK WHEN THEY'RE WANTING TO START A BUSINESS DO I GO TO THE POLLUTION. OF OR DO I GO TO A BILL BIDS AND SO THAT'S REALLY FOR ME WHAT DRIVES ME TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE TO GET THE ACCESS. THAT WE KNOW THEY NEED AND I WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO START THAT -- DREAM THAT THEY HAVE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES EMBEDDED AND I CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT THE TREASURER'S OFFICE -- TO TIM TO LEAVE HERE FEELING LIKE THERE IS IN A WAY TO CONTINUE PARTNERING AND AS MISTER MORRIS SAID YOU KNOW HE IS ON BOTH SO I KNOW YOU HAVE THE LENDS FROM FOR BOTH.
