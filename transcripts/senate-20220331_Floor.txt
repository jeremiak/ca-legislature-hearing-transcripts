THROUGH COUNTLESS STRIKES BOYCOTTS MARCHES AND FASS SAYS THAT CHÁVEZ SUCCESSFULLY INCREASED PUBLIC AWARENESS OF FARMWORKER CONDITIONS. BUT THESE ARE NOT JUST STRUGGLES OF THE PAST.

TRANSFERABLE ESPECIALLY BLACK AND LET NEXT TRANS PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE KILLED ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND HORRIFYING NUMBERS. AND A NUMBER OF STATES WERE SEEN BLATANT AWFUL ATTACKS BEING WAGED AGAINST OUR LGBTQ SIBLINGS IN YOUTH. PARENTS WHO LOVE AND SUPPORT THEIR TRANS CHILDREN UNCONDITIONALLY ARE BEING ACCUSED OF CHILD ABUSE. AND IN NEARLY A DOZEN STATES TRANS ATHLETES ARE BEING BANNED FROM SPORTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR GENDER IDENTITY. THIS WON'T BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN AND WE WON'T LET THIS GO ON ANSWERED. NOT ON OUR WATCH AND NOT IN OUR STATE. VITRIOL AND VICIOUS ATTACKS WON'T BE TOLERATED IN CALIFORNIA. AND TO MY TRANS SIBLINGS I SAY. AS ARE.

MY MOTHER WAS A GOOD WOMAN OF FAITH AND SHE BELIEVED SINCERELY IN NOT JUDGING OTHERS AND THAT ALLOWED HER TO LOVE AND TO BE THE BEST MOM. TO ME AND MY SIBLINGS. THE COLLEAGUES WITH THAT% UNDERSTANDING IN MY LIFE IN MY HEART I URGE YOU TO STEP OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE MORE. AND TO SUPPORT ACR ONE SIXTY ONE. THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM CENTER WIENER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER PRESIDENT AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FROM. FROM STOCKTON AND ALSO MADAM PER TIME AFTER THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL REMARKS- SHOWING ONCE AGAIN THAT- WE LOVE OUR ALLIES BUT HAVING. A SEAT AT THE TABLE- MATTERS MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD- I RISE TODAY BOTH AS VICE CHAIR OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS AND ALSO AS A GAY MAN IN SUPPORT OF ACR ON ONE SIXTY ONE- YOU KNOW KOHLI SAID AYE AYE WITH ALL THE CULTURE WARS. THAT ARE HAPPENING TODAY AND IT'S REALLY I JUST HAVE TO SAY. THAT THE IDEA THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE TRYING TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS. POSITION THEMSELVES TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT SCORING POLITICAL POINTS THAN ADVANCING THEIR OWN POLITICAL CAREERS ON THE BACKS OF CHILDREN THIS IN THE- RECENT SUPREME COURT HEARINGS WHERE YOU HAD US SENATORS WHO WERE OUT WHO ALL WANT TO BE PRESIDENT. WHO WERE SCRAMBLING AT THE OPPORTUNITY. TO ATTACK TRANSFERABLE. TO THE ATTACK LEAH THOMAS. UNITED TRANS WOMAN WHO ACTUALLY ONE. A SWIMMING CHAMPIONSHIP AND INSTEAD OF BEING CELEBRATED FOR HER ATHLETIC PROWESS. WAS COMPLETELY SAVAGED CAN YOU IMAGINE YOU'RE A YOUNG PERSON YOU YOU YOU ACHIEVE THIS GOAL AND YOU'RE ATTACKING TOLD THE YOU'RE A SCAM ARTIST. AND A FRAUD. NO ONE TALKS ABOUT ALL OF THE- TIMES WHEN AS A CISGENDER WOMAN DEFEATS A TRANS WOMAN IN AN IN A SPORTS COMPETITION THAT HAPPENS A LOT. WITH THE SYSTEM THE WOMAN WINS TRANSCONTINENTAL'S KNOWN TALKS ABOUT THAT BUT GOD FOR BID A TRANS WOMAN ACTUALLY WINS SOMETIMES. IT'S NOT AN ACTUAL VICTORY IT'S NOW A SCAM OR A FRAUD. AND WE SEE POLITICIANS WHO ARE. POURING FUEL ON THAT FIRE. AND IT'S JUST IT'S JUST DESPICABLE. AND THEN WE SEE THESE TRENDS KIDS WHOSE. UNIVERSE SO MANY TRANS KIDS AN LGBTQ KIDS WHO WERE REJECTED BY THEIR FAMILIES AND THAT'S WHY THE RATES OF SUICIDE AMONG LGBT KIDS IS SO HIGH. THAT'S WHY I'M ABOUT HALF ABOUT HALF OF HOMELESS YOUTH IDENTIFY AS LGBTQ REPRESENTED IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. THIS ISN'T A RANDOM. IT'S BECAUSE OF REJECTION OFTEN BY THE FAMILY. AND SO IMAGINE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY YOU ACTUALLY EMBRACES THEIR TRANS CHILD AND SUPPORTS THAT CHILD AND LOVES THAT CHILD. AND MAKE SURE THAT CHILD HAS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WE NOW HAVE STATES SAYING YOU'RE A CRIMINAL. WE'RE GONNA PUT THE PARENT AND IMPRISONED IN IDAHO THEY WERE PROPOSING LIFE IN PRISON FOR A PARENT WHO ALLOWS OUR TRANSCRIPT HAVE HEALTH CARE. AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE KID ON PUT THE CAN IN FOSTER CARE. HE MAGIC IF YOU'RE A CHILD MANAGING OF ANY OF US. WHEN WE WERE SIX OR EIGHT OR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS OLD I GOT A SIGNAL BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE. YOUR PARENTS ARE GOING TO PRISON AND YOU'RE GOING ON THE FOSTER CARE. THAT'S A SIGNAL THE POLITICIANS IN THIS COUNTRY. ARE SENDING TO THESE CHILDREN. BERMAN TOLD THAT THEY ARE SCAM ARTISTS THAT ARE FAKE BUT THEY DON'T REALLY EXIST. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM. AND THEN PEOPLE WONDER WHY SO MANY TRY TO SELF HARM. YOU KNOW THIS THIS IS ALSO TRANS TRANSGENDER PEOPLE ARE NOT NEW. TRANSFERABLE ALWAYS EXISTED IN SOCIETY WE KNOW THAT A NATIVE AMERICAN TRADITIONS. TRANSGENDER PEOPLE WORK CELEBRATED HAD A SPECIAL CHERISHED STATUS FOREVER. ROBERT IN IN SOME JEWISH LEGAL TRADITIONS FROM CENTURIES AND CENTURIES AND MILLENNIA AGO. THERE ARE SIX GENDERS THERE'S A RECOGNITION THE NOT THAT THAT'S NOT A PURE BINARY THE DOES THERE THERE ARE THERE IS A SPECTRUM. AND SO THIS IS NOT NEW. BUT WHAT IS NEW. ARE THE ATTACKS AND THE DEMONISATION AND THE DISTORTION OF RELIGION TO JUSTIFY THOSE ATTACKS ON OUR TRANSIT LINES AND PARTICULAR TRANS CHILDREN- TIME TALKED ABOUT THE EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE AGAINST TRANS PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR TRANS WOMEN OF COLOR WHO ARE BEING MURDERED ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO RESET HOW THE HELL WE TALK ABOUT TRANS PEOPLE IT'S NOT OKAY THE DEMONISATION THAT'S HAPPENING AND ON THIS TRANS THEIR VISIBILITY WE NEED TO RECONNECT TO SUPPORT.

THANK YOU CENTER PATTERSON CENTER SKINNER CENTERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE SIXTY ONE IN THE SPHERE OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER- LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS- MOTORIZED IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE SIXTY ONE RECOGNIZES TRANSGENDER DAY OF VISIBILITY AND PAID FOR THAT- THE AUTHOR OF THIS RESOLUTION ASSEMBLY IS A MEMBER OF OUR CAUCUS. YOU KNOW THE- THIS RESOLUTION ACOSTA RAISING AWARENESS OF THE MANY HARDSHIPS AND SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS OF TRANS GENDER NON CONFORMING OR INTERSEX COMMUNITIES. UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE CULTURE RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES THERE ARE SOME EVEN WITHIN THE API COMMUNITY WHO STILL EXPRESS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND FEAR TOWARDS. THE TGI COMMUNITY. HOWEVER RESOLUTIONS LIKE THIS ONE EIGHT ZERO ONE SIXTY ONE HELPS BRIDGE THE CONVERSATIONS THE LETTERS IN THE- ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER TGI COMMUNITY KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT ALONE. VISIBILITY WHICH IS SOMETHING OUR COMMUNITY HAS CONSTANTLY TALKED ABOUT OUR LACK OF VISIBILITY VISIBILITY IS THE FIRST STEP. IN ADVANCING THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT INCLUDES. OUR FLY TGI COMMITTEE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY. HOWEVER ACTIONS MUST BE TAKEN TO ENSURE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS ARE REMOVED IN A HUMAN RIGHTS ARE UPHELD FOR ALL. I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AN ASIAN AMERICAN- SCOTT CHUNG WHO TOOK ACTION WAS AT THE CENTER OF PASSING THE LANDMARK RESPECT AFTER DEATH ACT. WHICH ALLOW TRANSGENDER PEOPLE TO RECORD THE CHOSEN GENDER ON THEIR DEATH CERTIFICATES. AFTER CHINESE AMERICAN CHRISTOPHER LEE A TRANSGENDER MALE COMMITTED SUICIDE HIS DEATH CERTIFICATE. LISTED THIS MAN IS A FEMALE. SCOTT CHARM WAS A FRIEND OF MR LEE'S AND ALSO IDENTIFIES AS TRANSGENDER MAN BROUGHT THE DEATH CERTIFICATE TO DETENTION A TRANSGENDER LAW CENTER. AS A RESULT OF MR TRANSACTION THE TRANSGENDER LAW CENTER AND INITIATE THE INTRODUCTION EVENTUAL PASSAGE OF THE RESPECT AFTER DEATH ACT. LETS US LEARN FROM THEIR EXAMPLE REMEMBER TAKE ACTIONS ENSURED THAT EVERYONE'S BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS ARE UPHELD. I WOULD ALSO JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY TAKE NOTES- AS NOT NOT AS CHAIR OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS BUT AS A- PEDIATRICIAN- REPORTS OF THIS ISSUE AND- I WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHED BY V. I. C. T. V. TELL MESSAGE OF THE GOVERNOR OF IDAHO. SO THE LEGISLATURE IDAHO- PASSED A LAW- BASICALLY BANNING. TRANSGENDER- THEN FROM SPORTS AND IN HIS VETO MESSAGE HE MADE NOTE THAT. IN THE STATE OF IDAHO DOOR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN IN SCHOOL BURKE THIS. YOU KNOW WE ARE DOING THIS LAW BECAUSE ONE GIRL STOCK COMPASSION. BUT THAT I ASK FOR I THINK IT. THANK YOU CENTER PENN CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE AS IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE SIXTY ONE AS VICE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. I'M AND I REALLY FOR THE VERY L. COMMENT BY A COLLEAGUE SO FAR ON THE RESOLUTION- WE ARE IN THIS FACE THE CITY OF MORE AND MORE STATE. PASSING LAWS IN PAUL. TO HURT WE CAN SAY DISCRIMINATE BUT TO HURT AND HARM TRANSGENDER PEOPLE AND AT THE SAME TIME. WE HAD A VERY INTERESTING NATIONAL. OF THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FANS OF JEOPARDY I HAPPEN TO BE ONE YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT MY CONSTITUENT AB SCHNEIDER WHO HAD THE SECOND LONGEST WINNING STREAK IN JEOPARDY HISTORY HE STARTED TO RUN LAST FALL. AND I KEPT IT GOING WINNING OVER ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS UNTIL I THINK IT WAS- NOVEMBER. OPENLY TRANSFERS NOW THE JEOPARDY HOST NEVER INTRODUCED AMY AS A TRANS NOR DID AMY STATE IT EXPLICITLY WHILE HE WAS THE CONTESTANT THOUGH SHE DID NOT HIDE IT WHAT SO EVER. EIGHTY NINE AMY HAD A VERY VERY ACTIVE TWITTER ACCOUNT STILL DOES. AND SHE WOULD RECOUNT HER IN STRATEGIES FOR WINNING THAT GAME BUT ALSO HER PERSONAL LIFE. IN IN THAT PROCESS ANYONE WHO FOLLOWED HER TWITTER ACCOUNT SORRY. PEOPLE I MEAN IT WAS AMAZING THERE WAS- ONE OF THE PEOPLE INTERACTING ON HER TWITTER ACCOUNT DESCRIBES HOW HE WATCHED JEOPARDY WITH HIS GRANDFATHER AND HIS GRANDFATHER WAS AT INFIRM BUT HIS GRANDFATHER HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY PREJUDICED. TOWARDS ALL LGBTQ PEOPLE AND THIS REALLY HURTS THE YOUNG MAN WHO WOULD WATCH JEOPARDY WITH HIS GRANDFATHER. BUT AS HIS GRANDFATHER OBSERVED AMY SCHNEIDER AND WOULD TALK TO HIS GRANDSON ABOUT. HE CONCLUDED THAT WELL YOU KNOW. MAYBE IT'S NOT SO. ODD OR MAYBE I MAYBE IT'S REALLY OKAY THIS WEEK COMPLETELY THE GRANDFATHER COMPLETELY CHANGED HIS MIND AND OPENED HIS HEART TO TRANSCEND LGBTQ PEOPLE FROM WATCHING JEOPARDY. AB SCHNEIDER HERSELF TALKED ABOUT THAT REALLY THE BIGGEST IMPACT OF HER EING ON JEOPARDY WAS CREATING THAT VISIBILITY AND NOT AWARENESS AND ACCEPTANCE FOR TRANS PEOPLE. SO I'M VERY VERY GLAD THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE ASSEMBLY HAS BROUGHT FORWARD THIS RESOLUTION. I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE AND MORE TRANS PEOPLE BEING IN VERY. PROMINENT IN PUBLIC POSITIONS SO THAT WE CAN ALL GET TO THE PLACE OF COMFORT. AND ACCEPTANCE AND SUPPORT WITH THAT I ASK THE ARRIVAL. THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN WOULD GO TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE SO ELOQUENTLY AND- AND WITH THE MOTION ON THE SUBJECT BECAUSE IT IS EMOTIONAL FOR PEOPLE IT IS ABOUT WHO PEOPLE ARE AND HOW PEOPLE IDENTIFY IN IN IN WHAT WE MANY OF US OBSERVE WITH WITH HORROR AND- FEAR AND- DISBELIEF THAT OUR COUNTRY SEEMS TO BE GOING BACKWARDS ON THIS ISSUE RATHER THAN FORWARDS AND PEOPLE SEEM TO BE TAKING THE LEAD IN- ENJOY. IN IN TEARING PEOPLE DOWN AND MAKING PEOPLE FEEL DIFFERENT AND I JUST LIKE TO MAKE THE POINT AS WE KNOW THAT THIS TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE IT WAS THE DEADLIEST YEAR ON RECORD FOR TGI PEOPLE.

RILEY INCREDIBLY TALENTED AN ARTIST A SINGER A PIANO PLAYER INCREDIBLY TALENTED WHO IDENTIFIED AS TRANSGENDER WHO WANTED TO TRANSITION.
