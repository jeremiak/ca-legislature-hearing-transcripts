SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR OPENING REMARKS OF HOLDING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING TODAY THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR WHAT WE HAVE KNOWN FOR DECADES OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE FOR AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. THIS SESSION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH A BROAD COALITION OF ADVOCATES AND LEGISLATORS I INTRODUCED AB THIRTY TWO. A BILL THAT PROTECTS THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ALL CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES BY SAFEGUARDING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. AB THIRTY TWO WILL EXTEND THE TELEHEALTH FLEXIBILITIES IN PLACE DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WHICH HAVE BEEN VITAL TO ENSURING THAT HEALTH CENTERS CAN CONTINUE PROVIDING SERVICES. PATIENTS WILL CONTINUETO EXPECT EXPECT ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH BECAUSE THEY VALUE THIS OPTION. ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO FACE GEOGRAPHIC MOBILITY OR WORK SCHEDULE BARRIERS TO ACCESSING HEALTH SERVICES. IT IS A PARTICULAR PRIORITY OF MINE TO ADDRESS THE BARRIERS IN REAL COMMUNITIES IN AREAS FOR WORKING FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I BELIEVE THAT WHEN IMPLEMENTED WELL TELEHEALTH CAN READ IT REVOLUTIONIZED HOW WE PROVIDE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE. I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME IN CHAMPING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHICH WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WOULD. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGIR CURRY THE COMMENTS FROM ANYONE'S OKAY WITH THAT- WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR FIRST SPEAKER. OUR FIRST BAKER IS MEKONG SHE'S AN ATTORNEY AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR CONNECTED HEALTH POLICY. AND SHE WILL PROVIDE N OVERVIEW TO OVERVIEW OF TELEHEALTH LAW AND POLICY IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WOULDN'T THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO REALLY GIVE AN OVERVIEW AND SORT OF FOUNDATION SETTING FOR TELEHEALTH AND TELL HOW POLICY IN CALIFORNIA AND A LITTLE BIT ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS WELL. NEXT FIVE. IF I HAPPENED TO MENTION A COMPANYOR YOUR PRODUCT OF MENTIONED PRODUCTS JUST WANT TO LET THE COMMITTEE AT NUMBER YOU KNOW THAT NEITHER I NOR C. C. H. P. HAS ANY TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP. WITH SUCH A COMPANY OR A FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT WITH THEM. NEXT SLIDE. A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND BUT HE C. H. P. WE ACTUALLY WERE ESTABLISHED AS A CALIFORNIA TELL HEALTH POLICY ORGANIZATION IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AS A PROGRAM UNDERNEATH THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE. BUT WE APPLIED FOR A GRANT THROUGH HER SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BECOME THE FEDERALLY DESIGNATED NATIONAL TELEHEALTH POLICY RESEARCH CENTER WE'VE BEEN SERVING IN THAT CAPACITY EVER SENSE. WE WORK WITH A VARIETY OF OTHER FUNDERS AND PARTNERS ON THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL ON TELEHEALTH PROJECTS. AND PAPERS AND RESEARCH WE ALSO ACT AS THE MINISTRY FOR THE NATIONAL CONSORTIUM TELEHEALTH RESOURCE CENTER. AND WE ARE COMING HERE FOR THE CALIFORNIA TELEHEALTH POLICY COALITION WHICH IS A COALITION OF OVER ONE HUNDRED STATEWIDE GROUPS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN TELEHEALTH POLICY FOR THE STATE. NEXT SLIDE. AND NEXT SLIDE. SO I WANTED TO BEGIN WITH WHAT EXACTLY IS TELEHEALTH AS THE DEFINITION DOES VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION AND SOMETIMES A TERM TELEHEALTH AND TELEMEDICINE ARE USED INTERCHANGEABLY BASICALLY THE BASICS OF TELEHEALTH IS THAT IT IS THE USAGE OF TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE SERVICES WHEN THE PARTIES ARE IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS THAT'S ITS MOST BASIC DEFINITION THAT'S OUT THERE EACH JURISDICTION DOES HAVE A DIFFERENT DEFINITION FOR IT- BUT THOSE ELEMENTS ARE BASICALLY THE SAME CALIFORNIA HAS A FAIRLY BROAD DEFINITION FOR TELEHEALTH AND THAT WAS INTENTIONAL WHEN THE DEFINITION WAS CHANGED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN- THE BROAD DEFINITION THAT EXIST FOR TELEHEALTH IN CURRENT. CALIFORNIA LAW IS TO ENSURE THAT IT IS ABLE TO DEVELOP AND GROW WITH HOW TECHNOLOGY INVOLVES AS WE ALL KNOW TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES AT A PRETTY RAPID RATE SO THE UP OPPONENTS FOR TEL HELP BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND THE LEGISLATURE THAT WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LAW THAT WAS EXISTENCE DEFINITION FOR TELEHEALTH WAS ABLE TO EXPAND AND GROW WITH THOSE CHANGES THAT TAKE PLACE FOR TECHNOLOGY. NEXT SLIDE. SO THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY WHEN WE WERE THINKING OF PRE HELD THAT FOR MODALITIES TO TELL HEALTH AND I WOULD BE USING THESE TERMS THROUGHOUT THE- TESTIMONY AND I THINK PROBABLY THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WOULD TESTIFY WILL BE USING AS WELL SO IT'S GOOD TO JUST SORT OF SET THIS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR WITH THE TERMS YOU'RE THINKING MISTER LIVE VIDEO WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW TO REAL TIME INTERACTION. BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES WERE IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS STOURPORT THAT'S THE CAPTURE OF INFORMATION AND SENDING IT TRANSMITTING IT TO THE SECOND PARTY IT DOES NOT TAKE PLACE IN REAL TIME SO AN EXAMPLE IS IF SOMEBODY HAS A SKIN CONDITION THEY'RE SEEING A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER IS NOT QUITE CERTAIN WHAT EXACTLY THAT IS THEY TAKE A PICTURE OF IT AND THEY SEND IT TO A DERMATOLOGIST WHO WILL EVALUATE IT AND LOOK AT IT LATER AND SEND THEIR OWN DIAGNOSIS OR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS LATER ON. BERMEL PATIENT MARK TREES CONTINUOUS MONITORING OF A PATIENT'S CONDITION FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT CAN TAKE PLACE IN REAL TIME WE'RE NOT IN REAL TIME SO A REAL TIME EXAMPLE IS THINK OF AN ICU UNIT THE INTENSE OF THIS MAY NOT BE ON LOCATION AT THAT MOMENT WITH THE PATIENT BUT THE MARGIN THE PATIENT FOR A DIFFERENT LOCATION AND TRANSMITTING INSTRUCTIONS TO HEALTHCARE PERSONNEL WHO ARE PHYSICALLY WITH THE PATIENT THAT'S TAKING PLACE IN REAL TIME. AND NON REAL TIME EXAMPLE IS A PATIENT WHO HAS HYPERTENSION AND THAT IS BEING MONITORED BY THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER THE PATIENT IS TAKING READINGS LET'S SAY DAILY READINGS AT HOME AND TRANSMITTING THEM TO THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WHO AGAIN IS NOT LOOKING AT HIM AS THEY'RE COMING IN BUT MAYBE LOOKING AT IT THE END OF THE WEEK AT THE END THE DAY AT A LATER TIME. AND IT IS REALLY JUST THE USAGE OF SOME SORT OF DEVICE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SOME OF THE SERVICES THAT USE ONE OF THE OTHER MODALITY SO A LAPTOP OR SMARTPHONE OR IPAD IS USUALLY WHAT PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS USUALLY. TAKING PLACE OVER APPS. THERE ANOTHER. THAT IS. THAT INCLUDES TELEHEALTH TECHNOLOGY BUT IT IS NOT CONSIDER TELEHEALTH AT LEAST IN MEDICARE'S AYE IN CMS'S SIDE. AND THAT'S CALL COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT AT BECAUSE WHEN COVERED HIT. THE CHIU SORT OF GOT VERY MUDDLED TOGETHER- BUT IT IS A TERM THAT'S BEEN COINED BY MEDICARE BUT IT'S SLOWLY BEEN SEEPING INTO POLICY BOTH ON THE STATE LEVEL. AND AMONG COMMERCIAL PAYERS AS WELL SO NEXT SLIDE. SO MEDICARE POLICY- IT IS ACTUALLY BEFORE COBIT NINETEEN IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE TELL HEALTH POLICIES IN THE NATION- IT COMPARED TO A LOT OF STATES IN THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAMS- WHAT COMMERCIALS REPAIRS DOING. MEDICARE I WAS VERY LIMITED IN WHAT THEY ALLOW TELEHEALTH SHOULD BE UTILIZED FOR IN PART OF THAT A BIG PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE TELL HAVE LIMITATIONS. ARE IN FEDERAL STATUTES SO CMS CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE UTILIZATION OF TELEHEALTH WITHOUT CONGRESS ACTING. SO WITH THOSE LIMITATIONS ON THERE A COUPLE YEARS AGO BACK AROUND THAT THE OTHER MODALITIES THAT COULD BE UTILIZED BUT- THEY WERE UNABLE TO ALLOW FOR THEM TO MEET THE MEDICARE PROGRAM UNLESS THERE WAS A STATUTORY CHANGE. CMS CREATED A BUCKET FOR ANOTHER CHANNEL OF SERVICES THAT THEY CALL COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES. NOW THESE SERVICES WE USE ALL THE MODALITIES OF TELEHEALTH THAT I JUST COVERED INCLUDING AUDIO ONLY FOUND TO DELIVER SERVICES. BUT THEY ARE NOT CONSIDERED UNDER MEDICARE'S EYES AS TELEHEALTH THERE THIS OTHER CATEGORY OF COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES UTILIZE TELEHEALTH TECHNOLOGIES. BUT THEY ARE NOT CONSIDER TELEHEALTH AND HOW MEDICARE HOW CMS ADMINISTERS THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. WHAT THAT MEANS THEN IS THERE THEY'RE ABLE TO COVER THE SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED THROUGH TELEHEALTH TECHNOLOGIES BUT BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONSIDER TELEHEALTH. THEY ARE RESTRICTED BY WHAT'S IN FEDERAL LAW SO THEY CAN SET UP THEIR OWN POLICIES OF WHO CAN RECEIVE THE SERVICE THIS IS. HOW THE SERVICES ARE DELIVERED AND WHAT PROVIDERS PROVIDE THE SERVICES. NEXT SLIDE. A LOT OF THE POLICY AROUND TELEHEALTH IS AROUND REIMBURSEMENT A LOT OF THE EXISTING SPECIFIC POLICY- OUT THERE AND THAT'S TRUE FOR BOTH ON THE FEDERAL STATE LEVEL NOT ALL POLICY THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT IMPACT TELL HELP OBVIOUSLY SUGGEST PRESCRIBING LAWS LICENSING LAWS. BUT A LOT OF THE ESTABLISHED PARTIALLY IS AROUND REIMBURSEMENT LIKE GETS PAID YOU KNOW WHO'S COVERED WHAT TYPE OF PROVIDED PROVIDE SERVICES. AND REIMBURSEMENT POLICY ITSELF IS. BECAUSE BASICALLY FOUR BASIC ELEMENTS AND HOW IT'S MADEUP YOU HAVE THE SERVICE THE LOCATION AMONG THE ALLEY IN THE PROVIDER SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT SEE A MEDICAID. POLICY THAT SAYS. THE MEDICAID PROGRAM WILL COVER OF MENTAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WHEN THE PATIENT IS LOCATED IN A CLINIC OR A DOCTOR'S OFFICE WHEN IT'S DELIVERED VIA LIVE VIDEO AND IT'S BEING DELIVERED BY A PSYCHIATRIST. SO THOSE ARE YOUR SORT OF BASIC ELEMENTS ABOUT REIMBURSEMENT POLICY AND WHERE YOU SAW A LOT OF THE POLICY CHANGES THAT WERE MADE ITS RESPONSE TO COVER THAT. NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A HUNDRED THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL OVER VIEW OF WHATPOLICY CHANGES TOOK PLACE DURING COVERT NINETEEN AND THE ISSUE AREA IN WHICH BOTH MEDICARE LOOKED AT AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS LOOK AT NATIONALLY. REALLY VERY VERY SIMILAR TYPE OF MODALITY THE TYPE LOCATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE LOCATED ON THE SERVICE TO PLACE THE TYPE OF PROVIDERS WHO ALLOWED TO. UTILIZE IT. OTHER POLICIES THAT IMPACT HOW TELEHEALTH IS BEING USED AGAINST SOME OF THE PRESCRIBING POLICIES WHICH IS UNDERNEATH THE A AND ALSO PRIVACY AND SECURITY- PROTECTION SUCH AS HELPED BY A PRIVACY AND SECURITY LAWS. SO THERE ARE CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE ENACTED IN ALL THESE AREAS BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE CHANGES RELATED FOCUSING ON THOSE REIMBURSEMENT. ISSUES THAT'S LIFE. SO CALIFORNIA POLICIES SO IN COMPARISON TO MEDICARE BEFORE COVERED NINETEEN. MEDI CAL IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE OFFENSE MUCH MORE PROGRESSIVE AND HOW THEY HANDLE TELEHEALTH SO MEDICARE HAD VERY STRICT RESTRICTIONS ON WHERE THE PATIENT WAS LOCATED THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL INSIGHT LIMITATIONS MEDIKAL. DID NOT HAVE ANY GEOGRAPHICAL LIMITATIONS AND FOR THE MOST pLOCATIONS UNLESS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COMMITTEE HEALTH CLINICS LIKE A FEW AGENCIES. OR RURAL HEALTH CLINICS. THERE WERE LIMITATIONS ON THERE BECAUSE OF HOW THEY'RE STRUCTURED AND SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT APPLY TO THEM. THE MODALITY THAT WAS BEING IS A MEDICARE YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY LIMITED TO LIVE VIDEO THERE'S THIS SLIGHT EXCEPTION FOR THOSE IN HAWAII AND ALASKA WHERE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO STORE FOR. FOR MEDIC HOW THEY ALLOW THE PROVIDER TO DECIDE WHICH ANALOGY YEARS. THEY COULD USE EITHER LIVE VIDEO STORE FOR AND IF IT WAS A SERVICE THAT WAS PROVIDED BY A COVERED BY MEDICARE OUT TYPICALLY IF YOU WHEN YOU DELIVER THE SERVICE AND PERCENT AND THERE WAS NO OTHER. FACTOR THAT WOULD PROHIBIT YOU FROM USING TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS AN IN PERSON ALAMAT TO THE SERVICE THEN THE PROVIDED COULD SELECT WHICH MODALITY USE FROM LIVE VIDEO OR STAR FOR. SERVICES AGAIN AND THERE IS REALLY NOT LIKE A LIMITATION ON THAT AS LONG AS IT WAS COVERED IN A REQUIRE LIKE A PERSON ELEMENT OR HAD SOME OTHER TYPE OF. RESTRICTION TO USING TECHNOLOGY. AND THEN PROVIDERS AND PROVIDERS WAS A PRETTY BROAD LESS- THEY ALSO DID INCLUDE FQHCS IN OUR SEASONING IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AS A PROVIDER. OF TELEHEALTH THOUGH THERE THEY DID HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS SO WHEN COMPARED TO MEDICARE MEDIC HOW IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY BROAD IT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE POLICIES OUT THERE WHEN YOU COMPARED TO OTHER STATES. NOW THIS WAS ALL PRE COVERED NINETEEN AND ACTUALLY SET CALIFORNIA UP IN A PRETTY GOOD POSITION WHEN THE PANDEMIC. CARE ACT. NEXT SLIDE. AND THIS IS JUST OF A ABYSS FORTY AS YOU SEE KNOW MEDIC. VERY LIMITED IN WHAT THEY DO MEDICARE WAS MUCH MORE EXPANSIVE. I'M THAT JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA THE MEDICARE POLICIES ARE REALLY ABOUT TWO DECADES AGO THEY THE LAST TIME THERE WAS A MAJOR UPDATE AND FEDERAL STATUTE TO THE MEDICARE POLICIES FOR TELEHEALTH. WAS BACK IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND THERE BEEN LIKE SMALL UPDATES OVER THE YEARS BUT THE LAST MAJOR CHANGE WAS IN TWO THOUSAND. COMPARED TO MEDICARE OUT WHICH ACTUALLY UPDATED THEIR TELEHEALTH POLICIES IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO JUST A FEW MONTHS BEFORE CALVET HECK. THAT'S LIFE. SO THIS IS JUST AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THEY DID AGAIN- WENT OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE A COUPLE OTHER THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHAT GOES ON WITH CALIFORNIA TELEHEALTH POLICY IS THAT THERE ARE. OTHER REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS A MEANS TO BE AN ORAL OR WRITTEN CONSENT THAT IS STATUTORY. ALSO BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HIT- THIS IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER AL GORE CURRY'S BILL AB SEVEN FOUR FOUR JUST PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT IMPACTED COMMERCIAL PAIRS. WHICH REQUIRE COMMERCIAL PAYERS TO COVER TELEHEALTH DELIVERY SERVICES THE SAME WAY THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN PERCENT AND PAY THE SAME AMOUNT. THOUGH THAT WOULD NOT KICK IN UNTIL JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO IT IS IN EFFECT NOW BUT THAT WAS NOT WHAT WE HAD GOING INTO THE PANDEMIC. AND THE LICENSURE CALIFORNIA IS NOT VERY DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF OTHER STATES AND THAT. YOU ARE REQUIRED TO GET A CALIFORNIA LICENSE IN ORDER PROVIDE CALIFORNIA SERVICE START SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENT OUR CALVET PEOPLE LOCATING CALIFORNIA. NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT WERE THE CHANGES MADE IN RESPONSE TO KOBE AS I SAID. HELPER WAS ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD POSITION GOING INTO CALVET WHETHER TELEHEALTH POLICY BUT THEY DID NEED TO MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THE FIRST BIG ONE WAS AROUND MODALITY. I SAID THAT THEY WERE. IN THE NEED THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THEY'RE ALLOWED TO USE STORE FOR AND LIVE VIDEO- BUT THE BIG THING ARE MERGED OF PUFFIN NINETEEN WAS THE REALIZATION THAT. WHILE TELEHEALTH COULD. BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL A VERY VITAL TOOL DURING THE PANDEMIC NOT EVERYBODY HAD ACCESS TO IT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS PERHAPS THEY DIDN'T HAVE BROADBAND ACCESS TO DIDN'T HAVE EQUIPMENT OR MAYBE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE DIGITAL LITERACY IN ORDER TO USE. OF THE TELEHEALTH A PLATFORM IN WHICH YOU KNOW THEY WERE TRYING TO REACH THE SERVICES. SO BY ONE OF FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL AUDIO ONLY PHONE WAS ALLOWED AS- OPTION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE SERVICES AND THAT WAS AN ADJUSTMENT THAT MEDICAL HAVE TO MAKE AS WELL. BASICALLY LIKE EVERYBODY. ELSE DID. NOT CITE. SERVICE IS NOT REALLY A LOT THE CALIFORNIA HOW DID YOU RESPOND TO COVERED EXCEPT TO EXPAND THEM ALLOW- SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS. THAT WERE ON FQHCS AN ARCH USED TO PROVIDE CERTAIN SERVICES SO. THAT WAS ONE CHANGE THAT HAD TO BE DONE NEXT SLIDE. AND THEN FOR LOCATION AGAIN REALLY NOT MUCH OF AN ISSUE FOR MEDIC HELP GENERAL EXCEPT WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT WORK ON THAT HEALTH CENTERS RURAL HEALTH CLINICS THEY HAD TO HAVE SOME OF THEIR LIMITATIONS BE LEFT THAT. PRE COVER NINETEEN THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO PROVIDE SERVICES WHEN THE PATIENT WAS. IN THE HOME UNLESS THEY WERE HOMELESS HOMEBOUND OR MIGRATORY WORKERS SO THEY WERE VERY LIMITED IN WHAT SERVICES THEY COMPRISE OUTSIDE OF LIKE THEIR CLINIC WALLS. THAT LIMITATION WAS LIFTED IN RESPONSE TO HELP THE- NEXT SLIDE. IN THE PROVIDERS AGAIN NOT REALLY MUCH THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO DO SO. SO CALIFORNIANEXT FLIGHT CALIFORNIA WAS ACTUALLY IN A FAIRLY GOOD POSITION AS FAR AS OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM CONCERNS. FOR COMMERCIAL PLANS AGAIN THEY HAD AB SEVEN FOR A PASS BUT IT HAD NOT BLIND TO THE FACT THAT SO THERE WAS JUST. YEAR IN ORDER TO LIKE PUT THAT HAVE THAT GO INTO A FACT. FAIRLY BEFORE LIKE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THAT WAS PUSH THE HAD THE TIME I WAS PUSH THE HAD A LITTLE BIT. EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF COMMERCIAL PAYERS YOU KNOW TO THEIR CREDIT DID GO FORWARD WITH A LOT OF TOUGH- TELL HEALTH POLICIES THEMSELVES AND LIKE WAIVERS IN ORDER TO ALLOW THEIR- BENEFICIARIES TO ALSO UTILIZE TELEHEALTH TO. NEXT SLIDE. OTHER THAT CROPPED UP DURING PUBLIC NINETEEN A LOT OF THESE ARE NOT PARTICULARLY SURPRISING BROADBAND ISSUE PEOPLE NOT HAVING CONNECTIVITY- LICENSURE ISSUE PRIVACY AND SECURITY- THOSE ARE. ALL ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP IN QUESTIONS AND THEY'VE ALL BEEN ISSUES THAT REALLY LINGERED AROUND WITH TELEHEALTH FOR AWHILE SO IF YOU'VE BEEN IN TELEHEALTH THERE IF THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY NEW. TO THINK THAT DID ARISE DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT I THINK MAY HAVE CAUGHT A FEW PEOPLE OFF GUARD WACHTLER OUTDATED FORMS. MECHANISMS YOU CERTAINLY HAD A LOT OF NEW PEOPLE USING TELEHEALTH WHO HADN'T USED IT BEFORE SO SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS- I'M NOW ALLOWED TO BILL FOR TELEHEALTH. BUT THE FORM THAT I TYPICALLY USED TO GET REIMBURSEMENT. DOES NOT HAVE WILL TAKE THOSE SECTIONS IN WHICH I'M SUPPOSED TO REPORT THAT I'M USING TELEHEALTH WHAT DO I DO. SO THOSE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT NEEDED TO BE CONSIDERED AS WELL THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE ENCOUNTERED AS A RESOURCE CENTER LIKE QUESTION WE WERE GETTING QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE SAYING LIKE. I'M A- I'M A LONG TERM CARE FACILITY I MATHIS ORIGINATING SITE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PUT THAT I'M ACTING AS THAT WHAT DO I PUT THAT CODE ON THERE SO. OUTDATED FORMS THE MECHANISMS. DIDN'T CREATE SOME PROBLEMS FOR SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY HADN'T HAD TO USE TELEHEALTH BEFORE SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE THOSE IN PLACE. AND THE EDUCATION OF PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS SO PROVIDERS THOUGH A LITTLE LESS OF THE FOR PATIENTS. THIS WAS A BRAND NEW THING FOR A LOT OF PATIENTS SO THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY- ARE NOT USED TO RECEIVING SERVICES. THROUGH A MECHANISM THAT THEY WERE UNFAMILIAR LISTED THERE NEEDS TO BE THAT OUTREACH AND EDUCATION TO PATIENTS AND A LOT OF TIMES ELECTED TO THE PROVIDERS. WHO A LOT OF THEM WERE BRAND NEW- TRYING TO START UP TELEHEALTH PROGRAM SO THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO. DO THIS PROPERLY THEMSELVES BUT THEY'RE ALSO TRYING TO EDUCATE THEIR PATIENTS TO SO THAT WAS A BIT OF A STRUGGLE THAT. I THINK SOME PEOPLE ENCOUNTERED. AS WELL. THAT'S LIFE. NOW I DO KNOW THAT THEIR ARE- PROPOSED. CHANGES HAVE BEEN BY THEM. AND ALSO DH CS IT'S COME OUT FOREIGNERS THE H. YES WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS LATER I. I'M NOT GOING TO REALLY GET DEEPLY INTO IT. BUT WE HAVE EXAMINED SOME OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES AND THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS THAT I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS. I UNDERSTAND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO READ BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHANGES THAT IMPACT. THE POLICIES THAT WE HAD BEFORE COVERED NINETEENTH ONE OF THE BIG ONES IS REALLY BASICALLY MOVING. THE STORY FORWARD MODALITY OUT OF WHERE IT WAS WHERE IT WAS AN OPTION FOR. BOTH PROVIDERS TO USE WHETHER THE USE LIVE VIDEO STORE FOR IT AND ALSO ALLOWING ATHLETES CC IS PART SOME STORE FOR SOME OF THEIR SERVICES. AND PUTTING IT INTO ANOTHER. AGAIN LIKE A BUCKET SIMILAR TO HOW MEDICARE TREATS TELEHEALTH SOME OF THE TELL HOPE ABOUT THESE. PUTTING IT INTO THE OTHER BUCKET OR THIS OTHER CHANNEL OF SERVICES OR MODALITIES. IN WHICH- NOT ONLY WOULD STORE FOR BE LOCATED BUT ALSO A REMOTE PATIENT MARCHING THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED TO BE ADDED. SOMATIC HOW AUDIO ONLY ANOTHER VIRTUAL TECHNOLOGIES OF USING LIKE THESE OTHER MODALITIES THAT HAVING IT SEPARATED OUT FROM LIVE VIDEO. LIVE VIDEO WOULD STILL SAY THAT ESSENTIALY THE SAME WILL BE OPEN TO LIKE YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PROVIDERS THAT WOULD BE OPEN TO LIKE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. BUT SOME SHIP OF MODALITIES INTO THIS OTHER. AREA WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN POLICIES ARE- THE SCHEDULES BASICALLY THEIR OWN DIFFERENT WAY OF TREATING THOSE MODALITIES. AGAIN IT SOUNDS VERY. SIMILAR AT LEAST IN ON PAPER LOOKING AT IT AND FROM WHAT I'VE READ SHE LEFT HOW MEDICARE'S SORT OF STRUCTURE THINGS BUT- WHERE MEDICARE DID THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE. LIMITED BY WHAT'S IN FEDERAL STATUTE THIS SEEMS TO BE LIKE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE TO DO THIS- AS FAR AS THE PROPOSAL'S ARM. MAY SO NEXT SLIDE. HOWEVER YOU KNOW NOT ALL CHANGES FELT LIKE IT WAS TAKING A STEP BACK. ARE CHANGING SOME OF LIKE WHAT EXISTED BEFORE COVER NINETEEN THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT. WERE BEING KEPT AROUND LIKE WITH THAT. THE TEMPERATURE CHANGES FOR SOME PROGRAMS WOULD HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO USE TELEHEALTH. THE LOCATION OUTSIDE OF THE CLINIC WALLS FOR FQHC SISTERS THAT THE HOME BE ALLOWED TO BE AN ELIGIBLE PLACE WHERE PATIENTS BE LOCATE ALLOWING THAT TO HAPPEN SO THAT WOULD BE STICKING AROUND AS WELL TO- BUT THERE THERE WERE SOME SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS FROM WHAT WE HAD BEFORE COVERED NINETEEN TWO. IF THESE PROPOSED CHANGES WERE TO GO INTO EFFECT AS THEY ARE NOW SO NEXT SLIDE. AND THIS IS JUST SORT OF A GRAPHIC OF IT IS THAT THERE ARE SOME CHANGES THAT BEING ARE BEING KEPT OVER FROM A PRE COVER THERE AFTER. SOME OF THE COVER CHANGES THAT WOULD BE KEPT AROUND IF THE PROPOSALS GO FAST AND THEN SOME NEW THINGS THAT THE PROPOSALS ARE ARE. OFFERING SUCH AS ADDING REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING. NEXT SLIDE. AND I JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A REAL AT SOME OF THE OTHER STATES ARE DOING AND FAR AS FAR AS LIKE WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THEIR TELEHEALTH POLICIES. SO WE'RE SEEING EXPANSION FROM WHAT THEY HAD BEFORE SO MASSACHUSETTS. BEFORE COVER NINETEEN BASICALLY HAD VERY LITTLE MEDICAID TELEHEALTH POLICY SO THEY ARE THEY DID DEFINITELY EXPANDED. SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY ARE DOING THAT LIKE CALIFORNIA AND I THINK ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS WELL THERE'S- OTHER MEDICAID PROGRAMS ARE STRUGGLING. TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO OF AUDIO ONLY PHONE. SO THEY ARE ARE LOOKING AT THAT SO FOR EXAMPLE NEW JERSEY HAS INTRODUCED THE BILL AT LEAST THAT REQUIRES MEDICAID PARITY FOR TELEHEALTH INCLUDING PHONE. WHEN IT'S COMBINED WITH ASYNCHRONOUS SO THERE ARE SORT OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO HOW YOU'RE DOING SOME OTHER STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS HAVE- ALLOW FOR AUDIO ONLY PHONE FOR CERTAIN SERVICES- OR YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE IS A TIME OF IT IN FOR LIKE. A COUPLE YEARS- WATCHING STATE COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS AS WELL AS MEDICARE MANAGED. CARE PLANS WOULD REQUIRE REVERSE FOR AUDIO ONLY FOUND TO BE THE SAME AS TELEMEDICINE THESE ARE INTRODUCED BILLS THEY WERE JUST INTRODUCED IN THE CURRENT SESSION SO. WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY WILL SURVIVE THE PROCESS BUT THOSE ARE A COUPLE THINGS THAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING. AND I THINK THAT'S IT I THINK WE JUST HAVE LIKE A LITTLE BIT. OF NEXT SLIDE. JUST OTHER. SO WE DO TRY THE FEDERAL POLICIES WE TRACKED THE WHAT. STATE IS GENERAL CALDERON AROUND THEIR TELEHEALTH POLICIES AND THOSE ARE JUST SOME LINKS ON OUR WEBSITE AND I THINK THAT'S IT AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE DETAILED OVERVIEW- I'D LIKE TO SEE. I WILL I DO HAVE A QUESTION BUT I'D LIKE TO. OPEN THIS UP TO MY COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS A QUESTION. THEN THAT IT'S BEST LEFT TO ME SO- SO. SO IT WOULD HAVE OTHER STATES DONE IN IN MEDICAID AND IMPLEMENTING AND- TELEPHONE IN TELEHEALTH EXPANSION. THE REASON I ASK IS IT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT RUNS THROUGH THE DISCUSSION AND DEBATE OVER TELEHEALTH AND TELEPHONE COVERAGE. IS WHETHER FEE FOR SERVICE OR CAPITATION OR SOME ALTERNATE PAYMENT METHOD METHODOLOGY IS THE WAY TO AUTHORIZE. COVERAGE FOR THIS MONTH MODALITIES SO WHAT'S GOING ON IN OTHER STATES. IF THERE IS A VERY STRONG FIRST SECTION TO JURISDICTION SO- TO START AT THE LIKE THE HIGHEST LEVEL. YOU ARE GIVEN MEDICAID PROGRAMS IS ARE GIVEN LIKE A LOT OF LEEWAY BY CMS AND HOW THEY DO THEIR TELEHEALTH POLICIES AND THEY'RE ALSO GIVEN A LOT OF LEEWAY WITH LIKE HOW F. TWO H. SEASON ARCH SEES. ARE REIMBURSED AND WHAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO WITH THEIR TELEHEALTH POLICY SO SOME STATES HAVE. DONE JUST STRAIGHT PARITY WITH LIKE THEIR PPS RATE- LEAVE WAS CAUGHT WISCONSIN WAS THE BLACK LAST ONE THAT DID IT- OTHER STATES HAVE DONE CAR BALLOTS. WHERE THEY HAVE- YOU KNOW. CAR ABOUT SPECIFIC TOPICS OF SERVICES THAT A FEW OF THE STATE IS DOUBLE AT THEIR PPS RATE AND OTHER SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE. WOULD NOT OTHERS HAVE LOOKED AT YOU KNOW DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES AND HOW THEY WOULD REIMBURSE THEM AND OTHERS HAVE JUST GONE STRAIGHT FOR YOU WILL GET THE SAME AS A FEE FOR SERVICE SCHEDULE SO IT'S GOING TO VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. AND I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY STILL CONTINUE SEE SOME OF THAT VARIETY ASK STATE START TO DECIDE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO GOING. FOUR FOR PERMANENT POLICIES BEYOND HOPE THAT. THREE WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MUCH APPRECIATED AND- WITH THAT WILL GO OUT I GUESS I WAS THE QUESTION WE HAD SO WILL. YOU DID A FABULOUS JOB OF AN OVERVIEW SO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- WE'LL GO AHEAD TO MOVE ONTO OUR NEXT SPEAKER THEN SO. OKAY THANK YOU HAVE. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS GEARING CORBETT WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM CALMLY NOTICED YOUR BURKE. WHO WILL SPEAK ON THE CURRENT STATE OF THE EVIDENCE ON TELEHEALTH MR CORBETT. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR WOULD THANK YOU SO MUCH AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I HAD A MOMENTARY GLITCH WHERE MY ZOOM APP WAS USING MY CAMERA SO IT'S- IN ABJECT ILLUSTRATION OF SOME OF THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES THAT WE NAVIGATE WITH TELEHEALTH- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. AGAIN MY NAME IS KAREN CORBETT AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS. REVIEW PROGRAM I NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. FOUR MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN OTHERS WHO MAY BE ATTENDING TODAY'S HEARING WHO MAY BE NEW TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM- A DENTIST DR WOULD SAID WERE KNOWN AS CHIPPER- AND WE ARE HERE TO SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE AS AN INDEPENDENT ANALYTIC RESOURCE- THAT IS HOUSED WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. WE CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE ANALYSES ON HEALTH INSURANCE RELATED LEGISLATION. USING MULTI DISCIPLINARY FACULTY DRIVEN TEAMS. ARE CHARGES TO PROVIDE A NEUTRAL EVIDENCE BASED ANALYSES AGAIN AT THE REQUEST OF THE LEGISLATURE. OUR WORK IS FUNDED THROUGH A SMALL ASSESSMENT ON HEALTH PLANS AND FULL INFORMATION ON OUR WORK IN AUTHORIZING STATUTE MAY BE FOUND AT. W. W. W. DOT C. H. B. R. P. DOT ORG. I NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO OUR FIRST ANALYSIS ON TELEHEALTH WAS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND THAT SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME AGO THESE DAYS- WE HAVE SUPPORTED THE LEGISLATURE ON SEVERAL KEY PIECES OF LEGISLATION IN RECENT YEARS. WITHOUT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AB SEVENTY FOUR FOR COMMERCIAL PAYMENT PARITY BEING THE MOST RECENT LEGISLATION THAT WE ANALYZED WHICH WAS ENACTED. EARLIER BILLS ADDRESSED COVERAGE OF TELEPHONE VISITS AND STATE REGULATED PLANS AND AS WE HAVE ALL TRUMP TELEMEDICINE TO TELEHEALTH. SO DID THE COMPLEXITY AND RANGE OF MODALITIES EXPANDS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THE TIMELINE OF BILLS ON THIS TOPIC GOES BACK A LONG WAYS- THERE'S A TERRIFIC TYPE IN LINE IN YOUR PACKETS- SENDER HELEN- THOMPSON WHO WAS TRAVERSE ORIGINAL BILL AUTHORED. WAS THE LEAD AUTHOR ON SB SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WAY BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID KAPIL AND HIS BILL CHAPTER IN THIS WAS RELATED TO REIMBURSEMENT. FOR USE OF STORE AND FORWARD TELEHEALTH BASED I CARE AND DERMATOLOGY. AB FOUR FOUR ONE FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOWNLOAD BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN REPLACE THAT OUTDATED LEGAL TERM OF TELEMEDICINE WITH TELEHEALTH. AB PORT FIFTEEN EXPLICITLY REMOVE LIMITS ON THE LOCATIONS FOR TELEHEALTH ALLOWING FOR ANY TYPE OF TELEHEALTH TO BE COVERED REGARDLESS OF WHERE IT TAKES PLACE. HOWEVER AB FOR FIFTEEN ONLY A LOT FOR THE EXPANDED TYPES OF LOCATION DID NOT MANDATE THAT IT PAY OR PAY FOR THOSE SERVICES TAKING PLACE IN THESE. OTHER TYPES OF FACILITIES. AB FIFTEEN. THE BAN ON EMAIL OR TELEPHONE DELIVERED SERVICES AS WELL. AND THEN WE HAVE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CECILIA AGUILAR CURRY GRANT TO CHAPTER BILLS IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AS DR. WOULD MENTION PROVIDING FOR PAYMENT- PARITY. AB SEVEN FOUR FOUR AND A BE FOURTEEN NINETY FOUR WHICH PROVIDED FOR A VARIETY OF EMERGENCY PROVISIONS DURING AND FOLLOWING. A STATE OF EMERGENCY WHICH WAS PRESIDENT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. FOR AN EXCELLENT- COMPILE ATION OF- LEGISLATION- THE RESOURCE- HERE I THINK IS A VERY HELPFUL LINKS WE JUST INCLUDED THAT. AS AN FY I ON NEXT FLIGHT THANK YOU- SO YOU'RE BURKE SHE ROLE- THE COMMITTEE REQUESTED THAT SHE BURKE TODAY HELP SUPPORT THE HEARING. BY HELPING TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS HERE ON THIS SLIDE BASED ON AN OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE WE WERE TASKED WITH ANSWERING WHETHER HEALTHCARE SERVICES DELIVERED BY TELEPHONE TELEHEALTH ARE EQUIVALENT TO IN PERSON SERVICES. WHETHER THE USE OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES AFFECTS THE USE OF OTHER SERVICES. HOW UTILIZATION OFTEN TYPE OF TELEHEALTH HAS CHANGED OVER TIME AND DURING THE COLD AT NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND WHETHER PROVIDING TELEHEALTH SERVICES ARE COST EFFECTIVE. AND INFORMATION ABOUT EXISTING DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO AND USE OF TELEHEALTH. FINALLY WE WERE ALSO ASKED TO PROVIDE A SUMMARYOF THESE FINDINGS IN THE FORM OF A BRIEF WHICH HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO EACH OF THE MEMBERS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. GIBBARD REVIEW THE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE FROM PEER REVIEWED AND GREAT LITERATURE TO ANSWER THESE TWO KEY QUESTIONS. DOES THE EVIDENCE INDICATE WHETHER SERVICE IS DELIVERED VIA TELEHEALTH IN SPECIFICALLY TELEPHONE. ARE QUICK ONE TO IN PERSON SERVICES AND DOES THE EVIDENCE INDICATE WHETHER THE USE OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES. AND SPEND SPECIFICALLY TELEPHONE SERVICES AFFECT THE USE OF OTHER SERVICES NEXT SLIDE. WHILE OUR FULL THAT THE LOGICAL APPROACH CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE I WANTED TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO TWO LIMITATIONS OF THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE WITH RESPECT TO TELEHEALTH. THE FIRST ISTHE PACE AT WHICH STUDIES OF TELEHEALTH ARE PUBLISHED FOR SIMPLY NOT ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH THE RAPID RATE OF CHANGE IN TELEHEALTH TECHNOLOGY. VERTICAL IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS RIGHT GOOD THINGS ARE MOVING REALLY FAST. AND THE SECOND LIMITATION OF THE STUDIES IS THE INABILITY TO DISAGGREGATE. THE TELEHEALTH SERVICES FROM OTHER INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS INTEGRATED WEB PORTALS THAT INCLUDES EMAILS AS WELL AS PATIENT INFORMATION ABOUT SELF CARE TEST RESULTS AND THE ABILITY TO REFILL PRESCRIPTIONS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER TELEHEALTH SERVICES ARE QUICKLY IN PERSON SERVICES. WE EXAMINED. HEALTH OUTCOMES INCLUDING BOTH PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES AND PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES. AND TO PROCESSES OF CARE OUTCOMES INCLUDING TREATMENT ADHERENCE ACCURACY OF DIAGNOSES AND THE ALIGNMENT OF TREATMENT PLANS WITH CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES. JOE BURKE EXAMINED AFFECTS OF TEL HELP ON THE USE OF OTHER HEALTH CARE SERVICES SUCH AS THE WAIT TIME FOR SPECIALTY CARE OR NUMBER OF OUTPATIENT VISITS ER VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OUR MEDICAL EFFECTIVENESS LITERATURE REVIEW RETURN ABSTRACTS FOR NEARLY FOURTEEN HUNDRED ARTICLES SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. REMARKABLY ARE MEDICAL LIBRARIAN WAS STILL ANSWERING HIS PHONE AND OUR SMALL TEAM PRESS SPORT ONCE MANY OF THESE ARTICLES WERE FILTERED OUT FOR RELEVANCE JUST SHY OF SIXTY WERE REVIEWED FOR INCLUSION AND ARE FREE FOR THE HEARING TODAY. A TOTAL OF THIRTEEN NEW STUDIES SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN BRING COLLUDED THE MEDICAL EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW FOR THIS REPORT. I WANT TO CALL OUT YOUR BIRDS MEDICAL EFFECTIVENESS- GRADING SYSTEM IN MAKING A CALL OR A JUDGMENT CALL FOR EACH OUTCOME MEASURE. TRAVERSE TEAM USES A GRADING SYSTEM ON THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE UNDERLYING STUDIES. FROM RESEARCH DESIGN STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE THE SIZE OF A FACT AND MORE. OUR GRADING SYSTEM ALSO CONTAINS AN OVER ARCHING CONCLUSION THIS CONCLUSION IS A STATEMENT THAT CAPTURES THE STRENGTH AND CONSISTENCY OF THE EVIDENCE ON THE INTERVENTIONS OF FACT ON AN OUTCOME. A GRADE OF CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE STUDIES OF A TREATMENT AND THAT THE LARGE MAJORITY OF STUDIES ARE OF HIGH QUALITY. CONSISTENTLY FIND THAT THE TREATMENT IS EITHER AFFECTED OR NOT AFFECTED CONSIDER THIS THE GOLD GOLD RATING. UPGRADE OF PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES REVIEWED ARE CONSISTENT IN THEIR FINDINGS THAT TREATMENT IS EITHER AFFECTIVE OR NOT EFFECTIVE. PERHAPS IN EASY WAYS TO CONSIDER THAT THE SILVER SILVER RATING. UPGRADE OF LIMITED EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE STUDIES HAVE LIMITED GENERAL'S I GENERALIZE ABILITY TO THE POPULATION OF INTEREST AND OR THE STUDIES MAY HAVE HAD A FATAL FLAW IN RESEARCH DESIGN OR IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDER THOSE BRONZE. NOW UPGRADE OF INCONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT ALTHOUGH SOME STUDIES INCLUDED IN THE MEDICAL EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW MIGHT HAVE FOUND THAT A TREATMENT IS AFFECTIVE A SIMILAR NUMBER OF STUDIES OF PEOPLE QUALITY MAY HAVE SUGGESTED THE OPPOSITE- THAT THE TREATMENT WAS NOT EFFECTIVE. AND FINALLY A GRADE OF INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THERE'S IS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT A TREATMENT IS AFFECTED. EITHER BECAUSE THERE SIMPLY ARE TOO FEW STUDIES OF THE TREATMENT OR BECAUSE THE AVAILABLE STUDIES% ARE NOT OF HIGH OR ROBUST QUALITY. I WANT TO POINT OUT IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A TREATMENT IS NOT EFFECTIVE IT'S JUST THE EVIDENCE- CANNOT GIVE US A CALL EITHER WAY. SO HERE ON THIS SLIDE AS YOU RECALL VOEPEL COMES WHICH INCLUDES BOTH PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES AND PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES. IN PROCESS OF CARE OUTCOMES WHICH INCLUDES TREATMENT ADHERENCE ACCURACY OF DIAGNOSES. AND ALIGNMENT OF TREATMENT PLANTS WITH CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES SUCH AS WAIT TIME FOR SPECIALTY CARE A NUMBER OF VISITS YOUR VISITS AND- HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SO FORTH. YOUR BURKE FOUND THAT THE EVIDENCE REGARDING WHETHER TELEHEALTH MODALITIES AND SERVICES RESULT IN EQUAL OR BETTER OUTCOMES THAN CARE DELIVERED IN PERSON IS NOT IS NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS THE TYPE OF OUTCOMES THAT HAVE BEEN STUDYING. SO IN ANSWERING THE CALL A QUICK WANTS TO IN PERSON SERVICES QUESTION. SO ON THE LEFT COLUMN FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES YOUR BURKE FOUND THE STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE REGARDING WHETHER TELEHEALTH RESULTS IN PEOPLE OR BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES BURIED ACROSS TELEHEALTH MODALITIES AS INDICATED ON THE SLIDE. LIVE VIDEO CONFERENCING WE FOUND CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE% THAT TELEPHONE RESULTS IN EQUAL OR BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES THEN CARE DELIVERED IN PERSON. FOR TELEPHONE WE FOUND A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE THAT TELEPHONE RESULTS IN EQUAL OR BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES THEN CARE DELIVERED IN PERSON. AND PER EACH CONSOLE WE FOUND INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE WHETHER YOU CONSULT CONSULS RESULTING EQUAL OR BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES THEN CARE DELIVERED IN PERSON. WE CAN YOU CAN REFER TO CHIP WORKS FOR BRIEF- PER FULL CITATIONS AND REFERENCES. NOW MOVING ON TO PROCESS THESE OF CARE- WHICH IS AGAIN THE DELIVERY OF RECOMMENDED CARE THIS IS IN THE MIDDLE COLUMN. YOUR BURKE ON THE STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE REGARDING WHETHER TELEHEALTH RESULTS IN EQUAL OR BETTER PROCESS OF CARE OUTCOMES THIS VARIED ACROSS TELEHEALTH MODALITIES. AGAIN AS YOU SEE ON THE SLIDE HARPER LIVE VIDEO CONFERENCING WE FOUND CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT LIVE VIDEO RESULTS IN PEOPLE ARE BETTER PROCESSES OF CARE IN CARE DELIVERED IN PERSON. BY TELEPHONE WE FOUND INCONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE WHETHER TELEPHONE% RESULTS IN PEOPLE ARE BETTER PROCESSES OF CARE THEN CARE DELIVERED IN PERSON. FINALLY I'LL TURN TO THE FAR RIGHT COLUMN. THIS IS USE OF OTHER SERVICES. YOUR BURKE ON THE STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE REGARDING WHETHER TELEHEALTH REDUCES THE USE OF OTHER SERVICES VERY ACROSS TELEHEALTH MODALITIES. LIVE VIDEO CONFERENCING WE FOUND A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE THAT LIVE VIDEO DOES NOT REDUCE USE OF IN PERSON HEALTHCARE SERVICES COMPARED TO CARE DELIVERED IN PERSON. FOR TELEPHONE WE FOUND INCONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE WHETHER TELEPHONE AFFECTS THE USE OF OTHER HEALTHCARE SERVICES COMPARED TO CARE DELIVERED IN PERSON. AND FOR EACH CONSOLE WE BOUGHT A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE THAT THE CONSOLE RESULTS IN EQUAL OR BETTER ACCESS TO CARE AND UTILIZATION THEN CARE DELIVERED IN PERSON NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THIS LIVE SHOWS- UTILIZATION OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES OVER THE LAST DECADE WHICH SHOT HAS BEEN INCREASING I'LL BET SLOWLY. UTILIZATION OF TELEHEALTH- HOWEVER THE UTILIZATION OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES IT INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY BETWEEN FEBRUARY AND APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC AND RELATED SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS. THE PANDEMIC REQUIRED PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS TO ADAPT EXTRAORDINARILY QUICKLY ROUTINE CARE LARGELY STOPPED BEING PROVIDED IN PERSON TO REDUCE THE CHANCE OF SPREADING AND CONTRACTING- CODED NINETEEN. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. DURING THE PANDEMIC USE A TELEPHONE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN MARCH AND APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY HOWEVER AS RESTRICTIONS AROUND TELEHEALTH TECHNOLOGY LOOSENED VIDEO USE INCREASED AND OVER TALK TELEPHONE. TELL HELP USES HIGHEST AMONG BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS RADIOLOGIST PATHOLOGIST EMERGENCY MEDICINE PHYSICIANS WELL TELL HELP USED AMONG ALL PROVIDER TYPES INCREASED DURING THE PANDEMIC THESE TRENDS HAVE LARGELY HELD. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. YOUR BOOKS UPDATED LITERATURE REVIEW ALSO FOUND SOME DETAILED COST ANALYSES BUT ALL OF THESE WERE LIMITED TO SPECIFIC TELEPHONE I'M SORRY TELEHEALTH SERVICE SPECIALTIES GENERALLY TELEHEALTH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH OVERALL COST SAVINGS OR WAS COST NEUTRAL. EXCEPT FOR A DIRECT TO CONSUMER TELEHEALTH STUDY WHICH WE DESCRIBED IN OUR BRIEF. NO RECENT STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED THAT FOUND INCREASED OVERALL COST WITH TELEHEALTH SERVICES NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. YOUR BURKE WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE ANY RECENT ANALYSES THAT REPORTED DATA ON TELEHOUSE AFFECTS ON COSTS OVERALL DURING THE PANDEMIC THE MAJOR CHANGES IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS AND CONSUMERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PANDEMIC MAY HAVE LED TO OVERALL COST INCREASES RATHER THAN COST SAVINGS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED. IN EARLIER STUDIES NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. NOW TURNING VERY BRIEFLY TO DISPARITIES AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. TELEHEALTH MAY IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SERVICES BUT DISPARITIES IN TELEHEALTH UTILIZATION PERCENT STE MORE INFORMATION ON THAT IS CONTAINED IN OUR BRIEF- IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CURRENT PANDEMIC RESEARCHERS HAVE NOTICED THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH POOR HEALTH. ARE MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM TELEHEALTH SERVICES BUT PARADOXICALLY THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO USE TELEHEALTH AND HEALTHIER INDIVIDUALS. THE DISPARITIES IN RURAL TELEHEALTH UTILIZATION MAY BE PARTLY EXPLAINED BY DISPARITIES IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND TELL AND TECHNOLOGY ACCESS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. TELEHEALTH ACCESS AND UTILIZATION VARIES ACROSS POPULATION GROUPS WITH NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS PEOPLE OF COLOR OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ALL REPORTING GREATER TECHNOLOGY BARRIERS LOWER TELEHEALTH UTILIZATION AND HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF USING TELEPHONE OR AUDIO ONLY. RATHER THAN VIDEO TELEHEALTH. TELEHEALTH DISPARITIES LIKELY PROCESS BUT MAY HAVE NARROWED AS A RESULT OF THE KOBE NINETEEN ENDEMIC. IN BE CUT DUE TO THIS- HEALTH SYSTEM CHANGES. THERE IS DISCUSSION OF SOME PROMISING RESULTS FROM RECENT CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION STUDY IN OUR BRIEFS. THAT SUGGESTS THAT INCOME DISPARITIES IN TELEHEALTH MAY USE MAY BE DROPPING AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE REPORTING HIGHER USE OF TELEHEALTH NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WE'RE IN THE HOMESTRETCH- LET ME JUST RECAP VERY QUICKLY BY REMINDING MEMBERS THAT USE OF TELEHEALTH HAS CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE LAST YEAR BOTH IN TERMS OF VOLUME AND IN DELIVERY. AND MORE LITERATURE EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS IS FORTHCOMING BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE ALREADY AS YOU SEE IT ALL IN OUR MEDICAL EFFECTIVENESS FINDINGS. ALTHOUGH UTILIZATION OF TELEHEALTH HAS DECREASED FROM THE PEAK- BACK IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY. IT IS LIKELY THAT UTILIZATION OF TELEHEALTH WILL REMAIN HIGHER THAN PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS ALTHOUGH THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS INCREASE IS REMAINS UNCLEAR. EDDIES OF TELEHEALTH UP NOT BEEN ABLE TO KEEP WITH UP WITH A VERY RAPID RATE OF CHANGE IN TELEHEALTH TECHNOLOGY AND CHANGES IN USE. AND THEN THE NEXT AND FINAL SLIDE. I JUST WRITE BRIEFLY WOULD LIKE TO THANK IF THERE IS A TRONG OF TRIP STAFF MARGARET PICS OF UCSF AND UC DAVIS JEFFREY ROMAN FROM UCLA. PROFESSOR JANET COFFMAN OUR MEDICAL EFFECTIVENESS VICE CHAIR FROM YOU SEE IF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME JOIN YOU TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THEIR CONQUESTS GINS FROM MY COLLEAGUES MISS WALDRON. YEAH IT JUST REAL QUICK THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND I WAS JUST WONDERING YOU KNOW SINCE UTILIZATION OF TELEHEALTH IS INCREASED- IS THERE A WAY TO SEE OR COULD WERE YOU ABLE TO TRACK IF. THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN EFFICIENCIES IN APPOINTMENT SETTING FOR PROVIDERS- WHAT I MEAN BY THAT CAN MORE PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET INTO A PROVIDER. WITH TELEHEALTH BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THAT MAY NOT BE THE DELAYS THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED WITH IN PERSON VISITS- DOESN'T SHORTEN THE TIME. THAT PEOPLE CAN GET IN FOR AN APPOINTMENT I MEAN I RECALL OF SEVERAL TIMES TRYING TO GET INTO A PROVIDER AND WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE WEEKS MAYBE EVEN MONTHS BEFORE I COULD GET IN. HAS THERE BEEN ANY INCREASE TO ACCESS. IN THAT REGARD. SURE THANK YOU KNOW THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK SOME OTHER FOLKS WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO IT BETTER- BECAUSE THEY ARE- YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING MORE AT THE IMPACTS OF COVERAGE. BUT ANECDOTALLY- CERTAINLY I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE VERY MUCH ON TO SOMETHING WHEN IT COMES TO- THROUGHPUT AND THE CHALLENGES OF HAVING SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND CLINIC ENVIRONMENTS. CLEANING AND SOME OF THE OTHER- CHALLENGES OF HAVING PROVIDERS AND STAFF ON SITE AND IT- CLINIC BASE LOCATIONS ARE CLINICAL LOCATIONS. SO I THINK THAT'S VERY MUCH TRUE- FROM A PANDEMIC- STANDPOINT- AND THEY'RE PROBABLY OTHER ADDITION SEES PARTICULARLY WITH NO SHOW RATES AND- AND SO FORTH. AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S THE ISSUE OF TRANSPORTATION- PEOPLE HAVING TO TAKE TIME OFF FROM WORK TO ACCESS CARE AND SO FORTH SO. YOU'RE A LOT OF AYE AYE THIN COMPONENTS YOU'RE QUITE. EXCELLENT QUESTION. THANK YOU ANY. OKAY HI I HAVE A QUESTION OKAY SO- PERSONAL AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH REALLY APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION- THE BACKGROUND BRIEF IDENTIFIES THAT TELEHEALTH IS USES THE HIGHEST AMONG BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHICH ISN'T ANY SURPRISE TO ME- THE OTHER- PROVIDERS LISTED IN YOUR PRE FOR RADIOLOGISTS PATHOLOGISTS ER DOCTORS. BUT NOT PRIMARY CARE SO DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THIS. WELL I THINK IT IT YOU KNOW IMPART- HE IS AN ADOPTION STANDPOINT AND A MINDSET AS AND SO I PROVIDERS GET USED TO SORT OF SOME OF THE- PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF- YOU KNOW COMPONENTS OF THE IN PERSON PHYSICAL EXAM. I THINK THAT IS CHANGING OVER TIME- AND I THINK SOME OF OUR OTHER EXPERTS MAY WELL BE ABLE TO GIVE- AN EXPERT ANSWER ON THAT EVEN BETTER BUT I THINK SOME OF THAT IS THE- THE SORT OF- TRADITIONS OF A PRIMARY CARE VISIT- AND I THINK. THOSE IN LARGER- LARGER SYSTEMS- ARE ADAPTED- AND MOVED TO TELEHEALTH MORE MORE AS THE PAST YEAR- EXISTED I THINK OTHER PROVIDERS WERE ABLE TO TRANSITION MORE QUICKLY- AND THERE WERE SOME LOWER THRESHOLDS TO MAKE THAT LEAP. OKAY GREAT. SO IN TERMS OF THE COST OF TELUGU HEALTH AM I CORRECT THAT- BUT IN YOUR BACKGROUND THAT THE COST EFFECTIVE THIS PORTION OF YOUR BACK ON A BRIEF. DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PAYMENT PARITY REQUIREMENT FOR TELE HEALTH AND TELE OF. TELEPHONE VISITS AND MEDICARE. RIGHT SO WHERE WERE WE WERE BASING THIS OFF OF THE BROADLY AVAILABLE LITERATURE I THINK- YOU KNOW THE PROOF WILL BE IN THE PUTTING IN TERMS OF DOING SOME RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES AFTER IN CALIFORNIA IN THE NEXT YEAR TOO. AND I THINK- WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET TO THAT THAT KEY QUESTIONS SO RIGHT NOW THE DATA JUST TO SIMPLY DOESN'T EXISTS AND SO OKA GREAT CORRECT. WHAT WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CORBETT MUCH APPRECIATED AND- JUST A COMMENT- JUST I CAN'T SAY HOW MUCH- THIS COMMITTEE APPRECIATES YOUR WORK- IN ANALYZING BILLS THAT THAT COME BEFORE US AND THE COSTS ON THE SYSTEM SO. MUCH APPRECIATED NINE NO- I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR REPORTS IN THE IN THE YEAR TO COME HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY. OKAY I'M OUR NEXT TWO SPEAKERS ARE FROM TO THE TOP UNIVERSITIES IN THE COUNTRY. DR MEHROTRA IS THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE POLICY AND MEDICINE AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND DR ANAYA IS AN ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE AT THE DAVID GEFFEN GEFFEN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT UCLA THEY BOTH SPOKEN AND PUBLISHED ON THE SUBJECT OF TELEHEALTH AND THEY WILL SPEAK ON- WITH THE POST PANDEMIC REGULATORY AND PAYMENT LANDSCAPE SHOULD LOOK LIKE FOR TELEHEALTH SO WE'LL START WITH THE DOCTOR- DOCTOR MAROTTA WHO'S ACTUALLY I ASSUME YOU'RE OUT EAST AND WHERE IT'S SIX THIRTY IN THE EVENING. DARK AND COLD AND MAYBE EVEN SNOWING- SO- IT'S WARM AND SUNNY HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WELCOME TO CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU DR WAIT AFTER THAT INTRODUCTION IT IS COLD AND SNOW HERE IS YOU HAVE TO RUB IT IN. A BIT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT COMMITTEE FOR- I PROVIDING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU. WHAT I'M HOPING I CAN DO IN THAT IN MY- ORAL- COMMENTS HERE IS TO PROVIDE SOUND POLICY FRAMEWORK HOW DO WE THINK THROUGH WHAT POST PANDEMIC IN INTENT REGULATIONS FOR TELEMEDICINE TO LOOK LIKE- NEXT LIKE. THE FIRST THING IS WHILE- BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE'S SOME URGENCY IN FIGURING THIS OUT. I THINK IT'S WELL RECOGNIZED THAT TELEMEDICINE USE HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED DURING THE PANDEMIC WHAT I THINK IS A UNDER RECOGNIZED. IS THAT SINCE THAT PEAK IT HAS FALLEN QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY- IN THIS IS A WORK WHERE WE'VE BEEN ANALYZING WHAT NUMBER THE NUMBER OF TELEHEALTH VISITS ACROSS FIFTY THOUSAND PROVIDERS IN THE UNITED STATES AS A PERCENTAGE THEIR BASELINE VISITS AND WE SEE AS- ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT THERE WAS A HUGE SURGE INTIMATE APRIL. BUT SINCE THAT POINT WE'VE SEEN IT DECLINED BY MORE THAN 50% OUR REASONS FOR THAT. BUT INCLUDING IN PERTH I CLINICS REOPENED THROUGHOUT THE NATION WELL ONE OF THE MAJOR ONES AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT CLINICIANS- ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHAT POST PANDEMIC PAYMENT POLICIES GONNA LOOK LIKE. AND IF YOU'RE A BUSY CLINICIAN WHO JUST GONE THROUGH A VERY ROUGH TIME FINANCIALLY WHY WOULD YOU MAKE THAT INVESTMENT WHEN YOU KNOW THAT CALM SUMMER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. YOU NO LONGER WILL BE REIMBURSED AND SO THOSE INVESTMENTS WILL BE FOR NOT. NEXT SLIDE. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I VIEW LIKE SO MUCH IN POLICY MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT THAT WE FACE IN EXPANSIONS OF TELEMEDICINE HOW DO WE IMPROVE THE ACCESS AND THE QUALITY OF THE CARE THAT PATIENTS RECEIVE BUT THERE'S ALSO THIS RISK OF SPENDING AND AS I SAID IN SOME OF THE WRITTEN MATERIALS AND I CIRCULATED TELEMEDICINE'S ABILITY TO MAKE THEIR CONVENIENCE AND MORE ACCESSIBLE THE KEY TO ITS ENORMOUS POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF MANY PATIENTS MAY ALSO BE ITS ACHILLES HEEL IN TERMS OF. INCREASED UTILIZATION AND SPENDING. NEXT SLIDE. IN TERMS OF A FRAMEWORK I THINK THERE'S A TO BE A HIGH LEVEL POINTS THAT I WANT TO START WITH THE FIRST IS I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A SINGLE TELEMEDICINE POLICY IF WE WENT TO A YOU KNOW A CLINICIAN A HEALTH PLAN POLICY MAKERS A WHAT'S YOUR DRUG POLICY. YOU CAN LOOK A LITTLE FUNNY WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE DRUG POLICY WHICH DRUG. WHICH PATIENT WHICH CLINICAL SCENARIO AND I THINK THAT'S THE SAME LANDS BY WHICH WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT TELEMEDICINE THAT THERE IS NO SINGLE POLICY ACROSS ALL OF THOSE- PATIENT POPULATIONS AND CLINICAL CONDITIONS. AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS THAT OKAY WHICH AGENTS OR CONDITIONS YOU RECOVER AND REALLY THINK THAT SHOULD BE DONE THROUGH THE LENS OF VALUE. AND VALUE IN THIS SENSE MEANS HEALTH OUTCOMES ACHIEVED HER DOLLARS SPEND ARE WE GETTING. A BETTER BANG FOR OUR BUCK IN TERMS OF IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHAT DOES VALUE MEAN IN THIS CONTEXT OF TELEMEDICINE IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. WHAT ARE HIGH VALUE APPLICATIONS OF TELEMEDICINE. AND WITH POORLY CONTROLLED DEPRESSION WHO DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE PROVIDER NOW GETS CARE VIA TELEMEDICINE FOR SAY A PSYCHIATRIST AND IN THE TACTIC HIS DEPRESSION IS IMPROVED OR PERSON WITH POORLY CONTROLLED DEPRESSION DIABETES WHO NW GETS TO ACCESS THEIR PRIVATE WITH THEIR PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR AND THEIR DIABETES CARE IS IMPROVED. HOW ABOUT LOW VALUE UNNECESSARY FOLLOW UP VISITS YOU KNOW MISS JONES IT IS IT'S REALLY EASY WHY DON'T YOU JUST CHECK IN A WEEK OR TWO ONE YOUR DIABETES THINGS ARE WELL BUT I'LL JUST MAKE SURE THINGS ARE OKAY WE'LL JUST CHECK IN VIA PHONE OR NEXT WEEK WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER VIDEO VISIT OR PHONE CALL TO DISCUSS THE LAB TESTS THAT WERE TODAY OR YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY I THINK EVERYTHING'S OKAY BUT WHY DON'T WE JUST MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING'S OKAY AND I'LL CALL I'LL CALL AND HAVE A VIDEO VISIT OR A PHONE CALL WITH MY DOCTOR TO MAKE SURE THAT I. IT'S REALLY JUST A COLD. NONE OF THESE ARE MALICIOUS. ON EITHER THE PROVIDER OR THE PATIENT'S SIDE. BUT THE REASON I HIGHLIGHT THOSE OF THOSE RING SAMPLES. OF WHERE WE'RE INCREASING UTILIZATION OF CARE. OR SPENDING. AND WE'RE NOT HAVING ANY SUBSTANTIVE BENEFITS IN TERMS OF HEALTH. AND SO REALLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO IN TELEMEDICINE PAYMENT POLICY AND REGULATIONS IS HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE THIS HIGHER VALUES. pNEXT LIKE. SO AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE IDEA OF WHEN YOU WHEN WE THINK ABOUT VALUE WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT WHICH HE SENSE WHICH CONDITIONS YES IS A PATIENT WHO LIVES IN A HIGH INCOME I DON'T KNOW BEVERLY HILLS AND HAS ACCESS TO PROVIDERS THE ADDITIONAL VISITS THEY HERE SHE MIGHT RECEIVE MAY NOT ADD SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH WHILE A PATIENT IN A RURAL COMMUNITY- OR- LOWER INCOME PATIENTS THOSE ADDITIONAL VISITS MIGHT BE HIGHER VALUE BECAUSE OF THE- RESOURCES THEY ALREADY HAVE. WHICH CONDITION IS THIS A CONDITION THAT IS UNDER- WHERE WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT UNDER USE IN PARTICULAR CHRONIC ILLNESSES OR WE TALKING ABOUT CONDITIONS SUCH AS COLDS RASHES AND OTHERS WHERE THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT OVER USE. IS THE CARE ADDED THERE VERSUS SUBSTITUTION I HEAR A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT TELEMEDICINE CAN REDUCE SPENDING BY. AT PREVENTING AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISIT. OR IS THE CARE ADDITIVE AND THESE ARE GONNA REALLY DO. IMPACT WHAT THE VALUE WORSE COST IMPLICATIONS ARE OF TELEMEDICINE. AND THEN LASTLY ON SOMETHING I'LL COME BACK TO A LITTLE BIT WHICH IS PAIRED. IF YOU PAY IF A TELEMEDICINE VISIT. IS PAID FOR LESS THAN AN IN PERSON VISIT AND IT WOULD IMPROVE THE HEALTH SHOULD THE SAME AMOUNT AND THAT IS GOING TO BE A HIGHER VALUE APPLICATION WELL- AND IF YOU PAY THE SAME AMOUNT THE VALUE MIGHT BE DECREASED AND THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT REALLY PLAY THIS IMPORTANT ROLE WE THINK ABOUT VALUE. NEXT LIKE. SO THOSE I HOPE THAT FRAMEWORK PROVIDES SOME CONTEXT AND THINKING ABOUT ALL THE STRATEGIES THAT WE SEE ACROSS BOTH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND MEDICARE POLICY IN DIFFERENT STATES AS WELL AS PRIVATE INSURERS IN WHICH HOW THEY HAVE APPLIED TELEMEDICINE POLICY REALLY IT'S ABOUT MAYBE NOT ALWAYS SAID EXPLICITLY BUT IT'S ABOUT HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE HIGH VALUE AT CARE IN DISCOURAGING LOW VALUE CARE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS WERE ALREADY ADDRESSED- THOSE ARE IMPORTANT IDEA WHICH IS THAT IF WE PAY PROVIDERS. AND A RISK CONTRACT AND THEY HAVE TO FACE THE RISK OF OVER USE THEY'RE GOING TO EMPHASIZE HIGH VALUE CARE AS YOU SEE IN SOME OF THE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION CONTRACTS THAT MEDICARE HAS THEY HAVE GREATER ITS AVAILABILITY AND USE OF TELEMEDICINE. IN TERMS OF BENEFIT DESIGN IN EITHER WE SEE A LOT NUMBER OF PRIVATE INSURERS WHO HAVE REINSTATED OUT OF POCKET COSTS IN THE LAST MONTH OR TWO FOR TELEMEDICINE VISITS. OR MEDICARE PREVIOUSLY WHICH REQUIRED A PERSON TO GO TO A LOCAL CLINIC. TO HAVE THEIR TELEMEDICINE VISIT BY INCREASING THOSE TIME COSTS ARE OUT OF POCKET COSTS THE THOUGHT IS THAT YOU'RE ENCOURAGING HIGH VALUE IN DISCOURAGING LOW VALUE CARE. WE SEE MANY- PAYERS LIMIT COVERAGE TO TURN PATIENTS FOR EXAMPLE RURAL PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS FOR EXAMPLE PRIMARY CARE OR CONDITIONS WHERE THE ON THE MEDICARE SIDE THERE'S EXPANSIONS OF CARE ONLY. FOR STROKE CARE A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND NOW MOST RECENTLY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITH THE IDEA THAT THESE ARE PLACES WHERE THERE'S UNDER USE OF CARE AND WE'RE GOING TO THE AIRPORT CHIEF HIGHER VALUE APPLICATIONS OF TELEMEDICINE. I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THE PAYMENT RATE FOR TELEMEDICINE AND THE IDEA IS THAT WHEN WE- PAID LESS FOR TELEMEDICINE WE MIGHT DETER SOME OF THAT LOWER VALUE CARE. AND LASTLY THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT MANY OF THE PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT HAVE EMERGED THAT PROVIDE ONLY TELEMEDICINE. AND SOME CONCERNS THAT THEY MIGHT BE PROVIDING LOWER VALUE CARE THAT'S NOT REALLY IMPROVING THE HEALTH SO YOU'LL SEE SOME REGULATIONS WILL REQUIRE AN IN PERSON VISIT BEFORE A TELEMEDICINE VISIT JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS THAT'S WHAT THE CONGRESS. HAS IMPLEMENTED FOR MEDICARE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH VISITS. NEXT TIME. I'D BE REMISS WITHOUT ADDRESSING A REALLY CRITICAL ISSUE WHICH IS THE ISSUES OF DISPARITIES OF CARE AND HOW THAT APPLIES TELEMEDICINE IN A PIECE THAT WE PUBLISHED LAST YEAR- IN THE SUMMER WE LOOKED ACROSS MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IT AT IN THE U. S. THAT'S HOW WHAT FRACTION OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES HAD ACCESS TO A COMPUTER. OR SMARTPHONE THAT WOULD FACILITATE THE USE OF A VIDEO MESSAGE. WE FOUND NOT SURPRISINGLY THAT THOSE- WITH LESS THAN A 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE AROUND HALF OF THEM DID NOT HAVE. A LACK AT THAT DIGITAL ACCESS. AND AS INCOME WILL INCREASE THE DIGITAL AVAILABILITY ADDITIONAL ACCESS INCREASED. WE THOUGHT IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BY RACE AND ETHNICITY AND WE ALSO SAW THAT RURAL PATIENTS NOT SURPRISED BENEFICIARIES NOT SURPRISINGLY HAD LESS DIGITAL ACCESS. AND SO THIS IS MADE SUBSTANTIAL CONCERNS THAT WERE ALREADY IT NEEDED TO- TODAY WHICH IS THAT- THAT THE EXPANSION OF TELEHEALTH BECAUSE SO MANY OF OUR DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS WILL NOT HAVE THESE- TO BE ABLE TO DO A VIDEO VISIT. THEREFORE THIS WILL INCREASE DISPARITIES OF CARE AND THEN AS DRIVENAS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE THE EXPANSION OF TELEPHONE VISITS- AS ANOTHER WAY OF PROVIDING CARE DURING AND THEN. NOW THE FUTURE OF ONE VISITS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AGAIN. THERE'S CERTAIN PATIENT POPULATIONS THAT WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IT. BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO WHILE TELEPHONE VISITS ARE RIGHT LIKE THE JUST FINE FOR MANY CLINICAL ENCOUNTERS THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERN THAT IN SOME CLINICAL ENCOUNTERS A TELEPHONE VISIT IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND WE NEED THE VIDEO COMPONENT AND IS THERE A CONCERN THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED PATIENTS WITH GAPS- WILL INABILITY TO HAVE A VIDEO OF INCIDENTS OF SUBSTANTIAL CONCERN. NOW NEXT LINE. HOW THIS ALL PLAYS OUT IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO TRY JUST LAST WEEK WE PUBLISHED A PIECE IN A JOURNAL WHERE WE LOOKED ACROSS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF ALL THIS IT'S WE'RE DIFFERENT PATIENT POPULATIONS THE UNITED STATES RECEIVING WERE VIA TELEMEDICINE. WE FOUND CONSISTENT WITH THE CONCERNS-ABOUT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THAT URBAN PATIENTS WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A- HIGHER FRACTION OF THEIR VISITS PROVIDE TELEMEDICINE. HOWEVER INTERESTINGLY WHEN WE LOOK AT- HE PATIENTS BROKEN DOWN BY. THE THEIR COUNTY AND WHAT FRACTION OF THE COUNTY WAS WHITE WE FOUND THAT AS THE POPULATION BECAME MORE WHITE THE USE OF TELEMEDICINE REDUCE. AND SO TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO TRACK. HOW THIS PLAYS OUT DURING THE PANDEMIC- AS WE MOVE FORWARD. NEXT SLIDE. SHOULD THE WRAP UP I WANTED TO PROVIDE MY OWN RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT A POLICY AND REGULATIONS I THINK THAT- AS MANY OF US ARE MOVING FOR MANY ACROSS DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS BUT WHENEVER WE HAVE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS FOR CLINICIANS- THAT'S GOING TO ENCOURAGE HIGHER VALUE USES A TELEMEDICINE. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE THE PRODUCTS BANSHA TELEMEDICINE ACROSS ALL CONDITIONS BUT I WOULD ADVOCATE FOR MORE LIMITED EXPANSION TO CERTAIN HIGH VALUE CONDITIONS SUCH AS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUCH AS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. AND CHRONIC ILLNESSES AND ALSO HIGHER RISK COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE RURAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS THOSE WHO GET CARE FROM SAFETY NET PROVIDERS. I THINK THE SAFETY NET PROVIDERS ARE THE KEY AND THOSE FOR REGULATIONS THAT WERE ALREADY ELIMINATED I WOULD MAKE THOSE PERMANENT IN TERMS OF FOR FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS AND RURAL HEALTH CLINICS. I AM AGAINST THE PAINT THAT PAYMENT PARITY. AND WE CAN DISCUSS THIS MORE IN DETAIL LATER BUT I FEEL THAT WE SHOULD PAY FOR TELEMEDICINE VISITS BOTH VIDEO AND AUDIO AT LOWER RATES THAN IN PERSON VISITS. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT CREATING A TWO TIERED SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES- AT EIGHTY AND IN CALIFORNIA. WHERE FOR PATIENTS GET TELEPHONE CALLS. AND RICH PEOPLE GET VIDEO CALLS. THOUGH I'M VERY COGNISANT THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO VIDEO BUSINESS RIGHT NOW AND SO WHAT I'M ADVOCATING FOR IS A LIMITED EXPANSION FOR TELEPHONE CALLS IS SUPERIOR TO FACILITATE BOTH ON THE POLICY SIDE CLINICIAN SIDE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO VIDEO ISITS ALL PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THAT. AND I SHOULD EMPHASIZE THE ONE NICE THING HERE IS THE WIND IS AT OUR BACKS THAT THE ABILITY FOR MORE MORE PATIENTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE VIDEO VISITS IS INCREASING AS ARE YOU KNOW SMARTPHONES BECOME MORE UBIQUITOUS. SO HEY NEXT SLIDE- SOME OF THE POINTS THAT I'VE MADE HERE I'M SORRY NO NEXT LIVE. ARE IN MY WRITTEN COMMENTS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. I GUESS ON THE CHATTY ONE TODAY SO I ALWAYS HAVE CLASS DOESN'T MATTER DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE TOPIC SO- YOU WERE PART OF A WORK GROUP THAT LOOKED AT WHAT TELEHEALTH POLICY SHOULD BE IN VERMONT. SO WHERE DID THEY LAND ON COVERAGE OF TELEPHONE TELEPHONE VISITS AND PAIN AT PARITY. AND SAY MEDICAID AND PRIVATE COVERAGE. YES I WAS I TESTIFIED JUST AS I DID HERE- TALKING I WENT AND SO I ACTUALLY DO NOT REMEMBER IN OTHERS- MAKE FONG AND OTHERS MIGHT REMEMBER EXACTLY HOW- WHERE THEY CAME DOWN TO ON THAT MY MEMORY AND I COULD BE WRONG ON THIS WAS THAT IT WAS NOT COVERED AT WITH PARITY FOR TELEPHONE VISITS BUT I COULD BE WRONG. OKAY I'LL BE HONEST I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT PAYING A PARITY WILL GIVE PROVIDERS AN INCENTIVE TO NOT HAVE PATIENTS COME INTO THE OFFICE OR TO SET ASIDE. PART OF THE CURRENT OFFICE HOURS FOR TELEPHONE AND TELEHEALTH BILLS. RECALLS SO. I RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THAT TELEPHONE CALLS AND VIDEO VISITS WILL WORK FOR A LOT OF PATIENCE. MORE IT WON'T WORK FOR INFANTS. OR SOME ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEARING LOSS OR- PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA- AM I WRONG TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT- WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS NO I THINK THERE'S CERTAINLY MANY PLACES AND I BELIEVE- MISTER CORBETT HAS CITED SOME OF OUR WORK WHERE WE LOOKED AT- THE USE OF VIDEO CALLS FOR TREATMENT OF INFANTS FOR- APPEARED FACTIONS AND WE FOUND THAT THE QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDED BY- VIDEO BUSINESS WAS INFERIOR. WITH A GREATER USE OF BROAD SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS FOR CHILDREN ARE INFANTSIN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. THAT'S JUST A SAMPLE OF- WHERE TELEMEDICINE CAN PROVIDE INFERIOR CARE I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT'S JUST ONE CLINICAL AREA THERE MANY CLINICAL AREAS WHERE AS DOCUMENTS RECORDED HIGHLIGHTED WHERE A TELEMEDICINE PROVIDES EQUAL QUALITY OF CARE BUT SO BUT A LONG WINDED WAY OF SAYING I THINK YOUR CONCERN. IS WELL FOUNDED. WELL AND I THINK I THINK IN GENERAL SO- I REPRESENT A VERY RURAL DISTRICT AND ACCESS TO SOME SPECIALTY CARE IS PRETTY LIMITED SO. SO THAT HIGH VALUE CARE THAT MIGHT BE TO BE ABLE TO BE DELIVERED THAT MIGHT SAVE A PATIENT- FOR FIVE HOURS ONE WAY TRIP. COULD BE A HUGE BENEFIT TO EVERYONE- AND SO I REALLY CLEARLY SEE THE VALUE HERE BUT I BUT I DO HAVE THESE SORT OF LINGERING QUESTIONS IN THE BACK IN THE BACK OF MY MIND ABOUT SOME OTHER OTHER THINGS- INTO TO THE CONCERNS. EXPRESSED ABOUT HOW TELEHEALTH IS A CONCERN ABOUT OVER UTILIZATION YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT IN YOUR IN YOUR LOW VALUE THE BILL VALUE VISITS- POTENTIALLY FRAUD AND I DON'T LIKE TO BRING A PRODUCT LIKE TO THINK THAT THAT'S NOT. A POSSIBILITY BUT- IT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER. SO FOR EXAMPLE WILL TELEPHONE CALLS THAT OCCUR AS PART OF ROUTINE CLINICAL PRACTICE NOW BECOME BILLABLE VISITS- DO WE HAVE EVIDENCE TO DATE ON EITHER OF THOSE TWO TOPICS- OKAY YES I THINK THERE'S A REALLY IMPORTANT. POINTS THERE- I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE COGNIZANT ALSO ON THE PHONE CALL SIDE. OF A POTENTIAL PATIENT BACKLASH AGAIN THIS IS ANECDOTAL AND I DO RECOGNIZE THAT. BUT PREVIOUSLY YOU WOULD CALL MYSELF OR ANOTHER PHYSICIAN AND SAY YOU KNOW CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME ADVICE AND I WOULD GIVE PEOPLE ADVICE. ON THE TELEPHONE AND I WAS JUST TIRED OF PART OF WHAT YOU PROVIDE AS A CLINICIAN. AND NOW A PATIENT DOES THE SAME AND A FIVE MINUTE PHONE CALL CENTERS INTO A VISIT AN AUDIO ONLY. TELEMEDICINE VISIT. AND THE PERSON RECEIVES A BILL IN THE MAIL FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS AND IF THEY HAVE A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLAN THAT'S OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKET. IS YOU DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT PATIENTS MAY NOT SEE THE VALUE I DON'T THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE THE GUIDING FORCE BUT I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE. THAT THERE IS THIS ASPECT OF- TELEPHONE CARE THAT WE NEED TO BE. AT LEAST COGNIZANT OF. REGARDING THE FRAUD ISSUE THAT YOU RAISED THAT IS AN IMPORTANT CONCERN. AND IT VARIES I THINK BY. POLICYMAKER HOW MUCH OF THAT IS AN ISSUE. THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND MEDICARE- PUT PUT OUT A PIECE I THINK IT'S JUST THE LAST COUPLE DAYS CALLING THAT. FRAUD IS A MAJOR ISSUE THEY CALLED OPEN SEASON. I'VE HEARD FOLKS IN- ON THE MEDICARE SIDE IN PARTICULAR AND MET TAX CONCERNED THAT TELEMEDICINE WILL FACILITATE FRAUD AND YOU KNOW IT'S- FRAUD ON STEROIDS. OKAY THAT'S VERY THESE ARE SOME BOMBASTIC LANGUAGE THAT FOLKS ARE USING BUT I DO THINK IT EXPERT THAT REFLECTS A- I THINK INAPPROPRIATE CONCERN. THAT TELEMEDICINE COULD FACILITATE FRAUD AND IS SOMETHING. THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE CAREFULLY MONITORED. WITH YOU THANK YOU FOR MUCH- AND- AT THAT THAT'S PRETTY QUESTION BY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- WE RING UP FRAUD. OBVIOUSLY IT'S A OF. THE RINGS A LOT OF BILLS FOR ALL OF US. I'M IS A PROFESSIONAL THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL YOU HAVE ETHICS AND- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH AND GETTING YOUR- DEGREE I THINK pNEED TO FOLLOW BY ONE OF IS MAKING SURE YOU DON'T HAVE FRAUD SO. I JUST WAS QUESTIONING THAT. BUT I'M IN YOUR STUDIES HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REGARDING- SKILLED- NURSING FACILITIES OR- HOME HEALTH CARE OR- I SEE WHERE THIS COULD WORK WELL IN FROM OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES GETTING PEOPLE. TO SEE A DOCTOR THROUGH A VIDEO CONFERENCE AND HAVE YOU HAD ANY- INFORMATION ALONG THAT LINE I'M TRYING TO BE REALLY BROUGHT ON HOW WE CAN GET SOME. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE TO- ARE SENIOR CITIZENS. YEAH AT. IDEA A GREAT AREA IN THE AREA OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES JUST FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR IT IS A REALLY CRITICAL ISSUE OF ACCESS TO CARE THERE ARE CLINICIANS WHO COMBINE WEEKLY OR COUPLE EVERY COUPLE TIMES A WEEK. BUT IN TERMS OF IN PARTICULAR SOME OF OUR MOST. OUR SICKEST MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY WHO. RESIDED IN LONG TERM- SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES NURSING HOMES THEY OFTEN LACK THE ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE THEY NEED. AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FROM A LOGISTICS FINANCING AND FINANCIAL. SYSTEM TO GET THEM FROM THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY TO- A SPECIALTY A GERIATRICIAN FOR EXAMPLE OR A PSYCHIATRIST IN DEPRESSION IS AN ISSUE. AND I THINK THAT TELEMEDICINE THAT IS A PATIENT POPULATION WHERE I. AM CONCERNED- GREATLY ABOUT UNDER USE A SPECIALTY CARE AND WOULD BE A POPULATION THAT I WOULD BE AT LEAST ADVOCATING FOR BROADER. GREATER EXPANSION OF TELEMEDICINE FOR THAT POPULATION. IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC STUDIES. THERE A COUPLE THAT I MIGHT HIGHLIGHT THE FIRST IS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES INCLUDING A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL IN NURSING HOMES OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WHERE THEY HAVE PROVIDED AFTER HOURS TELEMEDICINE COVERAGE. AND THERE IS A REALLY HIGH VALUE APPLICATIONS BECAUSE MANY PATIENTS IT'S ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT ON A FRIDAY THE NURSES AT THE NURSING HOME CAN'T GET A CLINICIAN ON THE PHONE AND THEY'LL SAY OKAY I'LL JUST TRANSFER THE PATIENT TO. THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY DISRUPTIVE FOR THE PATIENT. AS WELL AS ALSO QUITE COSTLY TO OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND THAT AFTER HOURS COVERAGE OF TELEMEDICINE WAS EFFECTIVE IN BOTH- IMPROVING THE HEALTH AS WELL AS REDUCING UTILIZATION IS A REALLY GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW TELEMEDICINE CAN BE USED THEIR- AND THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE IS SOME UNPUBLISHED WORK WE'VE LOOKED AT THE USE OF TELEMEDICINE. IN NURSING HOMES AND CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE SHOWED YOU PREVIOUSLY MISSED IN OUT PATIENT PRACTICES THERE'S BEEN pA VERY DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE USE OF. TELEMEDICINE IN NURSING HOMES- AT LEAST WHAT WE SEE IN THE MEDICARE POPULATION. SO WE HAVE SEEN AND HAD DISCUSSIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA REGARDING OF SKILLED NURSING OR NURSING HOMES OREGON HEALTH HOME CARE. AND THE INTEREST IS DEFINITELY THERE OF COURSE IS ALWAYS THE COSTS OF THAT RIGHT IS GETTING THEM THE- ACCESS TO A LAPTOP OR WHATEVER THE CASE MIGHT BE. OR AND LACKOF INTERNET CONNECTIVITY SO THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE COULD REALLY UTILIZE AND YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN REST HOMES OR- ARE NURSING HOMES IN HIRING SOMEBODY DIDN'T COMBINED SEEM ON A REGULAR TIME EVERYBODY GOT A LITTLE FRIGHTENED TO GO SEE SOME SO. I THINK DURING THIS TIME IF ANY THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT TIME THE TELEMEDICINE WAS- FRONT AND CENTER FOR OUR OUR SENIOR CITIZENS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S NO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE BOTH COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS- SOME AMERICA ACRE CORRECT I AGREE YEAH. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU AGAIN DR MARIA- AND- STAY WARM OUT THERE. THINGS GET REALLY APPRECIATE IT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND NEXT WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM DOCTOR AND IDEA. THANK YOU DR ED THANK YOU TO ALL FOR HAVING ME- SO HAS A DOCTOR WOULD MENTION THAT I AM AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY MEDICINE AT UCLA- AND I'M INTRODUCED MYSELF A LITTLE BIT JUST SO YOU KNOW WHERE I'M COMING FROM- AND THAT THIS PERSPECTIVE SO. I'M ON THE COURT FACULTY FOR THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM I HAVE MY OWN CONTINUITY CHANNEL AT BOTH OF OUR CLINICAL SITES ONE IS A UCLA HEALTH SYSTEM CLINIC HE AND THE OTHER THE FAMILY MEDICINE CLINIC WITHIN THAT COUNTY SYSTEM. I TEACH RESIDENTS AND MEDICAL STUDENTS AND I SEE MY OWN PATIENTS AT BOTHSIDES AND I DO HOSPITAL MEDICINE AS WELL- I AT WORK CLOSELY WITH THE LATINO POLICY AND POLITICS INITIATIVE AND THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF LATINO HEALTH AND CURRENT CULTURE. WITH MY PARTNER TO OFFER SOME OF THE WORK THAT I REFERENCE TODAY. AND THE LAND THAT I BRING IS OUT OF A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN AS WELL AS AN EDUCATOR AND RESEARCHER IN THESE VARIOUS CLINICAL SETTINGS- I THINK THAT PROVIDE ME WITH WITH BOTH A BIRDS EYE VIEW AS WELL AS A VIEW FROM THE TRENCHES. AND SO I PRESENT MY RECOMMENDATIONS TO YOU FROM THAT COMPREHENSIVE PERSPECTIVE AS A PHYSICIAN AND RESEARCHER WHO CARES FOR THESE POPULATIONS IN THESE CONTRASTING SETTINGS. I'M SO MY INTENTION IS TO BRING YOU MY EXPERTISE AND PERSPECTIVE REGARDING TELEHEALTH AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SPECIFICALLY. INCLUDING LINGUISTICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS AND HELP US TO PROVIDE YOU POLICY CONSIDERATIONS AND STRATEGIES TO ENSURE THAT REALLY NO POPULATION IS. NOT LEFT BEHIND BACKSIDE. SO IN ORDER TO AVOID WORSENING HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG ALREADY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AS WE ENTER THIS NEW ERA AND HEALTHCARE DELIVERY HEALTHEQUITY LANDS MUST BE APPLIED TO ENVISION WHAT TELEHEALTH IS GONNA LOOK LIKE. IN CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE APPLYING A HEALTH EQUITY LENS MEANS. REALLY HAD KNOWLEDGE SHARING THAT POPULATION LEVEL FACTORS. SUCH AS THE PHYSICAL BUILT SOCIAL AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT CAN HAVE A BIGGER IMPACT ON HEALTH OUTCOMES AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL FACTORS AND- THIS IS THE REASON THAT I'LL BE RECOMMENDING THINGS LIKE PAYMENT PARITY AND MY PRESENTATION TODAY. NEXT LINE. SO BEFORE HEADING INTO A DISCUSSION- OF WHAT THE POST PANDEMIC LANDSCAPE SHOULD LOOK LIKE I'LL BE DISCUSSING WHAT OUR CURRENT- TELEHEALTH ECOSYSTEM IS LIKE BECAUSE I THINK. BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT OUR NEXT STEPS IN POLICY RUN PAYMENT AND THE LIKE WE REALLY NEED TO FLESH OUT WHAT THINGS ARE CURRENTLY LIKE FOR THE SPECIFIC POPULATIONS THAT WERE HERE ABOUT TODAY- WELL ARGUABLY INITIALLY NECESSARY GIVEN THE OVERNIGHT NEED TO ADAPT IN THE FACE OF THE PANDEMIC. THE RAPIDLY ACCEPTED MODELS OF TELEMEDICINE GIVE RISE TO A VARIETY OF ACCESS BARRIERS FOR OUR DISADVANTAGED PATIENTS AND INADVERTENTLY LEAVING SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS BEHIND. NEXT LINE. AND AS WE WERE INVITED HERE TODAY TO AND FROM THE DISCUSSION AROUND AB THIRTY TWO AND THAT THE H. YES TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL START. WITH THIS DISCUSSION ON THE SPECIFIC STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES AND THAT WILL DOUBLE POPULATIONS ARE FACING IN OUR CURRENT MODEL- BEST INFORMING POLICY CONSIDERATIONS AROUND PAYMENT PARITY AS WELL AS TELEPHONE. OR AUDIO ONLY ABBAS AT CEMEX SLIDE. SO TELL HEALTH- THAT IS STILL HEALTHCARE THAT IS EQUITABLE IS ACCESSIBLE. BOTH IN PERSON AND VIRTUALLY FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF LINGUISTIC LITERACY OR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE UNDERLYING LANDSCAPE WITHIN WHICH OUR PATIENTS ARE SITUATED. AND THE STRUCTURAL BARRIERS THAT THEY FACE AS A RESULT- SO FAR AND UNSURPRISINGLY EXISTING LITERATURE IS DEMONSTRATING THE USUAL PATTERNS OF ACCESS AFFLUENT YOUNG AND NON HISPANIC WHITE POPULATIONS AND TELEHEALTH IN RELIEVING BEHIND. WILL NOBLE AND ALREADY UNDERSERVED PATIENTS IN THIS IS A SYSTEM LEVEL FINANCED. DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE ACCESS OR QUALITY OF CARE FOR MINORITIES HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY DOCUMENTED IN THE LITERATURE- PRIOR TO THE SKYROCKETING AND INCORPORATION OF TELEHEALTH. YOU KNOW ON AVERAGE OF LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE WORSE ACCESS TO EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE THAN DO NON HISPANIC WHITES BUT WORSENING THESE EXISTING DISPARITIES IF WE SET UP OR CONTINUE TELEHEALTH ECOSYSTEM SUCH THAT ONLY ADVANTAGE. POPULATIONS CAN USE THEM. SO THE VERY FIRST OF COURSE IS TECHNOLOGY AND THIS MEANS NOT ONLY THE PHYSICAL DEVICES- HAVE BEEN ALLUDED TO BUT ALSO THE SOFTWARE THAT WE REQUIRE PATIENTS TO USE IN ORDER TO ACCESS OUR PORTALS IN OUR VIRTUAL VISIT. BLACK AND HISPANIC ADULTS REMAIN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIKELY THAN WHITES TO OWN A COMPUTER OR TO HAVE HIGH SPEED INTERNET HOME DESKTOP OR LAPTOP COMPUTER COMPARED 258% OF BLACKS AND 57% OF HISPANICS SO. IF THE TELEHEALTH SYSTEMS THAT ARE EMPLOYED WERE REQUIRE VIRTUAL VISITS OR PORTAL ACCESS TO OCCUR VIA A COMPUTER RATHER THAN A SMARTPHONE FOR EXAMPLE OR- AND THE USE OF BROADBAND YOU'RE PHYSICALLY EXCLUDING A BIG SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. ON BEYOND HAVING A PHYSICAL DEVICE SUCCESSFUL TELEHEALTH USE REQUIRES THAT PATIENTS HAVE THE PREREQUISITE EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS THAT TO USE THAT REQUIRED SOFTWARE WHICH WE OFTEN CALL. DIGITAL LITERACY- AND DESPITE I THINK CREASING THE USING. ONLINE PORTALS THAT THEY ARE I TO INCREASE MISSION I. THERE'S I'VE EVERY ENOUGH MY- THOSE FOR WHOM ENGLISH IS NOT THEIR LINK PATIENTS WITH. A LOWER INCOME LOWER HEALTH LITERACY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIKELY TO USE PORTALS. BUT THERE IS DATA DEMONSTRATING THAT THESE WONDERFUL POPULATIONS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN PART ALSO THE ISSUE IS NOT ONE OF LACK OF INTEREST IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT. ANOTHER BIG ISSUE IS ACCESS FOR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY POPULATIONS. AND CALIFORNIA NEARLY 44% OF THE POPULATION SPEAKS ANOTHER LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME. ABOUT 19% OF THE TOTAL STATE POPULATION CAN BE CATEGORIZED AS LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT. AND AFTER ENGLISH SPANISH IS THE MOST FREQUENTLY SPOKEN LANGUAGE IN THE U. S. BUT THESE OF. ALLEY PEELING AND LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT PATIENTS AND THE PHYSICIANS OF CARE DESIGNED AROUND THE PROVISION OF CARE FOR ENGLISH SPEAKING PATIENTS AND- TELL HEALTH SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN NO DIFFERENT- THERE'S A RECENT STUDY OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY HOSPITALS ACROSS THE U. S. AND ONLY ONE HOSPITAL WEBSITE CLEARLY NOTED- INTERPRETER OPTIONS FOR VIRTUAL VISITS AND MOST HOSPITALS REQUIRE NAVIGATION IN ENGLISH. FURTHER MAGNIFYING THIS ISSUE IS THE VERY LIMITED SUPPLY OF LANGUAGE CAPABLE PROVIDERS AND IN FACT OUR PREPARATION RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SPANISH SPEAKING PHYSICIANS ARE THE MOST UNDER REPRESENTED. IN THE PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA NEXT LINE. SO NOT ONLY AND NOT ONLY HAVE PTIENTS BEEN AFFECTED BY PATIENT LEVEL STRUCTURAL BARRIERS BUT ALSO BY- THE BARRIERS THAT THEIR PROVIDERS ARE FACING AND THESE ULTIMATELY AFFECT PATIENTS AND HAVE AFFECTED DISADVANTAGED PATIENTS DISPROPORTIONATELY. SO NOT HAVING THE NEEDED HARDWARE OFTEN AS SIMPLE AS SAFETY NET CLINICS NOT HAVING WEBCAMS TO CONDUCT THEIR VIRTUAL VISITS. AND THE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION TO BUILD UP ADEQUATE EQUIPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE SO FOR EXAMPLE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM CAPACITY LIMITATIONS LIKE THAT ARE COUNTY FACILITY OUR SYSTEM DOES NOT SUPPORT LAUNCHING A VIDEO VISIT FROM THE CHARTER AND TO THIS DAY WE ARE STILL WORKING ON PROBABLY SETTING UP VIDEO VISITS FOR PRIMARY CARE PATIENTS ARE PATIENTS. DO NOT HAVE THE OPTION TO ACCESS VIDEO VISITS. EXISTING CLINIC CAPACITY SO THIS IS- NOT HAVING TECH SUPPORT IN MEALS THAT CAN TROUBLESHOOT DURING ISSUES LAUNCHING VIRTUAL VISITS WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE ISSUES. THAT COME UP WITH TECHNOLOGY- AND MORE SO OF COURSE IN IN POPULATIONS THAT DON'T HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE- TROUBLESHOOTING. FIRST THE CONSULATE BARRIERS IN AB A STAFF TO. THESE VITAL TASKS- AND THEN LASTLY PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES- WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE AWARE OF IS CONTRIBUTING TO DISPARITIES IN ACCESS NAMELY- LACK OF CONSISTENCY ACROSS BEARS AND ESPECIALLY HIGHLIGHTED AT THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC LACK OF PAYMENT PARITY WHICH WE'LL DIVE INTO- FURTHER IN A BIT BUT- THESE ISSUES REALLY HIGHLIGHT SOME AREAS WE. PATIENTS FOR EXAMPLE BY LIMITING PAYMENT FOR TELEPHONE VISITS BEFORE ADDRESSING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY FOR PATIENTS IN ALREADY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ARE ENSURING. EQUITABLE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS. MAX LINE. SO THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN I SEE HOW TELEHEALTH TOOLS COULD SERVE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE CHRONIC CARE MANAGEMENT AND IF DONE RIGHT AND THEY GET IF DONE RIGHT- IMPROVE HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS BY MEETING THOSE WHO NEED ACCESSIBLE CARE MOST WHERE THEY ARE- THE GOVERNOR RECENTLY NOTED IN THE CONTEXT OF VACCINATION OF FARMWORKERS THIS IS WHAT I WOULD BE IS ABOUT MEETING THEM WHERE THEY ARE. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN PRACTICE AS WELL AS IN THE LITERATURE IS THAT THE CONVENIENCE OF TELEHEALTH CAN IN FACT LEAD TO REDUCE NO SHOW RATES BUT THIS IS BECAUSE PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE CARE THAT THEY ACTUALLY NEED AND AS A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR SO I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT IF I GET A NO SHOW IN THIS LIGHT IS A QUICKLY FILLED WITH ANOTHER PATIENT. I CAN BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF OF THE EXTRA TEN MINUTES THAT I GET BACK LET'S BE HONEST THAT'S JUST TIME THAT I GET TO SPEND ON MY IN BOX OF LABS AND EMAILS FROM PATIENTS BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S REALLY NOT WHAT'S BEST FOR PATIENTS DELAYED CARE LEADS TO HIGHER COSTS LATER. IN THE FORM OF SPECIALS APPOINTMENTS ADMISSIONS HOME FOR THE UNNECESSARY COMPLICATIONS OF CONDITIONS THAT'LL CONTINUE TO WORSEN OVER TIME THROUGH WHICH A PATIENT DELAYS CARE THIS IS NOT A THEORETICAL RISK THIS IS WHAT WE SEE DAY IN AND DAY OUT IN CLINICAL CARE- I'LL VULNERABLE POPULATIONS YOU CAN ASK ANYONE OF MY TRAINEES ABOUT THIS DELAY IN CARE LEADS TO GREATER PATHOLOGY. MORBIDITY AND YEARS OF PAYING HEALTHCARE COSTS IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT BETTER PATHOLOGY IS SEEN IN THE SYSTEMS OF CARE IN WHICH PATIENTS ARE FORCED TO- BY STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO DELAY CARE AND THAT'S SOMETHING EVEN MY MEDICAL STUDENTS- KNOWING REFLECT ON SO REDUCING LIMITING HOW REDUCING SPENDING BY LIMITING ACCESS MAYBE WORTH CONSIDERING FOR WELL THE POPULATIONS WITHOUT EXISTING% STRUCTURAL AND SYSTEMIC BARRIERS TO KERR BUT CERTAINLY. NOT IN THESE POPULATIONS AND WILL MOST CERTAINLY NOT LEAD TO REDUCE COSTS IN THE LONG TERM AND THAT'S A DISTINCT DISTINCTION THAT I LIKE TO POINT OUT THESE PATIENTS DON'T NEED ANY ADDITIONAL. BARRIERS TO CARE. I KNOW VALUE- IMPORTANT A HIGHER IS THE WAY IN WE SEE. SURPASSING THE AFFECTED OF WHAT A TRADITION. IN PERSON VISIT MY HAVE I'M SUCH AS BUYING. IN A RECENT PAPER THAT WE PUBLISHED LIKE THE PHYSICIAN BEING ABLE TO DO A HOME VISIT THE ARBITRAL THERE OR AND- ALLOWING MORE TIME FOR COUNSELING AND EDUCATION THAT YOU MIGHT FIND IN. AN IN PERSON VISIT AND THIS CAN BE ESPECIALLY VALUABLE IN THE CARE OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE- AND IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE- SUPPORT BRIEF- IN THE DETAILS OF THE BRIEF AND STUDIES I FOUND THAT TELEMEDICINE VISITS EITHER DECREASE OR DO NOT. INCREASE FOLLOW UP VISITS. AN INCREASE TREATMENT ADHERENCE AND SO THAT. DECREASES COSTS IN THE LONG TERM. NEXT SIDE. I'M SO WE'LL LOOK AT FIRST THAT KIND OF THE LONG TERM- AS LANDSCAPE AND THEN WE'LL DISCUSS SOME ADDITIONAL THINGS WE CAN DO IN THE INTERIM TO GET THEIR- SIDE. SO A SOLUTION THAT'S GONNA SET US UP TO ACHIEVE GOOD INEQUITABLE OUTCOMES WHILE USING HEALTHCARE RESOURCES WISELY- IS INTEGRATED TELEHEALTH AS FOR EXAMPLE IT'S KIND OF HIS I'M FOR YEARS RATHER THAN DIRECT TO CONSUMER MATHIS. IN THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM WE CAN PROVIDE EFFECTIVE EQUITABLE CARE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE NEW OPPORTUNITIES THAT LIE AND TELEHEALTH WILL STILL CONTROLLING COSTS. THIS TYPE OF SETUP ALLOWS FOR IN PERSON CARE TO BE SUBSTITUTED- BY SOME VIRTUAL VISITS AND WHEN APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY PHONE WITH ITS WHICH ALONGSIDE REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING MONITORING ALSO WHEN CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE. TOGETHER BRINGS TELEHOUSE PROMISE IN PROVIDING BETTER MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT CARE TO FRUITION SO I'M TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE LET'S SAY WE HAVE A PATIENT MISTER STEVE BARELY VERY POORLY CONTROLLED DIABETES- WE CARE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT SENDING ABOUT FOR THE LONG TERM- COMPLICATIONS THAT LEAD TO FOOT. AMPUTATIONS AS AN EXAMPLE SO THIS IS A PATIENT THAT RIGHT NOW YOU'D ALREADY BE SEEING ON A MONTHLY BASIS BECAUSE OF THAT POORLY CONTROLLED A WHIMSY. YOUR PATIENT IS HERE FOR THEIR VISIT THERE TO FURTHER BUT EXAM REFORM THAT. IN SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS THEM TO ACCEPT ACCESS TELEHEALTH YOU SET HIM UP FOR A VIDEO VISIT THE NEXT TIME. THE PATIENT SEND YOU THE BLOOD GLUCOSE LOG FOR YOUR REVIEW BEFORE THE VISIT. AND IN A VIRTUAL VISIT YOU CAN REVIEW THAT IN DETAIL MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR INSULIN. BUT LET'S SAY THEY DON'T HAVE THE NEEDED INTERNET SPEED BECAUSE OF COSTS AND SO DESPITE YOUR EXCELLENT AND WE'LL SEE PATIENT CENTERED VIDEO VISIT APP. YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY LAUNCHED A VIRTUAL VISIT SO IN THIS CASE YOU'RE FORCED TO CALL THEM ON THE PHONE. BUT YOU ACHIEVE THE SAME CARE YOU WOULD HAVE BY VIDEO YOU TITRATE PARENTS LINE. YOU PLEASE REFER OVER THERE RIGHT NOW CAN'T- EXAM THAT YOU'VE DETERMINED THERE NOW DO YOU FOR YOU SEND THEIR INSULIN PRESCRIPTION TO THE PHARMACY. AND ALL THAT TAKES THE SAME TIME INCORPORATED THE SAME MARKET WOULD HAVE TO GET IN PERSON SUCH AS- AND IN IT AND AS SUCH IT REPLACES- AN IN PERSON FOLLOW UP VISIT. AND THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE THEM IN PERSON AND SO ON AND SO FORTH THIS IS- A SYSTEM THAT WORKS- BUT IS ALSO COST SAVING. IN THE LONG TERM. NEXT LINE. BUT TO AVOID UNDERSERVED VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THE CORE COMPONENTS OF IT THAT TELEHEALTH ECOSYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE TO PURSUE OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST INCLUSIVE TECHNOLOGY SO RATHER THAN JUST EXPECT OUR PATIENTS TO ADOPT A SUB OPTIMAL SYSTEMS OF TELE HEALTH CARE WE MUST IMPROVE OUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS TO MEET THEIR TECH CAPACITY AND THEN WORK TO IMPROVE OUR PATIENTS CAPACITY. NEXT ENSURING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE NECESSARY TECHNOLOGY IN BROADBAND WITHOUT WHICH THEY CANNOT COMPLETE VIDEO OF ESSEX TECH SUPPORT WHO CAN WALK PATIENTS THROUGH SIGNING UP OF PORTALS AND VIRTUAL VISIT UP TO HELP THEM TROUBLESHOOT IN REAL TIME AND REQUIRING PAYMENT PARITY FOR EQUAL CARE THAT- SO THAT PROVIDERS CAN REALLY PROVIDE THAT CARE THAT PATIENTS IN THE SAFETY NET NEED. BACKSIDE SO HAVING A VISION OF EQUITY AND TELEHEALTH- MEANS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH OUR PATIENT CONSUMER BASE SO FOR EXAMPLE THINKING ABOUT THE LANGUAGES THAT ARE SOFTWARE AND PLATFORMS ARE PROVIDED AND- MEETING THE LANGUAGE NEEDS OF- LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY PATIENTS AT ALL POINTS OF CONTACT IS REQUIRED BY VARIOUS STATUTES- WE ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT- TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OUR PROVIDER BASE WAS CARING FOR THESE POPULATIONS DAY IN AND DAY OUT AND- WHAT THEY'RE STILL MISSING TO ENSURE VIRTUAL ACCESS FOR THEIR- PATIENTS SO. THE TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT MAYBE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THAT TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPORT FOR PATIENTS. AND FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGING THE REALITY THAT VIDEO VISITS AT HOME MAY NOT BE AN OPTION FOR SOME PATIENTS FOR WHOM IT IS NECESSARY EVEN IN THE LONG TERM. NEXT SLIDE. A COMMITMENT TO PREVENTING FURTHER DISPARITIES MEANS SEEKING OUT THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL AND STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES IN DEALING CARE ACT ACCORDINGLY- ADDRESSING THOSE BARRIERS AND THAT AND NEEDS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED NEXT LINE. SO LONG TERM PAYMENT PARITY OR VIRTUAL VISIT AS YOU ALL HAVE RECOGNIZE MATTERS THERE AREN'T NEW OAK ASSOCIATED COSTS THAT COME WITH THE HEALTH DELIVERY ESPECIALLY WITH AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS INCLUDING THE DEDICATED TECH SUPPORT WE'VE DISCUSSED PATIENT CENTERED EDUCATION AND DIGITAL LITERACY AND PATIENT FRIENDLY PLATFORMS. ADDITIONALLY A PIECE THAT IS OFTEN LEFT OUT IS THAT AS A PHYSICIAN THE WORK ON YOUR END EXPERTISE YOU'RE CRYING IT'S EQUAL WHETHER YOU'RE PATIENTS IN FRONT OF YOU ARE ON VIDEO AND IN CASES SUCH AS WITH PATIENTS WITH LIMITED HEALTH OR DIGITAL LITERACY. YOUR JOB IS EVEN HARDER HOME VIA TELEHEALTH IN AT THE TOP HEALTHCARE SYSTEM LEVEL AND IN OUR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT CANTERBURY IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THESE VIRTUAL VISITS ARE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR WAY- INTO OUR CLINICS AND AS WE'VE TOUCHED ON- SUPPORTING ALTERNATIVE TELEHEALTH OPTIONS WHEN VIDEO CAPACITY IS NOT AN OPTION- IT REQUIRES A COVERAGE OF PHONE VISITS ACROSS PAYERS. AND AFFORDABLE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THESE EQUITABLE REIMBURSEMENT MEANS HEALTH INSURER COMPENSATES THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER AT A FAIR PAYMENT RATE THAT ALSO TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE ONGOING COSTS NEXT LINE. TO REDUCE THE NEED ARE DEPENDENT ON PHONE VISITS AS A STOP GAP- WE FIRST NEED TO ENSURE ACCESS TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NECESSARY FOR VIRTUAL VISITS FOR THOSE PATIENTS THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. IN A SIMILAR WAY TO PROVISION OF NON EMERGENCY TRANSPORT FOR LOW INCOME PATIENTS THAT GETS THEM TO THEIR IN PERSON APPOINTMENT HERE SHOLD PURSUE METHODS OF PROVIDING DIGITAL DEVICES. TO PATIENTS NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN THEM SO ENSURING DIGITAL ACCESS TO VIRTUAL VISITS FOR OUR VULNERABLE PATIENTS WILL ENSURE THAT OWNING COUNTERS ARE ONLY BE USED WHEN NECESSARY AND CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE. NEXT LINE. TO ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS ACROSS PEERS INCLUDING MEDIC HOW WE CAN STANDARDIZE THE APPROACH TO COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT. REQUIRE SAME BENEFITS REQUIRE THAT THE SAME UTILIZATION REVIEW PROCEDURES APPLY TO TELEHEALTH AS TO IN PERSON ENCOUNTERS. NEXT SLIDE. THANKS BYE. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON BUILDING UP THAT INCLUSIVE TELEHEALTH ECOSYSTEM WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING SINCE WE HAVE NOT YET REACHED THE POINT WHERE PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS HAVE THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE TO IMMEDIATELY DO AWAY WITH PHONE VISITS AND UNDERSERVED THINGS- ESPECIALLY AMID THE ON GOING PANDEMIC WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO CONTINUE PAYMENT PARITY FOR PHONE VISITS FOR POPULATIONS WITHOUT VIDEO CAPACITY WHILE COLBERT LINGERS AND AFFORDABLE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THESE VISITS IN THE LONG TERM. OTHERWISE WE'RE PULLING THE RUG OUTFROM UNDER OUR PATIENTS WHO ARE ALREADY BEARING THE BRUNT OF THIS PANDEMIC. SIGN. I HAD TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES WE CAN FIND PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE USER FRIENDLY AND PROVIDES MULTILINGUAL SUPPORT SO FOR EXAMPLE TELEHEALTH PLATFORM IS CONTRACTING WITH CLINICS CARING FOR THE SAFETY NET CAN BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE WILL TIGHTLY WILL SUPPORT IN ORDER TO DELIVER EQUITABLE ACCESS. EXIDE MAINTAINING QUALITY AND ENSURING OUTCOMES WILL NEED TO BE A LONG TERM PROCESS AS HAS HAS BEEN MENTIONED NEXT LINE. AND PART OF THIS PROCESS IS MAKING AN EQUITY VISIBLE AND IDENTIFYING AVENUES FOR SOLUTIONS THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE ONGOING RESEARCH AND APPLYING THE EVIDENCE IN OUR POLICY IN ADDITION TO ASSESSING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM COSTS AND SAVINGS THAT TELEHEALTH BRINGS WE NEED TO ASSESS OUR TELEHEALTH SYSTEMS ON MEASURES OF EQUITABLE ACCESS. INCLUDING A REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURES ARE WILL NEED TO EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO MEASURING REPORTING AND IMPROVING QUALITY AND OF COURSE WE NEED TO MINIMIZE INAPPROPRIATE UTILIZATION- I WILL SAY THAT AS A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR- AGAIN SERVING THESE POPULATIONS I CAN GUARANTEE YOU I DON'T HAVE EXTRA TIME TO WHO. HAS SOME VISITS WE'RE JUST YOU KNOW- TO CHECK IN ON HOW PATIENTS ARE- BUT AS- ALSO. NO LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE SERVICES CAN BRIDGE THE LINGUISTIC AND CULTURAL GAPS THAT LIMITED ENGLISH- PATIENT POPULATIONS BASED IN THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH THEIR PROVIDERS WE WILL NEED TO WHOLEHEARTEDLY COMMIT TO BUILDING UP A LANGUAGE CAPABLE WORKFORCE- AND THEN YOU KNOW IN CLOSING. AS WE DEPLOY POLICY AROUND TELEHEALTH SERVICE USE WE CAN HELP ADDRESS AND CAREFULLY AVOID FURTHER CONTRIBUTING TO AN EQUITIES WITHIN OUR ERA OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY BY ENSURING PAYMENT PARITY FOR VIRTUAL VISITS ACROSS PAYERS. REQUIRING EQUITABLE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE USE OF TELEPHONE TO DELIVER SERVICES IN REQUIRING THAT OUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS ARE INCLUSIVE OF THE VERY POPULATIONS THAT THEY'RE INTENDED TO SERVE THAT'S WHERE REGULATORY POLICY CAN PROMOTE HIGH VALUE AND EFFECTIVE CARE THAT WILL ULTIMATELY- DRIVE. DOWN COSTS NEXT LINE. SO MY REFERENCE NEXT LINE TO MAKE MEN'S. AND THAT'S IT NEXT SLIDE. VERY GOOD WELL THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR NAYEF- IT TO BE A QUESTIONS THE FIGURE. NO JUST THE FACT THAT- YOU KNOW COVERED REALLY BROUGHT ALL THESE INEQUITIES RIGHT TO THE SERVICE FOR TELEPHONE HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND- WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL OPTIONS AVAILABLE AND- I THINK WITH THE TELEPHONE PIECES THERE- WE TAKE THAT AWAY THEN IT'S INEQUITABLE FOR SO MANY OF OUR- CONSTITUENTS SO. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PRESENTATIONS WHILE THE- YES THANK YOU- AND I AM JUST CURIOUS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE A DOCTOR AND I A IS. IS THERE AN ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE YOU THINK WE NEED ON YOU KNOW TELEHEALTH TELEPHONE COVERAGE. OR DO YOU THINK WE KNOW ENOUGH THERE'S ENOUGH OUT THERE TO MAKE OUR POLICY DECISIONS MORE PERMANENT. YOU KNOW AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION- YOU KNOW AND KIND OF TYING THIS TO AN EARLIER QUESTION ABOUT HOW MUCH RESEARCH THERE IS IN PRIMARY CARE AND HOW MUCH OF ADOPTION THERE IS IN PRIMARY CARE. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS AS WAS MENTIONED AS THERE WAS A SLOW ADOPTION- IN PRIMARY CARE TO TELEHEALTH. AND SO THERE IS DEFINITELY MORE RESEARCH THAT IS GOING TO BE- FORTHCOMING AND THAT ALREADY HAS STARTED TO COME OUT JUST- AND THIS WEEK THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN BOARD OF FAMILY MEDICINE- PRODUCED. A SUPPLEMENT THAT HAS A NUMBER OF STUDIES AND- AND SO THERE IS. MORE DATA THAT IS FORTHCOMING- THOUGH YOU KNOW AT FROM- ANECDOTALLY I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN THESE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS- THAT IS THE UNFORTUNATE- REALITY THAT OUR PATIENTS- I FACED NOT ONLY. YOU KNOW ONE ON THERE- SIDE BUT ALSO ON THE PROVIDER SIDE AND SO AT THE VERY LEAST AS I WAS SAYING IN THEM IN THE DURING THE TIME THAT WE ARE BUILDING OUT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE- THIS THE- TELEPHONE THE ONLY- ENCOUNTERS ARE GOING TO BE NECESSARY IT- IT IS. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE. HOW YOU CANNOT. REMOVE THOSE- REMOVE PAYMENT FOR THOSE AND EXPECT FOR- PATIENTS TO- NOT FURTHER FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. NO AND I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THAT NIGHT AND I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THAT SO. I'M CURIOUS FROM FOR. IN THE COMMERCIAL COVERAGE- WHY WHY SHOULD STATE LOG DICTATE A MINIMUM PAYMENT AMOUNT FOR TELEPHONE VISITS WE DON'T NORMALLY SET PAYMENT AMOUNTS IN STATUTE SO- THAT IN THAT IT PROVIDES A PAYMENT FLOOR. DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THE- YOU KNOW IT'S- THE IDEA IS THAT YOU ARE PREVENTING THE POSSIBILITY- THAT. THESE VISITS ARE GOING TO BE- ONE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE- AS THE COST SHIFTING OVER TO- THE PATIENT- AND THAT. IF THERE IS NOT THAT PROTECTION OF THESE- VIRTUAL VISITS WHICH IN FACT- HAVE ADVOCATE CAN PROVIDE THAT EQUAL CARE- THEN YOU ARE MINIMIZING THAT ABILITY FOR PATIENTS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THEM- AND READ THAT REALLY IS THE KEY AND- YOU KNOW. THAT STANDARDIZATION IS IMPORTANT SO THAT WE ARE NOT CREATING A MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS. SO YOU WOULD ADVOCATE FOR A PAYMENT- AMOUNT IN STATUTE. NUMBER OF PAYMENT AMOUNT IN STATUTE MORE SO THE STANDARDIZATION OF THE EQUAL PARITY TO WHATEVER- ALREADY KIND OF CONTRACTED- VISIT- PAYMENT IS- FOR AN EQUAL VISIT SO RIGHT NOW- WE HAVE TRANSITIONED OVER TO TIME BASED BILLING AND IF THE CARE THAT IS PROVIDED- IS EQUAL AND- IS SIMILAR IN TIME THEN YOU THAT IS THAT THAT KIND OF- MINIMUM REQUIREMENT WOULD BE THAT THAT. WOULD BE THE MINIMUM REIMBURSEMENT. THANK YOU- SO- IF I'M A PATIENT AND JUST HAD SURGERY OR GOT LAB RESULTS AND I CALL MY DOCTOR WITH THE QUESTION AND- DOCTOR CALLS BACK TO CHECK ON ME WOULD YOU WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT SHOULD BE A BILLABLE ENCOUNTER. YOU KNOW THERE ARE CERTAIN SCENARIOS JUST- HAS OF TOMATO WAS- MENTIONING THAT ARE PART OF- ENCOUNTERS THAT WE ARE ALREADY. HAVING SO FOR EXAMPLE- WE- HAVE A PATIENT A COMPLICATION JUST AS YOU SAID WE HAVE TO- AND SPEAK TO THE SPECIALIST WE HAVE TO CALL THEM BACK WITH LAB RESULTS ALL OF THAT. IS BEING INCORPORATED INTO THE TIME THAT IS SPENT ON THAT- GIVEN ENCOUNTER SO IT'S NOT A SEPARATE BILLABLE ENCOUNTER IT'S THAT IT'S BEING INCORPORATED- AND ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE LARGER AND COUNTER. SO WHICH WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR SORT OF CAPITATED OR WHOLE PERSON CARE MODEL BUT NOT NECESSARILY IN WHAT I WAS GETTING AT IS A IS A IN SOMEONE IN A FEE FOR SERVICE ATMOSPHERE WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT A BILLABLE ENCOUNTER. AND SO KIND OF THE PART OF THE COMPLEXITY WAY THINKING ABOUT- VALUE BASED PAYMENT IS THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET- IF DESIGNED WELL- THESE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS ARE CAPABLE OF DRIVING COST SAVINGS AND VALUE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LONG TERM- BUT YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT LANDSCAPING CLUES MANY UNDER PERFORMING MODELS WHICH HAVE FAILED TO PRODUCE THAT DESIRED PRACTICE- TRANSFORMATION. AND YOU KNOW IT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULD ABANDON VALUE BASED PAYMENT JUST THAT WE ARE NOT YET THERE AND- SO THIS IS- WHY IN THE INTERIM WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE- MEET PATIENTS WHERE THEIR ACT- ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR PROVIDERS IN. THE IN THE MODALITIES THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM- WHILE WE ARE IN THE LONG TERM THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN- APPLY A VALUE BASED. PAYMENT SYSTEM. SO THEY ARE THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER- DOCTOR MAROTTA- SAID THAT HE THOUGHT THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE. TELEPHONE SHOULD BE TELEPHONE SERVICES SHOULD SHOULD HAVE SORT OF KIND OF A SUNSET NECESSARILY- AND MAYBE A RE EVALUATION AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS- HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT. I THINK THAT THAT'S A REASONABLE APPROACH BUT AGAIN I THINK YOU ALWAYSHAVE TO CONSIDER AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE IS GOING TO BE A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION- THAT ULTIMATELY WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO- THE THOSE VIRTUAL VISITS THAT WE WOULD LOVE FOR ALL OF OUR PATIENTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO YOU. AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER AND THAT- NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR- INCLUDING FOR THE LONG TERM- AND SO- YOU KNOW IT WE IT WOULD BE- YOU KNOW NAIVE. TO SAY THAT EVENTUALLY WE WILL GET TO THAT POINT- WE MAY BE ABLE TO GET TO THAT POINT BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE- TIME AND SO- TO BE ABLE TO PREDICT THAT- SUNSET DATE YOU KNOW WITH SOMETHING LIKE TWO YEARS. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S- GONNA BE HARD PRESSED TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHEREWE'RE GOING TO BE YEAH IN THOSE. TWO YEARS- YOU KNOW AS WE KNOW THESE CHANGES ARE AT THE INFRASTRUCTURE LEVEL CHANGES- TAKE A LOT OF TIME- AND SO. YOU KNOW THINGS THAT W CAN DO ON HAD HE- PATIENT SIDE TO MINIMIZE- FOR EXAMPLE AT THE OVER UTILIZATION AND THAT- THE CONCERNS HAVE- HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE PHONE VISITS SO- THINKING ABOUT- HAVING AND THE- AMBULATORY TRIAGE. ALGORITHMS WHERE YOU CAN- YOU KNOW DESIGNATE WHAT TYPE OF VISITS CAN GO INTO- VIRTUAL VISITS PHONE VISITS WHAT PATIENTS NEED TO BE SEEN AND PERSON AND SO- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S- THINKING ABOUT THE SYSTEM MORE BROADLY- AND- ACCOUNTING FOR THE FACT THAT AGAIN SOME PATIENTS- YOU KNOW VIRTUAL. VISITS WILL NEVER BE AN OPTION. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU MUCH AND I YOU KNOW I COMPLETELY RECOGNIZE THAT I'D AT THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TAKE AWAY THE ONLY MODALITY SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO. TO HAVE A VISIT- AND I RECOGNIZE THE- THE HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH TRYING TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY. HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE FOR EVERYBODY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF A VIDEO VISIT OR OR SOME OTHER- TYPE OF MODALITY THERE. AND EVEN ONCE YOU GET TO THAT POINT THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT OR IN THE CASE OF OLDER PATIENTS. WHO MAY NOT. UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY OR HAVE DEMENTIA OR OTHER OTHER HEARING ISSUES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO- SO. THAT'S THERE'S A LOT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT A LOT TO CONSIDER HERE- AND- I JUST IN MY OWN MIND HI I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME. CONSIDERING THAT THERE IS PARITY BETWEEN THE TELEPHONE VISIT AND ITALO TELE TELE- A VIDEO CONFERENCING VISIT. THOSE IN MY OWN MIND DON'T DON'T. THEY'RE NOT EQUITABLE AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH THE PAYMENT ISSUE HERE BECAUSE I IT'S IT IS. IT IS A VERY THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND EVEN- MR CORBETT- IN HIS CHART TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE VALUE OF THE SOME OF THIS IS SOMEONE IS A LITTLE BIT INCONCLUSIVE AND- BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A LOT OF EVIDENCE OUT THERE SO. BUT I WOULD BE CLEAR I DON'T I'M NOT TRYING TO CUT AND WANT TO CUT PEOPLE OFF BUT THAT'S THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE. BUT I DO HAVE THIS YEAR YOU KNOW IT'S HARD FOR ME IN MY OWN MIND TO JUSTIFY IT AS PARITY- PARITY MEANS. THAT THEY'RE EQUAL. IN ANY CASE. ABSOLUTELY AND I AM- IT IS A VERY REAL CONCERN SO FOR EXAMPLE THE- EXAMPLE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP ABOUT- TO PEDIATRIC VISIT AND DOING FOR AT AN EXAM FOR ORTEGA'S MEDIA YOU CAN EXAMINE IT. BABIES YEARS VIA VIDEO IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE SO YOU KNOW PATIENT NEEDS TO BE SEEN AND PERCENT SO OF COURSE THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE PARITY BETWEEN ALLEN AND ACUTE CARE VISIT FOR- RULE OUT OF TIGHTEST MEDIA- AND IT OVER VIDEO OR PHONE- BIRTHDAYS IN PERSON. HOWEVER YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CONTEXT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IN TERMS OF CHRONIC CARE MANAGEMENT AND EXAMINE THE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE. THAT DIABETES IS- PATIENTS RIGHT SO- WE CAN ABSOLUTELY DO AND PROVIDE THE SAME EXACT CARE THE SAME LEVEL OF CARE THAT THE- AT. THE SAME LEVEL EXPERTISE THE SAME LEVEL OF TIME VIA A VIRTUAL VISIT AS WE WOULD. THE PHONE VISIT AND- YOU KNOW PHYSICIANS- ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO APPLY THOSE TYPES OF- YOU KNOW SELF SELECTION A LITTLE BIT- PATIENTS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO APPLY THAT FROM THE BEGINNING AND THAT'S WHY I THINK WE NEED TO INCORPORATE THINGS LIKE ALGORITHMS THAT ARE- GOING TO BE- NOT JUST BLANK ALGORITHMS FOR ALL BUT REALLY BETTER TAILORED TO A PATIENT PRACTICE. AND THAT ARE TAILORED TO A PATIENT POPULATION- AND SO THAT'S WHAT I WAS KIND OF GETTING AT IN TERMS OF NEEDING TO REALLY THINK ABOUT YOUR PATIENT POPULATION- WITH YOU KNOW AND CENTERING WHAT WE CALL IT AND- CRITICAL RACE THEORY- CENTERING AT THE MARGIN SO THAT WE ARE NOT- EXCLUDING. THOSE AT THE MARGINS. GREAT WELL THANK YOU KNOW MISS GADKARI HAD A QUICK IF I JUST SEMANTIC BE- I. RECENTLY HAD WAS APPROACH BY AGRA. BUSINESS AND OF DAVE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEIR PREVENTATIVE HEALTHCARE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES WHICH IS A LOT IN THE FARM FARMING WORLD. AND THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY SET UP AN OFFICE SPACE ON THEIR SITE SO SOMEBODY NEEDS TO DO A HEALTH CARE TELEHEALTH MEDICINE CALL ONSITE. DURING WORK HOURS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE. AND THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH AND- THAT REALLY GET YOU KNOW GIVES ME CHILLS TO THINK WHAT WE'RE OUR NEW NORMAL. AND THE BE ABLE TO- HAVE YOUR HEALTH CARE TAKING CARE OF MAYBE ON SITE AND MAYBE IF YOU HAVE TO GO INTO THE DOCTOR BUT- FOR PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE I THINK THAT. IT'S JUST BEEN A REALLY HELP A LOT OF THESE BUSINESSES IF THEY WERE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ON SITE THEY HAVE THE COMPUTER THEY'VE GOT THE INTERNET KIND CONNECTIVITY. SO I JUST THINK SO MANY PEOPLE WE LOOKING OUTSIDE THE BOX AND SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE. AND IT'S ALL FARMERS THAT ARE THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX OF HOW CAN THEY HELP OUR FARMWORKERS ARE- YOU KNOW ONLINE- EMPLOYEES SO. A THERE'S SO MUCH ROOM GROWTH. AND SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION DID A GREAT JOB. THANK YOU WATSON GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH DR NAYEF REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE MOVE ON TO OUR LAST PANEL TO SPEAKERS- FIRST WE HAVE DOCTOR WILL LIFE BORN DIRECTOR WILL LIE FOR NEXT WHAT WE CAN PROMOTED TO DR FOOD LIKE I GUESS A DIRECTOR WILL LIGHT BORN WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND J. C. COOPER WHO IS THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR I'LL SPEAK ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S RECENTLY RELEASED TELL A HOTEL HEALTH POLICY. SO TORNADO. DOCTOR WORKS WITH MEMBERS- WELL LIKE INSTANCE- I'M GOING TO BE VERY BRIEF AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE SCHOOL FOR. ALL THE DEPARTMENTS AS YOU KNOW HAS PROPOSED A TELEHEALTH POLICY COMPANY TRAILER BILL TO CONTINUE MOST OF THE CURRENT FLEXIBILITIES FOLLOWING THE END OF THE COLD. PUBLIC. HEALTH EMERGENCY. OUR GOAL HAS BEEN CAP. ON THE VALUE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE- OF TOTAL. KERR DURING EMERGENCE. THE INCREASED TAX. TELEHEALTH WAS MADE. WELL THE SAME TIME TO OUR FOR. ON THE OF WELL NOW YOU BASED PAYMENTS. HEALTH EQUITY AND- HEALTH MATTERS. OR PROPOSAL HOST THE ON SCHOOL. AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE ITS HER ROOM FOR EXT. HAS ALTERED PAYMENT MODELS WILL DEVELOP OR CLINIC PART. SO WITH THAT LET ME TURN IT OVER TO. JC COOPER WALKING THE DETAILS OF THE POLICY GREAT THANK YOU DIRECTOR. GOOD AFTERNOON- SO IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES GREATLY EXPANDED OUR A TELEHEALTH- POLICY- WE ENGAGED WITH AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF STAKEHOLDERS PUBLIC COMMENT TO INFORM THAT POLICY REFINEMENT- AND IT WAS ROLLED OUT- IN BOTH FEE FOR SERVICE AND MANAGED CARE. ON IN YOU HAD SEEN SOME INCREASE IN- TELEHEALTH PRIOR TO THAT- HOWEVER BASED ON ALL OF THE DATA PRESENTED TODAY AND PRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND- DH YES QUICKLY IMPLEMENTED. A NUMBER OF FLEXIBILITIES AROUND TELEHEALTH ADD MANY NO WOULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT TODAY- FOR CERTAIN PARTS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS YOU COULD RECEIVE. A CARE FROM A POSITION I'M MORE CLINICAL MEMBERS I'M JUST TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE TEMPORARY POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FLEXIBILITY THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE DURING THE CALL THE- NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY I THINK PEOPLE ARE TRACKING THAT. YOU SAID XP VIEW FOR PROVIDERS TO RENDER. ALL APPLICABLE MEDIC HOUSE ARE VERSES THAT CAN BE APPROPRIATELY PROVIDED D. AS VIA TELEHEALTH MODALITIES WAS PUT IN PLACE- INCLUDING HISTORICALLY A NOT IDENTIFIED OR REGULARLY PROVIDED VIA TELEHEALTH- IN AREAS SUCH AS HOME COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY OR ELLIE A SERVICES AND ARE TARGETED CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES SO THERE WAS A GREAT EXPANSION OF CROSSED ALL DELIVERY SYSTEMS- DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. ADDITIONALLY BE ALLOWED TELEHEALTH MODALITIES TO BE PROVIDED FOR NEW AND ESTABLISHED PATIENT A DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. ALLOWED MANY COVERED SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED VIA TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY A WIDESPREAD POLICY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ARE WE ALLOWED PER PAYMENT PARITY BETWEEN IN PERSON FACE TO FACE SYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH AS WELL AS TELEPHONIC AUDIO I'M ONLY DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WHICH INCLUDED. AT UACS AND RURAL HEALTH CLINICS BOTH IN MANAGED CARE AND BE FOR SERVICE. WE WAIT THE SITE LIMITATIONS FOR BOTH PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS- FOR EDU AGENCIES IN RURAL HEALTH CLINICS I WOULD ALLOW THE PROVIDER OR THE BENEFICIARY TO BE IN LOCATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE CLINIC- AND OR THEIR HOME RESPECTIVELY. AND THEN LASTLY I WE IMPLEMENTED- AND ALLOWED FOR THE EXPANDED ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH. VIA THE GOOD FAITH EXEMPTIONS AND UP FEDERAL FLEXIBILITY IS FROM THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS REGARDING- ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITIES ON HIT THE REQUIREMENTS DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. I WE SAW SIGNIFICANT INCREASES OF UTILIZATION A REGARDING TELEHEALTH- IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN YOU HAD ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE VISITS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BENEFICIARIES. RECEIVING TELEHEALTH I'M IN IN TWENTY TWENTY IF YOU WILL CLOSER TO YOU- NINETY ARE SORRY HUNDRED THOUSAND. EACH GIVEN MONTH- WE DID SEE HIGHER UTILIZATION OF TELEHEALTH AMONG FEMALE- WE ALSO SAW THE HIGHEST UTILIZATION AROUND EIGHTEEN TO SIXTY FOUR YEAR OLD. I'M IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER UTILIZATION IN MANAGED CARE VERSES ARE FEE FOR SERVICE ENVIRONMENT. OF FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD SIX THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN MANAGED CARE VERSUS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO IN P. FOR SERVICE. A FEW OTHER THINGS REGARDING UTILIZATION OF FOR OUR OVERALL AND UTILIZATION OF TELEHEALTH FOR NON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. VISITS WE SAW A. THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT- IN. OF FOUR SORRY FOR BEING HEALTH JUST TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE THIS IS COME UP A LOT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GIVE YOU SOME STAFF ON THAT. I DURING 202038% OF NON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH VISITS A WARRANT TELEHEALTH VERSUS 0% IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. 51% FOR MILD TO MODERATE- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND TWENTY TWENTY VERSES 1% TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND 27% OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH IN TWENTY TWENTY VERSUS ZERO IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. SO YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT THERE WAS A GREAT EXPANSION BOTH IN B. I'M NOT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AS WELL AS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH DURING PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. BUT STILL SEEING CLEARLY THAT A LARGE NUMBER PROVIDERS DID NOT UTILIZE ON TELEHEALTH SERVICES. DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY A TIME PERIOD AND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. I'M SO DH THE AIRPORT A PROPOSAL WHICH WERE WALKING THROUGH TODAY. WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE RECOMMENDATION- IS BOTH REASONABLE AND BALANCED IN TERMS OF PROMOTING APPROPRIATE STANDARDS OF KERR. PROVIDING ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE SERVICES- HELPING TO ADVANCE EQUITY AND AVAILABLE AVAILABILITY OF MULTIPLE MODALITIES OF TELEHEALTH ACROSS MULTIPLE DELIVERY SYSTEMS- THIS ALL BEING DONE BY MAINTAINING BENEFICIARY CHOICE. PRESERVING PROVIDER FLEXIBILITY I WITHIN THE PROPOSAL AND PROTECTING INTEGRITY OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM BOTH FROM A QUALITY AND A FISCAL PERSPECTIVE. WE TOOK IN A NUMBER OF PIECES AND OUTLINED SOME GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR OURSELVES AS WE PUT FORWARD THE PROPOSAL INCLUDING EQUITY ACCESS STANDARD OF CARE PATIENT CHOICE CONFIDENTIALITY STEWARDSHIP AND PAYMENT APPROPRIATENESS. SO NOW I WILL GO OVER OUR RECOMMENDED- POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TELEHEALTHIN MEDIC CAL- AFTER THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ONE THING I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT HERE IS THAT OUR PROPOSAL HAS A PROPOSED EFFECTIVE DATES FOR THESE CHANGES OF JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. HOWEVER THAT IS FROM THE FEDERAL APPROVAL AND WITHIN OUR A STATE PLAN AS YOU GET THEIR WAIVERS WITHIN- APPROVALS WITH CMS HOWEVER ALL- TELEHEALTH FLEXIBILITIES THAT HAD BEEN ENACTED THROUGH THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WOULD CONTINUE TO HELP THE END OF THE PUBLIC. HEALTH EMERGENCY WHICH IS CURRENTLY SLOTTED UP FOR DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS CURRENTLY ANNOUNCED BY THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. IN SO- THOSE WOULD EXTEND UNTIL THAT TIME I'M HOWEVER WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO INFORM PROVIDERS PLANS AND OTHERS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE AT THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY SO THEY CAN PLAN ACCORDINGLY THAT WE HAVE ALL APPROVALS IN PLACE BY THAT TIME AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE STILL RECOMMENDED THE JULY ONE START DATE- BERMAN APPROVAL POINT OF VIEW NOT TAKING AWAY THE FLEXIBILITIES. ALLOTTED DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. SO NOW WALK THROUGH THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE ACS IS PUTTING FORWARD- WE ARE RECOMMENDING TO ALLOW FQHCS AND RURAL HEALTH CLINIC PROVIDERS TO ESTABLISH NEW PATIENT- LOCATED WITHIN- IT'S FEDERALLY DESIGNATED SERVICE AREA THROUGH SYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH. PRIOR TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT IS NOT SOMETHING FQHCS. ARE COULD DO. WE ARE RECORD TO ME PERMANENT THE ROOM OF THE SITE LIMITATIONS FOR FQHCS AND RURAL HEALTH CLINICS. OF FOR EXAMPLE ALLOWING THE PROVIDER- TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE BENEFICIARY. AND THE BENEFICIARY'S HOME OR PROVIDER OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICE SPACE- WE ARE EXPANDING SYNCHRONOUS AND ASYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH SERVICES TO NINETEEN FIFTEEN C. WAIVERS. FOR THE CHART- TCM PROGRAM AND ELLIE A BOB PROGRAM. WE ARE RECOMMENDING ADDING SYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH IN TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY THE STATE PLAN DRUG MEDI CAL. WE ARE PROPOSING TO REQUIRE PAYMENT PARITY BETWEEN IN PERSON FACE TO FACE VISITS AND SYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH MODALITIES- WINDOWS AS SERVICES OF COURSE MEET ALL OF THE ASSOCIATED REQUIREMENTS WITH THE UNDERLYING BUILDING CODES BEING USED. THIS WOULD INCLUDE FOR FQHCS ESSENTIALLY ALLOWING THE FQHC TO BE PAID THEIR PPS RATE FOR BOTH THE IN PERSON OR THE SYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH- HE WOULD BE REQUIRED IN BOTH FEE FOR SERVICE AND MAIN MANAGED CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS UNLESS OF COURSE THE MANAGED CARE PLAN AND A NETWORK PROVIDER MUTUALLY AGREED TO A SEPARATE REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY. WE ALSO ARE PROPOSING TO EXPAND THE USE OF TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY SERVICES ON THAT IS ONE THING THAT I THINK SOME PEOPLE HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD REGARDING THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL WE ARE PROPOSING- TO ALLOW FOR TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY SERVICES AS WELL AS VIRTUAL COMMUNICATION SERVICES. HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT RECOMMENDING THAT WE PAID. OFF FOR THOSE SERVICES WE DO THINK THEY SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO A SEPARATE FEE SCHEDULE- IN THAT ARE THERE FOR WOULD NOT BE BILLABLE BY FQHCS. DH CS CONSULTED WITH CMS REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL- IT IS A BILLABLE PROVIDER PROVIDE SERVICES WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY THE PPS RATE FOR AT UACS AND RURAL HEALTH CLINICS. AND SENT OUR PROPOSAL RECOMMENDS THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE PAYMENT PARITY FOR TELEPHONIC OD- ARE YOU ONLY SERVICES. WE HAVE NOT RECOMMENDED TO IMPLEMENT AND ACTUALLY SEE THAT THIS TIME. HOWEVERI WOULD KNOW THAT WE WOULD DEFINITELY WORK WITH FQHCS THAT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODOLOGY TO ALLOW FOR THAT AS WE CONTINUE THAT POLICY WORK- AND LASTLY WE DO PROPOSED AND THAT THE- WE WOULD CONTINUE. TO PROVIDE TELEHEALTH SERVICES IN THE TCM PROGRAM ELLIE A BOP- HOWEVER WOULD JUST KNOW SINCE THEY ARE A COST BASED REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY AND THAT IS HOW WE WOULD SET THE PAYMENT RATES ARE CONTINUOUSLY. WITHIN THOSE SERVICES. I TO BE CLEAR THE AGE IS WRECK. THE CONTINUE. OF THE FOLLOWING- TEMPORARY CODE NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES- THAT INCLUDE PAYING A TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY MODALITIES AS A BILLABLE VISIT FOR FQHCS REIMBURSED AT THE PPS RATE- A TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY MODALITIES. I WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE USED TO ESTABLISH A NEW PATIENT- WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THAT ONLY BE USED FOR ESTABLISHED PATIENTS WERE THERE'S ALREADY A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PROVIDER. AND THE PATIENT THEMSELVES- WE ALSO ARE RECOMMENDING THAT PAYMENT PARITY HAS MENTIONED FOR TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY MODALITIES AND VIRTUAL COMMUNICATIONS- BE SUBJECT TO A SEPARATE- FEE SCHEDULE. AND THEN LASTLY JUST WANT TO CLARIFY MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE TRACKING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- PROVIDE FOR THE- POLICIES FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR TRIBAL AT SIX THIRTY A. CLINICS AND SO WE WOULD BE REVERTING BACK. I DO WHATEVER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DEBT FOR POLICIES THERE HOWEVER ANY- TRIBAL PARTNERS WHO ARE CONVERTING TO THE TRIBAL FQHCS WHICH RECENTLY WAS APPROVED BY CMS. I WOULD BE SUBJECT TO WHATEVER RULES ARE APPLICABLE TO FQHCS AND RURAL. HEALTH CLINICS WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL. IN THE DEPARTMENT PROPOSAL A CHARGE THAT BREAKS DOWN. CODE NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- PROPOSED- IN THIS PROPOSAL BY DELIVERY SYSTEM IN BY EACH OF THE TELEHEALTH MODALITIES I AM NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THAT BUT IT IS THE REFERENCE FOR PEOPLE WHO. ARE INTERESTED IN THE DETAILS ACROSS THE DELIVERY SYSTEM I'M AND THEN JUST WOULD NOTE- THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH THAT. THE STATE WOULD NEED TO DO TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROPOSAL AND INCLUDING ON THE BUDGET PROPOSAL BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. FOR CONSIDERATION REGARDING THE ADDITION OF REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING OF FOR EXAMPLE WE DID NOT EXPAND REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE. AND MEDICARE THAT IS A PROPOSAL UP FOR CONSIDERATION- WE WILL HAVE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL WE WOULD- IMPLEMENT VARIOUS WAIVER STATE PLANS THAT ARE. THE MOST NOTABLE I THINK GIVEN THAT THERE IS STILL CONFLICTING RESEARCH- AND- INFORMATION COMING IN EVEN AS PRESENTED TO THIS COMMITTEE TODAY I'M YES YES IS VERY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS POLICY. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS AS WE CONTINUE TO THAT THAT- PROPOSAL MOVING FORWARD AND LOOK FORWARD TO OTHERS CONVERSATIONS UP. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISASAGI SURE YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU GAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THAT THEN. I WISH I HAD LITTLE CHECKMARK IN FRONT OF THESE YOURSELF. SO BEAR WITH ME HERE YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED THIS BUT I DO WANT TO ADDRESS TWO QUESTIONS I'VE ASKED. SO THE- YOU KNOW TODAY THE DIGITAL DIVIDE CONTINUES TO BE TOO GREAT IMPACT IN ALL FACETS OF LIFE INCLUDING HEALTH CARE. THIS IS WHY IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION CREATE TELEHEALTH POLICIES THAT SUPPORT CARE FOR ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS INCLUDING THOSE WITHOUT RELIABLE BROADBAND A PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY. THAT IS OUT OF REACH FOR THEIR INCOME LEVEL. WITH THIS IN MIND CAN THE ADMINISTRATION EXPLAINED THE REASONING BEHIND REMOVING AUDIO ONLY CARE THE SYNCHRONOUS CARE AND REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING. SO JUST TO CLARIFY THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING THAT WE WOULD PAY FOR AS WE DO TODAY SYNCHRONOUS ASYNCHRONOUS VIRTUAL COMMUNICATION- AS WELL AS REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING AND TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY THOSE ARE ALL CURRENTLY WITHIN OUR PROPOSAL- AND WE ARE RECOMMENDING TO CONTINUE THOSE. HOWEVER I WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE CLEAR IN REGARDS TO OUR PROPOSALS AROUND WHERE WE WOULD HAVE PAYMENT PARITY SO WE ARE RECOMMENDING PAYMENT PARITY FOR IN PERSON AND- SYNCHRONOUS- TELEHEALTH MODALITIES AND WE ARE RECOMMENDING A DIFFERENT FEE SCHEDULE- FOR ASYNCHRONOUS. OR TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY FOR PERSONAL COMMUNICATION AND FOR REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING SO WE ARE ALLOWING THOSE OF THE BENEFITS THOSE ARE PROPOSED IN OUR PROPOSAL- HOWEVER WE ARE RECOMMENDING- AS THE VARIATION IN THE PAYMENT PARITY THE ONE EXCEPTION TO THAT IS THE TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY FOR FQHCS AND RURAL HEALTH CLINICS. GIVEN SOME OF THE COMPLEXITY COMPLICATED KIND OF FEDERAL RULES AROUND HOW WE PAY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND WHERE WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY PARITY AT. I AM SITTING HERE THINKING WE'RE GOING TO ADD ANOTHER DIFFICULTY YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO. IF YOU'RE THIS YOU CAN DO THIS I JUST FEEL LIKE IT CAN WE JUST MAKE THIS REAL SIMPLE AND GET PEOPLE PAID BUT ANYWAY I CLEAN. YOUR IT'S YOUR JOB NOT MY JOB. AND UNDER THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THE STATE SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR RESPONDING QUICKLY TO GUARANTEE NEXUS- CONTINUED UNDER EXTRAORDINARY CONDITIONS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. HOWEVER THIS PROPOSAL CREATES A NEW DIVIDE WITHIN MEDIC CL- THAT WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT COMMUNITIES TO GET THEIR CARE THROUGH FQHCS IN THE MINISTRATION DRESSED THE CONCERNS OF INEQUITY. THERE WILL BE CREATED BY REMOVING TELEPHONIC CARE BUT WE'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT. I WAS SO POOR AT UACS THAT IS THE ONE EXCEPTION THAT I WAS MENTIONING AND- WE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE M. S. N. B. GIVEN OUR RECOMMENDATION ON PAYMENT PARITY FOR THESE SERVICES. WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY FQHCS- AT PAYMENT PARITY FOR A TELEPHONIC AUDIO ONLY VISIT WHEN BUILT. A BY A BILLABLE PROVIDER- IN GIVEN THE AVERAGE- REIMBURSEMENT FOR FQHC THERE'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER VISIT. I'M IN THERE ISN'T SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH IN REGARDS TO YOU- OUTCOME AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW WE ARE STRONGLY RECOMMENDING FROM A PAYMENT PARITY IN A PAYMENT APPROPRIATENESS. ON THE DAY NOT BE PAID AT THE SAME RATE THAT'S WHY WE DID NOT PUT THAT FORWARD IN OUR RECOMMENDATION. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU IT'S- IT'S RARE THAT I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION BECAUSE YOU WERE VERY THOROUGH MISS COOPER. IN AND YOU ANTICIPATED A LOT OF A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT I- I HAD AN INTEREST IN SO- J. RICHARD VERY MUCH THE THOUGHT YOU'VE GIVEN THIS AND- THE PRESENTATION TODAY. AND THANK YOU AND TO ALSO THANK YOU TO DIRECTOR LIKE FORM MUCH APPRECIATED. THANK YOU FOR PLEASURE. OKAY I JUST WANT TO SAY AT THIS POINT I WANT TO THANK OUR WITNESSES FOR THEIR PRESENTATIONS- BEFORE WE GO TO THE PHONE LINES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT I'D LIKE TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS BUT I'D LIKE TO GIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KERR AGUIAR-CURRY AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO BEFORE RIGHT NOW. OKAY OKAY- FIRST OF ALL I THINK WE WOULDN'T NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION OVER OVER THE PAYMENT PARITY FOR TELEPHONE TELEPHONE VISITS REF CASEY'S IF WE HAD AN ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODE METHODOLOGY- WE NEED. WE NEED A SMALL SPACE WEAKENED STATE LAW BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE ALSO NEED TO TWEAK IN FEDERAL LAW. TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN- YOU KNOW WE COULD CLINICS COULD PROVIDE SAME DAY VISIT TELEPHONE TELEPHONE TELEHEALTH VISITS AND USE DIFFERENT TYPES OF NON BILLABLE PROVIDERS. ALL OF THIS COULD OCCUR IF WE HAD AN ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODOLOGY. BUT THE STATE ASSOCIATION IS OPPOSED. TO MAKING THAT TWEAK SO HERE WE ARE SO IF YOU'RE UNHAPPY THAT YOU CAN'T PROVIDE A TELEPHONE SERVICES POST A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. UNDER WHAT THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSING I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR. AS TO WHY IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT ISN'T HAPPENING. WE HAD A CHANGE STATE LAW TO AUTHORIZE AN ALTERNATE PAYMENT METHODOLOGY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN IT NEEDS A SMALL TWEAK TO GET CMS APPROVAL. BUT IT NEVER SEEMS THE RIGHT YEAR. TO APPROACH AND REVISIT THE EIGHT PM DISCUSSION. INSTEAD WE KEEP BUILDING OFF OF WHAT I THINK IS A FLAWED PAYMENT MODEL- THE PPS RATES OF THE STATE PAYS FQHCS RATING FROM. SIXTY THREE DOLLARS AND SIXTY NINE CENTS A VISIT. TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY SEVEN CENTS A VISIT. THAT'S MORE THAN A MONTH THE PAINT IN THE MONTHLY PAYMENT THE STATE MAKES TO PLANS FOR ADULTS AND KIDS I DON'T THINK A PAYMENT RANGE THAT WIDE MAKES SENSE. NOW WE'RE BEING ASKED TO EXTEND THAT FLOOD PAYMENT MODEL TO TELEPHONE CALLS I SERIOUSLY QUESTION WHETHER AN AVERAGE P. P. S. RATE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY CENTS. AND A MEDIAN RATE OF TWO HUNDRED AND THREE DOLLARS AND ONE CENT IS APPROPRIATE FOR A TELEPHONE CALL. WHEN PRIVATE VENDORS DO IT FOR UNDER FIFTY DOLLARS- SECOND ON THE ISSUE OF PAYMENT PARITY FOR PRIVATE HEALTH PLANS I REALIZE I VOTED FOR THE TELEPHONE. TELL TELL HEALTH- PAYMENT. YEAH THIS IS MADE TOTAL PAY A PAYMENT PARITY BILL. LET'S CALL IT PAYMENT PARITY THIS CALL PAYMENT PARITY WHAT IT YES PAYMENT PARITY UNDER ANY OTHER NAME IS RATE SETTING. WHEN I WORKED ON SURPRISE BUILDING A BILLING- IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN I HEARDOVER AND OVER. WHY SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT SET COMMERCIAL RATES. NOW WE HAVE THOSE SAME PEOPLE ARGUING THAT THAT STATE ARGUING STATE LAW SHOULD SET MINIMUM RATES BECAUSE IT'S IN THEIR FINANCIAL INTERESTS. SO IS A LEVEL OF HYPOCRISY THERE THAT BOTHERS ME PARTICULARLY WHEN AMERICANS SPEND FAR MORE ON HEALTHCARE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD. AND ANY EFFORTS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IS CHARACTERIZED AS OUT OF BOUNDS- WITH THAT- WILL OPEN THE LINES TO PUBLIC COMMENT- WE ASK MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO KEEP THEIR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES OR LESS- WE ALSO A WILL AND CAN ACCEPT WRITTEN COMMENTS THAT ARE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE- OPERATOR- I'M GONNA SAY THE NAME. THE NUMBER ONCE AGAIN SO PEOPLE WHO HAVE. WANT TO COLIN CAN. IT SHOULD BE ON THE SCREEN. BUT I'LL SAY IT AGAIN FOR AND FOR ANYONE.

AT THE STATE'S DECISION TO TEMPORARY LIFT RESTRICTIONS ON TELEHEALTH DELIVERY HAS BEEN A GAME CHANGER. IT'S FACILITATED IN INNOVATION AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER LEVEL. BY ALLOWING OUR MEMBER HEALTH CENTERS TO PROVIDE A BILL TPS. FOR BOTH VIDEO AND AUDIO BUSINESS. HAS ALLOWED US TO REACH MORE PATIENTS WITH QUALITY SERVICE WHERE THEY ARE. OUR DATA SHOWS THAT BETWEEN MARCH FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. AND FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. 62% OF VISITS TO OUR MEMBER HEALTH CENTERS PROVIDE TELEHEALTH WITH A 57% CHOOSING PHONE VISITS AND 5% BY VIDEO. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW TELEHEALTH INCLUDING AUDIO VISITS FOR PATIENTS POST CODE. WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THAT T. H. THE ACTORS FULLY ON BOARD WITH TELEHEALTH BEEN A PERMANENT FIXTURE OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM POST CODE BUT- GIVEN THAT MANY VULNERABLE PATIENTS DO NOT HAVE THE COMFORT OR ABILITY TO DO VIDEO CALLS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU AND THAT COMES TO MIND FIFTY THREE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN LLOYD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TERRA HAPTICS AND I'M THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THE SENATE HEARING TOGETHER ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC HE TEACH REPRESENTS TWENTY ONE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS THAT INCLUDE COUNTY OWNED AND OPERATED OR AFFILIATED. SYSTEMS AND THE FIVE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL CENTERS THE MAJORITY OF THE PATIENTS THAT WE SERVE ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE INSURED AND MANY R. RANCHO WORKERS IMMIGRANTS FOR UNDER OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY CO THAT NINETEEN. OUR COMMITMENT AND TO AND TO ENROLL IN SERVING THIS LARGELY LOW INCOME PATIENT POPULATION HAS NEVER. BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT IS TODAY. HOW HAS BEEN. ESSENTIAL AND OUR SYSTEM CONNECTED WITH THEIR PATIENTS FOR MANY OF OUR SYSTEMS ROUGHLY SPECIALTY CARE VISITS CONTINUE TO BE VIRTUAL. AND FOR MANY OF OUR SYSTEMS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE VISITS ARE OVER THE PHONE. SOME EXAMPLES OF THE TYPES OF VISITS THAT ARE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL- VIRTUALLY INCLUDE CHANGING MEDICATIONS ADDRESSING CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT CONCERNS. DISCUSSION DISCUSSING PAIN MANAGEMENT AND BEHAVIOR HOW. ARE MEMBERS OF SHARED A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT BENEFITS THAT HAVE RESULTED FROM EXPANDED TELEHEALTH INCLUDING A GREATER NUMBER OF PATIENTS BEING ABLE TO MAKE THEIR APPOINTMENT. ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH PATIENTS THAT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COME INTO THE CLINIC- FOR AN IN PERSON VISIT AND MANY OTHERS. PHONE IN PARTICULAR IS A CRITICAL MODALITY FOR OUR PATIENTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE LONG AFTER THE PANDEMIC OVER. THEY CAN PHONE BUSINESS CAN BE A GOOD SUBSTITUTE FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF IN PERSON VISITS. AND WHEN THE SAME STANDARDS OF CARE ARE MET WE BELIEVE PAYMENT SHOULD BE THE SAME AS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN IN PERCENT. ALTHOUGH MANY OF OUR SYSTEMS ARE WORKING TO EXPAND VIDEO CAPABILITY ENCOURAGING PATIENT UPTAKE REMAINS CHALLENGING MANY OF OUR PATIENTS PER PER THE PHONE. BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE WITH LIMITED DATA PLANS. INTERNET ACCESS CHALLENGES AND LACK OF PRIVACY. SOMEONE HAS. BEEN A CRITICAL LINKAGE TO CARE. WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE VALUE OF TELEHEALTH OVER THE- YEAR. AND RECOGNIZE THEIR EVEN MORE TO LEARN AFTER THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND- WE CAN FULLY INTEGRATE ALL OF THESE MODALITIES WITH NO LIMIT. ON IN PERSON THAT THAT AND IF W WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE COME UP TODAY RELATED TO PHONE. WE HOPE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND THE LEGISLATURE TO CRAFT SOLUTIONS THAT HELP ACHIEVE. MANY OF OUR SHARED PRIORITIES AROUND MAINTAINING AND STRENGTHENING ACCESS TO CARE. ADVANCING OUR SHARED GOALS RELATED TO EQUITY IN REDUCING DISPARITIES. AND ADVANCING STRATEGIES AND PAYMENT MODELS THAT DEMONSTRATE VALUE FOR THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND PORT AND SHERRY. I LOVE MONITORING OUR PROGRESS SO THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE BEST PRACTICES AND LESSONS LEARNED. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND THE ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR FAMILIES OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU IN THAT LINE NINETEEN. HI MY NAME IS KAREN MOTORBIKE AND I'M CALLING ON BEHALF OF MINUTES FROM THE CLINIC THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS SERVING TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WE ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF EXPANDING TELEHEALTH INCLUDING TELEPHONIC CARE BEYOND THE CURRENT PANDEMIC. CURRENTLY OVER 60% OF OUR VISITS ARE VIRTUAL BUT NO MORE THAN 15% OF THE VIRTUAL VISITS ARE COMPLETED BY VIDEO. WE KNOW THAT HELLO HELLO THE PHYSICALLY TELEPHONIC IS THE SOLUTION TO ADDRESS. MANY EXISTING HEALTH DISPARITIES. MANY OF OUR PATIENTS. DON'T GET PAID SICK TIME FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS TAKING TIME OFF TO VISIT THE CLINIC MEANS FORFEITING INCOME. OF THE MANY OF OUR PATIENTS RELY ON TIME CONSUMING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. BEING ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE CONDITION OF THE PHONE SIX AND PRECIOUS TIME AND MONEY. AND ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE MEDICAL CARE THAT THEY NEED. HELLO NO SHOW RATE OF ONLY 4% FOR TALK ON A DIFFERENCE OF ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW WELL IT IS WORKING FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE OUR COMMUNITY HOT MAKE SURE TELEPHONIC CARE IS INCLUDED IN ANY TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK. YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT CALLER PLEASE. AND THAT COMES FROM. FIFTH FIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS JUSTIN RAN OF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR COMMITTING TO EXTEND THE TELEHEALTH FACILITIES THAT WERE ALLOWED DURING THE PANDEMIC IN THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL HOWEVER WE WERE DISAPPOINTED WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT HE BIALIK DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO ESTABLISH A PATIENT EIGHTEENTH IN A TELEHEALTH. AT HIGHLIGHTED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED AS A MESSAGE TO TREAT A PATIENT WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY FOUR IN TWENTY TWENTY THE RECKLESS GENERAL HOME IS A LOT. BIGGER THAN A WHOLE MODEL IF THE PENCIL EVIDENCE BASED MODEL FOR TELEHEALTH AND WHICH DENTAL HYGIENISTS AND ASSISTANTS GO TO COMMUNITY FIVE PROVIDE TO PROVIDE DIAGNOSTIC PREVENTATIVE AND EARLY INTERVENTION DENTAL CARE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CLUB GRADING DENTIST. REVIEWS RECORDS REMOTELY. LANGUAGE BECAUSE OF THE TO UNDERMINE UNDER MY THE EXISTING SUCCESS MEDIA PROGRAM. D. A. APPLE YOU PRESERVE NEXT DOOR AND FORMER AND AS IN A LOT. THE LITTLE TO WORKING CLOSELY. AS DEVELOP INTO SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY. THE NEXT COUPLE. AND THAT COMES MIND. EIGHT H. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS STEPHANIE FOR AND ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND HELP COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR TODAY'S HEARING. WE ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF INCREASING ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH FOR FAMILIES OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. WE APPRECIATE DHS'S PRESENTATION TODAY AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S DESIRE TO MAKE PERMANENT TELEHEALTH GRANTED DURING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AND THE RESTRICTIONS IT PLACES ON COMMUNITY CLINICS IN THE PATIENTS NAY SAYERS. WE FEEL THE PROPOSAL IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN ITS CURRENT FORM WOULD BE A MOVE AWAY FROM EQUITY AND A MOVE AWAY FROM ENSURING THAT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WHO NEED CARE THE MOST ARE ABLE TO GET IT. WE STRONGLY URGE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO RECONSIDER AND ENSURE COMMUNITY CLINICS CAN ESTABLISH PATIENTS USING ASYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH. AND BE REIMBURSED FOR AUDIO ONLY TELEHEALTH. BOTH ASYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH AND AUDIO ON THE TELEHEALTH ARE BOTH CRITICAL MODALITIES OF CARE ESPECIALLY FOR THE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO LACK ADEQUATE BROADBAND ACCESS AND COMPUTER THE VIDEO CAMERAS IN THEIR HOMES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE OUR STATE'S TELEHEALTH POLICIES. SERVE OUR POPULATIONS AND DO NOT CUT OFF COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES FROM ACCESSING CARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT CALL PLEASE. THANK YOU AND THAT COMES FROM LINE FORTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU- GOOD EVENING CHAIR WOULD IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING I'M TACKLER IS RENEE HEALTH TECHNOLOGY STRATEGIST WITH BACKGROUND AS A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER TRAUMA SURGEON CLINICAL LEADER IN HEALTH POLICY ADVISER- THERE'S NO BETTER PERSON TO TALK ABOUT TELEHEALTH POLICY THAN IS QUAN. WHO PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT FOUNDATION FOR YOUR TELEHEALTH DISCUSSION TODAY- BUT I WANTED OFFER A SMALL AMENDMENT TO HER DEFINITION OF REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING. IT MIGHT NOT BE CONTINUOUS IT COULD BE EPISODIC. THIS IS IMPORTANT AS YOU LOOK AT NEW SERVICES SOME ALREADY COVERED BY MEDICARE FOR THE PATIENT OF THE MONITORING SERVICE WHICH IS CONTINUES ON A DAILY BASIS. BUT THE DATA TRANSMITTED IS ONLY OF THE SONIC. AND A SMALL ME ONCE IT MIGHT HAVE SIGNIFICANT POLICY IMPLICATIONS IF YOU LOOK AT THE CATEGORY OF TELEHEALTH IN THE FUTURE- IN TERMS OF TELEHEALTH COMPARABILITY TO IN PERSON CLINICAL ASSESSMENT I HAVE TWO COMMENTS. FIRST WE DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA ON OUTCOMES IN HEALTHCARE GENERALLY. BECAUSE WE DON'T MEASURE AND REPORT THINGS LIKE RATES OF BREAST CANCER MORTALITY HYPERTENSIVE STROKE OR DIABETIC FOOT AMPUTATIONS. THOSE CLINICAL OUTCOMES WOULD LET US KNOW HOW WE'RE DOING BUT WE DON'T MEASURE AND REPORT THEM. INSTEAD WE MEASURE THINGS LIKE RATE OF MAMMOGRAPHY WHICH DOESN'T TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF THE STUDY OR THE RADIOLOGIST INTERPRETATION. THE RATE OF UNNECESSARY BIOPSIES ARE MISSED CANCERS ALL OF WHICH ARE CAPTURED IN BREAST CANCER MORTALITY IN AGGREGATED FORM. THE FLAG OF OUTCOME DATA LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO KNOW HOW TO LOVE COMPARES. BECAUSE OUR BASELINE QUALITY DATA IS INADEQUATE. SECOND STUDY THAT EXAMINED COMPARABILITY OF TELEHEALTH TEND TO BE DISEASE SPECIFIC CONSISTENT WITH THE CLINICAL TEST MONEY HEARD FROM DOCTORS MENTAL CORRUPTION AND I AM. AN ASSESSMENT OF A PSYCHIATRIC ISSUE MIGHT BE MORE EFFECTIVE BY TELEHEALTH AND IN PERSON. A SKIN LESION% EVALUATION MIGHT BE COMPARABLE BUT AN ASSESSMENT OF THE CUTE OF DOMINO PAIN WITHOUT AN EXAMINATION. WILL CERTAINLY BE LIMITED COMPARED TO THE TOUCH AN EXPERIENCED POLITICAL HANDS. CONSISTENT WITH YOUR WOOD STATEMENTS PAYMENT PARITY SHOULD BE BASED ON CLINICAL PARITY. ALL THAT COULD BE IS A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. SEPARATE FROM PAYMENT PARITY PAYMENT FOR TELEHEALTH SERVICES TO ENSURE ACCESS ABSOLUTELY. PAYMENT PARITY TO IMPROVE ACCESS HE WON THE SERVICES PLUS EFFECTIVE PROBABLY NOT. BECAUSE THAT COULD CREATE UNINTENDED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. THE PAYMENT PARITY DISCUSSION AND THE TELL OF EQUITY DISCUSSION MUST BE SEPARATE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE CLEARLY RELATED. AND THEN LAST PLEASE JUST MENTION BY CMA HEALTHEQUITY DOES REQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGIR TREES EIGHTY FOURTEEN TO ENSURE THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH. THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING PUBLIC INPUT- I'D BE HAPPY TO EXPAND ON THESE COMMENTS IN THE A LONGER OPPORTUNITY IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU NEXT LINE FORTY TWO. I THINK YOU CAN MEMBERS MY RETIREMENT PLAN HOW TO FIGHT THE CALIFORNIA. ENDOWMENT AGAIN CLINTON SEVEN AFFILIATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED INNOVATIVE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY APPROACHES TO CONTINUE SERVING OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS IN THE STATE INCLUDING SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS AND HOW HOW DOES NOT FORGE ABOUT A QUARTER THINKING HAD SERVICES IN THE STATE HAVE BEEN PROVIDED VIA TELEHEALTH BUT OVER HALF OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED. OF AUDIO ONLY OUR HEALTH BUT- IN SOME OF OUR- HELLO THIS IS MADE UP CIRCUIT PERCENT OF ALL THAT BUT- ENTAILS UNDER THAT BECOME ABSOLUTELY. FOR PATIENTS DO NOT HAVE RELIABLE CONNECTION. AND ARE FROM HOME PRIOR OR THE TWO CAN. AND THEREFORE CHOOSE AUDIO ONLY CARE. THROUGH TELEHEALTH CLAIM PUBLICATIONS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS A WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES LIKE BIRTH CONTROL. STI SCREENING PREGNANCY COUNSELING GENDER AFFIRMING CARE HAPPENED A LOT AGI SCREENING. WELCOME TO CONTINUE TO DEEPEN INEQUITIES WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WE CAN'T INTENTIONALLY IMPROVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL PATIENTS BY ENSURING OUR TELEHEALTH POLICY. ALLOWED FOR MEDICAL PATIENTS TO ACCESS SERVICES THROUGH TELEHEALTH APPLICATIONS. OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. YES YOU CAN CLOSE ALL IN. AND PERSONAL PULSAR ABOUT HOW NEED INTO THEIR CAL- YOU BRIDGE THAT ABOUT MEDICAL PATIENTS CONTINUE PAYMENT FOR TELL. BUT THAT. REIMBURSING ALL ONLY OR HELP THAT NEW PIECE. AND ALLOW FOR MORE RURAL MEMBER TONE WRONG INTO LITTLE SCOPE PART. LOOK FOR CONTINUE CONVERSATION THE COMMITTEES ARE ONS ABILITY TO TWO WORKING FOR MORE ACT. COMPONENTS BUDGET AND ENSURE ALL PATIENT. AND I WANT INSURANCE THEY HAVE HAVE ACCESS TO TOP SERVICES APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE NEXT PLEASE. THANK YOU AND THAT COMES FROM TWENTY NINE PLEASE AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN KATEY LEIGHTON BE HAPPY THE CHILDREN SPECIAL CARE BECAUSE- ONE STRONG SUPPORTER. TO TELL PLEXUS IS IMPLEMENTED DURING THE PANDEMIC LIKE THE PEACH YEARS OVER THE RAPID AND SUCCESSFUL SCALING UP TELEHEALTH HAS ALLOWED PEDIATRIC SUBSPECIALISTS TO REMAIN IN CLOE CONTACT WITH THEIR PATIENTS WHEN THEY NEED IT THEM OUT. IT CHILDREN YOUTH AND THEIR- TO KEEP THE POINT SCHOOL FIND CHILD OR TRAVEL TO THE HOSPITAL. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPACTFUL TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH COMPLEX HEALTH CARE NEEDS TO OFTENTIMES. HAVE MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS AND MANY TO SEE MULTIPLE SPECIALISTS TO TREAT THEIR CONDITION. WELL WE'RE INITIALLY PLEASED TO SEE THE EXPANSION OF TELEHEALTH POLICY AND PHD AT THE PROPOSAL WE DO HAVE CONCERNS BUT IT DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH AND COULD EXACERBATE DISPARITIES FOR LOW INCOME PATIENTS. PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ACCESS CHARACTER ACTUALLY USE AND HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY ARE BROAD AND- TELEHEALTH HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY AND HEALTHCARE DELIVERY ON THE ON THE PHD. BUT WE MUST ENSURE IT WORKS WELL FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF RACE ETHNICITY AGE OUR PRIMARY LANGUAGE SPOKEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND FOR HOSTING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT CALLER PLEASE. BACKUP TO MIND. ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CODY KATHY AND I'M CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE CENTRAL ACCESS HELLO. WE NEED THE LARGEST AND MOST COMPREHENSIVE TITLE PAN FEDERAL FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM PROVIDER NETWORK IN THE COUNTRY I KNOW WE ARE NETWORK INCLUDE FAMILY PLANNING PROVIDERS SB PREVENTION PARTNERS AND THE ALL COLLECTIVELY SERVE EIGHTEEN ACROSS TWENTIETH CALIFORNIA'S COUNTY. AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL HELP PROPOSAL WILL PREVENT PEOPLE FROM ACCESSING ESSENTIAL SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE BEYOND THE PANDEMIC PART OF PROVIDING QUALITY CARE FOR TIME SENSITIVE SERVICES LIKE CONTRACEPTION AND RELATED SERVICES INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO GET THE SIMPLE CHOICE WHETHER TO IN PERSON VISITS VIDEO OR AUDIO ONLY THAT THAT. I THOUGHT HELP INCREASES ACCESS TO BE VITAL SERVICES AND REDUCES BARRIERS TO CARE LIKE I'M AWAY FROM WORK FAMILY HEALTHCARE ISSUES AND CONFIDENTIALITY CONCERNS AND THE PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO ARE OFTEN EXPERIENCING BARRIERS WHICH IS WHY ONGOING COVERAGE AND PAYMENT PARITY. THE FUNNY CARE WILL HELP CREATE A MORE EQUITABLE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN OUR STATE AND PATIENT HI EXPRESSED THAT RECEIVING CARE VIA PHONE IS AN OPTION THEY NEED IT'S PAST SUMMER WE SURVEYED OVER FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA NEARLY 50% SAID THEY WOULD BE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO GET CARE USING TELEHEALTH MEN IF THEY HAD TO GO INTO A CLINIC AND THE PROPRIETOR OVERWHELMING MAJORITY SAID THEY PREFERRED BUSINESS TO TAKE PLACE OVER THE PHONE. FIRST VIDEO THEY NOTED PRIVACY EASE OF ACCESS AND LESS INTIMIDATING AS REASONS WHY THE PREFERRED TELEPHONIC AND VIRTUAL VISIT WE ALSO SURVEYED OUR PROVIDER NETWORK RESPONDENTS REPORTED THAT NEARLY 60% OF THEIR VIRTUAL SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH VISITS WERE CONDUCTED BY TELEPHONE I MAJORITY REPORTED THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR PATIENTS. ARE EXPECTED TO CHOOSE A TELEHEALTH VISIT OVER IN PERSON CARE BY APRIL OF THIS YEAR I'LL HELP REDUCE PATIENT WAIT TIME SO THEY CAN. GET THE CARE THEY WANT WHEN THEY NEED IT WHERE THEY ARE. SO THANK YOU FOR TIME AND YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THEY PUT IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT PLEASE. AND THAT COMES MIND.

AND MARK PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THE FAMILY AND ONE AGUIAR-CURRY AB THIRTY TWO ON THIS VERY ISSUE. AS WE LOOK FORWARD WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR THE PAST ELEVEN MONTHS WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE PORTION OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THAT WOULD LIFT RESTRICTIONS. FOR CLINICS TO PROVIDE VIDEO VISIT HOWEVER ANY PROPOSAL THAT ELIMINATES FQHCS ARE EACH THESE ABILITY TO PROVIDE. AUDIO ONLY. AN ASYNCHRONOUS STORE AND FORWARD CARE AND PROHIBITS CLINICS FROM PROVIDING. REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING IS NOT EQUITABLE AND WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT HEALTH CENTER PATIENTS. BY TAKING AWAY PATIENT CHOICE TO ACCESS THESE MODALITIES WHICH IS A PARTICULAR NEED TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THAT WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER- BY EXCLUDING ONE PROVIDER SETTING FROM OFFERING ALL THESE MODALITIES THAT COULD PROPEL A POST PANDEMIC MEDICAL SYSTEM WHERE PATIENTS WHO CHOOSE TO RECEIVE THEIR CARE A HEALTH CENTER. ARE OFTEN A DIFFERENT AND PERHAPS LOWER TIER OF ACCESS TO CARE AND COULD ALSO EXACERBATE THE WORKFORCE CHALLENGES THAT ALREADY EXISTED HEALTH CENTER. WE ARE ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THEIR RENEWED INTEREST. IN ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES HOWEVER AT NOTED THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ABOUT HOW THE EPM MUST BE ACHIEVED. ON THE STATE SIDE AND THE FEDERAL SIDE AND SO FAR NOT NOT THE TYPE BY ALL THE PARTIES TO COME TO A RESOLUTION SO THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING. THAT IN PLACE TODAY AND WE DO NOT HAVE A CLEAR SENSE OF TIGHTENING. HONEST EFFORTS WE WOULD ASK THAT AT THE VERY LEAST AT THE CONSIDERATION OF THE BRIDGE UNTIL WE GET TO. PM WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING YOU- THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO ACHIEVE EQUITY AND ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH FOR HEALTH CENTER PATIENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

MEDIKAL AND REALLY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO VIRTUAL CAROUSEL AND THOSE IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET WE DO BELIEVE THAT PART OF ENSURING EQUITABLE ACCESS IS AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING REIMBURSING AUDIO ONLY CALLS AT PARITY WITH VIDEO MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE VISION TECHNOLOGY OR THEY CAN'T AFFORD DATA PLANS TO SUPPORT IT. OTHERS MAY PREFERIDEA ONLY FOR THE PRIVACY IT AFFORDS PRESERVING ACCESS TO AUDIO QUALITY IS AN IMPORTANT EQUITY COMPONENT.

EVIDENCE OF THE YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IS STAGGERING I INCREASES IN SUICIDE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WERE ALREADY AT UNACCEPTABLE AND ALARMING LEVELS FOR THE PANDEMIC. AND THEY ARE NOW EVEN WORSE- WE STRONGLY SUPPORT TELEHEALTH BUT ANY SOLUTION THAT EXCLUDES REIMBURSEMENT PARITY FOR PHONE. AND THE INCLUSION OF TAX. SPECIALLY FOR YOU MENTAL HEALTH IS MISSING OF THE- WAYS WHICH YOU CAN AND CAN. TO THEIR THERAPIST COUNSELORS PEERS AND OTHER SOCIAL SUPPORT- WE'VE HEARD STORIES ABOUT TEXT MESSAGES INTENTIONALLY SAVING LIVES DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND FOR THE THOUSANDS WHO LACK BROADBAND ACCESS AND VIDEO CAPABILITIES THE PHONE AND TAX ARE THEIR MAIN ACCESS POINTS- ON. AN EQUITY ISSUE AND THE MOMENT TO BE USING EVERY POSSIBLE CHANNEL TO HELP OUR YOUNG PEOPLE NOT TO BE LIMITING OR UNDER FUNDING TOOLS WE NOW ARE HELPING.

WE HAVE SUICIDE HOTLINE AND ALSO TO SETUP LIVE CHAT. MOST PEOPLE WOULD GO LIKE ME TO TAX SOMEONE THEY KNOW OVER SOME RANDOM PERSON OVER A CHAT. I WOULD HAVE MADE IT TO MY CRISIS WITHOUT TEXTING MY THERAPIST. AND OTHER PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO STABLE NETWORK TO SUPPORT THE VIDEO CALLED.

THAT COMES FROM THE LINE EIGHTY. HELLO MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ADAM THIS IS SERRA FLOCKS I'M REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK AND HE PENNED A PLOT TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND AND MAKE PERMANENT THAT THE TELEHEALTH FLEXIBILITY FOR MEDICAL PROVIDERS THE PANDEMIC HAS ACCELERATED AND EXPANDED THE USE OF TELEHEALTH WITH THE RAPID DEPLOYMENT AND THIS MAKES IT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. CONSIDER EQUITY AND THE NEEDS OF BLACK INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME PATIENTS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND LIMITED ENGLISH SPEAKERS IT'S ALSO IMPERATIVE TO ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE IN RURAL AREAS THAT EXPERIENCE DIGITAL BARRIERS AT HIGHER OF LATE. AND SO OUR RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH TELEHEALTH INVESTMENT AND INCREASE THE INVESTMENT AND TARGET THE DOLLARS TO ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO ADOPTION OF BROADBAND AND FIBER OPTICS DIGITAL CELLULAR TECHNOLOGY REIMBURSEMENT FOR TEAM BASED CARE AND EXPANDED ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE PATIENT TOOLS AND SUPPORT.

GOOD EVENING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS CHRIS AND I'M BACK WITH THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIPS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING THE HEARING ON THE IMPORTANCE OF HELLO HELLO. MANY SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HELLO HEALTH OPTIONS HAVE BEEN A REAL LIFELINE TO REINFORCE THOSE A PART DURING THE TIME IN PARTICULAR AS SURVIVORS ARE SHELTERING AT HOME AND MAY BE IN A HOME OR WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND PERHAPS. THE PERSON WHO IS. NEW CALL FROM AND VIOLENCE WITH THE GUN FUN. THE BILL WOULD BE TO RE OUT FOR SUPPORT BE A- OR VIA CALL- AND PROVIDE THAT ACCESS WITHOUT THEM HAVING TO. LEAVE HOME AND CHILD CARE FOR THEIR KIDS THE MOTHER OF A PANDEMIC FIND A REASON OTHER ABUSIVE PARTNER WILL BECOME A SPECIAL FOCUS ON MOVING OUT. OF HAVE BEEN A REAL VITAL RESOURCE BUT HOW CAPS THEIR FIBERS CONNECTED TO THE CARE. THEY NEED. I REALLY WANNA APPRECIATE YOU ALL FOR RAISING THE IMPORTANT ISSUE AND CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT- THE PEOPLE IN NEED OF THE- PHONE AND VIDEO AND ALL PARTS. OF OPTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT CALLER PLEASE. I HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. PLEASE CONTINUE OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THAT WILL CLOSE OUR PUBLIC COMMENT BRING IT BACK- DO YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS- MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. OKAY I DO HAVE A COUPLE CLOSING COMMENTS AND- AFTER LISTENING TO PUBLIC COMMENT I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO CLARIFY A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL- I HAVE BEEN ALL ABOUT ACCESS TO CARE IN MY ENTIRE CAREER HERE AS A MATTER OF FACT ACCESS TO CARE IN MY ENTIRE CAREER IN MEDICAL PROCTOR DENTAL PRACTICE- I DO BELIEVE THERE. IS ABSOLUTELY OF VALUE FOR TELEPHONIC CARE. WHERE I HACKED HAVE HEARTBURN QUITE FRANKLY IS THE RATE OF WHICH WE WHAT MIGHT PAY FOR A TELEPHONIC CARE YOU HEARD FROM DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SRVICES THAT CURRENTLY UNDER FEDERAL LAW- A VISIT FOR AN FQHC WOULD HAVE TO BE REIMBURSED AT THE PPS RATE. SO AS I SAID EARLIER PPS RATES RANGE FROM SIXTY THREE DOLLARS AND SIXTY NINE CENTS. TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AND SIXTY SEVEN CENTS SERVICE. I CAN'T JUSTIFY A SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR PHONE CALL I'M SORRY I CAN'T I CAN'T DO THAT ME TELL YOU WHY. IT FEELS LIKE WE WILL BE OVER FINDING A LESS EXPENSIVE MODALITY FOR PROVIDING CARE. WHEN I PRACTICE DENTISTRY WHICH IS BEEN A WHILE NOW- A PATIENT WOULD COME INTO MY OFFICE THEY WOULDCOME INTO THEY WOULD REGRET REGRET MY RECEPTIONIST THEY WOULD BE SEATED BY MY ASSISTANT. THAT WOULD TAKE UP- THE ROOM THERE WAS PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT INVOLVED THERE WAS A FACILITY INVOLVED. AND THERE ARE HARD COST TO THAT. WITH A TELEPHONE VISIT. THERE IS NO COST- NONE OF THOSE COSTS ARE INCURRED THERE IS NO RECEPTIONIST THERE IS NO SUPPORT STAFF THERE IS NO MEDICAL STAFF THERE'S NO PP BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING. THERE EXCEPT THE TELEPHONE WHICH ALREADY EXISTS IN EVERY FQHC IN THE IN THE STATE. SO THE IDEA THAT PARITY AT PPS SIMPLY JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME AND- I YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS ADVANCING TELEHEALTH IN A WAY. OF IN IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY- POSTS AND THEY'RE PROPOSING THAT POST FROM THE PRE PANDEMIC- STATE THAT WE'RE IN. THIS TO ME BAGS OF A VISIT BACK TO AN ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS SO THAT WE ARE NOT BREAKING THE BANK POTENTIALLY- WITH THE MODALITY THAT IS LESS EXPENSIVE TO PROVIDE SO- JUST WANNA BE CLEAR I ABSOLUTELY SEE THE VALUE OF A PHONE VISIT- AND- I JUST AND STRUGGLING WITH THE COSTS- WE ARE STRUGGLING IN THIS STATE- AROUND THE COST TO PROVIDE CARE. WE HAVE NEARLY FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE ON MEDICARE. AND AND COST CONTROL COST CONTROLS AND COST CONTAINMENT HAVE TO BE A PART OF THE DISCUSSION SO. I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR- COMMENTS HERE TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO TALK ABOUT THIS AS WE GO FORWARD. AND I WISH YOU ALL A GOOD EVENING THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
