00:20:06.204 --> 00:20:07.940
SPEAK.

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:09.908

OVER FIVE BOOKS.

00:20:18.483 --> 00:20:20.586
AND THERE WERE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS

00:20:20.652 --> 00:20:22.487
ON HIS LIFE AND YES WE LOST SOME

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:35.233
THERE.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.635
AND LIKELY NO ONE WAS HURT.

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:38.837
AND NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT WHILE
