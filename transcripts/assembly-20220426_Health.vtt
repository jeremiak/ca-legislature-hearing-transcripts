AND THROUGH OUR WORK SHE'S MET

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:34.333
DOZENS OF WOMEN'S WHO DID

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.068

EVEN SAY THE WORD ABORTION MUCH

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.526

SUPPRESS IT DETAILS THE TRAUMA

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.467
COMES FROM THE FACT THAT WE ALL

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:10.269
KNOW IT'S ALWAYS WRONG TO KILL

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:12.571
AN INNOCENT HUMAN BEING WHICH IS

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:15.140
EXACTLY WHAT ABORTION DOES. BUT

NINETEEN AND AFTER THE FAMILY

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:37.463

THERAPEUTIC ABORTION ON A

PRESCRIPTION PAD. SHE RECALLS

00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:43.502
VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE ACTUAL

00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:44.470
ABORTION BECAUSE SHE

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:46.205
INTENTIONALLY SUPPRESSING MEMORY

00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:48.107

DISEASE IT WASN'T SEIZE IT WITH

THE PREGNANCY. AND CERTAINLY SHE

00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:57.216
WASN'T HEALED FROM THAT

00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:59.551
ABORTION. ABORTION HAS AN

00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:02.154
ENORMOUSLY NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON

00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:04.823

DETERMINED TO BE UTTERLY

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:14.533
DETACHED EVEN OFFERING TO PAY

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.568
HALF OF THE ABORTION BECAUSE IT

REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THE ABORTION

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.541
HERSELF. THAT REMEMBERS THE

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:25.344
CALLOUSNESS RESPONSE MUCH LATER

00:17:25.411 --> 00:17:26.612

EBBING AND FLOWING IN VARIOUS

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:35.185
MULTIPLE PARTS OF THE STATE THAT

00:42:35.252 --> 00:42:36.620
MIGHT NOT BE CLOSE TOGETHER. ALL

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:37.988
CONTRACT YOU GATHER FOR THE SAME

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:39.823
EXACT RATE. THAT DOESN'T

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.892
REFLECT. THOSE INDIVIDUAL

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:42.826
COMMUNITIES THAT DOESN'T REFLECT

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:44.194
THE COST OF NECESSARILY DOING

00:42:44.261 --> 00:42:46.230
BUSINESS THERE. WHAT IT DOES DO.

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:48.232
IS MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE PRICES

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:50.467
STAY HIGH AND I BELIEVE THAT'S

00:42:50.534 --> 00:42:51.635
ARTIFICIALLYHIGH. AND SO THIS

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:53.237
WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE

00:42:53.304 --> 00:42:55.572
REVIEW PROCESS. LUBIS SCRUTINY

00:42:55.639 --> 00:42:58.742
AROUND THIS. SAY THIS COULD BE

00:42:58.809 --> 00:43:00.411
FAIR FOR CONSUMERS ARE NOT. AND

00:43:00.477 --> 00:43:03.147
THE- I DON'T KNOW IF THE IF THE

00:43:03.213 --> 00:43:05.549
OPPOSITION WANTS TO ADDRESS THAT

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:06.784
ARE OFF YOU'VE GOT ANY THOUGHTS

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:13.490
ON ON THAT- THE ADVANTAGE OF-

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:15.392
HOSPITALS IN A LARGER SSTEM

00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:16.327
MEAN IF THEY'RE NOT

00:43:16.393 --> 00:43:18.095
GEOGRAPHICALLY NEXT TO EACH

00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:20.564
OTHER IS THAT THEY DO PROVIDE

00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:22.066
RESOURCES TO ALL THE HOSPITALS

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:24.001
IN THAT SYSTEM CLINICAL

00:43:24.068 --> 00:43:26.070
EXPERTISE I OFTENTIMES ITS

00:43:26.136 --> 00:43:28.372
FINANCIAL RESOURCES A HOSPITAL

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:30.975
THAT- WOULDN'T MAKE IT ON. ITS

00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:33.143
OWN CAN BE PART OF A LARGER

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.244
SYSTEM AND CONTRACTING AND

00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:38.515
NETWORKING TOGETHER- IN A STATE

00:43:38.582 --> 00:43:40.217
THAT HAS HIGHLY LEVERAGED-

00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:42.453
PAYMENT PLANS AS WELL IS JUST A

00:43:42.519 --> 00:43:44.421
WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY.

00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:48.826
IS ABLE TO- GET A FAIR RATE FOR

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:50.127
PROVIDING CARE IN THE IN THE

00:43:50.194 --> 00:43:53.030
COMMUNITY BUT IF I IF I MIGHT

00:43:53.097 --> 00:43:55.132
AND AGAIN YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:57.067
MY AREA BUT- THE COMMUNITIES OF

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:59.937
PALM SPRINGS- ARE VASTLY. IN THE

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:03.307
COMMUNITIES OF JOSHUA TREE- AND

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:05.409
TO THE RESPONDING- THEY ARE

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:06.977
DIFFERENT AND SO IF YOU'RE IF

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:08.946
YOU'RE NEGOTIATING A RICK- IT'S

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:11.115
THE SAME RATE SAYING IT'S GONNA

00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:13.884
ALL NOTHING. OUT AND I AND BY

00:44:13.951 --> 00:44:16.620
JOSH SHOULD BE A IS A MUCH PLACE

00:44:16.687 --> 00:44:17.187
EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST FORTY

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:21.859
MINUTES UP THE ROAD- WHY WOULD-

00:44:21.925 --> 00:44:26.063
BE A- FOR THE- COME UP THE BILL

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:32.569
. SAY THAT THOSE ARE. OVERSEE

00:44:32.636 --> 00:44:35.472
THE BILL- THE PROHIBITS WERE ALL

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:37.908
HA. COULD BE AND ALL OF TO BE IN

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:39.777
THE NAY AND DOESN'T THAT THE

00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:41.678
RATES HAVE TO BE THE SAME. SO

00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:43.013
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE PARTIES

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.015
COULD AGREE TO SAY YOU HAVE TO

00:44:45.082 --> 00:44:46.884
BE IN THE IN THE NETWORK YOU

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.186
HAVE TO CONTRACT WITH US. BUT

00:44:49.253 --> 00:44:50.187
THEN THERE IS A SEPARATE

00:44:50.254 --> 00:44:52.456
NEGOTIATION ON WHAT THE SPECIFIC

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:56.927
RATE IS THE BILL PROHIBITS- THE

00:44:56.994 --> 00:44:58.362
ABILITY TO KEEP ALL OF THE

00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:00.831
AFFILIATES TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:01.832
IT'S AN INTEGRATED COORDINATED

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:03.867
NETWORK. SO THE ECONOMICS I

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:04.968
GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT

00:45:05.035 --> 00:45:06.170
THE DID THE ECONOMICS BECOME

00:45:06.236 --> 00:45:08.305
PROBLEMATIC THEN FOR LIKE A

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:11.141
HOSPITAL LIKE JOSHUA TREE- WHERE

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:13.544
IS A SMALL RURAL AREA WOULD BE-

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.179
MAYBE IT WOULD WORK OUT MAYBE

00:45:15.245 --> 00:45:16.880
TEN IT WOULD DECIDE HEY IF IT'S

00:45:16.947 --> 00:45:18.415
NOT ALL OR NOTHING THEN WE WOULD

00:45:18.482 --> 00:45:20.584
HAVE DONE. THAN BUSINESS THERE

00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:23.220
THEY WOULD DECIDE TO BE ABLE TO-

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:24.054
TO DROP THAT CONTRACT RIGHT IN

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:26.256
AND WHAT WE SEE SOME GAMES WITH

00:45:26.323 --> 00:45:30.360
THESE HOSPITALS TO IS- THE PAIR

00:45:30.427 --> 00:45:32.029
THE HEALTH PLAN. THE INSURER

00:45:32.096 --> 00:45:33.964
CHOOSES A DIFFERENT HOSPITAL

00:45:34.031 --> 00:45:35.566
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY GOT A BETTER

00:45:35.632 --> 00:45:37.534
RATE. THAT MEANS ALL THE-

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:39.736
PATIENTS IN THAT COMMUNITY ARE

00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:40.737
DRIVING PAST THEIR LOCAL

00:45:40.804 --> 00:45:42.372
HOSPITAL. GOING TO ANOTHER

00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:44.675
HOSPITAL THAT'S FARTHER AWAY

00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:46.977
THAT'S ONE OF THE DISADVANTAGES

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:49.113
. AND THEN THE OTHER CONCERNED-

00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:52.316
THAT I- THAT I HAVE- AND I'M

00:45:52.382 --> 00:45:54.017
LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS I TRIED

00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:55.152
ACTUALLY FIND THIS IN THE

00:45:55.219 --> 00:45:57.087
LANGUAGE. OF THE BILL AND I'M

00:45:57.154 --> 00:45:58.388
SURE THAT IT'S THAT IT'S THERE

00:45:58.455 --> 00:46:01.758
BUT THIS IS ON PAGE THREE. AND

00:46:01.825 --> 00:46:05.195
ITS THE- THE BULLET OF THIRTEEN-

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:07.431
TALKING ABOUT THE ATTORNEYTHE

00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:09.099
DISCRETION IT'S GIVEN TO THE

00:46:09.166 --> 00:46:12.136
ATTORNEY GENERAL IT SEEMS TO BE.

00:46:12.202 --> 00:46:14.838
A LOT LIKE SOME- THAT YOU'RE

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:17.341
GIVING IT OFF A LOT OF POWER TO

00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:19.042
ONE INDIVIDUAL A TO BE ABLE TO

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:21.945
MAKE THESE AND YOU KNOW I'M I'M

00:46:22.012 --> 00:46:23.947
CONCERNED ABOUT GIVING. THAT

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:26.150
KIND OF POWER TO ONE OF ONE

00:46:26.216 --> 00:46:28.185
PERSON AND THE IN JUST THE

00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:29.620
LANGUAGE THAT'S THERE- WAS

00:46:29.686 --> 00:46:30.988
SAYING WHETHER OR NOT. WHETHER

00:46:31.054 --> 00:46:33.123
OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT WHETHER OR

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:37.027
NOT- THAT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S THE

00:46:37.094 --> 00:46:39.296
IT AG DOESN'T HAVE ANY- ROAD

00:46:39.363 --> 00:46:42.032
BLOCKS IF YOU WILL- TO BE ABLE

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:44.001
TO DECIDE- IS JUST YOUR

00:46:44.067 --> 00:46:46.370
COMPLETE. I'M AUTHORITY TO BE

00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:48.305
ABLE TO GO IN AND YOU DO THAT OF

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:50.240
COURSE OF CORRUPTION AND OTHER

00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:51.808
THINGS CAN END UP HAPPENING. IS

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:54.077
IS THERE ANY CONCERN ABOUT THAT-

00:46:54.144 --> 00:46:59.316
AT ALL TO TIGHTEN. UP BORDER TO

00:46:59.383 --> 00:47:00.551
MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE HAPPY TO

00:47:00.617 --> 00:47:01.885
CONTINUE WORKING WE WILL BE

00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:02.986
WORKING WITH JUDICIARY ON THIS

00:47:03.053 --> 00:47:05.289
AS WELL- I THINK YOU MIGHT BE

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:06.456
MESSY ATTORNEY GENERAL THEY

00:47:06.523 --> 00:47:07.824
MIGHT THINK THE LANGUAGE IS

00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:09.660
WEAKER THAN THEY WOULD LIKE

00:47:09.726 --> 00:47:12.663
QUITE FRANKLY- BUT- BUT- I DON'T

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:14.298
BELIEVE THAT. THAT THAT WILL BE

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:16.033
AN ISSUE I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK

00:47:16.099 --> 00:47:17.834
TO WHY WE'RE HERE. WE'RE HERE

00:47:17.901 --> 00:47:19.603
BECAUSE OF A SUTTER SETTLEMENTS.

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.372
OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:23.240
MILLION DOLLARS FOR ANTI

00:47:23.307 --> 00:47:25.542
COMPETITIVE PRACTICES. THAT'S

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:27.578
SIGNIFICANT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT

00:47:27.644 --> 00:47:29.346
AND WHAT THAT DID. WAS THAT YOU

00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:31.148
HEALTHCARE COSTS BEING 50%

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:33.183
HIGHER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. I

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.318
DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR

00:47:34.384 --> 00:47:35.786
CONSUMERS AND THE CARE

00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:37.054
NECESSARILY ISN'T BETTER THAN IT

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.022
IS IN YOUR AREA BUT IT IS WAY

00:47:39.089 --> 00:47:41.091
MORE EXPENSIVE. AND THAT'S WHAT

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:42.059
WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE AND

00:47:42.125 --> 00:47:44.494
I'D LIKE TO HAVE MIGHT WITNESS

00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:45.028

00:47:45.095 --> 00:47:46.997
QUESTIONS FOR YEAH OF BETH BELL

KNOW PALM SPRINGS AND- PART OF

00:47:51.635 --> 00:47:54.805
YOUR DISTRICTS ARE. OF UP I

00:47:54.871 --> 00:47:56.173
WOULD NOTE THAT THE ATTORNEY

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.874
GENERAL'S DISCRETION IS ALWAYS

00:47:57.941 --> 00:48:00.143
BOUNDED BY THE COURTS AND IN

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:02.980
FACT. IN A RECENT TRANSACTION

00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:04.615
INVOLVING HUNTINGTON AND CEDAR

00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:06.650
SIDE I THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:08.919
ASSOCIATION LITIGATED THEY THERE

00:48:08.986 --> 00:48:10.387
WERE THERE WAS A SETTLEMENT IT

00:48:10.454 --> 00:48:12.756
IT CAME TO A HAPPY PLACE BUT WE

00:48:12.823 --> 00:48:15.626
HAVE THIRTY YEARS. OF ATTORNEYS

00:48:15.692 --> 00:48:17.060
GENERAL GOING BACK TO DAN

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:19.663
LUNDGREN A REPUBLICAN IS WE MAY

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:23.300
RECALL- USING THIS AUTHORITY IN

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:25.202
A WHAT I WOULD SAY WAS A

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:27.471
RESPONSIBLE WAY ALWAYS SUBJECT

00:48:27.537 --> 00:48:29.840
TO REVIEW B THE COURTS AND SO

00:48:29.906 --> 00:48:32.309
THERE'S ALWAYS THE OPPORTUNITY

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:35.512
FOR- A CORE DUMP IN AND SAY THE

00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:37.214
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS OVERSTEPPED

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:39.283
THEIR BOUNDS AND- IN MY DEALINGS

00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:40.350
WITH ATTORNEYS GENERAL. OVER

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:41.485
THESE DECADES THEY'RE VERY

00:48:41.551 --> 00:48:44.288
MINDFUL THAT THEY HAVE TO BE

00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:47.758
WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE LAW

00:48:47.824 --> 00:48:51.228
. AND THEN- FINALLY THE- THE

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:53.764
FIVE MILLION DOLLAR A NUMBER WHY

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:55.732
WAS THAT WHY WAS FIVE MILLION-

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:57.534
THRESHOLD THAT WAS CHOSEN WHY

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:59.303
NOT TWENTY MILLION OR THIRTY

00:48:59.369 --> 00:49:01.004
MILLION OR TWO MILLION FOR THAT

00:49:01.071 --> 00:49:02.773
MATTER WHY FIVE FLIES FIVE

00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:05.075
MILLION THE- I THINK SOME PEOPLE

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:06.076
ARGUED FOR LESS SO QUITE

00:49:06.143 --> 00:49:10.280
FRANKLY- I DO. THAT IS YOU KNOW

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:11.381
IF THERE ARE KEY IS COMPELLING

00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:13.050
EVIDENCE THAT THAT IS THE

00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:15.052
INAPPROPRIATE NUMBER I'M OPEN TO

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:17.154
THAT- IF YOU'RE A IS CERTAINLY

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.922
RID SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:20.290
YOU KNOW PEOPLE MIGHT BE THERE

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:21.758
MIGHT BE INDIVIDUAL

00:49:21.825 --> 00:49:22.492
PRACTITIONERS LOOKING AT. VERGE

YOU KNOW. DOCTORS MERGING

00:49:24.661 --> 00:49:26.163
PRACTICES THOSE ARE LIKE NOT

00:49:26.229 --> 00:49:28.065
LIKELY TO BE HIT THAT THRESHOLD.

00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:29.666
WE'RE TRYING TO BE SENSITIVE TO

00:49:29.733 --> 00:49:32.469
PROVIDERS. BUT THESE ARE IN OF

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:33.603
THESE THESE LARGE MERGERS ARE

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.505
GONNA. THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

00:49:35.572 --> 00:49:37.240
HIGHER THAN THAN FIVE MILLION

00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:38.842

PEOPLE CAN MAKE A CASE FOR THAT

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:43.947
WE ARE OPEN TO THAT I. I THINK

THE OPPOSITION. BUT I DON'T LIKE

IS WHEN PEOPLE TO SAY NO WE

00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:51.888
DON'T OFFER OFFER A REASON WHY

01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:47.183
GOOD THING AND HAVING PEOPLE AT

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.251
THE TABLE AND TRYING TO COME UP

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:50.419
WITH A PLAN. SEEMS TO ME TO BE.

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:53.022
I'M IN A THE PROBLEM IS IF WE

01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:55.825
HAVE FOLKS FOR ON THESE HOLDS

01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:57.026
AND THEN THEY'RE JUST RELEASED

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:59.262
BACK OUT THEN IT BECOMES LAW

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:00.563

THAT DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:16.279

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:25.888

I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION- AND

01:45:11.104 --> 01:45:13.573
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO. HAVE A-

01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.475
THE XIN ABOUT THIS OUT HAVING

01:45:15.542 --> 01:45:17.444
EITHER SIDE BE UPSET WITH YOU.

01:45:17.511 --> 01:45:19.246

DERIVE THE DATA AND INFORMATION-

01:45:22.783 --> 01:45:25.152
BUT- WHAT I'M JUST. WHEN I WAS

01:45:25.218 --> 01:45:26.920
GOING THROUGH THE ANALYSIS AND

01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:28.655
SPEAKING ALSO TO MY STAFF WHEN I

01:45:28.722 --> 01:45:30.323
WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WAS.

01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:31.825
HOW MANY SCHOOLS WERE NOT

01:45:31.892 --> 01:45:33.393
PROVIDING THE VACCINE

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:36.496
INFORMATION NECESSARY THAT

01:45:36.563 --> 01:45:38.732
REQUIRES US. TO HAVE SOMETHING

01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:40.400
LIKE THIS IN PLACE THAT THE

01:45:40.467 --> 01:45:42.536
REQUIRES INFORMATION INFORMATION

01:45:42.602 --> 01:45:45.205
TO BE GATHERED. UP TO WHAT BUT I

01:45:45.272 --> 01:45:46.940
GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE

01:45:47.007 --> 01:45:48.241
OUT IS WHAT'S BEEN THE ISSUES

01:45:48.308 --> 01:45:51.244
WITH COMPLIANCE THAT'S REQUIRING

01:45:51.311 --> 01:45:59.052
US TO DO THIS BILL. RIGHT SO

01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:00.487
THIS BILL MANY MANY PROVIDERS

01:46:00.554 --> 01:46:02.255
ALREADY USE THE REGISTRY THE

01:46:02.322 --> 01:46:03.623
MAJORITY PROVIDERS USE REGISTRY

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:05.025
WE HAVE SO MANY MORE NEW

01:46:05.092 --> 01:46:05.959
PROVIDERS THAT ARE. ALSO USED IN

01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:07.894
REGISTERING OUTLAW WHAT MORE

01:46:07.961 --> 01:46:08.962
AWARENESS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE

01:46:09.029 --> 01:46:10.297
OF ADULT IMMUNIZATION FOR

01:46:10.363 --> 01:46:12.099
EXAMPLE IT'S A LIFESPAN REGISTRY

01:46:12.165 --> 01:46:14.868
SO IN A BUT PRIMARILY AT FIRST

01:46:14.935 --> 01:46:17.204
WE WERE FOCUSING ON CHILDREN BUT

01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:18.705
- EVERYBODY. LIKE I SAID

01:46:18.772 --> 01:46:20.373
MILLION. INTO DOSES OF GONE IN

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.209
SINCE COVERT VACCINES BECOME

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:28.281
AVAILABLE. AND THE GOAL IS TO

01:46:28.348 --> 01:46:30.517
MAKE SURE THAT ALL PROVIDERS ARE

01:46:30.584 --> 01:46:32.619
USING IT I'D HAVE TO ONE ALSO

01:46:32.686 --> 01:46:33.587
SURE THAT MAJORITY OF DATE. WAS

01:46:33.653 --> 01:46:35.021
SHARED BY TWO MILITANTS WERE

01:46:35.088 --> 01:46:36.056
LINKED WITH. ELECTRONIC HEALTH

01:46:36.123 --> 01:46:37.824
WE HAVE A GREAT STAFF AT CDPH

01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:39.693
TONS OF FOLKS WORKING ON MAKING

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:43.096
PERMITS IT SEEMS THIS. THE CARE

01:46:43.163 --> 01:46:45.999
PROVIDERS GET THAT DATA THE ROOT

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:47.067
STREET SO WE WANT TO GO THE

01:46:47.134 --> 01:46:49.770
EXTRA MILE NOW TO GET THOSE.

01:46:49.836 --> 01:46:50.370
OTHER PROVIDERS THAT HAVEN'T

01:46:50.437 --> 01:46:51.037
BEEN USING THE REGISTRY FOR

01:46:51.104 --> 01:46:52.773
WHATEVER REASON AND MAKE SURE

01:46:52.839 --> 01:46:53.974
THAT THEY ARE. DOES THAT HELP

01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:54.975
ANSWER THAT'S ONE OF THEM SHOT

01:46:55.041 --> 01:46:57.477
THE OTHER PART IS MAKING SURE

01:46:57.544 --> 01:46:58.545
THAT SCHOOLS. ARE FINANCED OUT

01:46:58.612 --> 01:47:00.747
THAT- THE SCHOOLS HAVE ACCESS TO

01:47:00.814 --> 01:47:03.784
BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT VACCINES

01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:05.185
CHILDREN HAVE. IT THEY CAN SEE

01:47:05.252 --> 01:47:08.288
THE REQUIRED SCHOOL DOCUMENTS

01:47:08.355 --> 01:47:10.056
VACCINATIONS RIGHT NOW BUT IN IN

01:47:10.123 --> 01:47:13.894
SOME. THE PUBLIC HEALTH. ME NEED

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:17.998
TO BE. SOME GOOD. YEAH I THINK I

01:47:18.064 --> 01:47:19.533
AM CHILDREN MOVE IN CHILDREN A

01:47:19.599 --> 01:47:21.468
LOT AND BEFORE I CAN WOULD HAVE

01:47:21.535 --> 01:47:22.969
THEIR OWN I MEAN IS REGISTRY OR

01:47:23.036 --> 01:47:25.405
A SCHOOL WOULD COLLECTED THEY

01:47:25.472 --> 01:47:27.040
WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN REGISTRY

01:47:27.107 --> 01:47:28.308
THEIR OWN DATABASE WITHIN THEIR

01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:30.510
SCHOOL DISTRICT N. AND THEN THEY

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:33.346
WOULD MOVE AND ALL F THAT

01:47:33.413 --> 01:47:33.980
INFORMATION WOULD BE LOST

01:47:34.047 --> 01:47:36.183
MILITARY IF GOOD DAY OF THAT YOU

01:47:36.249 --> 01:47:39.019
KNOW WHICH THAT WHERE DID PUT

01:47:39.085 --> 01:47:40.086
THAT RECORD. BEFORE I MOVED HERE

01:47:40.153 --> 01:47:42.189
FROM STATE WHERE IS IT I GET

01:47:42.255 --> 01:47:44.591
PERMISSION AND SO I THINK THAT.

01:47:44.658 --> 01:47:46.026
HAVING IT ALL IN ONE PLACE THE

01:47:46.092 --> 01:47:47.494
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE

01:47:47.561 --> 01:47:49.129
EVERYBODY FROM CALIFORNIA CAN GO

01:47:49.196 --> 01:47:51.131
LOOK AT THAT ONE SPOT JUST MAKE

01:47:51.198 --> 01:47:53.066
SO MUCH MORE SENSE IT JUST GETS

01:47:53.133 --> 01:47:56.336
RID OF ALL THAT FOR. BUT YOU

01:47:56.403 --> 01:48:00.373
HAVE DATA TO WHAT- IF THERE'S

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.309
BEEN A CHALLENGE OR HAVE YOU

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:04.544
BEEN ABLE TO QUANTIFY WHAT'S NOT

01:48:04.611 --> 01:48:08.281
BEING REPORTED THAT IS POSING A

01:48:08.348 --> 01:48:14.888
PROBLEM TO NECESSITATE THIS. WE

01:48:14.955 --> 01:48:16.756
NEED TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE

01:48:16.823 --> 01:48:18.558
AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL PROVIDERS

01:48:18.625 --> 01:48:19.659
ARE ACCESSING THE SYSTEM TO PUT

01:48:19.726 --> 01:48:22.362
IN THE IMMUNIZATION DATA TO KNOW

01:48:22.429 --> 01:48:25.465
WHERE OUR POPULATIONS THAT- WE

01:48:25.532 --> 01:48:27.300
KNOW IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT BUT WE

01:48:27.367 --> 01:48:28.735
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S

01:48:28.802 --> 01:48:29.402
HAPPENING BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT

01:48:29.469 --> 01:48:31.371
TO THE WHOLE POPULATION. AND I

01:48:31.438 --> 01:48:33.440
KNOW WHO YEAH GO AHEAD. SO I

01:48:33.506 --> 01:48:36.576
THINK- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU KNOW

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:37.744
BETTER YOU DO BETTER RIGHT AND

01:48:37.811 --> 01:48:42.315
SO. WE YOU KNOW. TEN FIFTEEN

01:48:42.382 --> 01:48:44.384
YEARS AGO EVEN MORE WHEN I

01:48:44.451 --> 01:48:47.888
STARTED- AS A PHYSICIAN WE WERE

01:48:47.954 --> 01:48:52.659
RIDING ON CHART. RIGHT AND- THE

01:48:52.726 --> 01:48:54.127
ISSUE WAS DO WE UNDERSTAND

01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:55.428
EVERYBODY'S HAND WRITING OR WITH

01:48:55.495 --> 01:48:57.063
A LOSS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:48:57.130 --> 01:48:58.131
AND THEN WE SLOWLY STARTED

01:48:58.198 --> 01:49:00.133
SWITCHING OVER TO ELECTRONIC

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:02.302
MEDICAL RECORDS REMEMBER WE DID

01:49:02.369 --> 01:49:05.171
CERNER AND CHICAGO WHEN I WAS AT

01:49:05.238 --> 01:49:06.339
COOK COUNTY AND THEN. WE'VE ALL

01:49:06.406 --> 01:49:08.008
SWITCHED OVER TO A DIFFERENT

01:49:08.074 --> 01:49:09.109
METHOD NOW BECAUSE WE KNOW

01:49:09.175 --> 01:49:10.977
BETTER WE DO BETTER AND MOST

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:13.380
PHYSICIANS. ARE USING SOME KIND

01:49:13.446 --> 01:49:14.915
OF ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD I

01:49:14.981 --> 01:49:17.050
THINK IT WOULD BE VERY RARE FOR

01:49:17.117 --> 01:49:18.652
YOU TO GO INTO A DOCTOR'S OFFICE

01:49:18.718 --> 01:49:19.653
AND HAVE SOMEBODY ACTUALLY.

01:49:19.719 --> 01:49:21.054
WRITING DOWN AND YOU SEE YOUR

01:49:21.121 --> 01:49:22.856
CHART RIGHT THERE ANYMORE I

01:49:22.923 --> 01:49:25.325
THINK THE SAME THING ABOUT

01:49:25.392 --> 01:49:26.793
IMMUNIZATION- YOU KNOW WE KNOW

01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:28.461
THAT IT IS- BETTER FOR THE-

01:49:28.528 --> 01:49:30.196
PATIENTS BETTER FOR THE PARENTS

01:49:30.263 --> 01:49:32.065
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT LIKE WHERE

01:49:32.132 --> 01:49:34.000
IS THAT YELLOW CARD I CAN'T

01:49:34.067 --> 01:49:35.302
BELIEVE I WAS ASKED FOR A YELLOW

01:49:35.368 --> 01:49:37.671
CARD WHEN I HAVE TO HAVE YOUR

01:49:37.737 --> 01:49:40.740
CARD. I WAS CAN'T. BE ABLE TO

NEED TO VERIFY IT FOR YOUR

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:45.378
SCHOOL THAT YOUR CHILD HAS BEEN

01:49:45.445 --> 01:49:46.980
IMMUNIZED YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO

01:49:47.047 --> 01:49:49.316
AND- HOBBIES OR FIND SOMETHING-

01:49:49.382 --> 01:49:52.519
YOU KNOW A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT

01:49:52.585 --> 01:49:55.021
TO SOUTH AFRICA ONCE I GOT THE-

01:49:55.088 --> 01:49:55.855
YELLOW FEVER BACK. TO THE

01:49:55.922 --> 01:49:57.490
LIFETIME THING I LOST MY YELLOW

01:49:57.557 --> 01:50:00.627
CARD NEXT TIME I WAS GOING I HAD

01:50:00.694 --> 01:50:04.864
TO GET IT AGAIN. SO. YOU BETTER

01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:06.866
AND THIS IS A- OF DOING BETTER

01:50:06.933 --> 01:50:07.467
BE WE KNOW THE- IMMUNIZATION

01:50:07.534 --> 01:50:09.135
REGISTRIES HAVE WORKED AT THE

01:50:09.202 --> 01:50:11.571
CONFIDENTIAL- AND- SO IF

01:50:11.638 --> 01:50:12.739
SOMEONE. DOESN'T WANT THEIR

01:50:12.806 --> 01:50:13.807
INFORMATION SHARED THEY DON'T

01:50:13.873 --> 01:50:16.309
HAVE TO HAVE A CHAIRED. BUT THIS

01:50:16.376 --> 01:50:18.078
IS JUST EXPANDING IT SO THAT

01:50:18.144 --> 01:50:19.512
WHEN THAT NEXT PUBLIC HEALTH

01:50:19.579 --> 01:50:21.514
CRISIS COMMS. WE HAVE AS MUCH

01:50:21.581 --> 01:50:23.283
INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE. WE'RE

01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:25.118
DOING AS MUCH AS WE CAN FOR OUR

01:50:25.185 --> 01:50:26.519
RESIDENTS TO MAKE THEIR LIVES

01:50:26.586 --> 01:50:29.422
EASIER. AND SO THIS IS WHY IT

01:50:29.489 --> 01:50:32.192
NEEDED TO BE EXPANDED. BUT

01:50:32.258 --> 01:50:34.127
THERE'S NO SPECIFIC. DATA OR

01:50:34.194 --> 01:50:38.331
ISSUE I WOULD. SO AT THIS WE

01:50:38.398 --> 01:50:40.433
HAVE A LONG MEETING I DON'T

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:44.070
WANNA GO ON BUT I DO WANT TO

01:50:44.137 --> 01:50:47.040
JUST. AT MY OWN BY CONCERN IS WE

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:49.909
ALSO HAVE AN IMPERFECT SYSTEM.

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:52.278
ANNA OUR IMPERFECT SYSTEM IS

01:50:52.345 --> 01:50:54.481
FRAUGHT WITH VULNERABILITIES AND

01:50:54.547 --> 01:50:56.316
WE'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN

01:50:56.383 --> 01:50:58.284
WITH INFORMATION BEING LEAKED

01:50:58.351 --> 01:51:00.920
OUT UNFORTUNATELY WHEN IT WAS

01:51:00.987 --> 01:51:06.860
UNINTENDED- SO I AM. I'M I'M

01:51:06.926 --> 01:51:08.528
QUITE HONESTLY OF TWO MINDS AYE

01:51:08.595 --> 01:51:11.431
AYE AYE THERE'S NO QUESTION

01:51:11.498 --> 01:51:13.466
ABOUT ME SUPPORTING UNIONIZATION

01:51:13.533 --> 01:51:15.835
BUT SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE WE

01:51:15.902 --> 01:51:18.705
WORK AROUND THE EDGES TOO MUCH

01:51:18.772 --> 01:51:21.708
ON ISSUE AREAS THAT WE MAY

01:51:21.775 --> 01:51:23.877
RATHER WAIT TO SEE CHALLENGE

01:51:23.943 --> 01:51:25.445
FIRST BROUGHT. RATHER THAN

01:51:25.512 --> 01:51:27.680
SOMETHING TO CREATE A PERFECT

01:51:27.747 --> 01:51:30.417
SYSTEM WHEN- AGAIN WHEN WE'RE

01:51:30.483 --> 01:51:32.052
DEALING WITH A LOT OF

01:51:32.118 --> 01:51:34.821
IMPERFECTIONS AND- THE WAY WE

01:51:34.888 --> 01:51:37.690
HANDLE A LOT OF THINGS. AS WAS

01:51:37.757 --> 01:51:38.258
EVIDENCED DURING THIS LAST

01:51:38.324 --> 01:51:43.063
PANDEMIC- SO. WELL I THINK ONE

01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:44.364
OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE

01:51:44.431 --> 01:51:46.299
SYSTEM LIKE I SAID IT'S BEEN IN

01:51:46.366 --> 01:51:47.700
EXISTENCE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS

01:51:47.767 --> 01:51:49.436
AND SO HOW MANY- DATA BREACHES

01:51:49.502 --> 01:51:50.904
HAVE. THE REGISTRY HAVE OVER THE

01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:55.241
LAST TWENTY YEARS. ZERO OKAY.

01:51:55.308 --> 01:51:56.976
IT'S AN EXCELLENT SYSTEM M. THE

01:51:57.043 --> 01:51:58.378
LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE IS

01:51:58.445 --> 01:52:00.313
INVESTED WELL IN THIS IN THIS

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:01.548
PROJECT FOR SURE I'M HAPPY TO

01:52:01.614 --> 01:52:03.249
TAKE ANY QUESTIONS BACK AND GET

01:52:03.316 --> 01:52:05.552
THEM ANSWERED BY- YOUR TECHNICAL

01:52:05.618 --> 01:52:08.388
STAFF AT THE CDPH BECAUSE- THEY

01:52:08.455 --> 01:52:11.124
HAVE. A WONDERFULLY TALENTED

01:52:11.191 --> 01:52:12.125
TEAM THERE AND THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:52:12.192 --> 01:52:13.426
WORKING HARD FOR PUBLIC HEALTH

01:52:13.493 --> 01:52:15.929
AND YOU SHOULD ALL BE VERY PROUD

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:17.897
OF THEM. LET THE OPPOSITION A

01:52:17.964 --> 01:52:19.999
QUESTION IF THAT'S OKAY MISTER

01:52:20.066 --> 01:52:22.068
NAZARIAN. THANK YOU I JUST

01:52:22.135 --> 01:52:24.003
WANTED TO ON TO GIVE MORE LIGHT

01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:26.339
TO YOUR ON SITE AND THE MAJORITY

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:27.006
OF LARGE ORGANIZATIONS OR ALL OR

01:52:27.073 --> 01:52:28.908
LARGE ORGANIZATIONS ARE KAISER

01:52:28.975 --> 01:52:32.378
UCSF ALL OF THEM WILL GREENS IS

01:52:32.445 --> 01:52:33.746
THE CARAMELIZATION TREE

01:52:33.813 --> 01:52:34.914
CURRENTLY WHO DOESN'T USE IT A

01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:36.783
MOSTLY INDEPENDENT OUR DOCTORS

01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:38.118
BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE TRAINING IT

01:52:38.184 --> 01:52:41.221
DOES TAKE EXTRA SOFTWARE- AND

01:52:41.287 --> 01:52:43.356
TIME AND AN EFFORT- BUT THOSE

01:52:43.423 --> 01:52:45.625
DOCTORS STILL KEEP ELECTRONIC

01:52:45.692 --> 01:52:47.460
RECORDS. I THINK FOR US YOU KNOW

01:52:47.527 --> 01:52:49.028
ONE OF THE KEY PIECES HERE IS

01:52:49.095 --> 01:52:51.364
THE LOCKING OF THE DATA YOU CAN

01:52:51.431 --> 01:52:52.765
LOCK IT BUT THE DATA STILL

01:52:52.832 --> 01:52:54.701
REMAINS THERE AND SO OUR CONCERN

01:52:54.767 --> 01:52:57.637
REALLY IS- THE FACT THAT ONCE

01:52:57.704 --> 01:53:01.708
EVERY DOCTOR IS REQUIRED OR

01:53:01.774 --> 01:53:03.576

01:53:03.643 --> 01:53:06.012

THE WERE NOT IN SYSTEM THE WOULD

01:53:17.757 --> 01:53:19.559
CHOOSE TO OPT IN OR NOT HAVE

01:53:19.626 --> 01:53:21.094
THEIR INFORMATION PUT IN THERE

01:53:21.161 --> 01:53:23.596

01:53:23.663 --> 01:53:24.597

03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:20.754
PERSISTENCE OF P. FIVE

03:28:20.821 --> 03:28:22.790
CHEMICALS. CALIFORNIA HAS

03:28:22.857 --> 03:28:24.358
ALREADY PROHIBITED THE ENTIRE

BECAUSE A RECENT STUDY CONDUCTED

03:29:00.561 --> 03:29:02.129
CREATING A BUYER BEWARE

03:29:02.196 --> 03:29:07.534
SITUATION. TO ASSEMBLY. IS A

03:29:07.601 --> 03:29:09.403
PUBLIC PROBLEM. THESE LOCALS

03:29:09.470 --> 03:29:11.071
HAVE ALSO. THE DRINKING OF OVER

03:29:11.138 --> 03:29:13.474
SEVENTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS.

03:58:09.541 --> 03:58:10.776
DISRUPTIVE THAT IT PROBABLY

03:58:10.843 --> 03:58:12.578
