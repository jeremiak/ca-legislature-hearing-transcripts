DEMONSTRATE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:06.477
FINANCIAL NEED AND- FINANCIAL

00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:08.079
NEED IS BASED IN PART ON THE

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:10.047
COST OF ATTENDANCE. IN GENERAL

00:34:10.114 --> 00:34:11.149

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:12.656
QUESTIONS ON MR GALLAGHER. I

00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:18.862
THINK THE QUESTION YEAH- IF YOU

NEED. THAT THE FINANCIAL NEWS

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:25.202
PER SE. EVEN THOUGH THE

00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:30.841
SITUATION MIGHT HAVE OKAY-

00:43:30.908 --> 00:43:31.976
WHAT'S REALLY THE BASIS FOR

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:33.877
THAT BECAUSE I MEAN AS ALWAYS I

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:35.112
THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:37.581
ACCOUNT THAT WE DO HAVE. WE

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:41.018
HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES- AND

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:42.219
WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS ALL THE

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:43.554
LEGITIMATE NEEDS THAT EVERYBODY

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.856
HAS- AND THERE'S AND THERE

00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:48.258
CERTAINLY ARE A LOT OF THEM.

00:43:48.325 --> 00:43:50.327
BUT SORT OF ASSUMING THAT

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:52.029
WITHOUT REALLY. AND IN THIS

00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:55.666
BUDGET. I GUESS I WOULD JUST

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:57.601
ASK WHAT KIND OF THE BASIS FOR

00:43:57.668 --> 00:43:58.168
THAT AND HOW DO WE DETERMINE

00:43:58.235 --> 00:44:00.571
THAT. THAT FINANCIAL NEED IS

00:44:00.637 --> 00:44:01.538
STILL THE SAME EVEN THOUGH

00:44:01.605 --> 00:44:03.474
SOMEONE'S. MAY NOT HAVE TO PAY

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:07.644
FOR HOUSING FOR INSTANCE- SO

00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:08.212
MAYBE IF SOMEBODY COULD JUST

00:44:08.278 --> 00:44:12.883

00:44:22.126 --> 00:44:23.927
BECAUSE OF THIS CHANGE-

00:44:23.994 --> 00:44:25.262
WHATEVER OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:26.597

INVESTMENT- WE WOULD NOTE THAT

00:58:58.401 --> 00:58:59.903
THIS WOULD STILL LEAVE. MANY

00:58:59.969 --> 00:59:01.437
THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS WITHOUT

FORWARD UNDER CAL GRANT

00:59:23.192 --> 00:59:24.827
MODERNIZATION WE CAN ELIMINATE

00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:26.362
THE ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS THAT

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:28.298

00:59:28.364 --> 00:59:29.799
IN THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM IN

00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:31.267
THE FIRST PLACE AND PROVIDER

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:32.602
MOST FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE

00:59:32.669 --> 00:59:34.337
STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WITH

00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:39.108
MORE PREDICTABLE ACCESS. TO

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:39.742
STATE FINANCIAL AID. THANK YOU.

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:43.680
THANK YOU. OKAY I WANT TO START

00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:47.684
TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE- FIRST

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.018
OF ALL THIS IS IT'S A IT'S A

00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:50.320
PLUS THAT WE'RE DRAMATICALLY

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:51.654
INCREASING THE CAL GRANT

00:59:51.721 --> 00:59:53.856
COMPETITIVE AWARDS BY NINE

00:59:53.923 --> 00:59:54.724
THOUSAND AND AS YOU SAID LAST

00:59:54.791 --> 00:59:57.360
YEAR- LAST YEAR WAS THE BIGGEST

00:59:57.427 --> 00:59:59.362
INCREASE SO. YOU KNOW FIVE TEN

00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:00.697
YEARS AGO YOUR ODDS OF GETTING

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:01.764
AT COMPETITIVE WARD I THINK

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:03.533
LIKE ONE AND FIFTEEN NOW WITH

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:05.234
THIS THERE WOULD BE ONE AND

01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:05.902
FIVE SO THAT'S A DRAMATIC

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:07.770
IMPROVEMENT. BUT I THINK THE

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:09.339
BIG PICTURE IS THAT WE HAVE

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:13.242
THESE- CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WHICH

01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:15.678
YOU KNOW REWARDS INDIVIDUALS TO

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:17.313
FILL OUT THE FACT THAT WHEN

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.114
THEY'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT THEN

01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:19.482
IF YOU LET'S SAY DURING THIS

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:21.017
PANDEMIC IT SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:22.485
GO TO SCHOOL FOR A YEAR YOU'RE

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:24.420
GOING TO WORK HELP YOUR FAMILY.

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:25.455
YOU'RE STILL A GREAT STUDENT

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:26.756
AND THEN YOU APPLY FOR THE

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:28.391
CARAVAN A COUPLE YEARS LATER

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:29.892
AND YOUR YOUR YOUR ELIGIBILITY

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.728
IF YOUR INCOME IS HASN'T

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:33.329
CHANGED THEIR GRADES WERE THE

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:34.998
SAME AS IN HIGH SCHOOL THEN

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:35.765
YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE IN THIS

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:37.166
COMPETITIVE POT AND SO IT'S NO

01:00:37.233 --> 01:00:38.601
LONGER AN ENTITLEMENT YOU KNOW

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:39.302
YOU HAVE TO GO IN THIS

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.770
COMPETITIVE POTTON COME AND

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:42.638
COMPETE WITH. YOU KNOW TENS OF

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:43.539
THOUSANDS IN YOUR ODDS OF

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:44.807
GETTING OUT ARE ONE IN FIVE AND

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:46.843
SO- THERE'S NOTHING CHANGE WITH

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:47.910
THAT STUDENT THERE'S STILL A

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.278
QUALIFIED STUDENTS ARE STILL

01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:51.247
READY TO LEARN BUT WE JUST

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:52.515
TREAT THEM DIFFERENTLY AND SO

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:54.684
THIS IS ONE OF- I THINK THE

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:56.119
MISTAKES WHEN WITH THE CAL

01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:57.887
GRANT- PROGRAM WHEN WE CREATED

01:00:57.954 --> 01:00:59.856
IT ABOUT TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO.

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:02.058
SO WHAT WE WOULD WE WOULD HELP

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:03.926
AND I KNOW THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.695
SEVEN TO LOOK AT MODERNIZING

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:07.797
AND ELIMINATING BARRIERS AND

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:11.534
SIMPLIFYING- ELIGIBILITY- AS

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:14.337
AS- AS MR O'DONNELL SAID AND WE

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:15.938
THINK IT'S EASY YOU JUST HAVE

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:16.973
TO DO ONE THING FILL OUT THE

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.307
FORM AND THE STATE WILL TELL

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:19.442
YOU WHICH ONE YOU'RE ELIGIBLE

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:20.543
FOR GRANT THERE'S TWO FORMS IF

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.178
YOU'RE- A DOCUMENT IN

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:22.945
CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:25.014
APPLICATION BUT- YOU KNOW I

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.983
THINK THAT IT'S THE CHANCE TO.

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:29.285
TO MAKE THIS EASIER AND TAKE

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:30.987
CARE MORE STUDENTS NOT THE

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:32.955
OPPOSITE BUT ALL THIS COSTS

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:35.024
MONEY AND THE GOOD NEWS OF THIS

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:36.626
DOES PUT IN THIRTY FIVE MILLION

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:39.128
DOLLARS MORE. INTO FINANCIALLY

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:40.430
IN CALIFORNIA PLUS WE'VE GOT A

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:42.498
PROPOSAL SO THAT IS IN THE

01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:43.766
RIGHT DIRECTION CERTAINLY WE

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:48.137
COULD ALWAYS ATTEMPTED. TO TAKE

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:50.373
TO GO MORE- YOU KNOW- WILL GET

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.341
THAT BITES. IS CERTAINLY. GET

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:53.709
STRONG SUPPORTER THIS IS ALWAYS

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:55.511
BEEN A PRIORITY OF A BILL OF

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:56.779
THE ASSEMBLY TO INCREASE THE

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:59.215
COMPETITIVE AWARDS- BUT AGAIN I

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:01.150
THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS IN

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:03.653
A LARGER CONTEXT MR MEDINA. ALL

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:06.055
RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT I TOTALLY

01:02:06.122 --> 01:02:09.358
AGREE WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR- IT

01:02:09.425 --> 01:02:11.394
IS SO COMPLICATED AS MR

01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:13.262
O'DONNELL SAID AND THAT SEEMS

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:14.664
LIKE THE CHANCES OF GETTING ONE

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:17.800
OF THESE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:19.168
ARE SMALLER THAN THAN WINNING

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:20.803
THE LOTTERY AND SHOULDN'T BE

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:22.438
THAT WAY SO I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:25.842
WORKING. WITH YOU TO SIMPLIFY-

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:30.046
THE WHOLE SYSTEM. OKAY MISTER

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:32.148
O'DONNELL IN MR GALLAGHER. YEAH

01:02:32.215 --> 01:02:35.585
I JUST WANT TO. HELLO WHAT DID

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:36.853
THE TWO OF YOU STATE IS IF

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:37.687
THERE'S A WAY THERE'S SOME

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:39.889
PROCESS TO MAKE THIS EASIER IT

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:40.823
WOULD BE MUCH BETTER AND WHY

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.658
NOT WHEN STUDENTS FALL THE FAST

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:44.160
WITH A HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:45.094
WHICH WE DID MY CLASSROOM MANY

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:47.363
TIMES. CAME HAVE ANOTHER

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:49.332
DOCUMENT AT THE SAME TIME THEY

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:52.702
FILL OUT. FOR CALAVERAS EXCEPT

01:02:52.768 --> 01:02:53.336
AROUND THAT SEEMS O ME TO BE A

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:56.339
NO BRAINER- NOW WE NEED TO ALSO

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:56.939
KNOWN AS I'VE HIGHLIGHTED IN

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:59.008
THE PAST. THERE WE HAVE A VERY

01:02:59.075 --> 01:02:59.876
WE HAVE A LOT OF UNDOCUMENTED

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.344
STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHO

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.745
DON'T FIND OUT TILL THE DAY OUT

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:03.746
THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO FELT A

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:05.581
FASTER. THEY ARE NOT DOCUMENT A

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:07.483
GO HOME. ONE DAY AND SAY I NEED

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.886
MY NUMBER. AND THEY COME BACK

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:12.088
THE NEXT DAY. WITHOUT A NUMBER.

01:03:12.155 --> 01:03:13.656
LEARNING FOR THE FIRST TIME.

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:14.524
THAT THEY ARE NOT DOCUMENTED

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:16.425
RIGHT AND IT'S A- LOT OF LOT OF

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:17.393
LOT OF STUFF GOING ON THERE HAS

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.961
BEEN THOSE THINGS OCCUR. TO ME

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:20.796
TO ACCOMMODATE THAT TO THE AB

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:22.098
FIVE EIGHTY STUFF FOR. MATURE

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:23.699
WAS EIGHTY SOMETHING OUT THERE

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:24.367
WITH THE STUDENTS FELT YOU KNOW

01:03:24.433 --> 01:03:26.402
THE- ACT BY FORTY SB FIVE FORTY

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.237
Và. SO I JUST THINK THERE'S A

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:30.239
WAY TO MAKE THIS PROCESS EASIER

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:32.608
I'LL BET. IT WOULD SAVE ON A

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:34.477
LOT OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.546
WELL. BECAUSE THERE'S GOT TO BE

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:37.914
YOU KNOW. PROBABLY MULTIPLE

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.182
PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE WORKING

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:40.183
FOR MULTIPLE PROGRAMS OF

01:03:40.249 --> 01:03:41.117
SOMEHOW WE COMBINE THESE

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:43.653
EFFORTS STREAMLINED THEM. AND

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:45.454
BRING IN SOME TECHNOLOGY MY

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:47.290
GUESS. I'M WILLING TO HEAR

01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:48.958
DIFFERENT. IS THAT THIS WOULD

SYSTEM MORE COMPLICATED. WE DO

01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:20.135
THINK THAT IN THE LONG TERM

IT MORE USEFUL FOR STATES

01:12:39.788 --> 01:12:40.956
IDENTIFYING STUDENTS WITH THE

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:43.325

FOR ADDITIONAL AID. WITHOUT

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:14.456
ATTENDING PRIVATE NONPROFIT

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:17.125
INSTITUTIONS- TO ME IS

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:19.628
CERTAINLY NOT EQUITABLE AND I

01:18:19.694 --> 01:18:20.896
BELIEVE THAT IF WE WANT TO

01:18:20.962 --> 01:18:22.464
SUPPORT STUDENTS IN THE HIGHEST

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.433

MANY STUDENTS WHO ARE QUALIFIED

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:41.216
ELIGIBLE IN THE DARK BECAUSE

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:43.218
THE COMPETITIVE ONE AND THEN

01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:44.653
IT'S SUPER COMPLICATED AND SELL

01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:46.855
THIS JUST I KNOW FOSTER YOUTH

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:48.290
ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEART

01:18:48.356 --> 01:18:49.991
JUST LIKE STUDENTS WITH PARENTS

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:51.660
ARE BUT FOR TWO YEARS IN A ROW.

01:18:51.726 --> 01:18:52.994
WE'RE MAKING THE COMPLICATED

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:54.596
CAL GRANT SAYS EVEN MORE

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:56.198
COMPLICATED AND NEXT YEAR IT

01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:58.266
WILL BE ANOTHER FOR THE STUDENT

01:18:58.333 --> 01:19:00.936
STUDENTS YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW WHO

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:02.370
HAVE COME FROM A DIFFERENT

01:19:02.437 --> 01:19:04.172
BACKGROUND OR DO YOU KNOW WHAT

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:05.574
WHATEVER WE WANT TO FOCUS ON

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:08.477
OTHER LCF PLUS TYPE STUDENTS-

01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:10.011

01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:11.580
TO DO THIS OR WE CAN JUST I

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:13.482
THINK CO MINGLE THIS MONEY AND

01:19:13.548 --> 01:19:16.051

DIFFERENCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION

01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:28.763
SO I THINK THAT WE SHOULD TAKE

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:31.032
A LOOK AT THAT AT THAT FOCUSING

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:32.901
ON CONSOLIDATING ALL THESE-

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:34.836
POTS OF MONEY SO WHILE I DO

FOR FOSTER YOUTH I DON'T KNOW

PARENTS AND WE- AS A SOCIETY AS

01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:05.734
CALIFORNIA NEED TO STEP UP TO

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.469
THE PLATE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:08.103
PROVIDING THEM WITH THE

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:10.972
FOUNDATION. WITH THE TOOLS-

01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:12.274

01:20:17.579 --> 01:20:18.947
LOVE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO

01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:21.349
CONSIDER EXPANDING THIS- FOR

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:22.083
PRIVATE COLLEGES AND

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:24.152
UNIVERSITIES. AS A YOUTH AND

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:25.720
PARTICULARLY A FOSTER YOUTH

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:26.588
WHEN YOU TURN EIGHTEEN YEARS

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.089
OLD YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:31.560
DIRECTION AND I STILL EVEN

01:20:31.626 --> 01:20:32.694
THOUGH OUR EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:35.063
FOSTER YOUTH ARE ADULTS I STILL

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.031
LOOK AT THEM AS GROWING

01:20:36.097 --> 01:20:38.433
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE YOUNG. AND

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.734
THAT MAKING THAT DECISION ON

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.770
WHERE TO GO TO COLLEGE IS A BIG

01:20:41.836 --> 01:20:43.271
DEAL AND THEY'RE LOOKING OUT

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:45.440
WHAT FITS THEM WHAT FITS THEIR

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.976
NEEDS AS A PERSON AND SOMETIMES

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:49.177
THAT'S OFFERED BY THE PRIVATE

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:50.512
UNIVERSITY OR NONPROFIT

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:52.380
UNIVERSITY SO I WOULD THINK

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:53.982
THAT REALLY TO GIVE THEM THE

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:55.183
FOUNDATIONAL START THAT THEY

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:56.785
NEED WE SHOULD EXPAND THE

01:20:56.851 --> 01:20:58.453
ELIGIBILITY THERE. JUST MY

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.189
COMMENT THERE. I DO HAVE A

01:21:01.256 --> 01:21:03.992
QUESTION WHAT ABOUT CAL GRANT

01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:05.927
ELIGIBILITY FOR FOSTER YOUTH-

01:21:05.994 --> 01:21:08.430

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:09.698
IN SECURING COMPETITIVE CAL

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:11.066
GRANT AWARDS WOULD THEY BE

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:13.101
ELIGIBLE FOR THIS AWARD OR IS

01:21:13.168 --> 01:21:17.539
IT LIMITED TO THOSE WHO RECEIVE

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:21.977
A CAL GRANT A. B. OR C. MMHM.

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:24.012
I'M A STUDENT WHO RECEIVED A

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:26.381
CARBON ABC EITHER AT THE

SOMEONE. SO I CAN I JUMP IN

01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:34.589
YEAH I THINK THAT AISES YOUR

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:36.491
ISSUE BECAUSE SO MANY OF OUR

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:38.293
FOSTER YOUTH HAVE. COUNTLESS

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.195
CHALLENGES WHEN THEY'RE

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:40.962
EIGHTEEN SO ARE THEY GOING TO

01:21:41.029 --> 01:21:42.831

FILL UP THAT FAST SO WHEN

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:46.635
THEY'RE SEVENTEEN. THIRD

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:48.536
FOCUSING WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO

01:21:48.603 --> 01:21:50.338
SIX SURVIVING WHEN THEY TURN

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:51.773
EIGHTEEN AND AGE OUT. SO THE

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.742
ODDS ARE THE STUDENTS. MAYBE A

01:21:53.808 --> 01:21:55.377

POOL WHERE THERE ARE CHANCES

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:02.817
ARE ONE IN FIVE AND SO THE

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:05.120
STUDENTS WHO WE THERE'S A FEW

01:22:05.186 --> 01:22:06.621
STUDENTS TO GET IN. WE'RE

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:08.523
GIVING THEM MORE SUPPORT WHICH

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:09.958
THEY DESPERATELY NEED BECAUSE

01:22:10.025 --> 01:22:12.060
THEY'RE THERE FOR THEIR NEED TO

01:22:12.127 --> 01:22:13.094
PAY FOR HOUSING AND EVERYTHING

01:22:13.161 --> 01:22:14.996
ELSE IS TREMENDOUS WE GET THAT.

01:22:15.063 --> 01:22:16.564
BUT BY DOING THAT YOU'RE GIVING

01:22:16.631 --> 01:22:18.967

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:26.408
IT'S A IT'S A BALANCING ACT AND

01:22:26.474 --> 01:22:27.375

THAT THE WISEST CHOICE. AND SO

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:35.684
I THINK THAT THAT BRINGS UP THE

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:36.851
POINT THAT WE NEED TO EVALUATE.

01:22:36.918 --> 01:22:37.786

ARE SPECIFIC- UP FOR DATE- AND

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:13.214
THAT IS THAT IS HEAT WITH THE

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:15.049
STATUS OF THE FORMER FOSTER

01:24:15.116 --> 01:24:16.684
YOUTH IN WHICH THEY NEEDED TO

01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:17.752
HAVE TO BE IN THE FOSTER

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:19.888
SYSTEM. THAT'S THE DATA THAT'S-

01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:21.122
THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER THIS

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:22.557
IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:24.626
SOCIAL SERVICES AND THAT WE USE

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:26.194
THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:27.829
FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.197
WHETHER A STUDENT MIGHT FIT-

01:24:29.264 --> 01:24:30.932
ELIGIBILITY FOR CHEAP YOU GRANT

CURRENT FOSTER YOUTH STUDENTS.

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:37.872
SO IN THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION

01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:39.707
IT WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON THE

01:24:39.774 --> 01:24:41.109
AGE AT WHICH THEY WERE ADOPTED

01:24:41.176 --> 01:24:43.344

THE ELIGIBILITY DEFINITION THAT

HERE THIS MONIES TO ENSURE

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:22.584

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:23.384

THIS ISSUE FROM WITHIN THE

SECTOR. AS NOTED EARLIER BY

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:38.632
ALEXIS FERNANDEZ THE PROGRAM

01:45:38.699 --> 01:45:40.367
WAS DESIGNED ORIGINALLY TO KEEP

COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM ACCESSING

01:45:42.436 --> 01:45:44.838
FROM ACCESSING FOOD BENEFITS

231% ARE ACTUALLY RECEDING CAL

01:46:00.153 --> 01:46:02.022
CRAP THAT AFFECTS. SO THE

IT'S DEFINITELY A LONG STANDING

02:04:35.768 --> 02:04:37.603
ISSUE WITHIN ALL OUR COLLEGE

02:04:39.638 --> 02:04:41.841
BACK WHEN I WAS A DAVIS THESE

02:04:41.907 --> 02:04:44.844
BARRIERS WERE SO HIGH THAT THAT

02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:46.712
STUDENTS M. AND USING THEIR

PRIVATE MONEY ANDERSON FEES

02:04:48.414 --> 02:04:50.382
WOULD CREATE THEIR OWN PROGRAMS

02:04:50.449 --> 02:04:52.117
TO MEET THE NEED RATHER THAN

02:04:52.184 --> 02:04:53.786
GOING THROUGH THESE PRO THESE

02:04:53.853 --> 02:04:55.254
EXISTING PROGRAMS ARE LOBBYING

02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:56.722
FOR STATE FUNDS IF WE SAID WE

02:04:56.789 --> 02:04:58.257
DO IT THEMSELVES STUDENTS OFTEN

02:04:58.324 --> 02:05:00.159
TAX THEMSELVES JUST TO PROVIDE

YOUR OWN INTEGRITY IS

02:05:10.135 --> 02:05:11.403
COMPLETELY ANONYMIZED THERE

02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:13.105
WASN'T IT OBVIOUS COLLECTED

02:05:13.172 --> 02:05:13.772
BASICALLY ANONYMIZE IN VERY LOW

02:05:13.839 --> 02:05:16.742
BARRIER I'M GLAD THAT ALL THESE

02:05:16.809 --> 02:05:18.878
HE SEES ACT IS WORKING RIGHT

02:05:18.944 --> 02:05:20.613
NOW TO- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE-

02:05:20.679 --> 02:05:22.047
OF THE LOWER BARRIERS RIGHT NOW

02:05:22.114 --> 02:05:23.449
AND MAKING SURE THAT. ELIGIBLE

02:05:23.515 --> 02:05:24.783
STUDENTS ARE NOTIFIED I THINK

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:26.151
THAT IS INCREDIBLE THAT IS A

02:05:26.218 --> 02:05:27.052
GREAT WORK WE SHOULD BE DOING

02:05:27.119 --> 02:05:28.687
TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE GET THAT

02:05:28.754 --> 02:05:29.889
THE LONG TERM OBVIOUSLY I'M

02:05:29.955 --> 02:05:31.023
WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO BE

02:05:31.090 --> 02:05:32.458
ELIMINATING. THE BERRIES

02:05:32.524 --> 02:05:33.792
ALTOGETHER AT THE FEDERAL

02:05:33.859 --> 02:05:36.929
LEVEL. I MEAN I THINK- CALFRESH

02:05:36.996 --> 02:05:39.098
OR- FOOD INSECURITY OF THE

02:05:39.164 --> 02:05:40.833
ISSUE ITSELF IS ALMOST. AN

02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:42.835
EPITOME OF THE OR GOOD

02:05:42.902 --> 02:05:44.570
METAPHOR. OR ELSE ARE GOOD

02:05:44.637 --> 02:05:45.871
ILLUSTRATION OF THE PROBLEM OR

02:05:45.938 --> 02:05:47.006
TALK ABOUT HIS COMMITTEE I

02:05:47.072 --> 02:05:48.173
REALLY APPRECIATE THE GREAT

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:49.842
DIALOGUE ABOUT WE HAVE SUCH A

02:05:49.909 --> 02:05:51.377
COMPLICATED SUCH AND TANGLED

02:05:51.443 --> 02:05:52.845
SYSTEM OF MEANS TESTING OF YOU

02:05:52.912 --> 02:05:54.079
HAVE TO BE THIS IF THE THAT YOU

02:05:54.146 --> 02:05:56.181
FEEL THESE FORMS. AND THAT IS

02:05:56.248 --> 02:05:57.316
INDICATIVE OF A LARGER PROBLEM

02:05:57.383 --> 02:05:58.684
WE HAVE THIS COUNTRY RIGHT WILL

02:05:58.751 --> 02:06:01.086
BE MAKE IT. ALMOST SO DIFFICULT

02:06:01.153 --> 02:06:02.755
TO BE POOR IN THIS COUNTRY WE

02:06:02.821 --> 02:06:04.323
MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT ACCESS THE

02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:05.925
RESOURCES THAT WE COLLECTIVELY

02:06:05.991 --> 02:06:07.059
PULLED TOGETHER FOR EACH OTHER.

02:06:07.126 --> 02:06:08.527
AND THIS IS SHOWN VERY CLEARLY

02:06:08.594 --> 02:06:11.363
JUST IN FOOD INSECURITY RIGHT.

02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:12.364
I MEAN A LOT OF THESE. PROGRAMS

02:06:12.431 --> 02:06:13.933
WE CREATED FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS

02:06:13.999 --> 02:06:15.734
WAS BACK WHEN. THE BUYING POWER

02:06:15.801 --> 02:06:16.835
OF MINIMUM WAGE IS MUCH

02:06:16.902 --> 02:06:18.570
STRONGER THAN YOUR BUYING POWER

02:06:18.637 --> 02:06:20.873
EVEN HIGHER YOUR- PART TIME JOB

02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:21.707
WITH A MINIMUM WAGE OF A

02:06:21.774 --> 02:06:23.108
STRONGER. HOUSING COSTS ARE

02:06:23.175 --> 02:06:24.643
MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE FORMAL AND

02:06:24.710 --> 02:06:26.679
BOXING KOSTER LEFT ARM. EVERY

02:06:26.745 --> 02:06:28.614
DAY. SO THESE ARE THE REAL

02:06:28.681 --> 02:06:29.748
DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE BY

02:06:29.815 --> 02:06:30.516
SINCE RIGHT NOW WHERE THEY

02:06:30.582 --> 02:06:32.084
CHOOSE TO HAVE A MALE. BUT THEY

02:06:32.151 --> 02:06:34.053
CHOOSE TO PAY FOR THE RENT. OR

02:06:34.119 --> 02:06:34.853
SOMETHING ELSE THAT THEY NEED

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:36.288
TO SURVIVE IS SO DIFFICULT

02:06:36.355 --> 02:06:37.623
RIGHT NOW SO I'M GLAD THAT HE'S

02:06:37.690 --> 02:06:38.724
I GUESS TAKING THIS URGENT

02:06:38.791 --> 02:06:40.025
ACTION RIGHT NOW NOTIFYING IT

02:06:40.092 --> 02:06:42.027
SO. AWFUL TO BE A PARTNER IN

02:06:42.094 --> 02:06:43.562
THIS ASPECT BUT I THINK IT IS.

02:06:43.629 --> 02:06:44.863
ILLUSTRATIVE TO THIS COMMITTEE

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:46.999
AND- IN OUR FRUSTRATION ABOUT

02:06:47.066 --> 02:06:48.801
HOW COMPLICATED THINGS ARE. AND

02:06:48.867 --> 02:06:50.302
HOPEFULLY WE'LL KEEP UNTANGLING

02:06:50.369 --> 02:06:51.370
AND SIMPLIFYING STREAMLINING

02:06:51.437 --> 02:06:53.172
THINGS. IN OUR APPROACH TO MAKE

02:06:53.238 --> 02:06:54.440

02:06:54.506 --> 02:06:56.175
ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE AND- BE

02:06:56.241 --> 02:06:58.911
SIMPLIFIED THAT WAY. SO JUST

02:06:58.978 --> 02:07:03.148
LIKE HOW. OKAY FOR THE

02:07:03.215 --> 02:07:06.618
QUESTIONS. DISTRESS NOT SO MUCH

02:07:06.685 --> 02:07:08.087
OF COURSE BUT THE COME THAT

02:07:08.153 --> 02:07:10.990
OFTENTIMES IS LEGISLATORS WE

02:07:11.056 --> 02:07:13.058

02:07:16.962 --> 02:07:19.431
MY COLLEAGUE HAS INDICATED WE

02:07:19.498 --> 02:07:20.866
SHOULD NOT BE TALKING ABOUT TO

02:14:00.298 --> 02:14:01.700
SAID ABOUT THE HIGH COST OF

02:14:01.767 --> 02:14:04.536
COLLEGE. IN COMBINATION

02:14:04.603 --> 02:14:07.906
BALANCING WORK AND STUDIES WAS

02:14:07.973 --> 02:14:08.774
OUR BIGGEST CONCERN. IN WAKE OF

02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:10.542
THE PANDEMIC MINISTER

02:14:10.609 --> 02:14:11.076
ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM THE

02:14:11.143 --> 02:14:12.677
LOWEST INCOME BACKGROUNDS ARE

02:14:12.744 --> 02:14:13.845
QUESTIONING WHETHER THE COST OF

02:14:13.912 --> 02:14:15.814
COLLEGES BEYOND REACH. AND

02:14:15.881 --> 02:14:16.915
THESE ARE THE STUDENTS WHO ARE

02:14:16.982 --> 02:14:19.217
MOST AT RISK OF DROPPING OUT OR

02:14:19.284 --> 02:14:20.118
NEVER STARTED COLLEGE TO BEGIN

02:14:20.185 --> 02:14:22.587
WITH AND WE STARTED TO SEE SOME

02:14:22.654 --> 02:14:23.789
OF THE CRIMES IN OCCUPATIONS AT

02:14:23.855 --> 02:14:26.191
VARIOUS. COLLEGES AND

02:14:26.258 --> 02:14:27.926
UNIVERSITIES. BUT AT THE TIME

02:14:27.993 --> 02:14:29.494
THE STATE NEEDS MORE HIGH

02:14:29.561 --> 02:14:31.530
SKILLED COVERED STUDENTS IN THE

02:14:31.596 --> 02:14:33.365
WORK FORCE TO TURN THIS ECONOMY

02:14:33.432 --> 02:14:35.634
AROUND. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE

02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:36.701
A WHOLE GENERATION OF COLLEGE

02:14:36.768 --> 02:14:40.172
STUDENTS. BECAUSE THE COST IS

02:14:40.238 --> 02:14:41.506
PROHIBITED IN THE EXPENSE THAT.

02:14:41.573 --> 02:14:42.507
SO IF YOU'RE OUT OF DIFFERENT

02:14:42.574 --> 02:14:43.975
MATERIALS NOTED THE

02:14:44.042 --> 02:14:45.410

SUPPORTING STUDENT NEEDS ARE

02:14:48.914 --> 02:14:50.849
NOT NEW. BUT GIVEN THE

02:14:50.916 --> 02:14:53.084
INCREASING COST OF ATTENDANCE

02:14:53.151 --> 02:14:54.019
AND THE COST OF LIVING IN

02:14:54.085 --> 02:14:56.354
CALIFORNIA THESE PROBLEMS HAVE

QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID. AND

02:16:20.171 --> 02:16:22.173
IT ALSO REDUCES THE LEVELS OF

02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:23.608
DEBT INCURRED BY STUDENTS

02:16:23.675 --> 02:16:25.577

TOGETHER TO MEET THE TOTAL COST

02:16:47.532 --> 02:16:50.735

02:16:50.802 --> 02:16:51.503
SO THIS EQUITY FRAMEWORK

02:16:53.405 --> 02:16:55.140

LARGELY BEING SOME OF OUR

IN FACT THAT TEN PEOPLE

02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:31.843

02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:33.778
THAT LEAVES THE MAJORITY OF

HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THEM WOULD

02:30:11.736 --> 02:30:13.304

AND AGAIN WE WANTED TO SHARE-

02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:31.021

THINK THAT THERE ARE STILL

02:30:36.894 --> 02:30:38.696
SIGNIFICANT- SHIFT TOWARDS

02:30:38.763 --> 02:30:40.731
GREATER INCLUSION PARTICULARLY

02:30:40.798 --> 02:30:43.067
FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND ARE

CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM I CAN

02:30:47.838 --> 02:30:49.707

CHANGES SO THAT. THIS PROGRAM

02:30:56.747 --> 02:30:58.115
WOULD PICK OFF PICK UP RIGHT

02:30:58.182 --> 02:30:59.116
WHERE THE CULPRIT FOR

02:30:59.183 --> 02:31:01.318
ELIGIBILITY ENDS I'M AND THAT

02:31:01.385 --> 02:31:02.920
WE WOULD AS WE MOVE FROM INCOME

02:31:02.987 --> 02:31:04.922
ASSET FEELINGS ON OUR CAL GRANT

02:31:04.989 --> 02:31:06.490
PROGRAMS THAT WE WOULD DO THE

02:31:06.557 --> 02:31:07.291
SAME FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS

02:31:07.358 --> 02:31:09.527
SCHOLARSHIP. AND SHIPPED BACK

02:31:11.195 --> 02:31:13.764
CONTRIBUTION FOR ELIGIBILITY-

02:31:13.831 --> 02:31:15.166
SUCH THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO

02:31:15.232 --> 02:31:16.834
PROVIDE A PERCENTAGE OF TUITION

02:31:16.901 --> 02:31:19.003
COVERAGE JUST UNITS BASED ON

02:31:19.069 --> 02:31:21.172
THEIR EFC. I'M AND WE ALSO

02:31:21.238 --> 02:31:22.306
BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SOME

02:31:22.373 --> 02:31:24.442
VALUABLE- IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN

02:31:24.508 --> 02:31:25.843
MAKE TO ADMINISTRATION ON THIS

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:27.344
PROGRAM IN FUNCTIONS OF THE

LAST DOLLAR PROGRAM WHICH MEANS

02:31:29.513 --> 02:31:30.481
WE'RE TRACKING STUDENT

02:31:30.548 --> 02:31:31.682
FINANCIAL AID PACKAGES

02:31:31.749 --> 02:31:32.917
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE ACADEMIC

02:31:32.983 --> 02:31:34.752
YEAR. AND ACTUALLY CREATE THE

02:31:34.819 --> 02:31:37.087
POSSIBILITY THAT- IN THE AUGUST

02:31:37.154 --> 02:31:38.322

A DEFINED. PERCENTAGE AT THE

02:31:46.430 --> 02:31:47.531
START OF THE YEAR. I MENTIONED

02:31:47.598 --> 02:31:48.432
EARLIER THE ROLE OF

02:31:48.499 --> 02:31:50.568
INSTITUTIONAL AID- THAT WE SEE

02:31:50.634 --> 02:31:53.237
UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK- AND- WHAT

02:31:53.304 --> 02:31:55.372
WE WOULD AGAIN PROPOSES THAT

02:31:55.439 --> 02:31:57.508
ZERO ESE STUDENTS- AND ROLLED.

02:31:57.575 --> 02:31:58.709
OUT ORG UNIVERSITIES BE

02:31:58.776 --> 02:32:00.678
ELIGIBLE FOR INSTITUTIONAL AID

02:32:00.744 --> 02:32:02.580
TO SUPPORT THEIR BASIC NEEDS.

02:32:02.646 --> 02:32:04.148
THIS IS POSSIBLE IN PART

02:32:04.215 --> 02:32:06.050
BECAUSE OF SIGNIFICANT

02:32:06.116 --> 02:32:07.485
INSTITUTIONAL AID RESOURCES

02:32:07.551 --> 02:32:09.487
PARTICULARLY AT THE CSU ARE

02:32:09.553 --> 02:32:11.589
BEING UTILIZED TO FILL HOLES IN

02:32:11.655 --> 02:32:12.656
THE COVERAGE OF THE CAL GRANT

02:34:57.688 --> 02:34:59.023
THAT DOES COME WITH A ONE TIME

02:35:20.144 --> 02:35:22.012
OTHER- IMPORTANT POLICIES THAT

02:35:22.079 --> 02:35:24.281

GO UP THERE IS CURRENTLY NO-

02:35:42.866 --> 02:35:44.902
MECHANISM FOR OUR ACCESS AWARDS

02:35:44.968 --> 02:35:46.704
FOR NON TUITION COSTS- TO

INCREASE AS THOSE EXPENSES DO

02:35:48.305 --> 02:35:50.040

I'M WITH THE COST OF LIVING-

02:35:51.975 --> 02:35:54.344
ISSUES FACING OUR STUDENTS- SO

02:35:54.411 --> 02:35:55.446

WOULD. HELP ADDRESS THIS

02:36:04.688 --> 02:36:05.823
INEQUITY IN COULD. ZERO OF THE

EXTERMINATOR HAS SUPPORTED

02:36:10.461 --> 02:36:12.863
RESTORATION OF A FORMULA AWARD-

02:36:12.930 --> 02:36:14.198
FOR GRANTS TO STUDENTS ENROLLED

02:36:14.264 --> 02:36:15.499
AT A PRIVATE NONPROFIT

02:36:15.566 --> 02:36:17.534
INSTITUTIONS. AND WE ALSO

02:36:17.601 --> 02:36:19.837
BELIEVE THAT THE BILL ABILITY

02:36:19.903 --> 02:36:21.672
OF. L. GRANT FOR SUMMER

02:36:21.739 --> 02:36:23.173

TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC YEAR. SO

02:36:34.151 --> 02:36:35.986
WE THINK THAT'S ALSO A VERY

02:36:36.053 --> 02:36:38.822
WORTHWHILE CONSIDERATION. THE

02:36:38.889 --> 02:36:40.290
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF OR SEE

FOR A PELL GRANT WILL RECEIVE A

02:36:59.610 --> 02:37:01.612
HIGHER REWARD- IT DOES REQUIRE

THAT BEING SAID. I'M WE DON'T

THINK THAT THEY'LL BE ANY-

02:37:08.952 --> 02:37:10.788
SHIFT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH THAT

02:37:10.854 --> 02:37:11.855

POLICY MAKERS CREATES AN

02:37:22.199 --> 02:37:24.034

AS WELL AS WELL AS- THE

02:46:49.666 --> 02:46:50.934
CORRESPONDING ON MIDDLE CLASS

02:46:52.435 --> 02:46:53.536
COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH HAS

02:47:01.044 --> 02:47:01.644
COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THIS

02:47:01.711 --> 02:47:04.814
ISSUE- TO HOPEFULLY. PUTTING A

02:47:04.881 --> 02:47:07.183
DOWN PAYMENT. INTO IN IN

02:47:07.250 --> 02:47:09.953
SPENDING- THE CAL GRANT

02:47:10.019 --> 02:47:11.654
FINANCIALLY SYSTEM CALIFORNIA.

02:47:11.721 --> 02:47:13.857
ARE FOCUSING ON ON NON TUITION

02:47:13.923 --> 02:47:15.792
COSTS I THINK THAT'S THE- AT

02:47:15.859 --> 02:47:17.327
THE CRUX HERE IS HOW DO WE MAKE

02:47:17.394 --> 02:47:20.063
SURE THAT WE- FOCUS ON THE

02:47:20.130 --> 02:47:21.331
REALITY OF THE COLLEGE STUDENTS

02:47:21.398 --> 02:47:23.433
TODAY. IT'S YOU KNOW. THE CAL

02:47:23.500 --> 02:47:25.802
GRANT IS A GREAT- SYSTEM WE'VE

02:47:25.869 --> 02:47:27.604
HAD FOR DECADES HERE WHO MADE

02:47:27.670 --> 02:47:28.638
ENTITLEMENT TWENTY ONE YEARS

02:47:28.705 --> 02:47:31.107
AGO. BUT THE COST OF COLLEGE OR

02:47:31.174 --> 02:47:32.442
ARE GENETICALLY CHANGED BY THE

02:47:32.509 --> 02:47:34.344
HOUSING COSTS IN TRANSPORTATION

02:47:34.411 --> 02:47:36.579
IN BOOKS AND- FOOD AND SO FORTH

02:47:36.646 --> 02:47:37.380
SO THE QUESTION IS VERY

02:47:37.447 --> 02:47:39.649
DIFFERENT AND SO. ARE OUR VIEW

02:47:39.716 --> 02:47:42.786
IS- HOW YOU COULD MAKE COLLEGE.

02:47:42.852 --> 02:47:44.487
MORE AFFORDABLE AND FRANKLY

02:47:44.554 --> 02:47:47.424
DEBT FREE IN CALIFORNIA SO.

02:47:47.490 --> 02:47:48.191
THERE'S ANOTHER LIGHT

02:47:48.258 --> 02:47:49.459
CONVERSATION ABOUT FREE COLLEGE

02:47:49.526 --> 02:47:51.494
ACROSS OUR NATION BUT- I THINK

02:47:51.561 --> 02:47:53.263
THE REAL EQUATION IS HOW WE CAN

02:47:53.329 --> 02:47:55.031
FOCUS ON MAKING IT A DEBT FREE

02:47:55.098 --> 02:47:57.634
SO. OF COURSE THE STUDENTS AND

02:47:57.700 --> 02:47:58.601
THEIR FAMILIES DEPEND ON THEIR

02:47:58.668 --> 02:48:00.570
INCOME HAVE SOME EXPECTED. THAT

02:48:00.637 --> 02:48:03.306
CONTRIBUTION COUPLED WITH.

FINANCIAL AID FROM THE FEDERAL

02:48:05.275 --> 02:48:05.742
STATE GOVERNMENT WE REALLY

02:48:05.809 --> 02:48:07.977
COULD MAKE IT. FEASIBLE FOR

02:48:08.044 --> 02:48:09.446
STUDENTS TO GRADUATE WITH

02:48:09.512 --> 02:48:11.014
MINIMAL DEBT AND I THINK YOU

02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:17.086

FROM WHERE WE'RE AT NOW. MCS

02:50:43.733 --> 02:50:45.201
THIS LIMITED BASICALLY BY THE

02:50:45.268 --> 02:50:48.638
AMOUNT OF THE PROGRAM- AND WE-

02:50:48.705 --> 02:50:50.740
SPLIT IT UP. YOU KNOW STARTING

02:50:50.807 --> 02:50:53.042
BASED UPON WHERE WHERE IT

02:50:53.109 --> 02:50:54.811
BEGINS IN THE INCOME LEVEL AND

02:50:54.877 --> 02:50:56.579
MOVING TO THE RIGHT UNTIL WE

02:50:56.646 --> 02:50:58.982
EXHAUST ALL THE MONEY. SO I

02:50:59.048 --> 02:51:00.249
WOULD ANTICIPATE THERE BEING

02:51:00.316 --> 02:51:03.586
ANY. DRAMATIC CHANGES THE

02:51:03.653 --> 02:51:04.187

02:51:05.888 --> 02:51:07.056
HEARD IS THAT THERE IS I HAVE

02:51:07.123 --> 02:51:08.625
HEARD CONCERNED THAT THIS IS

02:51:08.691 --> 02:51:11.461
KIND OF THE SLOW KILL. ARE YOU

02:51:11.527 --> 02:51:13.196
KNOW AN ATTACK ON THE MISSION

02:51:13.262 --> 02:51:14.464
OF THE LITTLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP

02:51:14.530 --> 02:51:16.099
SO- I'LL BE WATCHING THIS CLOSE

02:51:16.165 --> 02:51:17.734
AND TWO OTHERS WILL. APPRECIATE

02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:19.636
YOUR FEEDBACK ON T. BUT I

02:51:19.702 --> 02:51:20.637
THINK IT OUT OF THE GATE DOES

02:51:20.703 --> 02:51:21.571
STRIKE ME AS A CUT TO THE

02:51:21.638 --> 02:51:23.940
PROGRAM. OR AN IMPACT IN THE

02:51:24.007 --> 02:51:25.608
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WILL SERVE.

02:51:25.675 --> 02:51:28.011
LISTEN TO THE PERSPECTIVE I

02:51:28.077 --> 02:51:29.746
HAVE AS CALIFORNIA DOES LITTLE

02:51:29.812 --> 02:51:31.314
VERY LITTLE FOR THE MIDDLE

02:51:31.381 --> 02:51:33.416
CLASS AND THIS IS ONE PROGRAM.

02:51:33.483 --> 02:51:34.717
ACTUALLY DOES HELP THE MIDDLE

02:51:34.784 --> 02:51:36.619
CLASS. SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

02:51:36.686 --> 02:51:38.354
TO ME THAT WE SUSTAIN IT. AND

02:51:38.421 --> 02:51:41.658
THAT IT NOT BE TAMPED DOWN-

02:51:41.724 --> 02:51:45.228
CUT. OR OR JUST- YOU KNOW. NOT

02:51:45.294 --> 02:51:47.363
MEET ITS ORIGINAL INTENT OR

02:51:47.430 --> 02:51:49.232
MISSION. SO I THANK YOU FOR THE

02:51:49.298 --> 02:51:50.466
FEEDBACK ON THAT I'LL BE

02:51:50.533 --> 02:51:51.467
WATCHING THIS ISSUE AND OTHERS

02:51:51.534 --> 02:51:52.702
WILL. VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE I

02:51:52.769 --> 02:51:53.603
THINK THE MIDDLE CLASS

02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:56.472
SCHOLARSHIP SOMETHING WE NEED

02:51:56.539 --> 02:51:57.106
TO EXPAND ON. NOT CONTRACT WITH

02:51:57.173 --> 02:52:02.345
THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU THE

02:52:02.412 --> 02:52:03.880
CAN WE JUST DIG IN A LITTLE BIT

02:52:03.946 --> 02:52:05.481
DEEPER ON THIS MIDDLE CLASS

02:52:05.548 --> 02:52:08.051
SCHOLARSHIP ISSUE. COM IT'S NOT

02:52:08.117 --> 02:52:11.654
JUST- MISTER O'DONNELL I AM

02:52:11.721 --> 02:52:12.255
COMMITTED TO CONTINUE I THINK

02:52:12.321 --> 02:52:15.191
IT WAS A GREAT IDEA LAUNCHED BY

02:52:15.258 --> 02:52:17.527
OUR FORMER SPEAKER JOHN PEREZ

02:52:17.593 --> 02:52:19.662
NOW ARE CHAIR THE UC REGENTS.

02:52:19.729 --> 02:52:21.597
AND I THINK IT DOES ACKNOWLEDGE

02:52:21.664 --> 02:52:23.499
THAT THERE ARE STUDENTS WHO IT

02:52:23.566 --> 02:52:25.601
SOUNDS LIKE YOU YOU KNOW PEOPLE

02:52:25.668 --> 02:52:27.837
MAKE OVER A HUNDRED. RAND ARE

02:52:27.904 --> 02:52:29.338
ARE SET BUT WE KNOW THAT THAT'S

02:52:29.405 --> 02:52:31.240
NOT TRUE YOU CAN BE A TEACHER

02:52:31.307 --> 02:52:33.209
AND A NURSE OR FIREFIGHTER- YOU

02:52:33.276 --> 02:52:35.044
KNOW PUBLIC SERVICE WORKER. AND

02:52:35.111 --> 02:52:36.746
LIVE IN A HIGH COST AREA AND

02:52:36.813 --> 02:52:38.147
YOU CERTAINLY ARE NOT ARE NOT

02:52:38.214 --> 02:52:40.783
RICH AND SO- AND I THINK THAT

02:52:40.850 --> 02:52:42.351
IT WAS A FAIR PROPOSAL THAT

02:52:42.418 --> 02:52:44.987
DOESN'T COVER. THE FULL TUITION

02:52:45.054 --> 02:52:46.522
UNDER THE CAL GRANT BUT IT

02:52:46.589 --> 02:52:49.525
COVERS- A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF

02:52:49.592 --> 02:52:52.261
THE TUITION FOR UC AND CSU. SO

STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM. IT

02:53:59.262 --> 02:54:00.696

SAME THING WHICH IS HOW DO WE

02:55:22.078 --> 02:55:26.082

AND WE WANT TO SIMPLIFY THE

02:55:31.621 --> 02:55:33.389
PROCESS EVERYBODY'S BEEN SAYING

02:55:33.456 --> 02:55:37.059

ANOTHER ALMOST SAFETY NET

02:55:48.738 --> 02:55:52.642
PROGRAM AND AS- THE- WHERE

02:55:52.708 --> 02:55:53.743
WE'RE GONNA COVER THINGS THAT

02:55:53.809 --> 02:55:55.711
AREN'T NECESSARILY RELATED TO

02:55:55.778 --> 02:55:59.315
LIVING EXPENSES YOU KNOW.

02:55:59.382 --> 02:56:01.684

EVERYTHING ON A- TOTAL COST OF

REPORT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGES ARE

02:56:12.595 --> 02:56:14.864
NON EDUCATIONAL LIVING EXPENSES.

02:56:14.931 --> 02:56:15.631
WHICH I THINK COULD HAVE THE

02:56:15.698 --> 02:56:17.099
INCENTIVE OF PEOPLE THE SAME

02:56:17.166 --> 02:56:18.968
WAY I WANT TO GET SUPPORT.

02:56:19.035 --> 02:56:19.936

DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT WE WANT

02:56:29.412 --> 02:56:30.246
TO DO I DON'T WANT TO CREATE

02:56:30.313 --> 02:56:31.414
THAT KIND OF INCENTIVE THE

02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:32.748
INCENTIVE IS HEY I WANT TO GET

02:56:32.815 --> 02:56:34.116

02:56:34.183 --> 02:56:35.551
MEETING EDUCATIONAL GOALS IT

02:56:35.618 --> 02:56:38.321
NEEDS ANOTHER WORDS. THEY

02:56:38.387 --> 02:56:40.890
SHOULD BE MORE OUTCOME BASED.

02:56:40.957 --> 02:56:42.458
IN OUR LOOKING AT THIS AS

02:56:42.525 --> 02:56:44.794
OPPOSED TO JUST BASING IT ON

02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:49.899
INPUTS. OF BETTER ADMITTEDLY

02:56:49.966 --> 02:56:53.269
VERY EXPENSIVE- SO I GUESS

02:56:53.336 --> 02:56:54.503

STREAMLINED ACCESS FOR

02:57:01.644 --> 02:57:04.847
QUALIFIED STUDENTS- BUT I THINK

02:57:04.914 --> 02:57:06.215
WE BEST SERVE THE STUDENTS AND

02:57:06.282 --> 02:57:08.684
TAXPAYERS IF WE FOCUS OUR

02:57:08.751 --> 02:57:12.121

GENERAL NATIONAL TRENDS ARE-

03:01:45.194 --> 03:01:46.095
FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS

03:01:46.161 --> 03:01:48.330
YOUR HAVE A LARGER NUMBER OF

03:01:48.397 --> 03:01:50.966
STUDENTS WITH LOANS BUT THEIR

03:01:51.033 --> 03:01:52.301
LOAN AMOUNTS WILL BE SMALLER.

03:01:52.368 --> 03:01:54.036
AT FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS

03:01:54.103 --> 03:01:55.704
YOU'LL HAVE FEWER STUDENTS BUT

03:01:55.771 --> 03:01:57.039
THEIR AVERAGE LOAN AMOUNTS WILL

03:01:57.106 --> 03:01:59.308
BE LARGER ACROSS TE ACTUAL

03:01:59.375 --> 03:02:01.543
LARGEST LOAN AMOUNTS OF TEND TO

03:02:01.610 --> 03:02:02.544
BE ON THE BOOKS FOR STUDENTS

03:02:02.611 --> 03:02:03.846
WHO ARE GRAD STUDENTS WHO

03:02:03.912 --> 03:02:04.947
CUMULATE A LOT OF GRADUATE

03:02:05.014 --> 03:02:06.915
STUDENT DEBT SO. THERE'S A

03:02:06.982 --> 03:02:08.250
DIFFERENT BALANCE BETWEEN A LOT

03:02:08.317 --> 03:02:11.553
ALONG WITH A SMALL AMOUNT AND A

03:02:11.620 --> 03:02:13.589
FEW WITH A VERY LARGE AMOUNT.

03:02:13.656 --> 03:02:16.492
RIGHT RIGHT BUT BOTTOM LINE

03:02:16.558 --> 03:02:17.760
WHAT WE ARE SEEN AS A THERE'S A

03:02:17.826 --> 03:02:21.597
LOT OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS AT.

03:02:21.664 --> 03:02:23.599
WHAT ARE THE SE NON SI NON-

03:02:23.666 --> 03:02:25.134
COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTITUTIONS

03:02:28.304 --> 03:02:30.339
GOES TO MY POINT. I REALLY GET

IT DONE FOR THOSE STUDENTS

03:02:32.341 --> 03:02:35.210
RIGHT NOW. AND IF WE START

03:02:35.277 --> 03:02:37.813
ALLOCATING RESOURCES MORE. AND

03:02:37.880 --> 03:02:39.048
I'M NOT PICKING ON COMMUNITY

03:02:39.114 --> 03:02:40.949
COLLEGE COMMITTEE COLLEGES IS A

03:02:41.016 --> 03:02:42.084
GREAT SYSTEM OF BUT AGAIN I

03:02:42.151 --> 03:02:43.686

HIGH COST STATE TO LIVE IN AND

THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER

03:02:56.265 --> 03:02:58.334
DISCUSSION THAT WE CAN GET INTO

03:02:58.400 --> 03:02:59.802
AND EVERYBODY FACES THOSE

03:02:59.868 --> 03:03:02.271
LIVING COSTS- BUT IN TERMS OF

03:03:02.338 --> 03:03:03.939
THE COST OF THE EDUCATION

03:03:04.006 --> 03:03:05.674
ITSELF IS THE MOST. MOST

03:03:05.741 --> 03:03:09.545
AFFORDABLE IS MY POINT- I EXAM.

03:03:09.611 --> 03:03:12.281
AND GO AHEAD. RESPOND TO YOUR

03:03:12.348 --> 03:03:13.682

SERVE STUDENTS WHO DO HAVE

03:03:33.435 --> 03:03:35.070
THOSE BASIC ME CHALLENGES

03:03:35.137 --> 03:03:35.904
WHETHER THEY'RE AT THE FOUR

03:03:35.971 --> 03:03:37.306

COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THIS

03:03:38.907 --> 03:03:40.542

COMMUNITY COLLEGE SITE THAT'S

03:04:00.329 --> 03:04:01.597
PROBABLY THE AREA THAT THERE'S

03:04:01.663 --> 03:04:02.831
BEEN THE GREATEST CENTER

03:04:02.898 --> 03:04:04.600
INVESTMENT COMPARED TO THE FOR

03:04:04.666 --> 03:04:06.235
YOUR SITE WHICH IS WHY IT

03:04:18.981 --> 03:04:20.716
MANY OF THEM GET LEFT OUT BUT

03:04:20.783 --> 03:04:22.418
WE'RE NOT IGNORING THE NEEDS OF

03:04:22.484 --> 03:04:23.719
FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS AS A

03:04:23.786 --> 03:04:24.586
MATTER OF FACT A CRITICAL

03:04:24.653 --> 03:04:26.588
COMPONENT. OF THIS PROPOSAL IS

03:04:26.655 --> 03:04:28.223

LOWER INCOME SIDE GET SOME

03:04:35.864 --> 03:04:38.066
SUPPORT IN ADDITION TO JUST

03:04:38.133 --> 03:04:40.302

INSTITUTION BASED ON WHERE YOU

03:04:46.275 --> 03:04:48.110

PERSON WHO GOES TO YOU SEE. SO

03:04:59.087 --> 03:05:00.656
THAT'S WHY WE'RE REALLY LOOKING

03:05:00.722 --> 03:05:03.392
AT LIVING EXPENSES- NON TUITION

03:05:03.459 --> 03:05:05.260
COSTS IS A KEY COMPONENT OF

03:05:05.327 --> 03:05:07.029
UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT IS THAT

03:05:07.095 --> 03:05:08.831
STUDENTS NEED. TO ACTUALLY

TO ACCELERATE GRADUATION AND

03:05:24.079 --> 03:05:27.015
COMPLETION SO STUDENTS CAN MOVE

03:05:27.082 --> 03:05:29.852
ON INTO THE WORKPLACE. OKAY AND

03:05:29.918 --> 03:05:31.253
THEN JUST FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT

03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:32.354
YOU JUST SAID THERE WERE KIND

03:05:32.421 --> 03:05:34.523
OF LEVERAGING FEDERAL AND OTHER

YOU KNOW INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT.

03:05:36.458 --> 03:05:38.894
DO WE EXPECT THAT STUDENT MORE

03:05:38.961 --> 03:05:40.429
STUDENTS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR

03:05:40.496 --> 03:05:42.998
PELL GRANTS. AND CAL GRANTS

03:05:43.065 --> 03:05:44.633
BASED ON THE RECENT CHANGES TO

03:05:44.700 --> 03:05:49.638
FASTER. WELL THE RECENT CHANGES

03:05:49.705 --> 03:05:51.940
ARE PROPOSED FOR FASTER AND

03:05:52.007 --> 03:05:54.910
THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE UNTIL

03:05:54.977 --> 03:05:55.544
TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR BUT WE

03:05:55.611 --> 03:05:57.045
DO THINK BY MAKING IT EASIER TO

03:05:57.112 --> 03:05:58.847
APPLY MORE STUDENTS WILL LIKELY

03:05:58.914 --> 03:06:01.116
APPLY THE MORE IMMEDIATE

03:06:01.183 --> 03:06:03.852
CHANGES THAT WILL SEE- IN THE

03:06:03.919 --> 03:06:06.788
NEXT- THE NEXT- ACADEMIC

03:06:06.855 --> 03:06:07.990
FINANCIALLY CYCLE ARE THE

03:06:08.056 --> 03:06:09.658
CHANGES TO THE PELL GRANT

03:06:09.725 --> 03:06:11.393
ELIGIBILITY RIGHT AND THAT'S

03:06:11.460 --> 03:06:12.861
WHERE MY STAFF ARE WORKING

03:06:12.928 --> 03:06:14.363
DILIGENTLY RIGHT NOW TO FIGURE

03:06:14.429 --> 03:06:15.898
OUT EXACTLY WHAT THAT IMPACT

03:06:15.964 --> 03:06:17.733
IS. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT

03:06:17.799 --> 03:06:19.501
MORE STUDENTS WILL BE ELIGIBLE

03:06:19.568 --> 03:06:21.036
FOR FEDERAL AID AND THERE IS

03:06:21.103 --> 03:06:22.571
THE POTENTIAL TO EVEN INCREASE

03:06:22.638 --> 03:06:24.806
THE AMOUNT OF PELL GRANT AID

03:06:24.873 --> 03:06:27.976
WHICH CURRENTLY IS ABOUT. SIX

03:06:28.043 --> 03:06:29.444
THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY

03:06:29.511 --> 03:06:30.913
THOUSAND A YEAR FOR A VERY LOW

03:06:30.979 --> 03:06:32.981
INCOME STUDENTS AND THERE IS

03:06:33.048 --> 03:06:34.016
THE POTENTIAL FOR THAT TO

03:06:34.082 --> 03:06:35.717
INCREASE THE FOR EVERY STUDENT

03:06:35.784 --> 03:06:37.719
THAT QUALIFIES FOR PELL GRANT

03:06:37.786 --> 03:06:39.221
AID THAT'S LESS THAT THE STATE

03:06:39.288 --> 03:06:41.690
NEEDS TO PROVIDE BASIC NEEDS

03:06:41.757 --> 03:06:45.093
SUPPORT AT THE STATE LEVEL. ARE

03:06:45.160 --> 03:06:46.228
YOU HOPEFUL THE NEW CHAIN TO

03:06:46.295 --> 03:06:48.163
THE FEDERAL. ARE GOING TO DRAW

03:06:48.230 --> 03:06:49.998
MORE RESOURCES TO CALIFORNIA

03:06:50.065 --> 03:06:52.267
STUDENTS. OKAY AND THEN DOES

03:06:52.334 --> 03:06:54.236
THIS PROPOSAL CHANGE THE TOTAL

03:06:54.303 --> 03:06:57.306
YEARS OF CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY.
