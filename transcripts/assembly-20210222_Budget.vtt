ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT IF THEY

THEIR LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS.

00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:44.227
WILD BILL DOES NOT TAKE THAT

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:46.996
AWAY- BY SETTING UP A STANDARD

00:57:47.063 --> 00:57:48.631
OF AS YOU KNOW THE STATE

00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:50.733
REQUIRING RE OPENING- APPLE

00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:54.237
THOUSAND CASE RATE UPTICK OF

THE CASE RATE- AND BY SETTING A

00:57:58.308 --> 00:58:00.310
DATE OF APRIL FIFTEENTH. IN

00:58:00.376 --> 00:58:02.178
PRACTICAL TERMS WHAT THAT CAN

00:58:02.245 --> 00:58:06.516
DO IS THAT CAN- LEAD TO- SCHOOL

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:08.218
DISTRICT AND- THEIR LABOR

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:10.053
PARTNERS HAVING TO SIT BACK

00:58:10.119 --> 00:58:11.855

00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:13.356
ABOUT YOU KNOW WHY ARE WE OPEN

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:15.058
NOW IF THE IF THE STATE IS ONLY

00:58:15.124 --> 00:58:18.795
REQUIRING- THAT WE THAT WE GO

UNTIL APRIL FIFTEENTH SO I

00:58:22.232 --> 00:58:24.500
THINK THAT WHILE. AND THE BILL

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:26.269
DOES NOT PROVIDE THAT YOU KNOW

00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:28.171
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK AND

00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:30.206
LOOK AGAIN AT YOUR AGREEMENT

00:58:30.273 --> 00:58:31.541
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE

00:58:31.608 --> 00:58:34.577
PRACTICAL REALITY IS THAT MANY-

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:35.745
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE

00:58:35.812 --> 00:58:37.480
ALREADY OPEN OR HAVE PLANNED TO

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:39.015
OPEN BEFORE APRIL FIFTEENTH OR

00:58:39.082 --> 00:58:42.185
IN PURPLE. MAY FIND THAT THEY

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:44.320
ARE AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU

00:58:44.387 --> 00:58:45.588
KNOW HAVING TO SIT BACK DOWN TO

00:58:45.655 --> 00:58:47.323
RENEGOTIATE THOSE AGREEMENTS

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:52.462
AND DUE. TO THE SETTING OF THE

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:53.429
STANDARD. THE SILVER COULD JUST

00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:55.498
FALL UP JUST. AT THE PATRICIA

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:56.766
MEAN THESE UNINTENDED

00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:58.568
CONSEQUENCE. HAVE HAVE A REAL

00:58:58.635 --> 00:59:01.938
FACT IF THIS. DOES LEAD TO

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:03.907
SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO ARE TRYING

00:59:03.973 --> 00:59:06.075
TO OPEN THE DELAYS THAT SO HOW

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:08.978
WOULD THAT BE RESULT. IN FROM

00:59:09.045 --> 00:59:15.151
THE MEDICATIONS PRESCRIBED.

00:59:15.218 --> 00:59:17.453
PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON REOPENING

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.489
MORE QUICKLY AND BECAUSE OUR

00:59:19.555 --> 00:59:21.591
PROPOSAL ALLOWED THEN AND IN

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:23.860
FACT THAT THE MINIMUM STANDARD-

00:59:23.927 --> 00:59:26.429
RE OPENING IN PURPLE FOR FULL

00:59:26.496 --> 00:59:28.731
GRADE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:30.867
IS SUPPORTED- AGREEMENTS THAT

00:59:30.934 --> 00:59:32.235
ARE ALREADY IN PLACE AND

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:33.836
THEREFORE DOESN'T SATISFY AYE

00:59:33.903 --> 00:59:35.171
DIFFERENT STANDARDS THAT WOULD

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:37.573
FORCE- FOLKS HIT TO LOOK AGAIN

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.042
AT THEIR AGREEMENT SO I THINK

00:59:39.108 --> 00:59:40.209
THAT WE STILL VERY STRONGLY

00:59:40.276 --> 00:59:41.778
THAT FULL GRAYSON PURPLE AS

00:59:41.844 --> 00:59:44.547
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- IT IS.

00:59:44.614 --> 00:59:49.452
VERY IMPORTANT AND. SHIPPED TO

00:59:49.519 --> 00:59:49.953
PROTECT AT THE EXISTING

00:59:50.019 --> 00:59:51.487
AGREEMENT. N. SAID THE- SO I

00:59:51.554 --> 00:59:53.189
UNDERSTAND REAR A LOT ALLOWING

00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:54.457
AS GOOD AS IT TO OPEN IN FOR

00:59:54.524 --> 00:59:57.360
BOTH THE THRESHOLD IS TWENTY

00:59:57.427 --> 00:59:57.894
FIVE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND.

00:59:57.961 --> 01:00:00.763
CORRECT. BOARD CENTER AND WOOD

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:16.312
REQUIREMENT FOR TEACHERS AND

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:17.647
OTHER SCHOOL OR DISTRICT STAFF

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.449
TO BE VACCINATED BEFORE A

01:00:19.515 --> 01:00:20.249
SCHOOL CAN OFFER IN PERSON

01:00:20.316 --> 01:00:22.452
INSTRUCTION. CAN YOU OFFER THAT

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:22.919

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:24.554
CLARIFICATION ON THAT THANK YOU

MEMBER- AND JUST BEFORE I GET

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:28.958

REITERATE THAT THE CONCERNED

01:00:31.627 --> 01:00:33.663
ABOUT A MOVING TARGET AROUND

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:34.998
UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS AND WHEN

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:36.599
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN OPEN

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:37.900
HAS BEEN A POINT OF CONTENTION

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:39.769
SINCE THE NEW CD PH GUIDANCE

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:41.671
WAS ISSUED IN JANUARY. THE NEW

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:43.139
GUIDANCE WAS EXTREMELY MORE

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:44.974
FIRM AND STRICT THAN ALL PRIOR

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:46.843
GUIDANCE AND HAS CREATED A

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:47.944
CASCADE EFFECT OF HARD

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:49.445
CONVERSATIONS AT THE LOCAL

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:51.447

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:57.887
GUIDANCE SO. UNDER CURRENT LAW

01:00:57.954 --> 01:00:59.789
THERE IS NO MINIMUM STANDARD

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:01.057
FOR WHEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.825
HAS TO OPEN SO THE DIFFERENCE

01:01:02.892 --> 01:01:03.893
BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.862

TWELVE STUDENT GROUPS THAT

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:15.038
WOULD BECOME A REQUIREMENT IN

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:16.706
PURPLE REGARDLESS OF THE CASE

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:17.774
RATE SO THAT OUR MOST

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.642
VULNERABLE STUDENTS. ARE

STARTING TO GET IN PERSON

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:21.911
ENGAGEMENT IMMEDIATELY AND THEN

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:23.646
WE WOULD NOT REQUIRE FULL

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:25.815
GRADES UNTIL THE RED TIER

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:27.417
HOWEVER UNDER CURRENT PUBLIC

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:28.785
HEALTH GUIDANCE THEY'RE

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:31.854
ABSOLUTELY ALLOWED TO OPEN AND-

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:32.855
IT WOULD STILL BE A LOCAL

01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:37.427
CONTROL CONTROL DECISION ABOUT.

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:37.994
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:38.594
RECONSIDER. WHAT THEY HAVE ARE

01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:39.829
DECIDED TO DO WE ASSUME THAT

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:41.330
THE PRESSURE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:42.198
WOULD MAKE THAT SOMETHING THAT

01:01:42.265 --> 01:01:43.966
WOULD NOT HAPPEN. SO GETTING TO

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.968
THE VACCINES QUESTION IF YOU

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:49.005
LOOK AT SECTION FOUR THREE FIVE

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:49.639
TWO SIX BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A

01:01:49.705 --> 01:01:50.506
LOT OF CONFUSION IN THE MEDIA

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:52.041
ABOUT WHAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:53.810
BILL ACTUALLY SAYS. THERE IS NO

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:56.279
REFERENCE IN THE BUILD TO

01:01:56.345 --> 01:01:57.580
VACCINES AND THE SCHOOLS ARE

01:01:57.647 --> 01:01:58.881
RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOCAL

01:01:58.948 --> 01:02:00.450
EDUCATION AGENCIES IT IS

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:02.485
SPECIFICALLY A MANDATE. THAT

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:03.586
COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH

01:02:03.653 --> 01:02:05.555
DEPARTMENTS THE BIG PUBLIC

01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:07.023
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MAKE THE

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.191
COVERT NINETEEN VACCINE

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:10.059
AVAILABLE TO SCHOOL SITE

01:02:10.126 --> 01:02:11.260
PERSONNEL WHO WERE WORKING AT A

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:12.595
SCHOOL SITE WHERE STUDENTS ARE

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:14.597
ATTENDING IN PERSON. AND THE

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:15.631
REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THAT

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:17.667
WHILE TEACHERS ARE ELIGIBLE

01:02:17.733 --> 01:02:19.202
CHILD CARE WORKERS ARE ELIGIBLE

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:21.571
UNDER ONE B. WE HAVE DATA BACK

01:02:21.637 --> 01:02:22.305
FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:23.806
STATE. BOARD OF EDUCATION THAT

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:25.775
SHOWS THAT MANY MANY COUNTIES

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:27.276
INCLUDING OUR LARGEST URBAN

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:29.645
COUNTIES. ARE NOT YET MAKING

THOUGH IT IS ALLOWABLE UNDER

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:35.084
ONE B. SO THIS BILL WOULD TAKE

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:37.186
THAT STEP TO REQUIRE LOCAL

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:39.322
PUBLIC HEALTH. TO MAKE SURE

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:40.623
THOSE VACCINES ARE AVAILABLE

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.358
FOR ALL SCHOOL PERSONNEL. WHO

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:43.793
ARE GOING TO BE INSTRUCTING IN

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.161
PERSON AND WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE

01:02:45.228 --> 01:02:47.296
THAT THIS WILL BE A CATALYST.

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:48.798
FOR CONFIDENCE AMONGST OUR

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.733
WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO RETURN TO

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.034
CAMPUS BUT IT IS NOT A

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:54.403
REQUIREMENT. MORE PRESSURE ON

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:56.005
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ITSELF.

01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:58.841
SURVISCOR FOLLOW UP AND- IF A

01:02:58.908 --> 01:03:01.644
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH. OFFICE

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:03.179
CANNOT MAKE VACCINES AVAILABLE

01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:06.916
BECAUSE OF JUST. STATE SUPPLY-

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:07.517
SOMETHING THAT'S OUTSIDE THEIR

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:09.585
CONTROL WHAT RESTRICTIONS AND

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:13.456
WOULD BE PLACED. ON THE SCHOOL

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:14.190
DISTRICT. THIS IT DOES NOT

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:14.757
PLACE ANY RESTRICTIONS THE

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:15.958
SCHOOL DISTRICT THE LANGUAGE IS

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:18.895
NOT A- A REQUIREMENT FOR RETURN

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.696
TO WORK- REQUIREMENT FOR THEIR

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:22.598
PLAN. THERE IS NO WHERE IN THE

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:24.200
BILL WHERE THERE IS AN

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:25.568
INTERSECTION BETWEEN VACCINES

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:26.802
AND IT IS SCHOOL DISTRICT'S

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:29.972
RESPONSIBILITY- HOWEVER WE ARE

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:31.474

INTERESTING CREATING A SET

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:40.616
ASIDE SPECIFICALLY FOR SCHOOL

SITE PERSONNEL THAT WE BELIEVE

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:43.119

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:44.987
SIX. WE ARE DISSIPATING BUT

OVER THE MONTHS OF MARCH AND

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:47.623
APRIL THAT THERE WILL BE A

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:49.125
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN VACCINE

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:51.027
AVAILABILITY. FOR THESE

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:53.095
TARGETED GROUPS. SUGGEST THE

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:54.830
REQUIRED THIS BILL DOES NOT

01:03:54.897 --> 01:03:56.866
HAVE A VACCINE REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:03:56.933 --> 01:03:59.669
SCHOOLS EXPERT DISTRICTS TO

REOPEN CORRECT. OKAY SAID

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:03.105
JESSICA NOT TO PUT YOU ON THE

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:04.440
SPOT BUT I AM IMPROPER PURPOSE

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.576
PUTTING ON THE SPOT DO YOU.

01:04:06.642 --> 01:04:07.176
AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT IN

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:10.746
THIS BILL. YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:13.149
THAT QUESTION I THINK THAT

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:14.350
THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF-

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:16.385
AMBIGUITY IN THE LANGUAGE AS IT

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:18.221
CURRENTLY IS WRITTEN. AND IT

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:19.422
CAN BE INTERPRETED DIFFERENT

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:20.856
WAYS AND SO WE ARE CERTAINLY

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.158
CONCERNED WITH THE LANGUAGE AT

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:23.059
THE THREATEN WE ALSO

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:24.694
QUESTIONED. THE NEED FOR THE

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.796
LANGUAGE GIVEN- THAT NOW THAT

01:04:26.862 --> 01:04:29.465
THE GOVERNOR MADE- REGARDING

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.234
THE FACT THAT WE ARE. GOING TO

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.935
ENSURE THROUGH OUR THIRD PARTY

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:34.604
AGREEMENT AT EVERY SINGLE

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:36.072
COUNTY IN THE STATE IS GOING TO

01:04:36.138 --> 01:04:38.174
BE PRIORITIZING EDUCATORS.

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:40.409
EQUALLY WITHIN THAT TIER ONE B.

01:04:40.476 --> 01:04:42.778
CATEGORY AS WELL AS THE 10%

01:04:42.845 --> 01:04:44.747
SATISFIED OR VACCINATIONS FOR

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:45.648
EDUCATORS WHICH WE WOULD JUST

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:48.117
NOTED NOT- SOMETHING THAT WE

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:49.385
ARE PROPOSING FOR ANY OTHER

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:51.654
SECTOR IN THE STATE- SO IT

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:52.421
DEFINITELY PRIORITIZING

01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:55.591
TEACHERS- SO I DON'T THINK THAT

01:04:55.658 --> 01:04:56.459
WE FEEL LIKE THAT LANGUAGE IS

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:57.927
NECESSARY AND CERTAINLY GIVEN

01:04:57.994 --> 01:04:58.828
THE WAY THAT IT'S CURRENTLY

01:04:58.894 --> 01:05:00.296
CRAFTING. PROVIDES A LOT OF

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:02.398
CONFUSION TO THE FIELD- ONE

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:03.532
OTHER THING THAT I WOULD JUST

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:04.667
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I KNOW

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:05.601
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:06.769
MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT YOU

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:08.004
KNOW WHAT IT WORDS CURRENT LAW

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:10.473
ON VACCINATION. AND CURRENT LAW

01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:12.141
DOES NOT REQUIRE VACCINATION

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:13.042
FOR EDUCATORS TO GO BACK INTO

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:15.144
THE CLASSROOM AND- ON THE

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:16.712
RECENTLY REALLY FEDERAL CDC

01:05:16.779 --> 01:05:18.147
GUIDANCE OFFICE THE COURT THAT

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:19.248
THAT MOTHER ACTIVATION

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:22.051
CERTAINLY- IS ONE PIECE AS-

01:05:22.118 --> 01:05:24.453
WHAT CAN BE A YOU KNOW AS- A

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.088
MODEL FOR BRINGING. AND

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:26.922
TEACHERS ACK INTO THE

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:28.624
CLASSROOM. REALLY THE MOST

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:31.060
IMPORTANT PIECES OF MEDICATING

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:32.495
COATED FRED ARE THE OTHER

01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:34.230
HEALTH AND SAFETY FACTORS

01:05:34.297 --> 01:05:34.697
AROUND MASKING SOCIAL

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:37.366
DISTANCING- CLEANING. AND WE

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:39.702
CERTAINLY FEEL LIKE THOSE ARE-

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.771
REALLY WELL DESCRIBED AND LAID

01:05:41.837 --> 01:05:48.711
OUT IN OUR STATEWIDE GUIDANCE.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:49.278
FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL IN PERSON

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:50.046
INSTRUCTION. OKAY SO I JUST SAY

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:52.214
THAT THE- THE CONCERN THAT I IS.

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:53.416
THAT THERE NEEDS TO FEED AND

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:56.052
GRAPHIC. ON THIS- AND THE US

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:58.654
AREA THAT THAT CLEARLY EXISTS

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:02.158
AND TALKING TO BOTH OF YOU- AT

01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:04.694
ON BOTH SIDES. THAT YOU KNOW WE

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.228
CERTAINLY WANT TO ENSURE THAT

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:08.664
DISTRICTS. HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:10.232
TO REOPEN WE CERTAINLY WANT

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:12.101
TEACHERS AND STAFF VACCINATED.

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:14.203
THOUGH COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.038
OFFICERS ARE AT THE WHIM OF.

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:18.474

CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER THE-

01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:21.844
CERTAINLY ALL OTHER SAFETY

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:23.346
MECHANISMS THAT ARE IN PLACE

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:25.348
OAK TESTING AND- PP AND

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:26.749
SANITATION TO ENSURE THAT THERE

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:29.185

TO ENSURE SCHOOLS ARE REOPENED

01:06:30.386 --> 01:06:32.021

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:33.055
THAT DISTRICTS HAVE THE

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:35.124
FLEXIBILITY TO SELL. AND THAT

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:37.660
WE MAINTAIN A PATH. FOR SCHOOL

SOME OF THE POINTS I REPRESENT

01:19:57.592 --> 01:19:58.660
ELEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND I%

01:19:58.727 --> 01:20:01.229
AM AND THEY L. A. COUNTY- KIND

01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:03.965

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.739
REQUIREMENTS WHAT HAPPENS IF

01:20:10.805 --> 01:20:13.008
THOSE DISTRICTS DON'T COME INTO

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:15.143
AN AGREEMENT- ARE THEY STILL

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:18.713
REQUIRED TO. WHAT'S GOING TO

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:19.614
HAPPEN IF THERE IS NO AGREEMENT.

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:21.917
YES THIS IS BEEN A COMMON-

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:23.084
POINT OF CONFUSION WE'VE HEARD

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:24.286
OVER THE WEEKEND FROM SCHOOL

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:26.521

THIS BILL- OUT THAT'S ABOVE AND

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:44.606
BEYOND EXISTING LABOR LAWS THAT

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:47.375
WOULD- ALLOW BARGAINING UNITS

01:20:47.442 --> 01:20:48.577
TO BE WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:49.778

IF AN ALLEY A FOR WHATEVER

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:52.741
REASON CONTINUES TO BELIEVE

ANSWERS NOW I CANNOT CORRECT

01:22:04.119 --> 01:22:04.953
THIS IS AN INCENTIVE NOT A

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.555
MANDATE OKAY. AND THEN- ALSO IN

01:22:07.622 --> 01:22:10.792
TERMS OF THE VACCINATIONS- WERE

01:22:10.859 --> 01:22:12.260
VACCINE WHERE THE GOAL IS TO

WORKFORCE CORRECT- BUT- HOW ARE

01:22:18.366 --> 01:22:19.434
WE TRACKING ARE WE GOING TO

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:20.869
PRIORITIZE THOSE DISTRICTS THEY

WILL BE RE OPENING. OBVERSES

01:22:23.305 --> 01:22:25.206
THOSE THAT THAT WON'T BECAUSE-

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:27.742
IF WE'RE IF WE HAVE A MINIMUM-

01:22:27.809 --> 01:22:30.312
AMOUNT OF VACCINES. AND SOME

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:31.780
DISTRICTS ARE NOT GOING TO OPEN

01:22:31.846 --> 01:22:33.148
A WE'RE GOING TO BE VACCINATING

01:22:33.214 --> 01:22:34.616
THAT GROUP VERSUS THE ONE THAT

01:22:34.683 --> 01:22:36.484
ARE RE OPENING- BASED ON THE

01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:38.253
GUIDELINES. YES THANK YOU THAT

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.587
THAT IS EXACTLY WHY THE

01:22:39.654 --> 01:22:41.056
LANGUAGE IT SAYS SPECIFICALLY

01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:42.824
IT'S FOR A PERSONALITY- ARE

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:45.026
PROVIDING IN PERSON SERVICES.

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:46.127
BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT THERE

01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:47.929
IS A VERY WIDE RANGE OF

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:49.631
PERSONNEL- COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:51.666
PROFESSORS- FOLKS IN HIGH

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:53.468
SCHOOL THAT ARE I'M NOT

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:54.703
PLANNING TO BE OPEN BECAUSE OF

01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:56.037
COMMUNITY SPREAD AND THERE ARE

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:58.206
ELIGIBLE UNDER ONE B. SO THIS

01:22:58.273 --> 01:23:00.275
IS SPECIFICALLY. SAYING THEY

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:01.443
ARE PROVIDING IN PERSON

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:02.944
SERVICESIN ORDER TO HAVE THIS

01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:05.513
EXPDITED- AVAILABILITY TO THE

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:06.715
FRONT LINE SO YOU WILL BE

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:08.149
TRACKING ON THOSE THOSE

01:23:08.216 --> 01:23:09.017
DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO

01:23:09.084 --> 01:23:11.052
BASICALLY PUT IN A REQUEST- TO

01:23:11.119 --> 01:23:12.287

CAN YOU VACCINATE ALL OVER

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:15.423
EDUCATION WORKFORCE. SO THE

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:16.925
BILL DOES NOT PUT ANY KIND OF

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:18.493
REQUIREMENTS OF US SCHOOL

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.594
DISTRICTS TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:20.762
ROLE THAT WE KNOW SO MANY OF

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:21.963
THEM HAVE BEEN AND HAVE BEEN

01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.931
TRYING TO WORK WITH THE COUNTY

01:23:22.997 --> 01:23:23.998
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:25.934
ORDER TO LEVERAGE VACCINATION

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.001
DAYS OF APPOINTMENTS FOR THEIR

01:23:27.068 --> 01:23:28.470
STAFF. THERE'S NOTHING IN THE

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:29.637
BILL THAT REQUIRES THEM TO DO

01:23:29.704 --> 01:23:33.441
THAT- BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY

01:23:33.508 --> 01:23:34.075
SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD WHAT

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:35.043
O. WITH DOES IS IT RICK. THAT

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:37.479
COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH. OFFICER

01:23:37.545 --> 01:23:39.481
TO BE A PARTNER AT THE TABLE

01:23:39.547 --> 01:23:41.216
MAKING THOSE VACCINES AVAILABLE

01:23:41.282 --> 01:23:44.419
FOR INDIVIDUAL PERSONAL. OKAY

01:23:44.486 --> 01:23:45.954
THANK YOU AND THEN THE OTHER ON

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:51.059
THE QUESTION- IS. THE SO I

01:23:51.126 --> 01:23:52.694
GUESS IT'S THE SAME KIND OF

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:54.763
QUESTION. THERE IS CONFUSION AS

01:23:54.829 --> 01:23:56.931
WHO HAS TO ARE WE OPEN BY APRIL

01:23:56.998 --> 01:23:58.933
FIFTEENTH I HAVE AN EMAIL FROM

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.269
MY KIDS SCHOOL THAT K. TWELVE

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:02.871
R. K. SIX IS OPENING THIS WEEK

01:24:02.937 --> 01:24:04.139
AND THE MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:06.274
SCHOOL KIDS- WON'T OPEN UNTIL

01:24:06.341 --> 01:24:08.209
AT LEAST APRIL FIFTEENTH. IS

01:24:08.276 --> 01:24:10.044
THAT A SET STANDARD OR IS IT

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:12.113
DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT AREAS-

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.015
HOW DOES THAT WORK YES SO THIS

01:24:14.082 --> 01:24:15.650
THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE ANY

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:16.751
OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE

01:24:16.818 --> 01:24:17.952
THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY

01:24:18.019 --> 01:24:18.987
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

01:24:19.053 --> 01:24:20.355
SO THE GUIDANCE THAT THEY

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:22.223
PUBLISH THAT WAS VERY CLEAR IS

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:24.526
A MINIMUM FLOOR FOR SAFETY. IN

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:27.095
JANUARY- THAT YOU'RE REFERRING

01:24:27.162 --> 01:24:28.730
TO IT AT ALL TIMES IN HERE BUT

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:31.232
NOT MAKING ANY CHANGES SO THE

01:24:31.299 --> 01:24:31.933
CONDITION FACT WHAT THE BILL

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.469
SAYS IS THAT SCHOOLS ARE

01:24:34.536 --> 01:24:36.171
ALLOWED TO OPEN UNDER PUBLIC

01:24:36.237 --> 01:24:37.972
HEALTH GUIDANCE YOUR REGARDLESS

01:24:38.039 --> 01:24:40.074
OF THIS BILL SO IF THEY ARE

01:24:40.141 --> 01:24:41.609
TAKING THE INCENTIVE FUNDING

01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:43.011
NOT TAKING INCENTIVE FUNDING

01:24:43.077 --> 01:24:44.312
THEY STILL NEED TO FOLLOW

01:24:44.379 --> 01:24:45.814
PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES. OKAY

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.716
AND THEN- MY CONCERN IS THE

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:50.852
LANGUAGE SAYS SHALL YOU KNOW

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.220
EVERYTHING'S AS SHALLOW AS

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:53.555
OPPOSED TO WELL AND THAT'S

01:24:53.621 --> 01:24:55.690
WHERE THE CONFUSION IS AND SO I

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:57.592
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE EITHER WE

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:58.793
CAN CLEAR UP THE LANGUAGE OR IF

01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:00.762
I CAN ASK- JESSICA WHAT THEIR

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:03.231
INTERPRETATION IS ON BASED ON

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:05.700
BOTH BOTH TERMS SHALL. WHATEVER

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:08.670
THE NEXT STOP THE SENTENCES BY

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:10.004

THAT I'M SEEING HAS THE WORD

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:44.372
SHALL AND- YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S

01:25:44.439 --> 01:25:45.707
BASED ON INTERPRETATIONS OF

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:48.209
SOME. DISTRICTS WILL NOT COMPLY

01:25:48.276 --> 01:25:50.445
BECAUSE OF THE WORD SHALL OR-

POINT- YOU KNOW UP AND RUNNING.

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:04.659
SO- EIGHT DAYS OUR TRADITION OF

NEGOTIATION TO OPEN OUR

TEACHER SAFETY AND- NOT JUST

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:03.785

THEIR SAFETY AND WE SHOULD

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:07.889
PRIORITIZE- VACCINES FOR THEM

01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:10.024
ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES. THAT

FOR IN PERSON LEARNING. WITH

01:33:30.037 --> 01:33:31.706
EVERY VISIT THE TESTING CADENCE

01:33:31.772 --> 01:33:34.875
BECAUSE IT IS. AN IMPORTANT FOR

01:33:34.942 --> 01:33:36.877
MY DISTRICT ARE IN MY DISTRICT

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:38.946
I HAVE SOME SCHOOLS THAT HAVE

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:40.247
BEEN OPERATING UNDER WAIVERS

01:33:40.314 --> 01:33:42.917
SINCE FALL SOME SCHOOLS WHO

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:44.452
WERE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE-

01:33:44.518 --> 01:33:47.054
THEY'RE APPROVED WAIVERS- WHICH

01:33:47.121 --> 01:33:48.956
THEY DIDN'T ACTIVATE BECAUSE OF

01:33:49.023 --> 01:33:51.459
THE SURGE. OR THEN PULLED-

01:33:51.525 --> 01:33:54.328
BECAUSE OF THE JANUARY JANUARY

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:55.930
TWENTY EIGHTH OR TWENTY FOURTH-

01:33:55.997 --> 01:33:57.598
GUIDELINE CHANGES SO THERE'S

01:33:57.665 --> 01:33:59.000
ALREADY FRUSTRATION WHAT I

01:33:59.066 --> 01:34:00.267
WOULD DON'T WANT TO HAPPEN IS

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:01.669
FOR OUR SCHOOLS THAT ARE

01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:03.504
ALREADY OPEN. TO RUN INTO

01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:05.539
PROBLEMS AGAIN- THAT ARE GOING

01:34:05.606 --> 01:34:08.242
TO CREATE MORE COMPLICATIONS

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:11.145
FOR THEM PART OF- WHAT MY

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:14.615
QUESTION IS AROUND IS A TESTING

01:34:14.682 --> 01:34:15.182
KIT AND CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN

01:34:15.249 --> 01:34:17.685
AGAIN. WHAT SCHOOLS HAVE TO

01:34:17.752 --> 01:34:20.554
ADOPT. HAVE TO UTILIZE THE

01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:26.994
TESTING. CADENCE REGIMENT. YES

01:34:27.061 --> 01:34:28.396
OF THE WEAPONS OF THE- THE

01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:31.032
TESTING CADENCES THAT ARE PART

01:34:31.098 --> 01:34:33.100
OF THE CDPH GUIDELINES WOULD BE

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:34.935
REQUIRED FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:36.037
THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY ALREADY

01:34:36.103 --> 01:34:38.606
HAVE AN ADOPTED PLAN TO RE OPEN

01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:40.174
SO THE GRANDFATHERING CLAUSE

01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:42.309
THAT I REFERRED TO EARLIER IS

01:34:42.376 --> 01:34:44.812
INTENDED TO AND LEGALLY WOULD

01:34:44.879 --> 01:34:46.213
PROTECT A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.582
ALREADY HAS AN ADOPTED PLAN

01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:49.350
EVEN IF THEY HAVE NOT YET BEEN

01:34:49.417 --> 01:34:50.551
ABLE TO IMPLEMENT BECAUSE OF

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:53.387
THE TEAR THAT THEY ARE IN AND

01:34:53.454 --> 01:34:54.588
IT WAS UNSAFE TO OPEN. SO THIS

01:34:54.655 --> 01:34:57.224
FUND IS. A LOT MORE COMPLICATED

01:34:57.291 --> 01:34:59.293
ESPECIALLY FOR OUR SEVEN

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:02.096
THROUGH TWELVE. SCHOOLS UN IS

01:35:02.163 --> 01:35:04.331
THERE A AND ON TOP OF THE

01:35:04.398 --> 01:35:08.536
TEARS- SO FOR HIGH SCHOOLS ARE

01:35:08.602 --> 01:35:09.603
SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE UNLIKE

01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:11.539
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WHEN TEARS.

01:35:11.605 --> 01:35:13.541
WHEN CASES GET TO TWENTY FIVE

01:35:13.607 --> 01:35:15.209
PER ONE HUNDRED. THEY CAN THEY

01:35:15.276 --> 01:35:17.678
CAN OPEN NOW FOR HIGH SCHOOLS

01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:20.681
AT SEVEN. PER ONE HUNDRED- I

01:35:20.748 --> 01:35:22.216
THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A SERIOUS

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:25.086
LOOK AT THIS. OUR HIGH SCHOOL

01:35:25.152 --> 01:35:25.586
STUDENTS ARE COMMITTING

01:35:25.653 --> 01:35:27.721
SUICIDE. AND I THINK IT'S

01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:28.923
SOMETHING THAT WE SERIOUSLY

01:35:28.989 --> 01:35:30.691
NEED TO CONSIDER IS MAKING IT

01:35:30.758 --> 01:35:33.627
EASIER. AND LESS COMPLICATED

01:35:33.694 --> 01:35:35.096
FOR OUR HIGH SCHOOLS AND JUNIOR

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:38.833
HIGHS TO OPEN AS WELL. MY NEXT

01:35:38.899 --> 01:35:42.803
QUESTION IS- IS THERE IN THE

01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:44.738
LANGUAGE THAT EXIST FOR IN

01:35:44.805 --> 01:35:46.607
PERSON LEARNING WHAT DOES IN

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:48.676
PERSON LEARNING MEAN IS THERE A

01:35:48.742 --> 01:35:50.478
MINIMUM DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU

01:35:50.544 --> 01:35:52.513
KNOW A SCHOOL COULD ONLY BE YOU

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.548
KNOW IT HAVE IN PERSON LEARNING

01:35:54.615 --> 01:35:57.485
AN HOUR A WEEK OR IT'S KIND OF

01:35:57.551 --> 01:35:58.319
I DON'T SEE ANY CLEARLY ENOUGH

01:35:58.385 --> 01:36:00.454
WHAT THAT MEANS. YES THERE ARE-

01:36:00.521 --> 01:36:03.257
DEFINITIONS IN THE CURRENT LAW

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:05.793
THAT ARE NOT CHANGED IN SB

01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:06.327
EIGHTY SIX RUN THE MINIMUM

01:36:06.393 --> 01:36:07.895
NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES

01:36:07.962 --> 01:36:10.397
THAT NEED TO BE PROVIDED DURING

01:36:10.464 --> 01:36:12.233
THIS SCHOOL YEAR SO WE DID

01:36:12.299 --> 01:36:13.234
CHANGE THAT IS PART OF THE

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.336
DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL SO

01:36:15.402 --> 01:36:16.337
THOSE MINUTES IF NOT YET

01:36:16.403 --> 01:36:18.139
CHANGED WHAT WE DO HERE IS TO

01:36:18.205 --> 01:36:19.940
FIND IN PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR

01:36:20.007 --> 01:36:22.510
TKA THROUGH SIX IS BEING UNDER

01:36:22.576 --> 01:36:23.777
THE IMMEDIATE PHYSICAL

01:36:23.844 --> 01:36:25.646
SUPERVISION OF A CERTIFICATED

01:36:25.713 --> 01:36:28.349
EMPLOYEE AND THEN FOR- OLDER

01:36:28.415 --> 01:36:30.151
GRADES FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL AND

01:36:30.217 --> 01:36:32.620
FOR HIGH SCHOOL IN THE-

01:36:32.686 --> 01:36:35.789
PHYSICAL AND- AS SPACE OF EIGHT

01:36:35.856 --> 01:36:37.224
EITHER A CERTIFICATED OR

01:36:37.291 --> 01:36:40.027
CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE. TO ALLOW-

01:36:40.094 --> 01:36:41.262
FOR SAFER CONCORD TAKING OF

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:42.997
THOSE OLDER GRADES WHILE

01:36:43.063 --> 01:36:44.131
KNOWING THEY HAVE MULTIPLE

01:36:44.198 --> 01:36:45.266
TEACHERS SO KNOWING THAT THEY

01:36:45.332 --> 01:36:46.433
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE IN THE

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:50.604
PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF IT OF EACH

01:36:50.671 --> 01:36:51.172
OF THEIR TEACHERS THROUGHOUT

01:36:51.238 --> 01:36:54.275
THE DAY. AND THE REQUIREMENT

01:36:54.341 --> 01:36:56.443
THAT 10% OF EXPANDED LEARNING

01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:58.646
TIME GRANT FUNDS TO BE SPENT ON

01:36:58.712 --> 01:37:00.548
PARA PROFESSIONAL STAFF. MY

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:01.849
DISTRICTS ARE CONCERNED THAT IT

01:37:01.916 --> 01:37:03.184
COULD CREATE ARBITRARY AND

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:05.886
UNNECESSARY ONGOING FISCAL

01:37:05.953 --> 01:37:09.823
OBLIGATIONS ON WHY NOT GIVE

01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:10.357
DISTRICTS MORE FLEXIBILITY

01:37:10.424 --> 01:37:12.860
WITHOUT SPENDING. SO THE I'M

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:14.862
INTENT IN SB EIGHTY SIX IS TO

01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:15.896
ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN

01:37:15.963 --> 01:37:18.832
EMPHASIS ON- THE ADULTS TO

01:37:18.899 --> 01:37:19.833
STUDENT RATIOS THAT ARE

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:21.702
NECESSARY NOT JUST FOR PUBLIC

01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:23.437
HEALTH PURPOSES- UNDER THE

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:25.139
PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE BUT ALSO

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:26.707
TO TRULY ADDRESS LEARNING LOSS

01:37:26.774 --> 01:37:27.808
AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A LOT

01:37:27.875 --> 01:37:30.811
OF THE- CALL OUTS AND AROUND TO

01:37:30.878 --> 01:37:31.812
BRING. IN ONE ON ONE

01:37:31.879 --> 01:37:33.280
INTERVENTIONS AND OTHER KINDS

01:37:33.347 --> 01:37:35.683
OF SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORTS. THE

01:37:35.749 --> 01:37:36.617
UNDERSTANDING IS THE

01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:37.885
SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORTS MEAN

01:37:37.952 --> 01:37:40.187
SUPPLEMENTAL PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:37:40.254 --> 01:37:42.056
UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORTS

01:37:42.122 --> 01:37:44.992
SO- WE ACTUALLY ANTICIPATE A

01:37:45.059 --> 01:37:46.427
LARGE MAJORITY OF THE LEARNING

01:37:46.493 --> 01:37:49.129
RECOVERY FUNDS BEING UTILIZED

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:50.798
FOR CERTIFICATED AND CLASSIFIED

01:37:50.864 --> 01:37:53.500
EMPLOYEES- THERE WAS A GREAT

01:37:53.567 --> 01:37:55.102
NUMBER OF LAYOFFS THAT HAPPENED

01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:56.971
IN THE SPRING FOR A PAIR

01:37:57.037 --> 01:37:58.172
PROFESSIONALS IN PARTICULAR

01:37:58.239 --> 01:37:59.873
THOSE WHO PROVIDE. ONE ON ONE

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:01.208
SUPPORT FOR SPECIAL NEEDS

01:38:01.275 --> 01:38:02.676
STUDENTS AND SO WE DO

01:38:02.743 --> 01:38:04.545
ANTICIPATE MANY MANY ELEAZAR

01:38:04.612 --> 01:38:06.513
BRINGING BACK THAT STAFFING

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:08.315
CAPACITY IN THIS NEXT YEAR IF

SCHOOL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS

01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:47.121
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A ONE THE

01:38:47.187 --> 01:38:49.156
HIGH COST OF TESTING. AND

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:52.526

EXPERT BUT I BELIEVE I CAN

01:39:43.177 --> 01:39:46.480
PROVIDE SOME. THEN- INFORMATION

01:39:46.547 --> 01:39:47.381

01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:48.282
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THIS LOOKS

01:39:48.349 --> 01:39:50.184
LIKE AND THE ANSWER IS REALLY

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:51.151
DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF TESTING

01:39:51.218 --> 01:39:53.554
THAT- DIFFICULT DISTRICT AND

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:56.090
HAD ALL PROCURED OR AT THEIR AT

01:39:56.156 --> 01:39:58.392
THEIR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS-

01:39:58.459 --> 01:39:59.660
THEY'RE DIFFERENT KIND OF PASS.

01:39:59.727 --> 01:40:01.328
AND SOME OF THEM I THINK THE

01:40:01.395 --> 01:40:02.629
MAJORITY OF THE ONES THAT I'VE

01:40:02.696 --> 01:40:04.264

CASES AND IF IT'S BEING DONE ON

01:40:30.157 --> 01:40:31.859
CAMPUS THE STUDENT WORKS BUT

01:40:31.925 --> 01:40:33.527
PUT THE THOUGHT IN THEIR NOSE.

01:40:33.594 --> 01:40:37.798

01:40:48.208 --> 01:40:51.111
PRETTY- POPULAR OPTION AND THAT

01:40:51.178 --> 01:40:52.613
MANY FOLKS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE

01:40:52.679 --> 01:40:55.115
OF. IT AT HOME TESTING WHERE

01:40:55.182 --> 01:40:57.050
FAMILIES AND TEACHERS AND

01:40:57.117 --> 01:40:58.152
ANYONE WHO'S BEEN TAPPED ON THE

01:40:58.218 --> 01:41:00.754
CAMPUS JUST GET ON AS A SORT OF

01:41:00.821 --> 01:41:03.323
PATH THAT IS. SPECIFIC FOR THEN

01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:04.258
THEY TAKE IT HOME THEY CAN DO

01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:05.526
THE TASK AND THEN DROP IT OFF

01:41:05.592 --> 01:41:07.060
WHEN THEY COME TO SCHOOL AND

01:41:07.127 --> 01:41:08.028
THEN WILL PRESIDENT

01:41:08.095 --> 01:41:10.297
COLLABORATORY FOR TESTING- BUT

01:41:10.364 --> 01:41:11.698
THAT LIKE I SAID THERE ARE MANY

01:41:11.765 --> 01:41:13.000
DIFFERENT KINDS OF TASK- IT

01:41:13.066 --> 01:41:14.935
REALLY DEPENDS ON. WHO THE

01:41:15.002 --> 01:41:16.937
SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS CONTRACTED

01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:19.940
WITH FOR THE TESTING- AND YOU

01:41:20.007 --> 01:41:20.741

01:41:20.808 --> 01:41:23.076
METHOD FOR WHAT THEY HAVE AND

01:41:23.143 --> 01:41:24.745
WHAT THEY HAVE AGREED TO AND

01:41:24.812 --> 01:41:26.680
WITH THEIR LABOR PARTNERS. TALK

01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:27.848
ABOUT GIVES YOU A SENSE SOME

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:28.882
SENSE OF WHAT THAT COULD LOOK

01:41:28.949 --> 01:41:29.917
LIKE BUT AGAIN IT'S A LITTLE

01:41:29.983 --> 01:41:31.485
BIT DIFFERENT ACROSS THE STATE.

01:41:31.552 --> 01:41:43.363
I WOULD JUST SAY. AGAIN AS A

01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.997
CLASSROOM TEACHER. THE SOUNDS

01:41:44.064 --> 01:41:45.165
GOOD BUT IN REALITY THAT'S

01:41:45.232 --> 01:41:46.834
SOMETHING ELSE AT THAT CAN.

01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:47.868
FIRST GRADE TO ADMINISTER THIS

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:49.770
TEST- I THEIR OWN I IS SORT-

01:41:49.837 --> 01:41:51.772

01:41:54.007 --> 01:41:56.577
TESTING THEN WE SOMETHING THAT

01:41:56.643 --> 01:42:01.014
WOULD BE REQUIRED WEEKLY.

01:42:01.081 --> 01:42:03.450
PURSUANT TO THE CURRENT STATE

01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:06.053

PROPOSAL FOR RE OPENING AND

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:11.625
DOES THE TESTING WOULD BE

01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:13.827
REQUIRED WEEKLY FOR- FOR

01:42:13.894 --> 01:42:15.195
SCHOOLS THAT ARE OPEN IN THE

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:16.530
PURPLE CURES THAT WOULD BE THE

01:42:16.597 --> 01:42:20.501
HIGHEST HERE- THE INFECTION

01:42:20.567 --> 01:42:23.837
RATE. AND IF THE SCHOOL DID

01:42:23.904 --> 01:42:24.438
CHOOSE TO DO IT AT THE SCHOOL

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:28.442
SITE. WOULD THAT BE THE TEACHER

01:42:28.509 --> 01:42:29.443
WHO WOULD THEN BE COLLECTING

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:34.848
THESE TESTS FROM STUDENTS. I DO

01:42:34.915 --> 01:42:38.051
KNOW THAT THERE ARE AND IF IT'S

01:42:38.118 --> 01:42:39.386
NOT ON THE COOL SIDE SO FOR

01:42:39.453 --> 01:42:41.989
EXAMPLE IF IT'S AT HOME- AS YOU

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:43.290
COULD BE SOMEONE IN THE FRONT

01:42:43.357 --> 01:42:45.392

OFFS THAT THEY'VE DONE AT HOME

01:42:48.028 --> 01:42:49.496
AFTER THAT THERE ARE SOME LOCAL

01:50:45.038 --> 01:50:47.273
MANY ROLES THAT ARE. TEACHERS

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:48.508
PLAY I WAS A MATH TEACHER FOR

01:50:48.575 --> 01:50:49.576
THIRTEEN YEARS AND MY JOB IS

01:50:49.642 --> 01:50:50.810
NOT JUST TO TEACH A CORE DATA

01:50:50.877 --> 01:50:52.979
FORMULA OR NUMBERS. A SPACE A

01:50:53.046 --> 01:50:56.416
LITTLE BUT PROVIDE A WHOLE-

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:57.917
SUITE OF SUPPORT FOR OUSTED AND

01:50:57.984 --> 01:50:59.919
FAMILIES OUT THERE WE'VE ASKED.

01:50:59.986 --> 01:51:02.722
ARE IN. MAKE ADJUST AND HAVE.

01:51:02.789 --> 01:51:05.625
TO ADJUST TO- VIRTUAL LEARNING

01:51:05.692 --> 01:51:07.127
AND THEY HAVE TO ADJUST TO A

01:51:07.193 --> 01:51:08.728
BLENDED SYSTEM AND THEY HAVE.

01:51:08.795 --> 01:51:10.830
WE'RE ASKING THEM NOW TO RETURN

01:51:10.897 --> 01:51:12.265
TO THE CLASSROOM AND AS A

01:51:12.332 --> 01:51:14.300
TEACHER AND ALL MY FRIENDS ARE

01:51:14.367 --> 01:51:15.035
TEACHERS THEY'RE READY TO GO

01:51:15.101 --> 01:51:15.969
BACK TO THE CLASSROOM THEY KNOW

01:51:16.036 --> 01:51:17.570
THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT. BUT

01:51:17.637 --> 01:51:18.471
THEY ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:51:18.538 --> 01:51:19.439
THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED AND THEN

01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:20.507
I BRING SOMETHING HOME TO THEIR

01:51:20.573 --> 01:51:22.475
FAMILIES ALONG THE WAY. AND SO

01:51:22.542 --> 01:51:23.676
AS WE MOVE BACK THINGS UP AND

01:51:23.743 --> 01:51:25.145
MOVE THEM TO THE LIST I ON MAKE

01:51:25.211 --> 01:51:26.946
SURE THAT IT'S EQUITABLE. I

01:51:27.013 --> 01:51:27.914
HAVE FRIENDS WHO TEACH IN SOME

01:51:27.981 --> 01:51:30.250
OF THE HARD HIT COMMUNITIES- MY

01:51:30.316 --> 01:51:31.317
COLLEAGUES IN THE SAN FERNANDO

01:51:31.384 --> 01:51:33.453
VALLEY AND MY COMMUNITY I FEEL

01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:35.789
OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR SISTERS

01:51:35.855 --> 01:51:36.523
AND BROTHERS AND THINGS

01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:37.857
STRUGGLE OUT THERE EVEN THOUGH

01:51:37.924 --> 01:51:38.491
WE'RE SEPARATED BY MANY

01:51:38.558 --> 01:51:40.794
FREEWAYS. ALONG THE WAY BUT WE

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:42.028
ALSO HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST

01:51:42.095 --> 01:51:43.263
RATES OF INFECTIONS OF DEBTS

01:51:43.329 --> 01:51:44.297
THAT SOME OF THE LOWEST RATES

01:51:44.364 --> 01:51:46.266
OF VACCINATION IN MY HOME TOWN.

01:51:46.332 --> 01:51:48.301
WHAT ABOUT 7% THAT'S NATION

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:50.070
RATE OF OVER THE TOP TEN MOST

01:51:50.136 --> 01:51:51.538
AFFECTED CITIES- IN L. A.

01:51:51.604 --> 01:51:53.306
COUNTY OUT THERE. BUT IT'S NOT

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:55.075
JUST THAT THE INEQUITIES DEEPER

01:51:55.141 --> 01:51:56.009
WE KNOW WE HAVE A DIGITAL

01:51:56.076 --> 01:51:57.444
DIVIDE YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN

01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:58.478
EDUCATIONAL GET THAT'S ONLY

01:51:58.545 --> 01:51:59.979
BEEN GROWING. AS I WAS REALLY

01:52:00.046 --> 01:52:01.147
AT THIS I THINK WE HAVE TO BE

01:52:01.214 --> 01:52:02.849
INTENTIONAL ABOUT ENSURING THAT

01:52:02.916 --> 01:52:04.350
THE SCHOOLS IN THE HEART OF THE

01:52:04.417 --> 01:52:05.819
COMMUNITIES HAVE THE RESOURCES

01:52:05.885 --> 01:52:07.187
THEY NEED AFTER FRONT OF THE

01:52:07.253 --> 01:52:08.888
LINE. FOR VACCINES AND I TO

01:52:08.955 --> 01:52:09.923
FIND A LINE TO GET THE TEACHERS

01:52:09.989 --> 01:52:11.658
BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM.

01:52:11.724 --> 01:52:12.692
BECAUSE THEY WE'VE ALL OF THEM

01:52:12.759 --> 01:52:15.061
WERE VERY FOLLOWING NOW IF I

01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:16.296
EQUITY AT THE OF EVERY

01:52:16.362 --> 01:52:17.997
DISCUSSION FOR A YEAR. WE'RE

01:52:18.064 --> 01:52:18.498
NOT GONNA HAVE ANYTHING

01:52:18.565 --> 01:52:20.300
EQUITABLE SEEING SCHOOLS IN

01:52:20.366 --> 01:52:21.601
PREDOMINANTLY HIRING COMMUNITY

01:52:21.668 --> 01:52:24.437
OPEN UP ALREADY- AND WE'RE

01:52:24.504 --> 01:52:25.472
GONNA BE AT THE END OF THE LIST

01:52:25.538 --> 01:52:27.373
ONCE AGAIN AND SO. AS WE DO

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:28.775
THIS WE NEED TO THIS IN A SAFE

01:52:28.842 --> 01:52:37.150
WAY. IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE

01:52:37.217 --> 01:52:38.918
ARE PREPARED SUPPORT. EDUCATORS

01:52:38.985 --> 01:52:40.820
AND SCHOOLS BE SIX. AND THAT

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:42.322
WERE PARTNERS THEM. AND SO

01:52:42.388 --> 01:52:43.089
AFTER A LOT OF THE NOW AGAIN

01:52:43.156 --> 01:52:44.557
ONE MORE TIME. OF DAY I THINK

01:52:44.624 --> 01:52:45.291
IT'S A- WE DON'T FORGET THE

01:52:45.358 --> 01:52:46.693
ROLE THAT. AND THERE WAS. THAT

01:52:46.759 --> 01:52:49.796
THE SOME. THIS OUR- AND THE

01:52:49.863 --> 01:52:50.563
RESPECT THAT THEY- TO BE. WITH

01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:52.165
US. WITHIN MINUTES. WITH

01:52:52.232 --> 01:52:53.766
LEGISLATURE OUT THERE. THERE

01:52:53.833 --> 01:52:54.367
NOT A SINGLE TEACHER IT'S- TO

01:52:54.434 --> 01:52:56.169
WHO. DOESN'T SEE THEM. OF OUR

01:52:56.236 --> 01:52:57.604
SCHOOLS. OUT THERE BUT THEY

01:52:57.670 --> 01:52:58.238
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE

01:52:58.304 --> 01:53:00.473
SO. I HAVE. TO SAY THAT I TALK

01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:01.875
TO TEACHERS IN MY BACKYARD AND

01:53:01.941 --> 01:53:02.809
THEY'RE LIKE WE WANT TO GO

THEY'RE AFRAID WHEN THEY SEE

01:53:07.147 --> 01:53:08.381
THE RATES OF INFECTION CIVIL

01:53:08.448 --> 01:53:09.682

HAVE HASN'T BEEN. I OTHER

01:53:29.502 --> 01:53:30.970
MINORITY IN A LONG TIME THAT IS

01:53:31.037 --> 01:53:32.572
THE- YEAR. WE AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:34.240

YOU'RE AT AT. IN THE

01:53:36.676 --> 01:53:37.644
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING

AND TALKING TO US BECAUSE WE

01:53:38.912 --> 01:53:40.947

WORK. SORRY THANK YOU MISTER

01:54:10.476 --> 01:54:13.580
CHAIRMAN- I THINK FIRST I WANT

01:54:13.646 --> 01:54:14.914
TO AGREE WITH THE CHAIRMAN'S

01:54:14.981 --> 01:54:16.416
COMMENTS I THINK AT THE

01:54:16.482 --> 01:54:17.550
BEGINNING THIS IS WE NEED

01:54:17.617 --> 01:54:20.220
ACCOUNTABILITY- THERE WAS

01:54:20.286 --> 01:54:22.522
MONIES EXPENDED IN THIS LAST

01:54:22.589 --> 01:54:23.122
BUDGET THAT WENT OUT TO EVERY

01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:26.292
SCHOOL. AND THE REALITY IS SOME

01:54:26.359 --> 01:54:27.727
SCHOOLS DID A LOT BETTER JOB

01:54:27.794 --> 01:54:29.362
THAN OTHERS AT ATTEMPTING TO RE

01:54:29.429 --> 01:54:32.265
OPEN. AND SPENT THOSE VITAL

01:54:32.332 --> 01:54:34.400
DOLLARS TO HELP GET YOUR KIDS

01:54:34.467 --> 01:54:36.402
BACK INTO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION

01:54:36.469 --> 01:54:38.705
AS BEST AS POSSIBLE. AND

01:54:38.771 --> 01:54:41.441
LARGELY THAT WAS IN RURAL AREAS.

01:54:41.507 --> 01:54:46.145
LIKE I REPRESENT. MANY SCHOOLS

01:54:46.212 --> 01:54:47.513
AND IT'S NOT THAT THEY HAVE

01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:48.615
LOWER CASE RATES I HAVE TO

01:54:48.681 --> 01:54:49.983
COUNTIES HAD THE HIGHEST TEST

01:54:50.049 --> 01:54:52.619
POSITIVE HIGHEST TEST

01:54:52.685 --> 01:54:54.053
POSITIVITY RATE IN THE NATION.

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:57.156
AT ONE POINT. SO HAD HIGH RATES

01:54:57.223 --> 01:54:59.259
OF TRANSMISSION. BUT THEY FALL

01:54:59.325 --> 01:55:02.228
THE SCIENCE. CDC YOU SAID

01:55:02.295 --> 01:55:03.930
MONTHS AGO THAT YOU CAN SAFELY

01:55:03.997 --> 01:55:05.698
REOPEN YOUR SCHOOLS WITH

01:55:05.765 --> 01:55:08.501
MODIFICATIONS. AND SO MANY OPEN

01:55:08.568 --> 01:55:09.469
WHEN THE HIGH AND A HYBRID

01:55:09.535 --> 01:55:12.872
SYSTEM WITH MODIFICATIONS THEY

01:55:12.939 --> 01:55:13.539
BUT THEY HAD TO EXPAND THE

01:55:13.606 --> 01:55:15.441
MONIES TO MAKE SURE THEIR

01:55:15.508 --> 01:55:16.943
SCHOOLS WERE READY AND THEY

01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:17.977
COULD DO THE PP AND ALL THE

01:55:18.044 --> 01:55:19.812
DEVICE AND- ALL THE THINGS THAT

01:55:19.879 --> 01:55:22.048
WENT ALONG WITH IT. AND YET IN

01:55:22.115 --> 01:55:24.917
THIS. IN THIS BUDGET BECAUSE OF

01:55:24.984 --> 01:55:27.153
THE LCF FORMULAS IT IS. THESE

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:28.688
SCHOOLS GET UNDERFUNDED

01:55:28.755 --> 01:55:31.224
SIGNIFICANTLY. AND IF WE'RE

01:55:31.291 --> 01:55:33.192
GONNA GO ON THIS ONE OF MY

01:55:33.259 --> 01:55:34.594
BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL

01:55:34.661 --> 01:55:36.562
RIGHT NOW AS IT IS IF WE'RE

01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:37.697
GOING TO GO AND SEND THAT SAME

01:55:37.764 --> 01:55:39.799
MONEY BACK OUT TO DISTRICTS ON

01:55:39.866 --> 01:55:42.402
THE LCF FORMULA. THOSE RULES

01:55:42.468 --> 01:55:43.670
RULES SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO GET

01:55:43.736 --> 01:55:45.505
UNDERFUNDED AGAIN AND EVEN

01:55:45.571 --> 01:55:48.041
GROSSLY. EVEN MORE GROSSLY

01:55:48.107 --> 01:55:50.276
DISPROPORTIONATE WAY WHEN THEY

01:55:50.343 --> 01:55:52.378
ACTUALLY MANY OF THEM WERE THE

01:55:52.445 --> 01:55:53.846
ONES THAT SPENT THE MONEY TO RE

01:55:53.913 --> 01:55:55.548
OPEN WELL SOME OF THE VERY

01:55:55.615 --> 01:55:57.717
LARGE URBAN DISTRICTS DIDN'T

01:55:57.784 --> 01:55:59.752
OPEN AT ALL AND TOOK THOSE

01:55:59.819 --> 01:56:01.054
FUNDS JUST AS THE CHAIRMAN

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:02.655
SAID. TOOK THOSE FUNDS DID NOT

01:56:02.722 --> 01:56:04.190
REOPEN IT WAS NOT

01:56:04.257 --> 01:56:05.925
ACCOUNTABILITY SO WE NEED TO

01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:07.360
MAKE THAT RIGHT AND THERE'S

01:56:07.427 --> 01:56:08.695
BEEN TALKS ABOUT THIS ALREADY

01:56:08.761 --> 01:56:10.263
IT NEEDS TO GET IN THIS BILL

01:56:10.330 --> 01:56:12.031
ABOUT EQUALIZE FUNDING IN A

01:56:12.098 --> 01:56:13.933
MINIMUM FUNDING FOR THESE RURAL

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.868
SCHOOLS. WHO TALKED ABOUT MAYBE

01:56:15.935 --> 01:56:18.137
UNDER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:56:18.204 --> 01:56:18.771
EIGHTY EIGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE A

01:56:18.838 --> 01:56:19.739
MINIMUM FUNDING LEVEL TO

01:56:19.806 --> 01:56:21.374
EQUALIZE THE DISPROPORTIONATE

01:56:21.441 --> 01:56:23.376
FUNDING THAT IS THE RESULT OF

01:56:23.443 --> 01:56:25.845
PUTTING THIS OF A PORTION IT

01:56:25.912 --> 01:56:29.182
OUT ON LCF FORMULA. ALONE THAT

01:56:29.248 --> 01:56:31.818
NEEDS TO BE DONE SO THAT WE CAN

01:56:31.884 --> 01:56:33.386
REALLY TALK ABOUT EQUITY. IN

01:56:33.453 --> 01:56:34.354
ENSURING THAT BECAUSE WE ALL

01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:35.788
EVERY SCHOOL FACE THE SAME

01:56:35.855 --> 01:56:39.192
THINGS. WITH COVER NINETEEN.

01:56:39.258 --> 01:56:40.293
AND WE SHOULDN'T BE TREATING

01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:41.361
SOME DISTRICTS AND GIVING THEM

01:56:41.427 --> 01:56:42.862
LESS MONEY TO DEAL WITH THAT

01:56:42.929 --> 01:56:44.630
SAME VERY ISSUE ESPECIALLY WHEN

01:56:44.697 --> 01:56:45.665
THEY WERE THE ONES THAT DID THE

01:56:45.732 --> 01:56:46.933
WORK TO RE OPEN WHICH IS WHAT

01:56:46.999 --> 01:56:50.236
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- RIGHT NOW.

01:56:50.303 --> 01:56:51.571
I THINK THE PROBLEMS IS REALLY.

01:56:51.637 --> 01:56:53.573
INCONSISTENCY AND I WANT TO GO

01:56:53.639 --> 01:56:56.709
BACK- TO. THE ADMINISTRATION.

01:56:56.776 --> 01:56:57.477
BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:56:57.543 --> 01:56:59.545
IMPEDIMENTS TO RE OPENING RIGHT

01:56:59.612 --> 01:57:01.180
NOW IS THE BLUEPRINT FRAMEWORK.

01:57:01.247 --> 01:57:03.716
QUITE FRANKLY. AND IT WAS SAID

01:57:03.783 --> 01:57:05.284
EARLIER THAT- UNDER PURPLE TIER

01:57:05.351 --> 01:57:07.653
THAT ALLOWS SCHOOLS THE

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:08.254
FLEXIBILITY TO RE OPEN THAT'S

01:57:08.321 --> 01:57:11.958
NOT TRUE. AND K. THROUGH SIX

01:57:12.024 --> 01:57:14.394
CAN OPEN UNDER A WAIVER. THAT'S

01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:15.928
IT BUT IS IT NOT TRUE WHEN I

01:57:15.995 --> 01:57:19.499
WAS ASKING A MINISTRATION THAT

01:57:19.565 --> 01:57:20.533
SIX TO TWELVE. IF YOU DID NOT

01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:22.101
REOPEN YOUR SCHOOL IN THE FALL.

01:57:22.168 --> 01:57:24.871
WHEN IT WAS IN RED DEER. IF YOU

01:57:24.937 --> 01:57:26.639
ARE IN THE PURPLE TEAR RIGHT

01:57:26.706 --> 01:57:27.173
NOW YOU CANNOT REOPEN YOUR

01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:30.843
SCHOOL. UNDER PURPLE TEAR FOR

01:57:30.910 --> 01:57:38.651
SIX TO TWELVE IS NOT CORRECT. I

01:57:38.718 --> 01:57:39.385
HAVE A QUESTION TO JESSICA

01:57:39.452 --> 01:57:44.090
HOPELESS. YEAH AND JESSICA HOME

01:57:44.157 --> 01:57:48.294
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- AGAIN

01:57:48.361 --> 01:57:49.996
AS NOT A PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT

01:57:50.062 --> 01:57:52.598
BUT AND IS IN REGARD TO THE SIX

01:57:52.665 --> 01:57:55.168
THROUGH TWELVE QUESTION- YOU

01:57:55.234 --> 01:57:57.703
CAN OPEN THE FOR COHORT MOSCOW

01:57:57.770 --> 01:58:01.407
COURT A STUDENT- AND- CASE RATE

01:58:01.474 --> 01:58:02.442
PURSUANT TO THE CURRENT

01:58:02.508 --> 01:58:05.077
GUIDANCE IF YOU ARE ABOVE

01:58:05.144 --> 01:58:07.413
TWENTY FIVE- BUT SHIFTED REMIND

01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:09.282
FOLKS YOUR CONTACT AND- THAT

01:58:09.348 --> 01:58:12.618
PER. THOUSAND POSITIVE TEACHER

01:58:12.685 --> 01:58:13.753
UNDERSCORE AND THEN IF YOU'RE

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:17.590
ABOUT. TWENTY HUNDRED THOUSAND-

01:58:17.657 --> 01:58:21.194
THAT'S CURRENTLY A DELL- THE

01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:30.970
GREAT SIX WHICH. IN RIGHT HE

01:58:31.037 --> 01:58:32.338
YOU CAN HELP YOU CAN UP C

01:58:32.405 --> 01:58:33.873
HùI BUT YOU CAN DO A HIGH RE

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:35.675
OPENING AT IN PURPLE TO YEAR

01:58:35.741 --> 01:58:39.712
CAREER. WELL GREAT BUT IT'S YES.

01:58:39.779 --> 01:58:40.746
RIGHT SO THIS IS THE DISPARITY

01:58:40.813 --> 01:58:41.347
THAT WE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SO

01:58:41.414 --> 01:58:43.683
SCHOOLS THAT RIO IN HIGH IN THE-

01:58:43.749 --> 01:58:45.418
AND THERE'LL. TO SAY OPEN. AS

01:58:45.485 --> 01:58:46.018
LONG AS THEY OPEN IN THE FALL

01:58:46.085 --> 01:58:48.387
ALL THESE COUNTIES ARE IN TEAR.

01:58:48.454 --> 01:58:49.755
THERE'S STILL IN PURPLE TEAR

01:58:49.822 --> 01:58:52.225
BUT SOME. SCHOOLS ARE ALLOWED

01:58:52.291 --> 01:58:52.959
TO BE RE OPENED UNDER THEIR

01:58:53.025 --> 01:58:55.061
METRIC. BECAUSE THEY RE OPEN IN

01:58:55.127 --> 01:58:57.396
THE FALL BUT IF YOU DIDN'T

01:58:57.463 --> 01:58:59.665
REOPEN YOU CAN'T REOPEN NOW.

01:58:59.732 --> 01:59:01.534
IMAGINE THAT. THE DISPARITY

01:59:01.601 --> 01:59:03.202
THERE THEY'RE THEY'RE THE SAME

01:59:03.269 --> 01:59:06.172
TYPE OF SCHOOLS. SO IT'S EITHER

01:59:06.239 --> 01:59:07.440
OKAY TO OPEN IN PURPLE OR IT'S

01:59:07.507 --> 01:59:09.075
NOT BUT AS THERE'S NO

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:11.978
CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE BOARD SO

01:59:12.044 --> 01:59:12.612
I HAVE DISTRICTS THAT ARE READY

01:59:12.678 --> 01:59:15.481
TO RE OPEN. SIX THROUGH TWELVE

01:59:15.548 --> 01:59:17.450
AND THEY CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE

01:59:17.517 --> 01:59:17.917
THE PURPLE TIER SYSTEM

01:59:17.984 --> 01:59:20.253
FRAMEWORK. WHICH RIGHT NOW THIS

01:59:20.319 --> 01:59:22.588
BILL DOES NOTHING ABOUT. AND I

01:59:22.655 --> 01:59:23.623
THINK WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING

01:59:23.689 --> 01:59:24.590
ABOUT THAT THIS TIERED

01:59:24.657 --> 01:59:25.625
FRAMEWORK IS CREATED

01:59:25.691 --> 01:59:28.027
INCONSISTENCIES AND DESPITE

01:59:28.094 --> 01:59:31.731
DISPARITIES ACROSS. IT'S A GOOD

01:59:31.797 --> 01:59:32.698
THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN IS

01:59:32.765 --> 01:59:33.933
BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR GOT TO SET

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.636
THIS UP ARBITRARILY USING HIS

01:59:36.702 --> 01:59:38.571
OWN PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS.

01:59:38.638 --> 01:59:40.740
HIS OWN SCIENCE AND NONE OF US

01:59:40.806 --> 01:59:41.674
WERE INVOLVED IN THAT

01:59:41.741 --> 01:59:43.276
DISCUSSION AND THOSE AND NOW WE

01:59:43.342 --> 01:59:45.244
HAVE SCHOOLS THAT. SAME

01:59:45.311 --> 01:59:48.381
COUNTIES. SAME RISK. BUT SOME

01:59:48.447 --> 01:59:50.049
GET TO BE OPEN AND SOME DON'T.

01:59:50.116 --> 01:59:51.984
THAT'S WRONG YOU KNOW WE NEED

01:59:52.051 --> 01:59:55.655
TO FIX AS IT. DISPARITIES WE

01:59:55.721 --> 01:59:57.523
ALSO I MEAN TESTING TESTING IS

01:59:57.590 --> 01:59:59.058
GOING TO BE ANOTHER DISPARITY

01:59:59.125 --> 02:00:02.261
AND WE BROUGHT IT UP TODAY. SO

02:00:02.328 --> 02:00:04.130
UNDER THIS BILL IF YOU OPEN

02:00:04.196 --> 02:00:05.731
BEFORE MARCH FIFTEENTH OR IF

02:00:05.798 --> 02:00:08.968
YOU'RE ALREADY RE OPENED. OR IF

02:00:09.035 --> 02:00:09.468
YOU HAVE A PLAN BY MARCH

02:00:09.535 --> 02:00:11.237
FIFTEENTH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO

02:00:11.304 --> 02:00:16.342
TEST. NO TESTING REQUIREMENTS.

02:00:16.409 --> 02:00:18.010
HOWEVER IF YOU IF YOU'RE A

02:00:18.077 --> 02:00:19.512
SCHOOL THAT IS UNABLE TO REOPEN

02:00:19.579 --> 02:00:21.480
FOR WHATEVER REASON MAYBE THEY

02:00:21.547 --> 02:00:23.149
DON'T GET IT TO A BARGAINING

02:00:23.215 --> 02:00:24.317
AGREEMENT WITH YOUR LOCAL

02:00:24.383 --> 02:00:27.486
UNION. IN TIME. BUT IF YOU'RE A

02:00:27.553 --> 02:00:28.220
DISTRICT THAT COMES AFTER MARCH

02:00:28.287 --> 02:00:30.156
FIFTEENTH. YOU ARE GOING TO BE

02:00:30.222 --> 02:00:31.490
UNDER THE TESTING REQUIREMENTS

02:00:31.557 --> 02:00:33.426
WHICH IS WEEKLY IF YOU'RE A

02:00:33.492 --> 02:00:35.494
PURPLE TIER AND EVERY TWO

02:00:35.561 --> 02:00:38.364
WEEKS. UNDER READ HERE. NOW IS

02:00:38.431 --> 02:00:39.298
THAT CORRECT I'M JUST GONNA ASK

02:00:39.365 --> 02:00:42.335
BOTH ERIN. AND THE

02:00:42.401 --> 02:00:44.403
ADMINISTRATION IS THAT CORRECT.

02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:45.871
WITH WITH THE A CAVIAR THAT IF

02:00:45.938 --> 02:00:47.073
YOU WERE IN THE PURPLE TEAR

02:00:47.139 --> 02:00:48.307
THAT THERE IS A PROCESS OF THE

02:00:48.374 --> 02:00:49.375
BILL BY WHICH YOU HAVE TO RUN

02:00:49.442 --> 02:00:51.911
YOUR A SAFETY PLAN BY THE

ESTABLISHED THE STATE LEVEL-

02:00:55.815 --> 02:00:58.217
IT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS

02:00:58.284 --> 02:00:59.552
ADEQUATE FOR SAFETY PURPOSES.

02:00:59.619 --> 02:01:01.087
CORRECT RIGHT BUT IF YOU IF YOU

02:01:01.153 --> 02:01:02.622
ARE ALREADY OPEN. FOR YOU HAVE

02:01:02.688 --> 02:01:03.956

YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO TEST DO A

02:01:05.725 --> 02:01:07.693
SYMPTOMATIC TESTING CORRECT. IF

02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:09.629
YOU HAVE ALREADY HAVE A PLAN

02:01:09.695 --> 02:01:11.197
ADOPTED IN PLACE REGARDLESS OF

02:01:11.263 --> 02:01:12.398
WHETHER YOU'VE OPENED BY MARCH

02:01:12.465 --> 02:01:13.933
FIFTEENTH YOU DO NOT HAVE TO

FOLLOW THE NEW CD PH A

02:01:15.501 --> 02:01:16.902
SYMPTOMATIC TESTING CURRENT AND

02:01:16.969 --> 02:01:18.137
IF YOU'RE A SCHOOL THAT DOESN'T

02:01:18.204 --> 02:01:20.239
AFTER. YOU WILL HAVE TO NOTE

02:01:20.306 --> 02:01:21.874
THERE'S NO IF ANDS OR BUTS

02:01:21.941 --> 02:01:23.476
ABOUT IT YOU WILL BE TESTING.

02:01:23.542 --> 02:01:26.078
RIGHT THAT IS WHAT IS IN THE

02:01:26.145 --> 02:01:27.380
GUIDANCE YES OKAY.

02:01:27.446 --> 02:01:28.748
ADMINISTRATION DO YOU DISAGREE

02:01:28.814 --> 02:01:29.782
WITH THAT IS THAT WHAT THIS

02:01:29.849 --> 02:01:34.220
PROVIDES. WE DON'T DISAGREE

02:01:34.286 --> 02:01:35.988
ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOTE THAT AND

02:01:36.055 --> 02:01:38.824
THE PURPOSE BEHIND AND- YOU'RE

02:01:38.891 --> 02:01:41.127
GRANDFATHERING IN FOLKS WERE

02:01:41.193 --> 02:01:43.996
OPEN- IS THAT THEY HAVE A TRACK

02:01:44.063 --> 02:01:45.531
RECORD THAT WE CAN LOOK AT IN

02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:47.366
TERMS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY THE

02:01:47.433 --> 02:01:48.467
TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY HAVE

02:01:48.534 --> 02:01:49.869
HAD OUTBREAKS THERE LOCAL. I'M

02:01:49.935 --> 02:01:51.370
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WOULD GO

02:01:51.437 --> 02:01:52.538
IN AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL

02:01:52.605 --> 02:01:54.907
ASSISTANCE FOUR OR ASK THEM TO

02:01:54.974 --> 02:01:57.009
CLOSE- FOR IN PERSON

02:01:57.076 --> 02:01:58.978
INSTRUCTION- HOWEVER IF THEY'VE

02:01:59.045 --> 02:02:00.880
BEEN OPERATING WITHOUT

02:02:00.946 --> 02:02:03.182
OUTBREAK- FOR A PERIOD OF TIME

02:02:03.249 --> 02:02:04.950
THAN IT IT AND THEY'VE BEEN YOU

02:02:05.017 --> 02:02:06.752
KNOW COMPLYING WITH HEALTH AND

02:02:06.819 --> 02:02:07.653
SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. WHEN THEY

02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:10.690
HAVE THAT AND HISTORY AS BEING

02:02:10.756 --> 02:02:12.858
OPEN AND BEING UNSAFE IN PERSON

02:02:12.925 --> 02:02:15.094
THAT- YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO

02:02:15.161 --> 02:02:16.696
DISRUPT- FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T

02:02:16.762 --> 02:02:18.130
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT HISTORY OF

02:02:18.197 --> 02:02:19.331
BEING OPEN AND SAFE AND SO

02:02:19.398 --> 02:02:21.000
IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY

02:02:21.067 --> 02:02:22.368
HAVE. HEALTH AND SAFETY

02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:23.736
PARAMETERS TEMPLATE THAT ARE

02:02:23.803 --> 02:02:25.805
NOT JUST ARBITRARY THAT ARE

02:02:25.871 --> 02:02:27.573
SUPPORTED BOTH BY THE OF THE

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:30.009
CDC AS WELL AS MANY SCIENTIFIC

02:02:30.076 --> 02:02:32.445
REPORTS WE HAVE POSTED ON OUR

02:02:32.511 --> 02:02:33.979
WEBSITE. AND TO ENSURE THAT

02:02:34.046 --> 02:02:35.915
THEY CAN OPEN RECENTLY AND NOT

02:02:35.981 --> 02:02:37.016
CALLED OUTBREAK THE NON THAT

02:02:37.083 --> 02:02:45.157
THAT IS REASONING. THAT OKAY

02:02:45.224 --> 02:02:46.625
LONG LONG ANSWER BUT SAME

02:02:46.692 --> 02:02:47.226
RESULT GUYS YOU'RE GOING TO

02:02:47.293 --> 02:02:48.294
SOME. THAT WILL REQUIRE TO DO A

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:49.895
SYMPTOM TEST. AND OTHERS THAT

02:02:49.962 --> 02:02:51.197
WERE HAVE. A AND OTHERS THAT

02:02:51.263 --> 02:02:52.598
WERE HAVE TO. WRITE AND THEY'RE

02:02:52.665 --> 02:02:53.799
GONNA HAVE TO USE VITAL. THAT

02:02:53.866 --> 02:02:55.434
WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT TO PAY

02:02:55.501 --> 02:02:57.703
FOR THAT TESTING. YOU'RE GOING

02:02:57.770 --> 02:02:59.972
TO CREATE A DISPARITY THERE AND

02:03:00.039 --> 02:03:00.840
IT'S A DISPARITY THAT WE DON'T

02:03:00.906 --> 02:03:03.743
NEED. BECAUSE CDC DOES NOT

02:03:03.809 --> 02:03:06.412
REQUIRE YOU TO DO TESTING. CDC

02:03:06.479 --> 02:03:07.980
DOES NOT REQUIRE YOU TO DO A

02:03:08.047 --> 02:03:09.849
SYMPTOMATIC TSTING AND THE

02:03:09.915 --> 02:03:12.418
EXPERIENCE ACROSS THE NATION.

02:03:12.485 --> 02:03:13.953
AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE

02:03:14.019 --> 02:03:14.987
SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN OPEN IS

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:16.188
THAT YOU CAN OPEN SAFELY

02:03:16.255 --> 02:03:18.023
WITHOUT A SYMPTOMATIC TESTING

02:03:18.090 --> 02:03:20.192
AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN OUTBREAKS.

02:03:20.259 --> 02:03:22.595
AND IN FACT THE FACTS ARE. IN

02:03:22.661 --> 02:03:23.963
THOSE SCHOOLS THE RATE OF

02:03:24.029 --> 02:03:25.664
TRANSMISSION IS MUCH LOWER THAN

02:03:25.731 --> 02:03:28.400
WHAT WE SEE IN THE COMMUNITY.

02:03:28.467 --> 02:03:30.002
AND AGAIN CITY SEES BEEN SAYING

02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:31.971
THIS FOR MONTHS DOCTOR FELT YOU

02:03:32.037 --> 02:03:33.305
HAD A MUCH PUBLICIZED.

02:03:33.372 --> 02:03:34.540
CONVERSATION WITH THE GOVERNOR

02:03:34.607 --> 02:03:37.877
HIMSELF. WHERE HE SAID YOU CAN

02:03:37.943 --> 02:03:39.712
SAFELY REOPEN SCHOOLS EVEN

02:03:39.779 --> 02:03:41.280
WHERE YOU HAVE HIGHER RATES OF

02:03:41.347 --> 02:03:43.949
COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION. AND THE

02:03:44.016 --> 02:03:45.217
GOVERNOR SAID HE UNDERSTOOD

02:03:45.284 --> 02:03:47.086
THIS AND YET HE HASN'T CHANGED

02:03:47.153 --> 02:03:48.754
THIS IN HIS CDPH GUIDELINE

02:03:48.821 --> 02:03:51.457
PROTOCOL. AND HE'S GOING TO

02:03:51.524 --> 02:03:53.259
REQUIRE SCHOOLS THAT ARE THAT

02:03:53.325 --> 02:03:55.861
ARE UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH. TO GO

02:03:55.928 --> 02:03:58.731
AFTER THAT MARCH FIFTEENTH DATE

02:03:58.798 --> 02:03:59.932
AREN'T OPEN IN SCHOOLS TO THEN

02:03:59.999 --> 02:04:02.434
ABIDE BY THIS TESTING PROTOCOL

02:04:02.501 --> 02:04:04.103
THAT ISN'T NECESSARY. AND THAT

02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:07.840
IS COSTLY. SO WE NEED TO STOP

02:04:07.907 --> 02:04:10.142
HAVING THESE DISPARITIES THAT I

02:04:10.209 --> 02:04:10.709
THINK A LOT OF US HAVE HAVE

02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:12.978
TOUCHED ON YEAH IT IS SAFE TO

02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:14.313
OPEN SCHOOLS WE KNOW THE

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:16.448
MITIGATING STRATEGIES SCHOOLS

02:04:16.515 --> 02:04:18.150
ARE ALREADY EMPLOYING THEM

02:04:18.217 --> 02:04:20.252
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE

02:04:20.319 --> 02:04:22.488
SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO SO AND

02:04:22.555 --> 02:04:24.456
BEGIN THE REAL IT. MANY SCHOOLS

02:04:24.523 --> 02:04:25.424
OF ART OF YEP AND I THINK WE

02:04:25.491 --> 02:04:26.892
COULD HAVE RE OPENED OUR

02:04:26.959 --> 02:04:30.362
SCHOOLS. TWO MONTHS AGO. WE

02:04:30.429 --> 02:04:31.096
COULD HAVE BEEN HAVING THESE

02:04:31.163 --> 02:04:32.965
CONVERSATIONS MONTHS AGO WE

02:04:33.032 --> 02:04:33.933
SHOULD TO COME TO A TO. A

02:04:33.999 --> 02:04:36.068
DETERMINATION MONTHS AGO TO DO

02:04:36.135 --> 02:04:37.837
THIS I RECOGNIZE A LOT OF AS WE

02:04:37.903 --> 02:04:40.039
CAN BEEN BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR.

02:04:40.105 --> 02:04:42.842
REFUSES TO MOVE. YEAH FROM HIS

02:04:42.908 --> 02:04:44.710
OWN POSITION FROM AN ARBITRARY

02:04:44.777 --> 02:04:46.178
WAY OF DOING THIS. THIS

02:04:46.245 --> 02:04:47.780
RESULTED IN OUR STUDENTS

02:04:47.847 --> 02:04:50.549
LANGUISHING. AT HOME AND NOT

02:04:50.616 --> 02:04:52.351
BEING ABLE TO HAVE IN PERSON

02:04:52.418 --> 02:04:54.520
INSTRUCTION AND OUR PARENTS ARE

02:04:54.587 --> 02:04:59.792
FRUSTRATED AND RIGHTFULLY SO.

02:04:59.859 --> 02:05:00.659
SO THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE

02:05:00.726 --> 02:05:02.528
AND I AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE

02:05:02.595 --> 02:05:03.896
TO SEE US MAKE THOSE CHANGES TO

02:05:03.963 --> 02:05:05.631
ENSURE THIS IS EQUAL ACROSS THE

02:05:05.698 --> 02:05:06.232
BOARD THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO

02:05:06.298 --> 02:05:08.801
HAVE. DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS IN

02:05:08.868 --> 02:05:10.469
DIFFERENT AREAS AND EVEN IN THE

02:05:10.536 --> 02:05:12.238
SAME COUNTIES WHERE ONE SCHOOL

02:05:12.304 --> 02:05:13.305
IS ABLE TO DO THIS BUT ANOTHER

02:05:13.372 --> 02:05:15.040
SCHOOL HAS TO DO SOMETHING

02:05:15.107 --> 02:05:18.077
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. I DON'T

02:05:18.143 --> 02:05:18.644
WANT TO CREATE THAT KIND OF

02:05:18.711 --> 02:05:27.152
SITUATION. THANK YOU DR WORK.

02:05:27.219 --> 02:05:28.254
YES I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:29.255
THANK EVERYBODY FOR THIS

02:05:29.321 --> 02:05:31.090
DISCUSSION A LOT OF QUESTIONS

02:05:31.156 --> 02:05:32.725
THAT I HAD WALKING IN HAVE BEEN

02:05:32.791 --> 02:05:35.027
ANSWERED- HOWEVER I DO HAVE

02:05:35.094 --> 02:05:38.197
SOME SOME THAT THAT DO LINGER-

02:05:38.264 --> 02:05:41.166
A FIRST OF ALL HI. MY DISTRICT.

02:05:41.233 --> 02:05:42.968
I HAVE LIKE OVER EIGHTY SCHOOL

02:05:43.035 --> 02:05:45.371
DISTRICTS EIGHT ZERO SCHOOL

02:05:45.437 --> 02:05:47.406
DISTRICTS. MANY OF THEM ARE

02:05:47.473 --> 02:05:50.409
TINY AND WHAT I HEAR FROM THE

02:05:50.476 --> 02:05:52.444
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS OF

02:05:52.511 --> 02:05:54.246
SCHOOLS- DISTRICTS THE SCHOOLS

02:05:54.313 --> 02:05:55.814
IN THE FIVE COUNTIES I

02:05:55.881 --> 02:05:58.684
REPRESENT IS THAT THAT LARGE

02:05:58.751 --> 02:05:59.885
LARGER SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN

02:05:59.952 --> 02:06:01.787
URBAN AREAS ARE THE ONES ARE

02:06:01.854 --> 02:06:03.022
GOING TO BE ABLE TO RE OPEN THE

02:06:03.088 --> 02:06:05.124
ONES THAT ARE OUT IN THE MORE

02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:07.226
RURAL AREAS ARE NOT GOING TO BE

02:06:07.293 --> 02:06:09.295
ABLE TO RE OPEN. AND PART OF

02:06:09.361 --> 02:06:11.163
THE CONCERN IS AROUND THE

02:06:11.230 --> 02:06:13.365
CADENCE FOR TESTING. AND THE

02:06:13.432 --> 02:06:15.134
CHALLENGE OF GATHERING THE

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:16.936
TESTS AND EVEN GETTING THEM TO

02:06:17.002 --> 02:06:19.071
BE PROCESSED IN A TIMELY WAY-

02:06:19.138 --> 02:06:20.606
EVEN IN UNDER A HYBRID LEARNING

02:06:20.673 --> 02:06:21.907
SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE A

02:06:21.974 --> 02:06:24.243
DIFFICULT. LET ME GIVE AN

02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:25.511
EXAMPLE OF HOW DIFFICULT THAT

02:06:25.577 --> 02:06:27.379
MIGHT BE IN DEL NORTE COUNTY

02:06:27.446 --> 02:06:29.014
RIGHT NOW- FOR THIS NORTH

02:06:29.081 --> 02:06:30.149
COUNTY NORTHWEST COUNTY IN

02:06:30.215 --> 02:06:32.151
CALIFORNIA. YOU CAN'T GET FROM

02:06:32.217 --> 02:06:34.586
NORTH TO SOUTH ON ANY GIVEN DAY

02:06:34.653 --> 02:06:36.188
BECAUSE THE ROADS CLOSED. WOULD

02:06:36.255 --> 02:06:37.523
HAVE LANDSLIDES FOR THE LAST

02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:39.491
WEEK SEVERAL WEEKS. YOU

02:06:39.558 --> 02:06:41.060
COULDN'T GET A TESTING YOU CAN

02:06:41.126 --> 02:06:42.528
GET TRANSPORTED IF YOU DOUBT IF

02:06:42.594 --> 02:06:44.330
YOU WANTED TO YOU DID MAYBE YOU

02:06:44.396 --> 02:06:46.098
COULD FLY IT OUT. SO THAT

02:06:46.165 --> 02:06:48.267
DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T- EXACTLY-

02:06:48.334 --> 02:06:50.536
DO ANYTHING TO LOWER THE COSTS

02:06:50.602 --> 02:06:53.005
FOR THAT. AND SO- SO THERE'S

02:06:53.072 --> 02:06:54.106
THERE WE CERTAINLY HAVE

02:06:54.173 --> 02:06:55.841
CONCERNS WITH THAT AND THE

02:06:55.908 --> 02:06:58.177
DISPARITY. AND THEN WHEN YOU

02:06:58.243 --> 02:06:59.111
ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO THE CADENCE

02:06:59.178 --> 02:07:01.981
TESTING- THE ENORMOUS COSTS

02:07:02.047 --> 02:07:03.415
THAT ARE GOING TO BE ASSOCIATED

02:07:03.482 --> 02:07:04.783
WITH WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:06.118
THEY'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF MONEY

02:07:06.185 --> 02:07:08.687
FOR THAT- IN NOT TO IN THE NOT

02:07:08.754 --> 02:07:10.189
TOO DISTANT FUTURE SHOULD THEY

02:07:10.255 --> 02:07:11.223
HAVE TO UNDERGO SOME OF THE KEY

02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:15.027
THE TESTING CADENCE THAT'S

02:07:15.094 --> 02:07:17.062
THAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED-

02:07:17.129 --> 02:07:19.264
APPRECIATE WHAT I DID. I'VE HAD

02:07:19.331 --> 02:07:20.966
PARRAMATTA CONFUSION- BUT IT IT

02:07:21.033 --> 02:07:22.067
CLEAR FROM NOW BUT THERE WAS A

02:07:22.134 --> 02:07:24.236
LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT. AND NEW

02:07:24.303 --> 02:07:26.305
M. O. USE. THAT MIGHT HAVE TO

02:07:26.372 --> 02:07:28.640
BE DONE- WHICH DOESN'T APPEAR

02:07:28.707 --> 02:07:30.509
TO BE HAPPENING AND SO THAT'S

02:07:30.576 --> 02:07:32.478
THAT'S HELPFUL- THERE'S CONCERN

02:07:32.544 --> 02:07:33.712
THAT VACCINES WOULD BE

02:07:33.779 --> 02:07:36.148
REQUIRED- EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE

02:07:36.215 --> 02:07:37.783
TO BE REQUIRED TO BE VACCINATED

02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:39.051
AND THAT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE

02:07:39.118 --> 02:07:40.152
THE CASE SO THERE'S A LOT OF

02:07:40.219 --> 02:07:41.186
CLARITY THAT'S COME OUT OF THIS

02:07:41.253 --> 02:07:43.622
TODAY. BUT IT JUST GOES TO SHOW

02:07:43.689 --> 02:07:45.491
HOW CHALLENGING THIS CAN BE.

02:07:45.557 --> 02:07:46.358
ONE AREA THAT IS A HUGE

02:07:46.425 --> 02:07:49.528
CHALLENGE FOR US. AND WE TALKED

02:07:49.595 --> 02:07:52.064
ABOUT PARA PROFESSIONALS- YES

02:07:52.131 --> 02:07:54.133
THERE MAY INDEED HAVE BEEN PARA

02:07:54.199 --> 02:07:55.267
PROFESSIONALS THAT WERE LAID

02:07:55.334 --> 02:07:57.369
OFF IN A LOT OF DISTRICTS. BUT

02:07:57.436 --> 02:08:00.005
ON ANY GIVEN DAY IN A LOT OF MY

02:08:00.072 --> 02:08:02.107
DISTRICT THEY COULDN'T HIRE

02:08:02.174 --> 02:08:04.810
PREPARE PROFESSIONAL. IF THEY

02:08:04.877 --> 02:08:05.377
WANTED TO BECAUSE THEY DON'T

02:08:05.444 --> 02:08:09.214
EXIST. THEY DON'T EXIST YOU

02:08:09.281 --> 02:08:11.250
CAN'T GET THE STAFFING THAT YOU

02:08:11.316 --> 02:08:13.619
NEED. AND YET IT'S GOING TO BE

02:08:13.685 --> 02:08:16.522
REQUIRED MY UNDERSTANDING UNDER

02:08:16.588 --> 02:08:18.290
THE LEARNING LOST PART OF THIS

02:08:18.357 --> 02:08:20.492
BILL THESE BILL. IT'S GOING TO

02:08:20.559 --> 02:08:23.128
BE REQUIRED SO IF YOU IF YOU

02:08:23.195 --> 02:08:25.064
DON'T HAVE PEOPLE TO HIRE HOW

02:08:25.130 --> 02:08:27.499
DO YOU HIRE THEM WHAT DO YOU DO

02:08:27.566 --> 02:08:27.900
IN THOSE IN THOSE

02:08:27.966 --> 02:08:29.768
CIRCUMSTANCES. AND DOES THAT

02:08:29.835 --> 02:08:31.403
MEAN THAT THAT ARE DISTRICTS

02:08:31.470 --> 02:08:34.206
FURTHER LOSE OUT- SO I'D LOVE

02:08:34.273 --> 02:08:36.542
TO KNOW. IF YOU CAN'T HIRE PARA

02:08:36.608 --> 02:08:38.677
PROFESSIONALS. ARE WE GOING TO

02:08:38.744 --> 02:08:40.579
JUST BE MORE DISPROPORTIONATELY

02:08:40.646 --> 02:08:42.114
DISADVANTAGED IN ART AND SOME

02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:43.715
ARE RURAL AREAS SO THAT'S

02:08:43.782 --> 02:08:47.152
THAT'S MY QUESTION. SO THE

02:08:47.219 --> 02:08:48.287
LANGUAGE IS THE BILL AS YOU

02:08:48.353 --> 02:08:50.222
SAID DOES REQUIRE THE 10% OF

02:08:50.289 --> 02:08:51.857
EACH ELLIE AS LEARNING LOSS

02:08:51.924 --> 02:08:53.759
FUNDS BE UTILIZED FOR THESE

02:08:53.826 --> 02:08:55.928
PERFECTION ALL'S. AND OBVIOUSLY

02:08:55.994 --> 02:08:58.097
WE DON'T AND SAY EXACTLY WHICH

02:08:58.163 --> 02:08:59.331
TYPES OF SERVICES AS PER

02:08:59.398 --> 02:09:00.199
PROFESSIONALS WOULD BE

02:09:00.265 --> 02:09:02.768
PROVIDING- BUT IN THIS SCENARIO

02:09:02.835 --> 02:09:05.504
YOU DESCRIBE IF AND ONLY A-

02:09:05.571 --> 02:09:07.673
COULD NOT FIND ANY PARA

02:09:07.739 --> 02:09:11.176
PROFESSIONALS TO HIRE OVER THE-

02:09:11.243 --> 02:09:12.344
COURSE OF THE GRANTCHESTER

02:09:12.411 --> 02:09:14.646
SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO.

02:09:14.713 --> 02:09:16.215
THEN PRESUMABLY THEY WOULD NOT

02:09:16.281 --> 02:09:17.049
BE ALLOWED TO SPEND A PORTION

02:09:17.116 --> 02:09:18.817
OF THEIR FUNDS. UNDER THE WAY

02:09:18.884 --> 02:09:19.852
THE BILL CERTAINLY WRITTEN SO

02:09:19.918 --> 02:09:20.953
THAT WOULD BE A

02:09:21.019 --> 02:09:22.888
DISPROPORTIONAL. DISSIPATE

02:09:22.955 --> 02:09:24.289
DISADVANTAGE TO IN A RURAL AREA

02:09:24.356 --> 02:09:26.258
SIMPLY COULDN'T FIND THAT

02:09:26.325 --> 02:09:30.162
STAFFING BECAUSE. IT DOESN'T

02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.762
EXIST IN SOME OF THESE AREAS.

02:09:30.829 --> 02:09:32.698
SO WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IS IF IT

02:09:32.764 --> 02:09:34.466
COULD BE DEMONSTRATED THAT IT'S

02:09:34.533 --> 02:09:36.001
THAT THAT THAT JUST CAN'T

02:09:36.068 --> 02:09:37.736
HAPPEN OR WON'T HAPPEN.

02:09:37.803 --> 02:09:40.405
FLEXIBILITY THE ONE SIZE FITS

02:09:40.472 --> 02:09:42.274
ALL APPROACH TO ALL THE THINGS

02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:44.443
WE DO IN THIS BUILDING. REALLY

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:46.111
REALLY DISPROPORTIONATELY

02:09:46.178 --> 02:09:48.046
DISADVANTAGED RURAL COMMUNITIES

02:09:48.113 --> 02:09:51.817
THEY REALLY DO ON A DAILY BASIS.

02:09:51.884 --> 02:09:53.752
AND YOU CAN TAKE THESE THINGS

02:09:53.819 --> 02:09:55.521
THESE KINDS A DISPROPORTIONATE

02:09:55.587 --> 02:09:57.489
THE DISADVANTAGING AND YOU CAN

02:09:57.556 --> 02:10:00.292
TRANSLATE THAT TO URBAN CENTERS

02:10:00.359 --> 02:10:03.395
AS WELL. UNDER SERVICED URBAN

02:10:03.462 --> 02:10:05.831
CENTERS LIKE IN LOSE IN AND

02:10:05.898 --> 02:10:07.766
MISSED RIVAS IS DISTRICT AND IN

02:10:07.833 --> 02:10:10.002
MANY OTHER MEMBERS DISTRICTS IN

02:10:10.068 --> 02:10:13.038
HERE. SO IT'S IT IS IT FEELS IN

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:14.773
MANY WAYS THAT. THE RICH GET

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:17.910
RICHER. AND THOSE THAT ARE

02:10:17.976 --> 02:10:18.610
STRUGGLING CONTINUE TO

02:10:18.677 --> 02:10:20.479
STRUGGLE. YOU CAN YOU CAN EVEN

02:10:20.546 --> 02:10:22.581
ADD INTERNET ACCESS TO THAT TOO

02:10:22.648 --> 02:10:23.549
BECAUSE I KNOW IN SOME OF HER

02:10:23.615 --> 02:10:25.317
AREAS AND SOME OF THE OTHER

02:10:25.384 --> 02:10:27.252
OTHER MEMBERS IN HERE IN LARGER

02:10:27.319 --> 02:10:28.387
URBAN AREAS THEY DON'T HAVE

02:10:28.453 --> 02:10:30.022
INTERNET ACCESS EITHER AND THEY

02:10:30.088 --> 02:10:32.457
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WORK ON

02:10:32.524 --> 02:10:33.058
THAT DISTANCE LEARNING PART OF

02:10:33.125 --> 02:10:37.996
IT. SO WE NEED FLEXIBILITY. AND

02:10:38.063 --> 02:10:40.566
ALSO RECOGNITION THAT LIFE IS

02:10:40.632 --> 02:10:41.867
DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF

02:10:41.934 --> 02:10:44.636
THE STATE AND THAT'S OFTEN

02:10:44.703 --> 02:10:45.137
WHAT'S MISSING FROM OUR

02:10:45.204 --> 02:10:49.241
CONVERSATIONS. I JUST WANNA

02:10:49.308 --> 02:10:50.442
CLARIFY JUST BASING YOUR

02:10:50.509 --> 02:10:52.678
COMMENTS DR WOULD SO AGAIN IT'S

02:10:52.744 --> 02:10:55.480
ONLY A TEN PERCENT- IT'S ONLY

02:10:55.547 --> 02:10:57.849
10% SET ASIDE- THE RESOURCES

02:10:57.916 --> 02:11:00.118
ARE MEANT FOR ADDITIONAL

02:11:00.185 --> 02:11:02.254
RESOURCES SO THIS IS. FOR

02:11:02.321 --> 02:11:04.423
BILLION ON TOP OF WHAT THEY

02:11:04.489 --> 02:11:05.991
WOULD NORMALLY GET THROUGH L.

02:11:06.058 --> 02:11:10.062
C. F. F. SO IN A SENSE WE

02:11:10.128 --> 02:11:11.396
BELIEVE IT'S MUCH EASIER IF

02:11:11.463 --> 02:11:12.598
THEY ARE GOING TO GET

02:11:12.664 --> 02:11:14.166
ADDITIONAL THIS IS ADDITIONAL

02:11:14.233 --> 02:11:17.536
IN PERSON. IS NOT MEANT TO BE

LET ME JUST FINISH AND THEN YOU

02:11:24.443 --> 02:11:28.981
CAN MAKE A COMMENT. SO AGAIN-

02:11:29.047 --> 02:11:30.749
WE THOUGHT IT WAS A FAIR SET

02:11:30.816 --> 02:11:32.751
ASIDE BECAUSE IT'S MUCH EASIER

02:11:32.818 --> 02:11:36.455
FRANKLY. TO GET- PERRIS HIRED

02:11:36.521 --> 02:11:39.258
THEN TEACHERS HIGHER AND SO. IF

02:11:39.324 --> 02:11:40.225
YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING IN

02:11:40.292 --> 02:11:41.393
PERSON EDUCATION THOSE ARE

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:44.363
REALLY YOUR- BRITISH FORCES A

02:11:44.429 --> 02:11:45.297
LETTER TELLING ME IN YOUR

02:11:45.364 --> 02:11:47.132
COMMUNITY. YES I THINK IT'S

02:11:47.199 --> 02:11:48.834
HIGH TEACHER THAT WE CAN A

02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:51.036
DIFFERENT THIS CALL IS NOT EASY

02:11:51.103 --> 02:11:52.271
TO HIRE TEACHERS EITHER I MEAN

02:11:52.337 --> 02:11:53.405
YOU KNOW YOU COULD YOU COULD

02:11:56.508 --> 02:11:58.310
THROUGH TO- DISTANCE LEARNING.

02:11:58.377 --> 02:11:59.478
IT DOESN'T WORK IN A LOT OF

02:11:59.544 --> 02:12:00.612
AREAS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE

02:12:00.679 --> 02:12:01.480
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DISTANCE

02:12:01.546 --> 02:12:03.582
LEARNING. SO YOU CAN EVEN HIRE

02:12:03.649 --> 02:12:05.183
THE PEOPLE. TO PROVIDE THE

02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:06.285
SERVICE BECAUSE IF YOU HIRE THE%

02:12:06.351 --> 02:12:07.519
PEOPLE THEY COULDN'T GET TO THE

02:12:07.586 --> 02:12:08.854
PEOPLE THAT NEED IT BECAUSE WE

02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:10.389
DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO

02:12:10.455 --> 02:12:12.324
THAT BUT BUT AGAIN THIS IS SAM.

02:12:12.391 --> 02:12:13.358
THIS IS FOR ADDITIONAL

02:12:13.425 --> 02:12:14.826
RESOURCES SO I KNOW THIS COULD

02:12:14.893 --> 02:12:16.361
BE CONTEMPLATED FOR SUMMER

02:12:16.428 --> 02:12:17.562
SCHOOL SO YOU COULD HAVE THE

02:12:17.629 --> 02:12:20.499
SAME PARENTS WERE WORKING FOR

02:12:20.565 --> 02:12:21.199

02:12:24.736 --> 02:12:27.673
SCHOOL YEAR- BE PART. OF THE

SUMMER THE FOLLOWING YEAR OR

02:12:29.374 --> 02:12:31.209
AFTER SCHOOL SO THIS IS NOT.

02:12:31.276 --> 02:12:32.711
SAYING YOU HAVE TO GO HIRE

02:12:32.778 --> 02:12:34.680
ANYBODY JUST GIVES YOU.

02:12:34.746 --> 02:12:36.548
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON TOP OF

02:12:36.615 --> 02:12:38.650
YOUR NORMAL. SCHOOL DAYS COULD

02:12:38.717 --> 02:12:39.885
BE SUMMER. COULD BE AFTER

02:12:39.951 --> 02:12:41.853
SCHOOL BEFORE SCHOOL. THIS IS

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:43.689
MEANT TO BE ON TOP OF ALREADY

02:12:43.755 --> 02:12:45.691
WHICH AGAIN FOR ELSE SILVA. AND

02:12:45.757 --> 02:12:46.858
I AND I PRAY AND I APPRECIATE

02:12:46.925 --> 02:12:47.993
THAT I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST

02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:49.594
SAY THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO USE.

02:12:49.661 --> 02:12:51.763
YOU KNOW. TECHNOLOGY FOR SOME

02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:52.597
OF THE PARA PROFESSIONAL.

02:12:52.664 --> 02:12:53.332
DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S WINTER

02:12:53.398 --> 02:12:55.033
OR SUMMER. WE DON'T HAVE THE

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:57.035
INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO IT EITHER.

02:12:57.102 --> 02:12:58.036
SO WE'RE WE'RE NOT USING

02:12:58.103 --> 02:12:59.905
TECHNOLOGY THE WHOLE POINT OF.

02:12:59.971 --> 02:13:01.239
THE WAY THAT THIS PROPOSALS

02:13:01.306 --> 02:13:04.509
WRITTEN IT'S MEANT TO BE IN

02:13:04.576 --> 02:13:05.777
PERSON WE'VE SEEN. WELL WHAT

02:13:05.844 --> 02:13:07.279
DISTANCE LEARNING DOES. AND SO

02:13:07.346 --> 02:13:09.981
WE ARE RICH. THE ABILITY TO

02:13:10.048 --> 02:13:12.117
DISTANCE LEARN IT IS MEANT FOR

02:13:12.184 --> 02:13:13.585
IN PERSON THE MAJORITY LARGE

02:13:13.652 --> 02:13:15.787
MAJORITY OF IT IS MEANT FOR. IN

02:13:15.854 --> 02:13:18.790

02:13:21.593 --> 02:13:23.562
THE FLOOR AROUND IN PERSON.

02:13:23.628 --> 02:13:24.696
CONSTRUCTION WORK YOU KNOW

02:13:24.763 --> 02:13:26.398
THAT'S NEVER BEEN A DEBATE.

02:13:26.465 --> 02:13:27.833
THAT'S BECAUSE THE COLDER THAT

02:13:27.899 --> 02:13:30.936
WE ALLOWED. TO HAVE DISTANCE

02:13:31.002 --> 02:13:32.371
LEARNING BUT IF IT WERE NOT

02:13:32.437 --> 02:13:33.338
COLD AND WE WERE WITH HIM THERE

02:13:33.405 --> 02:13:36.208

SUPERINTENDENTS BELIEVE WE ALL

02:13:42.414 --> 02:13:44.850

THIS MONIES. IS GO BACK TO IN

02:13:46.752 --> 02:13:51.523

OF IT SYSTEMS NOT BEING ABLE TO

02:17:12.958 --> 02:17:14.626

AS IMPORTANT AS THE EDUCATION

02:17:37.983 --> 02:17:40.719

02:17:48.727 --> 02:17:50.061
ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND IS

02:17:50.128 --> 02:17:51.930
HEAVILY IMPACTED. WHEN

02:17:51.997 --> 02:17:53.064

02:18:06.811 --> 02:18:09.047
BIG PART OF THE ENTERTAINMENT-

02:18:09.114 --> 02:18:10.782
IS I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

02:18:10.849 --> 02:18:11.950
FOR THESE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE

02:18:12.017 --> 02:18:16.287
BEEN SUFFERING AND- IT'S ONE

02:18:16.354 --> 02:18:17.589
THING FOR PROSPECTIVELY TO

02:18:17.656 --> 02:18:20.191

WE DONE ENOUGH. TO RESEARCH TO

02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:23.862
UNDERSTAND WHAT EXACTLY HOW

02:18:23.928 --> 02:18:26.164
MUCH IS THE AMOUNT. THAT FOR

02:18:26.231 --> 02:18:28.033
LAST YEAR THESE BUSINESSES WERE

02:18:28.099 --> 02:18:30.402
SETBACK. FOR THE ENTIRE STATE

02:18:39.411 --> 02:18:42.547
RESTAURANTS LOST IN TERMS OF.

02:18:42.614 --> 02:18:43.948
HOW MUCH REVENUE THEY LOST AS A

02:18:44.015 --> 02:18:45.650
RESULT NO I'M SORRY I GUESS I

02:18:45.717 --> 02:18:47.686
DIDN'T ASK IT. SIMPLY ENOUGH

02:18:47.752 --> 02:18:49.554
WHAT IS THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE

02:18:49.621 --> 02:18:53.758
GENERATED BY THE STATE BY THESE

02:18:53.825 --> 02:18:55.026
LICENSES. FOR LAST YEAR. IT'S

02:18:55.093 --> 02:18:56.561
ROUGHLY FORTY FIVE MILLION

02:18:56.628 --> 02:18:58.730
DOLLARS ANNUALLY OKAY. AND IF

02:18:58.797 --> 02:19:01.232
WE HAVE A RECORD OF WHO'S PAID.

02:19:01.299 --> 02:19:01.833
I UNDERSTAND THE TIMING OF IT

02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:04.869
ME. GIVEN THE- CONTINUOUS

02:19:04.936 --> 02:19:06.404
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE WHEN IT

02:19:06.471 --> 02:19:09.140
COMES TO I. T. I CAN UNDERSTAND

02:19:09.207 --> 02:19:11.242
THAT WE MAY NEED TO DELAY

02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:14.245
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS. BUT WHY

02:19:14.312 --> 02:19:17.048
NOT AT LEAST LOOK AT. EVEN IF

02:19:17.115 --> 02:19:19.317
IT'S NOT REFUNDING BY GIVING

02:19:19.384 --> 02:19:21.853
THEM CREDIT TOWARDS SOME OF

02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:23.121
THEM HAVE LOST THEIR BUSINESS

02:19:23.188 --> 02:19:25.323
COMPLETELY MAY WANT TO PUT SOME

02:19:25.390 --> 02:19:26.991
MONEY ASIDE AND FIGURE OUT

02:19:27.058 --> 02:19:28.259
OPENING UP SOMETHING IN THE

02:19:28.326 --> 02:19:30.628
NEXT TWO YEARS YOUR TO WHY NOT

02:19:30.695 --> 02:19:32.363
GIVE THOSE BUSINESSES THE

02:19:32.430 --> 02:19:34.532
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CREDIT.

02:19:34.599 --> 02:19:36.234
TO NOT. INCUR AN ADDITIONAL

02:19:36.301 --> 02:19:40.572
COST- FOR ALL FOR ALL THE BRICK

02:19:40.638 --> 02:19:41.706
AND MORTAR COST THAT THEY'RE

02:19:41.773 --> 02:19:43.508
GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHEN

02:19:43.575 --> 02:19:45.343
SETTING UP A NEW BUSINESS. SO

02:19:45.410 --> 02:19:46.578
I'M I'M I'M ASKING THAT FOR

02:19:46.644 --> 02:19:47.979
BOTH BUSINESSES WERE PERSONALLY

02:19:48.046 --> 02:19:49.714
SHUT DOWN BUT ALSO BUSINESSES

02:19:49.781 --> 02:19:51.683
THAT STRUGGLING BY NOW AND

02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:52.917
LITTLE BIT OF AN INJECTION

02:19:52.984 --> 02:19:54.486
MONEY. OR CREDIT TOWARDS A

02:19:54.552 --> 02:19:56.387
FUTURE YEAR WOULD WOULD GO A

02:19:56.454 --> 02:20:01.426
LONG WAY. AND WHAT I DO THINK

02:20:01.493 --> 02:20:03.128
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

02:20:03.194 --> 02:20:04.062
WE HADN'T WITH ALLEGE OF WHAT

02:20:04.129 --> 02:20:06.231
THE LEGISLATURE AGREED TO

02:20:06.297 --> 02:20:07.565
PROVIDING TWO YEARS OF REALLY

02:20:07.632 --> 02:20:08.800
FOR THESE BUSINESSES RATHER

02:20:08.867 --> 02:20:09.968
THAN JUST THE ONE THAT WE HAD A

02:20:10.034 --> 02:20:13.037
PROPOSED IN JANUARY- SO THAT IS

02:20:13.104 --> 02:20:13.905
ONE ELEMENT RIVER TRYING TO

02:20:13.972 --> 02:20:16.441
ADDRESS IT. I'M I ALSO THERE'S

02:20:16.508 --> 02:20:18.643
STOP RESOURCES AND COSTS TO THE

02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:20.779
STATE ALSO OF REFUNDING THOSE.

02:20:20.845 --> 02:20:22.447
THOSE I FEES THAT WERE PAID

02:20:22.514 --> 02:20:24.516
PREVIOUSLY BUT AT THE END OF

02:20:24.582 --> 02:20:25.517
THE DAY WERE REALLY JUST TRYING

02:20:25.583 --> 02:20:27.218
TO PROVIDE PERSPECTIVE REALLY

02:20:27.285 --> 02:20:28.286
FOR THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ARE

02:20:28.353 --> 02:20:29.954
STILL IN OPERATION I'M SORRY

02:20:30.021 --> 02:20:31.055

LET ME INTERRUPT YOU I DON'T%

02:20:32.323 --> 02:20:35.593
FIND THAT ARGUMENT BEING. VERY

02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:36.961
THE BEST ARGUMENT TO USE THAT

02:20:37.028 --> 02:20:38.096
IT'S GOING TO TAKE STAFF TIME

02:20:38.163 --> 02:20:40.064
TO REFINE FOLKS. THAT HAVE

02:20:40.131 --> 02:20:42.967

02:20:45.603 --> 02:20:49.641
COLLEAGUES. FIND THAT TO BE A

02:20:49.707 --> 02:20:50.208
VERY GOOD ARGUMENT I DON'T-

02:20:50.275 --> 02:20:51.776
EXPECT. FACT ME READ THIS AGAIN

WE ARE VOTING ON. TODAY AS WELL

02:23:18.957 --> 02:23:20.425
AS THE RETURN TO IN PERSON

02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:22.560
INSTRUCTION I THINK IT WARRANTS

02:23:22.627 --> 02:23:26.064
ARE. OUR INTERROGATION OF THE

02:23:26.130 --> 02:23:27.598
PLANET WARRANTS ARE CRITICISMS

02:23:27.665 --> 02:23:29.233
OR WARTS ARE- CRITIQUE OF THE

02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:31.402
PLAN BECAUSE IF WE DO MOVE BACK

02:23:31.469 --> 02:23:33.137
TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IT

02:23:33.204 --> 02:23:34.472
WILL BE A SINGLE MOST DRAMATIC

02:23:34.539 --> 02:23:36.474
COVED ADAPTATION WE'VE HAD.

02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:38.176
THIS WHOLE OVER TIME WE ARE

02:23:38.242 --> 02:23:40.645
APPROACHING ONE YEAR OF THE

02:23:40.712 --> 02:23:41.779
COVER TIMES AND AT LEAST THIS

02:23:41.846 --> 02:23:42.847
COUNTRY AND IT'S IMPORTANT

02:23:42.914 --> 02:23:45.149
MEMBER AS I HEAR A LOT OF GREAT

02:23:45.216 --> 02:23:46.884
COMMENTS- REMEMBERING THAT

02:23:46.951 --> 02:23:48.319
THERE IS A GREAT TRAUMA TO OUR

02:23:48.386 --> 02:23:49.120
YOUNG PEOPLE TO OUR STUDENTS

02:23:49.187 --> 02:23:50.855
RIGHT NOW. IS THAT THE VIRUS

02:23:50.922 --> 02:23:51.956
THAT STILL RAGES IN THIS

02:23:52.023 --> 02:23:53.825
COUNTRY. AT PERHAPS

02:23:53.891 --> 02:23:54.993
EMBARRASSMENT TO THE DEBT THE

02:23:55.059 --> 02:23:56.227
END TO THE ENTIRE DEVELOP THE

02:23:56.294 --> 02:23:58.062
WORLD IN THIS COUNTRY. IS THE

02:23:58.129 --> 02:23:59.364
CAUSE OF ALL OF THAT THAT IS

02:23:59.430 --> 02:24:01.032
THE REASON WHY WE MUST REMAIN

02:24:01.099 --> 02:24:02.634
VIGILANT ABOUT IT WHY WE HAVE

02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:03.935
HYBRIDISE SUCTION WIFE TO

02:24:04.002 --> 02:24:05.737
COURTS. AND MY FRANKLY LIKE

02:24:05.803 --> 02:24:08.373
YOUNG PEOPLE MIGHT BE. IN THREE

02:24:08.439 --> 02:24:09.807
MONTHS GRADUATING INTO AN

02:24:09.874 --> 02:24:10.742
ECONOMY THAT HAS NO JOB

02:24:10.808 --> 02:24:12.343
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM THAT HAS

02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:13.211
MADE SO THEY COULDN'T SEE THE

02:24:13.277 --> 02:24:13.978
ELDER RELATIVES WHO PASSED

02:24:14.045 --> 02:24:15.880
AWAY. AND PERHAPS EVEN LESS

02:24:15.947 --> 02:24:17.415
OPPORTUNITY THAN EVEN THE

02:24:17.482 --> 02:24:18.683
GENERATION MY GRADUATE

02:24:18.750 --> 02:24:19.617
GENERATION HAD EVEN LESS THAN

02:24:19.684 --> 02:24:21.619
THAT BEFORE. SO IT'S IMPORTANT

02:24:21.686 --> 02:24:23.621
TO REMEMBER THAT WHILE WE MUST

02:24:23.688 --> 02:24:24.655
FIGHT FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION

02:24:24.722 --> 02:24:26.290
RETURN TO THAT SENSE OF

02:24:26.357 --> 02:24:28.259
NORMALCY. IT WILL NOT SHORT.

02:24:28.326 --> 02:24:29.627
UNTIL WE DEFEAT THE VIRUS IT

02:24:29.694 --> 02:24:30.995
WILL NOT CURE ALL THOSE

02:24:31.062 --> 02:24:32.563
ELEMENTS OF THOSE PROBLEMS ARE

02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:34.565
EXISTING UNTIL WE- UNTIL WE

02:24:34.632 --> 02:24:35.833
COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESSED THE

02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:37.201
VIRUS. AND ALL ITS IMPACTS

02:24:37.268 --> 02:24:38.036
THAT'S WHY I'M REALLY GLAD

02:24:38.102 --> 02:24:39.771
WE'RE VOTING TODAY AT LEAST ON

02:24:39.837 --> 02:24:41.606
THE BIG PACKAGE OF STIMULUS.

02:24:41.672 --> 02:24:43.007
DIRECT PAYMENTS TO WORKING

02:24:43.074 --> 02:24:44.208

02:24:48.246 --> 02:24:49.881
DOLLARS JUST TO WORKING CLASS

02:24:49.947 --> 02:24:51.349

02:24:54.052 --> 02:24:54.519
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WILL

EVAPORATE IN COMMERCIAL RENT

02:24:56.120 --> 02:25:01.192
AND LESS THAN THAT. WELL IT'S

02:25:01.259 --> 02:25:01.859
IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT ONE TIME.

02:25:01.926 --> 02:25:03.094
RELIEF IT'S STILL RELIEF BUT WE

02:25:03.161 --> 02:25:04.028
NEED TO BE DOING HOPEFUL THE

ON THE STATE'S WORKING- EARLY

02:25:12.904 --> 02:25:15.206
ACTION. WHAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

02:25:15.273 --> 02:25:16.808
IS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SCHOOL

02:25:16.874 --> 02:25:18.276
RE OPENING AS I'VE EXPRESSED

02:25:18.342 --> 02:25:19.544
BEFORE AS WE SHOULD NOT BE

02:25:19.610 --> 02:25:20.478
MOTIVATED BY AN ARBITRARY

02:25:20.545 --> 02:25:22.447
CALENDAR IN THE DAY. YES IT'S

02:25:22.513 --> 02:25:24.215

WAIT THE MORE MORE TIME WILL BE

02:25:26.918 --> 02:25:28.453
WASTED. BUT I'M REMINDED THAT

02:25:28.519 --> 02:25:30.321
EVEN IN MY DISTRICT IN FREMONT

02:25:30.388 --> 02:25:31.522
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT LAST

02:25:31.589 --> 02:25:33.591
WEEK THERE WAS A- SURVEY

02:25:33.658 --> 02:25:35.026
RELEASED OF TEN THOUSAND

02:25:35.093 --> 02:25:37.095
PARENTS AND 63% OF THEM SAID

02:25:37.161 --> 02:25:38.896
THEY DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE.

02:25:38.963 --> 02:25:39.997
PUTTING US IN A BACK IN IN

02:25:40.064 --> 02:25:41.232
PERSON TRACTION THAT'S OKAY.

02:25:41.299 --> 02:25:42.467
THAT'S A CHOICE RATES AT LEAST

02:25:42.533 --> 02:25:44.302
40% CAN HAVE THAT OPTION. BUT

02:25:44.368 --> 02:25:45.436
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE IT

02:25:45.503 --> 02:25:47.271
A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. PUBLICLY

02:25:47.338 --> 02:25:48.706
HEALTH SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR

02:25:48.773 --> 02:25:49.774
STUDENTS OUR FAMILIES AND OUR

02:25:49.841 --> 02:25:51.576
EDUCATORS OF COURSE. I'M AND OF

02:25:51.642 --> 02:25:52.443
COURSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:53.511
FAIR CRITICISM I THINK OF THE

02:25:53.578 --> 02:25:54.812
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT ITS ROLE

02:25:54.879 --> 02:25:57.081
IN THE VACCINES. AND HOW THEIR

02:25:57.148 --> 02:25:58.049
SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN

02:25:58.116 --> 02:26:00.218
ASKING FOR A PLANNED SINCE LAST

02:26:00.284 --> 02:26:01.986
YEAR WHEN THIS VIRUS BEGAN.

02:26:02.053 --> 02:26:04.755
WHAT WOULD THE PLAN BE WHAT

02:26:04.822 --> 02:26:05.356
WOULD THE STATE WIDE STANDARD

02:26:05.423 --> 02:26:06.991
B. AND I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING

02:26:07.058 --> 02:26:09.193
SO UNITED. THE UNITED THAT

02:26:09.260 --> 02:26:10.862
UNITES THE GOVERNOR. THE SENATE

02:26:10.928 --> 02:26:12.096
AND ASSEMBLY LEADERSHIP IN

02:26:12.163 --> 02:26:12.997
MAKING SURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS

02:26:13.064 --> 02:26:14.999
ARE OPEN SAFELY AGAIN. SO I'M

02:26:15.066 --> 02:26:17.702
WONDERING. COULD THIS IS A

02:26:17.768 --> 02:26:18.302
QUESTION I THINK IT'S FOR OUR

02:26:18.369 --> 02:26:20.404
COMMITTEE. COULD WE PUT IN THE

02:26:20.471 --> 02:26:23.307

NOT SINCE WE HAVE. THE URGENCY

02:26:37.855 --> 02:26:39.123
AND THE DRIVE TO MAKE SURE OUR

02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:40.224
STUDENTS GET BACK TO THE

02:26:40.291 --> 02:26:42.627
CLASSROOM. TO PRIORITIZE BYLAWS

02:26:42.693 --> 02:26:44.629

THERE'S A HUGE DISPARITY HERE.

02:27:48.192 --> 02:27:50.861
AND WHAT REALLY CONCERNS ME IN

02:27:50.928 --> 02:27:53.297
WHAT IS OFTEN MISSED. WHEN

02:27:53.364 --> 02:27:54.298
DISCUSSING OUR SMALL RURAL

02:27:54.365 --> 02:27:56.867
SCHOOLS IT IS THE FACT THAT

02:27:56.934 --> 02:27:58.236
THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:27:58.302 --> 02:28:00.438
ADMINISTRATIVE ABILITIES TO DO

02:28:00.504 --> 02:28:03.474
ALL OF THESE THINGS. SO WHAT

02:28:03.541 --> 02:28:04.508

ALREADY BROUGHT ONLINE SO THAT.

02:28:19.557 --> 02:28:20.658
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

02:28:20.725 --> 02:28:23.227
HAS BROUGHT AT PEDIATRIC HEALTH

02:28:23.294 --> 02:28:25.763
AND SCHOOL BASED SAFETY EXPERTS

02:28:25.830 --> 02:28:27.665

A TRAUMA. INFORMED ENVIRONMENT

02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:52.056
SO HOW DO YOU ADDRESS LEARNING

02:28:52.123 --> 02:28:53.724

SCIENCE AND BASED OFF OF BEST

02:29:01.732 --> 02:29:03.134
PRACTICES THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:04.735
ARE NOT RECREATING THE WHEEL.

02:29:04.802 --> 02:29:06.137
AND ISOLATION SO THAT TECHNICAL

02:29:06.203 --> 02:29:08.306
ASSISTANCE UNDER SB EIGHTY SIX

02:29:08.372 --> 02:29:10.975
WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ALL SCHOOL

02:29:11.042 --> 02:29:11.909
DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. I

02:29:11.976 --> 02:29:13.044
UNDERSTANDABLE BUT TO DOCTOR

02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:14.679
WOODS POINT HI HOW ARE THEY

02:29:14.745 --> 02:29:17.848
GOING TO GET OUT THERE. I HAVE

02:29:17.915 --> 02:29:19.650
I HAVE AREAS IN MY DISTRICT.

02:29:19.717 --> 02:29:23.387
THAT MY I'VE GOT SCHOOLS THAT

02:29:23.454 --> 02:29:25.956
ARE TWO HOURS AWAY FROM COUNTY

02:29:26.023 --> 02:29:28.159
CENTERS SUMMER THREE FOUR HOURS

02:29:28.225 --> 02:29:33.397
AWAY. THEY DON'T HAVE. INTERNET

02:29:33.464 --> 02:29:35.199
SERVICE THEIR FAMILIES DON'T

02:29:35.266 --> 02:29:38.369
HAVE INTERNET SERVICE SO WHAT

02:29:38.436 --> 02:29:40.037
IS THE ACTUAL PLAN. TO REACH

02:29:40.104 --> 02:29:43.708
THE I HAVE AREAS THAT LIKE DR

02:29:43.774 --> 02:29:49.146
WOODS. WHO ARE DEALING WITH.

02:29:49.213 --> 02:29:52.650
MUDSLIDES LANDSLIDES SNOW IN

02:29:52.717 --> 02:29:54.585
ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT IT OTHER

02:29:54.652 --> 02:29:58.289
SITUATIONS. STILL RECOVERING

02:29:58.356 --> 02:30:02.259
FROM WILDFIRES SITUATIONS. WHO

02:30:02.326 --> 02:30:04.161
CANNOT BE REACHED EASILY THESE

02:30:04.228 --> 02:30:07.365
ARE VERY ISOLATED COMMUNITIES

02:30:07.431 --> 02:30:08.766
WHO ARE STRUGGLING AND NEED

02:30:08.833 --> 02:30:10.334
HELP IN THEIR KIDS DESERVE TO

02:30:10.401 --> 02:30:12.870
GO BACK TO SCHOOLS WHILE.

02:30:12.937 --> 02:30:14.138
BECAUSE THE DISTANCE LEARNING

02:30:14.205 --> 02:30:15.539
DOESN'T WORK FOR THEM BECAUSE

02:30:15.606 --> 02:30:17.108
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT INTERNET

02:30:17.174 --> 02:30:20.077
ACCESS. SO THEIR FAMILIES ARE

02:30:20.144 --> 02:30:23.414
HAVING TO DRIVE. IN OUR TO A

02:30:23.481 --> 02:30:25.716
SCHOOL TO GO PICK UP A PACKET

02:30:25.783 --> 02:30:28.152
SO THEIR KIDS CAN LEARN IN

02:30:28.219 --> 02:30:30.921
THERE DOING THIS. IN AND I KNOW

02:30:30.988 --> 02:30:34.859
THIS FIRST HAND. I WENT TO

02:30:34.925 --> 02:30:37.328
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. IN A THREE

02:30:37.395 --> 02:30:39.296
CLASSROOM SCHOOL THAT WAS K.

02:30:39.363 --> 02:30:43.334
THROUGH SIX. OUR PRINCIPAL WAS

02:30:43.401 --> 02:30:43.934
ALSO THE FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE

02:30:44.001 --> 02:30:46.337
TEACHER. WHO ALSO DID ALL THE

02:30:46.404 --> 02:30:48.706
ADMINISTRATIVE WORK- ALSO DROVE

02:30:48.773 --> 02:30:52.476
ONE OF THE BUS ROUTES. THESE

02:30:52.543 --> 02:30:57.481
PEOPLE WEAR MULTIPLE HATS. AND

02:30:57.548 --> 02:30:59.717
I KNOW A MAJORITY OF OUR

02:30:59.784 --> 02:31:00.818
LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS DON'T

02:31:00.885 --> 02:31:02.686
UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE WE

02:31:02.753 --> 02:31:03.921
THEY'VE YET ANOTHER RIVER TO

02:31:03.988 --> 02:31:05.756
LIVE DID OR NEVER EXPERIENCED

02:31:05.823 --> 02:31:09.326
OR NEVER SEEN IT. THESE PEOPLE

02:31:09.393 --> 02:31:11.362
SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE TIME. OF

02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:15.666
THE DAY. TO PUT ALL OF THESE

02:31:15.733 --> 02:31:19.503
THINGS TOGETHER. TO DO THIS SO

02:31:19.570 --> 02:31:20.704
TO SAY YES THERE'S GOING TO BE

02:31:20.771 --> 02:31:23.707
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THAT

02:31:23.774 --> 02:31:26.143
THAT'S GREAT TO SAY IT. BUT

02:31:26.210 --> 02:31:27.778
WHO'S ACTUALLY GONNA SHOW UP

02:31:27.845 --> 02:31:31.015
AND HELP THEM DO THIS. BECAUSE

02:31:31.081 --> 02:31:38.789
THAT. IS AN EQUITY ISSUE.

02:31:38.856 --> 02:31:41.692
BECAUSE THEY DESERVE IT TOO.

02:31:41.759 --> 02:31:44.628
AND I DON'T SEE THAT IN HERE

02:31:44.695 --> 02:31:46.197
WHICH IS WHY I'VE GOTTEN A

02:31:46.263 --> 02:31:46.764
PHONE CALL THAT I'VE GOT AND

02:31:46.831 --> 02:31:48.933
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THESE THESE

02:31:48.999 --> 02:31:52.636
GIANT NASCAR. FIRELESS FROM ALL

02:31:52.703 --> 02:31:55.139

02:32:02.413 --> 02:32:03.481
TALK ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH

02:32:03.547 --> 02:32:04.648
ISSUES WE CAN TALK ABOUT ALL OF

02:32:04.715 --> 02:32:06.984
THE OTHER THINGS BUT WE HAVE TO

02:32:07.051 --> 02:32:10.054
PROVIDE THE RESOURCES. IN AN

02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:14.525
EQUITABLE WAY. SO IT'S FAIR

02:32:14.592 --> 02:32:16.760
WHAT A LOT OF YOU CONSIDER

02:32:16.827 --> 02:32:19.997
SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE THE

02:32:20.064 --> 02:32:20.598
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND MY LARGER

02:32:20.664 --> 02:32:24.835
CITIES. MOST OF MY SCHOOL-

02:32:24.902 --> 02:32:28.005
LITTLE COUNTY IRELAND SCHOOLS.

02:32:28.072 --> 02:32:29.039
SOME OF THEM STILL HAVE BEEN

02:32:29.106 --> 02:32:32.076
POSSIBLE WATER. WE HAVE ALL

02:32:32.142 --> 02:32:32.710
THESE ISSUES THEY STILL HAVEN'T

02:32:32.776 --> 02:32:37.348

HERE AND SAY HEY WE'RE GONNA

02:32:46.423 --> 02:32:48.392
THROW TWO BILLION DOLLARS AT IT.

02:32:48.459 --> 02:32:49.493

02:32:51.095 --> 02:32:52.796
SEVEN YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE. WE

LICENSES AND ABC LICENSES

02:35:09.667 --> 02:35:12.336
BECAUSE OUR COMPUTER SYSTEM

THEY THEY HAVE I. T. ISSUES.

02:35:15.339 --> 02:35:16.674

02:35:47.438 --> 02:35:50.174
CAN GO INTO THE DMV WEBSITE

02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:52.142

LET ME JUST. OFFER A LITTLE

02:36:38.555 --> 02:36:40.691
CONTEXT- MANY OF THE SYSTEMS

02:36:40.758 --> 02:36:42.559
THAT THE STATE USES FOR A LOT

02:36:42.626 --> 02:36:43.727
OF VERY COMPLICATED PROGRAMS

02:36:43.794 --> 02:36:45.763
WERE BUILT. TWENTY THIRTY YEARS

02:36:45.829 --> 02:36:49.299
AGO- AND THERE THESE PROGRAMS

02:36:49.366 --> 02:36:51.168
ARE VERY COMPLEX AND ANY TIME

02:36:51.235 --> 02:36:54.371
CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE- THE

02:36:54.438 --> 02:36:56.406
SYSTEMS NEED TO BE RE

02:36:56.473 --> 02:36:58.242
PROGRAMMED SO SIMPLY THAT TAKES

02:36:58.308 --> 02:37:01.245

SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT

02:37:09.653 --> 02:37:10.954
BUILDING THESE COMPUTER SYSTEMS

02:37:11.021 --> 02:37:12.422
GOING FORWARD BUT THE CURRENT

02:37:12.489 --> 02:37:14.558
SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE MANY OF

02:37:14.625 --> 02:37:15.092

CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE

02:40:05.796 --> 02:40:06.997
ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT PROMISES

02:40:07.064 --> 02:40:09.032

02:48:04.607 --> 02:48:05.975
OPENING SCHOOLS ISSUE SINCE.

02:48:06.042 --> 02:48:08.244
NOVEMBER I THINK IT IS A LITTLE

02:48:08.311 --> 02:48:09.946
BIT IRONIC WHEN I HAVE

02:48:10.013 --> 02:48:11.815
DISTRICTS. ASKING FOR

02:48:11.881 --> 02:48:14.717
FLEXIBILITY I CAN THINK OF NO

02:48:14.784 --> 02:48:18.054
MORE REGULATED- SUBJECT MATTER

02:48:18.121 --> 02:48:20.156
THAN THE EDUCATION FIELD. DOWN

02:48:20.223 --> 02:48:21.491
TO THE HOUR IS DOWN TO THE

02:48:21.558 --> 02:48:22.826
CURRICULA AND DOWN TO THE

02:48:22.892 --> 02:48:24.894
COURSES DOWN TO THE GRAZED DOWN

02:48:24.961 --> 02:48:26.596
TO THE AGES. FRANKLY DOWN TO

02:48:26.663 --> 02:48:28.097
THE ATTENDANCE AGAIN JUST

02:48:28.164 --> 02:48:29.699
REMINDER ATTENDANCE IN SCHOOL

02:48:29.766 --> 02:48:32.268
IS NOT FLEXIBLE- THERE'S ALMOST

02:48:32.335 --> 02:48:34.504
NOTHING THAT IS FLEXIBLE. IN

02:48:34.571 --> 02:48:36.573
EDUCATION- WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN

02:48:36.639 --> 02:48:38.441
THE PAST WAS MOVE TOWARD OUR

02:48:38.508 --> 02:48:40.210
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA.

02:48:40.276 --> 02:48:41.945
IN AN ATTEMPT TO GIVE DISTRICTS

02:48:42.011 --> 02:48:43.947
ARE GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN TO A

02:48:44.013 --> 02:48:46.015
LARGE EXTENT IT HAS WORKED.

02:48:46.082 --> 02:48:49.018
VOCAL FLEXIBILITY. IN TERMS OF

02:48:49.085 --> 02:48:51.454
ENSURING THAT LOCAL ISTRICTS.

02:48:51.521 --> 02:48:52.522
COULD ADAPT TO THEIR

02:48:52.589 --> 02:48:54.224
ENVIRONMENT TO THEIR STUDENTS

02:48:54.290 --> 02:48:56.860
OVERALL I BELIEVE WAS THE RIGHT

02:48:56.926 --> 02:48:59.429
DECISION. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS

02:48:59.496 --> 02:49:01.698
THAT. IN A PUBLIC HEALTH

02:49:01.764 --> 02:49:03.633
PANDEMIC THAT HAS TOUCHED EVERY

02:49:03.700 --> 02:49:07.370
SINGLE CORNER OF THE STATE- NOT

02:49:07.437 --> 02:49:09.539
EQUALLY BUT AS DEFTLY TOUCHED

02:49:09.606 --> 02:49:10.273
EVERY SINGLE CORNER OF THE

02:49:10.340 --> 02:49:13.610
STATE. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR

02:49:13.676 --> 02:49:15.478
OVER A THOUSAND DISTRICTS TO

02:49:15.545 --> 02:49:17.080
COME UP WITH A THOUSAND

02:49:17.146 --> 02:49:19.148
DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS. AND WHAT

02:49:19.215 --> 02:49:20.483
WE HAD HOPED IS WHEN WE DID

02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:23.353
THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. IS BY

02:49:23.419 --> 02:49:26.089
REALLY REALLY FORCEFULLY

02:49:26.155 --> 02:49:28.391
ENCOURAGING EVERYBODY TO BE.

02:49:28.458 --> 02:49:30.293
MOVING TO IN PERSON LEARNING

02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:33.096
WHAT IT WAS POSSIBLE- AND AS WE

02:49:33.162 --> 02:49:34.931
SAW CASE RATES REALLY DROPPED

02:49:34.998 --> 02:49:37.567
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FALL AND

02:49:37.634 --> 02:49:39.702
SCHOOLS STARTED. WE

02:49:39.769 --> 02:49:40.570
UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T SEE

02:49:40.637 --> 02:49:43.306
DISTRICTS REALLY PREPARE FOR

02:49:43.373 --> 02:49:44.307
OPENING UP SCHOOLS WHICH WOULD

02:49:44.374 --> 02:49:45.975
HAVE BEEN THE BEST TIME. OF MY

02:49:46.042 --> 02:49:47.243
COUNTY HAD ONE OF THE LOWEST

02:49:47.310 --> 02:49:48.211
CASE RATES IN THE STATE WE

02:49:48.278 --> 02:49:52.949
ACTUALLY REACHED. THE- SORT OF

02:49:53.016 --> 02:49:54.951
ON IT DOUBLE YELLOW TIER

02:49:55.018 --> 02:49:56.953
HOWEVER. NOTE AROUND SCHOOL

02:49:57.020 --> 02:49:58.588
REAL. NO DISCUSS AROUND HOW TO

02:49:58.655 --> 02:49:59.722
GET Q. BACK THOUGH WE HIT

02:49:59.789 --> 02:50:03.760
YELLOW FOR. SO I THINK WE ARE

02:50:03.826 --> 02:50:04.394
NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT'S

02:50:04.460 --> 02:50:05.461
MISTAKE WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE

02:50:05.528 --> 02:50:07.764
GIVING MONEY TO DISTRICTS. TO

02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:09.899
ALLOW THEM THE CHOICE OF

02:50:09.966 --> 02:50:13.036
WHETHER TO OPEN UP OR NOT. THE

02:50:13.102 --> 02:50:15.171
MONEY IS TRUE IS FOR RE

02:50:15.238 --> 02:50:17.941
OPENING- AS YOU ALL SEE THE ONE

02:50:18.007 --> 02:50:19.309
THING WE'VE ALL AGREED ON IS WE

02:50:19.375 --> 02:50:21.210
WANT SCHOOLS TO RE OPEN UP

02:50:21.277 --> 02:50:22.712
THERE'S BEEN NO DISAGREEMENT.

02:50:22.779 --> 02:50:24.814
AROUND THAT IN THIS BODY TODAY

02:50:24.881 --> 02:50:26.316
REALLY IS ABOUT HOW WE DO IT

02:50:26.382 --> 02:50:28.318
AND HOW WE SUPPORT SCHOOLS IN

02:50:28.384 --> 02:50:30.520
DOING IT- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE

02:50:30.587 --> 02:50:33.423
SURE. THAT WE GET SCHOOLS OPEN

02:50:33.489 --> 02:50:36.626
UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

02:50:36.693 --> 02:50:38.995
UNFORTUNATELY LETTING DISTRICTS

02:50:39.062 --> 02:50:40.530
DO IT ON THEIR OWN IN THEIR OWN

02:50:40.597 --> 02:50:42.999
TIME FRAME HAS NOT WORKED. IT

02:50:43.066 --> 02:50:45.168
HASN'T WORKED IN THE MOST

02:50:45.234 --> 02:50:46.235

WORKED IN OUR LARGEST

02:50:47.236 --> 02:50:49.439

02:50:49.505 --> 02:50:51.474
