PROCESS ANNUAL APPLICATIONS OR UNTIL SEPTEMBER TWO FIFTEENTH TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN WHICHEVER IS SOONER. THE TEMPORARY LICENSE PROGRAM WHICH WAS ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS ESTABLISHED TO ALLOW CANNABIS. BUSINESSES TO OPERATE WHILE STATE LICENSING AGENCIES DEVELOP PROCESS AND REVIEW APPLICATIONS FOR ANNUAL LICENSES LAST YEAR WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE TEMPORARY. STRUCTURE WOULD EXPIRE BEFORE ALL OF THE ANNUAL APPLICATIONS WERE REVIEWED ADDITIONAL PROVISIONAL LICENSE CATEGORY WAS CREATED TO SB. FIVE FOURTEEN FIFTY NINE UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE THE CREATION OF THE PROVISIONAL LICENSES THOUSANDS OF APPLICANTS WITH CORRESPONDING ANNUAL APPLICATIONS HAVE HAD THEIR TEMPORARY LICENSES EXPIRE WHILE THEIR APPLICATIONS ARE PENDING REVIEW.

AND WE WILL OPEN THE HEARING. ON A FAIR AND EMERGENCY SERVICES. US SO THANK YOU EVERYBODY VERY MUCH FOR COMING TODAY FOR THIS HEARING AS WE KNOW WE HAVE SEEN MORE AND MORE OF OUR FAIRGROUNDS BEING USED FOR EMERGENCY SITUATIONS FOR STAGING. FOR A WHILE FIRES BOTH FOR HOUSING FOR HUMANS AS WELL AS FOR ANIMALS AS WELL AS FOR EQUIPMENT -- IN THE LAST DECADE THERE HAVE BEEN COUNTLESS NUMBERS OF OF INCIDENTS AND SO WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE DO IT BEST -- HOW DO WE BEST USE OUR RESOURCES SO WE ARE VERY PLEASED TODAY TO HAVE WITH US THREE PANELS -- WHO ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH -- KIND OF OVER VIEWS OF FAIR AND THE FEARS ROLE DURING DISASTERS OUR SECOND PANEL WILL DISCUSS USED AS A STAGING AREA EMERGENCY SHELTER FOR ANIMALS PEOPLE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WITH THE INFLUX ON THE FAIRGROUNDS. AND THE PANEL THREE WILL BE HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD TO ENSURE FAIRS CAN CONTINUE. TO BE STRONG PARTNERS WITH LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL EMERGENCIES. SERVICES DURING THESE DISASTERS -- SO ON OUR FIRST ONE WE HAVE KEVIN. MASS MATTHEW HARPER. ARE YES THAT MEASURE HOW CAN CAUSE GHOST AT WOULD DEPUTY SECRETARY MINISTRATION OF FINANCE OF CDFA. AND MITCH MEDICAL WHICH GIVE IT WILL GIVE EACH DEVRY DIRECTOR OF LOGISTICS -- FOR YES -- THANK YOU GERMAN VERY MUCH ANNA PLEASE FORESHORES. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- WERE ACTUALLY ALWAYS PLEASED TO GET THIS KIND OF ATTENTION TOWARDS OUR FAIRGROUNDS BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY VALUABLE ASSETS. AND THEY HAVE HAD STRUGGLES IN RECENT YEARS AND I'M NOT GOING TO BORE YOU GUYS ALL WITH A LOT OF HISTORY ABOUT THAT BUT THERE'S BEEN FUNDING SHIFTS THAT HISTORICALLY THEY WERE FUNDED THROUGH HORSE RACING ACTIVITIES AND THEN THAT WENT AWAY. FOR ABOUT TWO OR THREE FISCAL YEARS THERE WAS A GENERAL FUND SUPPORT IN AND ALL THE SUDDEN THAT GOT PULLED AWAY AND ESSENTIALLY VERY QUICKLY AND WITHOUT MUCH NOTICE. AND SAT CREATED A LOT OF STRUGGLES. MORE RECENTLY WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME GENERAL FUND SUPPORT DIRECTLY FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS WE GOT SEVEN MILLION -- TWO FISCAL YEARS AGO AND WE GOT FOUR MILLION IN THE MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR. AND THAT COMES IN VERY HANDY ON ALL OF THESE PROPERTIES BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS IF I HAD A CHANCE I'M SURE THAT EVERYBODY HEARS VISITED THEIR LOCAL FAIRS. BUT AS YOU GO AROUND TO THESE FACILITIES A LOT OF THEM ARE VERY AGED AND A LOT OF THEM HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND SO IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY TO USE THESE FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE EFFORTS. YOU CAN SEE HOW IT'S PARAMOUNT TO HAVE THESE THINGS IN HIS BEST A CONDITION AS WE CAN BECAUSE AS MY COLLEAGUE MITCHELL TALK ABOUT LATER -- ALL THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MET AS WE DEPLOY THEM FOR THOSE PURPOSES -- ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU REALLY CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THIS REPAIRED Và FACILITIES AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN EXPECTATION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN CARRYING OUT THIS EMERGENCY MISSION. AS A WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT THAT WE RECEIVED FOR THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE AB FOURTEEN NINETY NINE THAT SET ASIDE THREE FOUR SO 1% OF SALES TAX PROCEEDS THAT COULD BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO FAIR GROUNDS. AND THAT'S GENERATED -- THE LAST ESTIMATE I HEARD WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THEY CAN ALSO COME BACK TOWARDS THESE FAIR GROUNDS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND THEN ALSO THAT MONEY CAN BE USED FOR SOME OF THE OPERATIONAL SUPPORT. I'M JUST A QUICKOVERVIEW OF THE FAIRS I KNOW YOU HAVE THIS MATERIAL IN YOUR PACKETS -- BUT THE DISTRICT AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATIONS MAKE UP THE BULK OF THOSE AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE UNDERNEATH -- DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NAG AS FAR AS OUR OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY GOES ON THESE ARE STATE FACILITIES FORTY ONE OF THEM ARE STATE OWNED -- OTHER ONES HAVE DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENTS LIKE LEAST FROM A LOCALITY OR SOME OTHER PARTY. AND THIRD DISPERSED. ALL OVER THE STATE AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS IS TO THEIR SUCH GOOD ASSETS IN AN EMERGENCY RESPONSES BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN EMERGENCIES CAN OCCUR. AND FRANKLY YOU DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW WHAT THE EMERGENCY IS GOING TO REQUIRE AND TILL YOU DEPLOY AND YOU START ASSESSING WHAT'S HAPPENING. WILDFIRESOBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GONNA LOOK FOR THE NEAREST LOCATIONS TO BE ABLE TO STAGE EQUIPMENT MOVE EVACUEES MOVE ANIMALS THAT ARE DISPLACED. THINGS LIKE THAT -- BUT IT WAS ONLY SO. THREE YEARS AGO NOW THAT WE HAVE THE OROVILLE DAM -- SITUATION WHERE THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY OF HAPPENING CATASTROPHIC BREACH OF THAT. AND SO OBVIOUSLY YOU COULD GO TO THE NEAREST FAIRGROUND AND SO THEY HAD TO LOOK -- QUITE A BIT FARTHER OUTSIDE THE REGION TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL FAIRGROUNDS BECAUSE THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE EVACUATION OF THE AND THEN ALSO THE SPECTER OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN IF WE STARTED TO EXPERIENCE THAT FAILURE. AND SO THAT'S WHY I SAY IT'S IT'S KIND OF A COMPLICATED THING THERE IS NO EASY ANSWERS ON A SIGNING FAIRS OR YOU KNOW PRE POSITIONING A LOT OF OF OF EQUIPMENT AND ASSETS TO BE READY FOR THINGS ALTHOUGH THOSE ARE IMPORTANT TOOLS TO DO. AND SO WHAT WE DO AS A DEPARTMENT IS AS WERE ORGANIZED -- TO DEPLOY ALL OF THIS VERY QUICKLY WE HAVE A DEDICATED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COORDINATOR BUT WE ALSO HAVE A DEDICATED BRANCH THAT PROVIDES THE OTHER AREAS OF OVERSIGHT FOR THE FAIRS AND EXPOSITIONS. WE HAVE AFFAIRS AN EXPOSITION FUND THAT FUNDS -- SOME OF THE SUPPORT FOR SOME OF THE MORE FISCALLY STRUGGLING FAIRS. AS WELL AS HE HANDLES ALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES WITH GETTING THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE MONIES OUT THERE AND VERIFYING THE PROJECTS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT. AND THE STAFF ALSO GO INTO A DIFFERENT MODE WHEN THEY DO GET ACTIVATED DURING AN EMERGENCY PERIOD. AND THEY BECOME A VITAL LINK IN THE COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDING INFORMATIONS ABOUT THE FAIR GROUNDS -- TO YES AS WELL AS ALL THE LOCALS THAT MIGHT NEED SOME OF THAT INFORMATION EVERYTHING FROM WHAT TYPE. OF FACILITIES DO YOU HAVE WHAT'S THE CAPACITY WOULD OF THE SIZE OF SOME OF THE BUILDINGS A DIFFERENT THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE SO DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THIS. AND ANOTHER THING TO NOTE JUST TO KEEP ALL THIS IN CONTEXT IS THAT ADDS TO THE COMPLEXITY OF FAIRS. IS THE TRADITIONAL PERCEPTION OF A FAIR IS IS A ONE TIME FARE OF AND USUALLY IN GOOD WEATHER HOPEFULLY NOT TOO OFF THOUGH BECAUSE SOMETIMES SECOND. NOT YOUR ATTENDANCE DOWN. IN SOME FAIRS ARE MORE ACTIVE AND THEY HAVE A CHANCE HAPPENING PRETTY FREQUENTLY THEY'LL HAVE CAR SHOWS OR THINGS LIKE THAT OR THE ANIMAL EVENTS WHERE THEY SHALL LIVE STALKER. THE THINGS LIKE THAT IN SO PEOPLE FORGET THAT THAT EMERGENCY FUNCTION OF FAIRS THAT THAT ASSET IS AVAILABLE THE REST OF THE TIME. BUT ALSO THE COMPLEXITY AS AS WITH THE UNPREDICTABLE NATURE OF EMERGENCIES AND WHEN YOU DO DEPLOY AFFAIR. THEN YOU HAVE TO THROW IN WHY THE COMPLEXITY OF THEIR FAIR VANCE OR OTHER EVENTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE SCHEDULED. THAT VERY MUCH UNDER RIGHT THERE FISCAL VIABILITY. AND SO SOMETIMES WE LOSE SIGHT OF THAT AND A LOT OF ACTIVITY HAPPENS DURING AN EMERGENCY. AND SO FROM OUR DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE WE TRY TO BALANCE ALL OF THOSE NEEDS AND THAT'S WHY WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND WITH ALL THE VARIOUS FAIRS OUT THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS ARE KNOWN BY EVERYBODY AND THAT THE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS ARE OPEN SO THAT THE INFORMATION. CAN FLOW FREELY AND EVERYBODY CAN MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON WHAT'S THE THE BEST WAY TO RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY. AND UTILIZE THE FAIR IN THE BEST MANNER AVAILABLE -- WITHOUT ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM -- YES TO DRILL INTO MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND HOW THE FAIRGROUNDS FIT IN WITHOUT WITH SOME FAIRLY SPECIFIC DETAILS OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU KEVIN -- AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS IT'S A REALLY. GREAT TO BE HERE TODAY AND AND TALK ABOUT CRITICAL -- TOPIC IT'S IMPORTANT TO US -- IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING FOR ALL OF YOU BECAUSE EVOLVED SEEN THIS FIRSTHAND BUT SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE'VE HAD PRESS TWELVE PRESIDENTIAL -- MAJOR DISASTER -- DECLARATIONS HAVE FOR THE STATE AND TO ACHIEVE THAT NUMBER MEANS IN A WERE ALWAYS IN EXCESS OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGE JUST TO GET TO THAT THRESHOLD TO QUALIFY SO THIS IS. AN EXCEPTIONAL TIME AND AND THERE WAS A TIME AND PLACE WHEN. VERY FEW FAIRGROUND -- MANAGERS WERE IN FACT PROFICIENT AT HAVING TO USE -- AND ALL OF THE DISASTER -- AREAS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HERE. THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE NOW -- JUST IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE FORTY THREE DIFFERENT FAIRGROUNDS -- THAT WERE USED AND UTILIZED OUT THERE SO WE START TALKING ABOUT -- SHELTERING OPERATIONS WHICH IS USUALLY THE PRIMARY PIECE THAT -- COMES UP AS AS WE CAN WITH OF ACTIVITIES. BUT BEFORE THAT THEY'RE STARTING TO BE USED TO STAGING AREAS RIGHT AWAY FOR FIRST RESPONDERS -- WE START MOVING -- SUPPLIES MATERIALS THERE FOR THEM WE USE MISS POINT TO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS -- THERE'S JUST A MULTITUDE OF REASONS THAT WE USE -- THE FAIRGROUNDS NOW AS PART OF OUR RESPONSE AND RECOVERY EFFORTS OF FOR US. I WAS PLEASED TO SEE ON THE AGENDA -- MANY OF THE THE REPRESENTATIVES COME TO TALK TO US BECAUSE JUST LOOKING BACK RECENTLY HERE WITH DIXON AND SILVER DOLLAR AND NAPA AND BUTTE -- ALL OF THEM ANSWERED THE CALL -- WHEN WE NEEDED THEM -- THEY WERE QUICK TO RESPOND AND TO OPEN THEIR ARMS AND BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. WHAT WE CALL THE WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TAKES PLACE -- FOR THESE DISASTERS SO FOR US. HAVING SAID ALL THAT I DO I DO KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME AREAS THAT YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT WERE AND WE CAN MOVE PROVED IT'S AND SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TELL YOU WERE -- WE WERE CAN IN HAND WITH -- CDFA -- ON A REGULAR BASIS AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE TRENDS THAT WE HAVE SEEN SO -- DURING. AND THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO ALL JUST WANNA GIVE SOME GOOD GENERALIZATION SO. MANY THERE IS WE GO TO SOON AS WE GET -- START DEALING WITH SHELTERING OPERATIONS -- WITHIN THE WITHIN THE FAIRGROUNDS -- WE START SEEING SOME ADA COMPLIANCE ISSUES THAT ARE THEIR THEIR CHALLENGE FORCE WEATHERED SHOWERS -- BATHROOMS -- AND OTHER FACILITIES WICH ARE AUGMENTING THOSE RIGHT AWAY WITH PORTABLES BUT THERE'S A TIME AND AND AND OBVIOUSLY -- A TIME COMPONENT THAT HAS TO BE THERE TOGETHER STUFF MOVED IN AND WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND BROUGHT INTO SITES -- BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WORK ON AGGRESSIVELY AND THEN -- ACTUALLY EVERY TIME WE HAVE A DISASTER WE DISPATCH SOMEBODY FROM OUR OFFICE IT'S AN EIGHTY SPECIALIST AND GOES OFF THEIR SHORES LOOKING RIGHT AWAY. AND WE START WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AT CDSS CDFA AMERICAN RED CROSS AND OTHERS -- FEMA AND START TRYING TO BRING RESOURCES AND TO AUGMENT THEM. ANOTHER AREA THAT -- WE SEE -- THAT'S ALWAYS AN ISSUE ONE IS IS THE COLOCATION AT SHELTERS WITH PETS AND ANIMALS SO -- TO FASTENING DISCUSSION BECAUSE WHAT WAS TRADITIONALLY A CAT AND DOG -- THIS KIND OF OPENED UP AND YOU HAVE A MORPHING OF OF WHAT IS YOUR PET AND AND WHAT DO YOU WANT THEIR HOW WHAT ALLERGIES DO YOU HAVE -- HOW DO YOU REACT RUN THOSE ANIMALS -- AND SO -- WHAT WE SEE IS A LOT OF FOLKS THAT BRING THEIR CARS FOR TRAILERS IN -- WE SELL IT REPETITIVELY THEIR PARKING IN THE PARKING LOT FOR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SERVICES THE MEALS SHOWERS EVERYTHING ELSE BUT MANY CASES ARE SLEEPING IN THEIR TRAILER OR THEIR CAR BECAUSE THEIR PETS FOR THEIR AND ARE KEEPING THEIR WITH THEM -- FOR THAT SO -- WE CONTINUE TO WORK THAT TRY TO FIND THE RIGHT SOLUTION THE RIGHT ANSWER IT'S HARD -- JUST IN A IN A GROUP SETTING WHERE YOU HAVE PEOPLE -- ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER AND IN AN EMERGENCY THERE'S ALREADY ENOUGH STRESS AND SO. WHAT CAN BE GOOD IT CAN ALSO BE -- A CHALLENGE FOR OTHERS AND SO FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IS SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE US SERIOUSLY AND ARE ALWAYS WORKING FOR A GOOD SOLUTION. ON THE OTHER AREA -- FOR US IS THAT -- WIFI INTERNET -- IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR SOMEBODY TO COME OUT AND NOT HAVE ANYTHING OTHER THAN. OTHER SMARTPHONE ON THEM AND SO -- FEW HOURS THAT PHONE MIGHT NOT BE CHARGED AND SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING AGGRESSIVELY WITH OUR CARRIERS AND THEY TEND TO BRING IN CHARGING STATIONS FOR US TO BRING IN A WIFI HOTSPOT -- USUALLY CALL THE CULTURE CALLOUS SELLING TOWER A LIGHT TRUCK HER CELL ON I WE'LL SEE IN A CAO CAO. AND THEY'LL TURN AROUND THE BRING THOSE IN. THEY WORK OKAY -- JUST DEPENDS ON THE POPULATION DENSITY IS HAVE THERE SO -- IF IT'S A REALLY -- IMPACTED FAIRGROUND AND THEN THAT THAT CONNECTIVE ITTY IS GOING TO BE A PRETTY SLOW IT'S LIGHT AND AND SMALL AND THEY WORK FINE -- FOR THE SMALL NUMBER THERE SO -- BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE BETTER BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH YOUR INSURANCE CARRIER TALKING YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS -- HAVING GOOD CONNECTIVITY IS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT -- FOR EVERYBODY THAT'S USED IN THE SITE -- REAL HANDLING EQUIPMENT SO IT'S NOT JUST LIKE IN A CONTROL START DROPPING SUPPLIES RIGHT AWAY INTO AN AREA THAT THEY DON'T HAVE BALLOTS -- PALLET TRUCK JACK'S -- FORKLIFTS THE ABILITY TO MOVE THAT MATERIAL AROUND AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT ON THAT CAN CREATE A DELAY THERE SO -- WE JUST SEE A WIDE VARIANCE OF OF PREPARATIONS AT EACH SITE THAT WERE OPERATING AND SOME ARE BETTER PREPARED THAN OTHERS AND HAVE BETTER RESOURCES AND THEN FINALLY. I WOULD SAY -- SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE -- AS POINTED OUT -- BY KEVIN YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE ARE MANY CASES THERE'S DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THERE SO IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH -- INFRASTRUCTURE -- WITH WATER OR WITH SEWER OR WITH -- POWER OUR H. BACK -- ESPECIALLY A HOT DAY LIKE IT IS TODAY -- THAT BECOMES A CHALLENGE -- FOR THE EVACUEES ARE THOSE ARE USING THE SITE. SO AFTER EACH DISASTER WE SIT DOWN AND WE GET WITH OUR OUR PARTNERS AND WE START WORKING ON AN AFTER ACTION REPORT AND WE MERELY START FIGURE OUT WHERE IS IF THERE IS A WE CAN IMPROVE AND WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER. AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS THAT -- AND START LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS IN TRYING TO GUIDE -- OUR PARTNER AGENCIES AND THOSE THAT WERE WORKING WITH EITHER THAT STORE GRANT OR THROUGH ANOTHER FUN SOURCES THAT ARE THERE OR FOR YOURSELVES OBVIOUSLY AND ANYTHING THAT CAN BRING. ON IMPROVE THE RESILIENCY OF THE READINESS OF THESE FAIRGROUND SO THAT -- WHEN WE DO NEED THEM -- THAT THEY'RE IN AN OPTIMAL SHAPE -- FOR USAGE -- WHAT? IN ADDITION TO WHAT I POINTED OUR SOME THERE IS IMPROVEMENT HERE IS THAT -- ARE WORKING WELL GOOD COMMUNICATIONS RIGHT NOW -- IT'S AMAZING HOW HOW WELL -- THAT'S WORKING ON HOW QUICKLY WERE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR ONE A LOT OF PREPARATION IT'S BEEN DONE FOR SITE MAP SOME LAYOUTS THAT REDUCES TIME INTO SO -- DISORGANIZATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE RESPONSE EFFORT BECAUSE THEY'VE MAPPED OUT WHERE THEY WANT RESOURCES TO GO -- WHEN YOU COME INTO A THE FAIRGROUNDS THAT'S A GREAT AREA AND THEN THERE'S BEEN -- AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF TRAINING THAT WE'VE SEEN -- AT THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND PART OF THAT IS OF COURSE IN THE INCREASED ACTIVITY -- THAT WE'VE HADHERE IN THE STATE -- SO THOSE KIND OF GO HAND IN HAND SO THAT PROFICIENCIES LED -- TO MORE EXPERTISE AND THEREFORE HAS REDUCED A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT -- YOU SEE THERE -- WE CONTINUE TO DO TRAINING TOGETHER -- WE DID LAST YEAR WE DID -- THE YELLOW COMMAND EXERCISE AT THE BAY AREA AND AND WE USED TO OUR FOR OUR PERSON IS THERE AND THEN -- CFA LEAD SO WHAT WE CALL EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUNCTION -- ELEVEN IT'S A CRITICAL -- SUPPORT FUNCTION IT'S PART OF OUR A STATE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND AND HOW WE PROTECT LIFE AND PROPERTY AND A COORDINATED RESPONSE IN THERE THE PRIMARY LEAD. UP FOR THAT WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS THEIR THEIR HAVING SAID THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. AND MOVE FURTHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO DO YOU HAVE LIKE BEST PRACTICES THAT YOU HAVE COORDINATED TOGETHER. AND I KNOW -- IN TWO THOUSAND TEN CDFA THEY DID A REPORT ON FAIRS AND DISASTER AND HAD ABOUT A DOZEN RECOMMENDATIONS. HOW HOW IS THAT IMPLEMENTATION GOING OR ISN'T IS IT EVEN STILL RELEVANT SOME ALMOST A DECADE LATER AS WE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE? I THINK WHAT'S RELEVANT IS LOOKING AT THAT FRAMEWORK OF IDENTIFYING SOME OF THESE DEFICIENT AREAS AND THEN WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH BOTH AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THAT AND COME UP WITH WAYS THAT WE FEEL WOULD MITIGATE THAT. AND WE ACTUALLY DID LOOK BACK OVER THAT IN A LOT OF THOSE AREAS HAD BEEN ADDRESSED -- ONE OF THINGS THAT ALSO HAPPENS ON A ROUTINE BASIS AND THIS IS ACTUALLY MULTI AGENCY. IS IS THAT THERE'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETINGS HELD OUT AT THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE. AND SO THERE'S ALWAYS A CONTINUAL DIALOGUE IN AN EXAMINATION OF THE BEST PRACTICES ACROSS A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT TYPE OF EMERGENCY SCENARIOS. OF WHICH OBVIOUSLY WE PLAY A BIG ROLE BECAUSE OF THE FAIRGROUNDS -- BUT ALSO ANY OF THEM THAT MIGHT INCLUDE ELEMENTS OF A FOOD PRODUCTION OR AGRICULTURAL ISSUES AND HOW THAT MIGHT IMPACT THEM. AND SO LIKE I SAY I MEAN THAT'S A MULTI AGENCY EFFORT WE ATTEND THOSE MEETINGS I BELIEVE QUARTERLY. AND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES COME TOGETHER SO THE WHOLE EFFORT OF EXAMINING BEST PRACTICES AND HAVING GOOD ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT'S WORKING. OCCURS ACROSS A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND STATE GOVERNMENT. AND AND I WOULD ECHO THAT -- MANY THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE TAKEN HEART AND ADDRESSED -- THERE THERE'S A FEW THAT. HAD NOT BUT FOR THE MOST PART THEY'VE ALL BEEN ADDRESS FORMAT AND THEN FROM. AS THE GROUP TECHNOLOGY AND ORDERS RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAD. AND REALLY THE FOCUS -- THERE'S IN THAT PRIMARY CORE COMPETENCY THAT THEY DEAL WITH -- FOR ANIMALS AND THAT IS A CORE KAPATID AT THAT -- A SEE IF IT HAS TO BE A READY -- FOR BUT WE SEEN SUCH A A LARGE USAGE ON THOSE OTHER AREAS -- THAT'S KIND OF CHANGED -- THAT SHIFT AND SO WE'VE OF MADE A A GREATER FOCUS TOGETHER AND AND MEETING REGULARLY AND WE'RE TO CONTINUE TRAINING AND ADDRESSES ISSUES. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOCALS COME UP AND TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THEIR EXPERIENCE AS WELL SO I MEAN SITTING UP HERE FROM THE STATE LEVEL WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WOULD BE THE ISSUE THEIR BIGGEST. THE BIGGEST COMPLIMENT. TO HOW THE THIS INTERACTION WITH THE STATE GOES AND THEIR BIGGEST COMPLAINT ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO BETTER. WHAT YOU START? JUMP IN. WELL THE BIGGEST. COMPLIMENT IS IS HAVING THE ACCESSIBILITY AND THE RAPID NISSEN WHICH WE CAN GET THE ASSET DEPLOYED AND BEGIN THE ACTIVITIES BECAUSE WE CAN JUST DEAL DIRECTLY WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS THERE UNDERSTANDS THE CONDITIONS OF THE CAPABILITIES. AND CAN ALSO RESPOND TO THOSE INITIAL FLURRY OF QUESTIONS THAT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AS TO WHAT YOU HAVE WHAT YOU NEED THINGS LIKE THAT -- AS FAR AS WHAT I WOULD SEE IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED. WOULD BE I THINK PROBABLY AT THE STATE LEVEL HAVING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SOME OF THE LOCAL CHALLENGES THAT THEY MIGHT FACE. AND A LOT OF TIMES WE END UP DEALING WITH SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE DEALING WITH THE EMERGENCY WHICH ISN'T ALWAYS THE BEST ENVIRONMENT -- FORGE OUT SOME SOLUTIONS THAT ARE AGREEABLE TO EVERYBODY ON MOVING FORWARD. AND SO I GUESS IF I WAS GONNA SAY ONE THING WE COULD DO A BETTER JOB OF THIS IS IN BETWEEN INCIDENTS. IS IS. TO HAVE A COMMUNICATION CHANNEL IN PLACE WERE CONTINUALLY HAVING THAT DIALOGUE THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY FOCUSED ON AFTER ACTION FROM THE LAST EVENT OR SPECIFIC TO WHAT WE ANTICIPATE IS WHAT MIGHT BE IN OF THAT BUT JUST IN GENERAL. YOU KNOW HOW THINGS WORKING AT THAT FAIR GROUND IN OUR THEIR CHALLENGES LOCALLY THAT WE THINK MIGHT BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW SO THAT ONCE WE DO GET INTO THAT ENVIRONMENT OF RESPONDING TO AN EMERGENCY. THAT WERE AWARE OF IT COGNIZANT OF IT AND CAN. YOU KNOW MOVE WITH A LITTLE BIT BETTER CLASS MOVES NESS IF YOU WILL TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE THAT EVERY GROUNDS HAS LIKE A EMERGENCY PLAN BUT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS LIKE A PRE ASSESSMENT APPROACH. OR IS IT THAT THE MERGE THESE TWO FLUID TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT -- I WOULD SAY EMERGENCIES MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO FLUID THERE'S EVERYBODY HAS PLANS IN PLACE. AND I'VE NEGLECTED TO MENTION EARLIER TO THAT WE PUT OF MAY REVISED PROPOSAL AND THAT INCLUDES A COMPONENT FOR US TO INCREASE OUR FOOTPRINT THE ANIMAL CARES ARENA WHICH IS ALSO RESPONSIBILITY OF OURS -- BUT THROUGH BUDGET ISSUES OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WE HADTO REDUCE SOME OF OUR STAFFING RESOURCES THERE WE OPERATED IT BY TAPPING INTO EXPERTISE AROUND THE DEPARTMENT WORD EXISTED. WHICH WORKS FOR THE MOST PART UNTIL IT DOESN'T AND HONESTLY CAMP SHOWED US THAT IT DID WORK THAT WELL BECAUSE WE HAD -- A FOREIGN ANIMAL DISEASE THAT STILL ON GOING DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE DEDICATED. TO AND SO IT REALLY STRETCH TO OUR BENCH IF YOU WILL OF WHO WE COULD TAP INTO TO RESPOND. AND SHOW THE NEED TO HAVE DEDICATED STAFF RESOURCES TO NOT ONLY BE READY TO RESPOND AND PERFORM THEIR ANIMAL CARES FUNCTIONS. BUT ALSO TO CARRY OUT THE TRAINING IN THE HELP WITH THE DEVELOPMENT UPDATING OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT PLANS OF WHICH THAT'S A BIG COMPONENT IN THE FAIRGROUNDS IS HOW ARE WE GONNA SHELTER ANIMALS. ARE WE GONNA HANDLE THEM WHAT TYPES OF ANIMALS IN AS MITCHELL MENTIONED EARLIER JUST ASSESSING DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES WITH WHEN YEAR COHABITATING DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANIMALS LARGE AND SMALL AND YOU KNOW. WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE BEST PRACTICES TO HAVE IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AS BEST WE CAN UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES? AND SO WE'RE KEEPING OUR FINGERS CROSSED THAT. ARE PROPOSAL AS SUBMITTED WILL BECOME PART OF THE ENACTED BUDGET AND WILL BEGIN THE HIRING PROCESS AND HAVE THOSE RESOURCES AVAILABLE SO THEY'LL DEFINITELY BE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT FAIRS LOOKING AT THESE PLANS AND HELPING THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO BE. READY. AND I WOULD. CLING I WOULD ADD TO THAT IS THAT I THINK -- IN ANOTHER FAIRGROUNDS WANT TO FAIL THEY THEY WANT TO PUT THE BEST FOOT FORWARD A LEGITIMATE IN THE OTHER TRYING AND WE'VE. TAX THEM IN WAYS THAT WE HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE AND YOU LOOK AT DIXON AND WHAT THEY HAD TO DO. WITH THE RELOCATION OF THE HOSPITAL AND AND WITH -- THE UNIQUE -- CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE AND SOME OF THE LONG TERM HOUSING THAT WE'VE HAD TO DEAL IN SOME LOCATIONS -- WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO LEAVE THE SITE IN BETTER CONDITION THAT WE HAD IT -- BUT THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR THEM AND I THINK THEY I THINK. THEY WOULD OBVIOUSLY LOVE TO HAVE MORE RESOURCES TO HAVE A A BETTER CONDITION SO THAT THEIR SET I MEAN THAT'S JUST. OF FORT. BUT YOU CAN GO MANY YEARS WITHOUT HAVING ANY ISSUES LIKE WE DID. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN -- BELIEVE TAKEOVER LIKE WE'VE HAD NOW AND IT'S JUST BEEN. ON A REGULAR BASIS AND SO -- YOU KNOW HOW YOU YOU KNOW WHERE THAT WHERE THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE AND AND HOW THEY CAN DO IT. AND THEN OF COURSE THE AS SECOND POINT OUT LOS REVENUE IS A CHALLENGE -- FOR THE FAIRGROUNDS IT'S TOUGH AND MEAN OBVIOUSLY WERE RENTING IT AT A FAIR RATE WHEN WE COME IN RENTS SPACE OUT AND SET UP LEASES -- WITH THE SITES BUT IN THE THIRD THERE'S OPPORTUNITY COSTS THAT THEY'VE LOST AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND SO -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT SAYS AS CHALLENGE FOR THEM WHEN THAT HAPPENS COURSE ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLE HAVE LOST EVERYTHING SO YOU'RE TRYING TO BALANCE OUT HOW I TAKE CARE OF MY LOCAL COMMUNITY WHO. HAS LOST THEIR HOMES WITH OKAY HAVE LOST A POTENTIAL REVENUE TIME IN THERE AND SO I WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE. ON THE STRUGGLES IN THE CHALLENGES AND EMOTIONAL -- COMPONENT THAT. AND I THINK THEY WOULD LIKE US TO PROBABLY DO A BETTER JOB ON POST EVENT WHEN WE'RE TRYING -- TO SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS -- IN A SOMETIMES THERE'S A DELAY IN THERE'S A CHALLENGE WITH CERTAIN FOLKS FOR LEADING OTHER SHELTERS AND HOW THAT'S COMMUNICATED IN -- ELIGIBILITY AND FOR THOSE THAT ARE -- NOT NECESSARILY THAT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SERVICES ALL THE WAY TO THE VERY VERY END. AND ARE I'M SLOW -- TO EXTRACT THEMSELVES ON TO SAY THAT. THE QUESTIONS MISTER CHOI. AND AND I THANK YOU FOR A FOR BEING HERE AND IN A PREVIOUS LIFE IN MY MISSPENT YOUTH OCTAMER TO BIRD IS COORDINATOR FOR STATE LOS ANGELES. AND I WENT THROUGH FLOODS AND EARTHQUAKES AND WHY THINGS WE DIDN'T REALLY PREPARE. FOR WAS WE HAD A LITTLE BITTY PARAGRAPH CALL RIGHT. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN NINETY TWO WHERE BROILED IN THE LARGEST CIVIL. UNREST IN HISTORY. OF THE COUNTRY. AND WE WEREN'T REALLY PREPARED BECAUSE NOBODY EVER THOUGHT. SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF THAT MAGNITUDE AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY MESSES UP OR YOU KNOW WE WE START TO GET. YOU KNOW IT WAS A TIME WE JUST HAVE FLOOD UNNOTICED SOUNDS WEIRD NOW BUT IT WAS A TIME IN THE EIGHTIES WHERE. I HAD TO BUY MILLIONS OF SANDBAGS TO STOP LOS ANGELES FROM FLOATING AWAY -- BUT WE BECAME PRETTY GOOD AT THAT BECAUSE YOU GOT PRACTICE BEING PRETTY GOOD AT DEALING WITH EARTHQUAKES I THINK WE COULD HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH A TSUNAMI BUT SOMETHING OF MAN MADE -- CATASTROPHE COULDN'T DEAL WITH AND SO MY QUESTION IS REALLY KIND OF I'VE HEARD YOU SPEAK OF A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU KINDA. CAN PREDICT AND AND MAYBE I WANT TO PUT ONE THING ON YOUR OF THE THINGS YOU YOU NEED TO LOOK AT IS -- THE HOMELESS SITUATION. IF ALL OF A SUDDEN EVEN IF IT'S JUST A SMALL COLONY A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE TO SHOW UP AT THESE DISASTER AT THE STILL CONTACTS TO STILL GO TO SEE STI. WE STILL GO TO EMMITSBURG OFFER TRAINING ON ALL OF THE ABOVE OKAY -- IF THEY SHOW UP -- THEY HAVE UNIQUE SET OF OF CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH WHICH YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER THOSE TWO COMMUNITIES. AND I I DO HEAR ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS OR PEOPLE BRINGING IN. DRUGS INTO THAT DOES DISASTER ACTION ON CENTERS I REMEMBER PEOPLE BEING AFTER SEVERAL ARRESTS. BEING THERE FOR SIX MONTHS. OR MORE -- BECAUSE THEY LOST THE BUSINESSES AND HOMES AND SO UP. IN YOUR AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THIS BECAUSE YOU COULD BE A STAGING AREA FOR A VERY LONG TIME. IT AND YOU LOOKED INTO MAYBE THE OTHER SERVICES THAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY THINK ABOUT IN A REGULAR DISASTER. FROM -- YES SIDE -- WE CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THOSE CHALLENGES THAT'S WHY CDSS A SUCH A A CRITICAL COMPONENT AND THEN THE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH -- TEAMS ARE THERE IDENTIFYING -- AND WORKING HAND IN HAND COLLABORATIVE THEY ARE YOU KNOW WHERE THEY EXISTING PRE EXISTING HOMELESS. THE PRESIDING MENTAL HEALTH CARE RECEIVERS AND THEN HOW TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES IS ARE GOING INTO IT -- WE DO THAT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ART AMERICAN RED CROSS AND WE DO THAT -- AT THE COUNTY SHELTERS THAT WERE WORKING WITH THEIR WHEN WE ARE ESTABLISHING THEM. A HAND IN HAND OF COURSE -- WE'RE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING IN A HOLE OF A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ALL MERGING MANAGEMENT AND I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU -- WE'VE -- HAD A OUR FAIR SHARE OF OF MUD SLIDES AND FIRES AND EARTHQUAKES AND OTHER ISSUES OF TAKE PLACE AND OFFICE OPEN WE WOULD HAVE TO GO OVER THE RIGHT WORD HERE ALREADY -- BUT WE'VE WE PRETTY MUCH COVERED EVERYTHING ELSE AND AND OUR PLAYBOOK AND BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS -- CHALLENGE FORCING WE CONTINUE WORK REALLY CLOSELY WITH THEM AND I WILL TAKE THAT ARE. THE EFFORT ON CBS FACE PERSPECTIVE AND FROM THE FAIRS AND I AM SURE THAT SOME OF OUR SUBSEQUENT PANELS PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BETTER INFORMATION TO SHARE BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DID DESCRIBE I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE IN A RECENT EVENTS. WHERE WE HAD HOMELESS POPULATIONS WHO SAW THE AVAILABILITY THE SERVICES UTILIZE THEM BUT THEN IT WAS A CHALLENGE BECAUSE IT'S -- YOU KNOW NOT. TRYING TO TRANSITION THEM BACK INTO -- TRADITIONAL HOUSING SITUATION BE THAT GOING TO A HOTEL STAYING WITH RELATIVES. YOU KNOW THEIR SITUATION ON THAT FRONT DOESN'T CHANGE. AND SO I THINK FOR US WILL CONTINUE -- TO BE OPENED UNDERSTANDING THESE DYNAMICS EXIST OUT THERE AND TO JUST BE -- WILLING AND ABLE PARTNER TO ALL THE OTHER AGENCIES TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND MAKE SURE THAT IT OUR FACILITIES THAT WITH THOSE SERVICES BECOME AVAILABLE AND THAT WE DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS [inaudible] THANK YOU. STREET IS MISSING. OKAY -- WHAT PREMIERES? STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE -- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME LEGISLATION TO ALLOW FOR BOTH. HOUSING THE HOMELESS AS WELL AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEY COULD POTENTIALLY DO ON FAIRGROUNDS PROPERTY. IS THAT ARE THOSE VIABLE ISSUES AND AND HOW HOW WOULD THE MIX BECOME AT A TIME OF AN EMERGENCY THAT -- THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND ACTUALLY -- I WAS HAVING A DISCUSSION EARLIER TODAY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF WORKING ON INFORMATION THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED BY DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES TO ASSESS ALL THE STATE OWNED PROPERTIES OF WHICH THE DISTRICT AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATIONS ARE A SUBSET OF THAT. AND THAT IS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS HOW BEST TO WE ADDRESS. THAT BALANCE BETWEEN HAVING PROPERTIES THAT MIGHT HAVE CAPACITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS ISSUES. BUT COUPLED UP TO THE FACT THAT IF WE DO THAT ARE WE POSITIONING OURSELVES TO NOT HAVE BEEN INADEQUATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE SHOULD THAT OCCUR. SO YEAH I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU BUT I HAVE AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT -- WE ARE CONSIDERING AS WE WORK THROUGH THIS EXERCISE OF ASSESSING THOSE PROPERTIES AND WHAT THE POTENTIAL IS FOR USING THEM. AND OBVIOUSLY IF OF THE SHELTERS ARE COMPLETELY OCCUPIED AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE A USABLE LOCATION FOR SAID IT JUST BECOMES A BURGER CHALLENGE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A STAGING AREA OR LOCATION -- BRINGING ME THE FIRST RESPONDERS TO COME. TO AN ESTABLISH FALLEN OPERATIONS WHICH HAVE TO FIND A DIFFERENT LOCATION FROM IT SO IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF A PRIOR WHICH HIRES PRIORITY FOR THE A LOCAL FOLKS ARE THERE OF USE OF THE SHELTER SAID AND THAT POPULATION BASE SIR. OKAY ANY FINAL THOUGHTS FROM. AND IT BUT I THINK WE'LL BOTH STICK AROUND THREE YOUR PANEL DISCUSSIONS IN CASE ANY QUESTIONS COME UP AND HE NEEDS MORE INFORMATION FROM US. TO BE GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH GEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY -- PANEL TO IS GOING TO DISCUSS FAIRS AS A STAGING AREA EMERGENCY SHELTER FOR ANIMAL PEOPLE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS -- AND THE INFLUX ON FAIR GROUNDS AND THAT'S GOING TO BE -- REBEKAH BARTLEY CEO OF CINEMA COUNTY FAIR AND EVENT CENTER. EARLY MORE DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER OF DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS STEEP KENNY CEO BUTTE COUNTY FAIR AND RICK PICKERING WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE FAIR. WELCOME EVERYBODY. THANK YOU -- BECKY BARLING CEO OF THE SNOW MY COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS A THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. NOT ONLY ON EVACUATIONS BUT ON EVERYTHING ELSE YOU DO TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURE SO WE APPRECIATE THAT THE TIME. I USED TO SAY THAT I WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY FAIR MANAGER THAT HAD THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THREE THREE EVACUATIONS AND UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE ANYMORE -- IN TWO THOUSAND THREE I ACTUALLY WAS -- THE CO -- WITH THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS RACETRACK. AND WE DID EVACUATION IS THERE. A TWO THOUSAND ANIMALS AT THAT TIME. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WE EVACUATED -- OVER TWO THOUSAND ANIMALS ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE. SO -- DEFINITELY A REAL EYE OPENER AND EXPERIENCE. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN I WAS -- SEVENTEEN I WAS THE CEO OF THE SOME COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS. AND DURING THOSE WILDFIRES AS YOU ALL REMEMBER WE EVACUATED OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE AND A FIVE HUNDRED ANIMALS. OF HAD ABOUT FIFTY NINE HUNDRED CAL FIRE FOLKS -- NATIONAL GUARD -- RED CROSS SO HEAD A LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN IN THIS YEAR NOT WILDFIRES BUT TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN WE DID EVACUATIONS FOR FLOODS IN THE CURRENT BILL AREA. SO -- AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS MENTIONED -- FAIRGROUNDS NOT ONLY DO FAIRS AN INTERIM OF ANTS. AND PROVIDE ALL KINDS OF ENTERTAINMENT AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL BUSINESSMEN AND WOMEN WE ALSO PROVIDE -- MAZING SERVICE AND EVACUATIONS -- CALIFORNIA NETWORK AFFAIRS PROVIDES ALL OF THOSE THINGS YEAH ON FAIRS. OUR GREAT OF FOR MAKE EVACUATIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE IN THE BACKGROUND WE'RE WE'RE OF IT MANAGERS -- WE HAVE HOUSING FOR LARGE ANIMALS -- HORSE STALLS ARENAS SMALL ANIMAL HOUSING FACILITIES WE HAVE THE TEAMS THAT ARE SKILLED -- IN IN A VENN COORDINATION WHICH DURING EVACUATION LIKE THIS REQUIRES A LOT OF SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE WITH THAT -- WE ALSO HAVE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH AW ENFORCEMENT AND EMERGENCY SERVICES HONOR WE USE UTILIZE THOSE SERVICES ON A REGULAR BASIS. ALL THE FAIRS NETWORKS HAVE TEAMS THAT ARE SKILLED IN HANDLING LIVESTOCK. AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE GAY COMMUNITY. THAT ASSIST GREATLY IN FINDING OF VOLUNTEERS TO HELP IN YOUR ANIMAL EVACUATIONS. WE HAVE EXISTING TEAM TO HANDLE JANITORIAL AND MAINTENANCE FOR ALL -- SO OPERATIONS -- MY TEAM PARTICULARLY -- NOT ONLY IN DEL MAR BUT ALSO IN SONOMA HELPED ESSENTIALLY -- FOR ALMOST A MONTH -- CAL FIRE WITH MOVIE IN A MOVE OUT OF SUPPLIES AND ALSO WITH RED CROSS. AND THEN ALSO CLEAN THE RESTROOMS ARE PICKING UP GARBAGE IN THE TYPICAL THINGS THAT YOU DO A FAIR. BUT DURING EVACUATION. RED CROSS IF YOU DON'T KNOW ARE BASICALLY ALTHOUGH IN TWO YEARS AND THEY'RE TURNED OVER ON A REGULAR BASIS SO THERE'S NOT A LOT OF CONSISTENCY. SO -- AT THE FAIR BECOMES REALLY THE OVERSEER OF THE OPERATIONS -- WHICH IS INTERCALATED DISCS THE SUCCESS OF WHAT HAPPENS FAIRS% HOLD DOWN THE FORT UNTIL THE CALVARY GETS THERE. FAIRGROUNDS ARE NOW MAKE EVACUATION SITES AND IT AND INITIALLY -- IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OF THE THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY -- YES THEY HAD PLANNED ON SMALL CENTERS -- HIGH SCHOOL GYMS AND CHURCHES AND THAT KIND OF THING AND THEN REALIZED QUICKLY THAT IT WASN'T BECOMING A MAKE EVACUATION AND INITIALLY TOLD US NO WE'RE NOT GONNA BRING PEOPLE OF FAIR GROUNDS. AND WITHOUT OVER A DAY WE HAD TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED PEOPLE AND UNFORTUNATELY IT SEEMS THAT NOW -- THESE WILDFIRES IN THESE EVACUATIONS ARE SO ROBUST THAT WERE INSTANTLY EVACUATED WHICH WE WERE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE'VE HAD SOME CHALLENGES WITH RED CROSS SHELTERS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT WAS KIND OF MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY BUT THEY DON'T ALLOW ANY ANIMALS -- AND IS STORY CLIFF YOU LOOK BACK AT WHAT HAPPENED A KATRINA -- WHILE THE PEOPLE STAYED IN THEIR HOMES THEY DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE THEIR ANIMALS. SO IN DEL MAR AND ALSO -- IN SONOMA WE ACTUALLY ACTIVATED TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHELTERS WE HAD A RED CROSS SHELTER. THAT HAD PEOPLE WITHOUT A ANIMALS AND WE HAD A SHELTER THAT ALLOW PEOPLE TO COME IN WITH THEIR DOGS AND THEIR CATS AND OF COURSE WE SEPARATED -- YOU KNOW HE ANY ANIMALS THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS WE KEPT AWAY AND WE HANDLED THAT. SO -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT RED CROSS IS VERY STRICT ABOUT BUT WE'VE ALWAYS FELT WERE OPENING UP AND TAKING THESE PEOPLE AND WE DON'T WANT EVAN CARS IN THE PARKING LOT. WE DON'T WANT HIM INTENSE WE WANT TO MAKE IN IN THE BUILDING SO THEY CAN HAVE THE SERVICES -- FAIRS DO NEEDED NEW INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S A LOT OF SUPPORT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE FUNDING THAT WAS CUT FROM FAIRS. AND YOU KNOW THAT'S MADE AN IMPACT BUT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT NEW NEW INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP FAIRS -- AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS RESTROOM IMPROVEMENTS A ROBUST WIFI -- BROADBAND I'M ACTUALLY WORKING WITH -- JOYS STERLING WHO'S ON THE CDFA BOARD ON A FEW NO JOY -- TO GET BROADBAND OPENED UP AT THE CINEMA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS AND THEN WORK ON OTHER FAIRGROUNDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO -- MIGHT I KNOW THAT -- CDFA IS WORKING ON THAT STRONGLY -- UTILITY IMPROVEMENTS -- MANY FAIRS HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT COME ON SITES AND AND THE SEWER SYSTEM IN THE WATER SYSTEMS -- FORTUNATELY FOR US AND I KNOW UNTIL MORE THAN YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM THERE ARE SOME FAIRS. PAVING OF DIRT PARKING LOTS LOTS AFFAIRS HAVE DIRT PARKING LOTS WE COULD YOU KNOW HELLO A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED FOR US SPENDING FOR LIGHT TOWERS AND GENERATORS WOULD BE GREAT -- SATELLITE CONNECTIVITY SEVENTY ONESELF OUR CELL TOWERS WERE BURNED IN THE CINEMA AND NAPA FIRE IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE IMPACT FROM THAT AS WE ALL LIVE WITH OUR CELL PHONES. EVACUATION SLIDE SUCH A SUPPLIES WOULD BE GREAT ON THE FAIRGROUNDS TO TO STAGE THOSE CARDS COME FOR KIDS BLANKETS PILLOWS -- WE ARE FORTUNATE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN RED CROSS WAS ABLE TO BRING SOME OF THESE ITEMS AND QUICKLY. UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAD. THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO OPEN UP EVERYTHING THAT WAS NEEDED AGAIN SOME ISSUES THERE -- ANIMALS FEEDING AND BETTING WEEKLY RECORDED WITH A LOCAL FEED STORE -- FOR FUNDING AND WHEN PEOPLE CALLING ABOUT DONATIONS WE HAD TO THE FUNDING GO THERE -- BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE SOME FUNDING THROUGH THE STATE THAT'S EARMARKED TO GET THIS MONEY SO THAT THESE FAIRS CAN ACTUALLY BUY THESE THESE ITEMS. BUCKETS HOSES RAKES WHEEL BARRELS VETERINARY SUPPLIES ALL OF THOSE ARE REALLY INTERCULTURAL -- TO THE OPERATION -- SO FUNDING THAT BECAUSE IT MECHANISM THROUGH THE STATE -- TO ALLOW FAIRS TO PURCHASE. THESE ITEMS WOULD BE IT WOULD BE A VERY KEY -- ADDITION TO HELP FAIRS EFFECTIVELY WORK ON THE EVACUATIONS. AND THEN ABILITY TO GET REIMBURSED QUICKLY FOR EVACUATION SUPPLIES THAT THEY DID HAVE TO SPEND. WANTED TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FEMA -- WE WERE I THINK THE FIRST FAIRS IN THE STATE TO BRING AND FEMA TRAILERS AFTER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE HAD A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OUR HAD NO EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH HIM IN THAT REGARD HOWEVER -- THROUGH THIS A FOUND OUT TO THERE'S LOTS OF CHALLENGES WHEN FEMA. GETS INDIVIDUALS INTO THOSE TRAILERS. THEY CAN REPLICATE THEIR RIGHTS BUT IF THE IF THE PERSON DOESN'T LEAVE THEY HAVE NO ENFORCEMENT ARM A GOES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHICH IS A GIGANTIC BIG BLACK HOLE -- AND WE ARE NOW I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO COURT TOMORROW TO TRAIN INVICTA FEMA -- INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS REPLICATED MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO WHO JUST WON'T LEAVE. SO THAT BECOMES A COST AND EXPENSE TO THE FAIRGROUNDS AND FEMA HAS REALLY NO ABILITY TO DO MUCH ABOUT THAT THEY DON'T DO BACKGROUND CHECKS. ON AB THAT GOES INTO THAT -- AND I HAD A COMMENT OR A CONVERSATION WITH -- THEIR TOURNEY ASKING THEM WHY THEY DIDN'T DO THAT AND THEY SAID IT'S BECAUSE WE WANT TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY AND THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN THERE THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY PROTECTING THE BAD PEOPLE AS WELL -- WE'VE HAD DRUG DRUG DEALERS OVERDOSES PROSTITUTION -- WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOMELESS -- IT WAS SURPRISING TO ME THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT I KNOW FRIENDS AND FAMILY NOT FAMILY BUT FRIENDS THAT LOST THEIR HOME IN THE FIRES. THAT WENT DOWN TO APPLY FOR FEMA UPS A SUPPORT AND WHEN THEY GOT DOWN THERE SOMEBODY ELSE AT ALL WE'RE ALREADY APPLIED FOR THEIR HOME. SO LOTS OF FRAUD HAPPENING AND THE VETTING SYSTEM IS IS NEEDS WORKS -- LOTS OF STORIES WITH THAT -- SORT OF IN CLOSING ACCOUNT WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT AYE OUR PREVIOUS -- SPEAKERS TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE FARES HELLO YES I THINK THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE. A BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN -- YES AND FAIRS AND MAYBE THERE'S A LADY I GUESS ON POSITION AT CDFA THAT COULD HELP WITH THAT. I THINK THAT WOULD REALLY BE -- IMPORTANT BECAUSE DURING THOSE EVACUATIONS THEY COME IN ALL OF A SUDDEN -- YES NEED SOMETHING WE'VE GOT CAL FIRE YEAH AND EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO JOCKEY TO GET WHAT THEY NEED. IF THERE IS A BETTER COORDINATION AND LIAISON WITH THAT THAT WE WORKED IN ADVANCE OF THAT I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. SO I'M GOING TO PASS IT ON HERE TO MY LIFE FORMER FOR OTHER MANAGERS AND TO BE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS LATER THANK YOU IS MORE. THANK YOU I'M I'M CURRENTLY MORE AND I'M CURRENTLY THE DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER AT THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS -- BUT I'M REALLY HERE TO SPEAK TO YOU ON TWO COMPONENTS BECAUSE FORMALLY I WAS THE CEO AT THE NAPA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS WHICH IS IN CALISTOGA. I WE GET REFERRED TO AS NAPA OFTEN -- BECAUSE THIS DISORDER THAT WAY -- BUT IT'S REALLY THE THE SMALLER FAIRGROUNDS UP IN CALISTOGA -- BEFORE I REALLY SPEAK ON MY POINTS I JUST WANT TO KIND OF REITERATE BUT BACK HE WAS STATING ABOUT WHAT HOW INTEGRATED WE ARE I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT REALLY GOES ON THE SONG ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY IS HOW INTEGRATED WE ARE WITH ONE ANOTHER. IN OUR PARTICULAR SITUATION IN CALISTOGA IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IN RESPONSE TO THE VALLEY FIRES THE FIRST PHONE CALL THAT I RECEIVED WAS ACTUALLY FROM BACKING AND HER TEAM IN SAN DIEGO. SAYS AND THE QUESTION WAS WHAT DO YOU NEED. DO YOU NEED PEOPLE DO YOU NEED RESOURCES DO YOU NEED MONEY DO YOU NEED EQUIPMENT AND THEY WERE ON A PLANE. I THINK THAT SAME DAY MAYBE THAT'S LATE IS THE NEXT MORNING -- TO COME IN TO HELP AND SO PART OF IT IS THIS NETWORK THAT WE HAVE IS AN INDUSTRY. ALONG WITH OUR OTHER INDUSTRY PARTNERS WHICH IS REALLY HOW WE WERE SUCCESSFUL -- IN CALISTOGA. SO -- I ALSO IN THOSE TWO CAPACITIES REPRESENT TWO OF THE COMPONENTS -- THERE'S ONE SMALL IN THE CITRUS FAIRS OF THE INDUSTRY AND THAT IS -- CALISTOGA IS A COUNTY OWNED FACILITY NAPA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS IS -- SO IT'S A LOCALLY OWNED WHEREAS THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS IS IT JUST IS THE TWENTY SECOND DISTRICT ASSOCIATION. AND BUT BOTH OF THOSE ALL OF THE FACILITIES REALLY WERE KIND OF FOUNDED AROUND THE THIRTIES -- AND WITH THEIR IF THE FACILITIES BUILT OUT THROUGHOUT THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES HERE WE ARE IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AND WE STILL HAVE MANY OF THOSE SAME. BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES AND THINGS LIKE THAT -- AND THAT WAS REALLY DONE THROUGH COURSE RAISING FUNDING SO PART OF WHAT I ALSO WANT TO JUST IMPRESS UPON YOU IS THE REALLY. OUR APPROACH AS AN INDUSTRY HAS ALWAYS BEEN WEARING INDUSTRY WE ARE THE CALIFORNIA NETWORK OF FAIR GROUNDS IT REGARDLESS OF WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE IS AND WHO OWNS THIS AND THOSE RULES ARE ASIDE ESPECIALLY WHEN E'RE UTILIZED IN THE CASE OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE -- FOR KIND OF FOLLOWING UP ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT -- KEVIN MASSA HER AND MITCH. MEDIC OF THAT I HOPE I PRONOUNCED THAT CLOSE -- JUST TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR ONGOING SUPPORT -- BUT ALSO I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF THE BACKGROUND OR UNDERSTANDING OF OF FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE FAIRGROUNDS -- THROUGH THROUGHOUT THE FUNDING FOR FAIR GROUNDS. ESPECIALLY IN MORE RECENT DECADES EVEN THE LARGER FAIR GROUNDS -- THE DELL MARS -- THE AND ORANGE COUNTY IS AND SO ON RECEIVE A SMALLER PORTION OF THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN AVAILABLE TO THE INDUSTRY LARGER PORTION GOING TO THE SMALLER FAIRS ARE MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND PART OF THE IDEA BEHIND THAT IS THAT AS HE'S LARGER FAIRGROUNDS THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITY TO IN ESSENCE GENERATE THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO PUT BACK INTO THE FACILITIES. BUT AS TIMES HAVE CHANGED -- AND REGULATIONS OF CHANGE AND THINGS LIKE THAT EVEN THAT IS GETTING CHALLENGING FOR SOME OF OUR LARGER FACILITIES. AS JUST AS AN EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IN DEL MAR AND WE HAVE A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT -- THAT WERE ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THAT. FOR LACK OF GETTING TO SCIENTIFIC IS BUILDING AN ULTRAVIOLET AND BIO FILTRATION SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN PROCESS OUR STORM WATER. NOT JUST CHARGE IT -- INTO THE RIVERS ARE THE OCEANS ANYMORE AND THAT SO WE CAN STAY IN THE BUSINESS OF HORSE RACING HORSE SHOWS AND LIVESTOCK SHOWS. THAT THERE'S NOT REALLY REVENUE GENERATOR FOR FOR STORM WATER AS AS YOU WELL KNOW SO. AND THEN FOR THE SMALLER FAIRGROUNDS -- FROM KIND OF THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES TO TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THEY RECEIVED ON AVERAGE ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. SO YOU REALLY HAVE THIS THIRTY FORTY FIFTY YEAR GAP OF THAT TYPE OF FUNDING AND THEN I'M SURE AS YOU KNOW A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS DOES NOT GO A LONG WAY WHEN IT COMES TO SEWER SYSTEMS. RUSLAN BUILDINGS HVAC SYSTEMS AND SO ON BUT IT WAS LEAST WAS BETTER THAN NOTHING. AND THEN WE HAVE A PERIOD OF A FEW YEARS WITH NOTHING AND SO THAT THE FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS -- FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WITH THE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED VERY MUCH NEEDED BUT IT'S REALLY JUST THE TIP OF THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG FOR US. SO -- AND UNLIKE FIRE CAMP OPERATIONS IT WAS ALLUDED TO EARLIER THAT AS FAIR GROUNDS WE RECEIVE PAYMENT FOR THE USE OF OUR FACILITIES IN THESE EMERGENCIES NOT ENTIRELY. YES IN A FIRE CAMP OPERATION AND THAT'S WERE -- YES AND CAL FIRE DO YOU PAY RENTAL FEE FOR THAT MORE AND MORE ARE FAIR GROUNDS ARE UTILIZES EVACUATION CENTERS AND WHAT WE GET IS A REIMBURSEMENT OF ACTUALLY GUNS EXPENSES INCURRED. WHAT WE DON'T GET IS ANY KIND OF MAKE UP FOR THE LOSS OF REVENUE THAT THE FAIRGROUNDS ITSELF WHICH IS HAVE TO BE SELF GENERATING TO SUPPORT AND PAY FOR ITS EMPLOYEES IT'S UTILITIES -- ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND BE THERE FOR COMMUNITY. THAT'S JUST THAT'S A LOSS FOR US -- OF THE BACKYARD HE SPOKE TO DEL MAR'S ROLE IN -- WHICH LED TO THEIR ABILITY TO HELP US OUT SO MUCH IN CALISTOGA SO IN CALISTOGA IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN A LITTLE SLEEPY CALISTOGA UP NORTH. THERE WAS A SMALL FIRE THAT BROKE OUT IN NAPA COUNTY WAS THE BUT CANYON FIRE. AND SO WE WERE ACTUALLY ACTIVATED OUR FAIRGROUNDS IS ACTIVATED FOR NAPA COUNTY RESIDENTS. WELL WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE VALLEY FIRE HAD BROKEN THAT SAME DAY ACTUALLY JUST A FEW HOURS EARLIER AND SO WHEN THE SOCIAL MEDIA WENT OUT THE EVACUATION CENTER OPENING CALISTOGA THOSE RESIDENTS UP ON UP ON THE MOUNTAIN IN ESSENCE IN LAKE COUNTY. I MEAN IT WAS TWO LANES ON A TWO LANE HIGHWAY I'M COMING INTO CALISTOGA AND SO WE WENT FROM A POPULATION OF FIVE THOUSAND IN OUR TOWN TO A POPULATION OF ABOUT -- SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED PRACTICALLY OVER NIGHT AND WAS REALLY ONE OF THE MORE RECENT FORAYS INTO THIS MASSIVE INFLUX -- AN EVACUATION CENTER -- INITIALLY THERE WERE SOME CHALLENGES BECAUSE WHAT WAS BEING REPORTED AS A RED CROSS WAS ON SCENE BUT WHAT WAS BEING REPORTED OUT WAS THAT WE HAD TWENTY THREE PEOPLE. IN THE EVACUATION CENTER. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE TWENTY THREE PEOPLE INSIDE. BECAUSE THE OTHER FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE HAD CHOSEN TO STAY OUTSIDE IN TENTS IN CARS -- BECAUSE TO STAY WITH THEIR ANIMALS TO STAY WITH THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY TO STAY IN ESSENCE WITH THEIR THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. SO IT WAS A LITTLE BIT DELAYED IN GETTING SOME OF THE THE RESOURCES IN SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THAT -- THAT PROCESS THAT EXISTS WITH -- WITHIN RED CROSS. DID YOU HAVE AVAILABLE IN THE SHELTER FOOD HOW MANY BEDS WERE AVAILABLE IN THE SHELL -- THERE WILL HELP FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE WERE BEING ASKED TO LEAVE THEY WERE BEING TOLD THAT THEY HAD TO LEAVE THEIR PETS AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU I PERSONALLY HAVE NOT BEEN THROUGH THE HAVING TO FLEE MY HOME WITH THE CLOTHES ON MY BACK. AND PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN MY LIFE OF MY PETS AND MY CHILDREN. AND TO HAVE A RIDE SOMEWHERE AND BE TOLD WELL HERE FILL OUT THIS FORM AND YOU CAN ENTER BUT YOUR ANIMALS THE MOST NEAR AND DEAR THINGS YOU HAVE NO IDEA IF YOU HAVE A HOME LEFT. IF ALL THIS FAMILY PHOTOS YOUR HEIRLOOMS. CLOSER TO AT WHATEVER YOU HAVE THE MEMORIES IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE OR NOT AND WE JUST IMAGINE THAT WAS VERY DEVASTATING SO AS THE FAIR GROUNDS WE STEPPED INTO THAT ROLE. AND WE SERVED THREE THOUSAND HOT MEALS A DAY OUR COMMUNITY MADE INTERNATIONAL NEWS FOR THE HOSPITALITY THAT WE SHOW TO THESE TO IN ESSENCE THESE NEIGHBORING FOLKS NOT EVEN OUR OWN COMMUNITY TECHNICALLY. IF PEOPLE WANTED TO GET INTO BOUNDARIES WE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE EVEN GOING TO BE REIMBURSED ARE COUNTY EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS OF THE AMMO USE AND THINGS THAT UNFORTUNATELY WEREN'T IN PLACE QUITE YET. SO IT'S REALLY QUITE THE UNDERTAKING AND WE WEREN'T SERVING BOLOGNA SANDWICHES AND PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICHES WE WERE SIR I CAN ATTEST TO THAT. I MEAN IT WAS REALLY JUST AND I THINK IT'S KIND OF RAISE THE AWARENESS OF JUST HOW MUCH WE CAN REALLY HELP TAKE CARE OF OUR COMMUNITIES IN THESE TIMES OF NEED IT WAS JUST IT WAS VERY EXPOUNDING THING THE AMOUNT OF COMMITTEE SUPPORT THAT YOU SEE COMING OUT. AND COOKING AND HELPING AND AND IT IS AN IMPERFECT BECAUSE OF THIS ROLE WE PLAY WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE A TRUST WITH THEM WE CELEBRATE THEM ALL THE TIME WHETHER IT'S AT OUR FAIRS OR THE OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT TAKE PLACE ON OUR GROUNDS THE KING THING YEAR AS THE WEDDINGS. THE FUND RAISERS SO THERE'S ALREADY THIS RELATIONSHIP AND OUR COMMUNITY CAME OUT OF THE WOODWORKS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE COMING IN WITH A BAD. WITH YOU TENSE AGAIN FOOD A CALL WENT OUT THAT WE NEEDED BATTERIES NEXT THING YOU KNOW A DURACELL TRUCK SHOWS THAT DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD. ONE SEMIS PULLING IN WITH THAT AND THEN NOT THAT ROLE WE PLAY IS FAIR GROUNDS WHERE WERE USED TO MANAGING EVENTS WERE USED TO MAINTAINING PUBLIC SAFETY THROUGHOUT THOSE MAKING SURE FIRE LANES STAY OPEN AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND SO GETTING THINGS PLACED IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE'RE MAXIMIZING THAT SPACE FOR ALL PARTIES IF CAL FIRE HAD NEEDED TO COME IN WITH A A FIRE CAMP OPERATION WE HAD SPACE SET ASIDE FOR THEM. THE SHELTER OPERATION WE WE WERE -- WE OPEN AS AN EVACUATION CENTER AND THEN WE RAN AS A SHELTER FOR FOURTEEN DAYS. AND IT'S NOT TOLL ON OUR FACILITIES THAT'S REALLY THAT THE CRUX OF OF WHAT I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT. BECAUSE OUR FACILITIES WEREN'T BUILT FOR THAT YES THEY'RE BUILT FOR INFLUXES OF LARGE PEOPLE BUT NOT SUSTAINING THEM NECESSARILY. AND SO AGAIN THREE ABOUT A THOUSAND THREE TIMES A DAY ABOUT A THOUSAND PEOPLE FOR A HOT WELL COOKED MEAL. WELL OVER THE COURSE OF THAT OUR KITCHEN SEWER SYSTEM FAILED. IT'S UNDERNEATH A CEMENT FLOOR IT CAN'T BE REPAIRED IN THE MIDST OF THIS SO TEMPORARY FIX WAS PUT IN PLACE FOR IT. FOUR YEARS LATER THAT TEMPORARY FIX IS STILL THERE BECAUSE WHAT IT WILL REQUIRE IS. POTENTIALLY TEARING DOWN THE BUILDING BUT AT LEAST TEARING UP THE FLOOR TO GET TO THAT FIX AND YET THAT'S A BUILDING THAT OUR COMMUNITY ALSO RELIES ON FOR THEIR EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES AS WELL -- WE HAD -- WE HAD ISSUES OF OUR SWAMP COOLERS WERE -- TURNED ON WITHOUT WATER. SO THEY BURNT UP IT WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTUNATELY OUR COUNTY DID PUT IN AN INSURANCE CLAIM FOR US TO REPLACE THOSE BUT THAT WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PROJECT TO REPLACE THAT. SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY AND A LOT OF OUR FACILITIES DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE PROPER VENTILATION HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING IN THE COURSE OF THOSE FOURTEEN DAYS WE WENT FROM EXTREME HEAT TO POURING FREEZING RAIN. AND PEOPLE INTENSE AND IN CARS OUTSIDE AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH -- FACILITIES TO PUT THEM IN -- SOME OF OUR OTHER CHALLENGES WERE THINGS LIKE PROPERLY FUNCTIONING GATES AND PERIMETER FENCE LINES AND THINGS AND AND A LOT OF FAIR GROUNDS HAVE THIS BECAUSE AGAIN THERE'S BEEN ONLY SO MUCH MONEY YOU'VE GOT A SELF GENERATED TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN YOUR SEWER SYSTEMS FAILING OVER HERE SO MAYBE. YOU DON'T GET OVER THERE TO REPLACE THAT GATE BUT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THE ADEQUATE PROTECTION AND SECURITY FOR EVACUEES BECAUSE YOU ALSO DO YOU WIND UP WITH A MIGRANT -- REVELERS. TO FIND OUT -- THERE'S MEALS THERE'S CLOTHING ITEMS AND THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE LITTLE OPPORTUNISTIC AND SO YOU KNOW WE WOUND UP WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HOMELESS POPULATION OR ARE COUNTY SHERIFF'S ARE SAYING. THEY'RE NOT HERE BECAUSE OF THE FIRES WERE FAMILIAR WITH THEM IN IN OTHER AREAS OF OUR OF OUR COMMUNITY -- YOU ARE RESTROOMS IN OUR SHOWERS THAT WE HAVE ON HAND AND WHILE IT'S GREAT THAT THE CALVARY IS COMING IN THESE OTHER RESOURCES WERE DEPLOYED SOME OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE IS FAIR GROUNDS A GO BACK TO THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. NEW TECHNOLOGIES NEW POWER DEMANDS ON SOME OF THOSE AND WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN ACTUALLY PLUG AND PLAY THAT SYSTEM IN. THE NEED FOR WIFI FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING TO OPERATE INCLUDING THE LAUNDRY FACILITY THAT OUR RIGHTS. COME IN BEING ABLE TO TO MAINTAIN THAT AND THEN ON TOP OF IT AGAIN -- THAT LOSS OF REVENUE THAT WE SUFFER AS EVACUATION CENTER AND YET LET ME BE CLEAR WE ARE ALL HAPPY TO SERVE IN THAT CAPACITY. EVERYBODY THE COMMUNITY RESPONSE PEOPLE COME OUT BUT AFTERWARDS. AGAIN BECAUSE WE ARE SELF GENERATING THOSE FAIR GROUNDS ARE THEN FACED WITH MANAGING THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS THAT LOSS OF REVENUE AND THAT COULD MEAN BUDGET CUTS IT COULD MEAN LAYOFFS IT'S HOW DO YOU GET THROUGH THE HOW DO WE RECOVER FROM THIS -- LONG TERM. THE ONE THING THAT HAPPENED AS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AS WELL AS AS WE PRESS FOR MORE INCLUSION AND ARE COUNTY -- YES AND ACTUALLY STATE -- YES CAME TO VISIT -- REALLY EVERYONE DID WAS JUST SUCH A CRISIS A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BUT AFTERWARDS GONNA DEBRIEFING ON AT THE COMMENT WAS THAT WAS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME EXPERIENCE [inaudible] THAT. THERE'S NO PRESIDENT BEFORE THERE WON'T BE AGAIN WE HAVE ALL JUST LIVED THROUGH THE MOST INCREDIBLE LIKE FIRE AND DEVASTATION TO HIT. AND THEN CAME TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN AND THE ATLAS PEAK FIRE AND THE TUBS FIRE BOTH BROKE OUT IN NAPA COUNTY AND YOU KNOW THE DEVASTATION THAT AS A CARRIED ITS WAY OVER TO CINEMA COUNTY. WE WERE ONCE AGAIN. AN EVACUATION CENTER THAT ACTUALLY TRANSITION MORE INTO AN INFORMATION CENTER AS POWER WENT OUT AND IS THE CELL TOWERS WENT OUT SO IN NAPA COUNTY EIGHTEEN T. IN ESSENCE FAILED IN CINEMA COUNTY VERIZON FAILED. SO WE BECAME THE INFORMATION CENTER FOR ANYBODY IN OUR COMMUNITY COMING TO FOR ANY KIND OF INFORMATION BECAUSE OTHERWISE. THE THE CITY'S ICS WOULD HAVE JUST -- I YOU SEE WOULD HAVE INUNDATED JUST WITH PEOPLE TRYING TO GET INFORMATION SO THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE DO BECAUSE AGAIN WE MANAGE THE FENCE AND WE MANAGE -- WE MANAGE PEOPLE. SO THEN OF COURSE WE ALL KNOW HAPPEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I'M AND LET STEVE SPEAK TO THAT -- A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE HE WAS MOVED. SADLY MUCH MORE INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THAT THEN I WAS BUT SOMETHING ELSE TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT WHILE WE SPEAK A LOT ABOUT THE WILD FIRES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN SO MUCH OF OUR RECENT HISTORY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE ALSO IS FAIR GROUNDS BEEN UTILIZED IN FLOODS IN POWER OUTAGES -- EPIDEMICS Là MANY YEARS AGO AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND WE CONTINUE TO SERVE IN THAT WAY -- SO. EVEN THOUGH I WE TEND TO TALK ABOUT IT IS OUR FAIRGROUNDS THERE YOU ARE FAIR GROUNDS THERE YOUR CONSTITUENTS THEY ARE CALIFORNIA'S FAIRGROUNDS. NEWS HOPE THAT YOU'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND AS YOU KNOW YOU TO LIBERATE ON HOW BEST TO INVEST IN ALL OF US. THANK YOU VERYMUCH. HI MISTER KENNY. SO THE BUTTE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS IS ANOTHER COUNTY. PROPERTY -- IT IS RUN BY FIVE ONE C. THREE NON PROFIT HAS BEEN FOR DECADES -- THE WORLD DOESN'T REALLY KNOW THAT JUST FOR AROUND EVERYBODY JUST THE IN GREATLY IT'S PROBABLY THE SOCIAL CENTER OF THE OF THE REGION BUT OUR SMALL TOWN OF FIVE THOUSAND THREE AGRICULTURALLY DOMINATED -- AND THEN -- ON THE NOVEMBER EIGHTH -- FIRE BROKE OUT AT SIX THIRTY I THINK BY NINE THIRTY WE GOT THE FIRST CALL THAT WE WERE GONNA BE A LARGE ANIMAL HELTER. AND NINE FORTY FIVE WE GOT THE CALL WE'RE GOING TO BE RECREATIONAL TERROR -- THE FOR OTHER EMERGENCY SITUATION. BUT AS YOU MENTIONED WELFARE PEOPLE AND IT'S JUST. IN THIS SORT OF A WAY OF JUST ANOTHER EVENT TO ME NOT TO MAKE IT SMALL BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY WASN'T BUT WHERE THINGS NEED POWER AND WATER YOU PUT THINGS THAT. NEED POWER AND WATER AND NOT ROCKET SCIENCE TWO PEOPLE IN THE FAIR INDUSTRY IT MIGHT BE IF YOU HAD A CO IT COMPLETELY VOLUNTEERS -- WITHIN FOR WE HAD A SEVENTY SEVEN DAYS WE OPERATE IS A LARGE ANIMAL SHELTER -- WE HAVE A NEW I THINK IT'S CLOSER TO SEVENTEEN HUNDRED BELIEVES FIFTEEN HUNDRED ANIMALS THERE INCLUDING TWO HUNDRED HORSES WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. WAS AN AMAZING THING SINCE WE'RE NOT REALLY PREPARED FOR SYSTEM -- BUT I'LL TALK ABOUTTHAT IN A SECOND -- WE HAD EVERY HORSES MULES DONKEYS LLAMAS PIG SHEEP GOATS TURKEYS CHICKENS DUCKS RABBITS AND OTHERS -- FORTUNATELY -- BUTTE COUNTY ALREADY HAS AN ORGANIZATION THAT WAS PREPARED FOR LARGE ANIMALS SO -- THEY WERE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS BUT THEY WANT THE WHOLE STORY -- UC DAVIS CAME IMMEDIATELY TO THE RESCUE IN PLAYED A BIG ROLE -- WITHIN HOURS ARE FARMING COMMUNITY WAS BRINGING IN EXTRA PENS WE HAD SO MUCH FEW FOOD. FOR THESE ANIMALS THAT AT THE END OF THAT SEVENTY SEVEN DAYS WE WERE GIVING THE PEOPLE OVER THERE PICKING UP THEIR ANIMALS AN OFF THE LAST FOR A COUPLE MORE GO BACK IS INCREDIBLE WHAT CAME OUT -- IF WE GET PANELS THAT CAME OUT FROM THE STATE FAIR I MEAN IT IS. THAT THE COMMUNITY WAS JUST A FABULOUS THING AND THAT AND THE LARGE ANIMAL SHELTER REALLY SHOWED FOR THAT -- WE'LL GET TO SOME OTHER ISSUES A DIRECT LARGER SO CERTAIN -- THEN IN THE HUMAN SIDE AS I SAID WE WERE CALLED INTO PLAY IT BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK ON ON FIRED A IN -- THE FIRST SHELTER WAS ACTUALLY THE GM THAT WE LEASED TO THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL. AND IT WAS JUST YOU CERTAIN GIVEN TO THIS -- DESPITE OUR LEASES AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF WHICH WE LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THAT LATER -- BUT THAT WAS HAD A CAPACITY OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND OR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY PEOPLE -- ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF LATER DO THE ANIMALS -- THE COUNTY HAD. SEEN ALL THE SHELTER JUST POP UP IN A LOT OF ONE PEOPLE THAT WOULD LEAVE THEIR PETS. AND THEY WERE NOT MEETING ANY SORT OF CODE -- HEALTH CODE REQUIREMENTS SO THEY TOOK. OVER ANOTHER ONE OF OUR BUILDINGS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME ACROSS ACTUALLY ATTEMPTED TO RUN. A SMALL ANIMAL SHELTER BY ATTEMPTED TO RUN. THEY PRESENTED IT LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO RUN IT BUT ACTUALLY THEY GAVE IT DID YOU MEAN TO SAY. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IN AN AGRICULTURAL WORLD IMAGINE YOU DO UNDERSTAND THIS THE MAIN SOCIETY AND THEN POSSIBLY THE NORMAL AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY ON EXACTLY THE SAME MINDSET SO THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING HAVING THOSE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. HE SAID THAT VERY WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU -- WE HAD -- A QUARANTINE FACILITY -- PUT UP WITHIN ABOUT SEVENTY TWO HOURS TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE TWENTY TO THIRTY PEOPLE -- WE HAD A VERY LARGE RV INTEND VILLAGE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY SPREAD OUT ALL OVER THE GROUNDS BUT WITHIN ABOUT A DAY AND A HALF WE HAD TO GET THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT OUTTHERE. AND PUT A MODEL ONE PLACE BECAUSE WHAT WE ALL LEARNED ABOUT LATER WAS THE DRUG TRAFFICKING IN ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT WENT WITH THAT WERE REALLY RAMPANT AND WE NEED. TO PUT IN A BOX AND CAN BE A WATCH OF WE ULTIMATELY HAD -- AND HOW YOU IDENTIFY PEOPLE LATEST SELF IDENTIFIED IF YOU WILL SO PEOPLE SO THIS INTERESTING THING ABOUT RED CROSS -- THEY DON'T ACTUALLY OWN THE PEOPLE THERE OUTSIDE THE GIVE THEM SERVICES BUT THEY DON'T MANAGE THEM. SO WHICH WAS AN APPARENT FOR A DAY AND A HALF PROBABLY -- AND SO THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE LIVING OUT THERE THAT ACTUALLY PROBABLY WON'T EVEN AVAILING THEMSELVES OF SERVICES THEY WERE JUST THERE BECAUSE THEY WERE HOMELESS AND TAKE. THAT THEY COULD GET SOME BENEFIT OUT OF IT TEHAMA A LOT OF AND GET FREE TENTS AND BLANKETS AND THAT SORT OF THING. OF THERE WAS A LOT OF FREE FOOD -- BROUGHT IN WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND THEY WERE LIVING LARGE FOR FOR AWHILE -- THERE WERE -- OVER FIFTY STAFF BETWEEN RED CROSS AND SECURITY HOUSE ON THE GROUND IN OUR BUILDINGS -- NO IDEA HOW MANY VOLUNTEERS BUT HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS -- PROBABLY A COUPLE HUNDRED ON BOTH SIDES EACH ARE OVER THE PERIOD THE HUMAN CHARTER LASTED THIRTY DAYS AND BASICALLY -- BECAUSE OF SOME COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES -- PARTICULARLY WITH HIGH SCHOOL IN THE GYM -- IT BECAME APPARENT TO THAT IT WOULD BE BEST IF THE THAT PART OF THE SHELTER WAS RELOCATED TO SILVER DOLLAR. AND SO IT IT MOVED THERE AT THAT TIME -- WHAT WHERE WE RETAIN A LARGE ANIMALS FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THAT WAS ACTUALLY HANDLED AT A PRETTY HIGH LEVEL WITH RED CROSS WASN'T SOMETHING THAT? FOR ROASTED -- AT THE PEAK OF USE ON A PERCENT OF HER GROUNDS FACILITIES WERE USED -- CARLENE GAVE A SPEECH A FEW YEARS AGO AND SHE SAID IF YOU EVER GET A DISASTER MAKE SURE ON THE GROUND. AND SO I TREATED LIKE I'M RUNNING AT ALL AND AT THE END WE HAD GIVEN IT ALL UP IT WAS. QUITE AMAZING -- THIRD AT ALL HOW MANY ACRES YOU FOR ONCE -- JUST UNDER -- FORTY THERE WERE SOME REALLY AMAZING THINGS COME OUT OF WITH ALLUDED TO IT BEFORE BUT THIS NETWORK OF CALIFORNIA FAIRS THAT WERE IN AND AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE EACH HAVE AROUND IT AND AND EACH ONE OF US REPRESENTS COMMUNITY IN. TOGETHER THAT'S A VERY LARGE COMMUNITY -- TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OUT REACH -- BOTH CDFA AND SEE IF AS A SENSE STAFF DOWN IN THE FIRST WEEK TO JUST HELP WITH THE CRAZINESS OF ADMINISTRATING. SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- AND WE HAD THREE DIFFERENT FAIRGROUNDS BRING DOWN SEND ON THEIR FACILITY CREWS -- AT VARIOUS TIMES STILL KIND OF BAYLOR OWN LITTLE TRUE OUT FROM. BEING GROUNDING IN IN THE NEW OR WHATEVER ELSE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FROWNING AT THE TIME. UC DAVIS AS I MENTIONED IT'S BEEN A LOT OF HELLO TREMENDOUS MY RESOURCES UP THERE THEY'VE ALSO DONE QUITE A BIT OF STUDY WORK ON THAT. PARTICULAR PROJECT IN SHOULD HELP WITH FUTURE DISASTERS -- EVERY SERVICE CLUB EVERY. CHURCH GROUP EVER READ THE CITY SERVICES. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT EVERYBODY POURED OUT -- FROM DURHAM OR A BILL -- BIG SCREEN LADY. DOWN IN A LIVE OAK IT WAS A LITTLE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT CAME FORWARD -- IN AND IN A LITTLE THE ONE LAST LITTLE AMAZING SIGHT POINT FORGET SOME OF THE NEGATIVE STUFF -- WE HAD GOTTEN A GRANT. THROUGH THIS IS -- FAIR FUNDING TO UPGRADE TO MORE WIRE -- LEXICAL SERVICES AND WE REPLACED FIVE PANELS. FOR TRANSFORMERS IN TWO OF THE LARGE SERVICE PANELS I'M AND THAT WORK IT WAS COMPLETED ON THE DAY WE OPENED A SHELTER. KIND OF LIKE THERE'S THERE'S SOME BEING CONTROLLING THESE THINGS AND I WAS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL WE WOULD NOT HAVE ENABLE HANDLE WITH FEDERAL. FORTIES AND FIFTIES POWER PANELS AND AND HOME TRANSFORMERS -- SIGNIFICANT BURDENS -- PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ONE THAT WE'RE STILL LIVING WITH IS THE DAMAGE THAT IS CAUSED BY -- OPERATING THE SHELTERS AND RETAIN -- OLIVER DIRT ROADS AND SOME OF OUR ASPHALT ROADS SOME RAFFLE ROSE RETURN IN THE DIRT AND ARE DIRT ROADS ARE TURNING THE BIG HOLES -- THE GOOD NEWS IS THIS WEEK WE STARTED REBUILDING THIS ROUTE SO IT TOOK THAT LONG FOR THE FUNDING TO COME BUT THEY WILL BE BETTER THAN THEY EVER WERE SO THAT THAT'S A THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS -- FUNDS FOR SOME OF THESE REPAIRS ARE REALLY SLOW AND AND AND NOT KNOCKING A PROCESS BUT AS A SMALL NONPROFIT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ON SOMEBODY GIVES US THE MONEY SO. THERE WILL BE SOME THINGS THAT MAY. WAIT FOR A QUITE AWHILE TILL SOME OF THIS FUNDING COMES IN AND WE'LL JUST HAVE TO DO THAT -- I MENTIONED THE SEVERE DRUG ABUSE SITUATION WE HAD IT DID NOT SEE THAT ONE COMING -- ACTUALLY SOME OF THE VERY FIRST PERSONS THAT WERE IN THERE THE TENSE ARRIVE BEFORE THE ARMIES AND THEY MOSTLY ALL PROBABLY FELL INTO THAT CATEGORY. ONCE WE FIGURED IT OUT -- IN THIS WAS THEY WERE TALKING CAM FINDING SYRINGES AT EIGHT THEY IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT IN SHOWERS AND RESTROOMS AND THAT SORT OF A INTO IN THEIR PORTABLE ONCE FEMUR RED CROSS -- YEAH I WAS IT WAS CALLOW YES THAT RESPONDED THAT I BELIEVE FOR THE MOST PART AND COUNTY. AND WITHIN TWO DAYS THEY HAD TO DO THE FIRST DUMP RUNS TO THE SANITATION DEPARTMNT WITH THE WATER AND IMMEDIATELY IT WAS ALL TREATED AS BIO PLACED. FROM THAT POINT FORWARD AND THAT WAS AN EYE OPENER THE WHOLE TOWN AND REALLY WE JUST DON'T SEE THAT SORT OF THING AND SO WE WE GOT OUR EYES OPEN THAT DAY -- VERY LONG HOURS FOR A VERY SMALL STAFF THERE ONLY THREE FULL TIME EMPLOYEES AT THE FAIRGROUNDS HE HAD. FOUR FIVE MORE SEASONAL WORKERS THAT WE BURNED OUT WITHIN A MONTH -- THERE ARE. THAT. IS THE DAMAGE THAT MIGHT TAKE A WHOLE NOTHER YEAR TO ACTUALLY WORK THROUGH ANY START THING ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ALL THE RESEARCH THAT WENT INTO VOLUNTEERISM ALL THE FARMERS THE BROTHELS EVERYBODY'S GOT THIS FATIGUE. FROM AND THAT DID THAT EXISTS -- AND AND WHILE AS A COMMUNITY WE CELEBRATE OUR SUCCESSES ON AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT STILL LINGERING THAT THE HAPPINESS WEARS OFF AND YOU STILL HAVE THAT -- FROM A FAIR NETWORK POINT OF VIEW WHAT I THINK I'VE GOTTEN OUT OF IT -- IS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS WHEN IT WERE REPEATING THIS OVER AND OVER THAT REALLY IS THE PLACE -- WE AS AN EXAMPLE WE'RE GOING TO THE PROCESS WE MAY END UP WITH A FEMALE GRANT TO PUT INTO EMERGENCY GENERATORS ON TO THE BUILDINGS THAT I GOT A NEW POWER PANELS. THAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE LESS AND SOME OF THE BURDEN EITHER ON THE CAPACITY OF THE OUTSIDE PEOPLE TRAINING POWER OR IF WE TRULY HAD. A FOLLOW UP EMERGENCY LIKE BAD TURN OFF THE POWER WE WOULD AND IN THREE BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT -- BUT IT'S IT'S EVERYTHING -- POWER POWER BOXES THAT WERE USED BY THE PEOPLE'S SLEEPING THE TENTS IN THE RV'S. OUR PANEL'S EVER PLACED THERE IN THE FIFTIES I MEAN HOW SAFE CAN AB AND IN THE RAIN THERE IS A PRICE ON HIS GUY. AB GIVEN ELECTRIC SLEEPING BLANKET A SLEEPING BAG. AND IT'S RAINING IN THE AS A PLUGGED IN AND I'M THINKING. TRONG WITH THIS PICTURE. I COMMENTED TO HIM I'M NOT SURE QUITE UNDERSTOOD. WHILE I WAS THERE -- I THINK ALSO AS A AS AN INDUSTRY WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE THREE OF US HAVE BEEN REALLY ENGAGED IN THIS BUT THERE'S ABOUT. THIRTY PEOPLE PROBABLY THE SAID IN OUR INITIAL MEETINGS. AND AND THE CITY OF A AND SAVE US A WERE INVOLVED IN IT BUT WE WE ARE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A DISASTER TEAM PUT TOGETHER -- ONE COULD RESPOND AND SAY FOUR HOURS YOU KNOW THAT THEIR ME A CALL SERVICE SOMEWHERE AND WOULD HAVE A ON INVENTORY OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT CAN SERVE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS. BECAUSE IT TOOK YOU KNOW FIVE OR SIX DAYS TO GET THIS THING RUNNING RIGHT BUT IF THEY WERE. THREE CEOS AND THREE OFFICE MANAGERS AND THREE FACILITY MANAGERS. IS THAT ONE WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE DONE IT WITHIN A DAY BECAUSE IT'S HE JUST CAN'T GET EVERYWHERE AT ONCE -- I'M I'M SURE ANY ANY FAIR MANAGER ANY FACILITIES PERSON IF YOU HANNAH MAP WHAT THE FAIRGROUNDS LOOKS LIKE DURING A FAIR. CAN GO AND FIGURE THIS OUT IT'S NOT THAT HARD SO WE WE JUST NEED THAT RESOURCE THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A STRIKE TEAM BASICALLY OF FAIR MANAGERS OR STRAIGHT TEAM OF STATE OFFICIALS AND IT WELL IT WOULD BE IT WOULD. IT WOULD BE PEOPLE THAT ARE FAMILIAR WITH FAIRGROUND SO IT WILL PROBABLY GO PRETTY DEEPLY IN THE FACILITY SIDE OF THINGS -- THEY WERE GETTING TO THE CRUISE A CAME OUT AND HELPED US I MEAN WE HAD SOME VERY EXPERIENCED CREWS CAME OUT FROM LARGE FAIRS. AND YOU KNOW YOU BRING FOR PEOPLE THAT ALTHOUGH AS MUCH AS OUR LEAD GUY. AND THEY GO FIND THEIR OWN PROJECTS TO FIX AND THEY'LL HAVE TO DO IS GIVE AN ACCOUNT AT THE HARDWARE STORE THE STUFF IS GETTING DONE -- THAT ALLOWED US TO TAKE CARE SOME SAFETY ISSUES THAT WE MIGHT STILL BE DEALING WITH NOW IF THAT HAD COME SO -- BUT IF THEY WERE THERE FROM THE BEGINNING THAT WE COULD MAYBE PREVENTED SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS MAYBEWE COULD SET O. G. THOSE FAR FOUR PANELS OVER THERE NEED SOME WORK LET'S JUST. NOT EVEN USING FOR THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND FIX THEM FIRST. THAT KIND SORT OF THING -- AND THEN ALSO THE RAPID ACCESS -- TO ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT -- RED CROSS. AND CALLOW YES WHEN THE TWO DIFFERENT FORKLIFTS FOR THE EIGHT OUR SMALL FLEET OF ANCIENT FORKLIFTS. AND NEITHER ROOM CAME WITH THE WITH THE LIFT COULDRETAIN THE ROTATING LISTS. SO YOU CAN'T GET TRACTION ARE BROWN'S YOU CAN'T MOVE YOU CAN'T REALLY MOVE MUCH OF ANYTHING WITH THOSE -- AND THE NEWEST FORKLIFT WE OWN IS -- SEVENTY NINE AND THAT PERISHED IN THIS BATTLE -- WE ARE NOW ACTIVELY SEEKING USED ONE TO REPLACE IT AND THE OTHER TWO ARE CRIPPLED FROM IT AND AND THAT'S THOSE ARE DATED A OPERATING MACHINES WE NEED ALL THE TIME. SO COME BY A FAIR TIME IN TWO MONTHS WE HAVE TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM -- BUT IT IT REALLY IS MORE TO THE IMMEDIATE NEED OF THE DISASTER NOT SO MUCH OF THE FAIRGROUND THAT HAD. HAD THERE BEEN SOMEWHERE TO APPROPRIATE NEW FORKLIFTS OCCURRED JUST WHOOPED IN FOR THIRTY DAYS AND THEN GONE BACK TO WHERE THEY LIVE EVEN IF IT WAS RENTED BY SOMEBODY BUT THEY HAVE TO BE SET UP TO WORK ON THE FAIRGROUNDS WILL GO ON TURF. BE ABLE TO GO IN THE WET IN BE ABLE TO OPERATE THIS IS A THE NEED -- WE ALSO HAVE BEEN ACQUIRING A LOT OF LIVESTOCK PANELS BUT THE NEED FOR PANELS IS SO IMMENSE IN SUCH A SHORT TIME. THAT NUMBER OF COURSES DESCENDING ON OUR PROPERTY IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD TIME WAS -- THE PROPERTY HANDLE THAT FIND THAT THE EQUIPMENT WAS IN IN SHORT SUPPLY AND AND WE ARE DOUBLING AND TRIPLING ANIMALS WHICH PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOR A DAY OR TWO UNTIL. TRUCKLOADS CAM -- TO TAKE CARE OF IT. GENERATORS TRACTORS TENTS LIGHT TOWERS ALL THE SAME SORT OF STUFF THAT EVERYBODY WOULD NEED IF IF IT IF IT WERE. GIVEN TOWARD AROUND THE GROUNDS AND WE COULD SAY WELL OF A FLAT BED CAME UP FROM THE CENTRAL PART OF THE STATE. AM STOP AT THREE THREE FAIRGROUNDS ON THE WAY UP HERE. AND EACH HADSOME PIECE OF EQUIPMENT MEANT FOR DISASTER THAT WAS SAVED FOR THAT THEY START ON THE TRUCK AND BRING IT. INTO THE NEXT FAIRGROUNDS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY GOOD THING TO PLAN -- FOR THAT WAS CARRYING HIM MY MARK ALL. RECORD WITH ONE MORE THING. WHEN NEW AREA THE FAIRGROUNDS RECENTLY HAVE GOTTEN INTO SPACE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- WITHOUT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH CAL FIRE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE RECENT EVACUATION CENTERS BUT IT WAS THE P. JEANNIE BASE CAMPS WHICH IS REALLY -- WORKING WITH PRIVATE ENTERPRISE -- FOR THE SAKE OF SOME OF THE RESPONSE -- ORIGINALLY THESE BASE CAMP AGREEMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WERE PUT INTO PLACE FOR IN THEIR MIND YOU KNOW AFTERWARDS FOR THEM TO COME IN RESTORE POWER AND THINGS LIKE THAT -- IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AS YOU I'M SERVE WELL AWARE PM P. JEANNIE HAD TO CLEAR ALL OF THE THE LINES AND SO WHAT THEY DID IS THEY ACTIVATED MANY OF THESE BASE CAMPS CALISTOGA WAS ONE OF THOSE. AND UTILIZED -- SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR PROPERTY FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS BUT ONE THING THAT'S INTERESTING AND DEALING WITH PRIVATE ENTERPRISES WHEN IT FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY. THE FAIRS LEFT WITH AN IRA YOU. AND THAT THAT CAL STARTED FAIRGROUNDS IS STILL TRYING TO COLLECT ABOUT A SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR DEBT FROM P. JEANNIE. FOR THE USE OF THE FACILITY IN RESPONSE TO THIS SO THAT'S I THINK THAT'S JUST SOMETHING ELSE -- MAYBE TO PERHAPS TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AND A LESSON FOR ALL OF US IS HOW DID HOW WILL IT WORK WITH THESE PUBLIC ASSETS. AND AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WHEN WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER YOU KNOW. HOW THEIR BUSINESS -- MAY GO IN THE FUTURE. AND RIGHT NOW UPSTAIRS AND UTILITIES ARE HAVING A A HEARING ON ON ON WELL. MY U. S.. AND JUST HE RICK OF JUST GIVING ONE SECOND. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT. CHALLENGE FOR FAIRGROUNDS IS THE PLAN WITH PGA NEED TO CUT SERVICES CUT TRANSMISSION -- DURING A YOU KNOW EVENTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE A WILDFIRE -- WE ACTUALLY HAD EVACUATIONS LAST YEAR WHEN THEY DID THAT AND THEY'RE LOOKING NOW. IN CINEMA COUNTY AT ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WOULD LOSE SERVICES SO. IT'S A IN THE COUNTY LOOKED BACK TO US SAYING YOU KNOW CAN YOU BRING PEOPLE IN CAN YOU CAN YOU PUT IT IN YOUR FACILITIES CAN YOU HOUSE -- CAN YOU. TAKE CARE OF DURING HEAT EVENTS THAT KIND OF THING SO IT'S NOW ANOTHER. LAYER OF EVACUATIONS THAT'S GOOD IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE COMING DOWN AND YOU'LL HAVE BACKUP GENERATORS YEAH NO. OKAY. SOME OF ITS MAJOR FALLING BACK CATEGORY OF WHERE THE POWER GET CAT YEAH RIGHT YET THAT'S WHERE THESE FOLKS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE COMING. A DISTINGUISHED HERE THANK YOU FOR GRACIOUSLY SHARING YOUR TIME. STAFF TIME AS WELL. RICK PICKERING COUNT YOUR CALIFORNIA STATE FAIR NEXT POSITION. MY BACKGROUND IS ACTUALLY A MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT IN LA IN ORANGE COUNTY BEFORE GETTING INTO THE ORANGE COUNTY FAIR. WHICH IS THE DA AND THEN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY FAIR WHICH IS A NON PROFIT ON COUNTY LAND AND NOW YOUR STATE FAIR. THE BACK DURING MY CITY MANAGEMENT DAYS THE CIVIL UNREST WHAT WAS YOUR FURNITURE RIGHT IT'S VERY ACCURATE. I HAD THAT EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS EL NINO AND ONE MEDIA AND THE FLOODING IN LA IN ORANGE COUNTY. BUT HISTORICALLY. THE STATE FAIR WAS CREATED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE. FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING THE BUSINESS INTERESTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED AS WE BECAME INCORPORATED AFTER THE GOLD RUSH OUR POPULATION TRIPLED. IN ONE YEAR. PEOPLE LEFT THE FARMS A LEFT THE RANCH IS THE STATE LOOKED AROUND AND SAID OH MY GOODNESS. I DON'T THINK THESE RESULTS TERMS THEY SAID WE HAVE TO FEED ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOW COME HERE. THE STATE HAD A CRISIS THAT HAD EMERGENCY OF PEOPLE COMING FOR GOLD BUT THEY LEFT THE FARMS AND THEY LEFT THE RANCHES THEY ABANDONED THE SHIPS IN THE HARBOR IN SAN FRANCISCO. SO THE THE MERCHANDISE ITEMS YEAH THE PHONE JUST SEEN THE PICTURES OF THAT -- BUT NOW WE DIDN'T HAVE FOOD. AND FOOD. PRICES JUST SKYROCKETED SO THE STATE LOOKED AROUND IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR THEY CREATED THE STATE FAIRGROUNDS AND THE FIRST STATE FAIRGROUNDS YOU KNOW IS CAPITAL PARK. SO YOU CAN WALK TO THE HISTORICAL PARTS OF THIS BUILDING AND SEE THE OLD CAPITOL PARK. ON AND THEN THE STATE SAID SO WE WANT THE STATE FAIR TO BE THE PINNACLE OF ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY. TO PERPETUATE THE BUSINESS INTEREST TO THE PEACE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT EMERGENCY AT THAT POINT IN TIME WAS FEEDING PEOPLE. THE STATE THEN LOOKED AROUND AND SAID HOW DO WE TAKE THIS KNOWLEDGE AND SPREAD IT ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE WE'VE SET UP THIS NETWORK OF COUNTIES. LET'S CREATE FIFTY FOUR DISTRICT AGAS SO SHE HINS SMALL STATE AGENCIES. PLACED ONE IN EACH COUNTY ADDITIONALLY IT'S MORPHED OVER TIME AND THEN. WE CAN START GETTING PEOPLE BACK IN THE FARMING BACK AND ANIMAL PRODUCTION BACK INTO FEEDING. LOCALLY AND THEY DID THAT TO THIS CONCEPT OF COOPERATION AND EDUCATION BUT IT WAS ALSO. COMPETITION AND THEN YOU SHARE THE RESULTS OF YOUR COMPETITION AND THE PEOPLE WANNA EMULATE THAT SUCCESS SO AS YOU TALK TO THE FAIRS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY. BEEN PROVIDING THIS LEVEL OF DISASTER SERVICES WE'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM EACH OTHER -- WE'VE SHARED IDEAS WE SHARE DOCUMENTS WITH -- YES AND CERTAINLY WITH APART THE FOOD AGRICULTURE. BUT BUT TAKING THAT CONCEPT OF WHERE WE ORIGINALLY CAME FROM. THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE WE FOUND OURSELVES AGAIN AND JUST. IN RECENT YEARS I BEING USED TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE MERGING SEES THAT PREPARE FACED BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT. CALYX WILL BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN SOME OF THE FAIRS YOU'VE HEARD FROM. A WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT UNFUNDED STATE AGENCIES SO WE'RE NOT TUCKED UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AGRICULTURE. WE SET OUT HERE AS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION -- AND AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE ALSO HAVE A DIFFERENT WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH -- YES AND FOOD NAG VERY POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS -- SO -- YES IS OPEN THIS UP SEVERAL TIMES IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE OROVILLE DAM INCIDENT WE WERE IN MEDIATIVE ACTUATION SITE BASED ON HOW WATER WOULD COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY PHONE -- FOR ANIMALS FOR PEOPLE. THE FIRE SEVERAL DIFFERENT FIRES -- THAT THERE'S OTHER THINGS WE GET OPENED UP FOR THAT. THE GENERAL PUBLIC DOESN'T SEE ACROSS THE STREET FROM CAL EXPO IS THE GOLD COUNTRY. ACHEI NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RED CROSS HEADQUARTERS. SO WHEN THEY HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE FLOODING INTO CALIFORNIA FLYING INTO THE AIRPORT DRIVING IN AS VOLUNTEERS WERE THEY KEEP THEM WHERE THEY STAGE A MULTI STAGE ONLY COUNT LIKE SPOT. SO WE CAN PICK UP FOR FIVE HUNDRED RED CROSS VOLUNTEERS IN A MATTER OF A DAY OR TWO AND THEY'RE ALL WONDERFUL PEOPLE LEAVING THEIR THEIR LIFE BEHIND ON HOLD IN THE MIDWEST AND COMING TO HELP US IN CALIFORNIA -- BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BE FED AND THEY CAN BE REDEPLOYED -- EIGHT COMPUTERS. WIFI ACCESS AT SUTTER SUBTLY -- YES HAS WORKED WITH US AND AND PERHAPS DIFFERENT WAYS -- FOR EXAMPLE ON ON ONE DAY DURING THE OROVILLE DAM INCIDENT WE DISTRIBUTED SIXTEEN THOUSAND LUNCHES. ANOTHER WORDS A COLLECTION HUB AND THEN A REDISTRIBUTION OUT TO TWO OTHER FAIRS -- WE TALKED ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF LOANING EQUIPMENT OUT OR SENDING A LARGE ANIMAL PANELS A COUPLE TRUCKLOADS UP. UP NORTH. DURING ONE OF THE FAIRS ONE OF THE FIRES WE TOOK ONE OF OUR BACKUP RADIO SYSTEMS. AND DROVE IT UP TO CALAVERAS COUNTY AND SET UP AN ENTIRE RADIO NETWORK COMMUNICATION BECAUSE CELL TOWERS WERE GONE. LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD TALK THE FAIR PEOPLE COULDN'T TALK BECAUSE THEY TYPICALLY AFFAIR WILL RUN A RADIO SYSTEM DURING A FAIR. AS SO THOSE TYPES OF THINGS FAIRS FAIR. SO SO WE LOOK AT THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. AND THEN WE LOOK AT CAL EXPO AND IT'S AN PART OF ITS IN THAT CONCEPT IN TWENTY TEN STUDY THAT YOU HAVE HERE. BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DETERMINED CAL EXPO IS THE NATIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL STOCKPILE FOR ALL OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE EVENT OF A PANDEMIC. SO WHAT WOULD THEY EXPLAIN IT TO US OF THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE HAPPENS THEY WILL FRIENDS OFF CAL EXPO. AND ALL THE HOSPITALS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE THEIR SUPPLIES FROM THAT FEDERAL PHARMACEUTICAL STOCKPILE -- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY TO THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY HAS DESIGNATED CAL EXPO NOW AS A FALL BACK CD GOVERNMENT. FOR CONTINUITY PURPOSES SO THE CAPITAL HAS EMERGENCY EVACUATION HALF THE MEMBERS AND STAFF ADMINISTRATION GO TO HIGHWAY PATROL HEADQUARTERS HALF GO TO CAL EXPO. SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE'VE RECEIVED A FAIR AMOUNT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDS TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICE THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO ENHANCE OUR OUR WIFI IS SUPER SPEED NOW. BECAUSE ALL EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM MORE LIKELY MIGHT GO TO CALYX WILL WITH THE COMPUTER OR PHONE INDEED TO CONDUCT THE STATE'S BUSINESS. SO A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THERE -- CALYX WILL ALSO HAS SOME OF ITS OWN POWER GENERATION ABILITY HAS A ONE MEGAWATT PHOTOVOLTAIC PROJECT THAT'S BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. AND WE'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH OUR LOCAL UTILITY COMPANY AND TGS FOR POTENTIAL FIFTEEN MEGAWATT SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE DEEP BATTERY STORAGE. SO NOT ONLY COULD WE PRODUCE IT BUT WE CAN BECOME IN ESSENCE A MIKE REGRETTED AS AS A FALL BACK SEE THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE STATE SO THOSE TYPES OF NEGOTIATIONS. I CONTINUE TO TAKE PLACE. CALLASPO BY STATUE ALSO HAS ITS OWN POLICE DEPARTMENT. THOSE POLICE OFFICERS ARE WITH US PART TIME FULL TIME SEASONAL WE HAVE OUR OWN JAIL FACILITIES ARE OFFICERS ACTUALLY HAVE STATEWIDE POLICING AUTHORITY. SO WE DO ASSIST OF THE COUNTY THE CITY THE PARK RANGERS AT CENTER ON CERTAIN ENFORCEMENT AND WE ARE PART OF THE CIVIL UNREST PLAN FOR THE SACRAMENTO REGION IN FACT WE'VE MOST RECENTLY WERE. CALLED UPON BY THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO TO SUPPORT THEM WITH SOME OF THEIR CIVIL UNREST -- SO THEY ACTUALLY USE CAL EXPOSE THE STAGING LOCATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE MALL. AND AND A LOT OF THOSE TYPES OF DETAILS ON CALLASPO'S DESIGNATED BY SAM CISCO BAY AREA AS A KEY TSUNAMI RECOVERY FACILITY YOU MENTIONED THE FLOODING A LITTLE BIT EARLIER. HOW FAR WOULD THE TSUNAMI WAVE COME THROUGH THE BAY AREA TO FAIRFIELD IT'S ULTRA THEY BELIEVE CAL EXPO IS FAR ENOUGH AN ELEVATED SLIGHTLY HIGH ENOUGH -- THAT WE'D BE A KEY FACILITY IN THE EVENT OF A TSUNAMI IN THE BAY AREA -- CALYX WILL LIKE OTHER FAIRS HAS QUITE A WORKED WITH FEMA TO ESTABLISH FEMA TRAILERS FOR HOUSING OF OF SOME OF THE FAMILIES. AND WE'VE. WHILE THE RELATIONSHIP INITIALLY IS VERY POSITIVE WITH FEMA ONCE THEY'RE DONE THEY LEAVE. AND THEN. EVERYTHING IS LEFT BEHIND. AT THE THE CONCEPT OF RED CROSS WONDERFUL VOLUNTEERS TRAIN SITE MANAGERS IN MANY CASES BUT THEY ROTATE BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH OF THE CRISIS ON THE COMING FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU MAY HAVE A OUTSTANDING SHELTER MANAGER FOR A DAY OR TWO AND THEN THE NEXT DAY YOU'RE STARTING FROM SCRATCH. THIS FROM SCRATCH MEANING HERE'S THE RESTROOM HERE'S THE SIGNED AGREEMENT. THERE'S ALSO NO INSURANCE THAT COMES WITH A DEAL WITH RED CROSS. IN FACT IT SAYS THEY'RE NOT INSURANCE INSURING YOU. IN OUR CASE -- WITH RED CROSS WE RENTED THE SAME ISSUES WITH A SMALL ANIMALS AND LARGE ANIMALS THAT'S NOT. IN THEIR PURVIEW BUT BECAUSE WE'RE AN INDEPENDENT STATE AGENCY WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE INVOLVED IMMEDIATELY AND CAL -- YES LEGAL COUNSEL INVOLVED AND CAME UP WITH SOME LIGHT CAME UP WITH SOME INSURANCE DOCUMENTS SO THAT IF YOU SIGN THE DOCUMENT YOU COULD BRING YOUR PET AND BUT IT'S BASICALLY OF YOUR PASSWORD TO BITE SOMEBODY ELSE. I HAVEN'T MENTIONED YET THAT. ALL OF US. ENSURE THE PROPERTIES AND FACILITIES WITH NO FUNDING FROM THE STATE. SO IN THE CASE A CAL EXPO OF A DOG BITE SOMEBODY IT'S CAL EXPOSE SELF INSURED BY. THE POLICY CALLASPO'S PAID FOR ON ITS OWN. SO THERE IS NO INSURANCE FOR THESE FAIRS SO WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS WE GET SUED. FOR EXAMPLE OF A SHELTER OPENS UP AND AND LOCAL HOMELESS COME IN. A RED ROSS IS VERY CLEAR THEY THEY WILL NOT PICK AND CHOOSE. YA COME WHICH IS GREAT BUT ONE RED CROSS LEAVES WHATEVER IS LEFT IS LEFT. SO THEN AS A STATE AGENCY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WE'VE BEEN LEFT WITH HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. THAT ARE NOW HOURS. UNTIL WE CAN WORK WITH THE LOCAL COUNTY THE LOCAL CITY LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICES AND TRY TO ASSIST THOSE. AND YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT WHEN A HOMELESS PERSON GOT INTO THE SHELTER NEXT TO A FAMILY. THE FAMILY. IS ALREADY GOING THROUGH DRESS AND STRESS AND NOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT THAT PERSON WHO'S JUST NOT QUITE. WHAT THEY'RE USED TO IN THEIR FAMILY ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR KIDS ARE PANICKED TO PETS ARE PANICKED -- THE THE THE RED CROSS WORKERS ARE. ALL YOU GUYS DEAL WITH THAT. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THEIR SKILL SET THEIR WONDERFULLY WONDERFULLY BIG HEARTED PEOPLE -- FROM CAL EXPOSE POINT OF VIEW. WE DECIDED THAT BECAUSE WE'RE AN INDEPENDENT STATE AGENCY ALTHOUGH WE HAD ASKED EDS AND OTHER AGENCIES TO DO A INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITY A SMALL CESSNA THEY SAID. YOU'RE NOT PART OF US A SO WE HIRED ZERO WEST ZERO WEST CAME IN THIRD PARTY COMPANY APPROVED BY A D. G. S. DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AGRICULTURE. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEY DIDN'T INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITY ASSESSMENT AND DETERMINED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. TO PREPARE CAL EXPO FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS. SO THAT'S POWER WATER SEWER A LOT OF THAT TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S ALSO CHANGES AND SEISMIC STANDARDS ENERGY REQUIREMENTS A NUMBER OF OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO BUT WHEN YEAR. YOUR WERE AS GOVERNOR BROWN SAID IF WE DON'T FIX THE ROOF WE REALLY DON'T CARE WHAT THE WALLS LOOK LIKE. SO SO THAT'S THE TYPE OF CONCEPT THE TALENT THERE -- AS PART OF THE STATE'S TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY STATE BUDGET AND IT CAME FROM THE ASSEMBLY SUBCOMMITTEE BUDGET. SOME WOMEN COOPER AND WITH WITH MUCH OF YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL INSERTED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUDGET OF THE STATE FOR CALYX BLOW. ON AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE AND WE'RE GOING WE'RE GOING RIGHT DOWN THE LIST OF PROJECTS THAT THAT THIRD PARTY STUDY SAID YOU NEED TO DO THESE FIRST. AND MOST OF THOSE ARE GEARED TOWARD EMERGENCY SERVICES. IT TOOK THE STATE. THIS IS NOT A CRITICISM IT'S REALITY IT TOOK THE STATE SIX AND A HALF MONTHS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE SIX FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO CAL EXPO. BECAUSE WE DON'T EXIST. IT'S IT'S BAFFLING WE WORKED WITH WELL SOME OF THOSE A TRANSITION TEAM TRANSITIONING OF GOVERNOR'S OTHER BUDGET ISSUES THAT WERE OUT THERE. BUT THERE'S NOT A SINGLE LINE ITEM IN THE IN THE STATE BUDGET IN ANY DEPARTMENT FOR CALYX WELL IN THE STATE FAIR. SO WHILE -- YES WAS COOPERATIVE FOOD NAG WAS COOPERATIVE DEPARTMENT FINANCING WAS VERY COOPERATIVE THEY ALL SCRATCH THEIR HEADS AND SAID. I GUESS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO THIS IS TO WRITE A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR CHECK TO CAL EXPO AS A VENDOR TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO. WE APPRECIATE THE CREATIVITY THAT GOT THERE. BUT WHEN WE ASKED THE QUESTION IS IF THIS BODY WANTED TO MOVE SOME FINANCES TO CAL EXPO THE ANSWERS YOU DON'T EXIST THERE'S NOT A SINGLE LINE ITEM WE CAN PUT IT. THAT EXIST SEEMS LIKE THAT THAT COULD BE CORRECTED IN AND WE'RE TALKING TO GOOD PEOPLE ABOUT THAT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THAT. IN SECRETARY ROSS FROM FROM MY POINT OF YOU COULD NOT BE A BETTER CHEERLEADER FOR FAIRS. AND WHAT WE DO -- I WOULD SAY SHE WOULD. SAY SOMETHING SIMILAR TO YOU IT'S THE STRUCTURE THERE'S A STRUCTURAL CHALLENGE. SO WHEN WE WHEN WE MEET WITH BODIES LIKE THIS WE REMIND FOLKS THAT. THE INSURANCES OF THESE LANDS AND STRUCTURES OWNED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN OUR CASE IS PAID FOR BY OUR ABILITY TO SELL CORN DOGS. MY POLICE OFFICERS ARE PAID FOR BY MY ABILITY TO SELL COTTON CANDY. OF THE FIVE HUNDRED EVENT DAYS A YEAR BASICALLY GO TO ENSURE THE PROPERTY PAY FOR THE UTILITIES. COVER ALL THE PAYROLL ALL THE OLD TAB. WE'RE THE ONLY FAIR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT PAYS PRO RATA. SO FIGURE THAT OUT THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO SUPPORT THE STATE WERE THEN BILLED ABORTION PRO RATA -- THE MOST RECENT BILLING FOR THE LOAN BETWEEN THE STATE AND PURRS -- WE RECEIVED A ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR NOTICE FROM FINANCE SAYING HERE'S YOUR ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE YOU'RE PART OF THAT. PAY BACK RIGHT BUT WE DON'T EXIST BUT YOU BILL US. SO JUST UNIQUE THINGS LIKE THAT ON OPERATIONAL FUNDING WHICH WE'VE MENTIONED. CALYX WELL AND MANY OF THESE OTHER FAIRS GET CHARGED FEES FOR SERVICES BY OTHER STATE AGENCIES. SO CAL HR'S ASSISTING WITH THE RECRUITMENT. WE FAIRS ARE PAYING CAL HR IN MY CASE [inaudible] IF. IN ALL THE FAIR SKATE OR ALL THE DA CASES THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE DOES OUR PLANCHETS. ISSUES A PERMIT AND MY CASE FOR THOSE FIVE HUNDRED EVENT DAYS WE CAN BE PULLING FOR FIVE FIRE PERMITS PER WEEKEND. PER PER ONE PER PROMOTER FROM CAL FIRE AND WHILE THE GREAT TO WORK WITH ITS TWO HUNDRED PLUS DOLLARS AN HOUR -- AND WE UNDERSTAND THEY NEED TO BE A FEE FOR SERVICES TO STATE AGENCIES. BUT THOSE OTHER STATE AGENCIES ARE PROFOUNDLY SUPPORTED BY THE GENERAL FUND. SO YOU HAVE NON GENERAL FUND SUPPORTED STATE AGENCIES PAYING FEES TO CAL H. R.. TO IN MY CASE OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY. THEY'LL COME OUT AND SAY -- WE NEED TO TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR COMPUTERS AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG AND HERE'S AN EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLAR BILL. HI OUCH AND THEN TWO YEARS LATER WELL YOU GUYS YOU JUST CAME UP ON THE ROTATION AGAIN HERE'S ANOTHER HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR BILLS FOR US TO LOOK AT YOUR COMPUTERS. AND WE SAY BUT YOU DON'T PROVIDERS COMPUTERS. IMMATURE AN INDEPENDENT STATE AGENCY WE NEED TO BILL YOU. AND IT I DON'T WANNA MAKE IT SOUND LIKE. IT ALL GLOOM AND DOOM SB FOURTEEN NINETY NINE IS HELPFUL. IN FACT WE HAD WORKED WITH -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND JUST TO GET THE POLICY DECISION TO ALLOW PART OF THE SALES TAX TO COME BACK TO SUPPORT THE NETWORK AFFAIRS. THE EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IS THREE QUARTERS OF 1%. SO IF YOU WERE TO TAKE THAT AND MULTIPLY IT TIMES THE STATE'S 6% WHAT SIX TIMES EIGHTEEN AND THAT WOULD BE ON A LOW NUMBER. SO SUDDENLY THE FARES ARE GENERATING MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND THIS IS SELF IDENTIFYING SALES TAX IT WASN'T EVEN WASN'T EVEN THE FORM THAT ACTUALLY TRACKED IT WAS SELF IDENTIFY -- SO IT'S A GREAT INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE AND COMPLIMENTS TO THE FAIR MANAGERS -- THE PARTNER FOOD AGRICULTURE THE CALIFORNIA AFFAIRS HAVE BEEN ABLE. TO ONE STAY IN EXISTENCE. BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO THE THESE TYPES OF EMERGENCIES YOU'VE HEARD A COMMON THREAD OF VETERINARY SERVICES. BEFORE THE COMMON THREAD OF OF HOW TO HANDLE ANIMALS. AND THAT THAT LITTLE LEGAL AGREEMENT WE CAME UP WITH WE'VE SHARED WITH PARTLY FOOD AGRICULTURE THEY'VE SURE THAT NOW WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER FAIRS. TRYING TO PROTECT THE FAIR FROM AN ANIMAL THAT HURT SOMEBODY ELSE BECAUSE THE LAWSUIT GOES BACK TO THE FAIR AND TO THE FAIRS INSURANCE COVER. COVER -- IT DOESN'T GO -- TO YES WERE FOOD NAG SO THAT'S A COMMON THREAD -- YES ESTABLISHES AN OFFICIAL CAST MEMBER WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS AND YOU HAVE TO TRACKING NATURALLY TRACK YOUR EXPENSES TIED TO THAT TASK NUMBER. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT TASK NUMBER YOU HAVE NOTHING TO CLAIM REIMBURSEMENT. FOR IF YOU START A COUPLE OF DAYS AHEAD OF TIME GETTING READY. YOU CAN'T RECOVER COST INTO THE YOU HAVE A TASK NUMBER IN HAND. OTHER BECAUSE OF OUR LOCATIONS MANY TIMES WERE ASKED TO OPEN UP OR GET READY TO OPEN UP. AND WE WILL BE OPEN WITH PEOPLE THERE AND NOT HAVE IT TASK NUMBER. NOW WITH CLEARLY UNDERSTAND IN THE SCOPE OF CONCERNS AND PRIORITIES DEALING WITH POTENTIAL LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY -- YES FOOD NAG AND EVERYONE ELSE WAS FOCUSED ON THE CRISIS BUT IT A FAIR THAT THEN HAS TO COME UP WITH A WAY. TO PAY FOR THINGS. OF WE SCRATCH OUR HEADS AND GO AWAY I HOPE WE CAN GET REIMBURSED ON US. SO A NUMBER OF THE COLLECTIVE PHONE CALLS WE'VE HAD WITH FOOD NAG AND ALL WE ESOS. OKAY NOW HOW DO WE HAVE TO TRACK THIS AND HOW CAN WE SUBMIT IT TO YOU AND HOW QUICK CAN WE GET REIMBURSED BECAUSE OUR CASH FLOW MAKES A WORLD. AND PAYS THE INSURANCE PREMIUMS -- SO GOOD THINGS IN CASE THE STATE FAIR NINETY TWO OFFICES OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY HAVE COME OUT TO VISIT US. IN THE LAST TWO YEAR FACT SEVERAL OF YOUR MEMBERS PLAYED SOCCER NOT TOO LONG AGO AT CAL EXPO. IT'S GOING TO CONGRATULATE THE WINNING TEAM. ALL THE TEAMS. ONE AND TWO TO THE OFFICE. ALMOST EVERY OFFICE STAFF MEMBER THAT COMES OUT SAYS. NO YOU GUYS ARE FULLY FUNDED BY THE STATE YOUR STATE AGENCY THIS IS STATE LAND. AND WE START WALKING HIM THROUGH SOME OF THE THINGS WE SHOULD CREEK SHARED WITH YOU AND YOUR GRACIOUSLY ALLOWED US TO TIME TO DO THAT. AND THEY SHAKE THEIR HEAD ANGLE HOW ARE YOU STILL IN EXISTENCE AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE WON'T BE. THIS MODEL FOR ALL THE FAIRS CANNOT BE SUSTAINABLE VERY FAR INTO THE FUTURE WITHOUT SOME TYPE OF A FUNDING MECHANISM TO SUPPORT HIM. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF OF MOVING US UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS ARE MOVING A SOMEWHERE ELSE. THERE WE REALIZE THE STATE HAS A NUMBER OF FISCAL ITEMS TO DEAL WITH. AND WE'RE NOT SAYING WE'RE BETTER THAN EDUCATION OUR ROADS OUR PRISONS ARE ANY OF THOSE THINGS WE'RE JUST SAYING SUDDENLY BECAUSE WE'VE STEPPED INTO THE SUMMER AGENCY SERVICES ROLE -- HEY REMEMBER US TOO AND THE FACT THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US SO MUCH YOUR TIME TODAY THANK YOU. WE WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT. OKAY SO. I'M SO COMMON THEMES. GOD REQUEST NOT TAKING ANIMALS. PROBLEM AS SOME KIND OF STRIKE TEAM THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE -- TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY AS NEEDED. MORE MONEY MORE MONEY. MORE MONEY. LOCATION OKAY. YEAH THAT SOME MOST OF IT UP YES I THINK SO AND AND I I THINK ALSO -- IS I MENTIONED EARLIER IT MAYBE THERE'S A DEDICATED PERSON ARE SOMEWHAT DEDICATED PERSON WITHIN CDFA THAT OVER WOULD OVERSEE EVACUATIONS AND COORDINATE WITH FAIRS WITH -- YES BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A GAP THERE -- YOU KNOW CLEARLY THERE'S A LOT OF OPERATIONAL ISSUES AND AND I WAS VERY. CAUTIOUS NOT TO COME IN WITH A WHOLE LIST OF THESE THIS IS TERRIBLE AND THIS HAPPENED TO THIS WAS AWFUL BECAUSE A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS REALLY DO HAPPEN THOSE ACTIVATIONS -- BUT THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES AND I DO THINK WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER WITH CAT YOU KNOW WITH CALLAWAY YES AND CAL FIRE. AND THE FAIR NETWORK AND REALLY COME TOGETHER AS A REAL STRONG TEA. OKAY. I THINK IT'S AN INDUSTRY WE HAVE -- BECAUSE WERE BOOTS ON THE GROUND THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S EVEN MORE WE COULD HAVE ADDED TO THIS THE DONATIONS THAT FLOODED IN IN THOSE TIMES -- AND HOW HOW THAT GETS MANAGED OR OR HASN'T BEEN MANAGER THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WE CAN JUST CONTRIBUTE -- IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS WERE IT'S REALLY AN OCC A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT ALL THAT'S TAKING PLACE -- ON ON OUR FACILITIES IN THE QUE AND WHETHER IT HAPPENS AT OUR FACILITIES ARE HAPPENS AT A HIGH SCHOOL OR CHURCH THE GETS ENGAGED I THINK YOU WERE SEEN SOME. OTHER COMMONALITIES WITHIN EVACUATIONS AS WELL OF THE VALLEY FIRE THE NUMBER OF DONATIONS THAT CAME INTO BECAUSE THEY AREN'T NEW BRAND NEW AND BRAND NEW PACKAGING -- WERE TURNED AWAY BY RED CROSS -- IN THE END AFTER HOSTING APPROXIMATELY. AVERAGE OUT ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED PEOPLE A NIGHT FOR FOURTEEN DAYS AND THEN TAKING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THEY WANTED -- THROUGH -- YOU PS -- WE HE AND ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THE CENTER FOR VOLUNTEER NONPROFIT LEADERSHIP WE'RE ABLE TO COORDINATE WITH THEM ABOUT. THIRTY THE BIGGEST LONGEST SEMIS THE CALIFORNIA ALLOWS FULLY STOCKED WITH THE DONATIONS THAT WERE STILL LEFT ON OUR LITTLE SEVENTY ACRE FAIR GROUNDS -- THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO STORE IN HOUSE FOR THE FUTURE NEEDS OF LAKE COUNTY AND AND NOT FIRE SO THEY'D SO DONATION MANAGEMENT THE ANIMAL MANAGEMENT THE LIVESTOCK MANAGEMENT OF IT JUST WE'VE WITNESSED A LOT -- AS AN INDUSTRY THAT WE'VE SHARED WITH ONE ANOTHER AND I THINK WE'RE READY TO SHARE THAT WITH EVERYONE. TO WHICH WOULD YOU AND I BECAUSE I ASKED THE THE DEPARTMENT FOLKS WHAT WHAT WITH THE OVER THE COUNTER WITH THE FEAR PEOPLE SAY IS THERE BUT THEY DO TO THE BEST OF WHAT THEY NEED THE MOST HELP WITH. SO I WOULD SAY. A WHAT WE DO THE BEST IS IS IS EVENTS. AND OF OF DECORATION IS LIKE A LARGE EVENT YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE YOU'RE FEEDING PEOPLE. YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF JANITORIAL YOU'RE DOING ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT YOU DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A LARGE FAIR YOU HAVE A LARGE IN TERMS OF THAT -- WHAT WE HAVEN'T DONE IS HAVE PEOPLE STAY OVERNIGHT HAVE YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STAY OVERNIGHT AT YOUR FACILITY? SO THAT'S DEFINITELY BEEN A A LEARN A BIG LEARNING CURVE. AND THEN -- THE INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK THAT'S WHERE CHALLENGES IS THAT REALLY IS IS IS SUPPORTING THAT IN. HE'S FROM FAIRGROUNDS TO FAIRGROUNDS DEL MAR BUDGETS EVERY YEAR FOR AT LEAST WHEN I WAS THERE WAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EVERY YEAR JUST A SPIN ON EVACUATION SEPARATE FAIR WILL. MOST FAIRS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT -- REIMBURSEMENT -- WE SENT A A BILL TO A RED CROSS FOR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A YEAR LATER WE GOT A NOTE BACK THAT SAID THANK YOU FOR YOUR DONATION. SO YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT FINANCIAL ASPECT OF IT BUT I THINK IT YOU KNOW AS A WHOLE I THINK WE DO AN AMAZING JOB. OF THE FAIR NETWORK OF HAVING THAT TEAM TO PRODUCE AND TO DO IT PUT AN EVENT ON THIS EVACUATION OF AT WHAT WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IS IS HAVE THE STRENGTH IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND HOW ABOUT FOR THE STATE BUT THE STATE AGENCIES WHAT COULD THEY DO BETTER AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY DO REALLY WELL I THINK IT'S A COORDINATION I THINK IT'S THE UNDERSTANDING -- I KNOW THAT -- CDFA THROUGH F. ANY REALLY TRIED OTHER BEST A STATE CERTAINLY DURING OUR FIRES TO STAY CONNECTED WITH ALL OF OF OF ALL THE FAIRS -- BUT I THINK BETTER COORDINATION AND UNDERSTANDING. BETWEEN -- CALLAWAY US AND CDFA AND AFFAIRS AS TO WHAT RE REALLY NEED BECAUSE I KNOW THERE WERE CHALLENGES WHEN WE CALLED F. ANY IT CDFA INSIDE CAM. CALLOWAY US DO THIS AND THEY WERE SO. BOGGED DOWN BY DEALING WITH ALL THE OTHER FAIRS YOU KNOW RESPONSE WAS DIFFICULT TO GET BACK NOT TO SAY THEY WERE TRYING THEIR BEST IT'S JUST. IT'S JUST KIND OF THE OPERATIONAL AND STAFFING INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK IS A CHALLENGE -- I WOULD PART I WOULD ECHO THAT AND SAY THAT WOULD -- WHAT WE DO REALLY WELL AS WE SERVE? WE SERVE PEOPLE I MEAN THERE WERE PUBLIC SERVANTS I'M JUST LIKE YOU ARE AND AND WE SERVE REALLY WELL AS AN AS AN INDUSTRY -- WE'RE IN AN INDUSTRY THAT'S A VERY MUCH ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF READING PEOPLE AND AND THEIR NEEDS AND THEN IT ENDED AND ADJUSTING TO THAT -- YOU KNOW HUMAN BEHAVIORS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO WE HAVE AN INNATE ABILITY TO QUICKLY RESPOND TO THEIR NEEDS. ON THE SIDE OF OF WHAT WE NEED YES IT'S IT'S MONEY -- YOU KNOW IT'S FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE BUT I THINK ALSO TRAINING AND I THINK AS FAR AS THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES IT'S REALLY THE FAIRGROUNDS INDUSTRY. FALLS IN THE PRE PLANNING EFFORTS AS WELL -- SOMETIMES THERE'S THERE IT BECOMES CONFUSION OR OF THE LINES IN THE BOUNDARIES IS THIS THE DA IS THIS ACCOUNT E. FAIRGROUNDS IS THIS THE CITRUS FAIRGROUNDS WHO REALLY HAS THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY TO ACTIVATE THAT PARTICULAR SITE -- WHO KNOWS IT BEST AND BESIDES US AND I THINK THERE ARE ALSO REALLY INCREDIBLE -- TRAININGS AND STRUCTURES WITHIN CAL WE **** AND WITHIN CAL FIRE AND THEIR SYSTEM THAT WE USE THE FAIRGROUNDS COULD LEARN BECOME A PART OF THOSE TRAININGS -- ADAPT TO SO THAT OUR SYSTEMS PLUG AND PLAY WITH VERY WELL TOGETHER -- YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE SOARING OUT DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY WE'RE STRUCTURED IN THAT SAME WAY. HI I'M I WOULD BE A BROKEN RECORD SAY ALMOST ALL THE SAME THINGS -- BEING INCLUDED IN THE PLANNING PROCESS GOING FORWARD -- ARE FOR GRANTED NEVER BEEN CALLED INTO PLAY. WE LEARNED A LOT I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS WE EXPERIENCE MIGHT NOT BE MIGHT BE THE RELATIVELY UNCOMMON THING. AND WE DON'T KNOW THE ACCESS ALL IN COMMON US BUT BUT IF WE'RE USES A CASE STUDY RIGHT NOW BEFORE WE ALL FORGET WHAT HAPPENED -- THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE REALLY VALUABLE TO OTHER SMALL. RURAL FAIRS THAT DON'T FAIRGROUNDS THAT DON'T HAVE. DEEP POCKETS DON'T HAVE. EXTRA PIECE OF EQUIPMENT LINE OR WHATEVER. IF WHAT I WOULD HOPE TO DO ONE THING I APPLIED FOR A MOMENT WE HAVE GOT A GRANT FOR IT YET WAS TO ACTUALLY. GET SOME FUNNY TO HAVE A PROFESSIONAL EMERGENCY PLAN DONE FOR OUR GROUNDS. SO WE CAN TURN AROUND WITH WITH THAT EXAMPLE IN PLACE AND THEN SURE WITH THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY HALF OF THE FAIRGROUNDS THAT WOULD GO -- THERE'S SOME REALLY GOOD COMMON SENSE STUFF TO COME OUT OF THIS IN THE SUMMER LIKE JUST KNOWING THE CALLING AND SAID. TWO YEARS AGO SAYING JUST YOU KNOW -- UNDERGROUND LIKE YOU DO WITH FEDERAL. IF YOU IF I DIDN'T HAVE THAT RINGING IN MY EARS WE WOULD ADD A PROBLEM THERE AND AND THAT'S THAT'S A PLACE WHERE I THINK WE CAN REALLY. SCORE SOME POINTS WITHIN THE WITHIN THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS IF. IF GALLO YES WAS INVOLVED IN THAT RECROSS WAS A MODEL THAT AND THE ANIMAL SHELTER PEOPLE INVOLVED AND YOU SEE DAVIS. COME UP WITH ONE PLAN FOR ONE PLACE AND THEN OTHERS CAN USE AS A MODEL AND ADAPT FROM. BOTTOM LINE WHERE EVENT PEOPLE. FOR PUBLIC SERVICE -- WERE INTO FOOD PREP FOOD HEALTH AND SAFETY TOILETS EIGHTY A LOGISTICS LAY OUT THE OVERNIGHT IS A WRINKLE THE DRUG USE OR MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES ARE RECALL. THE TRAUMA COUNSELING FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING IN THAT OF LOST EVERYTHING IS NOT A SKILL SET OF OURS AT ALL. OUR VETERINARY SERVICES TYPICALLY ARE GEARED MORE TOWARD REGULATIONS FOR COMPETITIVE ANIMALS. OUR VET SERVICES TYPICALLY ART GEARED TOWARD A RESCUE ANIMAL PER SE. SO THOSE TYPES OF THINGS BE VERY HELPFUL. AND A HUGE HUGE COMPLIMENT TO FOOD NAG N. TWO OH YES AND CAL FIRE CLOSER DOING SO MANY THINGS RIGHT SO WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WANT TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT. THE SKY HAS FALLEN AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I THINK MOST OF US ARE SAYING WE'RE CONTINUING TO BUILD THIS AIRPLANE WALLETS AND FLIGHT. GET GOOD KNOWLEDGE. AND NOW I JUST REAL QUICK WITH THE WORKING WITH LOOKING AT MENTAL HEALTH AND DRUG AND TRAUMA AND ALL THAT. HOW I MEAN ARE YOU WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES WITHOUT A DOOR VOLUNTEERS ARE WHO IS PROVIDING THE SERVICES AND I GUESS WHAT'S THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY? IT JUST DEPENDS. IT REALLY DOES SO -- IN OUR IN OUR CASE IN SNOW AS WE WORKED WITH -- CATHOLIC CHARITIES THAT CAME IN AND WERE VERY HELPFUL WITH OUR OUR HOMELESS FOLKS -- IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE WITH OF FOLKS THAT ARE IN THE FEMA TRAILERS BECAUSE FAMOUS NOT SKILLED IN THAT AREA EITHER -- SO WE HAVE WORKED THROUGH VARIOUS AGENCIES TO TRY TO WORK WITH SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A PARTICULAR WHAT HAD PARTICULAR WOMAN THAT WAS ON THE VERGE OF ALZHEIMER'S AND STARTING TO YOU KNOW GO DOWN THAT PATH -- SO YOU KNOW THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THOSE CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS A DEAL WITH THAT HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL. COUNTY HELPED US -- WE ARE COUNTY FACILITY SO THE COUNTIES HELP US WITH SOME OF THAT BUT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT. THAT NEED TO BE IN THIS MIX -- BECAUSE IT IT'S IT'S IT'S PREVALENT IN EVERY SINGLE EVACUATION. ANY KIND OF TRAUMA IS GOING TO BRING UP I MEAN FOR YOUR PEOPLE RIGHT YEAH GE RIGHT AND IN THE CASE OF CALISTOGA IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THAT PART OF WHAT -- SO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER I'M DISPATCH BASICALLY OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TEAM AND DISPATCHED OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TEAMS AND THEY WENT THROUGH AND MET WITH. A REPRESENTATIVE -- FOR ANY FAMILY AND DID A QUé OF FULL HEALTH ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE BECAUSE IT WHAT IS IT YOU KNOW A FEW DAYS INTO IT YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THE SIGNS AND YOU AREN'T SURE. AND ESPECIALLY AGAIN WHEN PEOPLE HAVE LEFT WITH NOTHING THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE MEDICATIONS WITH THEM EVEN. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T ILLEGAL DRUG USERS -- BUT YOU KNOW GETTING THEIR THEIR MEDICATIONS TO THEM AND THE RIGHT ONES AND YET THEY DON'T HAVE ID. NECESSARILY THEY HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW -- WHO THEY ARE MAIL SERVICE WHAT'S THE PROBLEM -- HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO GET THEIR MAIL WITHOUT AN ID THAT SAYS THAT THEY ACTUALLY LIVE AT THAT ADDRESS IT'S WHERE YOU KNOW THE FRAUD AND THINGS LIKE THAT COME INTO PLAY -- BUT I THINK -- WITHIN THE INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN -- ENGAGED IN THESE YOU KNOW EVACUATIONS IN SHELTERS IN THAT THE RECENT YEARS -- THERE ARE SOME MORE INTEGRATED RESOURCES AND IT INVOLVES EVERYTHING FROM COMMUNITY AND NONPROFIT GROUPS TO OUR LOCAL YOU KNOW COUNTY SERVICES -- AND THEN AS THE FAIRGROUNDS REALLY JUST THE HOST OF THAT AND WORKING WITH THEM IF FOLKS NEED TO BE MOVED AROUND CREATING QUIET SPACE -- WE HAD AND SOME INCIDENTS ARE YOU WE HAD SOME AUTISTIC CHILDREN AND AND ADULTS THAT WERE STAYING THERE AND CREATING SPACE IS NO SENSORY SPACE FOR THEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE NEWER ISSUES THAT HAVE HAVE COME TO LIGHT THAT AGAIN I THINK JUST OUR INCLUSION IN YOUR PRE PLANNING EFFORTS -- TO REALLY BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT AND AND MEDICAL WE REALLY HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THAT -- I KNOW IN DEL MAR WE IT WILL WAS REALLY DAYS BEFORE HE REALLY GOT INTO STRONG MEDICAL TEAM AND THAT A FRIEND THAT'S A PHARMACIST AND WE WERE. SHE WAS LIKE WORKING WITH PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE THEIR WHODID HAVE THE PRESCRIPTIONS AND SAID OKAY. HERE'S WHAT YOUR MEDICATION IS WE CAN WERE HERE'S WHAT WE GOT WE GOT BETTER AFTER A WE DON'T HAVE WHATEVER THIS IS WE CAN YOU KNOW WORK THAT COMPOUND THAT AROUND TO MAKE IT WORK -- IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES AND SONOMA -- MY PARTNER ACTUALLY IS A PHYSICIAN AND SHE WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO BE ON VACATION THAT WEEK. WORKS FOR KAISER AND CAME AND BOTH OF US WERE IN MY OFFICE SLIPPED MY OFFICE FOR SEVEN DAYS BUT SHE WAS COORDINATING MEDICAL THERE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE IN. AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE SITUATIONS IS MOST LIKELY. THIS ROOM. IF YOU'RE AN EVACUATION YOU WOULDN'T GO TO AN EVACUATION CENTER YOU HAVE FRIENDS AND FAMILY HAVE THE MEANS TO RENT A HOTEL ROOM OR SOMETHING. SO THE PEOPLE THAT END IN THESE BUT END UP IN THESE EVACUATION SITES ARE MORE THE OF ME NO MORE DISTRESSED FAMILIES OR THE LOWER INCOME MORE PEOPLE WITHOUT HAVING YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE ANY CONNECTIONS AND AND AND THEIR NEEDS ARE MORE. AND MORE CHALLENGING BUT I DO HAVE A GOOD STORY WOULD LIKE TO END WITH SO IT WAS A COUPLE DAYS INTO EVACUATION WE HAD ABOUT A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN OUR LARGE HALL. AND PART OF THE PROBLEM I DID TALK ABOUT -- RED CROSS QUICKLY IS THAT THEY WON'T GIVE THE NAMES OF ANYBODY THAT'S IN THERE OF ACTUATION CENTER. SO IN THE FIRST DAY WHEN THE FIRES ARE ALL AROUND STE US NUMBER COUNTY AND SO MANY PEOPLE ARE REGULATED LOVE WHEN YOU'RE CALLING US. OUR PHONES WERE RINGING OFF THE HOOK TRYING TO FIND PEOPLE WHO WERE IN EVACUATION CENTER AND WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY NAMES SO. IT TOOK A COUPLE DAYS FOR THIS. THIS GAL TO FIND HER MOTHER IN A REGULATION SITE SO SHE SHOWED P THEN SHE SAID MOM YOU KNOW THEY'LL BE YOU KNOW HUG AND EVERYTHING AND SHE SAID OKAY LET'S GO WHICH SAID NO COME BACK TOMORROW HAVING TOO MUCH FUN. SO THERE ARE SOME POSITIVE STORIES WITH THINGS THAT YOU KNOW THAT HAPPENED AT THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORK THANK YOU FOR YOUR THANK YOU FOR YEARS WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. AND OUR FINAL PANEL IS GOING TO BE -- HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD TO ENSURE FAIRS CAN CONTINUE? TO BE STRONG PARTNERS WITH LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL EMERGENCIES. DEAR SERVICES DURING DISASTERS AND I THINK WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT ALREADY. MICHAEL PARKS BOARD MEMBER FOURTH. DISTRICT AB SNOW MY COUTY. CONLIN CALIFORNIA FAIRS ALIGNS FROM DIXON CLIFF MUNSON -- FROM SISKIYOU AND KEVIN CON -- FROM THE ROLE REPRESENTATIVE CALIFORNIA. WELCOME THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- VERY HONORED TO BE HERE AND BE A PART OF THIS TODAY -- CAN'T HELP BUT EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE AND PRIDE FOR THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS OF OUR INDUSTRY THAT HAVE GONE BEFORE THEY'VE DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB TACK COMMUNICATING EXACTLY WHAT GOES ON IN THESE PROPERTIES. AS YOU MENTION MY NAME IS MIKE PARKS I'M WITH THE CINEMA MARIN FAIRGROUNDS I AM A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. PROBABLY SOMETIMES A LITTLE UNIQUE TO HAVE A BOARD MEMBER I SPEAK IN THIS CAPACITY BUT I HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE BOTH WITH THAT FARE. AS WELL AS IN THE FAIR INDUSTRY MYSELF. IT'S BEEN MY HONOR TO SERVE ON THAT BOARD AND I I'VE HEARD A LOT OVER. BOTH THE ABOUT THE LAST FIVE SIX YEARS AS OUR NATURAL DISASTERS HAVE KIND OF RUN ROUGHSHOD OVER THIS COUNTRY. IS UNPRECEDENTED EVENTS. WE HAD A WHOLE LOT OF UNPRECEDENTED EVENTS OCCUR OVER THE LAST SIX SEVEN YEARS ALL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. YOU'VE HEARD -- ALL OVER THE MAP ENCOMPASSING DIFFERENT STORIES ON WHAT'S HAPPENED ON PROPERTIES BIG AND SMALL -- FACILITIES THAT HAVE -- PREPARED PLANS THAT JUST WEREN'T BIG ENOUGH IN FACILITIES THAT HAD NO PREPARED PLANS ARE PROPERTY AND PETALUMA WHERE THE SNOW MARIN FAIR BUT WE OCCUPY SPACE IN PETALUMA. AND WE HAD NEVER BEEN AN EVACUATION CENTER BEFORE WE'D ONLY BEEN A STAGING GROUNDS. AND SO -- WHEN THE FIRES HIT ON? SUNDAY OCTOBER EIGHTH OUR FIRST NINTH -- WE HAD A COUPLE EMPLOYEE SHOW UP HI JUST BECAUSE THEY FELT LIKE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO OPEN THE GATES AND WE BECAME ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVACUATION CENTERS IN THE AREA. NEXT TO THE CINEMA COUNTY FAIR WE HAVE TAKEN A LOT OVERFLOW -- I SECURED MY FAMILY AND WENT DOWN TO ASSIST OUR CEO -- IT BECAME VERY APPARENT THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING. WE HEAR A LOT OF THE APPRECIATION FOR FAIRS AND ARE ASKED YOU KNOW HOW DID YOU DO IT. THE THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS WE WE GO FAIR. THAT'S IT THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT WE DO. WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO PREPARE. AND WE NEED THESE RESOURCES WE NEED THESE FACILITIES TO BE UPGRADED SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE THIS FOR THE COMMUNITY. WHEN WE OPENED ON OCTOBER NINTH -- WE HAD JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE SCOPE OF OF SIZE WE HAD A DORMITORY WITH THREE HUNDRED BEDS -- YES GODDESSES BEDS VERY QUICKLY -- WE HAD -- DUE -- TO THE VERY LARGE HEART OF A LOCAL NURSE WHO DID NOT HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO THAT DAY BECAUSE TWO OF THE FOUR LOW QUERY HOSPITAL'S READER ON FIRE OR EVACUATED. SO SHE SHOWED UP AND STARTED TO PUT TOGETHER A TRIAGE AREA WHICH QUICKLY TURNED INTO. BASICALLY A MAKESHIFT URGENT CARE THAT RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT MUCH MORE THAN A FAIR GROUNDS OR EVEN A RED CROSS SHELTER -- WOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE AS FAR AS MEDICAL ISSUES ARE CONCERNED. WE ARE EVEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH -- TWENTY BEDS WITH IN THIS MEDICAL FACILITY AND A SEPARATE FIFTY BAD QUARANTINE AREA JUST IN CASE OR USE FOR THE ELDERLY THAT MAY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL NEEDS. A CAFETERIA FEEDING OVER TWO THOUSAND MEALS IT WAS MENTIONED JUST PRIOR -- THESE ARE NOT SEEN CUISINES OUT OF THE FREEZER -- THE OUTPOURING FOR THE COMMUNITY IS SIGNIFICANT AND WE ATE LIKE ROYALTY -- THEY DID A FANTASTIC JOB IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THAT -- THAT TYPE OF SUPPORT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO MANAGE LOGISTICALLY WHEN THAT AMOUNT OF PREPARED FOOD SHOWS UP TO FEED YOUR CREW. AND WHEN I SAY CREW WE'VE GOT -- YOU KNOW THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TO FOUR HUNDRED EVACUEES AND BEDS YOU HAVE PROBABLY DOUBLE THAT IN VOLUNTEERS. HOW DO YOU MANAGE ALL THAT? VERY SIGNIFICANT UNDERTAKING ANIMAL EVACUATION CENTER WITH COMPLETE THAT MONITORING AND BIO SECURITY HUGE ISSUE ONLY FAIRS CAN DO THAT. JUST PLAIN AND SIMPLE ONLY FAIRS CAN DO THAT -- IT WAS MENTIONED BEFORE -- THAN SOME OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPECIES -- YOU HAVE YOUR NORMAL COWS HORSES SHEEP GOATS BUT I ALSO WANTED TO ADD IN AS WELL YAKS [inaudible] THE MOOSE. THESE ARE PEOPLE'S FAMILY. AND THEY NEED A PLACE TO GO. TO I ON OUR SPECIFIC PROPERTY -- AS WE WERE NOT A AS AS LARGE AS OUR SISTER FAIR AND SANTA ROSA SONOMA COUNTY FAIR -- FOR US ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE BECAME DONATIONS AND YOU HEARD THIS BEFORE. WE HAD A CONSTANT FLOW FOR THE TEN DAYS THAT WE WERE OPEN FOR EVACUATION FOR PEOPLE MUCH LONGER FOR ANIMALS WE HAD AT LEAST. DROPPING DONATIONS OFF WE HAD CARAVANS OF U. HAUL TRUCKS FROM A CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WE HAVE STOCK TRAILERS WE HAVE EVERYTHING -- THE HEARTS OPENED UP THE PURSES OPENED UP. BUT IT WAS WAY TOO MUCH THERE WAS A LOT FOR US TO MANAGE AN OUT REACH IN WHAT THE PUBLIC CAN PROVIDE AT THOSE TIMES. YOU NEVER WANT TO SAY NO THANK YOU TO ANYTHING WHEN SOMEONE'S DONATING IT BUT THE SHEER LOGISTICS BEHIND THIS WE HAD DISCUSSIONS BEFORE ABOUT FORKLIFTS AND GARBAGE YOU'RE DEALING WITH PERISHABLE PRODUCTS WE SHOWED UP ONE DAY AND THAT WAS A PALETTE OF BANANAS. A FULL POWER TO BAN IS -- AND AND WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT HOW LONG IS IT GOOD FOR AND WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THAT THE MANAGING THE LOGISTICS IS JUST. JUST STAGGERING -- WE WE WERE ABLE -- TO PUT TOGETHER -- TO TO THE LAY OF THE LAND OF OUR PROPERTY WE ARE ABLE TO SEPARATE OUT ARE EVACUEES FROM DONATIONS WE'RE ABLE TO DO TRAFFIC CONTROL READ RECEIVE TREMENDOUS HELP. FROM THE COAST GUARD THEY WERE ABLE TO DO TRAFFIC CONTROL FOR US FOR A WHILE THEY WERE ALSO ABLE TO HELP US. PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF POLICING IN THE DORMITORIES -- AND THIS IS BEFORE RED CROSS SHOWED UP BECAUSE WE WERE NOT A PREDETERMINED RED CROSS SHELTER IN FACT THEY CAME MUCH MUCH LATER. SO WE UTILIZED -- COAST GUARD IN PLAIN CLOTHES AS TO NOT. DISRUPT DISTURB SCARE ANY OF THE EVACUEES WE UTILIZED AN ARMED -- NATIONAL GUARD FOR OUR PERIMETERS AND PULLED THEM BACK. WE HAD -- OBVIOUSLY SHERIFFS AND POLICE AS WELL -- BUT WE WERE ABLE TO USE ALL THOSE ENTITIES TO KIND OF MASSAGE THE SITUATION MANAGE HOMELESS WHICH WERE DEFINITELY WELCOME. MANAGE ANY SORT OF EMOTIONAL ISSUES -- MEDICAL ISSUES AND SUCH BUT WE WE WE DID MANAGE IT BUT IT IS A MASSIVE TASK -- WE WERE ABLE TO PUT ON THINGS LIKE CHILDREN'S ACTIVITIES INFANT CARE AREAS MOBILE CLOTHES WASHING OFFER A A MEETINGS FOR THOSE THAT NEEDED IT -- FROM A MANAGEMENT STANDPOINT WE TALKED ABOUT -- STAFF BURN OUT AND MANAGING THAT TYPE OF ALL HIM WE WERE VERY LUCKY THAT THE C. E. O. OF THE LAKE COUNTY FAIR WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH OUR PROPERTY AND SHE CAME DOWN. AND ACTUALLY RAN GRAVEYARD SHIFT FROM US SO WE HAD A CEO WITH A A BOARD MEMBER AND THE ENTIRE TIME. AND THE CEO'S JOB IS TO MANAGE THE PROPERTY THE BOARD MEMBER WAS A JOB WITH THE BOARD MEMBERS JOB SKEWS ME WAS TO PROTECT THE PROPERTY. AND HELP MANAGE THE OUTSIDE ENTITIES. IT BECAME VERY APPARENT THAT. RED CROSS WAS NOT EXACTLY ON ITS WAY REMEMBER -- AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE ARE ALSO ON THE BACK OF THE FIRES IN THE MIDWEST. AS WELL AS HURRICANES -- DOWN IN TEXAS AND IN THE EAST COAST. IT WAS OCTOBER AND TOWARDS THE END OF THE SEASON RED CROSS WAS OUT THEY DID NOT HAVE AS AS WE WERE NOT A PRE PLANNED LOCATION THEY DID NOT HAVE STAFF TO SEND TO US -- I WAS ABLE TO MAKE A CALL TO A RETIRED RED CROSS SHELTER MANAGER AN EVACUATION SERVICES FOR THE COUNTY TO COME DOWN AND ASSISTANCE JUST TO KIND OF LAY THINGS DOWN BEFORE WE GOT TO DEEP -- AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE OURSELVES INTO A CORNER. SHE WAS ABLE TO HELP -- ALLOW US TO SEPARATE OUT THE COMMUNITY ALLOW US TO KEEP PEOPLE HEALTHY AND LET US KNOW WHAT RED CROSS WE WOULD DO AND WHAT DOESN'T DO AND I THINK THAT'S A COMMON THEME HERE IS EDUCATION FROM DIFFERENT -- EMERGENCY SERVICES INCLUDING RED CROSS AND ANY OTHER ENTITIES OF WHAT EXACTLY THEY CAN DO AND CANNOT DO WE HEARD ABOUT ANIMALS. MEDICAL CARE THEY HAVE LIMITATIONS ON MEDICAL CARE AS WELL HE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THE MEDICAL CARE THAT WE WERE OFFERING FAR EXCEEDED RED CROSS AND WE NEEDED TO GET THEM TO NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE. PHONE CALLS WITH NEW JERSEY THEIR HEADQUARTERS SO ON AND SO FORTH -- SO. UNDERSTANDING WHAT EACH ENTITY CAN AND CANNOT DO IS EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT AS UNDERSTANDING WHAT EACH FACILITY CAN AND CANNOT DO -- GOING BACK TO THOSE DONATIONS WE MAXED OUT ALL THE LOCAL CHARITIES -- WE WERE SENDING TRUCKLOADS FIFTY THREE FOOT SEMI TRUCK LOADS -- PILOTED BY MEMBERS OF THE TEAMSTERS THAT SHOWED UP IN FULL FORCE AND WE WERE SENDING IN AS FAR AWAY AS SANTA CLARA TRACY STOCKED AND JUST TO FILL OUT THE LOCAL -- THE LOCAL CHARITIES -- WHEN IT BECAME TIME FOR LAKE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS TO BE ACTIVATED AS A SHELTER WE PUT TOGETHER A TRUCK COMPLETELY STOCKED WITH EVERYTHING THEY NEED AND SET IT UP THERE BEFORE EVEN THE CEO COULD GET THERE -- AS WE TALKED ABOUT AS FAR AS RESOURCES IN MY EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES -- THE IT IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION AND WE'RE WILLING TO DO WHATEVER BUT THE FAIRGROUNDS IS LEFT THERE TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER AFTER. TWO YEARS LATER AFTER THE TUBS FIRE IN -- CINEMA COUNTY WE STILL HAVE COSTS WE STILL HAVE DAMAGE WE STILL HAVEN'T INFRASTRUCTURE DECLINE -- THAT IS TAKING A LONG TIME TO PUT BACK TOGETHER SO. FOR THE FOLKS THAT RUSHED TO THE AID. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THEY GET ATTENTION TO MAKE THEM SO STEM CELLS HOLE AFTER. I THINK THE THE LAST THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS -- THIS PANEL THESE THREE PANELS THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM OUR ARE MASTERS AT LOGISTICS AND I'M NOT PUTTING MYSELF IN THAT CATEGORY THESE FAIR MANAGERS -- YES AND SO FORTH THEIR MASTERS AT LOGISTICS -- LET'S BRING THEM TO THE TABLE MORE LET'S PREPARE WITH THEM MORE -- THE STAFFS THAT THEY ARE DOING THIS WITH ARE JUST SKELETON STAFFS AND THEY'RE GOING FOR WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS AND EVEN LONGER -- ALL OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR HEART AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SUPPORT THEM AS BEST AS POSSIBLE WITH THE RESOURCES THEY NEEDED. BECAUSE I DON'T SEE THIS BECOMING -- UNPRECEDENTED. WE LIKE TO SET RECORDS THESE DAYS APPARENTLY AND I THINK WE'VE GOT A LOT OF RECENT CURRENT DATA. TO SIT DOWN TOGETHER EVERYBODY INVOLVED AND SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU I'M I'M KEVIN CAN I AM -- MARIPOSA COUNTY SUPERVISOR SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND NINE AND CURRENT BOARD MEMBER AND PREVIOUS PRESIDENT OF THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA RC RC. HEALING LISTENING TO TESTIMONY I'M I'M STARTING TO BELIEVE THAT THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE FAIR GROUNDS IS ALMOST INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO THE POPULATION OF OF SOME OF THESE COUNTIES -- IN AND YOU'LL SEE A LITTLE WHEN I I SPEAK HERE THE PRIOR TO BEING ELECTED AS COUNTY SUPERVISOR I WAS THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT IS SOMEBODY NATIONAL PARK MAJOR PART OF MARIPOSA COUNTY -- OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU HAVE THESE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS POLITICAL LINES TEND. TO MELT AWAY AND I'M REMINDED OF MY FIRST EXPERIENCE IN THE EMERGENCY WITH MARIPOSA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS -- NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WE HAD A FLOOD OF THE CENTURY AND YES SOMEBODY WHAT ALL THE ROSE IN THE ASSEMBLY WERE WIPED OUT WITHIN ABOUT EIGHT HOURS. I WE HAD NINE HUNDRED VISITORS STRANDED AND AND MORE THAN THAT OF EMPLOYEES AFTER FIVE DAYS AND BEING UNABLE TO GET THEM OUT WE HAD -- WE ACTIVATED THE MILITARY I HELICOPTER PLATOON OUT OF Là MORE NAVAL AIR BASE AND THEY SURVEYED THE SITUATION AND SAID WE HAVE TO GO TO THE MAYOR POST COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS THEIR FRESNO AIRPORT IS TOO FAR THE DAYS ARE TOO SHORT. AND THEY TWICE LET OUT FROM LA MORE AND HAD TO BE TURNED AROUND BECAUSE OF BAD WEATHER AND LIGHTNING AND AND THIS WAS AGAIN FIRST AND SECOND OF JANUARY -- E. VENTURE LEE WE CHOPPED A ROAD THROUGH GOT THE A CONVOY OUT AND GOT THAT THESE FOLKS DOWN TO THE FAIR GROUNDS WHERE THEY COULD STAGE AND AND EVENTUALLY BE ON THEIR WAY BUT A LOT OF THESE WERE SERVICE WORKERS THAT HAD TO BE. HELPED THROUGH -- EIGHT ALL THE THINGS YOU CAN IMAGINE -- OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT MONTH OR SO TO GET THEM RE SITUATED AS THE PARK STATE CLOSED FOR ABOUT FIVE MONTHS. THEY AT THE FAIRGROUNDS WAS JUST THE ABSOLUTE ONLY. THE REASONABLE LANDING AND HOUSING SPOT FOR THAT TO OCCUR BUT THESE INSTANCES HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BECOME MORE AND MORE FAMILIAR WE'VE HAD. FLOOD FIRE FLOOD FIRE -- ALMOST EACH OF THEM IS A RECORD SETTING A VAN TO OVER THE LAST JUST TWO YEARS IN MARIPOSA COUNTY -- THE FAR TOO MANY TIMES OVER THE PAST. FEW YEARS WE'VE HAD A SLEEPY SUNDAY AFTERNOON WITH A FEW PEOPLE WANDERING AROUND THE FAIRGROUNDS AND BY -- SEVEN HUNDRED THE NEXT MORNING THERE'S A THOUSAND FIREFIGHTERS STAGED ON THOSE EXACT GROUNDS YOU KNOW THAT JUST THE ABILITY TO DO THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN ORGANICALLY -- WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE IN THE RELATIONSHIPS YOU WE WE ALL EXTOLLED THE VALUE OF OUR FAIR MANAGERS [inaudible] THE THE SHIP AS A SHARE OF HUMAN SERVICES -- YES PUBLIC WORKS CAL FIRE AND MORE COMMUNICATE WITH THE FAIR GROUNDS MANAGER ON A CONSTANT BASIS IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE SURVIVE WHILE. I KNOW THAT'S NOT UNIQUE TO OUR COUNTY I CAN ASSURE THE COMMITTEE THAT THAT THAT TYPE OF COMMUNICATION HAPPENS IN IN MANY OTHER AREAS ESPECIALLY. THE RURAL COUNTY SOME SPEAKING. FOUR HERE IN IN BOARD OF SUPERVISOR MEETINGS THE MARIPOSA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS STATE OWNED. IS BEEN RE FOR FOR TWO IS SACRED GROUND -- IN MARIPOSA COUNTY AND EIGHT WHILE IT'S IT'S CRITICAL ASSET IN OUR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH EMERGENCIES. LIKE I DESCRIBED IT'S A RARE WEEKEND THAT DOESN'T HAVE A WEDDING A FUNERAL AND FFA OR LIONS CLUB FUND RAISER OTHER. SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY EVENT ON THE GROUNDS. IT JUST GENERATIONS OF MARIPOSAS OF GROWN UP ATTENDING SOCIAL AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS THERE MULTIPLE TIMES A MONTH. UNFORTUNATELY SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY IS BECOME A MENACING CLOUD HANGING OVER THE AVAILABILITY OF THE FAIR GROUNDS FOR FOR ALL THESE THESE FUNCTIONS -- WITH WHEN THE BUDGETS OF IN THE STATE BUDGETS WERE CUT -- MER POSING AND PARTICULARLY THE ROLE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY FORCED INTO THIS ON COMFORTABLE LEVEL OF BUDGET CUTTING AN ENTREPRENEUR IS SOME AND THEY THEY WEREN'T READY FOR EITHER -- MANY HAVE IN DURING A LEVEL OF ATROPHY FROM SINCE THAT TIME THAT THEY HAVE NOT RECOVERED FROM AND AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE JUST BEING ONE VERY OUTWARD -- SIGN OF OF THAT DETERIORATION. MARIPOSA COUNTY IN FOLLOWING WITH THAT SACRED LANDSCAPE -- HAS ACTUALLY APPROPRIATED AS LITTLE AS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AS MUCH AS A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR -- FOR THE PAST NUMBER OF YEARS IN ORDER TO JUST KEEP THEM SOLVENT AND ARE AT A MINIMAL LEVEL OF SERVICE TO CONTINUE. BECAUSE AS ISAID WITH THE THE MARIPOSA POPULATION HAS JUST GOTTEN FLAT OUT SCARED IN THE IN THE FIRE BUSINESS. AND THE ABILITY TO STAGE IN THE AIR RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF TOWN -- SAVES LITERALLY HOURS IN TRAVEL TIME FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS FROM THE NEXT AVAILABLE PLACES A FAR FAR INCIDENTS GET TOO LARGE THEY HAVE TO MOVE TO MERCED AND THAT'LL ADD ANOTHER. YOU KNOW OUR OUR FIFTEEN MINUTES TO THE TRAVEL TIME I MEAN WE ARE HOPEFUL WITH THE PASSAGE OF ASSEMBLYMAN GRAYSON THIS COMMITTEE STAY AB FOURTEEN NINETY NINE A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME. BENEFIT FROM THAT -- HELPING YEAH BROADBAND'S BEEN MENTIONED SECURE WATER SUPPLY WASTEWATER FACILITIES -- RC RC WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH SECRETARY ROSS AFTER THE INITIAL BUDGET CUTS ON SURVIVAL TECHNIQUES UP TO AND INCLUDING WE WERE CLOSE TO LEASING SOME OF THESE FAIR GROUNDS -- TO ENTITIES LIKE MARIPOSA COUNTY TO KEEP THEM VIABLE -- THAT THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY IN PULLING THAT AWFUL SO -- THANK YOU TALK ABOUT THE TRUCK LOADS OF THINGS THAT SHOW UP WE GOT A TRUCK LOAD OF MY PILLOWS DELIVERED. AND IT WAS LIKE FIVE THOUSAND PILLOWS THAT JUST CAME OUT OF THE BLUE TRUCK LOADS OF HEY FROM -- NEVADA OUT OF THE BLUE BECAUSE THEY HEARD WE HAD YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN THE THOUSAND FIREFIGHTERS GET TO THE FAIR GROUNDS -- FOR THE THE BIG INCIDENT THERE GREETED BY DOZENS AND DOZENS OF HORSES AND CATTLE AND LLAMAS AND AND AND YOU NAME IT AT THE FAIRGROUNDS IS JUST A YOU KNOW INDISPENSABLE PART OF THE COMMUNITY -- I I DID WANT TO JUST MAKE THE POINT OF HOW MUCH THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES. STEP UP TO THE PLATE WHEN THE FAIR GROUND IS THREATENED AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IT DOESN'T GO AWAY FROM US BUT ANY HELP WE CAN GET ALONG THOSE LINES WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. BUT BUT WE'RE NOT ASKING WITHOUT TRYING TO HELP ALSO. I WE HAVE A CABIN UP. FOUR EAST MADERA COUNTY SO I GO BY MAYOR POSE -- FAIRGROUNDS REGULARLY AND I CAN ATTEST TO HOW MUCH ACTIVITY I SEE THERE YEAH IT'S IT'S JUST A CONSTANT PART OF OUR LIFE THERE. THANK YOU. HELLO OKAY THANK YOU FOR HAVING US TODAY I'M PAT CONKLIN I'M ACTUALLY THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA FAIRS ALLIANCE I'M ALSO ON THE WESTERN FAIRS ASSOCIATION BOARD AND I'M THE MANAGER OF THE DIXON MAYFAIR -- JUST TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW ABOUT DIXON MAYFAIR BECAUSE THE ONE THING THAT HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED MUCH TO TODAY IS. THE MEDICAL FACILITY PART. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE DIXON MAYFAIR WAS EVACUATION SITE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WE HAD TO AND FORTY OF THEIR GUESTS -- DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED ADULTS COME TO THE FAIR GROUNDS -- WHERE IN SOLANO COUNTY THEY CAME FROM CINEMA COUNTY? SO THESE PEOPLE HAD BEEN EVACUATED ONCE AND THE FIRE MOVED. AND THEY HAD TO MOVE THEM AGAIN. AND THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT TAKING A SOLANO COUNTY FAIR BUT THE SMOKE WAS SO BAD THEY CAME UP THE ROAD AND GOT TO DIXON. NOW I GOT A CALL I THINK OF IT. YOU KNOW -- FOR FORTY THAT THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY. SO WE WERE PREPARING AND WE WERE HAVING A BOARD MEETING THAT NIGHT TO MY BOARD BECAME AND I SAID YOU HAVE TO HELP ME GET STUFF OUT OF THE BUILDINGS. NOW WE WERE THINKING TURN FORTY PEOPLE HOUSE WITHOUT ONE BIG BUILDING BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW OF THAT THAT ABILITIES OF THE PEOPLE COMING. SO -- ALSO IN AMBULANCES AND BOSSES AND EVERYTHING SHOWED UP AND IT WITH AN ESCORT OF C. H. P.. THEY CAME TO THE FAIRGROUNDS AND THEY WERE -- BECAUSE ALL LEVELS OF ABILITIES FOR THEIR SO OUR MAIN HOME AND THE WHOLE HOUSE PEOPLE THAT WERE ON RESPIRATORS AND HAD TO HAVE ASSISTANCE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. OUR MADDEN DINING HAD -- PEOPLE THAT WERE MORE SELF SUFFICIENT. AND THEN SERVE WITH OUR DENVER TEN HALL THEY HAD TO PUT GENERATORS ON OUR BUILDINGS BECAUSE YOU FOUND OUT TODAY WE DON'T HAVE GENERATORS -- BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE THAT EQUIPMENT GO DOWN. PEOPLE'S LIVES DEPENDED ON IT. WE HAD -- C. H. P. ON THE GROUNDS WE HAD A PHARMACY NOW WHAT'S SO FUNNY IS THEY WOULD CALL IT THEIR CAMPUS AND I CALLED THE FAIR GROUNDS AND SO WE ALL GOT ALONG AND WE'RE ACTUALLY VERY GOOD FRIENDS NOW -- BUT THEY SAY WE GOT A PUTS A STEP IN THE PHARMACY CONTINUE TO LOCKING ROOM AND I SAID YOU MEAN THE TICKET BOOTH. SO -- WE'VE MADE EVERYTHING WORK BUT WAS IT PERFECT NO. AND THAT'S ONE THING WE HAVE TO BRING THE TABLE TO IS WE NEED TO BRING A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICESINTO THIS DIALOGUE BECAUSE WHEN I'M STALKING THEM. YEAH THEY'VE THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT WHEN THEY HAVE TO EVACUATE -- WHERE THEY GONNA GO GROUP HOMES THOSE THINGS THE -- THAT WE WE HAVEN'T CONSIDERED -- AN EVACUATION SITE IS IS. HARD ENOUGH AS IT IS BUT WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE SPECIAL THINGS THERE -- YOU KNOW WE HAD TO UNDER FORTY GUESTS AND AND TWO HUNDRED OF THEIR STAFF MEMBERS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. AND THEY HAD THEY HAD A POP UP FLU SHOT AREA. BECAUSE WE WE'RE WE'RE ABOUT SICKNESS -- WE HAD. AT THAT MENTAL HEALTH CARE GIVERS FOR THE STATE EMPLOYEES. WE HAD A TALK I HAVE TO MAINTENANCE WORKERS NOW THIS IS OCTOBER SO A THAT'S THE YOU KNOW -- WE DIDN'T HAVE A LARGE STAFF AT THIS TIME BUT WE DON'T A LARGE SHOP ANYWAY THAT'S A SPACES. BUT WE HAD TO MAINTENANCE WORKERS AND ALSO IN THERE LIKE ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO CLEAN THE BATHROOMS I LIVE TWO PEOPLE WE BETTER FIGURE THIS OUT -- SO DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES BROUGHT IN THERE BECAUSE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES SERVICES. THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER SO WE HAD A DIFFERENT LEVEL WE HAD A DIFFERENT -- EXPERIENCE BUT IT YOU KNOW. THE REALITY IS WE ARE SMALL A MANY OF OUR FAIR GROUNDS ARE VERY MALL AND WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFFING HEARD THAT TODAY THE STAFF IS AN ISSUE. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE TO WORK TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY IN EVERYBODY'S EXHAUSTED. EQUIPMENTS AN ISSUE OUR FORKLIFT WITH ON ITS LAST LEG AND IT DID HAPPEN TURNING THINGS THAT WE TALKED TO SNOW MARIN ABOUT TAKING. THEY WERE GONNA READ THIS A FORKLIFT BUT WE THINK WE BORROW. THE TOURNEY MECHANISM SO WE COULD DUMP THE TRASH SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS SO TO WRAP UP BECAUSE I DON'T TAKE A LOT OF TIME BUT THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IS THE MEDICAL PART OF IT WE WERE MEDICAL FACILITY. WE CAN LET PEOPLE ON THE GROUND IT WAS VERY TO THE HOUSE ITSELF INTO WE HAD A HOUSE THE STAFF. AND MANY OF THOSE STAFF MEMBERS BLESS THEIR HEARTS THEY LOST EVERYTHING. AND THEY STILL SHOWED UP THEY DROVE THE SHOWED UP THE STATE ON THE FAIRGROUNDS INTENSE IN IN -- WE HAD M. SO TENSE AND IN OUR MAKESHIFT FACILITIES AND WHAT WE DID THEY THEY STAY THERE WE HAD NATIONAL GUARD THERE WHO SLEPT IN OUR BARNES WE HAD THE CHP THERE WE HAD EVERYBODY THERE. AND AND SPEAKING OF DONATIONS DONATIONS ARE A BLESSING BUT THEY THEY FOR US WE CAN TAKE THEM BECAUSE WE COULDN'T TAKE THOSE -- ITEMS THAT WE WERE AWARE OF AND THEN SOMETIMES FOR DONATIONS THEY CAN BE A HINDRANCE TO YOU GET A BUNCH OF STUFF DROPPED OFF THAT. YOU END UP. DISPOSING OF LATER BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE STUFF THAT PEOPLE NEED SO THAT'S THE THING SO TO WRAP UP I'D SAY WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE OF COURSE IMPROVEMENTS I DON'T CALL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE COULD TO ME WHEN I HEAR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I THINK A PAINT. YOU KNOW INFRASTRUCTURE ANY CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS I DON'T NEED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I NEED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS I NEED AN H. BACK SYSTEM SO WHEN I HAVE PEOPLE IN MY BUILDING THAT I DO HAVE MEDICAL NEEDS. THAT -- THAT THE THE AIR WILL BE GOOD AND CLEAN AND AND YOU KNOW AFTER NINETY DEGREES AND SWAMP COOLER IS JUST REALLY NOT EFFECTIVE. AND WHEN WE ARE PEOPLE IN YOUR BUILDING WITH RESPIRATORS IT'S REALLY NOT GOOD SO WE WERE LUCKY THE WEATHER HELD THEM ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS TURN ON OUR HEATER. NOW OUR HEATER IS EITHER ON OR OFF THOUGH THERE IS NO -- REAL -- THERMOSTAT ON IT AND IF THOSE JET HEATER SO YOU TURN ON A CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING ANYWAY BUT WHEN WE HAVE A CONTINUOUS MUSIC'S ALLOWED BLOOM DIES OUT ANYWAY SO MOST OF OUR OTHER EVENTS IT WAS GREAT. BUT AT THE SAID TODAY THIS IS ANOTHER EVENT FOR US AND AND WHAT WE REALLY GOT BEING AT THE TABLE TO WITH. THOSE WITH THAT -- DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER CINEMA DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE WAS THAT. YEAH WE RUN AN EVENT SO LET US HELP YOU AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET THEM THINGS THAT THE BUREAUCRACY WAS SLOWING HIM DOWN WITH LIKE. THEY GOT TO THE FAIR GROUNDS AND AND THEY HAD HELP AT THE TIME BUT THEN EVERYBODY LEFT. AND THE MANAGERS OF SIGNAL DEVELOPMENT CENTER WE'RE TRYING TO MANAGE THE PEOPLE AND HELP THE PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO MAKE AN EVACUATION CENTER.

SO WE CALL UP THEIR FAVORS AND GET SPONSORS TO TREAT THE COMICS BOXES WE GOT THOSE ALL DONATED WE GET THINGS DONATED IN EIGHT HATED O DO IT BUT WE SAID NO LET'S HELP YOU BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY. WANTED HELP YOU AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST VALUE OF A FAIR GROUNDS IS THERE COMMUNITY. PEOPLE COMING IN TO SERVICE EVACUATION CENTER ARE REALLY FROM THE COMMUNITY. AND WE KNOW WHO WILL GET THINGS DONE AND WE KNOW THEY WANT TO HELP I MEAN OUR ALLIED STORAGE BROUGHT IN CAN CONNEX BOXES. AND THEY WANTED TO HELP. EVERYBODY WANTS TO HELP IN THE ONE I KNOW HOW CAN WE HELP AND THAT'S WHERE WE PROBABLY ARE STRONG THIS IS BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A TIGHT A COMMUNITY. DIXIE MAY FIRST IN THEIR HEART OF FORTY FOUR YEARS YOU BACK BEING CALL IN SOME FAVORS AND MAKE IT WORK AND WE WANT TO HELP EVERYBODY WE CAN. SO CRITICAL NEEDS HVAC POWER. I SAID I HAVE SAID FOR YEARS AND I LAY IN BED I THE WEIRDEST THINGS I DO WAKE UP AT THREE AM AGO OH MY GOSH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN. AND THE WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS FIRST WITH WAS IN THE OROVILLE DAM. SO YOU'RE BACK AWAY TO BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND YOU TOOK HIM TO CHICO WITH THAT THIS OVERALL FAIRGROUND SO IN A STORM. CONCEIVABLY POWERS GOING TO GO OUT. THEN WHAT YOU GOT TO MOVE AGAIN. TO GET A DISASTER WITHIN A DISASTER AND WE'RE GONNA MOVING. TO SO WE NEED TO HAVE. POWER SOME SORT OF POWER EITHER EITHER HAVE IT HOOKED UP SO WE CAN TAKE POWER OR JUST. BE PREPARED FOR THE POWER WE HAVE TO HAVE POWER ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF THE P. GINNY'S PROPOSING.

GENERATORS MAYBE HE CAN GET THEM BECAUSE IN IN DISASTERS THEY'RE NOT SO READILY AVAILABLE. SO NOW YOU GOT TO MOVE THESE PEOPLE NOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE EVEN FARTHER AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES.

OUR FAIRGROUNDS OUR OLD -- WHEN THEY WERE BRINGING IN ALL THE SHOWER FACILITIES WE HAVE LOTS A SHOWER FACILITIES BROUGHT ON IN AND -- BATHROOMS AND WE HAD TO GET BLATTER'S BECAUSE WE WERE SET WE WERE NOT SURE. HOW WELL OUR SEWER IS GOING TO HOLD NOW WE'RE READY FOR THE FAIR WE GET SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WE HAVE A CONCESSION TRAILERS AND WE KNOW WE CAN HOPE FOR THAT BUT THEY DON'T RUN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SO IT.

RESTROOMS AND SHOWER FACILITIES NOW ALL WE HAVE ON OUR FAIRGROUNDS ONE SHOWER WHEN SHE OUR FACILITY -- SO AND IT'S GOOD FOR WHAT WE DO BUT WHEN YOU BRING IN PEOPLE AND THEY'RE GONNA NEED SHOWER FACILITIES YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BRING IN SHOWER FACILITIES. STAFFING AGAIN WILL WE HAVE TO HAVE HELP WITH THE STAFFING AND AND MAYBE SOME REALLY SOME FROM SOME OF THE BUREAUCRACY THAT DOES OUR STAFFING YOU KNOW -- WE TALK ABOUT THE TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES IN AND AND RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR TIME WELL WHEN WE BURN UP ALL OUR TIME. IN AN EVACUATION THAT WE HAVE NO TIME TO USE THEM. FOR OUR AT OUR EVENTS THAT WE NEED. FOR I INTERNET COMMUNICATION ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE IT. WE WERE MEDICAL FACILITY. THEY NEEDED DEDICATED INTERNET HAPA. THE COULD NOT GET THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS WITHOUT IT. SO THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO SAY HAS A BAD TO CARRY ON THEIR BOXES AND SECURE THEM OF MEDICAL RECORDS -- EQUIPMENT AGAIN WE HAD NEED EQUIPMENT -- WE THERE USED TO BE IN EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT FIND AT AFTER ANY AND THAT WOULD ALLOW WE BE ABLE TO PUT IN FOR IT AND GET EQUIPMENT I HAD TO BE COUNTY FAIR I WAS ABLE TO GET A TRACTOR ONE TIME -- FUNDING FORKLIFTS I KNOW OUR FORKLIFT FINALLY DIED AFTER THIS -- EPISODE OF OF DOING THIS AND BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE EQUIPMENT TO TO HELP BETTER SERVE TO BETTER SERVE WE'RE NOT.

STRIKES WE HAVE TO HAVE THE DIALOGUE BEFORE THE DISASTER STRIKES I MEAN I YOU KNOW -- AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW OUR FACILITY LIKE WE DO YOU KNOW PEOPLE COME ON THE FACILITY AND THEY WANT TO DO ALL THE THINGS AND YOU KNOW I HAD TRUCKS BEING PUT IN THE WRONG PLACE THEM ALL YOU. THE SECOND HOLD YOU'RE PLUGGING INTO THE POWER OF THE BUILDING THAT. HAS A GENERATOR AND WE NEED THAT POWER TO HOLD SO DIALOGUE BEFORE MAPPING OUT THE FAIRGROUNDS SO WE KNOW I'VE BEEN TALKING OUR FARMERS ABOUT GIVING. ME THE DIMENSIONS OF WILL HELP WALK PATHS IN THE PAST THE TROUBLE NO THESE SO I CAN DEVELOP PLANS AGAIN JUST HANDED SOMEONE AND SAY HERE YOU GO -- EXPERTISE AND HELP WHEN WHEN WE NEED IT THAT YOU KNOW -- LIKE FIRE MARSHAL LISTINGS EXPERTISE AND HELP CONTROLS WE HAVE TO HAVE THE CONTROLS. YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYBODY COME ON THE FAIRGROUNDS WITHOUT SOMEBODY CONTROLLING IT EITHER AND IF THAT'S OUR JOB AND WE NEED TO BE. AWARE THAT THAT'S OUR JOB BUT THERE HAS TO BE CONTROLS PEOPLE NEED TO BE CHECKING IN PEOPLE AND AND HAVING LISTEN THOSE THINGS BECAUSE WE NEED CONTROLS WE NEED TO KNOW WHO'S ON THE GROUNDS AND AND WHY. DONATIONS MANAGEMENT. A YES NO PERSON HE'S GOING TO SAY YES TO THIS OR NOTED THAT THE PUBLIC AND INTERNET THOSE THINGS. UP ON NON CASH OF THINGS. FIRE CODE WE NEED HELP WITH THE FIRE CODE BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE SPENDING YOUR NIGHTS I HAD THE FIRE MARSHAL COME ON THE GROUNDS WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN THEY GO TO SET UP. THE SET UP IN THERE CAUSING ACTUALLY A POTENTIAL. I DISASTER YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU CAN EAT YOU THEY'RE WALKING DOORS OF THOSE THINGS SO FAR MARSHALL COMES ON ONLY ONE MAKE SURE WE ARE SAFE. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO DISASTER WITHIN A DISASTER SO WE NEED TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT WE NEED -- YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT CAME UP FOR US WAS AUDIBLE FIRE ALARM. STILL DEPARTMENT DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BECAUSE THEY'RE SPENDING THE NIGHT IN THE BUILDING WHICH IS CODE YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN AUDIBLE FIRE ALARM THEY HAD TO TELL THEM HOW THEY WERE GOING TO WAKE PEOPLE UP IN CASE. THE FIRE HAPPENED -- YOU KNOW THOSE TYPE OF THINGS BUT WHAT WE WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS THE THOSE TYPE OF THINGS WE JUST NEED. TO BE ABLE TO SERVE BETTER. WE JUST NEED SOME HELP I WE WANT TO SERVE AND WE'RE PROUD TO SERVE I MEAN NOBODY'S PROUDER THAN THE FEAR INDUSTRY DOES TO SERVE IN THIS CAPACITY. IS PROBABLY PROUD OF IN OUR ANNUAL FAIR. A PROUD TO DO THIS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TO FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE IS ABOVE AND BEYOND YES WE'RE VERY PROUD OF IT OUR OUR OUR STAFF WALKED AROUND. AFTER THIS JUST SO PROUD. AND AND THE INDUSTRY'S PROUD SO IN ORDER FOR US TO SERVE. OUR CALIFORNIANS BETTER. WE JUST NEED TO WORK ON THESE THINGS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I'M I'M NOT CLIFF MY JERSEY YOU'RE NOT CLIP. FROM SISKIYOU COWBOY HAT YEAH I DO THE ONLY SIMILARITY -- MY NAME'S DAVE BILL OF THE ON THE AFTER MANAGER OF THE YUBA SUTTER FAIR HERE YOU TO CITY. SO AS YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW -- WE WERE THE SITE -- THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CASCADE FIRE IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CAMPFIRE EVACUATION CENTER -- FOR BOTH INCIDENTS -- REAL REAL QUICKLY TO SUMMARIZE IT WE HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN OUR BUILDINGS OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY RV SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FORTY TWO ACRES OF THE FAIRGROUNDS -- THAT DONATION CENTER THAT RECEIVED OVER I'M TEN SEMI LOADS OF OF GOODS. AND DURING THE ONSET OF IT WE WERE FIRST OPENED UP WITH OUR LOCAL -- YES THEN IT TRANSFERRED INTO STATE -- YES AND THEN I TRANSFERRED OVER TO RED CROSS -- SO WITH THOSE TRENDS THAT THE WITH THOSE TRANSITIONS A LOT OF DIFFERENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES I WHICH WHICH EACH -- FOR GOING THROUGH AND CHANGE MADE TRADE A LOT OF CHALLENGES -- WHEN THE CHANGES TOOK PLACE -- CURRENTLY NOW WE ARE STILL -- ACTING AS A FEMALE SITE -- FOR FORTY PLUS -- RV TRAILERS -- SINCE THE CAMPFIRE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT -- AT LEAST GREATEST THIS COMING DECEMBER. SO WE'VE DEALT WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT -- AGENCIES -- AND I AND AS I SAY HERE LISTEN TO ALL THE TESTIMONY OF ALL THE COLLEAGUES I TO COME BEFORE ME -- I THINK ONE THING STANDS OUT. AND THAT THE CONSISTENCY OF THE CHALLENGES -- WE'VE ALL MENTION INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS -- STE WE'VE ALL MENTION STAFFING. THOSE TWO ARE ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT REALLY SPEAK IT THAT REALLY COME TO MIND -- WHEN FIRST WHEN YOU OPEN UP THE -- EVACUATION CENTER -- AND AND ALSO WOULD OCCUR WHEN YOU GO TO CLOSE IT -- BUT I THINK THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES IN TERMS OF JUST HOW IMPORTANT -- AND HOW CONSISTENT THESE CHALLENGES ARE IN THE NEEDS TO REALLY FACETIME ON HEAD ON AM. I THE NUMBER SO TO CUT PERINEAL LOOKING FORWARD. HOW DO WE GET HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD HOW ARE WE MORE HOW DO WE BECOME I'M MORE PREPARED FOR THE NEXT ONE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN -- I HAVE ONE WORD PREPAREDNESS AND THIS PREPAREDNESS IN TERMS OF IMPROVING OUR FACILITIES. AND YOU KNOW WE'VE ALL MENTION AGE BACK SYSTEMS WE HAVE FOR HEATERS IN OUR MAIN EXHIBIT DONATE SIXTEEN THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT BUILDING THAT HOUSE OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE. TWO OF THE FOUR WORK. THE ON THE OTHER TWO ARE IN REPAIRABLE. THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE PLACED IN CORNERS OF THE BUILDING WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF CENTRAL -- I HAVE -- DEPOSITS OF THE AIR. AND THOSE CORNERS GET HOT DRESS IT ONLY GETS COLD. AND THOSE BUILDING DOES HEATERS ARE PROBABLY OVER SIXTY SEVEN YEARS OLD WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FINANCIALLY TO BE ABLE TO UPDATE AS BUT HERE THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN IN EVACUATION CENTER -- FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND WHEN I TALK ABOUT LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND PAT JUST GOT DONE TALKING ABOUT IT THIS WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN THIS THIS IS WE WE'RE HERE FOR COMMUNITIES. I'M IN THE RECENT EXPERIENCE WE'RE HERE FOR OUR OUTSIDE FOR OUR FOR THE NEXT COMMUNITY AND YOU COUNTY THAT THE CAMPFIRE DIDN'T TAKE PLACE AND SUTTER COUNTY OR YOU THE COUNTY WHICH WE REPRESENT. BUT AGAIN WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR OUR HANDS ARE OPEN -- JUST LIKE ANY FAIR GROUNDS WOULD IN THE TIRES IN THE TIRE NETWORK A CALIFORNIA FIRES. AND SO I THINK THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES AGAIN ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHERE WHERE ARE ON OUR OUR HEART IS AND WE WANT TO BE THERE FOR THE COMMUNITIES. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PREPAREDNESS PLANNING I THINK IT WE REALLY AGAIN WE NEED TO HAVE A A PREPARED PLAN FOR EACH BACKGROUNDS. I KNOW WE DON'T I KNOW WE DENNETT HOW WEAK STARTED ON ONE YES NOW OF COURSE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS -- BUT AGAIN I THINK THAT'S WE CERTAINLY COULD USE SOME HELP FROM THE STATE. IN TERMS OF EITHER FUNDING FOR SOMEBODY TO COME IN AND HELP WITH THOSE -- THOSE THINGS THAT PLANTS -- OR JUST SOME -- EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF HOW TO DEVELOP THOSE. AND THE CLEARLY HURT IN CONCERT WITH YOU ALL YES YOU ARE THE EXPERTS OF YOUR OWN FACILITIES YEAH YES DEFINITELY BUT IN TERMS OF THE OF I JUST OVERALL BASIS OF THE PLAN ITSELF -- IT HAS BEEN SPOKEN TO ABOUT BEFORE BUT AGAIN PREPAREDNESS IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATING IN COORDINATING AMONGST DIFFERENT AGENCIES. CALLOW YES LOCAL -- YES RED CROSS -- WHEN WE WHEN WE TRANSITION FROM EACH OF THOSE DIFFERENT AGENCIES -- I'M ON THE PHONE WITH CDFA I'M ON THE PHONE WITH CARILLO YES I'M ON THE PHONE WITH RED CROSS AND GETTING MIXED MIXED COMMUNICATION AND MIXED MESSAGES IN TERMS OF WHO'S OPERATING THIS WHO'S IN CHARGE OF WHAT -- AND AND WHEN RED CROSS SHOWED UP WE DO MEAN WE WEREN'T WE WERE THE LAST TWO TO HEAR ABOUT IT OF COURSE. SO I THINK SOMEBODY AT THE STATE LEVEL WHETHER THAT'S THAT CDFA OR YES THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A POINT OF CONTACT TO HELP IN TERMS OF A LOT OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES WOULD BE -- A GREAT HELP -- AND AGAIN ALL OF THE EXITING WE HAD A WHEN WHEN RED CROSS OR CALLOW YES WHOEVER WANTS TO WHEN WHEN THEY DECIDE TO LEAVE. I'M WE NEED TO BE INFORMED OF THAT -- WE WERE THE LAST TO BE INFORMED OF IT AND OF COURSE -- HERE WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW OVER A HUNDRED RV THAT WERE LEFT AT THE SITE -- WANTING TO YOU KNOW NOT WANTING TO GO TO A NEW SITE -- BUT YET WORD WHEN WE'RE GOOD WE'VE BEEN THE BACK DE ACTIVATED SO NOW WE'RE TRYING. TO KILEY REMOVE -- EVACUEES -- IN A IN A MANNER THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEWS. I'M SO THAT CREATES A LOT OF ISSUES. AND I GUESS I THINK THAT STARTS WITH A LOT OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND HAVING THAT POINT PERSON AT THE STATE LEVEL -- HELP WHETHER THAT'S AGAIN THE CDFA OR YES -- THAT WOULD BE AT A MAJOR HELP -- BUT AGAIN I I THINK -- AGAIN -- AS WELL IN PREPAREDNESS IS HAVING THE MO YOU -- DONE WITH EITHER YOUR LOCAL -- YASSER YOUR STATE OR THE STATE -- YES OFFICE PRIOR TO BE HAPPENING -- AFGHAN DENTAL OF COURSE WITH THE EFFORT FACED WITH RED CROSS BUT BEING ABLE TO BE PREPARED FOR THESE ACTUALLY HAVING HIM -- YOU IN PLACE I WILL CERTAINLY HELP IN TERMS OF ONE HAVING A POINT OF CONTACT WITH THAT AGENCY AT THAT TIME YOU'VE ALREADY SPOKEN WITH THEM YOU'VE MET YOU'VE MADAM. HERE SOMEWHAT AND AND YOU'RE READY FOR THIS I KNOW IN OUR EXPERIENCE I'D GROUP YOU KNOW ON ON WITHIN THE FIRST COUPLE WEEKS OF TAKING THE JOB I WENT MET WITH MY LOCAL -- YES THAT ORTIZ AND IT WAS EASY TRANSITION THE VERY BEGINNING WHEN THEY TOOK OVER IT WAS AFTER THEY LEFT. AND WE'RE WITH CALORIE ASPER RED CROSS IS WHEN ISSUE STARTED TO ARISE IN TERMS OF THE COMMUNICATION AND AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. SO AGAIN -- I'M I'M NOT GONNA BE REDUNDANT WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE HEARD I THINK EVERYBODY SPOT ON IN TERMS OF THE CHALLENGES -- I THINK EFFORT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS ARE GOING TO GO A LONG WAYS IN TERMS OF NOT DOING PATCHWORK BUT DOING IMPROVEMENTS SO WHEN EMERGED VIRTUALLY DOES TAKE PLACE. I WE CAN OPEN UP THE GATES IN BE READY WITHOUT HAVING TO BRING AND THIS PATCHWORK THAT PATCHWORK THAT FIXED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE -- THE PUBLIC -- THE INTEGRATED MANNER THAT WE AS A FAIR INDUSTRY -- PRIDE OURSELVES ON SO THANK YOU OKAY [inaudible] WELL. PRESIDENTE FANTASTIC JOB ALL OF YOU AND I THINK -- MY HUGE TAKE WORDS AND PICTURES BEEN TAKING NOTES -- WE STILL HAVE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE DEPARTMENT HERE -- AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR THAT WHAT WILL WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW MONEY IS NEEDED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO I THINK MORE QUICKLY -- IS AT LEAST PUT TOGETHER TALK ABOUT GETTING SOME POINT PEOPLE SOME STRIKE TEAMS AND LIKE WORKING GROUPS TOGETHER HOW DO WE BETTER COORDINATE. RIGHTS NOT IF THE NEXT ONE'S GONNA KERR IT'S WHEN AND WHERE -- AND AS YOU'VE ALL SAID DIDN'T YOU MOBILIZE. IT TRULY FEELS LIKE YOU KNOW I'M SORRY IT'S TAKEN THIS LONG TO DO. A HEARING ON THIS ISSUE -- THAT YOU TRULY ARE THE UNSUNG HEROES OF SO MANY DISASTERS THAT ARE OCCURRING AROUND OUR STATE. AND WE KNOW WHERE I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THIS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT THE AMOUNT OF THE YOU KNOW THE FOR THE FLOODS AND AND EVERYTHING WE'RE HAVING. SO WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME WE APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO ON THE GROUND AT THE MASS COORDINATION THAT JUGGLING -- THE YOU KNOW THE WORK THAT GOES WITHOUT THANKS A LOT AND WE KNOW WHO YOU DO IT BECAUSE YOU CARE AND YOU INVESTED IN YOUR COMMUNITIES AND YOU'RE INVESTED IN PEOPLE. AND ANIMALS -- AND EVERYTHING THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT -- SO WE THANK YOU FOR TAKING YOUR TIME TO COME UP -- YOU'LL HEAR BACK FROM US AGAIN YOU KNOW YOU MAY NOT BE TOMORROW THE NEXT DAY -- BUT I HAVE CERTAINLY HEARD -- CERTAIN HURLEY FOR YOUR CONCERNS AND AS WE ARE GETTING READY TO MOVE IN A FIRE SEASON AGAIN IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US -- TO GET TOGETHER MORE QUICKLY AND DON'T YOU KNOW DON'T LEAVE YOU ALL HOLDING THE BAG OUT THERE IN THE FIELD. BUT TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE PROACTIVE ON THE STATE SIDE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ALL ANA CDFA -- YES WE'LL BE TALKING MORE LATER. THANK YOU. TO CONCLUDE THE HEARING
