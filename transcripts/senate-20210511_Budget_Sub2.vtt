00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:45.998
INEFFICIENCIES. DR BOHAN. YEAH

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.700
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION- CHAIR

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.635
WE HAVE DONE A LOT ABOUT REACH

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:51.237
ON THIS TOPIC WHICH- HOSTED A

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:52.839
COUPLE WORKSHOPS TO GET INPUT

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:54.841
FROM OF COURSE THE SCHOOLS THAT

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.609
WOULD BE IMPACTED- COULD BE

00:07:56.676 --> 00:07:59.445
RECEIVING FUNDS BUT ALSO FROM-

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:00.713
FROM LABOR FROM ENVIRONMENTAL

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.882
COMMUNITY FROM A VARIETY OF.

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:05.184
SOURCES AND SO YES WE THINK

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:07.887
THAT THE VENTILATION- WILL WILL

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:09.755
IMPROVE CERTAINLY CERTAINLY

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.691
VENTILATION AND INVITED COVE

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:13.059
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT IN ITS OWN

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:15.494
RIGHT BUT ALSO IN MANY CASES.

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:17.129
WILL IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:18.531
THE UNITS THAT PROVIDE

00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:19.832
VENTILATION. A LOT OF THESE

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.601
UNITS ARE OLD AND THE FIRST

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:24.470
TRANCHE OF FUNDING IS FOCUSED

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:26.639
ON- TAKING A LOOK AT THE AT THE

UNITS THAT ARE INSTALLED IN

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:28.774
SCHOOLS PREFER WORKING

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:30.376
PROPERLY. BRING THEM UP TO

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:32.178
SPEED IF NEED BE AND THEN WILL

BE LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL

00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:34.080
CRUSHES THE FUNDING GOING

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:35.915
FORWARD AND THEN THE PLUMBING-

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:38.150
WATER IS THE CONSUMPTION THE

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:39.986
DELIVERY CONSUMPTION AND

BACKEND. IS AMONG THE LARGEST

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:45.858
SOURCE OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN

00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:47.126
CALIFORNIA SO TO THE EXTENT WE

G. R. US- THAT TOTAL AMOUNT IS

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:40.165
BASED LARGELY ON- SOME OF OUR

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:40.733
REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT WE

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.735

WHICH ARE ABOUT A BILLION

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:47.339
DOLLARS HIGHER THAN THE

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:48.907
GOVERNOR CHANDERI BUDGET OVER

CURRENT YEAR AND THE BUDGET

00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:52.778
YEAR. THAT'S BASED ON RESULTS

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:54.279
FROM SOME OF THE MOST RECENT

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:56.215
AUCTION IN FEBRUARY AS WELL AS

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:57.182
SOME OF THE RECENT MARKET

00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:59.918
TRENDS- AND IS ASSUMES

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:00.819
ESSENTIALLY I'LL BE ALLOWED TO

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:02.588
SELL AT THE MINIMUM PRICE WHICH

00:17:02.654 --> 00:17:05.324
IS KIND OF CONSISTENT WITH-

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:07.393
COMMENTS ORACLE TRENDS. NOW AS

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:08.727
YOU KNOW A LARGE CHUNK OF THAT

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:10.162
ADDITIONAL REVENUE UNDER

00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:11.397
CURRENT LAW GOES TO GENERAL'S

00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:12.798
APPROPRIATIONS AND SO THAT

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:13.932
LEAVES A SMALLER CHUNK FOR

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:14.933
DISCRETIONARY SPENDING BUT

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.775
THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING.

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:23.242
AVAILABLE BASED ON OUR

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:24.176
ESTIMATES. I SO BASED ON THAT

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:26.145
WE DO THINK THAT- ABOUT OE

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:28.113
FOUR BILLION. TO BE ALEX- BASED

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:28.881
ON ADDRESS ASKING WHILE ALL

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:30.249
MAKING. A VERY REASONABLE AND

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:31.884
HEALTHY RESEARCH WHICH I THINK

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:32.818
IS IMPORTANT GIVEN THE REVENUE

ANNUALLY AND SO I THINK THAT'S

00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:54.960
IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.128
THINKING ABOUT. LONG TERM

00:19:56.194 --> 00:19:57.062

BROWN COULD YOU. ON THE IMPACT

THIS SPENDING PROGRAM WILL HAVE

ON CARBON REDUCTION I KNOW A

00:20:10.108 --> 00:20:11.777
LOT OF TIMES WE GET INTO AIR

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:15.247

CARBON IMPACT THAT THAT TYPE

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:31.763
OF- EXPENDITURE PLANNER. BUT

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.832
POTENTIAL EXPENDITURE PLAN.

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:34.933
YEAH I DON'T I MEAN I DON'T

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.903
THINK- WE HAVE ANY KIND OF-

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.871
SPECIFIC OUTCOME QUANTITATIVE

00:20:39.938 --> 00:20:41.239
SORT OF OUTCOME MEASURES BASED

00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:42.374
ON THE PLAN THAT HAS BEEN

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:46.311
PROVIDED TO US BUT- CLEARLY-

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:47.679
SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:49.915
AND METHANE IS A- SIGNIFICANT

00:20:49.982 --> 00:20:51.383
SOURCE OF THE STATE'S OVERALL

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.753
EMISSIONS AND- LOOKING AT THE-

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.854
TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:56.655
THAT THEIR RESOURCES BOARD PUT

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:58.190
TOGETHER. METHANE EMISSION

00:20:58.256 --> 00:20:59.725
REDUCTIONS BOTH ON THE VERY

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:02.461
SIDE AS WELL AS THE WASTE SIDE-

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:03.895
ARE A LARGE CHUNK ABOUT A THIRD

00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:05.163
OF KIND OF THE EXPECTED

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.531
EMISSION REDUCTIONS KIND OF

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:07.899
NEEDED TO MEET THE STATE'S

00:21:07.966 --> 00:21:08.767
TWENTY THIRTY GOALS SO THAT'S A

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:10.502
BIG. BIG CHUNK OF THE EMISSION

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:13.605
REDUCTIONS ARE EXPECTED AND SO-

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:14.973
YEAH I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THAT

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.508
THAT PART OF THE PLAN SORT OF

00:21:16.575 --> 00:21:17.509
TARGET STATEN OTHER QUESTIONS

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:19.411
ABOUT HOW MUCH STATE BUDGET

00:21:19.478 --> 00:21:21.279
SUPPORT IS NEEDED VERSUS JUST

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:22.314
SORT OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:23.849
BUT- I'M CLEARLY IT'S SORT OF

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:25.484
TARGETS ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.552
OF- OF EMISSIONS IN THE STATE

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:28.720
AND- ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:30.088
STATE HAS FOR ACHIEVING ITS-

00:21:30.155 --> 00:21:32.057
ITS CHARTERS. AS BEEN AND- YOU

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.358
KNOW WE HAVE A COUPLE EXECUTIVE

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:34.793
ORDERS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.696
PREVIOUSLY ONE FOR. A COMES UP

00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:39.364
IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE FOR A

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:40.799
MILLION CLEAN CARS ON THE ROAD

00:21:40.866 --> 00:21:44.302
IS HAVE CARS AND THEN TWENTY

00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:44.870
TWENTY FIVE ONE POINT FIVE

00:21:44.936 --> 00:21:45.837
MILLION A COUPLE OF GOVERNORS.

00:21:45.904 --> 00:21:53.211
HAVE HAVE- THOSE ARE AS GOALS.

00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:54.513
THIS TYPE OF FUNDING PLAN. WITH

00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:55.847
THE CALM. OF THE MEDIUM SIZE

00:21:55.914 --> 00:21:59.317
TRUCKS THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES.

00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:01.787
I PRESUME IT GETS US CLOSER TO

00:22:01.853 --> 00:22:04.322
THAT GOAL DO YOU WANT TO. GIVE

00:22:04.389 --> 00:22:05.924
US YOUR CRYSTAL BALL OF THE IS

00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:07.426
THIS THE TYPE OF INVESTMENT

00:22:07.492 --> 00:22:08.794
THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO HELP

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.562
WITH THE MARKET PLACE AND

00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:12.164
CONSUMERS. ARE HELP US ACHIEVE

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.500
THOSE GOALS. YEAH I MEAN I

00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:16.802
THINK THERE'S A THERE'S WE HAD

00:22:16.868 --> 00:22:18.136
KIND OF A- FAIRLY LENGTHY

00:22:18.203 --> 00:22:20.405
DISCUSSION IN A- JOINT HEARING

00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:23.241
A FEW WEEKS AGO- YEAH THESE ARE

00:22:23.308 --> 00:22:24.276
THE GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT

00:22:24.342 --> 00:22:27.546
OUT ARE ARE. QUITE AMBITIOUS

00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:29.247
AND SO- WILL NEED TO BE KIND OF

00:22:29.314 --> 00:22:30.582
A LOT OF STATE POLICIES.

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:32.684
IMPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE

00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:34.953
THOSE AMBITIOUS GOALS- I THINK

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.822
MORE FUNDING KIND OF IN A LOT

00:22:36.888 --> 00:22:38.190
OF THOSE AREAS CAN BE ONE PIECE

00:22:38.256 --> 00:22:40.292
OF THAT. PUZZLE I THINK. THE

00:22:40.358 --> 00:22:42.194
CHALLENGE COMES IN AND KIND OF

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.595
YOU KNOW HOW HOW THOSE POLICIES

00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:44.763
IN THAT BUDGETS ARE GONNA RACKS

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.865
WITH. REGULATORY PROGRAMS AND

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:48.133
ALL THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES FIT

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.602
TOGETHER SO THAT MAKES THAT'S

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:51.169
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES

00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:52.304
IT. DIFFICULT TO KIND OF. PUT A

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:53.905
QUANTITATIVE NUMBER ON KIND OF

00:22:53.972 --> 00:22:55.807
EXACTLY THE SORT OF. HOW FAR

00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:57.809
THIS FUNDING MOTORISTS AND WHAT

00:22:57.876 --> 00:22:58.744
OTHER KIND OF POLICIES AND

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.846
ACTIONS ARE NEEDED BUT- I THINK

00:23:00.912 --> 00:23:01.546
IT'S FAIR TO SAY SORT OF

00:23:01.613 --> 00:23:03.782
ADDITIONAL FUNDING SUPPORT IN A

00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:06.418
LOT OF THESE AREAS- CAN KIND OF

00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:07.219
HELP US GET. AT LEAST PART OF

00:23:07.285 --> 00:23:09.421
HE WAY THERE. OKAY TODAY I

00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:10.021
GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:23:10.088 --> 00:23:11.189
THAT WE'RE CONCERNED WITH NOT

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:12.491
GOING TO GET ON TO SECTORS

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:30.662
FINE YOU GOT MONEY- IN THE IN.

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:35.667
THE LOCAL THE LOCAL AIR

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:36.734
DISTRICTS I AM NOT. THIS YEAR'S

00:30:36.801 --> 00:30:39.170
THE- SAYS FOR ONE YEAR PAID OUT

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:41.439
OF THESE OTHER FUNDS. OBVIOUSLY

00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:42.874
NEXT YEAR WE HAVE TO COME BACK

00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:43.741
BUT IF THE GOAL IS AIR

00:30:43.808 --> 00:30:45.910
POLLUTION. AND WE'RE ALL WE'RE

00:30:45.977 --> 00:30:47.278
ALL SECRETARIES AND TECHNICAL

00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:49.013
PEOPLE ADMINISTRATION FOLKS WE

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.315
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:52.350
CARBON REDUCTION. AND POLLUTION

00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:54.686
IN PUBLIC HEALTH WHY IS THE

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:55.954
PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.655
NOT SHIPPING IN SOME MONEY TO

00:30:57.722 --> 00:30:59.290
HELP OUT WITH THIS OUTREACH

00:30:59.357 --> 00:31:03.995
PROGRAM PROGRAM'S FIFTEEN GAUGE.

00:31:04.062 --> 00:31:07.031
PEOPLE I MEAN IT'S A IT'S A

00:31:07.098 --> 00:31:09.367
QUESTION OF THE BALANCE OF WHAT

00:31:09.434 --> 00:31:10.602
PORTION OF IT IS CARBON

00:31:10.668 --> 00:31:11.736
REDUCTION I'M NOT SAYING

00:31:11.803 --> 00:31:13.238
THERE'S NO CARBON REDUCTION BUT

00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:16.074
A LOT OF IT IS. IS YOU KNOW

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:16.975
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE

00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:19.310
BUDGET IS TO FOR HIRE LOCAL AIR

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:22.547
DISTRICT. PERSONNEL IN BLIGHTED

00:31:22.614 --> 00:31:25.516
IT WHEN. WHEN YOU COME THAT

00:31:25.583 --> 00:31:29.087
CLOSE TO THE CHARGE OF. THE THE

00:31:29.153 --> 00:31:33.691
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. WELL AT

00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:36.261
TUESDAY'S VISIBLE AND THE OTHER

00:31:36.327 --> 00:31:39.230
RELATED TO AIR POLLUTION- AND

00:31:39.297 --> 00:31:40.398
YOU CAN DENY THIS BUT I THINK

00:31:40.465 --> 00:31:42.066
JUST FOR THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:45.670
REITERATING- THE MAJOR CLEAN

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:47.171
AIR ACT LANDMARK DECISION OF

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:48.873
THE SUPREME COURT WAS TO DECIDE

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.508
THAT CABIN WAS INTACT AND

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:54.078
POLLUTION THAT REQUIRED- ASKED

00:31:54.145 --> 00:31:55.146
TO REGULATED UNDER THE CLEAN

00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:57.982
AIR ACT- SO I DEFINITELY SEE

00:31:58.049 --> 00:32:01.519
CABIN AS ABSOLUTION- AND AS A

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:04.222
AS A POLLUTANT I'M IN TERMS OF

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:09.294
THE LOCAL AD DISTRICTS ROLE-

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.463
AND IS. REGULATE STATIONERY'S

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.532
OF POLLUTION. MANY OF WHICH

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:16.901
CONTRIBUTE BOTH- CRITERIA

00:32:16.968 --> 00:32:19.704
POLLUTANTS AND CARBON POLLUTION

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:22.240
AND IN THAT LOCAL AREA- WHAT WE

00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:25.143
FOUND. IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:26.311
CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE

00:32:26.377 --> 00:32:28.413
INSPECTION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:31.582
JUSTICE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:33.484
ARE SUFFERING TODAY FROM

00:32:33.551 --> 00:32:36.054
ABSOLUTION- IN THE FORM OF

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.656
ASTHMA IN THE FORM OF INCREASED

00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:41.526
MORTALITY. FROM PM TWO POINT

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:43.561
FIVE- AND A LOT OF THE SAME

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:45.663
SOURCES ALSO AS SOURCES OF

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.299
CARBON POLLUTION SO OFTEN. AS

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:49.634
YOU KNOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:52.837
DIFFICULT TO DETACH- AND

00:32:52.904 --> 00:32:54.872
UNNECESSARY IN MANY CASES TO

00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:57.842
SAY THIS DIESEL TRUCK- IS.

00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:59.577
ALLUDING JUST DIESEL THE TICKET

00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:01.579
WHAT MATTER ALSO. A LEADING

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:02.847
COMPING COLLISION INTO THE

00:33:02.914 --> 00:33:04.515
ATMOSPHERE SO WE THINK THIS IS

00:33:04.582 --> 00:33:06.951
ACTUALLY A VERY INNOVATIVE WAY

00:33:07.018 --> 00:33:09.320
OUT AN IMPORTANT WAY TO USE

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:11.889
TEACHER AT FUNDING. THE ROLE

00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:13.758
THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD

00:33:13.825 --> 00:33:16.794
BOARD PLACES CRITICAL. IN THAT

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:18.529
IT IS A VERY DECENTRALIZED

00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:22.400
CHAD- DECENTRALIZED. WAY IN

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:24.202
WHICH GOVERNMENTS HAPPENS IN

00:33:24.268 --> 00:33:26.504
CALIFORNIA- NO NO WHERE ELSE IN

00:33:26.571 --> 00:33:28.039
THE COUNTRY HAS THIRTY FOUR AT

00:33:28.106 --> 00:33:30.608
DISTRICTS- AND AN AIR RESOURCES

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:34.011
BOARD AND A COUNTY PA WE HAVE A

00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:35.847
LOT A LOT OF GOVERNANCE AND A

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:37.515
LOT OF GROUND THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:33:37.582 --> 00:33:39.350
COVERED. AND SO IT'S REALLY

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:41.219
IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THE

00:33:41.285 --> 00:33:43.755
DECISION MAKING RIGHT. IF WE

00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:45.523
COME OUT WITH CLIMATE SOLUTIONS

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.692
THAT ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE OR NOT

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:49.694
INVOLVING LOCALS. FROM THE

00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:51.529
EARLIEST STAGES IN THE DESIGN

00:33:51.596 --> 00:33:53.398
AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE

00:33:53.464 --> 00:33:57.668
RULES- WE RUN THE RISK OF US

00:33:57.735 --> 00:33:59.971
NOT INVOLVING THE VERY PEOPLE

00:34:00.037 --> 00:34:02.340
WHO ARE. THE MOST VULNERABLE TO

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:04.876
CRIME AND OTHER IMPACTS SO YEAH

00:34:04.942 --> 00:34:12.216
I THINK IS A VERY VALID- USE OF

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:13.985
G. FUNDING- ASPECT GIVEN. THE

00:34:14.051 --> 00:34:15.253
GENESIS OF THE MOST RECENT

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:16.954
ITERATION OF HOW SHE- FUNDING

00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:18.823
CAME IN BEING- AND AS IT

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.124
RELATES TO THE COP STAFF I

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:21.526
THINK. THEY THEY PLAY A

00:34:21.592 --> 00:34:23.561
CRITICAL ROLE IN HELPING US TO

00:34:23.628 --> 00:34:25.530
SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE

00:34:25.596 --> 00:34:28.366
LOCAL LEVEL. YEAH I JUST I JUST

00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:30.134
WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT OTHER

00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:32.236
AGENCIES WHO CONTRIBUTE TO WHO

00:34:32.303 --> 00:34:35.106
ARE INTERESTED IN THIS IN THIS-

00:34:35.173 --> 00:34:37.442
A DESIRED OUTCOMES SHE NEEDING

00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:38.609
KICK IN A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY

00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:40.077
FROM THEIR BUDGETS IN ORDER TO

00:34:40.144 --> 00:34:41.779
GET ENTERING. I MEAN WHETHER

00:34:41.846 --> 00:34:43.481
YOU HAVE KICKED THE COMMUNITY

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:45.783
ENGAGED OR NOT IF YOU PUT TWO

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.084
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO

00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:49.487
MAKING YOUR GREEN WASTE WORK

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:50.488
RIGHTS YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE

00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:51.656
EMISSIONS WHETHERPEOPLE

00:34:51.722 --> 00:34:53.357
UNDERSTAND IT OR YOU CAN

00:34:53.424 --> 00:34:55.359
EXPLAIN IT OR HAVE. A PARTY

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:57.361
ABOUT IT IF THAT IF THOSE

00:34:57.428 --> 00:34:58.796
INVESTMENTS GOING TO LOW INCOME

00:34:58.863 --> 00:35:00.798
AREAS AND THEY ACTUALLY SEE THE

00:35:00.865 --> 00:35:02.233
MEASURABLE REDUCTIONS OF

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.269
METHANE OR THE BILLION DOLLARS

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:07.438
FOR AUTOMOBILES AND- TRUCKS

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:09.307
THOSE ARE GOING TO AFFECT THE

00:35:09.373 --> 00:35:10.708
PORTS SEEK YOU CAN'T SPEND THAT

00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:13.611
MUCH MONEY ON HIGH HEAVY TO.

00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:17.181
MEDIUM SIZE VEHICLES OR TRUCKS

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:19.116
AND NOT PRODUCE IT SO IT'S THE

00:35:19.183 --> 00:35:20.551
OUTCOMES I THINK WE'RE ON THE

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:22.587
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH ITS

00:35:22.653 --> 00:35:24.755
THE PATHWAY THAT WE GO. AND

00:35:24.822 --> 00:35:26.858
WHETHER THIS PROGRAM PAYS THE

00:35:26.924 --> 00:35:30.127
ENTIRE NOT OF THE OF EVERYTHING

00:35:30.194 --> 00:35:31.062
THAT'S IMAGINABLE THE PEOPLE

00:35:31.128 --> 00:35:33.865

COMMUNITY GROUPS IS AND HOW

00:36:07.798 --> 00:36:09.600
THAT'S GOING TO REDUCE CARBON

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:12.103
IN THAT AREA I MEAN WE HAVE. WE

00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:15.273

THAT- WE HAVE THE WORST AIR INS

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:23.714
ARE SEVEN OF THE TEN I THINK

00:36:23.781 --> 00:36:25.616
WERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT HOW DOES

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:27.451
THIS ACTUALLY GONNA. WORK ON

00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:29.287
THE GROUND THE DEVIL'S IN THE

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:29.887
DETAILS AND I'M A LITTLE BIT

SATURDAY HOME MEET I'M HAPPY TO

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:42.333
GIVE A SCENARIO SAYS. UNDER THE

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.669
CLEAN AIR ACT- THE NATIONAL

00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:46.270
AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS

00:36:46.337 --> 00:36:48.706
AS SET BY THE UNITED STATES

00:36:48.773 --> 00:36:49.740
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

00:36:49.807 --> 00:36:52.677
AND- UNFORTUNATELY SHE- KLEIN

00:36:52.743 --> 00:36:54.779
SAYS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

00:36:54.845 --> 00:36:56.714
AND THE SOUTH COAST DISTRICT

00:36:56.781 --> 00:36:58.616
WHICH INCLUDES MOST OF

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:01.018
METROPOLITAN ADELAIDE. THE LAST

00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:01.953
FIFTY YEARS WE HAVEN'T BEEN

00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:03.921
ABLE TO ACHIEVE AT QUALITY

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:06.157
STANDARDS- THE STATE IS

00:37:06.223 --> 00:37:08.593
OBLIGATED TO COME OUT WITH. A

00:37:08.659 --> 00:37:12.063
REGIONAL ASH SAID- PLANS CALL

00:37:12.129 --> 00:37:13.531
TO STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS.

00:37:13.598 --> 00:37:15.933
THOSE PLANS LOOK AT THE ENTIRE

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.468
REGION SO TO YOUR CLIENT. LET'S

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:19.103
FOCUS ON THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.171
THERE'S A PLAN THE STATE

00:37:20.237 --> 00:37:22.707
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. THAT THAT-

00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:25.109
BOARD. APPROVES A GIVE AND GOES

00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:27.545
TO. THE STATE AND THEN GOES TO

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:28.746
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT

00:37:28.813 --> 00:37:30.247
STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN ONLY

00:37:30.314 --> 00:37:32.583
LOOKS AT. REGIONAL ACTIVITIES

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.752
AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT.

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:36.487
HEALTH BENEFITS TO LOCAL

00:37:36.554 --> 00:37:38.456
DISADVANTAGED ENVIRONMENTALLY

00:37:38.522 --> 00:37:40.424
JUSTICE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES

00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:41.258
ARE NOT TAKEN INTO

00:37:41.325 --> 00:37:43.628
CONSIDERATION SIGNIFICANTLY IN

00:37:43.694 --> 00:37:45.863
THAT REGIONAL. ASSET PLANNING

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.766
PROCESS AND SO SIX SEVENTEEN-

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:52.970
WHEN IT WAS PASSED- WHAT. LED

00:37:53.037 --> 00:37:54.639
TO THAT AND DISTRICTS. WITH

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:56.641
THEIR RESOURCES BOARD TO WORK

00:37:56.707 --> 00:37:58.809
TOGETHER WITH AND FIND LOCAL

00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:00.845
COMMUNITY PLANNING GROUNDS TO

00:38:00.911 --> 00:38:04.081
SAY HOW CAN WE- REDUCE. AND

00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:05.883
ACHIEVE THESE ATTACK HOLDING

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.285
CLIMATE GOALS WHILE ACTUALLY

00:38:08.352 --> 00:38:10.588
HELPING THE NEEDS OF LOCAL

00:38:10.655 --> 00:38:12.723
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THERE IS A

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.225
SENSE THAT IT WAS JUST REGION

00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:23.034
OVERLY REGION LIES- AND- BACK.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.136
I MET YOU KNOW IS THIS GLOBAL

00:38:25.202 --> 00:38:27.238
ISSUE HOW WE- HOW LOCAL P. SET

00:38:27.304 --> 00:38:29.206
AS IT'S INCLUDING IN THE GO OF

00:38:29.273 --> 00:38:30.708
APTLY IN COBB REDUCTION. THE

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:31.842
NEEDS OF LOW COMMUNITIES AND

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:33.911
THE CAPACITY TO ACT HAVE A SEAT

00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:36.580
AT THE TABLE TO PLAN- THOSE

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:38.049
CHANGES SO I'LL I'LL GIVE AN

00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:43.521
EXAMPLE THE. CHEN SAYS WE ALL

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:46.023
AGREE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE-

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.993
SPENDING FOOD WASTE WHICH EMITS

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.429
METHANE TO THE LEFT AND STILL-

00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:54.832
IT ALSO- CAUSES ALL KINDS OF

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:56.367
OTHER ISSUES BUT- MAKING SURE

00:38:56.434 --> 00:39:00.004
THAT. FOR INSTANCE THE TRUCKS

00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:02.940
OF THE DRIVING THROUGH THE

00:39:03.007 --> 00:39:05.142
COMMUNITY ON THE WAY TO THE

00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:07.511
LEFT AND STILL ARE ALSO CLEANED

00:39:07.578 --> 00:39:09.113
OUT THAT THE COMMUNITIES

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.281
INVOLVED IN MAKING SURE THAT

00:39:10.347 --> 00:39:11.182
THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

00:39:11.248 --> 00:39:12.917
PARKWAY OF THAT TRUCK LOOKS

00:39:12.983 --> 00:39:15.019
LIKE HAS NOT BEEN CONSIDERED-

00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:17.221
THOSE WOULD JUST DRIVING RIGHT

00:39:17.288 --> 00:39:19.423
THROUGH ALL PARKING THOSE-

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.592
FLEET OF RESCUE RESCUES

00:39:21.659 --> 00:39:23.994
VEHICLES IN LOW INCOME THIS IS

00:39:24.061 --> 00:39:27.064
NOT AS COMMUNITIES AS KIND OF

00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:28.466
CONCERNS NEED TO BE INTEGRATED

00:39:28.532 --> 00:39:30.634
AND OTHERWISE WE HAVE HUGE

00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:33.170
BACKLASH TO THESE PROGRAMS WE

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:34.138
THINK THAT WE'RE RESULT

00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:35.773
RESULTING IN THESE REDUCTIONS

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.308
BUT IN FACT. WE THAT HAVE

00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:39.210
COMMUNITY STANDING UP AND SAY

00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:41.212
ACTUALLY WE DON'T LIKE THE WAY

00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:42.713
THAT THE SUIT SCRAPS OF BEING

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.949
BROUGHT TO THIS BY LARGE

00:39:45.015 --> 00:39:46.250
DISTANCES OF THE WE NEED TO

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:47.218
CHANGE THEM AND WHEN YOU DO

00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:48.319
THAT AFTER THE FACT OF

00:39:48.385 --> 00:39:49.653
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DESTRUCTIVE

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.288
AND MORE EXPENSIVE SO BY

00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:53.591
INTEGRATING THE VOICES OF

00:39:53.657 --> 00:39:55.259
COMMUNITIES EARLY ON WE BUT

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:57.394
IT'S GET REDUCTIONS THAT HELP

00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:59.063
WITH HEALTH. HELD REDUCE

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:01.465
IMPACTS- AND MAKE THE PROGRAM

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:03.601
MORE SUCCESSFUL SO HAVE YOU

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:08.939
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION- THE

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:10.074
DISPLACEMENT THAT MEANS I KNOW

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:11.142
THAT. WHEN I WAS ON THE SIERRA

00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:12.376
CONSERVING. THERE IS MANY

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:14.879
STUDIES THAT IF YOU TOOK. EVERY

00:40:14.945 --> 00:40:16.914
PERSON AND EVERY ANYBODY

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:19.250
EVERYTHING OUT OF FRESNO COUNTY

00:40:19.316 --> 00:40:21.051
YOU WOULD STILL HAVE. THE

00:40:21.118 --> 00:40:23.220
PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S QUITE

00:40:23.287 --> 00:40:25.356
FRANKLY SOME OF IT IS. COMING

00:40:25.422 --> 00:40:27.258
FROM OTHER AREAS AND IT SETTLES

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:30.861
IN THAT BASIN AND SO FOR. JUST

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:33.164
KIND OF IT MAY BE A I GUESS A

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:35.966
COMMENT FOR ME- MMHM THE GOAL

00:40:36.033 --> 00:40:37.635
IS TO MAKE THEIR CLEAN AT THE

00:40:37.701 --> 00:40:39.103
END OF THE DAY AND IN EVERY

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.905
LOCALITY BUT SOME LOCALITIES

00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:43.140
HAVE SOME VERY CHALLENGING.

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:44.842
DEMOGRAPHICS JUST BECAUSE OF

00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:47.578
THE SIERRAS AND THE WAY THE AIR

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:49.313
LIGHT LIES IN THE BASIN AND YOU

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.184
AND- SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS-

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.418
FOR ME IT'S OF IT'S ABOUT HOW

00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:55.686
WE SPEND THE RESOURCE WE HAVE

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:56.854
YOU KNOW I'VE OBVIOUSLY

00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:58.923
THERE'S- NO SECRET THAT I'M NOT

00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:00.925
A BIG FAN OF THE- THE BULLET

00:41:00.991 --> 00:41:03.093
TRAIN OR THE VALLEY TRAIN

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.962
SYSTEM ON I THINK WE SHOULD BE.

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:06.497
SPENDING THOSE RESOURCES IN

00:41:06.564 --> 00:41:07.565
AREAS WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:10.100
REDUCE. THE CARBON OUTPUT- AND

00:41:10.167 --> 00:41:12.002
MOVE PEOPLE IN PLACES LIKE SAN

00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:17.708
FRANCISCO THE AND LA. SO- SO

00:41:17.775 --> 00:41:18.742
THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF

00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:23.547
MONEY. GOING TO- THESE PROGRAMS

00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:25.416
AND I'M NOT OPPOSED TO IT BUT I

00:41:25.482 --> 00:41:26.283
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.352
HOLISTIC APPROACH TO HOW WE

00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:31.355
ACTUALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND

00:41:31.422 --> 00:41:32.122
I KNOW THAT THOSE FOLKS IN

00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:34.058
THOSE COMMUNITIES. ARE VERY

00:41:34.124 --> 00:41:35.292
FRUSTRATED I'VE HEARD THEM OVER

00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:36.694
THE YEARS OPPOSE EVENING

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.129
LEGISLATION I WAS WORKING ON TO

00:41:39.196 --> 00:41:43.033
DO STUFF WITH- WITH BIOMASS-

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.568
AND THEY POSE PLANTS IN THEIR

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:46.270
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY PUT

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:47.805
OFF CARBON BUT IT WAS BETTER A

00:41:47.872 --> 00:41:48.672
HECK OF A LOT BETTER THAN OPEN

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:50.975
BURNING. SO JUST SOME COMMENTS

00:41:51.041 --> 00:41:52.376
I AM I WANT TO SOLVE THE

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:53.711
PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT. THE

YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST

00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:57.481

OF IMPROVE I TALK ABOUT THE ACT-

00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:30.614
NEXT TONS OF GREENHOUSE GAS

00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:32.516
EMISSIONS EQUIVALENTS THAT ARE

VALUE ADD AS IT AS AN EXAMPLE

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:43.585
SINCE WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE

01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:45.754
CHIEF HERE AND- AND OUR FIRE

01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:48.090

HOUSE WHEN THEY DO A RISK

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:06.141
MAPPING PROJECT WHEN THEY LOOK

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.709
IT'S A FIRE RISK IN AN AREA

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.478
THAT WOULD TO A CONSULTANT AND-

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:11.947
PUT BACK TOGETHER TECHNICALLY

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:13.882
FOR A COUNTY OR CITY AND GATHER

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:16.785

WILL- IT SEEMS TO ME A REALLY.

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:34.903
EXCITING SYNTHESIS OF WHAT

YOU'RE YOU'RE PUTTING FORWARD

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:38.540
HERE WHERE AND YOU CAN YOU CAN

OF THE RESILIENCY FRONTS RIGHT

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:44.112
IT'S NOT JUST WILD FIRE USED AS

01:14:44.179 --> 01:14:46.515
AN EXAMPLE BUT- TO HAVE. THIS

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:47.983
SORT OF BUT CLIMATE RISK

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:49.952

LONG TERM LAND USE PLANNING.

01:14:53.388 --> 01:14:58.293
BUT THE SHORT TERM. CLIMATE

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.595
DISASTER. PRE HAZARD. IF YOU

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:01.697
WILL RIGHT IF WE CAN DO THAT

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:12.274
LOCALLY. WE'RE GONNA END UP

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:13.942
SAVING LIVES THIS RESEARCH I

01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:15.811
MEAN I SO I JUST I DON'T MEAN

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:16.845
TO INDULGE TOO MUCH IN THAT

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:17.913

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:20.349
THE CLIMATE ASSESSMENT ITSELF

01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:21.149

01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:51.046
KIND OF AREA OF THIS KIND OF

01:15:51.113 --> 01:15:52.814

OF BETTER UNDERSTANDING- AND

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:10.432
SORT OF PLANNING WHAT THE RISKS

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:12.200
ARE WHERE THEY ARE AND HOW TO

01:16:12.267 --> 01:16:13.568
POSITION RESOURCES HOW TO SORT

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:15.570
OF INVEST RESOURCES IN A WAY TO

KIND OF. REDUCE THAT RISK MOST

01:16:18.173 --> 01:16:19.441
EFFECTIVELY IS AN ISSUE THAT I
