THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM SPEAKER. TODAY I RISE TO ADJOURN IN THE MEMORY OF YOUR MEANS ASKING DOWN. ALSO KNOWN AS NIPSEY HUSSLE WHO WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED ON MARCH THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY NINETEEN NIPSEY WAS A RESIDENT OF THE FIFTY FOURTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. NANCY WAS BORN AUGUST FIFTEENTH HE WAS A LEO. NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND RAISED IN THE HYDE PARK NEIGHBORHOOD OF SOUTH LA. HE ATTENDED SCHOOLS IN THE CITY INCLUDING JOHN BURROUGHS MIDDLE SCHOOL. GRAMMY NOMINATED RAPPER NIPSEY HUSSLE SAID IN ONE OF HIS LYRICS FIND YOUR PURPOSE OR YOU'RE WASTING AIR. NIPSEY WAS KNEE DEEP IN FINDING HIS PURPOSE WHEN HE WAS KILLED. HE WAS A PIONEER. HE UNDERSTOOD THE HEARD FROM WHICH HE CAME. AND IT NEITHER REBUKED IT NOR FOR GOT IT IN HIS QUEST FOR REDEFINING SELF DETERMINATION AN ENTREPRENEURIAL ISN'T ON HIS OWN TERMS. HE PLAYED THE LONG GAME ONCE TELLING SOMEONE THAT HE FIRST HEARD OF SNOOP DOGG RAP AT AGE NINE AND IT WASN'T UNTIL HE WAS THIRTY THREE THAT HE RELEASED HIS FIRST STUDIO ALBUM. IN TWENTY TEN THE A CLAIM HE HAS A CLAIM MIX TAPE BULLET SAYING GOT NO NAME VOLUME TO RECEIVE GREAT NOTORIETY LANDING HIM ON THE COVER OF THE FRESHMAN X. X. ELLE MAGAZINE. A MAJOR MILESTONE FOR EMERGING HIP HOP ARTISTS. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN HE SOLD ONE THOUSAND MIX TAPES OF HIS ALBUM CRENSHAW FOR A HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH. ON FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN NIPSEY RELEASED HIS HIGHLY ANTICIPATED GRAMMY NOMINATED DEBUT ALBUM VICTORY LAP WHICH WAS A CULMINATION OF ALL TWELVE OF HIS MIXTAPES INCLUDING THE MARATHON SERIES. BUT HE WAS MORE THAN A MUSICIAN AND RAPPER HE WAS ALSO AN ENTREPRENEUR DEVELOPER TECH MAVERICK INVESTOR ROLE MODEL. ALWAYS WHILE STAYING TRUE TO THE GAME AND TO HIS COMMUNITY. NIPSEY OPEN THE MARATHON STORE A CLOTHING STORE IN CRENSHAW THAT IS THE WORLD'S FIRST SMART STORE. HE BUILT BASKETBALL COURTS TO THROUGH OUT THE FIFTY FOURTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT HE WAS A PARTNER IN DESTINATION CRENSHAW A MULTI MILE LONG PUBLIC ART PROJECT. ANY PARTNERED WITH THAT BURGER ON CRENSHAW LOGO DESIGNS FOR UNIFORMS. NIPSEY ALSO INVESTED IN SEVERAL BUSINESS VENTURES IN SOUTH LA INCLUDING THE RE OPENING OF THE WORLD ON WHEELS SKATING RINK. TO RESTAURANTS AND SLAWSON IN CRENSHAW A BARBER SHOP AND VECTOR NINETY ONE OF THE FIRST WORK SPACES IN INCUBATORS AND SOUTH LA DESIGNED TO SUPPORT BLACK AND BROWN BROWN ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN SOUTH LA. HE SAID HE WANTED TO MAKE CRENSHAW FEEL LIKE FAIRFAX AND HE WANTED TO ATTRACT BUSINESS TO AREAS DEEMED UNSAFE OR FORGETTABLE [inaudible] IRONICALLY. NIPSEY WAS GUNNED DOWN BY THE STREET [inaudible] NOTHING. ABOUT A PREMATURE DEATH. EVER FEELS FAIR. OR JUST. HIS DEATH WAS TRAGIC AND UNNECESSARY. THE KIND OF KILLING THAT HAPPENS WHEN FOLKS FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE. AND FOR CRENSHAW THIS KIND OF SELF INFLICTED PAIN. HURTS THE MOST. USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE MAKE IT. THEY GET OUT OF THE HOOD. BUT GETTING OUT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN GETTING SAFE. NIPSEY IS LIVE. WASN'T ABOUT ASKING WHY WE SHOULD LEAVE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. HIS LIFE WAS ABOUT ASKING WHY NOT INVEST IN THEM. IN DEMAND THAT OTHERS DO AS WELL. HAVING HAD A LONG HISTORY IN GETTING CULTURE NIPSEY COMMUNICATED TO A DEMOGRAPHIC OF PEOPLE OFTEN OVERLOOKED. AND DISMISSED BY MOST OF SOCIETY. THESE ARE BLACK AND BROWN MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE RAISED AN UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT FEEL THAT THE BULLET IS THE ONLY OPTION IN LIFE. AND SURVIVING BY ANYTHING THAT'S NECESSARY IS ALL THAT WE CAN DO. MY HOPE IS THAT SOMEONE FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SOMEONE WHO HAS SOME JUICE LIKE NIPSEY HUSSLE. TAKES UP THE MANTLE AND BUILDS ON THE LEGACY THAT HE WAS DEVELOPING FOR CRENSHAW FOR THE FIFTY FOURTH AND FOR ALL OF US THAT COME FROM THOSE COMMUNITIES. MY HEART AND CONDOLENCES GO OUT TO HIS FAMILY INCLUDING HIS SON CROSS HIS DAUGHTER IMANI HIS FIANCEE LAUREN HIS MOTHER AND HIS FATHER HIS BROTHER SAM HIS SISTER SAMANTHA. AND HIS ENTIRE TEAM.
