WHILE PROVIDING MULTIPLE BENEFITS TO THEIR BUSINESSES LANDING COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER. FARMERS AND RANCHERS HAVE TOLD US LOUD AND CLEAR BASED ON THEIR EXPERIENCE FOR THE FIRST ROUNDS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM'S. THAT THE LACK OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE FOR THEM HAS LIMITED THEIR PARTICIPATION. AND IN SOME CASES PREVENTED THEM IN THE STATE FOR MAXIMIZING IMPACTS OF THEIR PROJECTS IN TERMS OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. WATER AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND THE ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL SAVINGS. BY INTEGRATING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INTO THE PROGRAMS.

IT WAS ONE SPANISH SPEAKING FARMER WHO CAME TO ONE OF OUR WORKSHOPS AND HE SAID HE WAS TRYING TO HELP OTHER SPANISH SPEAKING FARMERS. BUT HE COULDN'T FIND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THEM IN SPANISH.

MISTER CHAIR JUST MONTHS THE CUT CALIFORNIA COMPOST COALITION WE ARE REMOVING OPPOSITION AND THE AND ONE OF THE REASONS WE DID RAISE THAT IS BECAUSE AS I'M MANY OF YOU KNOW. THERE IS A MANDATE ON ORGANIC RECYCLING AND WE ARE 䥢CERNED THOUGH MUCH OF THIS MATERIAL HASN'T BEING CONSIDERED A SOLID WASTE ISN'T NESS RECOUNTED IN THE WASTE STREAM. THERE'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATION ON EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA TO DIVERT THIS WASTE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ON THE ACCOUNTING OF THIS WASTE. THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE COUNTING THIS THIS IS A LARGE VOLUME OF MATERIAL WE NOT SAYING IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED SOLID WASTE BUT AS WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WAY WE HANDLING THIS ORGANIC MATERIAL.

BILL IS OUT FOR GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ALRIGHT NEXT UP IS MISTER GRAYSON. AND YOU HAVE A TWO BILLS UP. ITEM NUMBER TWO. AB IN NINETEEN OH FIVE WHICH. I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO PRESENT. FOR HEARING PURPOSES ONLY AND NOT FOR A VOTE IS THAT CORRECT MR GRACE. THAT IS CORRECT. AND YOU ALSO HAVE ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN. AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY. WHICH WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROCEED WITH WORSE. I WILL PROCEED WITH A. BILL NUMBER AB NINETEEN ZERO FIVE ALRIGHT. ITEM NUMBER TWO. FLOOR IS YOURS. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. ALTHOUGH I'VE DECIDED TO NOT ASK FOR A VOTE ON AB NINETEEN ZERO FIVE AT THIS TIME. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON THE NEED FOR THIS BILL AND THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE TO DATE. THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM IS THE RESULT OF EXTENSIVE COLLABORATION BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT NORMALLY SEE WORKING TOGETHER. TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS TRANSIT BEHIND THIS BILL LIES A SIMPLE PREMISE. THAT G.. IMPACTS ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO THE CAT TO CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT AND THAT MOBILE SOURCES ARE THE LARGEST SOURCE OF THOSE EMISSIONS. TO THAT END WE ATTEMPTED TO CRAFT LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS THAT WERE BOTH PART OF A REGIONAL STRATEGY TO REDUCE GHGS. AND WERE DESIGNED TO REDUCE CAR TRIPS ON A PROJECT LEVEL TO MOVE FORWARD EXPEDITIOUSLY. AB NINETEEN ZERO FIVE DOES NOT INHIBIT THE SEQUEL PROCESS IN ANY WAY. PROJECTS THAT REQUIRE AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT WILL STILL BE REQUIRED TO MITIGATE FOR IMPACTS HAVE A ROBUST PUBLIC INPUT PROCESS. THAT CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES WHAT AB NINETEEN ZERO FIVE DOES IS REQUIRED PROJECTS ARE FIXED NOT SIMPLY STOPPED WHEN A PROBLEM IS FOUND WITH THE E. IR. IT APPLIES THE ADJUNCTIVE RELIEF PROVISIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD PREVIOUSLY GRANTED TO PROJECTS LIKE THE KINGS ARENA. THE WARRIOR SERENA AND THE CAPITOL BUILDING ITSELF THE GREEN TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT BECAUSE STOPPING PROJECTS IS EXPENSIVE ACCORDING THE CALTRANS INDEED GS ESTIMATES? A YEAR LONG DELAY CAN ADD UP TO FOUR PERCENT TO THE COST OF THE PROJECT WHEN A PROJECT COST ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. WELL YOU CAN DO THE MATH. IF YOU'LL REFER TO YOUR HANDOUT THE LA JOH IDENTIFIED AT LEAST TWO PROJECTS COSTING OVER A BILLION DOLLARS THAT THIS BILL WOULD APPLY TO THAT WERE STOPPED DO THE SECRET LIT A SEQUEL LITIGATION. CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION AND A LIGHT RAIL IN SAN DIEGO. BOTH OF THESE PROJECTS WERE DETERMINED TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED TAKING CARS OFF THE ROAD BOTH OF THEM WERE INCLUDED IN REGIONAL PLANS TO REDUCE GHGS. AND BOTH OF THEM WERE STOPPED FOR OVER A YEAR BECAUSE THEY WERE ULTIMATELY OWE IT BEFORE THEY WERE ULTIMATELY ALLOWED TO PROCEED. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES DO WE WANT PROJECTS OF THIS MAGNITUDE. WITH THESE LARGE SCALE BENEFITS TO OUR ENVIRONMENT CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO INJUNCTION BECAUSE OF A LAW DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. CAN WE REACH OUR CLIMATE CHANGE IN AIR QUALITY GOALS THIS WAY. AND AS WELL CAN WE TELL OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT WE ARE USING THEIR TAX DOLLARS IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY ABOUT NINETEEN AB NINETEEN ZERO FIVE. S. B. ONE PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNDING FOR TRANSIT THE TRANSIT AND INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM ALONE. WERE RECEIVED FIVE OR THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FROM S. B. ONE MONEY THESE COMPETITIVE GRANTS FUND PROJECTS THAT MODERNIZE TRANSIT SYSTEMS INCREASE RIDERSHIP REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND IMPROVE SAFETY. A MINIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THIS FUNDING IS DEDICATED TO PROVIDE DIRECT BENEFIT TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IS IT FAIR TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS MONEY IS GOING TO BE EATEN UP BY COST INFLATION WHILE THE PROJECT LANGUAGE WAS IN COURT. I WANT TO THANK THE ADVOCATES WITH PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE THAT ARE TRANSFORM CLIMATE PLAN FOR THEIR EFFORTS ON TAILORING THIS BILL SO THAT IT ONLY APPLIES TO PROJECTS WOULD TANGIBLE IMPORTANT BENEFITS TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THEIR WILLINGNESS TO STEP ACROSS THE TRADITIONAL LINES OF WORK TOWARDS AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF THINKING THAT WILL BE NECESSARY. IF THIS STATE IS GOING TO ADAPT AND THRIVE IN A CHANGING CLIMATE. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM NOT ASKING FOR A VOTE ON THIS MEASURE AT THIS TIME. BUT I DO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS UPCOMING YEAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VERY MUCH AND. YOU HAVE WHAT'S WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NO WITNESSES HELPING. OR DOING I GUESS WE DO. WILL TAKE A WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GAP IN CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MANY MITCHELL FULL BORE HA AND I'M AN ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH A CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. WE HAVE TO COMMEND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON AND STAFF FOR SPEARHEADING THIS POLICY IDEA AND DEVELOPING THIS CONVERSATION TO HELP STREAMLINE SEQUEL ALSO PER SERVING. PROJECT DELIVERY. WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT STRIKE A BALANCE IN DELIVERING THE BENEFITS OF A TRANSPORTATION PROJECT WHILE MEANINGFULLY ADDRESSING. ITS POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WITHOUT THE COSTS AND DELAYS CHIU TO LITIGATION. ARE WE RAIN REMAIN COMMITTED AND HOPEFUL TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND A STAFF AND IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED COMMITTEE MEMBERS I MATTHEW BAKER POLICY DIRECTOR FOR PLANNING CONSERVATION LEAGUE WE DID NOT TAKE A FORMAL POSITION ON THIS BILL AS OF YET BUT. WE DID PARTICIPATE A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STAFF AND WE APPRECIATE THEIR EFFORTS TO MAKE THIS. A STRONGER BILL WE HAD CONCERNS IN THE BEGINNING BUT WE NEED SUPPORT THE INTENT OF TRYING TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO. PROJECTS THAT MEET STATE GOALS FOR FEE IMPERIAL ACTION AND WE AND WE THOUGHT THAT THE AS AMENDED WITH HEAD IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO. THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CONCEPT SOME THANK YOU. IN THE STATE OF ALL CHECK ON BEHALF OF SUNBURN AND YOU KNOW COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND BEEN TURNED COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION IN SUPPORT. ADAM RIGHTLY WITH CAL CHAMBER ALSO IN SUPPORT OF BILL. RIGHT AND WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FOR. HOW JONES IS HERE CLUB CALIFORNIA YOU HAVEN'T POSITION ON THE BILL UP FOR A LOT OF REASONS I THINK A LOT OF THE COMMITTEE HEARD LAST WEEK REGARDING INJUNCTIONS AND HOW THEY CAN PROTECT THE PUBLIC OUT WE JUST WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR PUTTING A POSITIVE EVERYTHING AND? HOPE THAT WE HAVE FOR FULL DISCUSSIONS OF THE INNER. AFTERNOON TURNED MEMBERS DAN POEM FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ALSO IN SUPPORT YOU HEARD LAST WEEK THE COUNCIL'S CONCERNS ARE NOT FOCUSED ON SEQUEL OR THE MAYOR TO THE PARTICULAR PROJECTS. THAT WOULD BE COVERED ARE FOCUSES SOLELY ON THE COURT IMPACTS OF LEGISLATION. UP LIKE THIS SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN THERE HAVE BEEN. ABOUT THIRTY BILLS INTRODUCED FOLLOWING EITHER AB NINE HUNDRED OR SB TWO NINETY TWO OF THOSE THIRTY BILLS EIGHTEEN INCLUDING THIS BILL HAD THE PROPOSED LIMITS ON INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THE COUNCIL'S CONCERNS ARE THAT THE COURT HAS BROUGHT EQUITABLE POWERS IN SECRET AND ANOTHER MATTERS TO FASHION. THE APPROPRIATE LEAVE BASED ON THE FACTS AND THE LAW IN FRONT OF THE JUDGE IN THIS PARTICULAR. CATEGORY OF OF. LEGISLATION LIKE THIS PARTICULAR BILL AM IT SAYS THAT ONLY IF THE PROJECT WOULD RESULT IN A THREAT OF IMMINENT HARM TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH. OR INTERFERE WITH NATIVE AMERICAN ARTIFACTS OF THE COURT WOULD BE PRECLUDED FROM. FASHIONING AN INJUNCTION BASED ON THE FACTS IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE WHICH THEY OFTEN DO IN THESE CASES THEY ISSUE TARGETED INJUNCTIONS IT IS FOR THOSE REASONS THE COUNCIL'S. ALRIGHT ANY ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SEEING NONE QUESTIONS. COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MS LAMONT. AS ONE IT THINK THE AUTHOR I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU TO THE DISTRICT TO CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK AND YOUR APPROACH TO REALLY TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT THINK. WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM AS MEMBERS BUT ALSO TO ENGAGE BOTH THE OPPOSITION AND THE SUPPORTERS A THINK? IS VERY YOU KNOW NOTABLE. AND IMPORTANT IN THIS AND SO. I WISH YOU KNOW ALL OF US LUCK IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE'S A PATHWAY TO HELP. YOU KNOW OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM A HOUSING SYSTEM SO MANY OTHER AREAS. AND DOING IT IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH ALSO PROTECTING SOME OF THE LAWS THAT. YOU KNOW SOME COMMUNITIES FIND PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN AND HELPING US KEEP THE ENVIRONMENT AYE WHAT IT IS SO I THINK YOU THINK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'D LIKE TO. CONCLUDE THIS SAID DISCUSSION FOR TODAY. BY JOINING THIS LIMB ON AND THANKING YOU MISTER GRAYSON FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS EFFORT TO. BRING THE NONTRADITIONAL STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER TO. TRY TO OF FURTHER EXPLORE. SEEK REFORM. AS I'VE INDICATED. IN THE PREVIOUS MEETING AND THE IN THE PAST I M.. CERTAINLY OPEN TO ANY AND ALL SEEK REFORM IDEAS. BUT MY. PRIMARY CONCERN WITH WITH YOUR BILL WAS AS LAID OUT IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. YOU WHILE YOU HAVE ADDRESSED THE GHG EMISSIONS OR ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS A GHG EMISSION CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL AS THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. THOSE ISSUES THERE ARE AS WE DISCUSSED EIGHTEEN. FACTORS ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT THAT THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED UNDER SEQUEL. AND FOR ME A MOST IMPORTANT WHERE THE TWO THAT WERE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES SUCH AS. POTENTIAL TOXICS IMPACTS OR WATER QUALITY IMPACTS INYO SO THOSE ARE JUST A TO. OF OF MANY EXAMPLES OF. THE REASON WHY. SEQUEL. REFORMERS BEEN SUCH A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK AND THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT YOU SHE'S IN ABOUT VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED BUT. HOW DO WE? BALANCE THE. PROTECTIONS THAT SEEK WERE. OFFERS WHO WITH THE DESIRE TO ATTEMPT TO ELIMINATE THE ABUSES OF SEQUEL AND I THINK THAT IS THE REAL CHALLENGE THAT. YOU ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND THAT WE APPRECIATE. YOUR EFFORTS PACKAGER. NEXT SO WE HAVE A ITEM FIFTEEN. A. B.. THIRTY ONE SIXTY AND. YES. AND WE DO HAVE WITNESSES COMING. AGAIN GOOD AFTERNOON. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY ONE SIXTY WHAT'S WILL EXEMPT THE SALE OR LEASE OF SPECIFIC FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROPERTIES.

I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS LEGISLATION. AND AYE AYE I DO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS PER THEIR ANALYSIS. MEMBERS A. B. THIRTY ONE SIXTY PROVIDES A VERY LIMITED EXEMPTION FOR SPECIFIC FEDERAL MILITARY INSTALLATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE PARTICIPATING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

THE CITY OF CONCORD IS THE LOCAL REDUCE AUTHORITY FOR THIS FORMER MAYBE BETTER A NAVAL BASE AND HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE US NAVY FOR OVER THIRTEEN YEARS. ON THE BASIS TRANSFERRED TO LOCAL CONTROL AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY EIGHT WOULD EXEMPT THIS FEDERAL PROPERTY FROM RECENTLY ENACTED STATE LAW.

OF RESIDENT PARTICIPATION IN THIS DECISION AND GETTING US TO THIS POINT. THE BRAKE SYSTEM AS IT FUNCTIONS IN OUR CITY. IS SOMETHING WHICH ALLOWS FOR LOCAL CONTACT AND ALLOWS US TO ADVANCE TO CHANGE WHAT IS CLEARLY. A UNDESIRABLES ACTUATION IN OUR LAND AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. SOMETHING THAT IS BOTH PRODUCTIVE AND FALLS WITHIN THE VALUES AND THE QUALITY OF PRIORITIES THAT WE IN THIS STATE. HAVE BEEN PROUD TO HOLD. IT WOULD BE UNFORTUNATE IF AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF A BILL DESIGNED TO PROTECT. WOULD BE USED TO DELAY. THE ACTUAL CREATION. OF A VALUABLE ASSET TO THE ENTIRE STATE. EVERYONE IN CONTRA COSTA EAST BAY WILL BENEFIT FROM OUR PROJECT. THE BRAC SYSTEM HAS WORKED WITH US. LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS WORKED WITH THE PEOPLE. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH US. WE UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE AND THE PROBLEMS THAT BROUGHT ABOUT. SP FIFTY. THEY DON'T EXIST IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE AND WOULD BE A SERIOUS DISAPPOINTMENT TO MY CONSTITUENTS.

THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY THREE. MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES I COME BEFORE YOU TODAY TO PRESENT A. B. THIRTY ONE THIRTY THREE A BILL WHICH WOULD ADD THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES. AS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD WHEN NATURAL RESOURCE RELATED MATTERS ARE UP FOR CONSIDERATION. THE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING AN IMPROVING THE LAND ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS FOR MOST STATE DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING LAND FOR STATE FIRE STATIONS CRIMINAL JUSTICE FACILITIES AND PUBLIC SAFETY RADIO COMMUNICATION SITES. TO NAME JUST A FEW RECENT PROJECTS. AS PART OF ITS CHARGE THE BOARD HERE'S AND DECIDES UPON ACQUISITION OF REAL PROPERTY OR CONSTRUCTION OF PROJECTS FOR ENTITIES. UNDER THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY THAT ARE INTENDED TO IMPROVE NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROTECT LANDS OR PROVIDE RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES. WHILE LAND ACQUISITIONS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN NATURAL RESOURCES HAVE COMMON COMPONENTS. THE PROGRAMMATIC GOALS OF NATURAL RESOURCES PROJECTS MAY BE UNIQUE FROM OTHER ISSUES WITHIN THE BOARD'S JURISDICTION. AND THE EXISTING MEMBERSHIP OF THE BOARD. WHICH IS THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE THE DIRECTOR OF CALTRANS IN THE DIRECTOR OF GENERAL SERVICES. DO NOT HAVE SPECIFIC EXPERTISE IN THESE MATTERS. THIS BILL WOULD ADD THE SECRETARY OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY IS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD WHEN IT IS CONSIDERING MATTERS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION A PROPERTIES OR CONSTRUCTION OF PROJECTS UNDER THE JURISDICTION. OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. THE ADDITION OF THE SECRETARY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ENSURE THAT THERE IS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD THAT CAN SPEAK TO THE RESOURCES RELATED OR CONSERVATION GOALS OF THE PROJECT. BECAUSE THE ADDITION OF THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES WILL CREATE A BOARD WITH AN EVEN NUMBER OF MEMBERS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A TIE VOTE. THE BILL WILL PROVIDE THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE BOARD OF THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE SHALL CAST THE DECIDING VOTE UNDER SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE. THE BILL WOULD NOT EXPAND THE JURISDICTION OF THE BOARD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD THE BILL IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF A PROJECT UNDER CONSIDERATION. IT WOULD HOWEVER AND SWORE THAT THERE IS A ROBUST DISCUSSION OF THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES THEREFORE I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS RECALL MONSTER DID NOT A WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND. OF THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT DOES A LOT OF LAND ACQUISITIONS AND CERTAINLY HAS DONE A LOT OF LAND ACQUISITIONS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WERE. YOU KNOW. INTIMATELY AWARE OF THE. VALUE OF THESE LANDS AND AND AND THE IMPACTS. ACQUISITIONS CAN HAVE OR PROJECTS CAN HAVE IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME THAT THE.

WHILE AT TIMES THE PROJECTS THAT A PROPOSED ARE GOOD FITS FOR THE PROGRAM. OTHER FOLKS ARE JUST NOT APPLYING IT COMPLAINING THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING A FAIR SHAKE. AT THESE DOLLARS. OTHER TIMES APPLICANTS ARE PUTTING IN THE WORK AND NOT BEING SUCCESSFUL DO TO LIMIT FUNDING AND THE WAY THE APPLICATION'S GOING. PROCESS PRIORITIZE PROJECTS I ISSUES RELATED TO DENSITY ABOUT BEING ONE OF THEM. THIS PARTICULAR BILL MAKE SMALL CHANGES THAT WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR COMMUNITIES ATTEMPTING TO COMPETE FOR THESE RESOURCES. AS FOR SPECIFIC AREAS. THAT WRE ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE IN THIS PROPOSAL FIRST WE'RE EXPANDING THE LIST OF CO BENEFITS THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAS BEEN DEVELOPING IN CONSULTATION WITH ACADEMICS. AND MINISTERING AGENCIES TO ENSURE IT CAPTURES ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES. THAT WE HAVE TO LINE THESE INVESTMENTS WITH OTHER COMMUNITY STATE PRIORITIES.

OF AB SIX ONE SEVEN I GIVE PREFERENCE FOR RESOURCES AS WELL. THE THIRD ARE ALLOWING OUR BORDER REGIONS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S IMPERIAL AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY.

NEXT WE HAVE MS AND YOUR CURRY ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN. THIS IS A SUPPORT SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I WOULD TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN. I WILL BE ACCEPTING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS THEY HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO YOU TODAY. AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN WILL PROMOTE HOLISTIC A COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS LONG TERM FORESTRY MANAGEMENT. REDUCIBLE WILDFIRE RISKS BY EXPANDING WOOD PRODUCT MARKETS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL WILL INCENTIVIZE PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN FOREST HEALTH. WHICH IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. PREVENT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. DEVELOP RURAL ECONOMIES AND PROMOTE OUR CLIMATE GOALS. SPECIFICALLY AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN DEFINES MASS TIMBER AND INNOVATIVE FOREST PRODUCTS IN STATE LAW AND ASK HOW FAR TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS BARRIERS TO MARKET EXPANSION. STATE ALONE CANNOT SUPPORT THE REMOVAL OF WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY KINDLING FOR FUTURE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. THIS BILL TAKES THE PARDON STEP TO HELP PRIVATE INDUSTRIES BECOME PARTNERS WITH THE STATE IN PREVENTING WILDFIRES IN PROMOTING HEALTHY FORESTS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I HAVE WITH ME TODAY KRISTIN KOPEC ME FROM CALIFORNIA'S ANALYSTS BOTH FORCED BROOK FROM NATURE CONSERVANCY. CARE SINGLE PICKY WITH THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL NEEDS FACING OUR FORCES ADDRESSING WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THE EXCESS YOU'LL AN OVERSTOCK STANDS THAT WE HAVE IN THE FOREST. AND BECAUSE OF EMERGENCY WHERE IN WE CANNOT AFFORD TO TURN AWAY SOLUTIONS WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT BIOMASS IS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO THE ISSUE OF EXCESS FUELS. WE BELIEVE THAT MASS TIMBER HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE AN ADDITIONAL SOLUTION THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO CREATE A VIABLE PRODUCT OF ONCE WAS PREVIOUSLY IN UNMARKETABLE MATERIAL. HISTORICALLY FORCE HAVE HAD APPROXIMATELY FORTY TREES PER ACRE MUCH OF CALIFORNIA'S FORCE LANDS ARE NOW WELL IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED TREES PER ACRE WHILE THERE ARE TOO MANY TREES. WHEN ARE TOO MANY TREES THEY COMPETE FOR RESOURCES DROUGHT STRESSES THESE TREES AND MANY DIRE BECOME VULNERABLE TO VULNERABLE TO INSECT ATTACKED. THAT'S WHY THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD TREES IN OUR FOR US TODAY. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN ENCOURAGE NEW INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS AND PRODUCTS THAT CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASE THE HEALTH AND RESILIENCY. OF OUR FOR FOR OVER FOREST'S CAL FORCES READY TO SUPPORT WE ASK FOR A VOTE. IF YOU. CHAIRMAN MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LESS FORCE PROGRAM WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK SO REMEMBER AT YOUR CURRY FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. SO I STATED WILDFIRES YOU GET LARGER AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE IN A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THESE. INCREASE THESE MEGA FIRES IS OVERLY DENSE FOREST WHICH ARE OVERGROWN WITH SMALL DIAMETER TREES DEAD AND DYING TREES AND WHAT IF I AM. GREATER INVESTMENT IS IN ECOLOGICALLY BASED THINNING AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS NEEDED. AND ONE WAY TO INCREASE INVESTMENT FORCE RESTORATION IS TO EXPAND THE WHAT PRODUCTS MARKET TO UTILIZE THIS MATERIAL REMOVED FROM THE FOREST. AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN DOES JUST THAT THE BILL PROMOTES MARKETS FOR NEW INNOVATIVE FOREST PRODUCTS THAT WOULD USE THE BLOODY MATERIAL FROM FORCE RESTORATION PROJECTS. AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN RECOGNIZES THE CRITICAL NEED TO EXPAND THE USE FOR WHAT PRODUCTS FOR PROMOTING FOREST HEALTH AND PROMOTING EEK ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU. MR MEMBERS BRIAN WHITE HERE FOR CALIFORNIA LAST LANCE FORSTER SOCIALIZATION AND ALSO THE FORCE LICENSE. OF CALIFORNIA WERE IN SUPPORT THE BILL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING MISS AMERICA IAN WITH A FORK. I MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRIS MCKAY THE ON BEHIND MY BEHALF OF HUMBLE MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES OLSON'S OF. GOOD AFTERNOON CORRIE BOSS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL CONSERVATION CORES IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN BREEZY SULLIVAN SALAS POTTER BEHALF OF THAT CALIFORNIA TAHOE ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS TRY ROBERT SPIEGEL CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION SUPPORT THANK YOU. ERIK KARLSSON ASSOCIATING CALIFORNIA LOGGERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THE VERY MUCH ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. PLEASE COME FORWARD. OCCUPY THE TWO FRONT SEATS HERE. A ALUMINUM STE SHARE. COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TIM PAYING ABOVE ST THINK THE NATIONAL READY MIX CONCRETE ASSOCIATION. AND I THINK. TO COMMITTEE FOR THE UP TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. TO THE BILL UNLESS AMENDED. THEN I'M CA A A PLUS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE FOR EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATION. AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS. WHILE MANAGING TO USE NATURAL RESOURCES BUT. THERE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS OF THE BILL REGARDING ITS ASSUMPTIONS. ESPECIALLY OF REGARDING MASS TIMBER AND I'VE WRITTEN. PUTTING TESTIMONY CORRECT SUMMIT IT UP BUT I'LL MAKE FOUR POINTS HERE. ONE IS THAT THE SCIENCE DOESN'T SUPPORT THE REMOVAL OF DEAD TREES. AMONG SCIENTISTS. THERE'S OLD OVERWHELMING CONSENSUS THAT THE DENSITY OF BIOMASS DOES NOT DETERMINE HOW WILDLAND FIRES. A BEHAVE. RESEARCHES AT NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY. UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT FOUND THE FORCE WERE HIGH SNAG LEVELS ACTUALLY TEND TO BURN LESS INTENSELY THAN OF THE FOREST. A MORE WITH THIS NAGGING WOODY BIOMASS CONTRIBUTE TO THE FORCE REJUVENATION AND BECOMES MICHAEL HABITATS FOR WILDLIFE. SECOND A MASS TIMBER IS A COMBUSTIBLE FIRE RISK. MASTABA BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN IMPLIED. IN MUCH LITERATURE AND ADVERTISING IT BEHAVES LIKE FIRE RESISTIVE MATERIAL. A INTO FIVE DOING FIRED DUE TO ITS HIRING LAYER. BUT A UNLIKE FIRE RESISTIVE MATERIALS THE COMBUSTIBLE TIMBER ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE FIRE LOW ACCELERATING THE FLASH OVER. SO MASTABA STRUCTURES ARE UNLIKELY TO SURVIVE THE FIERY EVENT. M. WILL HAVE TO BE DEMOLISHED AFTER THE FIRE. BUT THE THIRD POINT IS. MASS TIMBER IS A JOB CREATORS DOT PROVEN. BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT NEW MASS TIMBER PRODUCTS NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND EFFICIENCIES. A IN WOOD MANUFACTURING HAVE DISPLACED JOBS. INTO WOULDN'T SEE NOT THE LACK OF COMMAND. OF FINALLY. SUPPORTING. INNOVATION IS CERTAINLY ADMIRABLE OF BUT THE BILL IS A ZERO SUM GAME ECONOMICALLY. IT SEEKS TO PROTECT JOBS IN ONE SECTOR WHILE AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS WORKING IN DIFFERENT SECTORS WITHIN CALIFORNIA. PROVIDING ARTIFICIAL BENEFIT TO ONE MATERIAL CAN ONLY BE JUST A VALUE OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN THE STATE. AND WE BELIEVE LEGISLATION THAT USE TAX DOLLARS. TO DECIDE WINNERS OR LOSERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS INDUSTRY ARM. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS TOM TEATS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA SMITH ASSOCIATION. I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR LISTENING TO SOME OF OUR AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE OFFERED AND. IT REALLY AND MY COURAGE BY THAT DIALOGUE. WHEN THING WE APPLY IT IS THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. WE BELIEVE THAT ADDRESSING A WILDFIRE ISSUES IS VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL AS RURAL JOB CREATION. WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR INDUSTRY WE HAVE A LOT OF RURAL. PLANTS AND FEEL THAT'S OF IMPORTANT PLACE TO FOCUS. WE ALSO AS TEN MENTIONED ARE OUR PRODUCERS OF NON COMBUSTIBLE BUILDING MATERIALS. WHICH WE THINK IS IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION MOVING FORWARD. THE REASON WHY WE OPPOSE THIS BILL UNLESS AMENDED. IS THAT LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER WE FEEL IT'S NOT THE PLACE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PICK FAVORITES. WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING MATERIALS. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL SHOULD BE DONE THROUGH THE CODES PROCESS AND INDIVIDUAL DESIGN. ENTITIES. AND LASTLY WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS OUTLINED IN TERMS OF USING MASS TIMBER AND SOME OF THESE. INNOVATIVE BUILDING THAT MATERIALS. FOR SOLUTIONS USING THAT WOULD. THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY RECOMMENDED BY SOME OF THE REPORTS THAT HAVE SUBMITTED BEEN SUBMITTED TO CAL FIRE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT. IT WOULD BE SEEN THE RANKINGS IN TERMS OF FEASIBILITY AND DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THIS IS THE RIGHT TYPE OF SOLUTION MOVING FORWARD. BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED WORK ON THIS BILL MOVING AHEAD. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. CHARLIE RAY CALIFORNIA TO DESTRUCTION DUSTER MATERIALS ASSOCIATION WRIST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE WASN'T.

AND AGAIN I'M SORRY THAT I HAD TO LEAVE THE FOR THE LAST PRESENTATION FROM MYSTERY GARCIA AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK US WHEN THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO KEEP CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT ONE WERE. STATE IS BECAUSE WE ARE I AM WE AND WE THAT HAVE AS MANY ISSUES AS WE HAVE I THINK WE NEED TO BE AS CREATIVE AS WE CAN TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THEM. AND HAVING MARKETS FOR ALL THAT TIMBER AND ALL THE BIOMASS STEP THAT WE BRING OUT REPRESENTING AND AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT. IF WE'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING WITH IT THEN THERE'S OPEN FIRES AND IT JUST CONTINUES TO ACCUMULATE OR END UP IN OUR WE STREAM WHICH IS NOT THE PLACE FOR IT. FROZEN TREAT WITH THE LAST BILL. AND I CAN I THINK YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING HERE TO HAVE ALSO DONE SOMETHING WOOD WOOD PRODUCTS WE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ENCOURAGE. PEOPLE TO USE THIS THAT THAT THAT THE TRASH THAT WE HAVE THE WASTE THAT WE HAVE OTHERWISE IT JUST GOES INTO OUR ATMOSPHERE. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. HAVE A QUESTION FOR. THE. CEMENT INDUSTRY. REPRESENTATIVES HOW HOW HOW DOES. THAT THE TIMBER PRODUCTS. REPLACE OR COMPETE WITH. CEMENT PRODUCTS. OUR ALL STAR. IT'S ESSENTIALLY IS THE THEY ARE PROMOTINGIT AS A REPLACEMENT TO. COMBUSTIBLE NON COMBUSTIBLE CONSTRUCTION WHETHER ITS STEEL OR CONCRETE. IN TERMS OF HIGH RISES IN TERMS OF ALL THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS. THAT IS HOW THE MASS TIMBER IS BEING PROMOTED. SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IS THAT YOUR CURRY I THINK A. WE ARE PROPOSING MAKES TO ME THAT THE. WE HAVE A WILDFIRE CRISIS. TRYING TO. INCENTIVIZE DECLARING OF ACCESS. TIMBER.

TRULY ENGAGE COMMUNITIES WHICH CURRENTLY SHOULDER THE UNDUE BURDEN OF POLLUTION. THE CORE MESSAGE TO THIS BILL A SIMPLE. CALIFORNIA SHOULD PRIORITIZE BRINGING THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS TO IN THE STATE TO THE TABLE WHEN MAKING LOCAL LAND USE DECISIONS. CALMAR SCREEN CURRENTLY IN A THREE POINT OVER ZHAN IS A TOOL THAT ALLOWS US TO BETTER RECOGNIZE LINKAGES. BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND POVERTY IN ORDER TO INFORM DECISION DECISION MAKERS. AND THE PUBLIC. IF WE KNOW THAT AREAS WITHIN THESE COMMITTEES ARE NOT ONLY POLLUTED BUT ALSO MAY STRUGGLE TO BE ENGAGED IN THE TRADITIONAL SICK WERE PROCESS. GIVEN BARRIERS IN PLACE FOR PEOPLE OF LOW INCOME. PUBLIC POLICY SHOULD DO EVERYTHING IT CAN TO ENGAGE THEM IN THE PLANNING PROCESS. THIS BILL REPRESENTS A STEP TO ENSURE THAT AND WHAT CAN BE A CONFUSING PROCESS THE VOICES OF ALL COMMUNITIES ARE HEARD. I KNOW THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE BILL AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE PROVISIONS CURRENTLY BEING REFINED. SO THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE CLEAR. THIS BILL IS NOT MEANT TO INCLUDE HOUSING. ALTHOUGH AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY SEVEN IS LABELED A HOUSING KILLER I AM WORKING WITH OPPOSITION TO MAKE CLEAR THAT INCLUDING ANY TYPE OF RESIDENTIAL. DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE BILL BILLS REQUIREMENTS IS NOT ITS INTENT. MY STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO HONE THE SCOPE OF A SUBJECT LAND USE PROJECT. WE'RE ALSO IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHAT THEIR INTERPRETATION OF THE STATUTE AS WRITTEN WOULD BE WHEN DEVELOPING A LIST OF SUBJECT LAND USES. OUR LAST AMENDMENTS BEGAN THE PROCESS OF NARROWING THE SCOPE. QUALIFY PROJECTS AND THROUGH FURTHER DIALOGUE WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT NO PROJECT SHOULD INTENTIONALLY DISCRIMINATE. BUT AS AN ATTORNEY ALSO UNDERSTAND THE LEGAL DIFFICULTIES THIS SECTION OF THE BILL IN PRINT MAY CAUSE. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO FINE TUNE THIS PROVISION TO ADDRESS LEGAL CONCERNS. MEMBERS AND. THE CHAIR YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT THESE ARE ISSUES THAT I COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING. AS YOU WILL HEAR DESPITE CONCERNS WITH THE CURRENT BILL WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGING WITH OPPOSITION IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE CLOSE. TO FINDING COMMON GROUND THAT WILL ACCOMPLISH MY STATED GOAL OF ENGAGING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WITH THAT WITHOUT A HERE WITH ME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL ARE LEO MISIA'S. A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT CURRENTLY RESIDING IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. AND ASHLEY WARNER. SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. HELLO COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE PRESENT HERE TODAY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF WHY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE TO CIRCLE HAVE LEVEES LEGISLATURE LIKE AB TWENTY SEVEN. TWENTY FOUR FORTY SEVEN PASSED TO PROTECT THEIR HEALTH HOME AND NEIGHBORHOOD. MY NAME IS LEO MARTINEZ MUSAEUS I'M A PROUD HOMEOWNER IN FRESNO COUNTY AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MY COMMUNITY. A COMMUNITY IS OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE FACED WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. WHEN I PAT PURCHASE MY HOMIE NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN I DREAM OF RACE IN MY FAMILY IN A CLEAN SAFE. COMMUNITY WHERE MY CHILDREN GROW GRANDCHILDREN GROW UP TO FULFILL THEIR POTENTIAL. HOWEVER MY DREAM HAS ERODED OVER THE YEARS. ALL VARIETIES OF INDUSTRIAL PLANTS AND HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES PRONG UP AROUND MY COMMUNITY. BRING IT TOXIC AIR POLLUTION CONCEPT TRUCK TRAFFIC. AND CONTENT CONTAMINATING OUR WATER. WE WERE NEVER CONSULTED OR ASK BEFORE THEIR FACILITIES UP HERE AND STARTED TO IMPACT OUR QUALITY OF LIFE. NOW OUR COMMUNITY RATES IN THE HUNDRED PERCENTILE FOR POLLUTION BURDEN ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA EPA. BOTH MY SON AND I ALMOST ALL OF MY NEIGHBORS HAVE EXPERIENCED CANCER WHICH WE HAVE. WHICH WE THINK. HAVE TO DO WITH THAT TACTIC CONTAMINANTS INTO AARON TO SOIL AND THE WATER. TO MAKE MATTER WORSE THE PAST YEAR. THAT HALF OF THE FIFTIES ME TO MAKE IT WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED OUT A. YEARS THE YEAR AND A HALF FRESNO CD HAS APPROVED MILLIONS OF THE FEET A INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSES. SPACE ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND NEAR LOCAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. WE WERE NEVER TOLD ABOUT THIS PROJECT WHILE THE CD WAS PLANNING THEM. NOW THE DUSK I'M TO CONSTRUCT INITIAL CAN OUR AIR ENTRY WHERE IN OUR PAST. WE ARE TOLD THERE MORE THAN THOUSANDS A TRUCK BILL PASSED BY OUR HOOPS EVERY DAY BUT NOT WHAT WILL BE DONE. TO ENSURE THAT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS CAN WALK AND BIKE SAFELY OR TO KEEP OUR AIRPLANE IN OUR HOMES. WE WERE FEAR CONSEQUENCES OF THE PROJECT ON OUR WATER SUPPLY IN ARTICLES WE RELY ON SHALLOW DOMESTIC WELLS. AND ALL OF OUR NEIGHBOR'S WELLS WENT DRY DOING THEIR DROUGHT. BUT NO ONE ASKED US ABOUT THESE WHEN DEPRIVED TO VOTE THE BALLOT AND NO PROTECTION IT SEES. TO ENSURE WE WILL NOT WILL. LOSE WATER IN OUR HOMES WITH ALL OF THESE. CONDITIONS ARE BECOME IS SO BAD I FEAR OUR FAMILY FINALLY. YOU MAY NEED TO HAVE AND OUR GREEN. AT WAS BORN BACK IN NINETEEN TEXAS I WON I PURCHASED BY WHOM AT THE VERY LEAST FOR PROJECTS THAT CAN'T DO HARM PUBLIC HEALTH AND UNDERMINE OUR. NEIGHBORHOODS QUALITY OF HOLE OF HOMES DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LIKE BY. SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO A PUBLIC PROCESS IN WHICH ARE IMPERFECT QUESTIONS CONCERNED SUGGESTIONS OR TAKEN IN CONSIDERATION WHICH IT RECEIVED. A DIRECT NOTICE FROM IN LANGUAGES THAT OUR COMMUNITY SPIRIT WE WOULD GET START TO KNOW WHAT WILL BE BUILT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. HOW IT WILL AFFECT US THIS IS SOMETHING HAD ALL CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE ABLE TO AGREE ON I HAD PUT HIS SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH? HELLO COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT WHY MY ORGANIZATION AND ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE STATE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY SEVEN. MY NAME IS ASHLEY WARNER AND I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH IS THIS BILL SPONSOR. LEADERSHIP COUNCIL WORKS ALONGSIDE HUNDREDS OF RESIDENTS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ANNE'S COACHELLA VALLEY'S ADVOCATE FOR SOUND POLICY AND A RADICALLY INJUSTICE. TO SECURE EQUAL ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY REGARDLESS OF WEALTH RACE INCOME IN PLACE. LEADERSHIP COUNCIL IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE ALONG WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY IN THE FIREMEN. WERE ALSO HERE TODAY AND CAN SPEAK TO THE NEED FOR AND MERIT OF THIS BILL AS WELL. WE KNOW FROM OUR EXPERIENCE AND OUR WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT LEO STORY IS JUST ONE OF MANY STORIES WERE NEIGHBORHOODS HEALTH WELL BEING AND PUBLIC VOICE. IT'S SUBJUGATED TO DEVELOPMENT WITH SERIOUS ADVERSE IMPACTS. WHERE STATE LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE PUBLIC NOTICE OR MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR INPUT? THE VOICES OF THOSE RESIDENTS STAY SILENT AND SO TO THEIR CONCERNS. AS HAVE UNHEALTHY DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS NEXT TO SCHOOLS NEXT A HOMES CHILDCARE CENTERS PARKS AND YOUR HOUSES OF WORSHIP WITHOUT MEANINGFUL OF MITIGATION. THAT'S WE PERPETUATE DISPROPORTIONATE POLLUTION BURDENS DISPROPORTIONATE RATES OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC ILLNESS AND DISEASE AND SHORTER AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCIES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY SEVEN WOULD ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN ABOUT AND PROVIDE INPUT ON PROJECTS THAT MAY IMPACT THEIR HEALTH NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOMES.

SEQUEL BY ITS VERY NATURE IS A BILL OR EXCUSE ME THE STATUTE INTENDED TO ADDRESS TANGIBLE AND VERIFIABLE. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FROM PROPOSED PROJECTS THIS BILL RADICALLY EXPAND SEEK WERE TO ADDRESS IMPACTS THAT ARE NOT QUANTIFIABLE. BE REALLY FOR SLEEP AGENCIES TO DETERMINE THE INTENT. AND IT BE A FACT AT A STAGE IN WHICH. IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DO. SEE WERE. A. IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW FOR THE AGENCIES TO DEFEND A HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE FINDING SUCH AS. DISCRIMINATE. INTO ACTUAL DISCRIMINATION. OR DISCRIMINATORY EFFECT. AND WILL LEAD TO EXCESSIVE STEEPLE LITIGATION. WE ALSO OFFICIALLY OPPOSE AB TWO FOUR FOUR SEVEN BECAUSE THE GIVES DISCRETION STATE AGENCIES WITH LITTLE OR NO LAND USE UP POLICY EXPERIENCE. LAND USE IS A LOCAL CREATURE BECAUSE A LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE THE GREATEST KNOWLEDGE AS TO WHAT IMPACT THE COMMUNITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. AND FINALLY WE OPPOSE THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF PROJECT AS IN THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S AMBIGUOUS AND LIKELY LEADS TO FURTHER LITIGATION OVER HOW WE DEFINE WHAT PROJECT IS UNDER SEEK WELL. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CASSIE GILSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. I'M FOR SOMEONE I THINK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR REACHING OUT WAS VERY EARLY IN THE YEAR AND FOR THEIR ROBUST ENGAGEMENT WITH US THROUGHOUT THE DISCUSSIONS ON THE BILL TODAY. I'M CERTAINLY IF WE'RE ABLE TO AGREE ON AMENDMENTS THAT REMOVE HOUSING FROM THE BILL IT WOULD COME OFF OF HOUSING KILLER LIST. AND IT WOULD LEAVE US WITH SOME OF THAT MACABRE BROADER SEQUEL POLICY CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF TO RESOLVE THOSE GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. IF YOU. I MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARYANN WARMER DAM UP THE REAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. LIKE THE OTHERS WE DO APPRECIATE MS RAY THIS IS WORKING WITH LAST SUMMER HOPEFUL WE MIGHT FIND AN ACCOMMODATION. BUT WE BELIEVE THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IS ADDING ADDITIONAL PROCESS WHICH IN OUR EXPERIENCE. DOESN'T LEAD TO A BETTER OUTCOME AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE PROJECTS GENERALLY ARE WELL NOTICED WITHIN A COMMUNITY SO WE'RE HOPEFUL WE CAN FIND. AN INTERSECTION OF OUR IN TRUSTS IN GOOD LAND USE POLICY AND THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL COMMUNICATION BUT REGRETFULLY MUST CONTINUE TO BE A POST AT THIS. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS A LEGACY FOR THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION FOR SOME OF THE. REASONS STATED BUT ALSO LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON. PERHAPS FINDING SOME COMBINATION. YEAH COVERAGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS ALSO REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION BUT CONCERNED WITH HOW THIS MIGHT IMPACT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE AS EGGMAN. YEAH I THINK YOU AND THANK YOU MISTRESS FOR THAT BUT THE PRESENTATION. AND THE. ATTENTION TO THIS IS YOU I ALSO REPRESENT AN AREA THAT HAS A LARGE DISADVANTAGE COMMUNITY COMPONENT TO IT. AND. AND EXPERIENCE MYSELF WE WE HAVE VARIOUS SMELLS AT CIRCLE OUR NEIGHBORHOOD WE LIVE CLOSE TO PORT AND INDUSTRIAL AREAS SO IT'S PART OF. OUR LIVES AND AND WE DO A LOT OF BETH INTERNAL COMMUNICATION. I'M GONNA MOVE THIS BILL TODAY AND I'M I'M HOPING TO GET IT CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON WITH THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALSO FACING A HOUSING CRISIS. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE OUR BEST LAID PLANS. DON'T GET THE WAY OF OUR OTHER. VERY HIGH GOALS THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOWARD SO I TRUST EVEN CONTINUE WORK ON THIS AND FIND A WAY TO. TO THREAD THAT NEEDLE. BECAUSE CERTAINLY PEOPLE'S LIFE EXPECTANCY SHOULD NOT BE BASED ON THERE'S A COAT. AS MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. WHAT MS RAISE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH? ALL THE DIFFERENT. CONCERNS I HAVE BEEN RAISED BUT I'D. THERE ARE TWO THINGS I'M HOPING YOU CAN ADD SOME CLARITY TO FOR ME. WHAT I'M READING SAYS THAT ESSENTIALLY? A FULL BLOWN  <u><c.green>I ARE WOULD</c></u> HAVE TO BE DONE FOR BASICALLY EVERY PROJECT THAT NO NEGATIVE DECLARATIONS WOULD BE ACCEPTED WHICH. IS PROBLEMATIC AS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IS THAT YOUR INTENT. IN THIS BILL. AT THE BILL DOES NOT STATE THAT AND. IS THERE A SPECIFIC PROVISION THAT I'M. THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. SO AND AND JUST TO CLARIFY SO WHAT THE BILL DOES YEAH THE PART THAT SAYS HE BASED YOU'D HAVE TO. I MEET ALL THE STANDARDS SO THAT YOU WOULD GET TO THE POINT WHERE HE WOULDN'T EVEN REALLY BE ABLE TO ACCEPT A NEGATIVE. DECORATION. I'M WILL AT THE BILL CERTAINLY WOULD ALLOW NEGATIVE DECLARATION AS LONG AS IT'S YOU KNOW APPROPRIATE AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE LA ON THAT IT REQUIRES. NOTICE AND A SCOPING MEETING I'M REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A NEGATIVE DECLARATION OR ANY ARE IT'S BEING PREPARED. OKAY SO. THAT IS A GOOD POINT WITH A FAIR ARGUMENT STATEMENT CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE HOW ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO STOP. THIS PROJECT FROM GOING FORWARD OR AT LEAST FORCING A FULL III ARE. IT IT DOES NOT MODIFY THE STANDARDS UNDER WHICH AND A NEGATIVE DECLARATION VERSUS AN YEAH ARE WOULD HAVE TO BE PREPARED AND SO I WAS DOING IS ALLOWING OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESIDENTS TO PROVIDE THEIR INPUT ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF IMPACTS MILLION TO STAY IN THE AFTER YOU'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE. FEAR STANDARD STATEMENT THAT I ASKED I'D I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. OKAY IT'S OKAY WE CAN DISCUSS PERHAPS FURTHER ADAM OFFLINE. THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE THOUGH IS IT SAYS YOU. ONE MAKE SURE THE PROJECT WILL NOT INTENTIONALLY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A PROTECTED CLASS OR RESULT IN A DISCRIMINATORY EFFECT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. WELL AND AND IF YOU'D LIKE IT'S SIMPLY REFERENCING EXISTING LAW SO IT'S NOT CREATING YOU LIE THIS IS A LOT OF THE JURISDICTIONS MUST COMPLY WITH NOW ANYWAYS AND. AND SO IT SIMPLY HIGHLIGHTING THAT. EXISTING LEGAL OBLIGATION BUT AM AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STATED THAT IS A PROVISION THAT'S UNDER DISCUSSION I'M FOR POTENTIAL CHANGE. OKAY. COME. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER GLOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ON THIS BILL I WANT TO ASSOCIATE MY. THAT. FEELINGS ABOUT THIS WITH THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY MS EGGMAN. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE INTENDING TO AMEND THE BILL TO EXCLUDE HOUSING. OF FROM ITS PROVISIONS AND I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THAT'S A A STEP FORWARD. ORDINARILY WOULD NOT BE MY AND. INTENTION OR DESIRE TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF. A SECRET PROVISIONS AT A TIME WHEN. I THINK BECAUSE WE ALL SEE SOME ISSUES SAID THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED WITH WITH SEQUINS ARE MANY OF US TO. HOWEVER IN THIS CASE. BOB I THINK YOUR INTENTION IF I UNDERSTAND IT PROPERLY IS SET TO MAKE SURE THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. BOMBS ARE AWARE OF SEQUEL WHICH A A AND THE INTENTIONS REALLY PUT EVERYONE ANA A SIMILAR FOOTING CUT SOME COMMUNITIES. ARE. ARE ARE ARE BETTER ABLE TO GET THE WORD OUT. SURROUNDING PROJECTS. AND SOMETIMES THE NATURE OF THE PROJECT MAKES THAT TO MAKE THAT DIFFICULT SO I THINK THAT. OF THE INTENTION IS GOOD HERE I'LL BE WATCHING TO SEE WHAT AMENDMENTS ARE ARE MADE TO THE BILL AND RESERVE. A A JUDGMENT TO. AT AFTER A FUTURE STAGE SHOULD MAKE IT TO THE FLOOR RATHER COMMITTEE THAT I SERVE ON. THANK YOU DO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE INTENTION IS NOT TO INCLUDE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU. MS VARIOUS IDEA. APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK A WITH YOUR OPPOSITION. IN ADDITION TO. MS EGGMAN AND MR BLOOM'S CONCERNS ABOUT ADDING. TO SEEK WERE. WHEN. MOST OF OUR CONVERSATIONS BEEN. TRYING TO TAKE WITH THE OTHER DIRECTION. YEAH I I FULLY APPRECIATE THE INTENT. OF. AND THE GOAL OF A OF YOUR BILL THE MAIN GUY I THINK YOU TRY TO GO TO THE HEART OF. THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE MOVEMENT WHICH IS THAT. PLANNING AND LAND USE ISSUES. DID NOT HAVE A DISCRIMINATORY. IMPACT ON. PROTECTED COMMUNITIES. INSIGHTFUL APPRECIATE THAT I PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE THE. THE THE ENHANCE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE I I RECOGNIZE THAT. THAT. IMMIGRANT LONG CAN KEEP COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR. MADE. HAVE A. CHALLENGES THAT MAY NOT EXIST AND. OTHER COMMUNITIES. IN IN TERMS OF RECEIVING ADEQUATE NOTICE MY CONCERN US SPECIFICALLY ABOUT A GUY I DO A. SOUNDS LIKE I SHARE SOME CONCERNS WITH THEM AS MELENDEZ. THE. DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS A IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT SEQUEL IS BEING EXTENDED TO SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE. EITHER INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION ARE DESCRIPTIVE DISCRIMINATORY EFFECT. AND SO THIS IS OPENING. A WHOLE NEW. AREA OF POTENTIAL LITIGATION. WITH SEQUEL. I CAN CERTAINLY. SEE HOW IT MAY BE. EASIER TO PROVE INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION OR OR OR OR TO BE ABLE TO. TO IDENTIFY. EXAMPLES ARE EVIDENCE OF INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION. I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DISCRIMINATORY EFFECT. THEY THERE THERE IS SOME. POINT SOME DISCUSSION. THAT I READ ABOUT HOW DISCRIMINATORY EFFECT. IT WAS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS MADE HOW HOW CAN YOU FORESEE. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE OF IN A FOR. IF IF OF OF. OF A RETAILER. YOU KNOW. MOVED INTO THE. THAT THE LOCATION AND AND EVERYTHING APPEARED TO BE. FAIR AND NON DISCRIMINATORY ON ITS FACE BUT THEN SUBSEQUENTLY THE. THE THE OCCUPANT OR THE LOW OR THE THE. THE THE THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY OR THE OPERATOR THE PROPERTY IF THEY THEN PROCEED TO DISCRIMINATE THERE. IS IS THAT THE INTENT OF YOUR BILL TO. TRY TO ADDRESS. THOSE TYPE OF WOULD THAT WOULD THAT FALL UNDER DISCRIMINATORY EFFECT. I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT WE DO NOT WANT INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION TO BE PRACTICED. BUT I ALSO HEAR THE OPPOSITION AND. THEIR CONCERNS REGARDING THIS AND OF THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS BEING PLACED ON THOSE WHO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION SO ABSOLUTELY HERE THAT. THAT IS WHY WE ARE WORKING REALLY HARD WITH THE OPPOSITION TO FIGURE OUT THE LANGUAGE THAT WE CAN USE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE CAN. PUT INTO THIS BILL. SO THAT IT CAN MOVE FORWARD. BUT THAT IS A CONCERN AND I ABSOLUTELY RECOGNIZE THE THE PROOF. THE THE THE FACTORS OF PROOF THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH YEAH I KNOW W HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND YOU HAVE PERSONALLY MADE THE COMMITMENT TO ME. TO. WORK ON THIS. I ALSO SIT ON ENVIRONMENT SAFETY A COMMITTEE AND SO I WILL BE LOOKING. TO SEE YOUR PROGRESS THANK YOU IT'LL BE GREAT PROGRESS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE. MISTRESS WAS LIKE CLOSE. I UNDERSTAND MEMBERSIN CHAIR OF THAT AS THE BILL IS IN PRINT. IT IS A PERFECT. BUT I. DO GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THE OPPOSITION AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH. THE STATED HEART OF THIS LEGISLATION WILL NOT CREATING IN THE OWNERS LITIGATION RISK. WE DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THAT IS OUR PURPOSE. AND. AGAIN I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE. WITH THE OPPOSITION AND WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO GET TO THAT POINT. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND CHAIRS RECOMMENDATION IS AN AYE.

EGGMAN TRY EGGMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA KILEY MON. MCCARTY. MELENDEZ. MELENDEZ AYE STONE. STONE I. ZERO. BILL ITSELF. LAST BUT NOT LEAST ITEM NUMBER EIGHT AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHT MISTER BLOOM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THAT COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT CLARIFY. THE DEFINITION OF CLIMATE RESILIENCE AREAS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO MAKE CALIFORNIA HABITATS MORE CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN THE FACE RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF. ONGOING CLIMATE CHANGE. THE STATE'S CURRENT CLIMATE ADAPTION STRATEGY COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE SAFEGUARDING PLAN IS A TRIENNIAL REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. THE PLANTS PURPOSE IS TO IDENTIFY STATE AND REGIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITIES AND POTENTIAL STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THESE VULNERABILITIES. AUTHORED BY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GORDON AND TWENTY FIFTEEN THIS REPORT IS THE STATE'S A ROADMAP FOR EVERYTHING STATE AGENCIES ARE DOING AND WILL DO. PROTECT COMMUNITIES INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES IN THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT THE PLAN IS MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT RELATED TO HABITAT. THAT CONSERVATIVE CRITICAL PROTECTION OR AS WE LIKE TO CALL THEM SOURCE WATERS AND STRONGHOLDS TO ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO BE RESILIENT. IN THE FACE OF UNAVOIDABLE IMPACTS RECLINE. AND TO THAT END I'VE INTRODUCED AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHT TO BUILD OFF TO OFF OF OF MR GORDON'S WORK AND TO ADD TO THE EXISTING LANGUAGE. THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT AREAS MOST IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM RESILIENCE ARE ADEQUATELY ANALYZED AND CONSIDERED FOR LONG TERM IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THESE INCLUDE SPRING FED SOURCE WATERSHEDS SALMON AND STEEL HEAD STRONGHOLDS MOUNTAIN MEADOWS AND ESTUARIES. THIS BILL HIGHLIGHTS IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE FROM PRODUCTIVE ESTUARIES THAT'S A QUESTION. A QUESTOR CARBON TO HIGH SIERRA ALL CONDUCT VOLCANIC AQUIFER SYSTEMS THAT PRODUCE SICK THE PERCENT OF THE VOLUME OF SHASTA RESERVOIR. TO MOUNTAIN MEADOWS THAT STORE AND RELEASE WATER DURING THE RIGHT TIMES OF THE YEAR IN THE FACE. DWINDLING SNOWPACK AND WITHIN A HALF PET SAMUEL PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA TROUT. AND DR CARSON JEFFRIES WITH THE UC DAVIS CENTER FOR WATERSHED SCIENCES WHO OF THE BILL PICKED PROTECTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CARSON JEFFRIES AND I'M ABOUT DIRECTOR AND CO DIRECTOR FOR THE UC DAVIS AND OF WATERSHED SCIENCES. DO YOU SEE DAVIS HAS BEEN A LEADER IN WATER SCIENCE IN CALIFORNIA AND I PERSONALLY HAVE SPENT THE LAST TWELVE YEARS WORKING ON SPRING FED SYSTEMS IN THE NORTH STATE. SOURCE WATERS IN THE SHASTA REGION SUPPLY AN ESTIMATED FORTY PERCENT OF THE STATE'S HYDROELECTRIC POWER AND CONTRIBUTE OVER SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION GALLONS OF WATER NOT SHASTA WHICH ULTIMATELY IS USED FOR AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN WATER USE AS WELL AS ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. THE SPRING PHOTOGRAPHERS ON IMPORTANT SYSTEM OF THE WATER QUESTION FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. DURING THE DROWNED TWENTY FIFTEEN D. SYSTEM STILL MAINTAIN WATER THAT WAS ULTIMATELY PUT UNDER SHASTA AND USED FOR MANY PURPOSES. AS RESEARCH ON BIODIVERSITY AND HABITAT INVOLVED IT'S BECOME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT CERTAIN WATERSHEDS WILL NEED TO BE. OUR BEST CHANCE AND MAINTAINING RESILIENCE AS WE FACE UNAVOIDABLE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING CHANGING HYDROLOGICAL PATTERNS DROUGHT AND CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE. CALIFORNIA DOES NOT CURRENTLY PLAN TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT ITS MOST IMPORTANT WATERSHEDS FROM IMPACTS OF A CHANGING CLIMATE. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEM BETTER ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR VALUE TO PEOPLE AGRICULTURE WILDLIFE. AND PREPARE FOR TIMES AHEAD WHEN THEY MAY BE THE LAST CHANCE TO PROVIDE CONSISTENT CLEAN AND COLD WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AND I ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY THANK YOU. IF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS PATRICK SAMUEL A BAY AREA PROGRAM MANAGER CALIFORNIA TROUT. I'M HERE TODAY TO UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHT AND THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IN THESE AREAS THAT WILL BE BELIEVE WILL BE CALIFORNIA'S BEST CHANCE FOR ONGOING RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE EXISTING SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA PLANNED PUSHES THE CLIMATE ADAPTATION CONVERSATION IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ADDITIONS HIGHLY IMPORTANT PRIORITIES THAT DESERVE ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION. THE STATE'S CLIMATE ADAPTATION STRATEGY IDENTIFIES VULNERABILITIES THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN A CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY. AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHT WOULD ASK A NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THESE FOUR RESILIENCE AREAS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. ARE SENATE STILL HAD STRONGHOLDS OR SOURCE WATERSHEDS MOUNTAIN MEADOWS AND ESTUARIES. WELL SOME IMPORTANT CLIMATE IMPACTS MAY BE UNAVOIDABLE CALIFORNIA CAN WORK TOWARDS BUILDING A MORE EFFECTIVE STRATEGY SPECIFICALLY BY INCLUDING THESE KEY WATER ECOSYSTEMS OF THE STATE. BY MAINTAINING RESILIENCE AND MITIGATING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN CERTAIN AREAS. CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION AND ABUNDANT CLEAN WATER SOURCES THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS DEPEND UPON NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY EIGHT. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON PAUL MAY SO PACIFIC FOREST TRUST I'M THRILLED TO SEE MISTER BLOOM AGAIN WORKING ON A WATERSHED ON THE CLIMATE SORT OF BILL WE HAD THEM COULD PUT GOOD FORTUNATE IN A COUPLE YEARS AGO. AND I THINK IS IMPORTANT HERE IS RECOGNIZING THAT NOT EVERY ACRE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE EQUALLY RELEVANT TO MAINTAINING SOME OF THESE REALLY IMPORTANT VALUES LIKE CALLED CLEAN WATER. SALMON AND STEELHEAD IN IDENTIFYING THOSE AREAS THAT DO PLAY THAT DISPROPORTIONATE ROLE SLICK THOSE SPRING FED RIVERS UP IN THE NORTH NORTH STATE. TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT MAKING SURE WE PRIORITIZE THOSE SORTS OF CONSERVATION RESTORATION INVESTMENTS OF THE WE HAVE WATER TO RELY ON THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW. SO VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MELISSA AND MO ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA SUPPORT. YOU FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE. I'M SORRY. GOOD AFTERNOON NOEL CREAMERS THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION BUT I DID WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS SOME CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL AND. APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS TO TRY TO. FIGURE OUT THOSE WILL CONTINUE BUT. OUR CONCERN IS. UP WITH THE VERY SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS INCLUDED IN THE BILL THAT. MOVING FORWARD. THIS COULD CREATE ADDITIONAL SEQUEL REQUIREMENTS AND PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS FOR FOLKS WITHIN THOSE SOURCE WATERSHED SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THAT WOULD HAVE ON WATER AVAILABILITY TO FARMERS IN THAT AREA. WERE ALSO CONCERNED I'M GENERALLY ABOUT WATER AVAILABILITY STATEWIDE AND IF THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON THOSE SOURCE WATERSHEDS TO PROTECT THEM. WHERE WE GONNA GET OUR WATER I'M AS WE TALKED ABOUT THAT? SUPPLYING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WATER STATEWIDE SO I'M WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION IS TO ENSURE THAT. THE EFFORTS TO AND THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE MANAGE THESE AREAS DON'T THEN HAVE CONSEQUENCES ON ON. THOSE USING THOSE RESOURCES TODAY. THANK YOU ANY OF FOR THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.
