00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:39.605
MOST BASIC VIEW ISSUE FACING

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:40.206
CORRECTIONS IS THE NUMBER OF

00:10:40.272 --> 00:10:41.807
PEOPLE WHO ARE AT IN ITS

00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:47.780

TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE.

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:54.086
THAT WE BROUGHT A CASE MANY

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.955
YEARS AGO THAT WENT TO THE

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:57.757
SUPREME COURT THAT CAP PRISON

00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:00.259
POPULATION AT A HUNDRED THIRTY

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.694
SEVEN POINT 5% OF ITS DESIGN

00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:04.030
PASSIVITY AN- APARTMENT HAS

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:08.100
THROUGH. INITIATIVES IN SOME

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.568
LEGISLATION BEEN ABLE TO MEET

00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:11.637

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:13.739
CLEAR. TO PANEL AND YOU WILL

00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:15.941
MANY OF WHOM. PROBABLY KNOW

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:17.943
THIS BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.612
PRISONS WHO WERE WITH WHICH

00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:20.179
YOU'RE WAY OVER THAT DESIGN

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:23.783
CAPACITY. THERE ARE TEN PERSONS

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:25.584
WHICH YOU'RE OVER THE COURT

00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:27.820
ORDERED CAP NOT. THE CAP WAS

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:29.488
DESIGNED FOR THE SYSTEM AS A

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:31.957
WHOLE SO THAT I DON'T WANT TO

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:32.491
MAKE IT CLEAR THEY'RE NOT

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:33.726
VIOLATING A COURT ORDER. JUST

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:35.494
TO GIVE YOU SOME PERSPECTIVE.

00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:36.062

00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:37.596

PRISONS ARE OVER A HUNDRED

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:43.636
SIXTY PERCENT. AND THE HIGHEST

00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:45.905
PRISON IS AT A HUNDRED AND 73%

00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:47.573
OF DESIGN CAPACITY THAT'S THE-

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.677
PRISON AT SOLANO. IN MY OPINION

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:53.913
UNTIL THE STATE AND THE

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:57.616
DEPARTMENT GETS A HANDLE ON ON

00:11:57.683 --> 00:11:59.485
REDUCING THE- UP PRISON

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:03.489
POPULATION. MANY OF THE EFFORTS

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:04.123
THAT KATHY WANTS TO SUCCEED AND

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:13.532
WE HAVE TO LITIGATE. YEAH.

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:15.568
TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS WHAT

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:17.803
WON'T GET FIXED THERE ARE

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.772
SIMPLY TOO MANY PEOPLE CONFINED

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:22.141
IN SMALL SPACES AND THE

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:23.676
DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:26.045
PROVIDE THE SERVICES NECESSARY

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:29.582
TO NOT ONLY KEEP THEM SAFE

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:31.584
PREVENT THEM FROM GETTING SICK

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:35.621
OR DYING BUT ALSO YOU IT'S

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:37.490
REALLY HARD TO REHABILITATE

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:39.592
SOMEBODY IN AN INSTITUTION

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:41.660
WHICH IS NOT SAFE AND WHICH IS

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:43.829
NOT PROVIDING THE PROCREATE

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:47.633
SERVICES AND YOU IT'S REALLY

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.234
HARD TO REHABILITATE SOMEBODY

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:55.774
IN SUCH MASSIVE PRISON. IS

00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:56.342
THERE AN I. T. PERSON IN THE

00:12:56.408 --> 00:12:59.879
HOUSE OKAY VERY GO. SO OVER IT

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:01.614
I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT THAT'S-

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.816
YOU KNOW MY IF THERE IS GOING

00:13:03.883 --> 00:13:05.818
TO BE IN AN EFFORT TO REFORM

00:13:05.885 --> 00:13:09.622
THE PRISON SYSTEM MY ENERGIES

00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:10.189
WOULD BE ON REDUCING THE

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:11.924
POPULATION BECAUSE THAT THAT

00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:13.826
INHIBITS EVERYTHING FROM THAT

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:15.861
KATHY WAS TRYING TO DO FROM.

00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:19.598
FROM BECOMING A REALITY AND I

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:21.667
WANT TO TALK TO AN- A LITTLE

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:23.769
BIT ABOUT. OUR CASE THAT

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:27.606
INVOLVED THE FAILURE OF THE

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:28.240
DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE MENTALLY

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:29.842
ILL SERVICES AND HOW THAT INTO

00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:33.746
RELATES WITH THE PRISON CAP THE

00:13:33.812 --> 00:13:35.748
SERVER SIDE RATE AS YOU MIGHT

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:37.583
HAVE READ IN THE SAN FRANCISCO

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.752
CHRONICLE ARTICLE JUST A COUPLE

00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:41.520
WEEKS AGO. IS THAT A

00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:43.589
HISTORICALLY HIGH RATES RALPH

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:46.025
THE AS THE SECRETARY OF THE

00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:47.660
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:49.962
MENTIONED THAT IT'S A SUICIDE

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:53.899
CRISIS IT'S A TWENTY SIX POINT

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:55.668
THREE PEOPLE COMMIT SUICIDE OUT

00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:57.603
OF EVERY HUNDRED AND THOUSANDS.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.170
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PRISON

00:13:58.237 --> 00:14:01.640
THAT'S ABOUT THE HIGHEST AMONG

00:14:01.707 --> 00:14:03.609
MANY PRISON POPULOUS PRESENTS

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.844
LARGE PRISON SYSTEMS IN THE

00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:11.684
COUNTRY. AND IT'S HAPPENING

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.886
DESPITE THE OVER TWENTY YEARS

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:17.823
OF LITIGATION. OVER EFFORTS TO

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.592
IMPROVE A SUICIDE QUESTIONS AND

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:21.860
JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE

00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:22.428
MENTALLY ILL POPULATION THE

00:14:22.494 --> 00:14:27.800
POPULATION. SINCE WE REDUCE THE

00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:29.668
POPULATION FROM A HIGH OF A

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:31.704
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.806
THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH MENTAL

00:14:33.872 --> 00:14:35.774
ILLNESS BUT NOT WITHOUT HUNDRED

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:37.509
SEVENTY THOUSAND. PEOPLE IN

00:14:37.576 --> 00:14:39.645
PRISON WHEN WE FILED THE

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.747
OVERCROWDING CASE TO WHAT IT IS

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:43.916
NOW THERE ARE THREE THOUSAND

00:14:43.983 --> 00:14:45.684
SIX HUNDRED MORE MENTALLY ILL

00:14:45.751 --> 00:14:46.352
PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM THAN THERE

00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:49.655
WERE WHEN WE STARTED THAT CASE.

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.890
AND A MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF

00:14:51.957 --> 00:14:53.726
PEOPLE IN PRISON AS- A AS A

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:57.596
MATTER OF FACT YOU KNOW AS OF

00:14:57.663 --> 00:15:01.500
AUGUST OF THIS YEAR THERE WERE

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.769
TWENTY EIGHT OR 29% OF THE

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.671
PRISON POPULATION HAD A MEN

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.506
ONLY MENTAL ILLNESS DIAGNOSIS.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:10.175
SO WE ARE REALLY TURNING THAT

00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:12.144
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS INTO

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:13.979
TWO INTO A PLACE WHICH HOUSES

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:16.181
PEOPLE WITH LIFE SENTENCES AND

00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:21.520
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. AND

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.722
AS A RESULT PEOPLE ARE GETTING

00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:24.223
TREATMENT THE STATE OF

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.693
CALIFORNIA DESPITE ITS- EFFORTS

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.895
WHICH I DON'T THINK HAVE BEEN

00:15:29.962 --> 00:15:31.630
AS ALICE'S THEY COULD BE. FIND

00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:35.701
ENOUGH. PHYSICIAN OR

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.736
PSYCHIATRISTS TO TREAT THE

00:15:37.803 --> 00:15:38.404
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THEY HAVE AN

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.172
MENTAL ILLNESS SO IF YOU'RE

00:15:40.239 --> 00:15:42.007
LOOKING FOR SYSTEMIC REFORMS I

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:43.976
THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

00:15:44.043 --> 00:15:47.513
RATE AT WHICH WE INCARCERATE

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:48.080
PEOPLE WITH MENTALLY ILL AND

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:49.715
PROVIDE COMMUNITY GRAMS WHICH

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.750
ARE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AND

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:53.719
MUCH CHEAPER THAN SENDING. A

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:54.353
PEOPLE WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS TO

00:15:54.420 --> 00:16:05.664
PRISON. THE OTHER. SYSTEM WIDE.

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:06.165
PROBLEM THAT'S FACING

00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:07.700
CORRECTIONS IS THE

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:09.968
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EXISTS IN

00:16:10.035 --> 00:16:11.970
THE PRISONS IT WOULD IT'S NOT

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:14.139
AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT THE

00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:15.941
PUT SOME OF THE PRISONS ARE

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:19.511
LITERALLY FALLING APART THERE

00:16:19.578 --> 00:16:21.680
ARE HOLES IN THE ROOFS OF WINGS

00:16:21.747 --> 00:16:25.718
OF PRISONS HOUSING UNITS OF

00:16:25.784 --> 00:16:27.519
PRISONS HAVE TO BE REPLACED

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:30.289
CAPTIONS HAVE TO BE REPLACED IF

00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:30.823
YOU GO TO THE CALIFORNIA

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:33.692
INSTITUTION FOR MEN YOU'LL SEE

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:35.828
A THIRD WORLD PLUMBING SYSTEM.

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:39.698
AND WELL HAS BEEN AN

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:41.633
ACCELERATED BECAUSE IT'S BEEN

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.836
OVER CROWDED SO WHAT IS WHAT

00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:45.838
WAS DESIGNED FOR A CERTAIN

00:16:45.904 --> 00:16:47.973
NUMBER OF PEOPLE IT'S BEEN IT'S

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.875
LIKE IF YOU LIVED IN YOUR HOUSE

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:53.545
AND YOU'RE INVITED TEN PEOPLE

00:16:53.612 --> 00:16:54.146
TO SHARE A FOR. A FOUR PERSON

00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:57.950
HOUSE. ALL THE SYSTEMS THAT

00:16:58.016 --> 00:16:59.518
THAT HOUSE HAS TO OPERATE WOULD

00:16:59.585 --> 00:17:00.152
DETERIORATE FASTER AND THAT'S

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:00.719
WHAT'S HAPPENED BECAUSE OF

00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:01.820
OVERCROWDING. SO TO GIVE YOU A

00:17:01.887 --> 00:17:05.824
SENSE OF HOW. EXPENSIVE THIS IS

00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:10.028
AND HOW. THE BASE OF IT IS THE

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:11.930
DEPARTMENT TO ITS AND THE

00:17:11.997 --> 00:17:13.866
LEGISLATURE TO ITS CREDIT IT

00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:16.201
INITIATED THE STUDY BY THE SAME

00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:18.036
PEOPLE WHO WHO BUILT MANY OF

00:17:18.103 --> 00:17:19.872
THE PRISONS TO DETERMINE WHAT

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:21.940
NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED IN THE

00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:25.711
PRISON SYSTEM. AND THEY LOOKED

00:17:25.778 --> 00:17:26.211
AT THE CALIFORNIA MEN'S

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:29.648
FACILITY IT BACK TO BILL AND

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:33.685
THEY FOUND THAT. IT WILL COST

00:17:33.752 --> 00:17:34.286
SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:35.988
MILLION DOLLARS JUST TO BRING

00:17:36.054 --> 00:17:39.958
THAT UP. PRISON UP TO STANDARDS

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:41.960
AND THAT WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED

00:17:42.027 --> 00:17:43.729
FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:47.533
REPLACE A SEVERAL HOUSING UNITS

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:49.668
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR MILLION

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:50.235
DOLLARS PER LAYS A BUNCH OF

00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:51.804
OTHER HOUSING UNITS. HUNDRED

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.106
AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:55.941
TO REPLACE A BUNCH OF OTHER

00:17:56.008 --> 00:17:57.609
HOUSING UNITS AND THAT'S NOT

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:58.110
COUNTING THE KITCHEN AND

00:17:58.177 --> 00:18:01.580
ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS SO THAT'S

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.715
ONE ISSUE THAT IS HOVERING OVER

00:18:03.782 --> 00:18:07.619
THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT THERE

00:18:07.686 --> 00:18:09.755
THESE FACILITIES ESSENTIALLY

00:18:09.822 --> 00:18:11.790
ARE NOT SAFE AND- TO BRING

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:15.694
THAT. POINT HOME. WE LITIGATED

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:17.529
A CASE AT THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:19.531
TREATMENT FACILITY IN CORCORAN

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:21.600
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THAT OF.

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:25.571
YEAH CAT THESE ALMA MATER. AND

00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:27.673
THE REASON WE LITIGATED THE

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:28.307
CASES BECAUSE A PRISONER WROTE

00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:29.908
TO US AND SAID EATING IN THE

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:31.810
DINING HALL WHERE THERE'S A

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:33.712
HOLE IN THE ROOF AND AS YOU

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.781
KNOW IN CALIFORNIA IT RAINS.

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:41.553
AND SO THE RAIN WOULD COME AND

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:42.087
BECAUSE WELL THE ROOF IS

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:43.822
FAILING AND THE RAIN WOULD WELL

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:47.726
I READ YOU WHAT THE COURT SAID

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:49.928
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT. TWO

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:53.765
PRISONERS WHO ARE EATING AT IN

00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:55.534
THAT DINING HALL. IT'S A SHAME

00:18:55.601 --> 00:18:57.703
THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:59.505
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:01.440
CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:03.709
HAVE A LOT OF THE FIST THE

00:19:03.775 --> 00:19:04.309
EIGHT DOT ALL. ALL IN SUCH A

00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:05.611
STATE OF DISREPAIR. THE

00:19:05.677 --> 00:19:07.546
EVIDENCE PAINTS A PICTURE OF A

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:08.146
CORRECTIONAL DINING BILL THE

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:11.583
LONG NEGLECTED OF BASIC HOUSING

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:15.554
MAINTENANCE THAT IS NOW

00:19:15.621 --> 00:19:23.495
IRRECONCILABLE WITH LOOKING XIN.

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:24.029
IN THE NATION AND OF SUCH

00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:31.670
FINANCIAL UPON. THE BILL HAS.

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:32.237
THE EXPERT WE HIRED IN THAT

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:34.072
CASE EXAMINE THE ROOF HE'S HE'S

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:35.941
EXAMINED THE THOUSAND ROOFS AND

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:36.542
FOUND THAT WAS THE WORST HE'S

00:19:36.608 --> 00:19:37.976
EVER SEEN HE TESTIFIED THAT THE

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:39.711
ROOFING FAILURES CREATE QUOTE A

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:41.713
PATHWAY OF RAIN WATER MAKES

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.682
PC'S THAT FLOWS DOWNWARD IN THE

00:19:43.749 --> 00:19:45.751
ARCHITECTURAL SYSTEMS AND INTO

00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:49.688
THE DINING ROOM. BELOW. HE ALL

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:53.592
AND THE COURT FOUND THAT

00:19:53.659 --> 00:19:55.727
CEILING TILES SATURATED WITH

00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:56.328
THIS WATER POSE A SUBSTANTIAL

00:19:56.395 --> 00:19:59.731
RISK OF FALLING ON INMATES.

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:01.600
CAUSING THEM EITHER PHYSICAL

00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:02.167
INJURY FROM THE IMPACT OF

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:03.969
PLACING THEM IN DIRECT CONTACT

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:07.739
WITH FECAL MATTER AND MOLD ON A

00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:09.675
SEPARATE OCCASION AMOUNTS FELL

00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:12.077
INTO THE DINING ROOM TABLE FROM

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:15.647
THE CEILING. AND EVEN WHEN IT'S

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:17.549
NOT RAINING THE EVIDENCE

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:18.150
ESTABLISHES THAT INMATES ARE

00:20:18.216 --> 00:20:20.018
SEATED AT TABLES UNDER EXPOSED

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:21.820
CEILING FROM WHICH MICE AND

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:25.490
MAGGOTS FALL DURING MEAL TIME.

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:27.826
AND THE TOP ALL THAT OFF THIS

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:29.761
IS A CASE THAT WENT TO

00:20:29.828 --> 00:20:31.930
LITIGATION THE DEPARTMENT KNEW

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:35.734
ABOUT IT WE REYES. IT WAS A

00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:37.603
WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS THE

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:39.471

FILE THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL

00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:43.942
TO GET THIS PROBLEM RESOLVED.

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:45.477
THEY GRANTED HIS APPEAL BUT THE

00:20:45.544 --> 00:20:47.913
PROBLEM AND WE HAVE A LITIGATE

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.982
THIS AND IT TOOK ACTUALLY EVEN

00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:53.752
AFTER WE WON. THE CASE IN THE

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:55.954
COURT IT TOOK THE PERSONAL

00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:59.658
INTERVENTION OF SECRETARY DS

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:00.258
THAT WE CLOSE THE DINING HALL

00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:03.695
UNTIL THE. PROBLEM WAS

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:06.298
CORRECTED SO. IN CONCLUSION.

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:06.698
POPULATION ISSUES

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:07.299
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES AND THE

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:09.701
NUMBER OF MENTALLY ILL WHO WERE

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:10.302
IN THE PRISON SYSTEM ARE THE

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:13.839
ISSUES THAT I HOPE. YOU ALL AND

00:21:55.947 --> 00:22:01.753
THE STATE COULD TAKE TO REDUCE

POPULATION CAP. MORE

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:05.984
SPECIFICALLY CDC ARE IS

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:07.953
REQUIRED TO LIMIT PRISON

00:23:08.019 --> 00:23:09.988
OVERCROWDING BY KEEPING THE

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:11.823
POPULATION OF ITS THIRTY FOUR

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.494
STATE OWN PRISONS TO UNDER

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.061
ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:18.029
INMATES. AND TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:23:18.096 --> 00:23:19.664
STATE DOESN'T EXCEED THAT CAP

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:23.502
CDC ARE MAINTAINS A POPULATION

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:25.670
TYPICALLY OF A COUPLE THOUSAND

00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:27.739
INMATES LESS THAN A HUNDRED

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:29.474

INCREASES IN THE POPULATION AND

00:23:35.614 --> 00:23:36.148
AVOID TO AVOID EXCEEDING THAT

00:23:36.214 --> 00:23:39.851
THE COURT ORDER. AND I WOULD

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:41.686
ALSO NOTE THAT INMATES THAT THE

STATE OWNED AND OPERATED

00:23:44.456 --> 00:23:45.891
PRISONS TO AVOID EXCEEDING THE

00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:47.692
CAP BECAUSE THE OVERALL

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:49.594
POPULATION IS HIGHER THAN THAT

00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:51.663
CURRENTLY HIGHER THAN A HUNDRED

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.565
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND. SO AND AS

00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:55.734
OF OCTOBER NINTH CDC OUR HOUSE

00:23:55.801 --> 00:23:57.869
ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED MALE

00:23:57.936 --> 00:23:58.503
INMATES AND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY

00:23:58.570 --> 00:23:59.838
FEMALE INMATES AND PRIVATE

00:23:59.905 --> 00:24:01.840
PRIVATELY OPERATED CONTRACT

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:05.644
FACILITIES. AND ABOUT SEVENTEEN

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.144
HUNDRED MALE INMATES IN

00:24:06.211 --> 00:24:07.546
PUBLICLY OPERATED CONTRACT

00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:09.681
FACILITIES AND ABOUT SIXTY

00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:10.215
SEVEN HUNDRED INMATES IN

00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:11.783
VARIOUS OTHER PLACEMENT.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:15.520
INCLUDING CONSERVATION CAMPS.

00:24:15.587 --> 00:24:17.789
MOVING ON TO PAGE THREE. I'M

00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:18.256
GOING TO DISCUSS SOME

00:24:18.323 --> 00:24:21.493
APPROACHES FOR ACCOMMODATING

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.060
THE PROJECTED DECLINE IN THE

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:25.664
INMATE POPULATION. EXISTING

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.599
STATE LAW REQUIRES CDC OUR

00:24:27.666 --> 00:24:29.568
FIRST TO REMOVE ALL IN ME ALL

00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:30.135
MALE INMATES FROM PRIVATELY

00:24:30.202 --> 00:24:33.505
OPERATED CONTRACT PRISONS WHICH

00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:35.574
IS IN PROCESS THE STATE DID

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.742
REMOVE INMATES FROM ONE OF

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:39.644
THREE OF THOSE FACILITIES LAST

00:24:39.711 --> 00:24:40.245
MONTH AS AS A POPULATION. HAS

00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:43.782
BEEN DECLINING. STATE LAW THEN

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:45.717
ARTHRITIS CDC ARE TO DETERMINE

00:24:45.784 --> 00:24:47.619
HOW TO ACCOMMODATE FURTHER

00:24:47.686 --> 00:24:49.487
DECLINES IN THE POPULATION BUT

00:24:49.554 --> 00:24:50.055
REQUIRES CDC ARE TO CONSIDER

00:24:50.121 --> 00:24:53.625
CERTAIN CRITERIA SUCH AS COST

00:24:53.692 --> 00:24:54.159
AS WELL AS GENDER SPECIFIC

00:24:54.226 --> 00:24:57.762
HOUSING NEEDS. AND REGARDING

00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:59.798
BOYS ABOUT HOW TO REDUCE

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:01.800
CAPACITY IN LINE WITH THE

00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:04.035
PROJECTED DECLINES OF IN THE

00:25:04.102 --> 00:25:05.670
PRISON POPULATION. WE THINK

00:25:05.737 --> 00:25:07.873
THAT CLOSING STATE OPERATED

00:25:07.939 --> 00:25:08.473
PRISONS WOULD LIKELY ALLOW FOR

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.676
THE GREATEST SAVINGS. ALTHOUGH

00:25:11.743 --> 00:25:12.210
THERE ARE OF COURSE OTHER

00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:13.879
CRITERIA THAT SHOULD SHOULD BE

00:25:13.945 --> 00:25:17.616
CONSIDERED AND SO ON THAT POINT

00:25:17.682 --> 00:25:19.818
AND AFTER. THE STATE REMOVES

00:25:19.885 --> 00:25:22.020
THE ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED

00:25:22.087 --> 00:25:23.722
INMATES FROM THE MAIL PRIVATE

00:25:23.788 --> 00:25:25.857
PRIVATELY OPERATED CONTACT AS

00:25:25.924 --> 00:25:26.491
HOUSING MALES AS IS REQUIRED BY

00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:29.928
STATE LAW. AND THE PROJECTIONS

00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:31.630
SUGGEST THAT THERE WILL BE A

00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:33.732
REMAINING REDUCTION OF ABOUT

00:25:33.798 --> 00:25:34.332
FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED INMATES BY

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:35.934
JUNE TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:36.401
WILL STILL NEED TO BE

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:37.769
ACCOMMODATED. AND SO THERE'S

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:39.971
VARIOUS WAYS THAT THIS COULD BE

00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:40.538
IT THIS REDUCTION COULD BE

00:25:40.605 --> 00:25:43.608
ACCOMMODATED. AND THE THREE

00:25:43.675 --> 00:25:45.510
THREE WAYS THREE MAIN WAYS AND

00:25:45.577 --> 00:25:46.044
ARE WHAT I'M GOING TO BE

00:25:46.111 --> 00:25:47.812
DISCUSSING HERE TODAY THE FIRST

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:49.915
IS TO CLOSE THEY OPERATED

00:25:49.981 --> 00:25:53.518
PRISONS AND WITH THAT A ROUGHLY

00:25:53.585 --> 00:25:54.085
FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED AND MEET

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:55.520
DECLINE THE STATE COULD CLOSE

00:25:55.587 --> 00:25:57.522
BOTH THE SMALL AND MEDIUM

00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:59.824
SIZED. PRESENT AT AND WHICH WE

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:03.628
ESTIMATE WOULD YIELD ROUGHLY A

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:05.563
FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.933
ANNUAL SAVINGS. I'M AN ADDITION

00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:09.901
WHEN A PRISON IS BOTH THE

00:26:09.968 --> 00:26:10.502
PENDING ON THE PRESIDENT THEY

00:26:10.568 --> 00:26:13.505
COULD ALSO. TO AVOID COSTLY

00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:15.507
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS

00:26:15.573 --> 00:26:18.043
THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE

00:26:18.109 --> 00:26:18.610
NECESSARY TO CONTINUE OP THE

00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:22.047
PRESENT. THE SECOND APPROACH

00:26:22.113 --> 00:26:23.815
WOULD BE TO PUT A PRIORITIZE

00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:24.449
ELIMINATING THE REMAIN CONTRACT

00:26:24.516 --> 00:26:25.884
BEDS. AND SO AS I MENTIONED

00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:27.953
AFTER THE FOURTEEN HUNDRED

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:29.754
HOUSING MALES AND PRIVATELY

00:26:29.821 --> 00:26:31.523
OPERATED FACILITIES ARE REMOVED

00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:33.658
THERE'S WOULD STILL BE OUT TO

00:26:33.725 --> 00:26:35.560
HUNT TWO THOUSAND INMATES LEFT

00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:37.696
IN CONTRACT FACILITIES. AND SO

00:26:37.762 --> 00:26:39.698
IF THE STATE CHOSE TO REMOVE

00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:41.800
INMATES FROM THOSE FACILITIES.

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:44.002
IT WHAT WE ESTIMATE THAT GIVEN

00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:45.804
THE SIZE OF THE POPULATION

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.872
DECLINE IT COULD STILL CLOSE

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:51.476
AND MEDIUM SIZED PRISON. IN

00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:52.010
DOING SO DOING THESE TWO

00:26:52.077 --> 00:26:53.778
ACTIONS TOGETHER WE ESTIMATE

00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:55.914
WOULD SAVE AROUND A COUPLE

00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:56.414
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:57.983
ANNUALLY. AND FINALLY THE THIRD

00:26:58.049 --> 00:27:00.085
APPROACH THAT I WILL MENTION

00:27:00.151 --> 00:27:01.886
HERE TODAY WOULD BE SIMPLY TO

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:03.655
ALLOW THE POPULATION OF TO

00:27:03.722 --> 00:27:05.790
MAINTAIN CONTRACTS MEAN TEEN

00:27:05.857 --> 00:27:07.759
OPERATION OF ALL THE PRISONS

00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:09.794
BUT JUST ALLOW THE POPULATION

00:27:09.861 --> 00:27:11.830
OF THE- F. THIRTY FOUR STATE

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:12.497
OWNED AND OPERATED PRISONS. TO

00:27:12.564 --> 00:27:13.898
DECLINE AS THE INMATE

00:27:13.965 --> 00:27:15.533
POPULATION DECLINES IN OTHER

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.669
WORDS OPERATING PRISONS LESS

00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:19.671
DENSELY AND WE ESTIMATE THAT

00:27:19.738 --> 00:27:21.606
THAT APPROACH WOULD YIELD TOTAL

00:27:21.673 --> 00:27:23.742
OPERATIONAL SAVINGS ON IN THE

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:24.309
SEVERAL TENS OF MILLIONS OF

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:27.779
DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND I WILL

00:27:27.846 --> 00:27:29.714
RETURN TO THE HAND OUT FOR

00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:30.348
PANEL. OVER TO HOLD MY COMMENTS

00:27:30.415 --> 00:27:30.915
THERE AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

00:27:30.982 --> 00:27:45.563
QUESTIONS

00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:57.542
. OKAY CAN YOU HEAR ME

00:27:57.609 --> 00:28:01.780
ALL RIGHT SO I USED TO BE

00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:02.380
DIRECTOR WILL STAY SO DEFERRED

00:28:02.447 --> 00:28:05.583
MAINTENANCE IS. CUT ABOVE MY

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.585
THING AND I KNOW AND PUBLIC

00:28:07.652 --> 00:28:09.521
SECTOR WE DON'T DO DEFERRED

00:28:09.587 --> 00:28:11.523
MAINTENANCE OVERALL NOT JUST

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:12.123
CDC ARE AND YOU'RE MENTIONING

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:16.594
SOME. RENT IS THINGS ARE GOING

00:28:16.661 --> 00:28:19.631
ON AND I IN A WAY TO ONE. OTHER

00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:21.766
FACILITIES WHERE THEY HAVE NO

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:25.537
AIR CONDITIONING AND IT CAN GET

00:28:25.603 --> 00:28:27.605
UPWARDS TO A HUNDRED AND

00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:29.541
FIFTEEN DEGREES OUTSIDE AND

00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:30.141
PART OF IT YOU RAISED A LOT OF

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:33.645
THE INFORMATION FROM THE TRACK.

00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:34.245
QUAL DURING THE DAY AND THEN

00:28:34.312 --> 00:28:35.814
THEY GO TO SLEEP. AT NIGHT SO

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.651
THAT THEY CAN CRAWL BUT IT'S A

00:28:39.717 --> 00:28:40.185
AND HAVE SWAMPED BANDS AND

00:28:40.251 --> 00:28:41.820
THINGS THAT NATURE BUT NO ONE'S

00:28:41.886 --> 00:28:43.521
EVER REALLY ADDRESSING MAYBE

00:28:43.588 --> 00:28:45.590
JUST GET SOME AIR CONDITIONING.

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:49.694
BUT IT'S ALSO VERY COST

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:55.800
PROHIBITIVE. SO. YOUR YOUR NAME

00:28:55.867 --> 00:28:57.769
AND ALL THAT ARE YOU KIND OF

00:28:57.836 --> 00:28:58.403
SAME WE SHOULD GO AND MAYBE GO

00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:59.938
TO PUBLIC AND GET A BOND AND

00:29:00.004 --> 00:29:03.775
TRY TO REBUILD A READ AND OFF

00:29:03.842 --> 00:29:04.342
THE FINANCES OVER SQUIRMING

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.010
RIGHT NOW BUT EACH WEEK SO WE

00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:09.714
THINK ABOUT A COUPLE OF BONDING

00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:11.749
PROGRAM TO. REHABILITATE OUR

00:29:11.816 --> 00:29:15.687
BUILDING SO THAT THEY FIT IN

00:29:15.753 --> 00:29:16.087
LINE WITH THE NEW

00:29:16.154 --> 00:29:19.757
REHABILITATION PROGRAMS THAT

00:29:19.824 --> 00:29:23.595
WERE DESIGNING. SO THAT NOT BE.

00:29:23.661 --> 00:29:24.229
REFERS TO BUILD AND BRING THEM

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:25.230
UP TO STANDARD BUT WE DESIGNED

00:29:25.296 --> 00:29:29.634
A MAST SIDE SO THAT THEY- KIND

00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:30.235
OF THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR ANY

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:31.703
OTHER THINGS THAT WE WANT TO DO.

00:29:31.769 --> 00:29:32.303
YEAH I DON'T REALLY CARE WHERE

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:35.840
YOU GET THE MONEY. I'M NOT A

00:29:35.907 --> 00:29:41.779
MONEY ISSUE YEAH I KNOW I KNOW

00:29:41.846 --> 00:29:43.681
BUT YEAH IT'S- IS NOT ONLY

00:29:43.748 --> 00:29:45.650
UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE THEY

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:46.317
DON'T HAVE AIR CONDITIONING BUT

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:49.554
IT'S ALSO DANGEROUS IT MAKES

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.589
PEOPLE SICK AND IT'S A MATTER

00:29:51.656 --> 00:29:55.894
OF ACTUAL. YOU KNOW. WILL SAVE

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.597
A AND FREE FROM DISEASE. AND SO

00:29:59.664 --> 00:30:01.833
YES I THINK YOU KNOW YOU'RE

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.968
LOOKING AT SEVEN HUNDRED AND

00:30:04.035 --> 00:30:04.602
SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR

00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:07.772
JUST ONE PRISON. HONEY BUT IT'S

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:09.874
REAL MONEY AND IT'S GOING TO

00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:11.876
COST A LOT OF AND THEY WILL LET

00:30:11.943 --> 00:30:14.012
MORE THAT THEY'VE STUDIED AND

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:15.680
WE'RE WAITING FOR THOSE REPORTS

00:30:15.747 --> 00:30:17.916
TO COME OUT AND I GUESS IS THE

00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:19.751
RELATIVELY SIMILAR. AND SO

00:30:19.817 --> 00:30:21.753
YOU'RE LOOKING AT I DON'T MY

00:30:21.819 --> 00:30:23.688
MATHIS BET THAT'S WHICH IS WHY

00:30:23.755 --> 00:30:24.289
I'M NOT MONEY GUY BUT YOU'RE

00:30:24.355 --> 00:30:25.890
LOOKING A LOT OF MONEY IN ORDER

00:30:25.957 --> 00:30:29.761
TO DO THIS SO. MY SUGGESTION

00:30:29.827 --> 00:30:33.531
WOULD BE TO PRIORITIZE THE

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:37.569
THING THAT I DID. THE REAL

00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:38.203
ESTATE AND THE PROPERTIES WHICH

00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:41.839
ARE AT THEM BECAUSE THE MOST

00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:45.610
HARTMAN THERE ARE. PUT IT YES

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:51.449
BOTH END UP YOUR INCARCERATED

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:51.983
TO FIX THOSE IN THAT SOME

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.751
SOMEWHAT OF ON SOMEWHAT OF A

00:30:53.818 --> 00:30:54.319
QUICK SCHEDULE BECAUSE RIGHT

00:30:54.385 --> 00:30:55.720
NOW THERE'S NO PLAN AT ALL.

00:30:55.787 --> 00:31:11.603
THANK YOU

00:31:17.575 --> 00:31:18.943

00:31:21.946 --> 00:31:23.781
THREE PANELISTS I THINK THE

00:31:23.848 --> 00:31:29.487
UNDERSECRETARY. DESCRIBED A-

00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:30.054
SOME OF THE REHABILITATION

00:31:30.121 --> 00:31:31.990
OPTIONS I THINK WE ALL KNOW

00:31:32.056 --> 00:31:35.560
THAT IN ORDER TO REALLY ENSURE

00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:36.194
THE POPULATION GOES DOWN BE

00:31:36.261 --> 00:31:37.996
ABILITY ASIANS GRANT TO BE DONE

00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:41.466
BETTER PROBABLY MORE

00:31:41.532 --> 00:31:43.735
STRATEGICALLY AND WITH CLEAR

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:45.837
RESULTS SUGGEST FOR REQUESTED

00:31:45.903 --> 00:31:49.674
UNDERSECRETARY BUT LOVE THE

WHICH IS BETTER IS. I'M NOT

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:55.913
NOTHING YOU HAVE. THE CLASSES

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.982
IN PLACE IN THE FUTURE I KNOW

00:31:58.049 --> 00:31:58.583
THE SNAPPING DONE YET IN THE

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.619
FUTURE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

00:33:07.785 --> 00:33:11.622
OUTCOMES. IN IN SOME WAYS TO

00:33:11.689 --> 00:33:15.793
SEE. OUR OFFENDERS ABLE TO GET

I'M NOT THE PROJECT FOR. WHO'S

00:33:43.554 --> 00:33:44.122
JUST SO WE KNOW WE KNOW WHO'S

00:33:44.188 --> 00:33:46.090
IN. CHARGE OF DEVELOPING THAT

00:33:46.157 --> 00:33:49.660
TRACKING IN THAT MEASUREMENT.

00:33:49.727 --> 00:33:52.130
SO IT VARIES PEOPLE HAVE

00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:53.698
DIFFERENT PIECES SO WORKFORCE

00:33:53.765 --> 00:33:55.466

TO IMPLEMENT HAVE THEIR PEACE

00:33:57.835 --> 00:34:03.674
FOR VERY SPECIFIC TRADES. FOR

00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:05.576
LIKE THE WHAT A WELDING TRADER

00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:06.244
CARPENTER TRAITS OF THOSE TYPE

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.045
OF THINGS I KNOW DEAR PEAS

00:34:08.112 --> 00:34:09.714

MISTRESSES AGAIN SPEAK TO THAT

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:13.985
AND THEN OF COURSE OUR OFFICE

00:34:14.051 --> 00:34:15.920
OF RESEARCH IS PARTNERING UP TO

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:17.655
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY.

00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:21.893
GOING FORWARD. WHAT THE WHAT

00:34:21.959 --> 00:34:23.961

SO. IT'S. I WOULD THINK TO

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:37.642
FIGURE OUT WHAT PROGRAMS ARE

00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:38.209
BASS TO GIVE US THE BIGGEST

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:41.679
BANG FOR OUR BUCK MEANING AND

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:43.815
ALL USE ONE OF OUR PROGRAMS FOR

00:34:43.881 --> 00:34:46.050
EXAMPLE ARE UNDERWATER WELDING

00:34:46.117 --> 00:34:49.487
THIS GUY'S OF THE CORD TO PA

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:50.021
HAS RECIDIVISM. OUR CODING

00:34:50.087 --> 00:34:53.825
PROGRAM. LOW IF ANY WERE

00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:55.626
SERVICE AT RIGHT RATE SO THE

00:34:55.693 --> 00:34:56.260
BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK FOR

00:34:56.327 --> 00:34:59.764
THOSE TYPE OF PROGRAMS. TO FOUR

SUCCESSFUL. YEAH. UHHUH. YEAH

00:35:13.811 --> 00:35:25.756
SURE. UHHUH OUR. THAT'S FAIR I

00:35:25.823 --> 00:35:27.692
MEAN INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITS.

00:35:27.758 --> 00:35:28.159
THIS IS OUR NUMBER ONE

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:29.694
CHALLENGE IN OUR DEPARTMENT.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.762
PHYSICAL PLANT AS FAR AS WHAT

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:32.330
INSTITUTIONS ARE BUILT WITH

00:35:32.396 --> 00:35:34.098
WHAT KIND OF PROGRAMMING SPACE

00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:35.867
AND IT ALL OFTENTIMES HAS TO DO

00:35:35.933 --> 00:35:36.434
WITH THE TIME THAT THEY'RE

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:39.704
BUILT RIGHT CTF FOR EXAMPLE OR

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:40.304
CALIFORNIA TRADE FACILITY IT

00:35:40.371 --> 00:35:41.906
WAS BUILT AT A TIME. WHERE

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:45.610
REHABILITATION WAS PART OF THE

00:35:45.676 --> 00:35:46.244
GAME THEY HAVE LOTS OF PROGRAM

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.945
SPACE I WOULD ALSO PRESENT LOTS

00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:51.482
OF PROGRAM SPACE SO IT JUST

00:35:51.549 --> 00:35:52.083
REALLY KIND OF DEPENDS UPON

00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:53.851
EACH INSTITUTION I WISH I COULD

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:55.853
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.855
WELDING I WISH I COULD HAVE

00:35:57.922 --> 00:35:59.657
EVER CIVIL PRISON. AND EVERY

00:35:59.724 --> 00:36:01.692
SINGLE YARD I MIGHT HAVE A ONE

00:36:01.759 --> 00:36:03.528
YOUR BUT NOT ANOTHER YARD SO I

00:36:03.594 --> 00:36:04.161
MEAN WE DO HAVE A CHALLENGE TO

00:36:04.228 --> 00:36:07.798
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE FAIR

00:36:07.865 --> 00:36:08.366
NEXT LITTLE PROGRAMS RATHER

00:36:08.432 --> 00:36:13.971
INSTITUTIONS. THAT'S WHAT YOU

00:36:14.038 --> 00:36:15.506
AND I VISITED SALINAS VALLEY

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:16.107
JUST A FEW TO GO NUTS WILL BE.

00:36:16.173 --> 00:36:17.775
WE NOTICE RIGHT YOU'RE AT. A

00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:19.944
FIVE A PRETTY AMAZING WELDING

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:21.712
PROGRAM ONE YARD. BUT THE OTHER

00:36:21.779 --> 00:36:23.881
THREE YARDS COULDN'T. ACCESS

00:36:23.948 --> 00:36:24.448
THAT PROGRAM EVEN THOUGH IS

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:27.985
JUST A FEW. FIGURE OUT HOW DO

00:36:28.052 --> 00:36:31.789
WE- LEVERAGE THAT AMAZING

00:36:31.856 --> 00:36:32.823
RESOURCES READY AT THE FACILITY.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:35.793
HOUSE ACCESS TO. HAVING THOSE

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.427
CONVERSATIONS NOW TO FIGURE OUT

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:39.664
HOW WE CAN. MAXIMIZE

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:40.197
UTILIZATION THE SPACE THE

00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:45.937
PROGRAM. WELL THERE ARE TWO

00:36:46.003 --> 00:36:46.537
SIMPLE ANSWERS PROBABLY WHICH

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:49.607
YOU KNOW OUR ANYONE IS A USE

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:51.676
EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS ONLY OR

00:36:51.742 --> 00:36:53.611
TWO IF YOU'RE GONNA USE NON

00:36:53.678 --> 00:36:55.646
EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS THEY

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:57.882
SHOULD COME WITH THEY SHOULD BE

00:36:57.949 --> 00:37:01.652
CUT PAIRED WITH MONEY TO ALLOW

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:03.654
THEM TO BE EVALUATED TO

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:05.590
DETERMINE WHETHER THEY'RE

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:07.625
SUCCESSFUL OR NOT AND THE THIRD

00:37:07.692 --> 00:37:08.225
THING WHICH OF OFTEN IS THE

00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:11.662
HARDEST IS TO GET RID OF THE

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:13.664
PROGRAMS THAT PEOPLE FEEL GOOD

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:15.533
ABOUT. THAT ARE NOT EFFECTIVE.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.100
GEN OF JUVENILE JUSTICE HAS

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:17.501
COME A LONG WAY IN DOING THAT

00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:18.102
THEY SO I KNOW IT CAN BE DONE

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:23.541
AS TO YOUR- COMMENT ABOUT SCALE.

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:25.676
YEAH THAT'S THE MAIN PROBLEM

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:27.778
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:29.847
UNDER WATER WELDERS OR HOW MANY

00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:30.481
FISH. YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO

00:37:30.548 --> 00:37:31.949
TRAIN ON OUR WELDERS ARE THEY

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:35.519
HAVE A HORSE PROGRAM AND SEE I

00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:36.087
AM. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A

00:37:36.153 --> 00:37:39.557
HANDFUL OF PEOPLE IN A SEA OF.

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:41.626
PEOPLE HUNDRED OVER A HUNDRED

00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:43.661
THOUSAND PEOPLE SO. I THINK.

00:37:43.728 --> 00:37:47.965
YOU KNOW IF I WERE. IN CHECKING

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:49.600
AS SOMEBODY. HE SAID. I WOULD

00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:51.669
MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAMS

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:53.771
THAT THEY DO OFFER OFFER THEM

00:37:53.838 --> 00:37:55.673
TO THE MOST NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.808
AVAILABLE AND I'M NOT SURE

00:37:57.875 --> 00:37:59.343
THAT. THAT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER

00:37:59.410 --> 00:37:59.877
THAT CRITERIA HAS BEEN IN

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:03.781
EFFECT OR NOT. WE HAVE

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:05.783
RECOMMENDED THAT THE STATE

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.652
CONTRACT WITH EXTERNAL

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:08.252
RESEARCHERS TO CONDUCT COST

00:38:08.319 --> 00:38:09.787
EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES OF CDC

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:12.189
OUR REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AND

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:12.790
MY COLLEAGUE PLANS TO DESCRIBE

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:15.626
THAT. ON THE THIRD PANEL. YEAH

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:18.029
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:38:18.095 --> 00:38:19.563
SUSPECT I'M SURE YOU WHERE WE

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.966
HAVE WE LOOK INTO THE ISSUE OF.

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:25.636
OBVIOUSLY MAINTENANCE REPAIR

00:38:25.703 --> 00:38:26.203
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND OUR

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:29.573
PRISONS WE'VE BEEN GIVEN THE

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.107
INFORMATION ABOUT THE IN

00:38:30.174 --> 00:38:31.842
PICTURES AS WELL AS A HUGE

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:34.011
LEAKS AND- WROTE SOME THINGS

00:38:34.078 --> 00:38:35.646
THAT ARE FALLING APART. ONE OF

00:38:35.713 --> 00:38:37.682
THINGS WERE GRAPPLING WITH AND

00:38:37.748 --> 00:38:38.349
I GUESS IT SHOULD COME MAY COME

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:41.786
FROM CDC OURS THAT WE ARE AS WE

00:38:41.852 --> 00:38:43.554
TALK ABOUT THE DECLINE IN THE

00:38:43.621 --> 00:38:47.658
POPULATION AND WE HOPE TO.

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:48.259
QUESTION BECOMES ONCE IF WE'RE

00:38:48.325 --> 00:38:49.994
DECLINE. WE ARE HAPPY TO BE AND

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:53.698
I WANT TO BE THEN HOW DO WE

00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:55.933
PLAN AND MANAGE THE POPULATIONS

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.737
REMAINS SO WHO CAN GET TO A

00:38:59.804 --> 00:39:05.876
POINT. IN A PRISON. TO PRE

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:07.545
INTEGRATE X. AMOUNT OF SAVINGS.

00:39:07.611 --> 00:39:08.145
THE ONE THING WE FEAR IS THAT

00:39:08.212 --> 00:39:09.947
WE DON'T WANT TO PUT. SEVEN

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:11.649
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:12.283
INTO REPAIRING A PRISON THAT WE

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:13.617
TEAR DOWN THE NEXT DAY. SO

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:14.185
THAT'S THAT'S A REAL CONCERN

00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:14.752
AND SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:17.655
GRAPPLE WITH THE PRIORITY LIST.

00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:18.255
OF IF WE REDUCE THE POPULATION

00:39:18.322 --> 00:39:19.990
WHAT. SHOULD WE KEEP AND THAT'S

00:39:20.057 --> 00:39:23.728
A HOT POLITICAL ISSUE CAUSES IT

00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:24.328
SOME PEOPLE'S AREAS AND MAYBE

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:26.097
LIKE PRISONS BECAUSE IT CREATES

00:39:26.163 --> 00:39:28.099
JOBS. SO WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING

00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:29.834
WITH HOW DO YOU HOW DO WE

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.002
DEFINE WHAT PRISON IS GOING TO

00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:33.738
COME DOWN. IN ORDER TO SAVE

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:35.906
MONEY BECAUSE AS LONG AS THAT

00:39:35.973 --> 00:39:38.042
EXIST IT'S GOING TO COST AS ANY

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:41.579
TO MAINTAIN IT. AND WE INVEST A

00:39:41.645 --> 00:39:42.213
LOT OF MONEY INTO REPAIRS THAT

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:42.847
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:39:42.913 --> 00:39:45.583
YEAR ROUND. OF THAT BECOMES OF

00:39:45.649 --> 00:39:47.685
THE PUBLIC OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE.

00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:49.687
OUTRAGED AT THE FACT WE WOULD

00:39:49.754 --> 00:39:51.722
DO THAT SO IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:53.691
NOT AWARE OF ALL THESE PROBLEMS

00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:55.726
THAT WE HAVE WITH TRYING TO

00:39:55.793 --> 00:40:01.565
GRAPPLE WITH THE EASE. OF AS WE.

00:40:01.632 --> 00:40:02.032
LOOK AT THE- PLACE TO

00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:07.738
DECLINING. OF GOLD. TRY TO WE

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:09.974
TRIED TO MAN IS THE POPULATION

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:10.474
THAT YOU KNOW MANAGE THE

00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:11.942
PRISONS THAT ARE THERE AND I

00:40:12.009 --> 00:40:13.577
THINK OF MISTER KING INDICATED

00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:14.211
EARLIER IN ONE OF THE REVIEWS

00:40:14.278 --> 00:40:15.679
AND WE'VE SEEN THAT THE PRICE

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:16.313
KEEPS ONE UP BECAUSE NOW WE'VE

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.748
GOT THE SAME OUTLET THAT THE

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:18.349
SAME BUT THE ISSUE THAT THAT

00:40:18.415 --> 00:40:19.850
WOULD PUTTING OUT WITH A FEW

00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:21.619
PEOPLE SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT

00:40:21.685 --> 00:40:23.654
WE SPENDING MORE MONEY PRISONER

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:24.288
OF RIGHT NOW THAN WE WERE WHEN

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:27.525
WE HAD A SMALL POPULATION. SOME

00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:29.927
OF IT IS BECAUSE OF DESTRUCTION

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:30.561
WOULD HAVE SOME OF THIS BECAUSE

00:40:30.628 --> 00:40:31.595
WOULD DO MORE PROGRAMMING BUT

00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:35.533
BUT THE REAL SAVINGS WILL COME

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:36.133
HOPEFULLY AT SOME POINT START

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.735
SHUTTING DOWN EXPRESSIONS THEN

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:39.637
I THINK IT BECOMES IT MAKES

00:40:39.703 --> 00:40:43.541
SENSE TO DO THE REPAIRS WE HAVE

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:47.545
TO DO BUT TO. YOU KNOW. WHAT

00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:49.847
WAS HOME OF A- MILITARY BASE

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:50.414
HERE. AND IT IS BUILD A NEW

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:51.649
HOSPITAL NEW A PERFORMING ARTS

00:40:51.715 --> 00:40:52.283
CENTER. AND A COUPLE OF THE NEW

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:53.818
THINGS. AND IN THE FIFTH SET IT

00:40:53.884 --> 00:40:55.686
DOWN. SO WE HAD. TO FORMING

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:56.220
ARTS AND IS A NOBODY EVER

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:57.855
PERFORMED IN. THAT HOSPITAL

00:40:57.922 --> 00:40:59.623
NEVER HAD A BIT IN IT THAT

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:01.525
ANYBODY EVER LAID AND- AND YET

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:02.159
THEY SAID SO THE DOWN BECAUSE

00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:03.894
THEY DECIDED TO PUT. THEM CRD

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:05.663
THAT SHOULD DOWN I THINK IT WAS

00:41:05.729 --> 00:41:07.598
AND SO AS A RESULT. WHEN WE

00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:08.232
WITH THIS GREAT FACILITIES IF

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:11.769
IT JUST BILL. AND I AND I KNOW

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:12.303
SOMETIMES I CAN'T BE HELD

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:13.771
BECAUSE HOW LONG TO GET FROM

00:41:13.838 --> 00:41:14.305
THE BILL. BUT OUR CONCERN

00:41:14.371 --> 00:41:17.675
CONTINUES TO BE THAT. OF WE

00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:18.242
KNOW THE REHABILITATION SAM

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:19.944
TRYING NEW THINGS WE HAVE TO

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.712
KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. BUT IF WE

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:23.514
WANT TO CLOSE A PRISON DO WE

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:25.449
WANT TO RENOVATE IT FOR. OKAY

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:26.083
AND I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO DO

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.785
THAT SO. THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE

PRETTY GOOD SUCCESS WITH THAT.

00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:27.818
AND IS IT IS YOU GUYS KNOW THE

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:29.653
LIFE FOR POPULATION HAS REDUCED.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.557
PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY WE'VE HAD

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:34.091

THE GOVERNOR HAS ABILITY. TO DO

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:03.820
COMMUTATIONS. EVEN LIFE WITHOUT

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:11.895
HE'S REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE

00:47:11.962 --> 00:47:17.501
TO KEEP OUR INSTITUTIONS SAY.

00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:19.970
I'M TRYING TO THE HANDOUT THAT

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:21.872
I WAS SPEAKING FROM EARLIER

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:22.372
CALLED PLANNING FOR THE

00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:23.941
CLEANING IN MY PROPOSITION I'M

00:47:24.007 --> 00:47:26.043
I'M GOING TO START ON PAGE

00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:27.911
FOUR. AND ONE AND DISCUSS

00:47:27.978 --> 00:47:30.013
ACTION BUT THE STATE COULD TAKE

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:33.483
IF IT WANTED TO ACCELERATE THE

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.652
ELIMINATION OF CONTRACTS AND OR

00:47:35.719 --> 00:47:39.656
PRISON CLOSURE BEYOND WHAT

00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:40.257
WOULD BE ALLOW WHAT WHAT WOULD

00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:41.625
BE DOABLE JUST. AS THE

00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:43.527
POPULATION DECLINES NATURALLY.

00:47:43.594 --> 00:47:45.996
SERVICE THOSE OPTIONS FALL INTO

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:47.864
THREE CATEGORIES. THE FIRST

00:47:47.931 --> 00:47:49.866
WOULD BE TWO AND WILL BE A SET

00:47:49.933 --> 00:47:53.770
OF ACTIONS THAT OPTIONS THAT

00:47:53.837 --> 00:47:55.939
WOULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN

00:47:56.006 --> 00:47:59.576
THE OVERALL INMATE POPULATION.

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:01.678
AND FOR EXAMPLE ADD TO IT THAT

00:48:01.745 --> 00:48:03.614
BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS COULD

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.214
INITIATE RELEASE CONSIDERATION

00:48:04.281 --> 00:48:07.751
FOR NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS SIXTY

00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:09.686
DAYS EARLIER THAN THEY DO NOW

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:11.655
WHICH WOULD EXPEDITE RELEASES

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:12.222
AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:15.559
PREVIOUSLY RECOMMENDED. AT THE

00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:17.561
STATE COULD EXPAND ACCESS TO

00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:19.496
MINIMUM CUSTODY PLACEMENTS

00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:20.097
ALLOWING SOME INMATES TO EARN

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:23.834
MORE CREDITS. WE HAVE ALSO

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:27.671
PREVIOUSLY RECOMMENDED THIS. IN

00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:28.272
ADDITION THE STATE COULD ENACT

00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:29.506
SENTENCING CHANGES ISN'T

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:31.575
ENCOMPASSES A WIDE VARIETY OF

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:33.877
POSSIBILITIES FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:35.912
STATE COULD EXPAND ELIGIBILITY

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:37.581
FOR THE ELDERLY OR YOUTH

00:48:37.648 --> 00:48:39.616
OFFENDER PAROLE PROCESS SEAT.

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:42.185
AND THEN I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE

00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:43.920
THAT THERE'S ANOTHER A WITH A

00:48:43.987 --> 00:48:46.089
WIDE VARIETY OF OPTIONS AS FAR

00:48:46.156 --> 00:48:47.991
AS AND IT'S EASY ARE CAN PURSUE

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:49.860
TO USING ITS AUTHORITY TO

00:48:49.926 --> 00:48:51.695
INCREASE IN MAKE CREDITS AS

00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:53.697
WELL AS RECOMMENDING INMATES TO

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:55.799
THE COURTS FOR RE SENTENCING

00:48:55.866 --> 00:48:56.366
UNDER THAT ELEVEN SEVENTY D.

00:48:56.433 --> 00:49:00.103
PROCESS. THE THIRD EXCUSE ME

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:01.705
THE SECOND CATEGORY OF OPTIONS

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:03.940
WAY TO YES THE ACTIONS THAT

00:49:04.007 --> 00:49:05.909
WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

00:49:05.976 --> 00:49:07.678
INMATES IN PLACEMENTS. THAT ARE

00:49:07.744 --> 00:49:10.447
OUTSIDE OF THE THIRTY FOUR

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:11.548
PRISONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:13.817
COURT ORDERED POPULATION CAP.

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:15.919
SUCH AS CONSERVATION CAMPS SO

00:49:15.986 --> 00:49:17.921
FOR EXAMPLE AND THE STATE COULD

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:19.489
INCREASE THE CAN'T CONSERVATION

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:21.825
CAMP POPULATION BY EXPANDING IN

00:49:21.892 --> 00:49:23.727
MADE ELIGIBILITY FOR CAMPS OR

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:25.996
INCREASING INCENTIVES FOR

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:26.463
INMATES TO CHOOSE TO

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:27.998
PARTICIPATE IN CAMPS. THIS IS

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:28.565
SOMETHING WE'VE PREVIOUSLY

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:31.468
RECOMMENDED. IN ADDITION THE

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:32.102
STATE COULD ALLOW MORE INMATES

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:35.706
TO SERVE THE LAST PORTION OF

00:49:35.772 --> 00:49:36.173
THEIR SENTENCE IN THE

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:37.541
ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY PROGRAM.

00:49:37.607 --> 00:49:39.576
AND THEN TURNING THE PAGE TO

00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:43.513
PAGE FIVE. THE THIRD A CATEGORY

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.749
OF OPTIONS WOULD BE TO

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.851
ESSENTIALLY OPERATE THE THIRTY

00:49:47.918 --> 00:49:49.519
FOUR PRISONS WITH A SMALLER

00:49:49.586 --> 00:49:50.087
BUFFER WHICH IS SOMETHING I

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:51.855
MENTIONED ON PANEL ONE AND- AT

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:53.990
THAT THE STATE IS ALLOWED TO

00:49:54.057 --> 00:49:55.692
HOUSE UP TO A HUNDRED AND

00:49:55.759 --> 00:49:56.293
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND INMATES IN

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.928
ITS- THIRTY FOUR PRESENCE. BUT

00:49:57.994 --> 00:50:01.498
CHOOSES THE HOUSE ABOUT ABOUT A

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:02.099
HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND JUST

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:03.900
TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BUFFER

00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:05.669
IN CASE THERE'S AN UNEXPECTED

00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:07.804
INCREASE. SO THIS OPTION WOULD

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:09.840
JUST INVOLVE HOUSING HERE IN ME

00:50:09.906 --> 00:50:11.842
AN EXCUSE ME HOUSING MORE

00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:13.677
INMATES IN STATE OWNED AND

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:15.512
OPERATED PRISONS AND THEREFORE

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:17.581
OPERATING A SMALLER BUFFER. AND

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:19.583
THE STATE CHOSE THIS OPTION IT

00:50:19.649 --> 00:50:21.618
MAY WANT TO TAKE ADDITIONAL

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:23.787
ACTIONS TO MITIGATE THE

00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:24.388
INCREASED RISK OF VIOLATING A

00:50:24.454 --> 00:50:29.860
COURT ORDER. YES SOME OF NEXT

00:50:29.926 --> 00:50:31.762
GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MATT

00:50:31.828 --> 00:50:33.530
KATE I WAS THE INSPECTOR

00:50:33.597 --> 00:50:34.131
GENERAL OF THE PRISON SYSTEM

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:35.999
FROM 200-042-2000 EIGHT AND THE

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:37.901
SECRETARY FROM TWO THOUSAND

00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:38.468
EIGHT TO THE END OF. TWENTY

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:41.805
TWELVE. I'M CURRENTLY IN

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:43.707
PRIVATE SECTOR. FROM MY

00:50:43.774 --> 00:50:45.842
PERSPECTIVE WE BUILT THE WRONG

00:50:45.909 --> 00:50:49.613
PRISONS BUT EVERYONE DID RIGHT

00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:50.213
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. I AM

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.583
VERY EXPENSIVE TO BUILD A TWO

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:54.217
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PLUS

00:50:54.284 --> 00:50:56.019
VERY EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN AS

00:50:56.086 --> 00:50:57.788
YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD. I'M AN

00:50:57.854 --> 00:50:59.790
EXCELLENT DESIGN FOR PREVENTING

00:50:59.856 --> 00:51:03.527
ESCAPES A VERY POOR DESIGN FOR.

00:51:03.593 --> 00:51:04.127
OUR PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:05.529
CARE AND REHABILITATIVE

00:51:05.595 --> 00:51:07.898
PROGRAMS. THE SITE THE SOUND

00:51:07.964 --> 00:51:10.033
THE SMILE THE TEMPERATURE ALL

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.968
POORLY DESIGNED FOR PROVIDING A

00:51:12.035 --> 00:51:15.705
THERAPEUTIC MILIEU. AND SO WHAT

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:19.509
DO YOU DO THEY'RE TOO EXPENSIVE

00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:20.110
TO TEAR DOWN AND TOO EXPENSIVE

00:51:20.177 --> 00:51:23.947
TO REBUILD. THE ANSWER FROM MY

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:24.448
PERSPECTIVE IS REDUCING

00:51:24.514 --> 00:51:25.582
POPULATION THROUGH REDUCING

00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:27.984
RECIDIVISM. 300-003-8000

00:51:28.051 --> 00:51:29.786
INMATES ARE RELEASED EVERY YEAR

00:51:29.853 --> 00:51:32.022
INTO OUR COMMUNITIES IF YOU CAN

00:51:32.088 --> 00:51:35.659
REDUCE RECIDIVISM BY 10% THAT'S

00:51:35.725 --> 00:51:37.661
ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND INMATES A

00:51:37.727 --> 00:51:39.629
YEAR. RIGHT AND THAT NUMBER

00:51:39.696 --> 00:51:41.565
DECLINES EACH YEAR AND SO ON.

00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:43.967
HOW DO YOU DO THAT I THINK THE

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:45.802
DEPARTMENT AND THE LEGISLATURE

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:47.804
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS ON THE

00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:49.840
RIGHT TRACK. CURRENT THERE'S

00:51:49.906 --> 00:51:52.075
CURRENTLY AN INVITATION FOR BED

00:51:52.142 --> 00:51:53.777
OUT THAT IS GOING TO EXPAND

00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:55.512
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS IN THE

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:56.179
PRISONS IMPROVE THEM AS YOU'VE

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:57.881
HEARD FROM THE WEBSITE AND ALSO

00:51:57.948 --> 00:51:59.816
OFFICE I THINK THAT'S

00:51:59.883 --> 00:52:01.651
IMPORTANT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:03.753
THE SECRET SAUCE IS TO COMBINE

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.622
THOSE IN PRISON PROGRAMS WITH

00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:07.757
EFFECTIVE AFTER CARE AND

00:52:07.824 --> 00:52:09.626
RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. SINCE

00:52:09.693 --> 00:52:11.528
LEAVING THE DEPARTMENT I JOIN

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:12.195
THE BOARD OF THE ENTIRE CITIZEN

00:52:12.262 --> 00:52:15.632
COALITION AND LOS ANGELES ALSO.

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:17.701
HAVE TAKEN ON AS CLIENTS A

00:52:17.767 --> 00:52:19.536
COUPLE OF NONPROFIT PROVIDERS

00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:21.805
WHO ARE PART OF THE MEN'S

00:52:21.872 --> 00:52:23.540
COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAM AND

00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:26.009
ALSO THAT THE FEMALE VERSION

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:29.779
CALLED THE CZ TRP. FOR MY

00:52:29.846 --> 00:52:30.380
PERSPECTIVE RIGHT NOW THERE'S

00:52:30.447 --> 00:52:31.748
ABOUT A THOUSAND OF THOSE BEDS

00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:32.349
IN THOSE BEDS FOR EXAMPLE FOR

00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:32.883
THE MEN AND THEY CAN BE

00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:33.950
RELEASED UP TO FOURTEEN MONTHS.

00:52:34.017 --> 00:52:35.819
BEFORE THE END OF THEIR

00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:37.721
SENTENCE. TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL

00:52:37.787 --> 00:52:39.756
COMMUNITIES IN THOSE PROGRAMS

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:43.527
THEY CAN RECEIVE. NOT ONLY RYAN

00:52:43.593 --> 00:52:45.729
EDUCATION BUT TRUE WRAPAROUND

00:52:45.795 --> 00:52:46.196
SERVICES SOMETHING THE

00:52:46.263 --> 00:52:47.898
DEPARTMENT CAN'T REALLY PROVIDE

00:52:47.964 --> 00:52:49.833
BECAUSE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.701
CHALLENGES. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:53.670
TO GET THE RIGHT IN MADE IN THE

00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:54.304
RIGHT PROGRAM AT THE RIGHT TIME

00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:57.841
IN THE STATE THIS BIG. BUT IN A

00:52:57.908 --> 00:52:59.676
COMMUNITY RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM

00:52:59.743 --> 00:53:01.845
FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S ONE IN

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:03.880
ASSEMBLY MEMBER JOHN STORAGE

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:04.347
DISTRICT THAT'S REALLY

00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:05.949
EXCELLENT THEY DO A VERY NICE

00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:09.653
JOB. BUT WHEN THOSE INMATES

00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:11.555
COMPLETE THEIR PROGRAMS THEY

00:53:11.621 --> 00:53:13.657
HAVE JOBS THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT

00:53:13.723 --> 00:53:15.592
OF HOUSING THAT WRAP AROUND

00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:17.827
SERVICES. I TO ADDRESS THERE

00:53:17.894 --> 00:53:19.629
ARE. ANY OUR CRIMINAL GENIC

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:21.531
NEEDS THAT THEY MAY STILL HAVE

00:53:21.598 --> 00:53:22.098
IN THE EARLY INDICATIONS ARE

00:53:22.165 --> 00:53:25.535
YOU'LL GET THE KIND OF OUR

00:53:25.602 --> 00:53:26.202
RECIDIVISM REDUCTIONS THAT THAT

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:27.871
THE STATE NEEDS. SO WHAT ARE

00:53:27.938 --> 00:53:30.006
THE RISKS IN MY PURSE FROM MY

00:53:30.073 --> 00:53:32.008
PERSPECTIVE THE REST OF LARGELY

00:53:32.075 --> 00:53:33.777
POLITICAL. I THESE INMATES

00:53:33.843 --> 00:53:35.979
SHOULD THEY WALK AWAY FROM

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:37.881
THESE FACILITIES AND COMMIT A

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:38.415
CRIME THAT'S A POLITICAL

00:53:38.481 --> 00:53:39.983
PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNOR. FOR

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.718
THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE

00:53:41.785 --> 00:53:45.855
LEGISLATURE. BUT THE TRUTH IS

00:53:45.922 --> 00:53:46.456
THESE INMATES WERE GOING TO BE

00:53:46.523 --> 00:53:49.826
RELEASED ANYWAY. AND SO RELEASE

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:51.962
IN THEM AND A MATTER OF MONTHS

00:53:52.028 --> 00:53:52.462
EARLIER THAN THEY WOULD

00:53:52.529 --> 00:53:53.797
OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:54.397
A SETTING WHERE THEY HAVE THE

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:55.832
BEST CHANCE TO SUCCEED.

00:53:55.899 --> 00:53:57.934
ACTUALLY IN FROM WILL REDUCE

00:53:58.001 --> 00:53:59.436
THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS IN

00:53:59.502 --> 00:53:59.970
CALIFORNIA MAKE IT A SAFER

00:54:00.036 --> 00:54:03.540
PLACE TO LIVE. WILL HELP THOSE

00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:04.107
THOSE INDIVIDUALS RE ENTER

00:54:04.174 --> 00:54:05.809
SUCCESSFUL WEIGHT I DON'T

00:54:05.875 --> 00:54:07.844
THAT'S NOT ONLY AN ISSUE FOR

00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:09.613
THAT INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEING BUT

00:54:09.679 --> 00:54:10.180
ALSO FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND

00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:11.715
THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND HAS A

00:54:11.781 --> 00:54:13.617
RIPPLE EFFECT I THINK ACROSS

00:54:13.683 --> 00:54:15.819
CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S WHERE I

00:54:15.885 --> 00:54:17.721
WOULD INVEST MY MIND MY MONEY

00:54:17.787 --> 00:54:19.756
AND MY TIME IF I WERE IN YOUR

00:54:19.823 --> 00:54:21.925
CHAIRS. RIGHT NOW THERE'S ONLY

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:23.560
A THOUSAND FIFTY OF THOSE BEDS

00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:24.094
I THINK THE STATE SHOULD

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.895
INCREASE THOSE NUMBERS OVER

00:54:25.962 --> 00:54:27.731
TIME AGAIN I REPRESENT SOME OF

00:54:27.797 --> 00:54:29.566
THE NONPROFIT TO DO THIS WORK

00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:31.668
IN ALL CANDOR BUT- I DO THAT

00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:33.903
BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE DOING

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:34.504
THE RIGHT THING. FOR THE RIGHT

00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:41.645
REASONS THANK YOU. GOOD

00:54:41.711 --> 00:54:43.880
AFTERNOON MY NAME IS NATASHA

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:45.548
MINSKER I'M AN ATTORNEY AND

00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:46.049
CONSULTANT AND I'VE BEEN

00:54:46.116 --> 00:54:47.584
WORKING ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:49.686
ISSUES FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS. MY

00:54:49.753 --> 00:54:51.621
TOPIC IS FRONT AND SOLUTIONS TO

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:53.657
REDUCING THE PRISON POPULATION.

00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:54.290
AND I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON TWO

00:54:54.357 --> 00:54:57.694
APPROACHES. ONE GIVE PUBLIC

00:54:57.761 --> 00:54:59.963
DEFENDERS THE RESOURCES THEY

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:01.631
NEED TO DO THEIR JOBS WELL. AN

00:55:01.698 --> 00:55:05.802
TO SENTENCING REFORM. YEAH WHAT

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:07.737
A LOT OF ATTENTION HAS BEEN

00:55:07.804 --> 00:55:09.739
PLACATE TO THE ROLE OF JUDGES

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:11.841
AND PROSECUTORS IN OUR CRIMINAL

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.677
JUSTICE SYSTEM VERY LITTLE

00:55:13.743 --> 00:55:14.277
ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE ROLE

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:17.681
OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. IT IS

00:55:17.747 --> 00:55:19.716
THE JOB OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER

00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:20.283
TO KEEP THEIR CLIENT OUT OF

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:21.918
PRISON. LET'S GIVE THEM THE

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:25.622
RESOURCES TO DO THAT JOB WELL.

00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:27.891
IF PUBLIC DEFENDERS HAD MORE

00:55:27.957 --> 00:55:29.926
RESOURCES THEY WOULD DO A

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:31.795
BETTER JOB OF PROTECTING

00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:32.395
INNOCENT PEOPLE FROM WRONGFUL

00:55:32.462 --> 00:55:35.665
CONVICTION. AND THEY WOULD DO A

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:37.467
BETTER JOB CONFRONTING THE

00:55:37.534 --> 00:55:39.602
ROUTINE OVER CHARGING BY

00:55:39.669 --> 00:55:41.671
PROSECUTORS THAT LEADS TO

00:55:41.738 --> 00:55:42.272
UNFAIR AND UNNECESSARILY LONG

00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:47.711
SENTENCES. PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE

00:55:47.777 --> 00:55:49.913
ALSO IN DAILY CONTACT WITH THE

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:50.380
NEEDIEST PEOPLE IN OUR

00:55:50.447 --> 00:55:53.717
COMMUNITIES. SONICALLY HOMELESS

00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:55.819
PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL

00:55:55.885 --> 00:55:56.286
ILLNESS IN PEOPLE WITH

00:55:56.352 --> 00:55:59.723
SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES. I CAN'T

00:55:59.789 --> 00:56:00.323
TELL YOU THE NUMBER OF TIMES

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:01.825
THAT AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER I

00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:02.358
SAID TO A JUDGE. MY CLIENT

00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:05.829
NEEDS A PROGRAM. AND I WAS MET

00:56:05.895 --> 00:56:09.599
WITH THE RETORT. WE HAVE A

00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:10.166
PROGRAM FOR YOUR CLIENT IT'S

00:56:10.233 --> 00:56:11.701
CALLED STATE PRISON. WHAT A

00:56:11.768 --> 00:56:13.970
NUMBER OF TIMES I QUOTE

00:56:14.037 --> 00:56:15.939
SUCCEEDED I GETTING MY CLIENT

00:56:16.005 --> 00:56:19.642
OUT OF JAIL AND WONDERED WHY

00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:20.243
SINCE HE WOULD BE SLEEPING ON

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:23.947
THE STREETS THAT NIGHT. IMAGINE

00:56:24.013 --> 00:56:25.615
A WORLD IN WHICH PUBLIC

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.650
DEFENDERS HAD SOCIAL WORKERS

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:29.652
AND NAVIGATORS TO HELP THEIR

00:56:29.719 --> 00:56:32.021
CLIENTS FIND STABLE HOUSING AND

00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:35.859
TREATMENT. WORLD IN WHICH FROM

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:37.627
THE FIRST ENCOUNTER PUBLIC

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:39.729
DEFENDER COULD SAY HOW CAN I

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:43.733
HELP WHAT DO YOU NEED HOW DO WE

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.735
KEEP YOU OUT OF PRISON FOREVER.

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:47.971
WE HAVE AN ARMY OF ADVOCATES

00:56:48.037 --> 00:56:49.973
WORKING TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:51.741
PRISON AND HELP THE NEEDIEST

00:56:51.808 --> 00:56:53.676
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. LET'S

00:56:53.743 --> 00:56:54.277
GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES TO DO

00:56:54.344 --> 00:57:01.785
THAT JOB WELL. I WANT TO

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:03.520
ADDRESS IN SENTENCING REFORM.

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:05.922
IF THE ROLE OF JUDGES TO DECIDE

00:57:05.989 --> 00:57:07.824
WHAT THE APPROPRIATE AND FAIR

00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:09.726
SENSES IN AN INDIVIDUAL CASE

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:11.561
AND IF THE ROLE OF THE

00:57:11.628 --> 00:57:13.463
LEGISLATURE TO SET THE

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:15.832
PARAMETERS FOR JUDGES TO ENSURE

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:17.667
FAIR AND JUST SENSE IS AN

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:19.702
INDIVIDUAL CASES AND TO SERVE

00:57:19.769 --> 00:57:20.303
THE INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIANS

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:25.975
AS A WHOLE. OUR SENTENCING LAWS

00:57:26.042 --> 00:57:26.576
FAILED TO ACHIEVE THOSE BASIC

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:30.079
GOALS. I'M GONNA SUGGEST FIVE

00:57:30.146 --> 00:57:32.081
SPECIFIC SENSING REFORMS THE

00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:35.785
LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER. ONE I

00:57:35.852 --> 00:57:37.754
WOMEN EIGHT THE REMAINING

00:57:37.821 --> 00:57:39.889
RESTRICTIONS THAT PREVENT

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:42.025
JUDGES FROM CHOOSING A SENTENCE

00:57:42.091 --> 00:57:45.662
OTHER THAN PRISON. GIVE JUDGES

00:57:45.728 --> 00:57:46.196
FULL DISCRETION TO CHOOSE

00:57:46.262 --> 00:57:49.465
PROBATION OR CHOOSE A PROGRAM

00:57:49.532 --> 00:57:51.467
WHERE TO STRIKE AN ENHANCEMENT

00:57:51.534 --> 00:57:52.101
SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO GO

00:57:52.168 --> 00:57:55.972
TO PRISON. TO ADDRESS THE

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:59.876
CONTINUING LEGACY OF THE WAR ON

00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:01.678
DRUGS IN OUR SENTENCING LAWS.

00:58:01.744 --> 00:58:05.648
THAT SENDS THE LOWEST POSSIBLE

00:58:05.715 --> 00:58:07.617
SENDS FOR SALE OF COCAINE

00:58:07.684 --> 00:58:08.251
INCLUDING CRACK. IS THREE YEARS

00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:11.721
STATE PRISON. THE LOWEST

00:58:11.788 --> 00:58:13.790
POSSIBLE SENDS FOR SALE OF

00:58:13.857 --> 00:58:17.694
HEROIN IS SIXTEEN MONTHS. THAT

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.629
SPECIFIC DISPARITY ADDRESSING

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:20.263
BACK TO SEVERITY WOULD HAVE THE

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:21.998
BIGGEST IMPACT ON OUR JAIL

00:58:22.065 --> 00:58:23.933
POPULATIONS IT IS A STARK

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.035
EXAMPLE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH

00:58:26.102 --> 00:58:29.572
THE WAR ON DRUGS CONTINUES TO

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:30.173
IMPACT OUR SENTENCING LAWS AND

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.676
UNFAIR WAY. THREE THE

00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:37.580
LEGISLATURE SHOULD RE EVALUATE

00:58:37.647 --> 00:58:39.716
SENTENCES. FOR THE OFFENSES

00:58:39.782 --> 00:58:41.684
THAT LEAD TO THE LARGEST NUMBER

00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:42.318
OF PRISON COMMITMENTS WHICH ARE

00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:45.922
SALT AND ROBBERY. IF WE WERE TO

00:58:45.989 --> 00:58:47.991
REDUCE THE LOWEST POSSIBLE

00:58:48.057 --> 00:58:51.561
SENSE FROM SIXTEEN MONTHS TO

00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:52.161
TWELVE MONTHS OR EVEN FOURTEEN

00:58:52.228 --> 00:58:55.932
MONTHS. JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:57.834
LESS ABOUT WHAT WAS SENDS.

00:58:57.901 --> 00:58:59.636
BECAUSE IT IMPACTS A LARGE

00:58:59.702 --> 00:59:01.838
NUMBER OF PEOPLE IT WOULD HAVE

00:59:01.905 --> 00:59:02.472
A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE

00:59:02.538 --> 00:59:03.873
POPULATION WITH HAVING NO

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:07.744
IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY. FOUR

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:09.779
WE NEED TO BRING BACK THE

00:59:09.846 --> 00:59:11.547
COMMONSENSE RULES WE USED TO

00:59:11.614 --> 00:59:13.650
HAVE THAT LIMITED STACKING

00:59:13.716 --> 00:59:15.785
ENHANCEMENTS AND SENSES ONE ON

00:59:15.852 --> 00:59:21.791
TOP OF THE. WE USE RULES IN

00:59:21.858 --> 00:59:23.693
CALIFORNIA THAT SAID YOU CAN'T

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.495
HAVE AN ENHANCEMENT FOR USE OF

00:59:25.561 --> 00:59:27.730
A WEAPON AND THEN I ALSO HAVE

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:29.499
AN ENHANCEMENT FOR THE INJURY

00:59:29.565 --> 00:59:31.567
THAT THAT WEAPON BECAUSE- AND

00:59:31.634 --> 00:59:32.201
HAVE ANOTHER ENHANCEMENT ON ON

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:34.070
TOP OF THAT. WE USED TO HAVE

00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:37.674
RULES THAT SAID THE STANDS FOR

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:39.776
YOUR OFFENSE. NEEDS TO BE THE

00:59:39.842 --> 00:59:41.711
LARGEST PART YOUR SENTENCE AND

00:59:41.778 --> 00:59:43.913
ENHANCEMENTS NEED TO BE JUST A

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:47.650
TINY PORTION ADDED ON. WE GOT

00:59:47.717 --> 00:59:49.652
RID OF THOSE RULES. AND THEN

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:52.021
EXTREME SENSING BECAME THE NORM

00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:54.057
IN CALIFORNIA AND OUR PRISON

00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:55.658
POPULATION EXPLODED WE NEED TO

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:57.927
BRING BACK THOSE COMMONSENSE

00:59:57.994 --> 00:59:58.494
RULES THEY WORKED ONCE THEY

00:59:58.561 --> 01:00:01.731
WILL WORK AGAIN. THE

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:05.635
LEGISLATURE SHOULD DO MORE TO

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:06.202
ADDRESS BY CARRIER LIABILITY

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:08.037
THAT'S WHEN ONE. IS PUNISHED

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:08.604
FOR THE BEHAVIOR OF ANOTHER

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:12.041
PERSON. YOU DID A GREAT JOB

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:13.943
MADE A GREAT START WITH THE

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:15.712
FELONY MURDER RULE BUT WE HAVE

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:17.613
MORE ENHANCEMENTS AND MORE

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.716
OFFENSES THAT PUNISH ONE PERSON

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:21.751
FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S BEHAVIOR FOR

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:24.053
EXAMPLE THE GUN ENHANCEMENT. WE

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.490
CAN ADD TEN OR TWENTY YEARS ON

01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:30.093
A PERSON'S SENTENCE WHEN THEY

01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:33.496
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A GUN. WE NEED

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:34.097
TO ENSURE THAT IN CALIFORNIA

01:00:34.163 --> 01:00:35.999
YOU ARE ONLY SENDS AND HELD

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:36.499
RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:43.740
BEHAVIOR. FINALLY THIS IS

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.875
OUTSIDE OF THE REALM OF THE

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:47.510
LEGISLATURE BUT ANY

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:48.144
CONVERSATION ABOUT REDUCING THE

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:51.581
PRISON POPULATION HAS TO

01:00:51.647 --> 01:00:52.181
INCLUDE MENTION OF THE THREE

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:53.816
STRIKES LAW. THE SINGLE MOST

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:55.718
IMPORTANT REFORM TO REDUCING

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:57.687
OUR PRISON POPULATION AND

01:00:57.754 --> 01:00:59.789
ENDING EXTREME SENSING IT'S TO

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:05.695
REPEAL THE THREE STRIKES LAW.

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:06.262
THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:13.536
DISCUSSING THESE IDEAS WITH YOU.

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:16.139
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:17.940
THINK EVERYONE IS SPOKEN RIGHT

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:19.742
OKAY WONDERFUL OF THE ANY OF

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:20.343
THE MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:35.658
COMMENTS. YEAH. MINE WORKS HERE.

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:42.131
SO. MAYBE IT IS ANYONE CAN IT

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:44.634
GET ENOUGH. WE TRY TO ADDRESS

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:47.670
THIS PART OF WHAT EACH OF YOUR

01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:49.772
ST IS A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:53.576
WAY WE DEAL WITH GROW JUSTICE

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:54.210
IN GENERAL I JUST GOT BACK FROM

01:01:54.277 --> 01:01:59.515
NORWAY. IN NORWAY. THEY BELIEVE

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:01.851
THAT THE SENTENCE THE JUDGE

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:03.853
GIVE YOU IS YOUR PUNISHMENT.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.588
PLUS THEY WILL ALSO SAY YOU

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:06.155
CAN'T SERVE MORE THAN TWENTY

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:09.759
YEARS WHICH MEANS. WHEN YOU GO

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:10.193
TO PRISON IT'S ABOUT

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:11.894
REHABILITATION. BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:15.598
COMING OUT WHAT YOU KILL ONE

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:16.132
PERSON OR TWO HUNDRED ONE

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:17.934
PEOPLE THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.836
YOU MIGHT COME OUT AGAINST

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:21.737
WOMEN TO REHABILITATE IF YOU

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:23.739
STILL WANNA GRAIN OF CORN OR OR

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:25.675
BUSH A GREATER QUIRK YOU'RE

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:26.209
COMING OUT SO WE NEED TO

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:29.612
REBUILD SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF

01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:33.449
PROGRAMS THERE. THAT THAT THAT.

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:34.016
WHAT PART OF IN THIS IS THE

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:35.818
POLITICAL THING. THE REASON

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:37.753
THAT STARTED. THIS WHOLE

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:41.591
PARADIGM SHIFT. IS NUMBER TWO

01:02:41.657 --> 01:02:43.593
DURING THE **** OCCUPATION. OF

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:45.895
THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS WERE IN

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:47.763
CONCENTRATION CAMPS. AND WHEN

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:51.834
THEY GET OUT THEY CAN BEGIN TO

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:52.368
PRIME MINISTER ANY RAN THE

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:53.903
COUNTRY. IN THEIR MIND THEY

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:55.905
HAVE A SAYING IF YOU WANT

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:57.807
REFORM TO PRISON SYSTEM YOU

01:02:57.874 --> 01:02:58.407
NEED SEND EVERY POLITICIAN TO

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:07.583
PRESENT. ARE YOU VOLUNTEERING.

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:09.852
I KNOW IT SOUNDS FUNNY BUT

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:11.787
BECAUSE THEY WERE IN PRISON AND

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:13.589
ALL THE ATROCITIES THAT THE

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:17.693
NAZI'S INFLICTED ON THEM IN

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.327
MIND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TRY TO

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:19.795
CHANGE THE PUBLIC'S. VERSION OF

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:23.833
VISION OF WHAT. THE ABILITY

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.668
ASIAN SHOULD BE ENRICHED EXCEPT

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:27.803
IT WAS DIFFICULT BUT THEY HAD A

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:29.539
AN INFRASTRUCTURE OF

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:31.541
POLITICIANS WHO WERE. PRESENT

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:35.912
AND WOOD. THE CHANGES IN OUR

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:38.247
PRIME MINISTER TIME DID THAT

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:39.615
AND SO THIS IS A HUGE LEFT IS

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:45.888
NOT AS EASY AS AS AS WE WOULD

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:50.226
THINK AND SO I. TO JOIN WITH US

01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:51.794
TO TRY TO CHANGE MINDS IF

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:53.963
ANYONE THOUGHT ABOUT. YOU KNOW

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:55.932
IT YET THESE ARE GREAT PROGRAMS

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:56.465
ARE GREAT BUT IF YOU EVER

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:57.867
THOUGHT ABOUT HOW DO WE PUT

01:03:57.934 --> 01:04:01.704
TOGETHER THAT THIS THIS WHOLE

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:03.606
NEW SYSTEM BUT ALSO TO CONVINCE

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.841
THE PUBLIC. THAT THIS IS GOOD

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:06.442
NOT LEAVE IT WOULD JUST ONE

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:07.910
EXAMPLE I WAS ABLE TO GET A

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:09.512
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:11.714
REHABILITATION EARLY ON IN MY

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:13.816
CAREER IN TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:14.450
THIRTEEN BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:17.453
CONVINCE REPUBLICANS AND PEOPLE

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.054
WHO ARE. THREE STRIKES LAW IN

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.891
ORDER TO SAY. IT COSTS TOO MUCH

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:23.726
TO SEND PEOPLE TO PRISON. I CAN

01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:24.227
SAVE YOU EIGHTY THOUSAND

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:27.863
DOLLARS A YEAR IF YOU GIVE ME A

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:28.431
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:30.666
GIVE YOU A BILLION DOLLARS BACK

01:04:30.733 --> 01:04:31.200
SO THEY GAVE ME A HUNDRED

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:32.268
MILLION DOLLARS TO DO

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:35.504
REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. AND

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:36.072
YOU COULD SELL THAT TO THE

01:04:36.138 --> 01:04:37.974
PUBLIC AND THEY COULD THEY

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.775
COULD GRASP IN JUNE AT AND SO I

01:04:39.842 --> 01:04:41.677
HAVE. THOUGHT ABOUT HOW TO TOOK

01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:43.779
TO MAKE THIS MORE PALATABLE TO

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:45.648
THOSE WHO MAY NOT BE AS

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.550
OBVIOUSLY RECEPTIVE IS THIS

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:49.885
AUDIENCE TO TRY THESE IDEAS

01:04:49.952 --> 01:04:51.621
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST US IN

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:53.456
THIS ROOM WE'VE GOT TO CONVINCE

01:04:53.522 --> 01:04:57.560
SOME PEOPLE OUTSIDE THIS ROOM.

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:58.160
WHO DON'T WHO MAY NOT BE AS IN

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:01.664
LIKE. AS WE ARE. AND

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:02.231
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING IMAGE TO

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:05.701
KATE NOW. I'LL SHOW THAT I

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:08.037
THINK ONE THE PUBLIC IS MORE ON

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:08.971
OUR SIDE THAN WE KNOW IN IN IN

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:11.907
EVERY CALL EVERY SURVEY OF THE

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:13.776
PUBLIC SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WANT

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:17.546
FUNDING FOCUSED ON. COMMUNITIES

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:19.915
SCHOOLS AND INVESTING IN HEALTH

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:21.984
CARE AND I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:23.986
IT'S ON US TO MAKE SURE THE

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:25.655
PUBLIC UNDERSTAND UNDERSTAND

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:27.790
THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:29.625
ABOUT IT WHEN WE FOR EXAMPLE

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:31.861
GIVE SOCIAL WORKERS TO PUBLIC

01:05:31.927 --> 01:05:33.796
DEFENDERS TO HELP THEIR CLIENTS

01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:35.564
FIND HOUSING AND TREATMENT.

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:37.566
THAT IS ABOUT ADDRESSING

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:38.134
HOMELESSNESS AND IT'S ABOUT

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.969
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE GET

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:41.737
PROPER HEALTH CARE AND THAT

01:05:41.804 --> 01:05:43.673
WHEN WE ARE INVESTING IN

01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:45.574
EDUCATION THAT INCLUDES

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:47.643
EDUCATION THAT KEEPS PEOPLE OUT

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:48.210
OF PRISON AND HELPS PEOPLE

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:49.979
IMPRISONED. SUCCEED WHEN THEY

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:53.783
COME OUT SO I THINK IT'S THE

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:54.417
SUPPORT FOR SHIFTING AMONG THE

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:57.620
PUBLIC OF SHIFTING FUNDING TO

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:59.588
EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE

01:05:59.655 --> 01:06:01.590
INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES IS

01:06:01.657 --> 01:06:02.158
THERE AND WE NEED TO DO A

01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:05.961
BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING THAT'S

01:06:06.028 --> 01:06:09.699
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING. WOULD

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:13.836
YOU SAY. NUMBER I WAS GONNA SAY

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:15.905
REHABILITATION DOES EQUATE TO

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:16.539
PUBLIC SAFETY NEW GIVE SOMEBODY

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:17.707
A SKILL THEY DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:18.274
AND THE ACTUAL CHANCE TO

01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:19.909
SUCCEED AS MATT TALKED ABOUT

01:06:19.975 --> 01:06:23.713
OUR COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAMS.

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:24.280
THEREFORE NOT TO GET A JOB

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:27.717
RIGHT TO HELP WAS TO HAVE THIS

01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:29.552
KIND OF A SOFT LANDING PLACE

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:31.587
WHILE THE FIGURE OUT THEIR NEXT

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.556
STEP SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY

01:06:33.622 --> 01:06:35.624
WHEN YOU CAN PRO ROLE WITH TEN

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:37.760
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN IN YOUR

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.628
POCKET TO WHERE YOU CAN BUY A

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:40.229
CAR. RENDON APARTMENT YOU HAVE

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:45.735
A GREATER CHANCE OF SUCCESS.

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:46.369
OUR PART OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T TWO

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:48.204
SENTENCES. BUT WE HAVE A GREAT

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:51.707
SENSE REFORM AS AN AGENCY AND

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:53.476
I'VE BEEN WITH THIS AGENCY

01:06:53.542 --> 01:06:54.076
LONGER THAN I HEAR TALK ABOUT

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:56.112
ABOUT THIRTY TWO PLUS YEARS AND

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:59.682
I BELIEVE IN THE EVOLUTION THAT

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:01.884
WE'VE GONE THROUGH THAT IT'S

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:05.721
TIME. YOU DON'T HAVE IN OUR

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:06.255
POPULATION I REMEMBER OUR

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:07.957
POPULATION HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR

01:07:08.023 --> 01:07:09.792
THOUSAND IT WAS NOT FUN WORKING

01:07:09.859 --> 01:07:11.594
INSIDE THE INSTITUTIONS AT A

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:12.094
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:15.631
THOUSAND. FOR ANYBODY. AND SO

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.767
SEEN THAT THAT SHIFT AND SO WE

01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:19.602
HAVE A ROLE IN THAT. AND TO

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:21.837
PREPARE EVERYONE FOR RELEASE

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.806
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE A ROLE

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.941
AND I YOU KNOW I SHARE WITH

01:07:26.008 --> 01:07:27.910
GUYS AND GET IT A CHANCE OF A

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:29.612
LIFETIME WHETHER THEY WERE.

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:30.179
HUNDRED EIGHTY YEARS TO LIFE

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:32.047
AND THEY GOT. A RECALL OF

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:34.083
SATINS WHAT A GIFT THAT WAS YOU

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:35.718
HAVE TO BE AN AMBASSADOR OF

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:37.586
THAT. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:07:37.653 --> 01:07:39.588
THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL SO THAT.

01:07:39.655 --> 01:07:41.724
PEOPLE WILL SOFTEN UP TO

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:42.291
FURTHER REFORMS AS THEY COME

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:47.630
DOWN. I GUESS THE RUNNING I

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:48.264
WOULD ADD TO THAT IS THAT PART

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:49.932
OF THE PROBLEM WITH OUR CURRENT

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:50.433
SYSTEM IS THAT IF YOU'RE

01:07:50.499 --> 01:07:51.967
CONVICTED IN LOS ANGELES DURING

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:53.803
THE BAY AREA YOU'RE NOT SENT

01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:55.805
TO. A LOS ANGELES OR BAY AREA

01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:57.640
FACILITY YOU YOU'RE LIKELY TO

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:59.608
BE SENT TO WASCO OR IT CENTRAL

01:07:59.675 --> 01:08:01.844
VALLEY OR- TO LASSEN COUNTY OR

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.879
TO PELICAN BAY. AND I THINK TO

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:06.015
WIN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:07.817
PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO OFFENDERS

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:08.417
HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THEIR

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:11.587
COMMUNITIES. AND SO THAT MEANS

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:13.722
TAKING. TRYING TO KEEP MORE

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:15.691
OFFENDERS LOCAL. AND THEN WHEN

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:16.292
THEY NEVER LEAVE OUR COMMUNITY

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:17.927
BEGIN WITH. OR IT MEANS

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:19.862
RETURNING THEM BACK TO THEIR

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.630
COMMUNITIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:23.666
SO THAT THEY CAN BE. SUPPORTED

01:08:23.732 --> 01:08:25.568
BY THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS BY

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:26.068
THEIR FRIENDS BY THEIR

01:08:26.135 --> 01:08:27.937
COMMUNITIES AND THAT THAT'S

01:08:28.003 --> 01:08:29.772
WHERE THE HEARTS AND MINDS ARE

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:31.707
AND SO AGAIN. WHETHER IT'S

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:32.341
THROUGH RE ENTRY WHETHER IT'S

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:33.709
THROUGH DISH NO PROBATION

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:37.646
SERVICES KEEPING. CRIMINAL

01:08:37.713 --> 01:08:38.280
JUSTICE LOCAL IS THE KEY TO THE

01:08:38.347 --> 01:08:38.848
HEARTS AND MINDS ARGUMENT I

01:08:38.914 --> 01:08:45.621
THINK. JUST VERY QUICKLY TO

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:47.890
SECRETARY QUE KIND OF WHAT YOU

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:48.557
ADVOCATED FOR IS THIS EXPANSION

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:49.625
OF THE MAIL COMMUNITY REENTRY

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:51.694
PROGRAM IN THE CUSTODY TO

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:52.294
COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL YET YOU

01:08:52.361 --> 01:08:54.463
PROGRAM. ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:57.800
HOW DO YOU SCALE THAT YOU HAD A

01:08:57.867 --> 01:08:59.768
TIME WHERE WE ARE HAVING

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:01.804
DIFFICULTY BUILDING HOUSING

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:03.906
EXPANDING THAT FOOTPRINT HOW

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:07.476
HOW COULD WE ACTUALLY SCALE IT

01:09:07.543 --> 01:09:09.311
TO GET TO THE KINDS OF NUMBERS

01:09:09.378 --> 01:09:11.914
THAT WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE IT

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:12.515
MORE EFFECTIVE. THAN THE TENS

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:15.918
OF THOUSANDS. WELL I THINK IS

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:17.953
DO IT AND SO THERE'S NO REASON

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.688
WE CAN'T GO FROM A THOUSAND TO

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:21.857
TWO THOUSAND. RIGHT THAT'S JUST

01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:23.826
ONE LITTLE STEP. AND THEN IF

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:25.861
YOU PUT THAT BUT THAT OUT TO

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:27.863
BID YOU LET THOSE THOSE

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.865
NONPROFITS AND OTHERS CAN AND

01:09:29.932 --> 01:09:33.502
COMPETE. AND YOU GO COMMUNITY

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:34.103
BY COMMUNITY AND YOU JUST DO

01:09:34.169 --> 01:09:35.804
YOUR BEST A LITTLE AT A TIME

01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:37.740
THE PRISON SYSTEM DIDN'T YOU

01:09:37.806 --> 01:09:38.307
KNOW GROW TO WHERE IT IS

01:09:38.374 --> 01:09:39.975
OVERNIGHT EITHER. AND SO THE

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:41.877
SOLUTION SHOULDN'T BE SEEN AS A

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:43.612
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO HAPPEN I

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:45.814
MEAN WE GO FROM A THOUSAND TO

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:46.415
TWO THOUSAND HAVE A FIVE YEAR

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:49.652
PLAN. TO CLOSE ONE PRISON.

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:50.286
RIGHT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING I

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:53.522
THINK YOU CAN ALL BE PROUD OF.

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:55.724
GOOD YOU HAD MENTIONED I THINK

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.793
YOU'RE DECLARE WHAT THE

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.495
POLITICAL RISK OF IF YOU HAD

01:09:59.562 --> 01:10:01.797
JUST ONE PERSON. RE OFFEND THAT

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.766
HAPPEN TO BE IN THIS.

01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:05.601
PARTICULAR PROGRAM SO HOW DO

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:08.070
YOU. HOW DO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:13.709
SORT OF. TRY TO PREVENT THAT

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:14.243
GREAT THING ABOUT BEING A

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:15.844
LAWMAKERS THAT YOU CAN MAKE A

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:21.817
LAW. AND SO. IT IS ALSO IF

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.686
YOU'RE THE SECRETARY OF

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:24.286
CORRECTIONS YOU ALSO HAVE THE

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:27.823
ABILITY TO MAKE REGULATION. TO

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.059
THE GOVERNOR IN SO WHAT I WOULD

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:31.727
DO IS CONSIDER SOMETHING LIKE A

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:35.831
PROGRAM WHERE WE YOUR RELEASED

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:37.800
IT'S A CONDITIONAL RELEASE. AND

01:10:37.866 --> 01:10:39.802
SO YOU'RE NOT AN ENEMY. STILL

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:41.670
IN ONE OF THESE NCRP PROGRAMS

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:43.672
YOU'RE NOW A POORLY OR YOUR

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:45.741
CONDITIONALLY RELEASED. FOR

01:10:45.808 --> 01:10:47.943
EARLY AND SO IF YOU IF YOU MESS

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:49.778
UP YEAH YOU CAN GO BACK TO

HUMAN BEINGS CAN BE DEALT WITH

THROUGH AN APPROPRIATE SANCTION

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.275
APPROPRIATE TREATMENT BASED ON

01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:33.922
JUST TOO MUCH POLITICAL RISK

01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:37.960
YOU DON'T NEED. TO DO SOMETHING

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:49.605
ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU. THAT

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:52.107
PROGRESSIVE DISTRICT OF SAN

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:53.709
FRANCISCO THE PEOPLE WHO SHOW

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:55.678
UP. ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:57.846
PROPERTY CRIMES IN THE AUTO

01:11:57.913 --> 01:11:58.447
BURGLARIES AND THEY NEVER SAY

01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:01.617

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:03.519
THE NEVER THANK AND PROP 47-57

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:04.119
THEY'RE THEY'RE ASKING THEIR

01:12:04.186 --> 01:12:06.021
COSTLY ASKING FOR ENHANCEMENT

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:06.588
NOW THEY ARE. THEY ARE THE

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:11.960
MINORITY HOW DO YOU CREATE THE-

01:12:12.027 --> 01:12:12.528
PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT TECHNICAL

01:12:12.594 --> 01:12:13.662
WORK WITH THE PUBLIC SENTIMENT

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:14.229
IS BECAUSE I DO AGREE THAT

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:15.864
THINK THAT. THE PUBLIC OVERALL

01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:17.933
IS WHAT YOU DESCRIBE BUT

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.768
THEY'RE NOT THE FOLKS THAT SHOW

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:21.970
UP. TO ALL OF OUR MEETINGS ALL

01:12:22.037 --> 01:12:23.706
OVER TOWN HOMES ARE NOT THE

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:25.607
ONES WHO ARE. BEING BEING

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:29.645
FRANKLY VOCAL OR PARTICIPATORY.

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:30.279
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT YOU

01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:33.782
ARE USING ON. THE BACK. I THINK

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:35.884
IT'S REALLY. WHY THE TWO IDEAS

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:36.518
I TALK ABOUT THE BEST HAND IN

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:37.653
HAND WHY IT'S REALLY REALLY I

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.621
THINK IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:40.122
HOMELESSNESS AND CHRONIC

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:41.857
HOMELESSNESS AMONG THE

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:43.826
COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:12:43.892 --> 01:12:44.426
CYCLING THROUGH OUR CRIMINAL

01:12:44.493 --> 01:12:45.828
JUSTICE SYSTEM ON A DAILY BASIS

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:49.698
I THINK WE HAVE TO BE HONEST AT

01:12:49.765 --> 01:12:51.633
THAT IS A REALITY AND WE HAVE

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.669
TO BE CREATIVE ABOUT PROVIDING

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:54.236
THE RESOURCES TO HELP THOSE

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:56.105
PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW THE FOLKS

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:57.840
IN MY COMMUNITY I LIVE IN

01:12:57.906 --> 01:12:59.808
SACRAMENTO. AND MY NEIGHBORS

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.643

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:02.244
LOOK AT THEM AND SAY WHAT ARE

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:03.679
YOU TALKING ABOUT WE LIVE IN A

01:13:03.746 --> 01:13:05.848
GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT THEY

SEE THEY CHOOSE TO FOCUS ON

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:09.818
WHAT. THAT'S THAT'S THEM AND

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:10.419
THEY ARE GIVEN MESSAGES VERY

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:11.653
INTENTIONALLY BY LAW

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.689
ENFORCEMENT THAT THIS IS

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:15.791
BECAUSE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN

01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:17.626
RIGHT THIS IS NOT AN ACCIDENTAL

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:19.661
ASSOCIATION THAT MY NEIGHBORS

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:21.630
HAVE COME UP WITH BY THEMSELVES

01:13:21.697 --> 01:13:23.832
RIGHT THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:24.366
OFFICIAL WHO CAME TO THE

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:26.068
NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION SAID

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:27.970
YEAH THE PROBLEM IS PROP FORTY

01:13:28.036 --> 01:13:31.607
SEVEN GAVE THEM ALL THE TALKING

01:13:31.673 --> 01:13:32.207
POINTS. SO WE NEED TO RESPOND

01:13:32.274 --> 01:13:35.744
TO THAT AND SAY. CRISIS OF

01:13:35.811 --> 01:13:37.746
HOMELESSNESS OF PEOPLE HUMAN

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:38.347
BEINGS WHO DON'T HAVE A PLACE

01:13:38.413 --> 01:13:38.981
TO SLEEP AND CYCLING IN AND OUT

01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:39.782
OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:41.917
IS REAL. AND WE WANT TO BE PART

01:13:41.984 --> 01:13:43.519
OF THE SOLUTION TO ADDRESS

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:45.754
THAT. AND I BELIEVE IT'S REALLY

01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:47.723
ONE OF THE BEST AND LEAST USED

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:49.892
RESOURCES IF THE PUBLIC

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:51.760
DEFENDER'S OFFICE IN THE

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:52.394
CONTACT THEIR MAKING EVERY DAY.

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:52.995
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED

01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:57.866
HELP. BUT WE I THINK WE'VE

01:13:57.933 --> 01:13:58.433
HEARD A LOT IN AND THANK YOU

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.169
ALL VERY MUCH FOR IT. JUST WANT

01:14:00.235 --> 01:14:03.839
TO SAY AS AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:04.473
MENTIONED PROBABLY THERE'S NOT

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.774
AN ISSUE THAT HASN'T BEEN

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:07.843
RAISED TODAY THAT. MANY OF US

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.511
HAVE NOT TRIED TO DO. AND SO I

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:11.680
WANT TO MAKE THAT THE PUBLIC NO

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:12.247
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THAT THE

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:13.649
FOLKS AT THE PIER OF. DON'T

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:15.684
WANT TO DO THAT THESE ARE THE

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:17.553
THESE ARE THE WARRIORS WHO DO

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:19.788
IT. AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:20.322
SURE THAT'S CLEAR BECAUSE

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:21.990
OFTENTIMES WE DO AND WE'VE DONE

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:23.826
SOME THINGS RELATED TO IT. I

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:25.427
THINK YOU'VE SEEN MOST WERE

01:14:25.494 --> 01:14:25.961
RECENTLY THE A WE'VE BEEN

01:14:26.028 --> 01:14:28.030
LIMITED THE ENHANCEMENTS SOME

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:29.698
OF THE ENHANCEMENTS SO THAT WAS

01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:31.433
IMPORTANT. TERMS OF REDUCING

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.635
THAT AS WELL AS CHANGING THE

01:14:33.702 --> 01:14:34.236
THIS THE DEFINITION OF CRACK

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:37.706
COCAINE. OF SO THAT IT'S NOT

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:38.273
THE UP HEAVY HAVE BEEN THE

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.975
THING AS IT WAS BEFORE. IN THE

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:41.777
END AND BASICALLY TREATING IT

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:43.645
AS COCAINE. WHICH WOULD HAVE

01:14:43.712 --> 01:14:44.279
BEEN HELPFUL WITH AN AWFUL LOT

01:14:44.346 --> 01:14:45.881
OF INDIVIDUALS WHO BEEN

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:47.816
INCARCERATED. AND OUT AND WE'VE

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:49.451
BEEN ADVOCATING FOR SENTENCING

01:14:49.518 --> 01:14:51.553
REFORM. AND THAT'S A HARD THING

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:53.555
TO DO AND WE AND WHILE WE HAVE

01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:55.557
ADVOCATES AND SUPPORTERS AT CDC

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:57.826
ARE SOME OF THEM. WE ALSO HAVE

01:14:57.893 --> 01:14:59.595
TO DO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:00.062
POWERFUL LOBBY OF LAW

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:01.897
ENFORCEMENT AND I KNOW THAT

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:03.665
FROM THREE NINE TWO. THE

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:04.132
POWERFUL LOBBY OF LAW

01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:06.101
ENFORCEMENT WHICH ALSO SAYS

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:07.736
THEY DID NOT AS POWERFUL AS IT

01:15:07.803 --> 01:15:09.938
USED TO BE. SO WE KNOW THAT WE

01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:11.707
CAN BE DONE BUT IT REQUIRES A

01:15:11.773 --> 01:15:12.307
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PUBLIC

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:15.444
SUPPORT. FOR THIS TO HAPPEN AND

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:16.144
I THINK WE PASS LAWS THAT THAT

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:18.013
LET US KNOW PEOPLE. OF WANT TO

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.915
THINK ABOUT THAT IF YOU PUT IT

01:15:19.982 --> 01:15:20.549
OUT THERE LIKE THAT BUT THEN

01:15:20.616 --> 01:15:21.884
WHAT HAPPENS AS YOU POINT OUT.

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:23.819
THE FIRST TIME SOMETHING

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:25.454
HAPPENS PEOPLE BLAME IT ON BOTH

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.088
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW. AND AS A

01:15:26.154 --> 01:15:27.923
RESULT WE FIND OURSELVES

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.457
BATTLING TO MAKE SURE THE

01:15:28.523 --> 01:15:29.958
PROPERTY SEVEN PROP WITH. THIS

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:31.894
NUMBER THAT NUMBER BASICALLY

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.795
SURVIVE SO WE'VE GOT A

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:35.631
TREMENDOUS TASK HERE BUT I

01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:36.265
THINK WE'RE WE'RE COMMITTED TO.

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:42.004
OF THE. ONE THING WE HAVE DONE

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.571
IN THE LEGISLATURE'S WE HAVE

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:47.509
COMMITTED OURSELVES. TO

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:48.143
REHABILITATION. WHEN I CHANGE

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:49.912
THE DEFINITION OF SENTENCING.

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:51.680
WE WANTED TO PUT. SOMETHING FOR

01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:52.080
PUBLIC SAFETY AND

01:15:52.147 --> 01:15:53.548
REHABILITATION. WE COULDN'T GET

01:15:53.615 --> 01:15:54.149
AWAY WITH THOSE TWO WORDS WE

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:55.617
HAD PUT PUNISHMENT IN IT.

01:15:55.684 --> 01:15:56.251
THERE'S PEOPLE LIKE PUNISHMENT.

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:57.886
EVEN THOSE BEING IN PRISON IS A

01:15:57.953 --> 01:15:59.755
PUNISHMENT BY ITSELF. BUT WE

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:01.857
COULD NOT GET THAT BILL PASSED

01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:03.759
WITHOUT PUNISHMENT THROWN IN

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:05.527
THE MIDDLE OF IT. SO WE DID

01:16:05.594 --> 01:16:06.094
CHANGE IT FROM THE PUBLIC

01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:08.030
SAFETY AND REHABILITATION BUT

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:09.464
PUNISHMENT IS STILL THERE.

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:10.065
BECAUSE THAT'S THE MENTALITY.

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:12.034
OF FOLKS WITH REGARDS TO.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.702
PUBLIC SAFETY. SO WE STILL

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:15.804
BATTLING THESE ISSUES A VERY

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:17.539
GOOD. DISCUSSION THANK YOU ALL

WE'RE LOOKING AT. AND AS WE

01:16:23.578 --> 01:16:25.714
BEGIN TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN.

01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:26.181
CONTINUE TO REDUCE THE

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:27.749
POPULATION AND REDUCE.

01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:28.817
RECIDIVISM AT THE SAME TIME

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:37.759
THIS OBVIOUSLY. BECOMES A MAJOR

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:38.327
PIECE OF IT SO THANK YOU SO

THERE'S A QUESTION TO BE ASKED.

01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:01.850
THINK ABOUT IT AS A QUESTION

SOMETHING LIKE AUTO MECHANICS

01:19:03.638 --> 01:19:05.707
TO WALK OUTSIDE AND SAY THERE'S

01:19:05.774 --> 01:19:09.678

LATER ALL WITH TECHNOLOGY HAS

01:19:19.721 --> 01:19:21.890
BEEN MAJOR STRUGGLE FOR THE

01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:25.627
DEPARTMENT THAT SOMETHING WITTY

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:31.800

MOTIVATE ME EVERY DAY TO COME

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.588
BACK TO WORK BECAUSE OF WHAT

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:55.690
THEY'RE TRYING TO DO. IN A

01:19:55.757 --> 01:19:56.291
SYSTEM THAT WE'VE HEARD. IS

01:19:56.358 --> 01:19:57.626
VERY DIFFICULT TO DO IT WE ARE

01:19:57.692 --> 01:19:59.928
A SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE

01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:01.696
AND WE ARE PUSHING OUR WAY AND

01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:03.565
BECAUSE REHABILITATION IS SO

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:05.567
IMPORTANT. AND SO I CAN'T GIVE

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:07.569
ENOUGH CREDIT TO THE PEOPLE

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:08.103

TO COME IN AND CONTINUE DOING

01:20:11.907 --> 01:20:13.842

I FEEL LIKE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:20:19.848 --> 01:20:20.448
RE ENTERING WHAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:20:20.515 --> 01:20:22.117

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:31.893
ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.728
NEED. AND SO THEY MIGHT NEED AN

01:20:33.795 --> 01:20:35.897
EDUCATION OR THEY MIGHT NEED TO

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:36.498
CAREER TECHNICAL TRADE. THEY

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:37.866
ALSO NEED TIME IN THE EVENING

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:39.734
TO ENJOY OTHER PEOPLE'S COMPANY

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.870

BLOOD PRESSURE IS THROUGH THE

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:55.984
ROOF. AND SO I DIDN'T STOP

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:57.786

BEFORE THESE AND IN ADDITION

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:18.353
SOME METRICS ARE MISLEADING FOR

BEING SHUT DOWN DUE TO A LACK

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:07.836

EFFECTIVE. THE LEGISLATURE

01:25:23.852 --> 01:25:25.687

PROGRAMS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:30.225
THAT THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE

01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:31.659

STRUGGLING DATE AND

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:04.252
UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS

HAPPENING WHAT AT THE LOCAL

01:32:05.953 --> 01:32:06.520
LEVEL AND THAT IS A LOT OF THE

01:32:06.587 --> 01:32:09.557
IN IT. THAT WE PUT IN PLACE A

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:11.559
COUPLE YEARS SO I'M A QUICKLY

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:12.193
JUST GO THROUGH BALL BY BALL IT

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:13.761
IF THAT'S OKAY PLEASE SO.

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:14.328
REQUIRE PROGRAMS WE HAVE IN

01:32:14.395 --> 01:32:15.663
SPACE SO WE'VE ALWAYS HAD THE

01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:16.297
REQUIREMENT THAT ARE TREATMENT

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:17.698
PROGRAMS ACADEMIC EDUCATION AND

01:32:17.765 --> 01:32:18.299
CAREER TECHNICAL PROGRAMS BE

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:18.866
EVIDENCE BASED WHEN WE FIRST

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:19.734
STARTED COLLECTING EVIDENCE

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:21.869
BASED INFORMATION WE WERE

01:32:21.936 --> 01:32:22.436
COLLECTING EVERYTHING THAT

01:32:22.503 --> 01:32:24.005
PEOPLE WERE USING AND NOT JUST

01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:25.940
THE PRIMARY CURRICULUMS ARE

01:32:26.007 --> 01:32:26.374
SECONDARY CREEK AND

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.875
UNDERSTANDING HOW THINGS WERE

01:32:27.942 --> 01:32:30.011
LAYER. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE

01:32:30.077 --> 01:32:31.746
DID WORK WITH A FEW RESULTS

01:32:31.812 --> 01:32:33.948
FIRST AND IN THAT IN THAT WORK

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:35.816
WHEN WE CAME OUT WE WANT TO

01:32:35.883 --> 01:32:36.350
PUBLISH IT WE WANT TO BE

01:32:36.417 --> 01:32:38.085
TRANSPARENT I DID A COLLECTION

01:32:38.152 --> 01:32:39.887
ABOUT 7275% WERE. NOTED AS NOT

01:32:39.954 --> 01:32:41.923
BEING EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULUM

01:32:41.989 --> 01:32:43.824
NOT THAT IT WAS FOUND TO BE

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:45.693
NEGATIVE JUST THAT IT WASN'T IN

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.260
THE RESULTS FIRST CLEARING

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:47.795
HOUSE OR HAD NOT BEEN

01:32:47.862 --> 01:32:48.362
RESEARCHED. SO WE THOUGHT

01:32:48.429 --> 01:32:49.630
WHAT'S OUR FIRST INITIATIVE IS

01:32:49.697 --> 01:32:51.866
TAKE IT REALLY KIND OF MAKE

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:52.500
SURE THAT ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS

01:32:52.566 --> 01:32:53.801
EVIDENCE BASED SO WE'VE PUT OUT

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:54.335
POLICY WITH ARE IN PRISON

01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:57.805
PROGRAMS EVEN AS OF RECENTLY

01:32:57.872 --> 01:32:59.874
FORCING THEM TO USE CURRICULUM

01:32:59.941 --> 01:33:01.575
IS WITHIN THE RESULTS FIRST

01:33:01.642 --> 01:33:02.176
CLEARING HOUSE. SO WHEN YOU

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:03.477
LOOK AT OUR PRIMARY CURRICULUM

01:33:03.544 --> 01:33:05.646
FOR IN PRISON PROGRAMS NOW THE

01:33:05.713 --> 01:33:07.648
LAST I CHECKED WAS ABOUT 95%

01:33:07.715 --> 01:33:08.182
WAS USING EVIDENCE BASED

01:33:08.249 --> 01:33:15.589
CURRICULUM IN THE RESULTS FIRST.

01:33:15.656 --> 01:33:16.090
CLEARING HOUSE. AS BEING

01:33:16.157 --> 01:33:19.994
EFFECTIVE. THE SECOND PIECE OF

01:33:20.061 --> 01:33:21.796
THAT IS. WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO

01:33:21.862 --> 01:33:22.430
HARM. PROGRAMS SURROUNDING AT

01:33:22.496 --> 01:33:23.698
ITS BASE THE DISCUSSION IS

01:33:23.764 --> 01:33:24.298
REALLY IMPORTANT. FOR US. IN

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:25.900
SAYING OUR COMMUNITY BASED

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:26.500
ORGANIZATIONS THAT PEOPLE TO

01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:27.101
COME IN THE PRISONS THAT ARE

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:27.868

01:33:27.935 --> 01:33:29.737
ARE DOING THINGS LIKE. YOU KNOW

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:30.171

01:33:31.872 --> 01:33:33.808
FAMILY REUNIFICATION. WE NEED

DATA. BEFORE WE SAY THAT

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:36.344
THEY'RE NOT EFFECTIVE AND SO

01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:37.745
THOSE PROGRAMS. NOT THAT

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:39.613
THEY'RE NOT EVIDENCE BASED. AND

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.281
I DON'T THINK THAT WE FEEL LIKE

01:33:40.348 --> 01:33:41.782
THEY SHOULD GO AWAY THEY

01:33:41.849 --> 01:33:43.617
PROVIDE A REALLY HOLISTIC

01:33:43.684 --> 01:33:44.185
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO

01:33:44.251 --> 01:33:45.653
PARTICIPATE. OTHER THINGS. SO

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.722
THOSE ARE OFF THE SIDE WE HAVE

01:33:47.788 --> 01:33:48.189

01:33:58.165 --> 01:33:59.800
OPPORTUNITIES WHICH I THINK

01:33:59.867 --> 01:34:01.736
WILL BE. AND THE SECOND OVER

01:34:01.802 --> 01:34:02.236
