OF THE CERRO I CERTAINLY HEARD

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:38.410
FROM A LOT OF- COUNTIES EARLY ON

00:19:38.477 --> 00:19:40.445
THAT THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THEY

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:40.979
HAVE THE CAPACITY OR THE

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:45.017

00:19:45.083 --> 00:19:47.185

REALIGNMENTS OR OR WE STILL

00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:04.836
FINDING LIKE THE COUNTIES ON ON

00:20:04.903 --> 00:20:06.638
INLAND HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:09.474
FUNDING THAN THE COUNTIES- IN

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:11.376
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE IS

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:12.878
THAT IS THAT REMAIN A CONSISTENT

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:15.514
ISSUE AROUND THIS AREA AS WELL.

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:18.617
WHAT WE DID HERE THE HOUSE- AND

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:21.153
WE ARE- BUILT INTO THE

00:20:21.219 --> 00:20:23.021
LEGISLATION IS A REVIEW OF THE

00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:25.023

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:29.227
TWENTY FOUR SO WE'RE TAKING NOTE

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:31.330

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:33.398
THINK JUST BY VIRTUE OF.

00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:35.601
DEVELOPING A FORMULA THAT THEY

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:38.170
THERE ARE THOSE THAT DON'T. FEEL

00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:40.639
LIKE THEY HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT

00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:42.741
OF RESOURCES AS AS OTHERS COMING

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:44.276
FROM THE STATE SO WE ARE TAKING

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:47.045
NOTE. AND OUR GOAL IS TO

00:20:47.112 --> 00:20:48.547
AMELIORATE THOSE DISCREPANCIES

00:20:48.614 --> 00:20:50.849
AT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN OUR

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:54.219
NEXT ITERATION AND HOW THAT

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:55.854
FUNDING IS GOING TO BE ROLLED

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.356
OUT. OKAY THAT THAT THAT IS

00:20:57.422 --> 00:21:00.258

PEOPLE HAVE TO APPLY FOR FUNDING

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:12.604
FOR IT'LL JUST BE FROM YOUR

00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:14.806

BEING ABLE TO MEET WITH

00:26:27.385 --> 00:26:28.887
INDIVIDUALS PROVIDE INSIGHTS

00:26:28.954 --> 00:26:30.855
THAT FOCUS- HAVE QUESTIONS

00:26:30.922 --> 00:26:32.691

PRESENTATION THE WORK BEING PUT

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:45.337
IN I GUESS AT THE ONLY QUESTION

00:26:45.403 --> 00:26:47.772
I HAD SO- AND I KNOW THAT WHEN

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:48.640
THE CHALLENGES YOU PRESENTED IN

00:26:48.707 --> 00:26:50.108
TERMS OF PARTICULARLY ARE

00:26:50.175 --> 00:26:50.742
SMALLER COUNTIES IN RURAL

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:53.912
COUNTIES- IS A LACK OF STAFF

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:56.114
ALSO I THINK YOU KNOW DISTANCE

00:26:56.181 --> 00:26:58.416
IS AN ISSUE OR GEOGRAPHY-

00:26:58.483 --> 00:26:59.751
BECAUSE FOR THE PROGRAM IS TO

00:26:59.818 --> 00:27:01.386
TRY TO BRING THESE EVEN OUT

00:27:01.453 --> 00:27:03.455
CLOSER TO HOME RIGHT SO THAT

00:27:03.521 --> 00:27:04.789
THERE AND- SO THAT THEY WOULD

00:27:04.856 --> 00:27:05.690
HAVE THAT SUPPORTS BUT- WHEN

00:27:05.757 --> 00:27:07.292
YOU'RE DISPERSED GEOGRAPHICALLY.

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:08.393
THAT'S CHALLENGING AS WELL

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.861
COMBINED WITH THE SAID LACK OF

00:27:09.928 --> 00:27:14.699
STAFF- IT'S ADDRESS- IT AND THEN

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:17.302
CERTAINLY IT CAN STAND YOU DOING

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:18.269
SOME OF THESE REGIONAL CENTERS

00:27:18.336 --> 00:27:20.038
AS WELL BUT THAT. A SO ARE. WHAT

00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:21.740
KIND OF PROTEGER TAKING THAT TO

00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:23.575
TRY TO CRACK THAT NOT GREAT

00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:25.377
BECAUSE IN SOME SENSES CREATING

00:27:25.443 --> 00:27:27.445
A REGIONAL APPROACH IS NOW MAKES

00:27:27.512 --> 00:27:29.881
SENSE BECAUSE- I TRY TO PULL

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:30.949
RESOURCES BUT ALSO. YOU'RE

00:27:31.016 --> 00:27:32.017
FIGHTING AGAINST THE GEOGRAPHY

00:27:32.083 --> 00:27:34.185
SO HOW DO YOU KEEP THE YOU SO

00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:36.154
HI. WHAT'S ON THE THOUGHTS ABOUT

00:27:36.221 --> 00:27:37.856
WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THE

00:27:37.922 --> 00:27:38.890
PARTICULARLY THE SMALLER RURAL

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:41.760
COUNTIES IN TERMS OF. TRYING TO

00:27:41.826 --> 00:27:43.628
KEEP. THE SKIP CLOSER TO THEIR

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:47.098
HOMES RIGHT- TRYING TO FIGURE

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:49.601
OUT HOW YEAH AND YET THE SAME

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:50.635
TIME- THEY'LL BE SURE YOU CAN

00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:52.203
PUT THE RESOURCES TOGETHER TO

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.938
PROVIDE THE SUPPORT AND OF

00:27:54.005 --> 00:27:55.340
COURSE THEY THEY MIGHT YOU KNOW

00:27:55.407 --> 00:27:56.708
THEIR HOMES MIGHT BE DISPERSED

00:27:56.775 --> 00:27:57.776
ACROSS A LARGE GEOGRAPHIC AREA

00:27:57.842 --> 00:27:59.811
DEPENDING ON THE KIDS AND SO

00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:02.514
FORTH. SO- I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.482
WHAT KIND OF PURCHASED- YOU'RE

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:06.851
FIGURING OUT ON THAT WITH THE

00:28:06.918 --> 00:28:10.155
COUNTIES. WELL I THINK THAT LIKE

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.325
GORDIAN KNOT THAT WE HAVE TO

00:28:14.392 --> 00:28:16.694
UNRAVEL AND- I THINK ONE OF THE

00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:18.696
THINGS THAT WE CAN HAVE LEARNED

00:28:18.763 --> 00:28:20.565
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS

00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:22.767
THAT. THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:24.436
FOR TREATMENT WITH TELE THREE

00:28:24.502 --> 00:28:26.838
MEN TELEHEALTH. OUR LOOKING AT

00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:28.573

CYCLE. AND THIS CAUSES

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.489
DEPARTMENTS TO CONSISTENTLY HAVE

TO HAVE PARALLEL OPERATIONS

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:02.693
ACROSS MULTIPLE DISASTERS. SO

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.495
WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS IS THAT

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:06.997
THE ONSET OF A DISASTER ITS

FOR ANOTHER MAJOR FIRE SCENES

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:33.524
AND WHILE OF COURSE. WE HAVE

00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:35.459
MORE DEFINED GEOGRAPHIC

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:36.927

SIGNIFICANT HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:41:47.204 --> 00:41:48.939
SERVICES PROGRAMS AS YOU ALL

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:51.876

00:41:51.942 --> 00:41:54.979
REQUIRES ALL THE STAFF THAT

00:41:55.045 --> 00:41:55.746
CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:41:55.813 --> 00:41:57.681
SERVICES AGENCY OVERSEES FULL

PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:03.320
WHEN A DISASTER WORK FOR THE

OF A FIRE OR SEASON OR SOMETHING

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:23.707
THAT WAS OF SIGNIFICANT COST. SO

00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:25.509
THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE WHICH

00:42:25.576 --> 00:42:27.144

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:13.430
DEPARTMENTS YOU REALLY DON'T

HAVE THE SKILLS AND HOUSE AND

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.068

THAT WE INCUR MORE RISK AND IT

00:52:45.228 --> 00:52:48.198

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:49.518
A PILOT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:53.788
THAT- AS AS AGAIN DRUG DURING

EARLIER PRESENTATIONS

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:03.598
REPRESENTATION. MATTERS WE WANT

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:05.433
TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE'RE

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:08.069
CHOOSING TREATMENT CENTERS THAT

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:10.305
REFLECT VARIED EXPERIENCE

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:13.575
WHETHER THAT BE- INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:17.045
ARE- POPULATIONS THAT THAT HAVE

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:18.780
BEEN HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED.

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:24.553

01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:57.238
THIS NOVEL- PILOT TO DETERMINE

01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:59.007
WHETHER IT'S- WHETHER IT'S A

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:00.809
SUCCESSFUL MODEL THAT AND WHEN

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.644
THE COULD BE SORT OF REPLICATED

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:05.280
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE- IN

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:06.715
THE CONVERSATIONS THE DEPARTMENT

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:08.650
INDICATED. TO US THAT IT IS

01:23:08.717 --> 01:23:10.452
THINKING ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:13.021

EVALUATION AND SO THERE IS

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:21.396
CONSEQUENTLY NO WAY TO GUARANTEE

01:23:21.463 --> 01:23:24.833
THAT ONE WOULD BE CONDUCTED. AND

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:25.800

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.235
TREATMENT. TYPICALLY DOESN'T

PART OF THAT EVALUATION. YEAH I

01:26:44.432 --> 01:26:45.800

LOOK ACROSS THE SPECTRUM MET

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:49.404

WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT IN

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.499
RETURNING THIS PROJECT THE IDEA

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:20.602
OF LOOKING AT THE WHOLE PERSON.

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:22.837

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:25.273

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:26.741
BELIEVE THIS WILL CHANGE THE

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:29.677
TRAJECTORY FROM THAT FOR THEM IN

01:27:29.744 --> 01:27:32.080

01:27:32.146 --> 01:27:34.716
IMPORTANT POINTS. IT'S JUST A

01:27:34.782 --> 01:27:36.718
REALLY I THINK A KEY THING TO BE

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:38.386
TAKING ACTUALLY TWO PEOPLE IN

01:27:38.453 --> 01:27:44.425

THE AVAIL. OF TREATMENT CENTERS

01:27:47.662 --> 01:27:49.397
AND SOME OF OUR MORE RURAL AREAS

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:50.865
THAT WE KNOW HAVE BEEN HARDEST

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:52.367

START WITH TO IN BED- SOMEBODY

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:57.171
FROM THE DEPARTMENT IN THERE SO

01:27:57.238 --> 01:27:58.539
I THINK THOSE THINGS WILL NEED

01:27:58.606 --> 01:28:00.441

01:28:00.508 --> 01:28:02.010
