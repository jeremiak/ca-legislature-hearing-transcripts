00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:39.491
IMPORTANT. I DIDN'T QUITE GET

00:22:47.065 --> 00:22:50.802
THAT WERE HURT- IN THE- DURING

00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:52.904
THE PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY. AND

00:22:52.971 --> 00:22:54.473

REASON I SAY I ASK THIS

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:16.194
QUESTION IS BECAUSE I'VE SEEN

PROGRAMS. BUT REALLY THERE'S NO

00:23:35.881 --> 00:23:37.749
FINAL CONNECTION TO A JOB THEY

00:23:37.816 --> 00:23:40.986
GET SOME- GETS THEM TO WORK SO

00:23:41.052 --> 00:23:43.455

THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE GIVING TO

00:31:30.455 --> 00:31:32.090
THE CLAIMANTS- BECAUSE I THINK

00:31:32.156 --> 00:31:34.792
OTHERWISE. IT'S UP TO A LOT OF

00:31:34.859 --> 00:31:35.426

PROPOSALS TO MAKE CHANGES IN

00:31:43.134 --> 00:31:45.937
THE LABOR AGENCY. AS FAR AS A

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:48.339
FOCUS ON THOSE SERVICES LIKE

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:52.110
EDIE D. LIKE LEAVES- LIKE

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:53.745
DISABILITY THOSE ARE REALLY

00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:56.414
SPECIFIC. BENEFITS THAT I THINK

00:31:56.481 --> 00:31:58.449
ARE REALLY DIFFERENT FROM. THE

00:31:58.516 --> 00:32:00.752
WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT AND

00:32:00.818 --> 00:32:01.919
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE DONE AND

00:32:01.986 --> 00:32:03.921
THE LABOR AGENCY BUT I THINK

00:32:03.988 --> 00:32:06.491
WITH YOUR BILL. THEY'LL BE THAT

00:32:06.557 --> 00:32:08.126
FOCUS THAT'S NEEDED AND I HOPE

00:32:08.192 --> 00:32:09.794
THAT WE CAN MAKE EVEN BIGGER

00:32:09.861 --> 00:32:13.164
DEEPER CHANGES IN THE LABOR

00:32:13.231 --> 00:32:14.866

ASSEMBLY MEMBER I JUST

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:19.537
APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR AS I

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:20.805
KNOW THAT'S A CONCERN OF YOURS

00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:22.006

00:32:22.073 --> 00:32:23.541
END OF THE DAY WE WANT TO MAKE

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:25.576
SURE THAT WE ARE- PROVIDING

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:27.378
SERVICE FOR CONSTITUENTS. AND

00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:28.079
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE

00:32:28.146 --> 00:32:29.514
CLAIMANTS EXPERIENCE AND WHAT

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.548
THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND WHAT

00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:31.582
THEY'RE LIVING IN THEIR DAY TO

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:33.184
DAY LIFE. WHEN THEY ARE TRYING

TO ACCESS THESE RESOURCES AND

00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:35.920
SO I THINK ALL GOVERNMENT

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:36.754
AGENCIES TO TAKE THAT INTO

00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:38.189
ACCOUNT WHEN FOLKS ARE TRYING

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:39.624
TO ACCESS GOVERNMENT. AND IT'S

00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:40.725
INCUMBENT UPON US TO MAKE SURE

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:41.559

AUTOMATIC DISCIPLINE AND EVEN

00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:37.141

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:38.910
STANDARD. WHAT'S CONSIDERED

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:40.378
COMPETITIVE AND WHEN THE MOST

00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:42.380
PHYSICALLY DANGEROUS FIELDS

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:43.614
WORK AND THE NUMBERS DON'T LOOK

00:34:43.681 --> 00:34:45.483
GOOD. AMAZON WORKERS ARE

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.718
INJURED ON THE JOB AT. AT TWICE

00:34:47.785 --> 00:34:49.253
THE AVERAGE RATE OF THE OVERALL

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.988

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:52.523
THREE TIMES THE AVERAGE RATE.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.926
ACROSS ALL PRIVATE EMPLOYERS IN

00:34:54.992 --> 00:34:55.827
TWENTY TWENTY AMAZON SERIOUS

00:34:55.893 --> 00:34:57.829
INJURY RATE WAS 80% HIGHER THAN

00:34:57.895 --> 00:34:58.896
THE RATE FOR ALL OTHER

00:34:58.963 --> 00:35:01.666
WAREHOUSING EMPLOYERS. ALMOST

00:35:01.732 --> 00:35:02.900
89% OF THOSE INJURED WORKERS

00:35:02.967 --> 00:35:04.435
HAD TO MISS WORK AND EXPERIENCE

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:05.870
LONGER RECOVERY PERIODS THAN

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:07.705
OTHER WAREHOUSE WORKERS. THESE

00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:09.273
DANGEROUS PRACTICES ARE CAUSING

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.475
AMAZON TO CHURN THROUGH WORKERS

00:35:10.541 --> 00:35:12.243
AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE AND

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:14.312
IT'S SIMPLY UNSUSTAINABLE. THE

00:35:14.378 --> 00:35:15.646
ANNUAL TURNOVER RATE FOR

00:35:15.713 --> 00:35:16.814

UP TO OVER A 100% A YEAR A

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.955
HUNDRED PERCENT. TURNOVER IN AN

INDUSTRY A YEAR. WORKERS HAVE

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.024
REPEATEDLY GOT INJURED ON THE

00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:28.459
JOB BECAUSE THEY WERE FORCED TO

00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:31.529
RUSH THROUGH SAFETY PROTOCOLS

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:32.597
TO TRY AND MEET GREAT. YET MOST.

00:35:32.663 --> 00:35:34.265
STILL CANNOT SPEAK OUT FOR FEAR

00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:35.867
OF LOSING THEIR JOB. WE

00:35:35.933 --> 00:35:37.068
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SPECIFY IN

00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:38.469
LAW THAT WORKERS HAVE THE RIGHT

00:35:38.536 --> 00:35:39.504
TO USE THE BATHROOM INSTEAD OF

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:40.972
URINATING IN. WHEREVER THEY

00:35:41.038 --> 00:35:42.607
CAN'T OR WHEN THEY CAN THAT

00:35:42.673 --> 00:35:43.541
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO WASH THEIR

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:45.142
HANDS AND SANITIZER EQUIPMENT

00:35:45.209 --> 00:35:47.011
DURING A PANDEMIC. WE CAN'T

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:48.513
STAND BY AND ACCEPT THAT THESE

00:35:48.579 --> 00:35:49.780
UNDIGNIFIED AN UNSAFE WORKING

00:35:49.847 --> 00:35:51.082
CONDITIONS ARE THE NEW FUTURE

00:35:51.148 --> 00:35:52.550
WORK IT'S CLEAR THAT A CHANGE

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:35.691
THE LONGEST LIST OF SUPPORTERS

01:01:35.758 --> 01:01:37.727
THAT ANYBODY'S EVER SEEN. ALSO

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.896
TYPICALLY WITH THE LONGEST LIST

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:41.798
OF OPPOSITION- SO I GUESS WE'RE

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:44.133
DOING SOMETHING IMPORTANT HERE

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.702
I DO HAVE A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS.

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:48.738
BUT ON THE AMENDMENT AMENDMENT

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:51.007
NINE IT REFERS TO- PERSONAL

01:01:51.074 --> 01:01:53.342

EVERYBODY. INVOLVED IS THERE AN

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:01.751

PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH ONE-

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.424
WOULD ALL EMPLOYERS INCLUDING

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.959
AMAZON KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS IS

01:02:10.026 --> 01:02:11.527
AN ACCEPTED DEFINITION FOR THAT

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:13.296
I WOULD EXPECT THAT WE'VE NEVER

01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:15.731
ACTUALLY- BEEN ASSET BECAUSE

01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:17.700
THOSE COMPANIES THAT HAVE THAT

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:19.035
DATA. KNOW WHAT IT IS AND THAT

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:20.736

SOMEWHERE HOUSES THAT ARE LIKE.

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:29.245
WE DON'T KNOW THEY GET THE JOB

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:30.613
DONE YET THAT'S NOT WHAT WITH

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.381

BUT I EAN SO. HOW DO WE MAKE

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:38.221
THAT DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:39.989
WHO DO AND THOSE WHO DON'T IF.

01:02:40.056 --> 01:02:40.857

BILL. IN ESSENCE DOESN'T TO

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:50.533
THERE'S A REASON WE CLEAR

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.368
DIVISION HAS TO RELATE TO

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:53.336
ALGORITHMIC TRACKING OF

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:56.072
PRODUCTIVITY. AT FISHER THAT TO

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:56.973
ON ON THE NINETY DAYS IS

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:58.474

THEORETICALLY SUBJECT TO GAMING

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:07.517
LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:09.218
THOUGHTS ON. PREVENTING AN

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:10.319
EMPLOYEEFROM USING THAT

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:11.554
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AS A WAY

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:15.158
OF. STAVING OFF. MANAGEMENT WE

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:16.526
ARE WORKING THROUGH AND I

01:03:16.592 --> 01:03:18.161
ANTICIPATE WILL TAKE- ANOTHER

01:03:18.227 --> 01:03:19.695
SET OF AMENDMENTS COMING OUT

01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:20.963
WE'RE WORKING PACKED WITH THE

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.598
STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:23.833
AS IF THEY SHOULD MOVE THE NEXT

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.368
COMMITTEE. TO TALK ABOUT

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:27.270
LIMITING THAT TO A ONE TIME-

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.605
USE FOR THE PERSONAL DATA- THE

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:30.740
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:31.908
PERSONAL DATA SAID THAT IT

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:33.309

WELL. THAT AND THEN ON TO MY

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:39.949
LEAST FAVORITE- TOPICS PAGA- IT

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:41.250
AGAIN THERE THERE'S A CONCERN

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:43.653
HERE THAT THAT INTRODUCING THE

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:45.721
POCKET ON HERE. MIGHT MIGHT

ACROSS A BUNCH OF SPHERES WHICH

01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:50.993
WHICH MY SPEAKING TO THAT. WELL

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.828
WE DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:54.297
THAT'S TRUE AND THERE'S NOTHING

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:55.932
TO SUGGEST THERE'S NO CASE LAW

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:57.533
TO SUGGEST THAT THAT'S TRUE WE

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.402
ARE LOOKING DEEPER INTO THAT IF

01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:05.841
NECESSARY WE CAN- FURTHER

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:07.510
CLARIFY THE POT. THAT PORTION

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:08.711
OF THIS BILL. ONLY IS. IN THE

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:09.579
BILL WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT SURE-

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:12.281
THAT. COULD USE FOR COUNTY-

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:14.150
COUNTY NECESSARILY LIKE THAT

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:15.918
HAVE THEIR OWN. RULES AND

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:17.954
REGULATIONS- AS FAR AS THE

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:18.588
OTHER THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT

01:04:18.654 --> 01:04:20.289
UP ABOUT PROJECT. I FEEL LIKE

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:21.424
IT'S A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS TO

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:22.358
BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:24.260
CHAMBER. THEY LIKE TO CALL THEM

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:25.328
EVERYTHING IN THIS BILL ABSURD

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:26.862
BUT IT'S ABSURD TO SUGGEST THAT

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:28.331
WERE WERE SAYING THE RIGHT TO

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:30.333
CURE ON PAGA IS ONLY. THE

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:31.000
ELEMENT THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:33.002
ABOUT THAT ONE ON YOU NOT

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:34.837
LOOKING AT TWENTY SIX NINE NINE

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.973
POINT THREE AS A WHOLE. SO

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.241
WE'RE WE'RE WILLING TO CLARIFY

01:04:38.307 --> 01:04:39.041
THAT LANGUAGE AND CONTINUE TO

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:40.776
CLARIFY THAT LANGUAGE. WE PUT

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:42.878
THE SPECIFICALLY PUT IN THAT

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:44.447
THIS IS SUBJECT TO WRITE HERE

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:45.648
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE NOT

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.683
EXPANDING PADA AS FAR AS A

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:50.319
RESULTING IN- I NECESSARY IF

01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:52.121
YOU WELL LITIGATION THAT. FOR

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:53.889
LITIGATION SAKE WE WANT PEOPLE

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:55.591
TO. BE ABLE TO GET THEIR JOB

01:04:55.658 --> 01:04:56.993
BACK IF THEY'VE BEEN FIRED TO

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:58.761
BE ABLE TO- CHANGE THE

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:00.296
CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY ARE

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:02.231
GETTING INJURED- WE'RE NOT

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:05.001
LOOKING TO. JUST PAY PEOPLE

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:06.869
COMPENSATION THERE ARE OTHER

01:05:06.936 --> 01:05:07.970
WAYS TO DO THAT. SHOULD THAT BE

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:08.971
WHAT ONE OF THE POINTS I MAKE

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:12.308
IS WITH RESPECT TO PAGA. AND

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:14.510
APPLYING CARGO TO- THE FORTUNE

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.245
OF REGULATIONS IN WHICH CLEARLY

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:18.648
HAS SOME LARGE IMPLICATIONS SO

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:20.082
AGAIN THEY'VE SHOWN US NO

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:21.317
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THAT'S

01:05:21.384 --> 01:05:22.351
WHAT THIS BILL DOES WERE MORE

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:23.619
THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:24.820
ON THAT PIECE WE'VE WE'VE

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:26.689
ACTUALLY. CONTACTED OUTSIDE

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.024
ATTORNEYS YOU KNOW THAT IT

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.091
WASN'T FLAGGED AS SOMETHING

01:05:29.158 --> 01:05:31.260
FROM FROM- ARE LEGISLATIVE

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:32.795
COUNCIL THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:33.663
DOING WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK

01:05:33.729 --> 01:05:35.531
AT THAT. WE THINK IT'S A RED

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.366
HERRING BUT WILL CONTINUE TO

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:38.234
WORK ON THAT TO ENSURE THAT IT

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:40.670
DOESN'T DO THAT INTO. MOVING

01:05:40.736 --> 01:05:41.470
KIND OF IN A DIFFERENT

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:42.938
DIRECTION. WITH RESPECT TO

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:46.942
CALLOW SHUCKS- THEY MADE THE

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:48.611
POINT THAT DID MANAGE THESE

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:49.679
ISSUES CAN BE ADDRESSED

01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:52.014
SPECIFICALLY. THROUGH AN BY CAL

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:53.449
OSHA SO WHY DO THIS

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:55.251
pLEGISLATIVELY AS OPPOSED TO FOR

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:56.686
US IN SENDING A LETTER. TO CAL

01:05:56.752 --> 01:05:57.853
OSHA URGING AND MAKE THE

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.721
APPROPRIATE CHANGES WERE

01:05:58.788 --> 01:05:59.889
ACTUALLY TELLING THAT'S WHAT

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:00.890
LEGISLATIVE WE'RE DOING WHERE

01:06:00.956 --> 01:06:02.725
WHERE. WHERE FORCING HELLO

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:03.993
SHOULD TO DO THIS WHAT THEY'RE

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:04.894
CONCERNED WITH THERE ARE

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.929
REFERENCING IS EXISTING

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:08.631
REGULATIONS OR STANDARDS IN CAL

01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:10.199
OSHA BUT THOSE STANDARDS ARE

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:13.102
ACTUALLY- NOT SUFFICIENT AND

01:06:13.169 --> 01:06:14.136
THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON THAT

01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:15.604
WE'RE HERE TODAY SO. WHEN THEY

01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:17.640
TALK ABOUT REPETITIVE- THE

01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:19.075
REPORT OF INJURY STANDARD TO

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:20.543
CAL OSHA HAS BASICALLY THAT

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:22.478
SAYS A COMPANY HAS TO HAVE. YOU

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:24.013
KNOW A POLICY AND PROCEDURE AND

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.948
THAT THEY HAVE TO. TALK TO

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:27.516
THEIR EMPLOYEES ABOUT IT WELL

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:29.151
THAT'S HAPPENING AND YET STILL

01:06:29.218 --> 01:06:29.685
WE'RE SEEING THIS

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:30.853
DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.754
INJURIES AND IT'S NOT JUST

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:33.055
REPETITIVE USE INJURIES IT'S A

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:33.723
VARIETY OF THINGS THAT ARE

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:35.925
MAKING THIS WORKSPACE. AND SAFE

01:06:35.991 --> 01:06:37.059
SO TO SUGGEST THAT STANDARDS

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:38.928
THAT EXIST CURRENTLY AND THAT

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:40.062
WE ASSUME OF COURSE AMAZON AND

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:41.897
EVERYBODY ELSE IS A PRIME BY.

01:06:41.964 --> 01:06:43.599
WHICH AREN'T STANDARD TELL YOU

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:44.567
AND I WOULD THINK OF STANDARDS

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:46.135
IT'S NOT SAYING YOU CAN'T DO

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:47.837
THIS FOR YOU YOU THIS IS THIS

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:49.271
IS TOO FAST THIS IS GOING TO

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:50.906
MUCH. THIS IS EXPECTING TOO

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:52.408
MUCH OF A RATE OF SPEED. OR

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:54.143
EXPECTING PEOPLE TO CARRY TOO

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:56.812
MUCH OF. A CERTAIN WEIGHT

01:06:56.879 --> 01:06:58.881
REQUIREMENT AT THE SAME TIME AS

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:01.450
THE RATE OF PACE THAT THEY'RE

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:03.452
GOING- WHAT IT SAYS IS YOU HAVE

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:05.054
TO HAVE A POLICY. YOU HAVE TO

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:06.355
TELL YOUR EMPLOYER THAT POLICY

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:07.857
PROVIDED TRAINING AND TELL THEM

01:07:07.923 --> 01:07:09.024
TO TELL YOU IF THEY GET HURT

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:10.126
THAT'S THE REGULATION RIGHT NOW

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:11.827
THAT IS INSUFFICIENT AND THAT'S

01:07:11.894 --> 01:07:12.895
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN THIS BILL.

01:07:12.962 --> 01:07:14.430
THAT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:15.297
ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON IN

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:17.032
AMAZON WAREHOUSES JAY AND WHY

01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:18.234
WE'RE ASKING CAL OSHA. TO

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.836
PROVIDE- GUIDELINES THAT WOULD

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:22.138
ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE.

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:23.873
JERRY I IDEA TO DO APPRECIATE

01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:25.608
THAT SO. A LOT OF THE

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:27.143
DISCUSSION FACT MOST OF TODAY

USING THIS TYPE OF- ALL THE

01:08:32.074 --> 01:08:34.376
RHYTHM IN STANDARD. THEN THE

SAY IT ONLY APPLIES TO AMAZON

01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:42.184
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:43.619
THAT LARGER WAREHOUSES ARE

01:08:43.686 --> 01:08:45.488

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:47.122
THAT AMAZON IS USING AND WE

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:48.424
FEAR THAT GIVEN THAT THEY'RE

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:49.892

EXPECTED THAT MORE AND MORE

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.365
WAREHOUSES WILL USE THIS. AND

01:08:56.432 --> 01:08:58.167
SO- IT DOES CURRENTLY JUST

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:00.069
APPLIES TO THOSE WHO HAVE A

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:01.437

USING THE RESTROOM. HOWEVER

01:09:36.605 --> 01:09:38.908
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT AMAZON

01:09:38.974 --> 01:09:40.776
CURRENTLY IS JUDGING A

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:42.077
PERFORMANCE STANDARD AND

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:53.722
NOT SUFFOCATING ME TO USE THE

AUTOMATIC AT ISSUE AND IN THERE

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.228
BEING SPENT UP AUTOMATICALLY

THERE'S NO- PROCESS BY WHICH

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:04.466
THIS WOULD AFFECT IT. SO IN

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:05.801
THAT SENSE WE HAVEN'T HEARD

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:07.503
FROM THOSE WHO AREN'T USING

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:08.170
THIS WE HAVE WE'VE HAD

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:10.105
DISCUSSIONS WITH- SMALL

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:16.612
WHAT DOESN'T- WE'D BE HAPPY TO

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:17.780
CONTINUE TO REFINE THAT BUT WE

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:19.515
HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD THAT AS A

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:21.517
FEAR FROM THOSE WHO DON'T USE.

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:24.453
THIS TYPE OF- PACE SETTING

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.522
STANDARD. DID YOU YOU'RE

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:29.124

PROVISIONS THIS BILL MAKE MAKE

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:32.895
CLEAR THERE'S A VERY CLEAR

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:34.430
DELINEATION BETWEEN. IS THIS IS

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:35.598
FROM THIS DOES APPLY BUSINESS

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:36.332
FOR THE PROMISE I THINK IT'S

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:37.366
VERY CLEAR THAT WE'VE HAD

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:40.336
DECADES OF WAREHOUSES. WE

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:43.372
PROBABLY SENTRIES WAREHOUSES-

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:44.807
OBVIOUSLY WENT WHEN WAREHOUSES

01:10:44.873 --> 01:10:45.841
FIRST CAME OUT WE MIGHT HAVE

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:46.942
SOME RULES BUT WE'VE HAD

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:48.611
DECADES WITHOUT THE TYPE OF

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:50.779
INJURIES THAT WERE SEEN NOW. AT

01:10:50.846 --> 01:10:52.915
AMAZON BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT

01:10:52.982 --> 01:10:55.117
THEY'RE REQUIRING A WORK SPEED.

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:56.452
AND BECAUSE OF THAT THAT'S WHAT

01:10:56.518 --> 01:10:57.920
WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IS. IT

01:10:57.987 --> 01:10:59.455
IS THE OBLIGATION OF WORKS BE

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:01.023
THAT SO FAST IT DOESN'T EVEN

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:03.692
ALLOW YOU TO- BASICALLY BE A

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:06.462
HUMAN BEING. AND SO AS YOU KNOW

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.497
THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THAT PACE

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:10.366
AND QUOTA REQUIREMENT I DON'T

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.935
SEE HOW. THESE ISSUES- WHAT A

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:14.670
RISE IN THE SAME WAY. IF

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:16.605
SOMEBODY WANTS TO SAY I WORK AT

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:18.107
A WAREHOUSE THERE IS NO QUOTA

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:20.009
BUT- I'M PENALIZED FOR GOING TO

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:20.542
BATH AND THAT WAS ALREADY

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:21.443
ILLEGAL I DON'T THINK THAT

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:22.845
THAT'S YOU KNOW. THAT THAT'S

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:25.214
NOT THE SOLUTION AND EVEN SO

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.749
THEN. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GO THE

01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:28.717
BATHROOM WAS A LOT BEFORE. BUT

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.252

BREAKS TO EITHER YOUR SORT OF

01:11:42.531 --> 01:11:43.732
COUNTERING I THINK IT'S CLEAR

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:45.100

THE CHANGES IN DIFFERENT

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:47.282
INDUSTRIES IT'S NOT KEEPING UP

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:49.351
WITH HOW THE USE OF ALGORITHMS.

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:51.186

THANK YOU- OUR SISTER SHARE

01:15:03.799 --> 01:15:05.601
MINE IS MORE JUST OF A COMMENT

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:07.903
AND THIS IS COMING FROM A

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:10.172
BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE. IN MY

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:11.907
OPINION IT WOULD BEHOOVE ANY

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:14.910
EMPLOYER. TO CREATE AN

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:17.512
ENVIRONMENT WHERE ITS EMPLOYEES

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:22.985
ARE ONE SAFE AND- AND NOT JUST

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:24.920
MAKE IT SO THAT THEY WANT TO

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:26.321
COME TO WORK AND ENJOY THEIR

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:28.190
WORK AND BE PRODUCTIVE BECAUSE

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:31.260
I KNOW THAT- WHEN YOU PROVIDE

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:32.895
AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS OPTIMAL

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:33.996
THEN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:35.564
THEIR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:37.566
THEY DO THE BEST JOB. AND NOT

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:38.634
ONLY THAT BUT IT ALSO

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:40.936
INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO DO YOU

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:43.005
WANT TO DO HIRE THE BEST PEOPLE

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:47.843
POSSIBLE SO IT IS A LITTLE-

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:50.012
IT'S CONCERNING TO ME THAT. IT

01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:51.413
AND I KNOW RIGHT NOW EVERYONE'S

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.614
REFERENCING AMAZON BUT I'M

01:15:52.681 --> 01:15:55.150
THINKING IN GENERAL'S EMPLOYERS

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:56.952
THAT YOU'D WANT TO CREATE AN

01:15:57.019 --> 01:15:57.519
ENVIRONMENT THAT WOULD BE

01:15:57.586 --> 01:16:02.424
OPTIMAL FOR ONE NUMBER TWO. TO

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:04.359
CREATE AN AND SAVE BUSINESS

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:06.361
PRACTICE MODEL I THINK WOULD

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:09.331
BE. AN ABSOLUTE DISSERVICE TO

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:13.168
ANY EMPLOYER BECAUSE- YOUR YOUR

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.437
WORKERS COMP LIABILITY GOES UP.

01:16:15.504 --> 01:16:16.872
WHEN YOU DON'T PROVIDE THE

01:16:16.939 --> 01:16:19.074
OPTIMAL ENVIRONMENT SO I'M

01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:21.977
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. IN MY

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:24.813
MIND AS TO ONE. WHAT WOULD NOT

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.715
WHAT WOULD NOT HELLO NOT THAT

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:29.651
WAY. WHY WOULD AN EMPLOYER NOT

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:33.989
PROVIDE OR OR MODIFIED TO MODEL

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:35.624
SO THAT IT DOESN'T CREATE

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:38.827
HEALTH AND SAFETY HAZARD NUMBER

01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:40.996
TWO- TAKING CONSIDERATION THE

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:42.898
SAFETY OF THE EMPLOYERS AS WELL

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:45.300
AS MAKING SURE THAT. YOU DON'T

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:47.302
WANT THE COST OF DOING AND NOT

01:16:47.369 --> 01:16:49.504
ONLY THAT BUT ALSO THINKING OF

01:16:49.571 --> 01:16:51.440
THE TURN OVER. BECAUSE WHEN YOU

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:53.675
DON'T HAVE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT.

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:55.978
IS OPTIMAL THEN YOU'RE GOING TO

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:58.046
HAVE A HIGH TURNOVER SO NOT

01:16:58.113 --> 01:16:59.014
ONLY IS YOUR WORKERS COMP GOING

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:01.183
TO GO UP YOUR TURN OVER FOR

01:17:01.249 --> 01:17:03.685
TRAINING AND SO FORTH. I'M

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:06.288
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. WHAT

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:08.357
WOULD NOT Y. THESE EMPLOYERS

01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:09.558
WOULD NOT WANT TO DO THAT

01:17:09.624 --> 01:17:10.926
ALREADY WHY IS THIS NECESSARY

01:17:10.993 --> 01:17:12.995
AND NOT IN THE BUSINESS PARTNER

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:13.595
SPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE AT THAT

01:17:13.662 --> 01:17:17.532
CALIBER- THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:17:17.599 --> 01:17:18.133
WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST ALREADY

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.068
DO THAT. WHAT THAT I THINK THAT

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:22.671
IS A FANTASTIC QUESTION- AND I

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:24.673
UNFORTUNATELY IT COMES DOWN TO

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:26.775
DOLLARS AND CENTS SO- JUST LIKE

01:17:26.842 --> 01:17:28.243
KEVIN ALDER THEM TO DECIDE HOW

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.711
MUCH PEOPLE SHOULD WORK IN ALL

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:30.846
GRADE THEM TO DECIDE WHAT'S IN

01:17:30.912 --> 01:17:32.314
THEIR BEST BUSINESS PRACTICE.

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:33.515
HOW CAN THEY MAKE THE MOST

01:17:33.582 --> 01:17:35.384
AMOUNT OF MONEY AND WHAT THEY

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.552
DECIDED IT IS AN- YOU DON'T.

01:17:37.619 --> 01:17:40.822
IT'S NOT I'M NOT GIVING YOU. M.

01:17:40.889 --> 01:17:41.690
YOU KNOW I COULD TALK TO

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:43.225
WORKERS AND I HEAR WORKERS FEEL

01:17:43.291 --> 01:17:45.460
THIS WAY AN INDIVIDUAL KIND OF

01:17:45.527 --> 01:17:46.762
STORIES I CAN TELL YOU THE

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:49.431
FACTS. IN COUNTIES THAT HAD

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:51.500
NOTE AMAZON DISTRIBUTION CENTER

01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:53.735
PREVIOUSLY. THE TURNOVER RATE

01:17:53.802 --> 01:17:55.604
FOR WAREHOUSE WORKERS WAS ABOUT

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:58.073
38% A YEAR. AFTER THOSE SAME

01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.141
COUNTIES COUNTIES IN FACT IN

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:00.942
THE INLAND EMPIRE. THAT THEN

01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:02.377
HAD AMAZON DISTRIBUTION

01:18:02.444 --> 01:18:04.880
CENTERS- DEVELOP IN THEIR

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:06.481
COUNTY. THE TURNOVER RATE

01:18:06.548 --> 01:18:08.250
OVERALL FOR WAREHOUSE WORKERS

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:10.452
JUMPED OVER A HUNDRED AND 50% A

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:12.421
YEAR. THAT TELLS YOU THAT THEY

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:13.021
ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT TURNING

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:14.356
THROUGH EMPLOYEES. THEY'VE

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:15.791
DECIDED THAT PAINT A CERTAIN

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:17.692
WAGE TO GET PEOPLE IN THE DOOR

01:18:17.759 --> 01:18:18.994
AND UTILIZING THEM IT'S IN

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:20.562
THEIR BEST BUSINESS PRACTICE.

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:21.930
NOW THEIR THEIR WORKERS COMP

01:18:21.997 --> 01:18:24.099
RATES LIKEWISE HAVE TO BE.

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:26.134
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. BUT ANY

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:28.603
COMPANY THAT HAS- I GUESS THE

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:31.540
ABILITY TO MONETIZE HUMAN WORK

01:18:31.606 --> 01:18:32.474
IN THAT WAY TO MONETIZE

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:33.975
PEOPLE'S INJURIES IN THE STATE

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:35.110
IS IT WORTH IT TO BURN

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:36.678
THRILLED. AND INJURE EMPLOYEES

01:18:36.745 --> 01:18:38.246
BECAUSE IN THE LONG RUN WHAT

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:39.714
WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO DOMINATE

01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:40.682
THIS FIELD WE'RE GOING TO GET

01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:42.117
EVERYTHING OUT AS QUICKLY AS

01:18:42.184 --> 01:18:43.218
POSSIBLE WE'RE GOING TO SET A

01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:44.186
STANDARD WE'RE GOING TO MAKE. A

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:46.154
TON OF MONEY THAT'S WHAT AMAZON

01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:47.756
HAS DONE. WE KNOW THAT WE CAN

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:49.057
ALL LOOK AT THESE ARE ALL.

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:50.792
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA I'M

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:52.727
NOT. GIVING YOU SOME YOU KNOW

01:18:52.794 --> 01:18:54.362
SECRET THIS IS PROBABLY ABOUT

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:56.164
AVAILABLE IT'S THE SAME WAY.

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:57.666
AND I WILL SAY WE THOUGHT WITH

01:18:57.732 --> 01:18:58.900
UNIONIZING EFFORTS RIGHT SAME

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:00.702
WAY THEY BREAK LABOR LAWS IN

01:19:00.769 --> 01:19:02.404
FIRE UNION ORGANIZERS BECAUSE

01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:03.972
IT RATHER PAY THAT COST THAN

01:19:04.039 --> 01:19:05.006
WHAT IT WOULD COST THEM TO HAVE

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:06.541
A UNION IN THEIR WORKPLACE.

01:19:06.608 --> 01:19:08.410
IT'S ALL RATIONAL IF ALL YOU

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:09.744
CARE ABOUT IS YOUR BOTTOM LINE

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:11.680
IN YOUR BUSINESS MAKING MONEY.

01:19:11.746 --> 01:19:12.747
THAT'S OFTEN NOT WHAT WE'RE

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:14.082
SEEING A MOM AND POP WAREHOUSES

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:15.517
AND THAT'S WHY. THERE IS A

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:16.618
DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:17.819
ARE TREATED RIGHT THERE IF YOU

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.287
HAVE. THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:20.689
BIGGEST EMPLOYER IN THE UNITED

01:19:20.755 --> 01:19:22.023
STATES YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:22.924
THE INDIVIDUAL WORKER YOU'RE

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:24.392
LOOKING AT HOW MUCH MY MAKING

01:19:24.459 --> 01:19:25.760
FOR MIGHT. SHAREHOLDERS AND MY

01:19:25.827 --> 01:19:27.028
C. E. L. THE WHAT WE KNOW

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:28.363
THAT'S A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY ON

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:31.766
AMAZON. SO AM. I KNOW THAT ALL

01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:33.835
OF US WITH WOULD LIKE TO SAY

01:19:33.902 --> 01:19:37.272
YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:37.939
AT THIS THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:38.573
BUT IT BOB. MAKES SENSE FOR THE

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.675
BOTTOM LINE. AB THEIR WORKERS

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:42.444
THAT EVERY REPORT CAME OUT EVEN

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:43.411
WHEN I HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:44.813
AMAZON THEY DON'T DENY THAT

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.181
THEIR WORK FORCE IS GETTING

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:47.449
HURT AT HIGHER RATES THAN OTHER

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:49.184
WAREHOUSES IN. IN A MUCH HIGHER

01:19:49.251 --> 01:19:50.585
RATE THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:51.720
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT DOESN'T

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:52.521
ONLY AFFECT THEM BECAUSE THE

01:19:52.587 --> 01:19:54.723
WAY WORKERS COMP IS DONE. THESE

01:19:54.789 --> 01:19:55.957
OTHER WAREHOUSES ARE PAYING

01:19:56.024 --> 01:19:57.692
MORE WORKERS COMP CLAIMS NOW

01:19:57.759 --> 01:20:00.362
BECAUSE AMAZON'S- IT THAT THEIR

01:20:00.428 --> 01:20:02.063
INDUSTRY STANDARD IS SO WIDE

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:02.964
AND THEY HAVE SO MUCH OF THE

01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:03.832
MARKET SHARE THAT THEY'RE

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:05.066
AFFECTING. ALL WORKERS COMP

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:06.868
RATES SO IF YOU'RE NOT.

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:08.470
OPERATING THIS WAY YOU'RE

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:09.704
GETTING HURT BY THEIR PRACTICES

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:12.707
AS WELL. BUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING

01:20:12.774 --> 01:20:13.275
THE BENEFIT OF JUST TURNING

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:18.914
THREE WORKERS. THANK YOU. OR

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.216
SHOULD I SAY THERE'S ALWAYS AN

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:21.816
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD IT'LL TAKE A

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:23.518
FIFTEEN DOLLAR WAGED ON. MANY

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:25.921
YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY NOT

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:28.690
KNOWING THE CONSEQUENCES. FOUR

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:30.458
I APPRECIATE THE CONSEQUENCE OF

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:32.594
WHAT IT'LL DO TO YOUR BODY. AS

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.496
MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES ON THE

01:20:34.563 --> 01:20:36.097
COMMITTEE I ACTUALLY ALSO SPOKE

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:39.167
WITH THE OPPOSITION AND- I WAS.

01:20:39.234 --> 01:20:40.936
IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE I

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:44.472
DID NOT SEE- I JUST PERSONALLY

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:45.640
I'M ALWAYS NERVOUS ABOUT THE

01:20:45.707 --> 01:20:47.275
STATE COMING IN AND PUTTING ONE

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:49.077
STANDARD ONE SIZE FITS ALL ON

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:51.446
EVERY SINGLE INDUSTRY- BECAUSE

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:52.647
THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT THEY'RE

01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:54.416
THEY'RE- THEY'RE DIFFERENT. AND

01:20:54.482 --> 01:20:56.218
SO MODELS ARE DIFFERENT AND

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:57.619
INTERESTING AND DIFFERENT AND I

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:59.621
JUST I'M I'M NERVOUS ABOUT.

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:01.189
ANYTHING THAT JUST SAYS OKAY

01:21:01.256 --> 01:21:02.157
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:03.225
STANDARD WIRELESS THROUGHOUT

COMES TO EMPLOYMENT AND

01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:07.762
DIFFERENT DEALS A MODEL SO.

01:21:07.829 --> 01:21:08.863
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:11.066
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT THIS BILL AS

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:14.436

I HAD MY WAY I WOULD NEVER WANT

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:21.543
THE STATE TO COME IN AND HAVE

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:23.878
BROAD REGULATIONS THAT THIS IT

01:21:23.945 --> 01:21:24.913
JUST LIKE WE HEARD FROM THAT

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:27.749
WORKER AT THE UPS- DISTRIBUTION

CENTER THAT IS WHAT WE WILL

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:30.919
THAT IS THE- THAT THE BEST

01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:32.420
OUTCOME WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:33.655
WORKER IN A WORKPLACE HAS A

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:34.623
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:36.258
AND HAS A WAY TO DISCUSS. A

01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:37.659
SAFETY CONCERN WITH THEIR

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:40.462
MANAGER WITHOUT BEING- WITH

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:41.429
WITHOUT BEING RETALIATED

01:21:41.496 --> 01:21:42.364
AGAINST AND HAVING THAT THAT'S

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:44.032
A FREE MARKET APPROACH TO

01:21:44.099 --> 01:21:45.367
HAVING SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE

01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:46.668
IS ACTUALLY TO HAVE A UNION BUT

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.336
WE KNOW AMAZON WON'T ALLOW.

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:50.205
THEIR THEIR WAREHOUSES BE

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:51.373
UNIONIZED EITHER THAT WAS

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:52.607
ANOTHER THING I OPPOSED TO THE

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:54.009
COMPANY THEMSELVES WHAT IS THE

01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:55.744
ANSWER IF NOT THIS BECAUSE I

01:21:55.810 --> 01:22:00.181
AGREE I'D RATHER. US NOT HAVE

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:01.650
TO- GET INTO. WHAT IS AN

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:02.951
ACCEPTABLE STANDARD THE WORKER

01:22:03.018 --> 01:22:04.352
KNOWS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:05.720
TALK TO THE MANAGER ABOUT IT

01:22:05.787 --> 01:22:06.655
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY

01:22:06.721 --> 01:22:07.956
SOMETHING THAT IS UNSAFE AND

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:09.124
REFUSED TO DO IT THAT'S WHAT

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:10.925
SHOULD HAPPEN. AMAZON WON'T LET

01:22:10.992 --> 01:22:12.227
IT HAPPEN THERE SO THEN WERE

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:13.995
FORCED TO DO THINGS THAT ARE

01:22:14.062 --> 01:22:15.297
ONE SIZE FITS ALL OUR FEEL MORE

01:22:15.363 --> 01:22:16.698
LIKE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. THIS

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.633

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.702
WAREHOUSES THAT USE QUOTAS THAT

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:23.104

WHETHER THEY'RE THEY HAVE NOT

01:22:27.475 --> 01:22:29.878
RETALIATED AGAINST AND THAT-

01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:31.146
ARE JUST LARGE WAREHOUSES SO

01:22:31.212 --> 01:22:32.747
IT'S NEARLY TAILORED AS MUCH AS

01:22:32.814 --> 01:22:36.051
WE CAN BUT I I'M WITH YOU ON

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:36.651
THAT. I THINK THERE'S A BETTER

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:39.921
WAY TO DO IT. THE CONSUMERS WHO

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:41.690

WOULD LOVE TO GO BACK AND SEE

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:36.457
THE DATA- YOU KNOW ON ON ON THE

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:38.860
DAY HE WALKED OUT OF THERE. AS

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:40.628
TO WHAT HE WAS DOING THE PRIOR

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:41.996
NINETY DAYS WHICH IS SOMETHING

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:43.498
THAT'S BEEN. PUT INTO THIS BILL

01:26:43.565 --> 01:26:45.900
I DON'T THINK THAT'S- AN OVER

01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:47.802
REACH I THINK THAT'S- IT IS A

01:26:47.869 --> 01:26:49.237
SIGN OF THE TIMES IT IS

01:26:49.304 --> 01:26:50.738

DATA THAT PEOPLE CAN. TRACK

01:26:52.507 --> 01:26:54.309

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:55.710

MORE OF THIS BUT I ALSO THINK

01:27:04.385 --> 01:27:05.486
IT NEEDS TO BE A COLLABORATIVE

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:07.755
PROCESS WEEK WE'D- WE PROBABLY

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.757
DON'T WANT TO BE. AT ODDS WITH

01:27:09.824 --> 01:27:11.693
THE VERY INDUSTRIES SAID OUR

01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:13.595
POINT PEOPLE- IN WE'RE GONNA

01:27:13.661 --> 01:27:15.196
HAVE TO DO SOME OF IT THIS WAY

01:27:15.263 --> 01:27:15.897
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE ARE

01:41:01.989 --> 01:41:03.657
NECESSARY BEFORE COVE IT AND

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:05.192
WILL BE NECESSARY AFTER CO BAD

01:41:05.259 --> 01:41:06.727
AND I'LL EXPLAIN THIS. SO WHAT

01:41:06.794 --> 01:41:07.628
COULD HAVE HAPPENED DURING

01:41:07.694 --> 01:41:08.595
COBIT AND OF COURSE OUR

01:41:08.662 --> 01:41:10.764
RETENTION- LANGUAGE THAT WE GOT

01:41:10.831 --> 01:41:12.232
THROUGH THE BUDGET HELPS BUT

01:41:12.299 --> 01:41:14.301
WHAT COULD HAPPEN IS A CONTRACT

01:41:14.368 --> 01:41:15.068
EXPIRES YOU HAVE A NEW

01:41:15.135 --> 01:41:17.137
CONTRCTOR COMING IN. AND SO

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:18.605
EVEN THOUGH THAT THAT WORK OR

01:41:18.672 --> 01:41:19.840
IF THEY WORK FOR THE HALL HOTEL

01:41:19.907 --> 01:41:21.275
WOULD HAVE RETENTION RIGHTS.

01:41:21.341 --> 01:41:22.810
THEY THEY AREN'T BEING CALLED

01:41:22.876 --> 01:41:24.378
BACK FOR BECAUSE THEIR CONTRACT

01:41:24.445 --> 01:41:27.381
HAS HAS BEEN- DISMISSED IF YOU

01:41:27.448 --> 01:41:30.517
WILL OR REPLACED. SO THAT HAS A

01:41:30.584 --> 01:41:31.151
AFFECT ON THOSE WORKERS

01:41:31.218 --> 01:41:32.986
HOWEVER. JUST LIKE THE

01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:34.021
JANITORIAL WORKERS THIS IS BEEN

01:41:34.087 --> 01:41:35.389
IN PLACE FOR TWENTY YEARS

01:41:35.456 --> 01:41:37.191
BECAUSE LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE IN

01:41:37.257 --> 01:41:38.692
UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:40.160
REALIZE THAT MAYBE CO THAT HAS

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:42.863
MADE US REALIZE THAT EVEN MORE-

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:44.598
THAT IT SEEMS THE APPROPRIATE

01:41:44.665 --> 01:41:46.400
TIME TO AND WE WERE WORKING ON

01:41:46.467 --> 01:41:47.668
THIS PRIOR TO COVE IT IT'S NOT

01:41:47.734 --> 01:41:49.036
YOU KNOW IT JUST BE IT BECAME

01:41:49.102 --> 01:41:50.804
MORE MAGNIFIED. THAT THERE WHEN

01:41:50.871 --> 01:41:52.072
THERE IS A CHANGE OF CONTRACTOR

01:41:52.139 --> 01:41:53.373
YOU'RE WORKING YOU'RE TALKING

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:54.942
ABOUT PRIMARILY M. AS AN

01:41:55.008 --> 01:41:57.411
IMMIGRANT WORK FORCE- PRIMARILY

01:41:57.478 --> 01:42:00.514
AT. AS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN

01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:11.825
LOW. PAID JOBS WHO- BY NO FAULT

01:42:11.892 --> 01:42:12.960
OF THEIR OWN- A NEW CAR. AND

01:42:13.026 --> 01:42:13.527
SHOULD LEAST HAVE THE OP TO

01:42:13.594 --> 01:42:14.228
PROVE THEMSELVES IT NOT RE. THE

01:42:14.294 --> 01:42:15.729
HùTO KEEP EIGHTY EMPLOY. WHO

01:42:15.796 --> 01:42:17.364
IS NOT PER. IN- AT PAR IN FACT

01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:18.365
THE- WHO KNOWS THAT THE BEST IS

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:20.868
THAT IT THE HOTEL- THEMSELVES

01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:21.835
TOO AND THEY CAN TELL AND SHARE

01:42:21.902 --> 01:42:23.370
THAT WITH THE NEW CONTRACTOR.

01:42:23.437 --> 01:42:26.673
THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE- THE

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.775
COMPANY TO KEEP A BAD EMPLOYEE

01:42:28.842 --> 01:42:30.310
IF YOU WELL AND IN FACT BUT

01:42:30.377 --> 01:42:31.712
WHAT PEOPLE MISS IN THIS ISN'T

01:42:31.778 --> 01:42:33.480
LIKE NORMAL CONTRACTING HAS IT

01:42:33.547 --> 01:42:35.282
WOULD SEEM. THE SUPERVISORS AND

01:42:35.349 --> 01:42:36.783
MANAGEMENT ACTUALLY WORK FOR

01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:38.552
THE HOTEL NOT THE CONTRACTOR-

01:42:38.619 --> 01:42:40.754
MOST OFTEN SO THEY ARE ALREADY

01:42:40.821 --> 01:42:42.489
HAVING THAT INFORMATION ABOUT

01:42:42.556 --> 01:42:43.657
EMPLOYEES WHO SHOULD BE

01:42:43.724 --> 01:42:44.525
DISMISSED AND ARE LREADY IN

01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:45.993
THE PROCESS. OF DISMISSING

01:42:46.059 --> 01:42:47.394
THOSE EMPLOYEES UNDER THE

01:42:47.461 --> 01:42:49.162
PREVIOUS CONTRACT. AND

01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:50.664
SECONDING I GUESS MISS OFTEN

01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:56.103
REYES SO THE ISSUE AROUND.

01:42:56.169 --> 01:42:56.670
FIFTEEN HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT-

01:42:56.737 --> 01:42:58.171
AND THE POSSIBLE TO ME MY DO

01:42:58.238 --> 01:42:59.172
SEPARATE OUR A DIFFERENT. LOOK

01:42:59.239 --> 01:43:01.675
IT YOU WILL TO. THE NEXT

01:43:01.742 --> 01:43:02.976
CLARIFYING THE LANGUAGE AS

01:43:03.043 --> 01:43:04.211
WELL. THAT IS THE FIRST TIME

01:43:04.278 --> 01:43:05.412
I'VE HEARD THAT ARGUMENT AND

01:43:05.479 --> 01:43:06.413
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BECAUSE

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.515
ANYBODY WHO HAS- WHEN AS PART

01:43:08.582 --> 01:43:11.051
TIME EMPLOYMENT THERE ARE MANY-WORKERS WHO WORK AT MULTIPLE

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:12.786
LOCATIONS IN ORDER TO. COBBLE

01:43:12.853 --> 01:43:14.788
TOGETHER A FULL TIME SALARY-

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:16.189
BUT THAT LOCATION THAT THEY'RE

01:43:16.256 --> 01:43:17.758
WORKING OUT IS CONSIDERED THEIR

01:43:17.824 --> 01:43:20.027
JOB FOR THAT MOUNT SO- I'M

01:43:20.093 --> 01:43:22.296
ASSUMING IT IF AN EMPLOYER. AND

01:43:22.362 --> 01:43:23.497
EMPLOYEE WANTS TO STAY WITH A

01:43:23.564 --> 01:43:24.698
CERTAIN CONTRACTOR AND THEY'RE

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:26.033
BEING MAINTAINED BY THAT

01:43:26.099 --> 01:43:27.100
CONTRACTOR AND OTHER POSITIONS

01:43:27.167 --> 01:43:28.168
THAT'S IRRELEVANT TO WHETHER

01:43:28.235 --> 01:43:30.237
THEY CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK

01:43:30.304 --> 01:43:32.005
AT THAT. LOCATION OKAY MA'AM

01:43:32.072 --> 01:43:33.040

01:43:33.106 --> 01:43:34.608
YOU NOTICE I MEAN AS WITH YUR

PREVIOUS BILLS THE WORLD'S

01:43:35.642 --> 01:43:37.110
CHANGED GREAT DEAL LAST TWENTY

01:43:37.177 --> 01:43:39.046
YEARS AGO. NUMBER SPECIALIZED

01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:40.847
SERVICES THE IN OWN COUNTRIES

01:43:40.914 --> 01:43:42.549

01:43:42.616 --> 01:43:44.251
NARROW SERVICES JOE TELLS YOU

01:43:44.318 --> 01:43:46.753
ROOMS AND PARKING CARS WELL THE

01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:48.322
YOU KNOW. MORE LIKE RESERVATION

01:43:48.388 --> 01:43:50.390
TAKING IN. THE RESERVATION

01:43:50.457 --> 01:43:51.325
TAKING ISN'T PART OF THE

01:43:51.391 --> 01:43:52.693
COUNTRY SHOULD ANSWER WHY I WAS

01:43:52.759 --> 01:43:53.927
GOING TO SAY AND I AM GRATEFUL

01:43:53.994 --> 01:43:55.529
OR DIE GESAMTE COMMITTEE FOR

01:43:55.596 --> 01:43:57.531
PIG SHIFTING- THE AMENDMENTS TO

01:43:57.598 --> 01:44:00.701
CLARIFY IN THOSE AREAS BUT- YOU

01:44:00.767 --> 01:44:04.404
KNOW THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY.

01:44:04.471 --> 01:44:04.938
SOMEBODY WORKS IN MULTIPLE

01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:05.939
LOCATIONS AND SO. AB IT SEEMS

01:44:06.006 --> 01:44:07.074
CHANGE REGIONAL FIFTY HOURS IS

01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:08.542
GOING OF A SMALL AMOUNT CUT

01:44:08.609 --> 01:44:10.444
THAT UP SOME MORE. MAYBE THAT'S

01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:12.245
REASONABLE TO CONSIDER SOME

01:44:12.312 --> 01:44:14.615
CLARIFICATION. FIFTEEN HOURS

01:44:14.681 --> 01:44:16.049
THEY HAVE TO AT LEAST WORK

01:44:16.116 --> 01:44:17.084
FIFTEEN HOURS AT THAT PRIMARY

01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:18.285
LOCATION AT THE PRIMARY

01:44:18.352 --> 01:44:19.953
LOCATION HIGHER IS THAT WE ARE

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:21.722
SUGGEST WELL ADULT GAS I MEAN

01:44:21.788 --> 01:44:22.856
THAT THERE WAS MISS HAWKINS

01:44:22.923 --> 01:44:24.391
CONCERNED THAT IT WASN'T AT ONE

01:44:24.458 --> 01:44:26.893
LOCATION MIGHT BE A MOBILE WITH

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:29.563
MULTIPLE LOCATIONS. BUT WE CAN

01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:31.498
LEAVE IT I SEEM TO CONFUSE YOU

01:44:31.565 --> 01:44:35.435
M. I AM CONFUSED A LITTLE BIT.

01:44:35.502 --> 01:44:37.270
WE COULD TALK FURTHER WE DON'T

01:44:37.337 --> 01:44:38.639
HAVE TO SUBMIT MY UNDERSTANDING

01:44:38.705 --> 01:44:40.240
FROM HER FROM HER TESTAMENT

01:44:40.307 --> 01:44:41.908
ACTUALLY IS SHE STILL HERE

01:44:41.975 --> 01:44:43.477
SHE'S STILL HERE SO IF YOU

01:44:43.543 --> 01:44:44.878
WOULD MIND CLARIFYING.

01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:47.114
MEASUREMENTS SO I'M NOT

01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:47.714
SPEAKING FOR YOU IN A WAY THAT

01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:51.852
DOES MAKE SENSE. SO YOU KNOW

01:44:51.918 --> 01:44:53.520
TWO OF OUR POINTS I THINK RATES

01:44:53.587 --> 01:44:54.821
ARE UNDER THE DEFINITIONS IN

01:44:54.888 --> 01:44:56.857
THE BILL. THERE'S KIND OF TWO

01:44:56.923 --> 01:44:58.425
LIMITATIONS RIGHT ONE IS THAT A

01:44:58.492 --> 01:44:59.926
CONTRACTOR MEANS SOMEONE WHO

01:44:59.993 --> 01:45:01.261
PLAYS TWENTY FIVE OR MORE AND

01:45:01.328 --> 01:45:02.929
IT'S NOT CLEAR THERE. WHETHER

01:45:02.996 --> 01:45:04.031
THAT MEANS TWENTY FIVE OR MORE

01:45:04.097 --> 01:45:05.832
PEOPLE AT LIKE ONE HOTEL OR ONE

01:45:05.899 --> 01:45:07.668
LOCATION OR NOT AND THEN. THE

01:45:07.734 --> 01:45:08.935
SECOND AND THERE'S NO COURT

01:45:09.002 --> 01:45:09.903
CASES INTERPRETING THAT'S

01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:11.304
RUNNING SHORT THE SECOND I

01:45:11.371 --> 01:45:13.340
THINK IT IS A THE FIFTEEN HOUR

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:15.308
PER WEEK **** AND SUBSECTION C.

01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:17.344
OF TEN SIXTEEN- THAT SO

01:45:17.411 --> 01:45:19.179
ESSENTIALLY FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO

01:45:19.246 --> 01:45:21.148
FALL UNDER THIS BILL. YOU HAVE

01:45:21.214 --> 01:45:22.382
TO WORK A LEAST FIFTEEN HOURS

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:24.251
PER WEEK YOUR PRIMARY PLACE OF

01:45:24.317 --> 01:45:25.285
EMPLOYMENT HAS TO BE IN THE

01:45:25.352 --> 01:45:26.987
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNDER A

01:45:27.054 --> 01:45:29.289
CONTRACT TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW

01:45:29.356 --> 01:45:30.090
WHAT WOULD BE AN ALCATEL

01:45:30.157 --> 01:45:33.060
SERVICES. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I

01:45:33.126 --> 01:45:35.629
AM A HOTEL WORKER UNDER THIS

01:45:35.696 --> 01:45:37.864
BILL RIGHT I PROVIDE- I DON'T

01:45:37.931 --> 01:45:39.466
VALLEY SERVICES I GUESS AND I

01:45:39.533 --> 01:45:41.935
WORK. FORTY HOURS A WEEK BUT I

01:45:42.002 --> 01:45:43.503
WORK FIVE HOURS A WEEK AT ONE

01:45:43.570 --> 01:45:44.705
HOTEL BUT RICK THIRTY FIVE

01:45:44.771 --> 01:45:45.872
HOURS A WEEK AND A DIFFERENT

01:45:45.939 --> 01:45:48.241
HOTEL AND THE HOTEL CONTRACTOR

01:45:48.308 --> 01:45:49.076
I WORK FIVE HOURS A WEEK IS

01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:51.778
CANCELED. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I

01:45:51.845 --> 01:45:53.613
KNOW FALL UNDER THE DEFINITION

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:58.985
OF EMPLOYEE. UNDER THIS. ACT

01:45:59.052 --> 01:46:01.188
AND SO YOU KNOW I WOULD THEN.

01:46:01.254 --> 01:46:02.723
THE NEW VALLEY AT THAT SUPPORT

01:46:02.789 --> 01:46:14.401
TO WHERE I ONLY WORK FIVE HOURS.

01:46:14.468 --> 01:46:15.001
WOULD HAVE STILL HAVE TO HIRE

01:46:15.068 --> 01:46:16.169
ME AWAY. I WANNA BE CLEAR AND

01:46:16.236 --> 01:46:19.606
NOT VETS IN THIS AN JUST TRY

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:20.173
TO. THERE YOU HAVE IT THAT'S

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:20.907
HELD OUT SERVICE WORK YOU'RE A

01:46:20.974 --> 01:46:21.541

PROVIDER THE VALLEYS SERVICES

01:46:22.309 --> 01:46:23.009
SO THEY DO GET BROKEN BY FIVE

01:46:23.076 --> 01:46:23.777
BUT THERE MIGHT AN EMERGENCY SO.

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:25.011
WE SOMEBODY HAD TO FILL IN. AB

01:46:25.078 --> 01:46:26.513
I DON'T WANT TO I. YOU KNOW SHE

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:27.114
SAID SOMETHING THAT WE FOUND.

01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:28.615
AND SHE'S NOT SURE THIS WORKS

01:46:28.682 --> 01:46:30.250
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN EXISTENCE FOR

01:46:30.317 --> 01:46:31.051
TWENTY YEARS AND THERE'S NO

01:46:31.118 --> 01:46:32.385
LAWSUIT TO SUGGEST THAT IT

01:46:32.452 --> 01:46:34.855
DOESN'T WORK. SO I AM NOT ONE

01:46:34.921 --> 01:46:35.922
WHO'S GOING TO COME IN AND

01:46:35.989 --> 01:46:36.923

PROTECTION- THAT HAS WORKED FOR

01:46:39.993 --> 01:46:41.795
TWENTY PLUS YEARS. AND HAS BEEN

01:46:41.862 --> 01:46:44.998
A RESOUNDING SUCCESS IT HAS THE

01:46:45.065 --> 01:46:47.167
SAME TYPE OF MIGRATORY NATURE

01:46:47.234 --> 01:46:49.936
AS- CONTACTED BACK MORE SO THAN

01:46:50.003 --> 01:46:51.838
THEY DO IN A HOTEL ASPECT. THAT

01:46:51.905 --> 01:46:53.673
BEING SAID I'D I'D BE HAPPY TO

01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:55.742
TALK THROUGH THAT- WE ARE

01:46:55.809 --> 01:46:57.010
SAYING IF YOU WORK FIFTEEN

01:46:57.077 --> 01:46:58.912
HOURS AT A SPECIFIC LOCATION

01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:00.781
YOUR CONTRACTOR THAT. THAT

01:47:00.847 --> 01:47:03.016
HOTEL M. THERE MIGHT BE A

01:47:03.083 --> 01:47:04.417
SITUATION WHERE A CHAIN OF

01:47:04.484 --> 01:47:06.086
HOTELS HAS THE SAME CONTRACTOR

01:47:06.153 --> 01:47:06.987
THEY'RE GOING FROM HOTEL TO

01:47:07.053 --> 01:47:09.756
HOTEL. AND THAT THAT'S SIMILAR

01:47:09.823 --> 01:47:11.625
TO JANITORIAL WE STILL REQUIRE

TO CLARIFY WHAT I SAID IS NOT

01:47:42.055 --> 01:47:42.756
THAT THERE'S EVER BEEN QUITE

01:47:42.823 --> 01:47:43.957

JUST PICKING APART SOMETHING

01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:26.466
THAT COULD BE A FUTURE. BECAUSE

01:48:26.533 --> 01:48:27.634
FOR A LAWSUIT I GUESS WE COULD

01:48:27.701 --> 01:48:28.735
DO THAT FOR EVERY BILL THAT

01:48:28.802 --> 01:48:30.270
WHEN WE HAVE A LOT IN WHAT

01:48:31.338 --> 01:48:33.039
CHANGING. EXISTING LAW WE'RE

01:48:33.106 --> 01:48:34.708
TAKING THE EXISTING LAW AND

01:48:34.774 --> 01:48:36.810
ADDING SIMILARLY SITUATED

01:48:36.877 --> 01:48:39.512
EMPLOYEES TO THAT LAW JANITORS

01:48:39.579 --> 01:48:41.414

ACTUALLY WORK FOR A CONTRACTOR.

01:48:50.423 --> 01:48:51.992
IF THE HOTEL CHANGES THE

WHATEVER DIFFERENT REASONS.

01:51:04.224 --> 01:51:06.159
THOSE WORKERS HUNDREDS OF THEM

01:51:12.332 --> 01:51:15.035
WITH A FEW PLOYS WHO WEREN'T

01:51:15.101 --> 01:51:19.072

OF THAT BEFORE THE STATE

01:51:37.824 --> 01:51:41.027
JANITORIAL OF LAW WAS PASSED

01:51:41.094 --> 01:51:43.163

EMPLOYEES. WHO AREN'T

01:52:03.683 --> 01:52:06.019
PERFORMING AT PAR THAT COULD

01:52:06.086 --> 01:52:08.188
EASILY BE TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE

01:52:08.254 --> 01:52:09.289
THE HOTEL COULD TELL THE

DEAL WITH IT BUT IT'S ALWAYS

01:52:19.099 --> 01:52:23.736
BEEN USED AS A WAY TO- FOR THE

01:52:23.803 --> 01:52:25.939
INCUMBENT CONTRACTOR TO PAY A

TO GET A PASS A LAW LIKE THIS

01:52:38.852 --> 01:52:41.554

IF THE CONTRACTOR THAT

CURRENTLY HOUSES EMPLOYEES-

01:53:39.612 --> 01:53:41.447

WORKERS SOON MEAN HERE

01:53:51.491 --> 01:53:52.892

UNEMPLOYED AT THIS PARTICULAR

01:53:58.998 --> 01:54:01.100
SITE BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF THE

01:54:01.167 --> 01:54:03.903
CONTRACTOR MOVES TO A DIFFERENT

01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:06.272
SITE AND HE NEEDS THESE

01:54:06.339 --> 01:54:08.107
EMPLOYEES TO GO TO THE NEXT

01:54:08.174 --> 01:54:13.313

DOES HOW DO WE WORK AROUND

01:54:14.314 --> 01:54:17.684
THAT- NOTION FOR THE NEED FOR

01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:19.452
THE ACTUAL CONTRACTOR MOVING

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:22.088
FORWARD M. WELL A CONTRACTOR

01:54:22.155 --> 01:54:24.457

FORCE SOMEBODY TO WORK FOR THEM

01:54:26.392 --> 01:54:28.661
THAT'S FOUNDATIONAL I THINK TO

01:54:28.728 --> 01:54:31.264
OUR COUNTRY- BUT OBVIOUSLY IF

01:54:31.331 --> 01:54:32.432
IT'S A CONTRACTOR THAT THE

01:54:32.498 --> 01:54:33.733
EMPLOYEE WANTS TO CONTINUE TO

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:35.068
WORK FOR THE EMPLOYEE WILL MOVE

01:54:35.134 --> 01:54:36.769
WITH THE CONTRACTOR. IF THE

01:54:36.836 --> 01:54:38.238
EMPLOYEE AND I THINK WHAT'S

01:54:38.304 --> 01:54:39.505
HARD FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND

01:54:39.572 --> 01:54:42.108

DYSFUNCTIONAL SYSTEM TO

02:31:07.158 --> 02:31:09.493
EVERYONE. A. M. THE THING ABOUT

02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:11.228
IT IS I'M FOR THE EQUITY IN THE

02:31:11.295 --> 02:31:13.330
SITUATION I GET THAT COMPLETELY

02:31:13.397 --> 02:31:15.699
BUT YOU WEREN'T GOOD TIMES WE

02:31:15.766 --> 02:31:17.168
JUST HAD THE BEST EDUCATION

02:31:17.234 --> 02:31:19.203
BUDGET THAT WE'VE HAD. MODERN

02:31:19.270 --> 02:31:21.272
TIMES THIS IS NOT SOMETHING

02:31:21.338 --> 02:31:23.741
THAT'S ON THE HORIZON BUT IF WE

02:31:23.808 --> 02:31:26.410
WERE TO HAVE AN EQUAL CHECKING

02:31:26.477 --> 02:31:28.679
OF THE EDUCATION BUDGET WHAT'S

02:31:28.746 --> 02:31:29.814
TO KEEP THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:31:29.880 --> 02:31:31.182
FROM DOING THE SAME THING OF

02:31:31.248 --> 02:31:33.451
JUST. ISSUING 15% OF THEIR

02:31:33.517 --> 02:31:34.952
CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES LAYOFF

02:31:35.019 --> 02:31:38.622
NOTICES AND THEN RESCINDED.

02:31:38.689 --> 02:31:39.223
MOST OF THEM WHEN THEY GET TO

02:31:39.290 --> 02:31:41.692
JULY. I REMEMBER THE TIMES WHEN

02:31:41.759 --> 02:31:43.260
OURS ARE CERTIFICATED OUR

02:31:43.327 --> 02:31:44.562
TEACHERS RECEIVE THOSE PINK

02:31:44.628 --> 02:31:46.464
SLIPS AS WE CALL THEM YEAH AND

02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:48.032
YOU'RE RIGHT- IT'S VERY

02:31:48.098 --> 02:31:51.635
UNNERVING. BUT AS- THE SAME AS

02:31:51.702 --> 02:31:53.404
DURING THAT TIME THE SAME THING

02:31:53.471 --> 02:31:54.572
WOULD HAPPEN KNOWN AS I TOLD

02:31:54.638 --> 02:31:55.973
THE STAKEHOLDERS MY MOTHER

02:31:56.040 --> 02:31:58.509
CALLS IT A HOSTESS WHENEVER

02:31:58.576 --> 02:31:59.210
THERE'S A CHANGE THERE WILL BE

02:31:59.276 --> 02:32:00.711
CHANGE IN THE LAW. THERE HAVE

02:32:00.778 --> 02:32:02.413
TO BE ADJUSTMENTS SO INITIALLY

02:32:02.480 --> 02:32:03.347
MAKE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

02:32:03.414 --> 02:32:06.517
GOING TO OVER. NOT NOTIFY THE

02:32:06.584 --> 02:32:08.452
CLASSIFIED BUT THE ADJUSTMENTS

02:32:08.519 --> 02:32:10.087
WILL BE MADE AND THEY WILL MAKE

02:32:10.154 --> 02:32:11.922
MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT

02:32:11.989 --> 02:32:13.557
WHO THEY SENT THE NOTICES TO

02:32:13.624 --> 02:32:14.525
JUST AS THEY DO WITH THE

02:32:14.592 --> 02:32:16.393
CERTIFICATED IT'S NOT GOING TO

02:32:16.460 --> 02:32:18.062
BE EVERYBODY THE GET SET. AND

02:32:18.128 --> 02:32:20.731
EVEN IF IN THE END IT THERE THE

02:32:20.798 --> 02:32:21.732
YEAH THEY THEY DON'T SEND THE

02:32:21.799 --> 02:32:24.201
NOTICES OUT. IF THE LEGISLATURE

02:32:24.268 --> 02:32:26.871
DOES NOT PROVIDE AT LEAST A 2%

02:32:26.937 --> 02:32:29.073
COLA INCREASE THE DISTRICTS CAN

02:32:29.139 --> 02:32:31.242
THEN SEND OUT A NOTICE IF THEY

02:32:31.308 --> 02:32:31.876
DIDN'T DO BEFORE MARCH

02:32:31.942 --> 02:32:33.677
FIFTEENTH. THERE ARE WAYS TO

02:32:33.744 --> 02:32:35.713
DEAL WITH THIS BUT IN THE END.

02:32:35.779 --> 02:32:36.747
WE SHOULD NOT BE BALANCING THE

02:32:36.814 --> 02:32:38.949
BUDGET ON THE BACKS OF THE

02:32:39.016 --> 02:32:41.018
CLASSIFIED. EVERYBODY SHOULD BE

02:32:41.085 --> 02:32:41.986
TREATED EQUALLY BECAUSE

02:32:42.052 --> 02:32:43.721
EVERYBODY IS IMPORTANT TO THE

02:32:43.787 --> 02:32:47.091
TEACHING. AND TO BE EDUCATING

02:32:47.157 --> 02:32:49.393
OUR STUDENTS. N. I. GET THAT.

02:32:49.460 --> 02:32:51.662
A. N. IT'S WHY I THINK N THE

02:32:51.729 --> 02:32:52.396
END I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS

02:32:52.463 --> 02:32:55.266
BILL. A BECAUSE OF THAT EQUITY

02:32:55.332 --> 02:32:57.101
IN IT AND IT WAS CLEAR IN MY

02:32:57.167 --> 02:32:59.803
OWN SITUATION THE CLASSIFIED.

02:32:59.870 --> 02:33:01.672
EMPLOYEES BORE THE BRUNT OF

02:33:01.739 --> 02:33:03.440
SOME OF THE HARDEST WORK

02:33:03.507 --> 02:33:06.176
WHETHER IT WAS. YOU KNOW JUST

02:33:06.243 --> 02:33:09.213
IN THE PAPER WORK WITH REGARD

02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:10.581
TO ENROLLMENT FOR GRADES OR- R.

02:33:10.648 --> 02:33:12.516
OR THE MORE TRADITIONAL THINGS

02:33:12.583 --> 02:33:14.451
OF DRIVING BUSES OR OR DOING

02:33:14.518 --> 02:33:17.388
OTHER STUFF. THE END IS THERE

02:33:17.454 --> 02:33:19.657
THE FLEXIBILITY ALSO THE ONE

02:33:19.723 --> 02:33:22.159
DIFFERENCE LAWS. IS WITH THE

02:33:22.226 --> 02:33:24.161
CERTIFICATED PERSONNEL THAT

02:33:24.228 --> 02:33:26.530
AFFECTS SCHOOL YEAR. AND IT WAS

02:33:26.597 --> 02:33:28.566
ALWAYS CLEAR. THAT YOU ARE NOT

02:33:28.632 --> 02:33:30.267
MONEY TO FUND THE TEACHERS FOR

02:33:30.334 --> 02:33:33.504
THE WHOLE YEAR OR NOT. BUT THEN

02:33:33.571 --> 02:33:35.606
ON THE CERTIFICATED SIDE SOME

02:33:35.673 --> 02:33:37.007
THINGS WERE EXACTLY THE SAME

02:33:37.074 --> 02:33:38.809
WAY IF YOU WERE IN SESSION GOOD

02:33:38.876 --> 02:33:40.411
SCHOOL BUSES FOR THE SECTION IF

02:33:40.477 --> 02:33:41.912
YOU WERE IN SESSION YOU NEEDED

02:33:41.979 --> 02:33:44.114
GREAT SUPPORT. BUT THERE WERE

02:33:44.181 --> 02:33:45.649
OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT

02:33:45.716 --> 02:33:47.518
GO PARTWAY THROUGH THE YEAR.

02:33:47.585 --> 02:33:48.586
THIS IS ALLOW FOR THE

02:33:48.652 --> 02:33:50.220
FLEXIBILITY OF SOMEBODY IS

02:33:50.287 --> 02:33:54.725
GRANT FUNDED OR SOMETHING THAT.

02:33:54.792 --> 02:33:55.292
IT GOES WITH THE LIFE OF THE

02:33:55.359 --> 02:33:56.894
GRANT. I'M LOOKING FOR THE

02:33:56.961 --> 02:33:59.163
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE I THINK

02:33:59.229 --> 02:34:00.631
THAT IF THERE STILL ISN'T AN

02:34:00.698 --> 02:34:01.865
ISSUE IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING

02:34:01.932 --> 02:34:03.500
THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. OUR

02:34:03.567 --> 02:34:04.702
THAT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS

02:34:04.768 --> 02:34:06.270
BROUGHT UP OTHER STAKEHOLDERS

02:34:06.337 --> 02:34:07.538
BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN LOOK AT

02:34:07.605 --> 02:34:09.340
THAT. WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT

02:34:09.406 --> 02:34:10.441
WE'RE NOT PUTTING AN EXTRA

02:34:10.507 --> 02:34:12.209
BURDEN ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:34:12.276 --> 02:34:13.077
THEY'RE HAVING TO DEAL WITH SO

02:34:13.143 --> 02:34:14.011
MANY OTHER THINGS IN YOUR

02:34:14.078 --> 02:34:15.679
RIGHT. THIS IS BEEN A REALLY

02:34:15.746 --> 02:34:17.014
GOOD YEAR FOR ALL OF OUR

02:34:17.081 --> 02:34:19.049
SCHOOLS IT'S NOT ALWAYS GOING

02:34:19.116 --> 02:34:25.289
TO BE THIS WAY. IS THAT. WHEN

02:34:25.356 --> 02:34:26.256
YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE OFF A

02:34:26.323 --> 02:34:27.791
LAYOFF NOTICE GIVE A LAYOFF

02:34:27.858 --> 02:34:29.560
NOTICE. SHOULD EVERYBODY

02:34:29.627 --> 02:34:31.562
RECEIVE IT EQUALLY OR SHOULD IT

02:34:31.629 --> 02:34:34.598
ONLY BE THE CERTIFICATED. AND

02:34:34.665 --> 02:34:36.867
CLASSIFIED TO BE LEFT TO WONDER

02:34:36.934 --> 02:34:39.069
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE OING TO

02:34:39.136 --> 02:34:41.238
BE LAID OFF WITHOUT HAVING THE

02:34:41.305 --> 02:34:43.007
DECENCY OF LETTING THEM KNOW

02:34:43.073 --> 02:34:44.742
THAT THEY MAY ALSO BE LAID OFF

02:34:44.808 --> 02:34:45.576
DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO

02:34:45.643 --> 02:34:47.111
BE LAID OFF BUT THEY MAY ALSO

02:34:47.177 --> 02:34:49.613
BE LAID OFF. IT'S JUST A NOTICE

02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:51.181
AND IF THEY DON'T RECEIVE THE

02:34:51.248 --> 02:34:52.383
NOTICE THEY KNOW THEIR JOB IS

02:34:52.449 --> 02:34:55.519
SECURE. BUT THEY'RE STILL THE

02:34:55.586 --> 02:34:57.454
IF THESE ONE OF THE COMMENTS

02:34:57.521 --> 02:34:58.589
THAT WAS MADE BY THE

02:34:58.656 --> 02:35:00.324
STAKEHOLDERS IS THAT WHAT IF

02:35:00.391 --> 02:35:01.358
THE BUDGET DOESN'T PROVIDE ALL

02:35:01.425 --> 02:35:02.926
THE MONEY WELL IF IT DOESN'T

02:35:02.993 --> 02:35:04.828
INCLUDE THAT 2% COLA. THE

02:35:04.895 --> 02:35:07.531
DISTRICT CAN STILL GIVE NOTICE

02:35:07.598 --> 02:35:09.900
AFTER MARCH FIFTEENTH. OKAY

02:35:09.967 --> 02:35:11.502
THANK YOU ARE PER SHIRT- RISA

02:35:11.568 --> 02:35:12.603

WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE WORKING

02:35:14.672 --> 02:35:17.174
IF. IF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

02:35:17.241 --> 02:35:19.243
OF MERGERS THIS BILL MOVES ON.

02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:21.111
THE ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU THANK

02:35:21.178 --> 02:35:27.151
YOU SENATOR. WILL BUTCHER.

02:35:27.217 --> 02:35:31.388
PALLETIZED THE QUESTION- THAT

02:35:31.455 --> 02:35:33.023
HAS IMPOSED AND SAYS STATES

02:35:33.090 --> 02:35:37.494
HERE- ONE ISSUE THAT I'VE HEARD

02:35:37.561 --> 02:35:39.029
FROM MY SCHOOL DISTRICT IS THAT

02:35:39.096 --> 02:35:40.597
THE TIMING OF PROVIDING ALL

02:35:40.664 --> 02:35:42.900
PRELIMINARY LAYOFF NOTICES TO

02:35:42.966 --> 02:35:44.635
EMPLOYEES ON MARCH FIFTEENTH

02:35:44.702 --> 02:35:46.770
TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED STAFF.

02:35:46.837 --> 02:35:48.639
AND THIS WOULD CREATE.

02:35:48.706 --> 02:35:50.708
ADMINISTRATIVE DIFFICULTIES

02:35:50.774 --> 02:35:51.842
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED MOVING THE

02:35:51.909 --> 02:35:54.344
TIMELINE FOR CLASSIFIED NOTICES

02:35:54.411 --> 02:35:57.214
BACKED BY A FEW MONTHS- TO

02:35:57.281 --> 02:35:59.383
BETTER ALIGN THE LAYOFF NOTICE

02:35:59.450 --> 02:35:59.983
PROCESS WITH THE STATE BUDGET

02:36:00.050 --> 02:36:02.720
PROCESS. IN THE PM AND THAT WAS

02:36:02.786 --> 02:36:04.521
SOMETHING THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS

02:36:04.588 --> 02:36:07.725
DID ADDRESS WITH US. WORK BEGAN

02:36:07.791 --> 02:36:09.693
TALKING ABOUT EQUITY FOR GOING

02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:10.728
TO GET THE NOTICE THEY ALREADY

02:36:10.794 --> 02:36:12.329
HAVE AN IDEA WHAT THEIR BUDGET

02:36:12.396 --> 02:36:14.431
IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. AND IF

02:36:14.498 --> 02:36:15.632
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS

02:36:15.699 --> 02:36:17.968
COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED THEN THEY

02:36:18.035 --> 02:36:19.369
KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THEY THEY

02:36:19.436 --> 02:36:21.572
ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE

02:36:21.638 --> 02:36:25.042
COLA INCREASE WAS TO DETERMINE

02:36:25.109 --> 02:36:25.642
WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN USE A

02:36:25.709 --> 02:36:28.746
LATER DATE. THE DISTRICTS

02:36:28.812 --> 02:36:30.180
FRANKLY DID NOT LIKE GIVING THE

02:36:30.247 --> 02:36:32.249
MARCH FIFTEENTH NOTICE TO THIS

02:36:32.316 --> 02:36:34.718
TO THE CERTIFICATED EITHER. FOR

02:36:34.785 --> 02:36:35.519
THE SAME REASON BECAUSE OF THE

02:36:35.586 --> 02:36:37.855
BUDGET. THEY HAVE AN IDEA WHAT

02:36:37.921 --> 02:36:39.156
THE BUDGET IS GOING TO LOOK

02:36:39.223 --> 02:36:40.657
LIKE WE'RE SAYING THAT THOSE

02:36:40.724 --> 02:36:42.593
EMPLOYEES JOBS WILL BE

02:36:42.659 --> 02:36:43.861
PROTECTED. THROUGH THE SCHOOL

02:36:43.927 --> 02:36:45.829
YEAR. PARENTS WERE SAYING SAME

02:36:45.896 --> 02:36:47.064
THINGS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE

02:36:47.131 --> 02:36:49.333
CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES. IF WE

02:36:49.399 --> 02:36:51.135
CHANGE THE DATE THEY'RE SAYING

02:36:51.201 --> 02:36:53.070
AS I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION.

02:36:53.137 --> 02:36:54.872
BUT KEEP THE MARCH FIFTEENTH

02:36:54.938 --> 02:36:56.173
FOR THE CERTIFICATED FOR THE

02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:58.075
ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS.

02:36:58.142 --> 02:37:01.111
BUT FOR THE CLASSIFIED LET'S

02:37:01.178 --> 02:37:01.979
PICK A DATE IN JUNE OR JULY.

02:37:02.045 --> 02:37:03.147
THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:37:03.213 --> 02:37:06.049
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A ONE DATE

02:37:06.116 --> 02:37:07.317
SO THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS

02:37:07.384 --> 02:37:08.352
ABLE TO LOOK AT THEIR ENTIRE

02:37:08.418 --> 02:37:10.354
BUDGET. AND DETERMINE WHAT IS

02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:12.156
THE PERCENTAGE OF THE LAYOFFS

02:37:12.222 --> 02:37:14.558
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO AND

02:37:14.625 --> 02:37:15.058
THEN SEND OUT THE PROPER

02:37:15.125 --> 02:37:24.134
NOTICES. IT IS THINKING. AS A

02:37:24.201 --> 02:37:28.372
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER RIGHT NOW.

02:37:28.438 --> 02:37:29.706
AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE NOTED

02:37:29.773 --> 02:37:31.241
THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:37:31.308 --> 02:37:33.243
OPPOSITION IT'S THE SCHOOL

02:37:33.310 --> 02:37:35.012
DISTRICTS THAT ARE OPPOSING

02:37:35.078 --> 02:37:37.181
IT'S NOT THE EMPLOYEES IT'S NOT

02:37:37.247 --> 02:37:39.049
THE CERTIFICATED TO THE CSEA

02:37:39.116 --> 02:37:42.319

ADJUSTMENTS. ONCE THEY

RECOGNIZE WHAT THE LAWYERS THEY

02:37:52.462 --> 02:37:53.897
WILL MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS AND I

02:37:53.964 --> 02:37:54.832
KNOW THEY WILL MAKE THE RIGHT

02:37:54.898 --> 02:37:56.667
DECISIONS AND SEND THE PROPER

02:37:56.733 --> 02:37:58.836
NOTICES TO THE PROPER NUMBER OF

02:37:58.902 --> 02:38:00.571

THINK THIS IS LONG OVERDUE AND

02:38:28.398 --> 02:38:30.868
I THINK IF THERE WAS A TIME TO

02:38:30.934 --> 02:38:32.903
DO IT THIS WOULD BE THE TIME

02:38:32.970 --> 02:38:34.705
NOT TO SAY THAT IT RESOLVES ALL

02:38:34.771 --> 02:38:36.473
THE ISSUES AND I THINK YOU CALL

02:38:36.540 --> 02:38:38.609
THAT OUT OF THINGS- ASSEMBLY

02:38:38.675 --> 02:38:40.177

PROBABLY IN WHAT IT WE JUST

02:38:57.027 --> 02:38:58.462
HANDLE THE REST OF THIS IF WE

02:38:58.528 --> 02:39:00.197
CAN YOU KNOW AND TRY TO GET

02:39:00.264 --> 02:39:01.498

02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:05.135
THAT EVERYBODY'S ON PINS AND

02:39:05.202 --> 02:39:07.070
NEEDLES ABOUT TWO MONTHS AFTER

02:39:07.137 --> 02:39:07.771
THE LEAD OFF TO THE RACES ARE

02:39:07.838 --> 02:39:10.274
DUE AND THEN. ENOUGH TO SCARE

02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:11.208
THE HELL OUT OF PEOPLE YOU GOT

02:39:11.275 --> 02:39:12.843
TO TURN AROUND IN MANY CASES

02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:13.610
AND CERTAINLY SOME OF THOSE

02:39:13.677 --> 02:39:15.612
LAYOFFS DECK PUT IN ON OFFENSE

02:39:15.679 --> 02:39:16.713
SO MANY DISTRICTS AND SO MANY

02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:18.382
YEARS CERTAINLY IN THE YEARS I

02:39:18.448 --> 02:39:20.584
WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD. AND

02:39:20.651 --> 02:39:22.486
MINISTERS CAME BACK AND SAID

02:39:22.552 --> 02:39:24.855
YOU KNOW THEY DON'T SAY IT THIS

02:39:24.922 --> 02:39:27.357
WAY BUT HISTORY JUST KIDDING WE

02:39:27.424 --> 02:39:28.325
DON'T REALLY HAVE TO DO THAT

02:39:28.392 --> 02:39:29.393
NOW WILL BY THAT TIME YOU'VE

TOUGH TIMES TOUGHER TIMES THAT

02:39:36.633 --> 02:39:38.435
WE'RE IN NOW. SO I THINK

02:39:38.502 --> 02:39:39.603
THERE'S MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO

02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:41.738
BE DONE IN THIS AREA I DON'T

02:39:41.805 --> 02:39:43.707
THINK EVERYONE WAS IN A

02:39:43.774 --> 02:39:45.776
POSITION TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW I

02:39:45.842 --> 02:39:48.345
THINK THIS BILL IT'S ENOUGH

02:39:48.412 --> 02:39:50.213
DEFINITELY DOES SOMETHING

02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:52.215
IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF A HUGE

02:39:52.282 --> 02:39:53.951
STEP FORWARD SAYING WILL BEFORE

WE ADDRESS ANY OTHER ISSUES

02:39:55.519 --> 02:39:56.987
HERE LET'S GET TO PARITY FIRST

02:39:57.054 --> 02:39:59.022

02:39:59.089 --> 02:39:59.923
KNOW HOW WE DEAL WITH THE REST

02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:01.558
OF THE FALL OUT. OF THAT WE'VE

02:40:01.625 --> 02:40:02.659
BEEN DEALING WITH FOR SO MANY

02:40:02.726 --> 02:40:04.861
YEARS IN TERMS OF HARDSHIP ON

02:40:04.928 --> 02:40:05.963
EMPLOYEES IN ADMINISTRATORS AND

02:40:06.029 --> 02:40:10.534
SCHOOL BOARDS. AND SCHOOL

02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:11.034
BOARDS HATE TO MAKE THAT

02:40:11.101 --> 02:40:11.802
DECISION- NO THAT THERE'S A

02:40:11.868 --> 02:40:14.237
GOOD CHANCE THAT THEY MAY NOT

02:40:14.304 --> 02:40:15.272
YOU KNOW THEY MAY NOT HAVE TO

02:40:15.339 --> 02:40:16.306

02:40:27.084 --> 02:40:28.151

STEP TOWARD TRYING TO GET TO A

02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:32.189

AT HIGH RISK. SO THIS

02:42:24.768 --> 02:42:26.903
LEGISLATION ASSEMBLY BILL

02:42:26.970 --> 02:42:27.504

PROTECTING FARMING AGRICULTURAL

02:42:30.540 --> 02:42:33.076
WORKERS FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE AN

02:42:33.143 --> 02:42:33.543
UNHEALTHY QUALITY AIR

02:42:33.610 --> 02:42:37.147
CONDITIONS- LAST YEAR THE

02:42:37.214 --> 02:42:38.148
COMBINATION OF A GLOBAL

02:42:38.215 --> 02:42:40.317
PANDEMIC THE- PRESIDENT NUMBER

02:42:40.383 --> 02:42:41.751
OF WILDFIRES WE EXPERIENCE TO

02:42:41.818 --> 02:42:43.253
PUT ENORMOUS STRAIN ON THE

AVAILABILITY OF PP AND MADE IT

02:42:44.554 --> 02:42:46.323
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. FOR

MASKS FOR THEIR WORKERS SO THIS

02:42:52.896 --> 02:42:55.832
pFIRST IT WOULD ENSURE THE

02:42:55.899 --> 02:42:57.000
STATE'S STOCKPILE AND NINETY

02:42:57.067 --> 02:42:59.102

02:43:16.486 --> 02:43:17.420
IT WOULD REQUIRE A CULTURE TO

SENATE SEAT THIS IS ONE OF THE

03:10:25.947 --> 03:10:28.049
ISSUES I WAS ASKED ABOUT ALL

03:10:28.116 --> 03:10:29.551
OVER THE PLACE THERE WAS REAL

03:10:29.618 --> 03:10:31.419
INTEREST ON THE CENTRAL COAST

03:10:31.486 --> 03:10:34.656
IN. IN HAVING A PUBLIC BANK AND

03:10:34.723 --> 03:10:37.125
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE STEPS

WERE HI SALUTE THE AUTHOR FOR

03:10:39.694 --> 03:10:41.196
SCALING BACK IN THE SENSE THAT

03:10:41.263 --> 03:10:43.098
THIS IS A MARKET ANALYSIS AND

03:10:43.165 --> 03:10:45.333
THIS REALLY MAKES THE CASE IN

IS FORTY YEARS AGO I WAS PART

03:10:49.971 --> 03:10:52.040
OF A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE.

03:10:52.107 --> 03:10:54.242
THAT HAD A SIMILAR ASPIRATION

03:10:54.309 --> 03:10:55.644
AND SO WE FROM THE COMMUNITY

03:10:55.710 --> 03:10:58.013
DEVELOPMENT CREDIT UNION AND

03:10:58.079 --> 03:11:01.149

SUPPORT FOR THIS SO I THINK

03:11:21.670 --> 03:11:22.871

SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BEING HERE

03:15:49.971 --> 03:15:54.776

STATE A STATE AGENCIES I HAVE

03:16:03.585 --> 03:16:05.820
SEVERE CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING

MEAN THIS IS WHAT THIS IS WHAT

03:17:49.290 --> 03:17:50.525
MAKES A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

03:17:50.592 --> 03:17:51.192
WORK IS THAT WE CAN HAVE A

03:17:51.259 --> 03:17:53.461
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION- BUT IT

03:17:53.528 --> 03:17:54.929
HELPS TO MAKE IT A BETTER BILL

03:17:54.996 --> 03:17:55.830
BECAUSE I HAVE TO TRUST THE

03:17:55.897 --> 03:17:56.731
QUESTIONS IN PREVIOUS

03:17:56.798 --> 03:17:58.933
COMMITTEES- THERE WERE- TOUGH

03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:01.469
QUESTIONS REGARDING- WHETHER

03:18:01.536 --> 03:18:02.670
THIS MAKES SENSE WITH IT WAS

03:18:02.737 --> 03:18:04.239
NEEDED. AND EVEN TO SOME OF

03:18:04.305 --> 03:18:05.540
YOUR QUESTIONS I MIGHT POINT

03:18:05.607 --> 03:18:06.841
OUT OF THE MARKET ANALYSIS WILL

03:18:06.908 --> 03:18:08.743
WE SAY YOU KNOW THAT IT AND

03:18:08.810 --> 03:18:10.712
SECTION SEE THAT ANNOUNCES THAT

THE CAL OF THE POPULATION OF

03:18:11.779 --> 03:18:12.847
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE UNBANKED

03:18:12.914 --> 03:18:14.315
AND THE REASON FOR WHICH THEY

03:18:14.382 --> 03:18:16.985
ARE ON BANK IN THE RESULT- THAT

03:18:17.051 --> 03:18:19.187
THAT. THE SOME OF THE- INDUSTRY

03:18:19.254 --> 03:18:20.855
TO YOU SUGGESTED IS DOING IN

03:18:20.922 --> 03:18:21.823
THE IN A PROPER JOB I DON'T

03:18:21.889 --> 03:18:23.224
BELIEVE SO BUT IT MAY RESULT IN

03:18:23.291 --> 03:18:24.192
THAT BUT IT ALSO MEANS ON THE

03:18:24.259 --> 03:18:25.193
FACT THAT THEY'RE NOT IN THE

03:18:25.260 --> 03:18:26.694
ANSWERS WOULD BE QUESTION-

03:18:26.761 --> 03:18:28.162
CERTAINLY QUESTIONS WOULD BE

03:18:28.229 --> 03:18:28.663
ANSWERED WITH A MARKET

03:18:28.730 --> 03:18:30.798
ANALYSIS. WE TAKE A LOOK AT

03:18:30.865 --> 03:18:31.499
OTHER THINGS LIKE THE

03:18:31.566 --> 03:18:32.567
AVAILABILITY OF PARTICIPATING

03:18:32.634 --> 03:18:34.102
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHETHER

03:18:34.168 --> 03:18:35.837
THIS WORK COULD BE DONE OR NOT-

03:18:35.903 --> 03:18:37.005
DENOUNCES OF ADVANTAGES R

03:18:37.071 --> 03:18:38.506
DISADVANTAGES COMPARED TO THE

03:18:38.573 --> 03:18:40.041
PRIVATE SECTOR ALTERNATIVES SO

03:18:40.108 --> 03:18:41.576
WE LOOK TOWARDS DOING THAT BUT

03:18:41.643 --> 03:18:43.177
ALSO I WOULD SAY THAT I WANT TO

03:18:43.244 --> 03:18:44.012
BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE NOT

03:18:44.078 --> 03:18:47.115
ESTABLISHING. A STATEWIDE BANK-

03:18:47.181 --> 03:18:48.883
OR A DEPARTMENT RATHER A

03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:51.552
PLATFORM- THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN

03:18:51.619 --> 03:18:57.492
TO WORK- CAN. WE MAY DISAGREE

03:18:57.558 --> 03:18:58.126
RIGHT BUT LET BUT- CAL SAVE. IT

03:18:58.192 --> 03:18:58.760
A PLOT. THAT LOOK VERY SIMILAR

03:18:58.826 --> 03:18:59.794
LIKE THIS WHERE THERE IS A

03:18:59.861 --> 03:19:01.329
PUBLIC PLATFORM. WHERE PEOPLE

03:19:01.396 --> 03:19:03.064
CAN SAVE THEIR DOLLARS. AND

03:19:03.131 --> 03:19:05.800
THE- AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY IS

03:19:05.867 --> 03:19:07.001
THE BACKSIDE OF IT THAT MANAGES

03:19:07.068 --> 03:19:08.603
THE DOLLARS AND IN IN THE WAY

03:19:08.670 --> 03:19:10.338
THAT WE'RE LOOKING- IN THE

03:19:10.405 --> 03:19:12.040
STEPS IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

03:19:12.106 --> 03:19:14.375
BANKING- OPTION ACT WHICH- IS

03:19:14.442 --> 03:19:16.744
IN EFFECT- CAL BANK SO. I WOULD

03:19:16.811 --> 03:19:18.112
SAY THAT THERE IS THAT THERE IS

03:19:18.179 --> 03:19:19.447
A NEED AND- I WANT TO BE VERY

03:19:19.514 --> 03:19:21.949
CLEAR. THAT WHAT I IT WHAT

03:19:22.016 --> 03:19:24.752
WE'RE TRYING TO DO- IN- IS

03:19:24.819 --> 03:19:27.055
ESTABLISHED THIS. FOR THE SAKE.

03:19:27.121 --> 03:19:29.090
OF PEOPLE NOT FOR THE SAKE OF

03:19:29.157 --> 03:19:30.758
PROFIT. AND I WANNA BE VERY

03:19:30.825 --> 03:19:32.327
CLEAR THE BIG BANKS ARE DOING

03:19:32.393 --> 03:19:34.128
THIS IN A PROVIDED SERVICES.

03:19:34.195 --> 03:19:37.465
BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S- IT'S A FOR

03:19:37.532 --> 03:19:39.701
PROFIT. AND IT'S FOR WALL

03:19:39.767 --> 03:19:40.668
STREET. AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

03:19:40.735 --> 03:19:42.670
DO THAT. MUCH LIKE THE WORK OF

03:19:42.737 --> 03:19:44.372
COMMUNITY BANKS. MUCH LIKE THE

03:19:44.439 --> 03:19:46.808
WORK OF CREDIT UNIONS- WE ARE

03:19:46.874 --> 03:19:48.976
ALSO LOOKING TO ESTABLISH. THE

03:19:49.043 --> 03:19:51.245
ABILITY FOR PEOPLE. TO BE BANG

03:19:51.312 --> 03:19:53.081
TO UNDERBANKED OR UNBANKED. AND

03:19:53.147 --> 03:19:57.118
WEBER WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IT

03:19:57.185 --> 03:19:59.153
IS ESSENTIAL- TO HAVE A SYSTEM.

03:19:59.220 --> 03:20:01.255
A FINANCIAL SYSTEM THAT CHARGES

03:20:01.322 --> 03:20:03.424
NO PENALTIES. NO FEES. NO

03:20:03.491 --> 03:20:05.159
OVERDRAFT PROTECTION I'M SORRY

03:20:05.226 --> 03:20:06.561
NO OVERDRAFT FEES AND WE JUST

03:20:06.627 --> 03:20:07.795
SAW SOME OF THE BIGGEST BANKS

03:20:07.862 --> 03:20:09.197
MAKE HISTORIC AMOUNTS OF

03:20:09.263 --> 03:20:11.199
DOLLARS ON OVERDRAFT FEES.

03:20:11.265 --> 03:20:12.100
DURING THE TIME THAT PEOPLE ARE

03:20:12.166 --> 03:20:14.602
SUFFERING- INSTANCE SO WHAT I

03:20:14.669 --> 03:20:16.404
WOULD ARGUE. IS THAT THAT I

03:20:16.471 --> 03:20:18.005
WOULD CONTINUE TO WANT TO TALK

03:20:18.072 --> 03:20:19.607
TO YOU BUT IT'S VERY. VERY

03:20:19.674 --> 03:20:20.842
CLEAR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

03:20:20.908 --> 03:20:22.110
AS A COMPARED TO THE MISSION.

03:20:22.176 --> 03:20:23.277
THAT A BIG BANK IS TRYING TO

03:20:23.344 --> 03:20:24.879
DO. AND THEY HAD AND I WOULD

03:20:24.946 --> 03:20:26.114
ARGUE THAT THERE'S A NECESSARY

03:20:26.180 --> 03:20:27.882
MISSION. TO COMPLEMENT THE GOOD

03:20:27.949 --> 03:20:29.016
WORK THE COMMUNITY BANKS AND

03:20:29.083 --> 03:20:30.952

CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ACT.

03:20:37.658 --> 03:20:39.761
AND REALLY CAN'T SEE MORE THAN

03:20:39.827 --> 03:20:41.629
