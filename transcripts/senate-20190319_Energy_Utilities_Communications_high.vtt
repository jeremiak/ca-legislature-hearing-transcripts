00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:09.128
DEMAND LOAD.

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:12.932
IS DEPARTING FROM IT IS PROBABLY

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:13.766
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR.

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:15.668
AS OF SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:16.602
EIGHTEEN THERE WERE THIRTY SEVEN

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.237
LOAD SERVING ENTITIES ALL THOSE

00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:19.305
DIFFERENT PROVIDERS OF

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:20.606
ELECTRICITY UNDER PSG

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:22.942
JURISDICTION SERVING CUSTOMERS.

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:25.444
COLLUDING THE THREE BIG I USED

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:28.114
TO SMALLER WHEN. NINETEEN CLEAN

00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:29.015
COMPETITIVE COMMUNITY

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:31.384
AGGREGATORS AND FOURTEEN

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.052
ELECTRICITY SERVICE PROVIDERS

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.987
THOSE DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS TO

00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:38.424
GO BACK 220-002-0001 ENERGY

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:40.059
CRISIS.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.829
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS NOT A DE

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:45.398
REGULATION THAT WAS PLANNED?

00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:47.166
BY THE LEGISLATURE AND HAD

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:49.168
CONSISTENCY BUT IT'S A DE

00:07:49.235 --> 00:07:51.204
REGULATION FROM THE GROUND UP AS

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.906
A RESULT OF MANY CHANGES AND AND

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.575
DECISIONS AND LEGISLATIVE

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.276
DIRECTIONS OF THE LAST TWENTY

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:58.344
YEARS.

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.546
MY FEAR IS THAT UNLESS WE PUT

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:02.615
SOME --

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.250
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE.

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:05.985
OR COME UP WITH THE CONSISTENT

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:08.120
MODEL THEN WE COULD DRIFT BACK

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:10.656
INTO SOME OF THE SAME KINDS OF

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:14.961
OF PROBLEMS THAT WE SAW.

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:16.062
THOUSAND ONE WITH THAT DE

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:18.231
REGULATION THAT WAS EASY FOR THE

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:20.933
LEGISLATURE REVERSE THIS WILL BE

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.201
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE

00:08:22.268 --> 00:08:24.036
INVESTMENT MADE BY CUSTOMERS AND

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:26.339
A WHOLE RANGE OF OF OTHER

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:27.773
PATTERNS THAT ARE DEVELOPED.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.009
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS FRAGMENTED

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:31.410
DECISION MAKING WERE MANY

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:34.113
INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS TONY UP TO

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.149
ADD UP TO THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE --

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:37.917
WE'RE SEEING --

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:40.586
POORLY COORDINATED PROCUREMENT.

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:42.021
THAT DOESN'T --

00:08:42.088 --> 00:08:43.956
MAKE SURE THE SPECIFIC RESOURCES

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:45.524
ARE IN PLACE TO PROVIDE

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:47.126
RELIABILITY THE GRAD.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.661
AND THERE'S NO PLAN FOR THE

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:50.930
POSSIBILITY OF FAILURE OF ANY

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:52.598
THESE NEW PLAYERS.

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:54.400
IN THE MARKET PLACE AS A RESULT

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:56.869
OF TURBULENCE AND IN THE LARGER

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:59.538
ELECTRICITY MARKETS AND OTHER

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:01.474
KINDS OF ON TOWARD EVENTS.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.842
SO I A QUICKLY OUTLINED SOME OF

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:04.644
WHAT WE SAW IS WE STUDIED OTHER

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:05.778
STATES.

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.079
AS WE STARTED TO SEE THIS

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:10.249
PATTERN EMERGING NOT JUST IN ONE

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:11.918
CASE BUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:13.452
BUSINESS MODELS TECHNOLOGIES

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.353
TOGETHER.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.489
WE STARTED A STUDY WHICH WE CALL

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:18.724
CALIFORNIA CUSTOMER CHOICE WE

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:20.726
TRY TO BE AGNOSTIC AS TO THE

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:23.362
TECHNOLOGY OR THE BUSINESS MODEL.

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:25.364
BUT WE ARE SEEING SOME PATTERNS

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:26.565
THE THAT WE THINK DESERVE

00:09:26.632 --> 00:09:29.735
ATTENTION --

00:09:29.802 --> 00:09:31.270
AS PART OF THEIR PROJECT AGAIN

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:32.838
WE LOOKED AT FOR OTHER

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.974
JURISDICTIONS TO EVALUATE THEIR

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:36.542
DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OR

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:38.210
OF A COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:40.346
FRAMEWORK THAT HAVE ENABLED THEM

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.248
TO HAVE A HIGH PENETRATION OF

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:44.183
CUSTOMER CHOICE.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.551
IN ELECTRICITY SERVICE AND

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:47.553
THAT'S JUST ELECTRICITY SERVICE

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.487
IT DOES NOT --

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:50.756
AND GENERALLY INVOLVE THE IN THE

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:53.426
A THEY DID NATURAL MONOPOLY OF

00:09:53.492 --> 00:09:55.127
WIRES AND POLES.

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:56.429
YOU DO NOT HAVE CUSTOMERS YET

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:58.164
OUT THERE WANTING TO OWN THEIR

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.432
OLD WOODEN POLE.

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:01.367
OR SEGMENT OF WIRE THAN CHARGING

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.936
THEIR NEIGHBORS TO USE.

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:05.571
THAT'S STILL A MONOPOLY.

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:07.106
NONE OF THESE ARE EXACTLY

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:09.508
IDENTICAL TO CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:10.676
MUCH MORE PATTERNS.

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:12.311
AND PROTECTIONS IN TERMS OF

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:14.547
MAKING SURE THAT ELECTRICITY IS

00:10:14.613 --> 00:10:16.382
AFFORDABLE TO ALL CUSTOMERS.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:17.883
WE ARE REALLY FOR OFF MUCH

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.552
FURTHER DOWN THE PATHWAY OF D.

00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:21.454
CARBONIZATION OF THE ELECTRIC

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.723
INDUSTRY THAN OTHER STATES.

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:25.458
AND WE HAVE BE BECAUSE OF

00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:27.426
LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION VERY FIRM

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:29.862
AND FAST RULES ABOUT RELIABILITY

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:32.765
CORD TO CALL RESOURCE ADEQUACY.

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:34.333
SO IN NEW YORK.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.902
CUSTOMERS CAN ENTER INTO.

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:40.706
AGREEMENTS WITH WITH ENERGY S.

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:41.073
GOES.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.908
THEN THEY GET THEIR ENERGY FROM

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:44.343
THOSE COMPANIES SERVICE THERE

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.381
WERE SEVENTY OF THEM AS OF TWO

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:48.948
THOUSAND SIXTEEN BUT UNLIKE

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:50.750
CALIFORNIA.

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:53.119
THERE'S A SINGLE STATE AGENCY

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:54.520
THAT DOES ALL THE PROCUREMENT

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:56.756
NICER TO KNOW NEW YORK STATE --

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:59.325
ENERGY RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT

00:10:59.392 --> 00:10:59.992
AGENCY.

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:02.795
AND THEY DO THEY DO PARTICULARLY

00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:05.331
THE CLEAN ENERGY PROCUREMENT.

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:08.534
THE UTILITIES ONLY RUN THE WIRES

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:09.835
AND POLES AS A MATTER OF FACT

00:11:09.902 --> 00:11:10.936
THEY SEPARATE THE BULK

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:12.505
TRANSMISSION FROM THE LOW

00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:15.241
VOLTAGE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:16.776
MORE RECENTLY THEY'VE TRIED TO

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:18.444
STIMULATE INVESTMENT IN

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.679
TECHNOLOGIES THAT WOULD COMPETE

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:22.048
WITH SOME OF THOSE DISTRIBUTION

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:23.549
SERVICES.

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:25.184
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE DOING

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:27.286
HEARING CALIFORNIA --

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:29.055
HOWEVER THEY'RE THEY'RE STILL

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:30.956
TRAILING I THINK SOME OF THE

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:32.792
SUCCESSES WE'VE SEEN.

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:34.960
SO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE THEIR

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:36.662
WORKS VERY WELL FOR LARGE

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:37.196
INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:39.098
CUSTOMERS THE RESIDENTIAL AND

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:40.599
SMALL CUSTOMERS.

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:41.734
IN KONA --

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:43.869
INCLUDING LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:46.072
ARE ARE OVERPAYING ACCORDING TO

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:48.541
WHAT WE FOUND.

00:11:48.607 --> 00:11:50.276
ILLINOIS' ILLINOIS' HAS A

00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:51.510
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MODEL THEY

00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:52.244
HAVE.

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:54.914
A VERY LARGE INCUMBENT.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.782
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES BUT

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:58.984
THEY'VE ALLOWED COMMUNITIES TO

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:00.586
CREATE WHAT THEY CALL A

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:02.455
MUNICIPAL ENERGY AGGREGATORS

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:05.891
SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO OUR OUR

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:06.992
CLEAN A COMPETITIVE COMMUNITY

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:08.194
AGGREGATORS.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.062
EXCEPT YOU HAVE TO STAY WITH

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:12.731
THAT HERE.

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:15.301
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHES THE

00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:16.669
THE MUNICIPAL --

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:19.004
ENERGY AGGREGATOR AND YOU ARE

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:22.475
STUCK WITH IT FOR A YEAR --

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:24.977
THERE'S A RATE THE YOU HAVE TO

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:27.113
BE THAT'S ACTUALLY --

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:28.747
BASED ON THE THE THE LECTURE

00:12:28.814 --> 00:12:31.350
CITY RATES SET BY ALL THE OTHER

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:31.951
YOU.

00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:33.619
REGULATED UTILITIES.

00:12:33.686 --> 00:12:35.554
AND THAT WAY THE RETAIL

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:37.690
PROVIDERS KNOW WHO THEY HAVE TO

00:12:37.756 --> 00:12:40.426
TO TO BE --

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:42.228
FIXED --

00:12:42.294 --> 00:12:43.896
ROUGHLY ONE THIRD TO HALF A

00:12:43.963 --> 00:12:45.264
CUSTOMERS WERE SERVED BY A

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:47.900
MUNICIPAL ENERGY AGGREGATORS.

00:12:47.967 --> 00:12:50.202
BUT THEY FOUND IT WAS HARD TO

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.238
ACTUALLY BEAT THE PRICE OF THE

00:12:52.304 --> 00:12:53.839
INCUMBENT.

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:55.574
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES SO

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:58.310
PEOPLE ARE NOW STARTING TO FOLD

00:12:58.377 --> 00:12:59.778
UP THOSE MUNICIPAL ENERGY

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:02.414
AGGREGATORS AND GO BACK TO THE

00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:04.984
TO THE TO THE DOMINANT UTILITIES.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.019
THAT STATE ALSO HAS A SEPARATE

00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:08.554
CENTRAL PROCUREMENT AGENCY THE

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:09.889
ILLINOIS' POWER AGENCY WHICH

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:10.990
COURTNEY'S PLANNING AND

00:13:11.056 --> 00:13:12.791
PROCUREMENT FOR THE STATE'S

00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:14.827
ELECTRICITY MARKET.

00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:16.362
SO OF THOSE CENTRALIZED

00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:17.329
PROCUREMENT --

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:18.964
PLANNING PROVIDES CUSTOMERS

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:20.666
ASSURANCE FOR RELIABILITY EVEN

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:23.369
WITH RETAIL CHOICE.

00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:26.105
BUT IT ALSO SETS THE PRICE.

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:27.306
AND THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY HAS TO

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:27.606
BE.

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:29.341
THEY'RE NOT FOCUSED ON DE

00:13:29.408 --> 00:13:31.510
CARBONIZATION.

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:34.346
TEXAS TEXAS IS THE PLACE WHERE

00:13:34.413 --> 00:13:35.814
THEY JUST RIP THE BANDAID OFF

00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:38.117
COMPETITION RETAIL COMPETITION

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:39.218
IS THE KEY TO MARKET --

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:40.920
STRUCTURE.

00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:43.589
THEIR RETAIL ENERGY PROVIDERS.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.791
AND THEY ALSO HAVE COMMUNITY

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:47.660
CHOICE AGGREGATORS IS JUST

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:49.695
STARTING UP THERE.

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:51.797
IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE ONE OF THOSE

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:53.432
RETAIL ENERGY PROVIDERS YOU'RE

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.234
NOT IN ONE OF THE THE NEWLY

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:57.069
FORMING CCA'S.

00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:58.804
THEM AND THE STATE.

00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:00.906
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF

ENERGY PROVIDER --

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:10.416
THERE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY.

00:14:10.482 --> 00:14:11.850
DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH

00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:13.118
GENERATORS ARE PARTICIPATING

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:15.087
WHOLE SO MARKETS THEY HAVE WHOLE

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:17.590
GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS IN THE END

00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:21.660
THEY NEGOTIATE A A RATE.

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:23.229
WITH THE RETAIL PROVIDERS THAT'S

00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:24.830
HOW THEY'RE CCA'S WORKED THE

00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:26.265
RETAIL ENERGY PROVIDERS ON THE

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:26.699
HAND.

00:14:26.765 --> 00:14:27.900
ARE JUST STRAIGHT OUT

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:31.170
COMPETITIVE BASED ONLY ON PRICE

00:14:31.237 --> 00:14:32.972
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY.

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:35.441
ANY ANY REAL GOALS TOWARDS

00:14:35.507 --> 00:14:37.610
RENEWABLES TO SPEAK OF THEY'RE

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:39.211
VERY CHEAP RATES.

00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:40.346
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY PUBLIC

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:43.349
GOODS CHARGE LIKE OUR LIKE --

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:47.286
CONSUMER ACCESS --

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:49.121
TO TO CHEAP ELECTRICITY OR AT

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:51.457
THE ENERGY SAVINGS ASSISTANCE

00:14:51.523 --> 00:14:53.292
PROGRAMS.

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:54.393
OR A MEDICAL BASS LINE.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.794
THERE YOU'RE JUST DEPENDENT ON

00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:56.829
THE MARKET.

00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:57.429
THEY DON'T HAVE A ENERGY

00:14:57.496 --> 00:14:59.732
EFFICIENCY --

00:14:59.798 --> 00:15:01.267
SUBSIDIZED OR AIDED BY THE

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:03.435
UTILITIES --

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:05.704
SO THEY HAVE HIGH USAGE WHAT

00:15:05.771 --> 00:15:07.506
WHAT THEY DO WHEN THEY HIT THE

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:09.008
SPOT MARKETS WIN.

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:11.143
THE RETAIL PROVIDERS DON'T HAVE

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.245
ENOUGH ELECTRICITY CURRENTLY

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:14.513
UNDER CONTRACT.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.583
IS THOSE PRICES GO SKY HIGH.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.185
SO AS A RESULT.

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:21.820
MOST CUSTOMERS ARE KIND OF BONTA

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:23.255
UNBUNDLED AND DISAGGREGATED

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:24.723
AMONGST ALL THESE OLD ENERGY

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.158
PROVIDERS BUT THEY GET THEIR

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:28.027
THEIR WIRES AND POLES SERVICES

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:30.362
FROM FROM THESE TRANSMISSION AND

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:31.864
DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.832
SO IF A COMPANY OF ONE OF THOSE

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:36.402
RETAIL PROVIDERS FAILS SOMETIMES

00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:37.870
HAPPEN THE IS GET REASSIGNED TO

00:15:37.936 --> 00:15:39.238
ANOTHER --

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:41.807
RETAIL ENERGY PROVIDER --

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:43.475
THIS IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:45.477
GREAT BRITAIN WHERE CUSTOMERS

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:48.080
REALLY DID NOT GO OUT AND LOOK

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:49.715
VERY MUCH.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.917
AT WHAT THE DIFFERENT PRICES FOR

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:54.320
SO BECAUSE OF THIS BOTH NEW YORK.

00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:55.654
WHICH HAD THE SAME PROBLEM IN

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:57.856
TEXAS ARE CREATING WEBSITES TO

00:15:57.923 --> 00:16:00.826
COMPARE PRICES TO MAKE IT EASIER.

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:02.394
FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AROUND SEE

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:02.928
WHO CAN GIVEN THE CHEAPEST

00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:04.029
PRICES.

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:05.964
AGAIN RELIABILITY IS MAINTAINED

00:16:06.031 --> 00:16:09.034
BY WHEN THE PRICES GO HIGH AND

00:16:09.101 --> 00:16:12.304
AND LET THE MARKET DECIDE --

00:16:12.371 --> 00:16:14.039
GREAT BRITAIN IS PROBABLY THE

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:16.875
MOST COMPLICATED --

00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:18.110
CUSTOMERS CAN CHOOSE THEIR

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:19.812
ELECTORATE SO I COULD SERVICE

00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:21.814
PROVIDER BUT PROBABLY 80% OF ALL

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.415
CUSTOMERS IN ENGLAND GO WITH THE

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:25.517
TOP SIX PROVIDERS WHO ARE THE

00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:27.586
OLD DOMINANT ELECTRICITY

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:29.521
COMPANIES.

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:32.191
OUR CUSTOMERS. TO USE.

00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:36.395
PRICE COMPARISON WEBSITES --

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:38.063
DAME THE STATE WOULD LAST I

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.398
HEARD THEY ARE STARTING TO SEE

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:41.200
COMMUNITY AGGREGATOR STARTING TO

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:43.102
FORM A LITTLE BIT MORE FOCUSED

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:45.904
ON DE CARBONIZATION.

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:47.606
THERE'S NO PREDETERMINED

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.908
PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT QUIRK IN

00:16:49.975 --> 00:16:51.543
CASE OF FAILURE BECAUSE THERE'S

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.011
SO THERE'S SEE AND AND IN THEIR

00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:55.514
MINDS A WIDE RANGE OF CHOICES.

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:56.815
BUT IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A

00:16:56.882 --> 00:16:59.017
NEED TO AND THE THE NATIONAL

00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:01.854
REGULATOR STEPS IN OFF JIM WHICH

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.055
IS -- WHICH

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:04.356
IS GOT A COMPLICATED NAME

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:06.225
ANYMORE REPEAT --

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:07.760
AN ACE DAY THEY BECOME THE

00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:10.829
SUPPLIER FLAT PASSED RESORT.

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:12.798
SO -- AGAIN

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:14.933
CUSTOMERS DID NOT EXERCISE THEIR

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.035
RIGHT TO CHOOSE BASED ON PRICE

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:19.204
OR ANY OTHER PATTERN THAT WE

00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:21.373
COULD SEE IT'S JUST THAT PEOPLE

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:21.974
TENDED TO STAY WITH WHAT THEY

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.575
HAVE.

00:17:23.642 --> 00:17:24.109
OUR CHALLENGES ARE REALLY

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:25.144
DIFFERENT --

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.945
WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON GREEN

00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:28.480
POWER NOT JUST RE NOBLES BUT

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:30.682
ALSO GHG REDUCTION RELIABILITY

00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:32.317
AND COST.

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:33.652
WHEREAS MOST OF THE STATE'S F

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:36.822
ONLY FOCUS TO ON TO THOSE AXES.

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:38.624
BUT WE DID SEE SOME COMMON

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.492
THEMES.

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:41.894
CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT AND PRICE

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.764
TRANSPARENCY ARE REALLY CRITICAL --

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:47.366
REGIONALIZED GRID.

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:49.435
BEING ABLE TO PROCURE OUTSIDE OF

00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:51.670
THE NARROWLY POLITICALLY

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:54.173
JURISDICTION ONLY DEFINED MARKET

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:56.408
CAN BE VERY IMPORTANT.

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:58.377
CENTRALIZED STATE PROCUREMENT

00:17:58.444 --> 00:18:00.412
BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:03.382
REACHING GOALS AND TO ACTUALLY

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:05.484
ENSURING RELIABILITY THAT THE

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:07.186
INDIVIDUAL CHOICES SOMETIMES

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:08.687
DON'T GO TOGETHER WELL TO MAKE

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:13.559
UP THE WHOLE.

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:15.494
A SUCCESSFUL OUR ENERGY MARKETS

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:18.096
HAVE A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT

00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:19.832
IN CASE THERE'S A FAILURE.

00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:22.868
SO CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE THIS

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.369
THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:26.138
HAVE HAVE PLAYED THEIR ROLE BY

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:27.206
DEFAULT.

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:28.474
INCLUDING BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.708
OBLIGATION TO SERVE UNDER THE

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.176
LAW.

00:18:31.243 --> 00:18:32.744
AND SERVE A CUSTOMER SHOWS UP

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:34.346
THEY HAVE TO SERVE THEM.

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:35.981
BUT WE SAW DURING THE LAST

00:18:36.048 --> 00:18:37.516
ENERGY CRISIS WHEN THERE IS A

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:40.285
FAILURE OF A ELECTRICITY SERVICE

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:42.588
SERVICE PROVIDER TWO HUNDRED

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:43.155
FIFTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS GOT

00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:46.125
DUMPED ON TO ONE UTILITY.

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:47.826
THE CUT THE THE PUBLIC TRICITY

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:49.862
SERVICE PROVIDER FAILED BECAUSE

00:18:49.928 --> 00:18:50.863
THEY WERE BUYING THEIR

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:52.931
ELECTRICITY AND THE WHOLESALE

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:54.366
MARKET THERE WAS.

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:55.801
HARD TO WEEKS HOT WEATHER

00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:57.503
EVERYBODY IN THE WEST WAS USING

00:18:57.569 --> 00:18:59.104
ALL THE GENERATION THEY GET

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:01.039
ACCESS TO THIS COMPANY WAS LATE

00:19:01.106 --> 00:19:02.241
TO THE GAME.

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:04.243
WAS PAYING VERY HIGH PRICES RAN

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:05.711
OUT OF CASH.

00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:06.178
COULDN'T PAY FOR MORE

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:07.779
ELECTRICITY.

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:09.281
THEIR CUSTOMERS THAN GOT DUMPED

00:19:09.348 --> 00:19:11.183
ONTO THE PREVIOUS --

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.352
UTILITY AND THEY STARTED TO

00:19:13.418 --> 00:19:15.387
HEMORRHAGE CASH.

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:17.956
AND SO THAT'S NOT A GOOD PATTERN

00:19:18.023 --> 00:19:19.825
YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME PLAN YOU

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:21.326
WENT AHEAD CHEN INSURANCE PLAN

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:23.195
THAT'S THE PROVIDER OF LAST

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:24.563
RESORT.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.698
SO WHAT WERE ALSO SEEN AS WE THE

00:19:26.765 --> 00:19:28.534
STRONG POSSIBILITY WE COULD FALL

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.102
BEHIND IN OUR IN REACHING OUR

00:19:30.168 --> 00:19:31.904
GREEN GOALS THE SO THE STATE'S

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.505
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:36.074
REQUIRES THAT ALL I WHO USE.

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:37.142
A COMPETITIVE COMMUNITY

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:39.177
AGGREGATORS AND ELECTRICITY

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:41.446
SERVICE PROVIDERS MEET CERTAIN

00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:42.114
TARGETS.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.782
SB THREE FIFTY REQUIRES THAT ALL

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:45.417
LOAD SERVING ENTITIES WHICH

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:47.986
INCLUDES ALL THOSE HAVE ONLY

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:49.555
SIXTY FIVE OF THEIR PERCENT OF

00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:51.189
THEIR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO

00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:52.724
STANDARD ELIGIBLE KERMIT FROM

00:19:52.791 --> 00:19:53.926
CONTRACTS.

00:19:53.992 --> 00:19:57.195
THAT ARE TEN YEARS OR LONGER BY.

00:19:57.262 --> 00:19:58.297
TWENTY TWENTY ONE SHARP REPORT

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:01.266
TO THE LEGISLATURE IN OCTOBER

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:01.833
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ON THE

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.569
RENEWABLE FOR FOR THE STANDARD

00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:03.769
SAID.

00:20:03.835 --> 00:20:04.403
DE IDENTIFIED SOME CLEAR

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:07.806
CHALLENGES ADDITIVE COMMUNITY

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.508
AGGREGATORS THE CCAC AND

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.310
ELECTRICITY SERVICE PROVIDERS

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:13.378
AND IN MEETING THEIR OUR PS

00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:14.980
REQUIREMENTS.

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:18.083
SO CAL CCA INDICATES THAT THAT

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.052
TWO GIGAWATTS OF RENEWABLE

00:20:20.118 --> 00:20:21.653
PROJECTS ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.389
OR ARE THE BILL TO SERVE FONG.

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:27.926
THEIR CUSTOMERS OF THE CCA'S BY.

00:20:27.993 --> 00:20:28.694
TWENTY TWENTY THAT'S TWO

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.996
GIGAWATTS THAT'S ABOUT THE FIFTY

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:34.733
SIX PROJECTS ROMA TOTALING --

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.501
TWENTY ONE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS.

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:37.736
NOT ALL OF PROJECT YOUR BILL IN

00:20:37.803 --> 00:20:39.371
MY EXPERIENCE OF HAVING BUILT A

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:40.772
LOT OF LARGE RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:42.808
PROJECTS IS THAT NOT ALL

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:47.446
PROJECTS THE CARD GET CONTRACTS

00:20:47.512 --> 00:20:48.480
YOU THINK YOU CAN DO TO IMPROVE

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:51.083
THE OVERALL SUCCESS PATTERN FOR

00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:53.352
PROJECTS BUT THERE'S NO

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:56.888
GUARANTEES IN IN THE MARKET.

00:20:56.955 --> 00:20:58.457
EVEN IF THE THOSE PROJECTS ARE

00:20:58.523 --> 00:21:00.258
ALL BUILT THE CCASTILL HAVE A

00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:01.793
SHORTFALL FOR MEETING THEIR REAP

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.662
ARE THERE AND THEY'RE IN A GREAT

00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:06.331
RESOURCE PORTFOLIO GOALS.

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:07.332
FOR ENERGY.

00:21:07.399 --> 00:21:09.801
PROBABLY THEY'LL HAVE TO TRIPLE

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:11.236
THEIR CURRENT PROCUREMENT PLANS

00:21:11.303 --> 00:21:13.972
BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND IT SIX

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:16.341
TIMES AS MUCH BY.

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:16.942
TWENTY THIRTY THE MEETING IN

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:18.877
SIZE OF THE EXISTING PROJECTS

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:20.412
THAT THE LIST.

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:22.581
IS ABOUT ONE POINT SIDE GET FIVE

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:24.616
GIGAWATTS TO MEET THAT TWENTY

00:21:24.683 --> 00:21:27.152
THIRTY GOAL THAT'S ROUGHLY FIVE

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:29.287
THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PROJECTS

00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:29.588
[inaudible]

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:30.656
SO.

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:32.457
THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A LITTLE

00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:34.292
PROBLEMATIC I'M NOT JUST I'M

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:35.994
USING THAT BECAUSE WE HAD BETTER

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:37.896
INFORMATION BUT THE ELECTRICITY

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.865
SERVE FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS ALSO

00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:41.433
PROBABLY ARE GOING TO HAVE

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.235
SIMILAR KINDS OF PROBLEMS. ONE

00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:44.403
OF THE DIFFERENCES THOUGH FOR

00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:46.271
THE FOR THE COMPETITIVE

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:47.639
COMMUNITY AGGREGATORS IS THAT

00:21:47.706 --> 00:21:49.274
HAVE A HARD TIME.

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:50.475
GETTING FINANCING BECAUSE ALL

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:51.576
THEY HAVE THIS CUSTOMERS THEY

00:21:51.643 --> 00:21:53.311
DON'T HAVE ASSETS THEY DON'T

00:21:53.378 --> 00:21:55.347
HAVE PROPERTY THAT THE PEOPLE

00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:58.684
CAN LEAN ON IN CASE THERE'S A

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.052
FAILURE TO PAY.

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:01.720
SO FOR A SIMPLE SOLUTION WOULD

00:22:01.787 --> 00:22:03.088
BE FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:04.690
THAT CREATE THE CCA'S TO PUT

00:22:04.756 --> 00:22:06.258
THEIR BALANCE SHEETS ON THE LINE

00:22:06.324 --> 00:22:08.126
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY CREATES

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:09.594
UNCERTAINTY AND FINANCING.

00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:11.563
HOWEVER MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.998
ARE ARE A LITTLE LEERY OF

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:14.433
GETTING INTO THE VOLATILE AND

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:17.769
SOMETIMES HARSH ELECTRIC MARKETS.

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:18.970
SO WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME

00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:21.206
SHIPS WITH THE RELIABILITY IN

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:23.241
THE FOR MORE WILL BE CALL

00:22:23.308 --> 00:22:25.911
RESOURCE ADEQUACY OF WAIVERS

00:22:25.977 --> 00:22:29.281
AFTER THE THE FAILURE

00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:31.950
220-002-0001 THE LEGISLATURE --

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.985
REQUIRED ALL LOAD SERVING

00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:36.288
ENTITIES TO PROCURE ALL THE

00:22:36.354 --> 00:22:38.790
ELECTRICITY THEY WOULD NEED FOR

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:40.058
STE FORESEEABLE PEAK

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:41.593
CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.028
AND TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:45.997
THAT TO US THE THE LARGER

00:22:46.064 --> 00:22:47.799
PICTURE IS THE IT UNTIL LAST

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:50.635
YEAR WE MAYBE HAD TWO REQUESTS

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:53.171
FOR WAIVERS FROM COMPLIANCE.

00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:57.342
OVER THE ENTIRE PROGRAM.

00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:59.111
THE YEAR BEFORE LAST WE HAVE

00:22:59.177 --> 00:23:01.146
ELEVEN FROM ELECTRICITY SERVICE

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:03.782
PROVIDERS AND AND CCA'S SOME OF

00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:05.450
THE CCA'S ARE SERVED BY THIS

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:07.152
ELECTRICITY SERVICE PROVIDERS

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:08.653
FOR SHORT TERM CONTRACTS AND

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.921
WITH THOSE WAIVERS FOR

00:23:09.988 --> 00:23:11.289
COMPLIANCE HAVE ANY ANYTHING TO

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:12.090
DO WITH.

00:23:12.157 --> 00:23:13.792
PRESERVING RACHEL WAS A MAJOR

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:15.660
ISSUE THE MAJOR ISSUE IS THAT

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:17.763
MANY OF THESE SMALLER ENTITIES

00:23:17.829 --> 00:23:20.198
ARE FOCUSED IN PARTICULAR AREAS

00:23:20.265 --> 00:23:22.367
WHERE THE GRID TOPOLOGY DOESN'T

00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:24.336
ALLOW ALL THE ELECTRICITY THAT

00:23:24.402 --> 00:23:25.670
THEY NEED TO FLOW IN FROM

00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:28.073
OUTSIDE ON THOSE PEAK DAYS

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.808
SO YOU HAVE TO HAVESOME

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:31.409
GENERATION WITHIN THOSE LOAD

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:32.444
POCKETS.

00:23:32.511 --> 00:23:34.246
GIVEN THAT WITHIN THOSE LOAD

00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:35.747
PARKS YOU MAY HAVE TO SEE CA

00:23:35.814 --> 00:23:37.249
SOME MEDIA X. ELECTRICITY

00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:38.984
SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS AND

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.218
SOME I OWE YOU CUSTOMERS.

00:23:40.285 --> 00:23:41.720
THERE'S COMPETITION TO GET

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:42.921
ACCESS TO THAT BACK UP

00:23:42.988 --> 00:23:44.856
GENERATION WHICH IS DWINDLING

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:46.057
BECAUSE THEY ARE ONLY GETTING

00:23:46.124 --> 00:23:49.561
CONTRACTS OR MAYBE TWO HUNDRED

00:23:49.628 --> 00:23:50.061
HOURS A YEAR.

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:51.196
AND IT GETS HARD FOR PEOPLE TO

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:53.665
BE ABLE TO TO FIT WITHIN THE

00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:55.867
HARSH AND SOMETIMES VOLATILE

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:57.369
SITUATIONS.

00:23:57.435 --> 00:23:58.370
OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET

00:23:58.436 --> 00:23:59.971
PARTICULARLY IN THOSE

00:24:00.038 --> 00:24:01.406
CONSTRAINTS SPACES.

00:24:01.473 --> 00:24:03.575
BUT IT REPRESENTS IN MY MIND AT

00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:06.778
LEAST A RISK TO THE THE THE

00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:07.913
LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK THAT THE

00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:10.115
LEGISLATURE SET TO GUARANTEE

00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:11.516
RELIABILITY.

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:13.351
AND WE NEED TO SECURE THAT WE'VE

00:24:13.418 --> 00:24:15.921
LOOKED IN OUR RESOURCE ADEQUACY

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:18.690
PROCEEDING TO MAYBE CREATE WHAT

00:24:18.757 --> 00:24:20.492
WE WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS IS SAID

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:22.394
NO MORE ONE YEAR CONTRACT BRING

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.929
US THREE YEAR CONTRACT.

00:24:23.995 --> 00:24:26.064
SO THAT MAY ACTUALLY ENTICE SOME

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:27.933
PROVIDERS INTO SIGNING WITH SOME

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:29.100
OF THE SMALLER ENTITIES.

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:31.203
BECAUSE THERE'S A BETTER FUTURE

00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:32.604
FOR THEIR FOR THEIR THEIR

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:33.972
GENERATION.

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:35.907
WITHIN THOSE LOADS CONSTRAINED

00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:36.374
AREAS.

00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:38.343
BUT WE ALSO WORRY THAT MAYBE

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.879
WHAT WE NEED IS SOME KIND OF

00:24:40.946 --> 00:24:43.114
CENTRAL PROCUREMENT AT THE STATE

00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:45.317
LEVEL THAT CAN CURE ALL OF THESE

00:24:45.383 --> 00:24:47.185
PROBLEMS AND NOT LEAVE SOME

00:24:47.252 --> 00:24:50.288
CUSTOMER AT RISK OF RELIABILITY

00:24:50.355 --> 00:24:52.057
THAT THAT'S THAT'S OUR FEAR.

00:24:52.123 --> 00:24:53.458
SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT

00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:54.860
WHAT THAT WITHIN THE RESOURCE

00:24:54.926 --> 00:24:57.762
ADEQUACY PROCEEDING [inaudible]

00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:59.364
SO.

00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:01.666
AGAIN YOU KNOW WE ARE CAUGHT

00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:03.768
BETWEEN.

00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:05.604
THESE MORE.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.440
CLEAR MODELS WHERE ALL CUSTOMERS

00:25:08.506 --> 00:25:10.108
HAVE RETAIL PROVIDERS FOR

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:11.476
ELECTRICITY THEN THERE'S

00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:13.879
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION.

00:25:13.945 --> 00:25:15.413
ON THE SIDE SOMETIMES THOSE

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.382
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:19.251
OPERATORS CAN COMPETE.

00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:21.620
WITHIN THESE OTHER MARKETS TO

00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:23.855
PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY OR TO PROVIDE

00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:27.058
ELECTRICITY ON A CHOICE BASIS

00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:29.895
CUSTOMERS CAN PICK AND CHOOSE.

00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:32.797
WE'RE NOT AT THE FAR END THAT WE

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:34.366
STARTED OUT HOWEVER EITHER WHICH

00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:36.034
IS A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED

00:25:36.101 --> 00:25:37.936
UTILITY WHERE THE UTILITIES ON

00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:39.504
THE ELECTRICITY THEY OWN THE

00:25:39.571 --> 00:25:42.374
WIRES THEY OWN EVERYTHING ELSE.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.576
AND DO YOU ALL DON'T HAVE ANY

00:25:44.643 --> 00:25:45.443
CHOICE AT ALL.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.412
WE'RE IN BETWEEN.

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:49.814
AND THAT THAT PROBABLY REQUIRES

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:52.250
SOME PROTECTIONS AND SO.

00:25:52.317 --> 00:25:54.819
WE TRIED TO IDENTIFY WHAT WE

00:25:54.886 --> 00:25:56.588
THOUGHT WERE GAPS IN OUR SECOND

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:58.356
REPORT FROM OUR CHOICE PROJECT

00:25:58.423 --> 00:26:00.458
IT'S HERE BEFORE BE FOR YOU

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:02.994
TODAY WE RELEASED IT AND OCTOBER.

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:05.664
ALREADY WE'RE SEEING SOME.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.099
BILLS THAT MATCH SOME OF THE THE

00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:10.535
SOLUTIONS THAT WE SEE THAT WE

00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:11.770
IDENTIFIED HERE.

00:26:11.836 --> 00:26:15.407
SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE THE THE

00:26:15.473 --> 00:26:17.042
YOU DO UTILITY DIVERSITY

00:26:17.108 --> 00:26:18.410
CONTRACTING IS MORE MORE

00:26:18.476 --> 00:26:20.078
CUSTOMERS DEPART FROM THE

00:26:20.145 --> 00:26:21.913
ELECTRICITY COMPANY UTILITIES

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.349
FROM FOR THEIR THEIR OUR

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:25.617
ELECTRICITY.%

00:26:25.684 --> 00:26:28.453
THE MONEY THAT SPENT ELSEWHERE

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.555
DOESN'T GO INTO THAT DIVERSITY

00:26:30.622 --> 00:26:32.590
CONTRACTING PROCESS WHICH IS NOW

00:26:32.657 --> 00:26:34.059
A TEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

00:26:34.125 --> 00:26:35.794
THAT'S A HUGE INVESTMENT IN TO

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.729
FRAGILE COMMUNITIES AROUND THE

00:26:37.796 --> 00:26:39.297
STATE NOT JUST FOR JOBS.

00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:41.032
BUT ALSO TO BUILD THE BUSINESS

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:42.667
INFRASTRUCTURE HELPS TO MAKE

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:44.636
THOSE THRIVING COMMUNITIES

00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:45.904
AMERICA MANY LEVELS.

00:26:45.971 --> 00:26:48.673
SENATOR BRADFORD IS ACTUALLY --

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:49.274
PUT FORWARD SOME LANGUAGE ON

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:50.642
THAT.

00:26:50.709 --> 00:26:54.079
ONE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE --

00:26:54.145 --> 00:26:55.880
STE RESORT BILL FROM SENATOR

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:58.249
HERTZBERG THE AND I'M.

00:26:58.316 --> 00:26:59.351
I WILL LEAVE IT TO HIM TO

00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:01.086
CONTINUE TO CLARIFY HIS THINKING

00:27:01.152 --> 00:27:02.187
ON THAT HIS STAFF HAS BEEN

00:27:02.253 --> 00:27:03.521
MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO

00:27:03.588 --> 00:27:05.490
ACTUALLY CREATE THAT INSURANCE

00:27:05.557 --> 00:27:06.191
HEDGE.

00:27:06.257 --> 00:27:08.460
AGAINST FAILURES OF ANY THESE

00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:10.729
DIVERSE COMPANIES.

00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:14.232
HE ALSO HAS PROPOSED EARLIER

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:16.701
EXPANDING THE DIRECT ACCESS FOR

00:27:16.768 --> 00:27:18.003
ALL COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL

00:27:18.069 --> 00:27:19.537
CUSTOMERS HIS INITIAL BILL

00:27:19.604 --> 00:27:21.439
ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE LIFTED THE

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:22.741
CAP LAST YEAR.

00:27:22.807 --> 00:27:24.609
WE WORKED WITH THEM AND HE WE

00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:26.778
HAVE A MORE FACED PROCESS THAT

00:27:26.845 --> 00:27:28.546
WERE WORKING UNDER TO ACTUALLY

00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:30.448
EXPAND IT TO A LARGER NUMBER

00:27:30.515 --> 00:27:32.117
THIS YEAR.

00:27:32.183 --> 00:27:34.953
BUT HE WANTS A PLAN TO EXPAND

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.323
DIRECT ACCESS COMPLETELY BY

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:39.491
TWENTY TWENTY SO WE WILL PROVIDE

00:27:39.557 --> 00:27:41.960
THAT TO HIM --

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:43.294
I THINK THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES

00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:44.729
THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT OR

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:46.164
CONTENT TO CONFIRM THAT ARE

00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:47.966
CONTAINED HERE I DO WE'RE STILL

00:27:48.033 --> 00:27:49.901
TRYING TO REMAIN SOMEWHAT

00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:51.036
AGNOSTIC.

00:27:51.102 --> 00:27:53.438
PUT TO ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS

00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:56.841
HEART OVER PAYING ON BEHALF OF

00:27:56.908 --> 00:27:58.143
CUSTOMERS WHO DEPARTED.

00:27:58.209 --> 00:28:00.345
SO YOU DON'T HAVE THAT ON FARE

00:28:00.412 --> 00:28:01.112
SUBSIDY.

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:03.048
THAT WE TRY TO KEEP ELECTRICITY

00:28:03.114 --> 00:28:05.784
RATES AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYBODY

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.919
THAT WE KEEP IT RELIABLE AND

00:28:07.986 --> 00:28:09.354
THAT THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:10.555
CONTINUE TO MEET OUR CLEAN

00:28:10.622 --> 00:28:13.224
ENERGY GOALS AT THE SAME TIME.

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:14.592
THAT WE FOLLOW OUT THE

00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:16.694
LEGISLATURE'S DIRECTION FOR MANY

00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:18.296
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES MANY

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:19.664
DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODELS.

00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:21.366
BUT I WILL I WILL JUST SAY THAT

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:23.535
GENERALLY THE PLACES THAT WE

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:25.336
HAVE LOOKED AT THAT HAVE BEEN

00:28:25.403 --> 00:28:28.373
MOST SUCCESSFUL HAVE A CLEAR

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.842
MODEL AND THEY TEND TO DOCTOR

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:32.477
LEAN TOWARDS.

00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:35.480
A COMPLETE FREEDOM OF CHOICE AS

00:28:35.547 --> 00:28:37.515
OPPOSED TO THE KINDS OF MIX THAT

00:28:37.582 --> 00:28:40.785
WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:42.253
SO I THANK YOU I'D BE HAPPY TO

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.357
TAKE QUESTIONS EDU HAVING THAT.

00:28:46.424 --> 00:28:48.059
SORRY THAT'S A LOT TO COVER.

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:49.160
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.029
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AGAIN --

00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:51.830
THIS WEEK --

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:54.232
FREE SHEET IF IF I'M AGAIN I'M

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:55.733
HAVE TO BUY NEW BUSINESSES

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.237
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME.

00:28:59.304 --> 00:29:00.705
WE'VE I WILL THAT'S FOR SURE.

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:01.272
YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEE

00:29:01.339 --> 00:29:01.873
BACKGROUND PAPER AND YOU

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.007
MENTIONED IT TALKED A LITTLE BIT

00:29:03.074 --> 00:29:05.343
ABOUT CCA'S AND IT HIGHLIGHTED

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.711
AND AS WE ALL KNOW THERE'S

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:09.280
THERE'S NO RATE APPROVAL PROCESS

00:29:09.347 --> 00:29:10.982
WITHIN OVER APPROVAL AUTHORITY

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:13.051
WITHIN THE CPC --

00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:16.020
WELL THERE IS FOR I USE --

00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:18.823
DO YOU YOU KNOW GIVEN THE SHE

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.626
SHOULD COME UNDER THE OF

00:29:21.693 --> 00:29:23.094
REGULATORY AUTHORITY THE CPUC.

00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:25.430
WELL SO THERE'S A WIDESPREAD

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:28.299
BELIEF AMONG CCA ARM OPERATORS

00:29:28.366 --> 00:29:30.835
THAT THEY HOME WILL ALWAYS BE

00:29:30.902 --> 00:29:34.239
CHEAPER BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

00:29:34.305 --> 00:29:35.974
TO PAY PROPERTY TAX AND THEY

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.143
DON'T HAVE TO PAY SHAREHOLDERS.

00:29:38.209 --> 00:29:40.145
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE SIMPLY

00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:41.813
BECAUSE WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.149
TO IS PRIMARILY PROVIDING.

00:29:44.215 --> 00:29:45.950
ELECTRICITY SERVICE THOSE OTHER

00:29:46.017 --> 00:29:48.887
COSTS STILL GO TO RATE PAYERS BY

00:29:48.953 --> 00:29:50.355
THE BILL IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR

00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:51.589
ELECTRIC BILL.

00:29:51.656 --> 00:29:53.458
USUALLY IT'S STILL UNDER THE

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:54.792
NAME OF YOUR UTILITY BECAUSE

00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:56.728
THEY PROVIDE BILLING SERVICE TO

00:29:56.794 --> 00:29:57.929
ALL THE CCA'S.

00:29:57.996 --> 00:30:00.064
THERE'S AN ELECTRICITY CHARGE IN

00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:02.100
SOMETIMES IT WILL NAME THE CCA

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:03.868
IF THEY CARE TO BE NAMED AND

00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:05.603
THEN THE REST OF THE BILL IS

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:08.306
TRANSMISSION DISTRIBUTION NON BY

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:11.910
PASSABLE CHARGES AND THE PUBLIC

00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:12.644
GOODS CHARGES.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:15.880
SO IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT

00:30:15.947 --> 00:30:17.248
THERE'S ENOUGH LEFT.

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:19.484
ON THOSE THIN MARGINS OF

00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:22.120
RESELLING ELECTRICITY.

00:30:22.187 --> 00:30:25.156
FROM THIRD PARTY CONTRACT THAT

00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:26.724
THERE'S WHO CAN REALLY BE THAT

00:30:26.791 --> 00:30:28.259
KIND OF COMPETITION THAT PEOPLE

00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:29.694
TALK ABOUT.

00:30:29.761 --> 00:30:32.297
MY FEARS I ACTUALLY HAVE MORE TO

00:30:32.363 --> 00:30:34.933
DO WITH HOW DO YOU MAKE.

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:36.634
WHAT'S LEFT OF THOSE OLD

00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:38.403
UTILITIES WHO STILL HAVE TO RUN

00:30:38.469 --> 00:30:39.938
THE POLES AND WIRES STILL HAVE

00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:41.739
TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES UNDER

00:30:41.806 --> 00:30:43.208
THE PUBLIC GOODS CHARGE STILL

00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:44.976
HAVE TO FIND THE SMALL GENERATOR

00:30:45.043 --> 00:30:46.644
INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR BATTERY

00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:47.745
STORAGE.

00:30:47.812 --> 00:30:50.448
STILL HAVE TO TO FUND ON ENERGY

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:53.518
METERING HOW WILL THEY ACTUALLY

00:30:53.585 --> 00:30:55.720
BE STABLE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:57.222
THOSE KEY SERVICES THAT THE

00:30:57.288 --> 00:30:59.524
LEGISLATURE HAS HAS TASKED THEM

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:00.291
WITH.

00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:01.993
AND THE ANSWER THERE AND THERE'S

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.962
A VERY GOOD PAPER FROM FROM

00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:05.630
MACKENZIE IS TO MOVE TOWARDS A

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:07.498
MORE FLAT CHARGE BECAUSE MOST OF

00:31:07.565 --> 00:31:08.666
WHAT TEY'RE DOING IS NOT

00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:09.934
VOLUMETRIC.

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:13.972
PEOPLE DON'T USE MORE OR LESS OF

00:31:14.038 --> 00:31:15.573
THEY MAY ACTUALLY USE MORE

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.975
ELECTRICITY DURING PEAK

00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:18.276
CONGESTION HOURS.

00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:19.377
SO THE THERE BUT THEY'RE

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:20.678
DIFFERENT RATE STRUCTURES THAT

00:31:20.745 --> 00:31:21.980
CAN MEET THAT.

00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:24.082
THE OTHER THING THAT I FEAR FOR

00:31:24.148 --> 00:31:25.416
SOME OF THE THE LAST --

00:31:25.483 --> 00:31:27.719
WELL GROUNDED CCA LEADERSHIP IS

00:31:27.785 --> 00:31:29.554
THAT THEY WON'T.

00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:30.955
USE THE STATE'S.

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:33.558
EMERGING TIME OF USE PROGRAM

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:35.193
WHICH SINCE PRICE SIGNALS FOR

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.495
PEOPLE TO AVOID USING DURING

00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:39.430
THOSE PEAK HOURS AND SO THE BEST

00:31:39.497 --> 00:31:40.465
EXAMPLE WE HAVE HERE IN

00:31:40.531 --> 00:31:42.367
CALIFORNIA SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:43.735
UTILITY DISTRICT.

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:46.371
WHERE THEY GOT 8% REDUCTION ON A

00:31:46.437 --> 00:31:49.207
MINIMUM OF THEIR ELECTRICITY USE

00:31:49.274 --> 00:31:52.477
THROUGH A PEAK CHARGE DURING THE

00:31:52.543 --> 00:31:54.412
TWO HUNDRED HOURS OF THE YEAR?

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:55.813
WHEN ACTUALLY TRICITY IS IN

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.416
SHORT SUPPLY SAU KHI THEY TELL

00:31:58.483 --> 00:32:00.018
PEOPLE CHARGING MORE?

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:01.319
SO THAT WE CAN BUILD THOSE POWER

00:32:01.386 --> 00:32:03.955
PLANTS JUST TO PROVIDE YOU POWER

00:32:04.022 --> 00:32:05.290
DURING THOSE TWO HUNDRED HOURS

00:32:05.356 --> 00:32:07.592
OR YOU CAN GET SMART USE

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:09.394
TECHNOLOGY WILL HELP YOU WITH

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.863
ENERGY TOOLS. TO AVOID USING

00:32:11.929 --> 00:32:13.264
ELECTRICITY HOURS THAT'S WHERE I

00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:15.199
THINK THAT WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE

00:32:15.266 --> 00:32:16.301
THE MOST PROBLEMS.

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:18.870
BUT WHAT I DO THINK IS IMPORTANT

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:20.238
ON EVERY LEVEL WHETHER IT'S

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:22.507
ELECTRICITY SERVICE PROVIDERS

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:25.209
WHETHER IT'S IT'S CCA'S

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:26.377
WEATHER'S INCOME.

00:32:26.444 --> 00:32:28.112
IS WE NEED BETTER TOOLS THAT

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:30.248
SHOW PEOPLE THE RATES THEY CAN

00:32:30.315 --> 00:32:31.316
CHOOSE FROM.

00:32:31.382 --> 00:32:35.720
BECAUSE AS IT IS THEY JUST HAVE

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:39.223
TO FORMATION VIED PEOPLE AS THEY

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.159
DO IN TEXAS AND NEW YORK SO

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:43.194
PEOPLE CAN SEE AND COMPARE.

00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:44.629
IN IN THIS FOLLOW UP ON ON THE

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:46.798
REGULATORY ASPECT OF IT DO YOU

00:32:46.864 --> 00:32:48.066
THINK YOU COULD DO.

00:32:48.132 --> 00:32:49.200
I DON'T HAVE BETTER NECESSARY

00:32:49.267 --> 00:32:51.836
JOB IF YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:52.770
THAT AUTHORITY.

00:32:52.837 --> 00:32:54.038
TO THOROUGHLY FOR DISCLOSURE I

00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:55.440
THINK THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

00:32:55.506 --> 00:32:56.841
NECESSARY SOMEBODY HAS TO DO

00:32:56.908 --> 00:32:58.476
THAT IT COULD BE YES IT COULD BE

00:32:58.543 --> 00:33:00.745
THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION.

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:02.313
BUT EVERYBODY HAS TO PUT THEIR

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.548
CARDS ON THE TABLE.

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:05.116
AND I'M IN DIFFERENT AS TO WHO

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:06.284
THAT REALLY DOES THAT PROVIDES

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:07.952
IT BUT IT'S GOT TO BE THERE.

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:10.722
I DO WORRY MORE ON THIS ISSUE OF

00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:12.523
MEETING OUR OUR OUR CLEAN ENERGY

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.158
GOALS AND HOW WE ACTUALLY DO

00:33:14.225 --> 00:33:15.126
THAT.

00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:18.262
WE KNOW THAT EVEN IF EVERYBODY

00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:20.098
NEEDS THEIR ASPIRATIONAL ON

00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:22.033
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.134
GOALS.

00:33:23.201 --> 00:33:26.704
THAT THAT ADDS UP TO LESS THAN

00:33:26.771 --> 00:33:28.840
ON THE CLEAN AND RELIABLE GRID

00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:30.341
THERE WE WANT SIMPLY BECAUSE

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:32.076
INDIVIDUAL CHOICES DON'T ALWAYS

00:33:32.143 --> 00:33:33.444
MATCH UP.

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:34.746
AND TOO MANY PEOPLE MAKING

00:33:34.812 --> 00:33:35.913
DIFFERENT CHOICES SOMETIMES WILL

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.615
FORCE.

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:39.717
MORE NEED --

00:33:39.784 --> 00:33:41.619
FOR FOR A NATURAL GAS SPEAKERS

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:42.920
TO BACK IT UP HOW DO YOU

00:33:42.987 --> 00:33:45.056
ACTUALLY HARMONIZE THAT AND YET

00:33:45.123 --> 00:33:46.257
THE OPTIMAL.

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:47.525
OUT OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT

00:33:47.592 --> 00:33:50.027
CHOICES AND THAT MAKE REQUIRE A

00:33:50.094 --> 00:33:51.462
CENTRAL PROCUREMENT --

00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:55.133
MECHANISM SIMILAR TO NEW YORK TO

00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:55.566
INITIALLY --

00:33:55.633 --> 00:33:57.268
MUCH THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN I WANT

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:58.069
TO ALSO THANK OF PRESIDENT

00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:00.104
PICKER FOR YOUR PRESENTATION BUT

00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:01.906
AS I LISTEN TO A TODAY AND HAS

00:34:01.973 --> 00:34:05.243
LAST WEEK AND FOR THE LAST

00:34:05.309 --> 00:34:08.079
COUPLE YEARS AS WE TALKED ABOUT

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:09.514
I'M ALWAYS LIFE WHAT CONCERNS.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.115
AND I THINK YOUR OVERALL

00:34:11.182 --> 00:34:12.784
PRESENTATION IS ONE OF CONCERN

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:14.886
AS WELL AS TO THE FUTURE WHERE

00:34:14.952 --> 00:34:17.588
WE ARE IN CALIFORNIA AS IT

00:34:17.655 --> 00:34:18.322
RELATES TO ENERGY [inaudible]

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.324
WOULD YOU.

00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:21.392
DETERMINAR --

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:24.429
CLASSIFY OR DESCRIBE OUR OURPS

00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:26.497
PROGRAM IS BEING SUCCESSFUL.

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.232
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THIS THAT

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:29.667
FOR WHAT I BELIEVE THE REAL

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:31.169
PURPOSE WAS WHICH WAS TO

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:34.205
STIMULATE INVESTMENT IN NEW

00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:36.374
TECHNOLOGIES AND DEVELOPERS

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:37.475
THERE WEREN'T PRESENT IN

00:34:37.542 --> 00:34:39.444
CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY MARKET PLACE

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:40.878
YES.

00:34:40.945 --> 00:34:43.414
WE NOW HAVE FROM THE ELECTRIC

00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:45.416
UTILITIES PROVIDING PROBABLY

00:34:45.483 --> 00:34:48.052
CLOSE TO FORTY THIRD BETWEEN

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:49.320
THIRTY FIVE AND 40% OF ALL THEIR

00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:52.390
ELECTRICITY FROM REAL PROJECTS

00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:54.025
THAT ARE IN THE GROUND.

00:34:54.091 --> 00:34:56.194
WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE CONTRACTS

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.162
FOR PROJECTS BUILT BY DEVELOPERS

00:34:58.229 --> 00:34:59.630
WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED BUILDING IN

00:34:59.697 --> 00:35:01.199
CALIFORNIA HAVE MOST OF THEIR

00:35:01.265 --> 00:35:02.667
ENTITLEMENTS IN PLACE AND ARE

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:04.535
JUST WAITING FOR DEMAND TO REACH

00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:06.304
THE POINT THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.506
START TO COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION

00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:09.874
AND CONNECT TO THE GRID.

00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:11.542
THOSE UTILITIES WILL PROBABLY BE

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:16.080
SOMEPLACE UPWARDS OF 4250% --

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:19.016
SOMETIME TALK AROUND TWENTY

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:20.251
TWENTY TWO AND CAN EASILY GET

00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:22.753
260% BY TWENTY THIRTY SO THAT IT

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.589
BRING NOBLES HAVE BECOME EASY.

00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:27.558
THE CHALLENGES RELIABILITY AND

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:30.228
D. CARBONIZATION AND SO THOSE I

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:31.629
THINK ARE ARE --

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:33.831
AND COST WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:35.433
THERE WAS A HEAVY PRICE PAID TO

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.601
GET THERE.

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:37.969
THE EARLY CONTRACTS WERE VERY

00:35:38.035 --> 00:35:39.270
EXPENSIVE.

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:40.938
IN PART BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING

00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:42.807
WITH FOLKS WHO HAD NOT REALLY

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:45.009
HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE BUILDING

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:46.143
THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS IN

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.545
CALIFORNIA.

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:49.547
THEY YOU HAD BANKS THERE WERE

00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:52.383
CLEARLY NERVOUS ABOUT LENDING

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.485
INTO CALIFORNIA ONE HAND TO

00:35:54.552 --> 00:35:56.087
THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

00:35:56.153 --> 00:35:58.990
IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF THE

00:35:59.056 --> 00:35:59.290
PRESIDENT --

00:35:59.357 --> 00:36:00.691
PRESIDENT.

00:36:00.758 --> 00:36:01.526
OBAMA'S.

00:36:01.592 --> 00:36:04.562
STIMULUS DOLLARS STARTED TO

00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:06.664
RELENT BUT THAT WAS AIDED BY THE

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:07.865
FACT THAT THEY STARTED TO SEE

00:36:07.932 --> 00:36:09.300
SUCCESS.

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:12.136
THAT IN I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT A

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:14.338
LOT OF OF INNOVATION AND

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:16.307
BRINGING LABOR COSTS DOWN ON THE

00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:19.377
PART OF OF THOSE DEVELOPERS

00:36:19.443 --> 00:36:22.647
PRIMARILY BY NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO

00:36:22.713 --> 00:36:24.115
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT

00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:25.917
IT TOOK TO CONSTRUCT A WIND OR

00:36:25.983 --> 00:36:27.184
SOLAR PROJECT.

00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:30.021
HAS ALSO BROUGHT THE PRICE DOWN

00:36:30.087 --> 00:36:31.222
THESE DAYS [inaudible]

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:33.090
SO FROM.

00:36:33.157 --> 00:36:35.459
THE THE AT THE AT THAT POINT I

00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:37.161
THINK WITH SUCCESS BUT IT WAS IT

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:40.431
WASN'T REALLY AIMED AT PRICE OR

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:42.133
RELIABILITY THAT WAS HERS BEING

00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:43.634
DEALT WITH SEPARATELY.

00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:45.369
IT WAS FOCUSED ON JUST BRINGING

00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:47.038
THESE NEW TECHNOLOGY INTO COMMON

00:36:47.104 --> 00:36:50.074
USE AND AN UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:51.776
AND I'M.

00:36:51.842 --> 00:36:53.110
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GRAPPLE WITH

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:54.912
OKAY YOU'VE SEEN UTILITIES MAKE

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:56.514
A MAJOR.

00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:58.616
YOU DON'T TRANSITION TOWARDS

00:36:58.683 --> 00:36:59.750
RENEWABLE ENERGY ENTERING THE

00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:01.118
LEAGUE'S LONG TERM LONG TERM

00:37:01.185 --> 00:37:02.553
CONTRACT AND NOW.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:03.854
IN THE SAME TIME THE CUSTOMERS

00:37:03.921 --> 00:37:05.389
ARE BEING ALLOWED TO MIGRATE

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:07.391
AWAY WHAT SENSE DOES THAT MAKE

00:37:07.458 --> 00:37:08.926
THAT WE HAVE ASKED HIM TO MAKE

00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:09.794
THIS INVESTMENT.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.729
AND NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE UP 260%

00:37:11.796 --> 00:37:13.664
IN SOME ASPECTS FOR THEY HAVE NO

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:14.765
CUSTOMERS A SERVER.

00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:17.501
AND THERE'S NO GREATER AMOUNT OF

00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:20.037
RE NOBLES AVAILABLE TO SEE C. H.

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:21.539
R. E. S. BEES AND THEY ARE TO

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:22.607
THE UTILITIES THEY'RE ALL

00:37:22.673 --> 00:37:23.641
STICKING THEIR STRONG TO THE

00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:24.575
SAME POLL.

00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:26.377
A RENEWABLE ENERGY SO ARE WE

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:28.679
ACHIEVING OUR GOAL OF MORE

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:30.915
CLEANER ENERGY WHEN IT'S ONLY SO

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:33.217
SO MUCH AVAILABLE IN UTILITIES

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:35.019
ARE PICKED ARE PACKED WITH YOUR

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:35.786
ARE PROCURING AND CONTINUE TO

00:37:35.853 --> 00:37:36.454
PROCURE.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.524
POWER I NEVER SEEK TO QUESTION

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:44.362
THE IT WILL HAPPEN AND AND

00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:45.796
THAT'S MY CONCERN AND I AND I

00:37:45.863 --> 00:37:47.465
AND I SPEAK FROM A INDIVIDUAL

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:47.999
WHO.

00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:49.934
WORK FOR UTILITY FOR NUMBER

00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:51.302
YEARS AND I'M NOT HERE CARRYING

00:37:51.369 --> 00:37:52.136
A WATER BECAUSE I KNOW WITH THE

00:37:52.203 --> 00:37:53.838
DO WELL AND WHAT THEY DO LOUSY.

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:56.374
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M ALL FOR

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.242
CUSTOMER CHOICE BUT THE SCENARIO

00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:59.877
YOU GAVE IS NOT CUSTOMER CHOICES

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:01.512
CUSTOMER FORCE.

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:03.948
I MEAN AND YOU SAID ILLINOIS'

00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:04.715
MANY OTHER CUSTOMERS ARE GOING

00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:07.118
BACK TO THE INCUMBENT UTILITY

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:08.619
WHAT WHAT'S THE REASON FOR IT'S

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:10.121
NOT SO MUCH THE CUSTOMERS IT'S

00:38:10.187 --> 00:38:13.457
ACTUALLY AN ASSOCIATION OF THE

00:38:13.524 --> 00:38:14.158
THOSE --

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:16.260
MUNICIPAL ENERGY AGGREGATORS GOT

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:18.029
TOGETHER BECAUSE THEIR HOPE WAS

00:38:18.095 --> 00:38:18.963
THEY WERE GOING TO BEAT THE

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:22.833
PRICE OF OF THE THE UTILITIES

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.834
AND THEY COULDN'T I THINK THEY

00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:25.236
DECIDE WOMAN THIS IS NOT WHATWE

00:38:25.302 --> 00:38:26.837
SHOULD BE DOING ON BEHALF OF OUR

00:38:26.904 --> 00:38:28.039
COMMUNITIES.

00:38:28.105 --> 00:38:31.075
OKAY SO MY LASTING SINCE THEY

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:32.643
HAVE NO BALANCE SHEET --

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:33.711
THEY HAVE NO ASSETS.

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:36.080
I MEAN AGAIN.

00:38:36.147 --> 00:38:37.782
I'VE SEEN THE SCENARIO THIRTY

00:38:37.848 --> 00:38:39.350
YEARS AGO MANY CITIES AND AND

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:41.252
CALIFORNIA FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS

00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:43.054
PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY ALL THOUGHT

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:43.988
THEY CAN GET INTO THE MORTGAGE

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:46.390
BUSINESS AND HELP PEOPLE BUY

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:46.891
HOMES.

00:38:46.957 --> 00:38:48.292
TODAY YOU'RE PROBABLY BE HARD

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:50.027
PRESSED TO FIND ANY CITY WERE

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:51.295
FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS PROGRAM

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:53.664
HOUSE THIS ANY DIFFERENT BECAUSE

00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:54.999
AGAIN.

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:56.033
MOST CITIES HAVE ENOUGH DOT A

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.101
HARD ENOUGH TIME RUNNING THEIR

00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:59.670
PARKS AND REC DEPARTMENT LET

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:01.038
ALONE ELECTRICAL GRID ITSELF.

00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:03.007
AND YOU SAID THAT THEY WILL BE

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:05.476
THE DEFAULT OF FALTER.

00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:06.410
WHAT WOULD I SHOULD SAY TO POP

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:08.512
BACK TO THE CITY IF YOUR CCA

00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:09.847
FAILS WHAT CITY ONCE ON THE

00:39:09.914 --> 00:39:11.515
BALLOT YOU?

00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:14.051
WHEN THEY CAN'T EVEN ARE YOU

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:14.719
DON'T PAY THEIR PENSION

00:39:14.785 --> 00:39:16.120
OBLIGATION?

00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:17.455
FOR SO ELECTRICITY MARKETS A

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:19.690
SAID CAN BE VERY VOLATILE VERY

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:21.959
HARSH AND I THINK THAT --

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:24.061
THAT COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR CITY --

00:39:24.128 --> 00:39:26.363
MANAGERS ARE VERY WARY OF

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.599
PUTTING HEIR CREDIT --

00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:31.769
ON THE LINE IN THESE RYAN KINDS

00:39:31.836 --> 00:39:33.971
OF OF ENERGY MARKETS.

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:37.074
SO THAT LEAVES THE THE THE THE

00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:39.577
LARGEST CREDIT ASSET. FOR THESE

00:39:39.643 --> 00:39:41.078
CLEAN COMMUNITY AGGREGATORS OF

00:39:41.145 --> 00:39:42.813
THEIR CUSTOMERS THE ELECTRICITY

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.348
SEPARATE FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS.

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:45.750
HAVE A DIFFERENT ADVANTAGE

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:47.518
THEY'RE USUALLY OUT OF STATE

00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:49.053
UTILITIES.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.522
WHO ARE DABBLING INCH RETAIL

00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:53.124
CHOICE HEARING CALIFORNIA?

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:54.492
THEY HAVE BALLOT SHEETS THEY

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:55.793
HAVE THE HOME FOR THE HOME

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.128
UTILITY AND ITS ASSETS TO THE

00:39:57.194 --> 00:40:03.134
BACK OF I HEARD I HEARD A

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.568
QUESTION IN THERE THAT WASN'T.

00:40:04.635 --> 00:40:06.137
CLEAR TO ME IN YOUR ANSWER AND

00:40:06.203 --> 00:40:08.606
AND MY MY QUESTION ONLY REQUIRES

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:10.541
A VERY SIMPLE YES OR NO.

00:40:10.608 --> 00:40:12.243
BUT IT'S A KIND OF PIGGY BACKING

00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:14.078
ON SOME OF THE DISCUSSION HERE

00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:16.747
BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT.

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:19.150
I HAVEN'T ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT.

00:40:19.216 --> 00:40:20.885
AND I'M JUST GOING TO BE HARD TO

00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:23.254
GET.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.722
TO BUT YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT WE

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:26.690
NEED SOME.

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:28.159
SOMEONE IN THE STATE TO IN A

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:29.326
PROCUREMENT BALANCING AT SOME

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:31.362
LEVEL.

00:40:31.428 --> 00:40:34.298
AND THAT IS OCCASION BYE BYE.

00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:36.133
THE WSDOM OF THE LEGISLATURE IN

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.134
TERMS OF HOW WE HAVE.

00:40:37.201 --> 00:40:38.502
CHOSEN -- TO

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:40.104
YOU KNOW ALLOW FOR THE EMERGENCE

00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:42.606
OF OF CCA'S IN THIS IN THIS CASE.

00:40:42.673 --> 00:40:44.375
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CCA

00:40:44.441 --> 00:40:46.210
SHOULD BE UNDER YOUR REGULATORY

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:47.545
CONTROL.

00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:49.380
I'M I I THINK THE DATE TO SOME

00:40:49.446 --> 00:40:51.382
EXTENT THEY ARE BECAUSE WE SAT

00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:54.385
THE STATE'S GOALS FOR ENERGY AND

00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:55.986
WE'RE WORKING OUT HOW THAT WORKS

00:40:56.053 --> 00:40:56.921
UNDER THE NEW INTEGRATED

00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:58.722
RESOURCE PLAN WHICH BALANCES

00:40:58.789 --> 00:40:59.356
BOTH.

00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:01.458
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD BUT

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:03.294
ALSO THE CARBON READ ACT --

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.164
THE J. SHE REDUCTION GOALS OF SB.

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:08.933
THREE FIFTY SO WE SET THE GOALS

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:11.035
THE QUESTION IS IS DOES IT IS

00:41:11.101 --> 00:41:12.937
THE CPUC THE RIGHT AGENCY TO

00:41:13.003 --> 00:41:14.772
ACTUALLY DO PROCUREMENT AS A

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:16.707
BACKSTOP IN OTHER STATES IT'S A

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:18.542
SEPARATE AGENCY FROM THE

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:20.477
REGULATOR SO ALL I'LL SAY THAT I

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:23.214
THINK THAT THERE'S A ROLE FOR

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.015
THAT BACKSTOPS PROTECTION.

00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:26.317
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT HAS TO

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:27.952
THAT'S IT JOBS HI SO.

00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:30.588
HI SO PROBABLY WOULD HAVE SOME

00:41:30.654 --> 00:41:32.623
DIFFICULTY DOING THAT AT THE

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.391
RETAIL LEVEL --

00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:36.493
DAY SET TRANSMISSION STANDARD SO

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.995
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A CONFLICT

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:39.663
FOR THEM ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.298
THEY ACTUALLY --

00:41:41.365 --> 00:41:44.735
GET STUCK DOING THAT FOR AND

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:46.904
NERSC RULES OR THROUGH THERE ARE

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:49.473
THE RUN MUST RUN --

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.243
CONTRACTS BUT AGAIN YOU COULD

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:54.378
CHOOSE ANY OF THOSE I'M SURE YOU

00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:56.881
GET A SATISFACTORY ANSWER OTHER

00:41:56.947 --> 00:41:58.549
STATES HAVE CHOSEN A SEPARATE

00:41:58.616 --> 00:41:59.683
ENTITY.

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:02.620
THAT FOCUSES ON THAT.

00:42:02.686 --> 00:42:05.522
PUTS SOME PUTS THE THE THE THE

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:07.157
PROGRAMS TOGETHER AND THEN

00:42:07.224 --> 00:42:09.093
EVERYBODY HAS TO GO THERE FOR

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:10.661
EITHER THEIR ALL THEIR ENERGY OR

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:11.962
FOR SOME RESIDUAL THAT THEY

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:15.099
CAN'T PROCURE.

00:42:15.165 --> 00:42:16.700
CENTER WIENER A LESSON FROM

00:42:16.767 --> 00:42:17.935
CENTER.

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:18.602
IF I CAN BUILD ON THAT JUST EVER

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:19.203
SO SLIGHTLY TALKING ABOUT THE

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.771
RELIABILITY --

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:22.606
THE CHI SO ON THE RELIABILITY

00:42:22.673 --> 00:42:23.908
ISSUE THERE'S ALREADY SOME

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:25.776
MECHANISMS IN PLACE IF ENOUGH

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:27.244
RESOURCES ARE BOUGHT IN A LOCAL

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:29.013
AREA FOR THE KAISER TO STEP IN

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:30.281
AND BUY SOME RESOURCES.

00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:31.982
ON IT'S NOT THE MOST EFFICIENT

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:32.616
MECHANISM THAT'S WHY THERE'S A

00:42:32.683 --> 00:42:34.051
LOT TO CONVERSATIONS ON

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:35.052
DIFFERENT MECHANISM.

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:36.787
A BROADER ISSUE WHERE THE ICE SO

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:38.489
WE REALLY CAN'T STEP IN AND HELP

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:40.224
THOUGH AND WE ARE SEEING THIS AN

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:41.492
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING.

00:42:41.558 --> 00:42:45.329
IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:45.763
LOOKING LONG TERM.

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:46.897
AND THE RESOURCES THAT PEOPLE

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:49.266
ARE LOOKING TO BUY LONG TERM

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:51.669
DON'T ADD UP TO OUR CLINICAL.

00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:52.903
THE I. SO WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.805
POTENTIALLY TO STEP IN AND SAY

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:57.341
THESE RESOURCES DON'T RULE OUT --

00:42:57.408 --> 00:42:59.610
ADD UP TO OUR RELIABILITY GOALS.

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:01.312
IT'S NOT AT ALL CLEAR THAT UNDER

00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:02.613
BECAUSE IS FOR JURISDICTIONAL

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.381
THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY YOU

00:43:04.448 --> 00:43:06.050
HAVE ENOUGH SOLAR YOU HAVE

00:43:06.116 --> 00:43:08.118
ENOUGH GEO THERMAL YOU HAVE

00:43:08.185 --> 00:43:09.687
ENOUGH --

00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:11.655
PUMP HYDRO THOSE RESOURCES THAT

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:12.756
ARE OUT THERE.

00:43:12.823 --> 00:43:14.725
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE SOMETHING

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:16.260
THAT WOULD BE WELL FIT TO THE HI

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:18.429
SO AND WE'RE ALREADY SEEN THAT

00:43:18.495 --> 00:43:19.964
RIGHT NOW IN THE ISRAELI

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.131
RESOURCE PLANNING.

00:43:21.198 --> 00:43:22.633
THAT WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.935
ENTITIES SAY THIS IS WHAT OUR

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:26.704
LONG TERM PLANS ARE THEY ARE

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.439
ADDING UP TO THE STATEWIDE GOALS

00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:29.373
AND THAT'S WHAT AT THE POINT

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.476
WHERE WE WE ARE QUITE SURE WHAT

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:35.446
TO DO ABOUT THAT YET.

00:43:35.512 --> 00:43:36.480
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN A FEW

00:43:36.547 --> 00:43:38.449
PEOPLE ASKED WHETHER THE CPC

00:43:38.515 --> 00:43:39.650
CEBU CITY SHOULD HAVE A GREATER

00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:40.985
ROLE.

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:43.954
IN REGULATING --

00:43:44.021 --> 00:43:44.254
CCA'S AYE --

00:43:44.321 --> 00:43:48.025
I WOULD AND FRANKLY WITH ALL

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:48.592
RESPECT IS TO FIGURE YOUR

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:50.894
COMMENTS HERE TODAY --

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.396
ARE --

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.198
FURTHER BOLSTER MY BELIEF --

00:43:54.264 --> 00:43:55.966
I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE CPC

00:43:56.033 --> 00:43:57.234
HAVING A GREATER ROLE I THINK

00:43:57.301 --> 00:43:58.535
THE CPUC WOULD --

00:43:58.602 --> 00:44:00.137
PRETTY QUICKLY MOVED TO KILL OFF

00:44:00.204 --> 00:44:04.708
CCA'S INTO SPRING SUPER BLUNT --

00:44:04.775 --> 00:44:07.244
AND HI.

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:08.846
I AM I HAVE A SENSE OF YOUR OF

00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:10.681
FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE AGENCY --

00:44:10.748 --> 00:44:12.082
BECAUSE I I BELIEVE THAT THE

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:14.952
AGENCY IS ATTEMPTING TO THE

00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:17.087
DOUBLE DOWN ON THIS PAPER

00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:19.723
CENTRALIZE MONOPOLY MODEL THAT

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:21.658
HAS NOT WORKED WELL. FOR

00:44:21.725 --> 00:44:24.261
CALIFORNIA.

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.763
THE HOSTILITY TOWARD CCA'S THE

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.297
HOSTILITY TOWARDS --

00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:29.333
D. -- WHICH

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.135
WE'RE SEEING AGAIN AND AND AND

00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:34.972
SAYS THE REALLY PROBLEMATIC --

00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:37.074
PROPOSED RULES TO IMPLEMENT --

00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:39.043
DR LEGISLATION THAT WE PASSED

00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:40.477
LAST YEAR THAT WOULD HAVE MADE

00:44:40.544 --> 00:44:42.012
THAT LEGISLATION COMPLETELY

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:45.215
INEFFECTIVE AND TOTALLY OVERTURN

00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:47.551
THE WILL OF THE LEGISLATURE --

00:44:47.618 --> 00:44:49.219
AND SPECIFICALLY --

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:52.256
YOU MU MENTIONED TODAY OF THE

00:44:52.322 --> 00:44:54.591
TERMS OF CCA'S POTENTIALLY NOT --

00:44:54.658 --> 00:44:56.360
MEETING THERE --

00:44:56.427 --> 00:44:59.129
RESOURCE ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS

00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:00.431
NOT SEE THIS VIDEO BUT I'VE BEEN

00:45:00.497 --> 00:45:01.765
INFORMED THAT AN ASSEMBLY

00:45:01.832 --> 00:45:02.766
HEARING.

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:03.867
EARLIER THIS YEAR HE MADE A

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:05.803
STATEMENT THERE WERE ELEVEN

00:45:05.869 --> 00:45:07.738
RESOURCE ADEQUACY RAPE WAIVERS

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:09.673
GRANTED AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.341
THAT A MAJORITY WERE GRANTED TO

00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:13.710
CCA'S -- THE

00:45:13.777 --> 00:45:16.847
CCA'S WENT INTO A PUBLIC RECORDS

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:18.515
REQUEST OF THE CPUC.

00:45:18.582 --> 00:45:19.850
AND IT APPEARS THAT OF THE

00:45:19.917 --> 00:45:21.218
ELEVEN WEEK.

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:23.687
OR A. WAIVERS GRANTED LAST YEAR.

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:24.721
ZERO WERE FOR CCA'S SO COULD YOU

00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:27.991
JUST CLARIFY FOR ME HOW MANY.

00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:30.427
OF THE ELEVEN ARE A WAIVER IS

00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:32.996
GRANTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WORK

00:45:33.063 --> 00:45:34.064
FOR CCA'S.

00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:36.200
SO USUALLY I SAY CCA OR

00:45:36.266 --> 00:45:38.502
ELECTRICITY SERVICE PROVIDER SUN

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:40.404
I DIDN'T SAY THAT AND THAT'S

00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:41.972
WHAT I'M MY APOLOGIES IS HOW HOW

00:45:42.039 --> 00:45:42.573
OTHERS.

00:45:42.639 --> 00:45:44.007
OF ELEVEN RESOURCE ADEQUACY

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:48.812
WAIVERS GRANTED IN TWENTY

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:52.149
EIGHTEEN HOW MANY WERE FOR CCA'S.

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:54.351
I'M I BELIEVE OUT OF THE NUMBER

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:56.019
ELEVEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:45:56.086 --> 00:45:58.589
EITHER ONE OR ZERO WERE FOR CCA

00:45:58.655 --> 00:46:00.991
THE REST WERE FOR E. S. PEAS --

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:03.260
BUT LET'S HAVE.

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:04.761
THE TALKING ABOUT THE ARE A

00:46:04.828 --> 00:46:06.363
WAIVERS ON FLOATING AROUND

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:07.965
CONFUSES THE ISSUES I THINK BOTH

00:46:08.031 --> 00:46:09.733
WAYS TO BE QUITE HONEST.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.735
I AM SO IS PRESENT PICKER WAS

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:13.804
ALLUDING TO A LITTLE WHILE AGO

00:46:13.871 --> 00:46:15.772
ON I THINK IT WAS CENTER HERE

00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:16.340
HUESO ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT

00:46:16.406 --> 00:46:17.908
THAT.

00:46:17.975 --> 00:46:18.976
YOU ARE A WAIVERS WE'RE TALKING

00:46:19.042 --> 00:46:21.345
ABOUT HERE FOR LOCAL RESOURCE --

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:22.613
AND THERE'S A MECHANISM IN THERE

00:46:22.679 --> 00:46:24.648
IF A LOAD SERVING ENTITY

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:27.784
INCLUDING THE S. P. S. CCA OR

00:46:27.851 --> 00:46:29.286
AND I OWE YOU CAN'T.

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:31.588
GET THE RESOURCES THEY NEED

00:46:31.655 --> 00:46:33.323
LOCALLY --

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:34.158
THEY CAN ASK FOR WAY FOR THE

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:35.926
WAIVER PROCESS EXISTS TO

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:37.261
MITIGATE AGAINST MARKET POWER SO

00:46:37.327 --> 00:46:38.629
IF THEY'RE GOING OUT AND TRYING

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:39.663
TO BUY.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:41.265
A RESOURCE IN THE GENERATORS

00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:42.900
WITHHOLDING --

00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:45.702
THE INTO T. IS NOT.

00:46:45.769 --> 00:46:47.771
WE'VE GRANTED THE LAST YEAR I

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:50.707
THINK TEN OF THE ELEVEN WAIVERS --

00:46:50.774 --> 00:46:53.210
IN ONE WE THOUGHT DIDN'T OPERATE

00:46:53.277 --> 00:46:54.645
PROPERLY THERE --

00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:56.947
WE'RE SEEING A SIMILAR TREND --

00:46:57.014 --> 00:46:57.881
THIS YEAR --

00:46:57.948 --> 00:47:00.250
THIS HAS TO DO THE GROWTH IN THE

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:02.719
WAIVERS WE DON'T THINK HAS TO DO

00:47:02.786 --> 00:47:04.755
BECAUSE THE C. C. A. R. E. S. P.

00:47:04.821 --> 00:47:05.722
YEAR THE I. ARE YOU IS A BAD

00:47:05.789 --> 00:47:06.623
ACTOR.

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:08.692
WE THINK IT'S COMING BECAUSE OF

00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:10.928
A CONFLUENCE OF TWO SIX ONE

00:47:10.994 --> 00:47:12.062
THERE'S ACTUALLY LESS LOCAL

00:47:12.129 --> 00:47:13.597
RESOURCES AVAILABLE NOW THAN

00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:15.732
THERE WERE. FIVE YEARS AGO

00:47:15.799 --> 00:47:17.100
BECAUSE THE ONCE THROUGH COOLEY

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:19.603
POWER PLANTS ARE CLOSING DOWN

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.004
AND THAT IS THEN MAKING FOR A

00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:23.574
TIGHTER MARKET ON LOCAL

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.410
RELIABILITY --

00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:27.277
I'VE IT'S ARGUABLE WHETHER

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:28.212
THAT'S A GOOD THING OR NOT WE'RE

00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:29.112
GETTING TO THAT JUST ENOUGH

00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:31.415
RESOURCES AND NOT OVER PROCURING

00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:32.316
IF YOU'RE MEMBER COUPLE YEARS

00:47:32.382 --> 00:47:33.750
AGO THE LA TIMES IS PRETTY

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:35.152
CRITICAL OF WE HAD TOO MUCH

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:36.520
RESOURCE.

00:47:36.587 --> 00:47:37.888
NOW WERE THERE ON AND THEN THE

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:39.456
OTHER ISSUE IS IF YOU HAVE MRE

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:41.558
AND MORE ENTITIES TRYING TO FIVE

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:43.594
FROM THE SAME SET OF PLANTS.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.163
THOSE PLANS HAVE AN ABILITY NOW

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.664
TO POTENTIALLY.

00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:49.166
PLAY THE MARKET A LITTLE BIT SO

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:51.868
WE THINK THAT COMBINATION OF

00:47:51.935 --> 00:47:54.805
HAVING A LOT OF ENTITIES TRYING

00:47:54.871 --> 00:47:57.741
TO PROCURE THE THIS IS DOING THE

00:47:57.808 --> 00:47:58.175
PROBLEM.

00:47:58.242 --> 00:47:59.643
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANY ONE OF

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.245
THOSE PEOPLE ASKING FOR THE

00:48:01.311 --> 00:48:02.613
WAIVER IS A BAD ACTOR.

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:04.147
IT'S THE FACT THAT WE'RE GETTING

00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:06.283
A LOT OF WAIVERS IS THE SIGN

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:07.551
THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM IN THE

00:48:07.618 --> 00:48:08.018
MARKET.

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:08.452
RIGHT.

00:48:08.518 --> 00:48:09.853
I UNDERSTAND BUT THE THE

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.289
COMMENTS WERE HEARING ARE THIS

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:13.590
CONSISTENT DRUM BEAT --

00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:15.225
THERE'S A RESOURCE ADEQUACY

00:48:15.292 --> 00:48:16.526
PROBLEM WITH THIS YOU SEE AIDS

00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:18.395
IS A RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROBLEM

00:48:18.462 --> 00:48:20.030
WITH THE CCA'S.

00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:24.901
AND I I JUST THINK.

00:48:24.968 --> 00:48:25.168
YOU KNOW.

00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:26.937
I THINK THE FACTS DON'T SUPPORT

00:48:27.004 --> 00:48:27.437
THAT -- AND

00:48:27.504 --> 00:48:28.605
AND THIS IS WHY I WOULD NOT

00:48:28.672 --> 00:48:31.808
SUPPORT EXPANDING CP'S THIRTY

EIGHTEEN THE CPUC.

00:58:43.052 --> 00:58:44.087
POSTED A CENTRAL BY STRUCTURE IT

00:58:44.153 --> 00:58:45.622
IS APPROPRIATE TO IMPLEMENT

00:58:45.688 --> 00:58:46.890
WHAT'S CALLED A MULTI YEAR

00:58:46.956 --> 00:58:50.593

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:51.461
P. JEANNIE BELIEVES THAT --

00:58:51.527 --> 00:58:52.528

00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:12.382
IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE A CENTRAL

DOWN THIS PATH.

00:59:57.126 --> 00:59:58.494
NUMBER ONE IS THAT WE HAVE A

00:59:58.561 --> 01:00:00.396
VERY SUBSTANTIAL GENERATION

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:01.764

BECAUSE OF THE SEGREGATION.

01:00:58.521 --> 01:01:00.156
I BELIEVE YES I DO AND

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:01.591
HISTORICALLY DO UTILITIES HAVE

OUR LOAD.

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:06.362

PRINCIPLES AND NEXT STEPS THAT

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:28.678
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THIS YEAR.

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:30.713
CUSTOMER CHOICE AND EVOLUTION OF

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:31.914

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:39.789
OF DEFINED STATE POLICY

01:02:39.856 --> 01:02:43.326
OBJECTIVES CONSUMER PROTECTIONS.

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:44.460
AND STABLE MARKETS.

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:46.095
REGULATION CERTAINLY HAS ITS

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:47.964
FLAWS AND THE CALIFORNIA P. YOU

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.732
SEE IS A HIGHLY IMPERFECT ENTITY

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:51.734
AS WE ALL NOW.

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:52.969
BUT EXPERIENCE SINCE THE

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:56.606
DEREGULATION DEBACLE IN TWO

01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:57.240
THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE PROVES

01:02:57.306 --> 01:02:58.274
THE STATE CAN ACCOMPLISH

01:02:58.341 --> 01:03:00.109
SUBSTANTIAL RESULTS THROUGH

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:01.410
SMART REGULATION.

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:03.579
DIRECT OVERSIGHT OF THE

01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:05.148
PURCHASING BY LOW SERVING

01:03:05.214 --> 01:03:07.049
ENTITIES AND THE EXERCISE A

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.618
BROAD ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY.

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:09.952
SO THE STATE SHOULD BE CAREFUL

01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:11.621
TO REPLACE BROAD OVERSIGHT AND

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:12.588
ENFORCEMENT.

01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:14.557
WITH PROMISES THAT LOCAL CONTROL

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.092
OR COMPETITION OR CUSTOMER

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:18.094
PREFERENCES PROVIDE A COMPLETE

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:20.763
SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT FUNCTION.

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:23.900
ON THE ENERGY CRISIS OF TWO

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:24.500
THOUSAND ONE TWO THOUSAND WAS

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:25.701
DRIVEN IN PART BY A LACK OF

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:26.936
COORDINATED PLANNING.

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:27.904
AND A NEAR COMPLETE RELIANCE ON

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:31.474
MARCH HOUSE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS WE

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:32.942
CAN'T MAKE THAT SAME MISTAKE

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:33.743
AGAIN.

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:36.045
ON TODAY WE FACE A CLASSIC

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:37.647
COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEM WHERE

01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:39.415
EVERY INDIVIDUAL BUYER IN THE

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:40.116
MARKET.

01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:42.251
WANTS TO PROCURE RESOURCES BASED

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:43.920
ON THEIR OWN PREFERENCES.

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:45.888
EVEN IF THE LARGER SYSTEM NEEDS

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:47.557
ARE LEFT UNADDRESSED.

01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:48.791
THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:50.493
STATE REGULATORS NEED TO BE

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.694
PREPARED TO MAKE SOME HARD

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:52.895
CHOICES IN THE DAYS AHEAD.

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:54.430
NOT ASSUME THAT ALL COMPETITIVE

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:57.567
ACTORS ARE GOING TO BE SATISFIED

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:58.201
BY THE POLICY CHANGES THAT ARE

01:03:58.267 --> 01:03:58.834
NEEDED.

01:03:58.901 --> 01:03:59.468
BUT LIKE TOPPER COUPLE

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:01.204
PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE ACTION FIRST

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:02.605
OF ALL WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.440
CUSTOMERS ARE INDIFFERENT TO THE

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.943
CHOICES MADE BY OTHER CUSTOMERS.

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:08.010
IN OTHER WORDS --

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:09.779
THE DECISIONS MADE BY ONE SUBSET

01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:11.380
OF CUSTOMERS CAN'T FRUSTRATE THE

01:04:11.447 --> 01:04:13.049
COLLECTIVE ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:14.217
SHARED POLICY GOALS.

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:15.284
OUR CUSTOMER CHOICE ISN'T

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.887
VALUABLE IF IT MAKES IT HARDER

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:19.355
TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED OUTCOMES.

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:20.556
AND SECONDLY WE NEED TO MAKE

01:04:20.623 --> 01:04:21.791
SURE THAT CUT THE CHOICES MADE

01:04:21.857 --> 01:04:22.792
BY ONE SET OF CUSTOMERS DON'T

01:04:22.858 --> 01:04:24.660
SHIFT RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEGACY

01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:26.162
COST TO OTHER CUSTOMERS.

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:27.597
WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT A LOT

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:29.131
OF THESE BATTLES OVER COST

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:31.834
ALLOCATION OVER TERRACE FOR

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:33.336
DISTRIBUTED RESOURCES OVER EXIT

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:34.237
FEES.

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:35.538
THESE ARE EFFECTIVELY CUSTOMER

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:38.241
VERSUS CUSTOMER CHOICES IT'S

01:04:38.307 --> 01:04:41.544
WHICH SET OF CUSTOMERS PAY --

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:42.144
AND IN MANY CASES AS MUCH AS I

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:44.380
WOULD TO PAY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:48.451
THAT'S ARGUING ABOUT IN FRONT OF

01:04:48.517 --> 01:04:49.485
THE COMMISSION WERE ARGUING

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:51.487
ABOUT WHICH SET OF CUSTOMERS

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:52.088
PACE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WERE

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:52.455
FAIR [inaudible]

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:53.990
I CAN.

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:54.857
WE NEED TO ESTABLISH

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:56.659
COMPREHENSIVE RESOURCE PLANNING

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.261
REQUIREMENTS AND VIABLE

01:04:58.327 --> 01:04:59.562
MECHANISMS TO ACHIEVE ARE

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:00.696
DEFINED OBJECTIVES WHAT'S THE

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:02.131
PROBLEM.

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:03.766
THE PROBLEM IS THE COMPETITIVE

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:04.967
ELECTRICITY MARKETS ARE

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:06.535
TYPICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY SHORT

01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:08.337
TERM COMMITMENTS AND SHORT TERM

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:10.039
CUSTOMERS.

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:10.973
DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS HAVE

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.009
RELIED VERY HEAVILY ON SHORT

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:14.543
TERM PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES TO

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:15.978
SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS.

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:17.079
AND NEW COMMUNITY CHOICE

01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:19.482
AGGREGATORS ALSO RELY PRIMARILY

01:05:19.548 --> 01:05:20.683
ON SHORT TERM PROCUREMENT

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:21.817
STRATEGIES.

01:05:21.884 --> 01:05:23.653
MORE MATURE CCA'S HAVE BEEN ABLE

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:25.221
TO MIGRATED TO MORE LONG TERM

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:26.489
COMMITMENTS AND THAT'S A

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:27.657
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT.

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:29.492
BUT THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:30.726
IN THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:31.661
THEY'VE BEEN THE GOLD STANDARD

01:05:31.727 --> 01:05:33.296
HISTORICALLY FOR DRIVING YOU

01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:34.997
RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT --

01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:36.832
AND THAT'S BECAUSE NEW RESOURCE

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:38.234
DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES LONG TERM

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:39.902
COMMITMENTS AND STABLE CREDIT

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:41.804
WORTHY COUNTERPARTIES.

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:43.306
BUT GOING FORWARD WHEN WE LOOK

01:05:43.372 --> 01:05:45.074
AT THE MARKET ALMOST ALL OF THE

01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:46.876
NEW RESOURCES NEEDED TO MEET OUR

01:05:46.942 --> 01:05:47.877
STATES GOALS.

01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:49.145
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE DRIVEN

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:50.279
BY THE COMPETITIVE PORTION OF

01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:51.447
THE MARKET SERVE BY COMMUNITY

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:53.449
CHOICE AGGREGATORS AND DIRECT

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:54.350
ACCESS PROVIDERS.

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:55.918
SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:57.253
MODIFY OUR POLICIES OR COME UP

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.755
WITH NEW MECHANISMS TO ENSURE

01:05:59.822 --> 01:06:00.556
THAT WE GET THERE.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:02.558
ON THE OUR PS PROGRAM IS THE

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:03.993
MOST SUCCESSFUL ELEMENT OF THE

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.394
STATE'S CIMATE POLICY --

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.096
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH IT'S NOT

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:08.531
DESIGNED TO BE A SILVER BULLET

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:09.765
WE ALSO HAVE AN INTEGRATED

01:06:09.832 --> 01:06:11.701
RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS.

01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:13.302
THAT PROCESS IS --

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:14.737
IN AN INTERESTING AN INTERESTING

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:17.773
CROSS XIN ISSUED YESTERDAY BY

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.875
THE PC POINTS TO SERIOUS

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:21.143
DEFICIENCIES IN THE COMMISSION'S

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.445
OWN PROCESS.

01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:23.479
AND THE FACT THAT THE PLANS

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:24.947
COMING IN SO FAR SIMPLY AREN'T

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:26.215
ADDING UP --

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:27.583
AND RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.018
THAT POLICY IS GOING TO HAVE TO

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:30.286
OF ALL.

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:31.721
ME AND UNDER THE OUR PS PROGRAM

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:33.522
AS WAS MENTIONED A FEW MINUTES

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:35.858
AGO THERE'S A REQUIREMENT 465%

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:37.293
OF ALL PROCUREMENT.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.761
USED FOR COMPLIANCE TO COME FROM

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:41.230
LONG TERM CONTRACTS IN TWENTY

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:43.099
TWENTY ONE WELL IT'S TWENTY

01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:43.733
NINETEEN WE'VE GOT TO GET THERE

01:06:43.799 --> 01:06:45.234
QUICKLY AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:46.402
EVERYBODY'S GONNA MAKE IT.

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:47.503
SO WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:48.671
ADDRESS THIS COLLECTIVE ACTION

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:49.872
PROBLEM OF THE ISSUES WERE

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:51.140
FACING IN THE MARKET.

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:52.375
AND THIS IS WHEREWE SEE THE

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:55.811
NEED FOR A CENTRALISED BACKSTOP

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:57.780
MECHANISM FOR PROCUREMENT --

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:00.116
I THINK THE WORD BACKSTOPS

01:07:00.182 --> 01:07:00.950
IMPORTANT HERE.

01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:02.385
BECAUSE IT INDICATES THAT THERE

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:04.320
IS A DESIRE TO LET LOW SERVING

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:06.055
ENTITIES DO THEIR SHARE --

01:07:06.122 --> 01:07:08.023
ASSEMBLE THEIR PORTFOLIOS AND

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:10.092
HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO MEET

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:11.761
THE STATE'S NEEDS BUT WHEN NEEDS

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:13.129
ARE ON MATT.

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:13.896
THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ENTITY TO

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:16.132
STEP IN WELL TODAY WE HAVE TO

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:17.266
BACKSTOP MECHANISMS THAT ARE IN

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:19.101
USE ONE THE INVESTOR OWNED

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:20.403
UTILITIES.

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:21.036
UTILITIES HAVE BEEN THE LEVER

01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:22.838
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:24.106
COMMISSION HAS PULLED REPEATEDLY

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.508
TO SAY GO DO THIS THING MAKE IT

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:26.809
HAPPEN WE NEED MORE RESOURCE

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.144
ADEQUACY --

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.278
WE NEED MORE OF THIS AND MORE OF

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:30.780
THAT THAT NUMBER IS IS

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:32.081
INCREASINGLY BROKEN.

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:33.949
ON THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

01:07:34.016 --> 01:07:36.552
THEMSELVES ARE FORMING THAT

01:07:36.619 --> 01:07:37.787
FUNCTION WE HAVE AN INVESTOR

01:07:37.853 --> 01:07:39.855
OWNED UTILITY IN BANKRUPTCY

01:07:39.922 --> 01:07:41.090
OTHERS FACING CREDIT CHALLENGES.

01:07:41.157 --> 01:07:42.558
AN OVERALL CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:44.627
MAKING THE UTILITIES SKINNIER IN

01:07:44.693 --> 01:07:46.395
THIS RESPECT TURNING THEM INTO

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:47.530
MORE WIRES COMPANIES.

01:07:47.596 --> 01:07:49.298
ON THE OTHER BACKSTOPS MECHANISM

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:50.766
IS THE CALIFORNIA ISO THEY DO

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:51.901
BACKSTOP RETIREMENT FOR

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:53.135
RELIABILITY.

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:54.437
THROUGH SINGLE YOUR CONTRACTS

01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:55.237
AND MAY BE THROUGH MULTI YEAR

01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:56.539
CONTRACTS WHAT WHAT'S THE

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:58.541
PROBLEM WITH RELYING MORE ON THE

01:07:58.607 --> 01:08:00.042
CALIFORNIA I SO --

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:01.277
THEIR DECISIONS AREN'T SUBJECT

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:02.545
TO REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY ANY

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:03.813
STATE AGENCY.

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:05.047
OR BY THIS LEGISLATURE.

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:06.582
THE REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:07.883
ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION.

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:11.654
SO GREATER RELIANCE ON THE ISO

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.855
TO PERFORM THE CENTRAL ROLE.

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.123
EFFECTIVELY MEANS TURNING OVER

01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:17.126
MORE RESPONSIBILITY TO FORK AND

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:18.928
ESPECIALLY WITH THE FOR THAT WE

01:08:18.994 --> 01:08:20.529
HAVE TODAY IN THE APPOINTEES --

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:21.764
WHO ARE CONTROLLING THE PROCESS

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:23.265
THERE I DON'T THINK CALIFORNIA

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:25.234
WANTS TO SEE MORE HAVE ALREADY

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:26.602
TO THAT AGENCY AT THIS TIME?

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:27.503
ESPECIALLY SINCE BURKE HAS

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:29.939
EXPRESSED A STRONG PREFERENCE.

01:08:30.005 --> 01:08:31.674
FOR CENTRALIZED FORWARD CAPACITY

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.075
MARKETS THAT HAD BEEN WIDELY

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.610
CRITICIZED IN THE EAST FOR

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:36.212
RAISING CUSTOMER COSTS AND

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:37.613
FRUSTRATING STATE RESOURCE

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.714
PLANNING GOALS.

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.249
SO THE NEXT STEP SHOULD BE THE

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:41.584
CONSIDERATION OF A SEPARATE

01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:43.652
ENTITY. TO PERFORM THIS

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:45.120
DEDICATED PROCUREMENT ON A

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:46.822
BACKSTOPS BASIS IT COULD EITHER

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:48.257
BE MANDATORY PROCUREMENT THAT

01:08:48.324 --> 01:08:49.692
THE LEGISLATURE SAYS MUST

01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:50.626
HAPPENING CAN'T BE EASILY

01:08:50.693 --> 01:08:52.361
ALLOCATED.

01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:53.696
IT COULD BE COORDINATED

01:08:53.762 --> 01:08:55.731
PROCUREMENT OF RESOURCE ADEQUACY.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:56.966
I COULD BE CURING ON MATTER

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:58.701
RESIDUAL NEED THAT'S IDENTIFIED

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:00.035
IN THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:02.238
PLANNING PROCESS AND COULD ALSO

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:04.240
BE A VOLUNTARY OPT AN ENTITY.

01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:05.207
FOR LOW SERVING ENTITIES THAT

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:06.609
NEED HELP MEETING FOR EXAMPLE

01:09:06.675 --> 01:09:08.511
THEIR LONG TERM CONTRACT

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:10.179
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE OUR PS.

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:11.547
THE BIG QUESTION IS THIS A STATE

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:13.415
AGENCY OR IS IT AN INDEPENDENT

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:14.250
NONPROFIT I THINK THAT'S A

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:16.118
QUESTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.186
GOING TO HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH --

01:09:17.253 --> 01:09:18.621
IF A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS MOVES

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:22.324
FORWARD AT THE END OF THIS IS TO

01:09:22.391 --> 01:09:24.260
HAVE A ROBUST MECHANISM.

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:25.728
WELL WE ALSO PRESERVE THE

01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:27.463
AUTONOMY OF COMMUNITY CHOICE

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:29.031
AGGREGATORS AND ELECTRIC SERVICE

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:30.766
PROVIDERS TO MAKE THEIR OWN

01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:32.401
RESOURCE PLANNING CHOICES.

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:33.936
I THINK THIS OFFERS AN APPROACH

01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:36.205
THAT CAN RECONCILE A LOT OF OUR

01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:38.107
COMPETING OBJECTIVES --

01:09:38.173 --> 01:09:39.508
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS

01:09:39.575 --> 01:09:40.242
WE NEED TO DEVELOP THIS

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:42.478
MECHANISM BEFORE THE NEXT CRISIS

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:43.145
HITS.

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:44.680
ON THE MISTAKE OF THE ENERGY

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:46.582
CRISIS WAS THAT WE TRY TO

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:48.117
RESTRUCTURE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IN

01:09:48.183 --> 01:09:49.652
REAL TIME WHILE MARKETS WERE

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:51.987
MELTING DOWN WE CAN'T AFFORD TO

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:52.855
WAIT THAT LONG.

01:09:52.922 --> 01:09:55.024
WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT AHEAD

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:57.560
OF THE CURVE THIS TIME THANK YOU.

01:09:57.626 --> 01:09:59.895
THANK YOU NOW WILL GO --

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:02.965
TO DâN WHITES OF WITH THE THE

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.466
CLEAN ENERGY CALIFORNIA CLEARLY

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:06.402
CHOICES SO SITUATION AND KENDALL

01:10:06.468 --> 01:10:08.103
HOW LONG.

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:09.805
OF WOULD SEND US ELECTRIC.

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:13.943
IF WE CAN.

01:10:14.009 --> 01:10:14.476
MAKE ROOM HERE IN THE DíAS

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:16.612
THINK.

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:18.147
THE MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS

01:10:18.213 --> 01:10:20.249
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:21.684
SPEAK WITH THE COMMITTEE TODAY.

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.052
MY NAME IS DONNA EYES AND I'M

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:24.720
THE PRESIDENT OF KELSEY CA AND

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:27.056
ALSO THE CEO OF AND C. E. THE

01:10:27.122 --> 01:10:28.424
FIRST COMMUNITY CHOICE PROGRAM

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.559
FORMED IN CALIFORNIA BACK IN TWO

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:32.194
THOUSAND AND EIGHT AT TODAY

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:33.996
THEIR NINETEEN CALIFORNIA CCA'S

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.698
IN OPERATIONS SERVING AN ANNUAL

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:36.398
LOAD.

01:10:36.465 --> 01:10:38.434
OF THIRTY THREE THOUSAND

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:39.568
GIGAWATT HOURS PER YEAR.

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:41.203
THAT'S ABOUT EQUAL TO THE LOAD

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:42.771
SERVED BY P. JEANNIE WHICH IS

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:44.173
NOW.

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:45.307
380-00 AND IT'S A QUARTER OF THE

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:48.110
LOAD OF ALL THREE INVESTOR OWNED

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:49.411
UTILITIES OR AREAS.

01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:51.981
SO CLEARLY WE ARE IN THE MIDST

01:10:52.047 --> 01:10:54.883
OF A TREMENDOUS PARADIGM SHIFT.

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:56.986
WHEN THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHED

01:10:57.052 --> 01:10:59.321
CCA BY -- IS

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:00.789
A VISION TO LOCALIZE AND

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:03.392
DEMOCRATIZE THE ENERGY SECTOR.

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:05.160
TODAY THE ENERGY LANDSCAPE HAS

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:07.463
REINVENTED ITSELF BUT THE

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:09.465
REGULATORY LANDSCAPE HASN'T

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:10.799
QUITE CAUGHT UP.

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:12.735
THE CPUC WAS SET UP TO PROTECT

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:14.503
THE PUBLIC AGAINST THE INHERENT

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:16.538
PROFIT DRIVE OF I'LL.

01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:19.108
AND TO TRY AND KEEP GIANT

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:20.309
UTILITIES FROM FAILING.

01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:22.311
THAT REGULATORY MODEL RELIES ON

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:24.279
CENTRAL DECISION MAKING TOP DOWN

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:26.148
DIRECTION AND EXERTING CONTROL

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:28.651
OVER LARGE POWER PROVIDERS.

01:11:28.717 --> 01:11:29.952
THE MODEL IS NECESSARY WHEN

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:31.420
DEALING WITH LARGE FOR PROFIT

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:33.422
UTILITIES BUT IT FALLS APART

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:34.890
WHEN IT'S APPLIED TO SMALL AND

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:37.960
MID SIZED PUBLIC POWER PROVIDERS.

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:39.595
BECAUSE THIS NEW MODEL.

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:40.929
IS SET UP WITH THE DIRECT WITH

01:11:40.996 --> 01:11:42.698
THE PUBLIC HAVING DIRECT INPUT

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:44.433
INTO THE ELECTRIC PROVIDERS

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.168
DECISIONS AND THE PUBLIC

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:47.936
CONTROLS THE LOCAL GOVERNING

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.605
BOARDS MADE UP OF MAYORS CITY

01:11:49.672 --> 01:11:52.107
COUNCIL MEMBERS AND COUNTY

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:53.342
SUPERVISORS.

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:54.743
ELECTRIC SUPPLIERS ARE

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:56.278
INHERENTLY MORE TRANSPARENT AND

01:11:56.345 --> 01:11:58.147
ACCOUNTABLE AS WE ARE GOVERNED

01:11:58.213 --> 01:11:59.982
BY THE BROWN ACT AND THE PUBLIC

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:01.183
RECORDS ACT.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:02.484
OUR CUSTOMERS AND LOCAL

01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:03.819
GOVERNING BOARDS HAVE ALREADY

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:05.554
BUILT ENERGY AGENCIES THAT ARE

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:07.056
INTIMATELY ORIENTED TOWARDS

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:08.857
REASONABLE COSTS FINANCIAL

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:10.893
STABILITY AND EXCEEDING STATE

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:13.362
STANDARDS FOR RENEWABLES AND GHG

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:14.596
REDUCTION.

01:12:14.663 --> 01:12:16.665
WE ACTUALLY HAVE MORE RENEWABLES

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:18.567
AND GHG FREE POWER IN OUR

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:19.835
PORTFOLIO THAN THE I'LL USE

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:22.971
TODAY WITH LONG TERM CONTRACTS.

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:24.673
WHEN THE CPC REGULATORY CULTURE

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:26.942
IS APPLIED TO PUBLIC AGENCIES

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.011
THE TOP DOWN MODEL DRIVES UP

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:31.780
COSTS FLOWS DOWN PROGRESS AND

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:34.016
PREVENTS CREATIVE TRANSPARENT

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:35.517
LOCAL SOLUTIONS?

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:37.653
IS NOT INHERENTLY BAD SYSTEM BUT

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.788
IT WON'T WORK IN THE CURRENT

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:41.090
CONTEXT.

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:42.057
AND WEN WE ADD IN P. GENIES

01:12:42.124 --> 01:12:44.226
MULTIPLE SAFETY FINANCIAL AND

01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:45.861
CREDIT FAILURES.

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:47.629
AS WELL AS THE CLOSE REGULATOR

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:49.531
RELATIONSHIP MANY HAVE NOTICED

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:52.201
BETWEEN P. JEANNIE AND THE CPSC.

01:12:52.267 --> 01:12:54.837
I AGREE THAT IT'S TIME TO

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:56.004
REVISIT THE REGULATORY FOCUS.

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:56.972
WHAT'S EXCITING IS THAT WE'RE

01:12:57.039 --> 01:13:00.509
SEEING THE NEW OUT OF THE OLD.

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:01.777
ENERGY DEMOCRACY THAT WAS

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:03.779
ENVISIONED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:05.214
TWO THOUSAND AND TWO IS TAKING

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.049
ROOT ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND ITS

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:08.484
ACCELERATING PROGRESS TOWARDS

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.953
CALIFORNIA'S RENEWABLE AND GHG

01:13:11.019 --> 01:13:12.387
FREE GOALS WHILE USING A

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:13.489
TRANSPARENT.

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:16.125
PUBLIC BOTTOM UP FREE MARK.

01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:17.359
THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO TO

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:19.228
ADJUST TO THE NEW PARADIGM FOR

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:20.162
TODAY I HAVE JUST THREE

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:22.931
RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST IS

01:13:22.998 --> 01:13:24.399
THAT THE CPC SHOULD NARROW THEIR

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:27.336
FOCUS. TO SAFETY AND I OWE YOU

01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:30.205
COST MANAGEMENT TO PROTECT RATE

01:13:30.272 --> 01:13:30.973
PAYERS.

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:32.808
THIS MEANS IS THAT THEY WILL

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:35.210
ENSURE OR THEY SHOULD ENSURE

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:36.812
THAT THE I'LL USE ARE SELLING

01:13:36.879 --> 01:13:38.313
OFF ENERGY AND RELIABILITY

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:41.016
RESOURCES THEY NO LONGER NEED.

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:43.185
AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC AGAINST

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:44.620
I. O. U. MARKET POWER.

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:47.489
THAT MEANS MINIMIZING --

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.091
THE LOS SUNK COSTS AND

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:51.093
MAXIMIZING THE VALUE OF THEIR

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.796
POWER FOR RATE PAYERS.

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:54.596
THE IDEA YOU SHOULDN'T BE

01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:56.431
SELLING OFF VALUABLE LONG TERM

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:58.634
POWER CONTRACTS INTO THE SPOT

01:13:58.700 --> 01:13:59.868
MARKET.

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:01.470
THEY SHOULDN'T BE ENGAGING IN AD

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:03.172
HOC LOW COST SALES WITHOUT A

01:14:03.238 --> 01:14:05.107
BROADER PLAN AN EXAMPLE OF THAT

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:06.475
WOULD BE THE DEER PARK HYDRA

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:07.843
FACILITY BEING SOLD OFTEN

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.778
PLASTER COUNTY WITH THE SALE

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:10.712
PRICE OF ONE DOLLAR.

01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:12.181
AND NO APPARENT PUBLIC

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:13.382
SOLICITATION.

01:14:13.448 --> 01:14:15.751
THE CPUC SHOULD ALSO BE ENSURING

01:14:15.818 --> 01:14:17.920
DATA TRANSPARENCY FOR TIME OF

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:20.088
USE RATE DESIGN TAKING ADVANTAGE

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:22.024
OF THE SMART METERS THAT OUR

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:23.792
RATE PAYERS ALL PAID.

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:24.560
FOR AND TO ALLOW FOR LOW

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:26.995
SHIFTING PROGRAMS AND ALSO TO

01:14:27.062 --> 01:14:28.564
ENSURE THAT WILD FIRE BASED DE

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:30.699
ENERGIZING OF POWER LINES.

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:33.635
HAPPENS IN A PROACTIVE WAY.

01:14:33.702 --> 01:14:36.405
MY SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS THAT

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:38.373
THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY OF THE

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.175
COMMISSION THE CDC TO TAKE OVER

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:41.810
PUBLIC CCA ENERGY PLANNING

01:14:41.877 --> 01:14:43.445
ACTIVITIES REPORTING AND

01:14:43.512 --> 01:14:44.446
OVERSIGHT.

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:45.247
THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:47.683
TRANSITIONAWAY FROM THE CPSC TO

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:50.219
ALLOW THEM TO FOCUS ON SAFETY

01:14:50.285 --> 01:14:51.987
AND I OWE YOU COST MANAGEMENT.

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:52.654
FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE I'LL

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:54.957
USE WILL HAVE VIRTUALLY NO ROLE

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:56.358
IN BUILDING ENERGY OR

01:14:56.425 --> 01:14:58.460
RELIABILITY REACHED RESOURCES.

01:14:58.527 --> 01:14:59.394
THE EASY COORDINATION OF

01:14:59.461 --> 01:15:02.764
INTEGRATED CA IS AND PUBLIC

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:05.167
UTILITIES IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT.

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:07.369
THAN WITH THE CPUC BECAUSE

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:07.836
THAT'S WHO'S DOING THE

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:09.538
PROCUREMENT.

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:10.772
ON THIS POINT ON ALL ALSO NOTE

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:13.075
THAT THE CPC HAS HAD DIFFICULTY

01:15:13.141 --> 01:15:14.743
PROVIDING ACCURATE INTEGRATED

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:16.778
RESOURCE PLANNING TEMPLATES TO

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:19.014
CCS BECAUSE THEIR MODELS ARE SET

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:20.716
UP FOR LARGE I USE.

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:22.117
AS A RESULT THE I. R. P.

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:23.685
TEMPLATES LAST YEAR WERE BEING

01:15:23.752 --> 01:15:25.621
ALTERED IN THE MONTH MONTHS

01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:28.390
WEEKS AND EVEN DAYS LEADING UP

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:29.858
TO THE FILING DEADLINE.

01:15:29.925 --> 01:15:30.759
CCA'S AND PUBLIC UTILITIES

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:32.761
ALREADY REPORT TO THE CDC UNDER

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:35.097
THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD

01:15:35.163 --> 01:15:37.099
FOR OUR RELIABILITY OBLIGATIONS

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:38.533
AND MANY OTHER COMPLIANCE

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.035
OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE.

01:15:40.102 --> 01:15:41.570
PUBLIC AGENCY PLANNING SHOULD BE

01:15:41.637 --> 01:15:43.472
ALL IN ONE PLACE FREEING UP THE

01:15:43.538 --> 01:15:46.541
CPUC TO FOCUS ON SAFETY AND I

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:47.476
OWE YOU OVERSIGHT.

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:49.244
MY THIRD RECOMMENDATION RELATES

01:15:49.311 --> 01:15:50.979
TO RELIABILITY PLANNING AND

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:53.215
SPECIFICALLY IN NEED FOR CLEAR

01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:54.716
REQUIREMENTS WE'VE HEARD A LOT

01:15:54.783 --> 01:15:57.319
ABOUT RELIABILITY WE AGREE THAT

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:57.953
WE ALL NEED TO KEEP THE LIGHTS

01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:59.388
ON THE CHALLENGE WITH

01:15:59.454 --> 01:16:00.822
RELIABILITY IN THE LAST TWO

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:01.757
YEARS.

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:03.492
IS PARTLY DUE TO OUR INTENDED

01:16:03.558 --> 01:16:05.694
TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUEL

01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:08.030
BASED RESOURCES BUT ONE KEY

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:09.431
ISSUE THAT.

01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:10.666
HAS NOT BEEN A BIG PART OF THE

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:12.467
CONVERSATION IS THE LACK OF

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:15.370
CLEAR REQUIREMENTS FOR LOAD

01:16:15.437 --> 01:16:16.738
SERVING ENTITIES TO FOLLOW.

01:16:16.805 --> 01:16:18.473
JUST LIKE ENERGY PLANNING WE

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:19.975
SHOULD SHIFT RELIABILITY

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:22.277
PLANNING AWAY FROM THE CPUC AND

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:24.146
CREATE CLEAR REQUIREMENTS OR A

01:16:24.212 --> 01:16:25.280
LIABILITY.

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:26.615
A DEFINED BY CASE SO BECAUSE

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:27.849
THEY HAVE BETTER MARKET

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:29.284
INTELLIGENCE.

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:30.686
AS WEST WITH THE PLANNING

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:32.654
FUNCTION ABOVE THE CPC IS NOT

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:33.789
EQUIPPED TO CORRECTLY MANAGE

01:16:33.855 --> 01:16:35.657
RELIABILITY AND IT ONLY TAKES

01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:36.725
AWAY FROM WHAT SHOULD BE THEIR

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:40.829
CORE FOCUS ON SAFETY AND HOW YOU

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:42.264
COST MANAGEMENT --

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:43.298
IF I MAY PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OVER

01:16:43.365 --> 01:16:45.467
THE LAST TWO YEARS THE CPUC HAS

01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:47.102
CHANGED RELIABILITY FILING

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:48.537
REQUIREMENTS WITHIN MONTHS OF

01:16:48.603 --> 01:16:50.605
THE FILING DEADLINE AFTER MANY

01:16:50.672 --> 01:16:52.107
LOW SERVING ENTITIES HAD ALREADY

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:54.710
PROCURED. TO MAKE THINGS WORSE

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:56.545
LAST FALL THE CPC THAN REDUCE

01:16:56.611 --> 01:16:58.480
THE REQUIRED ALLOCATION SEVEN

01:16:58.547 --> 01:17:00.916
DAYS AFTER THE FILING DEADLINE

01:17:00.983 --> 01:17:03.685
COSTING CCA'S SEVEN POINT NINE

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:06.989
MILLION DOLLARS OF ACCESS

01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:08.724
RELIABILITY PROCUREMENT.

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:10.058
WITH CLEAR STANDARDS SET BY CHI

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:11.526
SO THE RELIABILITY NEEDS SHOULD

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:13.462
BE MET BUT ANY RESIDUAL NEED NOT

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:15.197
COVERED COULD THEN BE PURCHASED

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:18.367
BY HI SO OR A THIRD PARTY.

01:17:18.433 --> 01:17:19.801
JUST LAST MONTH FIVE TO SEE IF

01:17:19.868 --> 01:17:21.536
YOU CAN WRAP UP NOW ABSOLUTELY

01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:22.738
I'M JUST OF THE TALENT HERE

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:24.239
WANTED TO NOTE THAT JUST LAST

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:25.674
MONTH FIVE CCA'S ISSUED A

01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:28.877
SOLICITATION FOR JOINT ARE A

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:30.345
LOOKING TO BUY A BIG CHUNK OF

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:31.713
RELIABILITY.

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:35.183
AND THEIR COMBINED LOTUS TWENTY

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:36.551
THOUSAND WHAT HOURS.

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:37.719
PRETTY BACK ABOUT HALF THE SIZE

01:17:37.786 --> 01:17:39.621
OF P. JEANNIE ONE LAST NOTE THE

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:40.655
WILDFIRE THREAT THAT WILL CAUSE

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:42.791
MORE ROUTINE AUTOMATIC OUTAGES

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:44.359
IN FIRE PRONE AREASWILL

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:46.094
JEOPARDIZE RELIABILITY FOR

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:47.362
CRITICAL CUSTOMERS LIKE

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:49.431
HOSPITAL'S EMERGENCY CENTERS AND

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:51.033
MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS.

01:17:51.099 --> 01:17:52.667
CCA'S WANT TO PARTNER WITH THE

01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:54.936
CPUC AND I'LL USE TO BUILD IN

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:57.305
BACKUP SUPPLY AND RESILIENCY BUT

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:58.974
WE NEED ACCESS TO DATA AND WE

01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:00.409
NEED JOINT COOPERATION TO

01:18:00.475 --> 01:18:03.045
SUCCEED. FOR OUR SHARED

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:03.578
COMMUNITIES.

01:18:03.645 --> 01:18:05.113
WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:05.580
THIS COMMITTEE AND THE

01:18:05.647 --> 01:18:08.350
LEGISLATURE AS WE ENTER THE NEW

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:08.917
PARADIGM THANK YOU WAS GOING

01:18:08.984 --> 01:18:12.254
HOME.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.422
RIGHT GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN

01:18:13.488 --> 01:18:14.056
HUESO AND MEMBERS OF THE

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:15.257
COMMITTEE.

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:16.725
I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:18.360
DISCUSS ENERGY SUPPLYING

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:19.094
CALIFORNIA AND HOW IT WILL

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:20.996
EVOLVE TO MEET BOTH STATE AND

01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:22.164
CUSTOMER INTERESTS.

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:23.532
I PLAN ON ADDRESSING THREE

01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:25.934
TOPICS TRENDS IN SAN DIEGO A

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:28.103
CENTRAL BUYER AND THE PROVIDER

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:29.871
OF LAST RESORT.

01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:31.640
LET ME BEGIN WITH AN UPDATE ON

01:18:31.706 --> 01:18:33.041
DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR TERRITORY.

01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:34.709
ON FEBRUARY TWENTY FIFTH THE SAN

01:18:34.776 --> 01:18:37.079
DIEGO CITY COUNCIL VOTED TO MOVE

01:18:37.145 --> 01:18:38.380
FORWARD WITH CCA THROUGH

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:40.015
ESTABLISHMENT OF A JOINT POWERS

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:42.584
AUTHORITY INTENDED TO INCLUDE

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:43.118
OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN THE

01:18:43.185 --> 01:18:44.453
COUNTY.%

01:18:44.519 --> 01:18:45.487
THEIR GOAL IS TO BE UP AND

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:46.822
RUNNING AND PROVIDING ENERGY TO

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:49.958
CUSTOMERS BEGINNING IN.

01:18:50.025 --> 01:18:50.592
TWENTY TWENTY ONE IF WE INCLUDE

01:18:50.659 --> 01:18:52.828
JURISDICTIONS WITH ANTICIPATED

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:54.096
INTEREST IN THIS THE SAME MODEL

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:55.630
AND CUSTOMER SURVEY THE ONE

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:57.666
OPERATING CCA AND OUR TERRITORY

01:18:57.732 --> 01:18:59.267
AND DIRECT ACCESS.

01:18:59.334 --> 01:19:00.602
ESTY GINNY COULD BE LEFT SERVING

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:04.372
ROUGHLY 20% OF LOAD IN OUR

01:19:04.439 --> 01:19:05.907
TERRITORY IN JUST A FEW YEARS.

01:19:05.974 --> 01:19:06.775
THIS TREND IS NOT INCONSISTENT

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:08.210
WHAT WITH WHAT WE ARE SEEING

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:09.644
ACROSS THE STATE WHERE BY ENERGY

01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:11.680
SUPPLY IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY

01:19:11.746 --> 01:19:13.215
DECENTRALIZED.

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:14.583
IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE MOVING TO A

01:19:14.649 --> 01:19:16.051
MODEL WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:19:16.118 --> 01:19:18.854
OVER FIFTY CC IS AN EXPANSION

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:21.022
AND THE DIRECT ACCESS PROGRAM.

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:22.190
AS A RESULT THE I'LL USE WILL

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:24.126
PLAY A SMALLER ROLE IN

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:26.061
PROCUREMENT GOING FORWARD. FOR

01:19:26.128 --> 01:19:27.262
EXAMPLE AS THE GENIE IS

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:28.763
CURRENTLY NOBLE PERCENTAGE IS

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:31.666
AROUND 45% WELL AHEAD OF OUR

01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:33.635
COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS.

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:35.303
WITH ANTICIPATED LOW DEPARTURE

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:36.671
OUR MODELS NOW SHOWN THAT ARE

01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:37.839
NEED TO PROCURE RENEWABLE

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:40.075
RESOURCES AS EXTENDED FROM THE

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:41.877
MIDTWENTY TWENTIES TO WELL

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:43.645
BEYOND.

01:19:43.712 --> 01:19:44.646
TWENTY THIRTY WELL OUR FORECAST

01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:46.014
AND ENERGY SUPPLY NEEDS ARE

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:47.649
DECREASING PROCUREMENT BY NOT A

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:49.117
YOU PROVIDERS IS EXPECTED TO

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:52.287
RISE AS DESCRIBED BY PRESIDENT

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:54.923
PICKER AND MAIN CLEAN ENERGY.

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.991
AS THE STATE MOVES FORWARD WITH

01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:57.392
DECENTRALIZED PROCUREMENT A KEY

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.194
ISSUE ACING LEGISLATORS AND

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:00.629
REGULATORS IS COORDINATION OF

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:02.364
THAT PROCUREMENT TO MEET A

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:03.932
SINGLE GOAL BJ'S TO REDUCTION OF

01:20:03.999 --> 01:20:05.267
RELIABILITY.

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.468
THIS COORDINATION QUESTION

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:08.637
BRINGS ME TO AN IMPORTANT PART

01:20:08.703 --> 01:20:10.172
OF OUR VISION.

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:10.605
WITH THE IDEAS HAVE

01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:11.640
TRADITIONALLY PROVIDED

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:13.575
OPERATIONAL RESOURCES AND THE

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:14.910
BALANCE SHEET TO LEAD

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:16.411
LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:17.712
DIRECTED PROCUREMENT.

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:20.348
WE RECOMMEND THAT GOING FORWARD

01:20:20.415 --> 01:20:20.949
THE EMERGING PLAYERS LEAD THE

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:21.983
WAY.

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:23.451
IT WILL BE IMPORTANT AT ALL --

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:24.553
THIRTEEN ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO

01:20:24.619 --> 01:20:26.655
THE SAME RELIABILITY AND CHASE

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:28.323
TO PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS.

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:29.457
BUT WHEN THERE IS A GAP BECAUSE

01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:32.694
OF DECENTRALIZED A STATE SPECIAL

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:34.129
PURPOSE ENTITY OR CENTRAL BUYER

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:36.097
COULD BE RELIED UPON TO PICK

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.532
YOUR RESIDUAL NEEDS.

01:20:37.599 --> 01:20:39.034
THE SCOPE FUNCTIONALITY AND

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.735
GOVERNANCE OF THE CENTRAL BUYERS

01:20:40.802 --> 01:20:42.571
PARAMOUNT TO SUCCESS THE LET ME

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:44.506
STATE A FEW POINTS ABOUT OUR

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:45.473
POSITION.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.442
FIRST RELATES TO THE QUESTION OF

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:49.010
WHO WILL BE THE CENTRAL BUYER.

01:20:49.077 --> 01:20:50.045
WE BELIEVE THE ENTITY MUST BE

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:51.646
INDEPENDENT AND FINANCIALLY

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:54.082
VIABLE WITHOUT INDEPENDENCE OF

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:55.183
THE FUNCTION IS PARTICULARLY

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:57.118
VULNERABLE TO LITIGATION AND

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:58.220
DISPUTE.

01:20:58.286 --> 01:20:59.521
AND WITHOUT THE FINANCIAL

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:01.122
BACKING TO SECURE RESOURCE FOR

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:02.757
FOUR BROAD STREET NEEDS BROAD ST

01:21:02.824 --> 01:21:04.859
MEANS THE FUNCTION CANNOT BE

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:07.229
RELIED UPON AS A SAFETY NET.

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:08.563
SECOND RELATES TO THE QUESTION

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:09.698
OF WHAT WILL BE PROCURED.

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:11.099
WE BELIEVE THE ENTITY SHOULD

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:12.901
BACKSTOP RELIABILITY AND GT

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:14.469
REDUCTION GOALS BUT THAT CENTRAL

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:15.837
PROCUREMENT SHOULD BE LIMITED IN

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:17.172
SCOPE THE COLLECTIVE

01:21:17.239 --> 01:21:19.641
DEFICIENCIES RESULTING ONLY

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:20.609
AFTER OTHER LOW SERVING ENTITIES

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:22.711
HAVE MADE THEIR PORTFOLIO

01:21:22.777 --> 01:21:24.512
DECISIONS.

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:25.146
THIRD RELATES TO WHY S.

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:26.581
DETAINEES SHOULD NOT SERVE IN

01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:27.716
THIS FUNCTION.

01:21:27.782 --> 01:21:29.384
BESIDES FAILING TO MEET THE

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:30.585
INDEPENDENT STANDARD AS

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:32.120
DETAINEES SHOULD NOT SEEK TO

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:33.888
REGULARLY TAKE ON MULTI MILLION

01:21:33.955 --> 01:21:35.824
DOLLAR COMMITMENTS FOR CUSTOMERS

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:37.659
THAT HAVE CHOSEN A DIFFERENT

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:38.693
ENERGY PROVIDER.

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.462
INSTEAD WE BELIEVE IT MAKES MOST

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:42.397
SENSE FOR US TO FOCUS ON SAFE

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:43.798
AND RELIABLE DELIVERY OF CLEAN

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:44.666
ENERGY.

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:46.368
INCLUDING THE INVESTMENTS NEEDED

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:48.603
TO INTEGRATE HIGHER LEVELS OF

01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:50.605
CLEAN ENERGY ON THE GRID.

01:21:50.672 --> 01:21:52.207
IN FACT AT A BROAD LEVEL WE

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:53.708
BELIEVE IT IS BEST FOR ALL

01:21:53.775 --> 01:21:56.044
STAKEHOLDERS IF WE ACCEPT THE

01:21:56.111 --> 01:21:57.312
ROLE OF ENERGY SUPPLY.

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:59.948
ENERGY SUPPLY ALTOGETHER.

01:22:00.015 --> 01:22:01.683
AS WE CONSIDER THE OPTION IT IS

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:02.651
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WE

01:22:02.717 --> 01:22:04.552
CURRENTLY ACTIVISTS PROVIDER OF

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:06.221
LAST RESORT A POLAR.

01:22:06.288 --> 01:22:07.088
WITH THIS TERM I'M REFERRING TO

01:22:07.155 --> 01:22:08.990
THE OBLIGATION TO SERVE OUR

01:22:09.057 --> 01:22:10.825
CUSTOMERS AND OUR TERRITORY WHO

01:22:10.892 --> 01:22:12.927
ARE NOT SERVED BY ANOTHER LEAD

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:13.795
SERVING ENTITY.

01:22:13.862 --> 01:22:15.530
CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.065
WHO WILL PROVIDE FULLER SERVICE

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:18.533
AND AS THE GENIE EXITS

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.668
PROCUREMENT.

01:22:19.734 --> 01:22:20.935
IF WE ESTABLISH THAT ALL THOSE

01:22:21.002 --> 01:22:22.504
SERVING ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO

01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:23.171
THE SAME --

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:24.506
LIABILITY AND CHASE TO

01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:26.041
PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS.

01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:27.676
AS WELL AS A CENTRAL PRIOR TO

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:30.145
BACKSTOP ANY GAPS THE POLAR

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:31.613
SERVICE IS SMALLER IN SCOPE.

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.515
SIMPLY PUT THE POLAR SERVICES

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:34.949
LIMITED TO PROCURING DAILY

01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:36.685
ENERGY NEEDS FROM THE CHI SO FOR

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:39.120
A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF CUSTOMERS

01:22:39.187 --> 01:22:40.388
IN THE STATE.

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:40.922
I'VE DONE ELSEWHERE THIS

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:41.690
FUNCTION CAN BE PROVIDED BY A

01:22:41.756 --> 01:22:44.292
WIDE VARIETY OF ENERGY SUPPLIERS

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:46.561
AUCTIONED OFF OR PROVIDED BY THE

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:47.762
CENTRAL BUYERS WELL.

01:22:47.829 --> 01:22:49.130
IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:50.632
EMPHASIZE THAT AS TEACHING HE

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:52.334
RECOGNIZES THE PROCUREMENT

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.135
LANDSCAPE IS CHANGING.

01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:55.704
WE EXPECT IT IS CENTRAL AS MODEL

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:58.340
CAN WORK IF IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY.

01:22:58.406 --> 01:23:00.108
MOST IMPORTANTLY WE BELIEVE NOW

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:02.277
IS THE TIME TO ENSURE THE RULES

01:23:02.344 --> 01:23:03.778
REGULATIONS INSTRUCTIONS ARE PUT

01:23:03.845 --> 01:23:05.647
IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THIS FUTURE

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:06.581
MARKET PLACE.

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:07.782
THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:12.320
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND BEFORE

01:23:12.387 --> 01:23:12.921
WE CHANGE A PANEL JUST WANT TO

01:23:12.987 --> 01:23:13.288
ASK.

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:14.556
EACH OF YOU.

01:23:14.622 --> 01:23:17.292
THE SAME QUESTION I ASKED.

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:18.193
THE REPRESENTED FROM P. JEANNIE

01:23:18.259 --> 01:23:20.295
REGARDING --

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:21.863
THE SEGREGATION AND HOW IT'S

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:23.565
AFFECTING THE MARKET PLACE AND

01:23:23.631 --> 01:23:26.067
WHETHER IT'S CONTRIBUTING.

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:28.169
TO RELIABLE REAL RELIABILITY

01:23:28.236 --> 01:23:29.738
CONCERNS.

01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:31.706
EITHER NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.

01:23:31.773 --> 01:23:33.074
IF YOU COULD JUST.

01:23:33.141 --> 01:23:34.409
BRIEFLY GIVE GIVE ME A RESPONSE

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:36.511
TO THAT.

01:23:36.578 --> 01:23:37.946
SURE THANK YOU SENATOR --

01:23:38.012 --> 01:23:40.515
I THINKA JURY STILL OUT ON WHAT

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:41.616
THE RESULT IS GOING TO BE IN

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:42.751
TERMS OF RELIABILITY WERE

01:23:42.817 --> 01:23:43.818
HEARING ANECDOTALLY ABOUT

01:23:43.885 --> 01:23:45.553
GREATER CHALLENGES OF FINDING

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.021
RESOURCES AND SOME OF THE LOCAL

01:23:47.088 --> 01:23:48.356
AREAS --

01:23:48.423 --> 01:23:49.224
THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN A

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:50.692
SLOWDOWN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:52.160
NEW RESOURCES AND SOME OF THE

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:53.328
LOCAL AREAS THAT ARE NEEDED.

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:55.163
COMBINED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF

01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:56.831
EXISTING FACILITIES ON THIS

01:23:56.898 --> 01:23:58.333
RAISES THE QUESTION OF HOW WE'RE

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.634
GONNA PLAN ESPECIALLY IN THE

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:01.669
LOCAL AREAS TO MEET RELIABILITY

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:06.975
NEEDS AND IF WE IF WE RELY ON A

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:08.576
SYSTEM WHERE EVERYONE GETS TO

01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:09.844
CHOOSE WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING TO

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:11.746
BUY IN THE LOCAL AREA AND BUYS.

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:12.280
A LITTLE BIT OF THIS AND A

01:24:12.347 --> 01:24:13.314
LITTLE BIT OF THAT --

01:24:13.381 --> 01:24:14.816
AND THERE'S NO CENTRALIZED

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:16.217
COORDINATION AROUND THAT WE MAY

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:17.986
VERY WELL GET SUB OPTIMAL

01:24:18.052 --> 01:24:18.787
RESULTS --

01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:20.455
AND UNLESS WE MAKE SURE THAT

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:22.424
GENERATION IS BUILT IN THE RIGHT

01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:23.792
PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME OR WE

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:25.360
HAVE DEMAND SIDE RESOURCES THAT

01:24:25.427 --> 01:24:27.128
CAN PROVIDE THAT SAME FUNCTION.

01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:28.997
WE MIGHT BE HEADING TOWARDS --

01:24:29.063 --> 01:24:30.331
SOME CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:32.300
PRICING AND SO THE GOAL WOULD BE

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:34.636
TO AVOID THAT BUT AGAIN JURY

01:24:34.702 --> 01:24:35.370
STILL OUT.

01:24:35.437 --> 01:24:37.372
THANK YOU.

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:37.906
BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO GINNY'S

01:24:37.972 --> 01:24:40.642
TERRITORY ANY RELIABILITY

01:24:40.708 --> 01:24:42.310
CONCERNS THAT HAVE EMERGED

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:43.945
REALLY RELATE MUCH MORE TO THE

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:45.947
EXISTING GENERATION --

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:47.415
THAT'S NEEDED IN THE LOCAL AREA

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:48.716
GOING FORWARD UNDER TO

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:50.118
CENTRALIZE MODEL I THINK IT'S

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:51.019
VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE

01:24:51.085 --> 01:24:52.520
CENTRALIZED PLANNING.

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.556
AND AND THAT SOME AGENCY OR OR

01:24:54.622 --> 01:24:56.157
THERE'S SOME WAY.

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:58.059
TO ENFORCE THE REQUIREMENT THAT

01:24:58.126 --> 01:24:59.861
ARE PUT UPON AFRAID LOW TECH

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:01.262
UNITY.

01:25:01.329 --> 01:25:02.864
I'M AT ALL RESPOND TO THE

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.599
QUESTION UP FIRST BY CLARIFYING

01:25:04.666 --> 01:25:06.668
THAT WHEN WE DID THE PUBLIC

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:07.469
RECORDS ACT REQUEST REGARDING

01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:11.339
THE WAIVERS THAT WERE FILED IN

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:11.940
TWENTY EIGHTEEN ONE I OWE YOU

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:14.275
FILED A WAIVER FOR A LIABILITY

01:25:14.342 --> 01:25:16.010
ONE D. A CUSTOMER FILED A WAIVER.

01:25:16.077 --> 01:25:17.912
NINETY S. P. IS FILED A WAIVER

01:25:17.979 --> 01:25:19.481
AND ZERO CC IS FILE THE WEATHER

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:20.648
WHAT A WAY FOR SOMEONE TO TO

01:25:20.715 --> 01:25:24.352
CORRECT THE RECORD ON THAT POINT --

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:25.487
WHEN A LARGE ENTITIES SERVING

01:25:25.553 --> 01:25:26.688
HALF THE STATE FAILS IT'S A

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:27.689
DISASTER?

01:25:27.755 --> 01:25:31.226
THIS SEGREGATION IS A AND

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:34.395
ANOTHER VERSION OF DIVERSITY --

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:36.431
IN FINANCE WE ARE TOLD TO

01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:38.900
DIVERSIFY YOUR PORTFOLIO I'M IN

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:39.868
THE ENERGY SECTOR IT'S NO

01:25:39.934 --> 01:25:42.136
DIFFERENT DO YOU BELIEVE IT'S

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:43.471
CREATING RELIABILITY CONCERNS.

01:25:43.538 --> 01:25:45.039
NO I BELIEVE THAT WITH GOOD

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:46.641

ON THE LONG TERM ASSETS WHAT

01:35:10.304 --> 01:35:12.807
THIS DOES IS ELIMINATES THE RISK

01:35:12.873 --> 01:35:15.509
WE CONTINUE TO DOUBLE PROCURE.

01:35:15.576 --> 01:35:17.178
TOO MUCH SOLAR AT NOON AND

01:35:17.244 --> 01:35:18.579
HERE'S THE PROBLEM WE TALK ABOUT

01:35:18.646 --> 01:35:20.281
VOLATILITY OF HIGH PRICES YOU

01:35:20.347 --> 01:35:21.816
ALSO GET VOLATILITY OF LOW

01:35:21.882 --> 01:35:23.017
PRICES.

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:24.585
I'M A PRETTY GOOD QUANTITY THIS

01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:26.854
KIND OF STUFF AND THAT'S WHY G.

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:27.955
AT NOON.

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:29.857
ESPECIALLY IN SOLELY IN IN THE

01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:31.392
VALLEY SWEAR YOU HAVE THIS

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:32.493
ACCESO BACK LECTURES CITY UP AND

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.594
THEN YOU SEE THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:35:33.661 --> 01:35:36.230
POWER AT EIGHT PM BECAUSE YOU

01:35:36.297 --> 01:35:37.765
HAVEN'T EMPOWERED TO SEE AN AYE

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:42.069
SECOND WE NEED TO DE CARBONIZED

EXISTING BUILDING YOUR INVENTORY

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.172
AND IT'S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT

01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:46.540
THAN JUST CHANGING CODES.

01:35:46.607 --> 01:35:47.775

FINANCIAL ANALYST TO QUANTIFY

01:35:55.216 --> 01:35:56.317
TRUE COSTS AND PAY BACK.

01:35:56.383 --> 01:35:58.652
BUT SINCE 50% OF THE P. JEANNIE

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:00.054
NATURAL GAS COURSE SUPPLY TO

01:36:00.121 --> 01:36:01.355
SMALL AND MEDIUM COMMERCIAL

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:03.524
BUSINESSES IS PROVIDED BY CTA'S

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:04.492
LIKE MY COMPANY --

01:36:04.558 --> 01:36:05.793
AND BY THE WAY YEAH WE ARE THE

01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:08.596
LEADING SELLER IN THAT SPACE.

01:36:08.662 --> 01:36:10.164
WE LOSE THAT GAS BUSINESS AT

01:36:10.231 --> 01:36:11.499
LEAST GIVE US A CHANCE TO KEEP

01:36:11.565 --> 01:36:13.234
IT BY SELLING THEM ELECTRICITY

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:14.602
TO OFFSET THE LOSS ON THE GAS

01:36:14.668 --> 01:36:16.103
SEEMS FAIR TO ME.

01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:17.104
ARMED WITH THEIR HOURLY IN

01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:18.572

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:19.840
INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW AND

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:21.342
WHEN THEY USE ENERGY AND THEIR

01:36:21.408 --> 01:36:22.743
FINANCIAL RISK THE CUSTOMER'S

01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:24.645
DECISION BE DRIVEN BY TOTAL

01:36:24.712 --> 01:36:26.013
ENERGY COSTS.

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.681
NOT JUST THE SUPPLY.

01:36:27.748 --> 01:36:30.117
AND WE'LL FINANCES BECAUSE WE DO

01:36:30.184 --> 01:36:31.819
HAVE THE BALLOT SHE TO DO IT AND

01:36:31.886 --> 01:36:34.054
SO DO MY COMPETITORS.

THIRD DELIVERING REAL TIME RATES

01:36:35.856 --> 01:36:37.424
TIED THE CHI SO PRICES IS ALSO

01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:39.026
ESSENTIAL WHILE THE NEW UTILITY

01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:40.995
TERRACE RECOGNIZE THE ENERGY IS

01:36:41.061 --> 01:36:42.663
MOST EXPENSIVE FROM FIVE TO NINE

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:44.832
THIS POSTAGE STAMP SIMPLICITY OF

01:36:44.899 --> 01:36:45.966
ONE PRICE ACROSS THE PERIOD IS

01:36:46.033 --> 01:36:48.135
INSUFFICIENT. TO CHANGE MOST

01:36:48.202 --> 01:36:49.703
CUSTOMERS BEHAVIOR.

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:51.305
BECAUSE THE UTILITY AND THE CPUC

01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:52.907
CANNOT QUICKLY ENOUGH PROVIDE A

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:54.675
REAL TIME TEAR FROM REAL PRICE

01:36:54.742 --> 01:36:55.543
SIGNALS NEED TO SHOW FOR

01:36:55.609 --> 01:36:56.143
CUSTOMERS.

01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:58.279
TODAY THE CCA SIMPLY COPY

01:36:58.345 --> 01:37:00.581
UTILITY RATES LESS ONE OR 2%.

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:01.882
BUT YES P. RATES HAVE TO BE

01:37:01.949 --> 01:37:04.752
BASED THIS AGAINST BECAUSE

01:37:04.818 --> 01:37:06.887
CLIENTS ACTUAL HOURLY USAGE

01:37:06.954 --> 01:37:08.956
THAT'S HOW WE PRICE AND THEN WE

01:37:09.023 --> 01:37:10.424
HAVE A COMPETITOR BUSINESS UP ON

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:11.592
MARGIN RIGHT.

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:13.360
GOOD FOR THE CUSTOMER E. S. P.

01:37:13.427 --> 01:37:14.995
RATES BASED ON THAT REFLECT THE

01:37:15.062 --> 01:37:16.864
TRUE RAMPING COST TO MEET THE

01:37:16.931 --> 01:37:19.099

01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:19.767
PASSES THROUGH THOSE ON

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:21.335
CONTRACTS ARE MITIGATES THEM

01:37:21.402 --> 01:37:22.436
THEMSELVES.

01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:23.637
BETWEEN THE PROFIT MOTIVE OF AN

ESP AND THE BUDGET CONTROL MODE

01:37:26.907 --> 01:37:27.841
ABOUT THE BUSINESS.

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:29.243
DIRECT ACCESS STRIKES THE RIGHT

01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:30.444
BALANCE OF MARKET SIGNALS OF

01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:32.646
BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE FINALLY

01:37:32.713 --> 01:37:34.715
DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO RISK IS

01:37:34.782 --> 01:37:35.683
JUST PRUDENT POLICY WE ALL KNOW

01:37:35.749 --> 01:37:37.251
THAT A TOP DOWN APPROACH OF

01:37:37.318 --> 01:37:38.919
PICKING TECHNOLOGIES OF THE YEAR

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:40.788
AS PRESIDENT PICKER KNOWLEDGE IS

01:37:40.854 --> 01:37:42.189
NOT THE RIGHT WAY CREATING

01:37:42.256 --> 01:37:43.958
SUBSIDIES IS NOT LONG TERM GOING

01:37:44.024 --> 01:37:44.158
TO BE.

01:37:44.225 --> 01:37:46.060
THE BEST READ THE READ THE PCI A

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:48.662
TRANSCRIPTS ON HOW WE ARGUED

01:37:48.729 --> 01:37:50.297
ABOUT THE PRUDENT SEE OF OF PAST

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:51.365
DECISIONS.

01:37:51.432 --> 01:37:52.700
YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE.

01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:54.368
MAGNIFY THE TECHNOLOGY RISK BY

01:37:54.435 --> 01:37:55.736
THE GO TO MARKET RISK OF HAVING

01:37:55.803 --> 01:37:57.972
ONLY ONE OR TWO ALLOWED ENERGY

SUPPLIERS 485% OF THE MARKET.

01:38:01.108 --> 01:38:02.876
MULTIPLY THAT BY THE UNCERTAINTY

01:38:02.943 --> 01:38:05.779
OF THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE CC

01:38:05.846 --> 01:38:06.814
A BUSINESS MODEL.

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.849
AND YOU HAVE A RECIPE THAT'S NOT

01:38:08.916 --> 01:38:10.417
GONNA TASTE VERY GOOD.

01:38:10.484 --> 01:38:11.852
FLAVOR THAT WITH THE UNCERTAINTY

01:38:11.919 --> 01:38:12.886
OF HOW WHEN AND IN WHAT

01:38:12.953 --> 01:38:14.154
CONDITION P. GINNY WILL EXIT

01:38:14.221 --> 01:38:15.456
BANKRUPTCY.

01:38:15.522 --> 01:38:17.458
AND WHAT THE OTHER UTILITIES

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:17.925
WANT TO DO WITH THEIR

01:38:17.992 --> 01:38:19.226
PROCUREMENT FUNCTION.

01:38:19.293 --> 01:38:21.061
WHAT YOU CAN CONTROL IS THE

01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:22.663
NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE OPTIONS A

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:24.398
CUSTOMER HAS AND THAT

01:38:24.465 --> 01:38:25.866
DIVERSIFICATION LIKE A STOCK

01:38:25.933 --> 01:38:27.468
PORTFOLIO QUOTING SOMEONE ELSE

01:38:27.534 --> 01:38:28.535
IS ESSENTIAL TO LONG TERM

01:38:28.602 --> 01:38:29.703
SURVIVAL AND GROWTH?

01:38:29.770 --> 01:38:31.538
RELYING ON MULTIPLE ACTORS TO

01:38:31.605 --> 01:38:33.707
BRING DE CARBONIZATION TO THE

01:38:33.774 --> 01:38:34.975
SCENE I MARKET PLACE SERVES AS A

01:38:35.042 --> 01:38:36.343
BACKSTOP TO THE CHANGING

01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:37.378
LANDSCAPE.

01:38:37.444 --> 01:38:39.747
IN CONCLUSION WE SIMPLY ASK YOU

01:38:39.813 --> 01:38:40.848
FOR WHAT I ASKED THE YEAR ON

01:38:40.914 --> 01:38:42.616
BOND FOR TWO YEARS AGO.

01:38:42.683 --> 01:38:44.551
A TEN YEAR HORIZON TO OPEN UP TO

RIGHT.

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:49.957
SENATOR HERTZBERG. FOUR THOUSAND

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:50.591
IS A GOOD START IN THAT

01:38:50.658 --> 01:38:52.559

MORE DETAIL.

01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:42.403

ACHIEVE ITS CLEAN ENERGY GOALS

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:45.506
WE HAVE TO DO SO IN A MANNER

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:46.940
THAT MAKE SURE ELECTRICITY IS

01:40:47.007 --> 01:40:48.075
AFFORDABLE.

01:40:48.142 --> 01:40:51.278

01:40:52.579 --> 01:40:53.881
RIGHT NOW IS A DISAGGREGATED

01:40:53.947 --> 01:40:56.717
MODEL WHERE WE'RE GONNA CREATE --

01:40:56.784 --> 01:40:58.452
ELECTRICITY PRODUCTS THAT MEET

01:40:58.519 --> 01:40:59.553
CERTAIN CUSTOMERS NEEDS BUT

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.188
MAYBE NOT OTHERS.

01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:02.589
IN THE GRID AS EVERYONE KNOWS IS

01:41:02.656 --> 01:41:04.258
GREATLY INTERCONNECTED THE GREAT

01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:05.859
CANNOT OPERATE INDEPENDENT OF

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:07.261
ONE ANOTHER SO THAT IS WHY

01:41:07.327 --> 01:41:10.330
CENTRAL PLANNING IS ALSO VERY

01:41:10.397 --> 01:41:11.298
IMPORTANT --

01:41:11.365 --> 01:41:12.900
SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:41:12.966 --> 01:41:13.600
WHATEVER THE FORUM.

01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:14.868

CONNECTED TO OTHER KINDS SO --

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:21.041
GRAD THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING IN

01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:23.210
CONCERT TO ACHIEVE OUR SHARED

01:41:23.277 --> 01:41:25.245
GOALS.

01:41:25.312 --> 01:41:26.113
AS A TO DO THIS WE NEED

01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:27.281
COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED --

01:41:27.347 --> 01:41:29.950
UP PLANNING PROCESS SB THREE

01:41:30.017 --> 01:41:30.984
FIFTY CREATED --

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:31.552

01:41:34.388 --> 01:41:36.256
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK.

01:41:36.323 --> 01:41:38.091
HOWEVER THE CCA'S IN HIS PIECE

01:41:38.158 --> 01:41:40.227
OF THE CPC OF SOON WHICH WILL BE

01:41:40.294 --> 01:41:42.162
MORE THAN 50% OF THE CPC'S

01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:43.263
JURISDICTIONAL LOAD.

01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:46.366
HAVE BEEN LARGELY RESISTANT --

01:41:46.433 --> 01:41:48.502
TO HAVING THEIR I. R. PEAS ARE

01:41:48.569 --> 01:41:49.136
AROUND THE PROCUREMENT THAT THEY

01:41:49.203 --> 01:41:50.103
WILL DO --

01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:52.940
DIRECTLY REGULATED BY THE CPC.

01:41:53.006 --> 01:41:54.441
AND THIS IS JUST UNTENABLE OUR

01:41:54.508 --> 01:41:56.009
CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRIC GRID NEEDS

01:41:56.076 --> 01:41:59.012
TO BE PLAN FOR A THOUGHTFUL

01:41:59.079 --> 01:41:59.613
COMPREHENSIVE MANNER.

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:00.247
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:42:00.314 --> 01:42:01.782
EVERYONE IS OPERATING AGAIN AS I

01:42:01.849 --> 01:42:03.150
SAID IN IN CONCERT FOR THE

01:42:03.217 --> 01:42:04.852
BETTERMENT OF ALL.

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:05.886
OF THE GRID IT'S NOT THE

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:07.554
INTERNET.

01:42:07.621 --> 01:42:10.390
IT'S A COMPLEX MECHANISM.

01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:11.492
YOU CAN'T JUST ADD STUFF TO IT

01:42:11.558 --> 01:42:12.960
HOPE IT ALL WORKS IT HAS TO BE

01:42:13.026 --> 01:42:14.261
BUILT IN THE RIGHT LOCATIONS

01:42:14.328 --> 01:42:15.496
WITH THE RIGHT ATTRIBUTES THAT

01:42:15.562 --> 01:42:16.430
HAS TO BE OPERATED FOR THE

01:42:16.497 --> 01:42:17.865
BENEFIT OF EVERYONE NOT FOR A

01:42:17.931 --> 01:42:19.266
FEW.

01:42:19.333 --> 01:42:20.734
AND IT HAS TO BE ESSENTIALLY

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.402
PLAN TO GET THERE.

01:42:22.469 --> 01:42:24.171
SO I I SORT OF TO THE QUESTIONS

01:42:24.238 --> 01:42:25.038
THAT I HEARD EARLIER THAT THE

01:42:25.105 --> 01:42:27.307
CPC DOES NEED MORE AUTHORITY

01:42:27.374 --> 01:42:28.942
OVER OUR E. S. P. ISN'T CCA'S

01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:30.077
FOR SOME ENTITY NEEDS MORE

01:42:30.143 --> 01:42:32.079
AUTHORITY. TO MAKE SURE THE

01:42:32.145 --> 01:42:33.313
COLLECTIVELY ON EVERYTHING

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:35.649
THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED WILL

01:42:35.716 --> 01:42:37.317
ACTUALLY MEET OUR NEEDS.

01:42:37.384 --> 01:42:38.218
THE AMOUNT OF CENTRAL

01:42:38.285 --> 01:42:38.785
PROCUREMENT THAT'S NEEDED I

01:42:38.852 --> 01:42:39.553
DON'T HEAR ANYONE DISAGREEING

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:41.054
ABOUT CENTRAL PROCUREMENT THAT

01:42:41.121 --> 01:42:42.289
THERE IS A NEED FOR IT.

01:42:42.356 --> 01:42:43.056
I'D SAY THE AMOUNT OF SUCH A

01:42:43.123 --> 01:42:44.024
PROCUREMENT THAT WE NEED IS

01:42:44.091 --> 01:42:46.360
DIRECTLY A FUNCTION OF HOW MUCH

01:42:46.426 --> 01:42:47.294
SHE IS PEAS AND CC IS ARE

01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:49.229
WILLING TO BE OVERSEEN AND THEIR

01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:50.197
RETIREMENT.

01:42:50.264 --> 01:42:51.732
IF THEY'RE WILLING TO HAVE A

01:42:51.798 --> 01:42:54.468
FAIR AMOUNT OF REQUIREMENTS THEN

01:42:54.535 --> 01:42:55.736
THE CENTRAL PROCUREMENT CAN BE

01:42:55.802 --> 01:42:57.004
SMALL.

01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:58.705
IF THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO RELY

01:42:58.772 --> 01:43:00.974
ON THEIR CITY COUNCILS AND AND

01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:02.409
COUNTY SUPERVISOR PORTS TO TOM

01:43:02.476 --> 01:43:03.744
WHAT TO BUILD THERE WILL BE

01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:05.112
LARGE GAPS TO DEVELOP HONOR

01:43:05.178 --> 01:43:06.079
SYSTEM.

01:43:06.146 --> 01:43:07.347
AND THE CENTRAL BUYERWILL HAVE

01:43:07.414 --> 01:43:07.981
TO DO A LOT OF PROCUREMENT AND

01:43:08.048 --> 01:43:09.816
OUT IN THAT ENVIRONMENT AND THAT

01:43:09.883 --> 01:43:10.684
WILL BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE FOR

01:43:10.751 --> 01:43:11.985
ALL OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WERE

01:43:12.052 --> 01:43:13.186
EFFECTIVELY DOUBLE PROCURING

01:43:13.253 --> 01:43:14.121
RESOURCES.

01:43:14.187 --> 01:43:15.622
THAT WE COULD HAVE SECURED AT

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:18.792
THE OUTSET OF MET ALL THE NEEDS.

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:19.993
A SIMPLE EXAMPLE I'M IN I'M NOT

01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:21.194
SAYING THIS IS HOW IT WOULD HAVE

01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:23.564
WORKED OUT BUT WE HAVE CCA'S

01:43:23.630 --> 01:43:25.499
RIGHT NOW AND THAT THERE FORMING

01:43:25.566 --> 01:43:27.167
IN SANTA MONICA BEVERLY HILLS.

01:43:27.234 --> 01:43:29.369
ON BUT IF WE NEED RESOURCES IN

01:43:29.436 --> 01:43:31.338
SANTA ANA HER SUPERIA ARE THEY

01:43:31.405 --> 01:43:31.872
GOING TO BUILD THE RIGHT

01:43:31.939 --> 01:43:33.340
RESOURCES IN THOSE LOCATIONS IF

01:43:33.407 --> 01:43:35.242
THEY BUILD THE RESOURCES THAT

01:43:35.309 --> 01:43:36.076
THEIR CUSTOMERS WANT.

01:43:36.143 --> 01:43:37.477
ALL WILL BE GREAT BE RELIABLE

01:43:37.544 --> 01:43:39.046
FOR EVERYONE BUT WE HAVE ROLLING

01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:42.316
BLACKOUTS WE BLACKOUT EVERYBODY

01:43:42.382 --> 01:43:42.983
EXCEPT FOR SOCIAL SERVICE

01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:43.951
CUSTOMERS.

01:43:44.017 --> 01:43:44.651
SO IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

01:43:44.718 --> 01:43:46.420
THAT WE WE DON'T PRETEND THAT

01:43:46.486 --> 01:43:47.621
SOMEHOW LETS SERVING IDEAS ARE

01:43:47.688 --> 01:43:52.025
NOT DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE

01:43:54.027 --> 01:43:55.862
WHO SHOULD BE THE CENTRAL BUYER --

01:52:27.707 --> 01:52:28.975
YOU KNOW A SYSTEM IN OUR STATE

01:52:29.042 --> 01:52:30.877

THOSE OF THE STATE AND OTHERS

01:52:33.947 --> 01:52:34.481
THAT BEAR.

01:52:34.547 --> 01:52:35.882
A HIGHER BURDEN WHETHER IT'S

01:52:36.816 --> 01:52:39.385
RELIABILITY OR HIGHER RATES.

OR IN SHOULDERING THE COSTS OF

01:52:42.722 --> 01:52:44.390
OF OTHER AREAS AND I THINK THAT

01:52:44.457 --> 01:52:46.960
IS SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED.

01:52:47.026 --> 01:52:49.429
REGULARLY IN CALIFORNIA WHETHER

AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND AND HOW

01:52:55.668 --> 01:52:57.971
WE HAVE IMBALANCES IN PROVIDING

01:52:58.037 --> 01:52:59.506
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO PEOPLE IN

01:52:59.572 --> 01:53:02.275
EDUCATION --

01:53:02.342 --> 01:53:03.343
PEOPLE IN HOUSING.

01:53:03.409 --> 01:53:05.512
YOU KNOW I JUST HATE TO SEE US

01:53:05.578 --> 01:53:07.747
CREATE A SYSTEM THAT'S GOING TO

01:53:07.814 --> 01:53:09.582
CREATE INEQUALITY IN ENERGY --

01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:11.317

AND THAT MAY THAT MAY BE THE

01:53:14.621 --> 01:53:17.590
CURRENT ENVIRONMENT NOW.

01:53:17.657 --> 01:53:19.092
BUT IF IT'S GONNA GET WORSE

01:53:19.159 --> 01:53:20.860
UNDER THE THE STATUS QUO RIGHT

01:53:20.927 --> 01:53:22.195
NOW IF NOTHING IS DONE NOTHING

01:53:22.262 --> 01:53:23.530
IS CHANGED IF WE DON'T REALLY

01:53:23.596 --> 01:53:25.932
FOCUS ON WORKING TO CREATE.

01:53:25.999 --> 01:53:29.269

AND I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO DO

01:53:56.196 --> 01:53:57.163
SOMETHING TO ADDRESS OFF THIS

01:53:57.230 --> 01:54:00.200
