COMMISSION ON EARLY EDUCATION WE ARE AT THE AT THE FINAL HEARING THIS MORNING IT SO WE'RE EXCITED -- TO TO SEE ALL THAT THE FACES HERE TO JOIN US TODAY AND UNVEIL OUR OUR OUR PRODUCT HERE TODAY THIS IS ALMOST THE FINAL THE FINAL STAGE BUT THIS IS THE FINAL PUBLIC HEARING. SO THIS OF COURSE IS THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CHATTERJEE EDUCATION AS IT JUST SOME CONTEXT WE'VE HAD A FEW. GOOD YEARS REINVESTING IN THE BUDGET FOR EASY WE KNOW DURING THE GREAT RECESSION ARE YOU SEE PROGRAMS WERE CUT BY ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS WHICH AS SPEAKER NOTICE. SOME AS A REASON WHY OFFICE AND SO WE HAD A REALLY TOUGH PERIOD -- EARLIER THIS DECADE FOR EASY PROGRAMS WE START TO TO RE INVEST IN OUR EASY PROGRAMS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO BUT THE AFTER THE SECOND YEAR OF DOING THAT -- THE SPEAKER AND OUR ASSEMBLY -- BUDGET COMMITTEE THAT TEAM ASIDE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S NICE THAT WE ARE PUTTING MONEY BACK YEAR AFTER YEAR WE NEED TO TAKE A BIG PICTURE AS FAR AS WHERE WE'VE BEEN WHERE WE ARE TODAY THE WAY YOU WANT TO GO IN THE FUTURE IS LOOKING AT A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE. AS FAR AS WHAT'S NEEDED AS FAR AS HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT FOUND THAT. FAMILIES CAN -- AND ROLL THESE PROGRAMS THEY COULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE HOURS WHICH FIT THEN. MAKE SURE THAT PROGRAMS ARE VIABLE -- JUST LAST WEEK WE HEARD THAT ARE SACRAMENTO CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD. TO SHUT DOWN SOME OF THEIR PRE K. PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PROPER RE INVESTMENTS AS FAR AS THE RATES -- PROPER INVESTMENTS IN THE RATES FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE ISSUES AS WELL -- MAKING SURE WE FOCUS ON NOT JUST THE SCHOOL BASED PROGRAM BUT THAT FAMILY CHILD CARE PROGRAMS THAT. THE THE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY SIR THE COMMISSION HELD THANKS OVER THE TWO YEAR PERIOD THROUGH ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND IN PLACES LIKE PALM DESERT LONG BEACH FRESNO SOUTH LA OAKLAND. IN TODAY'S HEARING WILL BE -- POLICY FOCUSED FOCUSING ON THE OUTCOME OF THOSE RESPONSES IN THOSE IN THOSE -- AND THOSE FINDINGS AND WE WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE VISION AND THE POLICIES THROUGH THIS PLAN CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED WITH NEW INVESTMENTS IN ARE YOU SEE -- BUDGET SO WE'RE EXCITED THAT THE GOVERNOR OUT OF THE GATE IS FOCUSED ON THE INCREASE INVESTMENTS EARLY EDUCATION WE KNOW THAT THE ASSEMBLY IS RIGHT THERE WILLING TO PARTNER WITH HIM. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE KNOW THAT YOU SEE MATTERS WE KNOW IT'S A DIFFERENCE MAKER -- FOR FAMILIES WE KNOW IT'S A DIFFERENCE MAKER FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO ENTER THE WORK FORCE WE KNOW IT'S A DIFFERENCE MAKER. IN TRYING TO ADJUST THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND ADDRESS INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY IN THE WORKS AND SO WE HAVE BEFORE US WE THINK IS A GOOD -- PLAN A ROADMAP TO GET US -- THAT WAY I KNOW WE HAVE A A ROBUST HEARING TODAY SO -- WE'RE GONNA START A FEW MINUTES BEFORE BEFORE A BIG GOT BEGIN WE WANT TO ALLOW. OUR CO CHAIRS AND OUR SPEAKER TO LAUGH AND ALSO COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SAY A FEW INTRODUCTORY REMARKS -- BECAUSE YOU'RE RUBIO. THINK HE'S OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE SPEAKER -- AND TO MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE I THINK THAT THE INVESTING IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS. THE WHERE WE NEED TO BE -- AS OF HAPPENS BEFORE CHILDREN ENTER KINDERGARTEN I TAUGHT KINDERGARTEN FOR THREE YEARS SO TRUST ME I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS -- AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT -- FOR ALL OF THE KIDS TO BE PREPARED SO THAT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL AND NOT ONLY FOR THE CHILDREN BUT FOR THE PARENTS AS WELL. I APPRECIATE THE AMBITIOUS GOALS OF ENSURING THAT ALL CHILDREN BIRTH TO FIVE HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. AND A COMMITMENT TO STARTING FIRST -- WITH THE CHILDREN WHO NEED IT MOST. BECAUSE THE FACE OF TOWN THE CHALLENGING -- LIVES OF KIDS ARE BECAUSE OF POVERTY AND I THINK THAT WITH A GROUP GOOD EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION FOUNDATION A GOOD EDUCATION. THOSE ARE THE TOOLS I HAVE TWO LEFT FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY. I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THE REPORT RECOMMENDS THAT WE PRIORITY TO PRIORITIZE -- INVESTMENTS -- MAINLY INFANTS AND TODDLERS -- WHICH IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE TOO MANY OF THE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS AND THE KEY HERE AND I THINK THROUGHOUT -- THE LAST TWO YEARS WE SPOKE ABOUT GRAMS ARM [inaudible] AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE KIDS ARE READY FOR SCHOOL AS WE EXPAND OUR INVESTMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT OUR MOST -- BOOK VULNERABLE CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO TRULY HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO SUPPORT THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT -- WE KEEP HEARING STATISTICS ABOUT HOW CRITICAL THOSE FIRST. YEARS ARE AND I THINK THE COMMISSION HAS DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB MAKING SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THAT POPULATION I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR -- WE WERE VERY EXCITED WHEN HE MENTIONED EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND HIS -- AND HIS -- INAUGURATION SPEECH BUT ALSO THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS MET WITH HIM NOT SO LONG AGO I THINK A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND THE FIRST THING THAT WE ARE ASKED OF HIM WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE KEPT HIS COMMITMENT. TO ARE THOSE PROGRAMS THE FIRST PARTNER WAS THERE AND SHE WAS SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THE WORK THAT THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN DOING. SO TRUST ME SHE WILL HOLD HIM ACCOUNTABLE FOR FOR HIS REMARKS AND WE ASKED HIM FOR A COMMITMENT RIGHT THEN AND THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT HE DOES SUPPORTED AND IT TRULY. IT WASN'T TOO MUCH OF AN ASK HE INDICATED THAT. HE KNOWS WHAT IT IS. I'D TO I AGAIN THANK YOU TO THE COMMISSION FOR THE GREAT WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE AND THANK YOU TO MY FELLOW FELLOW COLLEAGUES. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP PUSHING AND I AM COMMITTED AS I KNOW ON MY COLLEAGUES ARE TO KEEP PUSHING FOR THE INVESTMENT THAT WE NEED FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SO THANK YOU THIS RACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY. I MOST ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK WHAT IS RUNNING. I'M WE HAVE [inaudible] CHEN ABOUT. BECAUSE IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT. WE HAVE. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS GOING TO BE FOR THE CHILDREN -- IT'S IT'S BEEN A TASK THAT WAS UNDERTAKEN I I THINK THE SPEAKER FOR HIS VISION FOR SOMETHING THIS IMPORTANT. I KNOW THIS IS THIS IS BEEN PART OF HIS LIFE. BUT THE FACTTHAT HE HAS NOW PUT TOGETHER THIS BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION TO ALLOW. THE COMMUNITY THE PARENTS AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO GET TOGETHER AND THEN THE AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID FOR TWO YEARS TO SPEND THE TIME TO PUT TOGETHER THIS PARTICULAR REPORT. AND I'D LIKE TO FACT THERE'S A HOLISTIC AND COMPREHENSIVE REPORT ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. DURING THIS TIME THEY HAVE HEARD FROM THE FAMILIES FROM THE PARENTS FROM CHILD CARE PROVIDERS EDUCATORS AND R. K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM. AND SO MANY OTHERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE REPORT. IS THE PRODUCT OF CRITICAL CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE DURING THIS TIME. ALL FOCUSED ON ONE GOAL HOW DO WE BEST PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY AND ACCESSIBLE CHILD HEARD EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. THE NEXT PART THOUGH IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THE REPORT AND THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HEAR YOUR COMMENTARIES TO HELP ENSURE. THAT THE REPORT IS COMPLETE IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER WHAT THE COMMISSIONERS OF PUT TOGETHER IT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THE REPORT. AND BECAUSE YOU BEEN INVOLVED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS YOUR YOUR COMMENTS BECOME THAT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT. I WANT. TO TELL YOU HOW PERSONALLY I EXCITED I AM TO SEE THE ROLL OUT OF THIS THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE POLICY -- WHICH WILL DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. AS CHAIR OF THE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION POLICY THAT PROMOTES EQUITY AND ACCESS WILL BE ONE OF THE TOP PRIORITIES OF MY COMMITTEE. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SPRING FORWARD NOW THAT WE HAVE THE COMPREHENSIVE GUIDELINES THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING. THANK YOU MISS CULTURE -- IT JUST WANTED IS JUST SAY THANK YOU TO ALL THE COMMISSION MEMBERS FOR WITH THE COMPILING JUST VERY COMPREHENSIVE REPORT. I THINK IT HIGHLIGHTS ALL THE VARIOUS ISSUES THAT WE EXPERIENCE EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. THEY REALLY HIGHLIGHTS MANY OF THE CHALLENGES -- THE CHALLENGES WE KNOW ON AUGMENT OUR BUDGET THE LAST COUPLE YEARS TO REALLY SUPPORT MANY OF THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. EFFORTS HOWEVER -- YOU SEE THE REPORT TALK ABOUT THE LACK OF CLASSROOM SPACE A LACK OF INTEGRATION -- INTIMATE CHALLENGES YOU HAVE BECAUSE AT TIMES -- FAMILIES ISOLATED OR THE CENTERS ARE ISOLATED. SO AGAIN -- THIS THIS REPORTERS ARE A GREAT JOB OF LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR OUR AGENDA IN RELIEF FOR OUR DIALOGUE I THINK. THE CHALLENGE WILL BE FOR ALL OF US TO BE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER. IN PUSH FORWARD IN A COHESIVE COORDINATED FASHION SO WE CAN REALLY -- MAKE MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE WE WE KNOW THAT IF WE CAN INVEST EARLY IN CHILDREN. IT PAYS OFF IN HUGE RETURNS DOWN THE ROAD AND SO I THINK WE ARE UP FOR THAT INVESTMENT I THINK WE NEED YOUR HELP. IN REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE THE MOST STRATEGIC THINGS WE CAN BE DOING -- WITH OUR RESOURCES AND WITH. TO CLOSE IT OUT -- THE INSPIRATION BEHIND THIS ENTITY AND SOMEBODY CAME FROM EASY FIELD OF COURSE SPEAKER RENDON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU MEMBERS I'VE -- SURFACE SERVED IN THIS. IN THIS -- BUILDING NOW FOR SIX YEARS AND I'VE HAD SOME. DAYS WHEN I WAS REALLY HAPPY -- SOME DAYS WHEN I WAS REALLY UNHAPPY -- TODAY IS PROBABLY THE FIRST THEY I'VE EVER BEEN. GETTY. THIS IS A REALLY REALLY COOL DAY -- AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU -- ALL OF YOU WHO ARE HERE TODAY ALL OF YOU WHO WERE HERE IN -- IN THE PAST -- THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE IN FRESNO IN LONG BEACH IN COACHELLA AS WE WENT UP AND DOWN THE STATE I WANT TO THANK OUR FELLOW COMMISSIONER FOR ALL OF THEIR HARD WORK. MR MCCARTY MIST -- WORLD CUP SEMI FINAL GAME BETWEEN ENGLAND IN CROATIA. JUST THE TO ADD A TERRIFIC COP -- I KNOW THERE WERE A LOT OF SACRIFICES MADE IN THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INPUT AND WE HAVE A A WONDERFUL DRAFT -- PROPOSAL HERE. AND THIS PROCESS IN THIS DRAFT PROPOSAL WAS ALL ABOUT IT'S ALL ABOUT RESULTS IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING RESULTS. ALL EIGHT HEARINGS OF THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION -- HAVE BEEN GREAT. BUT I'M PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT COMES AFTER THAT WHAT COMES AFTER THIS POINT WHICH IS ABOUT AGAIN GEARED TOWARDS GETTING RESULTS. TODAY WE HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS COMMISSION. JUST AS EXCITING WILL BE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM YOU THE PUBLIC ABOUT OUR CONCLUSIONS. THE ROUTE THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF EXPERTS WE KNOW THAT PARENTS OF PROVIDERS HAVE EXPERTISE AS IMPORTANT AS ANY ACADEMIC OR GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATOR HAS. SO WE MADE SURE THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. THE TOPIC OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS RARELY FAR FROM MY MIND FOR TWO REASONS AS HAS BEEN STATED. PREVIOUSLY THAT'S WHY I RAN FOR OFFICE IT IT'S A FIELD IN WHICH I SPENT. THE FIRST TWENTY YEARS OF MY CAREER. IT UNDERPINS -- IT ALSO DEPENDS SO MUCH OF WISH AS A SOCIETY I'M GLAD THAT WE HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO RECOGNIZES THAT. I SPOKE TO A GROUP OF YOUNG POLITICAL SCIENCE STUDENTS LAST WEEK I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST WEDNESDAY. UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WHOSE SOLE GOAL WAS TO SHAPE THE FUTURE. I SHARED WITH THEM THAT MY CONVICTION THAT IT'S EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THAT TURNS AROUND COMMUNITIES. IT'S EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THAT BREAKS THE CYCLE OF POVERTY IN FAMILIES IT'S EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THAT I THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAM. AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM THAT WE CAN OFFER. IT'S HOW YOU GIVES CHILDREN A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR EDUCATION AND IT'S HOW YOU LOOKED UP FAMILIES. THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION TO LOOK AT IT THROUGH THIS LANDS AND CONSIDERED HOW ECP SHOULD ALLOW INCOME EARNERS TO STAY ON THE JOB. WHETHER THEY WORK DAYS WEEKENDS ARE NICE. AND THAT WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE LOW INCOME FAMILIES TO ENSURE EQUITY OF SERVICES. B. R. SEE TOOK US AWAY FROM THE CONSTANT BUDGET BATTLES INSTEAD FOCUSED ON FIGHTING FOR FOR FIND FIGHTING FOR CONSTANT DOLLARS. BLUE RIBBON INSTEAD OF DOING SO THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION BEGIN BY ASKING WHAT DO WE NEED HOW SHOULD WE WRITE YOU SEE PROGRAMS. THAT AND AGAIN THAT TOOK US AWAY FROM THE CONSTANT BATTLE FOR DOLLARS AND INSTEAD FOCUSES ON FAMILIES AND FOCUSES ON CHILDREN. AND AND THAT'S WHY I'M GETTY TODAY. WE CAN I GET STARTED TOO SOON ON THE IDEAS WE HAVE PRODUCED SONG TO GET OUT OF THE WAY SO WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU. OKAY THAT THANK YOU BEFORE WE BEGIN OUR PANEL I I DID WANT TO RECOGNIZE OUR FELLOW COMMISSIONERS -- THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE HERE TODAY WE HAD COMMISSIONER ALMANAC AHMADI MELON. KHôNG THE NATION IS -- YALA AND ACROSS SKI I ALSO WHEN TWO COMMISSIONERS ARE HERE TODAY BUT THERE AND WASHING DC. LOBBYING FOR EARLY EDUCATION THAT'S COMMISSIONERS ON YOUR COMPASS RIVERA AND COMMISSIONER NEED A BOOTH THEME. I THINK THEY'RE THE GOOD LUCK CHARM BECAUSE THIS MORNING ON THE WAY AND I HEARD ON NPR THAT THE THE PRESIDENT. THE MUCH MALIGNED FOR SOME OF US POLICIES FOR CALIFORNIA. PROPOSING TO INVEST AND NOT IN ADDITIONAL ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CHILD CARE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM ACROSS THE NATION. SO THAT WOULD MEAN ROUGHLY -- CALIFORNIA'S ROUGHLY 10% POPULATION SO YOU KNOW BACK OF THE ENVELOPE AT LEAST A HUNDRED MILLION MORE FOR CALIFORNIA. TO RELATE TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY TO REALIZE WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE THIS IS A COMBINATION OF FEDERAL. STATE AND LOCAL RESOURCES AS WELL AS COURSE -- PARENTS AND BUSINESSES STEP UP AND FILL THE PHILLY FILL THE VOIDS AS WELL SO -- THAT'S SOME GOOD NEWS TO START THIS MORNING SO WE'RE AS ACT AND AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM. PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINES TODAY AND SO WITH THAT WE WANT TO INVITE AT OUR PARENT FOCUS GROUP. TO PROVIDE A PRESENTATION THIS MORNING. THANK YOU. PLEASE BE. MORNING EVERYONE. LARA PRIOR AND SENIOR SAYS IT IS A POLICY RESEARCH. IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY HELLO WHAT'S LIKELY TO HAVE YOU ADD TO THE MIKE PRESSED A LITTLE BUTTON THE OTHER ONE BY YOUR RIGHT HAND HANNAH [inaudible] SELECT COMMITTEE. TESTING. THERE WE GO. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME IS LAURA PRIOR AND I'M A SENIOR ASSOCIATE AT SOCIAL POLICY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES A RESEARCH AND EVALUATION FIRM BASED OUT OF OAKLAND CALIFORNIA. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF PARTNERING WITH PARENTS VOICES ON THIS IMPORTANT PROJECT TOGETHER PARENTS PERSPECTIVES AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO INFORM THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION SUPPORT. FOR IMPROVING EARLY LEARNING IN CALIFORNIA. THIS PROJECT CULMINATED IN A FINAL REPORT TITLED WAITING TO BE SEEN DEMANDING TO BE HEARD. RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WHICH IS NOW PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. BEFORE GIVING A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR PROJECT I WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE NECESSITY OF CENTERING THE PERSPECTIVES OF THOSE MOST IMPACTED BY CHILD CARE POLICIES AND SINCERELY BANK THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION FOR SUPPORTING THIS INVALUABLE EFFORT. SOCIAL POLICY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES AND PARENT VOICES SEE PARENTS AS THE EXPERTS WHEN IT COMES TO CHILD CARE REFORM. AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS WORK WE COMMITTED TO CONDUCTING FOR PARENT FOCUS GROUPS AS A WAY TO LIFT UP AND SHOWCASE PARENTS WITH THEM. AS A MEMBER OF THE RESEARCH AND EVALUATION I KNOW THAT THIS IS A UNIQUE APPROACH. WHILE MANY RESEARCH PROJECTS MAY STRIVE TO INCORPORATE MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT COMMUNITY VOICE IS MEANING POLICE ENTERED AND POLICY RESEARCH. THERE FOR THIS PROJECT PROVIDED A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO LISTEN TO PARENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE AIM TO INCLUDE AS MANY PERRANCE AS POSSIBLE BY MAKING THESE FOCUS GROUPS ACCESSIBLE AND CHILD FRIENDLY. THIS SPENT CONDUCTING THESE FOCUS GROUPS IN THE EVENINGS ON THE WEEKENDS PROVIDING FREE CHILDCARE SPANISH TRANSLATION FOOD IN THE STATE AND FOR PARENTS TIME. IN TOTAL WE CONDUCTED FOR FOCUS GROUPS SPEAKING WITH THIRTY THREE PARENTS IN INGLEWOOD LOS ANGELES THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY FRESNO IN THE BAY AREA. REPRESENTING URBAN SUBURBAN AND RURAL AREAS. THE FRESNO FOCUS GROUP WAS CONDUCTED ENTIRELY IN SPANISH. PARENTS ARE PREDOMINATELY LOW INCOME MOTHERS FROM IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE ALSO HAD TWO FATHERS A TENDER FOCUS GROUPS IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. THESE PARENT EXPERIENCES REPRESENTED EVERY CHILD CARE SETTING INCLUDING CENTER BASED CARE FAMILY CHILDCARE HOMES STATE PRESCHOOL HEAD START IN FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR CARE. ORIGINALLY WE INTENDED TO HOST A FOCUS GROUP IN CHICO HOWEVER THE CAMPFIRE PREVENTED US IN CARRYING OUT THESE PLANS. IF WE ARE TO PRINT IF WE WERE TO CONDUCT A FOLLOW UP PROJECT WE STRIVE TO INCLUDE THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS THE TRIBAL NATIONS OF CALIFORNIA. WE STRUCTURED EACH FOCUS GROUPS THAT IT WOULD BE A CONVERSATION AMONG PARENTS GUIDED BY A FEW OVER ARCHING QUESTIONS WE BEGAN THE FOCUS GROUP BY ASKING PARENTS TO DISCUSS THEIR IDEAL WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING AND KEEPING QUALITY CHILD CARE. IT'S DESCRIBED. A WORLD IN WHICH WAITING LIST DID NOT EXIST WARM HAND OFF FOR PROVIDED THAT PRENATAL APPOINTMENTS MULTIPLE QUALITY CHILDCARE OPTIONS WERE OFFERED AT FLEXIBLE HOURS. IN PARIS RETREAT WITH CARE AND RESPECT GETTING THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM. AFTER DESCRIBING THEIR IDEAL WORLD PARENTS THEN DISCUSS THE ON THE GROUND CHILD CARE REALITIES WHICH ARE FAR FROM IDEAL. PARENTS TOLD STORIES OF FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS DUE TO LOSING ELIGIBILITY WITHOUT BEING NOTIFIED IN STAYING ON WAITING LISTS FOR OVER SEVEN YEARS. YOU CAN READ THE DETAILS OF THE STORIES IN OUR REPORT. MY PARENTS NEVER ENDED THE CONVERSATION THERE. THE FOCUS GROUPS ALWAYS ENDED WITH PARENTS SHARING THE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO IMPROVE THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM. THE PURPOSE WAS NOT JUST TO COLLECT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SAKE OF DOCUMENTATION. BUT TO BRING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE CAPITAL TO BE TURNED IN THE POLICIES THAT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. ALL NOW PASS IT OFF TO MONEY VIA LUNA ONE OF THE PARENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE BAY AREA OF FOCUS GROUP WILL PRESENT ASET OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND EXPLAIN HOW SOME OF THEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN TURNED. INTO CAMPAIGN FOR THIS LEGISLATIVE ACTION THE FULL SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE FOUND IN OUR REPORT WHICH IS AVAILABLE AT THE TABLE BEHIND ME. THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS MAHDI A PART OF THE PAIR PLACES THEIR JUST GO CHAPTER. A SOLO PARENTS OF A THREE YEAR OLD. WAS ALSO NOT FEELING WELL AND WHEN YOUR KID IS SICK. THEY DON'T GO TO CHILD CARE. SO I PARTICIPATING THE BLUE RIBBON PAIR FOCUS GROUP AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER BEEN A FOCUS GROUP OF PARENTS. WITH THE SAME ECONOMIC STRUGGLES. AROUND TALK HERE THAT I HAVE. IT FELT LIKE A SUPPORT GROUP BUT WE WERE HEARD AND OUR EXPERIENCE AS PARENTS. AND AS EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF CHILD CARE WERE VALIDATED TO NOTE TAKING RECORDINGOUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND TO THE PUBLISHING. OF THIS REPORT THE YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY. PLEASE CONSIDER THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AS IF YOU HAD A THINK TANK OR UNIVERSITY. PROFESSOR IN FRONT OF YOU BECAUSE THIS IS FIRST HAND SCHOLARSHIP. IT'S A CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S CHILD CARE SYSTEM. SO WE HEARD A LOT FROM FAMILIES IN THE COW WORK PROGRAM. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE WEIRD A LOT FOR FAMILY THE COWARDS PROGRAM WE LEARNED THAT. THEY WERE TOLD ABOUT CHILD CARE BENEFITS WITH CAL WORKS -- THAT THE PROCESS WAS HARD TO NAVIGATE THAT IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET APPROVED SOME TALK ABOUT HAVING CHILDCARE BUT THEN THEY LOST IT BECAUSE SOMEBODY LOST THEIR PAPERWORK. OR BECAUSE THEY WERE TRANSITION TO STAGE TO CHILD CARE PROPERLY. FOR ME I WAS WORKING MY DREAM JOB. WAS STABLE AND READY. TO HAVE A CHILD. LITTLE DID I KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE IT WAS DARK. LITTLE EXPENSE. LITTLE DID HE KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE AND HARD. TO FIND QUALITY CHILDCARE. I COULDN'T AFFORD IT I HAD TO GO CAL CARE. MY CHILD CARE WAS APPROVED UNTIL TWO MONTHS AFTER I READ IS APPROVED FOR CASH AID. AND BY THAT TIME MY JOB HAD THREE PLEASE. NOT HAVING TO ARGUMENT THE DEATH OF MY CAREER. SO WE WILL BE THAT SENATOR MITCHELL'S SB THREE TWO ONE STRONG SERVER TOWERS FAMILIES WELL SURE THAT NO FAMILY HAS EXPERIENCE LIKE I DID. THIS BILL WOULD APPROVE TALKER AS SOON AS YOU GET CASH IN. AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE IT FOR TWELVE MONTHS JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE TOP HIS SYSTEM. WE ALTERED FOR MANY PARENTS THAT CAN IF I LICENSE STOCK YOU'RE NEAR THEM. SO. THERE PROVIDE THE PROVIDERS ARE PAID SO LITTLE THEY CAN AFFORD TO TAKE THE FAMILY TO SUBSIDIES. AND AND SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO AT THE FAMILY OR FRIEND TO GET PAID AROUND THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR. REALIZING THE EXACT PART TIME CARE. AB THREE SEVEN EIGHT FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE MONN WILL HELP FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THE LICENSES THAT PROVIDERS GET A SEAT AT THE TABLE TO FIGHT FOR BETTER WAGES THAT THEY DESERVE. AND HELPED US AS PARENTS ACT ACCESS WATCH OUT YOUR OPTIONS. REGARD TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE WE HEARD ONE MOTHER. WHO PRAYED THAT THEY WOULD GIVE BIRTH ON A FRIDAY? SO THEY CAN GO BACK TO WORK ON MONDAY. MANY PARENTS DIDN'T TAKE PARENTS LEAVE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO NOT EARN THEIR FULL SALARY. WE KNOW THE BILL THAT WILL EXPAND PAID FAMILY LEAVE INCLUDE INCREASING THE WAGE REPLACEMENT SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY USE THIS PROGRAM. WE ALSO HEARD A LOT FROM PARENTS WERE BEING TREATED POORLY BY CASE WORKERS ACROSS ALL SYSTEMS. IMAGINE WALKING INTO THE CALVERTS OFFICE THE FIRST PHASE THE UC. IS NOT A CASE MANAGER IT'S A SECURITY GUARD. THE GUARD WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY. USE OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I MYSELF BY THE SECURITY GUARD TOWERS OFFICE BEEN TOLD I NEED TO GET A JOB -- I DON'T LIKE WORKING WITH PEOPLE LIKE YOU -- AND SO THESE ARE THE EXPERIENCES THAT WERE HAVING SO MANY OF US SUFFER FOR TOM OPPRESSION DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HEARTS OF JUST BEING POVERTY. SO THOSE ARE JUST GOING THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS ALREADY RE TRAUMATIZING. SO WHEN IT COMES TO AGENCIES SEEKING HELP. OUR MOM IT DESCRIBES RATE OF TAKE PIPER CAL WORKS WITH VISIBLE BRUISES ONE TIRED AND SHE WAS DECLARED TO BE THE METHOD VIOLENCE VICTIM. SHE WAITED THE ENTIRE DAY TO BE HELD TO ONLY TO BE TREATED RUDELY. AT ISSUE WAS A CRIMINAL. TO ADDRESS THIS WE RECOMMEND THAT CASE WORKERS WORK WITH FAMILIES AND TALKING PROVIDERS ARE TRAINED IN OF TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AND RECOGNIZING A PLEASANT PRICE BIAS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT WE START NOT ONLY HIRING MORE BILINGUAL STAFF. BUT ALSO STAFF WHO CAN ACT ACTIVE CULTURAL NAVIGATORS. ONE PAIR DESCRIBED HOW THEY WANT TO APPLY FOR SERVICES AND EVEN THOUGH THEY PROVIDED SOME WAS BOOKED THEIR LANGUAGE. THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO TRANSLATE THE CON. OF WHAT NEEDED TO BE EXPLAINED. SO IF THEY HAD A CASE WORKER WHO WAS? WHO WAS FROM THE SAME COUNTRY THAT THEY WERE IN UNDERSTOOD THE DIFFERENCES? OF BOTH CULTURES IT WOULD HAVE HELPED THEM ACCESS THEIR SERVICES IN A MORE MEANINGFUL LIFE SO NOT JUST INTERPRETATION BUT ALSO CULTURAL NAVIGATION AS WELL -- MYSELF I KNOW THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO TALK TO ANYONE WITH TRAVEL CHILD CARE IN THIS PROCESS. KNOW THAT YOU SPOKE WITH BUT I MYSELF. I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THE CONVERSATIONS WITH TRIBES IN THAT WOULD -- SORRY. SO ALSO AND BEING PART NATIVE AMERICAN WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR CULTURAL NAVIGATORS. WHO COME FROM THE ACTUAL TRIBAL COMMUNITIES FOR THEM TO BASICALLY APPROACH TRAVEL CHILD CARE AND THE WAY THAT WORKS SPECIFICALLY TO THEIR SOVEREIGNTY AND THEIR TRIBAL NATIONS? SO NOT ONLY SUPPORTING JUST NEED AMERICA RATES BUT ALL PARENTS FOR DIFFERENT CULTURES WITH CULTURE APPROPRIATE WAYS. THE LAST NAVIGATION -- LAST WHAT'S UP LIFT IS REGARDING AROUND QUEER FAMILIES ARE FAMILIES DON'T THAT DON'T FIT INTO THE MOTHER FATHER TO PEER FAMILY BOX. ON THIS IS SOMETHING WE DON'T HEAR MUCH ABOUT BUT I MYSELF HAVE FILLED OUT FORMS AROUND CHILDCARE SEEN THE WORDS MOTHER FATHER. SO FOR PARENTS WHO ARE NON BINARY WE'RE TRANCE MIGHT BE A GRANDMA WHO MIGHT BE A FOSTER PARENT. THESE FORMS IN THESE WORDS APPLY TO US. SO. I KNOW THAT -- THERE WAS THE L. G. B. T. JUST CUTE DISPARITIES ACT THAT HAPPENED WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY STATE AGENCIES UPDATE THERE FOR TO BE MORE GENDER NEUTRAL. BUT TO ALSO INCLUDE THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION CHANGES -- SO THAT COULD BE A FORCE RIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT INCLUDED -- AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE REST OF ALL THE STATE AGENCIES CATCH UP SO WE CAN SEE THE ALL TYPES OF PARENTS IN ALL TYPES OF CHILDREN. AND GENDERS OF REPRESENTED AND ALSO DIFFERENT AT THE FAMILIES RIGHT IT'S TWENTY NINETEEN AND I'VE SEEN LOTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF FAMILIES. REPRESENTED. SO -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING WITH MY CHILD [inaudible] HERE'S YOUR GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME IS CARLENE US VIA I LIVE IN HANFORD AND HANFORD CALIFORNIA HERE I HAVE A THREE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND A FIVE YEAR OLD SON. SO THESE SERVICES HAVE ACTUALLY HELPED ME IT'S ABOUT TO BE ALMOST TWO YEARS. SO I'M GONNA -- SPEAK A LITTLE BIT OF OF WHAT I HAD PREPARED FOR YOU GUYS IN THIS WALL SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF MY STORY. SO I COME HERE TODAY ASKING YOU TO PLEASE SUPPORT AB ONE NINETY FOUR I AM ONE OF MANY OF THOUSANDS OF PARENTS WHO HAVE STRUGGLED WITH CHILD CARE TO CONTINUE EMPLOYMENT. OF OUR DREAM CARE SYSTEM WOULD BE FOR THERE TO BE NO WAITING LIST BECAUSE NO PARENT HAS THE LUXURY OF WAITING TO GO BACK TO WORK. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SOME CHILDREN WHO WOULD GET AXES BUT OTHERS IN THE HOUSEHOLD WHAT IT SO THIS WOULD BE IN MY EXPERIENCE -- BECAUSE OF MY MY DAUGHTER MY SON HAVE A TWO YEAR AGE DIFFERENCE SO DEPENDING ON THE AGES THEY HAVE. MORE -- AVAILABILITY SO MY SON WAS ABLE TO GET AFTER -- A FIVE MONTH WAITING WHEN I MOVED HE WAS ABLE TO GET CHILD CARE BUT MY DAUGHTER WHAT IT SO THEN -- THAT JUST ADDS STRUGGLE ON TOP OF NOT BEING ABLE. TO TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CHILDREN ARE GETTING EDUCATION THAT THEY'RE SAFE FOR YOUR OWN WORK -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO PROVIDE FOR THEM WE NEED TO WORK FOR THEM NEED TO FEED THEM. SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS DONE BECAUSE ONE GETS IT THAT'S A GREAT THING YOU KNOW BUT IT'S STILL PUTS THAT PRESSURE ON YOU -- THAT FINANCIAL PRESSURE. SO I KNOW THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE HOW IT IS OF BEING ON EXPERIENCE OF A WAITING LIST AND I KNOW THE STRUGGLE IN THE FINANCIAL STRUGGLE. IT WAS EITHER PAY RENT OR PAY CHILD CARE I KNOW MANY PARENTS WHO CANNOT EVEN AFFORD TO WORK. FOR MONTHS I HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET AND AFTER MY RIGHT IT WAS NEARLY -- THE REST OF MY PAYCHECK SO I REALLY WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS AS WE KNOW YOU HAVE TO WORK TO GET TO WHERE YOU CAN'T JUST. DO SO ONLY EDUCATION AND THEN EXPECT TO HAVE YOUR DREAM JOB YOU HAVE TO WORK YOUR WAY UP ALONG WITH SCHOOL. SO IN ORDER FOR ME TO EVEN SAY OKAY I HAVE A SHOT OF DOING WHAT I WANT TO DO AND PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT. IN THE MEANWHILE I HAVE TO BE WORKING SO FOR ME TO GET THERE I HAVE TO PAY BASICALLY. PACE SO THAT I COULD CONTINUE TO WORK SO I COULD GET SOMEWHERE AND HAVE MY MY LITTLE ONES BEING TAKEN CARE. I LIVED IN AN AREA WHERE THERE WERE ONLY TWO LICENSED FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS SO THOSE WERE ONLY OPTIONS AND THAT'S IF THE WARRANT FOR SO YOU'RE NOT. YOU KNOW SURE THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THEY'RE DONE AND THEN SEE IF YOU GET A SHOT TO GET IN BECAUSE AS WE KNOW THERE'S LONG WAITING LISTS AND I'M. QUITE A BIT OF AN ADVOCATE FOR MYSELF SO I WAS ALWAYS CALLING AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HE HOW WHAT THIS YEAR'S HAVE THIS READY CAN I GO AND AND EVERYBODY WAS ALWAYS HELPFUL AND AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT THAT THEY HELP BUT IT'S JUST. RESOURCES THAT WAS A I KNOW THAT THEY WANTED TO HELP BUT THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THAT THEY COULD DO. SO -- AT ONE POINT IT TOOK LIKE FIVE MONTHS OF YOUR ME TO START MY EMPLOYMENT -- ARE I MEAN TO GET THE CHILD CARE SO WITHIN THAT TIME ALL OF MY INCOME BASICALLY WENT TO THE CHILD CARE I COULDN'T PAY FOR RENT THAT WAS OUT OF THE PICTURE BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF THAT I PAY FOR RENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT I WOULD PAY FOR CHILDCARE. SERVICE EITHER OR SO THEN ONCE I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO GET ON THE PROGRAM I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO MOVE OUT AND YOU KNOW BE AN ADULT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY HAD MONEY LEFT OVER AFTER TWO LITTLE ONES -- SO AFTER THAT I HAD TO DRIVE AN HOUR TO GET TO FOR MY COMMUTE TO GO TO WORK. SO I DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE CLOSER TO MY WORK SO THAT MEANT ANOTHER WAITING LISTS FOR THE DIFFERENT CHILD CARE -- PLACE AND THAT WAS WHERE I HAD THE DIFFICULTY WITH MY SON AND MY DAUGHTER NOT BEING ABLE TO BE SEEN IN THE SAME PLACE. SO IN A DREAMER MORE REALITY. WOULD BE TO HAVE MORE UNINTERRUPTED CARE AS SOON AS WE HAVE TO RETURN TO WORK AND THE WHOLE FAMILY CAN BE SERVE NOT JUST ONE CHILD AND THAT'S VERY STRESSFUL AND VERY COSTLY. I KNOW SO MANY FAMILIES WHO JUST NEED HELP PAYING FOR CHILDCARE AND THEY END UP HAVING TO QUIT. SO IN IN REFERENCE A LITTLE AN ELIGIBILITY WORKER SO IT IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF FAMILIES WHO COME TO MEAND SAY. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE BUT I DO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE I'M THERE YOU KNOW I'M THERE AND AND IT'S A STRUGGLE BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN MEANS YOU DON'T. YOU MAKE TOO MUCH TO GET ASSISTANCE WHEN IT'S STILL YOU'RE STILL IN THAT MIDDLE PART. SO I'M NOT I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO STOP AND THIS IS EVERY DAY IN MY EMPLOYMENT I SEE FAMILIES THAT HAVE TO STOP BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER WAY. FOR THEM TO GET THE ASSISTANCE INSTEAD OF THEY HAVE TO MANDATORY GO THROUGH CAL WORKS THAT'S THEIR ONLY WAY OUT. AND QUITTING WORK TO GET CHILD CARE MAKES NO SENSE. AND SPEAKING OF THE PARENTS AND WORKING -- MY GREAT COMMUNITIES OUT OF THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE TO WORK -- AND HAVE TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN OFTEN TO PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY'RE AT THE HOURS I MEAN A LOT OF THE LABOR HOURS IN AGRICULTURE EARLY MORNING SOMETIME WEEKENDS. AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO ALL OF THAT BECAUSE THE HOURS ARE VERY RESTRICTED -- AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S I MEAN. THE PARENTS CAN'T EVEN FOCUS JUST ON WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE LIKE OKAY HOW WHO'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF MY CHILDREN TOMORROW ARE THEY GOING TO BE SAFE IS IT GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS GOING. TO BENEFIT THEM IN THE LONG RUN ARE THEY GOING TO BE EDUCATED -- SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF MY STORY THE CAN I PLEASE ASK YOU GUYS TO SUPPORT AB ONE NINETY FOUR FOR ALL OF OUR FAMILIES AND ALL OF OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURES.

WE'RE CALLING FOR SIGNIFICANT REFORMS AROUND EQUITY AND TO GENERATION POLICIES. FROM THE START WE'VE EMPHASIZED THE COMPREHENSIVE NATURE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. ADDRESSING ALL OF THE ELEMENTS THAT WE NEED FOR A ROBUST SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM. THAT WORKS BETTER FOR OUR CHILDREN FAMILIES AND THOSE WHO CARE FOR AND EDUCATE THEM. THE COMMISSION'S WORK AS INTENDED TO LAY OUT A LONG TERM VISION FOR THE FUTURE AND TO TRANSCEND YEAR TO YEAR SHORT TERM DISCUSSIONS. IN WHICH SOMEONE AND SOME LIVES. WE KNOW WE WILL ONLY ACHIEVE SYSTEMIC CHANGE IF WE INVEST SIMULTANEOUSLY AND ACCESS COMPENSATION. AND THE SYSTEM ITSELF AND ENSURE INCLUSIVE GOVERNANCE. WITH THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS WE REALLY DO WANT TO MOVE ALL OF THESE PIECES TOGETHER. HIGH QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION THAT IS ACCESSIBLE AND MEETS THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES. AND EFFECTIVE AND PROFESSIONALLY SUPPORTED WORK FORCE. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT CHILDREN FAMILY SUCH AS EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVENTION. AND FINANCING THAT IS STABLE AND SUSTAINABLE IN SUPPORT ALL OF THESE THINGS AT A LEVEL THAT GETS TO THE OUTCOMES THAT ARE YOUNG KIDS NEED AND DESERVE. AS SOON AS A FEW WORDS ABOUT HOW WE GATHERED INFORMATION FOR THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. AS YOU HEARD OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WE HELD HEARINGS ACROSS THE STATE FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO THE BAY AREA AND SACRAMENTO IN LOS ANGELES. WE TOURED A RANGE OF SETTINGS THAT PROVIDE CARE AND EDUCATION FOR KIDS FROM FAMILY CHILDCARE HOMES TO NONPROFIT PROVIDERS TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. WE'VE. COLLABORATED WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND SURVEYED MORE THAN THIRTY ORGANIZATIONS. COMMISSION MEMBERS ALSO PARTICIPATED IN OTHER PLANNING AND ANALYSIS EFFORTS AND WE CAREFULLY REVIEW THEIR FINDINGS. WE HAVE PRESENTED OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. OTHER KEY LEGISLATORS. AND THE SPEAKER -- GIVEN THE REPORT. AND WE HAVE DRAWN UPON CURRENT AND PAST PROPOSALS MODELS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN OTHER STATES. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND NINE KEY TOPIC AREAS WHICH WILL BE COVERED BY MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS WERE INFORMED BY SUB COMMITTEES WHICH HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. ALL AND BY RECOGNIZING WHAT I KNOW WE ALL FEEL THAT THIS IS SUCH AN EXCITING MOMENT FOR CALIFORNIA. MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR LONGER THAN I HAVE BUT IN THE TWELVE YEARS OR SO SINCE I'VE BEEN AN ADVOCATE THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MAJOR CHANGES. WE SEE THIS AS AN IMPORTANT REPORT AND WE ALSO WANT TO SEE THE WORK CONTINUE BEYOND THIS DOCUMENT. SO YOU'LL SEE PROPOSALS FOR MORE POWERFUL AND INCLUSIVE COUNCILS THAT WILL LEAD TO STRONG VOICES PUSHING FOR CHANGE INCLUDING LEGISLATORS. FAMILIES THE WORK FORCE AND MANY OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. I'M SO EXCITED TO HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU. AND FIRST ALTERNATE OVER TO MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS TO PRESENT RECOMMENDATIONS IN EACH OF THE NINE AREAS. A GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY -- I AM VERY PLACES THE STATE ORGANIZER PREPARE VOICES OF BEEN A COMMUNITY COMMISSIONER AND I'M GOING TO DISCUSS -- SOME BRIEFLY ABOUT OUR FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND OUR ACCESS -- RECOMMENDATIONS -- AS YOU SON WITNESSED -- AND WITH OUR REPORT -- WAS COMMITTED TO FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AT EVERY LEVEL WEATHER WAS PUTTING MYSELF ON THIS COMMISSION OR CREATING THE PROCESS TO ENABLE FAMILIES TO BE. THE EXPERTS AND REALLY BE SEEN AS THE EXPERTS AND THIS COMMISSION AND AND THE REPORT REALLY REFLECTS THAT. ENGAGEMENT IS TWO WAYS IT'S NOT JUST FROM THE PRACTITIONER TO THE FAMILY BUT IT'S ALSO. FROM THE FAMILY BACK TO US -- I THINK WE REALLY REFLECTED THAT WHEN YOU. SEE PARENTS WHEN YOU LISTEN TO PARENTS -- WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING AND THEN TURN IT INTO ACTION -- THAT'S GOING TO BE THE BEST RECIPE FOR REALLY IMPROVING OUR SYSTEMS AND WHILE THIS THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE PARENTS ARE SORT OF AN ADDENDUM TO THE REPORT. YOU'LL ALSO SEE THAT THERE THEY ARE ALL INTEGRATED THROUGHOUT ALL OF THE THEMES IN THE REPORT AND I THINK THIS COMMISSION CAN REALLY -- BE SEEN AS A MODEL FOR HOW TO DO FAMILY ENGAGEMENT RIGHT I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE IT FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART -- ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS ALSO TO CREATE -- AND ESTABLISH A PARENT ADVISORY COUNCIL -- NOT FOR LIP SERVICE -- NOT TO AND YOU KNOW OF LIKE REAL TEETH AND MAKE SURE THAT ANY PROPOSAL THAT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. ARE VETTED FIRST THROUGH THOSE FAMILIES SO THAT YOU ACTUALLY CAN ADDRESS OBSTACLES AND BARRIERS ON THE FRONT AND INSTEAD OF ON THE BACK AND WHEN IT'S AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE -- I THINK THAT WHAT MONEY DESCRIBED -- IN HER RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE -- FAMILY ENGAGEMENT REALLY HAS. TO START AT WILL REALLY LEAD TO CULTURE SHIFTS IN HOW WE TREAT -- FAMILIES WHO ARE COMING TO SUPPORT SHE DESCRIBED THE SECURITY GUARDS -- WE HEARD FROM SO MANY FAMILIES JUST THIS YOU KNOW -- ENVIRONMENT OF FRAUD DETECTION AND AND CRIMINALIZATION AND WE NEED TO REMOVE THAT SO THAT WE CAN ALL WORK IN AS PARTNERS. IN ACHIEVING THE OUTCOMES THAT WE NEED -- IN REGARDS TO THE ACCESS RECOMMENDATIONS -- WE WERE ABLE TO BRING IN THE HAAS INSTITUTE FROM UC BERKELEY -- STEVEN -- MEN INDIAN CAME AND SPOKE TO THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION HEARING AND INTRODUCED US TO A TOPIC CALLED TARGETED UNIVERSALISM. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ACCESS SOMETIMES UNIVERSAL ACCESS RIGHT -- AND THAT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO HAVE UNIVERSAL ACCESS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES -- BUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT UNIVERSAL ACCESS IS THAT THAT CAN OFTEN MEAN THAT THOSE WHO HAVE THE LEAST BARRIERS AND OBSTACLES ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE PROGRAMS FIRST. AND SO -- WHAT WHAT HE TALKED TO US ABOUT WAS TARGETED UNIVERSALISM AND THAT'S HOW WE LAID OUT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND ACCESS SO YOU'LL SEE THAT WHILE THE UNIVERSAL GOAL -- WOULD BE THAT NO PARENT -- PAYS MORE THAN 7% OF THEIR INCOME TOWARDS THE COST OF CARE -- IN BETWEEN WE HAVE SHORT TERM MID TERM -- GOALS -- ONE WOULD BE. SERVING FAMILIES WHO MAKE UNDER POVERTY MEASURE WHICH DEFINITELY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA -- THE NEXT GOAL WOULD BE TO SERVE FAMILIES -- BELOW 70% OF THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME -- AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE AN IDEA AROUND -- ESTABLISHING A ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM EMERGENCY SERVICES FUND AND THIS IS A RECOGNITION THAT. ON OUR WAITING LIST AND ARE. ARE COOKED AND WHICH IS NOT A THANKS KRISTIN SCHUMACHER FROM THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER. YOU KNOW SHE'S TOLD US THAT WE HAD TWO MILLION ELIGIBLE CHILDREN -- ON WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CHILD CARE SERVICES 86% OF THEM ARE CHILDREN OF COLOR -- AND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THEM ARE WAITING FOR CHILDCARE BUT OUR EXPERIENCE SEEN CRISIS RIGHT NOW THESE ARE HOMELESS FAMILIES THESE ARE -- FAMILIES IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM -- IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM FAMILIES TOWARD ARE DEALING WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND BY WAITING FOR CHILD CARE WERE ONLY EXACERBATING THAT TRAUMA. AND SO BY PULLING OFF THOSE FAMILIES AND HAVING AN EMERGENCY FUND WE ALSO ARE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT EATING FAMILIES IN CRISIS AGAINST THE WORKING POOR FAMILIES WHO ARE ONE CRISIS AWAY FROM FROM JOINING THEM SO THAT WE CAN REALLY. TRY TO SERVE BOTH FAMILIES. SO AGAIN MORE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE FULL REPORT BUT WE JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF HIGHLIGHTS SO THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE. AND IT'S BEEN A A GREAT JOURNEY BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET WE JUST GETTING ON THE BUS. SO IN TERMS OF OUR WORK FORCE -- IT'S LIKE THE PARENTS THAT WERE HERE BEFORE WITHOUT THE CHILDREN. WE WOULD HAVE NO JOBS AND WITHOUT. THE WORK FORCE WE CAN TALK ABOUT A QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REALLY FOCUSED AND THE WORK THAT WE LOOKED AT IN TERMS OF STARTING WITH THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE REPORT. OF TRANSFORMING THE WORK. FOUR ZERO TWO EIGHT WE LOOKED AT A LOT OF THE THE CENTER OF STUDY FOR CHILDREN -- FOR CHILDCARE I TO BERKELEY WE LOOKED AT REPORT FROM A ARE WE LOOKED AT RAND REPORT. WE LOOKED AT THE WORK THAT QUALITY COUNTS IS DOING IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE WORKFORCE. AND ALL IN ALL WE NEEDED TO START IN TERMS OF IF WE DO NOT IMPROVE. THE RATE OF REIMBURSEMENT AND HOW MUCH WE PAY OUR BRAIN DEVELOPERS WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET FROM HERE TO THERE. SO THAT'S WE WE REALLY STARTED IN TERMS OF WITHOUT INCREASING THE DOLLARS THAT ARE INVESTED. IN THE PROGRAMS IN THE PARTICULAR IN THE COMPENSATION. OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THIS AMAZING WORK WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET VERY FAR. WE NEED TO CONSIDER MORE WORK FORCES ARE KERN WORK FORCES UNDERPAID OVERWORKED AND IN MANY CASES NOT SUPPORTED. BY ANY SYSTEM. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A MAKES DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT IN SOME CASES WE DO HAVE THE SUPPORT MECHANISMS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T TO BE PART. OF A BIG SYSTEM THEY'RE IN A CENTER BASED PROGRAM WHEN THEY'RE PART OF A NONPROFIT. BUT WITHIN A SYSTEM THAT'S IN THE CENTER AND DO HAVE RESOURCES. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS WHO ARE CARING. FOR A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR CHILDREN. WHAT ABOUT THE FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THAT MIGHT BE PART OF A FAMILY CHILD CARE NETWORK BUT MIGHT NOT HAVE? AS MANY SUPPORT IN ONE AREA VERSUS ANOTHER VERSUS COACHELLA AS OPPOSED TO FRESNO AS OPPOSED TO LA AS OPPOSED TO LAKE COUNTY AT CETERA. WHAT ABOUT THE WORK FORCE THAT IS ALL OVER OUR GREAT STATE? THE DEAL WITH. CHILDREN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE WHO HAVE -- NEEDS IN TERMS OF SPECIAL NEEDS WHAT ABOUT BEHAVIORAL ISSUES WHAT ABOUT SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNING ISSUES. SO OUR WORK FORCE IS NOT ONLY DIVERSE IN TERMS OF WHO WE ARE. BUT THE CHILDREN THAT WE'RE SERVING AND THE VAST NEEDS THAT ARE THERE. WITHIN -- OUR EXISTING SYSTEM WE NEED TO VALUE WHAT WE DO HAVE. WHAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE IS HOW IMPORTANT THE EXISTING WORK FORCE? THAT WE HAVE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE TELL THEM HOW IMPORTANT WHAT A GREAT JOB THEY'VE DONE. BUT THAT THEY MAY NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. CARE THEMSELVES AND COMPENSATION THAT WE BELIEVE IS DUE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORK FORCE THAT IS THERE IS SUPPORTING THE NEEDS OF THE FAMILIES WHETHER IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE PARENTS ARE WORKING. WHETHER IT'S IN THE DESERT IN A IN A IN A RURAL AREA OR IN AN URBAN AREA. WE NEED TO CONSIDER THAT OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. IS AN ASSET WHICH WE NEED TO BUILD UP. WE HAVE A MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A PRIVATE PUBLIC. CENTER BASED HOME BASED AND THAT IT NEEDS TO BE REALLY MADE MORE ABUNDANT. WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE CAREER PATHWAYS FOR OUR EXISTING WORK FORCE AND TO ATTRACT. A LOT MORE PEOPLE INTO THE WORK FORCE AND THE FIRST PLACES TO BEGIN WITH THAT COMPENSATION. BUT ALSO WITH IT I'M GOING TO THE TERMS OF WHETHER IT'S THE PRE SERVICE ENTITIES WHETHER WE CHOOSE TO GO TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHETHER IT'S A RESOURCE AND REFERRAL THAT SUPPORTS US BECAUSE WERE ALREADY SERVING THOSE FAMILIES. WHETHER IT'S A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WHETHER IT'S THE FIRST FIVE IN A LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHETHER IT'S A NONPROFIT. THAT IS OUT THERE ARE ALREADY DOING THIS FOR US AND OR A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY BECAUSE SOME OF OUR WORKFORCE I INDIVIDUALS CHOOSE TO NOT ONLY GET AN EIGHT EIGHT AND A B.. EIGHT AND WHAT EVER CHOICES BUT IT NEEDS TO BE WHERE THEY NEED AND THE CHOICES THAT INDIVIDUAL CAN COME ABOUT. AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE GIVE ONGOING SUPPORT NO MATTER WHETHER. OUR FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS HAVE THEIR EIGHT AND MANY DO. SOME OF THEM HAVE THEIR BE EIGHT AND MANY DO BUT IF THEY DON'T WHAT DO WE DO IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN OUR REGIONS AND IN OUR STATE TO INSURE. THAT WE MAINTAIN AND SUSTAIN A HIGH CALL QUALITY WORK FORCE FOR INFANTS. TODDLERS ARE PRESCHOOLS AND BEYOND BECAUSE MANY OF OUR CHILDREN DO NEED THAT I'M GOING. CARE PART UNTIL THEY'RE TWELVE YEARS OLD AND SO I KNOW THAT MANY OF THE AUDIENCE THAT OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS ARE. ARE ALWAYS ADVOCATING FOR FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. SO THE REPORT HAS A LOT MORE. AND NOW THEY IN A FINANCED IT SO WILL TRANSFER OVER. TO TANYA DID YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING. YEAH SO AND JUST ONE MORE THING -- THAT SOON I HAD TALKED ABOUT THIS MORNING AND IT WAS THE FACT THAT THERE'S SO MANY ENTITIES OUT THERE. THAT ARE AVAILABLE BUT WE NEVER COME TOGETHER. AND BECAUSE OF THAT THIS WHOLE CHILD CARE SYSTEM IS IS. IS DISJOINTED. AND SO UNTIL WE RECOGNIZED AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO COLLABORATE AND COME TOGETHER AT THE TABLE -- WE'LL STAY DISJOINTED AND WHICH MEANS THE WORK FORCE WILL NOT HAVE ROOM TO GROW. AND ALL THE THINGS THAT SHE JUST LAID OUT THAT WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED WE FELT LIKE THAT WILL THAT WILL HAPPEN AND THAT WILL TAKE PLACE. AND WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE A MODEL OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. WHEN GROUPS FROM EVERY ORGANIZATION COMES TOGETHER AND CAN COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS AND SO -- JUST ADDING THAT LIKE I SAID WHERE THE OUR FIRST FIVE OR YOUR UNION -- WE ALL NEED TO LEARN HOW TO COME IN AND WORK TOGETHER AND THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE WORK FORCE EVEN STRONGER [inaudible] THE COMMISSION. PUSH THE BLAME IS COMMISSIONER MAHDI -- CARING FOR CHILDREN I THINK WE ALL NOT THINK I ABSOLUTELY NO THAT WE ALL CARE. FOR TELL TO EDUCATE CHILDREN AND WE ALL BELIEVE THAT EDUCATING AND CARING FOR STUDENTS AND CHILDREN DO NOT. IT DOESN'T START ONCE YOU ENTER KINDERGARTEN. IT STARTS THE MINUTE A CHILD IS BORN. CHILDREN WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE BEFORE THEY ENTER KINDERGARTEN. ARE AT A TREMENDOUS DISADVANTAGE AND WILL HAVE TO WORK MANY TIMES HARDER TO CATCH UP. IMPROVING IN INCREASING SERVICES AND PROGRAMS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ARE A MUST. AND THE SERVICES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE MUST BE EASIER TO ACCESS. SYSTEMS MUST BE SIMPLIFIED AND THE ALIGNMENT IN COORDINATION BETWEEN VARIOUS AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS CARING FOR CHILDREN MUST IMPROVE IF WE ARE TO CLOSE THE OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS GAP SO PREVALENT ACROSS OUR NEW SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONWIDE. SO THIS ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSIONS HEARING -- RECOMMENDATIONS AIM TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE FOLLOWING AREAS. BARRIERS TO DISTRICT PARTICIPATION IN PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE PROGRAMS NEED TO BE MEDICATED. INCLUDING COORDINATION AND GREATER ALIGNMENT OF SCHEDULES FACILITY REGULATIONS AN APPROPRIATE LENGTH OF DAYS AND YEAR TO MEET THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES. TARGETED SUPPORT PROGRAMS SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO CHILDREN WHO FACE SPECIAL CHALLENGES. IN ORDER TO ENSURE EARLY ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION. PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICT PROGRAMS AND ARE MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEMS MUST BE STRENGTHENED. STAFF QUALIFICATIONS RATIOS AND DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE PRACTICES. FOR CHILDREN BIRTH TO AGE FIVE SHOULD BE ANALYZED AND WHERE NECESSARY CHANGE TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN THRIVE. WE MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF STRONG EXPERTISE ALREADY IN EXISTENCE THROUGH FIRST FIVE AND HEAD START IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A MORE SEAMLESS SERVICE. THAT ADDRESSES SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL IT NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THROUGH WRAPAROUND SERVICES. WE MUST ENSURE THAT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN TRIBAL AREAS HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE. THAT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SYSTEMS AND REQUIREMENTS OF ALL COLORS ARE CULTURALLY RELEVANT. AND RESPONSIVE AND REFLECT THE NEEDS OF TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. AND ASSESSMENTS SHOULD BE BUILT ON THEIR CURRENT STRENGTH. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PRE PRESCHOOL HEAD START AND OTHER PROGRAMS SHOULD BE EXAMINED TO INCREASE ACCESS. AND THERE IS TREMENDOUS NEED TO COLLABORATE WITH BUSINESS AND ENCOURAGE PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES. I TO SUPPORT FAMILIES AND DEVELOP FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACES. REGIONAL EFFORTS NEED TO INCLUDE LOCAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY EQUITY GAPS SUPPORT LOCAL INNOVATION. COORDINATE LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS AND EVALUATE LOCAL EFFORTS. LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE MUST COORDINATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTEGRATED BIRTH TO FIVE SYSTEM STATEWIDE. THAT ADDRESSES THE MULTIPLE NEEDS OF FAMILIES USING CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE MODELS. WORKING IN SILOS HAS NOT AND WILL NOT WORK. WE MUST REACH ACROSS SYSTEMS AND OVERCOME TRADITIONAL DIVISIONS. AND AREAS TO BETTER SERVE OUR CHILDREN. IT TAKES ALL OF US AND OUR COORDINATED AND ALIGNED EFFORTS TO REACH OUR GOAL OF MAKING SURE ALL CHILDREN. HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE FROM BIRTH AND ALL THE WAY UP TO COLLEGE AND BEYOND. IT TAKES COLLECTIVE WILL. TO COLLABORATE IN ORDER TO CHANGE THINGS AND CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. EXPECT US TO HAVE THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT BY THEM. AND MY HOPE IS THAT WHEN WE ARE DONE. IT DOES THIS. DOES NOT SAY WAITING TO BE SEEN. AND DEMAND TO BE HEARD THAT YOU ARE SEEING AND YOU ARE HER. OKAY SO THERE ARE THREE SECTIONS LEFT TO GO. AND BETWEEN DOCTOR ACROSS CAN I WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS. THOSE THREE SECTIONS SO I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT. SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPLYING AND FACILITIES I'M GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT GOVERNANCE AND ADMINISTRATION FINANCING. AND THEN DOCTOR MCCROSKEY IS GOING TO BRING IT ON HOME TALKING ABOUT INTEGRATED DATA TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE THOUGHT THAT. IT MADE SENSE TO END. ON OKAY SO. I SOME OF WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY IS PROBABLY A REPEAT OF WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD. BUT I WANT TO SAY THAT SINCE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR FORTY TWO YEARS. WHICH MAKES ME ONE OF THE SENIOR CITIZEN ASSEMBLY REALLY CHILDHOOD FIELD -- HI. I'M GONNA GO REPEAT THESE THINGS BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN A OF A LONG TIME COMING MY MOTHER WOULD BE SO PROUD. SO. ARE IN THE SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPLY AND FACILITIES -- WE START BY TALKING ABOUT THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE DO WE HAVE TO APPLY EQUITY LENDS TO IT. THAT MEANS THAT THE PLANNING THE EVALUATION IN EVERY ASPECT OF PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. WE HAVE TO AND YOU'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE CULTURE FROM ONE OF COMPLIANCE TO ONE OF FAMILY AND CHILD SUPPORT. THIS IS LIKE NO SMALL FEAT THIS IS REALLY A MAJOR PIECE BECAUSE FOR THE LAST -- I DON'T KNOW TWO DOZEN YEARS WE'VE BEEN REALLY LOOKED AT ABOUT. COMPLIANCE AND LOOKED AT ABOUT FRAUD AND NOW WE REALLY NEED TO TALK ABOUT SUPPORTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED TO CREATE INTER AGENCY COMMUNICATIONS AND EARLY CHILDHOOD ADVISORY COUNCIL THAT MAKES UP ALL THE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ADVICE ON EARLY CHILDHOOD -- WE NEED TO ELEVATE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S RESPONSIBILITY -- YOU HEARD ABOUT PARENTS AND ALSO WORKFORCE COUNCILS TO FEED INTO THIS EARLY CHILDHOOD ADVISORY COUNCIL. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE REALISTIC FEES THAT PARENTS CAN PAY. ARE YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND WE NEED TO REMOVE THE UNNECESSARY COMPLEX CONTRACTS AND CONTRACTING. PROCESS IS THAT US AGENCIES ADMINISTER AS WELL AS PARENTS HAVE TO DEAL WITH ON A REGULAR BASIS. WE HAVE TO REVIEW LICENSING STAY. THOSE WITH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. WERE RECOMMENDING -- WE CONVENE A DISASTER RECOVERY TASK FORCE THAT WOULD BUILD ON THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN PLAN BECAUSE RIGHT NOW PROVIDERS DON'T HAVE. DISASTER RECOVERY PLANS AND REALLY NEED ONE ESPECIALLY IN THIS LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WERE THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISASTER EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS. WHERE -- RECOMMENDING THAT WE ADOPT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE REFORM WORKING GROUP'S RECOMMENDATIONS. AND IN ADDITION RATE SHOULD ALLOW FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND FOR BENEFITS PACKAGES -- WE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW FACILITIES BASED ON EMERGING NEEDS INCLUDING LICENSED FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES. AND WE SHOULD INCLUDE HEAD START AND STATE PLANNING TO GET TO FULL DAY FULL YEAR THROUGH OUR HEAD START PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THROUGH OTHER PROGRAMS. AND TRANSFER FUNDS FROM THE CURRENT REVOLVING LOAN FUND TO THE NEWS FACILITIES PROGRAM THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING. THAT WOULD BE A GRANT PROGRAM AND NOT A A BORROWING FROM. IN TERMS OF GOVERNANCE AND ADMINISTRATION. WE STRONGLY FEEL THAT WE HAVE TO BUILD ON A MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN NATURE OF CHILD CARE. AND EARLY CHILDHOOD AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES FOR GOVERNANCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THEN IN TERMS OF FINANCING. THERE SHOULD BE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SETTINGS THAT MEET FAMILY NEEDS AND OUR HIGH QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE. THAT'S TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE WELL COMPENSATED A PROFESSIONALLY SUPPORTED DIVERSE WORK FORCE. IN SUPPORT FOR NECESSARY FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING THAT THERE BE ANY A REDUCTION OF CURRENT FUNDING FOR OTHER PROGRAMS. THIS IS ONE OF THE PROMISES THAT WE MADE DEPARTMENT LIKE DAY. ONE NINETY EIGHT IN THAT WE FEEL THE CHILD CARE WORKERS AND PROVIDER SHOULD NOT FINANCE THROUGH THEIR LOW WAGES AND THEIR LACK OF BENEFITS THE FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD BE COMPENSATED THE WAY THAT EVERYBODY ELSE'S COMPENSATE. WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING THAT IN ORDER TO GET TO A 100% OF FUNDING FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE WE'LL LIMóN AT THE CAP ON TAXABLE WAGES OF A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND AND SIXTY SEVEN SO THAT. EVERYBODY PAYS TOWARDS MAKING SURE THAT THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN HAVE THEIR PARENTS. FOR THOSE IN CRITICAL BONDING TIMES THEN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAXIMIZING FEDERAL DRAWDOWNS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ENSURING THAT ALL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT MONEY GOES TO SERVE THOSE CHILDREN WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL. IN SO. THERE'S A LOT MORE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST PULL OUT THOSE IS IS BEING SOME THAT THAT I THOUGHT TO BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL. AND THEN OVERVIEW FOR CLEAN UP THEIR ACT. THANK YOU. FOR A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGE TRYING TO SAY ALL OF THIS IN A SHORT TIME AND YOU CAN HELP BUT WE REALLY WANT TO GET TO YOU -- SO IN TERMS OF THE DATA THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF DATA. IS [inaudible] NOT EVEN BEGINNING TO BE ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT THIS COMPLICATED SYSTEM IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T COLLECT A LOT OF DATA WE COLLECT A LOT OF DATA AS ANYBODY WHO'S A PROVIDER KNOWS AND IS ANYBODY WHO'S A PARENT KNOWS. THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF FORM FILLING OUT AND FORM RE COMPLETION AND RE AND CETERA IT'S NOT ALL DATA THAT'S ACTUALLY USED. FOR ON GOING IMPROVEMENT OF THE SYSTEM IT'S BEEN AS AS THAT NUMBER VESTED SAID SEVERAL TIMES COMPLIANCE ORIENTED NOT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ORIENTED. AND WE ALL NEED TO BAND TOGETHER. DATA CAN BE REALLY IT HELPFUL THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED DIRECTLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FROM PROGRAMS BUT ALSO COORDINATING THAT DATA WITH OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE COLLECTING DATA SO WHERE. FOR JUST FOR EXAMPLE PROJECTING OUR CHILD POPULATION SO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE PLANNING FOR INTO THE FUTURE THERE ARE A LOT OF PIECES OF DATA THAT WE JUST HAVEN'T COORDINATED HERE -- THE THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. TRANSPARENT TO THOSE OF US WHO WORK IN IT BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TRANSPARENT TO PARENTS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE LOOKING FOR CARE AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN THEIR AREA. AND TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC THIS IS. I WORK A LOT OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES SYSTEMS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST COMPLICATED. TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND -- THE INTEGRATION OF DATA IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE FAMILIES NEED A LOT OF HELP AND SUPPORT ALONG THE WAY AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME SO MAKING SURE WE COULD SHARE DATA. THAT REALLY SUPPORTS THOSE NEEDS SO WHERE FINANCING THEM APPROPRIATELY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. CAN AND THE LAST THING I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ALL THE WE REFERRED TO IT IS THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S SUCH A COMPLICATED SYSTEM. IS THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD A CORD LEVEL AND SO ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS HAS TO DO WITH -- THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EARLY CHILDHOOD POLICY COUNCIL THAT WOULD PULL TOGETHER THE PLAYERS FOR MULTIPLE PARTS OF THIS SYSTEM TO ADVISE THE GOVERNOR OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC -- SO WE CAN HAVE AT LEAST ONE PLACE WHICH IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT OVERSIGHT WHICH IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN WHICH IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT. HOW DO WE MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE -- THERE ARE TWO KEY SETS OF PLAYERS HIS VOICE IS HAVE TO BE FRONT AND CENTER ON THEM. THE PARENTS THROUGH A PARENT ADVISORY COUNCIL AND THE WORK FORCE TO A WORKFORCE BUT AS YOU CANCEL AND RATHER THAN SAYING LET'S POINT ONE PARENT OR TWO PARENTS LET'S POINT ONE PROVIDER TO PROVIDERS. WE REALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EACH GROUP HAVE ITS OWN COUNCIL. WITH SUPPORT AND WITH THREE SOURCES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING SO THAT THEY THEY GET THE CHANCE TO WORK THROUGH IDEAS AND AND BRING THEM FORWARD TO THIS. OVERALL POLICY COUNCIL THE THE LEADERSHIP OBVIOUSLY TO FROM THE LEGISLATURE FROM THE GOVERNOR FROM KEY ORGANIZATIONS -- FIRST FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MAKES DELIVERY SYSTEM ALL OF THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT ADMINISTRATION IS ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. TO AND SO WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING THAT WE ESTABLISH AN OFFICE FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WHICH INCLUDES A REALLY STRONG INTER AGENCY WORK GROUP. THAT THE ABILITY OF STATE DEPARTMENTS TO WORK TOGETHER IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT SO IS THE ABILITY OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S TO WORK WITH OUTSIDE EXTERNAL ENTITIES. WHO CAN PROVIDE RESOURCES THE STAFF AND WE WON'T GET IT DONE -- AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS WORKED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL LITTLE TINY LOCALITY NAMED LOS ANGELES KILLING FOR A LAST TWENTY YEARS ON THIS WE'RE TRYING REALLY HARD AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND THEY KNOW PEOPLE ARE AND OTHER REGIONS AND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT WITHOUT CLARITY FROM THE STATE LEVEL IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET IT DONE AND SO LIKE ALL THE OTHER COMMISSIONERS WE ARE JUST INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL TO THE ASSEMBLY -- FOR LOOK FOR LETTING US PLAINTIFF OKAY TODAY. ALSO FOR LETTING US LEARN AND WORK WITH YOU OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND IT COULD NOT BE MORE EXCITED ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY. OKAY THANK YOU WHAT WE KNOW. THIS IS YOUR LIFE'S WORK SO THANKS. FOR ALLOWING US TO BE PART OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE ALL OF THE EXPERTISE AND TIME. YOU HIGHLY COMPENSATED COMMISSIONERS PUT INTO. INTO EVER -- BEFORE WE GET TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION -- ANY COMMISSIONS AT SOME COMMENTS COMMISSIONER IGNATIUS. I'M SORRY JUST REALLY QUICKLY -- I JUST WANT TO REITERATE JUST HOW IMPORTANT THE FINANCING PIECES AND AND THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD THAT WE WE NEED REVENUES WE NEED MORE THAN ONE TIME FUNDING SOLUTIONS THAT. THIS IS REALLY GOING TO REQUIRE ROBUST -- CONVERSATION AROUND THAT AND THE REASON OUR POINT THAT OUT IS BECAUSE SOMETHING OR MCCARTY YOU JUST GAVE US A REALLY LIKE HIGH NOTE ABOUT THE YOU KNOW SOME GOOD NEWS OUT OF WASHINGTON DC. BUT THAT ONE BILLION COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF MAKING CUTS TO MEDICARE AL AND HOUSING AND FOOD ASSISTANCE AND THAT'S WHAT WE WE HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM. YOU KNOW TAKING FUNDING FROM ONE PROGRAM THE FAMILIES REALLY NEED TO TO PROVIDE FOR SOMETHING ELSE FAMILIES REALLY NEEDS OF REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF AN OPTION SO I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT. COLLEGES FOR SORRY THE GOOD THAT'S OKAY WELL CONGRESS SAID THAT BUDGETS DEAD ON ARRIVAL SO WE'LL TAKE THE TAKE THE GOOD NEWS IS. IN THE BUDGET AND AND RE APPROPRIATE THE OTHER STUFF. YES -- COMMISSION OWNIK I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE RECOGNIZE NANCY STROLL KILL GROUND AND STACY RIORDAN. FOR KEEPING US ALL TOGETHER AND MAKING SURE THAT ALL THE GREAT IDEAS THAT WE THREW OUT THERE GOT PUT TO PAPER AND ALSO. HE NOW SEES A CHRISTIAN SCHUMACHER DID -- WE WOULD NOT BE WHERE WE ARE WITHOUT WITHOUT THOSE FOUR MINUTES. YES WELL SAID. AND EVERYBODY THAT PARTICIPATED ON THE PANELS THROUGHOUT THIS SEVEN HEARINGS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THEY WERE ALL LOOKS VERY WELL PREPARED -- HELPED US UNDERSTAND. NO THE ISSUES FROM THE FROM THE FORTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL -- JUST FROM YOU KNOW I REMEMBER PARENTS COMING UP AT SOME OF THOSE HEARINGS JUST SHARING THEIR PERSPECTIVES WHICH ENABLE US TO REALLY UNDERSTAND SOME OF THEM. PROGRAMS AND THE LACK OF SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES AND KIDS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- SO SO WITH THAT WE WANT TO BEGIN WITH THAT PUBLIC COMMENT TO ME BECAUSE START MAKING WITH THIS SIDE AND AS YOU START COMING UP. WE DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT THE END -- WE DO ENCOURAGE THAT PUBLIC TO SUBMIT COMMENTS -- IN WRITING. YOU EMAIL THEM TO THAT'S TO US AND WE WILL INCORPORATE THOSE IN OUR FINAL REPORT AND THE FINAL REPORT WILL DO JUST WHAT YOU SAID. COMMISSIONER NIECES AS LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF OF OF THESE. IDEAS -- PUT IN PLACE A COST ESTIMATES BECAUSE I KNOW THIS PILOT PEOPLE OUT THERE SAYING WELL THIS IS FABULOUS AMAZING WHAT IS THIS COSTS AND SO WE'RE NOT QUITE TO THAT POINT YET. AND WE DO HAVE SOME IDEAS AS FAR AS HOW WE GET FINANCE THIS IN CALIFORNIA -- AS WELL. SO I'M GONNA WE'RE GONNA ASK EACH -- EACH PARTICIPANT TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO ROUGHLY A MINUTE. IF YOU CUT. THANK YOU MY NAME IS. THANK YOU MY NAME IS TONY ISAAC SOMEONE I THINK THIS SOMEONE MEMBERS AND THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSIONERS I AM FROM PEACH WERE EARLY CHILDHOOD HIGHER EDUCATION COLLABORATIVE ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT -- EARLY CHILDHOOD AND EARLY YOU SEE FACULTY FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE CS USE UC'S AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AND WE WANNA -- THANK THE COMMISSIONERS PHAM DEEPLY FOR THIS HOLISTIC APPROACH -- AND LISTENING TO THE STAKEHOLDERS AS YOU CREATED THE PRINCIPLES AND DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS TO REALLY MAKE SURE YOU'RE MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES AND AS WELL AS TO ADDRESS. THE NEEDS OF THE EARLY CHILDHOOD WORK FOR SAY THAT WE RECOGNIZE IT IN THE WORK FORCE OF QUALITY SECTION THE IMPORTANCE THAT COMPETENCY BASED ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE CREATED FOR ALL POSITIONS. INCLUDING TEACHERS COACHES ADMINISTRATORS. AND CENTER DIRECTORS WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU -- VALUE THE INVESTMENT IN PROVIDING OUR RESOURCES FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND REALLY TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE'RE SUPPORTING OUR DIVERSE WORKFORCE. AND INCLUDING SUPPORT FOR TUITION BOOKS FEES AS WELL AS THE IMPORTANCE FOR PROFESSIONAL GROWTH ADVISORS AND EASY SPECIFIC OUR COLLEGE CAREER COUNSELORS. AND FINALLY WE JUST WANT TO URGE THAT WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE EARLY CHILDHOOD POLICY COUNCIL THAT -- HIGHER EDUCATION IS AT THE TABLE THANK YOU SO MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING I AM DOT TO MARTINE JAY GUMM ALSO REPRESENTATIVE OF PEACH. AND SERVE AS A PRESS MEDICATION AT PEPPERDINE UNIVERSITY GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION. AND PSYCHOLOGY MY DOCTOR IS IN DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNING AND I CHILDHOOD POLICY PEOPLE AND PROCESSES. AND WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE AT PEACH YOUR SUPPORT FOR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AS NOTED IN THE REPORT. WE AT PEACH THANK THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO EQUITY IN EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN FAMILIES AND EQUITY IN EASY WORKFORCE COMPETENCY BASED. PREPARATION IN SERVICE TRAINING ASSESSMENT AND COMMENSURATE CON COMPENSATION. I REFERS SPECIFICALLY TO THE REC MEN EDUCATION SYSTEMS. DEEPLY GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES SPECIAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS AND WE ALSO RECOMMEND SUPPORT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND MODIFICATION. OF ECP SPECIFIC HIGHER EDUCATION GRADUATE PROGRAMS TO ALIGN WITH DECISION. TO INCREASE OUR STATE'S CAPACITY TO PREPARE EAZY E. SPECIFIC HIGHER EDUCATION FACULTY AT MOST OF AND DOCTORAL LEVELS. GRADUATES WHO WILL SERVE AS EASY E. FACULTY INTO YEAR FAURIA AND BEYOND HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING PATTY FOR IN YOUR FOR FROM THE CHILD CARE LAWCENTER. I WANT TO JUST THANK ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE LEGISLATORS THE STAFF -- WHO DID SO MUCH WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE? APPROPRIATELY GROUNDED IN THE EXPERIENCE THAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE WIDER CHILD CARE COMMUNITY AND IS FOCUSED ON WHAT PERRANCE -- AS EXPERTS AND THE PROVIDERS WHO PROVIDE THE CARE TO OUR CHILDREN BRING TO THIS CONVERSATION AND THAT REALITY BASED -- INFORMATION AND INPUT IS WHAT MAKES YOUR RECOMMENDATION SO STRONG. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT -- THIS REPORT IS TOO IMPORTANT TO GET SHELVED IN A IN A DESK SOMEWHERE. AND WE WE WANT TO THANK YOU BUT WE ALSO WANT TO SAY YOUR WORK IS NOT DONE. THAT -- THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS BECOME THE FOUNDATIONAL SET OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT INFORM. OUR SYSTEM AND RECOMMEND DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUTURE -- STRENGTHS IN OUR SYSTEMS. AND THAT'S WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS THE REPORT THAT IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR THE FUTURE. AND WE WILL JOIN YOU IN MAP BUT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR WORK AS WELL I WANT TO FOCUS ON JUST ONE AREA WHICH IS -- THE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY AND I I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO CALLING OUT. THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON FIRST -- AND NOT AS PART OF OUR TARGETED UNIVERSALISM. AND WHEN WE TARGET CHILDREN AND FAMILIES MOST IN NEED THE ONE PROGRAM THAT WE WANT TO REALLY LOOK AT IS THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM WHERE EVERYONE BY DEFINITION IS LIVING AT BEST AT 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. NOT THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY MEASURE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT -- THAT VERY LOW LEVEL NATION OF TWELVE MONTHS OF STABLE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION IS SO IMPORTANT -- BECAUSE IF ANYBODY NEEDS STABILITY ITS CHILDREN WHO ARE LIVING IN SUCH DEEP POVERTY. AND THAT ALSO WILL DO WONDERS TO MEETING YOUR OTHER GOAL WHICH YOU MENTIONED WHICH IS TO CHANGE THE CULTURE OF COMPLIANCE TO ONE OF FAMILY WELL BEING AND SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN'S EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS. IN ADDITION TO STABLE CHILD CARE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SEAMLESS AND SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SYSTEMS CHANGE INCLUDE. ONLINE ACCESS TO THE DATA NEEDED TO KEEP FAMILIES AND ROLLED AND PARTICIPATING SEAMLESS TRANSITIONS. MAKING SURE THAT FAMILIES WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN OTHER VERY -- WORTHY PROGRAMS WHETHER IT'S HEAD START OR STATE PRESCHOOL ARE STILL ALLOWED ACCESS TO THE CAL WORKS CHILDCARE PROGRAMS. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE AREN'T THESE CONSTANT INTERRUPTIONS -- I THINK THAT THE REPORTS THAT WAS -- DONE WHAT WAITING TO BE. SEEN DEMANDING TO BE HEARD PROBLEMS AND I URGE YOU TO ADOPT THOSE CHANGES AS WELL MOSTLY I WANT TO THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHRISTOPHER MIRACLE HEAD START CALIFORNIA FIRST ONE I THINK THE COMMISSION THIS IS A BOLD. COMPREHENSIVE AND BALANCED ASSESSMENT OF A VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM AND I THINK IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENT. I ONLY WANT TO POINT OUT ONE SMALL IDEA. IN THE SECTION COMPENSATION THERE'S A STATEMENT REGARDING -- THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DIRECT COMPENSATION. OUR FOR LICENSED PROGRAMS RECEIVING STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC FUNDS AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT MANY OF OUR HEAD START PROGRAMS -- ARE NEITHER IN AND OUT IN AN ALLEY A AND MAY NOT HAVE A STATE CONTRACT AND SO THINKING ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT COMPENSATE HOWEVER WE INVEST IN COMPENSATION FOR THE WORK FORCE. THAT IT ADDRESSES EITHER -- FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL FUND SUPPORT OR APPROACHING IT FROM -- THE LANGUAGE OF ALL PROGRAMS PROVIDING SUBSPACE CARE. HAVING SAID THAT AGAIN WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS FOR PORT AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE VERY CHALLENGING IDEA OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO FIND THIS REPORT. SO THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KRISTIN POWER THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS WE APPRECIATE THE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO INVESTING IN CHILDREN BY PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY ASSESSABLE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION ALL CALIFORNIANS. IN PARTICULAR WE SUPPORT A NUMBER OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS DRIVE YOUR ATTENTION THREE AND SEVEN THE EXPANSION OF THE EARLY CHILDHOOD. EMERGENCY CHILDCARE BRIDGE -- WE WOULD RECOMMEND ON FOR F. ONE THE STREAMLINING OF THE PUBLICATION OF CURRENT EDUCATOR IN CARE GIVER COMPETENCIES TO FOCUS ON ESSENTIAL ADULT PRACTICES IMPROVE. CHILD OUTCOMES WE WOULD SUGGEST INCORPORATING TROUT. TRAUMA INFORMED TRAINING INTO THAT RECOMMENDATION TO ENSURE THAT THAT TRAINING -- INCLUDES THOSE TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICES THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU.

MY NAME IS THE LOOK AT A YOUNG THE VP OF OPERATIONS FOR MISSION NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERS. A. OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS CELEBRATING SIXTY YEARS OF PROVIDING -- EMPOWERING CULTURALLY ADEQUATE -- EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND SOCIAL SERVICES TO LOW INCOME SENIORS YOUTH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THROUGHOUT SAN FRANCISCO. I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF ESCO WHO ARE PROVIDING WHO ARE FACED. WITH THE ONGOING CHALLENGER PROVIDING QUALITY AFFORDABLE CARE TO OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS AND ONE OF THE STATE'S HIGHEST COST -- COUNTIES. THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE STRUGGLE TO A FOR THE EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH COST OF LIVING IN THE BAY AREA A STRUGGLE THAT IS FELT ACROSS CALIFORNIA. OUR CENTERS PROVIDE A RELIEF TO WORKING FAMILIES WE ARE A VITAL PART OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND AN INVALUABLE RESOURCE TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE ON A DAILY BASIS. WE STILL HAVE THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN ON LENGTHY WAIT LIST WHO NEED AND DESERVE ACCESS TO THE QUALITY PROGRAMS THAT ARE CENTERS PROVIDE BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO OFFER DUE TO THE LACK OF CURRENT PHYSICAL SPACE IN OUR INABILITY TO EXPAND BECAUSE OF THE COST OF UP COST PROHIBITIVE NATURE. OF ESTABLISHING OR EXPANDING NEW CENTERS AND THE LIMITED FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT THERE ARE FOR FACILITIES WITHOUT THESE CRITICAL INVESTMENTS FAR TOO MANY OF CHILDREN -- CALIFORNIA'S MOST WONDERFUL CHILDREN ARE LEFT WITHOUT ACCESS TO QUALITY EARLY LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES EXACERBATING EDUCATIONAL EQUITY A PERPETUATE THE READING THIS GAP AND THE OPPORTUNITY GAP. I ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP FOR YOUR VISION AND FOR RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE INVESTMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CONDITIONS TO IN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHILD CARE RESOURCE REFERRAL NETWORK. TODAY MY CHILD HAD TO ACCOMPANY ME AGAIN BECAUSE ON THURSDAY NIGHT I SAID -- SLEEP THERE'S NO SCHOOL ON MONDAY AS A TEACHER WORK DAY BUT IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THE PRIVILEGE THAT I HAVE AND HAVE HAD THROUGHOUT HER LIFE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST HEARING MACY'S SAT THROUGH. IN HER LIFE -- BECAUSE OF NO SCHOOL OR LACK OF CHILD CARE IN A PARTICULAR DAY THAT I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BRINGING HER WITH ME. AND THAT SO MANY PARENTS DON'T HAVE THAT THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A DAY THAT EITHER THEY TOOK OFF WITH NO PAY -- WITH THE WITH THAT FEAR -- HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU IRA IRA HAVE VERY ROSE COLORED GLASSES AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE SPARKLES ON TOP -- AND SO I LOVE THIS REPORT I FELT SO LIKE INSPIRED INSPIRED BY IT AND I I APPRECIATE THAT -- BOLD PROPOSALS THAT ARE THERE. AND I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT THEIR HEART THAT WE CAN DO THIS I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE -- YOUR RECOGNITION OF OF THE RACIST ROOTS OF CHILD CARE IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY FROM -- IF THE TIME OF SLAVERY AND ENSLAVED AFRICANS TAKING CARE. OF THEIR SLAVE OWNERS TO MODERN TIMES TODAY WHERE MOST CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ARE LOW INCOME WOMEN OF COLOR. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE ROLE THAT IMPLICIT BIAS. PLAYS IN THE LACK OF RESPECT FOR PARENTS WHO JUST NEED AND WANT TO GO TO WORK OR SCHOOL OR HAVE THEIR CHILDREN IN QUALITY. LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS FROM THE START AND HAVE THE SAME CHANCE THAT OTHER PARENTS HAVE -- I'D LIKE YOU I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING THE FACT AT AS TYING IT COMMISSIONER. SORRY MAKE MILLION SAID EARLIER SHE ALLUDED TO THAT WE REALLY HAVE THE POOR SUBSIDIZING THE POOR WE HAVE FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR PROVIDERS. TAKING CARE OF CHILDREN AND WHEN THEY TO HAVE TO DEPEND ON THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET AND THEY TOO ARE DISRESPECTED WHEN THEY GO TO GET HELP AS WELL. TIM THAT PARENT WHO'S FROM HANFORD AND FROM HIM -- AS AN ELIGIBILITY WORKER KNOWING. AND HAVING EMPATHY ON THAT OTHER SIDE AS SHE'S HELPING OTHER FAMILIES BUT THAT IS STILL LOST AMONG MANY FOLKS WHO ARE HELPING PEOPLE. AND THEN FINALLY I'D LIKE TO LIFT INDICATIONS FROM THE PARENT VOICES. FOCUS GROUPS -- THAT WE FOCUS ON AS WELL AS THE NETWORK BECAUSE OF OUR OUR UNDYING COMMITMENT TO FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND FAMILY FRIENDLY NEIGHBORS AND THAT IS THEY ARE -- THE MOST LIKELY PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE DURING NONTRADITIONAL HOURS. THEY ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE FOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE NOT PREDICTABLE SCHEDULES. THEY ARE MOST LIKELY AS AGAIN TO SUBSIDIZE -- OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE POOR BY HAVING A LOWER AND COST OF CARE AND CHARGING LAST FOR FAMILIES TO THEIR MOST AFFORDABLE. AND SO THEREBY GIVING THEMSELVES VERY LOW INCOME -- THESE PROVIDERS ARE SUBSIDY SYSTEM INSTEAD OF TWO DISTANT. DISTANT. TO NOT PROVIDE INCENTIVES. FOR PROVIDERS TO TO ACCEPT CHILDREN AND FROM FAMILIES TO REQUIRE SUBSIDY BECAUSE THEY NEVER KNOW THEY CAN'T DEPEND ON HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO BE PAID FROM ONE MONTH TO ANOTHER.

AND EMPHASIZE BILINGUALISM AND BY LITERACY. AND EXPANDING INVESTMENT INTO A LANGUAGE LEARNER TRAINING AND SUPPORT TO ACCOMMODATE THE MULTIPLE LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY EARLY LEARNING TEACHERS AND THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THEY SERVE. THE EARLY LEARNING FEEL NEEDS TO CONTINUE WORKING ON DEFINING THE QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE EARLY LEARNING WORK FORCE FROM BIRTH TO AGE FIVE IN ALL PROGRAMS ONCE WE DEFINE THE QUALIFICATIONS CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A LEADER NATION WIDE. IN CREATING A COMPETENCY BASED QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION SYSTEM THAT ENSURES ALL CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY LEARNING AT EVERY AGE.
