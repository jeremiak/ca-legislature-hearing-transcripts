WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT- DESPITE DECADES OF RHETORIC ON THE NEED FOR SAFE STREETS SMOKES CALIFORNIA STREETS HAVE GROWN MORE DANGEROUS IN RECENT YEARS ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION TWENTY TWENTY ONE SON NEARLY 20% INCREASE IN TRAFFIC FATALITIES IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS. COMPARED TO TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY NINETEEN S. B. NINE THREE TWO REQUIRES A COUNTY OR CITY TO INCLUDE IN ITS GENERAL PLAN A MAP OF THE HIGH INJURY NETWORK WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES AND FURTHER REQUIRE A COUNTY OR CITY TO IDENTIFY PRIORITIZE AND IMPLEMENT SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS. SOME MIGHT ARGUE THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE NOT CHEAP TEMPLATE IMPLEMENT BUT HOW CAN YOU PUT A PRICE ON SOMEONE'S LIFE EVEN WITH THAT BEING SAID WE ARE COGNISANT OF THIS CONCERN IT IS OUR INTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE CREATE AN ANNUAL GRANT PROGRAM TO AWARD FUNDING TO A COUNTY AND CITY UPON COMPLETION OF THESE TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES. AS A FATHER OF TWO YOUNG WOMEN IN THE END A RECENT ADVERT AVID CYCLIST MYSELF I'M SADDENED BY THE ALL TO COMMON TRAGEDIES THAT OCCUR IN OUR STREETS IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY WEEK THERE'S ANOTHER STORY IN THE NEWSPAPER ABOUT A CYCLIST INJURED OR KILLED.

ALSO NUMBERS CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. REGRETTABLY WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB NINE THREE TWO. I'M WE'VE HAD SOME GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND THE SUPPORTERS AND I THINK WE ALL REALLY AGREE WITH THE GOALS OF THIS BILL WE JUST HAVE A DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT VISION. ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ACHIEVE THEM AND SO. ISSUES THAT WE'VE OUTLINED IN OUR LETTER OF OPPOSITION INCLUDED THE NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WE REALLY THINK THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO ACHIEVING THE BILL'S GOALS BECAUSE OF LIABILITY CONCERNS OF THE ACTUAL COST. THERE AND- CITIES AND COUNTIES WANT TO DO THESE IMPROVEMENTS IF THEY DIDN'T WNT TO DO THESE IMPROVEMENTS WE WOULDN'T HAVE A TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. FOR THE EXISTING COMPLETE STREETS FEATURES THAT WE PUT IN ON OUR LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS AROUND THE STATE. WE DIDN'T WANT TO DO THESE IMPROVEMENTS WE WOULDN'T HAVE A MASSIVELY OVERSUBSCRIBED ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE SHARE THE VISION BUT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS. AND THE BILL NEEDS TO BE RE FRAMED AROUND THE RESOURCES THAT ARE REASONABLY GOING TO BE AVAILABLE FOR THESE PURPOSES. THOSE ARE THINGS WE SUPPORT THINGS WE WANT TO WORK TOGETHER ON BUT BY HAVING THIS NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WE REALLY THINK WE'RE UNDERMINING THOSE SCHOOLS AND SO. WITH THAT LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE BUT HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER LEE. ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINE THIRTY TO PLEASE COME FORWARD. RIGHT C. NINE AMADA. WILL TAKE IT BACK TO THE TELECONFERENCE LINE FOR ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO.

WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT IN OPPOSITION SB NINE THIRTY IN THE QUEUE THANK YOU MODERATOR HAVE CONCLUDED OPPOSITION NOW WILL ESTABLISH A QUORUM IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF MEMBERS HERE MISTER CHIEF CONSULTANT. SENATORS GONZALEZ HERE DOLLARS HERE BATES. FITS HERE ALLEN ARCHULETA YOUR AGILITY HERE BAKER. CORTESE YOUR CORTESE HERE DOLLY DALI HERE DOT. DOT HERE LIMON MCGUIRE. MELENDEZ IN MAN HERE NEWMAN HERE NEWMAN HERE RUBIO. SKINNER BY CASKEY THEY'RE BY CASKEY HERE WELCOME. EVERCORE OKAY GREAT THANK YOU MISTER SHE CONSULTANT WITH ESTABLISHED A QUORUM SO WE'VE CONCLUDED SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION TO WILL TAKE IT BACK TO MEMBER SENATOR MCCASKEY SO THE QUESTION OVER THE AMENDMENT ON THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRIBADI PEOPLE HAVE A PRIVATE BY THE FACT UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY THIRTY ONE THE UNDER THE BILL THAT THESE THESE GENERAL PLANS HAVE TO BE AMENDED BY JUNE THIRTIETH. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WHICH GIVES THEM EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO MEND THEIR GENERAL PLAN JUST A NOTE THAT LA HAS AN AMENDED THEIR GENERAL PLAN IN FORTY YEARS BUT MAYBE IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS THEY CAN GET IT DONE SO UNDER THE BILL AS AMENDED ON JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR EVERYBODY EVERY BICYCLE INTO. TWO LA OR ANY CITY THAT HASN'T DONE THE GENERAL PLAN CIRCULATION IS THAT AMENDMENT SUNSETS THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AFTER FOUR YEARS VERSUS KEEPING IT IN PERPETUITY RIGHT PROBABLY WOULD BE BETTER. TO TRIGGER THE FOR YEARS IS EVERYBODY HAS WITHIN TWO YEARS TO ADOPT THE PLAN THAT THE UPDATED PLAN IT PROBABLY AS I THINK ABOUT IT IT PROBABLY WOULD BE BETTER TO MAKE THE FOUR YEAR SPECIFIC TO EACH CITY'S ADOPTION OF THE PLAN- VERSES A BLANKET. APPLYING TO EVERY SPEAKERS DIFFERENT CITIES ARE GONNA BE A ADOPTING THEIR PLAN AND IMPLEMENTING THEIR PLAN ON DIFFERENT SCHEDULES. THAT MIGHT BE A BETTER APPROACH- BUT OBVIOUSLY I HAVE NOT DISCUSSED THAT WITH THE CHAIR SO I'M STICKING BY THE FOUR YEAR. SUNSETTHAT WE DISCUSSED. BUT YOU'RE RAISING APPOINTED TO STAGGERED IMPLEMENTATION IN EACH CITY. AND IN. I GUESS THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IT'S CONCEIVABLE ON NINETEEN YEARS AND ELEVEN MONTHS THAT SOMEBODY DIDN'T GET THE ROAD UNDER THIS PLAN THIS COULD BE ADOPTED IN IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO THEY WOULD SELL FOOD YOU'RE GETTING RID OF THOSE PRIVATE RIGHT AFFECTIONS I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT ONCE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT. DOES IT EVAPORATE I MEAN YOU DON'T EAT IT YOU YOUR COST OF ACTION IS CREATED BY THE LACK OF. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RIGHT RIGHT EXACTLY SO THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF IT WAS WE WANT TO. FOR CITIES TO ADOPT THE PLOT AND WE WANT TO GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES TO FIX THE PROBLEM WE WANT TO GIVE THEM THE DATED WHY DATA FIVE HOT SPOTS AND THEN WE WANT TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABILITY. ACCOUNTABLE AND SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO APPLY THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS IMPORTANT I'M AGAIN. I'M FINE WITH THAT THE CONTRACT WE HAVE THAT. WE HAVE. TO IT OUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO STAFF IT BASS ON A POEM. WE'RE IS SOMETHING OUT OF THIS WITH THE AIR BUT- AGAIN I THIS IS FINE WITH ME- BUT I THINK I DON'T THINK IT DOES SUNSET SO WILL GO AWAY AFTER THE FOR. WHAT I WHAT I'M GOING TO GO. THERE ARE SOME WHAT I'M CONCERNED IS ONE CREATE. A RIDE OF ACTION. AND IT'S ONLY A IT'S CENTER HIM FOR YEARS I DON'T I DON'T I THINK THAT THAT MAY BE AN OP. IT MAKE YOU'LL BE OP OPERATIVE TO THE- TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S IN THE PLAN THEY ADOPTED A PLAN THEY DID ALL THAT. AND THEY HAVEN'T CONSTRUCTED THAN THOSE PEOPLE WOULD LOSE THAT PRIDE RIGHT FACTION BUT IF IT'S NOT IN THE PLAN OR THEY HAVEN'T. DONE THE PLAN THAT WOULD THEY WOULD INITIATE THAT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND THEN ONCE THAT. IS ALWAYS THE LIABILITY OF A CITY. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE EXPLICITLY SPELL IT OUT OR NOT WE'RE NOT ABSOLVING THE CITIES OF ANY OF THEIR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS AND- PUBLIC A RIGHT TO ADDRESS THAT IF THAT'S YOUR- YOUR QUESTION. SO OKAY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CREATING A UNIQUE ONE TIED TO THIS THAT WOULD SENSE SO THAT'S THAT'S THE NEW MONTHS. MANAGER THE OTHER OPTION THAT I HAD IS. WE HAVE. EXPENDED A BOATLOAD OF MONEY AND SO SB ONE ON I'M- TRANSPORTATION AND WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT INVENTORY. WHAT EIGHT ACTUAL TO THIS. YEAR A WHOLE LOT OF BIKE LANES. GO GO IN. CAN I'M PEOPLE GETS. A QUICK BUT THAT'S THAT OKAY. I QUOTE IS TWENTY FOUR HOW. AND HOW ARE CITIES WHO HAVE NOT UPDATED THEIR GENERAL PLANS IN TWENTY YEARS GOING TO DO IT IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS AT THE RESOURCES THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO DO TO DO TO START THAT CIRCULATE PLAN ARE GOING TO DIVERT ARE GOING TO BE DIVERTED FROM ACTUALLY BUILDING THE BIKE LANE I GUESS SO. YOU CAME UP WITH THE TWELFTH AT IS THAT A REALISTIC NUMBER I GUESS MY CONCERN IS I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A REALISTIC DATE WELL TRULY I'M OPEN TO DISCUSSING WHAT ISRAEL I MEAN THERE'S A COMPANION BUDGET PIECE TO THIS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CITY'S PARTICIPATE IN THE GRANT APPLICATION TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE AT THIS MY GOAL IS NOT TO HAVE A PLANNING DOCUMENTS TO IT ON A SHELF IS NOT TO HAVE THIS BE EFFECTIVE SO I'M I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR INPUT INTO TIMELINE AND IMPLEMENTATION AND- AND- YOU KNOW WHAT IF WHAT YOU THINK MAKES IT STRONGER I I'D WELCOME YOUR INPUT. ON THAT. BUT I DON'T WANT SOMETHING TO BE AN EFFECTIVE AT THE END OF THE DAY. I SEE PLENTY OF GRAY HERE AROUND THE TABLE HERE WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE BEST TRANSPORTATION PLANS THAT WE'VE BEEN PART OF THAT HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED RIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO BE SUED OVER IT. I MEAN BUT THAT'S THE- YES. I SEE WHAT YOU WANNA DO I SEE THE BIGGER PICTURE I JUST HAD THOSE CONCERNS MANAGER. YEAH AND I IF I COULD ADD YOU KNOW WE WORK WE'RE- STILL DISCUSSING AND SO WE TALKED ABOUT THE END DATE IN TERMS OF THE SUNSET BUT YOU HAVE A GOOD POINT IN TERMS OF THE COMMENCEMENT DATE YOU KNOW WHEN WITH THAT ACTUALLY START. GIVEN YOU KNOW. WHERE CITIES NEED TO START REALLY RE EVALUATING REASSESSING THEIR PLANTS SO WE CAN YES I OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING WITHOUT THE CHAIR SUPPORT. I KNEW ONCE BUT IT DOES MAKE SENSE THE STAGGERED BASED ON EACH CITY'S. TIMELINE SO. YES AND THEN AGAIN THIS JUST- THE AMENDMENTS ALSO INCLUDE JUST TEN COUNTIES SO I HOPE RIGHT WENT DIRECT TO. THE DETAILS ON THAT IF YOU NEED THAT WE CAN PASS THAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THANK THANK YOU SENATOR DODD. YEAH COULD YOU COULD YOU REPEAT THAT WOULD THE TEN COUNTIES WHAT I DID NOT SEE THAT. YES AND WE WILL SHARE THAT AROUD I CAN SEND THIS TO YOU SO THE TEN COUNTIES ARE ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA LOS ANGELES ORANGE RIVERSIDE SACRAMENTO. SAN BERNARDINO SAN DIEGO SAN FRANCISCO AND SANTA CLARA. AND THOSE ARE THE ONLY ONES THIS WOULD APPLY TO DIRECT. WELL THAT MAKES A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR ME COMMENTS WAS CENTER WHICH HOUSE KEY. YEAH DO WE REALLY WANT TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO BE SUING. YOU KNOW THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY RESIDE IN OR THE COMMUNITIES OF DAY YOU'RE RIGHT BIKES AND I MEAN THIS IS ALL TAKE IT WAY TAX DOLLARS FOR OTHER THINGS WE COULD BE SPENDING I DO SEE ALSO THAT. THE NEED FOR COMMUNITIES CITIES COUNTIES TO THE FULFILL THEIR GENERAL PLANS TO MAKE GOOD ON THEIR BIKE PLANT BUT I ALSO DOES A COUNTY SUPERVISOR SOMETIMES YOU JUST DON'T HAVE ALL THE DOUGH. TO DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN THESE GENERAL PLANTS IT'S SO YOU MADE A STATEMENT CENTER PORTANTINO. HEY THERE'S GOING TO BE. MY REGARDLESS SO WHY DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A P. R. A. RIGHT RIGHT ACTION LISTED IN THE- IN THIS WILL. TO GO TO YOUR FIRST POINT. WE'RE GONNA A CREATE A PLAN B. PROVIDE FINANCING AND THEN SEE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT'S THE THIRD PETE THAT'S THE THIRD STORY. LEG OF THE STOOL IS TO SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE AS THE GOOD SEVEN FROM HUNTING CALIFORNIA MENTIONED. WE'VE ALL BEEN IN THESE SITUATIONS WHERE THESE PLANTS SIT ON A SHELF AND GET US. AND DON'T COULD IMPLEMENT IT SO WE REALLY WANT TO USE DATED- IDENTIFY THOSE HOT SPOTS AND TIE IT TO THE GENERAL PLAN AND THEN HAVE A HAVE A HAMMER AND I GET BENNINGER. SO I GUESS- NOT TO BE ARGUMENTATIVE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. IS IT'S THE STATE'S INTEREST. TO GO AND MICROMANAGE TRANSPORTATION PLANTS IN CITIES AND COUNTIES IN SHOULD WE BE USING OUR TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS TO BE THE- EVEN GIVING GRANTS I MEAN WE'VE ALREADY GOT THESE GRANT PROGRAMS EVERYTHING A VERY SUPPORT OF THOSE PROGRAMS BUT EXTRA BUDGET. YOU KNOW ITEMS JUST TO YOU KNOW JUST TO MOVE THIS POLICY FORWARD BUT THAT'S LIKE SAYING SHE IS IT THE STATE'S RESPONSE RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE. A BIKE NETWORK I MEAN YOU SEE ME A BUS NETWORK OR LIGHT RAIL NETWORK I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOVING PEOPLE IN THE MODERN TIMES AND HAVING SAY ALTERNATIVE MET METHODS OF TRANSPORTATION HAVING PEOPLE BIKING WALKING PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES IS PART OF CLIMATE REDUCTION I MEAN IT'S ALL TIED TOGETHER. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I WOULD ABSOLUTELY IT'S THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FOLKS IN A BIKE LANE OR JUST THE SAFE IS THE PERSON ON THE BUS SO. I ACCEPT THAT AND I THINK THAT'S A GREAT ANSWER TO THE- TO MY QUESTION BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IF THE STATE DOESN'T COME UP WITH A GRANT LET'S SAY FOR- SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY OR RIVERSIDE COUNTY. ARE THEY GOING TO BE HELD HARMLESS TO- YOU KNOW FOR THIS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO COMPLETE THE PLAN. AND IN IT DO WHAT THEY WERE TO DO BECAUSE LOOK AT. THIS WAS VOTED ON PRESUMABLY. BY STAKEHOLDERS GROUPS IN EACH COMMUNITY. AND ALSO ON TOP OF IT AND THE JORDY OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CITY COUNCIL. IT'S SO IT'S NOT THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT IT'S JUST THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES. MY ONLY CONCERN ABOUT THIS BILLS AS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. IT'S CENTER UNITE. HAD NUMEROUS TEXT LAST NIGHT ON THIS AND- I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M GONNA BE MOVED AUDIT EXCEPT FOR. YOU'RE NOT ON MY COUNTIES ARE INCLUDED SO. THERE MAY BE A BONUS VOTE HERE SOONER OR LATER WHO KNOWS. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD. BY THE WAY DID YOU NOTICE THAT NONE OF YOUR COUNTIES ARE INCLUDED. BUT BUT I DO REPRESENT EVERYBODY OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR DODD THANK HER AND SHE GOT UP. THANK YOU OF BEING A FORMER MAYOR OF THE CITY- IN IN A SMALL CITY NINE SQUARE MILES WE IMPLEMENTED THAT THE BIKE PATHS AND SOME PEOPLE ARE HAPPY WITH THE JOB OF THE REALLY UPSET. DEPENDING THE TRAFFIC- AND THE FLOW OF THE TRAFFIC BUT THE MANDATE- THE ENTIRE THAT MEDICARE WHEN YOU READ THAT LISTEN I HEARD YOU SAY- LOS ANGELES LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS EXEMPT FROM THIS NO IS IT LIKE LOOTED IT IT WILL BE INCLUDED. WELL LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS QUITE LARGE IN EVERY CITY IN AT THE- I MEAN IT JUST A NUMBER OF CITIES. MY KIDS WOULD BE. THE TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN- INTERCOURSE AS WE HAVE HEARD WE'VE ALL KNOWN THAT. THERE ARE SOME CITIES THAT TAKE TEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS EVEN TWENTY YEARS. TO UPDATE THEIR PLANS IN SOME CASES- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE EVEN FORESEE WHEN THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT. BUT NOW IT'LL BE A VIOLATION OF LAW. IS THAT CORRECT. THEY WILL PUT THEM RESPONSIBLE IF THEY IF THEY AYE IF THEY ADOPT A PLAN IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMS AND THEN FAIL TO ACT THEN THEY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST THEM BUT AGAIN THAT'S IMPORTANT. THEY HAVE TO CREATE THE PLAN. IMPLEMENT THE AND NOT SOLVE A PROBLEM SO THEY'VE GOT TO UPGRADE THEIR THEIR- GENERAL PLAN TO INCLUDE THE BIKES BICYCLE PATHS AND SO ON. BUT WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO BE GUARANTEED THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE MONEY. TO IMPLEMENT SOME INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES AND LESS THEY FEEL THAT IT WILL CALM AND YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS FROM NOW WHATEVER IT IS TWO YEARS FROM NOW. THANKS MY CHANGE AND WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO GIVE. THEY'RE STILL IN VIOLATION SO TWO THINGS A OBVIOUSLY I'M TRYING TO. USE THIS UNPRECEDENTED BUDGET SURPLUS TO HELP IMPLEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS B. WERE ALSO TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR THOSE CITIES. AND YOU KNOW IN OUR AREA WHEN DOES THE MORE RIDE BIKE TO MORE COMMUNITIES I GO THROUGH ONE CITY THAT'S DONE A GREAT JOB AND I'M I'M GONNA GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO ARCADIA I DON'T REPRESENT ARCADIA BUT I WAS RIDING THROUGH ARCADIA. LAST MONTH AND THEY'VE USED THEIR RESOURCES AND AN ENTIRE CITY WIDE BIKE. PLAN THAT'S YOU KNOW. RIFIC NOW THERE ARE ADJACENT COMMUNITIES THAT AREN'T AS GOOD. THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS IS TO NOT HAVE THOSE PLANS SIT ON THE SHELF. MANY CITIES AGAIN MY CITY HAS A SEVEN YEAR. RESURFACING PROGRAM THEY PRIORITIZE MAKING SURE THE STREETS ARE WELL PAVED AND SO THEY'VE SPLIT THE CITY INTO SEVEN SECTIONS AND OVER A SEVEN YEAR PERIOD EVERY SECTION GETS. NEW SLURRY IN NEWCASTLE I MEAN THEY'VE MADE IT UP ALREADY SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE CITIES UNDERSTAND THAT AS WE MOVE INTO THE- MODERN TIMES AND MORE MORE PEOPLE ARE. TRADING IN THEIR CARS ON EBAY LIKES AND MORE MORE PEOPLE ARE WALKING AND MORE MORE PEOPLE ARE WORKING FROM HOME YOU KNOW WE SAW THAT FOR THE- BACK. GOING ON THAT WALK. JOB PATTERNS PEOPLE PATTERNS HAVE CHANGED. AND OUR PRIORITIES NEED TO CHANGE- WE WERE BEEN A CAR ROAD CULTURE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS. WE NEED TO. BE THINKING ABOUTALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION AS WE BECOME MORE CLIMATE FRIENDLY AND MORE PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY AND MORE LOCALLY. ORIENTED IN OUR COMMUTER PATTERNS AND SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF LOCAL RESOURCES AND PRIORITIES AND THEN THE STATE OFFICE STEPPING UP WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGAL ACTION IF YOU DON'T DO. I'VE SEEN MIGHT. TO GET REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS- NOW I'VE NO YOUR HONOR IN IN SUBCOMMITTEE OF FINANCING AND SO ON I COULD SEE PERHAPS THE HELP THAT THE CITIES WERE LOOKING FOR FINALLY HAPPENED SO WITH THAT I'LL SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU. I THINK I SEE ANY OTHER. SUPPORT ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SENATOR DOT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE BILL AUTHOR- UPON FURTHER REVIEW THE VOTERS VOTERS GOT AWAY BECAUSE SACRAMENTO WHICH I REPRESENT PART OF AND CONTRA COSTA- ON THE LIST. SO THERE YOU HAVE A MINUTE TALK TO MAYOR RIGHTS. WELL THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION AND DEBATE MEMBERS- WHAT I WILL SAY IS YOU KNOW IN TALKING TO SENATOR PORTANTINO OF COURSE I WAS A LITTLE STRUCK IT FIRST ON ON THIS ISSUE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR. TO BEGIN WITH AND THEN WE IT TO THESE TEN COUNTY SO THANK YOU WORKING ARKANSAS. ON THAT- THE QUESTIONS REGARDING START DATE ARE VERY VALID OF COURSE FUNDING GUARANTEES WHICH IS NEVER GUARANTEED IN TERMS OF STATE DOLLARS IN FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR TRANSPORTATION. BUT I THINK IT PROVIDES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT DEEP NEGLIGENCE IN OF. THE AND COUNTIES THAT ARE DEFINITELY NOT. KNOWING REACTING TO THESE THIS NEED FOR VISION ZERO FOR.

IS AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT OUR BUSIEST COMMERCIAL LAND PORT OF ENTRY THE ULTIMATE SALANTER OF ENTRY IS NOT OVERLOOKED IN OUR STATE'S EFFORTS BENSON ZERO AND NEAR ZERO. VEHICLE CHARGING THIS IS. OTHER IMPORTANT. INFRASTRUCTURE RESOURCE FOR OUR STATE IT'S A MAJOR PORT OF ENTRY ANDAS WE SPEAK TODAY REALLY THERE ARE NONE THERE IS NO INFRASTRUCTURE TOOK TO SUPPORT OUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ELECTRIC VEHICLES- AND FRANKLY WHEN YOU HEAR THAT MANY AUTO MANUFACTURERS ARE NOW PROJECTING OUT INTO THE FUTURE THAT THEY WILL NO LONGER.

THE RACES ON IN OUR STATE TO TRY AND PROVIDE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE STATE TO SUPPORT THE NEW THE VEHICLES OF THE FUTURE. TEN FIFTEEN WERE FUNDING FOR NEW-LIGHT MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY ZERO MISSION AND NEAR ZERO EMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE TO THE STATE'S BUSIEST COMMERCIAL LAND PORT OF ENTRY DEAL TIME MAY SELECT ONE OF ENTRY.

BUT WOULD YOU WALK ME THROUGH- HYPOTHETICALLY IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN WHERE WOULD THIS THE INFRASTRUCTURE BE TO ACCOMMODATE PEOPLE COMING IN OR GOING OUT OF THE BORDER- WHICH HOPEFULLY WOULD INCLUDE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL BATTERIES AS WELL.

EVERY OF WHETHER YOU'RE COMING IN THROUGH THE- THROUGH THE MEXICO OR ENTRY INTO THE U. S. THERE ARE CERTAIN FACILITY SO THE IDEA IS THAT. THIS BILL WOULD. DIRECT THE OF.

SIX ONE THREE SIX ONE LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU SENATOR WESSEL SO WE'LL MOVE ONTO YOUR NEXT BILL FILE ITEM FOR SB ELEVEN SIXTY NINE STATE ROUTE ONE TWENTY FIVE TOLL ROADS THANK YOU- AND CHAIR MEMBERS- SB ELEVEN SIXTY NINE IS A BILL THAT SEEKS TO RETIRE THE SOUTH BAY EXPRESS EXPRESSWAY STATE ROUTE ONE TWENTY FIVE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHEAST SENEGAL- PORTION OF THE COUNTY. OF OR THE SOUTHEAST PORTION OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. THIS THIS TOLL ROAD WAS ACTUALLY- THE PLANNING STARTED IN THE NINETIES WHEN. WHEN NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN. THE STATE WAS SPEAKS SEE SIGNIFICANT ACTUALLY THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS OF THE BUILDING OF THIS ROAD THE STATE HAS ALWAYS HAD. BUDGETARY PROBLEMS. OF THROUGH THOSE YEARS IT WAS A PRIVATE COMPANY IN AUSTRALIAN COMPANY THAT CAME IN AND INVESTED SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD THIS ROAD AND IT WASN'T IN BUSINESS VERY LONG FROM THE DAY IT OPENED. THE USER SHIP- MOST OF BECAUSE A LOT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSCIOUS COUNTRY IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF SAN DIEGO ESPECIALLY THESE COMMUNITIES ON THE SOUTH A SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTY. ARE OFTEN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE OF SAN DIEGO SO. BUT THERE REALLY WASN'T THE ECONOMIC BASE ESPECIALLY DURING- DURING EACH ADULT TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES TO SUPPORT THE WHOLE. BUT THEY SOUTH BAY HAS GROWN ENORMOUSLY. AND NOW HAS A MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SOUTH BAY. THEY ARE IF YOU ADD THE BILL TO VILLAGE BUSIEST. LAND PORTS OF ENTRY AT THE BORDER. AND IF YOU ADD THE BUSIEST TRUCK TRUCK. TRUCK CROSSING. IN THE CALIFORNIA BORDER. YOUR SEEN HOW LIMITED FREEWAYS IN THE SOUTH THEY ARE REALLY NOT ENOUGH TO SUPPORT. UP THAT THE COMING AND GOING TO THE PEOPLE OF THAT REGION SO THIS IT'S SAD TO GO DOWN THE FREEWAY FIVE. DURING RUSH HOUR DURING ANYTIME OF THE DAY AND SEEN JUST LOTS OF TRAFFIC AND THEN GETTING ON THE ONE TWENTY FIVE AND SEE THAT IT'S COMPLETELY EMPTY. AND IT'S JUST A RESOURCE- THE OFF SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR RESOURCE THAT IS NOT REALLY. SERVING THIS THE NEEDS OF THE SOUTH BAY IN THE ECONOMY OF THE SOUTH BAY IN THE OVERALL ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THIS THESE CORRIDORS ARE SO IMPORTANT TO GOODS MOVEMENT. SO THIS BILL LOOKS TO ANALYZE THE POSSIBILITIES. OF WHAT THE STATE CAN DO TO TAKE OVER THE OPERATION OF THIS HIGHWAY AS IT SHOULD HAVE ORIGINALLY. TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF THE HOUSE THE SOUTH BAY TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE SOUTH BAY THE ECONOMY OF THE STATE. BUT THE STE THE STATE COULDN'T DO AT THE TIME BECAUSE OF ITS LIMITED BUDGETARY- THE PROBLEMS SO- WE'RE GONNA. I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF THE CHAIR AND ALLOWING ME TO. CONSIDER THIS AND THEN IT BRING THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF CALTRANS THE STATE AS A WHOLE. TO REALLY LOOK AT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS HIGHWAY TO THE OVERALL STATE OF CALIFORNIAN WHY.

SENATOR DOLLY. I'M OVER HERE TEASING WOMEN OUT SO. THE COMPANY THAT BUILT THE TO THE TAXPAYERS TO IS ARE THE TAXPAYERS OR THE OR THE- WHO'S ON THE HOOK FOR THE- THE MAINTENANCE AND- SO CAN YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE BACKGROUND HISTORY ON WHAT. WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THE WITH THE PEOPLE THAT BUILT THE ROAD IN. WELL THE COMPANY THAT BUILT THE ROAD THE LOSERS WERE THE INVESTORS RIGHT THEY INVESTED SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION HOPING THAT THEY COULD- GET A PROFIT OF THIS THEY COMPLETELY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS- THEY SOLD. THEY PUT THE TOLL ROAD UP FOR SALE THERE WERE NO TAKERS SO- SANDAG WHICH IS THE PLANNING ORGANIZATION MATHS AND YOU'LL FIND A WAY. TO PURCHASE SAID THEY'VE BEEN OPERATING AT. AND INITIALLY IT THE GOAL IS ALWAYS TO MAKE IT EVEN WHEN IT WAS BUILT ORIGINALLY THE IDEA WAS THAT EVENTUALLY WOULD BECOME A PUBLIC HIGHWAY. SANDAG ONLY MADE POSSIBLE THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN SOONER. THERE IS A BOND THAT THEY RAISED THAT WITHOUT BOND- IT IT HAS CERTAIN IMPROVEMENTS WILL NEED TO BE MADE INTO THE OFF HIGHWAY GOING FORWARD THAT IS ALREADY FOR THE MONETARY BUDGET IT. IT'S ALREADY THERE MONIES THERE. IT ALSO INCLUDES MONEY FOR MAINTENANCE. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATE COULD COME AND LOOK AT HOW THEY CAN SUPPORT. EITHER UP. CLOSE- SHE- THE PERIOD OF CLOSURE COULD COME ON COME ON LINE A LOT SOONER IS A FREE AYE WAY. OR AT LEAST HELP IN A WAY TO SUPPORT. REDUCING TOLLS SO THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO USE IT- ANYTHING LIKE THAT WOULD WOULD BE A WIN IN TERMS OF THIS REGARD TO THIS BILL LEAVES IT. OPEN SO THAT THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED AS THOSE OF THIS BILL WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY. ATTACH A TRANSLATE INTO THAT BUT IT IT WILL. HOPEFULLY BREAK MAKE THIS A PRIORITY FOR THE STATE. AND IN. THAT IN A WAY THAT WON'T DISRUPT. THE COUNTIES AND CONTINUED INVESTMENTS INTO THEIR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURES. ONE MORE QUESTION SO THROUGH WAS AT SANDAG THAT FLOATED THE BONDS AND FOR THE YES TOOL YES OKAY. AND THE STATE WON'T BE ON THE HOOK FOR THAT NOT. I MEAN THE IDEA IS THAT THE STATE COULD- REYES EITHER SOME FUNDS TO PAY INTO THAT OR- PAY INTO KIND OF REDO HELPING TO REDUCE THE BOND OR EVEN PAY OFF THE BOND. ABOUT CURRENTLY IS STILL A TOLL ROAD YOU HAVE TO PAY TO BE ON IT'S A TOLL ROAD AND LIKE S. AS MENTIONED IT'S REALLY NOT PERFORMING. TO ITS INTENDED. GOALS THAT'S UNDERPERFORMING IF IT IF THIS I MEAN FOR THE MATCH IN THE VALLEY OF THE STATE THE STATE DIDN'T HAVE TO INVEST SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION IN BUILDING A HIGHWAY THAT WAS ALREADY WITHIN THE STATE'S. RESPONSIBILITIES AND I MEAN THE FACT THAT THEY WENT TO PRIVATE ROUTE JUST BASICALLY REDUCE THE COST BY HALF AND NOW E'RE LOOKING AT. NOW THE COST BEING HALF OF THE HALF AND SO. WE'RE EXPLORING. THE POSSIBILITY. THE STATE FINALLY MAKING TRUE TO HIS PROMISES AND- OPERATING THIS AS INITIALLY INTENDED. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY. SENATOR BATES- SENATOR HUESO I'M STILL A LITTLE CONFUSED WE HAVE A NUMBER OF TOLL ROADS IN ORANGE COUNTY AS YOU'RE AWARE AND IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT TO THE COST OF TOOLS GOING UP TO ACTUALLY MEET THE BOND DEBT REQUIREMENTS IN THS SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT THE BOND IT WILL BE A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS- AS OF THAT DATE. IT DOES NOT HAVE PROJECTED THEY WOULD HAVE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO RETIRED THE BOND OUT AT THAT TIME SO TOOLS WOULD HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PAY OFF THE BOND DEBT OR THERE MIGHT BE ASSUME BY THE STATE TO PAY THAT OFF AND THOSE WOULD BE TAXPAYER DOLLARS CRAMPED. BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THE TOLLS ARE WHICH IS THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL TO ENCOURAGE TRANSIT INTO ACROSS THAT. TO LISTEN TO ENCOURAGE SENATE- CALTRAIN NOT IT'S NOT A STATUTORY CLOSURE. YEAH BECAUSE THAT I THINK THAT PART IS THE PROBLEMATIC PART THAT THE STATE DOES ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR RETIRING THE BONDS AND FOR THE WOULD HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE ROAD ALSO BECAUSE THERE'S A CONTRACT THERE RIGHT. OKAY AND JUST TO PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION YOU ALSO REPRESENTS AN EAGLE YU KNOW SEND YOU JUST HAVE TOLD THAT THIS IS THE ONLY ONE AND IT THE DIFFERENCE- OUGHT WHEN I WAS ON THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE HIGHWAY PROPOSAL'S. TOLL PROPOSALS TO ORANGE COUNTY WHEN I'VE SOUGHT SEEN THE ALIGNMENTS LIKE THE- WHAT IS IT THE SEVENTY THREE THAT'S THE TOLL ROAD THAT CUTS THROUGH. THE ARGUMENTS WERE OF THOSE HIGHWAYS WERE MORE INTENDED TO CUT- THE- ELIMINATE EASE A BURDEN ON TRAFFIC AND TO CREATE SHORTER ROUTES TO HELP PEOPLE GET THERE FASTER IN THIS THE CASE OF THIS- FREE WITHOUT WASN'T. THE INTENDED PURPOSE THIS FREEWAYS INTENDED PURPOSE WAS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO QUITE A BIT. OF NEW DEVELOPMENT THAT REALLY WENT OUT AND. EASTER CHÁVEZ TO. EXPONENTIALLY IN THIS HIGH. WAS REGION INTENDED PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR ALL THAT HOUSING AND IN SOME AREAS YOU HAVE VERY DENSE HOUSING. AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THE TRUCK CROSSING IN OTAY MESA WHICH ALSO HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY SINCE AMOUNT NINETIES THAT TRUCK ROUTE CROSSING. USED TO BE INSIDE THE C. THEIR OWN IT WAS MOVED EAST WHICH PROVIDES PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN. TO THE STREETS OF THAT AREA SO. BUT THERE'S A QUITE A BIG DISTINCTION WITH THIS HIGHWAY AND THE ONES IN ORANGE COUNTY AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ARGUING THAT INITIALLY THE STATE WOULD HAVE BUILT THIS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BUT DURING ALL THOSE TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES. THE STATE CAN MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS YEAH THAT WAS THE SAME IN ORANGE COUNTY. THEM OKAY THANK YOU WE HAVE NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS TO COMMUNITY IN A MOTION ON THE OF THIS BILL SB ELEVEN SIXTY NINE PLEASE SENATOR DODD THANK YOU MISTER CHIEF CONSULTANT CAN YOU PLEASE R.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- PRESENTING AB OR SB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX ON BEHALF OF CENTER GROVE- SHE SUGGESTED THAT WE TAKE THE FOR YOUR SUNSET AND LEGISLATIVE REPORTS WHICH CENTER GROVE WILL ACCEPT TODAY IN ORDER TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. SENATE BILL THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX INCREASES THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE GROSS WEIGHT OF FUEL HAULERS FROM EIGHTY THOUSAND POUNDS. TO EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS TO MATCH THE INCREASED WEIGHT ALLOWED FOR. OTHER TRUCKERS UNDER THE GOVERNMENT UNDER GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER NINE DASH NINETEEN TWENTY ONE. CALIFORNIA'S PORTS HAVE SICK EXPERIENCE INCREASED. YEAR OVER YEAR LEVELS OF CARGO VOLUME DESPITE EFFORTS BY ALL THE SECTORS OF SUPPLY CHAIN THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED THE GOODS PUTS SYSTEMS- CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY. IT IS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE FOR. FRAGILITY OF FOODS MOVEMENT SECTOR AND SUPPLY CHAIN FOR EXAMPLE THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH HAVE BEEN HANDLING AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF SHIPS ARRIVING AT THE SAME TIME DISRUPTIONS IN TRANSPORTATION AND WAREHOUSE AVAILABILITY. HAS SLOWED THE OFFLOADING AND OF CONTAINERS IN THE CAN AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE BACKLOG. GOVERNOR NEWSOM ANNOUNCED ON NOVEMBER SEVENTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT CALTRANS WOULD BE ISSUING TEMPORARY PERMITS ALLOWING. TRUCKS TO CARRY HEAVIER LOADS UP TO EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS- BETWEEN THE PORTS OF LONG LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH AND OTHER STATEWIDE PORTS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX. WE'LL TAKE THE GOVERNOR'S TEMPORARY EXEMPTION APPLY IT PER PERMANENTLY TO ALL FUEL TRUCKS THROUGHOUT THE STATE CALIFORNIA NEEDS LONG TERM SOLUTIONS THAT WILL NOT ONLY REDUCE EMISSIONS AND HELP ALLEVIATE CONGESTION ON. IT ALSO REDUCED DRIVERS IT TAKES TO TRANSPORT FUEL. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT SB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX WILL HELP ADDRESS IS THE UPCOMING FIRE SEASON CALIFORNIA'S DEVASTATING FIRE SEASONS INCREASED. INCREASES IN THE LATE EVERY YEAR SB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX WILL HELP FUEL HAULERS TRANSPORT MORE FUEL WHICH WILL EIGHT FIREFIGHTERS AS THEY BATTLE THE DESTRUCTIVE BLAZES THAT HAVE WRECKED HAVOC ON OUR STATE. THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IS NOT THE ONLY EXEMPTION THAT ALLOWS INCREASE GROSS WEIGHT FOR TRUCKS ON OTHER ROADS THERE ARE ALSO OTHERS. OTHER EXEMPTIONS THAT EXCEED THE MAXIMUM. LIMIT FOR EXAMPLE. TRANSPORTING LOGS ARE ALLOWED TO EXCEED THE FEDERAL LIMIT FOR THE TANDEM AXLES OF THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS BY FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS BETWEEN SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH AND MARCH FIFTEENTH. EACH YEAR COTTON TRUCKS THAT MEET CERTAIN CRITERIAS ARE ALLOWED ADDITIONAL SIX THOUSAND POUNDS THE FEDERAL LIMIT. FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS FOR TANDEM AXLES. YOU HAULERS WILL BE ALLOWED TO SAFELY USE THE SAME EXEMPTIONS THE SUPPLY CHAINS CRISIS COUPLED WITH DRAMATIC INCREASES IN FUEL PRICES THIS YEAR AND WITH THE FIRE SEASON FAST APPROACHING. CRITICAL THAT THE STATE DO WHAT WEEK WHAT IT CAN TO MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCIES AND REDUCE COST SB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX WILL PUT INTO LAW THE GOVERNOR'S EXEMPTION ALREADY RECOGNIZE THAT FUEL HAULERS CAN SAFELY INCREASE THE GROSS WEIGHT ALLOWED ON CALIFORNIA'S WROTE. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE OF THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX TODAY. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AS PRESIDENT CEO OF **** PETROLEUM TRANSPORT INC CONSTITUTION THE CONSTITUENT OF CENTER GROVE'S. ANY SPONSOR OF SB. THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX. THIS IS CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY SO WE'LL START WITH MR MAHER'S JOURNEY MARE'S **** PETROLEUM TRANSPORT. WELCOME. FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR ME TODAY MY NAME IS JEREMY MERS WITH **** PATROLLING MORE OUT OF BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA AND I'M GONNA BE SPONSORING THIS BILL THIS IMPORTANT MAJOR WILL HELP FUEL HAULERS- TRANSPORT VITAL RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE BOB AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS OF FUEL. THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY OR THE WHEELS OF AMERICA. KEEPING EVERYTHING MOVING. IF YOU TAKE EVERYTHING OUT OF THIS ROOM THAT WEHOLD ON A TRUCK. WOULD BE STANDING IN AN EMPTY LOT NAKED. WITHOUT FUEL DELIVERY EVERYTHING STOPS ALL THE CARS ALL THE TRUCKS. ALL THE SHIPS IN THE PORTS AND ALL THE PLANES IN THE AIR. THE POLICE IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT EVEN WORSE THE MILITARY. IT BE HELPFUL FOR FUEL HAULERS TO BE ABLE TO CARRY MORE FUEL- THIS 10% INCREASE IN WEIGHT WOULD ALLOW US TO DEEP DECREASE TRUCK. ROAD ROUGHLY. PERCENT THIS WOULD ALSO PRODUCE CONGESTION ON THE ROADWAYS. HIGHER LOAD CAPACITY WILL GIVE US THE ABILITY TOP OFF THE TANK THE GAS STATE REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TIME. WE HAVE TO TURN TO THAT SAME STATEMENT. WHICH AGAIN THIS IS ALL BROKE DESTINATION. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCE THE STATE ALREADY HOLD TO EXCEED THE EIGHTY THOUSAND POUND LIMIT FOR EXAMPLE GOVERNMENT ISN'T ALLOWED VEHICLES MOVING CONTAINERS IN AND OUT OF THE PORTS. VEHICLES TRANSPORTING LOGS AND I'M MUCH OF. DRYBULK CARRIERS OF OFF OF THE ALSO BEEN GIVEN AXLE WEIGHT RETENTION TO GO 10% OVER THEIR AXLE WEIGHTS. FUEL OUR SHOULD BE ALLOWED HAVE THIS. ASSEMBLY SB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX WOULD TAKE GOVERNMENT'S- GOVERNORS TEMPORARY EXEMPTION AND APPLY IT PERSONALLY TO ALL FUEL TRUCKS TO THE STATE BY ALLOWING THIS CHANGE THE BILL WILL HELP THE STATE IMPROVE ITS SUPPLY A FEW TIMES AND- DURING COHEN.

OF THE COUNCIL AND THE AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION- OUR PRIMARY CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL ARE AROUND SAFETY- WE HAVE LONG OPPOSED BILLS TO MAKE TRUCKS HEAVIER LONGER BECAUSE THE REALITY IS IF YOU HAVE YOUR TRUCK IS HARDER TO STOP HARDER TO MANEUVER AND IN THIS INSTANCE YOU'RE DEALING WITH A CARGO THAT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS CARGO WE HAVE ON THE- WE FOUND ALL THE- WE HAVE. YET FIRST- BECAUSE OF ACCIDENTS WITH THESE TRUCKS MAKING THEM HEAVIER 10% HEAVIER IS REALLY NOT THE ANSWER IN OUR VIEW- AND PUTS FOLKS THAT SHARE THE HIGHWAY WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS AND IN EXTREME DANGER I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER EXPANDED. TO THEY'RE DOING THAT'S NUMBER ORDER WHERE THERE'S READ PERCENT WHERE THE EAST PERMITTED THIS IS EVERYONE GETS TO DRIVE THE TRUCK- PERMIT A THE TOP TEN IN. SAID THE MOST INTEREST WE ON THE ROAD. IT'S NOT YOU KNOW A 100% OF THE TIME- AND THEN YOU KNOW LASTLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INDUSTRY THAT IS- YOU KNOW. RAKING IN THE PROFITS AT RECORD LEVELS RIGHT NOW- AND IT'S KIND OF IRONIC THAT THEY WOULD COME TO THE LEGISLATURE TO ASDA- PRESENTER SAID REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DRIVERS- IN OUR VIEW WHICH REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DRIVERS EXTRA EXPENSE OF- THOSE SHOWING HIGHWAYS AND WE ARE JOURNAL ABOUT.

THE ONLY THING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DRIVERS IN CALIFORNIA NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO OUR COST OF GOODS IS SKYROCKETING IN CALIFORNIA I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY THAT HASN'T BEEN TO THE GROCERY STORE DALY. YOU'LL PUMP TO FIT WOULD HAVE A CRISIS ON OUR HANDS AND PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO DO. AND THE SENATOR BROUGHT FORTH. SHE WOULD TAKE A SUNSET ON THIS BILL. AND TO TRY TO GET IT OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. YOU'RE ALL GONNA MAKE A DECISION TODAY WHETHER WE CAN ALL. YOU KNOW 10% MORE. AND YOU CAN TALK ABOUT FUEL BEING YOU KNOW. THE DANGEROUS WHAT'S IT IT'S DANGEROUS BUT IT'S NOT AND I IS MADE TO HOLD OUT WAIT THEY CAN HOLD THAT WEIGHT IN OTHER STATES. THEY HOLD LONGER LOADS. AND LOADS AND THEY'RE QUITE FRANKLY HELP ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND SAVING GETTING GOODS TO THEIR TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS. AT A CHEAPER RATE. AND SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT SAME TIME WITH THE SHORTAGE AND WE'RE PRICES WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TRUCKS THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING UP THE COST OF FUEL- CAPPELLETTI. SO THIS BILL THIS BILL IS BROUGH. TO TRY TO SOLVE A- WE CAN'T GET OUR GOOD STORE WE WANT AND WE WANT TO JUST ADD THIS. TO THE OTHER COMMODITIES THAT THE GOVERNOR. QUITE FRANKLY SEE WHAT WHAT COMES IN THOSE CONTAINERS. THERE'S CHEMICALS IN SOME OF THOSE CONTAINERS THAT COME FROM CHINA. THEY HAVE.

TWELVE TWO OF TWELVE TO SIX IS THE BILL BE TO MEETING THIS ZERO EMISSION GOALS BY FACILITATING PUBLIC PRIVATE NONPROFIT PARTNERSHIPS THROUGH JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY STRUCTURE THAT IS MEANT TO CREATE AND FINANCE GREEN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN THE GLOBAL EFFORT TO ADDRESS- THAT M. IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. I INCLUDING VERY AMBITIOUS- EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS GOALS BUT IN ORDER TO MEET THOSE GOALS THE STATE HAS FOCUSED ON REDUCING TRANSPORTATION BASED EMISSIONS WHICH ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SOURCES THESE BIRDS HAVE INCLUDED ESTABLISHING UNDER SEND THE PERCH OF ZERO EMISSION CARS TRANSPORTATION IS THE SINGLE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND FIGHT CLIMATE POLLUTION THE STATE NEEDS TO MAKE ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION MORE ACCESSIBLE AND CONVENIENT. THEIR TWO PRINCIPAL PROBLEMS FACING THE STATE OF. INTENT TO PROMOTE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE THE FIRST AND LAST MILE A PROBLEM WHICH IS THE DISTANCE THE COMMUTER NEEDS TO TRAVEL FROM A TRANSIT STOP TO THEIR FINAL DESTINATION OR VICE VERSA. UGH AND SECOND DESPITE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS UTILIZING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION NEARLY HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION DOES NOT HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS IN RESPONSE TO THESE PROBLEMS LOCAL ENTITIES HAVE LOOKED INTO NEW IDEAS AND TECHNOLOGIES LOS ANGELES SERVED AS THE PRIME HUB OF THIS TRANSPORTATION INNOVATION. WELL SEVERAL PROUD OF PROPOSED AND THEN TO WIN OUT AND OUT LOS ANGELES INCLUDE DAILY STREET CAR THEY REAL M. MONORAIL PROJECT A PROPOSALS THE NONPROFIT AND PHILANTHROPIC SECTOR HAS BECOME HEAVILY INVOLVED. THEN OPERATE BIG. THE MEN DOMINATED PUBLIC'S LIKE HOUSING AND SOCIAL SERVICES BUT NOT YET IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. SAME ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSIT SO PHILANTHROPIC INVOLVEMENT IN TRANSIT HAS MAINLY BEEN IN THE FORM OF FINE FUNDING ADVOCACY WORK AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ROLE BUT- ENGAGEMENT FROM THE PHILANTHROPIC AND NONPROFIT SECTOR IS GOING TO HAVE TO ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL CHANGE THEY CAN MOVE FROM STRICTLY ADVOCACY TO A DIRECT ROLE IN THE PROJECT. OF CALIFORNIA JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY LAW AUTHORIZES TO MORE PUBLIC AGENCIES BY CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT TO JOINTLY EXERCISE ANY POWER COMMON TO THE CONTRACTING PARTIES.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OPTION PERCENT S. B. NINE ONE SEVEN THE SEAMLESS TRANSIT TRANSFORMATION ACT MOTORSHIP MOTIVATION IS STILL SIMPLE REALLY WE SHOULD HAVE A WORLD CLASS TRANSIT SYSTEM IN THE BAY AREA RIGHT NOW THERE HAS THE SECOND WORST CONGESTION IN THE COUNTRY- NEXT LOS ANGELES AFTER BESTING BILLIONS OF PUBLIC TRANSIT RECENT DECADES ONLY 4% OF ALL BEER CHIPS ARE MADE WITH TRANSIT. IN RECENT YEARS EVEN PRIOR TO CODE RIDERSHIP ACROSS ALL TRANSIT SYSTEMS HAS FALLEN. UGH CHOOSE A QUALITY DROP BUSES STUCK IN TRAFFIC LONGER TRANSFERRING THIS FREQUENCY AS FAR FROM A SEAMLESS SYSTEM. RIGHT NOW IT'S TOO HARD TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B. MANY HAVE TO PAY TRANSFER PENALTIES SUCH A PAINT JOB LIKE EXTRA DOUBLE FARES FROM MOVING FOR ENTRANCE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER- RIGHT I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE LOOKING GO. BETTER MAPS BETTER SCIENCE MARC CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BUSES TRAINS LIHT RAIL AND- FERRIES. OTHER REGIONS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE TACKLE TRANSIT FREIGHT FRAGMENTATION WENT FROM. SEATTLE TO LONDON TO GERMANY AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO REINVENT THE WHEEL THE SOLUTIONS DO EXIST. SO THIS TAKES UP THIS BILL TAKES A MAJOR STEP FORWARD TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE SEAMLESS AND RESILIENT TRANSIT SYSTEM IN THE NEAR TERM WE'VE BEEN HAVING FOR YEARS- AND FROM THE BILL AND SOME STRUCTURE AROUND INTEGRATION. READ THE AD HOC WAY PROGRESS IS MADE UP UNTIL NOW. SO THE BILL TO FIRST STANDARDIZED WAYFARING AND MAPPING. SO WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL TRANSIT MAP RATHER THAN CURRENTLY TWENTY SEVEN DIFFERENT WAY FINDING SYSTEMS. NO MAPS AND SIGNAGE IS VERY MADE IT MAKES IT HARD FOR WRITERS TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE CONNECTIONS SECOND. REAL TIME TRANSIT DATA TO IMPROVE THE RIGHT EXPERIENCE WRITERS KNOW WHEN THE NEXT BUS IS ARRIVING ACTUALLY AND WHAT I COULD SEE THAT BUS LOOKS LIKE. THIRD WHAT IF I CONNECTED NETWORK PLANNED TO FOCUS OUR INVESTMENTS TO GET BUSES MOVING FASTER. MTC WHAT THE CLUB FORMS TARGETS FOR KEY. A ROADS IN OUR NETWORK AND PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR CAN'T TRAFFIC CONGESTION. FOURTH AN INTEGRATED FARE STRUCTURE. THIS MUST INCLUDE NO COST TRANSFERS ACROSS THEME AND LOCAL TRANSIT AGENCIES. ANY THE CURRENT TRANSFER PENALTY THAT REFER TO THAT MANY PEOPLE PAY. BY VIRTUE OF HAVING TO PAY DOUBLES AND A TRIPLE AFFAIRS METAL LEFT OF THEIR- RESPECTIVE TRIP. SEGMENTS MUST PROPOSE A COMMON REGIONAL FARE FOR REGIONAL SERVICE. AND PILOTING A MULTI AGENCY PASSED PRODUCT DOESN'T OCCUR BY DAY PASS AND GET ACCESS TO ALL BAY AREA TRANSIT. THESE POSSIBLE IMPORTANT WORK OF THE MTC FARE INTEGRATION TASK FORCE. UP AND HE'S ALREADY IDENTIFIED ALLOCATE A PORTION OF THAT FUNDING. THEY'LL BE NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. A BILL AND BACKSTOPS TO ENSURE NO AGENCIES WILL BE ASKED TO GO SIGNIFICANT. UNFUNDED MANDATES. WE WORKING EXTRA CLOSELY MTC IN THE TRANSIT AGENCIES. THANK YOU OVER THE FIRST ROUND OF AMENDMENTS ADDRESS NUMBER CONCERNS IDENTIFIED WE'RE CLOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM. AROUND THE FAIR CITY PROVISIONS THE BILL AND I'M COMMITTED TO FIND GET INTO PLACE FOR THE FEEL COMFORTABLE. WITH THINGS OR STRUCTURE TO PRESERVE THE SHERRY DUTIES.

TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT WHEN LITVAK SB P. PUBLIC POLICY VERY COUNCIL AND REBEKAH LONG. ACTING DIRECTOR LEGISLATION A PUBLIC AFFAIRS FIRM TO SEE. THANK YOU SENATOR PACKARD US SO WE'LL START WITH- WHEN LIFT BACK ON THE COASTLINE WITH THE AREA COUNCIL PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CARE GONZALEZ ASSEMBLY MEMBER MY NAME IS WHEN I WENT BACK AND THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC POLICY AT THE BARE COUNTS ALL. WE ARE PLEASED TO CO SPONSOR SB NINE ONE SEVEN THE SCENE WITH TRANSIT TRANSFORMATION ACT THEIR COUNCIL FOUND IN PART OVER SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE BAY AREA INCLUDING REGIONAL MEASURE THREE. AND MEDICARE ARE ARE. MOMENT OF. TRACK AND THE TIE HAS COME CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT TRANSIT POLICY. OVER THE PAST YEAR THE COUNCIL HAS CONDUCTED THE MONTHLY SURVEY TRACKING EMPLOYER ATTITUDES ABOUT RETURNING TO THE OFFICE. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT 70% OF EMPLOYERS ANTICIPATE EMPLOYEES WILL BE BACK IN THE OFFICE THREE DAYS A WEEK OR FEWER. EMPLOYERS ANTICIPATE THAT TWO THIRDS OF EMPLOYEES WILL BE IN THE OFFICE ON ANY GIVEN DAY. ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF THE WORKFORCE FOR MAIN FOR REMOTE AND 50% OF EMPLOYERS THINK THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES WILL OPERATE ON NONTRADITIONAL WORK HOURS AS OUR SURVEY DATA SHOWS PATTERNS HAVE SHIFTED AND NOW OUR TRANSIT SYSTEM MONTH QUICKLY ADAPT. FOR ITS VERY SURVIVAL. TO ATTRACT RIDERS TRANSIT MATH BETTER SERVE A GREATER RANGE OF TRAVEL TRAVEL PATTERNS NOT JUST COMMUTE TRAFFIC PART OF THIS IS MAKING TRANSIT MORE SEAMLESS USER. IN CONNECTED AT OUR REGION THE STRATEGY THAT THEIR INTEGRATION WAY FINDING AND SERVICE INTEGRATION FOR UNANIMOUSLY AGREED TO AND ARE REGION'S BLUE RIBBON TASK FORCE AND PRIOR PULLING COMPLETED BY NPC INDICATES THAT THESE POLICIES ARE OVERWHELMINGLY. POPULAR AMONG THE PUBLIC. I NINE ONE SO IS CRITICAL BECAUSE THE HOLDS UP ALL. DELIVER ON THE GOALS AGREED TO AND ARE REGION'S TRANSIT RECOVERY PLANNING AND MAKES TRANSIT AGENCY PARTICIPATION MANDATORY. WITHOUT SB NINE ONE SEVEN OUR REGION WILL BE VERY CHALLENGED IN DELIVERING AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM AND ANYONE AGENCY COULD HOLD UP THE PROCESS.

SORRY PERSONALLY ELSE HI- I'M TO THIS BILL REQUIRES MULTI FAMILY RESIDENCES IN CALIFORNIA AT THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION. TO PROVIDE ELECTRIC VEHICLE READY CHARGING ACCESS. NOT CHARGING STATION BUT ACCESS FOR EVERY HOUSING UNIT THAT HAS PARKING SO THE COMMITTEE HOUSES WHICH IS EXCELLENT- APPLE IS OUT THE GOVERNOR IS ISSUE. THESE PLEDGING PHASE OUT THE SET. INTER COMBUSTION VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE YEARS WHERE. ARE TO BE HIGHER STAY. HAS 7% THE V. CHARGING FOR OF THE CAL ENERGY AS IT WILL TO SUPPORT THIS TREND THIS. POWERING UP HOME AS THE CHEAPEST MOST CONVENIENT. MOST RELIABLE FOR DEALING AN EEVEE BUT THOSE BENEFITS ARE FAILING TO REACH COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THEM THE MOST. OF YOUR FOLKS YOU HAVE A SINGLE FAMILY HOME HAVE A PLUG IN THEIR GARAGE OR DRIVEWAY THEY CAN IN. ALL RIGHT THIS BEFORE BEING LIVE IN IN- MULTIPLE UNITS NOT OFTEN TO UP. READ IT IN CON AN APARTMENT AFTER THEY'VE BEEN CONSTRUCTED. BONTA MUCH MORE. THAN INSTALLING READY CHARGE TIME OF THE CONSTRUCTION. OF THE NEWLY UPDATED TWENTY TWO CAL GREEN BUILDING CODE REQUIRES EEVEE CHARGER ACT 4100% OF. ONLY FORTY PER CENT OF NEW MOST FOR. BASES OFTEN DISPROPORTIONATE INCOME COMMUNITIES WITH POOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. OUR STATE HAS A LOT OF WORK. ABOUT HEARING THIS COMMITTEE TO MAKE EASY CHARGING TRULY AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND I BELIEVE ONE KEY IS MAKING AT HOME CHARGING ACCESS FOR A- THIS IS. AN IMPORTANT THAT IS LET ME KIND OF INTO THAT AS IT IF A NEW SIXTY COM A PER SOME OF THE V. TO ONLY FORTY OF SPACES I RECALL PERRIN CODE BECAUSE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO WE ESTIMATED THIS YOU STILL. X. HOW 2% OF. CHARGING A WILL BECAUSE ONLY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ONLY POINT ZERO THREE OF THE OVER. RETROFITTING THE BUILDING LOW HOW WOULD CAUSE UPWARDS OF HALF AN YEARS. THE TWO THIS BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE CHARGING STATION IT JUST REQUIRES WE- DOWN THE GO SEX FOR FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO ACT. CHARGING IN A FEW BUT IF WE WERE ARE TO FOR. WHICH UP. WE'VE GOT WITH. THIS PICTURE IS BEING BUILT INTO A NEW BUILDINGTHAT ARE BEING. I'M NOW WE'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH A FOLKS REYES CAN ABOUT THE BILL AND WE'RE- COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM AS WE FOR. COMMON GROUND. ENABLE THE FOR. BUT THREE IS THAT WERE FOCUSED ON. YOU CAN. YOU DEFINING HI THE PER EVEY RAY CHARGING ACCESS DOES NOT OBLIGATE A LANDLORD OR BUILDING MANAGER TO PAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY TO CHARGE ANY RESIDENTS VEHICLE THAT'S OF COURSE IT'S OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE APARTMENT HONORED- AND LANDLORDS AND THEN FINALLY NUMBER THREE ENSURING THE LEGISLATION'S WORKABLE INSTANCES WHERE PARKING SPACES ARE NOT PRE ASSIGNED TO RESIDENCES THAT VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND REYES. BY FOLKS IN THE IN THE BUILDING- INDUSTRY AND- THE NECESSARY COST EFFECTIVE POLICY THAT WILL HELP US REACH OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS. DEMOCRATISE MATIZ ACCESS TV CHARGING. AND DONE. WITH ME- TODAY IS LINDA HUTCHINS KNOWLES FROM- ACT TERROR AS- A CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM AND THEN BY PHONE WE HAVE SPEND. THIESSEN WHO'S THE FOUNDER AND CO LEAD OF YOU CHARGING FOR ALL COALITION. ALLEN TOUCH ANGLES. AFTER SENATORS THANK YOU TO CENTER ALLEN FOR CHAMPION EVEN EQUITY BY OFFERING THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF THAT TERRA AND THE EASY CHARGING ACCESS FOR ALL COALITION PRO CO SPONSORS THAT SB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THIS PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE RESIDENTS OF NEW APARTMENTS AND CONDOS THE SAME ACCESS TO AT HOME PURGING THAT NEW SINGLE FAMILY HOMES HAVE ENJOYED SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN. HERE'S A TRUE STORY IN TWENTY NINETEEN REBEKAH LUCKY PURCHASED A LEAF SINCE HER APARTMENT BLOCKS CHARGING SHE DROPPED AN EXTENSION CORD TO THE GROUND BELOW TO CHARGE AT THE CURB WHEN THE MANAGER DEAN THE COURT IT THIRD SHE RESORTED TO PUBLIC CHARGING BUT IT PROVED A COUPLE QUOTE. I THINK IN OUR TO CHARGES THE DAY BREAKER FOR OUR FAMILY THE KIDS IN THE PLANO PARKING SPACE. THIRD S. CHART EXTREMELY HIGH FOR A BETTER RETURN HER EEVEE RESUME DRY A GAS CAR THE STORY OF THE FACT THAT LACK OF ACCESS AFFORDABLE SAFE AND CONVENIENT. PUTS EV'S OUT OF REACH OF MOST RESIDENTS OF APARTMENTS AND CONDOS ENSURING THEY GET SUCH ACCESS IS VITAL FOR EQUITY AND TO IT REACH OUR CLIMATE GOALS. BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AUG NEW CAR SORT OF THE STATE MUST BE ZERO EMISSIONS SO IT MAKES LITTLE SENSE TO BUILD NEW HOUSING WITH OBSOLETE PARKING SPACES THAT CAN'T CHARGE THOSE FEES. AND THE PUT OTHER AGENCIES LIKE CARBON THE CC ON THE HOOK FOR USING BILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO REPEAT THE SAME BUILDINGS AND JUST A FEW YEARS. CALIFORNIA MUST STOP DIGGING THE HOLE DEEPER NOW AND BUILD BUILDINGS THAT ALIGN WITH OUR EASY ADOPTION GOALS. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT FOR THE INCREMENTAL COLD PROCESS THE CODE UPDATE PROCESS TO CATCH UP ATHLETES. THE CLIMATE DAY A MEMBER. WE MUST STOP BUILDING HOUSING NOW THIS. WE MUST START BUILDING HOUSING NOW THAT'S PREPARED FOR THE CLEAN MOBILITY FUTURE RATHER THAN STUCK IN THE FOSSIL FUEL PASSED. AND A FINAL WORD ABOUT EQUITY. THE MAJORITY OF MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR IN COMMUNITIES HEAVILY BURDENED BY AIR POLLUTION. FOR TOO LONG THE CAL GREENE CO HAS PERPETUATED INFRASTRUCTURE RACISM. LUCKY MANY BLACK AND BROWN RESIDENTS OUT OF THE EASY REVOLUTION. VOTING AGAINST OUR ABILITY TO VOTE LEAVE 6270% OF RESIDENTS OF NEW MORE FAMILY HOUSING. WITHOUT ACCESS. DOUBLE C. LEVEL OUT CHARGING. PLEASE SUPPORT EQUITY EMITTING CLEANER YOU ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO YOU. MOVE ON. TO THE CO HOST MY- FOR MISTER SMITH. AT THE SAN EVEY CHARGING FOR A- I AM SEVENTY SENATE MENTION HERE WITH EIGHTEEN YEARS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE EXPERIENCE THAT HE JEANNIE AND IT'S ALL CLEAN ENERGY AND MY OWN IN THE CONSULTING FIRM. COALITION IS GETTING TO EXPANDING ACCESS EASY CHARGING MINIMIZING COSTS THE COMPLEXITY BUILDERS RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO OPERATE THESE BUILDINGS. WE DID NOT ARE. THANKS FOR IN CALIFORNIA BUT ANY FLAMES THIS BILL IS A COST PROHIBITIVE MANDATE IS INACCURATE. THERE ARE SEVERAL PROVISIONS THAT ACTUALLY KEEPS BUILDING COSTS AS LOW AS POSSIBLE. FIRST CHOIR THAT EVERY PARKING SPACE IN A MULTI FAMILY COMPLEX BE WIRED FOR EACH CHARGING INSTEAD TO PROVIDE THAT EVERY NEW UNITS WITH PARKING HAS ACCESS TO ONE HE BEAT READY PARKING SPACE FOR EXAMPLE IF A ONE HUNDRED YEAR COMPLEX HAS TWO HUNDRED PARKING SPACES ONLY A GREAT ALLOW PATIENTS ALL. HUNDRED THE BILL MINIMIZE BILL COMPLEX IN COST. HOW GREENS READ THE V. D. THIS SIMPLY LOW POWER REDUCES OPERATIONAL BY ENCOURAGING RUNNING THE WIRING YEAH EACH UNIT METER RATHER THAN THE COMMON HERE THIS ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR OVERSIGHT BY APARTMENT MANAGEMENT. WHAT THE H. AWAY WHILE ENABLING RESIDENTS ACCESS TO THEIR UTILITIES LOW WITH ELECTRIC RATES. AN EXPERT REVIEWED ECONOMIC ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THIS BILL WILL ONLY INCREASE NEW BUILD COSTS BY. ZERO POINT ZERO THREE PERCENT. BROKERAGE PROJECTED THAT BETWEEN TWENTY THREE. THANK THE FIVE NOT THOUSAND BRAND NEW UNIT WILL REQUIRE RECTOR PHILIPPINE AND UTILITY PROVIDED COST ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FORCES ONLY TWENTY SEVEN MILLION TO WIRE THEM THE TIME UP IN THE- FINALLY. JUSTICE OTHER STATES FOLLOW OUR LEADERSHIP THIS BILL WILL FURTHER ACCELERATE EVEN ADOPTION BOOSTING OUR LARGEST EXPORT ELECTRIC VEHICLES WHILE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE AND FOR THE BOTH THE MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTS APPROVE SB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO TODAY THANK YOU.

AND IS KIND BE HARMFUL TO ACHIEVING OUR CALL SO THAT WE CAN LIVE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED A SCORE. AND MOVED WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER SENATOR. YES THANK YOU MEDICARE- I AM GOING TO- SUPPORT THE BILL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT. I WILL LOOK AT IT AGIN ON THE FLOOR. AND I COMMEND THE AUTHOR. TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. OF GREATER LOS ANGELES TO WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. AND BUILDING INDUSTRY. AND THE SENATOR HAS A HISTORY. OF WORKING ON THE FIFTY YARD LINE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT. AND I SEE THAT WE'RE ALMOST THERE. AND I AM HOPING. WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT- I FORESEE. WILL BE ABLE TO GO FORWARD WITH THE- AS WE- ON THE- JUST. THERE WE- MANY IN THE TOP AND I THAT SO THAT PROVED THAT EVEN THAT I KNOW WORKED WITH THE OPPOSITE TO GET THIS OVER LOOK FOR TO PASS IT ON THE SENATE BUT I DO RESERVE THE RIGHT AND I THANK YOU FOR. THANK AT RG LET US UNDER. CHAIR I ALSO AND I THINK THE AUTHOR WE'VE HAD EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AND I DO AGREE WITH THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND SUPPORT THE GOAL OF THE BILL BUT I DO HAVE CONCERNS AS IT PERTAINS TO THE EQUITY WE'RE TRYING TO SELL. SEVEN EQUITY ISSUE AND I'M- YOUR WE'RE GOING TO CREATE ANOTHER. TO AS WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE ONE. IN PARTICULAR YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THE- COMMITTEE. ANALYSIS TALKED ABOUT. AT LEAST COSTLY WAY OF DOING IT ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS IT'S STATES THAT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AS- THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEVEL THREE FAST CHARGING. EIGHT EIGHT LESS EXPENSIVE OPTIONS THE REQUIRED LEVEL TWO CHARGING AT EVERY PARKING SPACE THAT COMMITTEE ANOTHER SUGGESTS RETROFITTING A FEW LEVEL. CHARTERS ABBOTT MUCH COST. I KNOW THE AUTHOR STATED THE COST AND IT SEEMS MINIMAL BUT- NOT TOO LONG COME COMMUNITIES. THAT MAY BE SUBJECT BETWEEN THEM HAVING ACCESS. RB LEFT OUT ALTOGETHER SO AGAIN I WANT TO SURE THAT WE NOT TRYING TO SOLVE EQUITY ISSUE INCREASE ANOTHER. ALL BUT ALSO- I JUST YOU KNOW AND I KNOW HE'S BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD SO I DO APPRECIATE THE OUT THERE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I KNOW HE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO- BUT AGAIN IT'S- YOU KNOW WITH A LITTLE BIT AS A TEAM. I'M NOT SURPRISED BAD I THINK IT'S A GOOD I THINK THE INTENT IS YOU KNOW THERE. BATTLE IF YOU WERE JUST CONSIDER A LITTLE. JUST EXPLORING THE PA. OF LESS. CHARGING STATIONS BUT A LITTLE BIT MORE POWERFUL THE LEVEL THREE. I JUST WOULD BE MY HOUSE BUT THINK I WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY. MENTORS ONE. YES SENATOR RUBIO HE'S GOING TO RESPOND AND THEN WE HAVE SENATOR CRITICAL READ AT MY I APPRECIATE THAT PRESERVE THE COME A GREAT DEAL AND I YOU KNOW I THINK ULTIMATELY WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO IS TO DO A DEEP DIVE- I BELIEVE THE WAY THE NOZZLES WRITTEN IT'S IT MAY BE LESS EXPENSIVE. WHAT WE NEED GET. GET DOWN TO THE FAX OF WHAT THE COST COMPARISONS ARE AND WHAT THE FTC IS SO THAT WE REALLY CAN MAKE SURE THAT- WE WERE WERE ABLE TO HAVE ALL THE- INFORMATION AT OUR HANDS. THIS PROFIT. AND SO I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE IN THAT AND THAT THE COMMITTEES. STAFF TO REALLY GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE DATA THAT WE HAVE SO WE CAN REALLY MAKE A WISE DECISION WHEN IT COMES TO THE BALANCE. I WOULD LEVEL WITH OF A THREE. I APPRECIATE THAT. VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO CENTER CORTESE. YES- THINK MANAGER IN INTO THE AUTHOR OF I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING IT MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SUPPORTING THE BILL- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. RELATIVE TO THE INDUSTRY WHICH IS BASICALLY THE OPPOSITION- FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES- DO NEEDS TO BE SOME PROCESS FOR THEM- ALTERNATELY TO WORK WITH- THE AGENCIES STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE- OR OR WILL BE INVOLVED IN YOU KNOW IN EITHER UPDATING CODER OR BUILDING REQUIREMENTS AND I'M SURE THE AUTHORS TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND THAT'S PROBABLY PART OF THE ON GOING TO THE INDUSTRY I CAN'T THINK OF. A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL WOULD HAVE TO TWO FORTY CIRCUITS COMING INTO IT. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT COMES IN OFF THE MAIN POWER NO I MEAN REALLY WHAT WE CALL ONE TWENTY ISSUES. TO FORTY SPLIT RIGHT- SO SOME OF IT IS YOU KNOW I THINK REAFFIRMING WE KNOW. SHOULD CODES SO NOBODY'S KNOW THAT SLIPS BY WITH OTHER PARTS OF IT ARE- I THINK OR- FOR MORE PURPORTED TO BE MORE PRACTICAL CONCERNS BY THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF. A DESIGNS AND YEAH AND OTHER SITE CONSIDERATIONS I REMEMBER. THE BUILDING MULTI FAMILY PACKAGE- MY PRIOR EXISTENCE IMPORTING THE SIDEWALKS BEFORE WE FIGURED OUT WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO WALK AND- IT WAS SO IT WAS SORT OF A MISTAKE IF SOMEBODY CAME UP LATER IN SAID- YOU KNOW YOU YOU WANT TO WAIT BEFORE. YOU WALK IN DETAILS UNTIL YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE HE SAID SHE WHERE YOUR CUSTOMERS WANT TO GO SO I'M SURE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE- IN SOME OF THE TENSION PURPOSE THE OPPOSITION'S PEOPLE RIGHT NOW WORRIED THAT- YEAH I DON'T AGENCY SOMEBODY'S GOING TO COME IN. YOU KNOW SORT OF A BICYCLE ALL I'M IN AND I THINK IT'S VERY AVOIDABLE IN THE VERY WORKABLE- TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. TO HAVE THAT KIND OF- INPUT. YOU KNOW TO SORT OF FINISH THE BILL OFF SO AGAIN I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OBVIOUSLY GREAT I JUST TALK ABOUT OPPOSITION LAWYER. AN OUTSTANDING THE- PORT- MANY OF THEM FROM THE BAY AREA AND- FREE SHEARED PRESHEAF HEARING THAT- AND- THAT'S ALL IT THAT'S ALL I REALLY WANT TO GET ON THE RECORD THANK YOU YEAH. KEYCENTER QUICKLY ACC NO OTHER MIKES UP US THE- MOVE THE BILL BY SENATOR NEWMAN I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU SENATORALAN FOR YOUR WORK AND I'LL CONTINUE AS- I MENTIONED BEFORE WITH THE OPPOSITION- AND- YOU KNOW THIS IS AGAIN A BIG ISSUE IF YOU WANT TO HIT OUR GOALS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE- ASSIST. IT'S PAST- IN A GO NOW. IS SENATOR BY REVISED. BUT I JUST WANTED TO OFFER THE COMMENTS APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T WANT TO THROW COLD WATER ON AFTER. THIS BUT- BUT I I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I WANT TO APPLAUD YOUR EFFORTS ARE MADE TO REDUCE THE COST. OF TO TWO. BILLION THE- REPUBLICAN CAUCUS REALLY REYES A VERY IMPORTANT POINT IN TERMS OF OPPOSITION WHERE THERE'S A POTENTIAL INCREASE ELECTRIC RATES BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO UPGRADE THE LOCAL- JUST USE A NETWORK TO SELL THEM THOSE COSTS ARE ALWAYS FUN TO THE RATE PAYERS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. BEING STATIONS AND FAMILY. THOUGH THE WILL BE AREAS WHERE THEY FLOWING. FOUNDER THAT THAT IS THE KIND AND I JUST ASKED YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT GOING FORWARD AND WHAT THAT WOULD. KNOW THE YOUR LIMIT AND THEN BUT THAT IS THE POTENTIAL. AFFECT RATEPAYERS WITH THE INSULATION I THINK THOUGH FOR BIG DEFEAT TO THE SHE- BE UP THIS STREET FOR. FORWARD SUPPORT BUILT. YEAH I COURSE THE MINNESOTA REALLY JUST MEANS IT MORE. LOWER INCOME PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO A IN THEIR GARAGE. SO. YEAH I MEAN SO IF THE QUESTION IS COMES TO ME THAT THE BROADER QUESTION IS WE CLEARLY NEED MORE TRANSMISSION CAPACITY. I TO MEET OUR ELECTRIC BILLS WRIT LARGE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT AND THAT WILL TAKE INVESTMENT EFFECT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AND SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS TODAY THAT THAT'S GONNA BE. PART OF THE BUDGET- BUT- BUT IT BUT IT WILL SAVE ME FROM AN EQUITY PERSPECTIVE THIS ACTUALLY IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT MAKING SURE. THAT A LOT OF FOLKS- I TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT I CAN. HAVE AG ALLEGES LEXICAL ACCESS IN MY GARAGE IS THE SITE NOT A REALITY FOR THIS. BUT LARGE NUMBER OF LOWER NCOME PEOPLE AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS IN THEIR GARAGE ELECTRICITY I. DISAGREED ALL THE THIS IS. THE SOUTH. PEOPLE ARE NOT YOU THERE'S BEEN A PAPER. AND OUT OF THE ISSUE WITH THE- ALL OF THE- CHARGING. STATION THAT THROUGHOUT OUR- THIRTY NO RATE. ARE GOING TO GET BE PAYING FOR THAT LOWER THE- OF WEAKER HAVE. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A REALLY AND I. OF THAT AND I THINK THOSE THINGS GET LOST. IN THE GOAL OF LIFE THAT OF HAVING A OBJECTIVES TO MEET THOSE GOALS FOR. OBJECTIVE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION. THE COST OF THAT ARE. YOU KNOW- IT HERITAGE. IN INCREASING THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK FOR ELECTRICITY YES I'M JUST SAYING WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT. AND IT WILL BE A SPIT. OUT GREAT. YEAH WHEN IT HAS HE TO WHAT IT IS. IT'S THAT WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW WITHIN THE TWO THE TO KEEP ONES TO BE HONEST OUR THAT ISSUE RIGHT TO HOW DO YOU WHO PAYS RIGHT SO WHAT WHAT SORT OF MECHANISM TO HAVE IN PLACE. TO YOUR EQUITY WHEN IT COMES TO THE PERSON WHO'S USING ELECTRICITY TO PAY FOR ELECTRICITY- AND THEN THE OTHER ONE HAS TO DO WITH PRE PRE ASSIGNED PARKING SPACES WHICH I GUESS IS IN A RELATED RIGHT I MEAN HOW HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT- YOU CREATE A SYSTEM OF COURSE YOU KNOW FOR SO MANY OF US I MEAN IT I MEAN H. A. WHERE. WE ALL PAY COLLECTIVELY WATER SO THERE'S NO YOU KNOW WHOEVER USE A LOT OF WATER IS SICKLY AFTER WEST WEEK THE BILL ON IT ARE YOU. SO THIS IS THIS IS THE POINT AND IN I REALLY INVITE ANYONE. HOW WE WRITE THIS IN A WAY THAT WILL. MAKE IT FAIR FOR EVERYBODY- I PLEASE HELP US BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF THE ONE OF THE KEY STICKING POINTS WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH WITH INDUSTRY. GOT Q.

ALL RIGHT AND NEXT WE'LL MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM SIXTEEN SENATOR ARCHULETA SB TWELVE FORTY NINE SENATOR YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER- IN THE- WHICH IS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR YOUR PATIENCE HAS BEEN A LONG DAY. TO APPRECIATE. WHICH AGAIN TODAY I'M PRESENTED SENATE BILL TWELVE FORTY NINE WHICH SEEKS TO MODERNIZE THE NON GOVERNMENTAL CHARGE KNOWN AS THE DOCUMENT PROCESSING CHARGE THAT AUTO A REAL DEALERSHIPS MAY COLLECT IN ORDER. OVER THEIR PAST. APRIL ARM TO COMPLETE VEHICLE SALES AT LEAST TRANSACTIONS. CALIFORNIA DEALERSHIPS PROVIDE A ONE STOP SHOP FOR CONSUMER SERVICES INCLUDING DMV TRANSACTIONS LOAN PROCESSING PRIVACY AND FRAUD PROTECTION CONTRACT- GRANT ACTIONS AND TRANSLATIONS VEHICLE TRADE IN SERVICES WAR TO SERVICES AND OF COURSE MUCH MUCH MORE. WITHOUT DEALER BASE DOCUMENT PROCESSING SERVICES CUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT STEPS ON THEIR OWN TO PROCESS A COMPLETE BILL BIRCH. OR LEASE RENT INCLUDING INTEREST DEPARTMENT MOTOR VEHICLES TO COMPLETE MULTIPLE STEPS GOING TO AND FROM THE BANK- SHOP. EACH ON THE ROAD VS PARTY RIGHTS NOPE PER AVAIL. TO COVER THIS STAFF TIME AND COST THE TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THESE OBLIGATIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY ALLOWS AUTOMOBILE DEALERSHIPS TO COLLECT A STATUTORY MAXIMUM DOCUMENT PROCESSING CHARGE OF ONLY EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS PER TRANSACTION. THE DOCUMENT PROCESSING CHARGE LIKE OTHER CHARGERS AND CONSUMER CHARGES MUST BE ITEMIZED AND EXPLICITLY DISCLOSED TO CONSUMERS PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE OF THE VEHICLE AND THEY WILL BE. AND THEY CONTINUED TO BE. THREE MAXIMUM EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS IS BY FAR THE LOWEST DOCUMENT PROCESSING CHARGE IN THE COUNTRY AND AMOUNTS TO A FOURTH OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR THOSE WONDERING THE NATIONAL AVERAGES THE AVERAGE DOCUMENT PROCESSING CHARGE BEING CHARGED AND ALL FIFTY STAGE WHICH IS MUCH. MUCH LOWER THAN CALIFORNIA MUCH HIGHER THAN CALIFORNIA WHICH INCLUDES STAGE WITH STATUTORY CAPS LIKE CALIFORNIA THE STATE WITH NO CAPS AT ALL I WAS APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER- THE REQUESTED WE'RE MAKING WILL BE- A LITTLE HIGHER AT A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS WE'VE SHARED THAT INFORMATION WITH THE CHAIR AND SHE'S AGREED TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS NOT TO. IS DOABLE TWELVE FORTY NINE WOULD BEGIN IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND OVER A SIX YEAR PERIOD MODERNIZE THE NON GOVERNMENTAL CHARGE THAT OUR DEALERSHIPS MAY COLLECT WHEN SELLING OR LEASING A VEHICLE TO ENSURE THAT THE DEALERSHIPS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES CAN OVER THEIR COSTS THAT CONTINUE PROVIDING IMPORTANT SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AT THE TIME OF THE OF THE VEHICLE PURCHASE NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT. THE SIMPLER APPROACH BY PUTTING CALIFORNIA IN LINE WITH THE STATE'S LIKE NEW YORK AT IS WE HAVE. I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT AND THAT I WOULD PUT CALIFORNIA FROM. AFAR FOR LOWEST RATE TO A NATIONAL. AVERAGE BELOW THE AVERAGE ACTUALLY AND WE WILL CONTINUE THE PROGRESS AT WITH ME TODAY AND TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL IS ANTHONY SAMPSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION. BOB SMITH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE GREATER LOS ANGELES CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION. AND MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS- AT THE TIME THANK YOU CENTER ARCHULETA MISTER SIMPSON. BUT AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ANTHONY SAMPSON THE SAMPSON ADVISORS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION CNC DA IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR SB TWELVE FORTY NINE. AND WE APPRECIATE SENATOR ARE TO LET IS HARD WORK ON THE MEASURE AS WELL AS THAT CHAIRWOMAN COMMITTEE STAFF ENGAGEMENT TO DATE. SENATE ARCHULETA DID AN EXCELLENT JOB SUMMARIZING THE BILL SO I JUST LIKE TO FOCUS ON A FEW POINTS. IT'S RECOVERING CLASS THIS FUNDAMENTAL ANY BUSINESS THAT BE A LOCAL MONPA SHOPS. OR A LARGER BUSINESS MANY BUSINESSES RECOVER THEIR COSTS BY IMPOSING VARIOUS CHARGES THAT GO BY DIFFERENT NAMES CORDIC CONVENIENCE CHARGE SERVICE CHARGE I SAW DEPRECIATION CHARGE RECENTLY ESCROW CHARGE. AND RECENTLY A LARGE ONLINE RETAILER. ADDED A FOOD FUEL AND INFLATION CHARGE. CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT THOSE CHARGES EXIST SO THAT BUSINESSES CAN RECOVER THEIR COST OF DOING BUSINESS WHICH IS STARKLY SPEAKING INCREASE OVER THE COURSE OF TIME. AND THAT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN TRUE OF INCREASING OUR PATIENTS PLACED ON NEW CAR DEALERS. BUT WHAT IS UNIQUE IN THE CONTEXT OF AUTO DEALERSHIPS IS THAT FOR SEVERAL DECADES. CALIFORNIA LAW HAS BACKED DID THAT HAS DESIGNATED THE DOCUMENT PROCESSING CHARGE A STATUTORILY CAP CHARGE AS THE MECHANISM TO COLLECT COSTS. A SO CLEAR DEALERSHIPS VIEW THE DOCUMENT PROCESS CHARGE AS THE EXCLUSIVE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH IT CAN RECOVER ITS DOCUMENT PROCESSING COSTS. SO WHILE BUSINESSES OF ALL TYPES CONTINUE TO IMPOSE NEW OR INCREASED CHARGES AND FEES TO COVER THEIR COSTS. AUTO DEALERSHIPS MUST CONTINUE TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO DO SO. SECOND THE COMEDIAN ELSE TALKED A BIT ABOUT VEHICLE PRICING SO I'D LIKE TO JUST ADDRESS THAT ISSUE HEAD ON. CONSUMER PRICES ARE HIGH ACROSS THE BOARD RANGING FROM CONSUMER GOODS THAT YOU BUY AT TARGET. TO FOOD THAT YOU BUY AT THE GROCERY STORE SUPPLYING KATE SUPPLY CHAIN CONSTRAINTS IN INFLATIONARY FACTORS COUPLED WITH HIGH DEMAND FOR VEHICLES AND NOT ENOUGH INVENTORY. IS RESULTING IN HIGHER PRICES BUT VEHICLE PRICING LIKE THE PRICING OF OTHER CONSUMER GOODS IS CYCLICAL AND JUST BEFORE THE PANDEMIC VEHICLE PRICES WERE BELOW THE MSRP. FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE CONSUMERS PAID ABOUT TWENTY THREE HUNDRED IS BELOW THE MANUFACTURE TO. RETAIL PRICE ON AVERAGE WILL GO ON AGAIN. AIN'S CONSTANT AND WHAT IS A SEPARATE ISSUE FROM ICAL PRICING IS THE FACT THAT AUTO DEALERSHIP OBLIGATIONS CONTINUE TO INCREASE. AND THE DOCUMENT PROCESSING CHARGE HAS NOT KEPT PACE ALONG WITH IT. AND ALL OF AND BY JUST NOTING. THAT WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT VERY TO THE BILL IMPRINT WE'VE AGAIN REITERATE THE SENATOR'S COMMENTS WE SPOKE INTO THE CHARITY COMMITTEE. AND APPRECIATE AGAIN YOUR ENGAGEMENT LOOK FORWAD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON ANY REMAINING ISSUES AFTER COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU AND OUR NEXT WE HAVE MISTER BOB SMITH.

SEVEN ZERO OKAY SEVEN ZERO LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU CENTER ARCHULETA- NOW WILL MOVE ON TO YOUR NEXT BILL FILE ITEM SEVENTEEN SB TWELVE NINETY ONE. ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I AM PLEASED TO SUBMIT. TO YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION SENATE BILL TWELVE NINETY ONE WHICH WOULD DIRECT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADMINISTRATIVELY APPROVED HYDROGEN REFUELLING STATIONS. AS THEY DO CURRENTLY FOR CHARGING STATIONS AND OF COURSE THE- THE SPIRIT OF TODAY'S BEEN- TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE FUTURE AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CHARGES STATE. IN ORDER TO MEET OUR FUTURE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION GOALS INCLUDING THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE SALES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THE AVAILABILITY OF FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE MUST BE INCREASED AND IT MIGHT. AND I. COME BACK. INTO IS LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION WE KNOW CONSUMERS WILL NOT ADOPT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IF THE WRECKER SHOULD FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE TO INCLUDE ELECTRIC. TO THAT END SENATE BILL TWELVE NINETY ONE TO REACH A PATH TO EASE THE INITIAL PERMITTING PROCESS FOR HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS AND WELL THIS BILL PRESERVES LOCAL AUTHORITY TO DENY A PERMIT BASED ON SAFETY TO. PUBLIC HEALTH THE MEASURE READ. WILL GOVERNOR A GOVERNMENT AND OFFICIALS TO DISCLOSE CONCERNS AND OFFER SOLUTIONS UNDER THE ENERGY COMMISSION ACCOUNTABILITY- METRICS IT IS HYDROGEN IN THE HYDROGEN STATION PROGRAM THAT MUST BE ALLOWED TO SECURE PERMITS AND TO DO IT OPENLY. SO EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE PROCESS AND- THE ISSUES IT TAKES UP TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO COLLECT DATA AND EVENTUALLY GET A PERMIT IN TWENTY TWENTY WHEN THE JOINT CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND CALIFORNIA RESEARCHERS REPORT. REPORTED THAT GETTING A HUNDRED STATIONS SOMETIMES IT WOULD TAKE- WELL BEYOND FIVE HUNDRED DAYS SO AS I MENTIONED IT TAKES TOO LONG THIS WILL STREAMLINE THE PROCESS THE CITY ACCOUNT WILL STILL ADMINISTRATOR APPROVE OR DENY AN APPLICATION TO INSTALL ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS OR HYDROGEN FUEL STATIONS- THROUGH THE ISSUE ISSUANCE A BUILDING PERMIT. IT IS UP TO THE CITY COUNTY IT IS UP TO THEM IT IS LOCAL IN ADDITION A CITY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PERMITTING IF NECESSARY. SENATE BILL TWELVE NINETY ONE INCREASED PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT SACRIFICING LOCAL CONTROL WHILE ENSURING THAT ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS AND HYDROGEN FUEL STATIONS ARE BEING INSTALLED IN ORDER TO KEEP PACE WITH THE STATE'S GOAL OF INCREASING ELECTRIC. VEHICLE USAGE AND HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS WITH ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS THERESA COOK ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA I DO QUESTION AND FOR THE INFORMATION GIVEN YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IBOOK THANK YOU CENTER CHILL AT A MISS COOK WELCOME THANK YOU SENATOR SB TWELVE NINETY ONE IS A MODEST BERGER TERESA COOK ON BEHALF OF HEALTH AND. ACTOR KEUCHEL'S REST ASSURED THIS BILL DOES NOT ELIMINATE LOCAL CONTROL TO REQUIRED DISCRETIONARY PERMIT BUT SENDS A CLEAR SIGNAL TO CITIES AND COUNTIES TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP ADEQUATE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS THE BIGGEST BARRIER TO CONSUMER ADOPTION WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONSOR THIS MEASURE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I.

HI JOHN MICHAEL PARTON REPRESENTING OVER A DOZEN WRITERS PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORS PROBLEMS HOLDEN STRONG SUPPORT SB TWELVE NINETY ONE. THANK YOU THERE ARE NO FURTHER LINE TO SUPPORT PLEASE CONTINUE MANAGER THANK YOU MODERATOR SO NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO OPPOSITION WE DO NOT HAVE ANY REGISTERED OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME SO AND IN THE GALLERY IN OPPOSITION TO SB TWELVE NINETY ONE PLACE. HI LINDA HUTCHINS KNOWLES ON BEHALF OF A TERRA. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE WE SEE THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS MOVED DECISIVELY IN FAVOR OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY. AND NOT FOR HYDROGEN FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES. THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY BATTERY ELECTRIC. ARE MUCH SUPERIOR TO FUEL VEHICLES FIRST THEY ARE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT. ALSO 95% OF THE HYDROGEN CURRENTLY USED IN FUEL CELL VEHICLES COMES FROM FOSSIL FUEL SOURCES THIS IS A COUNTRY TO OUR CLIMATE GOALS. SECOND BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE MUCH MORE ECONOMICAL FOR DRIVERS. THE COST FOUR TIMES AS MUCH TO FUEL AND FCV BE LIKE A TOYOTA MIRAI MIRAI THAN A BATTLE TO VEHICLE LIKE A TESLA MODEL S. AND THIRD DRIVING BEVS ARE MUCH MORE PRACTICAL THAN FC VIS. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY FORTY FOUR HYDROGEN FUEL STATIONS IN CALIFORNIA I KNOW THIS BILL IS TRYING TO PUT IT MORE BUT EACH ONE COST ONE TO TWO MILLION DOLLARS. WE COULD INSTALL. VEHICLE CHARGERS FOR EVERY HYDROGEN FUEL PUMP THEY BUILD. THEIR ALSO DEEMED OF COMPLETED CONCERNS OF HYDROGEN FILLING STATIONS IT MAKES NO ECONOMIC SENSE TO SPEND MILLIONS MORE FOR HYDROGEN FUEL PUMPS WHICH WILL BE USED BY A FEW IN UP AT. THE CONVENIENCE OF HOME. GIVEN THE DOMINANCE OF BIOCEUTICALS OVER FUEL CELL VEHICLES IN THIS OF LATE TO THE MARKET. AND THE CLEAR CLIMATE ECONOMIC INCONVENIENCE ADVANTAGES OF BATHS THE STATE SHOULD NOT INVEST MORE MONEY IN BUILDING OUT HYDROGEN FILLING STATIONS. WE SHOULD INSTEAD FOCUS ON EXPORTING ACCELERATE EQUITABLE OPTION ABOUT ELECTRIC VEHICLES SO WE EXPRESS OUR CONCERN WITH THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL TAKE THAT AS LEAD. WITNESS IN OPPOSITION SO ANYONE ELSE IN THE GALLERY WHO WOULD LIKE TO OPPOSE BETWEEN NINETY PLACE. CORM GUY HOLE IN THE- NATIONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE ASSOCIATION. SUPPORTS USE OF FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY IN THE HEAVY DUTY IN MARINA SPACE BUT THE- BELIEVE IT'S INAPPROPRIATE IN THE LEAD TO THE- SPACE AND- AND THEY'RE CONSTANTLY- OPPOSES. THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SB TWELVE NINETY ONE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. TO THE BILL. OKAY SEE NONE WILL MOVE TO THE TELECONFERENCE LINE FOR ANYONE ELSE WHO'D LIKE TO OPPOSE SB TWELVE NINETY ONE PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB TWELVE NINETY ONE THIS PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE'LL GO TO LINE ONE SEVENTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO THIS IS OFTEN LONG GREEN GRANT WHILE THE RIVAL. AND I PULLED THE BILL- FOR REASONS OF. DATA BEFORE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS SO EXPENSIVE IT WILL NEVER GET IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND WE NEED AFFORDABILITY THANK YOU. I'M GOING TO LIVE TO SEVENTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. I TWO SEVENTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. WE'LL GO TO LINE ONE OH TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. LOOKING EVERY I CAN HEAR YOU. YEAH DEREK JOHNSON THE MANAGER OF POLICY AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS THERE ARE- REITERATING OUR ORGANIZATION'S CONCERN OPPOSITION WITH THIS BILL. THERE ARE NO FURTHER LINES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE CONTINUE OKAY THANK YOU WE'VE CONCLUDED SUPPORT OPPOSITION WILL TAKE IT BACK TO THE DAYS ANY MEMBERS HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR CONCERNS QUESTIONS SB TWELVE NINETY ONE. EIGHT C. NINE WELL I AM A SENATOR ARCHULETA. I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR- WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND I THINK YOU'RE OR SUPPORTERS AS WELL FOR SITTING DOWN WITH ME. I STILL DIES DO HAVE CONCERNS AND I KNOW THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH LOCALS AND CONTINUE TO WORK- TO ADDRESS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHICH I THINK IS BEEN BROUGHT UP WHICH IS SAFETY CONCERNS NO FOR THE COMMUNITIES. SHOULD THEY COME UP OUT OF THIS YOU KNOW IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD. BUT- WILL HAVE TO COULD YOU JUST SING THAT LOOK FOR THAT AND YOU KNOW THE AS IS ONGOING CONVERSATION OF ZERO EMISSION FUTURE WHAT THIS WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE- I KNOW- WE'VE GOT A LOT TO DISCUSS AS IT PERTAINS TO THESE YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S BATTERY ELECTRIC OR LIGHT DUTY. HYDROGEN I THINK. I'M NEED TO ENSURE THAT PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OF THEM AND SEEING WHO CAN GET TO THE TO THE- TO THE I GUESS THE FINISH LINE FASTEST BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY FIRST AND ENSURING THAT WERE AND REDUCING EMISSIONS ESPECIALLY FOR THESE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT THE MOST SO WITH THAT WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON SB TWELVE NINETY ONE. SENATOR CORTESE- MISTER CHIEF CONSULTANT WILL CALL THE ROLL AND WILL ASK MISTER- ARE TO LET IT TO ALSO- CLOSE PLEASE. REFER CLOSING IN YES MEDICARE AND BY THE WAY THE- A RESOURCE BOARD SAYS THAT- HYDROGEN FUEL STATIONS ARE 92% RENEWABLE. BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE A MANAGING A TREASURE CHEST OF ENERGY AND WE HAVE TO USE THAT AND OPEN THAT TREASURE CHEST TO ALLOW EVERYTHING FOR THE FUTURE WE JUST CAN'T GO ELECTRIC WE JUST CAN'T GO ONE WE'VE GOT INCLUDED ALL. IN RIGHT NOW REMEMBER WHAT I'D MENTION EACH CITY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE THAT MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT THEY DO IT'S SAFE IT'S PROPER IT'S WITH. SIDE LINES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- YES INDEED WE HAVE FORTY TO FIFTY- FUELING STATIONS WE'RE LOOKING FOR A HUNDRED WE'RE LOOKING FOR GOD ALMIGHTY A THOUSAND WHATEVER IT'S GOING TO TAKE. TO GIVE THE GENERAL PUBLIC THE OPTION TO GO WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLES FUEL CELL ELECTRIC BATTERY VEHICLES BUT WHATEVER IT IS WE'VE GOT INCLUDED ALL AND WE HEARD THAT- HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES- THEY REALLY THRIVE WELL. WITH YOURSELF- HYDROGEN BATTERIES CHAU FROM THE PORCH OF LONG BEACH YOU'RE SICK WE KNOW THAT IF WE INCORPORATE FUEL CELL A HYBRID BATTERIES THAT'S GONNA ALL ALSO OPEN THE DOOR FOR- ZERO ADMISSIONS AND SO ON. SO WITH ISSUE WITH. THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS TO STREAMLINE THE OPPORTUNE TO GIVE SO. SELF TO. ALLOW NEW ERA INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT TOO IT IS SO WITH THAT I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER ARCHULETA I'M WE HAVE A AGAIN THE MOTION BY SENATOR CORTESE MISTER CHIEF CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATORS GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ I BATES. ALAN ARCHULETA ARCHULETA I BAKER. CORTESE CORTESE I. DALI DOT DOT AYE LIMÓN MON I MCGUIRE MELENDEZ MEN NEWMAN. RUBIO RUBIO HIGH SKINNER WHY CASKEY WILK. SIX ZERO. THE LONG CALL THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR TO LET UP SO NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO- FILE ITEM MOVE UP TO FILE ITEM FIFTEEN BY SEN THE MOM THAT IS S. B. TWELVE THIRTY. THANK YOU KAREN SENATORS. SB TWELVE THIRTY WILL STREAMLINE THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS CALIFORNIA HAS TO INCENTIVIZE CONSUMERS TO SWITCH TO LOWER EMISSION VEHICLES WHILE MAKING THEM MORE ACCESSIBLE TO CONSUMERS. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE STATE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM. REQUIRES CARP TO CREATE A SINGLE UNIFIED APPLICATION AND EDUCATION PORTAL. AND OPENS UP MORE OF THESE PROGRAMS TO ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION LIKE E. BIKES OR PUBLIC TRANSIT. IF THAT WORKS BETTE FOR THE CONSUMER. IT DEFINITELY THERE CAN ALSO BE A LONG WAITING PERIOD BETWEEN A PERSON BUT BETWEEN THE TIME A PERSON APPLIES TO ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS AND WHEN THEY RECEIVE THE INCENTIVE. UNFORTUNATELY MANY PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD. MONTHS NEW VEHICLE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS PROCESS IS NOT A BIG. GETTING ELECTRIC VEHICLE. WANT TO MAKE IS PROGRAMS. SAYS TO LOOK HELLO. I'M NOT. GETTING TO BE ABLE TO REQUIRE FOR ANY OF THE- JUST MAKING EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS AND USE. AT TODAY WITH US WE HAVE BENJAMIN I KERR THE DIRECTOR OF LET'S GO. LET'S GREEN CALIFORNIA AND- CAMILLE TRAVIS. MILLER TRAVIS FROM THE EGGS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DOLLARS WHAT THE FOUNDATION SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR LIMON WE HAVE BENJAMIN I COURTS ON THE COASTLINE FROM LET'S GREEN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE GONZALEZ MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS BENJAMIN I KERR I'M THE DIRECTOR OF FOR AMERICANS TO DUPLICATE CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE. WORK CRAP THE SPONSORS MESTI TWELVE THIRTY. FIRST ONE EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE. CENTER LIMÓN FOR OFFERING THIS BILL INTO THIS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR HARD. WORK ON TRANSPORTATION ISSUES YOU KNOW EMISSIONS FROM CARS AND TRUCKS. AFTER DECADES MORNING CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS. WITHIN SAFE AND HEALTHY AIR QUALITY. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OUR ORGANIZATION HAS CONDUCTED OUTREACH AND EDUCATION. IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO HELP INDIVIDUALS. GET INTO CLEAN CARS WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS STRONG. TO SUPPORT THEIR OWN MISSION BE. NEWS PER HAVE DONE A LOT OF THE- INSTEAD PLAN IT IS UNFORTUNATE DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE. THERE ARE MYRIAD PROGRAMS EACH WITH ITS OWN APPLICATION IN ITS OWN TIME FOR APPROVAL AND USE. IN PRACTICE THESE PROGRAMS DON'T MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR RESIDENTS BECAUSE A YOU DON'T HAVE THE EXPENDABLE INCOME TO BUY. NOW RECEIVE A REBATE LATER AND BE THEY TEND TO DRIVE YOUR CURRENT VEHICLE UNTIL IT BREAKS DOWN WHICH MANS WAITING PERIODS ARE A PROBLEM BECAUSE WHEN THEY NEED A NEW VEHICLE. THAT NEEDED URGENT BY SIMPLIFYING AND STREAMLINING ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INCENTIVES UNDER A ONE STOP SHOP BUT MAKING THOSE FUNDS AVAILABLE AT POINT OF SALE. SB THIRTY GAMES TO ENSURE THESE PROGRAMS. THAT ARE SERVICE WHO. WE FOUND A BLACK ACTOR TO PUBLIC. IN DISADVANTAGED. CREATE THAT. BARRIER WITH OPTION. AT THE DISCO A LOCKET THAT. INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT BLACK HI THE MAN THIS DYNAMIC BEFORE. THE SECOND PART OF SB TWELVE THIRTY ABOUT THE TEMPLATE WHICH CURRENTLY. AIMS TO ACCELERATE THE BUILD OUT OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ENSURE THAT THAT INVESTMENT EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE. CONCLUSION SB TWELVE THIRTY CAN HELP ENSURE IS WE PURSUE OUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. WORKING FAMILIES AND FROM MY COMMUNITIES FOR FRONT OF THAT TRANSITION. I BEING ABLE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES THE STATE FINANCE SUPPORT. ISSUE ONLY COMBINED WITH THE WORKFORCE STANDARDS ALREADY IN PLACE. ASSEMBLY DEFEAT FORTY ONE CAN CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBS. AND GROWTH SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE CALIFORNIA WILL NEED WELL INTO THE FUTURE. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I BONUS TO TWELVE THIRTY AND I THINK THIS. COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MISTER I. AYE NEXT ONE MOVE ON TO KAMALA CHAVEZ DIVORCE THE FOUNDING. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT THE LETTER FOR FUNDING. DIFFICULT THE THEIR SENATE BILL TWELVE THIRTY THAT'S A LOT DIFFERENT THE FOUNDATION IS A FINTECH PURCELL'S AND ACTIVELY WORKED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY. NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THE EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY CURRENTLY HAVE THREE LEVELS OF OZONE AND FUND BUDGET ARTICULATE. THIS IS ACCORDING TO MONITORING DONE BY THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD THESE TOXIC AIR POLLUTANTS ARE PRODUCED FROM THE TAIL PIPE. OF TWENTY NINE MILLION CARTONS. IN OUR STATE. THE TORREY ILLNESS DEVELOPMENT AND THEN HEALTH ISSUES HARPER AND SHORTEN MY AND SIX CHILDREN AND THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAVE AT. THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN THE STATE THIS IS AN INTERGENERATIONAL INJUSTICE SUFFERED PREDOMINATELY BY LOW INCOME AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. CELEBRATING CLEAN CAR CHEN AND HISTORICALLY OVERLOOKED AREAS WILL HAVE TREMENDOUS IMPACT ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION A RAPID CLEAN CAR TRANSITION WHAT PREVENT MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND PREMATURE DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE COMING DECADE WITH MOST OF THE BENEFITS GOING TO LOW INCOME AND HIS. OKAY HOLD ON A MOBILE AND MAY COSTS ARE STRIVE TO IMPROVE THE LIFE UNDER THE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE BELIEVE SB TWELVE THIRTY WILL MEANINGFULLY REDUCED HEALTH AND ECONOMIC BURDEN ARE COMMUNITIES EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY AND PUT THE STATE ON A BETTER PATH MEETING OUR CLIMATE AND CLEAN AIR GOALS WE THANK SENATE REALLY MON AND THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE.

REVENUE MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AS YOU CAN SEE I'VE GOT A BAD BACK AND I'M WALKING SLOWLY AS POSSIBLE CORNERS MUCH SYMPATHY AS POSSIBLE. HOPEFULLY IT WORKED IT AGAIN IF ANYBODY WANTS TO DO VERY COOL WHAT YES- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I AM HERE BEFORE YOU DID ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE. A WHICH AS AMENDED IN SENATE ENERGY WILL PROVIDE FUNDING THROUGH THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM TO EXPEDITE. THE BUILD OUT OF A STATE WIDE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN EQUITY FOCUSED FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE HYGIENE FUELING NETWORK FOR CALIFORNIA. C. E. C. FUNDING WOULD BE BASED ON ASSESSMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE NEED IS IDENTIFIED. FOURNIR RESOURCE. WITH THE OVERALL GOAL OF REACHING SELF SUFFICIENCY AS DEFINED BY COURT AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE. AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE CALIFORNIA HAS NOW FULLY COMMITTED TO THE AMBITIOUS GOAL OF MOVING BEYOND GASOLINE POWERED AUTOMOBILES BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. RESEARCH ON BY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD AND THE- IN CASE THAT. CALIFORNIA'S CURRENTLY MORE THAN THIRTY MILLION VEHICLES AT A PACE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE STATE'S TWENTY THIRTY FIVE GOALS RELYING EXCLUSIVELY ON BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES ALONE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO GET US THERE WHILE BATTERY ELECTRIC CARS ARE WONDERFUL AND STEADILY GAINING IN BOTH PROMISE AND MARKET SHARE THEY ARE UNFORTUNATELY NOT NECESSARILY GOOD FOR EVERYONE- NOR APPEALING TO EVERYBODY PARTICULAR APARTMENT WHILE SHE MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE- THOSE ARE SOME OF THE RULES THAT THAT WE HAVE ADDRESS TODAY. THAT COMMUTERS DRIVE LONG DISTANCES ARE DELIVERY DRIVERS ARE RIGHT YOUR WORKERS WHO DON'T HAVE TIME TO LOOK FOR A BATTERY TO REACH. CORROBORATING EVIDENCE A SURVEY CONDUCTED LAST YEAR BY THE UC DAVIS INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION. FOUND THAT ROUGHLY A FIFTH OF THE FIFTH OF OWNERS OF BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES DECIDE TO SWITCH BACK. TO GASOLINE POWERED CAR ENGINES. WHEN BUYING THEIR NEXT COURT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. IF IT'S TRUE THEN THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO MEET EITHER OUR INTERIM OR ULTIMATE GOALS AROUND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE ADOPTION THROUGH BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES ALONE. WE NEED TO CONSIDER HOW BEST TO ENABLE THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ONLY OTHER COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ZERO EMISSIONS AUTOMOBILE TECHNOLOGY. THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR FCEV PLATFORM. AS A MATTER OF POLICY CALIFORNIA SUPPORT FOR INVESTMENTS IN ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPOSED TO BE NEUTRAL. AND NOT ADOPT ANYONE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE FUEL OR TECHNOLOGY. POLICY HOWEVER IS NOT ALWAYS FULLY TRANSLATED INTO PRACTICE TO DATE ESPECIALLY IN RECENT YEARS. PUBLIC INVESTMENTS ARE PRIORITIZED THE BUILD OUT OF BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. TO THE DETRIMENT OF HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS NOT ENJOYED A CORRESPONDENT LEVEL OF SUPPORT. TO THAT POINT CALIFORNIA'S URRENTLY ALLOCATING LESS THAN 5% OF TOTAL FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING. TOWARD THE BUILD OUT OF THE PLAN STATEWIDE HYDROGEN FUELING STATION NETWORK- PASSENGER VEHICLES AND MEDIUM. DUTY TRUCKS THE ABSENCE OF A COMPLETE SUFFICIENTLY DISTRIBUTED STATEWIDE HYDROGEN FUEL WOULD FUELING NETWORK REPRESENTS A PRIMARY BARRIER TO THE MARKET VIABILITY AND WIDESPREAD CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. OF A VERY PROMISING CLASS OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IT ALSO SENDS A POWERFUL NEGATIVE SIGNAL. TO AUTOMAKERS CURRENTLY OFFERING ARE CONSIDERING OFFERING NON POLLUTING ZERO CARBON FUEL EFFICIENT AND AFFORDABLE FCEV IN THE CALIFORNIA AUTOMOBILE MARKET. FURTHER HI JUNE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING IS PARTICULAR SMART IN FISCAL FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE RIGHT NOW AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE CALIFORNIA WILL BE SUBMITTING A BID FOR ONE OF THE UP TO FOR HYGIENE HOW GRANTS. OUT OF AN EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION WITHIN THE RECENTLY PASSED FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT NOT ONLY ARE EARLY INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA'S NETWORK OF LIGHT DUTY HARJIT STATIONS ONE OF OUR BEST SELLING POINTS FOR OUR BIDS. THE INVESTMENTS WE ARE SEEKING TODAY WILL COUNT AS MATCH FUNDS FOR ANY FEDERAL HYDROGEN HUB WARD. FURTHER FUNNY TO EXPEDITE HODGES STATION BILL THAT WILL ENSURE THAT HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS ARE WITHIN A USEFUL RADIUS OF JUST. HOME B. E. V. SENSE. TO COMMUTE DISTANCES WORK PATTERNS HOUSING DENSITY OR LACK OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE SB THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE WILL ENSURE THAT HYDROGEN AND ITS C. E. THESE ARE PART. OF CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE SOLUTIONS THEREBY PLACING OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS SOUNDLY WITHIN REACH WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE. THE STATE WILL BE ALLOCATING APPROPRIATE FUNDING TO ACCELERATE THE BUILD OUT. OF A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE HARSH AND FUELING NETWORK BEYOND TWO HUNDRED STATIONS MOVING TOWARD A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FUELING NETWORK THAT MEETS THE SELF SUFFICIENTLY THRESH. SELF SUFFICIENCY THRESHOLD AS LAID OUT IN THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN AB EIGHT REPORT. HYDROGEN IS NOT ONLY A VIABLE AND ULTIMATELY PROMISING FUEL OPTION FOR ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES. IT'S A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF ANY REALISTIC AND EFFECTIVE PLAN THAT WILL ENABLE CALIFORNIA. TO MEET ITS OVERALL ZERO EMISSIONS GOALS IMPORTANTLY SB THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE ALSO PROVIDES AT LEAST 60% OF THE FUNDING SHALL BE USED FOR PROJECTS. THAT COMPLETELY OR PARTIALLY BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AS THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION SOMERCOTES AND FIRMLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AND OTHERS TO FIND THE BEST A POSSIBLE APPROACH. AND REVENUE SOURCES FOR THIS CRITICAL ZERO EMISSION TRANSPORTATION INITIATIVE FOR THESE REASONS I HOPE SUPPORT THE- HEY I RESPECTFULLY ASKING. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. DIVIDE OUR TRIP. IN THE EXACT ADDRESS OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING COALITION AND BY PHONE TO JACK BRAUER THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL FUEL CELL RESEARCH CENTER AT UC IRVINE. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT- YOU TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS ADDED A REQUIREMENT TO ADD EASY FUNDING BASED ON NEED AS WELL THAT IS CORRECT MA'AM BATES THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR- COMMENTS- WILL START WITH. TO RESET COOK- WHO'S HERE IN THE GALLERY. RIGHT NOW- FROM THE HYDROGEN CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION THANK YOU CHAIR SB THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE IS INTENDED TO RIGHT A WRONG IN THE FINANCING DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN CHARGING AND HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE. OR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ARE CLEAR BUT EXECUTING ON THESE GOALS BY GETTING DRIVERS TO MAKE THE SWITCH IS OUR COLLECTIVE CHALLENGE. AS NOTED BY DR BROWER WHO'S GOING TO TESTIFY NEXT. FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES BUILT BY OUR TOP AUTO MANUFACTURERS TOYOTA HONDA AND HYUNDAI AMONG OTHERS ARE WELL SUITED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE LIVING IN MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS. WITHOUT GARAGES AND PREDICTABLE ACCESS TO CHARGING AND ARE SUPER COMMUTERS THAT HAVE REACHED WELL OVER HALF A MILLION INSIDE IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. DESPITE THESE ADVANTAGES LESS THAN THREE POINT BILLION DOLLARS. IN STATE FUNDING BEING DIRECTED TOWARDS ZERO EMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TOWARD HYDROGEN. I JUST. HEARD THAT THE PER. BOSS OF HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE OUR COMPATIBLE TO CHARGING IN ONE OF THE UNIQUE THINGS ABOUT HYDROGEN AS THAT WE ARE ON A PATHWAY TO SELF SUFFICIENCY. THERE RESOURCES BOARD FOUND WITH AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED MILLION WE WOULD HAVE A FULLY FUNCTIONING LIGHT DUTY AND MEDIUM DUTY. HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK SO THIS IS KIND OF AN EXAMPLE OF AN EMERGING GREEN TECHNOLOGY THAT IS ABLE TO STAND ON ITS OWN AND NO LONGER NEED SUBSIDY. SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE YET TO FIND WITH A LOT OF OUR OTHER COMPUTING AND TECHNOLOGY SO SOMETHING WE'RE VERY EXCITED OF MARIE VERY PROUD OF. I'M REALLY WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS SUPPORT AND HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS I'VE YOU KNOW THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE WILL ENSURE EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA. HAS THE ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSITION IT WAS YOUR MISSION VEHICLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS COOK NOW WILL- KICK IT TO THE TELECONFERENCE LINE MISTER JACK BRAUER NATIONAL FUEL CELL RESEARCH CENTER PLEASE. HI JACK BAUER HERE THANK YOU CARE GONZALEZ AN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND THANK YOU CENTER NEWMAN FOR LEADING TO. THE- THE DEVELOPMENT IT'S IMPORTANT BUDGET LEGISLATION. OR THEIR OWN MISSION TRANSPORTATION IN CALIFORNIA. I AM A PROFESSOR OF MECHANICAL AND AEROSPACE ENGINEERING HERE AT UC IRVINE AND THAT OUR ANALYSES. OF ZERO EMISSIONS TRANSPORTATION AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT SUCH. SHOWS THAT WE WILL NEED TO INVEST IN BOTH. ELECTRIC VEHICLES STARTING IN IN HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE. AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST. AND WHILE HYDROGEN HAS DISTINCT ADVANTAGES OVER BATTERY ESPECIALLY IN HEAVY DUTY APPLICATIONS. YOU DO IT PASSED THE FUELING LONG RANGE OF HEAVY PAYLOAD CAPABILITY. HYDROGEN WILL ALSO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REDUCING TO ZERO EMISSIONS IN THE LIKE THE ACTOR. MOST IMPORTANTLY. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT WE TALK ABOUT ALMOST ALL. ACTION HERE. EARLY LIMON RENTAL PROPERTY AND NOT EASILY GARNER AT. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES OUT HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH SMALL NUMBERS OF FUELING STATIONS IN DENSE URBAN ENVIRONMENT AND NEAR RENTAL PROPERTIES AND- THOUSANDS OF RENTAL PROPERTIES WHEN ACT THE FEDERAL. CHARGING AT THE MOMENT. I PROJECT WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO SERVE A PORTION OF THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE THROUGH OUT THE STATE WHEN THE OPTION OF THAT BECOME VERY LARGE THAT IS. AT WORK IS A HUNDRED PERCENT. BECAUSE NEIGHBORHOOD ELECTRIC CIRCUIT. THROUGHOUT THE STATE CAN HANDLE THEM AND INSPIRATION HERE IF YOU'RE SIXTY PERCENT. BUT CANNOT ACCOMMODATE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT STARTING WITHOUT A VERY LARGE INVESTMENT BETWEEN THE FUELING OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY CREDIT APPLICATION AND LIKE THE FEELING WHICH WHEN COMBINED HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE COST OF HYDROGEN FOR CONSUMER. I WANT TO END WITH THIS STATEMENT WE MUST URGENTLY ENABLE THAT HAVE ADOPTION ESPECIALLY IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHERE EXPOSURE TO POLLUTION. IS LEADING THE BEER AND IRREPARABLE HEALTH IMPACT.

PLEASE COME FORWARD. HI I'M LINDA HUTCHINS KNOWLES ON BEHALF OF ACTOR ACTION FOR A HEALTHY CLIMATE WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO SB THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE. WE URGE ALL OF YOU TO PLEASE QUESTION THE HYDROGEN HYPE. IT'S A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM. YES THEY MAY BE ZERO EMISSIONS AT THE PLACE OF THE CAR BUT CONSIDER WHERE THE HYDROGEN IS BEING PRODUCED BY BY FOSSIL FUELS YOUR DISPLACING THE POLLUTION TO FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THIS IS AN EQUITABLE IN THE CLIMATE INJUSTICE. BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE MUCH LESS CARBON INTENSIVE AND FAR MORE EFFICIENT AS A SOURCE OF LIGHT VEHICLE POWER. THESE COMPANIES ARE ATTEMPTING TO GREEN WASH THEIR HYDROGEN WITHOUT CONSIDERING ITS CARBON INTENSITY. THAT SHOULD BE THE SOLE METRIC BY WHICH THE GREEN CREDENTIALS OF HYDROGEN ARE JUDGED. SECOND HYDROGEN NEEDS TO BE STORED AND TRANSPORTED EITHER AS A HIGH PRESSURE GAS OR THE CRYOGENIC LIQUID MAKING IT MUCH MORE HAZARDOUS TO HANDLE. PLEASE DO NOT PUT THESE FUELING STATIONS IN IT POPULATION CENTERS THIS IS A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN. BECAUSE HYDROGEN MOLECULES ARE SO MUCH FOR THE NATURAL GAS METHANE. THEY ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR HYDROGEN BOTH THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR NATURAL GAS AS I PREFER HATER CHEN SO DIFFERENT MORE EXPENSIVE AND MORE THE CLOSEST INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED FOR HYDROGEN. AS WE KNOW CHART. BECAUSE CAN BE CITED ANYWHERE SAFELY ON THE ELECTRIC GRID. THEY ARE AN ECONOMICAL SAFE AND WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ALREADY EXISTS WEST NO SUCH NETWORK EXIST FOR HYDROGEN WE DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR EXPENSIVE DISTRACTIONS LIKE HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY. ONLY GREEN TECHNOLOGY IN HYDROGEN IS TRULY GREEN AND THAT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE SO PLEASE TAKE THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT PROPOSED IN THIS AND PUT IT INSTEAD INTO THE BAD CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR SUPPORTING THE COSTS FOR BUILDERS TO PUT. UP CHARGING INTO MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. MULTI FAMILY HOUSING RESIDENTS WANT TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE AT HOME WHERE IT'S MOST CONVENIENT MOST SAFE AND MORE SUPPORTABLE SO PLEASE QUESTION THE HYDROGEN HYPE. VOTING THIS OF. THE BOAT THANK THAT MOTHERS LIKE ME WORK INTERRUPTIONS PRESSURE WITH THE QUEUE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO TAKE THAT AS LEAD OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME ANYONE ELSE IN THE GALLERY WHO WOULD LIKE TO OPPOSE S. B. AT. THIRTEEN TWENTY NINE PLEASE COME FORWARD. SOME GUY HOLD FINANCIAL LOGIC ALTHOUGH BERMAN THE MEASURE ELECTRIC VEHICLE ASSOCIATION- BELIEVE THAT THERE'S GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUEL CELLS AND HYDROGEN.

THANK YOU MODERATOR SO IT'S CONCLUDED SUPPORT NOT XIN WE'VE GOT A QUESTION OR COMMENT BY SENATOR MEN- YEAH. AUTHORED THIS BILL. ACTUALLY I HAVE A TOYOTA MIRAI AND I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO EITHER THE MAIN BARRIER TO OWNING THESE THINGS NOT BRING THEM IS THE LACK OF FUELING STATIONS- AND WHILE I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT ELECTRIC MAY BE OUR SALVATION I THINK. IF WE WANT TO TRULY ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS WE HAVE TO BE A GNOSTIC IN THE INNOVATION THAT WE CHOSE CHOOSE TO PROMOTE. WE ADDRESS BY ALL ACCOUNTS HAS GREAT PROMISE I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING UC IRVINE AND TALKING DIRECTLY DOCTOR JACK BRAUER AND I KNOW THAT- THERE'S REAL CONCERN ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF LITHIUM AND COBALT OUT THERE. ON THIS PLANET WITH IT'S ENOUGH TO MEET OUR BATTERY NEEDS- ACROSS THE ROAD OUR STORAGE NEEDS AYE I THINK HYDROGEN HAS GREAT PROMISE- WE BUT IF WE WANT TO PROMOTE THAT WOULD. GRATION OF SUBSIDIES TO LECTURE. AND BATTERIES I THINK. A SMALL SUBSIDY HERE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO PROMOTE A SERIES OF HYDROGEN CHARGING STATIONS AROUND THE STATE. TO TRY TO PROMOTE PICK UP HERE. I THINK IS A VERY WISE INVESTMENT AND IT'S JUST CLASSIC PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT WE CANNOT PUT ALL OUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET AS WE'RE TRYING TO FIGHT THE CLIMATE CRISIS SO. AGAIN PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR THIS BILL WOULD LOOK TO MOVE THE BUILT IT. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND- YOU KNOW STRONGLY. I'VE OPENED MY COLLEAGUES. Q. ORDER SENATE SENATOR ARE TO LET AND THEN BACKED SENATOR CRITIC YOU INTERFERE. I AM SO PROUD OF THIS BILL I THINK IT BRINGS US FULL CIRCLE- WITH THE BILLS THAT I'VE- PUT ON THE TABLE WITH YOURS.

THEY'VE HAD NO PROBLEMS- WE HAVE THE GENERAL PUBLIC NOW IS ABLE TO GO TO THAT FUELING STATION- I KNOW THE INDUSTRY IS STARTING TO GROW. AND SAFETY IS ALWAYS NUMBER ONE. AND I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT. THAT WITH THE VETTING PROCESS AND EACH AND EVERY CITY. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE GOING TO SEE. THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL BATTERIES AS PART OF THE EVOLUTION OF. TAKING CARE OF OUR ENVIRONMENT HITTING THAT GERALD MISSION. SO I AM BE PROUD TO BE AN OFF CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL AS WELL. AND WITH THAT I WILL GO AHEAD AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATE ARCHULETA SENATOR CORTESE. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME IT WILL BE BRIEF BUT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE- THE CONCERNS OF- THE OPPOSITION IN IT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE- SOME OF THAT IS I KNOW- SORT OF COMING FROM MY OWN COUNTY GEOGRAPHICALLY SPEAKING- BUT- IN THIS INTERESTING HAVE BEEN A COUNTY SUPERVISOR THERE THAT. THERE'S BEEN SOME SIGNIFICANT. JIM BY THE COUNTY IN TERMS OF CRAZY STATIONS FOR FLEET AND SO FORTH BUT I JUST WANT TO SEE REGARDLESS OF THE ONGOING DEBATE ABOUT WHAT'S- BEST. I THINK THE AMENDMENTS REALLY CREATE A SITUATION VERY CLEARLY- THE THAT IS GOING TO BE BASED ON NEED AND ANALYSIS BY THE AGENCIES IT IT'S NOT.
