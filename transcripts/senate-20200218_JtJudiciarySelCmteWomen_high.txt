THE SELECT THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON WOMEN WORK AND FAMILIES CO SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS THE TITLE OF THIS HEARING IS THE PINK TAX. HOW GENDER BASED PRICING DISCRIMINATION UNDERMINES WOMEN'S ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. I WANT TO WELCOME YOU ALL IN MY COLLEAGUES IN THE DíAS AS WELL I'M GRATEFUL TO THOSE OF YOU HERE IN THE AUDIENCE AND THOSE OF YOU ON THE DíAS ATTENDING- THIS IS AS I MENTIONED A JOINT HEARING AND THERE WILL BE I THINK PEOPLE JOINING US ON LINE. WHICH IS. KIND OF HARD FOR ALL FOLKS LIKE ME WERE USED TO COUNTING HEADS- BUT- I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT THERE. ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT THERE- WHO ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE AND ONE WELCOME THEM AS WELL- OUR FIRST WITNESS THE HONORABLE CONGRESSWOMAN JACKIE SPEAR HAS I KNOW A FLIGHT COMING UP WITH AND A HARD STOP IN. A BIT- BUT I AM DELIGHTED THAT SHE HAS AGREED TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO SHARE WITH US SHE SORT OF THE- MOTHER OF. EQUALITY IN. A GENDER PRICING HAVING. SERVED IN THIS BODY HE FOR MANY YEARS AND HAVING BROUGHT THE FIRST BILL. TO BAN DISCRIMINATION IN THE BASIS ON THE BASIS OF GENDER FOR SERVICES. AND THAT WAS I THINK IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR- SO FAST FORWARD HERE WE ARE TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER SHE LOOKS NO DIFFERENT AND I'M VERY JEALOUS BUT- WE HAVEN'T REALLY MOVED TO AS FAR. BEYOND THAT LEVEL OF DISCRIMINATION AS WE MUST AND SO WITH YOUR DAY TODAY TO TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO THIS ISSUE- IT'S- GENDER BASED PRICING DISCRIMINATION SOMETIMES CALLED THE PINK TAX I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THIS IS NOT A TAX COLLECTED BY GOVERNMENT THIS IS A TAX COLLECTED BY COMPANIES. TO ADD TO THEIR PROFIT MARGIN AT THE EXPENSE OF WOMEN AND FAMILIES IT'S A PRACTICE OF CHARGING HIGHER PRICES FOR GOODS AND SERVICES THAT ARE MARKETED TO WOMEN. WHEN THE SAME ESSENTIAL PRODUCT OR SERVICES ARE SOLD LESS A TWO MAN. SO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING OF CONCERN TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE OUT THERE IN THE MARKETPLACE- BUYING PRODUCTS FOR OURSELVES OR OUR CHILDREN. OR FAMILIES AND- BASICALLY JUST THE BOTTOM LINE IS NOT ONLY IS IT BAD ECONOMICALLY BUT IT'S WRONG JUST SIMPLY WRONG. AND IT SYSTEMATICALLY DEPRIVED WOMEN OF EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AND ALSO PSYCHOLOGICALLY A WASH WE'D BE PAYING MORE FOR RAZORS THAT ARE PINK THE MEN PAY FOR THE VERY SAME RAZOR THAT IS BLACK. OR SOME OTHER COLOR WHY SHOULD CHILDREN AS WE HAVE HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF TO TEDDY BEARS WE OF ALL INSPECTED THEM VERY CAREFULLY THEY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME. EXCEPT AS TO COLOR. THE PINK ONE IS TWO DOLLARS MORE THAN THE BLUE ONE. WHY IS THAT. THERE IS NO DECENT EXPLANATION FOR THAT COM IF THERE IS WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HEAR IT BUT THE EXPLANATION REALLY OBVIOUSLY IS MORE BASED UPON. THE PERCEPTION THAT WOMEN ARE PREPARED TO AND WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR A PRODUCT OF THAT IS MARKETED TO THEM IN IN A COLOR THAT WOMEN AND CHILDREN- GIRLS IN PARTICULAR TEND TO PREFER- SO WE ARE GOING TO LOOK INTO THIS. WE SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATING THE CIRCUMSTANCE WE DO HAVE WITNESSES WHO ARE GOING TO COME HOPEFULLY AND TELL US- THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE MANUFACTURERS POINT OF VIEW OR THE- DISTRIBUTOR THE RETAILERS POINT OF VIEW AND- I YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR. THAT PERSPECTIVE AS WELL. A WE'RE HERE WE A THE PIONEER AND TIRELESS WORKER ON THIS ISSUE CONGRESSWOMAN. JACKIE SPEAR- SHE WILL SHARE WITH US- THE- HISTORY LITTLE BIT OF THE HISTORY AND THEN SHE'S ALSO BRING A SIMILAR BILL. IN CONGRESS- SO THAT WE CAN- HOPEFULLY WORK TOGETHER CALIFORNIA COURSES BEEN IN THE LEAD IN A NUMBER OF GENDER. DISCRIMINATION LEGISLATION TO OFFSET THIS KIND OF UNACCEPTABLE- VIOLATIVE BEHAVIOR. AND LOOK FORWARD TO HER TESTIMONY SO WITHOUT FURTHER DO GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU DO HAVE. A TIME CONSTRAINTS WILL HEAR FROM A CONGRESSWOMAN SPEAR AND THEN OPEN IT UP FOR SOME QUESTIONS UNLESS ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT AT THIS TIME. THE THREE BODY OKAY GREAT. CONGRESSMAN SPEAR THE FLOOR IS YOURS MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO MY GOOD FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE SENATOR HILL- FOR HAVING THE BRILLIANCE TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF WOMEN AND FAMILIES- AND TO SERVE ON THIS COMMITTEE AND TO ALL THE OTHER MEMBERS IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE IT'S GREAT TO I FEEL LIKE I'M HOME AGAIN IT. SPENT EIGHTEEN YEARS OF MY LIFE HERE SO IT'S REALLY GREAT TO BE BACK MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP YOU'VE SHOWN A IN THIS ISSUE AREA AMONG MANY OTHERS THE BILL THAT YOU'VE INTRODUCED SB EIGHT FIFTY WHAT'S THE NUMBER. SEVEN EIGHT SEVENTY EIGHT SEVENTY THREE I NEED SOME HELP TO REMIND ME I'M NOT GOOD AT THE NUMBERS EITHER EIGHT SEVENTY THREE WHOLE HEARTEDLY ENDORSED AND ENCOURAGE THE PASSAGE OF A I HAVE A SIMILAR BILL ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL THIS REALLY GO BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY FOUR IT PASSABLE EVEN NINETY NINETY SIX BILL I CARRIED. TO DRAW ATTENTION FACT THAT SERVICES IN THE STATE WERE BEING BIASED NOT ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE BUT I WHETHER YOU MAY OR FEMALE. SO WE WENT OUT OF A BAY CAMPAIGN. TAKING WHITE OXFORD SHIRT. TO THE DRY CLEANER. EXACTLY THE SAME. THAT IF IT WAS A WOMAN SURE IT IT WAS TWO OR THREE DOLLARS MORE. TO LAUNDER THAN A MAN'S SHIRT- AGAIN- WITH HAIR RECENTLY YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF THE DUST UP THAT OCCURRED WHEN ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES SO I PAID EIGHTY DOLLARS FOR A HAIR CUT. AND SHE WAS MOCKED BY FORMER GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER WHO WENT IN AND SHOW THAT HE HAD PAID ONLY TWENTY SIX DOLLARS FOR THE HAIR CUT WELL- WHAT WE RECOGNIZE WAY BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES IS THAT WE SHOULD BE BASING THIS ON GENDER BUT ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES. TO LAUNDER A SHIRT OR CUT HAIR OR DO TAILORING SO THE BILL PASSED BECAME LAW. AND PROVIDES FOR PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. DURING THE COURSE OF THAT LEGISLATION I HAVE THE ASSEMBLY OFFICE OF RESEARCH. DO I A PROJECT TO EVALUATE HOW MUCH IS IT REALLY COSTING WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS NINETEEN. NINETY FOUR TO NINETEEN NINETY SIX- AND THEY CAME BACK WITH A FIGURE OF THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE DOLLARS MORE PER YEAR. FOR WOMEN JUST IN TERMS OF SERVICES THAT THEY WOULD- BE PAYING. AND YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE FACT THAT WOMEN ARE MAKING LESS. THAN MEN. THE WAGE GAP IS STILL ABOUT EIGHTY TWO CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR EARNED BY MEN IT'S MUCH WORSE FOR WOMEN OF COLOR- AND YOU IT COUPLE THOSE TWO TOGETHER AND IT'S JUST LIKE THE PERFECT STORM OF VIOLATION AT THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFAIRS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. DID A SURVEY OF PRODUCTS AND FOUND THAT ON AVERAGE WOMEN WERE PAYING- 13% MORE. NOW SO THEN I EMBARKED ON DOING THIS ON A FEDERAL LEVEL AND LAST SUMMER MICE STUDENT INTERNS ALL WERE CHARGED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOING ONLINE. AND LOOKING AT GOODS. THAT WERE REFERENCES BOY GIRL MAN WOMAN AND LOOK AT DIFFERENTIALS SO FOR INSTANCE THESE TEDDY BEARS WERE ON A BIG BOX WEBSITE. THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO CHARGE 22% MORE FOR THE PINK TEDDY BEAR THEN THE BLUE TEDDY BEAR. IF YOU LOOK AT THE RAZORS OVER HERE- THE RAZORS- A DIFFICULT SHIP RAZORS. LOU AND PAYING. EIGHT FIFTY NINE TO ELEVEN NINETY NINE THAT'S A- 13% INCREASE FOR THE RAZORS- AND THEN IF YOU LOOK AT THESE SHOES. DOLLARS THESE ARE SIXTY DOLLARS THAT IS A DIFFERENTIAL OF 33% IN THERE EXACTLY THE SAME DOWN TO THE SOLES ON THE BOTTOM. CUSTOMER SURE- SERGEANT WE HAVE SERGEANT HEALTH. SOUTH IT'S REAL MONEY AND WHEN YOU RECOGNIZE THAT WOMEN OVER THEIR LIFETIME BECAUSE OF THE PAY GAP ALONE. ARE LOSING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DISPOSABLE INCOME IT'S REALLY SERIOUS SO- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO ADDRESS THIS I GUESS THAT THE REAL TOPPER WAS LAST WEEK IN TENNESSEE. WHERE TENNESSEE WAS GOING TO OFFER A TAX HOLIDAY FOR THE PURCHASE OF CARS AND APPLIANCES AND THEY HAD- CONTEMPLATED WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD INCLUDE TAMPONS. AND THEN THEY DECIDED NOT TO INCLUDE TAMPONS BECAUSE IT WOULD LOSE SO MUCH REVENUE TO THE STATE OR THERE'D BE A RUN ON TAMPONS NOW IF THAT'S NOT CITY IS DISCRIMINATION I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS SO. IT'S THERE M. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO FIX THAT- IN MY WORK IN WASHINGTON. WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL VERY RECENTLY AND GETTING THE DEADLINE STRICKEN FROM THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT IT'S NOW BEEN PASSED BY THIRTY EIGHT STATES. SO IT SHOULD BECOME PART OF OUR CONSTITUTION- IT NOW IS- SITTING IN THE SENATE WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SOMEHOW KNOWLEDGE THE PRESIDENT THE SENATE TO TAKE IT OUT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF VOTES TO PASS IT. IF GENDER DISCRIMINATION WERE PROHIBITED IN THE CONSTITUTION ALL OF THESE CASES. WOULD BE DEALT WITH BECAUSE YOU COULD BRING AN ACTION STATING THAT IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT'S DISCRIMINATORY AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO ADDRESS IT ON EVERY LEVEL BUT WOMEN ARE THE BIG. CONSUMERS OF PRODUCTS THEY PURCHASE ABOUT 7280% OF ALL CONSUMABLE PRODUCTS. IN THE COUNTRY SO- WE SHOULD. RECOGNIZE THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE PURCHASING POWER THEY ALSO HAVE THE POWER TO SAY THIS KIND OF DISCRIMINATION SHOULD NOT CONTINUE- AND I THINK WITH THAT MISSY FIVE AREA AND THOUGHTS THAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU. YOU KNOW THAT WE OFTEN SAY THAT THAT THIS KIND OF DISCRIMINATION GOES ON FROM CRADLE TO GRAVE AND I DIDN'T BRING THE SAMPLES BECAUSE THEY WERE A LITTLE BULKY FROM WASHINGTON BUT- ADULT DIAPERS HE WENT INTO A WALGREENS. I DON'T THIS WAS MAYBE A FEW MONTHS AGO MAYBE THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR THEIR PRICING BUT IF YOU BOUGHT A WOMAN'S ADULT DIAPERS. THEY WERE THE SAME PRICE AS THE MAN THE DAHLE DIAPERS EXCEPT YOU GOT FOUR DIAPERS LESS. THEN THE MEN'S ADULT DIAPERS SO IT IS FROM CRADLE TO GRAVE AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO FIX IT WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR I WILL FEEL THE REST OF MY TIME THANK YOU SENATOR SPEAR. NOW IF THERE QUESTIONS I HAVE A FEW BUT IF ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO START I THINK THAT'S QUITE AN INTERESTING VISUAL ALSO THE NEW YORK- THE CITY OF NEW YORK DID A RATHER LENGTHY STUDY OF SOME EIGHT HUNDRED PRODUCTS AND THEY DISCOVERED NOT ONLY WERE ONESIES MORE EXPENSIVE IF THEY WERE IN PINK THEN IF THEY WERE IN NON PINK BUT EVEN CANES FOR OUR SENIORS WOMEN PAY MORE FOR CAIN. THEY'LL THEORETICALLY WE ARE SHORTER I IT'S JUST IT'S MIND BOGGLING THAT THAT THAT IS THE CASE AND OF COURSE- THE YOU KNOW I GUESS TO TERRY'S WELL YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH THE YOU CAN DO IT- BUT THAT'S WHY WE HEAR SO I DID HAVEA COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU- HOW DO YOU- HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THOSE YOU MENTIONED THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND OF COURSE IN CALIFORNIA AS YOU WELL KNOW AS WELL AS ANYONE- THIS THE LEGISLATION THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IN THIS AREA. IS UNDER THE UNDER THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AND THE ON RESERVE A RIGHT CHECK WHICH HAS BEEN IN FORCE IN EFFECT SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY NINE CALLS FOR A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION- AFTER YOU GOT YOUR BILL PASSED ON SERVICES DID WE SEE ANY KIND OF A FLOODGATE OF LITIGATION WE HEAR THIS ALL THE TIME BUT FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS AND SO FORTH IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO. AND FOR THEIR DID DID YOU SEE. DID WE SEE CA OF. OPEN AS FAR AS THE WAS. I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN ONE ACTION BROUGHT. IN COURT IN CALIFORNIA. BASED ON THE SERVICES ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAW SO THERE IS NO FLOOD GATE OF CASES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORTH BUT WE DO KNOW THERE'S PLENTY OF VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW THAT. MANY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STILL. DISTINGUISHING AND DISCRIMINATING BASED ON GENDER IN TERMS OF THE PRICING YOU CAN SEE SANDWICH BOARDS LOCAL STREETS WERE THERE. SHE OFFERING HAIR CUTS AND- MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THEY'RE CHARGING MORE FOR A WOMAN'S HAIR CUT I GO INTO THOSE ESTABLISHMENTS AND TRY TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THEIR VIOLATING THE LAW BUT- DOESN'T SEEM TO BOTHER THEM THEY ALSO DON'T WANT TO GIVE ME A HAIR CUT. THAT'S PROBABLY SMART THE UNITED WHEN FROM THEM EITHER BUT OF COURSE WITH HER CUTS THE DIFFERENTIAL IN PRICING IT CAN BE LEGITIMATE IF IT TAKES MORE TIME IF TAKES FIVE MINUTES. THE LAW PROVIDES IT SHOULD BE IF YOU'RE SHORT AS YOURS IS- YOU KNOW IT DOES IT TAKE MORE TIME TO CUT YOUR HAIR THAN TO CUT. YOUR GENERAL COUNSELS MAYBE. I HOPE SO. BUT THE THAT'S THE POOL SINCE THE POINT NO NO NO I THINK THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS PRICING THAT'S BASED ON GENDER. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS LEGISLATION TALKS ABOUT IF THERE'S A LEGITIMATE JUSTIFICATION IF THE COST OF A PRODUCT OF THAT IS GOING INTO SOMETHING THAT WE SELL IF THE COSTS THAT PRODUCT IS MORE THAN YOU CAN CHARGE MORE BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO CHARGE MORE CASSETTES PINK AND THAT'S BLACK THAT IS NOT. SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SAY ARE EXACTLY THE SAME SHIP DOWN TO THE HEELS THE OR TO THE TO THE SOLES OF THE SHOES OF THE SAME THING WITH THAT SO MANY OF THESE PRODUCTS- SO- SO THE ARGUMENT THAT IS GOING TO OPEN A FLOODGATE A LITIGATION IS JUST NOT ACCURATE- YOU HAVE. IN RECENT CON. WE'VE HEARD THAT TO US SOME PEOPLE ARGUE THE MARKET WILL SOLVE THIS ISSUE SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION- DID YOU ALSO HEAR THOSE ARGUMENTS BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WHEN YOU WERE. A PUSHING THE LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE PAIN TAX FOR SERVICES. AND DO YOU THINK THAT THE MARKET HAS IN FACT FIX THAT PROBLEM IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS I THINK THE EVIDENCE- SPEAKS FOR ITSELF NOT ONLY HAS IT NOT- FIX THE PROBLEM OF THE PROBLEM. IN MANY RESPECTS HAS BEEN EXACERBATED. AND THAT'S BECAUSE- BECAUSE- SELLERS CAN GET AWAY THINK THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT AND TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF MAXIMIZING THEIR PROFITS. SO YOUR BILL IS BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS- YOU ARE EXPECTING NEVER HEARING AT WHAT POINT. WE THINK WITHIN THE NEXT TWO OR THREE MONTHS. AND IS THERE ANYTHING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN SUGGEST- BASED UPON YOUR EXPERIENCE AS FAR AS- THIS LEGISLATION WE'RE INTRODUCING IN CALIFORNIA TO YOU- ANTICIPATE TO SIMILAR COMPLAINTS TO AS TO WHAT YOU HEARD BACK IN. THE NINETEEN NINETIES FOR YOUR LEGISLATION AND HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT SO. THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN ARGUMENT MADE THE QUESTION BECOMES IT IS THIS A FORMER DISCRIMINATION. IF YOU CAN MAKE THE CASE THAT YOU POINTED OUT THAT IT TAKES MORE TIME TO SELL THAT PAIRED TOGETHER OR TO CUT THAT HERE THAT IS A LEGITIMATE BASIS BUT NOT. SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS PINK OR BLUE SO ON IT AS IT RELATES TO MY LEGISLATION IT WOULD MAKE THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION- THE ARBITER AND IT WOULD BE DEEMED TO BE A VIOLATION- UNDER THE LAW AS AN UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE PRACTICE. HE WOULD ALSO GIVE THE STATE'S ATTORNEY'S GENERALS THE AUTHORITY TO BRING CIVIL ACTION ON BEHALF OF ALL RESIDENTS OF THEIR STATE- IN ORDER TO. COMPEL COMPLIANCE BUT YOU ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CERTAINLY KNOW AS AS MEMBERS OF FROM THIS AUGUST BODY IS THAT. A CALIFORNIA OFTEN LEADS THE WAY. AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES WHEN I WAS HERE WE WOULD PASS LEGISLATION AND THEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD TAKE NOTICE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE FIFTY DIFFERENT STATE. RULES AND I THINK IF YOU WOULD HAVE. KIND OF PAVE THE WAY ONCE AGAIN THAT OULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO US ON A FEDERAL LEVEL. THANK YOU EXACTLY WHAT I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD SAY- SENATOR RUBIO THE- AND THEN SENATOR UNDER US. FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING TO SEE US HERE TODAY WERE HONORED TO HAVE YOU- ESPECIALLY FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ON THIS ISSUE. AND I THINK THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT DISCRIMINATION AS IT PERTAINS TO PAYING AND BLUE OR PINK AND BLACK FOR MALE VERSUS FEMALE ME WE KNOW THAT ALSO WE HAVE INVOLVED AS A SOCIETY AND IT'S ALSO. DISCRIMINATORY DISCRIMINATORY IN DIFFERENT FRIENDS BECAUSE WE WERE ALSO MAKING ASSUMPTION THAT. MEN WOULD PREFER BLACK VERSUS PAYING QUIRK OR VICE VERSA SO I THINK THAT- AGAIN AS A SOCIETY WE HAVE A BOB AS A PERTAINS TO COLORS AND PREFERENCES AND NOW PEOPLE CHOOSE DIFFERENT COLORS FOR DIFFERENT TIMES AND- AND DIFFERENT. IN OCCASION SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WOULD JUST ALSO BE CURIOUS TO. TO KNOW. CERTAIN RESPECT BECAUSE NOW WE KNOW WE HAVE THE LGBT COMMUNITY WE HAVE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY NINE NON BY IN BINARY AND SO NOW THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK. TO NOT JUST PAINT AND BLACK SO YOU KNOW I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO SEE YOU YOU KNOW ALSO RESEARCH ON THAT FRONT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW DO. ALSO ARE THERE IN ALL GENDERS FEEL DISCRIMINATED NOT JUST FEMALES BUT TRANSIT AND- INTO TO BE TO Q. CAN BE SELF. THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE EVERY TO US I WOULD LET TO SET UP A THANK YOU SO MUCH I REALLY. IT WILL COME THIS AND I THINK THAT YOU YOU START. AT THIS AND YOU PAVE THE WAY FOR NOW TAKE THEM TO THE FOR THAT. SENATOR I'M AS I COULD DO THE TWO. THE THIS OFFICE OF RESEARCH PROVIDE US. POLITY RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN. AROUND PROTECT NOW. POSSIBLE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH COULD. TO THE KIND OF A RE SUGGESTS AND MAYBE UPDATE THE RE SIX COULD BE DONE ON PRODUCTS BECAUSE THAT LAST REVIEW WAS ON SERVICES. HOPE WE CAN DO THAT HI ADD THAT SO YEARS A WINDY DAVIS WAS ON THE FLOOR OF THE LET. WE WERE IN SUCH. AND CHOOSE WEARING KINKS. AND WE WANTED A TO ON HER AS A AFTER THAT IT NINE OR TEN OR LIVE IN OUR CAN'T MAY FOR. THEY WANTED TO GET RID OF THE REPORT. HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION THAT THAT EVERYONE HAD FOUGHT SO HARD FOR- AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT SOME OF OUR MALE COLLEAGUES DID HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING PINK SNEAKERS IN MIL SIZES. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE WERE A FEW WHO REALLY WANTED TO I DON'T KNOW OF SENATOR HILL WAS ABLE TO DO THAT ARE YOU MORE PINK TIE BUT A CLEARLY WE STILL HAVE THAT- THAT BIAS AND THOSE OBSTACLES TO ADDRESS- I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WEAR THE PINK ONES FOR MUCH MYSELF- BUT I'D BE INTERESTS SEE HOW MANY OF OUR MALE COLLEAGUES WHO ACTUALLY BOUGHT THOSE PINK SNEAKERS. ARE PREPARED TO WEAR THEM ON THE FLOOR TODAY SENATOR RUSSELL THE FLOORS YES. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SENATOR CONGRESS WOMAN. AND WHATEVER OTHER TITLES I YOU HAVE- MY QUESTION IS IF YOU HAVE ANY SENSE IN THE RESEARCH FOR YOU AND EXPERIENCE AS TO WHERE. AND HOW THE DECISION IS MADE ABOUT. TRY MORE. BECAUSE WE KNOW IN THE READ WORLD. THERE'S DIFFERENT LEVELS AND THE COMPANY THAT SELLS THESE PRODUCTS SO. IS IT THE MANUFACTURER IS IT. YOU KNOW AT THE- STORE LEVEL THE RETAIL LEVEL IS AT THE WHOLESALE LEVEL TO HAVE ANY SENSE OF THAT BECAUSE- IT SEEMS TO ME IT IN THE- END THE LEGISLATION RIGHT TO REALLY HOLD. THE DECISION MAKER ACCOUNTABLE IT BE GOOD TO MAKE SURE WE COVERED OURS OURSELVES ON ALL THOSE LEVELS BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE HEAR ABOUT THOSE DIFFERENT. LEVELS OF A COMPANY OR MANY COMPANIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN I 'T ONE TO SLIP AWAY IF THAT'S WITH THE DECISIONS BEING MADE. QUESTION SENATOR IN SOME CASES I THINK IT'S THE MANUFACTURE BUT IN SOME CASES IT'S A DISTRIBUTOR IN SOME CASES IT'S THE RETAILER. BUT THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT HAVE- ONLINE COMPANIES NOW THAT HAVE RECOGNIZED THE- HELLO. HOW WRONG THIS IS AND ONE OF THE COMPANIES IS CALLED BOXED AND THEY SELL PRODUCTS ONLINE AND THEY MAKE A POINT OF. A PROMOTING THEIR PRODUCTS. AS NON DISCRIMINATORY SO IF YOU BOUGHT TEDDY BEARS FROM THEM THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE SAME PRICE. AND WE WILL BE HEARING FROM THE COMPANY. SO YES THAT IS SO IT DOES. SOME SOME OF THE DETERMINATIONS ARE MADE AT THE MANUFACTURING LEVEL SOME OF THE DISTRIBUTION LEVEL AND SOME OF THE RETAIL LEVEL AND THE BILL TRIES TO GET AT THAT THE PARTICULAR DECISION MAKER. SO IF A MANUFACTURER FOR EXAMPLE- ITEMIZE HIS AND CHARGES MORE FOR THE PRODUCT AND THEN THAT IS ABSORBED GOING FORWARD IT'S THE MANUFACTURER THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING TO IF IT COMES TO A RETAIL STORE BIG BOX OR AMAZON OR SOME ONLINE COMPANY. AND THEY JUST DECIDE TO CHARGE MORE THE BILL WOULD ADDRESS THEIR BEHAVIOR. A SENATOR HILL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IS THE YOU TO MY CONGRESS WHO IS A- ALWAYS SUCH A OF. A LEADER WHEN IT COMES TO. JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING IN FACT WHEN I THINK OF IT BUT TO BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY CONSUMER RIGHTS AND CONSUMER TO CONSUMER PROTECTION AND CERTAINLY THE- THE EQUALITY THAT WE ALL WANT AND EXPECT FROM- FROM A MARKET PLACE IN WERE NOT SEEN THAT I REMEMBER IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHEN YOU HAVE THAT LEGISLATION AND WE'RE PUSHING IT. IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE AT THE TIME THAT YOU COULD GO TO A DRY CLEANERS AND YOU KNOW MY WIFE'S BLOUSE WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MY ALWAYS NEWS OR BUT I ALWAYS FELT THERE HAD TO BE A REASON FOR IT. BUT WHAT WOULD IN IN FOLLOWING UP ON SENATOR GRUDGES. QUESTION THIS IS SO PERVASIVE FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN AND THEN LOOK AT THE NEW YORK STUDY THAT WE HAVE A COPY OF. IT JUST TOUCHES EVERY AREA. OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND WHICH WOULD STRIKES ME IS. THERE HAS TO BE SOME. SOME SOME IN LOOKING FOR TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PANEL THERE HAS TO BE REAL REAL FOR THIS TO ME THE MARKET TO TECHNIQUE SECRET THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT BY TO EDIT AND ONE THAT IT IT WORKS IN THAT PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND THAT AND EXPECT THAT THERE WOULD BE DIFFERENT SO I'M I'M TRYING TO GET AT THE HEART IN THAT THE- THE CORE OF THE ISSUE AND THEN AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE CAN CORRECT IT FROM THERE AND MOVE FORWARD SO I I'M JUST. I'M EXCITED TO MOVE FORWARD IN SUPPORTING THE BILL IN THE LEGISLATION YES SENATOR THERE'S A LINE THAT IS USED IN MADISON AVENUE THAT SAYS THAT SHRINK IT AND PICK IT IN YOU CAN MAKE MORE PROFIT. INTEREST FOR THE NEXT THAT'S WHERE IT'S COMING FROM THANK YOU I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS STATE CHARGE MORE BECAUSE THEY CAN. AND HOPEFULLY WE GONNA. MAKE THEM MAKE PEOPLE MORE AWARE YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD. WITH THE SHORT HIKE D. TO FOLLOW PLEDGES. AND SO YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY. BECAUSE I HAD TAKEN MY HUSBAND'S SHIRT TO THE CLEANER IN MARCH FOR TO THE CLEANERS MY HUSBAND'S SIX FOUR. HUNDRED EIGHTY POUNDS AND I'M NOT. AND HE SURE COST A DOLLAR AND A QUARTER TO LAUNDER AND MINE COST FOUR DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS. AND SO I ASKED THEM WHY IN THEIR EXPLANATION WAS WELL HIS SHIRT BUTTONS ON. THE BUTTONS ON A MAN'S SHIRT BUTTON RIGHT TO LEFT OR LEFT TO RIGHT I CAN REMEMBER AND YOURS BUTTON IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. AND THE PRESSES THAT WE USE- ARE ACCOMMODATE A MAN'S SHIRT BUT CAN'T ACCOMMODATE A WOMAN'S SO WE HAVE TO HAND. IRON A WOMAN SHIRT. AND I REMEMBER THEM THINKING MY GOODNESS WE PUT A MAN ON THE MOON WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS. FAST FOR TWENTY YEARS LATER IT'S STILL THE SAME PROBLEM WHY. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T. SO THAT'S ANOTHER. BUT A THAT'S- AND WE KNOW YOU GAVE AN EXAMPLE EARLIER OF THE BOYFRIENDS- ASSURED WHY DON'T YOU. CLOSE WITH THAT BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T MISS YOUR PLANE- GONNA GET BACK TO. DC THERE AND- IT AS AN EXAMPLE IF YOU SHARE WITH US THAT STORY ABOUT THE MAN'S SHIRT. BOYFRIEND SHIRT. I THOUGHT IT ACTUALLY A OUT. MR HALL OF OUR HEART OKAY ALL RIGHT BUT I GUESS IT WAS ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT WERE VERY AWAY OF WHO WERE. OF ACTUALLY MARKETING THE BOY FOR. SHIRT WOMEN NOW THAT THEY HAD DESIGNED ONE SO YOU CAN BE JUST LIKE YOUR BOYFRIEND EXCEPT YOU COULD HAVE YOUR YOUR MATCHING HAVE MATCHED MATCHING SHIRTS THAT THEY CHARGE MORE FOR THE GIRLFRIEND SHERATON. BOY FURNITURE. SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE IN AND WE'LL YOU US MUCH FOR YEARS ON THIS IN YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A HONORING A PLAY FOR ME TO TRY TO FOLLOW IN YOUR VERY LARGE FOOTSTEPS ON THESE ISSUES AND I JUST THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING SOME SUCCESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND HOPEFULLY IN WASHINGTON DC ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR INTO TO ALL OF YOU. I THINK I WOULD JUST CLOSE BY SAYING WE REALLY ARE THE GUARDIANS FOR THE PUBLIC MANY OF MY LEADS PIECES OF LEGISLATION ON CONSUMER PROTECTION HAD TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT I FELT THAT WE WERE THEIR GUARDIAN AND IT WAS OUR OBLIGATION TO GO WHERE THEY MAY NOT SEE A NEED- OR NOT MAY NOT BE EDUCATED ABOUT. A PARTICULAR ISSUE AND- MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE THERE TO PROTECT THEM SO- I KNOW YOU WILL DO THE RIGHT THING AND I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU SO MUCH COMMERCE MEMBER SAFE TRAVELS AND KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK WE- THINK WE ALL ADMIRED. YOUR POSITIONS. SO WITH I'M TO GO BACK AND ADJUST TO IT ALSO WOULD MAKE IT COM THAT WILL WERE PRO I THINK IS AN INTRODUCTION BUT BEING COGNIZANT OF THE CONGRESSWOMAN SAYS SCHEDULE THAT LET ME JUST SAY I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WERE WE'RE DOING HERE IS. WE WANT OUR BILL. IN AND TO THRIVE. AS THEY ARE NOW SO THE GOAL HERE IS TO ALLOW IN TO ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO DO SO TO MAKE PROFITS CREATE JOBS. BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS. WHAT I BELIEVE NONE OF US SHOULD TOLERATE IS PRICING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS. THEY SHOULD NOT BE DISCRIMINATION AND PRICING AND I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WHILE- I BELIEVE THE PINK TAX IS WRONG. AS I MENTIONED. A I AND I THINK EVERYONE ON THIS DíAS IS LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. THE BEST WAY TO ELIMINATE THAT- THAT WILL BE EFFECTIVE SO NOT A WHIT WINDOW DRESSING APPROACH BUT SOMETHING THAT REALLY IS GOING TO BE FAIR TO THE WOMEN AND THE FAMILIES. IN OUR STATE AND HOPEFULLY THAT THE NATION WILL THEN FOLLOW SO. THE GOAL IS TO THINK A- IN BROAD TODAY AND- THIS IS NOT. JUST THE KIND OF A ROAD HEARING I THINK WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME REAL ANSWERS SOME REAL DISCUSSION. I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN WORK WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO HAVE INDICATED. THEIR INITIAL STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THAT THE- WILL COME TO THE TABLE AND WORK WITH US TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT ADDRESSES THAT PROBLEM WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. ENCOURAGING BUSINESS TO CONTINUE TO FLOURISH SO. I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TWO PANELS AT THE END WILL INVITE ANY MEMBER THE PUBLIC OR ANYONE WHO IS NOT OTHERWISE BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO COME FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE. OF FOR IT TO UP TO TWO MINUTES TO SHARE THEIR PERSPECTIVES. AND THEN IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE WILL COME TOGETHER AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY AND WORK OUT A SOLUTION TO THIS TO THIS ISSUE SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO- LET ME- ASK OUR FIRST A PANEL. TO COME FORWARD- THEY'LL ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL IMPACTS OF THE PINK TAX ON WOMEN'S LIVES WE HAVE. DOCTOR ELIZABETH SUITE. HE WOULD COME FORWARD- SHE'S AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN SOCIOLOGY IN INTERDISCIPLINARY SOCIAL SCIENCES AT SAN JOSE STATE. OF HER FOCUS IN RESEARCHES ON GENDER AND CHILDREN'S TOYS SO SOME OF THESE ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR TO YOU. SHE EARNED HER PHD IN SOCIOLOGY AT UC DAVIS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. AND IS INTERESTED BROADLY IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CULTURAL BELIEFS AND SOCIAL INEQUALITIES. OF HER CURRENT RESEARCH EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN GENDER. CHILDREN'S TOYS AND GENDER INEQUALITY OVER THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IN A SOMEONE WHO HATED DOLLS AS A LITTLE GIRL AND WANTED TO PLAY BASEBALL. I'LL BE VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY WE ALSO HAVE WITH US SERENA CON. WHO IS THE CITY CHIEF A. OFFICER OF THE WOMEN'S FOR. UNDER OF CAL. THE READ. X. ON. RACE ANY JUST AND A FREE COM. ON THE- OF WOMEN'S FULLER. HER WRITING RESEARCH OF THE PUBLISHED WIDELY IMPRINT AND ONLINE. INCLUDING THE SACK BE THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWSTHE STANFORD SOCIAL INNOVATION REVIEW. AND THE PHILANTHROPY NEWS DIGEST THANK YOU BOTH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO SHARE YOUR EXPERTISE WITH US TODAY AND LET'S START. WITH DR SUITE. MEMBERS IT'S TRULY HONOR TO BE HERE YOU TODAY. USING MY IS DOCTOR SWEET AND I'M IN A SYSTEM OF SOCIOLOGY AT SAN THESE. MY EXPERTISE A JACKSON'S LIES IN THE AREA GENDER AND CALLED AND MY CURRENT RESEARCH FOCUSES ON JENNER MARKETING IN STEREO TYPING OF CHILDREN'S TOYS OVER TIME. SO IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF THE PINK TAX THAT MS KAHN WILL BE SPEAKING AT. I'M JENNER PRODUCTS AND PRICING ALSO HAVE CULTURAL CONSEQUENCES FOR MY REMARKS WILL FOCUS ON THE CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE OF DENT GENDER DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS AND PRICING. WHY OF THE THINGS I FIND IN MY RESEARCH IS THAT WHILE THE GENDER MARKETING OF TOYS HAS VARIED OVER TIME THIS PRACTICE HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES. IN MY ANALYSIS OF OVER SEVEN THOUSAND SEARS CATALOGUE TôI ADVERTISEMENTS THAT SPAN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY I FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY OF TOYS WERE MARKETED IN A NON GENDERED OR GENDER INCLUSIVE WAY. EVEN IN THE DECADES ONE GENDER MARKETING WAS THE MOST PRONOUNCED GENDER TOYS STILL ONLY MADE UP AROUND HALF OF THE TOYS ADVERTISE IT. IN CONTRAST A TWENTY TWELVE STUDY BY SOCIOLOGISTS OSTERN MONTHS BACH FOUND THAT ALL OF THE TOYS IN THE DISNEY ONLINE STORE WERE CATEGORIZED BY ENDER. AND GENDER DIFFERENT DIFFERENTIATION ISN'T JUST A FEATURE OF CHILDREN'S TOYS I TWENTY NINETEEN STUDY BY STANFORD RESEARCHERS FOUND EVIDENCE OF EXTENSIVE GENDER TYPING AN ADULT PRODUCT MARKETS AS WELL. ADDITIONALLY I FIND IN MY RESEARCH THAT THE PRACTICE OF CREATING SEPARATE GENDER CODED VERSIONS OF THE SAME TôI ONLY EMERGES AT THE TAIL END OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. THE HISTORICAL VARIATION IN THE CHEN OR MARKETING OF TOYS AND OTHER PRODUCTS TELLS US THAT THESE ITEMS ARE NOT INHERENTLY GENDERED. RATHER THE GENDER CODING OF PRODUCTS REFLECTS OUR CULTURAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES IT ALSO TELLS US THAT ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF PRODUCING MARKETING AND PRICING PRODUCTS IS POSSIBLE. THIS BEGS THE QUESTION THEN WHY DO COMPANIES DESIGN MARKET AND SOMETIMES PRICE PRODUCTS DIFFERENTLY ACCORDING TO GENDER. THE GROWTH OF MARKET SEGMENTATION AND TARGETING MARKETING PRACTICES IN PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST DECADES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY A BIG PART OF THIS STORY. COMPANIES ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO INCREASE SALES SO WHY SOMEONE FAMILY ONE BOTTLE OF SHAMPOO WHEN YOU COULD SELL EACH MEMBER OF THAT FAMILY THEIR OWN BOTTLE. COMPANIES USE GENDER TO SEGMENT THE MARKET BECAUSE IT'S AN EASILY IDENTIFIABLE CHARACTERISTIC AROUND WHICH MUCH OF SOCIAL LIFE IS ORGANIZED. GENDER STEREOTYPES LEE AT THE CORE OF MARKET SEGMENTATION AND TARGETING STRATEGIES. PRODUCT MAKERS OF MARKETERS OFTEN RELY HEAVILY ON STEREOTYPES IN THEIR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT MALES AND FEMALES ARE LIKE WHAT THEY SHOULD BE LIKE AND WHAT THEY WANT. MARKETING PROFESSOR SUSAN MARKETING TO DESCRIBE HOW COMPANIES USE CHARACTERISTICS LIKE GENDER TO MARKET AND IN THE PROCESS ACTUALLY CREATE THE VERY DIFFERENCES THEY CLAIM TO ADDRESS. THE BIG FOR HER PENS THAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT OUR GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS HAS A SUGGESTED THAT WOMEN SOMEHOW HAD FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT RATING NEEDS THAN MEN EVEN THOUGH MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN USING THE SAME TENS. OF OVERTIME. I TWO THOUSAND STUDY WHICH- GENDER PRICE DIFFERENCE AND- FOUND THAT THE- WHICH- MOST TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF WHAT THE AUTHORS CALL THE GENDER ITSELF THINGS LIKE HAIR STYLES AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. ARE ALSO THE MOST LIKELY TO BE PRICE DIFFERENTLY BY GENDER. SOME PRODUCTS ARE NOT INHERENTLY GENDERED AS I AM ARGUING THAT HOW DID THEY BECOME ENGENDERED. COMPANIES TYPICALLY HAVE A TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC IN MIND WHEN THEY CREATE A PRODUCT EVEN IF THE PRODUCT ITSELF IS OSTENSIBLY GENDER NEUTRAL. THERE ARE SEVERAL STRATEGIES THAT THEY THEN USED TO GENDER DIFFERENT CHEAP PRODUCTS SOMETIMES PRODUCTS ARE CHEN EXPLICITLY GENDER LABEL FOR EXAMPLE MEN'S RAZORS ARE GIRLS SCOOTERS. IN OTHER CASES COMPANIES RELY MORE IMPLICIT THOUGH OFTEN NO LESS OBVIOUS CUES. THESE MAY INCLUDE THE PLACEMENT OF PRODUCTS IN STORES AND ONLINE PAGES THE USE OF A GENDERED MODEL IN PRODUCT PACKAGING OR MARKETING AND THE USE OF LANGUAGE THAT EVOKES GENDER TEREOTYPES IN THE PRODUCT PACKAGING OR MARKETING WORDS LIKE TOUGH A DELICATE. COLOR AS- THE CO PAYING AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING. HAS COME TO SERVE AS A PRETTY STRONG GENDER USE TO DEFINE GEN. CONSUMER HOWEVER COUNTRY TO POP BELIEF THIS IS A RELATIVELY. THAT IN HER RE ON HISTORICAL. DOCTOR JOE PALE FOUND THAT THE PINK FOR BLUE SORRY PAYING FOR AND FOR BOY COLORS. ONLY EMERGE IN THE FOR. AND ONLY GAINED POPULARITY IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES SIMILARLY I FIND NO EVIDENCE OF WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO DEBT THE PINK OF VACATION OF GIRLS TOYS IN MY RESEARCH AND EMERGING INTO THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. WHILE THE USE OF COLOR AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE A GENDER AS HISTORIC REESE AND- RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE USE OF COLOR INFLUENCES BOTH HOW PEOPLE CLASSIFIED THE GENDER OF A PRODUCT. WHETHER THAT THEY FEEL THAT OUR PRODUCT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THEM. THE GENDER CATEGORIZATION OF MARKETING A PRODUCT IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THE GENDER STEREOTYPES THAT FORM THE BASIS OF THIS PRACTICE ARE ALSO DEEPLY IMPLICATED. IN THE PROCESS HE'S AT SUSTAIN GENDER INEQUALITY IN OUR SOCIETY. THERE'S A WEALTH OF RESEARCH IN SOCIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY LINKING GENDER STEREOTYPES TO PERSISTENT SOCIETAL INEQUALITY IS LIKE THE GENDER SO I CREATION OF OCCUPATIONS AND THE GENDER WAGE GAP. THIS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT GENDER STEREOTYPES CAN HAVE POWERFUL EFFECTS ON BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS ON TASK PERFORMANCE AND HOW WE EVALUATE OURSELVES AND OTHERS. AND IMPORTANTLY ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO BELIEVE THE STEREOTACTIC FOR IT TO HAVE THAT PROFOUND EFFECT ALL THAT'S NECESSARY IS TO KNOW THAT IT'S OUT THERE AND THE OTHERS BELIEVE IT TO BE TRUE. GIVEN THE DATA FROM EFFECTS OF GENDER STEREOTYPES IT IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING THAT THEY BECOME SO DEEPLY WOVEN INTO THEIR DESIGN MARKETING AND PRICING OF CONTEMPORARY CONSUMER PRODUCTS. WHAT THE GENDER MARKETING IN DIFFERENT- PRICING OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IT IS ONE THAT IS NEITHER INEVITABLE NOR INTRACTABLE. IN FACT THERE ARE SOME SIGNS THAT COMPANIES MAY BE SHIFTING BACK TOWARDS MORE GENDER NEUTRAL PRODUCT DESIGN AND MARKETING AS A RECENT WALL STREET JOURNAL ARTICLE ENTITLED DOES YOUR REYES ARE NEEDED GENDER EXPLAINS COMPANIES ARE COMING TO REALIZE GENDER DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS ARE INCREASINGLY AT ODDS WITH WHERE CONSUMERS ARE. AND SO I THINK I'LL LEAVE IT. THERE YOU SO MUCH I LOOK FOR YOUR CALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL. SERENA CONTAS AND THEN WE'LL OPEN AND FOR. THANK YOU. AIR MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS SIR. COME I. THE CEO OF THE WOMEN'S. OF CAL. WHICH IS A- SO. FOR THAT IS IN OUR FORTY FIRST YEAR THIS YEAR WE WERE FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE- AND WE INVEST IN AND TRAIN AND CONNECT COMMUNITY BASED LEADERS TO ADVANCE GENDER. RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE- AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE A WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE WHERE WE- TRAIN COMMUNITY BASED. LEADERS TO BE EFFECTIVE PUBLIC POLICY ADVOCATES MANY OF YOU HAVE. AUTHORED SOME OF THEIR BILLS THEY- THAT NETWORK OF NOW ALMOST SIX HUNDRED. A COMMUNITY LEADERS IS CONNECTED TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA THROUGH THEIR OWN NETWORKS. AND SO WE- WANT TO SUPPORT- AND REPRESENT THEIR INTERESTS WHICH IS WHY WE ARE HONORED TO BE A CO SPONSORING. SB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE- AND AS WE'VE HEARD EARLIER THAT DESPITE EXISTING LEGISLATION IT'S STILL FAR TOO EASY. FOR PRODUCTS MARKETED TOWARDS WOMEN TO COST MORE. AND CHARGING WOMEN FOR ESSENTIALLY THE SAME PRODUCTS IS GENDER DISCRIMINATION- WHICH IS WHY WE AT THE WOMEN'S FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA- THINK THAT WE NEED SENATE BILL EIGHT SEVENTY THREE THE PINK TAX. REPEAL ACT. THE PINK TAX REPEAL ACT TO RECTIFY IS AN INJUSTICE IN OUR MARKET PLACE THAT HAS. DRAMATIC IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DAY TO DAY LIVES AND FINANCIAL FUTURES OF WOMEN AND OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IN MY ROLE AS THE CEO OF THE WOMEN'S FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA. THE IMPORTANCE OF LEGISLATION- LIKE SB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE. THAT WRITES THE SCALES OF ECONOMIC AND JUSTICE- COULD NOT BE MORE CLEAR OR NEEDED- N THISPARTICULAR MOMENT. WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE WOMEN MAKE BETWEEN 7280% OF ALL CONSUMER PURCHASES. THAT MEANS THAT WOMEN ARE CALLING THE SHOTS ABOUT WHAT MAKES IT INTO THE SHOPPING CART BUT COMES HOME WITH US AND WHAT DOESN'T. SO WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE MARKETERS HAVE BEEN MANIPULATING THE PRICE OF CAN. GOODS FOR PROFIT ON BACKS OF WOMEN IN OUR EARNED MONEY. MARKETERS A BUNCH WITH A PINK TAX ADDITIONAL COSTS. FOR BEING WOMEN WHICH MEANS THAT HALF OF THE POPULATION IS BEING SUBJECTED TO AN ADDITIONAL TAX- AND SO IF WE THINK ABOUT LET'S SAY A MOM AND FRESNO WHO WANTS TO BUY A BICYCLE FOR HER ELEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER TO RIDE AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT NOW IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY LEGAL FOR THAT BICYCLE TO COST AS MUCH AS 13% MORE BECAUSE IT'S PINK AND MARKETED TOWARDS GIRLS. THIS KIND OF GENDER BASED MANIPULATION OF THE MARKET IS UNWARRANTED AND WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THE REALITIES OF OUR STATES GENDER PAY GAP IT BECOMES ALL THE MORE CRITICAL- THAT WE PASS AND IMPLEMENT SB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE. SO TO PUT THIS ANOTHER WAY WHICH IS THAT WOMEN EARN LESS AND PAY MORE THE PAINFUL TRUTH IS THAT LATINO WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA EARN ABOUT FORTY ONE CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT A MAN IS PAID. A BLACK WOMAN MIGHT BE TAKING HOME SIXTY CENTS ON A WHITE OR ASIAN WOMAN WOULD TOP OUT AT ABOUT EIGHTY CENTS- AND SO THIS MEANS THAT WORKING WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA LOSE OUT ON EIGHTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY BECAUSE OF THE GENDER PAY GAP THAT'S EIGHTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AND TRANSGENDER WOMEN. ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN POVERTY SINGLE MOTHERS IN CALIFORNIA ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S WELL BEING INDEX WHICH REPRODUCED WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER- SPEND NOT JUST ON TWO LINE ITEMS IN THEIR BUDGET- ON CHILD CARE AND HOUSING MORE THAN A 100% OF WHAT THEY'RE BRINGING HOME IN EVERYONE OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. SO WHEN YOU EXACERBATE THAT WITH THIS KIND OFGENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION IT'S REALLY COSTING OUR FAMILIES A LOT SO WHEN RECHARGE WOMEN GIRLS MORE FOR VERY SAME PRODUCTS WE'RE REALLY YOU KNOW CONTINUING THE DEEPER. INEQUALITY THAT EXIST ACROSS GENDER AND RACE LINES SO TO PUT A FINER POINT ON IT IN ORDER TO CLOSE THE ECONOMIC JASIM OPENED UP BY THE GENDER. PAY GAP OF LATINO WOMAN IN ROSEVILLE WHERE HAVE JUST. AN ADDITIONAL. FOUR ON THE UPTURN THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY HER WAY MALE. SHE'D HAVE TO WORK NEARLY AND HALF DAY. LONGER TO EARN THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY. SO WHEN WOMEN ARE CHARGE MORE FOR SOAP OR A TEACHER. IT ISN'T JUST AND FAIR IT FURTHER COMPOUNDS THE INJUSTICES THAT. THREATEN THEIR FINANCIAL WELL BEING AND THE ECONOMIC SECURITY OF THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES AND I WOULD ARGUE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH THE PINK TAX REPEAL ACT WE HAVE A CHANCE TO CORRECT THIS. WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE WE CAN BRING GREATER FAIRNESS TO OUR MARKETS AND WE CAN IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL HEALTH AD WELL BEING OF WOMEN AND GIRLS. ACROSS OUR STATE AS WELL AS OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES AND ADDRESS SOME OF THE- VERY REAL ISSUES OF POVERTY. HOMELESSNESS HOUSING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THAT ARE RELATED. TO GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION OF CONSUMER GOODS. I WANT TO REINFORCE THE REAL SCALE OF IMPACT THAT THE PAYING TAX REPEAL ACT WOULD HAVE. ON THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES. MORE THAN EVER BEFORE WOMEN ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING FOR THEIR FAMILIES FINANCIALLY. THE PRIMARY BREADWINNER AND NEARLY HALF OF AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN AS A WOMAN. SO WHEN WE ADVANCE LEGISLATION LIKE SB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE WE'RE NOT JUST RECTIFYING MANIPULATIONS OF THE MARKET THAT UNFAIRLY TARGET WOMEN WE'RE TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS TO MAKE SURE THAT CHILDREN ACROSS OUR STATE. ARE GROWING IN HOMES WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF FINANCIAL SECURITY ANDWELL BEING AND WE LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THAT GENDER DISCRIMINATION OF THE PAYING TAX IS EVER PRESENT ACROSS THE WOMAN'S LIFETIME WHAT WHEN SHE'S BORN THE PINK ONESIE IS GOING TO COST. 4% MORE WHEN SHE PLAYS MAKE BELIEVE HER TOYS WILL COST 7% MORE. AS IN IT SHE'S GOING TO BE CHARGED A PERCENT MORE FOR THE CLOTHES SHE PUTS ON. WHAT IN THE MORNING. UP 240% MORE WHEN SHE WASHES HER HAIR. AS SHE AGES THE CANE SHE USES TO GET AROUND IN THE ADULT DIAPERS THAT GIVE HER THAT EXTRA PEACE OF MIND WILL COST 8% MORE. OR MORE THE PINK TAX IMPACTS WOMAN FROM CRADLE TO GRAVE AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT IT MUST BE REPEALED. THE PENTAX FOR ANY ONE PURCHASE MAYBE RELATIVELY SMALL BUT OVER THE COURSE OF A LIFETIME IT REALLY ADDS UP. WHETHER YOU TAKE A PRIME THE WOMAN RIMARY YEARS ARE MEASURE BASED ON. EXPECTED THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT PEOPLE CAN. SIR THANK ENDS OF THE OF DOLLARS. PER WHICH IS A HIGH AND EIGHTY EIGHT THAT DOLLARS AND- THAN THEIR MALE. FOR WATER. EGGS THE SAME THING. SO WHY WOMEN GOTTEN SO PAYING PAINTER WERE ALSO THE ONES LEADING THE CHARGE TO AND IT'S WE THANK SENATOR. FOR HER. TO A- THIS BILL IS WELL AS SO MANY GENDER JUSTICE. A I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME ATTENTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT HI WOULD LIKE TO ADD DARK SUITE. UP PROHIBITING PAYING TAX WOULDN'T PREVENT BUSINESSES FROM BASED ON GENDER WOULD NOT ACTUALLY- A JUST COULDN'T PRY COULDN'T PRICE BASED ON GENDER OR AT OUR AND DO YOU THINK THE BUSINESSES WOULD MARKET LESS BASED ON GENDER IF THERE WERE NO FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO DO SO. ARE THEY MIGHT YEAH I OR THEY MIGHT YET BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE SAME PRODUCT BRAIDED BUT THEY WOULDN'T NECESSARILY GENDER CODED IN THE SAME WAY. AND HOW DOES THE CHEN ATION OF PRODUCTS AFFECT INDIVIDUALS. WHO DO NOT IDENTIFY IS EITHER BOY OR GIRL MAN OR WOMAN AS WAS SUGGESTED EARLIER BY SENATOR RUBIO I GUESS WE CALL IT NOW. GENDER FLUIDITY AND WE SEE IT MORE AND MORE IN OUR YOUNG KIDS TODAY AND TO- HOW HOW DO OF. HOW DOES THIS SAID GENDERS ATION AFFECT THE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WELL I THINK THE REALITY OF THE GENDER CUTTING OF PRODUCTS IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T NECESSARILY A LOT OF WOMEN WHO DON'T NECESSARILY LIKE PINK BUT IF THAT'S ALL YOU CAN FIND OUT SO YOU CAN FIND. TIAS POWER MAN LET WOMEN LIKE HER VERY SORT OF NEW. BRIDGET AND IT. LOT MORE VERY. MEN AND AMONG WOMEN THERE ARE GROUP LEVEL THAT BE THEM AND SIR THAT'S TRUE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE LIVE XP. FENDER IDENTITY GENDER EXPRESSION.FOR OKAY FLOW AND ON THE SPECTRUM THAN THE RIGID BINARY CARE. CHORUS. THANK YOU. ANY QUESTION IN THE DRAW. HOW MUCH A CO WELLS IS. THE NATURE OF TOLL OR THE PRICE I IS IT'S NOT THE TACK OR THE FIND. ISSUE AS MUCH AS IT IS HOW WERE REYES OUR SONS AND TO THINK THAT. THIS CALL. ME BY DOING THIS THE DECADE DE. THEN YOU PRETTY MUCH THE THEM THE THERE'S A CERTAIN CA FOR GIRLS AND WOMEN AND THEN THERE'S THIS COLOR NOT REALLY. IT'S A THE AWAY AWAY FOR HAVING EQUALITY SO I JUST WHAT I YOU KNOW I WAS A THIS SIGNS WITH WITH MY TO GRAN. THEY SAID YOU KNOW THEY WERE STILL YOUNG IN THEY WANTED IN ORDER SINCE I WAS LOOKING LOOK SO EXCITED BECAUSE I. A NASSAU KIND OF YOUR LIKE THE SPY CHI OF OUTFIT AND I WAS RELEASED THAT WE GET HOME THE OPEN IT THIS IS WEARING HIGH HEEL. AND OF THE- WOULD A NASA YOU SIGNED TO BE WARY. I MEAN YOU COULD BUT IT HAVE TO ANOTHER A WRIST PER. THAT IF YOU'RE DAHLE YOU HAVE TO BE THESE STILLER. MAYBE I'M JEALOUS BECAUSE CAN'T WORK MANY MORE. THE MAYBE THAT'S WHAT WAS THE CITY OF THE BUT A KIND OF GOES THINK OF. COLOR BUT TO THE NAY. OF THE- AND I KNOW WE'RE NOT GOING THAT THAT WITH THIS LATEST OR TWO DAYS. BUT IT'S IN THE DAY LOWTHAT REALLY BOTHERS. AND DEVELOPING PSYCH HAVE DOING A LOT OF RE ON THIS AND HAD NICK. RESEARCH TAKE YOU KNOW I TôI THAT. GENDER NEW. AND A PAIN DIFFERENT COLORS THOUGH IF THEY FIVE OUT THAT SHE HOW FEEL ABOUT THE TôI WHETHER THEY THINK OKAY THE END UP WITH AND HOW AYE. THATTôI BY GENDER. IT'S NOT THAT YOU KNOW HOW PINK TRACK IS A PING DAHLE AND A TRY ARE IN A- GENDER ITEMS THERE JUST ITEM. THAT HAVE BEEN PAID AND TO COLOR. YES SIR YOU MENTION KEY ARE THAT THAT WE THE WE A LOT OF THE IS DONE A LOT OF MY- I MEAN THERE. THIRD CORP. HUGE THAT ARE MARK BASED AND A LOT OF THESE. CUES A VERY A LOT OF THEM A BAY ON YOU KNOW IF. STUDIES AND SO FORTH SO THAT IS. THIS THAT IS OF THIS WHOLE THIS. I CANNOT IMAGINE A WOMAN GOING ON TO MAKE. ON THE NASA TRIPLE MAKING I BUT THE IN IN FISH. I WILL TO ASK SERENA. SOME HAVE ARGUED CAN. SPENDING IS IN WE CAN. SO IF A WOMAN SHE- TO SPEND MORE THAN THAT'S ON. TO HAVE A- THAT THANK. YEAH I THINK YOU KNOW WE'VE- HERE WHICH IS THAT WOMEN ARE IN CHARGE OF MUCH OF WHAT GOES IN OUR SHOPPING CART AND WHAT WE BRING HOME AND- WE AND AS THINGS ARE BEING MARKETED TO WOMEN AND GIRLS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE SOME. OF SOME OF THE CULTURAL- YOU KNOW. RIGID GENDER NORMS THAT ARE BEING REINFORCED BY THE MARKET. IT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR SOME WOMEN WHEN THEY HAVE- CHILDREN WHO WANT THE PINK ITEM VERSUS THE BLUE ITEM- TO GET THROUGH THE GROCERY STORE SO WOMEN ARE MAKING THESE CHOICES AND- THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO- SO I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US. TO LEGISLATE EQUITY AND EQUALITY- AND ADDRESS DISCRIMINATION WHERE IT EXISTS WHICH IS IN THIS- IN THE IN THE PRICING OF PRODUCTS. THE READ IN A COMMENT. ME WHAT WE USED TO SAY YEARS AGO ABOUT. BATTERED WOMEN WELL THEY CAN ALWAYS LEAVE. AND OF COURSE THERE THERE ARE SO MANY LAYERS TO THAT THEY CAN'T LEAVE AND I SUSPECT WHEN IT COMES THESE PRODUCTS. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN LEVELS OF- BOTH OVER TWO AND A SUBTLE DISCRIMINATION THAT ENTER INTO THIS THIS WHOLE PROCESS. LAST QUESTION OF FOR HOMES CON- DOES THE PINK TAX AFFECT ALL WOMEN EQUALLY OR DOES THE BURDEN FALLS ESPECIALLY HEAVILY ON WOMEN OF COLOR AND POOR WOMEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE THE HEADS OF HOUSEHOLD. YEAH I THINK IT FALLS MORE HEAVILY ON LOW INCOME WOMEN- I THINK IT FALLS MORE HEAVILY ON TRANSGENDER WOMEN- WHO ARE MOST MARGINALIZED WHEN IT COMES TO ECONOMIC SECURITIES SO. THE LAST WOMEN ARE PAYING AND THEN HAVING TO PAY MORE FOR PRODUCTS THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING TO BE AFFECTED. OR SO AND- SENATOR TO YOUR POINT I THINK THAT IT IS A- INCUMBENT US TO ADDRESS SYSTEMIC BARRIERS AND NOT LEAVE IT TO THE INDIVIDUAL TO SOLVE PROBLEMS- AT. THAT ARE CREATED BY. OUR CALLED AND OUR MARKETS SO WOULD YOU ARE BRIDGES ON SOME OF THESE BARRIERS EXAMPLE AM KNOW WE HERE OFFICE. AND ARE US BECAUSE- WE'RE NOT NEGOTIATING. OUR SALARIES BUT REALLY IF WE HAVE SALARY TRANSPARENCY IN WERE POSTING SALARIES AND WOMEN ARE GETTING PAID FOR WHAT THE POSITION PAYS THAT'S- ADDRESSING THE SYSTEMIC. BECAUSE. TO ANY OTHER. NO THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH REALLY PRE IT AND HOW THAT WE WILL CAN. TO GET YOUR INPUT IS MEASURE MOVES. SUMMER ARE. NICK PANEL OF BRINGS FORWARD BUSINESS THERE WHERE OLD LET'S SEE ONE TWO THREE.

WE REALLY DO NEED AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY'S INPUT ON HOW WE CAN BEST GO ABOUT ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM- AND I WANT TO SAY THAT FIRST OFF THAT WHEN WE TRIED.

SHARE OUR PERSON WITH YOUR- OF NOT ONLY A EIGHT THE PRESIDENT CAL BUT I'M THE PHONE OF NINETY DESIGN IN MARKETING IN LOS ANGELES I'M THE PAST OF THE LOS ANGELES. AND PROUD TO BE SERVING AS THE NOBLE CALIFORNIA PRESIDENT AS WELL. AND. WITH ME AS THE KEY TO HIS YOU KNOW. WE'RE PARTNERS IN IN LEADERSHIP FOR NOW A CALIFORNIA I LOOK FOR TO HER AND WE ARE SO OUR TIME HERE JUST SO YOU KNOW TO TRY TO KEEP IT FOR YOUR REQUEST. THE NATIONAL SAYS OF WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS BOB OKAY. REPRESENTS OVER ONE AND A HALF MILLION WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES IN ALL INDUSTRIES ACROSS OUR STATE. SB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE IS CONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA'S LONGSTANDING COMMITMENT TO EQUITY FOR CONSUMERS FOR SIXTY YEARS THE ON ROOF CIVIL RIVER CIVIL RIGHTS ACT HAS PROHIBITED BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS AND I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THEM A LITTLE BIT BUT- THIS IS DOUBLE THE LARGER POINT THAT I'M ABOUT TO MAKE. HAS PRINT PROHIBITED BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ANY INDIVIDUAL ON THE BASIS OF CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS SEX RACE AND NATIONAL ORIGIN. IN NINETY FIVE CALIFORNIA ELABORATED ON THE UNDER ACT BY ENACTING THE GENDER TAX REPEAL ACT BY SPECIFICALLY BOOK PROHIBITING BUSINESSES FROM CHARGING FEMALE CONSUMERS HIGHER PRICES. THAN MALE CONSUMERS FOR SERVICES OF A LIKE OR SIMILAR KIND UNLESS THE PRICE DIFFERENTIALS COULD BE JUSTIFIED ON NON DISCRIMINATORY GROUND SUCH AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME DIFFICULT- COST INVOLVED. THE GENDER REPEAL THE GENDER TAX REPEAL ACT WAS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. TOWARD GREATER ECONOMIC EQUITY FOR FEMALE CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA HOWEVER THAT ACTED NOT PREVENT BUSINESSES FROM CHARGING DISCRIMINATORY PRICES FOR GOODS AND I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT HERE BUT AS A RESULT IN TOO MANY INSTANCES. CALIFORNIA FEMALE CONSUMERS CONTINUE TO PAY MORE THAN MALE CONSUMERS FOR THE SAME PRODUCTS WE NOTE SB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE WOULD ADDRESS THE SHORT COMING IN THE LAW. AND FULLY REPEAL THE GENDER TAX. THE GATHERED BY THESE COMMITTEE CONSUMER PROTECTION GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SHOWS THE GENDER DISCRIMINATION AND PRICING RESULT IN EACH ADULT WOMAN IN THIS STATE PAYING A GENDER TAX OF APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. WOULD YOU MULTIPLY THAT OUT ACROSS A WOMAN'S WORKING LIFETIME. THEN THE TOTALS OVER NINETY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER FEMALE CONSUMER. NOW WE'RE FROM THE BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE SO IT'S EVEN LONGER JUST AS THE FEMALE CONSUMER FROM CRADLE TO GRAVE BUT- OUR CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE WAS. SHE'S A WORKING WOMAN OR AN ENTREPRENEUR FROM TWENTY TO SIXTY SO THAT'S FORTY YEARS AND THAT'S NINETY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THAT FEMALE BUSINESS OWNER. IS DIRECTLY IMPACTS WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN TERMS OF FUNDING THEIR OWN BUSINESSES. MULTIPLE STUDIES SHOW THAT WOMEN RECEIVE ONLY TWO POINT 2% OF THE ENSURE CAPITAL AND ANGEL FUNDING TWO POINT 2% SO MOST OF THE WOMEN HAVE TO FUND THEIR HELP PARTY AS WELL THE AVERAGE ALONG FOR WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES IS 31% LESS THE MALE OWNED BUSINESSES SO WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS OFTEN FUND THEIR NASCENT BUSINESSES AND THEY'RE GOING BUSINESSES OUT OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL FUNDS IN THEIR OWN POCKETS. 40% OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS PULL FROM THE PERSONAL SAVINGS FORTY PERCENT. AND FORTY SIX OF THEM USE THEIR PERSONAL CREDIT CARDS TO FUND THEIR BUSINESSES. IN THE QUEUE TO WILL BE TAKING OVER ON OUR UP THE BACK HALF OF OUR TIME. THANK YOU MS POINDEXTER. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I'M AS HILLARY INDICATED I AM PRESIDENT ELECT FOR NOVEL CALIFORNIA I AM CURRENTLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE AND WHEN EMPIRE. THE CLOSELY OF OUR. THE ONLY MOVIE BACK OVER OKAY. OKAY SO AGAIN I'M THE KING POINDEXTER IN THE PRESS ELECT FOR NOVEL CAL I AM THE OF THE INLAND EMPIRE I AM AND CEO APPOINT CONSULTING GROUP WHICH IS HEADQUARTERED IN TO MAKE CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO KIND OF. JUST REALLY TALK REALLY BRIEF REGARDING SOME CONCERNS THAT I HAVE REGARDING THIS RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS A GENDER PAY GAP IS RELEVANT HERE ACCORDING TO THE STUDY BY THE CENTER FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN AT MOUNT SAINT MARY'S UNIVERSITY THAT WAS JUST PUBLISHED RECENTLY IT IS TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REPORT ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN CALIFORNIA. WOMEN IN THIS STATE MAKE EIGHTY NINE CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR MEN EARN. AND AMONG WOMEN OF COLOR TO SPIRIT SEE IS MORE GLARING. FOR EACH DOLLAR EARNED BY OUR WHITE MALE COUNTERPARTS ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN EARN SEVENTY FIVE CENTS. AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN WE ARE SIXTY CENTS AND LATINA WOMEN AREN'T FORTY THREE PER SENSE. WHEN YOU FACTOR IN GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATORY TAXES THAT COSTS THE FEMALE CONSUMER AS HILLARY INDICATED AN AVERAGE OF NINETY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OVER HER WORKING LIFE TIME WITH GENDER PAY GAP. FEMALE CONSUMERS ARE FURTHER EQUITY CHALLENGE. CAUGHT IN A REALITY OF DISCRIMINATORY PRICING BEST SYSTEMICALLY AS SYSTEMATICALLY DEPRIVES WOMEN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT ANY FORM OF GENDER BASED TACK TAX UNDERMINES THE ABILITY OF WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS. TO COMPETE ON A LEVEL PLAYING GROUND. WE ARE PLEASED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE INITIAL CONVERSATIONS TO RECTIFY THIS AND ARRIVE AT A SOLUTION. THANK CLOSING WOULD LIKE TO PARAPHRASE THE TRAILBLAZING RBG. WE ASK NO FOR OUR GENDER. WELL WE- OF OUR IN IS THAT THEY TAKE FEET OFF OUR NECKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MUCH GREAT. HIS PEREIRA ARE THE XP REPRESENT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND- IF YOU WOULD LIKE- TEN MINUTES OR SO TO SPEAK WE ARE ALTHOUGH YOU SPEAK SO FAST MAYBE A SLOW DOWN SLOW TODAY YEAH RIGHT COULD. THREATEN MY LUXURY OF HAVING TEN MINUTES I'LL GO SLOW THREE- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS AND TO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE- I'M GOING TO- I FOR SIGNAL AJ THE GENDER PAY GAP WHICH HAS BEEN A CENTRAL FOCUS OF THIS DISCUSSION AND GIVEN THE GOOD WORK OF SENATOR JACKSON'S SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO PARTNER ON THAT. I JUST ALSO READ REPORT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE NARROWEST WAGE GAP OUT OF THE ENTIRE CUT SO KUDOS TO SENATOR JACKSON ON THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE'S STILL A DISCREPANCY SO I WANT TO MAKE A VERY IMPORTANT PART ON THAT LEGISLATION THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PARTNER TOGETHER GENDER THOUGH GENDER LEGISLATION THAT SHE COVERED DIDN'T SAY THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY HAD TO BE EQUAL PAY WITH NO FACTORS THERE IS BONA FIDE FACTORS UPON WHICH YOU COULD HAVE A DISCREPANCY. CENTS TO THE DOLLAR AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE THAT DISCREPANCY IS ACTUALLY BASED UPON BUT A FIGHT FACTORS SUCH AS YOUR LONGEVITY AT THE JOB SUCH AS EXPERIENCE SUCH AS EDUCATION AND THERE IS EVEN A DISCUSSION ABOUT GEOGRAPHICAL DIFFERENCES AND WHY THAT COULD JUSTIFY A WAGE DIFFERENCE AND THAT WASN'T GOING TO BE COMPLETELY EQUAL SO- THAT'S ONE ASPECT THAT I WANT TO DRESS BUT I'M ALSO GOING TO PUSH BACK ON. AND DISAGREE WITH SOME OF THE- POINTS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COMMENTS THAT THE GENDER PRICE IS DISCRIMINATION OR THAT IS A CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATION AND I WANT TO KIND OF PUSH BACK ON THAT NOTION FOR A MOMENT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT A SITUATION HERE IN WHICH I'M GOING UP TO THE REGISTER AND SENATOR HILL IS GOING UP TO THE REGISTER WITH THE PINK TEDDY BEAR. AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT ME IN THEIR SAME BECAUSE YOU'RE A WOMAN WE'RE GOING TO PAY OUR TO REUIRE YOU TO PAY TWO DOLLARS MORE FOR THAT EXACT SAME PRODUCT THAN SENATOR HILL NO WE'RE EACH PAIN THE EXACT SAME PRICE REGARDLESS OF OUR GENDER AND IT COMES DOWN TO WE CHOICE THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN A CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATION WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO A PLACE OF PUBLIC ACCOMMODATION AND THE OWNER OF THE BUSINESS THE SAME. BECAUSE OF YOUR GENDER YOU CANNOT YOU CANNOT HAVE SERVICE HERE BECAUSE OF YOUR GENDER MUCH LIKE A SENATOR EXCUSE ME MY RESPONSE WHO SAID BECAUSE OF YOUR CHEN ACTUALLY GOING TO OUR CHART PRICE THAT'S NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE GOODS IF YOU GO UP WITH THE EXACT SAME GOOD TO THE REGISTER REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU'RE MALE OR FEMALE YOU'RE BEING CHARGED THE SAME PRICE AND SO I HAVE A HARD TIME ACCEPTING THAT THIS IS DISCRIMINATION IN THE NORMAL WAY IN WHICH WE USE THAT TERM. OR THAT IT'S A CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATED BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF YOUR GENDER YOU'RE PAYING THE SAME PRICE IT COMES DOWN TO CHOICE THE OTHER NOTION THAT ALL PUSH BACK ON A LITTLE BIT IS IT WITH REGARDS TO EVEN LABELING THE SUBPOENA AXE REINFORCING STEREO TYPES AT THE GROUP OF US TALKED ABOUT THAT PINK IS FOR GIRLS AND LOUIS FOR. A KIND OF. IT YEAH. I HAVE A- OF TIME. WE HEARD WE HEARD TO IN TO I THINK IT REINFORCES OUT DAY NOTION IN THOSE DATE IF TIE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN IS. WITH THE SPUR GENDER AND SO WE'RE BASICALLY SO THAT ANY CAN HAS TO BE PRICED AT THE SAME AS A BELOW WHICH IS A VERY CA. NO THAT WERE RE AND THOSE TO TYPES IN OUR MARKET I ALSO WANT TO PUSH ON THE NEW. OF A OF THAT THIS S NOT IN THE SENSE OF THERE'S AN UNDERMINING. THAT A FEMALE CONSUMER IS NOT EDUCATED ENOUGH TO MAKE A CONSCIOUS DECISION ABOUT WHICH PRODUCT THEY'RE GOING TO PURCHASE I AGREE MOST WOMEN ARE THE CFO'S OF THEIR FAMILIES AND CFO'S OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD AND THEY ARE MAKING THE MAJORITY OF THE PURCHASES. BUT THEY'RE ALSO EXTREMELY EDUCATED AND THEY'RE ALSO WOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT MY INCOME IS WORTH THAT PRODUCT WHETHER OR NOT I'M WILLING TO PAY THAT AMOUNT FOR THAT SPECIFIC PRODUCT AND IT REALLY IT COMES DOWN TO IT BUT THE PINK FREEZERS EXACT SAME AS THE BLUE RAZOR. AND I DON'T GET THAT PRICE THE CONCERT I HAVE THAT CHOICE I'M AT EIGHT IN THIS TICKET ENOUGH TO DETERMINATION AS A CONSUMER SO I PUSH BACK ON THAT OKAY CAN WE TALK TO NEW YORK'S. THE STATE THAT A WITH THINK IT AS ENERGY MENTIONED PROXIMAL. PRODUCTS THE MARKETPLACE COMPARISON. THE PRISON AT THOSE ARE I AM I DO THAT IN THE DIFFERENCE AND DISTINCTIONS THAT YOU CAN EVEN TELL JUST FROM THE AT THE OF THE FOR A- I THINK THERE WAS LIKE A COMPARISON OF TO SKI JEANS ONE. HI ENOUGH THE OTHER LIKE I WOULD THE DOW SOMETHING SOME BILLS ON THE TOOLS FOR WILL PROBABLY COST MORE. AS FAR AS BIRD AND MATERIALS AND IT WAS PURPOSE TO FOR. NONE THE LESS LET'S JUST ASSUME ALL THOSE PRODUCTS ARE SAME MY- IS THAT THAT WAS TAKEN IN WE NOT SHOT OF MARKET OUT. IN THE MARK. BUT OVER THE- AIR MARK. NOT WHAT IN THOSE THOSE PROP AT THAT TIME ONE MAY HAVE BEEN HIGHER THE OTHER BUT IF YOU LOOK AT A COUPLE FROM THERE MAYBE THE PRICE FLEX SO WHY THOSE WHAT AND WHAT HOW WITH THE FUNCTION WELL THERE'S A VERY OF READY REASONS THAT GO INTO THE PRICING FOR THE MANY IT CAN BE THE THAT ARE PURCHASE IT CAN BE TERRACE AS WE'VE SEEN YOUR ABILITY TO GET PRODUCTS FROM OTHER FROM IMPORTING FROM OTHER COUNTRIES CAN BE EVENT SUCH AS A WHAT PARENTS IN OVER IN CHINA WITH THE CORONA. LEAD TO GET ACCESS. THIRTY PRICE START. TENS ON HOW MY PURCHASE OF THAT'S MATERIAL SO PRODUCTS AMMAR OF SKILL IF IT'S A MARK OF SCALING YOUR PURCHASE A LARGE THE- THEN IT'S GOING TO BE TO THAN A YOUR PURCHASE AS MARK OF SCALE IT GOES INTO ANGRY FOR. CAN IN A DISH INGREDIENTS THAT IS MORE APPEALING TO THE CONSUMER AND ALSO COST MORE TO INCLUDE PACKED. SB THREE CURRENT DOESN'T ALLOW PACKAGING AS A PER TO. A KEY COST MORE MARKETING ADVERTISING ON A SPECIFIC PRODUCT ALL OF THOSE COSTS ARE ARE PUT INTO THE FINAL COST THAT THE MANUFACTURER MAY PROVIDE TO THE RETAILER. AND THEN YOU GET IT TO THE RETAIL AND WHAT ARE THE COST AND FACTORS IN THAT. IT CAN BE ON YOUR INVENTORY IF YOU HAVE A HIGH INVENTORY AT SOMETHING IN A LOW INVENTORY ON ANOTHER THING THAT WILL IMPACT THE PRICE. IF YOU'RE RUNNING SALES IF YOU'RE RUNNING COUPONS IF YOU HAVE DIFFERENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE IN THE IN THE RETAIL WITH REGARDS TO THE PRODUCTS OFFER YOU'RE GOING TO THAT WILL IMPACT THE- PRICE AND SO YOU. OF ALL THESE FLUCTUATIONS OF PRICE SECOND HAPPEN OVER THE ENTIRE MARKET CYCLE SO TO ONE NOW. OF THE MARKET AND HEY BE A PROBLEM FOR MORE ACTIVE ALSO CONCERNING THEIR FEDERAL STUDIED WAS JUST FINISHED A- PUBLISHED IN AUG. OF TWO EIGHTEEN I BELIEVE WHERE THEY ALSO LOOK AT ABOUT TEN PERSONAL OR PRODUCTS. AND THEY DIDN'T OVER TWO WEEKS SO A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN WHAT I BELIEVE THE NEW YORK STUDY WAS AND THE TO YORK CYCLE. SHOW THAT PRODUCTS WHICH WOULD LABEL AS FOR MEL. THEY WERE TIRED ALSO MAILED SEPARATE TIRE AND THEN THERE WERE ROLE THAT. THE REAL DIFFERENCE. I BUT THERE. BE IN A- OVER TOP. THE PRODUCT PLAY TO WHICH THIS PROPOSAL WOULD APPLY AND HOW THE WOULD WORK I THE OTHER POINT I WON TO TALK IS THE IN MECHANISM WHICH CENTER JACK'S AND I OFF DISAGREE UPON THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ON WITH COME. SPEAR OF HER BILL WHICH IS THE GENDERS SO TO ELECT AND THAT IS KERN ENFORCED UNDER CIVIL CODE FIFTY TWO WHERE OUT OUR STATUTE AND IT PROVIDES THAT YOU CAN BRING A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WITH A MINIMUM OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS STATUTORY DAMAGES MEANING THAT EVEN IF THERE IS A PENNY DIFFERENCE IN THE PRICE. THE MINIMUM AMOUNT YOU IS FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THERE IS A DISCUSSION OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAS BEEN LOCATION THERE HAS. IT WAS A VERY FAMOUS ACTUALLY ARE WIDELY REPORTED ISSUE DOWN IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. IN WHICH- AN ATTORNEY AND HIS GIRLFRIEND TARGETED FIVE MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES DRY CLEANERS HAIR STYLISTS. AND WHEN IN THERE AND PURCHASE THE SERVICES. AND THE I BELIEVE AT THE DRY CLEANER ALTHOUGH I WILL VERIFY IT WAS A TWENTY FIVE CENT DIFFERENCE AND THEY ASK FOR OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS- WITH THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION NOW. THOSE CASES THEY WERE LITIGATED FOUND AN ATTORNEY TO. OUT IN THE ATTORNEY WHO FILED THOSE CASES WAS ULTIMATELY PUT IN JAIL WHICH IS GREAT. NONE THE LESS THE OTHER STATION WAS FILED IN THE- WAS PRESENTED. THERE'S A PUBLISHED CASES IN EACH. OF OUR WALMART CASE A MALE CUSTOMER NGUYEN IN AND ASKED FOR AN OIL SO. OIL CHANGE THAT DATE ON A- DAY WHEN THEY'RE PROVIDING ACTUALLY A DISCOUNT TO WOMEN FOR OLD. AND THEY FILED A LAWSUIT AND THE GENDER SERVICES TAX REPEAL LACKS AND IT WAS UNFAIR AND DISCRIMINATORY. TO THE MEN THAT THE WOMEN WERE GETTING A DISOUNT THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE WITH REGARDS TO A GOLF COURSE WHERE THEY ARE AGAIN PROVIDING A LADIES DAY OPPORTUNITY THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE WITH REGARDS TO A DATING SITE IN WHICH THEY'RE PROVIDING. A DISCOUNTED SERVICE RATE FOR WOMEN VERSUS MEN AND SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE SUBJUGATION. IS THAT ANYBODY CAN FILE THE LAWSUIT SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE EXAMPLE OF THE PINK RESERVE VERSUS THE BLUE RESEARCH. LET'S SEE IN THAT EXAMPLE THE BLUE RAZOR WAS CAUGHT. HIGHER PRICE IN THE PANCREAS. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THE MAIL COULD GO IN THROUGH THE RETAILER IN SAY I WAS CHARGED. YOUR PRICE FOR THE MY BLUE RAZOR WHICH IS MALE AND SO I SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE ENTITLED TO A MINIMUM OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT'S A HUGE CONCERN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IN THAT FEDERAL STUDY THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE. THERE'S OTHER JURISDICTIONS WHO HAVE ENACTED SIMILAR TYPE LEGISLATION THEY MENTION CALIFORNIA REGARD THE CHEN TAX. REPEAL ACT MIAMI DADE COUNTY I BELIEVE- ALSO HAS A LOT WITH REGARDS TO JURORS TO. IN FOR BY AGO AGING. DO I'M- IN IT TO WIN I TAKE. NEST EITHER THOSE OF FOR PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. REBUTTALS TO THAT- IN LOOK FOR TO THAT OPPORTUNITY BUT LET US FINISH WITH OUR- NEXT SPEAKER WHO IS NATASHA META. FROM BOX DOT COM. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THE SIX MINUTES IF YOU CUT. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF FOR PROVIDING THIS OPPORTUNITY- FOR ME TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS NATASHA **** AND I AM A MARKETING DIRECTOR AT FOX IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF BOX WE ARE THE ONLINE AND MOBILE VERSION OF THE WHOLE SO SHOPPING CLUB BUT WITH NO MEMBERSHIP FEES AND FREE SHIPPING. WE A HELP OUR CUSTOMERS SAVE TIME AND MONEY AND WILL EVEN DELIVER A BOOK SIZE ESSENTIALS TO CALIFORNIA IN TWO DAYS. EQUALITY IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND ALL OF US THAT BOX AND THAT IS THE REASON WE DECIDED TO TAKE A STAND AND LAUNCH OUR RETHINK PINK INITIATIVE AND IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. QUITE FRANKLY I WAS FED UP WITH THE GLARING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN WHO WERE FORCED TO PAY HIGHER PRICES FOR THE SAME PRODUCTS. SO WE TOOK A HARD LOOK AT SOME OF THE PRODUCTS OFFERED ON THE BOX. AND REALIZE THAT MANY FEMALE PRODUCTS COST SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THEIR MALE EQUIVALENTS MADE BY THE SAME MANUFACTURER THE SAME BRANDS. ON A PER ALLEN'S ARE PER UNIT BASIS. THIS IS BASED ON THE COSTS THAT WE RECEIVE THAT WE RETAILERS RECEIVE FROM RESERVE CREATED BY THE SAME MANUFACTURER MAY COST AT TWO HUNDRED AND 8% MORE. ON A PER UNIT BASIS FOR THE FEMALE VERSION VERSES THE MALE VERSION. EVEN THOUGH THE MEN'S RAZOR MAY BE SHARPER AND THAT AND THE BLADE MAYBE A BETTER QUALITY. WHEN I INITIALLY BUT AT THIS ISSUE TO OUR FOR CO FOUNDERS FOR MEN- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY OR HOW THIS COULD BE THE CASE BACK. FOUR YEARS AGO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. ARE CHAU CHE WAN WAS JUST AS SHOCKED AS I WAS TO LEARN ABOUT THESE PRICING DISCREPANCIES. HE HIMSELF HAS A YOUNG DAUGHTER AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY OR HOW SHE WOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE ON ESSENTIAL ITEMS. THROUGHOUT HER LIFETIME THAT HER MALE FRIENDS WOULD HAVE TO. AND SO WITHIN TWO WEEKS AND WITH THE ENTIRE COMPANY SUPPORT.BOX DECIDED TO TAKE A STAND AND LOWER PRICES ON WOMEN'S PRODUCTS THAT HAD A SIGNIFICANT COST VARIANCE VERSES THEIR MALE EQUIVALENT. AS WELL AS REDUCE OUR PRICES ON TAMPONS AND PADS IN AN EFFORT TO OFFSET THE SALES TAX EVEN IF THIS MEN'S TAKING AHEAD ON MARGIN. AS A RESULT THE BOX BECAME THEFIRST AND ONLY NATIONAL RETAILER TO TAKE A STAND ON GENDER PRICING INEQUITIES. WE WERE THE ONLY ONE TO DO SO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TODAY IN TWENTY TWENTY WE ARE STILL THE ONLY NATIONAL RETAILER TAKING A STAND. SINCE WE'VE LAUNCHED WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF VISITORS TO OUR LANDING PAGE AND ART EDUCATION- HAVE HAD TENS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW CUSTOMERS SIGN UP FOR A BOX AS A RESULT OF OUR INITIATIVE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE'VE PASS OVER ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF SAVINGS BACK BRANDS HAVE LAUNCHED IN RESPONSE TO THE PAYING TAX AND OUR HOPE IS THAT BRANDS LIKE BEES WILL CONTINUE TO GAIN STEAM AND PUT PRESSURE ON LARGER MANUFACTURERS THAT STILL PARTICIPATE IN GENDER PRICING DISCRIMINATION. BILL IS SO CRITICAL FOR HOLDING THESE LARGER MANUFACTURERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR CHANGING DISCRIMINATORY PRICING ONCE AND FOR ALL. CALIFORNIA HAS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ONE OF THE LEADERS TO PUSH FORWARD BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THIS INDUSTRY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AND THANK YOU- I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY TO GET STARTED OR WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO START. AGO OKAY KOKO HEAD THAT WELL- LET LET ME START WITH YOU MS MADE UP. YOU KNOW VERY INTERESTING ID WE HEAR AND WE HEARD FROM OUR GOOD FRIENDS AT THE CHAMBER ABOUT HOW. YOU KNOW WOMEN. WE WERE SOPHISTICATED BUYERS AND WE SHOULD KNOW WHEN WE'RE MAKING A CHOICE- IN YOUR EXPERIENCES THAT ACTUALLY ACCURATE. IT'S A YES OF COURSE WOMEN- SOPHISTICATED BUYERS BUT THESE ITEMS ARE NOT NECESSARILY NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND SO WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THAT AND I'LL IT ARE YOUR GROCERY STORE YOU EAT YOUR RETAILER. THE WOMEN'S RAZORS ARE NOT OFTEN RIGHT NEXT TO THE MEN'S VERSION AND SO. WOMEN ARE NOT COMPARING THOUGH WOMEN'S VERSIONS VERSUS THE MALE VERSION THAT THEY WERE THEY PROBABLY WOULD USE THAT CHEAPER OPTIONS BUT GENERALLY IF THOSE OPTIONS ARE NOT PRESENTED TO THEM. CLEAR AWAY EITHER IN STORE OR ONLINE EITHER I'M AT I NEED THE OTHER ASPECT OF THAT IS MARKETING AS WELL AND SO IS SPECIFIC BRANDS ARE MARKETED TO WOMEN IS NOT NECESSARILY THE PAYING FOR SINS BLUE BUT THE SPECIFIC BRAND OF RAZOR IS THAT IS MARKETED TO WOMEN THAT IS USED BY WOMEN. IN THEIR ADS VERSES SIMILARLY A TARGETED AT MEN'S RATE THAT ARE TARGETED TO MATT AND SO. CONSUMERS NO- AND SEE THESE PRODUCTS- AND ASSOCIATE THEM WITH MALE VERSUS FEMALE SO HOW DOES BOXED A DOT COM DETERMINE WHEN TWO PRODUCTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR ENOUGH THAT A PINK TAX DISCOUNT IS WARRANTED AND HAVE AN A MANUFACTURES EVER CHALLENGE THAT DETERMINATION NO WE ACTUALLY WE A PURCHASE THESE PRODUCTS FROM OUR MANUFACTURERS AT A COSTS AND THEY HAVE COME TO REALIZE THAT THEY DO HAVE PRICING DISCRIMINATION FROM THEIR COSTS ON THEIR SIDE AS WELL AND MANY OF THEM HAVE SUPPORTED US- EITHER THROUGH DONATIONS ETCETERA BECAUSE THEY ARE UNABLE TO CHANGE THE COSTS ON THEIR END BUT THEY DO WANT TO SUPPORT. OUR INITIATIVE- SO HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHEN THOSE TWO THOSE TWO PRODUCTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO GIVE THAT THAT DISCOUNT THE WILL LOOK AT THE PRODUCTS COSTS ON EITHER PER UNITS ARE PER OUNCE BASIS AND SO IT IS THE SAME FACTURE THAT IS PRODUCING TO THE SAME VERY SIMILAR ITEMS- AS LONG AS THEY ARE SIMILAR IN NATURE IN TERMS OF ZERO USE- DISPOSABLE VERSUS NOT AS LONG WHAT WE WILL AND CONSIDER THAT BALANCES ARE A UNITS- THAT PACKAGING AND THE TERM DETERMINE. WHETHER THE NEEDS IT JUST SAID SO WITH TO. YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH A MAN HAVE EVER BEEN ABLE TO THEM OUT OF TRYING TO PASS ALONG THESE. DESPARD SIS YEAR CUSTOMERS OR IN GENERAL SO SINCE WE A LAUNCHER INITIATIVE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE NO LONGER A SORTS ARE BRING ON ANY ITEMS I DO YOU HAVE PRICING DISCRIMINATION OUR GENDER PRICING DISCRIMINATION AND SO WE ACTUALLY WORKED WITH A- POPULAR BRANDS- THAT BROUGHT US TO OPTIONS OF BODY WASH ONE- WOMEN'S BODY WASH- AND- ONE WAS A MEN'S VERSION. OF THE SAME BODY WASH- THAT HAD SEPARATE COSTS AND WE A I ASKED THE MANUFACTURE WHY THEY THEY WERE PRICED SEPARATELY AND THEY COULDN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR US. AND THEY ENDED UP GIVING US THE SAME COSTS FOR BOTH. INTERESTING SO- LAST QUESTION- HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHEN A PRODUCT IS BEING MARKETED TO TWO WOMEN IN PARTICULAR ANOTHER WORKS. WHAT IF A MANUFACTURER'S CHARGING DIFFERENT PRICES FOR WHAT APPEAR TO BE THE SAME PRODUCT. BUT THERE'S NO BASIS FOR THINKING THAT THE DIFFERENCES BASED ON GENDER. THOUGH SOME MARKETING ITSELF AND GENERALLY IT'S A SOMEONE WHO IS CHAU HUNT IN THOSE IN THAT MARKETING TELL SENATE. OF THE LARGEST ADAM. AND ALL HER NAME. AS WELL THERE'S- SOCIAL CHANNELS AND IT WHO IS AT HIS. THANK OUR A PART IN THOSE I DEAF MEDIA. AS WELL AS WHO THERE'S TO AND SO IF THERE SHOWING A WOMAN BIRCH AND SHE HER LAN VERSUS A MALE SHE HIS THAT IS A PRETTY. SIGNIFICANT AS PRETTY TARGETED POINT TO. GENDER AND ESOS WITH THAT HEY. THAT'S CORRECT I THINK OF IT ON TV SEEING A RAZOR WITH THE WOMAN OF NICE. OF RAZOR IN A PAIR OF LEGS SHAVING- AND THEN YOU GET THE MAN WITH THE SCRUFFY BEARD AND ALL IN THAT RAZORS DEFINITELY NOT PINK HEY YEAH- ALTHOUGH THE ONE FOR THE WOMEN IN THIS YEAH- SO- ALL RIGHT A ANY QUESTIONS FOR MS MADE. BUT ONE OF THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORT AND I'M JUST WANTING IT YOU MENTION THERE ARE NO OTHER COMPANIES THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT ARE DOING THE SAME THING NATIONAL RETAILERS THAT. THAT ARE DOING THIS TODAY OUR GOAL IS TO GET OTHER NATIONAL RETAILERS ON BOARD WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WILL TAKE. AS SUPPORT FOR MANUFACTURERS TODAY WE ARE TAKING AHEAD ON MARGIN- WHICH IS. AS WHICH IS THE MAIN ROAD BLOCK FOR OTHER RETAILERS TO GET ON BOARD. SO SUPPORT SO IF WE WERE TO SAY TO MANUFACTURERS AT SOME LAWFUL- YOU AND TO YOU YOU KNOW THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO THAT YOU THINK THAT THAT WOULD. ABSOLUTELY HAVE AN IMPACT THANK. ALRIGHT WELL I WANTED TO ASK HIM IS BARRERA- ALWAYS TEMPTING TO. ENGAGE YOUR BUT VERY BRIEFLY- YOU KNOW YOU ARTICULATED A FEW REASONS THE BONA FIDE FACTORS AND WE DID THERE'S WE DO THIS AND EQUAL PAY BECAUSE IF THERE ARE JUSTIFICATIONS THAT ARE NON GENDER BASED THEIR LEGITIMATE- BUT THE GENDER BASED pDISCRIMINATION IS NOT LEGITIMATE. I HEAR IN THE SITUATION WITH THE PAIN TAX- YOU INDICATE THINGS LIKE TERRORISTS ADVANCE MARKET OF SCALE THINGS OF THAT SORT THE INGREDIENTS. I DON'T THINK WE'RE I DON'T THINK THAT WERE SAYING THAT THAT THOSE AREN'T LEGITIMATE. DIFFERENCES I THINK WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WHEN THERE IS REALLY NO. GERMAN DIFFERENCE OR THAT YOU. MAKE THE PINK PROP THE PACKAGING THE PINK PRODUCT A LITTLE FANCIER BECAUSE YOU WANT TO ATTRACT WOMEN TO IT. THAT THAT IS A GENDER BASIS AND THAT WOULD BE UNLAWFUL SO- ASSUMING THAT WERE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THAT THAT THAT THERE ARE BONA FIDE FACTORS AND I THINK THAT THE WEEK WE ALL AGREE WITH THAT- WHAT IS YOUR OTHER OBJECTION TO- PROHIBITING THIS KIND OF GENDER. GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION. WELL I THINK IF WE GET I THINK. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BONAFIDE FACTORS IN THE WAY IF WE CAN JUST RELATE TO SB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE. YES I ALWAYS SWITCH THE NUMBERS ARE EIGHT SEVENTY THREE- WITH THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND IF WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT WITH A MINIMUM OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DAMAGES AND HOW THAT GOES INTO THE BONA FIDE FACTORS IF YOU'LL JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT. THE BONA FIDE FACTORS THAT'S ALL ONE. WHEN I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE DETERMINE WHAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR AND I THINK THAT'S A HUGE CHALLENGE AND THE PERSPECTIVE LOOK OF A CONSUMER WHEN WE'RE SITTING HERE TALKING ABOUT. IF THE CONSUMER IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS AND LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT PACKAGING AND BEING ABLE TO TELL WHETHER THEY'RE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR AND NOT WHEN IT'S SUGGESTED THEY WON'T EVEN GO FROM MILE TO I'LL DO COMPARISON I THINK IS A HUGE PROBLEM. WHEN CAN BE THE ENFORCERS. BUT WE SAY OKAY. THERE'S ACTUALLY SENT WHERE YOU CAN HAVE A PER DIFFERENCE BASED ON BOTH BUT FACT RATED AS YOU MAY YOU LISTED THOSE OUT HERE'S THE CHALLENGE. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THE MINIMUM FOR THAT DOLLARS IF THE ELDER PLANE. AND THEY SAY. IS THE SAME AS THE BLU RAY. AND I PAID FOR CENTS. AN THEY FOUND THAT LOS. AGAIN THE RETAILER LEGISLATOR RETAILER BECAUSE THAT'S THE PER WHO THE- MOST LIKELY INTERACTS WITH RATE- THE RETAILERS GOING TO LOOK AT THAT. AND SAY I CAN GO OUT AND HIRE AN ATTORNEY TO DEFEND ME. FOR LET'S AT A CHEAP DEFENSE FOR ALL THE WAY THROUGH TROUT WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I CAN GO IMPAIR ATTORNEY TO DO THAT RIGHT AND PAID THE DEFENSE. OR I CAN SIT HERE IN NEGOTIATING PAY THE MINIMUM FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND PAY OFF THE SETTLEMENT AND SETTLE THE CLAIM NOW. THEY HAVE A BONA FIDE FACTOR OF COURSE YOU WOULD WANT TO GO AND DEFEND YOURSELF. OR BUT WHEN YOU LOOKING THAT. THIS DECISION. YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A MOMENT AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOUSANDS OF GOODS IN THE MARKET PLACE. JUST HAVE BEEN. TODAY AT THE- BILL TO. THREE PRODUCT IN THE- PLACE. THAT'S A CONCERN FOR A LOT OF BUSINESSES SO JUST TO RESPOND BRIEFLY TO THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE MEMBERS UP HERE OR IN PERSON THAT CONCEPT. WE HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION NOW IN THE INTERESTS OF RIGHTS ACT IT'S BEEN THERE SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY NINE. YOU YOU REFERRED TO- NOTORIOUS A COUPLE IN- ORANGE COUNTY WHEN. SO WE TOOK CARE THAT PRETTY IN. IN THAT LAWYER. LOST HIS. YOU KNOW LOST HIS TICKET CAN NOT ONLY NO LONGER PRACTICE LAW. ABOUT TO IS NOW IN PRISON- WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS THAT MOST OF THE DECISION MAKING. IS DONE AT THE MANUFACTURER'S LEVEL- SO IT WON'T BE JUST AN ISOLATED INCIDENT- AND- IS WE- HAVE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THESE. OTHER ISSUES WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE. AN A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND A EQUITY LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. WE HAVEN'T SEEN A VAST NUMBER OF LAWSUITS. FROM ANYWHERE. SO I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THINK THAT THAT OPENS THE FLOODGATES. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THE- THE HISTORY. OF ANY OF OUR EQUALITY EFFORTS HAVE GENERATED THAT. THE REALITY THAT YOU FEAR SO LET US ASSUME FOR THE MOMENT. THAT YOU SAY THERE'S A MINIMUM OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH ACTION. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A MANUFACTURER WHO'S MAKING. THE OR SELLING THOUSANDS OF THESE ITEMS. SO THAT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS MAY BE VIEWED BY SOME OF THESE COMPANIES AS A COSTS DOING BUSINESS- AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR PRODUCT. AGAIN I AND WE DID THIS THE COPAY YOU YOU WEIGH THEM LET'S SAY HAVE A OF PERFUME VERSUS AMEND COLOGNE. AND YOU USE. DIFFERENT PRODUCTS IN THEM. BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY PRODUCTS THE COST THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY. SHOULD YOU BE ABLE TO CHARGE MORE FOR THE WOMAN'S PRODUCT VERSUS THE MANS I WOULD POSIT NOW. IF ONE OF THE IF THE COST OF THE ITEM IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAT'S A JUSTIFICATION BUT WHAT WE SEE AND I KNOW THIS IS TRUE IN SOME INSTANCES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN'S COLOGNE AND WOMEN'S PERFUME. IS THE PACKAGING. BUT THE COST IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. IN IN MANY INSTANCES- SO AGAIN THIS WILL REQUIRE. A COMPANIES TO GO BACK AND REVIEW THE DECISION MAKING PRACTICES THEY HAVE. ARE ARE YOU SUGGESTING THE COMPANY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS OR SHOULDN'T BE. THAT IT WOULD BE TOO BURDENSOME ON COMPANIES TO DO THIS NOW I LOOK WHAT I'LL SUGGEST IN JUST SICK KIND OF ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT YOU- JUST PRESENTED BACK ON THE LITIGATION FOR A MOMENT. WE HAVE SEEN THE LITIGATION BECAUSE THE OTHER CODE SECTION THAT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS STATUE OR STATUTORY DAMAGES THAT'S ALSO THE CODE SECTION THAT ENFORCES THE ACCESSIBILITY- CASES THAT WE HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE STATE HIT SMALL BUSINESS IN PARTICULAR. AND THERE'S A MINOR MINOR VIOLATIONS WITH REGARDS TO A DOOR HANDLE WHICH I APPRECIATE THE INTENT AND THE AND THE NEED FOR DISABILITY ACCESS I'M NOT SUGGESTING IN ANY WAY THAT THAT'S NOT. A SIGNIFICANT RIGHT BUT WHAT WE SEE IS AGAIN THIS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WITH A MINIMUM OF FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DAMAGES BEING UTILIZED TO LEVERAGE QUICK SETTLEMENTS FROM THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHY DISAGREED THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT HISTORY. AND EXAMPLES OF THE LAW TO BE. WITH REPORTS TO CODES AND THAT EIGHT SEP THREES. TO SURE SHOULD TO MAKE THESE DETERMINE WITH REGARDS TO PRICING BASED UPON GEN. I DON'T THINK THAT AN ALICE THAT GOES THE MANY. TODAY AND I THINK THAT IF YOU WERE TO HAVE A MANUFACTURER SITTING UP HERE IN TESTIFYING INSANE WHAT IS THE REASON WHY YOU'RE CHARGING AN X. AMOUNT AMOUNT. FOR THIS PROJECT IN A DIFFERENT AMOUNT FOR THIS PROJECT THERE WOULD BE A LIST OF COST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE INGREDIENTS CAN BE DIFFERENT I DON'T KNOW THAT MEN'S COLOGNE IS THE SAME AS WOMEN'S COLOGNE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT AND FRAGRANCES AND SO I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON. HOW IT'S MADE BUT THE INGREDIENTS AND GOT TO BE DIFFERENT BUT SECONDLY- THE MARKETING THAT GOES INTO IT ADVERTISING THAT GOES INTO IT THAT'S ALL OF COSTS AS A PART OF IT AND- MAYBE. MY SECOND I PUT A HIGHER. PRICE OR A HIGH VALUE ON PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAN MEN DO I'M SURE THAT MAY BE A TENDER STEREO TYPE THAT I JUST ASSERTED BUT I HAVE TO BELIEVE TO SOME EXTENT THAT'S TRUE MAYBE I'M WILLING AT THE CONSUMER. TO PAY A HIGHER AMOUNT FOR A CERTAIN PRODUCT A CERTAIN BRAND A CERTAIN SMELL A CERTAIN FRAGRANCE BECAUSE AS A CONSUMER I VALUE THAT BUT THEN PERHAPS AMANDA SO. THAT'S OF ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IF I AM PLEASED. THREE I IT AND I'LL TRY AND BE MORE. I THINK WE WILL OTHER OF MANY OTHER UP. TO CAN. THIS CALL. ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE AGAIN. PART OF THIS LEGISLATION IS TO MAKE- COMPANIES MANUFACTURERS MORE AWARE OF THESE DIFFERENTIALS AND TO TAKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT THIS KIND OF. A DISCRIMINATION AND PRICING IS NOT ACCEPTABLE SO WE WILL CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR TO RISE- THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR- FOR COMING AND BEING A PART OF THIS. I REALLY APPRECIATE- THE REMARKS BY THE CESSATION NOT NOVEL- THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH ABOUT FOR CONNECTING WITH. THIS ISSUE ABOUT THE PRODUCTS TO THE BROADER ISSUE. WOMEN IN BUSINESS AND- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES WE CAN GET TO IN THE WEEDS TOO MUCH IN THE DETAIL OF WHAT PRODUCT OR ONE. VERY SMALL PROBLEM AND THEN WE IGNORE WHAT'S GOING ON MORE BROADLY. AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE KIND OF LEARNED TODAY IS THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION WITHOUT THIS PANEL I WOULD NOT HAVE MADE THE CONNECTIO BACK TO. YOU KNOW THE PAY GAP AND OTHER THINGS ACCESS TO CAPITAL AS YOU ALL ARE TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF WOMEN- TO GET INTO OF THE BUSINESSES THAT THAT YOU REPRESENTS SO- I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT AND- I THINK ALSO WITH- IS MET MATHIS. MISS METHOD- IS IT COULD DOES TO YOU FOR HAVING YOUR COMPANY FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO DO THIS AND TAKE IT ON. I GUESS- AND I ALSO MISSED IT I APPRECIATE. WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE IT IT SEEMS TO ME THOUGH THAT. WITH THIS ONE SMALL STUDY IT HAS IDENTIFIED SO MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND JUST OUR OWN SORT OF DAY TO DAY I REALLY WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS LIKE I DO I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE SUCH DIFFERENCES IN PRICES- AND YOU KNOW I CONSIDER MYSELF I TRY TO READ I TRY TO STAY ON TOP OF ISSUES OF FEMINIST AT. NIGHT OF IT'S REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING ON RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES SO. I GUESS HOW. HOW DO WE I THIS PARTICULAR LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL FOR EXAMPLE MS BUT IT IS- THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH ENCOURAGING LITIGATION THAT YOU MIGHT BE SAYING. THERE IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM HERE AND- AS WOMEN AS MEN AND WOMEN. WERE CONSCIOUS OF TRYING TO EQUALIZE OURSELVES IN SOCIETY. WE WANT OUR- DAUGHTERS AND I WILL MY GRANDDAUGHTERS I JUST TEXTED MY SON LIKE SOME OF THE PICTURES I SAID DO YOU KNOW WHAT. WE NOT BECAUSE I KNOW I LIVE IT EVERY DAY. HE'S GOT TWO GIRLS BUT- AND I'M JUST KIND OF RAMBLING BUT IT'S HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS. BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT THERE IT'S RIGHT THERE SO THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY OF ADDRESSING. THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES. AND COME UP WITH A WAY OF EITHER PUSHING OUR EXAMPLE OF. IN I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR OF COMPANIES WHO WHO DO THIS. SO I REALLY QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY HAS A COMMON AND RESPOND BUT BASICALLY I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR THANK BETTER CHAIR AND THE I WHICH FOLLOW SENATOR DIRAJA MOW IT AND SHE ALWAYS ASK THE GREAT QUESTIONS THAT I WAS THINKING OF BUT I WANTED TO GET BACK TO AND I AGREE WITH THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THE ISSUES RELATED TO THAT IN THE ABUSES THAT WE'VE SEEN SPECIALLY WITH ADA COMPLIANCE AND THAT THE- SOME OF THE USES OF THAT AND HOW THAT HAS BEEN APPLIED AND- IN JUST TO. IT IT'S BEEN SAID BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THE- THOSE- CULPRITS THOSE WHO HAVE ABUSED THIS THAT AND THE AND I THINK WE NEED TO SEE MORE OF THAT ENFORCEMENT. BUT BUT THAT IS A CHALLENGE FOR ME AND PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT I DO YOU DON'T WIN IN THE STUDIES ON THIS THE- LITTLE. SHOWER SHOES THAT WE SAW THE- THEIR THIRD IT DOES SEEM TO BE A PERVASIVE PROBLEM. AND IN THAT FROM GOING WITH SENATOR ROGERS IF THERE DOES SEEM TO BE AN ISSUE HERE RELATEDTO. TO THE COST DIFFERENTIAL THAT COMES FROM WHAT TO EAT BUT- I GUESS WHAT I'M NOT SEEN AND WE HAVE THIS CERTAINLY AND I DID LOOK THROUGH THIS A LITTLE MORE DETAIL. LEFT THE COMPANY FROM. BUT THE SOME OF OUR- PRODUCTS THEY'RE NOT THE SAME MORE SHIRTS SOME ARE ON SALE SUMMER NOT. BUT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO THERE HAVE BEEN A- KIND OF A- IN THE- NOW. OF LOOK AT THE. THIS IF THERE. BEEN THIS DISC. PRETTY IT. I MEAN THE I DON'T KNOW. HOW YOU CAN CALL IT ANYTHING. THAT INTER OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE SEEN IN AT THAT WERE BE EITHER AND- TO BE ABLE TO. TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMS AND- THEN LOOK AT WHAT THAT MOTIVATION HAS BEEN AND HOW IT WORKS AND THEN WE CAN I THINK CORRECTED BECAUSE THERE HAS TO BE A WAY. AROUND THIS TO MEAN THE COST THE DOLLAR THE- HELP CONSUMERS PAIN- IS- IS OUTRAGEOUS FOR IF YOU LOOK AT THAT FROM THE DIFFERENCES SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN SEE THAT THE- THE DATA. AND THEN DETERMINE IF IT IS A PROBLEM THAT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED I MEAN FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN IT IS A PROBLEM BUT I'D BE NICE. TO HAVE SOME TO GO BY. THE CENTER IN LET ME REFER YOU TO THE BACKGROUND PAPER THAT DOES SIDE A NUMBER. OF THESE STUDIES BOTH FROM MEDIA. AT WE HAD WHEN HERE. IN THE IS A- THE IS. YEAH A REAL. IN IN TO YOU KNOW WHAT IS PER. IN ITS SINCE. AND IT ISN'T ALWAYS OBVIOUS AGAIN WHEN WE CHOSE REFER BACK TO THE TO TEDDY BEARS. YOU'RE OUT WITH YOUR GRANDKIDS AND- YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER ONCE THAT PINK TEDDY BEAR. AND YOU DISCOVER THAT DID PERHAPS EVEN NEXT TO IT IS THE BLUE TEDDY BEAR. AND ITS TWO BUCKS MORE FOR THE PINK WHEN YOU SAY SWEET OR LET LET'S GET THE BLUE ONE. IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE. THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT LANGUAGE THEY'RE GOING TO SIT THERE AND MAKE A STINK RIGHT NOW MIDDLE OF A- OF A DEPARTMENT STORE IN. YOUR EMBARRASSED AND YOU SAY OKAY WILL SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY LET'S GET HERE- THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT. THAT YOU ARE HAVE TO ASK IS A WHY IS SEN HAPPENING. IN IN MAYBE IF I COULD JUST IN THINKING ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I'M GOING BACK IN MY MEMORY OF THE BICYCLE THAT I BOUGHT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER THE PINK ONE THAT I HAD TO GET BECAUSE IT WAS PAYING. FOR HER. AND NOW I'M WONDERING HOW MUCH I PAY MORE FOR THAT PROBABLY ABOUT 13% OF IT FOR ME 13% BUT I GUESS WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS. WORKING THIS IS FOR HILL. TALK ABOUT SEXIST IN THAT COMMENT AIDS. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M WITH MY GRANDDAUGHTERS AND THEY WANT SOMETHING IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT IT IS I'M GOING TO BUY. AND YOU REALLY WANT. ME TO PAY THE ALL THE RIVER. YEAH NO BUT MOST OF US ARE THE SAME WAY IN THE THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES WHY WHY DO THEY WANT PINK AND THEN WHY IS STEPPING MORE EXPENSIVE. THAN THINKING IF IT WERE MY GROUP F. I HAVE GRANDCHILDREN GRANDSONS. I MAY LOOK AT THEM AS A- ALL RIGHT YOU DON'T BEAT. THAT THING YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW I. AB THAT. AND I'M JUST FOR NOT GET THE PINK WOULD KNOW WHAT THE BLACK WHEN AND BLACK ONE TO BE CHEAPER WITH THAT TRUE BUT I'VE IN TERMS OF ME THEM EVERY THAT THEY ME THEY KNOW THAT THE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO DO BUT BUILT FOR THOUGHT IN THAT'S PART OF WHY WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AND I WANNA THANK ALL OF YOU FOR. PARTICIPATING IN THIS- YOU KNOW IT'S IT IS A VERY INTERESTING ONE AGAIN THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ISSUE WE ARE GOING TO DISAGREE WITH THIS AND THIS THE COURTS ARE SET UP SO THAT WE GET THIS KIND OF FRIVOLOUS. TWO VT THIS COULD OF. A TRYING TO BEAR. ON PEOPLE AND EXTORT. THAT THEY GET TAKEN CARE VERY QUICKLY- AND WE'VE HAD. AGAIN THIS BILL IS PART OF THE IN RESERVE RIGHT TO ACT WHICH HAS HAD A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN IT. SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY NINE AND E HAVEN'T SEEN THE WORLD AND- THE COURTS EXPLODE. I'VE HAD A PROBLEM WITH A DA- I DON'T EQUATE THE TWO BUT IF THERE'S SOME WAY WE CAN. SURE EVERYONE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS THIS IS APPLES AND ORANGES A WE'RE NOT. THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING A TAD ALTHOUGH- HOPEFULLY WE'RE SEEING LESS AND LESS ADA VIOLATIONS- OF BECAUSE OF THAT OU KNOW YOU CAN EVEN CALL AT SOME LEVEL OF- INTIMIDATION SO THE PEOPLE ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW. WHAT'S INTERESTING THERE BY THE WAY. IS A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS WELL WHO'S RESPONSIBLE SAID THE LANDLORD WHO RENTS OUT THE UNITS TO PEOPLE THE- THE BUSINESSES THEMSELVES THAT HAVE TO DO THE BUILD OUT- IT IS SIMPLE PROBLEM HERE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PRIVATE PRICING. FRAGILE AND IS THE BILL PROCEEDS HOPEFULLY WE'LL WE'LL HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND TRY TO PINPOINT. IS WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES IN HOW THE HOW WE CAN BEST ADDRESS IT BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL. RECOGNIZE THAT THERE. THERE CLEARLY HAS BEEN A DISCRIMINATION IN PRICING AND WHAT'S PARTICULARLY DISTRESSING IS HOW WE'RE- BASED UPON THIS TESTIMONY REALIZE THAT MOST OF THE PROBLEM IS RELATIVELY NEW. FIND OTHER WAYS YOU KNOW USED TO BE. A HIT VOICE TORIES DEPARTMENT AND THE GIRLS TOYS DEPARTMENT AND THEN THERE WERE LAWSUIT ABOUT THAT THAT THEY COULD NO LONGER DO THAT. SO THAT IN EVERY KIND OF GOT. AGAIN TILL. COMPANY FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT THEY COULD YET AGAINST MORE MONEY OUT OF PRODUCT FOR GIRLS AND- WOMEN. AND HERE WE ARE TRYING TO PUT THE HOPEFULLY PUT THE BRAKES ON THE TO THE MEN OF OUR WOMEN BUSINESS. A COMMUNITY OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE REALLY TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING WILL GET THE CHECK THE. TWENTY CENTER WORKING AT AND- OF THE CERTAINLY. I LOOKED TO THE CAN. THAT A DISK. A AS WE GO FORWARD. WE DO WANT ONE FIGHT. THEY JUST MAKE ONE COMMENT SO SENATOR AND REFUGES INDULGE ME FOR ONE SECOND AND IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT- I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING LIKE PERSONAL CHOICE AND I'VE BEEN AND NOW SINCE THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN WHEN YOU'RE IN A RETAIL LOCATION TO KIND OF DO YOUR OWN ANALYSIS EVEN GOOGLE ON OUR ONLINE RETAILERS AND KIND OF COMPARE PRODUCTS BECAUSE- I THINK THAT IS- A- IN A WAY TO KIND OF INVESTIGATE THIS EVEN FURTHER AND TO FIND CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND LOOK TO SEE WHAT THE PINK ONE IS VERSUS HE OTHER COLORS. TO DO YOUR OWN SELF ANALYSIS OF THIS ISSUES- WHEN YOU'RE STUDYING IT I THINK IT'S HELPFUL I AGREE UNFORTUNATELY THE PROBLEM I'LL GET TO INTEREST IN IS I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE SO MUCH TIME ON THEIR HANDS TO DO THIS I I'VE SEEN SO MANY PEOPLE WITH CHILDREN ZOOMING THROUGH THE GROCERY STORE. GRAB PRADA. THE CARD GETTING THOSE KIDS HOME BECAUSE YOU GOT TO FEED HIM. GOT HOME WORKING GET A BATES YOU'VE GOT A GET TO WORK IT'S ALMOST A LAW. BUT IT IS SOMETHING TO THE TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS THAT TIME TO. TO BE DISCRIMINATING. OR DISCRIMINATING SHOPPERS WHEN IT COMES TO DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE IDEAL. WAS POINDEXTER DO CHOICES AND SO FOR THOSE OF US INTO- MY COLLEAGUE TO. WITH THE CHAMBER JENNIFER I'M SORRY- MOST OF US SOME OF US WOMEN YES WE HAVE THAT OPTION TO BE ABLE TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT WE WANT- BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. A DIFFERENT DEMO. WHO MAY NOT HAVE THAT OPTION WHO MAY NOT HAVE THAT CHOICE. WHO MAY BE FINANCIALLY- RIGHT STRUGGLING YOU KNOW AN EXTRA TWO DOLLARS HERE MAKES A DIFFERENCE SO I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE DON'T NEED MANUFACTURERS ARE RETAILERS TELLING US HOW MUCH WE CAN PAY IT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PAY MORE THAT'S OUR CHOICE BUT DON'T BASE IT BASED ON I'M A ONE MAN AND THIS IS THE PRODUCT I SAT RIGHT HERE IN GOOGLE CAN DAHLE. VERSES A BARBIE DOLL. CAN WAS NINE DOLLARS BARBIE WAS TWELVE DOLLARS. KIDS TO DIE BARBIES A GIRL I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE'RE CLEAR WE NEED TO MAKE THAT. THANK YOU WITH THAT DO WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC TESTIMONY THERE ANY PEOPLE HERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE. IF YOU'D LIKE TO WATER TO COME ON UP HERE SIR AND- YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. IF YOU YOU FOLKS. ARE MORE THAN WELCOME TO STAY OR TO LEAVE A FEW. ARE ARE DONE SIR GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES MY NAME IS SUMIT SHAH AND I'M ACTUALLY HERE'S A PENNY TO MISS META- WHO OF COURSE COMING IN SPEAKING FOR VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT SHE'S BEEN DOING FOR MANY YEARS ACROSS ALL BOTH WITH A WORK AND BOX AND WITHIN CONGRESS- I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO A LOT OF TESTIMONY IT'S VERY POWERFUL INFORMATION AND WAS SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY THAT. MISSOURI HAD MENTIONEDTHE CHAMBER FROM IT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S TAUGHT US SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO MY WORK I'M IN THE VENTURE WILL ENSURE CAPITAL WE BEST A CONSUMER BRANDS SO BRANDS LIKE WILL BE PARKER CUT BY BRANDS LIKE CARRIES AND I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON HARRY'S FOR. EXAMPLE AS A RAZOR START UP WHEN HER STARTED. THE PRODUCT WAS BASED ON THE LEVEL OF KERR. WITH JUST THE RIGHT LEVEL OF CONVENIENCE THE PART THAT IT JUST WORKS. BUT THE BRAND ITSELF WAS MADE WITH THE HIGHEST QUALITY. OF RAZOR FROM A FACTORY IN GERMANY. BUT THE PRICE ITSELF WAS COMPARABLE- BESIDES THE FACT IT WAS SELLING DIRECT TO CONSUMER OR ONLINE- BUT WAS MULTI ALTERNATELY DESIGNED FOR THE LEVEL OF CONVENIENCE TO THE CUSTOMER. THAT RELATES. TO IT. I THINK ABOUT THE GENERAL LEVELS OF THE CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE IT'S DESIGNED TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES TO WORK WITH SMALL BUSINESSES. AND IN ITS ABSOLUTE PURIST FORM. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE DESIGNED WITH THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CUSTOMER. THAT THEY SHOULD PROVIDE. THE BEST LEVEL OF. SERVICE THE BEST REPUTATION. THE BEST LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY AND HELP TO THEIR CUSTOMERS THEMSELVES THAT'S HOW ANY SORT OF CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP YOU CAN DO. WORKS OFFLINE. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS LEVEL OF PRICE DISCRIMINATION THAT. EXISTS FROM HERE IT'S NOT JUST SO MUCH ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE COMPONENTS THEMSELVES. OR SERVICES AND IT'S REALLY LAW LOT DUE TO MARKETING AND I SAY THIS SPECIFICALLY. AS A MEMBER WHO'S PROCEDURES OVER THE PAST ELEVEN YEARS OF MY CAREER- BUT ALSO THAT THE COMPONENTS THEMSELVES ACROSS NO MATTER WHAT GENDER. ARE BASICALLY THE SAME. WE TALK ABOUT COLOGNE SO WE TALK ABOUT- FRAGRANCES THOSE PRODUCTS THEMSELVES THOSE COMPONENTS ARE ACTUALLY THE SAME. AND IT REALLY IS ON A DIFFERENT OKAY OF PACKAGING IT'S A COMMODITIZED WORLD. THE OTHER STORY FOR ANOTHER TIME. BUT I JUST THINK THIS AND CLOSE FROM THIS LEVEL WHERE. RELATIONSHIPS MATTER RIGHT YOU ARE REPRESENTING SMALL BUSINESSES. PRESENTING THESE MODERN POP SHOPS AND SPACES. THAT MORE. THAN NOT DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CA. OF THE PRODUCTS OF THE LOCK MANUFACTURERS. A COMPLIMENT BUT THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS. TO HELP AND HELP HOLD THESE MANUFACTURERS ACCOUNTABLE. AS BOXES BEEN DOING. FOR THE BENEFIT OF CONSUMERS AND FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. THAT'S ALL. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE PAY THIS GUY TAKING. K. OUT OF HIS OWN. REALLY A- AND I THINK IT THIS THAT BE A GOOD CLOSE WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU TO THE SPONSORS THANK YOU TO. THE CHAMBER WILL CONTINUE THE WORK AND THANK YOU FOR THOSE WHO ARE LISTENING TO US. ONWARD AND UPWARD THANK YOU SO MUCH WE ARE ADJOURNED.
