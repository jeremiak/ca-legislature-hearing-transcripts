AN EXAMPLE ABOUT IN MAKING AN

00:54:05.675 --> 00:54:07.110
INVESTMENT IN A BANK BUT IN THIS

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:09.112
CASE IN CALIFORNIA IT WOULD ONLY

00:54:09.179 --> 00:54:12.282
BE -- THE THE STATE AGENCIES

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:14.651
THAT WOULD BE RECEIVING.

00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:16.353
THE FUNDING NOW IF FOR THE STATE

00:54:16.419 --> 00:54:18.254
AGENCY WANTS THAT CASH TO ALSO

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:19.956

INTO ITS ACCOUNT [inaudible]

00:54:24.894 --> 00:54:26.062
THEN.

00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:26.863
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:28.498
WOULD BE NEGOTIATED IN ADVANCE.

00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:30.467
WITH WITH THE COURIER SERVICE

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:34.070
AND WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED -- BUT

00:54:34.137 --> 00:54:35.739
BUT BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE OF

00:54:35.805 --> 00:54:40.110
BANKING -- CHANCE AND THE THE

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:42.712
MOST THE IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT

00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:45.548
I WAS FOCUSED ON THE BILL -- WAS

00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:46.516
TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:54:46.583 --> 00:54:48.785
TRANSPORTATION.

00:54:48.852 --> 00:54:51.254
HAVE HAPPENS IN A SAFE MANNER SO

00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:53.490
THAT THE CASH BEING TRANSPORTED

00:54:53.556 --> 00:54:55.358
FROM THE BUSINESS BECAUSE IN

00:54:55.425 --> 00:54:58.261
CERTAIN CASES -- THE BUSINESS

00:54:58.328 --> 00:55:00.463
MIGHT BE TWO THREE HOURS AWAY

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:01.731
FROM WHERE THE BAD FORM WHERE

00:55:01.798 --> 00:55:04.801
THE STATE AGENCY IS THAT'S

00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:06.369
ACCEPTING THE CASH.

00:55:06.436 --> 00:55:06.970
THAT MAKES OF ALL THAT IS MY

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:08.104
QUESTION THE STATE AGENCY THAT

00:55:08.171 --> 00:55:09.239
WOULD RECEIVE THE CASH WOULD

00:55:09.305 --> 00:55:13.209
JUST BE THE THE TAX BOARD

00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:13.510
[inaudible]

00:55:13.576 --> 00:55:13.910
FRANCHISE BOARD.

00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:16.112
DEPENDS WHO IT'S GOING.

00:55:16.179 --> 00:55:17.380
TO DEPENDS WHO IT'S GOING TO IT

00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:19.115
THERE WAS A I THINK THE BE -- WE

00:55:19.182 --> 00:55:21.484
HAD A SMALL PIECE AT SOME POINT --

00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:23.286
BUT NOW THAT ROLE HAS GONE TO

00:55:23.353 --> 00:55:26.089
SEE THE TFA -- FRANCHISE TAX

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:26.923
BOARD MIGHT HAVE A RULES SO.

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:28.525
DEPENDS ON THE STATE AGENCIES

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:30.160
THAT ARE RECEIVING IT.

00:55:30.226 --> 00:55:31.294
AND THEY WOULD TAKE THE CASH

00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:33.263
DIRECTLY TO THOSE AGENCY YEARS

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:38.535
OR THAT KIND OF THE IN BETWEEN.

00:55:38.601 --> 00:55:39.602
TO EXPAND A LITTLE WELL SO SAID

00:55:39.669 --> 00:55:41.738
THE CAREER IS THE IN BETWEEN.

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:46.109
BECAUSE WILL NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS

00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:48.445
OF OF CANNABIS BUSINESS BUT

00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:49.746
