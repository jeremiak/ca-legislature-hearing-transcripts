I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I THINK THE AUTHOR OF FOR THE BILL- AS I MENTION TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE LITTLE MORE CONVERSATION BEFORE TODAY AND I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION- TODAY AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO GREEN. OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM OUR GOODS MOVEMENT SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK THE GREEN IT IN A VARIETY OF WAYS CERTAINLY AT ELECTRIFICATION MAY BE ONE WAY BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS IN FACT WE ALREADY OF ELLEN G. CNG. IN OUR PORTS WE HAVE SOME ELECTRIC TRUCKS THAT ARE STILL IN THE TESTING STAGE I WOULDN'T PLAYING THEM IS VIABLE TODAY SO I THINK- QUESTION ARISES WHAT ALTERNATELY THIS EQUIPMENT WOULD EVEN LOOK LIKE WHEN THE TRUCKS MAY OR MAY NOT EVEN EXIST YET BUT I MEAN I KNOW THAT YOU YOU RECOGNIZE AS A QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE. THOUGHT THROUGH AND REALLY- YOU WOULDN'T WANT THESE JUST IN THE PORT. YES THESE TRUCKS DRIVE OUT OF THE PORT. THE DRIVE TO YOUR DISTRICT IF YOU HAVE OR YOU HAVE WAREHOUSES IN YOUR DISTRICT YOU HAVE TRUCKS YOU'RE DISTRICTS HAVE. IT'S HARDER WHATEVER MAYBE YOUR DISTRIBUTOR TRUCKS YOU'RE DISTRICTS SO YOU WOULDN'T WANT THEM ONLY IN THE PORT OF JUST KIND OF SOMETIMES A LITTLE. LITTLE SENSE AROUND THE PORTS BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING A LOT. THE PORTS ARE DOING A LOT TO GREEN- THEMSELVES AND THE INDUSTRY AROUND THEM SO I JUST REALLY WANT TO RECOGNIZE ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE. THROUGH A LOT OF CAR MANDATES THROUGH A LOT OF NOT JUST REGULATION IS SIMPLY INNOVATION. THAT'S WHY MY APPROACH IS USUALLY NOT JUST REGULATION INNOVATION. AND I JUST APPRECIATE THAT- THERE'S GONNA BE MORE CONVERSATION AROUND THIS BILL AND THANK YOU AGAIN THE- THANK YOU MISTER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR FROM MISTER GIBSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN OR THINK THE AUTHOR THINK IS OF VERY THOUGHTFUL APPROACH- I WAS EXCITED TO ONE- SO YOU'RE NOT THAT YOU WILL BE WORKING WITH THOSE WHO'VE ALREADY EXPRESSED- THERE- WILLINGNESS TO COLLABORATE WITH YOU- MISTER THE NEW BILL TO MAKE IT BETTER I WAS GLAD THEY WERE POSING OPPOSING THE BILL AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE- AT ME AS COOPER I WOULD REALLY- ENJOYED BEING A CO AUTHOR.

WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE SURE I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR COMMENTS YOU KNOW I DO REPRESENT THE TRI VALLEY THE VERY WHICH GETS A LOT OF THE TRUCK TRAFFIC FROM THE OAKLAND PORT TO THE FIVE AND SO I UNDERSTAND IMPORTANT TO MAKING SURE WE HAVE GREEN TRANSPORTATION MOVING TO AND FROM AIRPORTS BUT IT I AM EXCITED TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU AND WITH THEM. THE FED FORWARD TODAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WORKS FOR THE FUTURE AND WE CAN ACTUALLY REACH OUR GOALS OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BECAUSE THIS HAS TO BE A START PART OF THE PUZZLE. SO I EXPECT LAST YEAR I THOUGHT. THANK YOU SO MEMBER FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PORTS HAVE BEEN AMAZING WHEN THEY LOOK AT MOVING FORWARD AS MEN SO WE RODE ON WAS MENTIONED. WAY BEFORE THE WE MANDATED DUE TO DO SO BEEN A GOOD PARTNER. AND LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT KIND OF. ELEMENTS THAT CAN. HOPE TO GO GREEN IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT I THINK WE NEEDED TO BE MENTIONED HYDROGEN. SO LOOKING FORWARD TO SUPPORTING ALL TECHNOLOGIES MOVE GOING FORWARD IS IMPERATIVE PUT THIS IS A STEP- I'M SUPPORTIVE OF A- TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN PLACE TO REACH UP. I WOULD SAY ALL OF OUR LOFTY GOALS BUT FOR CLEAN VEHICLES BUT I WILL SAY.

IS CALIFORNIA BEGINS TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE THE STATE MUST CONTINUE TO PROMOTE ACTIVITIES REDUCE INDIVIDUAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT INCLUDES THE USE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. WITHOUT OFFENDING OUR BUDGET CHAIR I WILL SAY WE ARE NEVER GOING TO MEET OUR MISSION SCHOOLS THROUGH E. VIS ALONE AND A YOUNG CALIFORNIANS MUST BECOME REGULAR LIFELONG TRANSIT USERS REGARDLESS OF INCOME OR EDUCATION STATUS. AND THIS WILL HELP YOUTH WRITERS PROVIDE TANGIBLE BENEFITS TO USERS AND THEIR FAMILIES INCLUDE. INCLUDING ABILITY COMMUTE TO AND FROM SCHOOL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AFTER A FEW. SUPPORTERS. THANK YOU SOMEONE NUMBER GONZALEZ GOOD AFTERNOON SURE FRAZIER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOE FULL BORE HUH I'D REPRESENTS SACRAMENTO REGIONAL TRANSIT- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE AUTHOR IS DONE IN THIS BILL AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS- TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IS DOWN ALL THROUGHOUT THE NATION BUT WOULD LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY POINT OUT THAT SACRAMENTO REGIONAL TRANSIT HAS BEEN QUOTED BY THE WASHINGTON POST THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW CITIES IN AN AGEOF WRITERS DECLINE AS ACTUALLY STEADILY INCREASING THEIR RIDERSHIP. AS QUOTED- LAST YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN WE ARE DELIGHTED TO PRESENT THIS BILL TODAY- SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF A WRITER T. PROGRAM WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT THE- STRONG INVESTMENT BY THE CITY SACRAMENTO AS WELL AS HER PARTNERS CITIES AS WELL AS THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND WITHOUT FURTHER TO LIKE TO PRESENT COUNCILMEMBER JAYSH NEAR HE IS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER MEMBER AS WELL ASPEN ARE CHEAP BOARD MEMBERS YES MA'AM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL THIS IS WONDERFUL- YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY TIMES WHERE A LOT OF ADULTS GET TOGETHER FROM DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS AND ACTUALLY DO THE RIGHT THING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT THIS IS A PLACE WHERE WE'VE DONE THAT WHERE YOU HAVE THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO REGIONAL TRANSIT A NUMBER OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN A NUMBER OF OUR COMPANY CITIES IN THE COUNTY HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER AND THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE GET WHAT. THEY NEED TO GO. WHEN THEY NEEDED AND. HI COST- YOU DON'T HAVE ANY POLICIES. THIS IS TO GET A ONE FOR TWO FOR A THREE FOR THIS IS ACTUALLY A SX FOR. IF I CAN RUN IT DOWN REALLY QUICKLY FOR YOU ON THE BENEFITS. FOR REGIONAL TRANSIT AS ASSEMBLY WOMAN SAID WE WANT TO CREATE. CHOICE WRITERS WHO ON LIFETIME WRITERS. SO ITS CULTURE AND HAVE IT IF WE CAN START YOUNG PEOPLE EARLY. ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION CHANCES ARE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT. FOR THE SCHOOLS YOU HAVE TWO THINGS GOING ON ONE IS YOU CAN'T TEACH KIDS. IF THEY'RE NOT IN THEIR SEATS. SO THAT'S IMPORTANT- WE KNOW THAT- WHEN WE LOOK A CHRONIC ABSENCE. THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR CHRONIC ABSENCES TRANSPORTATION. ACCORDING TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE SO DOING THIS. GETS KIDS TO SCHOOL WE ALSO KNOW THAT SCHOOLS ARE FUNDED THROUGH EIGHTY EIGHT SO WHEN WE HAVE MORE. YOUNG PEOPLE IN SCHOOL THE SCHOOLS TO BETTER ECONOMICALLY. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WE'RE DOING A LOT OF INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WITHIN SACRAMENTO- WE WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET JOBS GETTING TO AND FROM THOSE JOBS IS IMPORTANT. THIS IS ANOTHER WAY THAT THEY CAN DO IT WITHOUT SPENDING. A GOOD CHUNK OF THE DOLLARS THAT THEY WOULD TURN. ON TRANSPORTATION WE KNOW THAT ENVIRONMENTALLY IT RELIEVES CONGESTION BY GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS IT'S BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. AND JUST AN OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET TO WHERE THEY NEED TO GO WHEN THEY NEED TO GO HAS MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE. WE STARTED THIS PROGRAM OCTOBER FIRST- SINCE THAT PERIOD OF TIME. WE'VE HAD A 422403% INCREASE OVERALL. IN STUDENT WRITER SAID. IN DECEMBER WHERE WE USUALLY DEBT AND LAST YEAR WE DID A TEN DOLLAR. EXPERIMENT THIS DECEMBER WE HAD A 72% INCREASE IN STUDENT RIDERSHIP. SO WE KNOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS ARE GETTING WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. AND AGAIN THIS IS A QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUE WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND THAT AND KEEP IT GOING. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. THE STEP TOWARD. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MICHAEL PIMENTEL HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS BILL- AND AS YOU HEARD FROM SECRETARY WE HAVE SEEN WILK EXPERIENCES THAT SUGGESTS THAT FREE OR DISCOUNTED TRANSIT PASSES- DO INCREASE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP ONE SUPPORTER MEMBERS IN DOING THAT. WE DO HAVE SOME GENERAL QUESTIONS PERHAPS SOME CONCERNS AROUND OF THE FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL IMPACTS OF THE BILL ON A TRANSIT AGENCY MEMBERS WE REALLY DO HOPE TO HAVE A CONSTRUCTIVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. AROUND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT TECH OF SEEING A TRANS OPERATIONS ARE FINANCIAL BUDGETS IN OTHER SENSES. THANK YOU.

MR GIPSON. I JUST HAVE A GOOD ACTUALLY- COMMONER TO WHAT I BELIEVE THIS IS INNOVATIVE THIS IS OUT OF THE BOX THINKING I THINK THAT- IT CERTAINLY CREATES THAT A GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WILL LOOK AT- ONE. OUR CURRENT CLIMATE WORRYING AND USE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION- THAT IS ACCESSIBLE- USABLE FRIENDLY- AND I THINK THAT THIS IS CERTAIN THE WAY WE SHOULD BE GOING IN TERMS OF HIS OWN COMMAND THE AUTHOR. OF THE COUNCIL FOR COMING AND GIVING YOUR INPUT BECAUSE I THINK IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND I THINK IT GETS US TO WHERE WE WANT TO GO AND ALSO I APPRECIATE THE MESSES IS SENDING TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. THAT WE HAVE THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THEM AND PUTTING THEM IN THE FOREFRONT SOME DECISIONS SO I THINK IT SENDS MULTIPLE POSITIVE MESSAGES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OFFICE FOR THIS BILL TODAY. MR USER. THANK YOU MIGHT MISTER CHAIR- MISSED BECAUSE ALMOST EIGHTY FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I'D LOVE TO JOIN YOU AS A CO AUTHOR AS WELL- I THINK IF. IF THE TRANSPORTATION ISSUE WAS ADDRESSED IN THE WAY THAT YOUR GOING ABOUT ADDRESSING IT. WE MAY HAVE- BEEN ABLE TO- NOT SEE THE CRISIS LEVEL OF- HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING. RELATED ISSUES THAT WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY ARE INTRICATELY. INTERTWINED WITH ONE ANOTHER ONE TWO I THINK- MR CHU IS ALSO BEING INSPIRED TO INTRODUCE SOME OTHER LEGISLATION THAT ONE THIS THAT I'M PROBABLY GONNA BE JOINING HIM. AS CO AUTHORS SWELLED SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS ROAD. YES SIR THANK YOU FOR THE BILL SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD CONCEPT IS A HELP KIDS GET TO SCHOOL MANY KIDS ALREADY TAKE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS THEIR MONEY IN THIS BILL OR IS THIS JUST GONNA BE A MANDATE AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO. HOW DOES IT WAS THE COST I HAPPEN TO BE MARRIED TO SOMEBODY WHO IS THE HEAD OF OUR- MTS IN SAN DIEGO WHICH IS THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM SO I HEAR ABOUT THIS EVERY DAY WE I KNOW WE NEED A FUNDING SOURCE- WE LOOK I REALLY WOULD LIKE US TO START HAVING I THINK THAT PASSED CONVERSATIONS ABOUT YOUTH. TRANSIT PASSES HAVE BEEN AROUND NEED- FINANCIAL NEED WHICH IS NO IT'S GREAT- BUT THAT DOESN'T GET US TO GETTING TRANSIT REGULAR NORMALIZE BASICALLY IN USE BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS EIGHT WAY TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS SOME OF THE DOLLARS THAT WE TALK ABOUT CABBAGE IN THAT TO ACTUALLY READ THAT WILL ACTUALLY SEE TO REDUCE EMISSIONS- ALONG WITH WORKING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS TECHNICALLY WE HAVE A APPROACH AND WE'RE WORKING ON NOW BECAUSE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD TO CUT BACK THE- WALKING THREE AND A HALF. MILES TO SCHOOL BUS RIGHT BUT OUT. ARE THE FACT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE I'LL SEE YOU. ON FROM MY LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL MY SCHOOL TEACHER. THE C. BUSLOADS OF KIDS COME OFF THAT BUS INTO GOOD THING. YOU KNOW THEY'RE GETTING TO SCHOOL AND WE'RE HELPING HELPING THEM GET THE SCHOOL BECAUSE- NOT ALWAYS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS PROVIDE THAT THAT TRANSPORTATION SO AGAIN THAT'S A GOOD THING. THE QUESTIONS HOUSE I PAY FOR THAT WE AT LEAST A LOOK AT SOME SOME POTS OF MONEY AROUND THE STATE. AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT ABOUT CAPITA RATE ACTUALLY USING IT. TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES. NOT JUST WATER HAD SHOT ACTUALLY USING IT. TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO I HOPE YOU HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. POINT FOUR BUT I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER REGULAR CURRY. I THANK YOU SOME REMEMBER BRING THIS FORWARD AND I DID WALK THREE AND A HALF MILES AND SNOW SO YOU KNOW JUST LET ME KNOW- SO I'M TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I AGREE THAT WE HAVE TO ENCOURAGE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP WITH OUR YOUTH AND TO PROMOTE LIFELONG TRANSIT USERS HOWEVER I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL ON SMALLER TRANSIT AGENCIES LIKE THOSE IN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FOR I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL COMES UP WHEN IT COMES TO FOR THE MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T LEAVE SOME PEOPLE UP- AND I'M YOU KNOW I WILL FIGHT FOR MY RURAL COMMUNITIES AND MY SMALLER AGENCIES. I LOVE THE GOAL OF THIS BILL I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT BUT- I REALLY WANT THEM YOU TO CONSIDER THAT AS YOU MOVE THE BILL FOR IT. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KANSEN CHU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A KEEP MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD I AM I WOULD BE DEFINITELY BE HAPPY TO ADD THAT AS A CO AUTHOR YEAH I DON'T BELIEVE THE COST IS A BIG FACTORAT LEAST FROM WHAT I OF A REPRESENT THE SENATE SANTA CLARA COUNTY- REVENUE LIKE IS ONLY LIKE NINE PERCENT. OF THE REVENUE IS FROM THE FARE BOX SO ADDING MORE STUDENT TO THE EMPTY BOX THE BUSES I DON'T SEE WILL CREATE ANY OF FINANCIAL HARDSHIP TO OUR TRANSIT OPERATORS AND BUT IT WOULD DEFINITELY BENEFIT OUR OUR STUDENTS AND HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW LIKE THAT BEING SAID OF MANY TOP YOU WERE. THE ENCOURAGED A CULTURE OF USING. THE PUBLIC TRANSIT SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR FROM THE COMMITTEE. SUMMARY ARE YOU WILLING TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. I GUESS. ALRIGHT I'M SORRY I IT SOMEHOW MISS THAT SO YES ABSOLUTELY I. ONE RIGHT UP FRONT. ALREADY VOTE WAS. THANK YOU THANK YOU- WAS LIKE BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO SAY I HEAR YOU ON CALL AND THE COST IS SOMETHING I LITERALLY HERE ABOUT EVERY SINGLE DAY IN MY HOUSEHOLD- SO I UNDERSTAND WE'VE GOT TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT WORKS FOR A BIG TRANSIT AGENCIES AND SMALL ONES AND ONE RELY HEAVILY ON THE FAREBOX RECOVERY IN THOSE WHO DON'T- I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION THOUGH AND WHAT IT'S NOT IT IN FOR YEARS I'VE- BEEN PUSHING THIS LOCALLY- FOR MY COMMUNITY WHERE KIDS DON'T HAVE ACCESS FOR EXAMPLE ON TWELVE MILES THE BEACH BY. BEACH BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET THERE RIGHT TALKING TO A WHILE BUT IT WAS REALLY- WATCHING MY DAUGHTER'S EXPERIENCE THAT GOT ME TO THINK ABOUT THIS IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND THAT WE CAN'T THINK OF PUBLIC TRANSIT IT'S ONLY THOSE WHO ARE POOR- I HAD ADOPTED WHICH TO YORK. RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND LEARN TO USE PUBLIC TRANSIT AS A NORMAL SHE NOW LIVES IN LA AND DOES NOT A CAR SHE CAN ACTUALLY EVERY SHE NEEDS TO GO BY PUBLIC. SAID I DON'T THINK. WE HAVE HAD. CONSTANTLY LINE ON PUBLIC TRANSIT THAT WE WOULD HAVE SOMEBODY WILLING TO GIVE UP AT TWENTY THREE A CAR- BECAUSE LIKE WHY DO YOU WANT TO SEND TRAFFIC I MEAN TO HER IT'S SO OBVIOUS- WE HAVE TO GET PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR AND FOR EVER GOING TO MEET OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS EVER WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO YOU KNOW DRASTICALLY REDUCE EMISSIONS COMING FROM CARS AND IT'S A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION TO HAVE AND NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT EXCEPT YOU KNOW- IN TERMS OF LEVI'S OR KIND OF AROUND THE EDGES BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO GET PEOPLE TO WRITE RELY MORE HEAVILY ON PUBLIC TRANSIT FOR THAT TO WORK WE HAVE TO GET MORE PEOPLE INTO- PUBLIC TRANSIT WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG SAID THEY'LL PAY FOR IT WHEN THEY GET OLDER. AND I THINK THIS IS A AN APPROACH THAT WILL WILL HELP US DO THAT SO I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH LARGE AND SMALL DISEASE FIGURE OUT HOW WE PAY FOR IT. BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY HOPE TO MOVE THIS. SO THANK YOU FOR USE FOR TO US TODAY. HI TO BELIEVE THE PEOPLE RIGHT TRANSIT AT A YOUNG AGE WILL GROW INTO LIFELONG WRITERS. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. WELL I THINK YOUR BILL IS A GOOD START TOWARDS THIS GOAL I KNOW THERE WILL BE CHALLENGES FOR SOME TRANSIT ABLE TO FIND SOLUTIONS FOR THEM. I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY- BUT EXPECT THAT YOU'LL. HOPEFULLY PEOPLE ARE COMMITTEE- INFORMED AND ON AS IT PROGRESSES MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL.
