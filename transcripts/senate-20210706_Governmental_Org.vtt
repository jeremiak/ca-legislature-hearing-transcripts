00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:52.851
IS A POSITION- BOARD DECIDES.

00:25:52.918 --> 00:25:54.819
OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER

00:25:54.886 --> 00:25:57.055
CHAIR- ASSEMBLYMAN COOPER NICE

TO SEE YOU AND THANK YOU FOR

00:25:58.723 --> 00:26:00.425
BRINGING YOUR BILL FORWARD BUT

00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:03.728
I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT IT.

00:26:03.795 --> 00:26:04.729
YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:06.932
A SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE

00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:08.166
PROFESSIONALS IN CALIFORNIA

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:10.135
WHICH IS WHY WE OFTEN TIMES TRY

00:26:10.201 --> 00:26:11.870
TO PASS BILLS THAT- YOU KNOW

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:13.471
WE'LL HAVE NEW NEW MEDICAL

00:26:13.538 --> 00:26:15.974
SCHOOLS AND OTHER. WAYS TO

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:18.143
EXPAND. THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES

00:26:18.209 --> 00:26:19.210
THAT WE HAVE IN THE MEDICAL

00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:22.347
FIELD SO THIS SEEMS TO LIMIT

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:26.952
THAT AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO-

00:26:27.018 --> 00:26:28.386
WHAT'S YOUR REASONING IS BEHIND

00:26:28.453 --> 00:26:30.655
THAT IS THERE SOME. GENESIS TO

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:31.957
THIS BILL THAT YOU DIDN'T

00:26:32.023 --> 00:26:32.457
OUTLINE IN YOUR OPENING

00:26:32.524 --> 00:26:34.292
STATEMENT FURNITURE CONCERNS

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:35.660
WHAT IS YOUR TEMPORARY

00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:37.495
CONTRACTS AND USING SOME FOLKS

00:26:37.562 --> 00:26:39.431
GO OVER A YEAR. SO OTHERS OF

00:26:39.497 --> 00:26:41.800
SHORTAGE- IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:42.934
QUITE TAKE A YEAR TO GET

00:26:43.001 --> 00:26:43.969
SOMEBODY ON BOARD WITH THAT

00:26:44.035 --> 00:26:46.004
SOURCING IT USED TO BYPASS. THE

00:26:46.071 --> 00:26:47.238
OF TWO POSITIONS ARE DENNIS

00:26:47.305 --> 00:26:49.107
WORKING SIDE BY SIDE. IT IS

00:26:49.174 --> 00:26:50.442
PERSONAL THE TEMPORARIES

00:26:50.508 --> 00:26:52.677
PROFESSIONAL CONTRACT IS MAKING

00:26:52.744 --> 00:26:53.411
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN THE

00:26:53.478 --> 00:26:55.480
STATE EMPLOYEES. THAT'S THAT'S

00:26:55.547 --> 00:26:56.181
BEEN A BIG ISSUE SO THERE'S

00:26:56.247 --> 00:26:58.049
BEEN SOME ABUSE THERE WITH THAT

00:26:58.116 --> 00:26:59.417
SAID ARE YOU SAYING THAT WE ARE

00:26:59.484 --> 00:27:01.853
PAYING THEM THESE- OTHER FOLKS

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.824
MORE. THAN WE'RE PAYING THE

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:09.995
STATE WORKERS CORRECT- THAT

00:27:10.061 --> 00:27:11.896
SEEMS ODD THAT THE STATE WOULD

00:27:11.963 --> 00:27:14.799
PAY MORE FOR PRIVATE.

00:27:14.866 --> 00:27:16.468
CONTRACTORS THAN IT WOULD FOR

00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:20.772
STATE EMPLOYEES A- YOU'RE SURE

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:23.808
DOES LOVE THING SOMETIMES YES.

00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:25.744
OKAY AND I WISH MY- WITNESSES

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.746
WERE HERE BECAUSE THEY CAN GO

00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:28.380
INTO MUCH MORE DEPTH THAN I CAN

00:27:28.446 --> 00:27:30.148
ON THE ISSUE MODERATOR LET'S

00:27:30.215 --> 00:27:31.149
CHECK AND SEE IF THOSE

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:32.350
WITNESSES ARE ON THE LINE IS

00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:34.019
THERE ANYWAY THIS IS- THAT ARE

00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:36.087
ON THE LINE. WE DIDN'T BEAT

00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:38.890
WERE ABLE TO GET BEFORE THE

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:41.593
COLLAPSE OF THE QUESTION. ONE

00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:50.368
MOMENT PLEASE. ELIZABETH YOUR

00:27:50.435 --> 00:27:50.935
WITNESS YOUR LINE IS OPEN AT

00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:59.344
THIS TIME. AND I DO NOT SEE ANY

00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:02.514
OKAY SO I JUST WANNA DO THERE'S

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.081
GOING TO BE THE LAST WORD I

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:05.083
GUESS. OKAY WELL I DO AND

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:06.584
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT YOUR

00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:07.452
WITNESSES WERE ABLE TOBE ON

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:09.254
MAYBE THEY'LL POP ON HERE

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.523
SHORTLY BECAUSE I HEARD YOU

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:13.425
TALK ABOUT FIDUCIARY CONCERNS

00:28:13.491 --> 00:28:15.226
IN AN OFTEN TIMES IT HAPPENS

00:28:15.293 --> 00:28:17.128
IT'S MORE COST EFFECTIVE. FOR

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:18.530
THE STATE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:20.665
THIS IN ADDITION TO IT JUST

00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:22.067
BEING MORE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE OF

00:28:22.133 --> 00:28:24.002
THE LACK OF PERSONNEL. BUT I

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:25.370
HEARD TWO THINGS ONE IT WAS A

00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:28.173
FIDUCIARY REASON AND THEN I

00:28:28.239 --> 00:28:30.108
HEARD. THAT THE STATUS. PAYING

00:28:30.175 --> 00:28:32.310
MORE THAN WE NEED TO SELL WHICH

00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:34.312
IS IT. WHAT WHAT WHAT IS IT IN

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:36.581
A GOOD SHIFT CONTRACTS ARE NOT

00:28:36.648 --> 00:28:38.183
SUBJECT TO CIVIL SERVICE RULES.

00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:40.285
WE GO OUTSIDE. I'M SORRY SAY

00:28:40.351 --> 00:28:42.320
AGAIN I HEAR THE FIRST PART. OF

00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:43.555
THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATED

00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:45.290
CONTRACTS AND THEY'RE NOT

00:28:45.356 --> 00:28:47.058
SUBJECT TO CIVIL SERVICE RULES.

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:48.693
BUT THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.694
STILL HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:50.862
THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE RULES

00:28:50.929 --> 00:28:52.497
AND THE UNIONS CAN STILL

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.566
CONTEST THOSE THOSE CONTRACTS

00:28:54.632 --> 00:28:57.368
RIGHT. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW

00:28:57.435 --> 00:28:58.369
THEY CAN BUT WITH THESE

00:28:58.436 --> 00:29:00.805
CONTRACTS- OBVIOUSLY THEIR PAY

00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:01.339
MORE SO THAT THAT THAT IS

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:04.042
FACTUAL. OKAY THANK YOU THANK

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:05.977
YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU

00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:08.680
CENTER BORDERS. I THINK MY

00:29:08.746 --> 00:29:10.815
COLLEAGUE- POSE QUESTION THAT I

00:29:10.882 --> 00:29:12.283
WAS GOING TO POSE IT'S GOOD TO

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.487
SEE YOU AS A MEMBER- I KNOW

00:29:15.553 --> 00:29:17.122
HE'S A VERY THOUGHTFUL

00:29:17.188 --> 00:29:20.091
LEGISLATOR- AS I MENTIONED- MY

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:21.326
COLLEAGUE POSE THE QUESTIONS

00:29:21.392 --> 00:29:23.261
THAT I WANTED TO POSE BUT-

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:24.596
MAYBE I'LL JUST FOLLOW THIS

00:29:24.662 --> 00:29:28.399
LAST RABBIT DOWN THE HOLE. THE

00:29:28.466 --> 00:29:29.300
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE

00:29:29.367 --> 00:29:30.869
INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH THE

00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:32.871
UNIONS THAT REPRESENT THE

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:35.573
EMPLOYEE BLOCKS- CAN YOU

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.976
EXPLAIN. WHY THAT IS ESSENTIAL

00:29:38.042 --> 00:29:39.844
IF WE'RE LOOKING AT SHORT TERM.

00:29:39.911 --> 00:29:43.848
CONTRACTS. WHY WOULD IT BE

00:29:43.915 --> 00:29:46.084
ESSENTIAL THAT THAT INFORMATION

00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:48.319
BE CONVEYED TO THE UNION. THAT

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:50.188
REPRESENTS THAT EMPLOYEE WALK

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:51.422
BECAUSE ONE OF THESE FOLKS ARE

00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:51.956
BEING PAID THAT'S A GREAT

00:29:52.023 --> 00:29:53.124
QUESTION BECAUSE THEY'VE

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:54.859
THEY'VE CIRCUMVENTED. THE

00:29:54.926 --> 00:29:56.561
SYSTEM AND THAT'S REASONABLE TO

00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:59.097
BEING PAID HIGHER BECAUSE- WITH

00:29:59.164 --> 00:30:00.231
THE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM THERE

00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:02.066
IS NEGOTIATED BUT IT'S OPENS

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:03.902
THEY'RE PAYING MORE I REALIZE A

00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:05.837
SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS BUT- TO DO

00:30:05.904 --> 00:30:06.871
THE SAME JOB AND GET PAID

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:09.741
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE- IT DOESN'T.

00:30:09.807 --> 00:30:10.808
FIT WELL TO OUR DOCKS IN OUR

00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:15.813
POSITIONS THAT- DO IT FROM. SAY

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.447
RIGHT NOW THAT'S REALLY THE BIG

00:30:16.514 --> 00:30:17.048
ISSUE. WHAT AND I WOULDN'T BE

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:17.882
SURPRISED IF SHORT TERM

00:30:17.949 --> 00:30:19.684
EMPLOYEES ARE PAID MORE THAN

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:21.786
STATE EMPLOYEES. BY THE VERY

00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:23.388
NATURE OF A SHORT TERM CONTRACT

00:30:23.454 --> 00:30:25.356
YOU'RE SATISFYING IN. AN

00:30:25.423 --> 00:30:27.559
IMMEDIATE NEED. HI OF COURSE

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:28.526
THE PREMIUMS GO UP WITH

00:30:28.593 --> 00:30:30.728
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I GUESS MY

00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:32.297
CONCERN AND I KNOW YOU DO YOUR

00:30:32.363 --> 00:30:34.666
HOMEWORK- WHAT WE LEARNED FROM

00:30:34.732 --> 00:30:36.668
THE PANDEMIC. IS THAT WE NEED

00:30:36.734 --> 00:30:39.070
TO HAVE A MORE NIMBLE HEALTH

00:30:39.137 --> 00:30:42.106
SYSTEM. FIVE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW.

00:30:42.173 --> 00:30:43.741
EXTERNALITIES IN THINGS THAT

00:30:43.808 --> 00:30:47.111
CANNOT BE FORESEEN- COME ABOUT

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:48.146
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:49.881
PANDEMIC IS GOING TO GO NEXT.

00:30:49.948 --> 00:30:52.050
BUT IF WE CURTAIL. THE ABILITY

00:30:52.116 --> 00:30:53.384
OF THE STATE TO CONTRACT OUT

00:30:53.451 --> 00:30:55.887
FOR THESE SERVICES. I'M AFRAID

00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:56.521
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE CUTTING OUR

00:30:56.588 --> 00:30:58.156
NOSE TO SPITE OUR FACE IN NOT

00:30:58.223 --> 00:31:00.291
LEARNING LESSONS. SHOULD BE

00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:01.893
LEARNED FROM OVER THE LAST YEAR

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.029
AND A HALF SO- I APPRECIATE THE

00:31:05.096 --> 00:31:06.831
WORK YOU DO- THERE MIGHT JUST.

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:09.267
BE A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:10.435
ON THIS ONE MY FRIENDS. SURE IT

00:31:10.501 --> 00:31:11.869
WOULD BE FILLED WITH C. C. R.

00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:13.371
THAT HAVE BEEN PSYCHIATRIST

00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:16.274
THAT MADE- THREE OR FOUR

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:18.843
THOUSAND DOLLARS. ON A CONTRACT

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.779
SERVICE LIKE THIS. IS A- FULL

00:31:21.846 --> 00:31:24.515
TIME- SEE IF YOUR EMPLOYEES

00:31:24.582 --> 00:31:26.050
THAT MAKES IT'S ACTUALLY LESS.

00:31:26.117 --> 00:31:28.086
SO THIS THIS IS UNFAIR VIEWS

00:31:28.152 --> 00:31:32.790
BUT IT'S WIDESPREAD. THIS IS

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:34.826
THANK YOU THANK YOU I THINK

00:31:34.892 --> 00:31:35.827
WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO CONTRACT

00:31:35.893 --> 00:31:38.029
OUT. FOR SHORT TERM NOT LONG

00:31:38.096 --> 00:31:39.230
TERM BUT FOR SHORT TERM

00:31:39.297 --> 00:31:40.765
CONTRACTS YOU WERE FILLING

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:43.701
SPECIFIC GAPS. IN THAT NATION

00:31:43.768 --> 00:31:46.104
QUALIFICATION. NATURALLY WAS

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.338
PROBABLY GOING TO DEMAND A

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:50.041
HIGHER PAY THAN A FULL TIME

00:31:50.108 --> 00:31:51.843
LONG TERM CONTRACT FROM AN

00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:53.978
EMPLOYEE BLOCK. INTERNATIONALLY

00:31:54.045 --> 00:31:54.479
RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY WE

00:31:54.545 --> 00:31:56.347
SPECIFIED HERE. THEY CAN'T

00:31:56.414 --> 00:31:58.316
CONTRACT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR

00:31:58.383 --> 00:31:59.017
SO I THINK A YEAR IS

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:01.319
SUBSTANTIAL TIME TO TRY TO FIND

00:32:01.386 --> 00:32:03.955
SOMEONE FOR A YEAR OR THIRTY

00:32:04.022 --> 00:32:05.556
FIVE DAYS IN A IN A TWO MONTH

00:32:05.623 --> 00:32:08.926
TWENTY FOUR MONTH PERIOD. WE'RE

00:32:08.993 --> 00:32:09.527
TRYING TO NEARLY DIVINE THAT.

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:11.529
IT ALSO SHOULD BE POINTED OUT-

00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:13.031
DENTURES THAT CENTER MELINDA'S

00:32:13.097 --> 00:32:15.133
WILL PROCEED THIS IS A- GIVEN

THE BILL BECAUSE FOR A NUMBER

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:48.633
OF REASONS BUT- HOPING THAT YOU

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.568
COULD- BE CLEARER ABOUT THE

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:52.403

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:00.845
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE-

00:33:00.912 --> 00:33:02.280

THAT WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING THE

00:33:08.953 --> 00:33:09.454
RULES BECAUSE THE RULES ARE

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.189
CLEAR HERE. THAT A PROPOSED

00:33:11.255 --> 00:33:12.990
CONTRACT SHOULD RESULT IN AN

00:33:13.057 --> 00:33:14.158
OVERALL COST SAVINGS TO THE

00:33:14.225 --> 00:33:15.593
STATE WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING IS

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.761
THE SHORT TERM CONTRACTS

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:17.862

EXACERBATED BY THE SWORD OF

00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:32.610
QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS BUT

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:34.512
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE- IN THE

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:36.080
ANALYSIS THAT PROVIDES ANY

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:38.416
SPECIFIC DATA- I COULD GO TO

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:39.917
THAT COMMITTEE CANCELED AND ASK

00:33:39.984 --> 00:33:41.753
IF HE IS AWARE OF ANY DATA.

00:33:41.819 --> 00:33:45.857
PROVIDED TO HIM. IT SHOWS THE

00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:46.457
EXTENT OF THIS PROBLEM. CAN I

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:47.492
ASK MISTER CHAIRMAN CAN I ASK

00:33:47.558 --> 00:33:48.826
THEIR CONSOLE THERE'S BEEN ANY

00:33:48.893 --> 00:33:50.828
DATA HE'S AWARE OF. THAT SHOWS

00:33:50.895 --> 00:33:52.563
THE EXTENT OF THIS PROBLEM. YES

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:53.998
AS AS A WE ASKED A DISEASE

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:55.700
RATHER INFORMATION. CENTER

00:33:55.767 --> 00:33:57.769
UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME WE

00:33:57.835 --> 00:33:58.369
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT

00:33:58.436 --> 00:34:00.271
INFORMATION FROM THEM- AND THAT

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:01.639
THAT THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:02.707
STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:04.375
I APPRECIATE THE GOOD

00:34:04.442 --> 00:34:06.177
INTENTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. BUT

00:34:06.244 --> 00:34:07.111
YOU KNOW WE GET HIT ALL THE

00:34:07.178 --> 00:34:09.080
TIME ABOUT A LACK OF EFFICIENCY

00:34:09.147 --> 00:34:10.415
IN STATE GOVERNMENT. SO WE SET

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:12.049
RULES THAT SAY CONTRACTING OUT

00:34:12.116 --> 00:34:14.152
GONNA HAPPEN IN LIMITED WAYS.

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:17.221
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT IT'S

00:34:17.288 --> 00:34:17.789
GOING TO PROVIDE AN OVERALL

00:34:17.855 --> 00:34:18.990
COST SAVINGS. I MEAN THAT'S

00:34:19.056 --> 00:34:20.458
WHAT THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS HERE

00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:23.861
ON IN THE ANALYSIS- AND LISTEN

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:25.830
I HEAR THAT I HEAR THE APPEAL

00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:27.865
ABOUT A YEAR BUT NOW WE CAN'T

00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:28.466
EVEN GET A REGULATION OF THE

00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:31.602
STATED A YEAR. ON LABOR

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:33.538
VIOLATIONS- DURING A PANDEMIC.

00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:34.906
SO WE HAVE STRUGGLE AT ALL

00:34:34.972 --> 00:34:36.007
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO

00:34:36.073 --> 00:34:38.075
MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT. AND SO

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:39.310
I'M WONDERING IF WE'LL BUY YOU

00:34:39.377 --> 00:34:40.812
KNOW THAT THIS BILL IS SO IS SO

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:42.380
BROAD BASED IN ITS APPLICATION

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:43.214
THAT I CAN HAVE A LOT OF

00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:44.482
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHICH

00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:47.151
IS WHY I GO BACK TO. TRYING TO

00:34:47.218 --> 00:34:47.885
UNDERSTAND WHERE IS THE ABUSE

00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:50.755
HAPPENING- AND IT DOES SEEM TO

00:34:50.822 --> 00:34:51.756
ME THAT THAT THAT MAY BE THE

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:53.858
RIGHT. IN A TWO STEP THE FIRST

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:55.293
STEP IS REALLY TO FIND OUT THE

00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:56.260
EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM AND A

00:34:56.327 --> 00:34:58.062
BILL THAT. SAYS THAT WE NEED

00:34:58.129 --> 00:34:59.497
THE STATE TO REPORT IN ON ALL

00:34:59.564 --> 00:35:01.032
THE EXAMPLES OF CONTRACTING OUT

00:35:01.098 --> 00:35:03.034
BEYOND THE YEAR. SO WE COULD

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:03.901
SEE THAT DATA AND THAT ABUSE

00:35:03.968 --> 00:35:05.770
MIGHT BE THE- THE FIRST STEP OF

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:07.738
A TWO STEP HERE. TO ADVANCE THE

00:35:07.805 --> 00:35:08.539
BILL THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT

00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:09.941
FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS

00:35:10.007 --> 00:35:11.876
THE BEST OF INTENTIONS- BUT IT

00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:13.411
SEEMS THAT IT'S ON A FOUNDATION

00:35:13.478 --> 00:35:14.779
THAT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE.

00:35:14.846 --> 00:35:18.583

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:51.473
MOTION BY SENATOR ARCHULETA THE

01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:53.575

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:03.451
NORMALLY I THINK I'D BE A

01:22:03.518 --> 01:22:06.388
LITTLE RESERVED ON. A STATE

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:09.491

01:22:13.194 --> 01:22:15.964
FILLERS AND- IN OTHER

01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:18.300
COMPONENTS OF THE PACKAGE BUT I

01:22:18.366 --> 01:22:20.435
THINK WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT

01:22:20.502 --> 01:22:23.004
IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE EXPECTING

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:24.906

CONVERGE AND TRANSFORM THEIR

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:31.980
FLEET THEN THE STATE NEEDS TO

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:33.915
PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE AND I THINK

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:35.216
THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:37.619
MAKES THIS A BILL THAT IS WORTH

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:40.322
MOVING IS BECAUSE NOT ALWAYS

01:22:40.388 --> 01:22:42.557

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:43.692
ITS MANDATES AND IN THIS

01:22:43.758 --> 01:22:46.127

SEVENTY ONE OF SEVERAL

01:52:16.062 --> 01:52:17.831
COUNTRIES AT THAT TIME TROPICAL

01:52:17.897 --> 01:52:20.667
FORESTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY-

01:52:20.733 --> 01:52:23.036
HAVING SOME LARGE AMOUNTS OF

01:52:23.103 --> 01:52:24.704
ISSUES REGARDING SUSTAINABILITY

01:52:24.771 --> 01:52:26.773
AND DEFORESTATION NOT JUST

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:29.776
BECAUSE OF THE- THERE A QUITE A

01:52:29.843 --> 01:52:30.376
FEW OTHER COUNTRIES ALONG THE

01:52:35.748 --> 01:52:37.784
DELVING INTO INTERNATIONAL

01:52:37.851 --> 01:52:42.055

01:52:42.122 --> 01:52:42.655

01:52:42.722 --> 01:52:44.657
STANDARDS. ONE OF THE CONCERNS

01:52:44.724 --> 01:52:46.459
THAT I WOULD HAVE AND MAYBE YOU

01:52:46.526 --> 01:52:47.861
CAN ANSWER IF IT'S BEEN

01:52:47.927 --> 01:52:49.662
DEVELOPED AT ALL OR MAYBE IT'S

01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:52.832
NOT AN ISSUE. ALTOGETHER IS

01:52:52.899 --> 01:52:53.333
WHETHER OR NOT ANY TRADE

01:52:53.399 --> 01:52:55.802
AGREEMENT. THAT MIGHT EXIST

01:52:55.869 --> 01:52:58.004
BETWEEN THE US AND BRAZIL.

01:52:58.071 --> 01:53:01.841
WOULD BE IN CONFLICT WITH.

01:53:01.908 --> 01:53:03.409
PIECE OF DOMESTIC LEGISLATION

01:53:03.476 --> 01:53:06.880
LIKE THIS THIS HERBAL BUSINESS

01:53:06.946 --> 01:53:08.815
LEGISLATION IS NOT TARGET ANY

01:53:08.882 --> 01:53:10.416
INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY WHAT IT DOES

01:53:10.483 --> 01:53:12.819
IS SETS VALUES FOR US AS A

01:53:12.886 --> 01:53:14.487
STATE AS TO WHETHER WE'RE GOING

01:53:14.554 --> 01:53:16.556
TO CONTRIBUTE TO DEFORESTATION

01:53:16.623 --> 01:53:18.491
FOR PROCUREMENT POLICIES IT'S

01:53:18.558 --> 01:53:20.493
ONLY REGARDING STATE PURCHASING

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:22.695
INSIDE TELLING PRIVATE SECTOR

01:53:22.762 --> 01:53:24.297
WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO.

01:53:24.364 --> 01:53:27.333
AND WE HAVE PLENTY OF PRECEDENT

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:28.067
FOR INCLUDING LAST COUPLE

01:53:28.134 --> 01:53:31.237
YEARS- BANNING COSMETICS THAT-

01:53:31.304 --> 01:53:34.007
INVOLVE ANIMAL TESTING- THERE

01:53:34.073 --> 01:53:36.309
WAS AT THE IME- THERE IS SOME

01:53:36.376 --> 01:53:38.378
CONCERN FROM CHINA AT THE TIME

01:53:38.444 --> 01:53:39.612
OF THE CONSOLE OTHER COUNTRIES

01:53:39.679 --> 01:53:41.181
BUT NOT ONLY WAS IT A DOCTOR

01:53:41.247 --> 01:53:42.649
BUT WE SEE THE INDUSTRY MOVE IN

01:53:42.715 --> 01:53:44.350
A MUCH MORE POSITIVE DIRECTION

01:53:44.417 --> 01:53:46.786
AGAIN IT'S NOT IT'S USING OUR

01:53:46.853 --> 01:53:48.421
PURCHASING POWER TO REPRESENT

01:53:48.488 --> 01:53:49.923
OUR VALUES AND IN NO WAY.

01:53:49.989 --> 01:53:51.991
PROHIBITS ANY INTERACTION OR

01:53:52.058 --> 01:53:53.426
TRADE WITH ANY NATION AS LONG

01:53:53.493 --> 01:53:54.928
AS THEY'RE OPERATING IN A

01:53:54.994 --> 01:54:00.166
SUSTAINABLE. MANNER AND THERE

01:54:00.233 --> 01:54:00.800
ARE METRICS WITHOUT. ALL RIGHT

01:54:00.867 --> 01:54:01.935
SIR THEY'RE IN A YOUR

01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:02.902
ESTIMATION THERE NO CALL. WITH

01:54:02.969 --> 01:54:05.638
THIS. PROCUREMENT POLICY IN

01:54:05.705 --> 01:54:08.141
ANY. INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT

01:54:08.208 --> 01:54:10.210
THAT WE HAVE BETWEEN THE U. S.

01:54:10.276 --> 01:54:13.947
OR ANY OF THE- RAIN FOREST- AND

01:54:14.013 --> 01:54:15.848
PROTECTED. WOULD PRODUCING

01:54:15.915 --> 01:54:18.818
AREAS OF THE WORLD. NO I FIND

01:54:18.885 --> 01:54:20.753
IT IN PARALLEL TO OURS FOR FREE

01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:24.624
COULD CONDUCT WHICH BANS.

01:54:24.691 --> 01:54:25.191
PROCUREMENT OF FURNITURE OUT

01:54:25.258 --> 01:54:27.427
LABOR. OKAY I THINK WE ARE

01:54:27.493 --> 01:54:29.429
LOOKING AT THE HOLE IN THE

01:54:29.495 --> 01:54:30.330
PAPER PRODUCTS AND STUFF LIKE

01:54:30.396 --> 01:54:33.366
THAT- THIS MAY SEEM MORE

01:54:33.433 --> 01:54:34.100
SYMBOLIC BUT I THINK THERE IS

01:54:34.167 --> 01:54:38.404
ACTUAL- FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCE.

01:54:38.471 --> 01:54:42.308
TO THIS- AND- I THINK BECAUSE

01:54:42.375 --> 01:54:44.978
OF THAT I WOULD BE. I HAVE

01:54:45.044 --> 01:54:46.512
CONCERNS THAT WE MAY BE

01:54:46.579 --> 01:54:49.549
EMBARKING- ONCE AGAIN INTO

01:54:49.616 --> 01:54:51.484
DISTURBING INTERNATIONAL TRADE

01:54:51.551 --> 01:54:54.921
AND OUR INFLUENCE IN ALL AREAS

01:54:54.988 --> 01:54:59.025
