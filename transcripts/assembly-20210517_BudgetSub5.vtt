DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I HAVE A

00:41:00.624 --> 00:41:04.461

00:41:04.528 --> 00:41:07.164
THE AMOUNT HAS DOUBLED FROM

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:09.600

SIX BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:17.141
QUESTIONS THE APPROXIMATE.

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:18.676
NUMBERS WITH THAT WAS CLOSER TO

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:20.077
THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND SO

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:20.711
CAN YOU GIVE US A LITTLE

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:23.747
INSIGHT INTO. HOW YOU. COME TO

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:25.683
THE CONCLUSION. THAT THIS IS

00:41:25.749 --> 00:41:30.221
THE ADEQUATE AMOUNT. SURE I'M

00:41:30.287 --> 00:41:32.122
HAPPY TO GIVE A HIGH LEVEL AND

00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:33.390
THEN I WOULD INVITE MY

00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:35.192
COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS TO EXPAND

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:38.128
A LITTLE BIT. SO BE IT AND

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:40.831
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE REALLY

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:43.334
TO ENHANCE THE POLICY UNIT THAT

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.402
COUNTY IN COORDINATION UNIT.

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:48.405
AND THE- CREATING AN OFFICE OF

00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:50.007
THE OMBUDSPERSON BUT IF

00:41:50.074 --> 00:41:51.909
MISSPELLED LIKE THAT FURTHER

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:54.445
AND PROVIDE MORE DETAILS THAT

00:41:54.511 --> 00:41:57.014
SHOULD. SURE YES I YOU KNOW I

00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:57.882
THINK THERE'S A REALLY

00:41:57.948 --> 00:41:59.250
CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS THAT

00:41:59.316 --> 00:42:00.618
HAPPENED WITH THE ADVOCATES

00:42:00.684 --> 00:42:02.620
BETWEEN THE TIME WE WERE HERE

00:42:02.686 --> 00:42:04.555
LAST I THINK IN EARLY MARCH-

00:42:04.622 --> 00:42:07.825
AND TODAY AND- ONE OF THE THERE

00:42:07.892 --> 00:42:09.326
WERE TWO DIFFERENT MODELS THAT

00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:12.229
THEY SHARED WITH US- ONE WAS

00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:14.198
LOOKING AT TEXAS AM AND THE

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:16.567
OTHER WAS- HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:17.701
OUR OWN FOSTER CARE ARMS

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:20.271
PERSONS OFFICE. I GUESS THE

00:42:20.337 --> 00:42:21.772
DISTINCTIONS THAT I WOULD SHARE

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:24.341
IS THAT FOR THE TEXAS MODEL-

00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:25.242
THERE REALLY IS A LOT OF

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:26.610
RESPONSIBILITIES AROUND

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:28.946
FACILITY OVERSIGHT OF WHICH IS

00:42:29.013 --> 00:42:30.447
A RESPONSIBILITY THAT IN OUR

00:42:30.514 --> 00:42:32.883
SYSTEM IN OUR STATE IS. IS THE

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:34.852
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SEC I

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:36.720
THINK WHERE WE REALLY WANTED TO

00:42:36.787 --> 00:42:39.823
INVEST- WAS ONE TO CREATE A

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.091
SEPARATE UNIT AT BEYONCE

00:42:41.158 --> 00:42:42.860
PERCENT WHICH INCLUDES THE UNIT

00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:44.361
CHIF THAT REPORTS TO A NEW

00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:46.230
DEPUTY DEPUTY DIRECTOR THAT

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:48.032
REPORTS TO THE- EXECUTIVE

00:42:48.098 --> 00:42:50.868
DIRECTOR. AND I THINK THAT THAT

00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:53.304
ALLOWS US TO HAVE THE ABILITY

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:54.872
TO RESPOND TO CALLS AND MAKE

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:56.273
THOSE REFERRALS THAT WE NEED TO

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.310
MAKE FOR THAT ROUGHLY TEN

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:04.048
THOUSAND YOUNG. PEOPLE WHO WILL

00:43:04.114 --> 00:43:05.849
BE. PAGE TEN AT IN OUT OF HOME

00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:08.452
PLACE- WOULD BE THIS OF THE

00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:11.588
ALMOST PERSONS. AND SO- I THINK

00:43:11.655 --> 00:43:12.656
THAT WITH THAT IS THAT ALSO

00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:14.058
SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY NEW

00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:15.159
AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY JUST

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:16.760
GETTING FEEDBACK IN TALKING TO

00:43:16.827 --> 00:43:18.128
SOME OF OUR LOCAL IMPLEMENTERS

00:43:18.195 --> 00:43:20.364
WAS. THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:22.399
THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR CON.

00:43:22.466 --> 00:43:24.802
TRACT FUNDS AND- YEAH THESE

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:27.871
ARE- IN MANY CASES.

00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:29.406
INTERVENTIONS THAT WE NEED TO

00:43:29.473 --> 00:43:30.741
EITHER ENHANCE IN COMMUNITIES

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:32.643
THAT DON'T HAVE THEM WHAT IS

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.578
SUPPORT- OUR LOCAL.

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:36.613
IMPLEMENTERS TO WORK REGIONALLY

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.749
NEEDS TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:39.917
DO SOMETHING NEW AND INNOVATIVE

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:41.418
THINGS AND SO I THINK WE ARE

00:43:41.485 --> 00:43:43.687
ALL SET- WE REALLY WANT TO

00:43:43.754 --> 00:43:45.322
FOCUS ON BEING ABLE TO GIVE

00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:47.057
DIRECTLY PROVIDE. THE KINDS OF

00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:48.359
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WAS

00:43:48.425 --> 00:43:52.262
NEEDED. TO SUPPORT OF THE-

00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:58.669
POPULATION. I'M SO THANKFUL FOR

THAT BACKGROUND OF HOW YOU. GOT

00:44:02.072 --> 00:44:02.940
TO THIS CONCLUSION AS I'M NOT

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:05.075
THERE THE SECOND EXAMPLE IN THE

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:07.144
STATE OF WASHINGTON ALSO. OUT

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:08.512
THERE AND THE NUMBER YOU'RE

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:10.047
LOOKING AT WHEN WE LAST SAW

00:44:10.114 --> 00:44:13.017
THIS WAS CLOSER TO. THIRTY

00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:15.119
MILLION DOLLARS- AND I'M NOT

00:44:15.185 --> 00:44:16.987
SURE HOW MANY FOR EXAMPLE I'M

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:18.689
NOT SURE HOW MANY RESOURCES WE

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:19.690
HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:21.692
BUT- IN THIS. PART OF

00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:23.594
HORSERACING BOARD WITHIN THAT

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.294
FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:44:24.361 --> 00:44:26.130
ANNUALLY WHICH IS TWICE THE

00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:28.665
AMOUNT FOR THIS OFFICE OF YOUTH

00:44:28.732 --> 00:44:29.466

SEE THAT. YOU THERE IS AN

00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:37.908
INCREASE I STILL QUESTION WHY

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:42.146
THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IS SO LOW- AT

00:44:42.212 --> 00:44:43.914
THIS MOMENT WHEN THE ADVOCATES

00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:31.582
YOU COME BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:33.951
WHAT WE REALLY NEEDIT SEVENTY

00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:34.851
MILLION DOLLARS OR WE REALLY

00:47:34.918 --> 00:47:37.421
NEEDED OF MUCH MORE THAN THAT

00:47:37.487 --> 00:47:39.189
RENDON DAN WHAT WE GET HERE AND

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:41.692
I KNOW ITS ONGOING COSTS AND-

00:47:41.758 --> 00:47:45.095
WE WHO CAME HERE IN TWENTY

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:47.297
TWELVE. NO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:48.899
YOU SPEND TOO MUCH AND ONGOING

00:47:48.966 --> 00:47:50.801
COST SO I CAN. I CAN APPRECIATE

00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:52.703
THAT. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:56.306
THAT- WE NEED TO WRAP UP RIGHT

00:47:56.373 --> 00:47:57.441
THE FIRST TIME AND SO IF YOU

00:47:57.507 --> 00:47:59.109

00:47:59.176 --> 00:48:00.344

US SOME- THAT THEY LET US KNOW

00:48:04.514 --> 00:48:07.050
WHAT EXACTLY YOU'RE GOING TO DO

00:48:07.117 --> 00:48:08.986
WITH THIS MONEY AND BUT MOST

00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:10.988
IMPORTANT HOW EFFECTIVE. THIS

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:14.324
WILL BE AN ENSURING THAT- THIS

00:48:14.391 --> 00:48:16.593
PROGRAMS WE TAKE IT DOWN. TO

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.864
LOWER LOVERS- MOST EFFICIENT.

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:21.898
CORRECT ONE POINT OF

00:48:21.965 --> 00:48:23.267
CLARIFICATION I JUST WANNA MAKE

00:48:23.333 --> 00:48:25.068
SURE THAT- FOR THE ACTUAL

00:48:25.135 --> 00:48:28.338
DELIVERY OF SERVICES THAT IS A

00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:29.506
FUNDING SOURCE THAT GOES

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:32.075
DIRECTLY TO THE LOCAL LEVEL-

00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:33.877

KNOW SOME OF THE EXACT NUMBERS

00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:37.581
BUT IN TERMS OF THAT THAT

THINK COMMUNITY RESTORATION SO

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:10.974
MAYBE THAT THAT MIGHT BE THAT

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:12.209
MAY BE PART OF THE CONFUSION

00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:14.711
WE'RE NOT CERTAIN WHAT YOUR

00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:16.446
DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:18.582
AND MAYBE WE NEED TO REVISIT

00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:20.617
THAT AND MAYBE START FROM THAT.

00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:23.387
OF BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I'M I'M

00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:25.522
I'M JUST CONFUSED I MEAN IF ALL

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:26.990
YOU'RE DOING IS SHUFFLING

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:29.092
PAPERS LIKE THE B. SEC WHICH

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:30.861
I'M NOT EVEN SURE WE NEED DOWN

00:50:30.927 --> 00:50:32.429
THE WIRE WEEK CRAZINESS LAYER

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:37.367
OF BUREAUCRACY AS I SEE BY. MY

00:50:37.434 --> 00:50:38.435
COLLEAGUES FROM ACROSS THE

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:41.438
AISLE. LOOKING AT ME WITH HSI'S

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:42.873
THROUGH A WIRE WE CREATING

00:50:42.939 --> 00:50:44.141
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T DO

00:50:44.207 --> 00:50:45.809
ANYTHING. THAT DOESN'T HELP

00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:47.878
MOVE THIS ALONG. IN A SEPARATE

00:50:47.944 --> 00:50:50.647
WAY SO IT MAY BE THAT. IT WOULD

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:53.383
REALLY BE GOOD TO TRY TO. TRY

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:55.986
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS. IT THAT

00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:59.923
YOU DO. AND WHAT OUTCOMES. THAT

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.658
MIGHT BE WHAT OUTCOMES ARE WE

SUPPOSED TO GET FROM THIS THIS

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.128
GROUP AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:06.663
CONFUSING PART IS RIGHT NOW.

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:09.900

THIS OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:51:19.643 --> 00:51:21.378

OUT. OUR SYSTEM. THANK YOU WELL

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.108
I THINK PART OF THE DISCONNECT

00:52:58.174 --> 00:53:00.243
IS WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IN FRONT

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:02.345
OF US RIGHT NOW IS THE BIG

00:53:02.412 --> 00:53:05.282
PICTURE OF WHAT THE SYSTEM

00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:06.283
ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO LOOK

00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:10.720
LIKE AND THE CONCERN. THAT I

00:53:10.787 --> 00:53:12.355
HAVE AND I'M GOING TO REPEAT

00:53:12.422 --> 00:53:14.457
MYSELF IS THAT IF WE JUST HAVE

00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:16.993
CREATED. THIS REALIGNMENT AS AS

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.361
A FUNCTION TO SAVE THE STATE

00:53:18.428 --> 00:53:19.796
MONEY AND PUSHED RESPONSIBILITY

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:21.898
THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAN THAN.

00:53:21.965 --> 00:53:23.867
WE ARE NOT NECESSARILY HEADED

00:53:23.934 --> 00:53:25.835
DOWN A PATH THAT WE WILL BE

00:53:25.902 --> 00:53:28.939
SUCCESSFUL. BUT WHAT WE NEED TO

00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:30.707
MAKE SURE AND WHAT I THINK.

00:53:30.774 --> 00:53:33.143
THIS AGENCY IS CRITICAL FOR IS

00:53:33.209 --> 00:53:35.712
ENSURING. THAT IT WON'T MATTER

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:39.349
WHERE. YOUTH IS IN THE STATE OF

00:53:39.416 --> 00:53:40.483
CALIFORNIA WHICH COUNTY OR

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.686
WHICH REGION THAT HERE WILL BE

00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:45.388
CONSISTENT SET OF OUTCOMES AND

00:53:45.455 --> 00:53:46.656
THAT'S WHY THIS AGENCY IS GOING

00:53:46.723 --> 00:53:48.291
TO BE SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:49.826
THEY'RE GONNA BE PROVIDING. THE

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:52.529
REVIEW THE BEST PRACTICES THAT

00:53:52.596 --> 00:53:54.064
THE THINK TANK ENVIRONMENT.

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:56.099
ULTIMATELY TO PROVIDE RESOURCES

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:58.435
AND HELP TO COUNTIES AND

00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:01.871
REGIONS TO SERVE YOU BETTER.

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:03.707
AND I STILL THINK OF THIS IS

00:54:03.773 --> 00:54:05.375
BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE'RE

00:54:05.442 --> 00:54:07.344
DOING HERE BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE.

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.245
THAT WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT. THE

00:54:09.312 --> 00:54:11.548
BREADTH OF THIS THROUGH THAT WE

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:14.651
SHOULD BE SETTING UP. A OUR

00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:17.687
SYSTEM AGENCY SOMETHING THAT IS

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:19.556
LOOKING OUT FOR ALL KIDS

00:54:19.623 --> 00:54:21.024
BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE THE

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:23.059
PROBLEM OF WE'RE STYLING KIDS

00:54:23.126 --> 00:54:24.594
IN DEPENDENCY AND DELINQUENCY

00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:25.562
THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND

00:54:25.629 --> 00:54:27.163
THOSE ARE IN OTHER SITUATIONS

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:28.465
REALLY HAVE NO PLACE TO GO AND

00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:31.067
NO NO SERVICES THAT THAT THEY

00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:33.303
CAN REAL. REALLY RELY ON AND

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:34.304
WHAT I THINK WHAT THIS

00:54:34.371 --> 00:54:35.739
COMMITTEE HAS TRIED TO DO WAS

00:54:35.805 --> 00:54:37.173
IS ARTICULATE TO THE

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.376
ADMINISTRATION THAT IF WE HAD A

00:54:39.442 --> 00:54:41.444
STRONGER CENTRALIZED FUNCTION

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:43.980
FOR ALL KIDS THAT PROMISE THE

00:54:44.047 --> 00:54:46.483
RIGHT RISK THAT WE COULD HAVE A

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:48.151
STRONGER SYSTEM TO SERVE THE

00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:48.718
KIDS BECAUSE WHETHER THEY'RE

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:51.021
HOMELESS OR THEIR INDEPENDENCY

00:54:51.087 --> 00:54:52.989
ORIENTAL IN QUINCY THESE ARE

00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:54.658
ALWAYS THE SAME KIDS OUT OF THE

00:54:54.724 --> 00:54:55.825
SAME COMMUNITIES OUT OF THE

00:54:55.892 --> 00:54:57.861
SAME FAMILIES OUT OF THE SAME

00:54:57.927 --> 00:55:03.033
SITUATIONS. COMPLICATED BECAUSE

00:55:03.099 --> 00:55:04.334
WERE DRIED OUT FEDERAL FUNDS

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:05.535
FOR DIFFERENT PIECES OF THIS

00:55:05.602 --> 00:55:07.070
BUT THAT IS SOMETHING. THAT AN

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:08.638
AGENCY LIKE THIS REALLY COULD

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:10.707
HELP SORT OUT AND FIGURE OUT.

00:55:10.774 --> 00:55:14.077
SO AS WE DEVELOP THIS. NEW

00:55:14.144 --> 00:55:17.447
MODEL OF. HAVING REALIGNED OUT

00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:18.848
OF THE COUNTIES AND HAVING

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:20.684
BROUGHT A LOT OF THIS FUNCTION

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:21.217
INTO THE HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:55:21.284 --> 00:55:24.354
SERVICES. CAPACITY THAT SHOULD

00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:26.156
LEAD US TO DIFFERENT OUTCOMES

00:55:26.222 --> 00:55:27.691
WITH RESPECT TO WHAT WE ARE

00:55:27.757 --> 00:55:29.125
ABLE TO DO WITH THESE KIDS TO

00:55:29.192 --> 00:55:31.061
HELP THEM AND TO SERVE THEM.

00:55:31.127 --> 00:55:31.828
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF LARGE

00:55:31.895 --> 00:55:33.096
QUESTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:35.565
REMAIN THERE ARE SOME. SOME

00:55:35.632 --> 00:55:37.600
SIGNIFICANT STRIDES THAT. DJJ

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:39.936
HAS MADE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SEX

00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:42.639
OFFENDER UNIT. AT HOW THAT GETS

00:55:42.706 --> 00:55:44.441
REPLICATED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:46.176
OR AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL. I'M

00:55:46.242 --> 00:55:47.777
NOT REAL CLEAR ON AND I'M NOT

00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:49.145
SURE ANYBODY REALLY IS EITHER

00:55:49.212 --> 00:55:49.713
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

00:55:49.779 --> 00:55:51.281
DEVELOP THAT CAPACITY. WAR

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:53.049
POTENTIALLY. KEEP SOMETHING

00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:54.017
LIKE THAT THE STATE BECAUSE

00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:55.752
IT'S NOT THAT MANY KIDS IN FROM

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:56.986
AN EFFICIENCY STANDPOINT I

00:55:57.053 --> 00:55:58.621
THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO THINK

00:55:58.688 --> 00:55:59.956
ABOUT WHAT THE STRUCTURE IS.

00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:00.957
AND THE BOTTOM LINE HAS TO BE

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:03.126
HOW WE'RE SERVING KIDS. HOW

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:04.427
WE'RE HELPING THEM SOLVE THE

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:05.829
PROBLEM THAT THEY HAVE FOUND

00:56:05.895 --> 00:56:07.764
THEMSELVES IN SO THAT THEY CAN.

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:09.365
FIX WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND

00:56:09.432 --> 00:56:10.867
GET BACK OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:13.136
IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY. AND SO

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:14.771
WE'RE LOOKING AT A PIECE OF IT

00:56:14.838 --> 00:56:17.607
HERE AND WE HAVE. ASKED FOR.

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:20.944
MORE RESOURCES MORE POSITIONS.

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:22.445
MORE FUNDING TO THIS AGENCY

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:24.814
BECAUSE OF I THINK OUR VISION

00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:26.149
FOR WHAT YOU CAN BE FOR THESE

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:27.751
KIDS AND THE CONSISTENCY THAT

00:56:27.817 --> 00:56:29.953
YOU'RE GONNA BE. REPRESENTING

00:56:30.019 --> 00:56:32.188
TH ACROSS CALIFORNIA IS REALLY

00:56:32.255 --> 00:56:34.624
GOING TO BE CRITICAL. TO THE

00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:36.025
SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS. ROSS

00:56:36.092 --> 00:56:39.362
THE STATE THAT'S SORT OF I

00:56:39.429 --> 00:56:41.598
THINK YOU'RE HEARING SOME OF

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:43.366
THE UNCERTAINTY HERE BECAUSE-

00:56:43.433 --> 00:56:45.301
IT'S HARD TO SEE WHAT. THE

00:56:45.368 --> 00:56:46.603
ENTIRE SYSTEM IS GOING TO LOOK

00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:48.271
LIKE NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE AND I

00:56:48.338 --> 00:56:50.240
DON'T KNOW THAT ANYBODY. REALLY

00:56:50.306 --> 00:56:52.142
HAS AN ANSWER TO THAT YET AND

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:54.177
UNFORTUNATELY. THAT MEANS WE'RE

00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:55.345
GOING TO BE STEPPING THROUGH

00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:57.514
AND LEARNING AS WE GO AND

00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.415
WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON THE KIDS.

00:56:59.482 --> 00:57:00.517
IN THE SYSTEM WHO ARE IN THE

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.485
SYSTEM NOW AND SOON TO BE IN

00:57:02.552 --> 00:57:04.721
THE SYSTEM. THAT THAT'S WHAT'S

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:06.790
CRITICAL IT IS AND IF WE SET UP

00:57:06.856 --> 00:57:07.991
THE SYSTEM MORE AS WE EXPLORE

00:57:08.057 --> 00:57:09.793
IT. AND WE LEAVE KIDS BEHIND OR

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:11.361
WERE NOT SERVING THEM THAT'S

00:57:11.427 --> 00:57:12.362
REALLY GOING TO BE ULTIMATELY

00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:14.330
THE TRAGEDY. SO WE WANT TO MAKE

00:57:14.397 --> 00:57:16.199
SURE THAT YOUR AGENCY IS

00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:18.802
FUNDED. APPROPRIATELY TO BE

00:57:18.868 --> 00:57:20.069
ABLE TO PROVIDE THE BROADER

00:57:20.136 --> 00:57:22.205
OVERSIGHT. THE CONNECTIONS TO

00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:25.074
HELP. TO ENSURE SUCCESS AT THE

00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:26.409
COUNTY LEVEL AND POTENTIALLY

00:57:26.476 --> 00:57:27.777
REGIONAL LEVEL BECAUSE NOT

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:28.578
EVERY COUNTY IS GOING TO BE

00:57:28.645 --> 00:57:30.446
ABLE TO AFFORD. TO IMPLEMENT

00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:31.614
WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE ASKING THEM

00:57:31.681 --> 00:57:32.382
TO IMPLEMENT A WITH THEY'RE

00:57:32.448 --> 00:57:35.084
GOING TO NEED TO. DEPENDING ON

00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:35.718
THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE KIDS THAT

00:57:35.785 --> 00:57:37.554
ARE IN THE- SO I THINK THAT'S

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:39.689
THE- THAT'S THE DISCONNECT IS

00:57:39.756 --> 00:57:40.790
WE'RE LOOKING AT A LARGER

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:42.792
SYSTEMS CHANGE. AND KIND OF

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:43.560
PUSHING BACK ON THE

00:57:43.626 --> 00:57:45.328
ADMINISTRATION. BECAUSE IT

00:57:45.395 --> 00:57:46.996
DOESN'T ALWAYS SEEM LIKE THAT

00:57:47.063 --> 00:57:48.765
LEVEL OF SYSTEM CHANGES WHAT IS

00:57:48.832 --> 00:57:50.400
BEING TALKED ABOUT BUT THAT IS

00:57:50.466 --> 00:57:52.302
WHAT WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN.

00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:56.072
WELL I AM I KNOW. OF IS FIVE

00:57:56.139 --> 00:57:56.773
EIGHT. USING SORT OF THE

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.742
COLLECTIVE WE HEAR. AND I THINK

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:00.710
THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THE

00:58:00.777 --> 00:58:01.678
QUESTIONS COME FROM THERE WERE

00:58:01.744 --> 00:58:02.846
SOME OF THE DISCONNECT COMES

00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:05.715
FROM SO FOR US FINDING A WAY TO

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:06.850
MAKE SURE THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE

00:58:06.916 --> 00:58:09.819
THE BIGGER PICTURE. IN MIND AS

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:10.553
WE'RE GOING THROUGH THESE AND

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.422
HAVE THAT INFORMATION. SO WHAT

00:58:12.488 --> 00:58:13.556
IS THE REST OF THIS GOING TO

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:14.224
LOOK LIKE BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.491
SENDING A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY

00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:17.227
IN A LOT OF RESOURCE. DATA

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:20.029
LOCAL LEVEL. AND ENSURING THAT

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:21.397
THOSE LOCAL LEVELS ARE

00:58:21.464 --> 00:58:23.933
PERFORMING TO A PARTICULAR

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.635
STANDARD. IS THIS AGENCY.

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:26.936
THAT'S WHAT'S ULTIMATELY KEY

00:58:27.003 --> 00:58:29.038
HERE M. AND THAT'S WE'RE GONNA

00:58:29.105 --> 00:58:30.206
BE TRACKING THAT'S WORKING TO

00:58:30.273 --> 00:58:31.441
BE LOOKING TO AND THERE'S

00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:33.243
REALLY A LOT AT STAKE HERE FOR

00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:34.444
THE FUTURE OF OUR KIDS IF WE

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:36.112
SET THIS UP CORRECTLY. AND IF

00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:38.514
WE DON'T IF WE JUST TRY TO SAVE

00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:39.582
THE STATE MONEY THEN WE WILL BE

00:58:39.649 --> 00:58:40.783
FAILING THOSE KIDS DOWN THE

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:42.385
LINE. THAT'S THE SENSITIVITY

00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:44.053
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.788
THE RIGHT SIZED AT THIS POINT.

00:58:45.855 --> 00:58:47.290
AND ARE WE MAKING THE

00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:49.559
INVESTMENTS NECESSARY. TO

00:58:49.626 --> 00:58:51.828
ENSURE THAT CONTINUITY AND THAT

00:58:51.895 --> 00:58:53.963
HELPED. STATEWIDE SO THINK

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:55.531
THAT'S WHERE IT COMES TO AN END

00:58:55.598 --> 00:58:57.500
I AM NOT COMPLETELY SURE AS TO

00:58:57.567 --> 00:58:58.534
HAVE BEEN TALKING TO MISPRISION

00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:00.270
ABOUT THIS ABOUT SOME OF MY

00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:01.771
CONCERNS OF IMPLEMENTATION.

00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:05.308
BOTH WITHIN THIS AGENCY AND-

00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:06.676
KIND OF BIGGER PICTURE WITH A

00:59:06.743 --> 00:59:08.878
LOT OF THE- THE SERVICES HAT

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:10.280
I'M NOT SURE HAVE NOT REALLY

00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:12.448
BEEN SETTLED ON. HOW WE'RE

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:13.049
GOING TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ARE

00:59:13.116 --> 00:59:14.684
BEING IMPLEMENTED. ON A

00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:16.886
STATEWIDE BASIS. SO WE'VE GOT

00:59:16.953 --> 00:59:18.288
WE'VE GOT PIECES OF IT AND

00:59:18.354 --> 00:59:19.389
RIGHT NOW WE'RE ONLY LOOKING

00:59:19.455 --> 00:59:22.258
AT. A PIECE OF IT BUT WE NEED

00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:22.825
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAS THE

00:59:22.892 --> 00:59:26.596
CAPACITY. TO BE THAT. OVER

00:59:26.663 --> 00:59:31.167
ARCHING. RESOURCE HELP. TO

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:35.605
ENSURE A CONSISTENT APPROACH TO

00:59:35.672 --> 00:59:37.173
KIDS ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.008
IF IT MATTERS WHAT COUNTY

00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:40.910
THEY'RE IN BUT WHAT REGION

00:59:40.977 --> 00:59:43.212
THERE IN FOR THEIR SUCCESS THEN

00:59:43.279 --> 00:59:44.981
THIS WILL NOT HAVE BEEN A

00:59:45.048 --> 00:59:55.758
SUCCESSFUL EXERCISE. AT THE

00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:57.226
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ONE OF

00:59:57.293 --> 01:00:08.304
COMMENTED MR STONE. COMMENTS.

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:09.572
BUT THE LAST THING THAT I WOULD

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:11.174
SAY I JUST I DIDN'T MENTION IT

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.108
TODAY BUT WHEN WE WERE HERE

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:14.577

AT LEAST FRIENDS LIVE THANK

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:20.283
YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES BUT THE

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:21.117
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THEY

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:24.287
HAVE- SO I JUST WANT YOU TO

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:25.855

WE HAVE STRONG PARTNERSHIPS

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:31.627
WITH THOSE AT. ALL WHICH I

01:00:31.694 --> 01:00:34.130
THINK MIGHT BE HEADING OUT YEAH

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:35.531
BUT IT'S THAT WE WOULD REALLY

01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:38.067
WANT TO DRAW THEM IN AND THAT'S

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:39.669
WHERE WE SEE THE SYSTEMS CHANGE

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:41.738
FEES BECAUSE IT ALSO MEANS WE

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:43.873
CAN DO THINGS BETTER- AS WELL

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.808

THE ADMINISTRATION. UNDER THAT

01:01:03.926 --> 01:01:05.628
THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:06.896

THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A RANGE

100% IF THERE'S A SORT OF SCALE

01:21:31.753 --> 01:21:32.287
AND WHAT IS THAT SKILL LOOK

01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:34.356
LIKE. TO MEET THOSE NEEDS TO

01:21:34.422 --> 01:21:35.257
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THIS

01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:37.559
IN AN EQUITABLE WAY AND SO THE

CLARITY IS WELL ON THE TWO

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:21.903
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:22.971
DOLLARS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

01:22:23.038 --> 01:22:24.472
THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN PUSHING

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:28.877
FOR- IS FOR MORE FUNDING FOR PS

01:22:28.943 --> 01:22:33.548
PS- MONIES BECAUSE OUR CITIES

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:34.549
OR OUR TRIBES ARE SPECIAL

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:36.384
DISTRICTS THAT ARE TRYING TO

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:41.122
MITIGATE WILDFIRES- AND- TRYING

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:43.224
TO HELP THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:45.393
SERVICE THEIR COMMUNITIES- ARE

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.128
OUT OF POWER WHEN PUBLIC SAFETY

01:22:47.195 --> 01:22:49.631
POWER SHUT OFFS OCCUR AND THOSE

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:50.699
ARE HAPPENING MORE AND MORE

01:22:50.765 --> 01:22:54.002
FREQUENTLY- AND THEN WE ALSO

01:22:54.069 --> 01:22:56.338
EXPECT THAT THERE WILL ALSO BE-

01:22:56.404 --> 01:22:57.706
SOME ROLLING BLACKOUTS THIS

01:22:57.772 --> 01:22:59.774
SUMMER WITH THE- DRYNESS AND

01:22:59.841 --> 01:23:02.077
HEAT THAT WE'RE EXPECTING AND

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:04.546
MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ALREADY

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:06.281
KNOW THAT THE PAST COUPLE OF

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:08.216
YEARS WHETHER IT WAS LAST YEAR

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:09.184
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OR- THE

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:11.052
PREVIOUS YEAR FIFTY MILLION- IT

01:23:11.119 --> 01:23:13.555
WASN'T ENOUGH. NUMBER CITIES

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:15.824
THAT THE NEED FAR EXCEEDED THE

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:18.560
RESOURCES AVAILABLE SO CAN THAT

01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:20.128
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TELL

01:23:20.195 --> 01:23:22.731
ME WHAT ARE CITIES- WHO ARE

01:23:22.797 --> 01:23:25.567
LOOKING FOR RESOURCES IN THE

01:23:25.633 --> 01:23:28.103
FORM OF GRANTS FOR PS PS EVENTS

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:29.471
INCLUDING BUYING BACK UP

01:23:29.537 --> 01:23:33.108
GENERATORS- OUR BATTERY PACKS-

01:23:33.174 --> 01:23:35.443
COULD THEY REQUEST SUPPORT AND

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:39.814
RESOURCES OR OR WOULD THERE. BE

01:23:39.881 --> 01:23:40.415
GRANTED BILLABLE THROUGH THIS

01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:44.719
PROGRAM FOR THAT. I'LL START A

01:23:44.786 --> 01:23:45.854
MINUTE AND THEN I'LL PASS IT

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.589
ON- TO CALAVERAS MY

01:23:47.655 --> 01:23:48.690
UNDERSTANDING IT IS THIS IS

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.091
MORE HARDENING OF

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:53.928
INFRASTRUCTURE- TO MITIGATE

01:23:53.995 --> 01:23:56.664
AGAINST FUTURE FLOODS FIRES

01:23:56.731 --> 01:24:00.368
EARTHQUAKES- BUT- I'M NOT

01:24:00.435 --> 01:24:03.037
CERTAIN THAT THAT- THAT PUBLIC

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:06.541
SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF-

01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:08.009
RESOURCES WHICH WOULD BE

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:10.412
DIRECTLY- INCORPORATED AND INTO

01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:13.281
THE- THOUGH THOUGH THERE THERE

01:24:13.348 --> 01:24:15.250
MAY BE SOME SEEM TANGENTIAL

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:18.953
BETTER BENEFITS- I'M NOT SURE-

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:19.554
YES HAS ANYTHING TO ADD ON TO

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:22.924
THAT. AND THANKS SSEMBLY

01:24:22.991 --> 01:24:25.894
MEMBER- FOR THE QUESTION THIS

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.862
IS MARK RTG. I THINK THE ANSWER

01:24:27.929 --> 01:24:30.832
ON THIS IS THAT- THROUGH ABOUT

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:32.700
ABOUT- PREPARE CALIFORNIA'S

01:24:32.767 --> 01:24:35.270
ISSUE THAT IF YOU IT'S REALLY

01:24:35.336 --> 01:24:37.272
COMMUNITIES LOOKING AT. THERE

01:24:37.338 --> 01:24:40.041
RISKS ALL ACROSS THE BOARD

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:41.276
OFTEN AT ALL HAZARDS

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:44.345
STANDPOINT- EVERY PART OF THE

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:45.747
STATE HAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:47.949
RISKS SIGNATURE. THEY HAVE

01:24:48.016 --> 01:24:49.818
DIFFERENT VULNERABILITY LEVELS

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:53.988
AND IN SOME AREAS- POWER COULD

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:56.825
BE OUT. THERE DRIVING FOR

01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:59.327
PROFITABILITY IN SOME OTHER

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:00.795
PARTS OF THE STATE IT'S NOT A

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:02.197
LOT THAT'S WHY THIS PARTICULAR

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:04.732
PROGRAM IS REALLY NOT DESIGNED

01:25:04.799 --> 01:25:07.302
TO BE ONE HAZARD AND FOCUS ON

01:25:07.368 --> 01:25:09.370
ONE HAZARD BUT TO LOOK AT A

01:25:09.437 --> 01:25:11.739
BROAD. OFF MORE- YOU KNOW

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:13.541
COLLABORATIVE WAY BUT THE FACT

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:15.143
THE MATTER IS WE WOULD SAY IN

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.078
THIS INITIATIVE BACK INSTEAD OF

01:25:17.145 --> 01:25:19.848
DOING A ONE OFF BY EIGHT EIGHTY

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:22.750
UP- A GENERATOR WHAT WE WOULD

01:25:22.817 --> 01:25:24.752

POWER NEEDS- THAT WAY IT COULD

01:25:50.345 --> 01:25:51.913
BE A GENERATOR BUT HAS THAT

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:55.183
GENERATOR FIT INTO THE LARGER-

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:56.417

OVERALL. SO THEN YOU CAN

01:26:00.688 --> 01:26:03.258
MAXIMIZE THE EFFORT ABOUT ONE

01:26:03.324 --> 01:26:04.926
TRIBAL GOVERNMENT OR ONE LOCAL

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.494

THE TECHNOLOGY AND DATA

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:10.491
ANALYTICS I THINK THAT'S

01:27:10.558 --> 01:27:13.861

01:32:42.823 --> 01:32:44.325
SYSTEM IN MAXIMIZING EVERY

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:45.993

THERE THEY COULD BECOME FROM

01:32:51.198 --> 01:32:53.434
USDA. DEPENDING ON WHEREVER

01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:55.670
THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE. WE

01:32:55.736 --> 01:32:57.138

01:53:11.117 --> 01:53:12.118
CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THIS

01:53:12.185 --> 01:53:14.154
PROPOSAL THAT WILL NEED TO BE

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:15.522
ADDRESSED BUT WE LOOK FORWARD

01:53:15.588 --> 01:53:16.789
TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATOR

01:53:16.856 --> 01:53:17.924
AS WELL AS THE TEACHER

01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:19.659

01:53:26.499 --> 01:53:28.234
KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

01:53:28.301 --> 01:53:28.768
I NEED ONLY WITH A LOT AND

01:53:28.835 --> 01:53:30.503
OFFICE- SO WE DO FOR THAT THIS.

01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:31.571
MERITS CAN. AS IT WOULD REAL TO

01:53:31.638 --> 01:53:33.673
LOWER IN AND- I'M AT THIS POINT

01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:35.008
WE DON'T HAVE THE TRAILER BILL

01:53:35.074 --> 01:53:36.609
LANGUAGE AND SO THERE ARE KEY

01:53:36.676 --> 01:53:37.744
QUESTIONS AND WE WOULD

01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:39.512
SUMMARIZE FOR OR BRING FOR TIER

01:53:39.579 --> 01:53:42.615
TENSION. THE FIRST IS WHAT

01:53:42.682 --> 01:53:44.250
HAPPENS IF THE PARTICIPATION

01:53:44.317 --> 01:53:46.252
RATE IS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED.

01:53:46.319 --> 01:53:47.854
RESULTING IN A LARGER REDUCTION

01:53:47.921 --> 01:53:49.889
IN FINE AND FEE REVENUE THAN.

01:53:49.956 --> 01:53:51.891
ANTICIPATED TO NEED IT. THE

01:53:51.958 --> 01:53:53.126
SECOND QUESTION IS HOW MUCH

01:53:53.193 --> 01:53:54.661
FUNDING WOULD BE PROVIDED FOR

01:53:54.727 --> 01:53:55.862
PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION AND

01:53:55.929 --> 01:53:58.031
OUTRAGE COSTS. THE THIRD

01:53:58.097 --> 01:53:59.632
QUESTION IS HOW WOULD THE BACK

01:53:59.699 --> 01:54:01.234
FULL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BE

01:54:01.301 --> 01:54:03.002
DISTRIBUTED. AND THE FOURTH

01:54:03.069 --> 01:54:05.438
QUESTION IS HOW WOULD THE

01:54:05.505 --> 01:54:07.840
PROGRAM OPERATE IN TANDEM- WITH

01:54:07.907 --> 01:54:09.242

01:54:11.377 --> 01:54:13.146
INFRACTIONS AND ABILITY TO PAY

01:54:13.213 --> 01:54:14.914
DETERMINATION STATEWIDE. AND SO

01:54:14.981 --> 01:54:16.950
ANSWERS TO TESE QUESTIONS ARE

01:54:17.016 --> 01:54:18.651
CRITICAL TO ALLOW THE

01:54:18.718 --> 01:54:20.153
LEGISLATURE TO WAIVE THIS

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:21.454
PROPOSAL AGAINST OTHER

01:54:21.521 --> 01:54:23.356
PRIORITIES. AS WELL AS TO

01:54:23.423 --> 01:54:24.924
ENSURE THAT IT IS STRUCTURED

01:54:24.991 --> 01:54:26.392
AND OPERATED IN A MANNER

01:54:26.459 --> 01:54:28.294
CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE

01:54:28.361 --> 01:54:30.296
PRIORITIES AND EXPECTATIONS.

01:54:30.363 --> 01:54:31.331
THE FINAL THING THAT WE WOULD

01:54:31.397 --> 01:54:33.366
KNOW IS THAT- IT IS POSSIBLE

01:54:33.433 --> 01:54:35.235
THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY NEED

01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:36.269
TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF

01:54:36.336 --> 01:54:38.371
REVENUE REDUCTIONS TO OTHER

01:54:38.438 --> 01:54:40.139

01:54:40.206 --> 01:54:41.374
CONFINING THE REVENUE AND

01:54:41.441 --> 01:54:43.142
SUPPORT- ENDED THE LEGISLATURE

01:54:43.209 --> 01:54:44.577
DOES HAVE VERY OPTIONS VARIOUS

01:54:44.644 --> 01:54:46.312
OPTIONS FOR DOING SO- BUT A

01:54:46.379 --> 01:54:47.847
BACK FILL FOR THEM IS NOT

01:54:47.914 --> 01:54:52.385

OBJECTIVE WOULD BE FOR A

01:57:04.984 --> 01:57:05.985
PERSPECTIVE EARLY TO BE

01:57:06.052 --> 01:57:07.320
PROVIDED THROUGH THE ABILITY TO

01:57:08.855 --> 01:57:10.423
INDIVIDUALS WOULD APPLY TO HAVE

01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:11.991
THEIR FINES AND FEES ARE

01:57:12.058 --> 01:57:17.797
REDUCED BY AT LEAST. BY 50% I'M

01:57:17.864 --> 01:57:18.331
SO THAT WOULD BE THE PLAN

01:57:18.398 --> 01:57:21.134

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.769
THAT THERE IS- SOME SORT OF

01:57:22.835 --> 01:57:25.238

BE INTERESTED AND MORE ROBUST.

01:57:27.507 --> 01:57:30.143
DISCUSSIONS UP 50% IS HELPFUL

01:57:30.209 --> 01:57:31.377
BUT FOR SOME OF OUR LOW INCOME

01:57:31.444 --> 01:57:33.045
FOLKS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE.

01:57:33.112 --> 01:57:35.348
ENOUGH OUT THERE AND SO I DO

01:57:35.415 --> 01:57:37.517
THINK AS WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE

01:57:37.583 --> 01:57:39.252
A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM OF THE

01:57:39.318 --> 01:57:39.786
THING THAT WE NEED TO LOOK

01:57:39.852 --> 01:57:43.289
INTO. I WOULD THESE BE SOME

01:57:43.356 --> 01:57:44.424
PLANS THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE.

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:45.725
WELL I UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO

01:57:45.792 --> 01:57:48.895
HAVE A PLAN TO ALSO BACK. AS

01:57:48.961 --> 01:57:49.462
SADDAM SERVICES THAT WE HAVE

01:57:49.529 --> 01:57:52.098
OUT THERE. ANY QUESTIONS OR

01:57:52.165 --> 01:57:53.733
COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. MR

STILL. WELL CERTAINLY ON THAT

01:57:59.038 --> 01:57:59.405
LAST QUESTION A DEBT

01:57:59.472 --> 01:58:02.442
FORGIVENESS PROGRAM. THIS IS

01:58:02.508 --> 01:58:04.143
BECAUSE IT'S COME UP I THINK IN

01:58:04.210 --> 01:58:05.812
IN CONTEXT OF THE PANDEMIC IT'S

01:58:05.878 --> 01:58:07.780
JUST A BIT OF A BANDAIDAND

01:58:07.847 --> 01:58:08.781
WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS

01:58:08.848 --> 01:58:10.883
TAKE  HARD LOOK AT THE FINES

01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:12.185
AND FEES ACROSS CALIFORNIA

01:58:12.251 --> 01:58:14.454
WE'VE TOO LONG USED FINES AND

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:16.389
FEES OR AS WAYS OF FUNDING

01:58:16.456 --> 01:58:18.491
PROGRAMS. YEAH THAT'S ONE OF

01:58:18.558 --> 01:58:19.459
THE REASONS IT'S REALLY GOTTEN

01:58:19.525 --> 01:58:20.726
OUT OF HAND I THINK THE CHIEF

01:58:20.793 --> 01:58:21.861
JUSTICE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND

01:58:21.928 --> 01:58:23.529
THAT. SO THAT INVESTMENT THAT

01:58:23.596 --> 01:58:25.231
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS HAVING

01:58:25.298 --> 01:58:26.466
A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT

01:58:26.532 --> 01:58:28.100
FINES AND FEES WHERE WE'VE

01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:29.068
GOTTEN WHERE WE'VE GOTTEN AND

01:58:29.135 --> 01:58:32.071
HOW. ULTIMATELY WE FUND THAT. I

01:58:32.138 --> 01:58:33.539
JUST WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT

01:58:33.606 --> 01:58:35.408

01:58:37.710 --> 01:58:40.213
MORE DETAIL AROUND. WHAT THOSE

01:58:40.279 --> 01:58:42.315
PROPOSALS ARE FOR REDUCING THE

01:58:42.381 --> 01:58:44.183
BACKLOG WE'VE HELD HEARINGS.

01:58:44.250 --> 01:58:46.519
WITH THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IN AND

01:58:46.586 --> 01:58:47.086
THERE WEREN'T NOT A LOT OF

01:58:47.153 --> 01:58:49.622
ANSWERS THAT CAME. OUT OF THOSE

01:58:49.689 --> 01:58:54.527
DISCUSSIONS SO FOR US TO HAVE.

01:58:54.594 --> 01:58:57.096
A LOT MORE DIRECT. INPUT AND

01:58:57.163 --> 01:58:59.465
OVERSIGHT IN THOSE PROGRAMS AND

01:58:59.532 --> 01:59:02.001
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE. IS

01:59:02.068 --> 01:59:03.102
GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT I'M

01:59:03.169 --> 01:59:05.037
NOT TALKING AT ALL AT THE SIXTY

01:59:05.104 --> 01:59:06.539
MILLION DOLLARS WE NEED TO HELP

01:59:06.606 --> 01:59:08.741

REDUCING THE THEIR BACKLOGS.

01:59:11.143 --> 01:59:14.413

ANSWERS ABOUT WHAT. THEY WOULD

01:59:18.518 --> 01:59:19.051
BE DOING OR HOW THEY WOULD BE

01:59:19.118 --> 01:59:20.553
DOING IT. AND THERE'S A LITTLE

THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY

01:59:28.461 --> 01:59:29.395
I THINK THIS IS AN AREA WE WANT

01:59:29.462 --> 01:59:34.100

FIRST ELEMENT IS THE PROCESS

02:54:53.749 --> 02:54:54.884
FOR HANDLING ANY EMPLOYEE

AND THE SECOND RELATES TO BODY

02:54:58.521 --> 02:55:00.356
WORN CAMERAS SO MOVING INTO THE

02:55:00.423 --> 02:55:02.458
FIRST- WE FIND THAT THE LEVEL

02:55:02.525 --> 02:55:04.227
OF RESOURCES NEEDED TO SUPPORT

02:55:04.293 --> 02:55:08.164
THE CHANGES- THE ENTIRE AS-

STAFF MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATION

02:55:08.831 --> 02:55:11.934
PROCESS- AT THE END ISSUE HERE

02:55:12.001 --> 02:55:14.670
IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN-

02:55:14.737 --> 02:55:16.239
SPECIFICALLY THE NUMBER OF

02:55:16.305 --> 02:55:17.440
CASES THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL

02:55:17.506 --> 02:55:19.375

02:55:19.442 --> 02:55:21.644
STAFF TIME. REQUIRED HER

02:55:21.711 --> 02:55:23.980
INVESTIGATION- PER CASE IS VERY

02:55:24.046 --> 02:55:26.282
UNCLEAR THIS IS BECAUSE THE

02:55:26.349 --> 02:55:27.316
DETAILS OF THE PROCESS ARE

02:55:27.383 --> 02:55:29.552
STILL SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION-

02:55:29.619 --> 02:55:32.321
AND I IN ONGOING LITIGATION.

02:55:32.388 --> 02:55:34.423
THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT WERE

02:55:34.490 --> 02:55:36.392
USED TO FORM THE BASIS OF THAT

02:55:36.459 --> 02:55:37.927
WORKLOAD ESTIMATES FOR THE

02:55:37.994 --> 02:55:40.096
PROPOSALS. CAME FROM YEARS IN

02:55:40.162 --> 02:55:41.631
WHICH THE INMATE POPULATION WAS

02:55:41.697 --> 02:55:46.702
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN. IT

02:55:46.769 --> 02:55:47.336
IS NOW AND IS PROJECTED TO BE.

02:55:47.403 --> 02:55:49.438
I CDCR. HAS HAD THINK OF IN.

02:55:49.505 --> 02:55:51.707
THE TIME CURRENT. IN FACT IT

02:55:51.774 --> 02:55:53.542
INDICATES THAT- DRAMATICALLY

02:55:53.609 --> 02:55:54.744
UNDERESTIMATED THE TIME IT

02:55:54.810 --> 02:55:58.581
NEEDED IN ITS ORIGINAL NINETEEN

02:55:58.648 --> 02:55:59.081
TWENTY B. C. P. FOR THIS

02:55:59.148 --> 02:56:01.217
PROCESS. AND MOVE MORE OVERSEAS

02:56:01.284 --> 02:56:02.285
HERE HAS REPORTED THAT IT'S

02:56:02.351 --> 02:56:03.686
LOOKING FOR EFFICIENCIES TO

02:56:03.753 --> 02:56:04.854
REDUCE STAFF TIME PER

02:56:04.921 --> 02:56:06.389
INVESTIGATION SUCH AS USING

02:56:06.455 --> 02:56:07.757
VIDEO CONFERENCE TO CONDUCT

02:56:07.823 --> 02:56:08.791
INTERVIEWS RATHER THAN HAVING

STAFF TRAVEL TO INSTITUTIONS.

02:56:11.894 --> 02:56:14.163
BUT- SO AGAIN THAT DAY IT'S NOT

02:56:14.230 --> 02:56:15.197
CLEAR THAT THOSE HAVE BEEN

02:56:15.264 --> 02:56:17.767
IMPLEMENTED ARE FACTORED INTO

02:56:17.833 --> 02:56:19.635
THE TIME- THAT'S BEING BUDGETED

02:56:19.702 --> 02:56:21.404
FOR HERE. AND FINALLY WITH THE

02:56:21.470 --> 02:56:22.872
EXPANSION OF VIDEO SURVEILLANCE

02:56:22.939 --> 02:56:24.106
SYSTEMS TO MORE AND MORE

02:56:24.173 --> 02:56:25.841
PRESENTS WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE

02:56:25.908 --> 02:56:27.276
A TIME FOR INVESTIGATION GO

02:56:27.343 --> 02:56:29.111
DOWN AS WELL BECAUSE IT SHOULD-

02:56:29.178 --> 02:56:31.447
PROVIDES. MORE CLEAR EVIDENCE

02:56:31.514 --> 02:56:31.981
WITH WHICH TO HANDLE THESE

02:56:32.048 --> 02:56:34.150
INVESTIGATIONS. SO WE RECOMMEND

02:56:34.216 --> 02:56:37.186
APPROVING BOTH THE TOTAL THE

02:56:37.253 --> 02:56:38.621
NINETEEN MILLION AUGMENTATION
