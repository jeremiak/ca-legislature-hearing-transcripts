00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:35.795
AND IF YOU HAVEN'T YET YOU

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:38.064
LIKELY WILL AND IF YOU HAVEN'T

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:39.632
YET YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:41.534
SOMEONE ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY A

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:43.269
COLLEAGUE OF FRIENDS YOU KNOW

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.570
FAMILY CARE GIVERS THAT ARE

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:46.105
GOING THROUGH THESE ISSUES RIGHT

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:47.707
NOW IN THEIR LIVES.

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:48.975
IN FACT IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S AN

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.977
ESTIMATED FOUR POINT FIVE

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:52.411
MILLION FAMILY CARE GIVERS THAT

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:53.713
PROVIDE SERVICES WORTH AN

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.083
ESTIMATED FIFTY SEVEN BILLION

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.117
DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

00:06:58.184 --> 00:06:58.885
CALIFORNIA LIKE THE REST OF THE

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:01.487
COUNTRY IS GROWING RAPIDLY --

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:03.055
THE AGING POPULATION IS GROWING

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:04.557
RAPIDLY OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:06.359
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SIXTY FIVE

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:07.727
AND OVER IN THE STATE WILL GROW

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:09.595
BY FOUR MILLION AND IT'S A TREND

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:10.863
THAT CONTINUES.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.398
INTO THE TIME WHEN I WILL BE IN

00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:13.699
OLDER ADULTS SO I'M PART OF THE

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:15.034
SILVER SNOBBY AS WELL THIS IS

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.736
NOT A ISSUE THAT'S JUST

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:18.271
RESTRICTED TO PEOPLE.

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:19.472
THAT ARE OLDER NOW OUR ON THE

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:22.341
COST OF BECOMING OLDER IT'S KIDS

00:07:22.408 --> 00:07:24.010
AND GENERATIONS TO COME.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:25.945
AS OUR POPULATION AGES WE ARE

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.280
SEEING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:29.248
OF OLDER ADULTS THAT NEED LONG

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:30.683
TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.518
OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE SIXTY

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:33.986
FIVE AND OLDER 70% WILL NEED

00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:36.756
CARE TO REMAIN SAFELY AT HOME.

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:38.024
AND UNFORTUNATELY THE COST OF

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.426
CARE IS ON AFFORDABLE BUT ALL TO

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:41.694
ALL BUT THE WEALTHIEST OF

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:42.695
CALIFORNIANS AND MY COLLEAGUES

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:44.831
WILL GO INTO SOME MORE DETAIL

00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:45.998
ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS.

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.333
AND WE DON'T HAVE IS A STATE A

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.801
PROGRAM THAT WILL COVER THOSE

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:50.102
COSTS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:51.871
MEDICARE HAS A WONDERFUL HEALTH

00:07:51.938 --> 00:07:53.840
CARE PROGRAM BUT IT COVERS ONLY

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:55.041
LIMITED LONG TERM CARE.

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:56.642
MEDI CAL DOES COVER LONG TERM

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.211
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND IN

00:07:58.277 --> 00:07:59.812
FACT AS THE PRIMARY PAYER OF L.

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:01.581
TSS IN THE STATE.

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.416
BUT IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE TO

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:04.183
EXTREMELY LOW INCOME PEOPLE OR

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.117
TO MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE AFTER

00:08:05.184 --> 00:08:06.853
THEY'VE EXHAUSTED ALL OF THEIR

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:08.287
INCOME AND ASSETS TO QUALIFY FOR

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:09.288
THE PROGRAM.

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.157
AND EVEN THEN IT DOESN'T COVER

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:12.425
EVERYTHING THAT PEOPLE NEED.

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:14.594
SO IT'S IN THIS CONTEXT THAT

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.928
FAMILY CARE GIVER STEP UP.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.396
AND THEY PROVIDE THE CRITICAL

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:19.031
FUNCTION THAT THEY DO --

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:20.199
THEY HELP IN A WIDE VARIETY OF

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:22.368
WAYS LARGE AND SMALL THEY HELP

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:23.769
WITH RUNNING ERRANDS AND GETTING

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:24.804
TO DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS THEY

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:26.739
HELP WITH ACTIVITIES OF DAILY

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:27.640
LIVING LIKE BAITING AND

00:08:27.707 --> 00:08:29.041
TOILETING DRESSING EATING AND

00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:29.575
MORE.

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:30.977
HELP WITH MEDICATION MANAGEMENT

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:32.445
AND HEALTH MONITORING.

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:33.512
THE HELP WITH MEDICAL CARE THEY

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:34.847
ADVOCATE WITH DOCTORS AND

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:36.949
HOSPITALS AND THEY DO THIS ALL

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.084
TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.418
SO THEY CAN STAY AT HOME IN THE

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:40.419
COMMUNITY.

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:42.388
THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:45.458
THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE OR AS THEY

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:46.859
HAVE MORE COMPLEX NEEDS.

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:48.494
BUT IT'S ALSO GOOD POLICY FAMILY

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:50.096
CAREGIVERS HELP KEEP PEOPLE AT

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:52.765
HOME WHICH SAVES THE STATE MONEY.

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.367
BECAUSE IT'S MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:56.569
TO CARE FOR PEOPLE AT HOME THAN

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:58.371
AND MORE COSTLY INSTITUTIONS.

00:08:58.437 --> 00:08:59.505
BUT FAMILY CAREGIVERS DO ALL

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:01.974
THIS AT TREMENDOUS COST MENTAL

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.876
COST EMOTIONAL COSTS PHYSICAL

00:09:03.943 --> 00:09:05.278
COST AND ECONOMIC COST TO

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:06.412
THEMSELVES.

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:08.314
AND THEIR FAMILIES AND TO OUR

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.348
KEEP OUR ECONOMY.

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:10.583
THEY MISS OUT ON WAGES THEY

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.752
SPEND MONEY OUT OF THEIR OWN

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.320
POCKET TO PROVIDE THIS CARE.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.022
AND ECONOMIC COSTS FEEDING

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:17.390
INTERGENERATIONAL CYCLE OF

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:18.858
ECONOMIC AND SECURITY AND

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:21.928
POVERTY IN MANY FAMILIES AND

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:23.562
COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE.

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:24.797
SO THAT BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:25.765
CRITICAL POINT.

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:26.866
WALK CARE GIVING IMPACTS ALL OF

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:29.702
US IT IMPACTS SOME OF US MORE.

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:30.836
THE PROCESS OF CARING FOR A

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:32.038
FAMILY MEMBER IS AN EXTREME

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:33.205
CHALLENGE EVEN FOR THE

00:09:33.272 --> 00:09:34.774
WEALTHIEST FAMILIES.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.841
AND IT'S EVEN MORE OF A

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.109
CHALLENGE THAT'S COMPOUNDED BY

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:39.378
ECONOMIC AND SECURITY FOR LOW

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:39.912
INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:40.913
FAMILIES.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.081
IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:43.716
HIGHEST RATE OF SENIOR POVERTY

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:46.252
IN THE COUNTRY. ONE IN FIVE

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:47.286
SENIORS IN CALIFORNIA'S LIVES IN

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:49.021
POVERTY.

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:50.589
AND EVEN MORE ARE JUST ABOVE THE

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:51.657
POVERTY LEVEL.

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:53.192
STRUGGLING TO JUST MEET BASIC

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:55.761
NEEDS LIKE HOUSING AND FOOD AND

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:56.996
TRANSPORTATION.

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:59.031
SO IMAGINE GOING THROUGH THE

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.566
DIFFICULTY OF PROVIDING --

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:01.500
IN CARING FOR A FAMILY MEMBER

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:04.570
WITH A LONG TERM IF YOU ALSO ARE

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:05.571
WORRIED ABOUT HOW YOU WILL PAY

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:07.473
THE RENT OR HOW HE WILL AFFORD

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.209
FOOD THAT MONTH. ONE FAMILY STEP

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.544
IN TO HELP.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.379
WITH THE ECONOMICALLY AND SECURE

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:14.981
OLDER ADULTS THAT JUST DEPLETES

00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:16.315
THE INCOME AND ASSETS THAT ARE

00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:17.917
AVAILABLE TO THE WHOLE FAMILY.

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:19.652
AND INCREASES THE CHANCES THAT

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:21.187
THE NEXT GENERATION THAT FAMILY

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:22.888
AND THE ONE AFTER THAT WILL ALSO

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.890
AGENT THE POVERTY.

00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:26.225
IT'S IMPORTANT OUT THAT ANOTHER

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.060
POPULATION THAT'S PARTICULARLY

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:29.729
IMPACTED BY CARE GIVING IS WOMEN.

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:32.999
WOMEN PROVIDE 60% OF A FAMILY

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:34.266
CARE GIVING SERVICES IN THE

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:35.668
STATE IN THE COUNTRY ACTUALLY

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:37.670
AND WOMEN AVERAGE THIRTEEN YEARS

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:38.971
OF NO EARNINGS.

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:40.606
DUE TO CAREGIVING

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:41.741
RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:43.409
THE RESULT IS THAT WOMEN ARE

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.045
MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY AS MEN

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:47.646
TO AGE INTO POVERTY.

00:10:47.713 --> 00:10:48.748
ANOTHER GROUP PARTICULARLY

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.549
IMPACTED BY FAMILY CARE GIVING

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:51.817
ARE BLACK AND LATINO X. FAMILIES.

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:53.552
WERE CARE GIVER SPEND AS MUCH AS

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:56.055
40% OF THEIR INCOME ON CARE

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:57.490
GIVING EXPENSES.

00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:59.258
AS WITH WOMEN THE ECONOMIC COSTS

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.292
OF CARE GIVING FOR THIS GROUP

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:02.495
CONTRIBUTE TO HIGHER RATES OF

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:04.597
POVERTY AS THEY AGE.

00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:06.232
SO MY THIRD AND FINAL POINT WE

00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:07.767
AS A STATE CAN AND MUST TAKE

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.268
BOLD ACTION TO BETTER SUPPORT

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.570
CALIFORNIA'S FAMILY CARE GIVERS

00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:12.004
AN OLDER ADULTS WITH

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:12.905
DISABILITIES.

00:11:12.972 --> 00:11:14.373
THAT THEY CARE.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.141
FOR CALIFORNIA HAS SEVERAL

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:16.542
PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:17.510
ASSIST IN SUPPORT FAMILY

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:19.011
CAREGIVERS BUT MANY OF THESE

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:19.745
PROGRAMS.

00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:21.580
HAVE NOT BEEN EXPANDED TO KEEP

00:11:21.647 --> 00:11:22.815
PACE WITH GROWING NEEDS AND IN

00:11:22.882 --> 00:11:24.450
SOME CASES THEY'VE ACTUALLY BEEN

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:25.484
CUT BACK.

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:27.086
SO NOW IS THE TIME TO IMPROVE

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:28.454
AND EXPAND THESE PROGRAMS

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.322
INCLUDING EYEQ ASSESS THE

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:32.191
COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE.

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:33.692
COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:37.029
THE EMPHASIS P. PRO IS THE

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:38.764
EIGHTY ARE SEIZE LEGAL SERVICES

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:40.099
AND MORE.

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.534
AND AS WE SEEK TO BETTER SUPPORT

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.069
FAMILY CAREGIVERS WE NEED TO GO

00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:44.070
ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE'RE

00:11:44.136 --> 00:11:45.337
DOING TO TODAY WE NEED TO THINK

00:11:45.404 --> 00:11:47.006
BOLDLY AND TAKE ACTION TO CREATE

00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:48.841
A MASTER PLAN FOR AGING HAS BEEN

00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:50.176
CALLED AS HAS BEEN CALLED FOR BY

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:51.677
THE GOVERNOR.

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:53.345
AND BY OTHERS IN THIS BODY.

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:54.613
AT PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE SUPPORT

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.115
FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS AND ALSO

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:57.149
IN OCCURRED INTERCONNECTED

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:58.551
ISSUES LIKE ELDER ECONOMIC

00:11:58.617 --> 00:12:00.219
SECURITY.

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:00.686
HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:03.556
AFFORDABILITY ORAL HEALTH CARE I

00:12:03.622 --> 00:12:05.124
JUST SETS IMPROVEMENTS ELDER

00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:07.359
ABUSE THE PAGER CARE GIVER WORK

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:08.561
FOR SOME MORE.

00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:09.595
THE PLAN TO PLACE IT CENTER

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:11.397
ISSUES OF EQUITY HOW CAN WE

00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:12.665
DESIGN OUR SYSTEMS TO ADDRESS

00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:14.166
SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES.

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:15.468
THAT RESULT IN DRASTICALLY

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:16.569
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.270
OUTCOMES AMONG OLDER PEOPLE AS

00:12:18.337 --> 00:12:19.438
THEY AGE.

OF THE DATA BUT I DO WANT TO

00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:10.583
FREE MY REMARKS WITH.

BECAUSE IT REALLY PROVIDES THE

00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:18.557
CONTEXT.

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:20.659
IN PART WHY WE MUST RELY ON

00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:22.261
FAMILY CARE GIVERS TO PROVIDE

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:23.929
CARE FOR BOTH OUR AGING AND

00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:25.798
DISABLED FAMILY MEMBERS.

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:28.934
BUT IT ALSO REALLY TELLS US THE

00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:32.071
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER CHOICE.

00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:34.039
AS KEVIN NOTED MEDICARE PROVIDES

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:35.941
LIMITED BENEFITS A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:37.209

TO SPEND DOWN TO QUALIFY FOR

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:41.614
MEDI CAL.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.115
THE SIMPLE FACT IS AN THIS IS

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:44.416
ACCORDING TO A OR ANY OTHER

00:14:44.483 --> 00:14:46.418
PEOPLE REPORT THAT WAS JUST

00:14:46.485 --> 00:14:49.054
PUBLISHED LAST YEAR.

00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:50.289
L. TSS COST MORE THAN MOST

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:51.190
CALIFORNIANS.

00:14:51.257 --> 00:14:52.324
CAN AFFORD.

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:54.526
THE AVERAGE OLDER CALIFORNIAN

00:14:54.593 --> 00:14:57.162
HOUSEHOLDS HAS A MEDIAN INCOME

00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:58.664
OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:01.267
AND ONE IN THREE ACTUALLY 36% OF

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:04.470
OLDER CALIFORNIANS OVER.

00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:06.405
SIXTY FIVE LIVED BELOW 210050%

00:15:06.472 --> 00:15:09.174
OF THE POVERTY LEVEL IN.

00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:10.709
TWENTY SIXTEEN AT THE SAME TIME.

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:14.480
MOST FOLKS REQUIRED OR WOULD

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:16.482
NEED TO SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF

00:15:16.548 --> 00:15:19.184
HIGH COSTS SUCH AS A HUNDRED AND

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:20.619
SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:22.454
FOR A PRIVATE NURSING HOME ROOM

00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:25.491
IN A NURSING FACILITY AND NINETY

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:27.926
SEVEN THOUSAND FOR A SHARED ROOM.

00:15:27.993 --> 00:15:29.928
EVEN LOOKING AT SAY ASSISTANT

00:15:29.995 --> 00:15:31.330
ASSISTED LIVING THAT BASE COST

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:32.498
IS FIFTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:33.799
YEAR THAT'S THE SAME AS THE

00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:35.601
MEDIAN INCOME --

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:37.636
EVEN IF HOME HEALTH CARE THIRTY

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:39.471
HOURS A WEEK.

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:42.741
IS ACCORDING TO A A RP ESTIMATES

00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:43.342
THIRTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:44.910
YEAR.

00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:46.178
AT THE SAME TIME I KNOW

00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:47.613
SOMETIMES I HEAR FOLKS SAY WHAT

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.847
ABOUT LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE I

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:50.349
THINK MOST MEMBERS OF THIS

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:51.317
COMMITTEE NOW.

00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:53.118
LESS THAN 5% OF CALIFORNIANS

00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:55.187
HAVE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE IS

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:56.889
NOT A VIABLE OPTION.

00:15:56.955 --> 00:15:59.625
THAT MEANS THAT CAL OLDER.

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:01.860
OLDER AND DISABLED CALIFORNIANS

00:16:01.927 --> 00:16:03.562
HAVE TO RELY ON A FAMILY CARE

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:05.664
GIVER IF THEY HAVE. ONE TO HELP

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:06.565
THEM WHEN THEY ARE NEEDED IN

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.133
NEED OF ASSISTANCE AND OF COURSE

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.369
FEW CAN AFFORD TO PAY TO PRIVATE

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:12.237
PAY FOR KIM.

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:14.907
WE THEN PUT THIS BALL GO FAMILY

00:16:14.973 --> 00:16:16.642
CARE GIVING ON THESE FAMILY CARE

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:19.678
GIVERS MOST OF WHOM WORK --

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:22.014
AND IS KEVIN NOTED ESTIMATES ARE

00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:23.749
NEARLY FOUR AND A HALF MILLION

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:26.919
CALIFORNIANS OR FAMILY

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:29.221
CAREGIVERS.

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:31.824
SO YES MANY FAMILIES DO THIS OUT

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.025
OF LOVE AND DUTY.

00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:34.326
AND THEY DO THIS IS ALSO BECAUSE

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:35.594
THEY BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT WE'VE

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.029
ALWAYS DONE.

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:40.199
IT SAYS HOW ON A SHOW RESPECT

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:42.134
AND HOW I PAY MY PARENTS BACK

00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:43.602
FOR HOW THEY HELP ME BUT THAT'S

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:46.739
A TREMENDOUS BURDEN. TO CARRY

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:48.307
WHEN YOU WERE IN THE AVERAGE

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:49.775
FAMILY CARE GIVER WAS FORTY NINE

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.111
YEARS OLD WORKING THIRTY FIVE

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:53.312
HOURS A WEEK.

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:55.647
IN ADDITION IT'S NOT JUST THE

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:57.216
FACT THAT FOLKS ARE WORKING BUT

00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:59.451
OUR RESEARCH FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:00.519
FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE FAMILY

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:01.687
CARE GIVER FOR AN OLDER

00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:02.521
INDIVIDUAL.

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:06.024
SPENDS NEARLY SEVENTH A POCKET

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:06.992
EVERY YEAR.

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:08.727
AND FOR SOMEBODY CARING FOR AN

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:09.995
INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT SUMMERS AND

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:12.131
OTHER DEMENTIAS IT'S OVER TEN

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:14.133
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:15.868
A RESEARCH ALSO FOUND THAT

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:17.269
LETTING NECKS.

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:19.905
CARE GIVERS SPEND OVER NINE

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:22.274
THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU.

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:23.876
IN ADDITION OUT OLDER STUDY FROM

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:25.944
MET LIFE FROM EARLIER THIS

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:28.247
DECADE FOUND THAT THE LOST WAGES

00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:29.648
FOR YOUR TYPICAL CARE GIVER.

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.217
WAS OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:32.918
DOLLARS A THAT DOESN'T EVEN

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:34.586
COUNT SAY THE LOS SOCIAL

00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:36.088
SECURITY BENEFITS.

00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:37.623
WE KNOW THAT CARE GIVERS HAVE

00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:39.525
REPORTED EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL AND

00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:43.462
HEALTH RELATED STRAIN AS WELL.

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:45.464
WE ARE PUTTING A TREMENDOUS

00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:46.498
AMOUNT OF BURDEN ON OUR CARE

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:49.368
GIVERS ASKING TO AWFUL I ASKING

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:50.836
WAR IMPLYING THAT THEY SHOULD BE

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.571
THE PRIMARY SUPPORTER FOR AN

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:53.872
AILING FAMILY MEMBER.

00:17:53.939 --> 00:17:56.041
BUT MOST ARE GETTING VERY LITTLE

00:17:56.108 --> 00:17:57.810
SUPPORT --

00:17:57.876 --> 00:17:58.911
FOR EXAMPLE OR CAN GIVE A

00:17:58.977 --> 00:18:00.779
RESOURCE CENTERS.

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:03.315
WHICH IS ONE OF THE FEW STATE

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:05.217
SOLELY STATE BASED PROGRAMS THAT

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:06.718
HELP FAMILY CARE GIVERS.

00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:09.154
THOUGHT CUTS OF OVER 75% BACK

00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:11.223
DURING THE RECESSION IN THE

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.460
MONEY HAS NOT BEEN RESTORED.

00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:15.928
HE BELIEVES WE CAN KEEP DOING

00:18:15.994 --> 00:18:17.095
THINGS THE SAME WAY.

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:18.397
NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THESE HIGH

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:19.832
COSTS BUT BECAUSE WE ARE

00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:20.732
APPROACHING THE POINT WHERE

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:22.100
THERE WILL BE AS MANY PEOPLE

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:24.336
OVER SIXTEEN AS UNDER NINETEEN

00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:28.574
THAT COMES UP IN. SIX YEARS.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.343
END AN EARLIER STUDY BY A. R. P.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.744
ALSO FOUND.

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:35.147
THAT A RATIO OF PAID AND UNPAID

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:36.748
OR INFORMAL CARE GIVERS WENT

00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:37.950
WELL DECLINE PRECIPITOUSLY IT

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:41.320
WAS ABOUT SEVEN TO ONE IN.

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:42.454
TWENTY TEN BEFORE TO ONE IN.

00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:43.222
TWENTY THIRTY AND THREE TO ONE

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:45.824
BY.

00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:46.758
TWENTY FIFTY SOME OF THIS COULD

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:48.393
BE BECAUSE FOLKS ARE HAVING

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.363
SMALLER FAMILIES WE ALSO KNOW

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.699
FROM SOME OF OUR OWN DATA THAT

00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:55.767
27% OF OLDER ADULTS ARE ACTUALLY

ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR HOUSEHOLDS

00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:01.492
HAVE FAMILY CARE GIVERS AND WILK

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:03.027
CERTAINLY WE ARE NOT REACHING

00:31:03.094 --> 00:31:04.462
THAT WERE PROBABLY REACHING MORE

00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:06.497
LIKE 122%.

00:31:06.564 --> 00:31:09.167
OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS WE YOU KNOW

00:31:09.234 --> 00:31:11.069
WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT THE NEED TO

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:12.737
ADDRESS DIVERSITY.

00:31:12.804 --> 00:31:15.006
AND WHEN DEVELOPING POLICIES AND

00:31:15.073 --> 00:31:16.708
PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:31:16.774 --> 00:31:18.943
IN GENERAL WHEN PEOPLE THINK OF

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.446
DIVERSITY THIS DISCUSSION TENDS

00:31:21.512 --> 00:31:24.382
TO FOCUS ON RACE AND ETHNICITY.

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:26.251
TODAY WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS

00:31:26.317 --> 00:31:28.620
KIND OF EXPAND YOUR DEFINITION.

00:31:28.686 --> 00:31:30.388
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FAMILY

00:31:30.455 --> 00:31:31.889
CARE GIVING?

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:33.424
BECAUSE WINDOWS DIVRSITY WHAT

00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:34.659
WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE WHEN WE

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:37.061
APPLY IT TO FAMILY CARE GIVERS

00:31:37.128 --> 00:31:38.796
AND IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH

00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:40.231
BROADER IN SCOPE.

00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:42.567
WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT FAMILY

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:45.169
CARE GIVING AND DIVERSITY? FOR

00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:47.171
THIS POPULATION WE HAVE TO BE --

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:48.039
REALLY HAVE A BETTER

00:31:48.106 --> 00:31:51.376
UNDERSTANDING OF DIVERSITY WHICH

00:31:51.442 --> 00:31:52.910
INCLUDES NOT JUST RACE AND

00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:53.845
ETHNICITY.

00:31:53.911 --> 00:31:57.382
BUT ALSO PREFERENCES SUCH AS

00:31:57.448 --> 00:31:59.150
CULTURAL PREFERENCES FOR FAMILY

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:00.351
CARE GIVERS AND HOW THEY WANT TO

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:02.420
BE.

00:32:02.487 --> 00:32:04.022
PRESENTED WITH SERVICES WHERE

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:07.058
THEY WANT TO ACCESS SERVICES AND

00:32:07.125 --> 00:32:07.558
WHEN THEY WANT TO ACCESS

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:09.093
SERVICES.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.928
THERE CERTAINLY IS DIVERSITY

00:32:10.995 --> 00:32:11.462
BROKE --

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:13.798
AMONG H..

00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:15.867
CARE GIVERS RANGE FROM A FOR OUR

00:32:15.933 --> 00:32:18.002
GROUP EIGHTEEN AND UP.

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:20.471
AND WE SEE DIFFERENT GENERATIONS.

00:32:20.538 --> 00:32:21.639
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:32:21.706 --> 00:32:23.274
PEOPLE TEND TO EAT FOR AND

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:24.575
THEY'RE ALL CARING FOR OLDER

00:32:24.642 --> 00:32:25.777
ADULTS.

00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:27.578
BUT IF YOU HAVE A THIRTY SIX

00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:30.848
YEAR OLD THE WORKING.

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:32.417
AND CARING FOR THEIR FAMILY

00:32:32.483 --> 00:32:34.085
MEMBER THEIR NEEDS ARE GOING TO

00:32:34.152 --> 00:32:36.354
BE DIFFERENT THAN THE EIGHTY SIX

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:37.689
YEAR OLD WHO'S CARING FOR THEIR

00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:39.190
SPOUSE.

00:32:39.257 --> 00:32:40.291
BUT HOW DO WE GO ABOUT

00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:42.026
UNDERSTANDING WHY HOW THEIR

00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:43.261
SIMILAR.

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:44.829
AND SO ONE OF THE FIRST GAPS I

00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:47.265
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS A NEED FOR

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:49.033
ACE OF GOOD STANDARDIZED

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.202
ASSESSMENT TOOL.

00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:53.271
WHAT WE DON'T HAVE --

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:55.440
CONSISTENTLY EXCEPT TO LOOK ONE

00:32:55.506 --> 00:32:57.175
A COUPLE OF SYSTEMS IS A

00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:58.409
STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT TOOL

00:32:58.476 --> 00:33:00.078
THAT IT DOES A COMPREHENSIVE

00:33:00.144 --> 00:33:02.413
ASSESSMENT FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.982
WE NEED TO HAVE A SIMILAR LEVEL

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:06.918
OF LIKE THE MINIMUM DATA SET OF

00:33:06.984 --> 00:33:08.553
INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER

00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:09.854
SYSTEMS.

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:11.556
SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:14.459
A PERSON'S EMPLOYMENT STATUS --

00:33:14.525 --> 00:33:17.028
HOW DOES GENDER GENDER IDENTITY

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:18.996
IMPACT THEIR FAMILY CARE GIVING

00:33:19.063 --> 00:33:20.398
OUT IS INCOME IMPACT FAMILY CARE

00:33:20.465 --> 00:33:21.332
GIVING?

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:23.368
WHAT'S THE CARE RECIPIENTS AND

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:27.872
THE CARE RECEIVERS HEALTH STATUS.

00:33:27.939 --> 00:33:31.275
WE'RE OFTEN ASK IS CARE GIVERS

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:32.043
TO ALL COULD YOU COULD GO HOME

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.077
TAKE CARE OF YOUR HUSBAND BUT

00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:34.379
HAS ANYONE ASKED THE CARE GIVER

00:33:34.445 --> 00:33:36.614
ABOUT THEIR BACK PROBLEMS.

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:37.482
THEIR SLEEPING HABITS.

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:39.450
THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:41.552
WE NEED MENTAL AND PHYSICAL

00:33:41.619 --> 00:33:42.820
CONCERNS OF THE CARE GIVER

00:33:42.887 --> 00:33:45.356
WHAT'S THEIR MENTAL HEALTH LIKE

00:33:45.423 --> 00:33:46.724
AND WHAT KIND OF SOCIAL SUPPORT

00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:48.092
DO THEY HAVE.

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:49.293
WHEN THEY START THEIR CARE

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.261
GIVING JOURNEY?

00:33:50.328 --> 00:33:51.929
BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE QUITE

00:33:51.996 --> 00:33:52.997
A LOT OF THE TIME THAT THEY WILL

00:33:53.064 --> 00:33:54.866
BE PROVIDING CARE ON AVERAGE

00:33:54.932 --> 00:33:56.667
ABOUT FOUR YEARS.

00:33:56.734 --> 00:33:58.102
WE NEED A SYSTEM.

00:33:58.169 --> 00:34:00.772
THROUGH THIS ASSESSMENT THAT HAS

00:34:00.838 --> 00:34:02.340
THAT FLEXIBILITY SO THAT.

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:04.409
GET A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT'S

00:34:04.475 --> 00:34:06.577
THE SAME BUT THEN THAT ALLOWS

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:09.747
YOU TO INDIVIDUALIZE YOUR CARE

00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:12.283
AND TREATMENT PLANNING FOR THE

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:13.985
FAMILY CAREGIVER SO THE A ONE

00:34:14.051 --> 00:34:15.686
BIG GAP IS HAVING.

00:34:15.753 --> 00:34:17.855
CONSISTENT INFORMATION FROM OUR

00:34:17.922 --> 00:34:20.191
CARE GIVERS THAT ACROSS ALL OF

00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:21.659
OUR SYSTEMS.

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:23.628
THE OTHER THING WE WANT TO LOOK

00:34:23.694 --> 00:34:25.496
AT I WITH THE SECOND THING IS

00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:27.732
THE NEXT GAP IS FOR FAMILY CARE

00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:31.736
GIVERS IS TO WAY OF IMPROVING

00:34:31.803 --> 00:34:33.137
CARE GIVER STRESS.

00:34:33.204 --> 00:34:35.907
THROUGH EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS.

00:34:35.973 --> 00:34:38.009
NOW THERE OF SOME EVIDENCE BASED

00:34:38.075 --> 00:34:39.911
PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE.

00:34:39.977 --> 00:34:40.978
THAT ARE FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS

00:34:41.045 --> 00:34:42.780
BUT WHAT WE FIND IS WHEN IT

00:34:42.847 --> 00:34:44.182
COMES TO THE COMMUNITY LEVEL

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:46.584
THESE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:49.520
TESTED IN IDEAL SITUATIONS.

00:34:49.587 --> 00:34:51.522
MAY NOT TRANSLATE INTO THE

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:54.258
COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY MAY.

00:34:54.325 --> 00:34:55.860
REQUIRE OF THE MAY ONLY BE IN

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:57.295
ENGLISH.

00:34:57.361 --> 00:35:00.398
IT MAY REQUIRE SIX OR SEVEN

00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:02.733
TIMES TO COME TO THE PROGRAM BUT

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.602
WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THEM TO

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:06.871
TAKE A BREAK AND BE AT HOME AND

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:07.905
WHERE'S THE RESPITE CARE FOR

00:35:07.972 --> 00:35:08.739
THAT --

00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:11.175
MAYBE AND SOMETIMES THE FUNDING

00:35:11.242 --> 00:35:14.011
DOESN'T ALLOW FOR IT THE A

00:35:14.078 --> 00:35:15.580
AGENCIES TO ACTUALLY BE

00:35:15.646 --> 00:35:17.215
REIMBURSED BECAUSE YOU NEED TO

00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:19.550
TRAINERS.

00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:20.551
AND THEY'RE SAYING WELL WE'RE

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:22.487
ONLY GONNA PAY FOR ONE PERSON TO

00:35:22.553 --> 00:35:23.654
DO THE TRAINNG BUT THE MODEL

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:25.690
THE EVIDENCE BASED.

00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:28.059
THAT HAS LINKED TO OUTCOMES.

00:35:28.125 --> 00:35:30.761
REQUIRES TWO TRAINERS AT THE

00:35:30.828 --> 00:35:31.329
SAME TIME IN THE CITY --

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:32.396
NO WE'RE ONLY GOING TO GIVE YOU

00:35:32.463 --> 00:35:34.765
TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO DO THIS

00:35:34.832 --> 00:35:34.999
PROGRAM.

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:36.501
THAT'S IT.

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:38.236
WOULDN'T THAT IS A MAJOR GAP AND

00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:39.704
WE NEED TO HAVE POLICIES THAT

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:40.505
ALLOW FOR THAT TYPE OF

00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:43.474
FLEXIBILITY --

00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:45.142
THE OTHER THE THIRD THING I WANT

00:35:45.209 --> 00:35:47.345
YOU TO THINK AROUND GAPS IS I

00:35:47.411 --> 00:35:48.312
MENTIONED EMPLOYMENT AS A TYPE

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:49.914
OF DIVERSITY FOR FAMILY

00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:50.615
CAREGIVERS.

00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:52.250
AND GET AS YOU HEARD BEFORE WE

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:54.685
HAVE ABOUT 60% OF CARE GIVERS

00:35:54.752 --> 00:35:56.220
WHO WERE IN THE WORKPLACE.

00:35:56.287 --> 00:35:57.855
BUT WHAT WE DON'T HAVE A

00:35:57.922 --> 00:36:00.691
CONSISTENT POLICIES THAT --

00:36:00.758 --> 00:36:01.459
ARE.

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:04.428
HELP PROTECT FAMILY CARE GIVERS

00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:06.864
WE HEAR STORIES OF CARE GIVERS

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:10.468
WHO KNOW THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:11.836
TO MAYBE TAKE OFF MORE TIME

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:13.638
THERE'S AND JOB PROTECTION.

00:36:13.704 --> 00:36:14.872
AND THEY ALSO SOMETIMES FEEL

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:16.607
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ONE

00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:17.675
SOMEBODY HEARS THAT THEY ARE

00:36:17.742 --> 00:36:20.144
FAMILY CARE GIVER SO THEY DON'T

00:36:20.211 --> 00:36:21.212
TALK ABOUT THEIR CARE GIVING --

00:36:21.279 --> 00:36:23.047
AND WE KNOW THE CARE GIVERS ARE

00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:24.482
READY DON'T SELF IDENTIFIED BUT

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:25.750
NOW THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:27.418
CAN EVEN MENTION IT TO AN

00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:28.085
EMPLOYER.

00:36:28.152 --> 00:36:29.620
BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT HAVE ANY

00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:31.022
TYPE OF PROTECTION.

00:36:31.088 --> 00:36:33.357
AND AT THE SAME TIME AS FAR AS

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:35.126
EMPLOYMENT.

00:36:35.192 --> 00:36:36.460
OUR CARE GIVERS NEED TO HAVE

00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:37.628
SOME FLEXIBILITY SO THAT.

00:36:37.695 --> 00:36:39.430
DEPENDING ON WHEN YOU'RE WORKING

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:41.632
THE SUPPORT SERVICES NEED TO BE

00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:43.568
ABLE TO BE ONLINE AND PROVIDE

00:36:43.634 --> 00:36:44.902
SOME OF THE TRAINING AND

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:46.137
EDUCATION.

00:36:46.203 --> 00:36:47.972
THAT FILTERED INDIVIDUALLY THAT

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:48.906
COMES OUT OF THAT GREAT

00:36:48.973 --> 00:36:50.741
ASSESSMENT THAT YOU MAY HAVE --

00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:52.276
THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE THAT

00:36:52.343 --> 00:36:54.445
INDIVIDUAL TIME WHEN THEY CAN DO

00:36:54.512 --> 00:36:55.813
IT WHICH MIGHT BE IT TEN AT

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:56.380
NIGHT.

00:36:56.447 --> 00:36:57.682
MIGHT BE EIGHT IN THE MORNING

00:36:57.748 --> 00:37:01.052
BUT NOT THE NORM NOT THE NINE TO

00:37:01.118 --> 00:37:03.120
FIVE FINALLY WE KNOW THE CARE

00:37:03.187 --> 00:37:04.121
GIVING IS A JOURNEY.

00:37:04.188 --> 00:37:06.757
AND BECAUSE OF THIS WE REALLY.

00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:09.894
IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE SUPPORT.

00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:12.396
FROM TIME FOR RESPITE FOR FAMILY

00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:13.331
CAREGIVERS.

00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:16.367
THERE IS A CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF

00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:18.769
FUNDING FOR RESPITE.

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:20.104
THERE WE CERTAINLY HAVE RESTED

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:22.006
COMING IN THROUGH SOME OF THE

00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:24.241
THREE E. PROGRAMS BUT IT'S YES

00:37:24.308 --> 00:37:25.576
IT IS NOT ENOUGH THE LIST ARE

00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:27.612
EXTREMELY LONG. FOR CARE GIVERS

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:28.245
WHO NEED A BREAK IF YOU COULD A

00:37:28.312 --> 00:37:33.851
MATCH YOUR LIFE GOING.

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:34.819
FOR THREE FOUR OR MORE YEARS

00:37:34.885 --> 00:37:37.588
WITHOUT EVER HAVING A VACATION.

00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:40.024
WITHOUT EVER BEING ABLE TO TAKE

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:41.792
A DEEP BREATH ARE HAVE A GOOD

00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:43.894
NIGHT'S SLEEP.

00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:45.029
THAT'S ALL THEY'RE ASKING FOR

00:37:45.096 --> 00:37:46.864
THEY'RE NOT ASKING FOR A FULL

00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:48.232
TIME REPLACEMENT.

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:50.101
FAMILIES THEY WANT TO BE THERE

00:37:50.167 --> 00:37:51.268
FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBER.

00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:52.837
BUT YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE NICE TO

00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:55.272
BE ABLE TO GO AWAY FOR A COUPLE

00:37:55.339 --> 00:37:56.641
OF HOURS OR SLEEP.

00:37:56.707 --> 00:37:58.009
OVERNIGHT SOMETHING SOME TYPE OF

00:37:58.075 --> 00:37:59.577
RESPITE.

00:37:59.644 --> 00:38:01.846
SO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE

00:38:01.912 --> 00:38:03.781
THE ABILITY FOR FAMILY MEMBERS

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:04.982
AND THAT'S A BIG GAP.

00:38:05.049 --> 00:38:06.550
AT THE OTHER THING IS PULSE CARE

00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:08.085
GIVING.

00:38:08.152 --> 00:38:09.954
WE DON'T OFTEN THINK ABOUT WHAT

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:12.089
HAPPENS TO THE CARE GIVER AFTER

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:14.225
THE PERSON AT THE BEEN CARING

00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:16.127
FOR PASSES AWAY AND SO SOME OF

00:38:16.193 --> 00:38:18.863
OUR SYSTEMS MOST OF THE END.

00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:20.197
ON THE DAY THAT THE PERSON STOPS

00:38:20.264 --> 00:38:21.832
BEING A CARE GIVER BUT HOSPICE

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:23.801
HAS A GREAT MODEL WHERE AT LEAST

00:38:23.868 --> 00:38:25.536
YOU CAN.

00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:27.505
CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE FAMILY

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:28.572
MEMBERS.

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.374

00:38:38.849 --> 00:38:41.085
HAVE BECOME SO ISOLATED --

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:43.054

SHE DIDN'T WANT.

00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:12.977
TO TELL FRIENDS AND FAMILY --

00:40:13.043 --> 00:40:17.114
SHE WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING

00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:18.783
IN THE HOUSEHOLD BECAUSE AGAIN --

00:40:18.849 --> 00:40:20.184
MY FATHER PASSED AWAY THREE

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:21.552
WEEKS BEFORE THEIR FIFTIETH

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:23.220
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY SO.

00:40:23.287 --> 00:40:26.924
SHE WAS VERY PRIVATE AND MY DAD

00:40:26.991 --> 00:40:28.125
MY DAD WAS DIAGNOSED WITH

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:30.561
ALZHEIMER'S AT THE AGE OF SIXTY

00:40:30.628 --> 00:40:31.996
SEVEN AND HAD IT FOR SEVENTEEN

00:40:32.062 --> 00:40:32.663
YEARS.

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:35.466
SO MY MOTHER WAS HIS CARE GIVER

00:40:35.533 --> 00:40:37.134
FOR FOURTEEN YEARS --

00:40:37.201 --> 00:40:39.470
SHE SHE HE PASSED AWAY WHEN SHE

00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:40.905
WAS EIGHTY FIVE SHE IS TOLD SHE

00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:42.573
WAS TWO YEARS OLDER THAN HIM.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.575
SO ALL OF THE EFFORT THAT YOU

00:40:44.642 --> 00:40:45.776
PUT AND SHE WAS AN ACTUALLY

00:40:45.843 --> 00:40:49.480
OLDER WOMAN THAN THAN MY FATHER --

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:50.447
ABOUT FIVE YEARS INTO MY

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:52.683
FATHER'S DIAGNOSIS MY MOTHER DID

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.985
QUIT HER JOB AND BECAME AN

00:40:55.052 --> 00:40:56.554
UNPAID FULL TIME CARE GIVER --

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.255
WHICH MEANT THAT AGAIN MY FOR MY

00:40:58.322 --> 00:40:59.523
MOTHER WAS A CARE GIVER ALL

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:01.292
THROUGH ER SEVENTIES AND INTO

00:41:01.358 --> 00:41:05.863
THAT FIRST HALF OF HER EIGHTIES --

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.465
AND AS MUCH AS MY FATHER'S CARE.

00:41:08.532 --> 00:41:09.767
AGREE MORE BURDENSOME AND

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:11.168
DEMANDING MY MOTHER AGAIN

00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:12.903
THOUGHT VERY RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.372
AND WOULD NOT GO OUTSIDE.

00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:18.175
THE HOME FOR ANY HELP --

00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:19.543
AS THE DISEASE PROGRESSED HE WAS

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:20.778
UNABLE TO DO MANY THINGS FOR

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:22.780
HIMSELF.

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:24.315
HE ALSO BEGAN TO HAVE VERY

00:41:24.381 --> 00:41:25.416
IRREGULAR SLEEPING PATTERN

00:41:25.482 --> 00:41:27.218
SOMEBODY'S LITERALLY BE UP FOR A

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:28.953
FEW MINUTES EVERY HOUR OF EVERY

00:41:29.019 --> 00:41:31.021
DAY AND SO THAT MEANT THAT MY

00:41:31.088 --> 00:41:32.623
MOTHER COULD NEVER HAVE TIME OUT

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:33.824
OF HER SIGHT.

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:37.728
SHE COULD NEVER LEAVE HIM ALONE --

00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:39.396
AND THANKFULLY SHE FOUND ADULT

00:41:39.463 --> 00:41:41.432
ADULT DAY SERVICES AND I BELIEVE

00:41:41.498 --> 00:41:43.067
THAT WITHOUT ADULT A SERVICES MY

00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:44.368
FATHER'S DISEASE WOULD HAVE

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:46.837
KILLED HER BECAUSE INITIALLY SHE

00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:48.072
TOOK HIM --

00:41:48.138 --> 00:41:50.574
AND TO THE DON'T THEY SERVICES

00:41:50.641 --> 00:41:52.409
FOR ABOUT FIVE HOURS EVERY

00:41:52.476 --> 00:41:54.511
COUPLE OF DAYS BUT BY THE END IT

00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:55.246
WAS.

00:41:55.312 --> 00:41:56.947
IT WAS A GOOD EIGHT HOURS FIVE

00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:58.716
DAYS A WEEK AND OFTEN MY MOM

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:00.584
WOULD JUST GO HOME AND SLEEP

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:02.086
SOMETIME SHOULD RUN ERRANDS.

00:42:02.152 --> 00:42:03.654
SHOULD EVEN GET CURVES AND

00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:06.357
SHOULD DO A LITTLE WORK OUT BY

00:42:06.423 --> 00:42:09.894
COMMENT TO SLEEP --

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.997
SHE SHE ULTIMATELY WHEN AN ON A

00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:13.597
NUMBER OF OCCASIONS WHERE SHE

00:42:13.664 --> 00:42:14.899
WAS IN SUCH BAD SHAPE THEY

00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:16.033
LITERALLY SAID WE'RE GOING TO

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.234
KEEP YOUR DAD FOR A WEEK BECAUSE

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:18.402
THEY COULD JUST LOOK AT HER AND

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:19.403
KNOW THAT SHE WAS.

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.639
SHE WAS SPENT SHE WAS GONE AND

00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:23.674
GETTING THE ISOLATION IS JUST.

00:42:23.741 --> 00:42:24.575
EXHAUSTING --

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:26.710
TO SO -- I

00:42:26.777 --> 00:42:27.845
LIVED IN LOS ANGELES DURING THIS

00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:29.346
TIME I CAME UP AS MUCH AS I

00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:30.814
COULD --

00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:32.716
AGAIN MOM NOT BEING WELL HONEST

00:42:32.783 --> 00:42:33.584
WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE

00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:35.352
HOUSEHOLD AS A FAMILY WE HAD

00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:36.754
DECIDED IN AGREED THAT AS SOON

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.690
AS MY FATHER'S HYGIENE WENT --

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:41.325
BUT HE WE WOULD LOOK AT

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:42.159
PERMANENT.

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:43.994
A NURSING HOME CARE FOR HIM MY

00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:45.829
MOM DID NOT TELL US THE TRUTH

00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:47.097
ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING FOR A

00:42:47.164 --> 00:42:49.566
GOOD TWO YEARS SO MY FATHER WAS

00:42:49.633 --> 00:42:50.601
HAVING MASSIVE TOILETING

00:42:50.668 --> 00:42:52.002
PROBLEMS.

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:53.570
FOR QUITE SOME TIME --

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:56.006
HE WAS HAVING EMOTIONAL OUTBURST --

00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:58.475
HE HE WASN'T A WALKER MEANING HE

00:42:58.542 --> 00:42:59.543
NEVER WALKED OUT THE FRONT DOOR

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.111
AND LEFT THE HOUSE BUT WE NEVER

00:43:01.178 --> 00:43:03.380
KNEW IF HE WAS GOING --

00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:05.149
TO SHE CARRIED ALL THESE BURDENS

00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:06.684
ON HER OWN --

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.786
AND AGAIN AS I SAID SHE WAS TWO

00:43:08.852 --> 00:43:13.557
YEARS OLDER THAN THAN HE WAS --

00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:14.124
SO MY DAD SPENT THE LAST TWO

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:17.461
YEARS OF HIS LIFE FOR RIFIC OF

00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:18.963
MY FATHER'S NURSING HOME STAY

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:20.431
WITH THAT WE COULD DO A WHOLE

00:43:20.497 --> 00:43:21.899
NOTHER -- A

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:23.734
HEARING ON THAT --

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:25.369
MY FATHER'S NURSING HOMES DAVIS

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:26.870
WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE WHICH

00:43:26.937 --> 00:43:28.839
ADDED EVEN MORE GUILT AND

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:30.574
PRESSURE ON TO MY MOTHER BECAUSE

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:32.343
AS MUCH AS YOU WANT TO MOVE N

00:43:32.409 --> 00:43:33.711
TO A NEW BETTER PLACE

00:43:33.777 --> 00:43:35.713
ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS ON MY TO BE

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:37.314
MOVED BUT THEN AGAIN ALSO.

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:38.615
SOMEBODY THESE PLACES ARE SO

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:40.818
SIMILAR AND THEIR LACK OF GOOD

00:43:40.884 --> 00:43:43.220
CARE -- ALSO

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:44.555
THIS CARE AND IT WAS HERE IN

00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:46.657
SACRAMENTO IN TWENTY ELEVEN WAS

00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:47.825
SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH.

00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:48.759
EVEN THOUGH MY MOTHER HAD

00:43:48.826 --> 00:43:50.894
PURCHASED SOME FORM OF LONG TERM

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.396
CARE INSURANCE DECADES BEFORE

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.498
NONE OF IT COVERED THIS --

00:43:54.565 --> 00:43:55.933
THE IN THE ADULT DAY SERVICES

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.402
CARE ALSO NOT COVERED --

00:43:58.469 --> 00:43:59.370
AND THIS WAS THE ONLY WAS MY

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:00.604
PARENTS WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:01.672

00:44:10.714 --> 00:44:12.449
BUT MY MY FAMIL WAS ABLE TO

00:44:12.516 --> 00:44:15.719
COVER IT BECAUSE OF THE PENSIONS.

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:17.855

CARING FOR FAMILY AND

00:47:21.038 --> 00:47:22.673
SPECIFICALLY MY GRANDMOTHER WHEN

00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:24.942
I WAS JUST A YOUNG GIRL BECAUSE

00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:26.643
SHE DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH.

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:28.812
BUT HER HEALTH WAS ALREADY NOT

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:30.614
WELL BUT SHE WOULDN'T LET

00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:32.082
ANYBODY KNOW.

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:35.552
AND AS I GOT OLDER WILL I'D LIKE

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:37.287
TO SHARE JUST A COUPLE OF TIMES

00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:40.057
THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP.

00:47:40.123 --> 00:47:43.860
MY IN LAWS --

00:47:43.927 --> 00:47:45.462
MY FATHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:47.264
CANCER IN THE IN THE EIGHTIES

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:48.665
WHEN WE LIVED HERE IN SACRAMENTO

00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:49.766
WERE ORIGINALLY FROM THE

00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:52.836
MODERATE AREA MY HUSBAND AND I

00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:54.204
SO OUR FAMILIES ARE THERE.

00:47:54.271 --> 00:47:55.639
SO --

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:56.907
LOCALLY I WORK IN A HEALTHCARE

00:47:56.974 --> 00:47:59.243
SYSTEM THAT WOULD HELP.

00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:01.278
GET MY IN LAWS ON THEIR HIVE

00:48:01.345 --> 00:48:02.446
PLAN.

00:48:02.512 --> 00:48:06.049
AND DURING HIS ILLNESS ON MY

00:48:06.116 --> 00:48:07.918
MOTHER LOVE BUT FORGET TO PAY

00:48:07.985 --> 00:48:09.553
THE PAY PREMIUMS SO WE WOULD

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.054
COVER THE PREMIUMS.

00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:13.857
COPAYS FOR THE PHARMACEUTICALS

00:48:13.924 --> 00:48:15.259
THAT WOULD NEED WERE NEEDED.

00:48:15.325 --> 00:48:20.163
ON MY HEAD HUSBAND HAD IS OFF

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:21.365
ALL AND HE CLOSED IT SO HE COULD

00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:23.000
WORK OUT OF THE HOUSE.

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:24.234
SO THEY COULD STAY THERE DURING

00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:25.736
THE DAY WHILE I'VE WORKED FULL

00:48:25.802 --> 00:48:27.571
TIME -- AND

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:28.972
IT WASN'T A FAMILY FRIENDLY

00:48:29.039 --> 00:48:31.608
ENVIRONMENT THERE WAS NO.

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:35.178
FMLA OR ANYTHING --

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:37.047
I HAD KIDS THAT WERE IN SCHOOLS

00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:38.081
SO.

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:40.517
I WORKED FULL TIME.

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:42.819
I DIDN'T SHARE A LOT AT WORK.

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:45.889
AND CAME HOME AND PREPARED MEALS

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:48.025
FOR FOR THE FOR ALL OF US.

00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:49.326
IN NATURE MY OUR KIDS GO TO

00:48:49.393 --> 00:48:51.028
SCHOOL --

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.529
SOMETIMES IF MY MOTHER IN LAW

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:55.198
HAD A ISSUE WITH MY FATHER Là

00:48:55.265 --> 00:48:56.800
SHE WOULD LIKE THE AND SEE WHAT

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:58.368
I COULD DO.

00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:00.671
AND AND MY HUSBAND TO I'M NOT

00:49:00.737 --> 00:49:02.139
GONNA SAY IT WAS ON ME BECAUSE I

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:02.739
WAS MORE OF A BACK UP.

00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:05.809
ON AND THEN YOU KNOW MAKING SURE

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:07.177
OUR KIDS MARKET I OUR DAUGHTER

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:08.645
WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:09.546
HE WAS.

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:11.415
ACTUALLY TERMINAL AND AND

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:12.416
HOSPICE.

00:49:12.482 --> 00:49:14.084
AND SO THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:15.852
YOUR FINE YEAR BUT IT WAS.

00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:16.920
THERE WAS --

00:49:16.987 --> 00:49:18.422
HE PASSED AWAY RIGHT BEFORE HER

00:49:18.488 --> 00:49:20.757
GRADUATION BUT WE MADE THE BEST

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:22.726
OF IT AND TRY TO KEEP OUR SON

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:23.894
BUSY -- TO

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.164
SO WE WERE REALLY DO WHAT IT WAS

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:29.800
LIKE OF OUR CULTURE DOESN'T PUT

00:49:29.866 --> 00:49:32.369
OUR FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND HOMES.

00:49:32.436 --> 00:49:33.837
I WOULDN'T HAVE A CLUE UNTIL

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:36.073
LATELY ASKING PEOPLE HOW MUCH IT

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:38.375
COSTS AND HOW IT WAS.

00:49:38.442 --> 00:49:39.810
MORE I WAS SHOCKED.

00:49:39.876 --> 00:49:41.445
BECAUSE WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN

00:49:41.511 --> 00:49:43.080
THAT'S A WE WERE RATIONING

00:49:43.146 --> 00:49:43.714
GRANDMOTHER TOOK CARE OF ALL OF

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.382
US.

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:47.317
AND SO IN THE RECENT YEARS --

00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:48.552
ACTUALLY AFTER MY FATHER Là

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:49.986
PASSED AWAY --

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:51.988
AND I WAS WORKING --

00:49:52.055 --> 00:49:54.091
ACTUALLY I WAS IN HEALTH CARE

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:55.892
WITH MY HUSBAND FATHER IN LAW.

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:57.327
WENT AND THEN I RETIRED AND WENT

00:49:57.394 --> 00:49:58.228
TO VOLUNTEERING GOT HIRED AT THE

00:49:58.295 --> 00:49:59.730

00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:02.099
AND THEN MY MOTHER IN LAW WAS

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:03.734
DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER'S.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.069
SO SHE WOULD COME FROM MODERATE

00:50:06.136 --> 00:50:07.237
TO HEAR TO GET HER HEALTH CARE

00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:09.706
AND SEE HER DOCTORS OR TO GILROY.

00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:12.209
AND STAY WITH US AND THEN SHE'D

00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:15.345
GO HOME THE SO WE WERE PREPARED

00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:20.050
TO TAKE HER AND AND FORGETTING

00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:22.219

00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:24.354
FOR HER PREMIUMS AND TRYING TO

00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:26.156
KEEP OUR HOME GOING.

00:50:26.223 --> 00:50:26.656
WELL MY HUSBAND WAS SELF

FAMILY WOULD COME TO SEE BOTH OF

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:34.998
THEM AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND SO

00:50:35.065 --> 00:50:36.933
WE WERE HOUSING PEOPLE AND

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.069

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:50.714
IN ALL OF THESE COMMUNITY

00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:52.582
SLIGHTLY --

00:50:52.649 --> 00:50:54.151
AND HER HUSBAND.

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:56.319
WAS HER CARE GIVER THAN HE WAS

00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:58.255
DIAGNOSED WITH LUNG CANCER.

00:50:58.321 --> 00:50:59.489
AND HER HE INJURED HIMSELF

00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:02.359

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:14.171
AND HE DIDN'T LAST TO MONTHS AND

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:16.306
SO NOW SHE'S DEPRESSED.

00:51:16.373 --> 00:51:17.974
HE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF HERSELF HE

00:51:18.041 --> 00:51:20.177
WAS HER CARE GIVER SO I WAS

00:51:20.243 --> 00:51:21.011

THE GRAND KIDS WOULD BE THE

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:56.913
PRIORITY SINCE I WORKED ALL.

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:58.415

00:53:34.077 --> 00:53:34.811
PRETTY MUCH ADDRESSED AN

00:53:34.878 --> 00:53:36.446
INCREASE IN PREMIUMS FOR

00:53:36.513 --> 00:53:37.981
INSURANCE COPAYS.

00:53:38.048 --> 00:53:39.516
THE PRESCRIPTIONS ARE OUT OF OUT

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:41.685
OF THIS WORLD I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

00:53:41.751 --> 00:53:43.420
THE FAMILIES ARE LIVING FURTHER

00:53:43.486 --> 00:53:45.255
APART AND WITH FEWER CHILDREN

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:46.356
ARE NOT CHILDREN.

00:53:46.423 --> 00:53:48.158
THE COST OF EVERYTHING HAS RISEN

00:53:48.224 --> 00:53:52.095
NOT JUST HEALTH FOOD UTILITIES I

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:53.563
MEAN JUST BUYING.

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:56.099
IT SACRAMENTO RENTING A PLACE OF

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:57.968
HOUSING IS OFTEN ON AFFORDABLE

00:53:58.034 --> 00:53:59.002
FOR PEOPLE.

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:00.370
AND THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED ALL

00:54:00.437 --> 00:54:02.172
THEIR LIVES DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

00:54:02.238 --> 00:54:04.507
TO FALL BACK ON THE RECESSION

00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:05.675
WIPED OUT.

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:06.509
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:09.145
AND YOU DON'T.

00:54:09.212 --> 00:54:10.947
YOU MAKE MORE THAN WHAT YOU.

00:54:11.014 --> 00:54:12.282
WHAT QUALIFIES YOU FOR ANY

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:14.117
ASSISTANT BUT NOT ENOUGH TO BE

00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:16.052
SUSTAINABLE AND TO HAVE A

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:17.854
HEALTHY LIFE OR TO HAVE SOMEBODY

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:18.722
COME IN AND HELP YOU?

00:54:18.788 --> 00:54:20.790
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T.

00:54:20.857 --> 00:54:23.793
YOU JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT --

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.195
IN -- ONE OF

00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:25.762
THE LATEST THINGS THAT I'M

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:28.365
FINDING.

00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:30.166
MOST EMPLOYERS ARE HIRING PART

00:54:30.233 --> 00:54:32.335
TIME PEOPLE WITH NO BENEFITS.

00:54:32.402 --> 00:54:34.004
SO NOT ONLY DO YOU NOT WANT TO

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:35.605
SAY ANYTHING AT WORK BUT YOU

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:37.073
DON'T HAVE YOUR BENEFITS THAT

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.275
YOU CAN TAKE FMLA THAT YOU CAN

00:54:39.342 --> 00:54:40.644
TAKE VACATION OR SICK LEAVE

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.112
YOU'RE NOT THERE YOU DON'T GET

00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:43.346
PAID.

00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:44.848
THAT IS A HUGE ISSUE WITH SOME

00:54:44.914 --> 00:54:46.650
OF THESE.

00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:47.917
AND I'M BRINGING IT UP BECAUSE I

00:54:47.984 --> 00:54:50.453
HAVE FAMILY FRIENDS AND PEOPLE

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.521
THAT I WORKED WITH.

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:53.189
THAT ARE TAKING CURRENTLY TAKING

00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:55.659
CARE OF THEIR LOVED ONES.

00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:56.960
THAT ARE SOMETIMES IN THE SAME

00:54:57.027 --> 00:54:58.461
SITUATION.

00:54:58.528 --> 00:55:00.096
I KNOW YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:01.131
EVERYTHING.

00:55:01.197 --> 00:55:03.133
BUT AT THE SAME TIME SOMETHING

00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:04.901
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:06.403
ALL RIGHT NOW.

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:07.370
I'M A LITTLE UNFOCUSED BECAUSE

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:11.207
WE'RE MOVING INTO A TOMORROW OR

00:55:11.274 --> 00:55:12.342
THURSDAY.

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:14.177
AREN'T MY HUSBAND MY SON BOUGHT

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:16.012
A HOME AND IT HAS AN IN LAW UNIT

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:20.684
BECAUSE WE WILL OUR SON IN LAW.

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:22.552
OUR SON AND DAUGHTER IN LAW WERE

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:24.654
WE'VE HAD A COMBINED HOME FOR

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:26.356

THE DISEASE WE LEARNED A LOT BUT

00:58:08.918 --> 00:58:11.988
A REALITY WE HAD NO IDEA THAT

00:58:12.055 --> 00:58:12.989
WE'D BE FACING.

00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:14.557
ABOUT FIVE YEARS INTO THE

00:58:14.624 --> 00:58:15.825
DIAGNOSIS IT BECAME QUITE

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:18.094
APPARENT TO THE FAMILY THAT SHE

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:21.865
IT WAS DECIDED IT WAS BEST FOR

00:58:21.931 --> 00:58:23.433
HER TO SACRAMENTO TO LIVE WITH

00:58:23.499 --> 00:58:24.701
ME AND MY HUSBAND.

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:27.170
WE ARE EMPTY NESTERS AT THE TIME

00:58:27.237 --> 00:58:28.371
MY CHILDREN COLLEGE.

00:58:28.438 --> 00:58:29.472
ALTHOUGH I WAS STILL WORKING

00:58:29.539 --> 00:58:32.342
FULL TIME.

00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:34.077
HER HEALTH AND SAFETY BECAME MY

00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:35.712
PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY.

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:37.614
A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TELL US FOR

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.816
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.

00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:40.950
THAT MUCH TO SHARE ABOUT THIS

00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:42.218
JOURNEY BUT I'M GOING TO FOCUS

00:58:42.285 --> 00:58:43.720
ON THREE MAJOR ASPECTS.

00:58:43.786 --> 00:58:44.587
THE STRUGGLE TO GET THE

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:45.755
NECESSARY IF NECESSARY

00:58:45.822 --> 00:58:47.156
INDICATION TRAINING TO TAKE ON

00:58:47.223 --> 00:58:48.691
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CARE

00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:50.326
GIVING FOR ANOTHER ADULT.

00:58:50.393 --> 00:58:52.161
THE FINANCIAL COSTS IN THE

00:58:52.228 --> 00:58:54.197
EMOTIONAL TURMOIL.

00:58:54.264 --> 00:58:56.499
SO WHEN I GO CREE TO TAKE ON

00:58:56.566 --> 00:58:58.501
THIS ROLE RECALL THAT IT DIDN'T

00:58:58.568 --> 00:59:01.771
SEEM ALL HAVE DONE I FAILED TO

00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:03.039
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT MY

00:59:03.106 --> 00:59:03.573
MOTHER'S CONDITION WAS NOT

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.241
STATIC.

00:59:05.308 --> 00:59:06.910
IT WOULD DRIVE ME OUT THE CHECK

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:08.111
DIGIT DRASTICALLY CHANGE OVER

00:59:08.177 --> 00:59:10.046
THE COMING WEEKS MONTHS AND

00:59:10.113 --> 00:59:11.347
YEARS.

00:59:11.414 --> 00:59:12.548
WORKING MY MOTHER TO THE HOUSE

00:59:12.615 --> 00:59:13.816
HELD WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE

00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:15.985
DELIBERATE STEPS THAT WE TOOK

00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:17.487
WHEN HE BROUGHT NEW ADDITIONS TO

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:18.354
OUR FAMILY IN THE FORM OF OUR

00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:20.056
CHILDREN.

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:21.591
AT THAT TIME.

00:59:21.658 --> 00:59:23.726
A BE HANDLED WITH A THERE ISN'T

00:59:23.793 --> 00:59:25.094
IT GUIDANCE ABANDONED EDUCATION

00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:26.296
AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES IN

00:59:26.362 --> 00:59:27.397
THE FORM PRENATAL CLASSES

00:59:27.463 --> 00:59:29.499
PARENTING CLASSES.

00:59:29.565 --> 00:59:31.267
BOOK FILLED LIBRARY SHELVES.

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:32.635
THERE IS ONLINE RESOURCES AND

00:59:32.702 --> 00:59:35.405
THE LIST WENT ON THERE'S ALSO

00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:37.540
TYPICALLY A LOT FOR ABUNDANT

00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:39.342
RESOURCE ADVICE AND SUPPORT FROM

00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:41.244
FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:43.112
THEY WOULD TURN INTO US IN

00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:46.916
TELESERYES OF AND THEY ALSO

00:59:46.983 --> 00:59:48.618
OFFER CHILDCARE FOOD OTHER

00:59:48.685 --> 00:59:50.353
SUPPORTIVE WORDS AND ACTIONS.

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.322
NOTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENED WHEN

00:59:52.388 --> 00:59:53.790
MOM CAME TO LIVE WITH US.

00:59:53.856 --> 00:59:54.958
PLAYING FIELD IT FIRSTHAND THE

00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:55.758
COLD REALITY OF THE STIGMA

00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:58.227
ASSOCIATED WITH DIMENSION AGING

00:59:58.294 --> 01:00:00.229
THAT EXIST IN OUR SOCIETY AND

01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:02.532
CULTURE.

01:00:02.598 --> 01:00:05.668
IT'S SILENT.

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:06.836
YET IT STILL MANY QUESTIONS WITH

01:00:06.903 --> 01:00:08.304
NEW ISSUES CROPPING UP

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:10.406
CONSTANTLY I SEARCHED HIGH AND

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:11.541
LOW FOR RESOURCES.

01:00:11.607 --> 01:00:12.842
WOULD I TURN TO FOR ADVICE AND

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:13.843

THINK THE TIME HAS COME FOR US

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:14.082
TO REALLY BE AT THE CALL ABOUT

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:17.119
THIS. TO GIVE IT CONSIDERATION.

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:18.353
TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:23.058
CAN'T TO THIS. FOR FOR YEARS AND

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:23.592
YEARS WITHOUT IT TAKING A

01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:26.261
PHYSICAL TOLL.

01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:27.496
PRESS THE CARE TO ME WHEN I TOOK

01:14:27.563 --> 01:14:28.897
MY MOM.

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:30.699
TO THE DAY PROGRAM I WOULD GET A

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:33.535
HUG FROM SOMEBODY IN A DAILY.

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:37.806
IT SAY IT'S GONNA BE OKAY AND

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:42.177
NOBODY ELSE OFFERED HUGS.

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:42.978
BUT I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:45.180
TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE WAY OF

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:47.049
BRINGING CARE GIVERS LETTING

01:14:47.115 --> 01:14:48.584
THEM KNOW WHO THEY ARE BECAUSE

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:50.052
CARE GIVERS DON'T SELF IDENTIFY.

01:14:50.118 --> 01:14:52.120
SO WE DO HAVE TO HAVE A

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:54.056
COMBINATION BETWEEN THE CURRENT

01:14:54.122 --> 01:14:55.958
SOCIAL SUPPORT SYSTEMS LIKE THE

01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:57.392
CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS AT

01:14:57.459 --> 01:15:00.195
HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS WHO

01:15:00.262 --> 01:15:02.030
IDENTIFIED THE CARE GIVERS.

01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:03.599
SO THAT THERE'S A STRONGER OF

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:05.968
DISCUSSION KIND OF REFERRAL

01:15:06.034 --> 01:15:08.070
SYSTEM BETWEEN THOSE --

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:10.672
TWO AS BECAUSE THERE ARE SYSTEMS

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:13.775
OUT THERE OF COURSE ARE THE CARE

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:15.377
TO RESEARCH CENTERS.

01:15:15.444 --> 01:15:17.880
BIASED BUT THEY DO NEED FUNDING

01:15:17.946 --> 01:15:19.748
BECAUSE OF THE THEY COULD BE OUT

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:21.583
IN THE COMMUNITY PROVIDING ALL

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:23.452
THE EDUCATION TRAINING ALL OF

01:15:23.518 --> 01:15:25.320
THAT THAT IS FUNDED BUT WE

01:15:25.387 --> 01:15:26.788
CERTAINLY NEED AN INFUSION.

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:29.024
OF FUNDS THAT ALLOW FOR US TO

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:31.059
DELIVER IN MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:32.794
ACROSS THE STATE.

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:34.463
AND IT MAY CULTURALLY SENSITIVE

01:15:34.529 --> 01:15:38.133
WAYS I'D RESPITE BECAUSE WITH

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.568
CARE GIVERS COME IN THEY DON'T

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:41.436
WANT THE FRAGMENTATION.

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:43.038
I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:44.907
BIGGEST ISSUES WE HAVE IS

01:15:44.973 --> 01:15:46.541
FRAGMENTATION SO WHEN THEY CAN

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:48.243
GO TO WHAT I CALL ONE STOP

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:49.912
SHOPPING CENTERS.

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:51.246
AND SOMEBODY TALKS TO THEM

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:52.281
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:53.782
THEY NEED NO ONE CALLS AND SAYS

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:55.751
I'M A CARE GIVER I NEED SERVICES.

01:15:55.817 --> 01:15:58.420
THEY CALLAND SAY MY MOM IS

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:00.989
HAVING TROUBLE AND CAN YOU HELP

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:02.424
ME AND THEN YOU HAVE TO HAVE

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:03.859
SOMEONE ON THE OTHER IN WHO

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:05.227
UNDERSTANDS HOW TO SAY.

01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:07.663
LET'S DISCUSS YOUR MOM BUT LET'S

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:11.033
ALSO TALK ABOUT YOU.

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:12.034
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD I MEAN

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.369
THERE'S THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO --

01:16:14.436 --> 01:16:16.204
IN THIS TOPIC AND IT'S T'S HARD

01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:17.272
TO DELINEATE WHAT SHOULD COME

01:16:17.339 --> 01:16:21.009
FIRST AND WHAT THE TIMING IS AND

01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:22.110
THAT THERE'S JUST SO MUCH BUT

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:23.879
I'LL BUT I ALSO WANT TO ADD TO

01:16:23.946 --> 01:16:24.313
IT.

01:16:24.379 --> 01:16:25.781
AND I'M I'M FIGURE THAT ONE OUT

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:27.249
BUT I ALSO WANT TO ADD TO THE

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:29.217
MIX THAT THIS THIS REALLY DOES

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:30.819
DESERVE AN INVESTMENT IN OUR

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:34.957
EDUCATION SYSTEM --

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:37.492
DOING GERIATRICS OR CARE GIVING

01:16:37.559 --> 01:16:38.393

EMPLOYMENT --

01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:44.700
SATISFACTION OFF OFF THE RAILS I

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:46.702

ENOUGH OF IT I KNOW THAT --

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.239
IF WE OFFERED MORE GERONTOLOGY

01:16:51.306 --> 01:16:53.075

01:16:53.141 --> 01:16:54.743

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:10.759
WHO GO INTO THAT WORK IF IF IT

01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:12.461

THEY WERE AWARE OF IT SO.

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:15.097

ANYTHING IN THESE AREAS.

01:21:33.788 --> 01:21:35.123
ANYWHERE ELSE --

YOUR ORGANIZATIONS --

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:39.261
I DON'T KNOW THOSE ARE MY

01:21:39.327 --> 01:21:41.496

CALIFORNIA WE HAVE PAID FMILY

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:48.470
LEAVE.

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:50.238
BUT IT ISN'T --

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:52.507
THERE'S NO JOB PROTECTION. FOR

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:53.375

01:21:53.441 --> 01:21:55.443
BEING UNDER UTILIZED BY AND I

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:57.012
KNOW SENATOR JACKSON DOES THIS

01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:59.281
BY OUR FAMILY CARE GIVERS

01:21:59.347 --> 01:22:01.683
BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST NOT --

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.451
HEARING ENOUGH ABOUT IT PLUS THE

01:22:03.518 --> 01:22:06.588
WAGE REPLACEMENT --

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:09.224

INCOME --

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:12.527
AND A LITTLE BECAUSE THERE IS

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:14.396
THAT FLEXIBILITY BUT IT'S HARD

01:22:14.462 --> 01:22:16.231
TO GET THROUGH THAT SYSTEM I

01:22:16.298 --> 01:22:18.366
AMONG THE PANEL FOR WITH EDT AND

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:19.701
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO MAKE IT

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:22.237
EASIER FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS WHO.

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:23.772
WHO -- YOU

01:22:23.838 --> 01:22:24.372
DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT ALL AT

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:26.341
ONCE AND YOU CAN TAKE IT

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:27.642
INTERMITTENTLY BUT THE

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:30.045
INTERMITTENT IS VERY DIFFICULT

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:31.913
IN TERMS OF THE PAPERWORK FOR

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:32.380
THAT.

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:34.416
SO GIVE AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:36.685
ABOUT THE SYSTEM I WOULD AGREE

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:38.853
WITH YOU AND THE MORE THAT WE

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.789
COULD HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE

01:22:40.855 --> 01:22:41.623
SYSTEM.

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:44.893
THAT DOES KIND OF SAY COME IN WE

01:22:44.959 --> 01:22:46.828
KNOW IF YOU SELF IDENTIFY THAT'S

01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:48.363
ONE OF THE HARDER THINGS IS TO

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:49.597
GET THAT CARE GIVERS SELF

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:51.733
IDENTIFICATION.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.435
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU JUST UP%

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:55.737
HERE GEARS SPOUSE OR YOUR THE

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:56.871

YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND TRYING TO

01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:59.374
TAKE CARE SOMEONE --

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:01.109
SO WE DO HAVE TO WORK PART OF

01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:04.446
THAT IS GETTING THE WORD OUT AND

01:23:04.512 --> 01:23:05.413
HAVING ENOUGH.

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.649
ADVERTISING AND PEOPLE TO GET

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:10.585
THAT WORD OUT. TO CORRECT THANK

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:14.756
YOU FOR LETTING ME AND I'M.

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:17.492
I'M SORRY.

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:19.227
I SEE IT AS A AS A PROCESS THAT

01:23:19.294 --> 01:23:19.828
WOULD BE --

01:23:19.894 --> 01:23:21.463
PART OF WHEN THE DIAGNOSIS IS

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:22.964
GIVEN.

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:24.199
THAT THEY WOULD BE EITHER.

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:25.333
REFERRED.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:28.837
TO AN AGENCY OR OF A PLACE THAT.

01:23:28.903 --> 01:23:30.405
WE'RE GONNA SEND YOU THERE AND

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:32.073
THEN WHAT THEY DO IS THEY GO

01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:33.508
OVER WHATEVER THAT DISEASE

01:23:33.575 --> 01:23:35.877
PROCESSES AND WHAT OF THE

01:23:35.944 --> 01:23:37.379
SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN

01:23:37.445 --> 01:23:39.781
CASE YOU SHOULD NEED THEM.

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:40.749
BOB.

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:42.016
I MEAN WHEN I RENT A HEALTH

01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:43.952
EDUCATION CENTER I DID THAT AND

01:23:44.018 --> 01:23:45.019
I'M NOT A HEALTH CARE

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:47.322
PROFESSIONAL I A PROVIDED THE

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:49.190
AGENCY OF THE DIAGNOSIS THEY

01:23:49.257 --> 01:23:49.924
WERE GIVEN.

01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:50.725
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW ALL THE

01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:53.762
SERVICES THAT ARE.

01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:55.830
AND THEN I READ IN THE PAPER.

01:23:55.897 --> 01:23:57.399
SOME COUNTIES DON'T EVEN OFFER

01:23:57.465 --> 01:23:59.134
SOME OF THESE SERVICES SO MY

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.568
FAMILY AND MODERATE CAN'T

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:02.237
BENEFIT FROM SOME OF THE

01:24:02.303 --> 01:24:03.238
SERVICES WE HAVE HERE.

01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:06.708
BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT SO I

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:08.243
WOULD BE TALKING TO THEM AND

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:09.244
GIVING THEM THE WRONG

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:12.247
INFORMATION SO WHEN MY FATHER

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:25.894
OF CANCER AND WHAT WE COULD DO --

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.228
IT WASN'T FROM THE HEALTH CARE

01:24:27.295 --> 01:24:29.130
SYSTEM IT WAS ON MY OWN BUT YET

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:29.864

I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO ASK FOR

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:58.526

THEY HAVE TO COVER EVERYTHING

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:24.719
BUT THERE SHOULD BE A PATHWAY

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:27.655
AND THERE'S NOT.

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:29.257

CALL AN ORGANIZATION THAT.

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:39.434
DEPENDS ON WHO I GET

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:39.734

AND THEN IT SEEMS LIKE A HEALTH

01:25:57.986 --> 01:25:59.487
PLAN SHOULD BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE

01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:01.489

01:28:13.655 --> 01:28:14.188
SERVICE PROGRAM TO CALIFORNIA

01:28:14.255 --> 01:28:15.757
STATE UNIVERSITY CHICO RESEARCH

01:28:15.823 --> 01:28:17.659
FOUNDATION --

01:28:17.725 --> 01:28:19.227
I'M FORTUNATE IN THAT --

01:28:19.293 --> 01:28:20.795
MY AGENCIES A DESIGNATED.

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:22.830
AREA AGENCY ON AGING AND WE ARE

01:28:22.897 --> 01:28:24.332
A DESIGNATED CARE GIVER RESOURCE

01:28:24.399 --> 01:28:24.832
CENTER.

01:28:24.899 --> 01:28:26.734
OFF SO I HAVE BOTH FEDERAL FUNDS

01:28:26.801 --> 01:28:28.936
IN STATE FUNDS AND ON THAT IT

01:28:29.003 --> 01:28:31.105
GIVES ME SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES --

01:28:31.172 --> 01:28:32.607
I'M ABLE TO PROVIDE.

01:28:32.674 --> 01:28:34.308
A FULL MENU OF SERVICES FOR CARE

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:36.010
GIVERS THAT IF I WAS JUST CARE

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:38.012
GIVE RESOURCE CENTER REGISTRABLE

01:28:38.079 --> 01:28:39.113
A WOULD BE LIMITED SO.

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.749
I FEEL FORTUNATE --

01:28:41.816 --> 01:28:44.819
HAVING BOTH FUNDING STREAMS NOT

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:46.387
ONLY GIVES ME A BETTER A MENU OF

01:28:46.454 --> 01:28:48.056
SERVICES TO OFFER.

01:28:48.122 --> 01:28:49.857
BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS ME TO MATCH

01:28:49.924 --> 01:28:51.426
THOSE DOLLARS AGAINST EACH OTHER

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:53.161
AND I THINK AT LONG MENTIONED

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:54.562
EARLIER THAT --

01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:56.564
UNDER THE TRIPLE A.'S THAT IT IS

01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:58.399
LOCAL COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBLE

01:28:58.466 --> 01:29:00.668
FOR COMING UP WITH THE MATCH AND

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:01.869
SO THE STATE FUNDED CARE

01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:03.438
RESOURCE CENTER ALLOWS ME TO

01:29:03.504 --> 01:29:05.373
PROVIDE THE TWENTY FIRST PERCENT

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.208
25% MATCH THE PROGRAM.

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:07.709
BUT AGAIN I THINK MOST

01:29:07.775 --> 01:29:10.878
IMPORTANTLY I'M ABLE. TO TO

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:12.580
LEVERAGE MORE SERVICES FOR THE

01:29:12.647 --> 01:29:14.682
CARE GIVERS NOW THAT MY SERVICE

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:15.950
AREA IT.

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:17.185
CONSTITUTES TEN COUNTIES IS

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:19.287
QUITE LARGE --

01:29:19.353 --> 01:29:21.322
IT'S VERY CHALLENGING --

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:21.856
IF YOU'RE A CARE GIVER AND

01:29:21.923 --> 01:29:24.525
YOU'RE LIVING IN --

01:29:24.592 --> 01:29:27.428
AND YOU NEED ASSISTANCE --

01:29:27.495 --> 01:29:28.529
IT'S A LONG WAY TO TRAVEL IF

01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:29.997
YOU'RE GONNA GO SEE A SPECIALIST

01:29:30.064 --> 01:29:31.599
YOU KNOW YOU'RE TRAVELING TO

01:29:31.666 --> 01:29:33.101
DAVIS OR YOUR TRAVELING

01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:34.769
SACRAMENTO --

01:29:34.836 --> 01:29:36.170
INFORMALLY WE'VE KIND OF FIGURED

01:29:36.237 --> 01:29:37.872
IT COULD BE LIKE FIVE SIX

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:38.473
HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SOMEBODY

01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:40.341
TAKE A TRIP TO THE HOSPITAL.

01:29:40.408 --> 01:29:40.942
BUT THE PERSON THAT'S IN A

01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:43.244
SEPARATE ALZHEIMER'S AND SUCH SO.

01:29:43.311 --> 01:29:45.713
THERE'S SOME REAL CHALLENGES IN

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:47.348
OUR AREA --

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:50.084
PART OF THOSE CHALLENGES HAS

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:52.320
REQUIRED THAT WE APPROACH OUR

01:29:52.386 --> 01:29:55.223
SERVICES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT --

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:57.191
WE HAVE TO BE VERY FLEXIBLE WITH

01:29:57.258 --> 01:29:59.060
THEIR CARE GIVERS --

01:29:59.127 --> 01:30:01.028
SO THEY CAN ACCESS OUR PROGRAMS.

01:30:01.095 --> 01:30:03.531
SO --

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:05.032
RESPITE IS TALKED A LOT ABOUT

01:30:05.099 --> 01:30:06.434
AND IT'S IT'S A WONDERFUL

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:07.602
PROGRAM FOR CAREGIVERS THEY

01:30:07.668 --> 01:30:09.303
NEEDED BUT THE FUNDING THAT WE

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:10.872
HAVE WE JUST WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:30:10.938 --> 01:30:12.340
ABILITY TO GIVE RESPITE TO EVERY

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:13.174
CARE GIVER.

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:14.742
NOT ONLY THAT SOME OF OUR

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:16.377
COMMUNITIES ARE STILL RURAL

01:30:16.444 --> 01:30:16.978
THERE'S NOT EVEN REALLY THE

01:30:17.044 --> 01:30:18.980

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:25.119
TRYING TO FIND AN ORGANIZATION

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:26.320
THAT HAS --

01:30:26.387 --> 01:30:28.122
RESPITE WORKERS PLUMAS COUNTY

01:30:34.529 --> 01:30:35.596
NO ONE'S GOING TO DO THAT SO IS

01:30:35.663 --> 01:30:37.198

OUR CLIENTS RULES THE EDUCATION

FOLKS AT HOME AND WALL RESPITE

01:30:58.719 --> 01:31:00.188
IS ALWAYS THERE AND IT'S PART OF

01:31:00.254 --> 01:31:01.789
THAT IT'S IT'S NOT THE COMPLETE

01:31:01.856 --> 01:31:02.690
PACKAGE.

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:05.593
AND I WANT TO SHARE A STORY

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:07.328
ABOUT ONE OF OUR CARE GIVERS

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:08.729
THAT'D COME TO US AND IT WAS A

01:31:08.796 --> 01:31:10.131
COUPLE YEARS BACK.

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:12.433
THIS PERSON CAME AND WAS A

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:13.768
LITTLE DESPONDENT WAS INTERESTED

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:15.336
IN THE PROGRAM BUT WASN'T QUITE

01:31:15.403 --> 01:31:16.037
SURE.

01:31:16.103 --> 01:31:19.407
BUT WE INVITED HER TO OUR ANNUAL

01:31:19.473 --> 01:31:20.474
RETREAT IT'S A THREE DAY RETREAT

01:31:20.541 --> 01:31:22.176
WHERE WE TAKE THE CARE GIVERS

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:23.778
WOULD TAKE AWAY WE COULDN'T

01:31:23.845 --> 01:31:25.213
EDUCATION TRAINING --

01:31:25.279 --> 01:31:26.247
WE PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:28.716
THEM TO BE OUT OF THE HOUSE --

01:31:28.783 --> 01:31:30.351
DO SOME SELF FULFILLMENT SOME

01:31:30.418 --> 01:31:31.853
SELF GROWTH.

01:31:31.919 --> 01:31:33.955
AND CHEERFUL STAND OFFICE SHE

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.356
LIKE THE PROGRAM BUT THEN SHE

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:36.524
WASN'T QUITE THERE.

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:38.326
BUT SHE CAME BACK IN TO CONTINUE

01:31:38.392 --> 01:31:40.294
WITH OUR PROGRAM SHE DID --

01:31:40.361 --> 01:31:42.163
WEEKLY MONTHLY --

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:43.364
SUPPORT GROUPS --

01:31:43.431 --> 01:31:45.366
SHE TENDED.

01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:49.070
AND SHE BUT STILL STANDOFFISH

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:50.137
AND THEN THE SECOND YEAR SHE

01:31:50.204 --> 01:31:51.539
CAME BACK AND DID THREE TREAT

01:31:51.606 --> 01:31:53.007
WITH US AGAIN AND THIS YEAR.

01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:54.475
WE SAW A DEFINITE DIFFERENCE AND

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:55.443
HER -- SHE

01:31:55.509 --> 01:31:56.711
ASKED A ROOM WITH ONE OF THE

01:31:56.777 --> 01:31:58.412
OTHER CARE GIVERS SHE WAS MORE

01:31:58.479 --> 01:32:00.181
ENGAGED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE

01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:02.083
WEEKEND IN THE PROCESS.

01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:04.051
AND NOT TOO LONG AGO WE GOT A

01:32:04.118 --> 01:32:05.486
CALL FROM RECENT MAKE SURE YOU

01:32:05.553 --> 01:32:06.687
PUT ME DOWN ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO

01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:08.089
GO TO THE RETREAT THIS YEAR

01:32:08.155 --> 01:32:09.323
WHICH WAS A REALLY GOOD SIGN.

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:10.958
IT WAS INTERESTING WHEN WE LOOK

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:12.693
BACK AT HER --

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:15.329
RECORD THAT EACH YEAR SINCE THE

01:32:15.396 --> 01:32:17.465
BEGINNING SHE ASKED FOR LESS AND

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:19.200
LESS RESPITE BECAUSE HE HAD

01:32:19.267 --> 01:32:21.135
GAINED THE TOOLS FROM THESE

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:24.372
PROGRAMS TO CARE FOR HER FAMILY

01:32:24.438 --> 01:32:24.839
MEMBER BUT I THINK AS

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:27.341
IMPORTANTLY TO CARE FOR HERSELF

01:32:27.408 --> 01:32:29.911
SO SHE WASN'T AS DEPENDENT ON

01:32:29.977 --> 01:32:30.244
THIS PROGRAM.

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:31.612
NOW.

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:33.080
IN MY TENT COUNTIES WE HAVE A

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:34.649
BUDGET OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

01:32:34.715 --> 01:32:36.817
AND EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO

01:32:36.884 --> 01:32:38.319
IN SOME WAYS IS PRETTY GOOD WERE

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:40.922
SERVING ABOUT. TWO HUNDRED

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:42.223
REGISTERED FAMILY CAREGIVERS IN

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:43.557
OUR PROGRAM.

01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:45.192
IF I IF I RUN THAT OUT IN THE

01:32:45.259 --> 01:32:47.495
YEAR IT'S ABOUT THREE THOUSAND

01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:48.095
NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CARE

01:32:48.162 --> 01:32:48.729
GIVER.

01:32:48.796 --> 01:32:50.865
NOW YOU COMPARE THAT TO WHAT THE

01:32:50.932 --> 01:32:52.700
COST OF THE BED Là SKILLED

01:32:52.767 --> 01:32:55.202
NURSING FACILITY AS AND I WOULD

01:32:55.269 --> 01:32:57.138
ARGUE THE MAJORITY OF THOSE TWO

01:32:57.204 --> 01:32:58.572
HUNDRED PEOPLE COULD PROBABLY BE

01:32:58.639 --> 01:32:59.507
IN A BAD.

01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:01.208
BUT IT'S THAT CARE GIVER THOSE

01:33:01.275 --> 01:33:02.843
WILLING.

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:05.146
TO STICK WITH THE PARENT STICK

01:33:05.212 --> 01:33:06.380
WITH HER AUNT OR UNCLE THEIR

01:33:06.447 --> 01:33:08.316
LOVED ONE AND WORK WITH THEM.

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:09.684
BUT I THINK THE ONLY WAY THAT

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:11.285
THEY CAN REALLY DO THAT

01:33:11.352 --> 01:33:11.819
SUCCESSFULLY.

01:33:11.886 --> 01:33:14.755
IS IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THESE

01:33:14.822 --> 01:33:17.091
CARE GIVER PROGRAMS SO THAT'S

01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:18.559
KINDOF OUR STORY AND AND I'VE

01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:19.627
GOT.

01:33:19.694 --> 01:33:20.661
PLENTY MORE DETAILS BUT I THINK

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:23.230
OTHER PEOPLE NEED TO SPEAK GONNA

01:33:23.297 --> 01:33:24.131
SAY THAT.

01:33:24.198 --> 01:33:25.833
THESE ARE INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:27.034
PROGRAMS AND I THINK SOME

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:28.035
QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP IN THE

01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:29.670
LAST PANEL WHAT ARE SOME THINGS

01:33:29.737 --> 01:33:30.871
WE CAN LOOK AT AND DO TO BRING

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:31.839
FORWARD.

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:33.774
I THINK BETWEEN THE CARE GIVER

01:33:33.841 --> 01:33:35.376
RESOURCE CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:36.677
AND THE TRIPLE A.'S YOU HAVE A

01:33:36.744 --> 01:33:38.713
PHENOMENAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

01:33:38.779 --> 01:33:41.482
ALREADY EXISTS IT'S IN PLACE AND

01:33:41.549 --> 01:33:42.083
IT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR A LONG

01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:43.150
TIME.

01:33:43.217 --> 01:33:47.855
I THINK WITH RELATIVELY.

01:33:47.922 --> 01:33:49.857
MINOR AMOUNT OF FUNDING.

01:33:49.924 --> 01:33:51.359
THIS EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE CAN

01:33:51.425 --> 01:33:52.760
BE ALTERING FOR THE DIRECTION I

01:33:52.827 --> 01:33:53.761
THINK THAT THE STATE OF

01:33:53.828 --> 01:33:54.695
CALIFORNIA IS GOING NOW

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:54.996

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:25.159
OUR CARE GIVERS AS WELL AS THE

01:34:25.226 --> 01:34:26.794
REALLY IMPORTANT RESOURCES THAT

01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:28.662
ARE AVAILABLE TO SERVE THE

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:30.131
POPULATION.

01:34:30.197 --> 01:34:31.599
BUT THE FOCUS OF MY REMARKS

01:34:31.665 --> 01:34:32.666
ACTUALLY STEMS FROM A LOT OF THE

01:34:32.733 --> 01:34:34.168
CONVERSATION YOU JUST HAD IN THE

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:35.836
PRIOR PANEL WHICH IS REALLY

01:34:35.903 --> 01:34:36.937
CRITICAL.

01:34:37.004 --> 01:34:38.773
IT RELATES TO HOW CARE GIVERS

01:34:38.839 --> 01:34:42.610
ACCESS THE INFORMATION AND

01:34:42.676 --> 01:34:44.812
SERVICES THAT THEY NEED.

01:34:44.879 --> 01:34:46.047
ARMS SO L. L. ELOQUENTLY

01:34:46.113 --> 01:34:48.482
EXPRESSED BY MRS SALDOVAR MISS

01:34:48.549 --> 01:34:50.284
MARK HAS AND DR BENTON WHEN CARE

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:51.419
GIVERS ARE PLACED INTO A

01:34:51.485 --> 01:34:52.953
SITUATION WHERE THEY KNOW THAT

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.088
THEIR LOVED.

01:34:54.155 --> 01:34:56.657
ONE NEED SOME SORT OF SUPPORT IN

01:34:56.724 --> 01:34:57.825
THE HOME OR IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:34:57.892 --> 01:34:59.326
THEY USUALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:00.928
GO FOR HELP THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:35:00.995 --> 01:35:03.230
THEY NEED AND THEY DON'T KNOW

01:35:03.297 --> 01:35:04.065
HOW TO GET IT.

01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:06.667
SO EVERY DAY WE HEAR STORIES OF

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:08.135
PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO WEAVE

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:09.737
TOGETHER THE SERVICES AND

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:11.472
SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED TO

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:13.074
REMAIN AT HOME AND AVOID

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:14.542
INSTITUTIONALIZATION.

01:35:14.608 --> 01:35:15.843
FAMILIES DON'T KNOW WHERE TO

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:18.879
TURN FOR HELP SERVICES THEIR

01:35:18.946 --> 01:35:20.514
BOUNCE BETWEEN PROGRAMS WITH

01:35:20.581 --> 01:35:22.349
LITTLE ASSURANCES THAT THEIR

01:35:22.416 --> 01:35:23.651
NEEDS CAN BE MET.

01:35:23.717 --> 01:35:25.019
SO THE THE PROBLEM IS REALLY

01:35:25.086 --> 01:35:26.454
MULTI FACETED AND THERE'S A

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.756
NUMBER OF REASONS WHY THE SYSTEM

01:35:28.823 --> 01:35:30.257
IS LIKE THIS AND SO FRAGMENTED.

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:31.892
ON MOST OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT

01:35:31.959 --> 01:35:32.460
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT ALL HAVE

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:34.361
DIFFERENT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

01:35:34.428 --> 01:35:35.663
DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS ARE

01:35:35.729 --> 01:35:37.131
RUN OUT OF SOMETIMES DIFFERENT

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:38.499
DEPARTMENTS.

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:39.500
AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.135
ASSESSMENT PROCESS SEES THOSE

01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:42.570
YOU'VE HEARD YOU CAN BE BOUNCED

01:35:42.636 --> 01:35:44.071
AROUND FROM PROGRAM TO PROGRAM

01:35:44.138 --> 01:35:45.773
WITH DIFFERENT ASSESSMENTS.

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:48.075
AND NOT KNOWING WHETHER YOU'RE

01:35:48.142 --> 01:35:49.577
GOING TO GET EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

01:35:49.643 --> 01:35:50.811
BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT IT

01:35:50.878 --> 01:35:53.114
IS AS A STATE WE CAN DO A LOT

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:53.747
BETTER.

01:35:53.814 --> 01:35:55.449
THEY'RE IS PROMISING POTENTIAL

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:57.017
TO MEET INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND A

01:35:57.084 --> 01:35:58.886
MORE HUMAN CENTERED FASHION WITH

01:35:58.953 --> 01:36:00.888
ACCESS TO A SEAMLESS SET OF

01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:02.123
SERVICES.

01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:03.791
SO AS AN EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA'S

01:36:03.858 --> 01:36:05.426
AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:07.294
CENTERS WHICH ARE CALLED EIGHTY

01:36:07.361 --> 01:36:07.761
ARE SEIZE.

01:36:07.828 --> 01:36:10.397
AND BASIC TO DO JUST THIS THEY

01:36:10.464 --> 01:36:11.565
TRY TO STREAMLINE ACCESS TO

01:36:11.632 --> 01:36:13.200
INFORMATION AND SUPPORTS FOR

01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:14.602
OLDER ADULTS PEOPLE WITH

01:36:14.668 --> 01:36:15.936
DISABILITIES.

01:36:16.003 --> 01:36:17.872
FAMILY CARE GIVERS AND VETERANS

01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:20.307

SUPPORTS. EIGHTY ARE SEIZE

01:36:21.942 --> 01:36:23.377
OPERATE AS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:25.446
AREA AGENCIES ON AGING AND

01:36:25.513 --> 01:36:26.947
CENTERS FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING.

01:36:27.014 --> 01:36:28.749
AND THEY PROVIDE INFORMATION AND

01:36:28.816 --> 01:36:31.285
REFERRAL COUNSELING ABOUT

01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:33.087

SHORT TERM SERVICE COORDINATION

01:36:38.392 --> 01:36:39.493
SO IF YOU NEED A LITTLE HELP IN

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.929
CONNECTING YOUR LOVED ONE WITH A

01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:43.297
SERVICE OR SUPPORT THEY CAN

01:36:43.364 --> 01:36:44.498
PROVIDE THAT.

01:36:44.565 --> 01:36:46.200
AS WELL IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:47.301
TRANSITION HOT --

01:36:47.368 --> 01:36:49.270
SERVICES WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL

01:36:49.336 --> 01:36:52.673
TRANSIT WHEN THEY TRANSITION

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:54.275
FROM A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY

01:36:54.341 --> 01:36:55.576
BACK HOME THOSE ARE OFTEN THE

01:36:55.643 --> 01:36:58.045
MOST CRITICAL TIMES WHEN PEOPLE

01:36:58.112 --> 01:36:59.613
NEED SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ITS

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.882
IN THOSE MOMENTS OF TRANSITION.

01:37:01.949 --> 01:37:03.851
BUT ULTIMATELY THIS MODEL SEEKS

01:37:03.918 --> 01:37:05.719
TO EMPOWER THE CONSUMER TO HAVE

01:37:05.786 --> 01:37:07.154
ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THEY

01:37:07.221 --> 01:37:09.156
NEED TO MAKE THE MOST INFORMED

01:37:09.223 --> 01:37:10.624
CHOICES FOR THEMSELVES.

01:37:10.691 --> 01:37:13.928
AT WAR ON WITH THEIR LOVED ONES.

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:15.029
THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT IN

01:37:15.095 --> 01:37:16.630
CALIFORNIA EIGHTY ARE SEIZE ARE

01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:18.465
AVAILABLE IN ONLY EIGHT OF OUR

01:37:18.532 --> 01:37:20.301
COUNTIES. TO DATE THERE HAS BEEN

01:37:20.367 --> 01:37:22.503
NO STATE GENERAL FUND RESOURCES

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:24.238
COMMITTED TO THE EFFORT.

01:37:24.305 --> 01:37:25.839
AND IN THEIR ONLY HAS BEEN VERY

01:37:25.906 --> 01:37:28.309
LIMITED FUNDING COMING FROM

01:37:28.375 --> 01:37:29.944
FEDERAL GRANTS SO COUNTIES ARE

01:37:30.010 --> 01:37:31.845
LEFT RIGHT NOW THOSE THAT DO

01:37:31.912 --> 01:37:32.713
OPERATE THESE PROGRAMS THEY'RE

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:34.048
TRYING TO PULL TOGETHER THE

01:37:34.114 --> 01:37:36.350
RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED.

01:37:36.417 --> 01:37:37.685
JUST TO KEEP THEM GOING.

01:37:37.751 --> 01:37:39.620
CALIFORNIA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:41.722
BUILD ITS EIGHTY ARE SYNCED AB

01:37:41.789 --> 01:37:43.023
R. C. SYSTEM INTO SOMETHING

01:37:43.090 --> 01:37:44.758
THAT'S MUCH MORE IN LINE WITH

01:37:44.825 --> 01:37:46.460
ITS VISION INTO A NO WRONG DOOR

REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ENTER

01:37:59.106 --> 01:38:00.341

01:38:15.489 --> 01:38:16.557
REALITY.

01:38:16.624 --> 01:38:17.758

01:56:05.024 --> 01:56:06.059
SERIES OF ANTI TELL SOMETHING

01:56:06.125 --> 01:56:07.694
HAPPENS AS AN EXAMPLE MY DAD WAS

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:09.329
DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER'S WITH

01:56:09.395 --> 01:56:10.997
THE LOS ANGELES RIVERSIDE COUNTY

SAW THE STEADY.

01:56:13.633 --> 01:56:15.802
DECLINE --

01:56:15.868 --> 01:56:18.738
MY DAD WAS A TEETOTALER BUT ONE

01:56:18.805 --> 01:56:22.575
OF THE SYMPTOMS OF OF OUTSIDERS

01:56:22.642 --> 01:56:23.743
IS PEOPLE RESORT TO ALCOHOL

01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:24.811
SOMETIMES BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:56:24.877 --> 01:56:26.312
CONFUSED IT KIND OF EASES THEIR

01:56:26.379 --> 01:56:27.513
CONFUSION.

01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:28.815
MY DAD WAS DRIVING IN THE CITY

01:56:28.881 --> 01:56:31.884
OF BELLE DOWN A ONE WAY STREET

01:56:31.951 --> 01:56:33.086
AND GOT ARRESTED FOR DO YOU WHY

01:56:33.152 --> 01:56:33.486
IT.

01:56:33.553 --> 01:56:35.788
IS ALL SO THAT WAS A FLAG TO US

01:56:35.855 --> 01:56:38.424
THAT OKAY WE KIDS NEED A SAMPLE

01:56:38.491 --> 01:56:40.126
OF WE NEED.

01:56:40.193 --> 01:56:41.127
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA

01:56:41.194 --> 01:56:42.095
DO TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PARENTS

01:56:42.161 --> 01:56:43.363
AND AND WE DID IT AND WE HAVE

01:56:43.429 --> 01:56:44.530
THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO DO IT

01:56:44.597 --> 01:56:46.199
MY CONCERN IS WHAT YOU MENTIONED

01:56:46.265 --> 01:56:48.234
THAT -- MANY

01:56:48.301 --> 01:56:49.635
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO.

01:56:49.702 --> 01:56:50.870
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET THE

01:56:50.937 --> 01:56:52.839
SERVICES.

01:56:52.905 --> 01:56:54.974
AND THERE MAY BE A A LOT OF

01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:56.442
RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN

01:56:56.509 --> 01:56:57.744
THE STATE THAT JUST FRANKLY

01:56:57.810 --> 01:56:59.178
AREN'T BEING USE.

01:56:59.245 --> 01:57:00.113
AND SO I WAS THINKING.

01:57:00.179 --> 01:57:02.482
YOU KNOW.

01:57:02.548 --> 01:57:04.450
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE WITH

01:57:04.517 --> 01:57:06.219
DEMENTIA --

01:57:06.285 --> 01:57:07.353
MAYBE SEE.

01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:09.589
EMERGENCY ROOMS ASSISTED LIVING

CONVALESCENT HOMES.

01:57:11.891 --> 01:57:12.625
WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER IN THE

01:57:12.692 --> 01:57:14.694
STATE?

01:57:14.761 --> 01:57:16.162
EVEN IF IT REQUIRES A

01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:17.864
REQUIREMENT THAT WHEN YOU SEE

01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:19.132
SOMEONE THAT IS NOT THE

01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:21.267
DIAGNOSIS OF OF DEMENTIA AS

01:57:21.334 --> 01:57:22.835
YOU'RE JUST CHARGING THEM BACK

01:57:22.902 --> 01:57:24.103
INTO.

01:57:24.170 --> 01:57:25.772
A RESIDENTIAL ENVIRONMENT.

01:57:25.838 --> 01:57:26.773
THAT HERE ARE THE SERVICES THAT

01:57:26.839 --> 01:57:29.409
ARE AVAILABLE.

01:57:29.475 --> 01:57:30.943
MANY OF WHICH MAY BE FREE OF

01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:32.245
CHARGE.

01:57:32.311 --> 01:57:33.346
I DON'T KNOW IF WE CORD DEATH

01:57:33.413 --> 01:57:35.314
COORDINATE THAT THROUGH COUNTIES

01:57:35.381 --> 01:57:37.550
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE NEED.

01:57:37.617 --> 01:57:39.018
TO NUMBER ONE OVERCOME LANGUAGE

01:57:39.085 --> 01:57:41.287
BARRIERS AND WE NEED TO WRITE IT

01:57:41.354 --> 01:57:44.290
IN LAYMAN'S TERMS SO THE PEOPLE

01:57:44.357 --> 01:57:45.992
THAT MAYBE NOT TECH SAVVY.

01:57:46.058 --> 01:57:47.427
CAN USE THEIR PHONE --

01:57:47.493 --> 01:57:49.495
AND BE ABLE TO GET SOMEONE TO

01:57:49.562 --> 01:57:50.696
COULD TALK TO THE MIDDLE LEVEL

01:57:50.763 --> 01:57:52.198
THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND.

01:57:52.265 --> 01:57:53.833
SO THAT THEY CAN EMBRACE THE

01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:55.201
SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO

01:57:55.268 --> 01:57:57.437
THEM IN THEIR TIME OF CRISIS SO

01:57:57.503 --> 01:57:59.372
WHAT COULD WE DO IS A STATE TO

01:57:59.439 --> 01:58:00.773

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:02.275
MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE FOR

01:58:02.341 --> 01:58:04.710
YOUNGSTERS OR OLDER PEOPLE TO BE

ON THE HEAD WHICH IS.

01:58:22.995 --> 01:58:24.163
A LOT OF THE TIMES THIS ISSUE

01:58:24.230 --> 01:58:26.399
STARTS IN EITHER THE MEDICAL

01:58:26.466 --> 01:58:28.434
OFFICE OR IN THE HOSPITAL WHEN

01:58:28.501 --> 01:58:29.869
PEOPLE ARE WAITING DISCHARGED

01:58:29.936 --> 01:58:30.636
HOME.

01:58:30.703 --> 01:58:33.940
OR WHEN A FAMILY MEMBER IS --

01:58:34.006 --> 01:58:37.376
WITH THEIR ALZHEIMER'S.

01:58:37.443 --> 01:58:40.012

DO TO CARE FOR YOUR MEDICAL

01:58:42.915 --> 01:58:44.317
NEEDS BUT MOST OFTEN THEY DON'T

01:58:44.383 --> 01:58:46.385
REALLY HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE

01:58:46.452 --> 01:58:48.054
LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.422
SOCIAL SERVICE ARENA.

01:58:49.489 --> 01:58:51.424
THAT RIGHT THERE IS A HUGE

01:58:51.491 --> 01:58:53.860
BARRIER TO HELPING PEOPLE ACCESS

01:58:53.926 --> 01:58:54.727
THE INFORMATION AND SUPPORTS

01:58:54.794 --> 01:58:55.628
THEY NEED.

01:58:55.695 --> 01:58:56.762
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ONE

01:58:56.829 --> 01:58:58.798
SOLUTION TO THAT PART YET BUT I

01:58:58.865 --> 01:59:00.132
THINK THAT IT'S THE MORE THAT WE

01:59:00.199 --> 01:59:01.567
CAN WITH RAISE AWARENESS AWARE

01:59:01.634 --> 01:59:03.369
ROUND IT AND START TO ENGAGE THE

01:59:03.436 --> 01:59:04.637
MEDICAL SYSTEM AND HOW TO

01:59:04.704 --> 01:59:06.272
DEVELOP MORE INTEGRATED SERVICE

01:59:06.339 --> 01:59:07.273
DELIVERY SYSTEMS.

01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:08.674

THE COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE

01:59:13.279 --> 01:59:15.114
BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK WE HAVE A

01:59:15.181 --> 01:59:16.115
LONG WAY TO GO.

01:59:16.182 --> 01:59:17.683

SO MANY EXCEPTIONS --

02:02:10.489 --> 02:02:12.224
IT IS THE COMMUNITY BASED ADULT

SERVICES PROGRAM WHICH IS

02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:15.761

TECHNICALLY A STATEWIDE --

02:02:17.763 --> 02:02:19.498
BENEFIT AS PART OF MEDI CAL

STORY SHORT I THINK THAT THERE

02:02:34.513 --> 02:02:37.216
IS A MOVEMENT TOWARDS HAVING

02:02:37.283 --> 02:02:37.917

02:02:37.983 --> 02:02:39.518
L. T. S. AS THE SOCIAL SERVICE

02:02:39.585 --> 02:02:41.287
DELIVERY SYSTEM MORE INTEGRATED

02:02:41.353 --> 02:02:43.289

02:02:43.355 --> 02:02:44.623
SYSTEM BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:46.459
AT ALL AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT

02:02:46.525 --> 02:02:48.627
THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM --

02:02:48.694 --> 02:02:51.063

KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE ACCORDING

02:03:05.311 --> 02:03:06.445
CARE.

02:03:06.512 --> 02:03:07.446
WHERE THEY COME IN AND THEN

02:03:07.513 --> 02:03:09.915
THERE'S A CASE WORKER THEY

02:03:09.982 --> 02:03:11.650
PACKAGE SHE?

02:03:11.717 --> 02:03:14.453
A SAID OF LIKE WHAT WE USED TO

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:16.388
CALL WRAPAROUND RIGHT RIGHT

02:03:16.455 --> 02:03:18.791
RIGHT.

02:03:18.858 --> 02:03:19.925
KNOWN.

02:03:19.992 --> 02:03:21.994
AS WE STARTED DOING NOW THE

02:03:22.061 --> 02:03:22.862
NINETIES YOU KNOW.

02:03:22.928 --> 02:03:26.999
AND THEN AND THEN WE WE PUT --

02:03:27.066 --> 02:03:28.634
THAT SYSTEM TOGETHER COULD BE A

02:03:28.701 --> 02:03:29.869
MULTI DISCIPLINARY SOCIAL

02:03:29.935 --> 02:03:30.870
SERVICE THERE MIGHT BE SOME

02:03:30.936 --> 02:03:33.205
FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM.

02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:34.240
IT BE LIKE A WHOLE PACKAGE FOR

02:03:34.306 --> 02:03:37.276
NOT JUST THE PATIENT THAT'S A

02:03:37.343 --> 02:03:38.711
MEDICAL PATIENT WITH THE FAMILY

02:03:38.778 --> 02:03:39.345
AND MEDICAL.

02:03:39.411 --> 02:03:41.947
THEN WE INVOLVE THE FAMILY

02:03:42.014 --> 02:03:44.150
TOGETHER IN THAT.

02:03:44.216 --> 02:03:45.651
GOING THAT TOGETHER LIKE THE

02:03:45.718 --> 02:03:47.153
FAMILY SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE

02:03:47.219 --> 02:03:48.888
DISCUSSION ABSOLUTELY --

02:03:48.954 --> 02:03:51.023
SO -- IS

02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:52.558
THAT IS THAT KIND OF A SYSTEM

02:03:52.625 --> 02:03:54.293
THAT SHOULD BE STATEWIDE --

02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:55.694
GOSH I THINK IF WE CAN GET A

02:03:55.761 --> 02:03:57.396
TRULY PERSON CENTERED SYSTEM OF

02:03:57.463 --> 02:03:59.031
CARE LIKE THAT THAT LOOKS NOT

02:03:59.098 --> 02:04:01.767
ONLY AT A PERSON'S MEDICAL NEEDS

02:04:01.834 --> 02:04:02.968
BUT THE RANGE OF SOCIAL SERVICE.

02:04:03.035 --> 02:04:04.570
YEAH BECAUSE AS WE KNOW IT'S NOT

02:04:04.637 --> 02:04:05.871
JUST ABOUT HEALTHCARE IT'S NOT

02:04:05.938 --> 02:04:07.506
HOUSING IT'S BUT TRANSPORTATION

02:04:07.573 --> 02:04:09.675
IT'S ABOUT CARE GIVING SUPPORT.

02:04:09.742 --> 02:04:10.810
THE WHOLE RANGE FOOD SOCIAL

02:04:10.876 --> 02:04:12.478
PROGRAM ORAL HEALTH MENTAL

02:04:12.545 --> 02:04:14.280
HEALTH YOU NAME IT --

02:04:14.346 --> 02:04:16.081
IT IN AGAIN THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE

02:04:16.148 --> 02:04:17.416
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE

02:04:17.483 --> 02:04:18.717
COORDINATED CARE INITIATIVE BUT

02:04:18.784 --> 02:04:20.319
I THINK WEARE A WAYS AWAY FROM

02:04:20.386 --> 02:04:21.587
THAT RIGHT NOW FOR A NUMBER OF

02:04:21.654 --> 02:04:22.755
REASONS.

02:04:22.822 --> 02:04:24.356
I ALSO THINK A GOOD MODEL AS

02:04:24.423 --> 02:04:27.493
YOU'RE VERY FOR GET TO THE THE

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:29.495
WHOLE WRAPAROUND IN THE MEDICAL

02:04:29.562 --> 02:04:31.163
SERVICE SIDE IS THE LANHAM ACT

02:04:31.230 --> 02:04:32.865
BECAUSE THE REGIONAL SO I KNOW

02:04:32.932 --> 02:04:34.400
YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT.

02:04:34.466 --> 02:04:35.868
THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IS --

02:04:35.935 --> 02:04:37.303
YOU KNOW FOR OLDER ADULTS AND

02:04:37.369 --> 02:04:38.304
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THERE

02:04:38.370 --> 02:04:39.605
THEY DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM LIKE

02:04:39.672 --> 02:04:41.640
THAT THAT OFFERS THAT INTENSIVE

02:04:41.707 --> 02:04:43.609
CASE MANAGEMENT PLANNING AS AN

02:04:43.676 --> 02:04:45.077
ENTITLEMENT SO I THINK THERE'S A

02:04:45.144 --> 02:04:46.445
LOT TO LEARN FROM.

02:04:46.512 --> 02:04:48.314
THE STRENGTH OF THAT SYSTEM IN

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:50.316
AND HOW CAN WE HELP.

02:04:50.382 --> 02:04:54.153
THE BROADER POPULATION AN ACCESS

02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:55.321
SERVICE YOUR CENTER.

02:04:55.387 --> 02:04:57.122

TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE RIGHT THERE

02:05:04.330 --> 02:05:04.930
STONE I WORK ON THAT

02:05:04.997 --> 02:05:05.231
[inaudible]

02:05:05.297 --> 02:05:08.434
OF I HAD I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT

02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:10.135
INSURANCE COMPANIES --

02:05:10.202 --> 02:05:10.836
PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES

02:05:13.806 --> 02:05:15.140
INSURANCE.

02:05:15.207 --> 02:05:16.909
AND THEY'RE ALSO REQUIRED TO

02:05:16.976 --> 02:05:19.211
OBSERVE OUR STATE LAWS AND IF

02:05:19.278 --> 02:05:20.346

OBSERVERS STATE LAWS.

02:05:22.214 --> 02:05:23.916
AND WE CALL THEM YOU KNOW.

02:05:23.983 --> 02:05:25.184
SOME PEOPLE CALL THOSE LAWS

02:05:25.251 --> 02:05:28.854
MANDATES ARE CALM STATE LAWS.

02:05:28.921 --> 02:05:30.122

IN CALIFORNIA.

02:05:34.059 --> 02:05:36.629
SO ARE THERE LAWS THAT PROTECT

02:05:36.695 --> 02:05:38.664

02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:40.933
CARE OR IS THERE ARE.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:41.667

SUPPORT.

02:05:44.336 --> 02:05:46.505
FROM THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE. TO

02:05:46.572 --> 02:05:48.674
REQUIRE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES

02:05:48.741 --> 02:05:51.310
PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL

02:05:51.377 --> 02:05:53.345
PROVIDE THE CARE I DON'T HAVE

AND ONLY ABOUT 5% WE GET THEIR

02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:32.418
CARE FINANCED BY LONG TERM CARE

02:06:32.484 --> 02:06:34.720
INSURANCE SO THE MODEL HAS BEEN

02:06:34.787 --> 02:06:37.022
PROVEN TO BE VERY FINANCIALLY

02:06:37.089 --> 02:06:38.824
UNSOUND. FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS

KEVIN PRINTABLES THE ONLY PERSON

02:10:42.634 --> 02:10:44.603
ON YOUR PANELS WHO MENTIONED THE

02:10:44.670 --> 02:10:46.138
ISSUE OF ELDER ABUSE.

02:10:46.205 --> 02:10:48.640
AND WHEN USED BEGIN TO LOOK AT

02:10:48.707 --> 02:10:50.909
DATA ON ELDER ABUSE THE LARGEST

02:10:50.976 --> 02:10:52.911
PERCENTAGE OF PERPETRATORS ARE

02:10:52.978 --> 02:10:54.646
FAMILY MEMBERS.

02:10:54.713 --> 02:10:56.114
AND IF YOU'RE PUTTING PEOPLE IN

02:10:56.181 --> 02:10:57.482
SITUATIONS WHERE THEY'RE NOT

02:10:57.549 --> 02:10:58.850
ADEQUATELY TRAINED AND NOT

02:10:58.917 --> 02:11:00.185
PREPARED AND DON'T FEEL LIKE

02:11:00.252 --> 02:11:01.920
THEY HAVE A CHOICE.

02:11:01.987 --> 02:11:03.622
YOU ARE SETTING THEM UP FOR

02:11:03.689 --> 02:11:05.457
FAILURE.

02:11:05.524 --> 02:11:06.959
AND THAT'S REALLY A CRITICAL

02:11:07.025 --> 02:11:09.795
THING TO FOCUS ON TO PROVIDE

02:11:09.861 --> 02:11:10.929
TRAINING.

02:11:10.996 --> 02:11:12.864
AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE CARE GIVERS

02:11:12.931 --> 02:11:16.468
AND THEY GET INTO A SITUATION

02:11:16.535 --> 02:11:17.402
THAT -- IS

02:11:17.469 --> 02:11:19.238
DANGEROUS.

02:11:19.304 --> 02:11:21.073
THE PULL THEM OUT AND TO GIVE

02:11:21.139 --> 02:11:23.275
THEM THE SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED --

02:11:23.342 --> 02:11:24.109
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

02:11:24.176 --> 02:11:25.244
CREATING.

02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:26.511
ELDER ABUSE REGISTRIES AND

02:11:26.578 --> 02:11:29.014
PENALIZING A LOCKING PEOPLE UP.

02:11:29.081 --> 02:11:30.415
BUT WHEN THEY'RE NOT PREPARED TO

02:11:30.482 --> 02:11:32.351
TAKE ON THE JOB THEY REALLY NEED

02:11:32.417 --> 02:11:34.519
THE SUPPORT AND THE HELP TO TURN

02:11:34.586 --> 02:11:35.120
THEM AROUND AND I'VE ACTUALLY

02:11:35.187 --> 02:11:37.222
HEARD ABOUT --

02:11:37.289 --> 02:11:38.624
I THINK IT WAS THE A JUDGE

02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:40.759
INVENTOR OF WHO ACTUALLY HAS

02:11:40.826 --> 02:11:42.527
SENTENCE --

02:11:42.594 --> 02:11:44.396
CARE GIVERS WHO HAVE BEEN OF

02:11:44.463 --> 02:11:46.832
VIOLENT OR ABUSIVE. TO TRAINING.

02:11:46.898 --> 02:11:48.600
SO THAT THEY WILL GET WHAT THEY

02:11:48.667 --> 02:11:50.369
NEED SO THEY CAN.

02:11:50.435 --> 02:11:51.670

APPROPRIATELY AND GET THE CARE

02:11:53.038 --> 02:11:54.673
THAT THEY NEED.

02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:56.375

02:11:56.441 --> 02:11:57.576
INCORPORATE THIS IN ANY.

02:11:57.643 --> 02:11:59.211
THOUGHTS THAT YOU HAVE ON GOING

02:11:59.278 --> 02:12:00.679
IN THAT MAYBE THAT CALIFORNIA

02:12:00.746 --> 02:12:02.047
OLDER JUSTICE COALITION COULD BE

02:12:02.114 --> 02:12:02.981
A PART OF THAT DISCUSSION

02:12:18.263 --> 02:12:19.131
CALIFORNIA.

02:12:19.197 --> 02:12:20.732
AND I WANTED TO COME UP HERE

02:12:20.799 --> 02:12:22.034
REPRESENT --

02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:24.336
MY AGENCY AND MYSELF BECAUSE I

02:12:24.403 --> 02:12:26.204
AM A MILLENNIAL CARE GIVER --

02:12:26.271 --> 02:12:27.939
I'M CARING FOR MY MOTHER WHO WAS

02:12:28.006 --> 02:12:30.809
MOTHER IN LAW WAS AT KNOWS AND

02:12:30.876 --> 02:12:32.411
SHE LIVES WITH US AND PART OF

02:12:32.477 --> 02:12:33.979
THE SANDWICH GENERATION AND

02:12:34.046 --> 02:12:35.881
CARING FOR A FIVE MONTH OLD.

02:12:35.947 --> 02:12:38.950
AND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT --

02:12:39.017 --> 02:12:40.519
SENATOR PAN AND CENTER JACKSON

02:12:40.585 --> 02:12:42.454
HAD ASKED WERE SOLUTIONS HOW CAN

02:12:42.521 --> 02:12:44.356
WE FIND SOLUTIONS AND AS A

02:12:44.423 --> 02:12:45.424
PROGRAM MANAGER.

02:12:45.490 --> 02:12:48.193
I SEE A LOT OF GAPS --

02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:49.728
ONE OF THEM IS THE FACT THAT WE

02:12:49.795 --> 02:12:51.530
DON'T HAVE WHAT WE'RE TALKING

02:12:51.596 --> 02:12:52.964
ABOUT TRYING TO FIND A ONE WAY

02:12:53.031 --> 02:12:56.635
SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY A NETWORK OF

02:12:56.702 --> 02:12:57.035
REFERRALS.

02:12:57.102 --> 02:12:58.136
MAYBE THAT.

02:12:58.203 --> 02:13:00.339
EVERYBODY CAN POINT TOWARDS AND

02:13:00.405 --> 02:13:01.373
THAT WE CAN --

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:03.008
REFER TO OTHER DIFFERENT

02:13:03.075 --> 02:13:04.910
AGENCIES RIGHT NOW IT'S A VERY

02:13:04.976 --> 02:13:06.678
FRAGMENTED SYSTEM AND WHAT I SEE

02:13:06.745 --> 02:13:09.181
IS WORKING FROM THE MEDICAL

02:13:09.247 --> 02:13:12.284
PERSPECTIVE IS WE SEE --

02:13:12.351 --> 02:13:14.419
THE PILOT SYSTEMS WHERE --

02:13:14.486 --> 02:13:16.188
NAVIGATORS ARE SENDING REFERRALS

02:13:16.254 --> 02:13:18.824
OVER TO US AND WE THEN ARE ABLE

02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:20.325
TO CATCH THESE.

02:13:20.392 --> 02:13:22.160
EARLY ARE CARE GIVERS --

02:13:22.227 --> 02:13:25.997
WITH EARLY ONSET OF MALE COTTON

02:13:26.064 --> 02:13:28.400
AS WE GET THOSE ARE CARE GIVERS

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:29.868
AND REYES ABLE TO EDUCATE THEM.

02:13:29.935 --> 02:13:32.104
BUT THE PROBLEM THAT WE ALSO SEE

02:13:32.170 --> 02:13:33.772
IS THAT THERE'S A BIG GAP WITH

02:13:33.839 --> 02:13:36.241
MILLENNIAL CARE GIVERS --

02:13:36.308 --> 02:13:39.745
MOST OF OUR CLIENTS ARE OLDER

02:13:39.811 --> 02:13:42.347
CARE GIVER SPOUSAL CAREGIVERS --

02:13:42.414 --> 02:13:43.582
WE HAVE --

02:13:43.648 --> 02:13:45.050
CARE GIVERS WHO ARE CHILDREN BUT

02:13:45.117 --> 02:13:47.152
THEY DON'T COME TO A LOT OF OUR

02:13:47.219 --> 02:13:48.220
SUPPORT GROUP THEY DON'T COME TO

02:13:48.286 --> 02:13:49.421
OUR EDUCATION AND TRAINING

02:13:49.488 --> 02:13:51.690
CLASSES EVEN THOUGH IT'S FREE --

02:13:51.757 --> 02:13:53.191
BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY --

02:13:53.258 --> 02:13:54.526
WE ARE NOT TALKING THE SAME

02:13:54.593 --> 02:13:56.194
PLATFORM THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING

02:13:56.261 --> 02:13:57.662
INFORMATION FROM --

02:13:57.729 --> 02:13:59.398
AS A MILLENNIAL CARE GIVER I GO

02:13:59.464 --> 02:14:01.466
TO FACEBOOK I GO TO THE

02:14:01.533 --> 02:14:03.535
PLATFORMS AND THERE ARE JUST NOT

02:14:03.602 --> 02:14:05.303
ENOUGH PLATFORMS.

02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:06.938
ARE CURRENTLY WITHIN OUR OUR

02:14:07.005 --> 02:14:09.908
SYSTEM R. E. SYSTEM TO BE ABLE

02:14:09.975 --> 02:14:11.209
TO CATER TO THE WAY THAT THEY

02:14:11.276 --> 02:14:12.644
NEED INFORMATION.

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:15.080
AND I THINK PART OF THE ISSUE IS

02:14:15.147 --> 02:14:15.781
THAT THEY DON'T AYE DIFFERENT

02:14:15.847 --> 02:14:18.917
IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS A CARE

02:14:18.984 --> 02:14:19.117
GIVER.

02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:20.786
AND I KNOW THAT.

02:14:20.852 --> 02:14:22.788
IN AUSTRALIA THEY DID A

02:14:22.854 --> 02:14:23.989
NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN WITH

02:14:24.055 --> 02:14:25.991
ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION WHERE

02:14:26.057 --> 02:14:29.728
THEY HIRED A CELEBRITY WHO WAS

02:14:29.795 --> 02:14:31.696
ALSO A CARE GIVER --

02:14:31.763 --> 02:14:33.765
AND HE WAS YOUNGER AND HE TALKED

02:14:33.832 --> 02:14:34.833
ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE AND IS A

02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:36.802
NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGN AND IT

02:14:36.868 --> 02:14:38.537
BROADENED THE AWARENESS AND IT

02:14:38.603 --> 02:14:39.704
WAS AN INITIATIVE.

02:14:39.771 --> 02:14:40.772
BY YOU KNOW AUSTRALIA AND

02:14:40.839 --> 02:14:43.675
ALZHEIMER'S IS A SO I THINK THAT

02:14:43.742 --> 02:14:45.844
WE NEED TO LOOK AT A PREVENTIVE.

02:14:45.911 --> 02:14:47.712
STANDPOINT AND WE ALSO NEED TO

02:14:47.779 --> 02:14:49.147
LOOK AT IT AS YOU KNOW

02:14:49.214 --> 02:14:51.183
INTEGRATING NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO

02:14:51.249 --> 02:14:52.918
REACH A YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC

02:14:52.984 --> 02:14:55.954
BECAUSE THEY WE ARE THE ONES

02:14:56.021 --> 02:14:57.489
THAT ARE GOING TO BE CONTINUING

02:14:57.556 --> 02:14:59.057
TO PROVIDE CARE. FOR FAMILY

02:14:59.124 --> 02:15:02.327
MEMBERS SO OUR AGENCY IS ASKING

02:15:02.394 --> 02:15:04.196
FOR A TEN MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING

02:15:04.262 --> 02:15:05.430
FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO HELP

02:15:05.497 --> 02:15:07.399
US READ REVAMPS RETOOL OUR

02:15:07.466 --> 02:15:08.366
PLATFORM.

02:15:08.433 --> 02:15:10.869
SO THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW PROVIDE

02:15:10.936 --> 02:15:12.737
ALL THE DIFFERENT NEW SYSTEMS TO

02:15:12.804 --> 02:15:14.005
INTEGRATE YOU KNOW --

02:15:14.072 --> 02:15:15.340
EDUCATION THROUGH MULTI

02:15:15.407 --> 02:15:17.142
LANGUAGES ACROSS ALL THE

02:15:17.209 --> 02:15:19.110
DIFFERENT AGENCIES I ALSO THINK

02:15:19.177 --> 02:15:21.046
THAT PROFESSIONAL AN INFORMAL

02:15:21.112 --> 02:15:22.681
FAMILY CAREGIVERS SHOULD BE

02:15:22.747 --> 02:15:24.783
REIMBURSED IN SOME WAY --

02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:26.985
RIGHT NOW I JUST US THEY'D BE

02:15:27.052 --> 02:15:28.587
THERE IS A LACK OF PROVIDERS

02:15:28.653 --> 02:15:30.355
BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET PAID.

02:15:30.422 --> 02:15:32.624
HARDLY ANYTHING --

02:15:32.691 --> 02:15:34.059
A SO WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO GO

02:15:34.125 --> 02:15:35.660
AND PROVIDE CARE GIVING WHEN

02:15:35.727 --> 02:15:37.095
THEY COULD GO TO STARBUCKS AND

02:15:37.162 --> 02:15:39.331
MAKE SIXTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR.

02:15:39.397 --> 02:15:40.565
AND THEY'RE GONNA GET BETTER

02:15:40.632 --> 02:15:42.868
BENEFITS AND CARE GIVING IS A

02:15:42.934 --> 02:15:44.169
HARD JOB.

02:15:44.236 --> 02:15:45.704
SO WE NEED TO SOMEHOW REIMBURSE

02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:47.272
THEM -- WE

02:15:47.339 --> 02:15:48.573
ALSO NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT MEDI

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.642
CAL MEDICARE AND THE FUNDING OF

02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:52.310
LONG TERM CARE PLACEMENT.

02:15:52.377 --> 02:15:53.612
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A GAP IT'S

02:15:53.678 --> 02:15:57.649

SO THAT YOU CAN GET LONG TERM

02:16:03.555 --> 02:16:05.657
CARE AND THE SOLUTION THERE'S

02:16:07.025 --> 02:16:10.262
SOLUTION IS BUT IT'S NOT THERE --
