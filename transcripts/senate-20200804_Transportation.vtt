THAT I BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT I

00:34:21.125 --> 00:34:25.696
THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE

00:34:25.763 --> 00:34:26.297
NEED MORE ELECTRIC FIELD. THAT

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:27.498
THE CHARTER. TWENTY TO BE

00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:30.001
INNOVATIVE THAT. WHICH IS THE

00:34:30.067 --> 00:34:31.969
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS

00:34:32.036 --> 00:34:34.639
WORKS- I KNOW THAT CENTER

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:36.073
STATED THAT THIS IS BEEN IN

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:37.942
FRANCE SINCE EARLY THIS YEAR

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:40.611
BUT TO BE FAIR WE HAVEN'T BEEN

00:34:40.678 --> 00:34:42.313
HERE ALL YOUR PACK AND I WAS

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.015
UNDER THE IMPRESSION. BEFORE I

00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:47.485
DID ANY EVENT YOU KNOW TAKE A

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:48.786
LOOK AND I KNOW THAT IT WAS

00:34:48.853 --> 00:34:51.522
JUST GUIDED IN AMENDED THE

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:53.724
ASSEMBLY TWO WEEKS AGO. AND

00:34:53.791 --> 00:34:55.159
WHAT I BELIEVE IS THIS IS ONE

00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:57.762
OF THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE

00:34:57.829 --> 00:35:00.331
IMPORTANT BUT IT ALSO NEEDS. TO

00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:02.066
BRING. POLICY AND THERE AND I

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:03.668
CONSIDER TO BE ONE OF THOSE

00:35:03.734 --> 00:35:04.802
STAKEHOLDERS AND I THINK THAT

00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:05.870
WE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF WE%

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:08.906

00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:10.408
ALL RIGHT NOW I'M STRUGGLING TO

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:11.609
EVEN UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:13.377
BETWEEN SUBSCRIPTION MODEL

00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:15.213

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:17.048
SOME DEALERS HAVE AT Y. EIGHT.

00:35:17.114 --> 00:35:20.718
OTHERS AND- I ALSO BELIEVE THAT

00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:22.153
IF WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW ALL THE

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.055
ELECTRIC VEHICLE COME TO DO

00:35:24.121 --> 00:35:28.426

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:30.027
CAR DEALERSHIPS. SOMETHING I

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:31.529
REALLY- IMPORTANT THAT I

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:34.232
BELIEVE THE PRESENTER BUT RIGHT

00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:37.869

GOOD AMOUNT OF DETAIL ON THE

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:14.719
UNFAIRLY COMPETE WITH OUR CAR

00:39:14.785 --> 00:39:16.787
DEALERSHIPS BECAUSE THEY WOULD

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:18.222
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:20.191
PARTICIPATE IN SOMETHING LIKE

00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:22.560
THIS IF THEY CHOOSE AND

00:39:22.626 --> 00:39:27.565
CERTAINLY COULD THAT IF THE ARM

00:39:27.631 --> 00:39:28.766
IF ART THING STATUTES IN ANY

00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:31.535
WAY RESTRICT THEY CHOSE NOT TO

00:39:31.602 --> 00:39:33.370
BE PART OF THIS WE CAN ADDRESS

00:39:33.437 --> 00:39:36.373
THAT. I AM IN A SUPPORT THE

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.542
BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK THAT

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:41.512
THIS TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT I MEAN

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:44.615
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT CAR SHARE

00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:46.784
AND THAT WHEN I IN MY FORMER

00:39:46.851 --> 00:39:48.686
PRIOR BEING LEGISLATURE AND I

00:39:48.753 --> 00:39:50.955
RAN IT ORGANIZATION THAT RAN

00:39:51.021 --> 00:39:51.989
THE PROGRAM CITIES FOR CLIMATE

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:55.259
PROTECTION WE WERE ABLE TO

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:59.363
PROVIDE GRANTS TO. LOCAL FOR

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.598
INNOVATIVE PROJECTS TO BRING

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:02.566
DOWN TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:04.635
AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. IN

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:06.670
THE EARLY NINETIES WE PROVIDED

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:08.606
THE VERY FIRST FUNDING TO THE

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:10.241
FIRST TWO CITIES THAT EVER GET

00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:12.009
HARSHER PROGRAMS WHICH WERE

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.711
SANTA MONICA IN PORTLAND. THIS

00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:15.746
AGAIN WAS IN THE EARLY NINETIES.

00:40:15.813 --> 00:40:17.848
THEY WERE UNABLE TO EXPAND

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:20.851
THEIR PARSER PROGRAMS. LET JUST

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:22.853
US STATUTES IN ALMOST EVERY

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.790
STATE PROHIBITED PARK HERE IN

00:40:25.856 --> 00:40:29.560
TOOK YEARS TO FIX THE STATUTES.

00:40:29.627 --> 00:40:31.095
AND YET WE NOW APPRECIATE AND

00:40:31.162 --> 00:40:33.097
UNDERSTAND THE VERY IMPORTANT

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:35.933
ROLE FOR OUR SHARE YOU AT FOR

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.668
THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WISH TO

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:40.304
ONLY FAR NOW IN THIS CASE WE

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:44.241
HAVE AS CALIFORNIA. AND VICIOUS

00:40:44.308 --> 00:40:45.276
SCHOOLS. TRANSPORTATION

00:40:45.342 --> 00:40:47.344
EMISSIONS REDUCTION AND FOR

00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:49.246
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ZERO

00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:50.848
EMISSION VEHICLES ON THE ROAD.

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:53.450
AND YET WE KNOW THAT MANY

00:40:53.517 --> 00:40:56.687
PEOPLE MANY OF US WE BUY A NEW

00:40:56.754 --> 00:40:59.824
CAR INFREQUENTLY. AND SO TO

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.626
TAKE THE TO MAKE THE LEAP OF

00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:03.961
FAITH TO BUY A VERY NEW

00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:09.366
TECHNOLOGY. IS OUR IS DIFFICULT

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:10.334
FOR MANY PEOPLE AND SO DO YOU.

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:12.770
TO BE ABLE TO GET CONCORD USING

00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:17.508
A NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR TWO MONTHS

00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:20.010
THREE MONTHS SIX MONTHS BEFORE

00:41:20.077 --> 00:41:21.278
WHEN. YEAH THINK IS A REALLY

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:24.481
GOOD SERVICE THAT PROVIDES AN

00:41:24.548 --> 00:41:27.251
WOULD HELP US. ON CALIFORNIA'S

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:29.086
NOWHERE NEAR EATING ITS GOALS

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:31.021
OF. ARTS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES

00:41:31.088 --> 00:41:34.358
THAT WERE ONE OF THE ROADS FOR

00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:34.925
OUR TRANSPORTATION EMISSION

00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:37.628
REDUCTION. SO I THINK THAT THIS

00:41:37.695 --> 00:41:40.931
IS ONE OF THOSE INNOVATIONS

00:41:40.998 --> 00:41:44.101
THAT. I NEEDED AND I THINK THAT.

00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:46.604
I DO NOT SEE IT AS THE TYPE OF

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:47.838
THREAT THAT OUR CAR DEALERSHIPS

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:50.841
CURRENTLY SEE BUT CERTAINLY WE

00:41:50.908 --> 00:41:51.475
HAVE THE ABILITY AS THE

00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:53.577
LEGISLATURE. THERE ARE

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:55.279
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO

00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:57.448
ADJUST OUR STATUTES IN THE

00:41:57.514 --> 00:41:58.649
FUTURE THAT I WILL BE

00:41:58.716 --> 00:42:01.318
SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU

THE GOOD SENATOR FROM FREMONT

00:42:10.928 --> 00:42:14.965

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:33.651
YOUR VERY STREET. COMMENTS CAR

00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:34.919
DEALERS RIGHT NOW HAVE THE

ABILITY TO DO SUBSCRIPTION

00:42:36.453 --> 00:42:39.123
SERVICES. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:41.292
THIS IS JUST A CASE WHERE WE

00:42:41.358 --> 00:42:42.927
HAVE A COMPETITOR THE DOESN'T

00:42:42.993 --> 00:42:45.362
WANT TO SEE SOMEBODY ELSE ORDER

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:47.231
ORGANIZATION OF COMPETITORS

00:42:47.298 --> 00:42:48.699
THAT DOESN'T WANT TO SEE NEW

00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:51.268
INNOVATION LIKE THIS HAPPENED

00:42:51.335 --> 00:42:53.070
AND GET THEM INTO THE MARKET.

00:42:53.137 --> 00:42:55.439
SO THEY'VE GOT SO MUCH TIME

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:56.473
THEY CAN EITHER GET WITH THE

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.975
PROGRAM TO GET THE SAME THING

00:42:58.042 --> 00:42:59.476
OR I THINK WE SHOULD I THINK WE

00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:01.078
SHOULD THIS TODAY THIS BILL OUT

00:43:01.145 --> 00:43:04.548

RUBIO REGARDING THE MANNER IN

00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:12.990
WHICH IS COME FORWARD AND- THE

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:15.559
PROBLEM OF REALLY HAVING AN

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:17.061
OPPORTUNITY TO DIG INTO THE

00:43:17.127 --> 00:43:19.697
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES BETWEEN OUR

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:21.765
SHIP IN THE MANUFACTURE OF

00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:23.467
CURRENTLY THAT WOULD AS I WOULD

00:43:23.534 --> 00:43:25.903
ASSUME IN IT'S JUST A QUESTION

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:26.637
PERHAPS A STATEMENT AND A

00:43:26.704 --> 00:43:28.772
QUESTION NOT UNDERSTANDING OF

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:31.241
FLAT FEE FOR BOARD CHOSE TO

00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:37.748
AND GO ALL ELECTRIC VEHICLE

00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:42.152
THEY WOULD BE KLAY. BE FACTURE

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:44.054
WHO COULD HAVE. THERE SHIPS

00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:46.724
DOWN TO OF VEHICLES IN A VERY

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.559
SHORT TIME TO BE ABLE TO

00:43:48.625 --> 00:43:53.364
COMPETE WITH CANOE. WHO ARE

00:43:54.965 --> 00:43:58.869
OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE THERE ARE

00:43:58.936 --> 00:43:59.870
INNOVATIVE AND I THINK IT'S

00:43:59.937 --> 00:44:01.972
GREAT IDEA BUT I THINK WE'VE

00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:04.174
SET UP A SITUATION. OF

00:44:04.241 --> 00:44:06.310
COMPETING AND A LITTLE THING

00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:09.546
TEND DEALERSHIPS. ARM THAT'S

00:44:09.613 --> 00:44:10.347
THE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF

00:44:10.414 --> 00:44:12.583
CONSUMERS WHO CAN AND IS THIS

00:44:12.649 --> 00:44:15.519

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.003
A CANOE CAR IS THERE. FOR OVER

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:36.907
A CHEVY MALL. FIVE I THINK IT

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:38.075
IT'S FULL COMP NOW TO HOW THOSE

00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:41.078
TWO THINGS OPERATE.

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:44.515
CONCURRENTLY AN ANTI AND- I

00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:46.250
GUESS. PARTNERSHIP VANS

00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:48.419
COMPARED TO THE WAY IT DOES NOW

00:44:48.485 --> 00:44:50.320
AND I THINK IF WE HAD MORE TIME

00:44:50.387 --> 00:44:53.023
IN OF THE STAKEHOLDER ARE

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:55.092
MEETING FETTY FASHION ALPHA

00:44:55.159 --> 00:44:58.262
JUST SAID BY SENATOR- RUBIO

00:44:58.328 --> 00:44:59.696
WE'D UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT

00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:01.131
BETTER AND PERHAPS IT WOUL BE

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:03.267
MORE RECEPTIVE. ON THE PART OF

00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:05.402
OUR DEALERSHIPS IN OUR EXISTING

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:08.338
OUR MANUFACTURE DEALERSHIP

00:45:08.405 --> 00:45:11.508
RELATIONSHIP. KIND OF A MULTI

00:45:11.575 --> 00:45:13.610
PHASE STATEMENT IN QUESTION BUT

00:45:13.677 --> 00:45:15.612
CLARITY ON THAT POINT IS I

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:17.448
THINK EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR

00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:19.149
THOSE OF US. DECIDING HOW WE'RE

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:20.517
GOING TO VOTE BUT MOST

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:23.253
IMPORTANTLY TO OUR- THE WAY WE

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.421
CURRENTLY UNDERSTAND THE

00:45:24.488 --> 00:45:27.825
AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURING ON OUR

00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:30.394
DEALERSHIP SALE A RELATIONSHIP

00:45:30.461 --> 00:45:33.163
YEAH. YOU KNOW I'VE I THINK.

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:34.531
THROUGH THE CHAIR THE GOOD THE

00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:36.533
GOOD SENATOR CAN APPRECIATE THE

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.336
FACT THAT PART OF WHAT MAKES.

00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:41.939
PROCESS DIFFICULT IS I TO A

00:45:42.005 --> 00:45:43.474
GROUP OF FOLKS TO RUN THE

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.776
SYSTEM NOW AND THEY DON'T WANT

00:45:45.843 --> 00:45:46.743
TO SEE ANY CHANGES IN THIS

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:54.918
AREA- AND SO I THINK THEY'RE.

00:45:54.985 --> 00:45:55.519
THEY'RE GENERAL TAKE HIS BAND

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:56.120
WOULD LIKE JUST STOP THE BILL

00:45:56.186 --> 00:45:57.154
RIGHT AS A TO ENGAGE. IN REAL

00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:58.689
CALM OF HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

00:45:58.755 --> 00:46:01.592
MAKE MODEL WITH THIS SO THAT'S

00:46:01.658 --> 00:46:03.227
BEEN A CHALLENGE I MEAN I GUESS

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:05.095
I THINK FROM RTG IN MY

00:46:05.162 --> 00:46:07.698
PERSPECTIVE IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:08.899
TO JUST TRY TO UNILATERALLY

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:10.000
IMPOSE A MODEL THAT WOULD

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:11.735
INCLUDE THEM WITHOUT INCLUDING

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:13.370
THEM IN THE DISCUSSION BUT IF

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:15.472
THEY WANT TO PURCHASE

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:16.306
DISCUSSION BECAUSE THE THEY

00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:20.177
WANT. THAT ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:21.812
BUT FOR OUR FROM IN

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:23.213
PERSPECTIVES PART OF WHAT WE'RE

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.749
TRYING TO DO HERE IS FORCE THEM

00:46:25.816 --> 00:46:26.650
TO THE TABLE SO WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:46:26.717 --> 00:46:28.318
HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:31.021
TO INCLUDE THEM INTO THE INTO

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:32.990
THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL- AND

00:46:33.056 --> 00:46:36.527
I THAT'S IT THAT'S- I THINK

00:46:36.593 --> 00:46:37.161
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. I THINK

00:46:37.227 --> 00:46:37.794
CAN INCREASE BECAUSE YOU'VE ALL

00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:39.196
HAD DIFFICULT BILLS. BILLS THAT

00:46:39.263 --> 00:46:40.998
IF YOU TRY TO CHANGE PARADIGMS

00:46:41.064 --> 00:46:42.833
AND YOU NEED TO. FORCE PEOPLE

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.068
TO THE CONVERSATION AND THAT'S-

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:45.636
EFFECTIVELY WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:51.041
HERE- WE ARE ABSOLUTELY OPEN.

00:46:51.108 --> 00:46:51.642
TO TALKING ABOUT A MODEL WHERE

00:46:51.708 --> 00:46:53.577
MY FORD. COULD SELL IT YOU

00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:54.044
COULD COULD COULD HAVE

00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:56.580
MEMBERSHIP. FIVE IDEALLY WE

00:46:56.647 --> 00:46:57.681
WOULD BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN WITH

00:46:57.748 --> 00:46:59.516
FORD AND WORKED OUT WITH THEM

00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:00.150
WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE AND

00:47:00.217 --> 00:47:00.717
HOW THEY WOULD FIT INTO THIS

00:47:00.784 --> 00:47:02.886
MODEL. SO THAT'S MY HOPE THAT

00:47:02.953 --> 00:47:06.089
WE'LL BE ABLE TO. YOU KNOW WITH

00:47:06.156 --> 00:47:06.690
HIS BILL MOST FOR IT WILL BE
