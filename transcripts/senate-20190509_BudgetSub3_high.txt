YES NEAR I MEAN THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL INTO AND THE COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEMS -- STARTING WITH -- PILOTS THAT ROLLED IN ON JULY FIRST I'M HEALTH CLINICS IMITATE HAS ACTUALLY BEEN THE LONGEST RUNNING FOR SEVERAL YEARS -- AND THEN WE ADDED THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH WHICH IS SANTA CRUZ MONTEREY MERCED COUNTY. AND SEND CAL HEALTH -- SAN LUIS OBISPO AND SANTA BARBARA -- BACK LAST JULY -- ON JANUARY FIRST WE IMPLEMENTED -- THAT COUNTIES AND PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN SERVICE AREA WHICH ARE DEL NORD HUMBOLDT. LAKE LASSEN MORAN MENDOCINO MODOC NAPA SHASTA SISKIYOU SOLANO CINEMA TRINITY IN YELLOW. AND THEN LASTLY -- ORANGE COUNTY HAD BEEN SLATED TO GO LIVE ON JANUARY FIRST WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS AROUND SOME OF THEIR PROVIDER. NETWORK -- CAPACITY ANDSO WE RESCHEDULED THEM AND PUSH THEM TO JULY FIRST WE HAVE SENSE -- UNDERGONE A LITTLE BIT MORE AND ANALYSIS OF THEIR NETWORK AND THEIR VARIOUS DELEGATED MODELS AND THEY WILL BE GOING. LIVE JULY FIRST THE NOTICES OF ARE IN THE PROCESS OF GOING OUT TO BENEFICIARIES IN THAT AREA -- WHEN WE DID THE HEALTH PLAN READY NESTS FOR THE COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEMS -- PRIOR TO HAVING CHILDREN BE ENROLLED -- FOR THE FULL SCOPE OF SERVICES NOT ONLY FOR CCS SERVICES BUT ALSO FOR THEIR OTHER. CARE NEEDS -- WE DID A PRETTY THOROUGH JOB IN TERMS OF SUBMISSION OF DELIVERABLES FROM THE PLANS -- THIS WAS NOT ONLY FOR NETWORKS BUT ALSO FOR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THERE WERE A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX DELIVERABLES THAT WE REVIEWED AND APPROVED THROUGHOUT THE PHASES OF THE IMPLEMENTATION -- THERE HAVE BEEN REVISED MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING THAT HAVE BEEN DONE BETWEEN THE PLANTS IN THE COUNTIES -- AND THEN WE HAVE -- MADE PLANS GO BACK AND CHANGE SOME OF THEIR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE TO BETTER REFLECT SOME OF THE NEEDS AND THE UNIQUE FEATURES OF HAVING THIS POPULATION ENROLLED IN THE PLAN -- WHEN WE DID THE NETWORK ADEQUACY -- THE PLANS HAD TO MEET THE SAME NETWORK ADEQUACY AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS -- AND HAD TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE CCS PANEL PROVIDERS WITHIN THAT NETWORK -- THOSE WERE ALL CERTIFIED BACK IN JULY -- FOR ORANGE COUNTY WE NOT ONLY -- CERTIFIED THEIR NETWORK AS A PLAN BUT WE ALSO -- LOOKED AT THEIR THIRTEEN DELEGATED THIRTEEN DELEGATED -- MODEL NETWORKS AND HELP THEM TO THE SAME CRITERIA AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND SO THAT WAS WHAT MADE US. FEEL -- FAMILIAR ARE FAMILIAR TO FEEL COMFORTABLE GOING FORWARD WITH THE JULY ONE DATE WITH ORANGE COUNTY BECAUSE OF KIND OF THE DIFFERENT -- ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE IS A PLAN -- WE HAVE DONE CONTRACT AMENDMENTS -- RATES HAVE BEEN DONE -- WITH THE PLANS -- THOSE ARE PENDING -- CMS APPROVAL WE HAVE DONE -- ELEVEN FIFTEEN TECHNICAL WAIVER AMENDMENTS TO REFLECT THE PROGRAM AND THE COUNTIES IN WHICH THE WHOLE TOP MODEL IS. IS LIVE -- SINCE ORANGE COUNTY IS THE LAST COUNTY THAT IS GOING LIFE ON JULY FIRST -- WE HAVE APPROVED A THIRTY DAY CALL CAMPAIGN -- FOR THE PLAN TO BE REACHING OUT TO BENEFICIARIES AND FAMILIES STARTING BETWEEN MAY TENTH AND MAY THIRTY FIRST -- BUT THE NINETY AND SIXTY DAY NOTICES HAVE ALREADY BEEN MAILED -- AS YOU NOTED THE AGENDA -- WE ARE GOING TO BE CONTRACTING WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO TO CONDUCT AN EVALUATION -- IT'S SLATED TO START -- IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND HAS A DUE DATE OF JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE HAD SHARED THIS EVALUATION PLAN WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS WE HAD DISCUSSED IT AT THE CCS ADVISORY GROUP WHICH WAS LAST MONTH -- AND WE HAVE RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM A VARIETY AS INDIVIDUALS AND SO WE'RE CONSOLIDATING AND REVIEWING THAT NOW -- WE HAD A WRONG DEADLINE -- WHEN WE SHARED THE EVALUATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS -- LAST MONTH AT THE CCS ADVISORY GROUP SO WE HAVE REFLECTED THAT THE MODEL OR THE EVALUATION WILL BE DONE THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE IN WHICH EVERYTHING IS FULLY UP OF OPERATIONAL SO THAT AGAIN IS JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO I THINK THAT -- SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WE RECEIVED ROM STAKEHOLDERS -- REFLECTED IN INTEREST IN HAVING ADDITIONAL -- ITEMS SUCH AS DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT PHARMACY HOME HEALTH SERVICES -- SO WE'RE LOOKING TO TALK WITH YOU CASF ABOUT THE INCLUSION OF THOSE -- SPEAKING TO CASE MANAGEMENT I KNOW THAT THERE IS AN INDICATION AND THE AGENDA THAT THERE WERE CONCERNS RAISED TO THE COMMITTEE AROUND BOTH CASE MANAGEMENT -- TRANSPORTATION ELIGIBILITY AND WE HAVE TO JUST BE HONEST IS THAT THE FIRST TIME WE HEARD IT SO I'M YOUR AGENT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THAT'S BEEN RAISED TO US SO. WE'RE HAPPY TO HEAR FROM THE PANEL TODAY WHAT THOSE CONCERNS ARE BUT LIKE I SAID WHEN WE HAD A CCS ADVISORY GROUP MEETING -- LAST MONTH THOSE WERE NOT -- RAISED HIS ITEMS BUT CERTAINLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE -- AROUND ELIGIBILITY LAPSES -- SO CHILDREN IN CCS HAVE BOTH MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY THAT IS DONE BY THE COUNTY AND THE COUNTY RETAINS THAT MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION AND AND SOME OF THE REASONS FOR THAT -- FOR US IS THE PLANS ARE PAID A DIFFERENT RATE -- FOR CCS ELIGIBLE CHILD BASED ON THEIR CCS SELLABLE CONDITION AND WE WANTED THE COUNTY SO KIND OF RETAIN THAT -- SAFETY MECHANISM IF YOU WILL I'M JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEONE WAS CONFIRMING THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAD A CCS CONDITION WHICH MADE THEM INTO A DIFFERENT RATE STRUCTURE -- I KNOW THAT -- THERE'S ALSO MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY SO FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CHILDREN THAT ARE IN. CCS ALSO HAVE MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ELIGIBILITY IS BEING DONE AND SO BOTH OF THOSE -- ARE AT THE AT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNTIES AND SO UNLESS OF COURSE THEY'RE DEPENDENT COUNTY -- BUT THAT'S A SMALL POPULATION OF COUNTIES THAT WE DO THE MEDICAL DETERMINATIONS FOR SO -- IF IT'S A MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY ISSUE OBVIOUSLY MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY CONTINUES TO BE HANDLED BY THE COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT. IF IT'S A MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY NOT MEDI CAL BUT MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY ALSO STILL RETAINED BY THE BY THE COUNTY MEDICAL DIRECTOR IN THE CCS PROGRAM -- TRANSPORTATION -- HAS BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR US -- WE DIRECTED THE PLANS -- LAST YEAR TWO YEARS TIME FLIES -- TWO YEARS AGO -- THAT THEY HAD TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION TO THEIR ENROLLED BENEFICIARIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE SERVICE THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING. WAS WITHIN THE PLANTS FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY SO IN SOME CASES IF A HEALTH PLAN A CEMETERY -- MEMBER IS NEEDING TRANSPORTATION TO A DENTAL APPOINTMENT EVEN THOUGH SAN MATTEO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE -- ARE AUTHORIZING THE DENTAL APPOINTMENT THEY DO RETAIN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TRANSPORTATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT APPOINTMENT. AND THAT HAS BEEN -- AS WE HAVE HEARD -- BOTH THE RAPIDLY INCREASING AND A WELL USED BENEFIT AND I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE IMPORTANCE AND UNDERSERVED ME THAT BENEFICIARIES WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY AND GETTING -- TRANSPORTATION AND RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION TO APPOINTMENTS AND SO THAT IS CERTAINLY CONTINGENT -- YOU KNOW ON MAKING SURE THAT CCS CHILDREN IN THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL ARE ALSO AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE GETTING TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATELY SO TO THE APPOINTMENTS THAT THEY NEED FOR CCS RELATED SERVICES -- WITH THAT I AM HAPPY -- TO STOP AND AND EITHER TAKE QUESTIONS ARE REACT ONCE THE PANELISTS IS DONE WITH THEIR COMMENTS. OKAY SO I THINK WE'LL DO IS WE'LL DO THE PANEL NO OF LA -- COMMENT FINANCE AND THEN WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS SO -- WE WON'T BE A MOVE ON TO SOLD IN. THANK YOU AND SO I'M GONNA I KNOW YOU SEE OF THE AGENCY MORE TIME BUT WE CAN TRY TO KEEP YOUR REMARKS TO THREE MINUTES APPRECIATED. I'LL TRY -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO A TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY -- AS JENNIFER SAID WE ARE THE LONGEST WE'VE HAD THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL FOR SOME TIME -- I'M HERE BECAUSE IN MY COLLEAGUES COULD MAKE IT THIS MORNING SO I DID TALK TO ALL OF THEM AND COLLECTED SOME INFORMATION FROM THEM AND HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION IS GOING. I DO WANT TO JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW REMIND EVERYBODY UP. YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHY WE WHY LEAST WHY THE HELL PLANET SAN MATTEO WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN THOSE MODELS BECAUSE BEFORE. YOU KNOW THEY WERE SILENT CCS SERVICES AND SILENT PLAN SERVICES AND WE FOUND THAT PEOPLE WERE CONFUSED -- WE DID FOCUS GROUPS BEFORE WE STARTED AND PEOPLE TO KNOW WHO TO CALL. AND THEY ALSO -- THEIR PROBLEMS AT THE CCS NURSES COULDN'T REALLY ADDRESS SO LIKE A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT CAME UP FOR WITH PHARMACY IN RESPONSE THE PHARMACY. SO -- WE WE REALLY WANTED TO HAVE A HOLISTIC APPROACH WITH CARE COORDINATION AUTHORIZATIONS -- PHARMACY ALL THE SERVICES TOGETHER AND WE THINK IT LEADS TO A BETTER EXPERIENCE FOR THE CCS BENEFICIARIES. ARM. SO SOME JUST A REAL QUICKLY A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF LOCAL PROBLEMS WERE ABLE TO SOLVE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE CCS UNDER OUR UMBRELLA -- I MENTION PHARMACY SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DID WAS WE SET UP A SPECIALIZED CCS FORMULA. SO THAT THE POLICY HAS MEMBERS DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS THAT MANY AYBE THE GENERAL MEDI CAL POPULATION OUSTED. THIS IS BEFORE BEFORE THE STATE RAISE THE RATES FOR HOME HEALTH ON FOR A PARTICULAR TWENTY FOUR HOUR. DUTY NURSING WE RAISE THE RATES FOR FOR SOME PROVIDERS IN EXCHANGE FOR THEM DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB SO THEY HAVE TO DO A GOOD QUALITY JOBS TO GET THOSE HIGHER RATES. FARM SOON RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP. SO IN CASE MANAGEMENT ARM ALL THE PLANS REPORTED THAT THEY DO CASE MANAGEMENT DIRECTLY. THE OUT REACH -- ON POINT IN ROMAN ON THE CCS INDIVIDUAL ORDERED WHAT PANI TRANSITION AND THROUGHOUT -- THE TIMES THE CCS INDIVIDUAL INC AND THEY JUST STARTED THEY DO FOCUS ON THE HIGHER RISK MEMBERS. THE PLAN STAFF TO DELIVER THOSE SERVICES INCLUDE NURSES SOCIAL WORKERS MOM LICENSE CARE COORDINATION STAFF. WHO THAT DELIVERS THE SERVICE OFTEN DEPENDS ON THE MEDICAL ACUITY OR COMPLEXITY AND THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED SO FOR EXAMPLE SOCIAL WORKERS WILL DEAL WITH THE -- SUCH. A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES THAT HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH. ON THEY ALSO REPORTED THAT THEY WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE P. C. P. M. SPECIALISTS TO ENSURE THE CCS CONDITION ISN'T THE NEEDS ARE MET AS WELL AS ALL PREVENTIVE. AND PRIMARY CARE SERVICES. AS FAR AS LAPSES IN MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY -- THE DIRECTOR EXPLAINED WELL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ELIGIBILITY I JUST WANT TO COMMENT THE PLANS OF A REALLY STRONG INCENTIVE TO KEEP PEOPLE MEDI CAL WE DON'T GET PAID WE CAN YOU KNOW PROVIDE SERVICES. SO WE ALL DO OUR REGION SUPPORT TO ASSIST MEMBERS WITH PAPERWORK IN ELIGIBILITY WE COORDINATE WITH THE COUNTY CCS OFFICES AND THE COUNTY MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY OFFICES. AND WE FRANK WE HAVE BIG CHALLENGES HERE ALL BECAUSE THE CCS STAFF HAVE ACCESS TO THE MEDS -- OF WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW THE SYSTEM THAT IS THE SYSTEM OF RECORD OF ELIGIBILITY. AND SO THEY KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY'S RE DISCRIMINATION IS COMING UP WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS IS PLANTS AND SO WE DO DEPEND ON THEM TO GIVE US A HEADS UP BUT WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TO KEEP SOMEONE ON MEDI CAL. BOMB AS FAR AS THE MAINTENANCE AND TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS ALL THE PLANS REPORT THEY PROVIDE THE CCS MAINTENANCE AND TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CCS NUMBER LETTER. LETTING YOU REIMBURSEMENT LODGING PARKING MILEAGE REIMBURSEMENT BUT IS ON THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED WE ALSO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS ANYWAY UNDER MEDI CAL SO AT THE HEALTH PLAN WE PROVIDE WHATEVER'S THE MOST GENEROUS TO RECEIVE EASIEST FOR THE FOR THE MEMBER TO USE -- I WON'T GET INTO THE EVALUATION TOO MUCH I THINK WE GENERALLY SUPPORT EVALUATION THAT'S IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SB -- EIGHT FIFTY SIX WE CAN CERTAINLY SUBMIT IN WRITING IDEAS ABOUT METRICS I JUST DO WANT TO SAY THAT -- THE THE UCS THE CASF TEAM DID THE CCLI AND CAL MANY CONNECT VALUATION DID A GREAT JOB THE TELEPHONE SURVEY DATA IS VERY RICH AND PROVIDED A WEALTH OF INFORMATION. AND FINALLY YOU KNOW IT'S EARLY IN THE PROCESS REALLY WANTING COURAGE THE DIRECT AND LOCAL. ON COMMUNICATIONS THAT'S HOW WE'RE GONNA SOLVE PROBLEMS IS A LOT OF PEOPLE GO THROUGH RIGOROUS AN APPEALS PROCESS OR TELL US -- WE WILL WE WE WE ARE EAGER TO SOLVE THE ISSUES AND START THE SHOES AND WORK THROUGH THEM. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU. THE NEXT WE HAVE -- MAYOR OF MORTON. HOSPITALS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. WE APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF SB FIVE EIGHTY SIX AND TWENTY SIXTEEN CCHA HAS PARTICIPATED IN QUARTERLY MEETINGS WITH THE STATEMENT STATEWIDE CCS ADVISORY COUNCIL INITIAL STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS OF MOST OF THE COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEMS OR COAST. AND REGULAR MEETINGS WITH THE CHILDREN'S REGIONAL INTEGRATED SERVICE SYSTEM OR CHRIS A GROUP OF PARENTS PROVIDERS AND COUNTY CCS STAFF FROM TWENTY EIGHT NORTHERN COUNTIES. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE INCREDIBLY HARD WORK THE DEPARTMENT THE KOS PROVIDERS FAMILIES AND OUR FELLOW ADVOCATES A PUT IN DURING THESE MEETINGS AND ESPECIALLY IN BETWEEN THEM TO ENSURE THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM PROGRAM GOES SMOOTHLY -- TO SEVERAL DELAYS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM WHICH WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT THE DEPARTMENT I WAS REALLY MAKING SURE THE COUNTIES WERE READY BEFORE THEY WERE ALL THAT OUT BUT DUE TO IMPLEMENTATION. WERE ONLY JUST STARTING TO GET A SENSE OF HOW THINGS ARE GOING IN PHASE ONE COUNTIES AND EVEN LESS SO IN PHASE TWO COUNTIES -- AND SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT SOME NEW ISSUES COULD ARISE ONCE THE CONTINUITY OF CARE PROVISIONS LAPSE WHICH WILL ONLY START TO HAPPEN THIS SUMMER AND PHASE ONE COUNTIES AND SEVEN MONTHS AFTER THAT FOR FACE -- TO WITH BUT WITH ALL OF THAT IN MY AND I'M JUST LIKE TO LEAVE THE COMMITTEE WITH THE THE FOLLOWING POINTS AND AGAIN THIS IS BASED ON ANECDOTAL STORIES -- AND ME TO TALK ABOUT THE EVALUATION OF THE END BUT THAT TO US IS WHY THE EVALUATION IS SO IMPORTANT THAT'S ALL WE'RE EVER GOING TO GET AND WE WNT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REALLY KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD BEFORE WE EXPAND THIS OUT TO OTHER COUNTIES. SO A FIRST WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS BUT WE'VE HEARD THAT AT LEAST ONE OF THE CO IS MAYBE DELEGATING ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR CASE MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. WHICH WE DO NOT BELIEVE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF SB FIVE EIGHTY SIX WE HAVEN'T YET HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE CLOTHES WE WILL BE DOING THAT -- AS A RESULT OF THIS PROCESS BUT WANTED TO FLAG THAT. SECOND WE HAVE HEARD THAT SOME COUNTY CCS OFFICES MAY BE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THE DOCUMENTATION THEY NEED FROM THE COAST TO DETERMINE MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY FOR CCS WHICH THEY HAVE TO DO PERIODICALLY -- AT STILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITY EVEN IN WHOLE CHILD MODEL COUNTIES AND THIRD THERE MAY BE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR CCS FAMILIES DUE TO LOT THE LOSS OF THE UNOFFICIAL SOCIAL WORK FUNCTION THAT THE CCS A CASE WORKER SOUTH. PERFORMED ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS INVOLVES WHEN A CHILD MEDI CAL LAPSES SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF PAPERWORK ISSUE. AND THEY HAVE TO BE RE ENROLLED AND COUNTY CCS APAS TYPICALLY HELP FAMILIES DO THIS I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM ADULT MEN THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF THE CLOTHES ARE DOING BUT WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY HEARING IT'S HAPPENING UNIVERSALLY -- AND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF HAND HOLDING THAT WE'RE STILL KIND OF TROUBLE SHOOTING -- WITH THE COSTA WANTED TO FLY ABOUT. LEADING UP TO THIS HEARING WE DID START SOME INITIAL OUT REACH TO THE CLOSE ABOUT THESE CONCERNS WHICH REALLY WERE JUST STARTING TO AGGREGATE AGAIN WERE NOT EVEN A FULL YEAR INTO IMPLEMENTATION. AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM TO RESOLVE THESE AND WE'RE HEARING A LOT OF STORIES ABOUT HOW PROVIDERS AND MEMBERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS ARE GETTING A LOT OF THEIR PROBLEMS ADDRESSED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO HEAR THAT WE THINK THAT'S HOW THIS. REALLY SHOULD BE HANDLED. SO FINALLY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A CONCERN WITH THE WHOLE TOP MODEL EVALUATION I WAS VERY HAPPY TO HEAR FROM THE DIRECTOR THAT THE DEADLINE HAS BEEN MOVED OUT WE'RE NOT THAT. WAS A CONCERN IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S BEEN ADDRESSED -- IN ADDITION WE DID PROVIDE COMMENTS TO THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE DRAFT SCOPE OF WORK THAT THEY RELEASED AT THE LAST US CCS ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS THE DRAFT THAT WE SAW REFLECTS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SB SB FIVE EIGHTY SIX FOR THE EVALUATION. SOME OF THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS IN THE STATUTE ARE DRESSED ONLY SPARINGLY IN THE SCOPE OF WORK AND OTHERS NOT AT ALL -- AND THE SCOPE OF WORK IS OVERLY DEPENDENT UPON THE USE OF SURVEY DATA -- SURVEY INSTRUMENTS OF UNKNOWN VALIDITY TO MEASURE ASPECTS OF THE WHOLE TOP MODEL IMPLEMENTATION LIKE UTILIZATION ACCESS ACCESS TO SERVICES AND WE THINK THOSE COULD BE BETTER MEASURED. BY CLAIMS DATA AND COUNTER DATA AND EVEN SUCH A CHART SAMPLING. THIS EVALUATION IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THE CHILDREN IN THIS PROGRAM ARE GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED BEFORE IT'S EXPANDED TO NEW COUNTIES AND WE THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT -- THAT WE WOULD URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHETHER ADOPTING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- TO ENSURE THE VALUATION ADDRESSES THE REQUIREMENTS AND FINALLY TO SEX HAPPENS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT MISS BERKELEY. OBSERVERS THEY'RE JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT WE AT FAMILY VOICES OF CALIFORNIA REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT BASED ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM CCS FAMILIES. ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE DURING THE TRANSITION TO THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE. FAMILY VOICES HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN MAKING SURE THE FAMILY PERSPECTIVE IS HEARD IN THE COLLABORATIVE PROCESSES BEFORE DURING AND AFTER THE PASSAGE OF FIVE SB. FIVE EIGHTY SIX AND ONE OF OUR CURRENT PROJECT IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO PROVIDE OUR REGION EDUCATION. IN THE FORM OF WORKSHOPS WEBINARS RESOURCES AND PHONE AND EMAIL SUPPORT TO FAMILIES AND FAMILY CENTER STAFF AROUND THE TRANSITION TO THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL -- AND TO LISTEN TO THEIR STORIES ABOUT THE LEAD UP TO YOU AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW PROGRAM. A MORE STREAMLINED SYSTEM OF CARE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH SPECIAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS IS NECESSARY FOR BOTH PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS STATEWIDE. AND MOMENTS LIKE THIS PROVIDED CRUCIAL SETTING FOR US TO COME TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MODEL CREATED. TO REACH THAT GOAL IS DESIGNED IN A FAMILY CENTERED WAY -- WE'VE HEARD A LOT FROM FAMILIES AND A FEW PATTERNS HAVE EMERGED KEEPING IN MIND THAT IT IS STILL EARLY ON I'LL BEGIN BY SAYING THAT ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS TO FAMILY CENTEREDNESS IS GETTING INFORMATION OUT IN AN ACCESSIBLE WAY -- CURRENTLY THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AROUND HOW FAMILIES LEARN ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT HAVE COME OR ARE SEEM TO COME WITH THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL. FAMILIES WHO ARE CURRENTLY WELL AWARE OF THE CHANGES ARE THE SAME FAMILIES WHO ARE HISTORICALLY ONE FORMED ABOUT SYSTEMS NAVIGATION DUE TO THE TIME RESOURCES. LANGUAGE CAPACITY AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS TO SEEK OUT AND UTILIZE THAT INFORMATION. I'M EVEN AFTER THE WRITTEN NOTICES AND PHONE CALLS BY THE DEPARTMENT IN PLANS -- AN OUT REACH ME -- WORKSHOPS AND MEETINGS BY THE PLANS. FOR FAMILIES MANY FAMILIES AND PROFESSIONALS WE'VE CONNECTED WITH DURING OUR WORK ON THIS PROJECT STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S CARE -- ANOTHER PATTERN THAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT A LOT OF FAMILIES ARE REALLY FEELING THE LOSS OF THE CARE COORDINATION AND CASE MANAGEMENT OF THE NURSE CASE MANAGER THEY WORKED WITH THROUGH THE COUNTY PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION. WHEN CONNECTING WITH HEALTH PLANS STUFF ABOUT THEIR CHILD CARE MANY CARE GIVERS ARE GIVEN -- THE MEMBER SERVICES PHONE NUMBER AND THOSE -- AND TOLD THAT THOSE WHO STUFF THE PHONE LINES ARE ABLE TO HELP AND ADDRESS CONCERNS. AND THE SPECIALIZED AND PERSONALIZED CARE COORDINATION OF THE MOST MEDICALLY COMPLEX CHILDREN IN THE STATE IS ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE BENEFITS OF THE CCS PROGRAM. AND THEIR PLACEMENT OF THAT BENEFIT BY THE PLANS JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO BE COMPARABLE AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS -- AS FAMILY VOICES THE WORK WE'VE DONE AROUND THESE ISSUES WAS DEPENDENT ON THE COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION AND TEAMWORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT. THE HEALTH PLANS OTHER FAMILY SUPPORT AGENCIES AND HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS AND COUNTLESS FAMILIES AND CHILDREN INVOLVED IN THIS TRANSITION SO I JUST LIKE TO EXTEND A BIG THANK YOU TO EVERYONE INCLUDED IN THAT LIST -- AS WELL AS THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE HERE TODAY FOR PUTTING IN THE WORK TO IMPROVE CCS FOR OUR CHILDREN. THANK YOU AND FINALLY A FISCALLY. THANK YOU TERRY MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN SPECIALTY CARE COALITION. CSEC REPRESENTS OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEDIATRIC SUBSPECIALTY PHYSICIAN STATEWIDE THE PROVIDE LIFESAVING AND LIFE ENHANCING CARE FOR CHILDREN ENROLLED IN CCS. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATION SB FIVE EIGHTY SIX THAT AUTHORIZED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WHOLE CHILD MODEL INCLUDED BOTH PATIENT. AND PROVIDER PROTECTIONS INCLUDING MAINTENANCE OF CCS STANDARDS COMPREHENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT BY QUALIFIED STAFF CONTINUITY CONTINUITY OF CARE PROTECTIONS AND A ROBUST EVALUATION TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS DELIVERING ON ITS GOALS. WE ARE NEARLY IN. WE ARE NEARLY A YEAR END FOR PHASE ONE IMPLEMENTATION AND SIX MONTHS FOR FACE TO WITH FACE THREE THE LARGEST COUNTY IN TERMS OF CCS POPULATION SCHEDULED FOR JULY FIRST. WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF DH CS THE PLANS PROVIDERS COUNTIES AND FAMILY AND CHILDREN'S GROUPS TO ENSURE THAT THE TRANSITION FOR EACH OF THESE PHASES GO AS SMOOTH AS POSSIBLE TO ENSURE NO HARM FOR THESE MEDICALLY COMPLEX CHILDREN. WITH RESPECT TO HOW IMPLEMENTATION IS GOING I WILL PREFACE IT BY SAYING IT IS STILL VERY EARLY. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF FEEDBACK FROM MEMBERSHIP HOWEVER ISSUES MAY ARISE OVER TIME. WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME POSITIVE COMMENTS WORTH NOTING TODAY. TO GREATER ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLICITY FOR AUTHORIZATIONS AND BILLING WORKING WITH ONE PAYER INSTEAD OF TWO ALSO AS WELL. AS WELL AS THE CARBON PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND OR ENHANCE PROGRAM AND SERVICES SO ONE EXAMPLE IS CAUGHT ITS CHILDREN'S CENTER IS WORKING WITHIN CAL HEALTH PLAN ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLEX HEALTH CARE MEDICAL HOME MODEL. WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED SOME ISOLATED CONCERNS AND ONE REGION RELATED TO DELAYS IN TRANSPORTATION FOR PATIENT AND FAMILY IS WHICH CAUSE MISSED APPOINTMENTS. AND LIMITED ACCESS TO DM ME WHICH IS -- REALLY A PROBLEM IN MANY REGIONS STATE RIDE -- AS WELL AS CONTRACTING WITH SATELLITE HOSPITALS AND EVEN SOME PROVIDERS HOWEVER THE PLANTS HAVE MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO RECTIFY THESE ISSUES AS THEY ARISE. SOME PROBLEMS EARLY ON OR ARE TO BE EXPECTED -- WITH THE HEALTH CARE TRANSITION OF THIS MAGNITUDE. CSEC ALSO SUPPORTS THE RECOMMENDATION THAT THE EXPECTATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS AS IT RELATES TO CASE MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE COLLECTIVELY DISCUSSED AND AGREED UPON. SO THAT THERE IS CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE PLANS AND CCS PROGRAMS. I OFTEN THINK ABOUT THE FAMILY CARE MAPS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED IN FORUMS SUCH AS THESE FAMILIES ARE COMMONLY NAVIGATING DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS FROM NOT JUST ONE BUT MANY SPECIALISTS. AND NEED SUPPORT BEYOND THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AFFECTED CASE MANAGEMENT WILL OFTEN RESULT IN BETTER FAMILY EXPERIENCE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES AND EVEN REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS. WHILE THE PRACTITIONER EXPERIENCE IS IMPORTANT IT IS THE FAMILY EXPERIENCE THAT IS PARAMOUNT WHEN ASSESSING WHETHER TO PULL CHILD MODEL IS DELIVERING COORDINATED HIGH QUALITY CARE. I'M GLAD THAT FAMILY VOICES IS HERE TODAY TO LEND THEIR PERSPECTIVE OF THE FAMILIES. WITHRESPECT TO THE EVALUATION WE CAN MEND THE DEPARTMENT FOR CONTRACTING WITH A REPUTABLE UNIVERSITY TO CONDUCT THAT WE AGREE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE VALUATION DESIGN MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW. AND HOW OLD THEY WILL BE MEASURED SHOULD BE CLEARLY LAID OUT IN THE SCOPE OF WORK WITH REALLY NO BIAS OVER ONE MODEL OR THE OTHER. THE METHODOLOGY SHOULD INCLUDE A NUMBER OF METRICS THAT EXTEND BEYOND TELEPHONIC SURVEYS. AND IT IS APPROVED IN IT IN AN YEAH AND IT IS PRUDENT TO KNOW WHETHER PLANS OR HEARING TO THE CCS AND STANDARDS INCLUDING REFERRALS TO CCS PANEL PROVIDERS. AS SPECIAL CARE CENTERS TO MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF CARE FOR HIS TEETH MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN. WE ALSO AGREED THAT A MINIMUM OF TWO YEARS OF DATA FOR EACH COUNTY SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE EVALUATION DESIGN -- I'LL CLOSE WITH THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT THE COUNTY ORGANIZE HEALTH PLANS THE LEGISLATURE FAMILIES PROVIDERS. AND THE COUNTIES AS WELL AS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE FOR THESE CHILDREN. THANK YOU [inaudible] COMMENCEMENT LEO [inaudible] FINANCE. OKAY QUESTIONS ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY BYE DID IF YOU DID HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I WANT -- TO THE SPACE ON THE FIRST OF ALL IT'S ALWAYS HEARD IT THE NO THE LOSS OF THE CARE COORDINATION. CORD CARE CORNERED COUNTY IS THE IS THE SELLER IS OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A CARE ACCORDING TO THE HEALTH PLAN -- SO I GUESS ONE QUESTION IS IS THAT -- YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT ISSUES ABOUT POTENTIAL LAPSES -- YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE FATHER PEOPLE WORK ON TIME AND SO FORTH. IS THE CARE KOREAN THE HEALTH PLAN TASKS WITH HELPING SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN ON CCS EVEN IF THEY'RE NO LONGER AND ROLE THAT HEALTH PLAN BECAUSE THERE'S LAPSE OR SOME OTHER PROBLEM THAT HAPPENED. DOES IS THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY GOING TO BE THERE. BUT UNLIKE THE K. THIS THE COUNTY COORDINATOR ISN'T TIED TO WHETHER YOU'RE YOU KNOW I MEAN IT'S SO I DO SOME WORRY ABOUT THESE GAS OR SOMEONE'S AS O. OKAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE NOT IN OUR PLAN YOU KNOW YOU SELL OFF WHATEVER AND NOW IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. BECAUSE IT'S YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT ROLLED CELLS ARE TIED TO THE HEALTH PLAN I'D IT'S GOING TO BE SURE THAT SO WHOSE. THIRDS IS IS IS THAT POINT OF CONTACT PERSON GOING TO ALWAYS BE THERE FOR THEM. SO ALL ALL STARTIN IN MY AND I CAN TALK ABOUT LIKE ON THE GROUND SO IT DEPENDS -- IF YOU ARE A FAMILY WHOSE CHILD IS BOTH CCS ELIGIBLE AND MEDICALLY ELIGIBLE AND THEY'RE TIED TOGETHER. AND YOU ARE SENSE EITHER ONE WHICH IS MEDICAL EIGIBILITY RENEWAL OR MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY RENEWAL AND YOU DO NOT RESPOND -- IT DEPENDS ON THE COUNTY IN TERMS OF HOW LONG THEY TRIED TO PURSUE THE FAMILY TO REDO THE REDO TERMINATION IT'S AN ANNUAL RE DETERMINATION. AS A FAMILY DOESN'T RESPOND IN THE AND THE PATIENT IS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL BECAUSE OF THE FOR THEIR FAILURE TO RESPOND. THEN THE PLAN WILL BE SHOWING THEM AS A MEMBER ON THEIR NEXT MONTHLY ENROLLMENT FILE BECAUSE WE WOULD TERMINATE THEM FROM COVERAGE. IF THEY CALLED AND SAID HI. I USED TO BE A MEMBER OR I THOUGHT I WAS A MEMBER WHAT HAPPENS THE CAMP THE COUNTY HEALTH PLANS OFTEN AND OTHER PLANS DO AS WELL WHICH IS YOUR ELIGIBILITY IS NOT SHOWING AND THEY WILL SEND THEM BACK TO THE COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT WHICH IS. THE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THEM TO GET THEIR MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY. RE DETERMINED SO THEY CAN HELP ON THAT BUT IN TERMS OF LIKE THE CARE COORDINATION IF YOU'RE NOT SHOWING MEDICAL. OR MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY THE PLAN CAN'T DO A WHOLE LOT BASICAYE WELL I GUESS I GUESS THE THING IS IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING IS AN AND THIS CAN GET PRETTY COMPLICATED ALL RIGHT -- IS IS THAT THE CARE COORDINATORS THE CALCULUS OF ACTUALLY HELPING FAMILIES KEEP ON TOP OF THESE DEADLINES AND SO FORTH SO I I UNDERSTAND THAT SOMEONE JUST TOTALLY DOESN'T RESPOND AND THEY COMPLETELY FALL OFF. AND THEY CERTAINLY SHOW UP THAT'S ONE THING BUT I KNOW IT'S I'M THINKING YEAH BASICALLY I'M EXPECTING THE SAME LEVEL SERVICE THEY GOT BEFORE. THAT THE EXPECTATION NUTS SAID THAT THAT YOU KNOW AT LEAST CLUES ON IS NOT ELIGIBLE WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPED AYE COUNTY COORDINATOR. BUT BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE THE COORDINATOR TIED TO THE HEALTH PLAN. THIS CHANGING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WEATHER I WORK FOR THE COUNTY -- WAS WORTH IT DOES THAT CHANGE THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT THE THAT THE FACING YET THAT THE FAMILY WILL GET. THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE ANSWER IS NO I MEAN THE CARE OKAY SO THEIR EXPECTATION IS THEY WILL HELP SOMEONE EVEN IF IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE WE HELP WITH THE PAPERWORK WE HELP WE DO EVERYTHING OKAY. SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TOLD WELL YOU KNOW WHAT. WE YOU KNOW I YOU ARE LATE AND PIECE OF PAPER SO NO HELP WOULD BE OUR MEMBER AS WELL. BUT I MEAN THEY'RE NOT WE DON'T GET SAYS IT ROMAN R. ALRIGHT OKAY WELL ITSELF SO I SO THAT I MEAN THAT'S AN ISSUE I I JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE GOT TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE MAKE THIS AS SEAMLESS AS POSSIBLE AND CLEARLY SO IS NOT. ELIGIBLE I MEAN I GOT THAT BUT OF LATE THEM I'M HEARING IS THAT PEOPLE GAIN PING PONG AROUND DIFFERENT OFFICES AND THAT'S WHAT I HEAR I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN TELL ME THAT'S WHAT HEROES FROM FAMILIES LIKE. I HAVE YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS BEING PING PONG AROUND DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND THAT'S REALLY THE VALUE THAT THE AND I THINK WHEN I HEAR LOTS OF CARE COORDINATION PERHAPS THE PERSON FAMILY VOICES CAN CLARIFY -- IS IS THAT WAY IT IS IS SOMEONE WHO CAN ACTUALLY HELP ME DO SAID I'M NOT LIKE TOLD GO TO THIS PERSON CALL THAT NUMBER IT'S CENTER AT LIKE NO I WILL HELP YOU. DO I SPEAK TO THE YEAH SURE -- SO. WITH THE LOSS OF THE COUNTY IN PLAYED NURSE CASE MANAGERS WERE HEARING ABOUT -- FAMILIES MIGHT CALL INTO THAT NUMBER SERVICES NUMBER OR IN SOME CASES THEY DO HAVE A DIRECT CONTACT WITH SOMEBODY AT THE PLAN -- BUT WE'RE HEARING THAT FAMILIES ARE. GETTING DIRECTED TO YOU KNOW DAHLE OTHER DEPARTMENTS OR JUST GIVEN UP SEVERAL DIFFERENT. NUMBERS TO CALL TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT ISSUES SO -- ONE PHONE CALL MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED PREVIOUSLY BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION AND NOW WE'RE HEARING THAT THAT ONE PHONE CALL HAS TURNED INTO MULTIPLE PHONE CALLS IN SOME CASES. OKAY SO HOPE WE CAN ADDRESS THAT YEAH THERE YEAH I I SEE THAT'S WHY I MEAN I WAS TEACHERS AND I SEE TO CARRY AROUND THESE BINDERS RIGHT [inaudible] OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP TRACK OF FAMILY IS OFTEN -- ACTING AS THE CARE COORDINATOR IN THAT CASE -- SORRY OUT THOSE BINDERS ARE REALLY REAL THING THEY'RE HAPPY YEAH AND THEY'RE BIG RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY I SAID WE TALK ABOUT THE CARE MAPS SO SOUGHT S I HOPE AND I HOPE THAT'S PART EVALUATION TO THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT. SO I THINK THAT COMING DEBTS -- THE OTHER. IT I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THE EVALUATION -- HEY YEAH I PROCEED THAT WE'RE DOING TELEPHONIC SURVEYS AND THAT CERTAINLY GONNA BE VERY VALUABLE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET THE THE THE EXPERIENCE FROM THE FAMILIES -- BUT I HEARD ALSO BROUGHT UP THAT -- I MEAN THERE'S OTHER SOURCES OF DATA AS WELL -- RD SO WERE THAT WAS MENTIONED SO WE LOOKING. AND THEN ACTUALLY TELEPHONIC SKINNER NAY REALIZED OR CERTAIN EXPENSES INVOLVED BUT WELL IT WAS LIKE CCS SEVEN CALL ONE PROGRAM RATE THAT REALLY WE HAVE KIND OF LIKE THREE GROUPS OF PATIENTS. IN THERE RIGHT SO YOU HAVE THERE'S A GOOD CHUNK TO COME THROUGH THE WHO ARE YOU. TO COME TO THE NEXT YOU. YOU HAVE -- CHILDREN WITH C. C. L. WITH -- CCS CONDITIONS NUMBER COM AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CCS BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE -- COMMON AND THEN YOU HAVE THE ONE WITH THE REALLY RARE ONES RIGHT THERE WHERE IT'S KIND OF FROM A MANAGED CARE POINT OUT FROM A MANAGED CARE PLAN IF YOU'RE CUTTING THEIR DOT LIARS I MEAN THEY'RE NOT IT'S IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW HOW TO BUILD A NETWORK AROUND. YEAH ONE OR TWO PATIENTS RATE DEPENDING ON THE LUCK OF THE DRAW HOW MANY YOU HAVE YOUR PLAN. AND I HOPE THE VALUATION DOESN'T LIKE JUST LUMP EVERYONE TOGETHER AND AVERAGE IT ALL OUT. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT GONNA BE REFLECTED WE NEED TO LOOK AT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AT EACH OF THOSE GROUPS AND PARTICULARLY THE OUT LIARS I MEAN ANYWAY CCS IS A PROGRAM FOR THE OUT LIARS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A SEPARATE PROGRAM. WE DON'T JUST SAY HEY WHAT WE THINK IT'S NOT A GOOD I JUST A ROLL THEM ALL INTO JUST A MANAGED CARE PLANS A WILL GUESS WHAT YOU'RE ON YOUR YOUNG. TO GET THAT THAT THAT THAT THE RARE CONDITIONS AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE THE SUBGROUP THAT HAVE THESE REALLY RARE CONDITIONS. YES EVEN THAT -- YOU YEAH THIS TO BE A PROBABLY I'M LIKELY TO HAVE PROVIDE YOU KNOW THE THE SPECIALISTS EVEN IN YOUR IMMEDIATE AREA MAYBE IF YOU HAVE YOU KNOW REALLY BIG. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL THAT WORK BUT THOSE LIKELY IS AND WE NEED WE SHOULD EVALUATION IS NOT JUST AVERAGING EVERYONE OUT ACROSS ALL THOSE PATIENTS RIGHT THEY NEED TO BE LOOKED AT AS A SEPARATE. ENTITIES THOSE THAT HAPPENING AND EVALUATION. SO THE RESEARCHERS CAN HAVE ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF DATA NOT SINCE THE TELEPHONE SURVEYS I DON'T HAVE A VALUATION IN FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF PAGES BUT OF COURSE WE WOULD MAKE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA. AVAILABLE TO THEM SO THEY CAN LOOK AT IT FOR WHATEVER TRENDS AND OUT LIARS AND OTHER THINGS SO I DON'T. AND WE WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT OKAY SO I MIGHT BE SURE WERE. NOW IT'S NOT COMING BACK AND SAYING -- WE DEVELOP THE DESIGN AND I THE AVERAGE CCS PATIENT SOUNDING THERE SUCH THING AS AN AVERAGE CCS PATIENT. WE PUT THAT TOGETHER AND I APPRECIATE WE'RE GOING ON EARLY ON THAT'S ALL I EVER HEARD SELL WILLARD AND ONE SISTER -- BUT I ALSO HOPE THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO HAVE A GOOD EVALUATION AND WE SHOULD BE WAITING FOR THOSE RESULTS TO COME BEFORE YOU MOVE MORE VULNERABLE CHILDREN INTO A SYSTEM THAT -- YOU KNOW MAYBE COUNTY NOT YEAH I'D APPRECIATE THAT ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING ONE CHALLENGES CCS HAS ALWAYS BEEN IS THIRTY AT THE SEPARATE PROGRAM LAYERED ON TOP OF SO HOW WE BRING THIS TOGETHER BUT THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS WE COULD HAVE BROUGHT THOSE TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT.

SO I HAD AN INTEREST IN IN FALLS PREVENTION FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SON I WORKED AT THE COUNTY. AND I WORKED. FOR THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM SO I SAW A LOT OF MY OWN PERSONAL HISTORY. MY STEP MOTHER -- HAD A SERIOUS FALL. SHE WAS SO I THINK SHE WAS. EIGHTY AND T. SHATTERED HER FEMUR. SHE WAS IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS BECAUSE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SHE WAS A VERY LARGE WOMAN. SHE HAD TO USE A WHEELCHAIR UPPERPART OF HER RECOVERY -- AND WE COULDN'T GET. A WHEELCHAIR INTO HER HOME. IN FACT WE COULD GET A WHEELCHAIR IN HER WE'VE TEAR INTO MY HOME SO THAT I COULD CARE FOR HER AT AT HOME EITHER. SO SHE STAYED THERE FOR MANY MANY MONTHS COSTING A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY -- AND THEN EVENTUALLY HE DID GET HOME. CHEN ANOTHER FALL. WE MOVED HER INTO AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY CHEN OTHER FALL. AND THEN SHE WENT. SO AS STATED -- IN THE IN THE PROPOSAL IN THE BILL. SIXTY THE SIXTY BY TWENTY THIRTY AND WE CAN ESTIMATE BASED ON PAST HISTORY THAT ONE IN. THREE PEOPLE OVER SIXTY WILL HAVE A FALL. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT TRANSLATES INTO A HUGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE. IN CALIFORNIA WHO WILL BE FALLING AND THE COST OF THOSE FILES IT'S GOING. TO JUST BE EXPONENTIAL. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT INTERVENTIONS CAN PREVENT 11223% OF THOSE FALLS. SO WE I THINK THIS IS BY MY OPINION AND I'D LIKE TO STATE. THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND CALIFORNIA HAS A HUMANITARIAN. RESPONSIBILITY TO IMPLEMENT FALLS PREVENTION [inaudible] HI INTERVENTIONS [inaudible] AND UP. I ALSO THINK THEY HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME [inaudible] HI. I WAS VERY LUCKY TO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH MS AT AGE. SIXTY BECAUSE IT IS A DISEASE THAT USUALLY HITS YOUNG ADULTS. UNFORTUNATELY BY THE TIME I WAS DIAGNOSED I WAS SECONDARY PROGRESSIVE. WHICH IS AS BAD AS IT GETS AND I HAVE PROGRESSED RAPIDLY. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. AFFECTS MUSCLE STRAIN BALANCE COORDINATION. ALL OF WHICH MAKES FALL EVENT. MY WORST FALL. I BROKE IT ALL THE TOOLS IN MY LEFT FOOT. SO FAR I'M LUCKY TO GET HIM OF IT ALSO. UNFORTUNATE THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN MY HANDS TO MY ARMS BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE. I USE THEM. WE OVER THE YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS TO GET OUR HOME.

THAT ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A COSTS THAT WOULD pBEEN THAT WOULD EXCEED WHAT THIS REQUEST IS. AND IF WE WERE ABLE TO SAY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PREVENT THAT MANY FALLS THAT WE SAY THIS IS A COST NEUTRAL EVEN COST SAVINGS OR PREVENT MORE FALSE SO. PEOPLE COULD LOOK AT STUDIES RELATED -- TO IF YOU HAVE GRAB BARS WHICH IS NOT WHAT THE WHAT THE RATE OF FALLS ARE IN AND THE CONSEQUENT CONSEQUENTIAL COSTED ESPECIALLY SINCE. MEDI CAL IS THE PRIMARY PAYER. FOR LONG TERM CARE SERGIO LONG TERM CARE SERVICES NURSING HOME CARE AND AS WELL AS MANY SEE YEARS -- DO DEPEND ON IT ALTHOUGH MEDICARE'S ALSO THERE.

WE'LL KEEP IT BRIEF -- MY NAME'S VIRGINIA CORRIGAN I AM A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH USE LAWCENTER I'M MORE PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS REQUEST FOR FUNDS FOR THE FOSTER YOUTH IN RICHMOND GRANT PILOT PROGRAMS. ON EXTRA CURRICULAR IS LIKE ARTS SPORTS VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS ARE A VITAL PART OF CHILDHOOD IN THERE ALSO A CRITICAL INTERVENTION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. UNFORTUNATELY FOSTER CARE GIVERS CURRENTLY RECEIVE NO FUNDING FOR EXTRA CURRICULAR. SO THE FOSTER YOUTH IN RICHMOND GRANT PILOT PROGRAM IS A STEP TOWARD ADDRESSING THE BARRIERS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE FACE TO ACCESS THESE ACTIVITIES -- SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THE PARTICIPATING IN EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES ACTUALLY HELPS YOUNG PEOPLE'S BRAINS REQUIRE PHYSICALLY FROM TRAUMA. ON THEY'VE ALSO BEEN PROVEN TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE RISKY BEHAVIOR. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY -- EXTRACURRICULAR PARTICIPATION PROVIDE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH VITAL CONNECTIONS TO SUPPORT OF ADULTS TO BE CAN YOU CAN BECOME MENTORS ROLE MODELS IN LIFETIME CONNECTIONS. THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THIS EXTRA CURRICULAR PARTICIPATION CAN ALSO IMPROVE PLACEMENT STABILITY. ON ANY CAN EVEN LEAD TO COMMITTED CARING PLACEMENTS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN FACT I HAVE -- WORK CLOSELY WITH A YOUNG WOMAN -- I SEE WHY SEE MEMBER WHO ACTUALLY FOUND A PERMANENT PLACEMENT WITH HER BASKETBALL COACH AND IS THRIVING THERE. UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE ALL OF THESE BENEFITS THE COST OF EXTRACURRICULAR IS CONTINUE TO POSE A BARRIER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND IS PART OF DEVELOPING A POLICY BRIEF ON THIS ISSUE AND AS OUR WORK THROUGH OUR WORK WITH THE QUALITY PARENTING INITIATIVE WE'VE SPOKEN WITH. ON YOUTH CARE GIVERS AND AGENCY STAFF ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND WORK DIRECTLY IN TWENTY SEVEN COUNTIES AND OVER AND OVER WE HEARD STORIES ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T AFFORD TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ACTIVITIES THEY WERE PASSIONATE ABOUT -- SO THIS BUDGET REQUEST SIX TO TAKE A STEP FORWARD TO AMELIORATE THE BARRIER THE REQUESTED FUNDS WOULD PERMIT FOR PILOT COUNTIES TO PROVIDE GRANTS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE -- WE REQUESTED FUNDS THAT WOULD PERMIT YOUNG PEOPLE IN THOSE KIND AND COUNTIES TO RECEIVE UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY THE COST -- OF AN EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITY -- AND THEN DATA COLLECTED DURING THE PILOT WILL BE USED TO EXAMINE CONTINUING OR EXPANDING THE PROGRAM SO ALL YOU THINK CALIFORNIA CAN ACCESS IT -- JUST DO WANT TO MENTION THAT FEELING TO PROVIDE THIS ON THIS OPPORTUNITY HAS COSTS BOTH HUMAN AND FINANCIAL TO OUR FOSTER YOUTH. UNFORTUNATELY WE KNOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE IN FOSTER CARE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES IN IT EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT BOTH DURING AND AFTER THEIR TIME IN CARE OR AND FAILED TO EXPERIENCE PLACEMENT STABILITY IN PERMANENCY ESPECIALLY OUR ADOLESCENCE. SO -- THE FOSTER YOUTH IN RICHMOND GRANT PILOT PROGRAM WAS SUPPORT THE GOALS OF ON THE FAMILY FIRST ACTON CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR FOSTER YOUTH AND HELP FOSTER YOUTH EXPERIENCE A HEALTHY JOYFUL CHILDHOOD.

GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS REQUEST AND FOR SHEDDING LIGHT ON THIS ATTENTION THE LARGE BREATH OF WHICH I THINK WE'RE ONLY NOW STARTING TO REALIZE. IN FACT IN THE BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY THE STATE WILL HAVE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND AGING LGBT INDIVIDUALS LIVING HERE. THE SPECIFIC REQUEST CAME OUT OF THE EFFORTS ORIGINALLYSTARTED BY ONE OF YOUR CURRENT COLLEAGUE SCOTT WIENER WHEN HE WAS ON THE CITY -- BOARD IN SAN FRANCISCO HE HELPED INITIATE A GROUNDBREAKING I TASK FORCE REPORT THAT HAD MANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THIS DEMOGRAPHIC. IN ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT RECOMMENDATIONS IS WHAT WE HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT TODAY WHICH IS TO INCREASE THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE GREATER MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. YOUR SUPPORT AND EFFORTS TO REDUCE ISOLATION AND LOOKING BEYOND JUST OUR REQUEST OUR HOPE IS THAT WE CAN ESTABLISH AN INNOVATIVE MODEL CONTINUE TO ESTABLISH WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING. THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THERE MAY BE POTENTIAL TO BE ON THE PATH DOWN THE ROAD TO TAKE THIS MODEL AND SHARE WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE WE DID THIS WITH THE LGBT BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH SCOTT THROUGHOUT SENATOR WE ARE FIRST INTRODUCED IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOW. BEING IMPLEMENTED STATEWIDE. WE KNOW THAT ALL SENIORS IN CALIFORNIA FACE SIMILAR PROBLEMS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE LONG TERM CARE AFFORDABILITY AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT WE KNOW THAT THOSE ARE AMPLIFIED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR LGBT Q. SENIORS -- WHILE 60% OF LGBT Q. SENIORS LET ALONE AS COMPARED TO ABOUT 20% OF THE GENERAL SENIOR POPULATION AND THE VAST MAJORITY REPORT FEELING HIGH LEVELS OF ISOLATION. ISOLATION PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT OF AS EARLY AS A MENTAL HEALTH RISK HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE HIGHLY PREDICTIVE OF NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES MORTALITY AND INCREASED HEALTH CARE COSTS AS PEOPLE AGE. TWENTY AN OPEN HOUSE ARE WELL ESTABLISHED ENTITIES WERE SEEKING AND ISOLATION AND LGBT Q. SENIORS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THESE HEALTH DISPARITIES BUT LET US ALL REMEMBER ESPECIALLY AS WE HEAD INTO THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF STONE WALL. BUT THESE ARE THE HEROES AND THE ACTIVISTS OF THE LGBT Q. MOVEMENT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. WE'RE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO EXPAND OUR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT OR SUPPORT SERVICES AT OUR VOLUNTEER CONNECTION PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ISOLATION IN THIS POPULATION. WE BELIEVE THAT WITH MORE SUPPORT WE CAN NOT ONLY SERVE MORE SENIORS IN OUR AREA BUT THAT WE ARE CREATING THE INNOVATIVE MODELS OF CARE THAT CAN BE UTILIZED ACROSS THE STATE. TO SERVE LGBT Q. SENIORS AND OTHER MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS WILL BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THEM IN WE DO SUPPORT OUR COLLEAGUES EARLIER WITH THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING.

HOME GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE MY NAME IS -- AND TO THE WORLD IS AT THE JUSTICE COALITION [inaudible] AND WE ONE OF THE LEADING COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION TO HELP DEVELOP AND WORK ON IMPLEMENTATION OF ALLEY COUNTY'S FIRST OFFICE OF YOUTH DIVERSION AND DEVELOPMENT. ONE OF MY FAMILY WAS DEVASTATED BY INCARCERATION THE DEPORTATION AND HOMELESSNESS. MY FATHER WAS ARRESTED AND DEPORTED WHEN I WAS ABOUT SIX YEARS OLD. AND SET UP THAT MY BROTHER WAS LOCKED UP IN A PROBATION CAM FOR STEALING FROM SEVEN ELEVEN AROUND THE SAME TIME WE FOUND OURSELVES HOMELESS MY MOTHER BECAME A SINGLE MOM WITH A SIGN IN PROBATION CAM. A FEW YEARS LATER MY FIRST ARREST CAME AT THE AGE OF TWELVE AND I WAS CONVICTED OF VANDALISM. AND POSSESSION OF DRUG PARAPHERNALIA. THE CUBS THAT ARREST ME INSULTED ME AND CHALLENGE ME BY THING I WOULD NEVER MAKE IT IN JUVENILE HALL AND LITERALLY LAUGHED AT ME OF THE SCOLDED MEAN INTIMIDATED ME INSIDE THE POLICE STATION. THAT EXPERIENCE BECAUSE MY SELF ESTEEM AND THAT ME VERY ANGRY ALSO LEFT ME WITH A JUVENILE RECORD. I HADN'T BROUGHT MORE RUN INS WITH THE POLICE GROWING UP WHEN I TURNED EIGHTEEN I TRIED IN THIS IN THE ARMY. I SCORED A NINETY FOUR ON THAT. THE HIGHEST SCORE MY RECRUITER SAID THEY EVER SAW AND THEY BEGIN RUSHING TO SIGN ME UP. WHAT TO DO A LIVE SCAN MY FIRST FOR US AT AGE TWELVE CAME UP AND I WAS BARRED FROM IN THIS THING? HOW THEY TRY TO FIND MY WAY TO LIVE FOR THE YOUNG THE DOG KIND OF FOUND ANY AND SPEND TIME IN O'MALLEY COUNTY JAIL? IF I DID A VERSION PROGRAM I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IN THIS THAT WOULD HAVE NEVER CAUGHT UP ALLEN YOU SIT DEEPER INTO THE SYSTEM. IN OTHER COUNTY THE NUMBER OF YOUTH LOCKED UP IN YOUTH PRISONS A DEMONIC DRAMATICALLY DECREASED BECAUSE CRIMES GOT SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN YOUR PROBATION BUDGET HAS INCREASED BY OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN BALLOONING TO OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS. AS A RESULT F THE COUNTY SPEND BETWEEN 300-100-0400 THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO INCARCERATE YOUNG PERSON WELL IT ONLY COST BETWEEN A HUNDRED DOLLARS. TO FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR PRS A VERSION INTO YOU DEVELOPMENT SERVICES AND UNTIL THE OFFICE OF YOU THE VERSION OF ALAMO THIS TABLET SAYS HE DOES KNOW DEPARTMENT DEDICATED TO COORDINATING A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO YOU DEVELOPMENT IN OUR ENTIRE COUNTY OF ALMOST TEN MILLION PEOPLE. AND WHICH TWO POINT TWO MILLION OR 22% OF THE POPULATION ARE YOUTH UNDER. EIGHTEEN MAKING ALLEY COUNTY THE LARGEST THE YOUNGEST LARGE COUNTY IN THE NATION AND EVEN MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE. EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR CALIFORNIANS COUNTIES WITHIN SPEND BILLIONS ON THE PUNITIVE SUPERVISION AND INCARCERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE BUT ALMOST NOTHING ON COORDINATING YOUTH DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. IT'S WELL PAST DUE TIME TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT WORK FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. IT'S TIME TO PRIORITIZE THE FUTURE OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND IT'S TIME TO DIVEST FROM PUNISHMENT AND INVESTED DEVELOPMENT THANK YOU. AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DARIA THE REASON I AM AN ATTORNEY AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. AS YOU HEARD FROM ANTHONY SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT CAN HAVE LONG LASTING DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON YOUTH WITH THAT IN MIND LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB FOUR THIRTY NINE AND ALLOCATED THIRTY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. TO YOUTH PRE ARREST OF VERSION PROGRAMS DEMONSTRATING ITS UNDERSTANDING THAT A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH WHICH PROVIDES ACCESS TO SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO IMPROVE YOUTH OUTCOMES. AND PUBLIC SAFETY THIS ONE TIME BUDGET ALLOCATION FOR THE OFFICES OF YOUTH DEVELOPMENT AND DIVERSION PILOT PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE INTERESTED COUNTIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED. TO COORDINATE SUCH SERVICES FOR YOUTH AND COMMUNITIES OF HIGH NEED. THIS NEW APPROACH WILL USE A PUBLIC HEALTH PLANS TO LOOK AT ROOT CAUSES OF WHY YOUTH ENTER THE SYSTEM AND WILL COORDINATE PRE ARREST INTERVENTIONS. OUTSIDE OF THE COURT SYSTEM ALTHOUGH SOME PROBATION DEPARTMENTS HAVE DIVERSION PROGRAMS THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO YOUTH AFTER THEY'VE BEEN ARRESTED WHICH NOT ONLY IS HARMFUL TO USE. IT'S ALSO MORE COSTLY NUMEROUS STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT FORMAL COURT PROCESSING INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE CRIME WITH THAT IN MIND WE SPOT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU THANKS FOR MUCH ANY COMMENTS FROM DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES. AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH -- ANYONE ON THE ON THIS PROPOSAL WE CERTAINLY DO SEE THE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH CRIMINALIZATION VIEWS THE TEGULAE THOSE THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TOPOFFERS SYSTEM. OKAY THANK YOU HELLO FINANCE. QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS OKAY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS PRIDE THE FINANCIAL PART OF THE PROPOSAL FROM CENTER MINING SINCE OUT OF THE OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. OKAY -- NEXT TO HAVE -- THE INCREASE FUNDING FOR NON MEDICAL OUT OF HOME CARE -- FROM THE SYSTEM THE FROM THE SAME PER GUESS IT'D ADRIANA REALISTS ASSEMBLY IS TO WELCOME. WELCOME WE HAVE TWO SPEAKERS HERE. OKAY I RIGHTS REMEMBER. THREE OKAY IT WAS GETTING THE pBETTER HERE THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS I MEAN JENNIFER LESS WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE WE'RE REQUESTING EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING PER YEAR FOR THREE YEARS TO SUPPLEMENT THE CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT RATE PAID. TO LICENSE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES THAT SERVE INDIVIDUALS. WITH LIVING WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS OR EITHER HOMELESS OR AT RISK OF BEING HOMELESS THE SIZES FACILITIES ARE KNOWN AS BOARDING CARE AND PROVIDE HOUSING AND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR ADULTS OF ALL AGES WITH COMPLEX HEALTH. MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WHICH REQUIRE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE AND SUPERVISION. THESE FACILITIES CARE FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE HOMELESS AND HELP THEM GAIN THE TOOLS THEY NEED BEFORE MOVING INTO A LOWER LEVEL OF KERR. HOWEVER THIS VALUABLE HOUSING SAFETY NET IS QUICKLY DISAPPEARING. THESE FACILITIES CANNOT KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN DUE TO THE INCREDIBLY LOW STATE REIMBURSEMENT RATE. THE ONE THOUSAND FIFTY DOLLARS PAY PER MONTH BY SOCIAL BY SSI BENEFICIARIES IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. CONSEQUENTLY MANY FACILITIES REFUSED TO ACCEPT LOW INCOME CLIENTS WHO WOULD THRIVE IN ONE OF THESE FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY CANNOT SUSTAIN THEMSELVES FINANCIALLY WITH ONLY THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY. OUR REQUESTED THE REQUESTED FUNDING WOULD INCREASE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE. BY A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH AND STATEWIDE. THIS INITIAL INVESTMENT WOULD ADDRESS IMMEDIATE URGENT NEED TO CONFUSE RESOURCES INTO THE SYSTEM OF CARE WE BELIEVE THIS IMMEDIATE SHORT TERM FUNDING WILL STAY A STAR A STAVE OFF IMPLEMENT THESE FACILITIES. FROM CLOSING THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND LISA KUDROW REPRESENTING LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. ON'T DISK THIS PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH A MOTION RECENTLY PASSED BY OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT DIRECTED OUR HEALTH AGENCY TO EXPLORE SOLUTIONS TO THE FUNDING AND QUALITY CRISIS FACING THESE LICENSED RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. IN LA COUNTY WE'VE LOST MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED LICENSED BEDS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. AT A TIME WE WERE SEEKING SOLUTIONS FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THESE FACILITIES. WHICH ARE ON THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. OUR COUNTY IS DOING WHAT WE CAN WERE USING LOCAL FUNDING TO SUPPLEMENT RATES FOR TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS INCLUDING A THOUSAND FORMERLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. BUT IN OUR COUNTY THIS IS A SMALL FRACTION OF THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THIS LEVEL OF CARE. WE KNOW OTHER COUNTIES ARE LIKEWISE DOING WHAT THEY CAN INCLUDING SENATOR STONE INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES DOING WORK IN THIS AREA. ON TO SUPPORT THESE ENDANGERED FACILITIES BUT WE NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL WILL HELP US STABILIZE SOME BOARDING CARE FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE. BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH YOU TO EXPLORE LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS THAT HELP PEOPLE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS LIVE LIVES OF DIGNITY AND MEANING WHICH IS REALLY WHAT WE ALL WANT. SO WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS -- WE SEE IN THE FACILITIES THAT WE LICENSE -- NOT JUST FOR THOSE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND AND THEY DON'T RESIDENT FACILITIES BUT ALSO FACILITIES FOR SENIORS. THAT THOSE THAT WILL TAKE US A SIGH RECIPIENTS -- FREQUENTLY TAKE ONLY SS I RECIPIENTS WHICH MEANS THAT'S ABOUT SINGLE FUNDING STREAM THAT THEY HAVE AND IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO RUN A VERY HIGH QUALITY OPERATION WE EVEN WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS -- WITH THAT FUNDING STREAM WE ARE ENGAGED AND HAVE BEEN BEEN ENGAGED IN CAN WILL CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED WITH CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO LOOK FOR WAYS -- THAT WE CAN IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE ARE FURTHER DOING TO TRY AND SUPPORT TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP THESE FACILITIES OPERATE. AS EFFECTIVELY AS THEY CAN TO LOOK FOR OTHER OPTIONS AND SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION WE THINK IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU HELLO. FINANCE COMMENTS OKAY QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALRIGHT WELL THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION PRECIADO. Q. AND FINALLY -- THIS WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK -- TO SHOULD -- THE INCREASE FUNDING FOR IMMIGRATION EMERGENCIES I UNDERSTAND -- WHO'S WHO'S IN. RESPOND TO SERVICES OKAY WHAT'S HER NAME. ACTUALLY HERRINGTON OKAY WELCOME. ALL RIGHT PLEASE COME UP AND AGAIN PAST THE THREE MINUTES. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE ALL THE TIME IF YOU DON'T WANT ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] RIGHT. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING? JUST YOURSELF OKAY ALL RIGHT. OKAY. RIGHT RIGHT WATER PAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK HERE TODAY MY NAME'S ASHLEY HERRINGTON THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS MANAGER FOR JEWISH FAMILY SERVICE IN SAN DIEGO. JEFF THIS IS THE KERN OPERATOR FOR THE SHELTER FOR ASYLUM SEEKING FAMILIES RELEASED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ALONG OUR BORDER WITH MEXICO. SINCE OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTH JEFFERSON THE SENATE -- RAPD RESPONSE NETWORK HAVE SHELTERED OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND VULNERABLE ASYLUM SEEKING CHILDREN OF PARENTS POLICE BY FEDERAL AUTHORITIES. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE STATE'S PARTNERSHIP AND ALLOCATING THE FUNDS NEEDED EARLIER THIS SPRING FOR A NETWORK TO CONTINUE OUR SUPPORT OF SERVICES. FOR FAMILY SLING VIOLENCE PERSECUTION. FOR IT NOT FOR THE SHELTER FOR MIGRANT FAMILIES OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS AND SAN DIEGO AND IMPERIAL COUNTIES WOULD BEEN RELEASED BY FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ON OUR STREETS. WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOUR UPDATED BUDGET REQUEST AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BE APPROPRIATED GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S PROPOSAL FOR THE IMMIGRATION RAPID RESPONSE RESERVE FUND. FOR A TOTAL OF A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION. OUR SHELTER OPERATES TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK SERVING BETWEEN SIXTEEN HE RIVALS EACH NIGHT WITH SERVICE ABOVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY INDIVIDUALS. UPON ARRIVAL MIGRANTS ARE SCREEN BY LICENSED CLINICIANS FOR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND SERIOUS ILLNESSES AND THEN RECEIVE LIMITED TREATMENT FOR INFECTIOUS URGENT MEDICAL CONDITIONS. MIGRANTS AND RECEIVE A HOT MEAL NEW CLOTHING SHOWER A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP AND WORK FOR THEIR CASE MANAGERS TO BOOK TRAVEL TO CONNECT WITH LOVED ONES ACROSS THE U. S.. MIGRANTS TYPICALLY STATE OR SHELTER FOR ONE OF THREE DAYS. THE PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES IS A CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF OUR SHELTER OPERATION BOTH TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE AND TO IDENTIFY ANY URGENT HEALTH NEEDS OF ASYLUM SEEKING FAMILIES. CURRENTLY ONLY A PORTION OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROVIDED AT THE SHELTER ARE FUNDED. OUR GOAL IS TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE STATE COUNTY AND NONPROFIT HEALTH PROVIDERS TO IDENTIFY SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR CENTRAL HEALTH SCREENING AND TREATMENT. TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE SHELTER WE ESTIMATE THAT THE THREE YEAR COST WILL BE% TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THIS INCLUDES SHELTER OPERATIONS HEALTH SCREENING AND LIMITED SCOPE HEALTH TREATMENT TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF COMMUNICABLE ILLNESSES. THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE DELIVERY MODEL INCLUDES ONSITE HEALTH SCREENING PROVIDED BY THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO LICENSE CLINICIANS AND CONTRACTED PROVIDERS. AS NEEDED TO FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CLINICS PROVIDE LIMITED TREATMENT ON SITE. WE WANT TO REITERATE THAT THESE ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE NOT CURRENTLY FULLY FUNDED. THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO IS UNIQUE IN THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE SERVICES AS PART OF ITS MODEL OF DELIVERY. THE COUNTY HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE TO THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF THOUSANDS OF MIGRANTS RELEASED OR SHELTER TO DATE. TO MAXIMIZE THE EFFICIENCY OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY IN THE NEW FISCAL YEAR IS RECOMMENDED THAT NONPROFIT HEALTH PROVIDERS ASSUME THE ROLE OF HEALTH SCREENING UNLIMITED SCOPE HEALTH TREATMENT. THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO WOULD LIKE TO RESUME THE ROUTINE AND CUSTOMARY ROLE OF EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY ONCE ANOTHER KEY FUNCTIONS OUTSIDE OF ROUTINE PRIMARY HEALTH SERVICES. NOTIFICATION OF A SEARCH SITUATION THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO MAY PROVIDE FRONTLINE ASSISTANCE WITH COMING OFF OR ASIANS. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE FROM THE IMMIGRATION RAPID RESPONSE RESERVE FUND AT TWENTY FILAMENT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO COVER THREE YEARS OF SHELTER OPERATIONS. INCLUDING HEALTH CARE ON THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO BORDER. THANK YOU. AYE COMMENTS FROM -- THE PARTIAL SERVICES. WE'VE BEEN VERY HAPPY TO PARTNER AND WORK WITH JEWISH FAMILY SERVICES FOR THEIR WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE IN THE SAN DIEGO BORDER MORE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND AND BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S RAPID RESPONSE FUNDS BEEN. ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO MAKING THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GAP -- FOR THIS YEAR AND FOR THE COMING YEAR SO WE'RE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN FURTHER CONVERSATION OKAY THANK YOU OHIO [inaudible] FINANCE [inaudible] FOR JAMIE DEPARTMENT FINANCES AS NOTED EARLIER WE TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IS PROVIDED THIS IN THE CURRENT YEAR FOR JEWISH SEARCHES FAMILY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. AND WE ALSO JUST RECENTLY APPROVED ANOTHER NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND FIRST THE HEALTH CARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE PROVIDED BY TO THE CLINICS ARE THERE. AND JUST ONE ANOTHER ALSO THERE'S TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET -- IF -- FOR THIS PURPOSE AND WILL CONTINUE WORK ADDRESS SEARCH AND FOR THE GREAT WORK THEY'RE DOING. OKAY THANK YOU. BYE COMMENT YES CENTER STONE. FIGURE OUT ONE IS JUST SO I THINK THE JEWISH FAMILY SERVICES FOR THE JOB THAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THE INFLUX -- THAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING -- MAN I KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY NOT UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE BUT I WAS JUST CURIOUS -- HOW YOU'RE ASSESSING THE THE NEEDS FOR IMMUNIZATION WENT OUT PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY COMING OVER WITH VERY LITTLE DOCUMENTATION? ARE YOU ABLE TO ERR ON THE SIDE THAT WE'RE NOT SURE AND WE'RE GOING TO IMMUNIZE AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE -- OUR WORST MEASLES CRISIS IN -- IN A LONG TIME WITHOUT IN TWO THOUSAND WE'VE EXTINGUISHES DISEASE SO WE HAVE CASES OF WHOOPING COUGH WHICH CAN BE A FAILED DAWSON'S FOR AN INFANT.

A JEWISH FAMILY SERVICES PROVIDING KIND OF THOSE SHELTERING IN CASE MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT BUT WE ARE IN -- COMMUNICATION WITH THE HEALTH PARTNERS INCLUDING THE COUNTY AND THE TO FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS AND THEY ARE WORKING AND HAVE PRIORITIZED -- PREGNANT WOMEN -- IN MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS THE IMMUNIZATION CENTER AND IMMUNIZATIONS AROUND ANY OF THE CONDITIONS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE SHELTER. FUTURE PLANS -- ARE TO INCREASE THAT TO WORK WITH THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO AND THE CLINICS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MONITORING THAT BECAUSE I'VE AS YOU'VE STATED PEOPLE ARE COMING IN WITH VERY LITTLE MOVES REALLY NO DOCUMENTATION -- SO WE'RE DOING IT ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS -- KIND OF KNOWING WHILE WEIGHING THE RISKS OF IN THE NEWS THAT IMMUNIZING VERSES I'M NOT PROVIDING IMMUNIZATIONS SO. IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT'S ON OUR RADAR NO I LIKE YOUR TIME SENSITIVE -- SEPARATION OF PREGNANT WOMEN FROM THE POTENTIAL POPULATION MAY BE. EFFECTIVE OF THE THE DANGERS OF A MINISTER OF MEASLES ISSUE NO IT'S A PEOPLE ARE A SYMPTOMATIC FOR FORTY SIX DAYS BEFORE -- THEY COME DOWN SYMPTOMS AND WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING -- HIGH DENSITY OF PEOPLE CONGREGATING TOGETHER -- WE WANT TO SEE -- A MEASLES EPIDEMIC -- EMANATING FROM SAN DIEGO AND SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

SO THEN YOU HAVE KIND OF FLARING ON DIFFERENT MULTIPLE -- RATES WITH IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE STATE DEPENDING ON WHAT REGIONAL CENTER WHEN YOUR RATES WERE ESTABLISHED AT WHAT POINT WE HAVE -- AND NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT OUR RATES ARE SET TO THAT I I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY MORE -- POINT OUT WE HAVE -- DDS SET RATES -- THAT HAVE BEEN BASED ON PRIOR YEAR'S ON COST STATEMENTS AND COST REPORTING HOWEVER -- THERE HAVE BEEN -- KIND OF A FREEZE AND AT A SHIFT FROM DOING ANY COST REPORTING WE ALSO HAVE THE SET RATES THAT ARE BASED ON THE ALTERNATIVE RESIDENTIAL MODEL WHICH IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE REST -- COMMUNITY -- CARE FACILITIES THAT ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH. THERE'S ESTABLISHED RATES IN THIS IN STATUTE THERE'S ALSO RATES THAT ARE BASED ON PROVIDERS USUAL AND CUSTOMARY. THERE'S RATES THAT ARE TIED TO MEDI CAL AND THEN THERE'S ALSO RATES THAT ARE NEGOTIATED BY THE REGIONAL CENTE -- DURING THE TIME WHEN THERE WAS THE RECESSION -- THERE WERE A NUMBER OF ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN THAT ALSO -- KIND OF CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMPLEXITIES OF OUR RATES SYSTEM ONE WAS RATE FREEZES THE OTHER WAS KIND OF MEDIAN RATES WHEN IT WAS APPLIED TO KIND OF TO THE BROADER NEGOTIATED RATES. DURING THAT TIME IT IT REALLY TO KIND OF SET IN PLACE WHERE DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU WERE AT WHAT POINT IN TIME IS KIND OF WHERE YOUR RATES WERE ESTABLISHED. THIS IS KIND OF IMPORTANT AS FAR AS WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE -- KIND OF A PARAMETERS OR EQUITIES WITHIN EACH OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS -- ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT I LIKE TO GIVE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THAT COMPLEXITY IS WHEN YOU COMPARE -- ONE REGIONAL CENTER THAT HAS RATE SUCH AS SOUTH CENTRAL THAT MAY HAVE DIFFERENT RATES THAT WERE SET AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND YOUR NEIGHBORING REGIONAL CENTERS SUCH AS WEST SIDE REGIONAL CENTER THAT HAVE HIGHER RATES. PROVIDERS ARE HARDER TO GO TO THAN WITHIN -- THE OTHER REGIONAL CENTER SO CONSIDERING ADDING AND STAYING IN ALIGNMENT WITH KIND OF THE INTENT OF THE LANGUAGE WITHIN A. B. X. TWO ONE ONE OF THE THINGS IS REALLY KIND OF ASSESSING. KIND OF OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM SO WHEN WE MOVE FORWARD A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE HAD A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL THAT WENT OUT -- IS A COMPETITIVE BID PROCESS BURNS AND ASSOCIATE WAS ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAD APPLIED -- BURNS AND ASSOCIATE HAS BEEN DOING -- RIGHT STUDIES AND A NUMBER OF STATES TEN STATES IN TOTAL SO BASED ON THEIR EXPERIENCE AND BASED ON THEIR PROPOSAL THAT WAIT THEY WERE SELECTED -- I DO HAVE STEVEN PULASKI WHOSE INTRODUCED HIMSELF WHO IS HERE TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS SHOULD ANY COME UP TODAY IN OUR DISCUSSION -- AGAIN JUST TO TO FOCUS THEN ON THE SCOPES OF OF OF THE RATE STUDY IT WAS REALLY ONLY LOOKING AT THOSE RATES WITH IN KIND OF THE DDS AT RATES THE STATUTE YOU KNOW NOT LOOKING AT THOSE THAT ARE LIKE THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY OR THOSE THAT ARE TIED. TO MEDI CAL SO WHEN YOU REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS UNDER THE SCOPE OF THE RATE STUDY THAT WAS CONSIDERED AND EVALUATED IT WAS REALLY ONLY SIXTY DIFFERENT SERVICE CODES -- WHICH ALSO REFLECTS ABOUT 90% OF OUR PURCHASE A SERVICE. WITH BURNS AND ASSOCIATES ASSISTANCE -- WE DID A NUMBER OF THINGS TO GATHER INFORMATION TO HELP INFORM THE STUDY. ONE OF WHICH WAS I'M GOING TO OUR PROVIDERS AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARE THE COSTS THAT ARE WITHIN THEIR EXISTING KIND OF SERVICE DELIVERY AND THAT'S IMPORTANT WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT ARE THOSE ELEMENTS WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT INFORM KIND OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING -- AS FAR AS SERVICE DELIVERY NUMBER OF HOURS FOR STAFFING WHAT AT THE WAGES WHAT ARE THEIR OVER TIME. NOW WE DO WANT -- TO BE AWARE THOUGH THAT THAT HAS ONLY ONE ELEMENT BECAUSE REALLY THE COST OF THOSE SERVICES IS OFTENTIMES REFLECTIVE OF WHAT THE RATE THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING. SO IT WASN'T A AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROCESS OF BEING INFORMED BUT ALSO THEN TAKING A LOOK AT PUBLISHED DATA THAT WOULD ALSO INFORM SO WHEN WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT BLS DATA FOR WAGES IN USING OTHER ELEMENTS THAT IS GOING TO AND THAT. INFORMED THE RATE MODELS WAS REALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS PROCESS ANOTHER PART OF IT WAS -- BEING CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF TAKING A LOOK AT HOW CAN WE BE TRANSPARENT NOT ONLY IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE RATE MODELS AND COMPLETING THE RATE STUDY. BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE MODELS IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE TRANSPARENT GOING FORWARD. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN BEING ABLE TO SEE WITH IN THE ELEMENTS OF THE RATE MODELS WHAT ARE THOSE PIECES SO BEING ABLE TO SEE WHAT'S THE STRUCTURE OF OF STAFF COMPENSATION FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS THE STRUCTURE THAN. FOR KIND OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE WHAT IS SO STRUCTURE FOR OPERATIONS AND SO SHOULD THERE BE TO DISCUSSIONS THAT NEEDED TO TAKE A LOOK AT A LITTLE BIT MORE GRANULAR. EVEN IN THE FUTURE SHOULD THE RATE -- MODELS BE IMPLEMENTED IT WOULD GET -- THE FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW TO ADDRESS SE WAGE ISSUES IN THE FUTURE SHOULD THAT BE A DISCUSSION THAT COULD OCCUR -- WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TOOK A LOOK AT KIND OF REGIONAL DIFFERENCES WHAT WERE THE THINGS THAT WERE INFLUENCING WEATHER IS WAGES HOUSING TRANSPORTATION COST WHAT WERE THOSE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND SO THE RATE STUDY ALSO REFLECTS THAT. AND WHAT IS REFLECTIVE IN IN THE MODELING THAT THAT WAS ULTIMATELY -- RELEASED IN THE RATE STUDY AND MARCH. OF THE PROCESS THAT WAS REALLY ALSO IMPORTANT WAS MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS THERE IS A NUMBER NUMBER OF DIFFERENT KIND OF VENUES IF YOU WILL. THAT ALLOWED FOR THAT DIALOGUE AND ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS ONE WAS WITHIN THE DS TASK FORCE AND HAVING A RATE STUDY WORK GROUP WHICH WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE INPUT IS. TO KIND OF HOW WE WOULD BE MOVING FORWARD BUT ALSO THAN GIVING US INFORMATION AS TO THE PROVIDER -- STUDY THAT WENT OUT -- SO THOSE THERE WAS A SERVICE PROVIDER STUDY THAT -- WE HAD -- RELEASED WE HAD -- EACH OF THE THE SAMPLINGS AT THE DIFFERENT IN SCOPE SERVICES THAT RESPONDED TO THAT -- PART OF THE DISCUSSION WITH THE DS TASK FORCE WAS ALSO ASKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE VERY AWARE OF IT AND I'M. MINDFUL OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO IS RECEIVING SERVICES CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES WHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO THEM. AND SO AS KIND OF MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT WHAT WE DID WAS WE WE WORKED WITH BURNS AND ASSOCIATE. THEY HAD A SUBCONTRACTOR HSR I WHO HAD THEN WORKED WITH SOME STAKEHOLDERS TO DESIGNED. ASUS A SURVEY OF CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES START HAVING SOME DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO THE SERVICE DELIVERY -- COMMON THEMES THAT WE HEARD THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO THE SERVICE DELIVERY FOR THEM WAS REALLY STAFF STABILITY EIGHT MAKING SURE THAT STAFF WERE TRAINED. MAKING SURE THAT THERE WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT HOW COULD THAT CAN HELP IMPROVE THE QUALITY. OF OF THAT SERVICE AND THAT EXPERIENCE FOR THAT PERSON -- ALL OF THAT INFORMATION HELPED INFORM ELEMENTS WITHIN THE RATE STUDY AND SO WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE RATE MODELS ARE CERTAIN ELEMENTS THAT ACTUALLY -- DO TOUCH ON MANY OF THOSE AREAS ONE IS WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE STAFF TRAINING THE RATE MODELS -- DO REFLECT ON COMPONENTS FOR REQUIREMENTS FOR STAFF TRAINING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IT ALSO INCLUDES -- DISCUSSION AS TO THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE STAFF TRAINING WOULD INCLUDE SOME CULTURAL COMPETENCY. AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE THAT WAS -- INCLUDED AND THAT WAS ADDRESSING THE UNDERSTANDING OF BILINGUAL STIPENDS YOU KNOW FOR ON THE COMMUNITIES THAT -- TO HAVE LANGUAGE ACCESS TO INCLUDE A SL. SO THOSE WERE SOME SOME PIECES THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE -- WITHIN THE CONSIDERATION O THE DEVELOPMENT OF OF THE MODELS -- WE ALSO WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE RECOGNIZE SEEN KIND OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SETTINGS SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT NEEDED -- TO INFORM US AND THAT IS WHERE HAVING FURTHER ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS WAS IMPORTANT. SO WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH A NUMBER OF THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AND ADVOCACY GROUPS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE POINTED CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO PARTICULAR SERVICE KIND OF CATEGORIES IF YOU WILL. THE OTHER THE OTHER PART THAT I THOUGHT WAS REALLY HELPFUL WAS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE OUR CONSULTANTS GO OUT AND VISIT PROGRAMS. THAT THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAMS AND OF OF THE WHOLE PICTURE OF IT ALL WE CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AND DO AN EVALUATION OF OUR SYSTEM. AND THE RATES IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS WITHIN STATUTE AND THEN WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE WITHIN REGULATION SO THERE WAS ALSO WE ALSO DID A FULL SCOPE REVIEW OF OUR REGULATIONS AND STATUTES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALSO BEING VERY MINDFUL OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS. SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT I DID WANT TO PROVIDE YOU KIND OF THAT. THAT -- REVIEW WE DID -- DO A RELEASE WE WE WALK THROUGH THE MODELS WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS WENT WITH TWO PRETTY IMPORTANT MEETINGS ONE ONE IN THE NORTH ONE IN THE SOUTH. AND THEN WE'RE STILL IN THE COMP WE WE HAVE THE COMMENTS FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THE INPUT FROM THE PARTICULAR GROUPS THAT HAVE SUBMITTED THEM. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING ALL OF THOSE COMMENTS. THERE'S A LOT OF THEM AND WE STILL NEED TO CONTINUE -- TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN BE INFORMED AS TO WHAT THAT TELLS US WITHIN THE EXISTING MODELS AND THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT THAT WERE PUT FORWARD. THANK YOU -- ACTUALLY BEFORE MOVEON MATES THAT AND AND DID YOU ANSWER IT OUR FINANCE ANSWERS SO UP SEE THAT MAY REVISED CAME OUT FROM THE GOVERNOR SO WHAT IS THE SO WE HAVE THE RACE TO THE OTHERS WERE HAVING HEARING ON IT RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS A PROPOSAL FOR THIS COMING YEAR IN REGARDS TO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THE RATE STUDY -- SO WHAT'S THE DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENTS PLAN -- HE MOVING FORWARD INTO FOR THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR -- THANK YOU SO IN THE MAY REVISED -- THE MAY REVISE DOES REFLECT THAN A PROPOSAL -- FOR FUNDING FOR HEAD OF A OF A RATE -- CONNECTS UP WOMAN TO OR THERE'S A DRESSING SOME RATE ISSUES IS VERY TARGETED. TARGETED INTO VERY SPECIFIC CATEGORIES SO IT'S WITH ARM LEVEL FOR ARM FACILITIES SO COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES ARM. IT IS WITH SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT SUPPORTED LIVING. FAMILY HOME AGENCY. AND AND SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORTS THAT ARE VERY SPECIFIC TO SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS ON KIND OF A ONE TO ONE BASIS AND THERE'S THREE SPECIFIC SERVICE CODES. PERSONAL ASSISTANCE SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT AND TRANSPORTATION ASSISTANT. AND SO LOOKING AT THOSE ALL OF THOSE HAVE KIND OF A A BROAD BRUSH WITHIN KIND OF THE SYSTEM AS FAR AS TAKING A LOOK AT KIND OF THOSE TARGETED AREAS. WE DO KNOW THAT WITHIN OUR RESIDENTIAL COULD COMMUNICATOR FACILITIES FOR ARM THAT IS THAT PARTICULAR. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IS HERE WERE SEEN THE DECLINE OF PROVIDERS. AS SO LOOKING AT SOME. PROBABLY TWO TO THREE KEY THINGS WE WANTED TO LOOK AT IN MOVING FORWARD WITH MAKING A MEANINGFUL. KIND OF INVESTMENT TO STABILIZE THEM REALLY CRITICAL ISSUES ONE IS THAT STABILIZING RESIDENTIAL. THE OTHER IS TAKING A LOOK AT HOW CAN WE SUPPORT COMPLIANCE WITH H. CBS. SO YOU HAVE YOUR PRESUMED -- SERVICES SUCH AS SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT SUPPORTED LIVING YOUR FAMILY HOME AGENCY IS ALIGNED WITH THE H. CBS -- AND TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN MOVE THOSE ISSUES FORWARD THE OTHER IS THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL AND SUPPORT SERVICES. THOSE ARE THE SERVICES THAT WE DO SEE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT KIND OF LOWER RATES THAT ARE HARDER FOR PER -- PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE. TO KIND OF GET TO HIRING THE STAFF THAT WOULD BE NEEDED SO THIS WOULD BE GETTING TO SOME WORK FORCE. STABILIZATION WITH AND THE INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORTS -- JUST TO TOOK. TAKE A SECOND LONGER IN LOOKING AT SOME OF THAT PERSONAL ASSISTANCE GOES INTO SUPPORT CENTER FAMILY HOMES IT CAN ALSO BE FIRST THE KIND OF IN CONJUNCTION WITH SUPPORT A LIVING. SO LOOKING AT KIND OF THAT BROAD BRUSH SO. IMPORTANT THEMES WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS IS SABILIZING SOME VERY TARGETED SERVICES THAT REALLY KEY TO SERVICE OF PORTS. THE OTHER IS COMPLIANCE WITH H. CBS MAKING SURE THAT WERE ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT INDIVIDUALS WITH SOME SIGNIFICANT NEEDS THAT NEED THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS. SO PROJECTED IS IS I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC DOLLARS IN FRONT OF ME I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS IT'S TWO HUNDRED MILLION. THAT WOULD BE GENERAL FUND IN APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION THAT WOULD BE TOTAL FUND. AND SO AS FAR AS THE OVERALL PLAN SO WE HAVE SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS KIND OF PHASED IN APPROACH OF SORTS ARE AMENABLE AS FAR AS THE OTHER AREAS DO YOU ANSWER. MORE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT OR IS THAT I MEAN HELP TO WHAT DEGREE ARE YOU LIKE -- WE'RE DOING THIS ARE WE'RE STILL DISCUSSING ABOUT HOW WE DO THIS I'M SURE PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO COMMENT ON THAT. NO ABSOLUTELY I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION IT IT REALLY IS TAKEN AS THE NEXT STEP TO A BROADER DISCUSSION AND SO USING THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE WHICH HAS REALLY BEEN KIND OF LIKE THAT -- THE KEY AND THAT THE HEART OF WORD MUCH OF THE CONVERSATIONS HAD BEEN HAD. SO OVER THE SUMMER BRING IN THE-GROUP BACK HAVING THAT BROADER SYSTEM DISCUSSION ON SOME TO PROBABLY. PRIMARY FOCUS DISCUSSIONS ONE IS KIND OF THE DIFF. THE SYSTEM AND THE COMPLEXITIES WE'RE GONNA HAVE A COMMENTS BACK WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE RATE STUDY. HAVE KIND OF THE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE ELEMENTS WE DO KNOW THAT OUR SYSTEM IS GROWING I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS WE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR GROWTH IT'S YOU KNOW. TWELVE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS NO WE WE KNOW THAT OUR EXPENDITURE GROWTH IS GOING YOU KNOW PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY A ON AN ANNUAL BASIS JUST BASED ON OUR OUR OUR SERVICE DELIVERY AS IT EXISTS TODAY. IS ABOUT 729% SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE THINGS SO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONSA SUMMER IN TOTALITY AS WELL AS TAKING A LOOK AT REALLY KIND OF THOSE THAT OVERSIGHT OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS. SERVICE SYSTEM TALKING ABOUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY THE OVERSIGHT TALKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THOSE THOSE OUTCOMES THAT ARE ARE TO SERVE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT -- WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR OKAY WELL WHEN WE GO AHEAD ANDMOVE ON TO OUR FIRST PANEL ON YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT THIS -- SO IF SANDERS SMITH -- CHAIR OF THE CITY COUNCIL DEVELOPMENT TO DISABILITIES AND THEN FOLLOWED BY ERIC SIGMUND HE'S A DOCTOR GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS TOWN. CENTER SMITH THE CHAIR STATE COUNCIL ENVELOPMENT DISABILITIES AND CONSTITUENT OF YOURS SENATOR PATH. THE THIRD THE COUNCIL'S IS THIRTY ONE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY FAMILY MEMBERS AN AGENCY WRAPS I AM THE PARENT OF A CHILD THIRTY SEVEN YEARS OLD THAT'S NOT TO STICK AND HAS EPILEPSY IN THIS NONVERBAL. THE PROVIDING FISCAL RELIEF FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS. ISN'T LIVED EVERY DAY BY PEOPLE RECEIVING SERVICES TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS AS PART OF THIS RATE STUDY WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO BE PART OF A STAKEHOLDERS WE ASK ELEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN OUR STATEWIDE NETWORK. THE SIMPLE QUESTION ARE YOU GETTING ALL THE SERVICES YOU NEED TO LIVE THE LIFE YOU WANT IN THE COMMUNITY. 65% OF RESPONDENTS SAID NOW THEN WE ASKED WHY. MANY SAID BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO FIND PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK FOR LOW PAY AND WHEN THEY FIND SOMEONE THAT'S PERSON LEAVES FOR BETTER PAYING JOB. WE PROVIDE ALL THESE RESPONSES TO THE COMMITTEE AND THEY HAVE THIS INFORMATION. THE STATUE STATES THAT THE RATES THAT HE SHALL ADDRESS THE SUSTAINABILITY QUALITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE COMMUNITY BASED SYSTEM THE RATES CITY IS LARGELY LARGELY TRANSPARENT WE PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH DEPARTMENT SUGGESTIONS. AND HOW TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY. AND LOOKING AT SUSTAINABILITY WE ASK THAT YOU LOOK AT HELD DIFFERENT PROVIDERS WOULD BE IMPACTED. THE MODEL AS COMPLEX AS THEM DIRECTOR SUGGESTED. AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WE HEAR THAT EXCELLENT PROVEN PROGRAMS LIKE SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT AND INFANT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WOULD RECEIVE A REDUCTION. THIS WOULD MOVES BACKWARDS WE ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER A HOLD HARMLESS SITUATION PROVISION THAT WAY PROVIDERS EITHER DO THE SAME OR BETTER UNDER THE NEW MODEL. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES WANT BETTER QUALITY SERVICES BETTER QUALITY COMES FROM INVESTING IN WORKFORCE WE ASK THAT YOU LOOK AT WAYS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE CHOOSING THESE TYPES OF JOBS AS CAREERS WE WANT THE SAME FOR PEOPLE FOR PEOPLE IN OUR LIVES DAY TO DAY. AND DAY AND OUT WE WANT PEOPLE WE CAN TRUST WHO CAN COME INTO OUR HOMES AND GET US UP IN THE MORNING WE ASK THAT THE RATES STEADY PROVIDE PATHWAYS TO BETTER PAY THROUGH TRAINING -- CREDENTIALING. ALSO CONSIDER FACTORING IN THE COMPLEXITY AND DIFFICULTY OF THE JOB THEMSELVES THE SENATE IS CONSIDERING THE RATE STUDY DURING A TIME WHEN THEY CAN PUSH FOR CHANGE. LIKE THE CHANGES OF THE AT AGE CBS REGULATIONS CONSIDER PROVIDING HIGHER RATES FOR SERVICES THAT MOVE THE SYSTEM FORWARD AND TO SIMPLY. DELIVERY WE PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY THE COMMITTEE A LIST OF VENDOR CODES THAT WOULD HELP TO THIS THE COUNCIL IS DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO THIS COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE FOR THE CONTINUED SUPPORT OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN AND SENATOR STONE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AMERICA EGGMAN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER -- REPRESENTING OUR COULD TODAY -- A REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE COMMENT ON THIS NG VITALLY IMPORTANT STUDY AND AND RATE SETTING -- RECOMMENDATIONS AND THANKS TO DDS AND THE LA -- FOR THEIR GREAT WORK ON THIS ISSUE ON THESE ISSUES. I'VE BEEN IN SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES FOR A FULL THIRTY YEARS NOW IN A CAREER THAT SPANNED EVERYTHING FROM DIRECT SERVICE AS A JOB COACH. TO LEADING PROVIDER AGENCIES AND NOW REGIONAL CENTER. IN MY EXPERIENCE THERE IS NO MORE IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP IN THE LANHAM ACT SERVICE SYSTEM IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PERSONS SERVING THE PERSON DIRECTLY SERVING THEM. ALL OUR PLANS FOR SERVICE DESIGNED QUALITY ASSURANCE MONITORING ACCOUNTABILITY DO NOT AMOUNT TO A HILL OF BEANS. IF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL AND THE INDIVIDUAL RECEIVING SERVICE SUPPORT IS NOT A QUALITY RELATIONSHIP THAT IS SUSTAINED -- CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME AND THE BEST WAY TO HAVE THAT SUSTAINING IS TO RECONNECT ACOSTA SERVICES WITH THE RATES PAID FOR SERVICES. SARCASM FIVE OVERALL -- THEMES WE'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER THE FIRST A SIMILAR TO THE LAST SPEAKERS. DO NO HARM IT SOUNDS SIMPLE BUT WITHOUT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE IMPACTS OF NEW RATES IN NEW RATE SETTING METHODOLOGY IS THE LOSS OF SERVICE OPTIONS. AND SPACES IN THE SHORT TERM SEEMS LIKELY AFTER DECADES OF UNDERFUNDING. TO ELIMINATE SERVICE OPTIONS WITHOUT INCUBATING A NEW SERVICE WITH DIVERSE AND SUSTAINABLE OPTIONS MAY LEAVE INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SERVICES. SECONDLY LET'S CHARTER PASSED PATH TO THE GREATEST GOOD WHEN IN AND OUT BURGER HAS STRONGER STARTING WAGES AND BENEFITS AND PROVIDER AGENCIES CAN OFFER THERE IS SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG WITH THE FUNDING METHODOLOGIES. WE ASK DIRECT SERVICE STAFF TO HOLD THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF AN INDIVIDUAL IN THEIR HANDS SOMETIMES LITERALLY. AND WE ARE ABLE TO COMPENSATE THEM LASSEN FLIPPING BURGERS. WE NEED TO BETTER RATE WE NEED BETTER RATES TO RECOGNIZE AND PROFESSIONAL LIVES WORKFORCE. THIRDLY -- LET'S TRY TO CREATE A REAL SUPPORT OPTIONS AND CHOICES THAT IS I INCLUDES INCREASED CAPACITY FLEXIBILITY AND INNOVATION. INTO THE NEW RATE SETTING METHODOLOGY THE POINT. THIS POINT HERE IS THE HEART OF WHAT IS BEST ABOUT THIS UNIQUE CIVIL RIGHTS HUMAN SERVICE LAW WE CALL THE LANHAM ACT REMOVING FLEXIBILITY TO MEET INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS WITH AN ARRAY OF SUPPORT OPTIONS STRIKES AT THE HEART OF OUR SYSTEM. FOURTH IN THIS DAY AND AGE WE MUST ENHANCE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY BUT LET TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE SERVICE SYSTEM RICHARD AND AVERSE TO RISKS AND INNOVATION. THE BURNS MODEL IS AT BASE A GOOD APPROACH IN THIS REGARD IT LETS EVERYONE SEE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE COSTS PERSONNEL OCCUPANCY TRAVEL LEADERSHIP PICKS THAT ARE -- THAT MAKE UP EACH RATE FOR EACH SERVICE. NOW THE BURDEN IS ON ALL OF US TO MAKE SURE THOSE BUILDING BLOCKS ARE SOUND AND THAT THE RATES STRUCTURES A REALISTIC AND SUSTAINABLE. AND OUR FIFTH AND FINAL TEN AND IS TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE AS WE CONSTRUCT THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOUNDATION OF OUR SYSTEM. MANY OF US HAVE HAD A FRONT ROW SEAT AND WATCHING THE EROSION OF OUR BRILLIANTLY CONCEIVED SYSTEM AS RATES HAVE STAGNATED AND THEN WORK DECIMATED IN THE GREAT RECESSION. MORE INDIVIDUAL IN FAMILIES ARE UNDERSERVED. A SMALLER ARRAY OF OPTIONS OF NEEDED SERVICES EXISTENCE SOMETIMES NO SERVICES EXIST AT ALL ESPECIALLY IN HIGH COST AREAS. THAT WE KNOW CAN HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE TRAJECTORY OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE. IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR TAKING SERIOUSLY RATE REFORM THIS EFFORT. I BELIEVE AND WE BELIEVE WILL IN LARGE MEASURE DETERMINE WHAT KIND F FUTURE THOSE WE SERVE WILL HAVE. IN THE STATE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS -- NO WE'RE GONNA BRING UP -- ANOTHER PANEL THERE'S FOUR SO WE HAVE TO MOVE PEOPLE AROUND SO WE CAN -- HAVE FOR SEATED THERE -- SO -- WILL BRING UP -- REBEKAH LENARD WITH THE TIER OF THE SOUL FOUNDATION -- DOCTOR DIANE CLAY WITH PROFESSIONAL CHILD DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATES RULE WITH PATH POINT AND JACQUI DILLARD FOSS BUT STEP THE CORPORATE. SO NEED FOR SEATS THERE. RIGHT THERE. OKAY. SEVEN AND ASK IF YOU CAN THE CHECK KEEP REMARKS TWO WITHIN THREE MINUTES APPRECIATED SO. RIGHT SO WE'LL GO AHEAD SPENT START WITH MS LEONARD. WELCOME. GREAT THANK YOU. MY NAME IS REBECCA LINE HARD AND I'M CO THE TIERED ALSO FOUNDATION WE PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES FOR APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN AND WOMEN SERVED ACROSS LOS ANGELES COUNTY. I ALSO SERVICE CO CHAIR OF THE LOS ANGELES COALITION OF SERVICE PROVIDERS. WHICH COLLECTIVELY SERVICE MORE THAN TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE NEARLY ACROSS NEARLY ALL AGES AND SERVICE NEEDS. OUR SERVICES COVER INFANTS TO AGING ADULTS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO GROUP HOMES SOARED SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT SUPPORTED LIVING ADULT DAY SERVICES AND SO FORTH. THE L. O. CO LA COALITION EMPLOYEES OVER SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES TO DELIVER THIS WIDE ARRAY OF INNOVATIVE AND UNIQUE SERVICES. AND IN DOING SO WE INTERACT WITH TWELVE WITH THE TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE INDIVIDUAL SERVICE PLANS BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL PLANNING PROCESS. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE RATE STUDY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS -- TO DIRECTLY SERVE PEOPLE AND WITH HIM OUR STATE REALIZE. TO MEET ITS STATUTORY AND ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES TO PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES -- I WE HAVE BASICALLY THREE OVER ARCHING -- AREAS THAT WE'D LIKE TO DRAW ATTENTION -- TO MAINLY IT'S THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED WITH IN THE STUDY AND THAT THOSE ASSUMPTIONS NEED TO BE FULLY. THAT IT BEFORE ADOPTED WE HAVE PROVIDED A SIXTY FIVE PAGE RESPONSE -- TO THE DEPARTMENT INTO BURNS AND ASSOCIATES. FOR A CONSIDERATION. OUR FIRST AND MOST EGREGIOUS ASSUMPTION IN THE STUDY THAT WE BELIEVE IS THE D. S. P. WAGE -- RATE -- AND THE B. S. I'LL BE LS DOT AND WHICH WAS DEVELOPED. MORE THAN 80% OF ALL THE FUNDING -- THAT WE HAVE IS DEVOTED TO IMPLANT A WORK FORCE TO PROVIDE MANAGING COORDINATE DIRECT SUPPORT -- FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES THEY'RE FORGETTING THIS ASSUMPTION RIGHT AT THE START MUST BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF ALL WE DO. CURRENTLY THE RATE STUDY BILLS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM ACROSS CALIFORNIA. ON BASICALLY -- FOR A LEVEL EXPECTATIONS FOR PEOPLE'S LIVES FAR EXCEED THIS BASIC CUSTODIAL CARE. IN THE SETTINGS RULE ITSELF IT STATES THAT WE SHOULD PROVIDE ELIGIBLE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES FULL ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS OF COMMUNITY LIVING AND OFFER THEM A LONG TERM SUPPORT SERVICES IN THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING OF THEIR CHOOSING. THE LETTERMAN ACT ITSELF STATES PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE A RIGHT TO GET SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THE NEED TO LIVE LIKE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE DISABILITIES. IF THE RATES OF REIMBURSEMENT ARE SENATE TOILETING BEATING AND FEEDING THEN WE MUST ASK OURSELVES IF THE END RESULT WILL BE TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT WILL ONLY SPEED AND WAREHOUSE PEOPLE. RATHER THAN A INNOVATIVE AND NIBBLED NETWORK OF SUPPORTS AND SERVICES DESIGNED TO FOSTER INDEPENDENCE INCREASE AND EMPLOYABILITY. THE LA COALITION HAS PROVIDED AN ALTERNATIVE D. S. P. WAGE BASED ON DEALS BLS DATA. THAT MIRRORS THE DUTIES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THIS WORK FORCE WHO GOT. DONE. YES WITH THAT TWO MINUTES YOUR THREE MINUTES AFTER THREE MINUTES NOW OKAY. RIGHT. THAT WAS OUR MOST EGREGIOUS ONE SAID THE DS AT THE D. S. P. WAGES IF WE CAN FOCUS ON THAT. OKAY YET TO OTHER I DID HE JUST SAY WHAT THEY ARE REGULARLY AND YOU HAVE THREE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS ANYTIME ON THAT. NATION OF SERVICE CATEGORIES -- IS REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT -- TO FOR OUR COALITION ALONE IT WILL BE ELIMINATION OF MANY. AND AGAIN -- BACK TO WHAT IS ALREADY BEEN SAID AND THAT IS TAKE TIME TO FULLY THAT THE STUDY BEFORE -- ANY HARM COMPRISED OF THE PERSONAL SUPPORT OF SUPPORTED LIVING INDEPENDENT LIVING AND RESPITE. THESE SERVICES COMPRISE OF MORE THAN 55% OF TH DDS CASELOAD AND WE KIND OF GAVE YOU THAT DOCUMENT DIRECTLY FROM THE FACT SHEET FROM DDS. WE BELIEVE THE WORK CONDUCTED BY BURGE ASSOCIATE AND DEVELOPING RATE TO SOUND AND THE PROCESS STRIVE TO DEVELOP TRANSPARENT RATE STRUCTURES WHAT WE BELIEVE A CRITICAL ASPECT OF ALL OF THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RATES. IS THE POLICY DECISIONS ON HOW WE GUIDE OURSELVES AND WE ENACT THESE RATES CALIFORNIA IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO SEIZE THE MOMENT OF THIS STUDY AND USE THIS NEW STRUCTURE. NOT JUST TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO BUT TO BUILD A SYSTEM THAT EMPHASIZES VALUES AND INDIVIDUAL OUTCOMES AND CHOICE. HOW THESE MODELS ARE IMPLEMENTED WILL BE INDICATIVE OF THE KIND OF CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO HAVE FOR A FUTURE? NATIONALLY COLLECTED DATA SHOWS THAT INDEPENDENT LIVING AND SUPPORTIVE LIVING SERVICES HAVE BEEN INCREASING 3%. ACROSS ALL STATES. THIS IS BEEN OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THESE ARE THE CHOSEN PROGRAMS WE APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION OF THAT AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. BUT WE DO AGREE WITH THE BLS DATA AROUND INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES WE HAVE THE SUBMITTED COMMENTS IN REGARDS TO THAT. AND WE NEED TO WORK WITH BURKE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS MORE WE ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT PART OF THAT CONTINUUM IS RESPITE. AND INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES THESE PROGRAMS WORK HAND IN HAND FROM CHILD TO THOSE WHO MAY NOT NEED AS MUCH SUPPORT ALL OF THESE ARE H. CBS COMPLIANT PROGRAMS. RESPITE ADMIN RATE WAS REMOVED IN A AN EMPLOYER OF RECORD AND THAT SHOULD BE BACK AND THE OTHER THING IS -- WE DID READ THE LA OWES -- INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO SUPPORT A LIVING SERVICES WE DO BELIEVE THAT MOVING FOR WITH AN HOURLY RATE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES HAS ALREADY DONE SO WITH -- SAN ANDREAS REGIONAL CENTER GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER AND ALL TO CALIFORNIA REGIONAL CENTER IN NORTH BAY AUDITOR'S DO NOT LIKE. RATES THAT ARE NOT HOURLY WE ARE ACCESS WE WERE TOLD ACCESS TO GENERIC RESOURCE I HSS THAT IS HOURLY AND YET WE HAVE COMPLETE COMPLICATED CONVOLUTED RATE STRUCTURES. AT HOURLY RATE SEEMS TO BE THE RATE THAT NEEDS TO BE HAPPENING SO WE APPRECIATE THAT THAT WAS RECOMMENDED AND THE BIRDS AND ASSOCIATES -- I THINK THAT PART OF THIS IS ALSO. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAID CALIFORNIA SICK I'VE BEEN TALKING TO YOU AS A DOCTOR WE ARE SICK LET'S DO RATE STUDY. SO YOU HAD A RATE STUDY DONE YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN A PRESCRIPTION. THE QUESTION IS IS ARE YOU TO FILL THE PRESCRIPTION OR WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO IGNORE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WE ARE DOING A DROP SMALL STEP FORWARD WE ALL HAVE ISSUES AROUND HOW WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WE'VE GOT TO MOVE FORWARD. YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE THIS DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS FORWARD THIS RATE IS IT ACCEPTABLE IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE IS IT BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE WHICH IS A PATHETIC THING FOR US ALL SAY. AND I THINK MY DIRECT SUPPORT WILL ASK YOU TODAY IS THAT MY WORTH AND I SEE THE TIME OUTSIDE YOU LEARN SOME SIGN LANGUAGE THAT'S VERY GOOD. SO THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] PRACTICING. WELCOME RIGHT THANK YOU I ABOUT THREE MINUTES TALK ABOUT DAY EMPLOYMENT TRANSPORTATION SO AGO QUICK I APPRECIATE THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN THE STUDY WE'RE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE COMMENTS FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS THEN GET INCLUDED BEFORE WENT TWO YEARS SO WE'RE GOING TO SHARE SOME OF THOSE WITH. YOU SO ONE DAY PROGRAMS A FEW QUICK THINGS COMPLEXITY THE STUDY IS BIKE WERE RUNNING -- WORKING ON A BASEBALL FIELD NOW AND NOW IT'S A CRICKET MATCH SO IT'S SAYING FEEL THE LOOKS SIMILAR THE RULES ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SO QUICK EXAMPLE I USED TO HAVE SOMEONE COME RIGHT PROGRAM THAT WE HAD ONE RATE FOR SIX HOURS NOW THE SAME PERSON COMES. I RATE FOR THE FOUR HOURS THERE WITH US I HAVE A DIFFERENT RATE FOR THE TWO HOURS THEY GO IN THE COMMUNITY I HAVE A ONE ON ONE AID FOR MEALS WITH THE NEW RATE I HAVE A A BEHAVIORAL EIGHT FOR TWO HOURS WITH THE NEW RATE. IT'S GOOD STUFF BUT BOY IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO LAYER ALL THE STUFF IN TO REDO INDIVIDUAL PLANS FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON. FIGURE OUT THE SYSTEMS TO MAKE THAT WORK SECOND WE HAVE A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL ASSUMPTIONS WITHIN CURRENT CORRECT THEY HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED PAGES OF NOTES FOR YOU. ON THAT THE WILL PASS NOT TWENTY ONE HUNDRED PAGES LIKE THE RATE STUDY BUT WE'RE GETTING THERE THERE'S A MISSING SERVICES THAT REBEKAH TOUCHED ON PROJECTS SEARCHES AND IN THERE. WE HAVE A LOT O PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND ONE TO FOUR RATIO IS THAT'S NO LONGER ALLOWED WE THINK THAT NEEDS TO GET FIXED AND THEN THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH A PROGRAMS IS THE RATE FOR THE DSP. THAT WERE BACK I GOT INTO THIS BUT THE INDIVIDUAL THE IT'S A PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH TO THE RATE STUDY SAYS WE'RE ABOUT TO STUDIO CARE FOR ABOUT FEEDING PEOPLE HOUSING PEOPLE AND JUST TAKING CARE THEIR BASIC NEEDS WE AS PROVIDERS WOULD SAY WE'RE ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE BECOME IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH OUR VISION IS THAT OUR APPROACH LEADS TO LESS NEED FOR STATE SUPPORT ON AN ONGOING BASIS BECAUSE PEOPLE MOVING TO INDEPENDENCE AND PLAY BILLION PLAYING TAXES. THE RATE STUDY PUSHES US OUT A MODEL JUST ONGOING CUSTODIAL CARE FOR FOR KIND EVER MORE -- IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT. ARE WE LIKE THAT THEIR RATES FOR JOB DEVELOPMENT IN THERE. THERE ARE SOME REAL ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE WRONG SO WE'RE SAYING CALIFORNIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT FOR STATE BUT RIGHT NOW THE NEW RATE PROPOSES LOWER. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE LESS RESOURCES FOR THIS BUT THERE IF IT'S BECAUSE THEIR ASSUMPTIONS THE WRONG SO TOO QUICK ASSUMPTIONS ONE IS THAT THEY DO INCLUDE ANY SUPERVISION EVERY SERVICE NEED SUPERVISION EVERYTHING ELSE INCLUDED IT IT MUST OF BEEN AN OVERSIGHT THE SECOND IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE REQUIRES. A REST BREAKS UNINTERRUPTED REST BREAK SMALL THING IT'S NOT IN THE STUDY WE HAVE TO DO THOSE BY LAW CHANGE THOSE TWO THINGS THE RATE GOES UP 17%. SOME OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE WRONG THEY'VE ELEVEN MINUTES PER DAY TRAVEL TIME WE REQUIRE IT'S A LOT MORE IN REALITY. THE DSP WAGES WRONG ADMINISTRATION SHOULD HAVE BEN CUT 212% FIX ALL THOSE PROBLEMS THE RATE GOES UP 69% SO THERE ARE SOME REAL THINGS THEY CAN ADJUST THESE RATES THAT NEED TO GET FACTORED IN IN THE COMMENTS AND HOPEFULLY DDS WILL ISSUE A NEW. REVISED VERSION OF THAT AND THEN LASTLY QUICKLY ON TRANSPORTATION. I TALKED TO A PROVIDER WHO WHO DOES THIS HE SAYS THEY PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION FOR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE THE NEW RATES WILL CAUSE THEM TO LOSE ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY JUST ON TRANSPORTATION. THEY WOULD STOP ALL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND WE'VE HEARD THAT ANECDOTALLY FROM A LOT OF OTHERS SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT NEED TO GET LOOKED AT IN THE TRANSPORTATION FILTER. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS THAT. THERE YOU GO GOOD AFTERNOONMY NAME IS DOCTOR DIANE COLONNE NOW I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON. I'M A PEDIATRICIAN WITH THE SUB SPECIALTY AND NARROW DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN WITH THE PROPOSED CHANGES SPECIFICALLY TO EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICE CODE -- EIGHT OH FIVE PER WHICH PROVIDE SERVICES TO CHILDREN FROM BIRTH TO THIRTY SIX MONTHS EITHER AT HOME OR IN A CENTER BASED PROGRAM. JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND ABOUT ME I DID MY INTERNSHIP AND RESIDENCY AT KAISER FELLOWSHIP AT UCLA I WORKED IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS INCLUDING CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND PARTICULARLY AS A PHYSICIAN WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER -- I'M NOW AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A NONPROFIT AGENCY THAT PROVIDES SERVICES TO CHILDREN BIRTH THROUGH TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE. AND WE DO HAVE AN EIGHT OH FIVE EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM THAT WE'VE HAD FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS. SO HAVE A LOT OF YEARS IN THIS FIELD. OVER THE YEARS -- BEST PRACTICES FOR EARLY INTERVENTION HAVE BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED ESPECIALLY THE PRACTICE OF INTERDISCIPLINARY WORK. OVER TIME DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING CHANGES IN ELIGIBILITY OF OTHER PEOPLE OF ALLUDED. TO MANY EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS OF HAD TO CLOSE. NOW THE PROPOSED RATE STRUCTURE I BELIEVE IS ANOTHER THREAT TO EARLY INTERVENTION. IT PROPOSES PROPOSES TO DIVIDE FUNDING INTO SEPARATE SERVICES. INSTEAD OF ONE EIGHT OH FIVE WE WOULD NOW HAVE EARLY INTERVENTION TEACHERS A RATE FOR SUPERVISORS AND ONE FOR EACH TYPE OF SPECIALIST IN ADDITION IT WOULD BE FURTHER DIVIDED BY THE RATIO. OF ONE TO ONE ONE TWO TWO OR ONE TO THREE JUST AS AN EXAMPLE IN OUR EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM OUR TEAM INCLUDES. DEVELOPMENTAL INTERVENTIONIST AT THE BACHELOR'S LEVEL THE MASTERS LEVEL LICENSED PROFESSIONALS FROM. SPEECH LANGUAGE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ART THERAPY MUSIC THERAPY PSYCHOLOGY MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPY SOCIAL WORK DIETITIANS NURSING AND MYSELF IN PEDIATRICS. OUR STAFF WORK AS A TEAM WE PROVIDE THE CURRICULUM WE ADDRESS ISSUES WITH FROM EACH DISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE AS THEY OCCUR. ALL OF THE TEAM MEMBERS PLAN TRAIN WORK TOGETHER CREATED COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING TREATMENT PLAN AND REPORT FOR EACH CHILD AND FAMILY. IMAGINE THAT FOR EACH CHILD INSTEAD OF FUNDING A PROGRAM THERE WOULD BE SEPARATE PRE AUTHORIZATIONS AND BILLING FOR EACH OF THE DISCIPLINES INVOLVED. WHICH LEADS TO SEPARATE TREATMENT PLANS IN SEPARATE REPORTS THIS DOES NOT WORK ON A PRACTICAL ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL. IN IT TRULY UNDERMINES THE CONCEPT OF INTER DISCIPLINARY SERVICES. SO IN CONCLUSION WE ALL KNOW EARLY INTERVENTION CAN CHANGE LIVES I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT EIGHT OH FIVE SERVICE REMAIN AS ONE UNIT. FULLY FUNDED. AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE'VE GAINED OVER THIRTY YEARS. WE KNOW HOW TO PROVIDE QUALITY COMPREHENSIVE INTERVENTION IN IN -- JUST INTERDISCIPLINARY SERVICES OKAY. THANK YOU. I SHOULD MENTION. CHRISTIAN TRAIN BUS AND CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BEAVER DEVELOPMENT THANK YOU. A LITTLE HOSPITAL IN BOSTON -- ANYWAY ALL RIGHT -- SO -- WE'RE GONNA. LET'S MOVE ON TO KALLIO YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION AS WELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS AND SO NAY PADDOCK FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST' OFFICE AND YOU SHOULD HAVE A HANDOUT THAT WILL ACCOMPANY MY REMARKS AND I I DON'T INTEND TO HIT EVERY POINT IN THIS HANDOUT IT'S MORE FOR YOUR REFERENCE I'M JUST GONNA HIT SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS -- WE WERE ASKED BY A BULLS THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL AS THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB SUB SUB COMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES -- TO REVIEW THE RATE STUDY AND PROVIDE SOME OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER ABOUT WAYS TO BEGIN. IMPLEMENTING A RATE REFORM IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY SO -- IN MY TALK I'M JUST GOING TO ADDRESS THEM. AS THE TWO OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED THEN TALK ABOUT SOME OTHER WAYS THAT YOU COULD PROVIDE PHYSICAL RELIEF -- IN THE COMING FISCAL YEAR IN COMBINATION WITH -- BEGINNING RATE REFORM AND THEN TALK ABOUT SOME OTHER HIGH LEVEL CONSIDERATIONS SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT. I THINK I'D I'D LIKE TO START BY FIRST EMPHASIZING THAT THREE STUDY REALLY PRESENTS A REAL OPPORTUNITY -- TO TAKE SUBSTANTIVE ACTION. IN -- TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AS HAS BEEN EVIDENCED BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS AND AS WE ARE ALL AWARE THE SYSTEM IS IN NEED OF REFORM THE THE CURRENT RATE SETTING PROCESS IS SOMEWHAT. OF A CONVOLUTED AND THE RATE STUDY. THE RATE MODELS RATHER THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THE RATE STUDY THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY BURNS AND ASSOCIATES -- ARE BOTH A TRANSPARENT AND LOGICAL. THEY'RE ALSO RELATIVELY EASY TO UPDATE -- ON A REGULAR BASIS -- YOU COULD ALSO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEM BEFORE YOU EVEN BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT THEM -- YOU KNOW REFLECTING SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT THE PANELISTS TALKED TALKED ABOUT EARLIER -- AND THEY ALSO ARE PROVIDE MORE EQUITY ACROSS. A SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO HAVE SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS. WE WOULD -- ENCOURAGE THOSE THE LEGISLATURE TO DO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TO BEGIN RATE REFORM -- THERE OBVIOUSLY SOME FISCAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRAINTS THAT WOULD MAKE THIS DIFFICULT IF YOU WERE TO IMPLEMENT THE STUDY FULLY AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY IT WOULD BE ONE POINT. NINE BILLION DOLLARS OVER WITH THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN JANUARY ONE POINT TWO BILLION GENERAL FUND -- THERE ALSO A NUMBER OF IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRAINTS THAT HAVE BEEN -- SORT OF TOUCHED UPON ALREADY NEVER THE LESS WE THINK THIS REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY ON THERE'S A LOT OF SORT OF MOMENTUM FOR THIS RIGHT NOW -- AND THE SO TO THAT END I'M GOING TO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE FIRST OPTION -- THAT WE PROPOSE FOR CALLING THIS IS STAGED ROLLOUT THIS IS ESSENTIALLY LIKE PHASING IN RATE MODELS IN CERTAIN SERVICE CATEGORIES -- BASED ON OUR LIMITED UNDERSTANDING SO FAR OF WHAT'S PROPOSED IN THE MAIN REVISION -- THIS IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSING TO DO THERE I I BELIEVE PROPOSING SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS BUT USING THE CURRENT STATUS QUO RATE SETTING STRUCTURE -- WHERE IS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS? TO ACTUALLY START ROLLING OUT THE PROPOSED RATE MODELS IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND IN SOME OF THE SELECT SERVICE CATEGORIES. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE -- FOUR WE PRESENT. FOR SERVICE CATEGORIES THAT -- BASED ON OUR REVIEW WE FOUND WOULD BE AMONG THOSE THAT WOULD -- THE MOST FEASIBLE TO IMPLEMENT IN THE COMING FISCAL YEAR -- THEY DON'T. REQUIRE A LOT OF CHANGES TO THE ACTUAL SERVICE PROVIDED PROVIDED OR THE WAY THAT THE SERVICES BUILD -- AND THEY ALSO ARE RATE MODELS THAT PROBABLY REQUIRE AS THE LEAST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE INPUTS GOING INTO THE MODELS THERE MAY BE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THAT SUCH AS INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES AS WE JUST DISCUSSED THERE MAY BE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAGES OPTIONS THAT GO INTO THAT. I'M ON PAGE FIVE OURS THE SECOND OPTION THAT WE'RE SUGGESTING -- COULD BE CONSIDERED IS CONDUCTING A STAGE ROLL OUT AS I JUST DESCRIBED BUT PACKAGING IT WITH PILOT PROJECTS IN SOME OF THE SERVICE CATEGORIES -- THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE STAGE FOR ALL OUT TO TEST SOME OF THESE -- ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTATION -- SO IT TO THAT END WE WE SUGGESTS THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO TO WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A PILOT PROJECT APPROACH. THAT IT DO SO IN SORT OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF REGIONAL CENTERS MAYBE THREE TO REPRESENT THE DIFFERENT COST AREAS AND MAYBE WITH JUST A SMALL HANDFUL OF PROVIDERS IN -- EACH OF THE VARIOUS SERVICE CATEGORIES IN THE IDEA HERE REALLY WOULD BE TO TO TAKE SOME OFTHESE TRICKIER CATEGORIES LIKE DAY PROGRAMS INFANT DEVELOPMENT. AND SEE HOW THE RATE MODELS WOULD PLAY OUT IN THOSE CATEGORIES AND IT WOULD PROVIDE A LOT OF ABSURD BEST PRACTICES AND LESSONS LEARNED BEFORE ROLLING OUT THE THE RATE MODELS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS -- I SHOULD JUST MENTION TOO THAT WITH PILOT PROJECTS THE LEGISLATURE COULD REALLY DECIDE HOW MUCH IT WANTS TO SPEND IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE A HUGE AMOUNT. THE DEPARTMENT COULD DESIGN THE PILOT PROJECTS BASED ON THE AMOUNT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO SPEND. IF YOU TURNED OUT TO PAGE SEVEN I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE A LIST OF SOME OF THE OPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED EITHER -- BY MEMBERS ADVOCATES EVEN ALL OUR OFFICE. FOR LEASE THAT -- YOU COULD PROVIDE SOME FISCAL RELIEF UNDER THE STATUS QUO RATE SETTING FRAMEWORK. AS YOU DID MAYBE THE STAGE TO ROLL OUT -- OF OF RICK MODELS SO A COUPLE OF THESE HAVE TO DO WITH -- EITHER STATE STATE AND OR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE ISSUES THREE OF THEM HAVE TO DO WITH RESTORING. OF FUNDING THAT WAS CUT DURING THE RECESSION AND THEN THE LAST ONE WOULD BE AN ACROSS THE BOARD RATE INCREASE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY BOTH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL. AS ADVOCATES -- THERE CERTAINLY SOME PROS AND CONS TO THIS APPROACH FOR EXAMPLE IT WOULD BE VERY ADMINISTRATIVELY SIMPLE TO ADMINISTER THE SAME TIME IT MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST COST EFFICIENT WAY TO YOU KNOW SOME PROVIDERS MIGHT NEED. RATE INCREASES MORE THAN OTHERS -- ADDITIONALLY -- ONE CAUTIONARY NOTE ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT -- PROVIDERS WHO RECEIVE A RATE INCREASE HUNDRED ACROSS THE BOARD APPROACH COULD THEN BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY FACE A RATE REDUCTION ONCE THE RATE MODEL IS IMPLEMENTED IN THAT SERVICE CATEGORY IN THE FUTURE. PAGE EIGHT SPREAD JUST PROVIDES THE ESTIMATED TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY COSTS FOR EACH OF THOSE OPTIONS AND THEN THE TABLE ON PAGE NINE PROVIDES THE GENERAL FUND COST. IF YOU WERE TO PACKAGE SOME OF THOSE OPTIONS WITH THE STAGE ROLL OUT OF THE RATE MODELS. AND THERE'S A LOT OF FIGURES THERE BUT REALLY THE TAKE AWAY IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT. OPTIONS AND APPROACHES THAT IT COULD TAKE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH IT WANTS. TO SPEND ON RATE REFORM IN THE IN THE UP COMING FISCAL YEAR. I AM SO I WILL JUST CONCLUDE IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TEN WITH SOME HIGH LEVEL CONSIDERATIONS. WE DID MENTION AT THE BEGINNING OF BETTER I'VE MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS TALK THAT. THERE'S SOME REAL BENEFITS TO THE RATE MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY BURNS AND ASSOCIATES. THEY'RE MAYBE ALSO SOME POTENTIAL TRADE OFFS AND JUST A COUPLE I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT -- THE PROPOSED THREE MODELS DO NOT CURRENTLY -- CONSIDER LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES SPECIFICALLY MEAN THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD EASILY CHANGE THAT WHICH IS ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THE RATE MODELS IS THAT THEY CAN BE UPDATED AND CHANGED THE THE INPUTS ARE DON'T HAVE TO BE STATIC. AND THEN -- AS OUR EARLIER PANELISTS MENTIONED THERE ARE RATE MODELS IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES THAT MAY LEAD TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND ONE EXAMPLE IS IN THE EARLY START AREA -- THAT MIGHT BE ONE THAT NEEDS ADDITIONAL DELIBERATION -- FINALLY I WOULD MENTION AS WE STATED LAST WEEK AT THE HEARING -- WE THINK IT'LL BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ABOUT WHICH SERVICES IT. BELIEVES WILL AND WILL NOT BE COMPLIANT WITH THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES RULE THAT TAKES EFFECT IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND HOW THE INTEND TO USE. RATE MODELS TO REFLECT THE THE DEPARTMENTS PRIORITIES -- AND WITH THAT AND HAVE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU -- ACTUALLY COMES FOR FINANCE. CHRIS COOK FINANCE SO. WELL THE ADMINISTRATION AGREES THAT YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS A NEED IN THIS AREA THAT THE MAYOR VISION DOES REFLECT. THAT -- INVESTMENT IN THOSE SERVICE AREAS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED TO HAVE THOSE NEEDS. AND TO STABILIZE THOSE AND AND AND THEN AGREES THAT ADDS THAT THIS POINT IN THE SUMMER THERE'S OPPORTUNITY. FOR A BROADER CONVERSATION ON WHAT THIS THAT THE RATES WOULD LOOK LIKE MOVING FORWARD SO THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES A MODEST INVESTMENT. AND AS NOTED BY THE DIRECTOR OF EARLIER -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INVESTMENTS IN AN AREA THAT HIS SISTER IS GROWN SUBSTANTIALLY YEAR OVER YEAR. AND SO THIS ALLOWS US TO HAVE THAT BROADER LOOK MOVING FORWARD AND TO REALLY EXAMINE THE RATE STUDY AND MAKE AND MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS. TO THE ALEJO'S -- SUGGEST INVESTMENTS OF ACROSS THE BOARD -- IN ADDITION AS POINTED OUT IN THE ALLEY OWES AYE DOCUMENTS THERE IS ALSO AN INVESTMENT IN THE MAYOR VISION -- SIMILAR -- TO RECOMMENDED BY DAILY -- WHICH IS TO A SUSPEND THAT UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE AS WELL OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. THE QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS A CENTER STONE. THANK YOU TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE CAN JUST FOLLOW UP ON YOUR COMMENT YOU YOU MENTIONED IN THE AND THEN THE MADE THE GOVERNOR'S REVISE IT IT'S UP A MODEST INVESTMENT -- AND I AGREED TO IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY MODEST INVESTMENT IS -- LAST YEAR AND GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES WERE TWENTY FIVE MILLION AND THIS YEAR ACCORDING YOUR BUDGET IS TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOUBLE THE DAUGHTER OF A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- WITH THE COST OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION IF WE ARE ACTUALLY -- BRING SERVICES -- TO PARK -- BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT THE LA -- WAS GIVEN SO. I'VE LEARNED IN. TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF BEING IN THIS BUSINESS OF ELECTED OFFICIAL THE TRIP BUDGET REALLY WERE FRACTURE. YOUR PRIORITIES IN YOUR VALUES AND I'M OF THE OPINION. AS WELL AS A MAJORITY OF THE SENATE. ACTUALLY AS COMPACT AS CUT EVENLY -- SPLIT [inaudible] THAT. THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR US-[inaudible] AND WHY ISN'T IT A HIGHER PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR WHEN YOU HAVE. PEOPLE THAT NEED SERVICES THAT UNFORTUNATELY CAN'T THE AFFORD A LOT OF GOLD PLATED. BELT BUCKLE LOBBYIST TO COME HERE AND AND FIGHT FOR THEM. BUT THESE ARE THE THE PEOPLE THAT NEED OUR SERVICES. PROBABLY THE MOST. YOU KNOW I'VE WE HAVE A WONDERFUL NEW COLLEAGUE US. SENATOR HER COTTO THIS HERE -- HER DISTRICTS PROBABLY ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT. AND NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO GET. CONTRACTORS TO TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PRECIOUS PEOPLE WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] SO -- I MEAN I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING SOME OF THESE -- PROPOSALS. BUT YOU KNOW I WOULD URGE THE GOVERNOR TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK. AT THIS PRIORITY AMONGST THE MANY PRIORITIES SAID HE'S HE'S WHERE. AND I'M HOPING [inaudible] THAT HE HE RECONSIDERS MARTIN'S. PROVIDING ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO PEOPLE. MY MY REGIONAL CENTER. THEY'RE LOSING CONTRACTORS. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T CONTINUE TO PAY THESE RATES. SO YOU KNOW WHAT I APPRECIATE A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. WHICH IS ABOUT 10% OF WHAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO BRING THE RATES UP. AND I'VE HEARD THIS EXCUSE IN GOVERNMENT NOW 427- YEARS OLD WE GOT TO STUDY SOME MORE. WE STUDY EVERYTHING TO DEATH. IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE TO SUFFER. AND SO I THINK IS A VERY. ACTUALLY I CANNOT ALLOW WE CANNOT HAVE ANY VERBAL WE CAN NO CLAPPING AND CHEERING YOU CAN DO THIS. OKAY GOOD ALL RIGHT THAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS OF FLAWS IN SIGN LANGUAGE. YOU CAN DO THIS BUT THAT'S SORRY NO -- NO CLAPPING HISSING DOING ANYTHING LIKE THAT. ALL RIGHT. I THINK WE LET LAUGHTER GO BY THERE IS. THE CONTINUE ON I I DON'T ME BE OVER PASSIONATE. BUT TO ME THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IF NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT -- LEGISLATIVE BUDGET. ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING BECAUSE WE'RE SETTING THE STAGE FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO TREAT THIS FORMAL POPULATION IN THE FUTURE. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN SAY THAT THIS CAN'T BE A HIGHER PRIORITY WITH TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IN ANTICIPATED REVENUE COMING INTO THE STATE -- TO ME IT'S GOING TO REALLY DEFINE -- THE GOVERNOR'S -- CARE. AND CONCERN. FOR PEOPLE THAT. DIDN'T GET A FAIR SHOT A LIFE UNFORTUNATELY WITH SOME SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTAL -- ILLNESSES THAT THEY HAVE TWO INDOOR THEIR FAMILIES HAVE TO WONDER IT AFFECTS OUR AYE HSS -- IT'S TIME FOR US. TO PUT THE RHETORIC ASIDE. IT'S TIME FOR US. TO TO DO ACTION. AND THE WAY WE DO ACTION AS WE START RESTORING THESE RATES WE SHOULD HAVE A THREE YEAR PHASE IN WHERE WE GET TO THAT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN THE GENERAL FUND -- AND WE NEED TO START THIS YEAR. AND SO -- I HOPE THE CHOKE. MY MESSAGE TO THE GOVERNOR THAT -- THIS IS NOT ENOUGH AND WE NEED TO DO MORE. RIGHT THAT AGAIN YEAH THANK YOU. SORRY. ALL RIGHT SIR TARA. WELL I WANT TO THANK SENATOR STONE OR HIS COMMENTS TODAY AND I AGREE WITH HIM A HUNDRED AND THING THAT I WANT YOU ALL TO KIND OF TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IS THAT. THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS KIND OF SCENE THIS IS WHERE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- IT'S SEEN AS A AS A LOCATION AS A PLACE THAT -- IS A LOW COST PLACE TO LIVE AND THE REALITY IS IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT THE AVERAGE INCOME YOU LOOK AT THE COST OF RENT TO LOOK AT THE COST OF HOMES. IT'S NOT A FOR BOTTLE AFFORDABLE AT ALL -- IT'S MAYBE NOT IF YOU KNOW THE SAME SALARY OR AS AS AS YOU KNOW. THE PEOPLE -- IN FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE BUT THAT THERE'S JUSTIN AT INCOME INEQUALITY THERE THAT THAT WE REALLY NEED. TO THINK ABOUT AND RECONSIDER WILMER LOOKING AT AT AT ALL OF IT SO JUST WANT YOU TO KIND OF KEEP THAT IN MIND AND OF COURSE -- MORE SUPPORT IS ALWAYS GREAT. THANK YOU. SO. BEGIN APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION ALSO WANT THANK THE PANELISTS IDEA OF SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SO FIRST OF ALL. AND DIED SO I'M SURE I GOT THIS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I THINK -- YOU -- DOES THAT TO IT IS SO IN TERMS OF THE WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S FOR POSING FOR THIS COMING YEAR SO WE HAD SO WILL BASICALLY HAVE THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHICH WAS Z. PRESENTED THERE'S A LOT OF VARIATION THERE'S A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND CLARITY AND AND NOW WE HAVE THIS. RATE STUDY WHICH YOU KNOW IT. I THINK YOU'RE GETTING SOME FEEDBACK IT'S LIKE ANYTHING THIS LARGE ISN'T PERFECT AND SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE WORKED OUT. ARE WE LOOKING AT BUILD SO. ARE WE E. IF WE THE THE RESOURCES THAT WE PUT THEM ON TOP OF THE OLD SYSTEM AND SAY WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THE RATE STUDY OR RESTORING THE USE TE THIS. THIS IS THE BASIS OF FUTURE -- OR OF STARTING THIS YEAR'S SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT LIKE HOW. THE RESOURCES WE ARE DEDICATING OF WE DO ADD MORE RESOURCES TO THE BILL THAT ON THIS RATE STUDY IS THE SORT OF THE FACE FOUNDATION FOR THAT -- BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM THE LA -- FOR EXAMPLE WELL WE BUILD ON THE OLD% ONE AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT I'VE HEARD LOTS OF HOLD HARMLESS BUT NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IS. THOSE WERE DURING THE TRANSITION -- WHAT SHOULD BE THE THIRTY UNDERLYING? IT'LL STRUCTURAL BASE OF OF OF% OF OF ANY SORT OF FAT FUNDING WHICH WE CLEARLY -- I THINK PEOPLE EXPRESS WE NEEDED SO. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN ON LOOKING AT THE ASSUMPTIONS WHEN AND THAT PROJECTION WITH THE WITHIN THE SERVICES THAT I HAD OUTLINED -- THE WILD AND THE RATE MODELS OF IMPLEMENTATION AS LA -- HAD PRESENTED IS IS CERTAIN OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WAS NOT PART OF THE ASSUMPTIONS IN LOOKING AT THE FISCAL PROJECTIONS. OF THE KIND OF METHODOLOGY AN ALLOCATION HOWEVER LOOKING AT INFORMATION FROM THE RATE STUDY YOU KNOW THAT INFORMED KIND OF THE ELEMENTS OF IT -- WAS PARTISAN THE ASSUMPTIONS IN AND TAKING A LOOK AT HOW TO DO SOME -- PROJECTED ALLOCATION SO THE I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THEY SUPPORTED LIVING SERVICES AND KNOWINGTHAT THERE'S WITHIN THE RATE STUDY THAT IF. OF PARTICULARS REGIONAL CENTER -- WOULD HAVE BEEN PROJECTED AT A CERTAIN RATE -- ADJUSTMENT AS COMPARED TO ANOTHER ONE KIND OF FACTORY AND FACTORING IN THOSE DIFFERENCES -- IF YOU WELL KINDA WAITING IT -- WOULD KINDA HELP MOVE THE NEEDLE TOWARDS ADDRESSING SOME OF THE IN EQUITIES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS. AS A THAT ASSUMPTION WAS BUILT IN INTO TRAIN TO TAKE A LOOK AT ON AN AVERAGE --THE FISCAL PROJECTION WOULD BE AT ABOUT 18% -- ADJUSTMENT OVER EXISTING RATES THAT SAID THAT WOULD BE VARIABLE BASED ON THE DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS DIFFERENT PROVIDERS -- CONSIDERING SOME OF THOSE -- ELEMENTS THAT DO YOU. IMPACT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN. PROVIDER RATE I'M SORRY FOR IT IT'S SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED BUT IT IS IT'S TAKING ELEMENTS THAT INFORMED US TO BE ABLE TO APPLY SO IT WOULDN'T JUST BE PERPETUATING. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE DON'T WANT TO PERPETUATE BUT NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTING A MODEL. OKAY SO SERVE SOMETHING IN BETWEEN. THE HYBRID HYBRID IT'S IT'S IT'S TAKING ELEMENTS THAT'S INFORMATIVE TO US -- BUT NOT IMPLEMENTING THE MODEL THAT WE WE WANT TO USE THE INFORMATION -- TO CONSIDERATE AT ADDRESSING -- PRIORITIES OKAY SO BECAUSE I THINK IT ALSO IN TERMS OF SENDING. I GUESS I'LL CALL SIGNAL OR SITTING WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE. AT WHAT POINT AGAIN RECOGNIZING THEIR STILL NEEDS TO BE A LOT MORE STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND THERE'S SOME ADJUSTMENTS AND AND I HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS AND SO FORTH THE AT WHAT POINT. DO YOU ANTICIPATE SWITCHING OVER TO SAYING THAT AND AGAIN I REALIZE YOU MAY YOU KNOW YOU MAY TWO THINGS IT'S AT RIGHT NOT ONLY WITH THE RATES A SELF BUT WITH EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO BUT WHEN YOU SAY THIS IS IN THE MIDDLE. AT SOME POINT DO YOU TELL PEOPLE LIKE ACTUALLY THE BASE ASSUMPTIONS ARE THE BASIS IS GOING TO BE. RELATED TO THE METHODOLOGY DEVELOPED FOR I DON'T TOLERATE STUDY ANYMORE AT ALL THIS BECAUSE IT WOULD PASS THE STUDY PHASE RIGHT WE ACTUALLY THIS IS NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WAR WE CAN IMPLEMENT IT OR NOT -- SO THE RATE PROPOSAL ORDER RATE STRUCTURE -- BECAUSE NO LONGER JUST THE STUDY SO WHAT POINT DO WE SAY IS INTENTION TO SAY WELL OKAY FOR NOW THIS IS THE FOUNDATION ON WHICH WE BUILD. WHETHER IT'S INCREASES ARE AT CENTER -- AND DISS THE METHODOLOGY WHICH WE'RE NOW BRACING IS BEING THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO HANDLE PAYMENTS GOING FORWARD. SO AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER THAT -- AN IMPORTANT PART OF LOOKING AT THIS NEXT STEP IS THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS SUMMER. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING BROAD AS FAR AS THE NOT ONLY THE RATE STUDY BUT THE SYSTEM AND EVERY KIND OF EVERY ELEMENT INTO IT. SO SO AS FAR AS THOSE NEXT STEPS THE IMPORTANT PART OF THAT IS DEFINITELY HAVING THAT VERY TARGETED DISCUSSION OVER THE SUMMER ON THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY INFLUENCING THIS AND AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU HEARD TODAY. NO NO IT HAS TO BE PART OF IT YOU DID I HEAR DISCUSSION OBVIOUSLY DISCUSSIONS VERY IMPORTANT AND THEN CHANGES WILL BE MADE BASED ON THE DISCUSSIONS BUT AS THE GOAL LIKE BY NEXT YEAR FOR PHILLY OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GONNA BE ADJUSTMENTS OR CHANGES MADE BASED ON THE FEEDBACK. TO TRY TO MOVE TOWARD A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE SAYING THAT THIS IS GONNA NOW BECAUSE THE BASE AND I REALIZE THERE MIGHT BE THINGS YOU DO CUTS CLEANERS AND SO FORTH AS YOUR TRAIN TRANSITION OVER BUT THAT FUNDAMENTALLY WE MADE THE DECISION THIS IS THE NEW MODEL. SO TO DISCUSSIONS YOU KNOW WE WE APPRECIATE THAT THAT THAT WE'RE NOT WANTING TO HAVE A DISCUSSION FOR THE PURPOSE OF HAVING ANOTHER DISCUSSION RIGHT YOU KNOW BUT WHAT IS THE PATH WHAT IS THAT PATH FORWARD. YOU KNOW AND AND AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE -- TO OBTAIN CLARITY YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO GOAL BY NEXT YEAR TO SERVE AT LEAST I MEAN YOU HAVE A STUDY RIGHT YEAH I CONSULT NEED TO STUDY YOU'RE GETTING YOUR CALL BACK FROM PEOPLE. CORRECT THE GOAL WOULD DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO HAVE A CLEAR PATH AS TO WHAT THOSE NEXT STEPS ARE TO WHAT THOSE. THOSE ARE. WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION OKAY WELL I I GUESS IS THERE GOING TO BE AND YOU PAYMENT METHODOLOGY ESSENTIALLY. BASED ON THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAVE WE WILL HAVE AN WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE CLARITY AS TO WHAT. APPROACH OR METHODOLOGIES WILL BE DOING THAT TODAY WE DON'T HAVE THAT ANSWER BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO HAVE THAT BROADER DISCUSSION -- AND WE'RE PREPARED TO DO THAT OVER THE SUMMER APPRECIATE. KEEPING A SURPRISE TO THE A THE I I THINK. BY THE AT SOME POINT -- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO THE EIGHTH AT SOME POINT. WE'RE GONNA TO MAKE A DECISION ARE YOU GONNA STICK TO THE OLD WAY ARE WE MOVING TO THIS NEW WAY RIGHT I WAS WE MADE THIS INVESTMENT THE LEGISLATURE SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE MADE DALY THAT. YOU DID THE STUDY ETCETERA AND EVERYONE'S GONNA GIVE THEIR FEEDBACK AND QUESTIONS YOU SAY WELL ACTUALLY. THIS IS THE WAY WE'RE PLAYING TO DO THINGS WE MAY HAVE TO MAKE SOME CORRECTIONS RIGHT SOME ASSUMPTIONS ARE RIGHT WE'RE GONNA KILL MAYBE NOT LIBERTIES MANY TOES AT YOU BECAUSE WHATEVER ELSE THOSE ARE KIND OF LIKE THE FAINT BUT BUT FUNDAMENTALLY WE GOING THIS DIRECTION OR WE LIKE. WELL. WE PULLED EXCEL SOME POINT WE GOT TO HAVE SOME CLARITY ANYTHING PEOPLE NEED SOME CLARITY WHETHER YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT WE SHOULD DO BUT SOMEBODY AT THE SAVE WELL WE'RE GONNA MAKE A DECISION WHICH WAY WE'RE GOING TO SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO PLAN MOVING FORWARD. AND ALSO SAME HERE TO IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO. OUR OUR PAYMENTS I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING FROM LA AS WELL. YES AND I I WOULD JUST ADD ON TO THAT POINT THAT I THINK IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE CHALLENGING I MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO BE GROWING PAINS ASSOCIATED WITH MOVING TO A NEW RATE SETTING METHODOLOGY AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE. EVERY SINGLE POLICY REGULATORY GUIDANCE LIKE EVERY CHANGE THAT MIGHT NEED TO BE MADE AHEAD OF TIME AND AT SOME POINT. YOU HAVE TO JUMP IN AND SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT AND MAYBE MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS ALONG THE WAY I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT TO PUT ANYONE AT RISK. GOING TO GET INTO LEGAL CHALLENGES OR OR THAT SORT OF THING BUT YOU COULD CONTINUE TO STUDY THIS PROBABLY INSTEAD NEVER. REACH THE PERFECT SOLUTION SO -- WELL I MEAN I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND ANY IS IS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS WILL BE STILL INVOLVING IT'S OUR AND ADJUSTMENTS AND THINGS WILL CHANGE IN ENVIRONMENT TO SELL. BUT SORT OF I THINK THIS SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU FROM YOUR PRESENTATION FROM READING THINGS THAT. THERE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING THINGS THE WAY WE'RE DOING NOW WHICH THERE'S NOT A LOT TRANSPARENCY AND THERE'S A LOT OF VARIABILITY AND NOT ALL OF ITS HISTORY JUSTIFIED. AND THEN WE'RE TRYING TO COME WITH A MORE SYSTEMATIC WAY OF DOING THINGS. THERE ARE SOME WINNERS AND LOSERS THERE SO PEOPLE MAY NOT BE SO HAPPY WITH THAT EITHER BUT JUST. TELL AND AND NOT SAYING THAT. WE HAVE A PERFECT SYSTEM EITHER THE EACH ONE COULD OF ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO SELL ITEMS THAT I HOPE THAT -- THERE THAT WE CAN MAKE SOME PROGRESS IN FIGURING THAT OUT THOUGH. TELL OKAY -- AND THEN I CAN DO SO SOME OF THE MORE SPECIFIC. QUESTIONS ABOUT SO WE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE PRESENTERS FOR EXAMPLE -- LIKE ON THE LABOR SIDE RATE WE HAVE. CERTAIN LABOR RULES IN PLACE -- THERE TO PROTECT WORKERS AND SO FORTH -- SO CLEARLY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE BUT THINGS LIKE BREAKS AND SO FORTH THAT AND THE LEASE IT WAS REPORTED THAT THEY FELT LIKE THAT THAT WASN'T REALLY INCORPORATED INTO THE METHODOLOGY IS. LIKE MAYBE CAN PERHAPS THAT YOUR TECHNICAL EXPERT CAN SPEAK -- TO TO TO TO THAT ISSUE -- THAT WAS REYES SO IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW USING THE BLS VERSES O OTHER TYPES OF WAYS OF LOOKING AT THINGS OF YOU. OF OF COURSE SENATOR PAN AND AND ALL HAVE -- OUR CONSULTING GO AHEAD AND AND RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION REGARDING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE INCLUDED THE KIND OF TECHNICAL PIECES OF IT -- BUT I DO WANT TO ALSO JUST -- SHARE WHICH I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING BUT I DO WANT TO ALSO GIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF KIND OF THAT INPUT. YOU KNOW HAVING THE INPUT -- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE SOME OF THOSE COMMENTS. TODAY YOU KNOW THIS IS PRETTY CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT -- THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS SHARED ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK HAS BEEN A VALUE IN LOOKING AT KINDA ELEMENTS OF KIND OF THE OF TOTAL. KIND OF PICTURE OF THE THE RATE MODELS IS THAT THERE IS. ELEMENTS OF IT THAT TALKS TO A COMPENSATION PACKAGE -- AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- WAS IMPORTANT IN SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE ALSO RECEIVE SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT ISN'T AS SO JUST POINT OUT YOUR ANSWERS COOLEY WE'RE NOT WE DON'T EITHER HAVE THE TIME AND I HAVEN'T HAD DEAL TO GO THROUGH WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GO THROUGH EACH LITTLE. DETAIL THE SERVER ON A HIGHER LEVEL. LIKE HOW -- HOW DID YOU APPROACH AND GET INFORMATION ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE BE SURELY MORE ACT ACTUALLY REFLECT THE LABOR COSTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA GIVE? OUR YOU KNOW OUR LAWS AND RULES ABOUT THAT HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF I'LL TRY TO BE. BRIEF MY ANSWER FOR WHAT WAS A RELATIVELY COMPLICATED PORTION OF THE ANALYSIS. SO AS SOME OF THE PANELISTS ALLUDED TO WE RELYON FIRST AND FOREMOST ON DATA FROM INDEPENDENT DATA SOURCES FOR OUR WAGES OPTION SO PEOPLE MADE REFERENCE TO THE BLS FOR THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. WHICH IS AN OFFICE WITHIN THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF LABOR THEY DO A EMPLOYER SURVEY. TO GATHER INFORMATION ON CURRENT WAGE LEVELS. AS FOLKS INDICATED WE USED A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OCCUPATIONS TO SET THE WAITRESS OPTIONS FOR MOST THOUGH NOT ALL THE RATE MODELS. AND WE'RE TALKING -- DSPS WHICH ARE REALLY THE BALK OF THE WORK FORCE THE ID SYSTEM WE STARTED WITH THE PERSONAL CARE IN WHICH FOLKS OF MANSION AND AND SOME FOLKS HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE USE THAT PARTICULAR CLASSIFICATION. THE REASON WE START WITH THAT THOUGH IS THAT IS WHERE BEYONCE CURRENTLY ASSIGNS DIAZ PIECE OF FOLKS MAY FEEL THE DESCRIPTION DOES NOT DO JUSTICE TO WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING AND I WOULD NOT DISAGREE WITH THAT POSITION. BUT THAT IS WHAT -- FROM THE ALSO PERSPECTIVE WEATHER CLASSIFIEDS THAT WAGE REPRESENTS WHAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY EARNING TODAY WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ORGANIZATION MY PURPOSE LONG FELT UNCOMFORTABLE RELYING ONLY ON THAT CLASSIFICATION BECAUSE WE DO THINK IT UNDERVALUES -- OCCUPATIONS. TO EFFECTIVELY COME UP A WEIGHTED AVERAGE RECOGNIZE THE OTHER WORK ABOVE AND BEYOND SOME OF THE CUSTODIAL CARE THAT FOLKS ALLUDED TO EARLIER SO THE OTHER OCCUPATIONS WE USED WERE. THE PSYCHIATRIC A TO ROCK TO ACKNOWLEDGE OF FOLKS OFTENTIMES OUR BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES AND HE'D BE MANAGED AS WELL. THE HOME HEALTH AIDE AGAIN TO HELP PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL NEEDS ANOTHER RICK RICK RECREATIONAL WORKER WHICH REALLY SPEAKS TO HELPING PEOPLE ACCESS THE COMMUNITY. SO THAT REALLY IS OUR INTENT TO MAKE THAT WERE REFLECTING THE BROAD SORTS RESPONSIBILITIES THAT DIAZ PEACE HAVE. AFTER WE MADE OUR ASSUMPTIONS IN TERMS WHAT THAT JOB MAKES IS WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ON HOW TO ADJUST THE WAGES FROM THE BLS BECAUSE THAT WAS PUBLISHED THE DATA WAS AVAILABLE TO US -- WHAT REFLECTED WAGES MAY? TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BY NINE YEARS CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC INFORMATION FROM THAT YOU DIDN'T TAKE NATIONAL RATE CAPS IS A NATIONAL SURVEY BUT MISTER CHAIRMAN ABSOLUTELY WE USE STATE SPECIFIC DATA AND THAT IN FACT. TO COME UP WITH SOME OF THE VARIATIONS ONE RESULTS IN THE NEXT WE USE LOCAL AREA OF INFORMATION IT'S ALSO BE ABLE TO THE BLS AT ALL CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC WORK COUNTY SPECIFIC WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- BUT THEN WE ALSO HAD TO FURTHER INFLATE THE WAGES TO REFLECT CHANGES THAT OCCURRED SINCE MAY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN MOST NOTABLY THE RAISING THE RISING I SHOULD SAY MINIMUM WAGE WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO IT'S ALWAYS IMPORT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT OUR RATES REFLECT A POINT IN TIME THE POINT IN TIME THAT WE WERE TRYING TO REFLECT IS THE COMING FISCAL YEAR ALTHOUGH AS BOTH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE AS WELL AS A LOOKED AT LA OLD INDICATED IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME. TO IMPLEMENT THESE RATES BUT WE HAD TO START WITH WHEN IMPLEMENTATION COULD CONCEIVABLY BEGAN WHICH WAS COMING THE COMING FISCAL YEAR. SO WE ADJUST THE RATE MODELS REFLECTED INCREASE TO THIRTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR MINIMUM WAGE. BUT WE ALSO ACCOUNTED FOR GENERALIZED WAGE GROWTH WHICH THE UREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS ANOTHER FEDERAL OFFICE WITHIN THE PUBLIC COMMERCE. REPORTED BE THREE POINT 6% ON AN ANNUAL BASIS HERE WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE MADE THAT THOSE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BLS DATA TO KIND OF BRING THEM CURRENTS AND THE REASON I TALK ABOUT THIS BEING A POINT IN TIME IS THIS IS FOR THE COMING FISCAL YEAR. BUT AS THE LA ALWAYS INDICATED THE RATE MODELS KIND OF AN THEMSELVES BEING UPDATED CAM THAT'S A POLICY DECISION AFTER REPORTS MAY BE MADE. BUT IN A WAY TOOLS INCREASE TO FOURTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND FIFTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT THE REBELS COULD THE FURTHER UPDATED TO REFLECT THE ON GOING INCREASES THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. THE REBELS AS EXISTE REFLECT THIRTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR NOT FIFTY DOLLARS NOW BECAUSE THAT'S A COUPLE YEARS HENCE. AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE WELL SOMEONE SAID YOU DIDN'T CORPORATION. REST BREAKS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS WE REQUIRES WELL IS THAT BECAUSE DO YOU THINK THAT'S IS INCORPORATED INTO THAT BLS DATA OR AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DIDN'T OR DID YOU IT'S SO I DID LIKE THAT MAYBE A LITTLE INTO THE WEEDS BUT MR JOURNAL I I WOULD NOT. ARGUE THAT IT'S PART OF THE THE BUT I'M ALSO NOT A A LABOR ATTORNEY SO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IS WE CERTAINLY RECEIVE THAT KIND OF BOTH IN WRITING HERE. TODAY AND WILL HAVE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHETHER AND HOW THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO CORPORATE ON THE RIGHT MODELS AFTER CONSULTING WITH. WITH MORE LEARNING LEGAL MINDS AND FIND SO THIS IS A FREE OF ANOTHER. I UNDERSTAND FROM JUST READ THE DESCRIPTION IN THERE THAT TIME TO DIG THROUGH THE WHOLE REPORT BUT FOR EXAMPLE USE MEDI CAL RATES FOR SOME OF THE PROVIDERS -- SOME OFFICIALS TO PROVIDE SERVICES IT WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA'S ALMOST AT THE BOTTOM. OF THE COUNTRY -- MANY OF THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES DO SO IN THE CONTEXT OF THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY. HEALTH CENTERS WHERE TO ACTUALLY GET A BILL ADDITIONAL GRANTS TO MAKE UP FOR THE COSTS SO IT MAY NOT NESTLE ACTUALLY REFLECT WHAT THE ACTUAL COST OF SERVICE BECAUSE SINCE THOSE PROVIDER ACTUALLY. GET A DIGITAL FEDERAL FUNDS BEYOND THAT MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT RATE. SO I WONDERED IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN TO ME WHY MEDI CAL RATE WAS THE MOST APPROPRIATE VERSES A MORE -- RATE LIKE MEDICARE ACTUALLY SOME OF OUR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO USE MEDICARE RATES THEY FOUND OUT THAT THAT IS THE ACTUAL TRULY MORE COMPETITIVE RATE. OR COMMERCIAL RATES WHICH ARE EVEN HIGHER TO MEDICARE RATES AWAY MEDI CAL RATES WHICH CLEARLY THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO SHOW LESS YOU HAVE THAT. YOU KNOW ADJUSTMENT THE PBS ADJUSTMENTS -- USUALLY DOESN'T ENOUGH TO COVER THE COSTS. MISTER CHAIRMAN SO AS A KIND OPENING REVIEW OF THE SERVICE SYSTEM -- AS A GENERAL RULE DDS. IS THERE RATES FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. TO THE MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULE WHAT THEY REFER TO THE SCUTTLED MAXIMUM ALLOWANCES SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS IN EXISTENCE PRIOR TO THE RACE STUDY -- BEGINNING ONE WE TALKED ABOUT HOW. SOME OF THE MISCELLANEOUS SERVICE BECAUSE OF A USED -- OUTSIDE THAT FEW SKETCH WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO WRAP IT BACK INTO THAT GENERALIZE CONCEPT OF IF IT'S A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL LIKE A THERAPIST IT OUGHT TO BE TIED BACK TO THE MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULE. SO THAT WAS THE THOUGHT PROCESS IS THAT WAS THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK THAT EXISTS TODAY. AS I THINK YOU MENTIONED WE DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ABOUT BEYOND THE MEDI CAL FEES GO TO BE APPROPRIATE SO WE PUT THE POTENTIAL FOR THAT AUGMENTATION OF OF 40%. WHICH IS BORROWING FROM POLICIES AVAILABLE IN THE CHECK CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN POSITIONS SERVICES. TOLD ME THAT WHEN YOU'RE SPECIFICALLY ASKED ME HOW WE ARRIVED THERE THAT'S HOW WE ARRIVED THERE AGAIN CERTAINLY WE'VE HEARD FEEDBACK FROM THERAPEUTIC OF SERVICE PROVIDERS AS WELL AS AN INFANT EARLY TO BED EARLY INFANT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AS WELL. AND THAT'S PART OF THE CONSIDERATION PROCESS WERE WERE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKE. TAKINGS PARTIES PUBLIC CONCERTS SO USUALLY EM MEDIC TELLS NOT THE SORT OF THE BEST BENCHMARK -- SO I THINK HOPEFULLY -- WE CAN LOOK AT DEL BUT IT'S SO HOPEFULLY THAT CAN BE VISITED I'M SURE YOU'LL GET SOME FEEDBACK ON THAT BUT CERTAINLY IS THIS COMMITTEE WE ALSO OVERSEE DTS AND MEDI CAL. AND A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MEDI CAL RATES AND THE ALL THE DIFFERENT. BOB DOLE SOURCES OF FUNDS THAT FLOW INTO -- AND AND AND TO WHAT WHAT FRAZIER WHAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET YOU ARE TAKING CARE MEDI CAL PATIENTS CELL. AND OFTEN THEIR CROSS SUBSIDIZED SO THE MOST YOU ALSO INCLUDE THE VALUE OF THE ABOUT ACROSS SUBSIDIES OR OTHER SOURCES YOU'RE NOT REALLY YOU KNOW CAPTURING WHAT. IS NEEDED CELL. AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER -- IT WAS BROUGHT UP TO I MEAN I'M A GET A MENTION OF TEACHER XIN EARLY INTERVENTION AND NOT FRAGMENTING AND SO. WHEN WE SAW IN TERMS OF -- AND COMING UP WITH THE METHODOLOGY HOW TO TAKE CARE OF WE WANT TO DO TEAM BASED CARE TEAM BASED EVALUATION AND SO IS IS THAT. IS THAT THE TERMS OF I'M SURE THAT'S NOT THE ONLY PLACE BUT OF THE IT'S A BIG PLACE EARLY INTERVENTION NINE THAT FAMILIAR WITH THE WE DO TEAM BASED EVALUATIONS SO WE DON'T WANT. TO BREAK THAT ALL DOLLED INDIVIDUAL PIECES SO THAT SOMETHING -- YOU'RE LOOKING TO CORRECT OR ADDRESS. THANK YOU MISTER TERRY. SIMILAR TO A LOT OF THE CONVERSATIONS AND COMMENTS -- VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AND TAKING A LOOK AND WERE REVIEWING ALL OF THE COMMENTS ON WILL BE RESPONDING TO THOSE -- WE DID HERE WHEN WE WERE PRESENTING TO WHEN WE'RE ROLLING OUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE MODELS. THAT SOME OF THE EARLY INTERVENTION PROVIDERS HAD SHARED THOSE CONCERNS EVEN AT THAT POINT AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO HEAR SOME SOME FEEDBACK ON THAT AND SO. AGAIN WITH EVERYTHING ELSE -- WORK WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT ALL THE THE DIFFERENT PIECES THAT ARE ARE COMING BACK TO US AS FAR AS RESPONSES TO THE MODELS. I GUESS IS IS GO BACK THAT SORT OF BACK. AROUND TOO I REGIONAL QUESTION IS IS THAT YOUR YOUR RIGHT YOU'VE MADE A GOOD EFFORT RIGHT WE THAT WE HEARD A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS MODEL YEAR SOME THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ADJUSTED. DO YOU ANTICIPATE. THIS MORE FOR THE PART AND OUT OF THE CONSOLE STOVALL THEY'RE NOT -- AT SOME POINT COMING BACK AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM PEOPLE OVER THE SUMMER -- BUT I ALSO THINK MY OVERSIGHT FUNCTION WHAT POINT DO WE COME BACK AND SAY OKAY SO. WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE SMILE AND THEY'LL MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS AND SO FORTH AND GO FORTH WITH THAT -- ONE AND WE CAN DO THAT OR SO AND SO I THAT I KNOW OF THE I KEEP HEARING A LOT OF DISCUSSION I ONE AT A TIME A LITTLE BIT OF TIME LINE THAT'S LIKE WHEN SHOULD WE COME BACK AND HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THOSE APARTMENT PLAN TO DO. IN TERMS OF PAYMENTS WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T PAY ENOUGH. BUT BEYOND THAT NOT PAYING ENOUGH HOW WE'RE GOING TO PAY PEOPLE AND THEIR EXPECTATIONS ARE GONNA BE IMPORTANT TO SELL ARE WE GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS IS THIS PATH. THE PATH WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH. TO ADJUSTMENTS OR ARE THERE SOME OTHER PATH RINGO AT SOME POINT WE SEE AFTER YOU GET THE FEEDBACK. WE NEED TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION SO. BUT I MEAN WE WILL OBVIOUSLY BE BACK HERE YOU KNOW A YEAR FROM NOW HAVING. THIS CONVERSATION I DON'T KNOWS IT'S BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN FIGURE IT HERE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS -- LOW EARLIER ABOUT BY QUARTERS THE THINKING OF THE DEPARTMENT NOW I WE'VE SPENT ALL THIS WE SPENT THREE YEARS ON THE CITY. A A WE'VE BEEN WORKING A COUPLE YEARS ON THIS RIGHT OKAY YEAH SO IF OF FOR A LOT OF INVESTMENT IN THIS SO. YEAH. SO. YOU DON'T SIMILAR -- TO CAN I GET I I DON'T WANT TO I'M NOT DISMISSING -- THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE EARLY START AND TAKING A LOOK AT KIND OF THE THE KIND OF THE GROUP AND AND THE COMMENTS THAT HE CAME BACK -- BUT I I'M GOING TO KIND OF COMPARE IT TO WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE RATE MODELS WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE IN THE RIGHT MODELS INFORMING US. SO WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT PIECES. YOU KNOW IT'S SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WERE RECEIVING RIGHT NOW SO. WE'RE WE'RE RECEIVING FEEDBACK ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT -- ELEMENTS WITHIN THE RATE STUDY AND SO I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONVERSATION THIS BROADER CONVERSATION. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE YOU KNOW OVER THE YEAH I SAY OVER THE SUMMER JUST BECAUSE THAT THE TIMING WORK PRETTY MUCH AT SUMMER RIGHT. SO HERE WE HAVE THIS VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION ABOUT. KIND OF OURS ARE OUR SYSTEM IN LOOKING AT THE RATE STUDY IN LOOKING AT THOSE ELEMENTS AND THEN LOOKING AT THE REGIONAL CENTEROVERSIGHT AND LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE BROADER PIECES. SO TO TO SAY THAT I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE ON EARLY START ON THIS PARTICULAR COMMENT YOU KNOW AGAIN I'M NOT MINIMIZING KIND OF THOSE IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS. BUT IT HAS TO BE IN THIS BROADER CONTEXT. SO AND ENDS THAT IS REALLY WHERE THOSE NEXT STEPS ARE AS IN THIS BROADER CONTEXT. WE ARE REVIEWING ALL THOSE COMMENTS AND THAT IS OUR PRIORITY IN THE PRIORITY OF OUR CONSULTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET THROUGH THAT SO WE CAN. PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO AS PART OF OUR TRANSPARENCY PIECE OF OUR RATES STUDY IS TO SAY HERE'S THE COMMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY CAN SEE THOSE. OKAY WELL ACTUALLY WHEN I SAID TERMS OF FALL OFF IT IS ABOUT THE BROADER CONTEXT RATE I MEAN MY SERVE ASKING ABOUT SOME. SPECIFICS THAT CAME UP IN THE THE AND THE PRESENTATIONS BUT REALLY IT IS ABOUT THAT'S RIGHT THE BIGGER QUESTION IS IS THAT ARE WE RESTRUCTURING THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO THE PAYMENTS I MEAN THAT'S BASICALLY. RIGHT AND THAT'S DEL AND OBVIOUSLY WE SPENT THIS TIME AND EFFORT DOING GREAT STUDY -- WE HEARD FROM LA -- SAYING THAT TOO EASY ON TO PHASE I WHAT SOME PILOTS AND SEE HOW THEY WERE WORKING AT CETERA SO. BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT THERE'S A YOU KNOW AND AND ME AND AGAIN I UNDERSTAND MAYBE JUST THIS IS NOT THE TIME YET TO MAKE THE COMMITMENT. AND WHETHER YOU FEEL THAT IT SHOULD MAKE THE COMMITMENT TOWARDS -- YOU KNOW YOU'D BE GETTING FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE IN THERE ARE ADJUSTMENTS ARE GONNA BE MADE RIGHT SO -- BUT THEY SAID YOU KNOW IT I THINK THAT -- IT BE GOOD TO HAVE A BETTER IDEA IS TO UNDERSTAND. ONCE YOU HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS NOT TO LEAVE IT OPEN FOR OVER A LOT YOU KNOW FOR FOR YEARS AND YEARS BUT MAYBE WITHIN A YEAR HAVE AN IDEA LIKE WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT THINKING ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO AND BECAUSE THE ANY IMPLEMENTATION OBVIOUSLY IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. IMMEDIATELY IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME TO DO THE TRANSITION IT'S ADDRESS. IF IF THAT'S THE DECISION RIGHT IT COULD BE THAT OF WHAT WOULD TO STICK TO THE OLD WAY IN. OKAY YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD NO NO WHAT I WHAT I I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH WHAT'S PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISED IS. ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THINGS THAT [inaudible] TALK ABOUT. THE STABILIZATION OF SOME KIND A KEY AND TARGETED AREAS NO WHILE. YOU KNOW THE AREAS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AREAS THAT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FOCUS ON SOME STABILIZATION AND TAKING A LOOK AT BEING ABLE. TO YOU KNOW FOCUS ALSO ON THE H. CBS YOU KNOW OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMPLIANCE AND BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HAVE. SOME ADDRESSING KIND OF SOME STATE STATE WIDE AREAS SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT AND THAT ALL IS ABOUT. KIND OF ENHANCING SOME CONSUMER. EXPERIENCES YOU KNOW AND WHILE IT MAY NOT BE EMPLOYMENT TEEN KIND OF THIS BROADER PIECE OF IT. IT'S IT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF OF FRAME IN OUR CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE HAVING THIS SUMMER IS TO SAY WHAT ARE THOSE. WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS ON BUT NOT TO MINIMIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF? KIND OF THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE PUT FORWARD RIGHT NOW. TWO TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN HAVE KIND OF THIS. THIS PIECE OF IT THAT WE CAN -- MOVE FORWARD RIGHT NOW -- SO I I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE USE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN KIND OF THE THE FOCUSED IN TARGETED AREAS AND AND USING KIND OF THE PIECES ALSO ON THE SIDE OF THE OVERSIGHT AND AND AND BRINGING IT. TO KIND OF THE GROUP THAT WE'VE HAD THE CONVERSATIONS WITH AND AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TEARS YOUR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS AND SAYING OKAY WELL WHAT WHAT ARE THOSE. WHERE WHERE DO WE GO WITH THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND AND -- WELL I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC DATE RIGHT NOW -- I HEAR YOUR QUESTION. OKAY WELL WHY THE US SO -- I'D -- LOOKING FORWARD TO THE ONGOING CONVERSATION I KNOW THAT FIRST OF ALL YOUR DEPARTMENT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE'VE. CLOSING DOWN DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WE'RE DOING A CBS WHICH WE HEARD PREVIOUSLY WE NOW THIS RATE STUDY DOES A LOT OF BIG MOVING PARTS THAT'S GOING ON THE SAME TIME WE ALSO KNOW THAT -- WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH -- PROVIDING DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES BECAUSE LOW PAYMENTS -- THE ABILITY TO RECRUIT PEOPLE WITH -- YOU KNOW THE THE THE GROWING POPULATION YOU SAID YOUR CASELOAD IS INCREASING AS WELL -- AND THE SO THE AND DOES SO YES AND SO I WENT IS FIGURE OUT LIKE WHAT HOW HOW DO WE PAUL THESE. THREADS TOGETHER AND ALSO. YOU KNOW IT IN MANY WAYS -- IS WE'RE TRYING TO GET MORE RESOURCES. IT'S IT WILL BE A NEW BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC NOT JUST THAT -- WELL WITH LIVING SERVICES BUT ALSO IS THAT WE THE ROOTS BEING DONE IN A YOU KNOW AN ORGANIZED TRANSPARENT WAY THAT MAKES SENSE TO PEOPLE SO THAT -- SO AGAIN IT'S THERE'S EXPECTATIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY ABOUT WHAT THERE'S GONNA BE A IN THERE'S A AND ALSO TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC THAT THEIR DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT WISELY. AND THAT DID AND SO I THINK PEOPLE IN GENERAL WANT TO HELP OUT MORE. NO LIFE A FRIEND THAT I COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WANTING TO DO MORE. AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE GOING TO ROUTE SAID OKAY NOW THAT WE PUT. MONEY THERE WE PUT YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY LARGER AMOUNTS OF MONEY IN FEAR AS A WELL WHAT WE GET OUT YEAH WHAT HAPPENED THE RETURN I HAVE WE CHANGED MOVE THE NEEDLE HAD FIELD ARE MORE PEOPLE GETTING CARE AND SO FORTH AND WE CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION. IT'S HARDER TO GET MORE RESOURCES SO -- SO ANYWAY OKAY. ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS ALL RIGHT OKAY SO -- WE'RE GONNA TAKE THEN HERE ARE THERE'S A PROPOSAL FOR INVESTMENT HAS TO DO WITH THE RATES AND THEN AFTER THAT WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THOSE TWO ITEMS TOGETHER SO -- WILL MOVE ON SAYS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM OKAY SO ABOUT THE ISSUED AND HAS A WE HAVE A INVESTMENT PROPOSAL. YEAH SO THAT'S ISSUE -- TO THAT'S AND THAT'S HIS PRESENTING. AND THAT SIDE TOWARD LINDSEY SECOND RECTOR OF THE ARK OF CALIFORNIA. THIS. OKAY IS MISTER LINDSEY HERE ARE. THINGS MISTER LINDSEY. FROM THE ARC [inaudible] NOW [inaudible] THERE. O.. OKAY IS ON HIS WAY DOWN ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. HEY. ALL RIGHT SO -- CAST YOU TO KEEP YOUR REMARKS THIS OUT -- I THINK THE PROPOSAL'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD SO -- HOPE WE CAN DO IT AND LESS -- IN NATURE LOT PEOPLE HAVE WANT TO MAKE COMMENTS AS WELL SO THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND SENATOR D'AMATO -- JORDAN IN THE WITH THE ARE CAN YOU HAD TO PULL THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE -- I CAN BE BRIEF THE THE PROPOSAL ITSELF IS STRAIGHT FORWARD WHAT I JUST WANT TO GIVE EXPLANATION TO IS FOR THE BACKGROUND FOR IT AND THE REASON FOR IT -- WE KNEW GOING IN TO THIS YEAR THAT THIS WAS REALLY A MAKE OR BREAK COUNTY YEAR WHERE WE ARE ON A A CRISIS IN PRESS BUT IT'S WHERE WE ARE IF. INVESTMENT IS NOT MATED. AND THEN -- CRUMBLING WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN OF SERVICES WE WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT WHICH WITH DATA WHICH WE KNEW WE USUALLY -- OUR COMMUNITY -- SOMETIMES IS AND BRING IN WE BRING LOTS OF ANECDOTES SOMETIMES NOT SO MUH DATA. AND SO AS A RESULT WE CONDUCTED A FEW DIFFERENT SURVEYS ONE OF DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS OVER FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED RESPONDED -- INDICATING THAT -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF MANY ARE LIVING -- IN ITS CIRCUMSTANCES OF POVERTY WITH 42% HAVE CHILDREN A MEDI CAL 20% OF THE S. P. IS RECEIVE UP PUBLIC FOOD ASSISTANCE. I'M 36% OF THEMSELVES ARE MEDI CAL ECCENTRIC CETERA WE ALSO DID A SURVEY OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS THEMSELVES 45% OF FIVE HUNDRED AND NINE RESPONDED 45% INDICATED TURNING AWAY OR PLACE ON WAITING LISTS. INDIVIDUALS WITH BEEN REFERRED BY -- REGIONAL CENTERS 49% REPORT DOWNSIZING PROGRAM CAPACITY -- AND SO WE KNEW THAT THIS YEAR WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING ALL OF YOU SEE WILSON WITH THE RATES THAT HE RESULTS IT WAS A COUPLE WE'RE GOING TO BE COMING FORWARD IN MARCH. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE HOWEVER THAT -- ONE WE DON'T KNOW IF THE RATES THAT HE WAS GOING TO COME OUT AND SAY MAYBE WERE OVER FUNDED WE DIDN'T KNOW LIKELY COME OUT AND SAID ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS -- IT WICH WE INTO BELIEVES ABOUT THE RIGHT NUMBER A BILL WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD A PROPOSAL MOVING FORWARD -- AND THAT WOULD PUT MUCH NEEDED INVESTMENT INTO COMMUNITY -- SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH ADD THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND SO -- WE'RE VERY THANKFUL THAT BOTH SENATOR STERN -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF HOLDEN AND ALSO SOME WOMEN FRAZIER -- ON THIS ON THE SIDE ARE PUTTING FORWARD -- LETTERS A REQUEST FOR AN 8% ACROSS THE BOARD INCREASE -- FOR SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. MANY SENATORS HAVE SIGNED ON IN WE DO NOT BELIEVE JUST TO CLARIFY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THIS IS KIND OF CONTRADICTORY TO ANY PROPOSALS TO ANOTHER RATE STUDY BUT RATHER COMPLIMENTARY AND WHAT WE'VE IT'S A DOWN PAYMENT. THIS YEAR WILL THE SECOND CONCERN WE HAD IS THAT NOT ONLY MAYBE YOU WOULD COME BACK WITH A LESSER INVEST IN BUT THAT BE TOO COMPLICATED TO REALLY DO MUCH WITH THIS YEAR. AND THAT SEEMS TO BE AS WE WERE HEARING THERE'S GONNA BE A OT OF CONVERSATIONS WHICH SHE KNEW IT HAPPEN -- IN EARNEST DURING THE SUMMER AND FALL -- WE KNEW THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO LET COMPLICATIONS HOWEVER KEEP US FROM MAKING NEEDED INVESTMENTS WHICH IS WHY WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD WE WE ARE SUPPORTING THAT 8% ASK. BY -- CENTER STERN'S LIMóN HOLDEN FRAZIER -- AND SO WE ARE WE ONE THING WE'VE ALSO HEARD TODAY IS IS DO NO HARM. AND ONE THING THAT WE ARE PUTTING FOR THIS PROPOSAL SAYING THAT.

GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HARD WORK YOU'RE DOING ON THIS PROJECT -- COULD YOU JUST RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU'RE A PARENT THERE. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU'RE EIGHTEEN MONTH OLD WASN'T TALKING YET. OR WASN'T WALKING YET. WILL THAT HAPPEN TO A LITTLE KID -- NAME JOHNNY AND ONE OF OUR SPEECH THERAPISTS FROM EASTER SEALS FOR NON PROFIT WITHOUT THEIR SEEN JOHNNY FOR THE EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM. WELL GUESS WHAT THEY GOT JOHNNY TALKING. HE GOT A DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM HE GOT OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY HE GOT PHYSICAL THERAPY BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER NOT BILL SEPARATE CODES OR SEPARATE -- AMOUNTS AND THEN THEY HAD A CHILD DEVELOPMENT SPECIALISTS HELP HIS FAMILY. JOHNNY IS NOW IN A REGULAR PRESCHOOL AND NO LONGER QUALIFIES FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM. THAT IS WHAT REALLY ENCOURAGING AND DO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. HI THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LISTEN TO OUR CONCERNS TODAY MY NAME IS LEAH HALEY AND I'M ALSO FROM THE EASTER SEAL SUPERIOR IN SACRAMENTO. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE THIRTEEN CHILD DEVELOPMENT SPECIALISTS THAT I SUPERVISE -- THE EIGHT OH FIVE INFILL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO WORK AS A TEAM TO DELIVER EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES IN A TRANCE DISCIPLINARY APPROACH. SEPARATING OUT OF THESE SERVICES WOULD NOT BE CONDUCIVE TO THIS APPROACH AND WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THE POS PROCESS BETWEEN THE REGIONAL CENTER AND THE VENDORS. THERE IS CONCERN FOR OVER THE OVER ESTIMATE OF THE TWENTY SIX WEEKLY VISITS INDICATED IN THE RATE MODEL PROPOSED. THIS MODEL IMPLIES THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE THIRTY SEVEN AND A HALF FULL TIME HOURS PER WEEK WOULD BE USED ON HOME VISITS. THIS DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE TRAVEL TIME BETWEEN CLIENTS WHO ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE IN REMOTE LOCATIONS WHAT IS A CONSIDER THE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO STAY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ID A LAWS. AROUND THE AYE OFFICE P. PROCESS. CBS'S ARE OFTEN USED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILD AND TO REINFORCE THE OUTCOME SET BY THE OTHER DISCIPLINES. THEREFORE SUPPORTING THE FAMILY AND CHILD THROUGHOUT THEIR TIME IN EARLY INTERVENTION. WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSED A PERCENT RATE INCREASE THAT WILL BE CRUCIAL TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICES UNTIL RATE MALL JUST READ THAT COVERS EXPENSES IS ENACTED THANK YOU. THANK YOU[inaudible] WELCOME. MY NAME IS JACKIE CLARK AND I HAVE BEEN A ADMINISTRATOR AND AND PROGRAMS FOR FORTY THREE YEARS. AND I'VE -- HAD GREAT HOPE THAT ONE DAY WILL BE ABLE. TO REVISE THE RATE MODEL SO I'M EXCITED THAT WE'LL GET TO THAT LEVEL. I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT I WANTED TO BRING UP ABOUT THE THE DRAFT PROPOSAL AND I THINK THAT THE TWO BIGGEST FACTORS ARE. THE PRODUCTIVITY ASSUMPTION THAT WE CAN SEE I'M TWENTY SEVEN FAMILIES A WEEK -- WINS IN OUR COUNTY WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND WENTY MILES BETWEEN OUR FOR THIS -- FAMILIES AND SO IT DOES -- TAKE ALL DAVE -- OF TRAVELING TO SEE THREE TO FOUR KIDS ON A DAY SO. REALISTICALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT MORE OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES. A WEEK INSTEAD OF TWENTY SEVEN BUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT IS THE BILLABLE -- RATE PER HOUR WAS REALLY SET ON THAT PRODUCTIVITY LOVERS LEVELS ARE REALLY DROVE THE RATES DOWN. BUT I THINK EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY IS IF WE HAD TO HIRE -- T. SPECIES AND SPEECH ON MEDI CAL RATES BECAUSE WITHOUT THE ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTED BE TWENTY NINE DOLLARS. AND WE PAID. TWENTY NINE DOLLARS JUSTIN TRAVEL FOR THE DAY AND WE WOULD HAVE NOTHING LEFT OVER FOR SALARIES THANK YOU THANK YOU WELCOME. HI MY NAME IS CHRISTINA MICHAEL ALBERS AND I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S THERAPY CENTER WHERE A PRIVATE NON PROFIT WHOSE MISSION IS THAT NO CHILD SHOULD GO THROUGH LIFE WITH A DISABILITY THAT CAN BE AIDED FOR PREVENTED THROUGH EARLY INTERVENTION. WE HAVE BEEN A VENDOR DIFFERENT PROGRAM OF THE REGIONAL CENTER FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS I HAVE TWO ISSUES THAT I WANT TO DRESS VERY QUICKLY REGARDING THE RATE STUDY AND THESE ARE ISSUES THAT WILL DO HARM FIRST THE RECOMMENDATION TO REIMBURSE. INFANT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM THERAPY AT MEDI CAL RATES IS GROSSLY UNSUSTAINABLE IF THAT HAPPENED OUR PROGRAM WOULD SEE A HOURLY RATE WHICH IS ALREADY FORTY FIVE DOLLARS LESS THAN OUR COST. THIS WOULD RESULT IN THE REASON REGIONAL CENTER LOSING US AS A VENDOR AND THE HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN THAT WE SERVE WOULD GO WITHOUT SERVICE. SECOND QUICKLY IS A SEPARATION OF ID P. SERVICES IN TWO DIFFERENT BILLABLE CATEGORIES WOULD RESULT IN A LESS EFFECTIVE EARLY INTERVENTION THE INTENT OF EARLY INTERVENTION IN BOTH REGULATION AND BEST PRACTICE IS TO FOCUS ON THE WHOLE CHILD WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SO. EFFECTIVE. ON DOING THE STRUCTURE THE PROGRAM WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN AN EARLY START THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALSO GIVEN YOU GUYS WILL HAVE OKAY. THANK YOU WELCOME. YES THE DOORS. TIMES -- KERRISON WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE STUDY MUST REFLECT THE VALUES OF INCLUSION INTEGRATION. AND CHOICE AT THE CORE OF THE LANCER MEN ACT THE FEDERAL HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS FINAL RULE AND CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT FIRST LAWS. THE R. C. APPRECIATES THE IMMENSE UNDERTAKING BY TEDIOUS. AND BURNS AND ASSOCIATES. TO COMPLETE A REYES STUDY. AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO REFORM THE RATES RATE SETTING. PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA'S DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO IS NOT AN OPTION AND DEAR SEE SUPPORT SUBSTANTIVE RATE RELATED -- ACTION THIS YEAR HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE RATE STUDY DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS. HOW? THE PROPOSED RATE. METHODOLOGY INCENTIVES OUTCOMES FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES. THESE OUTCOMES INCLUDE INCLUSION INTEGRATION AND CHOICE OF CHOICE AT THE CORE OF THE WOMEN ACT. CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT FIRST LAWS IN THE CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVE INTEGRATION EMPLOYMENT -- BLUEPRINT FOR CHANGE. TOWARD THESE GOALS WE PROPOSE THE FOLLOWING ONE THE RATE STUDY MUST PLACE A GREATER EMPHASIS OUTCOME BASE RATE METHODOLOGIES. PREMISE ON COMMUNITY BASED INTEGRATION AND CHOICE AS THIS IS NECESSARY TO INCENTIVIZE H. B. H. C. B. S. COMPLIANCE. HERNANDEZ COULD WRAP UP -- A CONCLUSION CALIFORNIA HAS A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO TO TAKE SUBSTANTIVE RATE RELATED. ACTION THIS YEAR AND THE FAILURE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY JEOPARDIZES THE HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FEDERAL H.. H. CBS FUNDING THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANKS FOR MUCH WELCOME. I MISS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CARL LONDON -- HERE'S THE ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH -- INTELLECTUAL TO ALMOST DISABILITIES WE SUBMITTED A LETTER TO YOUR STAFF AS WELL TO THE DEPARTMENT SO JUST MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF POINTS -- ONE THE BIGGEST HEADLINE ENDING IN THE ROOM HERE FOR THE WHOLE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE. BASICALLY GETTING A DECLARATION FROM READ STUDIES SAYS THE SYSTEM IS UNDERFUNDED BY OVER A BILLION DOLLARS -- THAT SO THAT CREATES FOR YOU WITH THE RATE STATE WHAT I'M HEARING PRETTY EASILY IS A TODAY IN A TOMORROW PROBLEM. THE TOMORROW PROBLEM IS HOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT THE RATE STUDY WHICH WILL. SORT OF SET THE STABLE FOR THE FUTURE THE TODAY PROBABLY HAVE RECEIVER OVER AND OVER AGAIN LAST COUPLE YEARS. THAT SERVICE PROGRAMS TODAY ARE ADEQUATE WE HAVE A CAPACITY PROBLEM WITH A SHORTAGE OF STAFF PROBLEM. AND YOU HAVE TO SOLVE THAT IMMEDIATELY SO I THINK WHEN YOU LISTEN WITH THE LA -- OFFERS AS AN ALTERNATIVE. THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING SOMETHING TODAY LIKE AN 8% INCREASE WHICH EIGHTEEN OR EXCUSE ME NINETEEN EVERY COLLEAGUES ARE SUPPORTING TODAY IN THE SENATE. HE GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO HANDLE TODAY'S PROBLEM WHILE WE CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION FOR TOMORROW AND FIGURING OUT HOW IT'S GONNA WORK. GIVING I'D SAY JUST BRIEFLY I'M LOOKING BACK AT THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS THE IMPETUS FOR THE RATES STAY IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION THERE THAT WE THINK IT'S BEEN LEFT OUT. THE VERY FIRST BALL IT OF THAT WAS WHETHER OR NOT THE CURRENT METHOD RATE SETTING. PROVIDES AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY PROVIDERS IN THAT CATEGORY. AND WHETHER THERE'S A SUFFICIENT QUIET TO ENABLES SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE BELIEVE THE RATE CITY COMPLETELY IGNORES THAT NEEDS TO BE HANDLED THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME.

BECAUSE WE FEEL WHAT THEY FEEL WHICH IS THAT. ARE THE COST OF LIVING INCREASES EVERY YEAR BUT OUR RATE STAYS THE SAME OUR INCOME STAYS THE SAME AND WE CAN'T TIGHTEN OUR BELTS ANYMORE THAN WE ALREADY HAVE. BUT WE'RE NOT THE ONES THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM THIS THE PARTICIPANTS WE SERVER THE ONES THAT ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH NEW STAFF CONSTANTLY TRYING TO LEARN THEIR JOBS.

HELLO MY NAME IS TO LEAVE AS THE IRA AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS FOR MINUS HOME CARE I WE ARE PRIMARILY A RESPITE AGENCY IN THE EAST BABIES ARE ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED CLIENTS.

MY AGENCY IS CURRENTLY UNDER SIX DIFFERENT LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES AND THREE DIFFERENT SICK LEAVE PALE ORDINANCES -- OUR RATES DO NOT ADEQUATELY SUPPORTED AT ALL -- WE ARE HAVING PROBLEM RETAINING STAFF ATTRACTING STAFF -- AND ALSO IT'S BEEN REALLY DIFFICULT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE -- GOOD EMPLOYMENT A AND TRAINING WILL UP TO OUR STAFF BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE RATES TO SUPPORT SO. WHAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO DO IS TO CONSIDER? POSSIBLY ADDING SOME TYPE OF WAGE DIFFERENTIAL TO THE THE RIGHT MODEL -- FUNNY THE 8% WOULD BE A GREAT START BUT I THINK IT ONGOING METHOD WHICH IS -- WITHIN YOUR SEATTLE IN MATERIALS THAT WERE GIVEN TO YOU EARLIER WOULD BE TO ATTACH SOME THINGS THAT LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES ARE ADDRESSED OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND ACTUALLY WE DID DISCUSS THAT AT A PREVIOUS HEARING CELL. ALL RIGHT. WELCOME. BUT INSTEAD IS I'M FROMMINUS TWO WEEKS I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT WE SERVE A LOT OF MARGINALIZED PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN OUR AGENCY.

THAT MEANS RESPITE. AN IOS AND PERSONAL ASSISTANCE AND SLS. AND SO PLEASE PLEASE HOPEFULLY YOU'LL PAY ATTENTION THAT I WANT TO ADDRESS ONE MORE THING -- AND THAT IS IN -- PUTS BUT DIRECTED EMPLOYER RECORD SERVICES AND RESPITE FOR RESPITE AND THE OTHER PERSONAL SUPPORTS -- WE NEED EMPLOYMENT SUPPORTS. TO BE RESTORED THE RATE STUDY WITHOUT ALL SUPPORTS FOR EMPLOYMENT SPORTS BY RIPPING OUT ALL THE ADMIN. THIS IS -- THIS IGNORES THE CRUCIAL ROLE THAT CMS REQUIRES FOR MATCHING FUNDS TO PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT SUPPORTS THAT GO ALONG WITH THE EMPLOYMENT AUTHORITY. THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHEN THEY DIRECTOR D. S. P.

WE ARE SPONSORING WITH THE CLINICS A POSTAL FOR TWENTY SIX MILLIONDOLLARS TO FIND -- VISION SERVICES IN A CLINIC CLINIC SETTING IT'S ONE TIME ONLY CAPITAL OUTLAY -- WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CLINICS IN CALIFORNIA THEY DO NOT EITHER HAVE THE SPACE OR THE EQUIPMENT TO PROVIDE VISION SERVICES WE THINK THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH CARE ACCESS. TO THIS PROGRAM FIRST OF ALL. WHEN BENEFITTED THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDING VISION SERVICES IN AREAS WHICH THERE THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE CALIFORNIA HAS AN AGING POPULATION THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF VISION RELATED PROBLEMS THAT COME WITH AGING SUCH AS? DIABETIC RETINOPATHY BOMB IN ADDITION YOU HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE SERIOUS UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS WHO DON'T JUST DON'T GO TO SEE A DOCTOR. AND IN FACT THE GO TO SEE A OPTOMETRISTS BECAUSE THEY NEED TO GET AYE GLASSES CAUSING YOU TO DRIVE THE TO READ -- AND SO ONCE YOU GET THEM INTO THE OPTIMISTIC VISION SERVICES EXAM THE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE LOOK FOR SIGNS OF DIABETES. BOB SO ONE OF THE REALLY GREAT BENEFITS TO THIS IDEA IS TO IN ESSENCE TO PROVIDE AN INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE MODEL IN THE IN THESE CLINICS IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE SERVICES. SO WE THINK WOULD BE AS WISE AND SIGNIFICAN IN INVEST SOME BY THE STATE. IN THIS PROGRAM AND ITS ONE TIME ONLY MONEY. THANK YOU I THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM LA -- YES MISTER CHAIR MARK NEWTON FROM THE LA -- JUST ON THIS TOPIC OF VISION RELATED SERVICES JUST FOR THE COMMITTEES INFORMATION -- THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION RELEASED THIS MORNING DOES PROPOSED TO RESTORE OP -- OPTICAL OPTICIAN OPTICAL LAB SERVICES FOR ADULT MEDICAL BEEN FISHERS OKAY AND OTHER PROJECT THAT WE SUPPORTED IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR.

ALL RIGHT NEXT UP IS -- NONPROFIT ACCESS TO THE ASHFORD PUBLIC USE FILE -- WELCOME GLASSES -- A CLASSES TALK ABOUT OPTICAL. YOUR PERSONAL THERE YOU GO. RIGHT WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON -- JOAN ALLEN ON BEHALF OF THIS YEAH YOU YOU H. W. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL BROUGHT FORWARD BY US YEAH YOU STATE COUNCIL. FROM NINETEEN NINETY NINE FOR TWENTY FOURTEEN SEIU AND MANY OTHER STAKEHOLDERS OBTAIN DATA SETS FROM ASHKHABAD CALLED THE PUBLIC USE FILES. OF THESE INCLUDED -- PATIENT LEVEL DE IDENTIFIED DATA FOR HOSPITALS AND FOR AMBULATORY SURGICAL CENTERS. THESE DATA FILES WERE THE ONLY COMPREHENSIVE PATIENT LEVEL PRODUCT THAT ADVOCATES COULD RECEIVE FROM OFF PUT AND THEY'VE BEEN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AS A COMPONENT FOR US YEAH YOU IN TERMS OF OUR WORK EXAMINING UTILIZATION. QUALITY DISPARITIES AND MANY OTHER ISSUES WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. HOWEVER OFFERED HIS REINTERPRETED WHAT DATA MAY BE PUBLICLY RELEASED UNDER EXISTING STATUTE. THIS IS LET US YEAH YOU AND OTHER ADVOCATES LED DOES HE ARE YOU ANOTHER ADVOCATES LOSING ACCESS TO THE DATA CONTAINED IN OUR SPOT PUBLIC USE FILES. SINCE. TWENTY FOURTEEN WITHOUT ACCESS TO THESE FULL DATA SETS SEIU ANOTHER ADVOCATES DO NOT HAVE THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE POLICY MAKING AND REGULATORY PROCESS. WELL SUMMARY DATA THAT IS STILL AVAILABLE FOR MARCH BUT CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND GENERAL TRENDS IT IS INSUFFICIENT FOR INVESTIGATING THE MORE COMPLEX SITUATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE USING THE OFFERED PUBLIC USE FILES WE HAVE EXAMINED DISPARITIES IN MATERNITY CARE BY RACE AND PAYER. AND HAVE SHOWN THE IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES WHEN HOSPITALS REDUCE OR ELIMINATE PARTICULAR LINES OF SERVICE. THE ALL THE INFORMATION OFFERED COLLECTS FROM HOSPITALS AND AMBULATORY SURGICAL CENTERS CAN BRING IMPORTANT DATA DRIVEN VOICE TO THE POLICY MAKING CONVERSATION PARTICULARLY ABOUT EXPANDING ACCESS TO CRITICAL SERVICES. AND IDENTIFYING UNNECESSARY HEALTH CARE COST DRIVERS. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD EXTEND AN EXISTING DATA ACCESS PROCEDURE THAT ALLOWS FOR THE RELEASE OF SENSITIVE EDUCATION RELATED DATA TO ALSO APPLY TO SENSITIVE HEALTH CARE RELATED DATA -- IT WOULD BE SPECIFIC TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN DEMONSTRATE AN ABILITY TO FOLLOW ESTABLISHED DATA SECURITY. PROCEDURES INCLUDING A HUMAN SUBJECTS REVIEW -- MAINTAINING THE DATA IN A SECURED SERVER PLANS AND AGREEMENTS WITH ASHKHABAD. TO ONLY REALLY ONLY RELEASE THE MINIMUM DATA NECESSARY FOR THE RESEARCH PROJECT. AND PLANS TO DESTROY THE DATA ONCE THE RESEARCH PROJECT WAS COMPLETE ALL OF THOSE WERE CONTAINED WITHIN THE INFORMATION IT WITHIN THE DAY TO USE AGREEMENTS. THAT WE HAD WITH US BUT IN THE PAST AND THE MIRROR DATA USE AGREEMENTS THAT S. YEAH YOU AND OTHER ADVOCATES HAVE WITH CMS. TO OBTAIN MEDICARE DATA. AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE MORE COMPREHENSIVE DATA ON THE MEDICARE POPULATION BUT THAT LEAVES US WITHOUT THE INSIGHT INTO HELPING INFORM POLICY ON MEDI CAL. AND ON COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS. THIS PROPOSAL BUILDS ON THE COMMITMENT TO HEALTH CARE DATA TRANSPARENCY THAT THE LEGISLATURE MADE LAST YEAR IN AB. EIGHTEEN TEN WHICH PUT CALIFORNIA ON THE PATH TO CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE CLAIMS DATABASE. HOWEVER THAT AFTER WILL TAKE SEVERAL YEARS. AND IN THE INTERIM WE ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO RESTORE ADVOCATES ACCESS TO THE DATA CONTAINED IN THE OFFERED PUBLIC USE FILES THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM AVAIL. RIGHT QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE SHIFT ICD. TEN AND THAT IS WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OFSHE PART IS THAT THE SHIFT TO ICD. TEN GIVE SUCH MORE GRANULAR DATA. THAT COMBINED WITH THE ABILITY TO LINK IT UP WITH OTHER DATA SETS. THAT AN INCREDIBLY INDUSTRIOUS RESEARCHER COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS. OKAY -- WE FIND THAT. HAS NOT BEEN A CONCERN THAT CMS HAS HA PUT FORWARD THAT THEY FEEL THAT THE DATA USE AGREEMENTS WITH I INDIVIDUALS WITH THREE OTHER THINGS OR NOT. THIRTEEN THESE FILES OUT ON A PUBLIC WEBSITE THIS WOULD ONLY BE TRANSFERRED WITH A DATA SHARING AGREEMENT THAT CONTAINS. CONTRARY L. STRONG CONTRACTUAL PROTECTIONS YES FOR EXAMPLE SCA YOU HAS A HIPPA COMPLIANT SERVER. RIGHT IT'S NOT LIKE -- HERE IT IS ON A THUMB DRIVE RIGHT AND I THINK OKAY.

THESE THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS IS THE DOLLAR AMOUNT RESIDENTS ON MEDI CAL WHO LIVE IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE ALLOWED TO KEEP AFTER THEY PAY THEIR SHARE OF COSTS.

CHEMICAL LEADERSHIP WE JUST HEAR HEART RENDING STORIES OF OF OF RESIDENTS SUFFERING TRULY PERSONAL -- INDIGNITIES HAVING TO DO WITHOUT -- ARE HAVING TO RATION OF PERSONAL ITEMS OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATIONS INCONTINENCE PRODUCTS. ALL OF IT DUE TO HAVING SUCH A OF A MINIMAL MONTHLY INCOME. OF MANY OF THE RESIDENTS THAT ARE IN THESE FACILITIES ONCE ENJOYED A MIDDLE CLASS LIFESTYLE OF OF HAVING TO WIN THREE AND FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH.

LIVING IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY HAVING TO SHARE A ROOM IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY -- RELYING ON MEDI CAL TO TO PAY OVER AND ABOVE WITH THEIR 100% OF THEIR SHARE OF COSTS IT IT IT'S JUST DEMORALIZING.

IT'S JUST NOT OKAY THAT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO MAKE THESE KINDS OF CHOICES -- WHEN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO INCREASE IT TO MAKE US A PAR WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY -- I DO WANT TO POINT OUT ONE OF THE THE BIGGEST ITEMS THAT PEOPLE USE THE THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH FOR HIS CELL PHONES. THERE'S A MISCONCEPTION THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ON MEDICARE YOU CAN GET A FREE PHONE. YOU HAVE TO BE UNDER THAT THRESHOLD SO FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAD A MIDDLE CLASS INCOME.

CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN FOOD INSECURE HOUSEHOLDS HAVE POOR OVERALL HEALTH AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AS WELL AS MORE HOSPITALIZATIONS. THEIR FAMILY SPACE INCREASED RISK OF DIABETES CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN ADDITION TO THE WELL KNOWN UNTOWARD EFFECTS OF TOXIC STRESS.

ANY COMMENTS MILIEU THE OKAY QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALL RIGHT OKAY WELL THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH. COMMITTEE GUARDS ALWAYS GOOD. ALL RIGHT NEXT IS RATE INCREASE FOR PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. OKAY WELCOME. CGB HERE HOLD SERVICES. GOOD EVENING AS SENATOR PAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS JODY HEX REPRESENTING CG. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND WE'RE HERE TO REQUEST SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING. FOR A MEDICAL RATE INCREASE AND I AM IN A GIANT TAKE ONE MINUTE OF YOUR TIME BECAUSE I KNOW THE COMMITTEE IS IS QUITE AWARE. OF LOW MEDICAL RATES AND HOW THAT TRANSLATES INTO AN ACCESS TO CARE PROBLEM -- FOR CALIFORNIANS I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS POPULATION AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES -- MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE ADMITTED TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ANNUALLY IN CALIFORNIA. ABOUT 66% OF THOSE RELY SOLELY ON MEDI CAL SO ABOUT THREE OUT OF FIVE PATIENTS AND OF THOSE MORE THAN SIXTY SIX THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. THAT RESIDE IN THOSE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HAVE EXPERIENCE SOME SORT OF TRAUMA% ONE IN TWENTY FOUR CALIFORNIANS SUFFER FROM SOME SORT OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND MANY OF THOSE ARE JUST NOT GETTING. CARE BECAUSE OF OUR LOW MEDI CAL RATES AND AND PARTICULARLY -- WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON IS IT IS A BROADER -- HOMELESS POPULATION THAT ARE BEING pAFFECTED BY THIS SO MANY ARE COME IN THROUGH THE EMERGENCY ROOM THEY BE GET REFERRED TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AND BECAUSE THE THE CARE JUST ISN'T THERE TO TREAT THEM FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THERE OFTENTIMES AND DISCHARGED BACK ONTO THE STREETS AND WE KNOW -- THOSE PATIENTS ARE MORE -- LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIME OR TO BE THEN. ADMITTED BACK INTO A HEALTH FACILITY -- ALSO THERE'S A RECENT STUDY THAT HAS SHOWN THAT -- SUICIDE RATES IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE ARE RISING SO ABOUT TWO POINT 2% OF SUICIDES IN THAT AGING POPULATION COME SO WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR AN INCREASE IN RATES SUCH THAT -- ACCESS CAN BE BETTER PROVIDED FOR FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH FOR AGING POPULATION AND AND THEY JUST DESERVE BETTER CARE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU COMMENTS MILLIONS. OKAY QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALL RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH OKAY -- NEXUS UP AS POSSIBLE. GRAHAM THAT IT FELL QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS. WE HAVE TROUBLE P. AMERICA WELCOME. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN SENATOR -- RANDY I'M A MY CHILD CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST I'M BASED IN ORANGE COUNTY AND I WORK WITH ABOUT HALF OF THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE TO IMPLEMENT POSITIVE PARENT TEEN. THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU WOULD APPROPRIATE EIGHT MILLION TO EQUIP COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS FQHC IS A RURAL HEALTH CLINICS WITH AN ONLINE. EVIDENCE BASED POSITIVE PARENTING PROGRAM TO WEB BASED APPROACH THAT CAN SCALE ACROSS THE STATE. I REPRESENT ONE SUCH PROGRAM TRIPLE P. WHICH IS A SYSTEM OF PARENTING SUPPORT DESIGNED TO IMPROVE BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN TEENAGERS AND FAMILIES. WITH THE EIGHT MILLION WE CONSERVE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES OKAY ASSUMING TWO KIDS PER FAMILY THAT'S TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND KIDS. POTENTIALLY BENEFITING FROM THIS APPROACH SO IT CAN REALLY SCALE. FQHCS ARE IDEAL SETTINGS TO TILT TO DELIVER PARENTING INFORMATION. PARENT TEEN IMPACTS IN MEDIATES VIRTUALLY ALL ASPECTS OF CHILD HEALTH. IT'S DIFFICULT TO THINK OF ONE ASPECT THAT DOESN'T DEPEND UPON PARENTS INCLUDING WHETHER KID MAKES IT TO AN APPOINTMENT. IN PRACTICE EVIDENCE BASED PARENTING INFORMATION HASN'T BEEN TRANSMITTED TO PARENTS AS WELL AS IT COULD AND THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A LACK OF RESOURCES. THE PC PEAS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAFF SIMPLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO PARENTING E. BP'S. SO THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES ACCESS TO PARENTS WHO DESIRE PARENTING INFORMATION. AND THE INFORMATION IS STRENGTHENED BECAUSE THE REFERRALS INTO THE SYSTEM COME FROM A TRUSTED SOURCE YOUR DOCTOR AND PEER PA. YOUR SOCIAL WORKER. THERE IS A WIDENING GAP BETWEEN BEST PRACTICES AND STANDARDS OF CARE FOR WORKING WITH FOR EXAMPLE CHILDREN WITH ADHD OR SOME OTHER DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS IN THE SETTINGS. NON PHARMACOLOGIC EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS FOR THESE PROBLEMS EXIST THEY WORK AND ARE PROMOTED BY THE CDC AN H. P.. BUT WE ARE STILL FACED WITH BARRIERS AND ACCESS AND DELIVERY WE KNOW PARENTS SEEK THIS INFORMATION ONLINE. OKAY THREE DAYS AGO I DID A GOOGLE SEARCH FOR PARENTING HELP AND I GOT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION HITS IN POINT FOUR SECONDS. SO WHERE IS A PARENT SUPPOSED TO START OKAY SEARCH ALGORITHM BUSINESS IT ISN'T SMART ENOUGH YET TO DETECT EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS FROM EVERYTHING ELSE SO PARENTS REALLY NEED HELP. THIS PROPOSAL EQUIPS HEALTH CENTERS WITH THE ABILITY. TO MAKE A GOOD REFERRAL INTO A CLINICALLY TESTED PROGRAM AN EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM AND THAT IS THE HIGHEST STANDARD IN THE FIELD TODAY. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS PROPOSAL HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. I THANK YOU WELL. ANYONE WHO FOR SCHOOLS PARENTING DON'T GOOGLE VACCINES THAT ANYWAY. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT LA YOU COMES NOW QUESTIONS REMEMBERS OKAY. ALL RIGHT WILL CERTAINLY PARENTING SUPPORT IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT NEXT UP MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT REIMBURSEMENT -- COMMITTEES WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR PENCIL HER TITLE JOHN VALENCIA HERE ON BEHALF OF ALL COMMITTEES WHICH IS A MANUFACTURER OF A MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT LONG ACTING INJECTABLE -- THAT RACKS ONCE MONTHLY AND IS NOT A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE. IT'S READILY AVAILABLE. FOR DELIVERY IN AVAILABILITY FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PATIENTS. IN NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROGRAMS NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO SUPPORT -- MAKE AVAILABLE TO ALL PATIENTS THE ARRAY OF MEDICATION SISTER TREATMENTS. WE'RE BEFORE YOU WITH A BUDGET TRAILER BILL -- RUDE LANGUAGE REQUEST THAT RESOLVES TO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IDENTIFIED IMPEDIMENTS TO FULL AVAILABILITY OF MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENTS IN THOSE SETTINGS. IMPEDIMENT NUMBER ONE THAT WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT AS EARLY AS JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN SHORTLY AFTER THE ENACTMENT OF THE OF THE OPERATIVE THE FACT OF THE LEGISLATION. IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIDN'T PROVIDE FUNDING EVEN THOUGH NO FUNDING FOR ANCILLARY SERVICES PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT. BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION EVEN SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS YOUR ANALYSIS TO SEE IF PATIENTS WERE. TRYING TO RETURN TO THEIR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AFTER A DRUG OF CHOICE. THAT THE LEGISLATURE ASSOCIATED DID NOT PROVIDE ASSOCIATED FUNDING FOR THOSE SERVICES WHILE AT AUTHORIZED THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING. FOR MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENTS THE LANGUAGE THAT WE ARE PROPOSED TO YOU SAYS. DEPARTMENT PLEASE ADVISE US ON WHAT THAT SON SHOULD BE. THAT'S OBJECTIVE NUMBER ONE AN IMPEDIMENT NUMBER ONE IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT IMPEDIMENT NUMBER TWO IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT IS. THEY PURPORT AND ASSERTED BEFORE SUBCOMMITTEES THAT THEY DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC DIRECTION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS THAT WOULD IMPLEMENT. REIMBURSEMENT CODES AND RATES FOR THOSE VERY SAME ANCILLARY SERVICES WITHOUT WHICH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PATIENTS HAVE VERY LITTLE PROSPECTS OF SUCCEEDING IN OVERCOMING THEIR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. SO WE'RE NOT BEFORE YOU REQUESTING SPECIFIC FUNDING BUT RATHER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REMOVE TO DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIED IMPEDIMENTS TO MAKE. AN EIGHTIES FULLY AVAILABLE I WOULD CLOSE BY NOTING THAT IN TODAY'S MAY REVISION. CORRECTIONS IS GETTING AN INFUSION OF SUPPORT FOR WHAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A AN INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE TREATMENT PROGRAM THAT WAY. WELL INMATES ARE STILL INCARCERATED OR ON HE WAY OUT OF INCARCERATION WILL MAKE ALL MEDICATIONS SISTER TREATMENTS. THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE PATIENT AVAILABLE. THEY MAY START OFF CORRECTLY BEHIND BARS BUT IF THEY MEET A NARCOTIC TREATMENT PROGRAM ON THE OUTSIDE THAT ISN'T ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES. THEY'RE GONNA GET LESS ON THE OUTSIDE THEN THEY'LL GET BEHIND THE BARS UNDER THE CURRENT PROPOSAL WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE LANGUAGE. THANK YOU COMES FROM ILLEGAL NO QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH ALL APPRECIATE. OKAY NEXT UP TAKE TAYLOR ADULT DAY HEALTH CENTER FUNDING. THE KILLER CENTER WELCOME. IS THIS A GOOD AFTERNOON BUT GOOD EARLY EVENING ACTUALLY -- I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AND AND THE STAFF HERE FOR ALLOWING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING -- MY NAME IS KAREN MILLER AND THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR AT THE PEG TAYLOR CENTER WE ARE THE ONLY ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE CENTER IN BUTTE COUNTY. WHICH SERVES A HIGH POPULATION OF OLDER ADULTS WHO MAKE UP ALMOST 30% OF THE PARADISE COMMUNITY. OUR MISSION IS TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS IN CARE GIVERS EXPERIENCING HEALTH CRISES SUCH AS STROKES PARKINSON'S DISEASE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND OTHER DISABLING CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH WHEN THE CAMP FIRE BROKE OUT OUR PARTICIPANTS FROM PARADISE MAY GALIA AND OTHER IMPACTED AREAS WERE SAFE BECAUSE THEY HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT OUR CENTER. OR OVER THE COURSE OF THAT FIRST DAY ALMOST ALL OF THEM LOST THEIR HOMES. WE WERE ABLE TO SHELTER THEM SAFELY UNTIL THEY WERE REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILIES WHICH WAS. QUITE A FEAT IF YOU COULD IMAGINE BECAUSE THEIR FAMILIES WERE IN SHELTERS AND ON THE ROAD -- WE SHELTER THEM UNTIL THEY'RE EVACUATED CARE GIVERS COULD GET TOGETHER AND THEN WE WORKED UNTIL THE FIRE DANGER HAD PASSED TO ENSURE THAT ALL OUR PARTICIPANTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY STATE SAFE. SIX MONTHS LATER BUTTE COUNTY REMAINS HEAVILY IMPACTED IN THIS TIME WE FIELDED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED URGENT REQUESTS FOR HELP FROM FAMILIES COPING WITH OVERWHELMING LOSS. AS WELL AS DIFFICULT HOUSING PLACEMENTS WITH HELP DISABLED SENIORS LIVING WITHOUT HEAT OR UNABLE TO ACCESS BEATING FACILITIES OR PREPARE MEALS IN THE AREAS IN THE PLACES WHERE THEY'RE STAYING. CARE GIVER AFTER CARE GIVER HAS EXPRESSED HOW HARD IT IS TO TRY TO RECOVER WHILE CARING FOR AN ILL ELDERLY OR DISABLED FAMILY MEMBER. OUR FIRST WALK IN WAS A CARE GIVER WHOSE MOTHER IN LAW WAS A HUNDRED AND THREE AND SHE WAS HAVING TO SIT IN THEIR CAR FOR HOURS. IN THE SMOKE AND THE COLD AIR WHILE THEY NAVIGATED FEMA AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT TOOK HOURS AND HOURS. WE QUICKLY ENROLLED HER FOR CARE WE EXPEDITED ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO US FROM REALLY QUICKLY. OVERALL WE'VE HAD A 45% INCREASE IN PROGRAM REFERRALS AND WE'RE GOING FULL BORE TO ADDRESS THEM AS FAST AS WE CAN. THE PIG TAYLOR CENTER HAS THE FACILITY CAPACITY TO ROLL IN ROLL UP TO FIFTY MORE PARTICIPANTS. BUT EACH ONE OF THEM IS IN CRISIS SO THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FUNDING BEING REQUESTED BY SENATOR NIELSEN IS URGENTLY NEEDED. SO WE CAN ADD THE NECESSARY SOCIAL WORK NURSING STAFF AND OTHER STAFF. AND IN ROLL THIS MANY NEW INDIVIDUALS WHILE PROVIDING CARE. WRAPPING OUR SAFETY NET OF SERVICES AROUND THESE FAMILIES IS CRITICAL AS WE HEAD INTO ANOTHER HOT SUMMER AND WILL REDUCE THE IMPACT OF OUR COUNTY'S EMERGENCY SERVICES. THE FUNDING WILL ALSO PROVIDE SUBSIDIZED CARE FOR FAMILIES WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL THEREBY AIDING CARE GIVERS WHOSE ECONOMIC STABILITY HAS BEEN THREATENED THROUGH THE LOSS OF THEIR HOMES AND LIVELIHOODS. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THOMAS MILIEU. QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE TO I KNOW YOU'RE SERVING -- A COMMUNITY THAT WAS WELL SEVERELY CHALLENGED ME UNDERSTATEMENT.

ALL RIGHT SO WE NEED A PEOPLE COVER OKAY ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER EXPANSION -- ALRIGHT WE HAVE OUR BUDS BEEN ASSOCIATION BACTERIA WELCOME. GOOD EVENING THIS IS LISA COLEMAN WITH CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION AND I WISH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS HERE FOR THIS. ONE BECAUSE AFTER SUCH A LONG. EMOTIONALLY DRAINING DAY AND I'VE SUCH GREAT EMPATHY FOR YOUR STAFF. I GET TO COME BEFORE YOU IS SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY SAVES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MONEY. IT IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF LIFE IT MAKES EVERYBODY HAPPY YEAH HEY WHAT A WAY TO END THE DAY. SO. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT A BUDGET REQUEST FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO INCLUDE A ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES OVER A FOUR YEAR INCREASE. TO THE ASSISTED LIVING WAVING PROGRAM TO INCREMENTALLY EXPAND THE CURRENT PROGRAM EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SLOTS BY MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE KHALKHAL IS A MEMBERSHIP ASSOCIATION COMPRISED OF THE LOCAL LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN SIR STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS. IT IS WITH GROWING URGENCY AND FREQUENCY THAT OUR LEADERSHIP ARE REPORTING OF INCREASING NUMBERS OF CALLS. CALLS FROM VERY FRUSTRATED AND OFTEN FRANTIC OLDER ADULTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS AT A LOSS AS TO WHERE TO FIND IT HOW TO FORD LONG TERM CARE. THIS GROWING NUMBER OF VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS BOTH OLDER ADULTS AND ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES ARE SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS OF OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY RESIDING IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES A UTILIZING VERY EXPENSIVE CARE AT AN AVERAGE OF SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS -- AND THEN WE HAVE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE IN DESPERATE NEED. FOR ADDITIONAL CARE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO AFFORD THE AVERAGE MONTHLY ASSISTED LIVING RATE PRIVATE PAY THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THEN FOR THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO MAKE BALK MAKE USE OF THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THE NINE HOURS A DAY JUST DOESN'T COVER THEIR NEEDS. SO WHILE WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE DEPARTMENT FOR LAST YEAR INCREASING THE PROGRAM BY AN ADDITIONAL TWO THOUSAND SLOTS. THE PROGRAM IS STILL WOEFULLY. INSUFFICIENT FOR THE NEED AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT THE WAIT LIST CONTINUES TO GROW. OMBUDSMAN'S REPORT OF HEARTBREAKING STORIES OF INDIVIDUALS FINALLY GETTING TO THE TOP OF THE WAIT LIST ONLY TO FIND THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER QUALIFIED. BECAUSE THEY HAVE GROWN TO GUILTY SAFELY UTILIZED ASSISTED LIVING. THIS IS THE MOST TIMELY OF REQUEST SENATOR DODD JUST LAST WEEK ONE OF HIS CONSTITUENTS WAS IN THE NEWS. A WOMAN WHO WAS A HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS OLD A HOSPICE WOMAN WHO WAS WHEELED INTO A COURT -- AN EVICTION HEARING FOR FAILURE TO PAY IN ASSISTED LIVING AFTER HAVING FUN.

IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE THE STATE IN LEGISLATIVE POLICY TO MOVE PEOPLE FROM INSTITUTIONS COMMUNITY SETTINGS WHERE CERTAINLY WHERE WHERE APPROPRIATE. OKAY WELL SO I THINK ILL I MEAN SOMETIMES WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT WHAT IS THE EXACT AMOUNT THE BEST OF THE CLEARLY WE ARE. NOT THERE YET SO WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY AWAY. ABSOLUTE OKAY IT'S IT'S GROWING VERY QUICKLY AND THEN. THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALREADY EXPRESSED AN INTEREST OF OF MERGING THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER INTO THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE. PERHAPS IN FOUR YEARS WHICH IS A STATE WIDE PROGRAM SO IT WOULD JUST BE OKAY HE WHEN THE BALL OUT RIGHT THANK YOU EXTRA MUCH ALL RIGHT. TEXAS MEDICAL INTERPRETER PILOT HAS ASKED ME HERE THERE YOU GO WELCOME. I THINK WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS SINCE I CAME IN THE LEGISLATURE. INDEED WE HAVE SIR.

UM FOR MANY YEARS NOW TO LAUNCH A PILOT PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA COMPREHENSIVELY ASSESS THE WELL KNOWN DEFICIENCIES IN MEDI CAL -- PROGRAM WITH RESPECT -- TO DELIVERY OF MEDICAL INTERPRETATION SERVICES -- AND DURING OUR WORK IN THE BUDGET PROCESS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ON THIS ISSUE A NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE LEADERS AND CONSTITUENCY CAUCUSES WERE CLEAR. THAT NOT ONLY DID STATE LEGISLATORS AND UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE -- BUT THEY INTENDED ACTIVELY WORK WITH US IN OF OTHERS IN THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY UP TO STUDY THE EXTENT OF LANGUAGE ACCESS -- TO MEDICAL INTERPRETATION SERVICES -- THE ORIGINAL -- BILL -- AB SIX THREE FIVE I WENT TO PLACE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IT WAS SLATED TO GO INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY FIRST -- THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES DID NOT RELEASE AN RP UNTIL APRIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH IS MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE -- AND NEARLY TWO YEARS -- FROM THE PASSAGE OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET -- THE DEPARTMENT DID SELECT THE VENDOR TO CONDUCT A STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND AND DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND FINALIZE THAT AGREEMENT EARLIER THIS YEAR -- BUT GIVEN THE EXISTING STATUTES EXPIRATION IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WE WE'RE RECENTLY CONCERNED AT THAT WILL LEAVE US VIRTUALLY NO TIME TO CONDUCT. A LEGITIMATE POWER PROJECT ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE DEPARTMENT'S INTERPRETATION OF THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE -- PREVENTS US FROM BEGINNING APOLLO PROJECT CONTROLS THE STUDIES UNDER -- THIS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY IS COMPLETE -- SO. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS THE STATION PRO TEM INTRODUCE SB ONE SIX FIVE THIS YEAR WHICH EXTENDS TO SUNSET THE BUT ALSO A D. COUPLES TO STUDY -- FROM THE THE POWER PROJECTS THAT WILL CALL FOR BUT IN THE PROCESS OF THAT WE FOUND THAT ONLY ABOUT THAT ALL OF THE MONEY THAT WAS AB ALLOCATIVE TOOK FOR BOTH TO STUDY IN THE PILOT PROJECT WAS USED JUST ON THE STUDY PORTION ALONE -- AND SO WE'RE BEFORE YOU TODAY WITH A ONE TIME FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST -- THAT WE BELIEVE FULFILLS THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS STATUTE OF IMPLEMENTING -- POLLOCK PROJECTS TO BEGIN THE STUDY TO LACK OF LANGUAGE ACCESS THAT EXIST IN OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE -- AND AND JUST QUICKLY -- THE REASON WHY THIS CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE EARLIER THIS YEAR AT THE THERE WAS AN AUDIT OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THAT FOUND THE DH CS HAS DONE LITTLE TO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES. ARE AWARE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF INTERPRETERS TO MINIMIZE THE USE OF CHILDREN -- AND CUSTODIAL STAFF OF THE HOSPITAL WORKERS -- FOR INTERPRETATION SERVICES SO WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THIS IS A PROBLEM -- AND HOPE THAT -- WE CAN TAKE STEPS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO REQUEST FUNDING IN SUPPORT OF A PROPOSED STATEWIDE EXPANSION OF THE LITTLE BY LITTLE SCHOOL READINESS PROGRAM. THE LITTLE BY LITTLE SCHOOL READINESS PROGRAM IS AN EVIDENCE BASED EARLY LITERACY PROGRAM ADMINISTERED THROUGH WEEK CENTERS. THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED GREAT SUCCESS AND RETURN ON INVESTMENT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. HELLO TO HELP DECIDED TO DEVELOP LITTLE BY LITTLE BECAUSE TIME AGAIN RESEARCHERS SHOWN THE CHILDREN FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES FALL BEHIND IN LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT VERY EARLY IN LIFE AS YOUNG AS AGE. THREE AND ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN FALLING BEHIND THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO CATCH UP. IN FACT CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY HERE FEWER THAN ONE THIRD OF THE WORDS HEARD BY CHILDREN FROM HIGHER INCOME FAMILIES. AND EARLY RESEARCH STUDY BY HARDEN RISLEY FOUND THE BY THREE YEARS OF AGE THERE IS AN ESTIMATED THIRTY MILLION WORD GAP. IN LANGUAGE HEARD BETWEEN pPOOREST FAMILIES. WITH SUPPORT OF FIRST BY THE LADY WHO HELPED LAUNCH LITTLE BY LITTLE IN. TWO THOUSAND THREE AS A PILOT PROGRAM AND OPERATED IT AND SIX SITES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. IN ITS FIVE YEAR PILOT PHASE FROM 200-032-2000 EIGHT LITTLE BY LITTLE REACHED A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN BETWEEN BIRTH TO AGE FIVE AND PROVED REMARKABLY EFFECTIVE. A RESEARCH STUDY FROM THIS PILOT PHASE REVEALED THAT WITH WITH CHILDREN WHO HAVE RECEIVED LITTLE BY LITTLE SERVICES. AT HIGHER SCHOOL READINESS IN LANGUAGE SCORES THAN THOSE WITH CHILDREN WHO HAD NOT. WE ARE SUBMITTING A COPY OF RESEARCH PUBLISHED IN PEDIATRICS FOR YOUR REVIEW. GIVEN THE EVIDENCE THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE WORKS FIRST FIVE REFUNDED THE PROGRAM IN TWENTY TWELVE FOR TEN YEARS.

LITTLE BY LITTLE CURRENTLY SERVES MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND LOW INCOME PARTICIPANTS IN TEN WEEKS SITES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE THOUSAND WITH PARTICIPANTS IN FIVE SITES IN TULSA OKLAHOMA. IT IS OUR BELIEF THAT THIS PROGRAM CAN BE GREATLY EXPANDED TO REACH A LARGER PORTION OF THE NEARLY ONE MILLION LOW INCOME PARTICIPANTS. THAT ARE SERVED EACH YEAR THROUGH CALIFORNIA'S WITH PROGRAM. BUT USING THE WEB PLATFORM FOR PROGRAM DELIVERY PROGRAM COSTS REMAIN LOW AVERAGING ONLY FIFTY TWO DOLLARS ER CHILD PER YEAR. IN ADDITION WEEK SITES ARE ONE OF THE FEW PLACES THAT YOUNG FAMILIES VISIT REGULARLY FROM THE MOTHER'S PREGNANCY THROUGH THE CHILD'S FIFTH BIRTHDAY. MAKING THEM UNIQUELY SUITABLE FOR EVIDENCE BASED EARLY LITERACY PROGRAMS LIKE THIS.

BRIEFLY DOES IS VERY IMPORTANT SO ON AVERAGE PARTICIPANTS COME TO WORK ABOUT FOUR TIMES A YEAR AFTER A CHILD'SFIRST YEAR OF LIFE AS YOU KNOW -- THE AND IF THE CHILD AS WELL THEY COME TO A PEDIATRICIAN MAYBE ONE TIME A YEAR SO SO AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE PETE. IT'S ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE RELAXED THEY HAVE REALLY LONG AND STABLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH WHAT PROVIDERS WITH AS THEY MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE STRESSED THEIR CHILD IS ILL. THE PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE THEY MAY NOT HERE -- IF THEIR MESSAGING AROUND READING AS MUCH OF A REACH OUT REDUCE BUILT DURING WELL CHILD VISITS SO IT'S STERN OUNCE PORTERHOUSE AROUND NOT SAYING THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY PERHAPS WORK TOGETHER.

DATA COLLECTION AND DISEASE SURVEILLANCE ARE CUR OUR RESEARCH WE SIMPLY NEED YOUR HELP TO TRANSFER EXISTING LOCAL SYSTEMS DOLLARS TO STATE OPERATIONS TO CONDUCT THE CDC. DISEASE SURVEILLANCE ALL FIFTY STATES ARE ASKED TO CONDUCT THE SURVEY WHEN CALIFORNIA PARTICIPATED IN THE SURVEY LAST IN.

BUT THAT FUNDING RUNS OUT THIS YEAR THOUSANDS OF CASES HAVE ALREADY BEEN REPORTED TO THE REGISTRY AND THOUSANDS MORE ARE ARRIVING THIS MONTH AS MEDICAL GROUPS AND HOSPITALS BEGIN TO SUBMIT THEIR PATIENT DATA. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH JUST GOT THE PARKINSON'S PROGRAM OFF THE GROUND AND WE BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL TO CONTINUE FUNDING SO IT CAN EXPAND AND IMPROVE IN THE COMING YEARS. THE MICHAEL J. FOX FOUNDATION IS A NONPROFIT DEDICATED TO FINDING A CURE FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE THEY PROVIDED THE MOST FUNDING TO CALIFORNIA OF ANY STATE FOR RESURGENT THERAPIES. THE FOUNDATION'S EFFORTS TOGETHER WITH THE DEPARTMENTS REGISTRY WILL GREATLY BENEFIT CALIFORNIANS. PARKINSON'S DISEASE IS A CHRONIC DEGENERATIVE NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER THAT AFFECTS ONE IN ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE OVER AGE SIXTY GET INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED AS YOUNG AS EIGHTEEN LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW PARKINSON'S IMPACTS DIFFERENT POPULATION GROUPS AND IF THE PATTERNS. OF THE DISEASE ARE CHANGING OVER TIME CALIFORNIANS A LARGE AND DIVERSE POPULATION MAKES IT IDEAL FOR THE REGISTRY TO EXPAND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PARKINSON'S AND PROVIDE IMPORTANT CLUES TO THE CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS OF THE DISEASE. THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH DID AS MUCH AS THEY COULD WITH A LIMITED ORIGINAL FUNDING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THE NEW FUNDING WE'RE REQUESTING WILL HELP THE DEPARTMENT IMPROVE AND EXPAND THE REGISTRY TO MAXIMIZE ITS BENEFIT FOR RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND CALIFORNIANS.

FROM SENATOR BELL AND THERE'S A SIMILAR QUESTION TO MEMBER GIPSON ON THIS ON THE SIDE WE'RE ASKING FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND I'M GOING FUNDING TO SUPPORT IS DROP IN CENTERS. THE THE COMMISSION IS SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS REALLY LOOKING AT THIS MODEL THAT WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED IN AUSTRALIA AND EXPANDED AROUND THE WORLD ACTUALLY WE WERE ABLE TO VISIT WITH THAT THE SITES IN VANCOUVER AND WE PRIDE IN FOLKS FROM CANADA AS WELL AS AUSTRALIA TO MEET WITH. COUNTIES IT REALLY IS AN AMAZING MODEL. AND THERE'S EVIDENCE. PRIMARILY OUT OF AUSTRALIA BUT EMERGING EVIDENCE IN CANADA. THAT THIS IDEA OF DESIGNING USE DROP IN CENTERS WITH KEY CHARACTERISTICS THAT IT IS YOUTH DRIVEN USE BRANDON IS PROMOTED. THAT IT PROVIDES INTEGRATED CARE FROM MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT ALSO COMPONENT CARE AROUND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN SUPPORT FOR HOUSING EMPLOYMENT EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES AS WELL. CAN BETTER SERVE USE PRIMARILY BECAUSE USE ARE MORE WILLING TO ACCESS THESE SERVICES BECAUSE OF THEIR ROLE ON THE FRONT END WE'RE ALSO SEEING THAT THERE'S GREATER PERSISTENCE IN TERMS OF THE DELIVERY OF CARE PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE INTEGRATION. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT OUTCOMES IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY. THE FUNDING REQUEST IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT MANY COUNTIES DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO START THIS INITIATIVE AND IT WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO REALLY SHAPE. THE AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES STATEWIDE AND SO THE REQUEST IS FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT -- ANNUALLY ON GOING -- IN REALLY INTENDED TO SUPPORT OUR ABILITY TO RESOURCE COUNTIES TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO BRING THEM TOGETHER AS A LEARNING COLLABORATIVE TO DO THE RESEARCH AND EVALUATION TO UNDERSTAND HOW BEST THIS MODEL WORKS. INCLUDED IN THAT OF COURSE AS YOU UNDERSTAND IS THE CAPACITY TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDS AND OTHER FUNDS OVER TIME. SANTA CLARA AS THEY ROLLED THIS OUT AS OUR FIRST SITE IS DOING THIS IN A WAY THAT THEY'RE SERVING ALL COMERS IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT ALL KINDS WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED THAT THIS IS A MODEL THAT REALLY WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO DESIGN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND WAYS THAT ARGUES CENTRIC.

PROBLEM WITH THE COUNTY BE ABLE HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION -- AS YOU'RE AWARE UNDER CURRENT LAW COUNTIES HAVE A VERY LIMITED TIME TO COMPLETE AN ENTIRELY SPEND THEIR APPROVED DOLLARS FOR IMAGES A INNOVATION PROJECTS. SO CVH DA'S REQUESTING THAT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT A TECHNICAL CHANGE TO THE MENTAL SERVICES ACT FOR THE FINANCING OF THESE INNOVATION PROJECTS. OFTENTIMES SIMPLE THINGS LIKE CONTRACTING NIMBY IS THEM -- LOCAL POLITICS OR ROBUST COMMUNITY PLANNING PROCESS WILL CREATE. UNAVOIDABLE DELAYS TO THE PROJECTS THAT COUNTIES TO JUST SIMPLY CANNOT CONTROL. THESE IMPEDIMENTS CAN PREVENT COUNTIES FROM OPERATIONALIZE IN PROGRAMS IN A TIMELY WAY SO IN RESPONSE TO THIS RASKIN THAT THE CURRENT PROVISION BE REMOVED AND INSTEAD EACH PROJECT TIMELINE BE LINKED. TO THE APPROVAL PROCESS WHEN IT'S HER DURING THE COMMISSION. WITH THIS CHANGE COUNTIES WILL BE ABLE TO FURTHER CREATE CROSS COUNTY COLLABORATIONS AND HELP FURTHER THE INTENT OF THE M. AND JUST SAY.
