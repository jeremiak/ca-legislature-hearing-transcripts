SUGGESTED TOPIC TO LIMIT MY

COMMENTS TO THAT I WILL NOTE

00:17:09.495 --> 00:17:10.696
THAT THE OTHER TWO THEMES

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:12.398
GOING ON IN CINEMA COUNTY WHERE

00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:14.166
WE'RE HEADQUARTERED ONE IS THE

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:16.468
FORMAL A THEME WE'VE ADOPTED

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.904
OF US ENORMOUS STRONG LET ME

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.539

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:22.007
FOR THE PAST YEAR THERE'S A

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:23.742
SECOND THEME THAT EXPLAINS IT

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:26.879
ALL IT SO NORMA ON CERTAIN WE

00:17:26.945 --> 00:17:29.715
HAVE FIRE VICTIMS WHO STILL IN

00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:31.650
GREAT NUMBERS DO NOT KNOW WHAT

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:32.785
THEY'RE GOING TO DO WHETHER

00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:34.653
THEY CAN AFFORD TO REBUILD

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.822
OR EVEN WANT TO REBUILD THE

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:38.824
OF FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS I

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.026
MIGHT ALSO NOTE ON THE AGENDA

00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:42.261
IS THE ONLY OTHER THING I

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:43.695
MIGHT CORRECT THE THE TITLE

00:17:43.762 --> 00:17:45.497
OF OUR SESSIONS NOT CORRECT

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.266
BUT SUPPLEMENT IS REBUILDING

00:17:47.332 --> 00:17:49.067
AFTER THE FIRE WILL LET ME

00:17:49.134 --> 00:17:50.235
TELL YOU WHAT'S REALLY GOING

00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:52.538
ON OUT THERE IS IT'S BUILDING

00:17:52.604 --> 00:17:54.907
AFTER THE FIRE NOT NECESSARILY

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:56.341
REBUILDING I'VE TALKED A

00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:58.644
HUNDRED TO CONTRACTORS --

00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.912
BUILDING OFFICIALS THROUGHOUT

00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:02.281
THE AREA AND LESS THAN FIVE

00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:04.283
PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO LOST A

00:18:04.349 --> 00:18:06.318
HOME I REPEAT LESS THAN FIVE

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:07.753
PERCENT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.555
GOING TO ACTUALLY REBUILD THE

00:18:09.621 --> 00:18:11.957
HOME THAT THEY LOST AND IT'S

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:13.826
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS OLDER

00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:16.495
FOLKS DON'T WANT TO STORY HOMES

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:17.796
ANYMORE THEY WANT ONE STORY

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:19.698
HOMES -- THERE OF AS AS THEY

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.133
SETTLE UP ON INSURANCE ARE

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.035
FINDING OUT THERE FOUR THOUSAND

00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:24.636
SQUARE FOOT HOME WAS INSURED

00:18:24.703 --> 00:18:26.505
FOR WHAT WILL REBUILD AT TWENTY

00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:27.739
FIVE HUNDRED TO TWENTY EIGHT

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:29.475
HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT HOME THERE

00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:30.442
ARE OTHERS WHO ARE GOING TO

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:32.144
RETIRE ANYWAY WANTED TO MOVE

00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:34.079
AWAY WHATEVER AND A WHOLE LOT

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:36.815
OF PEOPLE ARE REBUILDING A HOME

00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:37.883
THAT'S DIFFERENT TO WHAT THEY

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.117
HAD BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS WANTED

00:18:39.184 --> 00:18:40.486
THE UPGRADE AN UPDATE THAT

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:42.321
HOME SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF

00:18:42.387 --> 00:18:44.356
REBUILDING AND BUILDING THAT'S

00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:46.792
GOING ON TOPICS QUICKLY THAT

00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:48.260
WAS ASKED TO ADDRESS WHAT'S

00:18:48.327 --> 00:18:49.862
THE BEST PRACTICE TO ESTABLISH

00:18:49.928 --> 00:18:52.064
REPLACEMENT COSTS OUT WELL IN

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.166
IN YOUR REPORT HERE REFERS TO

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:56.468
US NORMAL ACOSTA WELL THERE'S

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:57.736
NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT WHAT WE

00:18:57.803 --> 00:18:59.538
EXPERIENCE THE MAGNITUDE OF

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:01.273
THE NORTH BAY FIRES AS I REFER

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.242
TO THEM OF THE MAGNITUDE HAS

00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:05.210
THROWN EVERYTHING -- INTO

00:19:05.277 --> 00:19:06.578
FLOCKS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:07.913
DEALING WITH ON THE INSURANCE

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.082
SIDE BUT ALSO ON THE CONTRACTOR

00:19:10.148 --> 00:19:12.684
SIDE WHAT I I MET WITH A BUNCH

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:14.219
CONTRACTORS A NUMBER OF THEM

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:16.188
IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS TO TRY

00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:17.856
AND GIVE US A FLAVOR OF WHAT

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:19.525
THEY'RE EXPERIENCING ONE ASKED

00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:21.059
THIS IS WITH THEM THIS QUESTION

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:23.028
ABOUT ESTABLISHING REPLACEMENT

00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:24.863
COST THEY SAID THE THE THEY

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.665
SAID THE ONUS IS REALLY BACK

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:28.600
ON THE HOMEOWNER THAT THE THE

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:30.068
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY MAY HAVE

00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:32.437
FAILED LOCALLY TO EXPLAIN THE

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.373
PROCESS BUT IT REALLY GETS

00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:36.174
BACK TO THE FIRE VICTIM TO DO

00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:37.943
THEIR HOMEWORK WITH ALL OF THE

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.212
RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND TAKE

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.047
ADVANTAGE OF THEM WHAT OTHER

00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:43.815
CONTRACTORS SAID IS IF YOU HAVE

00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:45.751
A HOME THAT YOU LOST GO FIND

00:19:45.817 --> 00:19:47.619
A HOME THAT'S BEING REBUILT

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:49.888
SOMEONE IN YOUR SIZE IN YOUR

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:51.323
NEIGHBORHOOD AND FIND OUT WHAT

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.158
THOSE BUILDING COSTS ARE FROM

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:54.993
THE CONTRACTORS DOING THE WORK

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.762
IT'S ROUGHLY IN COFFEE PARK

00:19:56.828 --> 00:19:58.297
WHICH LOS THIRTEEN HUNDRED

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:00.566
HOMES CHRIS -- TWO HUNDRED AND

00:20:00.632 --> 00:20:01.934
FORTY TO TWO HUNDRED NINETY

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.569
DOLLARS IS THE REBUILDING PER

00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:05.671
SQUARE FOOT COSTS THAT MOST OF

00:20:05.737 --> 00:20:07.339
THE BUILDERS ARE EXPERIENCING

00:20:07.406 --> 00:20:08.907
UP AND FOUND A GROVE IT RANGES

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:10.609
FROM THREE TWENTY FIVE TO FIVE

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:12.344
HUNDRED ON THE LOW SIDE PER

00:20:12.411 --> 00:20:14.246
SQUARE FOOT AND SIX TO EIGHT

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:16.848
HUNDRED DOLLARS OR MORE ON --

00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:19.284
ON THE HIGH SIDE THE MAJORITY

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:21.353
OF UNDER INSURED SIR TRYING TO

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.789
BUILD A CUSTOM HOME AND THAT

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:25.591
THAT'S PART OF THE DIFFICULTY

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:27.326
IT SO MUCH EASIER DOWN THE

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:30.062
COFFEE PARK WITH FLAT LOTS THEN

00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:32.965
THE THEN THE HILLSIDE LOTS WHAT

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:34.700
I WAS TOLD BY THE BUILDERS IS

00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:36.568
THE HILLSIDE LOTS IN THE COST

00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:38.170
OF BUILDING THAT GOES INTO THAT

00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:39.871
CAN ADD ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY

00:20:39.938 --> 00:20:41.773
TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.076
TO THE COST OF REBUILDING AS

00:20:44.142 --> 00:20:46.311
OPPOSED TO DOWN IN A FLAT LOT

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:47.746
OF PRODUCTION HOMES OR WHAT'S

00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:49.681
GOING ON IN THE COFFEE PARK

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:51.416
AREA WITH THE THIRTEEN HUNDRED

00:20:51.483 --> 00:20:53.318
HOMES VERY FEW PEOPLE AS I

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:54.620
SAID A REBUILDING THE HOME THEY

00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:56.955
LOST IT IS FAR MORE EFFICIENT

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:58.490
EFFECTIVE AND THEY CAN GET A

00:20:58.557 --> 00:21:00.225
GUARANTEED PRICE PER SQUARE

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:02.327
FOOT BY HAVING A BUILDER COME

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:03.595
IN AND SAY I'VE GOT TWELVE

00:21:03.662 --> 00:21:06.098
MODELS YOU PICK ONE WILL HANDLE

00:21:06.164 --> 00:21:07.399
ALL OF CONSTRUCTION IN THE

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:09.635
FINISHING NO CHANGE ORDERS

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:11.003
AND NEXT TIME WE SEE YOU WILL

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:12.170
HAND YOU YOUR KEYS TO THE

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:14.039
HOUSE BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:16.174
WAY A CONTRACTOR A CAN GIVE

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:18.076
A GUARANTEED PRICE IF THEY IF

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:20.078
THEY DON'T HAVE TO GET INTO A

00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:21.313
HOMEOWNER SAYING IN THE MIDDLE

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.981
OF A PROJECT YOU KNOW ON MY

00:21:23.048 --> 00:21:24.349
BROTHER IN LAW BILLS KITCHEN

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:25.851
CABINETS HOW ABOUT HOW ABOUT

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:27.619
IF YOU USE HIM THAT DOESN'T

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:29.287
WORK I I'D ADD THE PRICE

00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:30.555
DIFFERENCES THAT I WAS ASKED

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:32.257
ABOUT IN AREAS AFFECTED BY THE

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:34.660
FIRE -- BOYS I JUST NOTED IT

00:21:34.726 --> 00:21:36.561
SO THE HILLSIDE HOMES IT WILL

00:21:36.628 --> 00:21:38.630
TAKE MUCH LONGER TO REBUILD

00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:40.699
AND HAVE LESS OF A REBUILD IN

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:42.701
-- PERCENTAGE WISE THAN SAY A

00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:44.903
COFFEE PARK OR A LARGE FIELD

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.072
THAT -- PRIMARY DRIVER IS THE

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:48.974
PROPERTY AND -- WHETHER IT'S

00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:51.610
FLAT OR HILL SIDE FINALLY I WAS

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:54.246
ASKED ABOUT THE -- PRICES SO

00:21:54.312 --> 00:21:56.214
TO BUILD IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY

00:21:56.281 --> 00:21:58.684
SEVENTEEN AND THEN IN OCTOBER

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.452
NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:02.554
PRE FIRE AND POST FIRE I WAS

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:04.890
SURPRISED WHEN THE DOZENS OF

00:22:04.956 --> 00:22:06.324
CONTRACTORS THAT I TALKED TO

00:22:06.391 --> 00:22:07.759
SAID THERE'S REALLY NOT THAT

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:09.695
MUCH DIFFERENCE BUT I I MEAN

00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:12.330
BUILDING COSTS THEMSELVES -- ON

00:22:12.397 --> 00:22:14.366
IN SEPTEMBER FIRST TO OCTOBER

00:22:14.433 --> 00:22:15.967
-- THERE REALLY FAIRLY SIMILAR

00:22:16.034 --> 00:22:17.502
IF YOU PRICE THE HOME THE

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:19.204
BIGGEST CONSIDERATION AND THE

00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:21.139
PROBLEM WE'RE FACING IS LABOR

00:22:21.206 --> 00:22:23.141
COSTS YOU CAN AUTOMATICALLY

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:24.476
ADD THEY SAID ANYWHERE FROM

00:22:24.543 --> 00:22:26.745
TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:28.547
OF THE COST OF BUILDING FREE

00:22:28.613 --> 00:22:30.615
FIRE VERSES BUILDING POST

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:32.284
FIRE AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.619
MAGNITUDE OF THE DISASTER HAS

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:36.421
LED TO COMPETITION FOR LABOR

00:22:36.488 --> 00:22:38.423
LIKE WE'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.592
BEFORE AND SO IS THAT'S THE

00:22:40.659 --> 00:22:42.728
THAT MATERIALS A GO UP AND

00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:44.830
DOWN A LITTLE BIT ARCHITECTURAL

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:46.998
CHANGES LEAD TO HIGHER PRICES

00:22:47.065 --> 00:22:48.867
AND I WILL CLOSE BY SAYING

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:51.503
WITH THE THE STATE HAS DONE A

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.338
WONDERFUL JOB OVER THE YEARS

00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:55.874
AND CODE CHANGES FOR SAFETY

00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:58.009
GREEN BUILDING AT CETERA BUT

00:22:58.076 --> 00:22:59.711
IT'S ALSO COME WITH A PRICE TAG

00:22:59.778 --> 00:23:01.246
ONE HOME BUILDER THAT BUILT A

00:23:01.313 --> 00:23:02.848
HOME IN COFFEE PARK IN NINETEEN

00:23:02.914 --> 00:23:05.584
EIGHTY SIX ADDED UP ALL IT TOOK

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.952
THOSE PLANS AND WHAT IT WOULD

00:23:07.018 --> 00:23:08.754
COST TO BRING THOSE PLANS UP

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.189
TO CODE TODAY AND IT ADDED JUST

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:12.958
OVER A HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND

00:23:13.024 --> 00:23:14.760
DOLLARS SO I APPRECIATE THE

00:23:14.826 --> 00:23:16.928
CODE CHANGES AND THE INTENTION

00:23:16.995 --> 00:23:18.630
OF THEM -- BUT IT DOES COME

00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:20.465
WITH A PRICE TAG AND HOMEOWNERS

00:23:20.532 --> 00:23:22.400
GETTING STICKER SHOCK AT WHAT

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:24.002
IT COSTS TO BRING A HOME UP

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:25.570
TO CODE WHICH IS WHY THEY'RE

00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:27.239
CHOOSING NOT TO REBUILD THANK

00:23:27.305 --> 00:23:28.406

COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST

MADE WE'RE REALLY EXPERIENCING

00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:52.864
THIS DISASTER AS A COMMUNITY

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:53.899
IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:23:53.965 --> 00:23:55.534
GET THROUGH IT AS A COMMUNITY

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.068
I KNOW YOU'LL HEAR A LITTLE

00:23:57.135 --> 00:23:59.604
BIT LATER FROM -- UNITED POLICY

00:23:59.671 --> 00:24:01.673
HOLDERS A SURVEY WAS DONE

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.408
TWO THIRDS OF SANTA ROSEN'S

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:04.676
THAT LOST THEIR HOME OR UNDER

00:24:04.743 --> 00:24:06.077
INSURED BY MORE THAN THREE

00:24:06.144 --> 00:24:07.612
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:08.980
IF YOU LOOK IN YOUR PACKET

00:24:09.047 --> 00:24:10.582
OVER HALF OF MY CONSTITUENTS

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:13.084
HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO FIND

00:24:13.151 --> 00:24:14.519
A NUMBER THAT WORKS WITH THEM

00:24:14.586 --> 00:24:15.954
AND WITH THEIR INSURANCE TO

00:24:16.021 --> 00:24:17.088
ACTUALLY START REBUILDING THEIR

00:24:17.155 --> 00:24:18.857
HOME SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:20.492
THE NUMBERS OF WHY WE HAVEN'T

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:22.360
REBUILT MORE IN OUR COMMUNITY

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:23.495
FOR ACTUALLY VERY PROUD THAT WE

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:24.663
HAVE OVER A THOUSAND HOMES AND

00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:26.264
SANTA ROSA UNDER CONSTRUCTION

00:24:26.331 --> 00:24:27.866
ABOUT A THIRD OF WHAT WAS LOST

00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:29.167
THAT'S REALLY FAST WHEN YOU

00:24:29.234 --> 00:24:31.236
CONSIDER HOW EXTENSIVE THE

00:24:31.303 --> 00:24:32.571
DEBRIS CLEANUP WAS AND SOME

00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:33.572
OF THE OTHER CHALLENGES THAT

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:35.240
WE'VE MET BUT WHERE PEOPLE ARE

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:37.542
REALLY HAVING A HARD TIME IS IN

00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:38.743
GETTING THAT NUMBER FROM THEIR

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.178
INSURANCE AND I AM HEARING

00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:41.646
OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM MY

00:24:41.713 --> 00:24:43.281
CONSTITUENTS IN FOUNTAIN GROW

00:24:43.348 --> 00:24:44.449
THAT THEY ARE BEING PRESSURED

00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:45.984
TO SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE ON

00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:47.352
AN AGREEMENT BEFORE THEY'VE

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:48.386
BEEN ABLE TO EVEN FIND A

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:50.121
CONTRACTOR TO GIVE THEM A BIT

00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:52.090
FOR REBUILDING THEIR HOME A LOT

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:54.392
OF THAT IS AROUND THE EIGHTEEN

00:24:54.459 --> 00:24:56.795
MONTH EXT MARK THAT THEY HAVE

00:24:56.862 --> 00:24:58.697
FOR TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE AND

00:24:58.763 --> 00:25:00.432
THAT IS IF I HAD TO CHOOSE ONE

00:25:00.498 --> 00:25:01.566
THING FOR YOU TO TAKE A LOOK

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:03.168
AT IT BE AN EXTENSION OF THAT

00:25:03.235 --> 00:25:04.936
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AS HAS BEEN

00:25:05.003 --> 00:25:07.005
SAID WE ARE IN A NEW NORMAL

00:25:07.072 --> 00:25:09.241
WHERE THE DEVASTATION IS A

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:11.276
LOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THAT

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:13.445
PASSED FIRES WHEN YOU HAVE A

00:25:13.511 --> 00:25:14.746
FIRE LIKE THIS YOU CREATE ITS

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:16.448
OWN ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND THE

00:25:16.514 --> 00:25:17.749
RESPONSE IS NOT GOING TO BE

00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:19.351
THE SAME SO NOT ONLY WAS THE

00:25:19.417 --> 00:25:21.019
DEBRIS CLEANUP LONGER THAN IT

00:25:21.086 --> 00:25:22.587
SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT WE'VE ALSO

00:25:22.654 --> 00:25:24.456
NOTICED DIFFERENT QUIRKS IF

00:25:24.522 --> 00:25:26.057
YOU WILL -- THAT HAVE COME UP

00:25:26.124 --> 00:25:28.693
FROM THIS WE HAD A WATER SYSTEM

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.629
UP IN FOUNTAIN GROVE THAT

00:25:30.695 --> 00:25:33.064
LITERALLY MELTED AND CREATED A

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:36.101
BENZENE ISSUE IN THE SOIL THAT

00:25:36.167 --> 00:25:37.369
PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM BEING

00:25:37.435 --> 00:25:38.837
ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR

00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:40.805
REBUILD UP UNTIL WE CLEARED

00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:42.807
THIS THIS ACTUALLY BEGINNING OF

00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:44.943
THE MONTH SO TOOK US A YEAR TO

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:46.378
CLEAR THE SOIL OF THE BENZENE

00:25:46.444 --> 00:25:47.312
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS SAFE

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:49.014
FOR PEOPLE TO REBUILD SO THOSE

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.315
FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN LIVING IN

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:52.183
TEMPORARY HOUSING ONLY HAVE

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.919
SIX MONTHS LEFT AT THIS POINT

00:25:53.985 --> 00:25:55.720
OF THAT TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE

00:25:55.787 --> 00:25:56.922
BEFORE THEIR EXPECTED TO BE

00:25:56.988 --> 00:25:58.156
BACK IN THEIR HOME THAT'S

00:25:58.223 --> 00:26:00.158
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WE HAD

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:01.726
JOURNEYS AND A MOBILE HOME

00:26:01.793 --> 00:26:04.095
PARK WHERE FORTY FOUR OF THE

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:06.865
UNITS WERE NOT DESTROYED WERE

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:08.366
LARGELY NOT DAMAGED BY THE

00:26:08.433 --> 00:26:10.435
FIRE BUT THE WATER SYSTEM WAS

00:26:10.502 --> 00:26:11.803
DESTROYED IN CONTAMINATED THE

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.405
JOURNEY'S END WHICH MEANS THAT

00:26:13.471 --> 00:26:15.473
THOSE FORTY FOUR HOMES CANNOT

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.841
RE OCCUPY THEIR HOME AND THEY

00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:18.109
ALSO CANNOT BE PAID OUT BY

00:26:18.176 --> 00:26:19.577
THEIR INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY

00:26:19.644 --> 00:26:21.146
HAVEN'T BEEN CONDEMNED THEY'RE

00:26:21.212 --> 00:26:23.181
SITTING IN LIMBO THIS EIGHTEEN

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:25.850
MONTHS REALLY IS NOT ENOUGH IN

00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:27.185
ORDER FOR MY CONSTITUENTS TO

00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:29.287
BEGIN THE RECOVERY PROCESS EVEN

00:26:29.354 --> 00:26:30.522
MOVING AS QUICKLY AS WE'VE BEEN

00:26:30.588 --> 00:26:32.490
MOVING AND I WILL TELL YOU --

00:26:32.557 --> 00:26:34.092
CITY SANTA ROSA A LOT OF OUR

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:35.927
JOB IS BEEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS

00:26:35.994 --> 00:26:37.495
TO HAVE PEOPLE MOVE FORWARD

00:26:37.562 --> 00:26:39.264
ONCE THEY HAVE THEIR PLANS IS

00:26:39.331 --> 00:26:40.799
SUBMITTED TO THE CITY IT TAKES

00:26:40.865 --> 00:26:42.167
FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS TO THE PLAN

00:26:42.233 --> 00:26:45.136
CHECK THE DELAY IS LARGELY NOT

00:26:45.203 --> 00:26:47.839
ON GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY WHICH

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:49.274
I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE PRETTY

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:50.775
SURPRISED TO HEAR IT'S ACTUALLY

00:26:50.842 --> 00:26:52.010
ON THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

00:26:52.077 --> 00:26:53.111
TRYING TO GET THESE ELEMENTS

00:26:53.178 --> 00:26:56.414
DONE -- IN A IN A AS I SAID

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:57.983
IN A LOT OF WAYS THIS EIGHTEEN

00:26:58.049 --> 00:26:59.684
MONTH METRIC IS BEING USED TO

00:26:59.751 --> 00:27:01.252
TRY TO LEVERAGE SETTLEMENTS

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:03.221
FASTER FROM MY CONSTITUENTS

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:04.322
MANY OF WHOM ARE REPORTING

00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:05.090
THAT THEY'RE GETTING LOW

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:06.558
BALLED AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY

00:27:06.624 --> 00:27:09.594
HAVE NO OPTIONS BUT TO SIGN

00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:10.528
ONE THING I WOULD ASK THIS

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:11.963
COMMITTEE TO DO IS TO REVISIT

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.031
SOME OF THE INSURANCE BILLS

00:27:13.098 --> 00:27:13.965
THAT WERE INTRODUCED IN THIS

00:27:14.032 --> 00:27:16.001
COMMITTEE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:27:16.067 --> 00:27:18.069
-- SENATOR DODD ASSEMBLY WOMAN

00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:19.904
AGUIAR-CURRY SENATOR MCGUIRE

00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:21.339
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD THEY ALL

00:27:21.406 --> 00:27:22.607
BROUGHT FORTH REALLY THOUGHTFUL

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:23.875
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD HELP MY

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:26.077
CONSTITUENTS AS I SAID EVERY

00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:27.245
ADDITIONAL DELAY OR EVERY

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:29.014
ADDITIONAL COST MAKES IT MORE

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.915
LIKELY THAT SANTA ROSEN'S DON'T

00:27:30.982 --> 00:27:32.717
REBUILD THEIR HOME ONE BILL IN

00:27:32.784 --> 00:27:34.719
PARTICULAR FROM SENATOR MCGUIRE

00:27:34.786 --> 00:27:36.087
WOULD HAVE ALLOWED PEOPLE TO

00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:38.656
BE PAID OUT FOR THEIR ITEMS IN

00:27:38.723 --> 00:27:39.924
THEIR HOME THAT WERE DESTROYED

00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:40.892
WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH

00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:42.494
THE PROCESS OF ITEMIZING

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.662
EVERY SINGLE ISSUE THAT IS A

00:27:44.729 --> 00:27:47.232
SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT AND

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:48.867
RE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE FOR MY

00:27:48.933 --> 00:27:50.568
CONSTITUENTS AND WHEN WE TALK

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:51.669
ABOUT THE AGGREGATE OF WHAT

00:27:51.736 --> 00:27:52.837
THEY HAVE TO DO GO THROUGH THE

00:27:52.904 --> 00:27:53.805
HOOPS THAT THEY HAVE TO JUMP

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:55.273
THROUGH IN ORDER TO REBUILD

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.641
THAT'S THE ONE THAT I HEAR MORE

00:27:56.708 --> 00:27:58.109
OFTEN THAN NOT WHERE PEOPLE

00:27:58.176 --> 00:27:59.077
WANT TO THROW UP THEIR HANDS

00:27:59.144 --> 00:28:00.111
AND SAY WHAT WAS THE POINT OF

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:02.213
HAVING INSURANCE I'D WE REALLY

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.448
ENCOURAGE YOU TO REVISIT THOSE

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:06.284
BILL THOSE BILLS THE OTHER

00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:07.252
THING THAT ENCOURAGE YOU TO

00:28:07.318 --> 00:28:09.054
DO IS LOOK AT SOME OF THE ODD

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.422
QUIRKS THAT MAKE THEIR WAY

00:28:10.488 --> 00:28:12.957
INTO INSURANCE -- POLICIES

00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:14.392
MANY FOLKS AND FOUND GROWTH HAD

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:15.927
TOLD ME THAT IN THEIR INSURANCE

00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:18.263
PLAN WAS A REQUIREMENT THAT

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:19.497
THEY REBUILD THEIR HOME WITHIN

00:28:19.564 --> 00:28:21.499
TEN PERCENT OF ITS ORIGINAL

00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:23.768
FOOT PRINT AS MR WOOD SAID

00:28:23.835 --> 00:28:24.769
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT SIX

00:28:24.836 --> 00:28:25.970
HUNDRED DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT

00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:27.005
OR EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:28.373
SQUARE FOOT TO REBUILD YOUR

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.008
HOME SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:30.875
IT'S GOING TO PENCIL OUT AS

00:28:30.942 --> 00:28:32.844
IF YOU BUILD SMALLER AND A LOT

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:34.112
OF THESE POLICIES ARE SAYING

00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:35.113
THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO STILL

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.748
BE WITHIN TEN PERCENT ON THE

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:38.450
BOTTOM AND I UNDERSTAND THE

00:28:38.516 --> 00:28:39.484
INTENT IS THAT THEY WON'T GO

00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:41.286
HOG WILD AND BUILD WAY BIGGER

00:28:41.352 --> 00:28:42.620
THAN THEY HAD IT'S ACTUALLY

00:28:42.687 --> 00:28:43.655
PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM BEING

00:28:43.721 --> 00:28:45.123
ABLE TO REBUILD BECAUSE THEY

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:48.226
CAN'T REBUILD SMALLER FINALLY I

00:28:48.293 --> 00:28:50.395
WOULD ASK THIS COMMITTEE REALLY

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:52.564
DO A GOOD JOB OF LOOKING AT

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.365
THIS FROM A HOLISTIC STANDPOINT

00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:56.401
NOT JUST INSURANCE FOR RECOVERY

00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:57.902
BUT LOOKING AT THE FEMA PROCESS

00:28:57.969 --> 00:28:59.471
AS WELL WHAT FEMALE WILL PAY

00:28:59.537 --> 00:29:01.306
FOR VERSES WHAT INSURANCE WILL

00:29:01.372 --> 00:29:05.376
PAY FOR WE ARE FINDING WAYS

00:29:05.443 --> 00:29:06.845
THAT IS CHALLENGING A GIVE

00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:08.746
YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF MANY OF

00:29:08.813 --> 00:29:10.615
YOUR COMMUNITIES I'M SURE MADE

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:12.684
THE MOVE YEARS AGO TO REQUIRE

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.252
SIDEWALK REPAIRS TO BE DONE

00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:16.087
BY HOMEOWNERS IT'S BEEN PRETTY

00:29:16.154 --> 00:29:17.088
STANDARD THROUGHOUT THE STATE

00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:19.324
NOW THE WAY THAT THIS IS PLAYED

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.326
OUT IN IN THAT IN A DISASTER

00:29:21.392 --> 00:29:24.429
IS FOR OUR CITY THOSE SIDEWALKS

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:26.564
ARE NOW BEING REPAIRED USING

00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:28.066
INSURANCE DOLLARS BECAUSE

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:29.601
FEMALE WILL NOT COVER THEM

00:29:29.667 --> 00:29:30.668
BECAUSE FEMA HAS SAID THAT

00:29:30.735 --> 00:29:31.903
THIS ACTUALLY ON THE ONUS OF

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:33.771
THE HOMEOWNER SO PARTICULARLY

00:29:33.838 --> 00:29:35.373
WHEN IT COMES TO DEBRIS REMOVAL

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.275
OR WE HAVE THESE BIG TRACTORS

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:38.910
THAT WERE -- WORKING THEIR WAY

00:29:38.977 --> 00:29:40.245
ON OUR STREETS AND ON OUR SIDE

00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:41.846
WALKS AND DOING DAMAGE THAT IS

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:43.515
NOT COVERED BY FEMA WHEN YOU

00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:45.717
LOOK AT DAMAGED TREES FEMALE

00:29:45.783 --> 00:29:46.985
WILL COVER A TREE IF IT IS

00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:48.686
FOUR INCHES IN DIAMETER SIX

00:29:48.753 --> 00:29:50.622
FEET TALL AND FROM THE GROUND

00:29:50.688 --> 00:29:52.390
UP BUT IT WILL NOT COVER THE

00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:53.424
ROOTS AND IT WILL NOT COVER

00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:54.959
THE STOP THAT WILL FALL ON

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:55.960
INSURANCE FOR THAT WILL FALL

00:29:56.027 --> 00:29:58.496
ON THE CITY THERE ARE I'D SAY

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:01.900
RIDICULOUS EXACT DEFINITIONS

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:03.468
THAT ARE HAVING TO BE MET

00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:05.136
AND IF THE STATE LAWS AND

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:07.305
IF FEMA OPERATING PROCEDURES

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:08.806
ART COINCIDING WITH ONE

00:30:08.873 --> 00:30:10.108
ANOTHER IT LEAVES HOMEOWNERS

00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:12.076
IN LIMBO APPLAUSE THERE AND

00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:19.517

00:30:48.479 --> 00:30:49.948
OUR FIRST PANELIST --

00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:51.349
YOU MENTIONED THAT HIGH

00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:53.084
TURNOVER AND ADJUSTERS WHAT

00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:56.120
IS THE RATIONALE FOR THAT

00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:56.921
WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE

00:30:56.988 --> 00:30:59.257
CAUSES THAT HAVE LED TO THAT

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:01.960
STAFFING THEY THEY WEREN'T

00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:03.695
PREPARED DAY BEING THE

00:31:03.761 --> 00:31:05.563
INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THIS

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.365
IS THEIR BUSINESS MODEL THIS

00:31:07.432 --> 00:31:08.600
IS HOW THEY TRAVEL AROUND THE

00:31:08.666 --> 00:31:10.668
COUNTRY THAT'S HOW THEY STAFF

00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:12.136
THESE STORMS THEY DON'T KEEP

00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:14.505
THESE PEOPLE IN PLACE FOR VERY

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:15.974
LONG BECAUSE NEXT THING YOU

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.108
KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER STORM IN

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:18.076
FLORIDA AND THEY HAVE TO GO

00:31:18.142 --> 00:31:20.211
THERE SO THEY'RE CONSTANTLY

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:22.447
BEING TURNED OVER IT'S HARD

00:31:22.513 --> 00:31:23.781
IT'S FRANKLY IT'S HARD TO

00:31:23.848 --> 00:31:25.083
ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS WITH

00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:27.352
THESE ADJUSTERS BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:31:27.418 --> 00:31:28.920
NOT THERE VERY LONG YOU KNOW

00:31:28.987 --> 00:31:31.122
YOU'VE DEVELOPER REPORTER AND

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:33.558
AND YOU MAY GET THIS CLAIM

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:35.226
SETTLED A LITTLE BIT FASTER

00:31:35.293 --> 00:31:37.061
BUT AS SOON AS ANOTHER STORM

00:31:37.128 --> 00:31:39.764
COMES ALONG THEY'RE GONE SO

00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:41.132
IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE QUITTING

00:31:41.199 --> 00:31:42.533
THE COMPANY PER SE BUT THE

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.769
COMPANY IS CHOOSING TO MOVE

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:47.805
THEM AROUND BASED ON THE ORDER

00:31:47.872 --> 00:31:50.842
OF PRIORITIES AT THE TIME I

00:31:50.908 --> 00:31:51.809
WOULD I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT

00:31:51.876 --> 00:31:53.244
STATEMENT AND WORK FOR THE

00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:55.280
INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT THAT'S

00:31:55.346 --> 00:31:56.414
THAT'S THE ONLY CONCLUSION I

00:31:56.481 --> 00:31:59.284
CAN REACH I MEAN CERTAINLY ANY

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.518
ANY TIME THAT WE'RE DEALING

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:02.253
WITH ANY COMPANY -- BUREAUCRACY

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.455
WHEN THERE'S THERE'S NOT AN

00:32:04.522 --> 00:32:05.790
UNDERSTANDING OF THE OF THE

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:07.959
BASICS AND SOMEBODY GETS

00:32:08.026 --> 00:32:09.627
SHIFTED AND YOU'RE STARTING

00:32:09.694 --> 00:32:10.862
THE WHOLE PROCESS ALL OVER

00:32:10.928 --> 00:32:12.163
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THAT'S GOING

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.799
TO EXTEND THE TIME FRAME AND

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:16.768
IT'S GOING TO EXACERBATE THE

00:32:16.834 --> 00:32:19.370
PROBLEM SO YOU IT SOUNDS LIKE

00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:23.207
IT'S A CHOICE AS WITH REGARD

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:24.475
WHAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY

ADJUST THE CLAIM DIFFERENTLY

00:32:37.922 --> 00:32:40.892

A ONE PERCENT VACANCY RATE

00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:00.978

AUTOMATICALLY IN IN LARGE PART

00:38:07.518 --> 00:38:09.120
BECAUSE THOSE WHO LOST THEIR

RENTERS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.604
THOSE ARE THOSE VULNERABLE

00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:28.105
FOLKS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:29.206
AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS

00:38:29.273 --> 00:38:30.574
WHEN THEY'RE EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF

00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:32.643
ASSISTANCE RUNS OUT THOSE FOLKS

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:33.944

MARGINS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:38:35.413 --> 00:38:37.181
FIND THEIR OWN HOUSING AS WELL

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:38.816
IN A MARKET THAT'S TIGHT IN

00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:41.052
AN AREA THAT'S EXPENSIVE WE'VE

00:38:41.118 --> 00:38:41.952
SEEN THIS THROUGHOUT THE THE

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:45.956
WHOLE COMMUNITY NOT JUST WHAT

00:38:46.023 --> 00:38:46.991
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IF YOU

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:49.560
KNOW I HAVE DECIDED TO RELOCATE

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:51.295
AS OPPOSED TO REBUILD CAM AND

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:52.997
JUST HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO TO

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:54.598
REBUILD SO THAT'S A HARD ONE

00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:56.233

ELSEWHERE I KNOW THAT THERE'S

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:08.846
PROBABLY SOME DATA THAT'S OUT

00:39:08.913 --> 00:39:10.381

BETWEEN A THIRD AND A HALF OF

00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:15.319
FOLKS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES TO

COORDINATION OR UNDERSTANDING

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.848

TALK A LOT ABOUT REBUILDING

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:29.660
BETTER NOT JUST BUILDING BACK

00:40:29.727 --> 00:40:31.162

SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT

00:40:32.696 --> 00:40:33.964
HAVE BEEN FACING ALL OF OUR

00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:35.332

BEGIN WITH AND I'LL GIVE YOU

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.669
AN EXAMPLE OBVIOUSLY HOUSING

HAS BEEN TOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO

00:40:40.037 --> 00:40:41.705
COME BY IN CALIFORNIA EVEN

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:43.841
BEFORE THE FIRES IF THERE WAS

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:46.277
A WAY FOR SACRAMENTO TO ADDRESS

00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:48.312
NOT JUST SPENDING DOLLARS TO

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:49.513
PUT SOMEBODY IN AN APARTMENT

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.348
COMPLEX FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND

00:40:51.415 --> 00:40:52.449
TRY TO MOVE THEM FOR THAT WAY

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:53.684
WHILE THEY REBUILD THEIR HOME

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:55.152
BUT ACTUALLY WE IS A CITY WE

00:40:55.219 --> 00:40:57.054
FLIPPED OUR OUR BUILDING CODES

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:59.356
TO ALLOW EIGHTY USER SECONDARY

00:40:59.423 --> 00:41:00.858
UNITS TO BE BUILT FIRST ON

00:41:00.925 --> 00:41:02.226
A PROPERTY IF SOME OF THE

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:04.061
INVESTMENT WAS FORWARD LOOKING

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:05.729
TO BUILD THOSE SECONDARY

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:07.131
UNITS FOR FOLKS TO LIVE IN

00:41:07.198 --> 00:41:08.165
WHILE THEY'RE REBUILDING THEIR

00:41:08.232 --> 00:41:10.100
HOMES THEN WE COME OUT OF IT

00:41:10.167 --> 00:41:11.268
NOT JUST STRONGER BUT WITH

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:12.870
ADDITIONAL HOUSING STOCK SO

00:41:12.937 --> 00:41:14.538
LOOKING AT WAYS TO REBUILD

00:41:14.605 --> 00:41:17.141
BETTER HELP FOLKS TO HIT THEIR

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:18.409
ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AS WELL

00:41:18.475 --> 00:41:20.010
IN THAT REBUILD PROCESS I

00:41:20.077 --> 00:41:21.045
SHOULD MENTION THERE'S A GOOD

00:41:21.111 --> 00:41:23.314
PARTNERSHIP CITY SANTA ROSA

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.882
COUNTY OF CINEMA IT'S THEM A

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:26.283
CLEAN POWER THAT ACTUALLY PUT

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.018
TOGETHER AN ENERGY PACKAGE TO

00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:29.520
ALLOW PEOPLE TO REBUILD NET

QUITE CLEAR THAT THE FIRES WERE

00:43:14.058 --> 00:43:16.493
VERY VERY DEFICIT DEVASTATING

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.562
-- FOR THE PAST COUPLE YEARS

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:20.531
IN A ROW -- HOWEVER IT'S

00:43:20.597 --> 00:43:22.566
ALSO JUST AS CLEAR THAT THAT

00:43:22.633 --> 00:43:23.968
DEVASTATION DIDN'T END WHEN WE

OF OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING

00:43:30.674 --> 00:43:32.543
RIGHT NOW -- MISTER LARSON YOU

00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:34.445
HAD MENTIONED -- THAT PEOPLE

00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:36.246
WERE UNAWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS

00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:37.581
AND THAT THIS WAS WRITTEN --

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:39.717
NUMBER TWO ISSUE -- WERE THERE

00:43:39.783 --> 00:43:41.652
ANY EFFORTS -- THAT YOU KNOW

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:44.588
OF A BROAD BASED THAT THAT WENT

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:46.323
OUT TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE AND

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:48.225
EDUCATE THEM ON THEIR RIGHTS

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:50.594
FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE WHAT

00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:52.262
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF LITERATURE

00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:54.932
PUT OUT BY THE STATE LOCAL

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:57.835
LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES -- I KNOW

00:43:57.901 --> 00:44:00.571
THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES

00:44:00.637 --> 00:44:02.840
TRAIN THEIR STAFF TO TO GO

00:44:02.906 --> 00:44:05.309
THROUGH THEIR POLICY WITH TO

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:06.543
GO THROUGH THE POLICY WITH

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:09.179
THE INSURED'S -- BUT I THINK

00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:10.381
THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB

00:44:10.447 --> 00:44:13.283
OF THAT OKAY AND THEN ALSO

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.687
-- -- QUITE RIGHT OF FROM

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:18.956

BUY A HOUSE AND FIFTEEN YEARS

00:44:24.294 --> 00:44:25.529
LATER SOMETHING DEVASTATING

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:26.463
HAPPENS AND THEY LOSE THAT

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.032
HOUSE AND OVER THE TIME CODES

00:44:28.098 --> 00:44:29.266
HAVE BEEN UPDATING ARE YOU

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:30.768
AWARE OF ANY EFFORTS THAT ARE

00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:32.970
MADE BY INSURANCE COMPANIES TO

00:44:33.037 --> 00:44:36.373
REACH OUT TO THEIR -- CLIENTS

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.741
ARE TO PROPERTY OWNERS THAT

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:39.276
THE INSURER TO HELP THEM TO

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:41.245
UNDERSTAND THAT A CODE UPDATE

00:44:41.311 --> 00:44:42.646
MAY HAVE CAUSED HIM TO BECOME

00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:44.581
UNDER INSURED INTERESTING

00:44:44.648 --> 00:44:45.883

-- I I I TALKED TO EXISTING

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:54.158
HOMEOWNERS SAY LOOK THE LESSON

00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:56.393
OUT OF -- THE DISASTROUS GO

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.362

00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:06.970
RISK SO EVERYBODY ON LOOK AT

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:08.372
THEIR POLICY NOW UNDERSTAND

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:10.174
THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT THE CODE

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.276
CHANGES ARE BUILT INTO THIS

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:14.545
INTO A REBUILD IN INSURANCE

00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:16.046
POLICIES BUT IT'S SOMETHING

00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:17.915
THAT IF IT'S NOT IN THERE OUGHT

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:19.650
TO BE LOOKED AT BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:45:19.716 --> 00:45:21.952
ARE GETTING STICKER SHOCK IN

00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:23.620
A NUMBER OF WAYS BUT THIS IS

00:45:23.687 --> 00:45:25.389
LEADING THE LIST IS -- YOU

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:26.757
CAN LOOK AT FIFTY TO A HUNDRED

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:28.625
THOUSAND MORE FOR AN AVERAGE

00:45:28.692 --> 00:45:30.127
HOME BEFORE YOU EVEN PUT A

THAT THESE FOR ALL -- THEY

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:37.034
MADE SENSE AND IT'S JUST THE

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:38.769
ACCUMULATION OF THEM OVER THE

00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:41.338
YEARS HAS ADDED A HECK OF A

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:43.440
A BIG COST TO THE BUILDING OR

00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:45.342

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:55.886
COMPENSATED BUT HOWARD HOW

00:45:55.953 --> 00:46:01.058
ARE YOUR SERVICES -- RETAINED

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:02.126

REFERRAL -- WE MARKET --

00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:07.397
SANDERS SO WHEN THERE'S A

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:09.600
CRISIS OR DISASTER YOU MOVE

00:46:09.666 --> 00:46:11.768
INTO THAT AREA AND THEN YOU

00:46:11.835 --> 00:46:12.803
KIND OF LIKE IT THE AREA

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.071
WITH MARKETING MARKETING

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:16.573
YEAH I THANK YOU THANK YOU

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:17.674
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON

00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:21.812
ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:23.113
I JUST WANTED TO JUMP IN AND

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.515
OFFER A COMMENT ABOUT THIS

00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:27.050
WHOLE PROCESS ON ONE OF THE

00:46:27.117 --> 00:46:28.318
DISTINCTIVE THINGS ABOUT

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:31.288
THIS TYPE OF FIRE IS THE LOSS

00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:34.124
OF FOUNDATIONS TO HOMES AND

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:35.492
ANYBODY WHO'S IN A HILLSIDE

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:38.562
LOCATION WITH AN OLDER HOME

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:40.964
LIKELIHOOD OF NEEDING A NEW

00:46:41.031 --> 00:46:43.333
FOUNDATION IS GOING TO BE NEW

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.769
SEISMIC STANDARDS SO THERE'S

00:46:45.836 --> 00:46:47.604
A CROSSOVER OF THE EARTHQUAKE

00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:50.040
RISK WHEN YOU HAVE A HOME ON A

00:46:50.107 --> 00:46:52.309
HILLSIDE LOCATION IN CALIFORNIA

00:46:52.376 --> 00:46:53.577
IS REALLY GOING TO JUMP YOUR

00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:56.513
COSTS ANOTHER FACTOR TO KIND

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.816
OF LOOK AT ON AND THE CONTRAST

00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:01.585
IS IF YOU HAVE A NICER HOME

00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:03.654
FIRE FIRE TRUCKS ROLL UP THEY

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.155
KNOCKED DOWN THE FIRE THE COOL

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:07.457
DOWN THE SITE THIS TYPE OF

00:47:07.524 --> 00:47:10.527
MASS LOSS THE ACTUALLY JUST

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:11.995
COLLAPSE IN UPON THE STRUCTURE

00:47:12.062 --> 00:47:15.032
ITSELF IT CAN JUST STAY HOT

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:17.234
FOR DAY AND A HALF AND AN

00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:18.669
INTENSE HEAT IS WHAT DESTROYS

00:47:18.735 --> 00:47:20.704
THE FOUNDATION SO THAT'S A

00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:21.872
PART OF THIS EXPERIENCE OF

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:24.074
THESE VERY INTENSIVE LOSSES

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:26.710
JUST SCALING THROUGH THE ROOF

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:28.145
-- SOME OF THE SANTA ROSA

00:47:28.212 --> 00:47:30.080
NEIGHBORHOODS WERE NOT HILLSIDE

00:47:30.147 --> 00:47:31.848
NEIGHBORHOODS BUT SOME MORE AND

00:47:31.915 --> 00:47:36.153
THAT SPILLS OVER I THINK FOR

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.755
US AS MEMBERS SITTING HERE I

00:47:38.822 --> 00:47:39.890
JUST WANT TO SAY I'VE SENT TO

00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:41.024
A LOT OF THESE HEARINGS IN MY

00:47:41.091 --> 00:47:43.860
CAREER AND I THINK THE THING

00:47:43.927 --> 00:47:46.663
THAT I WOULD SAY JUST FOR US

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:49.666
AS COLLEAGUES TO FOCUS UPON

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:51.668
CALIFORNIA LAW DOES REGULATE

00:47:51.735 --> 00:47:54.004
CLAIMS PRACTICES THERE'S AN

00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:57.207
UNFAIR PLANS PRACTICES ACT

00:47:57.274 --> 00:48:01.044
AND THIS ISSUE OF CHANGING

00:48:01.111 --> 00:48:03.847
ADJUSTERS I THINK YOU COULD

00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:05.849
FORM AN OPINION RUNS AFOUL

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:08.352
OF THAT ACT BECAUSE THE KEY

00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:10.687
OPERATIVE STANDARDS ONION FOR

00:48:10.754 --> 00:48:12.155
CLAIM PROCESS THAT'S THE LAW

00:48:12.222 --> 00:48:16.727
THAT WE'VE ADOPTED IS KNOWINGLY

00:48:16.793 --> 00:48:18.161
COMMITTING OR PERFORMING WITH

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:21.531
SUCH FREQUENCY AS TO INDICATE

00:48:21.598 --> 00:48:24.568
A GENERAL BUSINESS PRACTICE

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:26.603
ANY OF THE FOLLOWING ON UNFAIR

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:27.938
CLAIMS SETTLEMENT PRANK SO

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:29.206
YOU COULD SORT OF AS YOU

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:30.874
SHOULD ARE YOU LESS OKAY OUR

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:33.043
CARRIERS PERFORMING A CERTAIN

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:35.345
TYPE OF ACTIVE SUCH FREQUENCY

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:36.813
AS INDICATED GENERAL BUSINESS

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.349
PRACTICE SOME OF THE TESTIMONY

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:42.653
KIND OF ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE

00:48:42.719 --> 00:48:45.088
WHAT IS THE KEY RULE FAILING TO

00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:46.623
ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT REASONABLE

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:49.092
STANDARDS FOR THE PROMPT

00:48:49.159 --> 00:48:50.661
INVESTIGATION PROCESSING OF

00:48:50.727 --> 00:48:51.962
CLAIMS ARISE INNER INSURANCE

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:54.331
POLICIES SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH

00:48:54.398 --> 00:48:56.800
THE TURNOVER VÀ GESTURES

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:58.168
THERE IS A QUESTION OF IS

00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:00.771
THAT ACTUALLY A FAIR BUSINESS

00:49:00.837 --> 00:49:04.107
PRACTICE WHEN EACH TIME THE NEW

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:06.276
ADJUSTER THAT NEW CONVERSATION

00:55:57.921 --> 00:55:59.022
OAKLAND BERKELEY FIRE NINETY

00:55:59.089 --> 00:56:01.291
ONE -- SO OUR FIRST EXPERIENCE

IN A -- CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE

00:56:04.127 --> 00:56:05.929
WAS THAT ONE WHICH AT THE

00:56:05.995 --> 00:56:07.263
TIME WAS OF COURSE THE RECORD

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:08.965
BREAKER SINCE THAT TIME

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.033
AND WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:12.168
OTHERS BUT AND THIS IS THE

00:56:12.235 --> 00:56:14.037
OUR ORGANIZATION RUNS THREE

00:56:14.104 --> 00:56:15.405
PROGRAMS THAT ARE RELEVANT

TO YOUR INQUIRE YOU TODAY A

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:18.875

BUYING TIPS AND GUIDANCE AND

00:56:22.946 --> 00:56:25.081
BASED ON WHAT WE LEARNED IN

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:26.549
THE ROADMAP TO RECOVERY WHERE

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:27.817
WE GO IN AFTER THERE'S BEEN

00:56:27.884 --> 00:56:30.854
A DISASTER AND WE OFFER OF A

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:33.423
SERIES OF EDUCATIONAL EVENTS

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:34.991
IN PARTNERSHIP GENERALLY WITH

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:37.060
THE LOCAL PUBLIC OFFICIALS --

00:56:37.127 --> 00:56:39.028
AND WE WE GIVE PEOPLE GUIDANCE

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:40.764
ON HOW TO COLLECT THE BENEFITS

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:42.766
OF WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE -- AND

00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:44.434
THEN A LOT OF SUGGESTIONS FOR

00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:45.802
TROUBLE SHOOTING IN OVERCOMING

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:48.204
OBSTACLES AND WE TAKE THE

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:49.205
LESSONS WE LEARNED THERE ARE

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:50.573
WE FEED THAT INTO THE ROAD

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.575
MAP TO PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:54.511
AND TO AGAIN TO TRY TO TEACH

00:56:54.577 --> 00:56:56.212
PEOPLE HOW TO AVOID SOME OF

00:56:56.279 --> 00:56:57.514
THE PROBLEMS THAT DISASTER

00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.048
SURVIVORS HAVE HAD WITH NOT

00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:00.316
HAVING ENOUGH INSURANCE NOT

00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:01.484
HAVING RECORDS ALL THAT SORT

00:57:01.551 --> 00:57:03.052
OF THING SO THEN THE THIRD

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:04.254
PROGRAM IS THE ADVOCACY

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.588
INACTION AND THAT'S WHERE WE

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:07.690
WORK WITH -- ELECTED OFFICIALS

00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:09.125
LIKE YOURSELVES TO TRY TO COME

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:11.661
UP WITH STRATEGIC WAYS EITHER

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:13.863
THROUGH LEGISLATION OR OTHER

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.865
MEANS OF OF TRYING TO SOLVE

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:17.033
THESE PROBLEMS BUT I'M HERE

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:20.470
TO TO TO SAY SADLY -- THAT YOU

00:57:20.537 --> 00:57:22.338
KNOW WE REALLY HAVEN'T MADE

00:57:22.405 --> 00:57:25.041
A WHOLE LOT OF PROGRESS AND

00:57:25.108 --> 00:57:26.976
A IN ON SOME LEVELS AND IT'S

00:57:27.043 --> 00:57:28.578
NOT BECAUSE THERE AREN'T LAWS

00:57:28.645 --> 00:57:30.180
THERE ARE GOOD STRONG LAWS

00:57:30.246 --> 00:57:32.182
IS AND AS KEN COOLEY POINTED

00:57:32.248 --> 00:57:33.983
OUT WE DO HAVE UNFAIR CLAIMS

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:35.285
PRACTICES IN THE CODE WE'VE

00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:37.086
GOT THE FARE CLAIMS HANDLING

00:57:37.153 --> 00:57:38.855
REGULATIONS WE'VE GOT THE AND

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:41.758
INDUSTRY STANDARDS -- AND AND

00:57:41.825 --> 00:57:44.227
SO IT'S IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:45.495
AN ISSUE OF NEEDING TO PASS

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:47.263
MORE LAWS IT MORE ON WE'VE GOT

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:48.965
TO ENFORCE THE ONES WE'VE GOT

00:57:49.032 --> 00:57:50.233
AND I THINK WE'VE REALLY GOT

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.535
TO HAVE A LOT MORE COOPERATION

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:54.103
FROM THE INDUSTRY FOR FOR THEIR

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:57.173
OWN FOR THEIR OWN GOOD AND SO I

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.408
I JUST WANT TO REVIEW A COUPLE

00:57:58.474 --> 00:58:01.811
OF QUICK ISSUES THE THE UNDER

00:58:01.878 --> 00:58:03.580
INSURANCE PROBLEM THE GAPS

00:58:03.646 --> 00:58:04.881
THE ADJUSTING ISSUES YOU'VE

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:05.982
ALREADY BEEN TALKING ABOUT

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:08.017
THEM WITH THE PRIOR PANEL --

00:58:08.084 --> 00:58:09.452
WHAT LAWS WE ALREADY HAVE ON

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:11.454

THE MARKET PLACE -- I THINK

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.995
ULTIMATELY -- I WOULD IMAGINE

MATERIALS OUR ORGANIZATION

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:28.865
-- STARTING FROM WEEK ONE

00:59:28.932 --> 00:59:29.966
BEFORE THE FIRES WERE FULLY

00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:31.968

ASSISTANCE CENTER WHICH ONCE

00:59:38.908 --> 00:59:40.209
IT BECAME FEDERAL IT BECAME

00:59:40.276 --> 00:59:42.845
A DRC SO MY ORGANIZATION WAS

00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:44.781
THERE WE HAD VOLUNTEERS WHO

00:59:44.847 --> 00:59:47.383
CAME IN FROM WILD ARE AREAS TO

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:49.919
GIVE PEOPLE -- JUST A A LITTLE

00:59:49.986 --> 00:59:51.187
BIT OF A SHOULDER TO CRY ON

00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:52.588

ROTATING ADJUSTERS HAS BEEN

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:05.501
A CHRONIC PROBLEM LEGISLATURE

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:07.236
ALREADY TOOK A CRACK AT IT

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:09.305
WITH REQUIRING THAT IF THE

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:11.140
COMPANY CHANGES ADJUSTERS MORE

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:12.742
THAN I THINK IT'S LIKE MORE

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:14.877
THAN THREE -- IN A SIX MONTH

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:16.946
PERIOD YOU HAVE TO GET A STATUS

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:18.781

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:20.450
AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT

01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:22.051
THAT THAT YOU GUYS DID BUT I

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:23.653
DON'T REALLY THINK IT'S GETTING

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.621
CARRIED OUT IN REAL LIFE AND

01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:28.358

OF THEIR POLICY WITHIN THIRTY

01:00:33.496 --> 01:00:35.164
DAYS AND THAT'S IT SOUNDS

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:36.666
BASIC BUT AGAIN THESE THINGS

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:37.867
ARE NOT HAPPENING THE WAY

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:39.702
THEY SHOULD THE POLICY HOLDER

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:41.437
THERE'S JUST A MASS AMOUNT OF

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:43.639
MISINFORMATION CONFUSION OUT

01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:46.075
THERE AND I KNOW WE CAN IMPROVE

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:47.944
THAT BY CONTINUING TO DO MORE

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:49.445
COLLABORATION DEPARTMENT OF

01:15:30.392 --> 01:15:31.393
INCREASE IT WOULDN'T INCREASE

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:33.262
IT YOU KNOW WE JUST INSTANCE

01:15:33.328 --> 01:15:34.730
INCREASED IT TO TO THE QUESTION

01:15:34.796 --> 01:15:36.164
SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A FOOT NOW

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:38.200
BECAUSE HE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS SO

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:40.302
SO IT'S THAT KIND OF IT'S NOT

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:41.904
GONNA HAPPEN TO ME THING AND

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.439
-- BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT THE

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:45.707
OF THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENED AND

01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:46.575
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HAVING TO

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:48.143
DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW SO I THINK

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:50.212
COMMUNICATION WITH THE AGENTS

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:51.446
IN THE POLICY HOLDERS TRYING

01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:53.615
TO EXPLAIN TO HIM -- WHEN

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:56.251
EVERYTHING YOU OWN IS GONE --

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:57.853
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE TO GO BACK

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.055
-- TO TO SOME SORT OF NORMALCY

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:01.623
THANK YOU MISTER THERE ARE

01:16:01.690 --> 01:16:02.858
MISTER JACKSON YOU'RE UP NEXT

I UNDERSTAND YOU FIVE AT THE

01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:05.961
RAND CENTER FOR CATASTROPHIC

01:16:06.028 --> 01:16:07.462
RISK MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION

01:16:07.529 --> 01:16:10.098
YOU FINISHED A STUDY ON CLIMATE

01:16:10.165 --> 01:16:11.867
CHANGE AND THEIR IMPACT AND WE

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.135
LOOK FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THIS

01:16:13.201 --> 01:16:14.403
MORNING -- GOOD MORNING AND

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:15.737
IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS

01:16:15.804 --> 01:16:17.572
MORNING YET TODAY ALL OUT GIVE

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:20.075
SOME -- -- SOME OF THE FINDINGS

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:21.510
AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:23.045
WE DID US PART OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:24.780
FOR CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT

01:16:24.846 --> 01:16:25.847
AND IT WAS FUNDED BY THE

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:27.349
CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.818
AGENCY AGENCY SO IN THIS STUDY

01:16:29.885 --> 01:16:31.486
WOULD WE DO WE COMPARED THE

01:16:31.553 --> 01:16:32.888
INSURANCE MARKET OUTCOMES

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:34.156
DIFFERENT MEASURES OF HOW THE

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:36.224
INSURANCE MARKETS PERFORMING IN

01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:37.893
ZIP CODES WITH A HIGH WILD FIRE

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.295
RISK WITH IN -- WITH WITHOUT

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:41.663
COMES AND ZIP CODES WITH --

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:44.099
LOW -- WILD FIRE RISK AND SO

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:45.534
WHAT WE FIND AND I I CAN'T GO

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.501
THROUGH ALL THE FINDINGS BUT

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:47.936
I'LL TALK ABOUT THE A FEW MOST

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:49.404
RELEVANT TO THE -- THE HEARING

01:16:49.471 --> 01:16:51.206
TODAY OUR FIRST REGARDING

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:52.541
THE THE COST TO THE PART OF

01:16:52.607 --> 01:16:53.842
THE PREMIUMS FOR HOMEOWNERS

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:55.844
POLICIES WE LOOKED AT THE --

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:57.446
RATE PER THOUSAND DOLLARS OF

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:59.548
COVERAGE AND WE FOUND THAT IT

01:16:59.614 --> 01:17:01.583
WAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IN THE

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:02.985
END THE CODES WITH HIGH RISK

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:04.519
-- HIGH WILD FIRE RISK AND YOU

01:17:04.586 --> 01:17:06.722
KNOW YOU'D EXPECT THAT -- WE

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:08.724
ALSO FOUND THAT THOSE RATES

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:09.958
FOR THOUSAND DOLLARS COVERS

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:11.393
BEEN INCREASING A LOT FASTER

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.761
IN THE HIGH RISK ZIP CODES

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:15.097
OF ALASKA -- -- SEVENTY SINCE

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:17.232
NINETEEN FIFTY THOUSAND SEVEN

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:18.567
SO WHAT WE FOUND WITH THAT

01:17:18.633 --> 01:17:20.135
-- THE RATES FOR A THOUSAND

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:21.903
DOLLARS OF COVERAGE WERE FIFTY

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:23.238
PERCENT HIGHER IN THE HIGH

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.173
RISK THE ZIP CODES AND THAT

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.608
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:28.443
AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THEY

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:30.846
ROSE TWELVE PERCENT -- COMPARED

01:17:30.912 --> 01:17:32.047
TO LOW RISK OF CODES WERE THE

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:33.148
ACTUALLY THE RATES FOR THOUSAND

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:34.583
DOLLARS COVERAGE COVERAGE FELT

01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:36.918
FELT -- -- TWELVE PERCENT SO

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:38.487
YOU SEE -- YOU KNOW THE MARKET

01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:40.922
ADJUSTING AND -- AND -- HIGHER

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:42.224
AS YOU'D EXPECT HIGHER RATES

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:43.959
IN HIGH RISK OF CODES NOW WHEN

01:17:44.026 --> 01:17:45.660
WE TALK TO THE -- YOU KNOW TALK

01:17:45.727 --> 01:17:46.762
TO THE INSURERS ABOUT THESE

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:48.997
FINDINGS -- YOU KNOW THEY THEY

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:50.599
BY A LARGE BELIEVE THAT THE

01:17:50.665 --> 01:17:52.200
-- THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:54.202
HIGH RISK AND LOW RISK AREAS

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:56.438
DO NOT FULLY REFLECT THE ACTUAL

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:57.873
RISK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:17:57.939 --> 01:17:59.207
HIGH RISK AND LOW RISK AREAS

01:17:59.274 --> 01:18:01.343
THAT -- THAT -- THAT THERE'S

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:03.045
SOME ABOUT COMPRESSION OF THE

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:04.546
OF THE THE RATE DIFFERENCES

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:05.914
ACROSS HIGH RISK AND LOW RISK

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:07.849
AREAS -- WE ALSO TALKED TO THE

01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:09.184
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT INSURANCE

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:11.153
ABOUT THIS AND THEIR FEELING

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:12.954
WAS THAT THEY POINTED OUT FIRST

01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:14.256
THAT THE RATES ARE INCREASING

01:18:14.322 --> 01:18:15.557
A LOT FASTER IN THE IN THE HIGH

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:17.492
RISK AREAS IN THAT THE INSURERS

01:18:17.559 --> 01:18:18.827
REALLY NOT HAVE NOT PROVIDED

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:20.996
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT -- --

01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:22.497
GREATER RESTORE PRINCE OF RATE

01:18:22.564 --> 01:18:24.132
DIFFERENCES ARE WARRANTED --

01:18:24.199 --> 01:18:27.569
BETWEEN THE TWO THE TWO AREAS

01:18:27.636 --> 01:18:29.004
THE SECOND AREA -- WANTED TO

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:30.338
TALK ABOUT TODAY WAS WHAT WE

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:31.873
FOUND OUT OF -- REGARDING THE

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:34.109
ADEQUACY OF COVERAGE AND TO

01:18:34.176 --> 01:18:35.644
LOOK AT THAT WE COMPARED THE

01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:38.346
AMOUNT OF COVERAGE -- USING

01:18:38.413 --> 01:18:40.415
-- -- DATA REPORTED TO THE

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:41.683
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE FIGHT

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:44.152
BY INSURERS -- RELATIVE TO

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:45.654
THE VALUE OF THE STRUCTURES

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.155
-- BY ZIP CODE SO IT'S KIND OF

01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:49.524
A RATIO OF COVERAGE TO -- TO

01:18:49.591 --> 01:18:51.560
INSURABLE OR REPLACEMENT COST

01:18:51.626 --> 01:18:53.728
OF THE OF THE STRUCTURE AND WE

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:55.764
FOUND IT IN THE LOW RISK LOW

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:57.732
ROB FOLLOWED WITH BLOW WILD

01:18:57.799 --> 01:18:59.901
FIRE RISK AREAS THAT THAT RATIO

01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:01.436
IS ROUGHLY HUNDRED PERCENT

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:03.405
-- SO THAT THE THE COVERAGE

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:04.673
AMOUNTS WERE COMPARABLE TO THE

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:06.775
REPLACEMENT AND -- MOUNTAIN THE

01:19:06.842 --> 01:19:08.977
LOWER OF WILD FIRE RISK AREAS

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:10.045
AND THAT IN POINTED OUT THAT

01:19:10.112 --> 01:19:11.813
DOESN'T INCLUDE EXTENDED -- THE

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.182
-- THE EXTENDED COVERAGE THAT'S

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:15.784
JUST THE YOU KNOW THE BASIC

01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:17.452
COVERAGE JAY AND COVERAGE BE

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:19.721
ON THE POLICY -- SO WHILE IT'S

01:19:19.788 --> 01:19:20.789
AROUND A HUNDRED PERCENT --

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:21.990
THAT REACHES RUN HOW TO PRESENT

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:23.458
A LOW RISK AREAS IT IS LOWER

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:25.260
IN THE HIGH RISK AREAS WE FOUND

01:19:25.327 --> 01:19:26.428
IT WAS ABOUT TEN PERCENTAGE

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:28.163
POINT LOWER IN THE -- IN THE

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:32.667
HIGH RISK AREAS -- SO SO SO

01:19:32.734 --> 01:19:34.736
THAT GIVES YOU SOME INDICATION

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:36.304
THAT -- AND COME BACK TO THIS

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:38.273
IN A MINUTE BUT -- THAT --

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.008
HOMEOWNERS IN HIGH RISK AREAS

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:42.110
TEND TO -- BY A LESS COVERAGE

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:43.845
RELATIVE TO THE VALUE OF OF

01:19:43.912 --> 01:19:46.715
THE HOME -- TO PROVIDE ANOTHER

01:19:46.781 --> 01:19:48.750
PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE OF OF

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:50.952
-- OF -- COVERAGE OUT OF THREE

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:53.121
-- ADEQUACY WE ALSO COLLECTED

01:19:53.188 --> 01:19:54.756
DATA ON A CONFIDENTIAL BASIS

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.591
FROM A NUMBER OF INSURERS ON

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:58.260
THE NUMBER OR PERCENTAGE OF

01:19:58.326 --> 01:19:59.761
RESIDENTIAL LOT PART CLAIMS

01:19:59.828 --> 01:20:01.263
THAT UPDATED THE POLICY

01:20:01.329 --> 01:20:02.764
LIMIT YOU KNOW THAT'S ANOTHER

01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:03.899
INDICATION OF YOU KNOW HOW

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:05.167
OFTEN PEOPLE ARE BUMPING UP

01:20:05.233 --> 01:20:06.735
AGAINST THEIR -- COVERAGE

01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:07.936
LIMITS AND HAVING COVERAGE

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:09.905
PROBLEMS AND WE FOUND THAT --

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:10.939
THE INSURERS REPORTED ABOUT

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:12.507
SIX PERCENT OF CLAIMS PAID

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:14.176
AT THE POLICY LIMIT NO THAT'S

01:20:14.242 --> 01:20:15.210
NOT A HIGH PERCENTAGE BUT

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:17.012
YOU KNOW A LOT OF -- A CLAIMS

01:20:17.078 --> 01:20:18.446
ARE SMALL CLAIMS AND YOU

01:20:18.513 --> 01:20:19.581
KNOW THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:21.516
GONNA PLAY POLICY LIMIT SO WE

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:22.584
ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE THE DATA

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:24.152
TO LOOK AT -- WHAT PERCENT OF

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:25.520
THE TOTAL LOSSES PAID AT THE

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:27.222
POLICY LIMITS BUT IT'S PROBABLY

01:20:27.289 --> 01:20:30.625
UP SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER --

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:32.761
OKAY SO WE TALKED ABOUT -- --

01:20:32.827 --> 01:20:33.962
HEARD ALREADY ON THE PANEL A

01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:36.231
NUMBER OF REASONS THAT -- THAT

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:40.101
-- THAT -- -- THAT THESE YOU

01:20:40.168 --> 01:20:41.136
KNOW COVERAGE RATIOS MAY BE

01:20:41.203 --> 01:20:42.571
LOW IN THE HIGH RISK AREAS ONE

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:43.572
OF WHICH THAT YOU KNOW IT'S

01:20:43.638 --> 01:20:45.874
A IT'S A HOMEOWNER CHOICE TO

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:47.142
SOME EXTENT AND THERE ARE YOU

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:48.577
KNOW VERY PRICE SENSITIVE AND

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:51.613
TEND TO -- WANT TO -- CONTROL

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.914
OF OF THE COST OF COVERAGE

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:54.282
AND IF ANY SAID THERE'S A LOT

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:56.751
OF -- INFORMATION UNCERTAINTY

01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:58.353
AND LACK OF INFORMATION ON ON

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:01.856
THIS WHOLE PROCESS OKAY SO --

01:21:01.923 --> 01:21:03.024
THAT'S WE COME IN THE COVERAGE

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:04.593
TO VALUE RATIO WE ALSO FOUND IN

01:21:04.659 --> 01:21:05.961
THE HIGH RISK AREAS THAT PEOPLE

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.262
TEND TO BUY HIGHS HAVE HIGHER

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:09.631
DEDUCTIBLES WE DIDN'T FIND

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:10.799
THAT THAT WAS A HUGE OF FACT

01:21:10.865 --> 01:21:13.301
BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A -- --

01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:14.436
TEND TO BE HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES

01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:16.738
IN HIGH RISK AREAS SO -- LET

01:21:16.805 --> 01:21:18.139
ME CONCLUDE BUT JUST OF MAKING

01:21:18.206 --> 01:21:19.908
A FEW OBSERVATIONS ABOUT OUR

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:22.077
OUR FINDINGS -- FIRST -- YOU

01:21:22.143 --> 01:21:23.311
KNOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IT

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:24.546
HOMEOWNER INSURANCE PREMIUMS IN

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:26.781
CALIFORNIA REFLECT THE ACTUAL

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:28.683
RISK -- IN THE PROPERTY OWNERS

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:30.585
IN HIGH RISK AREAS ARE NOT

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:32.287
CROSS SUBSIDIZED BY PROPERTY

01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:34.589
OWNERS AND LOW RISK AREAS AND

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:36.057
THERE'S A COUPLE OF -- REASONS

01:21:36.124 --> 01:21:38.360
FOR THIS -- THE THE -- CALL

01:21:38.426 --> 01:21:40.595
THESE RISK BASE RATES AND --

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:41.796
YOU KNOW THE ADVANTAGE OF THESE

01:21:41.863 --> 01:21:43.231
RISK BASE RATES IS FIRST THAT

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:44.866
THE CREATE INCENTIVES -- TO

01:21:44.933 --> 01:21:46.501
AVOID BUILDING AND THE RISK IF

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:49.070
AREAS SECOND THEY CAN ENCOURAGE

01:21:49.137 --> 01:21:51.439
MITIGATION BY ALLOWING PREMIUM

01:21:51.506 --> 01:21:52.841
REDUCTIONS ARE DEDUCTIONS FOR

01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:54.843
RISK MITIGATION MEASURES AND

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:56.077
THIRD YOU KNOW YOU COULD ARGUE

01:21:56.144 --> 01:21:57.445
THAT THOSE CROSS SUBSIDIES

01:21:57.512 --> 01:21:58.747
BETWEEN THE LOW RISK AREAS

01:21:58.813 --> 01:22:00.315
IN HIGH RISK AREAS THE STATE

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:01.316
REALLY AREN'T FAIR THE LOW

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:02.684
RISK AREAS YOU KNOW WHY SHOULD

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:04.085
PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW FROM POOR

01:22:04.152 --> 01:22:06.655
URBAN AREAS -- THE IN EFFECT --

01:22:06.721 --> 01:22:08.423
CROSS SUBSIDIZING THE PREMIUMS

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:11.826
IN HIGH RISK AREAS AND THESE

01:22:11.893 --> 01:22:14.229
THESE -- NOW THE IF YOU MOVE

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:15.463
IF YOU GO TO RISK BASE RATES

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:16.264
THERE ARE YOU KNOW GOING TO

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:18.166
BE EXPENSIVE OR THAT THEY ARE

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:19.868
EXPENSIVE AND AND OUR WORKERS

01:22:19.934 --> 01:22:21.736
FOUND THAT WITH CLIMATE CHANGE

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:23.271
YOU COULD WE WE SHOULD ONLY

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:24.873
EXPECT THAT -- THROUGH THESE

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:27.309
RATES TO INCREASE -- AS --

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:29.110
IS WILD PAR RISK -- INCREASES

01:22:29.177 --> 01:22:31.446
TO THE TO THE CLIMATE CHANGE

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:33.448
SO THESE -- THESE -- HIGHER

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:34.683
RATES IN THE HIGH RISK AREAS

01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:35.850
WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CREATE SOME

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:37.385
AFFORDABILITY PROBLEMS FOR

01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:39.354
CERTAIN CERTAIN HOUSEHOLDS BUT

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:40.455
I THINK GOT YOU KNOW MY POINT

01:22:40.522 --> 01:22:42.490
IS AND IT'S JUST A THOUGHT FOR

01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:43.525
YOU KNOW HOW TO PROCEED MOVING

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:45.360
FORWARD THAT RATHER THAN YOU

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:46.361
KNOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING AS

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:47.829
A YOU KNOW THE STATE THAT THE

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:49.164
RATHER THAN PROVIDING CROSS

01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:51.166
SUBSIDIES TO YOU KNOW TO REDUCE

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:52.667
RATES FOR ALL HOMEOWNERS IN

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:53.768
THE HIGH RISK AREAS THAT WE

01:22:53.835 --> 01:22:55.503
TARGET THOSE SUBSIDIES TO

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:56.771
THE HOUSEHOLDS THE MOST NEED

01:22:56.838 --> 01:22:58.707
THEM SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE

01:22:58.773 --> 01:23:00.041
-- NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE

01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:01.376

01:23:01.443 --> 01:23:02.577
HAS ASKED THE NATIONAL FLOOD

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:03.978
INSURANCE PROGRAM TO DEVELOP

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:09.984
ASSISTANCE TO HOUSEHOLDS LOW

01:23:10.051 --> 01:23:11.820
INCOME LOW NETWORK HOUSEHOLDS

01:23:11.886 --> 01:23:13.221
IN YOU KNOW HIGH FLOOD RISK

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:14.923
AREAS AND I THINK THAT'S YOU

01:23:14.989 --> 01:23:16.291
KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING TO THINK

01:23:16.358 --> 01:23:17.625
ABOUT YOU KNOW THOSE KIND OF

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:18.827
WORRY ABOUT FUNDING SOURCE FOR

01:23:18.893 --> 01:23:19.861
THAT AND WHO'S GOING TO PAY

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:21.896
FOR THAT BUT -- YOU KNOW I I

01:23:21.963 --> 01:23:23.031
THINK WE'D BE BETTER OFF WITH

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:24.566
THE STATE WITH RISK BASE RATES

01:23:24.632 --> 01:23:26.167
WITH TARGETED SUBSIDIES TO THE

OPPOSED TO -- CROSS SUBSIDIES

01:23:29.704 --> 01:23:30.972
THAT MAKE RATES CHEAPER FOR

-- IN HIGH RISK AREAS CREE

01:23:44.419 --> 01:23:45.787
OBVIOUS INCENTIVES FOR POLICY

OF COVERAGE THAT THEY BY AND

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:50.291
I THINK WE'VE HEARD SOME OF

THE WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THE

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:53.461
REASONS THAT -- THAT LEAD UP

THE INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR

01:35:40.868 --> 01:35:43.971

PAST OR FUTURE -- THERE WAS

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:02.957
NO OFFER EVEN CLOSE TO THAT

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:04.658
EVEN WHEN IT WAS A WILD

01:36:04.725 --> 01:36:07.862
FIRE -- NATURAL DISASTER

01:36:07.928 --> 01:36:11.265
GOVERNOR DECLARED DISASTER

01:36:11.332 --> 01:36:13.601

LEGISLATION WHICH I WON'T GO

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:17.771
INTO BUT IT SEEMS TO BE AN

01:36:17.838 --> 01:36:19.140
INSURANCE COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:36:19.206 --> 01:36:20.241
-- THEY'RE HERE THIS IS

01:36:20.307 --> 01:36:21.809
NOT THAT WELL I GUESS AND

01:36:21.876 --> 01:36:25.079
IT'S JUST AN OBSERVATION

01:36:25.146 --> 01:36:26.580
USED WE SIT THERE ON THE DIET

01:36:26.647 --> 01:36:27.915
SAYS COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN THE

01:36:27.982 --> 01:36:29.183
INSURANCE INDUSTRY COMES OUT

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:33.220
AND SAYS OVER IF YOU DO THIS

01:36:33.287 --> 01:36:35.022

CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO GO OUT

01:36:40.161 --> 01:36:42.029
OKAY NOBODY WANTS THAT I THINK

01:36:42.096 --> 01:36:43.330
THAT'S -- THAT'S A CONDITION

01:36:43.397 --> 01:36:44.798
THAT -- WERE ALL CONCERNED

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:48.536

01:36:58.145 --> 01:36:59.146
-- WILL THE RATES GO UP FOR

01:36:59.213 --> 01:37:00.714
EVERYBODY BUT WE JUST MIGHT

01:37:00.781 --> 01:37:01.782
MOVE OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:03.450
MARKET AND WE'RE JUST NOT

01:37:03.517 --> 01:37:04.985
COULD ENSURE THEIR OR WILL

01:37:05.052 --> 01:37:06.120
PULL OUT OF THE WILDLAND

01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:07.755

TO THE TO THE TO THE PANEL

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:13.360
HOW DO WE AS LEGISLATORS

01:37:13.427 --> 01:37:15.162
OR HOW DO COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:16.664
PARTICULARLY WHEN WE HAVE THE

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:21.602
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE OPINING

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:22.970
I WANT TO USE BE -- SO I CAN

01:37:23.037 --> 01:37:24.538
I THE I GUESS I CAN DO THAT

01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:26.073
THE TO I DON'T THINK THEY USE

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:28.309
THOSE WORDS BUT IN IN ESSENCE

01:37:28.375 --> 01:37:31.045
THERE SAY NO THAT'S NOT CORRECT

01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:32.680
YOU LOOK AT THE NUMERATOR

01:37:32.746 --> 01:37:35.382
IS LIKE FIVE THOUSAND THE

01:37:35.449 --> 01:37:36.984
DENOMINATORS TWELVE MILLION

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:38.919
POLICY HOLDERS THAT IS NOT

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:42.890
CORRECT AND THEN WE HAVE YOUR

01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:44.291
OTHERS THAT COME IN A WAY IT

01:37:44.358 --> 01:37:47.962
ON BOTH SIDES THEN THE -- I I

01:37:48.028 --> 01:37:49.163
GUESS WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:50.364
SOME DIRECTION FOR COMMITTEE

01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:51.465
MEMBERS THAT SERVE ON THE

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:53.067
INSURANCE COMMITTEE WHAT ARE

01:37:53.133 --> 01:37:55.970
OTHER FACTORS TO MITIGATE THESE

01:37:56.036 --> 01:37:57.571
TYPE OF THINGS TO GET IMPORTANT

01:37:57.638 --> 01:37:59.607
LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION THROUGH

01:37:59.673 --> 01:38:02.009
TO HELP OUR CONSTITUENTS THIS

01:38:02.076 --> 01:38:03.244
IS ALL WE ARE TRYING TO DO FOR

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:05.379
THE VERY VERY BEGINNING A HAD

01:38:05.446 --> 01:38:07.815
-- -- TO TO TO ME WAS VERY VERY

01:38:07.881 --> 01:38:09.650
DISAPPOINTING BUT I CERTAINLY

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:11.185
RESPECT MY COLLEAGUES AT SERVE

01:38:11.252 --> 01:38:12.720
ON THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE

01:38:12.786 --> 01:38:15.356
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT AN OUTCOME

01:38:15.422 --> 01:38:17.424
IT'S ACCEPTABLE FOR FORTY

01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:19.193
MILLION CALIFORNIANS OR TWELVE

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.595
MILLION POLICY HOLDERS SO I'D

01:38:21.662 --> 01:38:23.697
LIKE TO -- DIRECTION -- FROM

01:38:23.764 --> 01:38:27.468
THE OTHER ELEMENT PANELS THIS

01:38:27.534 --> 01:38:28.702
BLOCK YOU WANNA BEGIN THANK

01:38:28.769 --> 01:38:32.606
YOU YES -- -- SO THIS DOES KIND

01:38:32.673 --> 01:38:35.276
OF DRAW DOWN THERE'S JUSTICES

01:38:35.342 --> 01:38:38.178
FINITE NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:41.081
VOLUNTARY AND ENHANCEMENTS OF

01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:43.584
FROM REX'S CLIENTS FROM FROM

01:38:43.651 --> 01:38:45.452
THE CARES MAKE A HUGE AMOUNT

01:38:45.519 --> 01:38:46.620
OF DIFFERENCE AND I HAVE THE

01:38:46.687 --> 01:38:48.255
SAME FRUSTRATION THAT YOU HAVE

01:38:48.322 --> 01:38:50.624
IN TERMS OF WELL YOU KNOW THE

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:52.559
THAT THIS WE HEARD OKAY SIX

01:38:52.626 --> 01:38:54.161
PERCENT OF CLAIMS PAID A POLICY

01:38:54.228 --> 01:38:56.230
LIMIT WE HAVE A VERY SMALL

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:59.166
SUBSET OKAY OF OF THE OF THE

01:38:59.233 --> 01:39:01.268
INSURERS CLIENTS THAT WE ARE

01:39:01.335 --> 01:39:02.936
TRYING TO HELP RIGHT THERE'S A

01:39:03.003 --> 01:39:04.838
VERY SMALL UNIVERSE OF PEOPLE

01:39:04.905 --> 01:39:07.274
WHO NEED EVERY DOLLAR AVAILABLE

01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:08.509
UNDER THEIR POLICY IN ORDER

01:39:08.575 --> 01:39:10.110
TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET OKAY

01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:11.612
SO WE'RE REALLY ARE HERE TO

01:39:11.679 --> 01:39:13.881
FOCUS ON THOSE PEOPLE RIGHT SO

01:39:13.947 --> 01:39:16.083
WE HAVE THE FACT THAT A LOT OF

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:17.584
PEOPLE TWO THIRDS OF THE PEOPLE

01:39:17.651 --> 01:39:18.419
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH COVERAGE

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:20.854
OVERALL THAT'S THAT'S A WE HAVE

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:22.323
A REAL SERIOUS MARKET PLACE

01:39:22.389 --> 01:39:25.492
PROBLEM OKAY -- THERE THEN WE

01:39:25.559 --> 01:39:28.295
HAVE THE THE PROOF REQUIREMENTS

01:39:28.362 --> 01:39:30.130
WE KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:31.999
INSURERS DID IN FACT STEP

01:39:32.066 --> 01:39:34.535
UP VOLUNTARILY AND SO THERE

01:39:34.601 --> 01:39:36.337
TO DO SEVENTY AND SOME DID A

01:39:36.403 --> 01:39:38.972
HUNDRED -- PAY OUT ON CONTENTS

01:39:39.039 --> 01:39:41.241
WITHOUT ITEMS ATION BUT SAME

01:39:41.308 --> 01:39:42.443
FRUSTRATION I HAD BUT THEN

01:39:42.509 --> 01:39:43.577
YOU SAY WELL WHY CAN'T WE JUST

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:45.312
MAKE THAT A LAW NO NO NO NO

01:39:45.379 --> 01:39:46.680
NO AND THEN WE HAVE THIS WHOLE

01:39:46.747 --> 01:39:49.883
ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT I I CAN'T

01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:51.352
GET AWAY FROM THE LOGIC BECAUSE

01:39:51.418 --> 01:39:53.220
SO MANY OF THE THOUSANDS OF

01:39:53.287 --> 01:39:54.822
FIRE SURVIVORS I'VE WORKED WITH

01:39:54.888 --> 01:39:56.623
SEE IT THE SAME WAY I SEE IT

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:58.859
WHICH IS IF I PAID A PREMIUM

01:39:58.926 --> 01:40:01.495
FOR TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

01:40:01.562 --> 01:40:02.996
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND CONTENTS

01:40:03.063 --> 01:40:05.399
COVERAGE AND EVERYTHING I HAVE

01:40:05.466 --> 01:40:07.101
IS GONE WHY AREN'T I GETTING

01:40:07.167 --> 01:40:08.068
A CHECK FOR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:40:08.135 --> 01:40:10.070
THOUSAND SO I DO THINK WE NEED

01:40:10.137 --> 01:40:11.739
JUST TO REALLY HAVE A SIT DOWN

01:40:11.805 --> 01:40:14.341
AND NOT WITH A LOT OF YOU KNOW

01:40:14.408 --> 01:40:16.643
NOT NEW GET A LOVE THE MEDIA

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:18.011
BUT MAYBE YOU KNOW CLOSE THE

01:40:18.078 --> 01:40:20.848
DOOR LITTLE MORE FREE TALKING

01:40:20.914 --> 01:40:22.616
-- TO GET SOME OF THE INSURANCE

01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:24.351
EXECUTIVES TO SAY WHAT THEY

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:25.719
CAN DO BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU

01:40:25.786 --> 01:40:27.421
KNOW WHEN WE HAD STEVE BOYS

01:40:27.488 --> 01:40:29.056
NEGOTIATED THE VOLUNTARY CLAIMS

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:31.425
ARE FORMS -- DAVE JONES HAS

01:40:31.492 --> 01:40:33.327
HAS -- KEPT THOSE IN PLACE

01:40:33.394 --> 01:40:35.596
AFTER EVERY DISASTER SO WE KNOW

01:40:35.662 --> 01:40:37.564
THAT THE CARRIERS CAN DO SOME

01:40:37.631 --> 01:40:39.700
THINGS TO MAKE OF THEIR THEIR

01:40:39.767 --> 01:40:41.969
CUSTOMERS -- LIVES BETTER BUT

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:44.605
ALSO TO TO DO WHAT WE ALL WANT

01:40:44.671 --> 01:40:46.874
THEM TO DO WHICH IS PAY AS MUCH

01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:48.375
AS YOU CAN AS QUICKLY AS YOU

01:40:48.442 --> 01:40:50.344
CAN SO PEOPLE ARE IN A POSITION

01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:52.279
TO MAKE DECISIONS AND YOU DON'T

01:40:52.346 --> 01:40:53.714
HAVE THIS WHOLE RIPPLE EFFECT

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:55.149
OF WHY KEITH WOODS AND I ARE

01:40:55.215 --> 01:40:57.017
CONSTANTLY ON PANELS TOGETHER

01:40:57.084 --> 01:40:58.452
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW

01:40:58.519 --> 01:40:59.586
WHY DO WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY

01:40:59.653 --> 01:41:02.022
TWO HOMES AND YOU KNOW REBUILT

01:41:02.089 --> 01:41:03.991
AND IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR SO

01:41:04.057 --> 01:41:05.426
THERE'S THERE'S THE THERE ARE

01:41:05.492 --> 01:41:07.294
SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT I THINK

01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:09.863
WITH THE WITH THE THE TAKING OF

01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:11.265
EXPANDING THE VOLUNTARY CLOSER

01:41:11.331 --> 01:41:12.433
FORMS YEAH WE COULDN'T GET IT

01:41:12.499 --> 01:41:13.734
THROUGH AN LEGISLATION BUT WE

01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:15.402
KNOW WE'VE GOT A BIG RUNNING

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:17.438
START HERE I'M YOU KNOW AND

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:19.873
AND AND AGAIN I MEAN -- THE

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:22.676
FOR THE FACT THAT THE INSURERS

01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:24.211
THAT REX IS SAYING THAT THERE

01:41:24.278 --> 01:41:25.312
ARE I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY

01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:26.480
INVESTMENT INCOME IS SUPPOSED

01:41:26.547 --> 01:41:27.781
TO PROFITS WERE WIPED OUT BUT

01:41:27.848 --> 01:41:30.217
REGARDLESS IF IF IN FACT YOU

01:41:30.284 --> 01:41:31.718
KNOW YEAH THIS WAS THIS WAS

01:41:31.785 --> 01:41:33.520
THIS WAS AN EXPENSIVE OBVIOUSLY

01:41:33.587 --> 01:41:35.589
FIRE OF BUT AGAIN YOU HAVE

01:41:35.656 --> 01:41:36.924
TO LOOK AT IN THE CONTEXT OF

01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:38.525
THEIR BROADER THEY OF THEIR

01:41:38.592 --> 01:41:40.260
BROADER CUSTOMER BASE THIS IS

01:41:40.327 --> 01:41:42.029
STILL A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE

01:41:42.095 --> 01:41:44.131
OF THEIR CUSTOMERS SO I THINK

01:41:44.198 --> 01:41:46.200
YOU KNOW AGAIN WILDFIRE TOTAL

01:41:46.266 --> 01:41:47.935
LOSSES ARE DIFFERENT THEY NEED

01:41:48.001 --> 01:41:49.269
TO BE TREATED TO THEY NEED

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:50.604
TO BE ADJUSTED DIFFERENTLY

01:41:50.671 --> 01:41:52.806
ALL THIS THIS DEPRECIATION

01:41:52.873 --> 01:41:54.208
AND A WHOLE BOX OF ACTUAL

01:41:54.274 --> 01:41:57.811
CASH VALUE I UNDERSTAND WHY

01:41:57.878 --> 01:41:59.880
INSURERS DO THAT IN THE DAY TO

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:01.582
DAY CLAIMS BUT IN A SITUATION

01:42:01.648 --> 01:42:04.218
LIKE THIS IS JUST CRUEL

01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:07.821
SO I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER

01:42:07.888 --> 01:42:09.990
-- WELL I THINK THE CHALLENGE

01:42:10.057 --> 01:42:13.360
FOR FOR FOR YOUR CHURCH

01:42:13.427 --> 01:42:16.096
CARRIERS TRY TO PREDICT LOSSES

01:42:16.163 --> 01:42:17.397
RIGHT THEY'VE GOT TEAMS OF

01:42:17.464 --> 01:42:18.832
ACTUARIES TO TRY TO FIGURE THIS

01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:20.367
STUFF OUT THE MODELS ARE ALL

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:22.069
BLOWN TO HELL I MEAN NOBODY

01:42:22.135 --> 01:42:23.303
THOUGHT COPY PARK WITH BURKE

01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:24.938
COPY PARK IS NOT A WILD FIRES

01:42:25.005 --> 01:42:28.709
ON SO THAT THE I THINK THE WAY

01:42:28.775 --> 01:42:29.710
THAT THE INSURANCE CARRIERS

01:42:29.776 --> 01:42:30.811
HAVE LOOKED AT THESE MODELING'S

01:42:30.878 --> 01:42:32.679
AND TRY TO PRICE THEIR BUSINESS

01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:33.981
-- YOU KNOW SOME OF THAT STUFF

01:42:34.047 --> 01:42:35.082
GOING OUT THE WINDOW MORE HAVE

01:42:35.148 --> 01:42:37.384
AND -- HURRICANES GO PLACES

01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:38.151
THEY HAVEN'T GONE WE'RE HAVING

01:42:38.218 --> 01:42:39.152
TORNADOES IN PLACES THEY

01:42:39.219 --> 01:42:41.154
HAVEN'T GONE SO -- YOU KNOW

01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:42.990
THE THE THE THE FORTUNATE THING

01:42:43.056 --> 01:42:44.825
FOR FOR THIS TERRIBLE EVENT

01:42:44.892 --> 01:42:46.326
THAT WE HAD IS THAT IT WOULD

01:42:46.393 --> 01:42:48.228
BECAUSE IT WAS A FIRE YOU KNOW

01:42:48.295 --> 01:42:49.696
IT WAS LARGELY AN INSURED EVENT

01:42:49.763 --> 01:42:50.864
IT WASN'T LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE

01:42:50.931 --> 01:42:51.932
OR A FLOOD WHERE WERE THOSE

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:53.567
THINGS AREN'T INSURED BUT BUT

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:55.068
I DON'T KNOW THAT THE INSURANCE

01:42:55.135 --> 01:42:59.506
CARRIERS HAVE A WAY TO -- PRICE

01:42:59.573 --> 01:43:03.577
POLICIES -- WITH WITH MODELS --

01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:05.312
BECAUSE THE MODELS ARE HOLDING

01:43:05.379 --> 01:43:07.314
UP THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE SO

01:43:07.381 --> 01:43:09.550
-- I DON'T I DON'T HAVE HOW

01:43:09.616 --> 01:43:10.684
THEY DO THAT BUT IT BUT IT IS

01:43:10.751 --> 01:43:11.952
IT IS IT IS A DIFFICULT THING

01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:13.153
FOR THEM TO DO WHEN YOU HAVE

01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:16.456
A COPY PART BURKE FOR EXAMPLE

01:43:16.523 --> 01:43:18.292
YEAH I THAT THAT MY ANGLE ON

01:43:18.358 --> 01:43:19.860
THAT LOOKING AT THAT IS --

01:43:19.927 --> 01:43:21.662
THE AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE

01:43:21.728 --> 01:43:23.196
IN THE IN THE HIGH WILD FIRST

01:43:23.263 --> 01:43:24.865
WILDFIRE RISK AREAS AND SIR

01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:26.600
WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THE

01:43:26.667 --> 01:43:28.302
ADMITTED MARKET IS -- YOU

01:43:28.368 --> 01:43:29.670
KNOW TENDING TO IS NERVOUS

01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:30.971
ABOUT THOSE AREAS THAT THE

01:43:31.038 --> 01:43:32.272
MARKET SHARE OF THE SURPLUS

01:43:32.339 --> 01:43:34.308
LINES CARRIERS INCREASING THE

01:43:34.374 --> 01:43:35.676
MARKET SHARE THE FAIR PLAN IS

01:43:35.742 --> 01:43:37.210
INCREASING IN THOSE HIGH RISK

01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:39.746
AREAS AND INSURERS -- YOU KNOW

01:43:39.813 --> 01:43:40.948
WHETHER THEY POINT TO WELL THEY

01:43:41.014 --> 01:43:42.883
POINT TO THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO

01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:44.751
CHARGE THE THE THE RATE THAT WE

01:43:44.818 --> 01:43:46.453
NEED TO STAY IN THOSE AREAS --

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:48.388
THAT THAT'S -- THAT'S ONE THING

01:43:48.455 --> 01:43:49.456
YOU HERE AND THEN THERE'S ALSO

01:43:49.523 --> 01:43:50.657
SOME OTHER ISSUES REGARDING

01:43:50.724 --> 01:43:52.059
REINSURANCE AND OTHER THINGS A

01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:53.694
BRING UP BUT YOU KNOW AS FAR AS

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:56.530
MAKING THE MARKET FUNCTION WELL

01:43:56.597 --> 01:43:57.497
YOU KNOW I THINK THERE ARE SOME

01:43:57.564 --> 01:43:59.600
INDICATORS THAT -- YOU KNOW

01:43:59.666 --> 01:44:01.234
WE GOT ISSUES AND I WITH THIS

01:44:01.301 --> 01:44:02.769
THE HIGH WILD FOR RISK AREAS

01:44:02.836 --> 01:44:04.338
THAT WE WE NEED TO BE THINKING

01:44:04.404 --> 01:44:07.507
ABOUT MOVING FORWARD YES TO THE

01:44:07.574 --> 01:44:09.443
INSURANCE INDUSTRY RESPONSE I'M

01:44:09.509 --> 01:44:10.877
I'M NOT AWARE THAT THE GENERAL

01:44:10.944 --> 01:44:12.446
INSURANCE INDUSTRY LINE WAS YOU

01:44:12.512 --> 01:44:13.680
BETTER DO WHAT WE WANT OR WE'RE

01:44:13.747 --> 01:44:14.781
GOING TO EXTORT YOU AND LEAVE

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:16.350
YOUR COMMUNITIES I JUST I DON'T

01:44:16.416 --> 01:44:17.451
BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT WE SAID

01:44:17.517 --> 01:44:19.052
THIS YEAR AND I DON'T BELIEVE

01:44:19.119 --> 01:44:20.454
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING MOVING

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.656
FORWARD WHAT I TRIED TO POINT

01:44:22.723 --> 01:44:24.324
OUT IS THAT THERE ARE SOME

01:44:24.391 --> 01:44:25.492
CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM IN THE

01:44:25.559 --> 01:44:27.294
HIGHEST RISK AREAS THAT'S WHAT

01:44:27.361 --> 01:44:29.262
DOCTOR DIXON'S RESEARCH SHOWED

01:44:29.329 --> 01:44:30.397
BUT THE ADMITTED MARKET IS

01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:32.933
STILL SERVING EVERY COMMUNITY

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.668
BUT THERE'S A PUSH AND PULL

01:44:34.735 --> 01:44:37.304
EVERY TIME THAT LET'S SAY AMY

01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:39.172
SAYS WELL JUST PAY COVERAGE

01:44:39.239 --> 01:44:40.574
LIMITS WITHOUT LOOKING AT

01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:43.276
ACTUAL LOSS OKAY RATES ARE

01:44:43.343 --> 01:44:45.746
BASED UPON HISTORICAL LOSSES

01:44:45.812 --> 01:44:48.248
AND THAT'S BUT THE NOTION THAT

01:44:48.315 --> 01:44:50.450
WE JUST WOULD REQUIRE PAYMENT

01:44:50.517 --> 01:44:51.818
AT POLICY LIMITS WITHOUT A

01:44:51.885 --> 01:44:53.020
DOCUMENT TO THE BOSS THAT'S

01:44:53.086 --> 01:44:54.254
CLEARLY GOING TO INCREASE

01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:56.189
CLAIMS PAY OUT OKAY AS A PUBLIC

01:44:56.256 --> 01:44:57.357
POLICY YOU MIGHT DECIDE YOU

01:44:57.424 --> 01:44:58.992
WANT TO DO THAT THEN WILL YOU

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:00.527
ALSO BE ADVOCATING WITH US AT

01:45:00.594 --> 01:45:02.162
THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE

01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:03.730
TO HELP US GET IT INCREASED

01:45:03.797 --> 01:45:05.465
RATES SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO

01:45:05.532 --> 01:45:07.067
PAY FOR THOSE LOSSES I DOUBT

01:45:07.134 --> 01:45:10.971
IT SO THERE'S ALWAYS PRESSURE

01:45:11.038 --> 01:45:12.973
ON INSURANCE COMPANIES YOU MUST

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.708
SAY YES TO EVERY APPLICATION

01:45:14.775 --> 01:45:16.610
YOU MUST RENEW EVERYONE BUT

01:45:16.677 --> 01:45:17.744
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU CHARGE

01:45:17.811 --> 01:45:19.146
ADEQUATE RATES FOR THE BUSINESS

01:45:19.212 --> 01:45:20.213
YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND BY THE

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:21.715
WAY ASK FEWER QUESTIONS WHEN

01:45:21.782 --> 01:45:23.316
YOU'RE PAYING CLAIMS AND MAKE

01:45:23.383 --> 01:45:25.185
SURE YOU'RE MORE GENEROUS

01:45:25.252 --> 01:45:26.920
THOSE ALL TOGETHER MAKE IT

01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:28.288
DIFFICULT TO DO BUSINESS IN

01:45:28.355 --> 01:45:30.057
EVERY COMMUNITY SO WE'RE TRYING

01:45:30.123 --> 01:45:31.658
OUR BEST TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:45:31.725 --> 01:45:32.893
TO SERVE IN EVERY COMMUNITY

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:34.861
BECAUSE INSURANCE AGENTS ARE

01:45:34.928 --> 01:45:36.363
IN EVERY COMMUNITY THERE ON

01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:39.399
EVERY LITTLE LEAGUE FENCE JUST

01:45:39.466 --> 01:45:41.001
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WHO WHO

01:45:41.068 --> 01:45:42.703
TALKED WITH LOCAL KNOWLEDGE

01:45:42.769 --> 01:45:43.804
INSURANCE PROFESSIONALS ARE

01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:45.472
THERE AS WELL CALIFORNIA'S AN

01:45:45.539 --> 01:45:47.040
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT PLACE TO

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:49.376
DO BUSINESS BUT YET OUR RATES

01:45:49.443 --> 01:45:51.311
HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE BELOW

01:45:51.378 --> 01:45:53.246
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THEIR

01:45:53.313 --> 01:45:55.348
HALF OF WHAT THE AVERAGE IS IN

01:45:55.415 --> 01:45:57.951
TEXAS AND IN FLORIDA SO IT'S

01:45:58.018 --> 01:45:59.186
NOT AS IF INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:45:59.252 --> 01:46:01.088
ARE SAYING WE NEED CRAZY

01:46:01.154 --> 01:46:02.723
RATES AND IF YOU DON'T DO IT

01:46:02.789 --> 01:46:04.291
BAD THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN

01:46:04.357 --> 01:46:06.126
BUT WE DID NEGOTIATE WITH THE

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:07.694
LEGISLATURE ELEVEN BILLS TO

01:46:07.761 --> 01:46:10.297
COMPLETION THIS YEAR IN EACH

01:46:10.363 --> 01:46:12.265
ONE ADDED INCREMENTAL COSTS TO

01:46:12.332 --> 01:46:13.467
THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN

01:46:13.533 --> 01:46:14.935
CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE

01:46:15.001 --> 01:46:16.136
TO RECOVER THOSE IN RATES AS

01:46:16.203 --> 01:46:19.272
WELL SO IT'S NOT AS IF WE JUST

01:46:19.339 --> 01:46:22.075
SAT BACK AND SAID NO WE WORKED

01:46:22.142 --> 01:46:25.979
TRULY HARD FOR SEVEN MONTHS

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:27.447
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST

01:46:27.514 --> 01:46:28.715
COMPROMISE SO THAT WE COULD

01:46:28.782 --> 01:46:30.450
BE GOOD PARTICIPANTS IN THE

01:46:30.517 --> 01:46:31.952
CALIFORNIA BUSINESS COMMUNITY

01:46:32.018 --> 01:46:33.120
AND ALL COMMUNITIES FOR THAT

01:46:33.186 --> 01:46:35.455
MATTER -- AND THAT'S WHAT WE

01:46:35.522 --> 01:46:37.190
WANT WE'RE HERE TO PROBLEM

01:46:37.257 --> 01:46:38.592
SOLVE WITH YOU AND ACKNOWLEDGE

01:46:38.658 --> 01:46:39.793
IF WE HAVE PROBLEMS WE WANT

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:40.927
TO HEAR ABOUT IT AND WE WANT

01:46:40.994 --> 01:46:42.429
TO WORK WITH YOU TO ADDRESS

01:46:42.496 --> 01:46:45.432
THEM WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO TO

01:46:45.499 --> 01:46:47.367
TO TO BE TOLD WE SHOULD DO

01:46:47.434 --> 01:46:49.336
BETTER WERE OPEN FOR THAT BUT

01:46:49.402 --> 01:46:50.704
THE NOTION THAT THERE'S JUST

01:46:50.771 --> 01:46:53.140
A SOME SORT OF MASS PROBLEM

01:46:53.206 --> 01:46:55.375
THERE SO MANY SO MANY CUSTOMERS

01:46:55.442 --> 01:46:56.376

SO MANY PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:47:00.747 --> 01:47:02.315
WONDERFUL CLAIMS EXPERIENCES

01:47:02.382 --> 01:47:03.250
BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONES WHO

01:47:03.316 --> 01:47:04.084

01:47:04.151 --> 01:47:05.986

AN ASSET LIKE A CAR THEY CAN

01:47:28.575 --> 01:47:30.343

01:47:46.393 --> 01:47:49.095
FROM A LENDER THE PIPE THAT

01:47:49.162 --> 01:47:51.264
HOME AND I'M I DON'T HAVE THE

01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:52.666
MORTGAGE INDUSTRY AT THE TABLE

01:47:52.732 --> 01:47:54.734
BUT ARE THE A MAJOR FORCE IN

01:47:54.801 --> 01:47:56.236
SAYING YOU'VE GOT OF ME YOU'RE

01:47:56.303 --> 01:47:59.005
MANDATED TO BUY THIS INSURANCE

01:47:59.072 --> 01:48:00.807
YEAH I MEAN AND AND THAT'S

01:48:00.874 --> 01:48:02.275
PART OF THE EDUCATION THAT WE

01:48:02.342 --> 01:48:03.210
HAVE TO DO WITH OUR CLIENTS

01:48:03.276 --> 01:48:05.178
TO ME OFTENTIMES WE WE GET A

01:48:05.245 --> 01:48:07.747
-- INFORMATION FROM A CLIENT

01:48:07.814 --> 01:48:08.815
SAYING I'M BUYING THIS HOUSE

01:48:08.882 --> 01:48:09.850
HERE'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST

01:48:09.916 --> 01:48:11.618
MY LOAN IS -- FIVE HUNDRED AND

01:48:11.685 --> 01:48:13.286
THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:48:13.353 --> 01:48:15.222
-- DOUBT THAT HOUSE MIGHT BE

01:48:15.288 --> 01:48:16.890
WORTH EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND OR

01:48:16.957 --> 01:48:18.091
MY COST EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:48:18.158 --> 01:48:19.726
DOLLARS TO REPLACE ITSELF SO

01:48:19.793 --> 01:48:21.695
THAT'S WHERE -- YOU KNOW THE

01:48:21.761 --> 01:48:23.096
CONSUMERS DON'T NECESSARILY

01:48:23.163 --> 01:48:25.265
ALWAYS THINK I NEED TO ENSURE

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:27.133
FOR THE SCENARIO I'VE USUALLY

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:28.168
TO ENSURE FOR OLD WILL MY

01:48:28.235 --> 01:48:30.170
LOAN IS BUT -- YOU KNOW AGAIN

01:48:30.237 --> 01:48:32.873
IF THAT HOUSE BURNS -- IF

01:48:32.939 --> 01:48:34.074
EVERYTHING IN THAT THAT HOUSE

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:35.775
BURNS ON WHAT IS IT GONNA

01:48:35.842 --> 01:48:38.211
TAKE TO TO -- TO REBUILD IT

01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:39.412
THAT'S THAT'S THE EDUCATION

01:48:39.479 --> 01:48:40.580
PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO DO

01:48:40.647 --> 01:48:42.415
WITH THE CLIENTS AND HELP

01:48:42.482 --> 01:48:44.517
THEM UNDERSTAND AND IN HEALTH

01:48:44.584 --> 01:48:45.752
HAVE THEM HELP US UNDERSTAND

01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:47.954
WHAT THEIR TOTAL LOSS SCENARIO

01:48:48.021 --> 01:48:49.322
WOULD LOOK LIKE SO THAT THEY

01:48:49.389 --> 01:48:50.457
CAN GET OUT WE CAN PROVIDE

01:48:50.523 --> 01:48:51.725
ADEQUATE COVERAGE FOR THAT

01:48:51.791 --> 01:48:53.526
SO THE VICE MAYOR POINTED OUT

01:48:53.593 --> 01:48:56.296
THAT WE CAN EXPECT THE NUMBER

01:48:56.363 --> 01:48:58.899
OF LOTS BEING SOLD IS THAT

01:48:58.965 --> 01:49:01.268
BECAUSE OF BANK TRANSACTIONS

01:49:01.334 --> 01:49:02.335
WHERE THEY JUST FINALLY SAID I

01:49:02.402 --> 01:49:04.571
CAN'T MAKE THE MONTHLY PAYMENT

01:49:04.638 --> 01:49:07.540
I GOTTA JUST CUT ARM WHAT

01:49:07.607 --> 01:49:08.842
WE'RE SEE WE'RE SEEING A LOT

01:49:08.909 --> 01:49:11.077
OF THE THE THE LENDERS KEEPING

01:49:11.144 --> 01:49:12.479
THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR

01:49:12.545 --> 01:49:13.680
I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:49:13.747 --> 01:49:15.015
BORROWERS I MEAN IN A PERFECT

01:49:15.081 --> 01:49:16.883
WORLD THE LENDER STICKS WITH

01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:18.318
THEM INSURANCE COMPANY STICKS

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:19.386
WITH THEM THROUGH THAT REBUILD

01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:20.854
PROCESS THE INSURANCE OR IS THE

01:49:20.921 --> 01:49:22.522
NEW HOUSE THE THE THE LENDER

01:49:22.589 --> 01:49:24.157
HAS THE SAME LOAN OR WORKED

01:49:24.224 --> 01:49:25.091
WITH THEM ON A CONSTRUCTION

01:49:25.158 --> 01:49:26.293
LOAN THAT THAT'S IN A PERFECT

01:49:26.359 --> 01:49:28.194
WORLD BUT MOST OF THE LOTS THAT

01:49:28.261 --> 01:49:29.629
WE SEE GOING UP FOR SALE ARE

01:49:29.696 --> 01:49:32.432
PEOPLE THAT HAVE -- EITHER JUST

01:49:32.499 --> 01:49:34.000
MOVED OUT OF THE AREA OR SIMPLY

01:49:34.067 --> 01:49:35.335
BOUGHT ANOTHER HOUSE AND AND

01:49:35.402 --> 01:49:37.237
THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY WERE ON

01:49:37.304 --> 01:49:38.038
THE FENCE IF THEY WERE GONNA

01:49:38.104 --> 01:49:39.205
REBUILD OR NOT BUT THEY'VE

01:49:39.272 --> 01:49:40.674
DECIDED TO DO STUFF WITH A

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:42.575
LOT ON THE MARKET AND SELL THE

01:49:42.642 --> 01:49:43.877
CASE SO I JUST LOOK AT MORTGAGE

01:49:43.944 --> 01:49:46.279
COMPANIES AS A FORCE THAT ISN'T

01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:47.280
RESIDENT THE ROOM ARE THERE ANY

01:49:47.347 --> 01:49:50.150
OTHER FORCES THAT ARE DICTATING

01:49:50.216 --> 01:49:53.386
WHAT PURCHASE WHAT A PURCHASER

01:49:53.453 --> 01:49:54.788
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT FOR THE

01:49:54.854 --> 01:49:56.756
AMOUNT OF COVERAGE THERE ARE

01:49:56.823 --> 01:49:58.024
I'M NOT REALLY IN IT I THINK

01:49:58.091 --> 01:49:59.159
IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT TO

01:49:59.225 --> 01:50:00.360
THE MORTGAGE COMPANY ONLY WANT

01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:01.594
TO PROTECT THEIR THEIR LOAN

01:50:01.661 --> 01:50:02.762
VALUE THEY DON'T CARE FOR THE

01:50:02.829 --> 01:50:04.230
THE HOMEOWNERS AND MAY HOLE IN

01:50:04.297 --> 01:50:05.665
A IN A LOSS SITUATION AS LONG

01:50:05.732 --> 01:50:08.868
AS THEIR LOAN IS PROTECTED SO

01:50:08.935 --> 01:50:10.770
I BELIEVE THAT SOME THOUGH WILL

01:50:10.837 --> 01:50:12.105
REQUIRE THAT THE POLICY BE A

01:50:12.172 --> 01:50:13.840
REPLACEMENT VALUE POLICY NUMBER

01:50:13.907 --> 01:50:17.811
IN A CD I HAVE SEEN THAT NEW ON

01:50:17.877 --> 01:50:19.346
IN A MORE LOCK IT I'M JUST

01:50:19.412 --> 01:50:21.481
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE WE'VE

01:50:21.548 --> 01:50:23.984
GOT SOME FORCE SOMEBODY SALAS

01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:25.785
THE BY A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND

01:50:25.852 --> 01:50:28.154
THEN WE CAN GO FROM A YOU GO TO

01:50:28.221 --> 01:50:31.825
A CADILLAC OUR CHOICE CORRECT

01:50:31.891 --> 01:50:32.792
I MEAN AND THEN YOU KNOW THEN

01:50:32.859 --> 01:50:34.260
THAT A ROUGHLY A THIRD OF HOMES

01:50:34.327 --> 01:50:35.829
DON'T HAVE MORTGAGES SO YOU

01:50:35.895 --> 01:50:37.297
KNOW INDIA THAN THAT YOU DON'T

01:50:37.364 --> 01:50:38.398
HAVE THAT PRESSURE IN THAT

01:50:38.465 --> 01:50:40.867
CASE MADE AND WE ARE SEEING A

01:50:40.934 --> 01:50:42.268
MY ORGANIZATION IS DEFINITELY

01:50:42.335 --> 01:50:43.603
SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER

01:50:43.670 --> 01:50:45.372
OF DISASTER VICTIMS WHO HAVE

01:50:45.438 --> 01:50:46.873
NO INSURANCE IN THE LAST FEW

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:49.242
YEARS BUT I I MEAN AND IF IF I

01:50:49.309 --> 01:50:51.711
CAN TAKE ONE MINUTE -- I AM NOT

TO THRIVE AND AND BE HEALTHY

-- I THINK CERTAINLY OBVIOUSLY

01:51:00.086 --> 01:51:01.421
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:51:01.488 --> 01:51:03.656
COME OUT FINE -- BUT WE'RE HERE

01:51:03.723 --> 01:51:04.591

FOOLISH WHEN YOU'RE INSURING

IS AND AND AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE

BEEN FULLY ANTICIPATING THAT

01:51:22.542 --> 01:51:23.576
RATES ARE GOING TO ARE GOING

01:51:23.643 --> 01:51:25.712
TO BE GOING UP GIVEN CLIMATE

01:51:25.779 --> 01:51:27.380
CHANGE IT'S IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS

01:51:27.447 --> 01:51:29.015
IT'S WE WORK IN OTHER STATES

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:30.016

IS STILL A HEALTHY WE WANT TO

01:51:34.988 --> 01:51:36.489
KEEP IT HEALTHY BUT I THINK

01:51:36.556 --> 01:51:40.393
YOU KNOW WHAT THE THE THE CAR

01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:43.329
COMPETITION BETWEEN INSURERS

01:51:43.396 --> 01:51:45.365
FOR CLIENTS IS PART OF WHAT'S

01:51:45.432 --> 01:51:46.666
FUELING THIS UNDER INSURANCE

01:51:46.733 --> 01:51:48.935
PROBLEM IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU

01:51:49.002 --> 01:51:50.403
YOU KNOW I'D HAVE HAD A LOT

01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:51.905
OF INSURANCE EXACTS POINT THE

01:51:51.971 --> 01:51:53.306
FINGERS AT A COMPETITORS THEY

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:55.442
WILL THEY THEY LOW BALLED THE

01:51:55.508 --> 01:51:57.610
ESTIMATE SO I GOT A LOW BALL

01:51:57.677 --> 01:51:59.079
THE ESTIMATE IF I WANT TO

01:51:59.145 --> 01:52:01.247

01:52:01.314 --> 01:52:03.383
THAT CLIENT AND YEAH YOU KNOW

01:52:03.450 --> 01:52:04.617
I AND I DON'T KNOW VERY MANY

01:52:04.684 --> 01:52:06.753
CONSUMERS ARE SUPER KEEN TO

01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:08.254
PAY ANYMORE FOR INSURANCE AND

01:52:08.321 --> 01:52:09.155
THE ABSOLUTE FEEL LIKE THEY

01:52:09.222 --> 01:52:11.291
HAVE TO BUT THE REALITY IS

01:52:11.357 --> 01:52:13.426
THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU

01:52:13.493 --> 01:52:14.994
YOU JUST HAVE AN EXPECTATION

01:52:15.061 --> 01:52:16.996
IN THE PUBLIC'S MIND THAT THE

01:52:17.063 --> 01:52:18.331
INSURANCE PROFESSIONALS KNOW

01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:19.265
THEIR JOB AND THEY'RE GONNA

01:52:19.332 --> 01:52:21.501
TALENT SO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

01:52:21.568 --> 01:52:22.302
THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN

01:52:22.368 --> 01:52:24.170
COMING TO OUR OVERFLOW YOU KNOW

01:52:24.237 --> 01:52:26.773
THREE HUNDRED OF OF PEOPLE AT

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.908
A SHOT WORKSHOPS ALMOST EVERY

01:52:28.975 --> 01:52:30.176
ONE OF THE MOST WILL TELL

01:52:30.243 --> 01:52:31.678
YOU AND THEY WILL TAKE A LIE

01:52:31.744 --> 01:52:32.979
DETECTOR TEST AND TELL YOU

01:52:33.046 --> 01:52:35.482
THIS YOU KNOW I ASKED IF I HAD

01:52:35.548 --> 01:52:36.983
FULL COVERAGE AND I WAS TOLD

01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:38.184
MY COVERAGE WAS ADEQUATE AND

01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:39.686
I'VE SEEN THE COMMUNICATION

01:52:39.752 --> 01:52:41.321
BETWEEN THE CONSUMERS AND

01:52:41.387 --> 01:52:42.255
THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

01:52:42.322 --> 01:52:43.790
AGENTS AND THEY WERE LULLED

01:52:43.857 --> 01:52:45.125
INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY

01:52:45.191 --> 01:52:47.594
AND WE JUST HAVE TO BREAK OKAY

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:48.895
ANOTHER MISTER FRAZIER QUICK

01:52:48.962 --> 01:52:50.663
RESPONSE THAT YEAH BUT THAT'S

01:52:50.730 --> 01:52:53.700
THE I CAN'T LET THAT STAND

01:52:53.766 --> 01:52:58.371
WHEN MY ON WHEN IF INDEED

01:52:58.438 --> 01:53:00.440
AN AGENT WOULD SAY I'M

01:53:00.507 --> 01:53:01.674
GUARANTEEING THE ADEQUACY

01:53:01.741 --> 01:53:03.343
OF COVERAGE THE POLICY IS

01:53:03.409 --> 01:53:04.410
CONVERTED TO A GUARANTEED

01:53:04.477 --> 01:53:05.712
REPLACEMENT COST POLICY BY

01:53:05.778 --> 01:53:08.515
VIRTUE OF THAT REPRESENTATION

01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:11.584
SO THE NOTION THAT SOMEONE

01:53:11.651 --> 01:53:12.652
WOULD BE LULLED INTO A

01:53:12.719 --> 01:53:14.154
FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY BY

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:15.421
MISREPRESENTATION AND HAVE

01:53:15.488 --> 01:53:16.890
NO RECOURSE THAT'S SIMPLY NOT

01:53:16.956 --> 01:53:18.758
THE LAW IN CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE

01:53:18.825 --> 01:53:20.126
RECOURSE IN THAT COMPANY IS

01:53:20.193 --> 01:53:22.262
GOING TO PAY THAT CLAIM NOW

01:53:22.328 --> 01:53:25.532
WHAT I SEE HAPPEN IS YOU KNOW

01:53:25.598 --> 01:53:26.599
THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE

01:53:26.666 --> 01:53:30.637
WILL EXAMINE SITUATIONS WHERE

01:53:30.703 --> 01:53:32.305
-- COMPANY A WOULD GIVE A

01:53:32.372 --> 01:53:33.673
REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATE OF A

01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:36.876
CERTAIN AMOUNT AND -- THERE'S

01:53:36.943 --> 01:53:38.244
THERE'S NO DOUBT WHAT THEY'RE

01:53:38.311 --> 01:53:40.113
CALCULATING AS THEIR ESTIMATE

01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:41.447
BUT LET'S SAY IT'S LOWER THAN

01:53:41.514 --> 01:53:42.815
COMPANY BE COMING ALONG AND

01:53:42.882 --> 01:53:45.652
SAYING WELL -- THAT YOU REALLY

01:53:45.718 --> 01:53:46.786
NEED TO GO HIGHER IN YOUR

01:53:46.853 --> 01:53:48.688
COVERAGE AND THE DEPARTMENT

01:53:48.755 --> 01:53:51.291
OF INSURANCE AS LONG AS THE

01:53:51.357 --> 01:53:54.194
THE -- THE COMPANY HAS BEEN

01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:55.395
FORTHRIGHT IN SAYING THIS IS

01:53:55.461 --> 01:53:56.996
WHAT WE CALCULATE YOUR ESTIMATE

01:53:57.063 --> 01:54:00.200
ADS -- IF OFTENTIMES IF AN

01:54:00.266 --> 01:54:02.001
AGENT IF THE SECOND AGENT CAN'T

01:54:02.068 --> 01:54:03.236
COME ALONG AND SAY NO NO THAT'S

01:54:03.303 --> 01:54:04.170
NOT ENOUGH YOU REALLY NEED

01:54:04.237 --> 01:54:07.173
TO PAY MORE AND GET THIS --

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:09.275
THEN THE LAW DOES NOT PREVENT

01:54:09.342 --> 01:54:10.777
THE PERSON FROM CHOOSING THE

01:54:10.843 --> 01:54:11.978
LOWER AMOUNT OF COVERAGE AS

01:54:12.045 --> 01:54:13.279
LONG AS THERE'S BEEN ADEQUATE

01:54:13.346 --> 01:54:15.215
DISCLOSURE BECAUSE IN THE END

01:54:15.281 --> 01:54:16.482
IT'S THE CUSTOMER'S CHOICE

01:54:16.549 --> 01:54:17.750
AS TO HOW MUCH INSURANCE THEY

01:54:17.817 --> 01:54:20.920
WANT TO PURCHASE IT'S AN SO

01:54:20.987 --> 01:54:23.556
THERE IS NO LAW THAT SAYS --

01:54:23.623 --> 01:54:25.525
AN INSURANCE AGENT FOR INSTANCE

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:28.094
HAS A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO PUT

01:54:28.161 --> 01:54:29.562
THE CUSTOMER'S INTERESTS FIRST

01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:30.463
IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY'RE

01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:31.764
RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT

01:54:31.831 --> 01:54:32.966
GOES WRONG AFTERWARD THAT'S

01:54:33.032 --> 01:54:35.602
SIMPLY NOT THE LAW OKAY VERY

01:54:35.668 --> 01:54:38.171
GOOD SO WHAT AT CENTER YOU

01:54:38.238 --> 01:54:39.606
VERY GOOD I HAVE ASSEMBLY

01:54:39.672 --> 01:54:41.441
MEMBER GIPSON THANK YOU VERY

01:54:41.507 --> 01:54:43.509
MUCH OF MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID

01:54:43.576 --> 01:54:45.144
RATHER HAVE INSURANCE THE NOT

01:54:45.211 --> 01:54:47.146
NEEDED THEY NEEDED NOT HAVE IT

01:54:47.213 --> 01:54:49.082
AND SO MY QUESTION IS IS WHAT

01:54:49.148 --> 01:54:50.149
IS THE LIKELIHOOD INSURANCE

01:54:50.216 --> 01:54:52.051
COMPANIES WILL STOP WRITING AND

01:54:52.118 --> 01:54:53.720
RENEWING HOMEOWNERS POLICIES

01:54:53.786 --> 01:54:55.722
IN AREAS OF HIGH FIRE RISK

01:54:55.788 --> 01:54:57.323
MOVING FORWARD SO THAT'S MY

01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:58.791
QUESTION AND THAT'S SOME OF

01:54:58.858 --> 01:55:02.729
THE CONCERNS IN WHICH -- --

01:55:02.795 --> 01:55:03.997
PEOPLE HAVE CONVEYED MESSAGES

01:55:04.063 --> 01:55:05.865
TO ME THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION

01:55:05.932 --> 01:55:07.600
SURE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:55:07.667 --> 01:55:10.036
GIPSON -- OUR OUR HOPE IS

01:55:10.103 --> 01:55:11.904
THAT THE MARKET WILL ATTRACT

01:55:11.971 --> 01:55:13.806
NEW ENTRANCE AND MAKE SURE

01:55:13.873 --> 01:55:15.174
THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME

01:55:15.241 --> 01:55:16.943
COMPANIES WHO THEY LOOK AT A

01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:18.945
COMMUNITY AND FEEL OVER EXPOSED

01:55:19.012 --> 01:55:20.480
IN BECAUSE IT GEOGRAPHIC OVER

01:55:20.546 --> 01:55:22.649
OVER CONCENTRATION THEY START

01:55:22.715 --> 01:55:24.617
EXPRESSING RETICENCE TO ACCEPT

01:55:24.684 --> 01:55:26.486
A RAMP EVERY APPLICATION AND

01:55:26.552 --> 01:55:27.587
THE HOPE IS THAT THE MARKET IS

01:55:27.654 --> 01:55:29.188
HEALTHY ENOUGH TO ATTRACT NEW

01:55:29.255 --> 01:55:30.523
ENTRANTS INTO THE MARKETPLACE

01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:31.958
AND IN FACT DOCTOR DIXON STUDY

01:55:32.025 --> 01:55:34.093
SHOWS THAT IN THE VERY HIGHEST

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:36.296
RISK ZIP CODES THERE IS A

01:55:36.362 --> 01:55:38.031
HIGHER THAN AVERAGE NUMBER OF

01:55:38.097 --> 01:55:39.265
CARRIERS COMPETING IN THOSE

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:42.035
AREAS SO -- MY HOPE IS THAT THE

01:55:42.101 --> 01:55:44.270
MARKET WILL STAY HEALTHY BUT --

01:55:44.337 --> 01:55:45.972
WHAT WE ADVOCATED ALL YEAR WAS

01:55:46.039 --> 01:55:47.573
LET'S NOT CREATE A CRISIS THAT

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:50.276
DOESN'T EXIST WITH LEGISLATION

01:55:50.343 --> 01:55:52.745
THAT -- THAT TRIGGERS PROBLEMS

01:55:52.812 --> 01:55:54.380
AND SO WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE

01:55:54.447 --> 01:55:55.682
ABLE TO REACH ACCOMMODATIONS

01:55:55.748 --> 01:55:57.283
ON THOSE ELEVEN BILLS THAT

01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:58.484
MAXIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD OF

01:55:58.551 --> 01:55:59.719
COMPANIES STAYING IN THE

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:02.088
HIGHEST RISK -- ZIP CODES BUT

01:56:02.155 --> 01:56:03.289
OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T PROVIDE ANY

01:56:03.356 --> 01:56:04.590
GUARANTEES FOR ANY SPECIFIC

01:56:04.657 --> 01:56:06.192
COMPANIES ONE OF THE FOLLOW UP

01:56:06.259 --> 01:56:07.527
QUESTION HIS UP I'LL JUST ADD

01:56:07.593 --> 01:56:09.028
REAL QUICK ON THAT -- WE SEE

01:56:09.095 --> 01:56:10.363
CERTAIN KERRY'S I MEAN IN MY

01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:11.864
IN MY COMPANY WE'VE GOT A ABOUT

01:56:11.931 --> 01:56:14.534
A THOUSAND -- RE INSPECTIONS

01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:16.002
THAT ARE BEING TRIGGERED BY A

01:56:16.069 --> 01:56:17.970
WILDFIRE OR BRUSH CONCERNS BY

01:56:18.037 --> 01:56:19.872
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE SOME

01:56:19.939 --> 01:56:21.741
OF THOSE WERE WERE THE CLIENTS

01:56:21.808 --> 01:56:23.042
ARE ABLE TO MITIGATE IT SOME

01:56:23.109 --> 01:56:25.311
THEY'RE NOT BUT -- AS SOME

01:56:25.378 --> 01:56:26.779
OF THOSE CLIENTS OR CARRIERS

01:56:26.846 --> 01:56:29.382
ARE WANTING TO LESSEN THEIR

01:56:29.449 --> 01:56:31.351
EXPOSURE IN CERTAIN WILDFIRES

01:56:31.417 --> 01:56:32.719
WE WE STILL ARE SEEN NEW

01:56:32.785 --> 01:56:33.986
CARRIERS THAT ARE COMING IN THE

01:56:34.053 --> 01:56:36.189
WRITING SO -- WE'RE NOT SEEN A

01:56:36.255 --> 01:56:38.124
OF A PROBLEM WITH CAPACITY ON

01:56:38.191 --> 01:56:41.728
THAT ISSUE THREE THREE QUICKIES

01:56:41.794 --> 01:56:46.566
ONE -- -- THE ONE GOOD THING AB

01:56:46.632 --> 01:56:49.102
TWENTY TWO TWO TWO NINE -- THAT

01:56:49.168 --> 01:56:50.937
REQUIRES INSURERS TO DISCLOSE

01:56:51.003 --> 01:56:52.638
DISCOUNTS IS IS A GOOD STEP IN

01:56:52.705 --> 01:56:55.074
THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- BEFORE

01:56:55.141 --> 01:56:57.176
LAST YEAR'S FIRE SEASON I DID

01:56:57.243 --> 01:56:59.112
A RIDE ALONG IN MORAGA I'M YOUR

01:56:59.178 --> 01:57:00.980
DISTRICT WITH THE FIRE MARSHALL

01:57:01.047 --> 01:57:03.082
TO A HOME WHERE THE WHERE ALL

01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:04.917
SEATED SAID IF YOU DON'T YOU'LL

01:57:04.984 --> 01:57:07.787
GET MAKE THIS THE LAST RUSH

01:57:07.854 --> 01:57:08.888
HEAVY AROUND YOUR HOUSE WE'RE

01:57:08.955 --> 01:57:10.556
GOING TO DROP YOU SO THERE'S A

01:57:10.623 --> 01:57:12.859
LOT WE CAN DO WITH MITIGATION

01:57:12.925 --> 01:57:15.294
-- AND AND THE LAST POINT --

01:57:15.361 --> 01:57:16.696
BUT BUT WE DIDN'T WE COULDN'T

01:57:16.763 --> 01:57:17.597
GET A LOT OF COOPERATION

01:57:17.663 --> 01:57:20.266
FROM YOUR TEAM ARM ON THE

01:57:20.333 --> 01:57:22.368
LEGISLATIVE KIND OF STANDARD

01:57:22.435 --> 01:57:23.903
SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT AT

01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:26.305
ALL -- TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT

01:57:26.372 --> 01:57:29.142
WHAT KIND OF INCENTIVES COULD

01:57:29.208 --> 01:57:30.810
HOMEOWNERS GET TO MAKE THEIR

01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:31.911
HOMES LESS LIKELY TO BURN THAT

01:57:31.978 --> 01:57:33.880
KIND OF THING -- LAST FALL AND

01:57:33.946 --> 01:57:35.281
THERE IS AN INSURANCE FINDER

01:57:35.348 --> 01:57:36.582
TOOL THAT OUR ORGANIZATION

01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:38.251
HAS PIONEERED SO YOUR CALL

01:57:38.317 --> 01:57:39.552
YOUR CONSTITUENTS NEED NOT

01:57:39.619 --> 01:57:41.554
PANIC AND BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:57:41.621 --> 01:57:43.456
DEFINITELY LOTS OF OPTIONS LAST

01:57:43.523 --> 01:57:46.759
VERY LAST -- IT IN CHANGING

01:57:46.826 --> 01:57:49.395
A POLICY ADDING AN EXTENDED

01:57:49.462 --> 01:57:52.031
REPLACEMENT COST PROVISION

01:57:52.098 --> 01:57:54.367
TO A HOME POLICY THAT DOUBLES

01:57:54.434 --> 01:57:56.669
THE COVERAGE IT REALLY IS NOT

01:57:56.736 --> 01:57:59.172
THAT EXPENSIVE SO IF IT ISN'T

01:57:59.238 --> 01:58:02.008
THAT HARD ON THE HOMEOWNER TO

01:58:02.074 --> 01:58:03.609
GET BETTER COVERAGE IF THEY'RE

01:58:03.676 --> 01:58:04.577
WORKING WITH A REALLY GOOD

01:58:04.644 --> 01:58:06.779
AGENT -- SO IT JUST MAKES ALL

01:58:06.846 --> 01:58:07.980
THE DIFFERENCE TO SHORT DR

01:58:08.047 --> 01:58:09.515
DIXIT DIX YET IF THE MUSIC UP

01:58:09.582 --> 01:58:10.583
JUST A COUPLE MORE THINGS ON

01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:11.951
YOUR ON YOUR POINT OF THAT SO

01:58:12.018 --> 01:58:13.219
WE DID FIND THAT THE MARKET

01:58:13.286 --> 01:58:14.654
SHARE OF THE SURPLUS LINES

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:16.255
CARRIERS IS INCREASING A LITTLE

01:58:16.322 --> 01:58:17.523
BIT IN THESE HIGH RISK AREAS

01:58:17.590 --> 01:58:19.158
AND YOU KNOW THOSE AREN'T IS

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:20.660
-- THOROUGHLY REGULATED BY

01:58:20.726 --> 01:58:21.661
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:58:21.727 --> 01:58:23.196
INSURANCE AS THE ADMITTED --

01:58:23.262 --> 01:58:25.665
CARRIERS -- SO YOU KNOW THAT

01:58:25.731 --> 01:58:26.866
THAT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT

01:58:26.933 --> 01:58:28.100
AND THE OTHER THING WE DID FIND

01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:29.168
IS THAT IN CERTAIN AREAS THE

01:58:29.235 --> 01:58:31.971
FAIR PLAN IS INCREASING THEIR

01:58:32.038 --> 01:58:33.372
MARKET SHARE SO THAT TELLS YOU

01:58:33.439 --> 01:58:35.141
THAT THERE IS SOME YOU KNOW

01:58:35.208 --> 01:58:36.576
CONCERNS BY THE ADMITTED MARKET

01:58:36.642 --> 01:58:37.910
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S TURNOVERS

01:58:37.977 --> 01:58:38.845
AND THERE'S NEW ENTRANTS

01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:40.713
OVERALL THERE IS SOME CONCERNS

01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:41.848
AND YOU KNOW WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR

01:58:41.914 --> 01:58:43.549
THIS IN IN CALIFORNIA BUT YOU

01:58:43.616 --> 01:58:44.584
KNOW YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP

01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:45.518
OUR EYE ON THE MARKET YOU'RE

01:58:45.585 --> 01:58:46.853
THE FAIR PLAN WE DON'T WANT TO

01:58:46.919 --> 01:58:48.254
TURN TURN INTO SOMETHING LIKE

01:58:48.321 --> 01:58:49.956
HAPPEN IN FLORIDA WHERE YOU HAD

01:58:50.022 --> 01:58:53.159
A MATH OF -- -- -- -- -- THE

01:58:53.226 --> 01:58:54.827
YOU KNOW -- FAIR PLAN IN EFFECT

01:58:54.894 --> 01:58:56.729
COME INTO BEING AND ALL THE THE

01:58:56.796 --> 01:58:58.698
PROBLEMS THAT THAT COSTS SEVEN

01:58:58.764 --> 01:59:01.367
NUMBER GIPSON AUG I'LL GET

01:59:01.434 --> 01:59:02.335
YOU KNOW I'LL ASK THEM OFF

01:59:02.401 --> 01:59:03.436
LINES I KNOW FOR THE INTEREST

01:59:03.503 --> 01:59:06.339
OF TIME SENATOR LARA THANK YOU

01:59:06.405 --> 01:59:07.807
I THINK I I SHOULD JUST ASK

01:59:07.874 --> 01:59:09.575
ALL MY QUESTIONS AND THEN TO

01:59:09.642 --> 01:59:11.177
PICK AN ANSWER BECAUSE I WANNA

01:59:11.244 --> 01:59:13.813
MAKE SURE -- I GUESS I HAVE

01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:15.681
I HAVE ROUGHLY FOUR QUESTIONS

01:59:15.748 --> 01:59:18.518
FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE SO ONE FOR

01:59:18.584 --> 01:59:19.785
MISTER DIXON WE KEEP TALKING

01:59:19.852 --> 01:59:21.387
ABOUT HIGH RISK AREAS WHAT

01:59:21.454 --> 01:59:23.656
DOES THAT MEAN NOW WE HAVE NO

01:59:23.723 --> 01:59:24.957
IDEA WHAT A HIGH RISK AREA IS

01:59:25.024 --> 01:59:27.126
GOING TO BE NEXT YEAR OR THE

01:59:27.193 --> 01:59:30.296
YEAR BEFORE SO ARE AND AND

01:59:30.363 --> 01:59:31.697
THIS GIVEN CHANGING CLIMATE

01:59:31.764 --> 01:59:33.132
AND WE'VE ALWAYS TO WORK ON

01:59:33.199 --> 01:59:34.600
LEGISLATION TO TRY TO FIGURE

01:59:34.667 --> 01:59:37.470
OUT HOW WE CAN DO NEW MODELING

01:59:37.537 --> 01:59:39.071
TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:59:39.138 --> 01:59:40.573
IS A HIGH RISK AREA NOW BECAUSE

01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:41.641
CLEARLY WHAT WAS A HIGH RISK

01:59:41.707 --> 01:59:44.410
AREA BEFORE CLEARLY NOT NOW

01:59:44.477 --> 01:59:45.845
OR IS IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT

01:59:45.912 --> 01:59:49.015
SOLD OUT FOR -- MISBACH WHAT

01:59:49.081 --> 01:59:50.616
ROLE SHOULD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:53.185
PLAY INCITING YOU HOUSING

01:59:53.252 --> 01:59:57.123
AND HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT --

01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:59.325
WHERE SHOULD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:59:59.392 --> 02:00:02.328
FOLK FOCUS ON A IN TERMS OF

02:00:02.395 --> 02:00:03.596
BUILDING IN SENSITIVE AREAS

02:00:03.663 --> 02:00:04.730
WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON

02:00:04.797 --> 02:00:08.100
THAT -- THE OTHER THING IS --

02:00:08.167 --> 02:00:11.637
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE TO

02:00:11.704 --> 02:00:14.974
FACT THAT -- THE MAJORITY OF

02:00:15.041 --> 02:00:16.909
THE LEGISLATION THAT WE PASSED

02:00:16.976 --> 02:00:19.712
SEEMS TO REALLY TARGET -- THIS

02:00:19.779 --> 02:00:22.081
ISSUE PROSPECTIVELY HAVE WE

02:00:22.148 --> 02:00:23.783
DONE ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE WILL

02:00:23.849 --> 02:00:26.285
ACTUALLY SURVIVED -- THESE AS

02:00:26.352 --> 02:00:30.022
ASTERS NOW -- AND AND WHAT CAN

02:00:30.089 --> 02:00:31.257
WE DO THE OTHER THING IS AS

02:00:31.324 --> 02:00:33.726
YOU KNOW WE PASSED LEGISLATION

02:00:33.793 --> 02:00:35.828
TO -- EXPAND PROTECTIONS TO

02:00:35.895 --> 02:00:37.430
TWELVE MONTHS FOR PEOPLE WHO

02:00:37.496 --> 02:00:38.931
ARE HAVING LOST HER HOME WE'VE

02:00:38.998 --> 02:00:41.667
ALSO -- HOW TO COLLECT NEW

02:00:41.734 --> 02:00:43.769
DATA WHEN IT COMES TO FIRE

02:00:43.836 --> 02:00:45.938
RISK ASSESSMENT IF THAT DATA

02:00:46.005 --> 02:00:48.574
COMES BACK SAYING THAT -- THIS

02:00:48.641 --> 02:00:50.276
VIRUS STATE IS BEING USED TO

02:00:50.343 --> 02:00:53.279
DENY PEOPLE ACCESS TO INSURANCE

02:00:53.346 --> 02:00:55.348
WILL YOU COMMIT TO HELPING US

02:00:55.414 --> 02:00:58.918
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OKAY ENOUGH

02:00:58.985 --> 02:01:00.553
OKAY OFF THEIR -- SO YOU KNOW

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:02.121
IT'S FAR AS HIGH RISK AREAS OF

02:01:02.188 --> 02:01:03.155
REALLY GOOD QUESTION WHAT WE

02:01:03.222 --> 02:01:05.191
DID IS WE LOOK WE LOOK AT --

02:01:05.257 --> 02:01:07.393
WILD FAR MODELS -- AND LOOK AT

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:09.128
THE PERCENT OF ACRES IN EACH

02:01:09.195 --> 02:01:10.496
-- ZIP CODE THAT ARE EXPECTED

02:01:10.563 --> 02:01:12.298
THE BURN AND THEN COMBINE THAT

02:01:12.365 --> 02:01:13.199
WITH ESTIMATES OF WHERE THE

02:01:13.265 --> 02:01:15.267
POPULATION IS TO DETERMINE THE

02:01:15.334 --> 02:01:16.769
YOU KNOW THE EXPECTED AVERAGE

02:01:16.836 --> 02:01:18.137
THAT NUMBER OF STRUCTURES

02:01:18.204 --> 02:01:19.672
EXPECTED TO BURN IN ANY GIVEN

02:01:19.739 --> 02:01:21.407
YEAR SO THAT WAS A THE MEASURE

02:01:21.474 --> 02:01:23.576
OF HIGH RISK VERSUS LOW RISK

02:01:23.643 --> 02:01:24.343
AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN THINK OF

02:01:24.410 --> 02:01:25.478
THE LOW RISK ONES AND YOU KNOW

02:01:25.544 --> 02:01:26.412
THINGS ARE CHANGING BUT YOU

02:01:26.479 --> 02:01:27.947
KNOW AND VERY DENSELY URBAN OUR

02:01:28.014 --> 02:01:29.548
URBAN AREAS YOU KNOW WILD FIRES

02:01:29.615 --> 02:01:31.083
NOT A RISK AND YOU KNOW TO THE

02:01:31.150 --> 02:01:32.385
ISSUES RELATED EMBERS AND ALL

02:01:32.451 --> 02:01:34.253
THAT SO THOSE ARE OUR LOW RISK

02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:35.521
AREAS IN THE HIGHER ONES ARE IN

02:01:35.588 --> 02:01:37.023
THE YOU KNOW THE THE WILDLAND

02:01:37.089 --> 02:01:38.858
URBAN INTERFACE THE OTHER PART

02:01:38.924 --> 02:01:40.126
OF OUR STUDY WAS TO LOOK AT HOW

02:01:40.192 --> 02:01:42.461
THOSE -- THOSE HIGH WILD WILD

02:01:42.528 --> 02:01:43.596
FIRE RISK AREAS ARE EXPECTED

02:01:43.663 --> 02:01:45.031
TO CHANGE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE

02:01:45.097 --> 02:01:46.432
TO THE END OF THE CENTURY --

02:01:46.499 --> 02:01:48.300
USING THE DIFFERENT PROJECTIONS

02:01:48.367 --> 02:01:50.169
AND WE FOUND LIKE IN THE AREAS

02:01:50.236 --> 02:01:51.771
ABOVE THIS YEAR OF SACRAMENTO

02:01:51.837 --> 02:01:53.506
AND THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS DID

02:01:53.572 --> 02:01:55.241
THE EXPECTED NUMBER OF PERCENT

02:01:55.307 --> 02:01:56.809
OF ACRES TO BURN DISAFFECTED

02:01:56.876 --> 02:01:58.544
TO DOUBLE BY MID CENTURY AND

02:01:58.611 --> 02:02:00.479
THEN DOUBLED AGAIN BY THE --

02:02:00.546 --> 02:02:02.682
THE END OF THE CENTURY SO THOSE

02:02:02.748 --> 02:02:04.784
ARE -- YOU KNOW BIG NUMBERS AND

02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:06.886
-- YOU KNOW TO THIS IS THE ON

02:02:06.952 --> 02:02:08.654
GOING -- MAJOR ISSUE FOR THE

02:02:08.721 --> 02:02:10.523
STATE TO DEAL WITH AND JUST AS

02:02:10.589 --> 02:02:12.391
A SIDE ALSO IMPORT -- POINTS

02:02:12.458 --> 02:02:14.126
OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF EFFORTS

02:02:14.193 --> 02:02:15.628
TO CONTROL CARBON EMISSIONS

02:02:15.695 --> 02:02:16.962
THAT WILL THAT CAN REDUCE

02:02:17.029 --> 02:02:21.400
THAT THAT AFFECT THIS BALK

02:02:21.467 --> 02:02:23.669
OKAY -- SO ON OUR WHAT CAN

02:02:23.736 --> 02:02:25.171
LOCAL OFFICIALS DO LET'S START

02:02:25.237 --> 02:02:27.306
THERE -- CERTAINLY ENFORCE

02:02:27.373 --> 02:02:29.208
BUILDING CODES WHICH IS EASIER

02:02:29.275 --> 02:02:31.844
SAID THAN DONE I KNOW YOU KNOW

02:02:31.911 --> 02:02:33.779
CINEMA COUNTY AND NAPA COUNTY

02:02:33.846 --> 02:02:34.847
YEAH YOU HAVE THERE'S A LITTLE

02:02:34.914 --> 02:02:36.582
BIT OF A OF A CONFLICT YOU KNOW

02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:38.084
YOU WANT TO HELP PEOPLE REBUILD

02:02:38.150 --> 02:02:39.285
BUT YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:02:39.351 --> 02:02:41.053
THAT THEY BUILD SAFE AND SO

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:42.288
BUT THEY DO SO WE DO NEED TO

02:02:42.354 --> 02:02:43.456
ENFORCE OUR BUILDING BECAUSE

02:02:43.522 --> 02:02:44.924
I YOU KNOW LIMIT DEVELOPMENT

02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:47.593
IN STE NEW CONSTRUCTION IN

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:49.128
SENSITIVE AREAS I MEAN I THINK

02:02:49.195 --> 02:02:50.496
TO A DEGREE THE INSURANCE

02:02:50.563 --> 02:02:53.599
MARKET DOES -- DOES HELP BY YOU

02:02:53.666 --> 02:02:55.801
KNOW BY APPROPRIATELY -- AND

02:02:55.868 --> 02:02:57.203
CHARGING FOR YOU KNOW PEOPLE

02:02:57.269 --> 02:02:58.104
WHO ARE BUILDING A HIGHER RISK

02:02:58.170 --> 02:02:59.138
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:02:59.205 --> 02:03:00.873
THEY'RE NOT THAT THEY'RE DOING

02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:02.742
IT FAIRLY BUT WE DO HAVE A

02:03:02.808 --> 02:03:05.277
PRETTY HARDY REGULATORY REGIME

02:03:05.344 --> 02:03:06.479
INSURERS CAN COME IN ANYTIME

02:03:06.545 --> 02:03:07.747
THEY WANT FOR A RATE INCREASE

02:03:07.813 --> 02:03:09.715
REQUEST SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU

02:03:09.782 --> 02:03:12.084
KNOW THERE'S SOME CAP THERE --

02:03:12.151 --> 02:03:15.287
AT THE TWO THE TWO ISSUES THAT

02:03:15.354 --> 02:03:16.822
I KNOW WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE

02:03:16.889 --> 02:03:19.558
COOPERATION FROM FROM INSURERS

02:03:19.625 --> 02:03:22.294
ON -- ALIY IN THIS AREA JUST

02:03:22.361 --> 02:03:24.563
LIVING EXPENSE A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:03:24.630 --> 02:03:27.199
-- ARE ARE ARE VERY NERVOUS

02:03:27.266 --> 02:03:28.667
THAT THEY'RE NOT THAT NEW EVEN

02:03:28.734 --> 02:03:30.336
THEIR TWENTY FOUR MONTHS --

02:03:30.402 --> 02:03:31.837
ISN'T GONNA GET TO GET THEM

02:03:31.904 --> 02:03:32.505
THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

02:03:32.571 --> 02:03:34.607
BE BACK HOME -- AND I AND I

02:03:34.673 --> 02:03:36.008
THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE AGAIN

02:03:36.075 --> 02:03:37.176
WE'RE GONNA CALL ON INSURERS TO

02:03:37.243 --> 02:03:39.044
WORK WITH THEIR THEIR CUSTOMERS

02:03:39.111 --> 02:03:40.813
AND YOU KNOW JUST JUST TO JUST

02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:42.782
TO REFUTE YOU KNOW REX'S AYE

02:03:42.848 --> 02:03:44.850
IT'S A CASUAL IDEA THAT YOU

02:03:44.917 --> 02:03:45.818
KNOW YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF

02:03:45.885 --> 02:03:47.720
PROOF THAT YOU WERE MISLED AND

02:03:47.787 --> 02:03:49.522

02:03:49.588 --> 02:03:50.956
IS NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL YOU

02:03:51.023 --> 02:03:52.691
KNOW PEOPLE WHO PEOPLE HAVE

02:03:52.758 --> 02:03:53.926
TO GET EVIDENCE THAT THERE

02:03:53.993 --> 02:03:55.127
WAS THIS COMMUNICATION OF

02:03:55.194 --> 02:03:56.996
PEOPLE HARDLY EVER DO SO THE

02:03:57.062 --> 02:03:58.497
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY

02:03:58.564 --> 02:04:00.366
GET THEIR POLICIES REFORM TO

02:04:00.432 --> 02:04:01.400
BE WHERE THEY WE SHOULD HAVE

02:04:01.467 --> 02:04:03.402
BEEN THERE A VERY SMALL SET

02:04:03.469 --> 02:04:05.070
SUBSET OF PEOPLE WHO ROCKY

02:04:05.137 --> 02:04:07.673
LESLIE SAVE THESE TAX IN THESE

02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:09.542
LETTERS MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:04:09.608 --> 02:04:11.010
IN THE HE SAID SHE SAID AND

02:04:11.076 --> 02:04:12.912
I WANT TO SPONSORS AND LARA

02:04:12.978 --> 02:04:15.181
QUESTION SURE SURE I'M SO YEAH

02:04:15.247 --> 02:04:17.383
JUST SO EXTENDING A LEAVE FOR

02:04:17.449 --> 02:04:18.851
ANOTHER SIX MONTHS IF PEOPLE

02:04:18.918 --> 02:04:20.286
CAN SHOW THAT THEY USE DEL

02:04:20.352 --> 02:04:21.554
DUE DILIGENCE AND COULDN'T GET

02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:23.422
BACK IN AND THEN WE STILL HAVE

02:04:23.489 --> 02:04:24.590
A BIG ISSUE COMING DOWN THE

02:04:24.657 --> 02:04:25.858
PIKE WITH THE DEBRIS REMOVAL

02:04:25.925 --> 02:04:31.230
BILLS OKAY MISTER FRAZIER

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:33.532
CENTER LARA'S HERE RETROACTIVE

02:04:33.599 --> 02:04:35.234
IMPACT WE SAW A LOT OF THOSE

02:04:35.301 --> 02:04:38.103
BILLS THIS YEAR -- WE CERTAINLY

02:04:38.170 --> 02:04:40.239
BELIEVE THAT PRICES ARE BASED

02:04:40.306 --> 02:04:41.607
ON WHAT THE LAW IS THAT THE

02:04:41.674 --> 02:04:43.409
TIME YOU MAKE YOUR RATE FILING

02:04:43.475 --> 02:04:45.544
AND WHEN THE LEGISLATURE

02:04:45.611 --> 02:04:47.346
CHANGES THE RULES TO LET'S

02:04:47.413 --> 02:04:50.015
SAY ADD ADDITIONAL POLICY --

02:04:50.082 --> 02:04:51.951
EXPENSES THAT WE WOULD PAY --

02:04:52.017 --> 02:04:54.053
AT THAT POINT ONCE WE REFLECT

02:04:54.119 --> 02:04:55.221
THOSE THEN WILL COME TO THE

02:04:55.287 --> 02:04:56.488
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ASK

02:04:56.555 --> 02:04:57.723
FOR RATE INCREASES TO COVER

02:04:57.790 --> 02:05:00.526
THOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS -- BUT

02:05:00.593 --> 02:05:01.627
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET

02:05:01.694 --> 02:05:02.728
COMFORTABLE WITH THE NOTION

02:05:02.795 --> 02:05:03.829
THAT WHEN OUR RATES ARE BUILT

02:05:03.896 --> 02:05:05.297
ON A CERTAIN BODY OF LAW THAT

02:05:05.364 --> 02:05:06.532
THE LEGISLATURE WOULD COME

02:05:06.599 --> 02:05:09.068
ALONG AND THEN RETROACTIVELY

02:05:09.134 --> 02:05:11.170
CHANGE THE LAW TO ADD ADD

02:05:11.237 --> 02:05:13.105
ADD COSTS WITHOUT THAT BEING

02:05:13.172 --> 02:05:14.974
INCLUDED IN THE RATE FILINGS

02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:17.977
AS TO UNDERWRITING UNDERWRITING

02:05:18.043 --> 02:05:20.779
IS REALLY A TOOL THAT INSURERS

02:05:20.846 --> 02:05:22.615
MUST USE WHEN THEY ARE NOT

02:05:22.681 --> 02:05:25.251
ABLE TO GET ADEQUATE RATE

02:05:25.317 --> 02:05:28.153
WHEN -- WHEN A A RATE -- PLAN

02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:29.288
APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:05:29.355 --> 02:05:30.723
INSURANCE IN A CERTAIN AREA

02:05:30.789 --> 02:05:32.758
LET'S SAY -- WOULDN'T ALLOW

02:05:32.825 --> 02:05:33.926
THE INSURANCE COMPANY TO

02:05:33.993 --> 02:05:35.861
GET ADEQUATE PRICE YOU CAN'T

02:05:35.928 --> 02:05:37.963
CONTINUE JUST TO OPERATE AS

02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:39.531
BUSINESS AS USUAL SO YOU START

02:05:39.598 --> 02:05:42.101
USING -- UNDERWRITING TOOLS

02:05:42.167 --> 02:05:43.969
-- TO DENY APPLICATIONS OR

02:05:44.036 --> 02:05:46.171
POSSIBLY NON RENEW TO MAKE SURE

02:05:46.238 --> 02:05:47.940
THAT THE RICH THAT THAT LOWER

02:05:48.007 --> 02:05:49.608
RISK MATCHES THE INADEQUATE

02:05:49.675 --> 02:05:51.110
PRICING OF THE AREA THAT'S THE

02:05:51.176 --> 02:05:53.879
STRUGGLE -- THAT THAT COMPANIES

02:05:53.946 --> 02:05:55.414
FACE AND OBVIOUSLY WITH RATE

02:05:55.481 --> 02:05:57.449
ADEQUACY IT'S A LOT EASIER

02:05:57.516 --> 02:05:58.884
TO WRITE IN EVERY COMMUNITY

02:05:58.951 --> 02:05:59.652
WHERE THE ONLY THING YOU'RE

02:05:59.718 --> 02:06:00.653
MANAGING AT THAT POINT IS

02:06:00.719 --> 02:06:03.489
GEOGRAPHIC OVER CONCENTRATION

02:06:03.555 --> 02:06:05.591
CENTER LARA YOU GET THANKS

02:06:05.658 --> 02:06:06.859
FOR THOSE GOOD QUESTIONS THAT

02:06:06.926 --> 02:06:08.961
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON THANK

02:06:09.028 --> 02:06:11.330
YOU SENATOR AND CHAIR I -- AND

02:06:11.397 --> 02:06:13.165
I UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE AND

02:06:13.232 --> 02:06:14.533
HAVE FOR THIS HEARING AND AND

02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:16.535
WHILE WE'RE HERE -- HOWEVER

02:06:16.602 --> 02:06:19.038
-- JUST JUST AS A REMINDER

02:06:19.104 --> 02:06:20.873
THE WILD FIRES THAT WE HAVE

02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:22.374
CAN'T BE SILENT INTO JUST A

02:06:22.441 --> 02:06:24.310
CONFLICT BETWEEN HOMEOWNERS

02:06:24.376 --> 02:06:27.012
AND POLICY OF PROVIDERS THERE

02:06:27.079 --> 02:06:28.213
ARE SO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT

02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:29.915
WE NEED TO DO ON A STATE LEVEL

02:06:29.982 --> 02:06:31.317
WITH FIRE MANAGEMENT AS FAR

02:06:31.383 --> 02:06:32.985
AS FORCED -- MANAGEMENT AND

02:06:33.052 --> 02:06:34.453
LAND MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS THE

02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:36.388
LOCAL POLICIES SO I DON'T NEED

02:06:36.455 --> 02:06:37.456
AN ANSWER TODAY WHAT I WILL

02:06:37.523 --> 02:06:38.958
DO IS THROW THIS OUT CHAU AND

02:06:39.024 --> 02:06:40.726
SHARE WITH YOU THE INTEREST

02:06:40.793 --> 02:06:42.328
THAT I HAVE IN MY OFFICE WHAT

02:06:42.394 --> 02:06:44.363
WILL BE PURSUING AND WHAT WAS

02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:45.965
MENTIONED BY MISBACH WAS THAT

02:06:46.031 --> 02:06:47.299
WE HAVE THE LAWS WERE JUST NOT

02:06:47.366 --> 02:06:49.935
ENFORCING THEM AND -- THE SOME

02:06:50.002 --> 02:06:50.602
OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HAD

02:06:50.669 --> 02:06:52.137
MENTIONED ABOUT WHEN WE HAD

02:06:52.204 --> 02:06:53.639
THE DISASTER YOU AT A TABLE

02:06:53.706 --> 02:06:55.941
OUT THERE -- THAT'S GREAT AND

02:06:56.008 --> 02:06:57.443
THAT'S FANTASTIC BUT NOT ALL

02:06:57.509 --> 02:06:58.477
THE VICTIMS COULD MAKE IT TO

02:06:58.544 --> 02:07:00.446
YOUR TABLE AND SO I THINK THE

02:07:00.512 --> 02:07:01.714
ONE THING I'M REALLY INTERESTED

02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:03.349
IN IS MAKING SURE THAT PRIOR

02:07:03.415 --> 02:07:06.118
TO A DISASTER -- POLICY HOLDERS

02:07:06.185 --> 02:07:07.453
PROPERTY OWNERS ARE AWARE

02:07:07.519 --> 02:07:09.221
OF THEIR RIGHTS AND THEY ARE

02:07:09.288 --> 02:07:11.457
AWARE OF RESOURCES THAT ARE

02:07:11.523 --> 02:07:13.092
AVAILABLE FOR THEM WHETHER IT

02:07:13.158 --> 02:07:14.960
BE FEMUR ANYTHING ELSE PRIOR

02:07:15.027 --> 02:07:16.395
TO RATHER THAN WAITING TILL

02:07:16.462 --> 02:07:18.464
AFTER THE DISASTER AND THINGS

02:07:18.530 --> 02:07:20.599
ARE A BIT AWRY THE OTHER THING

02:07:20.666 --> 02:07:22.167
I'M REALLY REALLY FOCUSED AND

02:07:22.234 --> 02:07:23.769
INTERESTED IN AND POSSIBLY

02:07:23.836 --> 02:07:24.870
IF YOU DID WANT TO RESPOND

YEARS AGO WE HAD A MASSIVE

02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:18.016
FLOOD AND MASSIVE DAMAGE AND

02:09:18.083 --> 02:09:19.451
THE SENSE THAT TIME THERE HAS

02:09:19.518 --> 02:09:21.053
BEEN LEGISLATION THAT HAS BEEN

02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:23.388
VERY CONTROVERSY I'LL BUT IT

02:09:23.455 --> 02:09:25.157
SET UP NEW STANDARDS FOR TWO

02:09:25.224 --> 02:09:27.659
HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD PLAIN AREAS

02:09:27.726 --> 02:09:30.295
WHERE BY ANY BUILDER GOING

02:09:30.362 --> 02:09:32.064
INTO AN AREA INTO ONE OF THOSE

02:09:32.131 --> 02:09:34.600
DESIGNATED AREAS MUST MEETS

02:09:34.666 --> 02:09:37.236
CERTAIN HIGHER STANDARDS --

02:09:37.302 --> 02:09:39.138
BEFORE THEY CAN GET APPROVED

02:09:39.204 --> 02:09:40.539
TO BE ABLE TO BUILD AND THERE'S

02:09:40.606 --> 02:09:42.007
A TIME LINE THAT'S ATTACHED

02:09:42.074 --> 02:09:43.675
WITH THAT YOU MIGHT YOU MIGHT

02:09:43.742 --> 02:09:45.310
REMEMBER IT WAS SB FIVE BY

02:09:45.377 --> 02:09:47.746
SENATOR MACHADO AM AND AGAIN

02:09:47.813 --> 02:09:49.148
IT'S BEEN CONTROVERSY BECAUSE

02:09:49.214 --> 02:09:50.983
THERE BEEN SOME SOME PROBLEMS

02:09:51.049 --> 02:09:52.651
WITH IT IT GETS DIFFICULT WHEN

02:09:52.718 --> 02:09:53.852
YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL PROPERTY

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:55.521
OWNERS WHAT THEY CAN DO AND

02:09:55.587 --> 02:09:57.089
CAN'T DO WITH THEIR PROPERTY

02:09:57.156 --> 02:10:00.159
BUT CAO FIRED DOES KEEP --

02:10:00.225 --> 02:10:02.327
MAPS OF THEIRS THEY CALL THEM

02:10:02.394 --> 02:10:03.662
THEIR STATE RESPONSIBILITY

02:10:03.729 --> 02:10:04.630
AREAS THERE AS R.

02:10:04.696 --> 02:10:07.032
A.'S OF THE VERY HIGH RISK

02:10:07.099 --> 02:10:11.436
-- FIRE AREAS AND I KNOW THAT

02:10:11.503 --> 02:10:13.972
WITH THE THE CONSTITUENTS IN

02:10:14.039 --> 02:10:16.375
MY DISTRICT -- THEY DIDN'T

02:10:16.441 --> 02:10:17.943
SET OUT TO INTENTIONALLY BY

02:10:18.010 --> 02:10:20.312
HOME IN A FLOOD PLAIN -- THEY

02:10:20.379 --> 02:10:22.714
TRUSTED OTHERS WHO ENCOURAGED

02:10:22.781 --> 02:10:24.249
THEM TO BUY WHETHER IT'S THAT

02:10:24.316 --> 02:10:26.685
THE THE BUILDER THE -- REAL

02:10:26.752 --> 02:10:28.854
ESTATE AGENTS TO ENSURE WHOEVER

02:10:28.921 --> 02:10:30.789
WOULD BE THEY JUST TRUSTED THAT

02:10:30.856 --> 02:10:32.391
WELL THIS IS ON THE MARKET AND

02:10:32.457 --> 02:10:33.559
AND I'M GONNA BUY THIS HOME

02:10:33.625 --> 02:10:36.662
BECAUSE I WANTED -- I'M JUST

02:10:36.728 --> 02:10:37.930
WONDERING IF THERE'S BEEN ANY

02:10:37.996 --> 02:10:40.132
THOUGHT TO HAVING DISCUSSION

02:10:40.199 --> 02:10:42.868
AMONG THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY

02:10:42.935 --> 02:10:45.637
THE BUILDING INDUSTRY MORTGAGE

02:10:45.704 --> 02:10:49.208
INDUSTRY ABOUT TAKING A LOOK AT

02:10:49.274 --> 02:10:51.043
THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS

02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:52.644
AND REALLY LOOKING AT YOU KNOW

02:10:52.711 --> 02:10:54.580
DO WE NEED TO SET UP SOME SOME

02:10:54.646 --> 02:10:57.216
REQUIREMENTS SIMILAR TO WHAT'S

02:10:57.282 --> 02:10:58.884
BEEN DEAD FOR DONE FOR FLOOD

02:10:58.951 --> 02:11:01.053
AREAS THAT ACTUALLY FEMALE WAS

02:11:01.119 --> 02:11:02.621
INVOLVED WITH AS WELL AS AT A

02:11:02.688 --> 02:11:04.890
CONVERSATION IT'S BEEN STARTED

02:11:04.957 --> 02:11:08.060
OR THOUGHT ABOUT I'M I'M NOT

02:11:08.126 --> 02:11:09.828
A AWARE OF THAT WHERE THERE

02:11:09.895 --> 02:11:13.599
WOULD BE TO SIGN UNDERSTAND

02:11:13.665 --> 02:11:15.167
YEAH -- THAT THERE WOULD BE

02:11:15.234 --> 02:11:16.768
SOME ENFORCER WEATHER WOULD

02:11:16.835 --> 02:11:18.971
BE I GUESS SOME STATE AGENCY

02:11:19.037 --> 02:11:20.839
THAT WOULD THAT WOULD MANDATE

02:11:20.906 --> 02:11:22.107
THE PURCHASE OF INSURANCE FOR

02:11:22.174 --> 02:11:23.875
CERTAIN FOLKS IS THAT IS THAT

02:11:23.942 --> 02:11:25.611
THE BECAUSE CERTAINLY IN LAKE

02:11:25.677 --> 02:11:27.346
COUNTY THAT WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE

02:11:27.412 --> 02:11:28.247
WHERE THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS

02:11:28.313 --> 02:11:30.148
WHO THEY INHERITED THEIR HOMES

02:11:30.215 --> 02:11:31.216
THEY WERE PAID OFF THERE'S NO

02:11:31.283 --> 02:11:33.118
BANK THEY'RE REQUIRING A NOTE

02:11:33.185 --> 02:11:34.052
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE A

02:11:34.119 --> 02:11:36.121
TREMENDOUS -- TO WAY TOO MANY

02:11:36.188 --> 02:11:37.522
FOLKS WHO JUST COMPLETELY LOST

02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:40.759
THEIR HOME INSURANCE WE I MAYBE

02:11:40.826 --> 02:11:43.362
I UNDERSTOOD IT TO ASK ABOUT

02:11:43.428 --> 02:11:44.529
AN EQUIVALENT OF THE FLOOD

02:11:44.596 --> 02:11:46.131
MAPPING PROGRAM FOR FIRE RISK

02:11:46.198 --> 02:11:48.000
OKAY AND SO IF YOU DON'T MIND

02:11:48.066 --> 02:11:50.469
I I I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT

02:11:50.535 --> 02:11:52.504
WE DO HAVE IN FACT WHEN I I HAD

02:11:52.571 --> 02:11:55.140
A NOTE HERE TO ASK LLOYD AND

02:11:55.207 --> 02:11:56.375
A YOU KNOW IS THERE A UNIFORM

02:11:56.441 --> 02:11:57.809
STANDARD FOR HIGH RISK I THINK

02:11:57.876 --> 02:11:59.878
-- A CENTER LARA ACTUALLY

02:11:59.945 --> 02:12:01.580
ASKED FOR THE SAME QUESTION

02:12:01.647 --> 02:12:02.681
AND I JUST WANT TO THE POINT OF

02:12:02.748 --> 02:12:05.384
INFORMATION TO SHARE IF THE IF

02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:06.518
IF ALL OF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS

02:12:06.585 --> 02:12:08.353
BUT THE GOVERNOR CREATE A TASK

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:09.855
TASK FORCE ON TREE MORTALITY

02:12:09.921 --> 02:12:11.623
A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO RIGHT

02:12:11.690 --> 02:12:13.325
AND THEY WERE LOOKING AT WHAT

02:12:13.392 --> 02:12:14.359
WE GONNA DO WITH THE HUNDRED

02:12:14.426 --> 02:12:15.427
MILLION DEAD TREES FROM THE

02:12:15.494 --> 02:12:17.029
BARK BEETLE INFESTATION BUT

02:12:17.095 --> 02:12:19.431
THEN IT THEN A THEN BECAUSE

02:12:19.498 --> 02:12:21.667
IN A LOT OF THESE AREAS THE

02:12:21.733 --> 02:12:23.068
INSURANCE MARKET WAS CHANGING

02:12:23.135 --> 02:12:24.336
AND PEOPLE WERE GETTING ON

02:12:24.403 --> 02:12:25.904
RENEWED ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES

02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:28.607
-- ACTUALLY HOT NOT RENEWED --

02:12:28.674 --> 02:12:30.909
AND AND SO THERE AN INSURANCE

02:12:30.976 --> 02:12:33.745
SUB GROUP -- GREW OUT OF THE

02:12:33.812 --> 02:12:35.681
TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE IT'S

02:12:35.747 --> 02:12:37.616
KIND OF -- I REALLY MORE OF

02:12:37.683 --> 02:12:38.583
ONE BUT IT'S IT'S SORT OF ON

02:12:38.650 --> 02:12:40.218
HOLD RIGHT NOW AND I JUST SPOKE

02:12:40.285 --> 02:12:42.154
TO A SUPERVISOR DOWN AMERICA

02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:43.822
COUNTY ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD

02:12:43.889 --> 02:12:45.057
TRY TO RENEW IT BECAUSE THE

02:12:45.123 --> 02:12:47.159
FOCUS THERE WAS WOULDN'T BE

02:12:47.225 --> 02:12:49.394
GREAT IN TERMS OF OF DEVELOPING

02:12:49.461 --> 02:12:51.830
MITIGATION STANDARDS DISCOUNT

02:12:51.897 --> 02:12:54.366
SUPPORT -- AND BEST PRACTICES

02:12:54.433 --> 02:12:55.801
WITH WITH FORESTRY MANAGER

02:12:55.867 --> 02:12:57.469
AND ALL THAT THAT WE THAT

02:12:57.536 --> 02:12:59.204
WE CONTINUE THIS WORK WITH

02:12:59.271 --> 02:13:01.540
INSURERS WITH STAKEHOLDERS WITH

02:13:01.606 --> 02:13:02.874
CAL FIRE BECAUSE THERE REALLY

02:13:02.941 --> 02:13:04.576
ISN'T A STANDARD THERE'S I

02:13:04.643 --> 02:13:06.445
DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S A HIGH

02:13:06.511 --> 02:13:08.847
RISK -- CLASSIFICATION THAT

02:13:08.914 --> 02:13:10.248
EVERYONE WOULD AGREE WITH I

02:13:10.315 --> 02:13:11.416
THINK THE IN THE INSURANCE

02:13:11.483 --> 02:13:12.384
PROBABLY A LOT OF THEM USE

02:13:12.451 --> 02:13:15.354
THEIR OWN WAY OF DEFINING AND

02:13:15.420 --> 02:13:17.856
I KNOW THAT -- THAT THERE'S

02:13:17.923 --> 02:13:19.691
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO

02:13:19.758 --> 02:13:22.060
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S EFFECTIVE IN

02:13:22.127 --> 02:13:23.929
SAVING HOMES IN THE AFTERMATH

02:13:23.995 --> 02:13:25.764
OF A WILDFIRE COMPARED TO FLOOD

02:13:25.831 --> 02:13:27.399
WE HAVE A LOT MORE THERE'S A

02:13:27.466 --> 02:13:28.567
LOT MORE STRATEGIES YOU CAN

02:13:28.633 --> 02:13:30.569
USE THAT WE KNOW WORK YOU KNOW

02:13:30.635 --> 02:13:32.204
WITH WILDFIRE WE STILL HAVE

02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:34.539
YOU KNOW THE THE -- SCREENS

02:13:34.606 --> 02:13:35.741
TO KEEP EMBERS WERE FLYING

02:13:35.807 --> 02:13:37.209
BACK AND YOU CAN DO THAT ROOF

02:13:37.275 --> 02:13:40.779
VENT -- SCREENS YOU'VE GOT THE

02:13:40.846 --> 02:13:42.814
THE PHONE AND THAT OF COURSE

02:13:42.881 --> 02:13:44.216
REPLACING RUSE BUT THEY'RE

02:13:44.282 --> 02:13:46.218
STILL -- YOU KNOW WE STILL

02:13:46.284 --> 02:13:47.619
HAVE SOME WORK TO DO -- BUT I

02:13:47.686 --> 02:13:49.521
THINK TRYING TO GET SOME CLEAR

02:13:49.588 --> 02:13:50.589
STANDARDS I THINK A MAPPING

02:13:50.655 --> 02:13:52.357
IDEAS GREAT -- IF YOU CAN

02:13:52.424 --> 02:13:53.158
FIGURE OUT WHO'S GOING TO PAY

02:13:53.225 --> 02:13:54.559
FOR IT AND DO IT THERE THERE

02:13:54.626 --> 02:13:56.194
ARE THERE ARE MAPS THAT ARE OUT

02:13:56.261 --> 02:13:57.729
THERE THE CPC'S BEEN WORKING

02:13:57.796 --> 02:13:58.964
FOR I I BELIEVE THE LAST TEN

02:13:59.030 --> 02:14:01.266
YEARS ON UPDATING THEIR MAPS

02:14:01.333 --> 02:14:02.601
CAL FIRE HAS BEEN INTIMATELY

02:14:02.667 --> 02:14:04.369
INVOLVED IN THAT I THINK THE

02:14:04.436 --> 02:14:06.004
CRITICISM YOU'LL HEAR OF OF THE

02:14:06.071 --> 02:14:07.773
EXISTING A HIGH FIRE SEVERITY

02:14:07.839 --> 02:14:10.108
MAPS IS THAT LACKS NGUYEN DATA

02:14:10.175 --> 02:14:12.377
-- WHICH HAS BEEN TERRIBLY A

02:14:12.444 --> 02:14:13.245
JUST THERE'S NEVER BEEN THE

02:14:13.311 --> 02:14:14.679
COMPUTING POWER IN ORDER TO

A PART OF OUR LAW AND THEN

02:15:47.038 --> 02:15:49.074
RELATED TO THE BILL OF RIGHTS

ANY UPDATED COMMENTS ON THOSE

02:15:53.445 --> 02:15:55.680
MY ONLY COMMENT ON THAT IS I

02:15:55.747 --> 02:15:56.882
JUST DON'T THINK PEOPLE READING

02:15:56.948 --> 02:15:58.884

LOST HOMES OR HAVE SMOKE DAMAGE

02:16:01.786 --> 02:16:03.555

02:16:05.457 --> 02:16:08.226
WHAT THEIR COVERAGE WAS SO --

02:16:08.293 --> 02:16:09.394
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THESE THINGS

02:16:09.461 --> 02:16:11.363
BUT IF IF IT'S NOT -- IF PEOPLE

02:16:11.429 --> 02:16:13.732
ARE TAKING THE INITIATIVE TO

02:16:13.798 --> 02:16:15.534
TO READ WHAT THEY'RE BUYING

02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:17.402
AND -- AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

02:16:17.469 --> 02:16:22.407
IT -- THAT THAT STUFF FOR

02:16:22.474 --> 02:16:24.109
TO ADD TO THAT I THINK -- YOU

02:16:24.175 --> 02:16:26.077
KNOW I'M A LAWYER I SO I YOU

02:16:26.144 --> 02:16:27.746
KNOW I'VE I'VE LOOKED AT THE

02:16:27.812 --> 02:16:28.647
HISTORY OF THE LAW AND YOU

02:16:28.713 --> 02:16:30.315
GAVE SOME GOOD OUT OF IN THE

02:16:30.382 --> 02:16:31.182
BACKGROUND MATERIALS FOR THE

02:16:31.249 --> 02:16:33.018
HEARING OF OF THE EVERY CASE

02:16:33.084 --> 02:16:35.554
AND WHICH BASICALLY HAS HAS

02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:38.857
BEEN IN MY OPINION LOOKING AT

02:16:38.924 --> 02:16:40.592
THIS FOR A LONG TIME I THINK

02:16:40.659 --> 02:16:44.062
THE FACT THAT ULTIMATELY -- THE

02:16:44.129 --> 02:16:46.698
INSURER AND ITS PRODUCER OR DO

02:16:46.765 --> 02:16:49.734
NOT HAVE A -- AS A TO A DUTY TO

02:16:49.801 --> 02:16:51.202
ADEQUATELY ENSURE AT LEAST THE

02:16:51.269 --> 02:16:53.972
COURTS HAVE NOT WANTED TO HIM

02:16:54.039 --> 02:16:57.409
THAT ON THE SELLER TO SAY OKAY

02:16:57.475 --> 02:16:58.877
IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO SELL

02:16:58.944 --> 02:16:59.945
SOMEBODY INSURANCE YOU GOT TO

02:17:00.011 --> 02:17:01.980
SELL THEM INSURANCES TAILORED

02:17:02.047 --> 02:17:03.381
FOR THEIR PROPERTY THE COURTS

02:17:03.448 --> 02:17:05.050
HAVE NOT WANTED TO GO THERE

02:17:05.116 --> 02:17:06.384
BUT I HONESTLY THINK THAT THE

02:17:06.451 --> 02:17:08.420
FACT THAT THAT THAT THAT THEY

02:17:08.486 --> 02:17:10.055
HAVEN'T GONE THERE IS WHY THE

02:17:10.121 --> 02:17:11.156
PROBLEM KEEPS GOING BECAUSE

02:17:11.222 --> 02:17:12.424
I THINK AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT

02:17:12.490 --> 02:17:14.960
THIS COMPETITION AND YOU KNOW

02:17:15.026 --> 02:17:16.861
BETWEEN CARRIERS ARE GONNA YOU

02:17:16.928 --> 02:17:18.663
KNOW YOU AND AND BECAUSE TOTAL

02:17:18.730 --> 02:17:20.599
LOSSES ARE RARE AS LONG AS THE

02:17:20.665 --> 02:17:22.400
CARRIER AND ITS AGENTS KNOW

02:17:22.467 --> 02:17:23.535
THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE

02:17:23.602 --> 02:17:24.903
HELD LIABLE UNLESS THE PERSON

02:17:24.970 --> 02:17:26.938
HAS THIS INCREDIBLE QUANTUM

02:17:27.005 --> 02:17:28.239
OF PROOF WHICH HARDLY ANYONE

02:17:28.306 --> 02:17:31.343
HAS THAT THEY WERE MISINFORMED

02:17:31.409 --> 02:17:33.144
MOST OF THE TIME THE CUSTOMER

02:17:33.211 --> 02:17:35.580
LOSES SO I THINK THAT IS A

02:17:35.647 --> 02:17:37.115
REALITY I KNOW THIS BODY IS

02:17:37.182 --> 02:17:38.883
NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT CREATING

02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:40.485
A NEW CAUSE OF ACTION BUT I

02:17:40.552 --> 02:17:42.454

HEARING THOSE STORIES FOR A

02:27:33.878 --> 02:27:36.113
FEW YEARS NOW AND WE REALIZE

02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:37.982
THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE

02:27:38.049 --> 02:27:39.350
WE'VE BEEN SPENDING THE LAST

02:27:39.417 --> 02:27:41.052
FEW YEARS IN CONVERSATIONS

02:27:41.118 --> 02:27:42.920
WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY --

02:27:42.987 --> 02:27:44.522
BOTH INDEPENDENTLY AND THROUGH

02:27:44.589 --> 02:27:46.224
THE STATE'S TRIMMER TALLY TASK

02:27:46.290 --> 02:27:49.360

MEMBER COUNTIES WE ARE TRYING

02:27:51.696 --> 02:27:53.331
TO GEAR UP TO CONTINUE THOSE

02:27:53.397 --> 02:27:54.732
DISCUSSIONS THROUGH THE NEWLY

02:27:54.799 --> 02:27:56.300
FORMED FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK

02:27:56.367 --> 02:27:58.369
FORCE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

02:27:58.436 --> 02:27:59.470
HAVE UNFORTUNATELY NOT BEEN

02:27:59.537 --> 02:28:00.905
AS PRODUCTIVE AS WE WOULD

02:28:00.972 --> 02:28:02.873
LIKE WE HOPE TO MAKE THEM MORE

02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:04.542
PRODUCTIVE SO WE CAN HOPEFULLY

02:28:04.609 --> 02:28:05.776
TACKLE SOME OF THESE ISSUES

02:28:05.843 --> 02:28:07.912
WITHOUT HAVING TO CONSTANTLY

02:28:07.979 --> 02:28:09.947
GO BACK TO LEGISLATION BUT WE

02:28:10.014 --> 02:28:11.415
APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF YOUR

02:28:11.482 --> 02:28:13.084
TO COMMITTEES AND HOPEFULLY WE

02:28:13.150 --> 02:28:14.151
CAN CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH

02:28:14.218 --> 02:28:15.686
SOME OF THESE ISSUES SO THAT

02:28:15.753 --> 02:28:18.456
MY BOARDS CONSTITUENTS CAN

02:28:18.522 --> 02:28:20.291
IMPROVE THEIR COVERAGE REBUILD

02:28:20.358 --> 02:28:21.993
THEIR HOMES AND THOSE THAT ARE

02:28:22.059 --> 02:28:23.594
STILL LIVING OUT IN HIGH FIRE

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:24.996
RISK AREAS WHICH AS WE KNOW

02:28:25.062 --> 02:28:28.132
IS A GREATER AREA OF THE STATE

02:28:28.199 --> 02:28:30.368
EVERY YEAR CAN CONTINUE TO

02:28:30.434 --> 02:28:31.836
IMPROVE THEIR COVERAGE OPTIONS

02:28:31.902 --> 02:28:36.774
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

02:28:36.841 --> 02:28:38.009
HI EVERYONE MY NAME THIRTY FELL

CAM INSURANCE BROKER BUT IN THE

02:28:39.577 --> 02:28:40.611
BUSINESS ALMOST THIRTY YEARS

02:28:40.678 --> 02:28:43.581
HOW YOU DOING -- I'VE HEARD

02:28:43.648 --> 02:28:44.682
QUESTIONS AND I JUST WANTED

02:28:44.749 --> 02:28:46.517
TO GIVE YOU MY OPINION AND MY

02:28:46.584 --> 02:28:48.085
BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AS AN

02:28:48.152 --> 02:28:49.487
INSURANCE AGENT I REPRESENT AS

02:28:49.553 --> 02:28:50.988
A BROKER REPRESENT BOTH SIDES

02:28:51.055 --> 02:28:52.123
ARE REPRESENT THE CONSUMER

02:28:52.189 --> 02:28:53.824
AND I REPRESENT THE COMPANY TO

02:28:53.891 --> 02:28:54.892
ALWAYS SIT IN THE MIDDLE AND

02:28:54.959 --> 02:28:56.327
I DON'T LIKE CONSUMERS RIPPING

02:28:56.394 --> 02:28:57.561
OUT THE COMPANY AS MUCH AS I

02:28:57.628 --> 02:28:58.663
WOULD LIKE COMPANIES RIPPING

02:28:58.729 --> 02:29:00.564
OFF THE CONSUMER AND IT'S MY

02:29:00.631 --> 02:29:02.033
JOB TO DO MY BEST TO FIGHT FOR

02:29:02.099 --> 02:29:03.134
EITHER THE PARTY'S DEPENDING

02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:05.303
WHO I FEEL IS THE RIGHT DOING

02:29:05.369 --> 02:29:07.471
THE RIGHT THING SO THE THING I

02:29:07.538 --> 02:29:09.140
WANT TO SAY IS WHAT CHANGES CAN

02:29:09.206 --> 02:29:11.175
YOU GUYS DO LEGISLATIVELY ONE

02:29:11.242 --> 02:29:12.276
OF THE THINGS I WOULD CONSIDER

02:29:12.343 --> 02:29:13.544
FOR YOU GUYS TO MAYBE CONSIDER

02:29:13.611 --> 02:29:14.812
MAYBE EVEN WRITING DOWN BECAUSE

02:29:14.879 --> 02:29:15.613
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WAY

02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:17.181
I THINK YOU CAN MAKE A CHANGE

02:29:17.248 --> 02:29:19.150
IS NUMBER ONE YOU HEARD A GUY

02:29:19.216 --> 02:29:20.318
TESTIMONY TODAY THAT COULD

02:29:20.384 --> 02:29:21.519
CAUSE AN EXTRA HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:29:21.585 --> 02:29:22.787
DOLLARS WITH BUILDING CODE

02:29:22.853 --> 02:29:25.289
UPGRADES WELL MOST INSURANCE

02:29:25.356 --> 02:29:26.791
POLICIES HAVE A STANDARD FOR

02:29:26.857 --> 02:29:28.526
BACK UP TEN PERCENT IF YOU'RE

02:29:28.592 --> 02:29:29.493
SURE HOUSE FOR THREE HUNDRED

02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:30.528
THOUSAND A TEN PERCENT THAT'S

02:29:30.594 --> 02:29:31.595
THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT

02:29:31.662 --> 02:29:33.364
COMES WAY SHORT I THINK THE

02:29:33.431 --> 02:29:35.166
STANDARD DRAWBACKS A BABY BE

02:29:35.232 --> 02:29:36.967
TWENTY FIVE THIRTY PERCENT

02:29:37.034 --> 02:29:38.169
SO WE SHOULD CONSIDER HAVING

02:29:38.235 --> 02:29:39.337
MINIMUMS IT WHEN IT COMES TO

02:29:39.403 --> 02:29:40.771
BUILDING GOT CAUGHT UP GREAT

02:29:40.838 --> 02:29:41.806
SO WE CAN COVERED A HUNDRED

02:29:41.872 --> 02:29:43.140
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND MAKE IT

02:29:43.207 --> 02:29:45.242
A STANDARD PART OF A POLICY --

02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:46.844
IT'S GOING TO COST VERY LITTLE

02:29:46.911 --> 02:29:48.245
SECOND THING I WOULD LOOK AT

02:29:48.312 --> 02:29:49.580
IS I WILL LOOK AT POLICIES

02:29:49.647 --> 02:29:51.248
WE COMES TO LEADING COMPANIES

02:29:51.315 --> 02:29:52.316
THEN THE COMPANIES A LOT OF

02:29:52.383 --> 02:29:54.785
TIMES HE GAVE AN EXAMPLE GUIDES

02:29:54.852 --> 02:29:55.786
PAYING THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR

02:29:55.853 --> 02:29:56.887
FINE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

02:29:56.954 --> 02:29:58.889
A HOUSE ASKEW'S BEFORE PIECE

02:29:58.956 --> 02:29:59.924
OF PROPERTY BUT THE HOUSE IS

02:29:59.990 --> 02:30:01.759
WORTH EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:30:01.826 --> 02:30:03.194
YEAH THAT HAPPENS AND YES IT'S

02:30:03.260 --> 02:30:04.362
DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN TO AN

02:30:04.428 --> 02:30:06.764
INSURED THAT WE DON'T INSURE

02:30:06.831 --> 02:30:07.865
WHAT YOU BOUGHT THE HOUSE FOR

02:30:07.932 --> 02:30:09.100
WILSHIRE WOULD COST TO REBUILD

02:30:09.166 --> 02:30:10.601
THE HOUSE BUT A LOT OF TIMES

02:30:10.668 --> 02:30:11.969
THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE YOU COULD

02:30:12.036 --> 02:30:13.104
SPEND EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:30:13.170 --> 02:30:14.472
DOLLARS FOR A PIECE OF PROPERTY

02:30:14.538 --> 02:30:15.373
AND THE HOUSE IS ONLY WORTH

02:30:15.439 --> 02:30:16.307
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

02:30:16.374 --> 02:30:17.975
DOLLARS NOT TRY EXPLAINING THAT

02:30:18.042 --> 02:30:19.243
TO THE LENDER WHO WANTS IS TO

02:30:19.310 --> 02:30:21.545
COVER THE LOAN SO IT WORKS BOTH

02:30:21.612 --> 02:30:23.147
WAYS SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

02:30:23.214 --> 02:30:24.582
INDUSTRY LOOK AT THE LENDING

02:30:24.648 --> 02:30:25.783
INDUSTRY AS WELL BECAUSE THEY

02:30:25.850 --> 02:30:27.585
HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH HOW

02:30:27.651 --> 02:30:30.054
PEOPLE ARE SHORT ANOTHER THING

02:30:30.121 --> 02:30:32.656
THEY PROVIDE REPORTS TODAY WHEN

02:30:32.723 --> 02:30:33.557
YOU BUY A PIECE OF PROPERTY I

02:30:33.624 --> 02:30:34.725
THINK IT'S REQUIRED BY LAW IF

02:30:34.792 --> 02:30:35.760
YOU BUY A PIECE OF PROPERTY

02:30:35.826 --> 02:30:37.128
TO THE HOME THAT IF YOU'RE

02:30:37.194 --> 02:30:38.429
IN A FLOOD PLAIN YOU HAVE TO

02:30:38.496 --> 02:30:39.597
HAVE TO BE DISCLOSED THEIR

02:30:39.663 --> 02:30:41.165
DISCLOSURES AND I'M NOT TALKING

02:30:41.232 --> 02:30:42.199
ABOUT INSURANCE IS BECAUSE I

02:30:42.266 --> 02:30:46.904
KNOW YOU KEN COOLEY RIGHT BUT

02:30:46.971 --> 02:30:50.975
SEE WHY CAN'T THESE PEOPLE WHO

02:30:51.041 --> 02:30:54.612
REPORT THESE NOMINEES BASED

02:30:54.678 --> 02:30:56.981
ON WHERE YOUR HOME IS SAY HEY

02:30:57.047 --> 02:30:59.216
YOU'RE BUYING A HOME IN A FIRE

02:30:59.283 --> 02:31:01.552
HAZARD ZONE SO THAT PEOPLE WHO

02:31:01.619 --> 02:31:03.020
ARE BUYING THESE HOUSES CAN'T

02:31:03.087 --> 02:31:04.455
SEE LATER HEY I WAS UNDER SURE

02:31:04.522 --> 02:31:06.390
BECAUSE YOU KNEW THAT THAT'S

02:31:06.457 --> 02:31:07.191
WHAT YOU WERE GETTING YOU

02:31:07.258 --> 02:31:08.092
KNEW YOU WERE GETTING A HOUSE

02:31:08.159 --> 02:31:09.760
IN THE FOOT PAIN SO I THINK

02:31:09.827 --> 02:31:11.061
THAT SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT

02:31:11.128 --> 02:31:12.863
BECAUSE AS FAR AS MAPPING IS

02:31:12.930 --> 02:31:15.299
CONCERNED THREE YEARS AGO I

02:31:15.366 --> 02:31:16.634
STARTED NOTICING THAT ALL THE

02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:18.035
CARRIERS THAT I USED TO USE

02:31:18.102 --> 02:31:19.103
THAT WOULD COVER PEOPLE THAT

02:31:19.170 --> 02:31:21.372
WERE IF FIRE AREAS STARTED

02:31:21.439 --> 02:31:22.506
BACKING UP THEY WERE BRAGGING

02:31:22.573 --> 02:31:24.308
ABOUT HOW YOU CAN COME TO US

02:31:24.375 --> 02:31:25.943
BECAUSE WE ARE SURE PROTECTION

02:31:26.010 --> 02:31:27.945
CLASS TEN PROTECTION CLASS IS

02:31:28.012 --> 02:31:29.547
WHAT WE USED TO USE IN ORDER TO

02:31:29.613 --> 02:31:30.948
DETERMINE WHAT THE RISK FACTORS

02:31:31.015 --> 02:31:32.750
WERE FOR THE HOMES SO WITH

02:31:32.817 --> 02:31:34.051
SOMEONE WITHIN THE EIGHT NINE

02:31:34.118 --> 02:31:35.453
OR TEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAD

02:31:35.519 --> 02:31:36.720
TO GO TO A SPECIALTY COMPANY

02:31:36.787 --> 02:31:38.656
OR COMPANY THAT TOOK ON THOSE

02:31:38.722 --> 02:31:40.458
RISKS THOSE SAME COMPANIES

02:31:40.524 --> 02:31:41.725
TODAY THEY WON'T TOUCH PROP

02:31:41.792 --> 02:31:43.427
THOSE PROPERTIES AT THE

02:31:43.494 --> 02:31:44.628
PROTECTION CLASS CAN STILL BE A

02:31:44.695 --> 02:31:45.963
TEN BUT WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND

02:31:46.030 --> 02:31:47.031
THE SCENES IS WHAT'S CALLED

02:31:47.097 --> 02:31:50.067
MAPPING SO THE THING ABOUT MAPS

02:31:50.134 --> 02:31:51.368
IN WHO IS IN A FIRE PROTECTION

02:31:51.435 --> 02:31:52.570
CLASS I COULD TELL YOU RIGHT

02:31:52.636 --> 02:31:53.604
NOW INSURANCE COMPANIES THEY

02:31:53.671 --> 02:31:55.339
KNOW THAT BECAUSE THE SECOND

02:31:55.406 --> 02:31:56.407
I PUT IT ADDRESS INTO THE

02:31:56.474 --> 02:31:57.708
COMPUTER IT'S GOING TO TELL ME

02:31:57.775 --> 02:31:59.410
THAT PERSON CAN GET IS IF THAT

02:31:59.477 --> 02:32:01.212
PERSON QUALIFY TO GET INSURANCE

02:32:01.278 --> 02:32:03.113
WITH THAT CARRIER NOT BECAUSE

02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:04.281
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE

02:32:04.348 --> 02:32:05.449
PROTECTION CLASSES WERE BASING

02:32:05.516 --> 02:32:06.984
YOUR FIGHT APARTMENT AT THEIR

02:32:07.051 --> 02:32:08.619
FULL TIME IF THEY CAN BE THERE

02:32:08.686 --> 02:32:10.154
WITHIN THREE MINUTES IF YOU'RE

02:32:10.221 --> 02:32:11.355
WITHIN FIVE MILES AWAY IF YOU

02:32:11.422 --> 02:32:12.556
GOT TO HIDE WITHIN IT DOESN'T

02:32:12.623 --> 02:32:13.891
MEAN YOU COULD GET A DECENT

02:32:13.958 --> 02:32:15.392
RIGHT BUT NOW DOESN'T REALLY

02:32:15.459 --> 02:32:16.660
MATTER ANYMORE BECAUSE SOMEBODY

02:32:16.727 --> 02:32:18.596
WHO DRAW UP A MAP IT SAYS YOU

02:32:18.662 --> 02:32:20.965
GOT TOO MANY TREES AROUND YOU

02:32:21.031 --> 02:32:22.800
CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT TREES AND

02:32:22.867 --> 02:32:24.969
THE LOOK BUT CALIFORNIA TREES

02:32:25.035 --> 02:32:26.570
I UNDERSTAND ARE DESIGNED TO

02:32:26.637 --> 02:32:28.772
BURN EVERY FEW YEARS WHERE

02:32:28.839 --> 02:32:30.541
STATE THAT BASICALLY BURNS

02:32:30.608 --> 02:32:32.610
ITSELF EVERY FEW YEARS SO

02:32:32.676 --> 02:32:35.112
IT'S JUST WHERE WE LIVE SO

02:32:35.179 --> 02:32:36.914
WHY CAN'T WE MAKE THOSE MAPS

02:32:36.981 --> 02:32:38.749
AVAILABLE SO THAT THESE GUYS

02:32:38.816 --> 02:32:40.284
THESE REPORTS HE SAID YOU'RE

02:32:40.351 --> 02:32:41.252
IN A FLOOD ZONE OR YOU'RE IN

02:32:41.318 --> 02:32:43.420
A FIRE HAS ITS OWN SO PEOPLE

02:32:43.487 --> 02:32:45.155
HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH

02:32:45.222 --> 02:32:46.824
SO THEY CAN'T OPEN NOTICE A

02:32:46.891 --> 02:32:51.495
LATER ADDED NO OKAY SO BUILDING

02:32:51.562 --> 02:32:54.064
CODES SHOULD BE HIGHER AS FAR

02:32:54.131 --> 02:32:56.166
AS THE STANDARD THE OTHER THING

02:32:56.233 --> 02:32:58.302
IS PEOPLE TALK ABOUT RATES A

02:32:58.369 --> 02:32:59.403
LOT OF TIME SOMEBODY TO COME

02:32:59.470 --> 02:33:00.971
TO THE RIGHT AND JUST SAY I

02:33:01.038 --> 02:33:04.041
GOT A GUY WHO'S BUYING A HOUSE

02:33:04.108 --> 02:33:06.277
AND HIS INCOME IS RIGHT THERE

02:33:06.343 --> 02:33:07.845
HE COULD ONLY AFFORD TO SPEND

02:33:07.912 --> 02:33:09.146
SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE

02:33:09.213 --> 02:33:11.048
DOLLARS FOR HOME RESISTORS

02:33:11.115 --> 02:33:13.183
OTHERWISE HE CAN GET A HOUSE

02:33:13.250 --> 02:33:14.418
AND THEN I AND THEN I ALWAYS

02:33:14.485 --> 02:33:15.419
FEEL TERRIBLE BECAUSE I GOT

02:33:15.486 --> 02:33:18.789
TO SAY HEY YOU KNOW THE TO GET

02:33:18.856 --> 02:33:19.590
TO WHERE HE NEEDS TO BE IT'S

02:33:19.657 --> 02:33:21.525
GOING TO BE EIGHT HUNDRED BUCKS

02:33:21.592 --> 02:33:22.960
IF I START SHAVING AND TAKING

02:33:23.027 --> 02:33:24.595
OFF THINGS THAT BASICALLY NOW

02:33:24.662 --> 02:33:25.796
HE DOESN'T HAVE REPLACEMENT

02:33:25.863 --> 02:33:27.798
COST OF PERSONAL CONTENTS AND

AWAYS WERE HEARING HERE IN

02:45:27.350 --> 02:45:30.754

COVERAGE EIGHT LIMIT THE LIMIT

02:45:32.989 --> 02:45:35.158
ON THE DWELLING MISSILE BE MY

02:45:35.225 --> 02:45:36.993
LAST COMMENT APPRECIATE THE

02:45:37.060 --> 02:45:40.430
TIME COVERAGE A WHERE ALL THE

02:45:40.497 --> 02:45:42.899
OTHER COVERAGES FLOW FROM THAT

02:45:42.966 --> 02:45:44.567
LIMIT IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGE

02:45:44.634 --> 02:45:46.569
OF COVERAGE A THAT SHOULD

02:45:46.636 --> 02:45:49.172
NOT BE A PLACE WHERE INSURERS

02:45:49.239 --> 02:45:51.474
ARE COMPETING FOR BUSINESS

02:45:51.541 --> 02:45:53.276
BY COMING UP WITH DIFFERENT

02:45:53.343 --> 02:45:55.612
AMOUNTS FOR REBUILDING WHICH

02:45:55.679 --> 02:45:57.414
SHOULD BE BASED ON THE MOST

02:45:57.480 --> 02:45:59.883
ACCURATE AVAILABLE INFORMATION

02:45:59.949 --> 02:46:01.818
TO GET THAT COVERAGE RIGHT

02:46:01.885 --> 02:46:03.820
AND WE PROBABLY HAVE WAY FEWER

02:46:03.887 --> 02:46:06.089
CONSUMERS WITH ISSUES AND WE

02:46:06.156 --> 02:46:08.158
