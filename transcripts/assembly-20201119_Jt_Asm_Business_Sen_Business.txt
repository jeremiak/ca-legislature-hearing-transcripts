MY BRIGADE COMMANDER COLONEL GROENEWALD FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE EXCUSED MY DUTIES TO PARTICIPATE. IN THIS MEETING TODAY- SO- THE FIRST THING I REALLY WANT TO COME ON- IN A TWO NINE- THAT ARE DYING FROM AN INDUSTRY TO PLAN- THAT TALKED ABOUT- ALTHOUGH WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT BOARD- WE'VE HAD A LARGE SHARED SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD AND THE IN THE STRATEGIC PLAN THE BOARD VOTED TO MOVE TOWARDS A MORE INDEPENDENT- POSITION FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD- ESPECIALLY FOCUSED ON- OUR ENFORCEMENT- PROCESSES REALLY WANTED TO BRING THOSE IN THE HOUSE- OF THAT MOSTLY HAS TO DO WITH THE GROWTH OF THE PA PROFESSION THERE'S ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND- LICENSE PH IN CALIFORNIA NOW WHICH REPRESENTS ABOUT 10% OF THE PA'S IN THE NATION. AND SO THE BOARD TO AND BOARD STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY ON ACCOMPLISHING THAT TASK WHICH IS- A. SIGNIFICANT- PIECE OF WORK. ADDITIONAL LAST YEAR- CENTER- SPONSORED SPC NINETY MORE IS ONLY- BILL FOR PA. CAL THAT ARE REALLY- ALONG OF THE- SCOPE PRACTICE THE DEFINITION HAND UP PRACTICE PARAMETERS- FROM- BE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT INTO. AN AGREEMENT THAT IS REACHED AT THE PRACTICE LEVEL BETWEEN A PHYSICIAN IN PA- WHICH- ESSENTIALLY WAS A REWRITE OF OUR PRACTICE ACT. WE'RE STILL WORKING ON- MANY OF THE REGULATIONS- THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THAT BELL- BUT WE DID A LOT OF WORK ON THAT SINCE OUR LAST SUNSET REVIEW- AND THIS IS A THIS BILL IS A REALLY GOOD FOR OUR CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA INCREASES- ACCESS TO CARE BY ALLOWING PIERCE TO PRACTICE- TO THE FULL EXTENT. OF THEIR LICENSES- WITHOUT OVERSIGHT THAT'S SPECIFIC TO THE- PA AND PHYSICIAN AFTER PM POSITION LEVEL. SO WE'VE BEEN- WORKING QUITE. DILIGENTLY ON THAT ALSO. YEAH APPRECIATE- STAKEHOLDER. AND ESPECIALLY CENTER CARRIER ON HURST AND WORKING ON THAT BILL. SACRAMENTO OF COURSE THE CODEPEN HAS RESULTED IN A LOT OF- UNEXPECTED DEAD CHALLENGERS AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN HOW TO. MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE CONSUMERS DURING A TIME OF CRISIS SO. WE ADDED A LOT OF WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND- HAVING SOME EMERGENCY PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW THE APPEARS TO BE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE- DURING THESE TIMES. SO THAT THOSE ARE THE SORT OF BIG ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP SINCE OUR LAST CONCERT REVIEW. THERE'S BEEN SOME- GROWTH IN THE BOARD- I WANT TO RESPECT THE COMMITTEES THAT TIME TODAY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS OR ELABORATE ON ANYTHING. BUT THAT SET UP FOR THE MOST PART OF. BEYOND THE BASICS OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND THE DIRECTION. THAT WE'RE GOING WE'RE GOING FORWARD. GREAT THANK YOU MUCH. AGAIN THEY YOU VERY MUCH ALSO FOR YOUR SERVICE ON THE BOARD AND HER FELLOW COLLEAGUES ON THE BOARD AS WELL. HAVING SAID THAT WILL THEN GET GOING TO QUESTIONS FROM ANY. MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL BEGIN. WITH ANY MEMBERS IN THE ROOM CURRENTLY WHO MIGHT HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AND SO THIS WILL BE THE TIME FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM ANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ARE CURRENTLY IN THIS ROOM NOW ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME. K. SEEN THEME OF SENATOR PAT. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DID HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING THE REPORT- THIS IS A QUESTION I ASK- MADE THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS BOARDS- REGARDING CONTINUING EDUCATION SO I MAKE NOTE THAT IN YOUR REPORT YOU DO MENTION THAT YOU DO SOME AUDITS- BUT YOU DON'T PROVIDE STATISTICS AS TO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE LICENSEES DO YOU AUDIT EACH CYCLE AND TO WHAT THE- AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE AUDITS AND RESULTS AND- FINDING THAT SOMEONE DID NOT COMPLETE TO CONTINUING EDUCATION. SO AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE SHARE THAT INFORMATION- I WOULD APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. YEAH THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT QUESTION- WE'RE HAPPY TO COMMENT ON OUR- AUDIENCE FOR CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION. SO APPEARS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE- ONE HUNDRED- HOURS OF CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION TO MAINTAIN THEIR- NATIONAL. CERTIFICATION THE FIFTY HOURS OF THAT IS THAT CATEGORY ONE. CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION WHICH IS MORE FORMAL AND THEN A FIFTY HOURS IS CATEGORY TWO WHICH IS- LESS FORMAL. JOURNAL STAND. WHAT MORE. AND OUR- THAT MERE THAT REQUIRE THURSDAY NIGHT. COOL- THE BUT IT TO AND CAN PHYSICALLY OF THE- AND ALL. MAIN MARC NOW SORT OF- THROUGH THE INCREASE P. A. YOU THEY DO WE DO NOT READ PA TO BE ANTI CERTIFY- TO HAVE LIFE WITHIN K. BE ON THE AND LICENSE SO THAT NATIONAL CERTIFICATES IT COULD FOR NEW VICE INSURED BUT AFTER THAT PHD NEED TO MAKE THAT EVEN THOUGH MY PA'S DO. ANSWER THIS THAT HAVING- I N. ON TO EITHER MAINTAIN THE NC CAN GET. OR A CAN TO MEDIC AND CREDITS OUTSIDE OF THE PROCESS ALLOWS- NON NATIONALLY CERTIFIED PA'S TO CONTINUE PRACTICE AND SO WHAT WE DO IS- WE. AUDIT- THANK YOU ON I'M HAVING A LOT BIT OF A I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT PERCENT OF I WANTED STATES PERCENT THAT COULD BE MAYBE YOU COULD COMMENT ON THE PERSON OF PH THAT WE ARE IT YEAH IT IS PERCENT OKAY OKAY SO FIVE PER OF PA'S THAT OUR AUDIT- AND- YES- TO- TO THE KERR DAY WE HAVE TO ABOUT SIXTY HUNDRED IN SEVENTY A LIFE AUDIT. AUDITED END OF THAT- NINETEEN- LICENSEES FAILED THE AUDIT SO BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS WE CONTACT THE LICENSE FEE THAT WE ASK THEM TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION OF THEIR CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION OR- IF THEY ARE IN TCPA CERTIFIED REPAIR NCPA CERTIFIED WE KNOW THAT THEY'VE MET THE- JAMMY REQUIREMENTS AND SO WE JUST VERIFY THAT WITH THE NCPA YES THEY ARE NOT IN TPPA CERTIFY THEM WILL REQUIRE THEM TO SUBMIT THEIR- PROOF OF CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION OKAY AND- TO- THAT'S FAR WE'VE HAD ABOUT ONE POINT ONE THREE PERCENT- AUDITED LICENSE FEES- WILL- WHICH IS NINETEEN OF THE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE GOT HAVE NOT FAILED THE ON IT. OKAY I KNOW THAT'S VERY HELPFUL I MEAN THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PERCENTAGE AND- THE SENSE OF FAILURE I GUESS THE AUDIT FAILURE RATE SO LOW- THAN THAT I THINK THE PROBABLY PICKS UP WHAT YOU NEED TO DO THE OTHER QUESTION I USUALLY ASK BY NO LOOKING AT YOUR REPORT THAT'S NOT AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICIES FOR CONTINUED EDUCATION HOWEVER I DO KNOW THAT ALL THE BODIES OF WHAT YOU REFER TO FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION DO ALL HAVE CONSERVE INTEREST POLICIES AS FAR THEIR GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS SO. I DON'T NINE EIGHT EIGHT YES I DON'T REALLY NEED. TO ASK A QUESTION IF YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER PAN ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS. OF COMMITTEE CURRENT IN THE CHAIN AT THIS. CHECK LATER. THANK THANK YOU CARILLO A COUPLE QUESTIONS INTERESTED IN THIS IS ISSUED WAIVER TO DO WITH THE PANDEMIC. AT THEIR BEEN ANY PARTICULAR WAIVERS THAT HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO- THE POSITION ASSISTANCE BOARD AND IT'S NOT LICENSEES DURING THE PANDEMIC. YES THERE HAVE A THANK YOU FOR ASKING I APPRECIATE THAT SO- WE HAVE. RE WAIVERS THAT ARE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW- THE FIRST ONE- BASICALLY HAS TO DO WITH THE CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AND- THERE RICK YOU KNOW. SUBMIT THEIR CONTINUING EDUCATION WHEN THEY RENEW THEIR SENIOR ME. THAT WHEN THEY RENEW THEIR LICENSE PLATE- A PROVIDE THAT DOCUMENTATION UNFORTUNATELY DURING THE CALL THE PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY EARLY- IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR SOME LICENSEES TO. GET THEIR CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION COMPLETED- OR- SUBMIT THAT SO- THERE IS A WAIVER THERE. HAS STILL CURRENTLY IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO- SUBMIT THEIR DOCUMENTATION OF CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION I'M AFTER THE STATE OF EMERGENCY- IS TERMINATED- AND SO THAT IS GOING TO PLACE A I BELIEVE SENSE THAT. MAY AND THEN LET THE PROPOSED THAT IS TO ALLOW A LICENSE FEES- TO CAN TO PRESS- EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE DIFFERENT OF THERE SO DURING THE COLD RELATED CASH DOWN- BUT KNOWING THAT IT IS RE. IN THAT JUST ARGUMENT OF THE AS SOON THE EMERGENCY LEFT. ANOTHER WAIVER IS ASKED TO DO ISSUE. SO HERE HAVE A PRESS AGREE WITH OF HIS- THAT. SAYS SORT OF WHAT DUTIES ARE TO BE AND WHAT THEY'RE TO DO AND A FOR. THAT OUR SERVICE WITH THAT AGREEMENT. SOME DURING PANDEMIC- THERE MAY NOT BE TRYING TO DROP THIS DOCUMENT AS PEERS ARE CALLED UPON TO HELP IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS- AND SO- THIS WAIVER ALLOWS- PH A PRACTICE WITHOUT A PRACTICE AGREEMENT AS LONG AS THERE IS AN IDENTIFIED. SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN AND THEY HAVE HAD- A FEW OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS MANTA SO SHADED WITH THAT. AND THAT WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT WAY FOR US OTHERWISE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT SIGNED AND APPROVED IN- WORKED ON BEFORE A PA COULD REALLY STEP IN AND HELP OUT IN THE EMERGENCY SITUATION. THAT WE WORKED REALLY HARD ON THAT- WAIVER WITH THAT DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS ARE REALLY APPRECIATIVE. OF THAT HOW HARD THEY WORK IN THAT MAKING THIS. HAPPEN SERVICE WE COULD OUT PA'S COMMANDS FOR EXAMPLE FROM. OUT OF STATE ACCEPTINGTHEIR STATE LICENSURE AND- YOU KNOW ACTING AN OUT OF STATE PRACTICE AGREEMENT OR WHATEVER THEY'RE USING IN ANOTHER STATE MAY NOT HAVE MET SOME OF OUR STATE REQUIREMENTS BUT THIS WAIVER ALLOWS THEM TO PRACTICE- I WITHIN THE STATE WITHOUT MEETING THAT. AND YOU REGULATORY BURDENS. THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE TO PRACTICE. WE HAD ANOTHER WAIVER AS WELL THAT ALLOWS THAT RETIRED LICENSEES- CHU I PRACTICED- WITHIN- A TICKET TO RETURN TO PRESS. LONG THEY'RE LIKE WAS IN THAT RESTRICTED. AND THEY WERE LOOKING MAIN IF YOU'RE OF PRACTICE IT WOULD TAKE RETURN TO PRACTICE WITHOUT HAVE TO- PIZZA OF THE- OTHER REQUIRED OF THE LAW. WOULD HAD ON THEM- DURING THE TIME OF PAN AM OF THOSE ARE THE WAIVERS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. THEY'VE BEEN RENEWED OF TIMES AND ALL THESE. ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE TO THE END OF THE- OR JANUARY. WE THAT IF GIVEN THE RISE IN THE NUMBER OF COVERED NINETEEN K. THAT ARE RIGHT- WE EXPECT THESE WAIVER WILL BE CAN. AND YOU CAN DO YOU THINK THAT- YOU KNOW NOBODY KNOWS THE FEW. I WE THE EXACT BRANCH- EXERCISING THEIR WISDOM TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN HANDLE THIS PANDEMIC EMERGENCY IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER TODAY BUT RELATED IT PIQUES MY INTEREST AS TO WHETHER. WE SHOULD THROUGH STATUTORY ACTIONS PREPARE FOR THESE TYPES OF CONTINGENCIES RATHER THAN RELYING UPON EXECUTIVE ACTIONS DURING THE EMERGENCY I GUESS I'LL- THROW THAT QUESTION UP IN THE AIR YOU DON'T NEED TO ANSWER BUT I'LL- DIRECTED TO MY STAFF AND OTHERS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD CONSIDER- SUCH ACTIONS- I DO SEE THAT- YOU KNOW THE LICENSING PROCESS. HAS BEEN PRETTY EFFICIENT YOU YOU SAY AT LEAST IN THIS THE STAFF REPORT. THIRTY DAYS IS THE AVERAGE TIME DELAY FOR GETTING A LICENSE IN MOST CASES THAT RIGHT. THANK EIGHT BELIEVE THAT TAX- YES IT'S- NON COMPLICATED LICENSE IT'S ABOUT THIRTY DAYS IN OTHER WORDS THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT WOULD RAISE ANY RED FLAGS DURING THE LICENSING PROCESS. YEAH CORRECT AND SO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF APPLICATIONS TO RAISE FLAGS SAYS NO INDICATION IT IS IT'S A SMALL PURSES 2% FIVE PERCENT. OR SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAT RAIES. ISSUES THAT WOULD DELAY THE LICENSE FOR MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS. I THINK OF OSAMA MIGHT BE ABLE TO BETTER ANSWER THAT THEN I COULD ISSUES A LITTLE MORE- A FAMILIAR WITH THOSE TYPES OF THINGS BUT JUST BRIEFLY I IT WOULD BE THINGS LIKE- IF THEY HAD SOME SORT OF LICENSURE BEFORE THEY WERE AN EMT OR PARAMEDIC OR SOMETHING AND THAT. LICENSE HAD SOME SORT OF ACTION ON IT- OR- DALY- WE HAD- YOU KNOW CRIMINAL INFORMATION BACKGROUND CHECKS WHERE- THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS CONCERNING THEIR- OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ROSANA YEAH THE PHARMACIST. IS I WOULD SAY IT'S BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ON THE- WILL BE LEFT ONE PER. OF LICENSEES THAT- PRIOR OF HISTORY AND WE TAKES A- LOT LONGER THAN THIRTY DAY TO PROCESS. AND IT WILL NEED TRYING. THAT WAS WHAT CENTER AND ADDS. I'M SORRY IT WAS ONE PERSON OF MAKING SURE I COULD HEAR CORRECTLY PERCENT POINT YEAH I SAY I. A LOT LESS THAN ONE. OKAY ALL RIGHT YEAH THAT THAT'S ALL AND TO KNOW AND THERE'S A IN THAT. THAT THERE IS SHARE. US IN OUR OURS. BUT THAT'S THAT THAT'S- IN I APPRECIATE THAT- THAT EFFICIENCY AND MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS ARE. READY FOR THAT LICENSE CAN CAN GET IT QUICKLY. AND- I THINK ONE FINAL. QUESTION- THE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE. DIVERGENCE HAS- BY NECESSITY CHANGING THAT THAT THE DELIVERY OF HEALTHCARE- IN PARTICULAR- THE- YOU KNOW THE USE OF TELEHEALTH- DO YOU HAVE ANY ANY ANY INFORMATION ABOUT HOW OFTEN YOUR PA'S ARE USING TELEHEALTH SERVICES AND HAVE. AS MANY ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED BECAUSE OF THAT. HI I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION OTHER THAN ANECDOTAL INFORMATION FROM MY OWN PERSONAL PRACTICE WHICH IS THAT YEAH IT'S FAIRLY COMMON-% I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY PROBLEMS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT- YOU KNOW PA TAPPED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- PATIENT THAT THEIR- CARING FOR VIA TELEMEDICINE OR TELL OF. HEALTH TECHNOLOGY IS LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SO BECAUSE THAT IS THE AREA WHERE THEY'RE A LICENSED- YEAH BUT I OTHER THAN THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY. PARTICULAR PROBLEMS- IN MY OWN PERSONAL PRACTICE I'VE ALSO- MADE IT A POINT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- PATIENT IS IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN TALK TO ME ABOUT THEIR HEALTHCARE WITHOUT CONCERN OF. OTHERS OVER HEARING AS WELL AS IN A SAFE PLACE AND HAVE THEM CALL THE FATHER DRIVING- HELP THEM BE FOR EXAMPLE IN A RESTAURANT OR A- YOU KNOW OF. A LARGE AREA WHERE THEY CAN GET INTERNET ACCESS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR HEALTHCARE SO SORT OF THOSE PRIVACY ISSUES THAT WE REMIND PATIENTS ABOUT- BUT I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY- SIX. SAID BEAR YOUR- TO TELL THE FOR PH. N. DASH THEN. A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY YOU SEE A AT THE- AND THEN YOU TO TELL THAT YOU. THOUGHT OF- THAT ARE COMING TO THE FORE. CONVENIENCE EFFICIENCY- COST. I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME DEFINITE ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF CONVENIENCE FOR THE PATIENT- FROMA MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS AND THAT I CAN'T DO A PHYSICAL EXAM- AND IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO GET- LABORATORY ANALYSIS OR OTHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT AIDS IN THE DIAGNOSTICPROCESS- BUT I DO THINK THAT- PATIENTS- CERTAINLY- MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT THEY REALLY LIKE THEY ACCESS THAT'S THERE- IN AS WELL- YOU KNOW I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO MY PATIENTS AND KIND OF SEE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEM IT CAN BE FRUSTRATING SOMETIMES. BECAUSE OF THAT JUST THE LIMITATIONS OF THE TECHNOLOGY WHERE- YOU KNOW INFORMATION CUTS OUT- DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT OR SOMETIMES THEY'LL- GET A TELEHEALTH VISIT AND THEN HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO GO ON AND HAVE AN IN PERSON VISIT AS WE DISCOVER MORE INTRICATE INFORMATION ON THE TELE HEALTH BUT I DO THINK THAT- YEAH CERTAINLY- THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS THAT DEVELOP TO TELEHEALTH AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE IT ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE SET RESTRICTIONS- ON THE PATIENT'S ABILITY TO TRAVELER BETWEEN IN PERSON. AND YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY'RE COMPLAINING IS- IT IS AN APPROPRIATE MEDIUM FOR- FOR SOME COMPLAINTS AND OTHERS. SAY THEY REALLY NEED TO BE SEEN IN PERSON. THANK YOU MUCH THE FOR THE GOOD WORK THAT THE YOUR VOICE. AND IT THIS BUT- AREA IF THERE ARE. PLACES IN WHICH WE SHOULD- EXAMINE CLOSELY- HOW TELEHEALTH CAN BE. UTILIZED AND- WE'RE ALL PATIENT HEALTH ISSUES ARE. PROPERLY SCENE- ANY ANY FEEDBACK OR INSIGHT IS ALWAYS APPRECIATED THERE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHECK LATER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CURRENTLY IN THE CHAMBERS AT THIS TIME.

SHARE YES- YEAH I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS YES WE WOULD UKIAH KILEY IDENT. IDENTIFY YOURSELF CAN YOU BACK HERE WHEN HELLO IN THE MORNING WORK. YES HELLO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE- WORKFORCE SHORTAGE ISSUES OF HOW TO OUR LICENSING REQUIREMENTS FOR PA'S- COMPARED TO OTHER STATES. THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- I'VE ACTUALLY I'M SORRY I DIDN'T WASN'T ABLE TO- HERE. TO WHOM THE QUESTION WAS FROM. THE QUESTION IS FROM ASSEMBLYWOMAN JACQUI IRWIN. OKAY THANK YOU- MR WELL I AM LICENSED IN OR PRE BEEN PREVIOUSLY LICENSED IN THREE STATES SO I CAN CERTAINLY CAN- COMPARED TO THOSE- BUT YEAH GENERALLY SPEAKING- ARE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS- ARE SIMILAR TO MOST STATES- IN THAT WE REQUIRE A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE- BACKGROUND CHECK- CRIMINAL INFORMATION CHECK WE VERIFIED THAT- THAT THE APPLICANT HAS NOT GOT ANY- ADVERSE. ACTIONS ON THEIR- LICENSE IF THEY'RE COMING FROM ANOTHER STATE- MAKING SURE THAT THEY AFFECT HAD- MEDICAL MALPRACTICE THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE- THE DETAILS ON THAT- AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT THEY- YOU KNOW ME TO ALL THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PRESCRIBED IN OUR VARIOUS REGULATIONS- HAVING THEM LICENSED IN BOTH NEVADA AND WASHINGTON- I CAN SAY THAT. OUR PROCESS AND- REQUIREMENTS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THE STATE OF WASHINGTON- AND SOMEWHAT SOON ABOUT A- WHICH OF WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THAT DAY- AT THE TIME I WAS LICENSE ARE REQUIRED. PERSONAL APPEARANCE BEFORE THE BOARD TO OBTAIN A LICENSE WHICH WE DO NOT REQUIRE- THAT I THINK I EVER WENT TO- LAST YEAR AND MEETING AT THE FEDERATION OF STATE MEDICAL BOARDS WAS ABLE TO TALK TO- MY COLLEAGUES FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND MOST OF OUR PROCESSES AND PRACTICES ARE QUITE. SIMILAR TO OTHER STATES. ARIZONA WE YOU HAVE ANY TO ADD THEIR- AND NOW YOU THAT. YOU SAID PRETTY WELL BEING YOU. AND THEN I HAD- OTHER THAT OF YOU KNOW IT'S AND OF A AUNT CONCERN. AND US IN THE AND THAT'S A- GETTING CARE PROFESSIONALS TO INTO UNDERSERVED AREAS WHAT IS BEING DONE OR WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE TO ATTRACT PA'S TO UNDERSERVED AREAS IN CALIFORNIA. I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION AS A YOU KNOW I GREW UP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND- WHO LIVED THERE FOR QUITE SOME TIME- AND THERE IS A YOU KNOW SORT OF HAVE WE UNDERSERVED AREA THERE I APPRECIATE THE- EMPHASIS ON MAKING SURE THAT WE GET PROVIDERS TO WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED. MOST IN THOSE UNDERSERVED AREAS- THE PA BOARD SAID JOB REALLY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT- AT PJ'S ARE PRACTISING SAFELY WHEREVER THEY'RE SAYING- CONSUMERS WHETHER. CHEN AND UNDERSERVED AREA OR NOT. MANY OF THE PROGRAMS WITHIN CALIFORNIA- TRY TO RECRUIT AND EMPLOYEE SAID APPEARING THEN THOSE UNDERSERVED AREAS AND THERE ARE MANY- PROGRAMS FOR PA IF THEY GO TO THOSE AREAS TO OBTAIN. A LOAN REPAYMENT AND THAT SORT OF THING BY US SO WE CERTAINLY TRACK. BEAT THE PLAYA P. EIGHTEEN- WE DON'T- THE PEOPLE DOES NOT TRACK THE DISTRIBUTION OF WHERE THEIR- PRACTICING- THAT THERE ARE OTHER AS STATE AGENCIES THAT DO THAT WE ARE MORE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT IN PARTICULAR- BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROCESSES THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO PRACTICE. IN RURAL AREAS AND IN FACT THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT BENEFITS- SB SIX NINETY SEVEN IS THAT IT DOES ALLOW MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR APPEARS TO BE PRACTICING. AND SOME OF THOSE RURAL AREAS REMOVED SOME OF THE MORE ONEROUS THAT SUPERVISION REQUIREMENTS. SO THAT PH COULD PRACTICE- SAFELY IN THOSE AREAS AND PROVIDE. INCREASED ACCESS TO CARE. RIGHT THANK YOU.

TO THAT BILL- THAT WERE PROPOSED AS A PART OF THEIR SUNSET REVIEW REPORT FOR THE REASONS LAID OUT IN OUR LETTER- IN BECAUSE THOSE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WERE THEMSELVES OPPOSED LAST YEAR BY CAP- THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND SENATOR CAFIERO- THE FINAL THING IS I WANTED TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER. IRWIN QUESTION BACK UNDERSERVED AREAS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT WHY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT IN A KAPPA IS ATTEMPTING TO MIRROR THE I BELIEVE IT'S THE STEVEN THOMPSON.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THEIR MUCH RADICALS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CALLS WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER TWO WHICH IS THE REVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE. AND UNDERSTAND THAT- THAT THE NEXT OUT. WITNESSES B. ALSO JOINING US THROUGH VIDEO CONFERENCE AS WELL. AGAIN THIS IS NOW ON THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE. AND WILL BE JOINED BY A FEW OF OUR COMMISSIONERS. A FIRST OFF WE ARE JOINED BY DOUG MCAULEY SECONDS BY SANDRA. NOW AND THIRDLY BY STEPHEN LERNER ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER FOR LEGAL AFFAIRS. THE COMMISSIONERS FEEL PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES WE CAN WELCOME THANK YOU. THANK YOU I LIKE TO THINK SHARES MY NAME IS DOUG MCCAULEY I'M REAL STATE COMMISSIONER I'VE BEEN SORT OF SERVING IN THIS ROLE SINCE MAY OF THIS YEAR. AND IS YOU INDICATED WITH ME IS STEVEN LEARNER WHO'S OUR SYSTEM COMMISSIONER FOR LEGAL AFFAIRS AND SANDRA NOW WHO'S OUR ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER FOR ADMINISTRATION AND LICENSING. I'D ALSO LIKE TO COMMEND COMMITTEE STAFF WE KNOW THE HARD WORK INVOLVES TO GET THROUGH OUR EXTENSIVE REPORTING THE METRICS AND IDENTIFY GOOD ISSUES TO BRING FORTH A FRUITFUL CONVERSATION FOR US TODAY SO WE CAN COLLABORATE- SO WE'RE PARTICULARLY PLEASED TO HAVE THE COOPERATIVE APPROACH THAT WE ENJOYED. DURING THIS PROCESS. AND SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE SOME OF THE OPERATIONAL COMPONENTS- DIARI AND THEN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ECONOMIC. REALITIES AND WE WILL STATE FROM THERE I'LL TALK ABOUT WHY WE ACTUALLY REGULATE THE PROFESSION AND WHAT OUR APPROACH IS TO DO SO- AND THEN LASTLY THERE'S A KEY POLICY ISSUE I'D LIKE TO IDENTIFY THAT I KNOW IS CLOSE TO SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES. SO FIRST WITH RESPECT TO DRV UR MISSION IS TO BE. TO SAFEGUARD AND PROMOTE THE PUBLIC INTEREST OF REAL ESTATE THROUGH REGULATION LICENSING EXAMINATION AND EDUCATION AND OUR VISION IS TO BE THE CHAMPIONS OF PUBLIC PROTECTION IN REAL ESTATE. AND WE'RE VERY CLEAR THAT THAT SAME CONCEPT IS EMBEDDED IN OUR STATUTE BROADEN CENTER THE CONSUMER PROTECTION. IS PRIORITY ONE WITH RESPECT TO THE SCOPE OF OUR UNIVERSE WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND LICENSEES WHICH IS COMPRISED OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND SALESPERSONS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND BROKERS. AND TWENTY SIX THOUSAND MORTGAGE LOAN ORIGINATORS WE ALSO A REVIEW AND APPROVE SUBDIVISIONS AND LAST FISCAL YEAR WE APPROVE TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED PUBLIC. REPORTS WHICH EQUATES. TO THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND UNITS OF NEW HOUSING. TO DRIVE THIS WE HAVE THREE HOW AND SIXTEEN STAFF MEMBERS OF DIARI HOW DIDN'T. FIVE DID OFFICES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA EACH OF WHICH EXAM. ASSOCIATED WITH. OUR BUDGET TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. OVER THE LAST YEARS WE'VE ARE HARD TO RE CONCERT OURSELVES AS A- WE WERE. A BUREAU THE OF. AFFAIRS AND I'M- PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE OR DOES THAT ALL OF THE COME. OF THAT BUILD OUT ARE NOW AND WE'RE FULLY FUNCTION AS A DEPARTMENT. SO NOW BIT ABOUT THE ECHO FOOTPRINT OF REALISTIC IT'S A REAL ESTATE IN CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR BILLION. OF OUR GROSS PRODUCT APPROXIMATE TWENTY PERCENT. AND THEN EACH INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION. GENERATES A HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND OF ECONOMIC POSITIVE AND IMPACT IN THE LOCAL MARKET. LOOKING FORWARD TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE ARE LOOKING FOR A MODEST INCREASE IN EXISTING HOME SALES. OF APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT THREE PERCENT. AND IN TERMS OF THE MEDIAN HOME PRICE WE'RE LOOKING AT AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT THREE AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THESE NUMBERS ARE COURTESY OF THE CALIFORNIA REALTORS ASSOCIATION AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. SO WITH RESPECT TO WHY WE REGULATE REAL ESTATE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE NATURE OF THESE TRANSACTIONS FOR YOUR AVERAGE AN ORDINARY CONSUMER. IT'S GOING TO BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL COMMITMENT THEY MAKE IN THEIR LIFE. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THOSE TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE WE'RE TALKING LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF STATUTES AND OBLIGATIONS THAT HAVE TO BE EFFECTUATED PROPERLY. TO ENSURE CONSUMER PROTECTION. AND THEN LASTLY AGAIN I REFER YOU BACK TO THE ECONOMIC FOOTPRINT BECAUSE OF THEM BACK INTO A WHAT REAL ESTATE. INVOLVED FINANCIALLY IN CALIFORNIA YOU DO HAVE A TENDENCY TO SEE ABOUT ACTORS TRYING TO ENTER THE MARKET PLACE. AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CONSUMERS. SO WHAT THAT MEANS FOR US IN TERMS OF OUR PHILOSOPHY IS WE WORK HARD TO BE VERY PREVENTIVE WITH OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS IT'S- MUCH MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO BE PREVENTIVE RATHER THAN PROMEDIO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTION. IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE AND IT'S VERY TIME CONSUMING TO PROSECUTE CASES. WE CAN BE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE BY. GETTING OUT THERE THE QUITTING THE PROFESSION WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED TO OPERATE WITHIN THE CONFINES OF REAL ESTATE LAW. AND ALSO EDUCATE CONSUMERS SO THEY CAN HAVE THEIR GUARD UP AND BE PREPARED TO HAVE SUCCESSFUL TRANSACTIONS. AND WE'RE WORKING TO ENHANCE OUR EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD WERE ACTUALLY FURTHER BUILDING OUT OF COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLICATIONS OPERATION SO WE CAN DO MORE. AND USE DIFFERENT MODALITY IS FOR A NEW CATIONS AND EDUCATION I'M PERSONALLY VERY FIRMLY COMMITTED TO THIS DURING MY SHORT TENURE I'VE ALREADY PRESENTED TO FORTY DIFFERENT LOCAL ASSOCIATIONS OF REALTORS AND IT'S- IN A TREMENDOUS. WAY TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON VARIOUS LOCAL MARKETS. AND WHAT THEIR CHALLENGES ARE. SO AGAIN WE'RE BACK THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS PROFESSION ECONOMIC IMPACT IT DOES IN FACT TEND TO DRAW SOME OF THOSE BAD APPLES INTO THE MARKETPLACE- UNLICENSED PRACTICE IS A- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO US AND ONE OF THE POINTS OF EMPHASIS FOR ME COMING AND- IS LEVERAGING OUR CITATION PROGRAM. PREVIOUSLY THAT APARTMENT TO ROCK RELIED PRIMARILY ON THE SYSTEM REFRAIN ORDERS BUT I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO. BE AS IMPACTFUL AS YOU CAN WITH THESE ACTIONS IN THE FINANCIAL PENALTY. CERTAINLY ACCOMPLISHES ABOUT SO WE WANT A STRONG DETERRENT IN THE MARKETPLACE AND WE ARE. GOING TO RAMP UP OUR USE OF THE CITATION. AUTHORITY ANIMAL WAITED LOWER US CLEANER EFFORTS TO POLICE THE MARKET. AND THIS PROBLEM SO WE'RE INCREASING OUR ACTIVITIES- THE OTHER VARIOUS ONLINE PRESENCES TO MONITOR AND IDENTIFY THESE BAD ACTORS IN THE MARKETPLACE. IN ADDITION WE'RE CONNECTING WITH THE LOCAL ASSOCIATIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS OF THEM AND- UNDER FOUR HUNDRED OF US SO WE DEFINITELY RELY ON THEM TO SHARE WITH US. WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE MARKET PLACE AND WE APPRECIATE. THAT COLLABORATION. AND THEN LASTLY WE'RE LEVERAGING OUR INVESTIGATIVE UNIT SO WE CAN ALSO USE THOSE TO TRIAL INFORMATION ABOUT- OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO STEP IN. IN THE MARKETPLACE. FOR ME. SO THE OTHER HALF OF A BACK CONSUMER PROTECTION USED EAM. THAT'S GONNA WHETHER FOLKS COMING INTO THE MARKET PLACE. HAVE THE REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE SKILLS AND ABILITIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN A SAFE AND REASONABLE WAY FOR CONSUMERS. SO WE REALLY REALLY VALUE THE COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS THE REAL RELY UPON TO. CRAFT THE CONTENT FOR THE EXAM IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WE'RE TESTING PER WHAT'S GOING ON IN. TODAY'S MARKET PLACE BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO EXPAND ACCESS TO THE EXAM.SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO DO OUT VIA NEW TECHNOLOGY OR PERHAPS OTHER PRESENCES IN CALIFORNIA. TO OFFER THE EXAM. ON THE POLICY SIDE I DEFINITELY WATER PRIVATE PUT A BRIGHT LIGHT ON THIS BECAUSE I KNOW SO MANY OF YOU. HAVE YOUR HANDS ON THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR BUT SHORTLY AFTER I LANDED A D. R. READ WE TOOK ON THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF UPDATING THE KIND OF GUY WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY PART OF PUBLISHED BY. THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO AND IT WAS IN. DIRE NEED OF AN UPDATE WHICH WE DID AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT WORK WE USE A VERY INCLUSIVE PROCESS TO RECEIVE STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AND ENSURE THAT WE PRODUCED A QUALITY. AND BALANCED DOCUMENT BUT- WITH OUR CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH CLIMATE AND ALL THE AFFECTS OF COVERT PARTICULAR ON UNEMPLOYMENT REDUCED WAGES. AND HOW MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE EXPERIENCING HOUSING INSECURITY. IT WAS QUICKLY NECESSARY FOR CALIFORNIA STEP UP AND TAKE SOME APPROPRIATE ACTION TO CREATE SOME NEW PROTECTIONS. SO ASSEMBLY MEN'S TO CHOOSE SOME OF THE AUTHORITY EIGHTY EIGHT WAS SIGNED BY GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM ON. AUGUST THE THIRTY FIRST AS AN EMERGENCY MEASURE AND IT HAD SOME CRITICAL PROTECTIONS THAT NEEDED. TO BE IMPLEMENTED INTO ORDER SO THAT TENANTS COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE AND LANDLORDS WOULD UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES AND SO. WHILE THE INK WAS STILL WET ON THE BILL WE WERE CRAFTING THE REQUIRED DECLARATIONS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES TO POST THEM ON THE WEBSITE AND- THE GOVERNOR'S CAMPAIGN IN THE SPACES CALL HOUSING IS KEY AND THE WEBSITE IS HOUSING IS KEY DOT COM SO. THE WEBSITE HOUSES THOSE REQUIRE DECLARATIONS ALONG WITH OTHER SUPPORT MATERIAL. FAQS FACT SHEETS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY RESOURCES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE OFTEN. IN THESE SCENARIOS LEGAL REPRESENTATION IT IS NEEDED ALMOST ALWAYS SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THAT DIRECTION DOWN TO LOCAL RESOURCES. BUT AS YOU WELL KNOW AS LAWMAKERS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DISTILL DOWN LEGISLATIVE INFORMATION SO THE GRASS ROOTS LEVEL. IN SHORT ORDER SO WE TOOK A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL STEPS SO FIRST PARTNERING WITH OUR FRIENDS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. WE COLLABORATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE LAW SCHOOL. AND A TECH COMPANY ON THE EAST COAST CALL ME OUT SO. LARGE AND WE CRAFTED IN. OUT WHICH WOULD ACT WALK THE USE THROUGH THE VERY FAST OF THE LAW. BASE UPON THE FACT. SO THEY CAN BETTER. PROTECTION THEY ENJOY. UNDER THE LOS. IF THE BANK OF THAT. I'M HEARING FEEDBACK. MISTER CHAIR CAN YOU STILL HEAR ME YES WE CAN THANK YOU. I THOUGHT I LOST YOU FOR A MOMENT SO- WITH RESPECT TO THE APP IN THE COLLABORATION WITH UC IRVINE OF A TECH COMPANY ALL THE SUPPORT SERVICES FROM THOSE THIRD PARTIES WERE PROVIDED PRO BONO SO WE'RE VERYPROUDOF THAT WORK. ADDITIONALLY WE WANTED TO FIND OTHER MEANS TO CONNECT THIS INFORMATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SO WE PARTNERED WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WERE ABLE TO EMBED LANDLORD TENANT INFORMATION ON THE STATEWIDE TWO ONE ONE SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY AND SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED WHEN YOUR YOUR HOME THE DISTRICTS ARE WE ALSO UPDATED THE LEGISLATURE'S LANDLORD TENANT. SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THIS WORK. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE PROTECTIONS TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF JANUARY SO- THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ADDITIONAL LEFT FORTHCOMING TO. FIND OTHER MEANS TO KEEP CALIFORNIANS HOUSE. AND SO WITHOUT ON THE COINCIDE FOR US LIKE ALL DEPARTMENTS BOARDS AND BUREAUS THERE WAS A DIRECT EFFECT OPERATIONALLY ON US. SO WE WERE CLOSED DOWN TO THE PUBLIC FOR A SHORT WHILE BUT- I'M PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE HAVE 87% OF OUR STAFF. ON THE TELEWORK SCHEDULE. ADDITIONALLY THE MOST- VISIBLE COMPONENT OF THE IMPACTS TO OUR CONSUMERS WAS OF COURSE THE EXAM CENTER BECAUSE IT WAS SHUT DOWN FOR A WHILE. AND ONCE WE ACQUIRED ALL THE REQUISITE EQUIPMENT PLEXI GLASS SHATTERING- WE ARE OPERATING AT PROUD OF OUR STAFF AND THE SPACE BECAUSE- THROUGH DILIGENT SCHEDULING AGGRESSIVELY CONTACTING OUR APPLICANTS TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE GONNA. EARLY COMMITTED OUR TIME WE'VE ACTUALLY ADMINISTERED MORE EXAMS THAN WE DID THIS TIME LAST YEAR. SO AGAIN WE'RE THRILLED TO BE BUILT OUT AS THE DEPARTMENT ONCE AGAIN I'M REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE THERE'S A NEW COMMISSIONER- FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS WE HAVE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF EXECUTIVES ON OUR TEAM TWO OF WHICH ARE ON- THIS WEBCAST WITH ME TODAY SO WE'RE VERY WELL POSITIONED TO CONTINUE OUR EXCELLENT CONSUMER PROTECTION WORK. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO FIRM FURTHER OUR CONSUMER PROTECTION EFFORTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMMISSIONER MACAULEY OF WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR. YOUR SERVICE AND YOUR TEAM AS WELL. AND ONE L. OFFER OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS OR PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AND WILL BEGIN WITH ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CURRENTLY IN THE ASSEMBLY CHAMBERS AT THIS TIME WITH ANY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE LIKE TO SPEAK AT THIS TIME. YOUR GLAZER. THANK YOU CHAIR LOW- AND THANK YOU FOR THE REPORT- AND FOR WORKING WITH OUR STAFFS ON A FEW OF THE ISSUES THAT REMAIN FROM OUR SUNSET FROM BEFORE AND WE HAVE HERE. STILL IN PLAY- JUST A COUPLE SMALL QUESTIONS THAT DOES YOUR DEPARTMENT OFFER EXAMINATIONS IN- AND OTHER LANGUAGES. WE DO NOT AT THIS TIME. AND WHY IS THAT. LARGELY- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE HAVE A ROVISION OF THE LAW THAT REQUIRES COMPETENCY IN ENGLISH AS A FUNCTION OF BECOMING LICENSED VASTLY THE EXAM IS OFFERED ONLY IN ENGLISH AT THIS TIME. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT THE VALUE AND KNOWING ENGLISH I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S- RESPONSIVE TO THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- DOESN'T REQUIRE SOMEONE TO KNOW ENGLISH TO PURCHASE A HOME IS THAT RIGHT. THAT IS CORRECT AND SO WHY WOULD WE NOT. MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE LICENSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE- HAD A REPRESENT THAT SAME DIVERSITY OF CULTURE AND LANGUAGE. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY A FAIR QUESTION- CENTER WERE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO IT AND IDENTIFY THE METRICS THAT WE BE NEEDING TO HAVE TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON THIS BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT GIVEN THE- DIVERSITY IN CHAPTER OF CALIFORNIANS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE BE MINDFUL OF THIS AND THAT OUR PROGRAMS REFLECTED- YOU KNOW- WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE- INCOME INEQUALITY BUT- FOR THOSE WHO TO GIVE A KID A CAREFUL EXAMINATION. YOU KNOW YOU REALLY SEE- PROBLEM OF ASSET INEQUALITY. AND WE KNOW THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP IS ONE OF THOSE KEY AREAS- AND ABILITY TO- PROVIDE ECONOMIC STABILITY- FOR THE PRESIDENT THE FUTURE- AND THAT. YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS SOME WORRY OUT THERE AND I GUESS IT'S ADDRESSED IN THE STAFF REPORT ON WHAT ABOUT- DUAL REPRESENTATION YOU KNOW THE INSIDER DEALS. WERE ONLY THE INSIDERS GET TO KNOW ABOUT HOMES THAT MAY BE FOR SALE. IT REALLY THREATEN ME UP CORD ABOUT HOW CAREFUL WE HAVE TO BE TO ENSURE. NOT JUST IN THE AREA- IN YOUR DEPARTMENTS- SPACE BUT IN ALL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT THAT WE- WE MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE STRUGGLED THAT THAT THAT WE GIVE THEM A- HELPING HAND TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ALL THE- OPPORTUNITIES- TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND TO ACQUIRE REAL ESTATE IN. AND LIVE GREAT LIVES SO- THIS IS A PLACE OF SOME SENSITIVITY TO ME AND I KNOW TO OTHERS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR EXAMINATION ATTENTION TO THAT AND CERTAINLY THE ISSUE OF LANGUAGE IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE- IT CAN BE A HUGE BARRIER THINK ABOUT THAT. YOU'RE TRYING TO BUY SOME PROPERTY IN ANOTHER COUNTRY YOU DON'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU AND YOU KNOW THE VALUE OF IT. WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE SOME WHITE WHY WOULD WE NOT DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO. MAKE IT AS EASY AS WE CAN FOR PEOPLE AND- WE WOULD IF WE KNOW THIS ISSUE IN TERMS OF VOTING. AND THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE MAKE ON COUNTIES PROVIDE. VOTING PAFFORD SAID LOTS OF LANGUAGES AND SO- I NOTICE COMES A LITTLE BIT OUT OF THE BLUE MISTER CHAIRMAN BUT- I'M GLAD WE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OF HELP WE CAN EXAMINE IT FURTHER.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON ANNA BACK WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS OUR ORGANIZATION HAVE MEMBERS WHICH IS IN THE RANGE OF ABOUT 40% OF THE REAL ESTATE LICENSEE POPULATION AND IN THE STATE WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. IN LIGHT OF THE DEMANDS MADE ON THE DEPARTMENT REAL ESTATE IN THE STAFFING ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE BRIEFING PAPER ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC C. A. R. IS VERY SENSITIVE TO THE NEED FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO STAY CLOSE TO ITS CORE MISSION OF. SAFEGUARDING AND PROMOTING THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN REAL ESTATE MATTER THROUGH LIKE YOUR REGULATION EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT ENSURING THAT THE LICENSING PROCESS IS PROPERLY AND FAIRLY ADMINISTERED AND THAT LIFE EITHER PROPERLY REGULATED IS ESSENTIAL TO THE INTERESTS OF BOTH THE INDUSTRY AND THE PUBLIC- WE HAVE HAD ONGOING CONCERNS IN THE PAST ABOUT THE CONSISTENCY. OF THE APPLICATION OF THE ARE YOU DISCIPLINE AND THE TREATMENT OF VIOLATIONS BY AUDITORS HOWEVER WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP AT THE DEPARTMENT I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE MAY BE CHANGES IN THESE AREAS BUT WE ONCE AGAIN WANT TO URGE THE DEPARTMENT TO CAREFULLY REVIEW THEIR ENFORCEMENT APPROACH SO THAT SIMILARLY SITUATED LIKE THESE. ARE TREATED SIMILARLY. TO BE CLEAR AREN'T EIGHT IS IN OF BIGGER IMPORTANT OF THE LAW TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. OUR MEMBERS ARE THE MOST AFFECTED BY THAT ACCURATE THAT- CAN EMERGE ESPECIALLY DURING TRYING TIMES SUCH AS THESE. THE NEED TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON THE CORE MISSION HOWEVER SPEAKS AGAIN. OUR MISSION CREEP OR THE ASSUMPTION OF NUDITY NEW DUTIES. SOME OF WHICH- ARE BROUGHT UP IN IN THE BRIEFING PAPER TODAY AS AS THE COMMISSIONER MENTIONED THE PURCHASE OF A HOME. IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FINANCIAL PURCHASE THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE EVER MAKE. AND IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT THEY COMMISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO BE THE FOCUS- WITH REGARD TO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC ISSUES RAISED BY COMMITTEE STAFF. I DO HAVE A FEW COMMENTS. FIRST WE BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION AND YOU'LL AGENCIES AND- ADDRESSED A DETAILED AGENCY DISCLOSURE FORM THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN STATUTE- I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES PURPOSES. THE COMMITTEE REPORT REPRESENTS EIGHTY TEN FIFTY NINE AS A BILL TO BARRED YOU'LL AGENCY BUT IN FACT THE FOR THE BILL TO BAR YOU'LL AGENCY SOLELY IN THE COMMERCIAL ARENA. THE COMMITTEE ALSO IDENTIFIES THE RECENT AND LIKELY ONGOING LEGISLATION IN. B. AT HOUSING AND LANDLORD TENANT ARENA- I'D LIKE TO STATE THAT WE BELIEVE ONCE AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT CORE MISSION HERE SHOULD BE TO MAKE SURE LICENSE FEES ARE IN COMPLIANCE AND WHERE RELEVANT EDUCATED ON THESE ISSUES. HOWEVER WE DO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT MISSION CREEP AND THIS AND OTHER AREAS. THAT THE COMMITTEE BRINGS UP AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT. GIVEN THE LIMITED RESOURCES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE THE CONDUIT FOR PROVIDING INFORMATION ON THESE ISSUES EXCEPT. IN SO FAR AS- FORMED- VERY. I THINK THOSE HEIRONEOUS- INTERRUPTION PLEASE CONTINUE. APARTMENT SHOULD BE A CONDUIT OTHERS AB FOR PROVIDING THAT INFORMATION EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS- IT WOULD CONFORM TO THE MISSION STATEMENT- AND DISTANT INCLUDED I JUST WOULD LIKE TO THANK- THE COMMITTEE AND- THE DEPARTMENT AND WE- WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT HERE TODAY.

APPRAISER APPRAISAL MANAGEMENT MANY REGISTRATION AT HORSE PROVIDERS. FIRST ONE BACKGROUND JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND THE BUREAU'S BUDGET IS FUNDED SOLELY THROUGH FEES CHARGED TO LICENSEES REGISTERED FROM FORCED RIDERS. FACTORS SUCH AS PUMP. AND EMPLOYER RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION RATE INCREASES FOR THE REALLY THE MAIN CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE BUREAU'S ANNUAL INCREASES IN EXPENDITURES. IN ADDITION THE BUREAU'S DRASTIC DECLINE OF ITS APPRAISER LICENSEE POPULATION. A TO A REDUCTION IN REVENUE IN STATE IS ANOTHER FACTOR DRIVING FACTOR PROJECT CONTRIBUTING TO THE NEED FOR THE THEME. APPAREL HAS LOST MORE THAN HALF OF ITS LICENSE APPRAISER POPULATION OVER THE PAST DECADE. THE PRICE BE STRUCTURE INCLUDED A SIGNIFICANT SURPLUS DATING BACK TO THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND STARTING IN. TWO THOUSAND TWO ACTUALLY UP TO TWO THOUSAND NINE LOANS WERE MADE TO THE GENERAL FUND TOTALING AN AMOUNT OF NINETY. SIX MILLION DOLLARS.

OKAY GREAT- AGAIN IT JUST A GOING BACK OVER THE BUREAU AND WITH THAT IT DOES THE BUREAU ACTUALLY LICENSES AND REGULATES REAL ESTATE APPRAISERS AND REGISTERS APPRAISAL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE BEER WAS ENTIRELY FUNDED BY REGULATORY FEES AND THE GIRLS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCREDITATION OF EDUCATIONAL COURSES AND COURSE PROVIDERS FOR A REALESTATE APPRAISER LICENSING. AND CERTIFICATION. THE BUREAU SUBMITTED A SUNSET REPORT NEARLY A YEAR AGO AND THREE MISTER LANDS AND FORMER BUREAU CHIEF MARTIN'S LEADERSHIP THE BUREAU HAS REMAINED STEADFAST IN ITS COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND REGULATING THE REAL ESTATE APPRAISER INDUSTRY. THE DEPARTMENT AND THE BUREAU RECEIVED THE DRAFT BACKGROUND PAPER FROM THE COMMITTEE ON NOVEMBER THIRTEENTH. AND THE FINAL VERSION ON TUESDAY AND WE REALLY WANT TO THANK AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMMITTEE STAFF CONTINUED DILIGENCE DURING THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIME. AND AGAIN JUST THANK THEM FOR THEIR WORK ON ALL OF THE PAPERS. ZERO FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE DURING THE SUNSET PROCESSON THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. HOWEVER WITH THAT BEIG SAID I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. SO EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THE BUREAU DID INCREASE ITS FEES REGULATIONS FOR APPRAISER LICENSING. APPRAISAL A MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE REGISTRATION AND COURSE PROVIDERS AS WELL. I JUST GIVING YOU SOME BACKGROUND ON THE NEXT ISSUE THAT AROSE BUDGET IS FULLY FUNDED THROUGH FEES CHARGED TO LICENSEES REGISTRANTS AND COURSE PROVIDERS. OF FACTORS SUCH AS EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYER RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION RATE INCREASES FOR THE MAIN CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE BUREAU'S ANNUAL INCREASE IN EXPENDITURES. IN ADDITION HEROES DRASTIC DECLINE OF ITS APPRAISER LICENSING POPULATION LEADING TO A REDUCTION IN REVENUE INTAKE WAS ANOTHER DRIVING FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE MEETING FOR THE FINANCING. THE BUREAU HAS ACTUALLY LOST MORE THAN HALF OF ITS LICENSED APPRAISER POPULATION OVER THE PAST DECADE. THE PRIOR FEE STRUCTURE IN LOOTED A SIGNIFICANT SURPLUS DATING BACK TO THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND. STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND TWO UP TO TWO THOUSAND NINE ONE FOR MADE TO THE GENERAL FUND AND THEY HAVE TOTAL ABOUT NINETEEN OINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE BUREAU TEMPORARILY REDUCED ITS LICENSING FEES TO THAT SURPRISE. YOU TO THE BUREAU'S FISCAL PRUDENCE AND THE GENERAL FUND LOAN REPAYMENT WITH INTEREST STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND AND THE BUREAU WAS ABLE TO OPERATE IN DID NOT ELIMINATE THE FEE REDUCTION ACTUALLY UNTIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. ALTHOUGH THE GENERAL FUND LOAN REPAYMENTS ALLEVIATED THE NEED FOR A FEE INCREASE FOR THOSE YEARS THERE STILL EXISTED A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE IN THE BOAT HEROES BUDGET AND ONCE THE GENERAL FUND LOAN REPAYMENTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY PAID BACK. I AM AND THE CASH INFUSION BASICALLY STOP AT THAT POINT THE BUREAU NEEDED TO RAISE FEES AND DID SO VIA REGULATIONS IN JANUARY OF. AND THAT'S WHAT LED UP TO ALL OF THAT. OVER THE PAST YEARS THE BUREAU REDUCE EXPENDITURES AND IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL COST SAVING MEASURES INCLUDING ELIMINATING FIVE POSITIONS FOR APPROXIMATELY 500-500-1000 DOLLARS. I'M IN ANNUAL SAVINGS AND ALSO MOVED ITS OFFICE FROM DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. OUT TO RANCHO CORDOVA FOR A SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OVER EIGHT YEARS. ZERO CONTINUES TO MONITOR ITS REVENUE AND EXPENDITURES CLOSELY AND WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE THOSE COSTS. THE DEPARTMENT WILL WORK WITH THE BUREAU TO ENSURE THE BEER WAS FUN CONDITION IS BEING MONITORED VERY CLOSELY. REGARDING NINETEEN AND ITS IMPACT ON HERE I'M PLEASE I'M APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE INDIVIDUALS AT THE BUREAU- OF THE STAFF ARE ACTUALLY TELL WORKING DURING THE SENATE. THE BILL HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY BACKWARDS AS A RESULT OF THE WORK ENVIRONMENT CHANGES. OF THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD A LIMITED IMPACT ON REAL ESTATE APPRAISER INDUSTRY HOWEVER THE BUREAU WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND COMMUNICATE WITH STAKEHOLDERS REPORT WE SHOULD THIS CHANGE. IF YOU'RE HAS PROVIDED INFORMATION TO AND COMMUNICATED WITH ITS LICENSEES AND STAKEHOLDERS AND COSUMERS REGARDING OVER NINETEEN. AND ACTUALLY EARLIER THIS YEAR THE BUREAU PROVIDED FAQS IN GENERAL GUIDANCE TO ITS LICENSEES AND THEN ALSO PASSED ALONG INFORMATION PUT OUT BY SISTER AGENCIES SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS THE APPRAISAL FOUNDATION. THE BUREAU ALL OFFERED LICENSEES EXTENDED TIME TO COMPLETE MOST OF THEIR CONTINUING EDUCATION COURSES AT THE PIER WAS ABLE TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT'S CONTINUING EDUCATION LAWS AND REGULATIONS WE ARE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS EXCEPT THE BUREAU HAS AN ADDITIONAL. EDUCATION COURSE I'M ONLY REFERRED TO AS A LAWS AND REGULATIONS FORCE. AND WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALLOWED FOR DETRIMENTS RENEWALS WITHOUT COMPLETING CONTINUING EDUCATION SO DID THE BUREAU SAID THEY JUST WENT IN LINE WITH THE FEDERAL AND WHAT THAT INDIVIDUAL FOR TOO MANY. HOWEVER THE BUREAU ALWAYS REQUIRED TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS FOR STREAMLINED COURSE- BECAUSE REALLY THAT SPECIFIC COURSES IN THE CALIFORNIA BOARD BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE AND THE BUREAU DID NOT RECEIVE A WAIVER- THEY'RE ACTUALLY EIGHT ZERO THAT. I'M DOES NOT FIT INTO THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT THEY COULDN'T RECEIVE ANY WAIVERS THROUGH THAT PROCESS. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON A FEW OF THEM ISSUES RAISED. AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH LEGISLATURE ON THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. AND AT THIS TIME WE ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE- REGARDING THE BUREAU AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME ON AND WORK ON THAT. DAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NUMBER OF ON TO ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CURRENTLY IN THE CHAMBERS AT THIS TIME I DEBATE ANY QUESTIONS FOR A FROM COUNTY MEMBERS AT THIS TIME CHECK LATER. THANK YOU DIRECTOR- I MUST SAY I STILL IT WAS CHALLENGING TO- TO HEAR YOUR TESTIMONY BUT I THINK I GOT. MOST OF IT- LOOK AT THIS THIS MOVE OF THE BUREAU- UNDER DCA IS A POINT OF- OF A PARTICULAR INTEREST. AND YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED AS TO WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO OR NOT. AND THE COSTS INVOLVED IN THE IN THE MOVE. AND THE EFFICIENCIES AND THE SERVICES. AND SO THERE THESE ARE LL. TIONS THAT ARE IN MY HEAD AND I ADMIT WE DON'T MAYBE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GET INTO ALL OF THEM HERE AND I HOPE THAT STAFF WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. BUT I AM INTERESTED IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE BENEFITS NOW TO- TO THE PREY THROUGH THE REAL ESTATE APPRAISAL COMMUNITY FOR THIS CHANGE IN THIS MOVE AND- OUR SERVICE IS BEING PROVIDED A HIGHER QUALITY NOW AND IF SO HOW SO- YOU KNOW WHAT MEASUREABLE BENEFITS ARE WE GETTING WHAT ARE THE ADDITIONAL COSTS THEY WERE INCURRING. AND ARE THEY REASONABLE. AND ARE THERE REALLY EFFICIENCIES AND WHAT ARE THAT. YOU'VE ADDRESSED A FEW OF THEM IN TERMS OF MOVING THE OFFICES AND- AND THINGS SUCH AS THAT BUT- I AM INTERESTED IN AND UNDERSTANDING MORE DEEPLY- THESE ISSUES THAT I'VE RAISED HERE WE WELCOMED IT TO ADDRESS THEM AS YOU SEE FIT NOW. BUT YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF IT ALSO THESE ARE THIS IS A BUREAU AND YOU SAY YOU WANT THEM TO BE AND EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE SO THIS IS NOT THE BEST NO I'M NOT TALKING TO SOMEONE FROM THE BUREAU. RIGHT SO. IT IS A- YEAH THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A CONFLICT THAT COMES INTO PLAY WOULD YOU SAY. AND ACTUALLY I DO HAVE SOMEONE FROM THE BUREAU AND THAT WILL ALSO BE RESPONDING. TO THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE AS WELL IF YOU WOULD LIKE- AND SO ONE THING I DO WANT TO SAY IS WHEN THEY- THE- HERO WAS ACTUALLY PART OF. THE OF THE DEPARTMENT THEY WERE ACTUALLY PAYING FOR ADMINISTRATIVE FEES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE SO CHANGING THEM OVER- EVEN TO THAT DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THEY STILL HAD TO PAY FEES SO. THAT WAS A TRANSITION SO EVEN IF THERE WAS A CHANGE TO ANOTHER AREA THEY WOULD STILL HAVE TO PAY FEES TO SOMEONE WHO PROVIDES THE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT. TO THE- BUREAU OF REAL ESTATE APPRAISERS NO MATTER WHERE THEY WERE SO DO YOU DO YOU WANT TO POINT THAT OUT IT WASN'T. ALTHOUGH THE FEES MAY HAVE INCREASED SOMEWHAT FOLLOWING FROM WHERE THEY #VIOUSLY DEPARTMENT THERE THOSE THOSE THINGS WOULD STILL HAVE TO CONTINUE BUT I AM ACTUALLY GONNA LET MYSTEEL IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION AS WELL ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED- BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASED EFFORT TO PROVIDE SERVICES. TO THE BUREAU I'M COMMENSURATE WITH. THE COST OF A PROGRAM. YEAH THE NEW REALLY OF THE EXPECTED TEAM CURRENTLY AT THE- OF. AFFAIRS REALLY HAS HOW CAN WE THE POOR AND BUREAUS PROVIDING SERVICE THAT. REALLY HAS BEEN A OF WITH MY OVER OKAY AS THE- DIRECT. AND REALLY THAT MEANS. FOR ME IT NEEDS CHANGING I'M REALLY A MINDSET OF. BASICALLY LOOKING AT- THAT YOU KNOW WHERE THIS OVERSIGHT AGENCY AND WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING. FOLLOWED AND REALLY SOMETIMES SAYING NO TO THE BOARDS AND GIRLS REALLY MORE TO LOOKING AT A TEAM RELATIONSHIP WORKING TOGETHER WHERE WE AND- THEY- MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO BE DONE THIS WAY BUT IS THERE ANOTHER PATHWAY. TO MEET THE GOAL OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO FOR THAT PARTICULAR ITEM. AND OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK. ON SEVERAL OF THOSE AREAS AND. IT WILL BE AN ONGOING. GOAL FOR US HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE TO IN THOSE SERVICES BUT I WILL LET DELLA I'M BECAUSE- ON SERVICES OF OUR- I'M WE WILL GET BACK TO SENATOR WITH THE- COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF. YOU KNOW WITH THE FINE OF WHAT IT WAS PREVIOUSLY IN WHAT IS NOW- AND AGAIN ALL OF THE SERVICES YOU KNOW THAT WE DO PROVIDING. ISSUES OR SURROUNDING HUMAN RESOURCES- BUDGETING- PERSONNEL ACTIONS WHEN WE TAKE THEM AS WELL AS- CONTRACTING AND ALL OF THAT PROCESS WHICH AGAIN WAS PROVIDED. BY THE DEPARTMENT BEFORE THEY MOVED IN HAVE A FEW. BUT MISTER ONE I WILL. ALLOW HER TO. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES FOUR OKAY THANK YOU- TO ANSWER THE QUESTION I MEAN DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS PROVIDES A VALUABLE SERVICE TO US- THE SERVICES MANY OF THE SERVICES HAVE IMPROVED OVER THE FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN WITH THE BUREAU- AS- THIS KIRSCHNER SAID THERE'S- CERTAINLY ROOM FOR. ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS- I CANNOT REALLY SPEAK TO THE SERVICES THAT WE RECEIVED UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE I WAS NOT- AROUND AT THAT TIME SO MY ENTIRE TENURE HAS BEEN UNDER CONSUMER FAIRS- SO. I THINK THAT'S I'M NOT SURE THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION. WELL AT FIRST THANK YOU BOTH THE DIRECTOR INTO YOU- FOR ENGAGING. THESE CONVERSATIONS CAN CONTINUE- YOU KNOW THERE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SUBSTANTIAL FEE INCREASES. AND- THOSE THAT ALWAYS. PROMOTE A DEEPER REVIEW OF- THE SERVICES PROVIDED AND EFFICIENCIES OR LACK THERE OF TO SO EVERYBODY CAN BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE- THE ENGAGEMENT AS I SAID TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS.

I HEARD PART OF THE QUESTION THE BEGINNING PART WHICH IS HOW IS THE INDUSTRY REACTED TO THE REFINANCE INCREASE- I HEARD PART OF THIS BY BELIEVED TO BE A SECOND PART THE QUESTION. ABOUT LOCAL EXPERTISE- REGARDING HOW THE INDUSTRY IS REACTING- I CAN'T SPEAK TOO MUCH FOR THE INDUSTRY- AS WE REGULATE APPRAISERS AND APPRAISAL MANAGEMENT COMPANIES- I AM AWARE OF THE INCREASED- AND LIKELY MARKET FORCES ARE ASSISTING AND- GETTING INCREASE SERVICES WHERE POSSIBLE OF FOR LOCAL EXPERTISE. APPRAISERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE- THAT LOCAL KNOWLEDGE WHEN THEY ARE DOING THEIR APPRAISALS- SO THAT SHOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE BUT AGAIN I MISSED PROBABLY THE LAST HALF OF THE QUESTION. IN THE SECOND HALF OR THIRD HALF THAT. PORTION OF THAT QUESTION IS THE FACT THAT DIVERSITY IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW D. BOARD LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE THAT COME INTO THEIR GENERAL AREAS THAT FEEL THAT THEY HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE COMMUNITY AND- BATCH IMPORTANT AND THAT'S THAT I'M I GUESS I'M ADDRESSING YOUR OUTREACH PROGRAM TO. BRING PEOPLE IN FROM THE COMMUNITIES- TO PARTICIPATE AND BECOME A LICENSED APPRAISERS. YES THERE ARE- TRADITIONALLY IT IS A SUPERVISOR TRAINEE RELATIONSHIP WHICH GETS NEW BLOOD INTO THE INDUSTRY- WERE EXCITED ABOUT AND A NEW PROGRAM. THAT'S ACTUALLY BEING ROLLED OUT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. W. FOR DISAFFECTED AND- THAT IS GOING TO TAKE- A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO GAINING EXPERIENCE WHICH AGAIN IS CURRENTLY ONLY- GAINED. THROUGH GOING OUT TYPICALLY WITH THE SUPERVISOR AND GAIN EXPERIENCE NOW. WITH A NEW TYPE OF EXPERIENCE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ARCHULETA ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME AGAIN. AGAIN AT ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM ANY ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. OKAY IT IS HEARING NONE I DO HAD. HAVE A QUESTION SPECIFICALLY. TO DIRECTOR KURT MEYER AND IT'S AGAIN BEEN BROUGHT UP EARLIER WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFICALLY ON ISSUE NUMBER SIX WITH THAT SPECIFICALLY OF FEE INCREASES BECAUSE WE HAVE THE PLEASURE OF HAVING YOU JOIN US AS A DIRECTOR YOU'RE WELL AWARE AND FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT THE LEGISLATURE RECENTLY APPROVED INCREASED FEES ACROSS A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL ENTITIES THIS PAST LEGISLATIVE SESSION. MUCH TO OUR ANGST ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COVERT PANDEMIC. I WANTED TO GET SOME OF YOUR INSIGHTS SPECIFICALLY AROUND THAT. THE CONVERSATION ABOUT. WHAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED BEFORE US ON THE POTENTIAL INSOLVENCY. OF THE BUREAU- SPECIFICALLY AND THE NEED TO INCREASE FEES. AND YET THE CONVERSATION CONCLUDING AROUND TO SIMPLY INCREASING FEES VERSUS THAT OF A CONVERSATION AROUND CONSOLIDATION OR ANY OTHER AVENUES TO JUSTIFY THE INCREASED BENEFITS SPECIFICALLY DURING A COVERED PANDEMIC MY TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS TO THE FACT THAT. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RESERVATION ON CONTINUALLY INCREASING FEES TIME AND TIME AGAIN WITHOUT A CLEAR SPECIFIC ARTICULATION OF AN INCREASE BENEFIT AND OR- THE DIRECTION TO FOCUS ON CONSOLIDATION OR ALTERNATIVE METHODS. AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW FOR THAT QUESTION- THIS IS AN ISSUE- AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THAT WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT- AMONGST OURSELVES. AND SOME OF THE THINGS PARTICULARLY WITH THIS BUREAU THAT THAT WE HAVE WORK THAT IS FINDING WAYS WHERE WE CAN ASSESS THE BUREAU- AND FROM A FROM THE TCA'S PERSPECTIVE- ONE AREAS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WHERE WE'VE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THAT AT I'M AT THE ABILITY TO CONSOLIDATE SERVERS AND I KNOW THAT MAY SEEM. MINOR BUT EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHERE AREAS TO CONSOLIDATE IT- AND TO LOWER COSTS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE WITH THAT IS THEY ARE ALSO LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY- THREE FIFTEEN I'M MORE- STAFF. MEMBERS FOR THAT. YOU'RE ALSO THAT WOULD HELP WITH THEIR EXT. I'M I IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I OF REALIZE- THAT. THE FEES A LOT OF THIS WITH THE FEE INCREASES IS JUST THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS. AND I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER IN MY TALKING POINTS THE ISSUE OF HOW IT HAS INCREASED- A BASED ON EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND THERE HAVE BEEN INCREASES AND- DOES IT OVER THE YEARS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AS TO WHERE YOU HAD IN THE EARLY. REALLY IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND AND IN THOSE AREAS ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL PROBABLY ALMOST TWO THOUSAND. FOURTEEN WE COULD NOT SEE THOSE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION INCREASES AND SO THAT HAS REALLY IMPACTED- NOT JUST ONLY THAT HERO. BUT IT ALSO HAS IMPACTED I'M STATEWIDE EMPLOYEES SO YOU HAVE ALSO IMPACTED THE DEPARTMENT RIGHT THERE'S EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS- STATEWIDE. EMPLOYMENT AT AGENCIES SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STATE. COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES SO WHEN YOU HAVE AN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION INCREASES NOT ONLY IMPACT THAT THAT SPECIFIC VERO BUT THE IMPACT ALL THE WAY THROUGH- TO DISOBEY PROBLEMATIC. APPS AND STATE WIDE PROGRAM AT F. AND M. I JUST YES I WOULD I WOULD LIKEN IT TO- WHERE WE WERE FIVE YEARS AGO MAYBE WHEN YOU. WENT OUT TO A RESTAURANT AND YOU ACTUALLY PAY THE BILLS THAT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT I WOULD STAY WHERE IT IS TODAY. BECAUSE AS WE'VE ALSO RAISED A MINIMUM WAGE FOR EXAMPLE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS IT'S NOT JUST THE SERVER THAT YOU'RE INCREASING THEIR FEES AND IT'S NOT JUST THE- ACTUAL. HOPE THAT MAYBE LOOKING YOUR MAIL THAT ALSO INCREASE BUT ALSO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO BROUGHT ME TO THE NEAREST RESTAURANT BUT IT'S ALSO THAT INDIVIDUAL FRIEDMAN PRODUCE SELF. IT WAS IT IF ALL OF THAT MEANS YOU HAVE A EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION INCREASE IN IMPACT ALL OF THAT ENHANCE THERE'S JUST AN INCREASE. TO LOOKING AT- REALLY THOSE THOSE BE INCREASES SO THAT IT'S- IT BUT THING INCREASE THE ALWAYS. THAT WE WANT TO AT LAW THE FOR THING WE WANT TO AT IT AS ARE THERE IF. WE CAN. WILL BE THERE TO. IN THE WAY DO THIS SUCH AND FROM THE TECHNOLOGY ARE THE MORE THAT WE PUT ON. SO WE ARE AND- SYSTEM ACTUALLY- PROCESS OF THE OUTPUT. AND THERE'S NOT AS MUCH INFO WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE. I'M ARE THERE OTHER WAY THAT WE CAN FIND AND FISHING. IN HOW WE IN FOR- ARE THERE. EVEN FOR. THAT WE CAN- THAT INDIVIDUAL DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A LOOK HARPER AND THEY'RE GOING UP WHEN THAT'S THE- THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A DEPARTMENT WIDE NOT JUST FOR THE BUREAU BUT- I'M JUST. THERE FOR THE ONES AT THAT WHERE WE CAN FIND EFFICIENCIES THAT CUT DOWN ON THE PROCESS- AS WELL AS- MAKING THAT. IS THE LAST THING I DO HAVE TO SAY IT YES ONE OF THOSE THINGS FOR THE SMALLER BUREAUS IMPORTS THAT IS GREAT ARE IMPACTED WHEN YOU DO HAVE THE LOWER- PAUL YOUNG OF LICENSE FEES AND WE SEE THIS ALSO ACTUALLY IN THE BORDER PUT YES. THAT WOULD BE AFTER MEDICAL BOARD WE ALSO SEE THIS WITH THE PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARY PAYROLLS- WE ARE THERE ANY HAVE HIGHER- ACTUALLY LICENSING FEES BECAUSE THE LOWER. WITH EACH OKAY THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO HELP THEM FIND WAYS WHERE WE CAN- PROVIDE THEM THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED TO TRY TO PEOPLE UP. FOR THANK YOU THERE ARE A- I I'VE- THE- EXPLANATION WERE. TO THE JUDGE THE- ON FEEDING. OF AND- WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING YOU HERE TO HAVE A- HAVE YOU HERE AND HAVE DIALOGUE. THIS AS YOU KNOW I. HAVE SIR IN DIFFICULT. TO FEED THESE BOARDS COME BACK NOW FOR THE FALL SUNSETS. AND MINIMIZE EXPERIENCE. IT SUCH THAT. THE CONCLUSION YOU'VE ARTICULATED THAT IT'S NOT BUT THE FEW CREASE IS NOT THE FIRST ROUTE. BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE. IT SEEMS TO BE THAT WE STILL CONCLUDE AND MAKE THE DECISION THAT THERE IS A FEE INCREASE FOR A NUMBER OF THESE ENTITIES A NUMBER THESE BOARDS. AND THE QUESTION AGAIN IT OUTLINED. IN PREPARATION OF THIS IN ISSUE NUMBER SIX IS THAT. WHAT IS THE JUSTIFICATION IT IS THERE AN INCREASED WORKLOAD SPECIFICALLY. TO JUSTIFY AN INCREASE OF FIFTEEN CREE. AND THAT'S WHERE WE LOOK AT WE HAD WE COULDN'T DO AT THE INCREASE THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING TO YOUR I'M FORTY INCREASED IN- STATUTORY- THE ABILITY TO INCREASE FEES WE REALLY HAVE TO DO WITH THE STUDY WHERE THAT COMES DIçN AND A LOOK AT WHAT IT'S ASKING TO DO THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE PROVIDING FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND- JUST TO THE POINT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW TO THE- IMPACT OF. INCREASES AS FAR AS- YOU KNOW COMING. I SAY FOR THIS PARTICULAR BUREAU YOU KNOW THE HADN'T REYES AND FEES FOR A SIX. AMOUNT OF TIME BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOWER. AND- IT WASN'T THAT THE PROPERTIES AT TO WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE AND SO I THINK IT WAS INTO EIGHTEEN AND THAT THEY BROUGHT THEM UP TO WHERE THEY COULD BE IMPARTED TO THEM BEING REDUCED. AND THEN THEY BROUGHT THEM FORWARD IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWENTY- TO RAISE THEM UP TO THEIR- MORE TOWARDS THEIR STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. SO I DIDN'T GET IT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME FOR THIS ZERO- FOR THEM TO INCREASE THEIR FEES. AND THAT AGAIN IS WHAT WE LOOK AT- EIGHT I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO LOOK AT. WHAT HAS BEEN INCREASED IN MAY BE MANDATORY ISSUES FOR THE- BOARDS OF GIRLS TO LOOK AT SO HAS THERE BEEN THAT- BILL THAT HAS PASSED. OR MAYBE THEY NEED TO DO MORE. MORE APT. AND SO HAVE TO AT THAT BUT THAT IS WHOLE. FOR DOING A FEE ON THAT STUDY FOR THE BOARD TO SET. WHERE THOSE THINGS ARE FROM AND WE WILL DIE. GO BACKFOR THIS PARTICULAR BUREAU AND PROVIDE THE INFORMATION AND- I'M ESTO WHAT IMPACT. REQUIREMENT FOR THIS. SO AGAIN I DID SPECIFICALLY IT THE ANSWER THE QUESTION IT HAS THERE BEEN AN INCREASE IN WORKLOAD. AND FOR THIS PARTICULAR BOARD I DON'T BELIEVE SO BECAUSE OUR BUREAU I NEED THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A DEEP LYING AND- THEIR ACTUAL- LICENSURE AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE IF I REMEMBER LOOKING. ENFORCEMENT DATE I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S AN INCREASE A PRETTY STAYED PRETTY STEADY ON THEIR ENFORCEMENT AND THE INFORMATION THAT WAS COMING AND THAT. ON DATA THAT HAS BEEN COMING IN FROM OUR COMPANY THANKS DAD STATE STEADY EVEN THOUGH THE LICENSES- HAS ACTUALLY GONE. OKAY THOSE THE SPECIFIC ANSWER FROM YOU IS THAT THERE IS NOT. AN INCREASE IN WORKLOAD AND AG AGAIN YOU WE'VE WE'VE OUTLINED HERE THAT OF. THE DECREASING LICENSEE POPULATION. SO ON THE SURFACE ONE COULD SAY IT'S OFF A COUNTER. INTUITIVE TO INCREASE. THE FEES FOR A DECREASING THE LICENSEE POPULATION AND PERHAPS WE MIGHT LOOK AT CONSOLIDATION AS AGAIN ADDRESSED IN ISSUE NUMBER SIX. VERSES THAT OF. DEFAULTING TO FEE INCREASES TO WHICH I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE DEAL WITH ALSO IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES IS SOMETIMES THE STATE BUREAUCRACY CANNOT SEEM IN TOUCH WITH THAT OF THE REALITIES THAT EXIST WITH EVERYDAY HARD WORKING PEOPLE. AND THAT WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT OR EVEN THE CONVERSATION AROUND FEE INCREASES A SIGNIFICANT FRUSTRATION THAT GOVERNMENT IS NOT WORKING FOR PEOPLE AND THAT I THINK IS PART OF THE DUTY THAT WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AND WORKING WITH YOU AND WORKING WITH OUR LICENSEES TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE. EFFECTIVE AND THAT WERE WORKING TO SERVE THE LICENSEE POPULATION. AND AGAIN THE FRUSTRATION BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING YOU IS THAT. ESPECIALLY IN THIS CLIMATE. IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE SPEECH INCREASES. GIVEN THE CLIMATE AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AGAIN WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE CAN TELL THEY WORK TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE AS EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE AND ESPECIALLY FOR NOT ARTICULATING AND ENHANCED TO BENEFIT OR VALUE. I THINK IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US THEN TO LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES TO. EFFECTUATE CHANGE IN A POSITIVE FASHION AND NOT TO PUT THE BURDEN ON THAT OF THE LICENSEES- BUT AGAIN I KNOW THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONVERSATIONS. BUT I WOULD JUST URGE YOU TO ASSIST US IN COLLABORATION AND ENSURING THAT WE ACTUALLY. COME TO THAT CONCLUSION BECAUSE THUS FAR MY EXPERIENCE. WE CONTINUALLY SEEK INCREASES AND LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES HAVE CONTINUOUSLY SHARED THEIR RESERVATIONS. IN IN SIMILAR. CONVERSATION AS WELL SO. I HOPE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES MOVING FORWARD AND AGAIN THAT WAS ON ISSUE NUMBER SIX THAT WE'VE HAD. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WILL NOW MOVE ON TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. OPERATOR WOULD YOU KINDLY OPEN UP THE LINE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO. PROVIDE ANY TESTIMONY AT THIS TIME. SURE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT PRESS ONE THEN ZERO NOW AGAIN ONE THEN ZERO TO COMMENT VIA THE PHONE. THE YOU HAVE ONE I'LL BE JUST A MOMENT. AND AS A REMINDER ONE THEN ZERO TWO COMMENTS. IN THE YEAR LOCAL TO LINE IF TEAM PLEASE GO AHEAD. KEVIN GLAZER AND TERMINAL- THIS IS MIKE BELOW ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE APPRAISAL INSTITUTE I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR DILIGENCE ON THE SUNSET REVIEW EFFORT AND COMPLEMENT THE STAFF FOR A VERY THOROUGH REPORT. I'D LIKE TO- PASS A COMPLIMENT DIRECTOR KIRK MYERS SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN OPEN ACCESSIBLE AND FORTHRIGHT WITH US AND WE APPRECIATE. THERE IS BOTH A LONG TERM AND SHORT TERM ISSUE THOUGH CONCERNING THE BUREAU OF REAL ESTATE APPRAISERS. STRUCK THERE'S A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM THAT THREATENS TO BECOME A DEATH SPIRAL FOR THE BUREAU- WHEN CREATED IN NINETEEN NINETY AND CONTINUOUSLY SENDS. APPRAISERS ARE LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE COUNTRY ONLY TO PERFORM WHAT ARE KNOWN AS FEDERALLY RELATED APPRAISALS. THOSE ARE GENERALLY LOANS MADE BY FEDERALLY REGULATED LENDERS IF I LOAN MONEY TO A NEIGHBOR FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS NOT A FEDERALLY RELATED TRANSACTIONS. THE APPRAISAL CAN BE PERFORMED BY ANYONE- WITH- WITHOUT A LICENSE AND WITHOUT ANY PARTICULAR STANDARDS. THE GROWTH IN APPRAISAL OVER THE THIRTY YEARS SINCE WE'VE CREATED THIS LAW HAS BEEN IN NON FEDERALLY RELATED TRANSACTIONS THINGS LIKE. THAT EXPERT WITNESS OR PORTFOLIO REVIEW- ALSO ATTENTION OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT GENERALLY RELATED AND THEREFORE DO NOT REQUIRE A LICENSE. THAT IS PART OF THE REASON FOR THE DECLINE IN LICENSING NUMBERS THE OTHER MAJOR REASON IS THE INCREASED USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND VALUING REAL ESTATE- THAT THAT IS A TREND THAT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE. THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT LICENSE THE NUMBERS WILL INCREASE SO YOU YOU REALLY RUN INTO THIS POTENTIAL OF A REGULATORY SPIRAL WHERE FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE ARE PAYING MORE AND MORE. FOR THEIR LICENSES WHICH WILL CREATE A DISINCENTIVE TO HELP ONE. AND THAT'S A LONG TERM STRUCTURAL ISSUE THAT I REALLY. THANK NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. THERE'S ALSO A SHORT TERM ISSUE ON SEASON WE APPRECIATE- THE BOTH CHAIRS QUESTIONS AND- AND PROBING ON THIS POINT. IN FACT APPRAISAL LICENSE FEES ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT- THE THREE NOW FOR A RENEWAL OF THE GENERAL CERTIFICATE IS A THOUSAND AND THIRTY DOLLARS- IT IS HIGHER IS AGAIN I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON EVERY PROFESSIONAL THREE IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S HIGHER THAN LAWYERS FOR EXAMPLE- IT IS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL FEE. AND ADDITIONALLY- BUILDING I'M NOT AT ALL SURE- AND WE'VE TALKED TO THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THIS IN THE BUREAU BUT I'M NOT AT ALL SURE THAT THE FEES. BEING ASSESSED TO LICENSEES. ARE AUTHORIZED BY THE STATUTE- A LICENSE AS I INDICATED PAYS A THOUSAND AND THIRTY DOLLARS. FOR A RENEWAL THE LICENSING FEE CHART INDICATES THAT THAT IS A COMBINATION OF AN APPLICATION REVIEW SEE AN ISSUE AND SPREE AND VARIOUS REGISTRATION FEES- THERE IS NOTHING IN THE STATUTE THAT AUTHORIZES AN APPLICATION REVIEW FEE AT IT AND IN FACT THAT FEE WAS INCREASED FROM ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS TO FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS RECENTLY. AGAIN WITHOUT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL ANY STATUTORY AUTHORITY WHATEVER IF YOU LOOK AT B. AND T. SECTION ELEVEN FOUR OH FIVE IT SAYS THAT THE C. FOR ORIGINAL OR RENEWAL CERTIFICATION IS FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS- AND THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE LICENSING FEE CHART BUT THERE IS NO STATUTE THAT SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT AN APPLICATION REVIEW THREE. SO WE BROUGHT THAT UP WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND THE BUREAU THEY ASSURED US THAT IT WAS AUTHORIZED BY LAW BUT WE DON'T SEE WHERE THAT IS. AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S BOTH A SHORT TERM CLARIFICATION THAT WE ARE REQUESTING AND THEN A LONG TERM NEED TO LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE OF THE REGULATORY PROGRAM BECAUSE YOU THERE IS NO REASON TO EXPECT A- A REBOUND IN LICENSING NUMBERS. AND SO THE FEE WILL JUST CONTINUE TO GO UP FOR FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AGAIN WE APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO IT AND KNOW THAT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF A DIALOGUE. BUT THAT LACK OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY IS A MATTER OF QUITE SOME CONCERN FOR OUR MEMBERS. I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THE YOU VERY MUCH MY BELOW. OPERATOR WOULD YOU KINDLY OPEN OF THE LINE FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK ASK A QUESTION OR COMMENT AT THIS TIME. YEP AND AS A REMINDER IF YOU DO HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT YOU CAN PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AGAIN ONE THEN ZERO THE QUESTION OR COMMENT. AND WE'RE SHOWING NO ONE AND TWO AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME AS WE CONCLUDE. THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING SPECIFICALLY. ANY MEMBERS WHO ARE JOINING US REMOTELY ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. OKAY HEARING THEN THEN THAT'LL CONCLUDE OUR HEARING ON THE BUREAU OF REAL ESTATE APPRAISERS WE THANK THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED AGAIN AS WILL CONTINUE TO FLUSH OUT ADDITIONAL OUTSTANDING ISSUES AS WE MOVE FORWARD AGAIN TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THIS IS A TRANSPARENT PROCESS TO WHICH WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF PUBLIC MEETINGS TO ENSURETHE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND INPUT. AS WE LOOK TO ENSURE TO ADDRESS MANY OF THESE OUTSTANDING ISSUES AS WE HEAD INTO THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION- WELL NOW- IF THERE'S NO OTHER COMMENTS HERE IN THE IN THE CHAMBERS- THAT WILL CONCLUDE OUR OVERSIGHT HEARING THANK YOU.
