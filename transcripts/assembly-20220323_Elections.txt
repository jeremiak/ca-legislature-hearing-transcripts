PART OF THE ON TIME CAUCUS WOULD LOVE TO SEE. WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB TWENTY THIRTY WILL PUT VOTERS FIRST BY REMOVING THE INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST WHEN BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ARE INVOLVED IN DECISIONS AND REDRAWING POLITICAL DISTRICT LINES. AB TWENTY THIRTY WILL ESTABLISH THE COUNTY OF FRESNO CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COME TO DRAW DISK BOUNDARIES FOR THE FOR COUNTY OF SUPERVISORS. GERRYMANDERING ALLOWS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES TO CHOOSE THE VOTERS IN THEIR DISTRICTS RATHER THAN ALLOWING VOTERS TO ELECT THEIR REPRESENTATIVES IN A FAIR AND LAWFUL. XIN THE PRACTICE OF GERRYMANDERING HAS DISENFRANCHISED UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES INCLUDING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND DILUTED THEIR VOTING POWER. MAPS WHICH WERE DRAWN BY LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS WHICH TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE GROWING DEMOGRAPHICS OF LATINO COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS REFLECTED BY THE CENSUS WAS STRUCK DOWN BY THE FRESNO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. THE DISTRICT MAP WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE FRESNO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WAS MET WITH WIDESPREAD LOCAL OPPOSITION. THE CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION WILL PUT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DRAWING POLITICAL MAPS IN THE HANDS OF AN INDEPENDENT GROUP OF FRESNO COUNTY VOTERS ENSURING THAT THE VOICES IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE HEARD. I WILL HAVE TO WITNESSES HERE FOR AB TWENTY THIRTY. FIRST WE WILL HAVE TO LOTUS WORKED OUT WHO'S REPRESENTING THE HUERTA FOUNDATION AND NEXT WE WILL HAVE DORA ROSE WHO WILL BE REPRESENTING THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SO ARAMBULA WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES ON THIS BILL BOTH BY PHONE. THE FIRST WITNESSES MENTIONED IS DELORES WORKED WITH THE DIVORCE WHERE THE FOUNDATION IS WORTH THE YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THAT YET THIS. CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT THE RIGHT NOW. IN THE WORLD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY. ABOUT PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO CHOOSE THEIR LEADERS MUST BE ABLE TO HAPPENING IN UKRAINE. OTHER PEOPLE ARE BEING MURDERED- BECAUSE THE- THE BEST ONE TO TAKE OVER THEIR COUNTRY. AND WANT TO REPRESENT THEM. WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR OF COURSE ON A DIFFERENT SCALE. THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE THEIR REPRESENTATIVES. BUT THE WAYS THAT THE BIRDS TO PROVIDE DECLINED BY THIRTY ONE UNFORTUNATELY- THAT IS A DOES NOT HAVE THE DESIRED. BUT PEOPLE TEND TO SEVEN BUT- OF PROBABLY KNOWS THE IN THE COMMITTEE. OF BURKE A CLIENT OF MAPS. PUT THAT THIS LEVEL. WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO THE- COMMITTEE. ANTICIPATED PLEASE PLEASE GIVE US A OF THE- TO OUR PREP. AT PUTS THE LEVEL BECAUSE THE VERY IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE THERE THE ONES THAT. THE BONTA COME LOOK UP THE STATE GOVERNMENT IS HAVE SEEN AND THE BOOK UNCLE THAT. SO AT THIS IS A REALLY. I WOULD LIKE PAY NOTHER TAX BUT AMONG FEE M. COMMITTEE PROTECT THE- I PUT ON THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RYAN MEMBERS I'M SORRY I CAN'T BE WITH YOU PERSONALLY TODAY AND I'M VERY HONORED TO BE ON THE SAME PODIUM SO TO SPEAK WITH WITH. THIS CHARACTER. I'M DAUGHTER ROSE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA I THINK YOU KNOW WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT GERRYMANDERING SIMPLY HAS ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE IN OUR DEMOCRACY AT ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. RIGHT UNDERMINE THEIR POLITICAL SYSTEMS CORE IDEALS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO STATE AND CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING CALIFORNIA'S AHEAD OF THE CURVE IN REJECTING GERRYMANDERING. OUR STATE INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING PROCESS WHICH PROHIBITS INCUMBENTS WITH ELECTORAL SELF INTEREST IN DRAWING DISTRICT LINES IS CONSIDERED THE NATIONAL GOLD STANDARD WE'RE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB THERE. AB TWENTY THIRTY EXTEND THAT PRACTICE DIFFERENCE NO COUNTY. SO LIKE THE STATE COMMISSION THE BILL REQUIRES COMMISSIONERS TO MEET STRICT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE PROHIBITS REACHING CANDIDATES AND LOBBYISTS FROM SERVING ON THE COMMISSION. IT CREATES A RANDOM SELECTION PROCESS TO ENSURE THE COMMISSIONERS ARE NOT BEHOLDEN TO ANY ELECTED OFFICIAL. IT REQUIRED THE COUNTY TO TAKE A VERY. STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THE COMMISSION REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITY SUPER IMPORTANT. AND THE BILL BELIEVES VERY ROBUST MEANINGFUL ELEMENTS. OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. BY ENSURE THAT THE ACT TRANSFER. AND ALSO MOST HEARING BEFORE NO ADOPTION IT ALSO IS ALSO. A QUITE. EXPLICITLY PARTISAN PRONE JOE MANDER WHICH NEEDS. R. IF. IMPORTANT IN FRESNO COUNTY WHERE PUBLIC TESTIMONY AS NETWORKS ARE POINTED OUT WAS LARGELY DISREGARDED IN THE REGION REDISTRICTING PROCESS AND THE RESULTING MAP. WHICH IS SHIFTED VERY LITTLE IN DECADES DOESN'T COME CLOSE TO REFLECTING VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COUNTY'S DEMOGRAPHICS SO. THE RESULT IS REALLY ONE THAT. WE SHOULD ALL OF CORK RIGHT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND FRESNO COUNTY REMAIN. UNDERREPRESENTED IN COUNTY GOVERNMENT THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA'S URGES AN AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY THIRTY TO BRING INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING THE FRESNO COUNTY AND TO ENSURE THAT ITS GOVERNMENT TRULY REPRESENTS THE INTERESTS OF. ALL ITS RESIDENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS ROSE. NINE WE DON'T HAVE ANY PRIME WITNESS IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL.

SIMILAR TO THE THREE PROPOSED MAPS SUBMITTED. BY VARIOUS LOCAL GROUPS. AND HAS A POPULATION DEVIATION OF ONE POINT FOUR EIGHT PERCENT. IN ADDITION THE ADOPTED SUPERMAJORITY DISTRICT BOUNDARY MAP. COMPLIES WITH THE FEDERAL VOTING RIGHTS ACT. THE U. S. IN CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONS. IS CONTIGUOUS AND TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE KEEPS COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST CITIES AND CENSUS DURIN DESIGNATED PLACES. UNDIVIDED THE MAP ALSO HAS EASILY IDENTIFIABLE BOUNDARIES. EXTENT PRACTICABLE.

MISPRINT JUST WEST OF I'M TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY JUST BECAUSE IN FACT YOU ARE A REPRESENT A FROM FRESNO I'M JUST GONNA TRUST THAT THIS IS NOT A LOCAL ISSUE BUT I HAVE SOME DEEP CONCERNS I WANT TO MAKE SURE TO SHARE- SHARE THEM- I'M A LITTLE KID THIS ONLY APPLIES FRESNO COUNTY- IF IT'S A POLICY THAT'S A GOOD POLICY- THAT IT SHOULD APPLY TO EVERY CAN OF COFFEE COUNTIES IN IN THE STATE. COUNTY CHARTER CAN ARE BEGINNING TAKE MORE MORE POWER AWAY FROM A CHARTER COUNTIES IN MAKING LOOK MUCH MORE LIKE GENERAL LAW COUNTIES. WITH THERE BEING A PURPOSE FOR THEM TO BE A TO BE TO BE CHARTER COUNTIES- AND THEN JUST MAYBE THE QUESTION IS WHY DOES THIS ONLY APPLY TO FRESNO COUNTY AND WHY AREN'T WE KNOW THAT THERE'S- SAM YOU KNOW COUNTY. ASSEMBLY ST OKAY. A COUPLE OF. DAYS AS WELL AS- BRITISCHEN COMMITTEE ONE APPLY THIS STATE- INSTEAD OF.JUST JUST TO THE COUNTIES ARE SOME SPECIFIC INSTANCE OF. OF ABUSE IN IN FRESNO THAT YOU'RE ADDRESSING WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE CONCERN. I I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE BILL THAT WOULD COVER THIS FOR ALL COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE I BELIEVE THAT BILL HAS GOTTEN. TO THE GOVERNOR AND DID NOT GET HIS SIGNATURE. AND SO UNTIL THAT TIME I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO GO HELLO. COUNTY IN TWO WE CAN- CHAU A CRITICAL MASS OF CAPIZ THAT WOULD LEAD TOWARDS US TO ASSESS THE STATE. BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THAT OVERALL LIFE I THINK ALL COUNTY SHOULD REMOVE JERRY MAN. AND THERE'S JUST AN INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST HERE. THAT BELIEVE FOR DROPPING TO AN ACID. IT'S NOT. SB DOESN'T COUNTY BY WHAT HAVE IN PRESS COUNTY WAS AGREE. THIS LAST CYCLE WHERE THEY WERE NOT. HEARING AND LISTENING TO A COMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO ADDRESS WITH MY BILL BUT HE EAGERLY ANTICIPATES THE BILL THAT WOULD. DO THIS FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL. THE SEATTLE I SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT- MY COLLEAGUE FROM BACK. HAS ON THIS HAS SOME OF IT IS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SINGLING OUT ONE JURISDICTION FOR THE STATE TO APPLY THEIR POWER OVER AND- YOU KNOW YOU A FRESNO I THINK- IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR HISTORY- DATE FRESNO COUNTY IS ACTUALLY DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF WITH THEIR REDISTRICTING AS IT IS. AND IT. RENDERING IS CONCERNED I DON'T THINK THAT DISAPPEARS WITH A CITIZEN COMMISSION- HE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO SOME OF OUR DISTRICTS IN THIS LAST. THIS LAST GO ROUND- THERE'S SOME PRETTY INTERESTING BOUNDARIES SO- GIVEN. THAT AT LOOKING AT FRESNO I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE GOING TO THAT PICK ON FRESNO. AND ERODING THAT LOCAL CONTROL FOR THOSE PEOPLE IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT THEN THEY SHOULD GET A GET A REFERENDUM AND MAKE THAT MOVE IF ENOUGH OF THEM SUPPORT THAT AND THAT WILL HAPPEN. IN FRESNO COUNTY- BUT LACKING THAT A I KIND OF I FEEL LIKE THERE'S TOO MUCH STATE OVER REACH AND A LOT OF OUR LOCAL ISSUES. AND I THINK- YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT AND A OF SAME- AT MY REPERTOIRE THE REPRESENT FROM THE DESERT HAS SAID- YOU KNOW I REALLY KIND OF STRUGGLE WITH THESE. THESE AND OTHERS LIKE IT AND I WILL PROBABLY REMAIN CONSISTENT IN MY VOTING- AS I DID WITH THE OTHER COUNTY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO READ THE COMMENTS OR CONCERNS LEE MICHAELS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE THE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING HALF OF FRESNO COUNTY IT REPRESENTING THE HALF THAT- HOLDS MOST OF OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WE OFTENTIMES DON'T FEEL LIKE OUR VOICES HEARD I BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL GIVE US HOPE AND OPTIMISM THAT DEMOCRACY IS ALIVE AND FRESNO COUNTY I'M GLAD TO STAND WITH PEOPLE LIKE THE LOTUS WORK DONE DOOR OF ROSE.

ALL MAKE THE SHORT THAT I THINK YOU CHAIRED MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE STAFF FOR EFFORTS ON THIS BILL- THIS IS A GREAT BILL AND I'M REALLY EXCITED WHERE WE ENDED UP AT HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN WHICH WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL VOTING LOCATIONS TO CALIFORNIA VOTERS BY AUTHORIZED BY AUTHORIZING COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS TO HAVE THE OPTION OF UTILIZING VENUES THAT HAVE BARS OR SELL ALCOHOL TO SERVE AS VOTING LOCATIONS. THIS WOULD MAKE IT THE EXEMPTION MADE ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE I RECALL ELECTIONS A PERMANENT. FOR FUTURE- ELECTIONS EACH YEAR COUNTY. ELECTION OFFICIALS SEARCH. FOR APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS FURTHER VOTERS. AND LOCATIONS LIKE BARS AND RESTAURANTS ARE. A LAST RESORT FOR ELECTION OFFICIALS BECAUSE- THEIR DISRUPTIVE TO VOTERS. THE GOAL IS TO. HAVE AN ACCESSIBLE QUITE MONNING VIOLENT FOR ALL VOTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU WE HAVE A ONE PRIMARY WITH US ON THIS BILLS PARTICIPATING BY PHONE RYAN ROCK YES THE PRIMARY WITNESSES RUN AROUND GO WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS AND ELECTION OFFICIALS MISTER ROCKLEY OF TWO MINUTES PLEASE GO AHEAD.

WE'RE PLEASED TO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT AB TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN I LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBERS FLOOR AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIRIMPORTANT WORK ON THIS BILL- DURING THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION FOR ALL OF LAST YEAR INCLUDING. THE SEPTEMBER GUBERNATORIAL RECALL ELECTION. COUNTIES WERE ALLOWED BY YOUR LEGISLATURE THE TEMPORARY ABOUT THE USE COMMUNITY CENTERS VETERANS HALLS BANQUET ROOMS AND LODGES. LOCATIONS WHERE WE HAVE AVOID APPROACHING IN THE PAST BECAUSE THEY WERE ALSO PLACES WHERE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES WERE SOLD. AB TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN WOULD MAKE THIS TEMPORARY CHANGE PERMANENT ALLOWING COUNTIES TO CONTINUE USING THE APPLICATION'S GOING FORWARD. FOR THE COUNTIES THAT WERE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE TEMPORARY LIFTING OF THE RESTRICTIONS THEY FOUND THAT THEY WERE BETTER ABLE TO HELP THEIR HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WHERE POLLING PLACE FACILITIES OPTIONS WERE REALLY LIMITED. IT'S SURPRISING TO THINK IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THAT IT'S ACTUALLY BECOMING HARDER AND NOT EASIER FOR ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TO FIND. SUITABLE POLLING PLACES ARE BOTH CENTERS FOR THEIR VOTERS. HOWEVER SADLY IT IS SCHOOLS ARE LESS INCLINED TO SERVICE POINT PLACES BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY CONCERNS. THAT FROM ALL THE STRANGERS ON CAMPUS CHURCHES ARE REFUSING TO OPEN UP TO US TO VOTE CENTERS IN RECORD NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH. THE POLARIZING POLITICAL CLIMATEOF THE DAY SENIOR CENTER TO PAYING NO BECAUSE OF OUTSIDERS BRINGING AND GERMS ENDANGERING THE HEALTH OF THEIR KIDS THAT COMMUNITIES. BUT IMPROPER VOTING AT SEVERAL LOCATIONS THAT THE TICKET PARTICULARLY. BETTER STRAIGHT ACT COUNTY. WHO MUST HAVE LARGER REGIONAL FACILITIES OPEN FOR FOUR OR ELEVEN AROUND. HAVING HOLDEN WATCHES AVAILABLE AS VOTE CENTER SITES HAS BEEN THE PERFECT ALTERNATIVE TO THOSE FACILITIES ARE NOW TELLING US. NO WE'RE NOT AVAILABLE TO YOU. CAN YOU TO GO THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE CHECKLIST OF. PARKING ACCESSIBILITY PROXIMITY TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. ADA COMPLIANT AND MORE IN ORDER TO PICK THE RIGHT FACILITY FOR COMMUNITY. AT THE POLLING PLACE OR VOTE CENTER. AB TWENTY THREE SEVEN WILL ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE TO USE SOME FACILITIES THAT ARE COMMUNITIES HAVE ENJOYED USING FOR. THE LAST TWO MAJOR ELECTIONS AND SOME SPECIAL ELECTIONS. NOW ESPECIALLY THE TIME WE'RE REFINING REALLY FACILITIES IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT. WE ARE AWARE OF THE CONCERNS BY FORTH BY. JEFF AND THERE ARE. REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH OUR ORG. HAD A MEETING ON. WHICH FEEL IS PER. AND LOOKING FORWARD TO FURTHER MEETINGS TO FIND MORE COMMON GROUND LOOKING FORWARD THANK YOU AND WE- RESPECTFULLY REQUEST HER AYE VOTE.

WANT TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE TO THE AUTHORS- AND SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL FOR REACHING OUT TO US AND SITTING DOWN HAVING A HAVING A DISCUSSION- OUR PRIMARY. RIGHT NOW IS THAT- BARS ARE REALLY NOT NEUTRAL LOCATIONS- AND THERE IS. A CONCERN THAT ESPECIALLY PEOPLE RECOVERY OR PEOPLE WITH. ALCOHOL RELATED TRAUMA IT'S- PROXIMITY TO A- BAR PER SE IS. ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FRANCHISING IT REALLY DISCOURAGES THEM FROM USING THAT LOCATION AND THEN YOU KNOW. ARGUABLY COULD RISK RELAPSE. ARE THERE ARE OTHER. GROUPS YOU MIGHT BE SOMEHOW- ENJOINED FROM. BEING IN A BAR- BUT NONETHELESS HAVE THE VOTE WHO WOULD BE- ALSO BLOCKED OUT THROUGH THIS- SO REALLY THAT IS ASSEMBLY ISSUES OF THE BILL'S CHANGES ARE VERY BROAD- DO NOT HAVE ANY PROVISIONS.

A BAR- YEAH WE HAVE WE DO WE DO RESPECT THAT YOU KNOW THE- THE CLERKS ARE- BEARING THESE PROBLEMS IN MIND- WHEN THEY DO CHOOSE A LOCATION- BUT BUT UNLESS YOU LIKE TO SEE LANGUAGE THAT- BRITAX. GROUPS. AND YET THERE IS MORE MORE BROADLY THERE'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE CONCERN THAT- AGAIN WHEN THIS IS JUST SORT OF UP TO A DOZEN CALL FROM THE BOARDS THERE COULD BE AT A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE RATHER THAN HAVING A SORT OF NEUTRAL- HALL WITH THE BAR SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE BUILDING YOU KNOW IT MOVES CLOSER TO BEING DIRECTLY IN A PLACE WITH COVERED IN SIGNS COVERED AND- CUPBOARD AN ADVERTISING WITH. CAPS THERE SMELLING OF ALCOHOL STUFF THAT CAN BE DEEPLY TRIGGERING TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS ALCOHOL- YOU KNOW AGAIN AND AGAIN SIR SECONDARILY THAT THAT ADVERTISING IS AN ISSUE.

CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES TO ENSURE THAT VOTERS HAVE TIME AND FLEXIBILITY. IN THE VOTING PROCESS TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST VOTER SUPPRESSION TECHNIQUES ROOTED IN RACISM AND CLASSISM. AND TO ENSURE THAT VOTING IN CALIFORNIA IS A RIGHT NOT A PRIVILEGE. STILL THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT TAKEN THE STEP TO DESIGNATE ELECTION DAY STATEWIDE HOLIDAY AND ELEVATE THE DAY TO THE STATURE IT DESERVES. WE HAVE NUMEROUS DAYS TO REMEMBER EVENTS LONG PAST INTO REMEMBER IMPORTANT FIGURES WHO HAVE SHAPED OUR SOCIETY. SOME OF THE HOLIDAYS WE OBSERVE ARE INHERENTLY PROBLEMATIC BUT WE DON'T PLACE THE SAME IMPORTANCE ON THE DAY THAT KEEPS US MOVING FORWARD. BUT IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE SYMBOLISM DECLARING ELECTION DAY STATEWIDE HOLIDAY WILL ENABLE STUDENTS AND WORKERS TO VOLUNTEER IN THE ELECTION PROCESS. IT WILL ENCOURAGE MORE PRIVATE COMPANIES TO FOLLOW SUIT AS THEY HAVE WITH OTHER HOLIDAYS. AND IT WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT AND ABOUT CHATTING IN PUBLIC AND WEARING THEIR I VOTED STICKERS THOSE OF YOU HAVE PARTICIPATED IN VOTER OUTREACH DRIVES. NO THAT PEER PRESSURE IS ONE OF THE BEST TOOLS TO GET SOMEONE TO VOTE. MOST IMPORTANTLY PROVIDING THAT THEY OFFER BUSY COLLEGE STUDENTS WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO DEVELOP A LIFELONG HABIT. AT A CRUCIAL TIME IN THEIR LIVES. BUT IT'S JOIN COUNTLESS OTHER STATES COUNTRIES AND CALIFORNIA COMPANIES THAT HAVE DECLARED SPECIFIC SECOND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DAY THAT WE ABOUT.

GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE TO GET ANYMORE YOUNG WITH POLITICAL SOLUTIONS CALLING ON BEHALF OF SILICON VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THE STRUCTURE THAT DOES THE EXACT SECURE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU MODERATOR ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS BECAUSE I HAVE A GREAT AFFECTION FOR THE AUTHOR OF AN INVINCIBLE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF MANY OF HIS BILLS- BUT ONCE AGAIN I'LL BE VOTING NO ON THIS ON THIS MEASURE- THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS- THAT I HAVE- BEEN A RABID SUPPORTER OF MAIL IN BALLOTS BECAUSE- I BELIEVE ACCESS VOTING RIGHTS AND GETTING IN THE HANDS OF VOTERS MAKING AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO VOTE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT YOU GET THAT BALLOT ALMOST FOUR WEEKS BEFORE ELECTION DAY. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON AT ALL TO BE ABLE HAVE A STATE HOLIDAY IT'S A WASTE OF RESOURCES AND FOR THAT REASON- I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS AT THIS BILL. TODAY THANK YOU MISTER MAYES BUT YOURSELF. ALL RIGHT SO I'M GOING TO PAY YOU BACK A I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS ALREADY PREVIOUSLY MADE. FOR CALLING FROM THE YUCCA VALLEY- GIVEN OUR CURRENT ELECTION LAWS. IT'S REALLY NOT NEEDED- THE FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION DAY THE PEOPLE CAN VOTE IN PERSON- GIVES THEM A WEEKEND SATURDAY SUNDAY MONDAY AND TUESDAY. SO THAT THEY CAN GO IN- MOST PEOPL- ESPECIALLY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR ALREADY OFF. ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. AND THEN MOST PEOPLE ARE OFF ON SUNDAYS. SO THAT ALLOWS THE PRIVATE PUBLIC PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO BE TREATED EQUALLY- THIS WOULD SET UP A SITUATION WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. PEOPLE NOT BEING ABLE TO GO TO THE POLLS MOST PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES ARE ACTUALLY NOT THE PEOPLE THAT. SHOULD BE THIS SHOULD BE AIMED AT- BECAUSE THEIR THEIR JOBS ARE INHERENTLY BETTER JOBS AND BETTER PAID AND THEY ALSO HAVE GOOD BENEFITS. IT WHICH INCLUDES TIME OFF TO GO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY IF WE IF NEED BE. I USED TO HAVE TO MANAGE THIS MYSELF- BY YOU KNOW WITH A WHOLE BATTALION OF FOLKS THAT WANT TO VOTE. BUT THE ADVENT OF MAIL IN BALLOTS TO COME OUT A MONTH AHEAD OF TIME IT'S REALLY NOT NEEDED. THE OTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS THIS- I ALSO- AND- VERY SENSITIVE TO. THAT FEBRUARY HOLIDAY THAT'S PRESIDENT'S DAY WEEKEND IT'S USUALLY A FOUR DAY HOLIDAY. THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG HOLIDAYS THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GET THEIR KIDS TAKE A BREAK FROM SCHOOL AND GET OUT OF TOWN. AND THAT'S ALSO A WINTER HOLIDAY SO EXPAND SOME OF THE THAT THINGS THAT THEY GET TO DO- IN THAT TIME AND IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY FOR THE HOLIDAYS- BREAKING THAT UP AND NOT LETTING THEM DO THAT EVERY SECOND YEAR- I THINK IT. IS TOO MUCH OF A TRADE OFF. TO GAIN WHAT I THINK IS NOT REALLY MUCH FROM THIS IF YOU HAD BROUGHT THIS WHEN WE DID NOT HAVE OUR CURRENT LAWS. SET UP FOR A GROUP A FOR MAILING VOTING. PRIVATE PROBABLY BE OKAY WITH IT- BUT SINCE IT IT DIVIDES THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IT TAKES AWAY THAT HOLIDAY THAT IS VALUABLE TO FAMILIES AND- IN IT'S JUST NOT NEEDED- I'LL ALSO BE VOTING NO. THANKS ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I SURE THE AUTHORS GOALS OF REDUCING BARRIERS TO VOTING- I AM CONCERNED THAT PRIVATE EMPLOYERS HAVE WON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO FOLLOW THE STATES LEAD ON CALIFORNIA'S TAKE A LOT OF STEPS RECENTLY VOTE BY MAIL EXPANSION EXPANDING THE WINDOW TO VOTING BUT I THINK A LOT OF THOSE EFFORTS MAKING ELECTION DAY A HOLIDAY AS ANOTHER TOOL TOWARD REDUCING THOSE BARRIERS AND SO I'M RECOMMENDING.
