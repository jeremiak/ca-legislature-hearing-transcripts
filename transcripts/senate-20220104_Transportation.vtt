00:15:03.802 --> 00:15:05.604
STATES DON'T EVEN THOUGH OTHER

00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:08.474
STATES DON'T. COAL BASED

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.209
GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY HAS

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:12.211
BEEN DROPPING ANNUALLY IN THE

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:14.713
UNITED STATES WHICH IT'S NOT

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.715
NECESSARILY THE CASE ELSEWHERE

00:15:16.782 --> 00:15:19.018
IN THE WORLD SO OF COURSE. ONE

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:23.289
OF THE ONLY MARKETS FOR COAL IS

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:26.258
EXTERNALLY AND- SINCE WE ARE

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:28.527
CLEAR THAT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.262
SERIOUS POLLUTANTS WHEN IT COMES

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:32.197
TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS WE DON'T

00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:33.699
NECESSARILY WANT TO BE

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:36.135
ASSISTING. HAVING OUR POOL GOING

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:37.770
ELSEWHERE AND BEING BURNT

00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:39.772
MEANINGFUL IN GENERATED IN NORTH

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:43.942
AMERICA SO. I THINK IT IS A VERY

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:46.679
WISE- BILL. IN ADDITION TO ITS

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:49.381
PROTECTION OF THE NORTH COAST

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:52.484
AND AS THE SENATOR POINTED OUT A

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:54.586
SIMILAR ACTION WAS TAKEN TO

00:15:54.653 --> 00:15:56.755
PREVENT A COAL DEPOT FROM THE

00:15:56.822 --> 00:15:58.257
PORT OF AKLAND FOR THE SAME

00:15:58.324 --> 00:15:59.625
REASON IT WOULD'VE BEEN COAL

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:02.328
GENERATED ELSEWHERE AND SOLD

00:16:02.394 --> 00:16:05.798
THEM TO ASIA. SO WITH THAT I

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:07.599
WILL MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:08.600

CHAIR OF PUTTING ASIDE ALL THE

00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:15.974
DISCUSSIONS ON COAL HAVE WE AS A

00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:19.111
STATE- OTHER LEGISLATION EVER

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:21.480
HAD A BILL THAT WOULD PROHIBIT

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:23.882
ANY STATE MONEY FROM BEING USED

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:26.719
TO REHABILITATE. EXISTING

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:28.921
FACILITIES OR OPERATIONS AS ITS

00:16:28.987 --> 00:16:31.056
STAFF REPORT AND CONCEPT

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:34.293
INCLUDING A RAILYARD OR RAIL IF

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.495
ANY RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE I GET

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:38.297
THE I GET THE REAL BANKING I

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:39.798
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WE'RE DOING

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:41.300
MORE THAN THAT MORE THAN JUST

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:42.501
CALL WE'RE SAYING WE'LL NEVER

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:44.403
SPEND ANY MONEY ON ANY OF THESE

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.573
FACILITIES HAVE WE EVER DONE

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:49.541
THAT TO THE AUTHORS. KNOWLEDGE

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:51.310
SENATOR MCGUIRE THANK YOU SO

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:53.011
MUCH FOR INTER THANK YOU SIR BYE

00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:56.115
CASKEY UNFORTUNATELY FEDERAL LAW

00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:58.250
DOES NOT ALLOW THE STATE. IN

00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:00.285
YOUR LOCAL ENTITIES TO BE ABLE

00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:04.323
TO SINGLE OUT- INDIVIDUAL USES

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:07.726
OF A RAIL. FOR EXAMPLE COAL AND

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:09.762
OIL IT'S ALL OR NOTHING. AND

00:17:09.828 --> 00:17:13.999
THAT IS WHY IT IS STATED AS SUCH

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:15.768
IN THE BILL. UNDER THE PREVIOUS

00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:17.936
BILL IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:19.471
WHEN THEN SENATOR HANCOCK

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:22.274
ADVANCED HER BILL. IT WAS VERY

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:24.710
FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE OF COAL

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:28.714
TERMINALS- BUT- THERE IS AN

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:30.783
ACTIVE RAIL LINE IN THE PORT

00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:32.751
AROUND IN AND AROUND THE PORT OF

00:17:32.818 --> 00:17:34.820
OAKLAND THERE IS NOT BEEN AN

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:36.622
ACTIVE RAIL LINES IN THIS

00:17:36.688 --> 00:17:39.925
STRETCH FOR. WELL SINCE BEFORE I

00:17:39.992 --> 00:17:42.261
WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL SO THIRTY

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:45.063
YEARS AGO- IN SO THAT IS WHY WE

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.899
ARE FOCUSED ON RAIL IN IN JUST

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:49.435
BEING CANDID ABOUT IT THERE IS

00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:52.504
NO WAY IN HELL. A FREE RAIL LINE

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:54.706
WILL EVER START AGAIN. THROUGH

00:17:54.773 --> 00:17:57.109
THE RIVER CANYON IT'S TOO

00:17:57.176 --> 00:17:58.310
EXPENSIVE AND THE BUSINESS

00:17:58.377 --> 00:18:00.179
SIMPLY IS NOT THERE IN FACT

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:02.748
WE'VE TALKED WITH A HALF DOZEN

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:04.783
FREIGHT OPERATORS THAT SINCE WE

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.785
STARTED. ON THE GREAT RED

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:08.687
BETRAYAL OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.290
YEARS AND NO ONE CAN MAKE THE

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:13.058
BUSINESS CASE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:14.259
THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL

00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:17.329
LITERALLY DID BE BILLIONS OF

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:19.765
DOLLARS- AND- THE FREE OPERATION

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:21.600
SIMPLY IS NOT THERE TO SUSTAIN.

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:30.943
ANY TYPE OF- FUTURE FREIGHT RAIL. OKAY I MEAN I THINK THAT I

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:33.745
JUST WANT. TO SO IF I UNDERSTAND

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:36.515
IN ORDER TO GET THE PROBATION ON

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:38.484
THE WHOLE ELEMENT ON THE LINE

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.519
YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT THE STATE

00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:42.421
WILL PUT NO MONEY INTO ANY REAL

00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:44.156
PREPARATION WHICH IS DIFFERENT

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:46.625
FROM THE HANCOCK BILL BECAUSE-

00:18:46.692 --> 00:18:48.560
TECHNICALLY YOU COULD STILL RUN

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:50.295
HOLD UP AND DOWN THE LINE YOU

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:51.597
JUST COULDN'T GET IT TO THE

00:18:51.663 --> 00:18:53.499
TERMINAL THAT WAS THE- THAT WAS

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:54.299
THE DIFFERENCE. I GUESS THE

00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:55.968
OTHER QUESTION IS I HAVEN'T SAID

00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:57.803
THIS IS THE CONTINUOUS LINE SO I

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.372
UNDERSTAND THE EAGLE RIVER AS IT

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:01.807
CROSSES THROUGH THE DIFFERENT

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:03.976
SECTIONS HERE BUT LET'S SAY IS A

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:06.778
MINOR IS YOUR INFIRM DALE AND

00:19:06.845 --> 00:19:10.582
THE LINE GOES TO ARCADE AND

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:11.683
SOMEBODY WANTS TO USE THAT LINE.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.385
THEY ARE UNDER THE FEDERAL

00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:14.887
SYSTEM THEY COULD. AND AGAIN I

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:16.522
DON'T SEE IT ECONOMICALLY MAKING

00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:17.723
SENSE RIGHT NOW BUT IN THE

00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:19.491
FUTURE THEY COULD GO INTO THE

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:20.792
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. UNDER THERE

00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:23.228
ARE REAL BANKING GIVEN EXEMPTION

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:24.663
TO DO THAT UNDER THIS

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.132
LEGISLATION NO STATE FUNDS WOULD

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:29.535
BE ALLOWED TO. REHABILITATE THE

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:31.370
RAIL YARD FOR ANY OF THE

00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:33.472
FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO BE. A

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:34.606
FUTURE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:35.674
HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT. YOU'RE

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:37.776
CORRECT SIR ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:38.777
THANK YOU SENATOR WHITE

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:41.914
HOUSEKEEPING HE SAID REQUIRED WE

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.081
HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION FROM

00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:44.216
SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM

00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:46.985
CHAIR MEMBERS- I REALLY JUST

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:48.420
HAVE A COMMENT MORE THAN IT

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:50.522
QUESTION I I'VE BEEN IN FAVOR OF

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:51.423
RAIL BANKING FOR SOME TIME I

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.659
BELIEVE THAT- IT'S AN

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:55.193
OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP THE CORRIDOR

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.263
INTACT- WE CAN MAKE TRAILS OUT

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.432
OF THEN WE CAN DO WHATEVER BUT

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:01.600
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE

00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:02.801
HOLDS A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:04.469
WHEN. WE'RE NOT HERE. MAYBE

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:06.605
THERE IS SOME OTHER. USE FOR

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:08.473
THAT CORRIDOR AND IT WOULD BE

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.842
MAINTAINED. BUT THIS BILL IS

00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:11.510
MORE ABOUT. THE RESOURCES

00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:13.245
AVAILABLE AS THE STATE LOOKS AT

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:15.047
IT THOSE THOSE DETERMINATIONS

00:20:15.113 --> 00:20:16.648
WILL BE DONE AT THE FEDERAL

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:21.353
LEVEL. ON HOW THOSE RAIL BASE

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.322
WILL BE USED SO FOR THIS BILL

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:26.058
I'M I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT TODAY

00:20:26.124 --> 00:20:28.193
AND THE REASON BEING IS THAT IF

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.861
WE'RE GOING TO SPEND ANY OF THE

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:31.930
RESOURCES THAT ARE AVALABLE TO

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:32.464
CALIFORNIANS THERE'S A LOT

00:20:32.531 --> 00:20:34.700
BETTER PLACES THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:36.468
FOCUSING OUR RESOURCES ON- WE

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:39.404
JUST. NO DURING THE BREAK WE HAD

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:42.240
THE- PORTS ANALYSIS I KNOW MANY

00:20:42.307 --> 00:20:43.875
OF YOU WERE THERE. WE TALKED

00:20:43.942 --> 00:20:45.243
ABOUT GETTING A RAIL LINE FROM

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.878
THE PORTS IN SAN DIEGO OUT TO

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:48.714
THE INLAND EMPIRE WHICH WOULD.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.315
REDUCE TRAFFIC IN OUR INNER

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:51.583
CITIES AND ACTUALLY DO GOOD

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.118
CARBON WORK. REDUCING CARBON SO

00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:54.519
THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT I THINK

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.388
THAT- IF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO

00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:57.322
BE SPENDING RESOURCESWE SHOULD

00:20:57.389 --> 00:20:58.557
BE FOCUSING THOSE RESOURCES ON

00:20:58.624 --> 00:21:00.559
AREAS WHERE WE KNOW WE CAN.

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:01.693
REDUCE TRUCK TRAFFIC IN OUR

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.829
INNER CITIES AND PORTS. AND PUT

00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:05.664
RAIL LINES OUT TO- YOU KNOW

00:21:05.731 --> 00:21:07.833
INTERMODAL SYSTEMS THAT- WE WORK

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:09.468
OUTSIDE OF OUR CITY SO THAT'S

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:10.469
THE REASON I'LL BE SUPPORTING

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:12.404
THIS BILL- IN THE FUTURE WE

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:13.338
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA COME

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:14.840
WE'LL KEEP THAT. REAL BANK TO

00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:16.408
WHERE IT SHOULD BE PEOPLE CAN

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:18.343
HIKE THAT HAS A TRAIL FOR NOW

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.545
BUT IN THE FUTURE IF IT WANTED

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:31.089
TO BE USED FOR- FEDERAL- ASSESS. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY I

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:32.424
THINK WE ALREADY HAVE A MOTION

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:33.425
