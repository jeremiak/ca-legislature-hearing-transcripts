TWO TWO FOUR PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS REFERENCED IN COMMON NUMBER FOR THE COMMITTEE OUT ANALYSIS AND AGAIN COMPLEMENT TO. COMMITTEE STAFF AND MY STAFF AND THE SPONSORS FOR WORKING WELL TOGETHER TO GET US TO THIS POINT SB TWO TO FOUR IS. SOMEWHAT OF A COMPANION BILL TO SB ONE FOURTEEN- AS WE KNOW MENTAL HEALTH IS CRITICAL TO OVERALL WELL BEING AND THE ACADEMIC SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS. PINE RECOGNIZE AN UNTREATED EARLY TREATED MENTAL ILLNESS ELEVATES THE RISK OF MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS SUCH AS SUICIDE AND SELF INJURY INJURY. AND IT DIMINISHES THE PROSPECTS FOR RECOVERY AND CAN CONTRIBUTE TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OTHER NEGATIVE COPING BEHAVIORS MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING AT LEAST ONE IN FIVE YOUTH LIVE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO INCREASE AWARENESS AND EMPOWER STUDENTS TO HELP- BY REDUCING THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IS THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE SETTING FOR PROVIDING THIS EDUCATION TO ALL STUDENTS. GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO STATE MANDATED HEALTH EDUCATION COURSE AT THE MIDDLE OR HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL IN CALIFORNIA. ON MENTAL HEALTH THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS DO NOT RECEIVE ANY INSTRUCTION IN MENTAL HEALTH SB TWO TO FOUR WILL ENSURE THAT PEOPLE'S BETWEEN GRADES ONE AND TWELVE RECEIVED. AN AGE APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION FROM A QUALIFIED INSTRUCTOR AT LEAST ONCE DURING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ONCE DURING MIDDLE SCHOOL. AND ONCE DURING HIGH SCHOOL. SO I HAVE A- WE WILL TO HELP IDENTIFY STUDENTS AT RISK BUT WE ALSO WANT TO HELP STUDENTS UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE FACING WITH THIS ISSUE AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST OBSERVATIONS I'VE FOUND AS I'VE PROPOSED THESE BILLS IS PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AND ASK. WHAT HAPPENS OF A STUDENT IS FAKING. AND I ALWAYS SAY WE DON'T ASK THAT QUESTION WHEN A STUDENT HAS A COLD. DON'T ASK THAT QUESTION WHEN A STUDENT. SAYS THEY HAVE OHER PHYSICAL ISSUES SO THAT EDUCATION AND AWARENESS AND AN UNDERSTANDING IS IMPORTANT EDUCATION IS WHERE IT SHOULD HAPPEN IN SCHOOL SO ON THE PHONE TODAY I HAVE SOVIET TRACTORS PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH EMPOWER NETWORK.

OKAY I JUST WANT IT AS A AS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND- I JUST I'M ALWAYS AFRAID OF MANDATES THAT DON'T COME WITH FUNDING SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT WHICH I THINK IS A GREAT IDEA. JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HAVE THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO MEET. THIS MANDATE. THAT I HAVE. I HAVE EVERY HOPE TO. HAVE INCREASE FUNDING FOR BOTH BILLS OBVIOUSLY THERE IS MONEY FOR SB FOURTEEN IN THE BUDGET. THE RELATIVE TO- MENTAL HEALTH SO WE'RE HOPING THAT. WE CAN MAKE SURE OF ALL THAT ARE PROPERLY FUNDED BUT- I ALSO SAY. WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF LOCAL CONTROL INTO S. B. TWO TWO FOUR. TO ALLOW DISTRICTS TO IMPLEMENT THIS- SORT OF WITHIN THEIR OWN SYSTEM.

AND KEEP UP WITH THEIR PEERS IN SCHOOLS LATER IN LIFE. BUT THAT IDENTIFICATION AND SUPPORT STUDENTS AT RISK FOR DYSLEXIA ARE LESS LIKELY TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL AND ATTEND COLLEGE LAND JOBS. WHEN THEY WANTED FACE GREATER RISKS OF INCARCERATION. IN SOME PRISONS TODAY. NEARLY. 80% OF THE INMATES. HAVE LEARNING DISABILITIES THAT ARE ON THE DYSLEXIA SPECTRUM. SB TWO THREE SEVEN WILL HELP ELIMINATE INEQUALITIES OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS. BY REQUIRING LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY SERVING STUDENTS IN GRADES KINDERGARTEN TO ANNUALLY SCREEN EVERY STUDENT FOR THE RISK OF DYSLEXIA. THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION MOST APPLICATION APPROVED LIST OF CULTURALLY LINGUISTICALLY AND DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE SCREENING TOOLS. AND SCREENING RESULTS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO TEACHERS AND PARENTS THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR ENGLISH LEARNING STUDENTS. THAT WILL HAVE A BIG CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY SENSITIVE SO WE DON'T OVER IDENTIFY UNNECESSARILY. WITHOUT UNIVERSAL SCREENING MANY STUDENTS WITHOUT SUFFICIENT RESOURCES AND ADVOCACY ON THEIR BEHALF WILL NOT BE IDENTIFIED AT RISK. FOR BEING DYSLEXIA DYSLEXIC AND RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT THEY NEED THEY NEED. TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL RESEARCH SHOWS THAT EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND- FOR INTERVENTION WHICH SCIENTIFICALLY BASED READING INSTRUCTION STRATEGIES ARE MATERIALS IMPROVE LITERACY OUTCOMES. FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE RISK FOR DYSLEXIA AND DELAYED IDENTIFICATION SUPPORTS. CLOSING THE- ACADEMIC GAPS AND LEARNING LOSS IN CORE CONTENT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME. EVEN AFTER SIGNIFICANT COST INTERVENTIONS UNIVERSAL EARLY SCREENING FOR STUDENTS AT RISK CAN HELP FAMILIES AND TEACHERS SUPPORT THE BEST LEARNING OUTCOMES. FOR ALL THE STUDENTS CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND HELP SCHOOL AND HELP END THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELIE. I'M ACTIVELY DISCUSSING THIS BILL WITH THE PTA AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO ENSURE. THAT WE HAVE THE STRONGEST BILL POSSIBLE. WE KNOW THAT MANY OF US CAN GO TO THE FINEST PEDIATRICIANS WHEN WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH OUR CHILDREN. BUT THERE IS A SOCIAL INEQUITY AND AS SOCIAL JUSTICE COMPONENT OF THIS NOT EVERY FAMILY HAS THAT CAPACITY. AND HAVING THE SCHOOLS IDENTIFY. THE RISK FOR DYSLEXIA WILL CERTAINLY HELP LEVEL THAT PLAYING FIELD. ON THE PHONE TODAY WE HAVE CORINNE WEAVER ON BEHALF OF THE OAKLAND UP END UP- ACP. WE ALSO HAVE NAY PUT TECHS FROM COATING DECIDE CALIFORNIA WHO IS ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL ALONG WITH THAT VOICE AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU SENATOR PORTANTINO LET'S GO TO THE LEAD SUPPORT MISTER MODERATOR. HI MY NAME IS CORY WEAVER CO FOUNDER FULCRUM NUMBER OF LOCAL UNIVERSITIES EDUCATION COMMITTEE. FORMER EDL LEADERS AND SCHOOL BASED EDUCATOR FOR TWENTY YEARS HELLO I'M CONNECTED TO ORGANIZATIONS ADVOCATING THE QUALITY PUBLICATION. EDUCATION FOR EVERY CHILD IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS I HAVE A PERSONAL STORY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SB TWO THIRTY SEVEN. MY NEPHEW ELIJAH STRUGGLING SCHOOLS CHALLENGES WERE TRIBUTE TO LACK OF MOTIVATION AND EFFORT. IT WASN'T UNTIL HE WENT TO JAIL BUT HE WAS GOING TO THE COLLECTION. LATER IN MY ROLE AS UNION LEADERS I TRAIN YOU LICENSE FORMER FIRST GRADE TEACHER. RECENTLY DISCUSSED HOW SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER OF THE CHILD IN HER CLASS WAS DYSLEXIC. BEHIND TEARS A TEACHER STATED. I HAD NO IDEA. AND THAT'S THE POINT. SCHOOLS ARE BEING ASKED TO PROVIDE A FREE APPROPRIATE PUBLIC EDUCATION BUT DON'T HAVE THE G. INFORMATION TO KNOW. WHAT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE. UNIFORM SCHOOL EXPERIENCES OFTEN WITHERING CHRISTIANS THE UCSF DYSLEXIA CENTER CIRCUIT BY THIRD GRADE. THE SELECTED STUDENTS OFTEN SUFFER FROM PTSD. MY NEPHEWS MESSAGE TO LAWMAKERS HIS. UNCLE TELL THEM IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SCREENING WOULD HELP THE SCHOOL AND MY DAD FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. THE WOULD REALLY HELP ME BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON SO I WENT TO JAIL. IT WAS A HUGE WEIGHT OFF MY SHOULDERS I THOUGHT I WAS JUST SLOW. LAWMAKERS MY NUMBER. ON THE CALL ME IF THEY WANT TO TALK. HIS NUMBER IS FIVE ONE OH EIGHT TWO NINE THREE SIX NINE THREE. DESPITE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT IS DYSLEXIA GUIDELINES FOR RESOLUTIONS FROM CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS CALLING FOR SCREENING. MOST STUDENTS REMAIN ON THEIR OWN. FAMILIES WITH RESOURCES MARKET PRIVATE SCREEN BUT MOST STUDENTS ARE SHUT OUT THE BONOBOS THE SOFT BIGOTRY OF LOW EXPECTATIONS WERE CHALLENGES ARE SEEN. AS MORE BASIL ISSUES OR COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR INTELLIGENCE. I HAD NO IDEA COULD NOT BE THE STATE'S OUR SCHOOLS WHILE DEFERRING TO THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS.

OLD UNCLE IS UNACCEPTABLE. WE NOW KNOW THE READ INDICATOR OF THE- THAT ARE HIGHLY PREDICTIVE- CAN BE EASILY MEASURED USING GREEN COST EFFECTIVE SCREENING INSTRUMENT. AT THE FIRST GRADE TEACHER I WOULD WELCOME THESE TOOLS THEY WOULD HAVE MADE MY JOB EASIER. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE MOST IMPACTFUL WINDOW OF TIME FOR PROVIDING INTERVENTION IS BEFORE AGE NINE. WITH INTERVENTION CHILDREN WITH DYSLEXIA CAN BECOME STRONG READERS AND REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. BUT THE FACT OF EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF RISK AND INTERVENTION. WE CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN PLACED IN SPECIAL EDUCATION BY UP TO SEVENTY PERCENT. THE EVIDENCE I'M DYSLEXIC KEEPS GROWING AT THE WAIT. TO FAIL MODEL PERCENT.

GOOD MORNING MARCUS ERRICO SAID DHEAS REPRESENTING CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF ALL STUDENTS INCLUDING ENGLISH LEARNERS GETTING ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE INSTRUCTION AND CERTAINLY STUDENTS DIAGNOSED WITH DYSLEXIA SHOULD GET APPROPRIATE EARLY INTERVENTIONS. SENATE BILL TWO THREE SEVEN DOES NOT CALL FOR THIS IT PROPOSES ANNUALLY SCREENING ALL STUDENTS KINDERGARTEN THROUGH SECOND GRADE INCLUDING STRONG READERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF IDENTIFYING WAYS WHETHER THEY ARE AT RISK OF DYSLEXIA. FOR ELL STUDENTS SCREENING KINDERGARTEN THROUGH SECOND GRADE WILL LEAD TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS OVER IDENTIFYING DETAILS AS DYSLEXIC RESULTING IN THE NARROWING OF THEIR INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM TO FOCUS ONLY ON FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS AND NOT IN OTHER AREAS NECESSARY. FOR A CHOIR IN LITERACY SUCH AS COMPREHENSIVE AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT PROTECTIONS FOR OUR ELL STUDENTS NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN SENATE BILL TWO THREE SEVEN. SUCH AS ANY SCREENER OR ASSESSMENT MUST BE PROVEN TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY AND READING SKILLS. ENGLISH LEARNERS RECEIVING BILINGUAL INSTRUCTION MUST BE SCREENED AND ASSESSED IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE ONLY STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING READERS AS THE EVIDENCE BY TEACHER OBSERVATION FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS GRADE LEVEL LITERACY BENCHMARK ASSESSMENTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR SCREENING FOR DYSLEXIA ONCE THE STUDENTS SCREENED THERE IS NO NEED FOR YEARLY TESTING. TEACHERS IF THEY ARE THE SCREENERS WILL REQUIRE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING ON ITS HOUSTON ADMINISTRATION ESPECIALLY IF SCREENING ENGLISH LEARNERS ALL COMMUNICATION TO NON ENGLISH SPEAKING PARENTS MUST BE IN THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE. ONLY AS MUST MONITOR AND EVALUATE THE PROPORTIONALITY OF ENGLISH LEARNERS ANOTHER STUDENT SUBGROUPS IDENTIFIED AT RISK OF DYSLEXIA IN COMPARISON TO THEIR PERCENTAGE OF ENROLLMENT WITHOUT THE SAFEGUARDS THAT WE BELIEVE SENATE BILL. THREE SEVEN CREATES AN UNEASY ALL FIELD WHAT DOES IT. INCLUDE LEARNERS REGARD READING AND LATER. THESE ARE RECENT FOR OPPOSE CENTER BILL THREE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM WE WILL NOW GO TO OFFICE.

THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY TO HAVE ANY OTHER. DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NINE CENTER PORTANTINO GEORGIA CLOSE THANK YOU- MADAM CHAIR AND WE ARE CERTAINLY I AM CERTAINLY. SENSITIVE TO THE- ENGLISH LEARNER. ISSUE THAT'S BEEN RAISED AND I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT. YOU KNOW WITHIN THE BILL IT SAYS INTEREST INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE CULTURALLY ENGLISH LINGUISTICALLY AND DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE. FOR STUDENTS AND I ALSO AGREE THAT. EVERYTHING SHOULD BE TRANSLATED- AS YOU KNOW I'VE- PUT A BILL THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT. IT PEAS ARE TRANSLATED INTO. LANGUAGES SO FAMILIES- CAN KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEIR KIDS ALIVE SO WE'RE DEFINITELY I'M DEFINITELY SENSITIVE THOSE ISSUES I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. TO TRY TO WORK SOME OF THEM OUT WE THINK WE'VE MADE STRIDES TO BE SENSITIVE. WE ALSO I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE LOCAL. FLEXIBILITY FOR DISTRICTS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE A HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF ENGLISH LEARNERS WILL DO. A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THAT DON'T AND SO WE'RE REALLY WORKING WITH THE DISTRICT BY DISTRICT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS IMPLEMENTABLE. AND THE CHALLENGES FACING FAMILIES- TO IDENTIFY EARLY- DYSLEXIA IS GOING TO HAVE. AN EXPONENTIAL BENEFIT IN THE LONG RUN- SO WE THINK THAT SOCIAL JUSTICE ELEMENTS.

SILVERADO PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THE MEDICARE AND MEMBERS THE MADAM CHAIR WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED. AMENDMENTS AS REFLECTED ON PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS. THANK YOU 55% OF LA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS EXPERIENCE HOUSING INSECURITY THE LACK OF ACCESS TO HOUSING PRECLUDES MANY OF CALIFORNIANS FROM HIGHER EDUCATION. SB THREE THIRTY GIVES CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ESSENTIAL TOOLS TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS FACING BOTH THE STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE. PRESENT PRESENTLY. SOME COMMUNITY COLLEGES POSSESS EITHER AMUSE REAL PROPERTY OR FACILITIES THAT HAVE BECOME TOO FINANCIALLY BURDENSOME TO OPERATE SB THREE THIRTY GIVES CALIFORNIA COMEY COLLEGES THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPURPOSE SUCH UNUSED SPACE INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. SB THREE THIRTY AUTHORIZES THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS TO ENTER INTO LEASES OR AGREEMENTS WITH PRIVATE ENTITIES OR NOT PROFITS FOR JOINT OCCUPANCY A REAL PROPERTY AND BUILDINGS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR STUDENTS OR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. THE BILL EXTENDS EXISTING FIVE YEAR LEASE. OR AGREEMENT LIMITATION TO A TERM NOT TO EXCEED SIXTY SIX YEARS SO LONG AS THE JOINT OCCUPANCY LEASE AN AGREEMENT IS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR STUDENTS OR EMPLOYEES. FINALLY THE MEASURE AUTHORIZES THE GOVERNING BOARD OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS TO LEASE REAL PROPERTY FOR LESS THAN FAIR RENTAL VALUE TO AN ENTITY IF THAT ENTITY INTENDS TO ENTER INTO A LEASE AGREEMENT. FOR JOINT OCCUPANCY AND IS USED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL ARE PERMISSIVE AND PROVIDE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT THE MEANS TO ENTER INTO JOINT OCCUPANCY AGREEMENTS ONLY IF SUCH AN AGREEMENT PROVIDES A POSITIVE SOLUTION TO THESE NEEDS. CALIFORNIANS THE MIDST OF A CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS CANNOT SERVE THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS IF THE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO EVEN BASIC NEEDS WE WILL CREATE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THESE CAMPUSES THE BILL WAS SPONSORED BY THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. MY WITNESS TODAY WILL BE ALEX ALANIZ WHO IS APPEARING ON BEHALF OF THE LA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR RAZA. LISA PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN- CHARWOMAN LEYVA AND SENATORS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM ALEX CELANESE. THE LOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT I WANT TO EXPRESS ELLIE CCD STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB THREE THIRTY. HI THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE GIVE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ESSENTIAL TOOLS TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS FACING BOTH STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE. THE BILL AUTHORIZES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS TO ENTER INTO LEASES OR AGREEMENTS WITH PRIVATE ENTITIES FOR JOINT OCCUPANCY OF REAL PROPERTY AND BUILDINGS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR STUDENTS. LOUISE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY COLLEGE DISTRICT IS PROUD TO HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSE STUDENT BODIES WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS ENROLLED EACH YEAR. BUT DIDN'T COME FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE BRINGING DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY. TEN THOUSAND ROLLED IN COLLEGE PROMISED. STUDENTS REPRESENTING THE FIRST TO EVER GO TO COLLEGE STUDENTS RETURNING FOR A SECOND CHANCE. NEARLY 50% OF ALLEY CCD STUDENTS ARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY AND THIRTY FOUR. THIS STUDENT GROUP IS MORE VULNERABLE TO ACADEMIC STARTS AND STOPS AND IT NEED TO BE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES LACC OFFERS THE MOST. TAKING THE CRITICAL STEP TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL CAN BE EASILY DERAILED BECAUSE OF A CAR ISSUE WORK SCHEDULE THE CONFLICTS WITH THE CLASS OR RENT INCREASE. JANUARY THIS YEAR RENTAL LOS ANGELES WERE ON AVERAGE TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS. ONLY 1% OF RENTAL TODAY ARE BETWEEN SEVEN HUNDRED AND ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. OVER ONE THIRD OF RENTERS IN LA PAID MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR MONTHLY INCOME TO RENT. THIS BILL GIVES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS THE FLEXIBILITY TO ENTER INTO A JOINT OCCUPANCY PARTNERSHIP WITH THE RESPONSIBLE THIRD PARTY DEVELOPER.

BOB THEN THE SECOND ISSUE IS- YOU KNOW ON A TYPICAL- HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY WOULD BE REVIEWED- IN A PUBLIC PROCESS LOCALLY. ANARCHY HEARINGS AND THE LIKE THAT WOULD HAPPEN AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE SPECIAL PRIVILEGES HERE TO DO THESE THINGS WITHOUT THAT SAME- YEAH IT ENGAGEMENT- FOR THE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES THAT THEY'RE DOING AND THIS IS IT THIS IS A CHANGE THIS IS A- PROVIDING HOUSING AND- I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF LOCAL INPUT AND HOW WE CAN BE SURE THAT- CANNOT COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ISRAEL IS REACHING OUT AND ENGAGING- DID THAT DID YOU SPEAK OF IT AT ALL IN THIS BILL IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO WORK TO ENSURE THAT THAT. THAT IS. WHAT HAPPENS. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. UNDER BUT I WILL GLADLY LOOK INTO IT- I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE. THIS IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT. KIND OF DEVELOPMENT THAN WHAT I THINK PEOPLE EXPECT SO I WILL ABSOLUTELY LOOK INTO IT. BUT I THINK I DO THAT IN YOUR BILL IS JUST AN EXACT RIGHT DIRECTION AND- I DO KNOW IN MY DISTRICT HAVE THREE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEY'RE ALL DAY IN DIFFERENT PLACES YOU KNOW ONES UP ON A HILL. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THERE'S JUST NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE ANOTHER ONE SITS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND- YOU KNOW AGAIN TYPICALLY THE NEIGHBORS WE HAVE A CHANCE TO ENGAGE WITH THE LOCAL OFFICIALS AND THEY HAVE THE LOCAL HEARINGS AND THAT ALL GETS CIRCUMVENTED SITE I REALLY APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD TAKE JUST. CONSIDER SOME THINGS YOU CAN DO IN THE BILL TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS SOME ENGAGEMENT A PUBLIC HEARING- CONCERT A CONSULTATION OF- THE REQUIREMENT OF SOME KIND NAUTIC NECESSARILY GIVE AUTHORITY AWAY I APPRECIATE.

ALL RIGHT THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TO S. B. TWENTY TWO ON THE THINK THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON THIS BILL. THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE A FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR BOND ON THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO DOLLARS. FOR FACILITIES AFTER K. THROUGH TWELVE THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION. SPECIFICALLY THE BOND INCLUDES NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOR PRESCHOOL THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE TWELVE TWO BILLION EACH FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE LAST K. THROUGH TWELVE THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION BOND PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. HOWEVER BY TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ALL THESE FUNDS WERE THE SENSUALLY EXHAUSTED. DESPONDENT CRITICAL FOR BRINGING ALL OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS- K. TO TWELVE THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND ENSURING OUR CHILDREN HAVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN A SAFE PLACE TO LEARN. THE PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR SAFE SCHOOL AND CAMPUS FACILITIES THAT PROTECT THE-HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN AND STAFF. MANY SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT BUILDING SPACE TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AND STATE RE OPENING GUIDELINES. OR ON SMALLER CLASS SIZES. THERE'S SIGNIFICANT CONSTRUCTION UPGRADES AND REPAIRS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR LARGER CLASSROOMS IMPROVED VENTILATION SYSTEMS. AND REDUCING THE RISK OF TRANSMISSION AND SHARED SPACES. ACCORDING TO. THE P. P. I. C. ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE STATE SCHOOL FACILITIES ARE MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. AND RESEARCH HAS SHOWN IT WOULD COST OVER A HUNDRED SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS TO MODERNIZE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. IN THE NEXT DECADE. WE NEED TO DO OUR BEST FOR OUR STUDENTS- WE DID HAVE A DISAPPOINTING LOSS IN THE LAST ELECTION HONEST ON A BLIND I THINK IT'S A- IT'S THE RARE EXCEPTION FOR UNDER UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES. I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT- I THINK ALMOST SIXTY A LOCAL SCHOOL BOND MEASURES PASSED IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. AT THIS BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU- IS- A AN EXTENSION OF THE NECK OF THE COMPROMISES THAT OCCURRED FOR THE- MEASURE LAST YEAR AND- I KNOW THAT- THERE'S STILL MORE CONVERSATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS TO BE HAD WITH THE ARE ABLE. LEADER IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE GOVERNOR- TO FASHION THIS IN A WAY THAT- IS A RESPONSIVE TO ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED. AND SO FOR ME THIS IS JUST THE FIRST STEP OF THE IN THAT CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD IT ALLOWS THE SENATE TO STAND UP FOR THE IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS WE WANT TO SEE OUR SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES. I WANTED TO TECNOLOGIA- CENTER REQUIRES A CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE- AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THAT TODAY WE HAVE JASON MURPHY. FROM. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HERE TO TESTIFY.

AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'LL BE SENSITIVE TO GOING FORWARD AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY- ENDED THE SENATOR FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE. THE ONLY THING I WOULD NOTE- ABOUT THE- THE CEILING BEING RACES THAT THAT WOULD ONLY OCCUR WHERE THE VOTERS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES TO VOTE TO ACTUALLY- AGO GOT RAISE THEIR TAXES.

AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT- WELL I APPRECIATE YOUR TAX SENSITIVITY I SHARE THAT IN MANY WAYS- BUT THAT THIS WOULD STILL BE I REMAIN I LOCAL CHOICE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANTED THEIR TAXES TO GO UP.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST FIRST WANT TO START OUT WITH THEM BELOW HISTORY ABOUT THIS BILL. I WAS A CO AUTHOR OF A FEW YEARS AGO AND YOU OFFERED SOME AMENDMENTS AND I BELIEVE THE BILL WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND SO. FIRST OFF I WANNA SAY I TOOK THOSE AMENDMENTS AND I'VE WORKED WITH YOU CLOSELY AND SO ALL THIS TO IT READ A STATEMENT HERE AND THEN- MAYBE CLOSE WITH SOME OTHER COMMENTS- THANK YOU. SB TWO SEVENTEEN IS A VERY SIMPLE BILL THAT REQUIRES SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO POST THEIR SEX EDUCATION SEX ED CURRICULUM ONLINE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGE FOR ENGLISH THIS. IS A SECOND LANGUAGE YES FAMILIES. GIVEN THE CURRENT DISTANCE LEARNING EDUCATION SYSTEM EVEN WITH THE RECENT PLAN FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO ALLOW SCHOOLS TO OPEN. PAIRS CANNOT PHYSICALLY VISIT THE SCHOOL TO ACQUIRE MATERIALS THAT WILL BE TAUGHT TO THEIR CHILDREN. SECTION FIVE ONE THREE NINE EIGHT B. AND ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY YOUTH ACT REQUIRES THAT PARENTS. BE NOTIFIED. THE MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION GIVEN THE- THAT WE ARE IN THE COLD AIR WITH DISTANCE LEARNING PARENTS CANNOT PHYSICALLY GO TO THE CAMPUS. TO THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO INSPECT MATERIALS ARE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CURRENT LAW. THIS TO INTERNET BASED DISTANCE LEARNING WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SCHOOLS TO GET PARENTS MORE ENGAGED IN THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND THIS BILL HELPS FURTHER THAT GOAL. SCHOOLS POST OR PROVIDE OR PROVIDE PARENTS WITH NUMEROUS OTHER CURRICULAR MATERIALS SO THAT IS WHY THIS MATERIAL IS. NEEDED I'VE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION WITH A CHAIR- THAT WE SHOULD NOT THIS BILL HAD TERRIBLE PEOPLE IN SUPPORT SEVERAL PEOPLE IN OPPOSITION WAS A LOT OF TESTIMONY- THAT WE SHOULD JUST DO GOOD POLICY FOR KIDS ALSO JUST THE OTHER DAY I WAS TALKING TO DOCTOR PAN. AND HE TOLD ME ABOUT A TIME THAT A TEACHER'S SOURCED INFORMATION FROM AN OPINION WEBSITE INSTEAD OF A CREDIBLE FACT BASED SITE. THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO PREVENT. TO ENCOURAGING FRIENDLY GAUGE AND ADDS IN EDUCATION. WE'RE ALL DOING THAT WE ARE WE ARE ALL HERE WE- WE ARE ALL DOING HERE TO ENSURE THE PARENTS CAN BE ENGAGE AT A LEVEL. THEY CHOOSE IN THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION. TO WRAP IT UP- I THINK THIS IS A REALLY GOOD TRANSPARENCY BILL I- I BELIEVE THAT I'LL BE WORKING ON THIS BILL IF WE DON'T GET ON THIS COMMITTEE I KNOW THAT I'VE TALKED TO MOST OF. THE SENATORS ON THE PANEL AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS- IN A DIFFERENT TIME SO I JUST WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I'D BE BACK HAPPY TO TAKE A- THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR DOLLY.

I WANT TO SHARE SOME OF THE FEEDBACK I RECEIVED DISTRICTS HAVE FOUND THAT THE USE OF TRAINED BILINGUAL STAFF.

DISTRICTS ALSO HIGHLIGHT DISTRICTS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THAT PARENTS AND OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS SUCH AS FAITH LEADERS AND COMMUNITY AND NON PROFITS FOR EXAMPLE ARE INVOLVED IN MATERIAL SELECTION BEFORE THEY ARE USED IN THE CLASSROOM.

SO IT'S NOT TAKING AWAY IT'S JUST ALLOWING PARENTS TO FIND UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY JUST ALLOWING PARENTS TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE MATERIAL AND HAVING IT ACCESSIBLE VIA pTO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT CHANGING IT JUST. MAKING IT AGE APPROPRIATE AND MAKING IT A VISIBLE AVAILABLE- VIA THE INTERNET FOR PARENTS TO SEE AND IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY- THE DISTRICT'S ABILITY TO TEACH THAT THE MATERIAL- BUT- BUT ALLOWS PARENTS- IN WILD. REVIEWING THE MATERIAL TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY FEEL IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR CHILDREN DEVELOPMENTALLY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INSTRUCTION OF THE MATERIAL- WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING- MOVING FORWARD ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR CENTER PAN. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FIRST OF ALL I DO WANT TO THANK A CENTER DOLLY FOR REACHINGOUT TO I THINK WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION- I THINK- APPRECIATE YOU REFERENCING PART OF THAT CONVERSATION ALTHOUGH I DO A POINT OUT THAT THAT WAS NOT IN RELATION TO THE- SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS BILL IS RELATION TO ANOTHER TOPIC THAT WAS BEING TAUGHT IN SCHOOL BUT THAT IT DOES ILLUSTRATE. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES- BUT- I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOL BOARDS. I MEAN THAT WE HAVE ELECTED SCHOOL BOARDS AND I KNOW THAT US. ON THIS ONE OF OUR MEMBERS HERE'S AS A RECENT NUMBER OF A SCHOOL BOARD. I DO WANNA BE'S YUP- THAT. BEFORE WE IMPOSE SOMETHING ON THE STATE WHICH- WE OFTEN DO BUT- THAT- THAT. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO. ISSUES THAT ARE RELATED TO- THEIR COMMUNITY. I THINK THERE IS A ON BE CAREFUL THAT WE'RE NOT ESSENTIALLY OPPOSING- OVERLY ONEROUS- IT'S ACTUALLY REGULATIONS OR RULES- THAT- THAT MAY ACTUALLY INHIBIT- SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM BEING ABLE TO DO THAT THE JOB THAT SHE'LL NEED NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF EDUCATING THE CHILDREN- ESTIMATE I. DO HAVE- YOU KNOW THEY THINK THAT CONCERNS OF SIDE IT MY COLLEAGUES IN A POSITION COLLEAGUES IN AMERICAN COLLEGE OF- OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR OPPOSITION. AS WELL AS THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY'S CONCERNS. IT'S THINK- NEED TO BE- THAT ADDRESSED- SO. I APPRECIATE- CENTER DOLLY THAT- YOU ARE OPENING A DIALOGUE I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONTINUING DIALOGUE BY YOU NOT FEEL THAT I AM AT THIS POINT TIME ABLE TO VOTE FOR THE BILL AT THIS COMMITTEE HEARING. BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS IT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU THANK YOU. THANK. YOU CENTER PAN CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU IT SURELY I'LL ONE AS THANK- THE ALL THE BILL FOR HIS SIDE A ENGAGEMENT WITH AND COVER. I FEEL HIS HEARTFELT CONCERNS ABOUT THIS- ISSUE- IT I HAVE BEEN IN GENERAL TERMS ALWAYS WANTED TO BE CAREFUL- THAT WE SET A HIGH BAR FOR SETTING STATE MANDATES- AND THAT WE HAVE A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS LOCALLY ELECTED ENTER AND RESPONSIVE TO THEIR COMMUNITIES- AND THAT I UNDERSTAND AND I HOPE THE AUTHOR WILL CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT THERE'S- NOTHING IN CURRENT LAW THAT LIMITS THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE DISCLOSURES. THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED IN THIS BILL. UNTIL THE LOCAL LEVEL AT COMMUNITIES FEEL LIKE THEY WANT TO GO FURTHER THAN THAT DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT THAT'S ALREADY ON ON THE AND THE LAW. THAT THEY COULD- ACT. ACTIVATE AND- AND ADVOCATE AND- AN AN APPEAL FOR. ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES AS PROPOSED SO I I'D I'D LIKE THAT CLARIFICATION- MAYBE IN HIS CLOTHES- BUT IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT- THAT AND WHATEVER THE WAY THE TESTIMONY FROM A WITNESS A FEW MOMENTS AGO INDICATING WHERE DISTRICTS HAVE NOT COMPLIED I THINK THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE TODAY AND I THINK WE- NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS- FOLLOW THE LAW. AND IT IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT HAPPENS ON THIS BILL TODAY I THINK THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT- I WOULD WANT TO BE SURE THAT THAT IS FOLLOWED UP ON- BECAUSE THAT'S WELL WHAT WE EXPECT WE PASSED THOSE RULES AND THOSE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE DISTRICT WILL COMPLY WITH THE SITE I TAKE THAT VERY VERY SERIOUSLY. BUT FOR ME THE LIMITATION IN SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY IS THIS ISSUE OF LOCAL CONTROL I DON'T DISAGREE ABOUT TRANSPARENCY BUT IT SEEMS THAT THAT- YOU DO THAT THAT THE CASE FOR A STATE WIDE REQUIREMENT AS PROPOSES. FOR ME IS A LITTLE OVER REAHING AND IT'S A TOUGH FOR ME TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF PARENTS AND THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHO ARE CONCERNED AND WANT THAT INFORMATION THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION UNDER THE LAW TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CENTER CORTESE. YES PRIVILEGE WHEN THINK. SENATOR DOLE FOR- HIS EFFORT IN HIS CONTINUING A PERSISTENCE- I THINK OF LARGELY FUELED BY AN INTEREST IN TRANSPARENCY HERE BUT I WANT TO ASSOCIATE- MY REMAINING COMMENTS WHICH REALLY JUST HAVE TO DO WITH- MY NO VOTE TODAY WITH- MY TO THE- CAUGHT THE TWO COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE JUST PREVIOUS TO ME SO- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WON'T REPEAT A RE HASH- THE BALANCE BETWEEN LOCAL CONTROL AND SOME OF THE DETAILS- THAT THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. WITH IMPLEMENTATION SO. THANK YOU- FOR BRING IT FORWARD AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO A CONTINUED DISCUSSION. IN THE TIMES AHEAD THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE CENTER DOLLY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NINETY. FIRST LOSS YET TO ANSWER MISTER GLAZERS- QUESTION YEAH YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT- BUT I'LL TELL YOU I HAD THE REASON I GOT VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS BILL. IS I HAD THE CONCERNED PARENTS OF ROCKLAND. WHO WHAT HAPPENED WAS THEY THE CURRICULUM WAS BEING TAUGHT THEIR KIDS CAME HOME AND THE- WE'RE EXPLAINING WHAT WAS BEING TAUGHT IS GOING ON LIKE THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT THEY'RE NOT TEACHING REALLY TEACHING YOU THAT AT THE STATE OR THE AND SO THEY WENT IN AND ACTUALLY TRY TO GET. SOME MATERIALS. AND HAD A HECK OF A TIME GETTING MATERIALS IN AND- WHEN THEY WERE REALIZE THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE CURRICULUM WAS PACKED AND- WAS AVAILABLE AND- WAS BEING TAUGHT- VERY OUTRAGED. AND BY THE MATERIAL. AND WHAT WAS BEING TAUGHT AND IT WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS SO. THERE'S A WHOLE HOST AND WE SAW THAT WHEN THIS BILL WITH HER BEFORE THERE'S AN- IDEA THAT CHOSE NOT TO BRING A BUNCH OF- BUT TO BRING THE- SUPPORT BECAUSE I SAW WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME I THINK IT VERY MUCH FRUSTRATED. THE PROCESS AND I. BET AND I DID DO THAT SO I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP ON THE STUFF I DON'T GET IT OUT HERE TODAY I WILL THEN RAMP IT UP AND- AND MAYBE MAYBE LEGISLATORS NEED TO HEAR FROM THE FOLKS IN OUR DISTRICT BUT WITH. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE- CONCERNED PARENTS OF ROCK AND WAS STATE THEY WERE BLOWN AWAY BY THE MATERIAL AND IT WAS VERY HARD TO GET. SINCE THEN THEY WENT OUT STATEWIDE AND TRY TO ACCESS MATERIALS AND IT'S VERY HARD TO DO NOT JUST IN THEIR DISTRICT OTHER DISTRICTS- AND WHAT HAPPENED ROCKING WAS THEY COMPLETELY CHANGE THE SCHOOL BOARD- OVERTURN THE SCHOOL BOARD AND SO. FOR ME IT'S LIKE I DON'T LIKE I'M AGREEMENT I MEAN IN AGREEMENT WITH. THE FACT THAT I DON'T LIKE STAND. STATE MINUTES I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR SIXTEEN YEARS TRUST ME. I RAN FOR THIS TO TRY TO STOP. THE STATE FROM DOING THAT BUT IN SOME CASES. THERE NEEDS TO BE IT AND THIS IS BASICALLY TRANSPARENCY SO- AND ON THE ON AND THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT COPYWRITING. IF IT'S COPYRIGHTED IS COPYRIGHTED IT WHETHER YOU'RE- YOU CAN GO PHYSICALLY LOOK AT IT OR GO LOOK AT ON THE INTERNET THIS IS BASICALLY JUST SAYING HEY THIS IS THE CURRICULUM I'M GONNA TEACH. ARE THE SCHOOLS GOING TO TEACH. AT THIS TIME.AND HERE IT IS POSTED WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU FREIDA I THINK THE L. G. B. T. Q. ARGUMENT IS EVEN BETTER THEY SHOULD WANTED UP THERE AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING WHAT THEY WANT TAUGHT RIGHT WE DO ALL KINDS OF LEGISLATION HERE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE AT. THAT THEIR GROUP HAS ACCESS TO. THE INFORMATION AND THAT THEIR STORIES BEING TOLD THE WAY THEY WANT TO BE TOLD SO. FOR ME IT'S LIKE. AGO IT WORKS BOTH WAYS WHETHER YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION IT'S ABOUT. EDUCATION GETTING PARENTS ENGAGE SO FOR THOSE REASONS- I WOULD. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY AND BEFORE THE PROMOTION I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. THAT YOU DID ACCEPT ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE- PREVIOUS AUTHOR WITH ASKED HIM TO TAKE. AND ALSO BE VERY CLEAR THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE CURRENT CURRICULUM. WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR HATE IT THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE A CURRENT CURRICULUM THIS JUST PROVIDES ACCESS TO PARENTS. WHICH I BELIEVE AND I THINK AS A PARENT MY KIDS ARE GROWN. UP BUT I THINK AS A PARENT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO VIEW THAT SOCIAL VERY CLEAR IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE CURRENT CURRICULUM. HOW DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL. REMOVED THANK YOU SENATOR OTOBO. WE HAVE A PROMOTION- AND CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM ELEVEN SB TWO SEVENTEEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA. HI LEYVA HI- TROLENBERG BY THE TROUBLED BY COURTESY NO. CORTES A DE. DELI HI. SALLY I. PLEASE YEAH. PLEASE NO MCGUIRE. PAN. PENAT VOTING. THANK YOU WE WILL LEAVE THAT BILL ON CALL A MEMBER AND OUR OF THOSE. WE ARE DONE WITH THE- MEMBER BILL AND BILL AND AS A CHAIR HAVE SOME TO PER. I AM GOING TO HAVE TO GET OVER TO MY VICE CHAIR. THANK. IF YOU GIVE ME ONE SECOND TO GRAB MY ITEMS. WELCOME SENATOR LEYVA YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL OR SENATE BILL FIFTY ONE WE'RE GONNA START WITH. FOR THE TWENTY START WITH. THERE ARE TWO FIVE OKAY YES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PLACE OUR WHOLE MEMBER. I AM VERY EXCITED TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY S. B. TWO OH FIVE TO PROTECT SCHOOL EMPLOYEES N MEDICAL LEAVE ACT THIS BILL WOULD REPEAL THE FORTY YEAR OLD CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRING PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE EMPLOYEES INCLUDING TEACHERS TO PAY FOR THE COST OF THEIR SUBSTITUTES WHILE ON EXTENDED LEAVE. AFTER EXHAUSTING ALL OF THEIR AVAILABLE SICK LEAVE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES MAY QUALIFY FOR UP TO FIVE ADDITIONAL MONTHS OF EXTENDED LEAVE UNDER THIS BILL DURING THE EXTENDED LEAVE THE EMPLOYEES PAY IS REDUCED BY THE ACTUAL OR ESTIMATED COST OF THEIR SUBSTITUTE KNOWN AS DIFFERENTIAL PAY. YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT THE EXISTING DIFFERENTIAL PAY LAW WAS HEAVILY CRITICIZED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WHAT A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER. FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS REQUIRED TO PAY FOR HER SUBSTITUTE WHILE UNDERGOING BREAST CANCER TREATMENT. THE TEACHER SITUATION RECEIVED NATIONAL ATTENTION WHEN I GO FUND ME PAGE WAS LAUNCHED BY PARENTS FOR THE TEACHER. THE POLICY OF DEDUCTING THE COST OF A SUBSTITUTE FROM A SCHOOL EMPLOYEES PAY DOES NOT AFFECT ALL EMPLOYEES EQUALLY. IN SOME CASES THE COST OF THE SUBSTITUTE CAN EVEN EXCEED THE SALARY OF THE EMPLOYEE. WHEN THIS HAPPENS IT HAPPENS THE EMPLOYEE ACTUALLY EARNS NOTHING WELL I'LL ON EXTENDED LEAVE WHICH IS PRECISELY WHEN THEY NEED THEIR SALARY THE MOST SINCE THEY MAY BE FIGHTING CANCER OR A SIMILAR LIFE THREATENING ILLNESS. WELL OBVIOUSLY. ALSO STILL HAVING TO PAY HOUSEHOLD BILLS. AND THESE IMPACTS AFFECT VARIOUS GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES DIFFERENTLY. EARLY CAREER EMPLOYEES DO NOT HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF STORE OF LEAVE STORED AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO FEEL THE HARMFUL IMPACTS OF THE CURRENT POLICY. MOREOVER FEMALE EMPLOYEES AT A PREVIOUSLY USED THEIR SICK LEAVE DURING OR AFTER PREGNANCY ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO EXHAUST. LITTLE SICKLY THEY HAVE ALL REMAINING. ON CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATORS AND OTHER SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ARE AT THEIR MOST VULNERABLE EXISTING STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT THEY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR EMPLOYERS COST OF HIRING A SUBSTITUTE THIS IS JUST WRONG. FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR STAFFING CLASSROOMS ENSURING THAT OUR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE SAFE AND CLEAN SHOULD NOT FALL ON OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL COMMUNITY COLLEGE EMPLOYEES MUST FOR MUCH LESS THOSE THAT ARE BATTLING AN ILLNESS OR AN INJURY. JOINT JOINING ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL TWO OH FIVE OR CAITLIN VEGA REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION INSEPARABLE REPRESENTED CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU. FOR THANK YOU SENATOR LEVEL NUMBER BONTA ANYONE ONE DISS TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF- WE HAVE LEAD SUPPORT- WITNESSES CAITLIN VEGA.

TWO OH FIVE UNLIKE MANY CALIFORNIANS I HAVE SPENT THE LAST YEAR TAKING CARE OF MY MOM TO CANCER TREATMENT THANKFULLY AT THE UNION RETIREES SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MISSING WORK BUT LOSING INCOME BUT MANY WORKERS ARE NOT SO LUCKY. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DEDUCT THE COST OF THE SUBSTITUTE FROM THE WORKERS PAID LEAVE OR TO PROVIDE JUST A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF REGULAR WAGES FEW WORKING FAMILIES CAN AFFORD TO LIVE ON SUCH REDUCED WAGES AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WHO ARE THE LOWEST PAID WORKERS IN EDUCATION WHEN SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ARE FACING SERIOUS ILLNESSES OR INJURIES THAT REQUIRED THEM TO NEXT WEEKS OR MONTHS OF WORK THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WONDER HOW THEY WILL MAKE ENDS MEET. THEY DESERVE SOME PEACE OF MIND AS THEY RECOVER AND HOPEFULLY RETURN TO WORK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND WE APPRECIATE SENATOR LEYVA FOR INTERESTING THIS INJUSTICE. THANK YOU.

OKAY ALL RIGHT YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM VICE CHAIR MEMBERS SENATE BILL TWO FORTY SIX THE CHILD CARE STABILIZATION FORMULA WOULD ESTABLISH A SINGLE REGIONAL AS REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR CHILD CARE PRESCHOOL AND EARLY LEARNING SERVICES CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS A MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES THESE IMPORTANT SERVICES TO OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS SPECIFICALLY IT HAS TWO DIFFERENT ONLINE SYSTEMS FOR REIMBURSING PROVIDERS THAT MEET TO DIFFERENT STANDARDS. THIS BIFURCATED RATE SYSTEM AND INADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT RATES COMPLICATE EFFORTS TO FUND AND DELIVER HIGH QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT MEET THE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS OF ALL CHILDREN WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF THE CHILDREN THAT THEY ARE SERVING. ON A LINE TO SYSTEM APPROACH LIMITS ACCESS FAILS TO MAXIMIZE PROGRAM QUALITY AND IS FORCING MANY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS OUT OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE CURRENT SYSTEM RESOURCE EXPENDITURE SHOULD BE STREAMLINED AND EXPANDED IN THE FOLLOWING WAY COMPENSATE TEACHERS AND PROGRAMS FOR THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE. ON BE RESPONSIBLE TO THE ECONOMIC DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZE THE COSTS OF MEETING VARYING QUALITY STANDARDS INCENTIVIZE HIGH STANDARDS AND PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH BASED QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN JUST ONE AND NINE CHILDREN ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVED THOSE SERVICES. HOWEVER THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS TREMENDOUSLY INCREASED THE NEED FOR CHILD CARE AS WE THOUGHT PROVIDER SHUT THEIR DOORS AND THOSE THAT REMAINED OPEN OR FINANCIALLY SQUEEZED TO THE LIMIT NOW MORE THAN EVER IT IS TIME TO RESTRUCTURE HOW WE REIMBURSE PROVIDERS TO ALLOW THEM TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN AND SERVE MORE CHILDREN AFTER ALL WITHOUT CHILD CARE THERE REALLY IS NO ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THROUGH THESE REFORMS CALIFORNIA CAN ACHIEVE A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND MAXIMIZE. PUBLIC BENEFIT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE STONE A SNEERING. WITH THE CHILD RE CENTER IN SOME. AND ALSO MEAN ABOUT THE FROM EVERY CHILD CALIFORNIA MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTED TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT WE HAVE TO LEAD- WITNESSES- LET ME BEGIN WITH THAT. DONIS NEED SNEERING JR. GOOD MORNING AS CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS THOMAS NARINDER AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER AS WELL AS THE CHILD CARE ALLIANCE OF LOS ANGELES WE ARE. PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND HAVE WORKED FOR MANY YEARS HE TRIED TO SIMPLIFY AND MODERNIZE HOW WE PAY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HAS OVER A ONE HUNDRED YEAR HISTORY OF PROVIDING A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CHILD CARE AND EARLY LEARNING SERVICES. AND THROUGH THAT EVOLUTION HAS DEVELOPED A BIFURCATED REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM HALF OF THE SYSTEM IS REIMBURSED THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATES. WHICH IS THE DAILY RATE THAT IS THE SAME REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU ARE IN CALIFORNIA. AND DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE REGIONAL COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS. IN HAS ALSO FALLEN PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND- AND IS NO LONGER COMPENSATING AT ACT. QUICKLY FOR THE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED. THE OTHER HALF OF THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE SURVEY WHICH IS CONDUCTED EVERY TWO YEARS AND REQUIRED. BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE WORKED- NEED OF A I WERE CULTURE- A WAR GROUP THAT PUT TOGETHER A WHITE PAPER AND CONSULTATION WITH HUNDREDS OF STAKEHOLDERS AROUND CALIFORNIA. AND WE PUT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TOGETHER INTO WHAT IS. THAT IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY. THE BILL HAS WIDE SUPPORT BY PROVIDERS IN THE FIELD. AND IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ADD ANOTHER LEYVA MENTIONED CONSOLIDATE INTO A SINGLE STRUCTURE THAT ADEQUATELY REFLECTS THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. WE WORKED ON A SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR AND WERE UNSUCCESSFUL- BUT LARGELY BECAUSE WE WERE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO ALIGN WITH THE WORK OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE SHE AND THAT PLAN WHICH WAS RELEASED IN NOVEMBER. DID LIFT UP THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OUR WORKGROUP AS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU NEEDED TO UNIFY FUNDING AND ADVANCED EQUITY IN OPPORTUNITY IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND CARE. TO THE QUOTE FROM THE REPORT DIRECTLY THE STATE THREE A CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT RATE STRUCTURE IN OVERLY COMPLEX IN AN EQUITABLE AND NEEDS TO BE BETTER ALIGNED. AND THIS GOAL CAN BE ACHIEVED BY FOLLOWING PREVIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE RATE REFORM WORK GROUP. WE WHERE WE HAVE MATT WITH THE AUTHORS OF MASTER PLAN AND MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BILL WE HAD IN PLACE BEFORE. AND REALLY FEEL STRONGLY THAT- WE NOW HAVE A STRUCTURE THAT WILL HELP MOVE US FORWARD- LASTLY THE QUOTE AGAIN FROM THE MASTER PLAN ADOPTING A NEW REIMBURSEMENT RATE STRUCTURE PROVIDES IN ANCHORAGE TRANSFORM THE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE SYSTEM AROUND THE KEY VALUES. OF EQUITY INCOME ALREADY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WILL MOVE NEXT WITH US LEAD. SUPPORT WITNESS NINA. IS IT BUT THE MOVIE MOVIE. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS NINA B. T. I. IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AVERAGE HOW CALIFORNIA A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING SIXTEEN HUNDRED EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROVIDERS- ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE ARE ALSO A CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL ADDS OUTLINED SB TWO FORTY SIX OFFERS SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE BIFURCATED RATE REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. NEW RATE STRUCTURE WILL INCLUDE ALL STATE CONCERT I JUST HER GROUNDS THAT FOUNDATION OF THE MODERNIZE RATE STRUCTURE IS THE BASE RATE SH WHEN FULLY PHASED IN THE BASE WEIGHT WILL REPLACE THE EXISTING RATE SYSTEMS AND WILL BE APPLIED TO ALL PROGRAM TYPES SBI'S BASE RATE WILL BE ADJUSTED FOR MARKETS AND JONES TO REFLECT DIFFERENT COST OF LIVING THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF. CALIFORNIA PROGRAM HERE FOR PROGRAM TYPE I SISTER AND CHARACTERISTIC OF THAT SHOW START THE BAY RATE IT CAN. WITH RECOMMENDED FROM MONSTER PLANT EARLY. AND WILL BE INCREASED ANNUALLY. THE NEW REIMBURSEMENT RATE WELL OFF TO INCENTIVIZE QUALITY AND PARTICIPATION IN QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS TO IMPROVE CHILD OUTCOMES THROUGH EIGHT QUALITY FACTOR. ALL PROVIDERS THAT MEET DEFINED QUALITY STANDARDS WILL RECEIVE THE BASE RATE AND THE QUALITY FACTOR. NEEDLESS TO ENCOURAGE ALL PROVIDERS REGARDLESS OF PROGRAM TYPE TO ENRICH THEIR PROGRAM ENVIRONMENT AND PAY FOR THE INCREASED COST OF THESE AFTERWARDS. LOCKSLEY THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A NEW CRISIS FACTOR WHICH CAN BE USED TO DISTRIBUTE FUNDS TO CHILDCARE AND EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS SERVING CHILDREN AND ACCOUNTING EXPERIENCING A STATE OF EMERGENCY. AS WE KNOW THE DATE WITH THE CARIBBEAN PANDEMIC BEING ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE FUNDS DUE TO CRISIS AND EMERGENCY IS MORE TIMELY THAN EVER SH THIS CRISIS FACTOR MECHANISM CAN BE USED ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY OR STATEWIDE BASIS. WHEN A STATE OF EMERGENCY IS DECLARED SUCH AS THE PANDEMIC OR WILD FIRES EARTHQUAKES EXTRACTOR. THIS WOULD BE A SHORT TERM ADJUSTMENT FOR THE. DURATION OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS NEW RATE STRUCTURE SIMPLY THIS. RATE LIAM SO AND HOW. ALLOWING A MINOR MY ECHO APPROACH ALLOWING ALL PROGRAMS- THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET PAID FOR THE COST OF THE INVESTMENT.

THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IN THIS LEGISLATION AND THOSE WHO ARE BEHIND IT- I WANTED AND I DON'T THINK THAT YOUR- HERE DIMINISHES CT- CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND I. I I'M GONNA GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. SAY SOMETHING ON THAT IF YOU WISH BUT I DID WANT TO ASK IF YOU WOULD SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE OF DROPOUT RECOVERY. SCHOOLS IN THE UNIQUE PLACE THEY HAVE A AND APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR FEEDBACK TO ALL F US ON THAT ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER. WE ARE AND IN CONTACT WITH THEM AND WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT WE COULD DO TO POSSIBLY. MAKE SURE THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE MET BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS ARE MET AND IF THEIR CURRICULUM IS SUCH THAT IT IS ONLY. RECOVERY THEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THEM ON THAT. WELL THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT AND- I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- THERE'S HAD SOME MERIT TIME APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION AND- IF THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY I WOULD LOVE TO BE- ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. WE'D. LOVE TO HAVE YOU CENTER GLAZER THANK YOU. SENATOR YES OF. THANK YOU FOR I WANT TO THANK YOU ALSO FOR THE RESPONSE OF THE PREVIOUS QUESTION I APPRECIATE THAT THE CONCERNED- IF I CAN JUST EXPAND ON IT A LITTLE BIT THOUGH- AGAIN I'VE MADE THIS CLEAR TO ADVOCATES WHO WHO APPROACH ME UP ON THE BILL WITH REGARD TO THE CONCERNED ABOUT A DROPOUT RECOVERY AND SO FORTH- DROP. WILL HAPPEN I KNOW AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER IN THAT I KNOW IS A CHAMPION OF ADG WHO WORK WITH SILICON VALLEY EDUCATION FOUNDATION TO GO SCHOOL DISTRICT BY SCHOOL DISTRICT- OVER A FEW YEARS AGO TO GET EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM TO VOLUNTARILY COMMITTEE DIGI- IS HEREBY CULTURE THAT CAMPAIGN AND- I'M PROUD OF THAT SIZE WILL MAKE CLEAR- WHERE I'M COMING FROM. EVEN IN A CO TECH WORDS OUT RATE IN. THERE SHOULD BE. NOT JUST NOTICE IN MY OPINION BUT THERE SHOULD BE. AN OPPORTUNITY CREATED FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO DO WISH TO. PARTICIPATE IN AB G. CURRICULUM- THERE SHOULD BE AN AFFIRMATIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT AND I SEE IN IN THE BILL FOR TO BEGIN THERE'S FUNNY NO BALL PROGRAM TWENTY OF ALL. OF THAT PERHAPS IT OPPORTUNITY CAN BE CAN BE TIED TO. TO THE TO THE GRANT FUNDING THAT WILL BE NEEDED- EVEN FOR DROPOUT RECOVERY PROGRAM SESAY. OF FOR EXAMPLE TO COUNTY LIKE MINOR IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS- WHERE. CONSERVATION CORPS OPERATES AS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT TO SAY WE HAVE ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS WHEN YOU LEAVE HERE YOU CAN GO THERE AND CAN. THIS IS THIS IS HOW THE CONNECTION IS MADE NOT JUST- BASIC NOTIFICATION THAT WE DON'T HAVE IT- SO I DON'T WANT TO COMPLICATE. YOUR BILL- CENTER LEYVA I JUST THINK. IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT TRYING TO- BUT A- TO COME. ABOUT THAT DIFFERENT MODELS- THAT PERHAPS THERE'S AN ABILITY TO. TO MAKE IT MORE THAN I A CAR ABOUT OR- A MISSING IN ACTION TYPE- APPROACH BUT- AN AFFIRMATIVE REQUIREMENT THAT- OPPORTUNITIES BE CREATED FOR THOSE IN NEED- SECONDLY I HAVE A QUESTION. THEN THERE IS A AS A READ THE BILL I WASN'T CLEAR AS TO WHETHER THOSE DISTRICTS AS LIKE THE ONES I WAS JUST DESCRIBING WHERE I WAS INVOLVED IN CAMPAIGN WHO ARE. WHO HAVE UP TILL NOW YOU KNOW COMMITTED AND OBVIOUSLY THEY HAD THE LOCAL CONTROL TO DO THAT COMMITTED TO THE PROGRAM'S. REALLY DON'T NEED TO BE INDUCED TO. THE TWO EIGHTY G. BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT THE BILL CAUGHT TO PUT IT SORT OF MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT- GRANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE DISTRICTS SAID I'VE ALREADY DONE THE RIGHT THING SO THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE. THEY'RE IN THAT NOTE NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED CATEGORY. BUT THE REALLY GREAT POINT NO THE BILL DOES NOT DO THAT- WE DO HAVE SOME CUT OFFS ON FOR THE ELEAZER BECAUSE NOT DAILY EVERY DAILY IS STRUGGLING. AS YOU NOTE SOME OF ALREADY DONE THIS- IN YOUR HIM DOING NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED I THINK MOSTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS BILL WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO THIS BILL. IS BRING EVERYONE UP TO THE SAME LEVEL- BUT WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING FOR FOLKS WHO ARE WE DOING THE RIGHT THING- IT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BILL BUT SO NOTED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF I MAY JUST- TO THE SHERATON I DON'T. THINK WHATEVER. THAT COME OF A FORMAL. THE MONEY INTO SOME. OBVIOUSLY IT SHOULD BE. TO A MUCH BIGGER LIFT TRY TO. A DISTRICT FROM THE ZERO GROUND ZERO ALL THE WEIGHT EIGHTY G. AGAIN I KNOW THAT FIRST HAND BUT- OF THE PERHAPS THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO AT LEAST- HILL WHETHER SINCE THE- SECOND SERVICING COSTS AND SO FORTH FOR. A FOR OTHER DISTRICTS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING TO HELP THEM MITIGATE THE EFFORTS MADE- THAT SAID I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL I THINK IS HUGE YOU KNOW STEP FORWARD- IN IN YOU KNOW IT'S GREAT TO SEE- THE WHOLE STATE. ESSENTIALLY BEING ENCOURAGED TO COME ALONG ON SOMETHING- THAT NOT EVERYBODY IS DONE. THANK YOU. A SINGLE PARENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANT TO THANK OUR CHAIR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND MAKE NOTE THAT- BACK IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN I WAS PROUD TO- JOINT AUTHOR WITH THE CENTERS DELEON AND HERNANDEZ- THE- SIMILAR BILL- AND FACT IT ENDED UP BEING A BUDGET BILL SO THAT'S WHAT REFERS TO AND ANALYSIS UP TO GET TWO HUNDRED MILLION- TO. GET THE SCHOOL STATUS PROPORTION OF BIRTH ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND LOW INCOME. FOSTER USE- THOSE FUNDS SO THAT WE CAN BE SURE TO GET ACCESS TO EIGHTEEN G. EIGHT A. G. EDUCATION AS WELL AS CREATING MORE SLOTS THAT YOU SEE. FOR THEM AS WELL. AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S MANY API ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE. SUPPORTING THIS BILL I DO AGREE WITH CENTER CORTESE I MEET HERE WHAT THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNED ABOUT. BUT I DO THINK YOU KNOW THE PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS EVERY STUDENT SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO GO TO UC RIGHT I MEAN WE THOUGHT. MOST- PROBLEMATIC WAS THAT- REASON WE DID. THE REGIONALLY- S. B. TEN FIFTY BACK IN TWENTY- BACK IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN WAS IS THAT. YOU COULD BE A STRAIGHT A STUDENT AT A HIGH SCHOOL AND NOT BILL TO GET YOU SEE BECAUSE THE COURSES WEREN'T THERE. AT ALL. AND SO I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE CERTAIN SCHOOLS WHERE THEY MAY BE DEBT BURDEN SOME FOR THEM GIVEN THE SPECIFIC POPULATION ADDRESSING. BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN AFFIRMATIVE PATH FOR ANY STUDENT WHO IS ABLE TO DO IT TO BE ABLE TO GET THE EDG COURSES THAT THEY CAN HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT THEY HAVE THAT THEY ARE TALENTED AND- WHEN THE WILL AND ETCETERA I NINA. SHE THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS. BUT I WOULD ALSO AGREE WITH CENTER CORTESE THAT. IT'S NOT JUST A CARVE OUT. IT'S SOME SORT OF COMMITMENT THAT THERE'S A PATH FOR THEM IF YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT PARTICULAR SCHOOL THAT THEY WILL BE FURTHER AWAY. SO THEY COULD GET THE AG IF THEY CAN DO IT- WELL I THIS IS A YES THAT MANY OF THEM AND MAY BE ABLE TO AND SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO THEN PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION ARE PUBLIC- UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THANK YOU. AND THE EVENT THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND HAPPY IN THE BILL. THANK YOU FOR PAN. ANY OTHER COMMENTS I DO HAVE A COUPLE JUST TO VOTE TO FORCE CONVENIENCE FROM EDUCATION- I DO WANT TO PUT IN A PLUG RIGHT NOW I KNOW THAT THERE WERE SOME STUFF TO YOU STATED THE VERY BEGINNING ABOUT. ONLY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF STUDENTS GOING TO UC'S ARE CAL STATE IN CALIFORNIA BUT I DO WANT TO PUT IN A GOOD PLUG FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE EFFORTS THAT THERE HAS. THERE HAS BEEN IN THE STATE TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE OUR STUDENTS TO ATTEND A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THAT MIGHT BE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THOSE NUMBERS- SO JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT THAT IN THE PUBLIC AS WELL BUT THEY KNOW THAT- OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE BEEN REALLY WORKING HARD TO GET OUR STUDENTS TO GO ON THAT ROUTE. FOR VARIOUS REASONS OF COURSE SO JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT ANOTHER CONCERN- THAT I HAD OR NOT THIS IS NOT IT GET THE PREVIOUS ONE WAS NOT A CONCERN BUT JUST A COMMON- THE ONE. OTHER COMMENT THAT I HAVE IS THE CHARTER SCHOOLS- WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS IT'S A CHOICE FOR PARENTS TO HAVE THEIR STUDENTS ATTEND TO THAT SCHOOL. AND TO MANDATE- I FEEL A LITTLE AWKWARD MANDATE IN CHARTER SCHOOLS- WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO BECAUSE IT'S OPTIONAL FOR PARENTS TO ATTEND THAT SCHOOL AND IF IT DOESN'T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE. THEY THAT- EARNS WOULD LIKE THEN THEY HAVE THE TO. ACCESS TO SEE TO THE STUDENTS OUT AND PUT HIM IN. SCHOOL IF SUPPORT PUBLIC SCHOOLS. OR ENDING AND NOT GIVE THE SUPPORT TO CHARTER SCHOOLS SO- THAT'S ONE THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE CONSIDERED IN THIS BILL IS TO EXCLUDE OR CHARTER SCHOOLS BECAUSE THAT IS. OPTIONAL AND IF THEY DON'T IF THEY DON'T OFFER THIS COURSE. THEN PARENTS CAN OPT TO ATTEND. AND SUPPORT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS- IN ADDITION TO THAT AND I CAN ADDRESS ALL THESE IN MY CLOTHES OF THE GREAT NOTABLY WONDERFUL- AND IT. IN THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PUTTING FOR THIS- I'M ACTUALLY A LITTLE. DISHEARTENED TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY. TO DON'T HAVE THE MEANS OR THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A TO G. WHICH I THINK THIS WOULD BE A GREAT- FUNDING FORMULA TO SET SUPPLEMENT THAT BECAUSE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IT ITS LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STUDENTS. SUPPORTING COURSE WORK. AND OF COURSE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STUDENTS SUPPORTING COURSE WORK. THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING TO PAY FOR TEACHER TO ONLY TEACH ONE OR TWO STUDENTS. IN THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ABOUT IS ANOTHER CONSIDERATION THAT WE SHOULD BE- VERBALIZING OUT THERE AS FAR AS THE CHALLENGES FOR SCHOOL LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IS THAT SOMETIMES THEY DON'T OFFER COURSE WORK BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER THREE IS SUPPORTING IT. AND THEREFORE WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY'S GOING TO SUPPORT THOSE TEACHERS THERE SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VERMAAK MATTER AT THE YOU SENATOR. WE TALKED CLOSE EARLY BUT EXCELLENT THANK YOU SO- THANK YOU ALL FOR THE DISCUSSION I GREATLY APPRECIATED. CENTER CORTESE I WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR- QUESTION ABOUT THE FUNDING. THERE IS FUNDING THE FIFTY MILLION IN GRANTS COULD BE USED FOR SCHOOLS THAT ARE STRUGGLING. THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THE A THREE G. SO. IT IT GIVES IT A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING I HOPE THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW ME THIS IS MY SEVENTH YEAR AND- C. T. E. HAS BEEN A HUGE HUGE PART OF MY WORK HERE. IN ON IN THE SENATE. AS WELL AS COMMUNITY COLLEGES I'VE BEEN A HUGE COMMITTEE COLLEGE A- SUPPORTER AS SOMEONE WHO STARTED MY COLLEGE CAREER. AT MOUNT SAC IN THE WOMAN. WE WILL ALWAYS WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS THE OPTIONS THAT THEY NEED. I AGREE WITH YOU CENTER CORTESE THAT ALL WE DON'T WANT TO DO. PROBABLY JUST A CARVE OUT BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW A STUDENT COULD BE SPARKED BY SOMETHING EVEN RECOVERY STUDENT. THEY COULD SOMETHING THAT SPARKED HER INTEREST. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THOSE A THROUGH G. REQUIREMENTS TO GO TO A C. ISSUE. OR YOU SEE SO I THINK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOUR CONCERNS. FOR ME THIS IS ABOUT EQUITY IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR CHILDREN HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REACH THEIR FULLEST POTENTIAL. SO WITH THAT.

SB FIVE SIX SIX ALSO KNOWN AS THE STEPS STEPS TO ECONOMIC PARITY IN SALARIES ACT WILL CORRECT SALARY INEQUITIES THAT HAVE IMPACTED OVER TWENTY THOUSAND C. ISSUE SUPPORT STAFF FOR DECADES IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE CSU UNILATERALLY DECIDED TO ELIMINATE SALARY STEPS FOR THEIR STAFF SALARY STEPS WHICH HAD BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS. THEY ARE THE ONLY STATE AGENCY TO ELIMINATE SALARY STEPS FORT SUPPORT STAFF AND IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY STATE AGENCY THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE SALARY STEPS AS A RESULT STAFF HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROGRESS IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER COMPARED TO THEIR COUNTERPARTS FOR EXAMPLE ON AVERAGE NEW HIRES EARNED ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS PER MONTH MORE THAN THEIR PEERS WHO DO THE EXACT SAME JOB. THIS MARGINALIZATION ISN'T ONLY UNFAIR IT'S DEMORALIZING FOR THE HARD WORKING EMPLOYEES A KEEPER CSU SYSTEM FUNCTIONING MANY OF THE EMPLOYEES AFFECTED BY THESE INEQUITIES ARE THE LOWEST PAID CSU EMPLOYEES SUCH AS CUSTODIANS AND GROUNDSKEEPERS SB FIVE SIX SIX WILL FIX IS UNFAIR SALARY STRUCTURE. BY RESTORING 5% SALARY STEPS FOR TWENTY THOUSAND C. ISSUE SUPPORT STAFF INCREASE PARITY WITH CALIFORNIA'S TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE OTHER STATE AGENCIES WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND STATE EMPLOYEES. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT TODAY.

WE ARE GRATEFUL TO HAVE RECEIVED STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE PAST AND HOPE IT WILL CONTINUE. THESE ARE NOT SALARY RAISES RAISES ARE PART OF OUR CONTRACT GIVEN TO ALL EMPLOYEES. SALARY STEPS ARE MERIT BASED INCREMENTAL INCREASES RESULTING FROM A POSITIVE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION BY A MANAGER. FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE CSU HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO REINSTATE SALARY STEPS DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE EXISTING CALORIE STRUCTURE AND THE INABILITY AND EMPLOYEES TO EARN A FAIR AND EQUITABLE REYES. THE INABILITY BY SUPPORT STAFF TO MOVE THROUGH THE SALARY RANGES ALREADY SENATOR LEE BUT- MENTIONED. IT IS JUST A MORALIZING TO HAVE EXISTING CLASSIFICATION ON THE SAME CAMPUS FOR MANY YEAR YET HAVE YOUR COUNTERPART MAKING MORE MONEY THAN YOU. AND EMPLOYEE SALARIES BECAME MARGINALIZED THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHT. HERMAN SEE IF YOU MANAGEMENT POSITIONS GREW AT TWICE THE RATE OF SUPPORT STAFF. WITH ANNUAL EARNINGS AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. THE OUTER AUDITOR CONCLUDED THAT THE CSU COULD NOT JUSTIFY THE GROWTH IN MANAGEMENT POSITIONS OR OTHER COMPENSATION. EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN STATE AUDIT REVEALED A CSU BUDGET SURPLUS AN OUTSIDE ACCOUNT THAT HAD GROWN TO FOUR BILLION OF WHICH TWO BILLION OUR ON GOING DISCRETIONARY FUNDS. THAT CAN BE USED FOR CSU OPERATIONAL COST. GOVERNOR BROWN AND GOVERNOR NEWSOM BOTH DIRECTED THE CSU TO PURSUE A NEGOTIATED RESOLUTION AND REVIEW THE COMPENSATION AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY. LOWEST WAGE EMPLOYEES. ALTHOUGH WE SOON BEGAN. WE WILL SOON BE A MANAGED LABOR TO RE OUR FOR. I REQUEST YOU BARGAIN SALARY YEAH HAVE MOSTLY BEEN IGNORED BY THE CSU ADMINISTRATION. OUR EMPLOYEES SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO WORK WITHOUT MERIT PAY THAT OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CSU IS ALLOWED TO ACCRUE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND SERVE MY CLOUT WELL IN REVENGE PRESIDENTIAL ACTIONS IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND JUST WRITING COULD REALLY QUICKLY SUPPORT.
