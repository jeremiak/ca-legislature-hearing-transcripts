ASSEMBLYMEMBER TODD GLORIA WHO COULD NOT BE WITH US WE ASK ME TO PRESENT TO YOU HIS BILL AB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT. ALL THIS BILL AIMS TO ENHANCE THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS BY PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF STUDENTS TO WEAR CULTURAL AND. CULTURAL ADORNMENTS AT GRADUATION CEREMONIES UNDER EXISTING LAW SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE PERMITTED TO DEVELOP REASONABLE DRESS CODE POLICIES THAT FOSTER A POSITIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. AND PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT. UNFORTUNATELY SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE ONLY UNJUSTLY ENFORCED THEIR DRESS CODE POLICIES TO PROHIBIT STUDENTS FROM WEARING APPROPRIATE CULTURAL DORMANT AT GRADUATION. THESE INCIDENTS REVEAL THE STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE BEING PREVENTED FROM RECOGNIZING THEIR CULTURAL TRADITION WELL CELEBRATING A PERSONAL MILESTONE. FOR ALL STUDENTS BUT FOR ALL STUDENTS BUT FOR NATIVE AMERICANS IN PARTICULAR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION IS A SIGNIFICANT OCCASION. AMONG AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVE STUDENTS A HIGH% SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE IS SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT. THE LOWEST OF ANY RACIAL ETHNIC DEMOGRAPHICS IN THE UNITED STATES. REGRETTABLY THIS PROBLEM IS NOT UNIQUE TO NATIVE AMERICANS IN IN NEARBY ELK GROVE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENT WAS ESCORTED OUT OF THE SCHOOLS GRADUATION VENUE. AFTER REFUSING TO REMOVE A KENTE CLOTH. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN A BELLWETHER FLAYED INCLUSIVITY. BY PROTECTING A PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO WEAR CULTURAL DORM AT CEREMONIES AB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT PROTECTS OUR STUDENTS RIGHTS TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. THIS BILL MAY SOUND FAMILIAR. THIS COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY THREE LAST YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY THE GOVERNOR VETOED AB TWO THIRTY THREE CITING THE BELIEVE THAT SCHOOL ELECTED SCHOOL BOARDS ARE BEST POSITIONED TO MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT GRADUATION WITH A TIRE UP UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE AUTHORS HOPING TO SIT DOWN WITH THE OPPOSITION TO DISCUSS A POTENTIAL COMPROMISE WILL MAKE CLEAR STUDENTS RIGHTS TO WEAR CULTURAL DORMA GRADUATION WITHOUT ELIMINATING OR REDUCING LOCAL CONTROL. I HAVE A WE HAVE ONE WITNESS YOU TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. AB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT IS AN IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF STUDENTS TO WEAR RELIGIOUS CEREMONY OR CULTURAL ADORNMENTS THAT SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONIES. THE SEMINAL U. S. SUPREME COURT CASE OF TINKER VERSUS TO MOINS INVOLVED EXPRESSION BY THE WEARING OF AN ITEM IN THAT CASE BLACK ARMBANDS TO PROTEST THE VIETNAM WAR. THE SUPREME COURT HELD THAT STUDENTS RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION ALLOW THIS TYPE OF PROTEST SO LONG AS IT DID NOT DISRUPT THE OPERATION OF THE SCHOOL. THIS TYPE OF EXPRESSION IS ALSO PROTECTED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. STUDENTS SHOULD EQUALLY BE ABLE TO WEAR ADORNMENTS AS AN EXPRESSION OF THEIR RELIGIOUS OR CULTURAL HERITAGE HERITAGE AGAIN AS THE BILL MAKES CLEAR SO LONG AS DOING SO IS NOT DISRUPTIVE. BY CLARIFYING THE LAW AB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT WILL PROTECT STUDENTS RIGHTS AND OFFER GUIDANCE TO SCHOOL DISTRICT SO IT'S TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR UNNECESSARY LITIGATION. AS ANYONE WHO HAS ATTENDED A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY KNOWS IT IS A JOYFUL AN IMPORTANT CEREMONY FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IS A TIME FOR CELEBRATION NOT ONLY OF THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS AND WHAT HE OR SHE HAS ACCOMPLISHED. BUT ALSO OF EVERYONE WHO HELPED GET THE STUDENT TO THAT POINT THE FAMILY AND THE HERITAGE OF THE STUDENT. IT IS ALSO THE MARKING OF AN IMPORTANT TRANSITION. STUDENTS WHO ARE MARKING THAT TRANSITION SHOULD CONSISTENT THERE COULD CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS BE ABLE TO WEAR THE ADORNMENTS THAT THEIR CULTURES USE ON SUCH OCCASIONS.

ASSOCIATE WITH THE ARE LEARNING. POLICY INSTITUTE AND CARRY CASUALLY DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT WITH A CALIFORNIA. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I WILL TURN IT OVER TO THEM. MISSING. GOOD AFTERNOON SURVEYING ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM TOWARD LOOKS AND SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. A AB SOME SIXTY ONE WOULD ADD HIS USUAL FOR SCIENCE PERFORMANCE TASK ASSESSMENTS TO CALIFORNIA'S ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. A PERFORMANCE TEST ASSESSMENTS WHICH FOCUS ON ON CIVICS EDUCATION AS WELL AS CRITICAL THINKING ANALYTICAL AND RESEARCH SKILLS. AT THE PERFORMANCE TAX ASSESSMENTS WOULD BE OPTIONAL TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO LOCALLY ADMINISTER R. SCORE AND MAINTAIN. THE BILL PERMITS THE STATE TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS SUCH EYES ADMINISTRATION GUIDES AS WELL AS PROFESSIONAL LEARNING DEVELOPMENT. I'M IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE STATE USHERED IN. A NEW AS A PARA OF STUDENT TESTING BY IMPLEMENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSESSMENTS FOR PROGRESS IN PERFORMANCE ALSO KNOWN AS THOMAS.

URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS MEASURE I HAVE WITH ME CARRIED ASHLEY DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. GREAT. GOOD AFTERNOON ANNA MER ON BEHALF OF THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE. IF YOU TAKE A DRIVING TEST YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED A PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT INACTION. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE MULTIPLE CHOICE WRITTEN EXAM BUT THE MOMENT WHEN THE INSTRUCTOR GETS YOUR CAR. AND YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO PARALLEL PARK. SIMILARLY WHEN IT COMES TO SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY AND CIVICS. IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO CONFUSE THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE THAT HE ASSESSED BY A STANDARDIZED TEST. WITH THE DEEPER LEARNING THAT CAN BE ASSESSED BY PERFORMANCE TASKS. THESE TASKS RANGE FROM ESSAYS AND OPEN ENDED PROBLEMS ON WRITTEN TESTS. THE CLASSROOM COMMUNITY BASED PROJECTS WHERE STUDENTS DEMONSTRATE SKILLS SUCH AS RESEARCH COLLABORATION AND CRITICAL THINKING. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT STUDENTS WHO EXPERIENCE INQUIRY PROJECTS LINKED TO PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT. PERFORMED BETTER ON MEASURES OF HIGHER ORDER SKILLS LIKE ANALYSIS OR EVALUATION. AS WELL AS UNTRADITIONAL STANDARDIZED TESTS. AND THIS APPROACH IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. A NEW LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE REPORT FINDS THAT AT LEAST SEVENTEEN STATES CURRENTLY ENCOURAGE OR REQUIRE THE USE OF PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT. IN WASHINGTON STATE TEACHERS WORK WITH THE STATE TO DEVELOP SOCIAL SCIENCE PERFORMANCE TASK. ELEVENTH GRADERS WRITE AN ESSAY IN WHICH THE STATE A POSITION ON A CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE THAT pINDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND THE COMMON GOOD. CITING A COURT CASE OR GOVERNMENT POLICY. THE STATE HAS DEVELOPED AN ONLINE RESOURCE BANK THAT INCLUDE STANDARDS LIKE TASKS RUBRICS AND SCORING GUIDES AND TEACHERS ENGAGE IN LOCAL SCORING OF STUDENT WORK. HERE IN CALIFORNIA A NETWORK OF MORE THAN FORTY SCHOOLS INTENDED STRIX CALLED THE CALIFORNIA PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT COLLABORATIVE. USE TEACHER DEVELOPED FORM PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS TO MEASURE STUDENT LEARNING. IN OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ALL TWELFTH GRADERS ENGAGE OF RIGOROUS RESEARCH BASE CAPSTONE PROJECTS% OFTEN WITH THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT COMPONENT.

HE'S TRYING TO FOLLOW THE RULES ARE SET BY OUR CHAIRMAN. OF MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MONEY IF LET'S FRANCIS AND I AM THE NATIONAL CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL CAMPAIGN FOR THE CIVIC MISSION SCHOOLS. A COALITION OF OVER SIXTY ORGANIZATIONS DEDICATED TO THE PROPOSITION THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE. IN TERMS OF CIVIC LEARNING THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE STATE. OF ALSO A. NATIVE CALIFORNIAN HAVING JUST RETURNED FROM WASHINGTON DC OR FORTY YEAR CAREER THERE AND NOW LIVE. IN EL DORADO COUNTY. I HAVE EXTENDED STATEMENT THAT ALL SUBMIT FOR THE RECORD BUT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TO CRITICAL NEED TO DO MORE IN THE AREA OF CIVIC LEARNING. WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF POLLS AND STUDIES IN WHAT NOT TO SHOW THIS NEED AND I'M JUST GOING TO CITE ONE. AND THAT IS THE RESULTS FROM. OF THE TWENTY FOURTEEN NATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS OF EIGHTH GRADERS. WHICH FOUNDED IN THE AREA OF CIVICS. FIFTY ONE PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS ARE PERFORMED AT THE BASIC LEVEL. TWENTY TWO PERCENT WERE FOUND TO BE PROFICIENT. ONLY TWO PERCENT PERFORMED AT THE ADVANCED LOCAL. THAT MEANS THAT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS TESTED. SCORED BELOW BASIC. THEY SIMPLY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT OUR INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENT OR HISTORY OR ANYTHING ELSE. AND THOSE ARE THE VOTERS IN THE FUTURE. AND WE NEED TO DO MORE. AND THERE'S YOU KNOW NAY PER. DOES NOT TO SEGREGATE TO STATE AT THE STATE LEVEL SO WE HAVE NO IDEA OF KNOWING HOW CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE DOING.

AND. IT WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS COMMENT IS UNIT TESTING HELPS IDENTIFY THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BUT ASSESSMENTS HELP CLOSE IT.

DIFFERENT STOPS ALONG THE YEAR THEY BE GIVEN ON IN AUGUST YOU KNOW WHEN THE SCHOOL YEAR STARTS IN SEPTEMBER IN THE TEST THE SUMMIT TESTS.
