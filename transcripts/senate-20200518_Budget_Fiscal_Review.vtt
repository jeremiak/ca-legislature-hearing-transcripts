COLLEAGUE FROM THE DEPARTMENT

00:16:48.574 --> 00:16:51.176
OF FINANCE PROVIDED I THINK IN

00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:52.911
MANY WAYS WE HAVE- SOME

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:54.747
SIMILARITIES WITH HOW WE USE

00:16:54.813 --> 00:16:57.149
THE PROPOSAL AND- YEAH WE

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:59.017
CATEGORIZE SOME THINGSA LITTLE

00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:00.986
BIT DIFFERENTLY AND ALSO WE

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:01.987
THINK THERE'S AN IMPORTANT

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:04.022
CHOICES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:05.858
MAKE IN THE COMING WEEKS SO WE

00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:08.160
JUST GO BACK TO- JANUARY

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:09.795
BRIEFLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.530
WHERE WE WERE AT THAT TIME THE

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:13.632
GOVERNOR PROPOSED BUDGET WITH

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:16.335
A- PROJECTED SURPLUS OF ALMOST

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:19.471
SIX BILLION DOLLARS. AND THE

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:22.007
OUTLOOK WAS MUCH BRIGHTER AT

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:23.776
THAT POINT. BUT THEN AS WE KNOW

00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:26.245
WE WERE STRUCK BY THIS- GLOBAL

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:28.380
PANDEMIC THAT THROUGH THE STATE

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:29.848
AND THE NATION AND THE GLOBE

00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:32.418
REALLY INTO A SEVERE. ECONOMIC

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:34.486
RECESSION THAT THAT NOT ONLY

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:37.489
WAS SEVERE BUT TOOK TOOK EFFECT

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:39.425
ON VERY QUICKLY. AND AS A

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:41.560
CONSEQUENCE OF THAT- THIS STATE

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:44.129
REVENUES. THE OUTLOOK FOR STATE

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:45.531
REVENUES DETERIORATED

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:50.436
SUBSTANTIALLY. AND RT AS AS- AS

00:17:50.502 --> 00:17:52.371
WAS ALREADY MENTIONED THE

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:54.606
REVENUE PROJECTIONS FOR THE

00:17:54.673 --> 00:17:56.642
CURRENT YEAR IN THE BUDGET YEAR

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:58.877
WERE REDUCED BY FORTY ONE

00:17:58.944 --> 00:18:00.546
BILLION COMPARED TO THE JANUARY

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:02.881
ESTIMATE AND AT THE SAME TIME

00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:05.017
THERE IS A CORD EXPENSE

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:06.518
PRESSURE ON EXPENDITURES.

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:08.220
UPWARD EXPENDITURE CRUSHER WAS

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:10.756
IN TWO MAIN AREAS BOTH ON THE

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:12.090
DIRECT COULD BE RELATED

00:18:12.157 --> 00:18:14.126
RESPONSE ACTIVITIES BUT THEN

00:18:14.193 --> 00:18:17.729
ALSO AS A RESULT OF THE

00:18:17.796 --> 00:18:18.430
DECLINING ECONOMIC SITUATION.

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:21.400
IN THE NEED FOR MORE PEOPLE TO.

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:23.235
ENROLL IN OUR SAFETY NET

00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:25.270
PROGRAMS THERE IS A HIGHER COST

00:18:25.337 --> 00:18:27.539
THE CASELOADS IN OUR IN OUR

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.441
SAFETY NET PROGRAMS INADEQUATE.

00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:31.910
UPWARD PRESSURE ON ACROSS ALL

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:35.180
OF THIS- IN TAKEN TOGETHER-

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:37.316
RESULTED AND DIG THE GOVERNOR'S

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:39.384
ESTIMATE OF A FIFTY FOUR POINT

00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:40.853
THREE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:43.055
PROBLEM FOR THE FOR THE CURRENT

00:18:43.121 --> 00:18:44.590
AND NEXT YEAR. AND WHAT I HAVE

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:46.792
ON THE SLIDE BEFORE YOU ON THE

00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:49.394
FIRST LINE IS IN A SUMMARY OF

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:51.430
THE MAIN REVISION GENERAL FUND

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:53.198
XIN ANIME REVISION. WHAT YOU

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.634
SEE THERE IS AS WAS STATED

00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:57.503
HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN POINT

00:18:57.569 --> 00:18:59.037
FOUR BILLION IN REVENUES AND

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:01.373
TRANSFERS IF YOU THINK ABOUT

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.408
WHAT IT WAS IN JANUARY WAS A

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:04.710
HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE POINTS.

00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:07.179
SO THAT'S A NINE POINT 4%

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:09.414
DECLINE AND THIS FIGURE

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:12.017
INCLUDES. SIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:15.787
IN AND SOME REVENUE

00:19:15.854 --> 00:19:17.289
AUGMENTATION. THE EXTENDED. I

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:19.224
AM HERE SHOWS A HUNDRED AND

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:20.792
THIRTY THREE POINT NINE BILLION

00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:22.528
AND IN JANUARY THAT WAS A

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:23.662
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE POINT

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:27.533
WHAT SO THAT IS THE THAT IS A

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:31.937
pCHOICES THAT DOES THE GOVERNOR

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:34.706
PROPOSES TO MAKE IN THIS YOUR

00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:37.576
VISION. IN ADDITION IF YOU THAT

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:39.011
BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT

00:19:39.077 --> 00:19:40.712
BALANCE IT GOES FROM SIXTEEN

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:42.447
POINT TWO BILLION DOWN EIGHT

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:44.216
POINT FOUR BILLION. YEAH AND

00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:45.851
YOU KNOW THEN IT THIS IS A

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:47.920
ANOTHER BIG CHANGE BECAUSE IN

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:49.688
JANUARY WAS PROJECTED THAT THE

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:52.491
STATE WOULD END TWENTY TWENTY

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:53.325
TWENTY ONE WITH AN EIGHTEEN

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:55.060
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:56.528
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT BALANCE.

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:58.931
SIMILARLY THE SAFETY NET

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:01.767
RESERVE. GOES FROM NINE HUNDRED

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:02.334
MILLION DOWN TO FOUR HUNDRED

00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:04.836
AND FIFTY MILLION. SO THAT IS

00:20:04.903 --> 00:20:07.005
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AFTER THE

00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:08.607
GOVERNOR AND DEVELOPED HIS

00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:11.944
PROPOSED WAYS TO CLOSE TO FIFTY

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.779
FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR

00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:15.747
ARE PROJECTED BUDGET PROBLEM.

00:20:15.814 --> 00:20:17.583
MOVING TO THE NEXT SLIDE. I

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:18.817
WOULD LIKE ON THIS SLIDE TO

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:20.953
WORK KIND OF FROM LEFT TO RIGHT

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:22.721
IF YOU LOOK ON THE LEFT SIDE

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:25.357
THERE THE RED BAR WELL YOU SEE

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:27.192
REALLY IS THE BUDGET PROBLEM

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:28.594
THE FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.462
BILLION. AND THE WORK RIGHT

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:32.965
THESE ORANGE SMALLER BARS ARE

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:35.400
THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM

00:20:35.467 --> 00:20:38.136
EACH OF THESE PROPOSED AREAS OF

00:20:38.203 --> 00:20:40.105
THAT WILL REDUCE THE BUDGET

00:20:40.172 --> 00:20:42.174
PROBLEM. SO SOME OF THESE ARE

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.542
IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:45.310
CATEGORIES IN OUR OFFICES VIEW

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:48.880
ALL. YOU HAVE. DESCRIBED IT SO

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:49.982
MANY JUST BRIEFLY TELL YOU HOW

00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:52.784
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS. ON

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:54.319
THE FIRST ONE THE BASELINE

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:59.191
ADJUSTMENTS YES. OF COURSE TEN

00:20:59.257 --> 00:20:59.658
OF THE TOTAL COULD YOU

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:02.761
SOLUTIONS I DIDN'T. THINGS LIKE

00:21:02.828 --> 00:21:04.730
THE INCREASED MATCH FROM THE

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:06.398
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:09.067
STATE'S MEDI CAL PROGRAM BUT IN

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:11.803
IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES AND-

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.373
DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICE AREA. IT

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:17.376
ALSO REFLECTS AN ADJUSTMENT TO

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.478
THE BASELINE BY TAKING OUT WHAT

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:21.647
THE GOVERNOR HAD PROPOSED IN IN

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:25.617
JANUARY AND- WHEN YOU REMOVE

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:27.586
THOSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES AT

00:21:27.653 --> 00:21:29.454
THESE BASELINE ADJUSTMENTS. IN

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:31.890
ADDITION WE HAVE AS WAS

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:34.493
MENTIONED TO. THE USE OF BUDGET

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:35.794
RESERVES IN THIS CASE THEY

00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:38.563
REPRESENT ABOUT 15% OF THE

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.899
TOTAL SOLUTION PACKAGE AND

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:42.067
SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION ABOUT

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:43.001
IS FROM THE BUDGET

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:45.370
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT AND THE

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:47.773
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FROM

00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:48.340
THE STATE YOU KNOW RESEARCH.

00:21:48.407 --> 00:21:50.876
AND ENSURE THAT THERE IS SOME

00:21:50.942 --> 00:21:53.345
NEW AUGMENTATION AND THAT

00:21:53.412 --> 00:21:54.880
ACCOUNTS FOR AROUND 8% OF THE

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:58.417
SOLUTION AND IT IS NOT SO MUCH

00:21:58.483 --> 00:22:01.153
A BROAD BASED TAX PRIEST BUT-

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:03.488
FOR US EXPLORATIONS REVENUES

00:22:03.555 --> 00:22:06.625
THAT WOULD COME IN PARTICULARLY

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:10.295
IN THE CORPORATION. SO MEETING

00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:13.298
AT SIX OUR EXEMPTION BUT SOME

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:15.467
BUSINESSES FOR AND THAT WOULD

00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:17.469
RAISE ABOUTFOUR POINT FOUR

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:20.072
BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL THEN I

00:22:20.138 --> 00:22:22.507
THE NEXT ITEM IS THE LARGEST

00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:24.910
REDUCTION SHOWN ON THIS WHICH

00:22:24.976 --> 00:22:27.212
IS ADJUSTING THE K. FOURTEEN

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:29.414
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

MINIMUM GUARANTEED ACCOUNT FOR

00:22:32.884 --> 00:22:34.453
ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. OF THE

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:37.556
TOP BUDGET LUCIEN'S ALTHOUGH IT

00:22:37.622 --> 00:22:39.324
IS OFFSET TO SOME DEGREE BY

SOME OTHER A JOB INSTEAD A

00:22:41.793 --> 00:22:44.262
MENTION IN A MOMENT. ARE WE

00:22:44.329 --> 00:22:45.931
HAVE BEEN REDUCTIONS THAT

ACCOUNT 41819% OF THE SOLUTIONS.

00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:53.071
AND THESE ARE. IN IN KIND OF

THEN. AGAIN PERSON MORE

00:23:14.826 --> 00:23:17.596
TARGETED REDUCTIONS ALSO. THANK

00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:20.999
THINGS LIKE. YEAH AND SHE'LL

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:22.634
INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS FOR

00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:25.637
EXAMPLE AND THESE THESE

00:23:25.704 --> 00:23:27.372
SOLUTIONS IN TOTAL. PRESENTED

00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:33.145
ABOUT 18% OF. ALL THE SOLUTIONS.

00:23:33.211 --> 00:23:35.247
THEN IN THE NEXT CATEGORY WE

00:23:35.313 --> 00:23:36.948
HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED A

00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:41.653
CONSCIOUS AND THESE ARE. BUDGET

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.588
OF FISCAL TOOLS THE LEGISLATURE

00:23:43.655 --> 00:23:46.024
HAS AT ITS DISPOSAL ON THESE

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:48.593
INCLUDE THINGS LIKE- SPECIAL

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.395
FUND LOANS TO THE GENERAL FUND

00:23:50.462 --> 00:23:51.997
SO YOU'RE REALLY SHIFTING SOME

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:54.099
COSTS TO OTHER FUNDS OF THE

00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:56.234
STATE GOVERNMENT BASED ON A

00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:59.337
TEMPORARY BASIS. BUT THEY ALSO

00:23:59.404 --> 00:24:01.907
INVOLVES. OUR STUDENTS TIME SO.

00:24:01.973 --> 00:24:03.008
THAT WOULD BE THE EXAMPLE

00:24:03.074 --> 00:24:05.076
MENTIONED ABOUT THE CHANGING

00:24:05.143 --> 00:24:07.712
THEIR PLANS FOR THE NEXT FOR

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:09.981
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. RATHER

00:24:10.048 --> 00:24:10.515
THAN MAKING A SUPPLEMENTAL

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:12.250
PAYMENT WITH PAY DOWN THE LONG

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:14.119
TERM LIABILITY IT WOULD

00:24:14.186 --> 00:24:17.289
ACCELERATE- TAKE TAKE THAT THE

00:24:17.355 --> 00:24:18.323
SAME FINDS AND PUT IT TOWARD

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:20.959
THE CURRENT AND NEXT YEAR.

00:24:21.026 --> 00:24:22.828
CONTRIBUTION GO THE LONG TERM

00:24:22.894 --> 00:24:24.563
BENEFITS OF MAKING THOSE

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:27.132
SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENTS

00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:28.633
TO THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY. AND

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.569
THEN IN THE LAST CATEGORY OF

00:24:30.635 --> 00:24:32.337
OUR FEDERAL FUNDS BOAST AN

00:24:32.404 --> 00:24:34.506
APOLOGIZE THE CAUTIOUS OR ABOUT

00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:36.842
11% OF THE SOLUTIONS AND THEN

00:24:36.908 --> 00:24:39.144
THE CATEGORY ARE FEDERAL FUNDS

00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:41.379
WHICH MAKE UP ABOUT 7% OF THE-

00:24:41.446 --> 00:24:45.450
SOLUTION. THE INCLUDED. YOU

00:24:45.517 --> 00:24:52.090
KNOW THINGS THE- AT THE FEDERAL

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:54.359
CARES ACT FUNDING WHICH

00:24:54.426 --> 00:24:57.095
INCLUDED THE- OPEN RELIEF FUND

00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:58.730
GAINED ABOUT THAT THAT THE

00:24:58.797 --> 00:25:00.098
STATE WILL RECEIVE ABOUT NINE

00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:02.467
POINT FIVE BILLION OF THAT YEAH

00:25:02.534 --> 00:25:04.002
AND ALLOCATED TO. PROGRAMS LIKE

00:25:04.069 --> 00:25:07.639
HELL WORKS AND HOMELESSNESS AND

00:25:07.706 --> 00:25:09.007
PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH

00:25:09.074 --> 00:25:11.509
AND THOSE ARE WILL TOTAL ABOUT

00:25:11.576 --> 00:25:13.645
THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION FROM

00:25:13.712 --> 00:25:16.948
IN THOSE AREAS. AND THIS. IS

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:18.683
SORT OF A- THE SAME

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.952
INFORMATION. PRESENTED AND

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:22.754
SOMEWHAT A TABLE FORMAT WITH

00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:25.257
MORE DETAILS ON WILL PASS OVER

00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:28.960
THAT ONE. AND ON THE SCHOOL

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:31.830
REDUCTIONS I MENTIONED THAT

00:25:31.897 --> 00:25:34.132
THIS REPRESENTED THE LARGEST

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:36.468
ITEM ON OUR BORDER CHURCH BUT

00:25:36.534 --> 00:25:37.569
THERE'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO

00:25:37.636 --> 00:25:40.338
POINT OUT IS NOT IS ALTHOUGH WE

00:25:40.405 --> 00:25:41.206
ARE REDUCE ENGINE AT.

00:25:41.273 --> 00:25:42.474
OPPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.909
LEVEL TO THE MINIMUM CARE AND

00:25:43.975 --> 00:25:46.478
SHE- WE ARE OFFSETTING THAT AT

00:25:46.544 --> 00:25:48.346
LEAST IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND

00:25:48.413 --> 00:25:50.715
THE- BUDGET YEAR BY PROVIDING

00:25:50.782 --> 00:25:53.018
THE SCHOOLS WITH. US FIVE POINT

00:25:53.084 --> 00:25:54.953
EIGHT BILLION OF FEDERAL FUNDS

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.922
THESE FUNDS ARE WOOD IN THE

00:25:56.988 --> 00:25:58.223
MAJORITY OF THESE FUNDS WOULD

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.558
GO TO- MITIGATE AGAINST OUR

00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:04.496
LEARNING LAS THAT HAS LIKE WE

00:26:04.562 --> 00:26:05.096
ARE HERDERS OCCURRING BECAUSE

00:26:05.163 --> 00:26:07.732
OF. THE YOU KNOW SITUATION OUR

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:09.768
STUDENTS ARE IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:26:09.834 --> 00:26:11.403
AND THEN ANOTHER FIVE POINT

00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:13.004
THREE BILLION OF DEFERRALS SO

00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:16.007
THESE TWO ITEMS TOGETHER HELP.

00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:18.443
BRING BACK THE SUBSTANTIAL IF

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.278
NOT ALL OF THIS FUNDING TO THE

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:22.147
SCHOOLS IN THESE TWO YEARS. IN

00:26:22.213 --> 00:26:24.983
ADDITION THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.085
SETTING UP A NEW LONG TERM

00:26:27.152 --> 00:26:28.753
OBLIGATION FROM THE GENERAL

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.156
FUND TO THEIR SCHOOL RULES.

00:26:31.222 --> 00:26:34.526
THAT WOULD. THE MINIMUM

00:26:34.592 --> 00:26:36.227
GUARANTEED FUNDING LEVEL ON A

00:26:36.294 --> 00:26:37.629
SOMEWHAT HOT AT A SOMEWHAT

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:39.331
HIGHER PLATEAU GOING FORWARD

00:26:39.397 --> 00:26:41.132
ESSENTIALLY RAISING IT FROM

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:44.269
ABOUT 38% 240% OF GENERAL FUND

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:45.770
REVENUES. AND AT THE AT THE

00:26:45.837 --> 00:26:50.709
MINIMUM. AND SO. THAT WOULD

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:53.311
DRIVE BEGIN TO BE PAID TO THE

00:26:53.378 --> 00:26:55.580
SCHOOLS AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY

00:26:55.647 --> 00:27:05.657
TWO. NEXT I WOULD LIKE TO JUST

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:08.293
TOUCH ON THE CODED RELATED

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.563
FINDING. HERE THE MAIN MESSAGE

00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:13.865
THAT I WOULD HAVE- FOR THE

00:27:13.932 --> 00:27:15.133
LEGISLATURE IN THIS AREA IS

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.103
THAT THE LEGISLATURE THIS POINT

00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:20.205
IS NOT HAVE A VERY DETAILED

00:27:20.271 --> 00:27:21.773
WERE CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT THE

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.942
ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN IS. AT

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:27.579
THIS POINT THERE ARE STILL SOME

00:27:27.645 --> 00:27:31.082
MECHANISMS IN PLACE THAT WOULD.

00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:33.218
PROVIDE FOR FUNDING- DISCRETION

00:27:33.284 --> 00:27:34.919
OVER HOW TO SPEND FUNDING TO

00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:37.022
THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE THINK

00:27:37.088 --> 00:27:38.556
THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT

00:27:38.623 --> 00:27:40.091
TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT SOME

00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:42.961
OF THESE IDEAS BECAUSE- SOME OF

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:44.496
THE SOME OF THE PROCESSES THAT

00:27:44.562 --> 00:27:45.930
WERE PUT IN PLACE SUCH AS THE

00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:48.833
SECTION THIRTY SIX- CONTROL

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.102
SECTION THIRTY SIX PROCESS WERE

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:54.205
PUT IN PLACE JUST PRIOR TO BUT

00:27:54.272 --> 00:27:57.876
WHEN I JUST LAY YOU'RE GOING ON

00:27:57.942 --> 00:27:59.477
TO ONE SOCIAL DISTANCE. REQUIRE

00:27:59.544 --> 00:28:01.212
BUT NOW THAT IT'S NOT. QUITE

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:02.714
THE SAME WAY WE THINK THAT

00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:04.382
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO REVISIT SOME

00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:07.085
OF THOSE. AND WE HAVE SOME

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:09.387
SUGGESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:28:09.454 --> 00:28:13.691
TO CONSIDER ON THE SPOT. NOW

00:28:13.758 --> 00:28:15.493
HOW DO WE LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.496
OVERALL. WELL IN GENERAL WE

00:28:18.563 --> 00:28:20.532
THINK THAT THE MIX OF SOLUTIONS

00:28:20.598 --> 00:28:23.535
IS GENERALLY WELL BALANCED- IN

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:24.736
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:26.171
RECOMMENDED IN OUR SPRING

00:28:26.237 --> 00:28:27.972
OUTLOOK FROM JUST A COUPLE OF

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:30.608
WEEKS AGO BUT AT THE SAME TIME

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:31.643
WE THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT

00:28:31.709 --> 00:28:34.079
AND IN THE BEST OF THE WEB

00:28:34.145 --> 00:28:36.514
DEVELOPMENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE.

00:28:36.581 --> 00:28:37.982
SIR IN ORDER IS BOTH ON THE

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:39.818
FISCAL SIDE AND THE PUBLIC

00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:43.121
DECIDE AND SO ON ALTHOUGH THE

00:28:43.188 --> 00:28:44.489
GENERAL MIX OF SOLUTION SEEMS

00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:47.992
REASONABLE THE LARGEST

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:48.793
DIFFERENT PREFERENCES FOR. HOW

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.595
THEY ARE WAITED RULE THIS IS

00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:52.897
SIMPLE. COMPONENTS OF THE

00:28:52.964 --> 00:28:54.933
PROPOSED SOLUTIONS ARE.

00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:57.202
SECONDLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE

00:28:57.268 --> 00:28:59.604
PROPOSED REVENUE SOLUTIONS. WE

00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:03.108
THINK THAT THE IDEA OR- SO

00:29:03.174 --> 00:29:04.876
SPENDING THAT OPERATION NOT

00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:06.678
OPERATING LOSSES AND LIMITING

00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:08.580
TAX CREDITS FOR THE CORPORATION

00:29:08.646 --> 00:29:11.449
TAX OR A REASONABLE REASONABLE

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:13.751
PLACE TO START AND THEY ARE

00:29:13.818 --> 00:29:15.720
LESS BURDENSOME THAN A BROAD

00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:18.523
BASED TAX RATE INCREASE. LET'S

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.358
KEEP IN MIND THE DIRECT WITH

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:21.593
THEIR PRIMARILY REPRESENT

00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:24.195
REVENUE ACCELERATION YOU'RE NOT

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:25.763
AN ONGOING SOURCE OF READING.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.765
THEY'RE ALSO VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:29:27.832 --> 00:29:29.367
PREDICT BECAUSE OF CORPORATION

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:31.402
TAXES JUST THE TORIES FOR BEING

00:29:31.469 --> 00:29:32.704
DIFFICULT TO PREDICT FIRST

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.440
CALLS. AND WE THINK OF IT

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:37.442
THERE'S SOME RISK TO RELYING ON

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:40.044
THIS- AZAR'S SO COMPONENT TO

00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:42.914
THE SOLUTIONS AND WE SEE THAT

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:44.849
THERE IS POSSIBLY. AN ARGUMENT

00:29:44.916 --> 00:29:46.384
THAT SOME OF THE ESTIMATES IN

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:47.886
THE NAY REVISION ARE SOMEWHAT

00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:50.221
HIGH THEY SAID THOSE ACCOUNT

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:51.122
FOR ABOUT FOUR POINT FOR DOING

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:55.994
THIS SINCE. IN THE LAST I HAD

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.428
ONE WOULD SOMETHING NINE WAS IS

00:29:57.495 --> 00:30:00.198
THAT. OF THE- SPENDING REGARD

00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:01.900
SO OF THEM ARE. BUT OTHERS ARE

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:04.035
A LITTLE BIT ONE JUROR IN THERE

00:30:04.102 --> 00:30:06.571
STRUCTURE AND SO WE THINK THAT

00:30:06.638 --> 00:30:07.572
THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:09.374
CONSIDER IN SOME CASES MAKING

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.177
HORSE- STRICT. SURGICAL TYPES

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:20.485
OF REDUCTIONS. IN IN SOME AREAS.

00:30:20.552 --> 00:30:22.020
LOOKING AHEAD TO THE MULTI YEAR

00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:23.988
BUDGET CONDITION. THE GOVERNOR

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:25.757
DOES MAKE PROGRESS IN

00:30:25.823 --> 00:30:27.292
ADDRESSING- THE YOUNG GOING

00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:29.060
DEFICIT BUT AS I'M AS WAS

00:30:29.127 --> 00:30:31.062
MENTIONED THAT. THE MULTI YEARS

00:30:31.129 --> 00:30:32.597
STILL SHOWS IN YOUR BUDGET

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:34.365
PROBLEM FOR THE REMAINDER OF

00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:36.234
THE FORECAST RISING WHICH GOES

00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:38.937
YOUR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR.

00:30:39.003 --> 00:30:40.605
IT CREATES THIS NEW SIGNIFICANT

00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:42.707
ONGOING OBLIGATION FOR THE

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:45.643
SCHOOLS. AND ONE THING ABOUT

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.078
THAT IS THAT IN GENERAL OVER

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:50.081
TIME THE ENROLLMENTS ARE

00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:52.951
DECLINING STATEWIDE. AND EVEN

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:54.819
BEFORE ADDING THIS NEW

00:30:54.886 --> 00:30:56.621
OBLIGATION TO THE SCHOOLS WHICH

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:57.789
WOULD TOTAL ABOUT THIRTEEN

00:30:57.855 --> 00:30:59.390
BILLION ONCE IT'S FULLY

00:30:59.457 --> 00:31:02.493
IMPLEMENTED. THE SCHOOL FUNDING

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.429
WAS GOING TO INCREASE UNDER THE

00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:05.630
ADMINISTRATION'S REVENUE

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:08.533
FORECAST SUCH THEN EACH YEAR

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.934
OUR PEOPLE FUNDING WOULD

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:12.637
INCREASE BY ABOUT 5% WE JUST

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:13.538
THINK THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT

00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:14.906
TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT THIS

00:31:14.973 --> 00:31:17.108
BECAUSE- AT A TIME WHEN OTHER

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:18.543
PARTS OF THE BUDGET WILL BE

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.079
NECESSARILY SQUEEZED IN ORDER

00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:22.947
TO. BRING THE STATE'S FINANCES

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:25.883
BACK INTO ALIGNMENT IT WOULD

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.386
YOU KNOW BE SOMETHING THAT-

00:31:28.453 --> 00:31:30.488
YOU'D WANT TO BE QUITE

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:32.223
CONSCIOUS ABOUT MAKING THIS

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:35.426
CHOICE. WE ALSO TAKE WE ALSO

00:31:35.493 --> 00:31:37.462
HAVE SOME QUESTION WITH REGARD

00:31:37.528 --> 00:31:39.631
TO THE PENSION PROPOSALS. WOULD

00:31:39.697 --> 00:31:42.267
SHIFT COSTS TO THE FUTURE YEARS

00:31:42.333 --> 00:31:43.735
AS I SAID THERE'S ALSO A

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:46.404
PROPOSAL TO SPEND THE- ZERO

00:31:51.209 --> 00:31:53.244
FUNDING CONTRIBUTION FROM THE

STATE TO THE- ALISTAIR SYSTEM

00:31:56.047 --> 00:31:58.182
AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THAT

00:31:58.249 --> 00:31:58.750
SAID SOMEONE OF A DANGEROUS

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:02.186
PRECEDENT. AND WELL WE THINK

00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:03.755
THAT IT DOES MAKE SENSE AND IS

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:05.156
WARRANTED TO CONTINUE TO SEEK

00:32:05.223 --> 00:32:08.526
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. AS THE

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:10.194
CHAIR MENTIONED AT THE

00:32:10.261 --> 00:32:12.063
BEGINNING OF THE SESSION. WE

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.165
WERE JUST POINT OUT THAT AID IF

00:32:14.232 --> 00:32:16.000
IT DID COME THROUGH TWO WERE

00:32:16.067 --> 00:32:17.702
SIMILAR TO THE- FEDERAL

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:19.404
ASSISTANCE THE CAME WITH THE

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.371
AMERICAN REINVESTMENT IN

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:22.407
RECOVERY ACT IN TWO THOUSAND

00:32:22.473 --> 00:32:25.276
NINE. THAT AGES GENERALLY

00:32:25.343 --> 00:32:26.611
ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING TO BE

00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:28.446
VERY LIMITED SO IT WOULD BE IN

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:29.947
PLACE FOR ONE OR TWO YEARS

00:32:30.014 --> 00:32:31.983
PROBABLY. AND IF YOU THINK

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.284
ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS THAT THE

00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:35.486
GOVERNOR'S PUTTING FORWARD THAT

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:37.488
ARE SUBJECT TO THESE TRIGGERS

00:32:37.555 --> 00:32:38.856
THERE ALMOST ALL ONGOING

00:32:38.923 --> 00:32:41.959
PROGRAMS AND SO. ESSENTIALLY WE

00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:43.027
WOULD GET THIS TEMPORARY

00:32:43.094 --> 00:32:45.263
FUNDING AND THE ONGOING FINDING

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.565
WOULD BE TRIGGERED BACK ON. AND

00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:49.500
THEN YOU THE LEGISLATURE WOULD

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:50.368
BE FACED WITH A STRUCTURAL

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:53.037
BUDGET ISSUE IN THE SUBSEQUENT

00:32:53.104 --> 00:32:54.439

WE'RE TO PHASE OUT SOONER JUST

00:32:58.042 --> 00:33:00.044
ONE OTHER CONSIDERATION. LAST

00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:04.315
MEAL JUST BY SAYING. THE

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:06.117
GOVERNOR MAINTAINS IN HIS NAY

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:08.720

THERE'RE ALL TOGETHER NEW OR

00:33:10.922 --> 00:33:12.256
REORGANIZATIONS OF CERTAIN

00:33:12.323 --> 00:33:13.825
DEPARTMENTS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT

00:33:13.891 --> 00:33:15.827
OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT OR THE

00:33:15.893 --> 00:33:16.928
DEPARTMENT OF BETTER JOBS

00:33:16.994 --> 00:33:20.932
HIGHER WAGES AND WE THINK IF

00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:23.534
YOU TO CONSIDER THAT THE RECENT

00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:25.603
PAST THERE ARE TWO MONTHS OR SO

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.405
WHERE THE LEGISLATURE REALLY

00:33:27.472 --> 00:33:29.073
HASN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.976
HAVE FULL INSURANCE IN THE WAY

00:33:32.043 --> 00:33:33.878

JUST. SOME OF THESE. ISSUES TO

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:44.055
LATER AT POLICY PROCESS OR

00:33:44.122 --> 00:33:45.189
PERHAPS EVEN THE NEXT BUDGET

00:33:45.256 --> 00:33:48.025
CYCLE AND THEN FINALLY IN SOME

00:33:48.092 --> 00:33:51.329
OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS FOR

00:33:51.396 --> 00:33:54.265

00:34:03.074 --> 00:34:04.642
FROM SOME SHORTCOMINGS IN OUR

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:06.844

00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:07.612
LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE AN

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:10.248
ESPECIALLY LONG TIME TO REVIEW.

THE FUNDS ARE SPENT WE REALLY

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:25.096
THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:28.533
SHOULD BE SURE TO LOOK OUT FOR

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:32.303

SURE THAT WE ARE COMMUNICATIONS

00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:27.344
WITH THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY

00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:28.779
WORK THROUGH THE COMING MONTHS

00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:30.314
IT AGAIN I THINK FROM OUR

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:31.315

00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:43.627
OF FINANCE AND AS MY COLLEAGUE

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:45.696
POINTED OUT AND THERE HAS BEEN

00:42:45.763 --> 00:42:47.231
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. OF

00:42:47.298 --> 00:42:51.101
UNCERTAINTY AND- FLEXIBILITY

00:42:51.168 --> 00:42:52.469
THAT HAS REALLY BEEN NEEDED AS

00:42:52.536 --> 00:42:54.371
WE TRACK AND MANAGE THE FEDERAL

00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:56.307
FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE. AND WE

00:42:56.373 --> 00:42:58.943
WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE STATE

00:42:59.009 --> 00:43:01.145
FULLY SPENDS BE FEDERAL

00:43:01.211 --> 00:43:04.181
RESOURCES CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:05.249
FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED. TWO

00:43:05.316 --> 00:43:06.483
KILLER EARLY AS WE THINK ABOUT

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.485
THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:10.587
SAFETY AREA. BUT WE WANT TO

00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:12.890
REMAIN NIMBLE AS GUIDANCE HAS

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:16.093
EVOLVED OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.661
AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:19.563
MOVE ALL OVER THE COMING WEEKS

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:23.968
AND MONTHS. I BELIEVE THAT WE

00:43:24.034 --> 00:43:26.036
FULLY APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR

00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:27.671
THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE NIMBLE

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:29.773
AND BE A POWER TO RESPOND IN A

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:30.975
TIMELY MANNER FOR THE CRISIS

00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:31.976
WHICH IS WHY THE LEGISLATURE

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:34.345
PASSED. I'LL GIVE YOU THAT

BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:43:38.215 --> 00:43:42.286
THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION FIND A

00:43:42.353 --> 00:43:43.721
WAY TO BALANCE YOUR ABILITY TO

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:45.422
RESPOND TIMELY WITH A GOOD

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:46.857
KNOWLEDGE IN THE ROLE OF THE

00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:48.359
LEGISLATURE MUST PLAY TO

00:43:48.425 --> 00:43:49.860
PARTNER WITH YOU. TO MAKE

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:51.628

TO BE EXACT FROM THE DEFERRALS

00:59:38.708 --> 00:59:40.977
IN THIS IS A SIMILAR. MECHANISM

00:59:41.044 --> 00:59:42.011
THAT WE USED IN THE LAST

00:59:42.078 --> 00:59:43.947
RECESSION TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:44.814

THAT POSSIBLE I GOT ABOUT THREE

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:15.271
MORE QUESTIONS AFTER THAT BUT

THIS IS RELATED TO THAT

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.876

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:08.751
BE NINETEEN IS A MINUTE AWAY

THE STAND SO WE DON'T KNOW WHEN

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.732
IT WILL BE AN AXIOM WILL CALM

01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:24.000
MIND MY ACTUAL SATELLITE

01:03:24.066 --> 01:03:26.536
RETURNS AT SOME SENSE OF NORMAL

01:03:26.602 --> 01:03:28.037
OR IN YOUR NORMAL. BUT ONCE

01:03:28.104 --> 01:03:30.106
THAT HAPPENS TO. BE SUNDAY

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:32.041
MARKETS ARE SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:33.609
COMING NINETEEN WILL NOT BE

01:03:33.676 --> 01:03:35.411

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:46.589
BE CONTINUED OUT ONCE. HE IS NO

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:48.658
LONGER CRISIS SO WHILE WE DON'T

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:49.959
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE TEMPORARY

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:51.694
MEANS THE CRISIS IS SUCH AN

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:54.664
UNUSUAL SITUATION. CERTAINLY

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:56.399

AND- LEGAL LANGUAGE. IN THIS

01:04:16.819 --> 01:04:18.821
BUDGET TO COME. THAT SOUL A

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:20.790
SEARCH THAT AT CERTAIN TRIGGER

01:04:20.856 --> 01:04:24.026
POINTS THAN THAT LORI WILL

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:26.262
REVERT TO THE LEGISLATIVE

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:27.396
BRANCH AT THAT SUPPORT

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:29.865
RECONCILED. SENATOR NIELSEN

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:31.534
BOOK ONE TWO NINE TONIGHT

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:34.070
MISTER HIS HAND RAY PREDATORS

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:38.441
OF LITTLE RISK TO THAT. YES

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:39.976
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:41.477
YOU SENATOR NIELSEN FOR THE

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:46.315
QUESTIONS. I THOUGHT I COULD

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:48.251
ADDRESS BOTH IN THE THAT YOU'VE

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:50.386
HAD SO FAR I WANTED TO JUST

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:52.054
BEGIN WITH THE DIFFERENCE IN

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:53.522
OUR LIVES IN OUR ESTIMATED

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:55.191
BUDGET PROBLEMS OUR DEFICITS

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:56.759
BECAUSE YOU RAISE THAT AND I DO

01:04:56.826 --> 01:04:58.027
THINK I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:04:58.094 --> 01:05:01.264
QUESTION WE- MADE IT. THAT THE

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:02.732
STATE COULD BE FACING A BUDGET

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:06.035
PROBLEM OF EIGHTEEN BILLION TO

01:05:06.102 --> 01:05:07.903
THIRTY TO THIRTY ONE BILLION.

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:09.705
WE CONSIDERED THAT EIGHTEEN

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:11.173
BILLION TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.075
SOMEWHAT MORE OPTIMISTIC

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:15.711
ECONOMIC SCENARIO. AND THE

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:16.679
THIRTY ONE BILLION TO BE

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:19.482
ASSOCIATED WITH A SOMEWHAT MORE

01:05:19.548 --> 01:05:21.384
STICKS AN AREA. THE IMPORTANT

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.352
THING IS I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:26.856
AT THE UNDERNEATH THE THOSE

01:05:26.922 --> 01:05:29.025
SURFACE LEVEL NUMBERS ARE

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:30.059
REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:31.794
FUNDAMENTALLY REFLECTING A

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:34.263
SIMILAR VIEW OF THE WORLD. IN

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:35.398
THE IT'LL SHAKE SCENARIO OR THE

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:38.534
PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO WE SEE A

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:39.235
THIRTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:41.137
REVENUE DECLINE COMPARED WITH%

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:42.872
JANUARY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:05:42.938 --> 01:05:44.674
FINANCE HAS A FORTY ONE BILLION

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.977
DOLLAR DECLINE. SO THAT PART OF

01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:49.912
THE EQUATION IS FAIRLY SIMILAR

01:05:49.979 --> 01:05:51.514
I THINK WHERE WE DIFFER IS IN

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.516
OUR METHODOLOGY FOR MEASURING

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:56.385
THE BASELINE OF EXPENDITURES.

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:58.020
THE GOVERNOR WHEN THE

01:05:58.087 --> 01:06:00.189
GOVERNOR'S NAME A NUMBER

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:00.990
ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEIGHBOR

01:06:01.057 --> 01:06:02.925
VISION CAME OUT THANK WHAT IT

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:05.227
DOES IS INCLUDES THE COST

01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:07.163
ASSOCIATED WITH THE JANUARY

01:06:07.229 --> 01:06:09.799
PROPOSALS. AND IT ALSO TREATS

01:06:09.865 --> 01:06:13.202
THINGS LIKE- INCREASED FEDERAL

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:14.270
MATCHING FUNDS IN A DIFFERENT

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:17.340
WAY WHERE AS WE RECOGNIZE THAT

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:19.041
THE LA- WE RECOGNIZED THE

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:21.310
INFLUX OF SEVERAL MATCHING

01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:23.679
SIGNS AS HELPING CHIU. THE

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:25.581
DEFICIT OR THE BUDGET PROBLEM

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:27.116
THE GOVERNOR DOES YOU BUT

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:29.485
RATHER WORK INCLUDES TEN ON THE

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:31.120
SOLUTION SIDES OF THEIR

01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:32.922
INCREASED FEDERAL DOLLARS WOULD

01:06:32.988 --> 01:06:35.057
HELP US SOLVE THE BUDGET

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:36.692
PROBLEM. WHERE IS SORT OF USE

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:38.794
THAN NOT FRENCH ISSUE THE

01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:42.832
BUDGET- SO SOME OF IT IS REALLY

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:45.568
A MATTER OF. DOES SHE IN THE

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:46.602
PARKING. BUT WE ARE HAVE DE

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.604
CASE LOTUS THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:49.672
FINANCE HAS SUBSTANTIALLY

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:51.707
HIGHER CAL WORKS CASELOAD

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:53.943
ESTIMATES THAN WE DO. AND THEY

01:06:54.009 --> 01:06:54.910
ALSO HAVE WELL THEY HAVE

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:57.513
SIMILAR MEDI CAL CASELOAD

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.248
ESTIMATES THEY HAVE A HIGHER

01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:02.685
PER CASE LOAD IN HOSPITAL FOR

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:05.388
HER AT CASE- ACOSTA THEN WE'D

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:07.056
USE UP. THE KEY DIFFERENCES IN

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:09.692
CASE LAW. ARE OUT ON CAL WORKS

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:11.394
SIDE JUST A HIGHER NUMBER ON

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:14.497
THE MEDICAL SIDE HIGHER COSTS

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:18.634
FOR CASE. WOULD IS TO. THE

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:21.904
FUNDING FOR THE FOR COVERT

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:24.974
RESPONSE. THINK THAT THE CHAIR

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.542
AND USE SENATOR NIELSEN OR

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:28.177
RAISING A VERY IMPORTANT POINT

01:07:28.244 --> 01:07:31.313
WE THINK THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.116
SOME DISCUSSION HERE AND WITH

01:07:34.183 --> 01:07:36.118
REGARD TO THE TWO POINT NINE

01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:37.920
BILLION PROPOSED CONTENT-

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:40.055
COATED NINETEEN CONTINGENCY

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:42.291
FUND. THAT IS BEING PROPOSED

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:44.827
UNDER THE CONTROL SECTION

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.395
THIRTY SIX PROCESS AND YOU KNOW

01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:48.431
WAIT IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE-

01:07:48.497 --> 01:07:49.732
BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:52.201
APPROVED PREVIOUSLY. BUT YOU

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:53.769
KNOW EVEN WITH THAT WE THINK

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:55.304
THAT YOU COULD CONSIDER MAKING

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:57.039
SOME AMENDMENTS YOU COULD

01:07:57.106 --> 01:07:59.975
REQUIRE THAT THE- NOTIFICATION

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:01.944
ALSO INVOLVED LEGISLATIVE

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:04.713
APPROVAL NOT JUST. A SIMPLE

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:07.016
REPLICATION. COULD INCLUDE A

01:08:07.082 --> 01:08:08.417
REQUIREMENT THAT IT'S A LITTLE

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:10.853
BIT MORE SPECIFIC IN WHAT TYPES

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.321
OF CONSERVE ELIGIBLE TO BE

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:14.056
SPENT NOT JUST A BROAD CATCH

01:08:14.123 --> 01:08:15.825
ALL OF IT. EVERYTHING RELATED

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:17.960
TO COPE. I'M YOU COULD ALSO

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:20.329
REQUIRE AN INCREASED LEVEL AND

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:22.364
MORE SPECIFIC OR DETAILED

01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:24.633
INFORMATION DISCLOSURE. THERE

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.869
IN SOME CASES SO FAR WE HAVEN'T

01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:28.971
HAD AS MUCH OF THAT IS WE THINK

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:33.542
WOULD BE. AND SO THESE ARE SOME

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.077
OF THE ITEMS THAT WE THINK YOU

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:36.245
MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AND WE

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:37.947
WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:40.115
AND I THINK YOU KNOW THROUGH

01:08:40.182 --> 01:08:42.618
THIS. SORT OF THOSE. THIS IS.

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.720
IT SECOND RESPECT WELL THAT IS

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.289
IMPORTANT AND IT'S- BEEN GOING

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:49.725
ON A VERY LONG TIME. AND PART

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.293
OF THIS IS GOING TO BE VIEWED

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:54.930
BY THIS NEXT QUESTION HELLO

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:55.531
FROM A FRIEND THAT TO YOU THEN

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:57.900
AT THIS POINT. YOUR PROJECT IN

01:08:57.967 --> 01:09:00.569
IS IF WE PROCEED WITH THIS

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.738
BUDGET OUTLINED. WITH BEFORE US

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:06.408
HERE. IF WE EXTEND UP TO TWENTY

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:07.376
TWENTY THREE I BELIEVE IT IS WE

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:10.379
WOULD END UP STILL WITH SOME

01:09:10.446 --> 01:09:10.980
SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:13.616
RED. IT AND THAT WOULD ARGUE TO

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:15.718
THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT THAT WE

01:09:15.784 --> 01:09:18.120
BUILT IN OVER DECADES. IS THAT

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:23.659
STILL HOW YOU SEE IT. ON THAT

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:25.661
FOR ME STATE INTERNAL CENTERED

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:27.830
ALIKE BUT I'M SORRY. I WASN'T

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:31.901
SPEAKING INTO THE MIKE. THE YOU

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:33.736
PROJECT NOW IN YOUR DEPARTMENT

01:09:33.802 --> 01:09:36.672
A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BY TWENTY

01:09:36.739 --> 01:09:37.673
TWENTY THREE OF ABOUT SIXTEEN

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:42.177
BILLION IF JUST THIS OUTLINE IS

01:09:42.244 --> 01:09:43.779
WHAT WE USE TO GOVERNOR'S AS-

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:46.882
WHAT IN THE BUDGET. THAT WOULD

01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:48.684
SEEM TO ME IT ARGUES TO THE

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:50.386
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT THAT WE WILL

01:09:50.452 --> 01:09:52.354
HAVE NOT CORRECTED EITHER IN

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:54.123
OUR PAST TROUBLES OR IN THE

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:57.526
CURRENT ONE. SO I WOULD LIKE TO

01:09:57.593 --> 01:09:58.494
SEE A BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT

01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:00.829
IN THIS BUDGET THAT STRUCTURAL

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:01.931
PROBLEM GET A SIXTEEN BILLION

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:04.366
IN THE RED. A JUST A FEW YEARS

01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:07.770
OUT THERE TWENTY TWENTY THREE.

01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:10.039
RIGHT I THINK- YES WE AGREE

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:12.708
THAT THERE IS. THERE'S STILL A

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:14.743
STRUCTURAL PROBLEM UNDER THE

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:17.780
NAY REVISION IN THE MULTI YEAR-

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:19.415
FISCAL OUTLOOK AND CIRCLE

01:10:19.481 --> 01:10:22.318
WITHIN A REVISION. AND IT DOES-

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:23.986
CULMINATE IN ABOUT A SIXTEEN

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:25.487
BILLION DOLLAR PROBLEM AT THE

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:28.757
END OF TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR

01:10:28.824 --> 01:10:31.694
AND- YOU KNOW SO I DO THINK

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.862
THAT THIS THIS BUDGET IS-

01:10:33.929 --> 01:10:36.165
RESPONDING IN SOME WAYS TO THE

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:38.534
URGENCY OF THE CRISIS THAT HAS

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:40.202
FALLEN THE STATE. AND IT'S

01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:42.338
UNDERSTANDABLE THAT NOT ALL OF

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:44.673
THEM THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED-

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:48.210
IMMEDIATE WE- BUT THAT IS WHY

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.079
WE RAISE THE POINT THAT PRETTY

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:51.547
MUCH ALL OF THE ONGOING

01:10:51.614 --> 01:10:54.183
SOLUTIONS IN THE PROPOSAL. OUR

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:57.252
FIND THE- EXPENDITURE SIDE AND

01:10:57.319 --> 01:10:59.021
THEY'RE ALL PRETTY MUCH ALL

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:01.724
ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRIGGERS SO

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:03.492
THEY WOULD BE REMOVED YOU KNOW

01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:05.861
THAT I'M- TIONS THAT WE'RE IN

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.529
THE BUDGET WILL BE. TRIGGERED

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:09.999
OFF IF WE CAN INCREASE FEDERAL

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:12.434
AID BUT OF COURSE IF WE DID GET

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:13.969
THE FEDERAL AID IT WOULD ONLY

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:17.773
LIKELY BE A TEMPORARY SOLUTION

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.176
AND SO YOU WOULD HAVE THAT

01:11:21.243 --> 01:11:22.111
PHASING. OUT BUT ALL HAVE SOME

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:24.179
OF THE YOU KNOW THE ADDITIONAL.

01:11:24.246 --> 01:11:27.149
UNDER THAT NOLES SUSPENSION AND

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:28.817
THE LIMITS ON THE TAX CREDIT

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:30.986
PROPOSALS. IN THOSE WOULD PHASE

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:33.656
OUT AT THE END OF TWENTY THREE

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:34.223
TWENTY FOUR AND SO WHEN YOU

01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:35.658
HAVE SEVERAL OF THESE VARIABLES

01:11:35.724 --> 01:11:37.059
COMING TOGETHER AT THE SAME

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.627
TIME. I THINK YOU KNOW IT

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:41.497
CONTRIBUTES TO THAT SIXTEEN

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:44.199
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SO THAT

01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:44.800
THAT IS GOING TO STILL BE. AN

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:46.235
ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:48.270
CONTEND. THAT IN THE NEXT

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:50.739
COUPLE OF YEARS PROBABLY. THANK

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:53.208
YOU IF I MAY THEM BACK TO MR.

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:55.277
MISSION NOT PLEASE. CUT

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:59.782
DIRECTOR OF FINANCE. THIS IS

01:11:59.848 --> 01:12:02.685
KIND OF AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THESE

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:05.988
LONG TERM PLANS CAN GO AWRY.

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:07.556
I'M CONCERNED ALWAYS ABOUT THE

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:10.092
PLIGHT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:10.893
I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE IN

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:13.062
SERIOUS TROUBLE AND ONE OF THE

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:17.132
PROPOSALS HERE IS TO. GIVE THE

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:19.268
REST OF THE JUVENILE AUTHORITY

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:22.705
AND HOUSING AND REHABILITATIVE

01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:23.172
EFFORTS OVER TO LOCAL

01:12:23.238 --> 01:12:26.375
GOVERNMENT. WHICH IS FOR TO

01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:29.378
SAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND-

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:31.480
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS I GUESS.

01:12:31.547 --> 01:12:33.382
BUT LET WITH THE STATE IS GONNA

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:35.684
RECOMPENSE THOSE COUNTIES BY

01:12:35.751 --> 01:12:38.220
ONLY NINE POINT SIX NOW OUR

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:41.190
LAST REALIGNMENT DID DOUBLE LOT

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:43.292
OF RESPONSIBILITIES ON OUR

01:12:43.358 --> 01:12:45.127
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TYPICALLY OUR

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:48.564
LOCAL JAILS. HOW CAN WE KEEP

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.432
GOING DOWN THIS PATH OF

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:51.600
SHIFTING MORE AND MORE TO LOCAL

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:52.701
GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE OUR

01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:56.238
PROBLEMS. AND THEN JUST SAYING

01:12:56.305 --> 01:12:57.906
TO THEM WILL FIGURE IT OUT.

01:12:57.973 --> 01:13:01.076
THAT'S QUITE A DISCREPANCY FROM

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:02.277
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO NINE POINT

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:05.681
SIX DID I READ THOSE WRONG. SO

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:07.483
I WILL MAKE ONE GENERAL POINT

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:09.017
AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO

01:13:09.084 --> 01:13:10.419
MY COLLEAGUE HERE AN ADWORDS

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:11.487
SUCH A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:12.688
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT SPECIFIC

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:14.823
PRO PROPOSAL NUMBERS ASSOCIATED

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:17.259
WITH SEX THE OVERALL IS THAT

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:19.661
WE- DEFINITELY ACKNOWLEDGE AND

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:22.231
UNDERSTAND RECOGNIZED AT LOCAL

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:23.832
GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDER THE SAME

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:27.069
TAXES PRESSURES AT THE STATE.

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:28.871
BUDGET CASES EVEN MORE AND IT'S

01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:30.272
ONE OF THE REASONS I AM WHEN IT

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:31.540
CAME TO THE CRIME HIGHER SO WE

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:32.875
FIND THAT NINE POINT FIVE

01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:34.710
BILLION DOLLARS THEY CAME TO

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:36.879
THE STATE- WE DECIDED THAT EVEN

01:13:36.945 --> 01:13:37.946
THOUGH THE STATE HAD

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:39.414
FLEXIBILITY TO USE THAT FOR A

01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:40.716
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STATE

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:42.417
PURPOSES. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:44.286
IN OUR PROPOSAL IN PATIENTS

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:46.021

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:49.158
WHEN TO LOCAL. INCLUDED ABOUT

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:51.827
ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS.

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:53.495
A COUNTIES AND ENERGY MONEY FOR

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:55.063
HOMELESS AND PUBLIC SAFETY

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:58.066
FUNDING. THROUGH THAT PART OF

01:13:58.133 --> 01:13:59.568
SIMPLY COULD YOU. AND THE

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:02.237
PROPOSAL ON OUR THOUGHT IS THAT

01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:04.206
THE ASSEMBLY SAVINGS GENERATED

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:04.807
CAN HELP OFFSET SOME OF THE

01:14:04.873 --> 01:14:06.275
COSTA LET ME TURN IT OVER TO

01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:08.977
ERIN EDWARDS ELABORATE. THANK

BUDGET YOU'RE IN TERMS OF OUR

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:23.792

OF OUR TRANSITION OUR PLAN A

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:28.897
TRANSITION DJJ LOCALS- THE PLAN

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:30.732
IS TO DO THIS THROUGH ATTRITION

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:32.601
AND SO IT'S NOT AN IMMEDIATE

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:35.404
CHEFS- RESPONSIBILITY OR IN THE

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:35.971

FUNDING IN THE FIRST YEAR IS

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:45.080
JUST THE BEGINNING OF THIS

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:47.416
TRANSITION I DOES NOT REFLECT

01:14:47.482 --> 01:14:50.085
THE FULL AMOUNT OF FUNDING- THE

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:51.687
FULL NOT A FUNNY WILL GROW OVER

01:14:51.753 --> 01:14:53.222
TIME AND THAT WILL DEPEND ON

01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:55.324
THE NUMBER OF. YOU SHOULD HAVE

TO CODES I DO HAVE THREE

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:44.366
QUESTIONS RELATION TO THAT- SO

FIRST OF ALL I'M A START OFF.

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:47.502
WE KNOW THAT BEAU'S FORMAL

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:49.504
POPULATIONS ARE SENIORS- WE

01:16:49.571 --> 01:16:52.574
UNDERSTAND THAT. IS IT IS LIKE

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:54.743
NURSING HOMES ARE PARTICULARLY.

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:56.478
ACCOUNTABLE TO COVET DEBTS THAT

01:16:56.545 --> 01:16:59.047
PARTICULAR FOCUS WE SHOULD HAVE

01:16:59.114 --> 01:16:59.681
AS WELL IN TERMS OF TESTING AND

HELPS KEEP PEOPLE FROM COMING

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:19.735
INTO NURSING HOMES SO I THOUGHT

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:20.669
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE

01:17:20.736 --> 01:17:23.138
OUT. OF IT ALSO HAS A COST BY

01:17:23.205 --> 01:17:23.839
THE WAY THEY END UP IN A

01:17:23.905 --> 01:17:26.942
NURSING HOME- WE'VE ALSO.

NUTRITION. PROGRAMS FOR SENIORS

01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:34.516
AS WELL. THE SEEM TO BE

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:36.985
SOMEWHAT COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. TO

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:38.620
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE-

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:39.254
WHAT'S THE SOME OF THE EFFORTS

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:41.023
THAT WE'RE DOING TO. TRY TO

01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:42.391

THOUGH RIGHT SO I GUESS MY

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:02.544
FIRST QUESTION IS THAT GIVEN

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:03.912
THE FACT THAT WHAT WE DO KNOW

01:18:03.979 --> 01:18:06.348
ABOUT ARE COVERED RESPONSES

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:07.849
THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE

EDUCATION AND OTHER PARTS OF

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:19.968
THE BUDGET NAY REALLY

01:27:20.034 --> 01:27:21.970
PRACTICALLY IS VERY DIFFICULT

01:27:22.036 --> 01:27:22.637
TO SOLVE THE BUDGET DEFICIT

01:27:22.704 --> 01:27:25.006
EXACT SIZE WITHOUT HAVING TO

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:26.407

WE GET THE DEFICIT WE GET THE

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:48.296
AMOUNTS BUT EVEN WITHIN A

01:27:48.363 --> 01:27:50.198
CERTAIN AMOUNT EVEN IF YOU'RE

01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:52.166

THE MONEY WITHIN THOSE

01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:18.426
PARAMETERS OKAY SO WE HAVE THEM

01:28:18.493 --> 01:28:19.694

01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:20.695
ADDRESS THE DEFICIT THAT THE

01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:23.097
JUST ONE FINAL PIECE AGAIN-

01:28:30.104 --> 01:28:31.639
WORK. WITH GETTING. SOMETHING I

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:33.608
DON'T HAVE A COME. WHAT'S

01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:34.976

AGAIN SIMILARLY. BASICALLY

01:28:40.248 --> 01:28:41.983
WE'RE MAKING REDUCTIONS THERE

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:43.951
AT THAT SEEMS TO BE COUNTER

01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:45.486
PRODUCTIVE ACTUALLY IT PROBABLY

01:28:45.553 --> 01:28:47.121

BE INCONSISTENT WITH A CASELOAD

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:58.733

TO BE. MORE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.275
THE WAY WE'RE DOING THE CUTS IN

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:08.509
A WAY THAT REFLECT WHAT THE

01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:10.712
GOALS THAT WE SEE IT HAPPENING

01:29:10.778 --> 01:29:12.046
BECAUSE OF ENDEMIC AND

01:29:12.113 --> 01:29:13.414
RESPONDING APPROPRIATELY TO

FUNDING. SHOW UP. BUT WE ALSO

01:29:20.755 --> 01:29:22.123
TO RECOGNIZE WHAT THE KEY IS

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:24.125
LOADING CREATE. IT IT'S

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.927
CHALLENGING TO SIMPLY SAY WE'RE

01:29:25.993 --> 01:29:27.795
GOING TO CUT THIS PROGRAM WILL

01:29:27.862 --> 01:29:28.362

IN THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH US

01:29:44.912 --> 01:29:47.115
TODAY. THERE'S BEEN REFERENCE

01:29:47.181 --> 01:29:51.552
TO. OUR LAST GREAT RECESSION

01:29:51.619 --> 01:29:55.690
200-082-0009 INTO. TWENTY TEN

01:29:55.757 --> 01:29:56.491
ELEVEN. I CAME INTO THE

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:58.626
ASSEMBLY THAT TIME IN ONE OF

01:29:58.693 --> 01:30:01.329
THE BIG DIFFERENCES WE RAN INTO

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:03.364
A FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR

01:30:03.431 --> 01:30:06.734
DEFICIT. BUT WE COULD TRACE THE

01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:10.171
CAUSES OF THAT TOO MALFEASANCE

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:12.373
IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.242
MALFEASANCE THAT LED TO MANY

01:30:14.308 --> 01:30:16.077
PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:17.545
LOSING JOBS THROUGH

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:19.013
UNEMPLOYMENT BECAUSE BY THAT

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.783
CASCADING. GLOBAL ECONOMIC

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:24.418
CRISIS THIS CRISIS IS A LITTLE

01:30:24.485 --> 01:30:27.855
DIFFERENT. IT'S A PANDEMIC AND

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:29.724
WHILE WE DON'T KNOW THE COURSE

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:32.927
THAT THE PANDEMIC WILL TAKE. WE

01:30:32.994 --> 01:30:33.461
DO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE OF

01:30:33.528 --> 01:30:36.597
KNOWING. WE WERE IN A STRONG

01:30:36.664 --> 01:30:39.200
ECONOMIC POSITION AT THE TIME

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:41.235
OF THE PANDEMIC IN THAT WERE

01:30:41.302 --> 01:30:42.336
ABLE TO USE SOME OF THAT

01:30:42.403 --> 01:30:44.839
STRENGTH AS WE NOW TRY TO

01:30:44.906 --> 01:30:47.008
MANAGE THE CURRENT PROJECTED

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:48.509
SHORTFALLS. THERE'S BEEN

01:30:48.576 --> 01:30:51.145
DIFFERENT ECONOMIC MODELS OF

01:30:51.212 --> 01:30:55.149
HOW WE MIGHT RECOVER THE SPEED

01:30:55.216 --> 01:30:58.619
OF THAT RECOVERY- BUT WE WILL

01:30:58.686 --> 01:31:02.557
RECOVER. STRONG TV IN THE STATE

01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:05.226
OF CALIFORNIA IN NATIONALLY

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:07.061
THAT SAID I THINK OUR BIGGEST

01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:09.063
CHALLENGES THE UNKNOWN OF THE

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:12.066
COURSE OF COVERT NINETEEN. IN

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:15.102
THE DESIRE OF MANY TO RETURN TO

01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:16.938
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND TRYING TO

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:19.140
BALANCE THAT. TO WHAT'S IN THE

01:31:19.207 --> 01:31:20.675
BEST INTEREST OF PROTECTING

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:23.778
PUBLIC HEALTH AND REDUCING THE

01:31:23.845 --> 01:31:27.548
CURVE OF DEATH- FROM. END

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:31.886
ILLNESS FROM COVERT NINETEEN.

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:33.154
ONE OF THE CONCERNS AND I'D

01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:36.123
LIKE TO HEAR FROM BOTH FINANCE

01:31:36.190 --> 01:31:38.826
AND LA- WE'VE HEARD FROM THE

01:31:38.893 --> 01:31:40.595
CITIES THAT WE REPRESENT.

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:42.964
THEY'VE BEEN ON THE- BUT ONE

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:45.066
SERVE PUBLIC SAFETY RESPONSE

01:31:45.132 --> 01:31:49.270
FIRE POLICE OTHER SERVICES

01:31:49.337 --> 01:31:53.574
THEY'VE LOST REVENUE STREAMS TO

01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:55.243
THE CITIES AS I UNDERSTAND THE

01:31:55.309 --> 01:31:57.178
CURRENT. PROPOSED A RE. THE

01:31:57.245 --> 01:31:58.779
GOVERNOR SEEKS CORRECT SOME OF

01:31:58.846 --> 01:32:00.014
THE CARE IS MONEY THAT WE'VE

01:32:00.081 --> 01:32:03.651
ALREADY BEEN ALLOCATED FOUR

01:32:03.718 --> 01:32:04.418
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO THE

01:32:04.485 --> 01:32:07.054
CITIES AND I THINK ONE POINT

01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:08.556
TWO OR ONE POINT THREE BILLION

01:32:08.623 --> 01:32:11.359
TO THE COUNTIES. I'M THERE'S

01:32:11.425 --> 01:32:13.394
CERTAIN FROM CITIES THAT I

01:32:13.461 --> 01:32:14.662
REPRESENT I KNOW THAT OTHERS

01:32:14.729 --> 01:32:18.366
REPRESENT SMALLER SO THE CENTER

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:18.833
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:21.736
POPULATION CITY CENTER FIVE

01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:22.937
HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION.

01:32:23.004 --> 01:32:26.240
AND ACTED SHORTFALLS FOR CITIES

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:30.711
OF UP TO SEVEN BILLION IT SEEMS

01:32:30.778 --> 01:32:31.345
LIKE ONE OF THE UNKNOWN. AS WE

01:32:31.412 --> 01:32:34.081
TRY TO NAY OUT OF THIS CRISIS

01:32:34.148 --> 01:32:37.084
IS QUITE FEDERAL MONEY MAY BE

01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:39.553
AVAILABLE IN THE MAY REVISE HAS

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.756
CRAFTED. A STRUCTURE WITH

01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:44.425
TRIGGERS BASED ON FUTURE

01:32:44.492 --> 01:32:47.061
FEDERAL MONEY. SO I HAVE ONE

01:32:47.128 --> 01:32:48.195
OTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO

01:32:48.262 --> 01:32:50.031
THIS BUT I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:53.234
THOUGHTS ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE

01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:55.336
THE AND ADEQUACY. OF THIS

01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:57.672
DIRECTION OF THERE'S SUPPORT

01:32:57.738 --> 01:32:59.173
FOR OUR CITIES. THERE'S ALSO

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.741
CONCERN OF SOME OF IT BEING

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:02.310
DIRECTED THROUGH COUNTIES TO

01:33:02.376 --> 01:33:05.613
THE CITY'S. WHICH IS GOING TO

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.248
DEPUTISE ARE COUNTIES TO BE

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:10.685
AUDITOR'S IN PASS THROUGH. WHY

01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:12.086
CAN'T SOME OF THIS GO DIRECTLY

01:33:12.153 --> 01:33:14.088
TO CITIES SO THEY CAN PUT IT TO

01:33:14.155 --> 01:33:17.091
USE OR BEST NEEDED SO I'D LIKE

01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:18.492
TO HEAR THE ANSWERS TO THAT I

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:20.828
DO HAVE JUST ONE FOLLOW UP

01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:24.598
QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU

01:33:24.665 --> 01:33:26.567
SENATOR MINING AND THAT'S AN

01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:27.601
ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN ON THE

01:33:27.668 --> 01:33:29.070
GOVERNOR'S MIND IN THE

01:33:29.136 --> 01:33:30.671
ADMINISTRATION FOR THE LAST

01:33:30.738 --> 01:33:32.573
SEVERAL WEEKS AS WELL ALL JUST

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:33.975
NEED. TO BRIEF COMMENTS AND

01:33:34.041 --> 01:33:35.209
THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:39.847
ALL 8% SHELTER. I THINK THE

01:33:39.914 --> 01:33:56.163
FIRST COMMENT IS

01:33:58.899 --> 01:34:00.634
I BELIEVE THAT WAY START

01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:02.069
FIFTEEN COUNTY OR AT FIFTY

01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:04.739
JOHNNY'S YES I WAS SIX CITIES

01:34:04.805 --> 01:34:05.339
AROUND THE CITY AND COUNTY OF

01:34:05.406 --> 01:34:08.009
SAN FRANCISCO. IN A STATE WITH

01:34:08.075 --> 01:34:09.977
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND NEARLY

01:34:10.044 --> 01:34:11.846
FIVE HUNDRED CITIES SO MOST OF

01:34:11.912 --> 01:34:13.180
THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN THE

01:34:13.247 --> 01:34:14.949
STATE DID NOT RECEIVE A DIRECT

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:17.251
ALLOCATION UNDER THAT FUNDING

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:19.120
SO I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT

01:34:19.186 --> 01:34:20.755
THE GOVERNOR HAS TIMES AND

01:34:20.821 --> 01:34:21.789
HOPEFULLY AND I CAN READ

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:22.990
MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:34:23.057 --> 01:34:25.259
WHILE WORKING. WITH MEMBERS OF

01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:27.461
THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION IS

01:34:27.528 --> 01:34:30.865
SAYING THAT IN ANY FURTHER.

01:34:30.931 --> 01:34:31.866
COMMENT DISCUSSED WITH THE

01:34:31.932 --> 01:34:34.935
TRADERS WE'RE HOPING THAT AT

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:35.770
SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:41.475
ACTION COMES NOT ONLY. INCLUDES

01:34:41.542 --> 01:34:43.711
STATE HELLO MANAGE OUR OWN

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:45.413
BUDGET PICTURE BUT ALSO INCLUDE.

LOCAL CHURCH. INCLUDING THOSE

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:50.017
FEWER THAN FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE

01:34:50.084 --> 01:34:52.286
WERE LEFT OUT OF THAT ACTION. I

01:34:52.353 --> 01:34:53.888
THINK THE SECOND POINT IN THIS

01:34:53.954 --> 01:34:55.456
WORLD FROM IT OVER TO KRISTIN

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:58.492
IS THAT- WE CAN'T SIMPLY WAIT I

01:34:58.559 --> 01:35:00.294
SAY WELL WE HOPE THE CONGRESS

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:02.263
DOES MORE OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO

01:35:02.329 --> 01:35:03.798
SCHOOL CONSTRAINTS THAT. ALL OF

01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:05.399
US TOGETHER ARE DEALING WITH AS

01:35:05.466 --> 01:35:07.301
WE ALL WORK OUT. IN THE NEXT

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:10.137
MONTHS AS YOU NINETEEN LOCAL

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:15.309
GOVERNMENTS RATINGS RIGHT NOW

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:15.976
AND NOT. I EVEN THOUGH NINE AND

01:35:16.043 --> 01:35:17.878
HOW BILLION DOLLAR I WAS FOR

01:35:17.945 --> 01:35:20.981
SOMEONE. IT WAS A PRIORITY AT

01:35:21.048 --> 01:35:21.649
FOR THE GOVERNOR IN THE NAY

01:35:21.715 --> 01:35:23.350
REVISION OPPOSING THE USE OF

01:35:23.417 --> 01:35:27.321
THE TIMES SEND PORTIONS OF IT

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:27.955
TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ACTUALLY

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:30.124
DISCUSSED WE KNOW THAT TIME. WE

01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:31.258
THAT THEY'RE FACING FALLING

01:35:31.325 --> 01:35:33.094
REVENUE JUST AS WE ARE AND WE

01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.695
HAVE STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH

01:35:34.762 --> 01:35:36.030
COUNTIES WHEN IT COMES THAT

01:35:36.097 --> 01:35:38.099
PUBLIC SAFETY HEALTH AND SOCIAL

01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:42.870
SERVICES HOMELESSNESS THAT

01:35:42.937 --> 01:35:44.004
CITIES AS WELL. KRISTIN THINGS

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:44.772
TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE NOW

01:35:44.839 --> 01:35:47.007
DESTRUCTION. AND I THINK THAT

01:35:47.074 --> 01:35:50.478
THERE IS A LOT MORE TO DO HERE.

01:35:50.544 --> 01:35:52.379
AND SO CHRIS JOHNSON DEPARTMENT

01:35:52.446 --> 01:35:53.814
OF FINANCE AS MY COLLEAGUE

01:35:53.881 --> 01:35:56.851
NOTED WE DID ALLOCATE A PERSON

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:58.586
AT THE STATE'S NINE POINT FIVE

01:35:58.652 --> 01:36:00.488
BILLION DOLLARS TO LOCAL

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:02.223
GOVERNMENTS. THAT MONEY IS IN

01:36:02.289 --> 01:36:04.692
ADDITION A FIVE POINT EIGHT

01:36:04.758 --> 01:36:05.726
BILLION THAT WENT DIRECTLY TO

01:36:05.793 --> 01:36:09.864
ABOUT 84% OF OUR- AND- COUNTIES

01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:12.766
AND CITIES BASED ON POPULATION

01:36:12.833 --> 01:36:14.535
DIRECTLY FROM THE FEDERAL

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:18.405
GOVERNMENT. SO WHAT. THE POINT

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:20.074
THREE BILLION THAT IS ALEX TO.

01:36:20.141 --> 01:36:22.042
IT IS ALLOCATED BASED ON KIND

01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:25.379
OF TWO MAIN COMPONENTS RELATIVE

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:27.748
TO. THEIR SIZE SO THE FIRST IS

01:36:27.815 --> 01:36:29.783
FOR THOSE CITIES IN COUNTY

01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:31.218
COUNTIES WITH POPULATIONS

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:33.954
BELOW. FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:36:34.021 --> 01:36:34.922
THOUSAND WE ARE OUT EATING

01:36:34.989 --> 01:36:38.492
APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE ONE

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:39.326
POINT THREE BILLION. RANGE FROM

01:36:39.393 --> 01:36:41.228
MY FIFTY THOUSAND FOR BETTER

01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:43.164
SMALLER ANY UP TO ABOUT FIFTY

01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:44.732
MILLION FOR LARGER COUNTIES IN

01:36:44.798 --> 01:36:47.034
THAT AREA- WITH AN AVERAGE OF

01:36:47.101 --> 01:36:50.371
ABOUT FIFTEEN AM MILLIONS. AT

01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:52.940
IN ADDITION WE ARE ALLOCATING

01:36:53.007 --> 01:36:55.543
THE REMAINING 50% ALSO TO THOSE

01:36:55.609 --> 01:36:57.211
COUNTIES THAT RECEIVE SOME OF

01:36:57.278 --> 01:36:59.246
THE DIRECT STIMULUS FUNDING AND

01:36:59.313 --> 01:37:00.814
WE DIVIDED THAT INTO TWO

01:37:00.881 --> 01:37:04.051
PRIMARY GROUPS LINE WHERE 45%

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:05.352
IS. DIVIDED AMONG THE COUNTY

01:37:05.419 --> 01:37:07.321
HAS THAT RECEIVES DRIVE

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:09.290
ALLOCATIONS AND THEN THE

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:11.692
REMAINING 55% IS A DIVIDED

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:15.462
AMONG THE COUNTY IS THAT- ALSO

01:37:15.529 --> 01:37:17.198
RECEIVE DIRECT ALLOCATIONS BUT

01:37:17.264 --> 01:37:18.666
DID NOT HAVE ANY CITY LOCATION

01:37:18.732 --> 01:37:21.869
SUBTRACTED FROM THEIR WORDS.

01:37:21.936 --> 01:37:23.804
I'M IN TERMS OF THIS IS WE ARE

01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:25.673
ALLOCATE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY

01:37:25.739 --> 01:37:26.874
MILLION DOLLARS AND PRIMARILY

01:37:26.941 --> 01:37:29.176
DIRECTED AT PUBLIC SAFETY AND

01:37:29.243 --> 01:37:32.046
HOMELESSNESS. AND IT IS THE WAY

01:37:32.112 --> 01:37:34.215
IT BETWEEN KIND OF- THE SEVEN

01:37:34.281 --> 01:37:37.084
CITIES HAVE POPULATIONS BETWEEN

01:37:37.151 --> 01:37:38.752
THREE HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED

01:37:38.819 --> 01:37:39.587
THOUSAND WITH YOU HEARD TWENTY

01:37:39.653 --> 01:37:40.154
FIVE MILLION GOING TO THOSE

01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:42.590
CITIES. AND THEN- TWO HUNDRED

01:37:42.656 --> 01:37:44.725
AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION GOING

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:45.893
TO THE BALANCE I DON'T WANT

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:51.632
IMPORTANT NOTES AND I CERTAINLY

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:52.132
GIVE HER THE BEST AND WE

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:55.936
EXPERIENCED. CRIME WELL THERE

01:37:56.003 --> 01:37:57.638
RIDLEY PROHIBITED FROM BEING

01:37:57.705 --> 01:38:00.174
ABLE TO BE ALLOCATED TO DEAL

01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:00.908
WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

01:38:00.975 --> 01:38:02.776
REVENUE LOSSES FIRST EXPERIENCE

01:38:02.843 --> 01:38:04.478
OF THE STATE LOCAL LEVEL AND I

01:38:04.545 --> 01:38:06.380
THINK THAT YOU KNOW IS CITIES

01:38:06.447 --> 01:38:08.115
AND COUNTIES ARE FACED WITH

01:38:08.182 --> 01:38:11.218
THE- DROP AND USE YOUR ARE YOUR

01:38:11.285 --> 01:38:14.588
HERE FIGURES AND- RANGERS.

01:38:14.655 --> 01:38:16.991
FORTUNATELY DO YOU HAVE ABILITY

01:38:17.057 --> 01:38:18.292
TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO ADDRESS

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:19.860
THOSE TREMENDOUS DROPS IN

01:38:19.927 --> 01:38:24.898
REVENUE. SEC LA- HAVE ANY

01:38:24.965 --> 01:38:31.038
COMMENT ON THIS. HI IT'S

01:38:31.105 --> 01:38:32.840
SENATOR MINING I NORMALLY WE

01:38:32.906 --> 01:38:34.308
WOULD HAVE AT THIS POINT HAVE

01:38:34.375 --> 01:38:37.044
ANY COMMENT ON THE PARTICULAR-

01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:41.749
ALLOCATIONS THAT THE NEIGHBOR

01:38:41.815 --> 01:38:43.350
VISION IS PROPOSING AS IT JUST

01:38:43.417 --> 01:38:46.287
NINE POINT FIVE BILLION TO THE-

01:38:46.353 --> 01:38:47.154
THIS IS INCLUDING TO THE CAT.

01:38:47.221 --> 01:38:48.255
TO THE CITIES YEAH I WOULD

01:38:48.322 --> 01:38:50.591
AGREE WITH. THIS RECESSION

01:38:50.658 --> 01:38:53.727
DIFFERS FROM OUR MOST RECENT

01:38:53.794 --> 01:38:54.662
RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

01:38:54.728 --> 01:38:57.665
AND NINE. WHICH WAS DRIVEN BY.

01:38:57.731 --> 01:38:59.867
AN ACTUAL CRISIS AND SO THE

01:38:59.933 --> 01:39:01.769
GOOD NEWS IS THAT IN THIS

01:39:01.835 --> 01:39:05.306
CURRENT. SITUATION IT DOES SEEM

01:39:05.372 --> 01:39:07.741
THAT THE BANKING SYSTEM AND

01:39:07.808 --> 01:39:10.044
HOUSEHOLD ON SHEETS IN GENERAL

01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:12.613
ARE SOMEWHAT HEALTHIER. AND

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:15.182
THEY WERE AT THAT TIME WHICH

01:39:15.249 --> 01:39:16.116
COULD PROMOTE PUBLIC SOMEWHAT

01:39:16.183 --> 01:39:19.553
FASTER ECONOMIC RECOVERY.

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:22.423
REALLY WHY CREATED A U. SHAPED.

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:24.258
IN OUR SPRING OUTLOOK SO THAT

01:39:24.325 --> 01:39:26.493
YOU COULD SEE IN THE EVENT THAT

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:28.462
IT DID START TO LOOK LIKE THAT

01:39:28.529 --> 01:39:30.898
TYPE OF A- PERSON WAS OCCURRING

01:39:30.964 --> 01:39:32.399
YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE FISCAL

01:39:32.466 --> 01:39:35.069
IMPLICATIONS OF THAT MIGHT BE.

01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:36.203
BUT OF COURSE AS YOU ALLUDED TO

01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:39.573
I THINK THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:42.109
UNCERTAINTY VERY HIGH LEVEL OF

01:39:42.176 --> 01:39:43.877
UNCERTAINTY. NOT JUST THE REST

01:39:43.944 --> 01:39:45.879
WE HAD. ALSO HAVE PEOPLE'S

01:39:45.946 --> 01:39:47.781
RESPONSE TO THE VIRUS WHEN WILL

01:39:47.848 --> 01:39:49.149
THEY BE COMFORTABLE RESUMING

01:39:49.216 --> 01:39:50.951
THEIR ACTIVITIES AS THEY WERE

01:39:51.018 --> 01:39:52.920
BEFORE AND THEN THIRD JUST KIND

01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:54.888
OF. A THIRD DIMENSION TO THE

01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:56.724
UNCERTAINTY IS JUST THE REGULAR

01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:58.826
FORECAST YOU KNOW THAT ECONOMIC

01:39:58.892 --> 01:40:01.729
DOWNTURN IN THE COURSE OUT OF

01:40:01.795 --> 01:40:03.030
IT SO. I THINK THEN YOU KNOW

01:40:03.097 --> 01:40:04.965
THE POTENTIAL FOR US RECOVERY

01:40:05.032 --> 01:40:07.935
IS VERY PLAUSIBLE AND- I WOULD

01:40:08.001 --> 01:40:10.371
NOT ARGUE WITH ANY OF THE

01:40:10.437 --> 01:40:11.672
POINTS HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT THE

01:40:11.739 --> 01:40:13.507
NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID

01:40:13.574 --> 01:40:14.775
THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE QUITE

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:16.844
HELPFUL FOR. FOR THE STATE'S

01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:19.012

02:03:39.612 --> 02:03:40.446
ABOUT THE DIFFERENT CAUSAL

02:03:40.513 --> 02:03:41.447
THANK YOU THE WORLD THAT WE ARE

02:03:41.514 --> 02:03:44.216
A NOT ALL EVERY COASTAL FROM

02:03:44.283 --> 02:03:50.790
JANUARY HAS TO WHAT'S WRONG.

02:03:50.856 --> 02:03:53.259
AND ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE

02:03:53.325 --> 02:03:55.227
COLD WITH NINETEEN WHERE WE

02:03:55.294 --> 02:03:58.697
KNOW THAT. ONE OF THE MOST

02:03:58.764 --> 02:04:02.034
VULNERABLE- OF GROUPS OF

02:04:02.101 --> 02:04:05.437
CALIFORNIANS ARE OVER SIXTY

02:04:05.504 --> 02:04:07.139
FIVE AND SO IT SEEMED TO ME TO

02:04:07.206 --> 02:04:08.707
FIT IN AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

02:04:08.774 --> 02:04:10.876
FACTORED IN WAS THOSE THAT ARE

02:04:10.943 --> 02:04:13.779
MOST VULNERABLE UNDER NOT ONLY

02:04:13.846 --> 02:04:16.515
GENERALLY BUT- ESPECIALLY IN

02:04:16.582 --> 02:04:18.484
THIS ENVIRONMENT OF COLE BUT

02:04:18.551 --> 02:04:21.654
COLE BUT NINETEEN. AND THE ARE

02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:24.290
EXTENDING THAT TO SUCH A SMALL.

02:04:24.356 --> 02:04:29.161
ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF ON COVERED

02:04:29.228 --> 02:04:31.831
UNINSURED. IT SEEMED TO ME TO

02:04:31.897 --> 02:04:33.299
MAKE THE MOST SENSE THEY'RE THE

02:04:33.365 --> 02:04:35.000
ONES WHO CAN BECOME THE MOST

02:04:35.067 --> 02:04:37.970
VULNERABLE THEY ARE THE MOST

02:04:38.037 --> 02:04:40.306
AND- IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'RE

02:04:40.372 --> 02:04:43.509
FINDING NOW. THAT OF CERTAIN

02:04:43.576 --> 02:04:49.248
GROUPS ETHNICALLY ARE BEING

02:04:49.315 --> 02:04:50.983
IMPACTED FAR MORE. I THINK SOME

02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:52.885
OF THIS COULD PREDICTED THAT.

02:04:52.952 --> 02:04:55.321
OF FAR MORE LATINOS THE STATE.

02:04:55.387 --> 02:04:59.959
OF AFRICAN. AND A AGENT

02:05:00.025 --> 02:05:02.494
ISLANDERS OF THOSE ARE GROUPS

02:05:02.561 --> 02:05:04.330
THAT ARE GETTING IMPACTED EVEN

02:05:04.396 --> 02:05:07.032
MORE SO COULDN'T YOU MAKE THE

02:05:07.099 --> 02:05:10.970
CONNECTION THERE THAT OF. THIS

02:05:11.036 --> 02:05:12.771
MEDI CAL EXPANSION AS AN

02:05:12.838 --> 02:05:14.840
EXAMPLE OF WHAT SHOULD BE

02:05:14.907 --> 02:05:17.009
CONSIDERED IN THE END DECIDED

02:05:17.076 --> 02:05:18.210
THE ROLL BACKS SHOULD HAVE

02:05:18.277 --> 02:05:20.880
INCLUDED- GROUPS LIKE THIS

02:05:20.946 --> 02:05:22.815
VULNERABLE GROUPS THAT ARE YOU

02:05:22.882 --> 02:05:24.884
COULD SEE THE NUMBER OF CASES

02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:26.852
AND THE NUMBER OF DEATHS ARE SO

02:05:26.919 --> 02:05:29.388
HIGH- DISPROPORTIONATELY TO THE

02:05:29.455 --> 02:05:31.657
REST OF THE POPULATION. SO I

02:05:31.724 --> 02:05:35.327
WOULD URGE RECONSIDER OBVIOUSLY

02:05:35.394 --> 02:05:36.762
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE FOR

02:05:36.829 --> 02:05:39.265
MORE INFORMATION TODAY. THAN WE

02:05:39.331 --> 02:05:42.968
DID BACK IN JANUARY. AND IF

02:05:43.035 --> 02:05:45.971
THERE'S ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THEM.

02:05:46.038 --> 02:05:48.874
YES WILL SIMPLY SAY I'LL MAKE

02:05:48.941 --> 02:05:50.542
SURE TO TAKE THAT BACK ON THE

02:05:50.609 --> 02:05:52.611
CALL IN THE IN. AND YOU ARE

02:05:52.678 --> 02:05:55.414
THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS

02:05:55.481 --> 02:05:57.950
AND SO VERY COGNIZANT THAT AND

02:05:58.017 --> 02:05:59.952
DECISIONS THAT WE MAY I CAN

02:06:00.019 --> 02:06:02.288
ALWAYS CAN SAY WILL CHANGE IS

02:06:02.354 --> 02:06:08.327
NOT. A OUR GOAL WHEN I ALLERGY

02:06:08.394 --> 02:06:11.931
I KNOW YOU'RE ASKING. ASKED

02:06:11.997 --> 02:06:14.366
ABOUT ELIGIBILITY SHE FOR THE

02:06:14.433 --> 02:06:17.803
MEDICAL. WAS TO PRESERVE. WHAT

02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:24.443
WE- COLLUDED THE EXTENT. COME

02:06:24.510 --> 02:06:27.546
FROM DOCUMENTS TELLS TO AGE

02:06:27.613 --> 02:06:29.114
TWENTY SIX THAT WAS PASSED IN

02:06:29.181 --> 02:06:32.651
LAST MUCH ACTING SO WE KNOW

02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:35.621
THAT'S NOT UNITS KIND OF. WE

02:06:35.688 --> 02:06:40.225
HAVE AN. ON THE LINE- THE

02:06:40.292 --> 02:06:42.428
SECOND QUESTION IS- WHAT WAS

02:06:42.494 --> 02:06:45.664
THE CRITERIA USED TO DECIDE THE

02:06:45.731 --> 02:06:48.867
LIST OF CUTS. OR THE AREAS OF

OF BUT WHAT DID YOU USE TO

02:06:58.143 --> 02:07:02.181
DECIDE. ITS POTENTIAL CUTS. YES

02:07:02.247 --> 02:07:03.615
SO WHEN IT CAME TO THOSE BASE

02:07:03.682 --> 02:07:06.618
CARDS ARE AND ALL ALMOST ALL OF

02:07:06.685 --> 02:07:07.987
WHICH ARE IN AT FOURTEEN

CAL ELIGIBILITY SCHOOLS ARE.

02:07:20.432 --> 02:07:23.068
MEDI CAL OPTIONAL. WERE REDUCE

02:07:23.135 --> 02:07:24.136

SERVICE DAYS YEAH I JUST ASK

02:07:26.338 --> 02:07:28.807
PROGRAM SO THESE ARE THE COURTS

02:07:28.874 --> 02:07:30.275
IN THE CORE. HUMAN WELFARE

02:07:30.342 --> 02:07:31.643
FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT AND

02:07:31.710 --> 02:07:33.312
NONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS IT'S

02:07:33.379 --> 02:07:35.147
GETTING HOT AND WHEN IT CAME TO

02:07:35.214 --> 02:07:36.815
THOSE CUTS. THERE WERE A COUPLE

02:07:36.882 --> 02:07:41.987
AREAS AND I KNOW THAT. WHERE

02:07:42.054 --> 02:07:43.822
THERE WERE A GEN TALK YOU KNOW

02:07:43.889 --> 02:07:45.858
FIRST. YOU CAN CALIFORNIANS.

02:07:45.924 --> 02:07:49.161
STATE WE A CLASS AND- BASIS

02:07:49.228 --> 02:07:52.564
JURORS HER I. HSN. THEIR RECESS

02:07:52.631 --> 02:07:56.101
CHRISTIAN. FOR THE SERVICE OUR

02:07:56.168 --> 02:07:58.771
AT WORK FOR. WHEN IT CAME TO

02:07:58.837 --> 02:07:59.304
SOME OF THESE ARE PRO AS

02:07:59.371 --> 02:08:01.640
MEDICARE FOUR X. WE ARE THE

02:08:01.707 --> 02:08:03.776
RATES FOR REDUCE IDEA NOT WORKS

02:08:03.842 --> 02:08:07.012
FINE DAY BY. FIFTY SIX AND

02:08:07.079 --> 02:08:08.013
THOSE AND SEND A CHECK GENERAL

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:10.582
MEDI CAL GROSS AND THERE WAS

02:08:10.649 --> 02:08:12.851
ALSO. A METHODOLOGY THAT WE

02:08:12.918 --> 02:08:14.520
WANT TAX IN DECIDING

02:08:14.586 --> 02:08:19.425
DEVELOPMENTAL. SERVICES THAT'S

02:08:19.491 --> 02:08:20.059
SHOULD BE IN IN THE TRIGGER AND

02:08:20.125 --> 02:08:21.693
EITHER CALLING THE LINE. I NEED

02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:23.362
MORE DETAIL ON THAT WE TRY TO

02:08:23.429 --> 02:08:24.430
STAY AN APPROACH THAT WOULD

02:08:24.496 --> 02:08:27.366
MINIMIZE THE HARM KNOWING THAT

02:08:27.433 --> 02:08:28.434
THERE'S NO WAY TO ELIMINATE

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:31.870
MINDS WHO ARE STATIONED. THIS

02:08:31.937 --> 02:08:33.705
WELL AGAIN I THINK THAT IF AT

02:08:33.772 --> 02:08:35.941
THE START. PRIORITY WORK THE

02:08:36.008 --> 02:08:37.743
MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS I

02:08:37.810 --> 02:08:39.044
THINK THE RESULTS COULD HAVE

02:08:39.111 --> 02:08:40.846
BEEN A DIFFERENT AND I THINK

02:08:40.913 --> 02:08:41.380
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

02:08:41.447 --> 02:08:43.549
GOVERNMENT. TO REALLY STAND UP

02:08:43.615 --> 02:08:45.884
AND HOLD UP HIGH THE MOST

02:08:45.951 --> 02:08:49.721
VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR STATE-

02:08:49.788 --> 02:08:52.825
AND JUST A- COUPLE MORE THINGS-

02:08:52.891 --> 02:08:55.260
WE DO HAVE WE STILL IT IN YOUR

02:08:55.327 --> 02:08:57.596
PROPOSED BUDGET WE STILL HAVE

02:08:57.663 --> 02:08:58.931
APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN BILLION

02:08:58.997 --> 02:09:02.067
DOLLARS. IRV IS THAT IS THAT

02:09:02.134 --> 02:09:04.269
CORRECT THAT I READ IT RIGHT.

02:09:04.336 --> 02:09:07.039
SO DEAR ON DEBTS IT UNDER THE

02:09:07.106 --> 02:09:08.507
COURT IN A RAINY DAY FUND WHICH

02:09:08.574 --> 02:09:09.541
IS THE BIGGEST LEVEL OF

02:09:09.608 --> 02:09:11.009
RESEARCH WE ARE AT COMPOSING

02:09:11.076 --> 02:09:12.611
SPENDING SEVEN POINT EIGHT

02:09:12.678 --> 02:09:14.480
BILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET

02:09:14.546 --> 02:09:16.648
YEAR SO AFTER THAT THEY WOULD

02:09:16.715 --> 02:09:18.650
BE AN ADDITIONAL. IRAQI POINT

02:09:18.717 --> 02:09:20.085
FOUR BILLION IN THAT ACCOUNT

02:09:20.152 --> 02:09:21.954
APPROXIMATELY AS WELL AS

02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:23.322
ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY

02:09:23.388 --> 02:09:24.790
MILLION IN THE SAFETY NET

02:09:24.857 --> 02:09:29.228
RESEARCH. OUR ON MULTI YEAR

02:09:29.294 --> 02:09:30.095
FORECAST DOES SHOW. RESEARCH IN

02:09:30.162 --> 02:09:34.333
ITS YEARS. SO WITH SO WHAT'S

02:09:34.399 --> 02:09:37.202
THE WHAT'S THE POINT OF THE

02:09:37.269 --> 02:09:39.238
ELEVEN OR WHATEVER EIGHT ELEVEN

02:09:39.304 --> 02:09:40.706
BILLION DOLLARS IN IN RESERVE

02:09:40.772 --> 02:09:42.975
WILL WORK CUTTING BACK UP

02:09:43.041 --> 02:09:44.743
POTENTIALLY COMING CUTTING BACK

02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:46.612
ESPECIALLY OF CUTTING BACK ON

02:09:46.678 --> 02:09:48.714
SUCH ESSENTIAL SERVICES FOR

02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:50.549
SUCH ESSENTIAL VULNERABLE

02:09:50.616 --> 02:09:53.252
POPULATIONS. YES THAT'S A

02:09:53.318 --> 02:09:54.419
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE

02:09:54.486 --> 02:09:56.321
WE'RE SEEING THESE CUTS IN LIKE

02:09:56.388 --> 02:09:57.823
YOU MENTIONED IN ACROSS THE

02:09:57.890 --> 02:09:59.458
STATE IN COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW

02:09:59.525 --> 02:10:01.326
THE THINKING HERE IS TWO FOLD

02:10:01.393 --> 02:10:03.228
NUMBER ONE. THERE IS A

02:10:03.295 --> 02:10:04.830
CONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITION

02:10:04.897 --> 02:10:07.199
UNDER PROPOSITION TWO ABOUT THE

02:10:07.266 --> 02:10:08.634
AMOUNT OF RESEARCH THAT YOU CAN

02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:10.002
WITHDRAW FROM THE RAINY DAY

02:10:10.068 --> 02:10:12.171
SIGNS IN A GIVEN YEAR. BUT MORE

02:10:12.237 --> 02:10:13.438
THAN THAT I THINK THE SECOND

02:10:13.505 --> 02:10:15.574
POINT WHICH IS NO WE HOPE IS

02:10:15.641 --> 02:10:16.074
NOT THE CASE THAT WE'RE

02:10:16.141 --> 02:10:17.809
PROJECTING TO BE THE CASE IS

02:10:17.876 --> 02:10:19.278
THAT EVEN THOUGH WE ARE ALL

02:10:19.344 --> 02:10:21.280
HOPEFUL THAT THE NINETEEN AND

02:10:21.346 --> 02:10:23.382
THEN MAKE OVER THE NEXT YEAR

02:10:23.448 --> 02:10:25.517
WILL BE RESOLVED. MAXINE AS

02:10:25.584 --> 02:10:27.219
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THE

02:10:27.286 --> 02:10:29.221
ECONOMIC EFFECTS BASS ARE GOING

02:10:29.288 --> 02:10:30.956
TO REVERBERATE IN TERMS OF THIS

02:10:31.023 --> 02:10:33.225
CRISIS PROJECTS FOR SEVERAL

02:10:33.292 --> 02:10:36.228
YEARS EVEN THREE OR FOUR YOU

02:10:36.295 --> 02:10:40.999
DOWN THE ROAD MAY NOT NECESSARY

02:10:41.066 --> 02:10:49.341
I SEE. ALL HERE. YEARS AGO SO

02:10:49.408 --> 02:10:51.276
BUDGET OF THE RESEARCH IN THE

02:10:51.343 --> 02:10:52.377
IN THE SKY YEAR THAT MAKES

02:10:52.444 --> 02:10:53.145
THINGS LITTLE BIT YOU AND THIS

02:10:53.212 --> 02:10:54.446
YEAR BUT IT MAKES THINGS LOT

02:10:54.513 --> 02:10:55.814
HARDER MAY THE COST WORSE THE

02:10:55.881 --> 02:10:58.517
NEXT YEAR IN THE AFTER THAT SO.

02:10:58.584 --> 02:10:59.151
WE WHILE WE ARE SIMPLY IT OUT

02:10:59.218 --> 02:11:00.686
THE BUDGET FOR THE COMING YEAR.

02:11:00.752 --> 02:11:01.753
OKAY AND WE CAN STRUCTURE

02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:02.788
DEFICITS ALRIGHT IN THE YEAR

02:11:02.854 --> 02:11:04.389
AFTER. WE DID WANT TO HAVE

02:11:04.456 --> 02:11:05.657
SOMETHING OF A LONG TERM

02:11:05.724 --> 02:11:06.692
OUTLOOK IN MAKING SURE THAT

02:11:06.758 --> 02:11:08.193
WE'RE MINIMIZING THE DAMAGE

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:10.662
THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO. FACE IN

02:11:10.729 --> 02:11:14.399
THOSE COMING YEARS. ACTIONS FOR

02:11:14.466 --> 02:11:16.935
OUR ECONOMY. YEAH YEAH AND I

02:11:17.002 --> 02:11:17.703
UNDERSTAND I MEAN I UNDERSTAND

02:11:17.769 --> 02:11:20.305
THAT POINT OF VIEW AGAIN. WE'RE

02:11:20.372 --> 02:11:22.908
TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WILL

02:11:22.975 --> 02:11:25.143
NOT HAVE FOOD ON THE TABLE.

02:11:25.210 --> 02:11:26.044
PEOPLE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

02:11:26.111 --> 02:11:28.480
SURVIVE. AND THAT'S THE BALLOTS

02:11:28.547 --> 02:11:29.781
THAT'S THE PART OF THE BUDGET

02:11:29.848 --> 02:11:31.617
THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WITH

02:11:31.683 --> 02:11:33.752
REGARDS TO STILL HAVE ENOUGH OF

02:11:33.819 --> 02:11:37.089
A RESERVE OF THAT SIZE TO BE

02:11:37.155 --> 02:11:38.257
ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE

02:11:38.323 --> 02:11:39.791
WHO WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SURVIVE.

02:11:39.858 --> 02:11:41.393
FRAN DEATHS. AND THAT'S WHAT

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:43.428
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE LAST ONE

02:11:43.495 --> 02:11:46.832
IS IT'S A VERY SPECIFIC- BUT-

02:11:46.898 --> 02:11:47.933
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WERE

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.034
TAKING UP AND TALKING ABOUT

02:11:49.101 --> 02:11:53.338
BEFORE. THE BEFORE THE WHOLE

02:11:53.405 --> 02:11:55.374
BIT. AND THAT IS ABOUT THE

02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:57.075
FUNDING FORMULA FOR SPECIAL

02:11:57.142 --> 02:12:00.612

HIGHEST OF ALL. WITH REGARDS TO

02:12:05.884 --> 02:12:08.287
SPECIAL ED STUDENTS IN THE LA

02:12:08.353 --> 02:12:10.522
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND LA

UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IS

02:12:12.324 --> 02:12:16.695
IMPACTED OF VERY HARSHLY UP BY

02:12:16.762 --> 02:12:18.597

CONTINUES TO BE. UP A

02:12:23.702 --> 02:12:25.504
DISPROPORTIONATE OF FINANCIAL

02:12:25.570 --> 02:12:26.705
RISK DISABILITY ON THE SCHOOL

02:12:26.772 --> 02:12:28.540
DISTRICT ESPECIALLY AT A TIME

02:12:28.607 --> 02:12:29.708

INTO THIS BUDGET. IT'S NEVER

02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:04.543
EASY TO MAKE BUDGET CUTS ON THE

02:13:04.609 --> 02:13:06.878
TO SAY THAT AND- OR IN A TOUGH

02:13:06.945 --> 02:13:08.413
FISCAL ENVIRONMENT NOW HAVING

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:10.949
SAID THAT I DO WANNA SECOND. A

02:13:11.016 --> 02:13:12.184
COUPLE OF COMMENTS THAT HAVE

02:13:12.250 --> 02:13:14.419
BEEN MADE BY OTHER COMMITTEE

02:13:14.486 --> 02:13:17.689
MEMBERS IN REGARDS TO THE-

02:13:17.756 --> 02:13:18.957
PRESSURE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:13:19.024 --> 02:13:21.793
AND IN PARTICULAR THE

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:23.128
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THE

02:13:23.195 --> 02:13:24.629
SMALLER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

02:13:24.696 --> 02:13:25.831
NOT GETTING A DIRECT GRANT

02:13:25.897 --> 02:13:28.133
UNDER THE CARES PROGRAM AS WELL

02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:29.568
AS A SMALL RURAL HOSPITALS I

02:13:29.634 --> 02:13:32.437
HAVE A- AND NUMBER EIGHT IN MY-

02:13:32.504 --> 02:13:35.841
DISTRICT THAT MAY NOT. CONTINUE

02:13:35.907 --> 02:13:36.942
TO EXIST THIS. BECAUSE AND IT

02:13:37.008 --> 02:13:38.210
WOULD BE A SHAME FOR US TO LOSE

02:13:38.276 --> 02:13:39.911
THOSE HOSPITALS- THEY'VE DONE

02:13:39.978 --> 02:13:41.480
ALL THE RIGHT THINGS BY

02:13:41.546 --> 02:13:43.248
PREPARING FOR THE SEARCH THAT

02:13:43.315 --> 02:13:45.217
DIDN'T COME THANK GOODNESS WE

02:13:45.283 --> 02:13:47.352
DID THE RIGHT THING. BUT BUT

02:13:47.419 --> 02:13:49.688
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN DOING THEIR

02:13:49.755 --> 02:13:52.057
LIFE BLOODS WORK WHICH IS THE

02:13:52.124 --> 02:13:53.492
ELECTIVE SURGERY SO I JUST WANT

02:13:53.558 --> 02:13:54.793
TO PUT THAT IS A PEN BECAUSE I

02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:56.194
THINK WE'RE- WE'RE PROBABLY

02:13:56.261 --> 02:13:57.195
GONNA HAVE TO COME BACK TO THAT

02:13:57.262 --> 02:13:58.463
AT SOME SOME POINT AND HAVE A

02:13:58.530 --> 02:14:01.767
DISCUSSION. BUT IN REGARDS TO

02:14:01.833 --> 02:14:04.236
I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT- WHAT

02:14:04.302 --> 02:14:05.237
WE'RE DOING WITH HOUSING AND

02:14:05.303 --> 02:14:07.005
HOMELESSNESS AND PART OF THE

02:14:07.072 --> 02:14:08.673
REASON MAY BE THAT WE'RE JUST

02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:09.441
NOT HEARING BACK FROM OUR

02:14:09.508 --> 02:14:12.177
LOCAL- REP. IT IS ABOUT WHAT

02:14:12.244 --> 02:14:13.345
THEY'RE DOING WITH THE

02:14:13.412 --> 02:14:14.679
RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN

02:14:14.746 --> 02:14:17.282
GRANTED TO THEM AND ON MANY OF

02:14:17.349 --> 02:14:19.484
US LOOK AROUND AND AS MUCH AS

02:14:19.551 --> 02:14:21.586
WERE NOT OUT WE STILL WHEN WE

02:14:21.653 --> 02:14:23.588
WHEN WE DO TRAVEL WE SEE THIS.

02:14:23.655 --> 02:14:25.524
NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE ON

02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:27.592
THE STREET AND SO. I'M

02:14:27.659 --> 02:14:30.028
WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK A

02:14:30.095 --> 02:14:30.896
LITTLE BIT ABOUT. HOW YOU

02:14:30.962 --> 02:14:31.530
BELIEVE PROPOSED BUDGET WILL

02:14:31.596 --> 02:14:33.698
HELP THE STATE TO CONTINUE OUR

02:14:33.765 --> 02:14:35.634
EFFORTS TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS

02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:37.469
AND IN PARTICULAR. HOW THE

02:14:37.536 --> 02:14:39.438
BUDGET PLANS TO PRESERVE THE

02:14:39.504 --> 02:14:41.306
GAINS MADE OVER THE PAST COUPLE

02:14:41.373 --> 02:14:42.841
OF YEARS IN THE KEEP IN THE

02:14:42.908 --> 02:14:44.309
HOUSE PROGRAM. HOW DOES IT WORK

02:14:44.376 --> 02:14:50.949
TOGETHER. YES ON THE ISSUE OF

02:14:51.016 --> 02:14:54.119
HOMELESSNESS- WHICH ARE AS THE

02:14:54.186 --> 02:14:55.353
GOVERNOR AND I STAYED IN A

02:14:55.420 --> 02:14:57.956
STATE OF THE STATE OURS IS THE

02:14:58.023 --> 02:14:59.958
TOP PRIORITY FOR THE STATE. IN

02:15:00.025 --> 02:15:01.126
WHICH YOU TALKED ABOUT IN THE

THAT HAS A LITTLE BIT LONGER

02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:29.861
FLEXIBILITY AND THAT'S THE

02:20:32.624 --> 02:20:33.491
THAT'S THE IN. OF THE ADMIN. IS

02:20:33.558 --> 02:20:35.260
TO BUILD UPON. THE A LOT OF

02:20:35.326 --> 02:20:37.328
THAT WORK ON THIS THAT THE

02:20:37.395 --> 02:20:38.396

SO MOVING ON TO A DIFFERENT

02:20:58.616 --> 02:21:01.452
TOPIC AND THIS ONE IS THE- THE

02:21:01.519 --> 02:21:02.353

HOW THEY'LL BE INNOVATIVE AND-

02:21:18.837 --> 02:21:21.906
BE ABLE TO MOVE THE AGENDA

02:21:21.973 --> 02:21:23.107

THEM. THE HORIZON OF THINGS

02:21:56.941 --> 02:22:00.378
THAT COULD BE. THE BATTLE FOR

02:22:00.445 --> 02:22:00.879

02:30:36.026 --> 02:30:38.129
CENTURY- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS

02:30:38.195 --> 02:30:41.499
THAT JUST A DESCRIPTOR OR ARE

02:30:41.565 --> 02:30:43.200
YOU ANTICIPATING A SHORT. CLIP

02:30:43.267 --> 02:30:46.904
IN THE ECONOMY OR- JUST CURIOUS

02:30:46.971 --> 02:30:48.038
IN A COUPLE WORDS WHAT THAT

02:30:48.105 --> 02:30:50.040
MEANT SURE JUST TO KEEP IT

02:30:50.107 --> 02:30:52.109
BRIEF FIVE DEFINITELY NOT

02:30:52.176 --> 02:30:53.444
TREATING THIS AS A BLACK AND I

02:30:53.511 --> 02:30:54.478
THINK WHAT'S AROUND YOU

02:30:54.545 --> 02:30:56.313
PROJECTIONS NOT ONLY THE FIFTY

02:30:56.380 --> 02:30:58.215
FOUR BILLION DOLLAR GAP FOR

02:30:58.282 --> 02:30:59.583
THIS EVENING BUDGET BANKS THE

02:30:59.650 --> 02:31:01.318
STRUCTURAL ABSENT WE NEED. IN

02:31:01.385 --> 02:31:03.521
THE COMING YEARS THIS IS AN

02:31:03.587 --> 02:31:05.723
ECONOMIC CRISIS I THINK WHEN I

02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:09.326
REFER TO ONCE IN A CENTURY TO

02:31:09.393 --> 02:31:11.228
IN TWO WAYS ANY NUMBER ONE. THE

02:31:11.295 --> 02:31:14.632
FACT THAT THIS IS. BY I KNOW

02:31:14.698 --> 02:31:15.766
WHAT IT'S PEOPLE MAY THE

02:31:15.833 --> 02:31:19.136
ANALOGY. NINETEEN EIGHTEEN IN

02:31:19.203 --> 02:31:19.870
THE EARLY PART OF THE TWENTY

02:31:19.937 --> 02:31:21.372
CENTURY THAT WAS EXACTLY THE

02:31:21.439 --> 02:31:23.607
SAME AGO AND THE SECOND THING I

02:31:23.674 --> 02:31:25.109
THINK IS DOUBLE SEE HOW THE

02:31:25.176 --> 02:31:27.912
ROAD TO RECOVERY IS BUT THESE

02:31:27.978 --> 02:31:29.146
LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE NOT

02:31:29.213 --> 02:31:30.915
BEEN SEEN WELL OVER HALF A

02:31:30.981 --> 02:31:32.950
CENTURY YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO

02:31:33.017 --> 02:31:34.618
THE TIME OF THE GREAT QUESTION

02:31:34.685 --> 02:31:35.886
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE GREAT

02:31:35.953 --> 02:31:37.555
RECESSION TEN YEARS AGO WITH

02:31:37.621 --> 02:31:41.525
JUST. AS MANY OF YOU MENTIONED

02:31:41.592 --> 02:31:43.961
YOU WERE. YOUR RESEARCH OTHER

02:31:44.028 --> 02:31:45.396
ELECTED OFFICIAL. THAT WAS A-

02:31:45.463 --> 02:31:47.998
ECONOMIC. AND EVEN. WE SAW.

02:31:48.065 --> 02:31:50.568
LEVELS HE HAD A LITTLE BIT OVER.

02:31:50.634 --> 02:31:52.703
PERCENT IN THIS FIRST.

02:31:52.770 --> 02:31:53.437
WORSENING UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS

02:31:53.504 --> 02:31:54.438
THAT WILL EXCEED AYE AYE

02:31:54.505 --> 02:31:57.208
SEVERAL. SO WE HAVE BEEN

02:31:57.274 --> 02:31:59.376
WATCHING THE ECONOMY OVER THE

02:31:59.443 --> 02:32:01.812
LAST FEW YEARS IMPROVE AND SO

02:32:01.879 --> 02:32:03.080
WE'VE BEEN ABLE THROUGH OUR

02:32:03.147 --> 02:32:04.949
PROP NINETY EIGHT TO GIVE MORE

02:32:05.015 --> 02:32:06.984
MONEY TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:32:07.051 --> 02:32:09.086
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE CAL

02:32:09.153 --> 02:32:11.822
STIRS CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE BEEN

02:32:11.889 --> 02:32:13.991
RISING SO THEY REALLY. AT THE

02:32:14.058 --> 02:32:14.692
END OF THE DAY THEIR DELTA

02:32:14.758 --> 02:32:17.761
RATHER. THIS ONE OF THE BIGGEST.

02:32:17.828 --> 02:32:21.966
ECONOMIC RECESSIONS DEPRESSIONS

02:32:22.032 --> 02:32:24.068
IN IN A CENTURY IS IN THIS TIME

02:32:24.134 --> 02:32:26.237
TO DO SOME. IMPROVEMENTS TO

02:32:26.303 --> 02:32:29.340
SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS AT THE STATE

02:32:29.406 --> 02:32:31.108
LIKE THE PENSION PLANS. COULD

02:32:31.175 --> 02:32:34.111
WE DO A BIKE A DIFF ASSURED

02:32:34.178 --> 02:32:34.812
RISK PLAN AT THE STATE OF

02:32:34.879 --> 02:32:37.047
WISCONSIN. HAS IMPLEMENTED AND

02:32:37.114 --> 02:32:38.983
THEY ALWAYS SHOW UP AS BEING A

02:32:39.049 --> 02:32:40.317
100% FUNDED AT LEAST

02:32:40.384 --> 02:32:41.952
HISTORICALLY FOR THE LAST FEW

02:32:42.019 --> 02:32:43.454
YEARS WHEN THE PEW REPORT COMES

02:32:43.521 --> 02:32:44.855
OUT EVERY YEAR IS THIS AN

02:32:44.922 --> 02:32:46.924
OPPORTUNITY NOW TO SAY HEY.

02:32:46.991 --> 02:32:49.527
LET'S AVOID FURTHER PROBLEMS

02:32:49.593 --> 02:32:51.228
BECAUSE A YEAR OR TWO OR THREE

02:32:51.295 --> 02:32:52.363
OR FOUR FROM NOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:32:52.429 --> 02:32:54.298
HAVE A MUCH LARGER PENSION PLAN

02:32:54.365 --> 02:32:56.667
CONTRIBUTIONS HOW DO WE- WHEN

02:32:56.734 --> 02:32:58.936
WE ARE DOING. NOW WHAT KIND OF

02:32:59.003 --> 02:33:04.074
COVERAGE IN IN. TWENTY TWELVE.

02:33:04.141 --> 02:33:04.875
SAID THE BUDGET AND THE NEW

02:33:04.942 --> 02:33:06.710
REVISION AT AND DID NOT INCLUDE

02:33:06.777 --> 02:33:08.312
ANY OF THIS SPECIFIC TYPES OF

02:33:08.379 --> 02:33:10.581
CHANGES. THAT YOU MENTION. THAT

02:33:10.648 --> 02:33:13.951
BEING SAID WE ARE AWARE OF THE-

02:33:14.018 --> 02:33:16.687
PRESSURES THAT. UNDER AND NOT

02:33:16.754 --> 02:33:17.421
JUST THE STATE BUT SCHOOL

02:33:17.488 --> 02:33:18.455
DISTRICTS ARE WHEN IT COMES TO

02:33:18.522 --> 02:33:20.591
SOME OF THESE RISING COSTS AND

02:33:20.658 --> 02:33:22.192
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY.

02:33:22.259 --> 02:33:23.894
FOR SCHOOLS WE NOT ONLY

02:33:23.961 --> 02:33:25.763
ALLOCATED FOR BILLION DOLLARS

02:33:25.829 --> 02:33:27.398
IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR K.

02:33:27.464 --> 02:33:28.232
TWELVE SCHOOLS FOR THE UPCOMING

02:33:28.299 --> 02:33:31.402
YEAR. ALSO INCLUDED AND

02:33:31.468 --> 02:33:32.436
REALLOCATING SUPPLEMENTARY

02:33:32.503 --> 02:33:34.204
MONEY THAT THE GOVERNOR.

02:33:34.271 --> 02:33:35.139
WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE

02:33:35.205 --> 02:33:38.075
HAS TAKEN OUT OF THE SURPLUS

02:33:38.142 --> 02:33:40.711
LAST YEAR. HE'S THAT BY. SOME

02:33:40.778 --> 02:33:42.379
OF THE SCHOOLS IN CONTRIBUTION.

02:33:42.446 --> 02:33:43.914
IN THE NEXT YEAR AND THE YEAR

02:33:43.981 --> 02:33:45.983
AFTER THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT.

02:33:46.050 --> 02:33:49.019
THIS IS AN ISSUE THESE COSTS

02:33:49.086 --> 02:33:49.553
THAT HIGH SCHOOLS WILL BE

02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:50.721
DEALING WITH FOR SOME TIME TO

02:33:50.788 --> 02:33:54.058
COME AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:33:54.124 --> 02:33:54.658
THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES.

02:33:54.725 --> 02:33:57.328
CAN WE- NEGOTIATE AND MODIFY

02:33:57.394 --> 02:34:01.131
RETIREE MEDICAL PLANS. SO I

02:34:01.198 --> 02:34:01.932
THINK ALL I CAN SAY RIGHT NOW

02:34:01.999 --> 02:34:03.934
IS THAT THOSE CONSIDERATIONS

02:34:04.001 --> 02:34:05.703
ARE NOT DIRECTLY PART OF THE

02:34:05.769 --> 02:34:07.237
GOVERNOR'S. RACE HIGH SPEED

02:34:07.304 --> 02:34:12.076
RAIL. SO WHEN IT COMES TO HIGH

02:34:12.142 --> 02:34:13.844
SPEED RAIL AT THE GOVERNOR I

02:34:13.911 --> 02:34:15.613
HAD SENT OUT HIS PLANS

02:34:15.679 --> 02:34:17.147
RECOGNIZING SOME THE ISSUES

02:34:17.214 --> 02:34:19.016
WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AT THE

02:34:19.083 --> 02:34:20.618
BEGINNING OF HIS ADMINISTRATION

02:34:20.684 --> 02:34:23.287
LAST YEAR. THAT FUNDING FOR

02:34:23.354 --> 02:34:24.555
HIGH SPEED RAIL COMES FROM A

02:34:24.622 --> 02:34:25.789
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SORTS CITY

OUR CLIMATE COSTS WE KNOW WERE

02:38:57.494 --> 02:38:59.062
ARE BIGGER THAN JUST WILD FIRE

02:38:59.129 --> 02:39:00.831

AT THE SAME TIME SO I'M JUST

02:39:18.415 --> 02:39:19.149
CURIOUS TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS

02:39:19.216 --> 02:39:20.984
FIRST ON SORT OF RESPONSE

02:39:21.051 --> 02:39:23.320
CAPABILITIES AND THEN.

02:39:23.387 --> 02:39:24.288
COROLLARY QUESTION ON OUR

02:39:24.354 --> 02:39:26.390
ABILITY TO PREVENT KIND OF

02:39:26.456 --> 02:39:30.394
DISASTERS- BUT ON THE RESPONSE

02:39:30.460 --> 02:39:33.163
I. AT I THINK. SO ESTIMATE OVER

02:39:33.230 --> 02:39:35.198
THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE HAD I

02:39:35.265 --> 02:39:37.467
DON'T KNOW WHERE FIVE JUST SIX

02:39:37.534 --> 02:39:39.970
BILLION DOLLAR COSTS EMERGE

02:39:40.037 --> 02:39:40.971
WHEN WE HAVE MASSIVE

02:39:41.038 --> 02:39:43.240
CATASTROPHIC FIRES SO HOW DO WE

02:39:43.307 --> 02:39:45.842
GET THROUGH- THAT KIND OF

02:39:45.909 --> 02:39:47.311
SCENARIO THIS YEAR UNDER THE

02:39:47.377 --> 02:39:50.714
CURRENT BUDGET. YES SO WHEN IT

02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:52.649
COMES TO THAT ISSUE AND I THINK

02:39:52.716 --> 02:39:54.451
IT'S EXACTLY YOU MENTIONED I

02:39:54.518 --> 02:39:56.053
THINK WHAT WOULD REALLY BE A

02:39:56.119 --> 02:39:58.021
DIFFICULT SCENARIO AS DIFFICULT

02:39:58.088 --> 02:39:59.256
AS A STEREO IS NOT WORKING

02:39:59.323 --> 02:40:01.858
RIGHT NOW. IS IF THIS CRISIS WE

02:40:01.925 --> 02:40:03.360
WERE WE ARE IN WERE COMPOUNDED

02:40:03.427 --> 02:40:05.295
BY SOME OTHER TYPE OF DISASTER

02:40:05.362 --> 02:40:07.431
WHETHER IT'S ANOTHER WILDFIRE

02:40:07.497 --> 02:40:09.933
WHETHER IT'S AN EARTHQUAKE OR

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:11.935
ANY OTHER. SO I KNOW WE WERE

02:40:12.002 --> 02:40:14.004
TALKING BEFORE ABOUT HOW MOST

02:40:14.071 --> 02:40:16.006
OF THE- CREATE A NEW

02:40:16.073 --> 02:40:17.274
INVESTMENTS OF THE GOVERNOR

PROPOSED IN JANUARY. I HAVEN'T

02:40:18.875 --> 02:40:20.344
REALLY WHAT'S WRONG I THINK

02:40:20.410 --> 02:40:21.979
THIS IS ONE OF THESE AREAS

02:40:22.045 --> 02:40:23.981
WHERE WHEN IT COMES TO. FIRE

02:40:24.047 --> 02:40:25.949
FIRE FIREFIGHTERS STAFFING WHEN

02:40:26.016 --> 02:40:27.417
IT COMES TO RESOURCES FOR CAL-

02:40:27.484 --> 02:40:29.286
YES RESPOND TO THE RANGE OF

02:40:29.353 --> 02:40:32.723
DISASTERS AND WHEN IT COMES TO.

02:40:32.789 --> 02:40:34.658
THE ACT UNITY TOWER. THIS IS

02:40:34.725 --> 02:40:36.693
THE DEAL WITH SOME OF THE SHOTS

02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:38.895
THAT WERE SO DESTRUCTIVE. LAST

02:40:38.962 --> 02:40:40.197
YEAR IN MAKING SURE THAT THE

02:40:40.263 --> 02:40:41.365
STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

02:40:41.431 --> 02:40:43.333
I'M RESOURCES THERE WE ARE

02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:44.935
CONTINUING TO MAKE INVESTMENTS

02:40:45.002 --> 02:40:46.236
IN THESE AREAS TO MAKE SURE

02:40:46.303 --> 02:40:49.973
THAT WE ARE WELL EQUIPPED FOR

02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:50.874
WHATEVER. I DO APPRECIATE THAT

02:40:50.941 --> 02:40:52.342
I KNOW. I MEAN I MISSED IT

02:40:52.409 --> 02:40:54.211
YOU'RE ALSO RELYING ON SOME

02:40:54.277 --> 02:40:56.713
KIND OF. CONTINGENCY GIVEN THAT

02:40:56.780 --> 02:40:58.782
EVEN FROM WHAT YOU'VE BUDGET

02:41:00.784 --> 02:41:02.319
AUGMENTING DESPITE ALL THE

02:41:02.386 --> 02:41:04.755
OTHER CUTS. THE COST WOULD

02:41:04.821 --> 02:41:10.327
STILL- ARE. FAR EXCEEDED. SO

02:41:10.394 --> 02:41:10.894
WHAT YOU NEED AND BUDGET FOR

02:41:10.961 --> 02:41:12.562

FEDERAL. AID TO COMMENT AS WELL

02:41:20.137 --> 02:41:22.072
IF WE HAD A STATE MASSIVE

02:41:22.139 --> 02:41:24.274
EARTHQUAKE OR WILD FIRE OR-

02:41:24.341 --> 02:41:29.012

CALVERT ANOTHER COLLEAGUES.

02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:38.488
CALIFORNIA THE STATE NEEDS TO

02:41:38.555 --> 02:41:39.790
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MOUNT THE

02:41:39.856 --> 02:41:42.325
IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND THEN THE

02:41:42.392 --> 02:41:43.560
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HELPS WHAT

02:41:43.627 --> 02:41:44.928
HAPPENED NEXT YEAR MINUS SO

02:41:44.995 --> 02:41:49.132
SEATED AGENCIES AT. ALL LEVELS.

02:41:49.199 --> 02:41:51.435
IT WILL ROLL AND- TO SEE FOR A

02:41:51.501 --> 02:41:53.303
LOT OF THESE EXPLAINS EVEN WHEN

02:41:53.370 --> 02:41:54.171
WE ALSO REALLY RECEIVE

02:41:54.237 --> 02:41:55.972
REIMBURSEMENT OF THE STATE

ALL OF THEM AND REIMBURSEMENT

02:41:59.976 --> 02:42:02.245
CAN TAKE MONTHS IF NOT YEARS SO

02:42:02.312 --> 02:42:04.481
THAT BECOMES MORE CASH FLOW

02:42:04.548 --> 02:42:05.148
MANAGEMENT PROBLEM AND WE

02:42:05.215 --> 02:42:06.616
CERTAINLY HAVE THE CAPABILITY

02:42:06.683 --> 02:42:08.185
TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW. BUT IT'S

02:42:08.251 --> 02:42:10.287
HARD TO ESTIMATE IN ADVANCE

02:42:10.353 --> 02:42:11.988
JUST HOW MUCH THE COST WILL BE

02:42:12.055 --> 02:42:13.957
BECAUSE THAT DEPENDS BOTH ON

02:42:14.024 --> 02:42:16.026
THE SCALE OF THE DISASTER WHAT

VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WILL BE

02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:33.336
CONSIDERED AS PART OF AN

02:43:33.403 --> 02:43:35.906
OVERALL INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN I

02:43:35.972 --> 02:43:38.041
THINK IT WAS ALSO MENTIONED IN

02:43:38.108 --> 02:43:39.776
THE IN THE CUTS TO. OF FUNDING

02:43:39.843 --> 02:43:41.444
FOR THIS IS DANIEL GROUND WATER

ALL THE FARMERS WERE PROBABLY.

02:43:45.682 --> 02:43:47.250
GOING TO BE ON THE BRINK- WITH

02:43:47.317 --> 02:43:50.487
THIS DROUGHT- SO CAN CAN YOU

02:43:50.554 --> 02:43:52.055
JUST LAY OUT WHERE WHERE DOES

02:43:52.122 --> 02:43:53.757
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN LIVE

02:43:53.823 --> 02:43:55.792
IN AND WHAT WEIGHT WHAT MIGHT

02:43:55.859 --> 02:43:57.494
WE SEE IS THAT POTENTIAL

02:43:57.561 --> 02:43:59.362
MECHANISMS FOR. IF ACTUATING

02:43:59.429 --> 02:44:02.599
SAID THE PLAN AND THEN THE

02:44:02.666 --> 02:44:03.767
COMING WEEKS. YES I THINK WHEN

02:44:03.833 --> 02:44:05.268
IT COMES TO THOSE ISSUES AND

02:44:05.335 --> 02:44:06.937
THE MOST DIRECT ANSWER IS THIS

02:44:07.003 --> 02:44:08.038
IS SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNOR

02:44:08.104 --> 02:44:09.773
AND THE ADMINISTRATION YOU WANT

02:44:09.839 --> 02:44:11.474
TO DO AND ARE THINKING ABOUT

02:44:11.541 --> 02:44:13.577
FINDING WAYS TO DO. THAT HAVE

02:44:13.643 --> 02:44:14.878
ENGINE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU

02:44:14.945 --> 02:44:16.646
SETTLED ON THE PAST MECHANISM

02:44:16.713 --> 02:44:18.415
TO DO THAT YEAH WE KNOW. AS

02:44:18.481 --> 02:44:19.616
ALWAYS KNOW WHAT THE BUDGET IS

02:44:19.683 --> 02:44:21.851
UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ME

02:44:21.918 --> 02:44:23.453
TO PROPOSE A BALANCED BUDGET.

02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:24.788
AS YOU MENTIONED SENATOR

02:44:24.854 --> 02:44:26.690
STIRRING THAT THESE LONGER TERM

02:44:26.756 --> 02:44:28.425
PRIORITIES. REBUILDING OUR

02:44:28.491 --> 02:44:29.626
INFRASTRUCTURE CLIMATE

02:44:29.693 --> 02:44:31.461
RESILIENCE AN ADAPTATION ARE

02:44:31.528 --> 02:44:33.129
ALSO VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE

02:44:33.196 --> 02:44:34.931
STATE'S FUTURE AND SO. THE

02:44:34.998 --> 02:44:36.399
REASON THAT SOME OF THOSE WERE

02:44:36.466 --> 02:44:37.467
NOT INCLUDED IN THE NEIGHBOR

02:44:37.534 --> 02:44:39.402
ASIAN IS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T SEE

02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:41.605
A WAY SELECT TOP AND GIVEN

02:44:41.671 --> 02:44:43.106
CURRENT BUDGET REALITIES. BUT

02:44:43.173 --> 02:44:45.609
THE GOVERNOR HAS ALSO MENTIONS

02:44:45.675 --> 02:44:46.610
THAT CONNECTS YOU TO LOOK AT

ENROLL IN MEDICARE LITERACY

02:49:01.331 --> 02:49:03.733
COATED TESTING INCOME WOULD

REALLY TREAT. FROM THE

02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:09.973
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS- HAD

02:49:10.039 --> 02:49:12.008
SOME ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

02:49:12.075 --> 02:49:13.676
I HOPE THAT THEY CAN BE

02:49:13.743 --> 02:49:17.347
DISCUSSED IN SUBCOMMITTEE. THE

02:49:17.413 --> 02:49:19.516
S. SIMILARLY I THINK THERE ARE

02:49:19.582 --> 02:49:21.784
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING

02:49:21.851 --> 02:49:22.352
CAL FRESH WHERE CAN PROGRAMS

02:49:22.418 --> 02:49:25.255
LIKE THAT ADDITIONALLY ON THE

02:49:25.321 --> 02:49:28.024
ECONOMIC FRONT. THE BUDGET

02:49:28.091 --> 02:49:30.360
INCLUDES- I BELIEVE SO AN

02:49:30.426 --> 02:49:32.161
INCREASE IN THE LOAN GUARANTEE

02:49:32.228 --> 02:49:36.766
FORCE OUR SMALL BUSINESSES

02:49:36.833 --> 02:49:37.901
WHICH OBVIOUSLY WILL GET

02:49:37.967 --> 02:49:39.802
DEBATED AND SAD BUT I WONDERED

02:49:39.869 --> 02:49:43.139
IF- IN A SIMILAR VEIN WHETHER

02:49:43.206 --> 02:49:45.675
THE BUDGET FOR- WAS CONSIDERING

02:49:45.742 --> 02:49:49.345
SUCH THINGS AS- A- ACROSS THE

02:49:49.412 --> 02:49:53.583
BOARD EXTENSION. ON AN EXISTING

02:49:53.650 --> 02:49:54.684
BUILDING PERMITS AND ZONING

02:49:54.751 --> 02:49:57.387
ENTITLEMENTS GIVEN THAT MUCH

02:49:57.453 --> 02:50:00.423
ACTIVITY HAD TO SEIZE THAT-

02:50:00.490 --> 02:50:01.958
RATHER THAN IN THE SAME WAY

02:50:02.025 --> 02:50:03.359
THAT RATHER YOU SHOULD YOU

02:50:03.426 --> 02:50:04.594
RATHER THAN YOU HAVING TO

02:50:04.661 --> 02:50:07.630
REAPPLY FOR MEDI CAL WHY WOULD

02:50:07.697 --> 02:50:09.599
WE HAVE EXISTING PER. HAVE TO

02:50:09.666 --> 02:50:11.801
BE. CERTAINLY WHICH WERE ISSUED

02:50:11.868 --> 02:50:13.403
ON A LOCAL GOVERNMENT BASIS BUT

02:50:13.469 --> 02:50:17.874
STILL THE- TIME STATE. HAS

02:50:17.941 --> 02:50:20.610
EXTENDED OTHER DEADLINES AND

02:50:20.677 --> 02:50:23.646
SUCH AND- I THINK IT IS WORTH

02:50:23.713 --> 02:50:26.049
CONSIDERING THOSE ADDITIONALLY

02:50:26.115 --> 02:50:28.851
THE STATE MIGHT CONSIDER A

02:50:28.918 --> 02:50:30.753
EXTENSION ON ALL STATE ISSUED

02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:34.090
CANNABIS LICENSES GIVEN THAT. A

02:50:34.157 --> 02:50:36.159
SUCH BUSINESSES AREN'T ELIGIBLE

02:50:36.225 --> 02:50:37.994
OTHER THAN FOR POTENTIALLY SOME

02:50:38.061 --> 02:50:39.696

02:50:39.762 --> 02:50:41.564
ELIGIBLE TO FOR ANY OF THE

FEDERAL RELIEF THAT WAS- A

02:50:44.334 --> 02:50:46.836
PROVIDED IN ANY OF THE FEDERAL

02:50:46.903 --> 02:50:49.872
ACTS SO FAR. AND IF THERE'S IF

02:50:49.939 --> 02:50:50.807
THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN

02:50:50.873 --> 02:50:52.542
CONTEMPLATED I HOPE THAT THAT

02:50:52.609 --> 02:50:53.943
CAN BE DISCUSSED IN THE

02:50:54.010 --> 02:50:56.746
APPROPRIATE BUDGET SAT AND

02:53:09.312 --> 02:53:12.181
BUSINESSES. WITH BELIEVE IT'S A

02:53:12.248 --> 02:53:14.650
SAX MOMENT FIVE MILLION FIVE

02:53:14.717 --> 02:53:19.822
MILLION- OF. A MILLION ACTUALLY

02:53:19.889 --> 02:53:24.527
AND THEN THEY ARE. FOR THE NEXT

02:53:24.594 --> 02:53:25.895
THREE YEARS THAT WOULD LIMIT

02:53:25.962 --> 02:53:28.297
THAT AND SO WHAT WE WERE SAYING

02:53:28.364 --> 02:53:30.767
IS THAT THAT IS IN EFFECT A WAY

02:53:30.833 --> 02:53:32.702
TO ACCELERATE THE TAX PAYMENTS

02:53:32.769 --> 02:53:35.204
THAT THEY MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO

02:53:35.271 --> 02:53:38.207
MAKING IN FUTURE YEARS THERE'S

02:53:38.274 --> 02:53:40.543
NO THIS IS A TAX CATEGORY

02:53:40.610 --> 02:53:42.378
THAT'S KNOWN FOR BEING HARD TO

02:53:42.445 --> 02:53:45.214
FORECAST AND SOME UNPREDICTABLE.

02:53:45.281 --> 02:53:47.383
AND YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T FULLY

02:53:47.450 --> 02:53:48.985
WORK THROUGH THE DETAILS OF IT

02:53:49.051 --> 02:53:50.419
BUT WE SUSPECTED MIGHT BE A

02:53:50.486 --> 02:53:51.821
LITTLE BIT HIGH IN THE-

02:53:51.888 --> 02:53:53.656
ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES- SO

02:53:53.723 --> 02:53:54.924
YOU'RE SO WHAT YOU ARE

02:53:54.991 --> 02:53:57.026
REFERENCING WAS NOT POTENTIALLY

02:53:57.093 --> 02:53:59.262
ADDITIONAL ACTIONS LIKE THAT

02:53:59.328 --> 02:53:59.929
THAT YOU MIGHT RECOMMEND BU

02:53:59.996 --> 02:54:01.898
RATHER THAT THIS MAY HAVE TO BE

02:54:01.964 --> 02:54:03.533
CALCULATED DIFFERENTLY SECTOR

02:54:03.599 --> 02:54:05.368
ACT. THAT'S CORRECT OR THEY

02:54:05.434 --> 02:54:06.803
COULD BE STRUCTURED SLIGHTLY

02:54:06.869 --> 02:54:09.772
DIFFERENTLY THERE'S ANOTHER

02:54:09.839 --> 02:54:12.275
THERE'S ANOTHER. COMPANION

02:54:12.341 --> 02:54:15.344
PROPOSAL WHERE THEY WOULD LIMIT

02:54:15.411 --> 02:54:19.582
TAX CREDITS- BY BUSINESSES- AND

02:54:19.649 --> 02:54:20.716
THAT'S WHERE THE FIVE MILLION

02:54:20.783 --> 02:54:23.085
COMES IN. THE BUSINESSES WOULD

02:54:23.152 --> 02:54:26.088
NOT BE. ABLE TO UTILIZE TAX

02:54:26.155 --> 02:54:28.057
CREDITS IN EXCESS OF FIVE

02:54:28.124 --> 02:54:30.226
MILLION IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. AND

02:54:30.293 --> 02:54:32.061
THEN- THERE'S SORT OF A

02:54:32.128 --> 02:54:33.996
BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS ON THESE

02:54:34.063 --> 02:54:35.765
BUSINESSES AND SO THE

02:54:35.832 --> 02:54:37.567
ADMINISTRATION WE THINK

02:54:37.633 --> 02:54:39.936
GENERALLY CORRECTLY ACCOUNTS

02:54:40.002 --> 02:54:42.205
FOR HOW IF YOU. MAKE A CHANGE

02:54:42.271 --> 02:54:44.006
IN ONE OF THESE YOU YOU REALLY

02:54:44.073 --> 02:54:44.607
KIND OF NEED TO MAKE A CHANGE

02:54:44.674 --> 02:54:46.142
IN TE OTHER IN ORDER TO

02:54:46.209 --> 02:54:49.312
CAPTURE THE- FACT. LONG STORY

02:54:49.378 --> 02:54:51.747
SHORT I BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD-

02:54:51.814 --> 02:54:53.816
YOU KNOW OUR ANALYSIS OF THIS

02:54:53.883 --> 02:54:55.551
IS THAT IT DOES REPRESENTED

02:54:55.618 --> 02:54:57.553
ACCELERATION OF TAX COLLECTIONS

02:54:57.620 --> 02:55:00.923
INTO THE- NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS-

02:55:00.990 --> 02:55:02.758
BUT NOT NECESSARILY INCREASING

02:55:02.825 --> 02:55:06.996
IT ON ANY ONGOING BASIS. AND

02:55:07.063 --> 02:55:08.531
SOME OF THE KIND OF CHANGES

02:55:08.598 --> 02:55:10.867
THAT WE WOULD WE WOULD-

02:55:10.933 --> 02:55:11.968
ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT

02:55:12.034 --> 02:55:16.372
IS. RATHER THAN AND- CAN'T

02:55:16.439 --> 02:55:18.374
CALIBRATING IT FOR LIKE THE NET

02:55:18.441 --> 02:55:20.042
OPERATING LOSSES RATHER HAVING

02:55:20.109 --> 02:55:23.312
THAT APPLY TO BUSINESSES WITH

02:55:23.379 --> 02:55:24.914
NET INCOME OF MILLION DOLLARS

02:55:24.981 --> 02:55:25.848
THAT'S A CASE FOR YOU COULD

02:55:25.915 --> 02:55:27.984
HAVE A ONE BUSINESS COULD. NET

02:55:28.050 --> 02:55:30.419
INCOME OF NINE HUNDRED NINETY

02:55:30.486 --> 02:55:31.621
THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS VERY

02:55:31.687 --> 02:55:33.556
SIMILAR BUSINESS TO BUSINESS

02:55:33.623 --> 02:55:35.157
WITH A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION

02:55:35.224 --> 02:55:38.127
OF NET INCOME SO INSTEAD OF-

02:55:38.194 --> 02:55:40.496
STRUCTURED THAT WAY ONE ONE

02:55:40.563 --> 02:55:41.998
ALTERNATIVE IDEA THAT WE HAVE

02:55:42.064 --> 02:55:45.635
IS. REALLY SET THE- SET A

02:55:45.701 --> 02:55:47.737
THRESHOLD FOR HOW MUCH IN NET

02:55:47.803 --> 02:55:49.372
OPERATING LOSSES ANY BUSINESS

02:55:49.438 --> 02:55:52.174
CAN TAKE AT A HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:55:52.241 --> 02:55:53.042
DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR EXAMPLE

02:55:53.109 --> 02:55:55.378
AND SO. IT WOULD REALLY-

02:55:55.444 --> 02:55:56.879
GENERATE THE ADDITIONAL

02:55:56.946 --> 02:55:57.880
REVENUES THAT THE

02:55:57.947 --> 02:55:59.782
ADMINISTRATION IS TARGETING.

02:55:59.849 --> 02:56:02.051
BUT NOT- TREAT VIRTUALLY

02:56:02.118 --> 02:56:03.552
SIMILAR BUSINESSES IN A

02:56:03.619 --> 02:56:05.421
DIFFERENT WAY UNDER THE TAX

02:56:05.488 --> 02:56:07.924
CODE. THERE ARE OTHER OTHERS

02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:09.659
KIND OF GOING OUTSIDE OF WHAT

02:56:09.725 --> 02:56:11.494
THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING

02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:14.130
OTHER KIND OF TAX. CHANGES THAT

02:56:14.196 --> 02:56:16.699
THERE'D STILL AVOID- SORT OF A

02:56:16.766 --> 02:56:18.768
BROAD BASED TAX INCREASE

02:56:18.834 --> 02:56:20.970
CHANGING TAX RATES. THIS WOULD

02:56:21.037 --> 02:56:22.672
INVOLVE DOING THINGS LIKE

02:56:22.738 --> 02:56:25.808
INCREASE SCENE- THE STATE'S

02:56:25.875 --> 02:56:28.311
CONFORMITY WITH THE FEDERAL TAX

02:56:28.377 --> 02:56:32.114
LAW. SUCH AS- REDUCING OR

02:56:32.181 --> 02:56:33.649
CAPPING THE MORTGAGE INTEREST

02:56:33.716 --> 02:56:35.851
DEDUCTION SO THAT IT CONFORMS

02:56:35.918 --> 02:56:37.887
WITH THE ACTUAL FEDERAL TAX

02:56:37.954 --> 02:56:39.822
LAW. OR ELIMINATING THE

02:56:39.889 --> 02:56:41.357
MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION ON

02:56:41.424 --> 02:56:43.693
SECOND HOMES THOSE ARE TAX

02:56:43.759 --> 02:56:45.161
BENEFITS THAN GENERALLY

02:56:45.227 --> 02:56:47.330
APPROVED TO PEOPLE WITH HIGHER

02:56:47.396 --> 02:56:49.532
INCOMES AND HIGHER MEANS. AND

02:56:49.598 --> 02:56:51.901
SO- IF YOU MOVED IN THAT

02:56:51.968 --> 02:56:53.869
DIRECTION YOU COULD GENERATE

02:56:53.936 --> 02:56:55.838
SOME ADDITIONAL REVENUE WITHOUT

02:56:55.905 --> 02:56:58.507
OF FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGING THE

02:56:58.574 --> 02:57:01.110
TAX CODE. THERE THERE IS WE

02:57:01.177 --> 02:57:02.778
HAVE A WE HAVE SORT OF A LIST

02:57:02.845 --> 02:57:04.680
OF IDEAS KIND OF ALONG THESE

02:57:04.747 --> 02:57:07.717
LINES THAT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO.

02:57:07.783 --> 02:57:10.586
WORK WITH YOU ON- AND I'LL STOP

02:57:10.653 --> 02:57:11.687
THERE UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO GO

02:57:11.754 --> 02:57:14.090
FURTHER ON THIS NO I APPRECIATE

02:57:14.156 --> 02:57:16.125
THAT. I REMEMBER THE DISCUSSION

02:57:16.192 --> 02:57:17.860
THERE WAS DISCUSSION LAST YEAR

02:57:17.927 --> 02:57:19.395
IN OUR TAX CONFORMITY ACTION

02:57:19.462 --> 02:57:20.830
WHY THE MORTGAGE ON SECOND

02:57:20.896 --> 02:57:23.199
HOMES WAS NOT INCLUDED. SO I

02:57:23.265 --> 02:57:24.133
APPRECIATE YOUR RAISING IT NOW

02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:26.535
AND- I WERE IN A OBVIOUSLY IT

02:57:26.602 --> 02:57:28.471
MORE TRUNCATED THE BUDGET

02:57:28.537 --> 02:57:30.306
DISCUSSION THAN USUAL BUT

02:57:30.373 --> 02:57:32.608
PERHAPS WE CAN STILL- ENTERTAIN

02:57:32.675 --> 02:57:35.511
SUCH CONCEPTS. ON NORMAN A

02:57:35.578 --> 02:57:36.278
DISCARDED DEPARTMENT OF

02:57:36.345 --> 02:57:40.082
FINANCE- MY QUESTION HERE IS-

02:57:40.149 --> 02:57:41.617
ON PAGE THIRTY OF THE MAY

02:57:41.684 --> 02:57:45.588
REVISION- SORRY ON PAGE THIRTY

02:57:45.654 --> 02:57:47.289
HER. THESE MIKES ARE HARD

02:57:47.356 --> 02:57:48.657
ESPECIALLY WITH THESE MASKS IN

02:57:48.724 --> 02:57:51.027
FRONT OF US ANYWAY ON PAGE

02:57:51.093 --> 02:57:52.361
THIRTY OF THE MARY VISION.

02:57:52.428 --> 02:57:54.764
THERE IS A REFERENCE THIS IS IN

02:57:54.830 --> 02:57:56.732
THE HOUSING AREA. THERE IS A

02:57:56.799 --> 02:57:58.901
REFERENCE WHICH I SUPPORT WHICH

02:57:58.968 --> 02:58:00.770
IS. ACTION THAT COULD GUARD

02:58:00.836 --> 02:58:02.772
AGAINST PRIVATE SECTOR ACTORS

02:58:02.838 --> 02:58:05.808
BUYING UP DISTRESSED ASSETS- AS

02:58:05.875 --> 02:58:07.443
WE KNOW THAT OCCURRED DURING

02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:09.378
THE LAST RECESSION NANDED TO

02:58:09.445 --> 02:58:11.147
HAS NOT BEEN A BENEFIT TO MOST

02:58:11.213 --> 02:58:12.748
OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. ON I

02:58:12.815 --> 02:58:14.784
WON'T I DON'T NEED TO GO INTO

02:58:14.850 --> 02:58:16.852
DISCUSS INTO ELABORATION ON

02:58:16.919 --> 02:58:19.655
THAT BUT I WONDERED. WHY HE DID

02:58:19.722 --> 02:58:21.357
NOT SIEU SPECIFICS SOLVE

02:58:21.424 --> 02:58:24.727
REFERENCE PRICE ON NO SPECIFICS

02:58:24.794 --> 02:58:27.329
ARE THOSE. THE EITHER YOU CAN

02:58:27.396 --> 02:58:28.898
GIVE ME AN ANSWER NOW OR A HOPE

02:58:28.964 --> 02:58:30.933
THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE A GETS

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.469
INTO THIS AND- MAKE SURE THERE

02:58:33.536 --> 02:58:38.607
ARE SOME SPECIFICS. WE WILL GET

02:58:38.674 --> 02:58:39.775
BACK TO YOU IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE

02:58:39.842 --> 02:58:42.044
PROCESS ON SPECIFICS OKAY GREAT

02:58:42.111 --> 02:58:43.045
AND NOW I HAVE JUST A COUPLE

02:58:43.112 --> 02:58:44.980
OF. OF QUESTIONS ON THE

02:58:45.047 --> 02:58:46.482
CORRECTION SIDE MY SUBCOMMITTEE

02:58:46.549 --> 02:58:49.385
PUT A SUB FIVE I WILL OF COURSE

02:58:49.452 --> 02:58:52.088
MAKE THOSE PRIMARILY DURING MY

02:58:52.154 --> 02:58:53.823
OWN HEARING BUT THE FIRST THING

02:58:53.889 --> 02:58:55.858
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO- KIND OF

02:58:55.925 --> 02:58:57.993
MADE A NOTE OR MAKE A COMMENT

02:58:58.060 --> 02:59:00.362
ON. IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE

02:59:00.429 --> 02:59:02.431
ELEVEN OF THE REVISED WHICH HAS

02:59:02.498 --> 02:59:04.733
A CHART THAT LISTS THE ARE

02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:07.503
AGENCIES IN THEIR GENERAL FUND.

02:59:07.570 --> 02:59:09.805
EXPENDITURES FOR NINETEEN

02:59:09.872 --> 02:59:11.207
TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE

02:59:11.273 --> 02:59:12.708
AND IN THAT CHART IN IN EFFECT

02:59:12.775 --> 02:59:15.678
SHOWS WHAT THE GF REDUCTIONS

02:59:15.744 --> 02:59:17.847
ARE GOING TO BE PER AGENCY IF

02:59:17.913 --> 02:59:19.815
THE BUDGET IS ADOPTED AS THE

02:59:19.882 --> 02:59:23.219
MAY REVISE IN OF. OF PROPOSES

02:59:23.285 --> 02:59:27.089
AND IN THAT CHART. THE CDC ARE

02:59:27.156 --> 02:59:29.525
HAS THE LOWEST PERCENT

02:59:29.592 --> 02:59:32.094
REDUCTION OF ALL AGENCIES IT IS

02:59:32.161 --> 02:59:35.464
UNDER 1% ALL OTHER AGENCIES THE

02:59:35.531 --> 02:59:38.534
NEXT LOWEST AGENCY IS AROUND 6%

02:59:38.601 --> 02:59:40.302
ALL OTHER AGENCIES ARE IN THE

02:59:40.369 --> 02:59:43.806
ORDER OF 17% FORTY PERCENT. AND

02:59:43.873 --> 02:59:44.640
IF YOU LOOK AT ENVIRONMENTAL

02:59:44.707 --> 02:59:48.077
PROTECTION IT'S A 94% GENERAL

02:59:48.144 --> 02:59:50.946
FUND REDUCTION NOW OBVIOUSLY.

02:59:51.013 --> 02:59:53.883
PERCENTS ARE SOMEWHAT ARE YOU

02:59:53.949 --> 02:59:55.484
CAN GET IN THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS

02:59:55.551 --> 02:59:57.153
CAN VERY BECAUSE IF A BUDGET IS

02:59:57.219 --> 03:00:00.089
VERY LARGE. A 1% REDUCTION CAN

03:00:00.156 --> 03:00:07.096
BE BIG BUT ACTUALLY. DE UM. THE

03:00:07.163 --> 03:00:09.198
IF YOU LOOK AT IT RELATIVE TO

03:00:09.265 --> 03:00:12.234
THE EXPENDITURE LEVELS I GUESS

03:00:12.301 --> 03:00:14.503
THE REAL QUESTION I HAVE IS

03:00:14.570 --> 03:00:18.407
WHAT. WELL I APPRECIATE SOME OF

03:00:18.474 --> 03:00:22.745
THE PROPOSALS WITHIN BE A SUB

03:00:22.811 --> 03:00:23.546
FIVE CATEGORY IN THEIR SOME

03:00:23.612 --> 03:00:25.648
GOOD ONES THAT REDUCE SPENDING

03:00:25.714 --> 03:00:27.850
THERE'S ALSO A VERY SIGNIFICANT

03:00:27.917 --> 03:00:30.219
AMOUNT OF INCREASES GF

03:00:30.286 --> 03:00:32.354
INCREASES WHICH I THINK

03:00:32.421 --> 03:00:34.857
CONTRIBUTE TO THE FACT THAT

03:00:34.924 --> 03:00:35.457
THERE'S ONLY 1% REDUCTION IN

03:00:35.524 --> 03:00:38.794
GIVEN THAT. THE WE ARE FACING A

03:00:38.861 --> 03:00:39.662
FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR

03:00:39.728 --> 03:00:41.830
DEFICIT I'M KIND OF SURPRISED

03:00:41.897 --> 03:00:43.899
THAT- WHEN DEPARTMENT IS

03:00:43.966 --> 03:00:45.668
GETTING SUCH A MINIMALIST HAIR

03:00:45.734 --> 03:00:50.639
CUT. SENATOR SKINNER ON THAT

03:00:50.706 --> 03:00:52.208
ISSUE ALL ANSWER VERY BRIEFLY

03:00:52.274 --> 03:00:53.642
AND MAKES YOU POINTS I THINK

03:00:53.709 --> 03:00:57.346
NUMBER. ONE AND THEN YOU KNOW

03:00:57.413 --> 03:00:57.913
THERE'S PROBABLY BETTER THAN

03:00:57.980 --> 03:00:59.882
ANY THAT THAT DEPART IS A-

03:00:59.949 --> 03:01:01.317
COURT MANDATES AND OTHER

03:01:01.383 --> 03:01:03.686
REQUIREMENTS THAT MAKE IT HARD

03:01:03.752 --> 03:01:05.287
TO WHICH WE REDUCE COSTS BUT

03:01:05.354 --> 03:01:07.256
MORE IMPORTANTLY NUMBER EXCUSE.

03:01:07.323 --> 03:01:09.325
CURRENT POPULATION TRENDS HOLD

03:01:09.391 --> 03:01:10.593

NEXT SEVERAL YEARS SO THAT

03:01:16.799 --> 03:01:22.504
SHOULD HOPEFULLY CREATES. AND

03:01:22.571 --> 03:01:24.273
THAT'S OF COURSE WE WILL WE

03:01:24.340 --> 03:01:25.407
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING AND WILL

03:01:25.474 --> 03:01:27.643
CONTINUE TO DISCUSS BUT IT

03:01:27.710 --> 03:01:29.078
DOESN'T GIVE ANY RELIEF TO

03:01:29.144 --> 03:01:30.879
THOSE PEOPLE WHETHER THEY ARE

03:01:30.946 --> 03:01:34.450
OUR STUDENTS. FOR OUR- LOOK

03:01:34.516 --> 03:01:35.684
VERY LOW INCOME PEOPLE AREN'T

03:01:35.751 --> 03:01:37.453
THE MANY OTHERS WHO WERE VERY

03:01:37.519 --> 03:01:41.357
ECONOMICALLY. IMPACTED BY OUR

03:01:41.423 --> 03:01:46.328
BY THE BY THE. THE CUTS WE

03:01:46.395 --> 03:01:47.630
WOULD HAVE TO MAKE TO MEET OUR

03:01:47.696 --> 03:01:50.599
DEFICIT SO I IN WHEN YOU

03:01:50.666 --> 03:01:52.201
BROUGHT UP POPULATION IN THIS

03:01:52.268 --> 03:01:53.035
WILL BE DISCUSSED OBVIOUSLY

03:01:53.102 --> 03:01:55.904
MORE IN MY A SUBCOMMITTEE THE

03:01:55.971 --> 03:01:57.706
MAY REVISE SHOWS THE AVERAGE

03:01:57.773 --> 03:02:00.943
DAILY POPULATION AT ABOUT A

03:02:01.010 --> 03:02:02.478
1-002-300-0700 WERE ADDS THE

03:02:02.544 --> 03:02:05.481
SPRING PROJECTIONS PRIOR TO ANY

03:02:05.547 --> 03:02:07.283
IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH COVETED.

03:02:07.349 --> 03:02:09.018
HELLO ONLY HAD AN AVERAGE OF

03:02:09.084 --> 03:02:11.086
ABOUT A THOUSAND INMATE LOWER

03:02:11.153 --> 03:02:14.223
SO ONE HUNDRED AND 220-005-0030

03:02:14.290 --> 03:02:15.824
SIX YOU DON'T NEED TO COMMENT A

03:02:15.891 --> 03:02:19.395
PURELY- RAISE IT AS IT'S A MUCH

03:02:19.461 --> 03:02:22.965
HIGHER POPULATION NUMBER THEN-

03:02:23.032 --> 03:02:25.301
OTHER DOCUMENTS SHOW AND THAT

03:02:25.367 --> 03:02:28.437
MAY I IF WE WERE SEEING THE

03:02:28.504 --> 03:02:30.839
ORIGINAL POPULATION NUMBERS IT

03:02:30.906 --> 03:02:31.440
MIGHT ASSIST DUSTIN TERMS OF

03:02:31.507 --> 03:02:34.176
THESE CAUGHT. BUT I'LL LEAVE IT

03:02:34.243 --> 03:02:36.779
AT THAT AND WE'LL DISCUSS THEM

03:02:36.845 --> 03:02:41.784
IN MY SUBCOMMITTEE. ON THE- ON

03:02:41.850 --> 03:02:44.953
THE ISSUE OF THE DIVISION OF

03:02:45.020 --> 03:02:46.689
JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT I

03:02:46.755 --> 03:02:48.857
JUST REYES THIS I THINK THERE

03:02:48.924 --> 03:02:50.826
WAS A LOT OF DEBATE LAST YEAR

03:02:50.893 --> 03:02:53.662
THE- ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED

03:02:53.729 --> 03:02:56.632
ELIMINATING THE JJ AND IN OUR

03:02:56.699 --> 03:02:58.233
INCORPORATING IT INTO THE

03:02:58.300 --> 03:03:00.202
DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES

03:03:00.269 --> 03:03:02.338
THIS BUDGET RECISIONS THAT. AND

03:03:02.404 --> 03:03:06.508
WOULD MOVE I THINK SENATOR OF A

03:03:06.575 --> 03:03:08.711
NELSON REFERENCED WOULD MOVE

03:03:08.777 --> 03:03:12.481
FOLKS TO THE- COUNTY FACILITIES

03:03:12.548 --> 03:03:16.919
WHICH OF HAS BEEN BASICALLY

03:03:16.985 --> 03:03:18.754
BEEN SOMETHING THAT MANY

03:03:18.821 --> 03:03:21.156
ADVOCATES HAVE ADVOCATED FOR A

03:03:21.223 --> 03:03:22.391
LONG TIME AND ARE COUNTY

03:03:22.458 --> 03:03:25.694
FACILITIES ARE- UNDER UTILIZED

03:03:25.761 --> 03:03:28.964
PRESENTLY BUT I JUST RAISE IT

03:03:29.031 --> 03:03:30.799
BECAUSE- I THINK WE THERE NEEDS

03:03:30.866 --> 03:03:33.869
TO BE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS IN ON

03:03:33.936 --> 03:03:35.304
HOW THE COSTS WILL BE

03:03:35.371 --> 03:03:37.306
CALCULATED TO ENSURE THAT THE

03:03:37.373 --> 03:03:39.675
COSTS WE BEAR THE STATE BEARS.

03:03:39.742 --> 03:03:42.177
DUE TO THIS CHANGE DOESN'T

03:03:42.244 --> 03:03:44.713
RESULT IN A HIGHER COST THAN

03:03:44.780 --> 03:03:46.281
THE STATE THE COST THE STATE IS

03:03:46.348 --> 03:03:48.484
CURRENTLY I'M EXPERIENCING SO

03:03:48.550 --> 03:03:50.386
JUST RAISE THAT IS A LITTLE

03:03:50.452 --> 03:03:52.688
MARKER AND THEN FINALLY. THERE

03:03:52.755 --> 03:03:56.925

SURE THAT THIS PROGRAM MOVES

03:07:34.776 --> 03:07:37.045
FORWARD. SECONDLY I WOULD BE

03:07:37.112 --> 03:07:38.380
REMISS IF I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT

03:07:38.447 --> 03:07:40.415
MY MOBILE HOME PEOPLE AS A

03:07:40.482 --> 03:07:41.450
CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE

03:07:41.516 --> 03:07:43.652
ON MOBILE HOMES. THE REDUCTION

03:07:43.719 --> 03:07:46.121
OF FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE

03:07:46.188 --> 03:07:48.123
THOUSAND TWO AB ONE SEVENTY

03:07:48.190 --> 03:07:49.057
THREE THE IMPLEMENT THE

03:07:49.124 --> 03:07:50.525
IMPLEMENTATION WILL MEAN THERE

03:07:50.592 --> 03:07:52.527
IS LESS STAFF. TO ASSIST MOBILE

03:07:52.594 --> 03:07:54.363
HOME OWNERS AND APPLYING FOR

THE MOBILE HOME REGISTRATION.

03:07:56.498 --> 03:07:58.533
FEE AND TAX WAIVER. AS I'VE

03:07:58.600 --> 03:08:00.502
SAID MANY TIMES MOBILE HOMES

03:08:00.569 --> 03:08:02.471
ARE THE LAST BASTION OF

03:08:02.537 --> 03:08:04.406
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IF THESE

03:08:04.473 --> 03:08:05.907

THEIR PAYMENTS AT THEIR KICKED

03:08:07.309 --> 03:08:10.545
OUT. IF THEY ARE OF THE LETTER

03:08:10.612 --> 03:08:11.513
THE MOBILE HOME GO BACK TO THE

03:08:11.580 --> 03:08:13.115
BANK THERE MOST LIKELY GOING TO

03:08:13.181 --> 03:08:15.217
BE IN A ON THE STREETS. SO WHAT

03:08:15.283 --> 03:08:18.720
I WOULD ASK IS FIVE HUNDRED

03:08:18.787 --> 03:08:19.287
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR

03:08:19.354 --> 03:08:21.289
REDUCTION. IF WE CANNOT FIND

03:08:21.356 --> 03:08:24.192
THAT MONEY TO HELP AND HELP

03:08:24.259 --> 03:08:25.761

IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS

03:08:31.466 --> 03:08:34.202
REDUCTION CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT

03:08:34.269 --> 03:08:35.370
IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

03:08:35.437 --> 03:08:36.872
WEEKS THEN THE WAIVER TO

03:08:36.938 --> 03:08:39.875
DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY

03:08:39.941 --> 03:08:41.476
TWENTY ONE. TO ME THAT SEEMS

03:08:41.543 --> 03:08:42.978
LIKE A REASONABLE COMPROMISE

03:08:43.045 --> 03:08:44.680

03:09:03.398 --> 03:09:04.499
STATEMENTS FIRST AND I DO HAVE

03:09:04.566 --> 03:09:06.535
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW

03:09:06.601 --> 03:09:08.036
I HEARD FROM THE CHAIR WHEN WE

03:09:08.103 --> 03:09:09.771
STARTED ABOUT BEING TRANSPARENT

03:09:09.838 --> 03:09:11.606
AND- YOU KNOW THROUGH THIS

03:09:11.673 --> 03:09:12.908
PROCESS THERE'S A VOTE I COULD

03:09:12.974 --> 03:09:14.710
TAKE BACK IT WOULD BE SB EIGHTY

03:09:14.776 --> 03:09:15.644
NINE BECAUSE I FELT. I FEEL

03:09:15.711 --> 03:09:17.746
LIKE THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF

03:09:17.813 --> 03:09:20.015
THIS HAS BEEN LEFT OUT OF. THE

03:09:20.082 --> 03:09:23.785
PROCESS WE WERE ENGAGED I DON'T

03:09:23.852 --> 03:09:25.554
BELIEVE IT ALL AND SO FOR THE

03:09:25.620 --> 03:09:29.458
FUTURE VOTES I WILL NOT BE.

03:09:29.524 --> 03:09:32.327
ADVOCATING FOR. US CONTROL

03:09:32.394 --> 03:09:33.895
ACCOUNTS- FOR THE

03:09:33.962 --> 03:09:35.097
ADMINISTRATION I DON'T THINK

03:09:35.163 --> 03:09:36.231
IT'S THE WILL OF THE

03:09:36.298 --> 03:09:37.566
DEMONSTRATION OF THE PAST HAS

03:09:37.632 --> 03:09:40.502
NOT BEEN GOOD SO- AND I WANTED

03:09:40.569 --> 03:09:43.271
TO ASK. INSPIRATION TO ON YOU

03:09:43.338 --> 03:09:44.940
SAID SOMETHING ABOUT VACCINES

03:09:45.006 --> 03:09:46.007
SO I WANT TO KIND OF GET THE

03:09:46.074 --> 03:09:48.543
VISION. THIS BUDGET IS PRETTY.

03:09:48.610 --> 03:09:49.745
LAID OUT IN A WAY WHERE WE'RE

03:09:49.811 --> 03:09:51.413
GOING TO BE PUSHING DOWN ON

03:09:51.480 --> 03:09:53.081
COUNTIES AND CITIES WE'RE GOING

03:09:53.148 --> 03:09:54.583
TO BE SHIFTING FIRES AND

03:09:54.649 --> 03:09:56.985
BARRING MONIES- AND I KNOW THAT

03:09:57.052 --> 03:09:59.187
CITIES RELY ON PROPERTY OR OR

03:09:59.254 --> 03:10:01.623
SALES TAX MAINLY TO IN THEIR

03:10:01.690 --> 03:10:03.391
BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

03:10:03.458 --> 03:10:05.360
AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

03:10:05.427 --> 03:10:06.962
GENERATE THAT REVENUE NOW WE

03:10:07.028 --> 03:10:08.563
HAVE HAD THE MONEY'S COMING

03:10:08.630 --> 03:10:09.698
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:10:09.765 --> 03:10:11.900
THANK GOD- AND COUNTY SURVIVE

03:10:11.967 --> 03:10:13.935
MAINLY ON PROPERTY TAX SO THOSE

03:10:14.002 --> 03:10:15.704
ARE THE- THE TWO AREAS IT THERE

03:10:15.771 --> 03:10:17.906
WE GET THE HAVE BASICALLY NO

03:10:17.973 --> 03:10:20.041
ROOM. FOR US TO PUT OUR

03:10:20.108 --> 03:10:21.843
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THEM SO I

03:10:21.910 --> 03:10:24.179
WANT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THEM

03:10:24.246 --> 03:10:25.046
AND CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT. MANY

03:10:25.113 --> 03:10:26.648
OTHER MEMBERS BROUGHT UP ABOUT

03:10:26.715 --> 03:10:28.850
THE POPULATION DIVIDE IN WHO'S

03:10:28.917 --> 03:10:29.484
GOING TO END UP WITH WHAT. POTS

03:10:29.551 --> 03:10:31.820
OF MONEY. SO THAT I'D LIKE TO

03:10:31.887 --> 03:10:32.788
BE ANSWERED AND I LIKE TO THEN

03:10:32.854 --> 03:10:36.024
THE OVERALL. VISION OF WHAT.

03:10:36.091 --> 03:10:40.095
THE TIME FRAME IS. FOR COMING

03:10:40.162 --> 03:10:42.697
OUT OF THIS WE WERE TOLD- BY

03:10:42.764 --> 03:10:44.533
THE GOVERNOR'S CHIEF OF STAFF

03:10:44.599 --> 03:10:47.302
AND DOCTOR GALLEY IN MARCH

03:10:47.369 --> 03:10:49.971
THAT. THE PANDEMIC WOULD BE

03:10:50.038 --> 03:10:52.174
INTEL MAY THAT HE SUPPOSEDLY

03:10:52.240 --> 03:10:54.476
SUPPRESSES IT- SO IT'S GONNA BE

03:10:54.543 --> 03:10:56.111
SHORT TERM AND THE GOAL POST

03:10:56.178 --> 03:10:57.546
KEEPS MOVING SO I'M KIND OF

03:10:57.612 --> 03:10:58.780
TRYING TO FIND OUT I HEARD THE

03:10:58.847 --> 03:11:01.383
BOARD ARE WE GONNA WAIT TILL-THERE'S A VACCINATION. BECAUSE

03:11:01.449 --> 03:11:04.252
IF THAT'S THE CASE.

03:11:04.319 --> 03:11:06.054
CALIFORNIA'S IN OF IN A REALLY

03:11:06.121 --> 03:11:07.189
BAD WAY WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

03:11:07.255 --> 03:11:09.858
MONEY TO- SHIFT AROUND SO THOSE

03:11:09.925 --> 03:11:11.359
THOSE ARE WHAT'S THE LONG TERM

03:11:11.426 --> 03:11:14.296
VISION WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE-

03:11:14.362 --> 03:11:15.997
WHEN WE GET BACK SHE THERE'S

03:11:16.064 --> 03:11:16.565
AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS

03:11:16.631 --> 03:11:18.233
BUDGETS OF ABOUT. GETTING

03:11:18.300 --> 03:11:20.902
BUSINESSES BACK GOING IN SO

03:11:20.969 --> 03:11:21.503
THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS

03:11:21.570 --> 03:11:29.110
SHIFTING. SENATOR DOLLINGER ON

03:11:29.177 --> 03:11:30.879
THOSE QUESTIONS AT FIRST I

03:11:30.946 --> 03:11:32.714
DEFINITELY WANT TO CLARIFY.

03:11:32.781 --> 03:11:34.883
WHEN REFERRING TO A POSSIBLE

03:11:34.950 --> 03:11:36.017
AND I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW THE

03:11:36.084 --> 03:11:37.152
VACCINES FOR THE COMPANY

03:11:37.219 --> 03:11:39.955
NINETEEN. VIRUS IN THE FUTURE-

03:11:40.021 --> 03:11:42.257
I WAS REFERRING TO THAT AS- ANY

03:11:42.324 --> 03:11:43.658
PLAN A SERIES OF STAGES IN

03:11:43.725 --> 03:11:45.994
WHICH- WE GET CONTROL OUT OF.

03:11:46.061 --> 03:11:47.696
THE EFFECTS OF THE SECOND AND I

03:11:47.762 --> 03:11:49.698
JUST HAD ON ALL OF OUR LIVES

03:11:49.764 --> 03:11:50.599
BUT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

03:11:50.665 --> 03:11:51.967
THAT THERE ARE INTERMEDIATE

03:11:52.033 --> 03:11:54.236
STAGES BETWEEN. NOW AND THEN

03:11:54.302 --> 03:11:55.470
STARTING WITH THE STATE'S

03:11:55.537 --> 03:11:57.372
CAREFUL RE OPENING STARTING

03:11:57.439 --> 03:11:58.940
WITH INVESTMENTS IN A CONTACT

03:11:59.007 --> 03:12:00.308
FACING OUTWARDS AND I THINK

03:12:00.375 --> 03:12:01.576
YOU'RE SEEING SOME OF THAT.

03:12:01.643 --> 03:12:02.744
FROM BEING MINISTRATION OVER

03:12:02.811 --> 03:12:07.749
THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS WE KNOW

03:12:07.816 --> 03:12:08.383
THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO.

03:12:08.450 --> 03:12:09.150
MORE QUICKLY. THERE ARE SOME

03:12:09.217 --> 03:12:09.951
PEOPLE WHO MAY AFRAID OF

03:12:10.018 --> 03:12:12.954
QUICKLY IT IS MOVING. CERTAINLY

03:12:13.021 --> 03:12:15.023
THE CALL A SECOND. AS SAFELY AS

03:12:15.090 --> 03:12:17.626
POSSIBLE CONTINUE TO REOPEN THE

03:12:17.692 --> 03:12:20.695
ECONOMY. PLACE WHERE WE WERE

03:12:20.762 --> 03:12:22.330
BEFORE THE STAINED AND WITHOUT

03:12:22.397 --> 03:12:24.666
JEOPARDIZING HEALTH AND SAFETY.

03:12:24.733 --> 03:12:26.368
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT YOU

03:12:26.434 --> 03:12:27.569
SPECIFIC ITEMS THAT YOU

03:12:27.636 --> 03:12:29.070
MENTIONED. FIRST ON LOCAL

03:12:29.137 --> 03:12:31.139
GOVERNMENTS RECOGNIZING THE

03:12:31.206 --> 03:12:33.041
STRESS WE WERE UNDER IS WHY AT

03:12:33.108 --> 03:12:35.076
THE STATE EVEN THOUGH WE FACE

03:12:35.143 --> 03:12:35.977
SO MANY OF OUR OWN BY

03:12:36.044 --> 03:12:38.246
SUPPRESSORS. MINISTRATION ALL

03:12:38.313 --> 03:12:40.015
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

03:12:40.081 --> 03:12:41.850
RESOLVE THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS WE

03:12:41.917 --> 03:12:43.351
DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WAS RIGHT.

03:12:43.418 --> 03:12:45.520
ALL OF THE STATE ALLOCATION AND

03:12:45.587 --> 03:12:47.489
I'M NOT GOING HOURS USING ALL

03:12:47.555 --> 03:12:48.623
FOR THE STATE GIVEN THE

03:12:48.690 --> 03:12:50.458
SIGNIFICANT PRESSURES LOCAL

03:12:50.525 --> 03:12:51.526
GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDER AND THE

03:12:51.593 --> 03:12:56.965
FACT THAT WE ARE PARTNERS. THEY

03:12:57.032 --> 03:12:59.301
ARE IN THE- REYES. THE SERVER.

03:12:59.367 --> 03:13:00.869
THAT WE ARE SOMETIMES AND THEN

03:13:00.936 --> 03:13:02.570
THIS PLANE ON GONNA TRY TO OVER

03:13:02.637 --> 03:13:03.571
TO CHAMBER GOING TO TALK A

03:13:03.638 --> 03:13:04.406
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT REFUGE

03:13:04.472 --> 03:13:05.840
FORECAST. WHAT WILL STATE

03:13:05.907 --> 03:13:08.176
ACROSS A- IN DEVELOPING THAT

03:13:08.243 --> 03:13:09.945
FOR. WE ANTICIPATED AND THAT

03:13:10.011 --> 03:13:12.213
ACTUALLY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

03:13:12.280 --> 03:13:14.516
WEEKS AND MONTHS. THE ECONOMY

03:13:14.582 --> 03:13:16.584
WOULD BEGIN TO RIO. OVER THE

03:13:16.651 --> 03:13:18.286
COURSE OF THE LATE SPRING AND

03:13:18.353 --> 03:13:20.722
SUMMER I EVEN WITH THAT AS SOME

03:13:20.789 --> 03:13:22.857
OF THESE SCARS ON THE ECONOMY.

03:13:22.924 --> 03:13:24.259
I WOULD REVERBERATE FOR A

03:13:24.326 --> 03:13:25.493
COUPLE OF YEARS AND OBVIOUSLY

03:13:25.560 --> 03:13:27.996
OUR GOAL AS THE STATE IS TO

03:13:28.063 --> 03:13:29.331
MAKE THAT RECOVERY PROCESS AS

03:13:29.397 --> 03:13:31.166
SHORT AS POSSIBLE. BUT THAT'S

03:13:31.232 --> 03:13:32.567
WHAT WE'RE ANTICIPATING RIGHT

03:13:32.634 --> 03:13:33.668
NOW AND WILL BE TREATED ALREADY

03:13:33.735 --> 03:13:36.538
J. JUST. BRIEFLY TALKED ABOUT-

03:13:36.604 --> 03:13:40.742
THE INPUTS INTO. OUR REVENUE

03:13:40.809 --> 03:13:43.511
FORECASTS. GOOD AFTERNOON ARMS

03:13:43.578 --> 03:13:46.081
SO WE WE'RE EXPECT A

03:13:46.147 --> 03:13:47.816
SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN ALL THE

03:13:47.882 --> 03:13:50.552
REVENUE SOURCES OF THE MAJOR

03:13:50.618 --> 03:13:52.187
REVENUE SOURCES FROM THE STATE

03:13:52.253 --> 03:13:56.358
I THINK- ARE YOU OVER 20% LINE

03:13:56.424 --> 03:13:58.126
IN PERSONAL INCOME TAX SALES

03:13:58.193 --> 03:14:00.495
TAX INCORPORATION TAX FOR THE

03:14:00.562 --> 03:14:02.964
BUDGET YEAR. I THINK ONE ONE

03:14:03.031 --> 03:14:06.101
BRIGHT SPOT FOR LOCAL

03:14:06.167 --> 03:14:08.770
GOVERNMENTS- TO DRESS YOUR

03:14:08.837 --> 03:14:11.239
CONCERN IS THAT OF THE PROPERTY

03:14:11.306 --> 03:14:14.042
TAXES IS SO WE EXPECT TO FARE.

03:14:14.109 --> 03:14:15.477
BETTER THAN THAN THE OTHER

03:14:15.543 --> 03:14:17.445
MAJOR REVENUE SOURCES- I'M MORE

03:14:17.512 --> 03:14:20.181
EXPECTING ANY- SOMEWHAT OF A OF

03:14:20.248 --> 03:14:23.184
A DECLINE. FROM WHAT WE HAD TO

03:14:23.251 --> 03:14:24.686
GET WE ARE PROJECTED TO

03:14:24.753 --> 03:14:25.754
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT NOT

03:14:25.820 --> 03:14:28.923
NEARLY AS SIGNIFICANT AS

03:14:28.990 --> 03:14:29.524
OVERSEEING AND YET THE REVENUE

03:14:29.591 --> 03:14:31.059
SOURCE. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

03:14:31.126 --> 03:14:31.860
OTHER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT

03:14:31.926 --> 03:14:33.995
STONE SO THANK YOU I TOTALLY

03:14:34.062 --> 03:14:34.729
UNDERSTAND WAS A CASE

SUPERVISOR FOR SIXTEEN YEARS

03:14:36.264 --> 03:14:37.298
AND WE WON'T SEE THE REVENUE

03:14:37.365 --> 03:14:40.001
DROP. IN COUNTIES UNTIL

03:14:40.068 --> 03:14:41.102
EIGHTEEN MONTHS BECAUSE THERE

03:14:41.169 --> 03:14:43.071
OF THE CYCLE IS TAKE THAT LONG

03:14:43.138 --> 03:14:45.140
BUT CITIES ARE DIRECTLY

03:14:45.206 --> 03:14:47.108
IMPACTED IMMEDIATELY BY SALES

03:14:47.175 --> 03:14:50.278

COVERS IT THE- THOUGHT THERE

03:14:52.547 --> 03:14:53.748
BUT I'VE MY GOOD IN MY BOOK. MY

03:14:53.815 --> 03:14:55.383
POINT IS THAT WE CANNOT PUSH

03:14:55.450 --> 03:14:58.219
DOWN ANYMORE LIABILITY OR-

03:14:58.286 --> 03:14:59.754
OBLIGATIONS TO CITIES AND

03:16:06.421 --> 03:16:09.157
SENATOR WHAT I'LL SAY HERE IS I

03:16:09.224 --> 03:16:10.758
THINK THE ADMINISTRATION

03:16:10.825 --> 03:16:13.128
RECOGNIZES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF

03:16:13.194 --> 03:16:14.496
THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING IN

03:16:14.562 --> 03:16:17.599
ESPECIALLY IN A PUBLIC FACING.

03:16:17.665 --> 03:16:20.101
AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT MIKEY D.

03:16:49.697 --> 03:16:52.100
SOME ASK FEDERAL ASSISTANCE HAS

03:16:52.167 --> 03:16:53.601
BEEN FORTHCOMING IN OUR EFFORTS

03:16:53.668 --> 03:16:54.936
TO REFORM THOSE AS QUICKLY AS

03:16:55.003 --> 03:16:56.337
POSSIBLE. I THINK THE OTHER

03:16:56.404 --> 03:16:57.972
CHALLENGE AND THIS IS A GOOD

03:16:58.039 --> 03:16:59.107
THING THAT. THE FEDERAL

03:16:59.174 --> 03:17:00.909
GOVERNMENT CRAFTED ON ITS OWN

03:17:00.975 --> 03:17:02.644

SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER WEEK

03:17:10.218 --> 03:17:11.786
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. THERE WAS

03:17:11.853 --> 03:17:13.121
ALSO THE CAN DOWN THE KIND OF

03:17:16.824 --> 03:17:17.926
TRADITIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT

03:17:17.992 --> 03:17:19.294
INSURANCE AT THE STATE LEVEL

03:17:19.360 --> 03:17:21.196
BUT ALSO LOST HER JOB I THINK

03:17:21.262 --> 03:17:21.996
THE CHALLENGES WHEN YOU HAVE

03:17:22.063 --> 03:17:23.831
ALL THESE DIFFERENT PIECES ON

03:17:23.898 --> 03:17:25.767
TOP OF EACH OTHER. YOU PUT IT

03:17:25.833 --> 03:17:27.535
ON TOP OF ANY AGE OLD

03:17:27.602 --> 03:17:29.671

03:17:39.547 --> 03:17:40.315
YOU KNOW I THINK IN THE GREAT

03:17:40.381 --> 03:17:42.884

THAT YOU MENTION. THE FIRST

03:21:24.872 --> 03:21:26.507
POINT SPEAKING VERY BROADLY IS

03:21:26.574 --> 03:21:28.509
THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN

03:21:28.576 --> 03:21:29.944
THE ITEMS THAT WERE IN THE

TRIGGER VERSES WERE NOT THESE

03:21:32.980 --> 03:21:34.615
WERE A LOT OF AYE SINCE THEIR

03:21:34.682 --> 03:21:36.217
GENERALLY HERE'S ANY ITEMS THAT

03:21:36.284 --> 03:21:38.486
WERE COMPOSED AS NEW EXTENSIONS

03:21:38.553 --> 03:21:41.989
IN JANUARY- WERE MOSTLY WHAT'S

03:21:42.056 --> 03:21:43.357
WRONG AND NOT INCLUDED- BECAUSE

03:21:43.424 --> 03:21:46.260
THOSE WERE NOT A SIGN BUDGET ON

03:21:46.327 --> 03:21:50.932
THE TWENTY NINETEEN. BUT WHEN

03:21:50.998 --> 03:21:53.534
IT COMES TO THAT BASED. IN ON.

03:21:53.601 --> 03:21:55.336
ITEMS TWENTY NINETY BUDGET I.

03:21:55.403 --> 03:21:56.504
MIGHT THE LCS FOR WHITE BASED

03:21:56.571 --> 03:21:58.506
ON FUNDING THAT WE- TO YOU SEE.

03:21:58.573 --> 03:22:02.877
YES YEAR DOES CUTS. ACTUALLY TO

03:22:02.944 --> 03:22:03.711
MAKE BECAUSE THERE WERE A BACK

03:22:03.778 --> 03:22:05.947
EVEN WASN'T NINE. NOT TO WHAT

03:22:06.013 --> 03:22:07.982
WE ARE TO X. TWENTY. DOES WERE

03:22:08.049 --> 03:22:09.150
GENERALLY THE ITEMS THAT

03:22:09.217 --> 03:22:10.785
WORKPLACE IN THE TRACKER AND

03:22:10.852 --> 03:22:11.752
THE SECOND POINT IS YOU ARE

03:22:11.819 --> 03:22:14.222
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT. IF NOT

03:22:14.288 --> 03:22:15.590
MOST OF THE ITEMS IN THE

03:22:15.656 --> 03:22:17.124
TRAILERS ARE ONGOING

03:22:17.191 --> 03:22:18.826
EXPENDITURES SO IT IS THE CASE

03:22:18.893 --> 03:22:20.161
AND WE'RE VERY COGNIZANT UP

03:22:20.228 --> 03:22:22.163
THIS THAT EVEN IF FEDERAL

03:22:22.230 --> 03:22:24.832
FUNDING ARRIVES IN THE AMOUNT

03:22:24.899 --> 03:22:26.534
OF FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS

03:22:26.601 --> 03:22:28.035
WOULD TRIGGER OFFICE. FOR THE

03:22:28.102 --> 03:22:30.071
BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWENTY DASH

03:22:30.137 --> 03:22:31.506
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT WE WOULD

03:22:31.572 --> 03:22:33.040
STILL NEED TO FIND WAYS TO ON

03:22:33.107 --> 03:22:35.076
THOSE EXPENDITURES IN THE YEARS

03:22:35.142 --> 03:22:36.777
AFTER THAT WHEN WE ARE FACING

03:22:36.844 --> 03:22:38.312
STRUCTURAL DEFICITS AND THAT'S

03:22:38.379 --> 03:22:40.615
ONE REASON WHY. WHEN WE ARE

03:22:40.681 --> 03:22:42.183
TALKING ABOUT ARE ASK FEDERAL

03:22:42.250 --> 03:22:44.819
GOVERNMENT'S WE'RE NOT ASKING

03:22:45.620 --> 03:22:47.221
FOR ASKING FOR SIGNIFICANTLY

03:22:47.288 --> 03:22:53.060
MORE. BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT.

03:22:53.127 --> 03:22:53.694
IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO EVER. ONE

03:22:53.761 --> 03:22:55.596
OF ON GOING BASS. BECAUSE IS MY

RECOVER. WHEN IT COMES IS

03:23:01.068 --> 03:23:04.205
TYPICALLY TO. THAT SERVICE.

03:23:04.272 --> 03:23:05.339
RATE REDUCTIONS YOU TURN IT

03:23:05.406 --> 03:23:07.141
OVER TO GRANT AT STOCK OF HOW.

03:23:07.208 --> 03:23:10.211
THE THOUGHT ABOUT THOSE THAT

03:23:10.278 --> 03:23:11.712
CUT IN ANY AREA WICKS IS

03:23:11.779 --> 03:23:18.719
PAINFUL AS WE WERE. THIS YEAH

03:23:18.786 --> 03:23:24.425
EARLY. EMPTY THIS IS THE

03:23:24.492 --> 03:23:25.760
