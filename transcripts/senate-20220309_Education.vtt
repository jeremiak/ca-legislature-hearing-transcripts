THEY CANNOT EXPRESS THEIR

DISTRICTS HAVE NO WAY TO

01:26:31.252 --> 01:26:33.588
ON IN OUR DISTRICT. I DIDN'T

01:26:33.655 --> 01:26:34.489
KNOW WHAT EVENTS WERE BEING

01:26:34.556 --> 01:26:36.157
DISCUSSED OR HOW THEY'RE BEING

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:39.394
DECIDED. I SIMPLY DIDN'T KNOW

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:40.762
WHERE TO LOOK. SINCE LIKE ME

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:42.063
COULD NOT MAKE INFORMED

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:43.731
DECISIONS COMPETENTLY PERCENT

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:46.834
OUR IDEAS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:47.969
THIS CRUCIAL KNOWLEDGE. BY

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.671
CHANCE I FOUND ABOUT SABLE

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:52.674
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY PROVIDE.

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.576
AND SINCE THEN I REALIZE HOW I

01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:56.511
CAN USE MY VOICE AS A STUDENTS

01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:58.479
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AFTER

01:26:58.546 --> 01:26:59.847
GETTING MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MY

01:26:59.914 --> 01:27:02.116
DISTRICT AND EDUCATION SYSTEM I

01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:04.519
STARTED TO SEE MY SCHOOL FROM A

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:06.187
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. HOWEVER I

01:27:06.254 --> 01:27:08.222
KNOW THAT MOST OF MY PEERS

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:10.124
CANNOT SEE THE SAME. RESEARCH

MORE LIKELY TO BE ACADEMICALLY

01:27:20.234 --> 01:27:23.404
MOTIVATED. STUDENTS WHO DO NOT

01:27:23.471 --> 01:27:24.472
BELIEVE THEY HAVE A VOICE.

01:27:24.539 --> 01:27:25.506
SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THE

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:27.275
RESPONSIBILITY TO GIVE STUDENTS

01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:29.510
THE SPACE TO USE THEIR VOICES BY

OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THOSE SO

01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:14.789
THEREFORE BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:16.057
KNOW HOW TO MAKE A CHANGE

01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:17.692
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TRY TO MAKE

01:33:17.758 --> 01:33:19.627

SCHOOL I DON'T HAVE SCHOOL AGED

01:43:05.812 --> 01:43:07.648
CHILDREN BUT TO HEAR FROM YOU

01:43:07.714 --> 01:43:09.716

01:43:09.783 --> 01:43:11.251
SCHOOLS- BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST SO

01:43:11.318 --> 01:43:12.152

01:43:14.922 --> 01:43:16.623
LOVE THIS IDEA BEFORE I ASK MY

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:18.492

STUDENTS AND JUST IN CALIFORNIA

01:43:39.813 --> 01:43:41.181
IN GENERAL I THINK IT'S ONE OF

01:43:41.248 --> 01:43:42.516
THE UNDERLYING COMMON THEMES

01:43:42.583 --> 01:43:44.685
THAT I'VE HEARD ACROSS THE

01:43:44.751 --> 01:43:48.889

TO ONE OF THE REASONS ACTUALLY

01:44:16.817 --> 01:44:18.051
THAT I RAN FOR OFFICE- WAS

01:44:18.118 --> 01:44:19.486

01:49:44.210 --> 01:49:46.379
FOOD CHER TABLES IN CAFETERIAS

01:49:46.446 --> 01:49:49.516
TO REDUCE FOOD WASTE. WHEN I

01:49:49.582 --> 01:49:51.551
WALK INTO SCHOOL I SEE GARBAGE

01:49:51.618 --> 01:49:53.353
CANS OVERFLOWING WITH PLASTIC

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:56.823
BOTTLES JUICE CARTONS AND PAPER.

01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:59.225
ALL RECYCLABLE ITEMS. WITH THE

01:49:59.292 --> 01:50:00.860
AMOUNT OF SINGLE USE RECYCLED

01:50:00.927 --> 01:50:03.263
MATERIALS THAT WE PRODUCE AS A

01:50:03.330 --> 01:50:04.497
SCHOOL WE SHOULD HAVE RECYCLING

01:50:04.564 --> 01:50:06.333
BINS SPREAD OUT ACROSS EVERY

01:50:06.399 --> 01:50:08.401
CORNER OF OUR CAMPUS. NONE THE

01:50:08.468 --> 01:50:11.471
LESS I SEE NO COMPOST BINS AND

01:50:11.538 --> 01:50:12.806
FEW RECYCLING BINS WHICH GO

01:50:12.872 --> 01:50:15.008
IGNORED BECAUSE STUDENTS DON'T

01:50:15.075 --> 01:50:16.176
KNOW WHAT CAN AND CANNOT BE

01:50:16.242 --> 01:50:18.778
RECYCLED. WHEN SCHOOLS DO NOT

01:50:18.845 --> 01:50:20.246
ACTIVELY PUSH FOR STUDENTS TO

01:50:20.313 --> 01:50:21.448
PRACTICE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:50:21.514 --> 01:50:23.116
SUSTAINABILITY THEY ARE BEING

01:50:23.183 --> 01:50:24.317
COMPLACENT ABOUT THE CLIMATE

01:50:24.384 --> 01:50:26.886
CRISIS. THE LACK OF

01:50:26.953 --> 01:50:28.088
ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE

01:50:28.154 --> 01:50:30.323
PRACTICES THAT MY SCHOOL AND

01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:31.224
MANY SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA

01:50:31.291 --> 01:50:33.159
EMPLOYEE MAKE ME EXTREMELY

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:35.228
CONCERNED FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR

01:50:35.295 --> 01:50:38.298
EARTH. LUCKILY THERE IS A

01:50:38.365 --> 01:50:39.532
SOLUTION. BY RECYCLING AND

01:50:39.599 --> 01:50:41.568
COMPOSTING WE CAN SLOW DOWN

01:50:41.634 --> 01:50:43.570
POLLUTION PREVENT OVERFLOWING

01:50:43.636 --> 01:50:46.139
LANDFILLS AND LESSEN OUR IMPACTS

01:50:46.206 --> 01:50:49.009
ON NATURAL HABITATS. IN ADDITION

01:50:49.075 --> 01:50:50.543
EXPOSING STUDENTS TO GOOD

01:50:50.610 --> 01:50:51.845
RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING

01:50:51.911 --> 01:50:53.980
PRACTICES WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO

01:50:54.047 --> 01:50:56.049
IMPLEMENT BACK THEM BACK HOME

01:50:56.116 --> 01:50:58.218
AND ELSEWHERE. PROVIDING

01:50:58.284 --> 01:50:59.953
STUDENTS WITH THE ABILITY TO

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:01.955
RECYCLE AND COMPOST AT SCHOOL IS

01:51:02.022 --> 01:51:03.656
IMPERATIVE FOR THE WELLNESS OF

01:51:03.723 --> 01:51:06.626
OURSELVES AND OUR WORLD. SCHOOLS

01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:08.361
GENERATE OVER HALF A MILLION

01:51:08.428 --> 01:51:10.130
TONS OF WASTE EACH YEAR IN

01:51:10.196 --> 01:51:11.698
CALIFORNIA CONTRIBUTING

01:51:11.765 --> 01:51:13.933
SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE BUILD UP IN

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.902
OUR LIMITED LANDFILL SPACE.

01:51:15.969 --> 01:51:17.637
NEARLY HALF OF SCHOOL WASTE IS

01:51:17.704 --> 01:51:19.672
RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE

01:51:19.739 --> 01:51:22.442
CARDBOARD PLASTIC BOTTLES FOOD

01:51:22.509 --> 01:51:23.777
BUT THE LACK OF RECYCLING AND

01:51:23.843 --> 01:51:25.612
COMPOSTING BINS LEAVE STUDENTS

01:51:25.678 --> 01:51:26.880
NO OPTION BUT TO THROW AWAY

01:51:26.946 --> 01:51:28.615
THESE MATERIALS AND GENERAL

01:51:28.681 --> 01:51:30.784
GARBAGE BINS. EVEN STUDENTS WERE

01:51:30.850 --> 01:51:32.519
OFFERED THE ABILITY TO RECYCLE

01:51:32.585 --> 01:51:35.488
AND COMPOST AT SCHOOL MAY LACK

01:51:35.555 --> 01:51:36.689
THE KNOWLEDGE ON HOW TO PROPERLY

01:51:36.756 --> 01:51:38.992
DO SO. IN LIGHT OF THESE

01:51:39.059 --> 01:51:41.161
OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIENCES MY

01:51:41.227 --> 01:51:42.695

AGREEMENTS WITH LOCAL RECYCLING

01:52:10.323 --> 01:52:11.991

AGREEMENTS WITH VENDORS TO

01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:19.199
PROVIDE BINS AND MANAGE WASTE.

01:52:19.265 --> 01:52:20.567

FOR RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING

01:52:33.613 --> 01:52:35.849
SERVICES. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN

01:52:35.915 --> 01:52:37.517
MULTIPLE DISTRICTS PUSH FORWARD

01:52:37.584 --> 01:52:39.652
SO MUCH SIMILAR PLANS. THE SAN

01:52:39.719 --> 01:52:41.154
DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:52:41.221 --> 01:52:43.189

THEIR UNWANTED FOOD ITEMS ON.

01:53:09.015 --> 01:53:10.650
OTHER STUDENTS CAN THEN TAKE THE

01:53:10.717 --> 01:53:12.252
ITEMS ON THIS TREE OR HAVE THE

AMOUNT OF FOOD WASTE GENERATED.

01:53:16.356 --> 01:53:17.490
SCHOOL DISTRICTS COULD MODEL

AMONG ITS THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND

01:53:28.501 --> 01:53:30.069
STUDENTS. BY IMPLEMENTING THIS

01:53:30.136 --> 01:53:32.071
PRACTICE STUDENTS WILL LEARN HOW

01:53:32.138 --> 01:53:33.806
TO RECYCLE AND COMPOST AND

01:53:33.873 --> 01:53:35.175

AND KNOW THAT THEIR SCHOOLS WERE

01:54:02.635 --> 01:54:04.437

02:02:58.404 --> 02:03:00.239
SO I THINK YOU MAKE AN EXCELLENT

02:03:00.306 --> 02:03:01.674
CASE ABOUT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT I

02:03:01.741 --> 02:03:03.309
AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU

02:03:03.375 --> 02:03:03.876
PRESENTED- I THINK THIS IS A

02:03:03.943 --> 02:03:06.345
GOOD IDEA. I AM JUST INTERESTED

02:03:06.412 --> 02:03:07.179
AND THINKING ABOUT HAVE YOU

02:03:07.246 --> 02:03:09.014
THOUGHT ABOUT HOW DO YOU BETTER

02:03:09.081 --> 02:03:11.517
ENGAGE STUDENTS- SO. GREAT WILL

02:03:11.584 --> 02:03:13.586
DO A PRESENTATION AND- HOW DO WE

02:03:13.652 --> 02:03:15.654
ENGAGE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY- IN A

02:03:15.721 --> 02:03:18.724
WAY THAT IT'S- THAT THEY SEE HOW

02:03:18.791 --> 02:03:21.193
IMPORTANT IT IS TO THEM AND DO

02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:22.862
IN A WAY THAT'S INTERACTIVE AND-

02:03:22.928 --> 02:03:24.096
AND REALLY ENGAGES THE PEOPLE

02:03:24.163 --> 02:03:25.698
WHO ARE THERE. BECAUSE I'M SURE

02:03:25.765 --> 02:03:26.999
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF PRESENTATIONS

02:03:27.066 --> 02:03:28.868
HE SAID THROUGH AN CLASS WHERE

02:03:28.934 --> 02:03:29.769
YOU'RE LIKE OKAY WELL THAT'S

02:03:29.835 --> 02:03:31.837
NICE AND- BUT I DON'T SEE HOW

02:03:31.904 --> 02:03:33.973
CONNECTS TO ME HOW GREAT SO- AND

02:03:34.039 --> 02:03:34.840
THEN MAYBE YOU'RE OUT REALLY

02:03:34.907 --> 02:03:35.875
GOOD STUDENTS IS A WELL ANYWAY

02:03:35.941 --> 02:03:37.710
I'M GONNA REALLY PAY ATTENTION

02:03:37.777 --> 02:03:38.744
BUT- YOU ALSO HAVE CLASSMATES

02:03:38.811 --> 02:03:40.346
WHO ARE LIKE IT DOESN'T MAKE

02:03:40.412 --> 02:03:41.881
SENSE TO ME- IT DOESN'T SEEM

02:03:41.947 --> 02:03:43.215
LIKE IT'S CONNECTED TO MY LIFE.

02:03:43.282 --> 02:03:46.752
I HAVE OTHER THINGS TO WORRY

02:03:46.819 --> 02:03:47.286
ABOUT THEY'RE NOT PAYING

02:03:47.353 --> 02:03:49.488
ATTENTION. BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH

02:03:49.555 --> 02:03:50.122
FOR THE QUESTION AND I'M REALLY.

02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:52.291
TO HEAR THAT YOU DISTRICT HAS

02:03:52.358 --> 02:03:52.925
INVESTED IN FINANCIAL LITERACY.

02:03:52.992 --> 02:03:54.593
SO I THINK. THERE IS THIS

02:03:54.660 --> 02:03:55.728
GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT THERE IS

02:03:55.795 --> 02:03:57.563
APATHY IN SCHOOL WELL ESPECIALLY

02:03:57.630 --> 02:03:58.964
WHEN YOU. TOOK A TAKE A LOOK AT

02:03:59.031 --> 02:04:00.232
SUBJECTS LIKE MATH PEOPLE SAY

02:04:00.299 --> 02:04:02.201
ONE OF MY GOING TO USE THIS IN

02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:03.769
THE REAL LIFE. BUT I THINK

02:04:03.836 --> 02:04:05.437
FINANCIAL LITERACY IS A LITTLE

02:04:05.504 --> 02:04:06.305
DIFFERENT BECAUSE- IT INHERENTLY

02:04:06.372 --> 02:04:09.074
APPLIES TO ALL OF US- AND THE

02:04:09.141 --> 02:04:12.278
SECOND PROBLEM. I THINK. IS LACK

02:04:12.344 --> 02:04:13.279
OF ACCESSIBILITY RIGHT NOW

02:04:13.345 --> 02:04:15.047
BECAUSE- ALTHOUGH A LOT OF

02:04:15.114 --> 02:04:16.615
SCHOOLS OFFER ECONOMICS CLASSES

02:04:16.682 --> 02:04:18.784
DOES NOT THE SAME AS FINANCIAL

02:04:18.851 --> 02:04:19.919
LITERACY. I THINK WE CAN ALL

02:04:19.985 --> 02:04:22.555
AGREE ON THAT. BUT MANY STUDENTS

02:04:22.621 --> 02:04:23.255
AT MY SCHOOL FOR EXAMPLE DON'T

02:04:23.322 --> 02:04:26.125
HAVE. ACCESS TO THOSE RESOURCES

02:04:26.192 --> 02:04:27.092
RIGHT THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO

02:04:27.159 --> 02:04:28.460
SEARCH THEY DON'T HAVE. PEOPLE

02:04:28.527 --> 02:04:29.562
TELLING THEM HERE'S WHERE YOU

02:04:29.628 --> 02:04:30.896
CAN LOOK. TO BECOME MORE

02:04:30.963 --> 02:04:32.531
FINANCIALLY LITERATE. AND

02:04:32.598 --> 02:04:33.999
ESPECIALLY AS MANY OF THEM ARE

02:04:34.066 --> 02:04:35.067
LOOKING TO TAKE ON STUDENT

02:04:35.134 --> 02:04:36.702
LOANS. AND DIDN'T YOU KNOW BY

02:04:36.769 --> 02:04:38.437
YOU GET CREDIT CARDS AND TAKE

02:04:38.504 --> 02:04:40.339
COMPLEX FINANCIAL DECISIONS. I

02:04:40.406 --> 02:04:42.474
THINK. IT WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL

02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:44.577
FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE

02:04:44.643 --> 02:04:45.344
INTRODUCTORY. COURSE TO

02:04:45.411 --> 02:04:47.246
FINANCIAL LITERACY TO. SHOW THEM

02:04:47.313 --> 02:04:49.048
WHERE THE RESOURCES ARE BECAUSE-

02:04:49.114 --> 02:04:50.482
I DON'T THINK THAT THE SAME

02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:52.451
LEVEL OF APATHY IS THERE FOR

02:04:52.518 --> 02:04:54.720
FINANCIAL LITERACY. I THINK-

02:04:54.787 --> 02:04:56.422
PROVIDING ACCESSIBILITY FOR

02:04:56.488 --> 02:04:58.724
THESE COURSES. IS GOING TO BE

02:04:58.791 --> 02:05:00.292
VERY HELPFUL ESPECIALLY TO THE

02:05:00.359 --> 02:05:02.127
STUDENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED- AND

02:05:02.194 --> 02:05:04.296
THEN I THINK THE PART ABOUT

02:05:04.363 --> 02:05:09.435
ENGAGEMENT- WHAT WHEN WE MAKE

02:05:09.501 --> 02:05:11.203
DE. THE COURSE. BUT WHEN WE MAKE

02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:12.271
IT TAILORED TO THE STUDENTS

02:05:12.338 --> 02:05:12.972
THEMSELVES I THINK WILL

02:05:13.038 --> 02:05:14.240
NATURALLY FEEL MORE INCLINED TO

02:05:14.306 --> 02:05:17.610
BE ENGAGED BECAUSE- IT REFLECTS.

02:05:17.676 --> 02:05:20.579
HOW THEY'LL DO LATER ON IN LIFE

02:05:20.646 --> 02:05:23.048
. SO I ALSO LOVE THIS IDEA I

02:05:23.115 --> 02:05:25.217
THINK THAT FINANCIAL LITERACY IS

02:05:25.284 --> 02:05:27.019
JUST OF THE MOST CRITICAL

02:05:27.086 --> 02:05:30.122
IMPORTANCE- WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL

02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:32.157
BACK IN THE DARK AGES WE HAD AN

02:05:32.224 --> 02:05:34.693
ECONOMICS CLASS. AND IN THAT

02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:36.762
ECONOMICS CLASS OUR INSTRUCTOR I

02:05:36.829 --> 02:05:38.697
STILL REMEMBER SHE TAUGHT US HOW

02:05:38.764 --> 02:05:40.099
TO DO SOMETHING WHICH I'M SURE

02:05:40.165 --> 02:05:42.268
NONE OF YOU KNOW HOW TO DO WHICH

02:05:42.334 --> 02:05:44.069
IS TO WRITE A CHECK- AND HOW TO

02:05:44.136 --> 02:05:45.804
PAY YOUR BILLS. AND WE TALKED

02:05:45.871 --> 02:05:48.140
ABOUT- YOU KNOW RENT AND WAGES

02:05:48.207 --> 02:05:50.209
AND IF YOU MAKE THIS MUCH WHAT

02:05:50.276 --> 02:05:52.278
CAN YOU AFFORD AND I DO THINK

02:05:52.344 --> 02:05:54.446
THAT THAT IS LACKING- BEFORE THE

02:05:54.513 --> 02:05:56.148
PANDEMIC ON TEAM NAY BUT WE

02:05:56.215 --> 02:05:58.284
WOULD ALWAYS HAVE A YOUNG

02:05:58.350 --> 02:05:59.351
WOMEN'S AND A YOUNG MEN'S

02:05:59.418 --> 02:06:01.186
CONFERENCE. EACH YEAR AT OUR-

02:06:01.253 --> 02:06:02.855
LAST I BELIEVE IS OUR LAST TEN

02:06:02.922 --> 02:06:03.923
MINS CONFERENCE BEFORE THE

02:06:03.989 --> 02:06:05.858
PANDEMIC WE HAD ABOUT. A LITTLE

02:06:05.925 --> 02:06:07.993
OVER TWO HUNDRED YOUNG MEN THAT

02:06:08.060 --> 02:06:09.161
WE DID SOMETHING CALLED MAD CITY

02:06:09.228 --> 02:06:11.196
MONEY AND IT WAS PUT ON AND I

02:06:11.263 --> 02:06:13.332
THINK THIS WOULD BE- GREAT IN

02:06:13.399 --> 02:06:14.700
ALL OF OUR HIGH SCHOOLS AND EVEN

02:06:14.767 --> 02:06:16.802
IN OUR JUNIOR HIGHS- IS PUT ON

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:20.239
BY A- CREDIT UNION. AND SO THE

02:06:20.306 --> 02:06:21.006
YOUNG MEN WERE PAIRED UP AND

02:06:21.073 --> 02:06:22.875
THEY WERE A COUPLE THAT WERE

02:06:22.942 --> 02:06:25.611
EACH GIVEN A PROFESSION AND HOW

02:06:25.678 --> 02:06:27.146
MUCH THEY MADE IT THAT

02:06:27.212 --> 02:06:28.580
PROFESSION THEY WERE GIVEN- SOME

02:06:28.647 --> 02:06:29.882
HAD CHILDREN SOME DID NOT HAVE

02:06:29.949 --> 02:06:31.984
CHILDREN. AND THEN THEY WERE

02:06:32.051 --> 02:06:34.687
TOLD THAT THEY HAD NINE ARE

02:06:34.753 --> 02:06:36.188
ELEVEN DIFFERENT SPOTS TO GO TO

02:06:36.255 --> 02:06:38.157
AND THEY HAD THREE CHOICES OF

02:06:38.223 --> 02:06:39.658
HOW MUCH RENT THEY WANT TO PAY

02:06:39.725 --> 02:06:41.160
WHAT KIND OF CAR THEY WANT TO

02:06:41.226 --> 02:06:43.028
DRIVE OR DO THEY WANT TO TAKE A

02:06:43.095 --> 02:06:45.097
BUS TO SAVE MONEY- HOW MUCH IS

02:06:45.164 --> 02:06:46.966
SPENT. ON FOOD HOW MUCH CHILD

02:06:47.032 --> 02:06:48.667
CARE WAS IT WAS ABSOLUTELY

02:06:48.734 --> 02:06:50.636
AMAZING AND I WAS WORRIED TO

02:06:50.703 --> 02:06:52.271
DOCTOR PANTS FOR A POINT THAT

02:06:52.338 --> 02:06:53.772
THESE YOUNG MEN MIGHT NOT FIND

02:06:53.839 --> 02:06:55.908
IT ENGAING BUT THEY ALL DID A

02:06:55.975 --> 02:06:58.177
PHENOMENAL JOB AND I WANT ONE OF

02:06:58.243 --> 02:07:00.045
THE- THAT THE TWO THAT WERE

02:07:00.112 --> 02:07:01.613
PAIRED UP THEY CAME OVER AND

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:04.383
SAID. OKAY WHERE DO WE GO FOR

02:07:04.450 --> 02:07:04.917
COUNSELLING BECAUSE WE'RE

02:07:04.984 --> 02:07:05.584
FIGHTING AND- AND I THOUGHT THAT

02:07:05.651 --> 02:07:07.252
WAS GREAT AND VERY ACCURATE WHAT

02:07:07.319 --> 02:07:09.955
HAPPENS IN LIFE SO I DO REALLY

02:07:10.022 --> 02:07:11.523
THINK THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE

02:07:11.590 --> 02:07:13.759
SOMETHING OUT- AND I DON'T KNOW

02:07:13.826 --> 02:07:16.161
IF THIS ISN'T THE END OF THIS

02:07:16.228 --> 02:07:17.062
PARTICULAR CREDIT UNION WOULD DO

02:07:17.129 --> 02:07:20.466
IT. ANYWHERE BUT- LET ME NOODLE

02:07:20.532 --> 02:07:21.066
ON THAT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I

02:07:21.133 --> 02:07:23.335
COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU. YOU

02:07:23.402 --> 02:07:24.003
KNOW YOU YOU'RE GROWING UP AND-

02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:26.171
YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE A ROOF OVER

02:07:26.238 --> 02:07:28.107
YOUR HEAD SO. HOPEFULLY AND YOU

02:07:28.173 --> 02:07:29.174
HAVE FOOD ON THE TABLE AND A LOT

02:07:29.241 --> 02:07:30.709
OF TIMES ON YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T

02:07:30.776 --> 02:07:32.611
KNOW. WHAT THE COST OF THAT IS

02:07:32.678 --> 02:07:33.912
THE COST OF KEEPING THE LIGHTS

02:07:33.979 --> 02:07:35.748
ON- THAT A MINIMUM WAGE JOB AT

02:07:35.814 --> 02:07:36.949
FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR IS

02:07:37.016 --> 02:07:38.784
ACTUALLY A POVERTY WAGE JOBS- SO

02:07:38.851 --> 02:07:40.252
I THINK THIS IS JUST CRITICALLY

02:07:40.319 --> 02:07:41.954
IMPORTANT AS WELL SO I. THANK

02:07:42.021 --> 02:07:43.088

02:07:43.155 --> 02:07:45.391

ASSEMBLY. THAT ADDRESS THIS AND

02:07:49.795 --> 02:07:51.563

SOMETHING- WITH THIS MAD CITY

02:07:57.836 --> 02:08:00.172
MONEY. PROGRAM I THINK THAT IT

02:08:00.239 --> 02:08:02.007
WOULD- WE DID WITH OUR YOUNG MEN

02:08:02.074 --> 02:08:02.908
BUT OBVIOUSLY WE WANT OUR YOUNG

02:08:02.975 --> 02:08:04.743
WOMEN TO BENEFIT FROM THAT TOO

02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:06.245

WITH MY PEERS I WAS SHOCKED TO

02:09:00.866 --> 02:09:02.334
LEARN THAT OTHER STUDENTS SHARE

02:09:02.401 --> 02:09:04.670
THE SAME FEELINGS OF EASE THAT I

02:09:04.736 --> 02:09:06.605
WAS EXPERIENCING CONCERNING MY

02:09:21.854 --> 02:09:24.156
HOPELESS BECAUSE MY SCHOOL'S

02:09:24.223 --> 02:09:26.058
FACULTY HAVE NOT TAKEN PROPER

02:09:26.125 --> 02:09:28.760
SAFETY MEASURES TO COMBAT THESE

02:09:28.827 --> 02:09:30.929
DANGERS. MANY STUDENTS LIKE

02:09:30.996 --> 02:09:33.732
MYSELF NOW DO NOT FEEL SAFE

02:09:33.799 --> 02:09:35.834
GOING TO SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THIS

02:09:35.901 --> 02:09:37.569
. SIMILARLY A CUPERTINO HIGH

02:09:37.636 --> 02:09:39.238
SCHOOL AND HOMES AT HIGH SCHOOL

02:09:39.304 --> 02:09:41.240
IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY THERE HAS

02:09:41.306 --> 02:09:43.442
BEEN A BOMB THREAT IN SEVERAL

02:09:43.509 --> 02:09:45.310
INSTANCES OF STUDENTS BRINGING

02:09:45.377 --> 02:09:48.247
GUNS ON CAMPUS. AT WEST VALLEY

02:09:48.313 --> 02:09:49.915
HIGH SCHOOL IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY

02:09:49.982 --> 02:09:52.050
STUDENT FIGHTS NEAR CAMPUS HAVE

02:09:52.117 --> 02:09:54.887
ESCALATED INTO SHOOTINGS THAT

02:09:54.953 --> 02:09:55.954
CAUSED THE SCHOOL TO GO ON

02:09:56.021 --> 02:09:58.023
LOCKDOWN. SCHOOL A PLACE THAT

02:09:58.090 --> 02:09:59.958
SHE FOSTER STUDENT DEVELOPMENT

02:10:00.025 --> 02:10:01.793
AND LEARNING THIS SAFE AND

02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:04.096
PROTECTED ENVIRONMENT HAS BECOME

02:10:04.163 --> 02:10:06.465
A PLACE OF FEAR FOR STUDENTS

02:10:06.532 --> 02:10:07.766
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A

02:10:07.833 --> 02:10:10.836
PLATFORM TO VOICE THEIR SAFETY

02:10:10.903 --> 02:10:12.804
CONCERNS. IT IS APPARENT THAT TO

02:10:12.871 --> 02:10:15.507
A LOT OF STUDENT REPRESENTATION

02:10:15.574 --> 02:10:16.041
IN SETTING SCHOOL SAFETY

02:10:16.108 --> 02:10:18.043
GUIDELINES THE CURRENT SCHOOL

02:10:18.110 --> 02:10:19.711
SAFETY GUIDELINES DO NOT

02:10:19.778 --> 02:10:21.180
ADEQUATELY REPRESENT STUDENT

02:10:21.246 --> 02:10:25.817
NEEDS. CALIFORNIA REQUIRES EVERY

02:10:25.884 --> 02:10:27.452
PUBLIC SCHOOL TO CREATE A

02:10:27.519 --> 02:10:29.087

EDUCATION PARTNERS OF THE SCHOOL

02:10:36.562 --> 02:10:37.696
COMMUNITY. HOWEVER THESE PENS

02:10:37.763 --> 02:10:39.731
RARELY INCLUDE STUDENT INPUT AND

02:10:39.798 --> 02:10:41.867
FAIL TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE

02:10:41.934 --> 02:10:43.936
NEEDS OF STUDENTS. INSTEAD THEY

02:10:44.002 --> 02:10:45.971
ADDRESS ADULTS PERCEIVED THREATS

02:10:46.038 --> 02:10:48.140
TO SCHOOL SAFETY. THEREFORE WE

02:10:48.207 --> 02:10:49.975
NEED MORE STUDENT REPRESENTATION

02:10:50.042 --> 02:10:51.610

02:10:51.677 --> 02:10:53.679
OUR SCHOOL SAFETY GUIDELINES. IN

02:10:53.745 --> 02:10:55.581
CALIFORNIA THE RISE OF VIOLENCE

02:10:55.647 --> 02:10:56.782
WITHIN SCHOOLS HAS CREATED A

02:10:56.848 --> 02:10:58.517

SEVERE THREATS TO THEIR PHYSICAL

02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:10.963

THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

02:13:45.684 --> 02:13:48.887
PRESENTATION AND- GOOD IT IS A

02:13:48.954 --> 02:13:51.757
FIRST OF ALL- DOWN THE DATA ON

02:13:51.823 --> 02:13:54.760
VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS- ACTUALLY I

02:13:54.826 --> 02:13:57.963
THINK- WAS PRETTY COVE IT WAS

02:13:58.029 --> 02:13:59.731
ACTUALLY I THINK- HEADING

02:13:59.798 --> 02:14:01.733
DOWNWARD BUT- WE DON'T REALLY

02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:03.769
HAVE GOOD DATA POST CODE- AND

02:14:03.835 --> 02:14:05.971
UNFORTUNATELY I MEAN IT IT

02:14:06.037 --> 02:14:07.239
ANECDOTALLY IT'S UP. AND IT

02:14:07.305 --> 02:14:09.274
SEEMS TO BE UP THIS OR RELATED

02:14:09.341 --> 02:14:10.842
TO ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY

02:14:10.909 --> 02:14:12.577
INCREASE VIOLENCE IN THE GENERAL

02:14:12.644 --> 02:14:14.846
COMMUNITY- AND- AND

02:14:14.913 --> 02:14:17.416
UNFORTUNATELY ALSO- SOMETIMES

02:14:17.482 --> 02:14:19.017
PARENTS DON'T MODEL THE PROGRAM

02:14:19.084 --> 02:14:20.519
BEHAVIOR WITH SCHOOL LEADERS

02:14:20.585 --> 02:14:21.953
WHAT IT SCHOOL BOARD SOURCE

02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:24.423
TEACHERS OR SCHOOL LEADERS AS

02:14:24.489 --> 02:14:25.690
WELL AND THAT OF COURSE

02:14:25.757 --> 02:14:28.393
PROBLEMS. SOME STUDENTS TEND TO

02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:30.328
IMITATE THOSE PARENTS AND THEN.

02:14:30.395 --> 02:14:31.396
ENGAGE AND WHETHER IT'S

02:14:31.463 --> 02:14:32.831
THREATENING BEHAVIOR VIOLENT

02:14:32.898 --> 02:14:34.499
BEHAVIOR SO I THINK THAT

02:14:34.566 --> 02:14:36.001
SOMETHING TO BE YOU KNOW THE

02:14:36.067 --> 02:14:37.769
FORTUNE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

02:14:37.836 --> 02:14:40.639
HOW TO DRESS AS WELL IT'S- IT'S

02:14:40.705 --> 02:14:41.807
NOT STUDENTS PARENTS THAT-

02:14:41.873 --> 02:14:43.442
THERE'S NOT SHOWING RESPECT TO

02:14:43.508 --> 02:14:44.709
THEIR SCHOOL LEADERS AND-

02:14:44.776 --> 02:14:46.478
ENGAGING IN. INAPPROPRIATE

02:14:46.545 --> 02:14:47.679
BEHAVIOR WE'RE SEEING MORE AND

02:14:47.746 --> 02:14:49.314
MORE CASES OF THAT AND INDEED

02:14:49.381 --> 02:14:51.483
FOR PUBLIC FORMS UNFORTUNATELY.

02:14:51.550 --> 02:14:54.019
I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO

02:14:54.085 --> 02:14:55.253
HAVE STUDENTS MUCH MORE ENGAGED

02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:57.088
AFTER ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:14:57.155 --> 02:14:58.790
SAFETY YOU KNOW IT'S A IT IS

02:14:58.857 --> 02:15:00.759
ABOUT STUDENTS ABOUT SPIT OUT

02:15:00.826 --> 02:15:01.927
THE TEACHERS AND STAFF BUT I

02:15:01.993 --> 02:15:03.762
MEAN STUDENTS ARE VERY MUCH PART

02:15:03.829 --> 02:15:06.097
OF THAT AND NEED TO BE ENGAGED

02:15:06.164 --> 02:15:07.899
IN HELPING DEVELOP SOLUTIONS.

02:15:07.966 --> 02:15:09.801
AND OFTEN TIMES- WITH SUITS

02:15:09.868 --> 02:15:11.136
SOLUTIONS BEING DEVELOPED

02:15:11.203 --> 02:15:12.804
WITHOUT THE HMO STUDENTS YOU CAN

02:15:12.871 --> 02:15:14.873
END UP WITH EVEN SOMETIMES YOU

02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:17.476
KNOW HARMFUL US- SOLUTION SO FOR

02:15:17.542 --> 02:15:20.245
EXAMPLE- CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND

02:15:20.312 --> 02:15:21.580
HIS CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:15:21.646 --> 02:15:23.748
POTENTIAL IT'S A- THE- GUN

02:15:23.815 --> 02:15:25.083
VIOLENCE INCIDENT AND THEN THE

02:15:25.150 --> 02:15:27.619
SCHOOL RIGHT. BUT THE ANSWER IS

02:15:27.686 --> 02:15:28.687
NOT NECESSARILY TO HAVE IT

02:15:28.753 --> 02:15:30.755
DRILLED WHERE UNFORTUNATELY ONE

02:15:30.822 --> 02:15:33.191
SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE DAY. HAD

02:15:33.258 --> 02:15:35.193
TEACHERS YOU KNOW THEY HAD TO

02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:37.062
JUST PRETEND LIKE THEY WERE SHOT

02:15:37.128 --> 02:15:39.197
BY PEOPLE I MEAN THAT THAT WAS

02:15:39.264 --> 02:15:40.065
REALLY TRAUMATIC FOR THE

02:15:40.131 --> 02:15:41.867
STUDENTS TO HAVE TO WITNESS

02:15:41.933 --> 02:15:44.436
THAT- IS BUSY PART OF THE DRILL

02:15:44.503 --> 02:15:52.777
RIGHT IT WAS- AND SO FORTH. AND

02:15:52.844 --> 02:15:53.812
I'M NOT SURE WHO WOULD THINK

02:15:53.879 --> 02:15:56.114
THAT WAS A ACTUALLY A GOOD IDEA-

02:15:56.181 --> 02:15:58.083
AND THAT AND THEN OF WE NEED TO

02:15:58.149 --> 02:16:00.085
BE SURE WE SHOULD THAT THAT THE-

02:16:00.151 --> 02:16:01.553
YEAH. ITS AT THE- PEOPLE ARE

02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:02.754
DEVELOPING THESE PLANS ARE TO

02:16:02.821 --> 02:16:03.688
THE STUDENTS. ALL RIGHT AT THE

02:16:03.755 --> 02:16:05.690
THEIR FEARS IT DIDN'T NOT JUST

02:16:05.757 --> 02:16:06.958
THE MAN ARE FEARS BUT WHAT THE

02:16:07.025 --> 02:16:09.194
ACTUALLY THE ACTUAL. ARE SO I

02:16:09.261 --> 02:16:10.795
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT- AND- I

02:16:10.862 --> 02:16:12.697
MEAN WE NEED TO HAVE GOOD DATA

02:16:12.764 --> 02:16:14.733
SO WE KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING

02:16:14.799 --> 02:16:16.034
ON AT BUT ALSO SAFETY IS

02:16:16.101 --> 02:16:17.068
PARTIALLY PERCEPTION TOO SO WE

02:16:17.135 --> 02:16:18.837
NEED TO BE SURE. PROBABLY

DEALING WITH PERCEPTION AND THEN

02:16:20.505 --> 02:16:22.207

STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOR FOR

02:16:23.909 --> 02:16:25.877

THE KIND OF THE THAT TYPE

02:16:41.793 --> 02:16:42.727
BEHAVIOR THAT'S GOING TO BE

02:16:42.794 --> 02:16:44.829

BECAUSE ABOUT. BEHAVIOR BEING

02:17:14.492 --> 02:17:17.295
MODELED- BY PARENTS NOT ALL

02:17:17.362 --> 02:17:19.130

PARENTS- PARADING AROUND YELLING

02:17:38.817 --> 02:17:40.552

02:17:43.288 --> 02:17:44.756
FOR THEM BECAUSE NO ONE HAS

02:17:44.823 --> 02:17:45.857
TAUGHT THEM IN THEIR LIFE THAT

02:17:45.924 --> 02:17:48.526

02:17:51.129 --> 02:17:52.697
WANT CHANGE BUT THERE'S AN

02:17:52.764 --> 02:17:54.366
APPROPRIATE WAY TO DO IT AND ALL
