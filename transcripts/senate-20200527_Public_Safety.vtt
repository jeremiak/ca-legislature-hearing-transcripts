APPROACH TO THE REGISTRY WAS A

00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:44.802
ONE SIZE FITS ALL IN WAS

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:47.171
INAPPROPRIATE AND SO WE CREATED

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:49.707

BUT IN UNDERSTANDING FROM A

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:14.398
VICTIM PERSPECTIVE WHAT. ONE

00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:15.933
GOAL OF WHAT WAS TRYING TO BE

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.569
ACCOMPLISHED WITH THIS LAW WAS

00:42:18.636 --> 00:42:21.105
TO PER TO PROTECT THE VICTIM

00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:22.273
AND NOT PUT A VICTIM IN THE

00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:24.174
SITUATION WHERE THE VICTIM HAS

00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:26.777
TO GO BACK TO CIVIL COURT TO

00:42:26.844 --> 00:42:29.046

TIER TYPE OF SEX OFFENSE AND SO

00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:39.390
WHAT THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED

00:42:39.456 --> 00:42:42.293
IS THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED SO

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:44.395
THAT THIS PERTAINS TO EVERYONE

00:42:44.461 --> 00:42:46.363
WHO FALLS IN THE TIER THREE AND

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:47.665
EFFECTIVE RONA FALLS IN THE

00:42:47.731 --> 00:42:49.967
TIER THREE. THERE'S A LITTLE

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:53.203
VARIATION BUT BASICALLY- DANTE

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:55.339
SOURCE NECK NERO'S THE CATEGORY

00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:58.409
OF OFFENSES AND NOW THERE ARE

00:42:58.475 --> 00:43:00.277
SOME WHO BELIEVE EVEN OUR

00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:01.679
AMENDMENT WOULD STILL BE

00:43:01.745 --> 00:43:04.615
UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE OF A

00:43:04.682 --> 00:43:06.283
POTENTIAL LACK OF JUDICIAL

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:13.157
REVIEW. THAT DO DAY AGAIN

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:15.392
THAT'S REALLY FOR THE COURTS TO

00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:18.529
DETERMINE- OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY

00:43:18.595 --> 00:43:20.998
STAFF WOULDN'T HAVE DRAFTED

00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:22.399
SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE

00:43:22.466 --> 00:43:24.001
COMPLETELY CLEAR WAS

00:43:24.068 --> 00:43:25.069
UNCONSTITUTIONAL IF YOU KNOW

00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:26.437
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY THEY

00:43:26.503 --> 00:43:28.772
WERE THEY WERE TRYING TO FOLLOW

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:31.442
THE- THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:33.243
WHAT IS ALLOWABLE AND TO

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:34.945
PROVIDE AN AMENDMENT THAT NEAR

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:37.181
ROAD AND YET STILL GAVE THOSE

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:40.818
VICTIMS. OF THOSE OUR WHAT WE

00:43:40.884 --> 00:43:42.753

OFFENSES THE TYPE THAT YOU GET

00:43:44.321 --> 00:43:45.389
A LIFE SENTENCE NO LIFE

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:46.957
SENTENCE DOESN'T MEAN YOU SPEND

00:43:47.024 --> 00:43:48.959
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IN PRISON. IT

00:43:49.026 --> 00:43:50.260
JUST MEANS THAT BEFORE YOU

00:43:50.327 --> 00:43:51.395
WOULD EVEN BE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:52.463
PAROLE YOU WOULD ALREADY HAVE

00:43:52.529 --> 00:43:54.131
BEEN IN PRISON FOR A GOOD

00:43:54.198 --> 00:43:56.333
NUMBER OF YEARS USUALLY MINIMUM

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.936
OF TWENTY. BUT THEN IF YOU ARE

00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:00.471
SUCCESSFUL ON PAROLE AND IF WE

00:44:00.537 --> 00:44:02.473
LOOK AT THE HISTORY. IT'S IS

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:03.974
THAT YOUR ABILITY TO BE

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:05.576
SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING PROLES

00:44:05.642 --> 00:44:07.945
PRETTY LOW. BUT LET'S SAY YOU

00:44:08.012 --> 00:44:11.782
ARE THAT AT THAT POINT. THE

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:13.117
TECH ALMOST PERMANENT

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:14.585
RESTRAINING ORDER WOULD BE PUT

00:44:14.651 --> 00:44:16.620
ON YOU. RATHER THAN THE FACT

00:44:16.687 --> 00:44:18.322
I'M HAVING TO GO BACK TO COURT

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:20.424
IN REQUESTING. SO THAT IS WHAT

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:22.693
WE WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.029
THE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU THANK

COURSE ICE I DESCRIBE THESE

00:44:40.511 --> 00:44:43.747
THINGS IN. COMMON VERNACULAR

00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:45.949

00:44:47.985 --> 00:44:49.119
SUPER CERTAIN GROUP OF SEX

OFFENDERS THAT HAVE LIFETIME

00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:52.890
PAROLE SO THIS WOULD THE

00:44:52.956 --> 00:44:54.491
AMENDMENT WOULD STRIKE UP THE

00:44:54.558 --> 00:44:56.760
CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE BAT IN

00:44:56.827 --> 00:44:58.595

RESTRAINING ORDER AS A

00:45:04.334 --> 00:45:06.503
CONDITION OF PAROLE. SO THERE'S

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:07.438
WE'VE ALREADY SELECTED THE

00:45:07.504 --> 00:45:09.373

WE NEVER WANT TO EVER DO WITH

THE PERPETRATOR AGAIN WE NEVER

NEVER WANT TO DO ANYTHING IN

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.997
RELATIONSHIP TO THE PERPETRATOR

00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:36.800
AGAIN. FOR LARGE HAVE TO

RESPECTING THE RIGHTS OF ALL

00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:57.554
CONCERNED IN CONSTRUCTING A LAW

00:45:57.621 --> 00:46:00.290
IT SEEMED LIKE IT. IT WITH

WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:03.494
OTHERS IT WAS I FELT THE

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.963
APPROPRIATE AMENDMENTS. NOW AND

00:46:06.029 --> 00:46:07.998
AGAIN I AM IN IN THE COMMON I'M

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:10.234
ABOUT TO MAKE I DO NOT MEAN TO

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.036
IMPLY IN ANY WAY THAT MS MENDEZ

00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:15.839
WHO SPOKE IS IN IT SHE SHE

00:46:15.906 --> 00:46:16.406
EXPERIENCE WHAT YOU

00:46:16.473 --> 00:46:18.175
EXPERIENCED. BUT IN WHAT SHE

00:46:18.242 --> 00:46:20.344
COMMUNICATED SHE INDICATED THAT

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:22.379
THAT WAS THE FAMILY MEMBERS. OF

00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:25.649
HER PERPETRATOR. AND EVEN IF WE

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:27.551
WERE TO PASS THE LAW AS

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:29.353
PRESENTED TO US RIGHT NOW

00:46:29.419 --> 00:46:31.288
WITHOUT THE MINUTE. HE WOULD

00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:33.524
ONLY BE A RESTRAINING ORDER ON

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:34.925
THE INDIVIDUAL ON THE

00:46:34.992 --> 00:46:36.960
PERPETRATOR AND NOT ON THE

00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:39.796
FAMILY MEMBERS SO IT WOULD NOT

00:46:39.863 --> 00:46:41.565
I MEAN IT IS HORRIBLE WHAT SHE

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:43.433
EXPERIENCED AND NO ONE SHOULD

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.002
HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THAT. BUT

00:46:45.068 --> 00:46:46.470
THIS LAW WOULD NOT HAVE

00:46:46.537 --> 00:46:49.106
PREVENTED THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:51.708
FROM DOING WHATEVER THEY DID.

00:46:51.775 --> 00:46:52.309
NOW LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY

00:46:52.376 --> 00:46:54.745
OTHER ON THE- I'M CENTER

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:56.480
JACKSON AND SENATOR WIENER YEAH

00:46:56.547 --> 00:46:58.515
I DIDN'T GET IT. I REMEMBER WAY

00:46:58.582 --> 00:47:00.551
BACK WHEN I WAS A YOUNG

00:47:00.617 --> 00:47:03.887
PROSECUTOR- YOU HAD-

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:05.355
INDIVIDUALS WHO FOR WHATEVER

00:47:05.422 --> 00:47:08.091
REASON URINATED IN PUBLIC AND

00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:09.793
HAD TO REGISTER AS SEX

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.361
OFFENDERS ALONG WITH PEOPLE WHO

00:47:11.428 --> 00:47:13.630
WERE TRUE. SEX OFFENDER SO I

00:47:13.697 --> 00:47:14.731
APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE

00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:16.800
RECOGNIZED THAT THERE NEEDS TO

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:20.537
BE- SOME DISTINCTION BETWEEN.

00:47:20.604 --> 00:47:22.372
THE OFFENSES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:26.076
CATEGORIZED AS A SEX OFFENSE.

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:29.413
REGISTRATION CRIMES- I THINK

00:47:29.479 --> 00:47:31.949
THE PROPOSAL THAT. YOU

00:47:32.015 --> 00:47:33.750
RECOMMEND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:36.186
THE BAD THE REALLY BAD PEOPLE.

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:37.854
AND THE FACT THAT THEY WILL

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:39.223
HAVE A LIFETIME THE PAROLE

00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:40.891
BOARDS OVER WHICH HAVE

00:47:40.958 --> 00:47:41.892
JURISDICTION OVER THEM

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:43.293
POTENTIALLY FOR THE COURSE OF

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.095
THEIR LIVES WE'LL BE ABLE TO

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:47.264
MAKE THAT DECISION. I ALSO

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:48.365
THINK WE NEED TO GIVE THE COURT

00:47:48.432 --> 00:47:50.734
SOME. DISCRETION IN HIS IS

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:52.502
WELL IF A PERSON NEEDS TO COME

00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:54.738
IN FOR WHATEVER REASON AFTER A

00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:59.376
TEN YEAR PERIOD- TO RENEW A-

00:47:59.443 --> 00:48:00.644
RESTRAINING ORDER IF YOU WILL I

00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.713
THINK THAT THAT IS OF AS I

00:48:02.779 --> 00:48:04.481
UNDERSTAND ALREADY AVAILABLE.

00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:07.251

FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE TO THE

00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:06.690
POINT WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:52:06.756 --> 00:52:09.159
CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT IN

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:11.461
TERMS OF IDENTIFYING WHO WERE

00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:13.129
THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY.

00:52:13.196 --> 00:52:15.565

SIXTY WHO STONE THE REGISTRY-

00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:23.974
AND THEN WE HAVE. STREAM AND OF

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:28.178
THE PREDATORS WHO WERE TALK

00:52:28.245 --> 00:52:29.913
JUST HORRIFIC HUMAN BEINGS.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:33.250
THERE'S A MASSIVE SPECTRUM

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:35.552
BETWEEN INCLUDING ANSWER TO. ON

00:52:35.619 --> 00:52:38.488

STILL NOT. PERFECT BUT IT WAS

00:52:43.426 --> 00:52:44.661

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:03.747
OF THE BILL NOW IS A THIS IS A

00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:05.148

AND OF COURSE IT IS A COMMITTEE

00:53:55.198 --> 00:53:57.200
STAFF OF FOR WORKING WITH MY

00:53:57.267 --> 00:53:59.269
TEAM AND MAKING SURE THAT WE

COLLEAGUES IN THE DíAS WOULD

00:54:35.305 --> 00:54:39.676
YEAR THE MORNING TO. REJECT

00:54:39.743 --> 00:54:42.912
THOSE VICTIMS FROM HAVING TO.

00:54:42.979 --> 00:54:44.247
BASICALLY HAVE TO GO BACK TO

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:45.949
COURT AGAIN AND AGAIN SINCE WE

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:49.786
KNOW THAT ALREADY DEAR IS THE

00:54:49.853 --> 00:54:51.454
SEXUAL CRIMES JUST IN AN OF

00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:53.023
THEIR NATURE PEOPLE REPORT THEM

00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:54.758
LESS JUST BECAUSE OF THE NOT

00:54:54.824 --> 00:54:55.992
EVEN WANTING TO GO THROUGH THE

00:54:56.059 --> 00:54:59.496
EXPERIENCE OF HAVING TO- REPORT

00:54:59.562 --> 00:55:03.633
N. B. I MEAN THIS. THE WHETHER

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.269
IT'S SHAME OR- WONDERING

00:55:06.336 --> 00:55:07.303
WHETHER YOU WOULD BE EVEN

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:08.938
CONSIDERED CREDIBLE SO WE KNOW

00:55:09.005 --> 00:55:11.141
THEY'RE ALL THOSE ELEMENTS BUT

00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:14.210
IN AS WE'VE DISCUSSED IN.

00:55:14.277 --> 00:55:17.380
TRYING TO CRAFT ANY STATUTE WE

00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:19.649
HAVE TO BALANCE ALL THE RIGHTS-

00:55:19.716 --> 00:55:25.588
SO I AM. I THINK WE ARE. WE

00:55:25.655 --> 00:55:27.357
CERTAINLY TRIED OUR BEST TO

00:55:27.424 --> 00:55:28.958
COME UP WITH AN AMENDMENT THAT

00:55:29.025 --> 00:55:31.594
WOULD ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT

00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:34.030
WERE EXPRESSED BY YOUR

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:36.499
ADVOCATES- IN YOUR BILL

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:39.302
SPONSORED- BUT I CAN SEE NOW

00:55:39.369 --> 00:55:41.504
THAT IT DOESN'T QUITE DO WHAT

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:43.406
YOU NEEDED TO DO BUT I THINK

00:55:43.473 --> 00:55:45.709
THE BILL SAY FIRST BEFORE AS

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:47.377

SECTION THREE NINETY SIX. AFTER

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:35.852
THE SAN FERNANDO EARTHQUAKE IN

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:36.452
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND OVER

01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:38.921

01:02:38.988 --> 01:02:41.390

BUT THE CURRENT EMERGENCY SHOWS

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:47.897
THAT WE NEED TO UPDATE THE LAW.

01:02:47.964 --> 01:02:49.565
THIS BILL PROVIDES TWO

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:51.434
IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS IT

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:52.835

INCLUDING PANDEMICS AND ALSO

01:02:59.175 --> 01:03:00.776
APPLIES THE LAW EQUALLY TO ALL

01:03:00.843 --> 01:03:04.113
SELLERS ONLINE SELLERS AS WELL

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.381
AS BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.183
THE CURRENT LAW ONLY COVERS

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.985
BUSINESSES THAT SOLD BEFORE AN

01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:10.987
EMERGENCY AND THAT WAS THE

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:13.055
CONCERN BACK IN NINETY FOUR

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:15.324
EXTENDS THE LAW TO COVER NEW

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:17.426
SELLERS AS WELL. SO THAT IT

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:19.128
FLIES FAIRLY TO ALL BUSINESSES

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:21.130
IN THE MARKETPLACE. A LARGE

01:03:21.197 --> 01:03:22.498
SCALE PRICE GUIDE YOU CAN BE

THREATEN HEALTH AND SAFETY.

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:27.403
SUCH AS A CASE WERE

INVESTIGATING PRESENTLY IN

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:31.307
NINETY FIVE MASKS BEING SOLD

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:37.547
FOR TEN TIMES THEIR COST. AS

01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:38.915
THE SENATORS POINT OUT THAT

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:41.250
MISDEMEANORS SOMETIMES DON'T TO

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:42.885
ADEQUATELY DETER LARGER

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.754
BUSINESSES. SO THIS BILL

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:45.988
PROVIDES FOR AN ALTERNATE

01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:47.423
FELONY MISDEMEANOR BUT WITH A

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.058

TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE.

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.299
SO THE FAMILY CAN ONLY BE USED

01:03:56.365 --> 01:03:58.367
FOR THE MOST SERIOUS CASES WE

01:03:58.434 --> 01:03:59.535
THINK THAT'S A FAIR AND

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:01.437
APPROPRIATE APPROACH I'LL BE

LONGER ACCESS. AND SO IT'S A

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:28.810
VERY BLUNT INSTRUMENT- AND I

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:30.078
KNOW THAT I THINK THIS. I

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:31.346

01:17:36.952 --> 01:17:39.488
BEFORE THIS BILL IS ON MY RADAR

ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:42.591
ORDER- I GOT OUT REACH FROM

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:45.560
HARDWARE STORES- IN MY DISTRICT

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:47.729
THAT I KNOW THAT. I GUESS THERE

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.231
MAY BE NO CALIFORNIA HARDWARE

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:51.033
ASSOCIATION WE GOT THE LETTER

01:17:51.099 --> 01:17:52.868
FROM THE NATIONAL. THE NORTH

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:54.236
AMERICAN RETAIL HARDWARE

01:17:54.302 --> 01:17:55.804
ASSOCIATION INDIANAPOLIS THEIR

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:57.239
OFFICES AND TESTIFIED TODAY

01:17:57.305 --> 01:17:59.074
THEY SENT A LETTER. CERTAINLY

01:17:59.141 --> 01:18:00.609
IN THE PROCESS OF SO BE IT I

01:18:00.675 --> 01:18:01.810
GUESS THE HARVESTERS MAYBE

01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:03.445
AREN'T AS ORGANIZED IN

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:04.246
CALIFORNIA OR DON'T HAVE A

01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:06.782
LOBBYIST- AND SO THIS HAS AND

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:09.051
AS- AS PART OF THE CONVERSATION

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.585
BUT- THE CONCERN IS THAT FOR

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:15.123
EXAMPLE IF A HARDWARE STORE.

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:16.725
HAS TO SHIFT TO A NEW. CLEANING

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:19.127
PRODUCT. AND LET'S SAY THEY'RE

01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:21.730
PAYING. A DOLLAR FIFTY FOR THAT

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:23.398
CLEANING PRODUCT. BAY WOULD BE

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:24.599
PRECLUDED FOM CHARGING MORE

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:26.201
THAN TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTY

01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:27.836
FIVE CENTS FOR IT. SO TWO

01:18:27.903 --> 01:18:29.104
DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS WILL BE

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:30.839
CONSIDER PRICE GOUGING EVEN

01:18:30.906 --> 01:18:31.373
THOUGH I THINK MOST PEOPLE

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.241
LOOKING AT THAT. WOULD SAY

01:18:33.308 --> 01:18:35.210
THAT'S NOT PRICE HOUSING- AND

01:18:35.277 --> 01:18:37.612
THE CHALLENGES THAT IN TERMS OF

01:18:37.679 --> 01:18:40.115
JUST COVERING THEIR OWN COSTS.

01:18:40.182 --> 01:18:42.918
OF STAFF OF. OVERHEAD IT CETERA

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:45.554
ETCETERA- ACCORDING TO A-

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:46.822
HARDWARE STORE IN OUR MY

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:47.956
DISTRICT TO I'VE SPOKEN TO THE

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:50.158
WHITE OF PHENOMENAL BUSINESS

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:51.927
LONG TIME HUNDRED YEAR OLD

01:18:51.993 --> 01:18:54.296
FAMILY BUSINESS. WHO I TRUST

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:55.764
AND THAT IS A GOOD ACTOR.

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:56.898
THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA LOSE

01:18:56.965 --> 01:19:00.535
MONEY- ON THESE- PRODUCTS. AND

01:19:00.602 --> 01:19:04.372
SO THAT IS A REAL CONCERN- FOR

01:19:04.439 --> 01:19:06.975
ME I'VE BEEN FIFTY PERCENT-

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:08.176
EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDS GOOD WHEN

01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:10.045
YOU READ IT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW

01:19:10.112 --> 01:19:11.146
AND THEN THE OTHER CONTACTS

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:13.348
WERE ALREADY OFFERING- NOT

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:14.516
BEING ABLE TO RAISE MORE THAN

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:15.484
TEN PERCENT. THAT MAKES ALL THE

01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:16.585
SENSE SENSE IN THE WORLD

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:18.653
ALREADY AS A BUSINESS IT'S A

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:19.754
PRICE. AND IF YOU'RE NOW

01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:21.389
RAISING IT DURING AN EMERGENCY

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:22.491
MORE THAN 10% WE KNOW WHY

01:19:22.557 --> 01:19:25.494
YOU'RE DOINGTHAT. BUT THE 50%

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.264
I THINK IS NOT VALID. AND HI

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:31.299
MARTY DESIRE WOULD BE FOR THAT

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:33.034
TO COME OUT OF THE BILL- WE'VE

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:34.136
CONVEYED TO THE GOVERNOR'S

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:36.805
OFFICE THAT WE- THINK IT'S NOT

01:19:36.872 --> 01:19:38.240
APPROPRIATE ON THE EXECUTIVE

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:41.977

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:03.498
THINK YOU THERE HAVE BEEN A

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:04.466
COUPLE VALID POINTS THAT HAVE

01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:07.536
BEEN RAISED HERE. ONE IS THAT-

01:20:07.602 --> 01:20:11.072
THE BILL DOES NOT- TAKE INTO.

01:20:11.139 --> 01:20:14.209
ITS CALCULATION. THE FIXED

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:16.711
COSTS. FOR THE HIGHER LABOR

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:18.146
COSTS SO FOR EXAMPLE SAN

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:20.682
FRANCISCO- WHERE THE FIXED

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:22.117
COSTS ARE PROBABLY HIGHER THAN

01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:23.919
OTHER PLACES STATE LABOR MAY BE

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:24.920
HIGHER THAN OTHER PLACES THE

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:28.456
STATE. THAT WE WILL WORK WITH

01:20:28.523 --> 01:20:29.958
YOU AND OTHERS TO MAKE SURE

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:32.761
THAT THAT WERE FIXED COSTS IN

01:20:32.827 --> 01:20:34.596
LABOR COSTS AND OTHER COSTS.

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:37.098
BASICALLY DON'T INCREASE THE

01:20:37.165 --> 01:20:38.533
PROFIT THAT'S OR AFTER WERE

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.402
AFTER FOLKS WHO ALSO GET THE

FACEMASK BUSINESS AND AS YOU

FIFTY CENTS IS ALL FOR TWENTY

01:20:45.073 --> 01:20:47.275
DOLLARS. AND SO- WILL WORK ON

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:48.510
THE LANGUAGE TO SEE IF WE

01:20:48.577 --> 01:20:52.113

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:52.948
DRESSES THAT ISSUE OTHER PLACES

IN THE BILL. YOU TALK ABOUT 10%

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:58.887
INCREASE DUE. OF FOCUS ON OTHER

CRACKS AND MORE LIKE WE'RE ONLY

01:24:28.163 --> 01:24:29.864
TALKING ABOUT EMERGENCY. IN THE

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:31.499
LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND DON'T

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:33.868
WORK. THE WAY IT SHOULD. WITH

01:24:33.935 --> 01:24:36.137
THE THEY SHOULD- DURING AN

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:39.240
EMERGENCY- IT IT IS TO PROTECT

01:24:39.307 --> 01:24:39.808
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAVE AN

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:41.009
EARTHQUAKE AND THERE'S AN AREA

01:24:41.075 --> 01:24:43.244
THAT IS IN. NEED OF FOOD OR

01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:47.682
OTHER KINDS OF. OF PRODUCTS- IT

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:50.151
IS BOTH. UNFAIR AND IMMORAL TO

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:52.887
COME IN AND MY VIEW. AND CHARGE

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:56.124
THOSE WHO ARE. AFFECTED

01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:57.358
EXORBITANT PRICES WERE IN

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:58.760
ESSENCE YOU'RE BENEFITING YOUR

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:03.731
PROP FUNDING FOR THEIR- UP THIS

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:05.200
FOR. SO ONLY EMERGENCIES DOES

01:25:05.266 --> 01:25:07.101
BY NUMBER TWO THE TEMPERS OF AS

01:25:07.168 --> 01:25:08.036
THINK SO WINNER PER OUT IT IT

01:25:08.102 --> 01:25:10.772
IS DRY OF FROM THE GOVERNOR'S

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:13.107
EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT IT'S 10%

01:25:13.174 --> 01:25:15.510
IT'S NOT 10% ABOVE YOUR COST

01:25:15.577 --> 01:25:17.345
IT'S 10% ABOVE WHAT YOU WERE

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:20.148
CHARGING BEFORE SO THAT YOU

01:25:20.215 --> 01:25:21.716
KNOW YOU THAT I SUPPOSE YOU CAN

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:24.385
INCREASE YOUR PRICES 9% AND BE

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:26.921
BE IN GOOD SHAPE. OF THAT'S OF

01:25:26.988 --> 01:25:28.890
IT'S A FAIR TO FOR MARK UP IT'S

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:30.358
A FAIR PROFIT DOING PENSIVE

01:25:30.425 --> 01:25:32.961
EMERGENCY- THE NOTHING REALLY

01:25:33.027 --> 01:25:35.797
MAGICAL ABOUT 10% COULD BE 11%

01:25:35.864 --> 01:25:38.233
COULD BE 9% BUT IT IT'S WHAT WE

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:42.237
THOUGHT WOULD BE SORT OF A FAIR

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:44.005

COSTS- NOT INCREASE IN IN YOUR

01:26:05.093 --> 01:26:06.628

WE CAN RESOLVE BOTH OF THE

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:51.072
CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:54.642
DESCRIBED. FIRST AN EXPLANATION

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:57.111
OF HOW THE- RULE WORKS FOR

01:26:57.178 --> 01:26:58.246
EXISTING SELLERS BECAUSE I

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:00.515
THINK IT. CAN RESOLVE SEVERAL

01:27:00.582 --> 01:27:02.250
THESE CONCERNS. FOR AN EXISTING

01:27:02.317 --> 01:27:04.085
SELLER SELLER PRIOR TO THE

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:07.722
EMERGENCY. THE CURRENT LAW. FOR

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:09.891
ME IT'S NOT ONLY THE 10%

01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:11.593
INCREASE THAT'S ACTUALLY EIGHTY

01:27:11.659 --> 01:27:13.494
AT THE END OF THE- THE

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:15.997
ARITHMETIC HERE THE CURRENT LAW

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:18.333
ALLOWS AN EXISTING BUSINESS. TO

01:27:18.399 --> 01:27:21.436
INCREASE ITS PRICE. TO COVER

01:27:21.502 --> 01:27:25.406
ANY INCREASED COSTS MATERIAL OF

01:27:25.473 --> 01:27:27.642
THE LABOR AND THE LIKE. IT

01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:31.646
ALLOWS THE BUSINESS TO ADD ITS

01:27:31.713 --> 01:27:35.249
CURRENT PROFIT MARGIN. ON TOP

01:27:35.316 --> 01:27:37.619
OF THOSE CHANGED COSTS THEN

01:27:37.685 --> 01:27:42.390
ALLOWS AN ADDITIONAL 10% ABOVE

01:27:42.457 --> 01:27:44.525
THAT SOME SOME OF THE INCREASED

01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:46.461
COSTS PLUS THEIR TRADITIONAL

01:27:46.527 --> 01:27:48.863
MARKUP SO CENTER WE'RE AM VERY

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.498
CONSCIOUS OF THE CONCERN THAT

01:27:50.565 --> 01:27:52.533
YOU EXPRESSED AND I'M CONFIDENT

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.669
WE CAN WORK OUT LANGUAGE TO

01:27:54.736 --> 01:27:56.537
MAKE THESE PRINCIPLES APPLY

01:27:56.604 --> 01:27:58.640
BOTH THE NEW SELLERS. CAN TO

01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:00.341
PRIOR SELLERS BUT BUT THE GOOD

01:28:00.408 --> 01:28:02.877
NEWS IS- FOR EXISTING

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:05.680
BUSINESSES THEY ARE PROTECTED

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:07.515
THEY CAN INCREASE THEIR PRICES

01:28:07.582 --> 01:28:10.084
TO COVER INCREASED COSTS THEY

01:28:10.151 --> 01:28:12.553
CAN APPLY THEIR TRADITIONAL

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:15.423
PROFIT MARGIN. AND EVEN 10%

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:16.824
BEYOND THAT SO THERE'S PLENTY

01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:19.093
OF SEATING AT IN MY JUDGMENT

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.295
DAN TO PROTECT EXISTING SELLERS

01:28:21.362 --> 01:28:23.164
AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN

01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:25.400

01:29:03.237 --> 01:29:05.206
SENATOR JACKSON HAD A COMMENT

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:06.874
AND THEN I CAN RETURN SO I A I

01:29:06.941 --> 01:29:08.076
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

01:29:08.142 --> 01:29:10.445
THIS BILL- GIVEN THE NATURE OF

01:29:10.511 --> 01:29:12.613
THIS YEAR- AND OBVIOUSLY

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.115
THERE'S STILL MORE WORK TO BE

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:16.484
DONE. I FIND PRODUCT PRICE

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:18.986
COUNTERS TO BE AMONG THE LOWEST

01:29:19.053 --> 01:29:21.622
OF THE LOW- THIS ISN'T A

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:24.759
QUESTION OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:25.293
THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF

01:29:25.359 --> 01:29:27.161
CHOICE. SUPPLY AND DEMAND I

01:29:27.228 --> 01:29:29.363
THINK AGAIN A PROPERLY APPLIES

01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:31.165
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE. IN A

01:29:31.232 --> 01:29:33.768
PANDEMIC OR IN AN EMERGENCY

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:35.770
SUCH AS WHAT YOUR BILL TALKS

01:29:35.837 --> 01:29:37.071
ABOUT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A

01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:38.973
CHOICE. AND THE FACT THAT

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.542
OTHERS WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF

01:29:41.609 --> 01:29:43.111
PEOPLE'S MISFORTUNE IN THIS

01:29:43.177 --> 01:29:46.280
FASHION. IS REALLY OFFENSIVE TO

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:48.282
ME SO I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE

01:29:48.349 --> 01:29:49.817
DOING HERE AND I THINK IT'S

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:52.120
APPROPRIATE AND I THINK. ANY

01:29:52.186 --> 01:29:54.555
ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY SUFFERS-

01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:56.824
IT ISN'T JUST THE POOR ALTHOUGH

01:29:56.891 --> 01:29:58.426
I SUSPECT THE POOR SUFFER MORE

01:29:58.493 --> 01:30:01.162
THAN MOST IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:02.063
THEY HAVE NO CHOICE WHETHER OR

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:03.898
NOT TO BUY. A PRODUCT AND AN

01:30:03.965 --> 01:30:05.700
OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:08.336
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT-

01:30:08.402 --> 01:30:11.572
SO I SEE THIS AS A AS- A VERY

01:30:11.639 --> 01:30:15.843
IMPORTANT- STATEMENT AND POLICY

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:18.379
IN MORAL POSITION TO TAKE- TO

01:30:18.446 --> 01:30:19.781
DISCOURAGE THIS KIND OF

01:30:19.847 --> 01:30:22.416
BEHAVIOR. IN THE MOST

01:30:22.483 --> 01:30:23.785
APPROPRIATE AND SIGNIFICANT WAY

01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:26.921
WE CAN AND SO MY QUESTION IS

01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:29.891
THIS. I'M ASSUMING MOST OF

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:32.527
THESE. COMPANIES THAT DO THIS

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:34.228
KIND OF A CHART DID CHARGE

01:30:34.295 --> 01:30:37.131
EXCESSIVELY. OUR CORPORATIONS

01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:39.233
SAID THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:41.369
GO OUT AND BUY IN BULK AND THEN

01:30:41.435 --> 01:30:42.770
CHARGE AND AN OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNT

01:30:42.837 --> 01:30:44.906
OF MONEY WHETHER WE'RE TALKING

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:47.275
MASKS AS AN EXAMPLE. CRIMINAL

01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:50.011
PROCEEDING SO GENERALLY- YOU

01:30:50.077 --> 01:30:50.978
CAN'T PUT A CORPORATION IN

01:30:51.045 --> 01:30:55.283
JAIL. UNFORTUNATELY DOES THIS.

01:30:55.349 --> 01:30:57.018
LEGISLATION ALLOW FOR THE

01:30:57.084 --> 01:30:58.519
PIERCING OF THE CORPORATE VEIL

01:30:58.586 --> 01:31:00.955
OF THE CORPORATE VEIL SO THAT

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:02.657
THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE THE

01:31:02.723 --> 01:31:04.625
CEOS OF THE UPPER MANAGEMENT

01:31:04.692 --> 01:31:05.827
THE PEOPLE MAKING THESE

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:07.728
DECISIONS WILL BE PERSONALLY

01:31:07.795 --> 01:31:09.096
LIABLE AND SUBJECT TO

01:31:09.163 --> 01:31:11.666
INCARCERATION OF NOT THAT WE'RE

01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:12.767
GOING TO PUT A WHOLE LOT OF

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:16.003
MISDEMEANOR IN- IN JAIL BUT IF

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:17.672
THESE WERE CHARGED IS AS

01:31:17.738 --> 01:31:20.374
FELONIES WOULD WE BE ABLE TO

01:31:20.441 --> 01:31:23.744
THEN TAKE AND- CHARGER THESE.

01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:25.980
INDIVIDUALS ARE FOR THE

01:31:26.047 --> 01:31:28.349
BEHAVIOR OF THEIR COMPANIES SO

01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:30.551
THAT THEY WOULD THEN HAVE MORE

01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:33.654
TO LOSE THAN PERHAPS SOME SMALL

01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:35.289
AMOUNT OF PROFIT FOR THE

01:31:35.356 --> 01:31:38.359
COMPANY THAT THEY WOULD BE

01:31:38.426 --> 01:31:39.527
INDIVIDUALLY LIABLE. BUT I HAD

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:41.662
SENATOR UMBERG AMIR SPINE THANK

01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:44.098
YOU THANK YOU SENATE JACKSON.

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:45.633
THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE LAW IN

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:46.167
TERMS OF PERSONAL

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:48.035
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CORPORATE

01:31:48.102 --> 01:31:50.605
ACTS SO IT WOULD BE. ANALOGOUS

01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:52.506
TO THE ENRON SITUATION SO YOU

01:31:52.573 --> 01:31:53.674
YOU CAN CHARGE BOTH THE

01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:55.076
CORPORATION AS WELL AS THE

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:56.344
INDIVIDUAL IF YOU CAN

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:57.345
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE

01:31:57.411 --> 01:31:59.914
INDIVIDUAL. MET THE CRITERIA

01:31:59.981 --> 01:32:01.415
FOR PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:05.019
EXAMPLE THEY WERE KNOWING. AND

01:32:05.086 --> 01:32:06.654
A DATE THEY WERE BOTH KNOWING

01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:08.956
AND HAD MADE THE DECISION TO

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:12.727
FOR EXAMPLE INCREASE PRICES SO.

01:32:12.793 --> 01:32:14.228
WELL THIS BILL DOESN'T DOESN'T

01:32:14.295 --> 01:32:15.897
CHANGE THE LAW INDIVIDUALS

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:18.699
COULD BE SUBJECT TO IT EVEN IF

01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:19.267
IT'S- THEIR ACTING THROUGH A

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:21.202
CORPORATION. THAT MAKES SENSE

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:23.571
THE CENTER IS A I THINK SO BUT

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:26.240
I. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:28.709
THAT PEOPLE NOT BE ABLE TO HIDE

01:32:28.776 --> 01:32:30.411
BEHIND THAT CORPORATE FAIL WHEN

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:32.079
THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES IN THIS

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:33.881
FASHION THE FACT THAT WE KNOW

01:32:33.948 --> 01:32:36.150
THAT WE LOST SOME OF OUR HEALTH

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:37.084
CARE WORKERS AND FIRST

01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:38.819
RESPONDERS BECAUSE THEY THE OF

01:32:38.886 --> 01:32:40.488
THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THESE

01:32:40.554 --> 01:32:42.189
MASS IN THE DESERT. DECISIONS

01:32:42.256 --> 01:32:44.892
MADE TO CHARGE MORE TO MAKE

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:48.162
MONEY. A IS TO EXERCISE GREED

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:49.830
IN THE OF THE WORST ORDER.

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:52.934
DURING A TIME WHEN WE ARE ALL.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.702
IT AT RISK AND ARE ALL

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:56.137
SUFFERING IN SOME FORM OR

ANOTHER FROM THE SUCH AS TO WHY

01:32:58.039 --> 01:32:59.840

WILL SUPPORT IT SO THAT THE

01:33:09.450 --> 01:33:11.886
PROCESS CAN CONTINUE AT WITH

01:33:11.953 --> 01:33:13.921
THAT OF COURSE SUBJECT TO THE

01:33:13.988 --> 01:33:15.556

WHETHER IT'S FOR WIPES- NOW

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:28.235
CHARGING TEN TIMES THE COST FOR

01:33:28.302 --> 01:33:30.471
WIPE SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO

01:33:30.538 --> 01:33:32.273

HEALTH OF OUR- FAMILIES AND OUR

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:37.144
COMMUNITY. THE NOTION THAT WE

01:33:37.211 --> 01:33:39.714
WILL ALLOW THE TO OUR UNWILLING

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:43.084
TO- TAKE SOME KIND OF-

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:46.187
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE- THE

PRICE GOUGING A STRONG COUPLE

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:01.302
CONCERNS I HAVE THAT I THAT I

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:04.538
LIKE TO ASK- IS CURRENT LAW I

01:34:04.605 --> 01:34:07.341
UNDERSTAND SAYS THAT- THINGS

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:08.442
WILL BE RESTATED WITHIN THIRTY

01:34:08.509 --> 01:34:09.810
DAYS BUT THERE'S NO TIME FRAME

01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:11.946
ON YOUR BILL. AND THEN AM I

01:34:12.013 --> 01:34:13.481
RIGHT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:34:13.547 --> 01:34:14.915
THE GOVERNOR WOULD DECIDE WHAT

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:17.284
AN EMERGENCY IS AND HOW LONG

01:34:17.351 --> 01:34:18.986
THE TIME FRAMES TO GO. IT IT IT

01:34:19.053 --> 01:34:20.354
IS TRUE IT'S DURING THE

01:34:20.421 --> 01:34:21.622
PENDENCY RUMORED SURPLUS THIRTY

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:24.392
DAYS SO AS IS THE CLERK BY THE

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:26.861
GOVERNOR THAT THAT'S CORRECT.

01:34:26.927 --> 01:34:30.164
SO THERE THERE'S NOT SO. IT IS.

01:34:30.231 --> 01:34:31.966
DISCRETIONARY FOR EXAMPLE ON

01:34:32.033 --> 01:34:33.401
THE PART OF THE GOVERNOR IS THE

01:34:33.467 --> 01:34:35.469
HOW LONG THAT EMERGENCY. SHOULD

01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:37.204
STILL BE IMPACTING CALIFORNIA

01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:39.407
HAD A BAD GOVERNOR NOT THAT OUR

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:41.242
GOVERNOR IS NOW WE GOT A BAD

01:34:41.308 --> 01:34:42.710
GOVERNOR MY SIDE OUT. THEY

01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:44.278
COULD USE THAT TO WEAPONIZE

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:48.082
BUSINESSES CUT NAY. THEY COULD-

01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:50.117
I'LL I WOULD HOPE THAT THE- IF

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:51.752
WE HAVE A BAD GOVERNOR WE WOULD

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:53.788
NOT HAVE A BAD LEGISLATURE AND

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:55.556
THAT THAT THEY COULD ACT. TO

01:34:55.623 --> 01:34:57.358
SEIZE THE EMERGENCY. I

01:34:57.425 --> 01:34:59.193
APPRECIATE THAT YOU HOPE APPLE

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.528
WOULDN'T BE BETTER TO CLEARLY

01:35:00.594 --> 01:35:02.229
STATED IN YOUR BILL. BUT TO

01:35:02.296 --> 01:35:03.631
STATE THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:35:03.697 --> 01:35:04.899
OVERRIDE THE GOVERNOR NO TO

01:35:04.965 --> 01:35:05.900
STATE THAT THERE'D BE A TIME

01:35:05.966 --> 01:35:08.202
FRAME ON THESE THINGS. IN THE

01:35:08.269 --> 01:35:09.437
CURRENT EXACTLY YOU KNOW

01:35:09.503 --> 01:35:10.938
SPECIFICATIONS ON THE TYPES OF

01:35:11.005 --> 01:35:13.107
EMERGENCIES. SO THAT WE DON'T

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:15.609
HAVE A GOVERNOR THAT. AND

01:35:15.676 --> 01:35:17.211
RECLAIM SOME SUBMERGENCE SEE

01:35:17.278 --> 01:35:18.612
ONE IT'S REALLY NOT BELT BUT I

01:35:18.679 --> 01:35:21.849
THINK THAT. I UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:24.752
CONCERN OF. THE THERE IS A LAW

01:35:24.819 --> 01:35:26.554
THAT DEFINES WHEN AN EMERGENCY

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.689
COULD BE DECLARED IN AND I

01:35:28.756 --> 01:35:30.424
RECALL CORRECTLY UNDER WHAT

01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:32.693
CONDITIONS IT CAN CONTINUE THIS

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.862
BILL DOESN'T. THE ONLY AS MY

01:35:34.929 --> 01:35:37.398
UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW MY

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:38.766
DAUGHTER AND WE CAN ASK THE

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:40.501
CONSULTANT TO CORRECT IF EITHER

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:43.471
OF US ARE MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:45.506
STATUTE WHICH DEFINES WHAT CAN

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:46.440
BE A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:48.776
ONLY. THING THAT THIS BILL DOES

01:35:48.843 --> 01:35:50.211
RELATIONSHIP TO THAT IS ADD

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:52.046
PANDEMIC BECAUSE PANDEMIC WAS

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:54.949
NOT IN THE ORIGINAL STATUTE.

01:35:55.015 --> 01:35:59.019
AND THE ADDITIONAL- ACTION THAT

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:01.155
THIS BILL IS DOING IS BECAUSE

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:03.958
THE BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL PRICE

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:06.494
GOUGING STATUTE IS ONLY OP. THE

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.896
TIMES OF EMERGENCY. THIS IS

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:10.998
MODIFYING THE PRICE GOUGING

01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:13.634
STATUTE TO- WITH THE IN WITH

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:15.803
HIS ACCEPTING OF THE AMENDMENTS

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:18.506
TO. ALLOW IT TO BE A WAFFLER.

01:36:18.572 --> 01:36:21.742
AND AS I INDICATED PREVIOUSLY

01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:23.844
ADDING PANDEMIC AS A CATEGORY

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:27.481
OF EMERGENCY. DID AYE ASK

01:36:27.548 --> 01:36:29.717
ACCURATELY PORTRAY THAT. THE

01:36:29.783 --> 01:36:30.885

THERE'S ANYONE ELSE WANTS

01:39:58.859 --> 01:40:04.631
COMMON- MORE QUESTION FIVE. THE

01:40:04.698 --> 01:40:06.633
ORIGINAL BILL HAD BOTH THE

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:08.669
LOBULAR AND A SEARCH WARRANT

01:40:08.736 --> 01:40:12.606
FOR MISDEMEANORS. NOW WE- I

01:40:12.673 --> 01:40:15.442
LOOK I THINK ALL OF US WELL LET

01:40:15.509 --> 01:40:18.078
ME SPEAK FOR MYSELF SO I DO

01:40:18.145 --> 01:40:20.180
REALLY BELIEVE IN CONSUMER

01:40:20.247 --> 01:40:22.116
PROTECTION ESPECIALLY DURING.

01:40:22.182 --> 01:40:24.385
THIS KIND OF AN EMERGENCY WHERE

01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:25.619
PEOPLE DO TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:40:25.686 --> 01:40:30.190
OF. AND BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT SO

01:40:30.257 --> 01:40:32.393
IT IS EIGHTY WHETHER IT'S A BIG

01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:33.827
CORPORATION THAT DOES IT OR

01:40:33.894 --> 01:40:35.429
YOUR CORNER STORE IS JUST AS

01:40:35.496 --> 01:40:37.398
BAD TO THE CONSUMER TO CONSUMER

01:40:37.464 --> 01:40:39.600
DOESN'T CARE. HOWEVER THERE'S

01:40:39.666 --> 01:40:42.136
SOME PERCEPTION BY CONSUMERS

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:43.804
THAT THE CORNER STORE WHO

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:46.006
SELLING SAY AN ITEM FOR MUCH

01:40:46.073 --> 01:40:48.041
MORE THEN YOU'D BUY IT AT

01:40:48.108 --> 01:40:49.743
COSTCO OR TARGET THAT SOMEHOW

01:40:49.810 --> 01:40:51.011
THAT MEANS IT'S PRICE GOUGING.

01:40:51.078 --> 01:40:53.380
AND THE CONSUMERS NOT REALIZING

01:40:53.447 --> 01:40:56.250
THAT KNOW THAT SMALL STORE

01:40:56.316 --> 01:40:58.719
COULD IT BY IN THEIR HAVING NO

01:40:58.786 --> 01:41:01.522
THEIR **** SUPPLY CHAIN IS

01:41:01.588 --> 01:41:06.293
ALSO- WHATEVER LIMITED THEY

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:07.661
DON'T BUY IN THE BOOK THAT THE

01:41:07.728 --> 01:41:10.063
TARGETS OF THE COST GOES. DíAS

01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:12.332
THEY REALLY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT

01:41:12.399 --> 01:41:13.734
TO SELL IT AT THAT HIGH PRICE

01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:15.269
AT LEAST THEY'RE MAKING IT

01:41:15.335 --> 01:41:17.438
AVAILABLE TO YOU. SO IT THIS IS

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:19.306
ONE OF THESE AND THREADING THE

01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:22.142
NEEDLE. WELL I DO NOT WANT ANY

01:41:22.209 --> 01:41:25.045
STORE PRICE GOUGING ANYONE I

01:41:25.112 --> 01:41:27.514
ALSO DON'T WANT TO LOOK HAVE A

01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:29.216
FISHING EXPEDITION WHAT BECAUSE-

01:41:29.283 --> 01:41:31.518
YOU. A CORNER STORE THAT IS

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:33.153
SELLING SOMETHING AT A HIGH

01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:34.755
PRICE WHICH MADE MAYBE REALLY

01:41:34.822 --> 01:41:37.024
THEY HAVE NO CHOICE. AND A

01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:40.260
PROSECUTOR WANTS TO YOU KNOW

01:41:40.327 --> 01:41:42.329
GET A HEADLINE OF. THE WIND SEE

01:41:42.396 --> 01:41:46.233
WE'VE YOU KNOW DON'T. WITH

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:47.534
PRICE GOUGING HERE. AND THEN IS

01:41:47.601 --> 01:41:48.168
YOU KNOW IT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE

01:41:48.235 --> 01:41:49.803
MISDEMEANOR DATE THAT WE GIVE

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:51.004
THEM THE ABILITY TO GO GET A

01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:52.673
SEARCH WARRANT AND OF COURSE

01:41:52.739 --> 01:41:54.107
THE SEARCH WARRANT IN AND OF

01:41:54.174 --> 01:41:57.344
ITSELF. IS VERY DISRUPTIVE TO A

01:41:57.411 --> 01:41:58.278
TO A BUSINESS OR TWO AND

01:41:58.345 --> 01:42:02.282
COSTLY. SO NOW A WAFFLER. I

01:42:02.349 --> 01:42:04.351
DON'T LIKE RARE IF ANYBODY WHO

01:42:04.418 --> 01:42:05.819
WATCHES THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:08.355
THAT WE RARELY EVER INCREASE

01:42:08.422 --> 01:42:12.292
THE PENALTY YOUR IT OR- TURN A

01:42:12.359 --> 01:42:13.694
CRIME THAT IS OTHER WHAT

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:16.096
MISDEMEANOR AND FELONY. WE TRY

01:42:16.163 --> 01:42:18.832
TO AVOID. BUT I THINK WE AND

01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:21.568
JUST FOR THE MEMBERS TO KNOW

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:23.103
THERE WAS A LOT OF A THERE WAS

01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:24.404
A LOT OF DISCUSSION ON THIS

01:42:24.471 --> 01:42:25.806
BILL THERE WAS A LOT OF BACK

01:42:25.873 --> 01:42:27.508
AND FORTH MICE THE STAFF AND

01:42:27.574 --> 01:42:29.610
THE COMMITTEE WORKED I THINK

01:42:29.676 --> 01:42:32.646
REALLY- DID JUST REALLY

01:42:32.713 --> 01:42:34.715
DILIGENTLY AND LOT OF GREAT

01:42:34.781 --> 01:42:36.850
INTERACTION WITH SENATOR UMBERG

01:42:36.917 --> 01:42:38.819
IN HIS STAFF TO TRY TO FIGURE

01:42:38.886 --> 01:42:40.687
OUT OKAY. HOW DO WE OUR

01:42:40.754 --> 01:42:42.523
OBJECTIVE IN THE COMMITTEES

01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:43.991
OBJECTIVE WAS TO PROTECT

01:42:44.057 --> 01:42:46.960
CONSUMERS BUT NOT JUST JUST-

01:42:47.027 --> 01:42:49.196
YOU KNOW CREATE THIS BIG NET

01:42:49.263 --> 01:42:50.797
FOR BIG FISHING EXPEDITIONS AND

01:42:50.864 --> 01:42:52.966
SO WE ENDED WITH SENATOR

01:42:53.033 --> 01:42:55.269
UMBERG'S. AGREEMENT THOUGH I

01:42:55.335 --> 01:42:57.037
WILL SAY THE AUTHOR WOULD

01:42:57.104 --> 01:42:57.971
PREFER THE SEARCH WARRANT BUT

01:42:58.038 --> 01:43:00.541
THAT'S OKAY TO GO WAFFLER

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:03.043
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR THOSE

01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:05.779
SITUATIONS WHERE THE DA CAN

01:43:05.846 --> 01:43:07.014
PROVE TO THE COURT OR

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.448
DEMONSTRATE TO THE COURT THAT

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:08.949
THEY REALLY THINK THIS

01:43:09.016 --> 01:43:11.184
SITUATION IS EGREGIOUS THAT

01:43:11.251 --> 01:43:12.286
THEY CAN GET THE SEARCH

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:14.655
WARRANT. AND SPREAD IT DOESN'T

01:43:14.721 --> 01:43:16.023
JUST AUTOMATICALLY GRANT THE

01:43:16.089 --> 01:43:18.125
SEARCH WARRANT FOR SOMETHING

01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:21.028
THAT IS A MIST MISDEMEANORS

01:43:21.094 --> 01:43:23.196
THAT'S WHAT I WE WENT WITH THE

01:43:23.263 --> 01:43:25.599
DIRECTION WE WENT I IMAGINE I'M

01:43:25.666 --> 01:43:32.205
SURE THERE'S SOME. THE. WHO

01:43:32.272 --> 01:43:34.675
WHATEVER LIKE TO RETURN. THAT

01:43:34.741 --> 01:43:36.710
FEEL THAT EVEN ALONE IS. TWO

01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:39.046
FOUR. BUT I AM COME IN. IT

01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:42.082
BECAUSE IT IS A LIMITED TERM

01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:44.318
PRICE GOUGING ONLY APPLIES

01:43:44.384 --> 01:43:46.453
DURING THESE EMERGENCIES. AND

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:49.723
SO THAT IS THAT LOGIC AND THAT

01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:50.958
IS WHY I AM SUPPORTING THE

01:43:51.024 --> 01:43:52.492
AMENDMENT THAT'S WHY I'M A AND

01:43:52.559 --> 01:43:54.494
THE BILL. AND APPRECIATIVE OF

01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:56.763
THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THE

01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:58.298
MINUTE. AND WITH THAT I'LL SEE

01:43:58.365 --> 01:44:00.167
IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS

01:44:00.233 --> 01:44:02.269
OTHERWISE YOU MAY CLOSE. AS

01:44:02.336 --> 01:44:03.270
THEY CAN AND YOU'RE JUST A

01:44:03.337 --> 01:44:05.205
COUPLE QUICK COMMENTS WILL WE

01:44:05.272 --> 01:44:06.440
WILL GO DOWN THE SEARCH WARRANT

01:44:06.506 --> 01:44:09.376
HOLD BUT- IT SEARCH WARRANTS

01:44:09.443 --> 01:44:10.911
ARE CRITICAL IN A WHITE COLLAR

01:44:10.978 --> 01:44:12.746
CASE LIKE PRICE GOUGING BECAUSE

01:44:12.813 --> 01:44:15.082
YOU YOU YOU CAN'T PROVE. WHAT

01:44:15.148 --> 01:44:16.717
THE PROFIT MARGIN IS WITHOUT

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:17.718
GETTING THE UNDERLYING

01:44:17.784 --> 01:44:19.620
DOCUMENTS FOR THE MOST PART AND

01:44:19.686 --> 01:44:21.455
IN SOME COMMUNITIES OF FOR

01:44:21.521 --> 01:44:24.958
EXAMPLE MY OWN DISTRICT PEOPLE-

THE FENCE SO YOU SOME SAY NO WE

02:09:31.597 --> 02:09:33.132
WERE TRYING TO CA. THAT SO I

02:09:33.198 --> 02:09:34.500

OFFICIAL MAYBE YES MAYBE NO

02:09:41.607 --> 02:09:42.441
BUT BUT I DON'T THINK WE COULD

02:09:42.508 --> 02:09:43.909
MAKE THAT. THAT THAT

02:09:43.976 --> 02:09:46.945
ASSUMPTION- SO DISTRIBUTARY

FIRST OF ALL WE ARE IN MANY OF

02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:03.061
THESE SITUATIONS DEALING WITH

02:10:03.128 --> 02:10:04.596
PERSONNEL ACTIONS THAT HAVE

02:10:04.663 --> 02:10:06.532
BEEN TAKEN BY A FRONTLINE

02:10:06.598 --> 02:10:10.002
POLICE AGENCY AND THEN WE LEARN

02:10:10.068 --> 02:10:13.572
ABOUT IT- VIA BRADY AND THE

02:10:13.639 --> 02:10:14.373
PITCHES HEARING PROCESS

FOLLOWING A JUDICIAL DECISION.

02:10:16.542 --> 02:10:20.012
SO IN SOME OF THOSE CASES- LAW

02:10:20.078 --> 02:10:23.215
ENFORCEMENT DOES TERMINATE- BUT

02:10:23.282 --> 02:10:25.584
THE INDIVIDUAL OFFICER-

02:10:25.651 --> 02:10:27.152
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT INVOLVES

02:10:27.219 --> 02:10:31.190
SERIOUS ACTS OF DISHONESTY- BUT

02:10:31.256 --> 02:10:34.059
THAT OFFICER MAY STILL WIND UP

02:10:34.126 --> 02:10:35.594
EVEN AFTER THEIR TERMINATED-

02:10:35.661 --> 02:10:37.396
BEING A WITNESS IN A SUBSEQUENT

02:10:37.462 --> 02:10:39.698
CASE AND THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE

02:10:39.765 --> 02:10:42.668
DISCLOSED TO THE DEFENSE. AND

02:10:42.734 --> 02:10:45.204
WOULD WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THE

OFFICER WOULD BE THE FORMER

02:10:47.005 --> 02:10:48.407
OFFICER WOULD BE SUBJECT

02:10:48.473 --> 02:10:51.210
SUBJECTED TO EXAMINATION ON

02:10:51.276 --> 02:10:56.048
THAT ISSUE IN OTHER CASES-

02:10:56.114 --> 02:10:57.849
INVOLVING. ACTION THE AGENCY

02:10:57.916 --> 02:10:58.984
MAY WANT TO TERMINATE THE

02:10:59.051 --> 02:11:00.953
OFFICER BUT MAY BE PROHIBITED

02:11:01.019 --> 02:11:03.055
FROM DOING SO BY THE JUDICIAL

02:11:03.121 --> 02:11:05.257
AUTHORITY OR AN ADMINISTRATIVE

02:11:05.324 --> 02:11:07.226
HEARING PROCESS AND SO THOSE

02:11:07.292 --> 02:11:08.894
OFFICERS THAT STILL REMAIN ON

02:11:08.961 --> 02:11:12.097
THE FORCE- WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

02:11:12.164 --> 02:11:13.966
THIS PROCESS AND WE WOULD HAVE

02:11:14.032 --> 02:11:16.201
ACCESS. TO AT LEAST THEIR NAME

02:11:16.268 --> 02:11:17.703
AND BADGE NUMBER SO THAT WE

02:11:17.769 --> 02:11:19.838
COULD REQUEST A JUDICIAL

02:11:19.905 --> 02:11:21.773
HEARING AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:24.309
THAT PRIOR MISCONDUCT- WARNS

02:11:24.376 --> 02:11:26.245
DISCLOSURE UNDER BRADY IN A IN

02:11:26.311 --> 02:11:27.913
A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE WOULD

02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:29.915
WOULD MAKE THAT WHAT THIS BILL

02:11:29.982 --> 02:11:32.651
SEEKS TO DO IS INSURE THAT WE

02:11:32.718 --> 02:11:34.386
SIMPLY HAVE THE NAME AND BADGE

02:11:34.453 --> 02:11:36.655
NUMBER. OF THE OFFICERS THAT

02:11:36.722 --> 02:11:38.090
HAVE THESE ISSUES IN THEIR

02:11:38.156 --> 02:11:39.391
BACKGROUND SO THAT WE CAN

02:11:39.458 --> 02:11:41.927
APPROPRIATELY DISCLOSE

02:11:41.994 --> 02:11:44.429
EXCULPATORY INFORMATION TO THE

MORAL TURPITUDE AND DISHONESTY

02:11:51.403 --> 02:11:53.772
BUT- SUSTAIN FINDINGS OF SEXUAL

02:11:53.839 --> 02:11:56.908
ASSAULT. OF WITH A MEMBER OF

02:11:56.975 --> 02:11:58.744
THE PUBLIC SO. THESE ARE SOME

02:11:58.810 --> 02:12:02.047
SERIOUS SERIOUS- CONSIDERATIONS

02:12:02.114 --> 02:12:04.316
AND I DO APPRECIATE. THAT

02:12:04.383 --> 02:12:06.184
RESPONSE THANK YOU DISTRICT

02:12:06.251 --> 02:12:08.453
ATTORNEY TODD. RIGHT ANY OTHER

02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:10.589
MEMBERS WANT TO ASK A QUESTION

02:12:10.656 --> 02:12:13.125
OR COMMENT CENTER BRADFORD. NOT

02:12:13.191 --> 02:12:14.393
AS MUCH OF A QUESTION BUT A

02:12:14.459 --> 02:12:16.762
STATEMENT AND I APPRECIATE- THE

02:12:16.828 --> 02:12:17.929
WORK THAT CENTER ON BURKE IS

02:12:17.996 --> 02:12:19.531
DONE IN THIS YEAR IT'S NO DOUBT

02:12:19.598 --> 02:12:22.734
THAT. WE NEED TO HAVE AS MUCH

02:12:22.801 --> 02:12:24.469
INFORMATION AS TO BAD ACTORS

02:12:24.536 --> 02:12:26.371
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT.

02:12:26.438 --> 02:12:28.273
THE STATE THIS COUNTRY EVEN

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:29.941
WHEN YOU CATCH IT ON VIDEOTAPE

02:12:30.008 --> 02:12:31.943
MANY OF THESE ALTER STEEL-

02:12:32.010 --> 02:12:35.213
SCAPE- PROSECUTION OR EVEN

02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:37.649
CHARGES SO I THINK IT'S TIME WE

02:12:37.716 --> 02:12:39.418
I JUST DON'T THINK IT GOES FAR

02:12:39.484 --> 02:12:40.986
ENOUGH I THINK IT STILL

02:12:41.053 --> 02:12:42.821
PROVIDES TOO MUCH OF A LEAD WAY

02:12:42.888 --> 02:12:45.957
TO- ALLOW OFFICERS TO BE ESCAPE

02:12:46.024 --> 02:12:48.126
FROM THIS AND I DO BELIEVE

02:12:48.193 --> 02:12:49.594
THERE NEEDS TO BE. A

02:12:49.661 --> 02:12:51.296
OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR THEIR

02:12:51.363 --> 02:12:53.432
NAMES AS IT STATES HERE BUT I

02:12:53.498 --> 02:12:55.133
THINK THE SAME OPPORTUNITY

02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:56.568
SHOULD BE AFFORDED TO BLACK AND

02:12:56.635 --> 02:12:58.003
BROWN INDIVIDUALS WHO SPEND THE

02:12:58.070 --> 02:12:59.471
REST OF YOUR LIFE ON GANG

02:12:59.538 --> 02:13:01.573
INJUNCTIONS AND THEY'RE NEVER

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:03.675
FOR THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY SO. I

02:13:03.742 --> 02:13:05.277
THINK UNTIL WE CAN HAVE SOME

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:07.446
BALANCE HERE- I OR EVEN MORE

02:13:07.512 --> 02:13:11.917
FIXED OF. WHAT C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. BE ON THE&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:13:11.983 --> 02:13:13.218
LIST I'M HAVE TO STAY OFF OF

02:13:13.285 --> 02:13:18.423
FOR TODAY BUT I THINK YOU'RE.

02:13:18.490 --> 02:13:21.026
HER EIGHT AS YOU TO CLOSE. SO

02:13:21.093 --> 02:13:27.532
THIS ONE IS. IT WILL THIS OF A-

02:13:27.599 --> 02:13:28.033
GREAT CAN UNDER FOR THE

02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:30.569
COMEDIAN THAT WE HAVE THE MANY

02:13:30.635 --> 02:13:32.604
OF THE SAME ENTITIES THAT

02:13:32.671 --> 02:13:34.473
SUPPORTED FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:13:34.539 --> 02:13:37.242
POLICE RECORDS BILL SB FOURTEEN

02:13:37.309 --> 02:13:39.444
TWENTY ONE NOW OPPOSING THIS-

02:13:39.511 --> 02:13:42.881
BUT WE ALSO HAVE- SOME AT LEAST

02:13:42.948 --> 02:13:46.418
ARE POLICE- UNIONS AND- THE

02:13:46.485 --> 02:13:50.355
ALSO OPPOSING. AND YOU KNOW HOW

02:13:50.422 --> 02:13:52.791
HOW AGAIN FOR USE THE PHRASE

02:13:52.858 --> 02:13:53.625
APPEARS TO MANY TIMES STATE

02:13:53.692 --> 02:13:56.862
THREAD THAT NEEDLE AND- WHAT

02:13:56.928 --> 02:14:00.866
WHAT STRIKES ME ABOUT WHAT THE

02:14:00.932 --> 02:14:03.769
BILL IS TRYING TO DO. IS A

02:14:03.835 --> 02:14:06.605
NARROW CODIFICATION OF A COURT

02:14:06.671 --> 02:14:11.576
RULING AND WHAT- I SUPPOSE WHAT

02:14:11.643 --> 02:14:16.181
I'D- I'D APPRECIATE- THAT. LAW

02:14:16.248 --> 02:14:19.785
ENFORCEMENT. DIDN'T LIKE THAT

02:14:19.851 --> 02:14:22.754
COURT RULING AND SO DOESN'T

02:14:22.821 --> 02:14:26.024
NECESSARILY- WOULD NOT LIKE US

02:14:26.091 --> 02:14:28.226
TO CODIFY THE COURT RULING BUT

02:14:28.293 --> 02:14:29.494
I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WE

02:14:29.561 --> 02:14:32.831
ALREADY HAVE OFFICERS OF THE

02:14:32.898 --> 02:14:35.000
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN

02:14:35.066 --> 02:14:36.768
VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE WHO

02:14:36.835 --> 02:14:39.004
ARE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF

02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:40.405
THIS LOG BECAUSE THEY ARE

02:14:40.472 --> 02:14:42.841
COUNTIES OPTED TO COMPLY WITH

02:14:42.908 --> 02:14:45.143
THE COURT RULING. NOW IT IS NOT

02:14:45.210 --> 02:14:47.212
BEEN CONSISTENT IT IS NOT

02:14:47.279 --> 02:14:50.582
EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE THAT-

02:14:50.649 --> 02:14:52.717
OFFICERS ARE SUBJECT TO THIS

02:14:52.784 --> 02:14:55.420
BECAUSE NOT ALL YOU KNOW BUT

02:14:55.487 --> 02:14:56.955
FOR EXAMPLE THE SEATS IF I

02:14:57.022 --> 02:14:58.123
DON'T KNOW QUITE WHY THE STATE

02:14:58.190 --> 02:15:01.026
DIDN'T BUT CHP IS NOT. HAVING

02:15:01.092 --> 02:15:03.495
TO COMPLY THIS WAY- BUT MANY IN

02:15:03.562 --> 02:15:05.263
MANY COUNTIES EVERY OTHER LAW

02:15:05.330 --> 02:15:08.767
ENFORCEMENT. OFFICIAL DOES SO

02:15:08.834 --> 02:15:14.172
WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT MANY OF

02:15:14.239 --> 02:15:18.677
OUR- ADVOCATES WOULD WOULD AS

02:15:18.743 --> 02:15:21.179
CENTER BRADFORD DESCRIBED WANT

02:15:21.246 --> 02:15:26.852
US TO. NOT MOVE TO CODIFY THIS

02:15:26.918 --> 02:15:31.122
WITHOUT BEING MORE EXPANSIVE I

02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:36.261
GUESS WHERE I FELL IS THAT.

02:15:36.328 --> 02:15:37.362
THIS I A STEP IN THE RIGHT

02:15:37.429 --> 02:15:39.564
DIRECTION NOW OF COURSE THERE

02:15:39.631 --> 02:15:42.334
IS ALWAYS THE CONCERN THAT IF

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:45.270
WE TAKETHIS STEP THEN. IT WILL

02:15:45.337 --> 02:15:47.539
BE A EITHER WILL MAKE IT VERY

02:15:47.606 --> 02:15:49.441
VERY DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO

02:15:49.508 --> 02:15:52.210
GO FURTHER NOW OF COURSE FROM

02:15:52.277 --> 02:15:53.545
LAW ENFORCEMENT SINCE

02:15:53.612 --> 02:15:56.147
PERSPECTIVE ARE TAKING EVEN

02:15:56.214 --> 02:15:57.849
THIS STEP IS A STEP TOO FAR.

02:15:57.916 --> 02:16:00.485
AND I GUESS I AM COMFORTABLE

02:16:00.552 --> 02:16:02.888
WITH CODIFYING. THE COURT

02:16:02.954 --> 02:16:05.423
DECISION IN THE NEAR A WAY THAT

02:16:05.490 --> 02:16:06.157
IT'S BEEN CONSTRUCTED I

02:16:06.224 --> 02:16:11.162
CERTAINLY DO- AND WOULD

02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:11.696
ENTERTAIN A BILL THAT WENT

02:16:11.763 --> 02:16:15.967
FURTHER. BUT I GUESS I DON'T

02:16:16.034 --> 02:16:19.371
OPPOSE TAKING THE POSITIVE STEP

02:16:19.437 --> 02:16:22.874
IN THE DIRECTION SO- THAT IS

02:16:22.941 --> 02:16:25.176
WHY I HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT IS

02:16:25.243 --> 02:16:27.212
WHY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE

02:16:27.279 --> 02:16:30.315
BILL IS CONSTRUCTED. AND

02:16:30.382 --> 02:16:33.151
APPRECIATING THAT FEAR AS WE'VE

02:16:33.218 --> 02:16:35.020
HEARD FROM THE TESTIMONY THERE

02:16:35.086 --> 02:16:37.455
WILL BE MANY- THERE WILL BE LAW

02:16:37.522 --> 02:16:39.558
ENFORCEMENT TO DO NOT- LIKE

02:16:39.624 --> 02:16:41.092
THAT DECISION IN THERE WILL BE

02:16:41.159 --> 02:16:43.495
ADVOCATES WHO OR ADVOCATES- LAW

02:16:43.562 --> 02:16:44.529
ENFORCEMENT'S ALSO ADVOCATES

02:16:44.596 --> 02:16:46.531
BUT RATHER. ADVOCATE TO WANT

02:16:46.598 --> 02:16:48.934
MORE DISCLOSURE WHO WOULD NOT

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:52.103
BE HAPPY WITH THAT BUT I THINK

02:16:52.170 --> 02:16:54.940
SOME ACTION TO MAKE IT A LEVEL

02:16:55.006 --> 02:16:57.108
PLAYING FIELD ACROSS THE STATE

02:16:57.175 --> 02:16:57.776
THAT SO THAT ALL LAW

02:16:57.842 --> 02:16:59.711
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE.

02:16:59.778 --> 02:17:01.980
FUNCTIONING UNDER THE COURT

02:17:02.047 --> 02:17:04.282
RULING IS AT IMPROVEMENT OVER

02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:08.987
WHAT WE HAVE NOW. LET'S SEE IF

02:17:09.054 --> 02:17:12.290
THERE IS A MOTION OR NOT. SO

A CEILING COULD DO MORE. IT'S A

02:18:06.211 --> 02:18:10.048

FILE. FROM THE POLICE OFFICERS

PERSPECTIVE. IT IS TRUE AND

02:18:23.495 --> 02:18:24.629
I'VE HEARD MANY STORIES OF

02:18:24.696 --> 02:18:25.964
POLICE OFFICERS THAT ARE PUT ON

02:18:26.031 --> 02:18:27.332
THE BRADY LIST THAT PERHAPS IT

SHOULD BE ON THE BRINK LIST.

02:18:28.633 --> 02:18:30.568
BUT MANY PLACES IN THE STATE

02:18:30.635 --> 02:18:31.836
ARE NOT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE

02:18:31.903 --> 02:18:33.805
ALAMEDA CEMETERY VENTURA COUNTY

FOR ANY REVIEW. THEY DON'T HAVE

02:18:36.775 --> 02:18:38.009
AN OTHER THAN GOING TO COURT IN

02:18:38.076 --> 02:18:40.178
AND FILING A WRIT WHICH IS BOTH

02:18:40.245 --> 02:18:41.279
EXPENSIVE AND VERY VERY

02:18:41.346 --> 02:18:42.547

ATTORNEY'S PERSPECTIVE. THEY

WANT TO DO THEY WANT TO DO

02:19:05.036 --> 02:19:07.472
