AND TO THERE'S A REAL QUIRKINESS IN REGARD TO PAYMENT FOR BOOKS- COUNTY REIMBURSEMENT TENDS TO HAPPEN LATER IN THE SEMESTER. SOME KIDS ARE AVOIDING THAT OBLIGATION OR WORRIED ABOUT IT SO THEY'RE NOT GETTING THEIR BOOKS TO START THIS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO GET THAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE ONLY. SO THOSE ARE TWO KEY ISSUES THERE- THE COMMITTEE AT RAISE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT- PART TIME STUDENTS- GET ME AN ELIGIBLE LINE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO.
