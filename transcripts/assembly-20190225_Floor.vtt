01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:07.416
BLACK COLLEGES.

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:11.320
WAS VERY SHARP VERY SMART.

01:13:11.386 --> 01:13:12.721
YOU SHOULD REMEMBER HIM AS A MAN

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:14.389
WHO TRULY BELIEVE IN THE

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:15.390
PRINCIPLES THAT WE OFTEN TALK

YOU KNOW PEOPLE TALK ABOUT CIVIL

01:13:18.594 --> 01:13:19.561
RIGHTS.

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:20.863
THE TALK ABOUT EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:22.498
IN ACCESS.

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:25.200
BAYARD RUSTIN PUT HIMSELF ALWAYS

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:26.802
ON THE LINE FOR JUSTICE AND

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:28.470
EQUALITY.

01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:31.240
EVEN AS A STUDENT WILBERFORCE.

01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:32.574
HE BASICALLY WAS KICKED OUT OF

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:34.476
WILBERFORCE UNIVERSITY BECAUSE

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:36.612
HE ORGANIZED A PROTEST AND A

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:38.547
STRIKE AT THIS COLLEGE.

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:40.182
HE TALKED ABOUT JUSTICE AND

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:41.850
EQUALITY EVERYWHERE HE WENT.

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.886
HE ACTUALLY SPENT TWO YEARS IN

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:45.587
PRISON BECAUSE HE WAS A

01:13:45.654 --> 01:13:46.855
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR TO WORLD

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:48.724
WAR.

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:49.758
TWO HE WAS A MAN WHO WAS A

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:51.426
PACIFIST WHO BELIEVE IN THE

01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:53.195
PRINCIPLES OF GANDHI NOT JUST IN

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:55.197
SOME ABSTRACT SENSE WITHIN A

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:56.598
REAL PRACTICAL SINCE.

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:57.699
HE BELIEVED IN EQUALITY OF

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:59.234
EVERYONE.

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:01.637
HE WAS A GAY AFRICAN AMERICAN IN

01:14:01.703 --> 01:14:02.771
THIS COUNTRY.

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:04.373
AND WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:06.208
HIM TO FUNCTION NOT ONLY IN THE

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:08.477
LARGER SOCIETY BUT EVEN WITHIN

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:10.012
THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY

01:14:10.078 --> 01:14:11.747
IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:13.315
FORTIES IN WHICH SHE LIVED.

01:14:13.382 --> 01:14:15.184
YET DESPITE THAT HE BECAME A

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:16.919
BELOVED FRIEND.

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:19.321
OF THURGOOD MARSHALL AND SO MANY

01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:20.789
OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS.

01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:22.791
BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT HE

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:24.893
WAS TRULY AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.562
IS TO BE A PERSON TOTALLY

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.530
COMMITTED TOOK EQUALITY AND

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:30.399
JUSTICE FOR EVERYONE.

01:14:30.465 --> 01:14:31.934
IT IS UNFORTUNATE BAYARD RUSTIN

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.468
OFTEN WAS IN THE BACKGROUND OF

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:35.103
MOVEMENTS WHETHER IT WAS THE

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:36.839
MARCH ON WASHINGTON OR VARIOUS

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:38.507
OTHER KINDS OF PROTEST.

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:39.741
HE'S STILL AT BUT AT THE SAME

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:41.343
TIME HE WASN'T AFRAID TO TELL

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:42.744
YOU WHO HE WAS.

01:14:42.811 --> 01:14:44.246
BUT HE RECOGNIZE IT PROBABLY HIS

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.315
PRESENCE IN A VERY VISIBLE SENSE

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:47.850
WOULD HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:49.618
ON THE MARCH HAD AN ADVERSE

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:50.986
EFFECT ON THE MOVEMENT.

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:54.456
AND SO HE VOLUNTARILY STEPPED

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:55.824
THIS TO TAKE THE FRONT SEAT

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:57.059
WHILE HE WORKED BEHIND THE

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:58.227
SCENES.

01:14:58.293 --> 01:15:00.062
HE IS TRULY A HERO IN EVERY

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:01.830
SENSE OF THE WORD HAVING

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:03.632
SACRIFICE AND SUFFERED THROUGH

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:05.334
MANY OF THE PROTEST THAT EXISTED

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.568
IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:09.671
HE DIED IN.

01:15:09.738 --> 01:15:10.205
NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AS A

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:13.108

BAD RUSTIN AS A QUAKER.

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:18.714
AND THEY SAID THE PRINCIPAL

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:21.149
FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCE HIS LIFE

01:15:21.216 --> 01:15:22.484

ALL PEOPLE ARE.

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:31.460
ONE WE HAVE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO

01:15:31.526 --> 01:15:33.695
HAVE MADE THE KIND OF SACRIFICE

01:15:33.762 --> 01:15:35.264
THAT BARED RUSTIN DID WITHOUT

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:36.932
DEMANDING ATTENTION WITHOUT

01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:38.700
DEMANDING THAT THINGS HAD TO BE

01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:39.635
A REFLECTION OF HIM.

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.403
