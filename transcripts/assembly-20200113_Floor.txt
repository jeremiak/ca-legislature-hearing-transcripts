MEMBERS PLEASE KEEP THE VOLUME LEVEL MANAGEABLE WE HAVE BUSINESS BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY TODAY MR STONE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED PART OF ME. THE CLERK READ THE RESOLUTION ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT REOLUTION ONE FORTY BY SOMETHING MEMBER MARK STONE AND OTHERS RELATIVE TO POSITIVE PARENTING AWARENESS MONTH MR STONE YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS WE HAVE PUT A GREAT DEAL OF FOCUS WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. THIS YEAR LAST YEAR ON THE EARLIEST IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE THE YOUNGEST IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT IS THOSE WHO ARE ZERO TO FIVE AND FOCUSING ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION ON WORKING ON EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND IN TRYING TO SHIFT THE FOCUS TO THOSE WHO NEED US THE MOST AND ESPECIALLY. FROM A- BUT IN THAT CONVERSATION BUT FORGET HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HELP THE PARENTS OUT AS WELL. WE CANNOT HEAL THE CHILD IF WE CANNOT HEAL THE FAMILY. AND THAT IS WHERE POSITIVE PARENTING COMES IN THERE ARE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS. IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE TRYING TO HELP. YOUNG PARENTS ESPECIALLY BUT OTHER PARENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED. TO BECOME BETTER PARENTS AND LEARN HOW TO BE THE PARENTS THAT PERHAPS THEIR PARENTS WORK BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS OF POVERTY. AND ADVERSE EXPERIENCES. ARE GENERATIONAL AD ARE CYCLIC. SO WHAT POSITIVE PARENTING MONTH IS INTENDED TO DO IS TO RAISE AWARENESS AND HOW THE CONVERSATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THESE PROGRAMS THEY GIVE TOOLS TO PARENTS. TO BECOME BETTER PARENTS. SOME PARENTS WHO HAD WERE NOT HELD THIS CHILDREN DON'T KNOW THAT SOMETIMES THE BEST THING THEY CAN DO IS TO HOLD THEIR CHILD READ TO THEIR CHILD. PROVIDE THAT BENEFIT POSITIVE PARENTING MONTH IS. TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAMS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND TO HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO FOSTER THESE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM.

RAISING CHILDREN COULD BE AS YOU ALL KNOW THAT OUR PARENTS ONE OF THE MOST REWARDING THINGS. ANYONE CAN EVER EXPERIENCE BUT AS A PARENT YOU ALSO KNOW. THEY CAN BE ONE OF THE MOST STRESSFUL THINGS A PERSON CAN EXPERIENCE. BUT FOR REASONS OF APPARENT WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICES. AND THE AND- MAKING- THE- THE RIGHT OR SENDING THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR THEIR CHILDREN. SO THIS RESOLUTION IT ENCOURAGES FAMILIES TO IMPLEMENT PROVEN POSITIVE PARENTING STRATEGIES. AND HIGHLIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITIES AS WAS MENTIONED- THAT CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED POSITIVE PARENTING HOPES TO GIVE CHILDREN. THE SKILLS THAT THEY NEED TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THEIR EMOTIONS CONFIDENT IN THEIR ABILITIES. I AM PREPARED TO BE OVERCOME ORDERS WILL PREPARE TO OVERCOME ANY OF LIFE'S ADVERSITIES THAT THEY MAY FACE. SO BUYING RIGID AND- NOT WHAT THE PARENTS BUT ALSO THOSE THAT OUR GRANDPARENTS OR CARE GIVERS. FOSTER PARENTS EVEN FAMILY MEMBERS TO CARE FOR A CHILD TO FOCUS ON POSITIVE POINTS TO BE HIT AND DON'T THE RELATIONSHIP. ON COMMUNICATION TO RESPECT WE CAN STRENGTHEN FAMILIES BONDS AS WELL RED.

MEMBERS PLEASE GIVE YOUR ATTENTION TO MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE THIS KAMLAGER-DOVE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. S. C. R. THIRTY ONE SEEKS TO HONOR WILLIE L. BROWN JUNIOR BY NAMING THE PUBLIC STREET CIRCLE AND PLAZA AT NINE FOURTEEN AND NINE FIFTEEN CAPITALMALL AS THE WILLIE L. BROWN JUNIOR CIRCLE IN PLAZA. MISTER BROWN IS WIDELY REGARDED AS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL POLITICIANS OF THE LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY. AND HAS BEEN AT THE CENTER OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT AND CIVIC LIFE FOR AN ASTOUNDING FIVE DECADES. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY MISTER BROWN MADE HISTORY WHEN HE BECAME THE pOF THIS BODY A ROLE HE HELD FOR A RECORD FIFTEEN YEARS. ALTHOUGH I HEAR SOMEONE IS CREEPING UP ON THAT. DURING HIS THIRTY YEAR TENURE AS AN ELECTED MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY MISTER BROWN LEFT HIS IMPRINT ON EVERY ASPECT OF PUBLIC POLICY IMPACTING THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SPECIFICALLY HIS LEADERSHIP RESULTED IN LEGISLATION THAT BANNED SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPONS GAINES STATE DIVESTMENT FROM SOUTH AFRICA AND CREATED STABILITY IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM THROUGH SCHOOL FINANCE REFORM FOLLOWING HIS MONUMENTAL ROLE AS SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY MISTER BROWN CONTINUED HIS GROUND BREAKING CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE AS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO WHERE HE SERVED TWO TERMS. AS MAYOR MR BROWN REFURBISHED AND REBUILD CALIFORNIA'S BUSIEST TRANSIT SYSTEM PIONEERED THE USE OF BOND MEASURES TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND CREATED A MODEL JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE JUST A BRIEF GLIMPSE OF THE VARIETY OF FORWARD THINKING POLICY IDEAS THAT WERE FULLY REALIZED UNDER BROWN'S LEADERSHIP. ESSIE OUR THIRTY ONE CELEBRATES THOSE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS WELL AS MISTER BROWN'S UNRELENTING DEDICATION TO A BETTER CALIFORNIA FOR ALL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS CAM LONGER DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I TO RISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS- IN SUPPORT OF S. C. R. THIRTY ONE DOUBLE READ THAT WILL RENAME A STREET IN A PLAZA TO THE WEST OF THE CAPITAL. OF AFTER MISTER WILLIE BROWN. AS CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA BLACK CAUCUS LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS WE ARE HONORED TO BASICALLY SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. FOR MISTER BROWN BECAUSE OF HIS LONGSTANDING COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO CALIFORNIA. THERE'S NO ONE MORE FITTING FOR THIS TRIBUTE TO GIVE OUT FOR US TO GIVE TO AN INDIVIDUAL THAN TO MISTER BROWN HIMSELF. WE KNOW THAT THE BAY BRIDGE IS NAMED AFTER HIM BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING MUCH MORE TANGIBLE AND VISIBLE FOR THE PEOPLE OF SACRAMENTO AND THOSE WHO COME TO VISIT THE CAPITAL. THEN TO THE TO HAVE SOMETHING NAMED AFTER MISTER BROWN. HIS TENURE IN THIS LEGISLATURE OBVIOUSLY IS LEGENDARY HE WILL HAVE THE LONGEST HISTORY BASED ON OUR LAWS AS THEY EXIST TODAY. THE LONGEST HISTORY BEING THE IN TERMS OF BEING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN WHO NOT ONLY THE AFRICAN AMERICAN BASICALLY BEING THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY. THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO BASICALLY BE SELECTED AS SPEAKER AND THERE'S BEEN THREE AND HE'S BEEN ONE OF THE THREE. THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT MOST OF US KNOW THAT- MISTER BROWN. WHO IS A LONGTIME FRIEND OF MY FAMILY. I KNEW HIM BEFORE HE WAS SPEAKER AND HE WAS BRILLIANT AND HE STILL IS BRILLIANT. HE'S A MASTER POLITICIAN HE WAS NOT ONLY A FRIEND TO DEMOCRATS BUT HE WAS ALSO A FRIEND TO REPUBLICANS. AND OFTEN SHOCKED FOLKS WHEN HE COULD GET THINGS DONE NOT ONLY WOULD DEMOCRATS BUT WOULD REPUBLICANS. HE ACTUALLY BECAME THE SPEAKER AS A RESULT OF HIS LONG STANDING RELATIONSHIP WITH REPUBLICANS IN THIS HOUSE. AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIM USED NOT ONLY SEE A MAN WHO BASICALLY. RAN THIS HOUSE BUT RAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HE WAS SO POWERFUL THAT THE ONLY WAY THEY COULD GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE WAS TO PASS A LAW TO LIMIT TERMS. BECAUSE OTHERWISE HE WOULD STILL BE HERE AS SPEAKER OF THIS ASSEMBLY. HE WAS JUST THAT POWERFUL OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHEN YOU THOUGHT MET WILLIE BROWN HE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT THE FUTURE. NOT WHAT WHAT'S BUT WHAT COULD BE. AND PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE% ACTUALLY WERE SECURE IN KNOWING THAT WHEN THINGS HAPPEN WILLIE WOULD HANDLE IT. AND HE COULD UP AND DOWN THE STATE HAMMER THE ISSUE IS THAT WHAT BEFORE SAYS. AS THE LEGISLATURE. WHEN I WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE IT WAS INTERESTING THAT EVERY TIME I TALK TO SOMEBODY. ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW WE WERE IN CRISIS AND THEY WOULD ALWAYS SAY BUT IT WILL IT WAS THERE. IT WOULDN'T BE THAT WAY. HE WOULD HAVE HANDLED IT HE WOULD HAVE DONE THIS A DONE THAT AND SO THAT WAS A HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS LEADERSHIP NOT ONLY. IN TERMS OF DEMOCRATS BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF REPUBLICANS. HE WAS A BI PARTISAN LEADER IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD. A MAN WHO WAS A MASTER AT POLITICS AND STILL IS TO THIS DAY. WHEN I GET A CALL IN IS FROM WILLIE BROWN I WAS THE ALL MY GOD. WHAT NOW DOES WILL THEY WANT AND HE STILL% BASICALLY TRYING TO CHANGE AND INFLUENCE LEGISLATION. AND PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE. WHILE HE'S SITTING IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE WOULD BE A BASICALLY HONOR TO NAME A STREET AFTER WILLIE BROWN. BECAUSE REALLY THIS IS A MAN WHO STARTED FROM BASICALLY VERY LITTLE. INTO IN TEXAS. AND BET AND WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH SCHOOL. WORK THIS WAY TO LAW SCHOOL. BASICALLY CLIMBED UP TO BECOME A LEGISLATOR. MADE BASICALLY FALSE UNHAPPY SOMETIMES OF THE DECISIONS THAT HE MADE. AND SHOCKED CALIFORNIA WHEN HE BECAME THE SPEAKER. SHOCKED CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF HOW HE BECAME SPEAKER WHILE THEY WERE FIGHTING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. WILLIE WAS WORKING HIS AGENDA. AND HE BECAME SPEAKER OF THIS HOUSE AND HE RAN THIS HOUSE ITH SOME DIGNITY AND FOCUS AND CALIFORNIA WAS STRONGER AND WE WILL BE STRONGER. AS A RESULT OF ALL THE THINGS HE'S DONE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. SB ARE THIRTY ONE. THE NAME OF THE STREET AFTER BROWN A LEADER WHO STARTED THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. WHO STARTED BAY PACKED THE BLACK AMERICAN POLITICAL ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF THE A. FOUNDERS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF. GLORIOUS HE HAS BASICALLY MADE STATE A POWERFUL STATE I WAS YES SUPPORT. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER YOUR COOLEY RECKON. WHAT COLLEAGUES I'M JUST THRILLED AND IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THINKING BACK TO THE TIME WHEN HE BECAME SPEAKER EARLY IN MY CAREER I LIVED IN THAT AARON SO THREE THINGS ARE JUST BUILT ABOUT WILLIE BROWN. ON HOW FAR HE TRAVELED IN HIS LIFE. BECAUSE I REMEMBER THE TIMES WHEN YOU HEAR WILLIE BROWN TELL THE STORY GROWING UP A CHILD IN BROWNSVILLE TEXAS. WHERE HE WOULD. TO MAKE ENDS MEET HE WOULD SHINE SHOES. AND IT WOULD TELL THE STORY OF THE LITTLE. BLACK BOY IN BROWNSVILLE TEXAS NEW CHINA ISSUES FOR THE RANCHERS AND THEN THEY WOULD THROW HIS PAYMENT IN THIS PLATOON. TO FOR SOME ON HIM THE INDIGNITY OF FISHING IS PAYMENT OUT OF ALL OF THAT IN THIS BOOK TO. AND SO YOU KNOW. JOKES ON THEM HOW FAR WILLIE BROWN WENT FROM BROWNSVILLE TEXAS I ALSO WANT TO KNOW TO JUST FOR THE MEMBERS HERE REFLECT UPON THIS LITTLE CIRCLE ACROSS THE STREET TO HONOR WILLIE BROWN THERE IS ACTUALLY NO PLACE IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA. THAT CONVEYS THE CENTER OF STATE GOVERNMENT. THE WAY TENTH AND WILLIE BROWN JUNIOR CIRCLE CONVEYS IT. DECADES OF PLANNING PROTECTED NOT CAPITOL MALL OUT OF THE TOWER BRIDGE THE LIBRARY OF COURSE BUILDING ON REBUILDING THE STATE CAPITAL THERE IS NO SPOT THE SUPERFINAL PERSONIFIES. THIS SITE OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNORS A SPOT WHICH WE NOW HONOR WILLIE AT. IN ON THIS FINAL NOTE THE BOTH MY COLLEAGUES EMPHASIZE THE COLLEGIALITY. YOU KNOW WHAT AN ERROR HE HAD BEEN A MEMBER FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS. WHEN IT BECAME SPEAKER FOR FIFTEEN YEARS HE HAD A UNPARALLELED QUALITY RELATIONSHIPS AROUND THE BODY WHICH IS VERY. AND MONITORING TO ALL OF US. BUT IT THIS EXAMPLEOF COLLEGIALITY AND THE IMPACT HE HAD WHEN LOMA PRIETA HIT. IN OCTOBER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND ARE FREEWAYS STARTED FALLING DOWN. SPEAKER WILLIE L. BROWN WITH KEN MADDY THE MINORITY LEADER. TAKING STOCK OF WHAT HAD HIT CALIFORNIA. DID A HANDSHAKE DEAL. THAT WE SHOULD JUST ADOPT THE ROUTE OF A SALES TAX FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME TO RAISE FUNDS RAPIDLY FOR THE REBUILDING OF CALIFORNIA AND HAVING STRUCK A HANDSHAKE DEAL WITH THE MINORITY LEADER IN THE SENATE. IT WAS QUICKLY EXECUTE. AND I THINK SO IT HONORS WILLING TO KIND OF SAY THAT WAS A CHOLERA READERSHIP HE HAS. BUT THAT TOO IS A MONITORING OF ALL OF US THE POWER. OF SERVING AS A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE. THE ABILITY OF COLLEAGUES TO BEND THE CURVE IN THE FUTURE WHEN NECESSARY BY CONCERTED ACTION WILLIE CERTAINLY EXEMPLIFIES THAT. BUT IS NOT JUST A THING TO BE HONORED WITH SORT OF A GUY POST AND OUR OWN LIVES SO GREAT TO HAVE THAT CIRCLE IN HONOR OF HIM GINGIVAL. THANK YOU MISS COOLEY SAYING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. ON THE RESOLUTION MS CAM WATER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES MISTER COOLEY AND DOCTOR WEBER.
