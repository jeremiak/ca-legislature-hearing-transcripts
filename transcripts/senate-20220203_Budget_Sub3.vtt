ACROSS THE WEST AROUND THE

00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:04.663
ROLLOUT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:05.897
ACT AND THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:08.133
LESSONS I THINK THAT WORK WELL

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.869
AS DEEPLY DEEPLY I AM DEAD IN

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:12.738
PARTNERSHIP WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:14.873
THE GROUND AND IN COMMUNITIES.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.075
AND I THINK WE KNOW THAT FOR

00:21:17.142 --> 00:21:18.744
SYSTEMS CHANGE WORK TO OCCUR IN

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.579
A MEANINGFUL WAY WE REALLY HAVE

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:23.582
TO CONNECT. STATE LEVEL POLICY

00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:25.150
FUNDING FRAMEWORKS WITH THE WORK

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:26.852
THAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND

00:21:26.918 --> 00:21:28.754
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE BI

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.188
DIRECTIONAL WORKING TOGETHER

00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:31.490
THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE APPROACH

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:34.292
THAT I TOOK AND TOOK TO THE WORK

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:36.361
ON THE ACA IMPLEMENTATION. AND I

00:21:36.428 --> 00:21:39.164
THINK ANOTHER IS THAT THERE HAVE

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:40.799
TO BE A WILLINGNESS TO STEP BACK

00:21:40.866 --> 00:21:42.000
AND LOOK AT WHAT'S WORKING AND

00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:43.502
MAYBE WHAT'S NOT AND WHAT COULD

00:21:43.568 --> 00:21:45.437
BE DIFFERENT IN ORDER TO REALLY

00:21:45.504 --> 00:21:46.605
CENTER THE CHANGE THAT WE'RE

00:21:46.672 --> 00:21:49.007
TRYING TO MAKE IN TERMS OF THE

00:21:49.074 --> 00:21:51.643
HEALTH AND WELL BEING. OF OUR-

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.111
OVER SERVING AND SO I THINK IN

00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:54.446
THIS CASE THAT REALLY GOES TO

00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:55.480
THE STATE TRAINING ON CHILDREN

00:21:55.547 --> 00:21:56.982
YOUTH AND FAMILIES. AND THEIR

00:21:57.049 --> 00:22:00.052
EXPERIENCES IN TERMS OF. AND

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:01.753
SUPPORTING THEIR WELLNESS AND

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.022
HOW WE- YOU KNOW I THINK SYSTEMS

00:22:04.089 --> 00:22:06.191
WERE CREATED IN SILOS OFTEN AND

00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:08.360
THAT IS THE CASE HERE AND WE

00:22:08.427 --> 00:22:10.762
HAVE WORK TO DO TO RE ORGANIZE

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:13.432
THOSE SYSTEMS IN A WAY THAT IS

00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:16.168
REALLY CENTURY. I'M THE NEEDS

00:22:16.234 --> 00:22:17.469
AND EXPERIENCES IN THE

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:18.904
PRIORITIES AND STRENGTHS OF

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.338
CHILDREN AND YOUTH I THINK WE

00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:21.406
CERTAINLY SAW THAT IN THE ACA

00:22:21.473 --> 00:22:24.676
WORK WHICH IS ACT I'M- IT'S

00:22:24.743 --> 00:22:27.112
REALLY CRITICAL CHIU FOCUSED ON

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.915
THE HUMAN LEVEL. WHAT PEOPLE'S

00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:32.117
NEEDS ARE IN ORDER TO ENGAGE

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:33.985
THEM AND SYSTEMS CHANGE WORK.

00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:35.787
AND THEN THE LAST OBSERVATION I

00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:37.689
WOULD TAKE IT IS THAT AND IT

00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:40.092
TAKES AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:43.128
COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP I

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:44.663
TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK THAT WAS

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.798
CERTAINLY THE CASE AND ARE WORK

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:49.034
AROUNDS THE ACA AND I THINK

00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:51.303
THAT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE HERE.

00:22:51.369 --> 00:22:52.404

SCHOOL SYSTEMS WERE A LOT OF

00:23:04.449 --> 00:23:07.052
THIS WORK WILL BE DONE AND IF WE

THE LEVEL I THINK WE WERE

THANK YOU THANK- NO IT REALLY SO

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.555
IT'S THE ISSUES IN TERMS OF

00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:07.423
PROTECT WHEN I COME TO THE API

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.859
COME. IS THAT WERE VERY LARGE TO

00:57:09.926 --> 00:57:11.194
HIGH SAID WE WERE A WEEK WE TO

IN THE WORLD AND LARGEST- OCEAN

00:57:15.064 --> 00:57:15.632
IN THE WORLD. AND SO OFTEN TIMES

00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:18.368
WHAT IS- IF WE DON'T DECIDE- WE

00:57:18.434 --> 00:57:23.640
ACTUALLY- AND FOR- HI TO ISSUE-

00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:25.241
THAT COME UP SO LET'S JUST TALK

00:57:25.308 --> 00:57:27.544
KOBE ACTUALLY- SO FOR. TO POINT

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:28.711
CENTER COMMUNITY HAS THE HIGH

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:31.781
DEATH RATE OF ANY RACIAL ETHNIC

00:57:31.848 --> 00:57:33.316
GROUPS. THAT WE JUST DO API

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:34.784
WASHED OUT OF IT. THAT'S

00:57:34.851 --> 00:57:36.052
INTERESTING IS WITH ABOUT WHEN

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:38.922
ACCESS- THERE'S SOME INDICATIONS

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:40.156
FOR EXAMPLE WELL ASIANS LOOK

00:57:40.223 --> 00:57:43.059
LIKE WE'RE DOING WE WOULD NOT DO

00:57:43.126 --> 00:57:45.662
AS POORLY- POLITICO BID BUT

00:57:45.728 --> 00:57:46.763
THERE'S BEEN SOME STUDIES

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:49.399
LOOKING AT. ASIAN TO ONLY SPEAK.

00:57:49.465 --> 00:57:51.134
THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE AND DON'T

00:57:51.201 --> 00:57:52.669
SPEAK ENGLISH ACTUALLY DO VERY

00:57:52.735 --> 00:57:54.070
POORLY. BUT IF YOU JUST WATCH IT

00:57:54.137 --> 00:57:55.438
ALL TOGETHER YOU KNOW EVERYTHING

00:57:55.505 --> 00:57:57.207
IS STILL DO YOU DON'T SEE THIS

00:57:57.273 --> 00:58:01.578
DISPARITIES. SO. CAN YOU JUST

00:58:01.644 --> 00:58:02.912
MAYBE SPEAK TO- DASHBOARD IN

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:04.447
TERMS OF THE AT. BE SURE THAT WE

00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:07.550
DISAGGREGATE. THE SO THAT WE CAN

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:09.986
IDENTIFY- DON'T THE THESE

00:58:10.053 --> 00:58:11.855
DISPARITIES WITHIN VARIOUS

00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:14.524
COMMUNITIES- AND AGAIN YOU KNOW

00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:16.125
THEY THINK AT THE OFTENTIMES WE

00:58:16.192 --> 00:58:18.228
TALK ABOUT- THE API COMMUNITY

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:19.696
UNFORTUNATELY EITHER TO AN H. P.

00:58:19.762 --> 00:58:21.898
I GET OVERALL HELLO HI HOW ARE

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:24.467
OR OTHER SUBGROUPS- GET MAST

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:26.369
WHEN THEY'RE ALL GROUPED

00:58:26.436 --> 00:58:30.139
TOGETHER. SO I WOULD SAY THAT

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:32.408
BAD ACTORS PROBABLY BETTER ONCE

00:58:32.475 --> 00:58:34.644
WE GOT OUR FRAMEWORK ON BY APRIL

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:36.112
WE WOULD HAVE AN IDEA THAT I

00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:38.915
THINK WHERE WHERE. I'M TRYING TO

00:58:38.982 --> 00:58:40.016
LEAD A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS

00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:41.951
RIGHT NOW IS. WHAT ARE WE

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:43.486
LOOKING TO ACHIEVE AND SO I

00:58:43.553 --> 00:58:45.255
THINK THAT'S HELPFUL AND THAT

00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:47.891
ADDITIONAL- INPUT IN TERMS OF

00:58:47.957 --> 00:58:49.826
THE END IN MIND. WHAT WE'RE

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:51.761
TRYING TO TRACK WILL ALLOW US TO

00:58:51.828 --> 00:58:55.598
PROBABLY BETTER PLAN OUR EFFORTS

00:58:55.665 --> 00:58:57.667
SO. WE WANT TO HAVE A TOOL.

00:58:57.734 --> 00:59:01.471
NUMBER ENOUGH. TO BE ABLE TO-

00:59:01.537 --> 00:59:03.806
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT- TO BE

00:59:03.873 --> 00:59:05.975
ABLE TO DRILL AND- TO THAT

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:09.579
CERTAIN POPULATIONS AND- I THINK

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:11.080
THAT'S- PROBABLY THE BEST ANSWER

00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:13.383
I CAN GIVE YOU AT THIS POINT.

00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:16.486
REPLY THIS INVOLVES I THINK THIS

00:59:16.552 --> 00:59:17.320
IS OF COURSE VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:19.889
THE API COMMUNITY AND- OF COURSE

00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:21.090
ALSO TO BE SURE WE GET ACTED

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:22.725
INFORMATION I DO APPRECIATE FOR

00:59:22.792 --> 00:59:25.361
EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR- IF YOU'RE

00:59:25.428 --> 00:59:26.396
A FACULTY BUDGET WOULD PUT IN

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:30.166
SOME FUNDING- FOR. UCW FORM SOME

00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:31.067
VERY IMPORTANT SOCIAL SERVICE

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:33.002
RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY THE

00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:34.137
DIFFERENT NEEDS OF DIFFERENT

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:35.405
SUBGROUPS IN THE API CAN

00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:37.206
HOPEFULLY THAT. CAN HELP

00:59:37.273 --> 00:59:40.510
CONTRIBUTE TO. YOUR- TO HAVING A

00:59:40.576 --> 00:59:41.878
DASHBOARD THAT ACTUALLY WOULD BE

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:44.948
ABLE TO IDENTIFY- INEQUITIES AND

00:59:45.014 --> 00:59:49.519
BEEN VERY DIFFERENT POPULATIONS

00:59:49.585 --> 00:59:52.422
. ABSOLUTELY JUST THE L. G. B.

00:59:52.488 --> 00:59:55.191
T. HAS HISTORICALLY A- AN ISSUE

00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:56.659
WITH THIS OFTENTIMES NOT BEING

00:59:56.726 --> 00:59:58.394
COUNTED AND SOMETIMES IT FEELS

00:59:58.461 --> 01:00:00.196
LIKE EVEN WHEN WE- IN THE

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:01.397
LEGISLATURE HAS ASKED FOR

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:03.933
INFORMATION ON PASSED BILLS. BY

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.035
THE DATA STILL IS NOT COLLECTED.

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:09.439
SO WHAT APPROACH IS ARE YOU ARE

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:11.507
YOU TAKING ON TO THINK ABOUT- IT

01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:12.608
ESPECIALLYSINCE A SEXUAL

01:00:12.675 --> 01:00:14.544
ORIENTATION BILL TO BE TAKE

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:15.611
COMMUNICANTS ACROSS ALL OF

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:17.246
THESE. DEMOGRAPHICS THAT YOU'RE

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:18.982
TALKING ABOUT HOW ARE YOU GOING

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:20.750
TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:22.785
PARTICULAR ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED.

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:23.853
WITH SOMETIMESPEOPLE DON'T SELF

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.290
REPORT- THEIR IDENTITY YEAH I

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:28.558
THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION IT'S

01:00:28.624 --> 01:00:29.859
ACTUALLY THE WHEN WE THINK OF

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:31.361
INEQUITY DASH FOR THE FIRST

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:32.929
OUTWARD WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:34.864
WITH OUR TEAM IS THE DASHBOARD

01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:37.367
THAT ADDRESSES THE MISSING DATA-

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:39.102
WE KNOW THAT AS WE TRY TO BRING

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:40.503
A PERSON CENTRED VIEW AND BRING

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:42.138

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:45.241
DIFFERENT APARTMENTS QUITE

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:46.642
DIFFERENT DATA SOME DATA IS NOT

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:47.844
COLLECTED AT ALL SO

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.879
UNDERSTANDING. GAP START TO THEN

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:52.415
IN OUR SERVICE DELIVERY EFFORTS.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:55.151
TO FIND EITHER WAYS TO OBTAIN

THAT DATA OR BUILD INTO SERVICE

01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:01.591

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:12.448
WHICH MEANS EVERYONE'S

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.783
EXCHANGING DATA WITH EACH OTHER

01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:15.885
THAT'S GOOD- BUT ALSO WE WANT TO

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:17.320
BE SURE THAT SOMEONE CAN'T TAP

01:04:17.386 --> 01:04:20.590
INTO THE EXCHANGES WHO SHOULDN'T

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:22.458
BE. AND- AND THEN TO DOUBLE DOWN

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.493
PUBLIC CONFIDENCE SO- HE TALK

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.329
ABOUT PERHAPS SOME OF THE STEPS.

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:28.764
BEING TAKEN TO ENSURE DATA

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:30.833
SECURITY AND THE FRAMEWORK. OR

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.435
EXCHANGING DATA THEN ON THE FLIP

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:34.604
SIDE THOUGH- TALK ABOUT MONEY

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:37.306
GET GREATER ACCESS TO DATA- YOU

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:38.307
KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:40.042
THAT WE'VE LEARNED IN KOBE-

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:42.011
PERHAPS IS THAT. BEING SURE

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:43.879
PUBLIC HEALTH ACTUALLY AS ACCESS

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.848
TO A LARGER AMOUNTS OF DATA TO

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.216
BETTER DO SURVEILLANCE AND

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.318
IDENTIFY YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:52.688
UPCOMING. HAZARDS OR OR BETTER

01:04:52.755 --> 01:04:54.156
MANAGING EXISTING ONES LIKE

01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:56.659
COATED OR OTHERS. AND SO WHAT

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.894
ARE WE DOING TO ALSO ENSURE

01:04:58.961 --> 01:05:03.332
THAT- PUBLIC HEALTH. HAS IT HAS

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:05.568
THE- BUT ACCESS BUT ALSO THE

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:08.070
RESOURCES TO ANALYZE DATA THAT

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:08.771
MIGHT BE COMING THROUGH THE

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:10.473
EXCHANGE. SO I REALIZE THAT

01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:11.674
MAYBE POINT TO DIFFERENT

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:14.176
DIRECTIONS BUT- WANTED SECURITY

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:15.645
THE OTHER ONE IS YOU KNOW MAKING

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:17.046
SURE THAT ON A POPULATION BASIS

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:19.148
WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:23.252
OF THIS DATA TO PROTECT PUBLIC.

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:24.487
SURE AND I WILL SAY ON A

01:05:24.553 --> 01:05:25.454
PERSONAL LEVEL WATCHING THE

01:05:25.521 --> 01:05:27.290
HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE GROW

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:28.824
OVER THE LAST TWELVE OR THIRTEEN

01:05:28.891 --> 01:05:30.893
YEARS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE- AND

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.728
ALSO FOCUSING A LOT OF MY CAREER

01:05:32.795 --> 01:05:37.166
ON. HELPING BRING SOCIAL-SERVICES TO. BUT THE INFORMATION

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:38.734
SHARING AS WELL AND LOOK AT THE

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:41.203
SOCIAL TERMS. IT'S EXCITING TO

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:43.939
SEE THE STATE. AT THIS POINT-

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:45.241
WHAT WHAT I THINK WE'RE

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:47.443
LEVERAGING IN THIS APPROACH AND

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.211
THE BEAUTY BEHIND IT IS THERE

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:50.780
ARE SO MANY ALL ALREADY EXISTING

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:52.248
HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES

01:05:52.315 --> 01:05:53.015
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:54.850
CALIFORNIA. AND REALLY WHAT THIS

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:57.553
IS LEVERAGING THOSE- AND THE

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.988
WORD YOU MIGHT HEAR OVER TIME

01:05:59.055 --> 01:06:00.656
IT'S INTERMEDIARIES WHICH ARE

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:01.924
THESE ENTITIES THAT ALREADY IN

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:03.326
THE BUSINESS OF. HEALTH

01:06:03.392 --> 01:06:05.328
INFORMATION EXCHANGES THROUGHOUT

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:08.064
THE STATE. THAT MAN CANNOT ON

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:12.401
BOARD- ENTITIES PROVIDERS- OTHER

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:14.136
ORGANIZATIONS THAT MIGHT NOT BE

01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:15.771
FAMILIAR WITH THE EXCHANGE OF

01:06:15.838 --> 01:06:17.807
HEALTH INFORMATION TO YOUR POINT

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:20.376
OF UNDERSTANDING THE SECURITY.

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:22.978
AND THE AND- THAT AFTER THAT

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:23.913
HAPPENS THERE. SO IT'S REALLY A

01:06:23.979 --> 01:06:28.718
NETWORK. OF NETWORK APPROACH-

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:29.485
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE STILL

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:31.420
TECHNO NOT MOST FOR SPIKE IT

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:33.122
DOES NOT- BUILDING. IT'S REALLY

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:36.759
INTO HAT A FRAMEWORK AND- DRUG

01:06:56.278 --> 01:06:58.547
MINIMUM LEVEL SECURITY TO ENSURE

01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:00.049
THAT SOMEONE NOW I CAN ACCESS

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:01.584

ARE LEAKING OUT THE OTHER SIDE

01:49:39.906 --> 01:49:40.440
BECAUSE THE WORKING CONDITIONS

01:49:40.507 --> 01:49:43.076
ARE GREAT. THE PAYS TOO LOW IT'S

01:49:43.143 --> 01:49:44.711

CATCH UP AND THEN ALSO TO ADVISE

01:49:46.613 --> 01:49:48.048
OTHER DEPARTMENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:49:56.623 --> 01:49:57.524
AT THE LEVEL THAT WILL HELP

01:49:57.590 --> 01:50:00.060
RETAIN THEM. THOSE ARE THE- DOES

01:50:00.126 --> 01:50:01.394
EACH KIND OF LOOK THE HOUSE IS

01:50:01.461 --> 01:50:02.395
CONSIDERING THOSE TYPES OF

01:50:02.462 --> 01:50:04.331
ANALYSES AS WELL SO IT'S

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:05.265
CERTAINLY IT'S GREAT TO FOCUS ON

01:50:05.332 --> 01:50:07.334
PIPELINE ON WORKFORCE BUT THIS

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.635
ALSO RETENTION. YOU KNOW YOU I

01:50:08.702 --> 01:50:10.003

01:50:12.605 --> 01:50:13.707
KNOW WE COULD LOSE A LOT OF OUR

01:50:13.773 --> 01:50:15.442
WORK FORCE THAT AY TOO AND IT

01:50:15.508 --> 01:50:16.443
AND I THINK THERE'S OTHER OTHER

01:50:16.509 --> 01:50:17.210
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WELL

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:18.545

ORDERS TIED THOSE TYPES OF

01:50:23.116 --> 01:50:30.523
ANALYSES- BEING CONSIDERED BY.

01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:31.324
EACH TIME WHEN IT LOOKS AT WORK

01:50:31.391 --> 01:50:32.559
FORCE. ABSOLUTELY CENTER PANS SO

01:50:32.625 --> 01:50:33.593
FAR OF THE RE. DATA CENTER AND-

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:35.395
THE BUDGET. THERE WAS. IN A ONE

01:50:35.462 --> 01:50:37.197
THIRD THREE LEFT YEAR INCLUDES.

AS AS I NOTED. INCREASED DATA

01:50:38.865 --> 01:50:40.266
FROM THE LICENSING BOARD SO WE

01:50:40.333 --> 01:50:42.369
NEED TO. HAVE BETTER SUPPLY SIDE

01:50:42.435 --> 01:50:45.305
DATA A DEMAND DATA. SO WE- GOT

01:50:45.372 --> 01:50:46.840
THAT MATT MEDICAL BOARD IS DONE

01:50:46.906 --> 01:50:48.408
THE BEST OF THE SIXTEEN OR

01:50:48.475 --> 01:50:50.176
EIGHTEEN- HEALING ARTS LICENSING

01:50:50.243 --> 01:50:51.778

RETIREMENT PLANS- CLINICAL HOURS

01:50:57.684 --> 01:50:59.285
BECAUSE WE NEED TO NOT JUST LOOK

01:50:59.352 --> 01:51:00.720
AT HOW MANY. PROVIDERS WE HAVE

01:51:00.787 --> 01:51:02.288

YOU THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR

BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THE

01:59:35.301 --> 01:59:38.404
CASE I GUESS YOU KNOW WHICH IS

01:59:38.471 --> 01:59:39.705
ONE OF MY PET PEEVES THAT WE

01:59:39.772 --> 01:59:40.540
DON'T HAVE. PROTECTION AROUND

01:59:40.606 --> 01:59:41.807
THAT TITLE SO WHEN WE SAY

01:59:41.874 --> 01:59:42.975
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SOCIAL

01:59:43.042 --> 01:59:44.610

01:59:55.454 --> 01:59:57.089
PROCESS WE CAN MAKE SOME CHANGES

01:59:57.156 --> 01:59:58.891
IN THAT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN.

01:59:58.958 --> 02:00:00.192
ABLE TO DO THAT IN THE

02:00:00.259 --> 02:00:01.327
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE I THINK

02:00:01.394 --> 02:00:02.795
YOU'RE CORRECT IF WE'RE TALKING

02:00:02.862 --> 02:00:04.230
ABOUT SOCIAL WORKERS AND IT IS

02:00:04.297 --> 02:00:06.732
IT IS A- PROFESSION. THAT THEN

02:00:06.799 --> 02:00:08.200
WE SHOULD ACTUALLY HIRE PEOPLE

02:00:08.267 --> 02:00:10.169
WHO HAVE RECEIVED DEGREES IN

02:00:10.236 --> 02:00:12.371
THAT PROFESSION- AND ALONG THAT

02:00:12.438 --> 02:00:14.974
LINE I THINK I JUST DESPICABLE.

02:00:15.041 --> 02:00:16.909

02:00:16.976 --> 02:00:18.244
FINE PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT WE'RE

02:00:18.311 --> 02:00:21.480

02:00:33.793 --> 02:00:34.994
THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MSW

WE HAVE VIRTUALLY INCREDIBLY

02:00:41.734 --> 02:00:44.337
SMALL MSW PROGRAM AND A VERY BIG

02:00:44.403 --> 02:00:47.807
BSW PROGRAM. BECAUSE OF COURSE

02:00:47.873 --> 02:00:49.041
IT'S MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE TO.

02:00:49.108 --> 02:00:51.277
HAVE A- BSW PROGRAM THAN AN MSW

02:00:51.344 --> 02:00:53.179
PROGRAM BUT THAT PUT THE QUEUE

02:00:53.245 --> 02:00:55.648
TO IMPACT THAN ON OUR SYSTEM SO

02:00:55.715 --> 02:00:57.950
WHEN WE SAY WE HAVE TO INCREASE

02:00:58.017 --> 02:00:58.417
ENROLLMENT AT SCHOOLS

02:00:58.484 --> 02:01:00.853
OFTENTIMES. IN ORDER TO DO THAT

02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:02.855
AND MAKE THE BUDGET WE DO THAT

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:04.056
WITH THE- THE LESS EXPENSIVE

02:01:04.123 --> 02:01:05.958
PROGRAM WHICH IS NOT MEETING OUR

02:01:06.025 --> 02:01:08.427
NEEDS SO I WOULD JUST BRING THAT

02:01:08.494 --> 02:01:09.328
TO YOUR ATTENTION WHEN WE'RE

02:01:09.395 --> 02:01:10.363
TALKING ABOUT INCREASING THAT.

02:01:10.429 --> 02:01:11.631

02:01:11.697 --> 02:01:13.499
ABOUT FUNDING THE PROGRAMS

02:01:13.566 --> 02:01:14.934
BECAUSE THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS

02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:16.602
PEOPLE GET A BSW. THEN THEY GO

02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:19.605
TO- AND PROGRAMS MOST IN THE

02:01:19.672 --> 02:01:22.742
WORLD. AND GET AN MSW THAT

PERHAPS. WE WOULD LICENSE IN THE

02:01:24.677 --> 02:01:27.213
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO JUST

02:01:27.279 --> 02:01:29.115
SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT. WHEN WE USE

02:01:29.181 --> 02:01:30.516
LANGUAGE LIKE THAT AND I DIDN'T

02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:32.184

WE USE THAT WORD WITHOUT REALLY.

02:01:35.588 --> 02:01:37.289
MEANING OF THAT WORD. I'M SO

02:01:37.356 --> 02:01:38.624
THIS MIGHT BE A VERY GOOD TIME

02:01:38.691 --> 02:01:39.458
TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE

02:01:39.525 --> 02:01:40.826
TALKING ABOUT INCREASING OUR

02:01:40.893 --> 02:01:42.595

02:01:52.605 --> 02:01:57.910
HOW I THINK HOW WE BURN PEOPLEOUT. VERY QUICKLY- I WILL START

02:01:57.977 --> 02:02:00.946

ROLES IS GOING TO BE IN JAIL

02:02:27.373 --> 02:02:30.543
GIVEN THE FACT THAT THEIR- NOW

02:02:30.609 --> 02:02:31.644
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE FAIRLY

02:02:31.711 --> 02:02:33.579

PARSE OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF

02:02:53.399 --> 02:02:55.434

FORCE MIGHT BE MOST HELPFUL IN

02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:31.871
MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE IS

02:03:31.937 --> 02:03:34.707

TRYING TO GET THE BEHAVIORAL

02:03:46.452 --> 02:03:49.188
HEALTH COACH ROLE RIGHT SO. I

02:03:49.255 --> 02:03:53.292
DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE A- YOU.

02:03:53.359 --> 02:03:55.661
ARE THAT WAY WHAT THE EXACT WILL

02:03:55.728 --> 02:03:57.997
WILL BE BUT WE HAVE BEEN- BUSILY

02:03:58.063 --> 02:04:00.366
ENGAGED. IN LOOKING MODELS AND-

02:04:00.432 --> 02:04:01.667
WITH STATE CALL. AND ALL I'LL

02:04:01.734 --> 02:04:04.436

ON PSYCHIATRY AND SOCIAL WORKERS. THERE'S A PROPOSED MANY

02:04:13.345 --> 02:04:14.847
JESSICA I KNOW HER DAD OKAY I

02:04:14.914 --> 02:04:15.815
WAS SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE WILL

02:04:15.881 --> 02:04:17.349
FOLLOW UP ON THAT JUST YET WE DO

02:04:17.416 --> 02:04:19.051
HAVE SEPARATE PROGRAMS FOR THAT

02:04:19.118 --> 02:04:21.387
WE HAVE AN EXISTING PROGRAM FOR-

02:04:21.453 --> 02:04:22.822
EXPANDING TRAINING AROUND

02:04:22.888 --> 02:04:24.089
PSYCHIATRY. OKAY I'M AND THEN

02:04:24.156 --> 02:04:25.491
WE'RE DEVELOPING A NEW PROGRAM

02:04:25.558 --> 02:04:27.426
AROUND BUILDING CAPACITY TO

02:04:27.493 --> 02:04:29.295
TRAIN US SOCIAL WORKERS OKAY SO

02:04:29.361 --> 02:04:30.963
YOU'LL GET BACK IN TERMS OF

02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:34.466
EXACTLY HOW MUCH GOES IN EACH.

02:04:34.533 --> 02:04:36.569
OKAY AND- I KNOW PEOPLE LIKE THE

02:04:36.635 --> 02:04:37.169
- PRACTICE AT THE TOP OF THE

02:04:37.236 --> 02:04:38.971
LICENSE BUT WE HAVE TO BE SURE

02:04:39.038 --> 02:04:40.272
THAT SKILLS AND WHAT IS THE

02:04:40.339 --> 02:04:41.874
TOPIC LICENSE PLATES THE MEANS

02:04:41.941 --> 02:04:45.578
SO- I THINK WITH A- LITTLE MORE

02:04:45.644 --> 02:04:48.047
CAREFUL ABOUT. USING THAT TIME

02:04:48.113 --> 02:04:49.782
TERMINOLOGY. BUT YEAH AND DID

02:04:49.849 --> 02:04:52.384
PRECIADO ANY BACK- IN THE END WE

02:04:52.451 --> 02:04:54.620
DON'T YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM IS I

02:04:54.687 --> 02:04:56.522
DON'T WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO.

02:04:56.589 --> 02:04:58.190
EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE

02:04:58.257 --> 02:04:59.191
HAVE A SHORTAGE IN THE

02:04:59.258 --> 02:05:01.093
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE SO

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:02.161
SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY WELL IN THE

02:05:02.228 --> 02:05:03.329
SHORTAGE. SOMETHING'S BETTER

02:05:03.395 --> 02:05:05.898
THAN NOTHING BUT THAT DOES THAT

02:05:05.965 --> 02:05:06.799
THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN

02:05:06.866 --> 02:05:09.969
SOMETHING IS. BE THE BEST OR

02:05:10.035 --> 02:05:13.806
EVEN GOOD RIGHT SO- AND YOU KNOW

02:05:13.873 --> 02:05:14.506
THAT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE

02:05:14.573 --> 02:05:16.709
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE A HUGE

02:05:16.775 --> 02:05:17.376
DEMAND AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION

02:05:17.443 --> 02:05:19.345
WITH THE MAN BEFORE. YOU KNOW

02:05:19.411 --> 02:05:20.679
YOU TRY TO STRETCH THE PEOPLE WE

02:05:20.746 --> 02:05:23.282
HAVE BUT AT SOME POINT TIME YOU

02:05:23.349 --> 02:05:24.583
HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT- JUST

02:05:24.650 --> 02:05:26.352
BECAUSE THEY SAW SOMEBODY.

02:05:26.418 --> 02:05:28.220
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT

02:05:28.287 --> 02:05:30.689
SOMEBODY HAS THE CAPACITY OR THE

02:05:30.756 --> 02:05:32.424
SKILLS OR TRAINING. TO DELIVER

02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:34.159
THE KIND OF CARE THAT WOULD BE

02:05:34.226 --> 02:05:35.928
BEST FOR THAT PERSON. AND MAYBE

02:05:35.995 --> 02:05:37.196
BETTER THAN NOTHING BUT TAT'S

02:05:37.263 --> 02:05:38.964
STILL YOU KNOW INSPECTION WE

02:05:39.031 --> 02:05:40.633
START TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW

02:05:40.699 --> 02:05:42.201
WHO FALLS INTO THAT CAMP RATE SO

02:05:42.268 --> 02:05:43.669
IT'S USUALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE

02:05:43.736 --> 02:05:45.237
DISADVANTAGED TO GET. THAT

02:05:45.304 --> 02:05:46.805
CETERA WHO END UP FINDING

02:05:46.872 --> 02:05:49.541
THEMSELVES THE SHORTS HANDSTAND

02:05:49.608 --> 02:05:50.476
STICKS OH NO YOU GOT TAKEN CARE

02:05:50.542 --> 02:05:52.111
OF. HE SAID YOU GOT TO SEE

02:05:52.177 --> 02:05:54.580
SOMEBODY. DIED WE GET IT WE

02:05:54.647 --> 02:05:55.881
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT TRYING TO

02:05:55.948 --> 02:05:57.316
GET ACCESS TO THE APPROPRIATELY

02:05:57.383 --> 02:05:59.485
TRAINED PERSON. NOT JUST ANYBODY

02:05:59.551 --> 02:06:01.587
AND- I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT

02:06:01.654 --> 02:06:02.354
YOU'RE ATTENTION IS. AND

02:06:02.421 --> 02:06:03.255
CERTAINLY I THINK THERE IS A

02:06:03.322 --> 02:06:04.723
PLACE IN A ROLE FOR THESE

02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:06.492
COACHES AND COUNSELORS. BUT ALSO

02:06:06.558 --> 02:06:07.860
RECOGNIZE AND THAT IS MENTAL

02:06:07.927 --> 02:06:09.828
HEALTH IS COMPLEX IT'S NOT EASY

02:06:09.895 --> 02:06:12.298
TAKE CARE OF. SKY CONDITION AND

02:06:12.364 --> 02:06:14.667
SO- WE NEED TO BE SURE WE HAVE

02:06:14.733 --> 02:06:17.937
ENOUGH QUALIFIED PEOPLE. ARE

02:06:18.003 --> 02:06:21.373
AVAILABLE TO TAKE CARE OF.

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:22.675
OFTENTIMES COMPLEX SITUATIONS.

02:06:22.741 --> 02:06:23.475
IN A MINUTE I WANTED IT ALL

02:06:23.542 --> 02:06:25.210
DEPENDED AND PUT TENSION ON ON

02:06:25.277 --> 02:06:27.646
BOTH SIDES BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE

02:06:27.713 --> 02:06:29.915
ALL. WE NEED WE NEED TO HAVE

02:06:29.982 --> 02:06:33.452
THAT. THAT VERY EDUCATED IN AND

02:06:33.519 --> 02:06:34.386
PREPARED WORK FORCE BUT WE ALSO

02:06:34.453 --> 02:06:35.888
NEED TO HAVE. A PEOPLE WITH A

02:06:35.955 --> 02:06:37.289
LOT OF LIFE EXPERIENCE OUT THERE

02:06:37.356 --> 02:06:39.224
AS WELL AND SO AND THEN I THINK

02:06:39.291 --> 02:06:40.059
WE'VE ALL BEEN OUT PROGRAMS AND

02:06:40.125 --> 02:06:41.727
SING. GREAT EXAMPLES OF PROMOTE

02:06:41.794 --> 02:06:44.196
TORTOISE AND NAVIGATORS AND ALL

02:06:44.263 --> 02:06:45.531
KINDS OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT SO

02:06:45.597 --> 02:06:46.265
THAT IS PART OF THE FULL

02:06:46.332 --> 02:06:47.733
CONTINUUM AND I THINK. I THINK

02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:49.401
THE EXCITING THING ABOUT WHAT

02:06:49.468 --> 02:06:51.136
WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. IS WE ARE

02:06:51.203 --> 02:06:52.571
NOT JUST LOOKING AT ONE PART OR

02:06:52.638 --> 02:06:54.406

02:06:54.473 --> 02:06:56.208

02:06:57.443 --> 02:06:59.244
THAT THE SOONER WE GET PEOPLE

AND IF THEY'RE YOUNG. THAT

02:07:00.412 --> 02:07:02.648
SOONER THAN LATER. THERE ARE

02:07:02.715 --> 02:07:05.551

THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRAINED TO BE

02:21:27.078 --> 02:21:28.246
ABLE TO DELIVER- BECAUSE WE

02:21:28.313 --> 02:21:29.280

02:21:29.347 --> 02:21:30.715

INVESTMENT AND- THE WORK FORCE

02:27:26.270 --> 02:27:27.705
AND I WOULD MAKE NOTES- AND

02:27:27.772 --> 02:27:31.008
BACKGROUND MATERIAL. THAT

02:27:31.075 --> 02:27:33.144
THERE'S A FORECASTED REDUCTIONS

02:27:33.211 --> 02:27:37.114
IN. PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS.

02:27:37.181 --> 02:27:39.584
1025% BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE

02:27:39.650 --> 02:27:42.386
WE HAVE FEWER PEOPLE ENTERING IN

02:27:42.453 --> 02:27:44.989
AS PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS- THEN

02:27:45.056 --> 02:27:46.857
THE ONES ARE PROJECTED RETIRE.

02:27:46.924 --> 02:27:51.229
AND SO I THINK- WE MIGHT WANT TO

02:27:51.295 --> 02:27:53.197
THINK ABOUT WHAT SO WE DO HAVE

02:27:53.264 --> 02:27:54.398
PROGRAMS LIKE SONG BROWN AND SO

02:27:54.465 --> 02:27:56.834
FORTH BUT I THINK. THERE'S AN

02:27:56.901 --> 02:27:58.836
ISSUE THERE AND I THINK WE NEED

02:27:58.903 --> 02:27:59.770
TO RECONSIDER SOME OF THE

02:27:59.837 --> 02:28:01.706
POLICIES THAT THE VALUE PRIMARY

02:28:01.772 --> 02:28:03.507

02:28:03.574 --> 02:28:05.476
UNFORTUNATELY. THE SIGNALS AND

02:28:05.543 --> 02:28:07.311
SET AND- MEDICAL STUDENTS ARE

02:28:07.378 --> 02:28:09.647
PAYING ATTENTION. AND WE NEED TO

02:28:09.714 --> 02:28:11.515
REVERSE THOSE IF YOU WANT TO-

02:28:11.582 --> 02:28:13.351
BRING BACK PRIMARY CARE

02:28:13.417 --> 02:28:15.586
PHYSICIANS TO CALIFORNIA. SO

02:28:15.653 --> 02:28:18.022
HOPEFULLY WE WILL- THINK ABOUT

02:28:18.089 --> 02:28:19.624
CONSIDER THAT BUT WE ALSO WANT

02:28:19.690 --> 02:28:21.959
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN TRY TO

02:28:22.026 --> 02:28:23.194
DO TO BOLSTER THAT THAT

02:28:23.261 --> 02:28:27.031
WORKFORCE- THE OTHER. ISSUE ALSO

02:28:27.098 --> 02:28:28.432
CITING AND KNOWS THAT IN THE

02:28:28.499 --> 02:28:31.135
CATEGORY PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS-

02:28:31.202 --> 02:28:33.938
RESIDENCIES ARE. FOR PHYSICIANS.

02:28:34.005 --> 02:28:36.240
SO MAYBE IT'S PROBABLY BEST TO

02:28:36.307 --> 02:28:37.675
CLASSIFY THESE AS POSTGRADUATE

02:28:37.742 --> 02:28:40.478
ARE- TRAINING OR WHATEVER SO-

02:28:40.544 --> 02:28:41.479
CERTAINLY THERE'S A VERY

02:28:41.545 --> 02:28:43.114
IMPORTANT ROLE FOR PSYCHIATRIC

02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:43.781

NURSES. BUT IT'S A LITTLE

02:28:46.484 --> 02:28:48.152
CONFUSING WHEN THE TERM WHEN THE

02:28:48.219 --> 02:28:49.754
TITLE PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS AND

02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:51.289
WE'RE MIXING AGAIN MIXING UP

02:28:51.355 --> 02:28:52.990
DIFFERENT TYPES OF. PEOPLE IN

02:28:53.057 --> 02:28:54.692
THAT CATEGORY SO IT MIGHT BE

02:28:54.759 --> 02:28:56.427
HELPFUL TO ACTUALLY BREAK OUT.

02:28:56.494 --> 02:28:58.529
HOW MUCH OF THE RESOURCES ARE

02:28:58.596 --> 02:29:00.498

02:29:00.564 --> 02:29:02.400
WHICH PARTICULAR PROFESSIONALS.

02:29:02.466 --> 02:29:03.934
BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT

02:29:04.001 --> 02:29:05.636
RULES AND DIFFERENT PLACES. YEAH

02:29:05.703 --> 02:29:07.538

EXACTLY SAID SO TO BE HELPFUL TO

02:29:11.976 --> 02:29:13.978
BREAK SOME OF THAT OUT BECAUSE

02:29:14.045 --> 02:29:17.014
THIS IS A PRETTY CERVANTES ONCE

02:29:17.081 --> 02:29:18.115
. THE TWELVE MONTHS OF FUNDING.

02:29:18.182 --> 02:29:19.650
THAT THE NEXT PROFESSIONALS. AND

02:29:19.717 --> 02:29:21.052
I THINK- PER THAT AGAIN WE

PROPOSAL- WE GENERALLY FIND THAT

02:32:32.576 --> 02:32:34.278
THIS PROPOSAL IS CURRENTLY AT A

02:32:34.345 --> 02:32:36.680
VERY CONCEPTUAL STAGE AND SHE

02:32:36.747 --> 02:32:38.282
DETAILS WILL NEED TO BE FLUSHED

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:40.150
OUT DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS.

02:32:40.217 --> 02:32:41.385
ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED

02:32:41.452 --> 02:32:42.953
THAT YOU GENERALLY A SHORTAGE OF

02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:44.288
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS EXIST

02:32:44.355 --> 02:32:45.856
ESPECIALLY ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC

02:32:45.923 --> 02:32:48.592
REGIONS- AND THIS PROPOSAL MAY

02:32:48.659 --> 02:32:49.660
HELP TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE

02:32:49.727 --> 02:32:51.495
SHORTAGES YEAH WE GENERALLY FIND

02:32:51.562 --> 02:32:53.364
THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BENEFIT

02:32:53.430 --> 02:32:55.199
FROM A CLEAR PROBLEM DEFINITION

02:32:55.266 --> 02:32:57.902
OF WHAT THE SPECIFIC WORKFORCE

02:32:57.968 --> 02:32:59.703
GAPS IT AIMS TO ADDRESS OUR-

02:32:59.770 --> 02:33:01.672
THIS COULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE

02:33:01.739 --> 02:33:03.107
DEVELOPING A TARGET NUMBER OF

02:33:03.173 --> 02:33:05.109
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO BE ADDED

02:33:05.175 --> 02:33:06.610
AND CLEARLY COMMUNICATING HOW

CLOSE THIS PROPOSAL WOULD GET US

02:33:08.412 --> 02:33:09.747
TO THAT TARGET SORT OF

02:33:09.813 --> 02:33:11.949
ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF PROVIDERS-

02:33:12.016 --> 02:33:13.417
THIS WOULD ALSO SORT OF HELP THE

02:33:13.484 --> 02:33:15.219
LEGISLATURE ASSESS WHETHER THIS

02:33:15.286 --> 02:33:17.321
SPECIFIC SET OF PROVIDERS. ARE

02:33:17.388 --> 02:33:19.189
THE IDEAL ONES TO TARGET IN THIS

02:33:19.256 --> 02:33:22.259
PROPOSAL- THE SECOND COMMENT WE

02:33:22.326 --> 02:33:23.160
WOULD MAKE IS THAT IT'S

02:33:23.227 --> 02:33:24.194
CURRENTLY UNCLEAR AT THIS

02:33:24.261 --> 02:33:26.530
PROPOSAL WILL RELY SOLELY ON

02:33:26.597 --> 02:33:28.098
EXISTING H. CHI WORKFORCE

02:33:28.165 --> 02:33:30.267
PROGRAMS OR IF IT WOULD REQUIRE

02:33:30.334 --> 02:33:32.002
THE CREATION OF ENTIRELY NEW

02:33:32.069 --> 02:33:34.104
PROGRAMS IN H. CHI- THE

02:33:34.171 --> 02:33:35.673
ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED

02:33:35.739 --> 02:33:37.207
THAT IT CURRENTLY PLANS TO

02:33:37.274 --> 02:33:39.076
PROVIDE THIS FUNDING THROUGH THE

02:33:39.143 --> 02:33:40.444
STRUCTURE OF EXISTING PROGRAMS

02:33:40.511 --> 02:33:42.413
AND WILL ASSESS AT A LATER DATE

02:33:42.479 --> 02:33:45.549
WHETHER NEW PROGRAMS ARE NEEDED-

02:33:45.616 --> 02:33:46.850
WE FIND THAT THIS HAS

02:33:46.917 --> 02:33:48.085
IMPLICATIONS FOR. WHAT THE

02:33:48.152 --> 02:33:49.486
APPROPRIATE STATUTORY VEHICLE

WOULD BE FOR IMPLEMENTING THIS

02:33:51.155 --> 02:33:53.424
PROPOSAL ADMINISTRATION IS

02:33:53.490 --> 02:33:55.426
CURRENTLY- PROPOSING PROVISIONAL

02:33:55.492 --> 02:33:56.460
LANGUAGE TO IMPLEMENT THIS

02:33:56.527 --> 02:33:58.462
PROPOSAL LARGELY BASED ON THE

02:33:58.529 --> 02:33:59.830
RATIONALE THAT FUNDING WOULD BE

02:33:59.897 --> 02:34:01.265
PROVIDED THROUGH THE STRUCTURE

02:34:01.332 --> 02:34:03.801
OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS- GIVEN

02:34:03.867 --> 02:34:04.868
THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS

02:34:04.935 --> 02:34:11.075
PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE NEW GRAMS. IF THE LEGISLATURE WISHES TO

02:34:11.141 --> 02:34:12.242
HAVE GREATER INPUT ON THE

02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:13.477
ULTIMATE DESIGN AND STRUCK OF

02:34:13.544 --> 02:34:14.678
THESE NEW PROGRAMS THAT NEED FOR

02:34:14.745 --> 02:34:16.280
TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION OR ARE

02:34:16.347 --> 02:34:18.582
AN ALTERNATIVE VEHICLE- YOU KNOW

02:34:18.649 --> 02:34:19.550
FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS

02:34:19.617 --> 02:34:21.452
PROPOSAL. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

02:34:21.518 --> 02:34:23.087
MAGNITUDE OF FUNDING THAT'S

02:34:23.153 --> 02:34:26.490
BEING PROPOSED HERE- FINALLY WE

02:34:26.557 --> 02:34:27.691
WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE THAT IT'S

02:34:27.758 --> 02:34:28.859
CURRENTLY UNCLEAR HOW THIS

02:34:28.926 --> 02:34:30.260
PROPOSAL WOULD ALIGN OR

02:34:30.327 --> 02:34:32.162
COMPLEMENT EXISTING WORKFORCE

02:34:32.229 --> 02:34:34.498
EFFORTS IN H. CHI- FOR EXAMPLE

02:34:34.565 --> 02:34:35.966
THE WORK FORCE COMPONENTS OF THE

02:34:36.033 --> 02:34:36.834
CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIOR

02:34:36.900 --> 02:34:38.535
HEALTH INITIATIVE WHICH- I'M

02:34:38.602 --> 02:34:40.137
ALSO VERY BROADLY TARGET

02:34:40.204 --> 02:34:42.206
BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROVIDERS- WE

02:34:42.272 --> 02:34:43.707
FIND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION.

02:34:43.774 --> 02:34:45.576
COULD CLEARLY ARTICULATE HOW

02:34:45.643 --> 02:34:46.710
THESE PROPOSALS WILL TOGETHER

02:34:46.777 --> 02:34:48.712
COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER TOWARDS

02:34:48.779 --> 02:34:50.080
REACHING A TARGET GOAL OF

02:34:50.147 --> 02:34:50.914
ADDITIONAL HEALTH CARE

02:34:50.981 --> 02:34:52.483
PROVIDERS- THIS WILL BE

02:34:52.549 --> 02:34:54.151
IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S

02:34:54.218 --> 02:34:55.419
NO DUPLICATION OF FUNDING

02:34:55.486 --> 02:34:57.521
BETWEEN THE TWO PACKAGES. AS YOU

02:34:57.588 --> 02:34:59.356
KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT FUNDING

02:34:59.423 --> 02:35:00.424
FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT

02:35:00.491 --> 02:35:02.359
STRICTLY FOR PROVIDERS WHO TREAT

02:35:02.426 --> 02:35:04.561
ADULTS- THE ADMINISTRATION COULD

02:35:04.628 --> 02:35:06.196
ALSO CLEARLY ARTICULATE HOW THIS

02:35:06.263 --> 02:35:08.565
PROPOSAL WOULD BE EVALUATED. AND

02:35:08.632 --> 02:35:10.167
HOW THESE EVALUATION ACTIVITIES

02:35:10.234 --> 02:35:12.369
WOULD BE SYNTHESIZED WITH-

02:35:12.436 --> 02:35:13.804
EVALUATIONS OF EACH BECAUSE

02:35:13.871 --> 02:35:15.973
OTHER WORKFORCE PROGRAMS TO

02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:17.441
ENSURE THAT THESE EVALUATION

02:35:17.508 --> 02:35:20.678
EFFORTS ARE ARE- SILOS- AND

02:35:20.744 --> 02:35:22.146
THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR COMMENTS AT

02:35:22.212 --> 02:35:23.480
THIS TIME AND- WE'RE HAPPY TO

02:35:23.547 --> 02:35:28.385

02:35:39.863 --> 02:35:41.665
NEBULOUS AT THAT SOME POINT AND

02:35:41.732 --> 02:35:43.767
WE ALL KNOW WHICH IS NEEDED. BUT

02:35:43.834 --> 02:35:45.869
I THINK WE NEED TO GET SOME

02:35:45.936 --> 02:35:48.572
ACTUAL CONCRETE NUMBERS AND I.

02:35:48.639 --> 02:35:51.408

SLIPPER. NO SKIN ON THE ON THE

HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT

03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:19.788
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY OF

03:03:19.855 --> 03:03:20.356
THE DATA THAT IS COMING AND

03:03:20.422 --> 03:03:22.057
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO. HAVE A

03:03:22.124 --> 03:03:23.592
REPORT AND YOU GOT ANALYSIS

03:03:23.659 --> 03:03:25.828
EVERY YEAR SOUNDS- I WILL SAY

03:03:25.894 --> 03:03:27.463
THAT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST

03:03:27.529 --> 03:03:28.831
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WE MADE TO

03:03:28.897 --> 03:03:30.065
THE METHODOLOGY WAS REQUIRE

03:03:30.132 --> 03:03:32.701
EACH- THE PLANS TO HAVE A VENDOR

03:03:32.768 --> 03:03:34.269
OR CONSULTANT REVIEW AND AN

03:03:34.336 --> 03:03:36.038
AUDIT THAT THEY WERE COMPLYING

03:03:36.105 --> 03:03:38.540
WITH THE- METHODOLOGY- SO

03:03:38.607 --> 03:03:39.708
THERE'S SOME. OVERSIGHT THAT

03:03:39.775 --> 03:03:40.876
THEY'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE TO MAKE

03:03:40.943 --> 03:03:42.578
SURE THAT THEY'RE- DOING WHAT

03:03:42.644 --> 03:03:43.712
THEY SHOULD IN TERMS OF THE

03:03:43.779 --> 03:03:45.781
COLLECTION REPORTING OF DATA SO.

03:03:45.848 --> 03:03:48.217
WE CONTINUE TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS

03:03:48.283 --> 03:03:49.985
IN THE REPORTING THANKFULLY.

03:03:50.052 --> 03:03:51.520
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW AND NOW THE

03:03:51.587 --> 03:03:55.157
OTHER I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION

03:03:55.224 --> 03:03:56.825
WAS IS THAT- AT THE FRANKLY THE

03:03:56.892 --> 03:03:57.559
SOME OF THE AND- THE- THE

03:03:57.626 --> 03:03:58.494
STANDARDS THAT LEAD TO

03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:02.698
ENFORCEMENT- SO- BECAUSE- NO

03:04:02.765 --> 03:04:04.800
COMPLIANCE. MAY BE REALIZED HERE

03:04:04.867 --> 03:04:06.769
EXPECTED ONE BE 100% SIDE I

03:04:06.835 --> 03:04:08.871
THINK. THE COMPLIANCE RATE

03:04:08.937 --> 03:04:09.972
DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO BE

03:04:10.038 --> 03:04:11.540
BETTERED AND LIKE 80% OR

03:04:11.607 --> 03:04:13.075
SOMETHING AND I GET THAT RIGHT I

03:04:13.142 --> 03:04:15.778
MEAN IT IT'S- 70% OF THE 70% SO

03:04:15.844 --> 03:04:17.880
THAT MEDIA 70% SO THAT'S IT

03:04:17.946 --> 03:04:19.381
MEANS ALMOST ONE IN THREE YEAR

03:04:19.448 --> 03:04:23.719
TIMES STILL FOR A CONSUMER. IF

03:04:23.786 --> 03:04:24.319
THEY FAILED TO TIMELY ACCESS

03:04:24.386 --> 03:04:25.554
STANDARD. I GUESS IT'S

03:04:25.621 --> 03:04:26.155
TECHNICALLY ONE ENTRY LEVEL A

03:04:26.221 --> 03:04:27.856
LESS THAN ONE THREE THEN THEN

03:04:27.923 --> 03:04:30.392
THE PLANE WENT I MEAN SO. SO

03:04:30.459 --> 03:04:31.693
WHAT ARE YOU FINDING FROM PLAN

03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:33.896
TELL ME PLANS OR SORT OF WICKS

03:04:33.962 --> 03:04:35.364
AN INMATE I THINK BE INTERESTING

03:04:35.431 --> 03:04:36.465
TO KNOW MAYBE DON'T HAVE THE

03:04:36.532 --> 03:04:37.599
SAFETY FINGERTIPS HOW MANY PLANS

03:04:37.666 --> 03:04:39.435
ARE NINETY PERCENTILE AYE MERE

03:04:39.501 --> 03:04:40.969
80% SO I'M HERE 70% SO

03:04:41.036 --> 03:04:42.538
TECHNICALLY ALL THOSE PLANS ARE

03:04:42.604 --> 03:04:45.207
QUOTE OKAY. BUT YOU KNOW YOU

03:04:45.274 --> 03:04:46.408
DIDN'T START THINKING SEVENTY

03:04:46.475 --> 03:04:48.844
PERCENTILE WELL. THAT'S ALMOST

03:04:48.911 --> 03:04:52.314
ONE IN THREE TIMES THAT

03:04:52.381 --> 03:04:53.649
SOMEONE'S NOT ACTUALLY BEING THE

03:04:53.715 --> 03:04:54.983
STANDARD. SO IS IT IN SOME I

03:04:55.050 --> 03:04:57.886
MEAN. SO WHAT ARE MOST OF PLAN

03:04:57.953 --> 03:04:59.488
SITTING IN THAT EIGHTY THIS IS

03:04:59.555 --> 03:05:00.722
ABOUT SEVENTY TO EIGHTY

03:05:00.789 --> 03:05:02.324
PERCENTILE OR YOU KNOW IT I MEAN

03:05:02.391 --> 03:05:04.660
I DO. IT WHEN WE DEVELOP THE

03:05:04.726 --> 03:05:06.161
STANDARDS WE THOUGHT OF THEM AS

03:05:06.228 --> 03:05:09.331
MINIMUM STANDARDS NOT STANDARDS

03:05:09.398 --> 03:05:12.201
THAT WERE. YOU KNOW. IDEAL SO

03:05:12.267 --> 03:05:13.669
CONTINUE SPEAK CAN YOU SPEAK TO

03:05:13.735 --> 03:05:16.004
WHERE PLANS ARE UNDERSTAND AND

03:05:16.071 --> 03:05:17.873
IN RELATION TO THE STANDARDS.

03:05:17.940 --> 03:05:19.408
SURE YEAH LOOK LET ME LET ME

03:05:19.475 --> 03:05:21.143
TALK ABOUT THE SEVENTY PERCENT-

03:05:21.210 --> 03:05:22.444
PARTMINER WHAT THAT MEANS IS

03:05:22.511 --> 03:05:23.979
WHEN WE CONDUCTED WAR WITH THE

03:05:24.046 --> 03:05:24.780
HEALTH PLANS CONDUCTED THE

03:05:24.847 --> 03:05:27.249
SURVEY AND THEY CALLED A RANDOM

03:05:27.316 --> 03:05:30.853
SAMPLE OF THE PROVIDERS- 70% OR

03:05:30.919 --> 03:05:32.020
MORE OF THE PROVIDERS THAT

03:05:32.087 --> 03:05:33.956
ANSWERED THAT CALL FOR THE

03:05:34.022 --> 03:05:35.491
SURVEY- HOW TO BOOK AN

03:05:35.557 --> 03:05:36.825
APPOINTMENT AVAILABLE WITHIN THE

03:05:36.892 --> 03:05:38.093
TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS THAT ARE

03:05:38.160 --> 03:05:40.195
WITHIN THE LAW- THE TIME NEXUS

03:05:40.262 --> 03:05:42.397
STANDARDS DON'T MEAN THAT- EVERY

03:05:42.464 --> 03:05:43.999
SINGLE PROVIDER THAT YOU WANT TO

03:05:44.066 --> 03:05:45.701
SEE- WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE AN

03:05:45.767 --> 03:05:46.935
APPOINTMENT AVAILABLE ON THE

03:05:47.002 --> 03:05:48.637
DATE. THE TIME WHEN YOU WANT TO

03:05:48.704 --> 03:05:50.372
SEE THEM BUT IT MEANS THAT THE

03:05:50.439 --> 03:05:52.241
NETWORK NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO

03:05:52.307 --> 03:05:53.675
SUPPORT OUR PROVIDED A POINT

03:05:53.742 --> 03:05:55.611
WITHIN THOSE STANDARDS- SO THERE

03:05:55.677 --> 03:05:57.412
ARE SITUATIONS WHERE A PROVIDER

03:05:57.479 --> 03:05:58.814
MAY NOT HAPPEN APPOINTMENT WHEN

03:05:58.881 --> 03:06:00.115
THEY'RE CALLED THEY MAY BE ON

03:06:00.182 --> 03:06:01.617
VACATION THEY MAY BE WORKING

03:06:01.683 --> 03:06:03.285
PART TIME. AND THERE'S A LOT OF

03:06:03.352 --> 03:06:04.586
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WHEN THAT

03:06:04.653 --> 03:06:06.221
INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS CONTRACTED

03:06:06.288 --> 03:06:08.457
WHY THEY NOT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

03:06:08.524 --> 03:06:10.492
MEET THE STANDARD. BUT WE AND

03:06:10.559 --> 03:06:13.896
WHAT WE EXPECT IS THAT THAT 70%

03:06:13.962 --> 03:06:15.163
MEANS THAT THE NETWORK SHOULD BE

03:06:15.230 --> 03:06:17.566
ABLE TO SUPPORT IT IN A TIMELY

03:06:17.633 --> 03:06:20.435
APPOINTMENT I WILL SAY THAT 70%

03:06:20.502 --> 03:06:22.337
STANDARD WAS HORRIFIED ARE

03:06:22.404 --> 03:06:24.106
REGULATION WHICH WAS RECENTLY

03:06:24.172 --> 03:06:25.741
APPROVED WILL BE TAKING A FACT.

03:06:25.807 --> 03:06:28.010
AND SO GOING FORWARD- WE WILL BE

03:06:28.076 --> 03:06:29.144
ABLE TO HOLD THE HEALTH PLANS

03:06:29.211 --> 03:06:30.679
ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT STANDARD IS

03:06:30.746 --> 03:06:32.581
NOT BEEN CODIFIED IN REGULATION

03:06:32.648 --> 03:06:35.284
FOR THAT SO- WE HAVE AN ANNUAL

03:06:35.350 --> 03:06:37.586
REPORT WILL BE REPLACING THE

03:06:37.653 --> 03:06:39.254

OF WHERE THE PLANTS ARE. IN

03:06:48.797 --> 03:06:49.264

CHILD WELFARE PROGRAMS AND OTHER

03:45:47.400 --> 03:45:49.102
PROGRAMS BEGIN TO COMPETE. FOR

03:45:49.168 --> 03:45:50.503
LIMITED POOL OF STAFF AND THAT

03:45:50.570 --> 03:45:52.705
THAT'S THAT'S- YEAH EVEN BEST A

03:45:52.772 --> 03:45:54.374
LOT OF TIME IN ADMINISTRATION IS

03:45:54.440 --> 03:45:55.275

03:45:55.341 --> 03:45:58.177
ENERGY TO ADDRESS I JUST WANT TO

03:45:58.244 --> 03:45:59.445
REITERATE THAT. WE ALSO WANT TO

03:45:59.512 --> 03:46:00.947
BETTER UNDERSTAND THE KINDS OF

PROGRAMMATIC INVESTMENTS. THAT

03:46:03.149 --> 03:46:04.550
ARE MOST EFFECTIVE SO THAT WE

COUNTIES AND SCHOOL PARTNER

SHOULD BE INVESTING IN ONE OF

03:46:11.324 --> 03:46:12.592
THE QUESTIONS THAT WE GET.

03:46:12.659 --> 03:46:13.793
ROUTINELY FROM OUR LOCAL

COME WITH A LOT MORE OUTCOMES

03:48:39.105 --> 03:48:41.007
AND ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH I THINK

03:48:41.074 --> 03:48:42.408

A LONG TIME AND WE'RE STILL

STILL NOT REALLY SURE WHERE ALL

03:48:48.681 --> 03:48:50.283

03:49:15.041 --> 03:49:17.376
THE IMPORTANCE THAT- WEEK WE GET

03:49:17.443 --> 03:49:18.277

FUNDS FOR IMPORTANT FUNDS TO

03:49:46.339 --> 03:49:48.474
HELP INDUCE EVALUATION AS WELL

03:49:48.541 --> 03:49:51.677
AS US. THESE PROGRAMS. HAVE BEEN

03:49:51.744 --> 03:49:53.246
WHICH WAY DO YOU THINK YOU'RE A

03:49:53.312 --> 03:49:54.380
THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IN

03:49:54.447 --> 03:49:56.415
THIS AREA CAN HELP INFORM THE-

03:49:56.482 --> 03:49:58.050
THAT BEHAVIOR HELP ME ON THE U.

03:49:58.117 --> 03:49:59.118
FEVER HEALTH INITIATIVE AND WHAT

03:49:59.185 --> 03:50:00.253
DO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE

03:50:00.319 --> 03:50:02.555
GETTING SOME. RESULTS THAT YOU

03:50:02.622 --> 03:50:06.159
MIGHT FEEL THIS. TO SHARE NÂNG

03:50:06.225 --> 03:50:07.293
WITH THEM BUT ALSO WITH US AS

03:50:07.360 --> 03:50:08.694
WELL. AND BEST PRACTICE MODELS

03:50:08.761 --> 03:50:10.763
YEAH SO THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION

03:50:10.830 --> 03:50:12.398
THE COMMISSION HAS A RECORD DUE

03:50:12.465 --> 03:50:14.534
TO THE LEGISLATURE AND I THINK

03:50:14.600 --> 03:50:16.335
ON MARCH FIRST THAT WILL

03:50:16.402 --> 03:50:18.271
PRIMARILY FOCUS ON WHERE WE ARE

03:50:18.337 --> 03:50:20.106
IN TERMS OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF

03:50:20.173 --> 03:50:22.308
RESOURCES SOME OF OUR LOCAL

03:50:22.375 --> 03:50:23.876
PARTNERS HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF

03:50:23.943 --> 03:50:26.412
YEARS TO BEGIN TO ROLL OUT THE

03:50:26.479 --> 03:50:28.281
STRATEGIES AND SO WE HAVE SO

03:50:28.347 --> 03:50:29.482
THERE'S THE OPTION TO LEARN

03:50:29.549 --> 03:50:31.050
MORE. FROM THOSE PARTNERS THAN

03:50:31.117 --> 03:50:32.652
THOSE WHO FOR EXAMPLE WERE

03:50:32.718 --> 03:50:34.854
AWARDED FUNDS JUST EARLIER THIS

03:50:34.921 --> 03:50:39.025
WEEK SO- SO I THINK YOU KNOW THE

03:50:39.091 --> 03:50:40.259
- WHAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT FROM US

03:50:40.326 --> 03:50:41.994
FIRST. IS JUST SOME

03:50:42.061 --> 03:50:45.364
CLARIFICATION OF WHERE WE ARE.

03:50:45.431 --> 03:50:46.432
AND THE KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT

03:50:46.499 --> 03:50:49.068
WE'RE FACING AND THE REALITIES

03:50:49.135 --> 03:50:50.636
THAT ARE THAT WE'RE SEEING IN

03:50:50.703 --> 03:50:52.338
OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WE

03:50:52.405 --> 03:50:54.440
BEGAN TO TRY TO AS YOU SAID SORT

03:50:54.507 --> 03:50:55.775
OF STRENGTH IN AND ADDRESS SOME

03:50:55.841 --> 03:50:57.443
OF THE STYLING. BETWEEN THESE

03:50:57.510 --> 03:50:59.712
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AT ITS CORE

03:50:59.779 --> 03:51:00.746
THAT WAS THE COMMISSION'S

03:51:00.813 --> 03:51:03.049
INTENTION. IN TERMS OF RELIGION

03:51:03.115 --> 03:51:04.217
IS FUNDS AS WE WERE VERY

03:51:04.283 --> 03:51:06.118
EXPLICIT THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE

03:51:06.185 --> 03:51:07.353
ROBUST PARTNERSHIP SO WE CAN

03:51:07.420 --> 03:51:09.155
ADDRESS THOSE SILOS. BUT HOW

03:51:09.222 --> 03:51:10.690
THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WERE FORMED

03:51:10.756 --> 03:51:11.991
AND HOW AND WHERE THEY FOCUS

03:51:12.058 --> 03:51:13.593
NEEDED TO BE WORKED OUT LOCALLY

03:51:13.659 --> 03:51:15.294
SO THAT THEY WERE RESPONSIVE TO

03:51:15.361 --> 03:51:16.229
THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THESE

03:51:16.295 --> 03:51:17.830
COMMUNITIES. THE STRENGTH OF

03:51:17.897 --> 03:51:19.632
THAT APPROACH IS THAT ALLOWS US

03:51:19.699 --> 03:51:21.200
TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE DOLLARS

03:51:21.267 --> 03:51:22.902
ARE RESPONSIVE AND TIMELY. THE

03:51:22.969 --> 03:51:24.737
LIMITATION IS IT MEANS YOU'VE

03:51:24.804 --> 03:51:26.072
GOT FIFTY FOUR DIFFERENT

03:51:26.138 --> 03:51:27.306
APPROACHES WHICH MAKES IT VERY

03:51:27.373 --> 03:51:29.976
HARD. TO CREATE A CONSISTENT

03:51:30.042 --> 03:51:31.944
UNDERSTANDING. FROM FROM THE

03:51:32.011 --> 03:51:33.946
NOTION OF A SINGLE PROGRAM IT'S

03:51:34.013 --> 03:51:35.114
A PROGRAM IN TERMS OF THE

03:51:35.181 --> 03:51:36.682
FUNDING SOURCE AND THE STRATEGY

03:51:36.749 --> 03:51:38.584
THAT WE'RE ROLLING OUT. BUT IT'S

03:51:38.651 --> 03:51:39.819
NOT A PROGRAM IN TERMS OF THE

03:51:39.885 --> 03:51:41.587
KINDS OF SERVICES THAT ARE BEING

03:51:41.654 --> 03:51:42.622
DELIVERED AND SO IT'S GOING TO

03:51:42.688 --> 03:51:44.123
BE VERY DIFFICULT TO COMPARE

03:51:44.190 --> 03:51:45.758
APPLES TO APPLES SO TO SPEAK.

03:51:45.825 --> 03:51:47.059
ACROSS ALL OFTHESE DIFFERENT

03:51:47.126 --> 03:51:48.261
STRATEGIES THAT'S GOING TO BE

03:51:48.327 --> 03:51:49.695
EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF

03:51:49.762 --> 03:51:52.465
THE FACTOR OF TIME- WHERE WE

03:51:52.531 --> 03:51:54.233
HAVE ROLE THESE DOLLARS OUT I

03:51:54.300 --> 03:51:55.868
BELIEVE ACROSS FIVE DIFFERENT.

03:51:55.935 --> 03:51:58.571
STUFF FUNDING CYCLES SO WE'RE

03:51:58.638 --> 03:52:01.240
STILL WORKING TO- KIND OF CATCH

03:52:01.307 --> 03:52:03.609
UP. AND LISTEN AND LEARN FROM

03:52:03.676 --> 03:52:04.944
THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

03:52:05.011 --> 03:52:07.146
FARTHER ALONG WHILE ALSO TRYING

03:52:07.213 --> 03:52:08.047
TO SUPPORT THOSE COMMUNITIES

03:52:08.114 --> 03:52:09.815
THAT ARE JUST GETTING STARTED.

03:52:09.882 --> 03:52:11.817
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THIS YEAR

03:52:11.884 --> 03:52:13.319
WORKING WITH THE TWENTY COUNTIES

03:52:13.386 --> 03:52:15.354
THAT DID NOT APPLY TO PRIOR

03:52:15.421 --> 03:52:17.189
FUNDING CYCLES TO REALLY

03:52:17.256 --> 03:52:18.991
UNDERSTAND THE BEARS THEY FACED.

03:52:19.058 --> 03:52:22.128
ENTER INTO THE HAIR BACK. THE

03:52:22.194 --> 03:52:23.796
COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM SO

03:52:23.863 --> 03:52:25.264
THAT WE HAD THE FEWEST

03:52:25.331 --> 03:52:28.334
REQUIREMENTS WE COULD. PUT IN.

03:52:28.401 --> 03:52:30.469
INTO THAT PROGRAM WHILE STILL

03:52:30.536 --> 03:52:32.538
COMPLYING WITH THE REQUIREMENTS-

03:52:32.605 --> 03:52:34.840
IS THE STATE FUNDING RULES- BY

03:52:34.907 --> 03:52:36.475
JUST AS THE FEDERAL AND THE

03:52:36.542 --> 03:52:40.112
FEDERAL. FUNDING RULES IN THE

03:52:40.179 --> 03:52:40.746
INSTANCES WHERE REASONS ON THE

03:52:40.813 --> 03:52:41.981
FUNDING. SO I. SENATOR I THINK

03:52:42.048 --> 03:52:43.449
IT'S GONNA TAKE A COUPLE OF

03:52:43.516 --> 03:52:46.552
YEARS AT LEAST. TO REALLY. BE

03:52:46.619 --> 03:52:49.055
ABLE TO CONNECT AN INTERVENTION.

03:52:49.121 --> 03:52:51.057
TO AN EDUCATIONAL OUTCOME. BUT

03:52:51.123 --> 03:52:52.625
THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T LEARN

03:52:52.692 --> 03:52:55.961
SOMETHING. ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE

03:52:56.028 --> 03:52:57.930
THESE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES ARE

03:52:57.997 --> 03:53:00.166
IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE SILO

03:53:00.232 --> 03:53:02.501
ING ISSUE. THAT IS OFTEN AT THE

03:53:02.568 --> 03:53:04.303
CORE OF WHY. MANY OF THESE

03:53:04.370 --> 03:53:05.404
FAMILIES ARE STARVING NEED

03:53:05.471 --> 03:53:06.939
ACCESS TO CARE AND SO I THINK

03:53:07.006 --> 03:53:08.474
YOU KNOW WE NEED TO REALLY BE

03:53:08.541 --> 03:53:10.776
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE CAN SAY.

03:53:10.843 --> 03:53:12.745
AROUND ISSUES LIKE GOVERNANCE

03:53:12.812 --> 03:53:14.880
AND INCENTIVES BARRIERS TO CARE

03:53:14.947 --> 03:53:16.549
THE NEED FOR TRAINING AND THE

03:53:16.615 --> 03:53:17.783
IMPACT THAT THOSE KINDS OF

03:53:17.850 --> 03:53:19.318
INVESTMENTS ARE HAVING. IT'S A

03:53:19.385 --> 03:53:21.087
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION TO THEN

03:53:21.153 --> 03:53:23.322
SAY EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES ARE ON

03:53:23.389 --> 03:53:25.257
THE UPSWING BECAUSE WE'VE MADE

03:53:25.324 --> 03:53:27.560
THERE THESE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS

03:53:27.626 --> 03:53:29.862
IN MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING-

03:53:29.929 --> 03:53:32.865
YOU KNOW IN SAY. MIDDLE SCHOOL

03:53:32.932 --> 03:53:34.400
FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE STRUGGLING.

03:53:34.467 --> 03:53:35.935
AT NIGHT OF APPRECIATE THAT IN A

03:53:36.001 --> 03:53:37.803
IN AND REALIZE THAT- YOU KNOW

03:53:37.870 --> 03:53:39.705
TAKES TIME TO DO VALUATION AND

03:53:39.772 --> 03:53:41.140
I'VE SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE. THE

03:53:41.207 --> 03:53:42.441
PROCESS MUST HAVE GONE ON LONG

03:53:42.508 --> 03:53:43.843
ENOUGH FOR YOU TO EVALUATE AND

03:53:43.909 --> 03:53:46.278
SEE EXACTLY SOME DATA- SO. BUT I

03:53:46.345 --> 03:53:48.848
GUESS I ALSO HOPE THAT- IS WE'RE

03:53:48.914 --> 03:53:49.915
RUNNING THESE THINGS IN PARALLEL

03:53:49.982 --> 03:53:51.951
WE TALK ABOUT THE URGENCY OF

03:53:52.017 --> 03:53:52.585
BEING ABLE TO TRUST THINGS FOR

03:53:52.651 --> 03:53:55.154
EXAMPLE WENT. HOPEFULLY AND

03:53:55.221 --> 03:53:56.122
MAYBE USING QUALITATIVE

03:53:56.188 --> 03:53:57.823
APPROACHES AT LEAST WE CAN LEARN

03:53:57.890 --> 03:53:59.959
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW LEAST THAT.

03:54:00.025 --> 03:54:01.694
THE PROGRAMS HAVE COME TOGETHER

03:54:01.761 --> 03:54:03.763
HOW THEY MANAGED TO YOU KNOW GET

03:54:03.829 --> 03:54:04.997
THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER HOW TO

03:54:05.064 --> 03:54:06.832
GET EDUCATION COUNTY TO WORK.

03:54:06.899 --> 03:54:08.300
SOME OF THE PER EVEN SOME OF THE

03:54:08.367 --> 03:54:09.668
PROCESS LESSONS MIGHT BE VERY

03:54:09.735 --> 03:54:11.771
HELPFUL AS WE'RE TRYING TO ROLL

I CAN'T TAKE PLACE FOR MANY

03:54:20.713 --> 03:54:22.148
YEARS. BUT THERE MIGHT BE SOME

03:54:22.214 --> 03:54:23.282
INTERIM STUFF ESPECIALLY ON THE

03:54:23.349 --> 03:54:25.284
QUALITATIVE SIDE THAT. WE MIGHT

03:54:25.351 --> 03:54:27.119
WANT TO CONSIDER INVESTING IN

THAT WAY TO HELP INFORM. LIKE

03:54:28.988 --> 03:54:29.855
HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE COUNTIES IN

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND IN THE

03:58:59.491 --> 03:59:01.060
LAST YEAR IN RESPONSE TO THE

03:59:01.126 --> 03:59:02.861
CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN THE

03:59:02.928 --> 03:59:03.896
RECESSION THE AMERICAN RESCUE

03:59:03.962 --> 03:59:06.065
PLAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED

03:59:11.336 --> 03:59:13.472
MARKET PLACE AND SIGNIFICANTLY

03:59:13.539 --> 03:59:15.274
REMOVED THAT PREMIUM

03:59:15.340 --> 03:59:16.475
REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR LOWEST

03:59:16.542 --> 03:59:19.011

BARRED MIDDLE INCOME ENROLLEES

03:59:22.681 --> 03:59:24.583

03:59:27.586 --> 03:59:29.188
SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL INVESTMENT

IN AFFORDABILITY- OUR ENROLLMENT

03:59:32.458 --> 03:59:34.026
HAS PUSHED TO RECORD LEVELS WERE

03:59:34.093 --> 03:59:36.428
AT AN ALL TIME HIGH. OF ONE

03:59:36.495 --> 03:59:38.864
POINT EIGHT MILLION IN RALEIGH'S

03:59:38.931 --> 03:59:42.000
IN OUR PROGRAM THIS IS MORE THAN

03:59:42.067 --> 03:59:43.802
THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

03:59:43.869 --> 03:59:46.004

03:59:46.071 --> 03:59:52.711
THE START OF. TWENTY TWENTY

03:59:52.778 --> 03:59:53.479
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. MANAGER I

03:59:53.545 --> 03:59:54.546
THINK THE PROBABLY ISN'T PLACE

03:59:54.613 --> 03:59:56.648
FOR US TO MOVE TO ISSUE TO START

03:59:56.715 --> 03:59:59.384
. TALKING THEIR UP- I GUESS

03:59:59.451 --> 04:00:00.986

TIME. I WILL CALL THEM BACK NOW

04:00:15.868 --> 04:00:16.935
. AND I THINK THAT COMMITTEE

04:00:17.002 --> 04:00:20.038
AGENDA WELL TRAINS- SOME OF THE

04:00:20.105 --> 04:00:23.208
FEDERAL UNCERTAINTY AND THAT'S

04:00:23.275 --> 04:00:24.877
STILL NEED POLICY ENVIRONMENT

04:00:24.943 --> 04:00:26.545
RIGHT NOW SO YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE

04:00:26.612 --> 04:00:29.348

BETWEEN COVER CALIFORNIA

04:00:30.582 --> 04:00:32.151
LEGISLATION ADMINISTRATION OVER

THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS THIS

04:00:33.418 --> 04:00:35.454
WEEK HAVE THAT CERTAINTY MORE

04:00:35.521 --> 04:00:36.822
CERTAINTY FROM THE FEDERAL

04:00:36.889 --> 04:00:39.291
GOVERNMENT AND SO I TALKED A

04:00:39.358 --> 04:00:42.261
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FEDERAL

04:00:42.327 --> 04:00:43.262
PREMIUM SUPPORT. THEY CAME IN

04:00:43.328 --> 04:00:44.963
WITH THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN

04:00:45.030 --> 04:00:46.832
BUT DESPITE THAT IMPROVE PREMIUM

04:00:46.899 --> 04:00:48.433
SUPPORT WE HAVEN'T REALLY MOVE

04:00:48.500 --> 04:00:49.601
THE NEEDLE O CARSHARING

04:00:49.668 --> 04:00:51.937
SUPPORTED STILL LIMITED TO OUR

04:00:52.004 --> 04:00:55.140
LOWEST INCOME ENROLLEES. REALLY

04:00:55.207 --> 04:00:56.975
THE BULK OF THE SUBSIDY BECAUSE

04:00:57.042 --> 04:00:59.411
GENITALS FOR UNDER TWO HUNDRED.

04:00:59.478 --> 04:01:00.579
102% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

04:01:00.646 --> 04:01:01.980

SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS UP

04:01:04.850 --> 04:01:06.318
2210050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

04:01:06.385 --> 04:01:08.287
LEVEL THE SLIGHTEST OBVIOUSLY

04:01:08.353 --> 04:01:10.489
DATED DENSO JUST HIGHLIGHTS. AND

04:01:10.556 --> 04:01:11.657
SOME OF THE EFFECTS THAT ARE

04:01:11.723 --> 04:01:13.826
ENROLLEES FEEL AS THAT FEDERAL

04:01:13.892 --> 04:01:15.727
SUPPORT DECREASES. AND

04:01:15.794 --> 04:01:17.763
DEDUCTIBLES THAT THE EXPERIENCE

04:01:17.830 --> 04:01:19.498
FOR IN PATIENT CARE RISE PRETTY

04:01:19.565 --> 04:01:21.233
SIGNIFICANTLY WERE ABLE TO KEEP

04:01:21.300 --> 04:01:25.337
THOSE DEDUCTIBLES LIMITED TO IN

04:01:25.404 --> 04:01:28.307
PATIENT CARE- BY THE RISE FROM.

04:01:28.373 --> 04:01:30.509
SORT OF MODEST LEVEL OF SEVENTY

04:01:30.576 --> 04:01:31.777
FIVE DOLLARS UP TO THE THOUSANDS

04:01:31.844 --> 04:01:34.546
OF DOLLARS AS INCOME. INCREASES

04:01:34.613 --> 04:01:35.848
AND THAT'S FEDERAL SUPPORTS

04:01:35.914 --> 04:01:38.684
DISAPPEAR SIMILARLY ON THE CAPS

04:01:38.750 --> 04:01:40.752
THAT LIMIT ARE YOUR MAXIMUM

04:01:40.819 --> 04:01:43.355
EXPOSURE IN THE YEAR. AND THEN

04:01:43.422 --> 04:01:44.857
OBVIOUSLY HITTING SOME OF THOSE

04:01:44.923 --> 04:01:48.560
COPAYS AND SERVICE AS A PRIMARY

04:01:48.627 --> 04:01:50.896
CARE FOR GENERIC DRUGS. SO I

04:01:50.963 --> 04:01:53.732
DEFINITELY IMPACTS. OUR

04:01:53.799 --> 04:01:56.134
ENROLLEES AND THEIR CHOICES AND

04:01:56.201 --> 04:01:57.870
HERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF THAT SORT

04:01:57.936 --> 04:02:01.540
OF OUTCOME OF NASH AND- THE

04:02:01.607 --> 04:02:03.375
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OFFERS A

04:02:03.442 --> 04:02:05.744
VARIETY OF COVERAGE LEVELS WE

04:02:05.811 --> 04:02:07.145
CALL THEM THE OLYMPIC MEDAL

04:02:07.212 --> 04:02:09.882
TEARS THEY RANGE FROM BRONZE TO

04:02:09.948 --> 04:02:11.583
PLATINUM- AS THE NAMING

04:02:11.650 --> 04:02:13.285
CONVENTION IMPLIES THOSE GO

04:02:13.352 --> 04:02:16.088
FROM- LOW GENEROSITY HIGH

04:02:16.154 --> 04:02:17.723
GENEROSITY IF YOU'RE IN A BRONZE

04:02:17.789 --> 04:02:18.891
PLAN IN VERY LOW MONTHLY

04:02:18.957 --> 04:02:21.226
PREMIUM. BUT SIGNIFICANT COST

04:02:21.293 --> 04:02:23.762
SHARING OR DEDUCTIBLES AND ARE

04:02:23.829 --> 04:02:25.697
PROBLEMS PLAN. AT SIXTY THREE

04:02:25.764 --> 04:02:27.099
HUNDRED DOLLARS. FOR AN

04:02:27.165 --> 04:02:30.002
INDIVIDUAL A DOUBLE FOR A FAMILY

04:02:30.068 --> 04:02:32.304
SO AS THOSE FEDERAL SUPPORTS

04:02:32.371 --> 04:02:34.273
DISAPPEAR FOR COST SHARING. OUR

04:02:34.339 --> 04:02:37.009
ENROLLEES ARE CHOOSE BRONZE AT A

04:02:37.075 --> 04:02:40.245
SIGNIFICANTLY. HIGHER SHARE AND

04:02:40.312 --> 04:02:42.147
THEN WE HAVE THAT WE HEARD SOME

04:02:42.214 --> 04:02:43.515
DATA STATEWIDE DATA FROM

04:02:43.582 --> 04:02:45.550
DIRECTOR LANDS BURKE ON. THE

04:02:45.617 --> 04:02:47.486
IMPACTS OF ENROLLEES FEELING

04:02:47.552 --> 04:02:49.321
AFFORDABILITY IN TELLING CARE

04:02:49.388 --> 04:02:52.524
JUST A DATA POINT IN THIS SLIDE.

04:02:52.591 --> 04:02:54.693
TOMORROW NUMBER DATA ABOUT OUR

04:02:54.760 --> 04:02:56.194

OUR ENROLLEES WHO ARE AND OUR

04:03:02.935 --> 04:03:06.271
MOST GENEROUS PLAN. ON ALL STATE

04:03:06.338 --> 04:03:07.572
DEPARTMENTS COME WITH THEIR OWN

04:03:07.639 --> 04:03:10.208
WONKY TERMS SHOW OVER NINETY

04:03:10.275 --> 04:03:11.510

04:03:11.576 --> 04:03:13.178
THAT'S FOR OUR OUR LOWEST INCOME

04:03:13.245 --> 04:03:14.813
ENROLLEES PROVIDES THEM AS A

04:03:14.880 --> 04:03:17.816
VERY STRONG OUT OF POCKET COST

04:03:17.883 --> 04:03:20.018
SHARING SUPPORT. DO YOU SEE THE

04:03:20.085 --> 04:03:21.687
EFFECTS OF THIS ARE IN

04:03:21.753 --> 04:03:23.422
AFFORDABILITY FOR OUR MEMBERS

04:03:23.488 --> 04:03:25.090
THIS WITH THAT I THINK THE

04:03:25.157 --> 04:03:27.993
POLICY LANDSCAPE. THAT LED THE

04:03:28.060 --> 04:03:29.795
LEGISLATURE TO ASK US TO LOOK AT

04:03:29.861 --> 04:03:32.197
THIS ISSUE IN DEPTH. AND SO WE

04:03:32.264 --> 04:03:35.000
DID RELEASE- BRINGING CARE

04:03:35.067 --> 04:03:36.969
WITHIN REACH. APOLOGIES FOR THE

04:03:37.035 --> 04:03:38.070
BABY PICTURE THAT WE PUT ON THE

04:03:38.136 --> 04:03:40.439
SIDE OF THE COVER THE REPORT-

04:03:40.505 --> 04:03:42.207
BUT THIS PROVIDE SPECIFIC

04:03:42.274 --> 04:03:43.842
OPTIONS FOR HOW WE CAN USE OR

04:03:43.909 --> 04:03:45.243
OTHER STATES COULD YOU STATE

04:03:45.310 --> 04:03:47.512
FUNDING FOR FEDERAL FUNDING. AND

04:03:47.579 --> 04:03:49.381
TO EXPAND CARSHARING SUPPORT WE

04:03:49.448 --> 04:03:50.716
ALSO RELEASED A SHORTER ISSUE

04:03:50.782 --> 04:03:53.151
BRIEF AND VERY DETAILED ANALYSIS

04:03:53.218 --> 04:03:54.386
BY OUR ACTUARIES WHO SUPPORTED

04:03:54.453 --> 04:03:56.355
US IN THIS PARK. AND WE WERE

04:03:56.421 --> 04:03:58.523
VERY PLEASED TO HAVE BEEN PUT AN

04:03:58.590 --> 04:03:59.358
ENGAGEMENT FROM A RANGE OF

04:03:59.424 --> 04:04:00.993
STAKEHOLDER PARTNERS. AND

04:04:01.059 --> 04:04:03.161
LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND AGAIN IN

04:04:03.228 --> 04:04:04.763
COMPLIANCE WITH THAT THE STATE

04:04:04.830 --> 04:04:08.300
BUDGET ACT IN THE TRAILER BILL

04:04:08.367 --> 04:04:09.835
FROM LAST YEAR- SO TALK A LITTLE

04:04:09.901 --> 04:04:10.869
BIT ABOUT ASK FEDERAL

04:04:10.936 --> 04:04:13.271
LEGISLATION. THE BILL BACK

04:04:13.338 --> 04:04:15.140
BETTER ACT OR A SIMILAR FEDERAL

04:04:15.207 --> 04:04:17.009
POLICY WOULD EXTEND THOSE

04:04:17.075 --> 04:04:18.410
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN PREMIUM

04:04:18.477 --> 04:04:20.112
SUBSIDIES THAT ARE IN EFFECT FOR

04:04:20.178 --> 04:04:22.514
THIS CALENDAR YEAR. WE DO THAT

04:04:22.581 --> 04:04:24.683
THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. I'LL

04:04:24.750 --> 04:04:25.951
TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE

04:04:26.018 --> 04:04:27.419
IMPACTS OF THE SUBSIDIES THAT

04:04:27.486 --> 04:04:29.521
HELP LIKE I SAID HAVE BEEN

04:04:29.588 --> 04:04:31.490
SIGNIFICANT. AND THIS THAT HOUSE

04:04:31.556 --> 04:04:32.724
PASSED VERSION OF BUILD BACK

04:04:32.791 --> 04:04:34.126
BETTER WOULD ALSO ESTABLISH

04:04:34.192 --> 04:04:36.328
AFFORDABILITY. THAT WOULD

04:04:36.395 --> 04:04:38.296
PROVIDE TEN BILLION PER YEAR FOR

04:04:38.363 --> 04:04:41.133
EACH YEAR THREE YEARS ON THE

04:04:41.199 --> 04:04:42.367
SLIDE. IT WOULD ALLOW STATES TO

04:04:42.434 --> 04:04:45.837
ROUTE TO LOWER THE COST SHARING-

04:04:45.904 --> 04:04:48.807
AND PREMIUMS- SO VERY SIMILAR TO

04:04:48.874 --> 04:04:50.742
THE CONCEPT THAT WAS INCLUDED-

04:04:50.809 --> 04:04:52.711
WHEN THE STATE PUT AWAY THREE

04:04:52.778 --> 04:04:53.311
HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION IN THE

04:04:53.378 --> 04:04:54.946
STATE AFFORDABILITY FUND FOR

04:04:55.013 --> 04:04:56.748
THIS PURPOSE. AND SO THAT'S THE

04:04:56.815 --> 04:04:59.317
POTENTIAL FEDERAL POLICY

04:04:59.384 --> 04:05:02.354
LANDSCAPE. AND GIVEN THAT OUR

04:05:02.421 --> 04:05:04.222
REORT FRAME SORT OF THREE

04:05:04.289 --> 04:05:08.727
SCENARIOS- ONE- OF. THE WORST

04:05:08.794 --> 04:05:10.328
CASE SCENARIO AMERICAN RESCUE

04:05:10.395 --> 04:05:13.231
PLAN SUBSIDIES EXPIRE IN TWENTY

04:05:13.298 --> 04:05:14.266
TWENTY TWO THERE'S NO FEDERAL

04:05:14.332 --> 04:05:16.068
ACTION TO EXTEND THEM. AND THAT

04:05:16.134 --> 04:05:17.135
WOULD OBVIOUSLY GIVE THE STATE

04:05:17.202 --> 04:05:19.304
TRADE OFFS IN TERMS OF. HOW TO

04:05:19.371 --> 04:05:21.440
SPEND THE AFFORDABILITY MONEY TO

04:05:21.506 --> 04:05:22.474
LOOK AT CAR SHARING A TO LOOK

04:05:22.541 --> 04:05:24.376
AT. AND WE LOOK AT THE STATE

04:05:24.443 --> 04:05:28.146
PREMIUM SUPPORT PROGRAM. THE

04:05:28.213 --> 04:05:30.615
NEXT OPTION IS THAT AND BUILD

04:05:30.682 --> 04:05:32.484
BACK BETTER IN CONCEPT THIS

04:05:32.551 --> 04:05:34.252
STUNNING PREMIUM SUBSIDIES IN

04:05:34.319 --> 04:05:35.987
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS

04:05:36.054 --> 04:05:36.822
SUPPORTS WE HAVE SOME OPTIONS

04:05:36.888 --> 04:05:39.224
THERE. AND THEN LASTLY AND THIS

04:05:39.291 --> 04:05:40.525
WAS REALLY WHERE WE GET MOST OF

04:05:40.592 --> 04:05:42.928
OUR WORK THIS IS I THINK WHAT

04:05:42.994 --> 04:05:43.595
WAS ANTICIPATED WHEN THEY'RE OF

04:05:43.662 --> 04:05:45.230
THE STATE LEGISLATURE ASKED US

04:05:45.297 --> 04:05:47.432
TO LOOK AT THE- A. R. P. PREMIUM

04:05:47.499 --> 04:05:48.767
SUBSIDIES ARE EXTENDED SO WE

04:05:48.834 --> 04:05:50.502
HAVE THAT. MUCH MORE GENEROUS

04:05:50.569 --> 04:05:52.370
PREMIUM SUPPORT WE USED THE

04:05:52.437 --> 04:05:54.072
STATE FUNDING TO COMPLEMENT THAT

04:05:54.139 --> 04:05:58.176
AND REDUCE COSTS AND SO THOSE

04:05:58.243 --> 04:05:59.111
ARE. THE THREE SCENARIOS. WE

04:05:59.177 --> 04:06:00.779
FRAME WORK. I WON'T BELABOR

04:06:00.846 --> 04:06:03.148
THIS. WE ARE DEFINITELY WORKING

04:06:03.215 --> 04:06:04.850
TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

04:06:04.916 --> 04:06:07.152
SO THAT ALL OF THE FACTS. ARE

04:06:07.219 --> 04:06:09.121
VERY CLEAR ASHER PUBLIC AND

04:06:09.187 --> 04:06:10.989
POLICY MAKERS ABOUT WHAT IT

04:06:11.056 --> 04:06:11.990
WOULD NEED A CLEAN LISTING

04:06:12.057 --> 04:06:13.692
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN PREMIUM

04:06:13.758 --> 04:06:15.827
SUBSIDIES. I'M JUST A HIGH LEVEL

04:06:15.894 --> 04:06:17.662
OF HE DATA POINTS HERE. ON

04:06:17.729 --> 04:06:19.664
AVERAGE OUR ENROLLEES WITH NEWS

04:06:19.731 --> 04:06:21.066
ABOUT A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

04:06:21.133 --> 04:06:23.101
HOUSEHOLD PER MONTH. AND IT

04:06:23.168 --> 04:06:24.836
WOULD BE A TOTAL ANNUAL IMPACT

04:06:24.903 --> 04:06:26.338
OF ABOUT ONE POINT SIX BILLION

04:06:26.404 --> 04:06:30.242
DOLLARS IN PREMIUM SUBSIDIES.

04:06:30.308 --> 04:06:31.276
AND THE REPORT BREAKS DOWN-

04:06:31.343 --> 04:06:33.845
THAT- THE POTENTIAL LOSSES.

04:06:33.912 --> 04:06:36.148
ACROSS OUR INCOME GROUPS AND

04:06:36.214 --> 04:06:37.983
JUSTICE BACKGROUND IF WE NEED TO

04:06:38.049 --> 04:06:40.118
TURN TO THIS AND THINK ABOUT.

04:06:40.185 --> 04:06:43.355
POTENTIALLY AT RESTORING ESTATE

04:06:43.421 --> 04:06:45.490
PREMIUM SUBSIDY PROGRAM IN SOME

04:06:45.557 --> 04:06:48.860
FORM OR FASHION. BUT I WILL MOVE

04:06:48.927 --> 04:06:50.095
TO THE NEXT SCENARIO WHICH IS

04:06:50.162 --> 04:06:52.130
REALLY. WHAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT

04:06:52.197 --> 04:06:53.198
THE CAR SHARING POTENTIAL

04:06:53.265 --> 04:06:55.600

FOLLOWING HIGHLIGHTED YOU

04:07:00.071 --> 04:07:02.007
THINGS. THE MAIN EXHIBIT IN THE

04:07:02.073 --> 04:07:04.442
REPORT. WHAT WE TRIED TO DO HERE

04:07:04.509 --> 04:07:08.113
pDIFFERENCES ON THE OPTIONS ARE

04:07:08.180 --> 04:07:10.882
THAT CAN BE HELPFUL. AND AS YOU

04:07:10.949 --> 04:07:13.952
DIG INTO THEIR AND YOUR TEAMS TO

04:07:14.019 --> 04:07:15.987
THINK ABOUT. A POTENTIAL OPTIONS

04:07:16.054 --> 04:07:17.622
FOR CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE

04:07:17.689 --> 04:07:19.257
FEDERAL FUNDING SLIDES OF THE

04:07:19.324 --> 04:07:24.896
DOLLAR AND THE COST. OUR

04:07:24.963 --> 04:07:25.597
CUSTOMERS ARE HIGHER. AND

04:07:25.664 --> 04:07:26.231
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WHAT

04:07:26.298 --> 04:07:27.432
WE HAVE IN THE STATE. RESEARCH

04:07:27.499 --> 04:07:30.602
NOW. AND I'LL JUST ON THAT TOP

04:07:30.669 --> 04:07:32.771
ROW IT'S OUR MOST GENEROUS

04:07:32.837 --> 04:07:35.140
OPTION. WE ACTUALLY PULLED IT

04:07:35.207 --> 04:07:36.708
FROM SOME MODELING THAT WAS DON

04:07:36.775 --> 04:07:37.842
AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL BY

04:07:37.909 --> 04:07:39.344
RESEARCHERS AT THE URBAN

04:07:39.411 --> 04:07:40.378
INSTITUTE AS THEY WERE LOOKING

04:07:40.445 --> 04:07:42.447
AT POTENTIAL AND NATIONAL

04:07:42.514 --> 04:07:43.982
PROGRAMS TO EXPAND CARSHARING

04:07:44.049 --> 04:07:47.519
SUPPORT MARKET PLACES. AND THIS

04:07:47.586 --> 04:07:50.088
IS THE ONE OPTION WE MODEL THAT

04:07:50.155 --> 04:07:51.756
WOULD PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT TO

04:07:51.823 --> 04:07:54.125
MIDDLE INCOME CONSUMERS UP

04:07:54.192 --> 04:07:55.060
26100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

04:07:55.126 --> 04:07:57.095
LEVEL. AND THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY A

04:07:57.162 --> 04:07:59.297
PRAIRIE STATE WANTED THE PREMIUM

04:07:59.364 --> 04:08:01.266
SUBSIDY PROGRAM TO PROVIDE SOME

04:08:01.333 --> 04:08:02.734
SUPPORT TO MIDDLE INCOME. AND

04:08:02.801 --> 04:08:04.803
PUT ASIDE FROM THAT- I WOULD

04:08:04.869 --> 04:08:08.740
NOTE THAT SHE THINGS-

04:08:08.807 --> 04:08:12.477
DEFINITELY. UPGRADE CARSHARING

04:08:12.544 --> 04:08:14.112
SUPPORT WE HAVE OVER A MILLION

04:08:14.179 --> 04:08:16.915
INDIVIDUALS. AND UNDER 210050%

04:08:16.982 --> 04:08:19.150
OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL

04:08:19.217 --> 04:08:21.186
ELIGIBLE FOR SUPPORT TODAY. I'M

04:08:21.253 --> 04:08:22.587
SO SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN

04:08:22.654 --> 04:08:26.524
UPGRADING. THEIR AFFORDABILITY-

04:08:26.591 --> 04:08:28.593
WE DREW FROM THE STATUTE WHICH

04:08:28.660 --> 04:08:29.828
DEFINITELY ASKED US TO LOOK AT

04:08:29.894 --> 04:08:31.730
THE IMPACT OF DEDUCTIBLES AND WE

04:08:31.796 --> 04:08:32.764
WOULD USE THIS FUNDING TO

04:08:32.831 --> 04:08:34.266
ELIMINATE DEDUCTIBLES IN THE

04:08:34.332 --> 04:08:36.301
PLANS THAT PROVIDE DISCUSSION

04:08:36.368 --> 04:08:39.671
SUPPORT. AND AS YOU SEE THE

04:08:39.738 --> 04:08:40.972
NINETY FIVE NINETY FIVE EIGHTY.

04:08:41.039 --> 04:08:43.174
M. THOSE ARE- SORT OF OUR

04:08:43.241 --> 04:08:45.043
REFERENCE POINT FOR GENEROSITY

04:08:45.110 --> 04:08:48.446
THE PLAN A 95% PLAN WOULD PAY ON

04:08:48.513 --> 04:08:50.548
AVERAGE 95% OF THAT PERSON'S

04:08:50.615 --> 04:08:52.851
AVERAGE EXPECTED COST WHAT IS

04:08:52.917 --> 04:08:54.886
NOT MEAN TARGETS IS THE ABILITY

04:08:54.953 --> 04:08:57.055
TO OFFER BENEFIT PACKAGES. THEY

04:08:57.122 --> 04:08:58.490
GIVE YOU A FIVE DOLLAR PRIMARY

CARE VISIT OUR THREE DOLLAR

04:09:00.025 --> 04:09:02.060
GENERIC DRUG PRESCRIPTIONS SO

04:09:02.127 --> 04:09:06.064
AND THIS WOULD ALL GET-TRANSLATED INTO BENEFIT DESIGNS

04:09:06.131 --> 04:09:07.565
AND THAT LOOK MORE FAMILIAR WHAT

04:09:07.632 --> 04:09:13.338
IS AN EMERGENCY VISIT COSTS BUT. AS A PRIMARY CARE VISIT COST.

04:09:13.405 --> 04:09:14.673
ON TO THIS REPORT. WE DID ROLL

04:09:14.739 --> 04:09:16.675
UP TO THE AGGREGATE SO I'M

04:09:16.741 --> 04:09:19.344
GETTING MEMBERS. UP TO A VERY

04:09:19.411 --> 04:09:22.080
GENEROUS COVERAGE LEVELS. SO

04:09:22.147 --> 04:09:24.416
THAT'S- SORT OF A SOME OF THE

04:09:24.482 --> 04:09:26.518
WAY WE FRAME THE POLICY HERE AND

04:09:26.584 --> 04:09:28.820
SOME OF THAT- THE WASTE COMPARE

04:09:28.887 --> 04:09:32.057
OPTIONS. I'LL PAUSE OWNER- SHE

04:09:32.123 --> 04:09:35.226
NEREO THREE THIS IS. LAW FEDERAL

04:09:35.293 --> 04:09:37.228
GOVERNMENT. EXTENDS PREMIUM

04:09:37.295 --> 04:09:39.531
SUPPORT AMONG THE STATE LOOKS TO

04:09:39.597 --> 04:09:42.667
ENHANCE CARSHARING SUPPORT WE

04:09:42.734 --> 04:09:44.436
OFFER FOUR OPTIONS IN YOUR

04:09:44.502 --> 04:09:48.139
REPORT- DRAWN LARGELY FROM THE

04:09:48.206 --> 04:09:49.641
STATUTE. IN MOST OF THESE

04:09:49.708 --> 04:09:51.910
OPTIONS TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY

04:09:51.976 --> 04:09:53.545
FOR INDIVIDUALS UP 24100% OF THE

04:09:53.611 --> 04:09:55.847
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL CAN HAVE

04:09:55.914 --> 04:09:57.949
CAR SHARING SUPPORT. AT LEAST

04:09:58.016 --> 04:10:00.118
THE GOLD LEVEL SO PLAN PAYING ON

04:10:00.185 --> 04:10:05.890
AVERAGE. IN THAT TOP ROW THAT

04:10:05.957 --> 04:10:07.258
MOST GENEROUS YOU'D BE MAKING

04:10:07.325 --> 04:10:09.494
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND TO

04:10:09.561 --> 04:10:10.762
REDUCE COST SHARING FOR

04:10:10.829 --> 04:10:12.263
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE

04:10:12.330 --> 04:10:14.399
TODAY FOR FEDERAL SUPPORT. AND

04:10:14.466 --> 04:10:16.234
SO WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE THOSE

04:10:16.301 --> 04:10:18.470
INVESTMENTS. AND THEN OFFER

04:10:18.536 --> 04:10:20.305
BRAND NEW SUPPORT TO THE

04:10:20.372 --> 04:10:21.306
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

04:10:21.373 --> 04:10:23.508
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ABOVE

04:10:23.575 --> 04:10:26.177
210050% UP 24100% OF THE FEDERAL

04:10:26.244 --> 04:10:28.146
POVERTY LEVEL. TO PROVIDE THEM

04:10:28.213 --> 04:10:29.247
QUESTIONING SUPPORT FOR THE

04:10:29.314 --> 04:10:31.816
FIRST TIME. AND AGAIN ALSO

04:10:31.883 --> 04:10:35.787
ELIMINATING DEDUCTIBLES. ALL

04:10:35.854 --> 04:10:36.821
OPTION FIVE IS A LITTLE

04:10:36.888 --> 04:10:38.289
DIFFERENT THAT WOULD JUST FOCUS

04:10:38.356 --> 04:10:39.791
ON INDIVIDUALS WERE ELIGIBLE

04:10:39.858 --> 04:10:40.825
TODAY AND PROVIDE THEM AN

04:10:40.892 --> 04:10:43.395
UPGRADE. AND YOU MIGHT SAY THAT

04:10:43.461 --> 04:10:46.164
THAT LOOKS KIND OF EXPENSIVE-

04:10:46.231 --> 04:10:47.766
CONSIDERING THAT IT IT DOESN'T

04:10:47.832 --> 04:10:49.901
EXPAND A LEGIBILITY. I WOULD

04:10:49.968 --> 04:10:52.337
JUST NOTE THAT WE HAVE- AND

04:10:52.404 --> 04:10:53.805
QUITE A FEW ENROLLEES IN THAT

04:10:53.872 --> 04:10:55.974
INCOME RANGE SO YOU'D BE

04:10:56.040 --> 04:10:58.543
INVESTING IN. A LOT OF PEOPLE

04:10:58.610 --> 04:11:00.111
THEY'RE JUST ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR

04:11:00.178 --> 04:11:03.415
FEDERAL SUPPORT DAY- STEPPING

04:11:03.481 --> 04:11:06.451
DOWN ONE A LITTLE BIT LESS ANA.

04:11:06.518 --> 04:11:08.420
UPGRADE FOR EXISTING ELIGIBLES

04:11:08.486 --> 04:11:09.487
THAT WOULD REALLY FOCUS ON

04:11:09.554 --> 04:11:11.189
EXPANDING THAT BENEFITS TO

04:11:11.256 --> 04:11:14.292
PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TODAY-

04:11:14.359 --> 04:11:15.193
AND THEN WE DID IT BECAUSE OF

04:11:15.260 --> 04:11:17.295
THE EMPHASIS STATUTE IN THE

04:11:17.362 --> 04:11:18.763
DISCUSSIONS WE HAD WITH OUR

04:11:18.830 --> 04:11:20.432
STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THE IMPACT.

04:11:20.498 --> 04:11:22.267
AND DEDUCTIBLES MAY PLAY IN

04:11:22.333 --> 04:11:24.035
DETERRING BY DETERRING FOLKS

04:11:24.102 --> 04:11:25.970
FROM SIGNING UP. FOR DETERRING

04:11:26.037 --> 04:11:27.839
THEM FROM USING IT CARE WANTS TO

04:11:27.906 --> 04:11:30.175
SIGN UP. WE DID PROVIDE JUST AN

04:11:30.241 --> 04:11:31.810
ISOLATED OPTION THAT SAYS WHAT

04:11:31.876 --> 04:11:33.645
IF WE JUST USE FUNDS. TO

04:11:33.711 --> 04:11:36.381
ELIMINATE DEDUCTIBLES IN OUR- IN

04:11:36.448 --> 04:11:38.049
OUR COST SHARING REDUCTION PLANS

04:11:38.116 --> 04:11:39.617
SO THAT NOBODY IN THIS PLANT HAS

04:11:39.684 --> 04:11:40.418
TO WORRY ABOUT HAVING A

04:11:40.485 --> 04:11:44.122
DEDUCTIBLE FOR ANY SERVICES. AND

04:11:44.189 --> 04:11:46.224
IN THAT CONNECTION. AN ORDER OF

04:11:46.291 --> 04:11:48.793
MAGNITUDE LOWER THAN SOME OF OUR

04:11:48.860 --> 04:11:50.228
OTHER OPTIONS. AND NOT JUST A

04:11:50.295 --> 04:11:51.696
LITTLE BIT OF A WORD ABOUT THE

04:11:51.763 --> 04:11:54.799
RANGE OF COSTS HERE- THESE COSTS

04:11:54.866 --> 04:11:56.801
WOULD VARY BASED ON OUR EXISTING

04:11:56.868 --> 04:11:59.337
ENROLLEES. MOVING FROM THE PLANS

04:11:59.404 --> 04:12:00.472
THAT THEY'RE IN SOME OF THOSE

04:12:00.538 --> 04:12:02.507
OLYMPIC MEDAL TIERS BRONZE GOLD

04:12:02.574 --> 04:12:04.509
AND PLATINUM. INTO THE SILVER

04:12:04.576 --> 04:12:06.311
PLANS WHERE WE OFFER THESE COST

04:12:06.377 --> 04:12:08.012
SHARING REDUCTIONS SO IT WOULD

04:12:08.079 --> 04:12:09.814
REQUIRE INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE

04:12:09.881 --> 04:12:12.550
PLANS- COVER CALIFORNIA TO DO

04:12:12.617 --> 04:12:20.191
OUTREACH- AND ALSO. I THINK

04:12:20.258 --> 04:12:21.493
PASSED TO- I DO SOME WORK WITH

04:12:21.559 --> 04:12:23.194
OUR YOU IN ROLE USED TO GET THEM

04:12:23.261 --> 04:12:24.562
INTO THOSE SOBRE PLANS TAKE

04:12:24.629 --> 04:12:26.030
ADVANTAGE THAT. THANKS A LOT THE

04:12:26.097 --> 04:12:28.266
RANGE OF CARS YOU SEEN TRULY.

04:12:28.333 --> 04:12:30.335
AND EXISTING IN. AND TRYING TO

04:12:30.401 --> 04:12:32.003
GET THEM INTO PLANS THAT WOULD

04:12:32.070 --> 04:12:34.572
GIVE THEM EACH OUT OF POCKET

04:12:34.639 --> 04:12:37.041
EXPENSE. OUR LAST SUBSTANCE

04:12:37.108 --> 04:12:38.776
FLIGHT HERE CONSIDERATIONS FOR

04:12:38.843 --> 04:12:40.245
IMPLEMENTATION ON TIGHTENING WE

04:12:40.311 --> 04:12:41.613
DID APPRECIATE THE MARGINAL

04:12:41.679 --> 04:12:43.548
STATUTE TO D. DELVE DEEPLY INTO

04:12:43.615 --> 04:12:45.183
OPERATIONS I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

04:12:45.250 --> 04:12:47.719
THE DETAIL HERE. BUT WE DID DO

04:12:47.785 --> 04:12:49.521
THAT HAS A VERY GOOD DISCUSSIONS

04:12:49.587 --> 04:12:52.690
I THINK- THAT GIVEN US. A GOOD

04:12:52.757 --> 04:12:54.959
HEAD START ON PLANNING HERE

04:12:55.026 --> 04:12:56.528
OBVIOUSLY IF WE TRY TO LAUNCH A

04:12:56.594 --> 04:12:58.796
PROGRAM FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE

04:12:58.863 --> 04:13:00.398
AND SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD TO

04:13:00.465 --> 04:13:01.633
COMPRESSED TIME FRAME AND WILL

04:13:01.699 --> 04:13:03.601
NEED A LOT OF DECISIONS. IN THE

04:13:03.668 --> 04:13:06.104
FIRST HALF OF THE CALENDAR YEAR-

04:13:06.170 --> 04:13:07.805
THAT SAID WE THAT WE KNOW THAT

04:13:07.872 --> 04:13:09.607
WE WERE CONSCIOUS OF THE FEDERAL

04:13:09.674 --> 04:13:11.142
UNCERTAINTY SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO

04:13:11.209 --> 04:13:12.710
WORK CLOSELY WITH THE

04:13:12.777 --> 04:13:13.177
ADMINISTRATION AND THE

04:13:13.244 --> 04:13:15.713
LEGISLATURE TO- PROVIDE OPTIONS

04:13:15.780 --> 04:13:17.916
ARE FINE OPTIONS AS WE GET MORE

04:13:17.982 --> 04:13:19.817
CLARITY ABOUT FEDERAL FUNDING.

04:13:19.884 --> 04:13:21.519
AND BUT WE WILL BE WORKING IN

04:13:21.586 --> 04:13:24.522
THE- I'M ON OUR SIDE- TO DO AS

04:13:24.589 --> 04:13:26.157
MUCH PREPARATION AS WE CAN SO

04:13:26.224 --> 04:13:28.259
THAT IF WE DO HAVE. AND FEDERAL

04:13:28.326 --> 04:13:30.528
FUNDING YOU CAN MOVE QUICKLY TO

04:13:30.595 --> 04:13:32.730
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT- AND IF

04:13:32.797 --> 04:13:35.733
WE DON'T WE CAN BE READY. FOR

04:13:35.800 --> 04:13:37.869
POTENTIAL STATE OPTIONS. BUT

04:13:37.936 --> 04:13:43.541
THAT'LL STOP THE SLIDES WILL.

04:13:43.608 --> 04:13:44.108
TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU

04:13:44.175 --> 04:13:45.109
HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I

04:13:45.176 --> 04:13:46.844
WOULD NOTE TO THE PUB THAT WE-

04:13:46.911 --> 04:13:48.179
MAKE SURE WE LIST THOSE SLIDES

04:13:48.246 --> 04:13:49.614
BECAUSE SINCE IT WAS OF MUCH

04:13:49.681 --> 04:13:50.615
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS BEEN-

04:13:50.682 --> 04:13:51.816
PUT PUT UP ON THE WEBSITE- BY

AND I THINK- YOU KNOW WE

04:13:56.087 --> 04:13:56.688
CERTAINLY HOPE THE FEDS ARE ABLE

04:13:56.754 --> 04:13:59.557
TO HELP OUT. BUT I KNOW FROM FOR

04:13:59.624 --> 04:14:01.159
ME AND I KNOW THE PRO TEM AND I

04:14:01.225 --> 04:14:03.595
SERRANO THE BUDGET CHAIR. WE

04:14:03.661 --> 04:14:07.131
HAVE A- THE- BIG EMPHASIS. ON

04:14:07.198 --> 04:14:08.800
REDUCING POVERTY AND HELPING AS

04:14:08.866 --> 04:14:11.269
MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SO. I

04:14:11.336 --> 04:14:13.304
CAN SEE IS. IF WE NEED TO DO.

04:14:13.371 --> 04:14:14.639
MOVING VERY QUICKLY TO BE ABLE

04:14:14.706 --> 04:14:16.474
TO. HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE

04:14:16.541 --> 04:14:17.809
POSSIBLY CAN WE DO NOT WANT THE

04:14:17.875 --> 04:14:19.310
COST OF HEALTH CARE. TO BE

04:14:19.377 --> 04:14:21.012
SOMETHING THAT KEEPS PEOPLE.

04:14:21.079 --> 04:14:22.347
FROM MAKING SURE THEY GET THAT

04:14:22.413 --> 04:14:25.416
PREVENTIVE CARE- AND THEIR DAILY

04:14:25.483 --> 04:14:27.018
NEEDS DONE SO IT DOESN'T COST

04:14:27.085 --> 04:14:29.120
US. WAY MORE ON THE OTHER SIDE.

04:14:29.187 --> 04:14:31.389
SO I APPRECIATE- IRAQ IS LIGHT

04:14:31.456 --> 04:14:32.624
AND THAT YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK AT

04:14:32.690 --> 04:14:34.125
THIS. AND THAT HOPEFULLY IT

04:14:34.192 --> 04:14:35.460
MEANS YOU CAN BE WE CAN BE READY

04:14:35.526 --> 04:14:37.295
TO ROLL AS SOON AS WE NEED TO-

04:14:37.362 --> 04:14:39.030
AND- THEN WE CERTAINLY COMMITTEE

04:14:39.097 --> 04:14:40.832
THAT WILL BE WORKING- THE

04:14:40.898 --> 04:14:42.300
FACTORY SO WE CAN MAKE SOME

04:14:42.367 --> 04:14:44.836
DECISIONS AS SOON AS WE NEED TO

04:14:44.902 --> 04:14:46.104
MAKE THEM. LOOK BETTER YOU CAN

04:14:46.170 --> 04:14:47.305
CHECK. I DO HAVE SEVERAL.

04:14:47.372 --> 04:14:49.507
MISHAPS WE CAN HEAVILY- ELEMENT

04:14:49.574 --> 04:14:51.376
. HOUSING FINANCE AND THEN I'LL

04:14:51.442 --> 04:14:55.313
ASK THIS. W. MOREOVER THE

04:14:55.380 --> 04:14:58.216
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE

04:14:58.282 --> 04:15:00.184
WILL BE ABLE TO FIND A MORE IN

04:15:00.251 --> 04:15:01.252
DEPTH ANALYSIS IN THE COMING

04:15:01.319 --> 04:15:02.453
WEEKS BUT I DID WANT TO RAISE A

04:15:02.520 --> 04:15:04.355
FEW ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION NOT

04:15:04.422 --> 04:15:06.424
ALL FORCE OBVIOUSLY IS THAT IT'S

04:15:06.491 --> 04:15:07.759
ABOUT OFFERING SERVICES SOME OF

04:15:07.825 --> 04:15:09.360
THESE ARE NOT EXTENDED WOULD

04:15:09.427 --> 04:15:11.062
MOST LIKELY BE THE MOST

04:15:11.129 --> 04:15:14.265
IMPACTFUL WAY- OF. IMPACTING

04:15:14.332 --> 04:15:17.969
AFFORDABILITY- AND TO THE EXTENT

04:15:18.036 --> 04:15:18.770
THAT FEDERAL SUBSIDIES ARE

04:15:18.836 --> 04:15:20.905
CONTINUED I AM CONSIDERING

04:15:20.972 --> 04:15:22.206
ADDITIONAL AFFORDABILITY OPTIONS

04:15:22.273 --> 04:15:23.808
ARE FEW THINGS A LOGICAL WHEN

04:15:23.875 --> 04:15:27.045
YOU CONSIDER FIRST IS- WHAT THEY

04:15:27.111 --> 04:15:33.718
CALL ON- I DRESS IN. INCOME IT

04:15:33.785 --> 04:15:35.687
WOULDN'T BE AN WHAT THE WILL THE

04:15:35.753 --> 04:15:37.588
ON WITH THOSE GOALS. SO FOR

04:15:37.655 --> 04:15:39.457
EXAMPLE IF THE GOAL IS TO

04:15:39.524 --> 04:15:40.425
PROMOTE FOR ILLEGAL IT CAN

04:15:40.491 --> 04:15:42.393
BECOME CONSUMERS FOCUSING ON

04:15:42.460 --> 04:15:44.429
APPROACHES THAT TARGET.

04:15:44.495 --> 04:15:46.230
CONSUMERS WITH INCOMES BELOW

04:15:46.297 --> 04:15:47.832
210050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

04:15:47.899 --> 04:15:49.834
LEVEL MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE. WHAT

04:15:49.901 --> 04:15:51.069
IF THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE

04:15:51.135 --> 04:15:52.737
ABILITY FOR THE BUT THE TWO AND

04:15:52.804 --> 04:15:55.573
50% OF THAT P. L. ON INCLUDING

04:15:55.640 --> 04:15:57.842
DOES NOT CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR

04:15:57.909 --> 04:15:59.677
THE TOTAL COSTS AND REDUCTIONS.

04:15:59.744 --> 04:16:01.079
ON THE SIDE TO SOME OF THE ONES

04:16:01.145 --> 04:16:02.313
MOST LIKELY TO ENROLL IN THE

04:16:02.380 --> 04:16:04.248
BRONZE KINDS CURRENTLY A

04:16:04.315 --> 04:16:05.983
DIFFERENT APPROACH MIGHT BE MORE

04:16:06.050 --> 04:16:06.884
APPROPRIATE AND THEN FINALLY THE

04:16:06.951 --> 04:16:08.052
BATTLE COULD BE TO DRIVE NEW

04:16:08.119 --> 04:16:09.153
ENROLLMENT FOR THE SHIFT IN ROLE

04:16:09.220 --> 04:16:19.063
IS TO MORE- GENEROUS. PLANS NEXT

04:16:19.130 --> 04:16:20.164
FAILED. WEATHER THAN TOP THE

04:16:20.231 --> 04:16:21.165
TIME FRAME IS FOR THE- OF

04:16:21.232 --> 04:16:22.900
PROGRAM. SO THE CHILDREN COULD

04:16:22.967 --> 04:16:24.702
CONSIDER- A ONE TIME PROGRAM. TO

04:16:24.769 --> 04:16:25.770
FOR HIM OR SOMETHING GONNA GO.

04:16:25.837 --> 04:16:27.271
WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO PROGRAM

04:16:27.338 --> 04:16:30.274
ARTISTIC LIST RESEARCH. BUT NO.

04:16:30.341 --> 04:16:32.176
FOR BUT EXTRACTION THE MEASURE

04:16:32.243 --> 04:16:34.112
COST TO IMPLEMENT THAT PLAN AND

04:16:34.178 --> 04:16:35.646
COMMUNICATE THE PROGRAM TO

04:16:35.713 --> 04:16:41.519
POTENTIAL. CONSUMERS- WHEN THE

04:16:41.586 --> 04:16:43.554
LARGER SAME ALLEN TALKING FOR

04:16:43.621 --> 04:16:45.556
COMPARE ON PROBE. AT ALL RESULT

04:16:45.623 --> 04:16:47.291
IN A INJURY. FOR WHICH CAUSE

04:16:47.358 --> 04:16:48.359
COULD COULD BENEFIT FOR THE PLAN

04:16:48.426 --> 04:16:49.660
OR EVEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

04:16:49.727 --> 04:16:52.430
OF IT MY ROLLING INTO IT. GOING

04:16:52.497 --> 04:16:55.299
TO BE WHAT LEVEL OF FUNDING TO

04:16:55.366 --> 04:16:56.901
PROVIDE. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

04:16:56.968 --> 04:16:58.102
ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

04:16:58.169 --> 04:16:59.203
ADDITIONAL COSTS IN THE

04:16:59.270 --> 04:17:01.072
REDUCTIONS COULD FIND ASSISTANCE

04:17:01.139 --> 04:17:02.507
WITH PAYING FOR THESE ADDITIONAL

04:17:02.573 --> 04:17:04.208
AFFORDABILITY OPTIONS THERE'S

04:17:04.275 --> 04:17:05.777
ALSO A ONE TIME FUNDING OF THREE

04:17:05.843 --> 04:17:06.744
HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE POINT

04:17:06.811 --> 04:17:07.678
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS SENATE

04:17:07.745 --> 04:17:09.914
SIGNED. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT

04:17:09.981 --> 04:17:11.749
COULD BE EXTENDED I WANNA LET

04:17:11.816 --> 04:17:13.351
YOU TURN BASIS OR IN THE FUTURE

04:17:13.417 --> 04:17:15.386
LEADERS AND THEN FINDING THE

04:17:15.453 --> 04:17:16.687
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER A-

04:17:16.754 --> 04:17:20.992
APPROVING ADDITIONAL. GENERAL

04:17:21.058 --> 04:17:21.893
FUND REVENUE TO PROVIDE. SO FOR

04:17:21.959 --> 04:17:25.530
THESE FOR A- AND THEN FINALLY-

04:17:25.596 --> 04:17:26.464
WILL NOT AROUND TYPE OF

04:17:26.531 --> 04:17:28.666
KHASHOGGI TARGET THE OPTIONS AND

04:17:28.733 --> 04:17:29.634
REPORT GENERALLY FOCUS ON

04:17:29.700 --> 04:17:31.002
ELIMINATING OR REDUCING

04:17:31.068 --> 04:17:33.538
DEDUCTIBLES OR MOVING CONSUMERS

04:17:33.604 --> 04:17:35.606
ENGINE ONE GENEROUS PLANS CAN

04:17:35.673 --> 04:17:36.774
IMPACT POSSIBLE TO ALWAYS

04:17:36.841 --> 04:17:40.878
INCLUDE THE DEDUCTIBLES. AND THE

04:17:40.945 --> 04:17:42.213
MAXIMUM OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES.

04:17:42.280 --> 04:17:44.916
THE MOST OF THE PLAN OPTIONS THE

04:17:44.982 --> 04:17:47.151
BORDER INVOLVED NOT MOVE A LOT

04:17:47.218 --> 04:17:50.988
OF TROUBLES. IN THIS ORDER IN

04:17:51.055 --> 04:17:53.658
HOLLAND IN PATIENT CARE- I.

04:17:53.724 --> 04:17:55.159
JOHNSON WHERE THE GENITALS OF

04:17:55.226 --> 04:17:59.997
HIGH. END COVERED CALIFORNIA. I

04:18:00.064 --> 04:18:00.665
THINK IT'S TOO MUCH NOT MUCH PAY

04:18:00.731 --> 04:18:02.333
CARE OF BENEFIT TO FROM THE READ

04:18:02.400 --> 04:18:04.802
OR A DOUBLE HOWEVER THAT IF YOU

04:18:04.869 --> 04:18:07.305
DO. A CARE CAN AND PAYING VERY

04:18:07.371 --> 04:18:09.607
HIGH CALL. AS A RESULT OF THESE

04:18:09.674 --> 04:18:11.542
DOCTORS AND IN ADDITION TO

04:18:11.609 --> 04:18:13.144
CONSUMERS PERCEIVED COSTA

ENROLLING PLANS OR SEEKING CARE

04:18:16.681 --> 04:18:18.449
INCLUDING SERVICE FOR SERVICE'S

04:18:18.516 --> 04:18:23.721
SADDAM DID. NOT NECESSARILY HAVE

04:18:23.788 --> 04:18:25.690
TO DOUBLE. IT ALSO IS COSTLY

04:18:25.756 --> 04:18:27.425
THAN OTHER THAN SOME OF THE

04:18:27.491 --> 04:18:28.359
OTHER OPTIONS THAT WOULD NOT.

04:18:28.426 --> 04:18:31.896
REQUIRE THE FULL ELIMINATION OF

04:18:31.963 --> 04:18:33.764
DEDUCTIBLES. THERE'S ONLY ONE

04:18:33.831 --> 04:18:38.135
OPTION IN THE REPORT THAT. WOULD

04:18:38.202 --> 04:18:40.872
MAINTAIN DEDUCTIBLES THAT WOULD

04:18:40.938 --> 04:18:42.506
SHIP CONSUMERS INTO THE MORE

04:18:42.573 --> 04:18:44.108
GENEROUS PLAN WHICH WOULD WE

04:18:44.175 --> 04:18:46.210
GENERALLY WE DO TO DOUBLE THE

04:18:46.277 --> 04:18:47.612
ORDER CALDERON MARKETING

04:18:47.678 --> 04:18:52.049
EXPENSES BUT THEY WOULD STILL

04:18:52.116 --> 04:18:52.817
HAVE TO PAY SOME CHARITABLE.

04:18:52.884 --> 04:18:54.385
THIS WOULD SUBJECT TO LOWER

04:18:54.452 --> 04:18:55.653
COSTS OF IT WOULD NOT

04:18:55.720 --> 04:18:57.255
NECESSARILY ON THE LEVEL OF

04:18:57.321 --> 04:18:58.256
BENEFIT IN TERMS OF

04:18:58.322 --> 04:19:00.291
AFFORDABILITY THAT THE OPTIONS

04:19:00.358 --> 04:19:03.261
ARE REMOVED HOLES WOULD HAVE.

04:19:03.327 --> 04:19:08.065
BEEN K. BERMAN FINANCING HAVE

04:19:08.132 --> 04:19:12.970
ANYTHING. BURKE OTHER CORPORATE

04:19:13.037 --> 04:19:15.172
APARTMENT OF FINANCE. ONLY THE

04:19:15.239 --> 04:19:16.507
OTHER THE ADMINISTRATION IS IN

04:19:16.574 --> 04:19:18.709
THE PROCESS OF EXAMINING THE

04:19:18.776 --> 04:19:20.244
OPTIONS PROVIDED IN THE REPORT

04:19:20.311 --> 04:19:22.246
AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO MONITOR

04:19:22.313 --> 04:19:24.916
THE FEDERAL SITUATION- AND WILL

04:19:24.982 --> 04:19:27.818
BE DEVELOPING AN OPTIONS

04:19:27.885 --> 04:19:29.287
DEPENDING ON THE FEDERAL ACTIONS

04:19:29.353 --> 04:19:30.521
. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TALK TO

04:19:30.588 --> 04:19:32.823
PAM. THANK YOU. AND AGAIN

04:19:32.890 --> 04:19:35.092
PRECIADO THE PRESENTATION AND

04:19:35.159 --> 04:19:37.795
THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS- GUESS.

04:19:37.862 --> 04:19:39.263
WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK

04:19:39.330 --> 04:19:41.332
WE ALSO SHOULD BE CONSIDERING IS

04:19:41.399 --> 04:19:43.901
THAT- BECAUSE ABILITY OF THE

04:19:43.968 --> 04:19:45.436
MARKET RATE AND SO COVER

04:19:45.503 --> 04:19:46.170
CALIFORNIA'S AN ACTIVE

04:19:46.237 --> 04:19:49.073
PURCHASER- IT'S NEGOTIATING THE

04:19:49.140 --> 04:19:52.510
RATES. AND THE MORE UNCERTAINTY

04:19:52.576 --> 04:19:54.445
THERE IS- USUALLY THE MORE

04:19:54.512 --> 04:19:56.314
EXPENSIVE THINGS KEPT HER EIGHT

04:19:56.380 --> 04:19:58.282
BECAUSE EACH OF THE PLANS HAS TO

04:19:58.349 --> 04:19:59.984
BACON THE UNCERTAINTY INTO THEIR

04:20:00.051 --> 04:20:01.152
RATES AND OF COURSE IF THERE'S

04:20:01.218 --> 04:20:02.820
MORE UNCERTAINTY YOU'RE GOING TO

04:20:02.887 --> 04:20:04.989
BE MORE CAUTIOUS AND- SO I.

04:20:05.056 --> 04:20:08.292
THINK THAT- YEAH WE NEED TO TAKE

04:20:08.359 --> 04:20:10.962
THAT INTO ACCOUNT- I ALSO WAY

04:20:11.028 --> 04:20:13.464
TALK ABOUT STABILITY. I THINK

04:20:13.531 --> 04:20:15.132
WOULD BE CHALLENGING FOR EXAMPLE

04:20:15.199 --> 04:20:19.837
TO PUT. FUNDS IN ON ONE YEAR AND

04:20:19.904 --> 04:20:21.339
THEN NOT HAVE THE FUNDS THE

04:20:21.405 --> 04:20:22.440
FOLLOWING YEAR AND THEN PULL

04:20:22.506 --> 04:20:24.008
BACK ALL RIGHT SO OBVIOUSLY WE

04:20:24.075 --> 04:20:25.476
HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHAT

04:20:25.543 --> 04:20:27.478
HAPPENS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. SO

04:20:27.545 --> 04:20:28.879
PRECIADO THE AMERICAN RESCUE

04:20:28.946 --> 04:20:31.949
PLAN RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW WE

04:20:32.016 --> 04:20:33.718
CAN WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN

04:20:33.784 --> 04:20:34.952
TO BUILD BACK BETTER WEATHER

04:20:35.019 --> 04:20:37.221
SOME COMPONENT WHAT HAPPENS IF

04:20:37.288 --> 04:20:38.823
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT SAFE

04:20:38.889 --> 04:20:40.391
PASSES A BILL THAT BETTER WITH

04:20:40.458 --> 04:20:42.226
ONLY ONE YEAR ADDITIONAL TO

04:20:42.293 --> 04:20:47.098
THAT. AND SO I THINK WE ALWAYS

04:20:47.164 --> 04:20:48.265
NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S OUR

04:20:48.332 --> 04:20:50.334
STATE CAPACITY I MEAN UNLESS DAY

04:20:50.401 --> 04:20:51.469
ACTUALLY PASS SOMETHING SAID YOU

04:20:51.535 --> 04:20:52.570
KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

FARTHER ON THE HORIZON. I GUESS

04:21:01.679 --> 04:21:03.247

UP FOR. AS MUCH AS WE CAN. WHAT

04:21:13.257 --> 04:21:15.493
WOULD HAPPEN IF. THE PROGRAM

04:21:15.559 --> 04:21:17.228
ENDS AND DOESN'T GET FUNDED

04:21:17.294 --> 04:21:18.496

ACTUALLY HAVE STAYED. STABLE

04:21:39.383 --> 04:21:41.118
INTACT THAT'S BEEN UNDER 1% FOR

04:21:41.185 --> 04:21:43.054
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS ETCETERA

04:21:43.120 --> 04:21:45.656
THAT'S A GREAT STORY. SO BE ABLE

04:21:45.723 --> 04:21:46.791
TO CONTINUE THAT STORY IS GONNA

04:21:46.857 --> 04:21:48.726
BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND SO THE

04:21:48.793 --> 04:21:50.761
FEWER SWINGS WE HAVE SO WHAT IS

04:21:50.828 --> 04:21:51.629
I GUESS WHEN THE QUESTIONS I

04:21:51.695 --> 04:21:53.197

CALIFORNIA IS THAT- YOU KNOW

OPTIONS AND I GUESS YOU GOT

04:22:00.471 --> 04:22:01.906
THREE JOBS AND SO FORTH BUT- YOU

04:22:01.972 --> 04:22:03.040
KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD

04:22:03.107 --> 04:22:04.308
BE THE THING THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

04:22:04.375 --> 04:22:06.310
LEAD TO THE MOST STABILITY IN

04:22:06.377 --> 04:22:07.278
THE MARKET WOULD THAT THAT WOULD

04:22:07.344 --> 04:22:08.546
GIVE COVER CALIFORNIA MOST

04:22:08.612 --> 04:22:09.880
ADVANTAGEOUS NEGOTIATING

04:22:09.947 --> 04:22:11.215
POSITION LET'S SAY ASSUMING THE

04:22:11.282 --> 04:22:12.783
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T. PASS

04:22:12.850 --> 04:22:14.718
BUILD BACK BETTER. I MEAN I'M

04:22:14.785 --> 04:22:16.253
I'M CERTAINLY HOPING THEY WILL

04:22:16.320 --> 04:22:17.588
RELEASE THIS COMPONENT OF IT YOU

04:22:17.655 --> 04:22:18.322
KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY HOPING

04:22:18.389 --> 04:22:19.323
PASSABLE BACK BETTER ALL

04:22:19.390 --> 04:22:20.424
TOGETHER BUT THAT'S ANOTHER

04:22:20.491 --> 04:22:22.393
STORY. YOU KNOW IT'S A THIS

04:22:22.460 --> 04:22:23.060
PARTICULAR COMPONENT THIS

04:22:23.127 --> 04:22:24.395
PREDICAMENT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND I

04:22:24.462 --> 04:22:25.329
WOULD THINK THAT IF YOU DON'T

04:22:25.396 --> 04:22:27.131
PASS IT BY THE TIME WE PASS OUR

04:22:27.198 --> 04:22:28.399
BUDGET I DON'T THINK IT'S

04:22:28.466 --> 04:22:29.700
HAPPENING IT'S ELECTION YEAR.

04:22:29.767 --> 04:22:31.735
BUT WHAT WOULD DO WHAT WOULD

04:22:31.802 --> 04:22:33.971
ACTUALLY POSE IN THE BEST

04:22:34.038 --> 04:22:35.573
POSITION WHEN IT COMES TO.

04:22:35.639 --> 04:22:37.441
NEGOTIATING WITH THE PLANS AND

04:22:37.508 --> 04:22:38.976
KNOWING THE PLANS KNOWING THAT

04:22:39.043 --> 04:22:40.544
OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAD WE

04:22:40.611 --> 04:22:42.580
KNOW WHAT THE CASE MIX WILL BE

04:22:42.646 --> 04:22:43.614
RIGHT BECAUSE OF THEIR SHIFTING

04:22:43.681 --> 04:22:45.182
THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS YOU HAVE

04:22:45.249 --> 04:22:46.684
DIFFERENT CASE MIX THINGS THAT

04:22:46.750 --> 04:22:49.386
HAPPENED AS WELL. SO IT WAS HOW

04:22:49.453 --> 04:22:50.688
IS THAT FACTORED IN INTO THE

04:22:50.754 --> 04:22:55.659
REPORT AND- WHAT. WOULD YOU SAY

04:22:55.726 --> 04:22:56.961
TO THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. AT ANY

04:22:57.027 --> 04:22:59.063
. I THINK YOU. YOU IT IN TERMS.

04:22:59.130 --> 04:23:01.432
THE LOSS OF PREMIUM SUBSIDIES-

04:23:01.499 --> 04:23:02.566
HOW CONSIDER INDIVIDUAL

04:23:02.633 --> 04:23:04.201
CONSUMERS WOULD FEEL THAT WHEN

04:23:04.268 --> 04:23:05.870
THEY- GET THOSE RENEWAL LETTERS

04:23:05.936 --> 04:23:08.439
IN OCTOBER OBVIOUSLY LOOKING AT.

04:23:08.506 --> 04:23:11.108
INCREASES IN OUR PLANS LOOKING

04:23:11.175 --> 04:23:12.977
AT- ICING FOR THAT UNCERTAINTY

04:23:13.043 --> 04:23:14.612
WILL THOSE CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN

04:23:14.678 --> 04:23:16.614
ADDED ON TO THE A. R. P. PREMIUM

04:23:16.680 --> 04:23:20.384
SUBSIDIES AND DROP- SO I THINK-

04:23:20.451 --> 04:23:22.453
LOOKING AT AT STEEP PREMIUMS

04:23:22.520 --> 04:23:26.223
SUBSIDIES. IN SOME FASHION- IS

04:23:26.290 --> 04:23:29.393
PROBABLY THE THING THAT WOULD-

04:23:29.460 --> 04:23:32.029
ABI FOCUSED ON MARKET STABILITY

04:23:32.096 --> 04:23:35.766
THE MOST- ARE ENROLLEES THE BULK

04:23:35.833 --> 04:23:37.501
OF OUR ENROLLEES ARE ON THE

04:23:37.568 --> 04:23:39.470
LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE SO

04:23:39.537 --> 04:23:41.639
WE DO THAT'S PART OF THE REASON

04:23:41.705 --> 04:23:43.274
THAT WE PROVIDE THOSE.

04:23:43.340 --> 04:23:44.875
INCREMENTS IN THE REPORTS THAT

04:23:44.942 --> 04:23:46.110
YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE COST WOULD

04:23:46.177 --> 04:23:48.145
BE TO DO THAT BACK FILLED BY

04:23:48.212 --> 04:23:50.748
INCOME GROUPS AND THAT THE BUT

04:23:50.814 --> 04:23:53.317
AGAIN AS THE L. A. O. MENTION.

04:23:53.384 --> 04:23:54.485
COULD START TO THINK ABOUT

04:23:54.552 --> 04:23:56.687
PRIORITIES BY INCOME GROUPS AND

04:23:56.754 --> 04:24:00.457
BEEN AND WHERE THE BULK OF OUR

04:24:00.524 --> 04:24:01.959
ENROLLEES ARE. THE SORT OF

04:24:02.026 --> 04:24:03.427
CUSHION NINE LOS GENERAL TENT

04:24:03.494 --> 04:24:05.196
CITIES. AND ADDRESSING THE

04:24:05.262 --> 04:24:07.031
UNCERTAINTY THAT YOU'RE PLANNING

04:24:07.097 --> 04:24:08.566
TO BUY OR ACTUALLY FOR EXAMPLE

04:24:08.632 --> 04:24:11.635
THE LOSS OF THE SUBSIDIES ARE

04:24:11.702 --> 04:24:13.070
BIGGEST IMPACT ACTION THE HIGHER

04:24:13.137 --> 04:24:14.471
INCOME GROUP BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY

04:24:14.538 --> 04:24:16.140
ONCE YOU HAD OVER FOUR HUNDRED

04:24:16.207 --> 04:24:17.741
SO RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE-

04:24:17.808 --> 04:24:19.510
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. PEOPLE

04:24:19.577 --> 04:24:21.078
BEYOND 4100% OF THE FEDERAL

04:24:21.145 --> 04:24:22.479
POVERTY LEVEL WHICH BY THE WAY

04:24:22.546 --> 04:24:23.681
OF COURSE IS THE FEDERAL POVERTY

04:24:23.747 --> 04:24:25.282
LEVEL SO HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE

04:24:25.349 --> 04:24:26.550
HIGHER COST OF LIVING. WE'RE NOT

04:24:26.617 --> 04:24:28.018
TALKING TO PEOPLE MAKING NESTLE

04:24:28.085 --> 04:24:29.553
THAT MUCH MONEY WHEN THEY'RE

04:24:29.620 --> 04:24:31.622
4100% OF THAT DIAZ. YOU KNOW

04:24:31.689 --> 04:24:32.723
THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THIS OF THE

04:24:32.790 --> 04:24:34.692
ALTOGETHER SO WHO KNOWS ALL THE

04:24:34.758 --> 04:24:36.627
PEOPLE YOU PICKED UP ABOVE 4100%

04:24:36.694 --> 04:24:37.995
PART IN FACT WHEN WE PREVIOUSLY

04:24:38.062 --> 04:24:39.997
DID OUR STATE SUBSIDY WE DID.

04:24:40.064 --> 04:24:42.132
RECOGNIZE THAT AND WE PROVIDE

04:24:42.199 --> 04:24:43.367
SUBSIDIES FOR FOUR HUNDRED TO

04:24:43.434 --> 04:24:45.069
SIX HUNDRED. BECAUSE WE KNEW

04:24:45.135 --> 04:24:45.769
THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE OUT

04:24:45.836 --> 04:24:48.005
THERE. WHO I MEAN I GOT REALLY

04:24:48.072 --> 04:24:49.607
EXPENSIVE THEY GOT NO SUB ZERO

04:24:49.673 --> 04:24:51.041
YOU YOU HIS AND HE HAD A CLASS

04:24:51.108 --> 04:24:52.142
RIGHT SO YOU KNOW YOU HAD SOME

04:24:52.209 --> 04:24:54.178
SUBSIDY AND THEN HIT 4100% FIVE.

04:24:54.245 --> 04:24:55.779
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL EASTENDERS

04:24:55.846 --> 04:24:57.047
BASICALLY GOT NOTHING SO WE SAID

04:24:57.114 --> 04:24:58.983
OKAY WE'RE GONNA PUT A STATE

04:24:59.049 --> 04:24:59.984
SUBSIDY. I KNOWS YOU KNOW I

04:25:00.050 --> 04:25:01.151
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE IDEA OF

04:25:01.218 --> 04:25:02.286
SAYING WHAT WE SHOULD FOCUS THE

04:25:02.353 --> 04:25:03.954
MONEY ON THE POOREST. BUT I

04:25:04.021 --> 04:25:05.789
THINK THAT WAS ALSO PART OF

04:25:05.856 --> 04:25:07.691
TRYING TO CREATE A LARGER

04:25:07.758 --> 04:25:09.059
MARKET. PLACE AS WELL AS

04:25:09.126 --> 04:25:10.861
AVAILABILITY THAT ABSOLUTE

04:25:10.928 --> 04:25:12.630
DENTAL I THINK CONTRIBUTED TO

04:25:12.696 --> 04:25:13.998
THE BILLETE PARA CALIFORNIA TO

04:25:14.064 --> 04:25:15.299
ACTUALLY HAVE KEEP THE LOWER

04:25:15.366 --> 04:25:17.034
PREMIUMS WHICH BY THE WAY ALSO

04:25:17.101 --> 04:25:19.470
HELPS. OVERALL IN TERMS OF HOW

04:25:19.536 --> 04:25:20.604
MUCH WE HAVE TO PUT IN FOR

04:25:20.671 --> 04:25:22.039
SUBSIDIES IN WE CAN KEEP THE

04:25:22.106 --> 04:25:28.345
PREMIUM AMOUNTS- LOWER. IN YOUR

04:25:28.412 --> 04:25:29.513
NEGOTIATION CORRECT. ABSOLUTELY

04:25:29.580 --> 04:25:31.215
IN. MEANS IN SPEECH THERE-

04:25:31.282 --> 04:25:32.082
DEFINITELY THOSE ARE PEOPLE.

04:25:32.149 --> 04:25:33.517
SUBSIDIES ARE HIGH. FOR THOSE

04:25:33.584 --> 04:25:35.719
HIGHER INCOME GROUPS. AND IT'S

04:25:35.786 --> 04:25:37.121
ONE OF OUR LOWEST GROUPS BY

04:25:37.187 --> 04:25:39.657
NUMBER THE NINETEEN ROWLEY'S SO.

04:25:39.723 --> 04:25:41.592
AN BIGGER NUMBERS OF ENROLLEES

04:25:41.659 --> 04:25:42.826
AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME

04:25:42.893 --> 04:25:45.529
SCALE BUT AGAIN AND THEY WILL

04:25:45.596 --> 04:25:47.631
SEE SMALLER LOSSES AFFAIR. WELL-

04:25:47.698 --> 04:25:48.866
SO THAT'S PART OF THE TRADE ON

04:25:48.932 --> 04:25:50.034
SO THE CONDENSATES AT THE

04:25:50.100 --> 04:25:52.269
MARGINS RIGHT. WORK THINGS GET A

04:25:52.336 --> 04:25:54.438
MOST AFFECTED SO. WE'RE TALKING

04:25:54.505 --> 04:25:55.973
ABOUT WHO WILL GET AFFECTED THE

04:25:56.040 --> 04:26:00.711
MOST AT THE MARGINS WITH THE.

04:26:00.778 --> 04:26:01.679
ELIMINATION OF THE A. R. P. AND

04:26:01.745 --> 04:26:03.414
WHAT DO WE DO WITH STATE PREMIUM

04:26:03.480 --> 04:26:06.016
SUBSIDIES. ARE OTHER SUBSIDIES

04:26:06.083 --> 04:26:09.620
RIGHT TO TRY TO. POLICE PROTECT.

04:26:09.687 --> 04:26:11.789
TO MAINTAIN ENOUGH OF A MARGIN

04:26:11.855 --> 04:26:15.092
THAT WOULD NOT. IN ORDER TO

04:26:15.159 --> 04:26:16.393
MAINTAIN OUR PREMIUM AND THAT

04:26:16.460 --> 04:26:18.028
YOU KNOW- ADVANTAGE IN

04:26:18.095 --> 04:26:20.864
NEGOTIATION AS WELL RIGHT SO I

04:26:20.931 --> 04:26:22.900
THINK THAT THE DYNAMIC WE

04:26:22.966 --> 04:26:24.301
DEFINITELY NEED TO BE LOOKING AT

04:26:24.368 --> 04:26:25.536
GREAT BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE

04:26:25.602 --> 04:26:27.171
PREMIUMS GO UP THAT DOESN'T JUST

04:26:27.237 --> 04:26:29.273
AFFECT. YOUR AFFECTS EVERYBODY

04:26:29.340 --> 04:26:31.975
CORRECT. BUT DOES THAT'LL TAX ON

04:26:32.042 --> 04:26:33.444
AND THE OFF EXCHANGE MARKET AS

04:26:33.510 --> 04:26:34.745
WELL AND WE'RE DEFINITELY

04:26:34.812 --> 04:26:36.380
LOOKING AT THAT NOW AS WE

04:26:36.447 --> 04:26:38.282
PREPARE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO

04:26:38.349 --> 04:26:39.717
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING BACK

04:26:39.783 --> 04:26:41.719
CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT ABOUT

04:26:41.785 --> 04:26:43.854
POTENTIAL IMPACTS AS A R. P.

04:26:43.921 --> 04:26:46.223
PREMIUM SUBSIDIES EXPIRING. SO I

04:26:46.290 --> 04:26:48.125
SAW SO I THINK INTO IN TERMS OF

04:26:48.192 --> 04:26:50.127
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT. YOU KNOW

04:26:50.194 --> 04:26:51.995
WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT'S

04:26:52.062 --> 04:26:54.965
WHATEVER WE PROPOSE A SUBSIDY

04:26:55.032 --> 04:26:57.034
SPECIALLY IF. WELL TEN FORTY

04:26:57.101 --> 04:26:58.135
RIGHT NOW IT'S WELL HOPEFULLY

04:26:58.202 --> 04:27:01.572
STILL S. BUT- WE DON'T HAVE ANY

04:27:01.638 --> 04:27:03.374
FOR YOU KNOW THE AARP GOES AWAY

04:27:03.440 --> 04:27:04.875
. WHAT WE DO THAT WOULD ALSO

04:27:04.942 --> 04:27:09.546
ENSURE THAT- WE- MAXIMIZE ACCESS

04:27:09.613 --> 04:27:12.316
WHICH ALSO INCLUDES. BETTER

04:27:12.383 --> 04:27:13.817
STABILIZATION THE MARKET WHICH

04:27:13.884 --> 04:27:15.252
INCLUDES GIVING COVERED

04:27:15.319 --> 04:27:18.422
CALIFORNIA THE BEST LEVERAGE FOR

04:27:18.489 --> 04:27:19.757
YOUR ACTIVE NEGOTIATION WHICH

04:27:19.823 --> 04:27:20.624
WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE SUMMER

04:27:20.691 --> 04:27:22.126
AFTER WE PASSED THE BUDGET RIGHT

04:27:22.192 --> 04:27:23.927
BECAUSE YOU GO TO THE HEALTH

04:27:23.994 --> 04:27:24.728
PLANS AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE
