SO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC STANDING. IN THE WORLD IS NO SECRET. OUR STATE CURRENTLY HAS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND WE'RE ON THE BRINK OF BECOMING THE FOURTH LARGEST. BUT IN RURAL CALIFORNIA WE NEED REASONABLE LEAVE THAT WERE NOT BE LEFT BEHIND. I AND THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. PERSISTENT POVERTY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AGING CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE. MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES OFTEN LACK ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES THE CAPITAL. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- THAT WOULD HELP MOVE OUR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIES FORWARD. AND BECOME CONSISTENTLY MORE PRODUCTIVE. IN RURAL CALIFORNIA OUR LOCAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIES CONSIST OF A MULTI. BILLION DOLLAR AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED OF THE COMMODITIES -- OVER A THIRD OF THE COUNTRY'S VEGETABLES AND TWO THIRDS OF THE COUNTRY'S FRUITS AND NUTS ARE GROWN RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY. OUR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC FORECAST IN THE STATE IS MIXED. AND IT DEPENDS HEAVILY ON REGION AND INDUSTRY. UNPREDICTABLE WILDFIRES DROUGHT INCREASES IN PRODUCTION EXPENSES TIGHTENING LABOR MARKETS ARE ALL FACTORS AFFECTING THE FUTURE OF OUR LOCAL AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIES. AB FOR SEVENTEEN AUTHORIZES AN APPOINTMENT WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. AN EXECUTIVE OFFICE -- A POSITION THAT IS DEDICATED TO STUDYING SUPPORTING AND IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S RURAL COMMUNITIES AND AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIES. AB FOR SEVENTY AUTHORIZES APPOINTEE TO PURSUE THE FOLLOWING FIRST TO WORK TO FOSTER -- THE COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES [inaudible] THE SECOND. TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FURTHER IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY SUCH AS INCREASING BROADBAND ACCESS. PROVIDING TECHNICAL RESOURCE AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND ADVANCING AG INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY. AND THIRD TO BUILD A FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE DATA DRIVEN POLICY MAKING BY COLLECTING INVESTIGATING AND REPORTING ON ECONOMIC DATA RELATED TO OUR AGRICULTURE. AND FINALLY AB FOR SEVENTEEN WOULD REQUIRE CDFA TO PREPARE A REPORT ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT SIGMA. A RECENTLY PUBLISHED -- PUBLIC POLICY IS TO TO REPORT THAT WAS TITLED WATER AND THE FUTURE OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. FOUND THAT AS MUCH AS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES COULD BE FOLLOWED AND FIVE POINT -- THREE THE BILLION DOLLARS LOST IN ANNUAL REVENUE DUE TO SIGNAL. I HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SIGMA'S ANTICIPATED DIRECT AND INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACTS ON AGRICULTURE ON OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES. REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE ECONOMIC IMPACTS IS CRITICAL -- SO MANAGER THANK YOU -- I DO HAVE -- SOME FOLKS HERE THAT. ARE SET TO DO ON THE PRESENTATION THANK YOU FIFTY FIRST WITNESSES SUPPORT PLEASE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS TO A RUSSIAN WITH A CALIFORNIA FARM HERE I'M NOT SURE I COULD HAVE SAID IT BETTER MYSELF. SO AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE MYSTERY OF US TO SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL -- AND WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF A LARGE COALITION OF BUSINESS AGRICULTURAL AND AND INDUSTRY LEADERS AT WHO ARE THINK. NOT TO DOUBLE BELABOR THE POINT BUT WE RECOGNIZE OUR REAL COMMUNITIES AND OUR ECONOMY'S FUNCTION LIKE AN ECOSYSTEM -- AGRICULTURE IS THE CATALYST THE DRIVER OF THOSE ECONOMICS AND THEN THEY SUPPORT THE SMALL BUSINESSES THE BOOKKEEPERS THAT BUSINESS MANAGERS. THE LABOR CONTRACTORS THE YEAR GATORS -- EVERYONE YOU COULD IMAGINE IN THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE REALLY DEPENDENT UPON THE PRODUCTIVITY OF ACT -- AND WHILE I THINK COLLECTIVELY WE THEN SUPPORT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICES TO THE RESIDENTS -- WELL THIS SORT OF INTO INTERDEPENDENCY MAKES US -- MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL IN OUR ACTIVITIES BENEFICIAL IT ALSO UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMICS AND THE POPULATION DENSITIES IN OUR REAL AREAS MAKES THIS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE -- WE HAVE JUST THREE OF US MENTIONED -- INABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL LACK OF TECHNICAL CAPACITY TO EVEN BEGIN TO BE COMPETITIVE. I'M IN THOSE FIELDS AND SOMETIMES THE PROGRAMS ARE GEARED TOWARDS THE AGRICULTURALLY BASED BUSINESSES THAT ARE WITHIN THESE REGIONS -- SO OUR INTENTION HERE WITH A BEFORE SEVENTEEN IS. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE US WITH WHAT WE NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND THAT'S THAT'S DATA. WE DO OUR OWN LEVEL OF DATA GENERATION BUT WE DON'T THINK ABOUT IT LOCALLY WE DON'T THINK ABOUT IT REGIONALLY IN TERMS OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. SO WE ARE ASKING FOR A POSITION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. I AM CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT THEIR EXISTING STAFF DO AS BEST AS THEY CAN WITH THE LIMITED RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO ENGAGE ON THESE TYPES OF ISSUES BUT WE'D LIKE TO SEE WITH A DEDICATED POSITION. A SORT OF CONCERTED EFFORT TO LOOK AT THOSE THINGS THAT WE KNOW ARE PIVOTAL -- FOR OUR RESILIENCY MEMBERS I HAVE A REAL COMMUNITIES I WERE ALSO ASKING A METHOD TO DEMONIZED THE POLICY BUT TO SAY WE NEED TO BE ADAPTIVE JUST LIKE WE STUDY CLIMATE CHANGE TO SEE HOW WE CAN ADAPT. WE WANT TO STUDY WITH THOSE IMPACTS WOULD BE ON INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACTS LIKE. LAND VALUES AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR PROPERTY TAX REVENUE -- CHANGING COMMODITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY INLAND EMPIRE AND ELSEWHERE -- WE THINK A BEFORE SEVENTEENTH HELPS US GET THERE AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. NEXT PERSON SUPPORT [inaudible] LEGISLATIVE. FOUR NICE TO SEE. OKAY ANYBODY ELSE WE CAN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY.

ACROSS THE STATE DEPEND ON THE FINANCIAL SOLVENCY OF BAG -- FROM BOOKKEEPERS FARMWORKERS QUINN THE MANUFACTURERS -- RETAILERS REAL REAL ESTATE AGENTS AND YOU YOU NAME IT. ALL OF THESE OTHER BUSINESSES DEPEND ON AG BEING THERE AND BEING A FINANCIALLY SOUND -- AS WE LOOK AT THINGS COMING UP LIKE THE SIGMA REGULATIONS AND HOW THESE THINGS ARE GONNA COME TO A FACT TALKING ABOUT POSSIBLY FOLLOWING OVER 30% OF OUR AG LANDS. IS REALLY VITAL THAT THIS MOVES FORWARD AND HIS POSITIONS CREATED -- YEAH I WANNA MAKE THIS CLEAR YOU KNOW THIS. TO ME THIS IS ON A ROLL BILL. THIS IS A BILL THAT'S ABOUT SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITIES.

AMOUNT FOR THERE'S A LOT OF DISTRICTS OUT THERE THAT HAVE GOOD PLANS THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING TO BE ABL TO IMPLEMENT SAID PLANS. AND SO I THINK THAT COULD PROVIDE A CUSHION OF THE AMOUNT OF LAND THAT POTENTIALLY HAS TO BE FOLLOWED BASED ON PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO PAY FOR THE PLANTS AND BUT PLANTATION. OKAY WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSER -- YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE A CLUE -- I DON'T -- HAVE A CLOSING YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE COMMENTS ARE WELL RECEIVED THIS IS -- YOU KNOW REALLY IMPORTANT BILL NOT ONLY FOR THE REPORTS TO SAY BUT FOR THE ENTIRE STATE ECONOMY AND SO -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIX THREE PLEASE CALLABLE.
