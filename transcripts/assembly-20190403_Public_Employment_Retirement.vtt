THEIR WAY OUT OF THE COMMITTEE

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:10.735

CAN BE VERY.

00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:13.938

SOMETHING I'VE BEEN TALKING

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.465
STAFF JUST RECENTLY ON THAT. FOR

00:31:40.531 --> 00:31:43.034
FUTURE ADOPTION -- BUT IN THIS

00:31:43.101 --> 00:31:44.302
CURRENT SET THE REGARD OPTION

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:52.110
THANK YOU.

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:53.778
A SUMMER COOLEY QUESTION.

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:55.713
WELL MORE JUST AN OBSERVATION BY

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:56.614
WAY OF FOLLOW UP ON THAT.

00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:57.849
I'M ACTUALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE

00:31:57.915 --> 00:32:00.018
PROVISION IN QUESTION.

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:01.986
YOUR IN BOTH THE INSURANCE CODE

00:32:02.053 --> 00:32:03.721
AND FOR THE HEALTH COMMITTEE.

00:32:03.788 --> 00:32:04.589
IF THERE'S A BILL THAT AFFECTS

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:06.491
THE COST OF HEALTHCARE.

00:32:06.557 --> 00:32:10.228
THERE IS PROVISION THOSE CABLES --

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:10.895
THERE IS PROVISION THOSE

00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:13.264
COMMITTEE RULES FOR STUDIES BUT

00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:14.365
THAT'S ACTUALLY FOUNDED UPON A

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:16.234
STATUTORY ACT BUT TROUBLES THE

00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:17.068
GOVERNMENT CODE PROVISION THAT

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:19.070
SETS UP THE PROCESS DESIGNATE AN

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:20.305
ENTITY THAT DOES THAT

00:32:20.371 --> 00:32:21.539
EXAMINATION.

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:23.374
SO AT THAT POINT WE'VE ALREADY

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:25.443
PASSED A LAW.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:26.644
THAT SETS UP SAY STRUCTURE.

00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:29.814
I I WILL SAY RATHER ON LIKE THE

00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:30.982
HEALTH FIELD WHICH IS SO

00:32:31.049 --> 00:32:31.816
GENERALIZED.

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:34.719
WE DO GET.

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:36.421
UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE

00:32:36.487 --> 00:32:37.021
STATE CONSTITUTION I DO THINK

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:39.557
ARE PENSION SYSTEMS ACTUALLY

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:41.159
ALEXANDER TELLS WITH THE MONEY

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:42.560
WOULD COME FROM BUT THEY CAN.

00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:44.295
OPINE AS THEY ALWAYS DO ON THE

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:45.296
FISCAL IMPACT OF THESE

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:46.631
DIVESTMENT THINGS.

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:48.433
BUT IF WE ADOPTED THAT SORT OF

00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:49.801
THING I THINK WE NEED TO SET UP

00:32:49.867 --> 00:32:51.769
A STATUTORY STRUCTURE.

00:32:51.836 --> 00:32:53.071
AND HAS BEEN HELD BEGAN AND THEN

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:54.339
THERE WOULD JUST BE CONFORMING A

00:32:54.405 --> 00:32:56.307
ROLE THAT STATUTE WHICH IS HOW

00:32:56.374 --> 00:32:59.210
THE INSURANCE ON HEALTH STUFF

00:32:59.277 --> 00:33:00.545
WORKS.

THANK YOU POINT ORTEGA'S OUGHT

QUESTIONABLE [inaudible]

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:07.285
THE SENATE HEARING ON WILL GO

00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:09.620

00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:16.553
SHE WOULD CALL US UP IN THE

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.187
MORNING TO TELL US THAT SHE WAS

WAY AND WALK TO SCHOOL.

00:44:21.825 --> 00:44:22.793
I COULD TELL YOU HOW MANY

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.894
BIRTHDAYS AND HOLIDAYS WERE

00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:26.130
SPENT WITHOUT HER BECAUSE OF THE

00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:28.132
PRACTICE OF MANDATORY OVERTIME.

00:44:28.198 --> 00:44:29.466
TO THIS DAY THIS PRACTICE

00:44:29.533 --> 00:44:30.834
CONTINUES.

00:44:30.901 --> 00:44:32.336
AND THE CHILDREN OF SOME OF THE

00:44:32.403 --> 00:44:34.671
MOST DEDICATED PUBLIC EMPLOYEES.

00:44:34.738 --> 00:44:36.073
ARE MISSING OUT IN GROWING UP

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.808
WITH THEIR FAMILIES PRESENT FOR

00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:39.610
SOME MAJOR EVENTS OF THEIR LIVES.

00:44:39.676 --> 00:44:41.578
IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH.

00:44:41.645 --> 00:44:43.347
THE STATE IN SIMPLE TERMS.

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:44.915
FORCED MANDATORY OVERTIME IS NOT

00:44:44.982 --> 00:44:46.884
SAFE.

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.053
STAFF ARE EXPECTED TO BE ALERT

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:50.821
AT ALL TIMES.

00:44:50.888 --> 00:44:52.256
WHEN THE SLIGHTEST LAPS AND

00:44:52.322 --> 00:44:54.224
OBSERVATION COULD LEAD TO TRAGIC

00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:56.193
CONSEQUENCES?

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.829
MANDATORY OVERTIME FLATLY MEANS

00:44:58.896 --> 00:45:00.731
UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS.

STAFF GET EXHAUSTED AND GET

00:45:05.035 --> 00:45:06.603
BURNED OUT.

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:07.771
THIS LEAVES THE STAFF BEING LESS

00:45:07.838 --> 00:45:09.139
ALERT.

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:10.441
THIS ALSO MEANS A HIGHER

00:45:10.507 --> 00:45:12.409
LIKELIHOOD OF STAFF INJURIES.

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.011
WHICH CAN ALSO AGAIN LEAD TO

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:16.046
STAFF BECOMING SO EXHAUSTED.

00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:17.614
THAT MANY OF THEM CALL IN JUST

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:19.249

00:45:19.316 --> 00:45:21.218

IT IN GOVERNOR SOME FOR PROPOSED

00:47:08.692 --> 00:47:11.228

00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:14.131
THE BUDGET INCLUDED OVER A THREE

00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:16.867
YEAR PERIOD IN IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:47:16.934 --> 00:47:18.502
THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:20.037
NEWS PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN

00:47:20.103 --> 00:47:21.438
POSITIONS.

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:22.406
THEN THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL

00:47:22.472 --> 00:47:25.442
IMMEDIATE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:26.843
FOUR PERMANENT INTERMITTENT

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:30.280
POSITIONS USED TO BE -- USED FOR

00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:33.617
JUST PURELY OVERTIME PURPOSES SO

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:35.919
YOU HAVE A TOTAL OF ROUGHLY FIVE

00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:36.653
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY OVER THE

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.121
COURSE OF THREE YEARS NEW

PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN POSITIONS.

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:41.959
THAT WILL VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE

00:47:42.025 --> 00:47:44.795
ALL OF THE MANDATORY OVERTIME.

00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:46.630
ONE THING I DIDN'T POINT OUT WAS

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:48.932
THIS PRACTICE OF MANDATORY

00:47:48.999 --> 00:47:50.567
OVERTIME IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:54.671
HAS BEEN BANNED SINCE.

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:55.305
TWO THOUSAND ONE AND SO I THINK

00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:57.941
IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT -- WE HAVE A

00:47:58.008 --> 00:48:00.043
LITTLE BIT OF EQUITY -- IN THE

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.045
STATE PRACTICES AS WELL

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:02.346
[inaudible]

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:05.816
THANK YOU.

00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:07.951
BY SURE GOING [inaudible]

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:11.688
QUESTION.

00:48:11.755 --> 00:48:13.857
HOW COME YOU HAVEN'T?

00:48:13.924 --> 00:48:15.325
ACHIEVE THIS AND COLLECTIVE

00:48:15.392 --> 00:48:16.660
BARGAINING.

00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:18.795
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I'M

00:48:18.862 --> 00:48:19.429
TIRED.

00:48:19.496 --> 00:48:23.133
SO THIS BILL AS THE ANALYSIS

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.270
POINTS OUT -- WE HAVE PROVISIONS

00:48:26.336 --> 00:48:28.839
IN OUR CONTRACT THAT STATES HOW

00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:31.174
MANY TIMES WE CAN BE MANDATED A

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:31.708
MONTH.

00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:34.077
SO THE LAST TIME WE RAN THIS

00:48:34.144 --> 00:48:37.648
BILL -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHAT'S

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:39.149
HAPPENED TO BE A CONTRACT YEAR --

00:48:39.216 --> 00:48:40.884
WE WERE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE DOWN

00:48:40.951 --> 00:48:43.587
FROM SIX TIMES A MONTH.

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:47.190
DOWN TO FIVE TIMES A MONTH.

00:48:47.257 --> 00:48:49.026
AGAIN FIVE TIMES A MONTH IS A

00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:51.595
BIT TOO MUCH I THINK WHEN THE

00:48:51.662 --> 00:48:52.796
PRACTICE IN.

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:56.233
AN OF ITSELF IS.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.201
JUST A POOR PRACTICE IT

00:48:58.268 --> 00:48:58.502
[inaudible]

00:48:58.568 --> 00:49:01.905
I WE'VE TRIED TO GET MORE

00:49:01.972 --> 00:49:04.041
LEVERAGE IN MORE TRACTION IN

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:06.009
NEGOTIATING IT IN OUR CONTRACT

00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:08.378
BUT EACH TIME WE'VE TRIED.

00:49:08.445 --> 00:49:11.581
WE'VE.

00:49:11.648 --> 00:49:13.684
MOVEMENT VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:15.252
AND COMPLETE RESISTANCE FROM THE

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:16.987
ADMINISTRATION THEN WHEN WE

00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:18.989
TRIED TO RUN A BILL THE BILL GOT

00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:20.123
VETO.

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.625
SO WE'RE UP AGAINST THE WALL NOW

00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:23.593
WE HAVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION WE

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.428
HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT'S

00:49:24.494 --> 00:49:26.930
WILLING TO INVEST INTO OUR STATE

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:29.599
HOSPITAL SYSTEM. TO TRYING TO

00:49:29.666 --> 00:49:32.035
REMOVE -- THE AMOUNTS OF

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:33.704
MANDATORY OVERTIME AND OVER TIME

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:35.339
IN GENERAL.

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:37.908
WE REALLY THINK THAT THIS IS THE

00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:40.110
RIGHT PATH BECAUSE IN PREVIOUS

00:49:40.177 --> 00:49:41.712
ADMINISTRATIONS WE HAVE NOT SEEN

00:49:41.778 --> 00:49:43.280
ANY MOVEMENT AND THIS IS AN

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:45.082
ISSUE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR

00:49:45.148 --> 00:49:46.416
DECADES.

00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:48.018
OKAY I'M.

00:49:48.085 --> 00:49:48.585
I CERTAINLY SEE THE NEED FOR

00:49:48.652 --> 00:49:49.419

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:51.755
BUT I HAVE TROUBLE CIRCUMVENT IN

00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:53.390

00:49:53.457 --> 00:49:54.658

SECOND MOTION SECOND WAS COULD I

00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:46.109
THINK SOMEONE WANTED TO ADD

00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:48.078
SOMETHING ON HIM TO A GOING AT

00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:49.112
ONE QUICK ONE COMMENT.

HAVING TO DRIVE HOURS JUST TO

00:51:01.825 --> 00:51:03.160
THEIR PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT.

00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:04.127
SO WHEN YOU MANDATE SOMEBODY TO

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:07.697
WORK THEY WORK SIXTEEN HOURS.

00:51:07.764 --> 00:51:09.232

ACROSS ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:20.436

NOW MORE THAN EVER CALIFORNIA

00:57:30.747 --> 00:57:31.247

00:57:31.314 --> 00:57:32.282
STEPS TO ENSURE THAT OUR WORKERS

SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL

00:57:43.893 --> 00:57:45.595
UNION -- AS MR BONTA SAID THIS

00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:47.497
IS A SIMPLE MEASURE BUILDING OFF

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:49.933
OF EXISTING LAW -- WHAT'S

00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:51.768
IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS IT EXISTING

00:57:51.835 --> 00:57:54.337
LAW FORTY EMPLOYER. TO USE AS

00:57:54.404 --> 00:57:56.439
MUCH TIME AND RESOURCES FOR

00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:57.173
THEIR EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.808
RELATIONS THEY CAN ASSIGN AS

00:57:58.875 --> 00:58:01.010
MANY STAFF FOR UNLIMITED AMOUNTS

00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:02.512
OF TIME TO MAKE SURE THE

00:58:02.579 --> 00:58:03.780
POSITION IS REPRESENTED.

00:58:03.847 --> 00:58:05.481
THEY CAN HIRE AS MANY OUTSIDE

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:06.816
LAW FIRMS AND CONSULTANTS AS

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:08.384
THEY WANT BUT CONVERSELY THE

00:58:08.451 --> 00:58:09.853
TIME FOR EMPLOYEES TO

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:11.487
PARTICIPATE.

00:58:11.554 --> 00:58:13.456
WITH PAY IS VERY VERY LIMITED --

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:15.391
CALIFORNIA HAS A COLLECTIVE

00:58:15.458 --> 00:58:17.193
BARGAINING STATUTES AND EACH OF

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:18.461
THOSE PROVIDE DIFFERENT LEVELS

00:58:18.528 --> 00:58:20.063
OF RELEASE TIME SOME SAY COULD

00:58:20.129 --> 00:58:20.763
PARTICIPATE IN THE FORMAL

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:22.065
BARGAINING PROCESS.

00:58:22.131 --> 00:58:24.000
ONCE SAID YOU CAN GO BEFORE PER

00:58:24.067 --> 00:58:25.401
IN A CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION

00:58:25.468 --> 00:58:27.036
ANOTHER SAYS YOU CAN PARTICIPATE

00:58:27.103 --> 00:58:28.705
THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS BUT IT'S

00:58:28.771 --> 00:58:34.277
NOT EQUAL AND IT'S VERY LIMITED --

00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:35.211
SO FOR EMPLOYEES TO PARTICIPATE

00:58:35.278 --> 00:58:36.646
IN THE BARGAINING PROCESS THEY

00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:38.948
NEED TO HAVE TIME OFF WITH PAY

00:58:39.015 --> 00:58:40.183
SO THAT THEY CAN.

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:42.018
HAVE THEIR POSITION REPRESENTED --

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:43.519
THE EMPLOYER'S GONNA THE IMPORT

00:58:43.586 --> 00:58:44.654
OPPOSITION IS GOING TO COME UP

00:58:44.721 --> 00:58:46.155
AND SAY THAT THIS BILL A RHODES

00:58:46.222 --> 00:58:47.390
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:48.825
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

00:58:48.892 --> 00:58:50.360
IS THAT RELEASE TIME IS A

00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:52.328
PRODUCT OF THE STATUTE IT IS NOT

00:58:52.395 --> 00:58:52.996
A PRODUCT OF COLLECTIVE

00:58:53.062 --> 00:58:54.631
BARGAINING WHAT IS COLLECTIVELY

00:58:54.697 --> 00:58:55.732
BARGAINED.

00:58:55.798 --> 00:58:57.734
IS WHAT DOES A REASONABLE AMOUNT

00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.769
OF TIME OFF IN A REASONABLE

00:58:59.836 --> 00:59:01.571
AMOUNT OF TIME AND REASONABLE

00:59:01.638 --> 00:59:03.072
AMOUNT OF EMPLOYEES ME.

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:04.440
SO THE STATUTE HAS ALWAYS

00:59:04.507 --> 00:59:06.676
DICTATED WHAT TYPES OF ACTIVITY

00:59:06.743 --> 00:59:08.311
CAN BE GIVEN FOR RELEASE TIME.

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:10.179
AND THAT IT'S FOR REASONABLE

00:59:10.246 --> 00:59:11.481
AMOUNT OF TIME SO THIS BILL IN

00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:12.949
NO WAY UNDERMINES THE COLLECTIVE

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:15.084
BARGAINING.

00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:16.085
PROCESS AT ALL.

00:59:16.152 --> 00:59:16.753
IT IS IMPORTANT TO ALSO

00:59:16.819 --> 00:59:18.321
RECOGNIZE THAT SOME EMPLOYERS

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:19.255
HAVE.

00:59:19.322 --> 00:59:20.456
GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND THE

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:22.825
STATUTE WHICH WE APPRECIATE AND

00:59:22.892 --> 00:59:23.426
HOW IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:25.528
AGREEMENTS -- AGREE TO

00:59:25.595 --> 00:59:26.429
ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS TO RELEASE

00:59:26.496 --> 00:59:28.064
TIME BUT FOR THE EMPLOYEES TO

00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:29.265
GET THAT THEY HAVE TO GIVE

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:30.466
SOMETHING ELSE UP OF THE

00:59:30.533 --> 00:59:32.235
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TABLE.

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:32.869
AND WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S

00:59:32.936 --> 00:59:34.504
VERY FAIR AGAIN THIS BILL DOES

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:35.538
NOT NECESSARILY PUT THE

00:59:35.605 --> 00:59:37.040
EMPLOYEES ON PAR WITH THE

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:55.297
ANY EMPLOYEE FOR JOINING OR NOT

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:55.697
JOINING A UNION.

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:57.466
SOME OF THESE LAWS THAT SAY THIS

01:13:57.533 --> 01:14:01.403
GO BACK. FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS --

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:02.971
THESE LAWS HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:04.907
BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES LIKE

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:07.142
PERP THE SUPREME COURT THE WELL

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:11.079
ESTABLISHED WHEN WE ADD --

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:13.182
ADDITIONAL STATUTES WITH

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:15.184
DIFFERENT LANGUAGE IT CHANGES

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:16.585
THE MEANING A WELL ESTABLISHED

01:14:16.652 --> 01:14:18.153
LAW AND INTERPRETATIONS BY THE

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.454
SUPREME COURT.

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:20.055
SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.456
THIS BILL REALLY PROVIDES

01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:22.324
NOTHING.

01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:25.561
BUT CONFUSION TO EXISTING LAW --

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:26.895
EMPLOYEES WHEN THEY GET HIRED

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:28.564
THEY'RE NOT AUTOMATICALLY UNION

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:29.998
MEMBERS THEY HAVE TO TAKE AN

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:31.567
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TO BECOME A

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:35.537
UNION MEMBER SO AN EMPLOYER --

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:37.272
WHEN THEY'RE HIRING PEOPLE DON'T

01:14:37.339 --> 01:14:39.141
DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:40.142
WHETHER SOME OF THE UNION MEMBER

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:41.643
NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T BECOME A

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:43.045
UNION MEMBER UNTIL AFTER THEY

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:43.879
GET HIRED?

01:14:43.946 --> 01:14:46.615
UNTIL AFTER THEY ACTUALLY SIGN A

01:14:46.682 --> 01:14:47.583
CARD SAYING I WANT TO BE A UNION

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:49.384
MEMBER SO WE REALLY THINK THIS

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:52.554
BILL IS -- NOT ENHANCING OF

01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:54.022
EXISTING LAW BUT INSTEAD

01:14:54.089 --> 01:14:55.357
CONFUSING OF EXISTING LAW THANK

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:06.869
PIECE OF LEGISLATION. FOR MANY

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:08.070

AND A. B. THREE SIXTY FIVE WOULD

TAKE SEVERAL IMPORTANT STEPS

01:27:20.168 --> 01:27:22.337
FORWARD IN THAT PROCESS.

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:24.539
FIRST OF ALL IT WOULD ASK CALLIE

01:27:24.606 --> 01:27:27.475
CHAR TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE

CAL H. R..

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:39.854
ADMINISTERS SO THAT MEANS THAT

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:41.255
INDIVIDUALS GOING THROUGH THE

01:27:41.322 --> 01:27:42.790

THROUGH THE LEE PROGRAM.

01:27:55.803 --> 01:27:57.438
AND SO THE BILL WOULD ASK CAL HR.

01:27:57.505 --> 01:27:58.606
TO MOVE FORWARD ON EXPANDING THE

01:27:58.673 --> 01:27:59.741

01:28:00.975 --> 01:28:02.710
SECONDLY OUR CALLIE CHAR WOULD

01:40:58.318 --> 01:40:59.520
AN ASSET OF VALUE YOU ARE

01:40:59.586 --> 01:41:02.523
SELLING IT -- TO TO A NON -- WHO

MASTER -- AND THAT THAT IT WAS

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:11.765
NO CHANGE IN CONTRAST WHEN WHEN --

01:41:11.832 --> 01:41:13.167
CALPERS SHOWING DATING GAUGE

01:41:13.233 --> 01:41:15.335
WITH WITH STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE

01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:16.937
HAVE SEEN CHANGE FOR EXAMPLE.

01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:19.106
THERE WERE -- MEASURES LAST YEAR

01:41:19.173 --> 01:41:20.941
THAT WOULD MANDATED THE FIND I.

01:41:21.008 --> 01:41:22.943
BASS FROM -- RETAILERS WHO SELL

01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:24.845
HIGH POWERED FIREARMS -- THE

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:27.047
BILL FORTUNATELY DID NOT MOVE I

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:28.515
CALPERS DIE IN GAUGE WITH THOSE

01:41:28.582 --> 01:41:30.184
RETAILERS AND WE'VE SEEN AT

01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:31.151
RECENTLY THAT DICK'S SPORTING

01:41:31.218 --> 01:41:32.920

01:41:32.986 --> 01:41:34.154
SELL HIGH POWERED FIREARMS IT'S

01:41:34.221 --> 01:41:35.656
WORKING WHEN WE ENGAGE USING OUR

01:41:35.722 --> 01:41:40.294
PROXY VOTING -- WORK WORKING

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:43.230
WITH THESE COMPANIES -- BECAUSE

01:41:43.297 --> 01:41:44.364
WE KNOW THAT THAT'S AND DOESN'T

01:41:44.431 --> 01:41:44.965
WORK ENGAGEMENT DOES WORK WE

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:46.033
COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT

01:41:46.099 --> 01:41:47.434
THERE REALLY IS NO MORAL VICTORY

01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:49.770
WITH RETIREMENT SECURITY -- THE

01:41:49.837 --> 01:41:53.507
THE CHALLENGE WITH THE THE

01:41:53.574 --> 01:41:54.408
ONSLAUGHT OF THE DIVESTMENT

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:55.909
BILLS IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO

01:41:55.976 --> 01:41:57.478
TAKE AWAY THE TOOLS THAT THE

01:41:57.544 --> 01:41:59.112
INVESTMENT TEAM NEEDS.

01:41:59.179 --> 01:42:00.247
BY.

01:42:00.314 --> 01:42:01.582
ABOUT THE SAME TIME KICKING THEM

01:42:01.648 --> 01:42:02.249
FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET THEIR

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:04.251
BEST RETURNS AND WHILE THERE IS

01:42:04.318 --> 01:42:05.252
LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT SAYS THEY

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:06.753
HAVE TO CITE THE PURDUE SHARE

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:07.654
RESPONSIBILITY.

01:42:07.721 --> 01:42:10.491
FISHER RESPONSIBILITIES VERY --

01:42:10.557 --> 01:42:12.326
AT UP FOR INTERPRETATION THE

01:42:12.392 --> 01:42:15.462
CALPERS BOARD -- USED THEIR

01:42:15.529 --> 01:42:16.463
PRODUCE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:18.365
DIVEST FROM THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY --

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:19.600
THAT'S ALL FINE AND GOOD EXCEPT

01:42:19.666 --> 01:42:21.034
FOR ITS COST THE FUND ABOUT TEN

01:42:21.101 --> 01:42:21.768
TO TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:42:21.835 --> 01:42:22.936
POTENTIAL LOSSES.

01:42:23.003 --> 01:42:24.838
THE JUSTIFICATION FOR SUCH WAS

01:42:24.905 --> 01:42:25.873
BECAUSE THERE WAS LAWSUIT THAT

01:42:25.939 --> 01:42:26.573
WERE PENDING AGAINST TOBACCO

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:27.708
COMPANIES THERE FOR THE SHARES

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:28.942
COULD BE GOING DOWN.

01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:29.776
USING THEIR PRODUCER

01:42:29.843 --> 01:42:31.078
RESPONSIBILITY THERE INDEMNIFIED

01:42:31.144 --> 01:42:32.312
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

01:42:32.379 --> 01:42:34.047
INDEMNIFIED ARE THE ACTIVE

01:42:34.114 --> 01:42:35.782
EMPLOYEES RETIREES IN THE

01:42:35.849 --> 01:42:37.618
AGENCIES THAT ARE THE INSURERS

01:42:37.684 --> 01:42:39.520
OF ANY LOSS THAT THE DIVESTMENT

01:42:39.586 --> 01:42:40.554
DOES CREATE.

01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:43.390
THE THE FIND IS THAT 65% FUNDED

01:42:43.457 --> 01:42:45.025
THAT IS SIXTY FIVE CENTS FOR

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:46.527
EVERY DOLLAR THAT AS TO AN

01:42:46.593 --> 01:42:48.195
ACTIVE OR RETIRED EMPLOYEE.

01:42:48.262 --> 01:42:50.831
THE FIGHT DE THE PERSPECTIVE

01:42:50.898 --> 01:42:52.199
RETURNS FOR THIS YEAR BOB WILL

01:42:52.266 --> 01:42:54.301
LIKELY NOT HIT THE 7% MARK.

01:42:54.368 --> 01:42:55.636
THAT IS ANOTHER THAT IS YET

01:42:55.702 --> 01:42:57.137
GOING TO BE YET ANOTHER --

01:42:57.204 --> 01:42:59.473
STOPGAP WERE EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:01.341
AND RETIREES HAVE TO MAKE UP

01:43:01.408 --> 01:43:03.176
THAT DIFFERENCE -- THE NUMBERS

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:04.811
WE'VE SEEN HOVER AROUND FIVE

01:43:04.878 --> 01:43:05.579
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:43:05.646 --> 01:43:07.481
DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT --

01:43:07.548 --> 01:43:08.949
THAT.

01:43:09.016 --> 01:43:10.150
THE CALPERS STAFF AND CAL STAR

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:11.418

SEEK OUT INDIVIDUALS SPECIALIZE

01:43:13.854 --> 01:43:15.255
INDEX FUNDS GO THROUGH AND MAKE

01:43:15.322 --> 01:43:16.557
SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE INDEX

01:43:16.623 --> 01:43:17.291
FUNDED THERE THAT THEY'RE

01:43:17.357 --> 01:43:18.725
INVESTING AND DOES NOT HAVE ITS

01:43:18.792 --> 01:43:19.293

MOTIVATION FOR THIS -- BUT

01:43:29.236 --> 01:43:30.637
DIVESTMENT AS A PRINCIPAL WE ARE

01:43:30.704 --> 01:43:31.638
STRONGLY OPPOSED WE SIMPLY

01:43:31.705 --> 01:43:33.607
CANNOT SUPPORT A MEASURE THAT

01:43:33.674 --> 01:43:34.975
PUTS AT RISK THE MILLIONS OF

01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:36.209
