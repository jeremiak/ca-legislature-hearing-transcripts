THIS IS THE JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HEARING. WE FIVE ITEMS ON THE AGENDA. IT'S MISTER PAN HERE MISTER PANTS HERE WILL TAKE THESE IN. IT IS SIGNED AN ORDER DIFFERENT IN THE INNER JACKSON CENTER JACKSON'S FIRST SENATE JACKSON SIGNED IN FIRST WELCOME SENATOR. LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM REAL QUICKLY HERE IF WE COULD CALL ROLE TRACY [inaudible] DALY [inaudible] HERE [inaudible] MAYES [inaudible] HERE [inaudible] BIGELOW [inaudible] CABALLERO [inaudible] CALDERON [inaudible] CHECK [inaudible] TO COOLEY COOPER [inaudible] HERE [inaudible] FRAZIER UNDER [inaudible] GIPSON [inaudible] GRAYSON [inaudible] HARPER. YOU DID GREAT. ALRIGHT WE HAVE A QUORUM. AND PLEASE PROCEED SENATOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND GOOD MORNING MEMBERS. I AM VERY PLEASED TO PRESENT TO S. B. NINE SEVENTEEN A BILL THAT CLARIFIES. EXISTING CALIFORNIA INSURANCE LAW BY REAFFIRMING. THAT AN INSURANCE POLICY SHELL COVER LOSS OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM A MUD FLOW. OR SIMILAR EVENT IF THE MUD FLOW WAS ITSELF. BECAUSE BY ANOTHER COVERED PERIL. SUCH AS FIRE. IN THE OF EARLY HOURS OF JANUARY NINTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN A ONYX THE INEXPLICABLE ABSOLUTELY. A DEVASTATING A MUD FLOW RIPPED THROUGH. THE COASTAL COMMUNITY OF MAMA SETO NEAR SANTA BARBARA IN MY DISTRICT INFECTED A MILE FROM WHERE I LIVE AND HAVE FOR MANY YEARS. KILLING TWENTY THREE RESIDENTS. INCLUDING A TWO YEAR OLD AND A NUMBER OF CHILDREN. AS WELL AS PEOPLE I KNEW. AND SIGNIFICANTLY DAMAGED AND DESTROYED ALMOST 10% OF THEIR COMMUNITIES HOMES INCLUDING THE HOMES OF SEVERAL OF MY VERY DEAR PERSONAL FRIENDS. THE MUD FLOW RESULTED WHEN SIGNIFICANT RANGE. AT TIMES REACHING THE RATE OF HALF AN INCH IN FIVE MINUTES. FELL UPON THE BAR BURN SCAR LEFT BY THE THOMAS FIRE. THE LARGEST WHILE IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. THOUGH THIS FIRE STARTED TO APPROXIMATELY [inaudible] A DECEMBER FOURTH. AND THIS MONTH SLIDE WAS JANUARY NINTH. THE FIRE TOOK FORTY DAYS. BEFORE IT WAS PUSHED INTO THE BACK COUNTRY. SO FOR FORTY DAYS THIS COMMUNITY. WAS OUT ON PINS AND NEEDLES AND IN FACT. MANY THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN MONTECITO. HAD BEEN EVACUATED NO LESS THAN FIVE OR SIX TIMES. IN THAT INTERVENING FORTY DAYS. I PERSONALLY WAS EVACUATED FOR A WEEK. SO WHEN THIS OF FIRE CONCLUDED. A AT THE END OF DECEMBER IT'D LEFT ABOUT. FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY SQUARE MILES OF RUGGED TERRAIN BEHIND MINE ACETO. WITHOUT VEGETATION AND SEARED THE BARREN EARTH WAS SUCH HEAT. THAT AN IMPERVIOUS CRUST FORMED ON THE SURFACE SO WHEN THE RAINS CAME THIS ESSENTIALLY WATER REPELLENT LAYER. IMPEDED THE ABILITY OF THE SOIL TO ABSORB ANY SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE RESULTING IN A DEBRIS FLOW AND THAT IS NOT OF MUCH SLIDE A DEBRIS FLOW IS BOULDERS WEIGHING THOUSANDS OF POUNDS. TREES UPROOTED SHRUBS UPROOTED THAT CAME DOWN AT A RATE OF ABOUT THIRTY MILES AN HOUR THROUGH THIS COMMUNITY. TO THE OCEAN. AND A CLOSE TO THE HIGHWAY FOR SEVERAL WEEKS. THE DEBRIS FLOW. BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CUBIC YARDS OF MUD. TO COME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS. AT A RATE AS I MENTIONED OF UP TO THIRTY MILES AN HOUR. THE AFTERMATH OF THIS DISASTER MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. ARE NOW FACED WITH THE PROSPECT OF REBUILDING AND RECOVERING THEIR LOSSES. AND MANY OF THESE PEOPLE. ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING FOLKS WHO HAPPEN TO LIVE IN AN AREA THAT WAS DECIMATED BY THE FIRE. AND MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED INDIVIDUALS CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY LAWYERS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS. AND A OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A GREAT LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT. INSURANCE ABOUT THE LAW ABOUT PROCESS. AND YET A PUBLIC DEBATE HAS EMERGED ABOUT WHETHER HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICIES WILL COVER MUCH FLOW CAUSE DAMAGE OR WHETHER COVERAGE FOR THIS PERIL REQUIRE SPECIALIZED FLOOD INSURANCE. MUCH OF THIS DEBATE CENTERS ON WHETHER FIRE CAUSE MUD FLOWS ARE CONSIDERED TO RESOLVE FROM A COVERED PERIL. SUCH AS A FIRE UNDER HOMEOWNERS POLICY OR WHETHER DAMAGE FROM MUD FLOWS FALLS WITHIN A POLICIES EXCLUSION FOR EARTH MOVEMENT AND WATER DAMAGE. WE NOW REMEMBERING THAT THIS MUCH FLOW OCCURRED TWO WEEKS AFTER THE FIRE THERE'S VERY LITTLE ARGUMENT THAT THE FIRE. AND THE DECIMATION OF ALL OF THE SURROUNDING AREAS AND I AS I MENTIONED THIS CROSS THAT DEVELOP OVER VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE AREA UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS. WAS THE WHAT THEY CALL THE EFFICIENT PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THIS [inaudible] MUCH LOVE. BUT WITHIN DAYS OF THE EVENT TWO OPPOSING OP ED SAPIR IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES DRAWING OPPOSITE CONCLUSIONS AS TO WHETHER A HOMEOWNERS POLICY. WOULD COVER DAMAGE FROM THE MUD FLOWS LATER THAT MONTH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE SOUGHT TO CLARIFY THE ISSUE OF COVERAGE THROUGH A NOTICE ISSUED TO PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURERS. REMINDING THEM. OF THEIR RISK COVERAGE FOR UNCOVERED UNCOVERED PERILS UNDER CALIFORNIA'S EFFICIENT PROXIMATE CAUSE DOCTRINE BUT EVEN WITH THIS CLARIFICATION. I HAVE HEARD NUMEROUS ACCOUNTS FROM CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT. WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN CONFLICTING ADVICE AND AS A RESULT MAY BE STUCK IN UNNECESSARY DISPUTES WITH THEIR INSURERS? NOW MANY OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE HOMES THAT ARE STILL UNDER FOUR FEET OF MUD. FOUR FEET OF MUD THAT IS ABOUT TO THE TOP OF THE DYESS. THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE. IT'S HIGHER THAN THAT. ALL RIGHT TO THE TOP OF THE MICROPHONES ID IT'S AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM IN THE LONGER THIS MUCH DAYS THE MORE IT CREATES THE POTENTIAL FOR MOLD. AND THE FURTHER DECIMATION OF THEIR PROPERTY [inaudible] SO -- SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE LAW HAS REQUIRED THE PROPERTY INSURER TO PROVIDE COVERAGE. WHENEVER AN INSURED PERIL IS INDEED THE EFFICIENT PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THE LOS. THE OFFICIAL MEANT PROXIMATE CAUSE IS THE CAUSE AMONG OTHER DIFFERENT CONCURRENT CAUSES TO WHICH A LOSSES MOST DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE EVEN THOUGH OTHER CAUSES MAY FOLLOW IT. AND OPERATE MORE IMMEDIATELY IN PRODUCING THE LOSS THAT DESPITE THIS LONG STANDING PRECEDENT INSURERS CONTINUE TO DISPUTE WHETHER HOMEOWNERS POLICIES PROVIDE COVERAGE WHEN LOSSES OCCURRED DUE TO MUD FLOWS THAT WERE THEMSELVES. BECAUSE BY OTHER COVERED PERIL SUCH AS WILDFIRE. IN THE CASE OF MONTECITO RESIDENTS THIS CONFUSION IN THE MARKETPLACE AGAIN LEAVES HOMEOWNERS WONDERING WHETHER THE LOSS OF FOR MANY THEIR LARGEST SINGLE ASSET THEIR HOME. WILL BE COVERED BY INSURANCE AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU FOR MANY OF THESE PEOPLE THEY HAVE BEEN LAND RICH AND CASH POOR. MANY OF THEM ARE SENIORS WHO HAVE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO LIVE OUT THE REST OF THEIR LIVES IN THEIR HOMES THAT THEY OWN FREE AND CLEAR BECAUSE THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE ELSE. TO RELY UPON. THIS BILL AIMS TO CODIFY CALIFORNIA'S A FISHMAN PROXIMATE CAUSE DOCTRINE IN IN THIS CONFUSION ONCE AND FOR ALL. AS AMENDED IN THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE THE BILL STATES THE QUOTE IF A LOSS OR DAMAGE RESULTS FROM A COMBINATION OF PERILS. ONE OF WHICH IS A LANDSLIDE. COVERAGE SHALL BE PROVIDED IF AN INSURED PERIL IS THE EFFICIENT PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THE LOSS OR DAMAGE. THIS FORMULATION OF DOCTRINE FOLLOWS THE RELEVANT PRECEDENT THAT EXISTS ALREADY IN CALIFORNIA LAW SUCH AS THE HOWL VERSUS STATE FOREIGN CASE AS WELL AS THAT USED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. IN ITS JANUARY NOTICE TO THE INDUSTRY CRITICALLY THE SOURCES EXPRESS THE DOCTRINE IN AFFIRMATIVE LANGUAGE THAT'S WAY IT APPEARS IN THE CASE LAW AND WE HAVE BASICALLY TRANSFERRED THAT. AFFIRMATIVE LANGUAGE INTO THIS LEGISLATION COVERAGE SHALL BE PROVIDED THAT'S THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL NOT IN THE DOUBLE NEGATIVES LIKE COVERAGE SHALL NOT BE DENIED. AS SOME STAKEHOLDERS WOULD PREFER. THERE'S NO CASE LAW THAT I'M AWARE OF IN NOTHING THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THAT ARE THAT APPROACHES THE SUBJECT IN THE NEGATIVE. AS THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SUGGESTS I WOULD INVITE THE VERY CONFUSION I'M TRYING TO AVOID SO THAT THESE PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE. APPROPRIATE COVERAGE IF THEY ARE INDEED COVERED FOR FIRE. THE MUD SLIDE BEING THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THEIR LOSSES AND THAT AGAIN IS SOMETHING THAT GETS TO BE DETERMINED BUT IT'S VERY HARD AND VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE TO A ARE TAKING THE POSITION. THAT IT WAS IN THE FAR THE BECAUSE THIS MONTH SO I WOULD NOT LOOKING THREE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD FIVE YEARS OF THE TWO WEEKS LATER. THIS EVENT HEARD NOW I HAVE. A BEEN WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS ASSISTANCE IN THIS TO ADDRESS THE SUPPOSED SHOULD CONCERN -- THAT. WELL THIS MIGHT ALLOW PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T PAID THEIR FIRE INSURANCE TO BE ABLE TO GET COVERAGE THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT'S NOT WHAT WE THINK THE LEGISLATION SAYS BUT WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE ASSN AMENDMENT CLARIFYING LANGUAGE -- THAT OF WILL AND I DON'T HAVE IT. I HEAR IT IS THE BASICALLY SAYS NOTHING IN THE ACT ADDING SECTION FIFTY OF FIVE THIRTY POINT FIVE TO THE INSURANCE CODE IS INTENDED TO TO ALTER. OR ABROGATE ANY DEFENSES EITHER IN CONTRACT OR LAW THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS BILL. SO IF YOU HADN'T PAGER FIRE INSURANCE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THIS COVERAGE BUT IF YOU ARE CURRENT IF YOU ARE UP TO DATE IF YOU WOULD BE ENTITLED TO COVERAGE -- BECAUSE OF A FIRE BECAUSE THIS IS THE OFFICIAL PROXIMATE CAUSE THESE MONTH SUCH YOU WILL BE COVERED THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THESE PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES MANY OF THEM FRANKLY CAN'T REBUILD BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY LAND LEFT. AND NOW THEY ARE IN MAJOR -- AREAS OF THAT MUCH YOU KNOW POTENTIAL FLOODING. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE COVERAGE THEY'RE ENTITLED TO GET COMPENSATION THEY'RE ENTITLED TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THEIR NEXT STEP AND GET ON WITH THEIR LIFE THEY'VE BEEN PAYING THEIR PREMIUMS. AND WITHOUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY -- TO TESTIFY AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THIS IS -- SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART THIS IS SOMETHING FOR WHICH INSURANCE IS INTENDED. AND THESE FOLKS. REALLY DESERVE TO BE A ABLE TO ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THEIR CONTRACTS MANY COMPANIES HAVE ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED THIS IT ISN'T ALL OF THEM. BUT SOME OF THEM HAVEN'T AND IT RATHER THAN HAVE THIS CONFUSION GOING FORWARD I WANT TO SPECIFICALLY POINT OUT STATE FARM HAS BEEN THE STATE THIS IS A CASE AGAINST STATE FORM. RECOGNIZING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY MANY COMPANIES HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD ACTORS THEY'VE BEEN THERE HELPING THESE PEOPLE BUT MANY HAVE NOT AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE. THAT THESE COMPANIES HELP THERE UP POLICY HOLDERS AND DO THE RIGHT THING BY THEM SO -- WITH ME TODAY ARE TWO WITNESSES TO A ADDRESS THE LEGALITY THIS AND ALSO TO TO SHARE WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE DISTRICT BECAUSE I'M. AWARE THAT THERE IS SOME CLAIM THAT EVERYTHING IS JUST REALLY HUNKY DORY. I WISH THAT WERE THE CASE BUT IT'S NOT. SENATOR JACKSON BEFORE YOUR WITNESSES A SPEAK I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALL -- ARE AWARE OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS SENATOR JACKSON IS ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT AND WE THEIR COPIES AT EACH [inaudible] ABOUT. PLACE HIROTA ON THE DYESS. IT'S THAT IT'S THAT IT'S EXACTLY THE LANGUAGE THAT SHE READ INTO THE RECORD AND I JUST WANNA ESTABLISHED THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ACCEPTING THAT AND THE POLICE TO PROCEED [inaudible] IT. YES -- I'M WE HARRIS AND I'M. PRESIDENT OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA AND ALMOST. SYRIA'S INSURANCE COVERAGE -- I REPRESENT HOMEOWNERS -- AND HAVE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS WHO -- HAVE ABOUT INSURANCE POLICIES -- THE ISSUE -- THAT -- THE SENATOR RAISED IS -- ABOUT EFFICIENT PROXIMATE -- BECAUSE PROXIMATE CAUSE -- IS IF YOU. TO MAKE IT INTO A NOTE SIMPLER MORE UNDERSTANDABLE WAY IF YOU THINK OF A ROW OF DOMINOES. AND EACH ONE OF THOSE DOMINOES IS A BECAUSE IN SOME STATES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE FLORIDA. IF ANY OF THOSE CAUSES THOSE DOMINOES IS COVERED UNDER THE POLICY THERE IS COVERAGE. IN CALIFORNIA OF WHAT OUR SUPREME COURT HAS SAID IN -- GARVEY -- VERSUS STATE FARMER WITH THE COURTS HAVE SAID IN THE HOW CASE. IS THAT YOU LOOK AT THE MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE EFFICIENT PROXIMATE CAUSE THAT IS THE ONE THAT SETS THE DOMINOES IN MOTION. AND THAT IS WHAT THE EFFICIENT PROXIMATE CAUSES WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT ENSHRINES IN STATUTE WHAT IS ALREADY THE LAW WITH THE WITH THE COURTS HAVE HELD FOR DECADES. IS THE LAW WHICH IS THE OFFICIAL PROXIMATE CAUSE THAT IS YOU LOOK AT THE MOST OF FISH MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHICH ARE IN IN THE SITUATION THAT THE SENATORS TALKED ABOUT. WAS A FIRE THAT STARTED THE DOMINOES IN MOTION AND SO -- I JUST WANTED PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITY TO EX TO EXPLAIN WHY HOW THE LAW WORK AND IF YOU -- IF -- YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM THANK YOU MISTER HARRIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YES THANK YOU I'M TERRY COLEMAN I'M ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE UNITED POLICY HOLDERS. IN NOT A POLICY HOLDERS IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT. IT'S FUNDAMENTAL -- AIM IS -- TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO DOES WITH RESPECT TO PROCURING INSURANCE -- IMPORTANT ASPECT OF WHAT WE DO. IS WHAT'S CALLED ROADMAP TO RECOVERY. IN CONNECTION WITH THAT WE HOLD WORKSHOPS -- IT THE PLACES OF OF DISASTERS. LATELY WE'VE BEEN STRETCHED THIN. UP AND DOWN THE STATE. HOLDING DOZENS AND DOZENS OF WORKSHOPS. MEETING WITH DISASTER VICTIMS IN BRINGING TOGETHER BOTH GOVERNMENTAL ASSISTANCE. AND EXPERTISE WITH RESPECT TO INSURANCE. AND AND THE LAW. I CAN TELL YOU. HAVING SAT ACROSS VICTIMS THAT. NO ONE UNDERSTANDS INSURANCE. THE MOST SOPHISTICATED THE MOST EDUCATED PEOPLE ARE JUST LIKE. THE AVERAGE CITIZEN WITHOUT SUCH TRAINING. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND INSURANCE. IN TRYING TO EXPLAIN EFFICIENT PROXIMATE CAUSE. THANK YOU OF MISTER HARRIS FOR THE DOMINO -- ANALOGY THAT'S HELPFUL. CLARITY IS IMPORTANT. WHEN I SIT ACROSS FROM SOMEBODY? AND I ASK THEM. HOW CAN I HELP? THERE TYPICAL RESPONSES. WHAT DO I DO? THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND STEP. ONE WHICH PRIMARILY IN THIS INSTANCE. IS JUST SUBMISSION OF A CLAIM. TRUE SUBMISSION OF A CLAIM. THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. DOES NOT DENY THE EFFICIENT PROXIMATE CAUSE RULE. THEY NEED TO RECEIVE THE CLAIM. FROM THE VICTIMS. AND THEIR FIRST. THE IS THE CONSUMERS FIRST EXPERIENCE IN THIS REGARD. IS MEDIA COVERAGE [inaudible] WHICH INVARIABLY. HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT LANDSLIDES AND MUDSLIDES AND DEBRIS FLOW ARE COMMONLY EXCLUDED [inaudible] THIS BILL. IS OF VERY IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION AND DISCLOSURE BILL. IT IS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE CLARITY TO THESE VICTIMS AND UP AND DOWN THIS STATE. WE IS AN ORGANIZATION IN TRYING TO BRING CLARITY HAVE HAD TO CONFRONT THIS. YEAH SO THE UNITED POLICY HOLDERS STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS LEGISLATION. AND WERE HOPEFUL FOR ITS PASSAGE THINK THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY -- FARTHER FOR FOLKS HERE WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. ARE THERE PERSONS HERE. WHO ARE -- WILL WISH TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. OR WHO MAY BE IN THE TWEENER CATEGORY. EITHER. EITHER CATEGORY [inaudible] WELCOME. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS CAN STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF ALL STATE INSURANCE THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION AND A NUMBER OF OTHER. INSURANCE TRADE ASSOCIATIONS AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHAT THE AUTHOR AND THE PROPONENTS SAID -- WE AGREE WITH. HER STATEMENT HER WITNESSES STATEMENT OF THE LAW. ARE COMPLETE IF IT'S ACCURATE A AND I'M NOT GONNA REPEAT WHAT EFFICIENT PROXIMATE CAUSE IS AND I'M BECAUSE I THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S NO NEED -- I ALSO BOTTOM ONE AT TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY HOW SYMPATHETIC WE ARE TOO AND THE VICTIMS AND AND SENATOR JACKSON'S CONSTITUENTS COME -- FOR THEIR SUFFERING. BUT NEITHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS MEANS THAT THERE'S A NEED -- I NEED FOR THIS BILL THE LAW IS ALREADY QUITE CLEAR -- AS BOB THE SENATOR ARTICULATED AS THE SENATOR'S FIRST WITNESS ARTICULATED. AYE AS STEVE JONES ARTICULATED IN HIS MEMO TO THE INDUSTRY COM. ABOUT IF THERE'S A FLOOD HERB THERE'S RAINS HAVE. THAT THE RAINS BECAUSE THAT LED TO SCOOT TO GO DOWN AND DAMAGE YOUR HOME THEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES MAY NOT EXCLUDE. FOR THAT WE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY DISPUTE FOR THAT ON AND IN FACT -- WE ASKED THE SENATOR AND THE SENATOR'S STAFF IF THERE WERE CONSTITUENTS WHOSE COMPANIES WERE NOT COVERING -- THAT -- AMONG THE DAMAGE AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD OF THERE ARE AND IF THERE ARE ANY PLEASE PLEASE LET US KNOW BECAUSE WE WILL WORK WITH OUR FOLKS HERE. BECAUSE ALL OF THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES WHOSE LOBBYIST GET AROUND TO MEET TOGETHER WERE LIKE ARE WE COVERING THAT'S IN IT AND EVERYBODY AGREES THAT JUST AS THE SENATOR ARTICULATED. BECAUSE THE RANGE HAPPEN SO SOON AFTER ON THE FIRES THAT THAT. WAS OF THE FIRES WERE IN FACT THE EFFICIENT NAM PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THAT -- WE THEREFORE BELIEVE ARM AS A PRINCIPLE BASIS THERE'S NOT A LARGE OF DOES NOT DISPUTE HERE AND THERE'S NO THERE'S NO NEED -- FOR THE BILL. NEVERTHELESS UNDERSTANDING -- THAT DESIRE -- TO ENSHRINED IN STATUTES SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY LAWYERS REPRESENTING MULTIPLE DIFFERENT COMPANIES HAVE A REALLY EXTENSIVE PROCESS OF PHONE CALLS AND EMAILS TRYING TO DISTILL INTO WORDS WHAT. UP THAT CASE LAW STOOD FOR AND ANNA. HAVE YOU ALL HAVE EVER HAD A BUNCH OF LAWYERS IN THAT ROOM GETTING THEM TO AGREE ON ANYTHING IS REALLY DIFFICULT AND GETTING A BUNCH OF INSURANCE LAWYERS -- TO AGREE ON WHAT THE CASE FOR WAS WAS NOT AN EASY TASK AND WE DID THAT AND WE PROVIDED THAT IN OUR OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED LETTER AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY RE OUR LANGUAGE AND YOUR LANGUAGE ARE GONNA. REGULAR NON WHERE PEOPLE ARE GONNA THINK THEY'RE THAT DIFFERENT. BUT INSURANCE COVERAGE LAWYERS WITH YEARS AND YEARS OF EXPERIENCE ON FELT THAT THEY WERE. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IS HE IN HOW THE LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN AND SO IN THE BILL YOU KNOW IT SAYS AYE BUT COVERAGE MUST BE PROVIDED AN IN ON OUR PROPOSED LANGUAGE IT SAYS WE MAY NOT EXCLUDE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE AND FOR EXAMPLE. JULIAN VERSUS HARTFORD UNDERWRITERS INSURANCE THE CASE SAYS THIS CASE CALLS ON US TO DECIDE WHETHER AN INSURER MAY CONSISTENT WITH. FIVE THIRTY NINE IN THE OFFICIAL PROXIMATE CAUSE DOCTOR AND DENY COVERAGE -- AND THEN THE SAME THING IN HOW WILL VERSUS STATE FARM WE MUST DECIDE WHETHER IN INSURANCE AND SURPRISING COVERAGE UNDER IN ALL RISK INSURANCE. AND ALWAYS PROPERTY INSURANCE POLICY NAY CONTRACTUALLY EXCLUDE COVERAGE -- THERE'S ALSO LANGUAGE IN THE CASE. CASES WHERE SENTENCES ARE WRITTEN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND SO YOU CAN PICK OUT THOSE AND IN SUPPORT OF MANY -- FOR STATUTE THAT IS AN INFORMATIVE. M. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LANGUAGE MOST ACCURATELY -- REPRESENTS AND CASE LAW I WOULD ALSO JUST IN CONCLUSION -- TRY YOUR ATTENTION TO OUR A SENTENCE OR A PARAGRAPH IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TO TOP OF PAGE. THREE ON WHICH WHICH REALLY. OUR EX EXPLAINS THE DANGERS IN TRYING TO CODIFY CASE FINE IF I MAY. ON IT SAYS EFFORTS TO CODIFY CASE LAW ANY PARTICULAR COMPLEX FACT BASED CASE LAW ARE INHERENTLY FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEMS THEY'RE REALLY ONLY TWO POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES. ONE THE BILL ACCOMPLISHES NO ACTUAL CHANGE THE LAW BUT ADDS LITIGATION RISK IS PARTY'S. BATTLE WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE DISPUTES TO CLARIFY WHETHER OR TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK CURRENT CASE LAW MAY HAVE BEEN MADE. AND TO THE BILL UNINTENTIONALLY MAKES CHANGES THAT A COURT INTERPRETS -- TO CHANGE OR ALTER THE RESULTS A PRIOR CASE LAW IS THE RISK OF UNINTENTIONAL AN UNDETERMINED CHANGE TO EXISTING LAW WORTH THE RISK FOR A BILL THAT EXPRESSES THE INTENT. TO NOT CHANGED ON EXISTING LAW AT ALL ON THE LINE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL REFERS TO EARTH MOVEMENTS MUDSLIDES MODE MOVEMENT. THERE IS ADDITIONAL -- INSURANCE COVERAGE AVAILABLE FOR EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE AND FOR FLOOD INSURANCE AND WE WOULD BE VERY NERVOUS TO BE REQUIRED TO COVER THINGS UP THAT WERE NOT COVERED BY AN AUGUST HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY. AND SO I REALIZE THAT IT'S TIME MUST BE FRUSTRATING FOR YOU ALL TO HEAR LAWYERS WHO ARE LIKE INCHES APART. YOU KNOW FIGHTING TO THE DEATH KIND OF TYPE THING AND I AND I REALIZE THAT AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT -- BUT I I JUST GOT TO TELL YOU THAT OUR WAR ON EXPERIENCED -- LAWYERS -- I FEEL THAT OUR LANGUAGE IS THE ONE THAT ACCURATELY REPRESENTS A CASE LINE SO UNLESS THE BILL AS AMENDED TO ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AND ASK FOR YOUR KNOW ABOUT. OF THANK YOU OF MS STONE ARE THERE OTHER FOLKS WHO WISH TO SPEAK. AGAINST [inaudible] THE BILL. THE MORE IS FAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE OUR MONTHLY SHOT ON THEY HAVE A PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS FOR THE REASONS STATED WE ARE BOTH OF THE BILLS WELL THANK YOU. BY THE WAY I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THE FOLKS ATTENDING FOR THE ROOM -- WE WERE WE WERE -- STUCK WITH THIS ROOM AT THE LAST MINUTE AND SO I THE SEATING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AWKWARD BUT TO WERE. WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ITS ICE ONE OF APOLOGIZE FOR THAT A PLEASE GO AHEAD O? FOLKS AGAINST THE BILL. CARA CROSS PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA WE ALSO UP THE BILL I'M APPRECIATE THAT THE SENATOR IS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO HAVE AMENDMENTS THE MY CORRECTED. BUT WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT HAVING LAWYERS AS KIM SAID BE ABLE LOOK CLOSELY AT THIS. THAT WERE GONNA BE IN JEOPARDY OF CODIFYING SOMETHING THAT'S NOT TRUE THE CASE LAW THINKING. MARIA GARCIA WITH MEMBER TRACK ON THE HALF A STATE FARM INSURANCE FOR ALL THE REASONS ARE ELOQUENTLY ARTICULATED BY MISTER AND WE ALSO OPPOSE. CATHERINE PETTIBONE AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION -- WE APPRECIATE THEM AND LET'S BY THE COMMITTEE WE THINK THOSE PUT SOME GUARDRAILS AROUND SOME OF THE CONCERNS. M. HAD WE'VE HAD GOOD CONVERSATIONS ACTUALLY SOME OF OUR WE HAVE JUST VERY NARROW CONCERNS LEFTOVER ABOUT SOME OF HE TERMINOLOGY AND I LOOK FOR TO WORKING AND POTENTIALLY ADDRESSING ALSO THINK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE SPEAKING AGAINST THE BILL -- SENATOR YOU'RE WELCOME -- TO SUMMARIZING CONCLUDE. IF I MAY HELP MY THIS MAN REPRESENTS MORE THAN THIRTY LAWYERS AND YOU KNOW WE CAN'T LAWYERS [inaudible] PAN AFRICAN [inaudible] BUT I'VE I WOULD WELL LIMP WHEN. I THINK IN IN THE YOU KNOW I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE -- THAT THE CASE LAW IS NOT AS CLEAR. OF THE KIDS THAT WE'VE TAKEN THIS LANGUAGE DIRECTLY FROM THE SEMINAL CASES ON THIS ISSUE. MY CONCERN IS THAT THE THE INDUSTRY IS FIGHTING SO HARD NOT TO USE THE LANGUAGE. THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE GOAL HERE IS TO ELIMINATE CONFUSION -- AS WAS INDICATED WHICH JUST WE WE NEED EVERYBODY ON THE SAME PAGE HERE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND TAKING THE AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY. COULDA WOULDA SHOULDA WE HAVE TIGHTENED THIS SHOP WHERE WE'RE BASICALLY MIRRORING THE LANGUAGE SO THAT THERE'S NO DISPUTE AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT. COUPLE WEEKS AGO I GOT AN EMAIL. FROM A WOMAN NAMED MRS CANTON. HER SON JACK. IS -- WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. AND WHEN THE DEBRIS FLOW SWEPT THROUGH THEIR HOME. JACK IN HIS DAD WERE SWEPT AWAY. HIS HIS STATS BODY WAS FOUND. BUT JACK CAN'T IN AGE SEVENTEEN IS STILL MISSING. AND I GOT AN EMAIL FROM HIS MOTHER ASKING. WHY THEY HAVEN'T CLEANED UP THE MUD? BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES THAT HER SON'S REMAINS ARE IN THE MUD. AND THERE ARE SO MANY PLACES AND SO MANY HOMES WHERE THE MUD IS JUST SITTING THERE. SHE ASKED WHY CAN'T THEY CLEAN THIS UP SO THAT I CAN FIND MY SON. AND I THINK THAT'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION THE FACT THAT THERE IS SO MANY OF THESE CLAIMS HAVE NOT YET BEEN RECONCILED. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD DON'T TOUCH THE AREA ON YOUR LAND UNTIL WE RESOLVE THIS CLAIM. AND AS I MENTIONED FOR THEM IT IS THE DETERIORATION OF THEIR PROPERTY. FOR THIS WOMAN IT'S TRYING TO FIND THE REMAINS OF HER SONG. THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR THIS AND THIS BILL WILL. JUST CLARIFY AS WAS TESTIFIED WHICH JUST SEEKING CLARITY THIS IS THE LAW WE WANT TO CODIFY IT SO THAT THERE'S NO MISTAKE. I'M HAPPY DO CONTINUE WORKING IF THERE REALLY IS SOMETHING LEGITIMATE HERE. BUT WE DON'T NEED TO KNOW HOW MANY ANGELS CAN DANCE ON THE HEAD OF A PIN. THE LAW IS THERE. THE NEED IS THERE AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS QUESTIONS THIS IS A COMPLICATED SUBJECT -- WE HAVE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SENATOR JACKSON HAS AGREED WITH THE AMENDMENT WHICH AS MISS PETTIBONE SAID. OF PROVIDES GUARD RAILS A GOING FORWARD. ON A VERY COMPLICATED SUBJECT ANY QUESTIONS MISTER COOLEY YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE ASKING A QUESTION. I GUESS WHEN I LOOK AT THIS BILL -- CERTAIN THAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT THE BILL WERE ACTUALLY STATING A BROAD CONSCRIPTS WILL OF LAW DEALING WITH OFFICIAL PROXIMATE CAUSATION. IT IS NOT WITHSTANDING CERTAIN OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE INSURANCE CODE. FIVE THIRTY FIVE THIRTY TWO ARE. NOW SENATOR PROVISIONS. MY OBSERVATION IS LOOKING THIS BILL IS I ACTUALLY KNOW OF ONLY ONE PLACE IN OUR CODES CERTAIN INSURANCE CODE. WHERE WE ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU FISH PROXIMATE CAUSE ISSUES? CONCURRENT CAUSATION ISSUES. WHO RESPECT THE PERIL OF EARTHQUAKE? IT'S ONE ZERO ZERO EIGHT EIGHT IT IS A SPECIFIC RULE OF LAW IN THE INSURANCE CO DEALING WITH. EFFICIENT CAUSATION AND CONCURRENT CAUSATION. IT DATES TO ABOUT. NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE WHICH IS THE TIME OF THE GARBAGE DECISIONS -- AND WE'RE PASSING A BILL WITHOUT REFERENCE SEEN. AN INSURANCE COOPER VERSION ON THAT SPECIFIC POINT. THE RULE OF LAW STATED THERE IS WHY WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. AND THEN IN THE WAKE OF THAT RULE. WHEN THEY WANT TO SAY? THAT IF YOU HAVE AN EARTHQUAKE% WITH FIRE FOLLOWING -- THE FIRE POLICY STILL PROVIDES COVERAGE ON THE FIRE ISSUES. THERE'S A VERY SPECIFIC STATUTORY RULE ENACTED IN. EIGHTY EIGHT IT COVERS THAT. CRISP AND TO THE POINT. NOTWITHSTANDING SECTION TWENTY ONE NOTHING IN SECTION ONE ZERO ZERO EIGHT EIGHT EXEMPTS INSURER. FROM ITS OBLIGATION OF A FIRE INSURANCE POLICY TO COVER LOSSES OF A FIRE. WHICH JUST BECAUSE BAR FALLS EARTHQUAKE AND AND I SORT OF FEEL IF THE CONCERN IS LAND MOVEMENT MUD FLOW OTHER SORTS OF THINGS ARE RISING FROM A FIRE. AND COVERAGE BEING PROVIDED UNDER FIRE POLICY. WHY DON'T WE JUST SAY THAT? INSTEAD OF ANNOUNCING A BROAD WILL DO AN EFFICIENT PROXIMAL CAUSATION WE'RE DECADES LATER PASSED NEW RULE THAT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING. CONCEPTS IZZY ARE ALREADY IN THEIR COATS IT FEELS TO BE. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SAYING ALL WE ARE DOING JUST SCRIBING CASE LAW. BUT WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY PUT IN THAT CASE ON THE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH IS EVOLVING ARE CALIFORNIA STATUTES [inaudible] AND I JUST FEEL OF YOU WANNA SURE THERE'S COVERAGE WHEN YOU HAVE A FIRE THAT LEASES OTHER THINGS. CAN'T WE JUST SAY THAT. I DO FEEL THAT THE AMENDMENT THAT'S BEEN OFFERED. THAT SAYS YOU SEE YOU'RE GONNA RESPECT DEFENSES OF EXISTENCE IN CASE LAW OR STATUTE. DOES START TO PICK UP ONE ZERO ZERO EIGHT EIGHT WHICH IS CLEARLY A STATUTORY. RULE. BUT AGAIN WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY DISCUSSING THE SORTS OF THINGS SO I FEEL THAT THERE'S THERE'S VERY ESSENTIAL ON THIS AREA THAT WERE ACTING AS IF IT'S NOT ON THE BOOKS WERE NOT REALLY. FUHRMAN THAT IT'S THERE. AND SO IT GIVES ME A A REAL DISQUIET. AS I READ THIS. RIGHT NOW HAVE MY WEAKNESS. YES I THINK YOUR RESPONSES LATER APPROPRIATE PALM [inaudible] THE THE OFFICIAL PROXIMATE CAUSE A DOCTOR AND HOW WITHIN THE ANALYSIS OF IT HOW IN THIS BILL WAS TAKEN. DIRECTLY FROM HALL AND GARVEY. AND IT ISN'T -- IT ISN'T ONLY IF IT IS A. AS I THINK UBER SAID EARLIER APPLIES TO ALL RISK POLICIES NOT JUST FIRE POLICIES SO -- IS A IT'S APPROPRIATE IN THIS CONTEXT BECAUSE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE STATEMENT OF THE LAW TO LIMIT IT -- IN IN SOME OTHER WAY WOULD I THINK CONFUSING ISSUE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY -- HELP AND I THINK THE BEST THING TO DO IN THIS SITUATION IS TO GO WITH THE LAW THAT YOU HAVE RATHER THAN. TRY TO CREATE A NEW -- A NEW PARADIGM AND SO. THE BILL DOES IS IT TAKES THE WHOLE -- DECISION USES THE LANGUAGE OF THE WHOLE DECISION FOR EFFICIENT PROXIMATE CAUSE -- IN APPLIES IT A TO THIS CONTEXT WHICH IS ONE OF THE CONTEXT WHICH OFFICIAL PROXIMATE CAUSE APPLIES TO ORANGES IS A MUCH LIKE. A MISTER FRAZIER HAS QUESTION A MISTER CHAIR WOULD YOU ADMONISH MR COOLEY FOR STEALING MY NOTES YEAH. YOU KNOW I HAD IT ALL WORKED OUT. JOE CUT MY COMPLIMENTS TO MISTER COOLEY FOR HIS KNOWLEDGE I REALLY DO APPRECIATE ME BROUGHT UP A VERY VALID POINT. WHERE WE SHOULD NARROW THIS? OPPORTUNITY -- WE'RE GENERALIZING THIS ON ONE INCIDENT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR MS JACKSON. I WOULD HOPE THAT AND I APPRECIATE YOU LOOKING IN TAKING THIS AMENDMENT. BUT I HOPE THAT THERE'S AN ONGOING PROCESS THAT IT. AS IS AS THIS IF IT GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE. THE YOU YOU COMMIT TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. TO COME TO YES -- BECAUSE I MEAN WE HAVE ANOTHER WHACK AT THIS IT IT YOU KNOW WHAT THE FLOOR. AND I'D WOULD HOPE THAT -- THAT THE CONCLUSION COMING IS A MY PERCEPTION IS THIS IS A GENERALIZATION OF AN INCIDENT THERE'S NOTHING MORE. THEN ME FEELING FOR THE THAT POOR MOTHER WHO LOST HER SON AND HAS. NO OPPORTUNITY GET THAT INDIVIDUAL YET OKAY I LIVE THAT. BUT I ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS GOING TO AFFECT THE STATE AS A WHOLE [inaudible] AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE I WOULD HOPE THAT THE OPPOSITION AND YOU CAN WORK TOWARDS A SOLUTION AND HOW WE CAN GET THE S. OR A COMPROMISE. WE'RE BOTH NOT SATISFIED BECAUSE THAT'S A COMPROMISE. WELL I CAN CERTAINLY COMMIT TO THAT IF WE CAN'T GET TO A COMPROMISE THAT I WILL NOT BRING THE BILL ON THE FLOOR -- IF ARE. UP PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT -- WELL THIS IS A SINGLE INCIDENT WE NOW ARE HAVING FIRES UP IN LAKE COUNTY THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE THIS THE SOUL INCIDENT -- EVEN THOUGH IT DID OCCUR IN MY DISTRICT THAT WE WERE JUST THE ONES THAT WERE MOST. UNFORTUNATE AT LEAST AT THIS POINT TIME SO -- WEIRD TRYING TO SEE CLARA SPAN THE LAW AND I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS THAT OF MISTER COOLEY ADDRESSED AND WE ARE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO MAKING SOME REFERENCE TO THIS. BUT YOU SEE AN EARTHQUAKE IS GENERALLY NOT A COVERED. EVENT IS NOT SO. SO THAT AIM MUCH OF FIRE MUCH LIGHT THAT OCCURS AS A RESULT OF AN EARTHQUAKE UNLESS YOU HAVE EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE WOULD ARGUABLY NOT. BE COVERED WE ARE LOOKING AT THE INCIDENTS WHERE MOST PEOPLE NOT EVERYBODY IN PROBABLY MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INSURANCE HAVE FIRE INSURANCE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS THE LAW SAYS THAT IF YOU HAVE FIRE INSURANCE. THAT IS THE OFFICIAL PROXIMATE CAUSE OF EARTH MOVEMENT NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND BUT IF IF YOU'RE COVERED WITH FIRE INSURANCE AND A A MUD FLOOR MUCH LIGHTER WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT OCCURS. THAT WAS ESSENTIALLY KICKED OFF IF YOU WILL BY THAT DOMINO. THEN AND AND YOU QUALIFY WITH FOR RICHARD SETS THE AMENDMENT WE TOOK THAT AFFIRMS THAT ANY DEFENSES THE INSURANCE COMPANY MIGHT HAVE -- DID TO THAT BASIC FIRE INSURANCE. A POLICY WILL OF BE IN PLAY AS YOU SEE COMPENSATION OF THE FOR THE DEBRIS FLOW. A SO THAT SHOULD CLARIFIED AGAIN. WHAT THE ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE IS WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE CASE LAW LANGUAGE AND PUT IT IN THE NEGATIVE? OR WE'RE GOING TO USE THE CASE LAW LANGUAGE AND THE CASE ALL LANGUAGE TALKS ABOUT IT IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND BY SWITCHING THAT THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT. IT'S NOT THE SAME THING. AND THAT'S WHEN YOU GOING TO GET FOR LITIGATION MY GOAL HERE IS. TO AVOID LITIGATION IS TO CREATE THAT CLARITY AND I US THE SUBMIT THEM AND WE WILL WORK I THINK THAT -- MISTER COOLEY HAS A GOOD POINT WE DON'T WANT THERE TO BE SO MANY DIFFERENT REFERENCES AND IF THERE'S A A PURPOSE TO A A REFERENCE TO A CROSS REFERENCE. IN THE SECTION TEN THOUSAND EIGHTY EIGHT IF. I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO WORK ON THAT SO WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO UNDERSTAND IS WHAT. I'M TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE. AND AND I'M HAPPY TO KEEP WORKING TO GET TO THAT GOAL. WE APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THAT. MS STONE AS YOU'V HEARD THAT THERE ISN'T A VICTIM. WHOSE LIPMAN BEEN NOT RECOVERED I WOULD LOSE HOPE THAT WE CAN ACCELERATE THROUGH YOUR ASSOCIATION PP OF THIS THE INSURANCE AGENCIES THERE. BUT DIRECTLY INVOLVES HIS MOTHER CAN [inaudible] GET CLOSER [inaudible] AND SELECT. SO WITH THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR SAYING THE GONNA WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION HE WON'T BRING IT TO THE FLOOR UNLESS YOU COME TO A COMPROMISE THANK YOU. AND MISTER [inaudible] GRAYSON. THANK YOU CHAIR AND JUST WANNA DO -- THEY SAVED THE EASY STUFF FOR ME I GUESS BUT I HAVE COUPLE QUESTIONS AND I'D I DID WANT TO CLARIFY WHAT -- MY COLLEAGUE JUST ENDED WITH -- BECAUSE I DIDN'T HEAR RESPONSE BUT BUT NO YOU YOU WERE BUSY -- YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE GOING TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION AND IF THEY DIDN'T COME TO A COMPROMISE YOU WOULD BRING IT TO THE FLOOR. THAT THAT'S CORRECT OKAY SO MY OTHER QUESTION WHICH IS NOT ON THE OTHER HAND I REALLY DO WANT THE OPPOSITION TO WORK WITH ME ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S SO THEN THEY WIN YET IF YOU WELL BY. SO LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY A FIGHT IF IF WE ARE ABLE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT. ALL PRESENT ON THE FLOOR AND IF WE'RE NOT AND I CAN EXPLAIN WHY AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TALK WITH EACH OF YOU AND IF YOU FEEL THAT WE'RE BEING. REASONABLE AND THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY BEING REASONABLE I WOULD THEN ASK FOR YOUR VOTE AS WELL I WANT TO GET THEM TO THE TABLE TO IT TO WORK WITH US TO COME DIAZ. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO COME TWO YES THEY SAY OH WE WORKED IN NO WE COULDN'T COME TO AN AGREEMENT I WANT THEM TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OF INCENTIVE TO GET THIS BILL OUT AS IS HARD TO AND THEN I THANK YOU FOR THE CLARITY THAT HELPS. IN THE SAY YOU WERE INCHES APART. I HOPE SO I I I REALLY WANT TO GET THIS IS MICRO IS JUST I MEAN I'M SEEING A SHAKING HEAD HERE ALRIGHT WELL THAT'S A GOOD SIGN WE WOULD [inaudible] WE FOUND WELCOME [inaudible] WHICH SITUATIONS ON THE PROPONENTS FEELS THAT OUR LANGUAGE DOES NOT HAVE. AND SO IF YOU CAN TELL IF YOUR FOLKS CAN TELL ME HOW ARE OF THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE IN THAT CASE AND HAVE A SEND IT BACK SO THOSE DOZENS OF LAWYERS. RIGHT. TRY TO ADDRESS OKAY WHERE IT WANTED TO OR NOT GOING TO DEBATE THAT NOW BUT THE BY THINK THE DOOR IS OPEN. FOR FURTHER CONVERSATIONS AND ATTEMPTS. TO TO DO CAN MORE NARROWING. THE UP. POSSIBLY. IF IF WE CAN DO THAT AN ACCOMPLISHED THE GOAL OF GAINING CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY AND AVOID LITIGATION OVER ARGUING ABOUT WHAT THE WORDS MEAN. I AM THERE. I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT ONE ONE LAST QUESTION. ADD BECAUSE YOU WOULD DELIVER TO US A VERY TRAGIC STORY IN MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS CONTINUE TO BE WITH THE VICTIMS -- WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR? AND SO MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME UNDERSTAND IS. WAS THE ARGUMENT -- THAT TO THIS PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL WHO STILL HASN'T FOUND THE BODY OF HER SON WAS THE ARGUMENT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE INSURANCE OR THAT THE INSURANCE COVERAGE IS NOT THERE FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING IT. WAS THE ARGUMENT THEY'RE NOT DOING THINGS FAST ENOUGH AND WILL YOUR BILL MAKE THINGS WORK FASTER. WELL THAT THAT THE CONCERN IS NOT THAT THE BOY'S BODY AND I HATE HIM. YES THIS YOUNG MAN'S -- WERE LIKELY SWEPT DOWN. THROUGH THIS DEBRIS FLOW AND THE DEBRIS FLOW WENT FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT FIVE MILES. AND IT ENDED UP IN THE OWE IT STOPPED ONLY BY THE OCEAN. SO ANYWHERE. IN THAT AREA THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THIS. YOUNG MAN'S REMAINS ARE LOCATED. BUT THE FACT THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN REMOVING THE MUD FROM SO MANY OF THESE HOMES AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE OF THE THE CASES HAVEN'T BEEN RESOLVED. THEY'RE STILL PENDING A DETERMINATION ABOUT WHAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES GOING TO DO. SO IT IS A PART OF IT IS PERHAPS CONFUSION ON THE PARTS OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THE ADJUSTERS COME IN AND MANY OF THEM HAVE NEVER HAD. EXPERIENCES SIMILAR TO THIS WE WANT TO BE CLEAR AND AND SOME ADJUSTERS HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC AND SOME HAVE SAID I HAVE TO GO BACK AND GET APPROVAL. AND THAT APPROVAL WHICH SIX MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD IN THAT APPROVAL STILL. HASN'T COME SO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP EXPEDITE DUE PROCESS I ABSOLUTE IN THE FUTURE FOR FUTURE FOR IN THE FUTURE CORRECT YOUR INCIDENTS -- I APOLOGIZE I'VE TO GO PRESENT A BILL TO SENATE LABOR COMMITTEE VICE CHAIR MAYES WILL TAKE OVER AND I THINK -- WORK VERY CLOSE TO VOTING ON YOUR BILL ALTHOUGH THERE WERE A COUPLE I THINK MR GIPSON THAT QUESTION BUT IT'S WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FIRST BY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AT THE ROBUST CONVERSATION ALSO -- AND FORTH ESPECIALLY -- ERASE IN -- AS HE NO IT'S AND HIS LAW THAT HE READ. CLARIFY SOME THINGS IN MY HEAD -- I WANT -- TO ALSO -- PIGGYBACK ON MR FRASER'S OF COMMENTS AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK -- WITH THE OPPOSITE SIDE TO TRY TO GET TO A A YES THAT BOTH CAN AGREE -- TO BCAUSE I WAS VERY CONFUSED UNTIL MISTER FRASER OBSCURE DON'T MISS COOLEY -- PROVIDED HIS ITERATION OF THE OF THE PARTICULAR POSITION AND SO I'M GONNA RESERVE I'M GOING TO VOTE YES TODAY -- WITH UNDERSTANDING. AND AND YOUR WORDS THAT YOU WILL WORK. AND IF FOR WHATEVER REASON -- UK COME TO AGREEMENT -- AND YOU STILL WANT TO PROCEED THEN YOU WILL COME TO EACH MEMBER AND HAVE A DIALOGUE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU PUTS PUT ON THE FLOOR AND I WOULD ALSO ASK THE OTHER SIDE TO THE SAME EXACT THING. BUT I'M GONNA MY RIGHT TO VOTE FOR MY POSITION -- WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU GUYS WOULD WORK THIS THING OUT AND TRY TO GET TO A YES SO THAT I FEEL COMFORTABLE GOING -- ON THE FLOOR IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND AGAIN MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE FAMILY BECAUSE WHETHER YOUR CHILD IS. THREE WHO LIKE WE LOST OUR CHILD A THREE YEARS AGO -- OR WHETHER THEY'RE YOU KNOW FIFTY YEARS OLD CHILD IS A CHILD -- MY HEART GOES OUT THAT FAMILIES JUST DO THE WHOLE ENTIRE DEVASTATION SO THAT'S WHERE I'M AT TODAY WE GET WE HOPE THAT YOU GET TO A YES THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DODD MISSED YOU. BUT I JUST WANTED TO A DO YOU KNOW WHAT AND I'M A MEMBER GIPSON JUST SAT -- DISPIRITO WHEN YOU GET ALL OF DISCOUNT A COMMITTEE WILL GO. TO WELL LISTEN NEXT COMMITTEE WILL LOOK. GO TO THE FLOOR FLOOR AND I THINK IT'S IT WILL GO TO THE FLOOR. OKAY I WOULD REALLY -- HOPING THAT THE YOU CAN. COME WILL COME UP WITH SOME COMPROMISE WITH OPPOSITION. BY BOAT TODAY WERE JUST A COURTESY VOTE WHOM TO MOVE TO A BILL FOR FOR MICHELLE THANK YOU. ACTUALLY I HAD SOME QUESTIONS AS WELL IN -- AND MISTER COOLEY NO I WAS -- THIS THAT MISTER GIBSON CLEAR AND WONDERING WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT LIVING COME TO SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT BUT FOR INCHES APART. IS THAT POSSIBLY VOTE TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR AT THAT TODAY -- AND I DON'T KNOW MISTER COOL IF YOU GOT ANY SUGGESTIONS ON PINE LANGUAGE -- OR IF NOT WE NEED TO GO BACK BUT WELL I HAVE MY EXPERT HERE TODAY AND PERHAPS -- WE CAN HAVE HIM A DISCUSS WITH MISTER COOLEY I FRANKLY THINK THAT -- THAT THERE IS SOME VALIDITY TO THAT CONCERNED -- I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'LL SATISFY THE OPPOSITION KEEPS INSISTING WE USE THE NEGATIVE TERM. FOR WE WOULD JUST ONE A SORT OF IMPRINT THE LANGUAGE OF THE CASE LAW WHICH IS GOOD WHICH YOU FOR A PERIOD OF FORTY FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN THE LAW -- OR FIFTY FIVE YEARS NOW FIFTY FIVE YEARS HAS BEEN. THE LAW I'D I DON'T WANNA UPSET THAT -- SO -- BUT I'M CERTAINLY I THINK THAT -- IF IF REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN AGREE WE'VE TAKEN AN AMENDMENT THAT. ADDRESS THAT CAME A LONG WAY I THOUGHT SORENSEN OPPOSITION BECAUSE THE BIG CONCERN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT ABOUT -- ISSUES WHERE YOU REALLY NOT ENTITLED TO FIRE COVERAGE AND THAT ISN'T MY GOAL MICHAEL WAS IF YOU ARE ENTITLED TO IT. THEN YOU CAN GET A YEAR INSURANCE WILL COVER THE THESE THE DEBRIS FLOW THAT IS THE PROXIMATE CAUSE AND SO WE TOOK THAT LANGUAGE AND AND I I BELIEVE THAT THAT DEALT WITH WHAT I THINK IS THE REAL ISSUE. BUT WERE HAPPY TO TALK I I THINK THE ARGUMENT THAT'S MADE THAT'S BEING MADE -- HIS. IT IS WAS GONNA TAKE SOME DISCUSSION BUT I THINK MR COOLIES THE CONCERN IS A I THINK IS A IS WELL TAKEN. AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT SO WE GOT KEEP WORKING OF BUT I THINK THAT -- AYE WE CAN TRY TO DO THAT TODAY IF IF MY MILTON WHO JUST FOOD THE COMMENT THAT -- THE WHOLE CASE IN THE GARVEY CASE BOTH -- MAKE REFERENCE I BELIEVE MISTER COOLEY TO THE STATUTES AND YOU KNOW IN RECITING THE LANGUAGE FROM THE WHOLE CASE A AND INCORPORATING THEM -- ESSENTIALLY WE ARE IN INCORPORATING THE BETTER YOU COULD. YOU KNOW MAKE THE SAME REFERENCE PERHAPS [inaudible] SO. FIRST PERSONALLY I AND AND THIS IS JUST ME REFLECTING UPON THIS I WOULD JUST STATE THE RULE AS IS YOU RESULT STATUTE DOES NOT CONCUR BECAUSE EACH ONE BUT THE FIRE FOLLOWING. NOTWITHSTANDING SECTION TWENTY EIGHTY ONE TWENTY EIGHTY ONE IS A BIG PROVISION INSURANCE CODE THAT DEFINES A FIRE POLICY GENERALLY. SO YOU'RE SAYING. BY STATUTE WE SAY WHAT FIRE COVERAGE IS. NOT WITHSTANDING THAT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T BUILD ARE GOING ON TWENTY ONE A LANDSLIDE MUD SLIDE MY VOTE TO BRING FLOOR OTHER SUMMER EARTH MOVEMENT. WHICH IS CAUSED BY OR FOLLOWS A FIRE. DOES NOT EXEMPT ENSURE FROM ITS OBLIGATION UNDER FIRE INSURANCE POLICY TO COVER THE LOSSES. SO I THINK A VERY. TAILORED STATEMENT THAT JUST SAYS. IF YOU HAVE THE SORTS A LOSSES ARISING FROM A FIRE [inaudible] THEY'RE COVERED [inaudible] AND THAT. THAT GET YOU OUT OF THE REALM OF DEBATE OVER WHAT WAS THE OFFICIAL PROXIMATE CAUSE. HE JUST SAYS WELL IF YOU GOT THE FACT PATTERN OF A FIRE. AND THESE THINGS INTO. IT IS CONTEMPLATE WITHIN THE COVERAGE OF A FIRE POLICY UNDER. TWENTY EIGHTY ONE I THINK THAT. FORD'S GOOD COVERAGE. IF FRANKLY [inaudible] TEN PARDON ME. FOR MANY MANY DECADES UNDER MARK REISNER IS BOOK A DANGEROUS PLACE WHICH IS ABOUT CALIFORNIA. AND THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS THAT TRANSVERSELY RANGE SO DRY. VERY STEEP CANYONS VERY STEEPER BRAINS. THE WHOLE HYDROLOGY OF THE SOUTH FACE OF THE SAN GABRIELS IS SUCH. THAT ONCE WATER SEARCH RUNNING DOWNHILL IT IS A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM. AND SO MUCH OF THE WORK. AND THE WATER SYSTEM IN THERE REVENGE OF SOUTHERN COMFORT KIND OF CONTROL THAT CONTROLLED MUDFLOWS CONTROL THE BOULDERS. THAT GOES BACK TO THE THIRTIES. SO I THINK THERE'S A LIMITS PAYROLL. THAT EXIST THERE ARE RISING FROM THE EXPANDING DOWN RESISTS BURGER I THINK FOR THOSE MOUNTAINS. I ACTUALLY THINK YOU'RE GAINING SOMETHING. TO STATE CLEARLY THAT. SOMETHING TO WRITE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A FIRE IN THE SINGS IN SU YOU'VE GOT COVERAGE I IF IF I JUST DATA PASTA I JUST YOU KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE LANGUAGE OF THE YOU KNOW PERHAPS WE COULD WE COULD TALK ABOUT THAT NOW. IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE HAVE LIPS DRAFTED HERE AND YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BET. AND THAT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TO SENATOR KERRY. WELL I I THINK RATHER THAN TRY. TO NEGOTIATED THIS MOMENT I LIKE I SAID I THINK I'VE BEEN CLEAR WHEN I'M TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IF WE CAN DO THAT. I'M HAPPY. TO DEAL WITH THE LANGUAGE SHOULD THAT'S GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL AND REACH. A YOU KNOW AGAIN IT IS AS LONG AS WE ALL ARE ARGUING DEBATING IT AND WORKING IN GOOD FAITH TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL. I AM A HUNDRED AND 20% COMMITTED TO THAT. IT'S FRAZIER THANK YOU AND SENATOR I JUST I APPRECIATE IT YOU KNOW ALL THE COACHING THAT I'VE DONE FOR MR COOLIES WORKOUT. AND I'M SURE HE APPRECIATES IT AS WELL DOES -- AGAIN. I REALLY DO ADMIRE MISTER COOLEY FOR HIS CAUSE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS IN HIS HAS EXPERTISE AND I ACTUALLY DO. A UTILIZE A LOT OF HIS INFORMATION THROUGH COMMITTEE -- BECAUSE OF HIS PROFESSIONALISM. OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT ALSO IS THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ON CONSUMER. OR THE INSURED HANDED WHEAT LOOKING IDENTIFIED THAT WE'RE NOT. PUMMELING IN THEM WITH THE OPPORTUNITY OF OF HIGHER PREMIUMS BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE. WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEM BUT ALSO NOT PERSECUTE THEM IN THEIR POCKETBOOK. WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL IS SO SIMPLE AND BASICALLY SIMPLY REAFFIRMED THE CASE LAW BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE I WANT CLARITY. I WANT CONSISTENCY AND I WANT THE FOLKS WHO ARE A SUFFERING THROUGH THESE EXTRAORDINARY TRAGEDIES AND AS WAS MENTIONED A THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING -- WITH OUR CLIMATE CHANGE WITH THE FIRES THAT ARE BURNING KNOW THIS FIRE THAT LARGEST. WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY WHICH WAS IN MY DISTRICT A OCCURRED IN DECEMBER. A UNHEARD OFF IN CALIFORNIA. A TO HAVE A FIRE IN DECEMBER SO WE HAVE NOW A TWELVE MONTH THE YEAR FIRE SEASON. TINDER DRY WEATHER -- THE THE HUMIDITY AT CERTAIN POINTS WHEN THIS 1%. MEAN A THING SAID ARE ABSOLUTELY CATASTROPHIC IN THE WHOLE STATE IS POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO THESE PROBLEMS SO THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY PAY THEIR INSURANCE PREMIUMS WHATEVER THEY ARE. SHOULD HAVE THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE COVERED IF THESE THE A MAJOR CAP CATASTROPHES. A OCCUR AND AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE CLEAR AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET IS THAT CLARITY BASED UPON WHAT HAS BEEN CASE LAW ON THE STATE FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. THAT'S THE GOAL WHEN IT AGAIN WE'VE WE'VE UNDERSTOOD MS STONE TO SAY THAT THERE'S NOT BEEN ANY -- INSURANCE COMPANY THAT HAS RAPIDLY REFUSED TO TO RESPOND TO YOUR INCIDENT IN YOUR DISTRICT WELL WE CANNOT CLARIFY THAT NO NO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT HAVE NOT RESOLVED THESE CLAIMS YET THAT THEY'RE STILL OUT FOR CONSIDERATION. AND THAT IS TWO SIDES TO A STORY AND IT COULD BE ALSO THE INSURED WHOSE. THEY'VE BEEN UP A PROBLEM ALSO THAT SO I GUESS IT'S NOT ALWAYS SURE INSURANCE CO AND A AND THAT'S WHY HAS THE WITNESS COME TODAY WHO'S BEEN DOING THIS SO IF THERE'S CLARITY IT HELPS EVERYBODY [inaudible] YEAH. SO I THINK IF A BUG BUT WE NEED A MOTION HERE BUT DAMN. IF I WAS TO MAKE MOTION SOUNDS LIKE THAT FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM THE COMMITTEE THERE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT COOLEY WAS SUGGESTING IS PROBABLY WHERE WE WANT TO GET TOO OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE THE AUTHOR NAM AND YOU'VE ALSO COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK OUT WHAT WORK WITH FOLKS -- BUT WITH THAT I WILL NAM ENTERTAIN A MOTION. THEN SHARED HER. YEAH MIKE'S -- THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION IS AYE WITH THE AMENDMENT -- AND I DO TAKE -- THE SENATOR AT HER WORD THAT SHE'S GOING TO CAN WELL I'LL HAVE THE ABILITY TO RETHINK IT ON THE FLOOR DEPENDING ON WHAT. WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN NOW AND THEN SO I MOVED THAT DID I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHURCH RECOMMENDATIONS AND I WITHIN THE AMENDMENT? SOME OF THAT. ALRIGHT SO WE HAVE A A MOTION BY CARRIER O.

FIRST DIE WIVES -- EXCEPT THE TECHNICAL COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LISTEN ANALYSIS TO ADDRESS A DRAFTING AIR -- THE PRACTICE OF APPORTIONMENT OR REDUCTION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS DUE TO NON INDUSTRIAL FACTORS HAS BEEN A PART OF OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FIVE HOWEVER CONTINUES TO BE AN AREA OF DISPUTE IN LITIGATION LAST YEAR THE COURT OF APPEALS RULED IN THE CITY OF JACKSON THAT PER PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS CAN BE REDUCED ON THE BASIS. OF GENETICS AND INHERITABLE CHARACTERISTICS THE COURT BELIEVES THAT THIS RULING WAS IN KEEPING WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS PRESIDENT. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE DECISION MAY THE STAKEHOLDERS BELIEVE THAT OPEN THE DOOR TO APARTMENT BASED ON FACTORS ARE CURRENTLY THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY PERMITTED THAT INCLUDES RACE GENDER AND NATIONAL ORIGIN. S. B. EIGHT NINETY NINE ADDRESSES THIS CONCERN BY EXPLICITLY EXCLUDING JET RACE GENDER AND NATIONAL ORIGIN AS A POSSIBLE FACTORS AFTER WORKING WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS FOR NEARLY A YEAR I AM PROUD. TO PORT THIS -- VERSION OF THE BILL IS -- AND HAD NO FORMAL OPPOSITION AS SENATOR -- DO YOU HAVE WHEN YOU HAVE WITNESSES. OKAY WHEN SPORT WITNESSES IN FAVOR.

UNDER EXISTING LAW INJURED WORKERS WHO ARE TEMPORARILY DISABLED. AND UNABLE TO WORK DUE TO WORKPLACE ENTRY MUST RECEIVE A TEMPORARY DISABILITY BENEFIT WHICH SERVES AS A FORM OF PARTIAL WAGE BENEFIT. I TT BENEFIT CAN ONLY BE SENT TO THE INJURED WORKER YOU BUY PAPER CHECK OF THE PROTECT POSIT -- THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THEM TO A USING AT USE OF BENEFIT. TO OUR CAR -- AND FACT A COUPLE STATES HAVE SOME GOOD. SURE IT'S PROGRAMS CREATE THE PILOT PROGRAM -- ALL PLAYERS BE BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. ABSOLUTELY ASK WHEN I VOTE AND WITNESSES SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS YOUR MEMBERS ABOUT THE AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION IN LIEU OF THE TO MOTIONS -- I WILL BE BRIEF WHICH IS TO SAY THAT -- WE WOULD ECHO -- DOCTOR PANTS COMMENTS WE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD WE THINK IT BEAR BRINGS BENEFITS FOR BOTH INJURED WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS AND INSURERS. IT'S ONE OF THE BALANCE BILLS WERE ALWAYS SEEKING IN THE SYSTEM IT ALSO BUILDS ON A NUMBER PROTECTIONS. GIVES BOTH EMPLOYERS INSURERS OPTIONS WHETHER THEY WANT ENGAGE IN THE PROGRAM IT REQUIRES WRITTEN CONSENT FROM THE INJURED WORKER SO THEY TO HAVE THAT OPTION -- THERE ARE ALL THE FEES ARE BORNE BY ARE ALMOST ALL THE FEES ARE BORNE BY. ON THE INJURED WORKER I'M SORRY BY THE EMPLOYER AND THE INSURER -- ADDITIONALLY THIS IS A PILOT PROJECT WILL BE BACK BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS BODY IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AFTER STUDIES CONDUCTED BY THE COMMISSION ON HEALTH SAFETY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION SO. A MEETING IT'S GOOD PIECE PUBLIC POLICY AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR GO AHEAD AS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN NOR WOULD I BE HAVE A ZENITH INSURANCE COMPANY -- COINCIDENTALLY ARC HE'S BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK IN THIS SPACE HOPE. THIS KIND OF AUTHORIZATION -- THEY INFORMED ME THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IRISH ISSUE TO THE STATE CALIFORNIA FROM CHECKS THAT ARE LOST -- ARE MISPLACED -- AND THAT'S A BENEFIT THIS BILL COULD TAKE CARE. A LOT OF AGRICULTURE TURNS THERE FOR A NUMBER WORKERS THEY DEAL WITH ARE UNBANKED IN THOSE WORKERS AND UP [inaudible] ANDERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH TAKE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS WE FROM THEIR CHECKS THAT COULD BE GOING TO MEALS AND FOOD AND WE HAVE EXPENSES FOR THE FAMILY. AND LASTLY THEIR WORKERS ARE ON TV AND PREVENT TT -- OF THESE CARDS CAN BE RELOADED REMOTELY AND THAT RESOLVES ISSUES BUSINESS DAYS AND HOLIDAYS AND THAT TYPE OF THINGS. SO WE ARE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR OTHER. PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL HOW MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BILL GAZA WHICH REPRESENTING ENSURE CARD. I ENSURE CARD IS THE LARGEST NATIONAL PROVIDER OF BENEFITS BY THIS MEANS. AND HAS BEEN IN FACT PROVIDING BENEFITS BY THIS MEANS IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE PAST -- TEN YEARS. BOB WE REQUEST A WE WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THAT RAISE ONE ISSUE AND REQUEST AMENDMENT AND THAT IS THAT WE ALL BELIEVE THAT THE REQUIREMENT FOR WRITTEN CONSENT. IS GOING TO MAKE THE PROGRAM. OF MUCH LESS -- EFFECTIVE INSURE CARD OPERATES IN FORTY SEVEN STATES ARE ONLY SIX REQUIRE. A WRITTEN CONSENT ET DE DOES NOT REQUIRE WRITTEN CONSENT FOR THESE BENEFITS SO. THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT REQUIRE. WRITTEN CONSENT WHAT WE THINK AND THERE ARE A HOST OF NOBODY NOBODY OBJECTS TO THE IDEA THAT THE BENEFITS SHOULD ONLY BE AVAILABLE. WITH THE CONSENT OF THE RECIPIENT. THE QUESTION IS DO YOU GAIN ANYTHING BY PUTTING THE US A STEP BEYOND TO REQUIRE THE CONSENT TO BE. ALL IN WRITING [inaudible] BOMB. IN THE A HOST OF CASES IN THE UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW WHICH CONSENT IS REQUIRED. THE CONSENT IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE IN WRITING BECAUSE WHEN YOU REQUIRE THE CONSENT IN WRITING YOU HAVE TO SEND OUT A FORM IN THE RECIPIENT HAS TO FILL IT OUT. AND RETURN IT IN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CASES. THAT'S JUST NOT GOING NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND THE ARM. PERSON DOES NOT TO THE RECIPIENT DOES NOT GET THE BENEFIT OF THE ABOVE. PROGRAM. RIGHT IN THE INSURANCE WERE THE TYPICAL PROCESS IS THE CONSENT IS RECORDED IN THE CLAIMS FILE SO WE REQUEST THE REMOVAL OF THE WRITTEN CONCENTRIC GARMENT ALTHOUGH AS I SAID WHY DON'T. FOR A MOMENT DISPUTE THE REQUIREMENT FOR CONSENT AND WE DO SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU SIR ARE THERE OTHER FOLKS WISHING I'D I DON'T THINK WE WERE FINISHED WITH THE SUPPORT. PERSONS OTHER OTHER POKES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. GO AHEAD PARK SEGMENT PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS ASSOCIATION AMERICA AT LIGHT SPEED SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO REFERENCE THAT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WOULD SUGGEST WE CONTINUE. WORKING OTHER WRITTEN CONSENT DISMISS SORT OUT WHAT SAID IT'S A HIGH STANDARD. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF OUR COMPANY THAT OPERATES IN ALL THE FORTY SEVEN STATES MISTER DOUBTS TALK ABOUT SAYS IS A 30% TAKE UP RATES. BUT WHEN YOU ADD WRITTEN CONSENT THAT. TAKE A BREAK DROPS 25% BRING CONSENT MAY BE AN UNNECESSARY BURDEN BECAUSE THIS IS A BENEFIT TO THE INJURED WORKER THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS JASON SHELTER ON BEHALF OF THE COMPENSATION I RESPECTFULLY SUPPORTING THE BILL WITHOUT A TIE [inaudible] NNOVA. YEAH LAURIE CAMERA WITHOUT A TIE. LAURIE CAMERON BEHALF OF ANTHEM OF WORKERS COMPENSATION AND MEDICS HEALTHCARE AND ALSO -- AB ONE CALL MEDIC. YEAH VERY GOOD FOR EMPLOYERS AREN'T WE WITH SUPPORT NO FEES IN THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. OF ANY OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. WE HEARD FROM ONE AYE I MEAN THE TWEETER CATEGORY MARGARET LASTING CARE ABOUT FIRST ON BEHALF OF FIRST DATA WERE GLOBAL PAYMENT PROCESSOR ONE OF LARGE PEER PROCESSORS THE WORLD WE OFFER PAYROLL CARDS -- IN THAT CALIFORNIA FOR MANY EMPLOYERS -- WE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF THE BILL IN THE THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE BILL WE THINK IS VERY LAUDABLE OUR PARTICULAR CONCERN. THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE RESTRICTION ON OUT OF NETWORK ATM FEES IF A AN EMPLOYEE IS BANKED -- IF IF A WORKER IS PAINT -- AND THEY'RE USING THEIR REGULAR ATM WE ALL DO UNFORTUNATELY WHEN THAT. WHEN WE USE THESE CARDS -- WE ALSO FEEL THAT OUR BIG CONCERN IF IT UP EMPLOYEE IS CURRENTLY GETTING A PAYROLL CARD WHERE THEY MAY BE BEARING COSTS FOR OUT OF NETWORK ATM FEESWE WOULD IT COULD CREATE CONFUSION. OR UNCERTAINTY FOR THEM THEY MAY HAVE TO GET A NEW CAR. IF THESE FEES ARE AND ARE STRICTLY BAY AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO SEE A WORKABLE PROGRAM -- WE'D LIKE TO AND WE VERY MUCH WANT THE BILL TO CONTINUE WE JUST THINK THAT THIS IS A REALISTIC POINT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER. IN TERMS OF HOW THESE CARDS WOULD WORK IN THE MARKETPLACE SO I APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. OTHER PERSONS WITH THE CONCERNS ARE TWO WIENERS -- AND ALSO TO ENERGY SETTLING WITH CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION -- YOU HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL -- THE BILL IS UNPRECEDENTED IN THE VERY PRESCRIPTIVE WAY IT BANDS OR RESTRICTS FEES THAT CAN BE CHARGED ON THE PRODUCT -- EVEN IN THE STATES AYE EBT PROGRAM AND ALSO IN THE STATES -- YOU AYE PROGRAM THERE IS NOTHING IN STATUTE AS PRESCRIPTIVE AS THIS AND THAT THAT'S A CONCERN FOR US ISSUERS WILL WANT TO PURCHASE. PROGRAM AND THAT'S GOING TO ULTIMATELY DRIVE UP COSTS -- ULTIMATELY BELIEVE IT AMENDMENT SHOULD BE MADE TO THE BILL TO ALLOW DE A AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE -- SORRY WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE TO HAVE AUTHORITY TO SET THE FEES RATHER THAN MANDATING IT IN STATUTE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE WE'RE CONCERNED WITH THE MEASURE. OTHER PERSONS WITH CONCERNS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CLIFF BURKE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE C. USA -- WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE MEASURE IN THE THAT MEASURES GOAL OF GETTING CARDS WE THINK OUR TECHNOLOGIES BOTH. MORE EFFICIENT MORE EFFECTIVE CHEAPER GOVERNMENT SO WE THINK THIS BILL IS A GOOD THING -- WE DO YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS YOU'VE HEARD WE DO NOT REALLY BELIEVE THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO PUT INTO STATUTE WHICH FEES ARE OKAY AND WHICH AREN'T. THAT IT SHOULD BE LEFT TO IN ESSENCE THE REGULATORY AGENCY THROUGH THE RFP PROCESS OF THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS OF THE CONTRACT GENERALLY THAT IS WORK WELL WITH YOU I AND OTHER STATE PROGRAMS RECOGNIZING THIS IS SORT OF A HYBRID PROGRAM. AND IT'S A PILOT -- SO IT'S IT'S NOT AS CLEAR AS ONE IS A STATE AGENCY BUT AGAIN WE THINK PUTTING IN STATUTE SPECIFIC FEES WALKING THOSE INTO LAW TAKES AWAY FLEXIBILITY IN CERTAIN THE GO SHADING WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AND I WAS JUST THE ADHESIVE DOES NOT CHARGE ANY FEES [inaudible] BANKS BUT WE DO NOT CHARGE ANY FEES TO EITHER THE STATE OR THE PRIVATE COMPANY IN THESE PROGRAMS. THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING THEIR BUSINESS MODEL HAS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR COSTS ARE IN THERE FOR HAVING SOME FLEXIBILITY RATHER THAN WALK INTO STATUTE IS A GOOD THING -- BUT ANY WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS -- OR CONCERNS EXPRESSED THERE ARE NONE COMMITTEE MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR ON THIS BILL. ALRIGHT TO MISTER PAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONCLUDE. SAID I THANK YOU AND YEAH I APPRECIATE THE THE SUPPORT TO THE FOURTH FOR THIS BILL. I THINK WHEN THE THINGS THAT -- WERE TRYING TO BE SURE IS IS THAT -- THAT THE THE EMPLOYEES WHO RECEIVING THESE THAT DISABILITY BENEFITS -- WELL I GET THE FULL VALUE OF THEIR BENEFITS THAT -- BY PARTICIPATING IN THIS THAT THERE ISN'T SOME REDUCTION IN VALUE BUT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE GONNA CONTINUE WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE. ON THE PILOT SO. I I THINK HOPEFULLY WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE WORKERS THEMSELVES TO GET THE FULL BENEFITS AND WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE REST OF THE THAT THE POWER HOW WE GET A RAT. HOW WE GET ABOUT THE IF WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU IN SENATOR THANK YOU FOR COMMITTING TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE? THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FEES AND SO FORTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF THIS AS OF THE RECOMMENDATION OF SUPPORT FROM THE CHAIR. THERE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS LET'S SEPARATE WAS OUR MOTION AND SECOND I THINK THERE WAS. ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE. DALY BY DALY AYE MAYES. AYE MAYES AYE BIGELOW. BIGELOW AYE CABALLERO CALDERON. GEN. CHEN AYE CHIU AYE CHU AYE COOLEY. COOLEY AYE COOPER AYE COOPER AYE FRAZIER. FRAZIER AYE GIPSON. GRAYSON AYE GRAYSON AYE HARPER ZERO BILL PASSES THINK IS RIGHT YOU SENATOR. MR DOT I THINK KEY YOUR EUROPE. WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. LAST FALL LIFE FOR RESIDENTS OF MY DISTRICT IN CENTER MAGUIRE'S DISTRICT CHANGED FOREVER. WHEN THE FIRES RIPPED THROUGH THE NORTH DAY? AS GOVERNOR BROWN SAID THIS IS TRULY ONE OF THE GREATEST IF NOT THE GREATEST TRAGEDY. THE CALIFORNIANS HAD EVER FACED. THE FIRE LEFT A PATH OF DESTRUCTION IN ITS WAKE IN THE NUMBERS ARE TRULY STAGGERING. OVER THREE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES BURNED OVER FORTY FOUR PEOPLE DEAD. NEARLY NINE THOUSAND STRUCTURES DESTROYED IT LOSSES. TALKING AYE THIS POINT MORE THAN TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS. WHAT IF IT'S OF THIS MAGNITUDE OCCURRED THE STATE HAS A MORAL IMPERATIVE TO ACT IN THIS BODY HAS A MORAL IMPERATIVE TO ACT? AND AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AFFECTED AREA -- CENTER MCGUIRE AND I HAVE A MORAL IMPERATIVE TO ACT. S. B. EIGHT NINETY FOUR GUARANTEES UP TO THREE YEARS OF COVERAGE FOR LIVING EXPENSES. IT DOESN'T INCREASE THE THE ABOUT BUT THREE YEARS OF LIVING EXPENSES ASSURES THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES PROVIDE VICTIMS WITH POLICY RENEWALS FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS FOLLOWING A DISASTER. REQUIRES COMPANIES TO REPORT. TO TO THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IF A NON RENEW OR PULL OUT OF A MARKET. IT WILL BE TELL IT. THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN IN THE SENATE -- DID THE MEMBERS ORTEGA IT LIMITS RETROACTIVELY RETRO ACTIVITY. TO JUST THE POLICY RENEWAL PORTION OF THE BILL. AND THIS IS A HUGE HIT TO MY CONSTITUENTS WHO WON'T BE PROTECTED BY THE MANY PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN PAYING THEIR POLICY PREMIUMS. FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS OF THAT DECADES AND DECADES. AND ANOTHER -- RIGHT AMENDMENT TAKEN INSTEAD OF ALLOWING IT SHIRTS TO COMBINE COVERAGE A. B. AND C. TO COVER THE COSTS OF REBUILDING. AFTER NATURAL DISASTER -- WOULD BE LOOKED AT WITH THE TOTAL LOSS THE BILL IS. LIMITED TO COMBINE CLAIMS FOR PROVEN LOSSES IN COVERAGE BEING COVERAGE SEE. AND USE THOSE FUNDS TO REPLACE IF THEY DO NOT HAVE AN ENOUGH PRIMARY COVERAGE COVERAGE A INSURANCE COVERAGE. NOW THESE AMENDMENTS NARROWED THIS BILL INCREDIBLY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE COMBINATION OF THE COVERAGE PROVISION. ONLY APPLIES WITH THERE'S THREE CONDITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MET DECLARED DISASTER. A TOTAL LOSS HE AM INSUFFICIENT COVERAGE IN THEIR PRIMARY DWELLING COVERAGE TO COVER THE COST OF REBUILDING. NOW I UNDERSTAND THIS COMMITTEE IS ASKING YOU TO TAKE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS. EVEN THOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO REMOVE THE RETROACTIVITY IN THIS BILL. I THINK BENEFITING EVERYONE IN THE STATE GOING FORWARD IS TOO IMPORTANT TO LET. THAT PREVENT THIS BILL FROM MOVING FORWARD. I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT ALL THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. EXCEPT FOR I DO NOT WANT TO REMOVE CONTENTS. FROM SECTION. THREE I DON'T WANT TO REMOVE CONTENTS FROM SECTION THREE OF THE BILL OR CREATE A NEW SUBDIVISION BE. IN SECTION THREE OF THE BILL. SO THOSE OF THAT ONLY TWO AMENDMENTS THAT -- I I DO WHAT DO NOT WANT TO TAKE TODAY [inaudible] REGARDING CONTENTS. LET ME BE CLEAR. WE'RE NOT ASKING INSURERS. TO PAY MORE MONEY. BUT RATHER ALLOW PEOPLE FLEXIBILITY IN USING THE MONEY FOR THEIR ACTUAL LOSSES TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES [inaudible] SO AGAIN [inaudible] WE'RE WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR FLEXIBILITY WE'RE NOT ASKING THE INSURERS TO PAY OUT ONE DOLLAR MORE THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE PAID OUT. FOR THE POLICIES. REGARDING 30% OF COVERAGE A IN MY VIEW AND IN THE CHURCH COMMISSIONERS VIEW AND MANY OTHER SENATE MCGUIRE WHO HAD A BILL ON THIS AREA. THIS ENDS UP BEING THE LAST. THEN MOST OF WHAT THE INDUSTRY DID FOLLOWING THE FIRES OF MY DISTRICT LAST YEAR. MANY COMPANIES GAVE 75% OF COVERED SEE IT COVERED SEE IS OFTEN 50%. OF COVERAGE A WE BELIEVE THIS WITH GIVING. A LOWER PERCENTAGE THAN THEY WOULD WITHOUT THE VERY LEGISLATION. THAT WE ARE PROPOSING TODAY. SO WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY WITNESS WITNESSES THANK YOU. MR PEROT -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS GOOD MORNING ROBERT HERALDICALLY COMMISSIONER FOR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE I'M JOINED TODAY BY A CHIEF DEPUTY GILL LAUCH HER. ARM IT WE'VE FIRST OF ALL WE WHICH IS LIKE TO PROFUSELY THANK SENATOR DODD CENTER MCGUIRE AND THE OTHER MEMBERS PROJECT OF THE NORTH BE DELEGATION -- WHO HAVE WORKED IN A COORDINATED FASHION WITH THE DEPARTMENT -- THAT AFTER UNPRECEDENTED LOSSES -- SOME OF YOUR DISTRICTS ARE ABLAZE AGAIN AS WE SPEAK -- AND IF YOUR DISTRICT IS NOT ON FIRE PROBABLY ONE OF YOUR NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS IS ON FIRE. THE FIRE SEASON STARTED ALREADY LAST WEEK LAKE COUNTY. HAS BEEN HIT YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN EVACUATED. WHO ARE STILL LIVING IN SHELTERS RIGHT NOW HOPING AND PRAYING THAT THEIR HOMES DON'T BURN DOWN? THE FIRE SURVIVORS COLLECTIVELY NEED YOUR HELP. THIS BILL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED ON THE SENATE FLOOR. THE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS AS THE SENATOR DISCUSSED [inaudible] WOULD BE.% RESULT IN A SITUATION THAT IS FAR WEAKER THAN CURRENT PRACTICE. EIGHTY ONE POINT 3%. OF THE TOTAL LOSSES FROM LAST YEAR'S DEVASTATING FIRES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WERE WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT OFFERED. AT LEAST 75% OF CONTENTS COVERAGE OR MORE WITHOUT MAKING. THE HOMEOWNERS THE SURVIVORS GO THROUGH THE PAINFUL WHAT SENATOR MCGUIRE HAS DESCRIBED AS A PTSD TYPE OF EVENT. PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH AN ITEMIZED INVENTORY TO COUNT FOR EVERY STOCK AND EVERY TOY AND EVERY SPOON AND EVERYPLACE. THAT YOU HAD IN YOUR HOME THEIR WERE PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP AT THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE WITH BOXES. WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THAT TASK FOR MONTHS? AND MANY OF THEM SAID THEY WERE BARELY HALFWAY THROUGH. SO WE ARE HAPPY TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION BUT WE WOULD URGE YOU TO PASS AS STRONG A BILL AS POSSIBLE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND ATTEMPT TO SEND A LIFELINE TO THE SURVIVORS WHO ARE SO DESPERATELY ASKING FOR IT WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT [inaudible] OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALL THIS EVIDENCE AND ALLOWED HER. MISTER CHAIR TOWLE CHIEF DEPUTY OF THE DEPARTMENT. I DID NOT MEET -- SENATOR DODD HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I MET HIM AT MULTIPLE. EVENTS THAT WERE INTENDED TO HELP. CLAIMANTS FROM THE WILDFIRES WHERE HE WAS WORKING WITH HIS CONSTITUENTS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY NEEDED AND WHAT HE COULD DO TO HELP. WITH THAT'S AYE ECHO OF THEIR APPRECIATION TO SENATOR DODD FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND FOR ALL THE WORK HE DID DIRECTLY WITH THIS CONSTITUENTS. IT WAS -- THESE EVENTS TO BRING OUT THE BEST IN PEOPLE AND HERE TO SAVE -- SO MUCH FOR NOT ONLY FIRST REESE BUT FOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AT EVERY LEVEL. CITY OFFICIALS BUT COUNTY OFFICIALS AND STAFF. I'M HOPE I'M VERY HOPEFUL WILL WERE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL. BUT AS WAS EXPRESSED. AS ALREADY AMENDED THIS BILL WOULD NOT COST AND SUGARS ANYMORE IN CLAIMS PAYMENT THAN THEY ALREADY WOULD BE OBLIGED TO PAY. UNDER A STANDARD POLICY. ALSO DOES AS SENATOR DODD SAID IS GIVE FLEXIBILITY. AND ANOTHER BENEFIT OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL. IS THAT THERE IS TYPICALLY A LOT OF DEBATE OVER WHO BECAUSE THE UNDER INSURANCE. THIS KIND OF PUT THAT ASIDE. AND LETS PEOPLE HOPEFULLY DEAL WITH THE UNDER INSURANCE ISSUE. WITHOUT ARGUING OF HOW DID THEY BECOME UNDER INSURED IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS THAT THE INSURERS FAULT OR WAS THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY. I I WOULD ASK ALL OF YOU ARE YOU COMPLETELY AWARE OF HOW YOU CAME TO HAVE THE POLICY LIMITS YOU HAVE ON YOUR OWN HOMEOWNERS POLICY. PEOPLE AREN'T REALLY. COMPLETELY AWARE OF HOW THOSE LIMITS GET OF WHERE THEY ARE. AND WHEN THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE. THEY NEED HELP AND THEY'D SOMETIMES A FREQUENTLY FIRST THING ONE DOES IS BLOWING THE INSURER THIS LOOKS FOR ANOTHER SOLUTION. ALLOWING PEOPLE TO PUT SOME OF THEIR OTHER LIMITS TOWARDS THAT UNDER INSURANCE PROBLEM. WITHOUT THE LITIGATION OVER HOW THEY GOT TO BE UNDER INSURED IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT SERVES AN EVEN LARGER PURPOSE THANK YOU. OTHER OTHER PERSONS HERE WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. THINKING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MARK OPEN DEL HERE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTIES OF NAFTA MENACE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A IN SUPPORT. THE EMBARRASSED ON BEHALF OF THE FIFTY ONE EMPLOYEES OF MEDTRONIC WHO LOST THEIR HOMES DUE TO THIS DEVASTATING WILDFIRE WE JUST WANT TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR THE BILL AND THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AARON EVANS ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DAVID JONES LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA ENDS RESIDENTS THANK YOU. OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. AGAINST THE BILL. THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU. I WANT. TO I WANT TO ESTABLISH SOMETHING BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF CONFUSION HAS BEEN CREATED. FOR INSTANCE AN OFF SITE THE MEDTRONIC. EMPLOYEES. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL. THAT WOULD HELP [inaudible] THOSE EMPLOYEES. WHO SUFFERED FROM? A PAST INCIDENT. THIS IS ABOUT GOING FORWARD. THIS IS ABOUT COVERAGE GOING FORWARD I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT. BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION ABOUT THAT. IT'S GOING FORWARD SIR RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU. UP PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. CARA CROSS BUT THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA TOGETHER ARE SIX MEMBER COMPANIES RIGHT THE MAJORITY OF THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICIES IN THE STATE. ON GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU -- FOR HAVING ME HERE -- AT THE COMMITTEE KNOWS THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS WORKED DILIGENTLY TO COMMIT TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS AND TO REACH A CONSENSUS ON A GREAT NUMBER OF BILLS A SESSION. RESPONDING RESPONDING TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES. WELL WE HAVE TRIED VERY HARD TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR S. B. NINETY FOUR AS WELL UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS JUNCTURE WE MUST CONTINUE TO OPPOSE LESS AMENDED SB -- EIGHT NINETY FOUR SP NINETY FOUR ACTUALLY HARM CONSUMERS BY REDUCING THEIR CHOICE OF INSURANCE PRODUCTION SHOULD THEY SUFFER A LOSS TO THEIR HOME. THE BILL THREATENS CONTENTS COVERAGE AVAILABLE TO HOMEOWNERS AS WELL AS IN THE CENTRAL LIVING EXPENSE COVERAGE KNOWN AS ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSE COVERAGE OR A ONLY. REGARDING THE CONTENT. U. S. B. ID FOUR WOULD FORCE THE COMBINATION OF COVERAGES BY COMBINING APPLES AND ORANGES. THIS OF THE FLAWED ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS INSUFFICIENT TROUBLING COVERAGE THAT COULD HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF ACTUALLY RESULTING UNDER INSURANCE. FURTHER IF DIFFERENT COVERED FURTHER IF INSURANCE CANNOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THEIR ACTUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE FOR DIFFERENT COVERAGES. IT WILL EITHER BE FORCED INCREASE PREMIUMS OR NOT OFFER MORE GENEROUS COVERAGE. THIS WILL IMPACT ALL CALIFORNIANS HOMEOWNERS. WE HAVE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE COMBINATION OF COVERAGE A AND B. THIS THE BIG CONCESSION ON THE INDUSTRY PUTS PART. BUT INSTEAD OF AWKWARD IT WOULD INSTEAD OF AWKWARDLY FORCING COMBINATION OF CONTENTS COVERAGE WOULD PROVIDE HOMEOWNERS A PERCENTAGE OF CONTENTS COVERAGE WITHOUT PROVIDING AN INVENTORY. SO I KNOW THAT MR HER RAIL HAS SPOKEN TO THE INVENTORY ISSUE AND RIGHT NOW IT THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS INVENTORY OUR PROPOSAL ALSO WOULD MAKE IT MUCH SIMPLER PROCESS. IN THAT -- IN THAT HOMEOWNERS COULD SUBMIT OF THEIR CONTENTS COVERAGE PUT OUT INVENTORY THAT CONTENTS -- COVERAGE OF 25% COULD BE USED IN ANY WAY. SO I'M BUT UNFORTUNATELY THESE AMENDMENTS NOT BEEN ACCEPTED. I ALSO -- WANNA GO INTO ANOTHER ISSUE THAT HAS NOT BEEN DISCUSSED THIS MUCH AND THAT'S THE DIVISIONAL LIVING EXPENSE ISSUE. I WANT TO STRONGLY EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT JEOPARDIZING THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SAFETY NET FOR HOMEOWNERS IN THE EVENT THAT THEY LOSE THEIR HOME. HOMEOWNERS ARE MOST AFRAID AND DESPONDENT WHEN THEY INITIALLY LOSE THEIR HOME AND NEED A PLACE TO LIVE. DALY IS A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO HELP HOMEOWNERS GET BACK ON THEIR FEET BY PROVIDING FUNDS FOR HOUSING FURNISHING AND OTHER LIVING EXPENSES SPEAK OUT THEY TRY TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES AND THEIR LIVES. IN ITS CURRENT FORM SB EIGHT NINETY FOUR OVER SO RESULT IN HOMEOWNERS LOSING THEIR ABILITY TO OBTAIN MORE GENEROUS ALIE BENEFITS. MANY COMPANIES OFFER A ONLY POLICIES THAT HAVE NO DOLLAR LIMITS SO THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN KEEP THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING. THIS IS A HUGE BENEFIT THAT WILL NO LONGER BE OFFERED BY MANY COMPANIES THEY CANNOT COLLECT PREMIUM FOR IT. S. B. NINETY FOUR COULD TRIPLE PAYOUTS FOR DAILY POLICIES WITHOUT DOLLAR LIMITS. COMPANIES DO NOT COLLECT PREMIUM FOR THIS THE IMPACT WILL BE THE COMPANIES WILL STOP OFFERING THIS COVERAGE. THE INDUSTRY'S AGREED IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY TO EXTEND A ONLY COVERAGE UP TO THIRTY SIX MONTHS FOR A ONLY POLICIES WITH DOLLAR LIMITS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MR DOGS AS UNDERDOGS ASK OR HOWEVER APPLIANCE EXTENSION TO POLICIES WITH OUT DOLLAR LIMITS MAKES NO SENSE AND WILL RESULT IN HOMEOWNERS LOSING THIS IMPORTANT BENEFIT THAT ALLOWS FROM SOME NORMALCY IN THEM. IN THEIR LIVES FOR THESE REASONS THAT I'VE DISCUSSED WE ASK YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THE OTHER PERSONS IN OPPOSITION. THE CHAIRMAN OUR MONTHLY CHANNEL BICU HAVE A PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS HOA THANK SENATOR DODD AND STAFF. AND THE COMMITTEE I THINK WHAT I HEARD IS THAT THE RETROS COMING OUT AND IF IT IS THEN THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY FROM MY ORGANIZATION. WAS I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER AMENDMENTS ARE BEING CONSIDERED THIS POINT BUT I SAW ME ASSURE YOU THAT. I WE APPRECIATE THE RETRO COMING UP THANK YOU. CATHERINE PAY BUT AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO THE WORK THAT THEY ARE AUTHOR HAS DONE ON IT -- SIMILAR CONCERNS TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM A PERSONAL SHIRTS FEDERATION MENTIONED -- AND JUST AS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS -- SO INSURERS HAVE PREVIOUSLY DONE NEXT RELATED CLAIMS HANDLING WHICH WITH 25% OF C. NOT SOMETHING MANY ADOPTED INTO THE AMENDMENT THAT -- INSURERS HAVE OFFERED IS 25% OF A WHICH IS ACTUALLY SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT AND IT DOES ST OPERATED HOMEOWNERS SIMILARLY INSTEAD OF DIFFERENT AND DEPENDING ON DIFFERENT WHAT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF A COVERAGE SEARS. AND FINALLY I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT -- WE CERTAINLY A MEMBERS HAVE SYMPATHY TO THE NOTION OF HAVING -- ALL YOUR DIFFERENT COVERAGES BE USED FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT THERE ARE POLICIES THAT ARE OUT THERE AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE ON THE PEOPLE ALSO MAKE THOSE CHOICES AND THEY ARE EXPENSIVE. SO WITH THOSE AYE WE WOULD ECHO PIPS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER PERSONS PLEASE GOOD MORNING SHERRY MCKEE REPRESENT THE PACIFIC ASSOCIATION DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANIES WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR FOR WORKING WITH US FOR THE MOMENT THEY HAVE TAKEN -- IF WHEN THE RETRO I'M ACTIVITY LANGUAGE COMES OUT AND WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE BILL AND HOPE TREATMENT PROPOSITION IF POSSIBLE THANK YOU. MARIA GARCIA BEHALF A STATE FARM INSURANCE ALSO REGRETTABLY STILL UP AMENDED AND AT GRATEFUL TO THE AUTHOR TO WHERE HE'S BEEN SO FAR BUT FOR THE REASON SAID MISS CROSS ARTICULATED PACIFIC LEAD TO THE ALLEY PROVISIONS WITHOUT THE DOLLAR LIMITS. AND AND THEN THE COMBINATION OF CONTENTS COVERAGE. GERMAN MEMBERS JOHN NOR WOULD I BE HEALTH OF LIBERTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY I JUST WANT WAY IN BRIEFLY ON THE ALE ISSUE NO PROBLEMS EXTENDING. ELLIE FROM TWO YEARS THREE YEARS FOR POLICIES THAT HAVE A CAP ON WHAT DOLLAR CAP BUT LIVERIES POLICIES DON'T HAVE A DOLLAR CAP IS THIS BILL WOULD RESULT IN. THAT PROCESS A 50% INCREASE DALY PAYMENTS -- SO I SUSPECT THE REACTION OF MANY JURORS WOULD BE -- TO IS TO CAPS ON THEIR A ONLY A IN RESPONSES. SO MY WILL THAT IS POSITIVE FOR CONSUMERS. SO FOR THE FOR THOSE REASONS WERE CONCERNED MAKE IT. MANY OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. A I'M GONNA ASK YOUR THE COMMITTEE. A CONSULTANT COMMITTEE STAFF TO SUMMARIZE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'M [inaudible] WE REALLY THERE'S NOT NUMEROUS% AMENDMENTS THAT AS AN AMENDMENT TO STRIKE THE RETROACTIVITY PROVISION I'M. NOT A HOW TO PRESENT CLEAR OF THE AUTHORS ALREADY ACCEPTED OR NOT BUT WOOD TO MOVE ON THERE'S A COUPLE OF FAIRLY TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS BUT REALLY -- IT AT AT THE POLICY LEVEL THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE AMENDMENTS DAD THE COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED. THE BILL'S PRIMARY GOAL ASIDE FROM A COUPLE OF ANCILLARY PROVISIONS. IS TO ALLOW A POLICY HOLDER TO USE THE VALUE OF OTHER STRUCTURES AND CONTENTS COVERAGES THAT NORMALLY. IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR REBUILDING THE HOME. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE POLICY. THE BILL PROPOSES TO DO THAT BY SIMPLY SAYING THE INSURANCE COMPANY PASSED THE RIGHT THE VALUE OF THOSE COVERAGES WITHOUT COMPLYING WITH THE POLICY COME PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE REPLACEMENT. AND JUST GIVE CASH MONEY. THAT CREATES A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS FOR THE INSURERS SO. THE AMENDMENT THAT'S BEING PROPOSED IS DESIGNED TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING. WITH A DIFFERENT METHOD. BEEN DIFFERENT MATH DID IS THAT A FORMULA. IN DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE FORMULA IS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL SORTS OF FORMULAS WE PROPOSED A FORMULA. BASED ON 30% OF COVERAGE SEE. SO APPROXIMATING AMOUNT UP MOST POLICY HOLDERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CLAIM. AND THEY WOULD GET THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO APPLY TO THEIR UNDER INSURANCE IN COVERAGE A A AS MR LOUNGER DESCRIBED WE'RE NOT GONNA GET INTO THE DEBATE ABOUT WHY THEY'RE UNINSURED MOSTLY THE DEMAND SEARCH MAYBE. BUT WHAT. THE AMENDMENT PROPOSES A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY TO DO THE SAME THING -- AND IT IN ADDITION TO A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING. IT SOLVES THE PTS DE. INVENTORY ALL YOUR CONTENTS BOMB ISSUE THAT THE WITNESS IN THE SENATOR HAVE TALKED ABOUT. DID YOU GET THE EXACT SAME NUMBER OF DOLLARS AND CENTS SHIFTED FROM COVERAGE BNC OVER TO COVERAGE DAY. IT MAY NOT BUT IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THAT SAME PURPOSE -- AND ADDITIONALLY PROVIDING RELIEF FROM THE INVENTORY REQUIREMENTS. COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE THERE QUESTIONS OF WHO. ARM OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ANY QUESTIONS. ARE THEY CLEAR. I BELIEVE THEY ARE -- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. OF THE AUTHOR. AT THIS POINT. MISTER GIBSON MISTER GRAYSON. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M UNCLEAR IN TERMS OF WHAT OF THE INDUSTRY. HAS INDICATED. REGARDING WHAT'S IN JEOPARDY AROUND THE ALE <u>&lt;c.green&gt; BECAUSE I&lt;/c&gt;</u> HAPPEN TO KNOW THEY REALLY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT -- TO INDIVIDUALS WHO SUFFERS SOME KIND OF LOSS OF THEIR HOME. OF YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S HOMES ARE MOSTLY THEIR RETIREMENT IS WHAT THEY SEEK A LOT OF MONEY INTO AND TREASURE THE MOST. AND I KNOW THAT FOR ONE WHO HAS. HAS SUFFERED A SITUATION DALY VERY VERY HELPFUL [inaudible] AND I'M PRIZE THAT -- INDUSTRY WAS SAILED OPPOSITION WOULD SAY THAT. CAN YOU UNLESS YOU ARTICULATE. FOR ME WHAT WOULD BE IN JEOPARDY BECAUSE I HEARD CAPS ARE HEARD REMOVAL THEY'LL THE CAN YOU ARTICULATE THAT PIECE BECAUSE THAT'S VERY. CONCERNED BECAUSE THAT'S THE MONEY THAT HELPS PEOPLE CONTINUE TO LIVE WHILE THEIR HOUSE OR HOME IS BEING REBUILT AND THAT WHOLE. SITUATION SO CAN YOU ARTICULATE -- YOUR POINT AROUND ALIEN THAT I LIKE TO HEAR FROM. SENATOR DODD OR HIS WERE. SURE HAPPY. TO SO WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO IS A ONLY THAT DOES NOT HAVE A DOLLAR CAP. SO WITH THAT ADVANTAGE ABOUT IS IS THAT IT ALLOWS A HOMEOWNER WHO HAS LOST THEIR HOME TO HAVE OBTAINED THE SAME LIVING STANDARDS THEY CURRENTLY HAVE. IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THAT WOULD NECESSARILY HAPPEN WITH A DOLLAR LIMIT POLICY BUT IT DEFINITELY GIVES MUCH MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN. THE ABILITY TO HAVE YOUR SAME STANDARD OF LIVING IT'S A VERY GENEROUS POLICY AND IT'S OFFERED BY THE VAST MAJORITY OF PITS MEMBER COMPANIES [inaudible] IF THE IF THERE IS A LOT. I'M AN EXTENSION ON TIME THAT'S GOING TO EXTEND HOW MUCH THE COMPANIES ARE PAYING OUT UNLIMITED DOLLARS THEY'RE NOT PRICING FOR THAT RIGHT NOW. IF THEY'RE UNABLE TO PRICE FOR IT THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE REASSESSING WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GONNA OFFER THAT KIND OF A BENEFIT A VERY GOOD BENEFIT. TO HOMEOWNERS ABOUT THE HAVE SOME COMPANIES ARE ALREADY LOOKING AT WHETHER THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT KIND OF BENEFIT IF THIS BILL PASSES WAS NO MORE. PUTTING A CAP IT'S WHETHER THAT THEY DON'T EVEN OFFER IT. THAT PARTICULAR KIND OF A LAKE COVERAGE YES OKAY THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL IT WILL NEVER BE AVAILABLE THAT MISTER CHAIR IF I CAN JUST HAVE SENATOR. D'AMATO HEADLEY'S OR GO HAS REPRESENTATIVES I MAY JUST MAKE ONE POINT ALTERNATE. THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY THE QUESTIONS YOU ASKED. THAT THE COMMITTEE OR THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAS NOT CHANGED. CURRENT PROVISIONS OF THE A. L. E.. SO THAT'S HIM THAT'S IN THE BILL OBVIOUSLY THE OPPOSITION DOES NOT LIKE THAT RIGHT MISTER DODDS BILL EXPANDS [inaudible] AILEY COVERAGE [inaudible] GOING FORWARD. AND WHERE OR NOT AND WE'RE NOT I'M NOTSUGGESTING AN AMENDMENT TO THAT WE ARE ACCEPTING THAT PROVISION IN THIS BILL. RIGHT THE THE INDUSTRY HAS PROBLEMS WITH IT IN THE INDUSTRY IS SAYING DOWN THE ROAD. THEY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST POLICIES AND RATES. I'M TO ACCOMMODATE THAT BUT WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING ANY CHANGE TO MR DODD'S PROPOSAL. IN THAT REGARD. THEN UP LET ME ADD AGAIN DATA FIRST. SOME POLICIES DON'T HAVE LIMITS AS WAS DESCRIBED BUT THOSE POLICIES PAY UNTIL THE HOME IS HABITABLE AGAIN. SO THAT WAS ALREADY KIND OF INCLUDED IN THOSE POLICIES AS A PROVISION THAT EXTENDS COVERAGE IT DOES A GENEROUS EXTENSION. BUT IT IS PART OF HOW THE POLICIES. WORK NOW WHETHER IT WAS TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS SO THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THOSE POLICIES SECOND. THE ANSWERS AREN'T PAYING FOR ANYTHING THAT HASN'T. BEEN PAID FOR BY THEIR POLICY HOLDERS. SO ALL OF THESE PROVISIONS AREN'T SOMETHING THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE IN SHORT BURSTS MONEY IT'S COMING OUT OF PREMIUMS PAID BY POLICY HOLDERS. AND AS SENATOR DRAW SENATOR DODD MADE CLEAR THERE'S A TRIPLE TRIGGER TO WHEN ANYONE WOULD BE -- HAVE THE OPTION OF HAVING THESE BENEFITS RIGHT. THESE BENEFITS ONLY COME WHEN YOU HAVE SUFFERED THROUGH. A CATASTROPHE. YOU HAVE A TOTAL LOSS AND YOU'RE UNDER INSURED. THAT LIMITS HOW MUCH THE RATES ARE GOING THERE EVEN NEED TO BE ADJUSTED THIS IS A VERY LIMITED. POOL OF POLICY HOLDERS WHO ARE GONNA RECEIVE THIS BENEFIT BUT THOSE WHO NEED THEM MOST. I TELL YOU IS THE FORMER. CHIEF OF OUR RATE REGULATION BRANCH THE AFFECT ON PREMIUM WOULD BE MINIMAL. IT CERTAINLY CLARIFIES SO -- WHAT POLICY HOLDERS CAN EXPECT THOUGH OF [inaudible] MOVING FORWARD SHOULD THE BILL PASSED AN BE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR IT WILL GIVE IT WILL CLARIFY. THE SITUATION FOR POLICY HOLDERS. FROM OTHER QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER GRAYSON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE -- THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND FOR YOUR PASSION AS WELL AS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AND ARE YOU FOR FILLING THAT RESPONSE BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT I'M IN A ROOM WITH A LOT OF REALLY REALLY SMART PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES TO INSURANCE. AND BLESS ALL OF YOU -- IN MY IN MY VERY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE -- AND EXPOSURE TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AYE I'VE HEARD A STATEMENT THAT. THAT'S BOTHERSOME TO ME NOT FROM SENATOR -- SO MUCH BUT IT IS BOTHERSOME TO ME BECAUSE IT APPEARS LIKE FOLKS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY SMART THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY -- WE SHOULD KNOW OR YOU DO KNOW WHAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE APPROACHING THIS FROM. THE STATEMENT THAT A CONSUMER GETS ON THEIR INSURANCE POLICY WITH THAT ONE DOLLAR AMOUNT. THAT SAYS HERE'S HOW MUCH YOU'RE PAYING FOR ALL OF YOUR INSURANCE AND THAT'S HOW YOU'RE APPROACHING THIS BUT THAT'S NOT HOW INDUSTRY RUNS. INDUSTRY DOESN'T RUN BASED ON THAT ONE FIGURE THAT'S PUBLISHED TO THE THE CONSUMER INDUSTRY RAIMES BASED ON THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. OF INSURANCE IT'S BEING PROVIDED AS A PRODUCT AND THOSE CATEGORIES ARE RATED DIFFERENTLY SO WHEN YOU SAY WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PAY MORE. IN ESSENCE YOU KIND OF ARE BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T RATED ALL OF THOSE CATEGORIES AT THE SAME RATE. SO WHEN YOU'RE REQUIRING THEM TO PUT OUT -- MONEY OUT OF ONE RATE AND YOU SAY WELL IT'S DIRTY IT'S THREE YEARS THEY'VE PAID UP THIS MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE THIS MUCH COVERAGE FOR THREE YEARS THEY DIDN'T USE AT ALL SO LET'S TAKE THE LEFTOVER INPUTTED INTO ANOTHER PART. WELL THEY DIDN'T RATE THAT IT AND AND I'M MAYBE I AM TOTALLY. IN A POSITION TO BE -- TO BE CORRECTED HERE. SO -- IT AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME HOWEVER IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IN YOU CAN EDUCATE ME AND SCHOOL BUT TO HEAR TO KINGDOM COME TODAY. BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN THEY ARE DOING THAT RATES. THEY'RE NOT PLANNING ON REALLY PAYING FOR SOMEONE TO BE OFF SITE OR PUT ASIDE FOR THREE ENTIRE FOUR YEARS. THEY'RE TAKING A RATE AND THEY'RE RATING THAT AT HEY IT'S OUR IN OUR BEST INTEREST TO GET THESE PEOPLE BACK IN THEIR HOME THAT WE REBUILT FOR THEM AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. SO THIS IS A MODEL YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE PROTECTING THE CONSUMER AND I THINK THAT'S PHENOMENAL I THINK GETTING MONEY INTO THEIR HANDS AND AN ACTOR MONEY IS RIGHT. THIS WHOLE UNDERSHIRT ISSUE WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH. BUT YOUR YOU'RE TAKING MONEY FROM ONE CATEGORY THAT'S RATED IN ONE WAY AND PAYING AND I'LL IN ANOTHER WAY. AND THAT'S MESSING WITH I THINK THE MODEL [inaudible] OF INSURANCE DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOW AM I NOT SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT THE SENATORS I AM. VERY MUCH SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AT HERE'S WHAT I'M ASKING. FOR AND BY THE WAY THIS WHOLE UNDER SHIRT INTO THE I'M A LITTLE PREACHY MOTOR -- THIS WHOLE UNDER INSURED ISSUE THAT WE HAVE ISN'T. AND I'M NOT SAYING THE SENATORS DOING THIS BUT GOING AFTER ONE INDUSTRY TO TRY TO FIX THAT PROBLEM ISN'T IS IS NOT THE ANSWER NOR HAVE YOU EVER SAID IT IS. BUT IT'S IT'S WHEN YOU HAVE A CRISIS OR AN EMERGENCY OR TRAGEDY LIKE WE'VE HAD. AND YOU HAVE CONTRACTORS. THE TIMES THE AMOUNT OR YOU HAVE PRODUCT THAT IS INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY IN PRICE -- THOSE THINGS HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH AS WELL GOING BACK TO THIS MY ASK TO THE SENATOR IS WOULD YOU BE WILLING. IF THIS BILL WAS TO GET OUT TODAY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION. TRY TO FIND SOME HAPPY MEDIUM. MAYBE NOT SO HAPPY SOME MEDIUM -- WHERE AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID WITH ANOTHER BILL TODAY WHERE NOBODY'S HAPPY BUT WE GOT TO THE RIGHT PLACE WHO WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO BE -- COMMIT TO JUST CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND THAT'S TO GET MONEY INTO THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE TO GET THEM BACK TO THE STATE THEY WERE IN BEFORE THE TRAGEDY. AND AND DO THAT PRIOR TO REACHING THE FLOOR. I DID THE ANSWER THE QUESTION IS YES PARTICULARLY -- I HAVEN'T BEEN SO THRILLED WITH THE CONSULTANTS AMENDMENTS ON THIS BIT HIS COULD THE THOSE AMENDMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR US. A FORUM -- FOR NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS THAT. WE YOU KNOW WE DID NOT HAVE BEFORE SO -- SO THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS YES. IN AS MR GRAYSON SAID -- THE INDUSTRY DOESN'T LIKE SOME PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WHICH I THINK ARE REASONABLE AND FAIR. MR DOT DOESN'T LIKE SOME OF THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- AND THAT IS -- THE BILL EMERGED -- UNCERTAIN FASHION FROM THE SENATE. AND ANOTHER BILL THAT HAD SOME SIMILAR HAD TO ADDRESS THE SAME ISSUES. A COMPLETELY FAILED. IN THE SENATE AND THE VERY CHALLENGING. OF ARRAY OF ISSUES HERE BUT I THINK THIS IS THE BEST WE'RE GONNA DO. AS OF TODAY. AND CERTAINLY I ENCOURAGE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS TO TRY. TO TRIED TO GO SOME. MAKE MORE FOLKS HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME [inaudible] BUT US -- MISTER FRAZIER HAS QUESTION. SO IT'S KIND OF A TWOFOLD QUESTION I THINK OF SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAVEN'T ACKNOWLEDGED TODAY IS. THAT ONE A ONE OF A HOMEOWNER IS VICTIMIZED BY A NATURAL DISASTER. AND OTHER DISPLACED. NOBODY IS AN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY SOUGHT TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE. THERE MORTGAGE DOES NOT GO AWAY. AND SO THERE DISPLACED. AND THEY'RE HAVING TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE. AND I THINK THAT WHAT. DOES INSURANCE CENTRICITY OR IS IT THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY THAT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MORTGAGE INSURANCE. THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY BUILDING OKAY. AND THE OTHER THING IS IS WHAT I LOOK AT INDUSTRY WE LOOK AT PROP ONE OF THREE WE LOOK AT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES. AS FAR AS MANDATES. BUT PAIN FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE THE COMMISSION. OR THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE CAN ACTUALLY NOT. PROVE A RATE INCREASE. OF DO TO A MANDATE. ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THAT'S A REALLY BIG CONCERN FOR US ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE ARE PRICE ADEQUATE. ON EARTH ADEQUATE PREMIUMS ON IN GENERAL SO TO PUT MORE PRESSURE. ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO PAY OUT MORE WITHOUT BEING ABLE -- TO COLLECT ADEQUATE PREMIUMS AS A BIG ISSUE AND THAT'S AGAIN WHY -- THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE MAY NOT BE THE ABILITY TO OFFER THE SAME KIND OF PRODUCTS. GENEROUS PRODUCTS THAT WE OFFER TODAY. I HAVE TWO A DISPUTE THAT I I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE YOUR YOUR PREMIUMS IN THE DEPARTMENT APPROVES A PREMIUM LEVEL. THAT WOULD ALLOW AN INSURER TO PAY ALL OF ITS COVERED LOSSES. THAT'S HOW RATE THE RATE PROCESS WORKS. SO IF INSURERS LOSSES FROM. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WERE GREATER THAN THEY PREDICTED THE LOSSES FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WOULD BE AND THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA HAVE SIMILAR LOSSES IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OR THEY'VE AMENDED THEIR COVERAGE IN RESPONSE TO LEGISLATION TO GIVE BROADER COVERAGE THEY WOULD FILED NEW RATES. SO TO ABSORB WHATEVER ADDITIONAL LOSSES THEY WOULD EXPECT TO INCUR IN THE FUTURE. OKAY AND THANK YOU SO MISTER FRAZIER DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE BECAUSE YOU NEED YOU KNOW RECORD QUESTIONS TO THE INDUSTRY ARE RATTLING INDUSTRY THANK THANK YOU -- THANK YOU AND I WILL SAY THAT. AS MANDATED BY OR OVERSEEN BY DEPARTMENT INSURANCE. I THINK THAT WE TO GET HEAVY HANDED WITHOUT THE ABILITY FOR FOR ENTITY. FOR A COMPANY OR BUSINESS TO BE ABLE. TO TO OVERCOME IN AND SPREAD TO SPREAD THE PAIN. IN OTHER WORDS -- AND THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING IS. IS THERE A RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAN BE MADE. WITH AN EXPECTATION THAT. THEY CAN CONTINUE TO THRIVE IN THIS INDUSTRY. IF IF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE DECIDED NO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RECOVER. OR NOT AND IT'S HAPPENED MATTER FACT. THEY'VE BEEN REDUCED. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE START LOOKING AT MANDATES -- ON AN INDUSTRY THAT HAD. COULD BE HEART OF THROUGH ANOTHER ENTITY. DE M. ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS SIR MR GIPSON [inaudible] SO. THAT THING THAT THE CONVERSATION IN THE BACK OF AND MEN'S THAT WAS SUCH THAT WAS THAT'S BEFORE US AS A COMMITTEE -- AND WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT SENATOR DODD IS GOING TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY TO AGAIN TO GET TO A HAPPY MEDIUM SO THAT'S MY MOST. IS THERE IT IS THERE A SECOND TO THE MOTION. THANK YOU OF COMMITTEE STAFF WOULD LIKE TO JUST COULD BE CLEAR THE MOTION BY MISTER ANY AMENDMENTS THAT ARE ARE REFLECTED ON THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS EMBODIED IN -- THE MOCKUP THAT'S BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO THE MEMBERS THAT IS CORRECT AND THAT YOU ARTICULATED EARLIER FOR THE BODY. ARE THE QUESTIONS MISTER BIGELOW MANY. WHAT THINK YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S THE BILL WITH WHAT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS? TO BILL WHAT THE COMMITTEES. TO THE MOTION IS TO ADOPT. THE COMMITTEE SET OF MENDMENTS INTO THE BILL [inaudible] STEP [inaudible] ONE THERE'S THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION THAT'S A GOOD CLARIFICATION. ARE WE CLEAR. WE'RE INCORPORATING THE AMENDMENTS INTO THE BILL THIS MOTION. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS PEOPLE DOING ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] MR DOT. YEAH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE SEVEN MEMBER I'D APPRECIATE IS -- TRYING TO MOVE THIS UP THE ALL ALONG IN A GET UP. A POSITIVE RESPONSE THE REALITY IS IT'S YOUR VOTE. YOU PASS THESE AMENDMENTS AUTOMATICALLY. THERE IS NO. INCENTIVE FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO NEGOTIATE ANYTHING. LET ME BE CLEAR FROM DAY ONE I HAD BUT FRANKLY IN IN LOOKING BACK I'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT. INSURANCE AS WELL IN FROM DAY ONE IN THE SENATE I BELIEVE WE WERE DOING -- YELP. PROBABLY OVER WE DON'T. DOING THINGS THAT WOULD REALLY CREATE RATE PRESSURES RATE TENSIONS WHICH WOULD IMPACT EVERYBODY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT JUST THE VICTIMS. IT'S I WANT I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT -- THAT I I REALLY DON'T THINK THESE AMENDMENTS EARLY OUT ALL THE AMEND ITS EXCEPT FOR ONE OH THREE ONE A ONE POINT. OH THREE POINT SEVEN OR LET'S SAY SECTION. THREE I'M OKAY WITH THAT THAT SECTION THERE'S YOU GIVE THAT TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. THEY GOT NO REASON A NEGOTIATE WITH ME THEY JUST. ONE YEAH I KNOW THAT THEY JUST WON THE WAR AND ESSENTIALLY WHEN PEOPLE SAY I'D APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO IT FOR YOUR DISTRICT. YEAH MY DISTRICT IS DONE THIS BILL DOES NOTHING. FOR ANYBODY IN MY DISTRICT IT'S ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS MOVING FORWARD THAT YELLED THAT THAT THAT I'M REALLY LOOKING OUT. FOR AND AGAIN. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ISSUE OF THAT IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP RELATIVE -- TO ES EL WE NOTHING ELSE AND IT WHICH YOUR CONSULTANT IN YOUR CHAIRMAN. APPARENTLY HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH. THEY THE ISSUE THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY IS JUST COMBINING OF COVERAGES IT SEEMS TO ME. AYE ELISE FROM THE STEPS STEPS THEY ARE POOR COMMITTEE STANDPOINT. AND IN THAT REGARD. I AM NOT ASKING THIS BILL DOES NOT ASK THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. TO PAY ANYTHING MORE THAN ESTABLISH LOSSES INSTEAD OF PAYING FOR A REFRIGERATOR AND HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY A REFRIGERATOR THESE PEOPLE WANT. TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR [inaudible] NO. ALRIGHT OTHER OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- I MEAN WE'RE UP AGAINST A DEADLINE [inaudible] AND THAT IS WHAT IT IS SO YOUR ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE INSURANCE NDUSTRY ARE. ARE EITHER GOING TO OCCUR OR THEY'RE NOT -- AN IF YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT. THAT THAT THESE AMENDMENTS SOMEHOW RESTRICT THAT. TOM. I DON'T. NO THE THAT'S I'M NOT SURE I SHARE THAT OPINION.
