WE'RE LOOKING FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO COME AND VISIT WITH US -- SENATOR BORDERS SENATOR CHIANG CENTER DORADO SENATOR STERN SENATOR WINNER. IF YOU WITHIN EARSHOT OF MY VOICE WE WOULD WELCOME. YOUR PRESENCE THANKS WE CALLED [inaudible] YEAH. DO YOU HAVE -- SELF ALL RIGHT ARM SIR CHIANG WE HAVE CENTER CHIANG WITH SENATOR. FORGES HERE SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND KICK OFF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE GROWING IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN. CALIFORNIA -- WE'RE STILL WAITING SEVERAL OTHER SENATORS BUT I THINK AS MANY OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE KNOW. OF WE MULTIPLE. ASK HERE OF SOME OF US ARE. DOUBLE TASKING S IS A TRIPLE TESTING MAYBE EVEN QUADRUPLE TASKING. SO. LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET SOARED MORNING EVERYBODY THANK YOU FOR COMING THE FIRST HEARING OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE GROWING IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN CALIFORNIA. OTHERS FIRST HEARING IS JUST GOING TO BE AN INDUCTION INTO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE POLICY ISSUES. WE'RE GOING TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE ON A LOT OF ISSUES BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A HUGE SCOPE OF ISSUES -- I WANT TO THANK THE FOLKS WERE WATCHING ONLINE AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE A I FEEL THAT REACHED OUT TO OUR OFFICE WE'VE GOTTEN QUITE A NUMBER OF ENQUIRIES -- WE'VE HEARD FROM. YOU O A WIDE VARIETY OF ISSUES EVERYTHING FROM AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY. TO A AYE BIAS TO WORK FORCE CONCERNS AND PRIVACY ISSUES ALL OF THEM ARE IMPORTANT. UP. WE ARE WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO INCLUDE EVERYONE IN EVERY TOPIC CERTAINLY IN THIS HEARING -- BUT I DO APPRECIATE FOLKS. PROVIDING THEIR CONTRIBUTION OF BOTH -- IN WRITING AND BY EMAIL BY LETTER BY EMAIL AND ON THE PHONE -- IF I TIME ALLOWS AND I THINK IT WILL WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE YOU IN THE AUDIENCE TO COME UP AND GIVE US YOUR THOUGHTS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND WHEN WHERE THE COMMITTEE. OF MAKEOVER SHOULD GO -- WE'RE LIVING IN AN EXCITING TIME -- WITH CUTTING EDGE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY BEING DEVELOPED AND RELEASED EVERY DAY. I THINK I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE HERE WHEN I SAY WE NEED TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN GOVERNMENT. AS A AYE. BASICALLY TAKES OFF. THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE A HEARING LIKE THIS SO WE CAN HEAR FOR FOLKS ARE DOING THE RESEARCH WORK IN THE A. I. FIELD. I WE'VE GOT FOLKS HERE FROM THE ALCHEMY TESTIFYING TODAY AND WE'RE STARTING WITH. ONE OF MY FORMER COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLY MEMBER PEDRO NAVA WHO'S PRESENTING ON A LITTLE HAVE HOOVER COMMISSION REPORT -- WHICH IS AVAILABLE IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM. ASSEMBLYMEMBER NAVA. CONSECUTIVE TERMS CHAIR LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION HE'S A FORMER CIVIL LITIGATOR -- DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY MEMBER THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON CATASTROPHIC WHILE FAR COST RECOVERY IN AS I RECALL ALSO MEMBER THE COASTAL COMMISSION. SO FIRST THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXTENSIVE AND DEDICATED AND INCREDIBLY VALUABLE GOVERNMENT SERVICE AND WE INVITE YOU. TO START US OFF THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER NOW [inaudible] THE WITH RESPECT TO MY RESUME THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T SAY NO. BUT THE GOOD MORNING TO ALL OF YOU -- I PAID OR NOT AND I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN AGENCY CHARGED WITH RECOMMENDING WAYS. TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE GOVERNMENT. LAST YEAR THE COMMISSION AND BARKED ON ELEVEN MONTHS STUDY TO UNDERSTAND HOW OUR STATE IS PREPARING FOR THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THE OPPORTUNITIES. THAT A I CAN PROVIDE TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. LAST FALL WE RELEASED OUR REPORT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE A ROAD MAP FOR CALIFORNIA. OUR STAFF HAS PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE WITH ADDITIONAL COPIES OF THE REPORT I BELIEVE YOU HAVE. ARE OU INCLUDED UP PUBLIC HEARINGS AND ADVISORY MEETINGS AND WAS INFORMED BY CONVERSATIONS WITH. NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS MUCH AS YOU ARE GOING TO BE DOING WITH YOUR SELECT COMMITTEE AS WELL. DOOR STUDY WE IDENTIFIED MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES. A A I CAN BE USED TO HELP EMERGENCY RESPONDERS PREDICT WHERE AND WHEN FIRES ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR YOU CAN ASK -- MISTER-GELLER DUTY SECRETARIAL TO CHIP OUT HOW THEY ARE APPLYING THOSE IN THEIR PARK. HEY I MAY HELP CATERS AND DOES% HELP EDUCATORS IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES AND INCREASE GRADUATION RATES. AND WHILE CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE STRIDES TO IMPROVE OPERATIONS AND SERVICES EMPLOYMENT OR TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY UNDER pPREPARE. TO RESPOND IN ADOPTED THE SPEED WITH WHICH ARTIFICIAL% INTELLIGENCE IS CHANGING OUR WORLD. IT BECAME CLEAR TO USTHROUGH OUR RESEARCH THE CALIFORNIA LACKS THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE. TO IMPLEMENT A AYE IN STATE GOVERNMENT. WE'RE FALLING BEHIND OTHER STATES. LIKE INDIANA. MICHIGAN AND VERMONT. WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND A TECHNOLOGICAL POWERHOUSE BUT THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT A STRATEGIC PLANNING VOID EXISTS AND STATE GOVERNMENT. AROUND SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITIES OF A AYE AND MINIMIZING ITS RISKS. WE SHOULD TEN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. TO PROVIDE THE VISION AND COORDINATION TO GOVERN FOR THE FUTURE. THIS INCLUDES ESTABLISHING A AYE LEADERSHIP AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF STATE GOVERNMENT. WE RECOMMENDED INCLUDING THE CABINET LEVEL A AYE SPECIAL ADVISER TO OVERSEE THE BENEFICIAL AND TRANSPARENT DEPLOYMENT THEY AYE TECHNOLOGY. AND APPLICATIONS OF STATE GOVERNMENT. WE ADVOCATE FOR THE CREATION OF AN EXPERT COMMISSION FROM DIVERSE SECTORS TO DEVELOP INCORPORATE THEY ARE RELATED DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR CRITICAL STATE SERVICES. WE ALSO CALL FOR THE STATE TO IMPROVE THE COLLECTION OF DATA ON JOBS AND SKILLS FOR FUTURE WORKERS. CALIFORNIA SHOULD IMPLEMENT CHANGES TO PROPERLY FORECAST A EYES AFFECTS ON EMPLOYMENT. WE PROPOSE DEVELOPING OUR WORKFORCE BY PROMOTING APPRENTICESHIPS AND TRAINING FOR WORKERS WHO JOBS MAY BE DESTROYED. OR TRANSFORMED BY. THIS INCLUDES REPAIRING OUR FUTURE WORKFORCE BY ENSURING AYE EDUCATIONS IS SUCCESSFUL. IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. WE HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO SEE THE INTEREST BY THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP. CALIFORNIA LEAD ON A THE CREATION OF THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION IN THE FUTURE OF WORK COMMISSION UNDER GOVERNOR NEWSOME DEMONSTRATES THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO UNDERSTAND HOW TECHNOLOGY. CAN DELIVER BETTER GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE WORK FORCE. WE PROUDLY SUPPORT THREE BILLS. INCLUDING SENATE BILL THREE FORTY EIGHT BY SENATOR JANE WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE STRATEGIC PLANS TO USE A AYE TACK. TO IMPROVE STATE SERVICES AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC SECTOR WORSE WORSE AND JOB CLASSIFICATIONS. AB. NINE SEVEN SIX ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHALL WOULD CREATE AN A I COMMISSION TO DEVELOP A AYE RELATED DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR CRITICAL STATE SERVICES. AND TO STUDY HOW DATA SCIENCE CAN BE EFFECTIVELY USED BY STATE GOVERNMENT. AB FIVE NINE FOUR SALAS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO APPOINT A CHIEF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER TO EVALUATE THE USES OF A AYE IN STATE GOVERNMENT. AND THERE ARE OTHER BILLS AS WELL THEY CAN HELP MOVE CALIFORNIA. FOR AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY SIX BY CALDERON WOULD APPOINT AN A I WORKING GROUP RELATED TO THE USE OF A AYE. BY CALIFORNIA BASED BUSINESSES AND DEFINE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN STATE LAW. AND SENATE BILL SEVEN FIVE TWO SENATOR STERN. WOULD CREATE A PUBLIC PROCESS TO GATHER INPUT AND UNDERSTAND ECONOMIC SOCIAL WORKPLACE AND TECHNOLOGICAL LANDSCAPE OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR CONVENING THIS CRITICAL CONVERSATION. LOU HOOVER COMMISSION STANDS READY TO HELP CALIFORNIA LEAD IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF A AYE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS THAT I'M CAPABLE OF ANSWERING. BUT I ALSO. WANT TO POINT OUT. HOW? PRESENT ISSUES ON A. I. R.. SO. THIS MORNING I WAS READING THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. AND SAW ONE OF THE ARTICLES IS APPRENTICED PLANS FACE RETOOLING. SO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS -- PROPOSED CHANGES TO APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. THE SENSUALLY REMOVING SUPERVISION OF A PRESSURE PROGRAMS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. AND RELYING MORE ON OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR GROUPS AS WELL AS A BUSINESS AND LABOR UNIONS SO. UNDERSTANDING THE TRENDS AND APPLYING A I'D. PARTICULARLY IN THE FACE OF THESE KINDS OF CHANGES WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT TO WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE WAS A ON THAT SAME PAGE THE STORY THE TRUMP ADVISORS CALL JOB TRAINING EFFORTS IN AFFECTED. SO YOU CAN'T MANAGE WHAT YOU CAN'T MEASURE. TO ONE OF THE USES OF A AYE IS TO EVALUATE THE DIRECTION THAT WE ARE TRAVELING IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AS WELL AS OTHER AREAS. AND THEN COME UP WITH METRICS AND STANDARDS SO THAT WE CAN BETTER PREDICT WHERE WE THINK JOBS WILL BE IN THE FUTURE AND HOW TO TRAIN. A DIFFERENT SORT OF WORK FORCE. WE HAD TESTIMONY WILL HOOVER COMMISSION HAD TESTIMONY JUST LAST WEEK. FROM THE CHANCELLOR OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- EXPLAINED TO US THAT THE OLD NOTION OF A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA WHICH USED TO BE. THE PLACE WHERE YOU STARTED. ESSENTIALLY NOT THAT SIGNIFICANT ANYMORE. AND THAT WHAT MATTERS MORE OUR CERTIFICATIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT AND I DID WHEN HE FIRST BROACH THE SUBJECT BUT IT WOULD BE THE COLLEGE. EDUCATION OF COURSE THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF JOBS. BUT WHAT HE POINTED OUT IS IT MANY MANY EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES LOOK MORE TOWARDS CERTIFICATION IN SPECIFIC FIELDS OF WORK THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST AND HE EXPECTS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. IN THINKING ABOUT A I ALSO IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. WAS ANOTHER ARTICLE. CALLED CRADLES THE PEWS AND SHIFTING POLITICS. SO. THE THRUST OF THIS ARTICLE WAS THAT. THE BIRTH RATE IN AMERICA IS DECLINING. SO THE IMMEDIATE IMPLICATIONS ACTUALLY MAYBE NOT IMMEDIATE BUT THE IMPLICATIONS WILL BE FEWER WORKERS THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM. AND OTHER FORMS OF RETIREMENT PLANS. IT ALSO SEEMS TO ME THAT WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. TO GIVE US SOME IDEA ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS NEW SMALLER POPULATION. AND IN FACT PERHAPS WHAT WE SEE AS INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF A AYE MAYBE ONE ANSWER TO HOW IT IS WE DEAL WITH A UP OFA POPULATION THAT DOESN'T GROW IN THE SAME RATE AS IT DID IN THE PAST. THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE ARTICLE HAD TO DO WITH USE -- AND THE FACT THAT FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE IDENTIFY AS REGULARLY ATTENDING CHURCH. WELL WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING WELL I SUSPECT. THAT THE APPLICATION TODAY I WILL GIVE US SOME INSIGHT INTO WHERE DO PEOPLE. GO TO SEEK AFFIRMATION OF THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MAKE IN OUR LIVES THE FAITH COMMUNITY. HISTORICALLY PLAYS A ROLE IN PROVIDING COMFORT IN DIRECTION AND GUIDANCE IF THERE ARE FEWER PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO ORGANIZE CHURCHES. WHERE IN FACT WILL THEY GAIN THEIR INSPIRATION? WHO WILL THEY LOOK TO FOR DIRECTION AND AND FOR GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF HOW TO CONDUCT THEIR LIVES? I'M NOT SURE THAT WE WANT THEM. NECESSARILY GOING ONLINE. AND LOOKING AT YOUTUBE IN ORDER TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THEIR PLACE IN THE WORLD. BUT IT DOES RAISE SOME ISSUES THAT A I MAY BE HELPFUL IN OF REACHING SOME ANSWERS. SO. I HOPE I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU POSE IF NOT I'M LOOKING AT THE AGENDA AND YOU CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE SMARTER THAN I AM WITH A GREAT DEAL MORE EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER NOTA X. EXCELLENT KICK OFF AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR THE REVIEW OF WALL STREET DRIED UP TO READ IT TODAY SO. ALREADY. DONE THAT FOR ME SO CENTER BORDERS YOUR QUESTION. YEAH. REMARKS EVER GO. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN -- I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC. OUR COMMITTEE THAT YOU HAVE -- ESTABLISHED -- I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY -- IT COMMON KNOWLEDGE REALLY I HOPE IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE AT THIS POINT THAT WERE A BIT BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL. IN SO WITH WITH THAT IN MIND. OF MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. I SEE IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS A LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION -- OF CREATING LEADERSHIP POSTS. ARE OR ENHANCING EXISTING LEADERSHIP POSE FOR THOSE WHO COULD SERVE AS A INTERFACES WITHIN THE A. I. TOPICS IN A GIVEN -- WE SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH WILE AWAY AND HOW. THIS IS MORE OF A NATIONAL ISSUE BUT I THINK IT BEARS ON SILICON VALLEY IN OUR TECH SECTOR IS THAT -- WE RELY SO HEAVILY ON SUPPLY CHAIN IN INFORMATION -- ASSETS FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD. AND WE DON'T HAVE -- ANY REAL DOMESTIC PLAYERS THAT ARE -- IT ADVANCING THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT A RATE THAT WE NEED. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THIS IS. LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION INVOLVES THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE MY EXPERIENCE LEGISLATURE IS A WONDERFUL PART OF THE PROCESS. BUT THE SPEED AT WHICH WE NEED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. I CANNOT IMAGINE BEING ANYTHING OTHER THAN AT THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL. IN YOUR RECOMMENDATION OR IN YOUR OPINION DO YOU HAVE. A STRONG RECOMMENDATION. THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE CAN TAKE. ARE A COHERENT LEAD. EN ADVANCING. THE TECH RELATED TOPICS AT THE STATE LEVEL EVEN THOUGH THEY WOULD NORMALLY BE RESERVED -- FOR NATIONAL AND FEDERAL JURISDICTION GIVEN THE OPINIONS ON HOW GOVERNOR NEWSOME CAN. MOVE OUR SECTOR IN THAT RIGHT DIRECTION. WELL I I THINK WHAT WE SEEN FIRST OF ALL. DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ASK YOU THE FOR THE FOR THE SIX LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. SO WE ARE. HAVE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC LEVERAGE OVER WHAT HAPPENS AROUND THE WORLD IN THE EXAMPLE THAT WE SET FOR OTHERS WILL BE FALL USUALLY. ONE OF THE THINGS I REMEMBER AS OF CALIFORNIA IS DOING AND OTHER STATES WILL PROBABLY PURSUE PURSUE THE SAME. AVENUE. AND I I AGREE WITH YOU THAT LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND SO MANY OTHER START FROM THE TOP I REMEMBER HAVING A CONVERSATION SOMETIME BACK. WITH SOMEBODY ABOUT WANTING TO CHANGE OF POLICY. IN AN AGENCY AND THE ANSWER THAT I WAS GIVEN WAS AS SOON AS IT BECOMES POLICY WILL DO IT. SO WHEN THE GOVERNOR DECIDES THAT. HE OR MAYBE SOMEDAY SHE WANTS TO PURSUE A PARTICULAR AVENUE. PEOPLE JUST LINE UP. AND THAT'S THE WAY IT WILL HAPPEN AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT WITH LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE GOVERNOR. TO SEE WHAT IT IS THAT NEEDS TO BE PUT IN PLACE THAT THIS GOVERNOR CAN SUPPORT IN ORDER FOR IT TO BECOME POLICY. AND NOT JUST A CONVERSATION -- MAN MAN. ONE SO WE'VE HEARD ABOUT SMART CITIES AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT -- CHINA'S PREEMINENCE IN THIS IN THIS THIS FIELD IN THIS DEVELOPING FIELD -- WE SIT. CHAIRMAN I SAID ON JUDICIARY AND WE DEAL HEAVILY AND PRIVACY. ARE RELATED ISSUES SPECIALLY DURING THIS SESSION. DO YOU THINK THAT. AS WE TRIED -- RATING BACK THE FLOW OF INFORMATION FROM THOSE WHO GATHERED AND BROKER IT. THAT THAT WILL PUT HARD. TACK OPERATIVES AT A DISADVANTAGE COMPARED TO THE SHEER VOLUME. THAT CHINA HAS TO BRING INTO ITS SYSTEM IN LEARNING AND PREDICT HUMAN BEHAVIOR. YEAH WELL YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF CHINA HAS IS YOU KNOW. THEY'VE GOT A PRESIDENT FOR LIFE. IT IS TERRIBLY CONVENIENT WELL. JUST JUST. IF YOU'RE. YOU SHOULD SEE IT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA DECIDING. THAT HE WANTS SOMETHING TO BE POLICY THAN THINGS LINE UP. IMAGINE THAT ON STEROIDS IN CHINA BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY MANY MANY YEARS AGO THEY RECOGNIZED. THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO COMPETE IN A DIFFERENT WAY. ARM AND EMBRACED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE -- AND COMPUTER SCIENCES AND ALL THE REST I'M REMINDED. OF OF A STORY. THERE WAS A A CHINESE AVERELL. WHO -- EXPLORED THE WORLD I MEAN INCREDIBLE NAVY'S LARGER THAN ANY NAVIES THAT EVER EXISTED AT THAT TIME -- BUT THEN LEADERSHIP CHANGE IN CHINA. AND THAT DYNASTY DESTROYED THE SHIP'S BURNT THE COAST -- AND PROHIBIT ANYONE FROM BUILDING SHIPS LARGER THAN A PARTICULAR SIZE. BECAUSE CHINA DECIDED THEN THAT THEY WERE GOING TO TURN IN WORK. THAT LASTED FOR HOWEVER LONG IT LASTED. BUT IT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE AND HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME. AND SO YOU SEE CHINA ENGAGED IN PLACES LIKE AFRICA -- MAKING SIGNIFICANT. INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE -- WHERE IN FACT THE COLLATERAL IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF SO THAT IF THE COUNTRY UNABLE TO MAKE ITS PAYMENT GUESS WHAT THEY GET A PORT? SO THEY'RE VERY FORWARD LOOKING IF IF AMERICA. IS GO HAS ANY HOPE OF CATCHING UP. IT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE MUCH MORE ASSERTIVE. ABOUT PURSUING A AYE HOWEVER. WHAT MAKES WHAT WE DO HERE IN THIS COUNTRY? A LITTLE DIFFERENT IS WE DO HAVE RESPECT FOR IDEAS OF PRIVACY. AND SO WHAT WE HEARD DURING OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS OF OUT. THE PURSUIT OF A I WE NEED TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE ROLE OF REGULATION. IN THROTTLING BACK INNOVATION SO THAT [inaudible] IF. WE REACT IN A WAY THAT. IS REFLECTIVE OF ANXIETY AND FEAR FOR THE TECHNOLOGY. THEN WE COULD END UP IN A SITUATION THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHERE THERE'S A DISINCENTIVE. TO PURSUE THAT WHICH WE NEED. WHICH IS A PART OF WHY SOME A RECOMMENDATION IN THE REPORT IS AT THE STATE NEEDS TO ACTIVELY. AND AGGRESSIVELY ENGAGE IN A PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAM. TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND A I AND ITS BENEFITS SO THAT WE UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE RISKS. WHEN YOU SEE STORIES ABOUT FACIAL RECOGNITION IN YOUR WALKING THE REPORTS AND GUESS WHAT? THEY'RE GOING TO PROFILE YOU THAT MAKES PEOPLE ANXIOUS WHEN THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT OUT. BY -- CERTAIN -- FOR COMPANIES THAT EVALUATE IMPACTS OF A AYE UNEMPLOYMENT AND PREDICTS 60% LOSSES IN JOBS THAT MAKES PEOPLE SCARED. AND THE RESPONSES TO TURN TO YOU. AND SAY I DON'T WANT. TO I DON'T WANT TO LOSE MY JOB BECAUSE A I HAS CHANGED I AM A TO THE WORKPLACE. AND YOU'LL GET PRESSURE UNLESS IT'S HANDLED CORRECTLY TO DO JUST THAT. WE WERE VERY. PLEASED THAT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS OF OUR REPORT. BUT LABOR UNIONS -- BECAUSE CALIFORNIA SUCH AS SIGNIFICAN EMPLOYER. OF OF OF PEOPLE IN OPERATING THE STATE. AND WHAT WE HEARD FROM THEM FOR THE MOST PART WAS. WE UNDERSTAND IT'S COMING WE REALIZE ARE GOING TO BE IMPLICATIONS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT TRAINING IS PUT IN PLACE AS PART OF THE RESPONSE TO ADOPT. A LOT BUT THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS. WE HAVE TO STRIKE A BALANCE AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THROUGH A PROCESS OF THE EXERCISE OF WISDOM. AND INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION GATHERING. AND SCIENCE AND DATA AND TALKING TO STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH A ON HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THEIR PRIVACY PROTECTIONS BUT HOW DO HOW DO WE NOT. CREATE A DISINCENTIVE TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING [inaudible] WHAT? THANK YOU -- SOME OF NUMBER NAVA. EXCELLENT WAY TO KICK OFF ONE MORE QUESTION IS YOU'D MENTIONED SEVERAL IS THESE ARE AHEAD OF US IF YOU WERE TO PICK ONE EXAMPLE FROM ANY OTHER STATES THAT. ARE AHEAD OF CALIFORNIA WHAT WHAT WITH THAT EXAMPLE BE. WELL MIKE PENCE'S FROM INDIANA SO LET'S START THERE. SO INDIANA STATE LEADERS CREATED. THE FUTURE OF WORK TASK FORCE TO STUDY NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND DIVIDES INNOVATIVE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES TO DRIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY SO. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE APPLYING A AYE BUT THEY ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU. THAT THEIR OPPORTUNITIES HERE. I THINK INITIALLY. AND I'M SORT OF A ROUND ABOUT WAY ISSUE QUESTIONER NUMBER STATE BUT INITIALLY -- WHAT HAPPENED [inaudible] IS. THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE IN THE A COMMUNITY THAT WERE A LITTLE OVER ENTHUSIASTIC. AND TALKING ABOUT HOW. THE ROBOTS RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO END UP DOING ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS AND SCARED AND SCARE PEOPLE TO DEATH. THAT PERSPECTIVE IS CHANGE. IN IN IN IN A COUPLE WAYS NOW I SEE THEM CALLED CALL BOX. THERE WILL BE THE APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT WILL WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH. THE EMPLOYEE. TO GET THE TASK DONE SO THAT A AYE IS DOING THE REPETITIVE SORT OF MINDLESS. NUMBING KINDS OF THINGS THAT WILL FREE UP THE EMPLOYEE TO USE CREATIVITY AND INGENUITY -- AND AND THEIR OWN ABILITY TO HELP PROBLEMS ALL. SO THEY TALK ABOUT WORKING IN COOPERATION -- YOU LOOK AT AN APPLICATION FOR EXAMPLE IN AGRICULTURE. SO THEY AYE IN AGRICULTURE CAN HELP WITH THE DIMINISH THE USE OF PESTICIDES BY THE VERY PRECISELY ADMINISTERING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BASED ON CONDITIONS THAT ARE. OBSERVED ON THE GROUND SO IN THE END IS A GOOD PLACE. MASSACHUSETTS HAS ESTABLISHED A COMMISSION ON DIGITAL INNOVATION AND LIFELONG LEARNING. THAT'S ANOTHER ASPECT OF THIS THAT. THE CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL BECAUSE YOU HAVE OLDER. OF FOLKS I MEAN I REMEMBER. I'M ALL OKAY I'M SEVENTY ONE YEARS OLD AND I REMEMBER GROWING UP THE DREAM WAS TO GET A JOB AND YOU'RE THERE FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS. GET YOUR PENSION RETIRE EAGLE FISH OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU LIKE TO DO. BUT THEN I HAD A FRIEND TELL ME THE OTHER DAY NO NO NO THE FUTURE SIX TEN NINETY NINES. PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE HAVING ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT JOBS OVER THE COURSE OF A LIFETIME MINUTES COMING TRUE. A FEW PEOPLE HAVE LIFETIME JOBS ANYMORE. SO HEY I IS GOING TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IF IT'S APPLIED. CORRECT. TO HELP ENSURE THAT YOU DON'T LOSE THE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING. AND THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO GROW AND DEVELOP AND AND MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. THE NOTION OF WORK IS GOING TO CHANGE. OVER TIME BECAUSE OF A I WHAT IT IS THAT WE ARE YOU KNOW I WORK FOR A WHILE IN A STEEL MILL. YOU CAN'T HAVE ANYTHING MORE MACHO THAN THAT RIGHT. THERE'S LIKE METAL FLYING ALL OVER THE PLACE IF YOU'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME TO GET BURNED IN YOUR SEAT AFTER-YOU GET THE MOVE STUFF. THAT WAS GREAT. BUT THAT'LL CHANGE AND IT HAS CHANGED. INTO WHERE YOU JUST PUSH THE BUTTON AND THOSE SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO GO. I READ A BOOK. AND THIS AUTHORS PERSPECTIVE WAS. THIS A AYE REVOLUTION IS DIFFERENT FROM AUTOMATION. IN THE AUTOMATION. WE CREATED MACHINES THAT WOULD DO THE WORK THAT PEOPLE WERE DOING. RIGHT BUT A HIGH IS DOING THE THINKING. THAT IS IT THAT IS A DRAMATIC SHIFT. AND IT'S NOT. VIED FOR MEMBERS OPPORTUNITIES FOR US AND IT ALSO CARRIES WITH IT RISKS. AND I DO THINK THAT THE THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER POLICY MAKERS LIKE YOURSELVES. IS IN EXPLORING THOUGH SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND IT WELL. AND KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE IT TO OTHERS TO HELP. MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE CHANGES ARE COMING. THANK YOU KNOW -- THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS WILL EXCUSE YOU LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. NOT WHAT WHAT WE'RE OVER THERE AND I WANTED MONEY GIVE. THANKS -- TO MY STAFF. WITH A NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE WORK BY STAFF COMMUNICATING WITH ALL OF THE PEOPLE AND THE PHONE TWO DOCTOR WHO DO COME TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE LITTLE HOOVER -- DO ON OUR OWN DONE. WE CAN'T COMPEL THEM TO TESTIFY -- AND THEY OFFERED THE BEST INFORMATION THEY HAVE AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO BE ON THE SHOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- I WE ALSO WELCOME -- CENTERED RUSSELL. THANK YOU SENATOR RUSSELL. WHAT WE'LL DO IS LET'S LET'S CALL THE ROLL HERE -- CHAIR NUMBER HERE [inaudible] SENATOR BORDERS. SENATOR CHIANG. SENATOR RAZA. YES SENATOR STERN. SENATOR WINNER. WE HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU -- NEXT UP WE HAVE A DOCTOR OF SOME YEARS SAYING DOCTOR. PROFESSOR OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. IRVINE -- WORKS ON LARGE SCALE INTERVAL. MACHINE LEARNING APPLIED INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING -- I'M I'M SURE WILL UNDERSTAND THAT SO -- BEFORE YOU SEE AYE. DOCTOR SAYING WAS A POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON HE RECEIVED HIS PHD FROM UNIVERSITY MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF ANDREW MCCOLLUM DURING WHICH HE ALSO INTERNED AT MICROSOFT. RESEARCH GOOGLE RESEARCH AND YAHOO LABS. HE WAS AWARDED THE ADOBE RESEARCH DATA SCIENCE FACULTY AWARD WAS SELECTED AS A STAR PART RISER. ONE THE GRAND PRIZE IN THE YELP DATA SAID CHALLENGE AND RECEIVE THE YAHOO KEY SCIENTIFIC CHALLENGE AWARD. A DOCTOR SINGLE GIVE US A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF A AYE -- IN TALK ABOUT MULTIPLE WAYS TO REDUCE BIAS IN A AYE INCLUDING INCREASING DIVERSITY. IN A AYE TECHNOLOGIES THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA LABELING COLLECTION. INSURING LESS BIAS IN INPUT DATA AND UTILIZING MACHINE LEARNING TO CHECK A EYES OUTPUT. FOR BY SEIZE -- DOCTOR SAYING LOOK THE FLOOR IS YOURS MAYBE START BY TELLING US WHAT A DARK ARISE OR IS. THAT WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT ARE PRO WAS LOOKING OUT FOR YOUNG SCIENTISTS TO SORT OF LOOK AT AS FUTURE. PEOPLE WHO. ARE USED TO REMEMBER WHAT DARPA STOOD FOR WHAT DOES IT STAND FOR DEFENDS IN BONDS RESEARCH. BEING ADMINISTRATION STANDS FOR DARPA YEAH THEY WON'T BE HAPPY THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT. OKAY ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT WELL SORRY FOR THAT -- ALL RIGHT -- DOCTOR SAYING THAT THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU YEAH SO I'M GOING TO GIVE A OVERVIEW OFF A I TRIED TO KEEP IT PRETTY ON NON TECHNICAL -- AND THEN I'LL ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS AT THE END. SO JUST THINKING ABOUT WHAT A AYE IS VERY BROADLY SPEAKING IT'S DEFINED AS ANY SOFTWARE -- THAT IS ABLE TO CARRY OUT COGNITIVE DOS. SAMPLES OF COGNITIVE TASKS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE DRIVING ON TRANSLATING LANGUAGES ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WORLD -- BEING ABLE TO DIAGNOSE DISEASE. OF PLAYING GAMES UNDERSTANDING SPEECH THESE ARE ALL SORT OF HIGHER LEVEL COGNITIVE COSTS AND IF A SOFTWARE. THAT'S ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE -- UNFORTUNATELY THE STIFF DEFINITIONS START REALLY USEFUL IT'S NOT VERY PRECISE PARTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T TEND TO AGREE WITH WHAT THE COGNITIVE COSTS ARE. AND THERE IS THIS AND THIS NOTION KNOWN AS A AYE EFFECT. WHERE IF A COMPUTER CAN DO IT WE DON'T THINK OF IT AS AN INTELLIGENT ASK ANYMORE -- AND SO THE DEFINITION OF A I SORT OF CHANGES AS WE GET BETTER AT DOING A AYE -- SO INSTEAD WHAT'S MUCH MORE USEFUL IS TO THINK ABOUT WHY A AYE IS CURRENTLY. ON TRANSFORMING SOCIETY AND IT'S IT'S REALLY IN THE CENTER FOR YOU -- AND THAT IS TO LOOK AT MACHINE LEARNING THIS IS OF THIS IS WHAT MAJORITY OF AA LOOKS LIKE RIGHT NOW YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF MACHINE LEARNING ALMOST INTERCHANGEABLY BUT THEY I AND THE IDEA HERE IS THAT. MACHINE LEARNING IS TRYING TO CREATE SOFTWARE -- THAT LOANS TO WHAT TO DO FROM EXAMPLES. IN OTHER WORDS IT'S TRYING TO IMPROVE AUTOMATICALLY WITH EXPERIENCE. AND IF IT IMPROVES TO THE EXTENT THAT IT CAN DO THE INTELLIGENT COGNITIVE PROCESS. THEN -- YOU HAVE IN A A SOFTWARE. SO JUST TO BE MORE PRECISE LET'S STICK OR EXAMPLE. SUPPOSE YOU NEED SOME SOFTWARE THAT CAN TAKE ONE FOR DOLE -- AND TELL YOU WHETHER THAT. FOR TO OFTEN ANIMAL IS A WOLF OR A HUSKY ON HUSKIES A BREED OF DOG THAT LOOKS A LOT LIKE A WOLF -- AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU GIVE THE FIRST IMAGE TO THE SOFTWARE IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE WORLD BECAUSE IT IS. AND IF YOU GIVE IT A SECOND IMAGE IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL YOU THAT'S A HUSKY. I SAID TO GIVE YOU SOME IN TUITION FOR HALL OF THE SOFTWARE IS SORT OF LOOKED. THE WAY THE MACHINE LEARNING BOOKS. IS YOU HAVE THE STEP OF TRAINING AND AND SO WHAT YOU WOULD DO HERE IS YOU WOULD COLLECT A LOT OF EXAMPLES OF FOUR DOORS OF WHEELS. ANOTHER SET OF EXAMPLES OF PHOTOS OF HUSKIES AND YOU WOULD USE THEM TO TRAIN YOUR SOFTWARE -- SO THE SOFTWARE WOULD LOOK AT ALL OF THESE EXAMPLES. AND IT'LL. FROM THESE EXAMPLES LOW AND WHAT MAKES A WILL FOR WOLF AND WHAT MAKES A HUSKY A HUSKY. AND STORE SOME REPRESENTATION OF THIS KNOWLEDGE INTERNALLY. AND THEN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO USE IT -- YOU BASICALLY ALSO GET TO GUESS ON NEW IMAGES. SO ONCE THE SOFTWARE IS TRAINED YOU GIVE IT A NEW FOR DON'T -- AND THE SOFTWARE WILL USE WHAT IT HAS SEEN ALL YEAR TO MAKE A GUESS. IF IT SUCCESSFULLY TRAINED THEN IT WILL GET IT -- RIGHT MORE OFTEN THAN IT WILL NOT AND IF YOU GET A DATE. ALMOST 100% IF IT'S REALLY REALLY GOOD. SO IN THIS EXAMPLE THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THESE ARE SIX FOUR DOES THAT IT HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE -- AND THE SOFTWARE THAT WE TRAINED. GETS A GRADE FIVE OF THE SIX TIMES -- WHICH IS QUITE IMPRESSIVE IT'S ACTUALLY -- YOU MIGHT SAY THAT AS LOAN HOLDEN FRIEND SHARED BETWEEN WILSON HUSKY THAT CASE IT'S A DOING A BETTER JOB THAN I WOULD SO. THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING. ARM AND SO LET'S THINK A LITTLE BIT BROADLY ABOUT WHAT THE MACHINE LEARNING ACTUALLY IS -- AND SO THE IDEA WITH MACHINE LEARNING IS THAT WHATEVER PROBLEM YOU'RE INTERESTED IN YOU SORT OF SPLIT IT INTO WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE INPUT TO YOUR SYSTEM. AND WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE OUTPUT -- AND YOU FIRST GATHERED BEARS OF INPUT AND OUTPUT THAT YOU USED TO TRAIN YOUR MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS -- AND MACHINE LEARNING ARE GOOD THEM ONCE IT STRAINED IT GIVES YOU THE SOFTWARE -- THAT WILL TAKE NEW IN BOTH STUDIED HASN'T SEEN BEFORE. AND TRY TO GUESS WHAT THE OUTPUT WITH -- THREE SO LET'S LOOK AT A FEW EXAMPLES SO IF YOU WANT TO CREATE A MACHINE LEARNING SOFTWARE THAT CAN PREDICT WHETHER LOAN SHOULD BE GRANTED OR NOT. THE INPUT HERE WOULD BE THE DETAILS OF THE LOAN APPLICATION EVERYTHING THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO IN THE LOAN APPLICATION. AND THE OUTPUT WILL BE WHETHER THE LOAN. WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT IF GRANTED. AND WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS YOU WOULD USE BOSS DATA TO COLLECT -- SUCH EXAMPLES AND USE THAT TO TRAIN YOUR MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS SO IN BOSTON. YOU GROUND SOME LOANS AND THE PERSON I DID NOT WANT TO PAY IT BACK. THAT'S A BAD APPLICATION ARE BAD LOAN APPLICATION. IF YOU WANT TO DIAGNOSE DISEASES WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS YOUR INPUT WOULD BE ALL OF THE PATIENTS SYMPTOMS THAT'S NUMBER TWO THERE. AND YOUR OUTPUT WOULD BE THE DISEASE THAT THE PATIENT HAS AND FOR TRAINING PURPOSES YOU WOULD GATHER DATA BY HAVING A DOCTOR DECIDE WITH THE DISEASE SHOULD BE. OUR AND SORT OF USING THAT DRAIN YOUR SOFTWARE. FINALLY THIS TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF CONSOLATION WHERE. YOU WANT TO TRANSLATE FROM ENGLISH TO SPANISH FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT DO THAT ON GOOGLE TRANSLATE. THE INPUT HERE WOULD BE A ENGLISH SENTENCE. AND THE OUTPUT HERE IS GOING TO BE A SPINE IF AND BANDS AND SO AGAIN TO TRAIN AND YOU RIGHT TO THE SPANISH SENTENCE -- BY A TRANSLATOR AND GIVE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE TO THE SOFTWARE. AND SO ONCE THIS TRAINING IS FINISHED YOU GET A SOFTWARE WHICH CAN TAKE ANY NEW INPUT. AND PREDICT WHAT ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE SO SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE. A NEW PATIENT IN ALL OF ITS SYMPTOMS AND IT CAN PREDICT WHAT THE DISEASE THE PATIENT HOUSE. OF WITHOUT THE NEED OF A DOCTOR AT THAT POINT. I TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A ENGLISH SENTENCE AND GIVE YOU THE FINEST SENTENCE WITHOUT THE NEED OF A TRANSIT. SO ONE OF THE MAJOR QUESTIONS AS WELL WHY DOES IT WORK AND HOW IS IT ABLE -- TO WISE MACHINE LEARNING SO SO PREVALENT. AND HEAR A SORT OF THE TWO PRIMARY REASONS. OF WHICH COMBINED TOGETHER TO MAKE MACHINE LEARNING WORKED THE WAY IT DOES SAY NOW. THE FIRST IS THAT A WHOLE LOT OF EXAMPLES ARE AVAILABLE -- TO TRAIN SOFT RIGHT NOW THIS IS MOSTLY WITH THE BIG DATA LUCIEN BUT STORAGE COMPETITION BEING J. CHEAP WITH PROFIT PERFORATION OF INTERNET WE JUST HAVE A LOT OF EXAMPLES. PRETTY MUCH ANY DOS THAT -- THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO TRAIN MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS -- TO ANYBODY WHO STORING ANY KIND OF DATA CAN POTENTIALLY USE IT AS A WAY TO TRAIN MACHINE RUNNING ON THE SECOND PART OF THIS WHOLE. PROCESS THAT MAKES MACHINE LEARNING -- SO PREVALENT IS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF COMPLEX MATH AND COMPETITION THAT'S INVOLVED. AND ASK COMPUTING BECOMES CHEAPER -- THE SOFTWARE INTERNALLY KEEPS BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMPLEX AND IT'S ABLE TO SUPPORT MORE COMPLEX. OPERATIONS. I'M THIS COMBINATION OF LOTS OF EXAMPLES AND LOT OF COMPETITION IS ACTUALLY QUITE AMAZING IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH DATA AND IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH COMPETITION -- THE GUESS IS THAT THEY ARE MADE BY THIS MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS CAN BE ARBITRARILY GOOD. SO YOU KNOW IN MANY CASES YOU MAY NOT HAVE AN UPDATE OR COMPETITION BUT IF YOU DO -- SO SKY'S THE LIMIT [inaudible] BEYOND [inaudible] SO ARM. I DO WANT TO GIVE A CABBIE OUT AND TALK A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT THIS -- IT'S NOT ALL JUST GOOD NEWS -- THE THE TING THAT HAPPENS WITH MACHINE LEARNING IS THAT IT'S TRYING TO MATCH THE OLD PORT THE BEST IT CAN -- WHICH IS IN SOME SENSE MANY DIFFERENT FROM AN INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR. WHAT MACHINE LEARNING IS REALLY GOOD AT IS MIMICKING INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR? TO THE EXTENT THAT IT CAN. GET THE ANSWER RIGHT BUT THE REASONING PROCESS MAY NOT BE THE SAME AS WHAT WE WOULD DO. OTHERS ALSO GOING TO DO THE SECOND GABBY ART -- WHICH IS THAT IN MOST CASES THE UNDERLYING REASONING OFF THE SOFTWARE HOW IT CAME TO MAKE A DECISION. IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE -- IN ANY JUDITH FORM OR IN ANY ACCESSIBLE FORM THAT WE CAN EASILY GRADY AND OF IT -- AND SO. THAT SORT OF CAUSES A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCEPT. AND THE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO MEANS THAT SOMETIMES MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS THAT I WOULD SAY OFTEN MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS. END UP CHEATING IN REYES THAT ARE NOT VERY OBVIOUS SO I GAVE YOU -- THIS WILL FOR AND HUSKY EXAMPLE IF IT DON'T DO IT. OF RETARDED LOOKED QUITE INTELLIGENT -- BUT ACTUALLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND I DIDN'T TELL YOU THIS. WAS THE FACT THAT IT WAS PRIMARILY DETECTING SNOWFALL IN THE IMAGE. SO ALL THIS OFFER WAS DOING WAS LOOKING FOR WHITE STUFF ON THE GROUND WHICH IS ACTUALLY PRETTY EASY TO DO. AND IF IT SAW WHITE STUFF ON THE GROUND IT PREDICTED WOLF AND IF IT DID NOT. A PREDICTED HUSKY. AND THAT WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN THE MISTAKE IT MAKES WHEN IT HAPPENS. ARMED. WITH IN A SNOWY ENVIRONMENT. BUT FOR THE STARS. CLEARLY THIS IS NOT INTENDED BEHAVIOR THIS IS NOT AS INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR. BUT IN JUST IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF GUESSES THAT BOOK CORRECT IT CAUGHT -- REALLY REALLY HIGH ON THE HIGH SCORE. AND SO IF YOU COULD GET IT. TO EXPLAIN WHY IT WAS MAKING THESE DECISIONS YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SPOT BUT THIS IS AN ERROR BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S EASILY SUPPORTED IN MACHINE LEARNING AS WE KNOW SO. JUST TO SOME REYES -- THE TALKS SO FAR. WE HAVE DEFINED A A AS ANY SOFTWARE THAT CAN CARRY OUT INTELLIGENT COGNITIVE LEE -- HEAVY DAS OF AND THE MOST PROMINENT APPROACH FOR ARE IS THIS IDEA OF MACHINE LEARNING. WHERE YOU JUST CREATE SOFTWARE THAT LOANS FROM EXPEDIENCE THOSE COMPLEX MOUNTAIN WALLS COMPETITION INVOLVED? BUT THERE IS ALSO THIS ASPECT OF EXPEDIENCE WHICH IS PURELY -- GIVEN BY THE DATA YOU GIVE TO SYSTEM AND THE MORE EXAMPLES YOU GIVE THE MORE. ACCURATE IT GETS OF THE BETTER IT GETS AND THE MORE INTELLIGENT ITS ITS BEHAVIOR LOOKS. AND THEN THERE IS THE SIGNIFICANT EVERY OTHER TO DESTROYING TO MIMIC INTELLIGENCE THE BEST IT CAN. SINCE IT IS LEARNING FROM THE DATE OF THAT THAT THIS -- BEING PROVIDED. IT CAPTURES ALL THE PATTERNS THAT ARE IN THE DATA. THAT'S BOTH A POSITIVE AND A NEGATIVE ASPECT AS WE SAW IN THE WILL FOSSE CASE IT IS CAPTURING SOME SPOT ON BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ALL WANT TO DO -- AND THE CONCERN IS THAT IN IN MOST REAL APPLICATIONS THERE'S ALWAYS UNDECIDABLE BY TONS AND THE DATE ARE -- THAT ARE BY A SEIZE THAT ARE PRESENT BECAUSE OF MISTAKES OF BECAUSE OF THE WAY SOCIETY'S DOCTOR RIGHT NOW. AND MACHINE LEARNING BY PICKING UP ON THESE SORT OF REINFORCES THE SAME. PRICES AND ITS OUTPUT AS WELL. SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE THINK ABOUT MACHINE LEARNING. THAT'S ABOUT HALF FULL THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR ZING THANK YOU FOR COMING TO VISIT WITH US A COUPLE THINGS. ONE IS OUR COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY AS LEGISLATORS IS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF CALIFORNIANS ARE AT LEAST TO PROTECT THE QUALITY OF LIFE IS THAT EXISTS -- AND SO WITH RESPECT TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE YOU'VE -- DEDICATED YOUR YOUR LIFE TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLORATION. TWO QUESTIONS ONE WHAT ARE YOU MOST EXCITED ABOUT TERMS OF IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE CALIFORNIANS AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOU MOST CONCERNED ABOUT -- SO LET ME START WITH THE CONCERNED ABOUT ASPECT SO -- I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF POSITIVE RESULTS OF MACHINE LEARNING THAT SEEM PROMISING AND TRANSFORMATIVE. FOR MANY DIFFERENT AREAS OF BUT THE CABBIE OUT CERTAIN AREN'T READY RATHER UNDERSTOOD I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE ALGORITHMS PROBABLY APPRECIATE BUT EVEN ONE STEP REMOVED IT'S DIFFICULT -- TO MAKE THAT DIVISION AND SO IF YOU. DON'T DO A GRADUAL OR INFORMED DOLE OUT OF MACHINE LEARNING A FOR ANY APPLICATION -- THAT ARE SORT OF OF THE CAN BE SIDE EFFECTS THAT YOU DON'T REALIZE SO -- WHETHER IT'S EIGHT IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE A NOT ALREADY HIGH STATE APPLICATION BUT IF THAT OUR BIASES THERE THEY GET REINFORCED IN WAYS THAT -- WE DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND RIGHT NOW SO. YOU KNOW PEOPLE USED TO THINK OF LOS STEAK PAYING WELL YOU CAN ALWAYS READ THE NEWS YOU WANT TO READ SO WHY DOES. RECOMMENDING USE MATTER SO MUCH BUT WE'VE SEEN -- IN THE BUS THAT WHAT PEOPLE REGIONALLY INFORMS THEIR DECISIONS WHEN THEY GO TO THE ELECTION -- AND SO. IF THERE ARE BIASES IN MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM THEY CAN GET AFFECTED IN WAYS THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND YET SO -- DID THE CAVEAT IS FOR THE ALLOWED TO BE INFORMED AND GRADUATE TO SOME DEGREE -- IN TERMS OF WHAT I'M MOST EXCITED ABOUT -- MY RESEARCH IS. PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON BEING ABLE. TO READ AND UNDERSTAND TEXT -- AND SO. NG ABLE TO INGEST A LOT OF TEXT AND BEING ABLE TO OUR ANSWER ANY QUESTION ABOUT IT BEING ABLE TO EXTRACT INFORMATION ABOUT IT. AND EFFECTIVELY BEING ABLE -- TO DO INFERENCES AND REASONING OVER LARGE COLLECTION OF TEXT WITHOUT REQUIRING YOU TO ACTUALLY READ IT -- THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN TRANSFORM RADIUS FOR YOUTH AND THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M MOST EXCITED [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SIR BORDERS [inaudible] THANK CHAIRMAN. LOOK AT YOUR YOUR SLIDE THERE AND IT SAYS. ON THE THIRD BULLET -- RATHER THE THE SECOND. ONE THE MORE EXAMPLES YOU GIVE THE BETTER A CAT'S. SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS ARE WE IN A SITUATION STILL OR IS IT CHANGING DRAMATICALLY WHERE. INPUT. IS -- BY DESIGN AS OPPOSED TO THE MACHINE'S ABILITY OR THE PLATFORM SOFTWARE'S ABILITY. TO ACCESS -- WORLD PLATFORMS IN INFORMATION -- NETWORKS ON ITS OWN. TO CREATE ITS OWN INPUT. OKAY -- YEAH SO WE ARE NOT IN THE SECOND STAGE AT ALL -- SO THE QUALITY OF WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS. IN THE UNIVERSE FROM WHICH IT WILL. ANALYZE THE INFORMATION IN AND PRODUCE AN OUTCOME YES. YES AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT STEP -- IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT REGULATION AND THINGS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IS WHAT SET OF EXAMPLES IS BEING GIVEN TO THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM. WE SHOULD BE WELL AWARE OF FOR IT AND THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS. WHAT WE CONTROL SO IF WE'RE LOOKING AT? OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD -- WITH. SMART CITIES FOR EXAMPLE. AND CREATING OUT OF NOTHING -- ENVIRONMENTS CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS WHERE AUTOMOBILES CAN BE STUDIED -- THE ENVIRONMENT -- IS RESTRAINED FOR MAXIMUM LEARNING -- SO WANTED SO FORTH. THAT IS IS THAT WOULD YOU SAY THAT IS JUST SIMPLY A TEMPLATE FOR LEARNING THAT AT SOME POINT IT WILL GRADUATE BEYOND. THAT INPUT PHASE THAT MANUAL INPUT PHASE INTO ITS OWN CAPACITY TO REACH OUT INTO -- THE INFORMATION NETWORKS. SO ON THE REACHING OUT INTO INFORMATION NETWORKS -- FIRST AS A QUESTION OFF DO WE FEEL THAT THAT'S FEATURED THAT IS BENEFICIAL AT ALL FOR MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO HALF THE PURELY PRAGMATICALLY. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT. LAKE. IT WOULD BE READING THAT MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS WOULD BE BETTER AT IF THEY WERE TO DO THAT OR NOT AND SO THAT'S ONE QUESTION. THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHETHER -- THE EFFORT OFF US BEING THE GATEKEEPERS TO WHAT DATA IT HAS ACCESS TO IS SOMETHING THAT'S PROHIBITIVE IN TERMS OF COST AND SO FAR THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM NOW. SO GET KEEPING OUR HAVING DATA IN A WAY THAT MACHINE LEARNING MODELS AND MODELS CAN INGEST IS NOT THE THE PROHIBITIVE PART OF THE BY. SO IN TERMS OF MEDICAL HISTORY. WE TALKED ABOUT MAKING MEDICAL HISTORY AVAILABLE. ONLINE AND PATIENT RIGHT RATHER THAN IT BEING IN PAPER FORM. IS THAT AN EXAMPLE THAT THE MORE YOU CONCENTRATE. MEDICAL HISTORY. THEN YOU HAVE A UNIVERSE THAT CAN CREATE INPUTS. AND FROM THAT. ON THAT UNIVERSE -- THEN WE CAN HAVE A AYE OUTPUTS. FOR DIAGNOSIS AND STUFF LIKE THAT -- YES SO TO THAT WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE WHERE YOU WOULD CREATE THE UNIVERSE THAT THE A LIVES. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT SHOULD STILL HAVE ACCESS TO ANY INFORMATION NETWORKS OUTSIDE OF THE THE COLLECTION OF THE PATIENT HAD TO COURTS. YEAH RIGHT YEAH AND AND SO SO FAR THE DATA IS READY. SORT OF P. FORMATTED WHEN IT'S GIVEN TO MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEM THAT ARE SORT OF PIPELINES THAT SORT OF THE DATA GOES THROUGH. AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE OKAY IF ANY THAT OPPORTUNITY GOES OUT TO THE INTERNET AND TRIES -- TO PRESS -- TWO DO THINGS WITH IT. AT THE MOST PROMINENT EXAMPLE I CAN THINK OFF WHICH IS SOMEWHAT RELATED IS THIS MICROSOFT THE EIGHTY CHAD PART WHICH CAME A COUPLE YEARS AGO. WHERE WHAT THEY DID WAS IT WAS JUST A JOB PORTAL OF THING WHICH IS LIKE A TWITTER ACCOUNT? THANK YOU CAN CONVERSE WITH. AND INSTEAD OF JUST CONVERSING IT HAD THIS MODE OF BEING ABLE TO LEARN FROM WHAT THE PEOPLE WERE. TALKING TO IT AND SO IN THAT SENSE. OF PEOPLE'S QUICKLY FIGURED OUT THAT IF THERE WAS CERTAIN WAYS THAT YOU TALK TO THE AGENT -- YOU COULD GET IT TO REPRODUCE WHAT DO YOU SAY. TO THE THE CHART PART -- AND THEN CLEARLY WHEN YOU DO THAT ON THE INTERNET THE JOB BOARD RESULTED IN SORT OF SORT OF LANGUAGE THAT MICROSOFT WASN'T PROUD OFF SPACES. AND I'M THEY SHUT IT DOWN AND EVERYTHING SO -- ANY EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT IF YOU SORT OF DON'T CONTROL WHAT DATA CLOSING THINGS CAN GO HERE FOR A WIRE PRETTY QUICKLY -- PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE SORT OF EXAMPLES AND GIVING YOU EVEN IF YOU DO GIVE IT CLEAN DATA THAT OUR PATENTS IT CAN FIND. OF WHEN YOU LET IT GO OUT ON THE INTERNET YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER. WHAT THE HUSKY EXAMPLE? IF YOU WERE PROGRAM THAT AGAIN NOW KNOWING THAT YOU SAW THAT IT PICKED UP ON SNOW. YOUR NEXT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE NEXT TO PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE THAT YOU'RE GONNA PUT INTO THE SYSTEM. IS DO NOT LOOK AT EXTERNALITIES. ONLY LOOK AT THE PRINCIPLE. THAT IS YES -- BUT THAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE YEAH LIKE MAYBE WILL TAKE CARE OF THE SNOW BUT MAYBE TO PICK UP ON SOMETHING ELSE THAT BE DID IN TWO DAYS STRAIGHT -- MAYBE TO SOME OTHER BUTTON AND THE IN THE IMAGE THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE THOSE SKY COLOR CODED -- YEAH AND YOU KNOW WHAT IS PRIMARY WHAT IS BACKED OFF AND WELL THANK YOU OF TAXING AND AS SOME OF YOU KNOW -- YOU SEE I LAW SCHOOLS WORKING WITH US -- IN THE STUDENTS OF THE LAW SCHOOL ALONG WITH FORMER SENATOR JOE DONE -- IN TERMS OF CRAFTING LEGISLATION THAT HAS RELEVANCE TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND WHERE WE GO AS A POLICYMAKERS HERE. OF AN EARLIER VERSION OF THE AGENDA HEAD SENATOR DONE TESTIFYING SIR FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE HERE AND LISTENING AND ARE HERE ONLY BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HEAR FORMER SENATOR JOE DONE -- I'M SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU HE WON'T BE ABLE TO ATTEND TODAY'S HEARING. BUT THANK YOU AND YOU CAN GIVE OUR REGARDS THE FOLKS AT UCI FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. IN THE NEXT -- UP WE HAVE DOCTOR GREEN A CHILD. DOCTOR CHAO OF LEADS GOOGLE'S GLOBAL PUBLIC POLICY STRATEGY FOR EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES WHICH INCLUDES ARTIFICIAL. QUANTUM COMPUTER COMPUTING AND HEALTH FRIDAY GOOGLE DOCTOR CHARLES SERVED AS A WHITE HOUSE FELLOW THE OFFICE OF SCIENCE. AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY WORK HAS BEEN PUBLISHED IN SEVERAL PEER REVIEWED JOURNALS AND RECOGNIZE WITH AWARDS FOR THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION. AND THE MATERIALS RESEARCH SOCIETY. SHE HOLDS A B. S. IN CHEMISTRY FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND A PHD IN NANO TECHNOLOGY FROM UC BERKELEY. DR CHARLES GOING TO TELL US ABOUT SOME OF THE EXCITING THINGS INDUSTRY LEADERS LEADERS ARE DOING IN THE FIELD OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. SOME OF CHALLENGES FACING A AYE IN THE INDUSTRY BEHIND IT IN AND I'LL ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTIONS I ASKED. OF DOCTOR SAYING ABOUT AT THE END ABOUT WHAT YOU MOST EXCITED ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IN IN YOU SHOULD BEAR IN MIND. OF THAT TO TARGET TO LAWYERS SO LEASE THAT SUITS HERE IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR CHAO WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE SOUNDS GREAT AND THANKS MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATOR GLAD TO BE HERE WITH YOU. I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT TODAY ABOUT A AYE AYE FROM A GOOGLE PERSPECTIVE HOW WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IT FROM THE COMPANY. I'M DOCTOR SEEING WENT OVER A LOT OF THE ORIGINAL AND KIND OF THE BASICS OF HOW THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS IF YOU LOOK AT THIS FIRST SLIDE HERE YOU CAN SEE. ON OUR DEFINITION THAT THE COMPANY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS JUST THIS LARGER SENSE OF THE SCIENCE OF MAKING THINGS SMART YOU COULD IMAGINE YOU COULD PROGRAM A COMPUTER RIGHT WITH THE DICTIONARY YOUR CALCULATOR ENCYCLOPEDIA. THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED SMART WITHIN NOT AND WE SEE A SUBSET THAT WE ARE CALLING MACHINE LEARNING ITS TECHNIQUES TO LEARN FROM DATA SO INSTEAD OF BEING HAND PROGRAM IT'S AS DR SINGH SAID TEACHING COMPUTERS TO LEARN FROM EXAMPLES -- YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THINGS LIKE WOLF AND HUSKY AND MANY OTHER DIFFERENT. THE REASON THIS IS BEEN SO IMPORTANT TO US ACT GOOGLE IS FOR THE REASON ON THE NEXT SLIDE MACHINE LEARNING SKILLS BETTER THAN RULE BASED CODE. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE FLAGSHIP GOOGLE PRODUCT GOOGLE SEARCH AYE IT'S CHANGED A LOT IN THE LAST FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS. IF YOU DID A SEARCH LET'S SAY FIFTEEN YEARS AGO PEOPLE USED TO SEARCH FOR THINGS LIKE WATER OR COFFEE. AND AND YOU KNOW YOU WOULD GET A RESULTS I'M TEN BLUE LINKS A LOT OF THAT WAS HAND CODED -- PROGRAMS BEHIND THE RESULTS RIGHT SO IF USER SEARCHES FOR WATER THEN SHOW THESE TYPES OF WEEKS RIGHT IF USER SEARCHES FOR COFFEE ENSURE THESE TYPES OF THINGS THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE TODAY. AND PEOPLE ARE SEARCHING IT IN MANY MORE LANGUAGES THAN ENGLISH FOR EXAMPLE SO TO HAND PROGRAM THINGS IN HUNDREDS OF LANGUAGES WOULD BE HUNDREDS OF TIMES MORE WORK -- PEOPLE ARE ALSO SEARCHING FOR A LOT HARDER QUESTIONS THEY'RE NO LONGER JUST SEARCHING FOR COFFEE THEY'RE SEARCHING FOR COFFEE SHOP NEAR ME RATED MORE THAN FOUR STARS GOOD VIBE. YOU COULD NEVER ACTUALLY. AND PROGRAM ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF ANSWERS INTO SEARCH ENGINE AND IN FACT TODAY MORE THAN 15% OF SEARCHES EVERY SINGLE DAY OUR UNIQUE THEIR COMPLETELY NEW GOOGLE'S NEVER SEEN BEFORE SO WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE. PREVIOUS METHODS OF HAND CODING -- THE THIRD PIECE WHICH IS INTERESTING IS THE INTERNET TODAY IS NO LONGER JUST TEXT A LOT OF IT IS. AND VIDEO IMAGES SOUNDS MUSIC AND AUDIO OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT SO AGAIN WE HAVE TO MOVE TO MACHINE LEARNING AS A COMPANY IT SCALES BETTER THAN RULE BASED CODE HELPS US TO DR ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS USERS ARE LOOKING. FOR ON THE NEXT PAGE YOU'LL SEE A FEW DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF HOW PEOPLE ARE USING MACHINE LEARNING AGAIN DOCTOR SEEING REFERRED TO YOU I'M THIS IDEA OF COMPUTATION. ON THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATHEMATICAL MODELS LIKE SOME RICE TO COUPLE HERE ALGORITHMS TO CIRCLE MODELS AND THEN ONE OF THE MOST COMMON WHICH YOU MAY HAVE BEEN HEARING INCREASING ABOUT IT'S CALLED NEURAL NETS -- NEURAL NETS LEARN FROM EXAMPLES. IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE AGAIN SIMILAR TO WHAT DOCTOR SING TALKED ABOUT YOU CAN TRAIN NEURAL NETS TO LEARN FROM MANY MANY DIFFERENT EXAMPLES. I'M IN EACH OF THE CIRCLES THAT YOU SEE HERE ON THE SLIDES REPRESENT ONE MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS SO COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE AT FIVE OR DIVIDE BY THREE YOUR TAKE A DERIVATIVE. I'M CENTURY YOU'VE GOT INPUTS TO LEARN FROM ON THE LEFT SIDE YOU'VE GOT AN IMAGE OF A CAT IT'S LABELED CAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE OUTPUT IS IT YOU WANT AN OUTSIDE. YOU CAN CONSTRAIN MODEL TO TRY TO KEEP UPDATING WHAT THOSE MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS ARE SO THAT IT CAN ALSO PROPERLY FIT DOG IN CAR APPLE. ON FLOWER YOU CAN GO THROUGH MILLIONS OF THESE EXAMPLES AND THEN WHEN YOU SHOW THE AND MACHINE LEARNING MODEL SOME NEW IMAGE HASN'T SEEN BEFORE HOPEFULLY ALL OF THE OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN CONFIGURED SUCH THAT YOU GET THE CORRECT OUTPUT ON THE END. IF NOT YOU GO BACK AND TRY TO EXAMINE WHAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED INTRIGUED. I'M FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW IT GOOGLE MACHINE LEARNING REALLY REQUIRES FOUR INGREDIENTS ONE OF THEM THE MOST OBVIOUS AGAIN DR SINGH TALKED ABOUT THIS IS TRAINING EXAMPLES SO YOU KNOW IMAGES WHICH HAVE LABELS LIKE CATS THIS IS WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD CALL DATA. HOWEVER THAT IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT'S NEEDED FOR MACHINE LEARNING IT'S JUST ONE OF THE FOUR SO ON THE RIGHT YOU'LL SEE ALGORITHMS AND TOOLS SO WHAT THOSE MATHEMATICAL MODELS LOOK LIKE ALMOST JUST AS IMPORTANT IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN HAVING THE DATA. YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE TOOLS TO LEARN FROM THE DATA. I'M ON THE BOTTOM LEFT YOU'LL SEE COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AT THIS HAS REALLY IMPROVED OVER THE LAST -- ESPECIALLY A FEW YEARS BUT OVER THE LAST DECADE AND THESE ARE COMPUTER CHIPS YOU KNOW YOU MAY BECOME FAMILIAR WITH CPUS OR GPUS NOW THERE'S A LOT OF COMPANIES WORKING TO MAKE. NEW NEXT GENERATION COMPUTER CHIPS THAT CAN SPECIFICALLY PROCESS THE MATH THAT'S NEEDED FOR NEURAL NETS SO NEURAL NETS USE A LOT OF MATRIX MULTIPLICATION THAT'S EXPENSIVE AND THAT TAKES A LONG TIME ON CPUS AND GPUS. ON THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING ON AT GOOGLE AND OTHER PLACES TO MAKE CHIPS THAT CAN HANDLE SPECIFICALLY THAT TYPE OF NOTHING BE VERY EFFICIENT THOUGHT IT. I'M WHICH IS NOW ENABLING HUGE GROWTHIN MACHINE LEARNING -- THE LAST PIECE HERE'S CREATIVITY AND INGENUITY. SENATOR BORDERS YOU TOUCHED A LITTLE BIT ON THIS BUT BEHIND ANY MODEL YOU REALLY DO NEED THE EVEN THAT ARE DESIGNING WHAT EXACTLY DOES THIS MODEL DO YOU HOW DOES IT PERFORM WHAT ARE THE INTERESTING WAYS. ON THAT IT CAN LEARN. AND SO TALENT IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL TO BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP MACHINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGY. AGAIN FROM GOOGLE PERSPECTIVE A I IS USED ACROSS GOOGLE PRODUCTS SO I JUST LISTED FIFTEEN YEAR AND THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE'RE USING MACHINE LEARNING IN ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS TALKED ABOUT SEARCH. BUT WE COULD GO INTO ANY OF THESE IN DETAILS REALLY TRANSFORMING OUR ABILITY. TO CREATE NEW THINGS DESIGN NEW FEATURES WELL EVEN THOUGH WE THINK WORKS ON A LOT OF IMPORTANT PROBLEMS IT'S REALLY ONLY A FRACTION OF THE PROBLEMS THAT EXIST IN THE WORLD SO THERE ARE. MANY DIFFERENT. OPENS THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE CARE ABOUT IN THE WORLD AND WE'RE ACTUALLY STARTING TO SEE THE USE OF A I AND MACHINE LEARNING TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THOSE PROBLEMS. RIGHT SO TOP LEFT YOU'VE GONE IMAGE OF AN AYE WE'RE SEEING DOCTORS STARTING TO USE MACHINE LEARNING FOR DIAGNOSIS ON THIS HERE IS A CASE OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY. DOCTORS USING IMAGES TO SEE WHETHER PATIENT HAS EARLY SIGNS OF BLINDNESS THAT COMES WITH DIABETES I'M WERE SEEN USE OF THIS FOR CANCER HEART DISEASE -- MEAN DISEASE'S AXE RAISE AND MANY OTHER THINGS THE NEXT PHOTO WE'VE GOT ON LOTS OF DIFFERENT FARMERS AGRICULTURE -- NEW COMMUNITIES WITH AT LOOKING BACK HOUSE AND CATTLE AND SHEEP AT A LOTS OF DIFFERENT -- PLACES IN WHICH FARMERS ARE USING MACHINE LEARNING TO PREDICT BASS CONDITIONS FOR THEIR FARMS INCREASE EFFICIENCY I'M INCREASE EFFECTIVENESS INCREASE THE HEALTH OF THEIR ANIMALS. I'M CONSERVATION. RAIN FOREST SPACE EXPLORATION AND THEN ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE ACTUALLY FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS SO THEY'RE USING MACHINE LEARNING AND TO BETTER PREDICT TRAFFIC FLOW AND BETTER MONITOR AND BETTER -- IDENTIFY. WAYS TO IMPROVE TRAFFIC ON THEIR STREETS THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT HUMAN CAN BE USED FOR PUBLIC SERVICES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. NUMBER SPOKE TO THIS A LITTLE BIT. I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DETAIL -- YOU MENTION THIS CENTER I'M BURKE BUT AT YOU KNOW THEY'RE LIKE ANY TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE AMAZING OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE ALSO RISKS THAT COME WITH THE TECHNOLOGY. I'M WE'VE EXPERIENCES THAT GOOGLE OURSELVES EVEN AS WE'VE BEEN DESIGNING YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF NEW FEATURES AND PRODUCTS AND ALL THESE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE SEE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT QUESTIONS COME UP. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING OR HOW WE SHOULD DESIGN A CERTAIN FEATURE. SO I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE. LAST YEAR WE WERE APPROACHED BY A HOSPITAL A HOSPITAL THAT TAKES CARE OF A LOT OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE A CONDITION CALLED IPHONEA. SO I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THIS BEFORE LAST YEAR BUT A PHONY AS A CONDITION. WHERE PEOPLE? FOR ACCIDENT OR OTHER HAVE LOST THE ABILITY TO SPEAK SO THEY CAN STILL THINK AND THEY CAN STILL THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY BUT WHEN THEY MOVE THEIR MOUTH. NO SOUND IS COMING OUT. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS IS REALLY FRUSTRATING. CONDITION THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS THE HOSPITAL CAME TO US AND SAID HEY WE HEARD GOOGLE IS DOING A LOT OF WORK WITH. A MACHINE LEARNING WITH TEXT TO SPEECH WE WONDER IF YOU COULD USE AB YOU KNOW YOUR TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP A NEURAL NET MODEL THAT COULD AUTOMATICALLY READ LIPS. THIS WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR PATIENTS IN THAT INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW HAVING TO SIGN OR WRITE OR TYPE OR SPEAK THROUGH YOU KNOW COMPUTERIZED VOICE. THEY COULD ACTUALLY JUST MAKE THEIR MOUTH SAY WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WOULD KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. WELL WE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS BECAUSE OF COURSE ON FIRST BLUSH% WHO DOESN'T WANT TO HELP THESE KIND OF PATIENTS RIGHT THAT'S AN AMAZING USE CASE. SOMETHING THAT I'M YOU WOULD REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR LOVED ONES. HOWEVER YOU COULD ALSO IMAGINE KIND OF GOING ONE STEP FURTHER A LOT OF CHALLENGES AROUND THAT WHO HAS ACCESS TO THIS TECHNOLOGY WHO'S ABLE TO READ THIS PERSON'S LIPS. WHAT HAPPENS IF -- I DON'T KNOW LIKE A ROGUE ACTOR SOMEBODY WANTS TO SPY ON A CO WORKER FAMILY MEMBER COULD JUST HIDE A CAMERA AND THEN USE NEURAL NET MODEL TO SPY ON THEM. HOW WOULD WE CONTROL THE -- YOU KNOW SHARING OF THAT TYPE F MODEL -- WHAT HAPPENS AN EVEN LARGER SCALE WHAT ABOUT GOVERNMENTS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH GOVERNMENTS -- POWER SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK INTO LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST WALKING BY ON THE SIDEWALK -- WHAT HAPPENS IF THAT GETS INTO THE HANDS OF ROGUE GOVERNMENTS? I'M WHO HAVE INTENTIONS MAYBE EVEN AGAINST HUMAN RIGHTS SO WE DEBATED THIS A LOT INTERNALLY REALLY TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE WANTED TO DO. THIS WAS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF MANY OF THE KINDS OF CASES THAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT I'M IN THIS CASE THE WAY THAT WE ENDED UP RESOLVING IT WE DID WORK WITH THE HOSPITAL. WE DESIGNER ON THAT MODEL BUT IT ONLY WORKED FOR PATIENTS WHO WERE LOOKING DIRECTLY AT EIGHT ZERO DEGREE ANGLE SO IT WOULD NOT WORK FOR SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS THAT WERE. POSTED AT A DISTANCE AT AN ANGLE. PACIFIC WE WITH THEM AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TIME RESOLUTION AND THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION WAS SUCH THAT IT WOULD ONLY WORK FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE OPTED INTO SPEAKING OVER A WEBCAM OR INTO SPECIFIC CAMERA. WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND WE ALSO ONLY SHARE THE MODEL WITH THE HOSPITAL SO THAT'S PROJECT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM ON SPECIFICALLY TO DEVELOP -- WHILE WE PUBLISHED THE RESEARCH WE NOT PUBLISHER OPEN SOURCE MODEL SO THAT'S WAY THAT WE KIND OF ADDRESS STOCK -- BUT AS I MENTIONED THERE'S BEEN HUNDREDS OF CASES LIKE THIS AND AS A COMPANY LAST JUNE WE ACTUALLY DECIDED TO PUT TGETHER. A SET OF OUR OWN GOOGLE A AYE PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT THIS WAS OUR COMPANY'S WAY OF SETTING OUT WHAT OUR OWN ETHICAL CHARTER IS HOW WE SHOULD GUIDE OF THE RESPONSIBLE USE. OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AT THE COMPANY I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO ANY OF THESE IN MORE DETAIL ON THE LEFT YOU'LL SEE SEVEN THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT A I SHOULD DO YOU OR BE RIGHT BE SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL. AVOID CREATING A REINFORCING UNFAIR BIAS BE BUILT AND TESTED FOR SAFETY BE ACCOUNTABLE TO PEOPLE CORPORATE PRIVACY DESIGN PRINCIPLES. UPHOLD HIGH STANDARDS OF SCIENTIFIC EXCELLENCE AND THE NUMBER SEVEN BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR USES THAT ACCORD WITH THESE PRINCIPLES AGAIN HAPPY TO GO INTO THIS IN MORE DETAIL BUT THIS NUMBER SEVEN WAS REALLY AROUND THE IDEA THAT GOOGLE. WE DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONES THAT JUST CREATE THE TECHNOLOGY AND HOLD ON TO IT WE THINK LOADS OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON IMPORTANT PROBLEMS WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE TECHNOLOGY. AS LONG AS THEY'RE DOING SO IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER SO WE'VE RELEASED A LOT OF DIFFERENT. I'M OPEN SOURCE MODELS TOOLS OUR OWN MACHINE LEARNING LIBRARY TENSER FLOW WHICH WE USE FOR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT WE COMPLETELY OPEN SOURCE LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE. OUTSIDE CAN USE IT ON THE RIGHT YOU'LL SEE FOR APPLICATIONS THAT WE WILL NOT PURSUE. ANY THAT ARE LIKELY TO CAUSE OVERALL HARM PRINCIPLE PURPOSE IS TO DIRECT INJURY SURVEILLANCE VIOLATING INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED NORMS AND THE NUMBER FOUR AND THOSE WHOSE PURPOSE. CONTRAVENES INTERNATIONAL LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS THIS IS THE SET OF PRINCIPLES THAT WE HAVE BEEN USING -- OVER THE LAST. YEAR YEAR AND A FEW WEEKS I'M TO REALLY ASSESS EVERY SINGLE CASE EVERY FEATURE EVERY PRODUCT EVERY RESEARCH PAPER THAT WE GET OUT TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE LIVING UP TO THE COMMITMENTS WE'VE SET UP. OF COURSE IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY THERE ARE CASES WHERE SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES COME INTO CONFLICT RIGHT EVERYBODY WANTS FAIRNESS EVERYBODY WANTS PRIVACY EVERYONE WANTS ACUITY BUT THERE ARE PLACES WHERE YOU NEED TO MAKE TRADE OFFS. AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGING ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH OVER THE PAST YEAR. LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT A AYE BIAS I DO WANT TO MAKE THIS ONE POINT HERE THAT A I CAN ALSO HELP YOU MEANS TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE. AND SO THE GINA DAVIS INSTITUTE CAME TO US A FEW YEARS AGO GINA DAVIS HAD A HUNCH THAT WOMEN ARE UNDER REPRESENTED IN FILM AND MEDIA SHE SAID. HEY YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS A LONG TIME I FEEL LIKE WOMEN HAVE LESS SCREEN TIME IF YOU LIKE WOMEN HAVE LESS SPEAKING TIME THEY'RE NOT TREATED FAIRLY. HOWEVER I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PUT MY FINGER ON I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO QUANTIFY EXACTLY WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE WE PARTNER TOGETHER BUILDING MACHINE LEARNING MODEL THAT CAN AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY FACES OF MEN AND AUTOMATICALLY IDENTIFY FACES OF WOMEN. WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE GINA DAVIS INSTITUTE OUR MODEL WATCHED THOSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MOVIES AND ACTUALLY DOCUMENTED WHEN A MAN WAS ON STAGE WHEN A WOMAN WAS ON STAGE AND WHEN THEY WERE SPEAKING. THAT SOMETHING THAT NO PERSON WOULD BE ABLE TO DO NO ONE'S GOING TO SIT THERE AND YOU KNOW BOX AND LABEL ALL THESE DIFFERENT TIMES FOR MILLIONS OF HOURS OF FOOTAGE. WE SHOULD -- WITH THE GENE DAVIS INSTITUTE WAS THAT MEN IN FACT DO YOU HAVE MUCH MORE SCREEN AND SPEAKING TIME ABOUT SEVENTY TO THIRTY AND IN FACT IN THE NEXT STEP BEYOND THAT. AT FILMS THAT HAD WOMEN IN 50% OR MORE OF THE SCREEN AND SPEAKING TIME DID BETTER AT THE BOX OFFICE. SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT GINA DAVIS AND HER TEAM COULD ACTUALLY TAKE TWO STUDIOS ON TO TRY TO PROMOTE WOMEN MORE IN MEDIA. I IT'S AN EXAMPLE THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING SO WANTED TO POINT OUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES HERE. TO MAKE US BETTER. LAST PAGE JUST TO GIVE YOU A SNEAK PREVIEW OF HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT A I AT THE COMPANY WHAT'S COMING NEXT FROM US. THERE'S REALLY THREE MAIN AREAS THAT WERE WORKING IN NUMBER ONE CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH NUMBER TWO APPLICATIONS. NUMBER THREE HUMAN A AYE INTERACTION SO IN NOT CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH AREA I LISTED SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLACES I'LL CALL OUT A FEW. NUMBER ONE SMALL DATA WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT LEARNING FROM BIG DATA FROM EXAMPLES MILLIONS OF PHOTOS THAT KIND OF THING. HOWEVER THERE ARE A LOT OF CASES IN THE WORLD YOU'VE GOT VERY. RARE SEARCH QUERIES FOR RARE DISEASES OR RARE LANGUAGES NO AS HUMANS WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO LEARN FROM JUST A SMALL NUMBER OF EXAMPLES YOU LOOK AT A THREE YEAR OLD A FOUR YEAR OLD. THEY CAN PROBABLY SEE FOR FIRE TRUCKS MAYBE FIVE FIRE TRUCKS IN THE AUTOMATICALLY NOTIFIED TRUCK IS THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH GOING ON AT OUR COMPANY AS WELL AS OTHERS INTO HOW CAN WE BUILD BETTER MODELS THAT CAN LEARN FROM SMALL DATA EXAMPLES. THIS IS GREAT FOR THOSE RARE CASES IT'S ALSO GREAT FOR PRIVACY IT'S GREAT FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS -- AND YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY THE RESEARCH IS STILL. INCIPIENT SO JUST IN ITS EARLY DAYS BUT IT IS A PROMISING ON AREA THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING INTO LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING MACHINE PERCEPTION BEING ABLE TO LOOKAT A SCENE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE YOU CAN IMAGINE LOADS OF ACCESSIBILITY AS WELL AS OTHER REASONS WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT. IN TERMS OF UP WITH. ACROSS THE BOARD INSIDE THE COMPANY WE'RE LOOKING -- ACROSS BUSINESS SCIENCE HEALTH MUSIC OUR PUBLIC SERVICES PARTNERING IN COLLABORATING WITH EXPERTS IN ALL OF THOSE AREAS ACROSS SECTORS AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENT. SECTORS IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD USING MACHINE LEARNING FOR THE SECTORS AND MORE SO WE'RE ALSO DOING OUR BEST TO CREATE TOOLS THAT THOSE. PEOPLE CAN USE. AND KIND OF RUN WITH. ON THE LAST PIECE YOU'LL SEE HIM IN A AYE INTERACTION -- IVORY IN HERE INTERFACE EASE OF USE WHY PARTICIPATION THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SEEMS REALLY IMPORTANT. THE LAST THING THAT WE WOULD WANT IS FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY WHICH YOU KNOW ON ITS FACE MAY SOUND COMPLICATED TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS BEEN RELEGATED JUST TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERTISE AND INCREASINGLY OTHER PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS IT OR HAVE USE. OF IT I'M WE THINK IT'S CRUCIAL FOR THERE TO BE WHY PARTICIPATION EDUCATION HAPPY TO GO INTO A LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES. INTERFACE HAVE WRITTEN HERE YOU KNOW MOST OF US IN THIS ROOM WE CAN PROBABLY DRIVE A CAR BUT MOST OF US DON'T KNOW HOW TO BUILD A CAR. I THINK THAT'S A SIMILAR ANALOGY THAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WITH MACHINE LEARNING MODELS WE THINK THEY'RE VERY POWERFUL. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING INTO WHAT SHOULD THOSE HUMAN COMPUTER INTERFACES LOOK LIKE SO A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN OPERATE MACHINE LEARNING MODELS. EVEN IF THEY DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW HOW TO BUILD THEM -- SO I'LL LEAVE IT THERE I THINK THERE'S A TON OF DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON TOGETHER THANKS. THANK YOU DOCTOR CHAO A MOST INTERESTING AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE HAVE T BE IN MANY PLACES AT THE SAME TIME. AND I AM THOáT SENATOR ALSO ALSO HAS TO BE MANY PLEASE STAND UP BUT I'M SORRY YOU WERE HERE FOR DOCTOR CHARLES TESTIMONY ABOUT THE BIAS -- WITH RESPECT TO THE FILM INDUSTRY IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING. ALL OF US ARE INTERESTED IN YOU MAY WANT TO TALK TO DOCTOR CHAO ABOUT OF WHAT ONE OF THE CONCERNS AND I THINK IT'S A GENERAL CONCERN. IS TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF THE COLLECTION ANALYSIS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND AND MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT I REALIZE THAT FOR EXAMPLE GOOGLE OR OTHER ENTITIES. NO YOU YOU YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T REVEAL TRADE SECRETS BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN -- REVEAL. OF FOR EXAMPLE WHAT WHAT KIND OF TRANSPARENCY WILL BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS -- INTERFACING WITH WITH GOOGLE YEAH DEFINITELY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE TALK ABOUT. A LOT YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MODELS AT GOOGLE WE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT DOES THE OPTIMAL TRANSPARENCY LOOK LIKE IN OUR A. I. PRINCIPLES WE'VE STATED. AS NUMBER FOR A I SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE AND WITHIN THAT ACCOUNTABILITY WE WOULD CONSIDER EXPLAIN ABILITY TRANSPARENCY AS WELL AS THE NEED AND AND THE ABILITY FOR SOMEBODY. TO CONTEST YOU KNOW THE KIND OF ANSWER PRODUCTION COMING FROM MODEL. I'M SO THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOOK AT IT YOU MENTIONED AND TRADE SECRETS OF COURSE THAT IS SOMETHING THERE'S PROPRIETARY CONCERNS YOU KNOW WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THAT. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT OTHER PIECES IN IT TOO IF YOU THINK ABOUT SEARCH SEARCH MODEL FOR EXAMPLE. AND IF YOU WERE TO SHOW THE EXACT COMPLETE MODEL I'M WE HAVE YOU KNOW NO DOUBT THAT PEOPLE WOULD USE THAT AND TRY TO HACK THE SYSTEM. SO WE TALK ABOUT PRIVACY RE TALK ABOUT SECURITY YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMEBODY ACTUALLY HACKED THAT MODEL AND MADE ON YOU KNOW DIFFERENT RESULTS OF YOUR AN EARLIER OR LATER. I'M ACTUALLY TRYING. TO MAYBE I'VE DISRUPTS TRANSLATION FOR GOOGLE TRANSLATE OR YOU KNOW VIDEOS FOR YOU TO BURKE OR ANY OF THE LIKE SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT WE THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE PROTECT PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF OUR MODELS THINK ABOUT RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT. WHILE ALSO BEING AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE ANOTHER I DID MENTION THAT WE THINK ABOUT IS WHAT IS THE MOST USEFUL FOR THE USER. SO WE TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE'VE HEARD I'M PEOPLE CALL FOR ME HAD THESE DISCUSSIONS INTERNALLY ALSO WHAT IF YOU KNOW FOR GOOGLE TRANSLATE WE JUST PUBLISHED THE FULL SOURCE CODE AND MEAN ABLE PEOPLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT NOW BE COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT. WELL TO MOST PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY USELESS THEY WOULDN'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND WHAT ANY OF THAT SOURCE COULD MEAN THAT'S NOT REALLY GETTING THEM TO THE ANSWERS THAT THEY WANT. ON THE ALSO THINK ABOUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR DIFFERENT USER SO AS WE'RE STARTING TO PARTNER A LOT WITH CLINICIANS POSITIONS. HOSPITAL THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF EXPLANATIONS WHAT KIND OF TRANSPARENCY DO DOCTORS NEED IN ORDER TO TRUST AND ANSWER I'M AT HOW'S THAT DIFFERENT FROM PATIENTS HOW'S THAT DIFFERENT FROM NURSES OR TECHNICIANS OR MAYBE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN. DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR DIFFERENT. I'M PEOPLE SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN I'M THINKING A LOT ABOUT AND IN THE CASE OF AT HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY OR TRANSPORTATION OR OTHERS WE ACTUALLY THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL TO BE WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATORS REGULATORS EXPERTS IN THOSE -- YOU KNOW WHEN HEALTH CARE FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE UP TO GOOGLE IT'S NOT OUR RESPONSIBILITY BUT ALSO NOT OUR EXPERTISE TO SAY DOCTOR SHOULD KNOW THIS AND PATIENTS SHOULD KNOW THIS AND TECHNICIANS KNOW THIS RIGHT BUT WE'VE GOT TO WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY. WHAT ARE THOSE CRUCIAL ASPECTS OF TRANSPARENCY THAT NEED TO BE KNOWN HOW CAN WE TRY TO BUILD MODELS THAT CAN SHOW THAT BECAUSE DR SINGH SAID IT'S NOT PERFECT WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW EXACTLY WHY MODELS ARE PREDICTING THINGS THEY DO -- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING INTO THAT SO HOW COULD WE I'M KIND OF BEST DESIGN MODELS IN THAT WAY. ON THE LAST POINT I'LL TOUCH ON IN THIS IS RELATED -- TO BILL THAT YOU. OPPOSE CENTER ON BURKE IS THIS IDEA OF HOW CAN WE BE MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT THE MODEL OR WHAT THE DATA SETS ARE ACTUALLY COMPRISED OF AND WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING. ON NEW WE CALL THESE DATA CARDS WERE MODEL CARDS AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE CALLED THEM NUTRITION LABELS FOR DATASETS OR NUTRITION LABELS FOR MODELS SO THE SAME WAY AS YOU CAN SAY THIS HAS YOU KNOW AX GRAMS OF FAT OR SUGAR. OR VITAMIN A AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO TRY TO SAY OKAY FOR THESE DATA SETS THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM YOU LET'S SAY IT'S AN IMAGE DATA SET WHAT PERCENTAGE ARE ANIMALS WHAT PERCENTAGE OUR CARS WHAT PERCENTAGE OUR FOOD JUST TO GIVE PEOPLE A SENSE OF WHAT'S INSIDE. WHERE DID THE DATA COME FROM OKAY IT'S 60% AND 40% WOMEN YOU KNOW 60% FROM THE U. S. 40% FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD? AND WE'VE BEEN REALLY WORKING TO TRY TO PUT TOGETHER THESE% NUTRITION LABELS WE'VE TESTED A FEW ALREADY WE PUBLISHED. ONE ONLINE FOR AN IMAGE DATA SET THAT WE HAVE AND WE'RE REALLY WORKING TO DO MORE IN THAT AREA THE SAME THING FOR MODEL'S WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS AT LEAST A GOOD START TO PROVIDING SOME TRANSPARENCY. SO FOR THESE MODELS HOW DO THEY WORK WHAT IS THEIR PERFORMANCE ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF POPULATIONS WHAT IS THEIR PERFORMANCE I'M YOU KNOW WHAT IS THEIR ERROR RATES -- WHERE DOES THE MODEL FEEL WE'RE SHOULD PROBABLY NOT BE USED ON WE'VE GOTTEN ONE EXAMPLE AS WELL OF A MODEL CARD WHICH WE POSTED ONLINE WE'RE LOOKING TO DO MANY MORE? WE'VE GOT A TEST THESE IDEAS BECAUSE WE ALSO DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE GOT ALL THE RIGHT CATEGORIES ARE ALL THE RIGHT INFORMATION ON BUT WE THINK. MAY NOT INDUSTRY COULD REALLY MOVE TOWARDS SO -- IT AND WE DON'T NEED TO GET INTO THIS TODAY BUT ALL THREE OF US SIT ON JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE WRESTLING WITH THIS PRIVACY TRANSPARENCY. THE RELATIONSHIP SO I I KNOW THAT GOOGLE'S ALREADY AWARE OF OF OUR INTEREST IN. OUR COLLECTIVE CONCERNED SO -- ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS. IS THE SERVER JUST INCIDENT WHEN SENATOR RUSSELL. YOU KNOW I THINK -- PREVIOUS CAPACITIES OF COME TO KIND OF PUSH IT DIFFERENT ROLES THAT GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY HAVE -- AB AT AT FIRST BLUSH MIGHT LOOK UPON INDUSTRY AS A PROFIT MOTIVE A MOTIVATED -- ADVANCE ADVANCING THE AREAS STUDY OR LEARNING -- GOVERNMENTS HOWEVER HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF PRIORITIES -- STRATEGIC BEING ONE OF THEM. AND SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. DO YOU DOES GOOGLE HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW. THE LEGISLATURE OR THE CITY CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE EXECUTIVE. CAN LISTEN TO WHAT ARE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF INDUSTRY WE'VE HEARD FROM A LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION SO ON AND SO FORTH. HOW DOES CALIFORNIA HOW DOES AMERICA BUT SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA? HOW DO WE CATCH UP TO WHERE WE SHOULD BE WHERE WE WANT TO BE? DâN. ARE THERE CERTAIN REGULATIONS THAT ARE BETTER CREATING -- DIFFICULTY ARE THERE CERTAIN INDUSTRY INCENTIVES. AND COORDINATION -- THAT -- WE CAN BE A PART OF ANY VERY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS YES AND AND WE'VE ACTUALLY WRITTEN A PAPER ON THIS SO HAPPY TO SHARE THAT. I WAS CAN YOU AFTERWARDS IT'S GOT A LOT OF DETAILS IN THERE -- I WOULD SAY -- IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC I'LL JUST NAME THREE RIGHT HERE ON THE FIRST IS REALLY IN TERMS OF CALIFORNIA INVESTING CATCHING UP I'M REALLY AND I THINK BEING ABLE TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS IN STUDENTS. I AND AND YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S K. THROUGH TWELVE AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL. OR EVEN AT THE GRADUATE LEVEL AND WHAT DO THOSE INVESTMENTS LOOK LIKE WHAT ARE THE RIGHT TYPES OF EDUCATION THAT STUDENTS SHOULD BE LEARNING WE THINK OF COURSE TEMAS IMPORTANT COMPUTER SCIENCE IS IMPORTANT. AND YOU KNOW MACHINE LEARNING IS IMPORTANT BUT EVEN MORE THE ABILITY TO LEARN TO LEARN THE ABILITY TO ADOPT WHAT DO THE SPECIFIC COURSEWORK LOOK LIKE I'M NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE OUTLINED IN IN. HE TELLS YOU AS USEFUL IN TERMS OF NUMBER TUNE TALKED ABOUT SOME REGULATIONS A BEGINNING THE WAY. AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON ON HIP A REFORM WE'VE TALKED A LOT WITH CALIFORNIA STATE AS WELL UCSF AND SOME OF THE OTHERS. YOU KNOW WITH SO MUCH PROMISE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF ROADBLOCKS IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO LEARN FROM PATIENT DATA AND IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT PATIENT DATA WALL MACHINE LEARNING MODELS ARE ABLE -- TO KIND OF SURVEY AN ENSEMBLE OF RECORDS TO MAKE BETTER PREDICTIONS FOR EVERYBODY -- COULD I THINK ALL AGREE IN LONG RUN THAT KIND OF THING WOULD BE VERY USEFUL -- TERMS OF PREDICTING DISEASE EARLIER SAVING MONEY ON PROMOTING HEALTH YOUR LIFE'S BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF NEEDS TO BE WORKED OUT THERE. AND SO I WOULD SAY LOOKING AT AT HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION LOOKING ACCESS TO DATA LOOKING AT PROTECTIONS FOR DATA WOULD BE IN THE AREA THAT. I'M IS QUITE IMPORTANT -- AND THEN THE THIRD I WOULD SAY AT IS REALLY JUST THINKING ABOUT. I'M HOW GOVERNMENTS CAN PROMOTE AND THIS CAME UP IN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOVICE AT THIS MONEY AS WELL HOW GOVERNMENTS CAN REMOTE KIND OF HEALTHY AND I GUESS ATTITUDE TOWARDS YEAH. I'M NOT YOUR BUT NOT -- YOU KNOW OVER POLLYANNA ISHE I GUESS EITHER JUST REALLY INCREASING PUBLIC PUBLIC EDUCATION SO THERE AREN'T CRAZY PRESSURES ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THING LIKE -- WERE FREED OF THIS -- OR WE DON'T WANT DAIS OR YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO GO THIS WAY I THINK LOOKING AT IT IN. AT QUITE A NUANCED WAY ON SO THAT EVERYBODY IS ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD LIKE TO SEE THAT THE YES. SHARE COPY THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR BORDERS SIR RUSSELL. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME ON THE AGENDA BUT I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ANYWAY ON A ON A FEW THINGS -- ONE IS WITH REGARDS TO THE IMPACT ON THE FUTURE WORK -- AND HOW OLD. YOUR COMMITMENT AT LEAST GOOGLE'S COMMITMENT TO BE SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL. HOW DOES THAT -- HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT PART OF BEING SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL? IS OF A WORK FORCE YEP THAT IS READY. THAT IS COMPARED. THAT IS PROACTIVELY. EDUCATED -- AND THAT SHOULD END UP IN BROAD TERMS. OF IN IN OUR SOCIETY BEAN. OF BENEFITING IN A WAY THAT'S NOT JUST. CRAMMING OUR LIVES IN WITH MORE. TECHNOLOGY WITH. I MEAN BECAUSE SEEMS LIKE THE MORE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE INSTEAD OF BECOMING A SOCIETY THAT ENJOYS LIFE MORE. WE ARE BECOMING A SOCIETY IN WHICH WERE CRAMMING MORE INTO OUR DAY -- AND IT IS A COULD BE A SOURCE OF FEAR OR IN SECURITY. FOR PEOPLE IN TERMS OF WHAT KINDS OF JOBS DOES THIS MEAN WHAT KIND OF CAREERS DOES THIS MEAN. SO INSTEAD OF IT BEING A WHAT IT IS WELCOME BUT INSTEAD OF BE WELCOME ON EVERY. IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES. IT SEEMS TO BE WELCOME BECAUSE WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY BUT ARE WE EXCITED AS FAR AS WHAT IT BRINGS TO OUR FUTURE. AS THE FUTURE CAREERS AND FUTURE WORK FORCE FUTURE NEEDS SO JUST ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT OR HOW WE COULD TACKLE THAT BECAUSE I DON'T. THINK ANYBODY HAS THE EXACT ANSWER YEAH DEFINITELY THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TEAMS NEED TO PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER. I'M FROM GOOGLE I'D SAY WE DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS A LOT YOU POINTED OUT THAT WE'VE GOT OUR PRINCIPLES WE SAY A I SHOULD BE SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL. WE ALSO POINT OUT IN OUR RED LINES OF APPLICATIONS WE WILL NOT PURSUE WE WON'T PURSUE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE LIKELY TO CAUSE OVERALL HARM WE PUT THIS ONE IN THERE IT'S QUITE. AN I THINK BROUGHT SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS AS TO CIVIC THINGS COME UP OFTENTIMES PEOPLE THINK. PHYSICAL HARM OR AND MAYBE SAFETY AT IT MAYBE M. CHEMICAL HARM THINGS LIKE THAT WE'VE ALSO INCLUDED IN THAT NOTION ECONOMIC HARM SOCIETAL HARM SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ABSOLUTELY THINK ABOUT. I JOIN GOOGLE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN IN THE FALL SO ALMOST FIVE YEARS AGO AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS CHANGED A LOT SINCE THAT TIME. WHEN I FIRST JOINED ACTUALLY ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF EVEN ENGINEERS HAD MACHINE LEARNING TRAINING I'M THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TODAY WE'VE HAD MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND ENGINEERS GO THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING TRAINING COMPANY? SO EVEN WITHIN THE MICROCOSM OF GOOGLE I SEE PEOPLE'S JOBS HAVE CHANGED YOU THE SKILLS THAT THEY'VE DEVELOPED HAVE HAD TO CHANGE AND YOU KNOW MAYBE A LOT OF TIME FIVE YEARS AGO USED TO DO A LOT OF HAND PROGRAMMING AS I WAS MENTIONING. EARLIER NOW IT'S A LOT MORE COACHING AND TRAINING AND LEARNING FROM EXAMPLE AND SO THOSE TYPES OF JOBS. HAVE CHANGED WE'VE HAD PEOPLE FROM ALL SORTS OF OTHER FUNCTIONS TO LEGALSALES BUSINESS ETCETERA I'M HAPPY WITH YOUR MACHINE LEARNING TRAINING AS WELL TO ADAPT TO THE WAY THAT -- YOU KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE COMPANY IS CHANGING I'M WE WE ANTICIPATE THIS WILL BE THE CASE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD AS WELL I THINK WE'RE ALREADY STARTING TO SEE THAT SO. WHAT ARE WAYS THAT DIFFERENT PEOPLE'S JOBS NEED TO CHANGE INSIDE THE COMPANY I MENTIONED -- WE ACTUALLY HAD AN EDUCATION TEAM THAT BUILT A MACHINE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND ENGINEERS I'M GO THROUGH. TWO YEARS AGO WE OPENED THAT COURSE UP SO ANYBODY CAN TAKE IT AND IT'S IN MORE THAN ELEVEN LANGUAGES I BELIEVE RIGHT OUT. I'M SEE EXACT SAME COURSE THAT OUR OWN AND EMPLOYEES LEARN FROM. SO WE'VE OPEN THAT UP EXTERNALLY THAT SEEM EDUCATION TEAM HAS ACTUALLY LOOKED ACROSS A WIDE VARIETY RIGHT I THINK THE FIRST COURSE WAS TARGETED TOWARDS ENGINEER SPECIFICALLY. I'M BUT WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S LOADS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA NEED TO LEARN THIS AND THEY MIGHT NOT NEED TO BE CODING INTENSE OUR FLOOR PYTHON OR ANY OF THOSE TYPES OF LANGUAGES MAYBE THEY JUST NEED TO LEARN HOW TO OPERATE SYSTEMS ARE. NEED TO LEARN THE BASIC CONCEPTS THAT KIND OF THING I'M SO WE'VE RELEASED A WHOLE SET OF MATERIALS CALLED LEARN WITH GOOGLE A AYE. ON OUR WEBSITE I'M AND WE'VE SEEN EVERYONE FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN I'M LEARNING -- FROM THE COURSES AND TAKING THEM THERE THE INTERACTIVE AND FUN ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING AT SECOND THIRD. FOURTH CAREER SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF IMPORTANCE THERE IN EDUCATION. HON YOU TALKED A BIT ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MAKE SUE THAT PEOPLE DON'T BECOME MORE OBSESSED WITH TECHNOLOGY AND MAYBE JUST MORE DRIVEN INTO PHONES AND THINGS -- I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT NEED TO COME TOGETHER THEIR ONE EXAMPLE THAT. I'M I WILL GIVE FROM A GOOGLE PERSPECTIVE THOSE WE'VE SEEN USE OF MACHINE LEARNING FOR I'M ACTUALLY I'M THE CREATIVE INDUSTRY TO SPUR I'M BETTER MUSIC AND ART OR ACTUALLY MAYBE MORE DIFFERENT MUSIC AND ART SO. WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT MUSICIANS AND THE FLAMING LIPS AND THEY'VE BEEN SAYING YOU KNOW AT TIMES AS A MUSICIAN YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT LOTS OF IDEAS WE IMPROVISE WE DO. INTERESTING THINGS BUT I'M THEIR TIMES ARE WE GET A ROADBLOCK GREAT I THINK YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS FROM WRITERS TO WRITER'S BLOCK OR ARTIST NOT SURE EXACTLY. ON WHAT THEY WANT TO DO I'M WE'VE WORKED WITH THEM TO DEVELOP MACHINE LEARNING MODELS TRAINED ON BARKER TREE NON MOZART OR MAYBE TRAIN ON FLAMING LIPS. AND SONGS OR COMBINATION ON CREATING KIND OF DIFFERENT INSTRUMENT SOUNDS THAT DON'T EXIST NOW -- BUT THEY CAN USE IT AND PLAY AROUND WITH IT TO ACTUALLY JUST GET NEW IDEAS BURKE KIND OF CREATIVITY ARE LIKE WHO I NEVER THOUGHT OF THOSE NOTES IN COMBINATION TOGETHER BEFORE THOSE INSTRUMENTS OR THAT TYPE OF RHYTHM AND THEN THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE THAT RIFF OFF OF IT. AND COME UP WITH NEW SONGS NEW PERFORMANCES AND SO I THINK THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF ON THE WAY THAT AND MAYBE THIS COULD HELP TRANSFORM A LOT OF PARTS OF SOCIETY -- WHAT SEEMS TO UNDERSCORE ALL OF IT IS YOU'VE GOT TO GET LOTS OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE INVOLVED IT CAN'T JUST BE ONE COMPANY OR ONE INDUSTRY SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE THINK THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE? EDUCATION IS A KEY PART OF THAT BUT SO IS PARTICIPATION I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS AND DIFFERENT VIEWS OF WHAT THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE IF THEY ALL HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF MACHINE LEARNING -- I THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO BUILD THAT SOCIETY AND THAT'S A BIT BETTER -- AND AGAIN WHATEVER YOU MIGHT HAVE INITIALLY AS YOUR RESPONSE AND IN ANY -- DIRECTION THAT YOU COULD GIVE US ON THIS IS. HOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS? BIG CHANGE IN OUR WORLD. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT IT IS? EQUITABLY. LEARNED AND TAUGHT. BUT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES SO IT DOESN'T BECOME SOMETHING THAT A VERY ELITE GROUP OF PEOPLE. KNOW HOW TO AND I DON'T MEAN THE USE OF IT. YEAH THE USE OF IT. EVERYBODY SEEMS TO EVEN I CAN PICK UP OF THE USE OF A LOT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY I'M TALKING ABOUT THE CREATED THE THAT CREATORS -- BECAUSE THAT'S WERE REAL STRENGTH IS YEAH IT'S IT'S NOT JUST IN THE USERS THE PASSIVE. UP PART OF IT IT'S WHAT ABOUT THE CREATOR SO. IT REALLY I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE. TO BE ESPECIALLY VIGILANT AND PRO ACTIVE. IN MAKING SURE THAT. OF THE THE FRONT END THE FRONT. PART YES -- THIS NEW LEARNING AND TECHNOLOGY AND AND AI. IS REALLY TAKEN EQUALLY OUT OUR COMMUNITIES AND THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD THIS OTHERWISE WE JUST PERPETUATING. A LOT OF YOU KNOW BAD ECONOMICS -- SEGREGATION IN YOU KNOW IN THE BIG USE OF OF THE TERM SO I GET REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- THAT. WERE JUST NOT MAKING SURE. IT'S GETTING OUT THERE AND IT'S ADVANCING SO MUCH. AND MANY COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING LEFT BEHIND MANY COUNTRIES ARE GETTING LEFT BEHIND SO. HOW DOES GOOGLE ADDRESS THAT YEAH? I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AS WELL I MENTIONED IT A LITTLE BIT EARLIER. IN MY REMARKS ON SO COUPLE OF DIFFERENT POINTS ONE IS ACTUALLY COMPARED TO EARLIER TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE EXISTED IF YOU LOOK AT AND MAYBE CHEMISTRY OR BIOTECHNOLOGY OR SOME OF THE OTHERS. AND YOU KNEW THAT THE BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT LOWER YOU DON'T ACTUALLY NEED A FANCY LAB OR ACCESS TO EXPENSIVE CHEMICALS. OR BIG MACHINES LIKE IN NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE OR OR X. RAYS ARE MICROSCOPES OR THINGS LIKE THAT THE BARRIER TO ENTRY ACTUALLY FOR ANYBODY TO LEARN HOW TO CODE IS MAYBE. A LAPTOP WERE ON A PHONE -- THERE'S LOTS OF MACHINE LEARNING MODELS ACTUALLY OPERATE DIRECTLY ON PHONE I'M WE'VE ACTUALLY I'M. L. AMONG OTHERS BEEN PUTTING OUT SOME KIND OF TOOLS THAT ARE EVEN MADE OUT OF CARDBOARD BOXES BUT HAVE A LITTLE RASPBERRY PI CIRCUIT INSIDE. EITHER FIFTY DOLLARS THEY'RE NOT FREE BUT THEY ARE SOMETHING WE'RE CALLING THEM A AYE WHY KIDS THE SAME IDEAS LIKE D. I. Y. BUT A AYE WHY SO I'M SCHOOL CHILDREN CAN ACTUALLY. BUILD THEIR OWN YOU KNOW SPEECH TO TAX OR IMAGE RECOGNITION OR THINGS LIKE THAT MODELS ON THINGS THAT ARE DONE ON PHONES OR ON COMPUTERS COULD BE VIRTUALLY FREE AS LONG AS YOU'VE GONE INTERNET CONNECTION OR ACCESS TO THE SITE SO I THINK. THE BARRIER TO ENTRY COMPARED TO PREVIOUS TECHNOLOGIES IS QUITE A BIT LOWER. THAT BEING SAID PEOPLE STILL HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT HE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT THEM -- WORK TRYING TO DO THAT THROUGH A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS I TALKED ABOUT EDUCATION AND WE'VE GOT PROGRAMS IN CLASSROOMS IN THE U. S. IN CALIFORNIA AND AND AROUND THE WORLD. AND JUST IN AT LAST OCTOBER WE ANNOUNCED A CHALLENGE CALLED THE GOOGLE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A AYE IMPACT CHALLENGE WHERE WE PROVIDED AT AN OPEN CALL TO ANYBODY AROUND THE WORLD. TO TRY TO THINK ABOUT WAYS A I COULD ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON JUST IN MAY SO JUST LAST MONTH WE ANNOUNCE THE WINNERS OF THOSE. I'M INCLUDING NINE FROM THE US ONE FROM ALIFORNIA. I'M REALLY LOOKING AT INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN. USE THE TECHNOLOGY. THE TEAMS DID NOT HAVE MACHINE LEARNING EXPERIENCE OR EXPERTISE SO THEY HAD IDEAS OF HOW THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE IT BUT DIDN'T HAVE HANDS ON I'M KIND OF KNOWLEDGE DATE PROPOSED THEIR IDEAS AND I WAS SOMETHING THAT WE THOUGHT WAS. I'M REALLY EXCITING WE'VE SEEN THEM ALREADY IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS MAKE SIGNIFICANT GAINS ON THEIR PROJECTS WE BROUGHT THEM INTO GOOGLE LAST MAY FOR I'M KIND OF A WHOLE WEEK WE CALLED IT A BOOT CAMP I'M TRAINING IN. MACHINE LEARNING PAIRED WITH I'M EXPERTS I'M HANDS ON MENTOR SHIP THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I THINK THEY ARE GREAT EXAMPLES AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A LOT OF OTHERS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ON PEOPLE IN AND COMMUNITIES AND OTHERS. WHO ARE LEARNING A LOT OF THIS ON THEIR OWN THROUGH THREE MATERIALS THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF MENTORSHIP A LITTLE BIT OF HELP A LITTLE BIT OF -- SEED FUNDING SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF EXAMPLES OUT THERE PEOPLE WHO CAN ACTUALLY LEARN THIS THEY DON'T NEED TO BE EXPERTS DON'T NEED A PHD I'M BUT DO YOU NEED TO BE WILLING TO INVEST A LITTLE BIT OF TIME -- AND EFFORT INTO. LEARNING AND KIND OF PRACTICING BUT YEAH I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES HERE THANK YOU. YOUR CHILD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOST INTERESTING TESTIMONY AND I'M SURE THAT OUR PATHS WILL CROSS AGAIN HERE. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NEXT WE HAVE -- DOCTOR JOSH WILL CRAWL ON DOCTOR KROLL IS THE POST -- DOCTORAL RESEARCH SCHOLAR IT. THAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNANCE PUBLIC POLCY AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS DR CROLLES RESEARCH FOCUS ON HOW TECHNOLOGY FITS WITHIN A HUMAN DRIVEN NORMATIVE CONTEXTS. HE IS MOST INTERESTED IN THE GOVERNANCE OF AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING SYSTEMS ESPECIALLY THOSE USING MACHINE LEARNING. DOCTOR CLOSE PREVIOUS WORK SPANS ACCOUNTABLE ALGORITHMS CRYPTOLOGY CRYPTOGRAPHY. SOFTWARE SECURITY FORMAL METHODS BIT COIN IN THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF CYBER SECURITY. DOCTOR CROW HOLDS A MASTERS AND A PHD IN COMPUTER SCIENCE FROM PRINCETON UNIVERSITY WHERE HE RECEIVED THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN DOT CROLLES GOING TO SPEAK TO US ABOUT HIS SOME OF HIS RESEARCH. AND SOME LEGISLATIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THANK YOU DOCTOR CROW FOR BEING HERE CREATION. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AMBERG SENATOR -- OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ARE I GUESS I CAN SKIP OVER MY BIO BECAUSE YOU'VE GIVEN EVEN MORE THANI HAD PLANNED. TO OUR MY WERE QUITE IMPRESSIVE THOUGH SO THANK YOU. YEAH WELL THANK YOU -- MY WORK FOCUSES AS YOU MENTIONED ON THE NEED TO DESIGN COMPUTER SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT HUMAN VALUES SUCH AS FAIRNESS PRIVACY SECURITY AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE WHEN COMPUTERS ARE USED TO MAKE LIFE ALTERING DECISIONS SUCH AS WHO WINS AN ELECTION. WHO GETS ACCESS TO FINANCIAL PRODUCTS ARE AND WHETHER SOMEONE SHOULD BE INCARCERATED OR WHETHER A DIAGNOSTIC IMAGE SHOWS -- EVIDENCE OF DISEASE. AS WE MOVE INTO A WORLD WHERE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEINCREASES THE NUMBER STEAKS AND SPEED OF THESE DECISIONS IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE DESIGN SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT HUMAN VALUES AND TO BE SUBJECT TO ROBUST GOVERNANCE. SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS. COUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. HERE I USE THE TERM ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY THAN THE OTHER WITNESSES TO MEAN ANY BEHAVIOR BY MACHINE THAT A PERSON WOULD CONSIDER TO BE INTELLIGENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THAT. I WANT TO MAKE THREE POINTS TODAY. FIRST WELL THEIR MECHANICAL COMPUTERS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED OBJECTIVE. SECOND THERE EXIST BOTH TECHNICAL AND NONTECHNICAL METHODS FOR CONTROLLING SOFTWARE BASED SYSTEMS AND HOLDING THEM TO HIGH STANDARDS OF FITNESS FOR USE. I INCLUDING APPROPRIATELY ACCOUNTING FOR VALUES SUCH AS FAIRNESS AND SECURITY AND VERIFYING TO REGULATORS OVERSIGHT ENTITIES AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE THAT THESE STANDARDS ARE BEING MET. AND THIRD WELL THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL WAY TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT AND CONSEQUENCES OF A PARTICULAR COMPUTER SYSTEM. GOVERNANCE REGIMES BASED ON ROBUST ACCOUNTABILITY HOLD THE GREATEST PROMISE OF ENABLING THE BENEFITS OF TECHNOLOGY WHILE MINIMIZING HARMS. TO MY FIRST POINT ALTHOUGH COMPUTERS ARE OFTEN DESCRIBED AS MECHANICAL AND THEREFORE OBJECTIVE WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT ALL TECHNICAL SYSTEMS ARE IN TRUTH SO SHOULD TECHNICAL SYSTEMS MEANING THEY INCLUDE PEOPLE ORGANIZATIONS INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS LEGAL AND SOCIAL. THE IMAGINED OBJECTIVITY OF COMPUTERS DERIVES FROM THEIR MECHANICAL NATURE AND THEIR RELIANCE ON DATA ABOUT THE WORLD -- BUT CHOICES ABOUT WHICH DATED TO GATHER WHICH DATED TO USE AND THE NATURE OF THAT USE WORK TOGETHER TO CAPTURE EXISTING SOCIETAL INEQUITIES. DATA RESULT FROM PROCESS OF MEASUREMENT AND CAN SYSTEMATICALLY DEVIATE FROM THE UNDERLYING PHENOMENON OF INTEREST A PROBLEM KNOWN TECHNICALLY AS THE PROBLEM OF BIAS. MEASUREMENT CHOICES ARE JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE DESIGN CHOICES MADE WHEN AND I SYSTEMS ARE CONSTRUCTED OR DEPLOYED INTO THE WORLD. NO DECISION IS PURELY TECHNICAL OR ENTIRELY FREE OF POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND NO COMPUTER SYSTEM. SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO REVEAL OBJECTIVE TRUTH EVEN SYSTEMS THAT ARE BASED ON DATA ABOUT THE WORLD AS MANY I SYSTEMS ARE. INDEED S. SYSTEMS CAN AND DO REFLECT AND REINFORCE EXISTING SOCIAL STRUCTURES AND BIASES DISCRIMINATING AGAINST VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND OFTEN -- INADVERTENTLY TREATING. GROUPS LESS WELL THAN HISTORICALLY ADVANTAGE GROUPS. MACHINES PLAY FORWARD THE POLITICAL CHOICES MADE DURING THEIR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION. WHEN SYSTEMS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL INFORMATION THAT REFLECTS DISCRIMINATION? THE CHOICE TO USE THIS INFORMATION REFLECTS A PARTICULAR PERSPECTIVE ON HOW SUCH SYSTEMS SHOULD WORK. FOR EXAMPLE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT FACE DETECTION SYSTEMS WHICH IDENTIFY WHETHER A PHOTOGRAPH HAS A FACE IN IT WORK LESS WELL FOR DARK SKINNED PEOPLE THAN FOR WHITE PEOPLE AS WELL AS LESS WELL FOR WOMEN THAN FOR MEN. AND THE PERFORMANCE FOR DARK SKINNED WOMEN IS EVEN WORSE TRANSFORMING A MOSTLY FUNCTIONAL BUT OCCASIONALLY AIRING SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR NINE OUT OF TEN PEOPLE INTO A BROKEN ONE THAT WORKS ONLY TWO FOR ONLY TWO OUT OF THREE I OTHER RESEARCH TO WHICH I CONTRIBUTED. DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL FOR FALSE MATCHES IN FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEMS. WHICH ASSOCIATE AN IDENTITY WITH A DETECTIVE FACE. ARE THESE FALSE MATCHES INCLUDED NEARLY TWICE AS MANY FALSE MATCHES FOR DARK SKIN FACES AS FOR LIGHT ONCE. BOTH KINDS OF UNEQUAL FAILURE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A COMBINATION OF THE DESIGN EVALUATION WORK FLOWS OF THE SYSTEM'S NOT CONSIDERING SUFFICIENTLY DIVERSE DATA. AND DECISIONS IN THE EARLY HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY ABOUT HOW TO BUILD A AND DEVELOP CAMERAS AND FILM TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD CAPTURE WHITE FACES ACCURATELY. EVEN IF WE STIPULATE THAT A FACE PROCESSING SYSTEM COULD WORK PERFECTLY. I ITS USE WOULD TEND TO ENABLE SURVEILLANCE AND POLICING. BOTH A PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED HEAVILY IN THE PAST AGAINST MINORITY GROUPS FOR WHICH THE TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY LESS ACCURATE -- SO MAKING IT MORE ACCURATE WOULD CAUSE THOSE GROUPS TO BE POLICE -- TO AND SURVEILLED MORE HEAVILY I AND A BILL LIMITING THE USE OF FACE SURVEILLANCE AND POLICE BODY CAMERAS IS CURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THIS BODY AS A B.. TWELVE FIFTEEN IT IS. IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT RESEARCH BY JOURNALISTS AT PROPUBLICA IT DEMONSTRATED THAT A TOOL USED TO ESTABLISH THE RISK OF COUNTY FLORIDA FALSELY RATED BLACK ARRESTEES AS HIGH RISK FOR FUTURE CRIME AT NEARLY TWICE THE RATE. OF WHITE ARRESTEES EVEN WILL CORRECTLY ESTABLISHING THE RISK OF FUTURE REST FOR BOTH GROUPS. THIS COUNTER INTUITIVE RESULT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT BLACK PEOPLE IN BROWARD COUNTY ARE ARRESTED AS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER RATE THAN WHITE PEOPLE. MATHEMATICALLY GUARANTEEING THAT CALIBRATING RATINGS TO RISK WOULD LEAD TO UNEQUAL AIR DISTRIBUTION IT'S REPUBLICANS STUDY HAS SPAWNED MUCH RESEARCH ON BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION AND I SYSTEMS. RECENTLY PASSED AND NOW RECALLED SB TEN MANDATES THE USE OF SIMILAR RISK ASSESSMENTS TO DETERMINE PRE TRIAL SANCTIONS AS PART OF THE LAUDABLE GOAL OF ELIMINATING MONEY BACK. BUT WITH FEW CONTROLS ON WHETHER THESE TOOLS PROMOTE JUSTICE DUE PROCESS OR THE EQUITABLE ADMINISTRATION OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS LEAD TO IMPORTANT NEW GOVERNANCE QUESTIONS. ON THAT WE DON'T YET HAVE ANSWERS TO ALTHOUGH I DID CONTRIBUTE TO A REPORT BY THE AIR RESEARCH COMMUNITY THAT WAS COORDINATED. I AM RELEASED BY A MULTI STAKEHOLDER GROUP CALLED THE PARTNERSHIP ON A AYE FOR THE BENEFIT OF PEOPLE IN SOCIETY. WHICH LOOKS AT THE GOVERNANCE OF SUCH RISK ASSESSMENT SYSTEMS AND LAYS OUT A BASELINE OF TEN ISSUES. WITH WHICH A RESPONSIBLY GOVERNED RISK ASSESSMENT -- APPROACH MUST GRAPPLE. EVEN DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT COMPUTER SYSTEMS TO BUILD OUR POLITICAL DECISIONS. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT SIMPLY REMINDING PEOPLE OF THEIR COURT DATES FOR EXAMPLE BY TEXT MESSAGE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES APPARENT IMPROVES APPEARANCE RATES WITHOUT COMPARING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES AND STARTING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT A SYSTEMS GOALS ARE. WE RISK CEDING CONTROL OVER IMPORTANT PUBLIC FUNCTIONS TO PLACES BEYOND THE REACH OF GOVERNANCE. DECISIONS ABOUT WHO WILL BE RELEASED DURING THE PRE TRIAL PERIOD AND WHO WILL BE DETAINED STAND TO BE INFLUENCED MORE BY DATA SCIENTISTS AND BY JUDGES. AND THE SCIENTISTS ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE PUBLIC POLICY MAKING PROCESS. THE FACT THAT JUDGES HAVE THE FINAL SAY ON THESE COMPUTER GENERATED RECOMMENDATIONS IS COLD COMFORT IN LIGHT OF RESEARCH ON AUTOMATION BIAS THE DIFFERENCE OF HUMANS TOWARDS MACHINE GENERATED DECISIONS. AND RESEARCH REVEALING THE MANIPULATION OF SCORES BY COURT CLERKS ARE OTHER PROFESSIONALS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHO GATHER AND ENTER THE DATA. FROM WHICH THE SCORES ARE CALCULATED. MY SECOND POINT IS THE TECHNICAL TOOLS AND NONTECHNICAL INTERVENTIONS CAN HELP US CONSTRUCT SOFTWARE THAT IS RELIABLE. BOTH FIT FOR PURPOSE AND SOME. THIS REQUIRES A PARADIGM SHIFT AWAY FROM A MINDSET THAT WE BUILD COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND ONLY THEN ASSESS THEIR IMPACTS ON SOCIAL AND POLITICAL VALUES. I AND THEN CONSIDER MODIFYING THEM BASED ON THAT ASSESSMENT. INSTEAD THE SYSTEMS MUST BE DESIGNED FROM THE START TO REFLECT OUR VALUES IN THEIR REQUIREMENTS REQUIREMENTS ARE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED AT THE BEGINNING OF A SYSTEMS LIFECYCLE DESCRIBING WHAT IT SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT DO. I AND EXPLICITLY INCLUDING THESE. GOALS AND CONSTRAINTS SUCH AS PROTECTING PRIVACY OR ADVANCING FAIRNESS. COMMON INDUSTRY PRACTICES SUCH AS SOFTWARE TESTING CODE REVIEW AN EXPLICIT TRACKING BUGS ALL SERVE TO IMPROVE SECURITY RELIABILITY IN VARIOUS WAYS AND BRING US CLOSER TO THESE GOALS. BUT EVEN WITH SUCH METHODS BUGS IN VULNERABILITIES ARE PERCEIVED AS INEVITABLE. WELL NO SYSTEM CAN BE PERFECT COMPUTER SCIENCE OFFERS A SUITE OF RICHER AND MORE POWERFUL TOOLS INCLUDING CRYPTOGRAPHY SUFFER VERIFICATION. AND MATHEMATICAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE CAPABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES. ALL OF THESE SUPPORT STRONGER CLAIMS ABOUT THE RELIABILITY FITNESS FOR PURPOSE AND PRESERVATION OF VALUES SUCH AS PRIVACY SECURITY IN FAIRNESS IN COMPUTER SYSTEMS. OF MY OWN WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED A HOW TO BUILD ENHANCED AUDIT LOGS FOR AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING SYSTEM SO THAT CONSUMERS TO RECEIVE. SAY CREDIT SCORE CAN BE CERTAIN THAT A COMPLETE JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR SCORE EXISTS MEANING THAT THE FORMULA FOR GENERATING SCORES REPORTED SOMEWHERE ALONG WITH THEIR CREDIT HISTORY. I AND ALONG WITH THE FACT THE FORMULA APPLIED TO THEIR PERSONAL CREDIT HISTORY GENERATES THEIR PARTICULAR SCORE. THESE TOOLS CAN ALSO BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SAME DECISION POLICY FOR EXAMPLE THE SAME CREDIT SCORING FORMULAS APPLIED TO EVERYONE. ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE WHILE PRESERVING THE PROPRIETARY NATURE OF THE DECISION POLICY FOR EXAMPLE THE SECRECY OF THE CREDIT SCORING FORM. A I SYSTEMS NEED NOT BE FAULTY UNRELIABLE BLACK BOXES WHICH LIE BEYOND HUMAN UNDERSTANDING AS THEY ARE OFTEN PORTRAYED. THIS IS A POLITICAL CHOICE. SOFTWARE SYSTEMS CAN INSTEAD BE DESIGNED TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY IN ALL SITUATIONS I OR AT LEAST TO CONTAIN FAILURES TO PARTICULAR SUB SYSTEM SO THAT THEY DO NOT IMPAIR THE OVERALL RELIABILITY OR FITNESS FOR USE. THE IMAGINED INSPIRED ABILITY OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS STEMS FROM DIFFERENCES IN KNOWLEDGE AND POWER DYNAMICS BETWEEN SYSTEM CONTROLLERS. SYSTEM CONSUMERS AND SYSTEM OVERSEERS. ALTHOUGH LARGE OFFER PLATFORMS OFTEN CLAIM THAT THEY CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY A PARTICULAR ADVERTISEMENT WAS SHOWN. WHY A PARTICULAR SEARCH RESULT WAS RANKED AS IT WAS OR WHEN AND HOW OFTEN A PARTICULAR SOCIAL NETWORK POST WILL BE VIEWED? THE SAME COMPANIES ARE OFTEN HIGHLY CERTAIN OF WEATHER CHANGES TO THEIR ALGORITHMS WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE REVENUES. OR CHANGE THE BEHAVIORS OF THEIR USERS IN PARTICULAR WAYS. CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE COMPUTING ECOSYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE THE GOOGLE HOMEPAGE HAVE BECOME SO CONSISTENTLY AVAILABLE THAT OUTAGES ARE NOW BECAUSE FOR NEWS STORIES. AND JUSTICE AIRPLANES ELEVATORS AND BRIDGES HAVE BEEN IMPROVED SO THAT YOU AND I CAN RELY ON THEM WITHOUT A NEED FOR A DEEPER DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OR WHY THEY WORK. SO TO CAN SOFTWARE BE DESIGNED AND BUILT TO MEET STANDARDS OF PROPER FUNCTION IN A CONVINCING WAY. AND JUST AS THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION THE ELEVATOR UNIT OF THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH DIVISION OR THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. PARLAY THOSE TECHNICAL ASSURANCES INTO THE TRUST OF AVERAGE CITIZENS. SO COULD AN APPROPRIATE REGULATORY REGIME FOR SOFTWARE PARLAY THE CERTAINTIES OF SOFTWARE BASED SYSTEMS INTO BROAD SOCIAL TRUST. THIS BRINGS ME TO MY THIRD POINT WHICH IS THAT HUMANS AND ORGANIZATIONS MUST BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BEHAVIOR OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND ESPECIALLY A AYE SYSTEMS. UNFORTUNATELY COMPUTER SYSTEMS TEND TO UNDERMINE EXISTING GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES CHALLENGING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF FAILURES THE ABILITY TO EXAMINE AND ANALYZE DECISION MECHANISMS AND THE SPEED AND SCALE OF DECISION MAKING. MERELY EXPLAINING SOFTWARE I PUTS TO HUMANS IS UNLIKELY TO HELP ON ITS OWN. AND PLACING A HUMAN INTO THE WORK FLOW ARTIFICIALLY LIMITS THE PROMISE OF ECONOMY THESE SYSTEMS OFFER WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY PREVENTING THEIR APPLICATION IN CERTAIN DOMAINS WHERE THEY CAN BE EXTRAORDINARILY VALUABLE. FURTHER STILL WE KNOW THAT HUMAN DECISION MAKING CAN BE FLAWED. I AND YET WE TREATED AS A GOLD STANDARD BUT COMPUTERS ARE MACHINES WE CAN DESIGN THEM SO THAT WE KNOW HOW THEY WILL BEHAVE IN ALL CASES. THAT'S WE CAN HOLD THEM TO HIGHER STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE AND TRANSPARENCY THAN EVEN HUMAN BUREAUCRACIES. ALL TOO OFTEN COMPUTER SYSTEMS FAILED TO REFLECT THE VALUES WE DESIRE THEM TOPPLED. SOFTWARE IS EXCELLENT AT IMPLEMENTING CLEAR CUT RULES AT HIGH SPEED ACROSS LARGE POPULATIONS HOWEVER COMPUTERS EVEN WITH THE ADVENT OF ADVANCED AI. ARE LESS APT TO DEALING WITH SITUATIONS THAT REQUIRE REASONING BEYOND STATED RULES -- OR THAT REQUIRE INTERPRETATION THE APPLICATION OF THOSE RULES FLEXIBLE STANDARDS ABSTRACT PRINCIPLES AND THE NORMAL INTENTIONAL AMBIGUITY IN CONTRACTS AND LEGISLATION ALL LIE BEYOND THE MECHANISTIC OPERATION OF SOFTWARE. WELL COMPUTER SCIENTISTS CAN CAN CAN GUARANTEE THE FIDELITY OF SOFTWARE -- TO ARTICULATED REQUIREMENTS THE REAL WORLD REQUIRESMORE FLEXIBILITY. INSTEAD TO SUPPORT THESE HIGH MINDED GOALS WE MUST HIGH HUMAN INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS COURTS JUDGES OVERSIGHT ENTITIES LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES -- INTO COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGNING SO SHE TECHNICAL SYSTEMS WHICH IMPROVE UPON THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES WE HAVE TODAY. YET WITH THAT IN MIND POLICY MUST NOT MANDATE THE DESIGN OF TECHNOLOGY INSTEAD THE HUMANS AND HUMAN ORGANIZATIONS TO CREATE A ÁI SYSTEMS MUST BE MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFE INAPPROPRIATE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEMS. THAT IS POLICY INTERVENTION SHOULD SPECIFY WHAT THE CONTROLLERS OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RATHER THAN THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SYSTEM SHOULD ACHIEVE THOSE ASSURANCES. PERHAPS SETTING MINIMUM STANDARDS OR GUIDELINES FOR PROCUREMENT ALONG THE WAY. HOLDING THE CREATORS AND CONTROLLERS OF A AYE SYSTEMS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIORS PRESERVES THE FLEXIBILITY FOR INNOVATION WHILE PROVIDING AVENUES FOR GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT. SUCH RESPONSIBILITY WILL REQUIRE THE DEFINITION OF AND OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW BEST PRACTICES IN A AYE DEVELOPMENT THAT TIGHT TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL CONTROLS INTO THE SUPPORT. OF OPERATIVE HUMAN VALUES. TOUGHER SYSTEM DEVELOPERS ARE CURRENTLY UNANSWERABLE FOR THEIR DECISIONS EVEN WHEN THOSE DECISIONS CAUSE HARM. STAKEHOLDERS RARELY HAVE ANY PUBLIC FORUM IN WHICH TO EXPRESS THEIR NEEDS AND CONCERNS. WELL PROTECTIONS FOR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INTERESTS HAVE TENDED TO SHIELD SYSTEM DESIGNERS FROM THE NEED TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. ONE STUDY APPLIED OPEN RECORDS LAWS TO SMART CITY AUTOMATION PROJECTS IN FORTY TWO JURISDICTIONS ACROSS TWENTY THREE STATES REPRESENTING DEPLOYMENTS OF SIX DIFFERENT TYPES OF PREDICTIVE A AYE SYSTEMS. ONLY ONE COUNTY WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE A LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY CONSISTENT WITH DECISION MAKING BY GOVERNMENT AND HUMAN BUREAUCRACIES RATHER THAN BY PRIVATE SECTOR AND A AYE SYSTEMS. WELL GOVERNOR A AYE REQUIRES A MORE ROBUST PUBLIC SPHERE AROUND THE SYSTEM DESIGN -- AND DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS THAT THE SYSTEM'S ENCOUNTER. ALTHOUGH IT IS OFTEN SUGGESTED AS A SOLUTION HOWEVER FULL TRANSPARENCY OF SOFTWARE SYSTEMS IS GENERALLY NEITHER NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE ASSURANCE TECHNIQUES. A MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY AND THE DISCUSSION THAT -- WAS HAD WITH DOCTOR CHAO ABOUT. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND THE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW. OUR NORRIS TRANSPARENCY SUFFICIENT BECAUSE SOFTWARE -- THAT IS NOT DESIGNED TO FACILITATE ASSURANCE MAY IN FACT BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANALYZE FOR TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE. THE TRANSPARENCY IS OFTEN UNDESIRABLE IT PRESENTS RISKS TO INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY IN TRADE SECRECY WELL FACILITATING THE STRATEGIC GAMING OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS. OUGHT TECHNOLOGIES CREATING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE STRUCK THAT ARE SUBTLER AND MORE FLEXIBLE THAN TOTAL TRANSPARENCY -- AND AND WE SHOULD PURSUE THAT THAT ROUTE OF COURSE THIS DISCUSSION ALLIED'S A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT QUESTIONS IN THE POLICY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. THE I. INDUSTRIES HUNGER FOR DATA ABOUT INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS AND CITIZENS LEADS TO NEW THREATS TO PRIVACY. THE USE OF STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES TO IN FIRST SENSITIVE INFORMATION SUCH AS HEALTH STATUS WITHOUT ITS BEING EXPLICITLY DISCLOSE CHALLENGES THE ASSUMPTIONS OF EXISTING DATA PROTECTION LAWS. INCLUDING THE NEWLY ENACTED CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY. FOR EXAMPLE ONE MAJOR RETAILER REPORTEDLY DEVELOPED A SYSTEM FOR PREDICTING WHICH OF ITS CUSTOMERS WERE PREGNANT BASED ON THEIR PURCHASE HISTORIES RAISING THE SPECTER OF NEW FORMS OF HEALTH BASED DISCRIMINATION. FROM ACTORS WITH NO OVER ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE INFORMATION. THERE'S ALSO WIDE AGREEMENT THAT IS A AYE AUTOMATES AN INCREASING NUMBER OF TASKS THE NUMBER AND NATURE OF JOBS REMAINING FOR HUMANS WILL CHANGE DAMASCUS. THIRD WILL CHANGE DRAMATICALLY. AS NEW AND MORE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS WORK DISPLACE EXISTING HUMAN MEDIATED SYSTEMS OF WORK. THE EFFECTS ON WORKERS AND THE POLICY RESPONSES NECESSARY TO MITIGATE THEM REMAIN IMPORTANT OPEN QUESTIONS. IN CONCLUSION AS POLICY IN ENGINEERING PRACTICE INVOLVED TO DEAL WITH THE NEW FOUND IMPORTANCE OF SOFTWARE SYSTEMS IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE DO NOT ALLOW SOFTWARE SYSTEMS TO OPERATE. CHECKED BY DESIGNING A AYE SYSTEMS SO THAT THEY BETTER LINE WITH LEGAL AND POLICY OBJECTIVES WE CAN IMPROVE THE GOVERNANCE OF SOFTWARE SYSTEMS. AND SOMETIMES OF EXISTING HUMAN MEDIATED SYSTEMS BY EXTENSION. THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU [inaudible] QUESTIONS [inaudible] NO. QUESTION BUT I TRY TO UNDERSTAND. UP A LOT OF WHAT YOU WERE SAYING BUT I THINK I GOT THE GIST OF SEVERAL OF OF THE ISSUES. WHICH KIND OF POINT. TO HAVING. KIND OF A OF SOMEONE WITH YOUR EXPERTISE. IN THE FRONT END [inaudible] IN GOVERNMENT. SO THAT AS WE DEVELOP POLICIES THAT WE COULD NEVER IMAGINE WOULD. HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT OR WOULD HELP TO CREATE BIASES -- OR INEQUITIES THAT WE DON'T DO IT. JUST ACCIDENTALLY WE WE SHOULD. BE VERY CONSCIOUS OF THAT SO -- SHAPE. I THINK I THE A LOT OF THAT. THANK YOU -- THANK YOU SENATOR RUSSELL I'M. I HAVE NO QUESTIONS I THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR KROLL FOR COMING UP. THANK YOU I KNOW WITH IT WILL VISIT AGAIN -- I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR TIME EFFORT AND EXPERTISE -- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISH TO EXPRESS POINTS OF VIEW. THE S. -- SENATOR RUSSELL. I ASK YOU TO CHAIR THE COMMITTEE FOR JUST A FEW MOMENTS. YOU CAN PASS AROUND US. MADAM CHAIR SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS HEARING SERRA FLOCKS IN THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION THERE'S SO MUCH TO COMMENT ON HERE BUT I WANTED TO FOCUS. NARROWLY ON THE IMPACT OF WORK CURSE -- THIS CAME UP SEVERAL TIMES AND AND THERE WAS AN ARTICLE RECENTLY THE NEW YORK TIMES ABOUT. HOW A ROBOT WON'T NECESSARILY REPLACE YOUR JOB BUT THEY MAY BE YOUR BOSS? AND THERE'S A LOT OF IMPLICATIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS WHEN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE STARTS TO PERMEATE THE WORK FORCE. I'M ISSUES OF SURVEILLANCE AND ISSUES OF DISCRIMINATION RIGHT NOW A LOT OF WORKERS ARE MONITORED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THERE SOME COMPANIES. REPORTEDLY LIKE AMAZON -- THAT HAS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT. EVALUATES AND FIRES WORKERS THIS RAISES ISSUES OF WEIRD YOU GO IF YOU ARE RETALIATED AGAINST HER FIRED AND THINK IT'S DISCRIMINATORY. DO YOU GO TO D. FBIH. IS THERE A CLAIM OF A MACHINE FIRES YOU FOR DISCRIMINATION ON ANY BASIS -- SO I JUST A HOST OF ISSUES DEALING WITH THE WORKPLACE EVEN BEYOND HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE DISPLACEMENT OF WORKERS. I'M WE THINK THAT MOST LIKELY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY WILL CHANGE THE NATURE OF WORK IN WAYS THAT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF I'M DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF OF HEALTH STATUS THINGS LIKE THAT. AND THEN JUST QUICKLY WANTED TO GO. BACK TO THE SPEAKER FROM GOOGLE WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THESE COMPANIES ARE DEVELOPING ETHICS BUT AS SENATOR UMBERG POINTED OUT. PUBLIC PUBLIC SERVANTS ELECTED OFFICIALS AND ADVOCATES HAVE VERY DIFFERENT OBLIGATIONS BOTH LEGAL AND FIDUCIARY -- PRIVATE COMPANIES HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO THEIRSHAREHOLDERS AND THEIR INVESTORS AND A DIFFERENT MOTIVE AND SO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT POLICYMAKERS. HAVE ALSO SOME ETHICS AND GUIDANCE AND REGULATIONS -- AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCES IS DEPLOYED IN THE PUBLIC AND THE WORK FORCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING A REBEKAH MARK AS REPRESENTING THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LAW. AS YOU MOVE FORWARD IN YOUR WORK TO ADDRESS THE GROWING IMPACT OF A AYE IN CALIFORNIA THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LAW STRONGLY URGES YOU TO CONSIDER FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. THE IMPACT OF A AYE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LICENSE PROFESSIONS SPECIFIALLY HOW DO WE PROTECT CONSUMERS WHEN MACHINES CAN DO THINGS AS OF NOW WITHOUT REGULATIONS THAT HUMANS NEED A LICENSE TO DO. ON THE OTHER HAND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE THE PROFESSIONS THEMSELVES ARE NOT PREVENTING ACCESS TO HIGHER QUALITY AND CHEAPER SERVICES BY DEEMING CERTAIN EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. AS UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE WHERE THEY MAY HAVE PROTECTIONIST MOTIVES AT HEART. OUR CENTER IS CURRENTLY STUDYING THESE ISSUES AND WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ASSIST THE COMMITTEE AS IT CONTINUES THIS IMPORTANT WORK. GOOD MORNING NANCY VARIAS FROM SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND REPRESENTING STATE EMPLOYEES UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING THIS HEARING ALSO SENATOR -- TO SENATOR DRAWS -- FOR MENTIONING THE ONE PIECE THAT I THINK WAS MISSING FROM THE AGENDA WHICH WAS THE WORK FORCE. AND THE IMPACT ON HOW -- ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND HOW IT WILL AFFECT THE WORK FORCE -- TECHNOLOGY FOR TECHNOLOGY'S SAKE DOESN'T WORK IN THIS STATE WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN MULTIPLE TIMES -- AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAVA POINTED OUT ON THE WORK FORCE HAS TO BE TRAINED AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY HAVE TO BE INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. WHEN THAT DOESN'T WORK AN ACTUAL PEOPLE GET BLAMED -- FOR THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ON HOW THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS. LASTLY I JUST WANTED -- TO POINT OUT AS THE COMMITTEE MENTIONED -- THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS REALLY TAKEN THE LEAD ON THIS I THINK WITH THE OFFICE FORCED WORKS FORCE COMMISSION -- AND YOU KNOW WE APPRECIATE ALL THE LEGISLATION THAT'S OUT THERE SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ALREADY BAYARDO SEIU CALIFORNIA JUST REAL QUICKLY I THINK WILL ECHO SOME OF THE THE COMMON THIRTY MADE I THINK THE ISSUE OF PRIVACY -- IS SOMETHING THAT WILL WORK ON SEPARATELY -- BUT I THINK THAT A CORE ISSUE FOR SK YOU IS ALWAYS BEEN INCOME INEQUALITY AND I THINK WHEN YOU. LISTEN TO ALL THE THINGS ARE SAID I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT INNOVATIONS THAT ARE OCCURRING BUT I THINK THAT ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REALLY DRAMATICALLY INCREASED. THAT INCOME INEQUALITY THAT ALREADY EXIST IN OUR SOCIETY SO I THINK THAT THAT HAS TO BE ONE OF THE CORE. OF VALUES THAT WE HAVE AS OF POLICY MAKERS WITH KEEP THAT IN MIND AND MAKE SURE THAT THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE DON'T EXASPERATED PROBLEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M ANY OTHER COMMENTS UP LET ME LET ME AGAIN THANK THOSE WHO TRAVELED SO FAR AND SPEND TIME. INVESTIGATING THIS ISSUE -- AS IS POINTED OUT BY NUMBER WITNESSES THIS IS A HUGE AREA AND NO DOUBT THERE ARE MANY MANY OTHER ASPECTS THAT NEED TO BE EXPLORED THE PURPOSE TODAY'S HEARING WAS SORT OF OPEN THE DOOR AND BEGIN THAT CONVERSATION -- IT IS -- AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER NAMA POINT OUT. IT IS CONCERNING THE THE CALIFORNIA HAS NOT REALLY BEGUN THAT CONVERSATION ORGANIZED FASHION. AND SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ABOUT THIS WILL BE THE FIRST OF OF SEVERAL HEARINGS THAT WILL BE HELD.
