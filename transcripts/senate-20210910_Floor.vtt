00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:40.818
RECENTLY RELEASED THE FIRST

ALTERING THE PLANET'S NATURAL

SYSTEMS AND WORSENING. EXTREME

00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:53.297
WEATHER EVENTS AROUND THE WORLD

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:53.831
THAT WAS WITNESSED HERE IN

00:33:53.898 --> 00:33:55.299
CALIFORNIA. WHEN I WAS

00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:56.567
SECRETARY FOR NATURAL

00:33:56.634 --> 00:33:59.570
RESOURCES- I DID WORK WITH THE

00:33:59.637 --> 00:34:01.239
STATE OF NEVADA ON LAKE TAHOE

00:34:01.305 --> 00:34:03.207
AND THE SCIENTISTS TOLD US.

00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:04.809
THAT LIKE TAHOE WAS HEATING

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:07.345
FASTER THAN ANY FRESH WATER

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:10.548
LAKE ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET.

00:34:10.615 --> 00:34:16.387
WHEN WE- VISIT- OF MY FAMILY

00:34:16.454 --> 00:34:18.423
GLACIER PARK WE WERE BASICALLY

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:20.124
TOLD GLAD YOU GOT HERE THE

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:21.859
GLACIERS WILL NOT BE HERE AND

00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:24.028
ASSUME NUMBER OF YEARS. WHEN WE

00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:25.863
EXPERIENCED A FIRE THAT WENT

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:28.399
FROM CALISTOGA TO SANTA ROSA A

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:30.802
FEW YEARS AGO. IT WENT IN

00:34:30.868 --> 00:34:32.970
SOMETHING LIKE SIX HOURS AND A

00:34:33.037 --> 00:34:37.141
FIRE ON THE SAME FOOT PRINT IN

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:37.742
NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR TO TWO AND

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:40.044
A HALF DAYS. THE FIRE IN

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:43.981
PARADISE- WAS SOMETHING THAT

00:34:44.048 --> 00:34:47.752
YES THERE IS- EIGHTY OR NINETY

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:49.220
YEARS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION BUT

00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:50.822
IT BROUGHT UP AGAINST THE

00:34:50.888 --> 00:34:53.024
CHANGES IN CLIMATE. AND THE

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.792
FACT THAT THAT FAR REMOVED

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:56.060
SIXTY ACRES A MINUTE AND YOU

00:34:56.127 --> 00:34:58.663
COULD NOT OUTRUN IT WAS IN PART

00:34:58.729 --> 00:35:00.631
DUE TO THE CONDITIONS CREATED

00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:02.200
BY CLIMATE AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:04.135
IN A DROUGHT. AND WE'RE IN THE

00:35:04.202 --> 00:35:05.937
SECOND YEAR OF THE DROUGHT AND

00:35:06.003 --> 00:35:07.338
YEP WE HAVE PASSED WHERE WE

00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:09.140
WERE IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF THE

00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:11.709
DROUGHT FROM TWENTY ELEVEN TO

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:13.077
TWENTY FIFTEEN. IN MY OWN

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:15.546
DISTRICT LAST YEAR I WAS IN SAN

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:17.381
LUIS OBISPO WHEN THEY RECORDED

00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:19.350
A TEMPERATURE OF A HUNDRED AND

00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:21.152
TWENTY DEGREES. IT IS

00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:23.554
HAPPENING. AND IT IS HAPPENING

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:27.391
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE

00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:29.327
TO TAKE ACTION. AN ACCOUNT. HAS

00:35:29.393 --> 00:35:32.296
A HISTORY OF SETTING GOALS AND

00:35:32.363 --> 00:35:34.565
USING GOALS AS THE MEANS TO

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:37.001
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES I RECALL

00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:38.736
BEING A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER.

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:40.505
BUT WHEN THIS LEGISLATURE

00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:41.739
PASSED AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED

00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:45.710
A GOAL TO DIVERT 50% FROM MORE.

00:35:45.776 --> 00:35:46.878
OF WASTE DIVERSION FROM

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:48.279
LANDFILLS IN CALIFORNIA AND I

00:35:48.346 --> 00:35:49.881
THOUGHT AT THE TIME GREAT GOAL

00:35:49.947 --> 00:35:52.850
IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN. AND YET-

00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:54.385
THAT BILL GAVE THE TOOLS TO

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:56.087
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WE MET

00:35:56.153 --> 00:35:58.256
THE GOAL AND WE EXCEEDED IT. I

00:35:58.322 --> 00:35:59.790
WAS ONE OF THE EARLY CO AUTHORS

00:35:59.857 --> 00:36:01.826
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX OF A. B.

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:03.995
THIRTY TWO. AND WHAT I B.

00:36:04.061 --> 00:36:04.862
THIRTY TWO DID THIS WITH OUR

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:06.230
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WALKING

00:36:06.297 --> 00:36:08.533
AWAY FROM THE KYOTO ACCORDS. WE

00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:11.302
PUT THE KYOTO ACCORDS INTO LAW

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:13.671
IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE SAID THAT

00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:15.540
BY TWENTY TWENTY WE WOULD GO

00:36:15.606 --> 00:36:17.875
BACK TO THE MISSIONS. THAT

00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:20.311
EXISTED IN THIS STATE IN

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:22.046
NINETEEN NINETY AND TWENTY

00:36:22.113 --> 00:36:24.415
TWENTY WE MET THAT GOAL. THEN

00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:26.450
GOVERNOR BROWN IN TWENTY ELEVEN

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:28.252
SIGN THE BILL. THAT SAID WE

00:36:28.319 --> 00:36:30.454
WOULD GO 233% RENEWABLES AND

00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:33.224
OUR ELECTRICITY PORTFOLIO BY

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:33.858
TWENTY TWENTY PEOPLE SAID

00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:35.560
THAT'LL BE A HARD GOAL. WE HAVE

00:36:35.626 --> 00:36:38.896
MET THAT GOAL. SO BASICALLY

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:41.332
WHAT THIS BILL IS THE NEXT STEP

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:43.568
IN THAT PROCESS. THERE ARE

00:36:43.634 --> 00:36:45.369
THREE MAIN PARTS OF THIS BILL

00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:46.971
THAT CODIFIES CALIFORNIA'S

00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:48.472

TECHNOLOGIES A C. ACHIEVE REAL

00:37:16.033 --> 00:37:18.202
MEASURABLE VERIFIABLE CARBON

00:37:18.269 --> 00:37:20.471
REDUCTIONS. CALIFORNIA'S BEHIND

00:37:20.538 --> 00:37:22.306
THE OTHERS OTHER STATES

00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:52.269
KNOW THAT A LOT OF CONCERNS

00:37:52.336 --> 00:37:54.705
AROUND THE IMPACTS OF THE SPILL

00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:56.874
ON OUR ECONOMY ON OUR JOBS. BUT

00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:58.643
I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS AND

00:37:58.709 --> 00:38:00.311
ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH

00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:01.312
THOSE FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:03.047
SANTA CRUZ WE'RE IN A CLIMATE

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:04.815
EMERGENCY. WE ARE LIVING

00:38:04.882 --> 00:38:06.350
THROUGH A TIME OF INCREDIBLE

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:07.418
AND FRIGHTENING CHANGES TO OUR

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:09.787
CLIMATE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE HAS

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:10.287
BEEN THE HOTTEST YEAR ON

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:12.189
RECORD. WE'VE HAD MORE INTENSE

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:13.758
HURRICANES AND DROUGHTS AND

00:38:13.824 --> 00:38:14.859
EVER BEFORE OUR FORCE HERE IN

00:38:14.925 --> 00:38:16.794
CALIFORNIA ARE DRIER THAN EVER

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:18.729
IN RECORDED HISTORY LEADING TO

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:20.765
MASSIVE WILDFIRES THAT WERE

00:38:20.831 --> 00:38:22.199
BARELY CONTROLLING. I WANT TO

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:22.967
POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT I

00:38:23.034 --> 00:38:24.101
DON'T THINK HAS BEEN MENTIONED

00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:25.603
IN THE MANY FLOOR DEBATES OVER

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:28.706
CLIMATE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:29.607
ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING TO BE

00:38:29.674 --> 00:38:31.809
ONE OF THE COOLEST YEARS THAT

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:32.810
WE EXPERIENCE OVER THE NEXT

00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:35.413
HUNDRED YEARS. OWNER PETER

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:36.280
TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILL ALMOST

00:38:36.347 --> 00:38:38.382
CERTAINLY BE THE COOLEST YEAR

00:38:38.449 --> 00:38:38.983
ON RECORD A HUNDRED YEARS FROM

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.819
NOW. NO MATTER WHAT WE DO TODAY

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:42.553
EVEN IF WE GET CARBON EMISSIONS

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.789
DOWN TO ZERO. OUR CHILDREN AND

00:38:44.855 --> 00:38:46.624
GRANDCHILDREN LOOK BACK AT

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:47.491
TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS A YEAR.

00:38:47.558 --> 00:38:49.694
THAT WAS UNIQUELY COOL ONE WITH

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.495
UNIQUELY BENIGN WEATHER EVENTS.

00:38:51.562 --> 00:38:52.830
THE HURRICANES THE WILD FIRES

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:54.732
THE HEAT WAVES TO DROUGHTS.

00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:56.701
THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING RIGHT

00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:57.334
NOW WILL SEEM LIKE THE GOOD OLD

00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:59.470
DAYS. WE TALK ABOUT THE TIPPING

00:38:59.537 --> 00:39:00.271
POINT AND WHETHER WE MIGHT

00:39:00.337 --> 00:39:01.472
REACH THE TIPPING POINT BUT IF

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.007
WE'RE BEING HONEST WITH

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:03.808
OURSELVES WE ALREADY PAST THE

00:39:03.874 --> 00:39:06.243
TIPPING POINT. AT THE IPCC

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.845
CONCLUDED EARLIER THIS YEAR.

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:09.046
EVEN UNDER THE BEST CASE

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:10.548
SCENARIOS FOR REDUCE OUR

00:39:10.614 --> 00:39:12.650
CLIMATE EMISSIONS RADICALLY.

00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:13.617
WE'RE STILL GOING TO FACE

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:14.752
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:15.786
TEMPERATURES OF THE NEXT

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:18.556
CENTURY. THAT WILL LEAD TO

00:39:18.622 --> 00:39:19.957
CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES. SO

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:20.825
THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHETHER WE

00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:21.992
MIGHT REACH A THEORETICAL

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:23.260
TIPPING POINTS ABOUT HOW FAR

00:39:23.327 --> 00:39:24.295
PAST THE TIPPING POINT WE'RE

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:25.896
GOING TO GO. AND IF WE DON'T

00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:27.431
MAKE CHANGES NOW OR WE ONLY

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:29.300
MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES. WE'RE

00:39:29.366 --> 00:39:30.968
LOOKING AT A LONG RUN INCREASE

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:33.170
OF OVER TEN DEGREES FAHRENHEIT

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:35.172
IN AVERAGE TEMPERATURE. THAT IS

00:39:35.239 --> 00:39:36.674
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE HOTTER

00:39:36.741 --> 00:39:38.709
THAN EVER IN HUMAN EXISTENCE.

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:40.311
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT HOT IN

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:42.947
THREE MILLION YEARS. WE ARE

00:39:43.013 --> 00:39:44.715
TERRAFORMING A PLANET RIGHT NOW

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:45.716
UNLESS WE CHANGE COURSE AND

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:47.485
QUICKLY MUCH OF OUR PLANTS

00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:49.520
GOING UNINHABITABLE. PERHAPS IN

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:51.222
MY LIFETIME CERTAINLY WITHIN A

00:39:51.288 --> 00:39:54.024
COUPLE GENERATIONS. THIS BILL

00:39:54.091 --> 00:39:56.494
IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE. I'VE GOT

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.095
CHILDREN I KNOW MANY OF YOU

00:39:58.162 --> 00:40:00.831
HAVE CHILDREN MY CHILDREN ARE

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:02.366
TEN EIGHT AND FIVE. THEY CANNOT

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:04.735
VOTE. CANNOT LOBBY YOU. CANNOT

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:06.704
DONATE YOUR CAMPAIGNS ARE FUN

00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:08.873
AND I EAT A SUPPORT YOU. MAYBE

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:10.074
MY KIDS WILL HAVE KIDS OF THEIR

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:11.675
OWN AND THOSE KIDS DOWN THE

00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:13.110
LINE THEY ALSO CAN'T VOTER

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:15.146
INFLUENCE PUBLIC POLICY. BUT

00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:17.381
THESE CHILDREN. THEIR CHILDREN

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:19.049
THE CHILDREN OF THE FUTURE. WHO

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:20.384
HAVE NO VOICE IN OUR POLITICAL

00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:21.752
PROCESS WE KNOW WHAT THEY NEED

00:40:21.819 --> 00:40:23.621
AND WANT FROM US TODAY. BECAUSE

00:40:23.687 --> 00:40:25.022
UNLESS WE CHANGE COURSE AND

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:28.459
AGGRESSIVELY SO WE ARE THEM TO

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:29.927
FUTURE OF MISERY AND HELL. OUR

HEAT WAVES THAT REGULARLY REACH

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.632
A HUNDRED FORTY DEGREES. THEY

00:40:34.698 --> 00:40:36.167
WILL FACE MORE AND MORE EXTREME

00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:38.235
HURRICANES WILDFIRES TORNADOES

00:40:38.302 --> 00:40:39.837
AND DROUGHTS. THAT LOOK

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:41.672
ABSOLUTELY BIBLICAL IN

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:42.173
COMPARISON TO WHAT WE'RE

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:43.808
EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. THEY'LL

00:40:43.874 --> 00:40:45.910
FIGHT WARS OVER RESOURCES THAT

WE'RE ALL FACING TODAY. THERE

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:54.585

ACT AGGRESSIVELY WE HAVE TO ERR

00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:39.363
ON THE SIDE WITH. THE

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.699

IMMEDIATELY AND DECISIVELY.

00:42:02.519 --> 00:42:04.021
THOUGH SOME OF MAY BELIEVE OR

00:42:04.088 --> 00:42:05.522
ARGUE THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:07.324
NOW IS NOT AS POTENTIALLY

00:42:07.391 --> 00:42:09.159
DEVASTATING THAT'S WHAT

SCIENTISTS AND EXPERTS SAY I

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:12.229
FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT

REASONABLE BILL GIVEN THE

00:45:39.636 --> 00:45:41.538
ENORMITY OF THE CHALLENGE.

00:45:41.605 --> 00:45:43.307
THERE'S A BILL WITH PROBABLY

00:45:43.373 --> 00:45:47.411
TWO WEEK A TIME LINE. IT'S A

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:49.713
BILL THAT. GIVES A LOT OF

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:54.885
DISCRETION. TO THE AIR BOARD TO

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:56.954

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:57.888
SURE THE CALIFORNIA'S AT THE

00:45:57.955 --> 00:45:59.423
HEAD OF THE LINE IN TERMS OF

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.226
INNOVATION. THERE WILL BE LOTS

00:46:02.292 --> 00:46:03.527
OF OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE SURE

00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:05.395

PLACE UNDER. THE WORK. WILL IT

00:46:09.633 --> 00:46:13.137
WILL BE JUST. THERE'S NO REASON

00:46:13.203 --> 00:46:14.905
WHY CALIFORNIA CAN'T CONTINUE

00:46:14.972 --> 00:46:17.141
TO BE A MAJOR INNOVATOR AND JOB

00:46:17.207 --> 00:46:19.743
CREATOR AS WE COME ALONG AND

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:21.044
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO HELP

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:23.280
SOLVE THIS CRISIS. AND BY THE

00:46:23.347 --> 00:46:24.748
WAY THIS BILL PROVIDES JOB

OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR OIL SECTOR

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:28.085
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:29.186
ACTUALLY BEEN AN ISSUE FOR A

00:46:29.253 --> 00:46:30.821
CONTROVERSY ON THE PROGRESSIVE

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:32.589

HERE THAT ALLOWS FOR. CARBON

00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:38.529
CAPTURE WHICH I KNOW IT'S BEEN

MEANINGFUL TO MANY MANY PEOPLE

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:44.401
AROUND OUR STATE AND OF COURSE

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:45.936
IT'S A TECHNIQUE THAT COULD END

00:46:46.003 --> 00:46:47.571
UP BECOMING A REALLY IMPORTANT

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:50.107

STAKES HERE YOU KNOW SO I THINK

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:26.370
SOMETIMES WHEN IT COMES TO

00:48:26.436 --> 00:48:29.072
CLIMATE CHANGE IT'S SO EASY FOR

00:48:29.139 --> 00:48:30.774
US FOR OUR SOCIETY TO OUR

00:48:30.841 --> 00:48:33.043
PLANET IT HAS TO BECOME LIKE A

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:35.012
DEER CAUGHT IN HEADLIGHTS. YOU

00:48:38.048 --> 00:48:40.951
ABSOLUTE DISASTER COMING OUR

00:48:41.018 --> 00:48:42.919
WAY AND WE'RE SEEING WHAT THAT

00:48:42.986 --> 00:48:44.288
DISASTER HEALTH DISASTER

00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:47.991
MANIFESTS IN OUR DAILY LIVES

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:50.727
WITH THE ORANGE SKIES ND THE

00:48:50.794 --> 00:48:51.728
POSSIBILITY OF A LITERALLY

00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:53.697
RUNNING OUT OF WATER AND THE

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:57.267
SUPER. STORMS AND I CAN GO ON

00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:58.735
AND ON AND ON. WE SEE IT COMING.

00:48:58.802 --> 00:48:59.936
BUT IT'S JUST SO BIG THAT WE

00:49:00.003 --> 00:49:02.406
FREEZE. AND WE EITHER DO

00:49:02.472 --> 00:49:04.041
NOTHING OR WE NIBBLE AROUND THE

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:08.378
EDGES. AND IF WE- GIVE A EXCUSE

00:49:08.445 --> 00:49:10.647
MY LANGUAGE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:13.383
THIS PLANET. THEN IT'S TIME TO

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.786
GO BIG AND GO BOLD WHEN IT

00:49:15.852 --> 00:49:17.988
COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE. NOT

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:20.090
TOMORROW OR A YEAR OR TEN YEARS

00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:23.126
FROM NOW BUT NOW THAT I KNOW

00:49:23.193 --> 00:49:25.762
THE POLITICS ARE HARD. BECAUSE

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:28.298
MEANINGFULLY ADDRESSING CLIMATE

00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:30.834
CHANGE MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO DO

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:33.437
THINGS DIFFERENTLY IN OUR WORLD

00:49:33.503 --> 00:49:35.439
AND OUR DAILY LIVES IN TERMS OF

00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:37.808
OUR ECONOMY. IT MEANS THINGS

00:49:37.874 --> 00:49:39.276
HAVE TO BE DONE DIFFERENTLY AND

00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:41.478
THAT IS HARD THOSE TRANSITIONS

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:42.879
ARE HARD AND I DON'T WANT TO

00:49:42.946 --> 00:49:46.283
MINIMIZE THAT PAIN THAT THOSE

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.318
TRANSITIONS CAN CAUSE. BUT

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:50.687
WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE. JUST TO

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:52.289
ALLOW THE SLOW MOVING TRAIN

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:54.024
WRECK TO CONTINUE TO BECOME A

00:49:54.091 --> 00:49:55.892
VERY FAST MOVING TRAIN WRECK

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:57.661
AND THEN WE DRIVE A CAR TRULY

00:49:57.728 --> 00:50:00.297
INTO THE DITCH. I DON'T WANT A

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:02.632
FUTURE FOR OUR PLANET. THAT IS

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:04.368
DRAMATICALLY WORSE THAN WE'RE

00:50:04.434 --> 00:50:06.536
ALREADY SEEING RIGHT NOW I

00:50:06.603 --> 00:50:07.804
DON'T WANT TO I DON'T THINK

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:09.740
ANYONE WANTS TO AND IT'S TIME

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:12.175
TO TAKE BOLD ACTION. I DO WANT

00:50:12.242 --> 00:50:14.911
TO SERVICE ADDRESS- IN TERMS OF

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:17.147
JOBS IN THE ECONOMY AND I HAVE

00:50:17.214 --> 00:50:19.282
ENORMOUS RESPECT. FOR THE

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:21.418
PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING IN THE

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:23.420
FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY UNDER

00:50:23.487 --> 00:50:25.722
DOING THAT HARD WORK- AND I'VE

00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:27.157
WORKED VERY HARD TO GET THOSE

00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:29.726
GOOD PAYING JOBS- AND I HAVE

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:32.362
ENORMOUS RESPECT. FOR THOSE

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:35.298
INDIVIDUALS. BUT WE ALSO NEED

00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:36.767
TO LOOK AT THE HARM TO OUR

00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:38.535
ECONOMY AND JOBS THAT

00:50:38.602 --> 00:50:40.637
UNCONTROLLED CLIMATE CHANGE. IS

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:41.872
DOING TO THE ATTIC IN THE

00:50:41.938 --> 00:50:43.540
STREET. WHICH IS BEING

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:46.476
DECIMATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:48.412
TWO ARE HEADED TO HOUSING. THE

00:50:48.478 --> 00:50:50.213
PEOPLE WHO BUILD HOUSING WHEN

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.348
MORE AND MORE PARTS OF THE

00:50:51.415 --> 00:50:54.084
STATE ARE GONNA BE UNTENABLE TO

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:56.453
EVEN BUILD ANY HOUSING. BECAUSE

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.889
OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE RISKS

00:50:58.955 --> 00:50:59.823
OF WILDFIRES AND SEA LEVEL

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:03.427
RISE. TO OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

00:51:03.493 --> 00:51:05.862
WHICH IS GOING TO BE OVERRUN.

00:51:05.929 --> 00:51:06.663
BY THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:07.697
CLIMATE CHANGE OUR

00:51:07.764 --> 00:51:09.666
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. WHICH IS

00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:11.134
ALREADY BEING DAMAGE AND WILL

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:13.036
BE A HUGE RISK AND OF COURSE

00:51:13.103 --> 00:51:16.506
ANY INDUSTRY. THAT RELIES ON

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:17.140
WATER. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:51:17.207 --> 00:51:20.076
THEM. WE ALSO KNOW THE CLIMATE

00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:22.012
CHANGE DISPROPORTIONATELY HARMS

00:51:22.078 --> 00:51:23.346
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES

00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:24.981
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHETHER

00:51:25.048 --> 00:51:27.717
PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN IN LOW

00:51:27.784 --> 00:51:29.786
LYING AREAS AND ARE SUBJECT TO

00:51:29.853 --> 00:51:32.289
SEA LEVEL RISE PEOPLE ON

00:51:32.355 --> 00:51:32.856
COMMUNITIES THAT RUN OUT OF

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:35.892
WATER. IT CETERA TO COLLEAGUES

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:37.427
AND DID THIS IN A WAY

00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:39.262
UNDERSTANDS POLITICALLY THIS IS

00:51:39.329 --> 00:51:42.098
A HARD BILL- BUT IN TERMS OF

00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:43.934
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IT'S NOT AND

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.135
I ASKED FOR AN IPO. SENATOR

00:51:45.202 --> 00:51:58.381
BAKER. MEMBERS THREE FIVE

00:51:58.448 --> 00:51:59.549
SAYING AROUND HERE THIS IS A

00:51:59.616 --> 00:52:03.153
SIMPLE BILL. AND WHY DO I SAY

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.021
THAT BECAUSE THE SIMPLY ASK THE

00:52:05.088 --> 00:52:07.757
QUESTION ARE WE SERIOUS ABOUT

00:52:07.824 --> 00:52:10.694
GETTING TO CARBON NEUTRALITY.

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.496
BECAUSE IF WE ARE THEN WE CAN

00:52:12.562 --> 00:52:13.730
QUIBBLE ABOUT THE TIME LINE

00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:15.832
WASHINGTON STATE HAS SAID 95%

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:18.401
REDUCTION BY TWENTY FIFTY. NEW

00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:21.171
YORK STATE 85% BY TWENTY

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:23.673
FIFTEEN MASSACHUSETTS 85% BY

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.609
TWENTY FIFTY THIS BILL IS 90%

00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:26.743
DIRECT EMISSIONS BY TWENTY

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.712
FORTY FIVE. BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:30.480
AN OFFRAMP FROM AIR RESOURCES

00:52:30.547 --> 00:52:32.782
BOARD. AND I'D BE HAPPY THAT

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:34.384
WAS MOVED UP IN THAT IT ALLOWS

00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:35.752
AN OFFERING FOR THE IRISES

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:37.387
EVEREST RESOURCE SUPPORT SAY IS

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:38.989
THAT THE RIGHT NUMBERS AT 90%

00:52:39.055 --> 00:52:41.625
IS IT 85% IT ALLOWS THAT THE

00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:43.260
OFF RAMP. BUT ALSO GIVES

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:44.494
DIRECTION TO THE AIR RESOURCES

00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:46.263
BOARD DESCRIBING PLANS A TWENTY

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:47.397
TWENTY TWO SCOPING PLAN TO

00:52:47.464 --> 00:52:49.165
THOSE EIGHT AWAIT NO IT'S OUR

00:52:49.232 --> 00:52:52.402
JOB TO DIRECT KERR. DID YOU

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:54.271
WHAT WE WANT. SO FOR SERIOUS

00:52:54.337 --> 00:52:56.640
ABOUT IT THE CARBON NEUTRALITY.

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:58.742
THEN LET'S GET THE TIMELINE IN.

00:52:58.808 --> 00:53:01.177
IN AT THIS POINT WE'RE FALLING

00:53:01.244 --> 00:53:02.979
BEHIND OTHER STATES. NOT

00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:04.915
LEADING ADVERTISERS ABOUT THAT

00:53:04.981 --> 00:53:06.016
WE HAVE TO GET READY FOR LOTS

00:53:06.082 --> 00:53:08.018
MORE FIRES AND DEVASTATION

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:08.585
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:10.687
HAPPEN. A LOT OF ELOQUENT

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:11.888
SPEECHES ON CLIMATE CHANGE I

00:53:11.955 --> 00:53:14.224
TRY TO DRESS TO A PIECES OF

00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:15.892
THIS ONE THE CHIEF ABILITY AND

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:18.562
SECOND ON JOBS. NEVER ONE CAN

00:53:18.628 --> 00:53:21.097
WE GET THERE. ABSOLUTELY WE SEE

00:53:21.164 --> 00:53:22.566
THE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCED SO

00:53:22.632 --> 00:53:25.969
RAPIDLY IN SOLAR AND WIND AND

00:53:26.036 --> 00:53:28.405
GEOTHERMAL. I JUST TALKING TO

00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:29.139
ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES REMEMBER

00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:30.473
WHEN EXXON WAS THAT AT THE

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.776
HIGHEST MARKET CAP OF ANY. ANY

00:53:32.842 --> 00:53:35.045
COMPANY IN THIS COUNTRY. NOW

00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:36.079
TESLA AT THE START OF MY

00:53:36.146 --> 00:53:38.081
DISTRICT HAS THREE AND A HALF

00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:41.918
TIMES. THE MARKET CAP. OF EXXON

00:53:41.985 --> 00:53:45.155
MOBIL. SO IT HAS COME DOWN 90%

00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:46.890
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS 99% OF

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:48.158
THE LAST TWENTY OR SO YEARS

00:53:48.224 --> 00:53:49.926
WIND ENERGY THE COSTS KEEP

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:52.662
FALLING SO WE CAN ACHIEVE THIS

00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:53.163
BUT WE MUST DO THIS IN A

00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:54.898
THOUGHTFUL WAY. THINGS EVERYONE

00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:56.733
ALONG AND WE CAN'T. LET'S USE

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.001
THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR

00:53:58.068 --> 00:53:59.336
GREENHOUSE GAS OPTIONS FROM A

CAN DO THAT. AND WE MUST DO

00:54:06.142 --> 00:54:09.779
THAT. ON JOBS THIS BILL DOES

00:54:09.846 --> 00:54:11.214
PRESERVE SOME JOBS AS MIKE MY

00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:13.216
COLLEAGUE THAT MENTIONED. BUT

00:54:13.283 --> 00:54:14.884
WE DO NEED GOOD JOBS AS MIGHT

00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:30.333

00:54:44.814 --> 00:54:46.449
THAT THE BUILDING TRADES IN

00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:02.432
HAPPENED WITHOUT LABOR SP ONE

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:03.500
HUNDRED WOULD NOT HAPPEN

00:55:03.566 --> 00:55:04.634
WITHOUT LABOR BECAUSE YOU KNOW

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:06.469
WE'RE CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS

00:55:06.536 --> 00:55:08.304
IN THOSE AREAS IN GEOTHERMAL IN

00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:13.410
OFFSHORE WIND IN LONG DURATION.

00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:14.010
STORAGE I WILL CONTINUE TO DO

00:55:14.077 --> 00:55:15.912
SO MY CAR PROCESS WORK WITH

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.213
ABOUT- OR MAKING FUN OF THIS

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.516
PERCENT OF 2% AND SO I'M SURE

00:55:19.582 --> 00:55:21.351
THE FACT THAT ONE POINT 6% OF

00:55:21.418 --> 00:55:22.085
OUR WORKERS IN THE STATE

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:23.887
WORKING OIL AND GAS. IT MAY NOT

00:55:23.953 --> 00:55:25.989
BE IMPORTANT TO THEM BUT IT'S

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:28.224
IMPORTANT TO ME AND WE HAVE TO.

00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:33.196
THINK. ABOUT THAT TRANSITION

00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:33.797
AND A NEW REPORT. ADDRESSED BY

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:34.364

SOUTH OF CALIFORNIA OIL

00:55:34.964 --> 00:55:36.599
WORKERS. ESTIMATES ARE STATE

00:55:36.666 --> 00:55:37.967
COULD CREATE FOUR HUNDRED

00:55:38.034 --> 00:55:40.937
EIGHTY. FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:41.571
THOUSAND CLEAN ENERGY JOBS PER

00:55:41.638 --> 00:55:45.275
YEAR. THROUGH A PROGRAM TO CUT

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:45.875
CLIMATE POLLUTION IN HALF OVER

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:47.110
THE NEXT DECADE. IT SAYS IT

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:49.679
COULD CREATE EVEN MORE JOBS SIX

00:55:49.746 --> 00:55:50.313
HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND PER

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:52.082
YEAR. TWO INVESTMENT IN RELATED

00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:52.716
AREAS SUCH AS WATER

INFRASTRUCTURE LEAKY GAS

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.819
PIPELINES PUBLIC PARKS AND

00:55:55.885 --> 00:55:58.455
ROADWAYS. TO SOME BUT NOT ALL

00:55:58.521 --> 00:55:58.988
OF WHICH WOULD ALSO REDUCE

00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:00.890
EMISSIONS. BUT LEADER OF ONE OF

00:56:00.957 --> 00:56:02.459
THOSE UNITS WAS ASKED WHAT WAS

00:56:02.525 --> 00:56:04.360
GOING ON HE SAID QUOTE. AN

00:56:04.427 --> 00:56:05.729
ENERGY TRANSITION IS COMING

00:56:05.795 --> 00:56:07.363
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT. AND

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:09.132
IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE BUILD A

00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:09.733
SECURE FUTURE FOR WORKERS AD

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:12.035

AND YOU CAN SEE THE TRAIN

00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:18.408
COMING. WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT WHY

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:20.143
THE TRAIN IS COMING. WE CAN

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.010
TALK ABOUT EXACTLY WHEN IT'S

00:56:21.077 --> 00:56:23.146
GOING TO GET HERE. BUT IT'S

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:25.482
COMING HE SAID. THE CHOICE FOR

00:56:25.548 --> 00:56:27.283
US IS DO WE STILL HAVE A TRUCK

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:29.152
AND FACE WHATEVER HAPPENS. WHEN

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:30.754
WE GET ON THE PLATFORM AND TRY

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.789
TO CATCH THE TRAIN. GOING OUT

00:56:32.856 --> 00:56:35.525
OF THAT STATION. MY FRIENDS

NORMALLY- I'VE MADE IT A

00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:10.026
PRACTICE NEVER TO US STAND UP

00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:11.795
AND SPEAK AGAINST A DEMOCRATIC

00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:15.398
BILL. NEVER AND I'VE NEVER

00:57:15.465 --> 00:57:17.700

00:57:24.207 --> 00:57:25.441
THERE'S A FALSE NARRATIVE GOING

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:27.277
ON IN THIS BUILDING RIGHT NOW

00:57:27.343 --> 00:57:28.511
THAT IF YOU DON'T VOTE FOR THIS

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:30.613

AND THEY'RE IMPORTANT. BUT THE

00:57:42.725 --> 00:57:45.061
IDEA. IF WE DON'T PASS THIS DAY

00:57:45.128 --> 00:57:48.598
TODAY. THAT OUR CHILDREN AND-GRANDCHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE

00:57:48.665 --> 00:57:51.968

DEVELOPED. THROUGH THE SCOPING

00:58:15.959 --> 00:58:21.364
PLAN WITH DATA AND SCIENCE. IT

00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:24.067
EXPERIENCE WILL ALWAYS LEAD TO

00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:25.501
BETTER DECISIONS AND I THINK

00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:26.836
THIS THING IS BEING RUSHED

00:58:26.903 --> 00:58:28.238

TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES LESS

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:02.865
THAN HALF THE SIZE OF THE

FIVE BILLION IN DAMAGES. IT

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:15.979
DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH WE PUT

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:19.949
IN THE IMPACT IS STILL GREAT TO

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:22.618
ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. CLIMATE

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:24.921
IMPACTS CONTINUE TO CAUSE

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:27.390
DEVASTATING HUMAN LOSS CAPITAL

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.292

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:31.361
DISPLACEMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:32.929
OUR DISTRICT MY DISTRICT HAS

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:36.899
LIVED THAT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:38.368
WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:39.669
THE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:41.771
HOTTER THERE IS MORE DROUGHT MY

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:43.506
DISTRICT HAS NEVER GOTTEN OUT

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:45.208
OF THE DROUGHT THE PART OF THE

01:00:45.274 --> 01:00:46.676
DISTRICT OF THE CALIFORNIA BUT

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:47.643
I LIVE IN IS EITHER THE

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:48.978
BEGINNING OF A CONNECTION OR

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:50.279
THE END OF A CONNECTION TO A

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:52.048
WHOLE LOT OF SYSTEMS. AND SO

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:54.817
WE'VE ALWAYS STRUGGLED. WITH

01:00:54.884 --> 01:00:56.486
THE WATER CONNECTIONS THERE AND

01:00:56.552 --> 01:00:58.721
WE'VE LIVED THE DROUGHT- IN

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:01.024
MANY WAYS AND NOW WE'RE MORE

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.825
THAN TWO DECADES INTO A MAKE A

01:01:02.892 --> 01:01:05.495
DROUGHT ON PAR WITH THE DRIEST

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:07.997
TIMES OF THE LAST MILLENNIUM.

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:10.166
ALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE ISSUES

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:13.136
THAT REPRESENT. GREAT CONCERN

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:15.571
TO THE DISTRICT BUT THEY ALSO

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:18.007
HAVE AN IMPACT ON EVERYONE IN

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:19.575
THE DISTRICT WHETHER IT'S MY

01:01:19.642 --> 01:01:21.144
ELEVEN MONTH OLD CHILD OR

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:23.246
WHETHER IT'S A UNION WORKER IN

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:25.815
THE DISTRICT WHEN WE HAD SOME

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:27.917
OF THESE IMPACTS IN OUR STATE

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:30.553
IN OUR DISTRICT WE HAD TO CLOSE

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.555
HIGHWAY ONE OH ONE FOR THIRTEEN

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:37.126
DAYS. EVERY ENTITY IN EVERY

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:38.861
INDUSTRY I REPRESENTED WAS

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:41.364
IMPACTED. SO THE AD I'M THE

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:42.865
EIGHTH AND THIRTY I REPRESENT

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:43.833
THE EIGHTH AND THIRTEENTH

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.501
LARGEST AG PRODUCING COUNTIES

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:47.270
IN THE STATE. ABSOLUTELY

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:49.872
IMPACTED THERE WAS NOT A WAY TO

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:51.741
GET BACK AND FORTH. ON THAT

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:54.844
ONE- ONE. WE ALSO BENEFIT FROM

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:56.946
TOURISM. ALL OF OUR TOURISM

01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:58.414
INDUSTRY WAS COMPLETELY

01:01:58.481 --> 01:02:01.918
IMPACTED. AND SO I SHARE THIS

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.386
WITH YOU BECAUSE I ALSO THINK

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:04.353
THAT AMONG THE NARRATIVES THAT

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.555
ARE OUT THERE IS THAT THOSE

01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:06.989
THAT ARE MOVING THIS FORWARD

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:09.025
DON'T CARE ABOUT WORKERS. I

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:11.861
CARE ABOUT WORKERS I HAVE A

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:14.964
HISTORY OF SHOWING THAT PEOPLE

01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:15.498
CAN LOOK AT MY LEGISLATIVE

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:19.368
RECORD. AND THIS IMPACTS

ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW IN IN THE

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:29.479
LATE IN THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:30.980
WORKING ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:32.048
AND CLIMATE ISSUES HERE IN THE

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:34.016

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:43.192
REPRESENT. AND I WANT FOLKS TO

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.428
KNOW THAT MY SUPPORT FOR THIS

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:47.330
BILL IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IN

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:49.866
ADDITION. TO THE FINDING THAT

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:50.933
WE'VE ALLOCATED TO TRY TO

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.336
MITIGATE THE IMPACT WE NEED TO

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:55.271
MOVE LEGISLATION AND POLICY

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:59.075
FORWARD. THAT HELPS US. ALSO

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:01.077
TRIED TO SLOW DOWN SOME OF

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:02.478
THESE IMPACTS BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:04.480
SEEING THAT WE CAN'T JUST PUT

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:06.282
MONEY INTO IT AND THAT ALONE

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:08.084
WILL SOLVE. THE PROBLEMS THAT

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:09.785
WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. I'VE

01:03:09.852 --> 01:03:10.820
HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:11.988
COLLEAGUES FROM THE OPPOSITE

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:15.057

YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE SHARED

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:18.161
GOALS I BELIEVE THAT EVERYBODY

01:03:18.227 --> 01:03:21.164
WANTS. TO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:23.065
WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO TO WORK FOR

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:24.967
PEOPLE HAVING WATER WHERE

01:03:25.034 --> 01:03:26.769
PEOPLE CAN BENEFIT FROM THE

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:28.304
INDUSTRIES THAT ARE THERE BUT

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:30.039
WE ALSO HAVE TO. TAKE A LOOK

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:31.774

KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:44.954
ALREADY MADE THE DECISION THAT

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:46.455
YOU WILL NOT RETURN CANNOT

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:48.891
SUPPORT THIS BILL. BUT LIKE I

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:51.160
SAID EARLIER THIS YEAR WHEN A

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:54.197
BILL DID NOT MOVE FORWARD THAT

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:54.964
TO MY COLLEAGUE AND I AM. AND A

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:56.499
FEW OTHERS WORKED ON- MICHAEL

TO SIT AT THE TABLE AND HAVE

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:05.675
THESE HARD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:08.611

I KNOW THESE ARE DIFFICULT

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:13.349
CONVERSATIONS AND I HOPE TO BE

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:14.951
PART OF THEM BUT I ALSO HOPE

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:16.953
THAT WE ALL COMMIT TO TRYING TO

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:19.956
FIND A WAY. NOT JUST TO MOVE

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:23.125
FORWARD IDEAS BUT TO REALLY TRY

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:24.961
TO SLOW DOWN AND THE IMPACTS

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:26.862
THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US IS

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:28.564

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. WHEN

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:40.009
THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:42.245
CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING PROGRAMS

01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:45.014
DECADES AGO. THEY LEFT OUT

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:46.249
ANYTHING RELATED TO WAGE

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:48.918
POLICIES. IT WAS LEFT TO

01:04:48.985 --> 01:04:50.353
ORDINARY PEOPLE TO TRY TO

01:04:50.419 --> 01:04:53.589
ORGANIZE. THE QUOTE UNQUOTE

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:55.992
GREEN JOBS THAT IMMIGRANT

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:58.761
WORKERS DID. THEY SORTED

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:01.697
THROUGH RECYCLED MATERIALS USE

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:03.532
CONDOMS AND HYPODERMIC NEEDLES

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:05.968
WITHOUT SAFETY GLOVES AND FOR

01:05:06.035 --> 01:05:07.603
WAGES THAT ARE SOCIETAL

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:12.174
DISGRACE. I WAS THERE. THAT

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:13.643
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN NECESSARY IF

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:15.611
THE LEGISLATURE HAD TIED

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:17.280
ECONOMIC JUSTICE TO

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:19.715
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS. IT

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:21.917
WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THAT THIS

01:05:21.984 --> 01:05:23.286
LEGISLATURE GAVE THE AIR

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:25.721
RESOURCES BOARD THE POWER. TO

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:26.889
PRIORITIZE CAP AND TRADE

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:29.025
REVENUES FOR QUOTING CODE

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:30.426
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IT

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:33.029
HASN'T HAPPENED. AND WHILE

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:34.797
UPPER MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIANS

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:36.565
GOT FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:39.769
CONSUME LESS GASOLINE LOWER

01:05:39.835 --> 01:05:41.003
INCOME PEOPLE ARE GETTING WHAT

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:42.738
THEIR BOARD CALLS PRICING

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:45.308
POLISH POLICIES THAT PUNISH

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:47.476
THEM FOR WHAT. WE'RE USING WHAT

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.845
THEY NEED. MY PROBLEM WITH THIS

01:05:49.912 --> 01:05:53.049
BILL ISN'T WHAT IT SAYS. BUT

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:56.352
WHAT IT DOESN'T SAY. NOT A WORD

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:59.155
ABOUT JOBS OR WAGES NOT A WORD

01:05:59.221 --> 01:06:01.390
ABOUT ECONOMIC JUSTICE NOT A

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:03.025
WORD ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:05.695

RESOURCE BOARD'S COME UP WITH.

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:09.532
WHEN I RAISE THESE CONCERNS I

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:11.233
AM TOLD THAT THOSE THINGS COULD

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.636
BE ADDRESSED LATER. WELL I

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.771

FIGHTING FOR GARMENT WORKERS. I

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.316
CAME TO THE SENATE TO HELP WIN

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:29.852
THAT FIGHT NOT WAIT. OVER A

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:31.487
DECADE AGO BOMBER KERR BECAME

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:35.057
LAW. I CAME TO THE SENATE. AS

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:37.026

01:06:37.093 --> 01:06:39.428
CARE FOR OLDER IMMIGRANTS IN

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:43.499
CALIFORNIA. NOT TO WAIT. GOING

CARE FOR HOTEL WORKERS. I

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:51.273
LEARNED THE HARD WAY THAT THERE

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:54.243
IS NO EASY WAY. THIS BILL IS

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:57.279
UNFINISHED. UNLESS WE SEIZE

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:59.749
EVERY OPPORTUNITY THE WORKING

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:01.784
POOR WILL ALWAYS BE THE LAST IN

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:04.487
LINE. WE CAN INCLUDE WAGE

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:07.690
POLICIES FIGHTING CLIMATE

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:10.226
CHANGE DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:13.362
REGRESSIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:15.064
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE DOESN'T

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:17.833
NEED TO COME AT THE EXPENSE OF

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:22.238
ECONOMIC JUSTICE. THANK YOU

LUXURY. ANYMORE UNFORTUNATELY

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:58.207
TO SIT BACK AND CONTINUE TO NOT

01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:01.844
PASS LEGISLATION THAT WILL

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.712
ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. AND I'M

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:05.481
ALSO THE DAUGHTER OF A TEAMSTER

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:08.083

PARENTS SO I UNDERSTAND THAT. I

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:16.425
BELIEVE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:18.994
AND WORK FORCE CAN CO EXIST

01:08:19.061 --> 01:08:21.063
THEY CAN. AND I'M COMMITTED TO

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:22.665
THAT I THINK MANY OF US HERE ON

THIS FLOOR ARE COMMITTED TO

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:27.369
THAT. BUT WE CANNOT IGNORE THE

01:08:27.436 --> 01:08:29.171
IMPACTS I HAVE A FIRST GRADER.

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:30.573
WHAT IS HIS LIFE GOING TO LOOK

01:08:30.639 --> 01:08:32.441
LIKE. TWO DECADES FROM NOW.

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:34.477
WHEN THE PLANET IS WARMING.

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:35.578
MORE THAN ONE POINT FIVE

01:08:35.644 --> 01:08:37.780
DEGREES CELSIUS. WHEN THE U. N.

01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:38.981
IS CALLING OUT AND SAYING CODE

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:40.716
RED AND WE'RE SITTING BACK

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:43.352
DOING NOTHING. THE CLIMATE

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:45.621
ACTION ABSOLUTELY CANNOT COME

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:46.689
AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR MOST

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:48.123
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ONE

01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:49.291
IN WHICH I REPRESENT BLACK AND

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:50.993
BROWN COMMUNITIES WERE ALREADY

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.095
DEALING WITH THESE IMPACTS. IN

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:55.164
FACT YOU LOOK UP ANY HEADLINE

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:56.732
ON THE NEW YORK TIMES AND-

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:58.567
THESE ARE THE HEADLINES. MORE

01:08:58.634 --> 01:08:59.902
THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:01.871
MILLION PEOPLE UNDER HE ALERTS

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:04.373
AS MUCH OF. THE U. S. IS

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.175
SCORCHED AGAIN THIS WEEK.

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:07.743
TROPICAL STORM FRED FORMS JUST

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.411
SOUTH OF PORTO RICO I WOULD

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:10.446
WANT TO DIE RIGHT HERE IN AID

01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:12.147
OF AMERICAN COMMUNITY FIGHTS TO

01:09:12.214 --> 01:09:13.048
PROTECT ITS LAND FROM THE DIXIE

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:14.850
FIRE. IN THE VALLEY WHERE ONE

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:16.986
TOWN BURNED FIRE CREWS AND

01:09:17.052 --> 01:09:17.586
VOLUNTEERS ARE STILL BATTLING

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:20.022
THE FLAMES. CANADIAN WILDFIRES

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:21.423
COULD INTENSIFY FROM A LOOMING

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:25.160
HEATWAVE. SO I WANT TO THANK MY

01:09:25.227 --> 01:09:27.062
COLLEAGUES ALL OF THEM WHO

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:28.731
ADDRESSED CONCERNS AGAIN ON ON

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:30.833
MULTIPLE SIDES OF THIS ISSUE I

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:31.934
THINK THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:33.002
DO AND I BELIEVE THAT IF THIS

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:34.803
POLICY PASSES WE WILL CONTINUE

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:36.872
TO BE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:38.941
ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:41.143
WE DO BUILD A CALIFORNIA THAT

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:43.045
TRULY IS REPRESENTATIVE OF

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:44.280
CLIMATE CHANGE WILL BE BOLD ON

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:45.247
THESE ISSUES WITHOUT I

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:47.283
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOAT.

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:49.552
THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ SAID

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:52.755
HER TADO. THANK YOU MADAM

01:09:52.821 --> 01:09:55.724
PRESIDENT- I RISE. TODAY

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:58.093
BECAUSE I WANT TO REDUCE CARBON

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.429
EMISSIONS JUST AS MUCH AS THE

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:02.598
AUTHOR OF THIS LEGISLATION. I

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:04.633
WANT TO HELP FIGHT STOP CLIMATE

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.669
CHANGE AS WELL. THIS BILL

01:10:06.735 --> 01:10:08.671
HOWEVER IS THE WRONG APPROACH

01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:11.140
AND I IT'S MY OPINION THAT IT'S

01:10:11.206 --> 01:10:13.776
UNREALISTIC. TO FIGHT CLIMATE

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:16.078
CHANGE WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:18.747
HUMAN SECURITY ADAPTATION AND-

01:10:18.814 --> 01:10:20.783
MORE PARTLY INNOVATION AS WELL.

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:21.684
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:24.153
REDUCTIONS FOR QUITE SOME TIME

01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:26.855
IN THE STATE. BUT WHAT HAS IT

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:29.458
DONE FOR DISTRICTS LIKE MINE.

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:31.627
IT'S CREATED MORE POVERTY. AND

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:38.167
MORE SUFFERING. AND MORE DEATHS.

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:40.436
REDUCTION IS NOT HELPING MY

01:10:40.502 --> 01:10:42.338
DISTRICT IT'S MAKING LIFE WORSE

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:44.940
FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THERE. WE

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:46.041
HAVE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON

01:10:46.108 --> 01:10:47.910
PRODUCTION THAT WE ARE FAILING

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:50.212
TO ADAPT AND TO INNOVATE. WE

01:10:50.279 --> 01:10:52.414
NEED TO EMPOWER ONE ANOTHER

01:10:52.481 --> 01:10:54.750
AND- WE ALSO NEED TO EMPOWER

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:56.986
INDUSTRY TO BE INNOVATORS AND

01:10:57.052 --> 01:10:58.287
LEADERS OF INNOVATION THAT WILL

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:02.958
HELP US. STOP CLIMATE CHANGE

01:11:03.025 --> 01:11:04.660
OUR FUTURE TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:08.364
CHANGE. OUR FAILURE TO ADAPT TO

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:08.864
CLIMATE CHANGE IS WHAT'S

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.833
KILLING PEOPLE. OUR APPROACH IS

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:13.802
NOT WORKING. I DON'T BELIEVE

01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:15.437
THIS BILL WILL SAVE LIVES IT

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:17.206
WILL NOT STOP CLIMATE CHANGE

01:11:17.272 --> 01:11:20.442
OUR APPROACH MUST CHANGE TO

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:23.579
SAVE THIS PLANET. BUT MORE

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:25.547
IMPORTANTLY TO SAVE MANKIND.

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:26.782
AND FOR THESE REASONS I ASK FOR

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:29.218
A NO VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR HER

01:11:29.284 --> 01:11:34.223
TITLE CENTER BOARD JUST.

01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:34.723
COLLEAGUES I'M A LITTLE

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:39.561
CONFUSED THE- LAST NUMBER OF

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:42.131
LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS AS LONG AS

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:43.932
I'VE BEEN A SENATOR WE HAVE

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:46.135
TALKED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IN

01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:48.871
ALL THAT WE'RE DOING LEADING

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:51.874
THE CHARGE AS CALIFORNIANS. THE

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.642
BUDGET INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:57.179
MAKING IN. OUR GREEN TECHNOLOGY

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:59.782
AND MODIFYING OUR FOSSIL FUEL

01:11:59.848 --> 01:12:03.018
INDUSTRY ENGINE FIVE NEW AREAS

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:05.721
OF ENTERPRISE. WE TAUGHT

01:12:05.788 --> 01:12:07.456
OURSELVES FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING.

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:10.025
BUT TODAY I HEAR THAT WE'RE AT

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:10.926
THE PRECIPICE HAVING DONE

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:14.430
NOTHING. SO WHAT WHAT IS IT.

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:16.031
HAVE WE BEEN LACKADAISICAL HEAD

01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:17.800
AND OUT TO LUNCH ON THIS ISSUE

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:19.134
FOR AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN A

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:21.136
MEMBER OF THIS BODY I DON'T

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:24.440
THINK SO BECAUSE EVERY BILL

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:26.642
SENSE OF IMMEDIACY. THAT UNLESS

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:30.746
WE PASS IT WE ARE. DERELICT IN

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:32.614
OUR DUTIES IN THE STEWARDS OF

01:12:32.681 --> 01:12:36.151
NOT ONLY OUR STATE BUT ON A

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:38.987
BILL WITH OUR PLANET. TWO DAYS

01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:41.290
AGO I THINK WE HAD A BILL. TO

01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:42.791
CREATE A UC PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:45.828
CHINA. FOR A THINK TANK

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:48.263
RESEARCH FACILITY A SO THAT WE

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:50.365
CAN TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:52.568
TO ADAPT TO THE NEW REALITY IN

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.636
WHAT WE WANT TO LOOK LIKE. AND

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:56.839
WE ALL SUPPORTED THAT BECAUSE I

01:12:56.905 --> 01:12:57.840
THINK IT DOESN'T HURT TO

01:12:57.906 --> 01:12:59.041
ACCUMULATE INFORMATION AND

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:01.110
KNOWLEDGE DESPITE MY MISGIVINGS

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:03.979
ON THE BILL ITSELF. BUT I

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:07.316
REMAIN CONFUSED BY HARKING BACK

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:07.816
TO THE COMMENTS FROM THE

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:09.952
SENATOR FROM NAPA. THANK YOU

01:13:10.018 --> 01:13:12.354
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW OUR

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:14.923
CLIMATE IS CHANGING. BUT MY

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:17.659
BOOK BY VOTING AGAINST THIS ALL

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:20.028
OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE A CLIMATE

01:13:20.095 --> 01:13:23.565
CHANGE DENIER. THAT'S NOT

01:13:23.632 --> 01:13:25.901
THAT'S NOT BEING PRACTICAL.

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:27.603
WHEN YOU PUSH SOMETHING AS

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:29.872
AMBITIOUS AS THIS PIECE OF

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:32.074
LEGISLATION IT'S ALMOST BECOME

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:34.877
SYMBOLIC WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:37.246
PUSHING FOR BECAUSE WHAT I'D

01:13:37.312 --> 01:13:39.448
LOVE TO SEE. OR THE METRICS

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:41.984
THAT GO ALONG WITH THE NUMBERS

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:45.587
OF THE NEW EMPLOYMENT SCHEME IN

01:13:45.654 --> 01:13:47.656
THE GREEN NEW DEAL. BECAUSE WE

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:50.292
ALWAYS TAUGHT ALL THE NEW JOBS

01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:52.227
THAT WOULD GO ALONG WITH. A NEW

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:54.730
PIECE OF LEGISLATION RARELY DO

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:56.598
I HEAR THAT NUMBER QUANTIFIED

01:13:56.665 --> 01:14:00.736
pWILL BE LOST BY PREMATURELY IN

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:02.671
SYMBOLICALLY TRANSFERRING INTO

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:04.907
A NEW FORM OF ENTERPRISE OR

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:06.909
TECHNOLOGY. IF WE'RE BEING

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:10.546
HONEST WE HAVE TO DO THAT. I

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:13.482
THINK INDUSTRY WHETHER IT'S IN

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:15.684
THE OIL FIELD OR IN AGRICULTURE

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:18.487
OR IN CEMENT. AS WE DISCUSSED

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:21.356
YESTERDAY. CALIFORNIA IS THE

01:14:21.423 --> 01:14:23.458
GOLD STANDARD SO FOR TO HEAR

01:14:23.525 --> 01:14:26.261
FOLKS SAY THAT WE'RE BEHIND THE

01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:26.962
EIGHT BALL AND HAVE DONE

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:29.398
NOTHING. YET TELL OURSELVES AS

01:14:29.464 --> 01:14:31.800
THE GOLD STANDARD NOT ONLY IN

01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:33.735
IN IN CALIFORNIA AS

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:37.439
CALIFORNIANS BUT WITHIN. THE U.

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:40.776
S. IN OVERSEAS WHICH ONE IS IT

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:42.244
ARE WE STEWARDS AGAIN ARE WE

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.379
BEING AMBITIOUS OR ARE WE BEING

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:47.182
LACKADAISICAL I THINK. A BILL

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:50.953
LIKE THIS. NEEDS TO BE VETTED

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:53.155
IN A MORE SERIOUS WAY. IN

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:54.923
PUTTING OUT AN AMBITIOUS GOALS

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.391
SO THAT WE CAN TELL IT IT ON

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:58.393
SOME SORT OF CAMPAIGN FLYER BUT

01:14:58.460 --> 01:14:59.928
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO BY

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:01.663
YOUR TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THAT'S

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:03.832
THE SAME RATIONALE OF THE PARIS

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:05.868
ACCORDS. BUT I ACTUALLY BELIEVE

01:15:05.934 --> 01:15:07.703
IN MANY OF THOSE CONSTRUCTS OF

01:15:07.769 --> 01:15:10.205
THE PARIS ACCORDS. BUT WE DO DO

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:11.506
YOU TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION IN

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:13.475
SO MANY WAYS BUT WE ALSO HAVE

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:14.042
TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS

01:15:14.109 --> 01:15:17.212
SUSTAINABLE AND BEING HONEST

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:19.748
WITH THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT.

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:20.482
WE HAVE A HISTORY AS

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:22.618
LEGISLATORS OF PRO CLAIMING

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:26.688
THESE BOLD AMBITIOUS GOALS. AND

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:28.090
NEXT THING YOU KNOW WECAN'T

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:30.893
ACHIEVE THEM WE CREATE ANOTHER

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:32.694
SET OF GOALS TO MASK WHAT WE

01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:34.830
WERE UNABLE TO DO IN THE

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:37.165
PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS SO I THINK

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:38.901
IF WE'RE BEING HONEST. PUT

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:44.206
FORWARD. IN REAL TERMS. A PLAN

01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:45.707
WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT

01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:47.709
ACCOMMODATES IT TAKES INTO

01:15:47.776 --> 01:15:50.746
CONSIDERATION JOB LOSS VERSUS

01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:53.715
JOB CREATION ENVIRONMENTAL

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:56.051
CHANGES THAT WE WILL BE A PART

01:15:56.118 --> 01:15:59.254
OF NOT JUST THE 1% OF THE

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:01.924
CLIMATE- PARTICIPATION THAT WE

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:03.725
HAVE AS CALIFORNIANS BUT WHAT

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:04.726
DOES IT MEAN IN THE GREATER

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:06.194
SCHEME OF THINGS WITHIN THE U.

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:09.431
S. IN THE MAJOR PLAYERS IN THE

01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:10.065
EMERGING MARKETS LIKE CHINA AND

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:12.567
INDIA. YOU CAN'T PLAY CHESS ONE

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:15.570
PIECE. YOU GOT TO SEE HOW IT

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:17.139
ALL FITS TOGETHER AND FRANKLY

01:16:17.205 --> 01:16:18.907
THESE OVER AMBITIOUS OVERLY

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:22.611
SYMBOLIC GESTURES SOUNDS GOOD

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:26.682
BUT I THINK THEY LACK SUBSTANCE.

01:16:26.748 --> 01:16:27.215
THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS

01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:33.889
CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU THANK

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:37.859
YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I.

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:38.427
BEEN LISTENING TO A LOT OF

01:16:38.493 --> 01:16:42.130
DEBATE IS QUITE FASCINATING- TO

01:16:42.197 --> 01:16:48.704
LISTEN. TO HISTORY ABOUT WHERE

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.973
CALIFORNIA'S BEEN IN WEATHER

01:16:51.039 --> 01:16:52.207
WE'VE BEEN LEADING INTO WHAT WE

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:54.176
SHOULD DO IS GO FORWARD BUT I

01:16:54.242 --> 01:16:54.843
HEARD A LOT OF STORIES ABOUT

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:58.080
MEMBERS AND- THEIR FAMILIES AND

01:16:58.146 --> 01:17:00.449
WHY THEY CAME HERE IN. I THINK

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:01.917
MAYBE I SHOULD TELL MY STORY A

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:03.885
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY I CAME TO

01:17:03.952 --> 01:17:07.055
THIS LEGISLATURE. I CAME AS A

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:11.526
REPUBLICAN. WHO LIVES IN A VERY

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:15.731
SMALL TOWN. LESS THAN THREE

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:19.901
HUNDRED PEOPLE. ALSO COME FROM

01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:21.269
A FAMILY OF HOME THAT

01:17:21.336 --> 01:17:23.505
HOMESTEADED HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:24.106
AND HAS WORKED THE SAME PIECE

01:17:24.172 --> 01:17:28.276
OF LAND. FOR EIGHTY YEARS I'M

01:17:28.343 --> 01:17:31.313
THE THIRD GENERATION MY SONS

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:31.947
AND MY DAUGHTER WILL BE ARE THE

01:17:32.014 --> 01:17:35.851
FOURTH GENERATION. I CAME TO.

01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:37.719
LOOK FOR TRUE ENVIRONMENTALISTS

01:17:37.786 --> 01:17:42.824
WHEN I SAY THAT. I'M NOT.

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:43.658
SAYING YOU'RE NOT IN

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:44.760
ENVIRONMENTS BUT SOMEBODY WHO

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:46.828
WILL SAY WE NEED TO CUT A TREE

01:17:46.895 --> 01:17:47.462
BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:50.665
DO. NOT BECAUSE- AN

01:17:50.732 --> 01:17:53.535
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP. TELLS YOU

01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:54.436
THAT IT'S THE WRONG THING TO DO

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:57.739
SO I. HAVE HAD FORESTRY TOURS

01:17:57.806 --> 01:17:59.574
I'VE INVITED MANY OF YOU TO THE

01:17:59.641 --> 01:18:02.077
DISTRICT TO EDUCATE BECAUSE I

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:04.846
BELIEVE EDUCATION. OF WHAT IS

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:06.948
REAL AND NOT WHAT IS NOT

01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:07.449
POLITICAL WILL MAKE THE

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:11.953
DIFFERENCE. AND YES I MOVED

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.855
LOTS OF FORESTRY BILLS THROUGH

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:15.891
THIS LEGISLATURE AND BEEN

01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:21.129
SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL. BUT I

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:23.598
VOTED AGAINST TARGETS WHICH

01:18:23.665 --> 01:18:25.467
THIS BILL IS A TARGET THERE'S

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:28.070
REALLY NOT A LOT OF SUBSTANCE

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:28.603
AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:31.840
THERE. AND FOR ME I DON'T HAVE

01:18:31.907 --> 01:18:33.708
THE TRUST THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:18:33.775 --> 01:18:36.578
IS GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:39.314
NOW I PUSH BACK ON.

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:42.784
TECHNOLOGIES BUT I DON'T

01:18:42.851 --> 01:18:43.385
BELIEVE WE'LL GET US WHERE WE

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:46.021
WANT TO GO. I WILL SHARE WITH

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:49.825
YOU TO DATE AFTER A. B. THIRTY

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:53.128
TWO WE HAVE SPENT EIGHT BILLION.

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:55.130
DOLLARS CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS.

01:18:55.197 --> 01:18:59.434
ON A TRAIN. AND HAVE NOT LAID

01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:05.373
ONE FOOT OF TRACK. ONE PUT.

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.441
THAT'S WHY I DON'T TRUST THIS

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:08.643
PROCESS NOW IN THAT PROCESS

01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:10.712
LABOUR LINED UP RIGHT NOW LABOR

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:12.747
IS NOT ON BOARD BUT IF LABOR

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:13.348
WAS ON BOARD. THIS BILL WOULD

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:15.383
BE OUT OF HERE. WE ALL KNOW THE

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:16.985
TRUTH BECAUSE OF POLITICAL IT'S

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:18.487
ABOUT JOBS DOESN'T MATTER WHAT

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:20.422
THEY DO FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:24.326
IT'S ABOUT JOBS. SORRY I'M

01:19:24.392 --> 01:19:31.199
GETTING LOUD. AS I WATCH.

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:34.336
COMPANIES LEAVE CALIFORNIA

01:19:34.402 --> 01:19:34.903
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:37.873
WORK HERE. AND THEY GO TO

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:40.008
STATES WHERE THEY'RE NOT

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:41.977
REGULATED AS HEAVY OR THEY GO

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:45.147
TO OTHER COUNTRIES. AND THAT'S

01:19:45.213 --> 01:19:45.747
YOUR JOBS THAT ARE LEAVING THE

01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:48.850
STATE. THE EXODUS OF JOBS OUT

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:50.986
OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF OUR

01:19:51.052 --> 01:19:52.921
REGULATIONS AND THE REGULATIONS

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:56.458
ARE CHANGING THE ENVIRONMENT.

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:57.859
AS I TALKED ABOUT THE BILL TO

01:19:57.926 --> 01:20:00.962
REGULATE. LAWN MOWERS AND WEED

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:02.998
EATERS AS MY FOREST IS BURNING

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:05.267
DOWN THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.768
GOING TO GIVE THE CALIFORNIA

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:09.304
AIR RESOURCES BOARD MORE POWER

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:13.074
WITH THIS BILL. THEY GOT WAY

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:13.875
TOO MUCH AS IT IS WE NEED TO

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:14.943
HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT ON WHAT

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:16.511
THEY'RE REALLY ACHIEVING. WE

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:21.183
HAD A. ANALYSIS OF WHAT THEIR

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:23.185
CARBON WAS PER DOLLAR AND IT

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:27.656
WAS HORRIBLE. SO WHAT DID WE DO.

01:20:27.722 --> 01:20:29.691
THEY JUST CHANGE ADMINISTRATORS

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:31.059
AND SAID WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:32.594
WITH THE NEXT ADMINISTRATOR.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.062
THE SAME THING WE'VE DONE ON

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:35.897
THE BULLET TRAIN EVERY TIME IT

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:36.498
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S PERFORMANCE

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:38.633
WE CHANGE THE DIRECTOR AND THE

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:39.768
NEXT GUY'S GOING TO FIX THE

01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:41.570
PROBLEM AND THEY DON'T FIX THE

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:42.103
PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:45.840
POLICY. WHAT I'M GONN ASK YOU

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:47.776
A QUESTION WHAT WAS THE WETTEST

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:50.212
YEAR ON RECORD IN THIS. STATE

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:50.812
OF CALIFORNIA I BET YOU DON'T

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:54.683
KNOW. IN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:58.853
TWO YEARS OF KEEPING RECORDS.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:20:59.454
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. DECEMBER

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:00.889
AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:02.924
EVERYWHERE THE WETTEST YEARS ON

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:05.994
RECORD IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:09.764
IN A DROUGHT RIGHT NOW. OUR

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:12.934
RESERVOIRS WERE A HUNDRED AND

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:15.937
5% OF PEOPLE. EIGHTEEN MONTHS

01:21:16.004 --> 01:21:20.242
AGO. WHERE DID THE WATER GO.

01:21:20.308 --> 01:21:21.810
THIS ADMINISTRATION RELEASED

01:21:21.876 --> 01:21:24.913
THE WATER. BECAUSE THERE'S

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.915
ENOUGH WATER IN OUR RESERVOIRS

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:28.450
TO TAKE CALIFORNIA FOR FIVE

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:32.887
YEARS. SO THERE'S A LOT OF

01:21:32.954 --> 01:21:35.123
POLICY THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:35.757
IN THIS PLACE AND THERE'S A LOT

01:21:35.824 --> 01:21:37.325
OF PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE. HELD

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:41.062
ACCOUNTABLE. RELEASING WATERS.

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:42.998
AND NOT TAKING CARE OF THE

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:43.632
ENVIRONMENT AND NOT LAYING THE

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:45.533
TRACK. AND THIS BILL IS GOING

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:49.037
TO DO NOTHING MORE ADD TO THAT.

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:52.474
MEMBERS FOR THE FUTURE OF MY

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.709
FAMILY AND MY RANCH I ASK YOU

01:21:54.776 --> 01:21:55.610
TO VOTE NO ON THIS AND MANY

01:21:55.677 --> 01:21:56.611
OTHER BILLS UNLESS DO SOME

01:21:56.678 --> 01:21:59.047
POLICY AROUND HERE IT'S

01:21:59.114 --> 01:21:59.547
ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE A

01:21:59.614 --> 01:22:00.815
DIFFERENCE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:02.250
IT ACTUALLY KEEPS BUSINESSES IN

01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:04.119
CALIFORNIA. AND NOT SHIFTING

01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:06.788
OUR JOBS TO. CHINA WHERE THEY

01:22:06.855 --> 01:22:08.857
POLLUTE IT'S THE SAME ERROR.

01:22:08.923 --> 01:22:10.525
ALL COMPANIES COMPETE AGAINST

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:11.993
ALL THESE OTHER COMPANIES I

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:13.128
COMPETE AGAINST COMPANIES IN

MY WAGES ARE SO MUCH MORE AT

01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:27.709
SOME POINT I CAN'T COMPETE. AND

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:28.243
I THINK I'M A PRETTY GOOD

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:31.379
FORMER. BUT AT SOME POINT IN

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:33.281
THE LEGISLATURE'S CAUSING MY

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:35.784

OUR PRODUCT FROM FOREIGN

01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:55.196
CALIFORNIANS EXPECT. I LISTEN

01:23:55.263 --> 01:23:55.997
TO A LOT OF COLLEAGUES TALK

01:23:56.064 --> 01:23:56.898
ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN AND

01:23:56.965 --> 01:23:58.199
GRANDCHILDREN YOU KNOW MY

I THINK ONE OF LUPUS WHICH YOU

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:15.683
HAVE THE ELECTRICITY COME ON.

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:17.852
WHEN THEY GET OLDER. THEY WANT

01:24:17.919 --> 01:24:19.687
TO BE ABLE TO COOK ON A STOVE

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:21.022
INSIDE THE HOUSE AND NOT HAVE

01:24:21.089 --> 01:24:22.757
TO BUILD A FIRE. I THINK THE

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:24.225
WAY THAT. THIS BODY IS

01:24:24.292 --> 01:24:25.693
APPROACHING CLIMATE CHANGE IS

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.562
REALLY DETRIMENTAL. IT'S

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:29.431
THROUGH OVER REGULATION. I CAN

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:31.866
TELL YOU THAT- WITH EVERYTHING

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:33.735
THAT'S GOING ON IN ALL THE- THE

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:35.103
BANNING OF LAWN MOWERS AND JUST

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:48.516
EVERYTHING PLUS THIS. SOLUTION

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:49.684
TO MAKE THAT WORK. AND FIX

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.453
THAT. SO THAT THAT'S ONE THING

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:52.787
THAT WE CAN CHECK OFF OUR LIST

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:54.122
AND I THINK THAT WE COULD GET A

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:55.390
LOT OF I AM FROM. FROM

01:24:55.457 --> 01:24:57.192
EVERYBODY. AT ALL PARTIES

01:24:57.258 --> 01:25:01.563
INVOLVED. I CAN TELL YOU THAT-

01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:02.597
I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT

01:25:02.664 --> 01:25:03.665
EVERYTHING THAT EVERYBODY SAID

01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:04.666
BUT I'M JUST GETTING IN THIS

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:05.733
WITH A VERY SIMPLE THING

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:06.434
BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE TALKED

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:08.570
ABOUT THIS. YOU CAN SET THE

01:25:08.636 --> 01:25:09.304
GOAL YOU CAN MAKE THEIR

01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:11.206
SPEECHES YOU CAN USE THIS FOR

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:12.507
SPEECHES AND CAMPAIGNS IN YOUR

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:14.108
DISTRICT. BUT I CAN TELL YOU

01:25:14.175 --> 01:25:15.710
THAT IT'S UNATTAINABLE. AND I

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:17.378
CAN TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE I

01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:18.880
HAVE A LINE MIKE THOUGHTS WITH

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:20.181
THE GOVERNOR OF THIS STATE TOO

01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:22.116
IS. REALLY AN ENVIRONMENTALIST.

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:25.019
BUT LAST. MONTH HE HAD TO

01:25:25.086 --> 01:25:28.056
AUTHORIZE EMERGENCY USE FOR

01:25:28.122 --> 01:25:29.557
FIVE NEW GAS LINE GENERATORS TO

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:30.959
BE BROUGHT ON LINE TO MEET THE

01:25:31.025 --> 01:25:33.328
NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS. SO WHEN

01:25:33.394 --> 01:25:34.128
THEY FLIP THE SWITCH THE LIGHT

01:25:34.195 --> 01:25:36.464
CAME ON. SO NOBODY TALKS ABOUT

01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:38.500
THAT IT'S NOT IN THE MEDIA. D.

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:40.835
W. R. ACTUALLY THE- THE

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:41.703

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:45.139
THEY'RE GOING TO INSTALL FIVE

01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:47.375
NEW GAS POWERED GENERATORS. DUE

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:49.110
TO ENERGY SUPPLY CONCERNS

01:25:49.177 --> 01:25:51.346
BECAUSE THEY ARE CALIFORNIANS

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:53.648
THAT WE REPRESENT EXPECT. TO BE

01:25:53.715 --> 01:25:54.449
ABLE TO TURN ON THE AIR

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:55.950
CONDITIONER WHEN IT'S A HUNDRED

01:25:56.017 --> 01:25:56.985
TEN DEGREES. AND THEY WANT

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:57.886
THEIR AIR CONDITIONER TO COME

01:25:57.952 --> 01:25:59.420
ON THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:25:59.487 --> 01:26:00.788
THEY HAVE LIGHTS IF THEY NEED

01:26:00.855 --> 01:26:01.689
BREATHING TREATMENTS AT NIGHT

01:26:01.756 --> 01:26:04.158
THEY WANT THE POWER TO WORK. SO

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:04.859
THAT THEY CAN USE THOSE

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:07.195
BREEDING TREATMENTS. SO I THINK

01:26:07.262 --> 01:26:09.264
MOVING IN A DIRECTION OF.

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:11.432

01:26:31.252 --> 01:26:32.720
PEOPLE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER WE

01:26:32.787 --> 01:26:34.155

HAVE THAT WE ALL AGREE THAT WE

01:26:35.456 --> 01:26:37.525

NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH LAW

05:00:06.088 --> 05:00:08.090
ENFORCEMENT OVER THE PAST TWO

05:00:08.156 --> 05:00:09.991
YEARS BUT THIS BILL IS BACK IN

05:00:10.058 --> 05:00:11.960
FRONT OF US- AFTER JUST BEING

CANDID WITH HIS BODY THAT WAS

05:00:13.729 --> 05:00:15.997
VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR WE TOOK

THAT IT'S GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL

05:00:27.943 --> 05:00:29.711
BUT HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

05:00:29.778 --> 05:00:32.414
WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT ALLOWS

05:00:32.481 --> 05:00:35.283

CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE LEADING

05:01:02.444 --> 05:01:03.612

PROTECTED IN THIS NATION IN THE

05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:16.892
STATE ARE THE JOURNALISTS THEY

05:01:25.133 --> 05:01:26.501
LET'S JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE

05:01:26.568 --> 05:01:28.270

05:01:43.018 --> 05:01:44.052
SOME RED HERRINGS OUT THERE

05:01:44.119 --> 05:01:45.153

05:01:47.989 --> 05:01:49.458
THAT THEY'RE A REPORTER. THIS

05:01:49.524 --> 05:01:51.593
BILL DOESN'T CHANGE A LAW

05:01:51.660 --> 05:01:52.828
ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO BE

05:01:52.894 --> 05:01:54.629

05:02:09.611 --> 05:02:10.879
JOURNALISTS ARE THE ONES THAT

05:02:10.946 --> 05:02:11.580

ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL HAT THIS.

05:02:24.793 --> 05:02:25.360
LEGISLATURE PASSES BILL. THANK

05:02:25.427 --> 05:02:25.994

READING THE LETTERS OF

05:02:26.561 --> 05:02:27.662
OPPOSITION FROM THE LAW

05:02:27.729 --> 05:02:28.663
ENFORCEMENT INDIVIDUALS THAT

05:02:28.730 --> 05:02:29.564
WERE ON THE GROUND AND THAT'S

05:02:29.631 --> 05:02:31.500
WHAT POSE THOSE QUESTIONS. AND

05:02:31.566 --> 05:02:32.534
THEY ALSO SAY THAT CURRENT

05:02:32.601 --> 05:02:34.069
LOTTERY ALREADY GIVES DULY

05:02:34.135 --> 05:02:35.670
AUTHORIZED ME PERSONAL ACCESS

05:02:35.737 --> 05:02:37.772
TO THESE EVENTS. SB NINETY

05:02:37.839 --> 05:02:39.174
EIGHT ADDS A VAGUE NEW STATUTE

05:02:39.241 --> 05:02:40.475
THAT CREATES A NEW VIOLATION

05:02:40.542 --> 05:02:42.244
THAT OVER IT'S OVERLY BROAD.

05:02:42.310 --> 05:02:43.812
ACCORDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:02:43.879 --> 05:02:46.281
AND IT CUT IS. BOUND FOR COSTLY

05:02:46.348 --> 05:02:48.450
LITIGATION. AND SO I'D

05:02:48.517 --> 05:02:50.051

AND THAT. YOU KNOW SO I THINK

05:03:10.505 --> 05:03:12.607
THAT THIS BODY TENDS TO PROTECT

SOME SPEECH THAT THEY LIKE BUT

05:03:14.476 --> 05:03:15.610
NOT SPEECH THAT THEY DON'T

05:03:15.677 --> 05:03:17.212
LIKE. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR

05:03:17.279 --> 05:03:18.280
CASE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

05:03:18.346 --> 05:03:19.848
COMPLETELY AGAINST THIS BILL

05:03:19.915 --> 05:03:20.949

THAT WERE TAKEN ON THIS SIDE OF

05:04:06.194 --> 05:04:08.697
THE AISLE BEFORE IT- MOVED OVER

05:04:08.763 --> 05:04:11.232

THE ASSEMBLY SIDE- AND WHERE

05:04:33.254 --> 05:04:35.924
THIS STILL STANDS- JUST BECAUSE

05:04:35.991 --> 05:04:38.193
THERE WAS SUCH CONCERN. ABOUT

05:04:38.259 --> 05:04:40.362
THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE- AND

05:04:40.428 --> 05:04:42.163

05:31:31.805 --> 05:31:33.640
WOULD REPORT THOSE CASES AND IT

05:31:33.707 --> 05:31:35.709

FEDERAL LAW SO IN MANY WAYS THE
