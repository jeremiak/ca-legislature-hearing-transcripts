THE THE FAMOUS STORY THAT. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF OUR DIRECTOR AT THAT TIME BT COLLINS DRUNKARD CLASS OF MOLLIFY AND I PROBABLY LIKE A BUNCH OF OTHER FOLKS WERE THERE BUT. PUB ALLOT OF FOLKS OF EVERYWHERE. OUT TO PROVE THAT THE MALATHION WAS HARMLESS AND. KIDS DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME YET TRANSFORM A RUMOR IS THE GOOD GALA SICK AFTER THAT BUT SINCE THEN. WE'VE COULD. SINCE THEN WE'VE CONTINUED TO. UMP. PROVIDE SUPPORT. AND MORE RECENTLY IT'S BEEN THE RATIFICATION MEANS ACTUAL STRIPPING OF FRUITS SO OF. AGRICULTURAL OF IDENTIFIED NEIGHBORHOODS OUR COMMUNITY IS OUR RESIDENTS WHERE. THERE ARE FRUIT. AND CORPS MEMBERS ARE WILL GO IN TEAMS. AND IDENTIFY THE HOUSE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR. TELLING THEY'RE GONNA. THE FRUIT BAG UP AND THEN DESTROY. THEY DIDN'T. A FEW WEEKS TWO THOUSAND HOURS OF WORK. THE LATEST LAST DECEMBER.

IN COUNCIL DISTRICTS SEVEN AND SIX I BELIEVE. GREAT THANK YOU FOR FOR THE REPORT JOB DID YOU WANNA ADD A COMMENT HERE. HOW WE? AYE WE GOING IS THIS ISSUE NUMBER ONE AND TWO ARE WE GOING TO GO OVER THOSE NAPSTER WAS THAT.

AND SO IN THAT YOU'VE GOT GIVEN UP YOUR OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOUR BLOOM. OTHER GOT RIGHT ALONG. SO WITH REGARD TO THE GROUP'S NUMBER COUNSELING CASE MANAGEMENT TRANSITION TO COLLEGE AND CAREER TRAINING AND WHERE ARE RECOMMENDING FUNDING THE TRANSITION SERVICES. AS A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM. THAT WE THINK THAT THAT FUNDING THE SERVICES COULD HAVE BENEFITS BUT THE LACK OF DATA ON POLICY SEE OUTCOMES MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO FULLY X. SAT ASSESSED CORPSE IN A NEED FOR THE SERVICES. NEVER RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE FUND THESE ANA THAT THREE YEAR. PERIOD AND REQUIRE THE CCC TO COME BACK IN THREE YEARS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED THIS PROGRAM. THAT WERE ALSO RECOMMENDS LEGISLATURE ADOPT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ACQUIRE THE CCC TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH AN ANNUAL REPORT ON THAT CORPSE IN GRAPTEMYS. BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. AND THIS UC SYNDICATES IN ITS BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT IT INTENDS TO PUBLISH AN ANNUAL REPORT. WE THINK WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO SPECIFY THE INFORMATION THAT IT WOULD LIKE THE CCC TO REPORT ON. AND THEN WITH REGARDS TO THAT PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE CONSULTING SERVICES THAT PART OF THE PROPOSED WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU APPROVE THAT WE THINK THERE'S A NEED FOR THAT. AND THEN WITH REGARD TOTHE OTHER PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE RESIDENTIAL CENTERS. I WILL RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE WAIT UNTIL THERE'S MORE INFORMATION ON QUIPS MEMBER OUTCOMES BEFORE APPROVING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE RESIDENTIAL CENTERS. AND WE GOT THE CONSTRUCTING THE NEW CENTERS MIGHT BE WORTH PURSUING IF THE CCC CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THE BENEFITS ARE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THAT ONGOING OPERATIONAL COSTS. AND THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THESE FACILITIES. AND THAT WE ALSO I RECOMMEND YOU REQUIRE THIS ISSUE CEDAR REPORT ON OUTCOMES JIM FOR LONGER TERM POLICY CHOICES. GREAT THANK YOU FINANCE HOUSING HEREDEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITH REGARD TO ISSUE ONE WE WANT TO NOTE THAT WE SUPPORT THE. ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR ONGOING FUNDING FOR THE TRANSITION SERVICES. THANK YOU MISTER CITED YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING HAVING HEARD THE COMMENTS OF LEO.

IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND BEFORE THE RECESSION THE EACH OF THE QUORUM FOR EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL CORES USED TO GET AROUND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE STATE FOR THESE EXACT SERVICES. HOWEVER WITH THE RECESSION THEY ARE NOW ONLY RECEIVING AROUND TWENTY THOUSAND EACH SO THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD REALLY HELP THEM. PROVIDE I'M ALL THE PIECES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO EACH OF THOSE YOUTH I'M REACHING THEIR FULL POTENTIAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION. WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE NOW THAT. UNDER THE DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION THAT. DELTA TRAIL MASTER PLAN. ENORMOUS FUNDING REQUEST. WITH SOME BIG IMPACT OF PLEASE GREATER ST LEOMINSTER CHAIR THAT. PLEASED TO BE HERE MY NAME IS ERICA BANK I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION. AND WE DON'T OFTEN APPEAR BEFORE THIS SUBCOMMITTEE APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO COME AND EXPLAIN OUR. BUDGET REQUEST HERE TODAY GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE COMMISSION IT'S ALWAYS APPRECIATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INFORM PEOPLE OF WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO. FORM DE THE COMMISSION WAS FORMED IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO OVER CONCERNED ABOUT URBANIZATION AT THE PERIPHERY OF THE DELTA. AND ONE OF THE EARLY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMISSION WAS TO PREPARE A LAND USE PLAN FOR THE DELTA THAT WOULD. GUIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAND USE PLANNING DECISIONS AND THE COMMISSION ACTUALLY COULD. ON OCCASION IF IT FOUND A LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAND USE DECISIONS WERE. INCONSISTENT WITH THAT PLAN COULD OVERRULE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF LAND USE DECISIONS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THEIR WORLD IN THE DELTA CHANGED. LEGISLATION WAS. ADOPTED TO CREATE ARE THAT THAT A FELLOW AGENCY THE DELTA STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL WHICH THEN HAD RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING THAT. THE STATEMENT IT'S TWO GOALS FOR THE DELTA A RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY AND RESTORATION OF THE DELTA ECO SYSTEM. BUT TO ACCOMPLISH THOSE IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS AND ENHANCES THE UNIQUE DELTA VALUES. AND THAT'S OUR PRIMARY. RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMMISSION NOW IS TO IN. HELP ADVISE THE STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL ON HOW BEST TO PROTECT AND ENHANCE THE UNIQUE DELTA VALUES. AND THE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED THE GREAT CALIFORNIA DELTA TRAIL ACT. AND THAT A CHARGE THE COMMISSION WITH CREATING A TRAIL THROUGH THE DELTA TO CONNECT THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY TRAIL. AT THE FAR WESTERN INTO THE DELTA WITH THE SACRAMENTO RIVER TRAIL NOT TOO FAR OUTSIDE OF OUR AT THIS BUILDING HERE. ALONG THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF OUR REQUEST YOU TODAY IS REGARDING MASTER PLANNING FOR THAT GREAT CALIFORNIA DELTA TRAIL. THAT COULD GOOD REPRESENTATION ARE JUST THE GENERAL PRESENTATION AND I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO DETAIL ON THE ITEM BEFORE YOU. A PICTURE ETCHER PROP HAVE LEGISLATION AND A IN A IN A MOMENT THAT TO WILL GIVE YOU THATTO AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT OF THAT OPPORTUNITY BUT JUDGES ALEJO HAVE CONTACT MITCHELL IS WITH LA WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PURPOSE FINANCE ASSUME NO COMMENTS. I. SO CAN YOU JUST. DESCRIBE. WHAT THIS AMOUNT OF THIS IS A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR? ALLOCATION BUT WHAT WILL THAT FUNDING CA HELP YOU ACCOMPLISH SO THAT THE REQUEST IS FOR. TOOK TO CREATE A MASTER PLAN FOR THAT THAT DELTA TRAIL WE DO HAVE. EXCUSE ME WE DO HAVE DESIGNATED SEGMENTS OF THE TRAIL AT THE EDGES OF. OF THE DELTA THE THE EDGES OF THE DELTA ARE. GENERALLY URBAN AREAS AND SO WE DO HAVE DESIGNATED SITES. TRAIL SEGMENTS THAT EXIST WITHIN. THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO OF PORTIONS OF THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO ARE. WITHIN THE LEGAL DELTA. WITHIN THE CITY OF WEST SACRAMENTO. LIKEWISE LOCATED WITHIN THE LEGAL DELTA. AND THEN ALL THE WAY AT THE FAR END OF THE DELTA AT SEGMENTS DESIGNATED WITHIN. CITIES IN EASTERN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SO THESE ARE TRAIL SEGMENTS THAT. EXISTS THROUGH URBAN AREAS. THEY WERE DEVELOPED BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WE'VE. BUT OUR SEAL ON THEM AND AND ADOPTED THEM THE SEGMENTS OF THE GREAT CALIFORNIA DELTA TRAIL. THERE'S A LOT OF CONNECTION THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR BETWEEN THOSE TWO URBAN AREAS AT THE FAR ENDS OF THE DELTA. AND THE PURPOSE OF THE REQUEST TODAY IS TO COMPLETE AMASTER PLAN. FOR THAT MORE DIFFICULT. THAT HAD SEGMENT ACT CONNECTING WHAT'S LARGELY RURAL LANDS IN BETWEEN. THE URBAN AREAS AT THE PERIPHERY OF THE DELTA. THERE'S ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO CLARIFY THE STATUTE THAT. UNDER THE CURRENT STATUTE SAYS. WE CAN ONLY REQUEST FUNDING FOR THIS MAN. WE ARE WE CAN ONLY COMPLETE WHEN WE HAVE ALL THE FUNDING AMASSED. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE CREATING THE TRAIL SEGMENTS OURSELVES WE ANTICIPATE WORKING WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. IN THERE TRANSPORTATION AND AND TRAIL PLANNING EFFORTS. TO HELP GUIDE THE CREATION OF THIS IN THEN TO DESIGNATE THOSE SEGMENTS BUT WE DON'T INTEND OURSELVES TO BE OUT THERE WITH. HEAVY EQUIPMENT. YOU KNOW BLEEDING BLEEDING A TRAIL FOR THIS THROUGH THE INTERIOR PART OF THE DELTA. SO THAT. AT THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE MASTER PLAN. WILL BE. MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL BE COLLABORATING TO FILL IN THE PIECES OF THE. UP OF THE TRAILS WHO I AM OVERTIME THAT'S PRETTY CAN BE PRETTY HARD THAT TO PROTECT. BASED ON FUNDING SOURCES ANOTHER A. POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS WHEN THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY. BECOME A REALITY. YEAH I IT IT IT WE AT WE DON'T HAVE A PREDICTION FOR WHEN THIS. ULTIMATE LINKAGE WILL OCCUR. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ULTIMATELY SOME OF IT MIGHT. NOT EVEN BEYOND ROAD SEGMENTS YOU KNOW WE HAVE. MANY MANY MILES OF WATERWAYS THAT TRAVERSE THROUGH THE DELTA. A WATER TRAIL IS A POSSIBILITY FOR PORTIONS OF THIS. BUT OF COURSE THE WHAT WE HOPE TO DO IS TO CONNECTED THROUGH. OF LAND SEGMENTS BECAUSE THAT'S PRIMARILY HOW YOU KNOW PEOPLE WOULD. RECREATION TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THIS REGION. ON A TRAIL WHETHER IT BE ON BIKER FOOT TUMOR EVEN. POTENTIALLY EQUESTRIAN USES WELL WHAT SO MANY OF FIVE THESE PLANS IN THE THE ONE THAT COMES TO MIND FOR ME IS VIA COASTAL TRAIL. I'M A IT. TAKE DECADES TO. AT A TO BUILD OUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO. SEE IF WE CAN'T FIND A WAY TO ACCELERATE THE PROCESS OF THAT IT DOESN'T TAKE MANY DECADES. PERHAPS COULD TAKE OF A MUCH SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME. SO SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT HOW AS AS WE GO FORWARD YOU MENTIONED DUH. ANOTHER WORD URBANIZATION THEN. I ASSUME THAT'S A A CODE WORD FOR. AYE ENCROACHING DEVELOPMENT ON ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS THAT WAS TAKING PLACE IN THE PAST IS THAT. FAIRLY ACCURATE THAT THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE THE OF WHAT WAS OCCURRING IN THE EARLY LATE EIGHTIES INTO THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES THAT LED TO THE ADOPTION OF THE. DELTA PROTECTION ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHAT CERTAINLY TRUE SINCE THAT TIME IS THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITHIN THE DELTA REGION AND THERE ARE FIVE COUNTIES THAT. BOB PRIMARILY HAVE THE LAND USE JURISDICTION OVER WHAT WE CALLED PRIMARY ZONE OF THE DELTA. THEY'VE ALL EMBRACED THE. OUR IN OUR PLAN FOR THE DELTA AT. AND WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THAT EMBRACING THAT PLANET WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE. DIFFICULT TO GET AROUND IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT FURTHER INCURSION OF URBANIZATION. INTO THE INTERIOR DELTA AND IT STE TO THIS DAY REMAINS A. A REGION THAT'S AGRICULTURAL HAS A LOT OF NATURAL. RESOURCE VALUE A LOT OF NATURAL. OF FEATURES STILL INTACT BUT THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. I THINK I GIVEN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE LAST FEW YEARS ON WITH FIRE AND AND AND AND FLOODING IN EVEN THE RECENT MUDSLIDES WERE. LEARNING THAT TO HER OF OVER MANY MANY YEARS WE'VE UP. ALLOWED TO HAVE BUILDING TO TAKE PLACE IN SOME AREAS WHERE IT'S JUST REALLY NOT A GOOD IDEA. AND I THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE YET TO REALLY GET A HANDLE ON ALTHOUGH A ENOUGH AT THE AREA OF YOUR JURISDICTION IT SOUNDS LIKE A. THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME PROGRESS ON THAT WOULD. MIGHT BE USEFUL TO. OF FIND A WAY FOR OTHER TO BE SOME STATEWIDE COLLABORATION ON WHAT TYPE BEST PRACTICES ARE IN THAT REGARD SO WE BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT. THIS ISSUE HOLISTICALLY. A IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR INDIVIDUAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO A. A. IT TOOK TOOK THE TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT ISSUE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE GOTTA. OF PROGRESS ON. HAD ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. TO HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE SPRINGS INTO ACTION. THEN THE. WELCOME MR PATTERSON WE WILL THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND IT. LET'S TAKE ROLES AS WE GOT. A GOOD IDEA WILL FORMER CORRECT AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A COMMITTEE OR WHAT. BLOOM. HERE FONG. KALRA. MULLIN. PATTERSON. IS SAID ISSUE THREE AND ISSUE THAT.

HE GOOD MORNING CHAIR BLOOM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAN TELL WHAT DIRECTOR OF HELLFIRE AND I DO WISH TO OPEN BY JUST ECHOING DIRECTORS SIDE THOSE COMMENTS ABOUT. FIRE SEASON TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE ALL FACED AS A STATE AND JUST REALLY WANT TO. EMPHASIZE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS IN THEIR EFFORTS OF THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN. OF THAT ORGANIZATION THAT TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE NOT ONLY IN THE RESPONSE TO THESE FIRES BUT TO THE WORK THEY DO EVERYDAY. ARE IN RESOURCE PROTECTION OF FUELS TREATMENT FIRE PREVENTION AND ALL OF THAT WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. BUT BEFORE YOU TODAY I'D NUMBER FIVE EVER ARE A VARIETY OF CAPITAL OUTLAY. PROJECTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS BRINGING FORWARD A AND THIS IT REALLY STEMS FROM THE BOOK LONGSTANDING BACKLOG OF MAINTENANCE NEEDS. ARE WITHIN CAL FIRES FACILITIES WHICH THREE QUARTERS OF WHICH. BILL PRIOR TO NINETEEN FIFTY. ARE IN A VARIETY OF PROJECTS THERE IN PARTICULAR. SUCH AS. ARE MOVING FIRE STATION OR PUTTING A FIRE STATION ARE IN THE NORTH END OF CONTRA COSTA COUNTY ODD PROVIDE PROTECTION IN A CRITICAL AREA OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR. OUR PARTNERS IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY UP BUT THAT THE PROJECTS THERE SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON ITEM FIVE. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF. ALL OF CALIFORNIA. PRESENTATIONS. IS THERE A. DESIRE TO HAVE A MOTION ON THIS ITEM. THIS ISSUE NUMBER FIVE WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU. WELL. I FALL. KALRA MULLIN. PATTERSON. GREAT THANK YOU ISSUE NUMBER SIX ISSUE NUMBER SIX IS A MOBILE EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT. PROGRAM BUDGET THIS REQUESTS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE REPLACEMENT. OF CAL FIRE. MOBILE EQUIPMENT A CALIFORNIA HAS ALMOST THIRTY IVE HUNDRED VEHICLES THAT INCLUDES OUR FIRE ENGINES BULLDOZERS AND THE VARIETY OF SUPPORT EQUIPMENT. OUR CHIEF OFFICERS FORESTERS AND OTHERS UTILIZE. AND AGAIN WITH THE FIRE SEASON THAT OUT LAST YEAR ROUND THIS EQUIPMENT IS BEING USED UP EVERY DAY. NOT ONLY FOR RESPONSE TO WILDLAND FIRES BUT FOR THE FIRE PREVENTION AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT MISSION. THE DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INCLUDING UP WORK ON PRESCRIBED FIRE AND OTHER FUELS PROJECTS. OUR OUR CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY THAT WERE THAT WE UTILIZE ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION OB WORK TOWARDS REPLACING IN MOVING THIS EQUIPMENT OUT OF FRONT LINE SERVICE. AFTER TEN YEARS AND THEN ULTIMATELY MOVING IT OUT OF RESERVE STATUS AFTER TWENTY. IT'S NOT JUST THE YEAR CYCLE BUT IT'S ALSO THE AMOUNT OF WORKLOAD THESE VEHICLES EQUIPMENT HAVE IN TERMS OF OFF ROAD USE PUMPING AND ALL THE STRESSES THAT ARE PLACED IN THE ENVIRONMENTS THAT WE. OPERATE IN SO THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING A ONE TIME FUNDING OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. VOWED TO ALLOW US TO START INCREMENTALLY DECREASING OF THE BACKLOG. TO START INCREASING OUR REPLACEMENT CYCLE. Q.. THE BOTTOM. WHAT WOULD IT TAKE? TO. A BRING EVERYTHING. TO. STUFF OR YOU KNOW AS. A AND. I'M NOT TO. SURE EXACTLY HOW TO SAY THIS YEAR YOUR YOUR BEHIND SCHEDULE IN TERMS OF. THE IDEAL REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO BRING YOU CURRENT ON EVERYTHING. SO THE BATTERED CURRENTLY APPEARANCE. I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT NUMBER BE OBVIOUSLY CAME IN IN WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO GET US BACK TO BUT WE'VE HISTORICALLY BEEN FUNDED AT IN OUR MOBILE EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT BUDGET. TO TO REALLY WORK TOWARDS THE FORTY THREE PERCENT. FIVE DEFICIT THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF. WHERE WERE AT IN THE REDUCTION OR IN IN THAT? BEING BEHIND THAT THE POWER CURVE IF YOU WILL ON REPLACEMENT. OKAY WELL I'VE. IF A A IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO GET THAT NUMBER ACTUALLY WHAT WILL HAVE STAFF FOLLOW UP WITH A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME IN NUMBERS FOR WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO BRING US INTO COMPLIANCE WITH HARASSMENT SCANDAL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S UP. PROBABLY RIGHT NOW AND I UNDERSTAND WHY PROBABLY. ALL THE FLEETS STATEWIDE. A IN EVERY DEPARTMENT ARE STILL BEHIND SCHEDULE. I'VE GOT COMING OUT OF THE RECESSION. AND WERE PLAYING CATCH UP AND FREQUENTLY IT'S THE% STUFF FLEETS THAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE TAKE THE LONGEST TO CATCH UP ON. THAT. BECAUSE THAT'S TO INCUR COSTS ON THE MAINTENANCE SIDE BECAUSE IT'S THINGS AGE THEY TAKE MORE MAINTENANCE AT LEAST THAT'S THE CASE IN MY EXPERIENCE I WOULD IMAGINE GIVEN THE. USAGE OF. OF YOUR VEHICLES THAT'S PROBABLY EVEN MORE SO BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT GIVEN THE. INCREASING. A NEED FOR YOUR DEPARTMENT TO BE READY AND DE AT TO. MAXIMUM. CAPACITY IN MAXIMUM READING HAS THAT WE SHOULD. AT LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT AMOUNT OF MONEY IT WOULD TAKE TO GET YOU TO THAT PLACE WHERE I YEAR OF THE IDEAL PLACE IN TERMS OF THE. REPLACEMENT OF YOUR OVERALL EQUIPMENT. SO I'D I'D LIKE TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN PENDING RECEIPT OF THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE WE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AN AUGMENTATION TO GET YOU TO THAT PLACE OR AT LEAST CLOSER TO IT. MR MON. THEY MISTER. THE CHIEF JUST CURIOUS WHAT A HELLA TENDER IS. NEVER THAT TERM. SO I HELOTIALES A SUPPORT UNIT FOR A HELICOPTER. HELICOPTER CAN ONLY CARRY SO MUCH IN TERMS OF ITS CREW ABOUT WATER AND THE OTHER FIREFIGHTING EQUIPMENT THAT THE CREW MEMBERS NEED ON THE HELICOPTER. BUT IT REQUIRES SUPPORT FUEL. ADDITIONAL WATER DROPPING BUCKETS. OTHER SUPPORT ITEMS THAT FOLLOW. NEEDED TO SUPPORT THAT VEHICLE RESPONDS SOMEONE HELICOPTERS DEPLOYED IT OFF TO GET TO THE FIRE FIRST BECAUSE OF THE FLIGHT TIME. BEGINS ITS OPERATION THE HELL ATENDER SUPPORT UNIT I FOLLOW SUIT ON THE GROUND ARRIVES AT THE INCIDENT THEY SET UP ESSENTIALLY A HELLA BASE SO THAT ALL OF THE SUPPORT MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT. OF THE HELICOPTER WHEN IT LANDS FOR REFUELING I NEED MINOR MAINTENANCE OR OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NEEDED ON THE GROUND ALL THAT IS SUPPORTED BY. THAT TELETECH UNIT. THAT SUFFER THE RECORD THAT'S H. E. L. I. A H. E. L. L. A WOULD BE A DIFFERENT YEAH THANK YOU HAVE BUT. OKAY ENOUGH FOR MY SENSE OF HUMOR. A. LET'S THAT WE'RE GONNA HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN. AND CERTAINLY HAVE A CONSIDERATE TO AN UPCOMING MEETING. AND THAT. WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN. ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN IS A CRITICAL AND ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT POINTING TOWARDS FRONTLINE RESOURCES AND FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT THAT WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT IN NEED PARTICULAR WITH THE CHALLENGING FIRE SEASONS. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT THE ENTIRE OVERALL OPERATION. OUT LOGISTICALLY WITH. FIRE SEASONS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER AND MUCH BUSIER WITH MORE FIRE ACTIVITY AND MORE COMPLEX FIRES WERE ORDERING RESOURCES. NOT ONLY FROM ALL OVER CALIFORNIA FROM LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES BUT FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. OTHER STATES IN FEDERAL AGENCIES AS WELL AS EVEN INTERNATIONALLY IN THIS CASE LAST YEAR AUSTRALIA. ARE ALL ABOUT REQUIRES PROCUREMENT AGREEMENTS ARE BEING UTILIZED A SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD INCREASE IN PROVIDING THE SUPPORT FIREFIGHTERS NEED FROM. WATER FIRE HOSE. FOOD POISON OAK MEDICINE. WE'RE LITERALLY RUNNING CITIES ARE OUT THERE AND THE CITIES CAN BE DEPLOYED FOR A MONTH OR MORE. UP ALL THAT REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT LOGISTICAL SUPPORT. AND DAY TO DAY PROCUREMENT OF THESE RESOURCES THIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE WORKLOAD. OUR EVERYDAY ARE ON OUR ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF US STATEWIDE SO UP ITEM NUMBER SEVEN REQUEST ACCOUNTING STAFFING AND INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT. OUR OF. TWENTY ONE AT POSITIONS TO ADDRESS THIS NEED MANY OF THESE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN FUNDED. ARE FROM YEAR TO YEAR ARE BASED ON AUGMENTATION BUT IT'S CLEAR THIS IS THE NEW NORMANDY SUPPOSITIONS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR LIST. EXCESSIVELY PAY OUR BILLS ON TIME AND SUPPORT THE FIREFIGHTERS ON THE GROUND TO GET THEM WITH THE. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. DIRECTORA AS YOU KNOW. YOU. PROVIDED ME WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE. A WHATEVER BASIS DURING THE. THOMAS FIRE THAT WAS THAT THE. OF INTER THAT COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS AND I FOUND TO. OF THE EXPERIENCE TO BE VERY ILLUMINATING AND EDUCATIONAL. BUT THE FULL RANGE OF NOT JUST THE. A RESPONSE THAT TO ALL THE AGENCIES INCLUDING YOURS. UP A PROVIDE BUT THE SCALE OF IT AND THE ABILITY TO RAMP UP QUICKLY. AND I'D JUST LIKE TO ENCOURAGE ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF I DON'T WANNA. I PREDICT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE AN EXTROVERT BUT I THINK WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE ANOTHER VAN HOPEFULLY NOT ON THE SCALE. OF OF THE FIRES THAT WE SAW OVER THE. OVER THE LAST YEAR AND BUT IF YOU COULD WORK WITH EACH OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME AND WHEN IT'S NOT AN IMPOSITION ON THE. WORK RICHARD DOING OUT IN THE OUT IN THE FIELD ON I THINK WILL BE VERY USEFUL FOR A FOR EVERYONE TO SEE THAT. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE MEMBERS COME OUT AND. KICKED OPPORTUNITY VISIT INCIDENT BASIS OR EVEN SOME OF OUR SMALLER. FIRES THAT OCCUR WERE PERHAPS. THANK YOU THAT IS OUR MOTION ON THIS ITEM. YES MISTER MALLOY.

THE THIRTY FOUR POSITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED AS ON GOING. SEASONAL FIRE CAPTAIN'S THIS WAS AGAIN A DIRECT RESULT OF THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN WORKLOAD THAT'S BEEN OCCURRING ALL OF OUR EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTERS THE TWENTY ONE. FRONTLINE CAL FIRE EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL AS OUR TO. REGIONAL COORDINATION CENTER IS THE ONE IN RIVERSIDE AND READING AND THEN OUR SENTIMENTO COORDINATION CENTER. HERE. AT MAJOR CO LOCATED WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. UP A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CALL VOLUME WHEN ONE FIRE I WON WILDLAND FIRE OCCURS WE MAY GET AS MANY AS FOUR HUNDRED CELLULAR TELEPHONE CALLS COMING INTO OUR EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTER. REPORTING THAT ONE CALL IN THE CASE OF THE OCTOBER. FIRE SIEGE IN THE NORTH BAY OUR COMMAND CENTER IN ST HALINA. NOT RECEIVED ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND. PHONE CALLS ARE OVER THE COURSE OF A FORTY EIGHT HOUR PERIOD IN THIS WORK RANGING FROM LITERALLY OUR COMMAND CENTER STAFF. WALKING AND TALKING FIRE ENGINE COMPANY OFFICERS INTO. HOMEOWNERS WHILE THEY HAD THEM ON THE PHONE WHO WERE IN PERIL. TRYING TO CONNECT THEM UP IN AN EXTREMELY SMOKY CONDITIONS IT'S ALSO EXPANDING WHEN A FIRE LARGE FIRE DOES OCCUR OUR COMMAND CENTER IS THE ORDERING POINT FOR ALL OF THE RESOURCES. THEY GET ORDERED INTO THAT EMERGENCY SO WE HAVE TO RAPIDLY EXPAND THAT COMMAND CENTER SO THEY HAVE STAFF TO PROCESS ENGAGING ORDERING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FIRE ENGINES. LOGISTICS ALL OF THAT UP THROUGH AUGMENTATION WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT. A THE THESE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND IT'S CLEAR AS WE GO INTO THIS NEW NORMAL THESE THIS IS THE PACE AND SCALE WHICH WHICH WE ARE NOW OPERATING. TO ASSN TO MAKE ALL OF THOSE AUGMENTED POSITIONS PERMANENT. SO THIS IS REALLY JUST A RECOGNITION OF REALITY TO. THAT WERE PREDICTING THAT GOING FORWARD WE'RE GOING TO BE SAYING OF MORE EVENTS AND MORE YEAR ROUND EVENTS CORRECT. ANY QUESTIONS. YES WHAT OPTIONS DO WE HAVE TO FUND THESE KINDS OF THINGS GOING FOR HIM AND I WILL CERTAINLY SUPPORT THIS IN AND THE NEED IS IS? CLEAR. JUST. I GUESS I'M CONCERNED JUST IN THE OUT YEARS IF WE DO YOU ENTER A DEFICIT KIND OF A POSITION AS ANY THOUGHT BEING GIVEN TO YOU KNOW. HOW WE MAINTAIN THESE EXPENDITURES ACT GOING FORWARD? IS A VERY GENERAL QUESTION FORTIETH AND AND. MAYBE UNANSWERABLE BUT UP I THOUGHT I'D PUT IT OUT THERE SINCE WHERE. COMMITTEE OURSELVES REALLY TO AN ONGOING. SIGNATURE. VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I WOULD CERTAINLY DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR LONG TERM YOU KNOW PLANNING WHEN IT COMES TO THE FUNDING I'M MECHANISMS FOR THE STATE BUDGET BUT I WILL TELL YOU FROM. THE DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE THE FIRE PROTECTION CAPABILITIES THAT WORD NOT ONLY ASKING FOR HERE TODAY BUT WE'VE BEEN SUPPORT AGAIN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ARE CRITICAL. TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES WE NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF FIRES ARE CAUSED BY PEOPLE THE PART WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BOTH THE NUMBER OF FIRES ON AVERAGE THAT ARE OCCURRING THROUGHOUT. THE STATE AS WELL AS THE HAVE SIZE AND AND IN A CREEK THERE BEING BURNED THIS TREND ISN'T CHANGING IT'S NOT DECREASING IT'S ONLY. GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW SO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT. THE PRESSURE CONTINUES TO COME BACK ON OUR FIREFIGHTERS TO TO TO MEET THIS THIS IMPACT AS THE WORKLOAD INCREASES WERE ASKING THESE FIREFIGHTERS AND SUPPORT PEOPLE TO CONTINUE. TO WORK HARDER AND HARDER EVERY DAY UP WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY NOT WHERE WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY. AND CRITICAL TO PROVIDE THAT LONG TERM SUPPORT AND ENSURE THAT IT'S HERE AND READILY IN WHAT PREPARED IN THE BUDGET TO INSURANCE CONSISTENT. THANK YOU LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE THE MCCLELLAN RELOAD BASE. SO I'M A CO AND RELOAD BASIS A FACILITY. RIGHT HERE IN OF THE SACRAMENTO REGION THAT MCCLELLAN. AIRPORT IT HAS BEEN OPERATED. ALMOST ON THE SEASON TO SEASON BASSIST WE'VE AGAIN RECEIVE DROUGHT AUGMENTATION TO HAVE SEASONAL STAFFING THERE THE BASE HAS PROVEN INVALUABLE. TO SUPPORT CAL FIRES AND OUR PARTNERS AT THE FOR SERVICE. FIRE SUPPRESSION EFFORTS ARE THROUGHOUT. CALIFORNIA AND NOT JUST THE GREATER REGION AROUND SACRAMENTO. THIS AIRPORT NOT ONLY CAN SUPPORT CAL FIRES AIR TANKERS BUT SUPPORTS BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE. UP A LARGE AND VERY LARGE AIR TANKERS THAT WERE NOW UTILIZING A IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT INCLUDES THE SEVEN FORTY SEVEN WHICH CAN DELIVER ALMOST TWENTY THOUSAND GALLONS OF RETARDANT. AB ONE. FLIGHT OR OR ONE DROP UP WE CAN ACTUALLY OPERATE THAT AIRCRAFT ANYWHERE IN THE STATE FROM MCCLELLAN AND INDEED WAS UTILIZEDON A NUMBER OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES. BECAUSE OF THE SHORTENED FLIGHT TIMES IN AND ITS ABILITY TO OBVIOUSLY MOVE MOVE QUICKLY INTO PLOY. AGAIN WE'VE BEEN. STANDING THAT UP THROUGH AUGMENTATION BUT THIS IS A YEAR ROUND ALMOST YEAR ROUND ACTIVITY AGAIN IN DECEMBER ON THE THOMAS FIRE WE WERE ACTIVELY FLYING AIRCRAFT. FROM MCCLELLAN TO SUPPORT THOSE FIRES IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL REPRESSIVE BILLY TO STAFF THAT FOR UP TO AT LEAST NINE MONTHS. BOB PERMANENTLY SO WE HAVE THAT ABILITY TO SUPPORT THESE YEAR ROUND OPERATIONS THANK YOU QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE. OF CHART MISTER CRADDICK IS THAT IS IS THAT SEVEN FORTY SEVEN. CALIFORNIA EQUIPMENT OR IS IT. TOO TO HAVE TO. WAIT IN LINE TO GET SOMETIMES IF THEY'RE OTHER FIRES GOING ON OTHER PLACES WHAT KIND OF A. RAPID AVAILABILITY. WHEN WE HAVE A. THANK EXPLOSIVE FIRE THAT THAT REQUIRES IT. SO IT'S ARE OBVIOUSLY A PRIVATE VENDOR AND IT IS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A UNDER AN EXCLUSIVE USE WE UTILIZE A THROUGH WHAT WE CALL CALL WHEN NEEDED. AND IT IS AVAILABLE. TO THE FOR SERVICE POTENTIALLY TO OTHER STATES. AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA I WILL TELL YOU WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE VENDOR COMMUNITY AND OUR PARTNERS AT THE FOREST SERVICE WHO ARE THE LARGEST USERS OF THESE AIRCRAFT. COORDINATE AT THEIR USE AND ACTIVELY IN WHERE THE FIRE ACTIVITY IS AND HOW WE CAN BRING THEM. INTO WHERE WE NEED THEM IN ADDITION TO THE SEVEN FORTY SEVEN WE HAVE ACCESS TO. OTHER LARGER TANKERS THE DO YOU SEE TENS THERE ARE THREE OR FOUR THOSE ARE AVAILABLE AS WELL AS NUMEROUS LARGE AIR TANKERS THESE ARE DECISIONS WE LOOK AT AND MAKE EVERY. YEAR AND THROUGHOUT FIRE SEASON TO WHERE WE CAN BEST PUT THOSE BUT CERTAINLY THEY ARE SUBJECT. OUGHT TO OTHER DECISIONS AND OTHER USE AND CERTAINLY NOT JUST IN THE UNITED STATES DURING FIRE SEASON IN THE OPPOSITE HEMISPHERE. THEY ARE UTILIZED BY AUSTRALIA. AND OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL. HAVE YOU RUN INTO AVAILABILITY. ISSUES. THAT HAVE EITHER SIGNIFICANTLY ARE MARGINALLY AFFECTED. THEIR AVAILABILITY AND THEIR USE AT CRITICAL TIMES WHEN WE NEEDED THEM. UP CERTAINLY WHEN WERE IN FIRE SEASON THROUGHOUT THE WEST INTERMOUNTAIN WEST. AND CALIFORNIA AND NORTHWEST OF ALL FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES ARE CERTAINLY IMPACTED WE ELECT WERE AT ONE POINT DURING THE FIRE SIEGES IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN. YOU HAVE PUBLIC CLOSE TO TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FIREFIGHTERS ON THE FIRE LINE. UP AS WELL AS ALL OF THE AIRCRAFT THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE COUNTRY AND FROM OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. ARE DEPLOYED BECAUSE THERE ARE A LIMITED RESOURCE ALL OF THOSE ARE VERY CLOSELY COORDINATED. BETWEEN OUR PARTNERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AT THE BOISE ON THE NATIONAL FIRE CENTER THERE IN BOISE. UP TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE HAD ACCESS TO EVERY AVAILABLE AIRCRAFT IN THE COUNTRY. WERE MADE AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA UTILIZED EVERY RESOURCE WE THAT WE NEEDED ABOUT WAS WAS BE UTILIZED AS APPROPRIATE BUT THESE ARE OF COURSE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS AND THE NEXT GENERATION AVIATION FLEET. IS RAPIDLY EMERGING WHAT'S WERE FINDING AND PRICKLY AS OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS NO LOOK AT NEW AIRCRAFT THAT WE ARE MOVING INTO. THAT MANY MORE JET AIRCRAFT AND WORKING ON BRINGING NEW PLATFORMS FOR AND CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT THERE ARE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO. IDENTIFY THOSE NEW AIRCRAFT IN THE SEVEN FORTY SEVEN IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OUT WE LEAD THE CHARGE WITH THE FOREST SERVICE TO ENSURE. THAT THE SEVEN FORTY SEVEN ABOUT HAD WHAT IT NEEDED TO BE CARDED AND UTILIZED AS FIREFIGHTING AIRCRAFT. IN CALIFORNIA SO WE CONTINUE TO. TO WORK WITH THEM TO ENSURE ALL THESE AIRCRAFT HAPPENING ARE COMMITTED TO CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU.ISSUE NUMBER TEN OUR FINAL ISSUE. IS SAID THE. SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS REPLACEMENT PROGRAM. SO SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS THIS IS. PROPOSAL TO OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS UP WHOLESALE REPLACE CAL FIRES A SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. OF TO THAT THE NEW CURRENT STANDARD AND THAT BRINGS UP INC COMPLIANCE WITH THE NFPA NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION STANDARDS. ARE AS WELL AS THE INTER OPERABILITY NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE FIRE SERVICE THESE ARE THAT THE FRONTLINE PIECES OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT THAT FIREFIGHTERS USE WHEN THEY'RE. RESPONDING TO ANY. DANGEROUS OUR ATMOSPHERE AND YET EVEN OUR IN OUR WILDLAND FIREFIGHTERS ARE OTHER FIVE ALL OF OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND CAL FIRE RESPOND ALL TYPES OF FIRES VEHICLE FIRES. UP START WILDLAND FIRES AND SO IT'S CRITICAL THAT OUR FIREFIGHTERS HAVE. PROTECTION FROM THE TOXINS THAT COME FROM ALL THESE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS AND NOW BRINGING UP THE STANDARD SO THAT WE MEET ALL OF THE CURRENT. HAZARDS MATERIALS GUIDELINES IF THE EQUIPMENT IS NOT STATE OF THE ART SO PROVIDES OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR FIREFIGHTERS AND INTER OPERABLE WITH OUR FIRE SERVICE. PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SINCE WE ALL RESPOND INTERCHANGEABLY THROUGH THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. ON ON CALLS TOGETHER TO THIS MALL OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS REPLACE ALL OF THOSE WITH THE CURRENT STANDARD IN PROVIDING ONGOING MAINTENANCE. A PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT EQUIPMENT IS MAINTAINED TO THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD. AND THE END OF THE YEAR VIEW DOES THIS ALLOCATION AND THE ABOUT THE PROGRAM THAT IT REPRESENTS. PROVIDE THE. THE APPROPRIATE A REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE OR IS THERE A A IS A SPIKE THAT PRIOR ITEM IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS. I'M TAKING A LITTLE BIT LONGER BECAUSE OF. THE PERCEIVED LACK OF FOR OF FOLK ONETIME RESOURCES. NO I'M VERY PLEASED WITH THIS REPLACEMENT CYCLE ADDED THREE AND THAT'S APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS TO GET THESE REPLACED. LOGISTICALLY STRUCTURALLY THAT WOULD WORK WELL FOR US ANYWAY AS WE CYCLE THESE THROUGH SOME VERY HAPPY WITH THIS GREAT GREAT FENDER MADE WE CAN NOW MOVE THIS ITEM FORWARD LET'S TAKE A THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. LET'S TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. ON. ALL OF THE CALIFORNIA ITEMS ANY OR ALL OF THEM. RICHARD GARRETT JR BLOOM COMMITTEE. AND DIRECTOR. YEAH IT IT SHOULD BE A. IS OBVIOUS THAT. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY. CAL FIRE. THIS IS A FOREMOST STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE FIRE PROTECTION IN THE UNITED STATES. AND IF NOT IN THE WORLD AS AN ENTITY ITSELF. AND PART OF THE SERVER JUNIOR COUSIN OF A CALIFORNIA. IS A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT DIVISION. AND I THINK BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF TALK THERE'S LEGISLATION. BUT FOREST HELPED IN DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES IN A COMPREHENSIVE MANNER. ALLOW THIS GOES BACK TO RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IS REALLY DIFFICULT. THEY HAVE THE KIND OF FOCUS IT'S NEEDED A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT'S EASY. THIS IS A MAJOR EMERGENCY BITING. AGENCY. AT SOME OF THE. BASIC PROBLEMS. STAND BACK GUY IF NOT FIFTEEN YEARS EVEN MORE BUT YOU ALL SHOULD REMEMBER I LOVE. SAYING THIS TO DIVERSE AUDIENCES IN THEN HERE THE GAS DOES HAVE MORE IMPACTS. THAT WAS IN EFFECT FROM NINETEEN FORTY SIX TO NINETEEN. OF SEVENTY SIX WHEREBY FOREST LANDOWNERS OUR TAX EVERY YEAR UNDERSTANDING TIMBER. UNTIL THEY CUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF IT. OKAY. SO THIS LATITUDE LEGACY PROBLEM WE HAVE TODAY. IN THE FIFTY FIVE AND SIXTY FOUR FLOODS. EXACERBATED THAT DAMNED EXTREMELY. SO AND. THERE WAS LEGISLATION. AND A BECAME LAW TWENTY TWELVE AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO. YOU TAKE NOTE OF THOSE NUMBERS. BUT IT GIVES AGO THRESHOLD A WATERSHED MOMENT. BECAUSE. AT. THAT BILL GAVE A CAPITA FORCE FOR A LIABILITY TO LANDOWNERS. EXTENDED TIME OF HARVEST PLANS AND CREATED A FUNDING SOURCE FOR FORCED REGULATION AND SO CALLED FOREST RESTORATION. I AND THE TAX AND RETAIL AMBER PRODUCTS. AND IT'S A BRING IN OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. SO IT ALSO CREATED AND A POSITIVE SIDE FOR A LOT OF PUBLIC. INTENSE TO ACTUALLY DEAL FORCE RESTORATION WATERSHED RESTORATION CARBON SEQUESTRATION ALL OF THIS AND SO I'M APPEARING BEFORE YOU TODAY. TO LOOK AT IT FROM A BUDGET BASIS AND I FEEL. I AND MANY OTHERS DO ALSO THAT THE ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDING. FOR THE FUNDING. THAT IT. PROMOTES THE PERSONALITY FOCUS. HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATE HEARING IRAN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND A LOT OF THE BASIC CHANGES ABOUT AT OBSERVED DATE DATA ORGANIZATION IS LIKE A LOT A TOWER OF BABEL. WITH THE DOOR EIGHT BETWEEN DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND BETWEEN FORESTERS AND YOU PUT INFORMATION ON HARVEST PLANS TO REPORT YOUR ISSUE DIFFERENT SYMBOLS. NEW THE IS A WHOLE NEED UPGRADING THAT THAT LEGISLATION WAS SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. SO. BERNIE IS RE SOME REALLOCATION AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'M FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE I'M. INVOLVED WITH THIS PILOT PROJECT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT PAYING TO HAVE. PLANNING WATERSHED PILOT PROJECTS TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT REAL HARVEST PLANS AN OPENING WATERSHED SCALE WHICH IS A SCALED A COMPLETE IMPACTS ARE CONSIDERED AT TO SEE WHAT'S WERE SAVING WITH WORTH. CHANGING TO MAKE IT A STREAMLINED PROCESS. TO DEAL WITH FORCE RESTORATION KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT HIGH GRADING OUR SIXTEEN INCH IN DIAMETER TREES. NO LISTEN SOME FAILURE TO ACTUALLY MAINTAIN THE KIND OF FORCED TO PEOPLE TALK ABOUT FORCED FELT. BITS OLD ENOUGH AND PROBABLY ENOUGH TO HELP TO SUPPRESS WILDFIRES IN TO GIVE ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL BENEFIT TO BE TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC INCLUDING LEGISLATURE. SO I WOULD THE ENCOURAGE YOU TO BECOME EDUCATED ON THAT I. HAD TO HAND OUT THERE ABOUT LAST CHANCE ABOUT MAYBE FOURTEEN NINETY TWO IN THE TIMBER REGULATION COURSE RESTORATION. OF FUND PROGRAM. AND AND. ROSS HENLEY WHO'S HERE WE COME THE TIMBERS ARE. USED TO BE A CAL FIRED HIS WAS RESOURCES AGING HOUSE FLUFFY PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN CAL EPA.
