WORK PRODUCTS COMMUNICATION.

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:52.758
PRODUCT TO BE TOOLS IN ADDITION

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:55.861
THE OFFICE OF INDEPENDENT

00:14:55.928 --> 00:14:58.897

YELLOW BOOK STANDARD. YELLOW

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:03.035
BOOK STANDARD DEEPER BY FOUR

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:05.037
AND REQUIRE A LEVEL OF

00:15:05.104 --> 00:15:06.872
INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE WORK

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:09.275
OF THE AUDITORS AND THE WORK

00:15:09.341 --> 00:15:12.444
THAT TO BE OUT OF IT. THERE ARE

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:14.313
EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:24.690
ABSOLUTELY IS A REQUIREMENT OF

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:27.393
THE YELLOW BOOK STANDARD AND

00:15:27.459 --> 00:15:29.161
FOR US TO FOLLOW SH SO THE

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:32.398

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:35.534
VESTED WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:39.271

THE SEPARATION OF THOSE DUTIES

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:53.018
OR THAT RESPONSIBILITY. I THINK

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:54.653
THAT I WOULD JUST STOP THERE IN

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.189

00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:03.796

00:45:43.674 --> 00:45:47.344
UNDERSTAND IT. UNLESS IF IT IF

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.313
IT INCREASES THE NUMBER OF

00:45:49.379 --> 00:45:51.081
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED NOW WHEN

KNOW. MOST OF OUR JOBS ARE IN A

00:45:58.021 --> 00:45:59.590
HIGHLY IN THE URBANIZED COASTAL

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:02.726

00:46:06.797 --> 00:46:10.134
HOUSING. THE HOUSING DEVELOPS

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.836
OUT WHERE I COME FROM. SO IT IS

00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:15.105
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO MOVE

00:46:15.172 --> 00:46:17.207
PEOPLE FROM WHERE I AM TO THE

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:19.443
JOBS UNTIL WE SOMEHOW BALANCE

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.411
OUT OUR JOBS NO WE HAVE A

00:46:21.478 --> 00:46:23.313
HOUSING POLICY THAT ENCOURAGES

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:26.917
HOUSING IN FACT REQUIRES

00:46:26.984 --> 00:46:28.652
HOUSING TO BE BUILT WHERE I AM.

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:31.955

00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:54.878
IS A STATE AND AS I SAID I

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:57.214
DON'T THINK THIS FALLS WITHIN

00:46:57.281 --> 00:46:59.082
THE C. D. C.'S PURVIEW. BUT AS

00:46:59.149 --> 00:47:00.717
