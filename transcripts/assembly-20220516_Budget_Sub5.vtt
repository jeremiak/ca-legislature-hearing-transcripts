OFFICE- IN OUR ANALYSIS IT IS

00:59:58.061 --> 01:00:00.063
UNCLEAR WHY- FEDERAL

01:00:00.129 --> 01:00:01.831
INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:03.399
CANNOT BE PRIORITIZED BY

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:05.735
EXISTING STATE AND REGIONAL DOJ

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:07.670
TASK FORCE IS WORKING WITH LOCAL

AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:11.040
AGENCIES. IT IS ALSO UNCLEAR

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:12.775
WHETHER THIS ACTIVITY IS THE

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:15.044
MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF ADDRESSING

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:16.879
THE FENNEL AND OPIOID CRISIS.

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:19.048
COLLABORATION ACROSS AGENCIES

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:20.516
SUCH AS COORDINATING WITH

EXISTING AND PROPOSED DATA

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:24.520
COLLECTION AND I REJECTED EASE

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:25.588
AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:27.724
PUBLIC HEALTH COULD INFORM A

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.592
MULTI PRONGED APPROACH.

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:31.361
STATEWIDE TO EFFECTIVELY TARGET

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:33.262
THE FINAL CRISIS AND SO BECAUSE

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:35.198
OF THAT WE THINK THE PROPOSED

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:36.065
FUNDING DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:38.167
NECESSARY BEFORE THAT

01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:39.602
COLLABORATION TAKES PLACE. THANK

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:43.306

YOU THINK THIS IS NECESSARY AND

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.785
NOT DUPLICATIVE. I THANK YOU

TO SPEAK TO THE DIFFERENCES.

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:04.627
BETWEEN THE PROPOSED FEDERAL

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:06.763
ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM AND OTHER

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:11.034
EXISTING EFFORTS. GOOD

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:13.269
AFTERNOON. SO I'LL TOUCH ON THE

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:15.705
FIRST PART ABOUT USING EXISTING

01:01:15.772 --> 01:01:18.941
RESOURCES. SO DO YOU GUYS HAVE A

01:01:19.008 --> 01:01:20.843
TASK FORCE PROGRAM THAT HAS

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:24.147
BEEN- SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AT

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:26.182
ONE TIME WE HAD FIFTY NINE- TASK

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:28.251
FORCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WERE

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:31.621
DOWN TO ABOUT SEVEN NOW- AND

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:35.224
THEY ARE VERY- GEOGRAPHICALLY

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:39.562
COMMUNITY BASED AND FOCUSED- SO

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:41.898
THE DIFFERENCE IS- AND I CAN

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:43.699
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE I. WHEN I

01:01:43.766 --> 01:01:46.035
CAME TO DOJ I WORKED FOR A STATE

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:48.004

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:53.643
THEY HAD OFFICERS FROM FROM ALL

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:54.844
THE LOCAL DEPARTMENTS. DURING

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:56.279
THAT TIME- WE CONDUCT

01:01:56.345 --> 01:01:58.114
INVESTIGATIONS THAT WERE

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:00.716
DICTATED THROUGH- WHAT THE NEEDS

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:03.553
OF THE AREA WORK. OUT WHEN WE

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:06.289
GET- INVESTIGATIONS AND CAME

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:08.224
ACROSS A BIG MULTI STATE

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:10.193
INVESTIGATIONS WE'RE ABLE TO

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:11.861
CALL THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

AT IT FROM A STATE AND- FEDERAL

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:39.622

RESOURCES WILL BE A PARTNER- AND

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:21.357
THIS WILL BE A MORE OF A

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:24.660
HOLISTIC APPROACH- BUT- DOJ'S

01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:27.863

01:04:43.679 --> 01:04:46.849
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU YOU'VE

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:48.150
- REALLY FIGURED OUT HOW THAT

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:50.119
WILL HAPPEN THIS SOUNDS MORE

01:04:50.186 --> 01:04:51.854
LIKE A PUNISHMENT AND

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:55.258
ENFORCEMENT ARM NOT NECESSARILY

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:56.559
LOOKING AT THE HEALTH

01:04:56.626 --> 01:04:58.828

HOW THAT WILL WORK AND HOW WE

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:13.142
GET PEOPLE TO- TO THE TO THE

01:05:13.209 --> 01:05:15.811

DON'T GET THAT SENSE HERE. WITH

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.082
THIS PROGRAM THAT THE TASK FORCE

ONLY GOING TO ONE END OF IT. THE

01:05:45.141 --> 01:05:51.180
WHO'S GOING TO DO THE OTHER AND. YEAH GREAT QUESTION AND I

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:53.949
THINK THE FUTURE IS A COMPONENT

01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:58.688
OF THAT AND- SO WE ARE STATEWIDE

01:05:58.754 --> 01:06:01.490
ORGANIZATION SO WILL BE HANDLING

01:06:01.557 --> 01:06:03.793
THINGS AT A STATE LEVEL WORKING

WORST. AND NOT ADDRESSING THE

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:25.815
USERS AFFECTED ALL BUT THE

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:30.453
OFFEND ALL WE KNOW THAT- PANELS

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:32.188
GETTING PUSHED INTO CALIFORNIA

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:34.623

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:53.576
DON'T OFFEND ALL THAT'S COMING

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:56.379
IN AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S A

01:06:56.445 --> 01:06:57.246
PASSED DOWN THROUGH A STATEWIDE

01:06:57.313 --> 01:07:00.049
EFFORT- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:02.451

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:42.171
UNFORESEEN- PROBLEMS. OR ISSUES

01:10:42.237 --> 01:10:44.073
OR THINGS WE NEED TO DO MORE

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:47.343
THAN WE THOUGHT WE WOULD NEED-

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:48.611
I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT ONE POINT

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:50.913
FIVE MILLION IS ENOUGH. ALSO

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.548
THAT WE CAN COMPLETE THE TASK

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:55.184
FORCE MISSION WHICH IS FROM A

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:58.153
VERY SHORT TIME LINE. IN AND SO-

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:01.223
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT D. O. J.

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:03.759
WHICH I THINK I MEAN I'D ONCE

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:05.127
BEFORE DEAL J. BUT I THINK WE'VE

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:07.730
BEEN. ENCROACHED ON THEIR BUDGET

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:10.099
QUITE A BIT WE'VE ASKED THEM TO

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:12.701
DO A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN WHAT WE

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:14.637
HAD ORIGINALLY ASKED HIM TO DO.

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:17.106
AND SO- I JUST NEED TO KNOW IF

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:18.240
THIS IS ENOUGH WHAT THE

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:20.175
DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO COMPLETE THE

01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:23.445
WORK OF THE TASK FORCE. BECAUSE-

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:25.481
IT'S REALLY HARD. FOR ME OR

01:11:25.547 --> 01:11:28.217
ANYONE ELSE- SPECIALIST BRADFORD

01:11:28.283 --> 01:11:30.853
AND I TO COME BACK- TO TRY TO

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:33.956
GET MORE FUNDING. WHEN THE

01:11:34.023 --> 01:11:37.459
REPORT IS DUE NEXT YEAR. AND SO-

01:11:37.526 --> 01:11:40.629
I THINK THE- DOJ NEEDS ALL THE

01:11:40.696 --> 01:11:42.164
MONEY THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:44.733
TO GET THIS DONE NOW. AND THAT

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.535
WE JUST DON'T. GIVE THEM A

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:48.203
LITTLE BIT RIGHT NOW AND HOPE

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:50.172
THAT THE- COMPLETED WE GIVE THEM

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:52.541
MORE THAN ENOUGH SO THAT HE CAN

01:11:52.608 --> 01:11:54.076
COMPLETE THE WORK OF THE TASK

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:57.146
FORCE- REPARATIONS IS RIGHT NOW.

01:11:57.212 --> 01:11:58.580
WE'RE UNDER A MICROSCOPE

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:00.916
CALIFORNIA IS AND IF WE DON'T

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.418
GET THIS RIGHT. YOU COULD HAVE

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:04.453
RAMIFICATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.622
SO IT'S REALLY IMPERATIVE THAT

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:08.624
WE SPEND SOME MONEY IN GAS THEY

01:12:08.691 --> 01:12:10.826
WOULD ALL HAVE ANY MONEY- RIGHT

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:12.895
NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS GETS

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:15.731
DONE RIGHT. AND SO I. I IMPLORED

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.633
THE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYER THE

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.701
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FINANCE

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:22.271
EVERYONE TO REALLY STEP UP THE

01:12:22.337 --> 01:12:24.940
GAME. AND GIVE MORE. MORE THAN

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:27.276
WHAT THEY MAY THINK THEY NEED-

01:12:27.342 --> 01:12:28.911
THAT WE REALLY GO THROUGH AND

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:31.213
MAKE SURE THEY GET ENOUGH OF THE

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.816
OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO PUT

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:35.250
IN YOU PUT INTO A THOUSAND FOR

01:12:35.317 --> 01:12:37.486
EXAMPLE FOR MEETINGS. A PART OF

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:38.554
THAT IS BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.289
MEETINGS NOW WHENPEOPLE WORK.

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:41.423

FOR ANY WORKING FAMILY IS SO-

01:13:00.609 --> 01:13:02.177
IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE START

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:04.012
EXPANDING WHAT WE THINK IS

01:13:04.079 --> 01:13:06.014

01:13:10.352 --> 01:13:12.588
DON'T KNOW IF THE DOJ WOULD LIKE

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:15.324
TO COMMENT BECAUSE I- EVERY DAY

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:17.226
WE WOULD KEEP ASKING FOR MORE

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:19.628
AND MORE THINGS FOR THEM TO DO-

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:21.463
THEY TRY. NOT DEEPLY PULLING

01:20:29.691 --> 01:20:30.825
THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:32.494

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:44.639
O'NEILL AT THE LEGISLATIVE

01:20:44.706 --> 01:20:46.875
ANALYST'S OFFICE. THERE ARE

01:20:46.942 --> 01:20:48.410
SERIOUS CONCERNS REGARDING

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:49.778
MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS

01:20:49.844 --> 01:20:51.913
PEOPLE SO WE DON'T RAISE A

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:53.248
CONCERN WITH THE GENERAL CONCEPT

01:20:53.315 --> 01:20:55.951
OF PUTTING RESOURCES TOWARD THAT

01:20:56.017 --> 01:20:58.153
PROBLEM- HOWEVER THE PARTICULAR

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:00.288
STRUCTURE OF THIS PROPOSAL DOES

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:02.123
RAISE SOME KEY QUESTIONS FOR THE

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:05.460
LEGISLATURE. AT THE FIRST IS THE

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:08.830
FOUR MILLION- PROPOSED FOUR

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:09.998
MILLION OVER PER YEAR OVER THREE

01:21:10.065 --> 01:21:11.600
YEARS. RED AMOUNT TO ADDRESS THE

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:13.134
PROBLEM AND WE ASK THAT BECAUSE

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:14.603
THE ADMINISTRATION WASN'T ABLE

01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:16.972
TO PROVIDE A CLEAR RATIONALE FOR

01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:20.008
THAT AMOUNT- SECOND IS B. S. C.

01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:21.876
C. THE BEST ENTITY TO ADMINISTER

01:21:21.943 --> 01:21:24.346
THESE GRANTS. AND WE NOTE THAT

01:21:24.412 --> 01:21:26.081
DOJ HAS AN OFFICE OF NATIVE

01:21:26.147 --> 01:21:28.416
AMERICAN AFFAIRS. AND WILD GRANT

01:21:28.483 --> 01:21:30.719
MAKING IS NOT OF COURSE DOJ'S

01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:32.554
BREAD AND BUTTER IT DOJ DOES

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:35.023
HAVE SOME GRANT MAKING IT IS IT

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:36.224
HAS SOME INVOLVEMENT WITH GRANT

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:38.126
MAKING PARTICULARLY IN THAT. IN

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:41.096
WITH RESPECT TO TRIBAL ISSUES-

01:21:41.162 --> 01:21:42.230
AND THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:44.399
BUDGET ACT INCLUDED FIVE MILLION

01:21:44.466 --> 01:21:45.967
FOR DOJ TO SUPPORT PUBLIC SAFETY

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:48.270
ON TRIBAL LANDS IN CALIFORNIA

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:50.472
INCLUDING BY STUDYING DE UM

01:21:50.538 --> 01:21:52.040
CHALLENGES RELATED TO REPORTING

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:54.376
AND IDENTIFICATION OF MISSING

01:21:54.442 --> 01:21:55.510
AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:57.712
SO COULD BE SOMETHING FOR THE

01:21:57.779 --> 01:21:58.346
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AS TO

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:00.148
WHETHER GIVEN ITS EXISTING- AND

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:03.251
EXPERTISE AND THIS RECENT-

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:05.320
INVESTMENT IN BUILDING DOJ'S

01:22:05.387 --> 01:22:07.422
EXPERTISE ON THIS ISSUE. WHETHER

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:09.324
DOJ WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE AS

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:12.227
THAT- ENTITY TO HOST THIS ADAM

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:15.597
GRANT PROGRAM- AND THIRD TO THE

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:16.865
EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES

01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:18.566
THIS FUNDING WE RECOMMEND THAT

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:21.002
IT REQUIRE REPORTING ON HOW THE

01:22:21.069 --> 01:22:23.838
MONEY IS USED AND WHAT OUTCOMES

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:28.576
ARE ULTIMATELY ACHIEVED. AT

THANK YOU THIS AREA AND INTENDED

INDIGENOUS WOMEN IS A PRIORITY

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:35.750
FOR BOTH THE NATIVE AMERICAN

01:22:35.817 --> 01:22:37.118
CAUCUS AND THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS.

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:38.953
WE'VE BEEN HIGHLIGHTING THIS FOR

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:42.624
THE LAST FEW YEARS TOGETHER AND

01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:43.892

PRESIDENT SURPLUS FOR INVESTING.

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:51.599
PROPERLY AND NOT. AND NOT UNDER

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:52.967
INVESTING IN THESE PROGRAMS THAT

01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:54.469
NOW THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:22:54.536 --> 01:22:56.504
AND SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO HOW YOU

01:22:56.571 --> 01:22:58.273
CAME UP WITH THIS DOLLAR AMOUNT

01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:00.141
AND THEN I HAVE A SECOND PART OF

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:13.922
PLANNING PROCESS BUT ALSO

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:17.625
ENSURING THAT MOST OF ALL TRIBES

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:18.760
ARE AWARE OF THIS FUNDING

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:22.230

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:37.612
THREE YEARS WE FOUND THAT. TO

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:41.583
BE- THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION-

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:42.984
AND IN TERMS OF THE

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:47.355
INCORPORATION OF THE- TRIBES I

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:50.892
WOULD- HAVE TO DEFER TO THE- FAA

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:53.328
WOULD- INCORPORATE THOSE MEMBERS

01:23:53.395 --> 01:24:01.569
AS THEY DEVELOP THAT PROGRAM.

01:24:01.636 --> 01:24:02.904
WHAT I ACTUALLY STRONGLY

01:24:02.971 --> 01:24:04.005
ENCOURAGE THAT WHATEVER THIS

01:24:04.072 --> 01:24:06.674
MONEY AND SO THAT THE WORK WILL

01:24:06.741 --> 01:24:08.243
BE HAND IN HAND WITH OUR TRAVEL

LEADERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS

01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:12.580
AND STAKEHOLDERS. OUT THERE SO

01:24:12.647 --> 01:24:15.083
THAT WE'RE NOT PERPETUATING A

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:17.619
SITUATION WHEN AND WHERE. WORDS

01:24:17.685 --> 01:24:19.053

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.523
THE CHANGES THAT THEY NEED TO BE

01:24:21.589 --> 01:24:22.357
I THINK WE HAVE A HISTORY OF

01:24:22.424 --> 01:24:24.025
TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED

01:24:24.092 --> 01:24:25.160
AND HOW THEY NEEDED AND- NOT

SOLUTIONS OUT THERE- AND ALSO.

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:39.240
WHILE A MULTI YEAR APPROACH

01:24:39.307 --> 01:24:40.642
MAKES SENSE A LITTLE MORE

01:24:40.708 --> 01:24:42.043
INFORMATION OF WHETHER OR NOT

HOWEVER WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

01:49:36.569 --> 01:49:38.004

THE INCREASING CAPITAL OUTLAY

01:53:17.557 --> 01:53:20.693
FUNDING WILL NOT FUND PRISONS

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:21.961
LIKELY TO CLOSE IN THE NEXT FIVE

01:53:22.028 --> 01:53:26.332
YEARS. AT THIS TIME THAT THE

01:53:26.399 --> 01:53:28.601
PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE THE

01:53:28.668 --> 01:53:30.904
LEGISLATURE- FOR CONSIDERATION

01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:32.172
REPRESENT THE MOST CRITICAL

01:53:32.238 --> 01:53:34.207
PROJECTS- THAT NEED TO ENSURE

01:53:34.274 --> 01:53:37.243

01:53:43.116 --> 01:53:45.418
BE THE CASE BUT AGAIN AS MISTER

01:53:45.485 --> 01:53:47.120
LOZANO STATED WHEN WE CAN TAKE

01:53:47.187 --> 01:53:47.620
INTO CONSIDERATION WHICH

01:53:47.687 --> 01:53:48.321
PRESENTS TO CLOSE RECENT

01:53:48.388 --> 01:53:50.657
FACILITY INVESTMENTS WILL BE

01:53:50.723 --> 01:53:52.358
INCLUDED IN THAT ASSESSMENT.

01:53:52.425 --> 01:54:00.433
OKAY. MISTER JOHN FIRE I JUST

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.902
HAVE ONE QUESTION WITH A

01:54:02.969 --> 01:54:04.404
QUESTION WE KEEP GOING OVER AND

01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:06.472
OVER AGAIN A LOT OF TIMES WE

01:54:06.539 --> 01:54:08.107
DON'T GET THE ANSWER PROBABLY

01:54:08.174 --> 01:54:09.676
MOST OF THE TIME. THE QUESTION

01:54:09.742 --> 01:54:13.479
IS WHEN WILL CDCR LET US KNOW

01:54:13.546 --> 01:54:17.317
WHICH FACILITIES WE CAN CLOSE. I

01:54:17.383 --> 01:54:20.453
KNOW THIS IS A- SEEM TO BE

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:22.989
DIFFICULT BUT THERE HAS TO BE

01:54:23.056 --> 01:54:24.524
SOME KIND ANALYSIS DONE BECAUSE

01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:26.726
I THINK THE LAWSUIT THAT IS KIND

01:54:26.793 --> 01:54:29.395
OF STYMIED US FROM CLOSING DOWN

01:54:29.462 --> 01:54:31.531
IS BECAUSE PART OF THAT I THINK

01:54:31.598 --> 01:54:33.233
PART RATIONALE AS WE HAD DONE

01:54:33.299 --> 01:54:35.802
OUR DUE DILIGENCE IN ENSURING

01:54:35.868 --> 01:54:38.104
THAT THE PUBLIC IS SAFE AND THAT

01:54:38.171 --> 01:54:40.373
WOULD THAT THE FACILITIES ARE

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:43.076
THE ONES THAT ARE BEST. AT

01:54:43.142 --> 01:54:46.713
CLOSING. SO CAN WE GET AN IDEA

01:54:46.779 --> 01:54:49.182
OF WHEN YOU WILL GET BACK TO US.

01:54:49.249 --> 01:54:52.452

01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:03.463
HOWEVER- THEY I THINK OF

01:55:03.529 --> 01:55:05.164
SOMETHING THAT WE PROBABLY THAT

01:55:05.231 --> 01:55:06.933
THIS DEPARTMENT IS KIND OF

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.269
PAINTING ANYWAY AS WE ARE TRYING

01:55:09.335 --> 01:55:10.937
TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AND OPEN AS

01:55:11.004 --> 01:55:12.305
POSSIBLE AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING

01:55:12.372 --> 01:55:12.939
THOSE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:15.074
LEGISLATURE AND THE STAFF TO

01:55:15.141 --> 01:55:16.042
KEEP THOSE LINES OF

01:55:16.109 --> 01:55:17.644
COMMUNICATION OPEN WHEN

01:55:17.710 --> 01:55:19.045
DISCUSSING THIS VERY SENSITIVE

01:55:19.112 --> 01:55:21.614
TOPIC SO AGAIN AN ADDITIONAL

01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:23.616
TUNNEL STATED WHEN WE WILL BE

01:55:23.683 --> 01:55:25.351
LOOKING AT THE THREE POTENTIALLY

01:55:25.418 --> 01:55:27.120
THREE PRESENT THAT WE CAN CLOSE

01:55:27.186 --> 01:55:28.254
AND WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THE

01:55:28.321 --> 01:55:29.455
CRITERIA OUTLINED IN THE PENAL

01:55:29.522 --> 01:55:31.157
CODE. AND SO WE WILL NEED TO DO

01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:33.059
THAT ASSESSMENT AND LOOK AT ALL

01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:34.761
THE FACTORS THAT HE'S HAD STATED

01:55:34.827 --> 01:55:36.663
SUCH AS- YOU KNOW HOUSING NEEDS

01:55:36.729 --> 01:55:38.164
THAT TYPE THE POPULAR BUT NEEDS

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:40.133
OF THE POPULATION RECENT-

01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:41.501
FACILITY INVESTMENTS THOSE TYPES

01:55:41.567 --> 01:55:43.303
OF THINGS SO THAT'S NOT A

01:55:43.369 --> 01:55:45.805
PROCESS THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN

01:55:45.872 --> 01:55:46.439
IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS

01:55:46.506 --> 01:55:48.908
ADDITIONALLY AS WE ALL KNOW WE

01:55:48.975 --> 01:55:51.444
ARE STILL IN LITIGATION OVER THE

01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:53.246
CLOSURE OF CCC AND I CAN. TELL

YOU WHEN THAT LITIGATION WILL BE

01:55:54.614 --> 01:55:55.815
COMPLETED AND WHAT THE OUTCOME

01:55:55.882 --> 01:55:57.850
WILL BE SO WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT

01:55:57.917 --> 01:55:59.585
INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN WE ARE

01:55:59.652 --> 01:56:02.221
DEVELOPING OUR POTENTIAL- LIST

01:56:02.288 --> 01:56:03.356
OF PRISONS THAT COULD BE CLOSE

01:56:03.423 --> 01:56:06.059
SO I WILL CMMIT TO YOU I THINK

01:56:06.125 --> 01:56:08.661
THE SECRETARY HAS ALSO COMMITTED

01:56:08.728 --> 01:56:10.296

01:56:13.433 --> 01:56:16.202
SENSITIVE TOPIC- BUT AS SOON AS

01:56:16.269 --> 01:56:19.005

01:56:19.072 --> 01:56:19.839
ANNOUNCE. WHICH PRINTABLE CLOSE

01:56:19.906 --> 01:56:21.107

NOT GOING TO BE ALL THREE BY X.

01:56:23.376 --> 01:56:25.345

IMPLEMENT THERE'S A LOT OF LABOR

01:56:28.047 --> 01:56:29.382
THINGS AT LOGISTICS THAT NEED TO

01:56:29.449 --> 01:56:31.351
BE WORKED OUT SO I REALLY THIS

01:56:31.417 --> 01:56:33.553
IS KIND OF A LONG ANSWER BUT I

01:56:33.619 --> 01:56:35.288

. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS TOPIC

01:57:40.653 --> 01:57:42.688
AND SO WE HAVE GOT INTO NEW

01:57:42.755 --> 01:57:44.257
PIECES OF INFORMATION THAT THERE

01:57:44.323 --> 01:57:47.293
WILL BE THREE ADDITIONAL BY

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:49.028
TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND THAT

01:57:49.095 --> 01:57:50.196
AT LEAST A YEAR AHEAD OF TIME

01:57:50.263 --> 01:57:51.831
WILL NOW WITH THOSE THREE ARE

01:57:51.898 --> 01:57:53.666

CREDIT FOR THE TWO. ADDITIONAL

01:57:56.068 --> 01:57:56.903
PIECES OF INFORMATION YOU'VE

01:57:56.969 --> 01:57:59.572

01:57:59.639 --> 01:58:01.574
FRUSTRATED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE-

01:58:01.641 --> 01:58:03.676
WE WANT TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT

PART OF THOSE PERSONS THAT COULD

01:58:10.683 --> 01:58:12.552
POTENTIALLY BE. CLOSE AND SO WE

01:58:12.618 --> 01:58:14.353
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:16.522
GIVEN THAT. PASSED AND GIVEN THE

01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:19.425
LACK OF INFORMATION. WHEN THE

01:58:19.492 --> 01:58:20.893
TWO THINGS I MENTIONED THERE AT

IT IS TROUBLING AS OUR DUTY HERE

01:58:32.238 --> 01:58:33.773
IN THE LEGISLATURE IS TO ENSURE

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.141
THAT OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING

PROTECTED AND- IMPROPERLY. USE

01:58:37.376 --> 01:58:40.480
THAT OUT THERE. AND SELL ASKS.

01:58:40.546 --> 01:58:41.881
THIS PROCESS QUICKLY MOVES

01:58:41.948 --> 01:58:43.049
BEFORE THE YEAR'S OVER I HOPE

01:58:43.115 --> 01:58:45.852

TO AN END- AND I WOULD LIKE THIS

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:56.195
ALSO START THINKING BEYOND

01:58:56.262 --> 01:58:57.530
TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE IF THESE

01:58:57.597 --> 01:58:58.731
PROJECTIONS ARE. REAL THERE

HAPPENING IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND

01:59:01.901 --> 01:59:03.102
AGAIN DOLLARS THAT WE COULD

01:59:03.169 --> 01:59:04.904
POSSIBLY BE INVEST IN THAT WILL

01:59:04.971 --> 01:59:06.706
BE FOR NOT COME TWENTY SIX. OUT

SO WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND

01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:26.192
MOVE ON TO THE SECOND ITEM WHICH

01:59:26.259 --> 01:59:27.493
IS OUR HEALTH CARE FACILITY

ABOUT ONE ONE BILLION TO ONE

02:03:05.111 --> 02:03:06.345
POINT FIVE BILLION SOME OF THE

02:03:06.412 --> 02:03:08.447
INCREASES ARE DUE TO FACTORS

02:03:08.514 --> 02:03:09.415
THAT ARE NOT WITHIN THE

EXCEED WHAT IS TYPICALLY SEEN IN

02:03:19.625 --> 02:03:22.194
OTHER DEPARTMENTS. I'M AND THEN

02:03:22.261 --> 02:03:24.130
WE ALSO NOTE THAT OTHER CITIES

02:03:31.937 --> 02:03:38.677
TO THESE COSTS SIX. ESCALATIONS. THIS IS EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC

02:03:38.744 --> 02:03:39.145
AND HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC

02:03:39.211 --> 02:03:42.848

ESCALATIONS ARE MINIMIZED. THIS

02:03:57.630 --> 02:03:58.697
COULD INCLUDE REQUESTING AN

02:03:58.764 --> 02:04:00.833
AUDIT OF CTCS PROJECT PLANNING

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SUPPORTS

02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:17.616
THE INCREASE OF SIXTY SEVEN

CDC ARE TO COME TO THIS FIGURE

02:04:25.357 --> 02:04:27.593
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. THE COST

02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:29.261
INCREASES OF THE PROGRAM IN THE

ON STARTED- THE COST INCREASES

02:04:35.201 --> 02:04:36.902
ARE UNFORTUNATE. BUT THE

CONSTRUCTION OF THESE FACILITIES

02:04:38.537 --> 02:04:40.172

02:04:40.239 --> 02:04:42.308
PLOT A COURT ORDER AND WE'RE

02:04:42.374 --> 02:04:44.343
HOPEFUL AS YOU ARE I'M SURE THAT

02:04:44.410 --> 02:04:46.145
THIS ALLOCATION WILL PROVIDE

02:04:46.212 --> 02:04:48.814
ENOUGH FUNDING. TO COMPLETE THE

02:04:48.881 --> 02:04:56.355
PROGRAM. BUT FELT CAN- DOES HAVE

02:04:56.422 --> 02:04:58.257
A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE FACT

02:04:58.324 --> 02:05:00.426
THAT LAST YEAR I WAS TOLD THAT

02:05:00.492 --> 02:05:02.127
THE SIXTY SEVEN MILLION WITH

02:05:02.194 --> 02:05:04.063
MAYBE ALL THEY WERE IN NEED AND

02:05:04.129 --> 02:05:06.232
WE'RE ALMOST DONE AND WE'RE BACK

02:05:06.298 --> 02:05:10.569
HERE TO DAY- ASKING FOR ANOTHER.

02:05:10.636 --> 02:05:11.103
SIXTY SEVEN EIGHT MILLION

02:05:11.170 --> 02:05:13.672
DOLLARS AND I GUESS JUST LONG

02:05:13.739 --> 02:05:16.175
TERM CONCERNS ABOUT. HOW WERE

02:05:16.242 --> 02:05:17.476
COMING UP WITH THESE PROJECTIONS

02:05:17.543 --> 02:05:19.245
AND HOWEVER MANAGING PROJECTS

02:05:19.311 --> 02:05:22.147
SPECIALLY SENSE WE HAVE AFTER

02:05:22.214 --> 02:05:24.316
THIS PART IS THAT WE HAVE MORE.

02:05:24.383 --> 02:05:26.185
MORE UP MORE PROJECTS COMING ON

02:05:26.252 --> 02:05:28.254
BOARD TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT. ONE

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:30.890
POINT EIGHT. BILLION DOLLARS AND

02:05:30.956 --> 02:05:33.225
JUST TO DO THE MATH FOR YOU IF I

02:05:33.292 --> 02:05:34.960
FOLLOW THE PATTERN OF FALLING OF

02:05:35.027 --> 02:05:38.163
A 50% INCREASE THAT ONE POINT IN

02:05:38.230 --> 02:05:39.431
IS GOING TO TURN TO TWO POINT

02:05:39.498 --> 02:05:41.300
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S

02:05:41.367 --> 02:05:42.334
ALMOST AN EXTRA BILLION DOLLARS.

02:05:42.401 --> 02:05:44.403
STATE THAT YOU ARE. THAT WE

02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:45.571
COULD POSSIBLY BE UNDER

02:05:45.638 --> 02:05:47.106
ESTIMATING AND SO WHAT KIND OF

02:05:47.172 --> 02:05:48.974
SECURITY SO WHAT KIND OF

02:05:49.041 --> 02:05:50.309
ASSURANCES THAT WE HAVE THAT WE

02:05:50.376 --> 02:05:51.977
HAVE A BETTER SYSTEM NOW FOR

02:05:52.044 --> 02:05:53.145
PROJECTIONS AND A BETTER SYSTEM

02:05:53.212 --> 02:05:54.446
NOW FOR MANAGEMENT OF THESE

02:05:54.513 --> 02:05:55.414
PROJECTS SO THAT WE'RE NOT

02:05:55.481 --> 02:05:57.082
SHORT. ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS

02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:59.551

02:05:59.618 --> 02:06:04.123
HAVE COMING ONLINE- THANK YOU

02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:05.891

02:06:05.958 --> 02:06:07.860
MENTIONED BEFORE. THERE HAVE

02:06:07.927 --> 02:06:09.561
BEEN LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE

02:06:09.628 --> 02:06:14.133
HICCUP- PROJECTS- PICKED UP WITH

02:06:14.199 --> 02:06:17.903

INSTITUTIONS STATEWIDE

02:06:23.208 --> 02:06:25.277
SIMULTANEOUSLY. IT STRAINED OUR

02:06:25.344 --> 02:06:27.413
RESOURCES AND IN THE INCEPTION

02:06:27.479 --> 02:06:29.615
OF THE PROGRAM THERE WERE. A

02:06:29.682 --> 02:06:31.250
SHORT CUTS. TAKEN IN THE

02:06:31.317 --> 02:06:34.253
PLANNING THAT TURNED OUT TO. NOT

BE SHORTCUTS- A- YOU KNOW SO AS

02:06:40.092 --> 02:06:43.696
AS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER- WE

02:06:43.762 --> 02:06:48.734
HAVE- TAKEN STEPS TO- IMPROVE

02:06:48.801 --> 02:06:51.003
THE OUTGOING ADMINISTRATION OF

02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:53.906
THE REMAINING. WORK AND WE HAVE

02:06:53.973 --> 02:06:55.841
ALSO TAKEN STEPS TO IMPROVE THE

02:06:55.908 --> 02:06:58.811
PLANNING OF PROJECTS GOING

02:06:58.877 --> 02:07:02.047
FORWARD. BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU

02:07:02.114 --> 02:07:03.248
TOLD US LAST YEAR AND THEN

02:07:03.315 --> 02:07:05.050

WHAT THOSE LESSONS LEARNED ARE

02:07:08.253 --> 02:07:09.989
AND HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WERE

02:07:10.055 --> 02:07:11.357
DONE. LEARNING LESSONS WHEN THIS

02:07:11.423 --> 02:07:13.125
HAS BEEN GOOD THIS I'VE ONLY

02:07:13.192 --> 02:07:14.793
BEEN HERE FOR TWO YEARS BUT A

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:16.895
HECK THAT HAS BEEN ATTENDING A

02:07:27.973 --> 02:07:31.477
THE RISKS IN DOING AT THAT LEVEL

02:07:31.543 --> 02:07:34.380
OF RENOVATION WORK THAT- WHAT'S

02:07:34.446 --> 02:07:35.581

HAVE DONE OUR BEST TO- IDENTIFY

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:51.797
WHAT. WE THINK IS NECESSARY- AT

02:07:51.864 --> 02:07:54.867
THIS POINT IN TIME TO A FINISHED

02:07:54.933 --> 02:07:58.303
PROGRAM AT THAT SAID- THERE ARE

02:07:58.370 --> 02:08:01.774
SEVERAL- PHASES OF WORK LEFT-

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:05.677
PRESENTS- OUR TIMELINE RISKS AND

02:08:05.744 --> 02:08:07.746
TIMELINE WRISTS TRANSLATES TO

02:08:07.813 --> 02:08:11.450
MONEY- SO WE'RE WE'RE HOPEFUL

02:08:11.517 --> 02:08:13.719

AS EFFICIENTLY. AS POSSIBLE- AND

02:08:27.332 --> 02:08:29.601
THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE PROMISE

02:08:29.668 --> 02:08:31.236
AT THAT BUT I CAN MAKE YOUR

02:08:31.303 --> 02:08:33.205
REGARDING FUNDING FOR HECTOR. AS

02:08:33.272 --> 02:08:35.541
FAR AS PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD-

02:08:35.607 --> 02:08:38.677
IN IN FUTURE- AS I ALSO

02:08:38.744 --> 02:08:42.448
MENTIONED EARLIER- WE HAVE-

02:08:42.514 --> 02:08:46.018
ENHANCED ARE REQUIREMENTS OF THE

02:08:46.085 --> 02:08:48.520
EARLY PLANNING FOR PROJECTS SO

02:08:48.587 --> 02:08:51.490
THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUES THAT WERE

02:08:51.557 --> 02:08:56.562
OVERLOOKED AND A HICCUP SUCH AS-

02:08:56.628 --> 02:08:58.664
EVALUATION OF EXISTING UTILITY

02:08:58.730 --> 02:09:02.301
AND INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS- AND-

02:09:02.367 --> 02:09:04.369
FIELD VERIFICATION OF SUPPORTING

02:09:04.436 --> 02:09:05.938
INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS.

02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:08.574

LEARNING AND WE ARE DOING BETTER

02:10:15.507 --> 02:10:19.978
BECAUSE THESE ARE REAL DOLLARS.

02:10:20.045 --> 02:10:21.647
I OFTENTIMES INTO THE BILLION

02:10:21.713 --> 02:10:23.081
DOLLARS THAT COULD BE USED FOR

02:10:39.364 --> 02:10:41.166
TO SEE THESE OCCURRENCES UP

02:10:41.233 --> 02:10:44.036

BE COLLECTED OF WHICH- OR WHICH

02:11:39.925 --> 02:11:42.060

AND THE AND THE PARTS AS WELL.

02:12:22.367 --> 02:12:24.002
AND THAT IS ONE COMPONENT THAT

02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:25.170
WOULD BE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF

AN OFFENDER DATA POINTS AND SO

02:12:38.016 --> 02:12:39.985
THE IDEA IS THAT WE WILL- LOOK

02:12:40.052 --> 02:12:41.820
AT SOME OF THAT INFORMATION THAT

02:12:41.887 --> 02:12:43.922
WE ALREADY COLLECT AND FIGURE

OUT- USING BEST PRACTICES. I GET

02:12:45.991 --> 02:12:48.393

REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND SO

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:05.577
I. THIS FUNDING WILL BE USED TO

02:13:05.644 --> 02:13:07.713
KIND OF EXPLORE OPTIONS THAT THE

02:13:07.779 --> 02:13:09.648

PROPOSAL THAT TOTAL- ABOUT SIXTY

02:26:27.178 --> 02:26:29.213
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS ONE

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:30.882
OF THEM- THERE IS ALSO A FIFTEEN

02:26:30.948 --> 02:26:32.283
MILLION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:26:34.585 --> 02:26:35.486

02:26:35.553 --> 02:26:36.954
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

02:26:37.021 --> 02:26:38.589
DEPARTMENT OF AGING FOR THAT

02:26:38.656 --> 02:26:41.692
CARE COURT SUPPORTER PROGRAM-

02:26:41.759 --> 02:26:45.029
WHICH COMPLEMENTS THIS PROPOSAL-

02:26:45.096 --> 02:26:47.298
SB THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT IS

02:26:47.365 --> 02:26:47.865
CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE

02:26:47.932 --> 02:26:50.535
POLICY PROCESS AND MAY CONTINUE

02:26:50.601 --> 02:26:52.403
TO CHANGE. AND SO THIS MEANS

02:26:52.470 --> 02:26:54.038
THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING

02:26:54.105 --> 02:26:55.106
NEEDED AT THE STATE AND LOCAL

02:26:55.173 --> 02:26:57.041
LEVEL REALLY DEPENDS ON THE

02:26:57.108 --> 02:26:58.309
SPECIFIC PROCESSES AND

02:26:58.376 --> 02:27:00.311
PROCEDURES THAT ARE INCLUDED. IN

02:27:00.378 --> 02:27:03.447
THE FINAL LEGISLATION- WE WOULD

02:27:03.514 --> 02:27:04.148
ALSO NOTE THAT THE

02:27:04.215 --> 02:27:05.716
ADMINISTRATION HAS ACKNOWLEDGED

02:27:05.783 --> 02:27:07.885
THAT IT IS STILL WORKING WITH

02:27:07.952 --> 02:27:10.955
COUNTIES TO IDENTIFY COSTS AND

02:27:11.022 --> 02:27:11.923
IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY

02:27:11.989 --> 02:27:13.391
SIGNIFICANT. SO WITHOUT FULLY

02:27:13.457 --> 02:27:14.959
IDENTIFYING THE STATE AND LOCAL

02:27:15.026 --> 02:27:16.394
COST IT'SREALLY DIFFICULT FOR

02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:17.595
THE LEGISLATURE TO WAIVE THIS

02:27:17.662 --> 02:27:19.630
PROPOSAL AGAINST ALL OF ITS

02:27:19.697 --> 02:27:21.532
OTHER GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES.

02:27:21.599 --> 02:27:22.967
AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE DO

02:27:23.034 --> 02:27:23.968
THINK IT IS PREMATURE TO

02:27:24.035 --> 02:27:25.169
CONSIDER THE GOVERNOR'S MAIN

02:27:25.236 --> 02:27:27.638
PROVISION BUDGET PROPOSALS IN

02:27:27.705 --> 02:27:29.974
THIS AREA AT THIS TIME. WE DO

02:27:30.041 --> 02:27:32.310
RAISE THAT THE QUESTION ABOUT-

02:27:32.376 --> 02:27:34.278
YOU KNOW KEY DECISIONS AND

02:27:34.345 --> 02:27:36.347
SPECIFIC PROPHECIES- WE DID WANT

02:27:36.414 --> 02:27:38.683
TO OFFER SOME EXAMPLES- IN TERMS

02:27:38.749 --> 02:27:40.418
OF HOW THEY CAN IMPACT THE LEVEL

02:27:40.484 --> 02:27:42.019
OF RESOURCES AND WHERE THEY

02:27:42.086 --> 02:27:43.354
MIGHT BE NEEDED. AND THEY REALLY

02:27:43.421 --> 02:27:45.489
FALL INTO KIND OF FIVE KEY

02:27:45.556 --> 02:27:47.525
CATEGORIES ON THESE EXAMPLES.

02:27:47.592 --> 02:27:49.293
THE FIRST IS INTERACTIONS WITH

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:51.329
EXISTING PROGRAMS. SO HOW DO

02:27:51.395 --> 02:27:53.130
EXISTING STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAM

02:27:53.197 --> 02:27:55.199
PROPHECIES AND CAPACITY INTERACT

02:27:55.266 --> 02:27:56.801
WITH CARE COURT. SO FOR EXAMPLE

02:27:56.867 --> 02:27:58.236
WHEN THE MISDEMEANOR ICE TEAS

02:27:58.302 --> 02:27:59.470
COME OVER DOES THAT MEAN THAT

02:27:59.537 --> 02:28:01.906
THEY NEED TO BE. RESTORED TO

02:28:01.973 --> 02:28:03.708
COMPETENCY DO THE CARE COURT

02:28:03.774 --> 02:28:05.076
PARTICIPANTS- IN TERMS OF THEIR

02:28:05.142 --> 02:28:07.712
NEEDS- MIMIC THOSE THAT ARE

02:28:07.778 --> 02:28:09.814

NEEDS HELP HOW ARE YOU GOING TO.

02:34:07.605 --> 02:34:11.208
KNOW WHETHER THAT INDIVIDUAL. IS

SERVICES THAT MAYBE THIS IS JUST

02:34:15.879 --> 02:34:17.481
A FAMILY MEMBER LOOKING TO. SHED

02:34:17.548 --> 02:34:19.583
RESPONSIBILITY I'VE I'M NOT SURE

02:34:19.650 --> 02:34:21.385
THAT'S NOT HOW SELF HELP CENTERS

02:34:21.452 --> 02:34:24.388
WORK. WHAT WHAT LEVEL OF

02:34:24.455 --> 02:34:25.356
COUNSELING MENTAL HEALTH

02:34:25.422 --> 02:34:29.026
SERVICES. WHAT LEVEL OF SOCIAL

02:34:29.093 --> 02:34:30.694
SERVICES ARE GOING TO BE

02:34:30.761 --> 02:34:31.929
AVAILABLE TO THE SELF HELP

02:34:31.996 --> 02:34:36.433
CENTERS THAT. IT'S MY

02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:37.134
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WOULD

02:34:37.201 --> 02:34:39.303
LIKELY BE AB JUST PROVIDING

02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:41.538
RESOURCES AND INFORMATION I

02:34:41.605 --> 02:34:43.474
THINK AND AGAIN THIS HASN'T WE

02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:45.275
DON'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF

02:34:45.342 --> 02:34:47.311
MODELS TEND TO WORK OFF THAT

02:34:47.378 --> 02:34:48.879
LOOK AT SOME OTHER OUTPATIENT

02:34:48.946 --> 02:34:50.114
TREATMENT SIMILAR MODELS AND

02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:51.815
THINGS GOING ON IN OTHER STATES

02:34:51.882 --> 02:34:52.650
BUT THERE'S NOTHING PRECISELY

02:34:52.716 --> 02:34:55.352
LIKE THIS BUT WE BELIEVE THAT-

02:34:55.419 --> 02:34:57.021
WHAT A SELF HELP CENTERS RENTAL

02:34:57.087 --> 02:34:59.657
COULD BE IS PROVIDING RESOURCES

02:34:59.723 --> 02:35:02.693
TEMPORARY REFERRALS POSSIBLY I'M

02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:06.330
JUST MAKING THIS. UP WOULD BE

02:35:06.397 --> 02:35:10.000
HONEST. RESEARCH WHERE. TWO

02:35:10.067 --> 02:35:11.902
OTHER SOURCE AND DEPENDING ON

02:35:11.969 --> 02:35:13.704
WHAT THE PERSON'S NEEDS WOULD BE

02:35:13.771 --> 02:35:15.072
SO WHAT WHAT ABOUT TRAINING FOR

02:35:15.139 --> 02:35:16.240
THE PEOPLE ACT THE SELF HELP

02:35:16.306 --> 02:35:18.909
CENTERS TO UNDERSTAND- SORT OF

02:35:18.976 --> 02:35:23.013
WHERE THEY COULD POTENTIALLY

02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:24.715
THE SELF HELP CENTERS THAT

02:35:24.782 --> 02:35:25.282
TYPICALLY ARE DEALING WITH

02:35:25.349 --> 02:35:27.818
FAMILY LAW AND SORT OF MINOR

02:35:27.885 --> 02:35:30.054

02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:33.190
GOING TO BE TAKING ON. THIS

02:35:33.257 --> 02:35:37.995
BREATH. AND SPECULATE ON THAT-

02:35:38.062 --> 02:35:39.463
COMPLETELY BEFORE THE DETAILS

02:35:39.530 --> 02:35:41.498
ARE WORKED OUT BUT THAT IS ONE

02:35:41.565 --> 02:35:43.233
AREA THAT WE THINK SELF HELP

02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:45.402
CENTERS IS ONE AREA THAT WE

02:35:45.469 --> 02:35:47.071
THINK WE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION

. AGAIN THE DETAILS ARE NOT.

02:35:48.672 --> 02:35:52.009

EITHER DON'T EXISTING COUNTIES

02:40:18.041 --> 02:40:21.311
ARE SEVERELY. OVER TAXED AND

02:40:21.378 --> 02:40:23.046
THERE'S A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF

02:40:23.113 --> 02:40:24.781
SUPPORT AN EXPECTATION THAT'S

02:40:24.848 --> 02:40:27.617
BEING CREATED. COMING OUT OF

ADDITIONAL MONEY. BUT IT CAN'T

02:40:42.733 --> 02:40:44.835
BE SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT

02:40:44.901 --> 02:40:47.537
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE POTENTIAL

02:40:47.604 --> 02:40:49.639
OUTCOMES ARE THE RESULTS WHERE

02:40:49.706 --> 02:40:52.409
FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE. REFERRED

02:40:52.476 --> 02:40:55.612

02:40:55.679 --> 02:40:57.514
ULTIMATELY GING TO BE ABLE TO

02:40:57.581 --> 02:41:02.019
DO WITH THESE FOLKS AND- IF WHAT

02:41:02.085 --> 02:41:04.054
THIS IS ENDING UP BEING IS JUST

02:41:04.121 --> 02:41:06.823
A WAY OF CORRALLING. AND

02:41:06.890 --> 02:41:08.625
DETAINING FOLKS WHO ARE

02:41:08.692 --> 02:41:11.695
INCONVENIENT WHICH IS WHAT THIS

02:41:11.762 --> 02:41:13.296
LOOKS LIKE BEN. I DON'T

02:41:13.363 --> 02:41:15.932
UNDERSTAND AT ALL WHERE THIS

02:41:15.999 --> 02:41:17.067
PROPOSAL IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO

02:41:17.134 --> 02:41:20.270
BE. HELPFUL AND THE PEOPLE THAT

02:41:20.337 --> 02:41:21.738
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WHO ARE

02:41:21.805 --> 02:41:23.540
BEING THE SUBJECT OF ALL THESE

02:41:23.607 --> 02:41:26.276
HAVE RIGHTSAND INTO JUST ROLL

02:41:26.343 --> 02:41:28.345
OVER THAT FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF

02:41:28.412 --> 02:41:30.147
OTHERS WHO WANT TO COME IN AND

02:41:30.213 --> 02:41:32.315
REPORT THAT MORE. WORK CREATE

02:41:32.382 --> 02:41:35.052
OTHER AT ANOTHER SITUATION KIND

02:41:35.118 --> 02:41:37.721
OF FORCE THEM OFF IS. I DON'T

02:41:37.788 --> 02:41:39.489
THINK GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL

02:41:39.556 --> 02:41:41.324
HERE. AND THE FACT THAT WE I'M

02:41:41.391 --> 02:41:42.692
NOT SURE THAT WE'VE ADEQUATELY

02:41:42.759 --> 02:41:44.094
IDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS WE'RE

02:41:44.161 --> 02:41:45.796
TALKING ABOUT. THAT WE'VE

02:41:45.862 --> 02:41:49.566
IDENTIFIED WHAT THE SERVICES.

02:41:49.633 --> 02:41:51.501
EXPECTATIONS ARE GOING TO BE.

02:41:51.568 --> 02:41:53.503
WHAT THE HOUSING OBLIGATIONS ARE

02:41:53.570 --> 02:41:56.273
GOING TO BE WHAT ALL OF THIS

02:41:56.339 --> 02:41:59.209
FRAMEWORK REALLY ENDS UP. THE

02:41:59.276 --> 02:42:01.078
ONLY PLACE RIGHT NOW WHERE A LOT

02:42:01.144 --> 02:42:04.014
OF THESE FOLKS END UP IS. JAIL

02:42:04.081 --> 02:42:06.483
AND IF WE DON'T CREATE AN

02:42:06.550 --> 02:42:08.251
APPROPRIATE. BACKSTOP

02:42:08.318 --> 02:42:10.821
APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR FOLKS TO

02:42:10.887 --> 02:42:12.689
GO THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO

02:42:12.756 --> 02:42:15.258
END UP. AND THAT THAT'S

02:42:15.325 --> 02:42:17.561
EXPENSIVE AND IT'S DEBILITATING

02:42:17.627 --> 02:42:20.230
AND IT IS NOT AT ALL HELPFUL TO

02:42:20.297 --> 02:42:23.100
THOSE INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES IF

02:42:23.166 --> 02:42:24.468
THERE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO

02:42:24.534 --> 02:42:26.236
ARE. TRYING TO TRYING TO HELP

02:42:26.303 --> 02:42:28.772
THAT SUCH THOSE FOLKS OUTSIDE I

02:42:28.839 --> 02:42:29.773
KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT ONLY A

02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:32.109
PIECE OF IT. BUT I ACTUALLY

02:42:32.175 --> 02:42:33.510
SURPRISED IN THIS THE JUDICIAL

02:42:33.577 --> 02:42:34.878
COUNCIL'S NOT PUSHING BACK QUITE

02:42:34.945 --> 02:42:36.813
A BIT BECAUSE I DON'T SEE HOW

02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:40.050
UNDER THE EXISTING PROPOSAL.

02:42:40.117 --> 02:42:41.718
THERE'S ANY HOPE THAT THEY'RE

02:42:41.785 --> 02:42:42.486
THAT THEY'RE PART OF THIS

02:42:42.552 --> 02:42:45.322
PROCESS IS GOING TO BE

02:42:45.388 --> 02:42:48.191
SUCCESSFUL. WITHOUT SEEING

02:42:48.258 --> 02:42:49.159
EVERYTHING ELSE SO I TEND TO

02:42:49.226 --> 02:42:50.594
AGREE WITH. LEGISLATIVE

02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:52.863
ANALYST'S OFFICE HERE THAT THAT

02:42:52.929 --> 02:42:55.165
WE THROW NUMBERS AROUND. AND

02:42:55.232 --> 02:42:56.166
POTENTIALLY THROWING PEOPLE

02:42:56.233 --> 02:42:58.635
AROUND WITHOUT REALLY

02:42:58.702 --> 02:43:01.037
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT.

02:43:01.104 --> 02:43:03.440
COMPLEXITY OF THIS PROGRAM IS

02:43:03.507 --> 02:43:05.609
WHERE IT IT'S GOING TO BE HEADED

02:43:05.675 --> 02:43:08.178
AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

02:43:08.245 --> 02:43:10.013
TO DEVELOP CONSISTENTLY SERVICES

02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:11.982
IN EACH OF THE COUNTIES TO BE

02:43:12.048 --> 02:43:14.184
ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE. PEOPLE WHO

02:43:14.251 --> 02:43:17.487
ARE SWEPT UP IN INTO THIS SYSTEM

02:43:17.554 --> 02:43:19.756
SO I JUST DON'T IN THIS BUDGET I

02:43:19.823 --> 02:43:22.392
DON'T. KNOW THAT I HAVE A CLEAR

02:43:22.459 --> 02:43:24.461
UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE JUDICIAL

02:43:24.528 --> 02:43:25.595
COUNCIL THINKS THIS IS GOING TO

02:43:25.662 --> 02:43:28.565
GO. AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE

02:43:28.632 --> 02:43:29.966
HEADED SOMETHING THAT THAT THEY

02:43:30.033 --> 02:43:32.302
CAN BE SUCCESSFUL BUT- THERE ARE

02:43:32.369 --> 02:43:34.638
SOME MENTAL HEALTH COURTS IN IN

02:43:34.704 --> 02:43:36.006
VARIOUS COUNTIES THERE ARE SOME

02:43:36.072 --> 02:43:39.376
REALLY GOOD EXAMPLES. OF PEOPLE

02:43:39.442 --> 02:43:40.644
WHO ARE INTERACTING WITH THESE

02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:42.679
COURTS AND THAT THOSE ARE ALL

02:43:42.746 --> 02:43:44.347
BACKED UP WITH SERVICES BUT

EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSEM. L.

02:51:38.821 --> 02:51:40.757
LOOKS THE WAY THAT THE STATE

02:51:40.823 --> 02:51:42.659
AND- WE HAVE SPECIFICALLY-

02:51:42.725 --> 02:51:44.861
MANAGEMENT RESPONSE TO RECOVERS

02:51:44.927 --> 02:51:47.697

02:51:56.572 --> 02:51:58.441
ONLY THREE YEARS. AND WHILE I

ACKNOWLEDGE THAT LEO'S

02:52:00.376 --> 02:52:02.278
ASSESSMENT I SUPPORTED THE

02:52:02.345 --> 02:52:04.747
PRACTICAL IMPLICATION IS THAT

02:52:04.814 --> 02:52:06.849
THIS RESTRICTION MAKES HARD TO

02:52:06.916 --> 02:52:09.185

02:52:21.597 --> 02:52:23.132
CANDIDATES THAT THEIR EMPLOYMENT

02:52:23.199 --> 02:52:25.334
IS NOT PERMANENT. FOR MANY IT'S

02:52:25.401 --> 02:52:27.370
A DEAL BREAKER AND ACTUALLY IT'S

02:52:27.437 --> 02:52:29.906
A IT'S A HUGE DETAIL THAT WE

THAT DEPARTMENT BELIEVES IT IS

CONTINUING THOSE EFFORTS. I'M TO

02:57:05.247 --> 02:57:06.649
THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:57:08.417 --> 02:57:09.885

THE PROPOSAL. AND SPECIFICALLY

02:57:12.621 --> 02:57:14.924
WE WOULD RECOMMEND MAKING THAT

THIRTY SEVEN MILLION OF THE

NOTIFICATION- BEFORE THE FUNDS

REPORT SHOULD INCLUDE DETAILS ON

02:57:30.272 --> 02:57:31.707

RATIONALE FOR PURCHASING NEW PP

02:57:39.248 --> 02:57:40.449
ON THIS IS BECAUSE THE

02:57:40.516 --> 02:57:42.251
DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY STORING

02:57:42.318 --> 02:57:45.321
PP THAT IS ABOUT TO EXPIRE. AND

02:57:45.388 --> 02:57:46.822
THEN NEED TO REPLACE THIS

02:57:46.889 --> 02:57:48.824
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

THEY HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND

02:58:02.138 --> 02:58:03.205
SIXTY FIVE MILLION PIECES OF

FIFTY MILLION OF THAT IS

02:58:08.544 --> 02:58:11.480
EXPIRING SOON- AND SO IT JUST

02:58:11.547 --> 02:58:13.616
RAISES THE QUESTION OF HOW MUCH

02:58:13.682 --> 02:58:17.420
PP NEEDS TO BE STORED- IF WE

02:58:17.486 --> 02:58:19.455

THAT WE DON'T WE ACTUALLY DO

03:07:50.158 --> 03:07:52.828
NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THINGS ARE

03:07:52.894 --> 03:07:54.696
ARE PERISHABLE BECAUSE THAT IS A

03:07:54.763 --> 03:07:56.064
REAL CONCERN THAT WE PUT ALL THE

03:07:56.131 --> 03:07:58.667
STUFF IN A WAREHOUSE IN A COME

03:07:58.734 --> 03:08:01.536
TO THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE-

03:08:01.603 --> 03:08:04.072
WE GET THROUGH THIS AND YOU HAVE

03:08:04.139 --> 03:08:06.608
THESE MASKING THEIR- FOUR

03:08:06.675 --> 03:08:08.677
HUNDRED YEARS. EVERY TWO YEARS

03:08:08.744 --> 03:08:12.481
WITH. ROTATING THEM OUT. OF LIKE

03:08:12.547 --> 03:08:14.049
WE COULD HAVE BEEN DOING WITH

03:08:14.116 --> 03:08:15.183
THOSE SANDBAGS. CIVILISED COULD

03:08:15.250 --> 03:08:17.519
STILL BE BUYING FED BAGS RIGHT

03:08:17.586 --> 03:08:20.122
NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF A DROUGHT.

03:08:20.188 --> 03:08:22.624
SO I TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT

03:08:22.691 --> 03:08:26.395
WASTING MONEY. ON THINGS THAT-

03:08:26.461 --> 03:08:29.898
YES RIGHT NOW WE'RE WE'RE IN A

03:08:29.965 --> 03:08:31.400
FLOOD SITUATION WITH THE

03:08:31.466 --> 03:08:33.635
PANDEMIC BUT IT MAY NOT ALWAYS

03:08:33.702 --> 03:08:36.004
BE THAT WAY AND WE HAVE TO BE

03:08:36.071 --> 03:08:38.440
THAT SOMEONE SAID. MINDFUL OF-

03:08:38.507 --> 03:08:40.942
SOMEONE'S MONEY DAVID IS AS IT

03:08:41.009 --> 03:08:43.011
IS YOUR MONEY WOULD YOU CONTINUE

03:08:43.078 --> 03:08:44.946
TO PAY FOR SOMETHING YOU CAN'T

03:08:45.013 --> 03:08:45.914
USE EVERY YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER

03:08:45.981 --> 03:08:49.251
YEAR. SO I'M JUST PUTTING THAT

03:08:49.317 --> 03:08:56.858
OUT THERE. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:08:56.925 --> 03:08:58.894
REPRESENTED THAT THE OPERATION

03:08:58.960 --> 03:09:01.163
AND THEN YOU'RE RIGHT BOB I

03:09:01.229 --> 03:09:03.765
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE FOR

03:09:03.832 --> 03:09:06.535
EVERYONE IS THAT. THE PROBLEM.

03:09:06.601 --> 03:09:08.537
IS THE MASTER OF THE GORBALS

03:09:08.603 --> 03:09:10.605
ECCENTRIC BEACH ARE UTILIZED FOR

03:09:10.672 --> 03:09:12.207
NOT JUST THE PANDEMIC BUT FOR

03:09:12.274 --> 03:09:14.309
ALL HAZARDS RIGHT WE DEPLOYED

03:09:14.376 --> 03:09:16.845
BURKE WILDFIRE SMOKE- WHICH WE

03:09:16.912 --> 03:09:19.114
KNOW WE HAVE SEEN COME INTO.

03:09:19.181 --> 03:09:21.817
URBAN AREAS AND THAT YOU KNOW

03:09:21.883 --> 03:09:24.086
LAST YEAR THE CITY SAN FRANCISCO

03:09:24.152 --> 03:09:25.487
WAS ALMOST DEVELOPMENT WITH

03:09:25.554 --> 03:09:27.989
SMOKE AND SO WE'VE WE'VE USED IT

03:09:28.056 --> 03:09:29.891
AT SCHOOL FIVE SECONDS RIGHT

03:09:29.958 --> 03:09:31.626
WE'VE- PUSHED THEM OUT THAT

03:09:31.693 --> 03:09:33.528
BUSINESS EDITION OTHER TOP

03:09:33.595 --> 03:09:35.163
ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE THAT THE

03:09:35.230 --> 03:09:36.465
OUR ECONOMY COULD STILL BE

03:09:36.531 --> 03:09:38.967
MOVING RIGHT. SO WE TRY TO

03:09:39.034 --> 03:09:40.335
LEVERAGES BUDGET THAT IT'S

03:09:40.402 --> 03:09:42.137
POSSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO MEET ALL

03:09:42.204 --> 03:09:44.706
OF THAT THE RISKS AND THREATS

03:09:44.773 --> 03:09:46.742
BUT YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT BUT

03:09:46.808 --> 03:09:48.343
WHEN YOU HAVE A PERISHABLE ITEM

03:09:48.410 --> 03:09:50.145
WE'RE CONSTANTLY TALK ABOUT THE

03:09:50.212 --> 03:09:53.048
THINGS LIKE JUST SIXTEEN. A DISS

03:09:53.115 --> 03:09:55.016
THERE CONSTANTLY ROTATING AND

03:09:55.083 --> 03:09:57.319
ACCESSING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT

03:09:57.385 --> 03:10:00.021
ONLY DO WE HAVE UPDATED-

03:10:00.088 --> 03:10:01.389
COMMODITIES BUT ALL THE

03:10:01.456 --> 03:10:03.391
BATTERIES ARE CHARGED NOT BAD

03:10:03.458 --> 03:10:05.594
THAT GENERATORS ARE FUELED AND

03:10:05.660 --> 03:10:07.929
THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW A QUICK

03:10:07.996 --> 03:10:09.531
A QUICK MINUTES READY TO GO. AND

03:10:09.598 --> 03:10:11.266
THAT'S A CRITICAL FUNCTION

03:10:11.333 --> 03:10:12.868
JOHNSON PARTICULARLY IN A STATE

03:10:12.934 --> 03:10:14.703
LIKE THIS BOB HERTZBERG WE SEE

03:10:14.770 --> 03:10:16.872
ON ANOTHER EMERGENCIES AND

03:10:16.938 --> 03:10:18.507
DISASTERS THAT WERE ROTATED A

03:10:18.573 --> 03:10:21.409
LOT OF THINGS THE ANNUALLY- BUT-

03:10:21.476 --> 03:10:24.079
AND WE DO ALSO WORK TO GET. AS

03:10:24.146 --> 03:10:26.748
MUCH FEMA REIMBURSEMENT ALL IT'S

03:10:26.815 --> 03:10:29.284
CERTAINLY ALL THE STAFF FOR THE

03:10:29.351 --> 03:10:31.052
PANDEMIC CURRENTLY IT'S STILL AT

03:10:31.119 --> 03:10:33.221
A HUNDRED PERCENT- WEEK FIRST

03:10:33.288 --> 03:10:35.223
MET BY FEMA HANNAH BETH TOOK IT

03:10:35.290 --> 03:10:38.560
WILL CHANGE OUR DOG TO AT NINETY

03:10:38.627 --> 03:10:39.594
TEN SHORT FORMAT UNTIL THE

03:10:39.661 --> 03:10:41.596
EMERGENCY IS OVER AND THEN IT'LL

03:10:41.663 --> 03:10:43.498
BE A DIFFERENT STORY SO. PART OF

03:10:43.565 --> 03:10:45.667
THIS PROPERTY WE'RE DOING NOW IS

03:10:45.734 --> 03:10:46.835
REALLY EACH BUILDING THAT

03:10:46.902 --> 03:10:49.638
SUSTAINABLE THIS- YOU KNOW WE

03:10:49.704 --> 03:10:51.206
DON'T ACTUALLY THE FEDERAL.

03:10:51.273 --> 03:10:52.874
DOLLARS IN SUPPORT OF THAT WILL

03:10:52.941 --> 03:10:54.342
COME TO RIGHT NOW BUT THAT THE

03:10:54.409 --> 03:10:55.877
NEEDS AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR

03:10:55.944 --> 03:10:58.413
US TO. EXPORT THE SIXTY

03:10:58.480 --> 03:11:10.492
CALIFORNIA'S. AFTERWORLD WILL

03:11:10.559 --> 03:11:13.228
REMAIN. I JUST DIDN'T RESPOND TO

03:11:13.295 --> 03:11:15.130
THE- OF. THE TERM NEED- MADAM

03:11:15.197 --> 03:11:17.265
SHE THAT YOU WOULD ASK I THIS IS

03:11:17.332 --> 03:11:18.967
A ONE OF THOSE KINDS OF AYE.

03:11:19.034 --> 03:11:20.602
THAT WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE

03:11:20.669 --> 03:11:21.403
DEPARTMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO

03:11:21.469 --> 03:11:23.004
INCORPORATE INTO THIS STRATEGIC

03:11:23.071 --> 03:11:25.240
PLAN THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND I'M

03:11:25.307 --> 03:11:27.175
A RATHER THAN DOING THINGS IN A

03:11:27.242 --> 03:11:29.678
PEACEFUL MEAL FASHION. ON IF THE

03:11:29.744 --> 03:11:31.146
DEPARTMENT WERE TO COME UP WITH

03:11:31.213 --> 03:11:33.715
A PLAN FOR STORING PP IN THE

03:11:33.782 --> 03:11:36.451
NEXT YEAR AND THEN A YEAR LATER

03:11:36.518 --> 03:11:38.253
DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN. THAT

03:11:38.320 --> 03:11:39.788
MAYBE LAYS OUT A DIFFERENT

03:11:39.855 --> 03:11:41.456
STRUCTURE- OR DIFFERENT COLOR

03:11:41.523 --> 03:11:43.825
CAPACITY GOALS IDENTIFIES

03:11:43.892 --> 03:11:45.727
DIFFERENT TYPES OF THREATS THAT

03:11:45.794 --> 03:11:46.995
THE STATE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO

03:11:47.062 --> 03:11:48.496
RESPOND TO. ON THAT THAT MIGHT

03:11:48.563 --> 03:11:50.565
NOT ALIGN WITH WHAT THEY COME UP

03:11:50.632 --> 03:11:52.434
WITH AND SO- WE I THINK WE WOULD

03:11:52.500 --> 03:11:53.802
CAUTION AGAINST. DOING THINGS IN

03:11:53.869 --> 03:11:55.670
A PIECEMEAL PLAN- AND OBVIOUSLY

03:11:55.737 --> 03:11:57.405
THEY'RE SORT OF AN INTERIM NEED

03:11:57.472 --> 03:11:58.773
AS THE EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN

03:11:58.840 --> 03:12:00.742
PROCURED AND THE STATE DOES HAVE

03:12:00.809 --> 03:12:01.676
A NEED TO DISPERSE THIS

03:12:01.743 --> 03:12:04.145
EQUIPMENT-BUT WE WOULD HOPE

03:12:04.212 --> 03:12:05.080
THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING

03:12:05.146 --> 03:12:06.948
THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE

03:12:07.015 --> 03:12:08.783
PLAN AND- AND REALLY JUST THE

03:12:08.850 --> 03:12:09.551
SITUATION KIND OF HIGHLIGHTS.

03:12:09.618 --> 03:12:11.653
THE NEED FOR A PLAN ON ONGOING

03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:12.754
BASIS AS- THAT THE PROCUREMENT

03:12:12.821 --> 03:12:14.456
OF THE WAREHOUSES IN THE PP WAS

03:12:14.522 --> 03:12:15.657
DONE IN A VERY REACTIONARY

03:12:15.724 --> 03:12:17.359
FASHION WHEN. THE CALL THE

03:12:17.425 --> 03:12:19.494
PANDEMIC STARTED AS OPPOSED TO

03:12:19.561 --> 03:12:23.064
HAVING A MORE STRATEGIC APPROACH

03:12:23.131 --> 03:12:27.335
ON THE FRONTEND. THANK THANK YOU

03:12:30.705 --> 03:12:32.841
MOVE FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS

03:12:32.908 --> 03:12:34.009
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE

03:12:34.075 --> 03:12:37.913

OF THIS PARTICULAR- REQUEST

CONTINUAL APPLICATION YEAH- NEED

TO MEET THE EVER CHANGING.

03:14:39.567 --> 03:14:41.369
ENVIRONMENT THAT WE FACE IS A

03:14:41.436 --> 03:14:44.606
STATE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

03:14:44.672 --> 03:14:45.373
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AREN'T

03:14:45.440 --> 03:14:47.776
RESELLING IT AS A POSSIBLE

CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. HELLO

03:14:57.285 --> 03:14:58.887
AT JUST COMPUTERS THE WITH THE

03:14:58.953 --> 03:15:03.625
L. A. L. A. CAN AND SO WE WOULD

03:15:03.691 --> 03:15:05.560
DO IT WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL

03:15:05.627 --> 03:15:07.328
REALLY LACKS SUFFICIENT

03:15:07.395 --> 03:15:10.832
JUSTIFICATION AND I'M HAVING A

03:15:10.899 --> 03:15:12.600
BROAD BASED INCREASE IN

03:15:12.667 --> 03:15:14.536
TRAINING- WHAT TRAINING IS A

03:15:14.602 --> 03:15:15.603
VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF

03:15:15.670 --> 03:15:18.573
EMERGENCY RESPONSE- AGAIN THAT

03:15:18.640 --> 03:15:19.808
IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK WOULD

03:15:19.874 --> 03:15:22.043
BE BEST INFORMED BY AFTER THAT

03:15:22.110 --> 03:15:23.845
THE DEPARTMENT IS ABLE TO

03:15:23.912 --> 03:15:26.448
DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN- AND

03:15:26.514 --> 03:15:29.751
SO- WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE

03:15:29.818 --> 03:15:33.755
MOST OF THE REQUEST- HOWEVER WE

03:15:33.822 --> 03:15:35.924
DO THINK THAT SET THE SEVEN

03:15:35.990 --> 03:15:37.792
POSITIONS FOR VIRTUAL TRAINING.

03:15:37.859 --> 03:15:39.227
ON COULD BE REASONABLE

03:15:39.294 --> 03:15:40.895
ESPECIALLY ON A THREE YEAR

03:15:40.962 --> 03:15:42.097
LIMITED TERM BASIS THEY COULD BE

03:15:42.163 --> 03:15:43.731
REVISITED AFTER TO THE

03:15:43.798 --> 03:15:44.699
DEPARTMENT DEVELOPS A STRATEGIC
