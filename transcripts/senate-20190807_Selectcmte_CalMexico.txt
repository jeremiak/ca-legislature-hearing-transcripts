BARBER NEWTON THE PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA TRAVEL ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA TRAVEL ASSOCIATION IS THE VERY INFLUENTIAL UNIFIED VOICE OF TRAVEL AND THE TOURISM INDUSTRY CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A THRIVING INDUSTRY WE JUST WANT TO THANK HER FOR BEING HERE TODAY TAKING THE TIME. TO BE PART OF THIS PANEL THANK YOU WELCOME THANK YOU SENATOR WAY SO AND GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE. AS YOU SAID CALIFORNIA TRAVEL ASSOCIATION IS THE VOICE OF THE TRAVEL AND TOURISM INDUSTRY FOR THE STATE WE'RE ALSO KNOWN AS CAL TRAVEL. AND WE PROTECT IN ADVANCE THE INTERESTS AND INVESTMENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA. TRAVEL INDUSTRY THROUGH ADVOCACY COLLABORATION IN EDUCATION. SO OUR MEMBERS ARE MADE UP OF THE CITY'S DESTINATIONS HOTELS RESORTS AIRPORTS AIRLINES RENTAL CARS REALLY ANY ORGANIZATION FOR WHOM TRAVEL AND TOURISM IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR BUSINESS. IS A CATEGORY OF MEMBERSHIP FOR US. WE APPLAUD THE EFFORTS THAT A CENTER WHICH WAS MAKING TO LEVERAGE TOURISM. TO DEVELOP A POSITIVE BY NATIONAL IDENTITY AND A VIBRANT MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN MEXICO AND CALIFORNIA. AS CAROLINE SAID WE HAVE HAD WE'VE BENEFITED FROM NINE GREAT YEARS OF GROWTH IN THE TRAVEL AND TOURISM INDUSTRY AND CONTINUE TO SEE A VERY STRONG ECONOMY. BUT I ALSO TALK TO MEMBERS ABOUT WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES AND ISSUES THAT WE THAT WE FACE IN THERE ARE A FEW TROUBLING AREAS THAT WERE FOCUSED ON IN ADDITION TO THE NATIONAL MANMADE CHALLENGES AND THE NATURAL CHALLENGES WE PULLED OUR MEMBERS IN JULY ON WHAT FACTORS THEY THOUGHT COULD AFFECT THE TRAVEL AND TOURISM BUSINESS THE MOST IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. WE ASKED HIM TO WRITE THEIR ISSUES FROM ONE TO FIVE WITH FIVE BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT. A NATIONAL TRAVEL POLICIES WITH RATED FOUR POINT THREE OUT OF FIVE. CALIFORNIA'S IMAGE TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY FOUR POINT SIX TWO OUT OF FIVE. AND CALIFORNIA'S IMAGE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD FOUR POINT SEVEN SIX OUT OF FIVE SO MY MEMBERS ARE SAYING THAT THEY'RE- A REALLY CHALLENGED BY THE CLIMATE THAT WE'RE WORKING IN THESE CONCERNS RANK HIGHER THAN MANY OF OUR- HOT BUTTON ISSUES LIKE HOMELESSNESS WHICH WAS FOUR POINT. OH THREE OUT OF FIVE OR SUSTAINABILITY WHICH IS FOUR POINT ONE SIX OUT OF FIVE. SO I THINK THESE RESULTS SPEAK TO AWARENESS OF OUR STATE'S TRAVEL AND TOURISM INDUSTRY THAT WE REALLY NEED TO BE PROACTIVE IN KERR JING VISITORS TO COME TO OUR DESTINATIONS. WE DO EMBRACE ALL LEGITIMATE TRAVELERS I THINK YOU CAN SEE FROM THE MESSAGING THAT'S COMING OUT FROM VISIT CALIFORNIA AND ALSO FROM OUR INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS WE- SEE MANY OF THEM CREATING COMMERCIALS AND MESSAGING TO ENCOURAGE. NEIGHBORS ESPECIALLY FROM THE SOUTH TO VACATION IN CALIFORNIA REALLY SEND THAT WELCOMING. MESSAGE THAT WE ARE OPEN TO ALL AND WE LOVE TO HAVE THAT VISITATION. WE BELIEVE TRULY THAT TOURISM IS THE BEST WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO APPRECIATE DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW IN DIFFERENT CULTURES. SO WE CERTAINLY AT AT CAL TRAVEL WE UNDERSTAND THE DEEP INTERDEPENDENCE OF MEXICO IN CALIFORNIA FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR EMPLOYMENT FOR COMMERCE AND FOR QUALITY OF LIFE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. AND WE WANT TO SUPPORT POLICIES THAT INSURE THAT CONTINUED SUCCESS. AMONG OTHER STRATEGIES AT CAL TRAVEL OR ADVOCACY. EFFORTS SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT EASE OF TRAVEL ACROSS THE BORDER INVESTMENT IN OUR- REGIONAL AIRPORTS AND EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. WE WELCOME THIS DIALOGUE IN THIS OPPORTUNITY TO US TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF SURVEY SO AND ALL THE LEADERS HERE THANK YOU THANK YOU.

PITCH SHE'S A CEO FOR THE SENEGAL TOURISM AUTHORITY THE CENTER WITH. TOURISM AUTHORITY SIX TO IMPROVE TOURISM TO ECONOMICALLY BET BENEFITS SENEGAL REGION. TOURIST TOURISM IS THE SECOND LARGEST SEGMENT OF THE SEND YOU A CONDOM IN EMPLOYS APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE THE SENEGAL TOURISM AUTHORITY IS A PRIVATE NONPROFIT MUTUAL BENEFIT CORPORATION COMPOSED OF APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND.

THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT OUR WORK THAT WE DO TOGETHER. TO PROMOTE OUR BY NATIONAL REGION SO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TOURISM AUTHORITY WE ARE SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD WE'RE LOOKING PRETTY GOOD FOR SIXTY FIVE OR NON PROFIT SO WE'RE A FIVE OH ONE C. SIX AND OUR MISSION IS TO ECONOMICALLY BENEFIT THE SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY. SO WE ARE HERE TO HELP DRIVE THE TOURISM ECONOMY BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOOD STEWARDS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND CERTAINLY OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND NEIGHBORS TO THE SOUTH IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THAT. WE HAVE AN OPERATIONAL BUDGET THIS YEAR AT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SO WE'RE ABLE TO DO A GLOBAL MARKETING PROGRAMME FOR ACTUALLY MARKETING SAN DIEGO IN EIGHT COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. SO WE HAVE A WONDERFUL COMMUNITY THAT'S HERE THAT WORKS TOGETHER. FROM A TOURISM PERSPECTIVE FOR CONTEXT WE ARE A TOP FIVE DESTINATION FOR AMERICANS TO TRAVEL INTO OUR COMMUNITY IN THE ELEVENTH MOST VISITED FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVELERS OR TOP MEETING AND CONVENTION DESTINATION THAT STRONG FOUNDATIONAL BUSINESS FOR ANY COMMUNITY. WE HAD ALMOST THIRTY SIX MILLION VISITORS THIS LAST YEAR INTO SAN DIEGO AND WE'RE ONLY A POPULATION OF THREE POINT THREE MILLION WITHIN THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY AREA SO THAT'S TEN VISITORS FOR EVERYONE RESIDENTS. WE SEE THIS RELATIONSHIP TWO FOLD ONE IS MEXICO IS A MARKET INTO SAN DIEGO IT'S A MARKET INTO CALIFORNIA WE HAVE OVER FOUR POINT SIX MILLION VISITORS COME INTO SAN DIEGO ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. MANY OF THOSE ARE DAY VISITORS ARE COMING INTO DO TOURISM PURPOSES LIKE SHOPPING GO TO OUR TRACTION SKODA RESTAURANTS WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT STAY THE NIGHT FROM MEXICO HERE IN SAN DIEGO. AND MOSTLY IS TO VISIT FRIENDS AND FAMILY WE ARE VERY CONNECTED COMMUNITY THAT'S THE FABRIC OF WHO WE ARE BUT THEN THIS BY NATIONAL REGION SO PEOPLE COMING IN PRIMARILY TO SEE THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY BUT ALSO FOR LEISURE PURPOSES FOR VACATION. AND OF COURSE FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES AS WELL. WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE THAT WITH IN MEXICO WE HAVE REPRESENTATION FOR SAN DIEGO SO WE ARE WITH A GROUP CALLED PR CENTRAL THEY ARE BOOTS ON THE GROUND FOR US IN MEXICO CITY. THEY'RE DOING TRADE DEVELOPMENT THERE ALSO PROVIDING EDUCATION FOR TRAVEL AGENTS AND TOUR OPERATORS AND I SHOULD POINT OUT OF THE GENTLEMAN WHO ACTUALLY SUPERVISES THAT WORK WHICH IS BILL HANNAH'S. WAY FEEL MOST PEOPLE KNOW PHIL. HE'S BEEN ON BOARD WITH US FOR TWO YEARS NOW OVERSEEN THE WORK THAT PEER CENTRAL'S DOING AND OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. SO WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE THAT REPRESENTATION THAT EXTENDS OUR STAFF SOUTH OF THE BORDER. WE DO QUITE A BIT IN TERMS OF BRINGING PEOPLE INTO OUR COMMUNITY SO DOING PFAM TRIPS WERE SOMEBODY ACTUALLY TRAVELS INTO SAN DIEGO AND GETS THE EXPERIENCE OF SAN DIEGO. AND WE DO EVENTS WHERE WE GO INTO MEXICO AND WE TAKE OUR COMMUNITY DOWN TO MEET WITH OUR TRAVEL PARTNER SOUTH OF THE BORDER. SO WE'RE- ALWAYS DOING EVENTS WERE DOING SALES MISSIONS WE DO GROUPS WORRY BRING MEDIA OVER INTO OUR COMMUNITY OR WE BRING OTHER AGENTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD IT JUST SAN DIEGO. AND OFTEN TIMES WERE DOING NOT ONLY SAN DIEGO BUT ALSO BAJA CALIFORNIA AS WELL. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE SUCCESSFULLY AS WORK TOGETHER WITH BEST DAY WHICH IS AN OTA OUT OF THE MEXICO MARKET. TALKING ABOUT THE KELLY BAJA EXPERIENCE SO THIS IS A TWO NATION VACATION WERE PROMOTING A STAY IN SAN DIEGO AND I STAY IN BAJA. WE WERE ABLE TO DO THIS THROUGH ACTIVATIONS WITH ADVERTISING THAT WE DID IN MEXICO WE WERE ALSO DOING A PRESENCE AT MALLS AROUND MEXICO PRIMARILY MEXICO CITY. SO PROMOTING THAT AS A TRAVEL PACKAGE THAT YOU COULD BUY THROUGH BEST DAY SO THAT'S BEEN ONE THAT'S A VERY TANGIBLE EXAMPLE OF HOW COMMUNITIES CAN WORK TOGETHER. TO PUT TOGETHER A TANGIBLE PRODUCT THAT CAN BE PURCHASED. WE ALSO HAVE A VERY STRONG PUBLIC RELATIONS PROGRAM OF WORK AND WE OFTEN SAY THAT JUST BRINGING PEOPLE INTO THE COMMUNITY AND LETTING THEM HOW THAT EXPERIENCE SO FOR A TRAVEL WRITER TO COME IN. AND TO COME TO SAN DIEGO AND TO ALSO GO INTO THE BAJA COMMUNITY IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN RESONATING AS A STORY. EARLIER THIS YEAR TRAVEL AND LEISURE TALKED ABOUT THE SAN DIEGO BAHAR REGION AS BEING THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS IT'S TRULY AN AN AN IMPRESSIVE STORY TO BE TOLD AND ONE THAT HAS RESONATED WITH TRAVEL WRITERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. NOW WE ALSO WORK WITH THE BAJA CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY AS TOURISM PARTNERS IN S. DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS WE HAVE SIGNED LETTERS OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR COMMUNITY AND ALSO WITH TIJUANA AND IN SIN NADA. WE'VE DONE SIGNING AGREEMENTS TALKING ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE DO COLLABORATIVE LATE WE PROMOTE EACH OTHER ON EACH OTHER'S WEBSITES WE PROMOTE EACH OTHER WITHIN OUR VISITOR GUIDE INFORMATION WE'VE DONE PROGRAMS LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THE- BAJA CALIFORNIA BEST OF EXPERIENCE THROUGH THE O. T. A.'S. WE'RE VERY ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THOSE GROUPS LIKE THIS WITH THE SELECT COMMITTEE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE WORK TOGETHER AND HOW WE WORK TOGETHER BETTER SO WHETHER IT BE THE SMART BORDER COALITION. OR THE REGIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MANY DIFFERENT PARTNERS TO KEEP THAT DIALOGUE IN THOSE COMMUNICATIONS OPENED AND STRONG. AND OF COURSE I MENTIONED EARLIER C. B. ACTS IN THE T. ONE AIRPORT VERY IMPORTANT TO THE SAN DIEGO REGION AND OUR REGIONAL ECONOMY. SO I'M GOING TO END WITH A TV SPOT THAT WE'VE BEEN RUNNING IN THE MEXICO MARKET SO YOU COULD SEE HOW WE'RE PROMOTING IN SAN DIEGO. BUT AGAIN WE DO TALK VERY MUCH ABOUT THIS BEING A BI NATIONAL REGION AND IT'S A STORY THAT WE TAKE OUT. CONSTANTLY. VIEW MUCH FOR HAVING US TODAY APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. WE'LL HEAR A NOW FROM CITY GONE ABOUT THEM FOR GRAVES PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE SOUTH COUNTY. EDC WHICH IS BANNED A PROMOTER BRING IN INVESTMENTS TO THE SOUTH BAY SO IF YOU GIVE US A PERSPECTIVE ON. THE ECONOMIC INVESTMENT PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH STANDARD AWAY SO IN THANK YOU FOR HOSTING THIS AND TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR BEING IN SOUTH BAY TODAY WE APPRECIATE THIS. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO APPLAUD THE COMMITTEE FOR INVESTIGATING THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOINTLY MARKET THE STATES OF CALIFORNIA AND BAJA CALIFORNIA. FROM AN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE TOURISM DOLLARS OR SOME OF THE BEST DOLLARS YOU CAN BRING INTO THE REGION FOR ONE SIMPLE FACT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN ON VACATION LATELY BUT USUALLY YOU BRING UP FAT WALLET WITH YOU. YOU SPEND A LOT OF MONEY IN HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS AND EXPERIENCES AND YOU BUY ALL SORTS OF THINGS. AND THEN YOU GO HOME. AND THE REASON WHY THAT'S GOOD IS BECAUSE YOU LEAVE YOUR TAX DOLLARS HERE AND TYPICALLY DON'T USE THE SERVICES THAT TAX DOLLARS NORMALLY PROVIDE SO WE'RE TAKING THE T. O. T. DOLLARS FROM YOU AND REINVESTING THOSE BACK INTO THE COMMUNITIES WHERE YOU ARE. WE'RE ALSO TAKING THE SALES TAX FROM THE TOURISTS AND NOT USING THEM BUT TO SERVE THOSE TERRORISTS TYPICALLY RIGHT THEY GO HOME BUT REINVESTING IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES AND CONTINUE. IN DOLLARS THE OTHER THING THAT TOURISM DOESN'T IF WE DO OUR JOBS CORRECTLY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IT MEANS SO WE'LL GIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO SOME OF OUR PARTICULARLY SMALLER BUSINESSES. TO HAVE NEW A NEW AND EXPANDED CUSTOMER BASE WITH NEW TOURISTS COMING TO SPEND SOME OF THAT MONEY IN THEIR WALLETS I WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU BECAUSE I DO THINK TO REMIT TOURISM IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ASSETS THAT WE HAVE IN THE SAN DIEGO TO ONE AREA. AND JUST TO SHOW YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SAN DIEGO PARTICULARLY ANGELA VISTA I JOIN WITH FAMILIES TO CALL ANY INITIAL VISTA AND THE PORT OF STANDING ON THE CITY OF CHULA VISTA. IN CELEBRATING THE FACT THAT WE JUST HAD A BRAND NEW HOTEL AND CONVENTION CENTER PROVED ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO IT IS THROUGH THE REDEVELOPMENT IT'LL BE A SIXTEEN HUNDRED ROOM HOTEL MINIMUM. WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FEET A CONVENTION CENTER AND THAT IS ONE OF SEVERAL OPEN HOTEL PADS THAT ARE GOING TO BE HAPPENING ON THE CHULA VISTA BAY FRONT. DREAM WITH ME FOR A SECOND OKAY WE KEEP SAYING. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF ROOM AT THE CONVENTION CENTER AT THE SAN DIEGO CONVENTION CENTER WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WE'RE GONNA EXPAND. WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT EXPANSION HAPPENED WE DO SUPPORT THAT EXPANSION THERE SOMETHING ELSE WE CAN DO AND THAT WOULD BE TO CREATE A WATER TAXI SO WHEN YOU'RE AT COMIC CON WILL SAY AT THE CONVENTION CENTER INSTEAD OF TELLING YOU GET IN YOUR CAR AND DRIVE TO CHULA. TAKE IT AND GOING TO ONE OF THE HOTELS ALONG THE COASTLINE IN BAJA CALIFORNIA. IT'S POSSIBLE AND WE CAN DO THAT WE JUST HAVE TO DREAM BIG AND THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF BY NATIONAL TOURISM IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SAYING HEY COME TO BOTH OF US HERE ITS ABOUT THE CONNECTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE. OBVIOUSLY THE CROSS BORDER EXPRESSED A CROSS BORDER TERMINAL JORGE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GREAT THINGS THAT WE DID IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR PORTS OF ENTRY IS ESSENTIAL TO MAKING THIS WORK. BUT WE CAN DO BETTER AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD CHALLENGE THIS COMMITTEE SENATORS TO DO IS TO NOT ONLY MARKET OR BY NATIONAL AREAS BUT INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO TRULY MAKE IT CONNECTED AND TRULY MAKE IT A BI NATIONAL EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE SOME UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES HERE IN THE CALIFORNIA BAR HIGH AREA THAT ARE ALREADY SERVED LIKE WE'VE ALREADY MENTIONED A CROSS BORDER EXPRESS. BUT THEN ALSO SOME OF OUR CRUISE SHIPS AND THEN OF COURSE CARS WALKING ACROSS THE BORDER ALL THAT STUFF WORKS. IF WE BAND TOGETHER. WE CAN SHARE OUR RESOURCES WE COULD MARKET THIS AS ONE THE WHOLE REGION BOTH THE STATE ABOUT HOT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO THE REST OF THE WORLD AND DO IT MORE FOR DO SURELY RESPONSIBLE YEAH I SHOULD SAY THAT MORE COULD USUALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER THAN WE CURRENTLY DO WITH BAJA MARKETING BAJA CALIFORNIA MARKETING. CALIFORNIAN SAYING YOU GET TWO FOR ONE LET'S REALLY MAKE IT TWO FOR ONE LET'S JUST TALK JUST TALK ABOUT IT LET'S DO IT. LET'S MAKE IT THIS GREAT THING TO WHERE WE'RE PULLING OUR RESOURCES AND HITTING THE REST OF THE WORLD. I KIND OF KNOW THAT IF YOU LIVE IN SAN DIEGO YOU KIND OF KNOW ABOUT. THE BAR HIGHER AND IF YOU LOOK BEHIND YOU KIND. OF KNOW ABOUT CALIFORNIA. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE SO MUCH BIODIVERSITY HERE THAT PEOPLE ENJOYING CAN SEE THAT WE NEED TO TREAT DREAM JUST A LITTLE BIT BIGGER. AND THEN MORE CAR TO IMPLEMENT IT. I WANT TO ALSO LEAVE YOU WITH AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING IN SOUTH COUNTY DC DID THAT I THINK MIGHT MAKE. THE TOURISM HITS A LITTLE BIT EASIER AND ACTUALLY IT'S A CREDIT TO OUR KERRY AND HER TEAM. SO CAN EIGHTY C. REPRESENTS A CITY OF CHULA VISTA NATIONAL CITY IMPERIAL BEACH CORONADO. THE SOUTHERN PART OF SAN DIEGO AND THE COMMUNITIES OF ALL TIME I AM ANITA. AND WE EMBARKED ON A TOURISM EFFORT CALLED SAN DIEGO SOUTH BAY WE HAD NOT WORKED TOGETHER TO DO MARKET IN A JOINT COHESIVE MANNER. AND THIS COLLABORATIVE EFFORT ALLOWED US TO. EXPOSE PEOPLE TO WHAT IS TRADITIONALLY OVERLOOKED. AND TOURISM OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SOUTH BAY AND TO BEGIN WITH THIS WE STARTED WITH THE VOLUNTEER TASK FORCE. WE CREATED A WEBSITE AND SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM AND THAT ALLOWED. MANY MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO IMPORT THEIR INFORMATION ON TO THIS WEBSITE AND ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA. BUT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL THING WE DID. WAS WE PARTNERED WITH THE SAN DIEGO TOURISM. AUTHORITY WE MET WITH JOE TURGEON SAID JOE. WE'RE MISSING IT SOUTH COUNTY COULD BE SO MUCH BETTER ON YOUR WEBSITE WE CAN GIVE YOU THE STUFF AND TO THEIR CREDIT. AND I'M STILL GRATEFUL TO THIS DAY THEY SAID GIVE US WHAT YOU'VE GOT. GIVE US YOUR PICTURES GIVE US YOUR YOUR ARTICLES GIVE US EVERYTHING WE OKAY. MAYBE A COUPLE HUNDRED KIDS TO EXPOSURE TO OVER TWO MILLION VISITORS A VISIT THEIR SITE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAT'S THE KIND OF EXPOSURE WE CAN HAVE AND I THINK BY PARTNERING IN CROSS PROMOTING EACH OTHER WE CAN DO THIS IN A BETTER WAY I THINK BY WORKING TOGETHER AND TRULY GETTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN CAN ACTUALLY BRING THE TYPE OF TOURISM THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS WORK AND THEN LASTLY IF WE DO IT IN A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER BY POLINA RESOURCES INSTEAD OF JUST MENTION IT AT ALL BY THE WAY THERE'S JUST AND THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THIS A TRULY BY NATIONAL EFFORT AND I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. VERY NICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE GLOBAL ECONOMY BEGAN WHEN THE FIRST ROAD WAS BUILT BETWEEN ONE COMMUNITY IN ANOTHER IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND. AND ROADS ARE WHAT CONNECT COMMUNITY IT'S ROADS ARE PRIMARILY USED FOR TRADE. AND EVERY TIME WE INVEST IN BUILDING A CONNECTION IT'S SOMETHING THAT HELPS TO INCREASE OUR ECONOMY AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT IN A STUDY THAT WE DID HERE IN SENEGAL COUNTY THAT REDUCING BORDER WAIT TIMES. HELPS CAN CAN INCREASE CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO THE ECONOMY TO THE TUNE OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND I'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD TO DO THAT. WE ESTABLISHED A FUND A PORTS FUND. THAT WAS DESIGNED TO REDUCE PORTER WAIT TIMES AND WE DEPOSITED TO UNDER FIFTY MILLION AS OUR STATE'S CONTRIBUTION TO DO THIS. AND WE'RE ACTIVELY PURSUING THOSE LOCAL PROJECTS BORDER PROJECTS PORCH PROJECTS THAT WILL HELP. IN THE AREA OF TRADE BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO GROWING OUR ECONOMY OUR NEXT SPEAKER CORE CORE OKAY WOULD TALK TO A. IS THE CEO OF CROSS BORDER EXPRESS A PROJECT THAT I HAD THE PLEASURE OF WORKING ON WHEN I WAS ON THE COUNCIL HERE IN SAN DIEGO AND WE HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE HERE.

MISTER GORE TALKED TO A IS THIS IS A NINE THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR BRIDGE THAT CONNECTS THE TIJUANA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WITH A COMMUNITY OF ALL TIME MASON SANDIEGO AND IT IS THE FIRST BUILDING OF ITS KIND TO CONNECT THE USA TO A FOREIGN AIRPORT TERMINAL. AND IT IS BEEN AN ENORMOUS SUCCESS IT WAS ENVISIONED IT WAS IT JUST TOOK AMAZING VISION TO SUGGEST THIS PROJECT.

MORE MEMBERS EVERY SINGLE DAY AND I THOUGHT THAT'D BE VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND SHARING.

AS YOU MENTIONED THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PROJECT ON I SEND PRETTY NEW IN THE IN THE REGION. EVERY TIME THAT I INTERACT WITH PEOPLE I HEAR THESE ARE COMMENTS OF EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN SO WE'RE VERY VERY HONORED TO BE PART OF THE COMMUNITY. UNTIL CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TOURISM INDUSTRY I'M ON THE REGION SO NO QUESTION THAT THE RELATION BETWEEN MEXICO AND U. S. IS KEY I'M FOR US FOR CROSS BORDER EXPRESS HE'S HE'S THE SOLE. WILSON ALL CROSS BORDER EXPRESS ASK PHOEBE X. I'M DONE LET ME SURE THAT FOR MISCONCEPTION ON A WE TENDED TO CHANGE THE POWER OF THE HOME OF TRANSPORTATION BETWEEN. THE US AND I'M MEXICO'S SPECIALLY FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO MEXICO OFFERING A FASTER AND MORE CONVENIENT WAY TO CROSS THAT. BC'S BORDER OF THE WORLD. AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT.

ORTON INVOLVED AND NOW HE'S ON A SO TO TWENTY REPORT HAS ALWAYS WIEN. I NEVER FOR THAT HE'S USE FOR NOT ONLY FOR MEXICAN AMERICANS BUT. FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RACY THAT'S. AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF. THE CLINIC TV THAT THE HORN AIRPORT HAS. RELEASED A NUMBER TO A REPORT IN TERMS OF DIRECT CONNECTIONS FROM MEXICO WE'RE GONNA END UP THE YEAR WITH. THIRTY SIX DIRECT CD SERVED BY T.

THE TOURISM CAN COMMON GOAL FROM C. V. X. HE I MEAN EXPERIENCE EAST TO NATION BUT CATION EXPERIENCE SO OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS OF SENATOR WAS SO MANSION ON WILL BE BUILDING MUCH MORE THINGS MORE SURPRISES TO COME. WE HAVE FORTY THREE ACRES OF LAND ON OUR EXPECTATION NEEDS TO BUILD HOTELS ONE OR TWO HOTELS A FIELD DECIDED CONFERENCE CENTER RESTAURANT MERRY KERR CENTER ON PARK OUR ADDITIONAL PARKING LOTS OUR SERVICE CENTER GAS STATION. SO WE WANNA REALLY COULDN'T THREE B. EIGHT AND BE A DETONATOR OF THE ECONOMY. IN IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION CURRENTLY THERE'S MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED JOBS CREATED ON WE LOOK FORWARD TO CREATE MUCH MORE IN THE COMING FIELD. THE NATIONS IN MEXICO ARE TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO BE SEEN BUT ALSO. FROM THE CALIFORNIA TOURISM INDUSTRY TO PURSUE THESE PASSENGERS TO CALM AND UCV X. AND DEVELOP THE TOURISM INDUSTRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS BACK CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN AN ENORMOUS. DEVELOPMENT OF. A VERY EXCITING TOURISM INDUSTRY. IT'S SEENA A DIVERSIFICATION OF ALL OF THE PROGRAMS AND CULTURAL SERVICES AND CULTURAL RESOURCES AND THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS JUST BECOME. A WONDERFUL PLACE TO VISIT IN THE WORLD. AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANYBODY SPEAKING VERY HONESTLY THAT HAS HAD MORE TO DO THAT WITH THAT. DONE OUR NEXT SPEAKER US SECRETARY OF TOURISM ABOUT CALIFORNIA WAS KIND OF SCHOOL WITHOUT THROUGH HIS VARIOUS ROLES AS A BUSINESSMAN THROUGH THEIR THEIR CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SCHOOL PART OF MAX AND THROUGH CANNOT CALL AND AS HIS CURRENT ROLE AS THE SECRETARY OF TOURISM FOR THE STATE OF. CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SEEN JUST WONDERFUL THINGS HAPPEN IN BY CALIFORNIA OUT THAT LYNN TO ALL THE- GREAT PLACES PEOPLE HAVE TO GO AND VISIT. THE FOOD SCENE AND TAKE ONE IS NOW INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED THE CULTURAL RESOURCES THAT ARE STARTING TO APPEAR IN IN BAJA ARE ARE SECOND TO NONE. AND WE ARE JUST VERY HONORED TO HAVE HIM HERE TODAY AND BE PART OF THIS PANEL AND WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME. SECRETARIAL WAS CUT US THIS CALL WILL BE A MANY THOUGH SEEING THAT. I SUPPOSE THANK GOODNESS KNOWS WHICH SOME OF MY OWN BROTHERS. I WANT TO THANK THE SENATORS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND TO MAKE PUBLIC THE NECESSITY TO DO SOMETHING WITH TOURISM BETWEEN TWO NATIONS. HELLO CARLOS. MANY OF US ON THE AISLE THE ONE. I MEAN JUST ALMOST. BETWEEN WHAT DOES SENATOR WESSEL HAS SAID AND HOTTER HERE I HAVE NOTHING LEFT. I JUST WANT TO MENTION A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT BAJA CALIFORNIA. LAST YEAR WE HAD TWENTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE WHO VISITED THE STATE. OUT OF THOSE SIXTEEN POINT FIVE ACCORDING TO C. B. P. WERE PEOPLE FROM ACROSS THE BORDER. WHO VISITED BY HOW BY LAND. OUT OF THOSE AMAZING 82% OF OUR PEOPLE FROM CALIFORNIA SO FOR US IT'S A BIG IT'S A HUGE HUGE MARKET. BUT ALSO WE'VE GROWN. AS FAR AS THE MEXICAN MARKET. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 80% OF OUR TOURISM MARKET WAS FROM THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER RIGHT NOW EVEN THOUGH IT IT HAS INCREASED WE HAVE A 55% FROM THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER. AND 45% FROM THE INTERIOR OF MEXICO. SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED FOR EXAMPLE A FOUR YEARS AGO WE HAD THREE POINT NINE PEOPLE AT THE D. ONE AIRPORT THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE THAN EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE IN TIJUANA AIRPORT. BUT NOT ONLY IN TIJUANA MEXICO ONLY FOR THE FIRST TIME HAD OR MILLION PASSENGERS BY OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR WHICH IS 46% INCREASE. IN PASSENGERS FOR MEXICO SO THIS HAS BEEN THIS IS A VERY GREAT WE'VE I'VE ALSO HAD MILLION PASSENGERS ON THE CRUISE LINES. SO THAT FOREIGN SONATA WHICH IS NUMBER. ONE IN THE PACIFIC IT'S ALSO EXTRAORDINARY. BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THIS HOW DID THIS CAME ABOUT FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE OF KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE TO WORK ON A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT WE DID NOT HAVE TO SELL DESTINATIONS. WE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE. IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT THE FIVE STAR HOTEL IT'S ABOUT YOUR FIVE SENSES. SO WHICH CHANGED THE WHOLE STRATEGY OF HOW WE DID THINGS. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WE HAVE A STRATEGIC MARKETS THAT HAVE BEEN VERY VERY GOOD FOR US. BUT I'LL THOSE MARKETS THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING WITH CALIFORNIA. WHICH THE TRUTH OF IT WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH. FOR EXAMPLE. IT WAS MENTIONED HERE THAT WE CAN DO THE TWO NATION VACATION BUT WE CAN ALSO DO TO NATION CONVENTION. WE CAN DO HALF OF THE CONVENTION IN MEXICO HALF OF THE CONVENTION THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER WE HAVE SEND OUT A THOUSAND METER OR WE CAN HAVE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THIS CONVENTION CENTER WHICH IS ON GROUND LEVEL THAT MEANS WE CAN DO. EXPOSITION ON MACHINERY AND HAVE A CONVENTION ON MACHINERY ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER. WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE. BUT ALSO. WE CAN DO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY AS FAR AS TOURISM AS FAR AS THE FILM INDUSTRY TOURISM. LAST YEAR WE HAD. SEVENTY SEVEN. BIG FILMS. FILMED IN BAJA CALIFORNIA. WE CAN DO A LOT IF WE GO HAND IN HAND WITH FILM TOURISM. OR WITH CALIFORNIA WHICH SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY WE HAVE NOT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. ALSO WE HAVE FLIGHTS FROM CHINA WHICH I THINK IT COULD BE EXTRAORDINARY FOR SELLING CALIFORNIA TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND DO A TWO NATION VACATION WITH THE CHINESE MARKET WHICH IS A HUGE MARKET AS YOU ALL KNOW BUT ALSO YOU HAVE TO FLIGHTS FOR EUROPE WHICH THIS IN ABOUT NINETY FOUR NO FROM EUROPE IT'S COMPLICATED. WE CAN DO IT TO NATION VACATION WITH WITH EUROPE AND THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SPEND SIX DAYS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO SPEND FOUR AND SPENT TWO IN BASRA THIS MEANS IS THIS THESE GUYS WILL SPEND TEN DAYS IN THE REGION WHICH WILL BE HELPFUL FOR BOTH OF US. AND THAT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY THAT WE ALSO HAVE. ALSO IN ADVENTURE BAJA CALIFORNIA IS EXTRAORDINARY FOR TOURISM IN ADVENTURE LIKE CALIFORNIA BUT WE CAN GO HAND IN HAND WHAT HAS THAT CAN'T BE DONE ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER CAN BE DONE ON THAT SIDE OF THE BORDER FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES. WHEN WE JOIN TOGETHER ON BOTH SIDES CAN BE SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY. ALSO WITH THEM IN DOING EXTRAORDINARY GOOD. GREAT AS FAR AS MEDICAL TOURISM FRANCO YOU'LL- WON'T LET ME LIVE HERE. HERE LET ME EXAGGERATE ABOUT ABOUT ALLY. WE HAVE A LAST YEAR A TWO POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE VISIT BAJA CALIFORNIA FOR MEDICAL TOURISM. IF WE CAN DO SOME OF THE SERVICES FOR ON THAT SIDE OF THE BORDER AND SOME OF THE SERVICES ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER I KNOW MEDICAL TOURISM FROM CALIFORNIA SOMETHING YOU'RE LOOKING INTO GREATLY I THINK WE CAN DO SOMETHING IN HAND IN HAND AND HAVE MORE TOURISM MEDICAL TOURISM. ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. ALSO WE'VE MENTIONED BEFORE I SHOW THE VIDEO I HAVE TWO MORE COMMENTS FIRST. WE I MENTIONED THE CAMPAIGN OURSELVES WERE WE'RE NOT SELLING DESTINATIONS BUT EXPERIENCE LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING WE WON THE VEST. TOURISM VIDEO IN THE WORLD WE HAD THIS RECOGNITION IN PORT ALSO. A SPAIN WHICH OUT OF FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE COMPETE IT COMPETED WE WERE NUMBER ONE WHICH IS THE VIDEO GOING TO SHOW YOU AND WE HAD OUR VIDEO FOR FOODIES WHICH WE'VE DONE EXTRAORDINARY CZARIST FORTIES OUT OF TWENTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE VISITED THE STATE 32% THEY DID FOR THE FOOD FOR THE WIND OR FOR THE CRAFT BEER. ALSO THAT CAMPAIGN GOT AS NUMBER TWO IN CONTEXT SO WE'VE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB AND I HOPE WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB COMBINED WITH CALIFORNIA. THIS IS WAS SOMETHING I WASN'T GOING TO MENTION SENATOR. BUT YOU MENTIONED WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT C. B. X. LAST YEAR IN WASHINGTON WE HAD A MEETING WITH C. B. P. AND WE TOLD THEM THAT. IS HOW THE TRAIN CROSSES THE BORDER RIGHT NOW TO DELIVER MERCHANDISE AND IT GOES BACK AND FORTH. WE COULD DO SOMETHING WITH A CHARLIE. WE HAVE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE USING THAT TROLLEY WHICH COULD BE A PRE CLEARANCE TROLLEY LIKE WE DO IN CENTURY. YOU WOULD HAVE LESS TRAFFIC AND IT WOULD BE A QUICK MOMENT OF YOU OF HAVING INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALMOST THERE. THERE WOULD BE NO. NOT LOTS OF MONEY THAT WOULD BE NEEDED AND FOR SECURITY PURPOSES ACCORDING TO C. B. P. IN WASHINGTON SAID IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO CHECK PEOPLE ON ONE TROLLEY THAN TO CHECK NINE THOUSAND VEHICLES SO THAT'S SOMETHING I LEAVE ON THE TABLE THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN WORK WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION OF THE FOLLOWING ADMINISTRATION. IF YOU THINK WE CAN DO SOMETHING WITH IT. SO LET ME SHOW YOU I THINK WE HAVE THE VIDEO I'VE BRAGGED ABOUT ALL. OF THIS TIME. THIS IS AN INVITATION. FOR THOSE WHO PREFER THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED. FOR THOSE WHO WANT MORE THAN YOUR. THOSE LOOKING FOR THE UNIQUE THE EXCITING. GENUINE. AND THOSE LOOKING TO TRULY FEEL TO DISCOVER NEW SITES. PERSPECTIVES. TO TASTE ALL THAT THE OCEAN AND SO I'LL HAVE TO OFFER. BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE FIVE STAR HOTEL. IT'S ABOUT THE FIVE. IT'S ABOUT OPEN SPACE. IT'S ABOUT ENJOYING THE JOURNEY AS MUCH AS THE DESTINATION. IT'S ABOUT THE MOMENTS THAT MAKE TIME STUFF. AND REMIND US WHAT REALLY MATTERS. IT'S ABOUT CONNECTING. WITH NATURE. LIVE. AND IN MY COLLECTION REALIZE. PLEASE WITH THE LANDSCAPE EVERY STEP. WHEN THE SUN RISES. PLEASE STAY WITH. SO COME ALONG ALL THE DENTURES. PEOPLE TIRED OF THE SAME OLD THING. I WAS LOOKING TO EXPLORE DISCOVER AND EXPERIENCE A DIFFERENT. ONE ZERO TWO THREE THREE. ISN'T JUST A PLACE IT'S AN INVITATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR ATTENTION.

DOWN TO THE SOUTH OF US SO I SEE THE FUTURE IS INCREDIBLY BRIGHT FOR A PARTNERSHIP THAT EMBRACES THIS TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE. THAT SEES THE TAX BENEFITS OF THAT KIND OF TOURISM GROWTH AND OPENS OUR ARMS TO WITH THOSE THANK. YOU CHAIRMAN WAY SO FOR A GIVEN THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU AND ANYONE ELSE CENTER I'LL. I ALSO WANT TO THINK GUNS ANYWAY SO FOR PROPONENTS TOGETHER AND ALL THE GREAT SPEAKERS IT'S REALLY BEEN FANTASTIC I I'VE BUT NO SOONER WAS SO THANKS A LOT OF PEOPLE I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK A GROUP IS VERY SPECIAL TO ME THAT'S THE AUDIO VISUAL PEOPLE. AND THAT'S BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN FROM LOS ANGELES AND WATCH AND NOT NOT MISS A BEAT ON THE ON THE HEARING SO I APPRECIATE YOU THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOW DOING ALL UP AND DOWN THE STATE EVERY SINGLE HEARING NO MATTER WHERE IT IS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS LIVE STREAM FOR FOLKS TO TUNE IN SO THEY CAN KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR STATE SENATE AND INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY SO I APPRECIATE THAT A GREAT DEAL I YOU KNOW I'M EXCITED THAT WE'RE WE'RE ACTUALLY AND THEY'RE GONNA GET A CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE SOME OF THINGS THAT WERE. ON THE VIDEOS BUT I WANT TO GET. A BETTER SENSE FROM EVERYBODY ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW HOW THINGS WORK IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR TOURISM PROMOTION AND IN BOTH IN THE IN BOTH OF OUR RESPECTIVE STATES AND HOW HOW THAT YOU THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR FUNDS FOR THIS KIND OF WORK AND- AND YOU KNOW LET THE VIDEOS LOVE THAT LOVE THE AS I MEAN YOU WANT TO. TRAVEL BOTH STATES MORE SUBLET ASK THE PANEL ABOUT ABOUT HOW THAT THE FUNDING MECHANISMS WORK. SURE SO FOR CALIFORNIA CITIES MOST OF US ARE FUNDED THROUGH AN ASSESSMENT THROUGH TOURISM MARKETING DISTRICT. THAT ASSESSMENT IS CHARGED ON VISITORS INTO HOTEL ROOMS THAT GOES TO A BOARD THAT THEN ALLOCATES THOSE FUNDS. SO FOR SAN DIEGO IT'S THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO TOURISM MARKETING DISTRICT IS WHAT PROVIDES OUR FUNDS. WE RECEIVE NO FUNDING FROM THE GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY. BUT THAT THIS IS A BAD DISTRICT IS THAT ANTI EARLY VOLUNTARY OR IT'S ESTABLISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT ALL OF THOSE IT'S LEGISLATED BY THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. AND IT IS A SELF ASSESSMENT AND IT IS HAS CRITERIA IN TERMS OF IT BEING A BENEFIT DISTRICT BUT THE HOTEL'S VOTING TO SS THEMSELVES AND THEIR GAS. NOW IF YOU ARE ON SO. NOW IF A HOTEL IS WITHIN THE DISTRICT BUT DID NOT VOTE TO MAKE HE SAYS BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO PAY. IF YOU MEET THE CRITERIA OF THE ASSESSMENT DISTRICT IN EVERY DISTRICT IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FOR THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IT'S HOTELS WITH SEVENTY ROOMS FOR MORE HI THAT ARE ASSESSED IN IF YOU HAVE A MAJORITY OF THOSE ASSESSED ROOMS. AND PROPERTIES TO VOTE YES TO DO THAT THEN YES IT IS AN ASSASSIN SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON HOTELS CORRECT ONLY HOTELS. OKAY AND SEND YOU A WE ALSO THERE'S THAT MECHANISM IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO AND IN ALL CITIES INCLUDING THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IN ADDITION ALL. AROUND THE FUNDING COMES FROM THE T. O. T. FUNDING THAT COMES FROM. THE IT'S CALLED THE TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX THE CITY'S COLLECT TRANSIT NOT TO OCCUPANCY TAXES AND THEN CITY COUNCILS AND MAYORS WILL CHOOSE TO WEAR THOSE DOLLARS SHOULD. PROBABLY SENTENCE OF THOSE I KNOW AT LEAST IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IN MOST CITIES IN THIS COUNTY. GO TOWARD PROMOTING THE CITY AND TO RESOLVE AND. EVENTS THAT TRACTORS SOME CREDIT CAN FIND. A THEY CAN FUND. THE MOBILE MARKET THEY COULD FIND. CONCERTS THEY CAN FIND. DIFFERENT LOCAL AFFAIRS AND. EVENTS AND SO ALL OF YOUR FUNDING COMES FROM AN ASSESSMENT DISTRICT CORRECT NOT OKAY SO IT IS THREE THAT PRIVATE MECHANISM THAT OUR FUNDING COMES THROUGH VERY INTERESTING PUBLIC PRIVATE THING I GUESS TO GET TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S AUTHORIZED BY LEGISLATION IT IS I'LL DO IT ALL THE OTHER SO THAT AND THAT VISIT. CALIFORNIA AD THAT WE SAW THAT THAT DOES THAT COME OUT OF. WELL WHO FINDS THE CALIFORNIA. SERVICE A CALIFORNIA IS ALSO AN ASSESSMENT DISTRICT. FOR THE DAY SO FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT IS A VARIETY OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE IN THAT ASSESSMENT DISTRICT. SO IT IS BASED ON WHETHER YOUR BUSINESS IS BENEFITING FROM TOURISM. WE DO THERE WHAT'S THE NATURE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FUNDS. BASICALLY IT'S A 3% TO FORTY TAX WHICH HOTELS WHICH OUT OF THAT WE GIVE 29% TO THE CITIES AND THE STATE DOESN'T BELLA CAMPAIGN AND EACH CITY DOES THEIR OWN. THEIR OWN CAMPAIGN COM. OKAY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU VERY INTERESTING THANK YOU GUYS. ONLY THREE. WHAT 3% TO GO THERE. 3% PROCESS 3% TOTAL. THANK YOU I'M SECRETARY I HAD A QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO MEDICAL TOURISM AND IS IT A PARTICULAR SPECIAL SPECIALTY THAT. CALIFORNIA'S GO DOWN. TO VISIT A PHYSICIAN FOR OR IS IT JUST OVERALL GENERAL HEALTH CARE AND. THESE ARE IN INSURANCE POLICIES PRETTY MUCH RECEIVED. ALL BUT I JUST USE EXTRA TO RESUME SO I JUST YOURS AS WELL. BASICALLY IT'S A- DEPENDS ON THE CITY LIKE I LOST A LOT OF DENTISTRY. FRANKLY FOR EXAMPLE HAS AN HMO FOR PEOPLE FROM CALIFORNIA THAT SIDE OF THE BORDER AND JUST PEOPLE WHO DO FREE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF PLASTIC SURGERY ALSO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU WHAT WHAT WHAT YEAH. WE NEED TO GET TO THE AIRPORT. SENATOR WAS VERY POLITE HE PAY MAY I WANT TO ALSO PROMOTION IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOP TO RESUME BUT ALSO THE WHOLE PROCESS AND I WENT OUT TO POINTED OUT SOMETHING THAT WOULD REALLY. HELP TO DEVELOP MORE TOURISM CROSS BORDER TOURISM. I'M THAT'S A DAY AT THE FEDERAL I NINETY FOUR TAX WHEN YOU CROAK WHEN YOU ARRIVE BY BY AIR YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT. TAX BASED ON YOUR YOU CAN WHEN YOU CROSS BY LAND. EVEN DOUG TRAILER BORDERS OR CV. IF YOU HAVE TO GO TO A SECONDARY PROCESS ON IMMIGRATION. AND THAT'S BECAUSE IF YOU'RE DRIVING MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MILES. ENGLAND YOU NEED TO PAY THAT THAT THAT'S THAT IT'S A BIT HARDER FOR THE CUSTOMERS AN ADDITIONAL PROCESS. AND THERE IS NO COMMONALITY UP ON THE BOARD THIS RECENT TAX US. IF YOU ARE HUNDRED MILES IN SEE LAND YOU DON'T PAY THAT THAT HAS SO I THINK. THERE WILL BE A HUGE OPPORTUNITY. TO KEEP DEVELOPMENT IN THE TOURISM THE TRANSPORTER TOURISM. IF WE CAN EXTEND THAT LINE OF WORK DOES THAT TRAVELERS NEED TO PAY THAT THAT THAT SO I CAN BRIEF YOU MORE. ABOUT THAT BUT THAT IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY WILL WELCOME MORE PASSING YEARS MAKE THE PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT. I'M JUST GLAD TO PRIMARY PROCESS WITH IMMIGRATION AND THAT IS TAX. LAW ON THE SIDE OF THE BORDER HE FOUND THE US TAX YEAH. CARRETERA FEDERAL TAX ON ON OUR SIDE OF THE BLOCK HERE RIGHT. IT'S NOT THE SAME IN EACH STATE TEXAS I MENTIONED THIS ALREADY HUNDRED MILES WHERE YOU CAN DRIVE FREELY WITHOUT PAIN THAT THAT'S HEARING CALIFORNIA'S ONLY TWENTY FIVE MILES SO IF YOU GO FOR YOU. IN ORDER OF SAN DIEGO YOU NEED TO. CALL AND DO THE SECONDARY PROCESS WITH C. B. P. AND MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING. WE CAN WORK WITH THEIR LOCAL CONGRESSMAN FROM VARIOUS. HE'S BEEN A REALLY GOOD ADVOCATE FOR HELPING YOU REDUCE PORTER WAIT TIMES HE'S ACTUALLY BEEN PRETTY. RIGHT ON HUGE IN HELPING US WITH ALL OF THAT STUFF WITH. HE LET ME SOMEWHERE IN THE SYSTEM AND ALL WE HAVE TWO PEOPLE ON TONYA ON. EDDIE MAYER HERE RIGHT BUT IN MY **** FROM THIS OFFICE SO. NO THIS GENTLEMAN NOTES. THANK YOU WHICH WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH OUR PANELISTS. WE HAVE A WITH US THE VERY DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR OF ON THE WEST COAST FOR ALMOST. HE'S THE COORDINATOR OF THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO PROJECT THAT HE'S BACK AGAIN HE'S TESTIFIED AT OTHER. COMPANIES HERE IS THAT HE'S HAD HIS TESTIMONY IS ALWAYS VERY INSIGHTFUL SO WE WELCOME HIM BACK OFTEN. WE ALSO HAVE THEIR NEEDS. REEVE THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE UC MEXICO INITIATIVE THAT I PRONOUNCE IT CORRECTLY. GREAT THANK YOU AND THE NEXT PANEL AFTER THIS ONE WOULD BE ON THE HEALTH CARE. UP PART OF TOURISM AND THANK YOU. WHAT IS. THERE A WAY SO AND CERTAINLY IT'S A GREAT HONOR FOR ME TO PARTICIPATE THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO BRING IN TO CONTEXT ROLE OF EDUCATION IN THIS. UP BY NATIONAL IDENTITY THAT WE'RE SEARCHING FOR. AN AND SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT BE S. EXCITING OR AS ADVANCED THE CDC IN THIS CASE THE AT THE HUGE IMPACT THAT TOURISM IS HAVING. ALONG THE BORDER SO IT IS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE I WANTED TO. ALSO REMIND YOU THAT WE'RE ALSO CONNECTED BY THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS ACROSS THE BORDER BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO. THROUGHOUT BUT THERE IS VERY LITTLE. VERY VERY LITTLE EXCHANGE OF FACULTY AND STUDENTS SO LET ME GIVE YOU JUST A BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE THAT I HAVE. BECAUSE AND AGAIN LET ME JUST RE INTRODUCE MYSELF I AM PURPOSE ARE MONDO BASKET ALMOST SELF FROM WHAT CAL STATE LONG BEACH. AND SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH CALIFORNIA MEXICO EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE. AND I HAVE THE TEAM IN MANY LOCATIONS STUDENTS A PACK OF P. TO STUDY IN MEXICO SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX. I ALSO WORK IN THE SEA IS YOUR CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN THE OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS BACK IN THE MID NINETIES. AND IN SIX IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE I WAS IS CO FOUNDER OF THE CAL STATE LONG BEACH KIND OR LATINO STUDIES DEPARTMENT I KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO BE ARRESTED SECOND FIFTY YEARS AGO. BUT I WAS ONE OF THE MAY CHANCE TO THE METER SO WE WERE THE STUDENTS THAT OPENED THE DOORS TO HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES I MEAN THAT ROLE I'M I'M I'M A VERY PROUD ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE BEEN NOW FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS FOLLOWING. OR NOT PROMOTING THIS EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO. I HAVE ALSO BEEN FOLLOWING AND I BELIEVE THAT TODAY'S HEARING IT IDEALLY COINS SITES WEIRD GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM'S INITIATIVES. TO RESTORE BILATERAL COOPERATION BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO. AND THIS HAS TO DO ALSO IN PARTICULAR WITH HIGHER EDUCATION I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE PRESENTATION BY MY COLLEAGUE GOING WHAT THE UC SYSTEM. HASH AND OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR IS PURSUING RE OPENING THE OFFICE IN MEXICO CITY. THAT WAS SHUT DOWN BACK IN THE EARLY TWO. I WAS IN THIS UNDER THE TEN YEAR OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS. BUT THIS INITIATIVE BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS TO PROMOTE NOT ONLY HIGHER EDUCATION BUT ALSO TRADE AND COMMERCE. INNOVATION AND RESEARCH AND CREATES A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO LEAD THE WAY. US POLICY SOME PROGRAMS OF THE SAFER ARE SHAPED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD MEXICO CITY WAS OUR LARGEST. OFFICE IN THE WORLD. AND OF COURSE GIVEN THE DOWNTURN AT THAT POINT HE WAS HE WAS THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED TO CLOSE IT. BUT IN MY OPINION WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO DATE IS THE OPPORTUNITY THE LIVE CIRCUIT AND THE LEADERSHIP THAT THIS COMMITTEE. CAN PROVIDE TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE IN. LONG TERM SET OF HIGHER EDUCATION POLICIES. THAT REFLECTS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO RELATIONSHIP IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. FOR A REGION THAT IS ALREADY ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE IN THE WORLD. HOWEVER IN THE CASE OF THE KELSEY SYSTEM ONE LIKE THE UC MEXICO INITIATIVE AND THIS IS FOR OUR CALL THE WHEEL. GIVING BACK RUNNING TOURISTS WHO WHAT THE UC SYSTEM HESS WITH MEXICO THE YOU IN THE C. ISSUE THE COMPANY'S THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM LACKS A SIMILAR INITIATIVE. AND AFTER THE THREE YEAR BAN ON TRAVEL TO MEXICO BY FORMER CHANCELLOR SEES YOU CHANCELLOR CHARLIE REED THE SYSTEM HAS BARELY RETURN TO ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT. OF THE FORMER IN ROME IN IN THIS YEAR'S YOU MEXICO STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM. I HAVE SHARED THIS PRESENTATION WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE THE SENATORS THAT ARE WITH US AND YOU MAY SEE THAT CHART. IT IS VERY VERY LOW. AND THE IDEA OF COMMON KEEN ON THIS IS TO PROMOTE WHY WE NEED TO EXPAND WHY WE NEED TO IMPROVE. IN PARTICULAR WITHIN THE CSU SYSTEM. BUT ALSO ACROSS CALIFORNIA'S. HIGHER EDUCATION ALL THREE SYSTEMS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THEY HAVE STUDY ABROAD. AND IN THIS CASE THIS YOU YOUR SYSTEM HAS BARELY RETURN TO ABOUT 30% OF THE FORMER IN ROME AND BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHERE I WORKED AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS UP ABOUT. SIXTY FIVE TO SEVENTY STUDENTS SYSTEM WIDE. OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT APPROXIMATELY THREE STUDENTS FOR CAMPUS WELL LET ME TELL YOU AND THIS IS SOME RESEARCH THAT I DID THIS IS UPDATED INFORMATION JUST GOT WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS. WE HAVE NOW IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN ROLE ONLY. EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THIS YEAR ELEVEN. IN THE C. ISSUE MEXICO STARTED A PROGRAM WHICH IS HOUSED AT THE IN THE THEY TAKE THE MONTERREY CAMPUS AND GET IT THOUGH. USED TO BE IN MEXICO CITY AT THE BETTER MANY KINDA. BUT IT IS VERY CONSISTENT AT THIS CONCERNING THAT WE DON'T HAVE A MUCH GREATER AMOUNT OF STUDENTS FROM CALIFORNIA'S KELSEY SYSTEM IN LET ME GO ON TO REFLECT. WHY THIS IS OF GREAT CONCERN THIS YEAR'S YOU HAS GROWN TO MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY STUDENTS TO BECOME THE LARGE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MEXICAN CHICANO LATINO. ENROLLMENT ONE THIRD AND GROWING CLOSE TO BECOME THE MAJORITY WITHIN THIS DECADE IN THE C. ISSUE SYSTEM AND TOPPING MORE THAN 30% CURRENTLY. GIVEN THE GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY THE WORLD AND MEXICO AS THE THIRTEEN LARGE ECONOMY IN THE WORLD THIS ALSO REPRESENTS THE LET THE NURSERY SIGNIFICANT HUMAN RESOURCE. THAT COULD BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMIC FUTURE OF THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO REGION AND THAT ALL CONNECTS WITH HAS BEEN PRESENTED THIS IS DUE TO UNDERSCORE WHY WE NEED TO DO MORE. AND ONE DONE A REALLY THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE SCENE IN THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE DUE TO THE C. ISSUES BAN BUT ALSO DUE TO THE DOWNTURN OF THE ECONOMY AT THAT POINT WHEN THE BAN WENT INTO EFFECT. AND THE FEAR THAT WE HAVE ABOUT SECURITY ABOUT CRIME AT THE NORCAL WAR THAT WE HAVE IN MEXICO BUT I WOULD POINT TO ONE ADDITIONAL PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN THIS USE YOUR SYSTEM. WE DON'T HAVE THE INSTITUTIONAL CULTURE. TO PROMOTE STUDY ABROAD FOR OUR STUDENTS IN MEXICO AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. THERE'S THREE CENTERS THREE CITIES IN SPAIN WHERE EVEN LATINOS EVEN HE CONDOS RATHER TO GO TO STUDY SPANISH AS SOMEBODY WAS TELLING ME EARLIER THIS MORNING THAT. BUT FEEL WAS TELLING ME THAT THAT ONE OF HIS FRIENDS SWINTON'S DINNERS SPANISH IN IN IN IN SPAIN. AND THEN YOU COME BACK SPEAKING IN A RARE HER IS NOT THE CULTURAL CONTEXT IS NOT THE KIND OF SPANISH. THAT WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE IN THE CLASSROOM AS TEACHERS OR IN ANY PROFESSIONAL FEEL. SO NOT WITHSTANDING THIS REALITY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CLOSEST ONE AUDIO AND GIVE IT KNOWN WHO HAVE NOW BOTH ARE I DON'T I DON'T THE LEGISLATURE SPONSOR A AT IT HE- JOINT RESOLUTION AN ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NUMBER ONE FORTY SIX. THEY RECOGNIZE THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO PROJECT THAT I STAB US A CAL STATE LONG BEACH BUT ALSO THE DIRECTED FOR THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BE YOURS TO CONDUCT THE STUDY. IT REPORT CAUGHT ON CALIFORNIA MAKES YOU STUDY BETTER PROGRAMS JUST BE NORMAL IS. MORE THAN TEN YEARS AND I WILL CALL UPON THE COMMITTEE FOR THE SENATORS THAT HERE TO RE VISIT THAT AND TO BRING YOU UP TO DATE. FOR THE CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BUREAU TO UP THE SPEAKERS HOW ARE WE DOING AND NOT ONLY CAL STATE BUT YET THE UC AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE THERE'S GREAT. LESSONS TO BE. LEARNED FROM THAT THAT RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE. AND I USE WHEN IT COME THROUGH BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MORE THAN THE FIVE MINUTES ALLOCATED THE REPORT IS. POINTS TO A LOT OF THE- OBVIOUS. DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES NEED TO BE APPLIED BUT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER. THE WAVE THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THE GOVERNOR IS LEANING. AT THIS POINT IS A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMMITTEE TO EXPAND COLLABORATION WITH CAL FOR COMPETING CALIFORNIA MEXICO'S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IT IS ALSO A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO CONVENE A CONFERENCE THAT COULD DEVELOP JOIN UP I MEAN AND- VENTURES THAT COULD EXPAND THIS ACADEMIC EXCHANGE. AND THEN ALSO THE FACT THAT WHAT WE NEED IS TO DEVELOP GREATER COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE INSTITUTIONS TO EXCHANGE FACULTY AND STUDENTS HAVE FOR THAT I ALSO PROPOSE IN THIS PAPER. THE CONSTABLE BY ONE TO ONE EXCHANGE BETWEEN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU CAN ELIMINATE THE OUT OF STATE TUITION. IF YOU WISH EXCHANGE STUDENT FROM A MEXICAN UNIVERSITY WITH THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION NEITHER ONE HAS TO PAY FOR OUT OF STATE TUITION BUT AGAIN THESE ARE LONG TERM IDEAS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE IN THE PAPER. AND AGAIN I THINK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DAY AND TOO WELL SHARE SOME OF THESE CONCEPTS. AND IDEAS FOR THE AUDIENCE THINK SO MUCH. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU SO MUCH PROFESSOR EDMUNDO VASQUEZ FOR REALLY SETTING UP THE CHALLENGES AND THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE FACING THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AS HE SO ELOQUENTLY SAD WE SHARE THE SAME CHALLENGES BE IT WITHIN THE YOU SEE THE CAL STATE AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT IF IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF OUR FACULTY AND YOU'LL HEAR THIS IN A MOMENT WHEN I GIVE MY PRESENTATION. OUR FACULTY ARE REALLY THE DRIVERS FOR OUR OUR FACULTY EXCHANGES AND BEFORE YOU GET INTO MY TALK ONE THING I WANTED TO SHARE WITH OUR OUR COLLEAGUES FROM VISIT CALIFORNIA AND WHAT NOT IS THROUGH OUR INSTITUTIONS YOU HAVE AN ACCESS AND THE VENUE OF BEING ABLE TO BUILD UP ADDITIONAL TRAVEL OPPORTUNITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE HAKU WHICH IS THE HISPANIC ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO THEY'RE GOING TO BE HERE IN SAN DIEGO. SO IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT THIS BUYING NATIONAL VISIT AND TO SEE HOW WE CAN ENGAGE WITH T. ONE ENSENADA AND OUR OTHER EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS HERE IN. ALONG THE BORDER. AND BUT JUST TO THROW THAT OUT. OKAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE PERSPECTIVE UP UNTIL TWENTY FIFTEEN. ANY KIND OF ACTIVITY THAT WAS TAKING PLACE IN TERMS OF ACADEMIC MOBILITY THIS STUDENT FACULTY STAFF GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO HE WAS PRIMARILY BEING DRIVEN AT WITHIN THE YOU SEE BY OUR FACULTY BY OUR CAMPUSES. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A AGREEMENT SIGNED BETWEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND PRESIDENT OPINION YET SO. THAT IT'S CALLED FOR BESSIE. IT IS BASICALLY A BI NATIONAL AGREEMENT FOR EDUCATION INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY. THAT AGREEMENT CREATED A SYSTEM WHAT I MEAN BILATERAL FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE OF ENGAGEMENT THAT TO THIS DAY IS THE FOUNDING PRINCIPAL OF THE UC MEXICO INITIATIVE. WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS WE ARE FOR EXAMPLE WITHIN THE UC SYSTEM WE STARTED TO TRACK OUR ACADEMIC MOBILITY TO MEXICO AS A SYSTEM THAT'S OUR TEN CAMPUSES ARE NATIONAL LABS AS WELL AS OUR MEDICAL SCHOOLS. WE ROSE WE GAINED 37% INCREASE IN MOBILITY BECAUSE WE FOCUSED ON THIS FOR BESSIE AS OUR PLATFORM. I'M BRINGING THIS UP BECAUSE IT IS AN EXAMPLE AND CALIFORNIA IS NOT THE ONLY ONE I AM SURE THAT CONSUL GENERAL CONSENSUS CAN GIVE YOU EXAMPLES TO OF TEXAS AND WHAT NOT. IT HAS CREATED IT OPEN WIDE THE DOORS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES IT IS THROUGH FIVE S. YOU THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE CAL STATE AS WELL IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO I JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE. THAT THAT TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT WERE THAT KIND OF SUPPORT IS BROUGHT OUT CALIFORNIA CAN BE A LEADER WE ALREADY HAD THIS WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR CALIFORNIA TO EXPLORE. AS I MENTIONED WE DO HAVE CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL TOURISM THIS IS THE BRASS OF A GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT THIS IS OUR WHAT WE PROMOTE AND WHAT WE PUSH THIS IS THE FUTURE THAT WE WANT FOR OUR STUDENTS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS KIND OF BY NATIONAL TRAVEL BE IT HERE AT THE BORDER AS WELL AS FURTHER INLAND MAINLAND FROM BOTH REGIONS IT IS A FOUNDING PRINCIPLE FOR THE TYPE OF FUTURE TALENT. WORKERS AND INDIVIDUALS AND CONTRIBUTORS THAT WE WANT IN OUR SOCIETY. WE HAVE STUDENTS WERE GOING BACK AND FORTH AS YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW TO PURSUE THEIR GRADUATE DEGREES. WE CURRENTLY WILL BE HOSTING IN FEB YOUR I MEAN WELCOME MEAN THIS SOUNDED THIS SEPTEMBER MORE THAN A HUNDRED SIXTY GRADUATE STUDENTS WHO WILL BE COMING INTO THE USER SEES ALL OF THE TEN UC CAMPUSES WE ARE CURRENTLY HERE IN SAN DIEGO AT UC SAN DIEGO HOSTING MORE THAN HUNDRED TEN UNDERGRADUATES FROM MEXICO. WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN A SUMMER RESEARCH INTERNSHIP PROGRAM. WE ALSO ARE HOST STEAM AND SEPTEMBER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF TRIPPING OVER SLOWLY COMING TO GET FAMILIAR WITH CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS THEY WILL BE PRIMARILY VISITING. RIVERSIDE AND UC DAVIS BUT ALL ALONG THE WAY THEY WILL BE STOPPING TO DO VISITS THROUGHOUT GETTING TO MOVE BE BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE WAY OUR AGRICULTURE SYSTEMS ARE INTEGRATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY AND HOW THERE IS THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PRIVATE. AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR. IN ADDITION TO THAT IT'S THESE TYPE OF AGREEMENTS THESE TYPE OF MOBILITY OPPORTUNITIES THAT ALLOW US TO REALLY BE ABLE TO BUILD A PROGRAM. SO BEFORE TWENTY FOURTEEN. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES HATTIE PROGRAM HAD SOME KIND OF ENGAGEMENT WITH MEXICO BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL TWENTY FOURTEEN. THAT WE STARTED TO LOOK WHAT CAN WE DO AS A SYSTEM SO INSTEAD OF DOING IT CAMPUS BY CAMPUS HOW COULD WE LOOK AND BRING TOGETHER ANY GREAT. OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THIS THE SYSTEM AND BE ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN MEXICO TO REALLY ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES. AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER.

THAT WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO BOTH REGIONS. AS I MENTIONED WE DO. IT'S OUR FACULTY ENGAGEMENT THAT THAT REALLY HAS BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL WE DO HAVE THE TRADITIONAL EDUCATION ABROAD PROGRAM. FOR THE YOU SEE IT'S PRIMARILY OR NON INSTEAD OF THE TECH DEMO TODAY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO SPIN IT WE WANT TO STOP JUST LOOKING AT THIS ONE ON ONE RECIPROCAL AND WE WANT TO RETHINK. WHAT ARE THE BEST WAYS OF BEING ABLE TO DO EXCHANGES SPEED VERY SHORT TERM BE IT JUST FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO POTENTIALLY SIX YEARS FOR WHEN A STUDENT IS PROTECT IS PURSUING THEIR GRADUATE DEGREE. IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR TO UP ARE YOU SEEM NEXUS THIS IS THE UC INSTITUTE FOR MEXICO IN THE UNITED STATES IT HAS MADE MORE THAN THIRTY YEAR HISTORY.

WAIT WHAT AS MISTER GORE WELL GORE TO LET HERE STILL ALL THERE YOU ARE WE HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING FLIGHTS AND WHAT FLIGHTS ARE CHOSEN AT AIRPORTS AND OUR OUR MAYOR WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT THE FILIPINO COMMUNITY. THERE WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST FILIPINO COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA HERE LOCALLY IN HERE ESPECIALLY IN. EITHER AND THE QUESTION AS FLIGHTS TO MANILA OR THE PHILIPPINES WHY ISN'T THAT SOMETHING THAT HAS HAS FIFTY ONE AIRPORT LOOKED AT THAT AS A POTENTIAL ROUTE. AND IS THAT SOMETHING IS POSSIBLE. I'M GOING TO BE. SO MID SEPTEMBER THERE'S A BIG CONFERENCE WERE AIRLINES AND AIRPORTS MEET TO SCHOOLS ROUTES IN THIS TRIAL YEAH I'M GOING TO BE PART OF THAT THE WHOLE FOCUS OF GROUP BY REPORTER THE PACIFIC CALL WILL BE ON THE CBS ON THESE TRANS BORDER CROSSING WE'RE MEETING WITH TOP PHILIPPINE AIRLINES SOMEONE AROUND THIRTEEN OTHER CARRIERS TO TRY TO ATTRACT MORE WILL COMPETE WOULD SEND THE WRONG ON THAT BUT I CAN. THE GOALIES ANYWAY BRING MORE MORE AIR SERVICE INTO THE INTO THE REGION SAW HOPE I COME I COME REVIEWED SEE THIS ALARM PROCESS AND SOMETHING REMARKABLE THAT I WANT TO MENTION THE QUANTITY OR POOR WILLIAM BEST CLOSE TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. TO DEVELOP A NEW FACILITY WHICH WILL ALLOW INTERNATIONAL THE INBOUND PASS ON YOURS TO CROSS THE WRIGLEY THROUGH THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT ENTERING INTO MEXICAN VICE SERVER SO THAT WILL WE CONVERT A TRULY BY NATIONAL FACILITY CV X. ON THE ONE OR- NOT SINCE WHAT IS HERE. WITH YOUR WHERE DOES THE CHECK I YOU KNOW MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION MATTERED BETTER HAD YOU KNOW IN PRIVATE BUT I WAS WONDERING WHAT ARE THEIR KIND OF TENSIONS BUT ALSO SYNERGIES WITH SAN DIEGO AIRPORT AND THE- YOU KNOW WITH WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT LOOKED UPON AS A AS A NEGATIVE IS A POSITIVE WITH REGARDS TO SENIOR PROM TENSIONS. WELL I WOULDN'T SAY THAT DO AWFUL SAID WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER WE'RE ABOUT 2% OF PROJECT WORK WE CAN FACILITATE. THAT TRANSFER OF PASSENGERS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND. THE ONE I DON'T WANT WON'T HAVE FLIGHTS INTO THE US AND HE WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT THAT SENT VIA WILL GET. FLY SEEM TO MEXICO JUST BECAUSE THE TAXATION PROCESS ON AND IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLANE DOMESTIC THINGS VERSUS INTERNATIONAL SO WE'RE WORKING. WITH THEM NINETEEN AT THE BEGINNING THAT'S A WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE QUAN ASK PEOPLE WHEN WE LEARN CV X. THEY EXPECT THAT WE WILL STEAL. PASSENGERS GETTING INTO THE ONE AND THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE. THESE WERE WORKING AND COLLABORATE TOGETHER WOULD SEND THE OR TO COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER NETWORK. AND THE YOU KNOW WITH THE WORK AND FOR WELL OVER TWENTY YEARS TO SIDE A NEW AIRPORT. IN SAN DIEGO BUT WE WERE IN COMPETITION WITH. SOME MILITARY AIRFIELDS OR OF STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE TO THE COUNTRY AND THEY TAKE UP A LOT OF. REAL ESTATE IN OUR COUNTY. THAT INCLUDES CAMP PENDLETON NORTH ISLAND AND MIRAMAR RIGHT SO YOU SO RIGHT NOW SO WHEN YOU WE LOOK AT THE AIR TRAVEL WE'VE LOOKED AT. WE HAVE BROWN FIELD WHICH IS AN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT HERE NO TIME MESA BUT IT HAS LIMITATIONS BASED ON THE MOUNTAIN RANGE AND SO THE GEOGRAPHY. IN SENEGAL MAKES IT VERY HARD TO CITE AN AIRPORT. WHICH MEANS THE RIGHT NOW SAN DIEGO IS THE BUSIEST ONE RUNWAY AIRPORT IN THE NATION. AND SO THE WHOLE HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE QUANAH WORKS OUT VERY WELL FOR US BECAUSE IT GIVES MORE OPTIONS TO TRAVELERS. TO TRAVEL FROM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WITH DESTINATIONS I CONNECT WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. IN AREAS THAT SENDING WHAT DOES NOT PROVIDE SO THIS WHAT SENEGAL HAS. IN AN OPTIONS DEPENDS ON WHAT THE WANNA HAS SO IT'S BEEN ACTUAL RELATIONSHIP THAT'S WORKED VERY WELL FOR OUR REGION. AND SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND.

MANUALS BELIEVE HAPPENING THIS WEEKEND I MESSED UP MY TOOTH WENT TO THE DENTIST NOW THEN SHARON STONE COVER IT I GOT A CO PAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO. AND. SORRY TO HEAR THAT. I ALSO WENT TO THE DENTIST. HE WAS PRETTY COOL GREAT AT HEALTH AND WELLNESS. THIS IS THE HOTEL FOR NOW. IN THIS PRESENTATION A. I WONDER TOO TO SHOW YOU THE CRAWL. ALL THE MEDICAL TOURISM IN OUR STATE AND HOW THE PUBLIC POLICY. HOUSE COLLABORATE TO IT LAST YEAR. THE SAFETY AND THE TRUST OF A REGION. SO THE NEXT SORT. YOU CAN SEE ON THE MAP. WE SHOW YOU THE SOULS BY STATE. A WERE MAINLY IN MEDICAL AT THE STORES WE RECEIVE IS HIGH THE PERSON THAT SHE'S COMING FROM CALIFORNIA 49% AND THEN TWENTY THE MOTLEY OPERATION OF A DOG BE STORY AND MEDICAL TOURISM IN BAJA CALIFORNIA IS THAT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND- DOLLARS. AND THE OTHER IS TO THE STICK THEM MOSTLY 40% OF THE ABC DOLLARS IS PANIC AND ABOUT A 10% IS IT A CLASSIC AND THE AND THE 10% OF CANADIAN AS WELL. ONE TWENTY SIXTEEN TWO POINT FOUR MILLION OF PATIENT AND COMPANION. A B. C. THE BAJA CALIFORNIA. THANKS FOR THAT OFF THE STATUS THEY INCOME IS EIGHT EIGHT HUNDRED AND MERELY ON A DOLLAR FOR THE SET FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT. ON TWENTY EIGHTEEN. EIGHTEEN WE HAVE. A INCOME FOR ONE THOUSAND MILLION OF DOLLAR. ALSO I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO MENTION THAT ON THIS YEAR WE ARE OUR SECOND PLACE IN MEDICAL TERMS IN THE GLOBAL. I'M VERY PROUD TO. TO MENTION BAJA CALIFORNIA IS THE FIRST AT THE PIONEER. STATE IN MEXICO WITHOUT PUBLIC POLICY. FOR HELP TOWARDS THE BOTTOM. WHICH NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO PROVIDE SAFETY AND PROTECTION FOR THE PATIENT AND THE COMPANION. AT THE END OF THE SEVENTH EDITION WE WILL LIKE TO ENCOURAGE TO START BY NATIONAL PROP FOR. TO ALLOW OR DOCTORS FOR MEXICO AND THE US HAVE ACCESS FOR THE PATIENT MEDICAL RECORD. UNDER THE MOST HISTORICALLY INTERNATIONAL PROTOCOLS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE PROPER MEDICAL CARE IN FOLLOW UP. IN BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. THIS IS FOR WARRANTY THAT PATIENT TRUST AND SAFETY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. HELLO THANKS FOR THE INVITATION I AM VERY PROUD AND HONORED TO REPRESENT AND USE IT TO MEDICAL PLAZA IN THE NAME OF ABOUT A FAMILY. AND ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH PART OF JOINING PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND PUBLIC EFFORTS TO DO THESE ARE REALITY. SO IF CAN YOU PUT THE PRESENTATION PLEASE I'M GONNA TAKE JUST TWO MINUTES. HM I HAVE BEEN IN THIS INDUSTRY AROUND THREE YEARS REALLY UNDERSTANDING HOW TO CREATE A SERVICE THAT IS NOT BILINGUAL BUT BY CULTURE OUT. IT WE REALLY DO UNDERSTAND THINGS IN A DIFFERENT WAY EVEN IF WE SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE SO A ONE THING THAT A WITH THESE VERY PROFOUNDLY IT'S A STUDY IN THE STATES. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHICH ONES WERE THE PILLARS TO CREATE THIS BUSINESS. AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES IS REALLY INTEGRATING THE SERVICE AMONG THREE SOME AND MEDICAL. WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THREE SOME WE KNOW IT'S ADVENTURES. I DON'T HAVE DON'T WORRY NO WORRY SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TO RESUME ITS ADVENTURE WHEN YOU TOOK OUT A TALK ABOUT MEDICAL. A PEOPLE FEEL VULNERABLE SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE VERY OPPOSITE TORCHED WORDS TO PUT TOGETHER. SO THE PEELER SAID WE FIND OUT THAT WERE VERY IMPORTANT IS THAT THE PATIENTS IN THE STATES REALLY WANT TO HAVE AN INTEGRATED SERVICE SOMEBODY THAT FULLY ADVOCATES FOR THEM AND RESPOND FOR THEM. RIGHT NOW A SOME COMPANIES AS SEEMS ARE DOING AMAZINGLY BECAUSE THEY INTEGRATE SERVICES BUT IT'S NOT THE REALITY OF HOW THIS IS HAPPENING IN MEXICO. SO ONE THING THAT WE NEED TO CREATE IS REALLY THE QUALITY THAT YOU EXPECT US AT AM AMERICAN PATIENT. BUT WITH THE- THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS THAT WE ARE HEARING THE BORDER TO HAVE INSURANCE IN A DIFFERENT COST A SEEMS IS DOING. AND THE QUALITY OF SERVICE SO I THINK THAT THE SIX OF AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY THE BUILDING OFF OF MEDICAL PLAZA IT'S TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND METERS OF DIFFERENT MEDICAL SPECIALITIES. WITH HOTEL THAT IT'S ALREADY OPEN IT WITH COMMERCIAL CENTERS FOR A FIVE HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED METERS FROM THE BORDER. SO WE ARE REALLY LOOKING UP TO ANOTHER FACILITY OF THE QUALITY OF SEEMS. AND REALLY TRYING TO DO THINGS WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN A DIFFERENT AND VERY PROFESSIONAL WAY TO HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE SCENE THE STREET BECAUSE IT'S NEW. IT'S NOT MATURE AND THERE'S A LOT OF A OPPORTUNITIES. FOR ALL OF US TO WORK IN THESE TWO GUYS THANK YOU. THANKS ONLY ONE APOLOGIZE WE WANT TO WE WENT OVER SIGNIFICANTLY OVER ON TIME BUT WE GOT THROUGH IT THANK YOU TO EVERYONE THAT PARTICIPATED AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. AND I JUST WANTED TO IF ANYBODY DIDN'T HAVE IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS WE CAN OFFER THEM NOW. AND IF ANYBODY IN THE PUBLIC LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT ALSO IF ANYBODY WANTS TO COME FORWARD TO MAKE A COMMENT SIR JUST COME UP TO THE MIKE AND TO SHARE. GIVE US MAYBE A MINUTE COMMON IF YOU COULD YES THERE WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AS A NATIVE OF THE ONE I MEAN WE'VE SEEN OUR FAIR SHARE OF. BAD PUBLICITY WE STILL SEE IT BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS I MEAN YOU HEAR ABOUT US KNOW YOUR NAME SO SORRY A DOCTOR ARIEL ORTIZ I'M ALSO SURGEON. A COLLEAGUE OF THE OF ALL OF US MY FRIENDS HERE I HAVE A WEIGHT LOSS SURGERY CENTER I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS FOR TWENTY YEARS MOSTLY DOING A COUPLE THOUSAND SURGERIES PER YEAR. ON US AND CANADIAN PATIENTS TRAVELING TO MEXICO SO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE'RE STILL OFFERING HIGH QUALITY SERVICE IN CERTAIN AREAS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN LIKE I WAS SAYING IS THAT THAT LESS THAN IDEAL PUBLICITY ONCE IN AWHILE WHEN THINGS DON'T GO AS WELL. AND SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT THAT I WANT TO REFER TO THE DOCTOR I DON'T KNOW DOING IT BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING A LITTLE BIT TOGETHER ON CREATING THIS CULTURE OF ACCREDITATION IN MEXICO THE ONLY WAY. YOU CAN GUARANTEE A HIGH QUALITY HEALTH CARE SERVICES NOT BY PATTING YOURSELF ON THE BACK IN YOUR ONLINE ADVERTISING BUT BY ACTUALLY GETTING A THIRD PARTY ACCREDITATION WHICH IS. RESPECTED AROUND THE WORLD SUCH LIKE JOIN COMMISSION INTERNATIONAL. AND BECAUSE IT'S A TRAVELING PATIENT NOW YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS CERTAIN ADDITIONAL ISSUES BECAUSE THE PATIENT IS ACTUALLY TRAVELING YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM SAFE YOU WANT TO KEEP. THEIR FAMILY MEMBER SAFE SO I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A NEW ACCREDITATION THAT JUST CAME ON ON BOARD WHICH IS THE GLOBAL HEALTH CARE ACCREDITATION THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON DOCTOR LETTING IT SO MAYBE HE COULD. COMMENT ON THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE OKAY WELL THANK YOU WRAP UP NOW MATT MADAM. YES PLEASE. AT YES GO AHEAD. ALL SHE'S KIND OF I JUST WANNA MAKE A QUICK COMMENT AND RECOGNIZE A PROFESSOR OF US. I'M GONNA TALK MY DAUGHTER'S IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS DEPARTMENT SPECIALIZING IN SPANISH. AND SHE CHOSE TO GO TO SPAIN BUT THEIR FOR US IT WAS A PERSONAL DECISION BECAUSE WE HAVE FRIENDS THERE. BUT I'M GONNA ASK FOR ONE WHEN I GET HOME ABOUT IF MEXICO WAS PROMOTED AT ALL WITHIN HER DEPARTMENT AND- I'LL GIVE THAT INFORMATION BACK TO THE CENTER AWAY SO THAT WE CAN KEEP AN EYE ON. WHAT'S GOING ON THERE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANK YOU. HI I'M MY NAME IS REBECCA BY YEAH LET ME GUESS I'M SIXTY THREE YEARS OLD AND I'VE LIVED IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY MY WHOLE LIFE. THE LAST THIRTY SEVEN YEARS AND THE SOUTH BAY AND I THANK YOU FOR THIS PRESENTATION IT WAS VERY INFORMATIONAL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE. EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN TERMS OF TOURISM BAT ONE OF MY A. CONCERNS WHETHER IT'S TOURISM. OR IS ACTUALLY. A RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA IT WAS INTERESTING I THINK THAT MISS NEWTON MENTIONED THAT AND ONE OF THE- SURVEYS THAT WAS MENTIONED ABOUT CALIFORNIA. THE IMAGE OF CALIFORNIA BEING A FACTOR RATED IN TERMS OF WHETHER TOURISTS COME HERE. AND FROM THE TIME I WAS LITTLE I'VE TRAVELED. ACROSS THE BORDER IN TERMS OF VISITING FAMILY IN ITS OUTSIDE IN SIN NADA AND- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS SPECIALLY I'D LIKE TO DIRECT TO OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS. I'M IS THE ISSUE OF SECURITY. NOT ONLY IN MEXICO IN TERMS OF THE BORDER. I'LL I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT LIVE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF MEXICO AND THAT IS A REAL CONCERN THE SAFETY I THE CRIME AND CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF MY HUSBAND AND I TRAVEL CROSS COUNTRY THIS SUMMER. AND HONESTLY I ONE OF THE IMAGES OF CALIFORNIA IS WE ARE NOT A LAW AND ORDER STATE. AND I THINK. WE NEED TO PUT. ACTION IN TERMS OF HAVING OUR STATE BE A STATE THAT PROTECTS THE PEOPLE THAT EITHER COME HERE AS VISITORS OR THAT LIVE HERE SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE FOR THIRTY SEVEN YEARS IN THE SOUTH BAY WE'VE HAD THREE VEHICLES STARTING LINE AND LET ME JUST FINISH PLEASE YEAH BUT I IT'S A ONE MINUTE AND I'VE ALREADY GIVEN YOU TODAY OKAY SO IF YOU COULD JUST THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND I WOULD JUST WANNA. BOB FINISH UP BY YOU KNOW THANK YOU EVERYBODY AND AS- I'M WORKING ON TWO BILLS THAT WILL ONE WILL CREATE A CALIFORNIA MEXICO COMMISSION THE IDEA IS TO. GET A CITIZENS COMMISSION INVOLVED AND RESOLVING SOME OF THE- OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE SHARE IN AND REALIZING AND ALSO COMING UP WITH. A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THESE THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONNECT ON. ALSO THAT'S SP FIVE FIVE EIGHT AND I'M ALSO PROPOSING. ESTABLISHING A CALIFORNIA OFFICE IN MEXICO IT'S NOT. SPECIFIC TO ANY REGION BUT THE IDEA WOULD BE TO ESTABLISH AN OFFICE TO ASSIST TRAVELLERS PEOPLE IN EDUCATION PEOPLE IN BUSINESS. TO BUSINESS WITH MEXICO HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH. THE MEXICAN SYSTEM AND THOSE THOSE ISSUES WE HOPE WILL WILL BRING US CLOSER TO MEXICO ONE AND- I THINK I JUST WANNA COURAGE PEOPLE COMMUNITY TO CONTINUE TO CALL MY OFFICE CONTINUE TO CALL US COMMUNICATE WITH US ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO TO BETTER SERVE YOU AND HOW WE WILL WE CAN ACT. TO A FURTHER THIS DIALOGUE THAT WE'VE STARTED HERE TODAY AND THAT IT'S BEEN AN ONGOING DIALOGUE. STREET YOU KNOW SINCE WE STARTED THIS COMMITTEE SO A LOT HAS HAPPENED AND WE HAVE A LOT TO CELEBRATE BUT THERE'S ALWAYS MORE WORK TO BE DONE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DOWN THAT PATH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND EVERYBODY HAVE A NICE DAY
