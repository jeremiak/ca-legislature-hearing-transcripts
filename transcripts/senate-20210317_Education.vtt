SOMEONE FOCUS BECAUSE THEY'VE

NEVER BEEN IN A SCHOOL SETTING.

00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:53.618
ON THE CONTRARY WE HAVE

00:30:53.685 --> 00:30:54.519
STUDENTS SITTING NEXT TO THEM

DISPARITIES THAT WE WITNESS IN

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:09.867
OUR STUDENTS THEY'RE NOT ONLY

00:31:09.934 --> 00:31:11.936
ACADEMIC IMMEASURABLE. BUT YOU

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:13.338
COULD ALSO PHYSICALLY AND

00:31:13.404 --> 00:31:15.573
VISIBLY SEE. AS IT PERTAINS TO

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.642
STUDENTS CONFIDENCE AND

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:19.244
PARTICIPATION IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.012
THE COSBY NINETY PANDEMIC HAS

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:22.046
GREATLY AFFECTED ALL OF OUR

00:31:22.113 --> 00:31:23.982
LIVES AMONG THOSE IMPACTED THE

00:31:24.048 --> 00:31:26.751
MOST. HAVE BEEN OUR STUDENTS.

00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:27.885
AND NOW MORE THAN EVER WE MUST

00:31:27.952 --> 00:31:29.220
SUPPORT OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS

00:31:29.287 --> 00:31:30.421

SO THAT THEY ARE SOCIALLY AND

00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:36.261
ACADEMICALLY PREPARED FOR A

00:31:36.327 --> 00:31:38.229
LIFETIME OF SUCCESS. STUDENTS

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:39.797
WHO DO NOT ATTEND KINDERGARTEN

00:31:39.864 --> 00:31:42.433
ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY IN FIRST

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.402
GRADE. AND BECAUSE OF THAT OUR

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:47.171
TEACHERS AND PARENTS AS WELL.

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:48.640
THE TEACHERS ARE SPENDING MORE

00:31:48.706 --> 00:31:50.908
TIME TRYING TO TEACH THEM THE

00:31:50.975 --> 00:31:51.809
FOUNDATIONAL MATERIALS AND

00:31:51.876 --> 00:31:54.412
SKILLS THAT THEIR PEERS HAVE

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:54.846
ALREADY MASTERED IN

00:31:54.912 --> 00:31:56.881
KINDERGARTEN. ADDITIONALLY OUR

00:31:56.948 --> 00:31:59.117
TEACHERS ARE STRUGGLING JUST TO

00:31:59.183 --> 00:32:00.018
FIND WAYS TO SUPPORT THOSE

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:02.353
STUDENTS AND CONFINING-

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.355
CHALLENGING TRYING TO CATCH

00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:06.291
THEM UP. WHEN THEY HAVEN'T BEEN

00:32:06.357 --> 00:32:08.459
TO SCHOOL WE MUST INVEST IN

00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:10.094
EARLY EDUCATION TO HELP OLDER

00:32:10.161 --> 00:32:12.096
STUDENTS AND TEACHERS SO OUR

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:13.765
STUDENTS CONTINUE TO LEARN AT

00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:16.434
GRADE LEVEL STANDARDS AND DON'T

00:32:16.501 --> 00:32:18.102
FALL FURTHER BEHIND WHICH

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:19.937
CAUSES A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN

00:32:20.004 --> 00:32:21.773
LATER YEARS. I ALSO WANT TO

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:23.308
EMPHASIZE WHY THIS BILL IS EVEN

00:32:23.374 --> 00:32:26.744

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:23.013
SCHOOL THEIR CHILDREN IN IN

00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:24.648
PUBLIC SCHOOL. THERE WILL NOT

00:51:24.714 --> 00:51:26.783
BE ACCEPTED INTO FIRST GRADE

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:29.419
UNLESS THEY HAVE THAT THAT- CAN

00:51:29.486 --> 00:51:31.221
REGARDING YOUR BEFORE ENTERING

00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:34.124
A PUBLIC SCHOOL. OKAY THE

00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:37.160
REASON I ASK IS IF. WE ALL KNOW

00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:38.829
DEVELOPMENTALLY CHILDREN VERY

00:51:38.895 --> 00:51:40.897
QUITE DISTINCTLY BETWEEN BIRTH

00:51:40.964 --> 00:51:42.199
AND FIVE YEARS THOSE ARE

00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:46.269
INCREDIBLY- IMPACTFUL YEARS.

00:51:46.336 --> 00:51:48.205
AND I AM COMPLETELY AWARE AND

00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:50.474
COMPLETELY- ENDORSED THE NOTION

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:53.477
OF EDUCATION- IN THOSE FIVE

00:51:53.543 --> 00:51:55.712
YEARS AS BEING PIVOTAL FOR AT

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:56.546
THE PROPER SUCCESS FOR KIDS

00:51:56.613 --> 00:51:59.115
LATER ON BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND

00:51:59.182 --> 00:52:00.884
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILD.

00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:05.422
AND GIVING PARENTS THE OPTION

00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:08.792
AND WHETHER OR NOT- FORMALES

00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:11.194
KINDERGARTEN IS THE RIGHT PLACE

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:13.096
FOR THEIR FIVE YEAR OLD OR

00:52:13.163 --> 00:52:15.599
VERSUS A DIFFERENT MODEL OF

00:52:15.665 --> 00:52:18.902
SCHOOLING- THAT IS AVAILABLE TO

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:25.242
THEM. SO. MY CONCERN IS THAT IF

00:52:25.308 --> 00:52:26.943
A PARENT DOES NOT FEEL THAT

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:30.914
THEIR CHILD IS- MATURITY

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:32.282
EMOTIONALLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:33.884
PHYSICALLY TO ATTEND- V.

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.719
MANDATED TO ATTEND AT A SCHOOL

00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:39.022
IN CALIFORNIA- WE ARE ONE

00:52:39.089 --> 00:52:41.825
TAKING AWAY THE OPERATIVE OF

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:45.128
APPARENT MAKING THAT CHOICE AND

00:52:45.195 --> 00:52:47.998
NUMBER TWO- I'M CONCERNED THAT

00:52:48.064 --> 00:52:51.034
THE CHILD'S DEVELOPMENTAL-

00:52:51.101 --> 00:52:52.936
LEVEL IS. IS NOT BEING

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:54.604
CONSIDERED IN THIS BILL- YOUR

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:57.707
THOUGHTS ON THAT. THIS WILL

00:52:57.774 --> 00:52:59.776
JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:02.546
BILL DOES GIVE PARENTS OPTIONS.

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:03.914
THEY HAVE THE OPTION TO ENROLL

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:05.982
THE CHILD IN KINDERGARTEN BUT

00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:07.884
THEY ALSO HAVE THE OPTION TO

00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:09.686
TAKE THE HOME SCHOOL OPTION

00:53:09.753 --> 00:53:11.788
THAT WE'D LIKE YOU DID FOR YOUR

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:13.390
OWN CHILDREN AND THEY HAVE THE

00:53:13.456 --> 00:53:15.358
OPTION TO. ENTER A PRIVATE

00:53:15.425 --> 00:53:17.727
SCHOOL AS WELL SO AS LONG AS

00:53:17.794 --> 00:53:20.363
THERE IS SOME TYPE OF EDUCATION

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:21.398
PRIOR TO COMING INTO THE FIRST

00:53:21.464 --> 00:53:23.199
GRADE THOSE ARE THE OPTIONS

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:24.401
PARENTS HOUSE SO IT'S NOT

00:53:24.467 --> 00:53:25.835
NECESSARILY MANDATING THAT THEY

00:53:25.902 --> 00:53:29.105
GO TO PBLIC SCHOOL. THEY'RE

00:53:29.172 --> 00:53:29.739
GIVEN THE HOME SCHOOL OPTION AS

00:53:29.806 --> 00:53:33.376
WELL. OKAY SO JUST WANNA MAKE

00:53:33.443 --> 00:53:35.478
SURE YOU'RE NOT MANDATING SO

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:37.247
PARENTS OR CAREGIVERS WILL NOT

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:40.016
BE PENALIZED FOR NOT HAVING A

00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:42.586
FORMAL. SCHOOL OPTION FOR THEIR

00:53:42.652 --> 00:53:45.655
CHILDREN. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:47.023
FOR MORE ON THE HOME SCHOOL

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:50.126
OPTION IT BEARS SOME GUIDELINES

00:53:50.193 --> 00:53:51.795
FOR HOME SCHOOLING STILL YOU

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:53.730
WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE PROOF TO

00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:55.031
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT

00:53:55.098 --> 00:53:57.067
THEY'VE ATTENDED AND PICK YOUR

00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:59.469
PRIOR TO COMING TO FIRST GRADE-

00:53:59.536 --> 00:54:01.938
IN A WAY OF AFFIDAVIT SEOUL.

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:04.674
FORMAL MEANS IT HAS TO BE SOME

00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:07.177
KIND OF CURRICULUM THAT IS THAT

00:54:07.243 --> 00:54:11.414
IS FORMAL YES OKAY- I'M IN AND

00:54:11.481 --> 00:54:12.716
THAT'S THE OTHER THAT'S THE

00:54:12.782 --> 00:54:13.850
OTHER CONCERN THAT I'M GONNA

00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:16.586
HAVE TO BRING UP IS- THE CURE

00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:18.622
HIM THERE ARE PHILOSOPHIES

00:54:18.688 --> 00:54:20.156
WHERE THEY FEEL THAT CHILDREN

00:54:20.223 --> 00:54:21.691
UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE TO HAVE

00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:25.428
THE FREEDOM. TO NOT BEING A

00:54:25.495 --> 00:54:26.730
FORMALIZED STRUCTURED

00:54:26.796 --> 00:54:27.964
ENVIRONMENT THAT HAVE THE

00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:30.233
FREEDOM TO LEARN DIFFERENT

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.068
SUBJECTS AND DIFFERENT MANNER

00:54:32.135 --> 00:54:33.937
SO I AM I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED

00:54:34.004 --> 00:54:35.939
ABOUT THAT THE END ON ON THAT

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:37.340

00:54:44.914 --> 00:54:47.751
TAKING THE PARODIC OF APPARENT

00:54:47.817 --> 00:54:50.220
MAKING A CHOICE BUT MANDATING

OR HAVING THE STATE TELEPRINTER

00:54:52.822 --> 00:54:54.124
THIS IS WHEN WE THINK YOUR

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:59.029
CHILD SHOULD BELONG. IN A

00:54:59.095 --> 00:55:00.997

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:54.998
FEEL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO

00:58:55.064 --> 00:58:56.299
THAT IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WE

IN BRINGING THEIR KIDS TO

00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:18.888

SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN INTERVENE

00:59:25.261 --> 00:59:27.764
AND OFFER SUPPORT TO THESE

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:28.865
PARENTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING. HI

BOGUE CENTER DOLLY THANK YOU

00:59:34.337 --> 00:59:35.705
MADAM CHAIR- JUST QUESTION

00:59:35.772 --> 00:59:37.407
AUTHORED BY SO LOOK WE'RE

00:59:37.473 --> 00:59:38.708
TALKING ABOUT. WHAT I

00:59:38.775 --> 00:59:40.243
UNDERSTOOD ABOUT 10% OF THE

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:42.245
POPULATION IS 90% ARE ALREADY

00:59:42.312 --> 00:59:45.448
DOING IT. SENATE 10% I HEARD

00:59:45.515 --> 00:59:46.849
YOU SAY EARLIER ANOTHER

00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:49.719
QUESTIONS WAS THAT. YOU CAN'T

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:52.488
ENTER KINDERGARTEN WITHOUT.

00:59:52.555 --> 00:59:54.190
GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS SO

00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:55.858
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SOMEBODY

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:57.894
JUST CHOSE NOT TO DO IT. AND

00:59:57.961 --> 00:59:59.996
NOW THEIR CHILD IS THERE AT SIX

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:01.564
YEARS OLD AND HASN'T HAD THIS

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:06.602
COURSE. I THINK I BELIEVE YOU

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:10.840
STATED. THAT- I'M SORRY. IF

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:12.275
THEY COME TO THE SCHOOL

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:14.077
DISTRICT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY US

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:15.445
IF THEY COME TO SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:17.113
YOU KNOW AND THEY HAVE NOT HAD

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.748
KINDERGARTEN THEY WILL BE

01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:20.483
REQUIRED TO ATTEND KINDERGARTEN

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:22.218
AND YOU STATED YOU KNOW A CHILD

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:25.054
BEING SIX I BELIEVE RIGHT NOW

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:27.490
40% OF STUDENTS ARE SIX YEARS

01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:29.058
OLD THAT INTER CANDOR SO IT'S

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:30.760
SOMETHING THAT ALREADY HAPPENS

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:32.095
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:33.229
UNUSUAL FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.531
TO HAVE A- SIX YEAR OLD IN

01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:38.668
KINDERGARTEN. SO WHAT THE

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.371
QUESTION I ASKED IS. IF THIS IS

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:43.306
GONNA BE MANDATORY AND IF AND

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:45.174
IF THEY DON'T DO THE HOMES PART

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:48.011
OF IT THEY DON'T DO. THEY DON'T

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:50.980
COMPLETE THE TASK SAY THEY JUST

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:54.751
pEXPERIENCE I GUESS I SHOULD SAY

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:56.819
WITH PARENTS WHO ARE SINGLE

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:59.655
PARENTS WHO ARE. NOT CONNECTED

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:01.758
TO IT THERE THERE'S THEY'RE NOT

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:04.594
CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM I GUESS

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:05.762
I SHOULD SAY AND THEY MAY JUST

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:07.697
NOT DO IT AT ALL DOES NOT EVEN

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:09.332
KNOW ABOUT AND THEY MOVE AROUND

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:11.134
AND THEY'RE HARD TO TRACK AND

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.201
ALL THE SUDDEN THEY SHOW UP AT

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:13.302
KINDERGARTEN AND THEY HAVEN'T

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:14.237
DONE ANY OF THIS STUFF AND

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:16.806
THEY'RE AT THE AGE TO GOING TO

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:17.707
GET ARE SIX YEARS OLD. WHAT

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:20.676
HAPPENS AT THAT POINT. IT IS

01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:21.778
MANDATORY THEY DON'T HAVE THAT

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:23.246
PRE CLASS THEY CAN'T CAN THEY

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:24.280
GET IN OR THEY CAN'T GET AND

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:25.615
THAT'S THAT'S WHEN THEY CAN GET

01:01:25.681 --> 01:01:26.716
IN BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:28.051
COMPLETE A FULL YEAR OF

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:30.319
KINDERGARTEN IN ORDER TO. TO BE

01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:32.622
PROMOTED TO FIRST GRADE SO WHEN

01:01:32.688 --> 01:01:34.657
THEY COME AND THEY WOULD HAVE

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:35.858
TO COMPLETE THAT ONE YEAR. AND

01:01:35.925 --> 01:01:37.927
I YOU KNOW AND TO SHARE- AND I

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:39.328
APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN BUT YOU

STUDENTS MOVING AROUND. EVEN

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:47.870
IN. MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:49.539
SCHOOL THAT'S A SCENARIO THAT

01:01:49.605 --> 01:01:51.974
HAPPENS THROUGHOUT OUR SCHOOL-

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:54.377
OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HOWEVER.

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:55.545
IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SIX

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:57.280
YEAR OLD. THEY WOULD STILL HAVE

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:58.314
TO COMPLETE THAT FIRST YEAR OF

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:00.116
KINDERGARTEN BEFORE BEING

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:03.653
PROMOTED TO FIRST GRADE. OKAY

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:05.888
MAYBE I'M THIS IS MY FIRST.

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.156
YEAR ON THIS COMMITTEE AND I

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:09.459
I'M NOT THE EXPERT ON. WHAT

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:10.760
AGES KIDS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:12.028
WHERE BUT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:14.230
YOU WOULD BE SEVEN YEARS OLD

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:15.598
WHEN YOU GOING TO FIRST GRADE.

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:17.567
YES LET ME TRY AND HELP SO IN

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:19.836
CALIFORNIA SIX YEARS OLD IT IS

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:21.304
COMPULSORY THAT YOU HAVE TO

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:22.738
SEND YOUR CHILD TO SCHOOL. I

01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:24.440
THINK WHAT YOU'RE ASKING CENTER

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:25.341
AT ALL YOU'RE JUST ABOUT GOT

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:27.276
THERE WAS IF YOU DON'T SEND

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:29.645
YOUR CHILD. TO KINDERGARTEN AT

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:30.880
FIVE AND YOU SEND THEM TO

01:02:30.947 --> 01:02:33.816
SCHOOL AT SIX. YES I SAID RUBIO

01:02:33.883 --> 01:02:35.418
LET ME KNOW IF I'M WRONG. THEY

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:37.153
WOULD START KINDERGARTEN AT SIX

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.055
YEARS OLD AND THEN THEY WOULD

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:40.857
START. FIRST GRADE AT SEVEN

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:43.192
YEARS OLD CORRECT. SO

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:44.794
TECHNICALLY I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:46.696
ASKING THEY COULD BE A YEAR.

01:02:46.762 --> 01:02:50.700
OLDER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:51.767
CHILDREN IN THE CLASSROOM. IT

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:53.769
ECONOMIC. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU

01:02:53.836 --> 01:02:54.604

OUR 4% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE. IN

01:02:57.773 --> 01:02:59.709
THAT SCENARIO THAT THE JUSTICE

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:01.177
SO IT'S NOT AN UNUSUAL.

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:02.745
CIRCUMSTANCE AND I ALSO KNOW

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:04.280

CHILDREN WERE BEING SUCCESSFUL.

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:15.024
BY WAY OF EXAMPLE. INSTEAD OF

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:16.459
RETRAINING A CHILD WE WOULD

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:17.493

FACULTY. WHEN WE HAVE THE

01:53:06.112 --> 01:53:08.181
TRAINEES AT SITES WHERE

01:53:08.248 --> 01:53:16.589
ESSENTIALLY. TO BEING TOLD THEY

BETTER- ON IS SOMETHING THAT

01:53:30.136 --> 01:53:31.471
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:53:31.538 --> 01:53:33.873
DOES DO. YOU ARE CORRECT THAT

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.241
SOME OF THE TRAINEES ARE

01:53:35.308 --> 01:53:36.609
IMPLICIT BUT THESE WHERE

01:53:36.676 --> 01:53:38.978
CERTAIN SERVICES FOR POLICY BE

01:53:39.045 --> 01:53:40.947
STREET AND- ARE IN FACT

01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:43.082
RESTRICTED. WE DO HAVE AN

01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:45.585
EXPECTATION. THAT ARE ATTENDING

01:53:45.652 --> 01:53:48.154
PHYSICIAN AND OUR OUR RESIDENTS

ARE- TRAINEES. ARE OPERATING

01:53:52.091 --> 01:53:54.027
BASED ON THEIR BEST MEDICAL

01:53:54.093 --> 01:53:56.396
VALUES AND JUDGMENTS. THAT THEY

01:53:56.462 --> 01:53:58.398
DON'T CHECK THEIR VALUES AT THE

01:53:58.464 --> 01:54:00.633
DOOR AND THAT THEY'RE EXPECTED

01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:03.536
TO YOU- PROCEED IN THAT WAY. SO

01:54:03.603 --> 01:54:05.905
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE- WE DON'T

01:54:05.972 --> 01:54:07.874
AGREE THAT THE FACILITIES

01:54:07.941 --> 01:54:09.776
SHOULD HAVE THOSE KIND OF

01:54:09.842 --> 01:54:12.378
RESTRICTIONS- BUT WE DO BELIEVE

01:54:12.445 --> 01:54:14.914
THAT THE UNIVERSITY AFFILIATING

01:54:14.981 --> 01:54:16.349
IN THOSE INSTANCES WITH

01:54:16.416 --> 01:54:17.817
HOSPITALS WHERE THEY DO HAVE

01:54:17.884 --> 01:54:19.819
THE RESTRICTION. IS STILL

01:54:19.886 --> 01:54:22.889
PREFERABLE- FOR PATIENTS. ARE

01:54:22.956 --> 01:54:25.425
BEING SEEN AT THOSE FACILITIES.

01:54:25.491 --> 01:54:27.026
YOU CAN THEN HAVE ACCESS TO

01:54:27.093 --> 01:54:29.095
POSITION YOU ARE GUARANTEED THE

01:54:29.162 --> 01:54:31.264
ABILITY. TO FACILITATE

01:54:31.331 --> 01:54:33.199
REFERRALS AND TO PROVIDE

01:54:33.266 --> 01:54:35.101
PRESCRIPTION AND TO PROVIDE

01:54:35.168 --> 01:54:41.641

RUN A TRAINING PROGRAM AT UC-

01:54:49.282 --> 01:54:52.085

THE- THE SOLUTION REALLY IS

01:55:12.905 --> 01:55:14.440
THAT REQUIRING HOSPITALS TO

ALLOW PHYSICIANS. TO FOLLOW

01:55:18.344 --> 01:55:18.811

01:57:34.547 --> 01:57:36.482
DEBATE DIRECTLY. CERTAINLY

01:57:36.549 --> 01:57:37.817
THERE ARE VARIETY DIFFERENT

01:57:37.884 --> 01:57:39.585
HOSPITALS THAT SPECIALIZE IN

01:57:39.652 --> 01:57:40.520
CERTAIN THINGS ARE WE HAVE

THAT PROVIDE RIGHT BUT I ALSO

01:57:50.296 --> 01:57:51.197
WANT TO POINT OUT FOR EXAMPLE

01:57:51.264 --> 01:57:52.331
JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE CANCER

01:57:52.398 --> 01:57:54.200
YOU MEDIA HOSPITAL SPECIALIZES

01:57:54.267 --> 01:57:55.368
IN CANCER DOESN'T MEAN ALL THE

01:57:55.435 --> 01:57:57.503
OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS GO AWAY.

01:57:57.570 --> 01:57:59.539
SO OFTEN TIMES WELL THE

01:57:59.605 --> 01:58:00.640
HOSPITAL MAY FOCUS ON

01:58:00.706 --> 01:58:03.209
PARTICULAR ASPECTS. OFTENTIMES

01:58:03.276 --> 01:58:05.211
THE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE

01:58:05.278 --> 01:58:06.579
PROVIDING SOME OTHER FORMS OF

01:58:06.646 --> 01:58:08.514
CAREAS WELL BECAUSE FAMILY IN

01:58:08.581 --> 01:58:10.049
PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS WHILE

WITH THAT HAS A CURE RIGHT AWAY

01:58:18.558 --> 01:58:21.294
SO- THERE IT DOESBLEED OVER

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:22.929
INTO AGENCY THERE'S CARE FOR

01:58:22.995 --> 01:58:29.902
OTHER TYPES OF HEALTH ISSUES.

01:58:29.969 --> 01:58:30.403

REALLY WELL IN AND TO BE MORE.

01:58:40.546 --> 01:58:42.415
ON BECAUSE THE USE. AND THE

01:58:42.482 --> 01:58:46.052
HOUSE ASSOCIATION POINT ITSELF.

01:58:46.118 --> 01:58:47.253
AFFILIATION WHERE YOU SEE THE

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:48.955
OR CANCER SPECIAL SERVICE INTO

01:58:49.021 --> 01:58:50.623
A OF THE TOP. YES TREATING FOR

01:58:50.690 --> 01:58:52.592
CANCER- BUT THE CANCER PATIENT

01:58:52.658 --> 01:58:54.827
MIGHT BE A WOMAN PREGNANT- AND

01:58:54.894 --> 01:58:56.128
SO THAT REDUCES OWN MEDICAL

01:58:56.195 --> 01:58:57.530
ISSUES THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE

01:58:57.597 --> 01:58:58.197
SURE THAT THE CANCER

CANCER PATIENT MIGHT BE TRANS

01:59:05.338 --> 01:59:06.506

HOW DO WE DO WE NEED TO ADJUST

01:59:08.708 --> 01:59:09.976
ANY HORMONES OR TAKE THAT INTO

01:59:10.042 --> 01:59:15.348
ACCOUNT. AND SO WHEN WE HAVETHESE THESE NON SCIENCE BASED

01:59:15.414 --> 01:59:17.517
RESTRICTIONS THAT CONTRADICTS.

01:59:17.583 --> 01:59:19.719
THE STANDARD OF CARE. YOU END

01:59:19.785 --> 01:59:21.354

02:06:56.141 --> 02:06:56.675
THE ECONOMY AT THE UNIVERSITY

02:06:56.742 --> 02:06:59.445
OF CALIFORNIA. IT WILL BE

02:06:59.511 --> 02:07:01.213
POLITICS SWIRL AROUND THIS

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:03.115
PLACE AND HAVE FOR MORE THAN A

02:07:03.182 --> 02:07:05.184
HUNDRED YEARS. AND WE HAVE IN

02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:07.853
THE WISDOM OF OUR FOUNDERS AND

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:09.989
OUR CURRENT. AND THE PEOPLE OF

02:07:10.055 --> 02:07:11.390
CALIFORNIA WE'VE GIVEN A LEVEL

02:07:11.457 --> 02:07:12.191
OF A TIME TO MEET THE

02:07:12.257 --> 02:07:14.259
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND

02:07:14.326 --> 02:07:15.694
HOW THEY DO THEIR WORK. AS WE

02:07:15.761 --> 02:07:17.529
DON'T WANT POLITICS DRIVING.

02:07:17.596 --> 02:07:20.566
THE ACADEMIC DECISIONS- AND TO

02:07:20.632 --> 02:07:21.300
SOME LEVEL WE'VE DONE THE SAME

02:07:21.367 --> 02:07:22.868
WITH THIS THIS THE- THE OTHER

02:07:22.935 --> 02:07:25.704
FOR YOUR SYSTEM THE CALIFORNIA

02:07:25.771 --> 02:07:28.407
STATE UNIVERSITY. AND THE GOAL

02:07:28.474 --> 02:07:31.043
THERE IS TO ENSURE THAT- THE

02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:33.579
POLITICAL WINDS OF THE MOMENT.

02:07:33.645 --> 02:07:34.680
I DON'T INTERFERE WITH THEIR

02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:38.751
THOUGHTFUL- GOVERNANCE OF THE

02:07:38.817 --> 02:07:41.687
UNIVERSITY. AND SO IT I

02:07:41.754 --> 02:07:42.521
UNDERSTAND THE AUTHORS

02:07:42.588 --> 02:07:44.623
INDICATED THAT THE UNIVERSITY

02:07:44.690 --> 02:07:47.159
OF CALIFORNIA HAS AS BEEN.

02:07:47.226 --> 02:07:48.060
HASN'T HAD A TASK FORCE ON THIS

02:07:48.127 --> 02:07:50.062
MATTER IS TAKING THE ISSUE

02:07:50.129 --> 02:07:53.165
SERIOUSLY- WAS PREPARED TO

02:07:53.232 --> 02:07:55.134
DELIBERATE AND TAKE SOME ACTION

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.468
ON IT THIS PAST YEAR BUT

02:07:56.535 --> 02:07:58.470
BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC QUITE

02:07:58.537 --> 02:08:01.440
UNDERSTANDABLY- THE MATTER GOT

02:08:01.507 --> 02:08:03.175
PUT TO THE SIDE BUT THEY HAVE.

02:08:03.242 --> 02:08:05.077
COMMITTED TO HAVING THAT

02:08:05.144 --> 02:08:07.479
THOUGHTFUL DELIBERATIONS. AMONG

02:08:07.546 --> 02:08:10.215
THE BOARD OF REGENTS- AT AND I

02:08:10.282 --> 02:08:12.051
GUESS WHAT'S TROUBLING TO ME IS

02:08:12.117 --> 02:08:13.852
THAT WHY WE WOULD GIVEN THE

02:08:13.919 --> 02:08:18.323
CHANCE TO ACT- THAT- YEAH WE

02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:19.992
CAN REVIEW THEIR ACTIONS AND

02:08:20.059 --> 02:08:21.193
DECIDE WHETHER WE THINK THEY'RE

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:23.162
GOOD OR BAD AND DECIDE WHETHER

02:08:23.228 --> 02:08:24.063
WE WANT TO BREAK DOWN THAT WALL

02:08:24.129 --> 02:08:26.799
OF- PROTECTION THAT'S BEEN IN

02:08:26.865 --> 02:08:28.367
PLACE FOR A LONG TIME. AND- YOU

02:08:28.434 --> 02:08:31.670
KNOW IT. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE

02:08:31.737 --> 02:08:32.871
KNOWN ME AND THAT THE THINGS

02:08:32.938 --> 02:08:34.873
THAT I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS

02:08:34.940 --> 02:08:36.475
ISSUE OF A TANAMI GOES WAY

02:08:36.542 --> 02:08:38.277
BEYOND THIS ISSUE AND WE HAVE

02:08:38.343 --> 02:08:39.278
HAD OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE COME

02:08:39.344 --> 02:08:42.081
BEFORE THE SENATE. THAT HAVE

02:08:42.147 --> 02:08:43.449
FIVE RAISE THE SAME CONCERNS

02:08:43.515 --> 02:08:46.051
AND QUESTIONS THAT I'VE

02:08:46.118 --> 02:08:46.652
DECLINED TO SUPPORT FOR THOSE

02:08:46.718 --> 02:08:52.357
REASONS. SO I AM- CONCERN THAT

02:08:52.424 --> 02:08:54.827
THAT WE'RE ACTING PREMATURELY-

02:08:54.893 --> 02:08:55.828
AND THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY

02:08:55.894 --> 02:08:58.030
GIVEN THEM THE CHANCE TO- TO

02:08:58.097 --> 02:08:59.765
MAKE CHOICES AND BY THE WAY.

02:08:59.832 --> 02:09:01.667
THAT WE DO HAVE AN ABILITY TO

02:09:01.733 --> 02:09:02.167
INFLUENCE UNIVERSITY OF

02:09:02.234 --> 02:09:04.470
CALIFORNIA AND OUR RULES OF THE

02:09:04.536 --> 02:09:06.872
SENATE WE CONFIRM EVERY REGION

02:09:06.939 --> 02:09:08.507
APPOINTEE BY THE GOVERNOR. AND

02:09:08.574 --> 02:09:09.875
I I'D BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING

02:09:09.942 --> 02:09:11.543
WHETHER THE REGION APPOINTEES

02:09:11.610 --> 02:09:12.811
THAT WE'VE CONFIRMED OVER THE

02:09:12.878 --> 02:09:13.912
LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN ASKED

02:09:13.979 --> 02:09:15.614
THESE QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY

02:09:15.681 --> 02:09:17.149
ABOUT THIS TYPE OF AN ISSUE.

02:09:17.216 --> 02:09:18.817
BECAUSE THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE

02:09:18.884 --> 02:09:20.686
PLACE FOR US TO HAVEINPUT.

02:09:20.752 --> 02:09:22.955
INTO THEIR WORK IS TO ENSURE

02:09:23.021 --> 02:09:25.190

THIS BILL- WHICH I SUPPORT-

02:09:35.267 --> 02:09:38.103
THE- SECOND ISSUE WHICH- HAS

02:09:38.170 --> 02:09:38.871
PARTLY BEEN RAISED BY THE

02:09:38.937 --> 02:09:41.206
SENATOR FROM YUCAIPA- IS THIS

02:09:41.273 --> 02:09:43.909
QUESTION OF THAT MANY OF THESE

02:09:43.976 --> 02:09:45.811
CONTRACTS ARE NARROWLY-

02:09:45.878 --> 02:09:48.447
FOCUSED. IN AREAS THAT DON'T

02:09:48.514 --> 02:09:51.183
TOUCH. MEDICAL CARE FOR WOMEN

02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:53.886
OR TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS- NOW

02:09:53.952 --> 02:09:56.355
THE AUTHOR MADE RAP REFERENCE

02:09:56.421 --> 02:09:58.524
TO CANCER CENTER WE I GUESS THE

02:09:58.590 --> 02:10:00.726
UC PARTNERS TO. MANAGE A CANCER

02:10:00.792 --> 02:10:02.161
CENTER AND THERE COULD BE

02:10:02.227 --> 02:10:04.329
ISSUES THAT CROSS OVER- AND

02:10:04.396 --> 02:10:08.734
RAISE QUESTIONS- BUT WE ALSO.

02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:10.669
AT TWO TWENTY YEAR CAL ALSO.

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:14.406
RADIATION ONCOLOGY TREATMENT-

02:10:14.473 --> 02:10:18.177
NEONATAL SERVICES AND SO IT

02:10:18.243 --> 02:10:19.711
CERTAINLY SEEMS THAT THERE IS.

02:10:19.778 --> 02:10:21.413
A BREATH OF THESE CONTRACTS

02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:25.651
THAT GO WAY BEYOND- THE

02:10:25.717 --> 02:10:27.686
POTENTIAL TO UNDERMINE. THE

02:10:27.753 --> 02:10:29.888
TYPE OF- THE SUPPORT THAT WE

02:10:29.955 --> 02:10:31.690
ALL THAT MANY OF US FEEL-

02:10:31.757 --> 02:10:34.293
IMPORTANT- IN THE AREA OF

02:10:34.359 --> 02:10:34.960
REPRODUCTIVE AND GENDER

OF THIS COMMITTEE IS THE ISSUE

02:10:44.169 --> 02:10:48.373
OF CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS. AND

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:49.741
RESIDENCY OPPORTUNITIES AND I

02:10:49.808 --> 02:10:54.246
DO KNOW. THAT FOR IN MANY

02:10:54.313 --> 02:10:58.083
FIELDS THERE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT.

02:10:58.150 --> 02:10:59.918
OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR TUDENTS

02:10:59.985 --> 02:11:01.753
TO HAVE THOSE CLINICAL

REQUIREMENTS BE MET AND WE HAVE

02:11:04.389 --> 02:11:06.024
DEBATED IN VARIOUS COMMITTEES

02:11:06.091 --> 02:11:08.160
AT THE SENATE AND ON THE FLOOR

02:11:08.227 --> 02:11:11.730
THE SENATE HOW THAT IS LIMITING.

02:11:11.797 --> 02:11:14.299
ACCESS TO CARE BECAUSE WE DON'T

02:11:14.366 --> 02:11:16.335

THE AUTONOMY OF THE UNIVERSITY

02:12:23.201 --> 02:12:24.269
OF CALIFORNIA'S NOT SOMETHING I

02:12:24.336 --> 02:12:26.338
DO VERY EASILY. BUT IF THE BILL

02:12:26.405 --> 02:12:27.706
WAS TO ADVANCE I HOPE THAT IT

02:12:27.773 --> 02:12:29.775
WOULD BE BE NARROWED TO TAKE

02:12:29.841 --> 02:12:32.477
INTO ACCOUNT- PLACES IN WHICH-

02:12:32.544 --> 02:12:34.179
