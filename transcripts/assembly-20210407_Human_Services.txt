AB EIGHT TWENTY NINE REQUIRES COUNTIES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES REGARDING CURRENT PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO SUPPORT UNDOCUMENTED MINOR AND NON MINOR DEPENDENTS IN FOSTER CARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE JUVENILE COURT AND THEIR PROCESSES TO PROVIDE THESE YOUTH WITH IMMIGRATION RESOURCES AB EIGHT TWENTY NINE ALSO REQUIRES COUNTIES TO MAKE BEST EFFORTS TO PROVIDE UNDOCUMENTED COMMITTED MINOR OR NON MINOR DEPENDENTS IN FOSTER CARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE JUVENILE COURT WITH ACCESS TO IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES MEMBERS. WE ALL WANT OUR FOSTER YOUTH TO BE SUCCESSFUL FOR UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH THIS MEASURE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS HELPING THEM OBTAIN LAWFUL RESIDENCY PURSUE THEIR GOALS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA ARE STUCK THEY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER NINE- OPERATORS- CAN WE PLEASE OPEN THE LINE FOR FIRST WITNESS. PLEASE KERRY WHITE. THE LINE IS OPEN YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU MY NAME IS KERRY WHITE AND I AM AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY WITH CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER OF CALIFORNIA CLC IS A NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES AS THE VOICE IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND HE- OUR ATTORNEYS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS STAFF REPRESENT OVER THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND ABUSED. AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN IN THE LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO IN PLASTER COUNTY FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. IN ADDITION TO APPEARING ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS AND DATED A DEPENDENCY PROCEEDINGS. GLC PROVIDES REPRESENTATION AND A HOST OF RELATED HEARING THAT SEEKS TO ENSURE THE WELL BEING AND FUTURE SUCCESS THAT EACH CHILD. WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE. FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION WHICH WILL ENSURE THEIR PROCESSES IN PLACE TO PROTECT UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN WHO ENTER THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FORMS OF IMMIGRATION RELIEF THAT WOULD PUT THEM ON A PATH TOWARD OBTAINING LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS ALSO KNOWN AS THE GREEN CARD. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE MENTIONED CONGRESS RECOGNIZED THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES AND VULNERABILITIES UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH AND IN RESPONSE CREATED A SPECIFIC FORM OF IMMIGRATION RELIEF FOR THE FEW WHO ARE UNABLE TO REUNIFY WITH A PARENT CALLED SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS. WHICH IS ITSELF A PATH TOWARDS LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENT. I'M DOCUMENT CHILDREN WHO LEAVE THE DEPENDENCIES WITHOUT OBTAINING SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS OR SOME OTHER FORM OF IMMIGRATION RELIEF WILL BE UNABLE TO LAWFULLY WORK FOR TRANSITION SUCCESSFULLY TO ADULTHOOD. HOWEVER THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THESE UNITS ARE IDENTIFIED AND LINKED WITH IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDER TO ASSIST THEM IN OBTAINING IMMIGRATION RELIEF. AS A RESULT THE LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE TO YOU RECEIVED ON THEIR IMMIGRATION MATTER VARIES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. SAMPLE IN COUNTY SUCH AS SACRAMENTO OUR LAWYERS ARE TYPICALLY THE ONES SEARCHING FOR AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY OR NONPROFIT TO REPRESENT OUR CLIENTS. IN COMPARISON LOS ANGELES THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY WORKS CLOSELY WITH OUR ATTORNEYS TO IDENTIFY LOCAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND PRO BONO ATTORNEYS WHO WILL PROVIDE IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES FOR OUR CLIENTS. WE HAVE ALSO HEARD ACCOUNTS OF OTHER COUNTIES WHERE NO IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES ARE OBTAINED AND AS A RESULT USED. TO NOT REPEAT THE IMMIGRATION RELIEF TO WHICH THEY ARE. AND WE THE FARM CARE TO WITHOUT IMMIGRATION. UNDER CHILDREN IN. HE SAID ALL FACE AND NOT OF HER. AS THREE BILLION THE TO WOULD LOW TO NO IN FOR. OR DOC. ABOUT THEIR- STATUS. EVEN THEY ARE IN REMOVAL OR DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS. EIGHTY EIGHT TWENTY NINE WILL REQUIRE THE COUNTY CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE TO IDENTIFY AND TRACK UNDOCUMENTED FOSTER YOUTH IN THEIR COUNTIES. IT WILL REQUIRE THAT THE AGENCIES MAKE BEST EFFORTS TO LINK THESE CHILDREN TO IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND IF NECESSARY IDENTIFY ANY GAPS IN SERVICES AND SUPPORT. ALL OF THESE MEASURES ARE AIMED AT ENSURING THAT UNDOCUMENTED POSTURE YOU TO NOT FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE IMMIGRATION RELIEF FOR WHICH THEY ARE SO FREQUENTLY ELIGIBLE WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION.

AND WHO SHOULD BE AWARDED THIS GRANT I'M CAN YOU DESCRIBE TO ME OF WHO THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE HOW THE SENATE AS WELL AS- WHAT TYPE OF BACKGROUND EXPERIENCE- DO YOU ENVISION SITTING ON THE SUPPORT- AND ALSO YOUR INTERESTING QUESTION- THE CREEK CRADLE TO CAREER- GRANT PROGRAM IS REALLY INFORMED BY SOMETHING THAT'S GROWN FROM OUR COMMUNITIES- AND SO THE EXPECTATION IS THAT- THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE BORROWING OR- SEEKING ASSISTANCE FROM HE'S PROVEN LOCAL MODELS FROM OUR OWN COMMUNITIES THAT. HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. IS THERE IT IS THERE SOMETHING THAT I WAS THE AYE I SEE GOING WITH THE MODEL MAY BECOME COMING FROM YOURSELF DESERVE YOU DOES ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD SEE LIKE HOW YOU WOULD WANT TO SEE SITTING ON THE BOARD WHICH I THINK SUPPORT THAT WOULD MAKE THAT UP. WELL I THINK WE HEARD FROM WITNESSES THAT THAT REALLY ARE INFORMED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE'RE SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO HAVE- SAFE AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIES THAT THAT CHILDREN CAN BE RAISED IN AND TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE THAT THAT HAVE. THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED AND THESE ARE THE LOCAL MODELS THAT NO BETTER THAN I THINK. ME IS JUST ONE LAWMAKER- CAN DECIDE- ON MY OWN BUT BUT THESE ARE. KIND OF THE EXEMPLARS RIGHT AND- AND I THINK WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT EXCELLENT WORK THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT'S REALLY THE SEED FROM WHICH THIS BILL. WAS PLANTED AND BORN FROM. THANK YOU HAS TO BE ON. SURE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO GO HAVE YEAH OKAY BACK TO ALL REFER HER RIGHT NUMBER OF JUST FOUR SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OF WHAT TWO YEAR PROGRAM- YEAH I FIND IT TOUGH HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED ON NUMBER OF- CHILDREN WHO WOULD BE GETTING THE BENEFIT OF THIS BEYOND THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE QUESTION NUMBER TWO QUESTION IS- NOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE HELPING OUT WITH THIS A GRANT- DO CHIPMAN GAP IN THE SCHOOL- HOW DO YOU DEFINE ACHIEVEMENT GAP- BUT SHE GRADE TO DEGRADE THE L. HALL. WHAT KIND A SCHOOL OR GRADE THE ALL PERFORMSO WILL BE A SELF TO OF WHAT. WELL I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE INTEREST AS A PRE- I THINK THE GRAND. IS ALSO APPRECIATED- AS FAR AS THE NUMBERS I THINK THAT THAT'S A DECISION FOR THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO REALLY DETERMINE WHAT THAT NUMBER WILL ULTIMATELY BE. IF WE LOOK AT THE GRAND SCOPE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT WE SPEND FOR ANTI POVERTY MEASURES FOR EDUCATION- WHICH I THINK IS A HUGE ANTI POVERTY MEASURE RIGHT WE'RE SPEAKING IN THE THAT TENS AND TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS UP MORE THAN THAT RIGHT SO. THIS IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY- TO TRY TO IDENTIFY WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE MAKING GOOD INVESTMENTS AND SO WE ARE WE ARE INVESTING YOU KNOW PROBABLY A HUNDRED BILLION PLUS IF YOU START TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE AS WELL- SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT WE TALK A LOT ABOUT NOT MAKING- THE LACK OF MAKING. DATA INFORMED DECISIONS AND THIS IS JUST A VERY SMALL EFFORT TO DO THAT- SO I AGAIN I WILL LEAD- LEAVE THE TO THE DEPARTMENT AND- THE GRANT MAKING PROCESS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE CREATING TO REALLY IDENTIFY HOW TO. DO THAT PASSED I DON'T WANT TO LEGISLATE EXACTLY HOW IT'S DONE BECAUSE- THEN THEY'RE STUCK WITH IT- AND WE'VE SEEN THAT THE ERRORS OF THAT WAY. SO ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION. OR WILL BE DETERMINED. BASED UPON THE TARGET NUMBER OF ALL PEOPLE WHO MAY- BE ABLE TO GET THE BENEFITS OF FROM THIS- PROGRAM WELL I WISH THAT WE COULD MAKE DECISIONS THAT WAY BUT I THINK THAT WE ARE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS YOU IDENTIFIED YEAH BASED UPON WHAT- A DATA HAVE YOU PROPOSED TO SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR TWO YEARS SO THIS IS REALLY GOING TO BE INFORMED BY THE BUDGET PROCESS THAT THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE ASKING SO WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS WHAT IS THAT RIGHT NUMBER AND HOW MANY CHILDREN. RIGHT THAT WE'RE WE'RE SEEKING THE IMPACT WITH UNDERSTANDING DATA- I DON'T THINK THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IS LIMITED- NECESSARILY BECAUSE DATA INFORMED DECISION MAKING THEN LEADS TO BETTER INVESTMENTS SO I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WE ARE GOING TO IMPACT ALMOST ANY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S MY GOAL THIS. IS I HONESTLY ONE OF MOST CONSEQUENTIAL BILLS ALL ALL AUTHOR ON BEHALF OF HELPING EVERY CHILD REACH HER FULL POTENTIAL. WHAT WILL YOU BE ON- BENEFIT- EVERYONE. WHO HAS- ACHIEVEMENT GAP ACADEMICALLY OR WOULD THIS BE ON ANY TARGETING FOR CERTAIN INCOME BRACKET. WELL I THINK THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE DATA INFORMED DECISIONS ON OUR- ANTI POVERTY AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP INVESTMENTS SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH A LOT BEING INFORMED BY THE DATA AS TO WHAT INTERVENTIONS ARE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ONES IN CALIFORNIA.

WORD I THIRTY SEVEN ZERO THANK YOU CONGRATULATIONS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILLION YES THANK YOU MADAM. CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I WILL NOT PRESENT MY FINAL BILL TODAY D. THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE RELATING TO THE SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION OF PRESCHOOL STUDENTS THE BILL HAS THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS EACH OF WHICH WILL STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SYSTEM TO BETTER SERVE OUR STATE. FIRST THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION OF PRESCHOOL AGE STUDENTS DROP CALIFORNIA EARLY LEARNING SYSTEM. NATIONAL DATA HAS INDICATED TO VERY CONCERNING TRENDS AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION NOT ONLY ARE THE SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS MORE COMMON IN PRESCHOOL- IN THE PRESCHOOL SETTING DOWN IN K. TWELVE THEY ARE ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT CHILDREN OF COLOR. ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN REPRESENT 18% OF PRESCHOOL ENROLLMENT BUT 42% OF PRESCHOOL SUSPENSIONS. RESEARCH HAS ALSO INDICATED THAT THE SCHOOL EXPULSION AND SUSPENSION PRACTICES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE EDUCATIONAL AND LIFE OUTCOMES. IN ADDITION TO HARMING YOUNG CHILD'S ACADEMIC PROSPECTS RESEARCH HAS ALSO FOUND THAT SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS DO NOTHING TO IMPACT THE ROOT CAUSE OF CHALLENGING BEHAVIOR. WELL THIS FIRST MAJOR COMPONENT IDENTIFIES A KEY PROBLEM CALIFORNIA'S PRESCHOOL SYSTEM AND MOVES TO IMMEDIATELY AND HARM FOR PRACTICES THE NEXT COMPONENT OF THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO CREATE A PROACTIVE SOLUTION. AND WE ARE DOING THIS THROUGH THE USE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION OTHER OTHERWISE KNOWN AS EASY M. H. C. B. C. M. H. C. SERVICES ARE A PROVEN MOEL WORRY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WILL ENTRY PRESCHOOL SETTING. AND PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE STUDENT THE STAFF AND THE FAMILIES THESE SERVICES CREATE A MEANS OF PROVIDING ADEQUATE SUPPORT TO TEACHERS CHILDREN AND FAMILIES TO PROMOTE POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH. BUT FOR THE EFFECTS OF TOXIC STRESS AND TRAUMA AND BRING OUT THE MOST OPTIMAL DEVELOPMENT AND. LEARNING EACH AND EVERY CHILD. SO WITH THIS BILL WE ARE NOT SIMPLY TO HAND OFF PROVIDERS. I'M SORRY WE'RE NOT SIMPLY TYING THE HANDS OF PROVIDERS BY LIMITING SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS WE'RE ALSO PROVIDING THEM WITH A NEW TOOL TO HELP ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES. IN BEHAVIOR IN A MORE HOLISTIC AND POSITIVE MANNER. THE FINAL COMPONENT OF THIS BILL WILL BE FOR THE STATE TO BEGIN COLLECTING DATA ON THE USE OF SUSPENSION AND EXPULSIONS SO THAT POLICY MAKERS HERE. CAN HAVE A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR SYSTEM IS WORKING. THIS LEGISLATION HAS HAD INPUT FROM POLICY EXPERTS THROUGHOUT OUR NATION AND ENJOYS A LARGE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT. THE BILL HAS NO KNOWN OPPOSITION AND IS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S EARLY LEARNING AND CARE MASTER PLAN RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR. I ALSO WANT TO STATE THAT IT'S A BILL THAT'S NEAR AND DEAR TO ME I- SPENT SIXTEEN SIXTEEN YEARS AS A TEACHER THREE OF THOSE AS A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER AND- I CAN TELL YOU. FIRSTHAND THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL WHICH KIDS COME IN WITH TRAUMA AND WHICH DON'T AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS TO ADDRESS THE TRAUMA WE WERE EXPECTED TO. TEACH EVERY CHILD THE SAME WAY AND SO FOR ME THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE'RE ADDRESSING THE ROOT OF THE CAUSE. AND NOT JUST FOR THE CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES BUT THEY'RE ASSISTING THE TEACHERS WHICH I THINK IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT. BECAUSE WE'RE ALL NOT GOOD TEACHERS KNOW A LOT BUT WE DON'T WE'RE NOT A MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AND SO THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THOSE. THAT ASSISTANCE TO THOSE TEACHERS AND THEN NOW I HAVE ON THE PHONE OUR SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS THANK YOU. THE OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KAI JACKSON WITH BLACK MEN FOR EDUCATIONAL EQUITY AN ORGANIZATION OF BLACK MEN WHO ARE PARENTS UNCLES BROTHERS AND SONS FROM THE ENTIRETY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE WAKE OF GEORGE FLOYD BLACK MEN FOR EDUCATIONAL EUITY CAME TOGETHER WHILE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE EXPRESS A DESIRE TO BUILD MORE EQUITABLE EDUCATION SYSTEM TO INCLUDE EARLY LEARNING CARE SYSTEM WE HAVE SEEN AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL THAT THE SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE A DIRECT PATHWAY INTO THE JUVENILE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IT HAD BEGINNING IN CHILDREN AS EARLY AS- ZERO AGES ZERO TO FIVE. WE SEE ELEVATED LEVELS OF EXCLUSIONARY DISCIPLINE IN NATIVE AMERICAN AND LATINO LATINO CHILDREN YET NO OTHER STUDENT GROUP EXPERIENCES LEVEL THE DISPROPORTIONATE DISCIPLINE GREATER THAN BLACK MALE CHILDREN WELL MORE DATA IS NEEDED IN CALIFORNIA GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE IN A REPORT BY DEAN THE PROFESSORS AT UCLA AND SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY FOUND THAT BLACK BOYS FOR FIVE POINT SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE SUSPENDED THAN THE STATE AVERAGE FURTHERMORE A REPORT BY WALTER GILLIAM IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FOUND THAT MILLIE MANY PRESCHOOL TEACHERS LOOK FOR DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR OFTEN HAVING AN ACUTE FOCUS ON CHILDREN OF COLOR MORE THAN ANY OTHER GROUP. I LIKE TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT AND IS NOT INTENDED DEVELOP BY TEACHERS AND PROVIDERS OR AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE AND APPRECIATED- A GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS IN OUR STATE HOWEVER IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT EARLY LEARNING AND CARE SYSTEMS WORK TO ELIMINATE THE SUSPENSION OF YOUNG. CHILDREN AND YOUNG BATES. INDIAN CHILDREN LEARN AND CARE INVOLVED HAPPEN TOWARDS SCHOOL AND BY. AND ALSO ROLLED STUDENTS. WITH THEIR- AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION AS ASSEMBLY REMEMBER RUBIO MENTIONED PROVIDERS CAN ADDRESS BEHAVIOR AND CONSIDER INTERVENTION SUPPORTS. SUCH AS THE INVOLVEMENT OF FAMILY MEMBERS INDIVIDUALIZED BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION AND OTHER IN SCHOOL STRATEGIES SUCH AS EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION. WHICH REYES PROVIDERS AWARENESS ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND BUILD THEIR CAPACITY TO EXPOSING THEM TO CONCRETE ALTERNATIVES. THIS BILL IS ABOUT INCLUSION THE GOAL IS ABOUT KEEPING OUR KIDS AND LEARNING CARE ENVIRONMENTS. NOT TO ISOLATE OR REMOVE THEM FROM THOSE STATUS. THE BILL ENSURE THAT OUTCOME BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE AND RESOURCES AND TOOLS TO PROVIDERS. JEFF IN CLOSING TO REINFORCE WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO SAID. THIS BILL WOULD ONLY BE USED AS A LAST RESORT AND IT IN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. WHERE SIRIUS INVALIDATED EIGHTY CONCERNS ARE ADDED PERTAINS TO EXPLOSION AND- THIS PENSION. BILL REQUIRED THE STATE TO COLLECT AND PUBLISH DATA ON EXCLUSIONARY PRACTICES AND STRENGTHENS DUE PROCESS. FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION. IT PROVIDE EQUITABLE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS FOR ALL STUDENTS AND ELIMINATE EXCLUSIONARY PRACTICES. THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PRESCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE AND LASTLY IT'S PRINTED BEEN CLARIFIED THE EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION SERVICES.

THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS UP THANK THE AUTHOR AND TEACHER. AND IF WE COULD BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR MUCH. MORE. MORE THANK YOU ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- OFFERING THIS FOR PUTTING THE WORK INTO THIS I'M CLEARLY A REALLY CRITICAL AREA UPDATE THAT IS NEEDED- AS THE PARENT OF- NOW MY SECOND CHILD GOING THROUGH CHILD DEVELOPMENT. I CAN'T IMAGINE- YOU KNOW. A RANDOM SITUATION. WHERE THEY WOULD TRY TO USE A SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION ON ANY OF THE KIDS ARE THAT HE IS GOING TO- THE CENTER WITH- THEY ALL LOVE TO CHILDREN- THEY ALL COME WITH DIFFERENT SETS OF CHALLENGES THAT IT DOES NOT MEAN WE ABANDON THEM. WE FIGURE IT OUT WE PROVIDE AND THE TOOLS THAT I THINK SHOULD BE A BASELINE THE POLICY HERE FOR THE STATE AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THIS BILL IS HEADED IN IS SO IMPORTANT- AND TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS AN OPPORTUNITY ALSO TO UNDERSTAND. THAT DISPARITIES THAT WE KNOW ARE OCCURRING YES- CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO- I ALSO WOULD BE HONORED TO SERVE AS A CO AUTHOR AS WELL AND I REALLY. WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS WORK. THANK AYE SOMEONE TRIED TWO REQUIRE. THANK YOU CHAIR. ON A SAN MULLIN- RUBIO. I SHE THE- SMALL MANY BENEFITS SOME OF- YOUR BILL. ON TO PROHIBIT. THE CHILDREN ARE YOUNG CHILDREN FROM PRESCHOOL OR SO TO BE SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED FOR THE OF BEHAVIORS- AND- IT. THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS SO PROHIBITING UNLESS IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN EXPAND ON WHAT THE LAST PORTION. IN WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES SO THAT THE SUSPENSION OR- EXPLOSION WOULD BE ALLOWED TO AND- MAYBE EVEN BEFORE THAT TIME. ALWAYS- FOR THIS KIND OF EXTREME MEASURES SET TO BE CONSIDERED OR TAKEN- PROBABLY- TRADITIONALLY TEACHERS OR OR THE ENTITY COULD NOT HANDLE THE CHILD. SO THIS ONE IS A PROHIBITING UNLESS A FEW. EXCEPTIONS TO WHICH OUR WHEN I HEAR ABOUT. WELL AND OBVIOUSLY. THE DECIDE TO FOR EXAMPLE WERE ARRESTED BEHAVIOR- IF THE CHILD CARE TIPS ON- MANY DIFFERENT FORMS OF AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR LIKE CRICKETING CONSISTENTLY. AND THAT THERE'S A DEAL TO SIDE OF ALL EQUATION VICTIMS MMHM OKAY MAYBE WE CAN CALL IT. EVEN THOUGHT THIS CHILDREN BORN MAY NEED THAT ON ON WHAT THEY ARE DOING. UNTIL THEY BECOME OLDER SO AT THIS A LITTLE CHILDREN THIS IS JUST A DIFFERENT PERSONALITY CHARACTER EXHIBITING THAT KIND OF THINGS. AND- ON AT UPON DO THAT DON'T AS THE GOOD COUPON. BUT IF YOU'RE A QUESTION A PARTICULAR CHARGES SO CONTINUES TO BE HARASSED OR BULLIED. ARE THERE SOME VICTOR. AND THE CHILD IS A PROHIBITED FROM BEING EXPELLED INTO CONTINUOUSLY COMES INTO YOUR CHILD HAPPENS TO BE THE VICTIM AND CONTINUES TO HARASS YOUR CHILD IS A MENTAL. SPATTER SO WILL BE DAMAGED. AND JUST START START THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE OR BE YOU KNOW HONG. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT ASPECT YOU AT THE SIDE OF THE EQUATION ABSOLUTELY- WELL FIRST AND FOREMOST THE CHILDREN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS AND- THROUGH THE STATISTICS THAT WE WERE REVEALING ONE OF THEM THE MAJOR CAUSES OF THE EXPLOSION HAS BEEN BITING- IF YOU LOOK AT A DEVELOPMENTAL CHARRED- THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS BITE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND COMMUNICATE. SO THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY CAN EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION OR ANY YOU KNOW ANY OTHER ANYTHING THAT'S GOING ON AT HOME SO THAT'S A PRIMARY YOU KNOW WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT TO THIRTY THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS- BUT TO YOUR POINT AS A TEACHER IS A FORMER KINDERGARTEN TEACHER I CAN TELL YOU THAT I CAN HAVE THE BEST PLANS AND THAT- AND ONE DAY AND ONE CHILD CAN DISRUPT THE WHOLE ENTIRE DAY. SO WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON THIS BILL I TOOK THAT INTO CONSIDERATION THE PROBLEM IS THAT THAT WE CAN EXPEL CHILDREN AND THEY'RE REALLY NOT GETTING ANY KIND OF SERVICES WERE JUST REMOVING THEM FROM THE SITUATION AND ARE NOT ONLY ARE WE REMOVING THEM FROM THE SITUATION THEIR GAIN CONDITION THAT IF THEY ACT THIS WAY THEY GET TO GO HOME. RIGHT SO NOW WE'RE ENCOURAGING BY BY SENDING THEM HOME WE'RE REALLY PROMOTING THE FACT THAT HEY IF YOU DO THIS YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO GO HOME AND SO THAT'S ALSO DETRIMENTAL TO THE EDUCATION OF THAT CHILD AND TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE OTHER KIDS IN THE CLASSROOM YOU ARE CORRECT. THE POINT TO THIS BILL IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST PREVENTING THE EXPULSION ARE THE SUSPENSION BUT IT'S ALSO PROVIDING THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR ED TRADITIONALLY WE'VE ONLY DONE IT TO THE CHILD INTO THE FAMILY AS IF TEACHERS MAGICALLY KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS AND THEY DON'T. SO THAT MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION TAKES THE THREE COMPONENTS THAT CHILD THE FAMILY AND THE TEACHER BECAUSE A LOT OF TEACHERS LIKE I SAID I'M AN EXPERT AT A LOT OF THINGS OR I CAN TEACH A LOT OF CONTENT BUT I DON'T I'M NOT QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE ANY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO CHILDREN BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THE CHILD CAN BE ACTING UP- AND YOU THINK THEY'RE JUST BEING BULLIES. BUT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE EATEN IN THE MORNING. MOM AND DAD GOT INTO A FIGHT IN THE EVENING YOU KNOW WE ARE HOLD. OF THIS THAT THE IN AND THE CHILDREN DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS IT ESPECIALLY THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD. SO THE MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT NOT ONLY HELPS THE CHILD AMBER THE FAMILY. BUT ALSO THE TEACHER. TO DEFLECT THE SITUATION DIFFUSE IT AT A DIFFERENT WAY. BUT IT'S NOT JUST. A CHART OF THIS IS WHAT YOU DO THIS IS. SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO SIT WITH THE FAMILY WITH A CHILD- THE PARENT AND THE TEACHER TO IDENTIFIED THAT CHILD'S PARTICULAR- WHY THERE. ARE BEING AGGRESSIVE OR WHATEVER THAT THE ISSUE MAYBE. SO THIS IS NOT. A CHECK OFF LIST- THIS IS INDIVIDUALIZED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THAT INCLUDES THE TEACHERS SO THAT THE TEACHER CAN DIFFUSE THE SITUATION. NOW IF IT CONTINUES AND WE'RE GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THEN. THERE THERE SHOULD THERE SHOULD BE A MEETING- BETWEEN THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL AND THE FAMILY TO TRY TO IDENTIFY. IT ARE THERE OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE. AND IF NOT. IS THE MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION EVEN HOT OUT HELPING AND IF IT'S NOT HELPING AT THAT POINT YOU HAVE A MEETING WITH. THE FAMILY. AND BUT THE PERSONALITIES CALL AND DECIDE WHAT THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE. BUT I THINK AND I BELIEVE LIKE I SAID AS A AS A FORMER TEACHER IS THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING TO THE ROOT. OF THE ISSUE IF WE JUST SEND THEM HOME YOU'RE JUST SENDING THEM HOME FOR WHAT. YOU CAN EXPECT. THE KIDS TO THE CHILD TO COME BACK THE NEXT DAY AND BE FIXED. BECAUSE WE HADN'T HAVEN'T PROVIDED ANY KIND OF SUPPORT YOU JUST SENT THEM HOME AND GUESS WHAT THEY DID ALL DAY. PLAY VIDEO GAMES WATCH TV WHATEVER THE ISSUE MAYBE. BUT NEVER ADDRESS THE ACTUAL ISSUE. SO HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION THAT. WE CAN TAKE STEPS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- FOR THE TEACHER THAT BOTH. THE STUDENT AND THE FAMILY TO TRY AND SUPPORT HEM THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE. IF IT'S AN EXTREME CASE OF COURSE THAT'S GOING TO BE ADDRESSED LATER- AND IN TERMS OF THE CHILDREN THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BEING VICTIMIZED. IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THE ISSUES. RIGHT NOW. THAT CHILD. IS GOING TO CONTINUE IN KINDERGARTEN FIRST GRADE SO GET INVENTOR GRADE- ACT. OUT THIS. SO YOUR CHILD- THAT YOU WERE THINKING MIGHT BE A VICTIM RIGHT NOW MAY BE A VICTIM FOR CAN TO FIRST AND SECOND AND THIRD GRADE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT FIXING THAT. OR AT LEAST ASSISTING THE CHILD AND WHATEVER ISSUES THAT THEY'RE HAVING. AND SO. AS A TEACHER I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT AGAIN I CAN HAVE THE BEST LESSON PLANS. AND ONE CHILD CAN DISRUPT THE WHOLE ENTIRE DAY BUT UNLESS WE ACTUALLY TREAT WHATEVER THE ISSUE IS. AND INSTEAD OF JUST IGNORING IT AND THEY JUST GO HOME. AND THEY COME BACK THE NEXT DAY YOU HAVEN'T FIXED ANYTHING SO. BUT MY HOPE IS AND I THINK- THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THIS IS PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH- CONSULTATION. WILL HELP THE PARENT THE STUDENT AND THE TEACHER TO TRY AND- IDENTIFY WHAT THE ISSUES ARE. AND IF THERE ARE EXTREME CASES OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO SIT DOWN WITH THE SCHOOL PERSONNEL AND FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT. A DIFFERENT- A WAY OF ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES BUT SENDING THEM HOME DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY. I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. ON THAT BRING SAMPLE. NEXT TO LEVEL OR- A QUESTION- IF OUR OP. OF A PRESCHOOL OR- AND- YOU APPEAR REQUIRES INVOLVING PARENTS AND THEM MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS. BEFORE EXPENSE- IT IS SUSPENDING EXPANDING THE SHONDA SO THAT IS- WHO'S GOING TO PROVIDE THAT THE MEANT MENTAL HEALTH A PROVIDER- THE OPERATOR OR THE COUNTY OR STATE TO WHO'S GONNA PAY FOR THE- MENTAL HAVE OKAY SO FIRST OF ALL SO THIS BILL IS SPECIFICALLY TO ANY- PRESCHOOL OR ARE EASY CENTER THAT IS I HAD FUNDING FROM THE STATE. AND THEN WE WILL PROVIDE THE FUNDING FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH CALLED CONSULTATION WE DID AYE AYE A PORTION OF THIS BILL- LAST YEAR TWO YEARS AGO MY DOCTOR TWO YEARS AGO AND IT'S BEEN WORKING SO FAR WE DID HAVE SOME SOME ISSUES WITH THE FUNDING BECAUSE IT WAS PROP- IT WAS ALL BUDGETED THROUGH THE STATE. YOU MEAN THE STATE YES THE STATE SO ANYBODY THAT RECEIVED ANY STATE FUNDING IS THE ONE THAT HAS TO COMPLY WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATIONS AND WOULD BACK THEM THE MONEY COMES FROM IS NOT GOING TO COST TO THE OPERATOR YEAH.
