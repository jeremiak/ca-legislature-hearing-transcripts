00:59:39.876 --> 00:59:40.944
WHAT ONE OF THE FINES WAS -- FOR

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:43.313

00:59:50.019 --> 00:59:52.655
IF THEY HAD JUST TOLD ME THAT I

00:59:52.722 --> 00:59:54.290

FORCED TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS SO.

01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:12.141
AB FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE WOULD

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:14.277
PERMIT NOT REQUIRED BUT PERMIT

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:17.580
STATE AGENCIES THE DISCRETION.

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:18.982
TO REDUCE OUR MEDICAID FINDS IN

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:20.083
APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES AND

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:21.317
THOSE APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:23.786
ARE VERY NARROWLY TAILORED --

01:00:23.853 --> 01:00:26.389
ONLY IN CASES WHERE THE BUSINESS

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:27.857
WAS A FIRST TIME VIOLATOR --

01:00:27.924 --> 01:00:29.759
ONLY IN CASES WHEN THE BUSINESS

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:31.260
OF THE VIOLATION WAS INADVERTENT

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:32.862
THE BUSINESS COOPERATED WITH THE

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:34.731
INVESTIGATION AND THE VIOLATION

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:36.065
WAS CORRECTED ONLY THOSE

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:37.667
CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD GIVE THE

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:38.768
AGENCIES THE DISCRETION TO LOWER

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:39.936
THOSE FINES BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:41.604
MANY OF THOSE FINES ARE FIXED IN

01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:42.105
STATUTE.

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:44.173
THE AGENCY IS DOING THE

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:44.874
INSPECTION ONCE THEY'VE

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:46.409

01:00:48.544 --> 01:00:53.349
IN SETTING THE FINES.

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:54.450

WHAT THEY DO AND AS A COST OF

01:05:44.307 --> 01:05:45.174
DOING BUSINESS?

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:46.509
RIGHT THAT INTO THEIR BOTTOM

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:48.811
LINE THEY'LL PAY A PENALTY IF IF

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:51.981
THEY GET CAUGHT -- IT'S

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:53.549
UNFORTUNATE THAT THERE ARE SOME

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:54.784
GOOD BUSINESSES THAT MIGHT GET

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:56.118
CAUGHT UP USING THE TROUBLE

01:05:56.185 --> 01:05:57.320
OBERNOLTE EXAMPLE.

01:05:57.386 --> 01:05:59.221
IN SITUATIONS THAT THEY MADE AN

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:02.158
HONEST MISTAKE BUT WE CAN'T --

01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:03.759
FORGET ABOUT THE VAST

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:04.894
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THAT IT

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.096
EXISTS IN THE STATE FULL OF BAD

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:10.466
EMPLOYERS AND FINALLY ALL SAY --

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:11.967
I CAN SPEAK MOST CULTURALLY

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:13.235
ABOUT CAL OSHA.

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:15.338
A CAL OSHA STAFF WHEN WE DO

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:16.772
REGULATIONS A CAL OSHA THEY ARE

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:18.507
ALSO THE SAME STAFFERS THERE IN

01:06:18.574 --> 01:06:19.675
THE FIELD.

01:06:19.742 --> 01:06:22.278
DOING INSPECTIONS SO.

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:23.079
SO.

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:24.814
TAKING MORE OF THEIR TIME OUT OF

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.249
THEIR WORK DAY TO TALK TO

01:06:27.316 --> 01:06:29.085
EMPLOYERS ABOUT WHETHER THEY

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:30.886
MEANT TO MAKE A MISTAKE WHETHER

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:32.188
THEY DIDN'T NEED TO MAKE A

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:32.455
MISTAKE.

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:33.723
AND FIGURING OUT.

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:38.828
WHAT IT MEANS IN THEIR MIND?

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:39.929
WELL WHETHER THEY SHOULD GET --

01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:40.830
NEXT FOR A FINE OR NOT TAKES

01:06:40.896 --> 01:06:43.666
THAT VITAL STEP AWAY FROM I'M

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:45.101
DOING THE WORK THEY NEED TO DO

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:45.968
IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:47.536
MAKING SURE BAD EMPLOYERS ARE

01:06:47.603 --> 01:06:48.704
HELD TO ACCOUNT.

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:51.140
SO THAT GOOD EMPLOYERS DON'T

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:52.408
HAVE TO COMPETE.

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:54.677
ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD -- TO

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:56.078
TO MAKE TO MAKE A LIVING THE

01:06:56.145 --> 01:06:57.213

THIS QUIRK SILVA.

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:55.638
OUR I EIGHT MOVE THIS BILL

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:58.541
FORWARD BECAUSE OF NOT ONLY THE

01:07:58.607 --> 01:08:00.709
MANY BUSINESSES THAT HAVE

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:01.844
APPROACHED ME.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.979
UP HERE -- IN THE STATE BUT ALSO

01:08:04.046 --> 01:08:05.514
IN MY DISTRICT JUST OVER SPRING

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:06.982
BREAK I HAD ABOUT TWELVE

01:08:07.049 --> 01:08:09.318
BUSINESSES VERY SMALL THAT CAME

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:11.587
IN TO SPEAK TO US ABOUT SOME OF

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:13.255
THESE EXAMPLES.

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:15.925
AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO OUR

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:18.494
TO LABOR FRIENDS I UNDERSTAND --

01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:20.796
THAT WE DO HAVE THE BATTLE PULLS

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:22.965
IN WHETHER IT'S IN TEACHING OR

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.667
CORPORATIONS OR THE MEDICAL

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:26.335
FIELD THERE'S ALWAYS A BAD

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:27.136
CHARACTER.

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:30.406
ON BUT I THINK THAT -- WHEN WE

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:32.942
WORK TOWARDS THE HIGHEST LEVEL

01:08:33.008 --> 01:08:34.777
INSTEAD OF THE LOWEST LEVEL WE

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:36.545
BRING EVERYBODY UP IN ONE OF THE

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:39.415
THINGS AND WE START TO LOOK AT --

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:41.717
LABOR AND EMPLOYERS IT'S GOT TO

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:43.385
BE A BALANCE THERE'S GOT TO BE A

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:44.820
BALANCE WITH EMPLOYER.

01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:46.655
AND EMPLOYEE AND WE WANT THEM

01:08:46.722 --> 01:08:51.327
ALL TO RISE AND LIKE I SAID.

01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:55.130
A NINETY FOUR YEAR OLD.

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:57.933
RESTAURANT OWNER IN FULLERTON --

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.536
EDDIE SHELDRICK WHO OWNS -- THE

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:02.004
POLIS PIES AND FULLER.

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:03.672
TEN II HE SAID YOU KNOW HE HAD A

01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:05.307
VIOLATION BECAUSE HE'S ONE OF

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:06.342
THE EMPLOYEES DIDN'T WEAR THE

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:08.444
RIGHT SHOES AND THAT AND ONCE

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:09.879
THAT START IT BECOMES LIKE A

01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:12.548
SNOWBALL EFFECT WHERE.

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:14.717
YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO SETTLE AND

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:15.951
THE YOU KNOW THEN THAT BECOMES

01:09:16.018 --> 01:09:17.586
OTHERS THAT ARE MAKING THE SAME

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:18.387
CLAIMS.

01:09:18.454 --> 01:09:21.390
AND IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING TO

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.225
SUPPORT OUR BUSINESSES AS BEEN

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:25.828
SAID MANY TIMES WHY DO THEY WANT

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:26.996
TO DO BUSINESS HERE IN THE STATE

01:09:27.062 --> 01:09:28.364

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:29.798
AND I JUST FEEL THAT WERE AT THE

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:33.335
TIPPING POINT OF IF LESS WE CAN

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:35.271
HAVE THAT SUPPORT OF EMPLOYEE

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:38.240
AND EMPLOYER -- WE'RE GOING TO

01:09:38.307 --> 01:09:39.608
KIND OF PUSH PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:42.044
BUSINESSES AND THAT DOES NOT

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.612
MEAN I DON'T RESPECT.

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:45.614
THE WORKERS RIGHTS AND SAFETY

01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:50.152

FRIENDS IN THE LABOR COMMITTEE

01:10:04.466 --> 01:10:06.201
RAISE SOME SOME FAIR INVALID

01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:07.436

MOVES FORWARD -- I DO HAVE

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:12.942
CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW THE BAD

01:10:13.008 --> 01:10:14.009
ACTORS AND IT'S VERY HARD TO

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:15.511
LEGISLATE AROUND THOSE SPECIFIC

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:17.146
SET OF FOLKS BUT I'M NOT UNLIKE

01:10:17.212 --> 01:10:18.847
MY COLLEAGUE I FIND CONSISTENTLY

01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:20.215
IN MY DISTRICT THAT FOLKS ARE

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:21.216
SAYING.

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:22.818
THE REGULATORY BURDENS AND THE

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:24.153
ABILITY JUST TO DEAL WITH THE

01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:25.754
REGULATORY PROCESS HAVE BECOME

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:27.289
SO CUMBERSOME THAT THE

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:28.190
CHALLENGES OF BEING A SMALL

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:29.825
BUSINESS OWNER ARE ALMOST TOO

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:31.093
MUCH FOR SO MANY PEOPLE AND WE

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:31.694
KNOW.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.195
HOW MANY FOLKS ARE EMPLOYED IN

01:10:33.262 --> 01:10:34.830
OUR SMALL BUSINESS SECTOR ACROSS

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:35.965
THE STATE SO AGAIN TO BE

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:37.066
CONSISTENT MAY GO AHEAD SUPPORT

01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:38.267
THE MEASURE TODAY I'M HOPEFUL

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:39.568
THAT AS WE MOVE ALONG OUR

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:41.770
FRIENDS CONCERNS -- FROM LABOR

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:45.741
CAN BE ACCOMMODATED IN AND WILL

01:10:45.808 --> 01:10:46.342
CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS THAT

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:47.443
THANK YOU.

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:51.080
ACCUSATION THAT THIS BILL --

01:10:51.146 --> 01:10:53.649
WOULD SHIELD THAT ACTORS AND I

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:55.084
DO NOT BELIEVE IN ANY.

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:56.318
WAY SHAPE OR FORM THAT WHEN YOU

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:58.053
HAVE A DISCRETIONARY BILL LIKE

01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.321
THIS.

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:00.689
THAT -- THAT IS VERY LIKELY TO

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:02.358

SPEAK TO THAT YOUR CLOTHES I

01:11:04.493 --> 01:11:07.429

SO AB I WOULD ALSO ECHO THE

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:10.366
COMMENTS OF OF SOME OF MY

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.101
COLLEAGUES I THINK WE ALL KNOW

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:13.402
THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:15.704
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO BUILDING

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:17.973
THRIVING COMMUNITIES TO CREATING

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.708
GOOD JOBS. FIVE IN BUILDING

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:22.544
STRONG CALIFORNIA ECONOMY.

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:23.579
I THINK ALL OF US I THINK

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:25.347
EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM WANTS TO

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:27.249
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:30.486
PROTECTING BAD ACTORS AND THAT.

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:32.087
HI BUT THAT WE'RE WRITING

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:34.356
POLICIES AND ESTABLISHING LIES

01:11:34.423 --> 01:11:35.157
THAT.

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:37.660
ENABLED THE GOOD BUSINESSES TO

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:39.862
THRIVE -- AND HELP WITH THAT FOR

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:42.531

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:46.268
BY THE OPPOSITION FOR ME.

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:49.738
I'M I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT I

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:50.539
THINK HAS BEEN.

01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:51.640
A VERY STRONG EFFORT ON YOUR

01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:52.975
PART TO KEEP THIS AS YOU SAID

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:55.310
VERY NARROWLY FOCUSED AND JUST

01:11:55.377 --> 01:11:56.111
LOOKING AT THAT THE BILL

01:11:56.178 --> 01:11:57.146
LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW SO IT

01:11:57.212 --> 01:11:58.681
SPECIFICALLY SAYS.

01:11:58.747 --> 01:11:59.782
THE VIOLATION BY THE SMALL

01:11:59.848 --> 01:12:01.216
BUSINESS BUSINESS DID NOT POSE

01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:03.118
AN IMMINENT HEALTH SAFETY OR

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:04.687
ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT.

01:12:04.753 --> 01:12:06.689
I AM SO WELL I THINK WE DO NEED

ENVIRONMENT WHERE.

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:14.596
GOOD SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CAN

GOOD JOBS FOR CALIFORNIA AS YOU

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:22.071
SAID. 97% OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS

01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:24.039
ARE WORKING FOR COMPANIES THAT

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:25.507

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:32.414

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:34.983
MOVES THROUGH THAT YOU CONTINUE.

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.318
TO ENGAGE WITH THE OPPOSITION

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:38.087

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:39.655

01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:44.460

WORKERS RIGHTS ARE AROUND

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:46.929

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.497
CERTAINLY DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:50.265
AND I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE

01:12:50.332 --> 01:12:51.433
SUPPORTING IT.

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:56.271

PERHAPS THIS MIGHT WEEKEND.

01:13:03.979 --> 01:13:06.982
WORKERS RIGHTS OR WORKER SAFETY.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:08.617
WE WERE VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:09.518
CRAFTED THE LANGUAGE IN THIS

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:11.453
BILL TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT THAT

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.322
WOULD NOT BE THE CASE STORE --

01:13:13.388 --> 01:13:15.390
IT AND WE ALSO I ABSOLUTELY DO

01:13:15.457 --> 01:13:16.759
NOT WANT TO PROVIDE A SHIELD FOR

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:18.160
A BAD ACTOR AND I I HOPE THAT

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.428
WE'VE DONE THAT BECAUSE THE BILL

01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:21.430
SAYS THAT THE VIOLATION FIRST OF

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:23.465
ALL HAS TO BE IN A BURDEN SO IF

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:24.666
IT WAS A WILLFUL VIOLATION.

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:26.769
WAS COMPANIES WOULD NOT QUALIFY

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:28.203
I SAYS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE A

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:29.571
FIRST TIME VIOLATORS SO IF

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:31.306
YOU'RE ONE OF THESE BAD ACTORS

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:32.441
THAT IS.

01:13:32.508 --> 01:13:34.209
A SUFFERING REPEAT VIOLATIONS

01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:35.778
YOU WOULD NOT QUALIFY ALSO IT'S

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.546
DISCRETIONARY SO DOES WE'RE NOT

01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:39.948
SAYING THAT ANY DEPARTMENT MUST

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:41.049
REDUCE OR MITIGATE THE FIGHTS

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:42.184
WE'RE JUST GIVING THEM.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:43.952
THE POWER TO REDUCE OR MITIGATE

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:45.087
THE FINES IN APPROPRIATE

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:46.755
CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE'RE TRUSTING

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:47.689
THAT THE DEPARTMENT IN THE

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:48.991
COURSE OF THEIR INVESTIGATION

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:50.425
WOULD DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:51.860
THESE VIOLATIONS WERE MINOR

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:53.262
DIDN'T IMPACT THE SAFETY OF THE

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:54.563

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:56.231
AND ONLY IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:13:56.298 --> 01:13:58.400
TAKE THAT THE STEP OF OF

01:13:58.467 --> 01:13:59.201
REDUCING OUR MITIGATING THE

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:00.002
