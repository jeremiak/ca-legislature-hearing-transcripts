00:32:19.003 --> 00:32:21.606
THAT YOU'VE CHANGED THAT- MY

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:23.207
BIGGEST CONCERN IS ENSURING

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:24.208
THAT AS WE'RE DOING THESE

00:32:24.275 --> 00:32:26.044
CONSERVANCIES WE KEEP TO THE

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.313
LOCAL CONTROL AND AS I SAID

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:31.549
BEFORE. ALLOWING A POSITION FOR

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:33.251
TRAVEL SUPPORT ALLOWING THESE

00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:35.520
OTHER POSITIONS I DO SEE AS

00:32:35.586 --> 00:32:38.690
IMPORTANT TOOLS. IN OUR

00:32:38.756 --> 00:32:40.692
IMPORTANT VOICES TO HAVE BUT I

00:32:40.758 --> 00:32:42.360

ABOUT IT NOT COMING FROM THAT

00:32:44.662 --> 00:32:46.464
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND I

00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:49.000
KNOW- THROUGH SOME OF THE

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:50.468

OPPOSITION THEY DO SHARE THAT

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:54.138
SAME OPINION SO WHY IS IT YOU

00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:58.976
FEEL SO INCLINED. TO NOT SET IT

00:32:59.043 --> 00:33:01.946
UP IN SUCH A WAY WITH THE LOCAL

00:33:02.013 --> 00:33:03.881
CONTROL CAN PICK THOSE PEOPLE

00:33:03.948 --> 00:33:08.319
