FOR INCARCERATED STUDENTS THROUGH SECOND CHANCE CAL GRANTS WHILE SUPPORTING EFFECTIVE REHABILITATE REHABILITATE EFFORTS WITHIN OUR CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS.

FIRST AUTHORIZED THOSE WERE INCARCERATED TO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE. PELL GRANTS BUT WERE UNFORTUNATELY BAND DURING THE TOUGH ON CRIME ERA. THE WHY IS CALIFORNIA NOT DOING THIS WHEN THE BENEFITS ARE CLEAR. STUDENTS WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN PARTICIPATING CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION HAVE A EVERY ONE DOLLAR INVESTED IN A CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS A RETURN OF FOUR TO FIVE DOLLARS. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY SPEND AN AVERAGE OF EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. INCARCERATING ONE INDIVIDUAL YET THE REVENUE NEEDED TO SUPPORT ONE FULL TIME COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT IS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. WELL EDUCATION ALONE DOES NOT SOLVE ALL OF THE ISSUES OF INCARCERATION AND RECIDIVISM IT IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT.

TO PROVIDE A STUDENT'S PARENT WITH A TRANSLATED COPY OF THE COMPLETED INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PLAN IN ONE OF THE EIGHT MOST COMMONLY SPOKEN LANGUAGES. IN THAT DISTRICT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF BEING REQUESTED. AS WELL AS REQUIRED THE I EP TO BE TRANSLATED BY A QUALIFIED TRANSLATOR. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES CD EITHER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO REVISE ITS NOTICE OF PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS IN ORDER TO INFORM PARENTS OF THEIR RIGHT TO REQUEST THE TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENTS. THE I EP PROCESS CAN BE VERY OVERWHELMING AND INTIMIDATING FOR SOMEONE WHO IS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS OR THE TERMINOLOGY. ESPECIALLY THAT PERSON'S PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH. THE LACK OF HAVING A TIMELY AND ACCURATELY TRANSLATED I EAT P. DOES A GREAT DISSERVICE TO BOTH THE PARENT AND THE STUDENT. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS FOR THE PARENTS TO HAVE MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION OF THE IEP PROCESS WHICH IS REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW BUT THIS BILL ALSO GOES ONE STEP FURTHER AND PROVIDES THAT PARENTS BE GIVEN A TRANSLATED COPY OF THE I.

THE BILL TWO OH SIX BY SENATOR SKINNER AN ACCOLADE INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS COM LONGER TO HAVE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU GOOD EVENING MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS SB TWO ZERO SIX GIVES CALIFORNIA'S COLLEGE ATHLETES THE SAME RIGHTS AS OLYMPIC ATHLETES. AND RIGHTS THAT ARE ENJOYED BY EVERY OTHER CALIFORNIA THE RIGHT TO ONE'S OWN NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS COLLEGE ATHLETES NOW HAVE TO WAIVE THAT RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN COLLEGE SPORTS ENFORCEMENT OF THAT RULE RESULTS IN ABSURDITY SUCH AS MEMBERS OF THE SWIM TEAM NOT BEING ALLOWED TO TEACH SWIMMING LESSONS. WE'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT ATHLETES LIKE UCLA'S ED O'BANNON MORE U. N. L. V.'S GREG ANTHONY AND BAN AND SAW HIMSELF FEATURED IN A BASKETBALL VIDEO GAME WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT OR SHARE OF THE PROFITS AND THIS WAS A YOUNG MAN WITH A STELLAR COLLEGIATE CAREER BUT A VERY SHORT PROFESSIONAL CAREER BECAUSE OF INJURIES SUSTAINED WHILE HE WAS IN COLLEGE. SB TWO OH SIX WOULD ALLOW COLLEGE ATHLETES TO MONETIZE THEIR YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND PURSUE SPONSORSHIPS AND ENDORSEMENTS SB TWO OH SIX DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT SCHOOLS PAID THEIR ATHLETES. ALSO SB TWO OH SIX PER BATES COLLEGE ATHLETES FROM SIGNING DEALS THAT UNDERMINE THEIR SCHOOLS EXISTING CONTRACTS. FEMALE COLLEGE ATHLETES TESTIFIED IN THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE COMMITTEES THAT THEY BELIEVE SB TWO OH SIX WOULD BE ESPECIALLY BENEFICIAL TO THEM WITH FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO GO PRO. COLLEGE MAY BE THE ONLY TIME THAT THESE FEMALE ATHLETES HAVE TO MONETIZE THEIR ATHLETIC SKILL. LET'S BE CLEAR. COLLEGE SPORTS IS A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY WITH THE NC DOUBLE A MEDIA COLLEGES COACHES IN ALL OTHERS MAKING MONEY OFF THE TALENT AND HARD WORK OF STUDENT ATHLETES. DESPITE WHAT MANY BELIEVE MOST COLLEGE ATHLETES DON'T RECEIVE FULL SCHOLARSHIPS IF YOU HAVE TIME FOR AN OUTSIDE JOB DUE TO SPENDING UP TO FORTY HOURS PER WEEK ON ATHLETICS WHICH IS THEIR JOB. CBSSPORTS PULLED ONE HUNDRED COLLEGE COACHES NATIONWIDE WHEN ASKED IF THEY SUPPORT ALLOWING COLLEGE ATHLETES TO THE RIGHT TO THEIR OWN NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS 77% SUPPORTED THIS. DANIEL BARGAIN FORMAL SEE FORMER C. O. O. OF THE NC DOUBLE A SUPPORTS SB TWO OH SIX SAYING THE MISTREATMENT OF STUDENT ATHLETES AS A LONG STANDING AND WELL KNOWN ISSUE THAT IS ATTRACTING NATIONWIDE ATTENTION. IMPLEMENTATION OF SB TWO OH SIX IS SET FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO GIVE SCHOOLS THE NC DOUBLE A OTHER STATES AND CONGRESS THE TIME TO ACT SO THAT ALL COLLEGE ATHLETES MIGHT GAIN THE RIGHTS PROVIDED BY SB TWO OH SIX. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS COME LONGER DOES MR LACKEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES LET ME JUST VALIDATE SOME OF THE REMARKS IT WAS JUST THE WERE JUST STATED I'M CLEARLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE ALSO. A CALIFORNIA COLLEGES THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT A STUDENT MAY DO WHAT THEIR TALENTS. EXCEPT FOR ONE. STUDENT ATHLETES. AN ORDERS CONSEILLER PAINTINGS. AN ENGINEER CAN DEVELOP ROBOTICS. SCIENTISTS CAN DEVELOP A MILLION DOLLAR APPLICATION. THE COLLEGE ATHLETE CAN'T CANNOT CANNOT HAVE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL. THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THE SCHOOLS TO PAY THE ATHLETES DIRECTLY INSTEAD THIS BILL GIVE STUDENT ATHLETES THE SAME RIGHTS AS OLYMPIC ATHLETES. ALLOWS ATHLETES TO MAKE MONEY FROM THEIR NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS. APPLE. ABOUT WHICH WILL ACTUALLY OBTAIN LARGE ENDORSEMENT DEALS AT GET MOSTLY ATTENTION LIKE NIKE AND GATORADE AND THE LIKE. MOST OF THESE ATHLETES UNDER THIS BILL WE USE IT TO MAKE EXTRA MONEY TO HOST CAPS FOR. YOUTH SUMMER PROGRAMS AND A VAST MAJORITY OF ATHLETES ARE NOT AS WAS STATED BY PREVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT ON A FULL SCHOLARSHIP. THESE ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF MAKING INCOME WILL HELP THE ATHLETES STAY IN SCHOOL. A PARTIAL SCHOLARSHIP ATHLETES MAKE ENDS MEET WITH TUITION FOOD BOOKS HOUSING RECEPTOR AND I WOULD ASK THAT YOU. SUPPORT THIS MEASURE FAIRNESS THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY MISTER PATTERSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MEMBERS THAT. MAN SPEAKER AND MEMBERS THANK YOU I WRI SADLY TO. INTERJECT A NOTE OF CAUTION HERE. AND I WANT TO SUGGEST FIRST OF ALL THAT I AM VERY SYMPATHETIC. OF WHAT THE ATTEMPT HERE IS. HOWEVER THERE IS A THERE IS A CIRCUMSTANCE HERE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THIS IS ABOUT. SOME UNIVERSITIES INCLUDING FRESNO STATE I WOULD SUGGEST SAN DIEGO STATE SAN JOSE STATE SACRAMENTO SAN LUIS OBISPO KALPANA EIGHT AND OTHERS. PUT US AT A VERY DFFICULT RECRUITING DISADVANTAGE. AND THE REASON THAT I ARE THESE UNIVERSITIES ARE CONCERNED AND HAVE RAISED THIS CONCERN WITH ME IS THAT ALL MARKET PLACES ARE NOT. EQUAL IN OTHER WORDS THE ATHLETES THAT ARE LOOKING AT FRESNO STATE PRESENTLY WILL NOT LOOK AT FRESNO STATE IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE OF THE MARKET FORCES THAT WILL BE WELL THAT WILL PLAY OUT IN THE BIG MARKETS AND IN IN A SAN FRANCISCO LA OTHER PLACES I DID NOTHING THINK ABOUT IT FOR JUST A MINUTE. IT IS THE RECRUITING LEVEL FIELD WE PRESENTLY HAVE ARE UNABLE STE FRESNO STATE QUITE FRANKLY TO BE COMPETITIVE WE WERE COMPETITIVE WE WITH U. S. C. NOT LONG AGO WE WERE COMPETITIVE WITH ABOUT. WITH THE MINNESOTA NOT LONG AGO. THE CONCERN THAT THAT OUR ATHLETIC DIRECTOR HANDS IS A SYMPATHY FORCE FOR STUDENTS. A HOPE THAT THE NC TWO WAY WILL WORK THROUGH THIS. BUT IN THE MEANTIME IF THERE IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT. FAIRNESS THAT IS ALLOCATED IN THIS THERE WILL BE A RECRUITING UP. BLOOM WITH SCHOOLS LIKE FRESNO STATE. I WANT TO REITERATE WHY WOULD THAT BE. IT WOULD BE BECAUSE THE VALUE OF BEING IN A BIG MARKET. IN A MEDIA MARKET. WILL BE A DISADVANTAGE TO FRESNO STATE IN ITS RECRUITING. THE CASE IS MADE THAT WELL. THE STUDENT ATHLETES WILL HELP YOU KNOW CLOSE THE GAP ON SOME OF THEIR EXPENSES AND THE LIKE IN A SMALLER VERSION OF A OF A FREE MARKET. THE FOR THE I THINK THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT IF A STUDENT ATHLETE FOR EXAMPLE WANTED TO BE. HIRED IN UTILIZED FOR A SPOKESPERSON FOR LET'S SAY A CAR DEALERSHIP. FRESNO HAS X. NUMBER OF CAR DEALERSHIPS THE MARKET PLACE ABOUT USC OR UCLA OR STANFORD OR OTHER PLACES WILL HAVE A HUGE SMS A STATISTICAL MEASURING AREA AND WILL HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES. THAT WILL GO TO STUDENTS EVEN FOR WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE THESE THESE SORT OF LESSER THINGS LIKE NIKE AND ARE UNDERNEATH THE BIG GAP. CONTRACTS THAT WOULD THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. AND I'M ASKING YOU TO THINK ABOUT IT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LAY OFF ON THIS. BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT THIS KIND OF CONSEQUENCE WHERE. UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS SOME DEGREE OF FAIRNESS IN RECRUITING. AND OUR RECRUITING IS SUCCESSFUL IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD REALLY FANTASTIC STUDENTS WHO HAVE COME TO US BECAUSE THEY CAN PLAY LIKE DEREK CARR AND FIND THEIR WAY. INTO BIG CONTRACTS IN THE NFL. OUR. EIGHTY OUR BULLDOG FOUNDATION AND OTHERS ARE VERY VERY CONCERNED THAT IF THIS WERE TO BE ESTABLISHED AS THE BILL SUGGESTS AN ABSENCE OF THE NC TO A AND IT. ENGAGING IN THIS AND RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS SOME FAIRNESS WITH RESPECT TO RECRUITING THAT I'VE JUST MENTIONED. I AM SYMPATHETIC TO THE STUDENTS I LAID OFF IN THIRTY SEVEN ANDERSON AND I'VE DONE A LOT OF HOMEWORK AND IT HAD TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE PICKING SOME WINNERS AND SOME LOSERS ACT AS A RESULT OF THE MARKET PLACES THAT THESE FOLKS NOW HAVE A CHOICE TO GO INTO. TO EARN BIG BOX IN BIG MARKET AND FRESNO AND OTHER SMALLER MARKETS WITH WITH COMPETITIVE FOOTBALL TEAMS IN SPORTS PROGRAMS I THINK WE'LL BE PUT IT ON THE NECESSARY DISADVANTAGE SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO LAY OFF I HOPE THAT THIS BILL GIVES SOME TIME FOR THE NC TWO EIGHT TO REALLY KIND OF COME TO ITS SENSES AND FRANKLY HELP. MAKE IT HAPPEN LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. APPRECIATE MEMBERS THANK YOU. MR KILEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO OH SIX. THE COUNTRY OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND STUDENTS PARTICIPATE IN INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS TENS OF THOUSANDS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. COLLEGE SPORTS ARE A CENTRAL PART OF UNIVERSITY LIFE AND NOT JUST FOR THE ATHLETES SPORTING EVENTS PROVIDE ENTERTAINMENT INSPIRE PRIDE AND FROM A COMMUNITY FOR STUDENTS ALUMNI SOMETIMES WHOLE CITIES. THIS IS TRUE EVEN THOUGH PROFESSIONAL LEAGUES EXIST FOR MOST OF THE TWENTY FOUR SPORTS OFFERED BY THE NCAA. THERE'S A DISTINCTIVE APPEAL TO INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE WORLD OF SPORTS AND OUR BROADER SOCIETY FOR HONORING THE ATHLETIC EXCELLENCE OF STUDENTS. THAT'S WHY NO LESS AUTHORITY THAN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS LONG SPOKEN OF THE REVERE TRADITION OF AMATEURISM. IN COLLEGE SPORTS. CONTRARY TO THE ASSERTIONS OF CRITICS TODAY'S BILL IT DOES NOT END THAT REVERED TRADITION OF AMATEURISM. IT DOESN'T INTRODUCED SALARIES FOR STUDENT ATHLETES IT IS NOT COMMODIFIED ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AS SUCH. RATHER SB TWO OH SIX RENEWS THIS PROUD AMERICAN TRADITION WITH A GREATER MEASURE OF RESPECT FOR THE STUDENT ATHLETE. SOMETHING THAT THE NCAA HAS REFUSED TO DO. AS NATIONAL INTEREST IN ITS PRODUCT HAS GROWN AND REVENUES HAVE SKYROCKETED THE NCAA HAS BARELY EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED THE TENSION INHERENT IN ITS BUSINESS MODEL. A HEAVILY COMMERCIALIZED ENTERPRISE WHOSE PRIMARY ATTRACTION THE STUDENT ATHLETES ARE PERMITTED IT FORBIDDEN FROM ANYTHING RESEMBLING COMMERCE OF THEIR OWN. IN FACT THE NCAA HAS MANAGED THIS TENSION IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY. THE MORE COMMERCIALIZED COLLEGE SPORTS TO BECOME THE MORE AGGRESSIVELY IT IS EXCLUDED STUDENT ATHLETES FROM ANY SHARE OF THE BENEFITS FORGET SHOE DEALS IN VIDEO GAMES AND CA ATHLETES CAN'T MAKE A LITTLE MONEY OVER THE SUMMER COACHING YOUTH SPORTS CAN'T PROMOTE THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA CAN'T MODEL ATHLETIC WEAR CAN'T ACCEPT GROCERIES OR HELP WITH RENT. OR EQUIPMENT CONSIDER ERIN EIGHT IN A TAUGHT BASEBALL RECRUIT WHO WAS BANNED FROM COMPETITION BECAUSE HE USED HIS NAME AND IMAGE TO PROMOTE AN INSPIRATIONAL BOOK HE WROTE ABOUT SURVIVING CANCER. OR THE YOU TALK BASKETBALL COACH WHO IS SAYING XIN FOR OCCASIONALLY BUYING PIZZA FOR PLAYERS OR THE OHIO STATE FOOTBALL PLAYERS WHO WERE DECLARED INELIGIBLE BECAUSE THEY COULD EXCHANGE TEAM PARAPHERNALIA THEY OWNED. FOR A DISCOUNT ON TASK TO TATTOOS. EARLIER THIS YEAR THE NCAA INITIALLY FOR BAIT MARYLAND STUDENTS FROM PROMOTING A FUNDRAISER HONORING A FORMER TEAMMATE WHO DIED TRAGICALLY DURING A TEAM WORK OUT. ONE PLAYER SAID AT THE TIME OUR TEAM IT PASSES AWAY DURING AN NCAA SANCTIONED WORK OUT. BUT NOW AS AN NCAA STUDENT ATHLETE I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PROMOTE A FUND RAISER WE'RE HAVING FOR HIS PARENTS FOUNDATION I CAN'T EVEN TWEET THE FLYER. WHEN A LINE IN THE SAND IS ENFORCED OBSESSIVELY EXCESSIVELY AND TO THE POINT OF ABSURDITY. THAT'S USUALLY A SIGN THAT IT DOESN'T BELONG THERE. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE. THIS DRACONIAN ENFORCEMENT AND THE OPPOSITION TO TODAY'S BILL ARE ABOUT PRESERVING NOT A TRADITION OF THEM AMATEURISM BUT ECONOMIC MONOPOLY. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE NCAA HAS OVERSTEPPED ITS ROLE AS GUARDIAN OF AMATEURISM TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE AMATEUR ATHLETES THEMSELVES. TODAY'S BILL IS A NEEDED CORRECTIVE PROVIDING NCAA LEADERS A CALL TO ACTION AND RESTORING TO STUDENT ATHLETES A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN NAME IMAGE AND LIKENESS THIS IS A UNIQUELY PERSONAL RIGHT AN EXTENSION OF ONE'S VERY PERSONHOOD AN INDIVIDUAL'S IDENTITY. IT'S FORCED TO SURRENDER IS UNUSUAL AND I'M JUST PLAYING COLLEGE SPORTS SHOULD NOT HAVETO COME AT THE COST OF PERSONAL LIBERTY DIGNITY SELF EXPRESSION OR ANY OTHER VALUE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE IS CHARGED WITH PROTECTING. SO LET'S PASS THIS BILL TODAY. WHAT DO SO UNANIMOUSLY WHAT SEND A LOUD AND CLEAR MESSAGE THE NCAA AND LET'S ALSO SEND A MESSAGE TO OUR TALENTED HARDWORKING AMAZING STUDENT ATHLETES TO OUR SKIERS AND SWIMMERS RUSTLERS AND ROWERS RUNNERS AND JUMPERS BOWLERS AND VOLLEY BALLERS SHOOTERS INVENTORS ARE INACTION OFFERS. TO THOSE THE PLAY SOCCER LACROSSE TENNIS WATER POLO AND FIELD HOCKEY YES IT DOES WE SEE ON TV COMPETING INSIDE ICE RINKS ACROSS DIAMONDS ATOP HARDWOOD IN BETWEEN PILOTS LET'S SEND A MESSAGE TO ALL OUR STUDENT ATHLETES THE CALIFORNIA HAS YOUR BACK I THINK THE SENATOR. FROM BERKELEY FOR TAKING ON THIS ISSUE AND I ASKED FOR AND I THAT. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY MISTER WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED YES MINUTES SPEAKER I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE S. B. TWO OH SIX UNLIKE SOME OTHER STUDENTS ATHLETES JUST CAN'T GAIN ANY INCOME FROM THEIR TALENT. MUSIC MUSIC PERFORMERS GET OUR MUSIC PROGRAM PEOPLE CAN GET MUSIC BAR OF MONEY FROM PERFORMING COMPUTER SCIENCES. STUDENTS CAN DEVELOP AN APT A FILM STUDENTS COULD MAKE A FILM BUT ONLY COLLEGE ATHLETES ARE BARRED I REALIZE THAT ALLOWING STUDENT ATHLETES TO EARN MONEY COMPLICATES THE CURRENT BALANCE OF POWER IN THE NC DOUBLE A- AND IT WILL OPEN THE DOOR FOR BOOSTERS AND WEALTHY DONORS TO RECRUIT. OR ENTICE OR HAVE IMPROVE IT HEAVEN FORBID PAY YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN TO COME TO THEIR FAVORITE SCHOOLS. AND THIS MAY GIVE SOME SCHOOLS AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. NOTE THAT IT LEE EIGHT OF THE LAST TEN NC DOUBLE A FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS WERE WON BY TWO TEAMS ALABAMA AND CLEMSON. THE CURRENT FREE FRAMEWORK IS NOT EXACTLY A PICTURE OF PARITY. WELL WELL NOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE NC DOUBLE A IS A ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY THEY CAN FIGURE IT OUT. MEMBERS SOME OF OUR MOST TALENTED STUDENT STUDENT MEN MEN AND MEN AND WOMEN STUDENTS ATHLETES ARE BEING ROBBED BY THE NC DOUBLE A- THIS BILL IS NOT THE ENTIRE SOLUTION BUT IT'S A GOOD BILL AND IT SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE THAT CALIFORNIA'S TIRED OF SEEING OUR YOUNG THAT. ATHLETES BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE BUT UP I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISTER WOULD. DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MADAM SPEAKER THE MEMBERS I TO RISE AS THEY PROUD CO AUTHOR OF SB TWO OH SIX. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I SPENT FORTY YEARS OF MY LIFE AT THE UNIVERSITY. AND DURING THAT TIME FRAME I HAD A LOT OF INTERACTION WITH STUDENT ATHLETES. AND WE SOMETIMES THINK THAT STUDENT ATHLETES LIVE IS REALLY WONDERFUL LIFE WITH THEY HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES pAND TO AND TO DO THE THINGS THAT THAT OTHER STUDENTS CAN'T DO. AND THE REALITY IS I'VE SEEN MORE STUDENT ATHLETES IN POVERTY. BARELY MAKING IT NOT ABLE TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY WORK SCHEDULE THE ATHLETIC SCHEDULE THAT THE ENGAGE IN. HAVING REAL LIMITATIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO HAVING TO WORK HARD IN THE SUMMER EVEN PRACTICING AND CAMPS. AND STILL NOT ABLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND THEY DON'T BENEFIT AT ALL. AT ALL FROM THERE FROM WHO THEY ARE FROM THE IMAGE OF THEM AND THEY HAVE NO VERY LITTLE RESOURCES THAT COME IN. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS REGARDING STUDENT ATHLETES HAVE BENEFITTED THE UNIVERSITIES. WHETHER IT'S OF BEING ON TELEVISION OR HAVING CERTAIN KINDS OF SWAG THAT PEOPLE CAN BY THE NAMES OF ATHLETES. THOSE THINGS BENEFIT THE UNIVERSITY AND THEY HAVE MADE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND THOSE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DO NOT ALWAYS GO BACK INTO THOSE ATHLETES. THEY HAVE GIVEN MUCH OF THEIR LIVES SOME OF THEM DON'T GO PRO I'VE HAD PROBABLY VERY FEW STUDENTS. TO ACTUALLY WILL BECOME PRO ATHLETES OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS I DON'T THINK I'VE HAD FORTY STUDENTS WILL BECOME PRO ATHLETES IN A FORTY YEAR CAREER. BECAUSE THEY DON'T. BUT THAT NONE THE LESS THEY MAKE THE SCHOOL GREAT. THEY WORK HARD THEY DO ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND THEY DON'T BENEFIT NECESSARY FROM THE MONEY THAT COMES IN. AND IT'S A TRAGEDY THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN USE AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT. THINGS THEY TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF RECRUITMENT AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. OUR ATHLETES ARE OFTEN USE THAT OUR UNIVERSITIES TO CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO DO OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT IS SO WE SENT TO THAT THE UNIVERSITY BELIEVES IN TERMS OF ITS IMAGE. SO I REALLY AM VERY PLEASE WITH THIS I'M GLAD THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE BERKELEY. THIS. I TO INTRODUCE ISRAEL. IT IS A MAJOR PIECE IF YOU BEEN READING ANY OF THE BLOGS WITH REGARDS TO THE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES WHO SPENT. TIME IT ON CAMPUSES YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE ALL IN SUPPORT OF IT SB TWO OH SIX. BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AS ATHLETES AND EVEN THOUGH THEY BECAME% PROFESSIONALS. MANY OF THEIR FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES DID NOT. AND AS A RESULT THEY DESERVE TO HAVE. THIS SOME JUSTICE AND HAVE SOME PARTICIPATION IN CONTROL OF THEIR OWN LIFE. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I WILL FOR SB TWO OH SIX. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISS COME OVER TO HAVE YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK MY- COLLEAGUES FROM FRESNO EL DORADO SAN DIEGO. THE NORTH COAST NOT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT NOT SO MANY PEOPLE WERE INTERESTED IN THIS BILL. RIGHT I WHAT I WANT TO CLOSE THAT WAS A JOKE THAT WASN'T TOO I ACTUALLY WANT TO CLOSE WITH THE STORY OF GREG ANTHONY SO GREG ANTHONY I WAS ONE OF THE RUNNING REBELS HE PLAYED AT U. N. L. V. I THINK IT WAS IN THE NINETIES HE WAS A STAR POINT GUARD. HE ALSO ATTENDED THE WORLD ECONOMIC SUMMIT AND LO AND BEHOLD. HE INTERNED ON CAPITOL HILL FOR A REPUBLICAN. HE HAD A VISION FOR HIS FUTURE. WHILE HE ATTENDED U. N. L. V. HE ALSO WORKED IN TRIED TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY HIS MOTHER HAD UNDER UNDERGONE SURGERY FOR CANCER AND HIS SISTER WAS A HEMOPHILIAC. SO HE CREATED A TEE SHIRT BUSINESS WITH A COUPLE OF HIS COLLEAGUES. SO THAT HE COULD PAY HIS OWN TUITION AND NOT BE DEPENDENT ON THE SCHOLARSHIPS. HE DID NOT WANT THEM. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. LET ME TELL YOU THE NC DOUBLE A STEPPED IN AND SAID OH NO GREG ANTHONY NOT YOU. THEIR RESPONSE WAS GIVE UP YOUR BUSINESS ENTIRELY GIVE UP SELLING THESE T. SHIRTS TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR SISTER ARE OKAY OR YOU MUST RECUSE YOURSELF FROM THE GAME AND STOP PLAYING ENTIRELY. THAT WAS THEIR RESPONSE. IT'S LIKE A CARTEL PROPOSITION. MADE BY THE NC DOUBLE A. WHO WELL WHO HAS CONTINUED TO MAKE BILLIONS WITH THE BE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THE BACKS OF YOUNG ATHLETES. AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SAY BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE IS THAT MANY OF THESE YOUNG ATHLETES WHO ARE EARNING TOP TOP DOLLAR FOR THE NC DOUBLE A OUR YOUNG BLACK MEN. AND WE KNOW. THAT BLACK PEOPLE IN THE USE OF THEIR LABOR FOR FREE HAS BEEN INGRAINED IN THE FABRIC OF THIS COUNTRY. THIS BILL IS TURNING AND IDEA THAT IDEA THAT HAS BEEN IN BED IT. AND IS PRETTY UNSHAKEABLE. INTO A NEW IDEA THAT SAYS THESE ATHLETES DESERVE COMPENSATION. SO THAT THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO CONDITIONAL SCHOLARSHIPS THAT SAY I'LL GIVE YOU THE SCHOLARSHIP IF YOU SHOW UP FOR WORK IF YOU SHOW UP FOR PRACTICE IF YOU PERFORM ON THE BASKETBALL COURT OR WHATEVER OTHER ATHLETIC COURT THERE IS. BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING A JOB LIKE ED O'BANNON SAID. AND I JUST WANNA SAY IN SEE DOUBLE WAY. DON'T THREATEN CALIFORNIA. DON'T THREATEN US BECAUSE WE HAVE FORMIDABLE SCHOOLS WE HAVE FORMIDABLE ALUMNI WE HAVE FORMIDABLE VIEWERSHIP AND WE CAN LEVERAGE THOSE THINGS UP UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHEN THIS BILL TAKES A FACT. BUT I'M SICK OF BEING LEVERAGED BY THE NC DOUBLE A ON THE BACKS OF ATHLETES WHO HAVE THE RIGHT. TO THEIR OWN LIKENESS AN IMAGE THIS IS ABOUT FAIRNESS.

EXTREME WEATHER HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN THE LENGTH OF THE WILDFIRE SEASON ACCORDING TO CAL FIRE TWELVE OR THE CALIFORNIA FIRES. BUT WILD FIRES WERE RECENTLY BECAUSE BY ELECTRICAL POWER DISTRIBUTION LINES CAL FIRE STUDY TREES ARE PARTS OF TREES FALLING ON THE POWER LINES AS SPECIFIC CAUSE OF THE FIRE. EXISTING LAW REQUIRES UTILITIES TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM COME CLEARANCES BETWEEN VEGETATION ELECTRIC LINES REMOVE DEAD AND DYING TREES THAT COULD FALL ON LINES RECENT EVENTS HAVE SHOWN THAT UTILITY SELF AUDITING OF THEIR OWN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT DOESN'T WORK. RECENTLY THE JUDGE OVERSEEING P. GENIES PROBATION IN THE SAN BRUNO CASE SAID P. JEANNIE HASN'T CUT THE RIGHT TREES IN MANAGING VEGETATION IN AND NEAR ITS POWER LINES UTILITIES NEED OUTSIDE AUDITS FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. SB TWO FORTY SEVEN WILL REQUIRE THE NEW WILD FIRE SAFETY DIVISION CREATED BY AB ONE ELEVEN TWO I DID TAKE AUDIT EACH UTILITIES VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK THE AUDIT WOULD IDENTIFY YOU FAILURES TO COMPLY WITH VEGETATION MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS IN ITS WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN AND UTILITY WOULD HAVE TO CORRECT THOSE DEFICIENCIES. IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT TREE TRIMMING IS VERY DANGEROUS WORK SB TWO FORTY SEVEN WERE ALSO REQUIRE A MINIMUM WORKFORCE WORK FORCE PERFORMING THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK.

CLERK WILL CLOSE THE ROLLING TALLY THE VOTE AYE AYES FORTY FIVE NEWS HERE IS MEASURE PASSES. MOVING TO FILE ITEM TO NINETY EIGHT SB TWO SIXTY EIGHT THE CLERK WILL READ SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY EIGHT BY CENTER WE'RE ACTUALLY TWO ELECTIONS. MR STONE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND AN MEMBERS CURRENT LAW WHEN IT COMES TO PUTTING A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT A BOND OR A TAX HAS REQUIRES THAT WE PUT A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION IN THE SEVENTY FIVE WORDS STATEMENTS. THE RECENT LAW THAT THAT HAD BEEN PASSED THAT IS PUSHING TRYING TO PUSH TOWARDS WAR TRANSPARENCY WAS WAS A GOOD TRY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REQUIREMENT TO PUT SO MUCH INFORMATION IN THAT SEVENTY FIVE WORDS STATEMENT. IT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IT WITHOUT REALLY MISLEADING PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THAT STATEMENT IS. WHAT SENATOR WAITERS BILL SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY EIGHT DOES IS CLEAN THIS UP BY ENSURING THAT IN THAT SEVENTY FIVE WOULD STATEMENT WE ARE POINTING TO EXACTLY WHERE A- PROPERTY OWNER TAXPAYER CAN FIND THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED. CALCULATE WHAT THE IMPACT IS ON THEM. BY NOT PUTTING A OVERLY SIMPLIFIED STATEMENT WITHIN THE SEVENTY FIVE WORDS THAT THEN BECOMES MISLEADING. SIMPLE TAXES LIKE A. SIMPLE SALES TAX INCREASE PRETTY EASY TO UNDERSTAND PARCEL TAX WHERE YOU MAY HAVE EXEMPTIONS TAXES THAT ARE TIERED WHICH ARE FAVORED WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME COMPLICATED WAY OF TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT. FOR EXEMPTING SENIORS OR EXEMPTING DISABLED IS EXEMPTING OTHERS FROM THE TAX CAN'T BE CAPTURED IN THAT ONE SIMPLE STATEMENT THIS BILL IT CLEANS UP THAT EXISTING LAW PROVIDES FOR TRANSPARENCY AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER SINISTER OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS ARE ALWAYS IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO SB TWO SIXTY EIGHT I HAVE A LONG HISTORY WITH THIS AREA OF THE STATE CODE. FOUR YEARS AGO I AUTHORED AB EIGHT OH NINE WHICH CREATES THE REQUIREMENT THAT TAX INCREASES THAT VOTERS VOTE ON MUST INCLUDE ON THE BALLOT LABEL RIGHT WHERE YOU VOTE. THE FACT THAT IT'S A TAX INCREASE AND THE RATE AND DURATION OF THE TAX. TWO YEARS AGO I AUTHORED AB ONE NINETY FIVE WHICH CLARIFIES THAT THAT REQUIREMENT EXTENDS TO BONDS IF THEY INCREASE PROPERTY TAXES TO REPAIR THOSE BONDS. THOSE BILLS PASSED WITH BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS CHAMBER VOTED FOR THEM. FOR EXAMPLE QUESTIONS HAVE ARISEN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IF A BOND DOESN'T HAVE A FIXED DURATION WHATEVER HAPPENS OF A BOND DOESN'T HAVE A FIXED INTEREST RATE. HOW SHOULD THAT BE HANDLED RIGHT NOW THEY JUST USE ESTIMATES. I HAVE TRIED COLLEAGUES OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. TWO DIFFERENT BILLS TO TRYING CLEAN THIS UP BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL REFUSED TO NEGOTIATE BECAUSE WHAT THEY REALLY WANT. IS TO HIDE FROM VOTERS THE FACT THAT THEY'RE VOTING ON A TAX INCREASE AND IN FACT THE BILL IN FRONT OF YOU WOULD REMOVE COMPLETELY OF THE REQUIREMENT. THAT THE TO DO THAT THE TAX INCREASE BIZ MENTIONED ON THE BALLOT STATEMENT AND INSTEAD JUST INSERT THE WORDS. SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR INFORMATION AND WE ALL KNOW THAT MOST VOTERS NEVER OPEN THE VOTER GUIDE SO THAT IS ESSENTIALLY HIDING FOR VOTERS THE FACT THAT THEY'RE VOTING ON A TAX INCREASE. I AND IF YOU WANT PROOF OF THE BAD FAITH THAT THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL HAVE SHOWN JUST LOOK AT THE- TRANSCRIPTS OF THE COMMITTEE HEARING THAT THIS BILL WAS HEARD IN. A WE OFFERED A COMPROMISE. THAT SAID OKAY WE'LL JUST SAY THIS. THIS MEASURE INCREASES PROPERTY TAXES AND SEE VOTER GUIDE. AND THEY REJECTED IT BECAUSE WHAT THEY REALLY WANT TO DO IS HIDE THE FACT IT'S A TAX INCREASE BUT LOOK DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT. EDITORIAL BOARDS OF ALL POLITICAL STRIPES UP AND DOWN THE STATE HAVE WEIGHED IN ON THIS MEASURE. I DON'T LIKE TO SHARE THOSE WORDS WITH YOU OR WITH YOUR PERMISSION TO READ MISTER SPEAKER. WITHOUT OBJECTION. SO HERE'S THE LA TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD IF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE WORRIED THAT THEY CAN'T SELL VOTERS ON COMPLICATED NEW TAX SCHEMES AND SEVENTY FIVE WORDS OR LESS. THAN THEY NEED TO WORK ON THEIR COMMUNICATION SKILLS. HERE'S THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE POLITICIANS GIVE VOTERS A DOUBLE DOSE OF SNEAKING THIS. ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER GIVEN THEIR DRUTHERS MANY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WOULD PREFER TO DO THEIR BUSINESS OUR BUSINESS ACTUALLY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. AND PROVIDE SANITIZED SO SERVING VERSIONS OF THEIR ACTIONS AFTER THE FACT. NEWS GROUP EDITORIAL BOARD THIS BILL IS A CYNICAL PLOY INTENDED TO INCREASE THE CHANCES OF PASSAGE BY KEEPING VOTERS IN THE DARK. CAL MATTERS A NEW LAW THAT PURPORTS TO GIVE VOTERS VITAL INFORMATION ABOUT TAX AND BOND MEASURES BUT INSURERS THAT THE DATA WILL BE BURIED IN OFFICIAL PAPERWORK IN THAT FAILURE TO PROVIDE IT. WILL BE PENALIZED. I AM FINE THE SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS A NEEDS TO FAIL BAY TIMES EDITORIAL BOARDS. THE DECEIT OF THE BOND LOBBY AND ITS ALLIES IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS DESPICABLE. I COLLEAGUES ONE MORE POINT THAT I LIKE TO MAKE ABOUT THIS IS THAT THIS IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY I LOOKED OVER THE LAST TWO YEAR ELECTION CYCLE AT ALL OF THE BOND MEASURE STATEWIDE. THERE WERE ON BALLOTS THAT COMPLIED WITH THE EXISTING LANGUAGE. YOU WITH THE PASSAGE RATE WAS OVER EIGHTY TWO PERCENT. SO IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT VOTERS ARE NOT CONFUSED SO I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE OR IF YOU CAN'T GET THERE RIGHT NOW MEMBERS. I REQUEST THAT YOU JUST MERELY LAY OFF ON THIS AND IF THIS BILL DOES NOT PASSED TODAY. HI WILL CERTAINLY REINTRODUCE LEGISLATION IN JANUARY. TO TRY AND CLARIFY SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND HOPEFULLY THIS TIME THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WERE WORK WITH ME INSTEAD OF WORKING AROUND. A DECREASING VOTER TRANSPARENCY BUT I WILL CERTAINLY NOT VOTE. TO KEEP VOTERS IN THE DARK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE VOTING ON A TAX INCREASE AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU I ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISTER STONE YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU. UNFORTUNATELY BY JUST PUTTING A BLANK STATEMENT ON WITHIN THAT SEVENTY FIVE WORDS THAT THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE YOUR TAXES. IS IN FACT MISLEADING. A RENTER ISN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO BE PAYING THE PROPERTY TAX AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS EXEMPTED IN A TIERED SYSTEM. IS NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE PAYING THE PROPERTY TAX IF WE PUT THAT STATEMENT THERE. THAT IS I THINK INTENDED TO BE MISLEADING TO SCARE PEOPLE IN VOTING NO. ON A MEASURE THAT WOULD. ACTUALLY BE TO THEIR BENEFIT THAT THEY MAY NOT BE PAYING. THIS IS NOT THAT SIMPLE TO DO TO START TO SING TO ME. TO THINK THAT THERE'S A CRITICISM OF LAYING OUT. IN THE VOTER GUIDE. EXACTLY HOW A- PROPERTY OWNER OR A TAXPAYER CAN CALCULATE FOR THEMSELVES WHAT THEIR TAX MAY OR MAY NOT BE. IS MISLEADING WHAT'S MISLEADING IS TRYING TO FORCE JURISDICTIONS IN PUTTING. AN OVERLY SIMPLIFIED STATEMENT IN THAT SEVENTY FIVE WORDS THAT IS GOING TO LEAD A VOTER TO THE WRONG CONCLUSION. BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED. AND EACH VOTERS ARE GOING TO BE IN A POTENTIALLY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCE WITHOUT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS THOSE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE.
