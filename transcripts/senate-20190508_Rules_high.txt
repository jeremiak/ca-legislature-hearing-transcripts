THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU MR TOE CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE COMMISSION IN HERE -- NOMINATION TO CONTINUE I ALSO WANNA IN KNOWLEDGE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PUBLIC SERVICE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I BELIEVE PHILA LAW ENFORCEMENT POSITION. IN THE COMMISSION THANK YOU SENATOR. IN WE YOU SHARED A LOT IN OUR CONVERSATION -- YESTERDAY AND I APPRECIATED YOUR TAKING THE TIME. A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT I THINK WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO OUR COMMITTEE. WHICH IS THE QUESTION OF THE PROSPECT OF ONLINE SPORTS BETTING IN CALIFORNIA IN HOMES NOT NEAR PURVIEW TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT. THAT IS LEGALIZED I DID ASK YOU WHAT YOU FELT THE CAPACITY WAS OF THE COMMISSION. TO OVERSEE THAT SHOULD. SHOULD IT BE LEGALIZED AT SOME POINT IN MAYBE YOU COULD SHARE SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR -- AS A COMMISSION IF THE LEGISLATURE -- DECIDE THAT -- THE COMMISSION -- WILL BE THE AGENCY TO CREATE -- REGULAR REGULATIONS AS A REGULATORY BODY. WE ARE ABLE AND WILLING. TO SIT DOWN WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND OR PINIONS AND WITHIN OUR EXPERTISE BECAUSE I KNOW OUR STAFF IS. TREMENDOUS SHOULD THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS EXPERTISE -- GREAT LEADERSHIP AND WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING EVER SINCE -- THE CITRIX SUPREME COURT A LAST YEAR A MAKE THAT RULING -- TO PROHIBIT A SPORTS BETTING OF DEPEND ON THE STATE. AND SO -- WITH THAT ALL THOUGHTS IS -- THERE'S MANY CONSIDERATION THAT -- I BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE -- WOULD HAVE -- TO CONSIDER -- WHO CAN WHO CAN OFFER SPORTS BETTING? HOW'S THE APPLICATION PROCESS GONNA GO -- WHO WILL HAVE OF COMPLIANCE -- AND BACKGROUND -- ASPECT OF THAT WILL BE -- THE BARREL OF CAMERA CONTROL -- WHAT KIND OF SPORTS BETTING OF CAN WE WOULD -- YOU NEED TO CONSIDER -- WOULD IT BE -- SOMETHING TO CONSIDER OF SPORTS BETTING IS WOULD BE -- REAL LIVE -- AS IT'S HAPPENING I CAN'T THINK OF THE WORD BUT IT'LL ALERT FOR INSTANCE -- FOOTBALL GAME -- CAN. SHOULD WE CONSIDER ALLOW. BEDDING -- TO OCCUR DURING THE GAMES -- HAVE TIME AFTER HALFTIME THE SECOND HALF WOULD WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED -- THE TAX -- SCHEDULE. HOW WOULD THAT BE SO THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT THE THE THE LEGISLATURE -- SHOULD CONSIDER -- AND WE WOULD BE. ORDER HAPPY -- TO TO GIVE OUR EX EXPERTISE OPINION AND AND WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND AGAIN WHILE I KNOW THAT'S NOT BEFORE YOU AT THIS MOMENT -- I JUST FOUND YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN. THE EXPANSIVE CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE WOULD WANT -- TO HAVE BEFORE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THEN -- YOU REFERENCED I NOTES THE BUREAU OF ENFORCEMENT THAT'S IN CHARGE OF ENFORCEMENT MATTERS THE COMMISSION REVIEWS. CITATIONS SIR LICENSE ISSUES. WE ALSO SPOKE OF THE THE INDIAN CASINOS THE COMPAQ'S. AND HOW THEY ARE IN CHARGE OF THEIR OWN LICENSING OF A CERTAIN LEVEL OF EMPLOYEES AND IT'S ONLY AT CERTAIN LEVELS FOR THE COMMISSION HAS OVERSIGHT AND ONE OF YOU TO SHARE BRIEFLY. THAT DISTINCTION AND WHETHER YOU THINK THERE ARE ANY CONCERNS OF MAYBE LATERAL TRANSFERS BETWEEN DIFFERENT -- CASINO GAMING FACILITIES THAT MAYBE SOMEBODY'S BEEN TERMINATED AT ONE BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN FRONT OF YOUR COMMISSION. THAT WOULD GIVE RISE TO REVIEW TO WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE. SURE THANK YOU -- SENATOR -- THE PAYROLL -- AND OUR COMMISSION HAS A VERY LIMITED -- INVOLVEMENT WITH THE THE TRIBAL -- BECAUSE EVERY TRIBAL HAS THEIR OWN GAMING COMMISSION. AND THEY ARE IN CHARGE -- AND HAS THE UTHORITY TO HIRE -- EVERY TO EVERY -- OF THEIR EMPLOYEES EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES THEY THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY -- THE ONLY TIME ONE AND OF COURSE THERE ARE -- APPLIANCE AND INVESTIGATIVE UNITS WOULD DO BACKGROUND CONDUCT BACKGROUNDS -- ON THOSE INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY HIRE. AND THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GRANT LICENSES -- TO IN VISUAL DATA IF THEY DEEM TO TO BE SUITABLE -- THE ONLY TIME WHEN. THE STATE WHEN WE GET INVOLVED AND THAT. pPROMOTION TO A SUPERVISORY POSITION WHICH WE CALL IT THE KEY EMPLOYEE POSITION. AND THEN THAT APPLICANT. IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT -- STATE APPLICATION AND THAT'S WHEN THE COMMISSION -- BECOMES INVOLVED NOW. KEEP IN MIND THAT THE BOY HE HAS ALREADY BEEN LICENSED BY THE THE TRIBAL CASINO -- BUT WE AS A NEGOTIATING A COMPACT -- WELL THE TROUBLE NEGOTIATED COMPACT -- WE TWO OF THE THE THE THE MERYL WILL CONDUCT -- BACKGROUNDS ON THAT INDIVIDUAL FOR KEY EMPLOYEE POSITION -- WE WITH FIGHTING ONLY THAT WE WOULD FIND A SUITABLE. WHETHER THAT EMPLOYEE IS SUITABLE OR NOT NOT TO GRANT A LICENSE -- THAT'S UP -- TO THE TRIBAL CASINO ABOUT HIMSELF HOWEVER THIS IS A A A A DISTINCTION BETWEEN -- A TRIBAL MEMBER. AND A NON TRIBAL MEMBERS -- WHEN WE FIND -- THE PERSON IS SUITABLE OR NOT. IF IT IF THAT POOR EMPLOYEE IS A TRIBAL MEMBER. THE THE THE TROUBLE IS NOT. BUYING INTO A TWO OF TECH ALL RECOMMENDATION. DATE BECAUSE OF THE NEGOTIATING COMBAT THEY CAN HIRE -- THEY CAN FALL GO ALL RECOMMENDATION WHETHER WE ARE IF IT'S IF WE SHE SAID DENY THAT PERSON IS SUITABLE. TO THE TRIBAL CAUGHT THE TRIBAL CAN -- HIGHER THAT THE POLICE A REGARDLESS OF WHAT. NOW IT'S DIFFERENT WITH THE NON TRIBAL MEMBER. AT ONCE THE THE SUITABILITY IS FOUNDED -- WELL WE DENY THAT PERSON. THEN THE TRIBAL CASINO HAS TO TERMINATE. THAT EMPLOYEE. SO THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AND THAT'S A PROBLEM THE ONLY TIME WHEN WE GET INVOLVED IN -- BUT THE TRIBAL.

A MAN DIRECTOR CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU. YOU KNOW IN AN EARLIER LIFE -- OF MINE IN THIS HOUSE I HAD RESPONSIBILITY -- FOR OVERSIGHT OVER -- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS -- INCLUDING THE CONTROLLERS PROJECT -- HAVING TO DO WITH THE PAYROLL SYSTEM AND AND THE LIKE FOR OUR CALIFORNIA POLICE. AND DURING THAT -- OVERSIGHT EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD A AS I RECALL ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS IDENTIFIED WAS THE IN TERMS OF AN EXPLANATION FOR WHY THE PROJECT WAS SO HARD. WAS THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR PAY SYSTEMS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PAY THAT PEOPLE RECEIVE. OVER STATE GOVERNMENT THAT MADE IT VERY VERY COMPLICATED. AND I I KNOW THAT YOU WERE IN IN IN BURKE IN AN EFFORT. TO ELIMINATE OBSOLETE CLASSIFICATIONS TO SIMPLIFY CLASSIFICATINS. AND IN OTHER WORDS TO MAKE OUR CALIFORNIA SYSTEM PERHAPS INCLUDING HOPEFULLY OUR PAY SYSTEM. A LITTLE EASIER TO DEAL WITH HOW ARE YOU HOW ARE YOU COMING WITH THAT EFFORT THAT VERY IMPORTANT EFFORT. ACTUALLY -- CALLIE CHAR HAS HAD MUCH SUCCESS WITH THE CLASS CONSOLIDATION PROJECT. OUR BIGGEST PROJECT WITH THE I. T. CONSOLIDATION THAT WE DID BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHAT WE TOOK ABOUT TWENTY CLASSIFICATIONS AND BROUGHT THEM DOWN THE NIGHT -- WE ARE ALSO WORKING -- IN THE CLASS CONSOLIDATION CURRENTLY FOR THE GENERAL THIS CLASSIFICATION WHICH WILL PROBABLY AFFECT ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND A STATE EMPLOYEES BRING IT ABOUT THIRTY FIVE CLASSIFICATIONS DOWN TO ABOUT -- EIGHTEEN SO WE ARE DILIGENTLY WORKING ON THAT PROJECT -- IT IS CONSTANTLY MOVING AND IT'S DOING ACTUALLY VERY WELL. EXCELLENT. I ALSO NOTED IN THE REVIEW OF THE MATERIAL THAT WE WERE PROVIDED THAT YOU ARE EMBARKED ON AN EFFORT TO FIELD. ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECT TO TRACK DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT CLAIMS. OR COMPLAINTS AND HOW IS THAT GOING. ACTUALLY THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING. YOU WILL TOO THE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT TRACKING SYSTEM PROJECT -- WE ARE LOOKING TO COMPLETE THAT PROJECT BY JULY. TWENTY NINETEEN OF AT THAT TIME FROM THERE WILL BE TRAINING DEPARTMENTS WHEN THE SYSTEM AND WE WILL BE ENTERING. INFORMATION INTO THE SYSTEM JANUARY. TWENTY TWENTY SO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT -- OCCASIONALLY. A WAS IDENTIFIED DURING THE VARIOUS IT PROJECTS THAT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE HERE. I HAD TO DO WAS ON BOARDING OF OF STAFF AND EMPLOYEES ARE YOU -- MAYBE YOU ANSWERED THIS IN YOUR LAST STATEMENT BUT ARE YOU IN TE PROCESS OF OF OF DOING THE ON BOARDING NOW GETTING THE STAFF READY. TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY WHEN THE SYSTEM GOES LIVE AT THAT WON'T START TILL JULY AUGUST. FOR THE ON BOARDING FOR THE DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT TRACKING SEX ON WHY I LOOK FORWARD -- TO HEARING REPORTS ON HOW THAT GOES IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING WELL IN HAND AND YOUR QUALIFICATIONS ARE SUPERB AND ONCE AGAIN AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING YOUR CONFIRMATION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU ON NEWS JANE CAN. SO WE HAD SUCH A GOOD CONVERSATION WHEN YOU'RE IN MY OFFICE I THINK THAT I'M NOT GONNA HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU YOU HAVE A A SUPERB. RESUME AND CERTAINLY ON THE QUESTIONS I ASKED FOCUSED ON THE RETIREMENT WAVE -- THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED-FACE THAT AND NOT SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS THAT I'VE HAD YOU HAVE THAT TO A CERTAIN THE RECRUITMENT. FOCUSED ON OUT SO I'M I'M VERY COMFORTABLE TO CONGRATULATE YOU AND BE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR NOMINATION WE HAVE A VOTE THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ALSO ON OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ONE THING I GLEANED FROM OUR CONVERSATION. WE HAVE MANY HEROES IN AMERICAN INDUSTRY WHO STARTED IN THE MAIL ROOM AND YOU SHARED WITH ME. THAT YOU ALSO STARTED IN THE MAIL ROOM AND LOOK LOOK WHERE YOU HAVE ENDED UP A LOT OF HARD WORK AND COMMITMENT AND I IMAGINE FAMILY SUPPORT. AS WELL ALONG THE WAY -- I JUST WANT TO ASK A QUESTION THAT -- WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY BECAUSE I THINK THE COMMITTEE WOULD FIND IT OF INTEREST. THE CHALLENGE OF PAY EQUITY -- ENDS. GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN PAY EQUITY -- WITH STATE JOBS I THINK MY BELIEF WAS WELL IF YOU HAVE A JOB CLASSIFICATION. ANYONE WITHIN THAT CLASSIFICATION WOULD RECEIVE THE SAME COMPENSATION BUT YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT AND YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. HELL WORK IS VALUED IN DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD JUST SHARE A LITTLE OF THAT WITH THE COMEDIAN. YOUR THOUGHTS OF HOW. WE DO TAKE THAT ON AND IT SOUNDED A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGING IN A LITTLE MORE COMPLEX THAN I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT AT THE OUTSET YEAH -- IN OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY -- THE GENDER PAY GAP IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT COMPLEX FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE SALARIES ARE SET -- AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH GENDER -- YOU HAVE PARTICULAR SALARY HOWEVER WOMEN HAVE MOSTLY BEEN GEARED TOWARD CLERICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES AND YESTERDAY I KIND OF GAVE YOU THE EXAMPLE. OF OF A DOUBT ADOPTION SPECIALISTS WHO REQUIRES A MASTER'S DEGREE -- TO DO THE JOB DOESN'T RECEIVE AN MSA ON MERRY SALLY ADJUSTMENT TILL AFTER TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. HOWEVER A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER IN A HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICER ONLY REQUIRE A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE STUDIES THAT WE HAD WITH UC BERKELEY AND TAX STATE. THE REPORT SHOWS THAT OTHER STATES LIKE MINNESOTA AND WASHINGTON HAD DONE SOME RESEARCH AND ACTUALLY DID SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE VALUE OF WORK AND HOW. THE WORK SHE DID. BE ANALYZED BASED ON THE SKILLS THE RESPONSIBILITY EFFORT AND THE WORKPLACE CONDITIONS TO MEASURE THE VALUE AND TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO IDENTIFY THE GENDER PAY GAP OR GAPS AND AND FIX THEM ACCORDINGLY. I FOUND THAT VERY INTERESTING IN. IMPLICIT WITHIN THAT COMPARISON IS THAT A MALE CORRECTIONAL OFFICER WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. WOULD BE COMPENSATED AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN THE ADOPTION SPECIALIST WITH A MASTER'S DEGREE -- A FEMALE. TRADUCTION SPECIALIST IS THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A 13% GAP BETWEEN AN ADOPTION SPECIALISTS IN A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER AND A SPECIALIST AND A C. H. P. OFF. AND HOW DO WE BEGIN TO RECONCILE THAT WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THESE OTHER STATES EXPERIENCE ARE THEY AHEAD OF US IN. TRYING [inaudible] TO THEY THE QUALITY OF A THINNER. AND WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED FROM THEIR EFFORTS WELL I'VE I'VE LEARNED THAT -- LOOKING AT THE VALUE WORK COULD BE EXPENSIVE -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD LOOK AT ALONG WITH NON TRADITIONAL APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR WOMEN -- THAT WOULD HELP CLOSED AT THE PAY GAP. WE ACTUALLY HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF MENTORSHIP THE I. D.. A PROGRAM THAT WAS SPEARHEADED BY THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY -- I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD ALSO LOOK INTO A STATEWIDE MENTORSHIP PROGRAM FOR WOMEN. THANK YOU AND WE COULD. PURSUE THIS I HOPE WILL HAVE A CHANCE. AS WE WORK WITH THE IN THE FUTURE AND I THINK WE HAVE THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE JOB SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU -- ALONG THOSE LINES AND THANK YOU SENATOR FOR FOR STARTING AT LINE OF OF QUESTIONS -- DIALOGUE. IN TERMS OF AN INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE WORK FORCE. WHAT? WHAT ARE THE -- MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT THIS WAS ONE OF OUR STAFF QUESTIONS IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE ARE. IN MANAGEMENT IN THE STATE WHETHER US AS ELECTED OFFICIALS. GIVE ME YOUR THOUGHTS A LITTLE BIT ON THAT. WELL OF KELLY CHAR IS ACTUALLY WE HAVE A B. C. P. -- RIGHT NOW ASKING FOR RESOURCES FOR MORE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS -- WE HAVE IN THE PAST TAKEN A PASSIVE ROLE BECAUSE WE ARE EIGHT PLEASE GIVE GUIDANCE TO DEPARTMENTS BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN A MORE PROACTIVE ROLE. AND I BELIEVE THAT DOING A LITTLE BIT MORE FOCUS RECRUITMENT WITH THOSE AREAS THAT WE ARE UNDER UTILIZED WOULD BE MORE OF A FICTIVE. ROACH TO OF PROVIDING DIVERSE CITY INTO OUR IN OUR WORK STATE WORK FORCE -- SOME OTHER EFFORTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IS TE REGULATIONS FOR LIKE LEAP CLASSIFICATIONS FOR DISABLED PERSONS THERE'S BEEN SOME. GREAT AT STREAMLINING OF REGULATION SAYS ACTUALLY HELP IN THAT AREA TO HAVE MORE DISABLED. IN OUR WORK FORCE WE'VE ALSO PARTNERED WITH THE US MARINES COURT -- AND WE'VE DONE SOME FOCUS RECRUITMENT DOWN THERE -- TO GET MORE VETERANS INSIDE WE CREATED A MILITARY SKILLS TRANSLATOR BITS ON OUR WEBSITE. AND RIGHT NOW WE WE IT'S GEARED TOWARDS HIM. ALL BRANCHES WE WERE GOING TO ALSO BE I SPREADING OUT THROUGH THE ARMY THE NAVY AND THE OTHER -- BRANCHES OF THE MILITARY TO TO SEEK SOME MORE FOCUS RECRUITMENT IN THAT AREA. I SAW. AN A. IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE CAPABILITIES -- WE ARE INCREDIBLY DIVERSE AS A STATE. BUT IT SEEMS --YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT HOW TO INCREASE OUR LANGUAGE CAPABILITIES AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DIVERSE -- INCLUSION AND RECRUITMENT THEY'RE PROBABLY OUR COMMUNITIES WERE BETTER FOCUS AN OUT REACH COULD BE DONE. I I CAN'T I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE OUR REQUIREMENT LEVEL IN TERMS OF EDUCATION BUT WHERE HAVE YOU SEEN AREAS ARE EVIDENCE WHERE THERE ARE PARTICULAR PLACES WHERE WE NEED MORE LANGUAGE DIVERSITY AND THOUGHTS ON HOW. TO TO WORK ON THAT. WELL -- YES AND NO -- WE ACTUALLY HAVE A ONE EIGHT HUNDRED LINE FOR ANYONE THAT HAS ANY ISSUES WITH LANGUAGE AND WE WILL PROVIDE INTERPRETERS AT THE STATE EXPERIENCE FOR ANYBODY THAT. NEEDS THAT TYPE OF ASSISTANCE -- THE LINE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND WE PROBABLY MAYBE ON AVERAGE GET FIVE TO TEN CALLS A MONTH -- WHICH SEEMS TO BE KIND OF LOW FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DO YOU THINK IT'S A MATTER OF PEOPLE NOT BEING AWARE OF ALL OF THE NUMBER OR HOW. TO HOW TO ACCESS THAT COULD BE A FACTOR OKAY. THANK YOU AND LASTLY -- I WILL ASK YOU ABOUT ANOTHER TOPIC THAT I THINK STAFF -- PROBABLY BROUGHT UP AS AN ISSUE. AND THAT'S THE THE ISSUE OF OF AN ANTI NEPOTISM POLICY. AND YOUR **** I MEAN IF THEY IF THEY I'M SURE IT'S HARD IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE -- I WOULD THINK SACRAMENTO -- ONE WE RECRUIT FROM WHERE OR FROM COMMUNITIES OF WHICH WE KNOW I GUESS BUT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE ON THE ANTI NEPOTISM POLICY AND CERTAINLY WITH THE GOVERNORS ANNOUNCED EXPANSION OF THE PROBE AT THE I. ARE -- WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO REALLY ENSURE THAT ALL THE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ARE ACTUALLY AT HERRING TO THAT POLICY? WELL AND ACTUALLY YES THE NEPOTISM ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE PAPER OF LATE I HAVE BEEN QUITE DISTURBING -- CAL HR DOES HAVE A GUIDELINE POLICY THAT ASSISTS DEPARTMENTS ON HOW TO CREATE NEPOTISM POLICIES. WHAT CAL HR? HISTORICALLY HAS IT BEEN A ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. WE DO PARTNER WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES STATE PERSONNEL BOARD WHO HAS OVERSIGHT OF COMPLIANCE REVIEW AND THEY ACTUALLY. CHECK IN COMPLIANCE REVIEW EVERY DEPARTMENT. TO SEE THAT THEY HAVE A NEPOTISM POLICY. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GOT A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH -- ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES I WANT TO COMMEND YOU -- FOR YOUR HISTORY BY THE WAY I ASPIRED TO WORK IN THE MAIL ROOM -- BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY -- LET ME ASK THERE'S CLEARLY A NUMBER FOLKS HERE TO SUPPORT YOU LET ME ASK FOLKS WHO WOULD LIKE TO COME FORWARD. AND SUPPORT -- TO IT. COME TO THE MIKE IF YOU WOULD LIKE. TO OKAY I SEE A LOT OF HAPPY FACES SO I'M SURE THEY'RE JUST SILENTLY HAPPY -- ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. I DIDN'T THINK SO SO HI.
