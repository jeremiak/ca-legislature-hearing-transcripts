I DON'T KNOW.

00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:17.669 region:rollup2
NNOVA.

CHANGES THE AND THE GOVERNORS

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:33.519 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROPOSAL SINCE JANUARY

OF THE MAY REVISION FOR

PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT.

00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:38.357 region:rollup2
SO I'M IN FIGURE ONE ON ONE SIDE

00:27:37.456 --> 00:27:40.058 region:rollup2
OF YOUR SHEET AS ALL OF THE

00:27:38.357 --> 00:27:41.293 region:rollup2
CHANGES FOR PROPOSITION NINETY

00:27:40.058 --> 00:27:43.262 region:rollup2
EIGHT IN THE THREE FISCAL YEARS

00:27:41.293 --> 00:27:45.597 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN

00:27:43.262 --> 00:27:46.899 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

00:27:45.597 --> 00:27:49.067 region:rollup2
SO RELATIVE OUT TO THE

00:27:46.899 --> 00:27:51.103 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUT A. BUDGET REVENUE

00:27:49.067 --> 00:27:53.472 region:rollup2
INCREASES HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT

00:27:51.103 --> 00:27:54.806 region:rollup2
OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD.

00:27:53.472 --> 00:27:56.508 region:rollup2
FOR THE THREE YEAR PERIOD THAT

00:27:54.806 --> 00:27:58.443 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN REVENUES BEEN SEVEN

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:59.344 region:rollup2
POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS.

00:27:58.443 --> 00:28:01.346 region:rollup2
ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:02.915 region:rollup2
AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THREE

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:04.816 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:28:02.915 --> 00:28:06.318 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND THREE

00:28:04.816 --> 00:28:08.287 region:rollup2
POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS.

00:28:06.318 --> 00:28:10.055 region:rollup2
AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO AS WE

00:28:08.287 --> 00:28:11.256 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED ON AT A PREVIOUS

00:28:10.055 --> 00:28:12.891 region:rollup2
HEARING IN THE SIGNIFICANT

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:14.359 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN REVENUE DID NOT

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:15.827 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY TRANSLATE. TO

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:17.596 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE

00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:19.031 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE. THE PRIMARY REASON

00:28:17.596 --> 00:28:20.332 region:rollup2
THERE SEVERAL FACTORS INVOLVED

00:28:19.031 --> 00:28:22.034 region:rollup2
BUT THE PRIMARY REASON IS THAT

00:28:20.332 --> 00:28:24.169 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AS A TEST TO

00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:25.537 region:rollup2
YEAR. AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:27.372 region:rollup2
TURNS PROTESTS THREE YEAR TO

00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:29.174 region:rollup2
ATTEST TO YEAR WITH THE MAY

00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:30.309 region:rollup2
REVISION FACTORS. AND UNDER

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:31.777 region:rollup2
ATTEST TO YEAR.

00:28:30.309 --> 00:28:33.812 region:rollup2
THE GROWTH IN THE GUARANTEE IS

00:28:31.777 --> 00:28:36.782 region:rollup2
DRIVEN BY PER CAPITA PERSONAL

00:28:33.812 --> 00:28:38.050 region:rollup2
INCOME AND THAT DOESN'T ADJUST

00:28:36.782 --> 00:28:39.418 region:rollup2
WITH CHANGES IN STATE REVENUE.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:40.419 region:rollup2
SO THE ONLY ADDITIONAL AYE

00:28:39.418 --> 00:28:41.520 region:rollup2
INCREASE THAT YOU WOULD SEE IN A

00:28:40.419 --> 00:28:43.288 region:rollup2
TEST TO YEAR AS A RESULT OF

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.823 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN REVENUE. IS FROM THE

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:46.058 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE FACTOR PAYMENT AND

00:28:44.823 --> 00:28:46.758 region:rollup2
GENERALLY IF REVENUES GO UP

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:48.060 region:rollup2
THERE'S USUALLY A LARGER

00:28:46.758 --> 00:28:49.628 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE FACTOR PAYMENT THAT

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:52.164 region:rollup2
WOULD BE MADE ON TOP OF IT HAS

00:28:49.628 --> 00:28:53.232 region:rollup2
TO. HOWEVER IN A THIS FORECAST

00:28:52.164 --> 00:28:54.600 region:rollup2
WERE COMPLETELY PAIN THE

00:28:53.232 --> 00:28:56.401 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE FACTOR BALANCE OFF

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.003 region:rollup2
IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. SO ANY

00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:58.837 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN REVENUE AND

00:28:58.003 --> 00:29:02.174 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN

00:28:58.837 --> 00:29:02.708 region:rollup2
NINETEEN WILL NO LONGER RESULT

00:29:02.174 --> 00:29:03.375 region:rollup2
IN AN INCREASE THE MINIMUM

00:29:02.708 --> 00:29:04.009 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE.

00:29:03.375 --> 00:29:05.177 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S KIND OF THE REASONING

00:29:04.009 --> 00:29:06.945 region:rollup2
BEHIND THAT.

00:29:05.177 --> 00:29:08.513 region:rollup2
SO FOR US SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE

00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:09.481 region:rollup2
MEN ON GUARANTEE IS GOING UP TWO

00:29:08.513 --> 00:29:11.316 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY TWO MILLION

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:12.918 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. ON AND SIT SEVENTEEN

00:29:11.316 --> 00:29:14.453 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN FOUR HUNDRED SEVEN

00:29:12.918 --> 00:29:16.722 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN IN

00:29:14.453 --> 00:29:18.490 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AN ADDITIONAL

00:29:16.722 --> 00:29:19.257 region:rollup2
SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:20.759 region:rollup2
OVER THE PERIOD SO THAT'S A

00:29:19.257 --> 00:29:21.827 region:rollup2
TOTAL OF THREE YEAR PERIOD OF

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:23.462 region:rollup2
SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN

00:29:21.827 --> 00:29:25.130 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS.

00:29:23.462 --> 00:29:26.598 region:rollup2
SO ADDITIONALLY WHAT WE'VE DONE

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.966 region:rollup2
IN THE CITY ADMINISTRATION OF

00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:28.900 region:rollup2
DONNA ISN'T AND THAT'S PROPOSAL

00:29:27.966 --> 00:29:31.570 region:rollup2
IS WE'VE ALSO REVENGE THE

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.071 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE. TO INCLUDE A CHILD

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:34.840 region:rollup2
CARE WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT

00:29:33.071 --> 00:29:36.842 region:rollup2
WERE ADDED TO THE GUARANTEE IN

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.442 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN OUT

00:29:36.842 --> 00:29:39.378 region:rollup2
IN THE AMOUNT OF A HUNDRED AND

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:40.646 region:rollup2
FIFTY ONE. POINT FIVE MILLION

00:29:39.378 --> 00:29:41.880 region:rollup2
DOLLARS SO PART OF THE INCREASE

00:29:40.646 --> 00:29:43.515 region:rollup2
YOUR SCENE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.783 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVEN MILLION A LARGE

00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:45.684 region:rollup2
PORTION OF IT IS ACTUALLY FROM

00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:47.653 region:rollup2
THE RETENTION AND NOT

00:29:45.684 --> 00:29:50.522 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY THE CHANGES IN THE

00:29:47.653 --> 00:29:52.324 region:rollup2
FACTORS.

00:29:50.522 --> 00:29:54.059 region:rollup2
SO WHILE IT DOES SEEM THAT THE

00:29:52.324 --> 00:29:55.293 region:rollup2
FORECAST IS. NOT WHAT WE'RE

00:29:54.059 --> 00:29:56.395 region:rollup2
ACCUSTOMED TO IN TOTAL

00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:58.030 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS

00:29:56.395 --> 00:30:00.132 region:rollup2
GROWING SIGNIFICANTLY YEAR OVER

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.466 region:rollup2
YEAR OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD

00:30:00.132 --> 00:30:03.435 region:rollup2
THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE WHICH AND

00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:04.736 region:rollup2
SAT. SEVENTY EIGHT POINT FOUR

00:30:03.435 --> 00:30:06.738 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS AND EIGHTEEN

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:07.572 region:rollup2
NINETEEN IT'S A NINE POINT THREE

00:30:06.738 --> 00:30:09.041 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE OVER

00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:10.409 region:rollup2
THAT THREE YEAR PERIOD SO THERE

00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:12.110 region:rollup2
IS STILL SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN

00:30:10.409 --> 00:30:15.013 region:rollup2
THE GUARANTEE. JUST NOT WITH THE

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:15.647 region:rollup2
NEW REVENUES.

00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:17.716 region:rollup2
SO IN FIGURE TWO.

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:19.217 region:rollup2
IT IS A LIST OF ALL THE

00:30:17.716 --> 00:30:22.954 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE RESOURCES THAT.

00:30:19.217 --> 00:30:23.989 region:rollup2
ARE NEW AND THEN OF SOME THAT

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:24.523 region:rollup2
EXIST IN SUCH AS YOU BOTH THE

00:30:23.989 --> 00:30:27.492 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND MAY

00:30:24.523 --> 00:30:28.894 region:rollup2
REVISION SO IN TOTAL WITH THE

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:29.528 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN THE GUARANTEE.

00:30:28.894 --> 00:30:31.296 region:rollup2
A SUBTLE AT PAYMENTS AND OTHER

00:30:29.528 --> 00:30:32.631 region:rollup2
ONE TIME SAVINGS AVAILABLE WITH

00:30:31.296 --> 00:30:34.533 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THERE'S

00:30:32.631 --> 00:30:35.801 region:rollup2
AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED AND

00:30:34.533 --> 00:30:37.469 region:rollup2
EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF

00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:39.338 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE RESOURCES PUTTING THE

00:30:37.469 --> 00:30:41.306 region:rollup2
TOTAL FOR THE THREE YEAR PERIOD.

00:30:39.338 --> 00:30:42.007 region:rollup2
AT SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION.

00:30:41.306 --> 00:30:44.176 region:rollup2
SO BEFORE.

00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:45.510 region:rollup2
I MOVE ON TO THE SPENDING PLAN

00:30:44.176 --> 00:30:47.245 region:rollup2
THAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE I'D

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:49.314 region:rollup2
LIKE TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE

00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:49.781 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. UP FOR

00:30:49.314 --> 00:30:52.851 region:rollup2
CERTIFYING THE MINIMUM

00:30:49.781 --> 00:30:54.619 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE.

00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:56.288 region:rollup2
AS OUTLINED IN A YOUR FIGURE

00:30:54.619 --> 00:30:57.489 region:rollup2
THREE ON THIS PAGE. AT THE

00:30:56.288 --> 00:31:00.092 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A

00:30:57.489 --> 00:31:00.625 region:rollup2
NEW CERTIFICATION PROCESS.

00:31:00.092 --> 00:31:02.494 region:rollup2
IT'S PROCESS WOULD BE DONE

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:03.595 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY. IT WILL PROVIDE

00:31:02.494 --> 00:31:05.130 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY AROUND FUTURE

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:06.365 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS AND WILL

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.432 region:rollup2
ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

00:31:06.365 --> 00:31:09.501 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY AROUND THIS WHOLE

00:31:07.432 --> 00:31:11.770 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:31:09.501 --> 00:31:13.171 region:rollup2
IT WOULD ALSO HELP LIKE RESOLVE

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:15.040 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE

00:31:13.171 --> 00:31:16.041 region:rollup2
AND THAT KINDA GET STRUNG OUT

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.909 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE YEARS BECAUSE WE BE

00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:19.678 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ADDRESS INTERPRETATION

00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:20.946 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES IN AND DIFFERENT

00:31:19.678 --> 00:31:22.414 region:rollup2
VALUES IMMEDIATELY.

00:31:20.946 --> 00:31:24.750 region:rollup2
THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS WOULD

00:31:22.414 --> 00:31:26.518 region:rollup2
BEGAN AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:28.053 region:rollup2
WOULD GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO

00:31:26.518 --> 00:31:29.755 region:rollup2
CERTIFY IN YEARS FIVE STARTING

00:31:28.053 --> 00:31:31.022 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN. SO

00:31:29.755 --> 00:31:32.791 region:rollup2
UNDER CURRENT LAW THE MINIMUM

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:34.159 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE I SHOULD BE CERTIFIED

00:31:32.791 --> 00:31:36.395 region:rollup2
NINE MONTHS OUT OF AFTER THE

00:31:34.159 --> 00:31:37.829 region:rollup2
CLOSE OF THE FISCAL YEAR. SO THE

00:31:36.395 --> 00:31:39.164 region:rollup2
TIMELINE THAT SIN LA RIGHT NOW

00:31:37.829 --> 00:31:40.298 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK FOR

00:31:39.164 --> 00:31:41.633 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BECAUSE

00:31:40.298 --> 00:31:44.770 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE FACTORS ARE ACTUALLY

00:31:41.633 --> 00:31:46.905 region:rollup2
NOT FINAL. UNTIL IT WOULD BE

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:47.806 region:rollup2
THIS MAY REVISION PROCESS.

00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:49.141 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO BEEN OVER THOUGH.

00:31:47.806 --> 00:31:49.641 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS SOME

00:31:49.141 --> 00:31:51.343 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION LIKE HAD

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:53.645 region:rollup2
MENTIONED EARLIER DIFFERENCES

00:31:51.343 --> 00:31:54.780 region:rollup2
AND HOW THE LAWS INTERPRETED SO

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:56.114 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT WE HAVE NOT

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:58.316 region:rollup2
SERVED BY THE GUARANTEE SINCE

00:31:56.114 --> 00:31:59.951 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE.

00:31:58.316 --> 00:32:01.253 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:02.921 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S FOCUS ON

00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:04.256 region:rollup2
RETIRING DEBTS AND LIABILITIES

00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:05.757 region:rollup2
AND THEN JUST THROWING UP ANY

FISCAL YEAR WERE CERTIFYING THAN

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:30.902 region:rollup2
THAT AMOUNT OVER THAT EXCEEDS

00:34:29.935 --> 00:34:32.437 region:rollup2
THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE WOULD

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:34.005 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BE CREDITED TO THIS

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:35.373 region:rollup2
COST ALLOCATION ACCOUNT.

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:36.675 region:rollup2
AND HAT CREDIT WOULD BE USED IN

00:34:35.373 --> 00:34:38.376 region:rollup2
FUTURE TIMES WHEN WE OWE SCHOOL

00:34:36.675 --> 00:34:40.078 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS

00:34:38.376 --> 00:34:42.280 region:rollup2

CERTIFIED THE GUARANTEE.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.019 region:rollup2
AND IT'S DETERMINED THAT THERE'S

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:49.888 region:rollup2
NOT ENOUGH THAT'S BEEN

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:51.222 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATED THEN AFTER THE

APPROPRIATE. THOUGHT SATELLITE

00:34:54.326 --> 00:34:57.195 region:rollup2
BALANCE.

00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:59.064 region:rollup2
FIRST THOUGH THEY WOULD PLAY ANY

00:34:57.195 --> 00:35:01.333 region:rollup2
CREDIT IN THIS A COST ALLOCATION

00:34:59.064 --> 00:35:01.933 region:rollup2
SCHEDULED TO FIX

00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:03.435 region:rollup2
EXTENT THAT IT COVERS THAT IN

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:05.637 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT IT DOESN'T COVER

00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:07.072 region:rollup2
WOULD BE APPROPRIATED. IF THE

00:35:05.637 --> 00:35:07.706 region:rollup2
STATE COULDN'T AFFORD TO MAKE

00:35:07.072 --> 00:35:10.041 region:rollup2
THE FULL PAYMENT THAT POINT IN

00:35:07.706 --> 00:35:11.876 region:rollup2
TIME. THAN A MULTI YEAR PAYMENT

00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:13.611 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT WOULD BE OUT IN THE

00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:14.879 region:rollup2
BUDGET PROCESS AND THE

00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:16.848 region:rollup2
CONTROLLER WOULD APPROPRIATE

00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:17.849 region:rollup2
TOWARD THAT SCHEDULE SO PROVIDES

00:35:16.848 --> 00:35:19.951 region:rollup2
MORE CERTAINTY AND MANY

00:35:17.849 --> 00:35:21.019 region:rollup2
SATELLITE PAYMENTS.

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:29.861 region:rollup2
IN SOME OF OUR SETTLED POUNCES

RIGHT NOW DATE BACK TO NINE TEN.

00:35:29.861 --> 00:35:33.031 region:rollup2
THERE IS A CAP.

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:34.966 region:rollup2
ON THE COST ALLOCATION SCHEDULE

00:35:33.031 --> 00:35:36.234 region:rollup2
OF ONE PERCENT

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.635 region:rollup2
SO THIS DOES PUT WHAT GOD DOES

00:35:36.234 --> 00:35:40.672 region:rollup2
LIMIT THE FLEXIBILITY OF THIS

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:42.774 region:rollup2
COST ALLOCATION BUT IT ALSO.

00:35:40.672 --> 00:35:44.042 region:rollup2
ALLOWS IT TO NOT GROW AS LARGE.

00:35:42.774 --> 00:35:46.011 region:rollup2
OR TWO LARGE THAT IT'S BECOMES

00:35:44.042 --> 00:35:47.112 region:rollup2
UNWIELDY.

00:35:46.011 --> 00:35:48.947 region:rollup2
SO ALSO AS PART OF THE.

00:35:47.112 --> 00:35:50.015 region:rollup2
.

00:35:48.947 --> 00:35:51.649 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

00:35:50.015 --> 00:35:53.184 region:rollup2
THERE'S A PROPOSAL TO MAKE THE

FAST

00:35:57.489 --> 00:36:00.525 region:rollup2
THE BASIS CONTINUOUSLY

DISCRETIONARY.

00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:06.197 region:rollup2
SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO IT

00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:07.832 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T IT WOULD MIMIC THE

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:08.767 region:rollup2

SO AND FINALLY I MIGHT MENTION

00:36:18.076 --> 00:36:20.879 region:rollup2
IT EARLIER BUT IT IS PART OF

00:36:19.377 --> 00:36:21.980 region:rollup2

I'LL BE COVERING.

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:47.478 region:rollup2
OR ANALYSIS OF THE GUARANTEE

00:40:45.677 --> 00:40:48.947 region:rollup2

00:40:48.947 --> 00:40:51.983 region:rollup2
THE SPECIFIC SPENDING PROPOSALS.

00:40:50.715 --> 00:40:53.151 region:rollup2
AND I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A

00:40:51.983 --> 00:40:55.253 region:rollup2
REPORT TO OUR OFFICE RELEASED

00:40:53.151 --> 00:40:56.154 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

00:40:55.253 --> 00:40:57.889 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU HEARD THE

00:40:56.154 --> 00:41:00.124 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION SAY AND AS YOU

00:40:57.889 --> 00:41:01.659 region:rollup2
CAN SEE IN FIGURE ONE ON PAGE

00:41:00.124 --> 00:41:03.227 region:rollup2
THREE OF OUR REPORT. AT THE

00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:04.929 region:rollup2
MINIMUM GUARANTEE OVER THE THREE

00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:06.397 region:rollup2
YEAR BUDGET PERIOD IS UP SEVEN

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:07.298 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN MILLION

00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:08.866 region:rollup2
OVER THE JNUARY BUDGET

00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:09.901 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES.

00:41:08.866 --> 00:41:11.336 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION

00:41:09.901 --> 00:41:13.705 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE

00:41:11.336 --> 00:41:15.273 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TESTS AND FACTORS BUT

00:41:13.705 --> 00:41:16.240 region:rollup2
STEPPING BACK A LITTLE BIT THE

00:41:15.273 --> 00:41:17.442 region:rollup2
WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.644 region:rollup2
INCREASED REALLY IS THAT IT'S

00:41:17.442 --> 00:41:21.079 region:rollup2
THE RESULT OF TWO CHANGES.

00:41:19.644 --> 00:41:22.547 region:rollup2
BUT HALF OF THE INCREASE IS DUE

00:41:21.079 --> 00:41:24.816 region:rollup2
TO HIGHER REVENUE ESTIMATES

00:41:22.547 --> 00:41:27.251 region:rollup2
COMPARED JANUARY. AND THE OTHER

00:41:24.816 --> 00:41:29.454 region:rollup2
HALF IS DUE TO THAT A PROPOSAL

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:30.822 region:rollup2
TO RE BENCH OR ADJUST THE

00:41:29.454 --> 00:41:32.056 region:rollup2
MINIMUM GUARANTEE UPWARD.

00:41:30.822 --> 00:41:34.125 region:rollup2
AFTER THE SHIFT OF PRESCHOOL

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:36.828 region:rollup2
COSTS THAT THE STATE.

00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:38.663 region:rollup2
INITIATED SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

00:41:36.828 --> 00:41:39.130 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE GROWTH IN THE

00:41:38.663 --> 00:41:40.565 region:rollup2
GUARANTEED.

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:42.333 region:rollup2
DESPAIR VISION REALLY IS ABOUT

00:41:40.565 --> 00:41:43.501 region:rollup2
AS GOOD AS IT GETS.

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:44.736 region:rollup2
I REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE A FEW

00:41:43.501 --> 00:41:46.204 region:rollup2
BILLION HIGHER THAN THE

00:41:44.736 --> 00:41:47.739 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION OVER THE PERIOD.

00:41:46.204 --> 00:41:49.040 region:rollup2
A MAINLY DUE TO OUR ESTIMATES OF

00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:50.942 region:rollup2
HIGHER PERSONAL INCOME TAX

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.176 region:rollup2
REVENUE. BUT EVEN IF THOSE

00:41:50.942 --> 00:41:53.845 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES MIGHT WHICH

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:55.012 region:rollup2
MATERIALIZE THE WAY WE ARE

00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:56.180 region:rollup2
PROTECTING OUR OUTLOOK THE

00:41:55.012 --> 00:41:58.282 region:rollup2
MINIMUM GUARANTEE WOULDN'T BE

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:59.450 region:rollup2
ANY HIGHER THAN WHAT. I EAT YOU

00:41:58.282 --> 00:42:01.152 region:rollup2
SEE TODAY.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:03.855 region:rollup2
IN FACT WE THINK THE TWENTY

00:42:01.152 --> 00:42:05.390 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GUARANTEE I'M

00:42:03.855 --> 00:42:05.990 region:rollup2
NOT AS LIKELY TO BE SOMEWHAT

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.257 region:rollup2
LOWER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.192 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES

00:42:06.257 --> 00:42:09.327 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES.

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:12.196 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S LARGELY DUE TO WHAT

00:42:09.327 --> 00:42:13.531 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES I ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:15.066 region:rollup2
STUDENT ATTENDANCE.

00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:16.801 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION SIMILAR TO

00:42:15.066 --> 00:42:18.536 region:rollup2
JANUARY. ASSUMES THAT IS ENOUGH

00:42:16.801 --> 00:42:20.872 region:rollup2
OF AN INCREASE IN ATTENDANCE TO

00:42:18.536 --> 00:42:22.306 region:rollup2
TRIGGER A SPECIAL. PROVISION IN

00:42:20.872 --> 00:42:23.875 region:rollup2
THE CONSTITUTION THAT AYE

00:42:22.306 --> 00:42:25.243 region:rollup2
PREVENTS THE GUARANTEE FROM

00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:26.377 region:rollup2
DROPPING.

00:42:25.243 --> 00:42:27.779 region:rollup2
A PRELIMINARY DATA FROM

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:29.347 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SUGGEST

00:42:27.779 --> 00:42:30.815 region:rollup2
THAT'S. NOT LIKELY TO BE THE

00:42:29.347 --> 00:42:32.717 region:rollup2
CASE

00:42:30.815 --> 00:42:33.484 region:rollup2
SO THE I GUARANTEE COULD END UP

00:42:32.717 --> 00:42:35.586 region:rollup2
A FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:38.456 region:rollup2
BELOW. ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE MAYOR

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:38.956 region:rollup2
VISION RIGHT NOW.

00:42:38.456 --> 00:42:39.891 region:rollup2
I TUNING TO PROPERTY TAX

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:40.291 region:rollup2
REVENUE.

00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:41.859 region:rollup2
THAT WE THINK THE

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:43.327 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES ARE A

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:44.429 region:rollup2
LITTLE LOW THERE A GROWTH IN

00:42:43.327 --> 00:42:45.997 region:rollup2
HOUSING PRICES HAS BEEN VERY

00:42:44.429 --> 00:42:47.465 region:rollup2
STRONG OF LATE THE NUMBER OF NEW

00:42:45.997 --> 00:42:48.933 region:rollup2
BUILDING PERMITS ISSUED HAS BEEN

00:42:47.465 --> 00:42:51.102 region:rollup2
ON THE RISE.

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:53.071 region:rollup2
SO WE THINK PROPERTY TAXES OVER

00:42:51.102 --> 00:42:54.505 region:rollup2
THE THREE YEARS I LIKELY TO BE

00:42:53.071 --> 00:42:55.473 region:rollup2
UP AROUND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:57.341 region:rollup2
MILLION OVER THE

00:42:55.473 --> 00:42:59.043 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES.

00:42:57.341 --> 00:42:59.977 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT NOT SO

00:42:59.043 --> 00:43:01.279 region:rollup2
MUCH FOR ITS EFFECT ON SCHOOL

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:03.481 region:rollup2
FUNDING PUT FOR THE WAY THAT

00:43:01.279 --> 00:43:06.751 region:rollup2
THAT FREES UP. HALF FUNDING FOR

00:43:03.481 --> 00:43:08.719 region:rollup2
OTHER PRIORITIES IN YOUR BUDGET.

00:43:06.751 --> 00:43:09.587 region:rollup2
TRYING TO CERTIFICATION I THINK

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:11.122 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION WALKED YOU

00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:12.990 region:rollup2
THROUGH KIND OF THE MECHANICS OF

00:43:11.122 --> 00:43:14.258 region:rollup2
HOW THAT WOULD WORK. ON OUR JUST

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:15.793 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU A QUICK RECAP OF ONE

00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:18.162 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF THAT PROPOSAL WHICH

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:19.730 region:rollup2
IS THIS NEW PROPOSITION NINETY

00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:21.265 region:rollup2
EIGHT COST ALLOCATION SCHEDULE.

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.733 region:rollup2
IT SOUNDS LIKE A FAIRLY COMPLEX

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:24.268 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL BUT IT'S REALLY

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:25.670 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM

00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:27.538 region:rollup2
THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE A LOT OF

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.406 region:rollup2
HUMILITY FAMILIARITY WEST ON

00:43:27.538 --> 00:43:30.308 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE. WHICH IS THOSE

00:43:28.406 --> 00:43:31.776 region:rollup2
UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN THE

00:43:30.308 --> 00:43:32.910 region:rollup2
MINIMUM GUARANTEE <u><c.green>.</c></u>

00:43:31.776 --> 00:43:34.178 region:rollup2
I'M TIMES THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:36.914 region:rollup2
INCREASES AFTER WE ADOPT THE

00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:38.483 region:rollup2
BUDGET SOMETIMES IT FALLS AND

00:43:36.914 --> 00:43:40.518 region:rollup2
THE RESULT IS THAT A HIGH SCHOOL

00:43:38.483 --> 00:43:43.454 region:rollup2
FUNDING ARE RELATIVE TO THAT NEW

00:43:40.518 --> 00:43:45.056 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE IS OFTEN. A HIGHER

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:46.157 region:rollup2
LOWER THAN WHAT YOU INTEND.

00:43:45.056 --> 00:43:47.992 region:rollup2
IN CASES WHERE THE MINIMUM

00:43:46.157 --> 00:43:49.427 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE IS DROPPED.

00:43:47.992 --> 00:43:51.095 region:rollup2
BY THE STATE IN THE PAST HAS

00:43:49.427 --> 00:43:52.964 region:rollup2
OFTEN RESPONDED BY SCORING SOME

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:54.365 region:rollup2
OF THAT MONEY ABOVE THE

00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:55.967 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE QUITE A DIFFERENT

00:43:54.365 --> 00:43:57.935 region:rollup2
FISCAL YEAR WHERE IT HASN'T

00:43:55.967 --> 00:43:58.836 region:rollup2
FULLY FUNDED THE GUARANTEE.

00:43:57.935 --> 00:44:00.304 region:rollup2
AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:02.206 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY IS TO AUTOMATE THAT

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:03.808 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND SO AS PART OF A

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:05.443 region:rollup2
REGULAR. ROUTINE BUDGET CLOSE UP

00:44:03.808 --> 00:44:08.045 region:rollup2
PROCESS

00:44:05.443 --> 00:44:08.613 region:rollup2
STATE WITHOUT FUNDING. AS CLOSE

00:44:08.045 --> 00:44:09.847 region:rollup2
TO THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AS

00:44:08.613 --> 00:44:11.015 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:12.483 region:rollup2
AND THAT CERTAINLY DOESN'T

00:44:11.015 --> 00:44:13.751 region:rollup2
PREVENT YOU FROM FUNDING MORE

00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:15.686 region:rollup2
THAN THE GUARANTEE IF THAT'S

00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:17.388 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU INTEND. ABOUT THIS

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:18.756 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL A.

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:21.092 region:rollup2
MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT THAT

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:22.793 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T HAPPEN INADVERTENTLY.

00:44:21.092 --> 00:44:24.128 region:rollup2
OVERALL WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:26.564 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL AT CERTIFICATION

00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:27.131 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL OFFER SOME CLEAR

00:44:26.564 --> 00:44:28.132 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGES OVER THE CURRENT

00:44:27.131 --> 00:44:29.567 region:rollup2
PRICE.

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:31.435 region:rollup2
IT'S MY TRANSPARENT WITH THE

00:44:29.567 --> 00:44:32.436 region:rollup2
PUBLICATION THE FACTORS.

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:34.305 region:rollup2
IT PROMOTES FASTER RESOLUTION OF

00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:35.239 region:rollup2
DISPUTES.

00:44:34.305 --> 00:44:37.208 region:rollup2
PLUS FINANCIALLY RISKY FOR THE

00:44:35.239 --> 00:44:38.476 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:40.344 region:rollup2
IN SOME CASES THE STATE HAS HAD

00:44:38.476 --> 00:44:41.846 region:rollup2
TO RECOGNIZE SIGNIFICANT.

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:43.581 region:rollup2
I INCREASES IN THE GUARANTEE

00:44:41.846 --> 00:44:44.649 region:rollup2
OFTEN MANY MANY YEARS AFTER THE

00:44:43.581 --> 00:44:46.150 region:rollup2
YEAR IS OVER AND THAT'S

00:44:44.649 --> 00:44:47.652 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T.

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:48.920 region:rollup2
HAPPENED A FEW CERTIFIED IN

00:44:47.652 --> 00:44:50.488 region:rollup2
LOCKDOWN THE GUARANTEE IN A MORE

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.656 region:rollup2
TIMELY WAY.

00:44:50.488 --> 00:44:53.558 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY WE THINK IT'S

00:44:51.656 --> 00:44:54.992 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CLEAR OUTLINE OF

00:44:53.558 --> 00:44:56.561 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY IT LETS YOU HOLD

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:58.729 region:rollup2
AYE ONE INDIVIDUAL THE DIRECTOR

00:44:56.561 --> 00:44:59.297 region:rollup2
OF FINANCE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

00:44:58.729 --> 00:44:59.564 region:rollup2
TIMELY CERTIFICATION OF THE

00:44:59.297 --> 00:45:01.799 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE

00:44:59.564 --> 00:45:03.768 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR.

00:45:01.799 --> 00:45:05.002 region:rollup2
AS WE RECOMMEND A APPROVING THE

00:45:03.768 --> 00:45:07.071 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I JUST WITH

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:08.539 region:rollup2
ONE MODIFICATION TO REMOVE THE

00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:09.640 region:rollup2
CAP THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:10.875 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT WE JUST THINK THAT

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:13.311 region:rollup2
THAT ADDS SOME UNNECESSARY

00:45:10.875 --> 00:45:15.379 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITY. AND AND DOESN'T HELP

00:45:13.311 --> 00:45:17.448 region:rollup2
ADVANCE AUTO BUT THIS PROPOSAL

00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:18.816 region:rollup2
IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH.

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:20.718 region:rollup2
I SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN THINGS

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:22.587 region:rollup2
OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO COVER

00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:24.689 region:rollup2
THE K. TWELVE. AND REALLY

00:45:22.587 --> 00:45:26.557 region:rollup2
EDUCATION PROPOSALS.

00:45:24.689 --> 00:45:27.825 region:rollup2
SEN JENNIFER CAN. I MAKE YOU

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:29.660 region:rollup2
TURN THE PAGE A AND NINE OF THE

00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:31.662 region:rollup2
REPORT YOU CAN SEE THE BREAKDOWN

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.563 region:rollup2
OF NINETY EIGHT FUNDING JUST FOR

00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:34.098 region:rollup2
KEY TWELVE EDUCATION.

00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:36.367 region:rollup2
AND ON FIGURE THREE YOU CAN SEE

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:39.670 region:rollup2
ALL OF THAT ITEMIZE CHANGES AND

00:45:36.367 --> 00:45:41.939 region:rollup2
MAY BOTH ONGOING AND ONE TIME.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:43.407 region:rollup2
I FINANCE LAID THOSE OUT SO I

00:45:41.939 --> 00:45:45.142 region:rollup2
WAS GONNA SPEND MOST OF MY TIME

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:47.378 region:rollup2
HERE ON FIGURE FOR WHICH IS

00:45:45.142 --> 00:45:49.747 region:rollup2
HITTING THE MAIN OF PAGE ELEVEN.

00:45:47.378 --> 00:45:52.717 region:rollup2
THE MAIN PROPOSALS AND MAY AND

00:45:49.747 --> 00:45:54.185 region:rollup2
OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THEM.

00:45:52.717 --> 00:45:55.987 region:rollup2
AND SO HITTING SOME HIGHLIGHTS

00:45:54.185 --> 00:45:58.022 region:rollup2
ON THE DISCRETIONARY GRANTS THE

00:45:55.987 --> 00:45:59.557 region:rollup2
FUNDING HAS UP WE CONTINUE TO BE

00:45:58.022 --> 00:46:00.691 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT IF THE STATE USES

00:45:59.557 --> 00:46:02.426 region:rollup2
THE APPROACH IT'S BEEN USING OF

00:46:00.691 --> 00:46:03.961 region:rollup2
JUST GIVING IT OUT ON EIGHTY A

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:06.597 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ANY REAL.

00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:08.232 region:rollup2
CONNECTION SOME MANDATES THE

00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:09.767 region:rollup2
STATE WILL NOT REDUCE THE

00:46:08.232 --> 00:46:11.068 region:rollup2
MANDATE BACKLOG IT'LL JUST ON

00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:12.903 region:rollup2
THE BOOKS FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:14.405 region:rollup2
COME.

00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:15.273 region:rollup2
ON THE ONGOING FUND IN THE TWO

00:46:14.405 --> 00:46:16.774 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN

00:46:15.273 --> 00:46:18.042 region:rollup2
MILLION OF THAT A HUNDRED AND

00:46:16.774 --> 00:46:19.510 region:rollup2
SIXTY SIX MILLION IS ON TOP OF

00:46:18.042 --> 00:46:20.378 region:rollup2
THE TARGETS.

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.912 region:rollup2
SO YOU'VE BEEN TALKING

00:46:20.378 --> 00:46:23.514 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR OF ONCE YOU

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:24.749 region:rollup2
REACH THE TARGETS HOW MIGHT YOU

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:26.584 region:rollup2
WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY ABOVE

00:46:24.749 --> 00:46:28.085 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU JUST INDICATE THAT

00:46:26.584 --> 00:46:29.587 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE CHOICES ABOUT THAT.

00:46:28.085 --> 00:46:31.222 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX MILLION

00:46:29.587 --> 00:46:33.658 region:rollup2
WHETHER YOU USE THAT AS THEY AS

00:46:31.222 --> 00:46:35.293 region:rollup2
THEY PROPOSE FOR INCREASES IN

00:46:33.658 --> 00:46:36.661 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE RATES COMPARABLY OR

00:46:35.293 --> 00:46:38.195 region:rollup2
INVESTED IN THE BASE OR THE

00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:41.032 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENT YOU HAVE CHOICES IN

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:43.634 region:rollup2
THAT REGARD.

00:46:41.032 --> 00:46:45.236 region:rollup2
WITH AUTOMATING THE COLA FOR

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:46.404 region:rollup2
ELSE YOU HAVE TO. PUT UP GRADINA

00:46:45.236 --> 00:46:47.905 region:rollup2
AND TAKING IT OUT OF THE BUDGET

00:46:46.404 --> 00:46:48.539 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WE RECOMMEND YOU

00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:49.774 region:rollup2
REJECT THAT PIECE OF THAT THIS

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:50.975 region:rollup2
IS THE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:46:49.774 --> 00:46:53.978 region:rollup2
BUDGET DECISIONS YOU MAKE EVERY

00:46:50.975 --> 00:46:54.812 region:rollup2
YEAR. IS HOW MUCH DO YOU WANNA

00:46:53.978 --> 00:46:56.914 region:rollup2
AUGMENT LCF OFF BY.

00:46:54.812 --> 00:46:58.683 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE

00:46:56.914 --> 00:47:00.518 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE LAST

00:46:58.683 --> 00:47:01.952 region:rollup2
YEAR'S BASS AS ADJUSTED FOR

00:47:00.518 --> 00:47:03.721 region:rollup2
INCUMBENTS THOSE ARE MORE

00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:04.722 region:rollup2
AUTOMATIC BUT IF YOU WANT TO

00:47:03.721 --> 00:47:06.624 region:rollup2
PROVIDE AN AUGMENTATION WE

00:47:04.722 --> 00:47:07.992 region:rollup2
SUGGEST YOU RETAIN NOT AUTHORITY

00:47:06.624 --> 00:47:11.028 region:rollup2
INSIDE THE CONTEXT OF THE ANNUAL

00:47:07.992 --> 00:47:12.329 region:rollup2
BUDGET PROCESS.

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:14.265 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO PROPOSALS AND MAY

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:16.167 region:rollup2
RELATED SU WHAT'S CALLED THE L.

00:47:14.265 --> 00:47:17.368 region:rollup2
PACK OR THE NEW STYLE TO THE

00:47:16.167 --> 00:47:18.969 region:rollup2
ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFESSOR

00:47:17.368 --> 00:47:21.372 region:rollup2
PROFICIENCY EXAM.

00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:23.274 region:rollup2
ONE IS TWENTY TWO MILLION TO

00:47:21.372 --> 00:47:24.642 region:rollup2
MAKE WHAT IS NOW PAN AND AND

00:47:23.274 --> 00:47:26.210 region:rollup2
PENCIL I'M SORRY PENCIL AND

00:47:24.642 --> 00:47:27.645 region:rollup2
PAPER INTO COMPUTER.

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:29.347 region:rollup2
COMPUTER BASED.

00:47:27.645 --> 00:47:31.315 region:rollup2
.

00:47:29.347 --> 00:47:33.317 region:rollup2
THE COST ESTIMATE INCLUDED IN

00:47:31.315 --> 00:47:33.951 region:rollup2
THE MAY REVISE IS ABOUT TWICE

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:35.219 region:rollup2
WHAT IT COST JUST TO DEVELOP THE

00:47:33.951 --> 00:47:36.754 region:rollup2
TYPE.

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:38.489 region:rollup2
AND ALL THAT'S HAPPENING IS

00:47:36.754 --> 00:47:40.191 region:rollup2
MOVING UP FROM THE PAPER VERSION

00:47:38.489 --> 00:47:42.293 region:rollup2
TO THE COMPUTER VERSION IT'S NOT

00:47:40.191 --> 00:47:44.095 region:rollup2
A COMPUTER ADAPTIVE TEST IT

00:47:42.293 --> 00:47:45.830 region:rollup2
REALLY IS JUST ALLOWING THE TASK

00:47:44.095 --> 00:47:48.132 region:rollup2
TO BE MADE. ON COMPUTER SO WE

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:50.067 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS MUCH TOO EXPENSIVE

00:47:48.132 --> 00:47:51.769 region:rollup2
SO JUST YEAR ADOPTED FOR THE

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:53.537 region:rollup2
TIME BEING ASK FOR A BIAS

00:47:51.769 --> 00:47:54.872 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL NEXT YEAR.

00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:56.340 region:rollup2
THERE'S SIX MILLION BEING

00:47:54.872 --> 00:47:58.709 region:rollup2
REQUESTED FOR.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:00.745 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE EL CAP THAT WOULD

00:47:58.709 --> 00:48:02.680 region:rollup2
SERVE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

00:48:00.745 --> 00:48:04.248 region:rollup2
THE STATE TO DATE HAS NEVER HAD

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.850 region:rollup2
SUCH A TASK.

00:48:04.248 --> 00:48:07.752 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:09.720 region:rollup2
TAKE THE TUSTIN ALTERNATIVE TEST

00:48:07.752 --> 00:48:11.288 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR AND RIGHT NOW I A P.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.923 region:rollup2
TEAMS ARE DECIDING WHAT

00:48:11.288 --> 00:48:14.558 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE TO USE.

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:16.260 region:rollup2
THERE COULD BE A CASE TO BE MADE

00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:18.162 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THERE SHOULD BE A

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.964 region:rollup2
UNIFORM ALTERNATIVE BUT IT ISN'T

00:48:18.162 --> 00:48:21.766 region:rollup2
ENTIRELY CLEAR AT THIS POINT

00:48:19.964 --> 00:48:24.969 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT'S ESSENTIAL.

00:48:21.766 --> 00:48:26.337 region:rollup2
SO HERE WE ARE JUST ADJUSTING

00:48:24.969 --> 00:48:28.205 region:rollup2
GIVE ME. DON'T JUDGMENT CLARA

00:48:26.337 --> 00:48:29.573 region:rollup2
YOU TALK ABOUT THE EL PACK YES

00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:31.108 region:rollup2
THAT THE THE NEW SELF IF YOU ASK

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:32.410 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:48:31.108 --> 00:48:33.577 region:rollup2
SO ON THIS ONE IS TO CREATE AN

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:35.212 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE THAT WOULD BE FOR

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:36.814 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS BUT

00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:39.116 region:rollup2
AGAIN THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE IT

00:48:36.814 --> 00:48:40.785 region:rollup2
TO DATE THERE'S A. FEW STUDENTS

00:48:39.116 --> 00:48:41.852 region:rollup2
THAT TAKE THAT OUT SO THIS IS

00:48:40.785 --> 00:48:43.621 region:rollup2
JUST ADJUSTING ON THE NEXT

00:48:41.852 --> 00:48:45.790 region:rollup2
COUPLE WEEKS OF THE DEPARTMENT

00:48:43.621 --> 00:48:47.158 region:rollup2
CAN CLARIFY THAT IT IS REQUIRED

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:49.427 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE PROCEED IN THIS

00:48:47.158 --> 00:48:51.595 region:rollup2
FASHION. YOU COULD WITHHOLD AND

00:48:49.427 --> 00:48:52.563 region:rollup2
AGAIN REVISIT NEXT YEAR YOU

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:54.031 region:rollup2
COULD GET BETTER ABSTINENCE

00:48:52.563 --> 00:48:55.633 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE PROJECT ITSELF HOW

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:57.701 region:rollup2
MUCH IT WILL COST.

00:48:55.633 --> 00:48:59.270 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW IN BED AT

00:48:57.701 --> 00:49:00.504 region:rollup2
THE TO THE ONE FOR THE

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:02.173 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENT AND THE

00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:03.841 region:rollup2
COMPUTER ASSESSMENT SO IT'S HARD

00:49:02.173 --> 00:49:05.042 region:rollup2
FOR US RIGHT NOW TO DISENTANGLE

00:49:03.841 --> 00:49:07.445 region:rollup2
IF YOU ONLY DID WANTED TO DO ONE

00:49:05.042 --> 00:49:08.679 region:rollup2
OR THE OTHER.

00:49:07.445 --> 00:49:10.514 region:rollup2
ON THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:11.816 region:rollup2
GRANT PROGRAM YOU MIGHT RECALL

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:13.951 region:rollup2
THAT LAST YEAR YOU INCREASE THE

00:49:11.816 --> 00:49:15.319 region:rollup2
GRANTS AMOUNT FROM SEVEN FIFTY

00:49:13.951 --> 00:49:17.521 region:rollup2
TO ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:18.722 region:rollup2
PER STUDENT. AND AT THE TIME IT

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:21.559 region:rollup2
WAS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU

00:49:18.722 --> 00:49:21.559 region:rollup2
COULD DO THAT WITHIN THE

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:24.862 region:rollup2
AND TWELVE MILLION.

00:49:23.461 --> 00:49:26.697 region:rollup2
THE ESTIMATES AT THE TIME WERE

00:49:24.862 --> 00:49:28.199 region:rollup2
NOT VERY GOOD SO THE PROGRAM IS

00:49:26.697 --> 00:49:30.067 region:rollup2
COMING IN MUCH MORE EXPENSE OF

00:49:28.199 --> 00:49:31.368 region:rollup2
TODAY. AND THE MAYOR VISION

00:49:30.067 --> 00:49:33.504 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL HAS.

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:35.339 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL

00:49:33.504 --> 00:49:38.275 region:rollup2
IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND THEN

00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:39.777 region:rollup2
AUGMENT AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

00:49:38.275 --> 00:49:41.412 region:rollup2
BUT WE WAS JUST UP THE US MINT

00:49:39.777 --> 00:49:42.646 region:rollup2
STILL HURT VERY GOOD SO IN

00:49:41.412 --> 00:49:44.014 region:rollup2
RUNNING INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENTS

00:49:42.646 --> 00:49:45.316 region:rollup2
WE THINK IF YOU WANNA GET AT

00:49:44.014 --> 00:49:46.817 region:rollup2
THIS HIGHER LEVEL THE ELEVEN

00:49:45.316 --> 00:49:48.152 region:rollup2
HUNDRED IT WOULD TAKE MORE MONEY

00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:49.420 region:rollup2
IN BOTH YEARS.

00:49:48.152 --> 00:49:50.421 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE THE ESTIMATES HERO

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:52.089 region:rollup2
CHICK TWENTY FOUR MILLION

00:49:50.421 --> 00:49:53.824 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR

00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:55.125 region:rollup2
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:57.027 region:rollup2
BUDGET YEAR SO IS A LOT OF MONEY

00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:58.429 region:rollup2
ON THE TABLE THE PROGRAM AGAIN

00:49:57.027 --> 00:49:59.997 region:rollup2
AS A HUNDRED AND TWELVE BILLION

00:49:58.429 --> 00:50:01.265 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR SO PROVIDING A FIFTY

00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:02.666 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION A

00:50:01.265 --> 00:50:04.001 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL.

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:05.469 region:rollup2
SO WE ALSO GIVE YOU JUST AN

00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:07.004 region:rollup2
OPTION IF YOU WANTED TO GO BACK

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:08.372 region:rollup2
TO THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:50:07.004 --> 00:50:10.307 region:rollup2
PER PUPIL MAX MIGHT NOT COST

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:10.908 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY LAST IT'S STILL

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:12.843 region:rollup2
COST MORE THAN LAST YEAR EIGHT

00:50:10.908 --> 00:50:14.445 region:rollup2
MILLION.

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:16.146 region:rollup2
ON THE SCHOOL CLIMATE INITIATIVE

00:50:14.445 --> 00:50:18.549 region:rollup2
THIS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR MAY

00:50:16.146 --> 00:50:20.251 region:rollup2
REVISION PROPOSAL.

00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:21.752 region:rollup2
IT'S BUILT OFF OF THIS MULTI

00:50:20.251 --> 00:50:23.487 region:rollup2
TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WHICH

00:50:21.752 --> 00:50:25.189 region:rollup2
IS JUST A TERMINOLOGY THAT'S

00:50:23.487 --> 00:50:26.857 region:rollup2
BEING USED FOR CHINA HAVE

00:50:25.189 --> 00:50:28.125 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES FOR DEALING LARGELY

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:29.627 region:rollup2
WITH BEHAVIORAL ISSUES IN

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:31.929 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH A IN THE GENERAL

00:50:29.627 --> 00:50:33.230 region:rollup2
EDUCATION CITING.

00:50:31.929 --> 00:50:34.365 region:rollup2
THE STATE PROVIDED THIRTY

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:35.866 region:rollup2
MILLION TO THESE TWO COUNTY

00:50:34.365 --> 00:50:37.635 region:rollup2
OFFICES TO DO WORK LIKE THIS

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:39.837 region:rollup2
JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. AND SO

00:50:37.635 --> 00:50:41.705 region:rollup2
IT'S UNCLEAR Y. THERE'S STILL AN

00:50:39.837 --> 00:50:43.107 region:rollup2
ISSUE OUT THERE WHAT EXACTLY IS

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:45.543 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OUT THERE.

00:50:43.107 --> 00:50:46.410 region:rollup2
AND MORE OVER SO THE

00:50:45.543 --> 00:50:47.945 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T REALLY

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:49.480 region:rollup2
TELL YOU WHAT IS ADDED WHAT'S

00:50:47.945 --> 00:50:50.948 region:rollup2
SPECIAL ABOUT THIS PART OF MONEY

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.550 region:rollup2
VERSUS THE THIRTY MILLION YARDI

00:50:50.948 --> 00:50:53.684 region:rollup2
PROVIDED. BUT IT WON'T GIVE YOU

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:55.319 region:rollup2
AN EXPENDITURE PLAN UNTIL

00:50:53.684 --> 00:50:56.487 region:rollup2
DECEMBER SO IT'S ASKING YOU TO

00:50:55.319 --> 00:50:57.821 region:rollup2
PROVE FIFTY MILLION YOU'RE NOT

00:50:56.487 --> 00:50:59.356 region:rollup2
REALLY GONNA KNOW HOW THE MONIES

00:50:57.821 --> 00:51:00.624 region:rollup2
WILL BE SPENT. AND YOU DON'T

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:02.393 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT UNIQUE PROBLEM YOU'RE

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:04.228 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SOLVE YOU WON'T BE

00:51:02.393 --> 00:51:05.796 region:rollup2
ABLE TO TRACK WHETHER YOU'VE

00:51:04.228 --> 00:51:06.630 region:rollup2
SOLVED AT A YEAR FROM NOW.

00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:08.165 region:rollup2
ON THE STRONG WORK FORCE

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:09.433 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IT'S A PRETTY MODEST

00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:11.268 region:rollup2
CHANGE TO JUST ADD THE TWO

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:12.102 region:rollup2
MILLION FOR ADMINISTRATION WE

00:51:11.268 --> 00:51:13.771 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO HAVE ALL THE SAME

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:15.739 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH HOT THROUGHOUT THE

00:51:13.771 --> 00:51:17.241 region:rollup2
YEAR WITH THE PROPOSAL.

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:18.976 region:rollup2
THE NEXT THREE PROPOSALS LISTED

00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:20.444 region:rollup2
ON FIGURE FOR OUR ALL WITH THIS

00:51:18.976 --> 00:51:22.313 region:rollup2
NEW SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR LOW

00:51:20.444 --> 00:51:23.881 region:rollup2
PERFORMING DISTRICTS.

00:51:22.313 --> 00:51:25.382 region:rollup2
THE MAY REVISION TRIES TO LAND A

00:51:23.881 --> 00:51:27.484 region:rollup2
LOT MORE CLARITY TO WHAT COUNTY

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:29.253 region:rollup2
OFFICES ARE DOING AND SO IF YOU

00:51:27.484 --> 00:51:30.421 region:rollup2
WANT COUNTIES TO BE AGAIN WE

00:51:29.253 --> 00:51:32.022 region:rollup2
WERE SUGGESTING YOU DON'T TAKE

00:51:30.421 --> 00:51:33.390 region:rollup2
THIS APPROACH BUT IF YOU DO IF

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:35.459 region:rollup2
YOU WANT COUNTIES TO BE THE CORE

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:36.927 region:rollup2
SUPPORT PROVIDER. WE THINK SOME

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:38.562 region:rollup2
OTHER CLARIFICATIONS ARE USEFUL

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:39.530 region:rollup2
AND YOU COULD GO EVEN FURTHER

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:42.333 region:rollup2
YOU COULD JUST CLARIFY THAT

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:43.834 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE THE ONES TO DO THAT

00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:46.003 region:rollup2
ON A VACATION OF ROOT CAUSES.

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:47.838 region:rollup2
THE PERFORMANCE DATA REVIEW AND

00:51:46.003 --> 00:51:49.640 region:rollup2
TO HELP IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT

00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:50.841 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES FOR REFORM. AND THEN

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:53.377 region:rollup2
YOU CAN HAVE THE COLLABORATIVE

00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:54.244 region:rollup2
GO AHEAD AND SUPPORT COUNTIES

00:51:53.377 --> 00:51:56.213 region:rollup2
AND HAVING THE CAPACITY TO DO

00:51:54.244 --> 00:51:58.415 region:rollup2
THAT. THEY'RE STILL THIS WHOLE

00:51:56.213 --> 00:52:00.784 region:rollup2
REGIONAL LEVEL THAT WE THINK IS

00:51:58.415 --> 00:52:01.885 region:rollup2
EXTRANEOUS AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:03.187 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF YOU DO BILL THAT

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:04.588 region:rollup2
REGIONAL LAYER YOU WON'T KNOW

00:52:03.187 --> 00:52:05.990 region:rollup2
WHO TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE IS THAT

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:07.424 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY IS THE RETURNS AT THE

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:08.092 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE THE ROLES BECOME

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:10.928 region:rollup2
VERY.

00:52:08.092 --> 00:52:11.996 region:rollup2
INTERTWINED IN A WAY THAT

00:52:10.928 --> 00:52:15.299 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY BECOMES ALMOST.

00:52:11.996 --> 00:52:16.600 region:rollup2
I WAS VERY VERY DIFFICULT.

00:52:15.299 --> 00:52:18.168 region:rollup2
THE LAST ONE IS FOR COMMUNITY

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.970 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENTS THIRTEEN MILLION

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:21.939 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR THE COLLABORATIVE TO

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.406 region:rollup2
DO PROFESSIONAL LEARNING

00:52:21.939 --> 00:52:23.674 region:rollup2
NETWORKS ON COMMUNITY

00:52:22.406 --> 00:52:24.742 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT.

00:52:23.674 --> 00:52:26.443 region:rollup2
THE COLLABORATIVE RIGHT NOW DOES

00:52:24.742 --> 00:52:28.145 region:rollup2
FIFTY SIX OF THE USE

00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:29.613 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL LEARNING NETWORKS.

00:52:28.145 --> 00:52:30.748 region:rollup2
SO WE THINK IF YOU REALLY WANT

00:52:29.613 --> 00:52:32.416 region:rollup2
ONE ARE MORE OF THEM TO DO

00:52:30.748 --> 00:52:33.817 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT YOU COULD

00:52:32.416 --> 00:52:34.685 region:rollup2
JUST WRITE BUDGET PROVISIONAL

00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:36.253 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE WITHIN THE

00:52:34.685 --> 00:52:37.588 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE AND DIRECT THEM TO

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:40.357 region:rollup2
DO THAT WE DON'T THINK THEY NEED

00:52:37.588 --> 00:52:42.059 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY FOR IT.

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:43.827 region:rollup2
YOUR AGENDA ALSO COVERS EARLY

00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:45.029 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND THERE'S ONLY

00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:46.330 region:rollup2
THERE'S FEWER ISSUES AND EARLY

00:52:45.029 --> 00:52:48.132 region:rollup2
HEAD BUT IF YOU TURN TO PAGE

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:50.134 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN. YOU CAN

00:52:48.132 --> 00:52:52.036 region:rollup2
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN CHILDCARE

00:52:50.134 --> 00:52:53.337 region:rollup2
AND PRESCHOOL.

00:52:52.036 --> 00:52:55.105 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU COMPARE THEM A REVISION

00:52:53.337 --> 00:52:58.008 region:rollup2
TO THE JANUARY BUDGETON THE

00:52:55.105 --> 00:52:59.243 region:rollup2
BOTTOM LINE NOT MUCH CHANGE.

00:52:58.008 --> 00:53:01.078 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU LOOK OVER AT FIGURE

00:52:59.243 --> 00:53:02.946 region:rollup2
SIX ON PAGE FIFTEEN YOU CAN SEE

00:53:01.078 --> 00:53:05.249 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON THAT'S

00:53:02.946 --> 00:53:06.550 region:rollup2
NETTING OUT TO A BOTTOM LINE

00:53:05.249 --> 00:53:09.420 region:rollup2
THAT WERE ISN'T CHANGING.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:10.521 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY MUCH.

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.789 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR FIGURE

00:53:10.521 --> 00:53:13.157 region:rollup2
SEVEN PAGE SIXTEEN I'M JUST

00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:14.658 region:rollup2
GONNA HIGHLIGHT THE BIG MOVING

00:53:13.157 --> 00:53:17.094 region:rollup2
PIECES SO THE BIGGEST ISSUE

00:53:14.658 --> 00:53:19.163 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU. IS THAT POWER X.

00:53:17.094 --> 00:53:20.698 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE ESTIMATES ARE COMING A

00:53:19.163 --> 00:53:21.765 region:rollup2
MUCH HIGHER THAN EXPECTED.

00:53:20.698 --> 00:53:23.467 region:rollup2
YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR THE

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:25.436 region:rollup2
STATE DID SOME PRETTY IMPORTANT

00:53:23.467 --> 00:53:27.271 region:rollup2
POLICY CHANGES THEY SAID RATHER

00:53:25.436 --> 00:53:29.073 region:rollup2
THAN A FAMILY HAVING TO MAINTAIN

00:53:27.271 --> 00:53:30.274 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR

00:53:29.073 --> 00:53:33.243 region:rollup2
THEY ONLY HAD TO MAINTAIN IT AT

00:53:30.274 --> 00:53:34.445 region:rollup2
A POINT IN TIME. DURING THE YEAR

00:53:33.243 --> 00:53:36.080 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY INCREASE

00:53:34.445 --> 00:53:37.614 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY THE STATE JUST HAD AN

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:39.616 region:rollup2
ENTRY AND EXIT THRESHOLD THAT

00:53:37.614 --> 00:53:41.552 region:rollup2
WAS A TENTACLE SEVENTY PERCENT

00:53:39.616 --> 00:53:42.619 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME. THE

00:53:41.552 --> 00:53:44.221 region:rollup2
STATE CREATED AN ACCESS

00:53:42.619 --> 00:53:45.656 region:rollup2
THRESHOLD WHICH WAS EIGHTY FIVE

00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:47.791 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE STATE MEDIAN

00:53:45.656 --> 00:53:49.093 region:rollup2
INCOME. AND THEY ALSO CHANGE THE

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:51.095 region:rollup2
INDEX THEY WERE USING FROM TWO

00:53:49.093 --> 00:53:52.596 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SEVEN INDEX TO A TWENTY

00:53:51.095 --> 00:53:53.964 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN AND DUCKS THIS MEANT

00:53:52.596 --> 00:53:54.965 region:rollup2
THAT THE EXIT THRESHOLD FOR A

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:56.967 region:rollup2
FAMILY OF THREE MOVE FROM

00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:58.102 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE FORTY THOUSAND TO

00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:59.870 region:rollup2
SIXTY THOUSAND.

00:53:58.102 --> 00:54:00.537 region:rollup2
SO THE ESTIMATES AT THE TIME OF

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:01.605 region:rollup2
WHAT IT WOULD COST TO DO THESE

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:03.774 region:rollup2
THINGS AGAIN WE'RE NOT

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:05.642 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY GOOD SO THE COSTS

00:54:03.774 --> 00:54:07.311 region:rollup2
ARE COMING AND SUBSTANTIALLY

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:08.812 region:rollup2
HIGHER. YOU JUST AROUND A

00:54:07.311 --> 00:54:10.614 region:rollup2
SECTION LETTER TO FUND A

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:12.216 region:rollup2
DEFICIENCY AND COWARDS CHILDCARE

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:13.884 region:rollup2
HERE A FEW WEEKS AGO. THE

00:54:12.216 --> 00:54:15.052 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION INCLUDES

00:54:13.884 --> 00:54:17.321 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION IN

00:54:15.052 --> 00:54:19.156 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR EIGHTEEN

00:54:17.321 --> 00:54:20.691 region:rollup2
NINETEEN TO COVER THESE COSTS.

00:54:19.156 --> 00:54:22.192 region:rollup2
AB BUT WE THINK IT'S FALLING

00:54:20.691 --> 00:54:23.827 region:rollup2
SHORT OF WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO

00:54:22.192 --> 00:54:25.829 region:rollup2
COVER THE COST WE THINK THE COST

00:54:23.827 --> 00:54:28.098 region:rollup2
IS PROBABLY AT LEAST FIFTY NOTES

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:30.067 region:rollup2
FIFTY MILLION MORE. AND THIS IS

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:31.702 region:rollup2
USING OUR CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES

00:54:30.067 --> 00:54:33.270 region:rollup2
WE THINK OCCUR COME ON IN AS

00:54:31.702 --> 00:54:34.338 region:rollup2
HIGH AS SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OR

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:35.639 region:rollup2
MORE.

00:54:34.338 --> 00:54:38.041 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU DON'T PROVIDE THE

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:39.209 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATION OF AN EXTRA FIFTY

00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:41.245 region:rollup2
YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF IN A

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:42.079 region:rollup2
POSITION SIX MONTHS FROM NOW

00:54:41.245 --> 00:54:43.413 region:rollup2
WHERE THE PROGRAM HAS A

00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:44.848 region:rollup2
SHORTFALL YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:46.350 region:rollup2
IF THERE ARE RESOURCES THAT THAT

00:54:44.848 --> 00:54:48.652 region:rollup2
TIME TO COVER IT WE DON'T

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:50.821 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND YOU COVER IT NOW.

00:54:48.652 --> 00:54:53.757 region:rollup2
FOR EARLY AND AND THERE'S NO

00:54:50.821 --> 00:54:55.025 region:rollup2
MAJOR CHANGES TO THE INITIATIVE

00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:56.326 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ALL OUR SING

00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:57.461 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE GOT A LOT

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:58.896 region:rollup2
OF MONEY YOU COULD BE USING FOR

00:54:57.461 --> 00:55:00.964 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT RIGHT

00:54:58.896 --> 00:55:01.598 region:rollup2
NOW TO HELP CHILD CARE PROVIDERS

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:02.299 region:rollup2
WORK WITH STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:03.567 region:rollup2
NEEDS.

00:55:02.299 --> 00:55:04.935 region:rollup2
SO YOU HAVE ABOUT NINETY THREE

00:55:03.567 --> 00:55:06.236 region:rollup2
MILLION YOU ARE THE PROVIDING

00:55:04.935 --> 00:55:08.906 region:rollup2
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT MONIES ABOUT

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:09.740 region:rollup2
HALF OF WHICH GOES TO TRAINING.

00:55:08.906 --> 00:55:11.175 region:rollup2
IN THE MAY REVISION THERE'S

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:13.277 region:rollup2
ANOTHER SEVENTEEN MILLION AND

00:55:11.175 --> 00:55:14.878 region:rollup2
FEDERAL CARRYOVER THAT IS

00:55:13.277 --> 00:55:16.180 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY USED FOR TRAINING.

00:55:14.878 --> 00:55:17.648 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE STATE WAS NOTIFIED

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:18.448 region:rollup2
JUST WITHIN THE LAST FEW MONTHS

00:55:17.648 --> 00:55:20.584 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S GOING TO GET TWO

00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:22.119 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION

00:55:20.584 --> 00:55:24.054 region:rollup2
BOTH IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND

00:55:22.119 --> 00:55:25.489 region:rollup2
AGAIN IN NINETEEN TWENTY. THAT

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:27.357 region:rollup2
IT CAN USE FOR A VARIETY OF

00:55:25.489 --> 00:55:28.792 region:rollup2
PURPOSES TRAINING BEING ONE SO

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:30.027 region:rollup2
WE THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF MONEY

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:31.395 region:rollup2
IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING LIKE

00:55:30.027 --> 00:55:32.629 region:rollup2
THIS IT'S JUST ATTACHING THE

00:55:31.395 --> 00:55:34.631 region:rollup2
MONEY AND THE PRIORITY THOUGHTS

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:36.533 region:rollup2
ARE IN YOUR BUDGET.

00:55:34.631 --> 00:55:38.569 region:rollup2
AND THEN LASTLY.

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:40.304 region:rollup2
SEDIA IS REQUESTING SOME MONEY

00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:42.573 region:rollup2
TO ADMINISTER THESE COUNTY PILOT

00:55:40.304 --> 00:55:43.473 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

00:55:42.573 --> 00:55:45.142 region:rollup2
I MEAN WE WERE JUST.

00:55:43.473 --> 00:55:46.777 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND YOU REVISIT IT NEXT

00:55:45.142 --> 00:55:48.178 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:55:46.777 --> 00:55:49.780 region:rollup2
CD GIVE US A PROPOSAL IN THE

00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:51.782 region:rollup2
FALL BUT IT WAS BEFORE YOU TOOK

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:53.817 region:rollup2
ACTION AND MAY I'M SORRY AND

00:55:51.782 --> 00:55:55.519 region:rollup2
MARCH TO STREAMLINE ASPECTS OF

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:56.954 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM SO IT SHOULD BE

00:55:55.519 --> 00:55:58.155 region:rollup2
EASIER FOR THEM TO ADMINISTRATE.

00:55:56.954 --> 00:55:59.456 region:rollup2
AND ADMINISTER THE PILOTS RIGHT

00:55:58.155 --> 00:56:00.991 region:rollup2
NOW THEY HAVE VERY SIMILAR RULES

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:02.659 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:04.094 region:rollup2
AND THAT INFORMATION WE'VE

00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:05.462 region:rollup2
GOTTEN TO DATE DOESN'T SPECIFY

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:06.964 region:rollup2
ALL THE THINGS THEY NO LONGER

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:08.198 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO BECAUSE THE COUNTIES

00:56:06.964 --> 00:56:09.833 region:rollup2
ARE IN THE PILOT AND NOT IN THE

00:56:08.198 --> 00:56:11.435 region:rollup2
REGULAR PROGRAM SO THERE'S ABOUT

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:12.436 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT OF THE SLOTS

00:56:11.435 --> 00:56:14.371 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE REGULAR

00:56:12.436 --> 00:56:15.806 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IN CD WOULD HAVE BEEN.

00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:17.174 region:rollup2
DOING WORK ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

00:56:15.806 --> 00:56:18.675 region:rollup2
AND HAVEN'T SORT OF BACKED OUT

00:56:17.174 --> 00:56:20.210 region:rollup2
THE SAVINGS TO GET FROM NO

00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:21.211 region:rollup2
LONGER HAVING TO DO THAT WORK SO

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:22.846 region:rollup2
IF THE DEPARTMENT WOULD COME

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:24.314 region:rollup2
BACK NEXT YEAR SORT OF NET OUT

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:25.682 region:rollup2
THEN YOU COULD REVISIT THAT THE

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:27.150 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL AT THAT TIME.

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.918 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S A REVIEW OF THE KEY

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:35.392 region:rollup2
TWELVE AND EARLY ADD ME REVISE

00:56:27.918 --> 00:56:38.095 region:rollup2
PURPLES.

00:56:35.392 --> 00:56:38.762 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:56:38.095 --> 00:56:39.329 region:rollup2
SURE NICK SCHWEITZER DEPARTMENT

SO YOU KNOW GENERALLY WERE WERE

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:44.601 region:rollup2
WERE POSITIVE ON THIS MAY

00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:47.170 region:rollup2
REVISION.

00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:48.772 region:rollup2
US START WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:50.507 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY VERY STRONGLY AS

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:52.509 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE STREAMLINED

00:56:50.507 --> 00:56:54.578 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION LANGUAGE.

00:56:52.509 --> 00:56:56.046 region:rollup2
WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT.

00:56:54.578 --> 00:56:57.781 region:rollup2
UNDER APPROPRIATIONS BE

00:56:56.046 --> 00:56:58.448 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY QUICKLY IN THAT MONEY

00:56:57.781 --> 00:57:00.817 region:rollup2
BE.

00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:03.086 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED TO SCHOOLS

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:04.888 region:rollup2
EXPEDITIOUSLY. ARE WE ALSO

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:06.556 region:rollup2

PRESCHOOL.

00:57:07.524 --> 00:57:11.395 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATION THAT WAS DONE A

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:14.064 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS AGO.

00:57:11.395 --> 00:57:15.899 region:rollup2
FINALLY WITH REGARD TO THE COST

00:57:14.064 --> 00:57:17.334 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION SCHEDULE WE BELIEVE

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:19.536 region:rollup2
THIS IS CERTAINLY A MUCH BETTER

00:57:17.334 --> 00:57:22.205 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER MECHANISMS

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:24.074 region:rollup2
THAT MAY. BE USED TO LIMIT OVER

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:26.610 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS SUCH AS CLAW

00:57:24.074 --> 00:57:29.479 region:rollup2
BACKS AND OR DELAYING.

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:30.547 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION OF FUNDS WHICH WE'VE

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:32.316 region:rollup2
SEEN PROPOSED IN THE PAST.

00:57:30.547 --> 00:57:34.051 region:rollup2
.

00:57:32.316 --> 00:57:34.685 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE WE VERY STRONGLY

00:57:34.051 --> 00:57:36.486 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE THE.

00:57:34.685 --> 00:57:36.687 region:rollup2
.

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:39.589 region:rollup2
THE.

00:57:36.687 --> 00:57:40.424 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION OF EL

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:43.527 region:rollup2
CFF AND THE.

00:57:40.424 --> 00:57:44.628 region:rollup2
GRANTING OF THE AUTOMATIC COOL

00:57:43.527 --> 00:57:45.963 region:rollup2
WAS.

00:57:44.628 --> 00:57:47.297 region:rollup2
WE THINK THESE ARE VERY

00:57:45.963 --> 00:57:50.434 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR THE CONTINUED

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:54.037 region:rollup2
STABILITY OF OF SCHOOL FUNDING.

00:57:50.434 --> 00:57:56.473 region:rollup2
WORK WITH REGARD TO THE EL PACK.

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:59.810 region:rollup2
HERE WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE THERE

00:57:56.473 --> 00:58:01.545 region:rollup2
IS A VALUE TO DELIVERING THAT

00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:03.113 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT VIA COMPUTERS AND WE

00:58:01.545 --> 00:58:04.648 region:rollup2
ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE

00:58:03.113 --> 00:58:06.850 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENT FOR THE

00:58:04.648 --> 00:58:08.618 region:rollup2
OPAC IS IS REQUIRED.

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:11.221 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTING

00:58:08.618 --> 00:58:12.222 region:rollup2
THE. THE EL PACK NEXT YEARS SO

00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:15.359 region:rollup2
IT'S AN IMPORTANT TO.

00:58:12.222 --> 00:58:16.326 region:rollup2
BEGIN NEW MOVING TO GET THOSE

00:58:15.359 --> 00:58:18.228 region:rollup2
THOSE PIECES IN PLACE.

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:19.496 region:rollup2
.

00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:22.232 region:rollup2

EDUCATION GENERAL WE'RE MOVING

00:58:30.907 --> 00:58:33.910 region:rollup2
TOWARDS INCLUSION EARLY

00:58:32.676 --> 00:58:35.178 region:rollup2
EDUCATION SHOULDN'T BE ANY

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:37.614 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:38.782 region:rollup2
BEYOND THIS THIS IS GOING TO

00:58:37.614 --> 00:58:41.251 region:rollup2
HELP SUPPORT.

00:58:38.782 --> 00:58:42.819 region:rollup2
MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION FOR

I'M.

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:46.923 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING ON EARLY HEAD

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:48.091 region:rollup2
IS WERE REGARD WITH REGARD TO

00:58:46.923 --> 00:58:50.060 region:rollup2

THEM WERE PROVED THAT LAST YEAR

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:54.731 region:rollup2
AND.

00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:57.768 region:rollup2
WE THINK THE THE FUNDING

00:58:54.731 --> 00:59:00.103 region:rollup2
PROVIDED TO US TOO AT BEGIN.

00:58:57.768 --> 00:59:01.638 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING THOSE THOSE PILOTS

00:59:00.103 --> 00:59:01.872 region:rollup2
IS IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR

MOVE FORWARD SUCCESSFULLY.

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:09.446 region:rollup2
THEN FINALLY.

00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:11.481 region:rollup2
WANNA CALL OUT ONE AREA OF

00:59:09.446 --> 00:59:13.517 region:rollup2
CONCERN CONTINUED CONCERN WITH

00:59:11.481 --> 00:59:14.251 region:rollup2
THE MAYOR VISION AND THAT IS OF

00:59:13.517 --> 00:59:17.254 region:rollup2
COURSE WITH THE.

ON MY FIRST QUESTION MAY BECOME

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:16.079 region:rollup2
AN A QUESTION ABOUT THE

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:17.581 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION OF PROP NINETY

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:19.382 region:rollup2
EIGHT GIVES ME A LOT OF CONCERN.

01:00:17.581 --> 01:00:21.284 region:rollup2
MY BASIC CONCERN IS THAT IF

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:21.852 region:rollup2
FURTHER EMPOWERS THE EXECUTIVE

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.487 region:rollup2
BRANCH OVER THE LEGISLATIVE

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:24.788 region:rollup2
BRANCH.

01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:26.189 region:rollup2
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS A BIT

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:27.591 region:rollup2
AYE CHANGES THAT SEE CHANGES THE

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:29.126 region:rollup2
PROCESS FOR CERTIFYING THE FINAL

01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:30.961 region:rollup2
CALCULATION.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:32.729 region:rollup2
PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR GUARANTEED

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:34.264 region:rollup2
THE GUARANTEE FOR PRIOR YEARS.

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:35.599 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IT'S DONE BY A TEAM

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:36.867 region:rollup2
RIGHT THE S. P. AYE DEPARTMENT

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:37.968 region:rollup2
OF FINANCE AND THE CHANCELLOR'S

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:40.370 region:rollup2
OFFICE ENGAGE IN THAT NOW IS

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:42.239 region:rollup2
THAT CORRECT.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:43.940 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE YES CORRECT CLICK

01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:44.474 region:rollup2
THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE SINCE

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.175 region:rollup2
THREE THOUSAND EIGHT NINE.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.309 region:rollup2
GREAT.

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:47.844 region:rollup2
.

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:49.779 region:rollup2
BUT THIS PROPOSAL LAWS TO PART

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:50.147 region:rollup2
OF FIGHTS ALONE. TO DETERMINE

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:52.382 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT LEVEL

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:59.556 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE.

01:00:52.382 --> 01:01:00.090 region:rollup2
IN THE LAST PART OF FINANCE TO

01:00:59.556 --> 01:01:00.757 region:rollup2
COUNT ANY FUNNY ABOVE THE

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.391 region:rollup2
MINIMUM GUARANTEE TO MEET FUTURE

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:02.025 region:rollup2
PROP NINETY EIGHT OBLIGATIONS.

01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:03.260 region:rollup2
SO YOU MIGHT MIGHT THEM INTO MY

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:04.761 region:rollup2
OVERALL PERCEPTION AGAIN AS IT

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.062 region:rollup2
EMPOWERS THE.

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:07.697 region:rollup2
REJECT EXECUTIVE BRANCH.

01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:09.1000 region:rollup2
MORE THAN.

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:12.302 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH.

01:01:09.1000 --> 01:01:13.970 region:rollup2
AND IT ALONE OF THE NET EFFECT

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:15.405 region:rollup2
WILL BE THAT IT IT MAKES THE

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:18.275 region:rollup2
PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE A

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:18.842 region:rollup2
MAXIMUM AS WELL AS A MINIMUM.

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:20.010 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IF WE INTEND TO GO

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:22.078 region:rollup2
ABOVE.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:23.313 region:rollup2
THE THE MINIMUM LEVEL.

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:25.448 region:rollup2
IN THEY'RE THERE'S BEEN A

01:01:23.313 --> 01:01:28.184 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS COURT CASE PREVIOUS

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:29.786 region:rollup2
COURT CASE NEW CTE VERSE CALL

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:31.354 region:rollup2
COOL WHERE I'D MIKE TO DO

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:32.756 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE IS BOTH SPEECHES JUST

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:33.256 region:rollup2
IF YOU COULD JUST WE CAN FINISH

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:36.293 region:rollup2
HIS THOUGHTS.

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:36.626 region:rollup2
THIS THIS CONFLICT WITH THAT IS

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:37.827 region:rollup2
THAT VIOLATE.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:39.796 region:rollup2
THAT AGREEMENT AGAIN WHAT'S

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:40.330 region:rollup2
WRONG WITH.

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:42.065 region:rollup2
FUNDING PROPOSITION NINETY

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:44.601 region:rollup2
EIGHT.

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:46.269 region:rollup2
OVER THE MINIMUM I OR FORTY SIX

01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:48.071 region:rollup2
THE NATION GIVE OR TAKE.

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:49.606 region:rollup2
ON A PER PUPIL FUNDING SO SO

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:50.540 region:rollup2
THIS THIS THIS PROPOSAL GIVES ME

01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:52.609 region:rollup2
A LOT OF CONCERN AND I'M

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:54.177 region:rollup2
WONDERING WHY ARE WE DOING THIS.

01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:55.312 region:rollup2
SO VIRTUAL Y. READING THIS

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:56.780 region:rollup2
SIGNAL WHAT YOU BELIEVE THEN

01:01:55.312 --> 01:01:58.582 region:rollup2
THAT AFFECTS BECAUSE AGAIN I I

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:00.050 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THE THE SEACM THAT

01:01:58.582 --> 01:02:01.585 region:rollup2
MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS THAT

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:02.218 region:rollup2
AGAIN IT EMPOWERS THE.

01:02:01.585 --> 01:02:04.721 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE ORDER THE LEGISLATIVE

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:06.456 region:rollup2
BRANCH.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:08.225 region:rollup2
IF I MAY ANSWER THAT QUESTION SO

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:09.526 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS REALLY IS NOT ON

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:10.860 region:rollup2
SIMILAR A IT IT'S VERY

01:02:09.526 --> 01:02:13.163 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'RE

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:15.799 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY DOING SO IT IN PAST

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:17.701 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATIONS OF THE THE S. P.

01:02:15.799 --> 01:02:19.236 region:rollup2
AYE THE CHANCELLOR'S. OFFICE

01:02:17.701 --> 01:02:20.704 region:rollup2
THEY PROVIDE FINANCE WITH ALL OF

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:23.373 region:rollup2
THE ALLOCATIONS APPROPRIATIONS

01:02:20.704 --> 01:02:25.442 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TAXES FTS IS IN A.

01:02:23.373 --> 01:02:26.876 region:rollup2
THEIR EIGHTY A AND SO THEY

01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:29.012 region:rollup2
WOULD COMPILE THAT INFORMATION

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:29.679 region:rollup2
BUT FINANCE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE

01:02:29.012 --> 01:02:31.948 region:rollup2
ONE THE KINDS THAT'S THE

01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:33.717 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE. WE AND THE FACTORS

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:34.384 region:rollup2
ARE ALL SAID IN LAW AS THEY

01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:37.354 region:rollup2
STAND SO.

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:39.356 region:rollup2
IT REALLY JUST MAKES IT A MORE

01:02:37.354 --> 01:02:40.090 region:rollup2
FORMAL PROCESS AND DOESN'T THEN

01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:41.424 region:rollup2
REQUIRE.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:42.626 region:rollup2
EVERYONE TO SIGN OFF ON IT IT

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.960 region:rollup2
JUST IT'S POSTED HOWEVER THERE

01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:45.662 region:rollup2
IS THAT PERIOD WHERE EVERYONE

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.631 region:rollup2
CAN.

01:02:45.662 --> 01:02:49.065 region:rollup2
SPEWED IT AND THAT.

01:02:47.631 --> 01:02:49.733 region:rollup2
AGAIN NOW IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT'S

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:51.267 region:rollup2
GOING ON NOW AT LEAST THE

01:02:49.733 --> 01:02:52.836 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION PROCESS WOULD BE

01:02:51.267 --> 01:02:54.838 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD SO THAT I DON'T

01:02:52.836 --> 01:02:55.972 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THERE'S ANY MORE POWER

01:02:54.838 --> 01:02:57.240 region:rollup2
TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WHICH

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:59.943 region:rollup2
THAT'S PRETTY CONSISTENT IT HAS

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:01.544 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY. BUT AGAIN WHY CHANGE

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.579 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE NO I

01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:04.347 region:rollup2
DON'T I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT

01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:06.616 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHES BY CHANGING THE

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:07.851 region:rollup2
EXISTING PROCESS OTHER THAN.

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:09.753 region:rollup2
SOLIDIFIES POWER.

01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:11.621 region:rollup2
ALSO THE EXISTING PROCESS THERE

01:03:09.753 --> 01:03:13.123 region:rollup2
IS IS NOT WORKING THIS IS WHY

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:15.191 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT BEEN CERTIFIED SINCE A

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:16.493 region:rollup2
NOT ABSENCE. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:17.694 region:rollup2
NINE BECAUSE THEY HAVE AGREED OF

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:19.095 region:rollup2
TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS

01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:20.196 region:rollup2
WORKING THERE'S SEVERAL PROBABLE

01:03:19.095 --> 01:03:21.731 region:rollup2
SO FIRST OF ALL THE PROCESS THE

01:03:20.196 --> 01:03:23.033 region:rollup2
NINE MONTH THE TIME FRAME IS TOO

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:24.134 region:rollup2
SHORT FINAL FACTORS ARE NOT

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:25.969 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE SO WE'D BE ACTUALLY

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:26.936 region:rollup2
CERTIFYING PRIOR TO EVEN HAVING

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:29.239 region:rollup2
THE LAST.

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:31.107 region:rollup2
LOOK AT REVENUE THAT'S.

01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:32.008 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:33.343 region:rollup2
YU CAN SEE IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:34.911 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WE JUST AT MAY

01:03:33.343 --> 01:03:36.279 region:rollup2
REVISION CHANGED REVENUES AND

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:37.781 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BY ONE POINT

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:39.215 region:rollup2
THREE BILLION DOLLARS SO. SO

01:03:37.781 --> 01:03:40.684 region:rollup2
THERE'S THAT AND THEN ALSO

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:41.951 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST BEEN ONGOING

01:03:40.684 --> 01:03:43.053 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION DIFFERENCES THIS

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:45.288 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST SORT OF FORCED THE

01:03:43.053 --> 01:03:47.490 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION TO HAPPEN ANNUALLY

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:49.292 region:rollup2
AND SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS NOW AS

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.460 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO. KICKING THAT. THESE

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:52.262 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS AND CANS DOWN THE

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:53.997 region:rollup2
ROAD TO DO YOU SEE THE NET

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:56.332 region:rollup2
RESULT.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:58.001 region:rollup2
IN IS THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT THE

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:59.602 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE WOULD BE A MAXIMUM WAS

01:03:58.001 --> 01:04:00.704 region:rollup2
WELL AS A MINIMUM THAT PUT THAT

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:02.272 region:rollup2
MINIMUM GUARANTEE CAN BE SET AT

01:04:00.704 --> 01:04:03.973 region:rollup2
ANY LEVEL THE LEGISLATURE

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:05.508 region:rollup2
DETERMINES IT TO BE SO YOU CAN

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:07.210 region:rollup2
OVER TO PROGRAM AND PROVIDE. YOU

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:08.411 region:rollup2
CAN PROVIDE AS MUCH AS YOU WANT

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:09.446 region:rollup2
TO THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED THIS

01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:10.947 region:rollup2
JUST GIVES THE STATE SOME

01:04:09.446 --> 01:04:12.182 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY WHEN THE WHEN WE

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:13.183 region:rollup2
CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THAT

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:14.317 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL AMOUNT.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:16.219 region:rollup2
SO THE MINIMUM GUARANTEES OF

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:18.788 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATED REVENUES.

01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:20.256 region:rollup2
DROP SUBSTANTIALLY MAY GIVE SOME

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:22.425 region:rollup2
LIMITED FLEXIBILITY AGAIN THE

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:24.594 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT CAP WOULD ONLY ALLOW

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:26.162 region:rollup2
THAT JUST WENT UP TO YOU KNOW IN

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:27.997 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ABOUT SEVEN

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:28.631 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS.

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:29.966 region:rollup2
DO ANY OTHERS WAS STILL PLAYING

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:32.469 region:rollup2
ON THE.

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:33.403 region:rollup2
DELEO. NOT OR MAYBE JUST A YOU

01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:34.671 region:rollup2
KNOW THIRTY OF ONE PERSPECTIVE

01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:37.240 region:rollup2
ON THE POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE

01:04:34.671 --> 01:04:39.042 region:rollup2
BRANCH THE WAY THAT THE PROCESS.

01:09:48.251 --> 01:09:50.319 region:rollup2
I JUST WORRY THAT WE'RE CREATING

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:52.355 region:rollup2
MORE HURDLES AND MORE

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:53.956 region:rollup2

TAKE WERE SEEKING TO TAKE THAT

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:04.367 region:rollup2
ELECTRONIC.

01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:05.568 region:rollup2
IN SO TALK TO ME ABOUT THE

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:07.270 region:rollup2
TIMELINE BECAUSE THERE'S AN

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:08.738 region:rollup2
ISSUES IN THE PAST.

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:08.938 region:rollup2
AND KEY TWELVE SCHOOL STRIDES

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:11.541 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:10:08.938 --> 01:10:13.810 region:rollup2
IN IDENTIFYING STUDENTS AND.

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:15.278 region:rollup2
IN ASSESSING THEM IN A CERTAIN

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:16.579 region:rollup2
TIMEFRAME.

01:10:15.278 --> 01:10:18.648 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE GET THEM RECLASSIFIED

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:19.215 region:rollup2
IF NEED BE CAN YOU CAN YOU SPEAK

01:10:18.648 --> 01:10:21.417 region:rollup2
TO HOW HOW THAT'S GOING TO

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:22.518 region:rollup2
IMPACT. OUR COMPORT WITH EFFORTS

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:23.653 region:rollup2
TO GET THE TEST IN AN EFFECTIVE

01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:25.488 region:rollup2
MANNER.

01:10:23.653 --> 01:10:27.190 region:rollup2
DO YOU KNOW TODAY.

01:10:25.488 --> 01:10:29.092 region:rollup2
I'M AND HASN'T BEEN ARTICULATED

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:31.928 region:rollup2
TO US THAT AN OBJECTIVE OF

01:10:29.092 --> 01:10:33.796 region:rollup2
MOVING FROM PAPER TO COMPUTER.

01:10:31.928 --> 01:10:35.531 region:rollup2
IS TO.

01:10:33.796 --> 01:10:37.166 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY EXPEDITE

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:38.835 region:rollup2
REDESIGNATIONS ALTHOUGH A

01:10:37.166 --> 01:10:40.203 region:rollup2
COMPUTER BASED SYSTEM THEY DO

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:42.004 region:rollup2
TONS OF BE ABLE TO TRANSFER

01:10:40.203 --> 01:10:44.640 region:rollup2
INFORMATION MORE QUICKLY TO

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:45.808 region:rollup2
TEACHERS SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.844 region:rollup2
IF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD

01:10:45.808 --> 01:10:50.279 region:rollup2
AMENDED ADS ELT AND RE

01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:51.347 region:rollup2
CLASSIFICATION POLICIES. THAT

01:10:50.279 --> 01:10:52.782 region:rollup2
JUST BY HAVING BY VIRTUE OF

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:55.118 region:rollup2
HAVING THEM FOR MISSION MORE

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:56.519 region:rollup2
QUICKLY THEY COULD RE DOESN'T ME

01:10:55.118 --> 01:10:57.920 region:rollup2
SOONER BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S

01:10:56.519 --> 01:10:59.255 region:rollup2
A REQUIREMENT THAT THEY GO THAT

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.990 region:rollup2
NEXT STEP AND JUST BECAUSE THE

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:03.359 region:rollup2
TEACHER HAS THE BENEFIT OF THE

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:04.527 region:rollup2
DATA. THAT IT'S TRANSFERRED TO

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:07.363 region:rollup2
THE NEXT TEACHER AND NOT RE

01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:08.998 region:rollup2
CLASSIFICATION OCCURS OR

01:11:07.363 --> 01:11:10.500 region:rollup2
DESIGNATION ACROSS MORE QUICKLY.

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:11.667 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN THE PROPOSAL IS COMING

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.235 region:rollup2
PRETTY QUICK BEFORE THE

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:14.670 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SO I'M NOT SURE

01:11:12.235 --> 01:11:15.304 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.939 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA GET A LOT OF DETAIL

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:18.141 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.908 region:rollup2
I HOPE SOMEONE HAS MORE NOT

01:11:18.141 --> 01:11:20.209 region:rollup2
COUNTING ON YOU TO HAVE THEM

01:11:18.908 --> 01:11:22.278 region:rollup2
TODAY UP.

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:23.546 region:rollup2
BUT SO SO.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:25.114 region:rollup2

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:30.520 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE RESULTS ARE SENT TO

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:32.088 region:rollup2
A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR WHO THEN

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:08.364 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE WITH WHAT THAT.

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:10.299 region:rollup2

01:16:12.835 --> 01:16:15.371 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE REGARDING THE

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:17.706 region:rollup2

01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:18.674 region:rollup2
TO MAKE ANY. DECISIONS AS TO

01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:20.576 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT IT WOULD NOT BE

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:22.478 region:rollup2
APPLICABLE. FAIR ENOUGH.

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:24.747 region:rollup2
DID DID LA ALL HAVE ANY THOUGHTS

01:16:22.478 --> 01:16:26.615 region:rollup2
ON THAT I AM. OUR UNDERSTANDING

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:29.685 region:rollup2
AND TERMS OF USE OF THE FUNDS AS

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:31.053 region:rollup2
THAT. OF THE REGULAR. BLOCK

01:16:29.685 --> 01:16:32.521 region:rollup2
GRANT RULES APPLY.

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:34.123 region:rollup2
BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO BE IN

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:36.325 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE REGULAR

01:16:34.123 --> 01:16:38.394 region:rollup2
RULES AND CALIFORNIA A FEW YEARS

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:40.062 region:rollup2
AGO WAS FOUND NOT TO BE IN

01:16:38.394 --> 01:16:41.497 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE NO NO STATE WAS IN

01:16:40.062 --> 01:16:42.498 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE BECAUSE THEY HAD JUST

01:16:41.497 --> 01:16:43.833 region:rollup2
CHANGED THE RULES AND THE

01:16:42.498 --> 01:16:45.468 region:rollup2
FEDERAL RULES ARE NOW MUCH MORE

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:47.203 region:rollup2
STRINGENT FOR EXAMPLE DOING

01:16:45.468 --> 01:16:49.105 region:rollup2
ANNUAL. INSPECTIONS RATHER THAN

01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:51.073 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS PERIODICALLY WHEN

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:52.875 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS AROSE SO I THINK THE

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:54.176 region:rollup2
BIG DEBATE IS OUR UNDERSTANDING

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:56.479 region:rollup2
AS YOU VERY LIKELY COULD USE

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:59.114 region:rollup2
THAT FOR SLOTS FOR RATES FOR

01:16:56.479 --> 01:17:00.649 region:rollup2
TRAINING. FOR MAYBE EVEN

01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:01.417 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:03.452 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO BE

01:17:01.417 --> 01:17:04.520 region:rollup2
MAKING YOU GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:05.688 region:rollup2
DO WHAT THE FUNDS WOULD LIKE IF

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.522 region:rollup2
THEY HAD DONE A FINE BUT THEY

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:09.658 region:rollup2
REALLY DID WANT YOU TO DO

01:17:06.522 --> 01:17:11.727 region:rollup2
SOMETHING MORE WITH INSPECTIONS.

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:13.362 region:rollup2
OR OR NOT DO THINGS WITH LICENSE

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:15.231 region:rollup2
EXEMPTS YOU MIGHT NEED TO MAKE

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:16.298 region:rollup2
SOME CHANGES ON THOSE AREAS. BUT

01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:17.566 region:rollup2
IT'S A GREAT THING TO BE

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:19.301 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT WE KNOW WE'RE

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:21.470 region:rollup2
GONNA AS A STATE GET MORE MONEY

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:22.805 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY IN BOTH THE STE

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:24.140 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND NEXT YEAR

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:25.508 region:rollup2
SO TO BE THINKING ABOUT WITHIN

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.942 region:rollup2
THOSE BROAD PARAMETERS WHAT

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:28.978 region:rollup2
YOU'RE HIGHS PRODUCE WOULD BE.

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:31.347 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:33.282 region:rollup2
TODD. HOW QUICK JUMP REAL QUICK

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:35.751 region:rollup2
TO CT  <u><c.green>I KNOW MR O'DONNELL</c></u>

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:36.285 region:rollup2
TALKS ABOUT IT SO WE WE HAD A?

01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:39.021 region:rollup2
LENGTHY HEARING ABOUT THIS

01:17:36.285 --> 01:17:39.221 region:rollup2
TWICE.

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:41.524 region:rollup2
AND.

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:44.927 region:rollup2
ARE TWO ISSUES WERE WHERE THE

01:17:41.524 --> 01:17:46.495 region:rollup2
DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND DONE AND THE.

01:17:44.927 --> 01:17:47.530 region:rollup2
AT THE LOCATION WHETHER IT'S

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:49.498 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE NEW PROPOSAL OR

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:50.132 region:rollup2
GOING BACK TO CD.

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:51.667 region:rollup2
IT'S I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:54.470 region:rollup2
FINANCE WAS LOOKING AT THAT AND

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:55.704 region:rollup2
SO. DON'T ASK CD <u><c.green>.</c></u>

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:58.007 region:rollup2
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS MEETS.

01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:59.542 region:rollup2
THE SUGGESTION THAT YOU LAID

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:01.944 region:rollup2
OUT EARLIER IN THE YEAR.

01:17:59.542 --> 01:18:03.579 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE IMPLEMENTATION.

01:18:01.944 --> 01:18:05.147 region:rollup2
AND THE OVERSEER OF THE OF THE

01:18:03.579 --> 01:18:07.349 region:rollup2
PROGRAM YEAH SO.

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:08.817 region:rollup2
I GUESS NO I MEAN THAT'S

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:10.419 region:rollup2
GENERALLY WHAT SO MUCH OF MY

01:18:08.817 --> 01:18:12.021 region:rollup2
COMMENTS WERE I MEAN WE

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:13.622 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE.

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:17.293 region:rollup2
THE THE EFFORT.

01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:19.228 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW WE WE STILL THINK.

01:18:17.293 --> 01:18:20.563 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY WE THINK WHERE WE

01:18:19.228 --> 01:18:21.063 region:rollup2
WOULD BE BETTER POSITIONED TO

01:18:20.563 --> 01:18:23.098 region:rollup2
ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM.

01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:25.634 region:rollup2
YEAH

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:27.937 region:rollup2
AND DO YOU THINK THAT IF WE WERE

01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:29.838 region:rollup2
ABLE TO PUT MORE RESOURCES.

01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:31.907 region:rollup2
ON THE TABLE FOR THIS THAT YOU

01:18:29.838 --> 01:18:34.610 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO.

01:18:31.907 --> 01:18:35.110 region:rollup2
TO YEAH EXPAND ACCESS TO CT

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:37.513 region:rollup2
THREE DISTRICTS ACROSS

CALIFORNIA. ARE I WOULD EXPECT

01:18:37.513 --> 01:18:40.549 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS PROBABLY

01:18:39.114 --> 01:18:42.818 region:rollup2
YES BUT I NEED A PRIDE NEED TO

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:44.753 region:rollup2
DOUBLE CHECK.

01:18:42.818 --> 01:18:46.088 region:rollup2
FAIR ENOUGH.

I AM NOT CLEAR.

01:19:12.548 --> 01:19:17.419 region:rollup2
WHY THE CHOICES BEING MADE TO

01:19:15.217 --> 01:19:20.155 region:rollup2
HOLD ㎿

OUT AGAIN AS AS A MAJOR EARLIER

01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:28.764 region:rollup2
IS REALLY A MATTER OF NOT HAVING

AMOUNT.

01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:37.439 region:rollup2
AND AND AGAIN NOT BEING IN

THE CCTV G. REGULATIONS AS THEY

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:42.444 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY STAND AND WHAT IS THE

01:19:40.676 --> 01:19:44.413 region:rollup2
TIMELINE FOR THAT.

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:31.293 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WE HAVE IS THAT

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:32.394 region:rollup2
COMES UP WE ARE NOT SURE WAY AND

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:33.962 region:rollup2
I FEDERAL GRANTS WILL BE

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:35.564 region:rollup2
RELEASED AND WHEN WILL THAT

01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:38.867 region:rollup2
FUNDING HAD CALIFORNIA. I WILL

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:40.135 region:rollup2
NEVER FIRST I HAVE TO DEFER TO

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:43.505 region:rollup2
THE PART OF A COMPLETE BECAUSE

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:45.541 region:rollup2
I'M I'M NOT SO WITH THAT TIGHTLY

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:46.675 region:rollup2
AS.

01:20:45.541 --> 01:20:48.911 region:rollup2
I HAVE TO DIFFERENT DIFFERENT

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:51.346 region:rollup2
APARTMENT HE'S AYE AND I THINK

01:20:48.911 --> 01:20:53.982 region:rollup2
THAT THAT DIDN'T DO WE NOW.

01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:54.616 region:rollup2
IT IT UNNATURAL TYPE OF THE ROAD

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:58.821 region:rollup2
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER RIGHT NOW

01:20:54.616 --> 01:21:00.723 region:rollup2
OCTOBER FIRST SO I DON'T KNOW

01:20:58.821 --> 01:21:01.957 region:rollup2
IF.

01:21:00.723 --> 01:21:04.793 region:rollup2
THAT'S FOR THE FALL AND I WOULD

01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:07.196 region:rollup2
HATE TO HOLD OFF SO I'M USING IT

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:08.230 region:rollup2
ON HER AND NOT YOU KNOW I SEE IT

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:08.831 region:rollup2
AS AN INVESTMENT.

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:10.833 region:rollup2
AND SO I GUESS THAT'S WHY MY

01:21:08.831 --> 01:21:11.967 region:rollup2
QUESTION START WITH WHY ARE WE

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:12.634 region:rollup2
NOT MAKING THE INVESTMENT AND I

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:13.102 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:15.971 region:rollup2
BEEN VERY IMPORTANT.

01:21:13.102 --> 01:21:16.805 region:rollup2
FOR AND NUMBER OF MEMBERS IN

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:18.273 region:rollup2
BOTH HOUSES.

01:21:16.805 --> 01:21:18.774 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT SO I

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:21.443 region:rollup2
WANNA.

01:21:18.774 --> 01:21:22.778 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE US TO REALLY THINK

01:21:21.443 --> 01:21:24.580 region:rollup2
ABOUT INVESTING THAT MANY.

01:21:22.778 --> 01:21:26.949 region:rollup2
EVEN IF IT'S ONE TIME MANY

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:27.983 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THE FUNDS

01:21:26.949 --> 01:21:29.551 region:rollup2
I'M IN THIS SPACE I WORKED AS

01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:30.386 region:rollup2
ONE YEAR WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:31.920 region:rollup2
AT A TIME.

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:33.856 region:rollup2
AT AND SO I THINK THE TWO

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:37.426 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS

01:21:33.856 --> 01:21:39.161 region:rollup2
AT AN EFFORT THAT REALLY HIGH

01:21:37.426 --> 01:21:42.664 region:rollup2
PRIEST MARRIOTT'S. AT FULL

01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:43.165 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF. OF

YOU FAST IMPLEMENTATION

01:21:43.165 --> 01:21:47.269 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

01:21:45.701 --> 01:21:48.570 region:rollup2
AND IF A FIVE MIGHT CLARIFY A OF

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:51.373 region:rollup2
THE ARE INTENT HERE IS NOT TO

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:52.307 region:rollup2
NOT USE THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:53.809 region:rollup2
LATE AUGMENTATION BUT RATHER

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:55.444 region:rollup2
JUST IT TO HOLD OFF AND IN ORDER

01:21:53.809 --> 01:21:57.846 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

01:21:55.444 --> 01:21:58.981 region:rollup2
OF. OF THE RULES REGULATIONS

01:21:57.846 --> 01:22:00.182 region:rollup2

ACADEMIC YEAR YEAH EIGHTEEN

01:22:02.618 --> 01:22:05.854 region:rollup2
NINETEEN A WERE REALLY SUCKS

01:22:04.453 --> 01:22:07.389 region:rollup2

BUT IT GO THROUGH A

01:22:07.389 --> 01:22:09.792 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTARY DEL PROCESS OR BE

CHAVEZ.

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:19.234 region:rollup2

DEALING WITH WITH THE FEDERAL.

01:22:19.234 --> 01:22:20.836 region:rollup2
IS THAT DAD THEY DEAL WITH A

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:22.137 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FISCAL YEAR THAN

01:22:20.836 --> 01:22:23.939 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:26.308 region:rollup2
SO THERE FISCAL YEAR STARTS IN

THAT IT'S CRACKED.

01:22:30.379 --> 01:22:34.149 region:rollup2
THE EVAN.

01:22:32.214 --> 01:22:35.317 region:rollup2

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:36.952 region:rollup2
OF EARLY CHILD EDUCATION

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:38.320 region:rollup2

THE REPUBLICANS. FOR A NUMBER OF

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:43.058 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:43.926 region:rollup2
SO AS YOU GO BACK AND WORK ON

ABOUT WE WANT TO INCREASE

01:22:47.396 --> 01:22:51.600 region:rollup2

OCCASION. I KNOW THIS IS BEEN A

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.102 region:rollup2
PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION I'VE

01:22:52.868 --> 01:22:55.571 region:rollup2
HAD THIS WITH THE GOVERNOR FEW

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:57.806 region:rollup2
TIMES ON YOU KNOW.

01:22:55.571 --> 01:22:59.875 region:rollup2
THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN THINGS

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:01.276 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT. BUT UGH WILL LIKE TO

01:22:59.875 --> 01:23:04.112 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO DO THAT.

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:07.483 region:rollup2
NAM FIGURE FIVE OF THE.

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:08.917 region:rollup2
KELLY ó REPORT.

01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:09.918 region:rollup2
IT TALKS ABOUT THE FEDERAL

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:11.854 region:rollup2
TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:13.889 region:rollup2
FAMILIES.

01:23:11.854 --> 01:23:14.489 region:rollup2
GONE FROM THREE EIGHTY NINE TO.

01:23:13.889 --> 01:23:16.859 region:rollup2
MAY REVISE AS THREE THIRTY LAS

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:19.061 region:rollup2
A.

01:23:16.859 --> 01:23:21.930 region:rollup2
FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS.

01:23:19.061 --> 01:23:23.665 region:rollup2
WHAT?

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:24.333 region:rollup2
IS THAT WHY WAS THAT REDUCE

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:26.802 region:rollup2
SHOULD YOU NINE MILLION DOLLARS.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:32.674 region:rollup2
HELLO.

01:23:26.802 --> 01:23:33.642 region:rollup2
I'M HERE FIGURE FIVE.

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.943 region:rollup2
I'M NOT ASKING YOU CAN YOU POINT

01:23:33.642 --> 01:23:35.477 region:rollup2
YOUR WHERE YEAH YEAH I'M SORRY

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:36.945 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I AM I'M

01:23:35.477 --> 01:23:39.281 region:rollup2
SORRY.

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:41.917 region:rollup2
WORKING TNF IS USED ENTIRELY

01:23:39.281 --> 01:23:44.520 region:rollup2
FOR STAGE ONE CHILD CARE IN AND

01:23:41.917 --> 01:23:46.221 region:rollup2
SO IT BECOMES INVOLVED IN HOUSE

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.756 region:rollup2
STAGE ONE IS FUNDED WHICH AS I

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:50.359 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT AS. PART OF THE

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:52.561 region:rollup2
SINGLE COUNTY ALLOCATION.

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:54.529 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:56.298 region:rollup2
CONNECTED WITH WHAT'S HPPENING

01:23:54.529 --> 01:23:58.267 region:rollup2
TO OVERALL CAO WORKS

01:23:56.298 --> 01:24:00.168 region:rollup2
CASELOAD WHICH IS DECLINING FROM

01:23:58.267 --> 01:24:02.738 region:rollup2
JANUARY TO MAY OVERALL CAL WORKS

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:04.006 region:rollup2
CASELOAD AND THE CHILD

01:24:02.738 --> 01:24:05.607 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED STAGE ONE CHILD CARE

01:24:04.006 --> 01:24:06.775 region:rollup2
IS PROBABLY GONE DOWN SUCH THAT.

01:24:05.607 --> 01:24:08.110 region:rollup2
THE WAY THE STATE TRADITIONALLY

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:10.679 region:rollup2
BUDGETS THAT IS YOU STAND UP

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:12.114 region:rollup2
JUST FOR THAT PARTICULAR STAGE.

01:24:10.679 --> 01:24:13.382 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S MORE OF A

01:24:12.114 --> 01:24:15.250 region:rollup2
MECHANICAL ADJUSTMENT FOR HOW WE

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:16.652 region:rollup2
ASSESS.

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:18.253 region:rollup2
FUNDS STREAMS ACROSS THE

01:24:16.652 --> 01:24:18.820 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND AS A STATE WE'VE

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:20.589 region:rollup2
JUST CHOSEN TO USE THAT FOR

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:21.590 region:rollup2
STAGE ONE.

01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:22.491 region:rollup2
AS FOR I THOUGHT BECAUSE OF MY

01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:24.293 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING.

01:24:22.491 --> 01:24:26.461 region:rollup2
THERE'S A POT.

01:24:24.293 --> 01:24:27.829 region:rollup2
HUMAN RESOURCES AND PART OF

01:24:26.461 --> 01:24:30.132 region:rollup2
EDUCATION USE AND I WAS

01:24:27.829 --> 01:24:30.532 region:rollup2
WONDERING HAS BEEN SHIFTED OVER

01:24:30.132 --> 01:24:32.034 region:rollup2
THERE AWAY FROM.

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:33.201 region:rollup2
THIS

01:24:32.034 --> 01:24:36.471 region:rollup2
POT IS THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:38.674 region:rollup2
HALF FOR MANY YEARS VAST BULK OF

01:24:36.471 --> 01:24:39.975 region:rollup2
TANNA FRANCE GONE TO STAGE ONE I

01:24:38.674 --> 01:24:41.843 region:rollup2
THINK THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A

01:24:39.975 --> 01:24:46.014 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS WHERE SLIVER WAS

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:47.616 region:rollup2
USED FOR STATES TO. BATES.

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:48.417 region:rollup2
SO YOU ARE TALKING AB PART OF

01:24:47.616 --> 01:24:50.118 region:rollup2
FINANCE WHERE THE MONEY WENT.

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:51.720 region:rollup2
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT THE STAGE

01:24:50.118 --> 01:24:53.355 region:rollup2
ONE ALLOCATION AFTER TO FIRE AT

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:55.958 region:rollup2
YOU MAY SOCIAL SERVICES

01:24:53.355 --> 01:24:57.826 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES UP ON THAT.

01:24:55.958 --> 01:24:59.661 region:rollup2
OKAY I'M. ON TO ANOTHER AREA OF

01:24:57.826 --> 01:25:01.396 region:rollup2
INTEREST TO ME.

01:24:59.661 --> 01:25:03.532 region:rollup2
IN NOT ESPECIALLY THE REPUBLIC

01:25:01.396 --> 01:25:05.534 region:rollup2
CAUCUS IN AS CAREER TECHNICAL

01:25:03.532 --> 01:25:08.670 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:25:05.534 --> 01:25:10.405 region:rollup2
THE.

01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:10.939 region:rollup2
I'M LOOKING AT THE SHEET WAS

01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:12.374 region:rollup2
GIVEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:15.944 region:rollup2
FINANCE.

01:25:12.374 --> 01:25:16.845 region:rollup2
THE FRONT PAGE FIGURE FOR YES.

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:18.947 region:rollup2
AND I'M TRYING TO FIND SHE G. E.

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:20.515 region:rollup2
IN HERE.

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:22.751 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T SEE IT NOW I

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:23.919 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THIS IS A CHANGE.

01:25:22.751 --> 01:25:25.721 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT WE ORIGINALLY HAD SHE

01:25:23.919 --> 01:25:27.956 region:rollup2
KEY WAS DISCUSSED BEFORE IS SHE

01:25:25.721 --> 01:25:31.126 region:rollup2
TEAM EBAY IMPOSTER ANYMORE. WHAT

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:33.795 region:rollup2
WE DON'T IT?

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:35.631 region:rollup2
SO I IT IT'S LISTED AS K. TWELVE

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:37.532 region:rollup2
STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IN ITS

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:40.135 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILLION

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:41.737 region:rollup2
DOLLARS UNDER THE ONGOING.

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:44.072 region:rollup2
IT'S YOUR THIRD ITEM DOWN IN THE

01:25:41.737 --> 01:25:45.641 region:rollup2
ON GOING K. TWELVE SECTIONS TO

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:47.809 region:rollup2
HER FOURTEEN MILLION TOTAL.

01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:49.311 region:rollup2
MMHM.

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:50.812 region:rollup2
SO OUR PROPOSAL IS NOT NURSES AT

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:52.080 region:rollup2
A AND WERE WERE WORKING IT AND

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:53.348 region:rollup2
IT'S QUIRK CALLING THAT THE

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:55.317 region:rollup2
STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IT'S

01:25:53.348 --> 01:25:55.884 region:rollup2
GREAT TECHNICAL EDUCATION BUT IT

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:57.753 region:rollup2
HAS A DIFFERENT FOCUS THEN.

01:25:55.884 --> 01:25:59.087 region:rollup2
WHEN.

01:25:57.753 --> 01:25:59.955 region:rollup2
FOR THERE IS TWO MILLION THAT

01:25:59.087 --> 01:26:01.590 region:rollup2
THAT THE CLEAN MILLIONS THE

01:25:59.955 --> 01:26:03.692 region:rollup2
ADDITION BECAUSE.

01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:04.426 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE ADDITION OF US SOME

01:26:03.692 --> 01:26:05.394 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS TO GO TO THE REGIONAL

01:26:04.426 --> 01:26:07.829 region:rollup2
CONSORTIA IT'S FOR

01:26:05.394 --> 01:26:09.331 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:11.033 region:rollup2
SO THE NUMBER WE HAD DISCUSSED

01:26:09.331 --> 01:26:12.868 region:rollup2
BEFORE WAS A LOT BIGGER THAN TWO

01:26:11.033 --> 01:26:14.836 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION IT WAS YEAH THAT

01:26:12.868 --> 01:26:18.006 region:rollup2
THEY THEY COMMITTEE YEAH WE WE

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:18.340 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED A HIGHER NUMBER AND

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:20.108 region:rollup2
CHANGING THE.

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:22.044 region:rollup2
.

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:23.412 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION FROWNED.

01:26:22.044 --> 01:26:26.782 region:rollup2
WE ARE GOING BACK TO WHERE IT

01:26:23.412 --> 01:26:28.350 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN LAST YEAR'S AND IN CD.

01:26:26.782 --> 01:26:29.851 region:rollup2
SO I HAD TO CHARGE THAT BECAUSE

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:31.820 region:rollup2
I WAS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WEEKS

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:33.388 region:rollup2
BUDGET WAS SIGNED ON TO THAT.

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:35.023 region:rollup2
NOW WAIT I GUESS TO FORTY TWO

01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:36.158 region:rollup2
ONE OF FOURTEEN MILLION RICE THE

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:37.626 region:rollup2
TUNER FOURTEEN IS THE AMOUNT

01:26:36.158 --> 01:26:38.627 region:rollup2
THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE

01:26:37.626 --> 01:26:40.095 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:41.329 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND WE WANTED HIGHER

01:26:40.095 --> 01:26:42.698 region:rollup2
NUMBER AND SO THE GOVERNOR'S

01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:43.198 region:rollup2
WILL NOT THIS NUMBER IS THAT

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:45.634 region:rollup2
WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT'S

01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:47.035 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

01:26:45.634 --> 01:26:48.470 region:rollup2
BURNETT FOR NOW.

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:49.871 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE IN AGREEMENT THAT WE'RE

01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:51.173 region:rollup2
GOING BACK AND PUSH IN ON EARLY

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:53.275 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND SEEKING

01:26:51.173 --> 01:26:53.909 region:rollup2
EASE I. JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT

01:26:53.275 --> 01:26:55.811 region:rollup2
STATEMENT.

01:26:53.909 --> 01:26:58.180 region:rollup2
AND THERE WAS ONE OTHER AREA.

01:26:55.811 --> 01:27:01.283 region:rollup2
THE CHARTER SCHOOL GRANTS.

01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:03.418 region:rollup2
.

01:27:01.283 --> 01:27:03.885 region:rollup2
IN THE HOLISTIC VIEW.

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:04.453 region:rollup2
I'M TO BRING EVERYBODY

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:07.789 region:rollup2
APPARENTLY.

01:27:04.453 --> 01:27:11.093 region:rollup2
IT'S GOT A.

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:14.262 region:rollup2
I'M THE NICE GUY BY THE WAY.

01:27:11.093 --> 01:27:14.796 region:rollup2
IS MY LAST HEARING YEAH.

01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:16.131 region:rollup2
SO WE COULD CHARTER SCHOOL

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:18.133 region:rollup2
GRANT.

01:27:16.131 --> 01:27:19.968 region:rollup2
.

01:27:18.133 --> 01:27:21.236 region:rollup2
IS IT A PLUS UP OR DOWN OVERALL

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:22.404 region:rollup2
AND ALL THE MOVEMENT IN NUMBERS

01:27:21.236 --> 01:27:23.505 region:rollup2
AND.

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:24.940 region:rollup2
THAT TWENTY ONE POINT FOUR

01:27:23.505 --> 01:27:26.775 region:rollup2
MILLION ONE TIME FUNDING AND

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:28.009 region:rollup2
THEN.

01:27:26.775 --> 01:27:30.245 region:rollup2
CHARTER SCHOOL OFFICIALLY GRANT

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:31.613 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AUGMENTATION.

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:33.582 region:rollup2
I WOULD BE MORE FUNDING FOR BOTH

01:27:31.613 --> 01:27:34.916 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTEEN

01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:37.219 region:rollup2
NINETEEN UNDER THE MY REVISION

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:38.687 region:rollup2
MORE FUNDING YASSER IT WOULD GO

01:27:37.219 --> 01:27:40.689 region:rollup2
UP UNDER THE MAYOR OF VISION

01:27:38.687 --> 01:27:42.257 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE MILLION AND SEVENTEEN

01:27:40.689 --> 01:27:43.825 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN. AND THEY ARE THE HOW

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:46.595 region:rollup2
TO PROPOSAL IT WOULD GO ON

01:27:43.825 --> 01:27:48.697 region:rollup2
TWENTY I AM FIVE MILLION IN

01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:50.632 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO FOUR

01:27:48.697 --> 01:27:52.400 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS MORE.

01:27:50.632 --> 01:27:53.235 region:rollup2
AND I'M GOING ON TWENTY FIVE W.

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.737 region:rollup2
SAID I'M SORRY.

01:27:53.235 --> 01:27:56.805 region:rollup2
YA SO THERE WOULD BE OTHER

01:27:55.737 --> 01:27:58.073 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IS RUNNING A

01:27:56.805 --> 01:27:59.541 region:rollup2
SHORTFALL SO THEY WOULD PROVIDE

01:27:58.073 --> 01:28:01.109 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY ONE MILLION TO BACK

01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:02.210 region:rollup2
FILL AND THEN TWENTY FIVE

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:03.879 region:rollup2
MILLION YES AND THE WAY YOU'RE

01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:04.479 region:rollup2
SCORING AT JUST THE DIFFERENCE

01:28:03.879 --> 01:28:06.681 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE TWENTY ONE AND THE

01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:08.116 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE. FOUR MILLION YEAR

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:10.085 region:rollup2
OVER YEAR YEAH PLAY YAHTZEE ALL

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:10.585 region:rollup2
THE TIME OUT AGAIN THAT REALLY

01:28:10.085 --> 01:28:10.752 region:rollup2
QUICK WITH THE NUMBERS.

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:11.453 region:rollup2
SO.

01:28:10.752 --> 01:28:15.457 region:rollup2
.

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:16.992 region:rollup2
IS THAT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS.

01:28:15.457 --> 01:28:19.561 region:rollup2
NO WE DON'T THINK IF YOU WANTED

01:28:16.992 --> 01:28:20.862 region:rollup2
TO FUND THE HIGHER MAXIMUM AWARD

01:28:19.561 --> 01:28:23.465 region:rollup2
NO I THINK WE'RE PRETTY

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:25.367 region:rollup2
CONFIDENT IT'LL FALL SHORT.

01:28:23.465 --> 01:28:26.368 region:rollup2
I I DEPARTMENT FINANCIERS SHIRTS

01:28:25.367 --> 01:28:27.702 region:rollup2
EARNED BECAUSE I KNOW THE

01:28:26.368 --> 01:28:29.437 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR IS A BIG SUPPORTER

01:28:27.702 --> 01:28:30.806 region:rollup2
DRIVERS GOAL SO. CHAIR SURELY

01:28:29.437 --> 01:28:32.307 region:rollup2
GAP THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO

01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:34.309 region:rollup2
THE WAY THAT WE CAME UP WITH

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:35.644 region:rollup2
THIS CALCULATION WAS OUT WE WORK

01:28:34.309 --> 01:28:36.645 region:rollup2
VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH THE

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:38.346 region:rollup2
SCHOOL FINANCE AUTHORITY WHO

01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:39.281 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERS THE PROGRAM. AND

01:28:38.346 --> 01:28:41.349 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE

01:28:39.281 --> 01:28:43.652 region:rollup2
DETERMINING HOW THE BEHAVIOR IS

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:44.486 region:rollup2
I'M ON THE CHARTER SCHOOLS AND

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:45.987 region:rollup2
HOW THEY'RE REACTING TO THIS NEW

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:46.888 region:rollup2
POLICY ITS WRITER SINK THE WAY

01:28:45.987 --> 01:28:49.891 region:rollup2
AT THE ALLEY O..

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:51.393 region:rollup2
CALCULATED THE POLICY IS IF.

01:28:49.891 --> 01:28:52.994 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY THEY IN HIS.

01:28:51.393 --> 01:28:54.896 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE EIGHTY A IN THE

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:56.565 region:rollup2
CURRENT PROGRAM TIMES THAT BY

01:28:54.896 --> 01:29:00.135 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST GRANT AMOUNT NOW WE

01:28:56.565 --> 01:29:00.902 region:rollup2
KNOW BASED ON PARTICIPATION THAT

01:29:00.135 --> 01:29:02.504 region:rollup2
ONLY ABOUT.

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:04.806 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT ACTUALLY GET

01:29:02.504 --> 01:29:06.474 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST GRANT AMOUNT SO IF

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:07.509 region:rollup2
WE WERE TO GO WITH THE ALLEY OF

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:08.877 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTY

01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:10.212 region:rollup2
TWO MILLION. THAT COULD POSSIBLY

01:29:08.877 --> 01:29:11.580 region:rollup2
BE OVER APPROPRIATING THE

01:29:10.212 --> 01:29:13.081 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND THEREFORE WE GET THE

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:15.183 region:rollup2
SAVINGS IN THE PROGRAM. MOVING

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:17.152 region:rollup2
FORWARD SO OUR APPROACH IS TO

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:18.854 region:rollup2
USE OUR OUR BEST ESTIMATES BASED

01:29:17.152 --> 01:29:20.388 region:rollup2
ON BEHAVIOR THAT WE'RE SEEING IN

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:22.057 region:rollup2
CURRENT YEAR THAT ADJUSTING TO

01:29:20.388 --> 01:29:23.658 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT ONTO THE NEW POLICY

01:29:22.057 --> 01:29:25.460 region:rollup2
AS THE BUDGET ACT. AND THEN

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:27.495 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD ADDICT USING NOT

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.964 region:rollup2
FUNDING AS A BASE AND THEN WITH

01:29:27.495 --> 01:29:30.031 region:rollup2
THE COLA. DRINK OUR DIFFERENCES

01:29:28.964 --> 01:29:31.633 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ARE ARE MUCH MORE

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:33.702 region:rollup2
STRAIGHT FORWARD I THINK THAT

01:29:31.633 --> 01:29:35.036 region:rollup2
THEY ASSUME NO ATTENDANCE GROWTH

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:36.371 region:rollup2
OR VERY LITTLE ATTENDANCE GROW

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:37.672 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE ONE PERCENT YEAR

01:29:36.371 --> 01:29:39.474 region:rollup2
OVER YEAR. WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:29:37.672 --> 01:29:41.276 region:rollup2
ACTUAL ATTENDANCE GROWTH CHARTER

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:42.510 region:rollup2
SCHOOL ADA SCORED IN THIS

01:29:41.276 --> 01:29:45.280 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS BEEN MORE LIKE

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:46.014 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PERCENT ON AVERAGE

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:47.382 region:rollup2
SO WE USE LIKE A THREE YEAR

01:29:46.014 --> 01:29:49.017 region:rollup2
ROLLING AVERAGE TO RUN OUR

01:29:47.382 --> 01:29:51.353 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AND

01:29:49.017 --> 01:29:53.121 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY HOLD IT FLAT.

01:29:51.353 --> 01:29:55.056 region:rollup2
BUT THIS NECESSARILY MEAN THAT

01:29:53.121 --> 01:29:56.658 region:rollup2
THE EIGHTY A IS WHAT DETERMINES

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:58.126 region:rollup2
THE GRANT AND NOW IT'S MORE

01:29:56.658 --> 01:30:00.061 region:rollup2
LIKELY THAT THE FACILITIES COSTS

01:29:58.126 --> 01:30:00.996 region:rollup2
AT LEAST COSTS. ARE WHAT

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:02.631 region:rollup2
DETERMINES THE GRANT AMOUNT THE

01:30:00.996 --> 01:30:06.001 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION THE PROGRAM.

01:30:02.631 --> 01:30:06.968 region:rollup2
HEAVILY IS FUNDED ON FACILITIES

01:30:06.001 --> 01:30:08.370 region:rollup2
AND LEASE COST RATHER THAN

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:10.605 region:rollup2
EIGHTY A SHARON THIS IS WAY TOO

01:30:08.370 --> 01:30:11.606 region:rollup2
TACKY BUT WE LOOK AT LEAST COST

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:12.874 region:rollup2
TO THESE ARE LIVE LIKE BEING

01:30:11.606 --> 01:30:14.809 region:rollup2
DRIVERS EIGHTY AND LEASE COSTS

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:16.011 region:rollup2
AND LEAST COSTS GO UP ON AVERAGE

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:17.812 region:rollup2
ABOUT SIX PERCENT A YEAR.

01:30:16.011 --> 01:30:19.314 region:rollup2
FINANCE HOUSING TAPPED TO THE

01:30:17.812 --> 01:30:21.383 region:rollup2
LEAST COST UNDER THEIR PROPOSAL

01:30:19.314 --> 01:30:22.751 region:rollup2
AT THE KEY TWELVE COLA AND WE

01:30:21.383 --> 01:30:23.885 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR THAT AS WELL. SO

01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:25.587 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ACCOUNT THAT LEASE

01:30:23.885 --> 01:30:26.721 region:rollup2
COSTS WILL NOT GROW AS MUCH AS

01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:28.223 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TRADITIONALLY BECAUSE

01:30:26.721 --> 01:30:29.324 region:rollup2
OF THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL

01:30:28.223 --> 01:30:32.827 region:rollup2
IT'LL BE CAPPED AT MORE LIKE

01:30:29.324 --> 01:30:33.295 region:rollup2
THREE RATHER THAN SIX PERCENT SO

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:34.963 region:rollup2
CAN THE BIG DRIVERS.

01:30:33.295 --> 01:30:36.164 region:rollup2
AND.

01:30:34.963 --> 01:30:37.332 region:rollup2
WELL I'M I'M WAITING TO HEAR

01:30:36.164 --> 01:30:38.633 region:rollup2
FROM THE CHARTER SCHOOL

01:30:37.332 --> 01:30:40.302 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY OUT THERE ON THIS

01:30:38.633 --> 01:30:42.270 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION OF WHAT SHOULD WE BE

01:30:40.302 --> 01:30:43.705 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THAT. HAVE MOUNTED

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:45.240 region:rollup2
STUDENTS GOING TO WE SHOULD BE

01:30:43.705 --> 01:30:47.409 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT. THE MEDIAN THE

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:49.110 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT WHICH THE DEPARTMENT

01:30:47.409 --> 01:30:50.745 region:rollup2
OF FINANCE AND IT'S BECAUSE OF

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:51.680 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WE QUESTION AND

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:53.882 region:rollup2
HISTORICAL LINES IN.

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:54.849 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT OVER FUNDED SO YOU

01:30:53.882 --> 01:30:56.618 region:rollup2
THINK YOU'RE FUNDING IT IS FULL

01:30:54.849 --> 01:30:57.752 region:rollup2
NAY. THE LA O. DISAGREES

01:30:56.618 --> 01:31:00.322 region:rollup2
SO.

01:30:57.752 --> 01:31:01.957 region:rollup2
I DON'T.

01:31:00.322 --> 01:31:02.590 region:rollup2
LATER ON IN THE TESTIMONY HOPE

01:31:01.957 --> 01:31:03.458 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE SOME DETAILS WHAT THEY

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:04.292 region:rollup2
THINK.

AS YOU SAID EARLIER YOU KNOW

01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:30.585 region:rollup2
THIS IS OUR IDEA TO MARINATE

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:31.186 region:rollup2
THESE IDEAS PROPOSALS AND COME

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:31.553 region:rollup2

WHAT NUMBER?

01:38:43.518 --> 01:38:48.322 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE.

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:49.757 region:rollup2

AND WE OFTEN SAY THAT THAT.

01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:59.267 region:rollup2
BUDGETS ARE A REFLECTION OF OF

01:38:57.098 --> 01:39:00.902 region:rollup2
VALUES

01:38:59.267 --> 01:39:02.370 region:rollup2
AND THIS WILL OPEN AGAIN WHEN

01:39:00.902 --> 01:39:03.137 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NO MONEY WE'RE CUTTING

01:39:02.370 --> 01:39:05.139 region:rollup2

COST OF LIVING WHAT CONTINUES TO

01:39:19.353 --> 01:39:21.222 region:rollup2
RISE.

01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:22.857 region:rollup2

DOUBLE DOWN.

01:40:38.165 --> 01:40:42.069 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR MY QUESTION TO YOU IS

01:40:40.268 --> 01:40:43.671 region:rollup2
THAT I KNOW I HAVE NINE YEAR

01:40:42.069 --> 01:40:44.906 region:rollup2
OLDS AND THERE MIGHT BE THESE

01:40:43.671 --> 01:40:45.806 region:rollup2

OR TEN ON YOUR SEIZE YOUR BABY

01:40:45.806 --> 01:40:49.677 region:rollup2
TOO. SO WHAT WE CONSIDER BABIES

01:40:48.276 --> 01:40:50.945 region:rollup2
ARE RECONSIDERING UP TO ZERO

01:40:49.677 --> 01:40:52.246 region:rollup2
THROUGH FIVE ARE WE ARE WE

01:40:50.945 --> 01:40:53.981 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT JUST INCIDENT TALLER

01:40:52.246 --> 01:40:54.548 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WORD AT THE COMMITTEE

01:40:53.981 --> 01:40:56.384 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT ALL THOSE ISSUES

01:40:54.548 --> 01:40:58.719 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:40:56.384 --> 01:41:00.087 region:rollup2
FROM FROM EARLY EDUCATION

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:01.989 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR STATE A PREPAID

01:41:00.087 --> 01:41:03.391 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AS WELL AS IMPOTENT

01:41:01.989 --> 01:41:04.992 region:rollup2
TALLER ACCESS AND STATE

01:41:03.391 --> 01:41:06.060 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE PROGRAM WE PRIMARILY

01:41:04.992 --> 01:41:07.595 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THIS IS FROM

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:08.996 region:rollup2
ZERO TO THREE YEARS OLD. I MEAN

01:41:07.595 --> 01:41:10.698 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY GOES LONGER THAN THAT

01:41:08.996 --> 01:41:12.099 region:rollup2
BUT THE ISSUE IS THAT MANY OF

01:41:10.698 --> 01:41:13.100 region:rollup2
OUR INFANTS WE DON'T HAVE A

01:41:12.099 --> 01:41:14.835 region:rollup2
PLACE TO TAKE THEM MANY

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:16.203 region:rollup2
PRESCHOOLS WILL NOT TAKE A CHILD

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:17.972 region:rollup2
THAT HAS NOT BEEN POTTY TRAINED.

01:41:16.203 --> 01:41:19.740 region:rollup2
AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE

01:41:17.972 --> 01:41:21.976 region:rollup2
GET THOSE CHILDREN IN A REALLY

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:24.011 region:rollup2
RELIABLE. OF SETTING AND.

01:41:21.976 --> 01:41:25.479 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL

01:41:24.011 --> 01:41:27.882 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY DO THAT.

01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:28.749 region:rollup2
I KNOW I'M A GRANDMOTHER AND MY

01:41:27.882 --> 01:41:30.685 region:rollup2
DAUGHTER CAN'T FIND A CURE.

01:41:28.749 --> 01:41:33.321 region:rollup2
SHE LIVES IN LOS ANGELES.

01:41:30.685 --> 01:41:34.021 region:rollup2
CALLS ME IN TEARS AND TO SIGN UP

01:41:33.321 --> 01:41:36.724 region:rollup2
FOR DAYCARE IT'S.

01:41:34.021 --> 01:41:38.459 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS HER

01:41:36.724 --> 01:41:39.627 region:rollup2
REGISTRATION AND AFTER SHE'S

01:41:38.459 --> 01:41:41.295 region:rollup2
FILLED OUT THE FORM THEY SAY WE

01:41:39.627 --> 01:41:42.563 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ANY OPENINGS.

01:41:41.295 --> 01:41:44.065 region:rollup2
SO IT'S BECOME VERY VERY

01:41:42.563 --> 01:41:45.666 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT AND SO MANY OF OUR

01:41:44.065 --> 01:41:47.335 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO FIND ANY KIND OF

01:41:45.666 --> 01:41:47.902 region:rollup2
DAYCARE. AND I THINK THAT WE

01:41:47.335 --> 01:41:49.704 region:rollup2
SHOULD.

01:41:47.902 --> 01:41:52.173 region:rollup2
NOT PREVENT A FAMILY FROM BEING

01:41:49.704 --> 01:41:53.641 region:rollup2
WHOLE AND MAKING SURE WE GET

01:41:52.173 --> 01:41:55.610 region:rollup2
THESE KIDS IN A RELIABLE CALLED.

01:41:53.641 --> 01:41:57.511 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:41:55.610 --> 01:41:59.614 region:rollup2
SETTING SURE SO THAT YES THIS IS

01:41:57.511 --> 01:42:01.349 region:rollup2
FOR THE. FOR FOR PROBE BEFORE

01:41:59.614 --> 01:42:02.984 region:rollup2
THEY START SCHOOL BASICALLY AND

01:42:01.349 --> 01:42:04.151 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S ALSO OF COURSE ASKS

01:42:02.984 --> 01:42:05.286 region:rollup2
FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND

01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:06.554 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:42:05.286 --> 01:42:08.089 region:rollup2
WE'RE GETTING THERE AND AND ONE

01:42:06.554 --> 01:42:10.524 region:rollup2
THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO ON TO

01:42:08.089 --> 01:42:11.626 region:rollup2
LOOK AT TO. IS THAT YOU KNOW

01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:13.494 region:rollup2
THIS OF COURSE IS JUST FOR

01:42:11.626 --> 01:42:14.895 region:rollup2

01:43:11.786 --> 01:43:15.289 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE THAT WE HEARD A FEW

01:43:13.354 --> 01:43:16.123 region:rollup2
MINUTES AGO BETWEEN THE LA WHEN

01:43:15.289 --> 01:43:17.658 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:43:16.123 --> 01:43:20.227 region:rollup2
FINANCE I THINK EXEMPLIFIES THE

01:43:17.658 --> 01:43:21.395 region:rollup2
FACT THAT. THE TIMING OF THIS.

01:43:20.227 --> 01:43:24.231 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:43:21.395 --> 01:43:25.933 region:rollup2
IS SUCH THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS

KNOW EXACTLY THE NUMBERS IN THE

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:29.370 region:rollup2
BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR.

01:43:28.069 --> 01:43:31.539 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:34.108 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS TO TRUE UP IN MAY.

01:43:31.539 --> 01:43:35.209 region:rollup2
WHAT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS ARE THE

01:43:34.108 --> 01:43:36.644 region:rollup2

TREASURER'S OFFICE SPEND A

01:43:36.644 --> 01:43:39.980 region:rollup2
GREAT DEAL OF TIME TRYING TO

01:43:38.412 --> 01:43:42.550 region:rollup2
KIND OF FIGURE OUT THE NUMBERS.

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:43.818 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD AND WE VERY MUCH

01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:45.886 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT WE THINK THIS

01:43:43.818 --> 01:43:47.588 region:rollup2
IDEA OF CHEWING UP EVERY MAY IS

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:48.722 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE RIGHT WAY TO GO SO

01:43:47.588 --> 01:43:49.590 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY DO GET THE RIGHT

01:43:48.722 --> 01:43:52.259 region:rollup2

THEY MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS ABOUT

01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:58.632 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THE TRAILER BILL

01:43:57.398 --> 01:43:59.767 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE SHOULD TO PROVIDE A

01:43:58.632 --> 01:44:01.635 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY TO THE

01:43:59.767 --> 01:44:03.637 region:rollup2

IN THAT ONE I WAS EXPECTED AND

01:44:04.972 --> 01:44:07.441 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD PROPOSAL

01:44:06.373 --> 01:44:11.145 region:rollup2

EXPANSION OF SLOTS BUT
