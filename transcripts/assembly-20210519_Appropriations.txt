MR BURNER HARBATH HERE I CAN'T SEE- IN THAT CASE MISS BALCONY IN YOUR NEXT. AB. NINE EIGHTY EIGHT- THIS IS- I SEE YOUR TESTIFYING ON A BILL THAT IS BEING MOVED TO SUSPENSE. I DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A NUMBER FOR IT. NINE EIGHTY EIGHT IT IS AB NINETY I'M SORRY IT'S AB NINE EIGHT EIGHT THAT WE REST MAYBE NINETY IMPROVE. ALL RIGHT THIS THIS BILL IS- MOVING TO THE SUSPENSE COUNTER SO THERE'S NO MOTION NECESSARY. YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ENGAGEMENT ON THE BILL. THE FEDERALLY MANDATED NINE EIGHTY IS COMING TO CALIFORNIA IN JULY OF TWENTY TWO A DEDICATED PHONE LINE FOR MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IS OVERDUE IN CRITICAL BUT THE TIMELINE SET BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALSO MAKES IT IMPERATIVE THAT WE PASSED THE BILL. SO THAT WE HAVE THE FUNDS AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THE ANTICIPATED 30% INCREASE IN CALL VOLUME AND CALIFORNIA'S EMERGENCY MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM. THEN I NEED A USER FEE IS CRITICAL TO FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A WORKING A COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS SYSTEM. HOWEVER I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE NINETY DAY USER FEE REVENUE WILL BE USED TO SUPPLEMENT AND NOT SUPPLANT. CURRENT MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING. I'VE BEEN ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS% THROUGHOUT THE STATE ON HOW TO STRUCTURE THE NINE EIGHT USER FEE. TO ENSURE THAT IT FUNDS CRITICAL ELEMENTS OF THE NINE EIGHT EIGHT SYSTEM. BUT IS BALANCED THROUGH APPROPRIATE CHECKS TO THAT END WE'VE AMENDED THE BILL TWO OUT TO CAP AT THE SAME LEVEL OF THE NINE ONE ONE SURCHARGE EIGHTY CENTS. AND FURTHER SPECIFIED THAT THE NINETY USER FEE WILL BE SAID AT THE SAME RATE AS NINE ONE ONE. FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS THEREFORE IT AND THEIR AFTER IT WILL BE A RATE SET BY- YES BASED ON ACTUAL COST APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. WE ADDED A STRONG STATE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS REQUIRING COUNTIES AND CALL CENTERS REPORT ON THEIR EXPENDITURES. THIS AMENDMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EXISTING LANGUAGE REQUIRING THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROVE THE ANNUAL RATE WILL ENSURE THE NINETY THAT USER FEE IS NOT A BLANK CHECK. WE HAVE TIED THE PERMITTED EXPENDITURES TO THE FEDERAL AUTHORIZING STATUTE WHICH WILL ENSURE THE REVENUE IS ONLY SPENT ON I NEED A CALL CENTERS. AND THE SERVICES THAT ARE A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE NINETY DAY CALLS. WE'VE ADDED PRIORITIZATION. WERE REVENUE WILL FIRST AND FOREMOST FUND THE NINETY DAY CALL CENTERS. FOLLOWED BY MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS FOLLOWED BY ANY OTHER ELIGIBLE EXPENDITURES UNDER FEDERAL LAW. WE'VE ALSO MADE A TECHNICAL CHANGE TO ENSURE THAT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT PAYING THIS USER FEE. I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT WE TOOK MANY OF CABLES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS INCLUDING ADDING THE KEY CAP ADDING LIMITED LIABILITY PROVISIONS FOR SERVICE CARRIERS. AND REMOVING THE EXEMPTION FOR PREPAID LINES. I WANT TO KNOW THAT WE DO ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS IN THE SYSTEM FROM THE PROGRAM WHERE PROGRAM SIMILAR TO NINETY EIGHT ALREADY EXISTS THE COST SAVINGS HAVE BEEN IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS. SAVINGS FROM REDUCTIONS IN AMBULANCE RIDES EMERGENCY ROOM TREATMENT AND TO DECREASE AND POLICE RESPONSE TO MENTAL HEALTH CALLS. JUST ONE EXAMPLE IN EUGENE OREGON WHICH OBVIOUSLY PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY SPENT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON THEIR COMPUTER PROGRAM BUT SAVED FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE YEAR THAT'S A RETURN ON INVESTMENT OF SEVEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR SPENT. HERE TODAY TO SPEAK ON THE BILL IS ANGELA CAMPBELL FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM MENTAL ILLNESS AND TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS. IS TARA CAN BOECE MEN FROM THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE. THANK YOU WILL GO TO YOUR- YOUR WITNESSES ON THE PHONE AND THEY GET TWO MINUTES TO TALK WITH FISCAL IMPACT OF THE BILL WE'LL START WITH ANGELA.

YOUR CONGRESS PASSED THE NATIONAL SUICIDE HOTLINE DESIGNATION ACTIVE TWENTY TWENTY WHICH DESIGNATED NINETY DAY IF THE NATION WIDE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUICIDE CRISIS LINE. CONGRESS RECOGNIZED THAT THE NUMBER IS NOT ENOUGH. AND EXPLICITLY DESIGNED THE STATE NINETY EIGHT USER FEES TO PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT THE COURT THE NINE MEETING SYSTEM IS ALWAYS PROTECTED. FROM GOING TO CREATE A TRUE ALTERNATIVE TO NINE ONE ONE. IF WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE MOST CRITICAL PIECES OF THE NINETY TRUMP. ARE FUNDED. IN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE ALLOW US TO LINK ARGUMENT THINKING REGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM AND LEVERAGE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL INVESTMENT.

WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WITH THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I SEE DOCTOR COURT HAS A QUESTION. YES MADAM ASSEMBLY MEMBER- I'M- JUST NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING IT SAYS WELL THE FIRST TWO YEARS IT'S THE SAME AS THE NINE ONE ONE FEE. WHICH ALSO SHOULD GIVE YOU A BALANCE BECAUSE THE COSTS. ARE GOING TO BE LESS THAN- THAT IS COLLECTED BY THE NINE ONE ONE FEE. AND THEN AFTER THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE NINE ONE ONE APPROACH. TO CALCULATE THE COSTS- I'M- AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THAT WORKS BECAUSE FOR NINE ONE ONE YOU'RE JUST LOOKING AT THE CALL CENTERS. BUT HERE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE CALL CENTERS PLUS- SOME O THE DUTIES CARRIED OUT AS A RESULT OF CALLS THAT COME IN- SO HOW CAN YOU BE USING THE SAME APPROACHES NINE ONE ONE. WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT MORE COSTS THAN THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CARTER QUESTION- FIRST I'LL NOTE THAT THAT THE AMENDMENT THAT WE TAKE IN THIS COMMITTEE AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF- THE COMMITTEE WAS TO BACK. TO SET THAT FEE FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS SO THAT WE HAVE CERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THOSE SET UP COSTS WILL BE AND IT WILL START ABOUT SIX AS I MENTIONED THE PHONE WILL START RINGING CALIFORNIA JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO NO MATTER WHAT WE DO. AND SO AND WE ARE- WE ARE- WE ARE SETTING THOSE FEES AND MAKING SURE THAT WORK WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT IS BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ONLY CHARGING ACTUAL COST SO- YES WILL BE CHARGED WITH FIGURE OUT ACTUAL CLASSES COMING TO LEGISLATURE IN GETTING THE APPROVAL OF THE I'M- OF THE LEGISLATURE ON NOT FEE. ALTHOUGH WE'RE OPEN TO. YOU KNOW HOW WE DO THIS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE SURE THERE'S CLARITY AND STRONG GUARDRAILS WHICH AS I MENTIONED THE BEGINNING OR MANY OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN CURRENTLY- SO. I AM NOT. I WANT TO BE CLEAR DR COURT BEFORE THIS EXCHANGE CONTINUES BECAUSE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE CONFUSED THERE ARE NO AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN THIS BILL IS ON SUSPENSE. IT WILL EITHER LEAVE SUSPENSE WITH AUTHORS AMENDMENTS OR COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS BUT NOTHING AT THIS POINT YOU CAN'T TAKE AMENDMENTS. WILD BILL IS ON SUSPENSE SO. THERE WAS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN PROBABLY THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE MEMBER STAFF ABOUT POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS HAVE ONE BE VERY CLEAR. THIS BILL HAS NOT YET BEEN AMENDED IF IT WILL BE AMENDED ILL BE AMENDED. IF IT SHOULD COME OFF OF SUSPENSE IN IT COULD BE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AMENDMENT YES AND I APOLOGIZE I SHOULD SAY THAT WE TOOK AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. AND THEY WENT IN THROUGH COUNCIL THAT ARE IN PRINCE I SHOULD SAY- AGAIN DO THAT BACK AND FORTH THAT ARE NOT BEING DONE. BY THE KICK I GUESS THAT WAS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS I SHOULD CLEAR. POLITICS FOR BETTER STAY THERE IN THIS COMMITTEE THEIR REQUESTED AUTHORS AMENDMENTS THEY ARE NOT AUTHORS AMENDMENTS UNTIL WE ACTUALLY APPROVE THOSE AMENDMENTS AND THEY GET MOVED TO THE FLOOR. YEAH THANK YOU I'M SO I'M SORRY IT'S JUST PERCENT ALL AND I DON'T WANT EVERYBODY RUNNING TO ME WITH WONDER. WHY I WANT AMEND THEIR BILL AND SUSPENSE I APOLOGIZE AND I'M SORRY I MISSPOKE MANAGER. IT'S OKAY. IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE NINE ONE ONE FEE BECAUSE YOU'RE- YOU'RE DOING BOTH CALL CENTERS AND THE WORK SO I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN SAY IT'S BASED ON THE NINE ONE ONE THREE- I'M SORRY IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. THAT'S FINE SO IT DOES COVER A DIFFERENT SCOPE OF THINGS WHICH I THINK IS WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT IS THAT RIGHT YES SO AND THAT WILL BE BUT- YES HAS THE AUTHORITY SO COUPLE THINGS IMPORTANT THAT IS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE REIMBURSING 85% OF THE COST OF THE MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE TEAM. THERE FEDERAL LEGISLATION SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE COSTS WILL KNOCK HIM DOWN TO THE STATE THE FIA COUNTIES- BUT WE WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF. PERCENT OF CALLS WE EXPECT TO HAVE THOSE RESPONSE TEAMS THE COST OF THOSE RESPONSE TEAMS WHAT THE REMAINING 15% IS AND WORK THAT INTO THE ESTIMATE THAT WILL COME TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR APPROVAL IF I MAKE SENSE. OKAY COME CLOSE ENOUGH THANKS. VERY MISTER KIRK MADE IN UNDERSTAND. CLOSE THANK YOU AND I APOLOGIZE AGAIN FOR THE LACK OF CLARITY ON MY PART MADAM CHAIR. AND BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT THIS BILL BE MOVED OFF SUSPEND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE WILL MOVE ON TO- MISS BERNARD HORNBACH. MISTER. HORVATH HAS. ANNOUNCEMENTS ON SCHOOL AND- STATE LANDS ARE LANDS GRANTED FOR A TO THE STATE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO GENERATE REVENUES FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. UNDER THE SCHOOL AND BREAK ACT THE COMMISSION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING ALL ACTIONS NECESSARY. TO DEVELOP SCHOOL LANDS INTO PERMANENT A PRODUCTIVE REVENUE SOURCES. THE SCHOOL LANDS ARE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE BECAUSE THEY'RE BROKEN UP INTO NONCONTIGUOUS SQUARE MILE PARCELS THE LEGISLATURE FROM THE CONSULTING THE SCHOOL IMPARTIAL CENTER CONTIGUOUS HOLDINGS IS ESSENTIAL. TO SOUND AND EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT AS SUCH EXISTING LAW AUTHORIZES THE COMMISSION TO SELL ISOLATED NON ECONOMIC SCHOOL LANDS. AND USE THE FUNDS FOR THE SALES TO PURCHASE REAL PROPERTY THAT WILL GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUES. THE PROBLEM UNDER EXISTING LAW IS THAT THE COMMISSION IS CONSTRAINED BY THE EXISTING 5% CAP FOR THE USE OF FUNDS TO PAY ANCILLARY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LAND PERSON PURCHASES. AND THE EXISTING CAP UNDERMINES THE COMMISSION'S COMPETITIVENESS IN THE MARKET BECAUSE IT MUST RELY ON SELLERS TO VOLUNTEER MOMENTARILY. TO PAY THE COSTS THAT EXCEED THE MAY BE WILLING TO PAY ALL COSTS. IN ADDITION IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THIRD PARTY COSTS ARE FOR SPECIFIC SEAL AND THE COMMISSION CANNOT. MAKE A DOWN PAYMENT ON LAND PURCHASED ON A TIMELY FASHION BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO. AB THIRTEEN NINETY CLARIFIES THE COMMISSION CAMPAIGN BETWEEN LAND ACQUISITION COSTS. AND REMOVES THE 5% CAP ON THESE EXPENSES. THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES THAT THE COMMISSION MORE FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT SELLS OR CONVEYS LANDS IN A MANNER THAT RESULTS IN RETURNING ANCESTRAL LANDS. TO NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES. THE BILL WOULD ALSO BETTER POSITION THE COMMISSION TO AVAIL ITSELF OF OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO FACILITATE RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS WHICH WOULD HELP TRANSITION CALIFORNIA TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE AND HELP CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE AND FEDERAL THIRTY BY THIRTY WHAT. POLICIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY SHERI PEMBERTON CHIEF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS LEGISLATIVE LIAISON FOR THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL.

MODIFIES THE STATE BROADBAND PERMITTING PROCESS TO ENSURE LINES WITH UPDATED FEDERAL RULES. IT ALSO PROVIDES CLARITY AROUND THE STARTING POINT FOR THE SHOT CLOCK AS WELL AS CLARITY FOR THE EXISTING GAVE TO PROVE PROCESS AT THE CONCLUSION THE START AT THE SHOT CLOCK. AS THE ANALYSIS ARE HIGHLIGHTS THIS BILL DOES NOT HAVE STATE CROSS BECAUSE LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO LEVEL FEES AND CHARGES TO COVER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BILL- THE- IN THE FUTURE WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD WITH THE OPPOSITION TO COME UP WITH LANGUAGE WE CAN ALL AGREE ON I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO GO IN THE SAME DIRECTION- BUT IT'S IN THE HANDS OF THE LAWYERS- HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. OF AB FIVE THREE SEVEN THIS NAY TO SELL OFF. ON BEHALF OF CROWN CASTLE WILL SPEAK BRIEFLY ON THE- OF FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES- THE DANCE RIGHT SIR. MAKES ALL OF ON BEHALF OF DAN SCHNEIDER IN THE CROWN CASTLE SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL WE AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEES FISCAL ANALYSIS THIS BILL WILL NOT CUT THE STATE ANY MONEY SINCE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN CHARGE FEES TO COVER PERMITTING COSTS. THE BILL WILL ALLOW HIGH SPEED INTERNET PROJECTS TO BE BUILT IN MONTHS INSTEAD OF YEARS. AND THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS- BUT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO RETAIN LOCAL CONTROL COULD SIMPLY ALLOW THEM TO APPROVE OR DENY PERMITS IT JUST MANDATES THAT THEY DO IT AND THE FEDERALLY MANDATED TIMELINES WHEN YOU RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

SHOT CLOCKS PROMOTE AND COMPOSED DEEMED APPROVAL STANDARDS WHICH THE FCC REFUSED TO ADOPT AND THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS REFUSED TO GRANT IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. BEYOND HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS BUT WE FOCUS ON THE FISCAL IMPACT OF ALL FOLLOWED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FIFTIES RICHARD HEARD ABOUT ARE LIMITED BY LAW. THEY PROTECT THE COST PER TEAM TO THE LITIGATION LIABILITY COSTS FIRST OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FAILED TO MEET TO SHORTEN DEEMED APPROVAL SHOT CLOCK. THIS BILL REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PAY FOR THE COURT CHALLENGES TO TELECOM APPLICANTS INSTEAD OF THE OTHER WAY AROUND THIS IS THE OPPOSITION. THE OPPOSITE POSITION AT THE FCC RULES AND RECOMMENDATIONS THIS TRANSFER OF LITIGATION COSTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALMOST CERTAINLY BE. A FINANCIAL BURDEN THERE'S ALSO THE LACK OF LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR WIRELESS BROADBAND PROVIDERS WHICH TRANSFERS CONSUL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND COMMUNITIES. THE TELECOM RELATED MALIBU FIRE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN COST SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND BURNED OVER A THOUSAND ACRES COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT FIRE NOT INCLUDING THE HEALTH COSTS WERE BORNE BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND ARE IN PART BY CITIES LIKE MALIBU AND MANY OTHERS ACROSS THE STATE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL.
