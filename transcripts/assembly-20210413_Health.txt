THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TO COPE WITH NINETEEN CANDAMAGE HAS MADE A COOLEY CLEAR THAT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA MUST HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE INCLUDING UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS. WE HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE ARE EXCLUDED FROM MEDICAL SERVICES COBIT NINETEEN HAS IMMERSED MERCILESSLY HIT OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WORK IN OUR FIELDS AND OTHER ESSENTIAL JOBS TO KEEP OUR ECONOMY AND OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM GOING DURING THIS CRISIS. WE KNOW THAT THOSE WHO LACK INSURANCE GET SICKER AND DIE SOONER WE NOTE THAT THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF THE UNINSURED IS OUR UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY. I WAS ON THE FRONT LINESOF HEALTH CARE AND FEEL THE URGENCY TO FIX THIS CURRENT HEALTHCARE CRISIS INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE CARE IN A TIMELY MANNER TO PREVENT ILLNESS FROM DETERIORATING MANY UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ONLY ACCESS HEALTH CARE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. WHERE MANY TIMES PHYSICIANS LIKE MYSELF ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO HELP DUE TO THE EXACERBATIONS. OF THEIR ILLNESS. I HAVE SEEN CAN CASE WHO HAVE COME IN MY MERGING ROOM IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN OUR COUNTRY'S BREADBASKET WHERE THE FARMWORKERS WHO HELPED TO PRODUCE THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WHICH BILL OUR TABLES AND FEED OUR FAMILIES. ARE UNABLE TO DO THE SAME FOR THEIR OWN FAMILIES DUE TO THEIR DIRE HEALTH CIRCUMSTANCES. NOT ONLY IS THIS CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS DETRIMENTAL TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS BUT IT ALSO INCREASES THE DEMAND ON EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES AND INCREASES COSTS IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OVERALL. IN A MANNER THAT COULD BE PREVENTED. CALIFORNIA HAS A LEGACY OF EXPANDING HEALTH CARE TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND AB FOUR WILL CONTINUE IN THIS VEIN. I AM CONFIDENT THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP US MEET OUR GOAL TO EXPAND FULL SCOPE MEDICAL TO ALL CALIFORNIANS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BY REMOVING IMMIGRATION STATUS AS AN ELIGIBILITY BARRIER TO MEDIC. CALIFORNIA CAN BUILD A MORE UNIVERSAL. EQUITABLE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR ALL WHO CALL THIS STATE HOME.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND AS SUCH I HOPE WE RECOGNIZE THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE TREATED WITH THE SAME DIGNITY AND GIVEN THIS RIGHT WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE ON TO NEXT BILL. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BEFORE I BEGIN I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS TO CAP THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES TO BE LICENSED PURSUANT TO THIS BILL AT FIFTY AND TO PROVIDE A TEN YEAR SUNSET. MEMBERS AB THREE SEVENTY EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE BY ALLOWING MEDICARE CERTIFIED AMBULATORY SURGICAL CENTERS ASC'S TO PERFORM ELECTIVE PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION PCI PROCEDURES SUCH AS ANGIOPLASTY SINCE STENTING AND CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION PROCEDURES. EXPANDING THESE SPECIFIC CARDIAC PROCEDURES AND ASC'S WILL REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS OVERALL WITHOUT COMPROMISING PATIENT SAFETY. ASC'S HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMING THESE PROCEDURES AND WELL OVER HALF THE COUNTRY FOR YEARS SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PCI PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED IN THEIR CITIES WITH A COMPLICATION RATE WELL UNDER 1% HOWEVER BECAUSE OF AN OUTDATED STATUTE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ONLY ELEVEN STATES THAT EXPLICITLY AND LIMIT THE SITE OF SERVICE WHERE THESE CARDIOLOGY PROCEDURES CAN BE PERFORMED. CALIFORNIANS RESTRICTION ON SUCH PROCEDURES IS OUT OF STEP WITH OTHER STATES AND IS OUTDATED. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES RECOGNIZE THE BENEFITS OF PERFORMING SEVERAL LOW RISK CARDIAC PROCEDURES SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY IN AN ASC SETTING. AB THREE SEVENTY WILL AUTHORIZE MEDICARE CERTIFIED AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA TO PERFORM ELECTIVE CARDIOLOGY PROCEDURES. WITHOUT THE STATUTORY UPDATE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND PATIENTS ENROLLED IN COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE ARE NOT ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INCREASED ACCESS TO CARE OPTIONS AND THE SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS QUALITY OF CARE AND CONVENIENCE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE TO THEM. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS STRAINED THE ENTIRE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND IS EXACERBATED MANY ISSUES AROUND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT WERE ALREADY PRESENT. AB THREE SEVENTY PROVIDES ANOTHER OPTION FOR LOW RISK PATIENTS TO RECEIVE CARE AB THREE SEVENTY PRIORITIZES HEALTH CARE ACCESS AFFORDABILITY AND PATIENT SAFETY THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE GREATER ACCESS TO THE SPECIFIED ELECTIVE CARDIAC PROCEDURES WHILE REDUCING OVERALL HEALTH CARE COSTS AND DEMAND ON SERVICES. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE STAFF FOR PROPOSING THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL WHICH WILL FURTHER ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY BY REQUIRING THAT AGENCIES COMPLY WITH THE SKY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE. MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THESE AMENDMENTS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND SPONSORS TO PROTECT PATIENTS AND EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE SEVENTY OUR PRICE DOUGHERTY FROM THE CALIFORNIA AMPLE OF AMBULATORY SURGERY ASSOCIATION AND DR KYLE MCCARTY LIST WITH THE SACRAMENTO HEART AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTER.

DR ARABIA MENTIONED THIS BILL ALLOWS AN AFC CERTIFIED BY CMS TO PERFORM DIAGNOSTIC INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY PROCEDURES SUCH AS DYE INJECTIONS TO DETECT ARCHER OF BLOCKAGES AT THEIR PEAK INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS ANGIOPLASTY AND STENTING UPON APPROVAL.

FURTHERMORE THE VACANCIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPORT QUALITY OUTCOMES TO THE NATIONAL CARDIOVASCULAR REGISTRIES AND USING THE DATA ACQUIRED FROM THESE NATIONAL REGISTRIES. THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT BUT EIGHTY ONLY DEVELOP AND MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC REPORTS REGARDING EACH CERTIFIED ANTES PERFORMANCE RATE OF MORTALITY AND STROKE. FURTHER TRANSPARENCY REQUIRES ANY POSITION WITHIN EQUITY INTEREST IN ONE OF THESE NANCY'S TO DISCLOSE TO THE PATIENT IN WRITING HAT FINAL FINANCIAL INTEREST BURKE OWNERSHIP IN THAT THEY ACTUALLY. THESE PROCEDURES ARE PREVENTED IN THE NATURE LOW RISK LIFESAVING AND ALREADY BEING DONE IN A ISSUES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AFC'S ARE ROUTINELY AND SAFELY PERFORMING PROCEDURES SUCH AS TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT TOTAL JOINT REPLACEMENT AND SPINE SURGERY. CALIFORNIA AGENCIES PROVIDE THESE SERVICES AT A MUCH LOWER COST TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE. IN PATIENTS STARTS OF SERVICE. APPLE ARE ON YOU SEE BURKE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT EVERY. BEING IN A- SAVE THE MEDICARE FORTY PER. AND SAFETY BENEFICIARIES 56% AND THEIR COPAYMENTS. RICKLY CMS PAGE TWENTY MILLION COST SAVINGS FROM THE MEDICARE PROGRAM FIVE MILLION AND PATIENT CO PAY COST SAVINGS IF JUST 5% OF THESE CARDIOLOGY PROCEDURES SHIFT TODAY A FEW STATIC. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB THREE SEVENTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS DOCTOR CARL MAKAYLA. I'M A BOARD CERTIFIED CARDIOLOGISTS PROVIDING CARE TO PATIENTS THAT ARE SACRAMENTO HEART AMATORY SURGERY CENTER. OUR DISEASE REMAINS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE NATION MANY OF THESE DEATHS CAN BE PREVENTED PATIENTS ARE GIVEN MORE OPTIONS TO SEE DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS FOR LOW RISK CARDIAC PROCEDURES IN THE ASC SETTING.

THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY HAS PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE EMS SYSTEM REGULATIONS. THAT ATTEMPT TO PRECLUDE ANY LOCAL EMS AGENCY FROM UTILIZING A SUBCONTRACTOR MODEL SIMILAR TO THE FIRE EMS ALLIANCE. WHICH WILL WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY RESTRICT A COUNTIES ABILITY TO PROVIDE EFFICIENT AND QUALITY CARE TO ITS RESIDENTS. AB THREE EIGHTY NINE WILL GUARANTEE THAT COUNTIES RETAIN THEIR ABILITY TO CONTRACT FOR EMERGENCY PROTECTION DISTRICT AND TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES THROUGH A SUBCONTRACT WITH A PRIVATE AMBULANCE SERVICE. THIS WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT THIS PROVEN EFFECTIVE SUBCONTRACTING MODEL FOR EMERGENCY EVERYONE'S DEPLOYMENT SYSTEMS WERE CONTINUE TO BE A OPTION.

THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THE SUPPORT. OF EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY NINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. IT IS MY PLEASURE TO REPRESENT THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT AND MORE IMPORTANTLY OUR EMERGENCY AMBULANCE OPERATIONS THE ALLIANCE JUST TWENTY SIXTEEN THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE AND OPERATIONALLY EFFICIENT AMBULANCE SUBCONTRACTING MODEL. IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY DISCONCERTED OVER ONE MILLION RESIDENTS THIS MODEL A FIRST OF ITS KIND IN CALIFORNIA HAS PROVEN THAT THE COMBINED PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE IN SERVICE OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS WHEN BROUGHT TOGETHER UNDER ONE SYSTEM BRINGS A HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICE AND FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY. AND ONE FIRE AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES DURING THE PUBLIC IN THEIR SEPARATE SILENCE. EIGHT THREE EIGHTY NINE IS NOW. TO SECURE THE FUTURE SUBCONTRACTING NOT ONLY CONTRA COSTA COUNTY BUT AS AN OPTION FOR OTHER COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN THE DELIVERY OF THEIR EMERGENCY AMBULANCE SERVICES. WITH A MODEL THAT HAS PROVEN ITS VALUE AND ABILITY TO IMPROVE RESPONSE TIMES INCREASED DEPLOYMENT OF AMBULANCE RESOURCES INCREASE CAPITAL INVESTMENT INTO THE MS SYSTEM. PARTICIPATE IN INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS TO SHAPE THE FUTURE OF EMS DELIVERY. AND CONSISTENTLY EXCEED COMPLIANCE WITH CONTRACTUAL RESPONSE TIME PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR OVER FIVE STRAIGHT YEARS THERE SHOULD BE LITTLE DOUBT THE SUBCONTRACTING SHOULD BE SUSTAINED AS A MODEL FOR OUR COUNTY. AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHER COUNTIES AFFECTED TO THEIR NEEDS. SUBCONTRACTING BEEN. IT IS NO AN EXPERIMENT. RESPONSE TIMES ARE REDUCED THROUGH INCREASED DEPLOYMENT OF AMBULANCES COUPLED WITH REDUCED NINE ONE ONE CALL PROCESSING TIMES WHEN THE FIRE AND EMS DISPATCH SYSTEMS ARE COMBINED. COMMUNICATION AND WORKING RELATIONSHIPS AMONGST THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR FIRST RESPONDERS IMPROVED CLINICAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SYSTEMS CAN BE JOINED STRENGTHENED. REDUCE REDUNDANCY IN RESPONSES BETWEEN FIRE AND EMS RESOURCES CAN BE ACHIEVED INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL AND THE ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INNOVATIVE DELIVERY SERVICE MODELS POSSIBLE. ALL THESE ATTRIBUTES OF A SUCCESSFUL SUBCONTRACTING MODEL HELP TO IMPROVE SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC CAN TRANSLATE INTO SAVING LIVES IN THIS FIELD AND REATING AN EFFICIENT EMERGENCY MEDICAL SYSTEM. AS YOU PART THE MSA HAVE REPEATEDLY MADE ATTEMPTS TO BAN THIS DELIVERY MODEL AND CONTINUES OUR EFFORTS TO THE CHAPTER THIRTEEN WILL MAKING PROCESS TODAY. CONTRA COSTA COUNTY HAVE BEEN UNDER CONSTANT STATE OF THREAT FROM THE NSA TWENTY EIGHTEEN CULMINATING IN THEIR OVER TO TIMES TO PROHIBIT SUBCONTRACTING TO THEIR CHAPTER THIRTEEN WILL MAKING PROCESS. THE REASONS FOR THEIR ACTIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN MADE CLEAR AB THREE NINE WILL ENSURE THIS MODEL CAN CONTINUE AND BE PURSUED BY OTHER COUNTIES DESPITE EMSA THE PARENT. BECAUSE THAT POSITION TO THE CONTRARY. EIGHT THREE NINE IS NOT OF. FOR COUNTY TO PROVIDE. SERVICES WITH THE STOCK. MODEL IS SOLIDIFIED. THROUGH STATUTE AS AN OPTION THAT REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR ANY COUNTY TO CONSIDER AND EVALUATE IN RELATION TO THEIR NEEDS UNDER UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT TO MOVE EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY NINE FORWARD IN ORDER TO PRESERVE SUBCONTRACTING OF AN OPTION FOR THE DELIVERY OF HIGH QUALITY. FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE EMERGENCY AMBULANCE SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE IN THE BUSINESS PROVIDING. SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC WE NEED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INNOVATE AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE F DELIVERY MODEL THAT ENHANCE OUR ABILITY. TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND GIVE THEM THE CARE THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT.

PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OFTEN REMAIN UNDER DIAGNOSED AND TREATED AND ALTHOUGH OBGYN PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO SCREEN FOR MATERNAL DEPRESSION THERE ARE STILL BARRIERS TO SCREENING AND REFERRALS.

GREAT THANK YOU- WE ARE WAITING FOR AUTHORS- SAYING IT WOULD YOU BE READY TO DO YOUR BILL THE SECRETARY. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER AUTHORS WE WOULD GO TO A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS YOUR CURRY TO PRESENT AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE YOU COULD DO IT FROM YOUR DESK THERE. MEMBERS AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE. ESTABLISHES A CLEAR GUIDELINES FOR WHEN ALL OF OIL PRODUCERS CAN USE THE TERM. CALIFORNIA IN THEIR LABELING. THIS BILL STRENGTHENS EXISTING LAW BY PROHIBITING THE REPRESENTATION THAT IN ALL OF OIL IS MADE ENTIRELY FROM CALIFORNIA ALL OF THE LIST THAT IS TRUE. EXISTING LAW PROHIBITS THE USE OF THE TERM CALIFORNIA ALL OF WORLD ON A LABEL ON THE FIFTH ALL OF WILL IS A 100% FROM CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER IF YOU USE A LABEL THE SAYS CALIFORNIA ALL OF FORM FOR CALIFORNIA OLIVE RANCH OR ANYTHING THAT INCLUDES CALIFORNIA. AND ALL OF THIS BUT NOT OIL. YOU ARE TECHNICALLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THE CURRENT LAW. BUT DEFINITELY NOT THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW. IF EITHER NAME INCLUDED THE WORD OIL IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION. THIS IS WHAT IS WHAT E KNOW AS A LOOPHOLE THIS LAW HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS SINCE THE MID NINETIES. THOSE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL DID NOT ORIGINALLY INTEND TO DECEIVE. BECAUSE THEY ALL STARTED BY PRODUCING HOW 2% CALIFORNIA ALL OF WELL. IF THE INTENTIONAL DECISION OF THESE COMPANIES TO CREATE THE LOOPHOLE THE FLOOD TO MY BILL. JUST A FEW YEARS AGO MY OPPONENTS PRODUCED A PRODUCT WITH A 100% CALIFORNIA ALL OF POLYPS. THAT PRODUCT WAS CHANGED SHORTLY AFTER TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE INVESTED BY AN EAST COAST AND DOWN WITH. I FELT I FULLY SUPPORT THEIR RIGHT TO PRODUCE A PRODUCT AS THEY CHOOSE. BUT USING CALIFORNIA ON A LABEL WITH THE BLEND USING AS LOW AS NOT A FAIR REPRESENTATION OF THE PRODUCT. AND BY THE WAY THAT NUMBER COMES DIRECTLY FROM THEM. WELL THEY DISCLOSE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW THE PRODUCT IS BLENDED MOST CONSUMERS ARE NOT AWARE. CALIFORNIA STANDARDS NOT EXCUSE ME CALIFORNIA'S STANDARDS ONLY APPLY 21100% CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL. THE USE OF THE TERM IS NOT AN INNOCENT MARKETING OF A BRAND IT DECEIVES THOSE WHO THINK THEY'RE GETTING A 100% CALIFORNIA OIL. WITH ALL THE STANDARDS WE MAKE OUR FARMERS LEVINE. THIS INACCURATE LABELING HAS NOT ONLY CAUSED CONSUMER CONFUSION BUT IT ALSO LED TO A DEPRESSION IN THE PRICE OF CALIFORNIA ALL OF OIL. IN PLACE CALIFORNIA GROWERS AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. IN FACT I'VE HEARD FROM OVER FOUR HUNDRED SMALL GROWERS EMPLOYEES INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS ASKING TO CLARIFY THE CALIFORNIA BRED FOR THIS REASON. AND WHILE THIS PRACTICE CONCERNS ME WHAT CONCERNS ME MORE IS THIS RECENT DEVELOPMENT IS A HUGE INCENTIVE FOR OTHER COMPANIES AND COUNTRIES TO DO THE SAME THING. AND SOME HAVE. AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE DOES NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL FOR CLARIFYING THE STANDARD OF WHAT SHOULD BE PROPERLY- CALIFORNIA BRANDED. THIS BILL TIGHTENS EXISTING LAW THAT HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES. IT'S MODELED AFTER APPELLATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA WINE INDUSTRY. EFFORT ORIGINALLY OPPOSED AS THE DEATH KNELL FOR THE NON NAPA AND SONOMA COUNTY. HIS BIGGEST CINEMA CALIFORNIA WINE INDUSTRY. FOR ONE WHICH IS FOSTERED THE INTERNATIONAL KNOWLEDGE EMIT A WARNING QUALITY WINES FROM SUCH PLACES OF CLARKSBURG LODI INTO MACULA. BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE THE HIGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL LABOR AND CONSUMER STANDARDS IN THE WORLD. CONSUMERS LOOK FOR CALIFORNIA AG PRODUCTS BECAUSE THEY ASSOCIATE CALIFORNIA WITH QUALITY AND SAFETY. ESTABLISHING STRONGER LABELING GUIDELINES FOR ALL OF OIL PRODUCERS AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE WILL ENSURE THAT THE CALIFORNIA BRAND IS PROTECTED IN CONSUMERS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE BUYING. PASSING AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE WILL PREVENT FOR CALIFORNIA BEST FROM BEING UNDERCUT BY BUSINESSES THAT MISREPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA NAME. AS A FARMER I HOPE TO PROTECT THE CALIFORNIA NAY AND FELLOW GROWERS I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN ME IN DOING THE SAME. TODAY I HAVE A HOPE- TWO PEOPLE TO TESTIFY SAMANTHA DORSEY. YEAH CAROLINE BEALE HUNTER. THANK YOU WE WILL- WILL HOLD OFF ON OUR WITNESSES BECAUSE WE HAVE A QUORUM AND LIKE THE SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. WHAT HERE. MAYES AGUIAR-CURRY. BIGELOW BONTA BURKE. CARILLO LARA MAIENSCHEIN MCCARTY. NAZARIAN. TO RODRIGUEZ. SANTIAGO WALDRON. WE ARE POOR WE HAVE A QUORUM SO THANK YOU AND NOW WILL GO- MISTER ROBERT OR WE CAN GO TO OUR- PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MOTION BY. MISTER NAZARIAN SECOND BY MR MCCARTY. SO GO AHEAD WITH THEIR WITNESSES PLEASE. CAN YOU HANDLE. OKAY ONE COME OUT OF HER. MATADORS HERE PRESIDENT OF MCEVOY RANCH. PLEASE GO AHEAD MISTER CHAIRMAN PROCEED GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WAS AGUIAR-CURRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND SAMANTHA. PRESIDENT MCEVOY RANCH AS WITH AGUIAR-CURRY JUST SAID THE BILL YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IT ISN'T GROUNDBREAKING. IT DOESN'T ATTEND OR REVERSE ANY CURRENT LAW AND IT'S ACTUALLY NOT REALLY THAT CONTROVERSIAL. EIGHTY FIVE THREE FIVE SIMPLY STRENGTHENS THE CURRENT LAW AND ALLOWS THE OLIVE OIL INDUSTRY TO CATCH UP TO THE REGULATIONS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE SET IN PLACE TO PROTECT TRUTH IN LABELING. IN THE WINE INDUSTRY OVER TEN YEARS AGO. ELECTION EXCUSE ME THE LEGISLATURE IN THE WINE INDUSTRY WERE BOTH AWARE OF- DECEPTIVE PRACTICES THAT OCCURRED WHEN SPECIFIC HIGH VALUE REGIONAL NAMES ARE BEING USED ON PRODUCT LABELS THAT DIDN'T ORIGINATE FROM THOSE EGIONS. AND NOW THE SAME DECEPTIVE PRACTICES ARE BEING USED IN ALL OF OIL AND THESE COMPANIES ARE USING THE ILLUSTRIOUS REPUTATIONS OF CALIFORNIA IN NAPA VALLEY ON THE ROLE OF OIL LABELS EVEN THOUGH THE OIL INSIDE THE BOTTLE. DOESN'T ORIGINATE FROM THOSE REGIONS. SO THE EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL THAT WE PRODUCE AND- ACTIVELY RANCH LIMON. WIFE WORKED FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS IT'S SUBJECT TO AGRICULTURAL AND PRODUCTION REGULATIONS. THAT ARE MUCH MORE EXACTING THAN THE REGULATIONS FOR PRODUCERS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND OF LEGISLATORS. YOU GUYS HAVE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB. OF SETTING THE BAR HIGH WITH LABOR STANDARDS EMISSION REGULATIONS WATER USAGE CONTROLS FOOD QUALITY STANDARDS INSPECTIONS. PAYROLL TAXES QUITMAN TAXES- PROPERTY TAXES. AND I COMMEND YOU GUYS I'M ACTUALLY REALLY THRILLED AND GRATEFUL THAT YOU'VE ENACTED ALL THESE POLICIES BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE LIVING IN OUR STATE AND I LIKE TAKING GOOD CARE OF OUR LABOR FORCE. IN OUR LAND. BUT TO BE COMPLIANT IN CALIFORNIA I HAVE TO CHARGE A PREMIUM PRICE FOR MY PRODUCT. BECAUSE IT'S PRODUCED IN A PREMIUM REGION. AND SO IT'S SUPER DISRUPTIVE TO MY BUSINESS AND EVERY OTHER REAL CALIFORNIA ALTHOUGH OIL PRODUCER. WHEN WE HAVE TO COMPETE AGAINST THE FOREIGN OIL THAT IS PRODUCED WITH FEWER REGULATIONS. AT A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST STRUCTURE. BUT THEN AS BRAZENLY LABELED WITH THE CALIFORNIA NAME OR THE NAPA VALLEY NAMES. NONE OF US ARE OBJECTING TO IMPORTED OLIVE OIL I HAVE NO DESIRE TO RESTRICT THE FREE TRADE OF ALL OF OIL. I'M JUST ASKING THAT THE THAT THE LABEL IS ACCURATE SO. AS I MENTIONED AT THE START THIS ISN'T UNUSUAL OR GROUNDBREAKING. LEGISLATION IT JUST BRINGS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE UP TO DATE THE SAME PARAMETERS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE ALREADY PUT IN PLACE. FOR OTHER FOOD INDUSTRIES. SO THANKS FOR YOUR TIME I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE FOR AB FIVE THREE FIVE. THANK YOU- WE THERE'S A SECOND WITNESS. YES THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WHAT A MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE TODAY MY NAME IS CAROLYN BIEL HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE- TODAY HE WENT TO NATION A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBE IN YOLO COUNTY AND COSPONSORED AB FIVE THREE FIVE ALL OF OIL LATELY. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE YO TODAY HE OPENED UP A SMALL BINGO HALL WHICH IS SIX TRANSFORM IN TO WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS CACHE CREEK CASINO RESORT. IN THE TRI IS WORKED. MISLEAD AND WHAT WE'RE ONCE THEY TRY WITHOUT BASICALLY. LIKE WATER INTO. IS NOW I THOUGHT TO WORK OF THEIR AND- LAND. GROWING A Y. VARIETY OF CAREFULLY CROP. ONE OF WHICH IS ALL OF TREES. THE TRIBE OF MIDDLE NAME FACT HILLS THE ROLE BLUE HILL IT IS. BY IS HIGHLY WORLD. MOST RECENTLY A AWARD AT THE TWENTY TWENTY NEW YORK. INTERNATIONAL OLIVE OIL COMPETITION. I THE TRIBE OF THE PRODUCER OF ALL OIL MAY BY LAW DIFFERENCE. A FEW DETAILS MAKE CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL UNIQUE INVEST OUR THE CLIMATE THE UNIQUE MEDITERRANEAN LIKE CLIMATE MAKES THE REGION AN IDEAL PLACE TO GROW OLIVE TREES. AND THE TRIBE HAS INVESTED A LOT OF TIME AND RESOURCES INTO BUILDING A STATE OF THE ART ALL OF MAIL TO SERVE GROWERS IN THE REGION. NEXT TECHNIQUE AT SECOND HILL TO TRY TO USE THE MOST MODERN GROWING AND HARVESTING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS MECHANIZED HARVESTERS. MEDIUM DENSITY VARIETY GIVING ALL OF GIVING CUSTOMERS MORE FLAVOR PROFILE TO ENJOY. AND FINALLY LOCATION SECOND HILDA STRATEGICALLY LOCATED. IT'S CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE LOCAL ORCHARD ENABLE ALL OF TO BE MAILED IMMEDIATELY AFTER HARPER TO PRESERVE THE FRESHNESS NEEDED TO PRODUCE A HIGH QUALITY VIRGIN OLIVE OIL. THIS ATTENTION TO DETAIL MATTERS. OBVIOUSLY AN APPEAL TO MAKE CHEAPER IMPORTED OILS WITH SOME CALIFORNIA OIL TO USE THE GOLDEN STATE'S REPUTATION BY PLACING IT ON THE LOCAL TO IMPROVE PROFIT MARGINS. BUT IT IS UNETHICAL AND UNSAFE TO PULL CONSUMERS JUST WAIT AND UNFAIR TO PRODUCERS LIKE TO TRY. TO PUT IN THE EXTRA TIME EFFORT AND RESOURCES TO PRODUCE QUALITY CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL. AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE PROTECTS CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL. FIVE YEARS AGO YOUR TD HE WORKED WITH THE FAMILY MEMBER WALKED TO ESTABLISH LABELING REGULATIONS IN EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE FIFTY CLARIFIES WHAT THE BILL ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO DO.

WE LAUNCH NEW NEWLINE BLENDED WITH ARC THAT BLENDER CALIFORNIA ALL OF OIL WITH HIGH QUALITY OLIVE OIL FROM. HER PARTNERS IN ARGENTINA PORTUGAL AND CHILE. TODAY THIS LIKE COMPLIMENTS OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCTS THAT CALIFORNIA LINES AS WELL AS A CULINARY LINES OF ALL OF THE LOAN VEGETABLE OIL BLENDS. ACCURATELY LABELED ALL AVAILABLE WITH WHEELS FOR MULTIPLE REGIONS OR OTHER VEGETABLE OILS IS A COMMON PRACTICE IN OUR INDUSTRY AND IS ALLOWED UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS. SUPPORTERS OF AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE ARGUE THAT NEW LAWS ARE NEEDED BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE CONSUMERS ARE QUOTE. BEING TRICKED BY PRODUCTS LIKE OUR GLOBAL PLAN SINCE OUR TWENTY THREE ALL TRADEMARK. HAS A WORD CALIFORNIA AND IT. FURTHER THEY ARGUE THE LOWER PRICE OF OUR GLOBAL BY MINUS DEPRESSING THE VALUE OF A 100% CALIFORNIA MARKET. AND MAKING IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO COMPETE. THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE IN HERE THE FACTS. FIRST OUR LABELS DO NOT CONFUSE CONSUMERS. WE WORK HARD TO DIFFERENTIATE OUR LINES CALLING UP THE COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN ON THE FRONT OF OUR LABELS IN LARGE FONTS WE ALSO HAVE A GLOBAL PLAN CALL OUT. ON THE FRONT OF OUR LABELS. AN INDEPENDENT CONSUMER RESEARCH TEST 90% OF CONSUMERS COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR HOW TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA LINE. AND OUR GLOBAL LAND. ANY CLAIM BY SUPPORTERS OF THE OF THIS BILL THAT OUR COMPANIES TRYING TO TRICK PEOPLE IS OFFENSIVE TO ME IN OUR COMPANY. SECOND THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A 100% CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL ARE UP SINCE THE LAUNCH OF OUR GLOBAL PLAN. IN THE TWO YEARS TO LAUNCH A GLOBAL BRAND OUR NEW PRICING STRATEGIES AND HELP DRIVE THE AVERAGE PRICE PER LITRE A 100% CALIFORNIA ITEMS UP 28% THIRD THE 100% OF THE MARKET IS THRIVING SINCE THE LAUNCH OF GLOBAL PLANT. TODAY ALL OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCERS ARE SELLING A HUNDRED TWENTY THREE PERCENT. MORE LEADERS AN AGGREGATE THAT THEY DIDN'T EARLY TWENTY NINETEEN. WITH A GLOBAL PLAN LAUNCHED. R. OLIVE OIL IS THE HIGHEST QUALITY IN OUR LABELS ARE TRUTHFUL AND MORE TRANSPARENT THAN ANY BLENDED ALL WILL TODAY. AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE WILL VIOLATE OUR COMMERCIAL SPEECH RIGHTS AND THE RIGHTS OF OTHER LONGSTANDING BRANDS WITH WILLIAM SANOMA. BY LIMITING THE USE OF OUR VALUABLE TRADEMARKS. FURTHER ANY ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS COMPATIBLE LEVINE LAWS AROUND THE USE OF THE WORD NAPA. IN A TRADEMARK FAILS TO CONSIDER. FEDERAL PREEMPTION EXISTING FOOD LAW THE COULD OVERRULE A STATE MEASURE LIKE THIS. WE SUPPORT TRANSPARENCY IN LABELING. BUT CANNOT SUPPORT MEASURES THAT SEEK TO PENALIZE OURS IN OUR GROWTH YEARS INVESTMENT IN OUR BRAND SIMPLY BECAUSE OUR COMPETITORS. HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT WITH A BUSINESS STRATEGY. IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT I OPPOSE EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE AND ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OVER TO THE PHONE LINE FOR OUR SECOND WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO BRING IT BACK TO THE OPERATOR FOR WILL TAKE- PUBLIC COMMENT- FOR OR AGAINST THE BILL JUST THEIR NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISTER OPERATOR- WE HAVE ONE NUMBER TO NINETY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY OUR- A LINE NUMBER ONE EIGHTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. MY NUMBER ONE EIGHTEEN. THANKS CALLER PLEASE. I THINK MY NUMBER THREE THIRTY TO PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY NEXT CALLER PLEASE IN. MY NUMBER ONE EIGHTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. AFTERNOON THAT THE ONLY MAC MILLER AND I'M CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILY WINEMAKERS CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE. THANK YOU. WE HAVE NO ORDERS IN Q. OKAY THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- MR BIGELOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND QUESTIONS TO THE AUTHOR PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU- IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF AGREEMENT ON BOTH SIDES. WITH RESPECT TO THIS THEY ALL WANT TO PROTECT. THE BRAND THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE CALIFORNIA IS TRULY BEING CALIFORNIA OIL. THE REAL ISSUE COMES DOWN TO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT TRADEMARK AND THERE'S ONE THAT HAS. IN PARTICULAR THAT HAS A TRADEMARK NAME AND IT MAKES IT REAL CHALLENGING SO THE REALITY IS IT COMES DOWN TO. FOR THE QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. HOW DOES YOUR BILL PLAN TO GET AROUND THE PREEMPTION OF THE FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FOR LABOR WITH. AND THE FEDERAL TRADEMARK PROTECTIONS. THAT ARE GRANTED TO THAT. BUSINESS. THANK YOU- FRAZIER WOULD YOU HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS MAYBE I CAN DO IN MY IN MY CLOTHES AS WELL. IF I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS SO. ALL RESPECT THAT INTERNAL WORK WITH THAT- IF WE LOOK DAD MAYBE SOME OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MODEL LIST SIMILAR TO LET'S SAY THE NAPA MODEL WHERE THE WINE INDUSTRY. REGULATED ITSELF TO MAKE SURE THAT IT HAD. AT LEAST A MINIMUM PERCENTAGE OF. ORIGIN FROM CALIFORNIA FOR A REGIONAL AREA SUCH AS IT IS TODAY WITH 85% THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE MODEL HERE IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT- WHAT THE DIFFICULTY IS WITH WINE WINE IS PROTECTED UNDER THE TWENTY FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION BUT OLIVE OIL IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S IN FACT IT WOULD EVEN BE IN THIS COMMITTEE IF IT WAS WHITE IT WOULD BE SOMEPLACE ELSE BUT BECAUSE THIS IS A FOOD AND THERE ARE FEDERAL LAWS REGULATING FOOD LABELING HOW DO YOU PROPOSE. THAT THIS BILL AVOID. THE VERY REGULATIONS IT'S GOING TO NOW BE CHARGED WITH VIOLATING. THE COUPLE OF THE THINGS THAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR IS THAT- THE CALIFORNIA- FORMS- CALIFORNIA OIL. THEY LAUNCH THEIR NEW LINE WITH BALLOONS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AND THEY COMPILE AND- THEY COMPLIED WITH A HUNDRED PERCENT- REQUIREMENT BEFORE THEN. THEY WERE PURCHASED BY ENDOWMENT AND SO THEY HAVE NOT BEEN DOING THIS FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS JUST FOR STARTERS. THEY LEAD THE WAY ON CREATING CALIFORNIA BRAND WE NEED TO GIVE THEM A GOOD THEY DID A GREAT THING UNFORTUNATE ALL THEY'VE BEEN THEY'VE NOW LEAD THE WAY TO GO AROUND IT. AND THAT'S WHERE MY CONCERN IS WITH THIS. THEY WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING THE LABELING WAS FINE AT THAT TIME AND THEN NOW IT'S NOT THE LABELING IT WAS THE PRODUCT THE CHANGE IN THE PRODUCT CHANGE FROM 1100% ALL CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL. TO A BLEND. AND THAT'S WHERE BUT THAT'S WHAT THE ISSUE IS. THANK YOU FOR THAT- ANSWER I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALL FIND. DIFFICULT HERE BECAUSE THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT ARE REALLY BEFORE US MISTER CHAIRMAN. WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES. IT GETS INTO THE CHALLENGES OF DO WE WANT TO TAKE ON OTHER THINGS TO SAY CALIFORNIA. BY CALIFORNIA PIZZA. DO WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT OTHER IN THE ENTITIES THAT. ANDERSON VALLEY- BREWERY WERE PICKING UPON REGIONAL AREAS. THIS GETS REALLY DOWN PRETTY WEEDY AND DIFFICULT FOR US TO REGULATE BECAUSE IT OPENS A SLIPPERY SLOPE TO A LOT OF ISSUES. IN THE STATE. I THINK IN RESPECT FOR THE TWO PARTIES HERE THERE'S STILL ROOM FOR US TO HAVE THEM COME TOGETHER AND WORK ON AN ANSWER. OF ADDRESSING THEIR CONCERNS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF- TEAK. OIL PRODUCERS IN THIS STATE AND THEY'RE BLENDING. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO THEY PLAN AND USE THE WORD CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S MY REAL CONCERN BECAUSE I THINK THE TRADEMARK. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THAT I IDENTIFIED IN THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE THE COMPROMISING SITUATION BECAUSE ACROSS THE LINE INTO PROTECTIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW SO I THINK THIS BILL IS A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE AND IT'S WORKING BECAUSE AS THE AUTHOR JUST ADDRESSED. TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE OF BRINGING DIFFERENT BLAND'S FORD. THEY'VE ACTUALLY ALREADY COVERED AND STAYED WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THIS WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO OR WHAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO DO YOU SEE IT ALL LABELS ON EVERY BOTTLE. THAT'S PRESENTED. SO IT'S ALREADY IDENTIFIED SO THEY'RE MEETING THE NEEDS SO NOW COMES DOWN TO REALLY. SOMEONE OR SOMEONES ARE CONTESTING THE USE OF THE NAME. CALIFORNIA RANCH. CALIFORNIA OLIVE RANCH CALIFORNIA FARM SOMEBODY'S REALLY JUST TRYING TO ADDRESS. THAT TRADEMARK NAME THAT'S WHAT THIS DEBATE IS REALLY ABOUT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LABELING. IS BIG PEOPLE FIGHTING EACH OTHER. I DON'T THINK THIS BILL I'M SORRY I RESPECT THE AUTHOR AND I APPRECIATE WHAT SHE'S TRYING TO DO HERE BUT I THINK IT'S PREMATURE FOR US TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND MOVE IT FORWARD. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU. YOU CAN RESPOND SO LET'S REMEMBER THAT- THIS IS ALREADY EXISTING LAW THAT REQUIRES THAT ALL OF THE OIL LABELED WITH TERM CALIFORNIA MUST CONSIST OF A 100% CALIFORNIA GROWN FOLLOWS AND SO THAT'S BEEN THERE- FOR YEARS AND SO THERE'S NOTHING THAT THIS CHANGE HERE- I DO AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO GO ON AMAZON THE NEW WORLD CUP OLIVE OIL AND YOU SEE THIS BRAND. PEOPLE ACCIDENTALLY GET THE WRONG ONE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T READ THE- THE LABEL ON THE- SO I YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU IS THAT WE HAVE PUT. OUR CALIFORNIA FARMERS ARE HELD TO SOME OF THE HIGHEST. ENVIRONMENTALLY QUALITY STANDARDS IN THE NATION AND THEY GIVE THEY DEPEND ON US GETTING ON GETTING PREMIUM PRICE. FOR A PREMIUM PRODUCT. AND I'M JUST GOING TO ALWAYS FIGHT FOR MY FARMERS AND I'M GONNA MAKE SURE THAT. WE CONTINUE IN USE THAT HERE. WE CONTINUE TO BEAT HIM UP. AND I'M NOT GOING TO BEAT HIM UP AND I WANT THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND THE CALIFORNIA BRAND TO CONTINUE TO BE IS KNOWN. THROUGHOUT THE NATION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS. IN THE NUMBER. THANK YOU- MR MACE. IT I THINK INTO IT TO THE AUTHOR WHEN USED IN YOUR OPENING YOU UP AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S CLEAR I'M LOOKING IN THE ANALYSIS NOW THAT UNDER EXISTING LAW- BEFORE THIS THAT- BED YOU CAN'T SAY YOU'RE CALIFORNIA ALL OF OIL- AND THAT IF THE CURRENT. BRAND NAME WAS CALIFORNIA ALL OF OIL BRANCH FOR INSTANCE THAT WOULD ALREADY BE- WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN. ILLEGAL TO BE ABLE TO DO THE UNDER EXISTING LAW DID I HEAR THAT CORRECTLY. SO WHEN BUT IN THE PAST AS I SAID THEY HAD GOTTEN THEY WERE CALIFORNIA ALL OF OIL THEY WERE A HUNDRED PERCENT. THEY WERE PURCHASED. WHEN THEY'RE PURCHASED. THE NEW OWNERS- CONTINUE TO USE THE LABEL AND THEY HAVE OTHER BLENDED PRODUCT I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE PRODUCT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE. WHEN YOU MIL ALL OF WALES IN CALIFORNIA IT IS AN ART IT IS AN ART AND THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING IT OUR FARMERS AND OUR MIDDLE MIDDLE PEOPLE- HAVE HIGH QUALITY EQUIPMENT. AND WE HAVE TO I THINK WE SHOULD HONOR THAT SO WHERE I'MGOING WITH THIS IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REALIZE THAT ADDITIONALLY THEY HAVE THE RIGHT THEY HAD THE WHEN THEY ARE PURCHASED BY SOMEONE ELSE I FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE UNDERMINE OUR FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA ALL FARMERS. OKAY I AM- I HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION LAST WEEK WITH THAT THE COMPANY IN QUESTION. I ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH THEIR LABELING- AND- I THINK OF ANYBODY THAT LOOKED AT AND I THINK THEY'VE COME A LONG WAY IN MAKING SURE THAT TO SEPARATE- THE CALIFORNIA. BRAND TO THE OTHER BLENDED FROM UP FROM- THAT WITH OILS THAT ARE THAT ARE GLOBAL I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS- TODAY AND IN MY LINE OF THINKING FOR SUPPORTING IT TODAY. IS THAT IF WE COULD GO BACK ON THEM IT TABULAR ROSS SAID IF WE KNEW. IN THE FUTURE- WHAT WHAT WHAT DID THE MARKET PLACE WAS GOING TO LOOK LIKE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA. OF FOR US AS CALIFORNIANS TO PROTECT THE CALIFORNIA BRAND NOT JUST IN REGARDS TO ALL OF OIL- BUT FOR ALL THINGS AND IT WAS. DOWN MY- MY OTHER COLLEAGUE SPOKE ABOUT THE STEVEN KING OF QUEBEC CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN. AND IF YOU GO THROUGH A GROCERY STORE NOW YOU CAN SEE A BUNCH OF BRANDS SO NOT. PRODUCTS DESCRIBING PRODUCTS BUT THEIR ACTUAL BRAND USING THE CALIFORNIA NAME AND I THINK THERE'S A QUESTION. ABOUT MAKE THE ABOUT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD PROTECT AND WHO OWNS- THAT THAT THAT NAME I NOW WE CAN START TO GO DOWN TO ALL THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND- WE GO DOWN TO CITIES AND ALL OF THAT DOES WELL BUT- I DO THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. AND IF THIS HAD COME BEFORE US- I WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED IT- AND KNOWING THAT- THERE WASN'T A COMPANY THAT HAD A TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD TRADEMARKS ALL BE SUPPORTING IT. TODAY AND ALSO JUST MY AFFECTION FOR THE AUTHORED KNOWING THAT- SHE'S A GOOD LEGISLATOR AND SHE'S GONNA BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH- SOME OF THESE THINGS WORK IT AND WORK IT OUT AS IT WORKS TO THE PROCESS- SO AGAIN I'LL BE SUPPORTING US TODAY. MISS FOR. MR FLOOR AND THEN THE BONTA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- KIND OF WHAT I'VE WAS GONNA SAY IS ALREADY BEEN STE STATED BUT I DON'T REALLY WANT TO REITERATE IT BECAUSE I AM IN THE SUPPORT THIS BILL. BUT I DO ACTUALLY THINK THAT. THE COMPANY IN QUESTION- IS DOING WHAT IS REQUIRED OF THEM. WE CAN HAVE THE CONVERSATION IS THAT ENOUGH MAYBE NOT. BUT I JUST PULLED UP THEIR WEBSITE RIGHT HERE. AND. THE TOP ROCKER THAT ABSOLUTELY SAYS CALIFORNIA OLIVE RANCH. AND THIS IS ON THE GLOBAL SERIES. BUT AT THE BOTTOM. IT TALKS ABOUT WHERE SOME OF THE OTHER OILS ARE COMING FROM. THEN YOU GO TO THE HOW 2% CALIFORNIA PART OF IT. IT'S LABELED A 100% CALIFORNIA. I AM SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE AS A GUY THAT CAME FROM AG. ANY AMOUNT OF REGULATORY BURDEN AND WHAT IT MEANS TO DO BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. PROTECTING THE CALIFORNIA BRAND. IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME. IT'S INCREDIBLY- FRUSTRATING AT TIMES QUITE FRANKLY WHEN YOU SEE OTHER PRODUCTS IMPORTED UNDER OUR NAME KNOWING WHAT IT COSTS OUR GROWERS TO PRODUCE THAT COMMODITY. BUT I DO FIND IT SOMEWHAT INTERESTING THAT THIS PARTICULAR ALL OF OIL IS BECOMING KIND THE NEXUS FOR THIS FIGHT. IT'S KIND OF THE TIP OF THE SPEAR AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS UNFORTUNATE. BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE. THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW. THAT THEY ARE PROPERLY LABELING THINGS MAYBE THE FONT SIZE CHANGE MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE CAN DO WE CAN HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS. BUT I THINK AS A INSTITUTION. IF THE TOP ROCKER ON YOUR NAME IS GOING TO BE CALIFORNIA IN THE BIGGEST FATHER WE HAVE. IT NEEDS TO COME FROM CALIFORNIA. I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT. SO I AM SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE I DO TRUST THE AUTHOR AND SHE'S VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS AS WELL. BUT I DO THINK THERE'S SOME WORK TO BE DONE HERE AND THERE IS A HAPPY MEDIUM TO BE FOUND BECAUSE- WHAT I CARE ABOUT. IS PROTECTING CALIFORNIA AG AND OUR CALIFORNIA BRAND THANK YOU. MR BONTA. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I JUST WANT TO SAY I APPRECIATE YOUR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES I DO I KNOW THIS IS THE FIRST THE HOUSE THE FIRST COMMITTEE I AM GONNA BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY I THINK OUR DIALOGUE AND INCLUDING SOME OF THE IDEAS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE UP LIFTED SOME PATHWAYS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO PERHAPS SPRING FROM THE BILL AS AS YOU GO FORWARD AND KNOWING YOU O BE THOUGHTFUL OPEN MINDED AUTHOR THAT YOU ARE. I HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN THE BILL GOING FORWARD BUT- I WILL BE VOTING IN SUPPORT TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR ON GOING. STEWARDSHIP OF THE BILL. THANK YOU- ANYONE ELSE. GO AHEAD IF YOU'D LIKE YOU MISTER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ONE. ONE MOMENT AND THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR INDULGING BUT- I KNOW I'VE ASKED FOR US TO NOT MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD BUT- I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE ENOUGH VOTES FOR THIS TO HAPPEN BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO. OFFER IS TO THE AUTHOR. I'M WILLING TO LAY OFF AND TAKE BACK THAT REQUEST. IF YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH IF. YOU AND I COULD WORK OUT ON THIS A LITTLE CLOSE. LIKE I'VE- I KNOW. YOU AND I ARE VERY GOOD FRIENDS AND SO THIS IS AN ODD PLACE FOR US TO BE. BECAUSE WE BOTH REPRESENT LOVE AGRICULTURE BUT IF WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THIS IS BILL MOOS FOR MISTER CHAIRMAN. I WOULD APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE I DO THINK WE HEARD ENOUGH FROM ENOUGH MEMBERS HERE. THAT THERE ARE SOME COMMON GROUND TO MAYBE MAKE. ALL THE PARTIES COME TOGETHER BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY HERE IS. WILLING TO WORK IT OUT. OPTIMISTIC. FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST REMIND YOU THAT CALIFORNIA PIZZA THE KITCHEN IS A- NOT OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT'S A WAY OF LIFE IT'S A LOT OF THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK. HEY I'M NOT. MOST OF THE PER. I APPRECIATE THAT LED IT I DO WANNA THANK YOU FOR THE CALL THAT AND I I I AM I AM HAS FOR AND I MY BOYS TO GO CRAZY BECAUSE I KNOW MEET. MS ASSEMBLY BIG AND WE'VE THIS IS OF OUR FARMERS AND I JUST THINK THAT- I AM PROUD THAT I BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT OUR OUR STATE HAS THE BEST QUALITY FOR FOOD. IN THE WORLD AND PEOPLE APPRECIATE THAT SO AGAIN I JUST SIMPLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. AND I THINK- I TO WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- I- I FIND THE WHOLE DISCUSSION REALLY REALLY INTERESTING AND SO I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU BECAUSE- YOU KNOW AS AS MISTER BIGELOW SAID THIS IS A- A LOT OF THIS FEELS LIKE IT'S A TRADEMARK ISSUE HERE. SO YOU DON'T HAVE IT JUST WOULD PROVIDE SERVER MY FEEBLE BRAIN BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE STUFF WE USUALLY DEAL WITH I MEAN THIS IS I KNOW YOU THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO AGRO THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE HERE I MEAN NINE I MEAN. NEVER MIND I WILL WILL WILL STAY AWAY FROM ALL OF WILL. BUT BUT- SO YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION TO WIN IT THE BRENT THE TRADEMARK CALIFORNIA OLIVE BRANCH IS HAS A 100% OLIVE OIL CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL IN IT THAT'S THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO THAT THIS CALIFORNIA CENTER PERCENT ALL OF WELL JUST LIKE THE EXISTING LOSSES RIGHT OKAY ALL RIGHT AND THEN SO YOU SAID AND THEN YOU ALSO SAID THAT IF YOU'RE ON AMAZON AND LOOKING AT THIS IT GETS CONFUSING I WOULD JUST SAY MAYBE WE OUGHT TO BE BUYING THESE IN THE STORE YEAH THE MAYBE ON AMAZON IN YOUR FRONT AND EVERYBODY WOULD BE BETTER OFF FOR THAT. BECAUSE I CAN'T READ WEBSITE BUT I SEE ON AMAZON EITHER UNLESS I BLOW IT UP AND I DO ON MY PHONE DOESN'T WORK SO GOOD SO- SO I DO APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE WHERE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM AND I UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE BETTER I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- AS WITH MISTER FLORA. IT'S PRETTY IT IS OBVIOUS ON THEIR LABEL THAT IT'S TO ME AS A CONSUMER OF I'M LOOKING AT IT WHEN IT SAYS GLOBAL I'M THINKING OKAY THIS CALIFORNIA GLOBAL AND THEN I LOOK FURTHER TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT MEANS AND I SEE WITH THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT THAT MEANS SO. I'M I'M I MOVED THE BILL FOR TODAY AND HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO TALK WITH- WITH THE OPPOSITION HERE AND- AND JUST SAY I'M NOT. SUPER ANXIOUS TO HAVE ANOTHER FOOD. HEY FRANK. SO- THAT WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CALL CARE THE THEY'LL GO TO THE ALL OF WHILE AND START AT LOUTH HERE TO YOU THAT IF NOT YOUR SPOUSE OR WHOEVER WILL START LOOKING AT THE- YOU KNOW I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I- EDUCATE MY COLLEAGUES. AND I TOOK ABOUT TWENTY WOMEN OUT TO ALL OF OIL LANDED AND THE MAIL. AND EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES AND- YOU KNOW THE BEST I CAN DO IS EDUCATE OUR MARKET COLLEAGUES BUT ANYWAY WITHOUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND I APPRECIATE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE THEY'VE TRIED TO CHANGE YOUR LABELS THEY'VE DONE FOUR DIFFERENT. LABELS AND FOR DIFFERENT YEARS- IN THE- FACE OF DEATH WE ARE BOTH. THANK YOU SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER NAZARIAN I BELIEVE THE SEGWAY ESTIMATES.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF EIGHTY SIX SIX SIX A NUMBER I DID NOT SELECT. THIS IS A BILL. THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE AND LACK OF DIVERSITY WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE TO TREAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THANK YOU- WE'LL KNOW BEFORE THE CURRENT PANDEMIC RAN AS WELL AS DURING THIS PANDEMIC OUR COUNTRY HAS GRAPPLED WITH AN OPIOID EPIDEMIC. IN OUR STATE WHILE TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION HAVE HAD A DIAGNOSABLE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER THIS PAST YEAR ONLY ONE IN TEN HAVE RECEIVED TREATMENT. IN BEHAVIOR HEALTH WORKFORCE WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS DEVOTED RESOURCES FOR MENTAL HEALTH THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER TREATMENT SYSTEM HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY LACKING. DUE TO A CHRONIC SHORTAGE IN OUR WORKFORCE. OUR WORKFORCE IS ALSO FAILED TO REFLECT THE DIVERSITY AND LINGUISTIC BACKGROUNDS OF OUR STATE'S POPULATION. THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS A SHORTAGE LACK OF DIVERSITY BY PROVIDING TUITION ASSISTANCE FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING EXPENSES AND INCREASING LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR EDUCATION MATERIALS. AS WELL AS CONDUCT A STATEWIDE NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT WORKFORCE. BY ADDING OVER A THOUSAND CERTIFIED BEHAVIOR HEALTH WORKERS AND LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR RE BUSTS AND COVER CULTURALLY COMPETENT FIELD.

I SERVE AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WE ADVOCATE FOR THERAPEUTIC RATHER THAN PUNITIVE DRUG POLICIES EVERY COUPLE. HUNDRED OPTION STRATEGY. DRUG USE AND DRUG OVER DEATH CAN TO RISE MORE DRAMATICALLY SO BECAUSE OF THE ISOLATION AND SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS OF COVERT NINETEEN AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. HAVE RISEN BY 13% UNITED STATES WE KNOW THAT THIS IMPACTS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND POVERTY DISPROPORTIONATELY HOMELESS POPULATIONS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE. OUR ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN WORKING TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS BY EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF COVERT NINETEEN OPIOID OVERDOSE AND SYSTEMIC RACISM AND ADVOCATING FOR PATHWAYS JERRY KAPLAN MANY PATHWAYS TO RECOVERY. THE NEED FOR SERVICES IS DRAMATIC MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IN THE PAST YEAR AND MILLIONS MORE ARE LIVING WITH AN UNDIAGNOSED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. YET THE WORK FORCE TO TREAT THIS DISORDER IS GROSSLY UNDERFUNDED. CALIFORNIA'S BEHIND THE NATIONAL PERCENTAGE QUALIFIED COUNSELORS IN ADDICTION TREATMENT PROVIDERS WE HAVE A LACK OF QUALIFIED STAFF TO ADDRESS THIS MOUNTING CRISIS. IN ADDITION WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THE DIVERSE CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS AND LANGUAGES THAT THE PEOPLE WHO NEED SERVICES. ARE SUBSTANTIVE DISORDER COUNSELORS REMAIN PREDOMINANTLY WHITE. POSING A BARRIER TO THOSE COMMUNITIES MOST AT RISK. AB SIX SIXTY SIX WHAT ADDRESS A SHORTAGE BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO EDUCATION ALLOCATE THE WAIVERS FOR CERTIFICATION EXPENSES AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT.

THANK YOU- I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE BILL I WAS EXCITED ENOUGH TO BE A CO AUTHOR WHICH I THINK IS HAPPENING SO- BUT YOU KNOW IT GOES BACK. A LONG WAY BECAUSE IN OUR SYSTEM HE WHEN I SAW THE BILL REMINDED ME OF EVEN LEGISLATION I HAD DONE- AB TWENTY EIGHT OH FOUR BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- REQUIRED DHS TO PERFORM. THE STATE WIDE NEEDS ASSESSMENT REPORT EVALUATING IN THE STATE OF THE S. U. D. WORKFORCE. IN EACH COUNTY AND THEN HAD AN EMPHASIS ON USE AS WELL AS- CONDUCTING A QUALITY ASSESSMENT FOR ADDICTION TREATMENT PREVENTION AND INTEGRATED WORKFORCES. SO IN THAT BUILT IMMENSELY DIED IN APPROPRIATIONS. AND THEN WE GO TO ANOTHER BILL THAT- I ALSO AUTHORED AB NINETEEN SIXTY THREE. WHICH WOULD INCENTIVIZE PROVIDERS FOR MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT AND- AS WE KNOW WE ONLY HAVE 2% OF PROVIDERS THAT EVEN CAN DO MATH- ARE CERTIFIED TO DO IT. SO YOU KNOW WHAT POINT ARE WE GONNA STOP THE RHETORIC AND ACTUALLY START TO FUND THESE THINGS BECAUSE IT IS A PARTY AND THIS BILL IS A PRIORITY SO WE REALLY NEED TO YOU KNOW SAY IS A STATE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE GONNA FUNDED MORE FINALLY GOING TO GET THESE THINGS DONE SO.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE BUT THERE IS A MOTION BEFORE US- MOTION BY MISTER FLORES SECOND BY MISTER MASON NEW THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT I WOULD AYE MAYES. MAYES AYE AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY AYE BIGELOW. BONTA BURKE AREA. FLORA FOR AYE MAIENSCHEIN RT. NAZARIANNAZARIAN I TO ARRIVE RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ I SANTIAGO WALDRON WALDRON HIGH. HAS EIGHT AS EIGHT BILLS OUT WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHERSTO ADD ON CONGRATULATIONS MISTER CHU THE NEXT BILL IS NOT A NUMBER SEVEN AB ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR EIGHTY ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS. MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER FOR THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE INCLUDING FOLKS ON THEIR SPOUSES PLANS FOR YOUNG ADULTS WHO ARE ON THEIR PARENTS PLAN UNTIL THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX. IN THESE INSTANCES THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER MAY RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT CARE THAT THE PATIENT WILL NOT WANT REVEALED. IN SOME CASES IT COULD EVEN BE DANGEROUS. IT TRANS YOUTH MAY NOT WANT THEIR PARENTS KNOW THEY'RE TRANSITIONING OR ACCESSING GENDER AFFIRMING HEALTH CARE SERVICES. A WOMAN ACCESSING REPRODUCTIVE CARE OR CARE RELATED TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENT MAY NOT WANT HER PARTNER JANELLE. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS THE PATIENT TO REQUEST INFORMATION RELATED TO THE SERVICES NOT BE SENT TO THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER. THROUGH A CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS REQUEST. HOWEVER THERE IS NO STANDARDIZED PROCESS SO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THESE REQUESTS HAS BEEN HAPHAZARD. YOU CAN FOLLOW THE LINK WITH THE STATE IF INSURANCE COMPANIES FAIL O ACCOMMODATE THE REQUEST BUT BY THAT TIME THE DAMAGE IS DONE. THIS BILL WOULD IMPROVE ON EXISTING PROTECTIONS IN TWO WAYS. IT ESTABLISHES AUTOMATIC CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR SENSITIVE SERVICES ENSURING THAT PRIVACY IS NOT VIOLATED. AND IT WOULD EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF SENSITIVE SERVICES TO INCLUDE BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND TRANSGENDER HEALTH CARE. TO ENSURE MORE PEOPLE HAVE PRIVACY PROTECTED. MY OFFICE HAS BEEN A CONVERSATION WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS AS WE ALL AGREE THAT WE DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO AVOID CRITICAL CARE IN ORDER TO PREVENT A POLICY HOLDER FOR FINDING OUT ABOUT THAT CARE. AND WITH THAT WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR FIRST WITNESS PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. GO TO OUR FIRST WITNESS. ACTUALLY OPEN OF THE LINE FOR ACTUALLY OF TWO WITNESSES WHO MUST OPEN THE LINE FOR BOTH WITNESSES PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISTRUST RAIDER WHEN THE WITNESSES ARE ON PLEASE- START WITH THE LISA FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS I'M WITH THE MOB ARAMBULA PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA SEVEN FIVE HUNDRED AFFILIATES WHO COLLECTIVELY PROVIDE NEARLY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION VISITS ANNUALLY TO PATIENTS ACROSS THE STATE I'M HERE IN SUPPORT AND EIGHTY ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR TO CONTINUE-THE IMPORTANT WORK ADVOCATES AND LAWMAKERS UNDERTOOK WHEN THEY PASSED. SB ONE THIRTY EIGHT. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SPECIAL HEALTH WILL SPEAK LATER PATIENTS CONTINUE TO FIND IT DIFFICULT TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW. FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S CALL CENTERS CONFIDENTIALITY THAT THE CORE OF ITS ROLE AS A TRUSTED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS OF THE SERVICES THAT LIKE REPRODUCTIVE CARE GENDER AFFIRMING CARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE AT THE I. CARE WITHOUT HERE AND HAVING THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION EXPOSED. SOME PATIENTS SEEK CARE THEY MAY NOT REALIZE THAT INFORMATION ABOUT THE CARE THEY RECEIVE MAY BE DISCLOSED BY REACHING NOTICES FROM THEIR HEALTH INSURER. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR MINORS AND YOUNG ADULTS WHO ARE ON THEIR PARENTS PLAN. ANYONE WHO HAS HAD TO NAVIGATE COVERAGE ISSUES WITH OUR HEALTH INSURANCE NO THAT IS NOT A SIMPLE OR EASY PROCESS. MANY OF US CAN RELATE THAT AS TEENAGERS AND YOUNG ADULTS WE HAD NO IDEA WHO ARE HOPING SURE WAS WHAT INFORMATION LED TO THE HEALTH INSURER. LET ALONE KNOW WHAT RIGHT ONE WOULD HAVE UNDER THE LAW OR HER PARENTS PLAN TO REQUEST CONFIDENTIALITY. ASIAN TO RELY ON OTHER PEOPLE FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE COVERAGE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PLAN IN ADVANCE. AND THEN WITH THE HELP OF CONSUMER RIGHTS ADVOCATES AND ATTORNEYS. TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN GET THE MEDICAL CARE THEY NEED CONFIDENTIALLY. AB ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR WILL SHIFT THE DEFAULT POSITION TO THE ONE WHERE PARENTS. PLANNED DIRECT COMMUNICATION FOR THE PATIENT RATHER THAN THE PRIMARY SUBSCRIBER OTHER PLANS. WHEN NOT PATIENT REDUCE EATING CERTAIN SENSITIVE SERVICES. INSTABILITY OF PROTECTING THAT PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY SHOULD NOT LIE WITH THE PATIENT'S REQUEST PROTECTION IN A SYSTEM THAT IS NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE. HEALTH CARE IS PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIALITY IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT ALL PATIENTS CAN CONTINUE TO ACCESS NEEDED SERVICES WITHOUT FEAR OR JUDGMENT FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE DECISIONS. AB ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR WILL ENSURE THAT PATIENTS AND THEIR INFORMATION OUR CAP SPACE. FOR THESE REASONS LANTERN HEAD IS PROUD TO SPONSOR AB ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON THE CELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT WAS- WITNESS. THE SOVIET CASTILLO ESSENTIAL HEALTH ACT ACCESS HELP EXCUSE ME. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS SYLVIA CASTEEL AND I'M THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS ASCENTIAL ACCESS HEALTH. WE PROBABLY SPONSORED SB ONE THIRTY EIGHT A CONFIDENTIAL HEALTH INFORMATION ACT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE GAINED HEALTH COVERAGE UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WE FELT SAFE ENOUGH TO USE THEIR NEW FOUND COVERAGE. ACCESS SENSITIVE SERVICES LIKE MENTAL HEALTH OR SEXUAL HEALTH CARE. UNDER SB ONE THIRTY EIGHT HEALTH PLAN DEPENDENT THANK YOUNG PEOPLE COVERED BY THEIR PARENTS PLAN WOULD HAVE TO BE AWARE THAT THEIR INFORMATION COULD BE DISCLOSED AND THEN TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT. THEMSELVES THE FOURTEENTH WE WORK DIRECTLY WITH PATIENTS TO SUBMIT CONFIDENTIALITY REQUESTS TO HELP THEIR PLANS. BUT THEY HAVE NOT WORKED WELL BECAUSE IT PLACES THE ONUS ON THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND OTHER PATIENTS TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEX WORLD OF INSURANCE OF HEALTH INSURANCE. HERE JUST A FEW OF THE STORIES OF ISSUES AND ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS THAT PATIENTS HAVE ENCOUNTERED MANY YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE CALLED THEIR INSURANCE PLAN DIRECTLY BUT ONLY TO HAVE UNTRAINED STAFF. WHO HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO PROCESS THE PRIVACY REQUEST OR WERE GIVEN INCORRECT INFORMATION ONE PATIENT WAS EVEN TOLD THAT NO SUCH LAW EXISTED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN IN FACT IT ALREADY DID. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN A FEMALE PATIENT WANTED CAMPAIGN BIRTH CONTROL AND FILE THE PRIVACY REQUEST SHE WANTED TO CONFIRM THE REQUEST WAS IN PLACE BEFORE EVEN MAKING THE APPOINTMENT BECAUSE UNDER SB ONE THIRTY EIGHT HEALTH PLANS HAD SEVEN TO FOURTEEN DAYS TO IMPLEMENT THE INFORMATION BLOCK. THE HEALTH PLAN REJECTED THE REQUEST SO SHE CONTACTED US FOR HELP SHE WAITED TO MAKE THE APPOINTMENT UNTIL THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED FOR THE HER PRIVACY WAS PROTECTED WHICH MEANT THAT HE DID NOT RECEIVE THE CARE SHE NEEDED FOR AN ADDITIONAL THREE WEEKS. MANY PATIENTS ARE NOT AWARE THAT THEIR INFORMATION COULD BE DISCLOSED UNTIL THEY'RE ALREADY AT THE HEALTH CENTER THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE PRIVACY REQUEST WILL BE PROCESSED IN TIME TO STOP DISCLOSURE OF THOSE SERVICES ALREADY OPTING. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE RECEIVED TWENTY FIVE REQUESTS FROM PATIENTS SAYING I GOT BIRTH CONTROL FROM MY DOCTOR I DON'T WANT MY PARENTS TO FIND OUT TO THE INSURANCE IN EACH OF THESE CASES ATTORNEYS FROM THE ACLU AND THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW CONTACTED THE HEALTH PLANS TO ENSURE THE INFORMATION BLOCK WITH IN PLACE. TO PREVENT THE MEDICAL CARE FROM BEING DISCLOSED THAT WAS ALREADY OPTIONED- IT SHOULD SPEAK UP OVER THE ACTUALLY OVER THE YEARS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE CONTACTED US ASKING FOR HELP TO GET THROUGH THESE ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS TO PROTECT THEIR INFORMATION IN ABOUT SIXTY OF THESE CASES LEGAL PARTNER STEPPED IN TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES DIRECTLY.

ADDITIONALLY I'M COMMITTED TO WORK ON AND THE ISSUES OUTLINED IN PAGE SEVEN AT THIS MOMENT MOVES ON TO JUDICIARY AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR THEIR- SUPPORT ON THAT. I'M HERE FOR- EATING DISORDERS ARE SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM AFFECTING YOUTH OF ALL RACES AGE AND GENDER ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ARTICLE PUBLISHED. IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE WHICH INCLUDES DATA FROM SIXTY THREE US EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. CONCEPTION OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS LEAD TO TWENTY THREE THOUSAND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS PER YEAR IN THE US. WELL CALIFORNIA'S AT THE CORPORATE WHEN IT COMES TO TAX STATUTES AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING THEIR THREE SUPPLEMENTS. IT DOES NOT CURRENTLY PROHIBIT THE SALE OF WEIGHT LOSS DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS TO MINORS DESPITE THE WELL DOCUMENTED DANGERS OF THESE PRODUCTS. AS WRITTEN AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE WOULD PROTECT MINORS- BY.

AFTERNOON CHAIRPERSON WOULD BITE SEPARATE NAY AN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FORTY ONE. MY AME IS DR J. FROM THE GADA AND I'M A PEDIATRICIAN AND FACULTY MEMBER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. I AM HERE TODAY SUPPORTING ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FORTY ONE AND URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THE U. S. WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENT INDUSTRY GENERATE OVER TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUE. WE HAVE ALL SEEN THE PRODUCT AND LOCAL PHARMACIES. GROCERY STORES AND HEALTH FOOD STORES. WHAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS THAT WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENTS ARE NOT REVIEWED BY THE FDA FOR SAFETY OR EFFECTIVENESS BEFORE THEY ENTER THE MARKET. RESEARCH AFFECTING THE COMPOSITION OF THE SUPPLEMENT I FOUND THAT MANY ARE LACED WITH BANNED SUBSTANCES. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS STIMULANTS STEROIDS AND OTHER TOXIC INGREDIENTS. RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN THE TYPES OF DOCUMENTS THAT POSE SERIOUS HEALTH RISKS TO CONSUMERS. FOR INSTANCE ONE RECENT SCIENTIFIC STUDY FOUND THAT YOU'RE GIVING WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENTS WHAT THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN THOSE USING ORDINARY VITAMINS THE EXPERIENCE OF YOUR MEDICAL HARM INCLUDING HOSPITALIZATION DISABILITY. AND EVEN DEATH. OTHER STUDIES HAVE LINKED WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENTS WITH ORGAN FAILURE HEART ATTACKS STROKES AND DEATH. THE CDC ESTIMATES THAT SUPPLEMENT YOU THE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS EVERY YEAR WHAT THE QUARTER DUE TO WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENT ALONE. THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS RECENTLY ISSUED A REPORT STRONGLY CAUTIONING AGAINST USING THESE PRODUCTS FOR ANY REASON. YOU TO USE OVER THE COUNTER DIET PILLS ARE SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH AN EATING DISORDER THAN NON USERS. AT THE PEDIATRICIAN SPECIALIZING IN ADOLESCENT EATINGDISORDERS I HAVE CARED FOR COUNTLESS YOUTH IN THE BAY AREA. YOUTH WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENTS AND DIET PILLS DEVELOP EATING DISORDERS BECOME CRITICALLY ILL AND REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATION. THE NUMBER OF THE TEENAGER THE HOSPITALIZED FOR EATING DISORDER THAT UCF HAS DOUBLED SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. WE NEED TO GET THESE DANGEROUS PRODUCTS OUT OF THE HANDS OF OUR KIDS. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FORTY ONE GIVE CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ACTION NOW TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. BILL WOULD PREVENT THE SALE OF WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENTS AND OVER THE COUNTER DIET PILL TO MINORS. ADDITIONALLY IT WOULD MOVE THE PRODUCT FROM OPEN SHELVES TO BEHIND THE COUNTER JUST AS WE HAVE DONE WITH OTHER RISKY PRODUCTS LIKE CIGARETTES. I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE. WE MUST ACT NOW TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVE ON TO. OUR NEXT WITNESS OR IS IT JUST. HELLO YES THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRPERSON WHAT VICE CHAIRPERSON MADE HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF HEALTH CARE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY HI MY NAME IS KELSEY LU AND I'M A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD YOUTH FROM DENMARK CALIFORNIA WAY CURRENTLY ATTEND STEINBERG HIGH SCHOOL.

IF HOOKED ON THEIR PRODUCTS THEY WILL HAVE A GUARANTEED MARKET FOR YEARS TO COME THANK YOU LIBERTY EXPLOIT OUR LOW SELF CONFIDENCE AND BODY IMAGE STRUGGLES. MAKING IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES THAT HORRIBLE TEAMS CAN'T HELP BUT TO BELIEVE. ON A DAILY BASIS I'M BOMBARDED WITH ADS ON SOCIAL MEDIA LEARN NEEDED BY THE LATEST WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENTS AND DIET COKE.

THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME AND LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MOVING ON TO- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LOOK AT THE FACT THAT IT'S WITH MILLER FACT IT DOES YET I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN HERBAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION AFTER THAT. AFTER THE NATIONAL TRADED. REPRESENTING MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MEMBER COMPANY. DOING BUSINESS AS THE GROWERS PROCESSORS MANUFACTURERS AND MARKETERS OF HERBS AND HERBAL PRODUCTS. AFTER MISSION IS TO PROMOTE THE RESPONSIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMERCE THE FOCAL PRODUCTS TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS HAVE INFORMED ACCESS TO A WIDE VARIETY SB FIVE OKAY. WELL WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S GOAL AND ADDRESSING THE FEAR AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS EATING DISORDERS AMONG YOU. WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE EIGHTY THIRTEEN FORTY NINE. ALTHOUGH THE BILL IS WELL INTENTIONED THAT WOULD SERVE ONLY TO KEEP GO DIETARY SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS WITHOUT ACTUALLY EDUCATING THE TEAM IN THE HOUSE. THIRTY SUPPLEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO WELL ESTABLISHED DIRECT REGULATION ENFORCEMENT TEAM. THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION HAVE CLEAR AUTHORITY OVER DIETARY SUPPLEMENT. THROUGH THE FEDERAL FOOD DRUG AND COSMETIC ACT ANY FTP ACT. THE ACT HE IS CHARGED WITH INSPECTING MANUFACTURING FACILITIES REVIEWING LABELING AND MONITORING PRODUCT FOR SAFETY WELL THE ATHLETES HE PURSUED TO ACCEPT A FOLLOW AND LEADING ADVERTISING. ALTHOUGH EVEN TO NOTE THAT OVER THE DAY SUPPLEMENT CONTAINING INGREDIENTS CITED BY THE DOCTORS YEAH. SUGGESTS A FEDERAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL ARE FROM FELL BY THE FDA AND ARE THEREFORE ALREADY EVEN THE BOX. IN ADDITION WE QUESTION WHETHER THE THIRTY BY MONSTER INDICATE A COURSE PROBLEM. A REVIEW OF THE REFERENCES THEY PROVIDE SHOWS THAT TO THE THIRTY AND I ACTUALLY. WEIGHT LOSS PRODUCTS MORE PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE FREQUENTLY USED BY TEAMS ARE AT THE LEVEL BEYOND MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDATION. UNFORTUNATELY THE OWNER EXPAND IN THE BILL AND THE BREATH OF THE PRODUCT THE COLORS WILL LEAD TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. IN PUSHING CONSUMERS TO PRODUCT. PURCHASE PRICE FROM GILEAD SELLERS AND ONLINE MARKETPLACES. WHEN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE I'M DAVE ADULTERATED PRODUCT MAY BE SOLD. FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE WE I DO APPRECIATE AFTER MEETING WITH THAT AND WE ARE COMMITTEDTO AN ONGOING DIALOGUE- WITH HER OFFICE SHOULD THE BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR COMMENTING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I BELIEVE WE HAVE A SECOND WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBER DANTE STAMP THEM ASAP AND ADVISERS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNCIL FOR RESPONSIBLE NUTRITION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE. BY WAY OF BE BRIEF BACKGROUND HERE AND IS THE LEADING TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING DIETARY SUPPLEMENT AND FUNCTIONAL FOOD MANUFACTURERS AND INGREDIENT SUPPLIERS. LIKE THE DARK BY THINKING THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR MEETING WITH US PRIOR TO THIS HEARING TO HEAR OUR CONCERNS WE FELT LIKE THE MEETING WAS PRODUCTIVE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED DIALOGUE. HERE AND ALIGNED WITH POSITION WITH THAT STATED BY LITERACY IS THAT IT IS ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN HERBAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION AND WE ONLY AT THE KEY POINTS. FIRST THERE ARE UNFORTUNATELY SOME BAD ACTORS OUT THERE WHO PURPORTS TO SELL DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS FOR WEIGHT LOSS. BUT WITH DECEPTIVELY AND ILLEGALLY TAINTED THOSE PRODUCTS WITH UNAPPROVED PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS. TO BE CLEAR THE INCLUSION OF SUCH INGREDIENTS NO LONGER MAKE THE PRODUCT OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENT BY DEFINITION RATHER IT IS IN A LEGAL PRODUCT THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN SOLD OR MARKETED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE FDA HAS WORK TO TAKE THESE PRODUCTS OFF THE SHELVES BUT WITH LIMITED RESOURCES WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE STILL OUT THERE. HERE IN SUPPORT FOR THE CRACKING DOWN ON THE ACTORS TO ENSURE THE TAINTED PRODUCTS NEVER MAKE IT INTO THE HANDS OF MINOR. OR ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER. I CAN BETTER ALSO WITH. BOB AT OUT THERE TO SELL WOULD GET HIM A DIED. FAT WHICH USED. AND ONE FIVE THE WRECK. DOSAGE STATE AND EFFECTIVE. WE BELIEVE THOSE FACTORS SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SELL THESE PRODUCTS RESPONSIBLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. THE EXTENT REASONABLE MIND MIGHT DISAGREE ON THE UTILITY OF THESE PRODUCTS. WHAT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IS THAT PRODUCT BANDIT THE HARSHEST FORM A PRODUCT REGULATION AND SHOULD THEREFORE BE AFFIRMATIVELY SUPPORTED BY AT THE- IN THIS CASE THE EVIDENCE SHOULD SHOW CORRELATION BETWEEN THESE PRODUCTS ANY DISORDER. OR BODY DYSMORPHIC DISORDER AT BIRTH DEFECT BUT IT'S NOTED WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE SAUDIS TO WHICH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SITES ARE FACTUALLY FOR THE LEGISLATION COULD NOT SHOW SUCH A CORRELATION. SPECIFICALLY ONE ARTICLES FOCUSED ON BODYBUILDING IT DOES NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENT. ANOTHER STUDY DID NOT ATTEMPT TO FIND A CORRELATION BETWEEN SUPPLEMENT USE AND EATING DISORDERS. AND ANOTHER IS A CASE STUDY MEANING IT ONLY HAPPENED TO ONE PERSON REGARDING THE USE OF BODY BUILDING PRODUCTS. THIRD AND FINALLY IN LIGHT OF EVERYTHING I'VE MENTIONED WE DO BELIEVE. THAT WITH MORE WORK IN DIALOGUE THERE IS A WAY TO THREAD THE NEEDLE TO FURTHER SEPARATE THE GOOD ACTORS FROM THE BAD ONES WITHOUT IMPOSING A PRODUCT FAN. FOR THAT THAN THE OTHER AND IT'S COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA ON A PATH FORWARD. AND TO FURTHER ASSIST IN HER EFFORTS TO COMBAT BUT SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM WITH EATING DISORDERS AND BODY DYSMORPHIA MCCARTY. THANK YOU.

THERMOGENIC WITHIN THAT PARTICULAR PRODUCT THAT UNDER THIS PARTICULAR BILL WOULD BE BANNED OR HADLEY WRITTEN REMOVED FROM THE SHELF AND PLACED UNDER LOCK AND KEY. SO I DO THINK THIS BILL HAS MERIT- THERE IS SOME REALLY REALLY AGGRESSIVE DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS OUT THERE THAT SHOULD NOT BE IN OUR KIDS HANDS I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT. I WOULD JUST LOVE TO DEFINE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE NARROWLY AND I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT AND- I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE THIS CONVERSATION BUT- APPRECIATED BRING THIS FORWARD I AM GONNA LAY OFF OF IT BECAUSE I DO THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO BROAD. THANK YOU. MISS AGUIAR-CURRY YES THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD YOU KNOW THE PANDEMIC REALLY LOT OF THINGS CAME TO THE SURFACE. ONE OF THE THINGS IS THESE YOUNG MEN- YOUNG. BOYS AND GIRLS- ONLINE AND BUYING THESE DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. AND IF YOU HAVEN'T SAT AROUND A TABLE WITH SOME TEENAGERS RECENTLY- BATEI STORIES ABOUT HOW THEIR- OF FRIENDS ARE USING THESE. AND THE FEAR THAT THE FAMILIES HAVE. AND SO- IT'S A I THINK A VERY TIMELY.

PARAMEDICS OFFER OPERATE IN A VERY STRESSFUL AND UNPREDICTABLE ENVIRONMENT AND THEY OPERATE UNDER A VERY STRICT SCOPE OF PRACTICE AND MUST FOLLOW CLEARLY ARTICULATED PROTOCOLS WHEN PERFORMING PATIENT ASSESSMENTS IN RENDERING CARE IN THE FIELD. AND UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES SOMETIMES MISTAKES ARE MADE THAT IS WHY IT'S CALLED PRACTICING MEDICINE. AND YOU IDENTIFY PROBLEMS WHEN YOU IDENTIFY PROBLEMS FOR CONDUCT IT COULD BE A TRAINING ISSUE THE RESULT OF BURN OUT COULD BE A MORE SERIOUS ISSUE ALL REQUIRES WITH MEASURED REVIEW AN INTERVENTION. AND DESPITE THE FACT DIFFERENT PROFIT AGAINST A PARAMEDIC TAKE YEARS TO RESOLVE THIS OP AND BEGINS WITH AN INVESTIGATION AND ACTION TAKEN BY THE EMPLOYER- WHICH FREQUENTLY THE FIRST TO BE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND THEY INTERVENE WITH DISCIPLINE OR TRAINING AS APPROPRIATE. HOWEVER THE CASE CAN INTENTIONALLY MOVE UP TO THE STATE LEVEL WHERE ANSWER MADE- RELEGATE THE SAME CONDUCT IMPOSED DISCIPLINE ONCE AGAIN OFTEN WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF ANY REMEDIATION- REMEDIATING ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE EMPLOYER OR EVEN- PROPOSED RULING PERMITTED.

FOUND THAT CASE BROUGHT BY MS THAT DID NOT HAVE MERIT. FOR THE PROPOSED DISCIPLINE AND ONCE AGAIN THAT RECOMMENDATION BY THE ALJ WAS TO SATISFY- THE FINDING WHICH WOULD STRIP THE MEDIC OF HIS LIFE IN. AN APARTMENT- APPEAL TO A SUPERIOR THE- ALSO FOUND THAT MS COULD NOT FIFTY THE CHAR AND- IT BACK. SIX YEARS SIX YEARS INTO THE PROCESS THE PARAMEDIC IS YET AGAIN IN FRONT OF AN ALE J. FOR A NEW A NEW L. J. FOR ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION. THIS ISN'T FAIR IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT AFTER SIX YEARS- ONE OF OUR- FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDICS WOULD ONCE AGAIN HAVE THEIR LIVELIHOODS IN THE HANDS OF ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO SO CLOSELY TIED TO THE INVESTIGATION. AND THE OUTCOME WE'RE ASKING FOR A NEUTRAL CLEARLY DEFINED DISCIPLINARY PROCESS THAT ALLOWS FOR LICENSEES TO UNDERTAKE WITH CONFIDENCE.

WE HAVE MR LEVINE WAS WAS HERE FOR QUITE AWHILE AND I THINK HE GAVE UP ON THIS BUT I'M PRETTY SURE HE'LL BE BACK. OKAY. SHOULD I BEGIN WITH- ITEM NUMBER. TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY SEVEN FIFTY TWO PLEASE. K. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. LET ME BEGIN BY FIRST OF ALL ACCEPTING THE- COMMITTEES- CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS- CURRENTLY MANY PATIENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE NOT GIVEN CLEAR INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE PROVIDES INSTEAD THEY ARE FORCED TO FIND OUT ISSUES WITH COST AND PRESCRIPTION ALTERNATIVES AT THEPHARMACY COUNTER. THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY CAUSES MANY CHALLENGES TO BOTH THE CONSUMER THE PATIENT AND THE PROVIDER WHEN PATIENTS AREN'T GIVEN THE FULL PICTURE OF WHAT THEIR BENEFITS PROVIDE THEY'RE OFTEN LEFT PAYING HIGHER OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES THAN THAN EXPECTED THAT OFTENTIMES THEY CAN'T AFFORD THIS LEADS TO MANY CHALLENGES MORE SPECIALLY THE PATIENT UNDER MEDICATING UNDER MEDICATED PATIENTS OFTEN HAVE A HIGHER RISK OF A COMPROMISED IMMUNE SYSTEM. AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO CATCH A VIRUSES SUCH AS COVERT NINETEEN. THAT IS WHY I'VE INTRODUCED AB SEVEN FIFTY TWO BECAUSE THIS BILL WILL AUTHORIZE HEALTH PLANS TO FURNISH SPECIFIED INFORMATION ABOUT A PRESCRIPTION DRUG UPON REQUEST. BY AN ENROLLEE OR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER USE IT UTILIZING CURRENT AND AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR MANY PATIENTS HAVING THE OPTION TO KNOW THEIR COST OPTIONS AND ALTERNATIVES EARLIER IN THE TREATMENT PROCESS IS A SERIOUS GAME CHANGE. BECAUSE IT PROVIDES THEM OPTIONS. FOR SOME FOR SOME AS THE OPTION OF SIMPLY BEING ABLE TO ASK THE QUESTION WHILE THEY ARE IN THEIR DOCTORS PRESENTS FOR OTHERS IT'S BEING ABLE TO ENGAGE THEIR PROVIDER ABOUT ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS POTENTIALLY COVERED BY THEIR INSURANCE. WITH SOMEONE THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIP WITH FOR CLARIFICATION. THE DATA AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A. B. SEVEN FIFTY TWO ALREADY EXIST THIS BILL ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT CREATE A NEW SEPARATE SYSTEM AND IT DOES NOT MANDATE DOCTORS TO USE A PARTICULAR SYSTEM. THIS BILL SIMPLY GIVES THE PATIENT AND THE PROVIDER THE ABILITY TO PROCESS THE TO ACCESS INFORMATION THROUGH THE INTERMEDIARY OF THEIR CHOICE A REQUIREMENT THAT IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH RECENTLY PASSED FEDERAL REGULATION. REQUIRING PLANS TO GIVE PATIENTS ACCESS TO THEIR INFORMATION. BY ADDRESSING THE LACK OF GLOBAL PATIENT SPECIFIC INFORMATION SHARING. AB SEVEN FIFTY TWO EMPOWERS PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS TO HAVE REAL TIME ACCESS TO PATIENT SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY BENEFITS AND COVERAGE INFORMATION AND IN THE PROCESS SAVES THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR AND WASTED ON OUT DATED HIGHLY BURDENSOME TASKS THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE AUTOMATED. I'M JOINED BY- PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION LIZ HELMS AND TIM MADDEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA RHEUMATOLOGY ALLIANCE. I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK IS THERE IN THE WE'LL GO TO- YOUR WITNESSES. IS IT GOING TO BE MRS HOLMES WAS THAT MRS HOLMES WAS GONNA BE FIRST MISS HELMS AND- TWO MEN OKAY MRS HOLMES. THANK YOU. WILL YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU'RE READY. YES READY. HELLO THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WORD I DON'T REMEMBER THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY MY NAME IS WITH HIM I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT CHECK POLLUTION OR FORESEES WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONSOR EIGHTY SEVEN FIVE TWO THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING YOU THE FOURTEENTH THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS OUR VIEWS ON THE PATIENT CHOICE AND TRANSPARENCY ACT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK MY NUMBER IS AREA OFFERING CHARCOAL AUTHORS ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MARIE WALDRON ROB BONTA AND SENATOR SCOTT WIENER THE FOURTEENTH OF THE COALITION OF MORE THAN THIRTY LEADING STATEWIDE CONSUMER HEALTH ORGANIZATION WILL. PROVIDE A GROUP THAT PROMOTES A COLLABORATIVE WORKING POLICYMAKERS INDUSTRY LEADERS PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS EIGHTY SEVEN FIVE CHIU ABLE DECISION MAKING TOWARD HER WORK SHOULD BETWEEN A PATIENT AND THE PHYSICIAN PATIENT WOULD BE CENTRAL ACTIVE STAKEHOLDERS IN THEIR ONLY I WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO STICK WITH THEIR TREATMENT PLAN THIS BILL IS CRITICAL AND FINALLY SHE GAVE UP TIME CONSUMING AND FRUSTRATING PROCESS WITH THAT WAY ON PATIENTS. AND THEIR PROVIDERS. ABOUT THEIR HEALTHCARE GREAT WHAT CAN. YEAH OFTEN THE HIM FOR IS ABOUT UNTIL AFTER THEY WERE BARBECUE COUNTER WITH A NEIGHBOR WHICH LOCAL PART OF AND THEY GAVE THEM. THEM ALTOGETHER. WE HEAR ABOUT THEIR ALL THE TIME. SO CARE ONLY WITH PATIENTS STATE OF BUT ALSO WE CAN CREATE YOUR LOSING IS A MORE COST HEALTHCARE FOR THEIR OUT. FORTY BILLION BY FREEING UP EXISTING DRUG DATA FOR PATIENTS WHILE REDUCING STRAIN ON PHARMACISTS AND PHYSICIANS. ACCORDING TO THE COVER MINUS TWENTY TWENTY ONE MEDICATION ACCESS REPORT UP A PRESCRIPTION TO FIND A CLOCK MORE THAN EXPECTED. IN THEIR REPORT 82% OF PROVIDERS LOOK VERY WHAT ARE AUTHORIZATION A TIME CONSUMING PART OF THEIR DAY AND THAT SUCH THERE ARE YEARS TAKE AWAY FROM HAVING FONG RENEWABLE YOU'RE ACTUALLY. WITH PATIENTS.

ENSURE DECISION MAKING HAPPENING HELLO THE PROGRAM NINETY THE TWENTY PROVIDER AND PATIENT RANGERS TV OF THE WELFARE BURDEN UPON PROVIDERS. INCREASE IN HERE STOCKBROKER MEDICATION AND IMPROVE QUALITY AND ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS DIVISION. IN ADDITION BUT NOT MANY REASONS DALY STATED WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING THE PARTIES. CARE ACT ARGUES TODAY. THANK YOU MRS HOW IN THEN WE'LL MOVE TO THE SIDE WITNESS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND TEN BATON WITH THE CAL RHEUMATOL ALLIANCE REPRESENT REMOTE TO THROUGH K. CAN WITH ROOM. I'VE BEEN ONE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THEY FACE WITH HER PATIENCE IS THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY INTO THE PATIENT'S HEALTH INSURANCE AND UNDERSTAND THE DETAILS OF THE PATIENT'S DRUG BENEFITS. WHEN RHEUMATOLOGISTS ARE DEVELOPING A CARE PLAN FOR THEIR PATIENTS CHRONIC DISEASE THE UNDERSTAND CAUSES AN ISSUE. AND TRY TO INCORPORATE THIS ASPECT INTO THE DECISION ON WHAT MEDICATION TO PRESCRIBE THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY INTO THE DETAILS OF THE PATIENT'S DRUG BENEFITS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS INCLUDING. NOT KNOWING WHAT DRUG IS NOT A GIVEN HEALTH PLAN OR HEALTH INSURER'S FORMULARY FOR THE SPECIFIC PATIENT AND THEIR COVERAGE. WHETHER THE DRUG IS SUBJECT TO STEP THERAPY OR OTHER PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS. WHAT ARE THE PATIENTS RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ANY OUT OF POCKET COSTS SUCH AS DEDUCTIBLES AND CO PAYS. EACH HEALTH PLAN AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY HAS THEIR OWN PORTAL PROVIDING DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION MANY TIMES NOT SPECIFIC TO THE PATIENT COVERAGE AND DRUG BENEFITS. NOT KNOWING THIS INFORMATION CREATES ISSUES WHEN THE PATIENT GOES TO THE PHARMACY TO GET A PRESCRIPTION FILLED. AT THE PHARMACY THE PATIENT LEARNS THEY HAVE LARGE OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES THEY CAN'T AFFORD. SOMETIMES THE PHARMACY WILL CALL THE RHEUMATOLOGIST AND LOOK INTO PRESCRIBE A DIFFERENT MEDICATION BUT MOST TIMES PATIENTS SIMPLY DO NOT FILL THE PRESCRIPTION. THE PATIENT THEN RETURNS TO THE RHEUMATOLOGIST FOR THE NORMAL CHECK IN ONLY TO TELL THEM THAT THEY NEVER FILL THE PRESCRIPTION AND THE CONDITION WORSENED. THE RHEUMATOLOGIST THEN HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS HOPING THE NEW MEDICATION THEY PRESCRIBED IS ONE THE PATIENT CAN AFFORD. EIGHTY SEVEN FIFTY TWO WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS HELP RHEUMATOLOGISTS. UNDERSTANDING THE PATIENT SPECIFIC INFORMATION THROUGH ONE PORTAL THAT CAN BE UTILIZED IN THE RHEUMATOLOGIST WORK FLOW SYSTEMS WILL INCREASE THE PATIENT'S ABILITY TO START THE TREATMENT THEY'VE BEEN PRESCRIBED. THIS PROVIDES MORE INSURANCES. THE PATIENT WILL BE ADHERENT IMPROVES THE PATIENT PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIP. MOST IMPORTANTLY A FULLY INFORMED PRESCRIPTION PROVIDES GREATER CONFIDENCE THE PATIENT WILL PICK UP THEIR MEDICATION AND BE IT HERE AND TO THE PRESCRIBED THERAPY. THAT MEANS THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE IMPROVED HEALTH AND HAVE A BETTER OUTLOOK ON THEIR LIVELIHOOD. THE PATIENTS INTERESTING CARE ARE THE FIRST CONCERN FROM A COLLEGES. THE ISSUES OUTLINED ALSO CREATED UNNECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON RHEUMATOLOGIST IN THEIR PRACTICE WHICH TAKES VALUABLE TIME AWAY FROM SEEING PATIENTS. IN FOR PRESCRIBING CAN REDUCE CALL BACKS FROM THE PHARMACY RELATED TO THIS PRESCRIPTION REJECTION BY THE PATIENT. AS WELL AS REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CALLS INTERACTIONS AND TIME SPENT WITH HEALTH PLANS AND HEALTH INSURERS. THIS TIME COULD IN TURN BE USED TO SEE MORE PATIENTS. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH- ARE THERE ANY- WITNESSES. RIGHT TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. MORE TIME ON AB SEVEN FIFTY TWO FILE ITEM TWENTY FOUR OTHER ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

EIGHT ZERO YOU HAVE EIGHT VOTES BELIEVE THE ROLE OPEN BUT THE BILLS OUT OF COMMITTEE PLEASE GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO SINCE YOU'RE HERE. OF I. EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY FIVE PLEASE WHILE YOU'RE THERE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER CHAIR AB EIGHT THIRTY FIVE REQUIRES HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS TO OFFER AN HIV TEST TO ANY PATIENT FOR WHOM A BLOOD DRAW IS ALREADY BEING DONE. IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE ANY BURDEN. ON THE E. D. ON THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT THE BILL WOULD FURTHER EXEMPT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS FROM EXISTING LAW REGARDING HIV TESTING SUCH AS PRETEST COUNSELING AND POST TEST COUNSELLING. AND EXCLUDES PATIENTS IN A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION. THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS THE EASY TO USE RAPID HIV TESTING OR HOME TEST KITS. DESPITE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH HIV OR WITH NEW HIV DIAGNOSES THE STATE STILL HAS MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV AND IS EXPERIENCING FORTY FOUR HUNDRED NEW DIAGNOSIS EVERY YEAR. WE HAVE BEEN LARGELY SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING PEOPLE WHO HAVE RISK FACTORS SCREENING THEM AND GETTING THEM INTO CARE AND TREATMENT IF NECESSARY. IT IS THE CARE AND TREATMENT INCLUDING EFFECTIVE DRUG TREATMENT REGIMENS THAT HAVE PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV WELL INTO THEIR SENIOR YEARS AND BEING PRODUCTIVE HEALTHY MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. HOWEVER WE HAVE NOT BEEN AS SUCCESSFUL WITH PEOPLE WHO DO NOT USUALLY ENGAGE- I'M SORRY WHO WHO DO NOT USUALLY ENGAGE IN IT WHO USUALLY ENGAGE IN RISKY BEHAVIORS ARE IN DENIAL ABOUT THEIR RISKY BEHAVIORS OR UNAWARE. OF THEIR RISK OF EXPOSURE BY A PARTNER. LARGELY THAT IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO SEE SO MANY NEW INFECTIONS EACH YEAR. MAGNIFYING THE PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT ACCORDING TO THE CDC. COLLEAGUES 15% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNAWARE OF THEIR HIV POSITIVE STATUS ARE RESPONSIBLE ME JUST REPEAT THAT AGAIN BECAUSE THAT'S KID CRITICAL HERE. ACCORDING TO CDC 15% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNAWARE OF THEIR HIV POSITIVE STATUS ARE RESPONSIBLE 440% OF THE NEW INFECTIONS OF THAT. 15% 45% OF THEM ALMOST HALF OF THAT POPULATION FALLS WITHIN THE THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR AGE RANGE. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ARE THE LAST MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR HIV TESTING DOES NOT ROUTINELY OCCUR THE CDC AND A CALLED ON ROUTINE HIV TESTING IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS MORE THAN THREE DECADES AGO. IN THE REPORT ON THE- EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT HIV TESTING PILOT PROGRAM CREATED BY AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY NINE- AUTHORED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN- THE TO RESPOND TO THE SHORTAGE OF HIV TESTING PROGRAMS IN THE STATE'S EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AS ENACTED THE BILL CREATED A PILOT PROGRAM SO THAT THE STATE COULD BETTER UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF TESTING THAT IS OCCURRING. IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND EFFECTIVE PROTOCOLS THAT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN EMPLOYING IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH RELEASED THE RESULTS OF ITS PILOT PROGRAM THAT REAFFIRMED THE VALUE OF ROUTINE HIV TESTING IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. EVEN THE EDUCATIONAL AFFILIATE OF THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION PROFESSES THE VALUE OF ROUTINE HIV TESTING AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS- COLLEAGUES JUST SO YOU KNOW BY THE WAY. AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY NINE ESTABLISHED SIX PILOT PRO TO PROJECTS. SEVENTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE TESTED BECAUSE OF THAT BILL. ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY PEOPLE HAD POSITIVE HIV CASES WHO WERE NOT AWARE WHICH YIELDED A ONE POINT TWO PEOPLE OUT OF EVERY HUNDRED THAT SHOWED UP TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IN THIS AGE RANGE DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY WERE HIV POSITIVE AND THEY GO ON TO IN FACT FORTY PERCENT. MORE PEOPLE- WITH THAT I BELIEVE I'M JOINED BY RAND MARTIN- AND- WITH THE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN CONTINUING THIS WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR ASSYRIAN IN THE GALLERY MISTER MARTIN PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. BY. NO. RANDY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION- APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS MISTER NAZARIAN JUST PROVIDED A GOOD SUMMARY OF THE BILL- I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S LONG ACCEPTED IN PUBLIC HEALTH THAT JUST GETTING A TEST RESULT JUST KNOWING YOUR HIV STATUS CHANGES BEHAVIORS COMPELS PEOPLE TO GET INTO CARE AND TREATMENT EVEN WITHOUT ALL THE COUNSELING AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH. SO IT'S PARAMOUNT TO GET PEOPLE INTO TESTING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HF HAS BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS JUST TRYING TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS GET ROUTINE PAP TESTING HAPPENING IN MORE LOCATIONS SO WE HAVE CHANGED THE TESTING PROCESS BY LAW WE HAVE MORE TESTING GOING ON IN PUBLIC HEALTH CLINICS WE HAVE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE NOW REQUIRED TO PAY FOR HIV TESTING IN EMERGENCY ROOMS ALL WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING- ART HIV TESTING IN CALIFORNIA. THE LAST THE LAST PLACE THAT A JOB IS REALLY PUSHING TO GET HIV TESTING MORE ROUTINE IS IN THE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR THE REASONS THAT-MISTER NAZARIAN HAS ALREADY DESCRIBED- BUT THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE OF THE ER AS A AS A GOOD PLACE FOR HIV TESTING GOES BACK TO THE MID NINETIES WHEN THE CDC FIRST ANNOUNCED THAT THIS WAS A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE SHOULD BE GETTING GETTING- GETTING TESTED WE DO RECOGNIZE THE COMPLICATIONS OF ANY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT THE CAPACITY OF STAFF THERE TO DO THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO DO. WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE FOR AN URGENT REASON SO WE HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF AMENDMENTS MET THEM WE THANK MORE THAN HALFWAY TO TRYING GET TO MAKE IT EASIER ON THEM TO ACTUALLY FACILITATE- THIS OF THIS POLICY OBJECTIVE BUT AT AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE OBJECTIVE NEEDS TO BE MET WITH A ONE POINT 7% POSITIVITY RIGHT OUT OF THAT PILOT PROJECT MEANS THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KNOW THEIR HIV POSITIVE. WHO CAN BE CAPTURED. IN IN THAT PROCESS AND CAN- CAN TRY AROUND WELL HEALTHCARE. AND PROTECT PEOPLE THAT THEY INTERACT WITH. I WANT TO CLOSE MY SIMPLY QUOTING. FROM THE STUDY THAT MISTER NAZARIAN REFERENCED IN WHICH THEY SAID. BECAUSE HIV INFECTED PATIENTS VISIT THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. AT MORE THAN TWICE THE RATE OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. AND THEY MAY. SERVE AS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF CARE FOR MARGINALIZED INDIVIDUALS MOST AT RISK FOR HIV INFECTION. THE ROUTINE OFFERING OF AN HIV TEST IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OF A HOSPITAL CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO DIAGNOSE LINK AND RE ENGAGE PATIENTS AND CARE WE ASK YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- GO TO THE PHONE LINES NOW- I BELIEVE WE HAVE A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. YES THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS TIM MADDEN REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON AB EIGHT THIRTY FIVE. FIRST OF ALL WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR FOR THEIR TIME AND EFFORTS TO ADDRESS OUR ON GOING CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A SPONSOR ON THIS ISSUE SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. ARE THE AUTHOR INTRODUCED LEGISLATION AS HE MENTIONED WHICH EVENTUALLY LED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLISHING REPORT ABOUT HIV TESTING IN THE MARKET IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. OUR CONCERNS IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ARE THE SAME AS THEY ARE TODAY. MANY OF OUR CONCERNS WERE IDENTIFIED AS BARRIERS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THREE HEALTH REPORT WHICH EXAMINED HOSPITALS THAT VOLUNTARILY IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM TO OFFER HIV TESTING. IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. WELL THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE AB THIRTY FIVE IMPROVE THE CONSENT PROCESS THERE ARE STILL A CONVERSATION REQUIRED. BETWEEN THE PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT THAT IS BOTH TIME CONSUMING AND POTENTIALLY MISSED TIME. PATIENTS WHO WERE IN THE MERCY DEPARTMENT WITH SERIOUS CONCERNS ARE LIKELY AFRAID. AND ARE NOT IN THE FRAME OF MIND TO BE DISCUSSING HIV TEST. THEY MAY BE UPSET WITH THE TREATING PHYSICIAN FOR DISCUSSING PERFORMING AN HIV TEST WHEN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR SYMPTOMS LEADING TO LONGER CONVERSATION. THESE CONVERSATIONS ADD THIS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME TO THE TOTAL TIME THE CARE PROVIDED IN BUSY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. ACCORDING TO THE CDC BLOOD DRAWS ARE PERFORMED ON 42% OF ALL PATIENTS. IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA MERCY DEPARTMENTS TREAT OVER FOURTEEN MILLION PATIENTS PER YEAR. EVEN IF ADDING AN HIV TEST EACH OF THESE ENCOUNTERS ONLY TOOK AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MINUTES. THAT WOULD RESULT IN AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY NINE MILLION MINUTES OF CARE. EACH YEAR THAT EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS-WOULD BE ASKED TO PROVIDE. THERE IS NO WAY TO ABSORB THIS WITHOUT IMPACTING THE TIMELINESS AND QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDED TO ALL PATIENTS. IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REPORT STATES QUOTE. PROGRAM FIFTEEN ABILITY MAY HINGE UPON EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ABILITY TO IDENTIFY HOW TO COVER THE ACTUAL COST OF SCREENING PATIENTS FOR HIV. AB EIGHT THIRTY FIVE DOES NOT ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AND WOULD ADDITIONALLY RESULT IN UNEXPECTED COST UNINSURED PATIENTS. SIMILARLY IT INSURED PATIENTS MAY HAVE A SHARE OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TESTING WHICH WILL LIKELY BE UNKNOWN TO THEM AT THE TIME THE OFFER IS MADE. EMTALA WHICH IS THE LAW THAT REQUIRES THE MERCY DEPARTMENTS TO TREAT ANYONE COMING IN DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE DISCUSSION OF COST OF CARE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. THE REPORT ALSO POINTED OUT ALL THE HOSPITALS WHO WERE IN THE PILOT PROGRAM RECEIVE SOME LEVEL OF EXTERNAL FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PILOT. LASTLY IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE BILL THE SPONSOR RECOGNIZES THERE ARE WHAT THEY CALL ADDITIONAL OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES. BUT STATE THAT THESE OPERATIONAL ISSUES SHOULD NOT GET IN THE WAY OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT THESE OPERATIONAL ISSUES ARE NOT SIMPLY AN ADMINISTRATIVE HASSLE THEY RESULT IN DELAYED CARE FOR OTHER PATIENTS WITH EMERGENCIES. THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS VERSUS PUBLIC HEALTH THIS IS A QUESTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH SCREENING VERSUS HEALTH OF OTHER EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PATIENT. IT'S A DIFFICULT CHOICE BUT WE MUST ADVOCATE FOR THE GREATEST GOOD. FOR THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PATIENTS FOR THESE REASONS REMAIN IN A LOOK AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE TO THE PHONE LINES FOR OTHER FOR PUBLIC COMMENT- AND PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT- POSITION NAME POSITION AND ORGANIZATION ONLY PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISTRUST REITER. AND WE HAVE COME FROM LINE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CON EL GATO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY NURSES ASSOCIATION THERE WAS AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT CALLER PLEASE. AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE ELSE INTO IT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WITH MISTER SMITH YEAH IF I JUST WITH THE WITH THE AUTHOR THE DAUGHTER WANTS TO HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE I. HAVE GOT THE A LETTER HERE FROM. THE EMERGENCY THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS. AND THE POINTS THAT THEY BRING UP IN HERE AND I THINK THEY ADDRESSED THE IN THEIR OPPOSITION SEEM TO BE- THE REAL AND- AND I'M SYMPATHETIC CAN YOU CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT THE IDEA OF CONSENT- THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS. THE COST BENEFIT- OF IT. THANK YOU OR BRINGING THAT UP I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO ADDRESS THAT IN MY CLOSING BECAUSE I DID HERE. MR MADDEN BRING IT UP AND I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. WITH WHAT HE PRESENTED AND I'M HAPPY TO HAVE. MISTER MARTIN ALSO JOIN IN IF I'M MISSPEAK IN OR SAYING ANYTHING THAT'S WRONG BUT FIRST OF ALL. FROM WHAT I RECALL HEARING HE SAID IT TAKES AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MINUTES. COLLEAGUES THIS IS NOT GOING TO TAKE AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MINUTES THIS IS GONNA BE PART OF AN EXISTING BLOODWORK TEST THAT HAPPENS. WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL IS ADMITTED INTO THE ER ROOM. AS I SAID VERY SPECIFICALLY EARLY ON IN IN MY COMMENTS- THIS BILL REQUIRES HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS TO OFFER AN HIV TEST THAT ANY PATIENT FOR WHOM A BLOOD DROP IS ALREADY BEING DONE. SECOND IT REQUIRES A CONSENT SO IF A PATIENT IS IN A LIFE THREATENING CIRCUMSTANCES THEY'VE BEEN ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE THEY WERE IN A- ACCIDENT. DAY CAN'T SPEAK THEY WILL NOT BE ASKED FOR CONSENT THEY WILL JUST NOT BE GIVEN THAT TEST. BECAUSE IT WILL NOT HAPPEN UNLESS THEY CONSCIOUSLY GIVE A VERBAL CONSENT TO THE TEST- TO THIS TESTING WE'VE BEEN AND I DO APPRECIATE MR MADDEN ALSO POINTING OUT THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS SINCE I WAS FIRST ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. THIS IS THIS IS BEEN pTIME. AFTER THE MAGIC JOHNSON GENERATION. OF YOUTH WHO WERE IMPACTED WHEN MAGIC JOHNSON CONTRACTED HIV AND THE WHOLE WORLD BECAME MORE AWARE. OF WHAT HIV DOES EVERYONE TOOK MORE PRECAUTIONS- THE TECHNOLOGY AROUND HEALTH CARE ALSO ADVANCED WE WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH. CARE THAT IS NOW MORE AFFORDABLE- AND ALLOWS PEOPLE TO LIVE LONGER BUT THE REALITY IS WE STILL NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP CATCHING IT EARLY ENOUGH SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE HEALTH ARE NECESSARY SO THAT THERE AREN'T OTHER CONSEQUENCES AS WELL. AS WELL AS A RAPID RAPIDLY GROWING RATE OF INFECTION ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUNGER THE AGE RANGE THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHICH TENDS TO BE MORE PROMISCUOUS. AND ENGAGE IN RISKY BEHAVIOR. SORRY I WENT ON A BIT LONGER THAN WHAT YOUR QUESTION WAS ASKING BUT WAS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT I CAPTURE EVERYTHING. I JUST- THIS IS AN ABOUT AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO ME- I KNOW ALONG WITH MY OTHER COLLEAGUE- FROM THE COACHELLA VALLEY WE'VE- WORKED ON CAMPAIGNS WITH- GET TESTED COACHELLA VALLEY BECAUSE JUST YOUR POINT THE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE TESTED THE DON'T KNOW. THE BETTER OFF- THE TECHNOLOGY THE SCIENCE- IS IT IS GOTTEN IS BECOME AMAZING I THINK OF PREP AND PAT. AND THE EARLIER THAT YOU CATCH IT THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO ARREST IT- IS- IS THERE AND SO- YOUR YOUR DESIRE TO WANT TO WORK IN THE SPACE- I'M- ALSO VERY SYMPATHETIC I JUST I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'VE GOT EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIANS SAYING THAT THIS THIS IS GOING TO CREATE. ISSUES FOR THAT I'M AND I'M TRYING TO SQUARE THE CIRCLE A LITTLE BIT. A LITTLE BIT THERE AND- AND SO YOU KNOW AGAIN I'VE I GUESS I'D WHAT I HEARD FROM YOU IS THAT MAYBE THE EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIANS DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL OR THE OR IS THERE MORE WORK TO BE DONE. A TO BE DONE HERE. I LOOK I'VE MADE MYSELF AVAILABLE I'VE WORKED WITH THEM IN. EVERY TURN. THIS IS. I I'VE DONE NOW WHAT THE FIRST BILL WAS VETOED. AT THE SECOND ONE WAS NARROWLY CRAFTED SO THAT IT WOULD CREATE THE PILOT PROGRAMS THAT ENDED UP RESULTING IN THE STUDY THAT DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE IS A NEED WHEN 2% THERE IS 2% INFECTION RATE. YET WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT FRACTIONS ANYMORE IT'S TO HOLD BODIES BEING INFECTED AND EXT PASSING IT ON TO OTHERS- AND THAT'S WHY WE LOOK. GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF THE STUDY AND WHEN SEVEN OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THIS AND HAVE BEEN STUDY AND BY THE WAY LET'S NOT FORGET SEVENTY THOUSAND WHO GAVE CONSENT. TO BE TESTED. SO IT'S EVEN A SUBSET OF EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN ADMITTED TO THE C. R. ROOMS. UP WHEN YOU HAVE THESE NUMBERS WHICH BY THE WAY THE REASON I'M BRINGING THAT UP IS BECAUSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS. WHO WHO ARE. CONDUCTING AND EXPOSING THEMSELVES TO RISKY BEHAVIOR- ARE PROP PROBABLY IF THEY WERE TESTED MOST OF THOSE I'M BETTING WE'RE NOT WILLING TO BE TESTED. IS THEY DON'T UNFORTUNATELY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME MIGHT BE SO IT FURTHER SKEWS THAT REPORT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THIS NUMBER WOULD HAVE TO WOULD BE EVEN HIGHER. IF EVERYONE WAS EXPECTED TO TEST. SO EIGHT I AM HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE ARM DOCTORS- BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT THIS TO BE A BURDENSOME ISSUE BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A VERY CRITICAL PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE AT STAKE AS WELL STDS HAVE GONE UP. GOING BACK TO THE PREVIOUS POINT I MADE ABOUT THE MAGIC JOHNSON ERA IT SEEMS THAT AFTER TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE MAGIC JOHNSON PHENOMENA. MOST FOLKS STARTED TO WITH AND WITH THE ADVANCEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY I THINK THIS RECENT GENERATION HAS- FORGOTTEN WHAT THE PREVIOUS GENERATION WENT THROUGH AND HOW CAREFUL WE HAD BECOME AND HOW MUCH MORE WILLING WE WERE TO TEST AND MAKE SURE WE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH OUR BODIES- AND IT'S BEING DONE AT THE DETRIMENT OF THIS NEW GENERATION. AND SO WE NEED TO. PUT BACK CERTAIN- TESTING INTO PLACE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE THIS GENERATION. ISN'T LOST IN IN THIS FIGHT AND IF MISTER RAND WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING TO THIS I. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE. I JUST WANT TO MAKE TWO ADDITIONAL POINTS AS FROM POLYMER MISTER NAZARIAN SAID A NUMBER ONE THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE'VE ALREADY BEGUN TALKING WITH CAL A STEP ABOUT AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO WE THINK WE CAN SAVE EVEN MORE TIME OFF THAT- IT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT WE WERE QUANTIFYING THE AMOUNT OF TIME. THE NUMBERS THAT WE WOULD CHALLENGE OF THE NUMBERS THAT THEY'RE USING BECAUSE THEY TALK ABOUT 42% OF EMERGENCY ROOM PATIENTS ARE GETTING A BLOOD DRAW TO BEGIN WITH- BUT THEN THEY USE THEIR CALCULATION AT THE FULL 100% OF PATIENTS TO COME UP WITH THEIR TWENTY EIGHT OR TWENTY NINE MILLION MINUTES AN ADDITIONAL TIME. SO WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS WE TAKE OUT MOST OF THE THINGS THAT TAKE THE TIME- BUT IF THERE ARE MORE THINGS THAT WE CAN TAKE OUT THE TAKE OUT SOME ADDITIONAL TIME WE WILL DO THAT AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THEN MISTER CHIEF YOU DON'T MIND I'D. LIKE TO ADD ONE MORE THING. AGAIN GIVEN THAT THE- TIMES THAT WE'VE WORKED ON THIS BILL. MAKING INTO A PILOT PROJECT AND THEN NOW MOVING FORWARD. IN ALL THOSE TIMES WE ALSO TRY TO CURTAIL THE BURDEN OF HAVING TO HAVE THE KEY OUR DOCTORS BE THE ONES EVEN EITHER COMMUNICATING THE INFORMATION- WE UNDERSTAND THEIR ER ROOM DOCTORS THEY SHOULD AND THEN SPACE. IT'S A VERY CRITICAL ISSUE WHEN YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO SOMEONE WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH WHEN THEY HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE COMING INTO THE HOSPITAL ROOM FOR SOME OTHER REASONS WE'VE GONE OUT OF OUR WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVEN SOME OF THESE NUANCES THEY ARE NOT BURDENED WITH- TO IT AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE- TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION EVEN THE SLIGHTEST NUANCES. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT FOR US TO AT THIS POINT FORWARD MOVE MOVE FORWARD ON. PLEASE GO AHEAD WANT TO STAND ON THIS BECAUSE YOU THIS THE CONTINUAL WORK IN PROGRESS AND BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST A HEARING ON THIS ALL ALL SUPPORTED TODAY KNOWING THAT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER NAZARIAN THE BILL DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION AND I- I UP. UPLOAD YOUR PERSISTENCE AND YOU CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE THAT GOES BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF YOUR- CAREER HERE IN THE IN THE- IN THIS BUILDING- HI. I'M LOOKING FOR A MOTION AND- A MOTION BY MISS BURKE. SECOND BY MISS AGUILAR CURRY. THE MOTION WOULD BE DO PASSED APPROPRIATIONS. WHICH I TO CLOSE. I'VE DONE A LOT OF TALKING RESPECT AS FOR ADULTS.

EIGHT ZERO I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISSED IN THIS AREA. MR LEVINE. YOU HAVE. THIRTEEN AB. SIX GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS EIGHTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES TO CREATE HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE BEST PRACTICES FOR USE BY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES. AND CONGRESS LIVING FACILITIES THAT ARE PROVIDING POST ACUTE CARE DURING A PANDEMIC A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS OR OTHER EMERGENCY THESE GUIDELINES WOULD ADDRESS AT MINIMUM. THE PROVISIONS OF CARE WHEN THERE IS A SURGE IN THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS REQUIRING CARE RESULTING FROM THE EMERGENCY ONE OF POPULATIONS MOST AT RISK OF ILLNESS AND DEATH FROM THE COVE IN NINETEEN. PANDEMIC ARE THOSE LIVING IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AT THE INTERMEDIATE CARE SOLVING CONGREGATE LIVING FACILITIES- THIS BILL WILL APPLY TO THESE INDIVIDUALS OFTEN HAVE UNDERLYING HEALTH ISSUES IN OUR HOUSE IN A WAY THAT INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT KOBE NINETEEN COULD BE TRANSMITTED. AS WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC THESE FACILITIES HAVE STRUGGLED TO HALT THE SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN NO ONE WAS PREPARED FOR THIS A DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS IT WOULD HAVE TO CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES HOWEVER ONE THING WE CAN BE PREPARED FOR THE FUTURE. EIGHTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE THE SAFETY GUIDELINES IN DESCRIPTION OF BEST PRACTICES TO BE CREATED WHILE LEAVING IT UP TO THE PART IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES TO DETERMINE. WHAT THESE GUIDELINES WILL SPECIFICALLY LOOK LIKE THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE A STREAMLINED AND EFFECTIVE WAY TO PROVIDE THESE FACILITIES PRACTICES. TO REDUCE TRANSMISSION OF DISEASES IN FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES OR PANDEMICS THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC PROVED HOW ESSENTIAL IT IS TO HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE. BEFORE WE ARE IN A CRISIS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS PATRICIA MCGINNIS- OF CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM AND REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR OPERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINE FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES PLEASE GO AHEAD AND YOU WONDER OKAY. OKAY MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE ON CAPTAIN JANET ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM FOR A NON PROFIT LONG TERM CARE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT FOR THIRTY SIX YEARS HAS BEEN ADVOCATING TO IMPROVE THE CARE CHOICES AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OLDER ADULTS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IN LONG TERM CARE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE STILL A BASIC. GIVEN WHAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE PAST YEAR WHEN 40% OF CO THE DEATH NATIONALLY WE'RE RESIDENTS AND STAFF IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. AT LEAST NINE THOUSAND OF THOSE DEATHS WERE IN CALIFORNIA HEALTH FACILITIES THE PROVISIONS OF AB SIX HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. MANY OF THESE DEATHS WERE PREVENTABLE HAD FACILITIES IMPROPERLY PREPARED WITH INFECTION CONTROL AND PREVENTION PROTOCOL. ACCORDING TO CMS INFECTION IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF MORBIDITY OR MORTALITY IN OUR NATION'S LONG TERM CARE HEALTH FACILITIES. YET NOT NOT TELL FACILITIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH INFECTION CONTROL WELL BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT RELEASED IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUND THAT MORE THAN 80% OF NURSING HOMES NET NATIONALLY WERE CITED FOR INFECTION PREVENTION DEFICIENCY. FROM TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. ABOUT HALF OF THOSE HAD PERSISTENT PROBLEMS AND WE'RE CITED ACROSS MULTIPLE YEARS. NOT ALWAYS COULDN'T DEAL WITH SEPSIS OUTBREAKS SO THEY CERTAINLY WEREN'T PREPARED FOR A PANDEMIC OF THIS MAGNITUDE. THE LACK OF STAFF. THE LACK OF TESTING PARTICULARLY IN THE EARLY MONTHS THE LACK OF BASIC. NEEDS SUCH AS MAPLIN GARRN AND THEN MOST OF ALL THE INADEQUATE TRAINING ON SEXUAL CONTROLLED PREVENTION PROCEDURES ALL ADDED TO THE TRAGEDIES THAT RESULTED IN CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. TRAGEDY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE REPEATED AGAIN. EIGHTY SIX AT THE VERY NEEDED PROVISIONS FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO PREVENT THIS KIND OF TRAGEDY FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. AND I URGE A YES VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVING ON TO OUR WITH PLEASE. HELLO MY NAME IS REBECCA GONZALEZ AND I REPRESENT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER WE REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY NINE THOUSAND PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE DECREASED FROM ACCREDITED SOCIAL WORK PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING EIGHTY SIX WHICH WOULD TACKLE A PARTICULARLY PERVASIVE PROBLEMS STEMMING FROM THE COVET NINETEEN PANDEMIC WHICH IS THE FOUNDER ABILITY OF RESONANCES SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES AND CONGREGATE LIVING HEALTH FACILITIES. THE COMPANY NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS PROVIDED THE GAPS AND INSUFFICIENCIES THAT'S CONTEMPORARY HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IT IS CLEAR THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR UPDATED GUIDELINES WITH RESPECT TO PANDEMIC PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES OR OTHER EMERGENCIES AND THESE FACILITIES. DURING THE COMING NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE THOUGHT SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR KOBE CASES AND A HUNDRED AND 310-003-0070 SEVEN NURSING HOME RESIDENT DEATHS NATIONWIDE AND IN CALIFORNIA WE HAD NINE THOUSAND AND FIFTY NINE DOUBTS IN THESE FACILITIES- THE RESIDENTS OF THESE FACILITIES NEED SPECIAL ATTENTION FROM THE STATE IN ORDER TO PREVENT DEATH AND FUTURE PANDEMICS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THIS STOP BY REQUIRING THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO COLLABORATE ON HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES AND BEST PRACTICES FOR THESE FACILITIES AND AT A MINIMUM ADDRESS THE PROVISION OF CARE WHEN THERE IS A SURGE IN THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS REQUIRING TREATMENT. WILL HELP TO DECREASE THESE TRAGIC DEATHS IN THE FUTURE WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO INCORPORATE THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC INTO HAND ENHANCE THE RESPONSE CAPACITY OF OUR SYSTEMS OF CARE WHICH ANY S. W. CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR. I. BOATS ON EIGHTY SIX. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU HAVE AB TWO SEVENTY NINE. ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS A PRELIMINARY MATTER- I LIKE TO ACCEPT ALL COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AS WELL AS GIVEN NOTICE OF MY INTENT- WE HAVE COMMUNICATED THIS YEAR STATUS SHERMAN OF OUR INTENT TO AMEND FURTHER AMEND THE BILL TO EXCLUDE THE LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES OPERATED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO AND I ARE HERE TO ASK. FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI TWO SEVEN NINE. TO PROTECT SENIORS LIVING IN NURSING HOMES AND INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES R. I. C. S. DURING THIS COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROHIBIT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND I SEE APPS FROM EVICTING. TRANSFERRING WE'RE CHANGING THE CONDITIONS OF OPERATIONS FOR RESIDENTS WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT FOR MEDICAL NECESSITY DURING THE V. OFFICIALLY DECLARED COBIT NINETEEN STATE OF EMERGENCY PERIOD. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE SIX MONTHS ADVANCE NOTICE OF ANY PROPOSED TERMINATION OF OPERATION TO EVERY RESIDENT FOR UP TO A YEAR AFTER THE STATE OF EMERGENCY PERIOD. THIS BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE NOTICE OF ANY TRANSFER OF ANY INDIVIDUAL TO THE NURSING HOME OR FACILITY. WHO HAS TESTED POSITIVE FOR CARBON NINETEEN. AS WE ALL KNOW SENIORS LIVING IN NURSING HOMES ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE TO COVER NINETEEN. IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE PANDEMIC SENIORS LIVING IN NURSING HOMES ACCOUNTED FOR UP TO HALF. OF ALL DEATHS DUE TO COVER NINETEEN. WE NEED TO PROTECT THESE VULNERABLE SENIORS FROM BEING EVICTED. FROM SUFFERING TRANSFER TRAUMA ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC. PLEASE GIVE THE SENIORS AND THEIR FAMILIES THE PEACE OF MIND KNOWING THAT THEIR HOMES AT THIS STAGE IN THEIR LIVES WILL NOT BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM. DURING THIS PANDEMIC. I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MY JOIN AUTHOR ON THIS BILL ASSEMBLY MEMBER MIGUEL SANTIAGO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SANTIAGO. I THINK YOU'RE A THANK YOU MY COLLEAGUE FROM TORRANCE AND- MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO CALL PERCENT- DURING THIS TIME THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE AND INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BILL PARTICULARLY THE ENTIRE DISTRICT AND TO THE REST OF CALIFORNIA WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR DISTRICT AND WHY THIS IS AN EMERGENCY CALL THE NEEDS. HOW TO REACH THE GOVERNOR'S DESK VERY QUICKLY AND FIND IS BECAUSE WE HAVE CLOSE TO SEVENTY SENIORS WERE BEING KICKED OUT OF THEIR ADDED THEIR RESIDENTS NOW SIMPLY- BECAUSE THE THIS FACILITY WANTS TO DO THIS FOR OTHER MOTIVES AND REASONS. THERE'S NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WAIT TILL AT LEAST THIS CALL THE CRISIS IS OVER KEEP IN MIND THAT THE SENIORS OF JAPANESE AMERICAN SENIORS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THESE COMMUNITIES- THE THING. IT'S THE- OR YOU. SINCE EITHER THEY WERE BORN OR OR- THEY GREW UP OR THE MATURED THEIR BOOK AND IT'S CULTURALLY SENSITIVE- IF YOU COULD SEND IT TO THE SERVICE CULTURALLY SENSITIVE IN A FACILITY THAT'S PROVIDING CARE FOR THEM. WHAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE NEED TO GET THIS DONE BECAUSE THIS IS HAPPENING ACROSS. THE STATE WE'RE SEEING THE POTENTIAL FOR FACILITIES TO REMOVE SENIOR SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER MOTIVE AND THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE US THE ABILITY. TO AT LEAST PREVENT ANY MOVEMENT OF ANY SENIORS. A. N. N. N. INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES- DURING THIS PANDEMIC SO IT'S REALLY NOT AN AGGRESSIVE BUILT A MODEST BILL THAT ALLOWS SENIORS TO STAY WHERE THEY'RE AT. AFTER THAT. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO CO PRESENT. I AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM NOT TORRANCE. AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THE COMMISSION CHAIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH- WITH THAT WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- SO MISTER MODERATOR PLEASE. OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. INTERNET SERVICES. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M MIKE DARK A STAFF ATTORNEY AT CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM A NONPROFIT ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THE ADVOCATES FOR CALIFORNIANS AND LONG TERM CARE. WHEN PEOPLE MOVE INTO NURSING HOMES THEY LEAVE BEHIND FAMILIES. FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS THEIR PLACES OF WORSHIP THEIR PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY. GIVEN UP MOST OF WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO GET THEIR LIVES DIGNITY AND MEANING. OFTEN THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE LEFT IS THE FACILITY THEY LIVE IN THE PEOPLE THEY MEET THERE THE OTHER RESIDENTS THE STAFF. BEING FORCED TO LEAVE A NURSING HOME FOR ANOTHER FACILITY WAS UNIVERSALLY UNDERSTOOD TO BE TRAUMATIC BEFORE COPE WITH IT. WHICH IS WHY BEFORE KOBE. RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN IDENTIFYING ANOTHER FACILITY TO GO TO. A HUGE PROBLEM WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH CODE IT IS THAT RESTRICTIONS ON VISITATION MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE BUT THAT THE NEW FACILITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE CLEAN. AND SAFE AND ADEQUATELY STAFFED BUT THIS BILL ASKED IS TO TEMPORARILY EXTENT OF HONORABLE NURSING HOME IN A FEW UP RESIDENTS THE SAME KINDS OF PROTECTIONS AGAINST DEPICTION OF RESIDENTS OUTSIDE CONGREGATE SETTINGS ARE ALREADY GETTING. INTO MANY STATE AND MUNICIPAL RULES. THE BILL CURRENTLY EXPLICITLY PERMITS TRANSFERS TO GENERAL ACUTE HOSPITALS FOR MEDICAL REASONS WHICH IS APPROPRIATE. BUT IN ITS CURRENT FORM IT WOULD ALSO PERMIT ATTENDING PHYSICIANS CONTRACTING WITH DISABILITIES TO TRANSFER RESIDENTS ON THE NON EMERGENCY BASIS TO OTHER SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. AND ITS A RULE WHICH WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH CURRENT TRANSFER LAWS- AND COULD BE EASILY EXPLOITED CANTOR WOULD RESPECTFULLY URGE THAT THIS ISSUE BE DEALT WITH BY A SIMPLE AMENDMENT- ONE THING THAT DOES STAND OUT ABOUT THE- OPPOSITION LETTERS FILED BY INDUSTRY INTEREST. IS THAT NO ONE IS EVEN DISPUTING THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE RIGHT NOW TWENTY VICTIMS RESIDENT WHETHER FAMILY TO VISIT POTENTIAL ME PERSONALLY TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE APPROPRIATE. AND NOT THE ARGUMENTS THEY DO OFFER IN OPPOSITION ARE COMPELLING THE BILL WOULD NOT KEEP FACILITIES AREIN GENUINE FINANCIAL STRAITS FROM DISTRACTING RESIDENTS. BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT THEY FILE A PETITION. FOR CHAPTER ELEVEN BANKRUPTCY FIRST. OPPOSITION TO THE LAW ME BECAUSE THE BECAUSE TO. SIMPLY MISSES THE POINT BUT CHIEF EXISTING PROTECTIONS LIKE BEING ABLE TO VISIT THE TRANSFEREE FACILITY FIRST HAVE ALREADY BEEN SUSPENDED AS A RESULT. OF CALLED THE DISSERTATION RESTRICTIONS. FINALLY IS ORWELLIAN TO SUGGEST THAT A BILL TEMPORARILY HALTING EVICTIONS OF THE OLD AND THE SIX DURING A PANDEMIC WOULD INTERFERE WITH PATIENT CARE. IT'S NOT A CONCERN FOR PATIENTS BUT DESIRE FOR PROFIT THAT IS DRIVING THE CLOSURE OF FACILITIES. LIKE SAKURA ICE YET LOS ANGELES. WE SHOULD BE ABLE AS A SOCIETY DEALING WITH THE DEVASTATING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. TO DELAYED THAT KIND OF PROFIT TAKING FOR ONLY A SHORT. TIME I HEARD YOUR YES VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- BELIEVE WE HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS. YES PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON TO. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR WOULD AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS CARRIE FORTY YEAR I'M A RESIDENT OF PASADENA CALIFORNIA AND I'M A CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT. I'M SPEAKING TODAY AS THE DAUGHTER OF THE CURRENT STOCK WITHOUT LIFE YES PRESIDENT. THE BILL WILL HELP MY FAMILY AND ALL THE RESIDENTS AFFECTED IDEA. AS WELL AS NURSING HOME RESIDENTS ALL ACROSS THE STATE. MY FATHER IS JAPANESE AMERICAN BORN IN TORRANCE CALIFORNIA NINETY FOUR YEARS AGO TO IMMIGRANT PARENTS FROM JAPAN YEAH LIVED IN THE TORRANCE GARDENA AREA HIS ENTIRE LIFE AND GREW UP IN THE JAPANESE AMERICAN COMMUNITY. FOR GENERATIONS THE JAPANESE COMMUNITY SUPPORTED THESE RETIREMENT AND ASSISTED CARE FACILITIES. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN THEIR RELATIVES NEEDED CULTURALLY SENSITIVE CARE IN THEIR SENIOR YEAR. THE JAPANESE AMERICAN RESIDENTS OF THE FACILITY I SHARED HISTORY DURING WORLD WAR TWO MANY WERE RELOCATED FROM THE HOME AND SENT TO INTERNMENT CAMPS. MY FATHER HIS MOTHER AND MY AUNT OR FORCED TO MOVE INTO THE CAMP. MY GRANDFATHER WAS ACTUALLY ARRESTED BY THE FBI MY FATHER WAS POWERLESS TO STOP THE PROCESS. THE FBI CAME KNOCKING ON THEIR DOOR ON FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH AND TOOK HIM AWAY. THE FAMILY WITHIN FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HOME ON LATER NOT NOT STILL REMEMBERS EATING CHOCOLATE EASTER BUNNY AT THAT TIME. IT SEEMS LIKE THIS TERRIBLE MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY IT HAPPENING AGAIN. AT THAT TIME THEY WERE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR HOME BECAUSE OF FEAR THIS TIME THEY'RE BEING TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE OF GREED. THEY'RE LOSING THEIR HOMES AGAIN THE CLOSURE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PATIENT CARE THE CURRENT OWNERS THE PHYSICAL WANT TO REDEVELOP THE LAND TO BUILD CONDOS. IT ADDS TO THE GENTRIFICATION. OF THE BOYLE HEIGHTS NEIGHBORHOOD. THE RESIDENTS ARE WE- THE FEELING- SHE GOT UP AT NIGHT THE JAPANESE REYES MEANING IT CAN'T BE HELPED OR NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT. I HAVE NOT YET FOUND THE COURAGE TO TELL MY DAD THAT THE FACILITY WILL BE CLOSING. IT WOULD REAWAKEN THOSE FEELINGS OF HELPLESSNESS. IT FELT PREVENT MY FATHER AND ALL OTHER RESIDENTS FROM BEING CAPTAIN TO THE UNCERTAINTY. OF LOCATING VETTING ARRANGEMENTS. WHICH WOULD BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE ARE LESS THAN A DOZEN INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA. AND THIS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CATERS TO THE JAPANESE AMERICAN COMMUNITY. DURING THE PANDEMIC IT IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT TO EVEN LOOK AT OTHER FACILITIES. IF THERE'S A TO QUOTE THE FACILITY FAMILIES WILL HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY FINDING A COMPARABLE FACILITY WITH IDENTICAL AND CULTURALLY SENSITIVE CARE. MY FATHER NEEDS TO IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE CARE AUTHORED BY ORDINARY YOUR HOME WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT. THAT COULD ICF PROVIDES THE PROPER LEVEL OF KERR. PLEASE PASS THE BILL.

OUTLINED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MURATSUCHI AND SANTIAGO AND HAVE APPRECIATED BOTH OF THEM MEETING WITH US AND ARE VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN BE HELPFUL TO THEM- INVOLVING THIS. VERY IMPORTANT DISTRICT ISSUE- UNFORTUNATELY WE MUST OPPOSE AB TWO SEVEN NINE TODAY ON IN ITS CURRENT FORM. BECAUSE THE BILL WOULD NOT JUST APPLY TO THE ONE INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITY THAT'S IN LOS ANGELES BUT WOULD ALSO IMPACT ALL RIGHT YES. IN ALL ELEVEN HUNDRED SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES STATE WIDE. THE BILL WOULD LIMIT ANY CHANGES TO PATIENT SERVICES FACILITY OWNERSHIP OR OTHER STATE APPROVED FACILITY MODIFICATION. THAT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT ACTUALLY BENEFIT PATIENT CARE. AND WE AGREE THAT THEY COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS BEEN DEVASTATING FOR A LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES THE PATIENTS IN THE CARE GIVERS AND- WE AGREE THAT THESE TIMES ARE UNPRECEDENTED- WE ALSO AGREED SUPPORT TO KEEP PATIENTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN THEIR CURRENT FACILITY LOCATION. BUT THE TYPES OF RESTRICTIONS AS OUTLINED IN AB TWO SEVEN NINE HI THE HANDS AT THEIR SIDES OF DROPS DATE THAT ARE MAKING DECISIONS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT SAFETY AND WELL BUILT. WELL BEING. I WE'VE EXPRESSED COULD BE ON ARE AND HAVE PROVIDED AND THEN NOT- THAT WAY. REALLY TRY TO PUT FOR- CREATING SPECIFIC CODE. WE LOVE PLAN RECALL. AND APPROVAL OF THE BILL REAL OKAY.

NOT ONLY PATIENT FURTHER AT RISK BUT PUSH THE STATE INTO ACROSS BANKRUPTCY CROW WITH DEBTORS BEING PAID AND PATIENTS NOT BEING PROPERLY CARED FOR. SO AGAIN WE'RE- VERY MUCH AGREEMENT WITH THE- THAT SITUATION OF MY FINANCIAL COULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED BETTER. AND SHOULD HAVE REQUIRED MORE INVOLVEMENT AND OVERSIGHT BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF UBLIC HEALTH. WE DO HOPE WE CAN ASSIST IN FINDING A SOLUTION TO THAT SITUATION RATHER THAN. CREATED STATE WIDE RESTRICTION AND PACKING OVER. ELEVEN HUNDRED LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND THEY'RE NINETY THOUSAND PATIENTS- THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE TO OPPOSE AB TWO SEVEN NINE- I'M AND I APOLOGIZE FOR CUTTING IN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

FIVE EIGHTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB FIVE EIGHTY SIX WHICH WILL EXPAND SCHOOL BASED HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO STUDENTS. EVEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THE INCIDENCE OF YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WAS INCREASING AT AN ALARMING RATE. AND THE PANDEMIC HAS ONLY EXACERBATED THESE CONDITIONS. SCHOOLS ARE WELL POSITIONED TO MEET THE HEALTH THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF STUDENTS. BUT THEY LACK THE RESOURCES TO DO SO EFFECTIVELY. FOR TOO LONG SCHOOLS OF LACK THE GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT NECESSARY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUNDING AVAILABLE TO MEET STUDENT NEEDS. WE ARE LEAVING FEDERAL MONEY ON THE TABLE CALIFORNIA RECEIVES ONLY TWENTY NINE DOLLARS PER MEDIC CAL ELIGIBLE CHILD. IN REIMBURSEMENTS FOR SCHOOL BASED SERVICES WELL OTHER STATES RECEIVE UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER CHILD. THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A TWO YEAR PILOT PROGRAM. FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO CHOOSE EXPERT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TEAMS. WHO REVISED INTENSIVE SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE TO SELECT LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. THE TEAMS WILL ASSIST THE L. A. AS WITH ACCESSING FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH EXISTING PROGRAMS LIKE THE ELLIE A BILLING OPTION PROGRAM. THEY WILL ALSO ASSIST THE L. A.'S WITH ESTABLISHING PARTNERSHIPS WITH COUNTY HEALTH AGENCIES COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS AND HEALTH PLANS TO MAXIMIZE THE SERVICES AND REVENUES AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH SERVICES. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE TWO YEAR PILOT PROGRAM THE PARTICIPATING ELEAZAR WILL HAVE DEVELOPED A SUSTAINABLE MODEL WITH RELIABLE ON GOING FUNDING FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES TO MEET STUDENTS. THE CD WILL USE LESSONS LEARNED TO DEVELOP RESOURCES AND SUPPORT TO SCALE UP THESE EFFORTS STATEWIDE. IN SHORT MISTER CHAIR THE EFFORT HERE IS TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE STATE AND LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO BILL MEDICAL FOR SERVICES PROVIDED SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE EIGHTY SIX TODAY ARE. ALEX RISK OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S TRUST AND RUBEN REYES SUPERINTENDENT OF THE ROLE OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MODERATOR PLEASE OPEN THE ROLE WHEN THEY- ARE NOT OPEN I MEAN OPEN THE LINES AND LET THE WITNESSES TO TESTIFY. ONE ZERO. I THANK YOU- ALEX BRISCOE PROPOSED THE CALIFORNIA CHOSE TRUST. IT IS MY PLEASURE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF FIVE EIGHTY SIX. I AM. THERE IS LEGITIMATE CRISIS AND THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL AFFECT CHILDREN. IT IS A CRISIS THAT PRECEDED THE PANDEMIC BUT THE CAMPAIGN DEMOCRATS BROUGHT INTO EXTREMELY ACUTE. KNOWLEDGE IN OUR CULTURE AND SOCIETY. CONSIDER THE FACTS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC IN THE DECADE BEFORE COURT NINETEEN. WE SAW STRIKING INCREASES IN UTILIZATION AND ACUITY AMONG CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH. PATTERSON AND SYSTEMS. WE SAW ONE HUNDRED AND 4% INCREASE IN INPATIENT VISITS FOR SUICIDE AND SUICIDAL IDEATION. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. AND WHILE LENGTH OF STAY DECLINED ACROSS OUR STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. ACOSTA ALL THESE BURDENS THEY ACTUALLY INCREASE FOR PAEDIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH BY FIFTY PERCENT. AND CHILDREN THEMSELVES TOLD US IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY. YOU'RE A 61% INCREASE IN SELF REPORTED MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE. IT HAS ONLY EXACERBATED THIS CHALLENGE. IS BROUGHT IN TO CLEAR FOCUS CHALLENGES OF OUR EIGHT. CHILD SUPPORTING SYSTEMS. HAVE ARE FORCED US TO EXAMINE NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN. SHUTTLE INCLUDING RADY CHILDREN'S HOW. AND OPENED SO STRIKING INCREASES ENERGY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS WERE UP BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND 35% FOR ADOLESCENTS AND CHILDREN SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. IT IS NO NEWS- TO ELECTED LEADERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST MEDICAID PROGRAM IS THE LARGEST MEDICAID PROGRAM IN THE NATION. AND UNFORTUNATELY PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN ONE OF THE WORST. WE RANK FORTY FOURTH IN THE NATION ACCESS TO CARE FOR CHILDREN. AND CHILDREN REPRESENTS 42% OF OUR ROLE IS THAT ONLY 14% OF ALL EXPENDITURES. CALIFORNIA IS GROUND ZERO FOR INCOME INEQUALITY WE WILL BE BY THE FALL. WE WILL BE IN A SITUATION WHERE SIX OUT OF TEN CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN THE STATE SIX MILLION CHILDREN WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID. LIVING UNDER 210050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY. LESS THAN 5% OF CHILDREN ENROLLED MEDICAID GET ANY ACCESS AND SUPPORT ALL FROM HOME. SCHOOLS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ANY RESPONSE AT SCALE. THE SYSTEM IS EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX AND SCHOOLS CAN AND MUST BE ESSENTIAL ACTORS. FIRST MS NEED SCHOOLS CHILDREN EIGHT EIGHTEEN HAVE THE LOWEST RATE OF PRIMARY CARE UTILIZATION OF ANY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP AND MEDICAID PROGRAM. SO WHEN THEY NEED TO HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THE MOST THEY CAN'T ACCESS IT. AND ALSO THE FINANCE OF THE LINE. THE CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY HAS THE FOURTH HIGHEST TAX BASE IN THE NATION BUT WE READ THIRTY FOURTH AND SPENDING PER BENEFICIARY TO ALL OF US WHO LIVE HERE ARE ASKING THE SAME QUESTION. HOW DO WE PULL DOWN MORE FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS FOR THE DOLLARS ARE ALREADY SPENDING. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT FIVE A SIX. SPEAKING AFTER ME A SUPERINTENDENT RUBEN RACE OF THE ROAD THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WE WORKED SERVER CANNOT REST ON SOME OF THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT IS CONSECRATE BASIS AND IT'S A PLEASURE AND AUSTIN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MR HI GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM WORKING RIGHT S. AND I'M THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SACRAMENTO. WELL IT'S A SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS SERVING TWENTY TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS IN PRESCHOOL THROUGH GRADE SIX. ARE PART OF THE CITY IS CHARACTERIZED BY A VERY HIGH POVERTY RATE. OUR SENSE OF SECURITY HELD A STEP BETWEEN NINETY AND 95% OF OUR STUDENTS LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. BUT ALSO CALPERS THAT NEARLY A QUARTER OF OUR STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS. THE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THAT SO MANY CHALLENGES CHALLENGES IN THE LIVES OF OUR STUDENTS. CHALLENGES ALL TO CREATE A NUMBER OF OBSTACLES TO LEARNING AND IMPACT GREATLY OUR STUDENTS ABILITY TO WORK WITH OTHERS AT SCHOOL AND TO ENGAGE FULLY IN THE CLASSROOM. BUT I BECAME SUPERINTENDENT IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT WE MUST DEVELOP RESOURCE INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. IN ORDER TO ALLOW OUR STUDENTS TO REACH THEIR POTENTIAL. THESE DAYS OF ALL THE INCREASE OVER THE PAST YEAR DURING THE CUP OF NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WE HAVE SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF EVIDENCE THAT EVEN THE YOUNG STUDENTS WE SERVE IN OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. ARE DEALING WITH ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND I'VE LOST MANY OF THEIR SOCIAL SKILLS DURING THESE MONTHS OF ISOLATION. OVER TIME WE HAVE USED. LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA FIVE. TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS. BUT MAKING STRETCH OUR RESOURCES ONLY SO FAR. AT THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT WE CONTINUE TO SEARCH OUT FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDING REIMBURSEMENTS TO SUPPORT OUR WORK IN THIS AREA. THE MANAGED CARE TO FAMILY TO BURY COMPLEX AND NAVIGATING THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO ACCESS FUNDING. AVAILABLE UNDER THE SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO SAY THE LEAST. REBEL HAS TRIED TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT TO FIFTEEN. WHAT EXAMPLE WOULD BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND THIS HAS RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL COMMISSION AT ONE OF OUR SCHOOLS. BUT WE STILL FALL FAR SHORT OF MEETING OUR STUDENTS NEED. THIS BILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE NEEDED GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT SOME SOME NEEDED BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO ACCESS FUNDING FOR THESE VITAL SERVICES. OUR STUDENTS WELL BEING AND OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY DELIVER INSTRUCTION DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS RESOURCES. ORTEGA'S MENTAL HEALTH WORK. IN THE LONG TERM THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE DO NOT HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION REGISTERED SO WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO THE PHONE LINE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ADD AB ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT WHICH IMPROVES PATIENT PROTECTIONS AND INCREASES CONSUMER CONFIDENCE BY ESTABLISHING MINIMUM INSURANCE COVERAGE STANDARDS FOR LICENSED DRUG ABUSE RECOVERY AND TREATMENT FACILITIES AND RECOVERY RESIDENCES THAT CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT ENTITY. I CURRENTLY THERE IS NO EXISTING STATE LAW THAT REQUIRES A SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FACILITY RECOVERY RESIDENTS TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM INSURANCE COVERAGE LEVELS THE LACK AT THIS REQUIREMENT PUTS PATIENTS AND WORKERS AT RISK. AB ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT AIMS TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND INCREASED STANDARDS PLEASE TO INTRODUCE TODAY FOR SUPPORT TESTIMONY I TO WITNESSES BOB MALLORY MICHAEL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND SHERRY DAILY FROM THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION.

THANK YOU FOR MUCH OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON WHEELCHAIR MEMBER SHERRY DALY WITH CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS REPRESENTING ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY RECOVERY RESIDENCES HERE IN CALIFORNIA I'M HERE TODAY AS AN ENTHUSIASTIC CO SPONSOR OF THE EIGHTY UP TO FIFTY EIGHT TO REQUIRE INSURANCE COVERAGE HE MAINTAINED BY BOTH ENTITIES. CONCERNING TREATMENT PROGRAMS MOST ARE REQUIRED TO KERRY INSURANCE FOR CONTRACTING PURPOSES THE COUNTIES ARE THE FALL SHORT OF THE STATE MANDATE TO DO SO WE'VE BEEN PATIENT VULNERABLE TO FLY BY NIGHT OPERATORS WHO DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN COUNTY CONTRACTS. AND MAKE IT A FIGHT TO OPEN TREATMENT PROGRAM WITHOUT USING PROPER BUSINESS PRACTICES THIS BILL WOULD CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM REGARDING RECOVERY RESIDENCES WERE FAR MORE COMMON FOR OPERATORS TO ATTEMPT TO FLY UNDER THE RADAR. BY PURCHASING HOMEOWNERS OR RENTERS INSURANCE POLICIES WHERE THERE IS NO COMMERCIAL LIABILITY INCLUDED AT ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT WOULD END THE UNETHICAL PRACTICE THE NEED TO HAVE APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF INSURANCE RECOVERY RESIDENCES IS THREEFOLD FIRST IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE RESIDENTS TO BE PROTECTED SHOULD HARM COME TO THEM OTHER PROPERTY. SECOND IN ORDER FOR LANDLORDS TO TRUST OWNERS AND OPERATORS TO USE THE PROPERTIES FOR RECOVERY RESIDENTS OPERATIONS THERE MIGHT BE SOME ASSURANCE THAT IF THERE IS PROPERTY DAMAGE OR ANY SORT OF ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT REQUIRING MEDICAL EXPENSES. THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY WILL NOT BECOME THE DEEP POCKETS AND ANY ENSUING LAWSUIT THIRD AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY ALL RECOVERY RESIDENCES THAT ARE NOT RUN BY THE RESIDENTS EXCLUSIVELY WHICH WOULD BE THE CASE AN OXFORD MODEL HOME. MUSCAT THE LEVELS OF INSURANCE THAT THEY THE BILLS THAT WE DON'T LOSE GOOD OPERATORS WHICH WOULD LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF BEDS AVAILABLE AS AN EXAMPLE LAST YEAR WE HAD AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT AT ONE OF OUR CERTIFIED HOMES WARM ONE WHERE AND ONE RESIDENT ATTACKED ANOTHER. THE OPERATOR OF THE HOME HAVE PROVIDED EXPLODED BY AN EXCELLENT BERMAN FOLLOWED ALL THE GUIDELINES FOR SAFETY OF THE RESIDENTS BECAUSE YOU VOLUNTARILY PURCHASE PROPER LEVELS OF INSURANCE THE VICTIMS COMPENSATED FORCED ENTRY VIA THE INSURANCE PLAN AND THAT PLAN HOME RUN HOMES STILL EXIST TODAY. HAS NOT BEEN FOR THE INSURANCE THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE CRUCIAL NEED. TO SUSTAINING THE HOUSING RESOURCE WHILE RESPECTING THE- DECIDE NOT TO TREAT THESE HOMES. INSTITUTION OR VIOLATE INTO THAT RIGHTS THE REST OF. IT DOES NOT ENCROACH FAIR HOUSING OR- STATUTE SIMPLY SETS THE GROUND RULES FOR TRANSACTION. BETWEEN OWNER ROBERT. AND THEIR INSURE CARRIER. WE RESPECTFULLY DR OUT. THANK VERY MUCH. THIS DOES WE DO SHOW ANY RED OPPOSITE TO THE BILL WERE WITH WITNESSES EXCUSE ME FOR A IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL SO WITH THAT WILL ASK THE OPERATOR TO OPEN THE LINES FOR. PUBLIC COMMENT. PUBLIC COMMENT IS JUST YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISTER OPERATOR. AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. OKAY BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SINCE OUR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I DO I DO HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND- I WILL PERSONALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS TO GET ONGOING EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDED TO SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS BY THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE INDUSTRY. I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO GO WITH THE BILL AND IT HAS MY SUPPORT TODAY OUR FEEL QUITE STRONGLY THAT SOME OF THE POLICY QUESTIONS WE RAISED NEED SERIOUS CONSIDERATION HOPE TO SEE THEM ADDRESSED AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD- THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE SO THAT I CAN CONTINUE SUPPORT AT. THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE IMPACT OF A COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS JUST STARTING TO BE FELT WE HAVEN'T HAD FOR A LONG TIME IT IS INADEQUATE NUMBER OF TREATMENT FACILITIES OUTPATIENT CLINICS RECOVERY RESIDENCES AND S. UT WORKFORCE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT YOUR BILL MAY HAVE MOVING FORWARD. AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES AT THE TIME OF OUR GREATEST NEED I'M ALSO NOT CONVINCED THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT VIOLATE A PROTECTIONS OFFERED TO INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM A DISABILITY UNDER THE FHA AND THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT LIKE OTHER BILLS THAT WE HAVE LOOKED OUT OVER THE YEARS IN THIS IN THIS AREA SO- SO- I'M- I BELIEVE YOUR BILL MAY FACE THIS ISSUE BEFORE THE NEXT COMMITTEE- WHICH IS- THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE. I AM I AM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH EMPOWERING INSURERS THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES ARE COMPLYING WITH THEIR LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE BY STATUTE OVERSEEN. BY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WHAT RECOVERY READ ARE NOT CURRENTLY REGULATED I KNOW THAT'S A HUGE PART OF THE PROBLEM AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT EFFORTS BEEN ABLE BEEN. UNDERTAKEN TO TRY TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. BUT I JUST DON'T SEE THE LOGIC IN HAVING THEM BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH ANY ARE OUR STANDARDS FOR THE PURPOSES OF INSURANCE ONLY- I ALSO HAVE IN THE INSURER IS TOTALLY UNFAMILIAR WITH THOSE STANDARDS. THE SPD INDUSTRY OR HEALTH CARE STANDARDS IN GENERAL DETERMINE IF THEY'RE COMPLIANT. SEEMS AT BEST A STRONG COURSE IN MY OPINION SO- SO. LIKE I SAID I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I STILL BELIEVE THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK. THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE HERE AND WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. WELL I'LL JUST SAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THIS COMMENT AND FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND FOR EVERYTHING THEY THAT YOU IN YOUR COMMITTEE HAVE DONE TO WORK WITH US TO ADVANCE THIS POLICY. YES WE WILL CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO WORK ON. FIVE HUNDRED AND THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN NOT ENOUGH ANALYSIS AND IN THOSE COMMENTS. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. AND WITH THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THREAD THAT NEEDLE PROPERLY. AND THAT WE ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF RAISING STANDARDS OF PATIENT CARE. I IN THE RECOVERY SPACE SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY PHONE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE WE DO HAVE A MOTION BEFORE US THE MOTION.

THIS BILL DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES EXACERBATED BY THE COLD NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THROUGH FOOD PRESCRIPTIONS A MEDICALLY SUPPORTIVE FOOD INTERVENTION. THE GOALS OF AB THREE SIXTY EIGHT ARE BOLD INNOVATIVE AND AMBITIOUS. JUST AS THE HEALTH PROVIDER WOULD WRITE A PRESCRIPTION FOR AN ANTIBIOTIC. FOR AN INFECTION A PRESCRIPTION FOR MEDICALLY SUPPORTED FOOD. CAN HAVE THE SAME POSITIVE HEALTH IMPACTS FOR SOMEONE WITH PREDIABETES DIABETES. OR HYPERTENSION. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION INCREASING ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD. COULD HELP PREVENT MANAGE AND OR MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC DISEASES. AND THE MEDICAID POPULATION THIS TWO YEAR PILOT PROGRAM ADDRESSES UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS AT THE FRONT END. BY PROVIDING HEALTHY FOOD PRESCRIPTIONS AS A MEDICAL INTERVENTION. IN ALAMEDA ST BERNARD YOU KNOW. AND FRESNO COUNTIES. THROUGH THIS PILOT WE CAN GAIN AN INNOVATIVE HEALTHCARE TOOL TO ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES. AND BUILD A HEALTHIER CALIFORNIA.

ONE WAY TO MEET THE MOMENT IS TO USE THE POWER OF FOOD PRESCRIPTIONS TO PREVENT TREAT AND REVERSE CHRONIC DISEASE IN OUR BY POT COMMUNITIES. LET ME SHARE STORY FOR A PATIENT TO HIGHLIGHT OUR MODEL HERE WORKS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. MISTER X. IS A FIFTY SIX YEAR OLD MEXICAN AMERICAN MAN WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. HE AND CO WAS MORBIDLY OBESE WITH THE WAY THAT HUNDRED POUNDS OVER HIS IDEA BY THE WAY HE COULD HAVE BEEN ANY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS OR FAMILY MEMBERS. FORTUNATELY HIS DOCTOR PRESCRIBED HIM FOOD PRESCRIPTION THROUGH A FOOD PHARMACY THAT OPERATED ON SITE IN THE CLINIC WAITING ROOM BEFORE KOBE. AND- AND NOW WE'VE SHIFTED IT TO WEEKLY DOORSTEP DELIVERY COULD DURING OPEN. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE FOOD FOR THE FOOD PRESCRIPTIONS. IS SOURCED FROM LOCAL FARMS THAT PROVIDE ME GENERALLY GOING THROUGH. THAT MEANS BEDSIDE FREE SEASONAL NUTRIENT DENSE FOOD THAT IS GOOD FOR HUMAN HEALTH AND SOIL HEALTH. MR ACTION GOT. NUTRITIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL COACHING TO AMPLIFY THE EFFECTS OF THE POOCH- PRESCRIPTION. BY THE END OF HIS TREATMENT THIS TRACK INCREASES FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE BY TWO. THIS IS NOTABLE BECAUSE AN INCREASE IN ONE SERVING PER DAY IF YOU EXTENDED ACROSS THE U. S. NATIONALLY. WOULD BE THIRTY THOUSAND LIVES SAVED OUR YEAR IS BLOOD PRESSURE DROPPED SIXTEEN POINT. FOR REFERENCE TEN POINT ELEVATION IN BLOOD PRESSURE THE SESSION WITH TWICE THE RISK OF DEATH FROM A HEART ATTACK OR STROKE. DIABETES REVERSED FROM POORLY CONTROLLED THAT LEVELS TO PRE DIABETIC RANGES. HE WENT FROM A C. INTO A LIFESTYLE TO EXERCISING FOUR POINT FIVE HOURS PER WEEK. AND A LOT SIXTY POUNDS. THE STORY OF MISTER X. HIGHLIGHTS HELP- PRESCRIPTIONS PLUS NUTRITIONAL BEHAVIORAL COACHING CAN BRING ABOUT ALL PERCENT CHANGE. IN ADDITION I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT OUR MODEL AND THE ALAMEDA COUNTY HAS DEMONSTRATED A 77% REDUCTION IN HOSPITAL AND YOU ARE RECEIVING THIS IS. A SIXTEEN POINT REDUCTION IN BLOOD PRESSURE IN OUR PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION ANY 47% REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION SCORES. IN SUMMARY THE PILOT FOOD PRESCRIPTION PROGRAMS SUPPORTED AN ASSEMBLY BILL THREE SIXTY EIGHT WILL FLATTEN THE CURVE. OF CHRONIC DISEASE. AND CLOSE THE GAP AND HEALTH DISPARITIES AND ADDRESS STRUCTURAL RACISM. I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I BUILT. ON IT ASSEMBLY BILL THREE SIXTY EIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND WIND WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WOULDN'T COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERVISOR WILMA CHAN CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HEALTH COMMITTEE AND THE SPONSOR OF AB THREE SIXTY EIGHT I SPENT SIX YEARS AS AN ASSEMBLY WOMAN INCLUDING TWO YEARS CHAIRING- THE HELP COMMITTEE. THIS LEGISLATION WAS PART OF RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE COBIT-NINETEEN RACIAL DISPARITIES TASK FORCE ESTABLISHED IN OAKLAND AND ALAMEDA COUNTY WHICH BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA AND I HAD THE PLEASURE OF CO CHAIRING. THE TASK FORCE HAD TWO GOALS IMMEDIATELY ADDRESSING THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES CREATED BY THE PANDEMIC AND SECONDLY ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT PERPETUATE RACIAL HEALTH DISPARITIES. THIS LEGISLATION ADDRESSES BOTH OF THESE GOALS BY USING FOOD PRESCRIPTIONS AS A MEDICAL INTERVENTION TO TREAT REBIRTH AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PREVENT THE PROGRESSION OF DIET RELATED CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION. AMONG A RISING RATE FOR MEDIC CAL POPULATION. AS A COVERED BENEFIT WHO- PRESCRIPTIONS WILL HELP MITIGATE GROWING RATE OF FOOD AND THAT NUTRITION AND SECURITY WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN THE PAST YEAR. UNDER THE PILOT- MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THREE COUNTY SCHOOLS DALGLISH FOOD PRESCRIPTION PROGRAMS THIS BILL USES AN EQUITY LENS TO TARGET POPULATIONS WITH THE HIGHEST HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE PILOT. AN ESTIMATED TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES HYPERTENSION OR ONE OF THE OTHER SPECIFIED HEALTH CONDITIONS WILL RECEIVE FOOD PRESCRIPTIONS WHICH WILL HELP THEM WITH THE PRESCRIBED NUMBERS OF STARVING. OF NUTRIENT RICH FOODS FOR THE LAND THAT THE INTERVENTION WHICH IS TEN TO SIXTEEN WEEKS. THE CARD PRESCRIPTIONS CAN BE COMPLEMENTED WITH EXISTING BEHAVIORAL COOKING OR NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAMS RUN TO APPOINTED BY MOST HEALTH PLANS. THE RESULT FROM FOOD PRESCRIPTION PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DRAMATIC AS DR CHAN HAS JUST TESTIFIED. THIS IS A HEALTH EQUITY ISSUE AS THE HEALTH CONDITIONS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR MAKING THEM DISPROPORTIONATELY VULNERABLE FOR COBRA NINETEEN RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATH. AS YOU KNOW RECENT CODE NINETEEN DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SHOW THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATIN ACTS COMMUNITIES REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PERCENT OF COPING NINETEEN. ILLNESS AND DEATH COMPARED TO THEIR- OVERALL POPULATION REPRESENTATION IN CALIFORNIA WE MUST DO BETTER THAN THIS. THESE HEALTH DISPARITIES EXIST BECAUSE OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO STOP DOWNSTREAM IT'S TIME TO ADDRESS THE SYSTEMATIC ISSUES THAT DRIVE THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. IN INNOVATIVE WAYS BY ADDRESSING THESE HEALTH CONDITIONS AT THE FRONT END WE CAN CLOSE THE PERSISTENT HEALTH DISPARITIES GAP IN OUR STATE WE CAN BUILD A CALIFORNIA RESILIENCE WITH HEALTHIER RESIDENTS LESS LIKELY TO BE HOSPITALIZED HOSPITALIZED. IN SIRIUS COM. OR DIE FROM CHRONIC- OR DISEASES LIKE COPD IN NINETEEN. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB THREE SIXTY EIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

TWELVE- FOR ITEM NUMBER NINETEEN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR FOR THEIR WORK- AND TIME ON THIS BILL AND ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. BUT BEFORE THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY UNEQUAL ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE THE CDC HAS FOUND THAT RACISM IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS CONTRIBUTED TO FUNDAMENTAL HEALTH INEQUITIES AND THE CDC IS HIGHLIGHTED THAT LIFE EXPECTANCY AMONG BLACK INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES IS FOUR YEARS LOWER THAN WHAT INDIVIDUALS AND IN SOME PARTS OF MY DISTRICT IT'S- UP TO TEN YEARS. THIS PANDEMIC IS FURTHER EXPOSED AND EXACERBATED THESE. THESE INEQUITIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. BLACK LATIN ACCENT INDIGENOUS PEOPLE ARE AT AN INCREASED RISK OF EXPOSURE ILLNESS HOSPITALIZATION. AND DEATH RELATIVE TO THEIR SHARE OF THE POPULATION. AS WE HAVE SEEN THE COVER NINETEEN MORTALITY RATE FOR BLACK INDIVIDUALS IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES THAT OF WHITE INDIVIDUALS. THEREFORE IT IS IMPORTANT NOW MORE THAN EVER. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE COMPLETE ACCURATE. AND TRANSPARENT DATA REPORTING IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO THE HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES IN OUR STATE. CURRENTLY OUR STATE IS LIMITED ON. HEALTH QUALITY AND WORKFORCE DATA AND THESE METRICS ARE NEEDED TO BEGIN ADDRESSING THIS THESE ISSUES. AB TROUBLE FOR REQUIRED THE COLLECTION OF DATA ON PATIENT HEALTH OUTCOMES BY RACE ETHNICITY AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRE COLLECTION OF WORKFORCE DATA. WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS DIVERSITY AND STAFF AND MANAGEMENT HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. MY OFFICE IN THE BILL'S SPONSORS HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS ASSOCIATION. WHO EXPRESSED CONCERNS REGARDING THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. THE BILL AND THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY SEIU AND SUPPORTED BY HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK AND OTHERS. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY ARE VERY. A VERY JUNE DíAS REPRESENTING US YEAH YOU AND STEPHANIE POWELL REPRESENTING US YEAH YOU YOU H. W. THANK. THANK YOU- THIS IS A PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINE FOR OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD EVENING THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD AND MEMBERS AND A FAMILY MEMBER WAIT FOR CHAMPIONING THE BILL MY NAME IS ANGIE THE ACT HERE ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA AND ARE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS MOST OF WHICH ARE FIVE NINETY CENTRAL HEALTH CARE WORKERS. WHO HAD SEEN HOW LACK OF ACCESS AND QUALITY OF CARE HAVE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BEFORE AND DURING THIS CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AS WE AS YESTERDAY DAYS AFTER DECLARING RACISM AS A PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT THE CDC RELEASED A PAIR OF STUDIES FURTHER QUANTIFYING THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF CLOTHING NINETEEN ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THE STUDY NOTED THAT THESE HEALTH DISPARITIES WERE NOT CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC BUT THEY WERE CERTAINLY EXACT EXACERBATED. BY CALLED THE NINETEEN. I DID I'M GOING. LEVEL IN THE DELIVERY AND QUALITY OF HEALTH CONTRIBUTION THESE HEALTH DISPARITIES. UNEQUAL HEALTHCARE TREATMENT HAS BEEN CAUSED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS. INCLUDING LACK OF ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY PROVIDER CARE ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS. UNCONSCIOUS BIAS OR STERN PERCEPTION THAT PROVIDERS MAY HAVE WHEN TREATING PATIENTS OF COLOR. PROVIDERS NOT POSSESSING OR OFFERING CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE- INTERPRETATION SKILLS ARE LANGUAGE ACCESS TO PATIENTS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY AMONG OTHERS. AB TROUBLE FOR WOULD ADDRESS RACIAL INEQUITIES IN HEALTHCARE BY REQUIRING HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO SHARE REYES DISAGGREGATED HEALTHCARE QUALITY AND WORKFORCE DATA. AS WE ALL KNOW COLLECTING AND UNDERSTANDING THE DATA ARE THE FIRST STEP. IN ORDER TO ENSURE PROVIDERS ARE FULFILLING THEIR PROMISE ON DELIVERING QUALITY CARE AND I GAVE BIRTH WORKFORCE EIGHTY TOTAL WAR WOULD ALSO REQUIRE PROVIDERS TO DEVELOP EQUITY PLAN TO ADDRESS SUCH DISPARITIES. ON TO ADDRESS SOME OF STATE CASE OPPOSITION. NOTED IN ANNOUNCES. I POTENTIAL CHIU. A H. R. K. IN NYC ACCORDING THIS THESE CHALLENGES HOSPITAL OR COLLECT AND REPORTING THESE BECAUSE THESE ARE QUALITY INDICATORS THAT ARE USED. BY A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANIZATIONS FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES. FOR EXAMPLE HOSPITALS NATIONWIDE USE THESE QUALITY INDICATORS TO ASSIST IN QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. ESPECIALLY IN ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS THIS SETTINGS ADDITIONALLY HOSPITALS USE THESE QUALITY INDICATORS TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ACTUALLY COMPARE WITH OTHER HOSPITALS IN RELATIONSHIP TO BOTH STATE AND NATIONAL AVERAGES. SECONDLY ON THE WORK FORCE AND T. DATA AB TOTAL FORCE REPORTING REQUIREMENT IS BASED ON THE PROVIDER MEETING BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS. BURKE B. I THEIR PRIVATE PUBLIC OR NONPROFIT PROVIDER WITH THREE HUNDRED OR MORE PHYSICIAN AND SECONDLY HAVING A HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES. THE BILL ACTUALLY LIMITS REPORTING TO THE PROVIDER THESE ARE EMPLOYERS THAT ARE ALREADY BEING REQUIRED TO REPORT ON THE HER FEDERAL E. O. ONE FORM- HAVING THIS DATA WILL HELP ENSURE AN EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE RESPONSE TO THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. AND OTHER DIFFERENT DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I BOTH. I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO ONE OF OUR AND YEAH YOU MEMBERS STEPHANIE PAULO FOR HER TESTIMONY I'M ALSO AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THAT YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS STEPHANIE PAULA A RESPIRATORY THERAPIST IN A LARGE HOSPITAL IN CINEMA COUNTY I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF SEIU YOU H. W. I WITNESSED FIRSTHAND. THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN HEALTH CARE. A MAJORITY OF MY PATIENTS WERE SPANISH LATINO AND A MAJORITY OF THEM WERE MIDDLE AGED FARMWORKERS WITH. UNDERLYING CONDITIONS- SUCH AS HYPERTENSION UNDIAGNOSED DIABETES PRE DIABETES- AND THAT DEFINITELY PUT DOWN AT A HIGHER RISK OF DEATH FROM CODED- IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE NINETEEN PREFERRED PEOPLE WITH. THEM DIABETES AND THESE PATIENTS ARE MANY OF THEM CONFIDED WITH ME THAT THEY HAD NO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE- EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE CITIZENS THESE WERE NOT JUST ILLEGAL CITIZENS THESE ARE CITIZENS THAT WERE FARMWORKERS GIVING THE JOB THAT MANY- ESSENTIAL WORKERS- HAVE. BEEN HELD IN JAIL. I FOUND IT VERY. THAT NOBODY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS- I WE SAW ON THE MEDIA WHAT WAS COMING DOWN THE PIPE- ESPECIALLY MY SISTER WHO LIVES BACKIN MICHIGAN SHE LIVES IN A PREDOMINANTLY AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. AND SHE WAS SEEING AT THE FACT HER COMMUNITY- A- MUCH WORSE THAN IT WAS THE CARD CASE COMMUNITY I WAS SEEING PROBABLY THREE HISPANIC PATIENTS FOR EVERYONE CAUCASIAN- PATIENT IN MY FACILITY. WE KNOW THAT THE DEFENDANT THE DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE ARE MULTIFACTORIAL WE KNOW THAT. THE SOCIO ECONOMICS ARE PROBABLY THE LEADING FACTOR BUT IT'S ALSO THAT THESE FAMILIES- ARE MULTI GENERATIONAL LIVING AND SMALL HOUSING UNITS- AND OTHER FACTORS. BUT ALSO THE LANGUAGE BARRIERS WERE- AT IT WAS A VERY ARE YOU NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK ENGLISH FOR MANY OF THESE PATIENTS- ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THESE NUMBERS OUT WHEN I TRIED TO TALK ABOUT THIS. MY MANAGER TOLD ME THAT I COULDN'T DISCUSS IT ANY FURTHER I TOLD HIM I WAS WELCOMED ON A RADIO SHOW HOPE TO TALK ABOUT- THE DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNTS OF LATINOS THAT WERE AFFECTED AND I CONFIDED THAT I KNEW I COULD NOT. TALK ABOUT HIPAA ANYTHING CONFIDENTIAL AND. SOMEBODY UP FROM QUALITY IS MOCKING ME ABOUT IT AND SAID THAT IT WAS PROPRIETARY DATA IT'S AN EXCUSE ME. YEAH I THINK LIKE HOW BIG HOW MANY BEDS WE HAVE LAST THAT THE HOSPITAL IS FULL YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT ANY OF THAT I SAID I GET THAT BUT I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE HOSPITALS ARE FULL THAT'S THE OBVIOUS. ALREADY HAD THAT OUT THERE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HIDE BUT THEN THEY WERE VERY CLEAR THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO GO TO THE WHICH COMMUNITY AND GET THE WORD OUT. I WENT HOME I DROVE HOME CRYING ALMOST WRECKED MY CAR I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE. ARE PROPRIETARY DATA THAT THAT THIS COMMUNITY THAT I LOVE TO WORK WITH- HANG OUT WITH. OUR PROPRIETARY DATA. I THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY TO TALK BE LEAGUE. SO WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS. RACE AND HEALTH CARE TRANSPARENCY ACT I WAS SO EXCITED. BECAUSE I THOUGHT. WHEN I READ THROUGH IT I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THIS WAS AN ALREADY TRANSPARENT- WE REALLY NEED IT WE REALLY NEED TO GET THE NUMBERS OUT. AND WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE THE SERIOUS- THERE ARE TRYING TO REACH ME THESE. THESE ARE. THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. AND I'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO THE LANGUAGE BARRIER WE HAVE COMPUTERS IN EVERY ROOM- ONE COMPUTER FOR EVERY CHU- SHE SAID THAT ARE IN A ROOM. SO THAT WAS ONE ISSUE IF ONE PATIENT DIDN'T SPEAK SPANISH AND THE OTHER PATIENT DID IT DID WE USUALLY CO WORDED OR COPD PATIENTS TOGETHER BUT THEY WORK TOWARD IT- PLEASE LEAVE YOUR COMPUTER PLEASE PLEASE WRAP WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WELL PAST OUR TIME HERE SO OKAY AS MEDICARE. PART IT WAS NOT. THE YOU EVERYTHING ENOUGH OF THESE CAN. WE HAD SOME IPAD THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH OF. IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE SPANISH SPEAKING NURSING ASSISTANTS THAT WERE THERE HELPING ME- I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH MANY OF THESE PATIENTS IN FACT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT. SO THAT'S WHY PART OF THIS BILL CALLS FOR- J. DATA AS WELL AS A PLAN FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND DIVERSITY OF THE STAFF. SO WE YOU NOTHING'S BETTER THAN A HUMAN TOUCH AND- YEAH I DID LEARN SOME SPANISH FOR THIS BUT WITH THE- BUSINESS YEAR. AND OFTEN VERY TRAUMATIZED BY WATCHING MIDDLE AGED HISPANIC MAN WHO WERE FAIRLY HEALTHY DINING AT A DISPROPORTIONATE RATE. AND I REALLY HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE AND- WILL HELP US PASSED THIS ACT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. I THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN. HELLO BARBARA HAD- THANK YOU AARON MEMBERS THIS IS BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. AB TWELVE OH FOUR WOULD REQUIRE HOSPITALS AND MEDICAL GROUPS TO ANNUALLY SUBMIT AN EQUITY REPORT THAT INCLUDES ANALYSES OF HEALTH STATUS IN ACCESS TO CARE DISPARITIES FOR PATIENTS ON THE BASIS OF RACE ETHNICITY AND PAIR. ADDITIONALLY THIS REPORT WOULD INCLUDE EMPLOYMENT DISPARITIES FOR EMPLOYEES ON THE SAME DAY STREET IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE PLANS FOR ADDRESSING THOSE DISPARITIES. WELL HA. THE GOAL OF REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES WE DO HAVE A POSITION OF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED ON AB TWELVE OH FOUR. IT'S A GREAT PLACE HA IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WITH REPORTING TO HEALTH OUTCOMES RELATED TO THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY INDICATORS. HOSPITAL CAN GENERATE INFORMATION ON WHOM THEY SERVE WHERE THEY LIVE IN THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICES DELIVERED. HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOSPITAL'S ABILITY TO COLLECT RELATED OUTCOMES DEPENDING ON HOW THEY WILL BE DEFINED BY OUR SPENT. THERE ARE OVER SIXTY EIGHT HR Q. INDICATORS. FOCUSED ON A DAHLE PREVENTION PEDIATRIC PREVENTION INPATIENT QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY AND HOSPITALS WILL NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE SPECIFIC MEASURES AND RELATED. OUTCOMES TO FOCUS THEIR REPORTING. IN HOSPITAL REMAIN FOCUSED ON ENSURING THEIR WORKPLACES ARE DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE FAIR AND EQUITABLE PAY POLICIES FOR ALL OF THEIR WORKERS. HOWEVER AB TWELVE OH FOUR REQUIRES THAT HOSPITALS AND ONLY HOSPITAL'S DIVULGE SENSITIVE PAID DATA THAT ARE PROTECTED UNDER BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW WE DO NOT BELIEVE REQUIRING HOSPITALS TO REPORT HOSPITALS PAY DATA IS THE APPROPRIATE PATH FORWARD. C. H. A. RECOMMENDS THAT AUSTIN HAD CONVENE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE COMPRISED OF A REPRESENTATIVE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS TO REVIEW INDICATORS AND OUTCOMES THAT INCLUDE A HR Q. INDICATORS. CLAIM AND ENCOUNTER DATA THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE VIA THE HEALTHCARE PAYMENTS DATA PROGRAM AND OTHER INFORMATION TO INFORM THE COLLECTION OF SPECIFIC MEASURES AND OUTCOMES FOR PROVIDER REPORTING. MARKET COULD THEN DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR EQUITY REPORTING BASED ON THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE'S FEEDBACK FOR HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIAN GROUPS.

WE EXPECT THEM TO BE BORN HEALTHY HAPPY AND READY TO LIVE A FULL LIFE UNFORTUNATELY SOME INFANTS ARE BORN WITH CRITICAL ILLNESSES. THAT REQUIRE SERIOUS MEDICAL ATTENTION AS SOON AS THEIR LIVES BEGAN SOMETIMES THE CAUSES OF THE INFANT INFANT SYSTEM. SYMPTOMS IS NOT EASILY DIAGNOSABLE AND DOCTORS OFTEN HAVE TO RESORT TO INVASIVE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND PROCEDURES IN THE MOST CRITICAL CASES DOCTORS HAVE TURNED A GENOME SEQUENCING A REVOLUTIONARY AND COMPREHENSIVE DIAGNOSTIC TOOL. THAT EXAMINES THE STRUCTURE OF A PATIENT'S DNA THE SIMPLE BLOOD TEST CAN POINT TO ABNORMALITIES ARE EXTREMELY RARE DISEASES THAT MAY EXPLAIN THE INFANT'S ILLNESSES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS CO CHAIR THE RARE DISEASE CAUCUS WE SECURE TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE BUDGET. DEFINE PROJECT BABY BEAR A PILOT PROJECT THAT EXPLORED THE BENEFITS OF RAPID WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING. IF IT WAS TREATED AS THE STANDARD OF CARE RATHER THAN A LAST RESORT. PROJECT BABY ARE SEQUENCED A HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT CRITICALLY ILL BABIES ON MEDIC CAL AND THE RESULTS WERE IMPRESSIVE. THIRTY FIVE RARE CONDITIONS WERE DIAGNOSED PATIENTS SPENT AN AVERAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED THIRTEEN FEWER DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL. AND ELEVEN FEWER MAJOR SURGERIES WERE PERFORMED RAPID WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING PRODUCED RESULTS THAT HELP DOCTORS DEVELOP A MORE TARGETED MANAGEMENT OF PATIENT CARE. AND ULTIMATELY SAVE THE STATE AN ESTIMATED TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND HEALTH CARE COSTS. UNFORTUNATELY THIS LIFE CHANGING TOOL ISN'T EQUITABLY ACCESSIBLE. PATIENTS ON MEDI CAL HAVE NEEDED TO RELY ON DONATIONS ARE CLINICAL TRIALS IN ORDER TO COVER THE COSTS OF THE SEQUENCING.

RELATIVELY RECENTLY IT'S A LITTLE BOY CALL RYAN HE ARRIVED IN OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT ELEVEN PM ON A SUNDAY NIGHT. AND HE HAD SIGNS SUGGESTING THAT HIS BRAIN WAS NOT FUNCTIONING NORMALLY HE WAS EXTREMELY IRRITABLE. WE DID A BRAIN SCAN WHICH SHOWED THAT HE HAD SEVERE BRAIN ANOMALIES AND WE ADMITTED THEM TO OUR INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. THE NEXT DAY HIS PHYSICIANS WHO WERE STUMPED TO KNOW THE CAUSE OF HIS ILLNESS. REQUESTED THAT WE PERFORM THIS MIRACULOUS NEW TECHNOLOGY RAPID WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING. WE DID THAT- WITHIN FOURTEEN HOURS WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF THE CHILD'S ILLNESS HE HAD A GENETIC DISEASE.
