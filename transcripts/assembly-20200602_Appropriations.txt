APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE HEARING- MY NAME IS THERE AND IT INVOLVES I AM SORRY I'M TAKING OFF MY MASK BECAUSE I CANNOT KEEP MY GLASSES FROM FOGGING UP. SO BUT I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY WHO IS. WEARING MASK AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. I'M WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND START BY ESTABLISHING A QUORUM BECAUSE THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF. ORDER BUSINESS THAT WE NEED TO START WITH IF MADAM SECRETARY IF YOU CALL THE ROLL. GONZALEZ PRESENT BIGELOW PRESENT. FARRAKHAN BLOOM BONTA CALDERON CARRILLO GEL. DOLLY DEEP EGGMAN PHONE GABRIEL. YOU GARCIA. PETRIE-NORRIS MCCARTY FOR QUIRK. ROBERT RIVAS VOEPEL REPUBLICAN VACANCY THANK CORPS. ALL RIGHT. BEFORE WE START I'M GOING TO JUST FOR I KNOW THAT. FOR HOME A LOT MORE PEOPLE ARE WATCHING THE NORMAL IN THIS COMMITTEE CAN BE A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING IN- IT'S NOT LIKE EVERY OTHER COMMITTEE- IN THE CAPITAL SO WE'RE GONNA EXPLAIN JUST BRIEFLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TODAY AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW. WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SEVEN BILLS IN FRONT OF US TO CONSIDER TODAY. THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THOSE BILLS AT A GOOD CHUNK OF THOSE BILLS- THAT COST OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WILL BE SENT TO THE SUSPENSE FILE. THAT FILE WILL BE DISPENSED OF TOMORROW MOST OF THOSE BILLS MOST OF THOSE AUTHORS OF WAVES AS AN TATIAN ON THOSE BILLS SO IF YOU HAVE A BILL THAT SAYS ON THE SUSPENSE OUT IN THE AUTHORS WAY PRESENTATION THAT MEANS THERE WILL BE NO DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT BILL. NOW IF YOU'RE LISTENING AT HOME AND YOU WANT TO COMMENT ABOUT YOUR POSITION AT THE VERY END WILL ALLOW YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THE BILL BUT THE AUTHOR DOES DO A PRESENTATION THERE IS NO- OPPOSITION PRESENTATION AS WELL. AS IF IT A THE A NUMBER OF BILLS WE WILL CONSIDER TODAY THOSE WILL BE HEARD TODAY IT LIKE A NORMAL BILL IN THOSE VOTES WILL BE TAKEN TODAY WE WILL ALLOW. TWO MINUTES OF- SUPPORTIVE COMMENTS AND TWO MINUTES OF COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION. AND THEN WE WILL GO TO- SUPPORT OR OPPOSE. AND THE ONLY. SPEAK TO IN SUPPORT PROPOSITION IS THE FISCAL ANALYSIS YOU CAN'T. I SPEAK TO THE POLICY MATTER AT HAND SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IF YOU'RE ONE THE PEOPLE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. TO A BILL THAT ACTUALLY BEING PRESENTED WE HAVE TO KEEP THE COMMENTS TO FISCAL. WINDOWS BILLS ARE HEARD- WE DON'T TAKE A VOTE IN THE NORMAL A ROLL CALL FASHION. THEY WILL EITHER PASS ON IN A ROLL CALL- WHICH MEANS WELL THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS VOTED FOR THE BILL- OR ON A B. ROLL CALL WHICH IS JUST THE DEMOCRATS VOTED ON A BILL- IF IT'S A SEA ROLL CALL. ME JUST THE REPUBLICANS VOTED AND THAT WILL NOT PASS- OR JUST DOESN'T PASS SO THOSE ARE THE OPTIONS. THERE'S NO BILLS THAT WILL GO ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR THAT MEANS THERE'S NO OPPOSITION TO BILLS- IN THIS CHAMBER A ON WILL VOTE ON THOSE AS A GROUP TOGETHER. SO I HOPE THAT HELPS EXPLAIN FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHAT WILL BE SAID IT I'M SURE IT WILL STILL BE SOME CONFUSING. THOSE BE SEEN CREATION BEFORE THAT I THINK CAN GO VERY LONG AND SO TO AVOID. THE STRIP IN THE POLLS IT. WILL A LOT TRY TO BEYOND THE RULES EITHER. A ANALYSIS IF YOU'RE OF THE WITNESS AND TESTIMONY OR SIMPLY SAYING YOUR NAME IN YOUR POSSESSION. SO THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TODAY I WANT TO- WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER CAME TO THE COMMITTEE IT'S HER FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING.

BILL AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SIX IN JOSHUA TREE PROTECTION ACT- I'D LIKE TO JUST ADDRESS THE FISCAL ANALYSIS THAT WAS A PRESENTED TO THE COMMITTEE. RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE'VE- WANTED TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE'VE AMENDED THE BILL TO CREATE MEDICATION FUN WITH SPECIFIC PURPOSE. OF PROTECTING THE PARK. MY INTENT IS AN ONLY IS THAT THE MONIES COLLECTED FROM THE PENALTIES OF THIS BILL WOULD BE USED TO MITIGATE ANY ENVIRONMENTAL. DAMAGE TO THE PARK. WELL THE ANALYSIS STATED- POTENTIAL COST PRESSURES AND LOW MILLIONS- THE FISCAL BURDEN WOULD NOT BE PUT ON THE STATE. BUT ON ANY POTENTIAL PROJECT THE VIOLATES THE TERMS OF THE BILL. BY CREATING THIS FUN WE WOULD GENERATE RESOURCESTHAT COULD BE USED TO PROTECT JOSHUA TREE WHICH IS ROUGHLY FIVE MILES FROM WHERE. A POSSIBLE RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECT IS BEING PROPOSED. JUST A TREE NATIONAL PARK AND ITS ENVIRONMENTAL TREASURES ARE VALUED BY MY CONSTITUENTS. THE ONLY FOR ITS ENVIRONMENTAL. A BEAUTIES OF BUT ALSO FOR ECONOMIC TOURISM AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE REGION- IT IS A VITAL- PLACE FOR OUR REGION FOR THE STING FOR THIS NATION WHICH IS WHY WE ARE. ATTEMPTING TO PUT THIS BILL FORWARD TO PROTECT- JOSHUA TREE ON JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A- COUPLE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS BILL- AND NOT TO GET. TOO INTO THE POLICY SIDE OF IT BUT IT'S TIED TO THE FISCAL HOUSES- WILL BE CLEAR THIS THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT A PROCUREMENT OF ANY. PARTICULAR PROJECT- IN THE REGION. AND THAT THAT'S BEEN PART OF THE COMMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD BY OPPOSITION- THE BILL ALSO CONTAINED NO LANGUAGE- THAT WOULD- THAT PUT A COST AND INCREASED OF. ENERGY COSTS TO RATEPAYERS THIS AGAIN IS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT. PROTECTION JOSHUA TREE AND THE THIRD AND FINAL POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE ABOUT THE BILL THE BILL ABSOLUTELY DRESSES. ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS BY IMPOSING MEANINGFUL STATE LEVEL SANCTIONS FOR ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY. WITH GROUND WATER AT USES- USES THAT WOULD BE- A REQUIRED BY ANY POTENTIAL PROJECT IN THIS AREA AND SO. WE ARE FOCUSED ON TRYING TO AGAIN PROTECT JOSHUA TREE- FOR MANY ADVERSE AFFECTS OF ANY POTENTIAL RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS WITHIN PROXIMITY TO THE PARK- RESPECTFULLY NAM. ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AS YOU. ENTERTAIN YOU KNOW THE SUSPENSE CANDIDATES ARE WE DO HAVE. TO INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY- PROVIDE SOME TESTIMONY TO THE BILL. I JUST WANT TO REMIND ON THE WITNESSES YOU WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES TOTAL- AND SO. HAD ADDED MISTER WET CHECKING FOR STARTING WITH YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GOT WHICH WILL BE HAVE TO CALIFORNIA STATE PATRIOTS COUNCIL THE STATE'S CESSATION OF LIKE WORKERS TO CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. THE ELEVATOR CONSTRUCTORS UNION IN THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL SHEET METAL WORKERS- THIS A BILLS REGARDING PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TO RENEWAL ENERGY PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA- ON THE REASON FOR THE BILL IS THAT THE BILL THE PROJECT HAS BEEN MALIGNED. BY CHARGES THAT THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION WOULD NOT AND FORCES OWN PERMIT. SO TO THE FISCAL ISSUES HERE- THIS PROJECT WOULD CREATE FIFTEEN THOUSAND JOBS IN APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX REVENUE PER YEAR THE TWO ISSUES RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS REGARDING THE COST IMPLICATIONS. IS THAT THERE'S POTENTIAL LEGAL COSTS FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD- PETITIONING FOR UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THIS BILL. THE FACT THAT FOR ACCEPTED ALL THIRTY OF THE PERMIT CONDITIONS REQUESTED BY THE WATER BOARD AND BY. A FISH AND WILDLIFE WITH THE COULD BE A VERY RARE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY WOULDN'T ENFORCE THEIR OWN PERMIT. AND THEN SECONDLY THE IT DENOUNCES POINTS OUT THAT THERE MAY BE COST PRESSURE. RESULTING FROM THE CREATION OF THE JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FUND- MEMBERS I WOULD I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THERE'S NO MORE RIGHTEOUS BECAUSE THE CREATING OF FUNDS TO PROTECT JOSHUA TREE AND THAT WE CAN WERE STATE WE CAN WITHSTAND THOSE PRESSURES SHOULD THEY COME TO BEAR. WE URGE AND I VOTE ON THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BILL THANK. WE GOT ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS LEFT.

IN DEALING WITH A COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN CRIME FIGHTING SITUATIONS WERE TIME OF IS OF THE ESSENCE SUCH AS LOCATING MISSING CHILDREN ARE VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IS AND HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY USEFUL. ITS USE HOWEVER ALSO COMES WITH SERIOUS CHALLENGES IN CONCERNS SUCH AS THE ACCURACY OF THESE SYSTEMS ON SOME RACIAL OR ETHNIC GROUPS AND BIASES IN FACIAL RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS THERE ARE ALSO CLAIMS ON THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS BY STATE AND PRIVATE ENTITIES TO TARGET IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND TO A PRIVATE RELIGIOUS MINORITIES AND DISCOURAGE FREE EXPRESSION UNFORTUNATELY CURRENT LAW WE HAVE A- IF ANY WE DISCOVER OR LIMIT ITS USE SOMEONE IS POLICIES HAVE BANNED THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY I PUBLIC ENTITIES BUT PRIVATE ENTITIES REMAIN LARGELY UNREGULATED WE CANNOT LEAVE IT TO A HANDFUL OF CITIES TO REGULATE INTO SPACE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT TO ADDRESS PRIVACY. BYPASS AND OTHER WELL ISSUES WOMEN'S HOPE PUBLIC PRIVATE ENTITIES EQUALLY.

WITHDRAW CONSENT AT ANY IME ACCESS THE LEAD CORRECT AND CHALLENGE ANY ENROLLMENT OF THE FACIAL IMAGES.

YOU MAY CONTINUE THANK YOU I'M A WILL ASSUME EVERYBODY SINCE WE HAD OPPOSITION DURING SUPPORT AND SUPPORT AS WELL WE WILL SUGGEST EVERYBODY'S BEEN SPEAKING ON TWENTY TO SIXTY ONE. I'M DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHILE THANK YOU- MR CHOW. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR FOR YOUR INDULGENCE SELL ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN SB ONE SIXTY NINE WAS UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE LEGISLATURE- IT'S OUGHT TO RESTRICT THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO PROTECT BOTH PERSONAL PRIVACY AND ALSO THE SECURITY OF COLLECTED DATA IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WERE GROUPS LIKE THE ACLU WHO IS NOW IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. LAST YEAR WHEN I AUTHOR A SMALL A BILL AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE REQUIRING BUSINESS TO DISCLOSE WHEN THEY ARE USING FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IT WAS OPPOSED BY THE ACLU AND THE OPPONENTS ARE SAYING THAT IT WAS AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT APPROPRIATE DISCLOSURE OF CONSENT THERE WAS ALSO CONCERN OF PROVIDING INFORMATION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITHOUT A WARRANT OR PROBABLE CAUSE. IN TWO THOUSAND ONE THE NARRATIVE OF BY THE ACLU IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE SIXTY NINE WAS THAT WE WERE ENTERING AN ERROR. OR TECHNOLOGIES OUTPACING A BASIC PRIVACY RIGHT. AND I'LL GOVERNMENT MISS EXERCISE SOME CONTROL OVER THE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING USE OF SOPHISTICATED FACE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS. BEFORE WE'VE BECOME A SOCIETY UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE. THIS BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY EXERCISE THAT CONTROL HOWEVER THE NARRATIVE OF THE OPPOSITION TODAY. IS TO PUSH FOR A MORATORIUMOF THE TECHNOLOGY. AND THAT THIS BILL EXPLICITLY GREEN LIKE THAT TECHNOLOGY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THAT LIKE HAS BEEN GREEN FOR TWENTY YEARS-WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. WORKERS ALSO INDIVIDUALS OUTSIDE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT WHO NEED PROTECTION FROM THIS TECHNOLOGY. LET ME CLEAR- DOES NOT EXPAND THE USE OF THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY TO EMPLOYMENT SETTINGS. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN INTEGRATED INTO OUR DAILY LIVES. OF. TWENTY THE CASE THAT WE TAKE CONTROL OF THE TECHNOLOGY RATHER THAN LETTING IT CONTROL US. FAILURE TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO REGULATE THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO REGULATE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE MORE AND MORE ENTITIES ARE DEPLOYING FACIAL RECOGNITION. SERVICES EVERY SINGLE DAY. DO WE WANT TO WAIT ANOTHER TWO DECADES ONLY TO LOOK BACK TO THE STATE. AND REALIZE WE FAILED ONCE AGAIN TO PROTECT OUR INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY PERSONALLY I REFUSED TO DO SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE THANK YOU.

AB NINETEEN FIFTY HAS A MOTION BY A MIS KERR RIO AND A SECOND BY MYSTERY BOSS MISS COM LONGER THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB NINETEEN FIFTY. WHAT'S THAT THE MAXIMUM PROBATION PERIOD OF FOR MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES IN TWO YEARS FOR FELONY OFFENSES. AB NINETEEN FIFTY CREATES REASONABLE AND EVIDENCE BUT IT'S ON PROBATION TERMS WHILE LOWERING COSTS TO TAXPAYERS INVESTING SAVINGS AND EFFECTIVE MEASURES PROVEN TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND INCREASING PUBLIC SAFETY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. YOU KNOW OUR ADULT SUPERVISED PROBATION POPULATION IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX THOUSAND IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST OF ANY STATE IN THE NATION WHICH MEANS THAT PROBATION OFFICERS FREQUENTLY ARE MANAGING. HELLO CASE LOW SUPERVISING PEOPLE DID OF MINOR OFFENSES BUT NONE THE LESS SENTENCED TO YEARS ON END OF SUPERVISION THE LONG SOMEONE STAYS ON PROBATION. CONSIDERED BECOME. IF BECOME. TAX DOLLARS DOWN THE DRAIN. MEANWHILE THE DAILY COST OF TO PROVIDE AND SOMEONE ON PROBATION IS ABOUT TO A DAY. PROBATIONERS COVER THE COST OF. EVERYTHING A LAB TEST EVERY SINGLE FEE EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY STEP INTO COURT THE AVERAGE DEBT BURDEN. OF THE THREE MOST CMMON FEES FOR SOMEONE INFORMATION IS MORE THAN THIRTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS FAILURE TO PAY THE FEES AND FINES WHILE ON PROBATION. OFTEN RESULTS IN A VIOLATION I HAVE TO SAY THAT- PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ARE WORKING ON A FAILED BUSINESS MODEL. AND AS A RESULT THE OUTCOMES ARE FAILING IT'S TIME TO MOVE TOWARDS SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE BEEN AND VIGOROUS CONVERSATION- WITH. OPPOSITION AND HAVE TAKEN MANY AMENDMENTS- ALTHOUGH I KNOW THIS IS A FISCAL POLICY AND NOT. EIGHT OF FISCAL COMMITTEE I'M SORRY NOT A POLICY COMMITTEE BUT I KNOW THAT THERE BEEN SOME CONCERNS- AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN ESPECIALLY IN THIS DAY AND AGE. IT'S A LAW THAT MAKES SENSE FOR EVERYONE. AB NINETEEN FIFTY WILL FREE UP STATE FUNDS THAT COULD BE USED FOR ANTI RECIDIVISM PROGRAMS. A LINE FOR THE REINVESTMENT OF FUNDING INTO SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE ON MISDEMEANOR AND FELONY PROBATION. RATHER THAN KEEPING THEM ON SUPERVISION FOR EXTENDED PERIODS. AB NINETEEN FIFTY MAKE FINANCIAL SENSE. FOR PROBATIONERS AND FOR PROBATION DEPARTMENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I THINK WE MAY HAVE A COUPLE OF WITNESSES ON THE PHONE. OKAY SO I AM THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION ON THE VERY UNICORN BILL THAT SAVES US MONEY. WITH THAT I'LL GO TO THE PHONES IN SUPPORT A. B. NINETEEN FIFTY DO WE HAVE SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT.
