THANK YOU MEMBERS WE HAVE A QUORUM WE'RE HEARING ONE BILL TODAY S. B. ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE BY SENATOR DORADO. SENATOR RAWSON FROM FORT VISIT YOUR BILL. ALSO CENTER DORADO I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TO ME WITNESSES IN SUPPORT VIA THE PHONE NUMBER HALF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION CORRECT. OKAY THANK YOU SO WHEN YOU'RE READY PLEASE BEGIN THANK YOU. I'LL FONG NEVER MADE. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE WHEELER FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OR THE VISION. THE ACT AND TIMELY BARGAINING UNIT INFORMATION TO WHICH THEY'RE ALREADY ENTITLED TO BY LAW. THAT WAY YOU CAN GO FAILED AS LEGAL. MEET THE NEEDS OF THE BARGAINING UNIT AS A WHOLE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LAW WAS SIGNED THE GRANTED PUBLIC EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATIONS ACCESS TO NEW HIRE CONTACT. INFORMATION WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THEIR HIRE DATE AS SPECIFIC BARGAINING UNIT DATA AT LEAST EVERY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. FOR EXAMPLE THIS INCLUDES ACCESS TO WORKSITE AND OTHER NECESSARY INFORMATION REGARDING NURSES ON THE FRONT LINES AT CRISIS HEALTH CARE CENTERS. FIREFIGHTERS FIGHTING WILDFIRES ACROSS THE STATE AND TEACHERS CURRENTLY FACING THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHERE WHEN AND HOW SAFELY THEY WILL RETURN TO WORK. DESPITE THIS SOME PUBLIC EMPLOYERS STILL CHOOSE TO IGNORE THEIR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SEND. INACCURATE OR OUT OF DATE INFORMATION. SAYS THE MOST RECENT REPORTING DEADLINE IN MAY TWENTY FOUR EMPLOYERS FAILED TO EVEN RESPOND TO THE BARGAINING AGENT WITH NO CONSEQUENCES. MANY EMPLOYERS IGNORE OR DISREGARD THE LEGAL OBLIGATIONS THEY HAVE. TO BOTH THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THE PUBLIC. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE WILL MAKE SURE PUBLIC EMPLOYERS DO A BETTER JOB AT HEARING TO THE LAW. IT ESTABLISHES THE CREDIBILITY MARRIAGES WITH PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE EMPLOYER TO CURE THE PROBLEM AND RESPOND. THIS MEASURE CREATES NO NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYERS. IT'S SIMPLY INCENTIVIZES COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAW. THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS IS NOT GOING AWAY SOON AND THEN PLOY IS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING REPRESENTATIVE HAS THE MRAL AND LEGAL DUTY TO WATCH OUT FOR THE WELFARE OF THESE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WHO IN TURN. WATCH OUT FOR THE PUBLIC'S WELLBEING. THIS CRISIS HAS SHOWN THAT TODAY IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ENTIRE BARGAINING UNIT. AND ENSURE WORKPLACE SAFETY. FOR THESE REASONS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY BRING ELEVEN- SB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE BEFORE YOU. URGENT I VOTE. AND I WILL HAVE OUR WITNESSES SPEAK NOW THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU CENTER SO NOW. THANK YOU SIR SO NOW IT'S GOING TO REMAIN WITNESSES WE'LL START WITH SIR FLOCKS WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND THEN AFTER WE HEAR FROM SUNDA. BORROWED FROM THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS THAT PLAYED SOCIAL ACTION CEREMONY THERE. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAN HEAR. WONDERFUL MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THERE ARE FLOCKS FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE'RE PROUD SPONSOR AS SB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE WE WERE ALO ONE OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE CURRENT LAW THAT GIVES ACCESS TO NEW HIRE DATA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES AND THAT WAS BECAUSE IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR UNIONS TO BE ABLE TO FIND WORKERS SO THAT WE CAN REPRESENT THEM. AS YOU KNOW PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OR WORKPLACES IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE FROM SMALL SCHOOLS TO MASSIVE HOSPITALS AND FAR FLUNG OFFICES. AND REALLY THIS PANDEMIC HAS MADE IT EVEN MORE CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO REACH WORKERS. WORKERS HAVE QUESTIONS ON ACCESS TO BP PAID SICK DAYS IF THEY HAVE TO QUARANTINE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE UNSAFE WORK AND A MYRIAD OF OTHER URGENT QUESTIONS AND ISSUES. SO RIGHT NOW AS AS UNIONS WE DON'T JUST HAVE A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO REPRESENT WORKERS WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT AND REPRESENT WORKERS DURING WHAT IS THE IS A REALLY SCARY TIME JUST TO COME TO WORK. DISTURB WALK INTO THE HEARING ROOM THAT YOU ALL ARE IN RIGHT NOW. AND UNFORTUNATELY SOME EMPLOYERS HAVE FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE CURRENT LAW. AND THERE'S LITTLE RECOURSE FOR UNIONS. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE CREATES A REAL DETERRENT BY ALLOWING UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGES AND ESTABLISHING EIGHT APRIL PENALTY. BUT IT'S ALSO A BALANCE BECAUSE IT GIVES EMPLOYERS WHO ARE TRYING TO COMPLY A RIGHT CLICK HERE AND A VERY GENEROUS RIGHT TO CARE. WE THINK THIS IS A REASONABLE BELT TO MAKE SURE UNIONS CAN. DO THE JOB THAT THEY THEY NEED TO DO TO FIND WORKERS THAT THEY REPRESENT AGAINST ACROSS THE STATE WITHOUT CREATING AN UNDUE BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM A SANDRA ARE YOU THERE FROM THE SCHOOL. CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. YES I'M HERE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IN GOVERNMENT OKAY YES WE'RE GOING HERE GO AHEAD. ALL RIGHT VANDERBUR ERROL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION WE ARE CO SPONSORS OF THE CELL THE GOAL OF AT ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE IS COMPLIANCE IDEALLY WE'D NEVER HAVE TO USE STAFF TIME AND RESOURCES TO GO TO THE PERFECT EMPLOYERS TO FOLLOW THE LAW. AND MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS CSEA REPRESENTS ARE IN COMPLIANCE SO OR INSTANCE OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY REPRESENT. THE MAJORITY HAVE THE FULL BARGAINING UNIT LISTS DUE IN MAY AND TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY DID NOT SUBMIT THE LISTS AND ARE THEREFORE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. AND THIS MOVE ACTUALLY IMPORTANT DURING THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE MANY OF OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS INCLUDING THOSE IN FOOD SERVICE. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ADEQUATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT VERNE TROYER'S. AND OTHER UNIONS THE NCCA WE ARE TRACKING BOTH EMPLOYEES DOWN AND ACTUALLY PROVIDING THE FROM PP TO THEM THROUGH THE UNION.

GOING TO THE SAME HE WILL BUT- I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS BILL IS ONE OF SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO ALTER THE BROKERED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER. PUBLIC EMPLOYERS AND PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS SURROUNDING PUBLIC EMPLOYEE ORIENTATIONS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS. REGARDING THE JANUS DECISION FROM ONLY THREE YEARS AGO. I'LL TAKE TO ADD FINANCIAL PENALTIES WHERE THERE COULD QUITE PURPOSELY BEEN DONE- THIS BILL WOULD BE HARMFUL TO PUBLIC AGENCIES SERVING THE PUBLIC AT AT THE BEST OF TIMES. BUT TO ADD FINANCIAL PENALTIES TO STRUGGLING PUBLIC AGENCIES DURING A PANDEMIC FOR OFFICE WORK MISTAKES WHILE ALSO ENCOURAGING EMPLOYEES NOT TO WORK IN THEIR OFFICES. JUST DOESN'T MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC TAX DOLLARS TO PAY FINES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES. NOT SO WEALTHY PRIVATE CORPORATION- BOTTOM LINE REDUCE PUBLIC DOLLARS RESULT IN REDUCED PUBLIC SERVICES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR POSITION I ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON SB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE. THANK YOU OPERATOR WE HAVE ANYBODY ELSE. THE TERM IN LINE NUMBER TWENTY NINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- CHICKEN SHELTER HERE ON BEHALF OF FOR THEM THAT PUBLIC RISK INNOVATION SOLUTIONS AND MANAGEMENT- ALL THE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF A DEAL AND ADDED AT A FEW THINGS- THAT I SAID THIS IN THE FIRST HEARING UPDATE AGAIN WE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT PUBLISHED THESE SHOULD BE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW- WE NEGOTIATED A LOT WITH FOLKS AND WE BELIEVE THE OTHER FOLKS TO COMPLY.

THAT NINETY SEVEN POINT 7% AND I GOT MORE STRUGGLING HOW THAT INDICATES THAT A SEVERE PROBLEM BUT AGAIN I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT THE WHAT THE OTHER WITH THAT SAID- ABOUT THERE BEING A HIGHER NUMBER. I GOT THAT WOULD POINT OUT. MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY WITH THE STRUGGLE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT SUBJECTS I DON'T KNOW THAT USING THAT- IN TERMS OF PAPERWORK FILING DEADLINE IS THE IT'S A GOOD. MECHANISM FOR DETERMINING HOW PEOPLE ARE ARE PERFORMING UNDER THE LAW- RIGHT NOW IT'S STILL AN INDICATED STATE LOCAL REVENUES ARE VERY LIMITED RIGHT- THE BOTH THE STATE AND CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE ARE WAITING. FOR FEDERAL STIMULUS HOPING TO BACK FILL COFFERS- SERVICES AE ARE BOOKED BY HAVING INCREASED DEMAND AND WE'RE HAVING A CHALLENGE FUNDING THEM- SO WE JUST DON'T KNOW THE RIGHT NOW.
