00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:45.302
RECOMMENDATIONS. IN THE

00:41:45.369 --> 00:41:47.671
ANALYSIS. AMBER THIS IS A BILL

00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:48.706
THAT IS A CONSUMER PROTECTION

00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:51.041
MEASURE. TO PROTECT SOME OF OUR

00:41:51.108 --> 00:41:52.610
MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:54.078
COMMUNITY. AND I'M JUST GONNA

00:41:54.144 --> 00:41:55.179
TAKE A SECOND TO TELL YOU THE

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:57.248
INSPIRATION FOR THIS BILL. IT

00:41:57.314 --> 00:41:58.816
CAME AFTER I HEARD A STORY ON

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:00.885
NPR. ABOUT A FAMILY WHO HAD A

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:02.953
SEVERELY AUTISTIC CHILD. WHO

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.655
THEY WANTED TO PURCHASE A

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:07.491
SUPPORT ANIMAL. TWO OF. THE

00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:09.793
THOUGHT TO HELP CALM THE CHILD

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.161
SO THEY PAID I BELIEVE IT WAS

00:42:11.228 --> 00:42:12.997
AROUND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:14.231
A DEALER WHO CLAIMED THAT THESE

00:42:14.298 --> 00:42:15.132
WERE SPECIALLY TRAINED SUPPORT

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:17.868
ANIMALS. TOOK THE DOG HOME. THE

00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:19.336
DOG IMMEDIATELY ATTACKED THE

00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:21.438
FAMILY'S OTHER PET. KILLED IT

00:42:21.505 --> 00:42:22.806
IN FRONT OF THIS CHILD CAUSING

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:24.341
DEEP TRAUMA TO THE CHILD WELL

00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:25.309
IT TURNS OUT THAT UNDER THE

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:26.911
LAW. THERE IS NO DEFINITION OF

00:42:26.977 --> 00:42:28.579
AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:29.446
THERE IS NO TRAINING THAT IS

00:42:29.513 --> 00:42:31.248
REQUIRED BY LAW. THIS WAS A

00:42:31.315 --> 00:42:33.317
FRAUDULENT SALE. TO A VERY

00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:33.851
VULNERABLE MEMBER OF OUR

00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:35.786
COMMUNITY. NOW THIS BILL IS

00:42:35.853 --> 00:42:37.321
INTENDED TO PROTECT THOSE THE

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:38.489
RIGHT TO PEOPLE WHO

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:40.124
CONSISTENTLY HAVE TO FIGHT FOR

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.659
EQUAL ACCESS TO PUBLIC SPACES

00:42:41.725 --> 00:42:43.327
AND BASIC CIVIL RIGHTS. TO

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:44.795
SAFETY AND INDEPENDENCE RATES

00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:45.863
AVAILABLE FREELY TO THOSE

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.866
WITHOUT DISABILITIES. EIGHTY

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:49.466
FOUR SIXTY EIGHT WOULD PREVENT

00:42:49.533 --> 00:42:50.734
THE SALE OF EMOTIONAL SUPPORT

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:52.569
ANIMALS AND THEIR EQUIPMENT. AS

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:54.038
BEING REPRESENTATIVE OF HAVING

00:42:54.104 --> 00:42:55.706
THE SAME RATES AS A GUIDE

00:42:55.773 --> 00:42:57.741
SIGNAL OR SERVICE DOG. AND IT

00:42:57.808 --> 00:42:59.043
REQUIRES A SILVER MOTIONAL

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:00.611
SUPPORT ANIMALS AND EQUIPMENT.

00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:01.612
TO BE ACCOMPANIED WITH A

00:43:01.679 --> 00:43:03.047
WRITTEN NOTICE EXPLAINING TO

00:43:03.113 --> 00:43:04.949
CONSUMERS BUT THEY DID NOT

00:43:05.015 --> 00:43:06.617
CONFIRM THE SAME TRAINING. THE

SAME FOR THE SAME BENEFITS AS

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:11.021
AS GUIDE DOGS AND SERVICE DOGS.

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:12.523
THIS BILL WOULD ALSO PROHIBIT A

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:14.191
HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONER.

NEED FOR AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:20.564
DOG. THAT IS NOT A GUIDE OR

00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:22.599
SERVICE DOG AS DEFINED. AND

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:23.434
LESS THE HEALTHCARE

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.702
PRACTITIONER COMPLIES WITH

00:43:24.768 --> 00:43:27.071
SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. IT IS A

00:43:27.137 --> 00:43:28.339
PRIVILEGE NOT A RIGHT TO BE THE

00:43:28.405 --> 00:43:29.606

00:43:31.342 --> 00:43:33.444
CLASSIFICATIONS DO NOT MERIT

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:34.311
THE SAME LEVEL OF PUBLIC

00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:36.246

00:44:11.515 --> 00:44:13.150
CREATES CONFUSION TO THE OWNER

00:55:39.402 --> 00:55:41.504
THE PROBLEM. GOING FORWARD AND

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:42.472

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:48.411
ALSO AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT

00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:49.379

LINE THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR COULD

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:29.037
NOT LIVE ABOVE COULD NOT TRAVEL

01:28:29.103 --> 01:28:33.074

WAS RAISED IN THE SOUTH SIDE

01:28:35.043 --> 01:28:37.779
AND HAVE MOVED INTO- THE

01:28:37.845 --> 01:28:39.881
EUROPEAN NEIGHBORHOOD AND NOW

01:28:39.947 --> 01:28:42.850
IS THERE A IS MOVING ON- IN HIS

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:45.453
HOME WAS I THINK I GET IT LESS

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.588
THAN. BEFORE ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:48.623
THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS THA

01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:49.057
SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE

01:28:49.123 --> 01:28:51.392
NEIGHBORHOOD- CABIN IS ON THE

01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:53.227
WAY HOME. AT THE END AND THEY

01:28:53.294 --> 01:28:54.328
WERE JUST THEY WERE SHOCKED AND

01:28:54.395 --> 01:28:55.763
THEN IT IT IT PREVENTED THEM

01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:57.331
FROM BEING ABLE TO BUY THE HOME

01:28:57.398 --> 01:28:59.701
THAT THEY WANT TO BUY. AS FOR

01:28:59.767 --> 01:29:00.568
THEIR NEXT PLACE BECAUSE IT

01:29:00.635 --> 01:29:02.136
WAS. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:03.337
ENOUGH FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT

01:29:03.404 --> 01:29:05.206
THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE. SO

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:06.908
UNDERVALUED AND THEN THE BUYER

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:08.843
THEN COULDN'T GET A LOAN- THAT

01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:11.245

01:29:16.584 --> 01:29:17.552

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:27.862
JUST ANOTHER FORM OF. BEST

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:28.529
PRACTICES ANOTHER FORMER

01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:30.898

WHAT SOMEBODY'S EARNED IN THEIR

01:29:31.933 --> 01:29:33.434
EQUITY THAN THAT ALSO LIMITS OF

WHERE THEIR NEXT HOUSE CAN BE-

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:37.305
AND SO ON AND SO ON SO THIS. IS

01:29:37.371 --> 01:29:39.006
AN ISSUE THAT CAN CONTINUE TO.

01:29:39.073 --> 01:29:40.341

THAT THERE IS AN ENFORCEMENT

02:06:06.792 --> 02:06:08.260
MECHANISM. THAT IS NOT THE

02:06:08.327 --> 02:06:09.695
DESIRE TO BE PUNITIVE BY ANY

02:06:09.762 --> 02:06:11.297

02:06:32.785 --> 02:06:34.086
ADDITIONAL BURDEN. A

02:06:34.153 --> 02:06:36.121
SPECIFICALLY- THE THAT IS THE

02:06:36.188 --> 02:06:37.723

THE ISSUE THE MISDEMEANORS ALSO

02:07:00.746 --> 02:07:02.281
THAT SOMEONE ACTUALLY NEEDS

02:07:02.348 --> 02:07:04.550
MENTAL HEALTH. HELP WE DON'T

02:07:04.616 --> 02:07:06.852
DISCOURAGE THEM BECAUSE IT FROM

02:07:06.919 --> 02:07:08.020
FROM DOING THAT THINKING THAT

02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:09.355
MAYBE THERE MIGHT BE A PENALTY

02:07:09.421 --> 02:07:10.789
IF THEY MISREPRESENT THEMSELVES

02:07:10.856 --> 02:07:12.324
OR SOMEONE THINKS THAT WAY. THE

02:07:12.391 --> 02:07:13.425
TIME WITH YOU THINK SOME OF IT

02:07:13.492 --> 02:07:14.893
I THINK OTHER MECHANISMS STILL

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:16.462
FILTER OUT LIKE. THAT AND I'M

02:07:16.528 --> 02:07:18.497

02:07:21.567 --> 02:07:22.634
THE SYSTEM MAYBE I'M BEING

02:07:22.701 --> 02:07:25.104
NAIVE ABOUT THAT BUT- HEY. YOU

02:07:25.170 --> 02:07:26.305
KNOW I HATE IT I WANT TO BE

02:07:26.372 --> 02:07:28.140
SURE WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RE

02:07:28.207 --> 02:07:29.241
HARD ENOUGH FOR HEALTH

02:07:29.308 --> 02:07:30.142
PROFESSIONALS TO ADMIT THEIR

02:07:30.209 --> 02:07:31.677
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. SO WE

02:07:31.744 --> 02:07:35.748
DON'T WANT. TO MINIMIZE

02:07:35.814 --> 02:07:36.315
