I'M ALSO HERE WITH IMMENSE GRATITUDE FOR THE MANY HOURS OF COLLABORATION THAT WENT INTO THIS RESOLUTION. COLLABORATION BETWEEN AND AMONG LGBT Q. LEADERS INCLUDING LGBT Q. PEOPLE OF FAITH FAITH LEADERS AND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED ADVERSELY BY CONVERSION THERAPY. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE A QUALITY CALIFORNIA CO SPONSORED THE BILL THAT ULTIMATELY PROHIBITED LICENSED MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS FROM PERFORMING SO CALLED CONVERSION THERAPY ON YOUNG ADULTS ARE. PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. SINCE THEN EIGHTEEN OTHER STATES HAVE ENACTED SIMILAR LAWS DEMONSTRATING A GROWING NATIONAL CONSENSUS THAT THESE PRACTICES ARE DANGEROUS AND DAMAGING. UNFORTUNATELY THESE PRACTICES ARE STILL CARRIED OUT BY PEOPLE WHO ARE ENTRUSTED TO CARE FOR THE EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING OF OTHERS. ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND STILL RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. LGBT Q. PEOPLE ATTEMPT SUICIDE MORE OFTEN EXPERIENCE DEPRESSION MORE OFTEN AND EXPERIENCE HOMELESS THIS MORE OFTEN THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LGBT Q. WHY IT'S BECAUSE LGBT Q. PEOPLE ARE TOO OFTEN TOLD THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM AND US. AND THE PRACTICE OF CONVERSION THERAPY SENDS THAT MESSAGE. LOUD AND CLEAR AND RESULTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE AND DAMAGE THAT CAN CAUGHT LITERALLY COST LIVES. LET ME BE CLEAR THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH LGBT Q. PEOPLE AND THE NATION'S LEADING PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATIONS THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN COUNCIL SAYS COUNSELING CESSATION NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS. AND AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAVE REJECTED CONVERSION. B. AS UNNECESSARY INEFFECTIVE AND HARMFUL AND TODAY WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU DO THE SAME THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS TIM RAMEL AND I'M A CONVERSION THERAPY SURVIVOR AND AUTHOR. AND I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD OF THE STORIES LIKE MINE IS A CONVERSION THERAPY SURVIVOR BUT WHAT MAKES MY DIFFERENT AS I WAS ALSO CONVERSION THERAPY LEADER. I ATTEMPTED SUICIDE BEFORE GOING INTO CONVERSION THERAPY BECAUSE THAT WAS MY LAST HOPE. AND SO I NEEDED SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING TO RECONCILE MY FAITH WITH MY REALITY. AND DURING THE TIME THAT I WAS THERE I TRULY BELIEVE THAT GOD HAD CHANGE ME. AND IN FACT I BELIEVE THAT SO MUCH THAT AFTER I WENT THROUGH CONVERSION THERAPY I WENT ON STAFF WITH THIS ORGANIZATION AND IT WORKED FOR THEM FOR FIVE YEARS. DURING THAT TIME I GOT MARRIED EVENTUALLY HAD TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS. AND I TRAVEL THE NATION PREACHING THIS MESSAGE THAT I WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS FREEDOM FROM HOMOSEXUALITY THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. TEN YEARS AFTER I LEFT THE MINISTRY. OFF THE STAGE AND AWAY FROM THE SPOTLIGHT. REALITY SET IN FOR ME AND MY LIFE CAME CRASHING DOWN. AND I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING SO DEEPLY FLAWED WITHIN ME THAT I WAS AND REDEEMABLE AN UNREACHABLE. THAN AND LOVABLE. I HAVE TO SAY IT'S BEEN NEARLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS SINCE I WAS INVOLVED IN CONVERSION THERAPY. BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU OF THE PASTORS OFFICER YOU CLOSE THE THERAPISTS DOOR. DOESN'T MEAN THOSE MESSAGES GO AWAY. THEY DON'T. I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO BE WITH THE MAN IS NOW MY HUSBAND FOR NEARLY TEN YEARS AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE HAD IN OUR RELATIONSHIP STEM FROM THOSE MESSAGES THAT I HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN MY EVANGELICAL UPBRINGING. AND IN THE CONVERSION THERAPY MOVEMENT. AND AT TIMES IT ALMOST DESTROYED US. CONVERSION THERAPY IS DISRUPTIVE. IT'S DESTRUCTIVE. AND THE EFFECTS OF THAT ARE FELT IN PEOPLE SOMETIMES MANY MANY YEARS AFTER THEY LEAVE IT AFFECTS FAMILIES AND IT AFFECTS INDIVIDUALS. WHAT I WISH SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME THIRTY YEARS AGO. WAS THAT I COULD HAVE LIVE A LIFE OF FAITH I COULD HAVE A LOVING HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEBODY OF THE SAME SEX. I WISH SOMEBODY HAD TOLD ME YOU'RE LOVABLE NO MATTER WHAT. AND YOUR ACCEPTABLE AND YOUR VALUABLE AND YOUR VOICE NEEDS TO BE HEARD.

GOVERNMENT HAS NO JURISDICTION TO DICTATE TO THE CHURCH WHAT IT SHOULD BELIEVE DO SAY OR HOW IT COUNSEL CITIZENS. WHY WHY IS THAT TRUE. THE FIRST AMENDMENT EMBEDDED IN THE CONSTITUTION'S BILL OF RIGHTS GUARANTEES OUR UNALIENABLE AND FUNDAMENTAL CIVIL RIGHTS INCLUDING THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION AND THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. ACR NINETY NINE IS AN ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THE BELIEVES WORDS AND PRACTICES OF CITIZENS REGARDING THE CONTROVERSIAL AND SENSITIVE TOPIC OF HUMAN SEXUALITY. IT TARGETS CHILLS AND SUPPRESSES FREE SPEECH AND RELIGIOUS FREE EXERCISE FURTHERMORE IT UNFAIRLY DISPARAGES RELIGIOUS GROUPS AND PEOPLE BLAMING THEM FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND HIGH SUICIDE RATE IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY. THE RIGHT TO DISSENT IS A FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN RIGHT ROBUSTLY PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT. THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DEFINE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SEXUAL IDEOLOGY OR TO ENFORCE ITS CENTRAL ORTHODOXY ON PEOPLE OF FAITH. SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY ARE NOT FIX THEIR FLUID. PEOPLE CAN CHANGE PEOPLE DO CHANGE OUR CITIZENS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE FAITH SHOULD REMAIN FREE TO HAVE THE CHOICE TO SEEK OUT CHANGE ALLOWING THERAPY WITHOUT THE STATE TRYING TO DESTROY THE CHOICE TO OR WELL IN LEGISLATION LIKE AB TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE AND ACR NINETY NINE. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS PONDERING THIS RESOLUTION TO BE MINDFUL TO SUPPORT COURT CASES AND RULINGS LAST YEAR IN MASTERPIECE CAKE SHOP THE COLORADO STATE COLORADO FOUND WAS FOUND HIM UNFAIRLY TARGETED JACK PHILLIPS CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS BELIEFS ABOUT MARRIAGE HOLDING THAT EVEN SUBTLE DEPARTURES FROM RELIGIOUS GOVERNMENT RELIGIOUS NEUTRALITY VIOLATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT. FOR THE MORE IN DEPTH OF RESERVISTS SURE THE COURT OVERTURNED CALIFORNIA'S AB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE WHY BECAUSE IT UNFAIRLY TARGETED PREGNANCY CARE CENTERS AND UNCONSTITUTIONALLY COMPELLED GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED SPEECH ACR NINETY NINE IS RELIGIOUSLY INTOLERANT IT'S NOT INCLUSIVE OF PEOPLE OF FAITH AND IS A DANGEROUS STEP TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION OF DIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA. PEOPLE FACE SHOULD NOT BE MADE TO FEEL LIKE ON WELCOME OUTSIDERS IN THE STATE THANK YOU WRONGLY RIVER URGE YOU TO VOTE AGAINST THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS BUT GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM PHYLLIS TOLLS REPRESENTING DR SAM YOUR RODRIGUEZ WITH.

TO ENGAGE IN POWER AND IN RICH EVERY HUMAN LIFE THROUGH THE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF GOD'S WORD. TO ADVOCATE AN INDIVIDUAL'S FREEDOM TO CHOOSE QUESTION AND CHANGE. ACR NINETY NINE WOULD PROHIBIT THE SAME INDIVIDUALS THEIR FREEDOM. TO SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP THROUGH PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE SAFE LEGAL THERAPEUTIC SERVICES. JESUS CHRIST DIED AND ROSE AGAIN SO THAT EVERY HUMAN BEING CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF GOD COULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO NOT BE CONTROLLED BY THEIR PHYSICAL OR SEXUAL DESIRES BUT RATHER EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO CHANGE. NOT ONLY IN THEIR SEXUALITY BUT ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR LIFE. AS A PROBLEM MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER IF THESE WERE MY GRANDCHILDREN I WOULD WANT THEM TO BE FREE TO SEEK COUNSELING FROM ORGANIZATIONS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN LINE WITH THEIR PERSONAL VALUES.

SENATORS THANK YOU MY NAME IS JONATHAN KELLER PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL I FIRST OFF ON A STATE ASSEMBLYMAN LOW THANK YOU FOR YOUR OUT REACH TO THE FAITH COMMUNITY. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS HE'S MADE TO HEAR OUR CONCERNS RESPECTFULLY WE STILL MUST OPPOSE THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS SENATOR UMBERG YOU HAD A QUESTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THAT QUESTION THE OPPOSITION I LISTEN YOUR TESTIMONY AND SO THEN I ACTUALLY READ THE RESOLUTION. AND I'M WONDERING WHAT PARTS OF THE RESOLUTION SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU OPPOSED TO. AS I READ THE PORTIONS THAT SAID THAT THE LEGISLATURE CALLS UPON RELIGIOUS LEADERS. DID COUNSEL. LGBT Q. MATTERS REPLACE OF LOVE AND COMPASSION IS THAT. ARE YOU OPPOSE THAT PART. ARE YOU OPPOSED I'M SORRY GO AHEAD YOU ARE NO WE'RE NOT AT ALL OF ALL TO LIVE IN COMPASSION. OKAY WHAT WHAT PART SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU OPPOSED TO. ON. I AM AGAINST THE PART THAT THE BLAMES FAITH COMMUNITIES FOR THE STIGMA AND HIGH SUICIDE RATES IN THE MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS I THINK THE SOCIAL SCIENCE DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT AS A MATTER OF FACT IT'S THE OPPOSITE I'M AGAINST THE PARTS OF THE BILL THE CALL ON A RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND PASTORS AND CHURCHES SPECIFICALLY TO TAKEN AFFIRMING POSITION ON LGBT ISSUES WHEN OUR FAITH COUNSELS US IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION SO WE'RE NOT AGAINST LOVE WERE NOT AGAINST COMPASSION. WE JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON SEXUAL ISSUES AND SO IT'S NOT THE JOB OF THE STATE TO TELL THE CHURCH WHAT TO BELIEVE OR HOW TO COUNSEL I DON'T SEE THAT IN THE RESOLUTE WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED AS SIMPLY DON'T SEE THAT IN THE RESOLUTION THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING ABOUT SPECIFIC PORTIONS THAT YOU DISAGREED WITH SO FOR EXAMPLE IT CALLS UPON RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO MODEL EQUITABLE TREATMENT OF ALL PEOPLE OF THE STATE OR- THAT WHEN YOU'RE OPPOSED TO DO NOT NOT AT ALL. AS A MATTER OF FACT WE'RE FOR LOVE WERE FOR COMPASSION WERE FOR EQUITABLE TREATMENT. WE JUST BELIEVE THAT THE STATE. THIS IS THE FIRST BILL THAT I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY TWENTY FIVE YEARS INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. WHERE SPECIFICALLY EVEN THOUGH TO RESOLUTION IT DOESN'T HAVE BINDING AFFECTING TEETH. IT CALLS OUT CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO TAKE A SPECIFIC. PERSPECTIVE ON MORALITY AND SEXUALITY HUMAN SEXUALITY AND THAT IS NOT THE JOB OF THE STATE AND SO AS A RESOLUTION OF THE STATE. EVEN BILLS THAT DON'T HAVE TEETH BILLS THAT CHILL RELIGIOUS FREE EXERCISE OR BILLS THAT CHILL RELIGIOUS SPEECH. ARE ALSO UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE COURT SAID LAST YEAR IN THE CASES OUT OF COLORADO I CITED EARLIER. THE EVEN SUBTLE DEPARTURES FROM NEUTRALITY OF THE STATE TOWARDS RELIGIOUS GROUPS. IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL THIS IS MORE THAN JUST SUBTLE. LACK OF NEUTRALITY TOWARDS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND PRACTICES IT'S SPECIFICALLY TELLING US WHAT TO BELIEVE HOW TO PREACH AND HOW TO COUNSEL AND THAT'S BLATANTLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THANK YOU JUST BUILD ON WHAT MY WHAT MY COLLEAGUE IS SAYING WITH RESPECT TO THE GENTLEMEN I THINK HERE. IT WOULD LIMIT OTHER PEOPLE'S FREEDOM TO BE ABLE TO THINK THAT FAME COUNCIL WE BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT FOR CHOICE. SO IF I AM OR IF MY GRANDCHILDREN I USE THAT AGAIN AS AN EXAMPLE A PROBLEM MOTHER OF TWO AND TWO GRANDCHILDREN. IF THEY WERE IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY I WOULD WANT THEM TO HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SEEK RELIGIOUS COUNCIL THAT ALIGNS WITH THEIR VALUES AND BELIEF SYSTEM. AND THIS WOULD TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THEM WE'RE NOT SAYING THERE WERE OPPOSED TO ANYONE THAT WE DON'T LOVE OF COURSE WE DO BUT WE ALSO WANT THE RIGHT. FOR THOSE WHO SAY I DESIRE CHANGE OR AT LEAST TO QUESTION IT AND TO SEEK THE COUNSEL ALLOWED WITH OUR. VALUES BASED UPON THE BIBLE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT. ADAM CHAIR ALL OF US HERE. OF COME TO THIS JOB WITH THE- EXPERIENCES OF OUR OWN AND WE ALL APPLY THOSE EXPERIENCES TO OUR PERSPECTIVE. AND I THINK ALL OF US BELIEVE THAT THE STATE HAS A DUTY TO PROTECT CERTAIN CITIZENS AND I COME HERE WITH THE PERSPECTIVE. FROM WATCHING MY BROTHER IN LAW GOES THROUGH CONVERSION THERAPY AND THE HARM THAT IT DID TO HIM. INTO ITS ENTIRE HIS ENTIRE FAMILY. SO I BELIEVE THE STATE DOES HAVE A VERY STRONG INTEREST IN PREVENTING THAT KIND OF HARM IN HAVING WITNESSED IT MYSELF I I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT AND I COMMEND YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. LOW FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS THANK YOU EXCUSE ME THERE'S NO QUESTION EXCUSE WAS NO QUESTION PENDING. THANK THANK YOU CENTER NUMBER CENTER JONES YOU HAVE A QUESTION. MADAM CHAIR AND I'M AT I THINK A SINNER AMBERG FOR ACTUALLY BRINGING UP THAT EXACT PARAGRAPH BECAUSE IT WAS A- KIND THE PARAGRAPH THAT ICE SIGNALLED SINGLED OUT AS- AS HAVING SOME CHALLENGES WITHAND THE- THE PARAGRAPH DOES. SAVE A PLACE OF LOVE AND COMPASSION. WHICH IN MY EXPERIENCE AS A FORMER PASTOR. MOST MOST OF THE FOLKS THAT I KNOW IN THAT PROFESSION TO COME FROM THAT ANGLE OF LOVE AND COMPASSION REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE- EVENTUAL OUTCOME OF THE OF THE COUNSELING IS. BUT WHERE THE PARAGRAPH GOES TOO FAR IF YOU. KEPT QUOTING ON THERE IS. IT'S THE STATE THROUGH THE AC ARE REQUIRING THOSE COUNSELORS. IN A PLACE OF LOVE AND COMPASSION TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ANOTHER HARMS OF CONVERSION THERAPY. WELL THAT'S THE DEBATE AND I THINK THAT. THAT THAT'S THE IF I'M UNDERSTANDING THE OPPONENTS PROPERLY AND CORRECTLY. THAT'S THE PART OF ACR THAT THE BIGGEST PART ACR THAT GOES TOO FAR IS THE STATE COMPELLING THEM TO ACKNOWLEDGE. COME FROM A BACKGROUND AND LIFE EXPERIENCE OF SEEING POSITIVE RESULTS OF THAT CONVERSION THERAPY SO I JUST WANTED TO BUT ON THE WRECK I'M HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS LATER BUT IS ONE TO ADDRESS THAT SINCE IT WAS. I THANK YOU SENATOR PORCHES FOLLOWED BY A SENATOR GONZALEZ AND THEN SENATOR RUSSELL. FIGURE CHAIRWOMAN. I THINK THE FACT THIS IS A RESOLUTION AS OPPOSED TO. A SUBSTANTIVE PIECE OF LEGISLATION SPEAKS VOLUMES BUT UNFORTUNATE THINK WHEN WE HAVE HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS YOU KNOW EVEN SYMBOLIC. ON DISCUSSIONS TAKE ON GRAVITY. I KIND OF WANT TO JUST TO REAFFIRM THE FRAMEWORK THAT WERE. SEEING THIS ISSUE WITH. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PRIVATE SETTING IN A CHURCH OR A MINISTER IS THAT CORRECT IT'S NOT A PUBLIC SETTING RIGHT. AND IS IT VOLUNTARY. AND IT IS A CONFIDENTIAL YES IS IT ARE YOU AWARE OF MINISTRIES CAM CONDITIONING THEIR MEMBERSHIP OF THAT INDIVIDUAL ON THE TO THIS COUNSELING ANDULTIMATELY THROUGH A CONVERSION THERAPY PROCESS DISHING THEM YEAH MEANING THAT THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR MEMBERSHIP IN THE MOSQUE THE TEMPLE THE CHURCH. ALL RIGHT I HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN REARED GREEK ORTHODOX FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN ON GREEK ORTHODOX. I HAPPENTO HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS ON YOUR FRIENDS IN THE LGBT. COMMUNITY I HAVE RECONCILED ABSOLUTELY MY FAITH WITH MY ABILITY TO EXPRESS MY LOVE AND COMPASSION. TO MY FRIENDS IN THOSE OUTSIDE OF MY FAITH AND I KNOW FOLKS WHO ALSO. MAYBE HOMOSEXUAL OR WITHIN THIS COMMUNITY WHO ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH SO THERE'S A RECONCILIATION IT MAY BE THAT WORKS FOR SOME MAYBE NOT FOR EVERYONE BUT THE ISSUE HERE AT LEAST IN MY OPINION. IS THAT. WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND THEN THERE'S A FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. AND SO FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT. WELL I HAVEN'T WEIGHED IN ON CONVERSION THERAPY AND FRANKLY DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT IT I MUST CONFESS MAYBE IT IS STRICT MAYBE IT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AYE I'M NOT IN THE FIELD OF THAT AREA OF STUDY. BUT JUST REMAIN FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND FREEDOM OF RELIGION STANDPOINT I DON'T KNOW HOW WE WOULD WANT TO ON DO THE PROTECTIONS THAT. OUR CONSTITUTION ALLOWS OF FOR THOSE IN THE FAITH COMMUNITY. GIVEN THE FACT THAT EVERYTHING THAT YOU JUST SAID IS VOLUNTARY CONFIDENTIAL AND ARE NOT CONDITION YOUR MEMBERSHIP IN THAT RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION. RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ. YOU AND I AM I'M ALWAYS GRAPPLING JUST PERSONALLY BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT OUR TOPIC FOR MANY OF THE RESIDENTS THAT I REPRESENT WHO ARE AT LONG BEACH RESIDENTS MANY OF WHICH TO DO IDENTIFIES LGBT Q. WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH CONVERSION THERAPY AND HAVE SEEN VERY POOR POOR AND DETRIMENTAL RESULTS AND SO I COME FROM THAT LENDS FIRST AND FOREMOST AS A REPRESENTATIVE THAT HAS OF A MULTITUDE OF NOT ONLY FRIENDS BUT- PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT. SO I THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND FOR YOUR EYES SUPPORTERS FOR BRINGING THIS FORD ENSURING THEIR STORY AS WELL AS THE OPPONENTS FOR GIVING US A GLIMPSE AS TO WHAT THE COUNTER ARGUMENTS ARE BUT I JUST WANT TO BE LABOR ONE SPECIFIC UP RIGHT HERE IN THE RESOLUTION ALSO CALLED OUT BY SENATOR UMBERG BUT CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY RECOGNIZES THAT PERFORMING THIS TYPE OF CONVERSION THERAPY. ON YOUNG PERSONS IS INEFFECTIVE AN ETHICAL AND HARMFUL SO THIS IN ISN'T OUT OF OUR WHEEL HOUSE TO BE ADDING THIS ADDITIONAL RESOLUTION THAT WOULD INCLUDE YOU KNOW THIS ALL OF THE ITEMS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY WELL JUST A BELIEVER THAT POINT THAT WE ALREADY RECOGNIZING THIS UP FIRST AND SECONDLY AS YOU READ THE ANALYSIS. ISN'T SO MUCH AN ISSUE OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH AS IT IS ON ON PROFESSIONAL CON. AS RIGHT HERE IN THE- IN THE RESPONSE TO THIS TYPE OF THERAPY OVERALL. SO WE'RE NOT. IMPEDING ON ANY OF THAT WHATSOEVER AND FUNDS FREE SPEECH AS WE ARE AN UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT AND I WOULD JUST SAY. I HOPE. OVERALL THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE. THESE DISCUSSIONS AND THAT WE CAN FORMALLY HAVE A CONVERSION THERAPY IN MY OPINION COMPLETELY OUT OF OUR- WE'LL HOUSE THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS WHAT WE BELIEVE AND I BELIEVE THERE REALLY. CALIFORNIA VALUES SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR DOOR ALSO FOLLOW BY STATE OR MONNING. THERE'S TWO ISSUES ONE IS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE PROTECT OF THE FREEDOM. OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. TO BE TREATED WITH THE RESPECT AND NOT TO FEEL THAT THEY ARE ISOLATED THAT THEY ARE IN DANGER. PARTICULARLY ARE MINORS I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO AS GOVERNMENT TO GET INVOLVED WITH. SO THAT'S ONE ARE TO BE TREATED WITH THE RESPECT AND THE DIGNITY OF ALL EIGHT EACH INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEING. THERE'S ALSO A SECOND WHICH IS PUBLIC SAFETY AND THAT IS ALSO VERY MUCH WITHIN THE SCOPE OF GOVERNMENT SO I GUESS I'D LIKE TO ASK. BECAUSE I TO LIKE OTHERS DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS BUT IF THERE'S A SHORT ANSWER TO. THE PUBLIC SAFETY. ASPECT A WHICH IS AGAIN VERY MUCH WITHIN THE SCOPE OF GOVERNMENT IF ANY ONE OF THE PROPONENTS COULD. NOT TALK ABOUT THAT. I MEAN I THINK ONE OF THE RATIONALES FOR THE BILL THAT WAS BROUGHT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AS WELL AS WHAT'S BEHIND THE RESOLUTION IS THE FACT THAT THESE. PRACTICES HAVE BEEN FOUND BY ALL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS AS BEING HARMFUL TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ENGAGED IN THEM THAT IT RESULTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM HIGH RATES OF DEPRESSION AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THE MEDICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERTS HAVE FOUND. YOU KNOW THIS RESOLUTION IS ONE THAT I THINK CALLS ON. EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA TO THINK ABOUT THE WAY THEY ARE CONDUCTING THEIR ACTIVITIES AND HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND LEARN ABOUT PRACTICES THAT BABY CONVERSION THERAPY OR MAY BE LIKE A CONVERSION THERAPY AND THINK ABOUT THE HARM THAT IT HAS AS THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES IT IS A RESOLUTION. AND I THINK THE ORIGINAL BILL AND ACTION RELATED TO CONVERSION THERAPY IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THESE HAVE FOUND HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE HELPFUL I HAVE THE TWO OF THEM FOUND TO BE HARMFUL AND GOVERNMENT HAS. A ROLE IN PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM HARM JUST AS IT DOES IT CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THOSE KINDS OF LOS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THOSE OF THE TWO ISSUES THAT BRING ME TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU ALL FOR. YOUR WORK AND YOUR WOMAN IT SHOULD MAKE NO YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ASKED THE QUESTION SENATOR MORNING YOUR NEXT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I TO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN. PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS FOR SHARING YOUR VIEWS. IN I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE. THE INTERPRETATION THEN I HAVE OF THIS RESOLUTION. IN NO WAY SEEKS TO VIOLATE. THE PRACTICE OF RELIGION OR THE PRIVACY IN CONSULTATION. IN COUNSELING SESSIONS OR THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THOSE COUNSELING SESSIONS. WHAT IT DOES DO IS ENCOURAGE STRONGLY THAT CONVERSION THERAPY NOT BE A COMPONENT OF THAT COUNSELING BECAUSE OF WHAT SCIENCE HAS FOUND TO BE POTENTIALLY DAMAGING AND I THINK WITH RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUES QUESTION THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN IS THAT DAMAGE CAN LEAD TO ATTEMPTED SUICIDE MENTAL HEALTH. CHALLENGES AND DISORDERS WHICH DO BECOME A STATE OF CALIFORNIA INTEREST IF WE'RE PAYING THE BILL FOR THOSE TREATMENTS OM RESPONSES PUBLIC SAFETY REACTIONS FIRST RESPONDER REACTIONS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE MAYBE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO PURSUE A PATH THAT AGAIN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE. THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION HAVEN'T SPECULATED THEY HAVE FOUND AND DOCUMENTED HARMFUL IMPACTS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PROTECT THE PUBLIC SAFETY WITH ABSOLUTE RESPECT FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THOSE COUNSELING SESSIONS. AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME IN WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORFOR ADVANCING THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR STERN YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. I DID WANT TO GIVE THE OPPONENTS A QUICK OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC SAFETY COMMENTS BECAUSE THEY DO. BELIEVE THAT MISTER MORALES IN HIS OPENING COMMENTS DID MENTION SCIENCE. AS PART OF HIS COMMENTS AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU HAD. AS AND LET ME CARRY OUT CONDITION MY QUESTION WITH THAT. I RECOGNIZE AND ADMIT THAT THE FAITH COMMUNITY HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN GOOD ACTORS IN THIS ARENA. THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY IN IN EVERY ARENA OF AMERICAN DEBATE THERE'S GOOD ACTORS AND BAD ACTORS AND PEOPLE THAT MAKE POSITIVE STEPS AND PEOPLE WHO MAKE NEGATIVE STEPS AND HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT. ON OUR CULTURE. ASSEMBLYMAN LOW HAS WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS ON HIS IT LEGISLATION ON THIS ACR I THINK. I CAN CREDIT HIM MORE THAN ANYBODY I KNOW OF IN CALIFORNIA FOR BREAKING DOWN THE WALL OF TENSION BETWEEN THE LGBT COMMUNITY AND THE CHURCH. AND PEOPLE OF FAITH AS I KNOW HE HAS BUILT VERY POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH A MANY PASTORS THAT I KNOW PERSONALLY AND HE'S WORKED VERY HARD AND I THINK HE'S DEMONSTRATED THE LOVE AND COMPASSION THAT THAT HE'S EXPRESSING HERE IN HIS ACR BUT WE ARE DEBATING THE LANGUAGE OF THE SEA ARE TODAY. AND IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP THE SCIENCE AND THE AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY SO I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO GIVE THE PART OF THE OPPONENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER TO THAT IF THEY HAVE AN ANSWER THEY DON'T THAT'S FINE TOO. MY OPPOSITION TO THESE SHARON MEANS THE SAME I'M CONCERNED WITH THAT PARTICULAR LANGUAGE IN THAT PARAGRAPH. BUT WITH THAT'LL YOU'LL TO THE OPPONENTS TO ANSWER TO THOSE TWO QUESTIONS SO THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ARE THE WHOLE ISSUE THE CLAIM SAID SCIENCE AND MEDICINE. INDICATE THAT THERE IS A DUBBED OR DEMONIC SIR DISAGREES WITH THE NOTION THAT THE THERAPY WORKS AND YOU'D LIKE A RESPONSE ON THAT ISSUE THE TWO THINGS THAT THE PROPONENTS FOR ABLE TO ANSWER TO WAS THE SCIENCE IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT. THE I'D LIKE TO HAVE THE POINTS HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY GOOD. THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK YOU. I AM A CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEY WHO PRACTICES IF YOU IS TO BRING COURT I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THE SCIENCE BUT I HAVE REVIEWED SOME OF THE SCIENCE AND READ ARTICLES ABOUT IT. AND. IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR TO BLAME THE FAITH COMMUNITY. FOR THE POOR MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AND ALL THE STIGMA AND PROBLEMS RELATE IN SUICIDE RATES RELATED TO LGBT ISSUES THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES GOING ON THERE BESIDES FAITH PEOPLE'S STIGMA OR OR PERCEIVED STIGMA. HOWEVER IN MY AREA OF EXPERTISE THOUGH IT IT IS THE PICK UP CASE WHICH WAS REFERRED TO EARLIER I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS. AND THAT THE PICK UP CASE WAS THE CASE WITH THAT WENT TO THE NINTH CIRCUIT ABOUT THE MINOR. THE MINOR CONVERSION THERAPY BAD IT WAS UP HELD AT THE NINTH CIRCUIT. AND IF THE ROOF THE ONLY REASON IT WAS UP HELD AT THE NINTH CIRCUIT IS BECAUSE OF THIS PROFESSIONAL SPEECH EXCEPTION. AND IN THE COURTS AND WILL NORMALLY WE WOULD ALLOW YOU TO REGULATE THE SPEECH HERE OF PSYCHOLOGISTS OR PSYCHIATRISTS COUNSELLING MINOR. BUT WE WERE GONNA RECOGNIZE THIS NOVEL PROFESSIONAL SPEECH EXCEPTION. THE PROBLEM WITH. RELYING ON THE PICK UP CASE WHICH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS DID. THAT I READ LATE LAST NIGHT FOR TODAY. IS THAT THE PICKUP CASE HAS PENNED OVER RULED BY THE CASE I CITED EARLIER WHICH ISN'T A FLOOD VERSUS THE SERRA. ON THE BIGGER CASE WASN'T SPECIFICALLY OVERRULED BUT THE WHOLE REASON FOR WHICH WHICH WAS A PROFESSIONAL SPEECH EXCEPTION TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS. WAS OVER RULED AND SO. MY GREAT CONCERN HERE TODAY IS I'VE HEARD VERY LITTLE CONCERNED EXCEPT FROM A FEW OF THE SENATORS. ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND ABOUT THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH WHAT WE SEEM VERY. EAGER IN THE NAME OF PUBLIC SAFETY. OR PERCEIVED THREATS TO PUBLIC SAFETY TO KIND OF DO AWAY WITH THE FIRST AMENDMENT. IF WE DO AWAY WITH THE FIRST AMENDMENT FOLKS ALL OF OUR FREEDOMS GO OUT THE DOOR. AND SO WE'VE GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE USE PUBLIC SAFETY. ARGUMENTS AND SMASHED THE FIRST AMENDMENT CALIFORNIA WAS BROUGHT UP SHORT INITIAL VERSES Và SERRA. AND THEY HAD TO PAY OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN ATTORNEY'S FEES I WAS CO COUNSEL AT THE US SUPREME COURT AND IF A PERSON TO SERRA. AND THE IN THE LETTER I SUBMITTED TO THIS COMMITTEE. THE COURT VERY CLEARLY SAID IT IS IN A CONCURRING OPINION BY JUSTICE KENNEDY YOU JUST RETIRED HE SAID IT IS NOT FORWARD THINKING TO FORCE INDIVIDUALS TO BE AN INSTRUMENT FOR FOSTERING PUBLIC ADHERENCE WHO'D IDEOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW THEY FIND UNACCEPTABLE. ITIS FORWARD THINKING TO BEGIN BY READING THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS RATIFIED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. TO AND SORRY SEVENTEEN NINETY ONE TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY OF AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT AS THE FOUNDERS THEN NEW IT TO CONFIRM THE HISTORY SINCE THEN SHOWS HOW RELENTLESS AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES ARE. IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO STIFLE FREE SPEECH IN THE KERRY THOSE LESSONS ON WORD AS WE SEEK TO PRESERVE AND TEACH THE NECESSITY OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH. FOR THE GENERATIONS TO COME A CONCLUDE WITH THIS GOVERNMENTS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO FORCE PERSONS TO EXPRESS A MESSAGE CONTRARY TO THEIR DEEPEST CONVICTIONS. FREEDOM OF SPEECH SECURE IS THE FREEDOM OF THOUGHT AND BELIEF THIS LAW AND PERILS THOSE LIBERTIES ACR NINETY NINE IN PERILS THOSE LIBERTIES SO DO NOT PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE FIRST AMENDMENT LIGHTLY. THANK YOU AND I WOULD JUST SIMPLY ADD THIS COMMITTEE DOESN'T TAKE THE FIRST MEMBER LIGHTLY WE'VE HEARD FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT GROUPS THOSE INCLUDING WHO WANT TO SPEAK AT BERKELEY AND HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT. THE PROTECTIONS TO THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT THAT HAVE HAD SOMEWHAT INCENDIARY SPEECH IN THIS COMMITTEE HAS CONFIRM THEIR RIGHT TO HAVE THAT SPEECH SO THAT IS A POINT THAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT TO I THINK WE ALL HOLD DEAR. I THINK WE DISAGREE WITH YOU ONE WHETHER THIS IS AN ATTACK ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT OR WHETHER RICHEST SIMPLY URGES THROUGH THE SCIENCE WHICH- APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND THE ISSUE OF. A SCIENCE AND MEDICINE ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF THIS TYPE OF COULDN'T CONVERSION THERAPY AGAIN IS THE CENTER ON BURKE MENTIONED IT TALKS ABOUT COMING FROM A PLACE OF LOVE WHICH I BELIEVE IS WHAT THE CHURCH ESPOUSES. IT DOESN'T MANDATE THAT YOU DO ANY PARTICULAR THING IT IS I THINK MORE IN THE SPIRIT AND ASKING THAT YOU CONSIDER THAT. AS YOU GO FORWARD TO CONSIDER THE SCIENCE AND WHAT HAVE. AS A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW EXPERT I THNK YOU'LL HAVE TO AGREE THAT THE DEFINITIONS OF FIRST AMENDMENT VIS A VIS RELIGION. HAVE BEEN SORT OF TURNING ON THEIR HEAD A LITTLE BIT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS SO IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW THIS IS INTERPRETED GOING FOR THE FIRST AMENDMENT ENDS VIS A VIS RELIGION IS BEING INTERPRETED GOING FORWARD. BUT AGAIN THE FIRST MAMMAL LIKE ALL AMENDMENTS IS NOT. ABSOLUTE AND I DON'T THINK THOUGH THAT EVEN IN THIS CASE WE ARE WE ARE AT A POINT OF MANDATING WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO WHAT YOU. CAN AND CANNOT THINK BUT IT DOES A TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE IT DOES TALK ABOUT IMPACTS. ENDED ASK THAT YOU COME FROM A PLACE OF AND- SO I DIE I APPRECIATE IS A FIRST AMENDMENT LAWYER. BUT I DON'T THINK THERE THAT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THAT POINT WHERE WE REALLY ARE IMPOSING IN ANYWAY ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT SO WANT TO BE THAT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR AS THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO RESPOND BRIEFLY PLEASE FEEL FREE. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF THREE JONES FOR THAT QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO THE CONVERSION THERAPY IN PREPARATION FOR THIS NOT BEING VERY FAMILIAR WITH IT MYSELF. I TALKED TO A- COLLEAGUE OF MINE WHO IS. AN AFRICAN AMERICAN FEMALE WHO IS A BOARD CERTIFIED MEDICAL PHYSICIAN. AND A FORMER PRACTICING LESBIAN. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND CONVERSION THERAPY. AND SO. I DO NOT STAND HERE CITY ARRESTED REPRESENTATIVE. ADVOCATING FOR ANYTHING THAT WOULD DEVALUE. DE HUMANIZED ANYONE OR WOULD MAKE THEM FEEL LESS THAN THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE ABOUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M ABOUT JESUS ABOUT LOVE AND SO. ANY KIND OF THERAPY. THAT WOULD SEEK TO SAY YOU'RE A BAD PERSON YOU ARE WRONG PERSON OR AGAIN DE VALUE YOU IS THAT WHAT WE'RE ADVOCATING FOR BUT WE ARE ADVOCATING OR WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS THE LANGUAGE WHICH WAS SO ELOQUENTLY CALLED OUT THAT WOULD PROHIBIT MY ABILITY AS A PASTOR MY COLLEAGUES ABILITY AS A PASTOR RELATIVE TO MEDICAL SCIENCE. FROM SOMEONE'S OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM TO SAY. IF I WANT TO SEEK THERAPEUTIC COUNSELING THAT IF THEY LEGAL THAT VALUES ME AS AN INDIVIDUAL. IF I WANT TO SPEAK TRANSFORMATIVE COUNSELING THROUGH A CHRISTIAN COUNSELOR THAT I SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO DO SO MY THING WOULD BE LIST JUST TAKE THAT ONE SECTION OUT OF A R. C. NINETY NINE AND I THINK WE'LL BE ALL SET. THANK YOU I DO THINK THOUGH. NOTHING IS PROHIBITED IN THIS. RESOLUTION IT. IT'S SIMPLY AN ENCOURAGEMENT. A STATEMENT TO COUNSEL WITH LOVE IN A KNOWLEDGE OF THE OVERWHELMING SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS WHICH I DON'T THINK HAS BEEN REFUTED HERE I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN ANY EXPERTS COMING IN TO SAY THIS THE SCIENCE IS NOT REAL. DATA AGAIN SIMPLY ASKED FOR A COMING FROM A PLACE OF LOVE IN KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS OF CONCERN SO OF DON'T THINK IT IMPEDES ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT YOU KNOW MAYBE WRONG MAYBE THEY'LL GIVE YOU SOME MORE BUSINESS TO KEEP YOU BUSY BUT I THINK AT THIS POINT IN TIME LIST FOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WE HAVE A MOTION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW WOULD YOU LIKE DID YOU WANT TO SPEAK CENTER STERN.NO OKAY IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COLLEAGUES FOR THE OPTION TO SPEAK ON THIS JUST FOR CONTEXT BECAUSE IT TEARS THAT NUMBER OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESS ONE HERE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR FOR ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THE STATE MADE A STRONG STATEMENT THAT WE SAID YES THERE'S A HARMFUL PRACTICE OF CONVERSION THEIR FREE FOR MINORS EIGHTEEN AND UNDER THAT IS THE LAW OF THE LAND THAT HAS BEEN UP HEALTH. MULTIPLE TIMES SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHICH BY THE WAY FIFTEEN OTHER STATES HAVE ALSO SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE ALSO PASSED SIMILAR TYPES OF LEGISLATION RECOGNIZING THE SIGNS. OF ALL OF THESE OTHER SO STATIONS. LAST YEAR THEN WE SAID WELL WE WANT TO PROTECT ALL PEOPLE NOT JUST MINORS AND THAT'S WHY WE NEARLY. FOCUSING TAILORED ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE LAST YEAR. ON CONVERSION THERAPY AS A FRAUDULENT PRACTICE WHICH IS THAT IF THERE'S A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A FRAUDULENT PRACTICE BUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TESTIFIED HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION WOULD STILL BE A LATE ABLE. TO PRACTICE THE CONVERSION THERAPY SHOULD THEY- SHOULD THEY WISH TO DO SO. SO LONG AS AN THERE'S NOT THAT FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION PASSED BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. BUT IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE ALSO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH. EVANGELICAL LEADERS BECAUSE I THOUGHT IS VERY IMPORTANT. TO ENCOURAGE THAT TYPE OF. A STRONGER APPROACH IN INCORPORATING MADE A DIFFERENT VALUES OF ALL PEOPLE. YOU CAN AMASS AN- MIKE SAID THE ANGST OF OUR SPONSORS AND FRANKLY OF. THE QUALITY CALIFORNIA WE PAUSED IN I HELD THAT BILL. IT WAS READY TO GO TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK FOR SENATOR BE HELD THAT BILL SAID WHY. THE CALL CALIFORNIA SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING. I SAID I WANT TO PAUSE BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER I THINK WE CAN BE TRANSFORMATIVE IN THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE AS A RESULT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE FORTY THREE OF A FRAUDULENT PRACTICE CONVERSION THERAPY AS A FRONT IN PRACTICE. I NEVER OF FAITH LEADERS SAID WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH YOU BUT WE THINK THIS GOES JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR TO COULD WE WORK TOGETHER WITH YOU AND COMING UP WITH SOME LANGUAGE. SO WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY. IN CAPS LATE THE WORK. PARTNERSHIP COUNTER TO WHAT YOU HEARD FROM TESTIMONY IS ACTUALLY CONTRARY TO THAT IN FACT THIS WAS DONE IN COLLABORATION WITH FAITH LEADERS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE TO WHICH I KNOW SENATOR JONES KNOWS I HAVE TRAVELED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE TO MEET WITH EVANGELICAL LEADERS TO GET THEIR SUPPORT ON THIS PIECE OF RESOLUTION INCLUDE INCLUDING KEVIN MANILA THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EVANGELICALS SO AGAIN WOULD YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU HERE. IS THE WORK OF A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH WITH MEMBERS OF THE FAITH COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE TO SAY WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH YOU AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN BUILD OFF OF THIS WORKING RELATIONSHIP TO IDENTIFY HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY MOVING FORWARD FROM A PLACE OF LOVE COMPASSION AND RECOGNIZING ALL PEOPLE LET ME JUST FINALLY JUST SAY THAT THAT. THIS IS A NON BINDING RESOLUTION. THIS IS A NON BINDING RESOLUTION. SO THE OPPOSITION WAS OPPOSE LAST TIME. IN WHICH THEY WERE NOT NECESSARILY AT THE TABLE AND IT WAS NEARLY SCOPE TO FINANCIAL TRANSACTION UNDER THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT VERY NARROW IN SCOPE. AND YET EVEN WITH EVANGELICAL LEADERS THEY'RE STILL OPPOSED SOME SOME ARE STILL OPPOSE. SO IT'S JUST VERY CLEAR TO ME THAT THERE WILL BE A CONVERSATION OF A DIFFERENCE OF THIS I'M SURE THE OPPOSITION WOULD STILL BE OPPOSED AMERICA QUALITY OR MY OPPORTUNITY TO ADOPT OR TO DONATE BLOOD TO BE PART OF THE BOY SCOUTS ARE TO SERVE A MILITARY. WE'VE ALREADY SETTLED THIS. BUT AGAIN WHAT YOU SEE HERE BEFORE YOU IS A COLLABORATION OF THE WORK THAT I THINK I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN BE. WE CAN STAND ON THIS IN A TRANSFORMATIVE WAY TO SAY THAT WE STAND TOGETHER AND UNITED IN THESE EFFORTS AND BUILD OFF OF THIS AS WELL BUT AGAIN THIS NOTION OF CONVERSION THERAPY IS THE ANTI FEDERAL TO MY VERY EXISTENCE THIS NOTION. THAT ONE COULD BE CHANGED. IS DAMAGING TO ALL PEOPLE THAT SOMEHOW WE SHOULD BE CHANGED OR IF WE SHOULD SEEK THIS OUT RATHER WE SHOULD BE ACCEPTED. AND SO THIS STATEMENT OF AFFIRMATION IS OF LOVE AND COMPASSION AND RESPECTFULLY ASK DR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL DEBATE HAVING SEIZED PLEASE CALL THE ROLL LEAH MOTION IS. THE MET ITEM BE IT ADOPTED AS AMENDED PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE BORDERS OR JUST NO DO RUSSELL RUSSELL I GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I JONES JONES NO MONNING MONEY AYE STERN STERN I BURKE.

LARA SHORES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOUR COMMITTEE SENATOR FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. HR NINETEEN CALLS UPON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RESET ALL THE THIRTY THOUSAND REFUGEES OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE COMMITTED TO RESETTLE IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN. AS YOU ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA'S LONG BEEN A WELCOMING HOME FOR REFUGEES RESETTLED INTO OUR COMMUNITIES REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT THE REQUIRES ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS TO WORK TOGETHER. SO IT'S OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT EVERYONE COMES TOGETHER IN UNITED FRONT TO RESETTLE REFUGEES HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE IN RECENT YEARS CERTAINLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS DRASTICALLY CUT THE INCLINATION OF NET REFUGEE ARRIVALS AND EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED ALMOST HALF OF THE REFUGEE RESELLERS SPOTS. AVAILABLE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. IT'S IS WELCOME FEWER THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND REFUGEES SO FAR. WE ARE MORE THAN HALFWAY THROUGH THE YEAR. AT THIS RATE THE ADMINISTRATION WILL COME NOWHERE NEAR RESETTLING ITS GOAL OF THIRTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. A GOAL% WHICH PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE HISTORIC AVERAGE COMMITMENT OF NINETY FIVE THOUSAND REFUGEES ANNUALLY. CONGRESS AND OF BEEN THE PRESIDENT HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE TO STAND BEHIND THIS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE POPULATION. AS WE HAVE DONE FOR SO MANY YEARS IN THE PAST WITH ME TODAY ARE CATCHING WITH A COMMUNITY ADVOCACY RAP FOR THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE. OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS DATA BOSTON BOSTON AS A QUé ALL CLOSE. I DID I GET IT YEAH AND I DIDN'T IS AGAIN THE ASSEMBLY SUCH A REFUGEE VOICE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE. I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE MANAGER. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU TWO MINUTES PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE ARE ON THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION BE A PART OF IT TODAY. MY NAME IS KATE CHIANG AND I'M AN ADVOCATE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE. AT THE I RC IS A REFUGEE. AID AND RESETTLEMENT AGENCY THAT OPERATES INTERNATIONALLY. HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SEVEN DIFFERENT OFFICES AND WE'VE WORKED HERE PROVIDING RESETTLEMENT SERVICES FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS. OUR WORK INVOLVES PROVIDING THE NECESSARY SERVICES TO ENSURE AN EFFECTIVE AND PRODUCTIVE RESETTLEMENT FOR NEWLY ARRIVED REFUGEES INCLUDES THINGS LIKE. CULTURAL ORIENTATION HOUSING JOB PLACEMENT INCLUDE ENGLISH LANGUAGE EDUCATION AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NOT TO MENTION GETTING KIDS ENROLLED IN SCHOOL GETTING FOLKS SET UP WITH HEALTHCARE. I'M AND JOB TRAINING IN ADDITION TO BASIC PLACEMENT. OVER THE DECADES THAT WE HAVE WORKED HERE WE HAVE WATCH THOUSANDS OF CLIENTS. REBUILD THEIR LIVES WITH IMPRESSIVE RESILIENCE TO BECOME INVESTED AN INTEGRAL MEMBERS OF THEIR NEW COMMUNITIES. BUT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE NUMBERS OF REFUGEE ARRIVALS HAVE BEEN SLASHED AND THAT HAS CAUSED ACUTE PAIN. INCLUDING THE CLOSURE OF OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE WHICH PROVIDE CONTINUING SERVICES TO FOLKS FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS AFTER THEY ARRIVE. BUT THESE LOW ARRIVALS ARE NOT DUE TO A LACK OF NEED ON THE CONTRARY THE NEED FOR STATE THIRD PARTY RESETTLEMENT IN THE GLOBE HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER. AND THIS LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY POWERFUL ALLY PASSING KEY LEGISLATION OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA REMAINS A FOR FIND LOCATION FOR REFUGEES TO COME TO OBTAIN EMPLOYMENT AND TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFULLY. AS WE APPROACH THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY WE AWAIT NEWS OF WITH HEWLETT ADMISSIONS LEVELS WILL BE THIS YEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT. BUT WE HAVE HEARD AND SEEN REPORTS THAT THE PROGRAM COULD BE COMPLETELY DISMANTLED. THAT WOULD BE AS ASSEMBLYMAN GLORIA SAID A SIEVE SIGNIFICANT DEVIATION FROM HISTORICAL AVERAGE NINETY FIVE THOUSAND REFUGEES THE UNITED STATES HAS RESETTLED ANNUALLY SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY. AND I KEY HISTORICAL MARKER WHICH HAS ENJOYED BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THAT ENTIRE PERIOD OF TIME. SO RESOLUTIONS LIKE AJ ARE NINETEEN ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO EXHIBIT STRONG SUPPORT FOR REFUGEES AND REFLECT THE VALUES AND THE PRIORITIES OF OUR GREAT STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TWO MINUTES PLEASE OUR HELLO MY NAME IS THE NUMBER STAND SICK AND I'M THE REFUGEE VOICE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND I'M REALLY HONORED TO BE HERE IN THIS PLACE OF DEMOCRACY TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF H. A R. NINETEEN WHICH DOES NOT ON THE EXTEND SUPPORT AND WELCOME TO THE REFUGEES BEING VERSATILE AND CALIFORNIA. BUT ALSO CALLS UPON THE ADMINISTRATION TO INCREASE THE NUMBERS OFF THE ADMISSIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY MUCH MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT NOW. I HAVE A FEELING WE HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY REMINDED THAT REFUGEES TO NOT ARE NOT ACTUALLY LEAVING THEIR PLACES BY CHOICE. REFUGEES ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE FLEEING PERSECUTION AND WAR. ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS SINCE I HAVE BEEN RECYCLED FROM BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA AS A REFUGEE. I STILL VIVIDLY CARRY. WITH ME THE MEMORIES OF THE DAY WHEN I WAS FORCED TO LEAVE. THAT WAS THE DAY WHEN WOMEN AND YOUNG GIRLS WERE TAKEN TO THE CONCENTRATION CAMP A PLACE OF TORTURE AND DEATH. I WAS REALLY I'M SO HAPPY THAT I WAS THE LUCKY ONE OR ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES TO ESCAPE AND I WAS ABLE TO BE RESETTLED HERE IN CALIFORNIA I FOUND MY NEW HOME HERE AND CALIFORNIA. AND I STARTED MY LIFE A NEW AGAIN AND FROM THE VERY FIRST MOMENT I HAVE FELT ACCEPTED. I HAVE STARTED WORKING IMMEDIATELY I'VE NEVER BEEN BURDEN TO THIS SOCIETY I'VE STARTED WORKING FOR THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE HELPING OTHER REFUGEES START THEIR NEW LIFE AND FREEDOM. AND BASICALLY I'M SO HAPPY THAT CALIFORNIA IS STILL FOLLOWING THE HISTORICAL ROLE OF BEING THE LEADER OF THE REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT AND BEING THE WELCOMING PLACE AND I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF. AJ ARE NINETEEN AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE ARE SOME OF US HERE REMEMBER THE BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA. CHALLENGES THAT I THINK ARE STILL GOING ON. SO THANK YOU WELCOME. ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES HERE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS. SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU ARE BIGGER BRING THIS ITEM FORD I JUST HAVE A QUESTION WE'RE REFERRING TO THESE INDIVIDUALS AS AS REFUGEES BUT LIKE FROM A LEGAL CONTEXT ARE THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE NOT YET BEEN. PROCESSED IN BEEN GRANTED ASYLUM. OKAY SO M. THE WAY THAT THE PROCESSING AND RESETTLEMENT SYSTEM WORKS IS THAT THERE ARE ROUGHLY TWENTY SIX MILLION REFUGEES IN THE WORLD TODAY AND THAT'S A SPECIFIC INTERNATIONAL LEGAL DEFINITION SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN. FORCED TO FLEE ACROSS AN INTERNATIONAL BORDER DUE TO FEAR OF PERSECUTION OR DEATH BECAUSE OF MEMBERSHIP IN ONE OF FIVE PROTECTED CLASS YOU'RE STRAIGHT. I'M HEY ACROSS THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER REFUGEES CAN APPLY THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS THE UNHCR FOR RESETTLEMENT. I'M IT IS SOMETHING THAT GENERALLY LESS THAN 1% OF THE REFUGEE POPULATION EVER HAS ACCESS TO. AND THE UNITED STATES HAS AGREED TO BE ONE OF ROUGHLY TWENTY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD WHO HAS AGREED TO VOLUNTARILY ACCEPT. AND RESETTLE THOSE REFUGEES WHO APPLY FOR RESETTLEMENT GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND ARE SELECTED OKAY BUT GOING THROUGH THE U. N. RIGHT. SO THIS IS NOT. AS A SCENARIO WHERE WE'VE EXPERIENCE ON THE NORTHERN OR SOUTHERN SIDE. YEAH THIS WAS THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL REPLACEMENT PROGRAM PLACEMENT PROGRAM. IF THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY SO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT GET RESETTLED. BALLOTS FOR USE THE US FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE ACCEPTED THEM AS REFUGEES OR WE HAVE ACCEPTED THEM. AND GIVEN THEM ASYLUM STATUS. RIGHT TO THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IS THE REFUGEES APPLY THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE UNITED STATES WORKS WITH THE U. NH C. R. AND THEY'RE ROUGHLY NINE FEDERAL AGENCIES. PART OF HOMELAND SECURITY STATE DEPARTMENT AMONG OTHERS THAT WORK TO VET THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE APPLIED IT ROUGHLY TAKES ABOUT THREE YEARS. FOR THE RESETTLEMENT DECISION TO BE MADE. THEN THEY ARE ACCEPTED IN EVERY YEAR THE PRESIDENT SETS A C. ON HER YEAH RIGHT OF HOW MANY. OF THOSE FOLKS WE WILL ACCEPT TO RESETTLE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES HISTORICALLY AS THE SOMEONE SAID IT'S BEEN NINETY FIVE THOUSAND SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ROUGHLY. LAST YEAR WAS DROPPED TO FORTY FIVE THOUSAND IN THIS. YEAR WAS SET FOR THIRTY THOUSAND. AND THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE ACCEPTED THROUGH THE DIFFERENT FEDERAL AGENCIES AND ONCE THE AGREEMENT IS MADE. THEY ARE THEN ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THE NINE RESETTLEMENT AGENCIES THAT WORK IN THE UNITED STATES SO THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE IS ONE OF THOSE NINE RESETTLEMENT AGENCIES. WE GET WORD THAT THEY ARE COMING AND WE WORK WITH THEM WITH CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO ESTABLISH HOUSING JOB PLEASE. YES WHAT IS THEIR STATUS UPON ENTRY INTO THEIR STATUS IS THAT OF A REFUGEE. THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL OFFICE OF MIGRATION BUT HAVE THEY BEEN GRANTED ASYLUM BY THE U. S. UPON. ENTRY INTO THE US AT NO THEY'RE CC THEY'RE CONSIDERED REFUGEES ASIDE THESE YET THE DEFINITIONS DIFFERENCE ON A SLIGHTLY. THE DEFINITION IS ROUGHLY THE SAME IN TERMS OF THE PROTECTED CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE BUT A SIDE OF THESE ARE FOLKS. WHO CROSSED INTO OUR COUNTRY ACROSS ONE OF THE BORDERS AND PERCENT PRESENT THEMSELVES TO OUR BORDER SECURITY AGENCIES. AND SAY I AM HERE TO REQUEST ASYLUM. REFUGEES ARE FOLKS WHO ARE RECOGNIZED THROUGH THE UNITED NATIONS AND GOT IT PROCESS AS A REFUGEE THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. I THINK THAT. THIS IS THIS IS A PROCESS. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF VETTING THAT GOES INTO THIS PROCESS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT IS ONE THAT IS AGREED UPON BY THE UNITED STATES IN PARTICIPATION WITH THIS PROGRAM THAT THAT'S CORRECT YES. WE HAVE A HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY OF WELCOMING INDIVIDUALS IN TIMES OF NEED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WHAT QUESTIONS OTHER QUESTIONS CENTER DRAWS SO DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION. YOU WANT TO MOVE THE BILL AS AMENDED. YES ALRIGHT THE- BUT I JUST WANNA SAY COUPLE OF THINGS I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE PARTICULAR. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASYLUM AND IN REFUGEE UP BUT IT SEEMS TO ME WHAT WE SEEM TO KEEP CONTINUES TO GO THROUGH GENERATION PAST GENERATION IS TO FORGET THE PREVIOUS GENERATIONS GROUP. OF REFUGEES. AND IT DEPENDS ON WHERE THEY COME FROM. CRITICALLY THAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW OUR GOVERNMENT USES TO DECIDE IF THEY'RE GONNA EXCEPT THE MORE OR NOT ACCEPT THEM SO THERE WAS A DIFFERENT POLICY USE WITH CUBANS AND WITH VIETNAMESE AND WITH OTHER COUNTRIES OF FROM. GET OUT THEY'RE JUST DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THIS GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO ACCEPT REFUGEES ARE NOT ACCEPT REFUGEES CENTRAL AMERICANS FELL THE DORIANS BECAUSE OF THE WAR. SO YOU KNOW MY CONCERN IS THAT AND THE REASON I'M SUPPORTING THIS IS BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE A SYSTEM. I UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN TAKE TWENTY ONE MILLION OF PEOPLE BUT WE CERTAINLY SHOULD HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS BASED ON THE NEED IN THAT COUNTRY AND THERE'S REAL HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IT'S TAKING PLACE IN THESE COUNTRIES AND WE SHOULD NOT FORGET THE PAST GENERATIONS THE HUNGARIANS THE- JEWISH THE IRISH THERE WERE ALL THESE. TIMES THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS THAT HAVE THEIR GROUPS AND WE JUST SEEM TO GO THROUGH THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH THE CURRENT REFUGEE SO. YOU KNOW I SUPPORT THIS BUT IT'S GOT TO BE PUT IN A BROADER CONTEXT AND SORT OF THE LEGAL. LEGAL DIFFERENCES ON AND THAT'S WHY CALIFORNIA'S GOTTA KEEP INSISTING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A FAIR REFUGEE POLICY AND NOT ONE THAT YOU KNOW WE WITH WHEN WE DECIDE THIS IT'S LIFE AND DEATH FOR THE THOSE FAMILIES WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND SOMEHOW WE JUST LOSE IT LOSE THAT PERSPECTIVE SO THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS SENATOR JONES. AFTER A QUICK QUESTION AB TWO QUESTIONS I THINK YOU CAN ANSWER TOGETHER. ONE HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE NUMBERS THIRTY THOUSAND AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND. AND TWO ARE THOSE NATIONAL NUMBERS AND YOU'RE WANTING ALL OF ALL THE ALL THE REFUGEES IN AMERICA IT ACCEPTS. THE COME TO CALIFORNIA OR ARE YOU I'M SO TELL ME HOW YOU GOT TO THE NUMBERS PLEASE. SO THIRTY THOUSAND IS WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO BUT IS CLEARLY NOT LIVING UP TO. SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND IS A SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER NUMBER THAN CLOSER TO THE HISTORIC NORMS AND NOW WE'RE NOT SAYING SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR SO FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND FIVE THOUSAND THE NATIONAL. ALL RIGHT OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I TO SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS THE FACT THAT WE ARE VILIFYING IMMIGRANTS TODAY IS UNSETTLING MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM TROUBLED NATIONS ELSEWHERE AROUND THE WORLD THEY'RE DESPERATE. WE KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T LEAVE HOME TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. JUST FOR THE HECK OF IT THEY COME BECAUSE THEY ARE IN FEAR OF THEIR LIVES OR THEY BELIEVE THAT THE OF PROMISE OF GREATER OPPORTUNITY IT'S TRAUMATIC TO LEAVE WHAT YOU'RE NOT WHICH TRAUMATIC I SUSPECT TO LEAVE A COUNTRY WHERE YOU KNOW THE LANGUAGE TO A COUNTRY WHERE YOU DON'T. SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO STOP VILIFYING PEOPLE AND TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE WHO ARE REALLY COMING HERE OF FOR THEIR SAFETY AND SECURITY IN BECAUSE- AS WE SEE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WHETHER IT'S THROUGH FAMINE OR DROUGHT OR- IDEOLOGICAL REASONS OR OR THE KIND OF PROGRAMS THAT BROUGHT MY GRANDPARENTS FROM. EASTERN EUROPE WHERE THE COUNTRY DID A TO SOME EXTENT OPEN ITS BORDERS THAT TO SOME EXTENT IT DIDN'T BUT CERTAINLY A POLICY HUMAN A HUMANISTIC POLICY AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE- OBISPO QUESTION BY SENATOR JONES WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NATION WIDE AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT OPENING OUR BORDERS TO MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BUT TO CONTINUE A POLICY. THAT HAS PROVEN IN THE FACT TO BE FAIRLY EFFECTIVE WELL I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE DESPERATELY SEEKING TO MIGRATE TO OTHER COUNTRIES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. AND THE NEED FOR US TO RE EVALUATE OUR POLICY AND TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE BUILT ON THE NATION'S IMMIGRATION WHETHER IT WAS THE POTATO FARMERS. IN IRELAND TO WHICH REFLECTS SOME OF US HERE. I KNOW MY GRANDFATHER CAME OVER IN A OF A OF FLOOD OF IMMIGRATION INCLUDING GREEKS. SOME OF HIS BEST FRIENDS WERE YOUNG FOLKS FROM FROM GREECE THAT HAD ESCAPED WHATEVER. THE ECONOMIC TRAVAILS WERE EXISTING THEN TO HIS DYING DAYS HE INSISTED UPON DANCING GREEK DANCES FOR SHE WAS NOT VERY GOOD AT IT BUT- BUT CHIPS YOU KNOW AGAIN TO EMBRACE. ALL OF THE WONDERFUL CULTURE SO WE BRING TO THIS COUNTRY SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALSO FOR BRINGING THIS AND WE DO HAVE PROMOTION AS AMENDED IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE SPREADING CATON DINA FOR THEIR TEST FIND SUPPORT WANT TO NOTE FOR THE RECORD THAT EVERY LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS HAS ENDORSED THIS RESOLUTION.
