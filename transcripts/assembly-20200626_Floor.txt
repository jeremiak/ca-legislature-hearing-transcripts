LOCAL RATE ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTY NINE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING AN ACT RELATING TO THE STATE BUDGET MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BUDGET BILL MR TAKE YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM HER PRESENT AB EIGHT NINE WE WERE HERE A WEEK AND A HALF AGO PASSED IN OUR BUDGET BILL. THAT BILL JUST REMIND EVERYBODY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT IN TIMES OF UNCERTAINTY THE WE WERE THERE TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIANS ARE THE MOST CRITICAL SERVICES WHETHER IT WAS EDUCATION WITH HEALTHCARE WEATHER'S HUMAN SERVICES. IF THAT IN TIME SPEND THAT MAKE. THE WE DIDN'T TURN BACKS ON THE- NOW WITH HAVE MADE MORE CALL. IT HAVE A BOAT. THAT WAS BETTER FOR OUR BALL RATING WE DECIDED THAT IT WAS MORE. TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOL. REMAIN HELD HER. USE MORE POOR TO MAKE WE DIDN'T CUT HEALTHCARE OR TOUCH ALL THE FOR THE WITH PROP FIFTY SIX WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE WITH COLORFUL SAFETY FOR PEOPLE WHO WE NEED FOOD WHO NEED CRITICAL SERVICES AT THIS. SO THERE ARE A COUPLE DO. NOW BECAUSE TODAY WE HAVE AGREE WITH THE GUY. AND SO THE MAIN DIFFERENCE THIS BUDGET BILL JUNIOR IS HOW WE DEALT WITH OUR TRIGGER. YOU MIGHT RECALL WE HAD A FEDERAL TRIGGER ASSUMING BUT THE FEDERAL MONEY WAS GOING TO COME AND IF IT DIDN'T COME. THE WE'D HAVE TO DO CUTS. SO WE DON'T DO ANY A SOME SHOWN AROUND FEDERAL FUNDING IN TERMS OF THE MONEY BEING HERE. WHAT IT SAYS IS. THE BUDGET WILL INCREASE ON OCTOBER FIFTEENTH IF WE GET THE FEDERAL FUNDING. AND IT WILL INCREASE TO REDUCE THE PROPERTY TO FOR ALL FOR THE MONEY THAT WE'RE BORROWING FOR SCHOOLS. YOU SEE AND SEE IF YOU'LL GO 5% MORE. FOR ANOTHER HUNDRED AND- MILLION. IT WILL OFFSET THE ALMOST THREE BILLION IN STATE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION CUTS THAT THEY TOOK AT THE BARGAINING TABLE WHETHER TAKING AT THE BARGAINING TABLE A RESTORED MODERNA CAN HOUSING FUNDING AN INFILL GRANTS IT ALSO RETAINS THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER PROGRAM PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION MORNING COUNTY REALIGNMENT BACK FILL FOR A TOTAL OF ONE BILLION TO THE COUNTIES. THAT ALSO FUNDS LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES. AGAIN THIS BUDGET WE COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING THAT WAS BETTER FOR WALL STREET BUTIN THE END WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY GOT TO MAIN STREET SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON A. B. EIGHTY NINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHANG MISTER OBERNOLTE OR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER A COLLEAGUES THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE BUDGET WE'RE CONSIDERING TODAY IS SLIGHTLY. MORE FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE THAN THE ONE WE PASSED LAST WEEK. THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THIS BUDGET IS STILL STRUCTURALLY YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE. THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH ON MAIN STREET AS WELL AS WALL STREET IN THE FUTURE. THE BUDGET WERE VOTING ON TODAY BALANCES REVENUES WITH EXPENDITURE NOT THROUGH REDUCTIONS IN STATE SPENDING BUT INSTEAD. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BUDGETARY GIMMICKS. SUCH AS DEFERRALS. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INTER FUND TRANSFERS AND LOANS AND THE DEPLETION OF OVER HALF OF OUR STATES BUDGETARY RESERVES. I KNOW THE CUTS ARE PAINFUL TO MAKE. BUT OUR FAILURE TO MAKE THOSE DIFFICULT DECISIONS THIS YEAR OR IS GOING TO HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR US. IN FUTURE YEARS. AND I FEAR THAT THE BUDGET THAT WERE PASSING TODAY IS GOING TO MAKE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. TO BALANCE BUDGETS AND AVOID CUTS IN THE FUTURE I ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER REALTY MR FALL IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BUDGET NO MATTER HOW YOU DRESS UP THIS BUDGET WITH RHETORIC THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE IS A FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED BUDGET. IS A BUDGET THAT BECAUSE FOR MORE BORROWING MORE DEFERRALS REALIZE AN ACCOUNTING GIMMICKS AND HOPES AND WISHES FOR THINGS TO COME THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN. IT'S HOPING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL COME AND BAIL US OUT IT WHICH IS A BETTER ECONOMIC FORECAST NUMBERS ARE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE POSITIVE THAN WHAT WAS PRESENTED TO US THERE IS NO WAY TO RESPONSIBLY MANAGE OUR STATE THAT THIS IS NO WAY TO RESPOND TO MANAGE OUR STATE BUDGET. THIS BUDGET IS NOT MAKING THE TOUGH CHOICES WE ALL KNOW WE NEED NEED TO NEED TO BE MADE THE FACT THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL FUNDING IS STILL HAPPENING IN THIS BUDGET SHOULD BE DISCONCERTING TO EVERY TAXPAYER IN THE STATE. ESPECIALLY WITH THE CUTS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED TO OTHER NECESSARY PROGRAMS THE PUBLIC RIGHTFULLY EXPECTS AND DEMANDS FOR US TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS IT'S MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY GIVEN OUR CURRENT BUDGET. YEAH THIS BUDGET. DOES THE OPPOSITE. IT CONTINUES TO FIND WAY FOR PRO. THERE ARE OVER FOR TO MAKE GOVERNMENT MORE EFFICIENT AND IT INCLUDES. A BILLION TAX. WHY ARE WE RAISING TAXES DURING A TIME WHEN BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY TO SURVIVE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS BUDGET DOES NOT MEET THE MOMENT THAT IS REQUIRED. THIS BUDGET ONLY DELAYS THE INEVITABLE YOU WILL HAVE TO COME BACK AGAIN TO PLUG ANOTHER BUDGET DEFICIT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DO WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. FOR THESE REASONS I OPPOSE THIS BUDGET BECAUSE IT IS NOT BALLOTS IT IS NOT FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH FALLS SHORT OF WHAT TAXPAYERS EXPECTS OF US. MR LEVINE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ARE RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE BUDGET I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO OUR BUDGET CHAIR AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATIVE LEADERS FOR THE WORK THAT WE HAVE PUTIN TO GETTING TO THIS BUDGET ON JUNE. TWENTY SIX. IT WAS JUST A MONTH AGO ON MAY TWENTY SIX DURING COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE. THEN I RAISED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR STATE WHICH IS THE RISING SURGE OF CODED NINETEEN INFECTIONS IN OUR PRISONS. WHEN I SPOKE ON MAY TWENTY SIX THERE WERE NINE HUNDRED STATEWIDE INFECTIONS. ZERO AT SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON BUT TODAY WHEN I SPEAK TO YOU THERE ARE. FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE INFECTIONS. AND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT POSITIVES AT SAN QUENTIN. WHEN I ROSE ON MAY TWENTY SIX. I ASKED THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE FOR A PLAN HOW WILL OUR PRISONS PLAN FOR RESEARCH HOW WILL THEY PLAN FOR AN OUTBREAK HOW WILL THEY PLAN FOR THE NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK AND INFECTED WITH CODE NINETEEN. IT'S NOW JUNE TWENTY SIX AND THERE IS NO PLAN. THERE IS NO PLAN AT ALL THERE IS NO TESTING SYSTEM FOR ANY STAFF AT SAN QUENTIN RIGHT NOW A JUDGE HAD TO ROLL THAT THEY MUST TEST THE STAFF. BUT THERE IS NO ONGOING TEST FOR STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT BRINGING CODED IN. AND THERE IS NO PLAN FOR HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INMATES THE PRISONERS AT SAN QUENTIN ARE PROTECTED OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN PRISON FACILITIES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. NOW I HAVE BEEN ASSURED AGAIN I ASKED A MONTH AGO AT COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE FOR A PLAN AND A PLAN FOR HOSPITALIZATION I'VE BEEN ASSURED. BY THE GOVERNOR STAFF. THAT I WILL BE RECEIVING A DETAILED PLAN BUT MY COMMUNITY IS WAITING. MY HOSPITALS ARE CONCERNED THEY SEE THE RISING RATES OF INFECTION ACROSS THE STATE IN IN OUR COMMUNITY THERE IS COMMUNITY SPREAD. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THAT WE NEED TO PLAN FOR THOSE RISING NEEDS FOR HOSPITALIZATION AND I SEE USE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE. AN UNCONTROLLABLE OUTBREAK IN OUR PRISONS THAT WILL OVERWHELM LOCAL HOSPITAL CAPACITY IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. WE ARE WAITING FOR THE PLAN I ASKED FOR ON MAY TWENTY SIX IT'S JUNE TWENTY SIX TODAY. YESTERDAY DURING A CALL WITH OUR BUDGET CHAIR AND OUR SUB BUDGET CHAIR ON PUBLIC SAFETY. WE SPOKE WITH THE FEDERAL RECEIVER. WHERE HE ADMITTED HIS CULPABILITY. HIS MISTAKE HE USED THE WORD MISTAKE IN ORDERING THE TRANSFER OF PRISONERS FROM CHINO TO SAN QUENTIN. AND I AM CALLING ON JUDGE T&lt;c.cyan&gt; GAR TO&lt;/c&gt; RELIEVE THE FEDERAL RECEIVER CLARK KELSO OF HIS DUTIES AS A RECEIVER AND TO REPLACE THAT PERSON WITH SOMEONE WHO CAN MORE COMPETENTLY MAKE SURE THAT OUR PRISONERS ARE RECEIVING ADEQUATE CARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LEVINE. MR KILEY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AT TODAY WERE COMPLETING WHAT WILL SURELY GO DOWN AS THE LEAST TRANSPARENT BUDGET PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. CALIFORNIA HAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY LEGISLATORS AND FORTY MILLION PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM BY THE WAY IT'S THEIR- BUT UP UNTIL A FEW DAYS AGO THE CONTENTS OF THIS BUDGET WERE- KNOWN. TO ALL BUT A FEW PEOPLE. WHAT HAPPENS IN HERE. IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE OF A FORMALITY. AND I KNOW SOME WILL SAY THIS IS JUST BECAUSE OF COVERT NINETEEN. BUT IT'S AWFULLY CONVENIENT. THAT TE DISTORTIONS TO THE PROCESS AND MADE IN THE NAME OF COVERT. HAVE SERVED TO EXTEND TRENDS THAT ARE YEARS IN THE MAKING. DOING MORE AND MORE OF THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE PUBLIC'S. USING BUDGET TRAILER BILLS FOR LEGISLATION RATHER THAN IMPLMENTATION SHUTTING OUT AND ALL TOO OFTEN SHUTTING DOWN GROUPS THAT LACK POLITICAL POWER. BUT WHAT CONCERNS ME MOST IS THE PRESIDENT. BECAUSE IN RECENT YEARS EVERY STEP WE'VE TAKEN DOWN THE LADDER OF TRANSPARENCY HAS BROUGHT US WITHIN REACH OF THE NEXT WRONG HELLO WHEN I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NOW THAT WE FALLING OFF THE LADDER ALTOGETHER. DR ARAMBULA YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTY NINE AND ALL OF THE HARD WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO PREPARING AND PRESERVING THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FAMILIES RELY ON THE MOST AB EIGHTY NINE ACKNOWLEDGES THE REALITIES THAT ARE FAMILIES FACE AT THIS TIME. I'M GLAD THAT THIS BILL WE ARE PRESERVING SO MUCH OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE IN OUR RECENT YEARS THROUGH BENEFITS THAT I BELIEVE SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL WHETHER THEY ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR HEALTH CARE FOR HUMAN SERVICES SYSTEMS. PROGRAMS AND SERVICES SUPPORTED IN MAYBE EIGHTY NINE HERE TODAY OUR PROGRAM SUCH AS THE MEDICARE ALL ADULTS AND DENTAL OPTIONAL BENEFITS AND DIABETES. PREVENTION PROGRAMS THAT ARE SO CRITICAL FOR PREVENTATIVE HEALTH. FOR THE SEA BASS EMESIS PETE AND THE MEALS ON WHEELS THAT HELP OUR SENIORS BE HEALTHY AND SAFE IN THE COMFORT OF THEIR OWN HOMES. TO THE AGED AND DISABLED PROGRAM THAT HELPS THE POOREST OF THE POOR MAKE ENDS MEET. TO CAL WORKS THAT HELPS PUT FAMILIES BACK TO WORK TO THE EXTENDED FOSTER CARE TO HELP OUR YOUNG ADULTS WHO HAVE HAD SO MUCH DISRUPTION IN THEIR LIVES. THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. TO OUR DEVELOPMENT SERVICES PROGRAMS THAT HELP CREATE DIGNITY AND EQUITY FOR ARE DEPENDENT ADULTS. AND MANY OTHERS THAT WILL HELP OUR COUNTIES BEAR THE FINANCIAL COST OF THIS PANDEMIC. I KNOW THAT OUR WORK IS NOT OVER. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THIS BUDGET AGREEMENT INVEST IN OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES AND WILL HELP CARRY US THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND HELP US TO GET BACK ON YOUR FEET. I URGE AN AYE VOTE TODAY. THEY GET A CURRICULA LIKE ANY RECOGNIZE ON THE ADAM PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES AT THIS TIME MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- I RISE IN OPPOSITION DAVEY EIGHTY NINE. AND ONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN HERE THAT I. RELEASED STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSIDER. IN LAYING OFF THIS BILL AT THE VERY LEAST IS A PROVISION THAT GIVES THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION TOTAL DISCRETION. OVER MONIES. DESIGNED TO HELP YOUR COUNTIES RECOVER FROM COVE IN NINETEEN NOW THIS IS UP ALMOST UPWARDS OF A BILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL CARES MONEY. THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO GO TO YOUR COUNTIES. TO THE PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT WHO WHO ALL OF US EVERY COUNTY WAS ON TOUCH WAS EVERY COUNTY WAS TOUCHED BY COVERT NINETEEN IN SOME WAY EVERY BUSINESS. IN YOUR DISTRICT WAS TOUCHED IN SOME WAY BY COVERT NINETEEN UP UPWARDS OF A BILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S COMING TO HELP YOUR COUNTIES. IS SUBJECT ON THE WHIM OF THE GOVERNOR. TO BE WITHHELD. SALES TAX MONIES IT'S COMING BACK INTO HELP REIMBURSED YOUR COUNTIES- TO MAKE UP THAT BACK FILL OF SALES TAX MONIES LOST DURING COVERED NINETEEN IS SUBJECT TO THE WHIM OF THE GOVERNOR. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT MONEY WILL ACTUALLY GO. IN INSTEAD OF US BEING IN CONTROL THE LEGISLATURE WHO CONTROLS THE PURSE. INSTEAD OF US BEING A CONTROL INSANE THIS MONEY IS DESIGNED TO BE FOR EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA. A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AS THE GOVERNOR TALKS ABOUT. IS SUPPOSED TO GO TO ALL OF US BECAUSE WE'VE ALL BEEN IMPACTED. NOW SOME OF OU MIGHT SAY WELL I TRUST THE GOVERNOR. HE'LL MAKE GOOD DECISIONS HE WILL HELP YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT TO MY AREA. AND LET ME JUST GIVE YOU EXHIBIT DAY BECAUSE I'VE GONE THROUGH THIS ALREADY IN MY DISTRICT AND I WANT YOU TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THIS. THE YUBA SUTTER REGION. OPENED UP EARLY AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HEARD IN THE MEDIA. BUT WHAT YOU DIDN'T HEAR. AND WHAT NOBODY REALLY TALKED ABOUT AS A THAT WAS OPENED NOT BY PEOPLE JUST MOVING FORWARD AND SAYING WE'RE GONNA OPEN IT WAS OPENED BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. A MINORITY WOMAN DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINS EDUCATED DOCTOR. WHO MADE THE DECISION TO OPEN BASED ON JOHN HOPKINS SAFETY PROTOCOLS THE SAME ONES THAT THE GOVERNOR SAID THAT THEY WERE GOING TO FOLLOW. AND HOW WAS. MY COUNTY TREATED MY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER TREATED BY THIS GOVERNOR. SHE WAS DENIGRATED AS SAYING SHE'S RECKLESS AND SHE IS DANGEROUS. AND WHEN OUR BUSINESSES OPEN UNDER THAT SAFETY PROTOCOL THAT INCLUDED MASKS THAT INCLUDED ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WILL BE DISTANCED THAT INCLUDED ALL THESE SOCIAL AT ALL THE SAFETY PROTOCOLS. THE GOVERNOR SENT OUT AGENTS ABC AGENTS AND OTHERS TO PENALIZE THESE BUSINESSES. MANY OF THEM MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES AND RESTAURANTS. THE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH ALL THE HELL THAT CAME WITH COVERT NINETEEN OF HAVING TO BE SHUT DOWN. AND BEING ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY ONLY HAVE THE GOVERNMENT COME IN AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO SHUT YOU DOWN WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO FIND YOU. WE'RE GONNA SUBJECTED TO PROBATION THAT'S HOW THIS GOVERNOR EXERCISED. HIS AUTHORITY AGAINST MY COUNTIES. ONE WOMAN BUSINESS OWNER WAILING BASICALLY ON THE VERGE OF SUICIDE. WARNING THAT SHE WAS GONNA HAVE AN A. B. C. AGENT CLOSER BUSINESS DOWN AND SHE WAS GOING TO BE OUT OF BUSINESS FOREVER. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THIS GOVERNOR GOT TOTAL DISCRETION ABOUT. AND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE END CAUSE ANY THREATEN MY COUNTY TO TAKE AWAY EMERGENCY FUNDS FEDERAL EMERGENCY FUNDS. FROM MARK COUNTIES. BECAUSE IN HIS SOLE DISCRETION WE WEREN'T ACTING SAFELY EVEN THOUGH WE WERE OPERATING ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL. SAFETY COMPLIANCE DOCTRINES. AND YOU MIGHT SAY WELL THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN IN MY COUNTY. THE MAN LAST WEEK I HEARD I HEARD A LOT OF A SCENE INJUSTICE ANYWHERE. IS A THREAT TO JUSTICE EVERYWHERE. AND BY THE WAY WE'RE THE ONES WHO ARE IN CONTROL OF THE PURSE WHY ARE WE ALLOWING HIM TO DECIDE. WHETHER OR NOT WE GET RELIEF THAT WERE ALREADY ENTITLED TO. THAT ARE COUNTIES IN OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR PEOPLE ARE ALREADY ENTITLED TO. PLEASE DON'T DO THIS. THIRTY SECONDS. THERE IS ALREADY MENTIONED AGAIN WORD THIS LANGUAGE COME FROM IT WASN'T DEBATED HERE. IT WASN'T DEBATED IN THE SUB COMMITTEES ABOUT HAVING THIS AS A REQUIREMENT. IT WAS IN SECRET DEALINGS THAT ARE NOW ONLY COMING TO LIGHT AND YOU GOT A VOTE ON YOU GOT TO VOTE YES OR NO. LET'S HOLD THE LINE AND SAY NO GOVERNOR. NO WE'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU A LOT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO ACT JUSTLY. TOWARDS OUR COMMUNITIES. IF YOU'RE AN ORANGE COUNTY YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO YOU. PLEASE GOD DON'T THINK IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. PLEASE VOTE NO OR LAY OFF OF THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THERE WAS GALLAGHER MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU. I AM. WAS PREPARED FOR MUST WORK MUCH WORSE BUDGET THEN WHAT IS PRINT BEING PRESENTED TODAY. I WAS PREPARING. MY CONSTITUENTS MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN PARTICULAR. FOR A MUCH WORSE BUDGET. YEAH REMINDING THEM THAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE WORST RECESSION SINCE PERHAPS THE GREAT DEPRESSION. AND SO WHEN I WAS CHECKING IN WITH MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THIS PAST WEEK THEIR RESPONSE IS ALMOST UNIFORM IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE. AND SO. I APPRECIATE OUR BUDGET CHAIR IN APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR AND THE SENATE FOR REACHING THIS DEAL THAT. STAYS OFF MANY OF THE PAINFUL THE MOST PAINFUL CUTS. THAT THE- WE COULD HAVE BEEN FACING A GIVEN THAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH PERHAPS THE WORST RECESSION SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. SO I WANTED TO FIRST- GOT HIGHLIGHT MY APPRECIATION FOR THAT BUT IT GOING FORWARD. AND I THINK THERE ISSUES NOT ONLY IN THIS BUDGET BELL BUT ALSO IN THE K. THROUGH TWELVE BUDGET TRAILER THAT I'LL BE ADDRESSING LATER. BUT THERE IS THE ONGOING ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER ALL OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE RECIEVING THE BASIC FUNDING THAT THEY NEED TO BE PREPARED TO CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THIS COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. I UNDERSTAND WHY THE GOVERNOR FOUGHT ROLE HARD TO DEVOTE THE OVERWHELMING. BALK OF THE FEDERAL CARES ACT DOLLARS TO THE HIGH POVERTY DISTRICTS THAT ARE DEMONSTRATING THE BIGGEST LEARNING LOSSES IN THIS AGE OF COVERT NINETEEN AND IN THIS AGE OF DISTANCE LEARNING. BUT I ASKED THE LA- FOR SOME BREAKDOWNS IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW WHAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE RECEIVING ON A PER PUPIL BASIS. IN THE NAME OF EQUITY. AND SO YOU KNOW AS AN EXAMPLE I REPRESENT. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED REPORTS OF A PORTION OF LOS ANGELES UNIFIED AS WELL AS THE HERMOSA BEACH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM ONE FROM THE EAST END OF MY DISTRICT TO THE WEST AND ON THE COAST. THE OTHER END OF MY DISTRICT. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED ON A PER PEOPLE BASIS IS GOING TO BE RECEIVING UNDER THIS FINAL BUDGET DEAL. FIFTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS PER STUDENT. HER MOST TO BEACH SCHOOL DISTRICT IS GO GOING TO BE RECEIVING. NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE DOLLARS AND PER PEOPLE SPENDING. MORE THAN A SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR GAP FOR EACH KID WHETHER YOU'RE IN LA UNIFIED OR WHETHER YOU IN HERMOSA BEACH UNIFIED. NOW AGAIN YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT- HERMOSA. IS. MORE AFFLUENT THAN MOST OF THE LAUSD NEIGHBORHOODS. BUT SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR GAP A SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR DEFICIT AT SOME POINT I CANNOT SUPPORT A BUDGET THAT DOESN'T GIVE THE BASIC FUNDING TO ALL OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE IN THIS COVER NINETEEN REALITY. THE ONLY REASSURED THIS MORNING FROM THE LA THAT. UNDER THIS DEAL. THAT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCLUDING HERMOSA BEACH UNIFIED WILL BE GETTING. MORE THAN THEY ARE RECEIVING IN THIS CURRENT SCHOOL THE IN THIS CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MUCH IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE FOR. HERMOSA AND- ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE PER STUDENT FOR LA UNIFIED. AGAIN YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE GREATEST. YOU KNOW RESOURCES TO GO TO VEGAS TO THE STUDENTS WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS. BUT LET'S NOT KEEP IN MIND THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE BASIC FUNDING THE BASIC GRANT ISSUE OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE BASIC ADEQUACY OF FUNDING FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO THAT ALL OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. CAN CONTINUE TO EDUCATE OUR KIDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI MISTER MCCARTY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER OUT I'LL TALK LATER ON THE EDUCATION TRAILER BILL THE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM. SOUTH LA MENTION BUT THE BIG PICTURE ON THIS BUDGET IS- WE HAD TO BRIDGE TWO VERSIONS THE GOVERNOR'S NAVY REVISE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER FOR US THREE OPENING OUR STATE TURNING BACK ON THE LIGHTS WHICH ARE ECONOMY. PROPERLY FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS CHILD CARE CENTERS BECAUSE OF THOSE TWO THINGS AREN'T WORKING PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO WORK AND I LIKE TO KNOW THAT ARE SPEAKER BUDGET SHARE THE PRO TâM AND BUDGET CHAIR DID A GREAT JOB AGO SHADING AND THIS IS. A GOOD DEAL OF CALIPH SCHOOLS AND FIRST. HEATHER BUDGETS NOTED THIS IS AGAIN TO GET A PLAQUE AWAY. FROM OUR FOR BOND. NOR IS GOING TO US IN THE PAST AND BACK FROM THE- AUSTERITY GROUP THAT WANTS TO JUDGES FROM THE TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. BUT OUR JOB IS TO FOCUS ON OUR COMMUNITIES BACK HOME OUR SCHOOLS ARE COLLEGES OR UNIVERSITIES. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE HOW SYSTEM. MR BUT- GLOW. CRY AND PAN. AND THE CHOICES WE HAVE TO MAKEHERE.ARE NOT PERFECT EVERY BUDGET HAS BLOCKS EVERY BUDGET IS YOU KNOW PORTS AND PICK. ONE HAS QUITE A FEW BUT ARE TWO. IS WHAT IS VERY VERY STE I GREW. AND SO THIS PLACE. PLAN FOR ALL OF. IT'S GOOD DIFFICULT NOW YEAR AS AS WE AS WELL. BUT THIS ALLOWS US TO READ NON SIR. CAL. BACK TO. MOST POORLY OPEN PART. SYSTEM EDUCATE THROUGH THIS WITH LAST BY THE- THANK YOU MISTER MAKER. THANK YOU MEMBER. MR. MS REYES IS MAKING HER WAY TO THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER MS RACE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS ARE RISING URGENT AYE VOTE ON EIGHTY EIGHTY NINE. WE ALL KNOW THAT WE'RE LIVING IN AN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES AND IN THESE TIMES IT REQUIRES ACTION. THAT IS WHAT THIS BUDGET REPRESENTS. A CALL TO ACTION TO RESPOND TO ONE OF THE MOST DEVASTATING ADVANCE TO FACE AREN'T STATE AND OUR NATION. IT'S FUN OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE FACED THIS BUDGET PROTECTS. VITAL SERVICES FROM DEVASTATING CUTS AND MAKES INVESTMENTS IN OUR FUTURE. SPECIFICALLY TO ASSIST OUR WORKING FAMILIES. AS A STATE WITNESS IN BUDGETS FROM DECADES AGO. FAILING TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE HAS LONG TERM COSTS THAT IN MANY CASES WE ARE STILL ADDRESSING TO THIS DAY. THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO PASS THIS BUDGET THAT MAKES RESPONSIBLE CHOICES WITHOUT PLACING THE BURDEN OF THOSE CHOICES ON THOSE THAT CAN LEAST AFFORD IT. AS LEGISLATORS. WE HAVE A DUTY TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES THIS BUDGET PROTECTS CORE EDUCATION PROGRAMS PROTECTS CHILD CARE FUNDING RATES AND PROTECTS KEY HEALTH AND SENIOR PROGRAMS AND IT DOES SO ONE AWAY THE DOES NOT ASSUME FEDERAL FUNDING. WE NEED TO REBUILD OUR ECONOMY PROTECT JOBS AND GIVE OUR COMMUNITIES HOPE. AND LET'S NOT FORGET AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO SHARED. THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY IN THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUED THE HARD DISCUSSIONS AFTER OUR VOTE LAST WEEK TO MAKE SURE THAT TODAY'S. BUDGET REPRESENTED A BETTER PROPOSAL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ONE LAST POINT IS SOMETHING THAT IS A VERY KEY IN THIS IS THAT IT DID SHORES THAT NO CHILDREN ARE CUT FROM EXISTING CARE PROGRAMS IT PROTECTS CHILD CARE FUNDING RATES AND INCREASES CHILD CARE ACCES FOR CENTRAL WORKERS. WE TALK AND WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND HERE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON THE BUDGET THAT IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE VERY PEOPLE WE HAVE SAID WE WERE GOING TO PROTECT. THIS IS THE BUDGET THE REPRESENTS A COMPROMISE THESE ARE DIFFICULT TIMES. NOBODY WANTS TO VOTE ON THIS BILL IT'S CLEAR FROM SOME OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. BUT WE HAVE TO VOTE ON A BILL THAT IS GOING TO PROTECT THE VERYPEOPLE WE SAID. WHEN WE RAN FOR OFFICE THE VERY PEOPLE WE SAID WE WERE GOING TO PROTECT. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS I URGE AN AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU MISS REST. THANK YOU MEMBERS MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS COLLEAGUES I RISE TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BUDGET AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR THE SENATE AND OUR HOUSE FIRST I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PUBLICLY THANK THE SENATE AND THE SENATE PRO TEM IN PARTICULAR.

THERE NEEDS HAVE INCREASED DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THEM WE OF COURSE MUST ALSO THINK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS AGREEMENT ON IMPORTANT ISSUES LIKE THIS EXPANSION OF CALLIE ITC TO INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER FILERS WITH CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF SIX PREVENTING LAYOFFS IN SCHOOLS AND WORKING TOWARD FALL. WAS AWESOME THANK. THE COLLABORATION BY THE- THIS KEY BECAUSE EDUCATION IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR ATTEMPTS TO KEEP CALIFORNIA GROWING. THIS BUDGET RECOGNIZES THAT. I WANT TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE STATE EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THEY WERE KEY IN BUDGET DISCUSSIONS. THEY MADE SACRIFICES AT THE BARGAINING TABLE EVEN AS THEY ARE DOING THE HARD WORK TO ASSIST RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES. DEAL WITH THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS WE ARE GOING THROUGH. AS I SAID LAST TIME WE MET WE MET THERE IS MORE TO BE DONE. WE MUST URGE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DEVELOP MEANINGFUL AID FOR STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT NEEDED PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS TO BOOST THE ECONOMY AND TO HELP RESTORE FUNDING TO ARE PRIZED UNIVERSITIES. TO OUR HOUSING PROGRAMS AND TO OTHER TASKS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. LASTLY BUT ABOVE ALL I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE.

THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE MISTER FONG RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. I THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. MEMBERS I RISE REGRETFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO AB SEVEN SEVEN SB NINETY EIGHT. THIS BILL INCLUDES TROUBLING PROVISIONS THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS CHARTER SCHOOLS AND LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THIS BILL AUTHORIZES BILLIONS IN ONGOING DEFERRALS WITH UNCERTAIN ONE TIME RELIEF. BASED ON THE DEFERRAL SCHEDULE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES MAY NOT RECEIVE. ANY STATE A POOR UNFORTUNATE FUNDING FOR FIVE MONTHS FROM FEBRUARY THROUGH JUNE. THIS BILL ALSO EXCLUDES NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS AND STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF AND BLIND. FOR MORE THAN FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION IN STATE AND FEDERAL CORONAVIRUS REALLY FUNDING.

THIS BILL ALL AFFECTS HER SCHOOL IN THE WAY THEY HAVE THE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS AS AND ROLL GROWTH. THEY'LL SEE FUNDING LIMITED BECAUSE THEY CAPS THERE WERE CAN IN THIS BILL EITHER TWENTY NINTH TWENTY LEVEL WHICH MAY THAT SUCCESS. CHARTER SCHOOLS WILL BE NEGATIVELY. PARENTS AND- IN MY JUST.

TWELVE FOR AND THE IS A GOOD REASON TO SUPPORT IT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I THANK THE CHAIR AND MANY OTHERS IN THIS ROOM IN THIS BILL.

BECAUSE OF THE LANGUAGE AND SB NINETY EIGHT IS SOMEWHAT RESTRICTIVE. AND DEFINITELY NOT CLEAR FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. SO VERY SIMPLY I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REVISIT THIS- IN A SUBSEQUENT TRAILER BILL TO CLARIFY. THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO ONLINE IN A VERY RAPID FASHION OR CREATE SOME HYBRID MODEL AND A VERY RAPID FASHION. SHOULD THEY NEED TO DO THAT FOR STUDENT HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS BUT- THE FIRST PRIORITY SHOULD BE TO GET. OUR CHILDREN. BACK IN SCHOOL AT A SCHOOL SITE BUT CERTAINLY WITH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY IN MIND AND FOLLOWING ALL. STATE AND LOCAL GUIDANCE SO WITH THAT I TURNED IT BACK TO YOU MATTERS. THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL. THIS VALUE ARE. IN REAR CHAMBER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER TODAY I WRI IN OPPOSITION OF SB NINETY AB SEVENTY SEVEN THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THAT CAP KATE TWELVE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE AT TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY LEVELS WILL UNFAIRLY PUNISHED SCHOOLS THAT OPERATE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS AND ATTRACTED NEWS STERN STUDENTS DURING CODE NINETEEN. MANY OF WHICH WILL LIKELY BE CHARTER SCHOOLS SO PARENTS HAVE RESEARCHED AND FOUND THE BEST SCHOOL OPTION FOR THEIR CHILD DURING THIS PANDEMIC THE SCHOOL OF THEIR CHOICE WILL NOT RECEIVE THE EIGHTY EIGHT TO COVER THE COST OF EDUCATING THEIR CHILD. IN A TIME WHEN FAMILIES ARE SCRAMBLING TO ME THAT THEIR CHILD RECEIVES A QUALITY EDUCATION AB SEVENTY SEVEN SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE THIS GOAL THIS IS UNFAIR ABOUT STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS AND I STRONGLY URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER WITH LIMóN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR THAT. THANK YOU I THINK YOU SPEAKER AND MEMBER. WE ALL KNOW THE THIS IS A- TO BY HAND FOR MAY OF US IT'S THE FOR BUDGET WE VOTE ON DURING A RECESSION. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE ALL OF THE WORK OF ALL OF THOSE INVOLVED INCLUDING OUR BUDGET CHAIR AND SAID CHAIR. ON THESE ISSUES. I AM SUPPORTING TODAY'S BUDGET AND DO SO KNOWING THAT THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES AND CHALLENGES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN SB NINETY EIGHT. OUR CALLED MY COLLEAGUES EVERY ISSUES RELATED TO THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION. FOR NOT JUST CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS A LIKE. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT AS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER THESE CHALLENGES IMPACT THE LOCALS AND A VERY REAL WAY. THEY IMPLY ENROLLMENT. EDDIE NOW. AND MUCH MORE. ADDITIONALLY ALL SCHOOLS HAVE TAKEN ON RESPONSIBILITIES BEYOND WHAT THEY WERE DOING TAKE AND HAVE COMPLETELY CHANGED THE WAY THAT THEY PROVIDE EDUCATION WE KNOW THAT IN THESE TIMES THEY NEED MORE FUNDING NOT LESS WE'VE HEARD FROM TEACHERS FROM SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS FROM SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND MANY MORE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE UPON THEM. IN THIS VERY MOMENT. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON WAYS TO CORRECT SOME OF THESE ISSUES WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS NOT A PERFECT BUDGET. BUT IT ALSO MUST BE SAID. BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE ME REVISED AND LOOK WHAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISE. THIS IS A BETTER OPTIONS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WE PROPOSED IN THE ME REVISED LARGER CUTS TO CLASSROOMS WE PROPOSED A DIFFERENT TYPE OF FUNDING FORMULA AND WHILE THERE IS NO EASY DECISIONS WE HAVE GOT TO MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY THAT HELPS SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ADDITIONALLY I WANT TO RECOGNIZE. THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT WE'VE DONE FOR CHILD CARE. MANY IN THIS AND I KNOW THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS CHAMPION CHILD CARE AND THIS IS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND YOU SEE IN THIS BUDGET OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT. CHILD CARE EVEN IN A TIME OF CRISIS. ONE NOT PERFECT THIS BUDGET PRIORITIZES FUNDING FOR EDUCATION FOR CHILD CARE AND MANY PROGRAMS ARE CONSTITUENTS RELY ON I TO WANT MORE FROM FUNDING AND I WANT TO SAVE MORE PROGRAMS BUT I UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION THAT WE ARE FACING DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES WE MUST PASS A BUDGET THAT IS RESPONSIBLE AND IT PROTECTS ALL CALIFORNIA FAMILIES EVEN IF IT'S DIFFICULT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS THEM ON THIS EGGMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WITH THE CAVEA OF COURSE- WELL IT. MAINTAINS FUNDING FOR MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS I HAVE AT LEAST ONE RAPIDLY GROWING SCHOOL DISTRICT IN MY DISTRICT IN MOUNTAIN HOUSE. THAT WILL BE HARMED BY THIS SO I KNOW THAT THEY'RE STILL ONGOING CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO VOTE ON THIS TODAY AND FULL SUPPORT BECAUSE FOR THE MOST PART. IT PRESERVES EDUCATION ACROSS STATE A CALIFORNIA BUT FOR THOSE DISTRICTS WHO ARE PERFORMING VERY WELL AND HAVERAPID GROWTH I THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIND SOME FIXES FOR THOSE AS WELL AND I LOOK FOR THOSE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS SEGMENT MR GIVING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO THANK THE GOVERNOR. AND THE BUDGET CHAIR FOR INCLUDING THE FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM DURING CORPORATE NINETEEN THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIS IS AN EFFORT THAT I CHAMPION THROUGH LEGISLATION AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION WAS A TONY THURMOND. FOR FOOD IN SECURITIES A LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT AND IN ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE ARE JUST SOME OF THE BARRIERS TO. STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE CURRENTLY FACE ARE FACING EXORBITANT- BY EXACERBATING USUALLY BY THE COLD AT NIGHT CRY. GIMME SCHOOLS OFFER UNIQUE MODELS TO ADDRESS THEIR HURDLES THROUGH WRAPAROUND SERVICES INCREASING- PARENT PARTICIPATION AND ENGAGEMENT AND RESTORATIVE PRACTICES. THIS IS ABOUT QUALITY AND BEST SERVING THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. THROUGH BEST PRACTICES SPECULATE I ALSO AYE VOTE ON A. NINETY EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER GET SET PATTERSON YOU ARE. AS. I MANAGED MEMBERS I TO RISE WITH GREAT CA IN AND- TO THIS BILL FOR A COUPLE REASONS UP FIRST OF ALL ALTHOUGH IT IS AND TO. BETTER FUND SCHOOLS GENERAL. I JUST DON'T THINK IT GOES FAR ENOUGH AND I THINK AS OTHER MEMBERS HAVE SUGGESTED THIS LEAVE SOME- SCHOOL DISTRICT REALLY OUT IN THE COLD. I ALSO WANT TO RAISE AN OBJECTION OVER UTILIZING. A BUDGET TRAILER BILL TO ESSENTIALLY CARVE OUT CHARTER SCHOOLS FROM FAIR TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW. IT THIS SHOULD HAVE ON THROUGH THE NORMAL AN ORDINARY LEGISLATIVE PROCESS I RAISE IT BECAUSE I HAVE RECEIVED. DOZENS OF PLEASE FROM PRINCIPLES PERRANCE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS IN MY AREA. THERE IS NO NEED TO PENALIZE CHARTER SCHOOLS HERE. AND THIS IS A VERY RECKLESS WAY OF DOING IT. I POINT TO UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL IT IS ON THE CAMPUS OF FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY IT IS ONE OF THE TOP CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES WINNING ACCOLADES OVER AND OVER AGAIN. FOR WHAT THEY ARE ABLE TO DO WITH THE STUDENTS THAT ATTEND. AND THIS TRAILER BILL ESSENTIALLY SAYS THEY DON'T COUNT. CARVE OUT. PENALIZED THIS IS NOT FAIR LEGISLATION I ASK THAT YOU EITHER LAY OFF OR OPPOSE- FOR THE REASONS THAT I'VE JUST SUGGESTED THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION- TO THIS BILL CERTAINLY. WE HAVE FOUGHT FOR AND I THINK IT IS LAUDABLE THAT WE'VE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY GOING INTO EDUCATION K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION IN THIS BUDGET. CERTAINLY BETTER THAN THE MAY REVISE. THAT WE ALL SAW THAT WE WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT ON THIS FLOOR WE HAD THE COMMITTEE ON THE WHOLE. THAT IS A BENEFIT BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL THING THAT IS WRONG WITH THIS TRAILER BILL IS THAT IT TAKES AWAY FROM THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE MONEY SHOULD FOLLOW THE STUDENT. AND THE REASON WHY WE DO THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE KIDS. IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE STUDENTS AND ENSURING THAT THEY ARE GETTING. WHAT THEY NEED. TO SUCCEED. AND INSTEAD IT IT FREEZES THE MONEY BASED ON EIGHTY A OF LAST YEAR. SO REGARDLESS OF WHERE THOSE WHERE THAT KID GOES. THE-MONEY'S FROZEN IT DOES NOT FOLLOW HIM OR HER. AND WHAT IS THAT WHAT MESSAGE DOES THAT SEND. TO THE STUDENTS AND THE PARENTS OF THE STATE. IT SAYS THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR US TO SHORE UP AND PROTECT THE INSTITUTION. THE K. THROUGH TWELVE INSTITUTION IN THE STATE THEN IT IS TO LOOK OUT FOR THE KIDS AND WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THOSE KIDS. AND THAT HAS REALLY BEEN THE CONTINUING PROBLEM WITH EDUCATION IN THE STATE IS IN IT. BECAUSE THAT'S AN INSTITUTION THAT AS WE ALL KNOWN AS WE SAID SEVERAL TIMES ON THIS FLOOR. IS FAILING BLACK AND BROWN STUDENTS IN THE STATE. THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS STILL SO WIDE AND WE ARE NOT MAKING PROGRESS. AND WE'RE GOING TO SHORE UP THAT INSTITUTION TODAY LAST LAST WEEK. WE MOVED QUICKLY. TO ADDRESS PROP TWO OH NINE HAD TO DO IT URGENT HAD TO DO THIS TO ADDRESS THIS VITAL ISSUE BUT TODAY ON THIS FLOOR NOT URGENT TO ADDRESS THAT K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION PROBLEM THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP LET'S JUST KEEP SHORING UP. THIS INSTITUTION BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT. THEN WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THOSE KIDS. MANY OF THOSE KIDS ARE TRYING TO GET OUT OF SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT GETTING THE JOB DONE. MANY OF THOSE. pIN FRONT OF TEACHERS THAT WILL ADDRESS. THOSE CONCERNS. BUT THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL TODAY SAYS NOW. WE DON'T CARE IF YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR KIDS SOMEWHERE ELSE WE DON'T CARE IF YOU WANT TO GET A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUR KID THE MONEY'S NOT GOING TO FALL ON. IT'S GOING TO STAY IN THE INSTITUTION. I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO SERIOUSLY CHECK OURSELVES WITH THIS WHY WOULD YOU PUT THAT IN THERE WHY WOULD YOU CHANGE THE ROLE. THIS SAYS THE MONEY SHOULD FALL THE STUDNTS THERE IS NO OTHER REASON FOLKS. YOU VOTE FOR THIS YOU'RE VOTING FOR AN INSTITUTION THAT IS FAILING OUR KIDS. WE CAN DO BETTER. WE CAN AND WE SHOULD DO BETTER. I URGE YOU TO REJECT THIS BILL OR AT LEAST STAY OFF OF IT. AND LET'S GET SOMETHING BETTER FOR OUR STUDENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER MISTER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU. I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINETY EIGHT. AND I DON'T TAKE THAT LIGHTLY. BUT I FEEL THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO. DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR OUR KIDS. AND THAT WAS RIGHT FOR OUR KIDS SHOULD NOT BE A PARTY ISSUE. I HAVE SEVERAL PROBLEMS. WITH THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL. FIRST OF ALL I WANNA AGAIN ACKNOWLEDGE. THE WORK OF THE BUDGET CHAIR AND THOSE THAT MADE SURE THAT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD RECEIVE MORE MONIES THAN THEIR RECEIVING THIS YEAR AND CERTAINLY MORE THAN WHAT THEY WOULD BEEN RECEIVING ARE THE NAY REVISE I DO APPRECIATE THAT. BUT THIS IS. A MULTI YEAR EFFORT THERE WERE ENGAGING IN TO PROVIDE THE BEST EDUCATION FOR OUR KIDS AND WE ARE TAKING AWAY A- SEE THE NECESSARY FLEXIBILITY. THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND FAMILIES NEED TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS COVER NINETY NINETEEN REALITY. YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL. THERE ARE. THESE VAGUE AND UNCLEAR MANDATES ON DISTANCE LEARNING THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL THAT SHOULD. HAVE BEEN VETTED FULLY VETTED THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PART OF THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL. YOU KNOW AND THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME AND FOR MANY OF US. YOU KNOW. MY WIFE AND I AS PARENTS. WHERE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH THE DECISION ABOUT WHETHER WE WERE GOING TO FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH OUR DAUGHTER GOING BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE FALL YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH UNKNOWN ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THIS VIRUS YOU KNOW WITH ANY VACCINE OR TREATMENT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE ANYTHING BY THE FALL AND YET THIS. BUDGET TRAILER HAS LANGUAGE THAT IS IT- TELLING SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT THEY NEED TO DO YOU KNOW EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO GET THE KIDS BACK IN THE SCHOOLS YOU KNOW UNLESS THEIR ORDERS FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER OR UNLESS THE CHILD IS MEDICALLY VULNERABLE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME. YOU KNOW ONGOING EFFORTS THE THAT THE CHAIR OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. INDICATED THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE FURTHER WORK ON THIS THAT THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IN EDUCATION FUNDING INDICATED THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE. YOU KNOW OUT OF A LETTER. TO TRY TO- CLARIFY SOME OF THESE UNCLEAR MANDATES BUT AGAIN I MEAN WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A FULL OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN THESE REAL ISSUES ABOUT DISTANCE LEARNING RATHER THAN HAVING THIS RAM THROUGH US. THROUGH THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL SO I OBJECT TO THIS BEING IN THE BUDGET TRAILER. SECOND OF ALL. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO GIVE FAMILIES THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEAL WITH COVERT NINETEEN AND I HAVE TO SAY. I AGREE WITH MANY OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES THAT ARE GETTING UP TO TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS UNFAIRLY CAPPING. THE ENROLLMENT OF SCHOOLS THAT FAMILIES ARE TURNING TO DEAL WITH THIS CUP IN NINETEEN REALITY. YOU KNOW I I'VE I'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL MY CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY HAVE ELDERLY IN THE HOUSEHOLD THEY HAVE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY THAT ARE. IMMUNE COMPROMISED. AND NO WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS THIS COVER NINETEEN REALITY AND WE NEED THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW. DO WHAT'S BEST FOR KIDS. AND IN OUR IN OUR FAMILIES AND TO CAP THE ENROLLMENT OF SOME OF THESE- NON CLASSROOM CHARTERS THAT THAT FAMILIES ARE TURNING TO YOU KNOW AS THEIR BEST OPTION AFTER SURVEYING ALL THE OPTIONS YOU KNOW MAKING HARD DECISIONS. WE CAN'T TAKE AWAY THAT FLEXIBILITY FROM THE FAMILIES ARE TRYING TO THE RIGHT THINGS FOR THEIR KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND SO. AGAIN I DON'T TAKE THIS LIGHTLY BUT- WE NEED TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR OUR KIDS TO DEAL WITH THIS COVER NINETEEN REALITY AND FOR THAT REASON I'LL BE VOTING NO ON SB NINETY EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER MESSAGE TO KILEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. I RISE IN OPPOSITION THIS BILL CONTAINS PROFOUND CHANGES TO EDUCATION FINANCE THAT WERE DROPPED AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR OUT OF THE BLUE- WITHOUT ANY PUBLIC PARTICIPATION- OR ANY PROCESS AS ONE OF THE ADVOCATES FOR THE TYPES OF SCHOOLS THAT'LL BE MOST NEGATIVELY IMPACTED PUT IT IN MY THIRTY YEARS OF CLOSE INVOLVEMENT IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE BUDGET PROCESS. I'VE NEVER WITNESSED SUCH AN EGREGIOUS ABUSE. SO WHY IS IT THAT SCHOOLS GROW WHAT COULD BE BECAUSE THE COMMUNITES ARE GROWING. AND IT'S ALSO BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB. AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE. OF THOSE SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT ASSIGNED TO STUDENTS BY THE DEFAULT OF THE ZIP CODE. BUT HAVE TO ATTRACT THEM TO OFTEN THROUGH A DESIRABLE PRODUCT AND THAT THE SAP OF OUR PUBLIC AT. SYSTEM THAT WE CALL CHARTER SCHOOLS. THIS HAPPENS TO BE THE SECTOR THAT HAS PIONEERED THE MODELS OF DISTANCE LEARNING. THAT HAVE PROVEN TO BE OF SUCH ABOUT. SO WHAT'S THE PRACTICAL IMPACT OF THIS WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF JOHN ADAMS WHICH IS A- FEW SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT. THEY OPERATE CAMPUSES IN EL DORADO HILLS LINCOLN IN ROSEVILLE THAT SERVE TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE STUDENTS THIS LAST YEAR. AS OF TODAY JOHN ADAMS IS ALREADY ENROLLED EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE NEW STUDENTS ACROSS THREE CAMPUSES FOR THE COMING SCHOOL YEAR. THEY'VE HIRED THIRTY NINE NEW CREDENTIALED TEACHERS AND TWELVE ADDITIONAL STAFF TO SUPPORT THIS GROWTH IN ENROLLMENT IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW JOHN ADAMS WILL ROUTE LOSE AROUND EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING AND WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE ENROLLMENT OF THESE NEW STUDENTS. WILL ALSO BE UNABLE TO RETAIN THE FIFTY ONE NEWLY HIRED TEACHERS AND STAFF WHO THEN BE LEFT WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT AT A TIME WHEN MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY AFLOAT FINANCIALLY. THE SAME IS TRUE OF MANY DISTRICTS THE ROSE BOWL JOINT UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT- WHICH IS ALSO IN MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. IS PROJECTED TO HAVE THREE HUNDRED NEW STUDENTS THIS COMING YEAR HAS ALREADY HIRED STAFF. AND THIS BILL LEAVE THEM WITHOUT THE RESOURCES. THAT THEY NEED SO HOW DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE. WHY WHY DO THESE PROVISIONS EXIST. WELL MAYBE ONE CLUE COMES IN THE COMMUNITY THAT IS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED- WITH THIS BILL AND EXCLUDED FROM. CORONA VIRUS I RELIEF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF IT AND THAT'S THE NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS WHICH IS SEVERAL PEOPLE OF SAID ARE- SCHOOLS THAT MANY STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. HAVE BEEN TURNING TO. AGAIN AND AGAIN TIME AFTER TIME. WE'VE HAD BILLS THAT TARGET THIS COMMUNITY. THIS LEGISLATION ONLY MAKES SENSE IN LIGHT OF THAT INVIDIOUS PATTERN OF DISCRIMINATION. I MEAN THE PARENTS AND FAMILIES AND SCHOOL LEADERS AND TEACHERS AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO ARE PART OF THIS COMMUNITY THEY LOOK UPON OUR STATE GOVERNMENT WITH NOTHING BUT FEAR. THIS WONDER WHAT NEXT. WHAT HARM IS GONNA BE DONE TO ME IN MY SCHOOL AND MY WAY OF LIFE. FROM THE RAREFIED PROCEEDINGS. OF THIS CHAMBER. THAT'S A DYNAMIC THAT SHOULD NEVER EXISTING MODERN LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. YEAH THIS BILL INTENSIFIES IT LIKE NEVER BEFORE I'M ASKING YOU TO PLEASE VOTE NO. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY A MISTER RICARDO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP. BUT THE BIG PICTURE IS LOOK WHEN WE ALL RAN FOR OFFICE THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT I'M SURE IS EDUCATION. OUR KIDS ARE YOU WE TALKED ABOUT THE FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL IN THE BUDGET WE SAID THE NUMBER ONE THING WE WANT TO ADDRESS IS OUR SCHOOLS FROM EARLY EDUCATION THROUGH COLLEGE IN K. TWELVE IN THE MIDDLE. AND THIS BILL DOES THAT TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY SURE THE DEFERRALS ARE THE OPTIMAL WAY TO GO BUT IF YOU ASK THE SCHOOL THIS WOULD RATHER TAKE A DEFERRAL DEFERRING. YOUR CASH FOR A FEW MONTHS OR AN EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR HIT TO SCHOOL FUNDING. THEY WOULD TAKE THE PEARLS THERE IS NO- TOOTH FAIRY HERE HANDING OUT MONEY AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO DEFERRAL SO LET'S HAVE A REALITY CHECK THEIR- DODD AS NOTED BUT- BY. MY COLLEAGUE SANTA BY. FROM THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. THIS BUDGET MADE TO RE PRIORITIZE FUNDING FOR OUR SCHOOLS BUT ALSO EARLY EDUCATION BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TURN BACK ON THE ECONOMY. YOU CAN'T GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. UNLESS YOU FULLY FIND. EARLY EDUCATION AND WE KNOW CHILD CARE CENTERS. ARE REALLY I'M DYING AT THE VINE AS FAR AS INADEQUATE FUNDING. AND PERMISSION TO READ REAL QUICK MADAM SPEAKER. WITHOUT OBJECTION JUST A HEADLINE TODAY JUST READ A FEW MOMENTS AGO. SAYS TODAY'S HEADLINES FROM POLITICO A LACK OF CHILD CARE IS KEEPING WOMEN ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT ROLLS WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION THE WORK FORCE WAS QUITE THE CLOSELY TIED TO ACCESS TO CHILDCARE HAS DROPPED AT A FASTER CLIP. THAN MEN SINCE THE EARLY SPRING SO WE KNOW IT'S SIMPLE MATHEMATICS IS ONLY SO MANY CHILD CARE CENTERS. THAT ARE SERVING KIDS RIGHT NOW IF WE DON'T PROBABLY FIND THEM PEOPLE CAN'T GO BACK TO WORK SO ONE OF THE GREAT ELEMENTS OF THIS BUDGET IS WE PRE ALLOCATE MONIES ARE GOING TO GET FROM THE NEXT ROUND OF KERR'S ACT. TO BOLSTER UP OUR CHILD CARE EXPERIENCE LOTS AND PROVIDE STIPENDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE CENTERS FINANCIALLY PENCIL OUT. AS FAR AS THE ISSUES FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS I WANT ADDRESS THIS WHOLE EIGHTY A THING. BECAUSE REALLY IT'S A FALLACY THAT WERE HARMING. ONE PARTICULAR TYPE OF SCHOOL THAT'S NOT TRUE. MY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SACRAMENTO THE THOMAS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO FACE A BIT OF A HIT TO BECAUSE THERE ARE GROWING DISTRICT IT'S NOT ABOUT. ANTI CHARTER SCHOOLS IT'S ABOUT HOW MANY STUDENTS YOU HAVE IN THE SCHOOL TODAY. SO REALLY THIS IS A TRADE OFF WE WANT HELP NINETY PERCENT. OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS STAY AFLOAT. AND HAVE A TEMPORARY HICK UP 410% FOR ONE YEAR DURING THIS HOLD HARMLESS EIGHTY EIGHT. NOW TO TRADE UP WE HAD TO MAKE WE CAN UNDO THIS. BUT WE HAVE TO GO DO MORE DEFERRALS ARE DIP INTO THE TO THE RAINY DAY FUND IS ONLY SO MUCH MONEY THAT GOES AROUND SO IT'S NOT LIKE THIS HARMS. ONE TYPE OF SCHOOL I WILL SAY WE HEAR THIS LOUD AND CLEAR MY COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON TALKED ABOUT A DISTRICT IN HER AREA THAT'S DOUBLED IN POPULATION LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF A NEW. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THIS IS AROUND THE DATE WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS WE HAD A HEARING THIS MORNING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID THERE AWARE OF IT. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THAT WE- KEEP THE SCHOOLS OF. MY MONEY THIS ISSUE IN THE TIME MONTHS. THE ISSUE THE DISTANCE LEARN AND THE LACK OF CLARITY. WE BROUGHT THIS UP MORNING IN THIS. AND UPS THE PHONE BUDGET CAN JUST. AND THEY'LL ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS WE ARE GOING TO SEE. A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL CLARIFYING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS. A LANGUAGE IN SB NINETY EIGHT RELATED DISTANCE LEARNING. THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS OF SARS WHAT AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT RECEIVES. UP THAT A NUMBER OF PARENTS TO SAY HEY I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE CLASS AND I WANT TO BE FULLY. ONLINE DISTANCE LEARNING WITH THE BE PROHIBITED FROM DOING THAT- THAT'S NOT CERTAINLY THE INTENT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CLARIFIED THAT SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL ABOUT THAT AS WELL. THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE ALERT TO THAT YOU'RE NOT RELATED TO LAY OFF THERE IS SOME CONFUSION ABOUT LAYOFFS DURING THIS. A COVERT NINETEEN IN A TIME PERIOD SEE THE NEXT. DAYS LASTLY. AS FAR AS- HIGHER EDUCATION THIS. MAKE SURE WE KEEP OUR UC AND CSU SYSTEMS A FULL OUT IF WE GET FEDERAL FUNDING WHICH WE ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC WILL HAPPEN YOU SEE AND SO YOU STILL GET A 5% INCREASE OVER LAST YEAR'S FUNDING FOR UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE FULLY FUND ARE CAL GRANT PROGRAM WE REALIZE THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE THE WORK COURSE OF OUR OUR OUR HIGHER IT'S SYSTEM WE MAKE SURE WE FULLY FUND THE APPORTIONMENT AND KEEP GOING THAT WITH OUR COMMUNITY CALLED SYSTEM- WITH THAT OVERALL THIS WASN'T A PERFECT SITUATION BUT IS WAY WAY BETTER THAN WE HAD NAY. AND THE SCHOOL THIS IS ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE EMBRACING THE PLAN WE HAVE BEFORE THAT BEFORE US TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MATTERS MEMBERS I'D RISE IN GREAT HAS A TWO. AND WE- IN SUPPORT AS WE- NINETY EIGHT. I KNOW IT'S THE TO CREATE A BUT- AND IT'S AN AND I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS WHEN YOU'VE GOT SO MANY FACTORS. FACTIONS FIGHTING FOR THE NICKELS AND DIMES AT A BEER- I THINK THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAD WHEN WE STARTED IN MAY. BUT LIKE MOST OF US REALIZE IT'S NOT ENOUGH. AND WE'VE LEFT OUT SOME IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS- I'M HOPEFUL THAT THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE RAISED THE ISSUE. ABOUT UNDERPERFORMING SCHOOLS AN UNDERPERFORMING CHILDREN AND WHAT NEEDS TO DO THAT YOU WILL KEEP THAT PASSION. THE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND AS AS YOU LOOK AT YOUR LEGISLATION AND AS YOU FIGHT FOR THE THINGS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT- IT IS PAINFUL TO ME TO HAVE ANY CHILD NOT. ACTUALLY FUNDED. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME REALLY WONDERFUL SCHOOLS THAT ARE WORKING VERY HARD. AND HAVE ATTRACTED STUDENTS TO THOSE SCHOOLS AND WILL NOT GET THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO MOVE FORWARD. WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE THEM WHEN IT COMES TO AUGUST. IN SEPTEMBER IF WE HAVE RESOURCES LEFT OVER. WE MUST MAINTAIN THAT FOCUS THAT'S THERE. YOU'RE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE ARE. WHEN I THERE IS A IT. LIKE THE FIRST THING WE DO IS WE TALK ABOUT IT SHE BEGAN. WE TALKED ALL THOSE KIDS ARE BEHIND. AND YET I. COMPASS MAYBE NOW WITH EVERY BUT WITH. MAJORITY YOU RE. CONCERNING THE MY THAT WOULD FOR. BAY LEARNING. AND EVERYBODY. THAT THEY DID NOT SAY THAT'S GO TO THE KID WHO REALLY HAVE THE LEARNING LOS. THE ONES WHO ARE BEHIND THE ONES WHO WE KNOW HAVE NOT. TURNED ON THEIR THEIR THEIR REPORT THEIR COMPUTERS TO LEARN- AND NOT NECESSARILY GIVEN TO THE KIDS. THAT HAVE DOING QUITE WELL BUT EVERYBODY WANTED THAT MONEY. EVERYBODY WAS THAT MONEY. AND SO AS A RESULT NO ONE WAS WILLING TO SACRIFICE. TO BASICALLY TAKE THAT MONEY THAT CAME IN FROM OVER. TO TALK ABOUT LEARNING LOSS. AND PUT IT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY HAVE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF LOS. BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTED AT THAT TIME. SO WHAT I HEAR YOU TELL ME ABOUT CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. MAKING SURE THAT EVERY KID HAS WHAT THEY NEED IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY ARE. I KNOW THAT IS SOMETIMES JUST EMPTY RHETORIC. BECAUSE THEN WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THE CUTTING UP. AND THE THINGS THAT ARE DIVVIED UP. THOSE KIDS STILL DON'T HAVE A VOICE IN ON THIS HOUSE THE THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN. SO I JUST WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU TO BASICALLY. KEEP THAT. GOING KEEP YOUR COMMITMENT. REALIZING THAT WHEN YOU MAKE THOSE COMMITMENTS YOU ALSO HAVE TO MAKE THE FINANCIAL INVESTMENT AS WELL. AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LOSE SOMETHING. IN ORDER TO GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO. WE HAVE NEVER PRIORITIZE KIDS WILL BE FINE IN THIS HOUSE. THAT I HAVE SEEN. WE TALK ABOUT IT. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. CHANGING OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM NOTHING NEEDED TO. WE GET WE GET WE GET ALL OF THE PLACE WITH WHERE WE TO BE. WE CAN FIVE EVERY. IN FELL. THEN THE EDUCATE. AFTER WE BASICALLY GIVE OF DO THINGS. A UNIQUE AND REVOLUTIONARY. WILL NOT BE WITH THE MOST CRITICAL IN. FACING CALIFORNIA AND IS NOT COLD IT IT IS. EVERY IN QUE. TO THE MAXIMUM. AND WE HAVE HAVE GIVEN UP ON THAT SO MANY WAYS. SO I'M I'M- IT'S POINT AT THE HOUSE WHEN A PLAN. TO REALLY BROUGH CAL. EDGE FORWARD. I'VE TALKED MANY OF YOU EDUCATE ME SAY WE ALL DO IT. WHICH KNOW OUR HEART OF TO DO BE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO. THE MY- AND MANY OF YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGHT THOSE MONSTERS. THOSE LITTLE. THOSE GROUPS THAT HOLD YOU TIGHT. AND SO AS A RESULT WE'VE BEEN. BASICALLY DO WE HAVE TO DO. SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE BEST WE CAN GET AT THIS POINT. IN TERMS OF US MOVING FORWARD BUT I HOPE YOU DON'T FORGET. AND I HOPE YOU HOLD TIGHT TO IT. BECAUSE EVERY TIME I WE WILL FOR BY JUMPED OVER THE BUT WHAT BY KATE. WHAT IS PROP TWO OH NINE. WELL ABOUT K. TWELVE. I FIGHT WILL CLICK TWELVE AND YUP WE TOGETHER AND THE BY. LINE IS THIS. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT NOW. AND TRY TO THROW. THE OTHER CASE ARMY I'M NOT LIST BECAUSE I WHEN RUN MEETS THE- YOU'RE NOT THERE. OF THE TIME. IF SO WANT YOU TO UNDER. THAT THIS THERE SHOULD BE A MOVE. ABOUT IT IS AND OUR CHILDREN THAT ARE IN THIS DAY. BUT I'M NOT GETTING THE RE. THEY NEED. AND IF FOLKS OF TO THIS. THAT ARE SIX. WE NEED TO ASK HER. WHY NOT KILL THEM ALL. BUT BASICALLY MIMICKED THE WHEN A LEARNED THEIR SIX. SO I SAY THIS A DAY BECAUSE- IS MUST. NO YOU THINK. NOT ALSO IN OTHERS I CARE ALL THOSE THINGS AND- JEFF ISSUE. BUT I KNOW THAT WE RUN A FROM TWELVE AT. EVERY TIME WE A CHANCE. TO MAKE SYSTEMIC. REAL THAT WILL ENSURE THE AT THE OF EVERY. SO I'VE YOU YOU'LL VOTE CONTRA TODAY I'M OPEN EIGHT BECAUSE IS WHAT THE- WE GO GET IT THIS MOMENT. BUT YOU SHOULD NOT BE UP ON THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT DONE WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

MR MAILING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU AGAIN MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS WE ARE TRULY EXPERIENCING UNPRECEDENTED TIMES WHILE THE CUPBOARD PANDEMIC CONTINUES WITH NO END IN SIGHT SO DOES CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AND A LOOMING WILDFIRE SEASON I AM PRESENTING A CA ELEVEN AS A COMPROMISE REPLACEMENT MEASURE TO THE MEASURE WHICH PREVIOUSLY QUALIFY BUT NOW HAS BEEN PULLED FROM THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. THE CCA ELEVEN ENSURES THAT FUNDING FOR FIRE PROTECTION A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE STRENGTHENED AND PROTECTED IT ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBILITY IN REFORM AND FAIRNESS IN CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTY TAX FORMULAS WHAT LEAVING THE PROTECTIONS OF PROPOSITION THIRTEEN INTACT THIS MEASURE CONTAINS SEVERAL PROVISIONS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE STOCK OF AVAILABLE HOUSING. AND PROVIDE PROTECTIONS TO VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS IN THE HOUSING MARKET WHILE CREATING PROTECTED REVENUE FOR UNDERFUNDED FIRE DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ENSURING THE COUNTIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECEIVE EQUITABLE FUNDING PROPOSITIONS FIFTY EIGHT AND ONE NINETY THREE CREATED A MECHANISM FOR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS TO TRANSFER THEIR HOMES TO THEIR CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN WITHOUT THOSE HOMES HAVING THEIR PROPERTY TAX REASSESSED. HIS PER OF THOSE PROPOSITIONS THESE EXCLUSIONS HAVE BEEN ROUTINELY EXPLOITED BY WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AS A TOOL FOR MANY TO WHAT A SECT OR FOR ALMOST THAT FOR THE BEING SET IT UP WORDS IN HERE THOSE ADDITIONAL PRIMARY HOMES ALSO INHERITING THE ARRAY TAX. LET ME EMPHASIZE ACA ELEVEN WILL PROTECT. BECAUSE WHEN FAMILIES NUMBER IS GOING TO TREAT AT PROPERTY AS A PRICE. RESIDENCE IT WILL CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE FOR VACATION HOMES AND OTHER USES THAT TO NOT INCLUDE A PRIMARY RESIDENCE AGAIN ACA ELEVEN PROTECTS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. OF PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS TO PASS THE FAMILY HOME TO THEIR CHILDREN ENSURING THAT THEIR HEIRS CAN AFFORD TO MOVE INTO THAT HOME AS THEIR PRIMARY. RESIDENCE BY CLOSING THE LOOPHOLES ON ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES PROSPECTIVELY THE STATE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR FIRE PROTECTION EMERGENCY SERVICES. CRITICAL LOCAL PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THE HOMELESS TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE TO HELP FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACROSS THE STATE. AC ELEVEN WILL OPEN UP TENS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR RENTERS AND FIRST TIME HOME OWNERS BY ALLOWING THOSE THAT QUALIFY AND WOULD LIKE TO SELL THEIR HOME BUT CANCER DUE TO BEING UNABLE TO FOR THE PROPERTY TAXES ON A NEW HOME. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AS A RESULT OF INCREASED DEMAN A CA ELEVEN WILL SPUR HOUSING CONSTRUCTION ALL INCOME LEVELS TO ACCOMMODATE THE DEMAND FOR HOUSING STATEWIDE. ACA LEVIN CONTINUES TO PROTECT SENIORS PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES FAMILIES OF VICTIMS OF WILDFIRE BY LIMITING PROPERTY TAX INCREASES ON PRIMARY RESIDENCES. AC ELEVEN ALSO REMOVES UNFAIR LOCATION RESTRICTIONS FROM PROPOSITIONS SIXTY AND NINETY. THUS ALLOWING THOSE THAT ARE QUALIFIED TO MOVE TO ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA AND RETAIN THEIR BASE YOUR VALUE PROPERTY TAX PORTABILITY. REMOVING THESE RESTRICTIONS WILL ALLOW OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS TO MOVE CLOSER TO FAMILY OR MEDICAL CARE TO A SENIOR RETIREMENT COMMUNITY ORTO REPLACE A DAMAGED HOME ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE NEW FUNDING GENERATED BY A CA ELEVEN WILL PLAY A ROLE IN OUR STATES ECONOMIC RECOVERY FROM THE COLD WITH NINETEEN PANDEMIC WITH LONG TERM REVENUE ESTIMATE ESTIMATED TO BE OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. ACA ELEVEN DEDICATES TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY O HISTORICALLY UNDERFUNDED FIRE DISTRICTS IN BOTH RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES WHILE ALSO PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRE RESPONSE WHICH WILL HELP PROTECT MILLIONS OF HOMES AND MILLIONS OF LIVES. AND FINALLY THE AMENDMENT PROVIDES LOCAL REVENUE TO COUNTIES CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS BY GENERATING STABLE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE FOR EVERY COUNTY ACROSS CALIFORNIA AT A TIME WHEN COUNTY IS NEEDED THE MOST. OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE A C. ELEVEN PROTECTS COUNTIES AGAINST ANY POTENTIAL REVENUE LOSS FROM THOSE THAT MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTY. BY ESTABLISHING AN OFFSET FUND WHICH WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REVENUE PROTECTION YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT TO ENSURE LOCAL GENERAL FUND STABILITY MEMBERS LET US SUBMIT TO THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION THIS COMPROMISE MEASURE WHICH IS A TWO HOUSE. MULTI PARTY SOLUTION I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MIND MR COOLEY ARE YOU SEEKING RECOGNITION REAR CHAMBER YES MISTER COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS. YOU KNOW IS THERE ON THIS FLOOR WE TALK ABOUT CERTAIN PHENOMENON THAT WE SEE HAPPENING IN THE WORLD WE GET CONCERNED ABOUT. WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE ECONOMY HAS CHANGED. EVERYONE FACES MUCH MORE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY IN THE WORLD TODAY. PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION OF LOST PENSIONS. WE ARE MORE RESEARCH MORE AT RISK IN RETIREMENT WE TALK ABOUT KIDS WHO ACTUALLY WILL NOT EARN MORE THAN THEIR PARENTS. SO MUCH MORE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND COMPLEXITY IN THE WORLD TODAY. THIS IS A FREQUENT REFRAIN ON THIS BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT ALL OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND I'M IS ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS ONE TOOL. IN THE PARENTS TOOL KIT. THAT IS SO SIMPLE. TO IMPROVE THE LIFE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THAT IS THE PROP THIRTEEN THE THIS ABILITY TO CONVEY YOUR- TAX BASIS IN YOUR PROPERTY. TO YOUR KIDS. BY YEAH AT THE TIME OF YOUR DEATH. IT WAS FULLY WITHIN THE CONTEMPLATION OF PROP. WHEN THIS WAS ORIGINALLY PASSED I REMEMBER THAT DEBATE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX. ARM BECAUSE IT COVERED THE WHOLE MEN OTHER PROPERTY AFTER MILLION DOLLARS SORT ALWAYS HAD CONTEMPLATION MORE THAN ONE PROPERTY. IT WAS A MECHANISM PERMIT PARENTS. TO CONVEY SOMETHING IN ON TO THEIR KIDS AND I WOULD SAY THIS FLEXIBILITY ESTABLISHED BY THIS LONG CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE FEW TOOLS LEFT IN THE POPULAR TOOL KIT. DID ANYBODY. WITH A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION OR LESS. CAN TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN THIS MEASURE WILL BREAK THAT UP BY IMPOSING THIS RESIDENCE REQUIREMENT DON'T THINK THAT MAKES SENSE. I ALSO NOTE THAT. THEY'LL SAY BUT THEY CAN EXERCISE IT. THERE OWNERSHIP RIGHT WITHOUT PENALTY FOR A YEAR. WELL WE'RE AND COLD IN THERE SAYING THAT OUR ECONOMY MAY NOT RECOVER FOR THREE YEARS I THINK OF THE EXAMPLE OF MY OWN FAMILY. MY PARENTS BOUGHT. BOUGHT A WHOLE NINETEEN SEVENTY ON THE MONTEREY PENINSULA MY DAD DIED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE. MY MOM DIED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. I'M THE YOUNGEST OF FOUR BOYS. TWO OF MY BROTHERS OWN HOMES ON THAT SAME TOWN WAS A ROLE BIGGER HOME. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE INTO MY PARENTS HOME. I'M UP IN SACRAMENTO I'M NOT MOVING INTO MY PARENTS HOME. MY OLDEST BROTHER IS A PASTOR IN CANADA HE MOST ASSUREDLY IS NOT MOVING AT ALL. BUT THAT WAS TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THAT WAS RIGHT AT THE START. ONE OF THE BIGGEST DOWNTURNS IN RECENT DECADES. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ACTUALLY HERE IN CENTRAL COUNTY WAS THE YEAR THAT I ORGANIZED. WORKSHOPS IN ENGLISH SPANISH AND RUSSIAN IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TO HELP MY RESIDENTS DIRECTOR OF A DEAL WITH THE DOWNTURN. BUT IT TOOK SEVERAL YEARS FOR PROPERTY VALUES TO BE RECOUP SO A ONE YEAR LIMITATION. WHAT A FORCED US TO SELL THE PROPERTY IN A DOWNTURN. WHICH IS ADVERSE TO OUR INTERESTS I'M NOT SAYING THERE ISN'T SOME POTENTIAL IN THIS BUT I ACTUALLY FEEL IS NOT DRAFT WITH A VIEW TO DO CERTAIN TYPES OF FAMILIES. THE EASE OF PASSING ON ECONOMIC VALUE TO YOUR KIDS. AND IF YOU THINK THAT THIS IS A DIFFERENT POSITION I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU JUST HEARD. WE ARE GOING TO ENABLE. FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY MOVES IN TRANSFER IN THE BASED TAXATION FOR THE PARENTS. WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR FIRE FIGHTING FOR CAL FIRE WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR UNDER FUNDER FIRE AGENCIES AND IF PEOPLE CHOOSE TO MOVE TO ONE OF THE OTHER FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES WE'RE GOING TO BACK FILL THAT COUNTY. WHERE THE HECK IS ALL THAT MONEY COMING FROM. BUT PERRY IN BACK THE ABILITY OF PERRANCE TO GIVE IT ON TO THEIR KIDS I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE FAMILY FARM PIECE I THINK IS VERY ADANTAGEOUS. THE FAMILY FARMS HAVE MANY OF MY DISTRICT I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT IS ADVANTAGEOUS. BUT THIS IS A MAJOR HERE. UPON THE ABILITY OF ANY PARENT IN CALIFORNIA. WHO IN GOOD TIMES AND BAD AS STRUGGLE TO HOLD ON TO THEIR HOME. PAY THEIR BILLS KNOWING THAT IT CAN GO TO THEIR KIDS. IT'S A MAJOR RE DOING OF AN IRAQI IS VERY BASIC EXPECTATIONS Y. URGENT OFF A NOBLE. THANK YOU MISTER COOLEY MYSTERY MAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF A CA ELEVEN FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO AGREE- COMPLETELY WITH MY OF VARIOUS TEAM MEMBER FROM RANCHO CORDOVA AND THAT THIS IS A VERY RELIABLE WAY. FOR PARENTS TO PASS ASSETS ON TO THEIR CHILDREN IN FACT IT'S SO RELIABLE BUT THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT HELP. IN PROTECTING AND CONSOLIDATING WEALTH IN CALIFORNIA. AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN BORN INTO A FAMILY THAT OWNS PROPERTY. NOT ONLY ARE THEY GOING TO NOW IN HER AT THAT PROPERTY BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING FOR THAT PRIVILEGE THEY WON'T HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING. IN TAXES TO HELP SUPPORT THEIR COMMUNITIES NOW IF YOU ARE THE PERSON THAT HE MENTIONED WHO WORKS HARD THEIR WHOLE LIFE AND STRUGGLES. AND SUCCEEDS AND CAN PURCHASE THAT SAME PROPERTY YOU NOT ONLY HAVE TO PAY YOUR SHARE OF TAXES BUT YOU'RE GOING TO PAY THAT SHARE OF TAXES FOR THAT LUCKY INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS BORN INTO THAT. PRIVILEGE AND THAT WEALTH BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT PORTION TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR AND NOT BECAUSE THEY BURNED IT. BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE BORN INTO A FAMILY THAT ALREADY HAD IT. OUT INHERITING A HOUSE THAT YOUR PARENTS OWN TONIGHT YOU GREW UP IN AND YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO IS EXEMPT. FROM THIS LEGISLATION. YOU CAN DO THAT AND MAINTAIN THAT PROPERTY BASE THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO SELL THAT FAMILY HOUSE. BUT MY GOODNESS IF I HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO BEEN BORN INTO A FAMILY WHICH I WASN'T. THAT WAS GOING TO PASS ME A COUPLE OF STRIP MALLS. I'M A SHOPPING MALL SOME GAS STATIONS A COUPLE DRY CLEANERS. I'D ALREADY BE THRILLED. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'D BE HAPPY TO PAY MY PORTION INTO MY COMMUNITY. AND HELP FLATTEN THAT BASE THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO WHO ARE ABLE TO PURCHASE THAT BECAUSE THEY SUCCEED ON THEIR OWN. MAYBE BRING THEIR PROPERTY TAXES DOWN A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE PAYING THE FULL BURDEN OF WHAT THAT WEALTHY PERSON IS NOT PAYING. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WEALTH HAS CONSOLIDATED IN THE STATE WHY THE RICH ARE GETTING RICHER AND WHY THE POOR ARE GETTING POORER. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO HELP FLATTEN THAT OUT A LITTLE BIT WE'RE NOT TAKING ANYONE'S PROPERTY AWAY WE'RE NOT STOPPING THEM FROM AND HEARD. FROM THAT PROPERTY BUT THEY SHOULD BE PAYING AT LEAST THEIR FAIR SHARE. AND RIGHT NOW THEY ARE NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE AYE URGENT A YES VOTE ON A C. ELEVEN. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN.
