CONSENT FOR THEIR OWN TREATMENT.

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:49.448 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.483 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

00:25:49.448 --> 00:25:53.352 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATION WOULD GIVE

MINORS WHEN NECESSARY. AND

00:25:53.352 --> 00:25:57.256 region:rollup2

COURSE OF THEIR LIVES.

00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:09.668 region:rollup2
RECENT EXAMPLES OF THIS INCLUDE

00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:11.170 region:rollup2
A SITUATION WHERE A SEVENTEEN

00:26:09.668 --> 00:26:14.173 region:rollup2
YEAR OLD WAS CONSIDERING

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:16.275 region:rollup2
MILITARY SERVICE AND SHE WAS IN

00:26:14.173 --> 00:26:16.742 region:rollup2
THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. SHE HAD

00:26:16.275 --> 00:26:18.944 region:rollup2
BEEN TO NUMEROUS HOMES

00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:20.546 region:rollup2
THEREFORE.

00:26:18.944 --> 00:26:23.782 region:rollup2
WITH NUMEROUS TREATMENT

00:26:20.546 --> 00:26:27.419 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND THERE WERE.

00:26:23.782 --> 00:26:28.620 region:rollup2
DISCREPANCIES AS TO VARYING IN

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:30.022 region:rollup2
CONFLICTING DIAGNOSES.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.657 region:rollup2
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU

HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE

00:26:31.657 --> 00:26:36.762 region:rollup2
CONTEXT TO THE RECORD BEFORE IT

00:26:35.027 --> 00:26:38.564 region:rollup2
WENT TO THE MILITARY.

00:26:36.762 --> 00:26:40.232 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THE LAW DOES NOT

00:26:38.564 --> 00:26:42.167 region:rollup2
ALLOW THAT TO OCCUR.

00:26:40.232 --> 00:26:44.703 region:rollup2
ANOTHER EXAMPLE.

00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:47.840 region:rollup2

THE RECORD WHEN SHE INSPECTED

00:26:50.576 --> 00:26:54.179 region:rollup2
THE RECORD SHE NOTED THAT.

00:26:53.045 --> 00:26:55.647 region:rollup2
THE PREVIOUS THERAPIST IN

00:26:54.179 --> 00:26:57.749 region:rollup2
INDICATED THAT SHE HAD TAKEN A

00:26:55.647 --> 00:26:59.151 region:rollup2
DRUG THAT SHE HAD NEVER USED

00:26:57.749 --> 00:27:01.520 region:rollup2
SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.

00:26:59.151 --> 00:27:02.654 region:rollup2
INACCURACIES SUCH AS THOSE ARE

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.288 region:rollup2
PRETTY IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:05.591 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO.

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:06.825 region:rollup2

I BELIEVE SPEAKING IN

OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL BUT THEY

01:01:48.672 --> 01:01:52.509 region:rollup2
ARE CORRECT THAT THESE HOMES ARE

PROTECTED UNDER CALIFORNIAN

01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:56.279 region:rollup2

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:57.681 region:rollup2
CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTION WAS IT

INDIVIDUALS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

01:01:59.182 --> 01:02:03.053 region:rollup2

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:05.922 region:rollup2
AGAINST THEM IS REAL.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:07.357 region:rollup2

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:15.699 region:rollup2
AT THEIR COUNTY COUNCIL'S

01:02:13.263 --> 01:02:17.767 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION THE LAWCLARIFIES

01:02:15.699 --> 01:02:19.269 region:rollup2
THAT CERTIFY HOMES ARE DEEMED TO

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:23.907 region:rollup2
AND MUST BE TREATED THE SAME AS

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:26.476 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD HELP TO ADDRESS

01:02:24.975 --> 01:02:28.378 region:rollup2

SOBER LIVING CAPACITY.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.217 region:rollup2
IT WILL PERMIT GOOD PROVIDERS TO

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:36.152 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIATE THEIR SERVICES.

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:37.120 region:rollup2
AND GIVE THEM ASSURANCES THAT

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:39.155 region:rollup2
THEIR FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS WILL

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:41.024 region:rollup2
BE RESPECTED.

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:43.360 region:rollup2

CORNERSTONE TO OUR WORK AT

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:03.233 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT.

01:05:00.697 --> 01:05:05.668 region:rollup2

.

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:31.294 region:rollup2
IT'S SO WHILE MANY OF THE IN

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:32.962 region:rollup2
YOUR ANALYSIS I THINK DOES A

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:35.131 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD JOB IN LAYING OUT.

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:36.933 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:38.401 region:rollup2
REPEATEDLY COME BEFORE.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:40.437 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:43.306 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES IN THE LEGISLATURE.

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:44.374 region:rollup2
TO TRAIN RESTRICT THOSE LIVING

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:47.443 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENTS.

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:50.280 region:rollup2
RIVER LIVING RESIDENTS FOR

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:52.081 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITIES

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:54.284 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:54.984 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO NOTE THAT INDEED

01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:56.886 region:rollup2
AND.

01:05:54.984 --> 01:05:58.922 region:rollup2
AS I THINK THE PROPONENTS OF

01:05:56.886 --> 01:06:00.156 region:rollup2
STATED THESE ARE HOME SWEET

01:05:58.922 --> 01:06:01.891 region:rollup2
THESE ARE RESIDENTS AS

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:04.327 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AND

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:06.863 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE RESIDENTS AS.

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:09.265 region:rollup2
THEY ARE PROTECTED BY BOTH THE

01:06:06.863 --> 01:06:12.101 region:rollup2
STATE AND FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING.

01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:13.436 region:rollup2
LAW SO I I WANTED TO JUST MAKE

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:14.971 region:rollup2
TWO POINTS REALLY.

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:17.740 region:rollup2
ABOUT ITS.

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:20.009 region:rollup2
FAIR HOUSING LAW AND AND HOW

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:22.445 region:rollup2
THIS RENTS A STRAY I I THINK THE

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:25.081 region:rollup2
EFFORT THAT THE EFFORT IN THIS

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:26.950 region:rollup2
BILL IS TO PUT A LABEL ON THIS

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:28.117 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS A VOLUNTARY

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:29.752 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION.

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:32.655 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:35.091 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARY CERTIFICATION ESCAPES

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:38.061 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE

01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:40.463 region:rollup2
FAIR HOUSING ACT IN ENSURING

01:06:38.061 --> 01:06:41.497 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS NOT DISCRIMINATION

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:43.766 region:rollup2
AGAINST PERSONS. WITH

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:45.368 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES AND SELECTING THE

01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:46.870 region:rollup2
PLACES THAT.

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:49.472 region:rollup2
THEY CAN.

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:51.841 region:rollup2
LIVE ESSENTIALLY IF YOU WERE TO

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:53.977 region:rollup2
ADOPT SUCH A PROVISION AS THE US

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:57.847 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD HAVE A STATE

01:06:53.977 --> 01:07:01.117 region:rollup2
SANCTIONED REGULATION. ON THE

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:03.119 region:rollup2
RESIDENCES FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:05.154 region:rollup2
AND WHILE IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:07.323 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT. THE.

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:09.392 region:rollup2
THE INDIVIDUAL HOMES ONCE YOU

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:12.061 region:rollup2
OPEN THE DOOR AND LOOKED TO THE

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:14.063 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INSIDE THOSE

01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:16.232 region:rollup2
HOMES AND IN THIS CASE.

01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:17.700 region:rollup2
PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:19.369 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHEN YOU STEP OVER THE

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:21.571 region:rollup2
LINE IS IN.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:23.273 region:rollup2
IN FAIR HOUSING SO WE WOULD.

01:07:21.571 --> 01:07:25.608 region:rollup2
SUMMIT THAT THIS.

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:27.644 region:rollup2
DOES NOT ONLY VIOLATE THE FAIR

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:30.847 region:rollup2
HOUSING ACT STATE FEDERAL FAIR

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:31.881 region:rollup2
HOUSING ACT BUT ALSO THE THE

01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:33.983 region:rollup2
EIGHTY A.

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:35.685 region:rollup2
AND I JUST WANTED ALSO MAKE NE

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:38.821 region:rollup2
OTHER POINT THAT THAT THE REAL

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:40.857 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE OF OF THIS BILL IS IS

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:43.293 region:rollup2
REALLY REPLETE WITH THE

01:07:40.857 --> 01:07:44.661 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. YOU

01:07:43.293 --> 01:07:47.830 region:rollup2
KNOW YOU GO THROUGH THIS LIST OF

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:50.033 region:rollup2
OF SIXTEEN OR MORE THAT GREATLY

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:53.336 region:rollup2
RESTRICTS THE ABILITY FOR

01:07:50.033 --> 01:07:55.672 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SEEKING TO.

01:07:53.336 --> 01:07:57.774 region:rollup2
JUST RESIDE WITH THOSE THAT THEY

01:07:55.672 --> 01:08:00.043 region:rollup2
WANT TO RESIDE WITH OR IF YOU

01:07:57.774 --> 01:08:03.179 region:rollup2
HAVE SMALLER SOBER LIVING.

01:08:00.043 --> 01:08:04.581 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS OPERATORS WHO CAN

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:07.350 region:rollup2
MEET EITHER THE.

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:08.685 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS FOR THAT THE COSTS

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:10.219 region:rollup2
OR THE WHOLE HOST OF

01:08:08.685 --> 01:08:10.853 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU'RE

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:12.989 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE.

01:08:10.853 --> 01:08:15.158 region:rollup2
THAT THIS BILL WOULD OTHERWISE

01:08:12.989 --> 01:08:17.694 region:rollup2
REQUIRE TO TO MEET THAT

01:08:15.158 --> 01:08:18.861 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS SO WE

01:08:17.694 --> 01:08:20.530 region:rollup2
WOULD URGE.

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:24.067 region:rollup2
YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK

01:08:20.530 --> 01:08:25.535 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:08:24.067 --> 01:08:26.569 region:rollup2
SECURE MY CAROL WITH THE

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:28.171 region:rollup2
WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:29.639 region:rollup2
POVERTY WE ALSO ARE HERE IN

01:08:28.171 --> 01:08:32.675 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TODAY.

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:34.210 region:rollup2
I'D JUST WANT TO KNOWLEDGE MEAN

01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:35.745 region:rollup2
THE WORK AT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:37.647 region:rollup2
AND ALL THE MEMBERS WHO ARE

01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:39.082 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE WE KNOW

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:40.883 region:rollup2
THAT THERE HAS BEEN.

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:43.386 region:rollup2
CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED IN

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:44.454 region:rollup2
RECENT YEARS BECAUSE. OF AN

01:08:43.386 --> 01:08:46.055 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN THE.

01:08:44.454 --> 01:08:47.323 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE AMOUNT OF DRUG

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:48.958 region:rollup2
TREATMENT THAT'S BEING OFFERED

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:50.526 region:rollup2
THAT'S PARTIALLY DUE TO THE

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:53.062 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REQUIREMENTS

01:08:50.526 --> 01:08:54.230 region:rollup2
REQUIRED INSURERS TO HAVE TO.

01:08:53.062 --> 01:08:55.565 region:rollup2
PAY FOR THAT COVERAGE WHICH IN

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:58.267 region:rollup2
GENERAL IS A GOOD THING.

01:08:55.565 --> 01:08:59.736 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY

01:08:58.267 --> 01:09:01.270 region:rollup2
THE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE HAVE

01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:03.239 region:rollup2
AN OPIOID CRISIS GOING ON. SO I

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:05.274 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THOSE TWO ISSUES HAVE

01:09:03.239 --> 01:09:06.409 region:rollup2
SORT OF DRIVEN IN A PUSHED A

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:07.744 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF MEMBERS TO TRY TO.

01:09:06.409 --> 01:09:09.846 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION TO THIS

01:09:07.744 --> 01:09:10.847 region:rollup2
AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T THINK

01:09:09.846 --> 01:09:13.016 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE ONE.

01:09:10.847 --> 01:09:14.250 region:rollup2
WE STAND IN CONCURRENCE WITH

01:09:13.016 --> 01:09:16.119 region:rollup2
THE COMMENTS OF DISABILITY

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:18.221 region:rollup2
RIGHTS CALIFORNIA I JUST WANTED

01:09:16.119 --> 01:09:20.757 region:rollup2
ADD A COUPLE OF OTHER.

01:09:18.221 --> 01:09:22.191 region:rollup2
NOTES TO MIKE THE COMMENTS FROM

01:09:20.757 --> 01:09:23.626 region:rollup2

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:28.898 region:rollup2
AS HE STATES THERE ARE ANNOYING
