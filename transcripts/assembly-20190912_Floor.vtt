IT COMES TO THE HOUSING CRISIS

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:16.964
EVEN WE TALK REGIONALLY IT'S

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:18.532
NOT ABOUT JUST WHAT ONE CITY

01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:42.290
MORE HOUSING THIS IS AN

01:32:42.356 --> 01:32:44.692
ADDITIONAL TOOL FOR US TO IS TO

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:46.827
DO THAT EVEN MORE SO THAN WE'VE

01:32:46.894 --> 01:32:48.195

THE QUESTION FROM A COLLEAGUE

01:33:21.729 --> 01:33:22.263
FROM CONCORD. SO THE WAY THIS%

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:23.631
PROCESS WORKS IS AS WE HAVE

01:33:23.698 --> 01:33:25.533
DONE IS A REGION. IN THE BAY

01:33:25.599 --> 01:33:26.334
AREA WHEN IT COMES TO

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.169
TRANSPORTATION FUNDING AS WE'VE

01:33:28.235 --> 01:33:30.671
DONE FOR BAY AREA RESTORATION.

01:33:30.738 --> 01:33:32.306
WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON TODAY'S TO

01:33:32.373 --> 01:33:34.642
AUTHORIZE THE POSSIBILITY THAT

01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:35.977
THE BAY AREA REGION COULD

01:33:36.043 --> 01:33:37.812
CONSIDER REVENUE MEASURES THAT

01:33:37.878 --> 01:33:39.113
THEY WOULD HAVE TO GET APPROVAL

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:40.781
FOR JUST PUT ON THE BALLOT.

01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:41.649
THEY HAVE TO GET APPROVAL FOR

01:33:41.716 --> 01:33:44.018
IT NOT JUST BY ONE BUT ACTUALLY

01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:44.652
TO REGIONAL BODIES IN THE BAY

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:47.088
AREA. THE WAY IT WOULD WORK IS

01:33:47.154 --> 01:33:48.556
THERE'S ONE REGIONAL BODY THAT

01:33:48.622 --> 01:33:49.890
IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS BEING

01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:51.625
REPRESENTED MORE HIGHLY BY.

01:33:51.692 --> 01:33:53.394
SMALLER SUBURBAN CITIES OF THE

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:55.129
TYPE THAT YOU REPRESENT AND OUR

01:33:55.196 --> 01:33:56.530
COLLEAGUE FROM AROUND A

01:33:56.597 --> 01:33:59.000
REPRESENTS. THAT IS A BACK

01:33:59.066 --> 01:34:00.768
THERE'S ANOTHER BODY M. T. C.

01:34:00.835 --> 01:34:02.069
THAT IS TYPICALLY VIEWED AS

01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:03.604
BEING A BIT MORE DOMINATED BY

01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:05.740
THE LARGER CITIES. BOTH BODIES

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:07.208
WOULD HAVE TO AGREE IN THE WAY

01:34:07.274 --> 01:34:09.744
THE PROCESS WORKS IS. A BAG.

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:12.113
WHICH IS VIEWED AS A BIT MORE

01:34:12.179 --> 01:34:13.547
DOMINANT BY AGAIN SMALLER

01:34:13.614 --> 01:34:15.750
SUBURBAN CITIES. THEY WOULD BE

01:34:15.816 --> 01:34:18.419
THE FIRST. INSTITUTION AS YOU

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:21.022
WILL TO PUT A PLAN TOGETHER. I

01:34:21.088 --> 01:34:23.257
THEY WOULD PROPOSE THE PLAN IF

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:25.726
THE MTC AGREES WITH IT. I THEN

01:34:25.793 --> 01:34:26.394
THAT WOULD BE THE PLAN THAT THE

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.129
VOTERS WITHIN CONSIDER IF THE

01:34:28.195 --> 01:34:30.164
MTC CHANGES THAT IN ANY WAY IT

01:34:30.231 --> 01:34:31.265
GOES BACK TO A BACK FOR

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:33.067
APPROVAL. SO A BAG GETS THE

01:34:33.134 --> 01:34:35.102
FIRST WORD AND THE LAST WORD

01:34:35.169 --> 01:34:36.203

01:34:42.309 --> 01:34:44.478
WANTED TO STATE THAT AGAIN

01:34:44.545 --> 01:34:45.913
THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF

01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:47.681
APPROVAL THAT WOULD HAVE TO GO

01:34:47.748 --> 01:34:48.549
THROUGH TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

GOES ON ALL THE TIME. I HAVEN'T

ON EVERY DAY. THINK ABOUT THAT

02:54:24.487 --> 02:54:26.389
THINK ABOUT TALKING TO A VICTIM

02:54:26.455 --> 02:54:27.023

02:54:30.626 --> 02:54:34.931
THAT IS NOT OKAY. SOME FOLKS

02:54:34.997 --> 02:54:35.464
NOT EVERYONE HAVE A REPEAT

02:54:35.531 --> 02:54:38.301

TALK ABOUT MONEY ANYTHING DONE

02:54:49.979 --> 02:54:51.447

02:54:57.053 --> 02:54:59.288
MITCHELL HIT YOUR HEAD AGAINST.

SIX IS A NARROW INCREMENTAL

02:56:38.287 --> 02:56:39.922
BILL AND IT IS NOT A RADICAL BE

02:56:39.989 --> 02:56:43.192
BUT AS POINTED OUT BY THE LA

02:56:43.259 --> 02:56:43.793
TIMES AND OTHER NEWSPAPERS IT

02:56:43.859 --> 02:56:44.927
IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BILL.

02:56:44.994 --> 02:56:49.999
YOU KNOW I UP. ONE OF THE

02:56:50.066 --> 02:56:53.202
TRAGEDIES OF SERVING ON THE ON

02:56:53.269 --> 02:56:53.903
MANY OF THE COMMITTEES

02:56:53.970 --> 02:56:55.871
PARTICULAR THE BUDGET COMMITTEE

02:56:55.938 --> 02:56:57.106
IS IT TO HAVE A TENDENCY YOU

02:56:57.173 --> 02:56:58.808
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT

02:56:58.874 --> 02:57:00.476
WHERE WE- PUT OUR RESOURCES AND

02:57:00.543 --> 02:57:02.945
OUR TIME AND OUR ENERGY. AND

02:57:03.012 --> 02:57:04.680
SURELY INCREASING PEOPLE'S TIME

02:57:04.747 --> 02:57:07.016
IN PRISON HAS COST US I'M A

02:57:07.083 --> 02:57:07.616
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN

02:57:07.683 --> 02:57:10.486
CALIFORNIA. BUT I WOULDN'T BE

02:57:10.553 --> 02:57:12.221
OPPOSED TO THAT IF IT ALSO IF

02:57:12.288 --> 02:57:13.622
IT PROVIDED US WITH SAFETY AND

02:57:13.689 --> 02:57:16.792
SECURITY. AND IT CREATED A

02:57:16.859 --> 02:57:19.328
SYSTEM THAT WAS AFFECTED.

02:57:19.395 --> 02:57:21.297
THAT'S PART NOT A PERSON ON

02:57:21.364 --> 02:57:22.098
THIS FLOOR WHO BELIEVES OUR

02:57:22.164 --> 02:57:24.000
CURRENT SYSTEM IS AFFECTED.

02:57:24.066 --> 02:57:25.701
THAT WE ACCOMPLISHING THE GOAL

02:57:25.768 --> 02:57:27.169
OF RESTORING PEOPLE BACK TO

02:57:27.236 --> 02:57:30.339
BEING LAW ABIDING CITIZENS AND

02:57:30.406 --> 02:57:30.906
THAT WE'RE GIVING THEM WHAT

02:57:30.973 --> 02:57:31.540
THEY NEED TO FUNCTION WHEN THEY

02:57:31.607 --> 02:57:33.976
LEAVE. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS

02:57:34.043 --> 02:57:35.811
MADE OURSELVES LOOK GOOD

02:57:35.878 --> 02:57:39.115
BECAUSE WERE HARD ON CRIME. AND

02:57:39.181 --> 02:57:40.483
HIT THE OTHER FACTS OF WHAT IS

02:57:40.549 --> 02:57:42.284
HAPPENING. AND SO WHEN YOU

02:57:42.351 --> 02:57:44.253
SERVE ON A BUDGET COMMITTEE AND

02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:45.621
YOU HAVE TO GIVE AN ADDITIONAL

02:57:45.688 --> 02:57:47.590
BILLION DOLLARS. TO THE PRISON

02:57:47.656 --> 02:57:50.026
SYSTEM THAT IS INEFFECTIVE.

02:57:50.092 --> 02:57:51.660
THAT IS REALLY WHERE HOUSING

02:57:51.727 --> 02:57:53.963
SOULS AND NOT REALLY MAKING A

02:57:54.030 --> 02:57:56.399
DIFFERENCE IT IS DIFFICULT.

02:57:56.465 --> 02:57:58.300
THIS BILL IS VERY NARROW

02:57:58.367 --> 02:57:58.868
COMPARED TO THE OTHER BILLS

02:57:58.934 --> 02:58:01.003
WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST. WE CAN

02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:02.605
TALK ABOUT VARIOUS ISSUES AND

02:58:02.671 --> 02:58:05.274
MOST PEOPLE LIKE TO HARP ON THE

02:58:05.341 --> 02:58:05.808
ISSUE OF WHAT OF DOMESTIC

02:58:05.875 --> 02:58:09.178
VIOLENCE. AND I SEE THE MESSAGE

02:58:09.245 --> 02:58:11.147
VIOLENCE UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL

02:58:11.213 --> 02:58:12.715
WHEN I SERVED ON A COUPLE

02:58:12.782 --> 02:58:14.350
BOARDS ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:58:14.417 --> 02:58:16.685
CENTER SO I'M NOT A PERSON WHO

02:58:16.752 --> 02:58:17.586
GIVES A LOT OF SLACK TO THOSE

02:58:17.653 --> 02:58:19.388
WHO ARE COMMITTING DOMESTIC

02:58:19.455 --> 02:58:22.591
VIOLENCE. BUT REST ASSURED THAT

02:58:22.658 --> 02:58:23.225
THE JUDGE STILL MEANS UNDER THE

02:58:23.292 --> 02:58:25.327
LAW THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO A

02:58:25.394 --> 02:58:26.829
VARIETY OF SENTENCE THINGS

02:58:26.896 --> 02:58:28.497
THAT'S THE- THIS HAS NOT

02:58:28.564 --> 02:58:30.766
CHANGED THEY CAN GIVE TO THREE

02:58:30.833 --> 02:58:31.967
OR FOUR YEARS SO THEY HAVE A

02:58:32.034 --> 02:58:33.269
CHOICE OF THE LAW THE MIDDLE

02:58:33.335 --> 02:58:35.704
AND HIGH. FOR FIRST OFFENDERS

02:58:35.771 --> 02:58:37.239
BUT SECOND OFFENDERS THEY HAVE

02:58:37.306 --> 02:58:39.875
THE OPPORTUNITY FOUR TO FOUR

02:58:39.942 --> 02:58:41.877
AND FIVE YEARS SO PEOPLE STILL

02:58:41.944 --> 02:58:43.646
GET GREATER SENTENCING IF THEY

02:58:43.712 --> 02:58:45.347
OF COMMITTEE SEC DOMESTIC

02:58:45.414 --> 02:58:47.483
VIOLENCE FOR THE SECOND TIME.

02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:49.318
AND THAT IS NOT TAKEN AWAY IN

02:58:49.385 --> 02:58:51.153
THIS BILL SO REST ASSURED THAT

02:58:51.220 --> 02:58:52.755
IS NOT TAKEN WHEN WE HEAR ALL

02:58:52.822 --> 02:58:54.757
THE HORROR STORIES AND THAT IS

02:58:54.824 --> 02:58:56.859
NOT THE CASE. THEY ALSO HAVE IF

02:58:56.926 --> 02:58:58.294
THEY'RE CONVICTED OF A FELONY

02:58:58.360 --> 02:59:02.932
ABUSE OF CHILDREN THIS TO ALSO

02:59:02.998 --> 02:59:05.367
HAS HIGHER SENTENCING DEPENDING

02:59:05.434 --> 02:59:06.669
UPON WHETHER THE FIRST SECOND

02:59:06.735 --> 02:59:09.605
CHANCE. AT IS YOUR TANK. THIS

02:59:09.672 --> 02:59:13.776
BILL. SO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT

02:59:13.843 --> 02:59:14.710
OFTENTIMES IS A PER TWO PEOPLE

02:59:14.777 --> 02:59:16.045
COMMITTED COMMITTING A FELONY.

02:59:16.112 --> 02:59:16.979
AND ONE GETS PROBATION AND

02:59:17.046 --> 02:59:18.547
ANOTHER GET SENTENCE. AND WE

02:59:18.614 --> 02:59:19.081
KNOW WHAT THE ETHNICITY OF

02:59:19.148 --> 02:59:21.817
THOSE TWO PEOPLE ARE. MORE THAN

02:59:21.884 --> 02:59:22.418
LIKELY ONE IS WHITE AND ONE IS

02:59:22.485 --> 02:59:25.387
BLACK. AND WHEN THEY COME BACK

02:59:25.454 --> 02:59:26.455
THE SECOND TIME IF THEY COMMIT

02:59:26.522 --> 02:59:28.524
THIS FELONY OFFENSE NOW THIS

02:59:28.591 --> 02:59:30.526
PERSON WHO IS INCARCERATED YES

02:59:30.593 --> 02:59:31.627
ADDITIONAL YEARS WITH THE

02:59:31.694 --> 02:59:32.862
PERSON WHO COMMITTED THE SAME

02:59:32.928 --> 02:59:34.430
OFFENSE AND GOT PROBATION

02:59:34.497 --> 02:59:35.865
BECAUSE THEY THEY HAD MONEY OR

02:59:35.931 --> 02:59:37.633
CONNECTIONS THEY'VE BEEN START

02:59:37.700 --> 02:59:39.401
OFF WITH THE LESSER OFFENSE. WE

02:59:39.468 --> 02:59:41.770
KNOW THE SYSTEM IS CORRUPT IT

02:59:41.837 --> 02:59:44.473
WAS DESIGNED TO TRY TO HARNESS

02:59:44.540 --> 02:59:46.408
ALL THE PROBLEMS WE HAD IN THE

02:59:46.475 --> 02:59:48.511
WOMAN O OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:59:48.577 --> 02:59:50.246
SYSTEM WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT

02:59:50.312 --> 02:59:52.748
THE HUMAN COST. AND WE STE THIS

02:59:52.815 --> 02:59:54.049
IS A NARROW BILL MUCH NEARER

02:59:54.116 --> 02:59:55.918
WITH MANY PEOPLE WHAT WHAT IS

02:59:55.985 --> 02:59:57.453
IT TO BE AND THERE ARE THAN

02:59:57.520 --> 02:59:59.021
PRIOR BILLS A DEALS WITH SENSE

02:59:59.088 --> 03:00:03.626
AND HANSON THIS THE BASICALLY

03:00:03.692 --> 03:00:06.428
TALKS ABOUT BASICALLY. ONE YEAR

03:00:06.495 --> 03:00:09.798
IN EXCELLENT. THE CHILD ABUSE

03:00:09.865 --> 03:00:10.733
AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE TAKEN

03:00:10.799 --> 03:00:11.734
OUT AND THEIR HANDLE SEPARATELY

03:00:11.800 --> 03:00:12.635
IN A DIFFERENT SECTION OF PENAL

03:00:12.701 --> 03:00:14.470
CODE AND IS NOT AFFECTED BY

03:00:14.537 --> 03:00:16.205
THIS BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE.

03:00:16.272 --> 03:00:18.007
THE BUILT ON ENHANCEMENTS BASED

03:00:18.073 --> 03:00:20.109
ON WHO'S COMMITTED THE CRIME IN

03:00:20.176 --> 03:00:21.143
AND WHETHER IT'S MORE THAN ONE

03:00:21.210 --> 03:00:24.213
TIME. I ASK YOU TO SOMETIMES

03:00:24.280 --> 03:00:24.747

RELATED TO YOU WHO MIGHT BE IN

03:00:29.318 --> 03:00:31.020
THE SAME SITUATION. ONE

FAMILIES OF YOUR COULD MEMBERS

03:00:31.687 --> 03:00:33.822
OF YOUR COMMUNITY. AND THINK

03:00:33.889 --> 03:00:35.191
ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE

03:00:35.257 --> 03:00:37.226
SOMETIMES ARE ADDING ON YEARS

03:00:37.293 --> 03:00:38.761
AND YEARS OF TWO PEOPLE'S

03:00:38.827 --> 03:00:41.096
LIVES. THAT WHERE THEY HAVE NOT

03:00:41.163 --> 03:00:42.198
COMMITTED THE WORST CRIME IN

03:00:42.264 --> 03:00:44.400
THE WORLD. BUT WITH BASED ON

03:00:44.466 --> 03:00:45.901
THIS THERE GIVEN THE ISSUE OF

03:00:45.968 --> 03:00:48.337
ENHANCEMENT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT

03:00:48.404 --> 03:00:50.172
OUR SYSTEM TREATS PEOPLE OF

03:00:50.239 --> 03:00:52.374
COLOR DIFFERENTLY AND IT IS NOT

03:00:52.441 --> 03:00:54.009
SOMETHING THAT WE MADE UP THIS

03:00:54.076 --> 03:00:55.945
IS SOMETHING THAT IS RECOGNIZED

03:00:56.011 --> 03:00:58.714
IN THE- IN THE LEGAL COMMUNITY.

03:00:58.781 --> 03:00:59.315
AND YET THEY HAVE NO ANSWER TO

03:00:59.381 --> 03:01:02.184
THE PROBLEM. WE GET THE HARDEST

03:01:02.251 --> 03:01:02.785
IN SAYING IF CHOICE BETWEEN

03:01:02.851 --> 03:01:04.720

FELONY NORMALLY IT'S A FELONY

03:01:06.655 --> 03:01:08.157
FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. IF THEY

03:01:08.224 --> 03:01:09.725
HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO THREE

03:01:09.792 --> 03:01:11.393

03:01:20.502 --> 03:01:23.639
SAFER. SO I WOULD ASK THAT YOU

03:01:23.706 --> 03:01:26.008

HAD THOSE THAT SPOKE IN

03:07:23.966 --> 03:07:26.168
SUPPORT. BECAUSE IT'S NOT EASY

03:07:26.234 --> 03:07:29.104
WHEN OPPOSITION. USES WHAT IS

03:07:29.171 --> 03:07:31.873
OFTEN TIMES USED. IN IN THESE

03:07:31.940 --> 03:07:33.141
TYPES OF WITH THESE TYPES OF

03:07:33.208 --> 03:07:35.310
BILLS IS FEAR. AND I GET THAT

03:07:35.377 --> 03:07:37.245
BECAUSE USING FEAR. MAKES A LOT

03:07:37.312 --> 03:07:38.914
MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

03:07:38.981 --> 03:07:39.514
ACTUALLY DO THE WORK THAT'S

03:07:39.581 --> 03:07:41.717
pNECESSARY TO CREATE A JUSTICE

03:07:41.783 --> 03:07:43.185
SYSTEM. THAT DOES WORK FOR

03:07:43.251 --> 03:07:44.953
EVERYONE AND THAT'S FAIR. I'M

03:07:45.020 --> 03:07:46.421
ASKING ALL YOU COLLEAGUES TO

03:07:46.488 --> 03:07:48.357
ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT THIS BILL

03:07:48.423 --> 03:07:49.791
ACTUALLY DOES NOT THE

03:07:49.858 --> 03:07:52.160
ANECDOTAL. COMMENTS FROM THOSE

03:07:52.227 --> 03:07:54.096
IN OPPOSITION. THAT SUGGEST

03:07:54.162 --> 03:07:55.163
SOMEHOW THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING

03:07:55.230 --> 03:07:56.932
TO GET AWAY WITH THINGS. THAT

03:07:56.999 --> 03:07:58.834
THAT THEY ARE FOUND GUILTY OF

03:07:58.900 --> 03:08:01.236
WHICH IS SIMPLY. NOT TRUE. WE

03:08:01.303 --> 03:08:03.839
KNOW. FOR EXAMPLE THAT IN THE-

03:08:03.905 --> 03:08:05.507
A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES REYES

03:08:05.574 --> 03:08:08.443
SPECIFIC TO. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

03:08:08.510 --> 03:08:10.312
AND CHILD ABUSE WELL. THERE'S

03:08:10.379 --> 03:08:14.683
ALREADY. OF THE MECHANISMS.

03:08:14.750 --> 03:08:15.484
THERE'S ALTERS ALTERNATIVE

03:08:15.550 --> 03:08:18.520
SENTENCING FOR EXAMPLE. ON

03:08:18.587 --> 03:08:19.454
THOSE THAT. ARE REPEAT ONLY

03:08:19.521 --> 03:08:23.158
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. PERPETRATORS

03:08:23.225 --> 03:08:26.995
OF THREE YEAR LONGER THAN A

03:08:27.062 --> 03:08:28.130
PERSON AT UNDER NOT TO MENTION

03:08:28.196 --> 03:08:34.136
THAT IS GREAT. THE INJURY. IN

03:08:34.202 --> 03:08:34.670
ADDITION A FIVE TOP OF THE

03:08:34.736 --> 03:08:42.144

03:08:42.210 --> 03:08:45.080
BOTH SING ALONG TO SOLVE AS

03:08:45.147 --> 03:08:47.783

WE'RE GETTING RID OF THIS FOR

03:08:51.520 --> 03:08:52.854
THOSE THAT PERPETRATE CHILD

03:08:52.921 --> 03:08:54.056
ABUSE OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

03:08:54.122 --> 03:08:56.558
BECAUSE THAT NATURALLY PULLS

03:08:56.625 --> 03:08:57.192
OUT ALL OF OUR HEARTSTRINGS WE

03:08:57.259 --> 03:08:59.194
WANT TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN WE

03:08:59.261 --> 03:08:59.828
WANT TO PROTECT THOSE THAT ARE

03:08:59.895 --> 03:09:01.396
VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

03:09:01.463 --> 03:09:03.765
AND- REMOVING SB ONE THIRTY SIX

03:09:03.832 --> 03:09:04.399
DOES NOT PREVENT US FROM DOING

03:09:04.466 --> 03:09:06.401
THAT IN FACT THE EXACT SAME

03:09:06.468 --> 03:09:09.071

ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKE. SURE THAT

03:09:27.389 --> 03:09:29.658
