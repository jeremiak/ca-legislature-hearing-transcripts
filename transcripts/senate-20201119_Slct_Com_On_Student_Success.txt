I WILL INTRODUCE ALL THE WITNESSES FOR DAYS TODAY'S HEARING IN A FEW MINUTES BUT I DO WANT TO EXTEND A SPECIAL WELCOME TO SENATOR RICHARD ROTH. WHO HAS CHAIRED THE BUDGET SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER ONE ON EDUCATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY SENATE ROTH. THE ISSUE OF ON TIME COLLEGE GRADUATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMITTEE BUT IT'S EVEN MORE SO TODAY AS WE COPE WITH THE PANDEMIC. A GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT HAS AFFECTED EVERYONE IN SO MANY WAYS. I WANT TO FIRST OFFER MY- THOUGHTS AND CONDOLENCES TO EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN PERSONALLY AFFECTED BY COVERT NINETEEN- WE- MOURN YOUR LOSSES IN SOME CASES THE DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES SET THEIR DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES IN ALL CASES. DEALING WITH THIS DREADED DISEASE. OUR BATTLE TO CREATE BETTER CONDITIONS FOR COLLEGE STUDENT SUCCESS PARTICULARLY AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS. HAS BEEN ONGOING SINCE THIS COMMITTEE WAS FORMED FOUR YEARS AGO. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW YEARS THE CSU AND THE LEGISLATURE I'M HAPPY TO SAY HAVE PARTNERED TOGETHER TO IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES. LET ME GIVE YOU A BIT OF HISTORY IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE CSU BEGAN WORKING ON CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP THAT ASK CAMPUS IS TO INCREASE THEIR SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATES. AND AFTER SEEN MANY IMPROVEMENTS AND I GOT TO SEE THEM FIRST HAND AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES- AND AFTER CONSULTATION WITH CAMPUSES IN AND STAKEHOLDERS THE CHANCELLOR ANNOUNCED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THAT THE SYSTEM HAD REVISED ITS GOALS AND LAUNCHED A NEW GRADUATION INITIATIVE TO NOW INCREASE FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES. 42% BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AT THAT TIME THE CSU IS OVERALL FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE STOOD AT 19% THE CSU IS ALSO MADE A SIGNIFICANT BREAK IN A POLICY THAT WASN'T WORKING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ELIMINATED NONCREDIT REMEDIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS WHICH WAS BLOCKING THE PATH OF STUDENT PROGRESS RATHER THAN AIDING AT. THAT PROGRAM WAS REPLACED BY CLASSES THE KERRY CREDIT AND INCLUDE EXTRA HOURS IN SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS WHO NEED THAT HELP WE OF COURSE HAD A SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING ON THAT SUBJECT A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AS WELL. IN A FEW MINUTES WE'LL HEAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FROM THEIR SYSTEM Y. PERSPECTIVE WITH DOCTOR JAMES MINOR I WILL ALSO HEAR FROM TWO OF THEIR TOP LEADERS FROM THE CAMP FROM A CAMPUS PERSPECTIVE DR EDUARDO WOULD SHOW UP PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY MONTEREY BAY. AND DR JOSE GOMEZ EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AT CAL STATE LA. AGAIN GOING BACK NOW TO A LITTLE BIT OF MORE OF HISTORY. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED AT MY CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM TO CREATE A FOR YOUR PATHWAY FOR LOW INCOME. FIRST GENERATION AND UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS- EIGHT PROVIDED A COMMITMENT AN OPTIONAL COMMITMENT FOR STUDENTS- EXCHANGE FOR. A DETERMINATION TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS THEY WERE GIVEN PRIORITY REGISTRATION- EXTRA DEVISING AND OTHER ASSISTANCE. IN THE THREE YEARS SINCE THAT PROGRAM'S EXISTENCE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX STUDENTS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO DATE THE LEGISLATURE IS ALLOCATED A HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE CSU GRADUATION INITIATIVE. WITH THIS CONTINUED THIS OF THE SUPPORT THE CSU IS ADDED COURSE SECTIONS AND FACULTY TO ENSURE STUDENTS CAN TAKE THE COURSES THEY NEED STEPPING UP ADVISING AND EARLY INTERVENTIONS AND INCREASING ACADEMIC FINANCIAL AND OTHER SUPPORT. OUR COLLABORATION. HAS LED TO A FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE FOR FIRST TIME FRESHMEN THAT NOW STANDS AT THIRTY ONE PERCENT. UP SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 19% IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. ABOUT HALFWAY TO THE SYSTEMS GOAL OF REACHING 40% BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. ENCOURAGING FACT THAT'S BEEN SHARED WITH ME RECENTLY IS THAT. 85% OF FIRST TIME FRESHMEN RETURNED THIS FALL FOR A SECOND YEAR. THAT'S A VERY ENCOURAGING SIGN AS WE LOOK AHEAD. AND OF COURSE MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE THAT THE OVERALL ENROLLMENT AT THE CSU IS NEARING FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND- WHICH IS AN ALL TIME HIGH. TO GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE CAMPUSES WITH THE MOST IMPROVED FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES. ARE BASED ON. NUMBERS THAT ARE ABOUT A YEAR OLD OUR HOPING TO GET NEW ONES BUT THE WHERE THERE'S BEEN THE MOST IMPROVEMENT HAVE BEEN A DOMINGUEZ HILLS SAN JOSE LONG BEACH SACRAMENTO AND CSU LOS ANGELES. BUT TO BE FAIR I MUST ALSO MENTION CAMPUSES WITH THE LEAST IMPROVE RATES OF THOSE INCLUDE RIGHT IN MY BACKYARD- CAL STATE EAST BAY. CHANNEL ISLANDS BAKERSFIELD FRESNO AND STANISLAUS SO THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE ONLY ABOUT THIRTEEN OF THE TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES HAVE A FOUR YEAR PLEDGE PROGRAM. AND TWENTY ONE CAMPUSES HAVE A TWO YEAR PLEDGE PROGRAM- IN ADDITION ONLY SAN JOSE STATE SACRAMENTO STATE AT CSU LONG BEACH HAVE ROBUST STUDENT ROMANS. IN THEIR CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. SO TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH MORE WE NEED TO DO AND TAKE A LOOK AT- WILL TAKE A LOOK AT STUDENT EXPECTATIONS WHEN THEY- FIRST ARRIVE ON CAMPUS ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE- WHICH WE WILL HEAR FROM THIS LATER THIS MORNING. NATIONALLY ALMOST 90% OF FRESHMAN EXPECT TO EARN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE WITHIN FOUR YEARS. NINETY PERCENT. WANT TO GET THROUGH IN% FOUR YEARS. HOWEVER AT THE CSU THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS COMMITTEE TO GRADUATING IN FOUR YEARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM AS LOW AS I AS I MENTIONED. EVEN THOUGH IT'S CLEAR THAT STUDENTS WANT TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM ZARA WHO RIDE THAT. THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION ON THIS ISSUE. WE KNOW THAT OUR CAMPUSES MUST DO BETTER TO OUR REGION PUBLICIZED THAT. THE PROGRAM TO ALLOW. SIX TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GRADUATING IN A TIMELY WAY. I WANT TO MAKE A JUST A COUPLE FINAL POINTS HERE BEFORE WE BEGIN THE TESTIMONIES. IF WE'RE TO MEET THE GOALS OF 40% OF FOUR YEAR GRADUATION BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE CLASS OF STUDENTS THAT ARE ARRIVING AT OUR INSTITUTIONS NEXT FALL IS OUR LAST CHANCE. TO MEET THAT THAT GOAL- THAT'S GOING TO BE THE COHORT THAT'S GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE HAVE REACHED OUR GOAL IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THAT CLASSES COMING IN LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS FROM TODAY. SO OUR ACTIONS IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS WILL DETERMINE WHETHER WE CAN HIT THAT 40% MARK. OF A 40% GRADUATION RATE IN FOUR YEARS. WELL FINALLY AT THE SAID THAT THAT THAT WHILE THE CSU HAS MADE STEADY PROGRESS IN THEIR GRADUATION RATES THE SYSTEM HAS ALSO MADE EFFORTS TO CLOSE THE EQUITY GAP. FOR HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES THOSE WHO IDENTIFY AS AFRICAN AMERICAN NATIVE AMERICAN OR LATINO. HOWEVER THAT GAP HAS BEEN VERY STUBBORN- THE FOUR YEAR GAP BETWEEN AFRICAN AMERICAN AND WHITE STUDENTS HAS GROWN FROM 12% TO TWENTY SIX PERCENT. AND THE WHITE LATINO GAP HAS GROWN FROM 9% TO TWENTY TWO PERCENT. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT THIS EQUITY GAP FROM OUR PANELISTS PARTICULARLY CHECK OBJECT JACKSON. FROM THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE. TODAY STUDENTS ARE ENGAGED IN MORE THAN EIGHTY THOUSAND VIRTUAL COURSES AND- HAD ACCESS TO ADVISEMENT HEALTH AND SUPPORT SERVICES AS SHIFTED ONLINE. AND WE KNOW UNDER KOVITZ- WITH HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT THAT THIS IS PUT A LOT OF GRADUATION PATHWAYS AT AT RISK. EARLIER THIS YEAR THE EDUCATION TRUST RELEASED A POLL THAT SHOWED THAT 75% OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS HAD CONCERNS ABOUT STAYING ON TRACK TO GRADUATE BECAUSE OF THE CORONAVIRUS. WE'RE TO HEAR MORE ON THIS SUBJECT FROM THREE HOT NIGHT HERE FROM THE SOURCE AN IMPACT. AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THAT RELATE TO WHY STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING THROUGH ONLINE CLASSES AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ALL THESE ISSUES THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. TO HEAR FROM EXPERTS TO HEAR FROM THE CSU. TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE STRATEGIES THAT THEY ARE PUTTING IN PLACE ON THE SYSTEM WIDE LEVEL ON THE CAMPUSES- TO DEAL WITH THAT. THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT WE ARE ALL FACING AND STUDENT CERTAINLY STUDENTS ARE FACING. BEFORE I INTRODUCE OUR FIRST WITNESS I WANT TO INVITE SENATOR ROB TO MAKE ANY REMARKS BEFORE WE BEGIN TO APPRECIATE HIS PARTNERSHIP ON THIS. SENATE ROTH THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ANY OPENING COMMENTS FROM YOU. COMMENTS BUT I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE THIS IS A VERY VERY. COURTNEIDGE YOU ARE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING WHAT ANALYSTS HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU SENATOR ROCK I'D LOVE AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE OUR FIRST WITNESS DR JAMES MINOR HE IS THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR. AND SENIOR STRATEGIST- WHO WILL PROVIDE A SYSTEM WIDE OVERVIEW OF THE CSU GRADUATION INITIATIVE- AND HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE BARRIERS CAMPUSES ARE FACING TO MEET THAT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOAL. DR MINOR IS A NATIONAL EXPERT IN EXPANDING ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND ADDRESSING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS- HE- PREVIOUSLY SERVED AT THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS HELD POSTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. DR MINOR ORIGINALLY CAME FROM DETROIT EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN SOCIOLOGY FROM JACKSON STATE UNIVERSITY. A MASTERS IN SOCIOLOGY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN AND A PHD IN EDUCATION POLICY ANALYSIS AND LEADERSHIP. FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON DR MINOR IT'S GREAT TO WELCOME YOU BACK TO OUR SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING AND WE WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING SENATOR HI IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE THIS MORNING- CENTER ROTH ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE YOU AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES. PROGRESS TOWARDS GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOALS DESPITE WHAT YOU DESCRIBED AS VERY CHALLENGING TIMES FOR US ALL. WHEN I LAST SPOKE BEFORE THIS- COMMITTEE. IT WAS IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR WE WERE INSTEAD OF SACRAMENTO HERE ROOM AND I BELIEVE SENATOR THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE EVEN BEEN SIX FEET APART. FROM EACH OTHER DURING THAT TESTIMONY. AFTER THE HEARING IN SACRAMENTO THE CSU TEAM DEBRIEFED I TOOK A FLIGHT BACK TO LONG BEACH AND WONDER WHICH RESTAURANT WOULD BE THE BEST CHOICE FOR DINNER. NEEDLESS TO SAY SO MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE- THAT THE CRIME CALIFORNIA WAS PROJECTING A SIX BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS. AND TODAY AGRONOMISTS THE BUDGET ANALYST ARE NOW TRYING TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE SIZE AND SCALE OF CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET DEFICIT IN THE BILLIONS. BACK IN FEBRUARY STATE SUPPORT FOR THE C. ISSUE WAS STRONG. R. AND THEN BY JUNE OUR SYSTEM SAW A FOUR POINT 2% REDUCTION WHICH EQUATED TO ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- THAT WERE REMOVED FROM OUR OPERATING BUDGET. IN BACK IN FEBRUARY THIS ISSUE ENROLLMENT AND GRADUATION RATES WERE AT OR NEAR ALL TIME HIGHS. NINE MONTHS LATER I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT EVEN AMIDST A PUNISHING PANDEMICS THE ISSUE A ROLE MANY GRADUATION NUMBERS CONTINUE TO BE STRONG WITH THE SPRING TWENTY TWENTY GRADUATION RATES. BEST NUMBER FOUR THAT'S THE ISSUE WHILE MANY INSTITUTIONS NATIONWIDE REPORTED A DECLINE IN UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT THE TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES COLLECTIVELY AND ROLLED THEIR LARGEST CLASS EVER IS YOU KNOW IT. FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND PLUS STUDENTS MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS CALL FOR. SO I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU JUST BRIEFLY A FEW HIGHLIGHTS- IN TERMS OF OUR PROGRESS ON THE GRADUATION. IGNATIEV QUICKLY FIVE GRADUATION. RATES BOB. FOUR YEAR RATE AS YOU NOTICED SENATOR NOW STANDS AT FORTY MORE ARE 31% THIS IS A TWELVE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE FROM WHEN WE BEGAN THIS IS THE HIGHEST RATE IN THE HISTORY FOR THE C. ISSUE WHEN THEY BUILD ON THE MOMENTUM THAT WE HAVE GAINED OVER THE YEARS AND REPRESENTS STEADY PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOAL OF FORTY PERCENT. ON ONE ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE C. ISSUE ALSO PRODUCED A HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY BACCALAUREATE DEGREES THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE IS NOW AT 62% WHICH IS ON PAR WITH THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR PUBLIC FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES. TWO YEAR TRANSFER RATE SOMETHING THAT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO US- PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WHO ARE GRADUATING TWO YEARS AFTER TRANSFERRING TO THE C. ISSUE NOW STANDS AT FORTY FOUR PERCENT. AGAIN THE HIGHEST EVER FOR THE C. ISSUE IN JUST ONE PERCENTAGE POINT AWAY. FROM OUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOAL. THE FOR YOUR TRAIN RATE OPERAR A STUDENTS WHO COME TO THE CSU OR GRADUATING- FOUR YEARS LATER IS NOW 79% ALSO THE HIGHEST EVER. AND AS YOU KNOW SENATOR BEFORE GRADUATION INITIATIVE THE CSU TRANSFER STUDENT COMPLETION RATES WERE ALREADY AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. COMPARED TO PEER INSTITUTIONS WITH CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN STRATEGIC FOCUS CAMPUSES HAVE ENHANCED THEIR SUPPORT OF TRANSFER STUDENTS FURTHER AUGMENTING THEIR SUCCESS. ANOTHER NOTABLE MILESTONE AS YOU MENTIONED- WHICH IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT GIVEN THE PANDEMIC IS A C. ISSUE POSTED ITS HIGHEST EVER RETENTION RATE AT EIGHTY FIVE AND A HALF PERCENT. FOR FIRST YEAR STUDENTS WERE RETURNING FOR THEIR SECOND TERM. WELL AS YOU KNOW AND YOU HAD MENTIONED- THE C. ISSUE IS ONLY ONE OF A HANDFUL OF INSTITUTIONS NATIONWIDE. THAT IS PUBLICLY DECLARED THE GOAL OF NOT CLOSING BUT ELIMINATING EQUITY GAPS. THAT WOULD CELEBRATE THE GAME THAT WE AVE MADE IN GRADUATION RATES WE ALSO NOW. THAT OUR SUCCESS IS NOT TRULY COMPLETE AND LOTS OF REPRESENTS SUCCESS FOR ALL STUDENTS INCLUDING OUR MOST VULNERABLE. WHAT THE SAME INTENSE FOCUS WE HAVE PLACED ON MOVING THE NEEDLE ON GRADUATION RATES WE MUST NOW RENEW OUR COMMITMENT TO ELIMINATING EQUITY GAPS THAT EXIST TODAY. THIS YEAR WE CAN REPORT THAT THE GAP IN GRADUATION RATES BETWEEN PELL ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AND THEIR PEERS IS NINE POINT 2% THE GAP CLOSED BY ONE PERCENTAGE POINT COMPARED TO LAST YEAR. FOR STUDENTS WHO IDENTIFY AS AFRICAN AMERICAN NATIVE AMERICAN OR LATIN ACTS WE ALSO SAW THE EQUITY GP NARAL BETWEEN THE STUDENTS AND THEIR PEERS FROM ELEVEN POINT ONE PERCENTAGE POINTS LAST YEAR TO TEN POINT FIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS THIS YEAR. THESE NUMBERS WALL ALTHOUGH INCREMENTAL REPRESENT FAR FOUGHT IMPROVEMENTS FROM LAST YEAR AND REFLECT OUR ONGOING COMMITMENT TO STUDENTS ARE TO ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS DRIVEN BY A BETTER AND MORE SOPHISTICATED DATA AN EQUITY DRIVEN POLICIES. WHAT IS THE ISSUE IS ACCOMPLISHED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AS RIGHTFULLY GAIN LOCAL AND NATIONAL ATTENTION IT IT IS TRULY EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE FOR SUCH A LARGE AND COMPLEX UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. HOWEVER WE ARE CLEAR THAT THERE IS MORE WORK YET TO BE DONE. WE'RE AT THE HALFWAY MARK AND SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WILL REQUIRE ONGOING PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE. IT WILL REQUIRE EVEN MORE INNOVATION ON OUR CAMPUSES AND THE KIND OF INSTITUTIONAL DEXTERITY DEMONSTRATED THIS PAST YEAR TO ENSURE THAT THE ISSUE STUDENTS CONTINUE. TO BE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE DEGREES. NOW I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN WE LAUNCH THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE- WE KNEW AT THE TIME THAT OUR PROGRESS BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WOULD NOT BE PERFECTLY LINEAR. HOWEVER I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT NO ONE WAS THINKING GLOBAL PANDEMIC IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WE'RE AT THE HALFWAY MARK. I DO WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW OF THE LARGE SCALE PROHIBITS THAT WE HAVE EXECUTED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS TO ENSURE THAT WE PRESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR STUDENTS. AS YOU MENTIONED IN TOTAL MORE THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND COURSES WERE TRANSITION TO VIRTUAL DELIVERY PRESERVING ACADEMIC CONTINUITY IN PROGRESS 2 DEGREES FOR MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. MORE THAN SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FACULTY MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND HOURS OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OVER THE SUMMER TO SUPPORT MORE EFFECTIVE VIRTUAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS FOR OUR STUDENTS. AND WITH AN AWARENESS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. OUR CSU CAMPUSES HAVE DISTRIBUTED MORE THAN TWENTY ONE THOUSAND NEW LAPTOPS AND TABLETS AND OFFER MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND BOB WIFI HOT SPOTS. AN INVESTMENT OF MORE THAN EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE THOUSANDS OF LAPTOPS AND TABLETS ALREADY. ON HAND AT OUR CAMPUSES THAT WERE MADE AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS. WITH THE ISSUE RANGE OF ACADEMIC AND SUPPORT SERVICES WERE ALSO CONVERTED TO VIRTUAL MODALITIES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO STUDENT ADVISING DISABILITY SERVICES SUPPLEMENTAL LEARNING SUPPORT FINANCIAL LATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND OUR BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVES AND ALSO ALL THE I. T. SUPPORT THAT WE'RE NOW PROVIDING TO STUDENTS IS DONE PRIMARILY VIRTUAL. ALL OF THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS SCAFFOLD ID THE PROGRESS FOR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. DIFFERENT WHAT IT UNDOUBTEDLY HAS BEEN A CHALLENGING EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR AND OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM MA'AM FOR THE NATION. SINCE THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE LARGE SCALE- THEY'RE EMBEDDED. IN THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND IT A FUNDAMENTALLY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO DO THINGS AT SCALE BUT ALSO THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCALIZED OF SOME OF THOSE EFFORTS. AND THE NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR VARIATIONS IN CALIFORNIA STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS. AND OUR CAMPUS NEEDS. WITH THAT SAME THERE SO AFFECTED PRACTICE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED ALMOST UNIVERSAL ADOPTION SO I WANT TO TALK AGAIN AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL CAMPUSES WHAT THE HAVE CUSTOMIZED THEIR EFFORTS BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING AT SCALE SYSTEM Y. ONE. I JUST WANT TO MENTION HERE THE BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE OUR SYSTEM WIDE EFFORT TO HOLISTICALLY ADDRESS STUDENTS WELL BEING BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM. FROM HOUSING AND FOOD AND SECURITY WE'RE NOW HAVE MONTH MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE COORDINATED EFFORTS TO PROVIDE. BASIC FOOD AND HOUSING SUPPORT FOR OUR STUDENTS WHICH NOW INCLUDE- DRIVE UP. IN SECURITY SUPPORT FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ACROSS OUR CAMPUSES YOU WILL HEAR MORE FROM OUR CAMPUS LEADERS ON THIS PANEL ABOUT THE INNOVATIVE ACADEMIC ADVISING- BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE INFERENCES THAT WE ARE PLACING ON PROVIDING STUDENTS BETTER INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE. AS THEY NAVIGATE THEIR COLLEGE CAREERS. AND THEN FINALLY- SENATOR I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE AND THE WORK WE HAVE YET TO DO ON THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT PROGRAM. SINCE THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN ACADEMIC YEAR ALMOST NINETEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM WHAT THE 24% INCREASE FROM LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR. WE SEE THIS IS ONE OF MANY EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS THAT THE C. ISSUE HAS THAT AT ITS DISPOSAL ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL EFFORTS TAILORED. TO SUIT LOCAL DEMOGRAPHIC IN CAMPUS NEEDS UNDER THE SIX OPERATIONAL PRIORITIES OUTLINED. IN THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. ALSO ONE OF JUST BRIEFLY AND- WITH THE CALLER FROM FROM- IMPORTANT TICKET WE HAVE SEEN AND THE AVERAGE STUDENT LOAD IN TERMS OF THE COURSE TAKING PATTERNS AND BEHAVIOR- WHICH HAS BEEN- COMPLEMENTED BY OUR ABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR COURSE OFFERING CAPACITY. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR SO MUCH OF A ABOUT- FOR MUCH OF WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT IMPROVING THE AVERAGE STUDENT UNIT LOW. IS OUR CAMPUS CAPACITY INABILITY TO DELIVER ADDITIONAL COURSE SECTIONS. FOR MY BROTHER TODAY IS NOT SEEKING TO GO INTO CAMPUS BASED PACIFIC TIME ON ALL OUR CAMPUS LEADERS TO DO THAT. I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE ARE MAKING TO ENSURE THAT EVERY STUDENT HAS THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT. NECESSARY TO OBTAIN A HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE DEGREE WE WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT LIE AHEAD AND TO ASK FOR THE ONGOING SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO MAINTAIN OUR UPWARD TRAJECTORY- IN PRODUCING C. ISSUE DEGREE HOLDERS. FOR SO MANY DEVELOPING CALIFORNIANS SENATOR I NOW WANT TO TURN THE PANEL OVER TO THE PRESIDENT OF CSU MONTEREY BAY EDUARDO OF CHIRLA TO PROVIDE A CAMPUS VIEW OF. OUR STUDENT SUCCESS EFFORTS. WITH THAT YOU DOUG MINOR- I DID HOWE SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS BUT I'M HAPPY GO AND HEAR FROM OUR CAMPUS LEADERS FIRST AND THAT THAT WE CAN START LOOPBACK. THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU BUT SO FIRST LET ME ADD TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT DR ED CHAU IT'S NICE TO SEE HIM AGAIN. HE HAS A RICH PERSONAL HISTORY GREW UP IN ARGENTINA BEFORE MOVING TO PORTLAND OREGON IN HIGH SCHOOL WENT ON TO EARN DEGREES IN PHYSICS. NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ECONOMICS TO RE COLLEGE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND THE NEW SCHOOL FOR SOCIAL. RESEARCH DR- CHOSE WORKED AS AN ENGINEER A FACULTY MEMBER- AN ACADEMIC ADMINISTRATOR HE WAS ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION- AND THEN HE OF COURSE IS SERVED AS PRESIDENT A CAL STATE UNIVERSITY MONTEREY BAY SINCE TWO THOUSAND. THIRTEEN SO IT'S A- IT'S A WONDERFUL PLEASURE TO WELCOME HIM BACK AND WE WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY NOW. THANK YOU CENTER GRAY'S. GLAZER AND- THANK YOU SIR ROBERT. THIS PRESENTATION AS WELL- I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME. INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CAMPUS. AND I DO HAVE A POWER POINT. THAT I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU. IN A SECOND BUT I DID WANT TO MAKE IT SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS BEFORE I BEGAN- CLEARLY AS AS- BUT OR MINOR MENTION- COOPER HAS A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE CSU AND- WE ARE REALLY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT- LED BY OUR CHANCE THROUGH OUR SYSTEM AND MADE AN EARLY DECISION TO GO VIRTUAL. FOLLOWING THE SCIENCE AND- EXERCISE NATIONAL NATIONAL LEADERSHIP IN DOING SO AND- EVIDENCE OF PRUDENCE- RIGHT NOW WE ARE NOW ALSO MAKING IT WITH MEN NEVER DECISION TO CONTINUE IN A VIRTUAL MODE- NOT ONLY IN THE FALL BUT IN THE SPRING I THINKTHAT WILL DOVETAIL NICELY WITH SOME POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE VACCINE FRONT THAT MORE I'M SURE WE'RE ALL AWARE OF. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS PANDEMIC IS- THAT IS AFFECTING THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY IS REALLY KIND OF UNPREDICTABLE- THERE WAS AN EXPECTATION- IN SACRAMENTO THAT- THIS WOULD LEAD TO A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT AND IN FACT IT APPEARS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE. A CONSERVATIVE LESS THAN THAT. S. RET TODAY THAT THE- THEIR DISSIPATING SICK. ONE TIME SURPLUS. OF FOR THIS THIS COMING YEAR BECAUSE REVENUES ARE COMING IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED. OF COURSE THAT WOULD BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME INVESTMENTS. IN THIS ISSUE AND GRADUATION INITIATIVE. BUT- IT HAS TO BE POINTED OUT THAT THE RECESSION HAS IMPACTED LOW INCOME. AND LOW SKILL WORKERS SO THE HARDEST- AND- THE BUT THE ECONOMY HAS NOT SUFFERED AS MUCH- PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE CREATIVE USE OF TECHNOLOGY LIKE WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW- AND THE FACT THAT MANY OF OUR- HIGH PAYING. SKILLED JOBS. CONTINUE TO BE- HI CAN COULD DO TO BE PERFORMED- WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY. CLEARLY THE ECONOMY WILL BE TRANSFORMED. ADAM BECAUSE THIS THIS PANDEMIC HAS ACCELERATED A LOT OF CHANGES THAT WERE FORESEEABLE IN TERMS OF THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN NEW WAYS OF DOING THINGS. WHAT'S CLEAR- THAT WILL BE THE CASE IN THE POST FUND DEMING FUTURE. IS THAT- FLEXIBLE SKILLS AND TECHNOLOGICAL LITERACY WILL BE PARAMOUNT- IN THE FUTURE AND THAT A COLLEGE EDUCATION WILL BE. EVEN MORE CRITICAL- TO MAINTAIN THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIES PRODUCTIVITY AND THE WELFARE OF OUR CITIZENS. SO I'M MAKE THOSE POINTS LET ME JUST- TURN NOW TO MY- POWERPOINT PRESENTATION HERE. SO I'M GONNA. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE HAS BEEN UNFOLDING AT OUR CAMPUS. IN A NUTSHELL THIS IS- THESE ARE THE RESULTS THE MOST CURRENT ONES- THE TARGETS SET OUT ON THE SECOND COLUMN AS YOU CAN SEE THERE FOR- FOR YOUR TRANSFER- AND- TO YOUR TRANSFER ETIENNE'S CAMPUS HAS BEEN- REALLY SUCCESSFUL AND- MEETING THOSE OR EXCEEDING THEM ALREADY- EVEN FIVE YEARS AWAY FROM THE DEADLINE OF GI TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- IT DOES SEEM THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING- THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN- EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS ON THE TRANSFER- TARGETS. OVERALL AND- THERE'S SOME REASONS FOR THAT THAT OLD LIEU TO LATER- ON THE- SIX YEAR- GRADUATION RATE FOR FIRST TIME FRESHMEN. WE'RE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS TOWARD OUR GOAL OF 63% AND THE FOUR YEAR- WERE A LITTLE BIT FARTHER AWAY- THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE BUT BUT ALSO- IT LOOKS- WE THAT WE ARE ON TRACK IF YOU ACTUALLY DO THE- QUALITY OF THESE- IT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. L. ADD AND THE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY EQUITY GAPS. ARE AN INTERESTING SITUATION THEY'RE NOT VERY LARGE- IT FLUCTUATED- OVER THE- FOUR YEARS WITH NO CLEAR TREND. ON AVERAGE THE PELLEGRI YEP IT'S BEEN ABOUT ONE PERCENT- WITH OUR GOAL IS OF COURSE TO ELIMINATED AND THEIR- UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY EQUITY GAP. CURRENTLY STANDS AT- HALF A PERCENT. IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION SO RIGHT NOW ARE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS ARE PERFORMING SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE- POPULATION AT LARGE BUT OF COURSE THAT'S PROBABLY NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AS AS A VERY SMALL DIFFERENCE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE OBSERVED IS THAT- SYSTEM BE USED TO HAVE- NO GAPS WHATSOEVER- WHEN WE STARTED IN THE DOWN THIS ROAD OF THE G. I.'S TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THAT WAS A GOOD NEWS THAT THE BAD NEWS WAS THAT THE REASON WAS THAT THE VIRUS FROM RACE WERE NOT TERRIBLY GOOD FOR ANYBODY. AND SO AS WE'VE MADE GOOD PROGRESS- ON THESE- GRADUATION RATES- THE- THOSE RATES HAVE ALSO INCREASED- INCREASE FOR PL AND YOU ARE AND STUDENTS- BUT IN THE CASE OF FELT SON OF A GAP STARTED TO EMERGE- SO THAT THE IMPROVEMENT OVERALL WAS A LITTLE BIT LARGER THAN THE IMPROVEMENT WITHIN. THE PAL STUDENT POPULATION FOR THAT SO THEY THEY GAP STARTED TO EMERGE IS NOT VERY LARGE DOESN'T CLEAR TREND BUT IT IS THERE AND WHAT IS SUGGESTED TO US IS THAT WE MAY NEED TO- HAVING PICKED THE LOW HANGING FRUIT FOR THE POPULATION OF STUDENTS AT LARGE. WE MAY NEED SOME TARGETED- SO- CAL STUDENTS AND FOR UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES. HI THIS IS HOW WE ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS UNNATURAL- THE OVERSIGHT IS FOR ADVISING COMMANDERS MINIATURIZATION OUR- DEAL TURNS WE DEVELOPED TO REMEDIATION RESPONSE TO AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ELEVEN TEN- THE AUTO MODEL WHICH IS OUR- RESPONSE TO EXECUTIVE ORDER ELEVEN HUNDRED CALLING FOR A REVAMPING OF GENERAL EDUCATION. A SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION SOME ADMINISTRATIVE TWEAKS IN OUR PROCEDURES- RENEWED FOCUS ON TRANSFER STUDENTS ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO BASIC NEEDS AND- FOCUSING ON INCREASED STUDENT ENGAGEMENT THAT'S THE OVER HERE LET ME GO THROUGH THESE POINTS ON A LITTLE MORE DETAIL. ADVISING WHAT WE'VE DONE THERE IS WE HAVE CENTRALIZED- THE ADVISORS AND CONNECTED THEM TO THE CAREER SERVICES CENTER- AND REALLY MADE IT MORE OF A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADVISING STUDENTS SO THEY'RE CLEAR ON THEIR PATHWAYS. WE'VE ALSO INCREASE THE OVERALL NUMBER OF ADVISORS. THERE IS AN EARLY ALERT TEAM AND THAT- DOES OUTREACH TO AT RISK STUDENTS THEN THAT'S A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF FACULTY ADVISORS TUTORS. AND STUDENT FARES- PROFESSIONALS THAT- SPOT- YOU KNOW EMERGING PROBLEMS WITH STUDENTS AND- AND INTERVENE. I WE- APPROACH A HUNDRED NICE IN FALL TWENTY UNDER THIS PROGRAM. MANDATORY ORIENTATION WE- THIS HAS LED TO WE NOW REQUIRE EVERY STUDENTS COMING. I DON'T TEND ORANGE ASIAN AND THAT HAS REALLY LED TO- IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES- THE OVERALL ENROLLMENT RATE HAS INCREASED- FOR STUDENTS AS WELL AS FOR- UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS- THE STUDENTS WHO DO ATTEND MANAGER EDITION ARE SHOWING HIGHER PARTICIPATION IN CO CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES- IN ACADEMIC ADVISING. AND IN FIRST SECOND TERM RETENTION. AS WELL AS IN MAINTENANCE OF GOOD ACADEMIC STANDING SO THESE ARE ALL MEASURABLE OUTCOMES- THAT SHOW IMPROVEMENT AS A RESULT THIS MANCHURIAN TATIAN- EXECUTIVE ORDER ELEVEN TEN- THE WAY WE RESPONDED TO THAT OUR CAMPUSES WE DEVELOPED A STRAIGHT STRETCH CORE STRATEGY FOR ENGLISH- REMEDIATION- THE TWO SEMESTER COURSE FOR WRITTEN COMMUNICATION WAS DEVELOPED BY DOCTOR GRAPH- EVEN BEFORE YOUR ELEVEN HUNDRED ELEVEN TEN CAME INTO PLAY BUT ONCE IT DID WE- EXTENDED- THE COVERAGE OF THAT COURSE TO STUDENTS THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE. A TAKEN A REMEDIAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL COURSES AND THE OUTCOMES HAVE BEEN REALLY QUITE POSITIVE- WHEN INITIALLY IS- INTRODUCED THIS COURSE REDUCED- D. D. W. OR F. GRADES OF STUDENTS FROM THIRTEEN POINT THREE OF SIX POINT SEVEN AND AFTER WE EXPANDED THE COVERAGEOF THIS COURSE TO STUDENTS WHO WOULD HAVE NORMALLY BEEN GOING THROUGH DEVELOPMENTAL COURSES- THIS PROPORTION REMAINED AT SIX POINT 7% FOR THE STUDENTS THAT WE ADDED THAT WOULD HAVE% NORMALLY TAKEN DRAMA COURSES WERE JUST AS SUCCESSFUL- WITH THIS NEW STRETCH COURSE APPROACH AS- POPULATION. OF STUDENTS OF LARGE. AUG FOR MATH THE APPROACH HAS BEEN TO DO CORE. SUPPORT OF TO AND ASSISTANCE. AND THE COURSES HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO THREE UNITS TO MATCH THE NEW REQUIREMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTED WITH SUPPORT SERVICES IN THE PAST RATES HAVE IMPROVED. HE GOT TO SPEND REDUCE. YOUR LIVING HUNDREDS CALLING FOR THE REVAMP OF- GENERAL EDUCATION- RESPONSE WAS THE AUTHOR MODEL. WHICH ALLOWED FOR EASIER TRANSFER FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES BETTER ARTICULATION OF THOSE GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES- AND DECREASE TIME GRADUATION. IT SUPPLEMENTAL EXTRA INSTRUCTION WE FOCUS ON STEM COURSES. WE RECEIVED- A AYE NATURE'S AYE GRANT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT SUPPORTS THIRTY FIVE TUTORS AND THREE INSTRUCTIONAL ASSISTANCE AND THIS HAS LED TO IMPROVE PASS RATES IN THE SCHOOL. AND REDUCE EQUITY GAPS IN NOW GATEWAY COURSES IN CHEMISTRY. SOME ADMINISTRATIVE TWEAKS THAT WE'VE DONE- WE HAVE INSTITUTED WALKING ROMAN FORSTA AND SEVERAL STUDENTS SUPPORT PROGRAM SO STUDENTS THAT TAKE. UP PROGRAM THE PARTICIPATING CAMPUS WILL- NSCS AND THREE WHICH IS A COMPUTER SCIENCE- IN THREE PROGRAM AIMED AT THE- US STUDENTS FROM THE- UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN SALINAS VALLEY. AND THE LIVING LEARNING COMMUNITIES THAT WE ESTABLISH FOR OUR STUDENTS- THESE ALL NOW ARE- HANDLE THROUGH WALKING TO- THE- THAT AND THAT LEADS TO IMPROVED OUTCOMES WELL- WE- WE DO- MORE PRO ACTIVE I REACH ON HOLES WHEN STUDENTS ARE PLACED ON A REGISTRATION HOLD BECAUSE- THEY HAVE TOO MANY- CREDITS THEIR SUPERCENTERS OR WHETHER THEY ARE- I'M MISSING AN IMMUNIZATION OR THEIR OWN OPERATION. WOULD PUT THEM ON HOLD WE REQUIRE THEM TO COME IN AND GET ADVISING AND THAT HELPS ALSO- KEEP GOOD TIMELY PASSED TO GRADUATION- AND FOR- STUDENTS THAT- THAT HAVE- STOPPED OUT AND ARE CLOSE TO GRADUATING WE HAVE DONE SOME- PROACTIVE I REACH THEM AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO ENROLL AND FINISH THEIR DEGREE HOW AND SO THAT ALSO HAS LED TO SOME. SOME IMPROVEMENTS. THE TRANSFER STUDENTS SAID I THINK THAT AND THIS IS WHERE I WENT OVER HARPER- CIRCLE BACK TO THE EARLY RESERVATION THAT WE SEEM TO HAVE EXCEEDED THE TARGETS FOR THEM- GRADUATION INITIATIVE ON TRANSFER GRADUATION RATES AND THAT THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL IN THIS ISSUE AND I THINK. A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH SOME OF THESE FACTORS THE FACT THAT- THE SUBSIDY REFER TRANSFER I THINK IS REALLY- HELPED. A FOCUS ON- AND REALLY- MAKING SURE THAT OUR ARTICULATION AND TRANSFER CREDIT RULES WITH OUR- FEEDER COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE ARE OURS ARE SEAMLESS. THE USE OF THE OASIS DEGREE AUDIT AND DEGREE PLANNER TOOLS FOR STUDENTS- THOSE ARE REALLY HELPFUL. WE HAVE A TRANSFER ST NOW THAT HAS A FULL TIME COORDINATOR AND TRY PEER MENTORS ASSIST TRANSFER STUDENTS. WE HAVE A WELCOME DAY JUST FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS- AND THE- TRANSFER ORIENTATION REALLY- IS EXTENDED NOW TO FIFTEEN WEEKS IN THE FALL AND SIX IN THE SPRING. AND THEN THE PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE HAVE A DEAL OF SOME CAREER PATHWAYS AGREEMENTS WITH OUR FUTURE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN OUR AREA. AND THAT HAS ALSO. I THINK LEAD TO IMPROVED OUTCOMES AND THAT I GREATER RATE OF TRANSFER FROM. OUR FEEDER SCHOOLS HELPING THEM ALSO BUT SHE ONE OF THEIR OBJECTIVES WHICH IS THAT STUDENTS WHO ENROLL IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH THE INTENTION OF TRANSFERRING SHOULD GO AHEAD AND DO SO AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THEY HAVE IN THE PAST. IN THE BASIC NEEDS- WE HAVE- HELP STUDENTS WITH EMERGENCY HOUSING NEEDS WITH FOOD SECURITY. WITH UNEXPECTED EXPENSES AND CHILD CARE WE HAVE A- FULL TIME CARE MANAGER AND BASIC NEEDS COORDINATOR. WE RECEIVED A GRANT FROM A. T. AND T. FOR GROCERY CARDS FOR STUDENTS WITH FOOD SECURITY. WE HAVE A SMALL GRANT PROGRAM FOR UNEXPECTED EXPENSES FOR STUDENTS- AND THE CALFRESH IS ANOTHER GRANT PROGRAM THAT. HELPS STUDENTS FOR WITHOUT FOOD SECURITY. IT'S AN INCREASE TO ENGAGE- WE- AND SPRING BREAK LEADERSHIP PROGRAM- TO KEEP STUDENTS ENGAGED WE HAVE- I YOUNG MEN OF COLOR AND MEN OF COLOR LINES PROGRAM TO. AND MAKE THE- PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS WHO ARE A SMALL GROUP WITHIN OUR CAMPUS- MANY OF THEM COMING FROM- COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE. HIGHLY SEGREGATED AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED BEING ASMALL MINORITY AND A AND A LARGE CAMPUS HELPING THEM STAY CONNECTED I'M FEELING GAUGE WITH THE CAMPUS OF THE BLACK STUDENT SUCCESS CENTER IS ALSO HELPING WITH THAT. AND WE HAVE THE AUTO CROSS CULTURAL CENTER WHICH IS- ETCETERA THAT- REALLY- IT HELPS STUDENTS EXPAND THEIR HORIZONS AS WELL IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE STUDENTS FEEL THAT THEY'RE PART OF A COMMUNITY OF- OF SIMILAR US. AS STUDENTS WITH SIMILAR YOU KNOW WITH SAME IDENTITY BUT ALSO REACH OUT AND CONNECT WITH OTHERS- THAT'S ALSO PART OF THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE. AND THE- Q. UNDER HIS SUCCESS CENTER IS THIS- ARE THE CENTER THAT HELPS US TO UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS- WITH THEIR UNIQUE CHALLENGES SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE- MEASURES AND TACTICS THAT WE'VE WE'VE USED TO ACHIEVE THE RESULTS THAT WE HAVE. AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES- IN IN. REAL LIFE- SUCH LIKE THIS IS THE IS NOT A- LIKE- HEY THIS IS NOT A DOUBLE BLIND- CONTROL- EXPERIMENT- THIS IS MORE LIKE AN ENGINEERING LAB DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WHERE YOU JUST KEEP TRYING THINGS TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE. AND WHEN YOU TRY MULTIPLE THINGS IN THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE IMPROVES. IT'S VERY TOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE OF THESE THINGS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HOW MUCH OF THE IMPROVEMENT. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT- AS A WHOLE THE THIS CLUSTER OF- TACTICS HAS LED TO- THE RESULTS THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVE OF WHICH WERE. VERY WHAT THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION AND CENTER LASER THAT THANK YOU PRESIDENTIAL- AND THAT IS A GREAT TOOL BOX OF- OF USEFUL THINGS THAT YOU WERE DOING ON THE CAMPUS IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE- TO SEE. I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM OUR FRIENDS AT CAL STATE LA IN JUST A MOMENT BUT CAN I JUST ASK ONE QUESTION FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST IN THAT SET. WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON THE CAMPUS TO MAKE STUDENTS AWARE OF THE FOR YOUR PATH PROGRAM THAT WOULD GIVE THEM PRIORITY REGISTRATION AND GET THEM. TO COMMIT TO TRYING TO ACHIEVE THAT FOUR YEAR GRADUATION WHAT WHAT WHAT YOU DO TO PUBLICIZE THAT ON YOUR CAMPUS. WELL THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS- SHARE WITH STUDENTS AS PART OF THE OVERALL ADVISING AND ORIENTATION PROGRAMS. AND I CAN REPORT THAT- LAST YEAR. WE HAD NINETY SIX STUDENTS IN THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE AND ALL OF THEM I GRADUATED. WITHIN TWO YEARS- AND CURRENTLY WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE NEW AND CONTINUING STUDENTS THIS YEAR THAT ARE PARTICIPATING. IT'S GREAT TO HEAR AND- I DO NOTICES WE TRAVEL AROUND TO DIFFERENT CAMPUSES AND TALK TO STUDENT LEADERS- THAT IN SOME CAMPUSES THEY'RE JUST NOT EVEN AWARE OF THAT PATHWAY AND THAT THE OPPORTUNITIES IT PROVIDES TO THEM AND I APPRECIATE. HEARING ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON YOUR CAMPUS WELL LET ME TURN NOW TO INTRODUCE DR JOSE GOMEZ. HE IS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LOS ANGELES I KNOW A KEY PARTNER WITH PRESIDENT COVINO- IN THEIR EFFORT TO AND ACHIEVE STUDENT SUCCESS- WHICH SAID DR GOMEZ HAS BEEN A LEADER ON. BEFORE YOU CAME TO CAL STATE LOS ANGELES IN TWO THOUSAND NINE HE HELD SENIOR POSITIONS- IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE. I SERVED AS THE CHIEF HIGHER EDUCATION ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. DR GOMEZ GOT HIS BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN SOCIOLOGY FROM CAL POLY POMONA. A MASTER'S DEGREE IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND HIS PHD IN POLITICAL SCIENCE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WE WELCOME- DOCTOR GOMEZ TO OUR COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING SENATOR GLAZER AND SENATOR ROSS. THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUES VICE CHANCELLOR MINOR AND PRESIDENT- CHAU A TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT STUDENT SUCCESS. THIS TEAM IS CENTRAL TO THE WORK OF THE CSU AND CAL STATE LA IT IS OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE THAT SHAPES OUR DECISION MAKING OUR PLANS AND OUR WORK ON BEHALF OF OUR STUDENTS. CASTELLI IS A FEDERALLY DESIGNATED HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION. WITH A STUDENT POPULATION OF MORE THAN TWENTY SIX THOUSAND. APPROXIMATELY 58% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND 63% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE PELL GRANT ELIGIBLE. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF PELL GRANT ELIGIBLE STUDENTS IN THE CSU YET WE ARE RANKED NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION FOR THE UPWARD MOBILITY OF OUR STUDENTS. THIS PAST YEAR WE GRADUATED NEARLY SEVENTY THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THE HISTORY OF CAL STATE LA. THE LIVES OF THESE GRADUATES ARE FOREVER CHANGED BY THE EDUCATION THEY RECEIVED WE WANT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS TO REAP THE REWARDS OF A UNIVERSITY DEGREE. TO EXPERIENCE UPWARD MOBILITY AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO AND BECOME LEADERS IN CALIFORNIA. CAL STATE LA WE FOCUSED ON THE CSU'S GI TWENTY TWENTY FIVE INITIATIVE. THE CSU'S FLAGSHIP EFFORT TO INCREASE GRADUATION RATES ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS IN DEGREE COMPLETION AND MEET CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE NEEDS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE CALLS ARE CONNECTED IF WE ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS WE ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA. THE CSU GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SETS DISTINCT TARGETS FOR EACH CSU CAMPUS. BASED ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES. THE CSU HAS RECOGNIZED THE CAST IT AWAY IS MAKING GOOD PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR GOAL TOWARDS ITS GOALS. OUR FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE FOR FIRST TIME STUDENTS AND 17% IT IS CLIMB FROM 6% AND WE EXPECT OUR RATE TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE. WE SAW GREATER SUCCESS WITH OUR SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE FOR FIRST TIME STUDENTS ARE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE TARGET FOR FRESHMAN IS FIFTY FIVE PERCENT. WE ARE STEADILY APPROACHING THAT RISING FROM 36% TO FIFTY TWO POINT 5% THIS YEAR. TWO YEAR GRADUATE THE TWO YEAR GRADUATION RATE TARGET FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS IS THIRTY SIX PERCENT. WE HAVE ALREADY SURPASSED THAT RISING FROM SIXTEEN PERCENT. LAST YEAR OUR GRADUATION RATE WAS THIRTY EIGHT POINT 3% OUR FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS IS NOW SEVENTY SIX POINT 6% OUR GOAL IS EIGHTY ONE PERCENT. THE PROGRESS WE'VE EXPERIENCED AS A RESULT OF DETERMINATION HARD WORK AND A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. THE COMPLETION OF THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENTS IN THE FIRST YEAR IS A KEY INDICATOR OF STUDENT RETENTION AND GRADUATION. A KEY COMPONENT OF GI TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WAS A DECISION BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO ELIMINATE REMEDIATION THROUGHOUT THE CSU AND TO FOCUS INSTEAD ON ACADEMIC PREPARATION. THE NUMBER OF OUR STUDENTS WHO COMPLETED GED MATH AND FULFILL THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENT IN THEIR FIRST YEAR SHOT UP FROM 49% IN. 2016284% AND TWENTY NINETEEN. A DECISION BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OPEN THE DOOR FOR US TO TRY A NEW APPROACH. OUR FACULTY OVERHAULED THE MATH CURRICULUM AND DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A NEW PLAN. WE CREATED NEW COURSES THAT WERE MADE MORE STUDENT CENTERED. MULTI SECTION COURSES HAVE COORDINATORS AND STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO JUST IN TIME SUPPORT ACADEMIC COACHES ASSIST STUDENTS WITH TOPICS BEYOND THE SUBJECT MATERIAL SUCH AS TIME MANAGEMENT PLANNING AND GOAL SETTING ACCESS TO UNIVERSITY RESOURCES AND STUDY TIPS. I NEARLY WARNING SYSTEM BASED ON ATTENDANCE ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATION DATA ALLOWS OUR INSTRUCTORS TO INTERVENE IN REAL TIME. WE ALSO INVESTED IN OUR MATH FACULTY NEARLY SIXTY OF OUR FACULTY RECEIVED EXTENSIVE SUPPORT FROM OUR NATIONALLY ACCLAIMED CENTER FOR EFFECTIVE TEACHING AND LEARNING. WE ARE PROUD OF OUR SUCCESS IN CLOSING THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING REQUIREMENT COMPLETION GAP BETWEEN ARE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS AND NON UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS AS YOU CANSEE WE HAD A GAP OF SIXTEEN PERCENTAGE POINTS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE HAVE NARROWED THAT TO JUST SIX PERCENTAGE POINTS. CAL STATE LA IS NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION FOR EXCEEDING PREDICTED GRADUATION RATES ACCORDING TO US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. BASED ON THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR STUDENTS AND CAMPUS OUR GRADUATION RATE WAS PROJECTED TO BE TWENTY THREE PERCENT. OUR ACTUAL GRADUATION RATE WAS FIFTY TWO PERCENT. OVER PERFORMANCE OF TWENTY NINE PERCENTAGE POINTS MAKING CASTED A LATE THE TOP IN THE NATION AMONG PUBLIC AMONG PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. I'M HAPPY TO POINT OUT THAT OTHER CSU'S ARE ALSO TOP PERFORMERS IN FACT NINE OF THE TOP FIFTEEN TOP PERFORMERS ARE CSU'S. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. LAST YEAR THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY NAMED CAL STATE LA A CHAMPION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION FOR LEADING THE WAY FOR CREATING PATHWAYS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO OUR UNIVERSITY THROUGH A SOCIO DEGREES FOR TRANSFER. THE MAJORITY OF CASTELLI MAJORS ARE ALIGNED WITH ASSOCIATE DEGREES FOR TRANSFER AND FACULTY CONTINUE TO WORK ON A LINE EVEN MORE MAJORS WITH SIMILAR EIGHTY TEASE. THIS IS ANOTHER TOOL WE USE TO SUPPORT TRANSFER STUDENTS ON THEIR PATH TO GRADUATION. IN ADDITION WE ARE USING OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS. WITH SB FOUR TWELVE WAS ENACTED WE SAW HOW FAR WE HAD TO GO BEFORE WE CAN DELIVER ON THIS PROMISE TO OUR STUDENTS. TODAY THANKS TO FINDING SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND CSU SYSTEM WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY WE'RE PROUD TO SAY WE WANT START CALIFORNIAPROMISE PROGRAM THIS FALL IT IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT MEANS OF PROMOTING AND SUPPORTING GRADUATION IN FOUR YEARS. FOR FIRST YEAR STUDENTS AND TWO YEARS FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY MARKETING THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE TO OUR STUDENTS THE PROGRAM IS FEATURED PROMINENTLY ON OUR HOME PAGE AND IS FEATURED ON AN EASY TO NAVIGATE WEBSITE. WE'RE EXCITED TO OFFER INDIVIDUAL SUPPORT TO OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE DEDICATED TO GRADUATING IN FOUR OR TWO YEARS. THE PANDEMIC THREAT AND OUR STUDENTS TO GRADUATION. MANY OF OUR STUDENTS COME FROM THE MOST UNDER RESOURCE AREAS IN OUR STATE. THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE BEEN HARD HIT BY THE PANDEMIC. TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR STUDIES IN SPITE OF THE PANDEMIC WE TOOK SEVERAL MEASURES WE PURCHASED THOUSANDS OF LAPTOPS IN HOT SPOTS WE KNOW THAT OUR STUDENTS NEED THIS HELP. WE DISTRIBUTED THIS TECHNOLOGY THROUGH A CONTACT FREE PROCESS. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FACING OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES DURING THE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS STUDENT SECURITY. WE UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS WITH BASIC NEEDS WE HAVE AN ONGOING FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM THROUGH OUR CHIEF L. A. PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM WITH THE YMCA. WE HAVE ALSO COLLABORATED WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND THE LOS ANGELES REGIONAL FOOD BANK TO ASSIST OUR STUDENTS THEIR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND MEET WE HAVE DISTRIBUTED MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND TWELVE TONS OF PRODUCE DAIRY DRY GOODS AND MEET TO NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND FANS. CASTED ELISCU PANTRY LOCATED ON CAMPUS PROVIDES ASSISTANCE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO OUR STUDENTS. WHEN WE HOST THE KOBE NINETEEN TESTING SITE ON CAMPUS FOR OUR CAMPUS AND ROSENIOR MY COMMUNITIES TO STAY HEALTHY WE'RE ALSO OFFERING A FREE DRIVE THRU FLU VACCINATION CLINIC TOMORROW DURING THIS EVENT TO CAL STATE LA WE WILL ALSO DISTRIBUTE GROCERIES AND DENTAL CARE KITS TO OUR STUDENTS AND OUR COMMUNITY. IN THE SPRING WE DISBURSING NEARLY EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN SHARES ACT FUNDING TO ALMOST TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. FOUR WE RECEIVED KERR'S ACTS FUNDING WE USED UNIVERSITY FUNDS TO ASSIST STUDENTS WITH EMERGENCY GRANTS TOTALLING ALMOST THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. SOME OF OUR STUDENTS WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CARERS ACT FUNDING SO WE PROVIDED NEARLY A MILLION DOLLARS TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR STATUS RECEIVE THE HELP THEY NEED. OUR FACULTY AND STAFF ARE CRUCIAL TO OUR STUDENTS SUCCESS AND TO ALL OF OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO TRY TO THRIVE DURING THE PANDEMIC. OUR FACULTY SPENT MUCH OF THE SUMMER PREPARING TO TEACH IN WAYS THAT CHALLENGE PREPARE AND ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS IN A VIRTUAL SPACE. NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND FACULTY COMPLETED THE CENTER FOR EFFECTIVE TEACHING AND LEARNING ALL INSTRUCTIONS CERTIFICATE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDED GREATER TOOLS FOR TEACHING IN A VIRTUAL SPACE. OUR STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM A STELLAR FACULTY WE CONTINUE TO HIRE TENURE TRACK FACULTY TO MEET OUR INSTRUCTION IN FALL TWENTY TWENTY WE WELCOME FIFTY FIVE NEW TENURE TRACK FACULTY. OUR SUCCESS IS AN OUTCOME OF THE DEEP DEDICATION OF OUR FACULTY AND STAFF TO REQUIRED AWAY WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO REMOVE BARRIERS AND TO WORK CREATIVELY TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. BUT VIDEO THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE NOW SHOWS SOME OF THE KEY STEPS WE TOOK ON BEHALF OF OUR STUDENTS IN RESPONSE TO THE CODE NINETEEN ACADEMIC. STAYED AWAY WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD ON G. I. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THESE ARE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES INSTRUCTED OUR TRADITIONAL WAYS OF WORKING. WE HAVE TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATES AND A REDUCTION IN EQUITY. WE'RE PLANNING TO TAKE A WORK TO THE NEXT LEVEL BY BUILDING A NEW CENTER FOR ACADEMIC SUCCESS. IT WOULD BE A ONE STOP SHOP WHERE STUDENTS CAN GET PERSONALIZED ATTENTION AND BE REFERRED TO SOMEONE WHO CAN IMMEDIATELY HELP. EITHER YOU'RE AN ACADEMIC COACH FRIEDMAN A FACULTY MEMBER OFFICE. IN THE PANDEMIC CARE AND EVERYTHING. WE WERE SUDDENLY CAN WITH A ON PRESS CHALLENGE BEING SCATTERED ACROSS LOS ANGELES AND MANY OF US WHICH LIMITED ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY IN DOWN. WE WERE WORRIED THAT OUR STUDENTS WILL BE UNABLE TO CONNECT WITH THE VISORS SO WE PURCHASED THOUSANDS OF LAPTOPS AND HOT SPOT. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT STUDENTS TO ESTABLISH MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS WITH AT LEAST ONE PERSON ON CAMPUS ARE MORE LIKELY TO REMAIN IN COLLEGE. SO DURING THE PANDEMIC RELATIONSHIPS BECAME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. WE REALIZE THAT WE NEEDED TO REIMAGINE ADVISING AND STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES REMOVE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS AND USE OUR TECHNOLOGY TO REWIRE THE WAY WE WORK TOOK PLACE RELATED TRANSHIPPED FRONT AND CENTER. WE ACCELERATED OUR SHIFT TO PROACTIVE ADVISING. WITHIN TWO WEEKS ALL OF OUR ADVISORS ACADEMIC COACHES TUTORS AND PEER LED STUDY GROUP SEGMENT DESIGNS. WE FOCUSED ON HELPING OUR STUDENTS BILD RELATIONSHIPS. AND STAY CONNECTED. MAYBE CAME INTENSE ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY. WE SINCE IN FOLLOWED UP WITH ADDITIONAL PHONE CALLS AND MOST RECENTLY TAX MESSAGE. WE NEED EASIER FOR TO SET UP APPOINTMENTS WITH OUR EBAY ADVISED SYSTEM. AND FOR THE FOR TIME EVERY FOR YEARS. WILL HAVE THEIR OWN MISER. AT THE END OF SPRING TO ARE TO A WERE TRUMP HIGHER THEY WERE THE SAME TIME YEAR AND I CAN. OR UP. FOR FIFTY. THIS SUMMER WE MOVED. ON ANY. DIVISORS TO ON OR- AND CONNECT LIKE BEFORE. EVERY STILL OUT OF GROUP BY SAYS BEFORE THE REGS FOR. WE INVITED ALL STUDENTS TO REMOTE LEARNING EXPERIENCE IN CAMPUS. THEY LEARN HOW TO SUBMIT ASSIGNMENTS AND HOW TO PREPARE FOR CLASS. IN THE NET OTHER FIRST YEAR STUDENTS. WE CONTINUE TO BRIDGE DEVISING WITH ACADEMIC SUPPORT. WORST WERE UNABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR SERVICES BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING OR TAKING CARE OF CHILDREN SIBLINGS AT HOME. WE REALIZE THAT WE NEEDED TO MEET OUR STUDENTS WHERE THEY WERE AT. WE PROVIDED EVENING AND WEEKENDS. DURING A COACHING SESSIONS. AND WE ALSO PROVIDED ONLINE WEBINARS ON TOPICS RELATED TO STUDENT SUCCESS WE ARE REACHING MORE STUDENTS. AND BECOMING MORE PERSONAL AT THE SAME. OUR STUDENTS BENEFITED FROM THE CHANGES THAT WE IMPLEMENT THAT STUDENTS MAY NOT BE ON CAMPUS BUT THEY ARE BACK IN CLASS OUR FIRST YEAR RETENTION RATES ARE HIGHER THIS YEAR THAN LAST OUR GRADUATION RATES HAVE CONTINUED TO CLIMB. AND WE REDUCED OUR AT THE- DESPITE BEING. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS AND SENATOR ROSS FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE CSU IN THE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WORK WITH YOU TO SUPPORT STUDENT SUCCESS THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU TO A DOCTOR GOMEZ- FOR YOUR A GREAT PRESENTATION AND- SOME REALLY WONDERFUL PROGRESS POINTS THAT YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED THE DATE THAT YOU PROVIDED ON MATH COMPLETION IS INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE AND IMPORTANT- THAT THE- TOUCHES THE ENHANCED ADVISING- TRYING TO CREATE THOSE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN STUDENTS THEMSELVES AS WELL AS TO THE CAMPUS. COMMUNITY ARE SO IMPORTANT AND- SO IMPACTFUL AND IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY GREAT TO HEAR AND THE CITY ME TALKED ABOUT BEGINNING YOUR CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM THIS YEAR TO HAVE THAT A NUMBER FOR HOW MANY HAVE. JOINED THAT PROGRAM. WE I THINK WE'VE GOT A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED. THAT HAVE- US SIGNED UP FOR HIM- EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN THE PROGRAM WE'RE STARTING IT. AND IN FACT IN THE SPRING AS WELL. BUT I THINK THAT AGAIN WHAT WE HEAR FROM STUDENTS ALL THE TIME IS THAT- THEY WANT TO GET THROUGH- THEY KNOW THE CHALLENGES THEY WANT THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET THE CLASSES THEY NEED TO GET THROUGH- AND SO KNOWING ABOUT THAT FOUR YEAR PATHWAY AND A COMMITMENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY TO ENSURE THAT THEY WILL GET THE CLASSES. AND GIVEN THAT ENHANCE TO HELP OF FOR UP FOR EARLY REGISTRATION- AND ADVISING ANNA IS A BIG INCENTIVE TO THEM AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO PUBLICIZE THE PROGRAM ON YOUR CAMPUS BY STAFF HAS SENT ME A NOTE THAT SAYS IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE OR SIX CLICKS TO FIND THE PROGRAM ON YOUR WEBSITE SO IT'S NOT SO EASY TO SEE- I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE YOUR EFFORTS I MEAN. THE STORY OF CAL STATE LA AS YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THEY'RE SEEING SOME INCREDIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENT- AND THERE'S SOME IMPORTANT GROWTH- AS YOU I'VE INDICATED THAT FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AT YOUR CAMPUS WAS SIX PERCENT. AND NOW I THINK AS I SAW ON YOUR SLIDE IT'S MOVED UP IMPRESSIVE GROWTH AT THE SAME TIME IT IT'S AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES- IN THE SYSTEM SO WE KNOW. WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO AND LET ME JUST SAY THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP WE ARE HERE TO HELP YOU AND YOU'VE IDENTIFIED IN THE CERTAINLY THE SYSTEM IS IDENTIFIED WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN HELP AND CONTINUE TO HELP AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE WANT TO. TALK ABOUT- FURTHER HERE TODAY I WANT TO INVITE SENATOR ROTH WHO HAS BEEN QUIETLY LISTENING AS WELL AS WE FINISH THIS FIRST PANEL I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR DOCTOR MINOR BUT I WANTED TO ALLOW SENATOR ROCK TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS YOU'D LIKE TO ASK TO THAT WONDERFUL. CAMPUS LEADERS OR TO THE SYSTEM. SENATE ROTH YOU'RE ON MUTE. ABOUT UP THERE YOU GOT ABOUT ELEVEN WHEN YOU'RE MY AGE OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- IN ADDITION TO THE ONES I ASSUME YOU'RE GOING TO BE ASKING ABOUT- BUT IT'S PROGRAM IS BASED ON THE LIKE BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT- MY MUSIC NOW. YEAH WE HEAR YOU WE HEAR YOU GREAT. GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOW. FULLY ENSCONCED IN THIS COVERT NINETEEN ONLINE ENVIRONMENT AS THE AS THE SPEAKERS REFERENCED AND WONDERING IF- OF. CSU STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING BROADBAND ACCESS ISSUES- HAVING TO DO WITH THEIR ONLINE ACTIVISTS PATIENT IN THEIR DEGREE PROGRAMS OR WHETHER THIS IS LARGELY AN ISSUE THAT THE CAPE K. THROUGH FOURTEEN- SITES ARE EXPERIENCING. DR MINOR ARE YOU STILL WITH US CAN YOU HELP US SENATE ROTH IN AND THAT QUESTION. I AM I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE A FIRST PASS AND THEN I'LL AND BITE MY CAMPUS COLLEAGUES TO GIVE. A MORE DETAILED- OUR EXPRESSION WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THEIR CAMPUSES LOCALLY WHAT WHAT WE SEE SENATOR IS IN DC YES THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH ACCESSIBILITY. AND OUR ABILITY TO CHEAP STUDENTS CONNECTED TO OUR CAMPUSES I WILL SAY FROM THE SYSTEM OFFERS THAT VARIES QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY ACROSS THE SYSTEM. WELL AS YOU CAN IMAGINE A MORE URBAN AREAS- THE ACCESS TO BROADBAND IS A LOT MORE THAN IDEAS ABOUT SOME MORE WAR AREAS OF THE STATE. AND SOLVED- STRATEGIES AT OUR CAMPUSES OF HATS- OUTLINED TO KEEP STUDENTS CONNECTED TO THE CAMPUSES OF ALSO VARY QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE CHALLENGES NOT ONLY BROADBAND ACCESS IT'S ALSO THE AVAILABILITY OF DEVICES TO CONNECT SO THAT BROADBAND WHERE IT EXISTS. AND ONE EXTENSION OF THAT IS ALSO- APPROPRIATE LEARNING SPACE THAT STUDENTS HAVE WHEN CONNECTED. TO REALLY BE ABLE TO FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE ON THEIR STUDIES SALT IT IS ACCESS TO BROADBAND IT IS THE TECHNOLOGY TO CONNECT WHERE IT EXISTS AND IT'S ALSO- ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE ADEQUATE SPACE TO ACTUALLY- FOCUS ON THEIR STUDIES AND WAVES. THAT KEEP THEM MOVING TOWARDS THEIR DEGREE. OR WE- THEN ARE WE WORKING ON THE- A- THE GENERAL. I REALIZED SOME OF THIS IS CAMPUS AND REGION SPECIFIC BUT A GENERAL PLAN TO DEAL WITH THE BROADBAND ACCESS ISSUES IN THE DEVICE ISSUES. THAT WOULD TIE IN TO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE EITHER HAS DONE WILL DO OR NEEDS TO. PROVIDE SUPPORT AND MONEY TO TRY TO BRIDGE THIS GAP. WE'RE WORKING THESE ISSUES AND ON THE K. THROUGH TWELVE ENVIRONMENT. I'M INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT WE WORK THE ISSUES. IN THE C. ISSUE ANTIC TO THE EXTENT IT EXISTS THE UC ENVIRONMENT AS WELL BUT WE NEED TO WHAT KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE WE NEED THE SYSTEM TO. HELP US THE A DESIGN A STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH IT. THANK YOU SENATOR WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. I ALSO ALSO WOULD BE INTERESTED ABOUT THE- NEED TO PROVIDE BASIC NEEDS SUPPORT TO STUDENTS IN THE- IN THE CSU SYSTEM I ASSUME THAT STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH- PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN GRADUATION SUCCESS. AND IF SO- WHAT MENTAL HEALTH EFFORTS ENHANCED MENTAL HEALTH EFFORTS AND WE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED DURING THIS COUPLE BUT NINETEEN PANDEMIC SENSE I FRANKLY DON'T THINK THIS THIS ONLINE SITUATION- AND THIS PANDEMIC IS GOING TO BE OVER. THAT SO. SARAH GREY LASER MADMAN ADDRESS THAT QUESTION OF COURSE PRESIDENT. Q. IT'S I'M I'M REALLY GLAD- SERRA WROTE THAT YOU ASK BOTH OF THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE AS IT TURNS OUT I HAVE MEANT TO ADDRESS THEM AND- I FORGOT I HAD THIS. ONE LESS LIGHT HERE SO I'LL USE THAT TO- STRUCTURE MY RESPONSE- THE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN- HAVING DIFFICULTY STAYING ENGAGED AND THIS IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING IN THE VIRTUAL MODALITY- WE'RE ALSO BECOMING AWARE OF THE HOME AND FAMILY PRESSURES THAT STUDENTS AND EVEN FACULTY HAVE FACULTY WITH ISSUES WITH CHILD CARE AND SO FORTH AND FINING QUIET TIME. AND FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS PARTICULARLY OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS IN THE SALINAS VALLEY AND OTHER AREAS- THEY HAVE- THEY DON'T HAVE QUITE SPACE AT HOME THEY HAVE A PRESSURES ON THEIR TIME THEY NEED THEIR THE- THE- THERE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY THEY CAN'T THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE TO THEM SO THEY ARE PHYSICALLY- IT MAKES IT QUITE DIFFICULT AND THEN THE BROADBAND AND THE ACCESS TO LAPTOPS IS ARE ALSO ISSUES. WE HAVE RESPONDED BY ISSUING- HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF- HOT SPOTS- AND LAPTOPS TO STUDENTS THAT NEED THEM- BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH BROADBAND IF YOU IF YOU GIVE HOTSPOTS TO STUDENTS THEIR PARTS SOME PARTS OF OUR COUNTY WHERE YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE THE YOU KNOW THE HOSPITAL'S WORK SO- WE ARE MAY WERE COLLABORATING WITH THE- MONTEREY COUNTY- OFFICER DUCATION- AS WELL AS WITH SOME AYE REGIONAL. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT- GROUPS AND THE COUNTY ITSELF TRYING TO DEVELOP A- A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FRANKLY I WOULD SUGGEST THAT CALIFORNIA- WOULD BENEFIT IN MULTIPLE WAYS BY DEVELOPING- UNIVERSAL BROADBAND ADVOCATE ACCESS ACROSS THE STATE SOME THIS IS COMPARABLE TO WHAT SOME AYE ASIAN- COUNTRIES- ARE DOING BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD HAVE A NOT ONLY A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON OUR EDUCATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF OUR ECONOMY- IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO DRAW IN PEOPLE. INTO THE- INTERNET ECONOMY ACROSS THE STATE- IT WOULD BE I THINK A- I'M- TRANSFORMATIONAL IN FOR. PROJECT WELL THE LAST THING I HAD HERE THAT THAT YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT IS- IN TERMS OF WHAT IMPACT THIS IS HAVING ON OUR CAMPUSES. OF PHYSICAL EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE MAINTAIN A ROMAN WE DON'T HAVE STUDENTS ON CAMPUS AND SO ARE OF SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE HOUSING AND DINING HAVE BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED FINANCIALLY AND WE'RE- HAVING TO HELP THEM OUT. BUT WE'RE GONNA HAPPEN YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I'LL BE HANDLING IT. IS NEXT YEAR BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT LAST ISSUE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO THIS CALL BUT NINETEEN. YOU HAVE A LOT OF SUNK COST AND OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH- WITH- HOUSING FACILITIES AND DINING FACILITIES- THAT THE STATE DOESN'T PAY TO BUILD AND THOSE OBLIGATIONS HAVE TO BE SERVICE SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. OTHER COVER THAT GAP FOR YOU SOME WAY CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY WE DO OUR BUDGETING IN THE WAY WE ROLL OUT THE MONEY. AND WITH RESPECT TO THE BROADBAND FRANKLY- I WANT TO GET THE MENTAL HEALTH IN A MINUTE BUT WITH. RESPECT TO THE BROADBAND I THINK THIS IS ONE ISSUE WHERE HIGHER EDUCATION CAN JOIN WITH- THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THAT PIECE OF HIGHER ED AND K. THROUGH TWELVE- SYSTEMS BECAUSE THE ISSUES ARE THE SAME. OF THE SOLUTIONS MAYBE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THE WAY THEY'RE FUNDED MAY BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. BUT THE ISSUES OF THE SAME AND WIENER WE'RE GONNA NEED TO TACKLE THESE. BECAUSE FRANKLY I'M NOT SURE WE KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE. OF ON SITE EDUCATION REALLY LOOKS LIKE. AND THAT ALSO INVOLVES PERHAPS PERHAPS- CONCEPT OF LEARNING CENTERS COUPLED WITH CHILD CARE IN A COLD ENVIRONMENT BETTER- THE CONSTRUCTOR TO AND OPERATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CDC GUIDELINES BUT IN TERMS OF PROVIDING A QUIET SPACE FOR LEARNING A WHILE YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS ARE TAKING CARE OF WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RETHINK THAT TO AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO. HOW TO PROPERLY FUND- THE- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT AND DOING IT IN A WAY THAT COMPLIES AS I SAID WITH. WITH THE COVERT ROLES IN THE CDC GUIDELINES I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL AND I DO WANT TO FURTHER EXPLORE NOT PERHAPS IN THIS IN THIS SETTING THEY WANT TO HIJACK MY CHURCH HEARING BUT IF YOU WANT TO EXPLORE MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THAT WE REALLY CRACKED THE NUT ON THAT. HOW WE HOW WE FUNDED ON YOUR CAMPUSES- IN EARLIER HEARINGS PEOPLE SPOKE TO ME ABOUT THE WARM HAND OFF BUT WHEN YOU DO THE WARM HAND OFF FROM YOUR CAMPUS- TO THIS CIVILIAN I WOULD CALL THEM CIVILIAN PROVIDERS- IT'S ONLY WARM SO LONG AS SOMEBODY HAS A HAS A- METHOD AND MEANS TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES. AND WE HAVE AN ADDRESS THAT. QUESTION SURE THOSE ARE MY TWO- TWO SECURITY QUESTIONS AND I DID FOR YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH AND- I WOULD LIKE TO PAY YOU BACK ON YOUR CONCERN THAT YOU'VE RAISED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH WE- AT THE- STUDENTS SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING THAT WE HELD A CAL POLY POMONA THAT YOU PARTICIPATED IN IN FACT WE TALKED ABOUT. MENTAL HEALTH DURING THAT SESSION- AND THE FACTOID THAT IF THE STUDENT IS IN NEED OF SOME- COUNSELING HELP SOME STRESS- THAT THEY'RE FACING THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE THEIR- CONTINUATION OF THEIR STUDIES. THAT THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME FOR AN APPOINTMENT- IN THE SYSTEM WAS THREE WEEKS. AND- AS WE PULL WE ALL KNOW. THAT IF YOU UNDER STE SAID YOU CAN GET ANY HELP THREE WE- IT'S- REALLY A OOD SITUATION AT ALL. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THERE BUDGET REPLIED REQUEST LAST YEAR. DID COME FORWARD WITH A SPECIFIC REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN THE MENTAL HEALTH AREA- BUT THE CSU DID NOT. AND AT THAT TIME A YEAR AGO I SAID AND I REITERATE THAT I WOULD. ENCOURAGE THE CSU TO LOOK MORE CAREFULLY AT THIS AREA MENTAL HEALTH ON THE CAMPUSES- WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR AGAIN THIS IS ALL ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS. THAT WE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE ONE OUR CAMPUSES AND OUR STUDENTS TO SUCCEED. AND WE OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL BUT- WE WANTED TO BE USED IN THE BEST WAY AND I THINK THAT. SENATE ROTH IT YOU HIGHLIGHTING THIS AGAIN TODAY- AND MY COMMENTS I THINK SPEAK TO THAT. HOW CUTE WE SEE THAT ISSUE AND HOW CONNECTED IT IS TO STUDENT SUCCESS AND HOW WE HAVE TO. DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP. THE CAMPUSES- PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES- WHEN THEY'RE NEEDED NOT IN THREE WEEKS AND WE WE'VE GOT IT WE GOTTA FIND A WAY TO DO THAT BETTER. SO I APPRECIATE SENATOR OUGHT TO BRING THAT ISSUE UP AGAIN AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN. CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ON THAT SPECIFIC POINT- EVEN THOUGH WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATES. THAT WE KNOW HOW CONNECTED THAT IS. I LIKE TO BRING BACK THE DOCTOR MINOR AYE AYE- SO APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THE SYSTEM. IT'S A CHALLENGING PLACE BECAUSE YOU KNOW YU'RE NOT RUNNING THINGS HERE GUIDING THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES AND I. APPRECIATE THE CHALLENGES THAT COME INTO PLAY- IN THAT REGARD- BUT WE HAVE THAT SCENE- IN DOUBT THAT THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED- AND HEARD ABOUT TODAY THAT. WE ARE WE HAVE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE ROBUST ENGAGEMENTS AT AND IS FOR YOUR PATHWAY- AS I MENTIONED SACRAMENTO STATE SAN JOSE STATE LONG BEACH. THEY ARE VERY ROBUST PARTICIPATION IN THE FOUR YEAR PROGRAM OVER TWO THOUSAND. STUDENTS IN MANY OF THE CAMPUSES BUT ON SOME OF THE OTHERS AND I'M I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT CAL STATE LA THEY'RE BEGINNING THE PROGRAM THIS YEAR. THERE REALLY HASN'T BEEN- THESE PROGRAM- OFFERED. AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE AREN'T GREAT ACTIVITIES THAT THE SYSTEM AT THE CAMPUSES ARE DOING TO. ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO TAKE FULL COURSE LOADS IN THE REST. CERTAINLY THOSE HAVE BEEN IMPRESSIVE AND YOU'VE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF THEM IN YOUR TESTIMONY AS AS. WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE OTHER CAMPUSES. BOB BUT AGAIN I GO BACK TO THE POINT THAT IF STUDENTS KNOW ABOUT THE FOR YOUR PATH THEY KNOW THEY CAN GET ON IT THEY WANT TO GET ON IT BUT THEY HAVE TO KNOW. THAT IT'S THERE CAN YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW YOU ARE WORKING WITH THE CAMPUS IS THAT- DON'T HAVE PROGRAMS AT ALL OR HAVE VERY SMALL PARTICIPATION TO GET THEM TO DO MORE TO. PUBLICIZE IT AND TO MAKE THAT OFFERING AVAILABLE. THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK IT'S A VERY. GOOD OBSERVATION ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE VARIANCES ACROSS CAMPUSES. I DO JUST WANT TO MENTION WITH THE PARTICIPATION AND OUR- PROMISE PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM- THE WAYS IN WHICH WE'RE FEATURING THE PROGRAM ARE EVOLVING AND I THINK THE LAST TIME. I WAS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WE MENTIONED NOW THAT EVERY SINGLE STUDENT THAT APPLIES TO THE C. ISSUE- HAS AN OPTION THE EXPRESS THEIR INTEREST IN THIS PROGRAM AND THAT'S THE ISSUE APPLY PORTAL WHICH IS WHERE EVERY STUDENT APPLIES TO THE CSU. SO THAT IS LED TO US BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE PROGRAM. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER COMPONENTS OF THIS THAT I JUST WANT TO BE CAREFUL AND CLEAR ABOUT THE OTHER HAS TO DO WITH THE SHIFT ON OUR CAMPUSES- TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE STUDENTS NOT ONLY A FULL COURSE LOAD OR FIFTEEN UNITS BUT IT'S THE RIGHT FIFTEEN UNITS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR PARTICULAR DEGREE PROGRAM SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE ALSO SEEING. OUR CAMPUSES DO OVER TIME IS TO BE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE AVAILABLE COURSES ON THEIR CAMPUSES A LINE THOSE COURSES WITH DEGREE PROGRAMS AND I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE I WAS SPEAKING WITH THE STUDENT- LAST TERM- THE INTERESTED IN TAKING. UNITS IN TO TAKE A LOOK HER. HOWEVER THE FIFTY UNITS WORKS. WITH HER DEGREE PROGRAM TAKE THIS COURSE NOT BACKWARDS. ONE IN. AVAILABLE ENACT HER. AND SO SHE COULD HAVE TAKEN A FULL LOCAL BUT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKING COURSES THAT WERE NOT ALIGNED WITH HER DEGREE PROGRAMS SO SOME OF IT IS A BILE- REALIZING GREATER EFFICIENCY AND ALIGNMENT AND OF COURSE SCHEDULE. AND THEN THE THIRD COMPONENT OF THIS I THINK IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT IS JUST YOUR CAPACITY. AND SO YOU'RE SEEING SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES MADE VERY VERY- ARCHES BUT ALSO DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT INVESTING IN- COURSE SCHEDULE IN THE CAPACITY ON THEIR CAMPUS TO DELIVER THOSE COURSES NOT ONLY FOR STUDENTS WHO. HAVE INDICATED INTEREST IN- PROMISE PROGRAM BUT FOR ALL STUDENTS ACROSS THE CAMPUS AND SO MY EXPECTATION SENATORS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE AN UPTICK BOTH IN THE PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM. AND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WERE TAKEN UP FOR COURSE LOW AND I THINK THE PROMISING INDICATION FOR US IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING. AMONG OUR FIRST YEAR STUDENTS AND BOTH SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THAT POPULATION. FOR INDEED TAKEN A FULL LOW. WELL THE YOU AND THOSE ARE UPS. AND I- I TAKE THEM TO HEART AND IT MATCHES UP WITH WHAT A LOT OF STUDENTS I HAVE SAID IT WHICH IS THAT THEY CAN'T GET THE COURSES THEY NEED TO GET THROUGH. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THERE MAY BE SOME RESISTANCE ON SOME OF THE CAMPUSES TO FULLY PUBLICIZED. THE PROGRAM BECAUSE IT MAKES IT CLEAR THE COMMITMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY TO. CREATE THAT PATHWAY AND MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS CAN GET THOSE COURSES SO THEY CAN GET THROUGH. IT IS A DILEMMA WHEN WE WANT OUR UNIVERSITIES TO BE AS OPEN AND WELCOMING AS POSSIBLE TO AS MANY STUDENTS AS POSSIBLE. AND YOUR ENROLLMENT GROWTH SPEAKS TO WHAT A GREAT VALUE IT IS AND- AND THE IMPORTANCE THAT STUDENTS SEE AND TRYING TO- IN ROLE AT SCSU. BUT THEN IT STUDENTS ARE GETTING THROUGH. THAT THAT'S THAT'S A LOT OF UNFORTUNATE FAILURE- BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE TAKING ON THE DEBT THEY'RE TAKING A TIME BUT THEY'RE NOT GETTING THEIR DEGREE SO WE HAVE TO TRY TO FIND THAT BALANCE. WE HAVE TO BE PRIORITIZED. DIG WHEN THE STUDENT IS IN A ROLE WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE MAKING SURE THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL- AND THAT'S THAT'S A CHALLENGING THING TO DO BECAUSE AGAIN WE WANT TO BE OPEN ARMS TO- TO EVERYONE- I- YOU KNOW WHAT. IT A FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENT OF THE PROMISE PROGRAM IS THE FOCUS ON UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS- AND THAT THE PRIORITY FOR REGISTRATION THE PRIORITY FOR- ENGAGEMENT- WITH THE STUDENTS IS ON THE UNDER REPRESENTED SO IT DOES GO TO THE HEART OF WHAT. APPEARS TO BE THE STILL THE ONE OF THE BIGGER STICKING BLOCKS TOOK THE PROGRESS. IN THE GRADUATION- INITIATIVE IS THOUGH UNDER REPRESENTED. SO WE HAVE TO MATCH THOSE THINGS UP AND- AGAIN I SAID THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP AND WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP YOU- AND SUCCEEDING. IN DOING SO. ONE OF THE THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE- IN TERMS OF SETTING POLICY IS THE AVAILABILITY OF DATA. BECAUSE WE WANT THE FACTS ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN ALL ASPECTS OF STATE GOVERNMENT INCLUDING HIGHER EDUCATION. AND SO WE ARE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING WHO IS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROMISE PROGRAM ARE WE REACHING THE CONSTITUENCIES THAT WE ARE TRYING TO REACH WITH IT IN TERMS OF UNDER REPRESENTED. AND SO- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SPEAK TODAY OR WE CAN TALK AND FOLLOW UP OUTSIDE OF THIS HEARING. BUT WE REALLY ARE LOOKING FOR THAT THAT THAT THAT THE DATA THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED ON THE PROMISE PROGRAM AND WHO. WHO ARE WE HELPING ARE WE HELP AND WE WANT TO HELP EVERYBODY BUT ARE WE HELPING THE RIGHT FOLKS ARE WE INVESTING OUR RESOURCES IN THE RIGHT WAY. I KNOW THAT'S YOUR- COMMITMENT AS WELL- AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THAT DATA REALLY WOULD HELP ALL OF US. MAKE SURE WE'RE MAKING THE BEST CHOICES DR MINOR. WHENEVER I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION AND I WILL TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO GO BACK TO OUR TEAM- IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS WE POSSIBLY CAN ABOUT PRECISELY WHO'S PARTICIPATING. AND THE PROMISE PROGRAM ACROSS OUR CAMPUSES BUT I THINK. THE DELICATE BALANCE THAT YOU JUST ARTICULATED IS SO TRUE. PARTICULARLY WITH UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS OR STUDENTS WERE THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE FOR FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS FOR OUR STUDENTS WHO COME FROM LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AND THIS BALANCE BETWEEN MAKING IT AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS AND THEM BEING ABLE TO FULLY CAPITALIZE ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A FULL COURSE LOAD WE KNOW. THAT THOSE STUDENTS TEND TO. BE MORE LIKELY TO WORK. NO STUDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE FAMILY OBLIGATIONS THEREBY AND PERHAPS IN SOME CASES NOT ALL CASES LIMITING THEIR ABILITY. TO ACTUALLY TAKE FIFTEEN UNITS IN ANY GIVEN SEMESTER SOL I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND ONE THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING. SOME ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT. AB TERRIFIC AND I WE'RE GETTING FROM THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE IN A MOMENT. WHO CAN TALK ABOUT- COURSE LOADS- AND I THINK THEY'RE STUDY SHOWS THAT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THEIR COURSE LOADS HAVE REALLY GONE UP OVER THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS I MEAN AGAIN IT'S TAKE A CREDIT TO THAT. CAMPUS LEADERSHIP IN THE FACULTY AND THE AND THE SYSTEM. TO SEE THAT EIGHT EIGHT. I'M NOT SO SURE THAT THE WORK OBLIGATION IS NECESSARY EIGHTY EIGHT DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN A STUDENT'S DESIRED IT STILL TAKE THE FULL COURSE LOAD TO GET THROUGH IN FOUR YEARS. THEY KNOW THE ECONOMICS OF THE MATTER TO- THAT THE QUICKER THEY CAN GET 2 DEGREES THE MORE MONEY THEY'RE GOING TO SAVE. THE GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO EARN MORE AND ENTER OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM. SO AT LEAST THE DATA THAT I HAVE SEEN IS THAT THAT THAT- THERE ISN'T A BIG DIFFERENTIAL- IN- THE STUDENTS WHO ARE TRYING TO TAKE THAT FULL COURSE LOAD TO AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THEIR LIFE SO. AB ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT THEIR THEIR PRESENCE- WITH MANY STILL IN ANY CASE- I I'VE I THANK YOU AGAIN I THINK I WANT TO SAY. CHANCELLOR WHY IS CLOSE TO RETIREE I THINK THAT THIS. GRADUATION INITIATIVE IS ONE OF HIS GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS- ABDOMEN MANY. AS LEADER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. AND DR MINOR I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN BY HIS SIDE- CHEERLEADING AND GUIDING OUR CAMPUS. IN DOING SOME GREAT WORK HERE IN THIS AREA. AND I APPLIED TO ALL OF YOUR GOOD WORK AND I CERTAINLY- CELEBRATE CHANCELLOR WHITE'S RETIREMENT- GIVEN SOME OF THESE INCREDIBLE SUCCESSES. AT TAT THE SYSTEM IS HAVING CERTAINLY THE CAMPUS IS DIRECTLY. ARE HAVING AND GETTING. STUDENTS THROUGH TO GRADUATION- IT'S A GREAT GREAT CHEAP AND PLEASE EXTEND. OUR GOOD WISHES TO CHANCER WHITE- ON HIS WELL DESERVED RETIREMENT. OKAY I WANT TO THANK- DOCTOR MINOR I WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT- CHILL I WANT TO THANK DR GóMEZ FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS FIRST PANEL PROVIDING THE GREAT INSIGHT THAT WE HAVE FOR TODAY. AND I WANT TO REITERATE AND I KNOW SENATOR ROTH SHARES THESE THOUGHTS WHICH IS THAT.

HAD MADE IN HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT TODAY SO WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. YOUR- GREAT LEADERSHIP. THANK YOU SENATORS OKAY WE'RE GONNA TURN NEXT TO SOME OTHER AT GREAT- IT EXPERTS AND THEN FOLKS WITH GREAT INSIGHT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE CAMPUSES I WOULD LIKE TO TURN NEXT TO DR JACOB JACKSON HE IS A RESEARCH FELLOW AT THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION CENTER.

THANK YOU SO MUCH THANKS ARE GLAZER. THAN SEVEN IN A ROW. OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFIED. MY NAME'S JACOB JACKSON I'M RESEARCH FELLOW AT UPAC ADOPTED NONPARTISAN POLICY RESEARCH FOR COMMENTS TODAY ARE ABOUT A RECENT REPORT ON COURSE TAKING ON TIME COMPLETION AT THE AT THE CSU- SO. AS YOU'VE- A CUSTOMER TODAY THIS ISSUE IS ACTUALLY MAKING IMPRESSIVE STRIDES TOWARD ITS GRADUATION INITIATIVE GOAL OF 70% SIX YEARS AND 40% WITHIN FOUR YEARS. HOWEVER FEWER THAN A THIRD OF UNDERGRADUATE YOU FINISH YOUR DEGREE IN FOUR YEARS. EACH YEAR A STUDENT SPENDS EACH ADDITIONAL YEAR STUDENT SPENDSTHE IN COLLEGE COMES WITH ASSOCIATED COSTS NOT JUST TUITION ABOUT THE BOOKS BE. BUT DEGREE IN THAT AT MORE SIGNIFICANT HOWEVER IT IS THE OPPORTUNITY COST OF NOT ENTERING THE WORK FORCE OR SEE A DOCTOR THEY WELL THAT COSTS AROUND FORTY FIVE THE FIRST OUTING- WORKERS AT SEE IF YOU ARE AT THEIR GRADUATION THIS YEAR AND MOREOVER HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED STUDENTS OFTEN CATERS EXTRA COSTS AS THEIR PERSISTENT GAPS IT FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES BY RACE FAMILY INCOME. AND FIRST GENERATION STATUS. WHAT WAY TO CLOSE GAPS A FOCUS ON GAPS IN OPPORTUNITY. AND OUR RECENT REPORT WE LOOK AT ONE ASPECT BONTA GRADUATION WHICH IS COURSE TAKING EARLY AND A COLLEGE STUDENT'S COLLEGE CAREER. ENABLING AND ENCOURAGING STUDENTS TAKE FULL COURSE LOADS HAS BEEN A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AS WELL AS A CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. IN A RESEARCH WE USED PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA FROM THE CSU HER ALL THE- BUT ALSO USED FOR OUR CAPTAINS WHO VOLUNTEERED I. LONGITUDINAL STUDENT- I MADE IT THROUGH OR A SIMPLE THE TODAY I'LL JUST QUICKLY CHECK OUR OUR MAIN FIRE. THE FIRST DO NOT JACKSON JUST HOLD ON I JUST DOCTOR JACKSON FINANCIALLY PURPOSES OF COURSE THANK YOU JACKSON HOLD ON FOR JUST ONE SECOND WE'RE I THINK WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE TECHNICAL ISSUE I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO CLEAR IT UP SO THAT YOUR- YOUR- VOICE COMES IN BETTER. ALL RIGHT YOU COULD BE THE. MAYBE A BETTER. I SAY THAT AGAIN DOCTOR JACKSON'S IT IS JUST IT ANY BETTER THE LITTLE BIT THAT. YEAH RIGHT I'LL BE ALLOWED IN A STAY OUT THANK YOU. BURKE STUDENTS SURVIVAL TIME AT- TO. BUT IT TAKES IN A OF THREE MINUTES THIRTY PER YEAR I'M- BUT STUDENT. ENROLLS ABOUT THIRTEEN UNIT BURKE THE MOST RECENT DATA AROUND 43% OF UNDER ENROLLING TO. JUST A THIRD ONLY FIVE YEARS. THANK YOU JACK AGAIN LET ME ADD AGAIN WORK ARE MORE LIKELY TO DOCTOR JACKSON INTERNET YOU. I THINK THE TECH WE HAVE SOME TECH ISSUES THAT YOU I THINK THE IT THAT I'M FROM TECHNICAL STAFF IS FOR YOU TO. DISCONNECT AND RECONNECT AGAIN. AND SO THE ME ASK YOU TO TRY TO DO THAT IF YOU WILL. AND WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT LET ME BRING IN A STUDENT THAT DO. THAT ALSO PROVIDE TO ABOUT. TO YOUR TECHNICAL ISSUES. HI ED IF YOU COULD TALK WITH THEM DIRECTLY YOU HAVE IS NUMBER SO YOU CAN WORK WITH HIM TO GET. A BETTER CONNECTION. OKAY BUT SO LET ME DO THIS FOR WE'RE WAITING AT OUR WORK. ON THAT THAT.

PROGRESS ON HER STUDIES AND- BUDGETS ARE ARE YOU THERE. NEXT TRIP CHECK WELL I HOPE YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS IN INFORMATIVE FACT CONVERSATION WITH HAVING SO FAR AND WE WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY WHILE WE WAIT TO CLEAR UP DOCTOR JACKSON'S TECHNICAL PROBLEMS. WELCOME THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING CHAIR GLAZER AND SENATOR ROCK- AS MENTIONED EARLIER MY NAMES ARE CREATED AND I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE CAL STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS NEARLY HALF A MILLION CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I AM A GRADUATE STUDENT AT CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE PURSUING A MASTER'S INSTRUCTIONS HEARING. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE THIS MORNING TO TALK ABOUT MY FELLOW STUDENTS AND THE HARDSHIPS THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. IN A RECENT STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE COMMISSION 71% OF STUDENTS REPORTED LOSING SOME OR ALL OF THEIR INCOME. AND 46% REPORTED EXPERIENCING A CHANGE IN THEIR LIVING SITUATION. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESPONSE AND RESPONDENTS ALSO REPORTED CONCERN ABOUT PAYING YOUR TUITION AND FEES AS WELL AS PAYING FOR TECHNOLOGY AND FOOD. THESE NUMBERS MATCH WHAT WE AS HE'S A HAPPY HEARING FROM OUR FELLOWS. OVER THE LAST NINE MONTHS. MANY STUDENTS ARE STILL STRUGGLING WITH ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY WHETHER THAT IS ACCESS TO A LAPTOP OR RELIABLE AFFORDABLE INTERNET CONNECTION. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN A HIGHER AMOUNT OF STUDENTS STRUGGLING OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. THESE ISSUES WHERE THEY'RE VERY LONG AND PRESENT BEFORE COLBERT NINETEEN. A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STUDY DONE BY THE CSU FOUND THAT FORTY ONE POINT 6% OF OUR STUDENTS WERE FOOD INSECURE IN TEN POINT 9% OF OUR STUDENTS REPORTED EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS. ANOTHER MAJOR AREA OF CONCERN FOR STUDENTS AS MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES. STUDENTS ARE FACING ANXIETY STRESS. AND DEPRESSION AS THEY CONFRONT THE CHALLENGES OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND ADAPTING TO A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT MANY STUDENTS HAVE REPORTED THAT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS AND AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE WAIT TIMES TO GET AN APPOINTMENT ARE TOO LONG. MORE THAN EVER STUDENT STUDENTS EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF FINANCIAL AID IN ACHIEVING THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION. ABOUT SOME SORT OF FINANCIAL AID WELL ARMED WELL AROUND- 60% HAVE A TUITION FULLY COVERED. ALTHOUGH THE COUNT STATE AID SYSTEM COVERS FOR THE MAJORITY OF CS STUDENT ACOSTA JEWISH. THAT THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE WITH. TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE WHICH INCLUDES THE COST OF HOUSING FOOD TRANSPORTATION BOOKS AND SUPPLIES ARE NOT WELL COVERED. THIS LEADS MANY OF OUR LOW INCOME AND UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS TO TAKE OUT SIGNIFICANT DEBT. A REPORT DONE BY CSSA. WHEN THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS DECUS FOUND THAT EIGHTY IN C. IS USED WHO GRADUATED THAT HAD OR CAN FROM. OF AN FAMILY IN. OF FOURTH DOLLARS A LESS. ADDITIONALLY WHILE THE OVER PERCENTAGE OF SPECIES TO GRADUATE WITH DEBT AROUND FIFTY. THE STUDY THAT SO 6% AFTER AND STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH THE- THIS IS A NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR STATE. BOTH THINK AND TIMES AND TO WORK TO THE TRYING TO. WELL THERE ISN'T ANTICIPATION FEDERAL REDUCE THE CAR DUE TO THE PENDING. WE HAVE SEEN OUR NUMBERS IN. THIS IS PROM AS GIVE WITHIN A THAT THE CSU OR- WITH THE GI TRI FIVE NAY. THESE NUMBERS WOULD NOT BE. WITHOUT THE PROCESS OF OURS. ARE FACULTY STAFF. AS AN FOCUSED ORGANISED. AND WE'RE GOING TO. SEES THIS IS ALL PLEASED TO SEE THE- THAT THE G. I. TO TWENTY FIVE HAS MADE IN ELIMINATING THE EQUITY GAPS. THIS IS ALSO RECOGNIZED THE IN OF THE CALIFORNIA PROBLEMS PROGRAM WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WAS AUTHORED BY TWO BY TERROR GLAZER. IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATION IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN SEASONS HE WAS HAPPY TO SEE THAT SEVEN THOUSAND AND SIXTY SIX NEW STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM. FOUNDED WE SEE OR LAWSUIT ARE FAKE. A ENORMOUS. AND MIX OF GLOBAL KIND. MANY STE STILL HOPE. SEVEN OR FOR US TO MOVE FOR WE ASK THAT THERE IS A KING TO INVEST- AND COLLABORATION. IN OUR STUDENTS SO THAT NOT WE ONLY SUCCEED BUT WE MAY SURVIVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SORRY EFFORTS FOR THAT- WONDERFUL INSIGHT WE APPRECIATED OF COURSE YOUR FOCUS ON FINANCIAL AID AND STUDENT DEBT. IS ROTH IS RIGHT ON THE MARK- AND OF COURSE- THE WORST OF ALL IS THAT A STUDENT WHO ENCOURAGED THAT DEBT- AND THEN ISN'T ABLE TO GET THEIR DEGREE- THAT THAT'S A REAL BIG TRAGEDY AND- UNFORTUNATELY THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS ARE IN SEEM TO BE IN THAT POSITION EVERY YEAR AND- I KNOW ALL OF OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THEM AND THAT'S- THAT'S OF COURSE WE'RE TRYING TO THAT GAP WE MUST CLOSE IT WE JUST MUST- IT SAID- YOU KNOW I DREAM CRASHING. ON THE ROCKS WHEN- THEY CAN'T FINISH AND- AND ALL OF US SERVE COMMITTED TO TRYING TO FIND THOSE BOTTLENECKS THE ROAD BLOCKS THAT ARE CREATING THAT. BARRIER TO COMPLETION- DO YOU FIND OUT WHEN YOU TALK TO THE STATE- IT THE STUDENT COMMUNITY AND I KNOW WE'RE DOING YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO GENERALIZE IT YOU KNOW ITS TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. ALL OF THEM HAVE UNIQUE SITUATIONS. YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THE EARLIER. THAT ON SOME CAN. SAN JOSE AND CAL STATE LONG BEACH INSECT STATE THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS HAVE BEEN ROLLED. IN THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM WHERE THEY KNOW THAT FOR YOUR PAST THAT THEY DO SO. THEY TAKE THE FIFTEEN UNITS THAT THERE'S AGO PROMISE A GUARANTEE THAT THEY CAN GET THROUGH IN FOUR YEARS. SO WE HAVE A ROBUST PARTICIPATION ON SOME CAMPUSES AND THEN THEN WE HAVE A DESERT IN OTHERS YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT OVER THAT ON THAT ISSUE. I THINK YOU KNOW TO HARM HONEST HERE. IT'S JUST LIKE YOU SAID VASTLY DIFFERENT ACROSS THE CSU SO IT REALLY IS I THINK AT THIS POINT JUST CAMPUS DEPENDENT AND THE EFFORTS THAT EACH CAMPUS ONE SUPPORT- IN PROMOTING THE PROGRAM. WELL IT WE APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CSSA AND- PARTNERSHIP AND TRYING TO BRING THE AWARENESS OF THAT PROGRAM TO SOME OF THESE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE LOW PARTICIPATION RATES. SO LOW WE COULD WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL AID. AND TRIAL LOWER OR ELIMINATE STUDENT DEBT. THAT WE CAN MAKE A MORE STUDENTS AWARE OF THIS CLEAR PATHWAY TO SUCCESS THAT THAT IS OUT THERE FOR THEM. BUT WE APPRECIATE YOUR PARTICIPATION WITH US TODAY AND THEN OF COURSE THE- THAT THE GREAT PARTNERSHIP THAT THE STUDENT ASSOCIATION HAS HAD WITH MANY OF US HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING INVOLVED. I JUST WANT TO CHECK US SENATE ROTH BEFORE WE GO ON WITH THE YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THERE. BUT THE NUMBERS I JUST WANT TO- COMMENDED THE TESTIMONY VERY VERY- VERY VERY IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE BROADBAND IN MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL AS THE- COST OF EDUCATION AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON THAT SO. KEEP DOING A GREAT JOB YOU'RE DOING AND WILL TRY TO- HAS THE GOVERNOR SAYS MEET THE MOMENT IN THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR REID. SO WE'RE GONNA GO BACK AND SEE A DOCTOR JACKSON'S CONNECTION HAS IMPROVED SO WE CAN GO BACK AND HEAR HIS TESTIMONY DR JACKSON ARE YOU THERE. I AM HERE TO SOUND ANY BETTER IT'S A LOT BETTER SO I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ASK TO GO BACK TO THE START OF YOUR TESTIMONY SO WE CAN MAKE SURE WE GET ALL OF THAT ON THE RECORD AND I KNOW THERE'S GREAT INSIGHT THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO MISS. THANK YOU FOR. WORKING TO OUR TECHNICAL PROBLEMS. AFFECTS US SO THANK YOU SAID A GLAZER SAID IRAQ FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. MY NAME'S JACOB JACKSON RESEARCH FELLOW AT FTA SEE WHICH IS AN- PROFIT- PARTISAN POLICY RESEARCH OR. MICHAEL TODAY ABOUT A REASON REPORT N. TAKING AND- ON TIME THE- CAL. STATE AS YOU'VE SEEN FROM THE EARLY TESTED. CSU IS MAKING IMPRESSIVE. STRIDES TOWARD ITS GRADUATION. OF GOLD OF SEVENTY. SIX YEARS AND 40% FOR YEARS. HOWEVER STILL FEWER THAN A THIRD OF UNDERGRADUATES FINISH YOUR DEGREE. REPORTER TO GREET HIM FOUR YEARS. EACH ACTUALLY. STUDENT A GRAD CONGRESO. ACROSS NOT TUITION BUT BOOKS. BE SPLITTING X. WHICH CAN ADD THOUSANDS THE COST OF A- AND LATER. STUDENT AT. MOST OF THE- HOWEVER IS OPPORTUNE. COST OF NOT. THE WERE FORCE WERE CS USED. TO CALL WELL. BACKUP THE RAMP FIVE. DOLLARS FOR. BASED ON CSU EARNINGS DAY. MORE- HISTORICALLY. UNDER STUDENTS OFTEN HEY THIS EXTRA COST. IS THERE. GAPS FOR YOUR- RATES. BY RACE. FAMILY AND PER GENERATION. ONE TO CLOSE THESE OUTCOME GAPS IN TO FOCUS GAP IN UPPER. AND ARE POOR LOOK AT ONE OF THESE EFFORT GAPS- THE ASPECT OF ON TIME GREAT. COURSE TAKE EARLY. IN A STUDENT'S CALL CAREER. ANY AND ENCOURAGING STILL TAKE FULL LOADS. HAVE BEEN A MAJOR OF THE- INITIATIVE TO TWENTY FIVE AS AS YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA. BROKE IN OUR RESEARCH WE USED PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA FROM THE CSU ENROLLMENT PASSWORDS BUT ALL WE GOT. DAY FROM FOUR K. VOLUNTEERED THEIR D. IDENTIFIED LONGITUDINAL DATA. AND SALES. THE MAIN FINDING FROM THIS. FIRST MOST STUDENTS DO NOT TAKE UP UNITS TO BE ON TO GRADUATE FOUR EARS. OUR FINANCIAL PURPOSES STUDENTS ARE FULL TIME AT UNITS TO- BUT IT TAKES AVERAGE OF FIFTEEN YEARS TERM THIRTY PER YEAR. AFTER GRADUATE TIME THE TYPICAL STUDENT ROLLS IN ONLY ABOUT THIRTEEN UNITS PARTNER. THE MOST RECENT DATA WE HAVE SHOW THAT AROUND 43% OF UNDERGRADUATES ENROLLED FIFTEEN UNITS WHICH IS UP FROM JUST ABOUT A THIRD. FIVE YEARS AGO. SECOND OUR STUDENTS ENROLLING IN A FULL COURSE LOAD ARE MORE LIKELY TO FINISH ON TIME. CENTRAL FIFTEEN UNITS AND THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE VERY FIRST TERM ARE ABOUT ELEVEN PERCENTAGE POINTS MORE LIKELY ABOUT TWICE AS LIKELY TO FINISH ON TIME. AND A LITTLE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE IN SIX YEARS AS WELL. AND THIS IS NOT JUST A CASE OF MORE PREPARED STUDENTS TAKING MORE UNITS AND THE MORE LIKE THE GRADUATE ANYWAY. WE WERE ABLE TO USE THE STUDENT LEVEL LONGITUDINAL DATA FROM THE CAMPUSES. TO DETERMINE THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP EXISTS FOR. HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS FOR FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS FOR STUDENTS WITH LOWER HIGH SCHOOL GPA SONORA CITY SCORES. ADD TO THAT NO WE FOUND SOME REALLY. A IT'S ENOUGH TO PROMISING TRENDS OF COURSE. IT'S A CALIFORNIA PROMISED. AND A GRADUATION IN TWENTY FIVE START. ALMOST EVERY. HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED. THERE WE GO HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED THE NUMBER OF FRESHMEN TAKING FIFTEEN UNITS ARE MORE IT IS ALSO ON PAGE SIXTEEN OF THE REPORT- YOU CAN SEE THE CSU'S TOTAL THERE- IN IN KIND OF HATCHED ORANGE. ONLY TWO CAMPUSES DIDN'T. WE'RE ALREADY VERY HIGH IN THE THAT- PERCENT PRESS TAKING FIFTEEN MORE UNITS VERY FIRST ARE. WELCOME TAKING INCREASED FOR ALL STUDENTS MANY GAPS STILL REMAIN BETWEEN GROUPS. AS YOU CAN SEE ON PAGE NINETEEN THE REPORT IN FALL OF 2019407% OF WHITE STUDENTS ENROLLED FIFTEEN OR MORE UNITS COMPARED 239% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND FORTY PER EIGHT POINT GAP BETWEEN FIRST GENERATION STUDENT COLLEGES AND APPEARS AND THERE'S A SIX POINT GAP BETWEEN HEALTH GRANT RECIPIENTS OF THEIR PEERS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT EARLY COURSE TAKING MOMENTUM. SEEMS TO HELP ALL TYPES OF STUDENTS AND IT SUGGESTS THAT CLOSING GAPS IN OPPORTUNITY. COULD HELP CLOSE THESE GAPS IN OUTCOMES THAT WE SEE LATER ON. SO. WE SUGGEST ENABLING AND FACILITATING MORE STUDENTS TO ENROLL AND FULL COURSE LOADS CAMPUSES ARE USING THEIR CALIFORNIA PROMISE PROGRAM PLEDGES WHICH STUDENTS RECEIVE PARTY REGISTRATION AND OTHER BENEFITS FOR STAYING ON TRACK TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS SOME CAMPUSES ARE PRE ENROLLING STUDENTS- INCOMING STUDENTS FOR FIFTEEN UNITS MANY DOESN'T REPORTED CHANGES IN HOW STUDENTS ARE ADVISED. CAN'T SHOULD ALSO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCREASE COURSE LOAD AMONGST FROM THE STORE UNDERSERVED GROUPS AND SUPPORT THEM EITHER IN THE OURSES. THE STRATEGIES MAYBE THAN THE ONE BEING EMPLOYED CURRENTLY. WE ALSO SUGGESTED CAMPUS ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO MEET THESE INCREASED RESTORE. AND IN. IN COURSE TAKING. OUR STUDENTS OPTING FOR LET'S SAY FIFTEEN YEARS SINCE OF TWELVE STILL NO ONE BASED THE SAME. BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT THE CAMPUSES PROVIDE MORE COURSES WITH NOBODY JEWISH MONEY. IN RECENT YEARS CALL JUST USED EDITION GRADUATE AND ISSUE DOLLARS. INCREASED FOR CORE. MISTAKE SATURDAY FUNDING FOR MORE YOU KNOW STOPS THE REVENUE FOR COLLEGE. OR CULTURAL MORE STOOD. AND MORE CLASSES. AND LASTLY THE PANDEMIC A MAKING THESE EVEN HARDER ADVISOR. ONLINE COURSES CHANGES IN STUDENT MAJOR IN FRONT. ARE THEY'VE ALL JEAN A GREAT DEAL. IT'LL BE IMPORTANT CONTINUE TO MONITOR. OR STICKING SEE IF THE GREAT STRIDES EARLY COURSE TAKING OUR- AND WILL MONITOR THEM OF EARLY TAKING AND OTHER CHANGES THE CSU SUCH AS A LEARNING. ON ON TIME. RATES ARE GRADUATE RATES AND GET OF THE CS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU DR JACKSON I'M GLAD WE WERE ABLE TO CLEAR UP THE- THE TECHNICAL ISSUES IN HERE YOU'RE TERRIFIC TESTIMONY- SO IT IS YOU. OBVIOUSLY HAVE THIS FOCUS ON THE FULL THAT TAKING THE FIFTEEN UNITS TAKING IT EARLY. MAKING A BIG DIFFERENCE- IRRESPECTIVE OF THE OF WHERE THAT STUDENT COMES FROM A BENEFITS THE UNDER REPRESENTED IT BENEFITS EVERYONE- BUT THE YOU KNOW THE BAY. THAT THEY YOU'RE HERE FROM THE CAMPUSES IS THAT- YOU KNOW THE BOTTLENECKS COURSES THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE THAT THEY NEED AS A PREREQUISITE BUT BABY ISN'T AVAILABLE. DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS AT PERSPECTIVES ABOUT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE BREAK THAT DOWN. HOW DO WE HELP THE CAMPUSES HAD A WE BREAK DOWN THOSE BARRIERS SO THAT- THE STUDENTS WHO ARE TAKING THE FULL COURSE LOADS ARE ABLE TO TAKE THE COURSES THAT THEY NEED TO BE DONE ANY WORK ON THAT OR ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT THAT THAT ISSUE. A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE GET A REPORT ON GRADUATION THE FIRST GRADUATION INITIATIVE WHICH WAS AIMED. AT SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATES. AND WE FOUND THAT- CAMPUSES WHERE TRYING TO STREAMLINE THEIR DEGREE PROGRAMS. SO THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THOSE BOTTLENECK COURSES. THAT WAS ONE OF ONE OF THEIR STRATEGIES AND IT CONTINUES WE WANT OTHER STRATEGIES- YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST A FIFTEEN UNIT- BLANK CHECK IT TO BE THE RIGHT FIFTEEN. AND IT CONSIDER USING ANALYTICS FIGURE THAT OUT A LOT OF CAMPUS WE TALKED TO WERE OPTIMISED EVEN IN THE FACE OF CODE THAT THEY CAN GET. THE COURSES THE STUDENTS- THAT THAT NEEDED THEM THE RIGHT TO STUDENTS IN THE THEM- A SO THEY'RE USING TECH. THAT THAT IT TO GET PAST THIS. BUT YES IT'S A MAJOR CAN THAT THAT IS NOT JUST COURSES EVERY BUT THE RIGHT COURSES ARE. IT'S IT IN YOUR STUDY- AS- A SIMPLE. POINT THAT NINE PER. IS IN PERCENT OF THIS TO THAT ENTER. HOPE TO GET AND FOR YEARS IS THAT- DAY COME FOR EUROPE. I COME FROM A SURVEY AND ASH SURVEY. OF AND I EXPECT THAT. CSU STUDENTS ARE MUCH- THERE'S A THERE'S ANOTHER- I THINK OVERSEE PER OF YOU SEE STUDENTS EXPECTED SAME THING- WE DON'T HAVE NUMBERS ON ON- YOU ON CSU STUDENT EXPECTATION- BUT IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT. MORE STUDENTS LIKELY EXPECTS TO GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS THAT DO GRADUATING FOUR YEARS. AND SO WE HAVE HEARD- A- IN SOME WAYS I GUESS IT'S A REALITY CHECK- THAT THAT THAT. IS STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE TAKING OUT FINANCIALLY BUT THEY THEY MAY NEED TO WORK- AND THAT CREATES- THAT ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW BERRIER THAT THEY HAVE TO OVERCOME IN TERMS OF TAKING A FULL LOAD. OF UNITS TO IT ANY THAT DATA ABOUT THE DESIRE DO YOU SEE ANY BREAKDOWN IN TERMS OF THOSE- BASED ON. STUDENTS WHO ARE WORKING IN THOSE WHO ARE NOT. SO THAT DATA WAS AVAILABLE AT IT'S REALLY A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION- I THINK- AS EARLY- GIVEN EARLIER TESTIMONY I THINK A COMEDY OF MANY THINGS TO. ONE IS THAT THE COURTS THE STUDENTS NEED ARE- ONE IS THAT THAT I'M NOT COURSE IS AVAILABLE AND ANOTHER IS- THE BEST. I IT- STUDENTS BEING AND- OR- HAVE TO WORK. I KNOW BEING ABLE TO TAKE A FULL LOAD- SURELY NOT ALL- WILL BE ABLE TO ENROLL IN FULL COURSE BUT I THINK. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE- INCREASES IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS- YOU CAN SEE THAT- IT'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INCREASED AT ALMOST EVERY SINGLE CAMPUS. SO THERE WAS UNMET DEMANDS THERE THAT THAT WAS EITHER CREATED OR OR OR- OR WORKED AROUND EVEN FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE POTENTIALLY WORKING- AND SO I THINK THAT THERE'S IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN AND EVEN INCREASE. THOSE NUMBERS EITHER. STILL NEED TO BE A FOCUS ON THIS. THANK YOU ARE. REID THANK BEFORE WE MOVE. I WANT TO MAKE SURE INCLUDE YOU. FROM. YOU'RE JUST ONE- YOU KNOW GIVEN THE FACT THAT MOST OF YOU CAN. OKAY IS NOW ONLINE FORCED. THE SCOPE NINETY- ENDEMIC THAT THE US- AND FRANK THE THAT ON MY AND- MAY CONTAIN- ONCE WE RID TO CAMP SAID YOU AT LEAST IN PERILLO ON CARE SAID YOU. WHAT IMPACT DO YOU. I BELIEVE THAT THE ONLINE EDUCATION- INITIATIVE WILL HAVE ON THESE BOTTLENECKS COURSES AND THE INABILITY TO OUR STUDENTS TO GRADUATE WITHIN FOUR YEARS OR FIVE YEARS OR IN SOME CASES. HI THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION THANKS SENTARA- SO. RESEARCH TAKES AWHILE AND BUT WHEN WE STARTED THIS REJECTION DURING MOST THE TIME TO RESEARCH WAS DONE. WE DO NOT KNOW THE CODE- WOULD CHANGE THINGS QUITE A BIT- BUT IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK TO SEVERAL CAMPUSES ABOUT THIS AND ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT- ONLINE COURSES COULD BE HELP IN GETTING STUDENTS GRADUATE SOONER THAN ESPECIALLY TYING UP THE LAST QUESTION STUDENTS TO WORK A LOT OF ONLINE COURSES HAVE BECOME ASYNCHRONOUS COURSES WHICH MEANS STUDENTS CAN WORK ON THOSE BACKWARDS WORK WHEN THEY- ARE ABLE TO WORK ON IT SO THEY'RE NOT TIED TO A CERTAIN TIME THAT MAYBE DURING WORK HOURS- SO IT'S POSSIBLE. THAT IF ONLINE COURSES CONTINUE THIS COULD BE ONE WAY- THAT- COMBINING IT WITH OTHER THINGS- AND OTHER SUPPORTS THAT CAMPUS COULD HELP EASE THOSE BOTTLENECKS OR HELP STUDENTS GET THE COURSES THEY NEED WHEN. THEY NEED THEM. ABSOLUTELY OTHER FOR TO THE- OF A FUTURE REGION'S IN THIS AREA THANK YOU MISS. AT YOU CENTER ROT. DOT JACKSON THANK YOU THE PA POLICY INSTITUTE IS A MAY. READ TO ALL OF US- HAVE TO MAKE. AND PUT POLICY BECAUSE YOU PROVIDED. RESEARCH BATES- DAY. OF A OF- RESULTS AND GOOD PRACTICES AND WE SO APPRECIATE. THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE TO DIG DEEPER INTO THIS GRADUATION- TIME ISSUE WITH THE CSU WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORT WE THANK THE INSTITUTE FOR THEIR- INVESTMENT IN THIS TYPE OF VALUABLE- INFORMATION THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND FINALLY A FROM THE STORE IMPACT CENTER WE ARE EXCITED TO HAVE SIRI HOT NAY EASIER. WHO SERVES AS A DATA SCIENTIST AT THE IMPACT CENTER WHERE SHE WORKS ON DATA ANALYSIS VISUALIZATION AND MODELING. SHE IS PASSIONATE ABOUT USING DATA AS A TOOL TO TELL STORIES THAT REACH A WIDER AUDIENCE. PRIOR TO JOINING THE SORENSON TEAM SHE WORKED AS A DOCTOR IN INDIA. UPON MOVING TO THE UNITED STATES YOU WORK FOR THE UTAH AIDS FOUNDATION FILLING VARIOUS ROLES THERE- SHE GRADUATED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH. WITHIN M. S. INFORMATION SYSTEM SHE ALSO HOLDS A MASTER'S IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND A BACHELORS IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY FROM INDIA. AND THAT'S A OF A FASCINATING BACKGROUND TO- COME IN HERE AND SHARE SOME INSIGHTFUL THOUGHTS OF THAT. OUR STUDENT COMMUNITY- THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK AND SO WELCOME WE WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU CENTERS GAVE IT A ROUTE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION- LIKE YOU MENTIONED I'M SHE'S AND I I'M A MANAGER. IN SCIENCE OF THE SEVEN SEVEN INTO THE- OF UTAH. WE AN ACT APPLIED ACADEMIC DO SO INSTALLED SOCIAL. THROUGH THE USE OF AND INNOVATION. I'M PROMOTED TO YOUR MCCARTY AND I JUST HAS BEEN EXERTING THE FUTURE DID YOU GET. STARTING WITH PRODUCTION OF DEMO DRIVEN INTO JUST CLOSER BUT HE SAID AS LIKE THE LATE UNPAID. CHRIS NEED TO DRAW AND OTHER REBUILT ONE MARCH STOCK. THE OF HIGH EDUCATION. BUT MORE ATTENTION TO STATE AND THE- LEVEL DATA. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF FOCUS NOT TO BE THE DATE BUT ALSO THAT YOU CAN. THE STUDENTS. WE HAVE SOUGHT TO MATTER ONE TODAY AND- RECORDS AS CONTINUE EXPLORE A CHANGE HOW DID YOU. LAND LOOKS LIKE THIS TO AND BUT- TO. SINCE TWENTY NINE WE HAVE HELP MULTIPLE COULD BE AND KIND RESEARCH EXPERTS FROM NON. GOVERNMENT ACCREDITING BODIES YOUR BEST. SINCE THE ONSET OF COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE HAVE ALL FIFTY. THE I NEED TO BE. WITH THE COALITION OF. AND STUDENTS THE STATE. AND PRIVATE POST INSTEAD. AND SOME THE RESULT OF A VEHICLE SECOND STUDENTS WE CAN. I'M NOT GONNA SAY WITH WE CONSENT- WHAT ABOUT TO THE MEDIA FINANCIAL. CDC STUDY FOUND THAT ONE IN FOUR YOUNG ADULTS AGED EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR DESCRIBED CONSIDERING SUICIDE THIS SPRING. MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT IS CRUCIAL DURING THESE TIMES TO HELP STUDENTS SUCCEED IN THEIR CLASSES. I'M FOR UNIVERSITY CREATED AND USED TO DETERMINE PROGRAM TO HELP SUPPORT TO. THEY CONVERTED THEIR MENTAL ENTITY HEALTH SERVICES COMPLETE ONLINE DID YOU DID STUDENT. GOOD MORNING THINGS ONLINE IS NOT ALL THE NEXT SAID YOU. MANY OF THE THAT CALL IN CAN DON'T HAVE TO AN INTO CONNECTION. SO THE SPRING SEMESTER INSTEAD OF THE SYNC AND BE CONFERENCE PICKED. ISN'T THAT KNOWLEDGE HE CONDUCTED LEARNING TO AND MAIL BASE PACKET. HOUSING HAS ALSO BEEN ON THE MY YOU'D- MANY CAMP HAVE THAT IS HALLS BECAUSE OF CONFLICTS OF WITH OPENING WITHIN THE CAMPUSES. ONE SOLUTION BUT YOU OF. WEST INDIES THREE WHOLE TO DENSIFIED THAT IS INSTALLED. ABOUT 25% OF THE FIRST YEAR STUDENTS WILL LIVE IN THESE EACH OF WILL EACH OF THE WILL OPEN IN THE SAME WAY AS HOUSING- I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION. EXAMPLE OF TECHNICAL WE JUST OF OUR WORK GROUP TO THE FACTOR. AT THIS TIME PLEASE. WE HAVE A COMMUNITY STRATEGY FOR SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT THAT INCLUDES MUSIC COMMUNITY MEMBERS. PARKING LOTS WITH WIFI FOR STUDENTS WITH HIGHER EDUCATION NINETY TWO TWELVE. DRIVE BY CONTACT FREE PRINTER SERVICES AND THEN THREE OF US WERE HOUSING. THE COLLEGE TAKES A WHOLE COME APPROACH TO SEVEN. SO ACROSS THE HAVE ANXIETY ON QUALITY EDUCATION THE JOB MARKET COST AS WELL AS BASIC NEEDS SUCH AS FOOD AND HOUSING INSECURITY AND HOUSING SECURITY. INSTITUTIONS THAT CAN BEST SUPPORT THE STUDENTS AS THEY NAVIGATE THESE DIFFICULTIES ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO HAVE BETTER STUDENT OPENS. A GOOD STUDENT EXPERIENCE IS STRONGLY CORRELATED TO STUDENT SUCCESS STUDIES HAVE FOUND THE DISSATISFIED STUDENTS OFTEN ARE PART OF THAT INSTITUTION RESIDENTS ARE SATISFIED COLLEGES THE HIGHER RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATES LOWER LOAN DEFAULT RATES. AND INCREASED ALAMAT GIVING. BUT ALL STUDENTS NOT CREATE EQUAL THEY HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS. AND EXPAND UPON UNIVERSITIES LISTEN TO THEIR STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND THE DIVERSE NEEDS TO SUPPORT THEM. EFFECTS OF COVERT NINETEEN CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED IT DOES PUT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STRESS ON OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR SUPPORT SYSTEMS INCLUDING HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. WE MUST INSIST THAT INSTITUTIONS DO NOT FORGET THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LISTENING TO STUDENTS I TO COME UP WITH A STUDENT CENTRIC EQUITABLE SOLUTION TO BEST SUPPORT THE JOURNEY TO COLLEGE AND INTELLECTUALS. THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE APPRECIATE THE- BROADER PERSPECTIVE- THAT YEARS RESEARCH HAS. BROUGHT TO UNDERSTANDING HOW COLLEGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE TRYING TO. DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES I DO NOTE THAT. YOU KNOW THE ISSUE OF ONLINE DOT MENTAL HEALTH AND THAT THAT THE ACCESS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE IMPROVED THROUGH THE- YOU KNOW THE- ZIP SERVICES SUCH AS AMONG OTHERS WHERE THEY CAN CONNECT MORE EASILY TO- SOMEONE WHO CAN PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH CARE- AB BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE SOME. THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES FOR ACCESS THAT CREATES BARRIERS IN AND OUT IN ITS OWN RIGHT- DO YOU SEE SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT THE CO THAT ENVIRONMENT HAS DONE ACROSS THE COUNTRY- THE- IT. YUP CHANGES THAT MAY BE BUILT INTO THIS OUR SYSTEMS ARE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS GOING FORWARD ARE THERE. SOME THINGS THAT- PUTS THE- EVEN IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC THAT ARE ARE WORKING BETTER AND THAT WE SHOULD NOT THROW OUT- AS WE GET BACK TO WHAT WE HOPE WILL BE A MORE NORMAL- ENROLLMENT ENGAGEMENT WITH STUDENTS- YES. CHRISTIAN AND THE- ANSWERS THAT YOU GAVE I ACTUALLY. YEAH I MEAN SO THE ACCESS TO INTERNET BY THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR SHORT FOR THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE ACCESS IT'S DEFINITELY OPEN AFFECTS ABILITY- AND- DOCTOR JACKSON MENTIONED EARLIER THEY TAKE IT NEEDS IF YOU'RE A SYNCHRONOUS BOB YOU CAN WORK ON YOUR CLASSES IT AFFECTED WITH YOUR HOMEWORK I WAS ACTUALLY TAKING CARE OF IT OR TAKING CARE OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS- SO THAT DEFINITELY DOES ADDRESS SOME GAPS IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM- I ALSO THINK LAKE. FLEXIBILITY THAT STUDENTS NOW HAVE IN TERMS OF LIKE WHICH CLASSES THEY TAKE I AM AND HOW THE APPROACH THESE CLASSES I THINK IN SOME WAYS IT'S MADE IT EASIER FOR SURE SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT KIND. OF CONTENT FORWARD IN OUR SYSTEM. THANK YOU. CENTER ANYTHING ELSE BUT WE THING THIS WITNESS FOR TESTING. ONE QUESTION OF. SEVERAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THAT YOU FOUND THAT HAVE ROBUST- MEDICAL STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. WE WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE HOW THOSE PROGRAMS- ARE FUNDED FOR EXAMPLE DO ANY OF THOSE COLLEGE ANY NEW COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES OFFER- OR PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. TO STUDENTS. AT THE FRONT OF YOUR QUESTION ACTUALLY I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT ON SO I WILL LOOK AT IT AS FAR AS BECAUSE WE HAVE A DATABASE OF ALL OF THE- ALL OF THE KIND OF POLICIES THAT UNIVERSITIES ARE pTOOK OVER IT. AND MAKE A VERY ROBUST MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM LIKE ONE OF THEM BUT FONG WAS STANFORD BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DIG INTO WHAT THEY'RE HOW THEY'RE SUPPORTING THAT BUT I WILL LOOK INTO THATAND I CAN SEND YOU THE INFORMATION ACTUALLY. THE REASON I ASK THE QUESTION IS I BROUGHT THIS UP A COUPLE TIMES IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. OVERSIGHT YOU KNOW YOU UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS A HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT THEY AFFORD. ACTUALLY REQUIRES TO ENROLL IN OF THE STUDENTS STILL OTHERWISE HAVE. VIRTUALLY SAYS MY UNDERSTANDING. THE ISSUE DOES NOT AND I'M I'M WONDERING IF THE SYSTEM IS LARGEST SEE ISSUE- WITH THE BUYING POWER THE SYSTEM HAS COULD NEGOTIATE WITH THE HEALTH CARE. INSURERS TO. AT LEAST OFFER. INSURANCE PROGRAMS TO STUDENTS THAT INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE AT SOME LEVEL SO I DO HAVE AN INTEREST IN IT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO- DURING YOUR FURTHER RESEARCH TO COME UP WITH SOME FURTHER DATA I'D BE. INTERESTED IN AND- AND RECEIVING IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE TESTIMONY. THERE THANK THANK YOU SENATOR ROCK. MISS IN A YEAR THANK YOU FOR THAT AGAIN THE WORK THAT YOU ARE DOING WE WOULD WELCOME ANY ADDITIONAL- RESEARCH DATA THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE TO OUR COMMITTEE AS WE- WORK TOGETHER TO- TO IMPROVE AND TO DO. TO DO BEST BY OUR STUDENTS WHICH IS TO OUR MUTUAL GOAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC- OPEN. LISTENING TO OUR- OUR HEARING TODAY I WANT TO MAKE SURE I PROVIDE THEM WITH ANY OPPORTUNITY THEY WISH TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TO US- I WANNA FIRST INVITE ANYONE HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WISHES TO TESTIFY. ON HERE- THE GO TO ROOM ONE TWELVE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE THERE THAT IS- REMOTE THAT WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY I DON'T SEE ANYONE. LET ME ASK THE- THE MODERATOR WHO IS MONITORING THE PHONE LINES WITH THAT THERE IS ANYONE THAT AS- I INDICATED LIKE TO PROVIDE TEST MIGHT YOU COULD. YOU COULD ASK THEM NOW. I HAVE NO LINE. OKAY LET ME GIVE ONE LAST MOMENT TO. SEE IF ANYONE WANTS TO CALL AND TO PROVIDE THAT TESTIMONY WE CERTAINLY WANT TO HEAR IT. AND WE ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO RECEIVE ANY KIND OF WRITTEN TESTIMONY. AT THE CONCLUSION OF OUR HEARING. OPERATOR ANY CHANGES THERE. I HAVE NO COMMENTS OVER THE PHONE AT THE TIME OKAY. LET ME- LET ME WRAP UP AND SAY FIRST THANK YOU TO OUR MY WONDERFUL STAFF. SUCKS YOU WHAT WELL YEAH AND STEVE HARMAN AND OTHERS WHO THAT THE TECHNICAL STAFF HERE THAT HAVE HELPED MAKE THIS HEARING POSSIBLE. THANK YOU TO SENATOR ROTH FOR ALL YOUR LEADERSHIP IN EDUCATION AND CERTAINLY IN HIGHER EDUCATION- IF YOU ARE A LEADER THAT I. CONTINUE TO LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING- AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO. IMPROVE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND ENSURE THAT IT HAS THE RESOURCES IT NEEDS TO- TO THRIVE- I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TODAY- I'M I'M APPRECIATIVE OF EVERYONE- WHO WAS BROUGHT THE IMPORTANT. INSIGHT AND DATA TO THE TABLE I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE PULLING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- WE KNOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS TO. ACHIEVE THEIR THEIR ALL THEIR GOALS AND FOR MANY IT'S GRADUATING IN FOUR YEARS. HOW THEY CAN SAVE MONEY AND TO THE WORK FORCE SOONER IN THEIR CHOSEN FIELD AND INSPIRE. OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS TO DO THE SAME. ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING- FACTS THAT WE HEAR EVERY YEAR YEAH IN THIS CASE- OVER A HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND BACCALAUREATE DEGREES WERE AWARDED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY- THIS PAST YEAR. AND OVER 50% WERE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO GRADUATE WHAT AN AMAZING. AN AMAZING LADDER OF ECONOMIC. SUCCESS HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS THAT SO INSPIRING AND SO. AS WE ENSURE THAT STUDENTS CAN CAN ACHIEVE THAT THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO THEIR BROTHERS AND THEIR SISTERS- AND- ALLOWS THOSE FAMILIES TO HAVE- THEIR DREAMS THAT. ACTUALLY CREATED AND FULFILLED- GOING FORWARD- AND WE KNOW FROM THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD TODAY THAT- THAT THE LONGER STUDENTS STAYS IN. SCHOOL THE LESS LIKELY THEY ARE TO GRADUATE. AND IF THEY CAN STILL OFF STRONG AND TAKE THOSE FIFTEEN UNITS AT THE BEGINNING THAT IT INCREASES THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS SO MUCH. MORE SO IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO INSURE STUDENTS CAN MAKE PROGRESS. TOWARDS A DEGREE- THAT THAT DAY IN SOME WAYS WE'RE TRYING TO SHIFT BACK TO- THE TRADITIONAL FOR YOUR MODEL IT BECAME A LITTLE. COMFORTABLE FOR PEOPLE TO SAY WELL SIX YEARS IS OKAY OR MORE- BUT WE KNOW AS WE HEAR FROM THE SURVEY DATA THAT STUDENTS WANT TO GET THROUGH AND FOR THAT TRADITIONAL MODEL SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO. RE ESTABLISH AND- MAKE IT BE THE NORM AGAIN- AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING. TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT THE SYSTEM HAS SET. 40% GRADUATION BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS THAT INCOMING CLASS IN LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS THAT'S GOING TO DETERMINE OUR SUCCESS IN THAT REGARD. SO A LOT OF GOOD PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF GOOD PROGRESS- IN TERMS OF THE- GRADUATION TO GET CLOSER TO THAT NUMBER- BUT WE DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TIME LEFT TO. TO DO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. TO MAKE THAT GOAL ACHIEVABLE- AND SO. FOR THAT REASON I KNOW BY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO- AT PARTNER- WITH THE SYSTEM WITH THE FACULTY WITH THE ADMINISTRATORS- WITH THE CHANCELLOR AND IT IS WONDERFUL TEAM. TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE CAN MAKE THAT GOAL A REALITY AND HAVE BEEN BEEN VERY SHORT TIME. SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU ALL FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE STUDENTS SELECT COMMITTEE. ON STUDENT SUCCESS. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED WORK TOGETHER- IN THE COMING YEAR. AND WITH THAT- THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED.
