A FEW MONTHS BUT- WE STILL HAVE SOME PRIORITY SOME PRIORITIES THAT WE'RE HOPING TO WORK ON BEFORE WE FINALIZE THE BUDGET- FRANKLY RELATED TO ACCESS AFFORDABILITY ALWAYS- PRIORITIES OF THIS- OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY. WE DO HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF- ONE TIME MONEY IN THE BUDGET SO WE'RE THINKING OF WAYS TO. TO BE A CREATIVE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO- OFF CAMPUS CENTERS SO. TO THE UC AND CSU FOLKS I KNOW YOU ALWAYS HAVE A SHINY NEW SCIENCE BUILDING YOU WANT US TO REHAB BUT WE WANT TO. WE WANT YOU TO THINK DIFFERENTLY AND- TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN. WORK ON EXPANDING ACCESS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. SOME OF OUR OUR TOP CAMPUSES ARE IMPACTED AND WE PROBABLY CAN'T BUILD NEW UC'S AND SEE ISSUES BUT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW SOME OF. OUR EXISTING CAMPUS BUT ALSO SOME OF THESE OFF CAMPUS CENTRES NOT FINALLY A PRIORITY FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AND I. IS TO ADDRESS FINANCIAL AID. AND ARE CALGRANT PROGRAMS- WE KNOW THAT IS THE ENVY OF THE NATION ARE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS BUT WE STILL LEAVE TOO MANY- BEHIND- AS WELL AS DON'T PROVIDE ENOUGH FINANCIAL AID TO K. FOR TO COVER THE NON. TUITION COSTS AND THIS IS NOT JUST CAL GRANT BUT AS- A COLLEAGUE THIS EDUCATION SHARE STORDAHL NOTES TO- THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AS WELL TO HELP. OUR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING SO THAT THOSE ARE TWO OF THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS PRIORITIES THAT YOU'LL SEE US ZERO IN ON IN ADDITION TO WHAT'S IN THE- GOVERNOR'S ON THE REVISED- WE DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC. TO PARTICIPATE TODAY EITHER IN THE ROOM FOR THROUGH- THE TELEPHONE. PARTICIPATION WHICH IS ON THE AGENDA AND I WERE ON OUR WEBSITE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER. I WILL READ IT RIGHT HERE. AGAIN ONE EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SO. ONE EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. ACCESS CODE. OKAY SO WITH THAT SO WE WILL BEGIN WITH- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THEIR- MAY REVISED PROPOSALS. AND WE'LL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. M. L. A. L. IN AND FROM THE C. HOUSE BEFORE STARK WE TAKE ROLE REAL QUICK MISTER MARTIN. REYES HERE MCCARTY HERE. BUT ALL. RIGHT ARE. FOR THE DEVIL OKAY THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ARE THESE TWO THINGS ARE YES THERE'S WITH B. RIGHT MY COLLEAGUES WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF THIS MORNING AT AND THEN QUICKLY DETAIL WE HAVE A LOT OF PROPOSALS AND WE KNOW WE WANT TO GET TO THE QUESTION ANSWER PORTIONS. SO FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FOR PROPOSING A AT SIXTY NINE POINT THREE MILLION ONGOING BASED INCREASE THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY BE A 2% AUGMENTATION IN ADDITION 23% PROPOSED IT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT'S ALSO IN ADDITION TO THE THREE HUNDRED AND TWO POINT FOUR MILLION. THAT THE EARLY FEBRUARY EARLY ACTION AGREEMENT- WOULD ADD TO RESTORE THE TWENTY TWENTY- CALYXT SO. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ONE TIME INVESTMENTS DO YOU SEE BUDGET. THERE'S A FIFTY MILLION. FEDERAL FUNDS FROM ARPA FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT'S IN ADDITION TO A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE. MILLION GENERAL FUND FROM GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS FORTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME. FOR UC DAVIS PROGRAMS. FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME THE UCLA LABOR CENTER SPECIFICALLY FOR THE LOSS AND THEY WERE CENTERS FOR STILL NEEDS RENOVATIONS. TEN POINT TWO MILLION FOR USE NEAR SF DYSLEXIA CENTER. FIVE MILLION FOR THE UCLA ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES CENTER AND ONE MILLION FOR THE BERKELEY ALTERNATIVE MEATS LAW AB- THE OTHER BIG ONE TIME. PROPOSAL IS- ONE BILLION GENERAL FUND THAT SPLIT OVER TWO YEARS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION BUDGET YEAR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AN INTERVIEW TO TWENTY THREE THAT'S FOR A LEARNING ALIGNED EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM. THAT CREATES AN ENDOWMENT ADMINISTERED BY THE UC AND THE AND THE ANNUAL RETURNS WOULD BE ALLOCATED BASED ON TOTAL PROPORTION OF THE THREE SEGMENTS. AND BASICALLY AT THE C. C. C. C. S. U. N. USED EIGHTY ODD STUDENTS WOULD RECEIVE A STATE FUNDED WORK STUDY A SUPPORT PROGRAM AND THAT PROGRAM WOULD FOCUS ON UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED BACKGROUND. LOW INCOME FOSTER YOUTH HOMELESS YOUTH. AND SPECIFICALLY PRIORITIZE STEM MAJORS THE IDEA IS THAT THE STATE FUNDED VERSION OF FEDERAL WORK STUDY ONE JUST PROVIDE AN HOURLY WAGE WOULD ALSO SUPPORT LONG TERM CAREER DEVELOPMENT BY LINKING THE JOB TO YOUR YOUR ACADEMIC PROGRAM. WELL THE LAST THE PROPOSAL FOR YOU SEE IS TO ELIMINATE THE USE YOUR PUPPY A. N. R. AND YOU SEE PATH LINE ITEM AND TO CONSOLIDATE THAT BACK WITH THE MAIN. LINE ITEM WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING TO WHO. ARE PROVISIONS THAT WOULD ENSURE TE TRANSPARENCY AND LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS THAT THE SEPARATE LINE ITEM ALLOWED FOR- WE'RE TRYING TO PRESERVE THAT WITH THE PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE- AND I AM HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY THANK YOU L. L. CONSEJERO DELEGADO A GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE- BEFORE I DIVE INTO THE UC ITEMS I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON A THEME THAT YOU'LL JURISTIC- NOTE THROUGHOUT THE HEARING TODAY AND THAT IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SUBMITTED A LOT OF PROPOSALS TO LEGISLATURES ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT AGENCIES. BUT IN MANY CASES THERE IS- IT'S PROVIDED LITTLE INFORMATION ON THESE PROPOSALS. AND EVEN MORE INFORMATION EXISTS OF MUCH OF THE INFORMATION IS PRELIMINARY OR INCOMPLETE. I DON'T KNOW MOSTLY THINK THERE ARE MANY PROPOSALS WHERE- YOU COULD START MAKING DECISIONS ARE WEIGHING YOUR OPTIONS- WITHOUT MUCH MORE INFORMATION. EITHER BECAUSE THE PRO PROPOSALS HAVE MERIT OR- THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH MERIT YOU COULD CONSIDER REJECTING THEM OR YOU COULD CONSIDER SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY RATES. THEN THERE ARE THE PROPOSAL'S WHERE WE THINK THAT YOU COULD BE REASONABLE CONCEPT BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET MORE INFORMATION BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS. AND IF YOU LOOK THROUGH THE UC PACKAGE WE THINK THAT THEY'RE A MIX OF THOSE EXACT KIND OF PROPOSALS- INTERVIEW SHE ITEM HERE- FOR THE SAKE OF TIME I'M GOING TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON FOUR KEY ISSUES. I DON'T GO IN ORDER AS YOU SEE THEM HERE ON THE AGENDA. SORTING ON PAGE THREE OF THE FIRST ISSUE I WANT TO TOUCH ON IS BASE SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AGAIN AS THE ADMINISTRATION NOTED THERE ARE THEY ARE PROPOSING TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL 2% BASED INCREASED YOU SEE LIKE IT'S THEIR TOTAL BASE INCREASE TO FIVE PERCENT. AND THAT'S ON TOP OF RESTORATION FUNDS THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED TO YOU SEE. I'M UNDER THE FEBRUARY GREEN ONES. OVERALL WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE. ON SOME BASIS ADDITIONAL BASE SUPPORT YOU SEE ABOVE RESTORATION. YOU SEE FACES COST PRESSURES EVER YOU HEARD THIS YOU'RE CERTAINLY A DIFFERENCE- IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF THE SUPPORT WE THINK A REASONABLE STARTING POINT. A COULD BE SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S- A LITTLE OVER TWO PERCENT. WOULD COVER OF THE SORT OF BASIC ESSENTIALS IT WOULD COVER- PLATE THAT EFFECT COST INCREASES. DEBT SERVICE FOR EXAMPLE. ON THE LEGISLATURE COULD CAN PROVIDE. FUNDING ABOVE THAT- FOR EXAMPLE BY ADOPTING THE PROPOSED 3% FROM JANUARY OR 5% OF THE REVISION. PROVIDING A LARGER BASE INCREASE WITH ANOTHER YOU SEE PRIORITIES FOR EXAMPLE EMPLOYEE SALARY INCREASES- IT WOULD ENHANCE STUDENT SERVICES. ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY WOULD HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO WEIGH THOSE PRIORITIES SO IF THERE ARE ANY PARTICULAR PRIORITIES THE LEGISLATURE. I WANT TO ENSURE YOU SEE SUPPORTING IT WE RECOMMEND SPECIFYING THAT THE BUDGET ACT. SURE WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THAT SECOND ISSUE THAT'S ON PAGE THREE WHICH IS LEARNING ALIGNED STUDENT FINANCE. ARE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS OF THIS PROPOSAL- ONE CONCERN WE HAVE IS WITH THE PROPOSED FUNDING APPROACH. WHICH WERE INVEST THE PROPOSED FUNDS- ANY USING DOMINANCE. ANNADEL MONTHS- INVEST FUNDS IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ASSETS INCLUDING EQUITIES. THAT MAKES THEM SUBJECT TO MORE RISK AND MORE VOLATILITY OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THE PROPOSAL WOULD- FUNDED THESE NEW STUDENT EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. ARE FROM THE ON GOING PROCEEDS FROM THESE INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES. AND AS SUCH MAY BE SUBJECT TO SOME VOLATILITY. WE THINK THAT WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR BOTH CAMPUSES AND STUDENTS THE PLAN FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR. THE PROPOSAL ALSO RAISES A NUMBER OF OUR KEY QUESTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WHAT THE ROLE WOULD BE OF EMPLOYERS AND SUPPORTING THESE OPPOSITION ROBERT KENNEDY'S- ALONG WITH THE STATE. BECAUSE THESE QUESTIONS ARE SO FUNDAMENTAL IN THIS PROPOSALS COMING- SO LATE IN THE PROCESS WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL. SURE I WANTEDTO TOUCH ON ARE THESE MANY OTHER ONE TIME PROPOSALS THAT UC'S STARTING ON PAGE THREE AND CONTINUING ON THE PAGE FOR. ALL THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO FIND- MANY DIFFERENT PRIORITIES ARE FOR EXAMPLE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. OUR RESEARCH ON- NEW WAYS TO ENGAGE AT FIRST DIDN'T HAVE MIGHT HAVE THE SPECS YEAH. OUR RESEARCH ON ALTERNATIVE NEEDS OUTRAGED ANIMAL SHELTERS. THE RESTRICTIONS ARE PRO- IN ALLOWS STATE TO COVER MANY DIFFERENT PRIORITIES. BUT ALSO SPREAD RESOURCES THIN ACROSS ALL THE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES AND POTENTIALLY UNDERMINES THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS ANY OF THEM. I DON'T ALTERNATIVE APPROACH LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER HERE IS TO BE MORE STRATEGIC AND FOCUS ON A FEW KEY PRIORITIES PARTICULARLY PRIORITIES THAT HAVE A CERTAIN- STATE BENEFITS. OF FOR EXAMPLE AND YOU'VE YOU'VE HEARD US MENTION THIS A LOT SO I WON'T- WHAT KIND OF THIS TOO MUCH BUT WE THINK DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF A OF A PRIORITY THAT PROVIDES CERTAIN BENEFITS TO THE STATE. IT AND COVERS PROJECTS THAT WITH INCREASING COSTS IN FUTURE YEARS HELPS ADDRESS A BUDGET RESILIENCY FOR BOTH YOU SEE AND THE STATE'S. AND IN THE FINAL PROPOSAL I WANT TO TOUCH ON IS OUR LOW SECOND THE LAST ONE THERE ON PAGE FOUR WHICH IS FOR OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT LINE ITEM. NOW YOU SEE- HISTORICALLY HAS HAD THE ABILITY TO FIND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. ALL BUT A FEW YEARS AGO THE STATE CREATED A LINE ITEM SPECIFICALLY FOR THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT WITH THE INTENTION OF ENHANCING OVERSIGHT OVER THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET AND ALSO- INSERTING MORE CONTROL OVER ITS OPERATIONS. THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW PROPOSING TO RETURN TO THAT PREVIOUS SYSTEM AND GIVING YOU SEE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES. WE ARE CERTAIN ADVANTAGES TO PRESERVING THE LINE ITEM OF FOR WHEN WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO TARGET FUNDING DIFFERENTLY TO CAMPUS IT WAS WORTH AS THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT. THERE ARE SOME COST PRESSURES THAT ARE SHARED BOTH BY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IN CAMPUSES FOR EXAMPLE COMPENSATION INCREASES. BUT THERE ALSO ARE SOME DIFFERENT COST PRESSURES FOR EXAMPLE ENROLLMENT GROWTH STUDENT SERVICES THESE TEND TO BE MORE CONCENTRATED ON THE CAMPUSES. WE ALSO THINK IT ARE PRESERVING THE LINE ITEM ENHANCES TRANSPARENCY THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING. ADDITIONAL REPORTING WE THINK THAT RECORDING MAKES SENSE WE RECOMMEND YOU ADOPT THE REPORTS. FOR IT LINE ITEM OF PRESERVES EVEN ADDITIONAL. AND THAT IT CLARIFIES THE AMOUNT OF STATE THAT'S GOING FOR THIS PARTIES. SO WE DON'T RECKON AGAINST ELIMINATING A LINE ITEM WOULD YOU RECOMMEND ONE MODIFICATION WHICH IS THAT IN THE LINE ITEM THERE IS A CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROGRAM LOOK FOR JOBS YOU SEE CALF IT'S A PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN HURT BY THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE. EACH PARTICULAR PROGRAM WE THINK THAT IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO RETURN THE FUNDS OF THE CAMPUSES AND HAVE A PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY A ON ASSESSMENT A CHARGE ON THE CAMPUSES. WE THINK THAT WOULD LEND IT STARTED GREATER EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF THE PROGRAM- OF TIME ALL MY COMMENTS THERE BUT I HAPPY TO ELABORATE ON THESE ISSUES DURING THE- DAY. OKAY THANK YOU THE UNIVERSITY RESPONSE. YOUR PRESENTATION WITH. GOOD MORNING CARE MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M SAY EVER TENANTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WON'T COMMENT ON ALL OF THE ITEMS. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA APPRECIATES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING A 5% BASED BUDGET INCREASE THE UC OPERATING BUDGET IN ADDITION TO THE FULL BASED BUDGET RESTORATION THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE CREATURE IN FEBRUARY. YOU SEE CONTINUES TO REQUEST HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION AN ONGOING FUNDING AND THIRTY MILLION AND ONE TIME OPERATIONAL INVESTMENTS IN ADDITION TO THE MAY BE VICE. ARE YOU SEE REGION'S REQUESTED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION TO SUSTAIN CAMPUS OPERATIONS AND PROVIDE POLICY COVERED STAFF AND FACULTY. A 3% SALARY ADJUSTMENT. WE CONTINUE TO REQUEST EIGHTY THREE MILLION IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO MEET THESE GOALS FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. OUR DESIRE TO PROVIDE A SALARY ADJUSTMENTS ARE POLICY COVERED STAFF IS DRIVEN BY WANTING SALARIES TO KEEP UP WITH INFLATION. UC CAMPUSES CONTRIBUTE GREATLY TO THEIR LOCAL ECONOMIES AND IS THE THIRD LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE IT IS IMPORTANT WE ENSURE THE WELLBEING OF OUR EMPLOYEES. YOU SEE COULD HAVE USED TO REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE TARGETED INVESTMENTS IN OUR STUDENTS INCLUDING THIRTY MILLION AN ONGOING FUNDING. TO BEGIN CLOSING GRADUATION EQUITY GAPS ALONG WITH MORE TIME TO ACHIEVE THE RESULTS. THIS INCREASES THROUGHPUT OF STUDENTS AND A LOT OF STUDENT ROLE LARGER INCOMING UNDERGRADUATE COHORTS. AND FORTY THREE MILLION AN ONGOING INVESTMENT IN BONNER PULL STUDENTS INCLUDING EXPANSION OF THE SUCCESSFUL SAVE A PROGRAM THAT PREPARES UNDERSERVED. STUDENTS FOR UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. FOR TIME ABOUT WE REQUEST THIRTY MIL TO ADVANCE REPATRIATION OF PROBABLE REMAINS OUR STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH TELEHEALTH CAPABILITIES AND ONGOING TRAINING. WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PROPOSED INVESTMENT OF THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION TOWARDS UC'S DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ENERGY PROJECT. IN ADDITION THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE YOU SEE HAS BILLIONS AND SEISMIC RENOVATION NEEDS AND BUILDING UPGRADES. WE SUBMITTED A ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR LIST OF THESE PROJECTS ARE GOVERNOR IF THE COMMITTEE HAS AVAILABLE FUNDING ALLOCATE TOWARDS THESE PURPOSES. THE MAYOR REVISION DIRECTS YOU SEE TO MEDICAL LEARNING ALIGNED INDICTMENT FOR THE STATE. THE PROPOSED OR POSSIBLE TO CREATE A STATE FUNDED LEARNING ALIGNED EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM WOULD HELP INCENTIVIZE MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR STUDENTS. THE FIRST PART OF CREATING A DEBT FREE PATH IS MORE FINANCIAL AID BUT THE SECOND PART IS CREATING MEANINGFUL MEANINGFUL WORK FOR STUDENTS TO SATISFY THE WORK STUDY COMPONENT OF ANY FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE. YOU SEE HAS A PROCESS IN PLACE FOR MANAGING AFFILIATED ENDOWMENTS. BECAUSE ALL THE GOVERNMENT EARNINGS ARE PAID OUT AT THE END OF JUNE EACH YEAR THE FIRST PAYMENT TO CAMPUSES WILL TAKE PLACE IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I DO WANT TO EXPRESS A CAUTION THAT THE STOCK MARKET CAN LOSE VALUE MEANING THAT THEY INVESTED IN GOVERNMENT PRINCIPLE AND DECREASE IN VALUE TO THE DOCTORS OUTSIDE OF UC'S CONTROL. DURING THE YEARS WHEN THE INVESTMENT VALUE TO CLIENTS THE PAYOUT THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD ALSO DECLINE. AND FINALLY BEGIN OVERSEE OF CALIFORNIA APPRECIATES THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZING THE DIFFICULTIES BALK UC OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT OF USING A LINE ITEM APPROPRIATION FOR THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS THE CHANGING FUNDING METHODOLOGY ONLY. IT DOES NOT RESULT IN MORE FUNDING TO USE YOUR P. AT THE EXTENSIVE BUDGET REFORMS USE THE UNDER TALKED TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE STATE CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILL STAY IN PLACE. THE PROPOSAL WILL ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS LACK OF FLEXIBILITY WITH THE LINE ITEM CREATED FOR EXAMPLE THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT DIRECT LINE ITEM RESULTED IN THE UC HOPE YOU BUDGET BEING FLAT OR DECREASING SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN. THIS LACK OF FLEXIBILITY AND ABILITY TO RESPOND QUICKLY WAS HIGHLIGHTED DURING THE PANDEMIC. FOR EXAMPLE BUT HOSPITALS OPERATING IN CRISIS MODE THERE WAS NEED FOR SYSTEM WIDE CHIEF CLINICAL OFFICER RECORDED MEDICAL RESPONSE TESTING AND VACCINATION. IN ORDER TO HIRE DISPOSITION YOU SEE WHAT WE HAD TO TERMINATE OTHER EMPLOYEES YOU'RE FREE UP THE FUNDS FOR THE CRITICAL FUNCTION. THE SLOW% DOWN HIRING BY MONTHS AND MEANT THE LOSS OF EMPLOYEES CONDUCTED OTHER WORK FOR THE SYSTEM. U. ZERO P. COULD NOT USE FEDERAL STIMULUSFUNDS FOR THIS EMERGENCY BECAUSE AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM WE COULD NOT RECEIVE THESE FUNDS FROM THE CAMPUS AS- TRANSITIONING TO A NEW FUNDING METHODOLOGY WILL ALLEVIATE THESE PROBLEMS BUT THE LONG LIST OF IMPLEMENTED REFORMS WILL STAY IN PLACE. EXECUTIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF CHANCELLORS VICE CHANCELLORS OF FINANCE AND OTHER CAMPUS LEADERS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE PRESIDENT I USED TO BE PROGRAMS EXPENDITURES. WILL CONTINUE PROVIDING CAMPUS. INPUT TO USE YOUR P. FINANCES. THANK REPORT. THAT WILL STAND IN YOUR OKAY RESERVE THAT MOST OF AND DOC. YOU SEE OP RESERVES ARE NOT REPORTED QUARTERLY TO THE UC REGENTS ALONG WITH BUDGET AMOUNTS TO ACTUAL EXPENDITURES. THESE PUBLIC QUARTERLY PRESENTATIONS WILL CONTINUE UNCHANGED. YOU SEE OKAY UNLIMITED AN ENTIRE NEW BUDGET AND PLANNING SYSTEM. ORACLE CROP CLOUD FINANCIAL SYSTEM PROVIDES YOU SEE OP WITH THE GENERAL LEDGER ALLOWS TRACKING OF PLANNED BUDGETS AND ACTUAL EXPENDITURES WITH FAR GREATER EASE. USING THIS ENHANCED TRACKING SYSTEM YOU SEE OKAY NOW USES ACTUAL EXPENDITURES AND FORECASTING. PROVIDING GREATER ACCURACY THESE REPORTS WILL STAY EVEN. AS A DIFFERENT FUNDING METHODOLOGIES ABOUT THAT. I HELPFUL THAT WORK ON INCLUDED. REVIEW EACH YOU SEE OKAY FUND AND USE. THERE ALSO WAS AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS TO DOCUMENT EACH PROGRAM AN INITIATIVE AND PROVIDE CLEAR DEFINITIONS OF EACH. AMONG THE CHANGES FROM THE LINE ITEM WAS THE ELIMINATION OF UC OKAY UNALLOCATED RESERVES. OVER HUNDRED SIXTY SIX MILLION HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY UC OAKLEY THE CAMPUSES LEAVING USED TO HELP YOU WITH THAT UNALLOCATED RESERVE OF ZERO BY JUNE TWENTY NINETEEN. THIS DID CAUSE DIFFICULTIES IN RESPONDING TO THE PANDEMIC WOULD USE YOUR P. COULD NOT BE NIMBLE IN RESPONDING TO THE APPALLING CAMPUS NEEDS. THESE REFORMS MEANS THAT YOU STILL BE BUDGET TODAY IS NOT TO USE YOUR BE BUDGET OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. TRANSPARENCY DOCUMENTATION AND DECISION MAKING HAVE ALL CHANGED THESE IMPORTANT CHANGES WILL REMAIN EVEN AS THE FUNDING MECHANISM CHANGES. I ASK THAT YOU APPROVED THE CHANGE THAT. YOU USE YOUR P. FUNDING METHODOLOGY. AND IN CLOSING I WANT TO SAY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED FOR TAR ONE AND- YOU SEE AN I'M AVAIL. I THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU BUT AND NOW WILL HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. YOU START OFF FOR MANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER MEDINA. WELL I ALSO WANT TO JOIN IN AND- EXPRESSING- MY HAPPINESS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR AND HIGHER EDUCATION AND UC- I WAS VERY- GLAD TO SEE ALLOCATION IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THE LABOR CENTER IN- LOS ANGELES IN DOWNTOWN LA- IN CONJUNCTION WITH UCLA. I THINK THE ROLE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE COMMUNITY IS AN IMPORTANT ROLE AND PART OF THAT ROLE IS THE RESEARCH THAT IS DONE BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND IN THAT LIGHT I WANNA EXPRESS THAT I VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE TO SEE A THREE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION TO THE UCLA LATINO POLICY AND POLITICS INITIATIVE WHICH IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- LATINO POLICY AND POLITICS INITIATIVE AND THE WORK THAT THEY ARE DOING AT UCLA IS IMPORTANT WORK. OF WORK THAT IT IS- SUPPORTED AND DEEM- IMPORTANT BY THE LATINO CAUCUS I HAVEN'T OF IN FRONT OF ME A LETTER SIGNED BY OUR CHAIR MY DEAL AND IT WOULD ALSO AND THE VICE CHAIR OF THE LATINO CAUCUS ROBERT RIVAS- THEY'VE THEY'VE BEEN DOING. GREAT WORK AND- IT IS A SENSE THAT THEY BE GIVEN THE- THREE MILLION. TO TO CONTINUE THE WORK THEY'RE DOING. SO JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS THAT AND HOPE TO SEE THAT IN THE IN THE FINAL BUT- OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MR MEDINA. SOME ARRESTS THANK YOU MISTER DO WANT TO JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM RIVERSIDE THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT- TOPIC AT THE UCLA LATINO POLICY AND POLITICS POLITICS INITIATIVE HAS RECEIVED FUNDING IN THE PAST IT WAS PROVIDED EXCELLENT- POLICY REPORTS- IT IT IT WITH THAT THE REQUEST NOW IS TO HAVE THIS FUNDED ANNUALLY- THREE MILLION DOLLAR- AMOUNT AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO REQUESTED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- THE POLICIES OF THAT THAT THEY HAVE DEALT WITH- ON CRITICAL ISSUES THAT AFFECT THE LATINO COMMUNITY SUCH AS- COVERED NINETEEN HEALTH. EDUCATION VOTING RIGHTS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LABOR AND SO MUCH MORE SO I JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN MAKING THAT SPECIFIC REQUEST WHICH WAS INCLUDED LAST TIME AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED THIS TIME AND ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU THANK. I WANT TO FOCUS ON- SOME OTHER LARGER YOU SEE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO US SO WE HAVE SENSUALLY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE MILLION I'M GOING HERE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO FOCUS ON UC'S PRIORITIES BUT- THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY THE STATE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES AS FAR AS ENROLLMENT GROWTH- MAY SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD BUT THAT'S THE ONE ISSUE WE HEAR MOST WE GO BACK HOME TO OUR COMMUNITIES. IS ACCESS TO THE TO THE YOU SEE SO YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY- MISTER MEDINA WHAT IS IT THREE MILLION FOR THE REQUEST FOR LATINO CENTER POTENTIALLY WE COULD TAKE OUT OF THE EARMARKED FOR THE UC AND FOCUSED ON OUR PRIORITIES AS WELL AS ISSUES LIKE ENROLLMENT GROW SO WHY WOULD WHY WOULD WE AS A LEGISLATURE FULLY FIND THIS- BLANK CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE MILLION WITHOUT HAVING ANY COMMITMENT FOR EXPANDING ENROLLMENT AND WHAT IS THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH TARGET THAT- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA- IS. IS- IT IS LOOKING TO- PROMOTES WITH THIS INCREASE LET ME LET ME FIRST ASK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THIS QUESTION- BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU SEE ANSWER ME VERY UNSATISFACTORY- MISTER PARTNER FINANCE- WHY. DO WE NOT HAVE A ROMAN TARGET. WITH THE MONIES THAT YOU PROPOSE IN THE IN THE BUDGET. THE QUESTION SURE MCCARTY. SO THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION DOES NOT SPECIFY ENROLLMENT TARGETS AS YOU MENTIONED FOR EITHER UC OR CSU. WE RECOGNIZE THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENT ROLE MEANT AT BOTH UC AND CSU OUR PROPERTY FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND WE'RE OPEN TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS. OKAY SO UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WITH WITH YOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE PROPOSED MILLION DOLLAR- ALLOCATION. WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR- THOUGHTS FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS ARE WE NEED THAT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO PAY FOR OUR BASED COST INCREASES ON OUR CAMPUS AS IT WILL GO TOWARDS THINGS LIKE COVERING A RETIREMENT. AND HEALTH CARE COST INCREASES THAT WILL GO TOWARDS. PARENTS IT'LL GO TO PROVIDING SALARY INCREASES ESPECIALLY FOR OUR LOWEST PAID EMPLOYEES THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD START- IT'LL GO TOWARD BOND- FINANCING COST INCREASES SO ARTIFACT FUNDING WE DONT HAVE AVAILABLE FUNDING TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT- WE ARE ABLE TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT IF YOU WERE TO PROVIDE US WITH. FULL MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION FOR NEW STUDENTS WE WOULD REQUEST- THE FULL MARGINAL COST AND WE CAN ENROLL MORE STUDENTS. THANK YOU. SO THE- CAN YOU GO OVER THE THEIR MARGINAL COST REQUEST AGAIN. THAT CERTAINLY SO FOR EACH OF STATE SUPPORTED STUDENT WE HAVE AN ESTIMATED COST OF HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO EDUCATE THAT STUDENT- THE STUDENTS TUITION AND FEES COVER A PORTION OF THAT AND THEN WE REQUEST THE STATE COVERED THE REMAINING PORTION OF. THOSE FUNDS ARE USED TO HIRE FACULTY AND OF STUDENTS SUPPORT SERVICES STAFF OR THE CAMPUSES. ARTICULATE THE MARGINAL COST FOR CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES IS TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX DOLLARS. YES SO YOU'RE SAYING WE UNDERSTAND THE MARGINAL COST IS ROUGHLY TEN THOUSAND PER STUDENT YOU'RE SAYING. IF THERE IF THERE WAS ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY ABOVE THE ONE SEVENTY THREE MILLION FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH AT TEN THOUSAND PER STUDENT. YOU WOULD FOCUS ON ENROLLMENT GROWTH. THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT SIR WE CAN INCREASE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ENROLLMENT FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE IF YOU'LL GIVE US ADDITIONAL FUNDING YEAH AT THE MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION FOR STUDENTS GAS AND ALL I SAY IS THAT THAT THAT THIS WEEKEND. WHEN I GO TO THE MY LITTLE LEAGUE GAME WHEN MR- GALLAGHER GOES TO THAT TO THAT FARM WHATEVER YOU HAVE UP THERE AND- IN YUBA COUNTY WITH MR- THE DONALD GOES TO THE LONG BEACH GRAND PRIX AND YOU GO TO THAT TINY TOTS PROGRAM IN- VALENCIA YOU MISTER MEDINA GOES TO UC RIVERSIDE YOU GO TO SOME TAX SOMETHING RATHER IN. SILICON VALLEY IN THIS RACE GOES TO THE DESK- THESE FARMERS MARKET IN DOWNTOWN SAN BERNARDINO OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE GONNA SAY YOU HAVE GIVEN US THE YOU DON'T HAVE ONE NEW SLOT FOR OUR CALIFORNIA KIDS TO GO TO UNIVERSITY. AND WE'RE GIVING YOU TWO HUNDRED MILLION DLLARS IN NEW MONEY TO FOCUS ROUGHLY. ONE SEVENTY THREE TO YOUR PRIORITIES. FORGIVING HUNDRED OF MILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE GRANTS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND THERE'S A BIG LAUNDRY LIST OF STUFF THAT YOU DEEM IMPORTANT FOR THE UNIVERSITY BUT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE SAYING NOW. THAT'S NOT OUR PRIORITY SO THIS IS. A UNACCEPTABLE. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A CLEAR CUT. ENROLLMENT TARGET WITH EXISTING MONEY I KNOW YOU ALWAYS WANT MORE AND MORE AND MORE BUT THESE ARE THESE ARE THE PRIORITIES OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THESE ARE. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRIORITIES- AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IVORY TOWER BUT DON'T REFLECT OUR CONSTITUENTS VALUES. RESPONSE. I THINK THAT OUR STUDENTS WOULD WANT THE UNIVERSITY TO HAVE HIGH QUALITY AND AS OF THE THIRD LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HELP OUR STAFF SALARIES KEEP UP WITH INFLATION SO I THINK THE INTEREST OF THE UNIVERSITY AND THE STATE ARE VERY MUCH ALIGNED AND MAKING CERTAIN THAT THE BASE BUDGET OF THE UNIVERSITY'S HEALTHY. WE CAN INCREASE ENROLLMENT FOR THIS FALL WE HAD A 13% INCREASE IN CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE APPLICATIONS WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT WEIGHTLESS WITH HIGHLY QUALIFIED STUDENTS. IF WE HAD THE FUNDING WE CAN PULL THOSE STUDENTS AND ENROLL THEM THIS FALL SO WE CAN ALIGN OUR PRIORITIES- SHOULD THERE BE FUNDING FOR IT. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT REGARDING OUR INITIATIVE- THE FRAMEWORK TWENTY THIRTY TO GET STUDENTS TO GRADUATE FASTER. WE HAVE SO MANY PELL GRANT ELIGIBLE STUDENTS THAT IF WE GET THEM TO GRADUATE AT THE SAME TIME AS NON ALL ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. WE COULD INCREASE THROUGHPUT BY MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS EACH YEAR THAT WOULD BE AN INCREASE AT THE CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES THAT WE'RE TAKING AND SO THERE'S THAT INVESTMENT WHILE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT AN INVESTMENT ENROLLMENT BECAUSE IT'S TALKING ABOUT STUDENT SUCCESS. IT ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY. IS AN ENROLLMENT INVESTMENT. OKAY THANK YOU LET ME PIVOT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THAT THE LAST- ISSUE ON THE AGENDA. IS ONE THAT'S BEEN- OF ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR NUMBER OF YEARS AND THAT'S- ACCESS TO OUR TO OUR HIGHLY COVETED CAMPUSES YOU KNOW YOU SEE THE- NINE- STE YOU KNOW NINE CAMPUS UNDERGRADUATE- INSTITUTION. THEN OF THE NINE CAMPUSES- YOU KNOW THREE ARE REALLY THAT THE MARQUEE AS FAR AS ACCESO TWEETS WHICHEVER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. CAN YOU START TALKING SO WE CAN SEE THAT. YEAH DID YOU HAVE A YES EPIC YEAH YES HAVE THE SAY ONE WORD TO GET YOUR FEET YOU'RE AT UP THERE YOUR BRAND. SO- IT'S I KNOW A PRIORITY OF THE ASSEMBLY AND FRANKLY NOW THE SENATE IS PUSHING HARD ON THIS AS FAR AS THE NON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT. I KNOW THE CAMPUSES OF SAN DIEGO. BERKELEY IN LA WILL SAY MORE INTERNATIONAL. AND NON RAT AND NOT A NON CALIFORNIAN WEALTHY STUDENTS. EXPAND ACCESS TO THOSE CAMPUSES BUT- YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT THOSE. AT THOSE- PREMIERE CAMPUSES IS JUST THROUGH THE ROOF. AND IT'S HARDEST TO SHOW THAT THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIANS SO. AS WE KNOW IT HERE WE DO HAVE- SOMEONE SEVEN SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME RESOURCES SO. IS IT SAID ALL A PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION. TO LOWER THE- THERE THE RATIO. AT THOSE THAT THOSE THREE SPECIALLY THOSE THREE CAMPUSES I KNOW THAT CAMPUS IS LIKE RIVERSIDE OTHERS ATTEMPTING TO GROW UP. SANTA CRUZ BUT OF THOSE THREE IT'S BECOME IT'S BECOME. INCREASINGLY. TICKED UP A PROBLEM. WE'RE BURNSIDE OFF ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS. SO WHAT'S YOURS LET ME STAY ON ON AGAIN ON RESIDENT ENROLLMENT HERE MINISTRATION IS OPEN TO FURTHER DISCUSSION WE KNOW THAT'S A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY IN TERMS OF NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT. THAT NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT WENT DOWNTOWN AND THEREFORE ON RESIDENT TUITION WENT DOWN THAT WOULD CREATE SIGNIFICANT COST PRESSURE ON THE STATE TO BACK FILL THAT. YEAH I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S TRUE THAT NON RESIDENT- APPLICATIONS WENT DOWN BUT THEY WENT DOWN FROM LIKE SIXTY THOUSAND TO FIFTY FIVE I'M NOT SURE THE NUMBER STILL SLIGHTLY DOWN AND THE NUMBER OF SLOTS YOU HAD FOR NON RESIDENTS WAS STILL. YOU KNOW YOU HAD FOUR MORE TIMES APPLICATIONS IF I RECALL THAN SLOTS AVAILABLE FOR NON RESIDENTS SO THERE'S STILL A TREMENDOUS DEMAND IN INTERNATIONAL EVEN DURING COVERED EVEN WHEN THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS YOU KNOW MAKING THAT YOU KNOW HARDER AND LESS ATTRACTIVE FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS TO COME. TO AMERICA TO STUDY. YOU'RE STILL A HUGE HUGE DEMAND- FOR INTERNATIONAL BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ARE ARE YOU WILLING TO LOWER THE RATIO AT THE THREE PREMIERE CAMPUSES. SO CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO ARE GRADUATING FOUR POINT FIVE GPAS AND- AND DOING VERY WELL CAN CAN BE MORE VIABLE. FOR OUR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FLAGSHIP CAMPUSES. SO IF YOU IF THERE'S A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL THAT COMES MORE THAN WE CAN. CONSIDER THAT AND I CAN TAKE IT BACK TO MANAGEMENT FOR CONSIDERATION BUT AGAIN I WOULD NOTE THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT. A NON RESIDENT TUITION I WENT DOWN FOR THE UC SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT COST PRESSURE ON THE STATE TOBACCO YEAH AND ONE THING IS THAT- I DON'T KNOW FOR CHARGING ENOUGH IN NON RESIDENT TUITION. CHARGING MORE NONRESIDENT TUITION. I THINK IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER. HELP CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE TRYING TO PAY FOR COLLEGE I WANT TO PIVOT NOW TO THIS- TO THIS LEARNING ALIGNED STUDENT EMPLOYMENT I. SENSUALLY LIKE STATE FUNDED INTERNSHIPS AS KIND OF WHAT I. SEE IT AS- SO ONE IS- IS IT HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT JUST PROVIDING A BUNCH TO. FREE LABOR TO. FROM TO TINA TECH COMPANIES AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES ARE JUST WANT TO HAVE. AN OPPORTUNE HAVE FREE WORKERS RIGHT AND THEN TO- HOW TO BE A READ IS THIS MEANS TESTED. ARE WE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO BENEFIT FROM THIS ARE YOU YOU KNOW PELL RECIPIENTS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE FOCUS ON WHO YEAH SO THOSE. YEAH I THINK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS THE AND WE KNOW WHAT THE CONCERN IS AND THE CONCERN ABOUT POTENTIALLY FREE LABOR THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSAL SPECIFIES THAT THE IN THERE A CAMPUS AND- WENT CREEK IN AGREEMENT WITH AN EMPLOYER. WOULD FIRST OF PRIORITIZE AND TRY TO TRY TO GET IN THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE FINANCIALLY TO THE HOURLY WAGE AVE- STUDENT PLOY AND IT HAS A LITTLE SECOND PART AS FAR AS- WILL BE A REQUIREMENT FOR INCOME YEAH THEY'RE AND THEY'RE- TRAILER BILL ALSO SPECIFIES THAT THAT THIS IS A LOW INCOME TARGETED- PROGRAM. AS WELL THE OTHER CATEGORIES BEING- FOSTER YOUTH HOMELESS USE BUTTE A BIGGER UMBRELLA OF UNDERREPRESENTED BACKGROUND SO IT IS A- TARGETED. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA YEAH I DON'T THINK THIS IS A UP SINCE THAT TERRIBLE IDEA BUT I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS NEED TO BE SORTED OUT AS WELL AS WE NEED TO. TO RECONCILE THIS WITH OUR OTHER PRIORITIES- LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT I SPENT THE FIRST PART OF MY QUESTIONING AND COMMENTS ABOUT AS FAR AS OF OVERALL- ACCESS SO- AND THEN WERE IN REGARDS TO THE- THE LINE ITEM. YOU KNOW. WHAT WAS WILL YOU KNOW TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION. NOT CERTAIN THAT IT'S THAT IT'S TIME FOR THAT ESPECIALLY- IN LIGHT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OUR STATE AUDITOR THAT THIS IS A SOUND POLICY SO. THAT'S IT FOR NOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. YEAH I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE- THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHICO'S- ALMA MATER. UC BERKELEY WAS RECENTLY RECOGNIZED AS THE NUMBER ONE. PUBLIC INSTITUTION. IN THE UNITED STATES AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE- THE TO THE POINT THAT OUR CHAIRS MAKING. IT WOULD SEEM LIKE TO ME THAT YOU SEE SHOULD NOT HAVE A PROBLEM. IN BOTH MAINTAINING THE HIGH QUALITY THAT WE EXPECT. FROM UP THE PREMIER INSTITUTION AND AT THE SAME TIME MAKING ROOM. FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND- AND I JUST WANT TO- MENTION. IT'S PUT ON THE TABLE THE IDEA THAT WE ARE A COUPLE YEARS AGO FROM THE L. A. O. AND THAT IS TO PROVIDE METRICS. TO YOU SEE. UNFUNDED AT AND THE IDEA THAT YOU SEE YOU WOULD HAVE TO MEET. CERTAIN METRICS THAT WE PROPOSE SO THAT IT WOULD INDEED BE MISTER CHAIR. RIGHT THE PRIORITIES OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT YOU SEE WOULD HAVE TO MEET THOSE GOALS- IN ORDER. TO RECEIVE THE FUNDING THE CONTINUES FUNDING THAT WERE GIVEN SO JUST JUST PUT NOT ON THE TABLE- AS AS IDEA THAT WE HEARD A COUPLE YEARS BACK- AND- MAKING THE POINT THAT IT MAY BE GOOD TO REVISIT THAT. MOVING FORWARD. OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- DONALD YES THANK YOU HAVE A THAT MAYBE I BELIEVE THIS- QUESTION BE FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHAT IS THE- UC BERKELEY ALTERNATIVE MEATS LAB. WE GO. SO ALL RESTATE WHAT THE INVESTMENT IS AND THEN PERHAPS MY COLLEAGUE MISPERTON CAN SPEAK TO MORE SPECIFICALLY BUT THE PROPOSAL IS JUST A GENERAL ONE MILLION US ONE TIME SUPPORT FOR THE ALTERNATIVE MEATS LAB- ALL ALL DEFERRED TO HER. YEAH MAYBE JUST TELL ME WHAT. WHAT THE MEAT LAB DOES. SAVER CAN AND GET A RECEIPT OF CALIFORNIA AT THE UC BERKELEY ALTERNATIVE MEAT LAB RESEARCHERS ARE PLANT BASED ALTERNATIVES TO MEAT PRODUCTS- AND WORKS WITH ENTREPRENEURS TO TRY TO BRING THOSE TO MARKET THE INTENT HERE IS TO REDUCE OUR IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE DUE TO. MASS ANIMAL FARMING. OKAY THANK YOU I GUESS IT WOULDN'T BE MEET THE OFFICE PLANTS BUT OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN I JUST HAVE ANOTHER BREAK A COMMONER QUITE WELL WE'RE PROBABLY A QUESTION FOR THE UC AT ITS FACILITIES NOT ALWAYS THE MOST EXCITING TOPIC IN THIS ROOM BUT FACILITIES ARE IMPORTANT. WELL LAST YEAR WE HAD A SCHOOL BOND THAT FAILED AND IT FAILED FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS- MS CALL PROPOSITION THIRTEEN THAT CONFUSE THE VOTERS. I HAD SOME THINGS THAT THE PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE MAYBE THE DOLLAR THRESHOLD WAS TOO HIGH. BUT ALSO RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE DIDN'T RECEIVE AS MUCH SUPPORT AS BECAUSE HIGHER EDUCATION. WAS IN THAT THAT BOND. SO I WENT OUT AND DID SOME RESEARCH AND WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THERE WAS ACTUALLY AN AGREEMENT STAKEHOLDERS CAME TOGETHER. AND SAID HEY WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUT YOU IN THE NEXT SCHOOL BOND. BUT WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EACH SEGMENT TO UNDER MILLION DOLLARS HERE. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO LET YOURSELF BOND FOR YOUR FAILITIES TO A MILLION DOLLARS HERE. AND GET A CELLPHONE. SO AS WE GO FORWARD- MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS DO YOU DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE ON THE PATH OF SELF% BONDING IN THE IN THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION. OR DO YOU WANT TO BE IN A FUTURE SCHOOL FUNDING HE REALLY CAN'T I CAN'T ADVOCATE FOR BOTH- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I WOULD RATHER TAKE. THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR. AND THE ABILITY TO SELF ON BIGGEST ARGUABLY. YOUR FACILITIES- HAVE DONE BETTER UNDER THAT MODEL THEN GOING FORWARD. IN A SCHOOL BOND ONLY MODEL CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- OF. THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU SEE. WHAT THE COVERED THE PRIOR STATE G. WILL BOND PAYMENTS THAT WERE ALSO TRANSFERRED TO UC. WE REFINANCE THOSE AND NOW COVERED THOSE FROM OUR OWN BUDGET. WHEN I TALKED ABOUT OUR BASE BUDGET HAVING OF BONDS. ALSO INCREASES. I WAS REFERRING TO THIS PROCESS- REPEAT WHAT'S CALLED AB NINETY FOUR PROCESS. YOU SEE IS ABLE TO CONSTRUCT OUR OWN BUILDINGS YOU SEEN OUR STATE APPROPRIATION AS THE COLLATERAL. WE ARE NOW EXPERIENCING ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN COST INCREASES DUE TO THE BUILDINGS WE ARE BUILDING. SO THAT PROCESS IS WORKING FOR US. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO- DO SOME SEISMIC MAKE RENOVATIONS AND CONSTRUCTS SOME BUILDINGS. BUT IT IS QUITE EXPENSIVE AND PLACES. ACOSTA STRAIN. ON THE FUNDING WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO THE CAMPUSES. IN ORDER TO- COVER THEIR COST INCREASES. SO WE WOULD PREFER A STATE. NEW STATE YOUR BOND. TO HELP US WITH. OUR MASSIVE SEISMIC. RENOVATION NEEDS WE HAVE ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN SEISMIC RENOVATION NEEDS. THAT WE COULD GET GOING ON. TOMORROW IF WE HAD THE MONEY. SO YOU WANT. OKAY SO DO YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE CURRENT MODEL WHERE YOU DO RECEIVE THOSE DOLLARS. AND YOU ARE DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO SELF MONITOR YOU WANTED STATEWIDE G. OF. ON OF ONE OR THE OTHER BECAUSE I CAN'T- ASK MY- I CAN'T. FOR BOTH. SO WHICH WOULD YOU PREFER YOU HAVE ANY TODAY IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TODAY THAT'S FINE. WE WOULD RATHER NOT CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO PROCESSES TODAY IF I COULD GET BACK TO YOU SIR THAT WOULD BE OPTIMAL WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY PREFER BOTH. BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT- AT THIS POINT. THEY THINK THAT'S FEASIBLE. DR EIGHT YET THAT IS CORRECT AND THAT THAT AS FOR THE REASONS I'VE LAID OUT WANT TO SUPPORT YOU ON THE FACILITY SIDE I THINK SOME THE CHANGES WE'VE MADE. HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN BETTER THAN THE UC RE THAT RELYING ON STATE BOND MONEY- FOR THE INSTITUTION AS YOU HAVE LAID OUT- SO I THINK I THINK YOU. THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER AND THEN MISLED US. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP THE FARM- BECAUSE THAT THAT'S A GOOD SEGUE INTO WHAT I WANT TO ASK ABOUT IN THIS BUDGET- MANY MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT THE- UC. AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES PROGRAM. THAT'S OPERATED THROUGH THIS YOU SEE BUDGET- BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR DECADES IN HELPING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- THE LATEST SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE IN HELPING FARMERS. GROW THE SAFEST- YOU KNOW MOST RESILIENT AND PLENTIFUL CROPS AND IS IN THE WORLD- BEEN A HUGE BENEFIT. I IN THIS BUDGET RIGHT NOW WE ARE TAKING THAT LINE ITEM OUT OF THE BUDGET I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER AND LUMPING IT IN TOGETHER. WITH THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT- BUDGET. I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW IN IN MY DISTRICT ALONE WE HAVE OVER THIRTEEN CRITICAL POSITIONS THAT ARE VACANT- RIGHT NOW THESE ARE THINGS SUCH AS AN IRRIGATION SPECIALIST ORCHARD IST INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT. A RICE AND SMALL FARMING VILLAGE CROP SPECIALISTS IN PLACES LIKE COLUSA SHASTA TO HEMA. BUTTE AND YUBA COUNTIES WE ALSO HAVE NO ADVISER RIGHT NOW FOR THE FOUR H. PROGRAM AND MANY MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH FOR AGES YOU KNOW USED IN AGRICULTURE- PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN YOU KNOW VERY GOOD FOR OUR FOR OUR YOUTH IN TERMS OF BUILDING LEADERSHIP SKILLS BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW BILLION THAT NEXT GENERATION OF FARMERS- AND AGRICULTURALIST AND BILLION THAT KNOWLEDGE BASE THAT WE CONSTANTLY NEED TO- TO GROW- RIGHT NOW I HAVE NO NO ADVISER THERE AT ALL FOR BUTTE AND GLENN COUNTIES WHICH HAVE SOME OF THE LARGEST FOUR EIGHT CHAPTERS IN THE- IN THE STATE- ALSO WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION TALKS A LOT ABOUT GOALS IN TERMS OF CLIMATE RESILIENCE. PEST MANAGEMENT IRRIGATION PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY. ON FARMS IN THE NEED. TO SUPPORT NEW AND BEGINNING. FARMERS AND RANCHERS- THIS IS A RESOURCE THAT DOES ALL THOSE THINGS- THE UC ANR- PROGRAM. SO I HAVE A REAL CONCERN ABOUT IF WE REMOVE THIS LINE ITEM COMPLETELY AND PUT THE DISCRETION COMPLETELY. UNDER THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IS THIS PROGRAM GOING TO CONTINUE- HAVE VERY STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND HOWCAN WE AS A LEGISLATURE ENSURE THAT- THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. GOING INTO THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE DIRECTED TO- THIS PROGRAM. WITHOUT HAVING A DIRECT LINE ITEM I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN- I WOULD JUST ASK FIRST TO THE UC. WHAT'S YOUR COMMITMENT. TO CONTINUE THIS PROGRAM IN TERMS OF REAL DOLLARS- IF THIS LINE ITEM IS TAKEN OUT. AND IS INSTEAD KIND OF LUMPED INTO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT- BUDGET ITEM. THANK YOU SIR FOR THE QUESTION- SO FIRST I WANT TO COMMENT THAT THE UC ANR BUDGET HAS BEEN PART OF THE U. C. O. P. OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT FOR MANY MANY DECADES- THEY DID NOT GET THEIR OWN LINE ITEM UNTIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN- IF THE LINE ITEM. IS ELIMINATED THEIR SEVERAL WAYS THAT WE CAN ENSURE UC ANR RECEIVES THE FUNDING THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO PROPERLY SERVE THE STATE. ONE OF THE SAYS WE HAVE A SYSTEM CALLED SET ASIDES FROM OUR CAMPUS ALLOCATION. THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THE GOVERNOR- AND TO THE STATE IN GENERAL THAT WE- TAKE SORT OF OFF THE TOP. OF THE- GENERAL ALLOCATION TO THE CAMPUS AS WE CURRENTLY FUND THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATIONS IN THIS MATTER. THAT'S TO ENSURE THAT THEY GET THEIR FUNDING EVERY YEAR AND THAT THEY GROW WITH A COLA REGARDLESS OF WHAT ELSE MAY HAPPEN. THE WEEKEND FUND UC ANR IN THAT MATTER YOU CAN ALSO PUT IN SOME BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE SPECIFYING THE INCREASES. OR THE TOTAL AMOUNT. OF THE UC BUDGET THAT SHOULD GO TO UC ANR. I KNOW THAT THE SENATE IS VERY INTERESTED IN INCREASING DO YOU SEE IT IN OUR BUDGET- AND I AM WORKING WITH THEM ON SOME LANGUAGE THAT CAN BE PUT INTO THE BUDGET TO ENSURE THAT. THEIR INVESTMENTS GET PUT. INTO PLACE WHERE- THE LEGISLATURE WANTS THEM TO BE. YEAH AND YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT TWENTY TEAM IS THE FIRST BUT THAT WAS ALSO PART OF OUR TRANSPARENCY WITH YOU SEE OPERATE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OUR CONCERNS ABOUT MONEY THAT WAS. YOU KNOW BEING SQUIRRELED AWAY THAT NOBODY KNEW ABOUT- AND HOW TRANSPARENCY TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE. THAT MONEY IS GOING- L. A. BY THE WAY RECOMMENDS THAT WE CONTINUE TO KEEP- YOU SEE A AND R. AS A SEPARATE. LINE ITEM SO I THINK WE SHOULD. ENSURE THAT WE DO THAT IN THIS BUDGET PROCESS- IN A SURE THAT WE KEEP. FINDING WHAT I THINK IS A REALLY VITAL TOOL- YOU KNOW FOR AGRICULTURE- THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND AGAIN THESE OPERATE NOT JUST OF MY DISTRICT THERE- IT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND- GIVING TECHNICAL ASSISTANT HELPING- NEAR. NEW FARMERS WHO ARE COMING IN THE INDUSTRY- MANY MINORITY FARMERS WHO ARE COMING INTO THE INDUSTRY- SO WE NEED TO ENSURE THIS PROGRAM- IS SUFFICIENTLY FUNDED AND- AND THE POSITIONS ARE FILLED. YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID WE HAVE POSITIONS THAT AREN'T EVEN BEING FILLED- RIGHT NOW SO THAT WOULD BE MY- MY BIG CONCERN WITH THIS BUDGET SO FAR SO OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER IS THE ONLY MEMBER OF AYE IT AT US. JUST TO CONTINUE ON THIS QUESTIONING OF THIS- THIS LINE ITEM SET SEPARATION DOES THE ADMINISTRATION. DO YOU HAVE AN EXAMPLE TO POINT TO THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE CURRENT BUDGETING STRUCTURE HINDERS YOU YOU WITH THESE OPERATIONS UC'S OPERATIONS. QUESTION. BUT I WOULD I WOULD RESTATED THE ADMINISTRATION'S ARE WRAPPED CAL IS TO ENSURE FLEXIBILITY FALSO PRESERVING THE TRANSPARENCY IN THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. THROUGH BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ALL POINT TO- BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES TO ATTEND IN HER OPENING REMARKS DID MENTION THAT THIS PAST YEAR. DURING THE PANDEMIC THERE WAS A SPECIFIC SITUATION WITH FEDERAL RESOURCES THAT. PREVENTED YOU COPD FROM FROM EASILY- WORKING THROUGH WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH MORE STUPID OPERATIONAL- SYSTEM IN SORT OF ABSORBING AND USING RESOURCES THAT BENEFIT ALL THE CAMPUSES AND THEREFORE YOU SEE STUDENTS SOUGHT A LETTER ELABORATED SHE- IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN HEARING MORE ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC EXAMPLE BUT THE OVERALL RATIONALE IS THE- WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S- HAPPENED FLEXIBILITY. BUT THAT ALSO PRESERVE THE TRANSPARENCY. FOR THE L. L. AWAY AND THIS. SO FAR WE HEARD ARE YOU SEE BRING UP THIS EXAMPLE YESTERDAY TO EAT WE'D BE HAPPY TO CIRCLE BACK WITH STOCKTON FOLLOW UP ON THIS YOU KNOW GENERALLY ON THE MORE LIGHT ITEMS YOU ADD IN THE BUDGET THE LESS FLEXIBILITY THERE IS THAT IS A- BASIC TRADE OFF THAT THE LEGISLATURE FACES WHATEVER IT. IS CONSIDERING ADDING OR SUBTRACTING LINE ITEMS ON THERE ARE TOOLS SOMETIMES THAT ALLOW THE- THERE ARE TOOLS IN THE IN THE BUDGET THAT SOMETIMES A LOT FOR SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY- SO AGAIN I. AT WHETHER OR NOT THIS ONE EXAMPLE BIRDS COMPLETELY ELIMINATING THE LINE ITEM OR CONSIDERING OCCUR BUDGET TOOLS THESE ARE THINGS WE BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP ON. LOOKING TO STAFF. OKAY S. R. ONE ONE MORE QUESTION HERE- AND JUST TO RE VISIT THE MAY REVISION AND THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION- TO ESTABLISH THE ENDOWMENT FOR LEARNING ONLINE EMPLOYMENT- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT TAXPAYERS DIDN'T SIGN UP. TO CONTRIBUTE TO UC'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WHEN THEY PAY TAXES THIS YEAR. AND RATHER THAN LOOKING AT THESE FUNDS THAT ARE IN AND DOWN MA'AM THESE THE STATE SHOULD CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES THAT HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT. ON STUDENT ACCESS AND SUCCESS. OR REDUCE LONG TERM DEPTH AND OR TO REDUCE LONG TERM DOESN'T LIABILITIES SO I'M JUST. TO THE UC'S WHAT ONE TIME INVESTMENT. DID YOU SEE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING THE GREATEST IMPACT ON STUDENT SUCCESS. ONE TIME INVESTMENTS ARE OFTEN- A LITTLE DIFFICULT AND STUDENT SUCCESS TERMS BUT SOME OF THAT- SOME OF THE ONES THAT WE WOULD LIKE. ARE THINGS LIKE HELPING TO ESTABLISH CENTERS ON THE CAMPUSES FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND STUDENTS IMPACTED BY INCARCERATION AND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS TO HELP THEM SUCCEED. WE COULD GET STARTED ON- SUMMER BRIDGE PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE. IN HELPING STUDENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS GET THIRD JUMP STARTED ON THEIR COLLEGE CAREER THEY COME TO THE UC CAMPUS FOR THE SUMMER AS A COHORT DAY TAKE CLASSES TOGETHER TO GET MENTORING AND TRAINING. AND THEN THEY'RE READY TO THROW IN THE FALL- AND PROCEED WITH THEIR MAJORS SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS THAT WILL BE VERY VERY HELPFUL- IN ADDITION A ONE TIME INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL OUTLAYS BUT HELP IS. EITHER CONSTRUCT NEW CLASSROOMS WHICH WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR FUTURE ENROLLMENT EXPANSION OF SEISMIC RENOVATIONS AND ALSO POSSIBLE LAND ACQUISITION OF NEW PROPERTIES FOR POTENTIAL FUTURE CAMPUS EXPANSIONS. SHOULD. THOSE OPPORTUNITIES BECOME AVAILABLE. AND YOU SEE HOW HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AS OF AUGUST IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND I CAN IMAGINE THAT THE BALANCE IS LIKELY GROWN SINCE THEN I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT- WHAT THAT GROWTH LOOKS LIKE AND HAS THE UC CONSIDERED USING THEIR EARNINGS. FROM THE INVESTMENTS TO FUND- WORK STUDY PROGRAMS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION OF THE CURRENT ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. THANK YOU SEE THE BOSTON OFFICE ARE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT IS OUR RETIREMENT PROGRAMS. AND THOSE- INVESTMENT RETURNS MUST BE RETURNED TO THE RETIREMENT PROGRAM SO THAT FUNDS. ARE EMPLOYEES FUTURE- WE ALSO HAVE RESTRICTED ENDOWMENTS- MORE THAN 80% OF OUR ENDOWMENTS ARE RESTRICTED BASED ON DONOR CRITERIA AND WE CANNOT TAKE THE- WE CANNOT TAKE THE PROCEEDS FROM THOSE AND USE THEM FOR OTHER PURPOSES OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL INDICTMENT PURPOSE. WE HAVE NOT- A WITHIN YOU SEE THOUGHT ABOUT STARTING OUR OWN WORK STUDY PROGRAM YET- THIS PROPOSAL CAME FROM THE GOVERNOR IT'S VERY INTRIGUING THE CURRENT NUMBER OF FEDERAL WORK STUDIES OF POSSESSIONS IS LIMITED- BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING SO WHAT THE FUNDING IS GONE THERE'S NO MORE. WORK STUDY POSITION SO THIS WOULD HELP EXPAND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF WORK STUDY POSITIONS AVAILABLE. TO OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RACE. THANK YOU MR UP I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE ONE TIME FUNDING- CLEARLY THAT THE STATE HAS SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME OF RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THIS YEAR I AM CONCERNED AND I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE CHAIRS AND QUESTIONS REGARDING. THERE BEING NO ENROLLMENT TARGET NO INCREASE IN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS BEING ADMITTED. HOW CAN THE STATE USE THE ONE TIME FUNDING TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY OF UC'S AND WHY ISN'T THE ADMINISTRATION SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE OF EXPANDING. THE CAPACITY EXPANDING ENROLLMENT SPECIFICALLY FOR OUR CALIFORNIA APPLICANTS. SURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ALL JUST RESTATE THAT ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT HAPPEN ENROLLMENT TARGET IN THE MAY REVISE BUT THE TEXTURE OF GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WE ARE GOING FORWARD INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE KNOW THIS IS A PRIORITY. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. CAN YOU TELL US SPECIFICALLY WHAT HOW DO YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING- RECOGNIZING- AND YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE COOK MY COLLEAGUES WHAT AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY THAT IS AND HAS BEEN IT ISN'T JUST THIS YEAR- THE- HOW DO YOU ENVISION THIS CONVERSATION GOING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE HOW WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE THE UC CAPACITY- FOR OUR- WEEKLY AGAIN FOR CALIFORNIA APPLICANTS. YES THEY PREDICT THE FOLLOW UP I CAN JUST SPECIFY THAT THE KEY TO GOING FORWARD IS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE TO WORK WITH THE UC THIS WILL ALSO GO FOR THE CSU. ON WHAT ENROLLMENT TARGETS COULD LOOK LIKE NOW AND IN THE FUTURE SO WE WANT TO DO THIS IN DISCUSSION WITH THE SEGMENTS THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I DO KNOW THAT IF I MAY USE THAT AS A FOLLOW UP. THERE ARE SOME UNITS UNIVERSITIES IT SOME UC'S WHO HAVE. BEEN VERY SPECIFIC AND INTENTIONAL ABOUT INCREASING THE ENROLLMENT OF LOCAL STUDENTS SANDED MINORITY STUDENTS. UNIVERSITIES UC'S LIKE YOU SEE ARE VERY SPECIFICALLY WHO HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THIS REGARD. I THINK THAT- TO FIND SOME OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THAT REGARD WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE- THE- ART I KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER WORD BUT THE LEAD TO- UC'S LIKE BERKELEY. BUT I THINK IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE THAT ARE MOST EFFECTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY AND FOR CALIFORNIA APPLICANTS THEN WE LOOK NEED TO LOOK TO THE MODELS LIKE. YOU SEE OUR TO SEE WHAT IT IS THAT THEY ARE DOING RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO MODEL OTHER ENROLLMENT GOALS- ED TARGETS- IT'S EASY TO MODEL THEM TO. TO UC'S LIKE YOU SEE ARE SO THANK. YOU SO MUCH. OKAY I THINK THAT NO FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS WE WILL HOLD. THIS ISSUE OVER AND PROCEED NOW TO THE C. A FINANCE.

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON- ON HOW. IN A TARGET WEEK. CSU ROUGHLY HUNDRED SIX MILLION- KNOWS IT. COMMA BLAME CHECK. BUT DON'T VOTE ON. THE TOP- ISSUES WE HEAR CROSSES TO FROM OUR- CONSTITUENTS AS- TO THE SEA SAYS. AT THANK YOU A CALL THE- THIS IS- JOE WE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEY ME AS MY COLLEAGUE FOR A OVERSEEING THE UNIVERSE OF BUDGET OTHER REVISION NOT SERVICE BROWN CAR FOR BY YOU WHEN YOU SEE. AND WHILE WE WERE THAT CAL RESIDENT ROMANCE AT CS AND UC IS A PRIORITY THE LETTER.

OF FOR THE THANK YOU. OKAY DO WE HAVE AT CSU NOW AVAILABLE RAINSTORM. OKAY. TELL LET'S GO BACK IN THE MEANTIME TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN YOU RESPOND TO THE- THAT THE POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY- PROPOSAL- OBVIOUSLY THAT HAVING ANOTHER POLITECNICA NEVER CITY- IS A POSITIVE THING IN THE CSU SYSTEM WE DO HAVE ONE AT CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO WHICH IS YOU KNOW IMPACTED IN HUGE DEMAND. THAT THEY CAL POLY NOT TOO FAR FROM PRAMANA NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE IN ENGLAND EMPIRE IS A COP CAL POLY IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES AND MY UNDERSTANDING IT DOESN'T HAVE THE DEMAND- AS FAR AS THE APPLICATION SO WHAT MAKES US THINK THAT THIS ONE. YOU KNOW AND A NEARLY HALF A BILL DOLLARS INFUSION. WILL WILL PRODUCE THE SAME OUTCOMES THAT WE SEE IT CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AS THE MINISTER SHOULD LEAVE THAT CSU IS A UNIQUELY SITUATED TO PROVIDE AN AFFORDABLE OPTION FOR US THEN ENHANCE EDUCATION WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROMOTING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH STEM ORIENTED JOBS IN THE REGION- GIVEN THE ABSENCE OF A POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY IN THE FAR NORTH COASTAL REGION. OF THE STATE AND HUBBLE STATES CURRENT ROLE AS PRODUCER OF THE THIRD HIGHEST NUMBER OF STEM UNDERGRADUATES AND THIS UC SYSTEM AT AS YOU MENTIONED AFTER CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO AS WELL CAL POLY POMONA- THE MAY REVISION AS INVESTMENT. CONSISTING OF ALL THE LINES WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OVERALL FOCUS ON MEETING WORKFORCE NEEDS AND RECOGNIZING OPPORTUNITIES AMONG REGIONS OF ALL. CALIFORNIA. OKAY. MISTER MISTER TAKE YOU MISTER MEDIA YEAH ON THE ON THE- TRANSITION TO A POLITECHNIKA RECEDED AT CSU HUMBOLDT- I YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S AN EXCITING- MOVEMENT ON ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNOR I KNOW THAT IT WILL HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON TAT REGION- HAVING VISITED. CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO SEVERAL TIMES AND- KNOWING THE GREAT WORK THAT IS DONE THERE AND THE- YOU KNOW THE QUALITY. OF- OF THEIR EDUCATION- ESPECIALLY IN THE SCIENCES. ENGINEERING I'M SURE HUMBOLDT WOULD DO THE SAME. THAT AND THIS QUESTION MAY BE BETTER DIRECTED TO- CSU AND THE MR STARR BUT BUT ONE QUESTION THAT THE RAISES IT IN MY MIND IS THE DIVERSITY. OF- OF- BOTH CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO AND WONDERING- WHAT WOULD MEASURES WILL BE TAKEN TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MORE DIVERSITY- WOULD WOULD- OCCUR AT CSU HUMBOLDT. A GIVEN ITS GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. AND HOW WE CAN ENSURE. MORE DIVERSITY IN THOSE KIND OF SCIENTIFIC ENGINEERING PROGRAMS STEM FIELDS- AND IT CERTAINLY MEASURE SHOULD BE TAKEN AT THE OUTSET TO. TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. THIS STABBED A SHIPMENT OF- A THIRD POLYTECHNIC. NOT QUITE IS PROBABLY BETTER DIRECTED TO- SEE ISSUE. OKAY ADMINISTERS ARM WITH US YET. THIS IS MY CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW X. OKAY GREAT I LOVE THE FACT THAT THE- SOUNDS WORK FOR THIS MORNING AND NOW NOW I SOMEBODY BAD MY APOLOGIES FOR MISSING OUT BOB THINK OF A BECAUSE IT YEAH YOU NINETEEN AND TWENTY TO TWENTY ONE SO YEAH MY APOLOGIES MA'AM ARE FOR THAT- I'M SO- MR MEDINA I WAS UNABLE TO HEAR THE BIGELOW. I THANK I CAN READ IT LET ME REPEAT IT- KNOW JUST A RECOGNIZE THE TRANS TO A THIRD OF AT CSU HUMBOLDT IS EXCITING THAT IT CERTAINLY WOULD US- IN ON THE READ. OF THE RE- HAVING VISIT CAL SAN LUIS OBISPO NO I KNOW THE HYPE. NO THE HIGH IT STANDARDS OF CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO- MY QUESTION WAS ABOUT DIVERSITY- YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THAT THAT CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO- AS MANY PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO TRY TO WORK ON- AND IMPROVING THEIR DIVERSITY AND I JUST. ASKING BUT WHAT MEASURES WOULD BE IN PLACE AT HUMBOLDT YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY GIVEN ITS YOU KNOW IT'S SOMEWHAT GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION- AWAY FROM YOU KNOW POPULATION CENTERS UP SO WHAT MEASURES MIGHT BE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT DIVERSITY IS REFLECTED AT. THE TO THIS THIRD POLITECNICA. WITH THE SYSTEM. WELL A COUPLE OF THINGS- FIRST FOREMOST AT THE UNIVERSITY. LOCALLY. SEVEN OVERALL IT'S POPULATION US- SEVENTEEN PER OF ITS US BODY YES FOR THE LOCAL. IT MEANS THAT EIGHTY THREE PER OF IT OF THE STUDENTS COME OTHER. OPERA OF THE BIGGEST DRAW FROM SO CAL. SO WITH US- CAL BEING A REALLY DIVERSE AREA ALREADY. YOU CAN SEE THAT THE OTHER THING TOO IS THAT I BELIEVE 50% OF. STUDENTS WHO ATTEND HSE RIGHT NOW ARE YOU AROUND AND- PERSON GENERATION TO IT TO ATTEND UNIVERSITY SO DIVERSITY IS THERE- SO- I THINK IT'S OF GOING FORWARD. THAT'S IT'S ONE OF THE CORE- THE COURT ISSUES IS OF COURSE FOR THE UNIVERSITY HAS SAID IS GRADUATE ISSUE. AND ALSO. THAT GAPS THAT ARE BEACH ARGUE HANDS. AND AS WELL AS OUR FELLOW WHICH WILL STAY. WHEN HAVE AN OP. I LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TELL TO. BROWN BACK AND MY CALL AND THEN I CAN- MAYBE MORE HEALTH TO THE CAN AFFECT IF YOU WANT MY- BETTER BUT I WANT TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SIR. THANK YOU YEAH SO MAYBE WRITTEN REFER. MAYBE MR STARKEY YOU GO BACK AND FOCUS ON YOUR- YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION ON THE NAY RIVAS REAL QUICK. RATE AND IT WILL BE VERY LONG- SO AGAIN I'M RIGHTS FOR A- FOR BUDGET PROMISE ISSUE- I WANNA. TOUCH ON THREE ISSUE FIRST THE BASE AUGMENT. THAT I'M HUMBLE. AND THEN ON A DEFERRED. FIRST LET'S WITH THE BASED ON. I WANT TO SAY THE WE TO SEIZE YOUR OF EVERYTHING. TO THE GUY FOR THE- OF THAT TO NINETY NINE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET CUTS LAST YEAR. IN PROVIDING THAT I KNOW. SEVENTY FOUR FOUR DOLLAR TO OUR- THAT'S GOING TO HELP ELIMINATE OUR EQUITY GAPS THROUGH. CONNECTED TWENTY TWENTY. IT'S GOING ADDRESS OTHER MANY BECAUSE INCREASE LIKE. I. HEALTH COSTING. SO THAT ALL THREE OF. ELEMENTS THE REST GRANT AND- IN METRO COSTS. ARE ARE. CHARTER OUR BUDGET. AND THE- SO FAR HAS HAS BEEN SUPPORTED. SIGNIFICANTLY THAT. IT'S GONNA EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS WHILE ADDRESSING OUR EQUITY GAPS WE JUST SPOKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. IT'S GOING TO INVEST IN ENHANCING CLIMATE RESILIENCE RESEARCH AND REVITALIZED THAT IN NORTHERN NORTH COAST ECONOMY. MY THIRD- ELEMENT I WANTED TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NOW YOUR MEMBERS ARE BUDGET REQUEST INCLUDED- I REQUEST FOR RECURRING FUNDING. FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPITAL NEEDS OF UNIVERSITY. AND THIS SPRING BECAUSE OF THE- THE AMOUNT OF ONE TIME FUNDING THAT WE SAW COMING AVAILABLE. WE SHIFTED TO A APPROACH OF REQUESTING A ONE TIME FUNDING WHICH WE THINK WOULD BE A MUCH MUCH MORE- ACHIEVABLE. THE WAY THAT THE STATE IS LINED UP. SO FIRST WE WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS PROPOSAL- GET BOTH TO YOU STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS TO ADDRESS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. BUT WE ALSO WERE GONNA URGE YOU AS LEGISLATOR ADDED ADDITIONAL EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION WE'VE THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM. FROM THE CSU ALL SPRING HERE. OF ADDITIONAL NEEDS THAT WE THINK THAT THE STATE. WOULD BE. WE THINK WOULD BE A GOOD INVESTMENT IN THE IN THE UNIVERSITY. WHAT THAT'LL DO IS THAT'LL HELP US ELIMINATE A BIG CHUNKS OF OUR BACKLOG OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. WILL ALSO HELP WITH ENROLLMENTS- SOME OF OUR HOUSING NEEDS OWNERS CAMPUSES AS WELL AS AIR RECIRCULATION UPGRADES AS WE KNOW FROM COVE IT. AND SOME OTHER VITAL PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE SO THAT'S THE THAT TO TALLY OF MY OPENING COMMENTS IN A- BIG WAY THROUGH THE CSU DISCUSSION. OKAY THANK YOU. THE OPEN UP TO FURTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. I ASKED EARLIER- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BEFORE YOU GOT ON THERE RYAN- WHERE WE'RE GIVING YOU A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND GO AND SAY A BLANK CHECK WITHOUT ANY TARGET FOR ENROLLMENT AT SAID THAT CONCERN FOR US JUST LIKE I TOLD. YOU SEE EARLIER TODAY SO- WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT YOU THESE ARE YOUR PRIORITIES BUT THEY DON'T REFLECT OUR PRIORITIES THAT WE HEAR. AND GRANTED YOU'RE YOU SAY YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE EXISTING STUDENTS HAVE A GOOD EXPERIENCE AT THE CSU. BUT RIGHT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE YOU KNOW LITTLE BROTHER AND SISTER. AND COUSINS AND NEIGHBORS AND LITTLE LEAGUE TEAMMATES SINCE HIGH SCHOOL CLASSMATES GET INTO. SO HOW ARE GOING TO HELP THEM. ALL RIGHT WELL WELL FIRST AND FOREMOST- IF YOU LOOK AT OUR BUDGET REQUEST THAT WE'VE BEEN SHARING SINCE LAST FALL. REALLY THE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENT OF THIS IS THE GRANT INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. NOW THE REAL KEY HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR CURRENT STUDENTS- CAN IF THEY CHOOSE TO TAKE FIFTEEN UNITS- TERM- IT'S GONNA REQUIRE A LONG TERM INVESTMENT. THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO INVEST D. D. THE LATEST TRANCHE IN THE CURRENT YEAR REMEMBER BACK LAST YEAR. IN IN ADVANCE OF THE OF THE KOBE BUDGET THERE IS A DECIDED A DECISION TO REDUCE THE UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET WE WEREN'T ABLE TO INVEST BRANDING FUNDING. IN GRAD OF THEIR- SO WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS DOING WITH THIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IS ALLOWING US TO COVER FIRST THOSE MANDATORY COSTS AND THEN FULLY FINE GRADUATION SHOULD. THAT'S GONNA ALLOW US TO MAKE UP FOR LAST YEAR THAN INVEST FOR THE NEXT YEAR. SO THAT CAN ALLOW MORE STUDENTS TO TAKE MORE COURSES THAT THEY CAN GRADUATING MORE TIME THE WA THERE'S GOING TO BE A BETTER THROUGHPUT. WHICH WILL CREATE MORE NATURAL ROOM SO TO SPEAK. BUT I WILL ECHO THE- COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM YOU SEE SAY OVER TEN AND- AND SAY THAT ABOUT THE BEYOND THAT IS WHEN WE TALK WHEN WE WHEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT ENROLLMENT GROWTH. NOW IN OUR CASE. THAT STATE WOULD NEED TO ADD ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS. PER STUDENT. IN ORDER TO GROW ENROLLMENT. AND WE THINK FOUNDED FOUNDATIONAL A WE NEED TO INVEST FULLY IN THE GRADUATION AND SHIP AND IT'S NOT ONLY JUST FOR BEDFORD BETTER THROUGHPUT. BUT IT'S ADDITIONAL- SUPPORT IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THOSE EQUITY GAPS THAT HAVE BANNED AT ALL OF ARE. AT THE FOREFRONT OF ALL OF OUR MINDS. SO I THINK YOU GOT IT. I THINK FUNDED FUNDAMENTALLY YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITY AND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE WHICH IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL MONEY TO ADD ON TOP OF THAT. WE AGREED THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GROW AND ROLLED. WE HAVE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES WE HAVE A LOT OF CAPACITY PHYSICAL CAPACITY THAT WE CAN STILL FILL WITH ADDITIONAL STUDENTS THAT THE HARD PART IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES IN ORDER TO HIRE THOSE FACULTY IN THE SUPPORT. FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE. I KNOW THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A SATISFACTORY ANSWER FOR YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY FROM THE FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF WHY DON'T WE JUST GET OUT OF THERE. BUT WORK WORK WE'RE STAYING TRIED AND TRUE WITH OUR BUDGET REQUEST THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD. AS AND GET AS A CHANCER HAS PURSUED AND AS AS EXPRESSED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS ARE OUR HIGHEST PARTIES THE GRADUATION AND SHIP. THEN ABOVE ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT WE CAN GO TO ENROLLMENT GROWTH. YEAH AND THE AND THAT LEADS TO MY OTHER QUESTION SO. WE DON'T HAVE- FULLY FUNDING FOR THE. GRADUATION INITIATIVE HERE CORRECT. BUT WE DO HAVE A- WE DO HAVE IT BUT YOU HAVE. IN THE- IN THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL IS OUR ABILITY TO FULLY FUND THE GRADUATION SHOULD. SO IF YOU TAKE HIM OUT THAT WAS PROPOSED IN JANUARY ADDED THE SEVENTY FOUR POINT FOUR THAT IS PROPOSED TO BE REVISION. WE CAN'T FULLY FUND THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. OKAY IF THERE'S ANYTHING LESS THAN THAT WE CAN'T DO IT. GOTCHA SO WHAT WE HAVE IN THE MAY REVISE ALLOWS YOU TO FULLY IMPLEMENT. THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND- THAT'S- NOT AYE AS YOU KNOW I. WE BOTH WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU WANT TO EXPAND. ENROLLMENT SLOTS. BESIDES FUNDING IN ROMAN MORE SLEEP AND MORE SLOTS THAT THAT THE OTHER THING THAT. YOU COULD DO AND MAYBE YOUR BIGGER BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IS TO. HELP THE EXISTING FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CSU STUDENTS. GRADUATE WITHIN FOUR YEARS OR FOUR PLUS AND NOT. LINGER. FOR MULTIPLE YEARS AFTER- SO EVERY ELSE THAT WERE PUT HERE FOR POLY TAC IN NORTHRIDGE AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF IS. IS GOOD FOR HIGHER ED BUT IF WE REALLY WANT TO ADDRESS THE KEY ISSUE. AND HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESS AND- AND FRANKLY WE LOCKED LOOK AT AFFORDABILITY LOOK AT THE DEBT CRISIS WHICH WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT LATER WOULD STILL NEED COMMISSION. THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE IS THAT IS THAT IS THE NUMBER ONE YOU KNOW. LINK BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS. OKAY THAT'S IT FOR NOW QUESTIONS MISTER- O'DONNELL BY A DENTIST AND MEDINA. THANK YOU- AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS BROACHED I WAS OUT OF THE ROOM FOR A MOMENT AGO. UP IN CLASS INSTRUCTION IN CLASS. CLASSES ARE ON A LABEL IT. BACK AT THE CAMPUS NOT ONLINE THAT'S THE PLAN FOR NEXT YEAR IS THAT ACCURATE. THAT'S GENERALLY THE PLAN RIGHT- OBVIOUSLY I THINK LIKE ALL OF US IN ALL OF OUR RESPECTIVE CAPACITIES IT'S ALL GONNA DEPEND ON HOW THE DISEASE PROGRESSES GOING FORWARD. AS OF RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING IS LOOKING GOOD SO- I WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN CAUTIOUSLY MOVING TOWARDS OPENING MORE AND MORE COURSE SECTIONS IN PERSON AS WE GO FORWARD- AND- OBVIOUSLY THE IDEA HERE IS. A LONGER TERM IS TO BE ABLE TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF BALANCING RIGHT. LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BUT ALSO OFFERING COURSES THAT ARE HYBRIDS AND MARK MORE COURSES THAT ARE ON THAT ARE FULLY ONLINE. GIVES A STUDENTS FAR MORE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF THEIR SCHEDULING AND THEIR ABILITY TO MANAGE WORK LIFE EXPERIENCES BUT YES I THINK FOR THE UPCOMING FALL OUR GOAL IS TO GET AS MANY COURSES WE CAN'T FOR MINE. IT'S ALL DEPEND ALSO ON ALL THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL- REQUIREMENTS BY LOCAL. HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS WELL. I AND I GET THE HOW REQUIRE AND AGREE THAT THEY NEED BE ACCOMMODATED. BUT I DON'T I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF AND FOR OTHERS IN THE ROOM FEEL THE SAME THAT. A YOU NEED TO MOVE BACK ON CAMPUS. AND FALL IF THINGS KEEP GOING IN THE DIRECTION THEY'RE GOING. I WALK THROUGH LONG BEACH STATE WHEN I'M HOME. JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY. AND THE PRAISE THE PLACES PRETTY DESOLATE THERE'S SOME STUFF GOING ON THERE NOW. BUT IT'S PRETTY DESOLATE IT'S A LARGE CAMPUS WITH- A LOT OF FACILITIES IN THEIR EMPTY IT'S RATHER TRAGIC TO SEE AND I KNOW YOU AGREE WITH ME. BUT AGAIN I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT- WE NEED TO GET STUDENTS BACK. TO THE CAMPUS IN THE FALL IN THE FALL. IF THINGS KEEP HEADING THAT DIRECTION. THEY'RE HEADING. AND ALSO ONE OTHER TOPICS THE SHARK LAB LONG BEACH STATE THAT'S INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN ACTUALLY. LOCALLY FAMOUS AS WELL- DR LAW THE SHARK LAB SHARK WEEK HE'S ON THERE ALL THE TIME- IT'S NOT ALWAYS FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES QUITE FRANKLY IT'S FOR SCIENCE PURPOSES. THAT'S WHERE HE COMES FROM- AND WHEN Y. ESPECIALLY CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A LOT MORE SHARK ACTIVITY ALONG OUR SHORE. WHEN I WAS A KID GOING OUT TO THE BEACH IN LONG BEACH. WE NEVER SAW A SEALED WE NEVER SAW A DOLPHIN WE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF A SHARK. NOW THERE ARE SEALS NOW THERE ARE DOLPHINS AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY SHARKS WHAT WE HAVE TO CALL THE KIDS OUT OF THE WATER. AND WHAT WE NEED TO STUDY THOSE A DOCTOR LOW. OUT OF THE SHARK LAB HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF THAT WE GOT AND WE GOT AN ALLOCATION ABOUT FOUR FIVE YEARS AGO. AND WHAT I'M SEEKING TO DO THIS YEAR'S CONTINUE- GETTING MONEY TO THE SHARK LAB SO IT CAN CONTINUE. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SAFE WATERS WE UNDERSTAND SHARK BEHAVIOR. SHARKS ARE PART OF OUR ECOSYSTEM IT ALSO SPEAKS TO OUR ECONOMY TO. THE USE OF PEOPLE START HEARING ABOUT SHARK ALERTS ALONG OUR SHORELINE. THAT COME GOING TO COME TO OUR BEACHES TO VISIT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SPEND MONEY IN SUPPORT THE TOWNS. ALONG THE BEACHES AND WE NEED THAT TO HAPPEN. SO I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SHARK LAB. TO CALIFORNIA YES THE WORLD BUT REALLY CALIFORNIA FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. AND THAT THEY'RE DOING REALLY IMPORTANT WORK THERE ARE CUTTING EDGE WORK. HOW THE HOW THEY IDENTIFY WHEN SHARKS ARE COMING NEAR THE WATER. AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN ALERT US SO THAT WE. CAN- YOUR PARTNER OKAY. YOU'RE RIGHT- IN IN AND SHE THAT OUR WILL SOURCE. WE DON'T TO SCAN THE OLD THE SEVENTIES WHAT KILLED. THAT WAS THE ANSWER THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER ANYMORE. AND DR LOWE WITH HIS EDUCATION. IS OPPORTUNITIES CRITICAL SHARK LOVER MAKING THAT HAPPEN SO WITH THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY THANK YOU SO MEMBER BY IT OUT OF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE KEEPS ON SAYING THAT THEY'RE OPEN TO AN OF THE AROMA CONVERSATION- BUT THEY ALSO PREVIOUSLY INDICATED THAT THEIR PLANNING A NEW. COMPACT AGREEMENT CONVERSATION- WITH THE SEGMENTS POSSIBLY FOR THE FALL SO THE TIMING DOESN'T REALLY WORK WELL FOR THE BUDGET SO CAN YOU JUST PROVIDE SOME CLARITY ON YOUR TIMELINE. BUDGET PROCESS YOU KNOW. THE I JUST THINK WE NEED MORE CLARITY HERE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND GENEROUSLY WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AS MY COLLEAGUE HAD MENTIONED AND- THE CONVERSATIONS ARE- GOING TO BE ENGAGING WITH- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ND CSU. AND AND SO IT WILL BE. A CONCURRENTLY AS WE MOVE FOR WITH THE WITH THE BUDGET PROCESS. SO THEN THOSE CONVERSATIONS SHOULD BE HAPPENING. ARE THEY HAPPENING NOW. I WILL DEFER TO MY AND MY- I WILL DEFERRED AND MANAGEMENT ON A SPECIFIC DETAILS BUT I DO KNOW THAT- IN ORDER TO NECESSITATE THOSE CONVERSATIONS- WE WILL DEFINITELY AT NEED TO HAVE- CERTIFICATION WITH THE UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIANS YES YOU. GOT STILL MIGHT A SECOND QUESTION HERE- IS ACTUALLY ON THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NATIONAL HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION. H. ASIDE. EQUITY INNOVATION HUB THAT CSU NORTHRIDGE MY ALMA MATER. ACCORDING TO SEE THROUGH THE FACILITY WILL BUILD UPON THE FOUNDATIONAL WORK OF SEASONS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE. ON THE CENTERS FOR POSSIBILITIES PROJECT THE FACILITY FACILITY WILL PROVIDE A CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH AND COLLABORATIVE LEARNING AND SERVE AS A HUB. TO BRINGING THE COMMUNITY AND P. K. FOURTEEN. PARTNERS TOGETHER TO FACILITATE NEW EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS IT'S SLATED TO OPEN IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THIS INVESTMENT WOULD ACCELERATE THE CAMPUS IS ABILITY TO ADDRESS PERSISTENT GAPS AND DEGREE. ATTAINMENT AND DIVERSE REPRESENTATION IN STEM CAREERS AND- I'M HOPING IT'S ALSO STEAM CAREERS BECAUSE- IN HOLLYWOOD ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IS A BIG FIELD IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- AND THAT THE FULL CAPACITY. THE HUBBLE SERVICE A NATIONAL MODEL FOR ACCELERATING STUDENTS SUCCESS FOR DIVERSE LEARNERS AND HSI'S ACROSS THE NATION AS I MENTIONED I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW WHOLLY APPROPRIATE AND EXCITING. BUT I AM A LITTLE CURIOUS AS TO WHY- GIVEN THAT SEASON'S WORK ON THE CENTER FOR POSSIBILITIES PROJECT OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. WHY A THIS PART IDENTIFY AND THE CSU FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I WITH THE SEC THE CSU NORTHRIDGE THEM EQUITY CENTER IS- CAPEN CAMPUS REQUEST- AND- AND SO THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THEM AS IT IS A REQUEST FROM THE FROM THE CAMPUS- WE CONCUR THAT THE CAMPUS IS WELL POSITIONED TO HOUSE THE EQUITY CENTER AND- IN AND SPPORT AND MENTOR UNDERGRADS INTO THE SAME FIELD. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO FURTHER NOTES THAT NORTHRIDGE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH A PRIVATE INVESTOR ON THIS PROPOSAL AND HAS A SOFT COMMITMENT FOR OPERATIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE PROJECT AS WELL AS SIMILARLY A WEST COAST HAVE SIMILAR. TO THE ATLANTA PROPEL CENTER. GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MEDINA THANK YOU SO I HAVE A TWO QUESTIONS TO CSU THE FIRST WIND PICKS UP WHERE MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH- LEFT OFF I MET A COUPLE WEEKENDS AGO WITH THE CONSTITUENTS. OF MOTHER AND FATHER WHO HAVE A STUDENT AT AT CAL STATE LONG BEACH SHE'S A FRESHMAN THERE- AND HAS LIVED IN THE DORMS ALL YEAR LONG EVEN WHILE CLASSES HAVE BEEN ONLINE- AND RELATIVELY OUT OF A GOOD EXPERIENCE THIS PAST YEAR. BUT WHEN SHE WENT TO REGISTER FOR CLASSES FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR FOR THE NEXT TERM. SHE SHE FOUND THAT FOR CLASSES FOR THE NEXT TERM WOULD BE AGAIN ONLINE. SO HERE SHE IS SECOND. YEAR STUDENT AT CAL STATE LONG BEACH% AND SHE HAD THIS. TO FIND EVEN ONE CLASS- THAT WAS GOING TO MEET IN PERSON AND SO THE- YOU KNOW THEIR CONCERN THEY HAVE A NO STUDENT- OUT AS- AND WAS ABLE AT- NORTHERN ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY TO CONTINUE THE WHOLE YEAR- IN PERSON. SO I STRONGLY CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM LONG BEACH I WANT TO URGE. CSU TO PROVIDE AS MANY CLASSES AS THEY CAN IN PERSON- NOW WE'RE GOING INTO THE SECOND HERE. AND I THINK THAT STUDENTS WOULD BE GREATLY SHORT CHANGED IS THERE A COLLEGE EXPERIENCE- WAS NOT MORE IN PERSON I THINK THAT WE KNOW AS I KNOW. AS AN EDUCATOR. THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN COLLEGE IN THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE IS NOT JUST WHAT HAPPENS IN CLASS AND CERTAINLY WHAT HAPPENS IN CLASS WHEN IT'S ONLINE IS MUCH DIFFERENT. FROM IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BUT ALSO THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO MIX. AND EXCHANGE IDEAS- WHETHER IT BE ON CAMPUS OR IN THEIR DORMS. AND SO VERY MUCH WANT TO- URGE. CSU TO OFFER AS MANY CLASSES- IN THE NEXT TERM- IN PERSON. AND HOPE THAT WE CAN SEE THAT- NEXT YEAR AND THEN CERTAINLY ALL OF OUR- CONSTITUENTS. IN OURSELVES WILL BE BE WATCHING. OKAY THANK ANY ADVICE QUESTION- TO CSU. WE SAW LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR SIGNED- LEGISLATION A DOCTOR WEBER IS BILL TO- MAKE ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENT FOR GRADUATION- I BELIEVE IT'S ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED OR WILL BE IMPLEMENTED- FOR GRADUATION AND THEN THE NEXT NEXT TERM SO MY QUESTION TO CSU IS THERE FUNDING- IS THERE FUNDING OR THE BEEN REQUEST FOR FUNDING- TO- COVER THE COST OF OFFERING THOSE CLASSES. TO CSU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA- ALL ALL TALK ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES ABOUT REAL QUICKLY IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFICS ON THE LONG BEACH SITUATION I WOULD HAVE TO. TALK TO THE CAMPUS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT- MY SUSPICION THOUGH IS A LOT LIKE WHERE WE ABANDONED ALL OF US IN OUR RESPECTIVE LIVES WHERE PLANNING IS FOR ONE THING AND WHAT MATERIALIZES IS A DIFFERENT THING THAT THAT HAPPENS SO FOR EXAMPLE IN MY OWN PERSONAL LIFE I HAVE KIDS THAT STARTED THE WHOLE YEAR FULLY ONLINE AND AS AS THINGS. LOOSENED UP. TO ATTEND IN PERSON RIGHT. SO I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THIS STUDENTS EXPERIENCE OF REGISTERING AND FINDING ONLY FOR COURSES OR OR OR THREE WHATEVER THE NUMBER WAS. BEING FULLY ONLINE I WOULD IMAGINE THAT WITH THE URGENCY OF ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES WHITES AND RE OPEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST. FOR THE STATE EXPERIENCE BUT FACULTY AND STAFF I WANT TO RETURN AS WELL AS SOON AS WE CAN. BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THOSE THOSE COURSES WELL SOME OF THEM WILL BE THEN CONVERTED AND BECOME- IN PERSON. AS TIME PERMITS AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE FALL AND THINGS LOOK LIKE THEY CAN BE MORE OPEN AND THAT SORT OF THING SO I WOULD THINK THAT. AS TRENDS ARE GOING RIGHT NOW I WOULD IMAGINE THAT. DISTANCE EXPERIENCE MAY BE THAT YOU KNOW WATER TO THOSE CLASSES MAY ULTIMATELY BE. UP OUT IN PERSON BUT- BUT- I CAN MAKING INSURANCE ABOUT THAT BUT I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE THE TREND THAT WE'RE HEADING DOWN TOWARDS. AND OF COURSE I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT BEING FULLY ONLINE I'D RATHER BE IN THE BUILDING WITH YOU TALKING AS WELL RATHER THAN OVER THIS AND NOT HAVING MY MIKE WORKING WELL. SO IT YES I THINK THAT'S EVERYBODY'S ANGLE HERE IS TO TRY TO BE BACK IN PERSON SUCH AS POSSIBLE. ON THE IN THE TERMS OF ETHNIC STUDIES- WHAT WE DID IN OUR FALL REQUEST AS WE INCORPORATED- SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- FOR THE COST OF FULLY IMPLEMENTING ETHNIC STUDIES. INTO OUR MANDATORY COST CATEGORY OF FUNDING. AND BY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSING IN JANUARY. THE ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR GENERAL OPERATING COSTS FOR UNIVERSITY. OUR FIRST CALL ABOUT MONEY ARE MANDATORY COSTS AND SO THAT'S A LONG WAY BASICALLY SAYING. IF THIS PROPOSAL HOLDS IT WE HAVE THIS TYPE OF DISCRETION PEOPLE USE THAT MONEY WE WILL BE FULLY FUNDING THE ETHNIC STUDIES. REQUIREMENT IN GETTING THAT FUNDING OUT TO CAMPUSES SO THEY CAN. IMPLEMENT THAT ACROSS THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THERE WAS SOME TALK ABOUT HUMBOLDT I DON'T BLAME THEM FOR WANTING TO BE AT AT POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY- CAL POLY POMONA ONE OF OUR PREMIER UNIVERSITIES- HERE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WE'RE VERY PROUD OF WHAT THEY'VE DONE ONE OF THE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY USER TRANSFER PROGRAM. FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TRANSFERRING TO THE CSU'S IN THIS DISCRETIONARY FUNDING THE BASE AUGMENTATION IS THERE A PLAN TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT IS BEING USED FOR THE TRANSFER PROGRAM. JENNIFER YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WANTED SPEECH BUT I CAN I CAN I CAN TAKE THE FIRST CRACK IF YOU LIKE- BUT BUT BASICALLY I WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW OUR OUR BUDGET REQUEST AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS FUNDING IS NOT FOR NEW ENROLLMENT SO EVERY YEAR- WHAT WE DO THOUGH IS WE HAVE A BALLOTS WE HAVE BEEN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS TO THE UNIVERSITY ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND OF OUR NEW ENROLLEES EVERY YEAR OUR TRANSFERS. AND ART AND THE TREND THAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING SINCE THE ORIGIN OF THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER IS THAT MORE AND MORE OF OUR EIGHTY STUDENTS MORE AND MORE OF OUR TRANSFER STUDENTS ARE AT T. STUDENTS I BELIEVE ABOUT HALF OF OUR TRANSFER STUDENTS AT THIS POINT ARE AT T. STUDENTS. SO I WOULD SAY FROM THAT VANTAGE POINT- THAT FROM YOUR QUESTION NO THERE'S NO NEW FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL TRANSFERS AND LAST YOU DECIDE AS THE ASSEMBLY AND THE AND THE SENATE AND THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR TO COME TOGETHER AND ADD TO WHAT ROLE- THERE'S NO NEW FUNDING DEDICATED FOR MORE TRANSFERS AT THIS POINT IF YOU GROWING ROLE THAT- WE WILL OBVIOUSLY ABOUT HALF OF THOSE STUDENTS WILL BE COMING IN AS TRANSFERRED TO THE WILL BE ABLE TO ENROLL. ADDITIONAL TRANSFER STUDENTS BUT IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE TRANSFERS I THINK WE'RE WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THE TO DO WITH THE DIRECTION WHICH THINGS ARE GOING- SPECIALLY WITH THE FACT THAT SO MANY STUDENTS ARE PREPARING WITH TWO YEARS OF EXPERIENCE ONLY A COMMUNITY COLLEGES COMING TO OUR INSTITUTION WITH TWO YEARS- ROUGHLY PLAN TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE SO WE'RE REALLY HAPPY WITH THIS FACT THAT STUDENTS THAT WE ARE RECEIVING STUDENTS AT THE SCENE ISSUE. THAT ARE- CREDIT READY TO BE ABLE. TO COMPLETE IN TWO YEARS IF THEY SO CHOOSE. WONDERFUL A IT BUT ANOTHER ONE OF CAN- CO SAMBAR DINO- I THINK THAT THEY- AGAIN GOING BACK TO INCREASING A MOMENT LOOKING AT EQUITY- SPECIFICALLY. THE ENROLLMENT AND AGAIN VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT INCREASING. MINORITY STUDENT ENROLLMENT. I'M VERY PROUD OF ALL THE WORK THAT THEY DO IT CAL STATE SAMPOERNA DINO.% IN IN IN BEING SO INTENTIONAL ABOUT BRINGING IN A SPECIALLY OUR STUDENTS. FROM THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. SO MY QUESTION AND IT GOES BACK TO WHAT WAS ASKED EARLIER THE CHAIR ASKED ABOUT THIS- WITH THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND NO. NO NO NO ONE MOMENT TARGET. WHAT IS IT THAT CSU NEEDS TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT AND OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO BE MONEY WHAT SPECIFICALLY WHAT IS IT THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO DO THIS AND HOW WOULD YOU WHAT IS IT THAT YOU NEED AND HOW WOULD YOU THEN- INCREASE ENROLLMENT. THE QUESTION WELL- I WOULD SAY WE DON'T NEED ANYTHING OTHER THAN FUNDING- WE HAVE CAPACITY ON ON OUR CAMPUSES TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE PHYSICAL CAPACITY TO ACCOMMODATE- ADDITIONAL STUDENTS SO WE HAVE THE LAB SPACES WE HAVE THE LECTURE HALLS WE HAVE THE SMALLER CLASSROOMS WE CAN DO THAT. WE ALSO IN TERMS OF ENROLLMENT WE ALSO ARE LARGE AND REFLECT THE CALIFORNIA- DEMOGRAPHICS- WE HAVE A LARGE- LET NEXT POPULATION THAT REFLECTS THE POPULATION WRIT LARGE ENOUGH OF YOUNGER CALIFORNIANS SO IN TERMS OF THE DIVERSITY AT THE UNIVERSITY I THINK PREPARE. APART PERSPECTIVE I THINK REALLY WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO IS ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN OFFER MORE SLOT SO TO SPEAK TO STUDENTS ARE VARIOUS CAMPUSES. I WILL SAY THAT- ON ON THE ENROLLMENT. OF THINGS- THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE GOING ARE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES. THERE'S A LOT OF DEMAND AT THAT THERE. AND IN SOME OF OUR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES DEMAND HAS SOFTENED A BIT. AND SO OUR PRIORITY WOULD BE TO OBVIOUSLY PUT IN SLOTS TO SPEAK TO THE PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE. THERE IS GREAT DEMAND SO YOU'RE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES WILL LIKELY BE THE- RECIPIENT OF MORE OF THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH IF YOU WERE TO ADD ENROLLMENT AND THAT'S SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE STUDENTS LIVE AND THAT'S WHERE THEY WANT TO ATTEND. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING SOME OF OUR CAMPUS IS BUSTING AT THE SEAMS. I WILL SAY THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS YOU COULD DO ACTUALLY FROM A FROM A- BUDGETARY PERSPECTIVE FIRST IS. FUNDING HAS TO BE RECURRING. IT CANNOT BE ONE TIME FUNDING. RECURRING REQUIRES US TO HIRE FACULTY THAT WE'RE GOING TO COMMIT TO FOR THIRTY YEARS OF THEIR CAREER AND STAFF THAT WILL BE WITH US FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR CAREERS. THE OTHER THING TOO IS THAT IF YOU WERE TO PROVIDE US A LOT OF FUNDING FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH. IN AN BEGINNING JULY FIRST WE'VE ALREADY MADE A LOT OF ENROLLMENT DECISIONS. FOR THIS FALL SO IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MEET SOME SORT OF ENROLLMENT EXPECTATIONS. IN THE IMMEDIATE FISCAL YEAR THAT WERE RECEIVING THE FUNDING FOR. WE WILL OBVIOUSLY BE ABLE TO OFFER MORE ENROLLMENT TO- TRANSFERS IN SPRING AT CERTAIN CAMPUSES. BUT I THINK YOU'RE- THE WAY YOU SHOULD STRUCTURE IT AND IT'S BEEN STRUCTURE LIKE THIS TO YOU SEE WHEN IT WHEN YOU SEE A PROCEDURAL GROWTH. IS CREATE AN EXPECTATION FOR US TO BEAT THAT NEW TARGET. FOR THE NEXT YEAR FOR THE END OF THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE YEAR BUT ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO. THOROUGHLY RECRUIT FACULTY FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO EDUCATE OUR STUDENTS THE BEST. THERE'S A COUPLE OF OTHER ITEMS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO. PROBABLY TOUCH ON BUT IT BETTER NOT BECAUSE THAT TIME YOU'VE GOT YOUR ONLY TWO ISSUES AND IF YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO MANY MORE TO GO SO MAYBE I SHOULD STOP THERE. BUT I HAVE A LONG LONG HOME PHONE. THINGS THAT. TECHNICALLY WOULD BE GOOD. YOU KNOW YOUR STAFF FOR OUR- WELL AWARE OF THOSE AND I CAN WORK WITH THEM IN TERMS OF THAT. THAT MECHANICS IN THE BUDGET. WE'LL LET YOU FROM. I'M SORRY. SUMMARY MAYBE JUST A FOLLOW UP ON HURT PER QUESTION JUST REMIND US. IN SO WE HAVE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES SUMMER IMPACTED. HE SAID EARLIER. LONG BEACH POLAR TEN SAN DIEGO. SAN LUIS OBISPO I THINK THOSE THE MAIN ONES. AND HOW MANY STUDENTS AND IF YEARS AGO WE SET A POLICY THAT IF YOU APPLY TO THE CSU AND DONT GET IN. THE AUTOMATICALLY GET ACCEPTED TO ANOTHER CSU AND IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL. HOW MANY STUDENTS APPLY TO THE CSU. AND DON'T GET IN TO A CAMPUS. RIGHT I THINK THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE WITH- WITH THAT ISSUE ABOUT STUDENTS IS THAT THEY ARE FOR THE THAT POPULATION WE'RE pSTUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN BEEN DEEMED CSU ELIGIBLE. TO THERE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO APPLY TO ANY UNIVERSITY THAT OUR DON'T MEET THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS RIGHT TO SET THOSE FOLKS ASSIGNED OR NOT ADMISSIBLE TO UNIVERSITY. SO THE SUPPORT FOCUSED ON THOSE WHO ARE CSU ELIGIBLE AND MAYBE THEY'VE APPLIED AT SAN LUIS OBISPO ONLY OR SAN DIEGO STATE- RIGHT WHICH ARE VERY POPULAR CAMPUSES OF OURS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET INTO BECAUSE THERE'S JUST A LOT TO ME RIGHT. SO WE SEE ISSUE HAVE BEEN COMMITTED A REDIRECTION POLICY BASED ON THE PRODDING OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR. TO DEVELOP A REDIRECTION POLICY NOW BEFORE THE REDIRECTION POLICY WE HAD ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY TO THIRTY THOUSAND CSU ELIGIBLE STUDENTS THAT WOULD APPLY THAT COULD NOT RECEIVE A SPOT AT THE UNIVERSITY RIGHT TO HELP ME AND MANY OF THEM LIKE I SAID REPLYING TO MANY OF OUR OUR VERY POPULAR CAMPUSES. SO WHAT WE DO OFFER THEM THOSE TWENTY TO THIRTY THOUSAND PER YEAR WE OFFER THEM A SPOT AT A SECOND OR THIRD OPTION UNIVERSITY WHAT WE TYPICALLY DO IS EVERY YEAR WE GO THROUGH AND WE SURVEY OUR CAMPUSES AND LOOK AT THEIR LOOK AT THEIR SITUATION ASK COULD YOU TAKE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS. ON YOUR CAMPUS- FOR EXAMPLE WE WOULD DIRECT REDIRECT THEM TO SOME OF OUR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES ASSEMBLY CISCO STATE CINEMA STATE ARE EXAMPLES OF CAMPUSES THAT HAVE SOFTER ENROLLMENT BUT WOULD BE OPEN TO OFFERING MORE SPOTS ARE. OFFERING STUDENTS A SPOT AT THEIR UNIVERSITY NOW WE OFFER STUDENTS TO MAKE A CHOICE ABOUT. WHAT THEIR SECOND THIRD WOULD BE. AND WE ALSO FOR OF THE STUDENTS WE DENY ADMISSION TO. WEEKS THE IF WE ENOUGH FROM THEM WHATSOEVER JUST TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE TO GO IN HIGHER EDUCATION. OF FOR THE MOST PART- WE END UP HAPPENING AFTER AFTER ALL GETS DOWN TO BOIL DOWN. OUR EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE ABOUT BETWEEN SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS ACTUALLY TAKE US UP ON OUR OFFER. AND THEY SAY OKAY I DO WANT TO GO TO THAT OTHER C. ISSUE I COULDN'T GET INTO SAN DIEGO BUT I'LL GO OVER. AND I'LL GO ATTEND CINEMA I'LL DO THAT. AND THEY TAKE US UP ON THAT OFFER. THE OTHER THING- I'LL POINT OUT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY IS THAT. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE- WHERE STUDENTS APPLIED. AND BEEN DECIDED NOT TO BE RESPONSIVE TO US. IT'S OFTEN STUDENTS THAT HAVE APPLIED ONLY TO SLOW. OR ONLY THE SAN DIEGO BUT THEY'VE ALSO APPLIED TO A NUMBER OF C. ISSUE ARE UC'S. WHERE THEY'VE APPLIED TO OTHER PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS AND OPTED TO GO TO THOSE OTHER INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN ADMITTED THERE. SO THE BOY AT THE BOTTOM LINE ON REDIRECTION IS THAT ANYWHERE BETWEEN SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS ARE TAKING US-UP ON OUR OFFER. AND WE OFFER A SPOTTED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE CSU ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. THAT IS DENIED IF THEIR FIRST CHOICE CAMPUS. SO THE CHALLENGES REALLY EITHER EXPANDING ACCESS TO THE COVETED CAMPUSES SIMILAR TO WHAT. WE SEE AT UC. OR TO MAKE THE OTHER CAMPUSES. MARKUP IT LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND HUMBOLDT OR- IN SOME THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CSU SO. THAT'S RIGHT OKAY I THINK WE WENT AROUND AROUND ON THIS SO- THIS IS STILL A PRIORITY FOR US TO HAVE SOME SOME TYPE OF ENROLLMENT TARGET FOR THE QUESTIONS ON CSU AB SINGH NINE WILL HOLD THESE ISSUES OPEN AND- PROCEED NOW WITH OUR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. HELLO DAN HAD OR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO I PLAN TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW ON COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROPOSALS FOR THE MAYOR VISION AND THEN IT HAPPENED ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE- THAT A HIGH LEVEL ACROSS THE THREE YEAR BUDGET WINDOW THE MAY REVISION REFLECTS JUST OVER ONE POINT FIVE BILLION.

OUT THERE THAT IS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD- WE'LL SEE FUNDS DIRECTLY GOING TO SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS A RESULT OF THE STATE OF CORPORATION PLANET- I DON'T I DON'T THE PLAN NUMBER BUT- I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE ABOUT SIXTEEN BILLION WITH. HALF GOING TO TAXPAYERS AND% HALF GOING TO SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES I WITH THAT THANK YOU TO BE ABLE I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AFTER MY COLLEAGUES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO PRESENT OKAY THANK YOU L. L. THANK YOU DIDN'T. POLICY NOW AND THE- ANALYST'S OFFICE. I'LL THE CATCH ON A FEW OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IN TERMS OF DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THE DECISIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE- OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS FIRST WE SEE IT AS A POSITIVE- IN MAY REVISE THE PROPOSAL TO RETIRE ALL THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE DEFERRALS IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE PROVE THAT. OUR MESSAGE ON FUNDING TO ADDRESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS VERY SIMILAR TO THE MESSAGE THAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON THE UNIVERSITIES BUDGETS. WE THINK IT HAS A PARENT AND WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU TREAT THEM A REVISED PROPOSALS. ARE THOSE UNDING LEVELS AS A MINIMUM GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE COLLEGES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG WHICH IS WELL OVER. ONE BILLION DOLLARS. THE LEGISLATURE COULD FREE UP FUNDS TO ADDRESS EVEN MORE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. OR OTHER COST PRESSURES THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE FACING SUCH AS PENSIONS BY REJECTING THOSE BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE DEEMS UNJUSTIFIED OR OTHERWISE LOWER PRIORITY. WE IDENTIFIED- SOME OF THOSE PROPOSALS WE THINK ARE GOOD CANDIDATES- AT THE FEBRUARY HEARINGS ON JANUARY PROPOSALS AND WE'VE SHARED WITH STAFF OTHER WHAT WE THINK ARE GOOD CANDIDATES FOR REJECTION BY THE LEGISLATURE REDIRECTION OF THE MONEY. WE SURE THAT WAS STAFF AND I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS IT KERN HEARING IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. IN TERMS OF ON GOING SPENDING THE LARGEST PROPOSAL COVERS THAT 4% COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THE APPORTIONMENT. AND WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THAT'LL HELP THE COLLEGES ADDRESS RISING SALARY BENEFITS OTHER COST PRESSURES. THE MAY REVISE PROVIDES A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR OTHER OR OTHER TYPE OF BASIS AUGMENTATION FOR SOME CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS- THE PERCENTAGE VARIES FROM ONE POINT 7% 24% 25% YOU SEE THAT ON PAGE TEN OF YOUR AGENDA. A NUMBER OF- COMMUNICATIVE. PROGRAMS HOWEVER WOULD NOT RECEIVE A BASE AUGMENTATION UNDER THE MAY REVISE EVEN THOUGH THERE YOU TEND TO BE STAFF INTENSIVE AND FACED A LOT OF THE SAME COST PRESSURES AS THE OTHER CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THAT AREN'T RECEIVING AN INCREASE. SO LEGISLATURE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO GIVE A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT TO THE SAME SAID AS THE GOVERNOR A LARGER SET FOR A HIGHER BASE THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING. AND AS WITH THE ONE TIME FUNDS I MET THE LEGISLATURE COULD FREE UP FUNDING FOR COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS OR OTHER LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES BY REJECTING ONGOING PROPOSALS- THAT THE LEGISLATURE DEEMS. UNJUSTIFIEDOR OTHERWISE LOWER PRIORITY AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT IN IN FEBRUARY AGAIN SHE ADDS BUT OUR OFFICES SHARED SOME. IDEAS WITH YOUR STAFF. AND WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS THIS YEAR IF YOU'D LIKE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES HERE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT ITS STAMP ON TOO MANY COLLEGES BUDGET AND MAKE SURE IT'S LIKE JUST IT'S REFLECTING THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION MY NAME IS LIZ THAT NEVER IT AND THE LICENSE FOR COLLEGE FINANCING FACILITIES PLANNING AT THE COMPANY CAN COLLEGES PUTTING STUDENTS FIRST CONTINUES TO BE THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND ALL OF OUR ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR COLLEGES ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC AND SO WE ARE THANKFUL THAT GOVERNOR RECENT ISN'T INDUSTRY SHOULD HAVE PROPOSED IN THE REVISED AT LEAST STRONG FOUNDATION FOR RE EMERGING FROM THE PANDEMIC EQUITABLY. FORESEEN OUR SYSTEM IS KEY TO THE RESILIENCY STRATEGY THE INVESTMENTS PRESENTED IN THE MAY REVISE GENERALLY FLL INTO SIX CATEGORIES RESTORING INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES BECAUSE PANDEMIC RECOVERY DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION AFFORDABILITY AND BATES BASIC NEEDS WORKFORCE AND PATHWAYS ALL ATTENTION ON OUR PERSPECTIVE ON SOME OF THESE WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE PAY DOWN OF THE ONE POINT FOUR FIVE IN DEFERRALS AND SEE THIS AS KEY TO PUTTING THE HARDSHIPS OF THE PANDEMIC BEHIND US. WE ARE VERY THANKFUL THAT THE LEGISLATURE HEARD OUR CONCERNS AND JOINED US- IN ELEVATING THE NEED FOR PARITY- IN OUR COAL AND STRONGLY SUPPORT THE ADJUSTMENT ABOUT FOUR POINT. ZERO FIVE COLA. RENDON POSE PANDEMIC RECOVER THE DESTRUCTION BECAUSE BY THE CAN DEMO. A LEFT LINGERING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES PARTICULARLY FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR AS EVIDENCED BY OUR OUR ENROLLMENT DECLINES AS SUCH WE SUPPORT THE MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES FOR RETENTION AND ENROLLMENT STRATEGIES. AND DEFERRED PAYMENTS THAT WILL HELP US COME BACK TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. FOR DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION THE GOVERNOR PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE OUR IMPORTANT WORK TO DISMANTLE STRUCTURES. THAT PERPETUATE SYSTEMIC RACISM WE SUPPORT THE FOLLOWING INVESTMENTS THAT CLOSE EQUITY GAPS EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY THE REGISTRY MODERNIZATION AND- BASING CREASE FOR INSTANT EQUITY ACHIEVEMENT. WE DO HOWEVER HAVE A CONCERN AROUND THE CONTINUED- THE CONDITIONS REQUIRE DISTRICTS TO MAINTAIN ONLINE COURSE OFFERINGS AT LEAST 10% HIGHER THAN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. I LET ME CLARIFY WE DO NOT HAVE CONCERNS ONLINE COURSE OFFERINGS AND BELIEVE THAT THEY PROVIDE MUCH FLEXIBILITY TO POSE TRADITIONAL LEARNERS. WITH WE DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE AROUND THE HARD AND FAST RULE FOR TEN PERCENT. AND SO- WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FOCUS SHOULD BE ON QUALITY AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY. AN ONLINE AD. WE THE VARIOUS. I'LL WORK FOR PURPLE UNDER TO PARTNER. BIG WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD SO THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON EMERGING INDUSTRIES- IN PARTICULAR A HIGH ROAD AND WORK BASED LEARNING. AROUND THE AFFORDABILITY AGENDA WE HAVE A LOT OF ALIGNMENT WITH THE ASSEMBLIES ARE CONCERNED WERE DISAPPOINTED TO NOT SEE HOW GRANT REFORM IN THIS PROPOSAL OUR STUDENTS DESPERATELY NEED ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID AND AS PART OF A CONCERTED EFFORT TO ENSURE BASIC NEEDS. ARE STRUGGLING STUDENTS ARE MEANT WE BELIEVE THE STATE NEEDS TO ALSO ADDRESS LONG- LOT LONG TERM FINANCIAL AID. I SPECIFICALLY OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES STUDENTS ENTRY INTO THE EXCLUSIONARY CAL GRANT SITS DOWN. IN LATE FEBRUARY THE GOVERNOR'S RECOVERY WITH EQUITY REPORT INCLUDED A GOAL THAT LEARNERS WOULD RECEIVE SUPPORT YOUR BASIC NEEDS THERE IS SIMPLIFIED INTEGRATED SYSTEM THE CONCEPT IS SIMPLE YET VERY PROFOUND RE DESIGNER STRUCTURES TO SUPPORT STUDENTS HOLISTICALLY. IN THEIR DAILY LIVES TO DO WE DON'T HAVE TO CONSTANTLY ASK THEM TO PROVE THAT THEY'RE POOR WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO APPLY THIS CONCEPT IN THE VARIOUS BASIC NEEDS PROPOSALS IN THIS PROJECT. WE ARE ARE GLAD TO SEE A CONTINUED INVESTMENT OUR PATHWAYS EFFORTS THIS IS A FRAMEWORK THAT HELPS US STREAMLINE ITS STUDENTS JOURNEY THROUGH COLLEGE BY PROVIDING CONSTRUCTION CHOICE IN REVAMPS IMPORTS SO THAT ULTIMATELY STUDENTS CAN ACHIEVE THEIR COMPLETION AND COLLEGE GOALS. AND LASTLY WE URGE CONSIDERATION AND- FOR KOHLI'S FOR THE VERY CATEGORICAL THAT HAVE NOT SEEN THEM FOR MANY YEARS INCLUDING THE MO JO A FINANCIAL AID AND OTHERS THAT DIRECTLY SERVE STUDENTS. AND AND WE ASK FOR CONSIDERATION OF GREATER CHANCES OFFICE CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THESE NEARLY A DOZEN NEW OR EXPANDED INITIATIVES. WITH THAT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONTINUED SUPPORT OF OUR SYSTEM OKAY. THANK YOU START WITH SOMEONE MEMBER MEDINA. YEAH I COUPLE ISSUES I WANT TO BRING UP THE FIRST ONE WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. I AND SHOULD I- SHARE THE ENTHUSIASM. FOR THE NEW BASIC NEEDS CENTERS- TO BE ESTABLISHED AND FUNDED WITH THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS- THANK YOU KNOW I'VE CERTAINLY HEARD. IN THE LAST. YEAR YEAR AND A HALF TWO YEARS OF THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS- UP AND DOWN THE STATE. AND WILL ADDRESS THE- STUDENT AT CAL GRANT REFORM IN THE NEXT ITEM BECAUSE THAT IS ALSO NEEDED. BUT FOR THE BASIC NEEDS CENTERS OF THAT ARE GONNA BE ESTABLISH. HOW WILL THESE CENTERS COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL AND COUNTY PROGRAMS AND HOW LONG WILL BE SANDERS. TAKE TO BE IMPLEMENTED. THANK YOU THAT'S A VERY THAT'S A QUESTION ARE THE TEAMS OFFICE ACTUALLY. A PERSPECTIVE WHERE WE ARE SEEKING AT LINEMEN'S AND BETTER INTEGRATION REALLY REDESIGNED STRATEGY FOR BASIC NEEDS ALSO BRINGS AND VERY S. CAMPUS SUPPORTS THAT ARE ALREADY- OFFERED INCLUDING FINANCIAL AID. FOOD PANTRIES AND OTHER CORE SUPPORTS FOR STUDENTS WE BELIEVE THAT THAT INSURANCE AT THESE CENTERS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO THE DRIVERS OF THE CULTURE OF OUR BASIC NEEDS AND THIS INTEGRATED HOLISTIC APPROACH FOR OUR STUDENTS. AND THAT IT LEVERAGES EXISTING AND NEW INVESTMENTS IN THIS APPROACH WOULD BE THE FIRST IN THE STATE TO OFFER BASIC NEEDS AND FINANCIAL AID THROUGH THIS HOLISTIC APPROACH- AND IT'S REALLY WHAT WE KNOW IS WORKING AND A LOT OF RESEARCH. BACKS UP MORE OF THIS ONE STOP. APPROACH FIRST STUDENTS SO WITH THAT WE THINK THAT WE CAN HAVE BASIC NEEDS BE MORE SUCCESSFUL ON OUR CAMPUSES. AGAIN LEVERAGING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURES AND NOT RELYING JUST ON ONE PERSON TO SERVE CAPACITY OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE REALLY A CASE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. AND TO THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION. DO WE HAVE AN AYE OF HOW LONG IT MAY TAKE IMPLEMENT THESE. CENTERS YES IF WE GO AN IN. APPROACH THAT A LEVEL WHAT EXIST WITHIN OUR FINANCIAL AID OFFICES THIS WOULD- TAKE MUCH LESS TIME THAN IF WE HAVE TO GO OUT AND STOP LISTENING CENTER HIRE A NEW PERSON INSTEAD WE WOULD WORK THIS SUMMER WITH THE EXISTING TEAMS THERE. AND CONTINUE TO AGAIN- BUILT ON AND BRING IN FINANCIAL AID CHOIR BASIC NEEDS COORDINATORS ARE AND BEGIN WORK ON THE INTEGRATION THIS WOULD BE A KEY OFFERED THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER AND FALL. JOHN HEARING YOU SAY THAT IT COULD BE DONE PRETTY QUICKLY. YES ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. MY NEXT QUESTION IS TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- AND PERTAINS TO COBB RIGHT- I HEARD YOU SPEAK ABOUT- HOW DID YOU REFER TO IT- RECOMMENDATIONS- THIS FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THINGS THAT COULD BE. DEFERRED OR OR NOT FUNDED- SO TO THE LEGISLATIVE- ANALYST'S OFFICE IS CALLED RIGHT AMONG THAT IN THAT LIST. IT'S A POLICY AGAIN WITH LIVE ANALYST- SELLER WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO WAS PROPOSALS BY THE GOVERNOR IN JANUARY OR MAY WE'VE RESPONDE TO THOSE- PROPOSALS WITH OUR OWN RECOMMENDATIONS SUGGESTIONS LEGISLATURE OPTIONS LEGISLATURE ON WHAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO DO WITH THOSE PROPOSALS. THERE'S NO PROPOSAL IN THIS BUDGET PERTAINING TO COUNT RIGHT WE ACTUALLY HAD A SUGGESTION LAST YEAR WHEN THE STATE WAS FACING UP BUDGET CUTS I TO CONSIDER CUTTING OR EVEN ELIMINATING CALIBRATE. I WE DO NOT HAVE SUCH A RECOMMENDATION THIS YEAR THERE'S NO THERE'S NO PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE- BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY- COURSE LEGISLATURE HAS THAT ABILITY AND- THAT PROVOCATIVE TO KEEP LOOKING AT CAL BRIGHTON SEEN IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO KEEP OR NOT AS PART OF A- OF A BUDGET- OR- POLICY DECISION. THANK YOU AND TO- DEPARTMENT IF I. OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE LAST AUDIT THAT WE GOT FROM THE THAT THE- THE STATE AUDITOR I REPORTED THAT DESPITE THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO COVER RIGHT COLLEGE ONLY TWELVE STUDENTS HAVE GRADUATED. AND WE SAW IT A. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY TWO. AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW AND MYSELF GET. UNANIMOUS VOTE IN IN THE- IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ASSEMBLY WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT UP- WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE- RECOMMENDATION AND WHAT ARE THE ADMINISTRATORS IT'S PLAN. ON ON CALIBRATE COLLEGE TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HI MISHANI WHEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- HELLO WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING- THAT AUDIT REPORT BUT AS A MY A COLLEAGUE AT THE ALLEY- MENTIONED YOU KNOW THE MAY REVISION DOESN'T PROPOSE ANY. CHANGES TO THE FUNDING LEVEL FOR CALIBRATE COLLEGE AND- YOU KNOW IT'S BAD THAT THE COLLEGE IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE INCREASED ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION FOR YOU KNOW THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT A POST SECONDARY DEGREE. AND THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS TO MORE TRADITIONAL SETTINGS AND YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT POSITION. SO WHEN IT IS SAID THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATION FOR CHANGE THAT THAT IS ALSO BECAUSE THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION I BELIEVE. OR THE MONEY ALLOCATED WHICH MAY BE MORE THAN A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. HAS NOT HAS NOT BEEN SPENT ENTIRELY- AND I WOULD JUST. ADD THAT THAT THE AUDIT ALSO SHOWS THAT COBB RIGHT ALSO HAS NO PLAN. IN PLACE TO SHOW. EXACTLY HOW THEY'RE GONNA MEET THE GOALS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED BY BY THE LEGISLATURE SO AGAIN I WOULD JUST RECOMMEND THAT. THAT AS WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT MONEY BEING ABLE TO USE BETTER ELSEWHERE- THAT MANY THAT IS ALREADY BEEN ALLOCATED TO CALIBRATE. OF BE REDIRECTED THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU THE ARRESTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BECAUSE THE ONE MEMBER WHO IS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE GRADUATE I DID THE MY APOLOGIES- MISTER CHAIR ARE YOU ARE ALSO A GRADUATE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHERE I HAVE- GREAT RESPECT FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IN HIGHER EDUCATION I HAVE QUESTIONS IN THREE AREAS ONE IS HAVING TO DO WITH THE COLA- BUT IS. A- WE DO APPRECIATE THE ONGOING INVESTMENT OF THE FOUR POINT OH FIVE. PERCEPT COLA BUT THERE IS GREAT CONCERN AS TO WHY IT WAS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE UC CSU AND CSU- AT THE 5% BASE AUGMENTATION WE DO KNOW THAT K. THROUGH TWELVE DID GET THE FOUR POINT OH FIVE BUT THEN THEY GOT THE ADDITIONAL 1% INCREASE IN L. C. F. F. BASE FUNDING. WHY DID THE WHY DIDN'T THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES GET THE SAME CONSIDERATION BEING GIVEN TO- TO GIVE THE ADDITIONAL 1% INCREASE SIMILAR TO WHAT K. TWELVE RECEIVED. DAN HAD OR THE OF FINANCE. THAT THE DIRECTLY THAT THE MAYOR VISION DOES REFLECT THAT UNITED HEY AND AUGMENTED COBA ARE COLLECTING NOT ONLY THE STATUTORY- COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THE BUDGET YEAR ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT. ALSO INCORPORATING AN ACT IN A COMPOUND MODEL TO TWO POINT THREE ONE FORGOTTEN CALLED UP FROM THE CURRENT YEAR- I BELIEVE I HAVE TO BOY THE PARTY MIGHT HAVE BEEN A PART OF MY COLLEAGUES TO COVER THE OUTFIT TO. TAKE THIS THAT IT BUT I KNOW THE WERE SOME TENSE BUDGET TO THE BASE THERE AS YOU. THAT LED TO WHAT WHAT IS INCLUDED ARE ATTRACTIVE IT PERSON POINT AND THOSE CALCULATIONS WERE SPECIFIC TO- DLT ABOUT THE SUPPOSED TO THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA- I WOULD OFTEN AT THAT THE BETWEEN. REFLECTS OUR BOUNCING. OF DATA ONGOING AT ONE TIME RESOURCE ENERGY TO PROPOSITION NINETY CARE THAT ALL TO THE BY TO- TOWARD STUDENTS. PROVIDE ONGOING FUNDING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS IN ORDER TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS ARE ADDED. TO THE FUTURE. YEAH I WAS AS A FALL UP ON THE ONE I WOULD. HOUSE THE ADDITIONAL 1% TO THE BAY BECAUSE- OF BEFORE COMMUNITY CALL. AS WAS- EXISTING PROPOSED FOR THE K. TWELVE- THE SECOND QUESTION IS THERE I SEE THAT THERE'S FUNDING FOR ELP PROGRAM AND A NUMBER OF OTHER PROGRAMS BUT IS THERE A SPECIFIC REASON WHY THE- MO JO A WENT THERE AND MESS UP WERE NOT INCLUDED. SURE SEVEN IN THE BUDGET REFLECTS OUR REFLECTS EXISTING PRACTICE OF CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THAT RECEIVED A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT SO BUT THE PROGRAMS ARE COULD SO MUCH OF THE TICKET PRACTICE WITH CONTINUED INTO THE ABOUT YEAR. THE THESE THREE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS A MO JO ONE DAY AND MASS I HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS WITH OUR STUDENTS AND I WOULD ELSE THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION RECONSIDER- THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY DESERVING OF INCREASES BECAUSE OF THEIR GREAT SUCCESS WITH OUR STUDENTS. R. IN THE LAST QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO- FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE'S QUESTIONS REGARDING THE BASIC NEEDS CENTERS AND COORDINATORS. IF MY MATH IS CORRECT WITH THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND OTHER HOT ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN OR ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN CAMPUSES. HOW MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGES DO WE HAVE. YOU HAVE A HUNDRED SIXTEEN ONE SIXTEEN THEM IF THE TOTAL AMOUNT FOR EACH OF THOSE IS UNDER TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND IS THAT ENOUGH. THANK YOU YES YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT- THAT REALLY ISN'T ENOUGH IN TERMS OF THE CASE MANAGED APPROACH AND ONE THAT CAN HOLISTICALLY SUPPORT EVERY STUDENT WE HAVE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE AS MANY AS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS. DO YOU CAN ENVISIONED HOW CHALLENGING IT CAN BE FOR ONE PERSON TO HANDLE THE NEEDS OF EVEN HALF OF THAT POPULATION WITH A MORE INTEGRATED STRATEGY THAT HAS BASIC NEEDS AT THE CORE- AND STILL BRINGS ON OF THE BASIC NEEDS COORDINATOR TO DERIVE THAT WORK- WE THINK THAT WE CAN SERVE MORE STUDENTS TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE SAME PRINCIPLES OUTLINED- BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND IN LEGISLATION. THAT'S CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH. I THINK I FOUND THE U. FOR THE- MONEY. TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR. FOR THESE BASIC NEEDS CENTERS AND ALSO FOR OUR OTHER SUPPORT- CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS LIKE REMOTE JOB WENT IN MESSA. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELL THANK YOU IS THAT A IS THAT A MOTION MAJORITY LETTER. WELL I WILL NOTE THAT A LOT OF TIMES THAT WE COMPLAIN THAT THE GOVERNOR- ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T PUT SOMETHING IN THE BUDGET AND JUST REMIND US THAT WE'RE A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. HITS HIS VERSION WE DO OUR OWN BUDGETS WELL OF OUR PLAN THAT WE'RE GONNA ADOPT. IN THE COMING DAYS AND YOU KNOW YOU BET THAT THESE. AUGMENTATIONS FOR EMOJI A PLANT DAY- MESA AND RISING SCHOLARS TO WHICH I KNOW THE COMMUNICORP CATCHES OFFICES BIG ON SUPPORTING THANK YOU MISTER AT- WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THOSE ARE OUR PRIORITY SAID THAT ARE FUNDED. IN IN IN THE BUDGET AS WELL SO- HI I JUST KNOW THAT ARE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM OUR COMMUNICATORS LAST FOUR MONTHS THAT. YOU KNOW THEY DID A GREAT JOB THE CHANCES OFFICE IN THE LEAGUE- TO GOING REMINDING US THAT THE COLA ALLOCATION WAS UNFAIR SO THAT'S ADDRESSED IN THE REVISED UP. I THINK THATS PROBABLY THREE QUARTERS OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT WE WANTED TO ADDRESS FROM THIS FROM THE SYSTEM AND- WILL TRY TO. FINE TUNE THE PROPOSAL FOR THE COMMUNICATORS IN THE COMING DAYS SO WITH THAT WE'LL TRY TO OUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF A US. I'LL JUST ASK ONE PROMISE. MAYBE THEM. REVISION PROPOSED AN ADDITION HIGH. MILLION AND ONE TIME FOR A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION TO INCREASE DEGREE OPTIONS USING OPEN SOURCE MATERIALS WITH ZERO TEXTBOOK COST. A REPORT ON THE USE OF THE FIVE MILLION PROVIDED IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN IS MORE THAN A YEAR OVERDUE AND GALLIO HAS EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT REPEATING. OR EXPANDING THIS EFFORT WITHOUT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIRST. IS THE T. C. X- EXPERIENCE HAS- HAS THE SEGMENT COMPLETED THE REPORT ABOUT THE FIVE MILLION PROVIDED. FOR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND IF SO WHAT WERE THE FINDINGS. THE NUMBER OF DEGREES AND COURSES INCLUDED AND WHAT ABOUT. THE STUDENT PARTICIPATION AND SAVINGS. THANK YOU I. TO ANSWER FIRST QUESTION. A CHANCE IS OFTEN HAS SUBMITTED THAT REPORT WILL MAKE SURE THAT. THAT IS A BILL IN A COPY IS PROVIDED YOU MEMBERS THAT BY SUB. SOME OF THE FINDINGS- WERE THAT- THIS STRETCH. SAVES ARE AN ESTIMATED US SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR- FOR THE- EFFORTS. ONE OTHER RECKON- IS REFLECTED IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED LOOK AT SOME OF THE BEES PATHWAYS ARE CAN'T COMPLETELY. ZERO TEXTBOOK COST BECAUSE THEIR ROYALTIES ASSOCIATED. AND SO YOU SEE THAT PROPOSAL INCLUDED AND RECOGNIZES THAT SOME WILL HAVE TO BE LOW COST EFFORTS- WE ALSO CONTINUED TO HEAR FROM OUR STUDENTS. THAT TEXTBOOK COSTS CONTINUE TO BE A KEY DRIVER TO SOME OF THEIR AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES SO WE DO THINK THAT THIS DESERVES A LOT OF MERIT- THEY- THEY INVESTMENTS WOULD COVER NOT ONLY. AT DEVELOPING THESE OUT COURSE IS PRO. BUT IT ALSO WILL COVER. THE FACT TIME DEVELOP THESE TWO- I DON'T KNOW. QUAN RESEARCH. INCIDENT THAT ARE ARE USED AND TO DELIVER THE SAME AND THEY WOULD GET FROM- EXISTING TEXTBOOKS. TERRA CARNEY YES. MAY I SPEAK MY RESPOND OF COURSE. OKAY SO I DID WANT TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTION AND ALSO TO WHAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM MISS NAVARETTE SO THE REPORT- DID ARRIVE IT WAS THE LAST MONTH IT WAS- BY YEAR AND A HALF LATE AND IT- TALKED ABOUT HOW THE MONEY FROM THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN INITIATIVE I WAS SPENT AND WHAT THE RESULTS ARE- WHEN YOU READ THE REPORT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY YOU'LL BE KIND OF DISAPPOINTED THERE WASN'T A LOT OF INFORMATION THERE IT SEEMS TO BE THERE SOME DATA COLLECTION ISSUES. WITH THAT THE REPORT DOES MENTION THAT BUT- DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THAT JUST WANT O POINT OUT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AFTER ALL THIS TIME STILL LAKES LACKS BASIC INFORMATION ON HOW THAT FIRST INITIATIVE WHEN WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT THE EXTENT TO WHICH FACULTY- HAVE ACTUALLY CHOSEN TO USE THESE MATERIALS THAT WERE TRADED WITH THIS MONEY YOU KNOW THEY HAVE ACADEMIC FREEDOM THEY CAN DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO USE OPEN RESOURCE- OPEN EDUCATION RESOURCES OVER CHARGE THE OLD YOU KNOW HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR TEXTBOOK LIKE THEY ALWAYS HAVE WE DON'T KNOW IF FACULTY ACTUALLY USING. THESE RESOURCES IN THESE PATHWAYS WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS ACTUALLY COMPLETED EIGHT ZERO TEXTBOOK COST DEGREE OF DEGREE OR PATHWAY WERE ON TRACK TO DO ONE WE DON'T KNOW HOW THEY PERFORMED ACADEMICALLY- WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CHALLENGES WERE ENCOUNTERED BY GRANTEES YOU KNOW THAT THE COLLEGES THAT GOT THIS MONEY IN DEVELOPING THESE- THESE PATHWAYS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE REPORT WE ACTUALLY THE REPORT DOES NOT LAY OUT HOW MUCH SAVINGS WERE GENERATED WE DO KNOW THAT. STUDENTS SPEND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY PER YEAR ON. AVERAGE ON TEXTBOOKS WE DON'T KNOW. OVER HOW THESE TWO. SAVED MY AWAY TO SAVE MONEY SO. AFTER ALL THIS TIME THE LARGEST STILL HAVE ANSWERS TO VERY BASED QUESTION SO WE'RE REALLY WRECKED. THE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THIS PROPOSED. IN THE MAY REVEAL PROVIDE A HIGH AND- MILLION FOR THE PROGRAM. WE COULD WE RECOMMEND YOU YOU YOU CONSIDER REJECTING AND CHILL GET THIS. WE CAN GET THIS AND- IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS THEN THEN LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION THE LEGISLATURE- AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND ITS CHANCES OFFICE BUT- I DON'T. AT THIS POINT I DON'T THINK THAT. INFORMATION ON. I WOULD- AGREED AND I THINK IT IS PREMATURE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING. YOU KNOW THE FINDINGS AND WERE HAVING REAL DATA A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IS A LOT OF MONEY- AND IT IS YOU KNOW CONCERNING TO ME. AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A STUDENT THAT YOU KNOW KIND OF OUR TEXTBOOK I TOOK A- CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CLASS WITHOUT THE TEXTBOOK BUT STILL GOING TO BE- BUT IT WAS HARD IT. I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW OUR STUDENTS ARE AT BUT I'M REALLY HESITANT TO PROVIDE A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. I'M NOT KNOWING WHAT THE DATA ACTUALLY SAYS AND IT'S A BIT PREMATURE SO- AT. THE LAST QUESTION ALL OUT IS HAS ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERED TARGETING DIZZY T. C. EFFORT TO SPECIFIC COURSES WITH HIGH ENROLLMENT. SUCH AS GENERAL EDUCATION OR TRANSFER PATHWAYS IS NOT A BETTER WAY- TO HELP. A GREATER AMOUNT OF STUDENTS AGAIN DANTAN ARE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF- SO THE- PROPOSAL. THE CONTINUING OF A BIGGER TICKET PROGRAM THE X. TO- INCLUDE OPEN AND OR OR OR LOW COST PRO- I THINK THAT. GOAL REALLY IS TO REDUCE THE COST ATTENDANCE THE STUDENT- SPECIFICALLY RELY TO TECH AND SO I THINK WE WOULD BE AND ENGAGE A COVER. ABOUT HOW THE DO THAT BUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S OVER TO GET THIS PRO THAT WE GOOD RESULTS FROM FAR. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. I THINK NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO MOVE ALONG AND- AB UP. THE. IN THIS TUNE COMMISSION- HASTING THE LIBRARY AND GET THE PUBLIC. IF YOU FOR YOUR NAY CAN. HM AND MY W. LIKE TO HAVE A WITH THE OF. TO SUPPORT WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN DISPLACED AS A RESULT OF THE CALL BUT NINETEEN PANDEMIC THE PROPOSAL THE RICE THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO THIS PLACE WORKERS TO COVER THE COST OF POST SECONDARY PROGRAMS HIGH QUALITY TRAINING PROGRAMS OR TO START A BUSINESS. WHAT ARE THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRAHAM PROGRAM. THAT MAY WOULD BE FROM AND OF FOUR MILLION GEN FUND ONE TIME FOR THE TOTAL FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM THERE IS ALSO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROGRAM. WHICH EFFECTIVELY AUTHORIZES INTERNS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE TEACHING CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS. TO BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM. AT THE TRAILER BILL ALSO AMENDS THE DEFINITION OF HIGH NEED FIELDS. TO INCLUDE. TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. OBLAK THERE SEVERAL. I JUST- PERTAINING TO THE DIFFERENT COLOR. AND THE MAY REVISION ALSO. COSTS OF THE GOVERNOR BY THE FOR- AND I'M HAPPY. TO GET INTO THAT BECAUSE THE- IF IT'S NEEDED ALSO HOW IT'S TAKEN QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU. ELIA. THANK YOU BECAUSE RENDON ON THE EDUCATION TRAINING SCRIPT PLACE WHERE WE DO REFERENCE BOTH. ONE CONNECTED TO THE STATE WORKFORCE TO SYSTEM. PANTHERA BY LOCAL EXPERTS ON BOARD. AND SO FORTH. THIS PROGRAM% PROTECTING RESOURCES IN TRYING TO. NOTIFY THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION DEVELOP NEW SYSTEMS TO DELIVER GRANTS NOT JUST TO COLLEGE STUDENTS BUT ALSO THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW LONG THEY TAKE TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM IN PART BECAUSE IT'S INTENDED TO ADDRESS AT A VERY TIME SENSITIVE ISSUE UNEMPLOYMENT DURING THE ECONOMIC. BUT YOU CONSIDERATIONS IN MIND THE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL. X. THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT THIS TO MEET COMMISSION IS CURRENTLY A MINISTER IN THE FIRST ROUND OF FRANCE UNDER THE PROPOSAL IS IN THE FIFTEEN MILLION FEDERAL FUNDS PROVIDED FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I'M GONNA FIND NOTED THE GOVERNOR'S. WENT INCREASE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. SHE WOULD CALL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. ONE AS THE EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM BEFORE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE FIRST ROUND AND- NONETHELESS A PLEDGE. DOES MUCH TO REPORT THIS REPORT. WE CAN CONSTRUCT THE PEOPLE FABRIC ANY REPORT AND OUT. INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF TEACHER TYPICALLY THEIR SERVICE REQUIREMENTS. BY BETTER INFORMATION ON SHE'LL ACCEPT BEING TRAPPED OF THE KIND OF PROGRAM AND TEACHING DESPITE. THANK YOU HAVE A QUESTION. OKAY THING YOU STATE COMMISSION. GOOD MORE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'D TAKE FROM HER ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION THANKS FOR HAVING US TODAY I'M I'LL BE BRIEF IN MY COMMENTS HERE- PARTICULARLY ON THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM I WILL NOTE THAT THE COMMISSION DOES SUPPORT THIS PROPOSED EXPANSION OF THE FUNDS- AVAILABLE TO- ADDRESS WHAT WE KNOW IS A CRITICAL SHORTAGE ANARCHY THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION SYSTEM WHEN IT COMES TO OUR TEACHER PIPELINE- ALL NOW TURN MY COMMENTS TO THE GOLDEN STATE EDUCATION ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND TRAINING GRANT PROGRAM. I'M THE COMMISSION IS GRATEFUL TO FEED THIS PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH WILL HELP US BETTER SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS AS THEY SEEK EDUCATIONAL AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES OR START THEIR OWN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE AND WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WITH THE APPROPRIATE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING AND STAFFING CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL AS WITH ENGAGEMENT- WITH OUR HIGHER EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE AND BUSINESS PARTNERS THE COMMISSION COULD EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THIS NEW APPROACH. TO SUPPORTING DISCONNECTED WORKERS. TOTAL WOULD ALSO BE A MEANS THE DRAWING DISLOCATED WORKERS BACK INTO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR UPSKILLING AND RESKILLING. AT THE VERY POPULATION THAT AS YOU KNOW IS CURRENTLY UNDERSERVED BY OUR TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS. AS WE DISCUSSED IN A PRIOR SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING AND I KNOW MEMBERS ARE VERY WELL AWARE. THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS STILL FEATURES OUTDATED RATIONING DEVICES THEY KEEP OUT STUDENTS WERE OLDER OR TAKING SOME TIME TO WORK AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. THESE ARE THE SAME STUDENTS AND BE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WHERE THEY FACE ONE IN EIGHT CHANCE OF RECEIVING AN AWARD DESPITE BEING ELIGIBLE BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL NEED. AND THEIR ACADEMIC STANDING. THE GRANTS UNDER THE PROPOSED GOLDEN STATE EDUCATION ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND TRAINING PROGRAM WOULD ALLOW US TO RE ENGAGE THE POTENTIAL STUDENTS AND BRING THEM BACK INTO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. WELL IT OPTING TO CAL GRANT EQUITY FRAMEWORK AS OUTLINED IN AB FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX BY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- MEDINA MCCARTY. WOULD PROVIDE THEM WITH GREATER ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID TO SUPPORT THEIR SUCCESS AFTER THE ANVIL. SO OFTEN LEAVE MY COMMENT THERE FOR NOW AND WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU MR MEDINA. THANK YOU- TO JAKE FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION SO MY QUESTION IS TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS BUT ARE UNABLE TO RECEIVE THEM DUE TO THE SMALL NUMBER OF AWARDS. AND SO GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS- THAT COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE CAL GRANT AND THAT SIGNIFICAN NON TUITION CLASS. THAT THE THAT THE STUDENTS FACE WHY ISN'T THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSING A CAL GRANT EXPANSION. MATCH TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION- GOVERNOR MY TENNIS WITH THE PLUMBING OF FINANCE DEMONSTRATION DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE CURRENT PROGRAM MODERNIZATION PROPOSAL- I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT THE MADE FOR A BIG FAN BILLS ON THE AFTERNOON. OF OUR OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WITH BUDGETARY INVESTMENTS AIMED AT REDUCING THE OVERALL COST OF STUDENTS. THIS PROPOSED AUGMENTATIONS. YOU SEPARATE JODY OF. I'M SORRY IS THE MAJORITY OF A ONE TIME FUNDS I DID NOT HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF PRESSURE LIABILITIES. THAT THEY'LL BRING STATE BUDGET- WE FACE SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS INCLUDED STUDENT HOUSING. AT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE KONKURRENZ CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND. REDUCE TEXTBOOK COSTS. THEY WERE GIVEN- THE PROPOSALS IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND IN THE SENATE. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK. WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. IN MAKING SURE THAT WE MODERNIZE THE CAL GRANT- PROGRAM AND THAT WE ARE ABLE TO GET IT DONE THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I CONCUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA I I'VE I'VE SPOKEN TO PERMANENT FINANCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S. OFFICE ABOUT THIS THEY KNOW IT'S A PRIORITY AND THEY YOU KNOW SUPPORT AT NIGHT. THE BUDGET IS THAT THE OPPORTUNITY A TRANSFORMATIONAL BUDGET AND INVESTING IN OUR PRIORITIES AND SO- YOU KNOW I ONLY GIVE IT AT AT AT A NOT A PLUS BECAUSE- THIS IS ONE OPPORTUNITY WHERE I THINK THAT IF WE WANT TO. TRANSFORM OUR ECONOMY AND OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND UPWARD MOBILITY IT'S ACCESS TO HIGHER pEDUCATION SO IT'S MORE ENROLLMENT SLOTS WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT WITH UC AND CSU. AND IT'S OUR PLAN TO MODERNIZE THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM AND MAKE COLLEGE DEBT FREE. I KNOW THE SENATE IS GOING ALL IN ON THIS ON THEIR SIDE- IT'S IN OUR ASSEMBLY BLUEPRINT. TO FOCUS ON THIS AS WELL SO- WE'RE GOING TO BE. LOOKING AT A DUSTING THAT THE MAY REVISE AND SOME OF THESE ISSUES- THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR AND POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT WHERE THE REVENUES ARE FOR ON GOING. TO PRIORITIZE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME WE'VE WE'VE HAD YOU KNOW THREE OR FOUR BILLS ON THIS IN FIVE YEARS AND SO- IF WE CAN'T DO IT THIS YEAR. WHEN ARE WE EVER GONNA DO IT MR MEDINA SELF. GET OUT WHO WILL YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THAT- FINANCIAL AID IS SO KEY AND AS THE CITY COMMISSION ALLUDED TO WE HAVE. THE ENVY OF THE WORLD ARE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS BUT IT JUST GETS IT IT FOCUSES ON GETTING PEACEKEEPING KEEPING PEOPLE OUT. ESPECIALLY OLDER STUDENTS WHO WERE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AS MISS NEVER AT SAID WITH THAT COMMUNICORP CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SO. WE REALLY WANT TO- YOU KNOW BUILD BACK BETTER LIKE THE OUR PRESIDENT SAYING IN. THE END- FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE CALIFORNIA CAN THRIVE IN THE FUTURE GENERATIONS. IT'S COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND FINANCIAL AID WHICH WILLING TO STEP IT UP WITH SELF. THIS IS AN UNFINISHED BUSINESS FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND- STAY TUNED ON THIS UP. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF IDENTITY- TOO BECAUSE- THE FIRST ONE FOUR SO THE STATE TEACHER GRANT PER- WE STOOD. WHO ARE NOT AT ONE OF THE SEGMENTS- BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR THIS CURRENT. IF GOT A TIP BERMAN FINANCE- I THINK THEM EVERY QUESTION- THERE ARE SOME STUDENTS I'M SORRY NOT STUDENTS- YES THERE IS SOME STUDENTS WERE DOING INTERNSHIPS THROUGH THE LOCAL AGENCIES AND ALSO WITH THE OAKWOOD CHRISTIAN AGENCIES AND WITH THE INSTITUTIONS. AT THIS INDIVIDUALS WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT IN THE PROGRAM NOW WITH THE CHANGE- THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY ENTRANCE WILL BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. I JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE IT- EIGHT TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL STUDENTS ESPECIALLY SINCE PART OF ITS TARGETING IS- AS IS WE'RE LOOKING AT TKT EXPANSION- THAT WORK FORCE NEEDS A HUGE INSERTION AND WHEREVER STUDENTS ARE STUDYING EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND EASY. I WISH TO REALLY ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY AND ARE AVAILABLE TO APPLY FOR THIS GRANT- SECONDLY. I'M KIND OF. DID YOU WANT TO ADD I'M SORRY. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT LED TRAILER BILL WITH THE CHANGE ONE OF THE CHANGES THAT WE'RE MAKING IN THE HIGH FILL NEED ADS- TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AS PART OF THOSE- EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT WILL QUALIFY. GREAT THANK YOU. I'M THE OTHER THING THAT KINDA JUST. BLOWS MY MIND RIGHT NOW IS. THIS CREATION OF THE GOLDEN STATE EDUCATION ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND TRAINING GRANT PROGRAM. WELL I APPLAUD ITS INTENTION IT'S A BILLION DOLLARS- AND I'M JUST REALLY PERPLEXED AS TO WHY WE WOULD. WHY THIS- PROGRAM WOULDN'T BE UNDER THE PURVIEW OF GULBIS IT JUST IT'S IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A NEW PROGRAM WE'RE GONNA BE PUTTING A BILLION DOLLARS INTO IT AND IT'S NOT THE AREA OF EXPERTISE. FOR OUR SEGMENT SO UP I'M REALLY PERPLEXED AS TO WHY- WHY WE WOULD WHY IT'S HERE SO I DON'T KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WANTS TO SPEAK TO THIS I THINK I'M NOT A BUT- THE BILL BIZ WOULD BE BETTER EQUIPPED. TO HANDLE WHAT'S IS WHAT THE INTENTION OF THE PROGRAM IS. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR FEEDBACK TO MANAGEMENT- I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT FUNDING FOR THE ONE BILLION. OF FOR THIS PROGRAM IS DIRECTLY FUNDED FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACTIANCE. I'M SO THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM IS TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. ARE WE SEE THAT THEY COULD GO INTO EDUCATION SECTORS TRAINING SUPPORT OR THE CASE THAT'D BUSINESS AND WE- CONSIDERS THE FACT THAT AN ENTITY THAT COULD. PERFORM THOSE ACTIONS AND USE THEM THE NETWORK OUT THE MANY INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I JUST I'M I'M A BIT OF A SCAB HERE- I MEAN. IT'S SO IF WE'RE USING THE MONEY FOR HIGH QUALITY TRAINING PROGRAMS I GET THAT BUT FOR STARTING A BUSINESS- EIGHT. FOR WHICH THE RECIPIENT HAS ALREADY FILED FOR A BUSINESS LICENSE AND DEVELOPED A BUSINESS PLAN- I'M- I'M I'M MAYBE I'M JUST UNAWARE DO DO THE SEGMENTS AND DO THIS I MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER MYSELF. THE FOR MY FIRST THOUGHT IS NOT TO GO TO MY LOCAL YOU KNOW COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR HIGHER INSTITUTION FOR THIS GUIDANCE- ESPECIALLY IF I'M SOMEONE WHO LOST MY JOB AND IS NOW. LOOKING AT OPENING MY OWN SMALL BUSINESSES ALREADY APPLIED FOR A LICENSE I'M GONNA BE GOING TO THE S. B. A. I'M GONNA BE GOING TO GO BAD SO. I JUST FEEL LIKE THERE'S A HUGE DISCONNECT AND IT'S A BILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. WE GET IT RIGHT SO THE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE I'M JUST GOING TO A POINT THAT TO MY- COLLEGE AN APPRENTICE TO FUNDED DETAILED. DURING ACCIDENT. SORRY THANK YOU I. DID MENTAL AND MY COLLEAGUE THAT COME INTO MY COLLEAGUE AT AND HI THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM WE'RE TRYING TO DIRECTLY RESPOND TO YOU I KNEW NEEDS YOU TO CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC ONLY RECOGNIZE THE BEST OF IT AND VERY UNIQUE PROGRAM. I ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT WE'RE IN A VERY UNIQUE TIME IN THE STATE AND THE NEEDS OF. THE DISPLACED WORKERS ADVOCATE ARE ARE QUITE UNIQUE AT THAT TIME SO THIS PROGRAM IS A- VERY SPECIFICALLY. TRYING TO TARGET THOSE MEET. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY. IT I JUST FEEL LIKE WE WERE WERE MISSING SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT HERE SELL THANK YOU. YEAH AND NOT TO TOTALLY. THE JUDGE THIS BILL JUST NOTE THAT THE WORDS THAT THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT DISPLACED WORKERS NEEDS THOSE EXACT SAME WORDS WE HEARD WE CREATED CALIBRATE. AND LOOK LOOK HOW THAT IS BEEN LOTS OF FART IMPLEMENTED SO THIS IS A BILLION DOLLARS NOT ONGOING MONEY AND WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF PLACES TO PARK ONE TIME MONIES ARE LOOKING FOR- YOU KNOW. THINGS TO FOCUS ON THE NEEDS BUT- YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO SQUANDER THIS OPPORTUNITY AND LOOK AT OUR BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK FOR. FOR MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR FAMILIES AND WORKERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO. WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AND SOME OF THESE THINGS YOU KNOW WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SETTLE. BY THE TIME WE- PASSED THE BUDGET MAY HAVE TO EVALUATE THESE FURTHER IN THE SUMMER. YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE LEGISLATION ON THE LOOK AT BECAUSE- WE DO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY WE'RE TRYING TO FINALIZE AND SQUARED AWAY BEFORE YOU. DR BUDGET ON JUNE THE FIFTEENTH BUT- I'D RATHER BE RIGHT THAN BE FAST SO. I WITH THAT TERRIBLE WILL HOLD YES. I JUST I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF REITERATE THAT A COUPLE POINTS OR JUST MAKE I THINK THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS. AT A BILLION DOLLARS YEAH SO THE FIRST IS ON STARTING A BUSINESS IS A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TWENTY FIVE. HUNDRED DOLLARS THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS REALLY ENOUGH TO START A BUSINESS WE HAVE THOSE CONCERNS. ALSO JUST THINK ABOUT KIND OF THE THEORY OF CHANGE THE ADMINISTRATION SEEMS TO HAVE WITH THIS. WITH THIS PROPOSAL THIS IDEA THAT IF MONEY IS OFFERED THE DISLOCATED WORKERS WILL JUST KIND OF KNOW ABOUT IT AND WILL BE ENOUGH TO GET THEM TO ENROLL. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO IS AFFECTED BY THE JOB LOSSES WHOSE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE JOB OFFICE JOB LOSSES HIS MONIES INTENDED FOR. ITSLOWERS PRIMARILY LOWER SKILLED INDIVIDUALS NOT COLLEGE EDUCATED THE PARENTS LIKELY DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE IMMIGRANTS PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT THIS IS INTENDED TO HELP- BUT- IT'S UNLIKELY THAT JUST BY PUTTING OUT MONEY AND GIVING MONEY THROUGH THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. INDIVIDUALS WILL JUST KNOW ABOUT THIS BILL. THERE'S NO INVOLVEMENT HERE BY SOMEBODY MENTION KOBE IS OUR LOCAL WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARDS TO. WORK ON REFERRALS- JOB PLACEMENT. SOCIAL SERVICE COORDINATOR. ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE REALLY NEED TO BE PART OF THE PICTURE IN ORDER TO HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF THE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM BECAUSE WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING. FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. OKAY THANK YOU. YES SOMEONE MEMBER S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE CAL GRANT ISSUE- I SINCERELY APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AS- STRONG ADVOCACY CHAMPIONING THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE- WITH OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY. THEY HAVE THE HOUSING COSTS AND YET THAT IS NEVER SOMETHING CONSIDERED FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO AS WE LOOK TO EXPAND AND I HOPE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. WILL RECONSIDER AND AGREED TO THE EXPANSION OF CAL CAL GRANTS THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS NEEDS ALSO BE CONSIDERED VERY SPECIFICALLY- WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT WHO WAS ELIGIBLE HOW MUCH THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR. YES THANK YOU A MAN NOT SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THE COMMITTEE CALLED I'M SORRY THIS DANNY COMMISSION AB. ISSUE OPEN AND GO NOW TO ISSUE NUMBER. FIVE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY MAY REVISED PROPOSALS. IN SEPTEMBER THREE OUT OF BROWN'S PART IN IT. AND PROVIDE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ON GO AND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT THE CALIFORNIA IT LIVE FOR LIBRARY INFRASTRUCTURE BROADBAND ACCESS EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AND LIBRARY PROGRAMS SUPPORTING CALIFORNIANS OF ALL AGES PARTICULARLY RESIDENTS AND UNDERSERVED AND UNDER RESEARCHED COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME OKAY THANK YOU L. L. HI JASON CONCENTRA- I'M IF YOU CAN SENIOR GENDER THERE ARE MANY NUMEROUS LIBRARY PROPOSALS- WHEN WE SUBMITTED COMMENTS TO STAFF. BASIC WE WRITE A LOT OF THESE PROPOSALS AS NEEDING MORE INFORMATION IN RESTORATION HAS SENT. DOWN SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THE CENTER- YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WERE STILL RECEIVING- THAT THAT-INFORMATION SO WE CAN BE IN TOUCH OF STAFF- IS NEEDED. WE DON'T WANT TO TOUCH ON A FEW ISSUES FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. OF THE FIRST OF THAT VERY FIRST PROPOSAL- ON YOUR AGENDA THAT FOCUSES ON LOCAL LIBRARY INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS. ON WE WANTED TO WE THINK THIS RAISES A FEW ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION- AS WE'VE NOTED TO THE COMMITTEE BEFORE LOCAL LIBRARIES ARE PRIMARILY LOCALLY SUPPORTED AND THAT INCLUDES LOCAL LIBRARY CAPITAL PROJECTS. I'M NOT SAID THERE HAVE BEEN SOME RESEARCH RECENTLY- CALIFORNIA RESEARCH BUREAU REALLY RECENTLY DID A pABOUT THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL NEEDS AMONG PUBLIC LIBRARIES. SO THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THERE'S WHERE THERE'S A THERE THERE IS A DEMONSTRATED NEED. IF THIS IS AN AREA THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE. WE RECOMMEND A FEW MODIFICATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FOR EXAMPLE WE RECOMMEND- NARROWING THE SCOPE OF THE GRANTS TO FOCUS ON. ON A MORE LIMITED AMOUNT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS A CAPITAL PROJECT YOUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. WE RECOMMEND THAT BECAUSE YOU'LL SEE AN AGENDA THAT THERE ARE OTHER PROPOSALS RELATED TO OUR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE JUST RECOMMEND ENSURING THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE GRANT PROGRAMS IF THEY DON'T PEOPLE KIDNAPPERS. WELL WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE WERE A FEW PROPOSALS WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE. UP FOR EXAMPLE YOU'LL SEE PROPOSALS RELATED TO ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION AND- ONLINE TUTORING FOR K. TWELVE STUDENTS. WE THINK THESE ARE PROPOSALS LARGELY DUPLICATE. ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING ON AT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES STATE PROVIDES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SHOULD BE BECAUSE ACTIVITIES. WE DON'T SEE A RATIONALE AND PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL SET ASIDE ABOUT FROM FOR LIBRARIES. TO CONDUCTION. IT'S I REALIZED IS ONE OF SO ON HAPPY THAT ON THE DURING. OKAY THANK YOU. STATE LIBRARIAN MISTER LUCAS. HI GREG LOCUSTS CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER- ANY QUESTIONS THE SUBCOMMITTEE HANDS- I WOULD I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE- THE SURVEY THAT JASON WAS TALKING ABOUT OF LIBRARY FACILITIES FINDS A THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR NEED- FROM RESPONDENTS WHO REPRESENT 70% OF THE LIBRARY FACILITIES SO IF YOU SORT OF EXTRAPOLATE THAT OUT THE RENOVATION AND MODERNIZATION NEEDS CLOSER TO ABOUT. FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. SO IS IT IS THIS TO PROVIDE MORE LIBRARY SERVICES OR MODERNIZE AND UPGRADE EXISTING BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE. DEUL NEEDS IN OUR STATE WIDE LIBRARY FACETTI. WELL THAT'S TRUE THERE THERE ARE THE INTENT OF THESE BONDS ARE TO MAKE FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS HAVE THE LIBRARIES IN CALIFORNIA OR FORTY YEARS OF AGE OR OLDR SO THAT MEANS THEY'RE NOT AS ENERGY EFFICIENT AS THEY COULD AND SHOULD BE- THAT MEANS MANY ARE GRANDFATHERED IN UNDER THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT IT MEANS THAT MANY HAVE WIRING THAT INADEQUATE TO DELIVER THE KIND OF HIGH SPEED- BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY THAT'S- BOTH EXPECTED THE NEEDED BY COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OKAY AT. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SIX ZERO NINE I YEAH MISTER GALLAGHER. AS A QUESTION. SO ON THE BUSINESS THIRTY FIVE MILLION FOR COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN LOCAL EDUCATION LIBRARIES AND TELEHEALTH PROVIDERS TO EXPAND INTERNET ACCESS TO ISOLATED COMMUNITIES OBVIOUSLY THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE- BUT THE L. A- INDICATES THAT KEY INFORMATION IS MISSING FROM THIS PROPOSAL- CAN THE ADMINISTRATION SPEAK TO HOW INTERNET ACCESS WOULD BE EXPANDED- HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING THE STATE WOULD RECEIVE. AND WHAT THE BALANCE OF STATE ANOTHER FUNDS WOULD BE TO ACCOMPLISH- THESE COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS. BUT IT'S CRITICAL SO I CAN TAKE A STAB AT THAT- TELL A PROBABLY TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW ALREADY ABOUT THE FEDERAL E. RATE PROGRAM WHICH OFFERS DISCOUNTS BOTH IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS AND OTHERS PAY. FOR THEIR INTERNET CONNECTIVITY- AND IT'S THE RIGHT THE DISCOUNT IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SUBSIDIZED MEALS THAT ARE SERVED AT SCHOOLS IN THE SAME JURISDICTION SO THERE'S PARTS OF THE STATE YOU KNOW SOME SOME YOUR DISTRICT- WHERE. FOR PROVIDERS ARE BIDDING ON THE PROJECTS BECAUSE CONNECTING THE AREAS IS SO EXPENSIVE. ADD THAT TO DO WANT TO ACCOMPLISH IN TO THE REVENUE THAT THEY'LL GET BACK- DOESN'T COVER THE EXPENSE OF THEIR INVESTMENT. SO WE'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS LAST YEAR WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS- AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND TWO PROJECTS AT THE SAME TIME RIGHT SO A LIBRARY PLUS A SCHOOL PROJECT AND SO THAT BRINGS INTO PLAY TO E. RATE DISCOUNTS. AND THEN THE LIBRARIES USED- THERE'S I FORGOT THE NAME OF BUT IT'S ON THERE THERE'S A- WE HAVE A SIX MILLION DOLLAR POT OF MONEY FOR BROADBAND GRANTS. AND SO WE'VE BEEN USING FUNDS FROM BACK TO MAKE A TO MAKE THE STATE MATCH WHICH ALSO TRIGGERS- YEAH KIND OF A REDUCTION IN COST BY THE FEDS. BUT AT LEAST LAST YEAR ON THE PROJECTS WE DID WAS RUNNING AT A ONE DOLLAR FROM US. TEN DOLLARS BACK FROM THE FEDS RATIO. SO THIS THIRTY FIVE MILLION CONTEMPLATES TAKING THAT AND SO WE'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS LIKE FERNDALE AND- SHOOT WHAT'S OUT GARBER VILLE- WERE PROJECTS THAT IS. NOBODY IN THAT ON BECAUSE THEY WERE SO EXPENSIVE BUT MATT WAS ONE OF THE SUCCESSES LAST YEAR. ALSO JUST NEAR HERE IN SACRAMENTO- CLARKSBURG FOR EXAMPLE CONNECTING THE LIBRARY AND- ONCE ITS HIGH SCHOOL THERE- BUT THOSE WERE TWO SUCCESSES THAT CAME FROM THIS BUILDING. TO KINDS OF PROJECTS AT THE SAME TIME SO THAT THE INTENT OF THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION IS TO SAY OKAY. WELL LET'S DO. LIVE PLUS. PLUS TELEHEALTH WHICH TRIGGERS A THIRD- EAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT THIRTY RATE DISCOUNT OF MAIN BREAKS- EVEN MORE PROJECTS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO- PROVIDERS. CAN I ANY BETTER WAY TO LEVERAGE THOSE ALL THOSE DOLLARS THOSE POTS OF MONEY TO GET. SOME BROADBAND INCREASE IN THESE AREAS. YES. YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A UP ON THE ON THE- IS THERE STUFF MAYBE AND LOOKED AT. WELL FOR THAT WE WORTH. NORTHERN VALLEY DRASTIC COUNTY OF YOU KNOW THE- AREA AS WELL SISKIYOU. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS WHERE YOU KNOW THOSE THREE KIND OF SCHOOLS PLUS LIBRARIES PLUS TELEHEALTH ARE A PLATE AND A NUMBER OF THE PROJECT OUR END BUT IN ORDER THIS NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE I CAN'T SAY EXACTLY WHERE OKAY BUT I MEAN I'M HAPPY TO- WITH THE BROAD THE- PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING ON THIS AND SEE WHAT THEY COME UP WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE GOOD POSSIBILITIES. I IMAGINE SOME WILL BE AND SISKIYOU AND SHASTA. HOW ABOUT THIS I MEAN JUST THE ADMINISTRATION CAN YOU GUYS SPEAK TO THAT. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE EXPECT THINGS. AND VERY SWEET THANK YOU YOUR QUESTION. YES SO HOW TO THE ADMINISTRATION CAN YOU SPEAK TO HOW INTERNET ACCESS WOULD BE EXPANDED HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING THE STATE WOULD RECEIVE. AND WHAT THE BALANCE OF STATE ANOTHER FUNDS WOULD BE TO ACCOMPLISH THESE COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS. CHECK THE BRIANNA RENT THAT APARTMENT BINANCE AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE'LL BE WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH OUR LIBRARY COLLEAGUES IN TERMS THAT YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT IS THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN I WOULD KNOW THAT THAT IS THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM- BROADLY OF MY- COLLEAGUE MISTER WE GET MENTIONED YEAH WE DO INTEND PRETTY THANKS TO JOT DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS- ESTHER AND- OF THAT THE- AT THAT. SPECIFIC AMOUNT THAT WILL BE A TO DRIVE DOWN I WOULD TO. I WORK WITH MY LIBRARY COLLEAGUES ON THAT DATE AND GET BACK. HERE OKAY. ST LUCAS AGAIN. AS I SAID EARLIER OUR EXPERIENCE IN DOING. JOINT PROJECTS WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT K. THROUGH TWELVE LAST YEAR. WAS WE RECEIVED ROUGHLY. TEN DOLLARS. RIGHT IN FEDERAL MONEY FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT THE STATE PUT IN. SO IF WE PUT IT IN A MATCHING YOU KNOW A MATCHING. AMOUNT OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS RIGHT WE GET ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING MONEY COMING BACK. FOR THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY IN PROJECTS LIKE THIS THAT WE DID WITH IN PARTNERSHIP WITH K. THROUGH TWELVE- WE PUT IN ABOUT A MILLION AND SOME CHANGE AND GOT BACK THIRTEEN MILLION- IN FEDERAL MONEY YEAH. WELL THAT'S IT I OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A GREAT RATIO AND- AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT ISSUE EITHER YOU KNOW. I JUST WAS WONDERING IF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND MAY BE CALCULATED OUT WHAT THEY WERE ESTIMATING IN TERMS OF. FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WOULD COME IN. BASED ON THIS BUT I THINK THAT HELPS ANSWER MY QUESTION THANK YOU MISTER LUCAS YOU'RE WELCOME THANK YOU. OKAY- WE'RE GONNA HOLD THESE ISSUES OPEN AT THE ASSEMBLY WILL PROBABLY HAVE SOME IDEAS ON. OTHER STATE LIBRARY PROPOSALS AS WELL WE COME BACK WITH A PLAN NEXT WEEK. I WITH THAT FINAL ISSUE BEFORE PUBLIC COMMENT HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW WE CAN TRY TO DO THIS VERY BRIEFLY CARMINA FINANCE ELIA. SURE PRIMARILY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE THEM BUT A REVISION PROPOSES THREE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. FOR AN ALTERNATIVE CAMPUS PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM. HAPPY SIXTH. BAG GO AHEAD PLEASE CONTINUE. BOB THERE ARE CERTAIN PROGRESSIVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE VISION INCLUDES THREE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. FOR AN ALTERNATIVE CAMPUS PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM AT HASTINGS. OKAY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN PLAIN ENGLISH ALTERNATIVE CAMPUS PUBLIC SAFETY WE LIKE ALTERNATIVES WE LIKE ALL I'M TRYING TO BE BRIEF I KNOW WOULD LIKE TO TELL US REAL QUICK WHAT THAT MEANS SO THIS IS THEIR DIRE THE CAMPUS HAD SOME SECURITY INSTITUTION ISSUES AND TRADITIONAL PUBLICLY FUNDED POLICING AND ALSO PRIVATELY ADMINISTERED SECURITY GUARDS WERE NOT DOING THE TRICK. SO IN ORDER TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE SECURITY AROUND CAMPUS ISSUES THEY WORKED WITH URBAN ALCHEMY TO NON FOR PROFIT THE ONLY HIRES. FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS THAT USE ALTERNATIVE POLICING METHODS OR NOT POLICING METHODS BUT THEY ARE UNDER ALTERNATIVE TO POLICING. SO THEY DON'T CARRY GUNS THEY ARE TRAINED IN DE ESCALATION IN AND REFERRALS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACCEPT HER UP. AND SO THEY PROVIDED BY. WHAT HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN SAFETY AND WELLNESS AND WELL BEING FOR THE COMMUNITY AROUND AS THINGS THEY'VE DONE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO FOR EXAMPLE- TRYING TO INCREASE THE SORT OF TRADITIONAL IT'S A POLICING. OKAY SO THESE WILL BE ONE TIME RESOURCES TO BASICALLY GET THIS PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING. THAT'S CORRECT SO THEY PILOTED THIS PROGRAM FOR SIX MONTHS- IT'S ONGOING RIGHT NOW IN THE CURRENT YEAR PILOTED IF PARTLY IN RESPONSE TO COBIT. ABANDONMENT AND THIS THIS FUNDING WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THREE YEARS AND IT WOULD X. EXTEND THE PILOT AND FLOUR TO MOVE FORWARD. THE REASON FOR THE THREE YEAR TIMELINE IS SIMPLY THAT THE ONGOING IT IS UNCLEAR- THE SORT OF. SECURITY AND SANITATION ISSUES THAT THIS IS ADDRESSING ARE THEY HAVE BEEN DYNAMIC IN SHIP SHAPE SHIFTING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND SO GOING FOR ITS VERY- IT'S JUST AN UNKNOWN OKAY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIS HASTINGS I THINK NINE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN. RELATED TO THE SCHOOL FINANCE AUTHORITY SCHOLARS SHARE AN OFFICE PLANNING AND RESEARCH. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SAME ISSUE NUMBER. CHAVEZ WITH APARTMENT OF FINANCE. THREE OR WHAT.

I SPEND AND POLITICIAN FOR THIS PROPOSAL MY COLLEAGUES FROM FINANCE ARE ON THE LINE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IN THE PROPOSAL. ALSO DELTA ANTHONY CHAVEZ FROM THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS IS ON THE LINE. FOR THE PROGRAM TO QUESTION. NOT IS THE HIGHER. GEN HAPPEN. THE MAYOR OF A BECAUSE IT UP FOR. ONE TIME FUND AND HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT. EVENLY OVER TO. TWO BILLION TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND TWO. AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FINANCE AUTHORITY WILL ADMINISTER GRANTS THE THREE POT PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENT. IT DIDN'T HOUSING BUBBLE IN YOUR ADDRESS HOUSING INSECURITY BY COVERING THE UP FRONT COST OF HOUSING CONSTRUCTION OR HOUSING ACQUISITION AND RENOVATION AND INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF LOW. LOW COST UNIT HOUSING. TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS STUDENT COSTS DEPEND- LACK THERE. KEEP YOUR I. COLLABORATIVE THE NAY REVISION AND IN. IN THE OFFICE AND RESEARCHING. INTO LYING HIGH ALIGNING HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND RECENT REGIONAL WORK FORCE NEEDS. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES ALLOCATING THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND SATISFIED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM REGIONAL CATERING SIXTEEN COOPER IS. STOCKED WITH THE PLANNING AND RESEARCH WOULD PROVIDE GRANTS FOR COLLABORATIVE THAT INCLUDE AT LEAST ONE CAMPUS ALL THREE PUBLIC BECKMAN. THREE OCCUPATIONAL PATHWAYS THAT LEAD TO HIGH PAYING IN DEMAND JOBS AND ADOPT RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE HIGHER EDUCATION RECOVERY WITH EQUITY TASK FORCE. BUT THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU. L. A. L. YEAH I DIDN'T CONCENTRATE SOLELY- I WE REALIZE TIME IS SHORT SO WE WERE JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON THE TWO BIG ITEMS YET FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR STUDENT HOUSING AND THE ONE OF THE SCHOLARSHIP- CLOSE ALSO ALL I'LL TOUCH ON THE HOUSING ONE AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE WE STILL COVERAGE COLLEGE HERE. I JUST ON THE STUDENT HOUSING PROPOSAL WE'RE STILL WAITING ON THE TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T RELEASED IT YET- SO WE CAN'T OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AT THE MOMENT BOB BUT WE DO WANT TO RAISE A FEW ISSUES ISSUES FOR LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURES. FACTOR TO CONSIDER ON THIS ONE- COME ON THIS WOULD BE. OUR ONLY A NEW INITIATIVE REALLY IN APPROACH FOR THE STATE. HISTORICAL TO THE STATE HAS FOCUSED ITS OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES ON ACADEMIC FACILITIES. MR BE A NEW APPROACH BY FOCUSING ON OUR- SPENDING ON STUDENT HOUSING. IT'S ALSO A NEW APPROACH TO ADDRESSING AFFORDABILITY HISTORICALLY THE STATE HAS FOCUSED ITS SPENT ON SPENDING ON TOP FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS. HOW BECAUSE THIS IS NEARLY RAISES A FEW AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY FOR ONE IT'S HARD TO GAUGE THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE ON AFFORDABILITY. HAPPENS FOR EXAMPLE IT'S HARD TO GAUGE HOW MANY ADDITIONAL BEDS WERE PROVIDED HOW MANY STUDENTS TO BE IMPACTED BY IT. IT'S ALSO HARD TO PROJECT- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAMS IT'S HARD TO PROJECT WHETHER. CAMPUSES WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO. IRAN BUT HOUSING ON A CERTAIN KIND OF MIND. FINALLY IT'S A WANTS TO HOOK HOUSING UNITS ARE BILL- DEPENDING ON THE TRIM LEGISLATION AND DEPENDING ON THE LIMITS THAT ARE IMPOSING ON RENTAL RATES. IT'S HARD TO GAUGE THE ABILITY OF OTHER SEGMENTS MOVING FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO. MAINTAIN AND OPERATE THE FACILITIES. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT YOU A RESERVE FOR THE- COMMENTS. OKAY IN. COLLEGE STATING BOTH OVERLAPS WAITING PRO ACCOUNT GETS PROGRAM WHICH THE STATE END NINETEEN TO. UNDERSTANDING SCHEDULED TO LAUNCH THIS PROGRAM LATER THIS YEAR AND IT WILL BE AN ST ACCOUNT EVERY NEW KERR BUT IT'S THE OF THESE ON FACT THESE. MUCH LITERATURE FIVE FUNDING COLLEGE SAVINGS IN THE BUDGET GAP WE THINK COULD CONSIDER AUGMENTING THE EXISTING PROGRAM RATHER THAN CREATING A NEW ONE AND HAVING ONE COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT COULD BE EASIER FOR FAMILIES TO NAVIGATE THAT'S INCREASING LIKELY HAD THE BILLING CARE TRIVIALIZE. THE PROGRAM THANK YOU. SO THANK YOU. THAT OKAY I'M US SOME SOME SOME COMMENTS ON THESE TO THE LARGER ITEMS. WHEN I REALIZED THE OTHER ONE WELL- NOT AS LARGE AS TWO BILLION IS SIGNIFICANT TWELVE THAT CALLS FOR ALL SERVICE PROGRAM. THAT'S THIRTY MILLION ONE TIME. THANK ARE THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND SO THE FIRST PCS. OKAY OKAY. CATCH ALL COME BACK TO THAT SIHLTAL FIRST ON THE- ON THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE ASSEMBLY HAS HIS IS INTERESTED IN IN HIS SUPPORT OF UP TO DIVERT PEOPLE TRANSPARENCY I HAVE A BILL THAT WOULD DO. EXACTLY THIS CREATIVE REVOLVING FUND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING IT'S A BIG NEED AND FOR THE COST OF INSTRUCTION IS STUDENT HOUSING- WE DO SUPPORT THIS IS GOING TO- THE CAMPUS I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE MAJORITY OF IT GOING TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES JUST BECAUSE TALKING TO THEM LAST YEAR. AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT WERE LEAST LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN BILL STUDENT HOUSING AND OTHERS A COUPLE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL CAMPUSES BUT- REALLY IF YOU WANTED TO. FOCUS ON- GETTING THAT MONEY ON THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK IT'S THE UC AND CSU SEGMENT AND REALLY ADDRESS THE OTHER ISSUES WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WHICH IS ENROLLMENT ACCESS. NOT TO SAY THAT A STUDENT HOUSING IS AN ISSUE WITH OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS BUT JUST DON'T THIS DOESN'T SEEM OF THERE'S A LOT OF VIABLE. PROJECTS COULD THEY COULD JUST GET UP AND GOING NOW- YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE. AREVOLVING LOAN FUND- JUST GRANTS TO THE SEGMENTS I THINK WE'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WHEN IT IS. KNOWING THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND THERE'S A LOT OF IDEAS AND- AND REALLY SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS I THINK THIS IS. LIKE WE SAID EARLIER AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE WE JUST DON'T GO FAST BUT DO IT RIGHT AND REALLY BE THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE FOCUS ON STUFF NASA FOR BILLION. IN INVESTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- WE GET OUR BIGGEST BANG FOR A BUCK AND REALLY. FAT HE ENSURE THAT. YES TO HOUSING ANSWER ACTUALLY BUILT. AND THEY'RE PERSONALLY AFFORDABLE AND LASTLY. WE THINK THAT IT'S- IT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF TAXPAYERS TO HAVE THESE- UNIVERSITY BELTS. AND NOT BRING IN IN. THE PRIVATE SECTOR FOR THESE YOU KNOW PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS THEY KNOW THEY THEY SOUND GOOD BUT MANY TIMES ARE JUST. WALL STREET INVESTORS TRYING TO GET THERE. THERE ARE A WIDE ON THESE RATES AND SO YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP THE PRICES DOWN FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS. LIKE WE'VE SEEN IN. UNIVERSITY HOUSING THE UC UC SAN DIEGO FOR EXAMPLE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF DOING THIS SO- THOSE ARE OUR THOUGHTS ON THIS. THE SCHOLARS SHARES SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT WE'VE BEEN BANGING ON THIS FOR A FEW YEARS- THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE PERMANENT. THE COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. AND I'VE SEEN THIS LOCALLY WITH THE PROGRAM THAT I HELPED CREATE HERE WITH KINDERGARTEN TO COLLEGE THAT. KIDS AND FAMILIES WHO HAVE A COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT IN THEIR NAME. WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR HUNDRED DOLLARS OR- FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AS A TRUST FUND KID. THEY'RE ALL JUST AS LIKELY TO GO ON TO COLLEGE BECAUSE IT IT BUILDS UPON EXPECTATIONS OF COLLEGE- COLLEGE ATTENDANCE SO. CALLED ATTAINMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION ATTAINMENT SO THIS IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY I KNOW THAT SOME WHENEVER NECESSARY AND IT'S BEEN A LEADER IN THIS ISSUE. ALSO HAS LEGISLATION THAT YOU KNOW WE MAY KIND OF FINE TUNE THIS PROPOSAL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT ACTUALLY. AT WORK SO THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS ON THESE ON THESE TO LARGER ISSUES I KNOW- AT THE COMMITTEE OUR STAFF WE WILL. TAKE A LOOK IN THAT. THAT POTENTIALLY. FINE TUNE THE OTHER PIECES AS WELL. I ON THESE ISSUES AS WELL COMMENTS MEMBER. BY THAT IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER. YEAH SO IN REGARDS TO THE SAVING ACCOUNTS- THE MATE SO. THE MEMBERS OF ROSES TWO BILLION ONE TIME FEDERAL ARE PROMOTE DOLLARS TO ESTABLISH COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. FOR AN ESTIMATED THREE POINT SEVEN PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS GRADES ONE THROUGH SIX. SO IT'S JUST A FEW QUESTIONS ON HOW THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK IF WE'RE CREATING THESE ACCOUNTS FOR STUDENTS ONE TWO SIX ONE. WELL THE ACCOUNT BE THE ACCOUNT OF THE CHILD OR CHILD'S FAMILY'S. PREFERENCE BANKING PREFERENCE ONE TWO IF THESE CHILDREN LEAVE AS MANY MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES ARE LEAVING CALIFORNIA BECAUSE- IT'S EXPENSIVE TO LIVE HERE- WILL THEY STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THESE BONDS OR IS IT JUST TO BE SPENT IN CALIFORNIA. FOR CALIFORNIA COLLEGES- I'M JUST AND LASTLY. I'M TO GET TO- M. TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY INDIVIDUALS WITH CALLS ACCOUNTS MIGHT BE MORE SUCCESSFUL I'M A IT JUST IT ARE WE LOOKING AT A FROM A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE AND NOT YOU KNOW IF THE CHILD HAS EIGHTY COLLEGE ACCOUNT- SAVINGS ACCOUNT IS IT BECAUSE PARENTS ARE ENGAGED OR OR SOMEBODY IN THEIR LIFE THAT IS ENGAGED AND CONTINUALLY MOVING THEM FOR EXAMPLE RATHER THAN IT JUST BEING A REALLY YOU KNOW BASIC YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT NAMES YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO GO TO COLLEGE. SO- MAYBE V. M. M. DEPARTED FINANCE COMMAND ON THIS THANK YOU. YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I'LL TRY TO ANSWER ALL OF THEM- SO ON THE FIRST POINT OF LIKE SAY WE ARE THINKING ON THE CHANGE IN THE MINDSET OF THE STUDENT ONE STUDENT KNOWS THAT THERE ARE SOME MONEY SAVED FOR AT THE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO GO TO COLLEGE THERE IS A CHANGED. ARE WE ARE LOOKING AND HOW A LOT OF THE STUDENTS WHO WILL BE LOW INCOME- MAYBE THEIR PARENTS EXACTLY THEY DID NOT ATTEND COLLEGE THEY MAY NOT EVEN HAVE A CHECKING ACCOUNT. BUT THAT THE MINDSET OF THE STUDENT KNOWING THAT THERE'S MONEY SAVE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL IS GOING TO COLLEGE HAS A BIG IMPACT AND WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY REDUCTION AS A WAY TO START IN AN EARLY AGE- I THINK ONE OF YOUR OTHER QUESTION ONE AS TO WHAT HAPPENED IF THE STUDENT DOESN'T ATTEND COLLEGE- THE CURRENT TRAILER BILL INDICATES THAT. THE STUDENT HAS UNTIL IT TURNS THIRTY FIVE YEARS. OLD TO USE THAT SPACE. IF THEY DON'T THEM I THEN YOU WOULD JUST BE RIPPLE TO THE FOR. IT WILL USED FOR TO. INCLUDING WITH ALL THE MONEY THAT YOU MAKE GROW DURING THIS TIME. I WONDER IF I BASS ANY OTHER UP YOU'VE GOT AND SO THEN- SO THAT IS THE EXPECTATION THAT. WE WILL BE OPENING AN ACCOUNT FOR A CHILD IN CONTROL THAT ACCOUNT. A GOOD BILL WILL HAS THE COLLEGE INVEST BOARD THEY'LL BE ONE OPENING THE ASK EMPOWER TO STILL AND THERE WILL BE MANY THE TO. AND IS THERE AN YOU KNOW. A. AN OPT OUT IF FFM DOESN'T WANT OTHER. WE DO CURRENT TRAILER DOES NOT HAVE AN OPT OUT BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR SUGGESTIONS TO MANAGEMENT. OUR GOAL IS THAT IF NOT GIVEN THE OPTION TO EITHER OPT THAT OF. OR OFTEN AUTOMATICALLY THE STUDENT HAS THE SECOND GROWING UP AND WHEN THEY STUDENT DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT WANTS TO ATTEND TO. AND IT CREATION OF TRAINING PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTED THE PATIENT THEN AT THAT TIME HE CAN MAKE THAT HE OR SHE CAN MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. AND IS THERE A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING. TO OPEN THIS ACCOUNT. AT WE DON'T HAVE THAT AT THIS MOMENT THE TRAILER BILL ONLY INDICATES THAT IS CULTURE INVESTMENT WILL BE BEST SEEN AT THE SECOND. THANK YOU. YEAH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER IS THERE GOING TO BE A CAP ON ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGES FOR THOSE ACCOUNTS. I WOULD I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- IS THERE GONNA BE ANY DETERMINATION OF WHICH POST SECONDARY EDUCATION OR- OR BUSINESS VENTURES WOULD QUALIFY. FOR WITHDRAWAL OF THOSE FUNDS. OUR CURRENT TRAILER BILL REQUIRES SIMILAR TO THE CALKINS ACCOUNT- TO BE A POST SECONDARY EDUCATION OR A TRAINING PROGRAM AT THIS MOMENT GOOD DOES IT HAVE TO BE IN CALIFORNIA- COULD BE ANYWHERE. IT HAS TO BE IN CALIFORNIA OKAY. I MEAN IT JUST FROM THESE QUESTIONS LIKE. YOU KNOW. I JUST DON'T THINK THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF THOUGHT HAS BEEN PUT INTO HOW THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK YOU KNOW WHAT IF PEOPLE MOVE- YOU KNOW AS MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT- FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS DOESN'T GET YOU A WHOLE LOT IN CALIFORNIA LET'S JUST BE. VERY FRANK. AND FOR MANY OF THESE FAMILIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT ARE STRUGGLING. THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY TO PUT. YOU KNOW TO PAY FOR GROCERIES MAN LET ALONE. PUTTING MONEY INTO A SAVINGS ACCOUNT SO CHANCES ARE UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT COST OF LIVING IN. MOST WE DO SOMETHING ACTUALLY ABOUT AFFORDABILITY THIS JUST GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SITTING IN AN ACCOUNT- PROBABLY A MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT IS NOT GOING TO GAIN MUCH INTEREST- THAT. IS NOT GOING TO BE ALL THAT HELPFUL AND SO TO ME IT'S JUST IT'S ANOTHER FLUFF PROPOSAL. YEAH A LOT OF THIS ADMINISTRATION TO SAY LOOK WE'RE LOOK WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE GOING TO GIVE EVERYBODY FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS IN AN ACCOUNT. OKAY WELL WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION. TO MAKE IT MORE EQUITABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY KID TO SUCCEED WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING MORE ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE UC SYSTEM. TO ENSURE THAT MORE CALIFORNIA KIDS ARE GETTING INTO. UNIVERSITIES THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO AND I'D RATHER TAKE THAT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IN PUT INTO THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE THAT DIFFERENCE. RATHER THAN JUST SITTING INTO AN ACCOUNT. AND I'VE AND I FEEL LIKE ABOUT ALMOST ALL OF THESE PROVISIONS IN THIS LAST PROPOSAL THERE. A VERY FLAT PROVISIONS- YOU KNOW YES OF COURSE WE WANT MORE HOUSING I DON'T KNOW THAT THE CAMPUS IS. MANY OF THESE CAMPUSES WERE TALKING ABOUT DON'T HAVE AVAILABLE ROOMS EVEN BUILD THAT HOUSE YOU KNOW TO CONVERT SOMETHING FROM COMMERCIAL- LET ALONE LIKE. ME UP AMEND ELDEST DIVERGE FROM MY COLLEAGUE A LITTLE BIT ON THE SIDE THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO. MANAGE COSTS AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE DOING THIS IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY- BUREAUCRATIC COLLEGE COLLEGE CAMPUSES. I'M SORRY ARE NOT VERY GOOD BUILDERS AND NOT VERY GOOD AT BEING COST EFFECTIVE IT. PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING- SO TO THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BUILD. AFFORDABLE HOUSING- AT A REASONABLE LEVEL I THINK IS. AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW THIS PROGRAMS GOING TO WORK YOU KNOW AGAIN THERE'S NO IT NOT EVEN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE YET. ON IT IS JUST ANOTHER HEY WE'RE GONNA THROW TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT SOMETHING- THAT HOPEFULLY WILL RESULT IN MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING- FOR STUDENTS I I'D LIKE TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE TARGETED IN THAT- YOU KNOW THE YES OF COURSE I LOVE SCENE COLLEGE STUDENTS GETTING INVOLVED IN SERVICE I DON'T SEE WHY THEY CAN'T ALREADY DO THAT THROUGH THAT SO MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE AMERICORPS- YOU KNOW. TO NAME ONE BUT JUST SO MANY THAT SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES ARE ALREADY THERE BUT WE NEED TO SPEND. WHAT THIRTY MILLION MORE DOLLARS ON SOME KIND OF NEW PROGRAM THAT- WHEN THERE'S ALREADY EXISTING PROGRAM AGAIN IT'S JUST TOO IS THE SAME INDICATION OF MORE FLUFF THAT I'D RATHER PUT THAT MONEY. IN THE THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THROUGHOUT THIS COMMITTEE HEARING THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO MAKE MUCH MORE OF A DIFFERENCE. FOR KIDS EDUCATIONAL LONG TERM SO- JUST LOOKING AT THESE SONIC. ON WHAT WE'VE GOT THE FORCE WITH LIKE PRETTY MUCH NO LANGUAGE AND NO DETAILS THAT I DON'T THINK I CAN BE VERY SUPPORTIVE. OF REALLY ANY OF THESE MEASURES AT THIS POINT. OKAY. WELL. HE HIT SOMEONE'S RESPONDING THERE GOOD. S. HI FRIENDS WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE I DID JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT FOR THE CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WE DO HAVE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- THAT IT POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE AND THE FUNDS THEMSELVES FOLLOW THE STUDENT SO THEY DID NOT HAVE TO BE IS THE TYPICALLY AT A CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION THE TRAILER BILL CLASSIFIES THE FUNDING TO BE USED. FOR QUALIFIED HIGHER EDUCATION EXPENSES AND OUR EXPECTATION. THAT THAT THOSE FUNDS WOULD POLITICS TO THAT. YES I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY AND ALLOW FOR FORWARD THAN AT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIS RESEARCH ON COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AND THIS WAS AN IDEA THAT WAS THE ASSEMBLY'S PROPOSAL BEFORE. THE GUN WHEN GAVIN IS A LIST OF THE TEN A GOVERNOR AND SO HE'S- EMBRACE THIS AND HE KNOWS THIS BECAUSE IN SAN FRANCISCO. THE CITY TREASURER THERE CREATED ONE OF THE FIRST ONES IN THE NATION. ALONG WITH SOME STATES LIKE OKLAHOMA- IN SOME PLACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT HAD DONE THIS AND SHOWN IT VERY SUCCESSFUL WHERE THEY PICK THEY PICK KINDERGARTENERS. AND THEY CREATED THESE THESE COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WHICH I KNOW THAT I CREATED FOR MY- MY KIDS I'M NOT SURE IF YOU GUYS HAVE TWO ENDS FIVE TWENTY NINES THEY'RE- THEY'RE PORTABLE AND THEY CAN BE USED FOR ANY COLLEGE. ATTENDANCE ACROSS THE NATION AND IF YOU COULD DOESN'T GO TO COLLEGE. YOU CAN GIVE IT TO ANOTHER CHILD IN YOUR FAMILY OR ANOTHER THAT DOES NEED FOR ANOTHER. INDIVIDUAL AND IF THEY EVENTUALLY ARE WITHDRAWN THERE'S MASSIVE PENALTIES YOU PAY ON THAT SHOW IN THIS CASE WTH THE MONEY GO BACK TO THE STATE OF FAMILY LOVE TO. LOOK AT OOK AT THAT. BUT BUT I WILL SAY THAT YOU KNOW YES FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ISN'T GOING TO. MAKE OR BREAK GOING TO COLLEGE- YOU KNOW MR GALLAGHER BUT- IF THE IF THAT. ENVELOPE CONS IN YOUR HOUSE. YOU KNOW THREE TIMES A YEAR. EVERY QUARTER BEFORE TENS A YEAR. AND HAS THAT KIDS NAME FOR COLLEGE THEN THE FAMILY STARTS THINKING ABOUT NOW WHEN THEY HAVE A BIRTHDAY PARTY MAYBE SO YOU KNOW WHAT. NO GETS BRING. TWENTY DOLLARS YOU CAN DEPOSIT IN THAT COLLEGE FUND. AND THERE'S BEEN RESEARCH UPON RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT REALISTIC REALLY. DOES INCREASE. S. OF CALL. ATTAIN AND THIS IS A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IN OUR ECONOMY WE NEED MORE PEOPLE GOING TO COLLEGE THAT THE SYSTRACE IT WE HAVE THIS. THIS MASSIVE DEFICIT OF COLLEGE GRADUATES THE NEXT YOU KNOW FIVE TO TEN YEARS THAT. P. P. I. C. TALKS ABOUT. AND WE NEED MORE PEOPLE- PREPARING AND GOING ON TO COLLEGE SO. THIS HAS BEEN- RESEARCHED AND SHOWN TO WORK ACROSS OUR OUR COUNTRY ON THE GLOBE. AND IT'S BEEN BIPARTISAN I'LL GIVE YOU THAT THIS HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY. YOU KNOW REPUBLICAN U. S. SENATORS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY AS WELL. AND I THINK THAT IT'S A REALLY SOUND INVESTMENT I'M EXCITED CALIFORNIA IS STEPPING UP WE DO NEED TO- MAKE SURE THAT WE IMPLEMENTED. WELL SO DID THE TRAILER BILL BUT ALSO WE HAVE SOMEONE IS THERE AND HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS LEGISLATION FOR TWO YEARS. AND THAT IT IS NOT WE DON'T USE THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN SCHOLARSHIP. THERE ARE THEIR PREEMINENCE TO SEND. IN THE COUNTRY IN INVESTING MONEY FOR COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT SO WE DON'T HAVE TO YOU KNOW FOCUS ON. IS GOING TO BE THAT. THE BANK WE ALREADY HAVE YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL IT'S OURS IT'S OUR SCHOLARSHIP. SAVING STRESSED AND THEN FOR THE STUDENT HELP FOR THE STUDENT HOUSING. I AGREE I AGREE MR GALLAGHER WE SHOULDN'T DO ANYTHING NEW AND COMPLICATED WE SHOULD JUST. HOW DO WE HELP OUR CAMPUSES BUILD MORE STUDENT HOUSING WHETHER IT'S SEX ST CHICO UC. SAN DIEGO SANTA BARBARA FULLER TEN WHEREVER THEY THERE'S NOT ENOUGH STUDENT HOUSING ON THESE CAMPUSES. AND THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE REASON WHY STUDENTS. SPEND SO MUCH MONEY IS THE NON TUITION COSTS INCLUDING HOUSING SO. ALWAYS CAMPUS HAVE LANDS WE TALK TO THE CHANCELLORS AND PRESIDENTS LAST YEAR AND A HALF. AND THEY SAID WE WOULD LOVE. TO BUILD MORE STUDENT HOUSING BUT WE COULD WE COULD IT COULD REALLY HELP US IF WE HAVE- ZERO INTEREST LOANS OR GRANTS TO HELP US FINANCE STUDENT HOUSING ON OUR CAMPUSES AND SO. THIS IS WHAT- THE MONEY OUR OUR OUR INDICATION. IT'LL BE USED FOR AND WE'RE GOING TO FINE TUNE THE APOSTLE TO MAKE SURE IT ACTUALLY TO WORK. SO WITH THAT- FURTHER FURTHER QUESTIONS- THING NINE WE WILL HOLD THESE ISSUES OPEN AND IT'S- NEARLY ONE O'CLOCK AND SO WE WILL NOW. AND PROCEED TO PUBLIC. I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE.
