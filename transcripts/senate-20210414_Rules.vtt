THE OTHER STATE HOSPITALS- THE

00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:34.266

DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER SHE SAID.

00:25:35.767 --> 00:25:36.801
I THINK THAT WAS KIND OF A

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:38.637
HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT THEY

00:25:38.703 --> 00:25:39.070

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.088
ALMOST HAVE A MASS EXODUS OF

00:25:57.155 --> 00:25:59.124
STAFF AND I STILL HAVE TO

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:04.195
OPERATE A FACILITY AND I IS.

00:26:04.262 --> 00:26:05.363

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.745
SICK STRUGGLE WITH STAFFING.

00:26:20.812 --> 00:26:22.113
AND SO THAT'S OF REASON BUT

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.515
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DO NEED

00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:25.717
TO WORK ON AND I LIKE I COMMIT

THE CLOSURE DETERMINATION AND-

00:26:41.032 --> 00:26:42.400
WAS THERE EVEN AN ECONOMIC

00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:44.569
IMPACT STUDY DONE ON HOW MUCH

00:26:44.636 --> 00:26:45.670
THE CLOSURE WILL AFFECT THE

00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:47.038
SURROUNDING COMMUNITY LOCAL

BUSINESSES CURRENT EMPLOYEES IN

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.677
THE PRISON IN SUSANVILLE. AND

00:26:52.744 --> 00:26:54.546
THE FACT THAT- THERE ARE HIGH

00:26:54.612 --> 00:26:56.114

PARADISES IN THAT COMMUNITY IN

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.986
THAT AREA- I BELIEVE CAMPFIRE

00:27:01.052 --> 00:27:03.121
IS IN THAT AREA. AND THAT'S

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:04.756
WHERE THE TRAIN INCARCERATED

00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:06.257
INDIVIDUALS TO FIGHT THESE

00:27:06.324 --> 00:27:07.625
FIRES IN THAT HIGH PRONE

00:27:07.692 --> 00:27:12.664
MOUNTAIN AREA- JUST- IT FOR

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:14.766
REFERENCE I HAVE A BUSINESS IN

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:17.068

00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:18.670
WHEN THEY TRAIN THEY DO

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:20.105
SPECIFIC TRAINING FOR SPECIFIC

00:27:20.171 --> 00:27:21.673
JOBS IF IT'S IN THE DESERT THEY

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.575
TRAIN IN THE DESERT THEY DON'T

00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:24.175
TRAIN AT THE BEACH AND THEN GO

00:27:24.242 --> 00:27:26.811
PERFORMING THE DESERT. AND SO-

00:27:26.878 --> 00:27:28.046
THE TRAINING THAT'S OFFERED IN

00:27:28.113 --> 00:27:29.381
THIS COMMUNITY UP THERE IS A

00:27:29.447 --> 00:27:31.249
MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY. BECAUSE

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:32.484
FIGHTING FIRES AND CLIMBING UP

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.818
AND DOWN HILLS IS WAY DIFFERENT

00:27:33.885 --> 00:27:35.587
THAN FIGHTING FIRES ON A FLAT

00:27:35.653 --> 00:27:37.889
LANDSCAPE. AND SO COULD YOU

00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:40.058

FIRE CAMPS WILL REMAIN INTACT-

00:27:48.733 --> 00:27:51.870
WITH THEIR SINGING STOCKING AND

00:27:51.936 --> 00:27:52.837
THE SAME POPULATION. THE FIRE

00:27:52.904 --> 00:27:54.806
TRAINING COMPONENT THAT IS

00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:57.175
CURRENTLY AT CCC WILL TRANSFER

00:27:57.242 --> 00:27:59.344
TO SIERRA CONSERVATION CENTER

00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:01.079
FOR THAT EXACT SAME TRAINS THEY

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:02.380
ALREADY HAVE THE FACILITY

00:28:02.447 --> 00:28:04.015
THERE. THEY CURRENTLY TRAINED

00:28:04.082 --> 00:28:05.350

CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE SECTION

00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:25.070
TWENTY SIXTY SEVEN AND FIVE

ARE FACILITIES FOR CLOSURE.

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.876
THAT INCLUDES COST AND I THINK

00:28:31.943 --> 00:28:32.977
I'VE I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE

00:28:33.044 --> 00:28:34.979
RECOUP THE COSTS THE IMPACT OF

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:38.716
THE CLOSURE OF THE WORK FORCE-

00:28:38.783 --> 00:28:40.085
AND I SAID ALL THOSE OTHER

00:28:40.151 --> 00:28:41.219
THINGS EARLIER BUT HE DID NOT

00:28:41.286 --> 00:28:43.822
INCLUDE- AND ACADEMIC- EXCUSE

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:46.524
ME AND- ECONOMIC IMPACT AND

00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:48.026
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT

00:28:48.093 --> 00:28:50.829
INCLUDED- IN. THAT PENAL CODE

00:28:50.895 --> 00:28:52.363
SECTION BUT CERTAINLY SOMETHING

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.566
TO EVALUATE WILL CERTAINLY NOT

00:28:54.632 --> 00:28:57.502
LOST ON ME THAT YOU KNOW. THE

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:59.070
TWO PERSONS UP THERE AND SUSAN

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:02.207
BELL IS THE PRIMARY EMPLOYERS.

00:29:02.273 --> 00:29:03.241
ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT WE HAVE

00:29:03.308 --> 00:29:05.009
TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AND

00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:07.345
FORCE FOR PICKING A LOCATION

00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:09.547
WHICH IS THE FACT THAT ANNUALLY

00:29:09.614 --> 00:29:10.415
WE HAVE TO SEND UP

00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:12.150
APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED NEW

00:29:12.217 --> 00:29:14.919
CADETS. UP TO THAT LOCATION I

00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:16.121
THINK IT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

00:29:16.187 --> 00:29:18.389
EACH- AND SO IT'S LIKE A

00:29:18.456 --> 00:29:20.859
REVOLVING DOOR STAFF GO THERE.

00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:23.528
THEY DON'T WANT TO- STAY SO

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:24.662
THEY LEAVE THEY THEY WAIT TO

00:29:24.729 --> 00:29:26.397
TIME DEVELOP LATERALLY TRANSFER

00:29:26.464 --> 00:29:28.733
CAL. THAT'S FOR THE- THE

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.802
CUSTANCE OUT MAJORITY OF OUR

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:34.439
NON CUTS TO STAFF ARE PRETTY-

00:29:34.506 --> 00:29:35.673
STATIONARY STAFF IN THE FROM

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.276
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. I WILL SAY

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:39.077
THAT OBVIOUSLY THESE

00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:41.012
NEGOTIATION PROCESS FOR ANY

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:46.851
KIND- TRANSFER OR REAL. OF

00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:47.752
STAFF. BUT ONE OF MY

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.587
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE TEAM

00:29:49.654 --> 00:29:51.623
THAT'S DEVELOPING THIS IS

00:29:51.689 --> 00:29:53.091
DEFINITELY AFFORD AN

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:54.459
OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:56.528
NOT FROM THAT COMMUNITY TO BE

00:29:56.594 --> 00:29:58.796
ABLE TO TRANSFER OUT. SO THAT

00:29:58.863 --> 00:30:00.865
THE WHAT. ARE THE MEMBERS FROM

00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:02.100
THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN BORN

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:03.468
AND RAISED IN DEDICATED THEIR

00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:08.173

00:30:10.341 --> 00:30:12.510
DON'T A JOB RESIDENTS BUT THOSE

00:30:12.577 --> 00:30:14.312
ARE THE STAFF TO GET TO REMAIN

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:15.880
PLANES. SO WE WILL WORK VERY

00:30:15.947 --> 00:30:17.949
VERY DILIGENTLY OBVIOUSLY WE

00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:19.484
HAVE UNION NEGOTIATIONS TO GO

00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:21.052
THROUGH BUT WE DEFINITELY HAVE

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:22.554
MY COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.522

00:58:52.128 --> 00:58:54.030
HOW I DO BELIEVE THAT LEAVES.

00:58:54.097 --> 00:58:55.698

THEY'RE STILL THEY- PEOPLE NEED

00:59:28.264 --> 00:59:29.565
TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH

00:59:29.632 --> 00:59:30.800
THEIR FAMILIES PEOPLE ARE NOT

00:59:30.867 --> 00:59:32.268
WE DON'T HAVE FAMILIES THAT

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:34.470
LIVE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO

WHERE THEY ARE BEING HOUSED-

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:37.974
AND IT WILL DRASTICALLY

00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:40.243
ALLEVIATE- THE ISSUES AROUND

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:42.211
CONTRABAND CONFISCATION IN

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:43.913
EVERY SINGLE I MEAN YOU POP OUT

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.049
OF A WALL NOWADAYS AND SOMEONE

00:59:46.115 --> 00:59:49.319
IS GIVING YOU A FINAL. SO I-

00:59:49.385 --> 00:59:51.254
THINK WE JUST HAVE TO LIVE IN

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:52.188
REALITY WHEN WE ARE TALKING

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:54.490
ABOUT. TECHNOLOGY AND DEVICES

00:59:54.557 --> 00:59:55.858
AND HOW PEOPLE COMMUNICATE AND

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:57.193
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.562
THERE'S CURRENCY AN ECONOMY

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:00.063
THAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR

01:00:00.129 --> 01:00:03.599
PRISONS. AND USING THAT AS AN

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:08.404
OPPORTUNITY TO- RESTRICT OR TO

01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:12.976
VIOLATE OR TO- CONTINUE TO

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:15.311
PUNISH IS NOT HOW WE'RE GOING

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:16.546
TO MOVE THROUGH THIS WE JUST

01:00:16.612 --> 01:00:17.947
HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.615
FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING

01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:21.284
IN PRISON ARE STILL NEEDING TO

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:22.552
COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR LOVED

01:00:22.618 --> 01:00:27.256
ONES. I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION

01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:29.392
ABOUT FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING-

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:32.161
INCARCERATED FOLKS WORKING- AND

01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:34.397
THE WAGES THAT THEY EARN. AND

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:36.132
WANT TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:38.735
THAT- THERE ARE NONE OF THERE'S

01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.436
A NATIONWIDE DISCUSSION AROUND.

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:42.138
SLAVE LABOR HAPPENING IN THE

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:44.874
PRISONS. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:46.843
THERE ARE SOME VENDORS WHO

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:50.079

PRESENT. THOSE SAME COMPANIES.

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:58.888
WILL NOT HIRE THEM WHEN THEY

01:00:58.955 --> 01:01:04.627
GET OUT. WHICH I THINK IS.

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:07.196
IRONIC TO SAY THE LEAST. BUT

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:09.132
THEY CERTAINLY WANT TO GET THE

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:10.700
LABOR OF THE PERSON WHILE

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:11.968
THEY'RE INCARCERATED BECAUSE

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:14.971
THE WAGES ARE SO LOW SO I WOULD

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:17.340

GOOD DISCUSSION THAT'S

WHAT CDCR SAYS IN THE MISSION-

01:10:58.053 --> 01:10:58.587

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:09.965
TO HAPPEN FOR DISCRIMINATORY

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:11.767
PRACTICES AGAINST OUR TRANS

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:13.936
COMMUNITY BUT ALSO AND FOR

HAPPENING IN OUR PRISONS ACROSS

01:11:17.806 --> 01:11:19.274
THE STATE AND I KNOW THAT

WAS VERY VERY MUCH IN THE NEWS

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:04.499
AND WE HAVE THE FEDERAL.

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:06.201
MANDATE TO REDUCE- ISN'T

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:07.802
POPULATION AT THAT TIME THERE

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:11.139
WAS BUDGET. OF ALLOCATION FOR A

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:12.774
BUILDING PRISONS ANDWE'VE GONE

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:13.642
THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE WE'RE NOW

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:15.677
LOOKING AT. A CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:20:15.744 --> 01:20:17.245
REFORM AND YOU KNOW THAT WE HAD

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:18.647
A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT I AM

01:20:18.713 --> 01:20:20.348
VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.

01:20:20.415 --> 01:20:21.283
IT WOULD BE NICE OF THESE

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:23.752
FACILITIES THAT ARE BEING CLOSE

01:20:23.818 --> 01:20:25.387
TO WOULD IN FACT- B.

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:27.088
REHABILITATION CENTERS WHERE

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:28.290
PEOPLE COULD GO FOR THOSE

01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:29.491
SPECIAL PROGRAMS BUT THAT'S%

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:31.459
SOMETHING. THAT I MIGHT ASK

01:20:31.526 --> 01:20:33.795
THOUGH THE FACILITIES- OF.

01:20:33.862 --> 01:20:35.463
CANDIDATE THAT YOU'RE TELLING

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:37.399
ME THAT THERE WAS A HUNDRED

01:20:37.465 --> 01:20:38.600
SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND. IT'S

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.602
NOW DOWN TO NINETY FIVE

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:41.603
THOUSAND IN ONLY THE TO PRESENT

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:44.139
YOU MENTIONED. THERE'S A 45%

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:46.608
CAPACITY- SO THAT LEAVES A LOT

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.243
OF ROOM OUT FAILED TO ONE OF

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:50.378
THE FACILITIES THE 65% CAPACITY

01:20:50.445 --> 01:20:51.513
AT THE OTHER ONE WHICH MEANS

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:52.414
THEY'RE STILL PROVIDING

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.416
SERVICES. AND THOSE ON THE

01:20:54.482 --> 01:20:55.417
CLOSURE LIST SO WE HAVE NO

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:59.154
IDEA. WHAT'S THE STANDARDS ARE

01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:00.622
FOR DETERMINING THAT. WE'VE

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:01.723
HEARD FROM YOU SOME OF THOSE

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:03.258
BUT I THINK WE NEED THAT IN

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:05.427
WRITING BECAUSE THEN. WHEN WE

01:21:05.493 --> 01:21:06.628
ARE STANDING UP FOR YOUR

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:08.363
CONFIRMATION OR STANDING UP TO

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:10.632
SAY THAT. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:13.435
CHALLENGING JOB THAT YOU'VE-

01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:15.370
YOU. YOU'LL COME BACK AND TAKE

01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:16.338
DO YOU WANT TO RECONSIDER THAT

01:21:16.404 --> 01:21:19.040
RIGHT AWAY. I JUST THINK THAT

01:21:19.107 --> 01:21:22.344
IF YOU DON'T EVEN. I CAN SEE

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:23.745
YOU STANDING UP AND RUNNING OUT

01:21:23.812 --> 01:21:26.081
OF THE ROOM YET SO ANYWAY I

01:21:26.147 --> 01:21:27.315
THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:29.084
BECAUSE WHEN WE DO THAT AND I'M

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:30.719
SPEAKING OF A LACK OF OFFICIAL

01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:32.387
ONE I CAN SHARE WITH MY

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:34.289
CONSTITUENTS THE SPECIFICS OF

01:21:34.356 --> 01:21:36.891
WHY HIGHER VOTED. WHY A PERSON

01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:39.294
ARE I AM TOTALLY COMMITTED TO

01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:41.129
THAT PERSON OR THAT ISSUE OR

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:43.265
AND I SHOW THEM THE DATA THEY

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:45.000
MIGHT NOT ALL AGREE AGREE WITH

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:46.167
ME BUT THEY HAVE TO TAKE MY

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:47.669
FINAL DECISION AND I DON'T DO

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:50.171
THAT WITHOUT PROVIDING SOME

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:52.007
EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE AND THAT'S

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:53.742
WHAT'S MISSING HERE. CANNOT

01:21:53.808 --> 01:21:55.176
THAT YOU'RE WORTHY OF THE GOLD

01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:57.145
HOLDEN THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE

01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:58.647
TO COMMUNICATE THAT SO I WAS

01:21:58.713 --> 01:22:00.582
JUST SAYING BETWEEN NOW AND

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:03.018
WHEN WE ARE READY TO DISCUSS

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:05.954
THIS- IN THE CHAMBERS I OUR

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:08.323
SESSION. EACH ONE OF US WILL BE

01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:10.058
ABLE TO STAND TALL WITH THE

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:11.493
QUESTIONS COME OUT FOR MY

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:13.461
COLLEAGUES AND WE WILL HAVE

01:22:13.528 --> 01:22:14.963
SOME OF THE DATA THAT WAS USED

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:16.631
TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS AND IN

01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:18.400
PARTICULAR THAT MEANS SHARE

01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:22.604
THAT WHEN WE'RE AT 45% 265% THE

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:24.306
QUESTION IS WHY THAT BLOCKED.

01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:25.540
THE LESS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE AN

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:30.412
EMPTY PRISON LIKE. MY

01:22:30.478 --> 01:22:31.780

MANAGER. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THE

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:34.082
WHOLE DIFFERENT THING AND IF

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:35.216
THERE'S AN EMPTY FOR. THERE

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:36.584
THAT OPENS DISCUSS ABOUT THE

01:22:36.651 --> 01:22:37.919
OTHER NEEDS THAT WE HAVE WITH

01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:39.421

AND ON AND ON AND THOSE ARE

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:44.125
THINGS THAT. ARE BECOMING

01:22:44.192 --> 01:22:46.094
EXTREMELY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

01:22:46.161 --> 01:22:48.263
POLICY WISE. FOR OUR

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:50.799
LEGISLATION IN OUR LEGISLATURE.

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:54.836
SO YOU JUST HAVE MY FIVE FIVE-

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:57.172
VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE BUT- I TO

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:58.973

QUICK ON ON THE- DIFFERENT

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:08.717
ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP IN

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:10.352
IF THERE IS. SOMETHING SPECIFIC

01:23:10.418 --> 01:23:12.153
IN TERMS OF A- STANDARD THAT IS

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.322
USED FOR ECONOMIC IMPACT. THAT

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:15.657
SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS NEEDS TO

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:17.058
BE DEVELOPED BECAUSE I THINK

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:18.927
WILL BE VERY CONVINCING. THAT

01:23:18.993 --> 01:23:20.595
WE NEED TO GO THIS WAY AND NOT

01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:21.496
THAT WAY BUT WHEN YOU'RE

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:24.532

TOWN. IN TERMS OF JOB

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:39.781

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:48.390
IMPORTANT FOR. OUR COLLEAGUES

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:49.858

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:28.209
THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT THERE ARE

01:27:28.276 --> 01:27:29.877
LESS PEOPLE TO GO INTO THE FIRE

01:27:29.944 --> 01:27:32.080
CAMPS FROM THE SYSTEM. AND THAT

01:27:32.146 --> 01:27:33.581

01:28:27.402 --> 01:28:28.870
DIFFERENT WAY IT'S REALLY BEEN

01:28:28.936 --> 01:28:30.138
DRIVEN HOME AND NOT IN THE

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:32.006
CONVERSATION THUS FAR BUT AS

TIME. YOU JUST GO IT 80%

01:28:57.331 --> 01:28:59.133

CLOSE OTHERS. WHAT IS THE

01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:08.776
DECISION MAKING FOR DEALING

01:29:08.843 --> 01:29:11.345
WITH THE REDUCTION UP AGAINST

01:29:11.412 --> 01:29:12.947
THE FACILITIES THAT EXIST IN

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:16.317
THE SYSTEM. F. N. THIS IS JUST

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:18.553
GRANTING. ARE THE OTHER

01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:20.288
QUESTIONS THAT YOU'LL RESPOND

01:29:20.354 --> 01:29:22.223
ON THE CRITERIA FOR THE

01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:23.991
SPECIFIC CLOSURES BUT IT SEEMS

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:24.826
TO ME THERE'S JUST LARGER

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:26.928
POLICY QUESTION- SYSTEM IS BEEN

01:29:26.994 --> 01:29:30.965
DOWNSIZING AND POPULATION. HOW

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:31.466
DO YOU RESPOND WITH THE

01:29:31.532 --> 01:29:34.135
FACILITIES. THANK YOU SIR AS

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:35.937
YOU NOW- SOME OF THE CRIMINAL

01:29:36.003 --> 01:29:39.674
JUSTICE REFORMS WERE- CONNECT

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:43.077
HIM TO STABILIZE. OUR COURT

01:29:43.144 --> 01:29:46.347
COMMITMENTS TO WHAT WE CALL THE

01:29:46.414 --> 01:29:48.049
THREE JUDGE PANEL WE HAVE A

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:50.284
COURT ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR

01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:53.054
OVERALL STATE POPULATION A

01:29:53.121 --> 01:29:53.688
HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:55.490
PERCENT. SO SOME OF THOSE

01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:58.860
INITIATIVES AND CHANGES WAS TO

01:29:58.926 --> 01:30:00.561
BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT

01:30:00.628 --> 01:30:03.598
GOAL. AND SO- THAT'S WHAT

01:30:03.664 --> 01:30:05.533
STARTED THE INITIAL PUSH AND

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:08.402
REALIGNMENTS ARE REALIGNMENT

01:30:08.469 --> 01:30:11.339
WAS- COMPLETED YEAH ASSEMBLY

01:30:11.405 --> 01:30:13.908
BILL ONE ON NINE AND TWO

01:30:13.975 --> 01:30:15.443
THOUSAND AND ELEVEN. AND THAT

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:17.879
SO IT TOOK THAT SAME LOW LEVEL

01:30:17.945 --> 01:30:19.480
OF GENDER NON SERIOUS

01:30:19.547 --> 01:30:22.850
NONVIOLENT NON SEX OFFENDERS TO

01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:26.220
SERVE THEIR TIME AT THE COUNTY

01:30:26.287 --> 01:30:28.623
JAIL. OBVERSES TO STATE PRISON

01:30:28.689 --> 01:30:29.857
AND SO THAT'S REALLY THE

01:30:29.924 --> 01:30:33.127
BIGGEST CHANGE- THERE WERE

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:35.196
OTHER CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:36.931
TO DAHLE ALONG THE WAY BUT I

01:30:36.998 --> 01:30:38.199
WOULD SAY WAS THE MARKET

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:40.535
DIFFERENCE SH AND SO AS WE GO

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:43.004
FORWARD. I WILL SAY THAT WE

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:45.506
HAVE TO PAUSE AND REEVALUATE

01:30:45.573 --> 01:30:47.608
POST CODE. WHAT WE HAVE

01:30:47.675 --> 01:30:49.644
DISCOVERED IS ARE OPEN DORM

01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:52.680
SETTINGS VERSUS CELLS WITH

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:55.082
SOLID SOUTH CORRIDORS. IT IS

01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:58.019
DIFFERENT. MARKET IN DIFFERENT

01:30:58.085 --> 01:31:00.021
AND SO WE HAVE TO PAUSE IN

01:31:00.087 --> 01:31:01.556
REIMAGINE WHAT THAT'S GOING TO

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:04.725
LOOK LIKE- YOU KNOW I SAY OUR

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:07.461
POPULATION IS AT NINETY FIVE

01:31:07.528 --> 01:31:09.664
THOUSAND BUT WE DO HAVE. LIKE

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:10.264
TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE

01:31:10.331 --> 01:31:12.333
COUNTY JAILS THAT HAS ADVERSELY

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:14.936
BEEN IMPACTING THE COUNTY JAILS

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:16.037
AND SHERIFFS HAVE BEEN VERY

01:31:16.103 --> 01:31:18.773
VERY VOCAL ABOUT THAT

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:22.376
UNDERSTANDABLY SO BECAUSE WE

01:31:22.443 --> 01:31:23.177
HAVE WE WERE CLOSE TO AND TAKE.

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:24.846

01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:31.485
BEEN COVERT DO DEF TEN THOUSAND

01:31:31.552 --> 01:31:33.387
MORE PEOPLE. IN THE SYSTEM

01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:34.222
BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:31:34.288 --> 01:31:35.223
TRANSFERRED DURING THAT PERIOD

01:31:35.289 --> 01:31:39.727
OF TIME. YES SIR OKAY. AND MANY

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:42.463
HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM THAT-

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:44.932
COUNTY JAILS AFTER AFTER THEIR

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:48.970
CREDIT IS APPLIED- WE TOOK IT

01:31:49.036 --> 01:31:50.137

YEARS ALL LAST SO MANY TIMES A

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:55.743
POPULATIONS ACTUALLY POLLING

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:58.012
BIKES FROM THE COUNTY JAIL AND

01:31:58.079 --> 01:31:59.780
I WORK WITH INDIVIDUAL SHERIFFS

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:02.250
ON THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS- AS IT

01:32:02.316 --> 01:32:03.584
RELATES TO BRING AN END BASED

01:32:03.651 --> 01:32:04.986
ON THEIR OWN OVERCROWDING

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:08.723
ISSUES- BUT I WILL SAY WE HAVE

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:10.157
TO REALLY CONSIDER WHAT ARE WE

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:14.662

HAPPENED TO THE PRISON

01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:28.142
POPULATION IN THE LATE EIGHTIES

01:32:28.209 --> 01:32:30.511
EARLY NINETIES. THAT WAS BASED

01:32:30.578 --> 01:32:32.680
ON LAW CHANGES THAT THINGS

01:32:32.747 --> 01:32:34.582
CHANGED WE'RE NOW KIND OF

01:32:34.649 --> 01:32:36.050
REVERSING SOME OF THAT WITH

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:37.752
REALIGNMENT SOME OF THE CREDIT

01:32:37.818 --> 01:32:39.320
EARNING CHANGES THAT HAVE

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:41.355
SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGED. THE

01:32:41.422 --> 01:32:43.491
PROPOSITION THIRTY SIX WITH THE

01:32:43.557 --> 01:32:45.293
THIRD STRIKE LAW FOR A NON

SERIOUS NONVIOLENT. ALL OF THE

01:32:47.628 --> 01:32:49.597
LAWS ACTUALLY IMPACT THE

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:51.599
POPULATION FOR HOW LONG THEY

01:32:51.666 --> 01:32:54.802

01:33:01.575 --> 01:33:04.545
GRANTS. IT HAS IT HAS INCREASED

01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:05.846

THE LAST YOU KNOW THROUGH BUT I

01:33:08.115 --> 01:33:09.550
THINK YOU'RE DOING A REALLY

01:33:09.617 --> 01:33:11.852
GOOD JOB OF DESCRIBING WHAT THE

01:33:11.919 --> 01:33:14.288
CHANGES WERE INTHE POPULATION.

01:33:14.355 --> 01:33:16.157
AND I THINK PART OF MY QUESTION

01:33:16.223 --> 01:33:17.758
IS HOW ARE YOU RESPONDING TO

01:33:17.825 --> 01:33:20.661
THE CHANGES SO THAT IT IN TERMS

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:23.297
OF OUR FACILITIES THE AND THE

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:25.166
OTHER THING IS THAT THAT SORT

01:33:25.232 --> 01:33:28.436
OF GOT NOTED BUT NOT DIRECTLY-

01:33:28.502 --> 01:33:30.104
WITH THE- THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:33:30.171 --> 01:33:31.973
KEPT IN THE COUNTY JAILS IT

01:33:32.039 --> 01:33:34.408

THE STATE SYSTEM MORE FOR MUCH

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:39.480
MORE SERIOUS OFFENSES. A. N. SO

01:33:39.547 --> 01:33:41.449

THAT JUST HAPPENED IN THE LAST

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.435
DAY OR TWO WHERE. NOTIFICATION

01:34:01.502 --> 01:34:03.070

01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:03.871
DECISIONS UP TO THE

01:34:03.938 --> 01:34:05.539
NOTIFICATION THAT DECIDE WHERE

01:34:05.606 --> 01:34:07.608
AND WHEN BECAUSE- ALMOST EVERY

01:34:07.675 --> 01:34:15.449
SINGLE. ONE IS IN A RURAL AREA

01:34:36.904 --> 01:34:38.172
LEAVE EVERYONE OPEN AT 80%

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:39.607
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT EFFICIENT

01:34:39.673 --> 01:34:40.641
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:42.877

LEVEL HOW DO YOU DECIDE. WHAT

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:58.959
IT IS THAT. AND I KNOW. IT'S

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:00.261
ALSO ABOVE YOUR PAY GRADE

01:35:00.327 --> 01:35:01.062

OF THINGS YOU HAVE TO SHRINK

01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:13.607

OUR PRISONS- THAT'S A GOOD

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:03.383
THING- I DO WANT TO JUST SAY.

01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:04.918
AS IT RELATES BECAUSE WE DIDN'T

01:47:04.985 --> 01:47:08.255

01:47:08.321 --> 01:47:09.890
HARDLY IF ANY EXIT MAKING

01:47:09.956 --> 01:47:11.591
REFERENCE TO THE FACT OF THE-

01:47:11.658 --> 01:47:13.894
PANDEMIC IN THE TRANSFER OF ALL

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:16.997
INMATES. ARM AND IT SEEMED TO

01:47:17.063 --> 01:47:18.365
ME THAT A LOT OF THE REACTION

01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:21.034
AND COMMENT. IN THE BACK UP

01:47:21.101 --> 01:47:22.502
THAT OUR STAFF WORK SO HARD TO

01:47:22.569 --> 01:47:24.704
PREPARE FOR US WAS THAT THIS

01:47:24.771 --> 01:47:26.540
WAS REALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY

01:47:26.606 --> 01:47:28.608
OF THE FEDERAL RECEIVER. I

01:47:28.675 --> 01:47:31.778
HOWEVER I DO HAVE A CONCERN

01:47:31.845 --> 01:47:33.413
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE ACTUAL

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:36.216
TRANSFER WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY

01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:39.686
OF CDCR STAFF. AND THERE SEEM

01:47:39.753 --> 01:47:40.787
TO BE SOME INDICATION THAT

01:47:40.854 --> 01:47:42.722
THERE WERE. INDIVIDUALS AND THE

01:47:42.789 --> 01:47:44.057
PUBLIC HEALTH ARENA THAT HAD

01:47:44.124 --> 01:47:46.059
CONCERNS AND POINTED THIS OUT.

01:47:46.126 --> 01:47:47.794
SO WHILE THE RESPONSIBILITY MAY

01:47:47.861 --> 01:47:49.696
BELONG TO THE FEDERAL RECEIVER

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:53.233
I JUST WANNA MAKE A POINT THAT-

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:55.402
I HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT THAT

01:47:55.468 --> 01:47:57.671
ANSWER TO THE DEGREE THAT. I

01:47:57.737 --> 01:47:59.105
THINK THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP

01:47:59.172 --> 01:48:02.075
AND- THE PRACTICE OF HELL THAT

01:48:02.142 --> 01:48:04.211
TRANSIT THOSE TRANSFERS HAPPEN

01:48:04.277 --> 01:48:05.879
IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CDC

01:48:05.946 --> 01:48:08.248
ARE SO I WILL JUST. LEAVE IT AT

01:48:08.315 --> 01:48:09.816
THAT- YOU MADE A COMMENT WHICH

PRIOR CONVERSATION- WITH CDC

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:28.201
ARE. I HOWEVER THINK SOME OF

01:48:28.268 --> 01:48:29.502

ON ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES

02:38:27.798 --> 02:38:29.299

WASN'T AWARE OF THIS- I WASN'T

02:38:35.205 --> 02:38:35.873
AWARE OF THE FACT THAT

02:38:35.939 --> 02:38:36.974
CONTRACTS THAT ARE MADE WHERE

02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:38.642
PEOPLE MAKE THINGS ARE HAVE YOU

02:38:38.709 --> 02:38:40.644
KNOW- THINGS DONE IN PRISON

02:38:40.711 --> 02:38:42.479
THEY HAVE A LOWER WAGE AND THEN

02:38:42.546 --> 02:38:43.914
WHEN THEY GET OUT. THOSE

02:38:43.981 --> 02:38:45.883
COMPANIES I REFUSE TO HIRE

02:38:45.949 --> 02:38:48.018
INDIVIDUALS I'M I'M A FIRM

02:38:48.085 --> 02:38:50.220
BELIEVER THAT AS IT IS THE

02:38:50.287 --> 02:38:53.624
BEST. SOLUTION FOR RECIDIVISM

02:38:53.690 --> 02:38:56.460
RECIDIVISM AND POVERTY IS A JOB

02:38:56.526 --> 02:38:57.828
AND THAT IF PEOPLE HAVE A JOB

02:38:57.895 --> 02:38:58.896
THAT GIVES THEM A SENSE OF SELF

02:38:58.962 --> 02:39:00.397
WORTH AND ABILITY TO PROVIDE

02:39:00.464 --> 02:39:02.699
FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND SO MY

02:39:02.766 --> 02:39:03.967
QUESTION IS THAT DO YOU HAVE A

02:39:04.034 --> 02:39:05.135
RELATIONSHIP WITH SOME O THOSE

02:39:05.202 --> 02:39:06.136
PEOPLE THAT HAVE THOSE

02:39:06.203 --> 02:39:08.372
CONTRACTS WITH CDC ARE- WELL

02:39:08.438 --> 02:39:09.973
PEOPLE IN PRISON IF YOU DO OR

02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:12.175
YOUR TEAM DOES WHAT'S YOUR

02:39:12.242 --> 02:39:14.311
OUTREACH PLANS SO THAT WHEN

02:39:14.378 --> 02:39:15.412
THESE INDIVIDUALS GET OUT OF

02:39:15.479 --> 02:39:18.348
PRISON. THEY CAN GO APPLY FOR

02:39:18.415 --> 02:39:20.884
THOSE JOBS AND- THE- THE-

02:39:20.951 --> 02:39:22.486
CONTRARY TO MY COLLEAGUE IN LOS

02:39:22.552 --> 02:39:23.987
ANGELES- PURPOSES AS WELL I

02:39:24.054 --> 02:39:25.489
DON'T THINK IN PRISON THEY

02:39:25.555 --> 02:39:27.357
SHOULD MAKE. A TREMENDOUS

02:39:27.424 --> 02:39:28.825
AMOUNT OF MONEY ROOF I MEAN I'M

02:39:28.892 --> 02:39:29.960
YOU KNOW I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR

02:39:30.027 --> 02:39:31.995
THAT. BUT I THINK THAT IF THEY

02:39:32.062 --> 02:39:33.630
GO TO APPLY AFTER THEY GET OUT

02:39:33.697 --> 02:39:34.564
OF PRISON AND THEY'VE ALREADY

02:39:34.631 --> 02:39:36.066
SHOWN THAT THEY CAN DO THE WORK

02:39:36.133 --> 02:39:37.334
THAT THAT SHOULD DEFINITELY BE

02:39:37.401 --> 02:39:38.468
A CONSIDERATION AND SO WHAT'S

02:39:38.535 --> 02:39:39.670
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SOME OF

02:39:39.736 --> 02:39:41.104
THESE CONTRACTORS THAT ACTUALLY

02:39:41.171 --> 02:39:43.273
I DO THIS WORK. AND WHY IS IT

02:39:43.340 --> 02:39:46.276
THAT THEY DO NOT OFFER- THESE-

02:39:46.343 --> 02:39:49.746
EMPLOYEES- JOBS SINCE THEY'VE

02:39:49.813 --> 02:39:50.314

FOLKS AND THAT MANY TIMES- WE

02:40:07.164 --> 02:40:08.966

02:40:09.032 --> 02:40:12.636
FACTORS FOR. LEADING OTHERS

SPACE FOR- AND THAT SPACES JUST

02:50:10.633 --> 02:50:13.636
GENERALLY DICTATED BY. SPACE

THAT COUNTY JAIL. AND THEY HAVE

02:50:43.833 --> 02:50:45.969
FAR FEWER FACILITIES AND FAR

02:50:46.035 --> 02:50:49.305
FEWER. ARE FAR LESS SPACE. THAN

CARE PARTNERS- ON OUR ON OUR

02:51:31.114 --> 02:51:32.682
MOVIE MATRIX SO THAT WE CAN GET

02:51:32.749 --> 02:51:34.317
THE NECESSARY INTERNAL MOVEMENT

02:51:34.384 --> 02:51:36.452

FUTURE PANDEMIC RESPONSES SO

02:51:42.291 --> 02:51:42.859
THAT THE COUNTIES AREN'T

02:51:42.925 --> 02:51:45.895
ABSORBING- AGAIN IN IN LESS

02:51:45.962 --> 02:51:47.930
SPACE AND LESS ADEQUATE

02:51:47.997 --> 02:51:49.699
FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY ARE A

02:51:49.766 --> 02:51:52.068
COUNTY JAIL NOT A FULL PRISON

02:51:52.135 --> 02:51:56.706
SYSTEM- IS FUTURE PANDEMICS OUR

02:51:56.773 --> 02:51:58.508
FUTURE ISSUES THAT WE MAY FACE-

02:51:58.574 --> 02:51:59.842
I MEAN IT'S GREAT THAT YOU GUYS

02:51:59.909 --> 02:52:00.843
JUST HAVE THE ABILITY SAY NO

02:52:00.910 --> 02:52:02.011
WE'RE NOT TAKING THEM. BUT

02:52:02.078 --> 02:52:03.579
THEY'RE STILL GETTING THEM SO

02:52:03.646 --> 02:52:06.182
AND DO YOU HAVE A PLAN THAT TO

02:52:06.249 --> 02:52:09.285
NOT LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN OR IS

02:52:09.352 --> 02:52:13.089
THAT PART OF YOUR PLAN. THANK

02:52:13.156 --> 02:52:15.658
YOU SENATOR- I THINK WE'VE ALL

02:52:15.725 --> 02:52:16.859
LEARNED A LOT WE'RE STILL

02:52:16.926 --> 02:52:18.594
LEARNING FROM WHAT WE'VE GONE

02:52:18.661 --> 02:52:20.596
THROUGH WITH THE PANDEMIC OVER

02:52:20.663 --> 02:52:23.266
THE PAST YEAR- I THINK WE CAN

02:52:23.332 --> 02:52:25.001
TAKE WHAT WE LEARNED AND

02:52:25.068 --> 02:52:26.402
PROBABLY BE MORE EFFICIENT

02:52:26.469 --> 02:52:29.338
GOING FORWARD- WHAT ANOTHER.

02:52:29.405 --> 02:52:30.740
POTENTIAL PANDEMIC COULD BRING

02:52:30.807 --> 02:52:33.543
TO US- IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY

02:52:33.609 --> 02:52:35.144
WHAT THE FUTURE MIGHT HOLD.

02:52:35.211 --> 02:52:39.082
GIVEN WHAT THAT MIGHT BE- BUT I

02:52:39.148 --> 02:52:40.416

02:52:43.319 --> 02:52:46.089
SITUATION. AND I THINK WE'RE I

OPERATIONALLY- SO I DEFINITELY

02:52:50.426 --> 02:52:51.594
THINK IT WILL HELP US IF WE'RE

02:52:51.661 --> 02:52:54.597

WATER- IS BEING- SHIPPED IN.

02:54:45.274 --> 02:54:46.876

02:57:33.409 --> 02:57:35.378
ADDITIONAL LET CHLORINE LEVELS

02:57:35.444 --> 02:57:37.146
TO THE SAME LEVELS A YEAR AGO

02:57:37.213 --> 02:57:38.481
BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO SEASONAL

02:57:38.547 --> 02:57:39.949
DIFFERENCES AS FAR AS WHEN

02:57:40.016 --> 02:57:41.417
LEGIONELLA MIGHT BE MORE-

02:57:41.484 --> 02:57:42.685
PRESENT ONE MIGHT BE MORE

02:57:42.752 --> 02:57:43.686
LIKELY TO PROPAGATE IN THE

02:57:43.753 --> 02:57:45.855
SYSTEMS. SO THOSE ARE ARE ARE

02:57:45.921 --> 02:57:48.190
ARE THE METHODS WERE DRESSING

02:57:48.257 --> 02:57:50.459
DOWN IT- STOCKED IN- ELSEWHERE

02:57:50.526 --> 02:57:50.993
IN THE SYSTEM A COUPLE OF

02:57:51.060 --> 02:57:52.661
THINGS I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT-

02:57:52.728 --> 02:57:54.730
WE HAVE RECEIVED- INCREASED-

02:57:54.797 --> 02:57:57.299
MAINTENANCE FUNDING BOTH- ONE

02:57:57.366 --> 02:57:58.167
TIME DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

02:57:58.234 --> 02:58:00.302
FUNDING. AND ALSO ONGOING

02:58:00.369 --> 02:58:01.370
ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FUNDING OVER

02:58:01.437 --> 02:58:03.072
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT IS

02:58:03.139 --> 02:58:05.775
pESPECIALLY ON CRITICAL ITEMS

02:58:05.841 --> 02:58:07.476
SUCH AS WATER. AND DRINKING

02:58:07.543 --> 02:58:09.145
WATER SYSTEMS WE ARE NOT

02:58:09.211 --> 02:58:10.846
LETTING MAINTENANCE OR REPAIRS

02:58:10.913 --> 02:58:12.681
LAG ON THOSE BUT MAKING SURE WE

02:58:12.748 --> 02:58:14.717
PRIORITIZE THOSE. ONE LAST

02:58:14.784 --> 02:58:16.419
THING I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE IS

02:58:16.485 --> 02:58:18.187
WE ABOUT ONE THIRD OF OUR-

02:58:18.254 --> 02:58:19.889
PRISONS OPERATE OFF OF THE

02:58:19.955 --> 02:58:21.524
MUNICIPAL WATER SYSTEM AND THAT

02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:22.758
WAS A SIMILAR SITUATION THERE

02:58:22.825 --> 02:58:26.195
AT STOCKTON- WE- HAVE IN. DONNA

02:58:26.262 --> 02:58:28.364
AUDIT OF THOSE PRISONS. SINCE

02:58:28.431 --> 02:58:30.232
OUR EXPERIENCES OF STOCKTON IN

02:58:30.299 --> 02:58:31.400
ORDER TO IMPLEMENT BEST

02:58:31.467 --> 02:58:32.935
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AT THOSE

02:58:33.002 --> 02:58:34.503
LOCATIONS MAKE SURE THE REGULAR

02:58:34.570 --> 02:58:36.972
TESTING OF CHLORINE LEVELS.

02:58:37.039 --> 02:58:39.442
AND- OTHER- BEST MANAGEMENT

02:58:39.508 --> 02:58:42.011
PRACTICES ARE IN PLACE IN ORDER

02:58:42.078 --> 02:58:43.479
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GOING

02:58:43.546 --> 02:58:45.114
TO AVOID HAVING LEGIONELLA OR

02:58:45.181 --> 02:58:46.949
OTHER WATERBORNE INSTANCES OF

02:58:47.016 --> 02:58:48.951
THOSE LOCATIONS. THE OTHER TWO

02:58:49.018 --> 02:58:51.020
THIRDS OF OUR PRISONS HAVE-

02:58:51.087 --> 02:58:52.621
OPERATING OPERATE A WATER PLANT

02:58:52.688 --> 02:58:53.923
THAT'S ALREADY LICENSED BY THE

02:58:53.989 --> 02:58:55.758
DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER. AND

02:58:55.825 --> 02:58:57.593
WE FEEL- BETTER AT THOSE

02:58:57.660 --> 02:58:59.061
LOCATIONS BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'RE

02:58:59.128 --> 02:59:00.663
ALREADY TESTING AND SENDING IN

02:59:00.729 --> 02:59:02.331
REGULAR REPORTS. TO THE A

02:59:02.398 --> 02:59:07.436
DIVISION OF. DRINKING WATER AT

02:59:07.503 --> 02:59:08.337
AT THOSE LOCATIONS. SO MY

02:59:08.404 --> 02:59:09.171
ASSUMPTION IS THAT AND CORRECT

02:59:09.238 --> 02:59:10.039
ME IF I'M WRONG THAT THE

02:59:10.106 --> 02:59:12.475
WARDENS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:59:12.541 --> 02:59:15.311
THE- THE MAINTENANCE OF THEIR-

02:59:15.377 --> 02:59:16.545
FACILITIES MAKING SURE THAT

02:59:16.612 --> 02:59:18.681
THINGS ARE CLEAN AND SAFE- BUT

02:59:18.747 --> 02:59:20.082
THAT. YOUR DIVISION IS

02:59:20.149 --> 02:59:22.151
RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THEM

02:59:22.218 --> 02:59:23.853

THIS IN OUR DISCUSSION- I

02:59:37.800 --> 02:59:40.202
RECEIVED PHOTOS OF CONDITIONS

02:59:40.269 --> 02:59:43.139
INSIDE- THE PRISONS. DURING

COBIT AND- DEBTS IMAGES WERE AS

02:59:47.143 --> 02:59:50.146
SHOCKING AND- TO SAY THE LEAST.

02:59:50.212 --> 02:59:53.182
BUT IT LOOKED LIKE A TORNADO

02:59:53.249 --> 02:59:55.851
HAD HIT- INSIDE THE FACILITY

02:59:55.918 --> 02:59:57.786
AND SO JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW HOW

02:59:57.853 --> 03:00:00.623
THAT KIND OF MONITORING.

03:00:00.689 --> 03:00:06.061
HAPPENS. THANK YOU SENATOR- WE

WORK PLAN WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY

03:00:32.054 --> 03:00:34.523
A SPENDING BUDGET. SO THIS IS

03:00:34.590 --> 03:00:35.224
HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'RE

03:00:35.291 --> 03:00:37.393

SUPPRESSION SERVICING THINGS

LIKE THAT. SO THOSE ARE A

03:00:50.439 --> 03:00:51.674
COUPLE OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN

NEEDS A LARGE SCALE DEFERRED

03:01:07.590 --> 03:01:08.724
MAINTENANCE MEANS THAT- WE DID

03:01:08.791 --> 03:01:10.426
NOT PREVIOUSLY KNOW ABOUT. OR

03:01:10.492 --> 03:01:11.460
THAT THE PERSON HAD NOT TOLD US

03:01:11.527 --> 03:01:12.828

BEING SPENT THROUGHOUT THE

03:01:34.617 --> 03:01:36.218
YEAR. AND SO WE SEE THAT-

03:01:36.285 --> 03:01:38.287
PRISON AS A HALFWAY THROUGH THE

03:01:38.354 --> 03:01:39.655

03:02:23.599 --> 03:02:26.201
BELIEVE THAT- GRANTING FOLKS

03:02:26.268 --> 03:02:27.670
RELEASE AND HAVING FOLKS ON

03:02:27.736 --> 03:02:30.139
PAROLE WITHOUT HOUSING- IS A

03:02:30.205 --> 03:02:32.274

MEETING THEM WHERE THEY ARE IS

03:04:58.887 --> 03:04:59.555
ONE THING MAKING SURE THEY

03:04:59.621 --> 03:05:00.823
DON'T COME BACK INTO THE SYSTEM

03:05:00.889 --> 03:05:02.858
IS THE THING THAT I'M MOST.

CONCERNED ABOUT SO MY HOPE IS

03:05:05.027 --> 03:05:07.596
THAT THERE'S A MORE LASER FOCUS

03:05:07.663 --> 03:05:09.331
ON MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS HAVE

03:05:09.398 --> 03:05:11.133
THE SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED. SO

03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:13.702
THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING THEM BACK

03:05:13.769 --> 03:05:14.236

QUESTION ABOUT- INTAKE BEING

03:05:30.118 --> 03:05:33.255
CAUSED BECAUSE OF COVE IT- SO

03:05:33.322 --> 03:05:34.523
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWO THINGS

03:05:34.590 --> 03:05:35.991
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT

03:05:36.058 --> 03:05:38.427
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FIRE CAMPS

03:05:38.494 --> 03:05:45.167
AT C. I. W. BUT SINCE- WE'VE

03:05:45.234 --> 03:05:46.602
TALKED A LOT ABOUT IT I JUST

03:05:46.668 --> 03:05:47.769
WANT TO SHARE THAT I HAVE HEARD

03:05:47.836 --> 03:05:49.771
IN. A NUMBER OF INSTANCES

03:05:49.838 --> 03:05:55.944
WHERE- WOMEN AT C. I. W. ARM

03:05:56.011 --> 03:05:57.045

03:05:57.112 --> 03:05:59.014
COMING FROM FOLKS WHO ARE OUT-

03:05:59.081 --> 03:05:59.915
SO NOT JUST FROM FOLKS WHO ARE

03:05:59.982 --> 03:06:02.751
IN FACT. HAVE TALKED ABOUT-

03:06:02.818 --> 03:06:05.954
INSTANCES WHERE- BEING ACCEPTED

03:06:06.021 --> 03:06:07.990

PROGRAM THE- THE FIRE CAN'T

03:06:11.426 --> 03:06:13.128
PROGRAM WAS PREDICATED ON

03:06:13.195 --> 03:06:15.864
SEXUAL FAVORS- AND SO I'M JUST

03:06:15.931 --> 03:06:17.733
RAISING THAT BECAUSE I AM

03:06:17.799 --> 03:06:19.902
ACUTELY CONCERNED ABOUT ARE

03:06:19.968 --> 03:06:23.305
WOMEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED-

03:06:23.372 --> 03:06:27.276
AND- YOU KNOW. THE THESE ARE IN.

03:06:27.342 --> 03:06:30.946
CHOICE PROGRAMS I RECOGNIZE IN

03:06:31.013 --> 03:06:32.014
THERE ONE THAT FOLKS REALLY

03:06:32.080 --> 03:06:36.218
WANT TO BE PART OF- AND SO-

03:06:36.285 --> 03:06:38.487
SEXUALIZING ARE ARE

03:06:38.554 --> 03:06:40.556
INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS- AND

03:06:40.622 --> 03:06:42.658
BAITING THEM WITH THESE KINDS

03:06:42.724 --> 03:06:44.560
OF PROGRAMS I'M IS NOT

03:06:44.626 --> 03:06:45.327
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

03:06:45.394 --> 03:06:47.296
TOLERATE SO IT'S DID THAT HAVE

03:06:47.362 --> 03:06:48.730
ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU BY FIRE

03:06:48.797 --> 03:06:49.898
CAMPS WAS IN YOUR LITTLE PACKET

03:06:49.965 --> 03:06:51.833
AND I FELT LIKE I HAD TO JUST

03:06:51.900 --> 03:06:54.469
SAY TO PUT IT ON THE RECORD-

03:06:54.536 --> 03:06:59.141
BUT- I DID ASK ABOUT. YOU KNOW

03:06:59.207 --> 03:07:04.112
ARMED COMPASS- AND THAT- AND

03:07:04.179 --> 03:07:05.480
HOW DURING THE RECEPTION CENTER

03:07:05.547 --> 03:07:07.416
PROCESSING IT IS USED TO HELP

03:07:07.482 --> 03:07:08.617
CREATE A REHABILITATION CASE

03:07:08.684 --> 03:07:11.453
PLAN AND ALSO- STUDIES HAVE

03:07:11.520 --> 03:07:13.722
COME OUT THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT-

03:07:13.789 --> 03:07:16.425
IT IS IT IT USES AN ALGORITHM

03:07:16.491 --> 03:07:20.128
THAT'S RACIALLY BIASED AND SO-

03:07:20.195 --> 03:07:23.532
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HEAR YOU-

03:07:23.599 --> 03:07:26.635
TALK TO ME ABOUT COMPASS AND-

03:07:26.702 --> 03:07:29.571
STEPS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS-

03:07:29.638 --> 03:07:30.706
TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT

03:07:30.772 --> 03:07:33.742
THE SOLE- DETERMINANT TOOL THAT

03:07:33.809 --> 03:07:34.977
WERE USING WHEN WE'RE TRYING

03:07:35.043 --> 03:07:37.112
TO- WHEN WE'RE HAVING FOLKS

03:07:37.179 --> 03:07:38.680

03:07:39.681 --> 03:07:41.249
TAKEN OVER TRYING TO PUT

03:07:41.316 --> 03:07:42.451
TOGETHER A REHABILITATION PLAN

03:07:42.517 --> 03:07:43.952
FOR THEM. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

03:07:44.019 --> 03:07:45.921
HOW WE CAN PUT A PLAN OF

03:07:45.988 --> 03:07:48.590
SUCCESS TOGETHER FOR SOMEONE

03:07:48.657 --> 03:07:53.562
USING A TOOL- THAT- SET THEM

03:07:53.629 --> 03:08:00.535
BACK. THANK YOU SENATOR- I HAVE

03:08:00.602 --> 03:08:03.972
NOT HEARD THAT YEAH THAT.

03:08:04.039 --> 03:08:05.941
COMPLAINT AGAINST CONGRESS-

03:08:06.008 --> 03:08:07.175
UNTIL GOING THROUGH THIS

03:08:07.242 --> 03:08:08.310
PROCESS AND DO A LITTLE

03:08:08.377 --> 03:08:10.712
RESEARCH MYSELF AND THEN READ

03:08:10.779 --> 03:08:12.781
READ SOME SOME ARTICLES WERE

03:08:12.848 --> 03:08:15.917
TALKED ABOUT CAMPUS- BEING USED

03:08:15.984 --> 03:08:18.820
FOR SENTENCING- AND THE RACIAL

03:08:18.887 --> 03:08:21.790
BIAS TOWARDS SENTENCING- I

03:08:21.857 --> 03:08:23.625
COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING.

03:08:23.692 --> 03:08:25.594
DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR

03:08:25.661 --> 03:08:28.163
PROCESS- I BELIEVE THE

03:08:28.230 --> 03:08:30.532
SECRETARY MENTIONS THAT THAT WE

03:08:30.599 --> 03:08:32.567

ASSESSMENT TOOLS- I DON'T KNOW

03:08:35.437 --> 03:08:36.371
WHERE THAT PROCESS IS RIGHT

03:08:36.438 --> 03:08:39.074
NOW- BUT I BELIEVE THAT IS

03:08:39.141 --> 03:08:40.042
SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT IS

03:08:40.108 --> 03:08:42.044
DOING RIGHT NOW IS LOOKING AT

03:08:42.110 --> 03:08:44.413
OTHER THINGS- BUT I CAN ALSO

03:08:44.479 --> 03:08:45.013
TELL YOU THAT THAT'S NOT THE

03:08:45.080 --> 03:08:48.216
ONLY. THE ONLY A STEP IS TAKEN

03:08:48.283 --> 03:08:50.152
TO TRY AND BUILD THAT PLAN FOR

03:08:50.218 --> 03:08:52.954
SUBSTANCE USE- THAT'S HANDLED

03:08:53.021 --> 03:08:53.855
THROUGH OUR HEALTH CARE

03:08:53.922 --> 03:08:56.491
DEPARTMENT- AND BETWEEN A

03:08:56.558 --> 03:08:59.161
COMBINATION OF NURSING AND

03:08:59.227 --> 03:09:03.465
SOCIAL WORKERS THEIR INTERVIEWS

03:09:03.532 --> 03:09:04.900
DONE TO ASSESS- TO. THEIR SENSE

03:09:04.966 --> 03:09:06.101
USE NAY SO THAT'S PART OF THAT

03:09:06.168 --> 03:09:08.270
PLAN- THERE ARE INTERVIEWS

03:09:08.336 --> 03:09:09.938
DIRECTLY WITH THE CORRECTIONAL

03:09:10.005 --> 03:09:14.076

03:09:28.724 --> 03:09:30.058
THE ONLY THING THAT SHOES BUT

03:09:30.125 --> 03:09:31.626

03:09:31.693 --> 03:09:33.762
THE SECRETARY MENTIONED I

03:09:33.829 --> 03:09:34.296
BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT IS

03:09:34.362 --> 03:09:35.864
LOOKING AT OTHER. AND ANOTHER

03:09:35.931 --> 03:09:38.366
TOOL FOR THAT I DON'T I DON'T

03:09:38.433 --> 03:09:39.000

03:09:39.067 --> 03:09:40.802
NOW BUT- WELL HOPEFULLY THAT'S

03:09:40.869 --> 03:09:42.771
FAST TRACKED. I DO WANT TO SAY

NUMBER OF FOLKS TELL ME THAT

SOMETIMES THEY TELL THE JUDGE

03:09:49.644 --> 03:09:51.813
JUST SEND ME TO PRISON. BECAUSE

03:09:51.880 --> 03:09:53.949
THE PROGRAMMING AND OUR STATE

03:09:54.015 --> 03:09:55.917
CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. IS

03:09:55.984 --> 03:09:58.186
MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT WE GET-

AT OUR COUNTY JAIL FACILITIES.

03:10:00.222 --> 03:10:02.457
