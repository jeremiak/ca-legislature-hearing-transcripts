THEY TURNED IT OFF AND THEN YOU TURN THE. THEY HAVE. I THINK WHEN WE LAST CONVENE WE WERE DEALING WITH THE OF IN PERSON- AND I JUST WANT TO AMPLE. THAT FITS TO ME WE DON'T TAKE HUGE STEP BACKWARDS IN THE GOVERNOR PANDA THAT CREDIT THAT ARE SO. ARE IN PERSON JUST ONCE. TO EVERYONE WHO WANTS IT. HOWEVER ELEAZAR ALSO. NEED TO BE ABLE TO. THE OPTION OF IN DISTANCE. TO ANYONE WHO IT BECAUSE- THE REALITY IS ARE MANY PARENTS THAT IF TO ME THAT ARE ON. WITH IN PERSONS AND GIVEN THE NEEDS. OF OUR TIME I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE OFFER THAT OPTIONS. PARENTS ALSO BROUGHT IT TO ME CONCERNS ABOUT INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES THE NUMBER OF- MINUTES THAT TEACHERS ACTUALLY PROVIDED FOR CONSTRUCTION PER DAY. I'VE HEARD REPORTS THAT SOME ELEAZAR OFFERED AS FEW AS A HUNDRED TWENTY MINUTES OF INSTRUCTION PER DAY- SO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT IN THE COMING FALL AS WELL. I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE A CONGRESS AND PRESIDENT THAT ARE WILLING TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. THE RESUMPTION IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. WITH A- BOUNTY OF- THE- IN FINDING AND- I HOPE THAT WILL USE THOSE FUNDS TO HELP ADDRESS NOT ONLY LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION MENTAL HEALTH WHICH ARE GONNA BE SO CRITICAL- BUT ALSO JUST MAKING SURE. THAT WE ADDRESS THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES WE FACE THAT WE OFFER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION EVERYONE WHO WANTS IT- BUT THEY WE MAINTAIN SOME FLEXIBILITY- GIVEN THAT SOME PARENTS ARE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS MAY BE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH GOING BACK TO SCHOOL. THANK YOU CARE. THANK YOU SENATOR AND SINCE YOU RAISED THE SUBJECT. OF WE WILL BE AT SOME POINT CONSIDERING THE TOPIC THAT YOU JUST RAISED ITS NOT AT THIS HEARING. BOB LET ME JUST SUBSCRIBED TO YOUR COMMENTS AND I THINK THAT. THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT WE WANT TO OFFER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WANT MAKE SURE. THEY'RE I THINK ONE OF THE- THE CONTROLLING FACTORS. IS THAT. ONCE WE COME OUT THE BAND. IT IS LIKE THAT WE WILL REACH TO. L. A. ON ENROLLMENT. AND WE DON'T WANT TO DO ANY. THAT FOR CHALLENGE AD NOT OFF FLOOD. FOR THE PARA THAT NOT. TO HAVE THEIR TO COME BACK IN PERSON RIGHT AWAY. IS AN ENROLLMENT ISSUE AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE AND- THE OTHER THING IS WE'RE HEARING LOUDLY AND CLEARLY. I THINK FROM THE PARENTS THAT REALLY WANT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND DON'T WANT ANY OPTION. AND I THINK WE ARE REALLY SYMPATHETIC WE WANT TO MAKE IN PERSON OPTION. THE DEFAULT BUT- YOUR NEW WANTS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE TO KNOW AND I THINK WE WILL BE CONSIDERING THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. FOLLOW WITH THAT- AND SENT OR BOGUS THIS ONE OF THREE OF AND SHE IS FREE SO I THE HOME SO. WITH THE WE MOVE ITEM NUMBER ONE WHICH IS SCHOOL IN THE PRIORITY AND POP.

GOOD MORNING SIR TENS OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WAS ASKED TODAY TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE STATE SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAM DISCUSSED SOME OF THE MORE RECENT FEDERAL AND STATE CHANGES TO THE SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS YOU TO PANDEMIC. UNDESCRIBED THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS PROPOSAL. THE SCHOOLS SHOULD ALSO BIPARTISAN IN THIS OR FEDERAL OR STATE INTEREST PROGRAM. THERE SO- MIL PROGRESS AS A IN YOUR- BUT GENERALLY HAVE TO CERTAIN NUTRITION. AND THE STAY IN FRONT GOVERNMENT REIMBURSED DISTRICTS FOR THE MILL THEY SERVE TO STUDENTS. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY. THE THAT PURCHASE IN THE NOW SCHOOL IN PROGRAM GENERALLY. THREE DOLLARS SIXTY PER LUNCH AND THREE DOLLARS IN THIRTEEN PER LIKE. THE STATE PROGRAM PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TWENTY FOUR CENTS PER FOR OR- PRICE FOR THE. BUT GREEN REDUCE PRICE MAY- GENERALLY STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR FREE IF FAMILY CAN INCOME- IS OUR HIGH AND 30% THE FIVE FEDERAL LEVEL WHICH IS ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS FOR OF TWO AND THE REDUCE PRICING JIM IS HUNDRED FIVE PER OF THE COST LEVEL WHICH ABOUT. FORTY THOUSAND FOR THREE. I'M INTERESTED PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. SOME OF THESE PROGRAM CHANGES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS CAN IT HERE TO OUR CORPORATE SAFETY MATTERS WORK TO SUPPORT ACCESS TO MILLS DURING SCHOOL CLOSURES. FOR EXAMPLE YOU STA ALLOWS MILLS TO BE SERVED IN NAM CONGREGATE SETTINGS AND PICKED UP. BY THE PARENT OF ELIGIBLE CHILDREN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. MILLS ARE REQUIRED TO BE CERTAIN CONGREGATE SETTINGS HAYMAN'S. GIN BY PARTICIPANTS ON SITE. WHEN WE WERE IN LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE SEE ACTION. BY YOU WOULD STILL TO ALLOW SCHOOL TO OFFER A SEAMLESS SUMMER OFF DURING. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR AND MAKING THIS OPTION AVAILABLE TO ALL SCHOOL STUDENT ORTIZ THIS OPTION IS TYPICALLY ONLY AVAILABLE DURING SCHOOL VACATION PERIODS SUCH AS DURING SUMMER. AND TOO LOW INCOME AREAS. THIS OPTION MUCH PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY. TO THE TYPICAL PROGRAM RULES. FOR EXAMPLE OFFERING THE SEAMLESS SUMMER OPTION ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR SCHOOLS TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY. AND COLLECTING. TOOLS HOWEVER MOST OFTEN JOB OFFERING THIS PROGRAM. THE GOVERNMENT AND ALSO PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FISCAL SUPPORT TO SUPPORT SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS WITH THE MAKES THE PROPOSITION NINETY AND FEDERAL FUNDS THE STATE PROVIDED A HUNDRED NINETY TWO MILLION TO PROVIDE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FIVE CENTS PER MEAL SERVER BETWEEN. MARCH AND AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALSO PROVIDED FUNDING TO HELP ADDRESS MIDDLE- WATCHING A REIMBURSEMENT. FROM MARCH TO JUNE TWENTY TWENTY. AFTER THEY BRIEFLY JUST. THE SENATE DEMOCRATS CAUCUS. I'M PAGE SIX OF YOUR TO AS PROPOSAL. THE DEMOCRATS PROPOSE MAKING PROGRESS IN A NUMBER OF PRIORITY AREAS AND THESE INCLUDE PROVIDING UNIVERSAL MALES WHICH FOR FACILITIES TO ALL STUDENTS. CONTINUING TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL EMAIL REIMBURSEMENTS AND BUILD OFF THE LEAPERS CREEK IN AUTHORIZED. BY THE USDA. BRITISH TELECOM DURING SCHOOL BREAKS IN SUMMER BREAKS REDUCE OR ELIMINATE SCHOOL MIL- MILTON LEDS INCREASINGLY ATTRITIONAL CONTENT MILLS AN INCREASE LOCALLY GROWN FOODS INSTALLATIONS. AND TO STABILIZE A SUPPORTER AND SUPPORT THE CLASSIFIED STAFF TO PROVIDE FOOD SERVICE AT SCHOOLS THIS COULD INCLUDE MY REMARKS IN ANY HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS WILL MOVE TO PHILLY. GARDNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING. THE MORNING ELLIE GARNER ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND THE S. S. P. I. AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PROBABLY SUPPORT YEAR ROUND ACCESS TO HEALTHY AND NUTRITIOUS MEALS. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION ADMINISTERS THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. AND LOCAL AGENCY PROGRAM PROVIDERS THAT OPERATE SEVEN USDA FEDERAL CHILD NUTRITION MEAL PROGRAMS THE MEAL PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO COLLECT PER YOUR ROUND ACTS TO HEALTH MEALS BY. DURING AND SCHOOL WHEN SCHOOL'S NOT IN SESSION AND FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN DAY CARE PROVIDING MORE THAN ONE BILLION MEALS AND SNACKS TO ARE MOST AT RISK AND SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN. EXISTING FEDERAL UNIVERSAL MEAL OPTIONS SUCH AS COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY AND PROVISION TO HELP BREAK DOWN YOUR PARTICIPATION BARRIERS. A pALLOWS SCHOOLS IN HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES WITH AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT PERCENTAGE AT 40% OR MORE TO OFFER TWO MEALS EACH SCHOOL DAY. FREE OF CHARGE TO ALL STUDENTS BASED ON THE SCHOOLS I S. P. FORMULA THE SCHOOLS RECEIVE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR MEALS SERVED AT EITHER THE FREE OR PAID RATES. FEDERAL REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT DIFFERENCES IN MALE ME IN MEAL REIMBURSEMENT AND THE COST OF PROVIDING ALL MEALS FOR FREE THE MADE UP WITH NON FEDERAL SIGNS. NO MEAL APPLICATIONS ARE REQUIRED. PROVISION TO ALLOW SCHOOLS TO SERVE MEALS AT NO CHARGE BUT SIMPLIFIES ME ACCOUNTING AND CLEANING PROCEDURES BY ALLOWING THE SCHOOL TO RECEIVE MEAL REIMBURSEMENTS BASED ON CLEANING PERCENTAGES THAT IS ESTABLISHED EVERY FOUR YEARS. HE SAID HE'S CONFIRMED THAT THERE IS AN INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN THE SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAM. FOR ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS WHEN ALL KIDS EAT FOR FREE. WELL NURSING STUDENTS ARE BETTER ABLE TO REACH THEIR FULL ACADEMIC POTENTIAL AND HAVE GREATER HEALTH OUTCOMES THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE. SO LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FEDERAL NUTRITION MEAL WAIVERS. AS OUR NATION AND STATE BEGIN TO RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC THAT COULD BE NINETEEN CHILD NUTRITION MEAL WAIVERS AUTHORIZED AUST AUTHORIZED BY THE USDA WILL HELP ENSURE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN CONTINUE TO HAVE EASY ACCESS THIS SUMMER ANDFOR THE ENTIRE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR HEALTHY MEALS AND- SNACKS. OFFERED BY THE SCHOOLS PARTICIPATING IN THE FEDERAL NUTRITION PROGRAMS. THIS MEANS THAT THERE IS NO AREA ELIGIBILITY LIMITATION NO NEED TO COLLECT MEAL APPLICATIONS ALL MEALS ARE SERVED AT A FREE RATE SO THERE IS NO MEAL DEBT INCURRED BY THE L. EA. AND THIS CAN THIS IS ALLOWS FOR CONTINUATION OF NON CONGREGATE SERVICES SUCH AS GRAB AND GO AND CURBSIDE PICKUP MEALS. UNDER THE FEDERAL WAIVERS FOR THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR SCHOOLS THAT ARE THAT ARE APPROVED TO OPERATE THAT SEAMLESS SUMMER OPTION THAT SERRA. REFERRED TO YOU CAN SERVE ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF INCOME LOCATION LEARNING MODALITY OR SITE TYPE. USDA IS ALSO PROVIDING A HIGHER MEAL REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR MEALS SERVED THREE THAT SSL. THESE WAIVERS BRING OUR STATE CLOSER TO OUR VISION OF UNIVERSAL MEALS FOR ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF INCOME OR IS IT OUT. WHAT'S ABOUT THAT UNIVERSAL MEALS ONCE THE FEDERAL WAIVERS EXPIRES. AS WE DISCUSSED A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION FOR UNIVERSAL MEALS IN CALIFORNIA IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ARE UNIVERSAL MEALS PROGRAM BE FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE AND THAT WE MAXIMIZE ALL FEDERAL MEAL REIMBURSEMENT OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE SUPPLEMENTING WITH ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDS. THE CITY HAS THREE RECOMMENDATIONS TO GUIDE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE REQUIRE ALL SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FEDERAL SCHOOL NUTRITION MEAL PROGRAM IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE STATE UNIVERSAL MEAL REIMBURSEMENT SUPPLEMENTS. WITHOUT FULL FULL PARTICIPATION CALIFORNIA'S FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AND THAT REDUCTION WOULD NEED TO BE BACK FILLED BY STATE GENERAL FUNDS. PERSPECTIVE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE CALIFORNIA FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS WAS TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. WE NEED TO MAXIMIZE THE ONGOING FEDERAL FUNDING AND DESIGN THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSAL MEAL PROGRAM TO SUPPLEMENT NOT SUPPLANT THE FEDERAL MEAL PROGRAMS. BY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL STUDENTS TO RECEIVE UP TO TWO FREE MEALS EACH DAY REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME ELIGIBILITY THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSAL MEAL PROGRAM WE NEED TO PROVIDE ONGOING STATE REIMBURSEMENT FOR MEALS SERVED TO CHILDREN WHO DO NOT MEET THE FEDERAL INCOME OR ELIGIBILITY STATUS FOR FREE OR REDUCED MEALS. FROM THE HEALTH CLAIMS AT THE FEDERAL FREE RATE NO ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDS WILL BE NEEDED AS IT'S PAID A 100% I FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT. MEALS CLEANED AT THE FEDERAL REDUCED PRICE RATE IN PAID RATES WOULD BE NEED TO BE SUPPLEMENTED BY STATE FUNDS SO THE ALLEY A CAN PROVIDE. MEALS FREE TO ALL STUDENTS EVEN WHEN STUDENTS MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR FREE. WE REALIZE THAT NOT ALL SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH FOR SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM. ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO CHARTERS DO NOT PARTICIPATE CURRENTLY. MANY TIMES THIS IS BECAUSE THE SCHOOL IS LOCATED IN COMMUNITIES WITH A VERY LOW POPULATION OF FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEAL ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSAL MEALS PROGRAM MAY HELP TO INCENTIVIZE ALL SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FEDERAL MEAL PROGRAMS. SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT ON THE FEDERAL MEAL PROGRAMS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE FEDERAL MEAL MEAL REIMBURSEMENT. BUT THEY MUST STILL PROVIDE ONE NUTRITIONALLY ADEQUATE MEAL TO ALL NEEDY STUDENTS. WITH THE STATE'S MEAL REIMBURSEMENT IS ONLY TWENTY FOUR CENTS PER MEAL WELL THE FEDERAL MERE MEAL REIMBURSEMENT AT. AT THE FREE RATE FOR LUNCH IS UP TO THREE DOLLARS AND SIXTY CENTS PER LUNCH SERVICE. OUR SECOND RECOMMENDED. IS TO SUPPORT ACCESS TO HEALTHIER MEALS WHEN SCHOOL IS NOT IN SESSION IN THREE SPECIFIC WAYS. ONE OFFERING ADDITIONAL STATE MEAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR AT LEAST OPERATE THE SEAMLESS SUMMER OPTION DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS IS A HEALTHY MEAL STANDARD ADMINISTRATIVE AT THE END IS ADMINISTRATIVELY LESS BURDENSOME FOR SCHOOLS. THE SECOND WAY IS A LEADING FINANCIAL LOSSES TO SCHOOL SUMMER FOOD SERVICE OPERATIONS THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSAL MEAL PROGRAM COULD SUPPLEMENT THE FEDERAL SEAMLESS SUMMER OPTION MEAL REIMBURSEMENT RATE TO MATCH THE HIGHER SUMMER FOOD SERVICE PROGRAM FEDERAL RATES. AND THIRD ENSURING THAT THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSAL MEAL PROGRAM DESIGN DOES NOT HAVE UNINTENDED QUESTION AT AN INTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN ELIMINATING SUMMER FOOD SERVICE WORKER JOBS. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MENTION THE POTENTIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT OF SCHOOL FOOD SERVICE WORKERS WHO ARE TYPICALLY THE LOWEST EARNING POSITIONS IN A SCHOOL. IN MANY CASES THESE POSITIONS ARE FILLED BY WOMEN OF COLOR AND THEY ARE NOT FULL TIME GOOD SERVICE WORKERS DEPEND ON WORKING THE SUMMER MONTHS AND SOMETIMES YEAR ROUND. WE MUST ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT CREATING A PROGRAM THAT WOULD RESULT IN FOOD SERVICE STAFF LAYOFFS IN THE SUMMER MONTHS BECAUSE OF A LOWER PARTICIPATION ELECTRONIC BENEFIT CARDS ARE USED IN LIEU OF SERVING MEALS. OUR THIRD AND FINAL RECOMMENDATION IS TO INCENTIVIZE YEAR ROUND ACCESS TO MEALS BY INCREASING FUNDING FOR LOCAL ASSISTANT GRANTS. ASSISTANCE GRANTS TO ELEAZAR. THIS CAN BUILD THEIR MEAL PROGRAMS AND IN HALF HE ENHANCE ACCESS TO FEDERAL MEAL PROGRAMS WHEN SCHOOL IS NOT IN SESSION AND PROVIDES GREATER OFFERINGS OF CALIFORNIA BROWN SUITS. WHILE THE STATE WHILE ONGOING STATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSAL PROGRAM IS A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT. WE NEED TO INVEST IN OUR CHILDREN THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS. OF COURSE THERE LONG TERM POTENTIAL TO THRIVE. ONE SEED CANNOT PROVIDE A DEFINITIVE COST BREAKDOWN FOR A CALIFORNIA UNIVERSAL MEAL PROGRAM AT THIS TIME. OUR PRELIMINARY PROJECTED ESTIMATE IS ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AS AN ONGOING INVESTMENT IN LOCAL ASSISTANCE AND APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILLION IN CD COSTS. IT'S CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY CAN FRENZAL WHOSE CD IS DIRECTOR OF NUTRITION SERVICES. WE ARE HAPPY TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. AND SO CAN FRIENDS THOSE JUST AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE PERCENT DECLINE YES SIR GREAT JUST CHECKING. THEN MS ORTIZ ARE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE- YOUR UP. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU THIS MORNING MY NAME IS DEBORAH ORTIZ AND I'M A FOOD SERVICES DELIVERY DRIVER FOR THE RESPONSE CITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT I'VE WORKED FOR THE CHURCH SERVICES DEPARTMENT FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AND I'M CSTA MEMBER. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE AS AN ESSENTIAL WORKER WHO'S BEEN WORKING ONSITE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PANDEMIC IN ANSWERING THE THREE PROVIDED QUESTIONS QUESTION NUMBER ONE WHAT WAS THE EXPERIENCE AND FOOD SERVICE EMPLOYEES DURING THE PANDEMIC AND WHAT CHALLENGES ARE FACED IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS IN THE COMING SCHOOL YEAR. THE WAS US FOR. AND REWARD WHEN ALL THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE DISTRICT WERE SHUT DOWN I'M WORKING FROM HOME. WE WERE AT WORK FEEDING OUR STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES. WE CONTINUE TO WORK EVERY DAY SPRING BREAK INCLUDING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T STILL NEEDED SEATS. WILL MANY OTHER PRIVATE SECTOR FOOD SERVICE WITH A WORKERS RECEIVING HAZARDS HEY WE DID NOT. WE HAD TO WORK DOING WHAT WAS NEEDED TO BE DONE THE SAME WAGES. IT WAS THE LOWEST PAID WORKERS IN THE DISTRICTS THAT CONTINUE TO DO OUR JOBS. OUR NEW NORM BECAME OUT SUNGLASSES AND WORKING OUTSIDE IN THE HEAT OR COLD. WITHOUT PROPER EQUIPMENT TO COOL OURSELVES FOR THE FED. BEING SHORT STAFFED BECAME A DAILY OCCURRENCE ONLY EMPLOYEES FROM ONE SIDE TO COVER ANOTHER IS DONE REGULARLY. JOBS ARE POSTED REPEATEDLY WITH NO APPLICANTS. PART TIME LOW PAYING AND AT A HIGHER RISK OF EXPOSURE. THESE POSITIONS CONTINUE TO GO ON STAFF AND WILL BE A BIG FACTOR IN THE COMING SCHOOL YEAR. FOR THIS REASON IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE EXTEND THE LAST MARCH OR IN OUR FOOD SERVICE WORKERS WORKING IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO PROVIDE OUR LOWEST WAGE EARNERS. WITH ADDITIONAL PAY AND MORE HOURS. MANY FOOD SERVICE WORKERS ARE EARNING THE MINIMUM WAGE OR SLIGHTLY MORE THESE ARE THE SAME WORKERS WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF. AND I'M- HAVING TO CONTINUALLY ADAPT TO CONSTANT CHANGES HAS BEEN TOUGH AND COMMUNICATION IS AN ISSUE. THE DISTRICT IS IN THE PROCESS OF FIGURING OUT HOW WILL BE SERVING LUNCHES IN THE COMING SCHOOL YEAR. WE HAVE BEEN SERVING GRAB AND GO STYLE COLD. BUT THE DISTRICT WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO A MORE TRADITIONAL HOT LUNCH ON A TRAY. IF WE RETURN TO HOT LUNCHES NOT BEING FULLY STAFFED THIS WILL BE A BIG CHALLENGE. YES THROUGHOUT ALL OF THE GRATITUDE THAT FAMILIES HAVE EXPRESSED ASK ME THIS WILL TRULY APPRECIATE. QUESTION NUMBER TWO HOW DO SCHOOL DISTRICTS STOP SUMMER MEAL PROGRAMS MY DISTRICT THE SENATE INTEREST FORM. AND THEN SELECT PEOPLE TO WORK BASED ON DISTRICT NEEDS AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE A SERVICE STATE CERTIFICATE. MOST FOOD SERVICE STAFF OR TEN MONTH. EMPLOYEES IF YOU WORK THIS SUMMER MY SINCE YOU WILL NOT THE SAME. AS A TWELVE MONTH EMPLOYEE WHAT. FOR HE WOULD NOT BE A- SICK. AS A TEN MONTH EMPLOYEE WOULD ACCRUE TENTS DAYS. AS A TWELVE MONTH TO BUT APPROVED TO. SO EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE ALL MONTHS BUT LET OUT THE ADDITION. TWO SIX. QUESTION NUMBER THREE WHAT IS NEEDED TO HELP SERVICE. TO DO THEIR JOB SAFELY. TRAINING A QUICK AND P. TRAINING IS ESSENTIAL DO ANY JOB THEY- TEACHERS REGULAR GET PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT DAYS. WHAT PROVIDE CLASSES EMPLOYEE WITH HER. DEVELOPMENT FOOD SERVICE WORKERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE CONTINUING EDUCATION HOURS. THEY ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO HAVE A SERVE SAVE CERTIFICATE EITHER A MANAGER CERTIFICATE OR- CERTIFICATE. MY DISTRICT PROVIDES A BOOK FOR STUDYING AND OCCASIONALLY A COUPLE HOURS AGO RUBIO. MANY PEOPLE DO NOT PASS THE TEST THE FIRST TIME TO TAKE IT AND MUST TAKE IT SEVERAL TIMES. HAVING COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING AND PRACTICE TESTS WOULD BE ERY HELPFUL AND DECREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVING TO RETAKE THE TEST. EQUIPMENT NEEDS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THE WAY WE ARE PACKAGING FOOD AND SERVING HAS CHANGED. HAVING THE PROPER TOOLS TO DO THE JOB INSTEAD OF MAKING DO WITH WHAT WE HAVE. WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN SAFETY. SIMPLE THINGS LIKE PROVIDING FOOD SERVICE WORKERS WITH CARTS TO MOVE BOXES OF SHOES ARE PROVIDED TO TENTS THAT HANDLES. INSTEAD OF AWKWARD CARDBOARD BOXES WOULD HELP INCREASE SAFETY. OUR FOOD SERVICE WAREHOUSE DOESN'T HAVE A LARGE AND A WALK IN REFRIGERATOR OR FREEZER. TO ACCOMMODATE THE AMOUNT. WE ARE NOW BRINGING IN WEEK WHAT. THE VOLUME OF FOOD HAS INCREASED TREMENDOUSLY SINCE THE MAY ALSO ANNOUNCE WE ALL STUDENTS AND WE ARE PACKAGING THE MEALS. MANY SCHOOLS DID NOT OFFER BREAKFAST BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WHICH WE ARE NOW PROVIDING. THIS IS INCREASE THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THE JOB AND MAKE THINGS LIKE PROPER LIFTING MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO AVOID INJURIES. WITH THE PROSPECT OF KIDS RETURNING TO THE LUNCH ROOMS PLEXIGLAS BARRIERS WILL NEED TO BE INSTALLED IN THE SERVING AREAS TO KEEP STAFF PROTECT IT. AND OF COURSE THE NEED. FOR PP CONTINUES PLEASE KEEP THE MASS AND CLASS COMING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- JUST BEFORE WE MOVED TO JENNIFER LOVE THERE LET ME SAY THAT. BECAUSE OF MS ORTIZ HAS A TIME CONSTRAINT IF ANYBODY HAS. QUESTIONS FOR HER WE'RE GOING TO MOVE THOSE TO THE TOP THE MINUTE WE GET DONE WITH THE NEXT TO. SO EVEN- MICHAEL. HAVE QUEST FOR ME OR TWO. I HAVE THE READY FOR THE TIME. SO WE'LL MOVE TO J. LEBEAU THE X. TO. OF STOOD ATTRITION SERVICES AT ST FRANCISCO UNIFIED. TO THE COMMITTEE. THE MORNING JENNIFER HARDS ARE KIND OF DIRECTOR AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH DEBORAH FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE DONE. THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC AND I'M GETTING A LITTLE- THE COUNTRY NOW FOR- THE WORDS EITHER STASH IT'S BEEN MY HONOR TO WORK IN SCHOOL NUTRITION FOR TWENTY YEARS. AND ONE OF THE REASON IT'S BEEN HONOR IS BECAUSE I GET TO WORK WITH PEOPLE LIKE YOU. WHO HAVE DONE THE WORK IN THIS WORK AND TO CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK BECAUSE YOU PRIORITIZE THE CHILDREN THAT WE SERVE. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THIS IS NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH YOU'RE A WEEK AND WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING YOU EVERY SINGLE WEEK AND THIS IS A SPECIAL WAY TO CELEBRATE PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE- I'M HERE. TO TALK TO YOU ALL. THE IMPACT UNIVERSAL MEALS CAN HAVE ON CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN IN FAMILIES AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE THIS CRITICAL MOVED. TO BE THE FIRST IN THE NATION. TO MAKE SCHOOL MEALS FREE FOR ALL CHILDREN. MARCH THIRTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED MADE THE DECISION TO CLOSE SCHOOLS. IN RESPONSE TO THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WE DIDN'T THINK HE WAS ONLY GOING TO BE THREE WEEKS UNTIL WE RE OPENED OUR SCHOOLS AGAIN. WE CREATED. GRABBING GOES AND MULTIPLE COVERED RESPONSE MEALS AND AFTER FOURTEEN MONTHS AND LINES OF PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WRAPPING AROUND CITY BLOCKS AND NEARLY SEVEN MILLION MEALS LATER. WE HAVE SEEN THAT EVEN IN THE CITY OF WEALTH LIKE SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO FREE MEALS ARE NEEDED. THE LINES OF ADULTS REPRESENT A LINES OF CHILDREN WE NORMALLY SEE IN CAFETERIAS PATIENTLY WAITING FOR THE ONLY THING THAT ISN'T FREE AND OUR FREE EDUCATION SYSTEM. ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS YOU NEED IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED TO LEARN MEALS. FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS I HAVE SEEN THE IMPACTS OF THIS INEQUITY HAS HAD ON CHILDREN THEIR FAMILIES AND THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. WELL MALES ARE STIGMATIZED IN EVERY SCHOOL WHERE THEY ARE NOT FREE FOR ALL AND AS A RESULT CHILDREN WILL CHOOSE NOT TO EAT. TO AVOID BEING SEEN AS A POOR KID. EARNS WILL REFUSE TO COMPLETE THE MAIL APPLICATION SO THAT THEY ARE NOT SEEN AS A POOR FAMILY. BECAUSE OF THIS IT WILL STRETCH THEIR ALREADY TIGHT BUDGETS TO SEND LUNCHES FOR THEIR CHILDREN. NINE TIMES WHEN BOTH THE MONEY AND THE FOOD STAMPS RUN OUT OR MOM IS STILL BUSY SHE FORGETS WHICH JUST HAPPENED TO ME. THIS YOU KNOW WILL COME THROUGH WHERE ONE FINDS AND WE WILL PROVIDE THE MEAL. AND BECAUSE SAN FRANCISCO LIKE MANY DISTRICTS DID BEFORE LEGISLATION MANDATED IT WILL PROVIDE THAT MAIL AND NOT WORRY ABOUT COLLECTING THERE'S NO FEES. THE DISTRICT GENERAL FUND WILL TAKE ON THAT DEBT IMPACTING THE FUNDING FOR CLASSROOMS. THE OTHER SCENARIO THAT HAPPENS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND MANY OTHER DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA AS HAS BEEN ATTESTED TO BY THE WITNESSES BEFORE ME. FAMILY SIMPLY DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS. DID YOU KNOW THAT A FAMILY OF FOUR CAN MAKE NO MORE THAN FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TO QUALIFY FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS. THE FEDERAL INCOME GUIDELINES SIMPLY DO NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA WHERE EVEN THE DIFFERENCES WITHIN OUR OWN STATE. THE AVERAGE RANGE IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE SQUARE FOOT APARTMENT IS TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. WELL IN MY HOMETOWN OF BAKERSFIELD ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS WILL DO THE JOB. SO WE REPEAT THE SAME CYCLE WHERE FAMILIES BUDGET IS STRETCHED. THEY MAKE GOOD CHOICES THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE A LUNCH DINNER CRUISE. YOU MAY ASK WHAT ABOUT THE COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY PROVISION OR C. ISN'T THAT A SOLUTION. I GREW RESPOND THAT MANY DISTRICTS IN CAMBY BUT FOR MANY IT IS NOT IN MY FORMER DISTRICT I WAS ABLE TO PUT SEVENTY ONE OUT OF EIGHTY SIX SCHOOLS ON THAT PROGRAM. WOW MY DEPARTMENT WAS PROVIDING FREE MEALS FOR ALL CHILDREN AT THE SEVENTY ONE SCHOOLS WE WERE NOT RECEIVING FREE REIMBURSEMENT FOR ALL OF THOSE MEALS AND FOR THE CHILDREN AT THE FIFTEEN SCHOOLS WITHOUT PHOEBE THE BILL PROGRAM WAS STILL STIGMATIZED. IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAD OVER FIFTY SCHOOLS ON CD BUT WHEN WE HAD TO RENEW FOR THE PROGRAM AT THE END OF THE FOUR YEARS. WE WENT TO IS ONLY TWENTY BECAUSE THIRTY SITES NO LONGER QUALIFY DUE TO THE SHIFTING INCOMES AND THE PRIOR FEDERAL MINISTRATIONS USE OF PUBLIC CHARGE. FAMILIES WHO NEEDED CALFRESH IN CAL WORKS STOPPED PLYING FOR AND RECEIVING THOSE BENEFITS. BECAUSE THE BASIS FOR THE SEAVIEW QUALIFICATIONS WORK HOW WORKS IN CALFRESH. EVEN WITH THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO C. P. IN AMERICA'S FAMILY PLAN IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 43% OF CALIFORNIA. SCHOOLS WITH STILL NOT QUALIFY. C. HAS BEEN THE FOR GOVERNMENT STEP TOWARD. MEALS BUT WE CAN DO MORE AND WE NEED TO DO MORE. TO PROVIDED BY FEEDING AMERICA SHOW THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE STUDENTS EACH YEAR AND THAT ELEVEN POINT TWO MILLION CHILDREN. ONE IN SEVEN LIVED IN FOOD INSECURE HOMES. DEMONSTRATED THE FAMILIES LIVE ON A WIRES EDGE WE'VE ALL HEARD THE ADAGE LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. BUT THE PANDEMIC REVEAL THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE FAR MORE DIRE. WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THIS CAN DAMAGE AND DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOLS COULD BE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF FREE MEALS FOR ALL HOUSEHOLDS. THE WEST SIDE OF SAN FRANCISCO TYPICALLY WEALTHY ECONOMICALLY SEARCH YOUR HOMES. SO THE LARGEST EMISSION OF UNEMPLOYMENT APPLICATIONS AT ONE POINT DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE ALSO A NEW STORY SHOWING MILES LONG LINES AT THE BANKS FAMILIES WHO NEVER THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE FOOD INSECURE. WHERE WE WHERE WE ARE COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC'S FAMILIES WILL BE FEELING THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS FOR YEARS TO COME. CALIFORNIANS ARE ALSO FEELING THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES OF THE WILDFLOWERS WILDFIRES RATHER. AND OTHER ECONOMIC. AND ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS. WE DO NOT KNOW WHEN AND WHERE THEY WILL STRIKE BEAT THE IMPACT US ALL. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE FREE EMAILS WITHOUT COMPLETING A MEAL APPLICATION IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS. INVESTORS CAN RECEIVE THE NECESSARY FUNDING WHEN PROVIDING THESE MEALS. MANY HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT THE MOVIE UNIVERSAL MEALS WILL HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON HOW SCHOOLS RECEIVE THEIR FUNDING. SPECIFICALLY OF ALL STUDENTS RECEIVE FREE EMAILS THE INCENTIVE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS NECESSARY TO FIND SCHOOLS WILL GO AWAY. THE CHALLENGE THIS NOTION WE DON'T LOOK AT SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO A SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED ALTERNATIVE INCOME FORMS FOR THEIR C. P. SITES. FOR EXAMPLE STEPHANIE BRUCE IN PALM SPRINGS HAS SCHOOLS CONTACT FAMILIES ASKING THEM TO COMPLETE THESE FORMS SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE PROPER FUNDING FOR THEIR CHILD'S CLASSROOM. I KNOW THERE ARE MANY CONGRESO TO BE HAD. I KNOW THERE ARE MANY PRIORITIES I KNOW MANY ARE SAYING SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE GETTING A LOT OF MONEY. LET ME SAY THIS TO YOU. UNIVERSAL MEALS NEED TO BE IN EVERY CONVERSATION. PROVIDING FREE MEALS AND OUR FREE EDUCATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE A PRIORITY. WE NEED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO ENSURE EVERY STUDENT HAS THEIR NEEDS MET. SO THAT THEY CAN BE PREPARED TO LEARN. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR HEROES AND SHE ROES ARE TAKING CARE OF IN THEIR JOBS. THE TIME FOR UNIVERSAL MEALS IS NOW. AND I'M HERE TO TAKE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. ANDREW FROM THE FOODBANKS EUROPE. THANK YOU SURELY MEMBERS- WE ALL AGREE NO CHILD SHOULD GO HUNGRY IN OUR GREAT STATE YET THE SHAMEFUL REALITY IS THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE CONFRONTING HUNGER CRISIS. ACCORDING TO MOST RECENT DATA FROM THE SENSORS HOUSEHOLD POLL SURVEY NEARLY A QUARTER OF CALIFORNIAN HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN ARE FOOD INSECURE WITH DEEP INJUSTICES FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. 27% OF FAMILIES IDENTIFYING IS NOT NEXT 30% OF THOSE IDENTIFYING AS MULTI RACIAL AN ASTONISHING. THIRTY FIVE POINT 5% OF BLACK HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN CORPORATE SECURITY. THE RESEARCH IS CRYSTAL CLEAR ON THE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES OF CHILDHOOD HUNGER NOT ONLY YOUR CHILDREN BUT OUR SOCIETY AND A SIGNAL OF HOW URGENT IT IS TO ADDRESS AND PREVENT IT. EVEN ONE INCIDENT OF CHILDHOOD HUNGER CAN HAVE CONSEQUENCES LASTING INTO ADULTHOOD. THIS COMES NOT ONLY FROM THE PHYSICAL PAIN OF HUNGER BUT THE TOXIC STRESS OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY FOR FOOD. AND NOT KNOWING WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL MAY COME FROM. AND FOR CHILDREN WE KNOW THAT IS ALL TOO REAL EVEN THE SCHOOL MEALS ARE OFTEN THE ONLY TO EAT DURING THE DAY AND A GREAT HARDSHIPS WE'VE HEARD- BUT BETTER THAN I CAN DESCRIBE MY PREVIOUS WITNESSES. THAT KOBE IS PUT ON SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES I WOULD ALSO LIFT UP THAT WAS SCHOOL AND HEROES ON FRIDAY WE CELEBRATE THE AMAZING WORK OF DEBORAH JENNIFER AND EVERYONE- TO CONTINUE TO FEED CHILDREN. TO THIS CRISIS MY GRATITUDE. AS A POLICY RESPONSE. WHICH OF COURSE FOCUS ON. CHILDREN FIRST. AND APPLAUD THE- OF THE- AND PARTICULARLY THE SENATE TO DO THAT. BUT HUNGRY CHILDREN LIVE IN EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WE WILL LEAVE THEM BEHIND IF WE DO NOT ADOPT POLICIES TO ACHIEVE FREE SCHOOL MEALS FOR ALL CHILDREN. WE ALREADY HEARD FROM MISSILE ARE BUT I WOULD JUST HIGHLY- THAT THE NATIONAL DATA FROM FEEDING AMERICA SHOW THAT 29% ALMOST A THIRD OF CHILDREN. WHO ARE FOOD INSECURE LIVE ABOVE THE INCOME THRESHOLDS WHICH WE ALREADY HEARD ARE FAR TOO LOW. THAT DYNAMIC IS WORSENED WITH THE PRESSURE. OF LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES STATING FACING GREATER COSTS DURING THE OPEN. LACK OF PUBLIC TRANSIT. UP YOU KNOW- HE BEAT OTHER POSSIBLE INCOME FAMILY SPACE. AS WELL LOW INCOME FAMILIES- IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES DOING ESSENTIAL WORK TO POWER OUR ECONOMY TO FEED THE REST OF US. ARE ELIGIBLE AND ARE FRIED AFRAID APPLY. AT ALL. PERSONALLY OF THESE I AM ARE TO. YOUR DISTRICT. BUT SECOND HARVEST STILL CAN BE. SERVING SO MANY FAMILY JUST ABOUT THE INCOME THRESHOLD AND SECOND PERSON SANTA CRUZ. DEALING WITH SUCH DEEP COMMUNITY FEARS THEY HAD TO DEVELOP UNDERGROUND FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS. AND WE KNOW THAT SAME CHILLING EFFECT IS KEPT SO MANY FAMILIES WERE ELIGIBLE. FROM APPLYING FOR PUBLIC GOOD PROGRAMS LIKE SCHOOL MEALS. MEANWHILE AS WE ALREADY HEARD SUCH CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS MUCH PROGRAMS HAVE GONE DEEP INTO DEBT DUE TO THE HIGHER COSTS AND LOWER REIMBURSEMENTS. THAT MEAL MAYBE IT HAS BEEN A LIFELINE FOR CHILDREN BEEN A HARDSHIP FOR SCHOOLS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE BENEFITS OF FREE SCHOOL MEALS FOR ALL CHILDREN ARE LEGION. HOUSE UNIVERSITY CAME OUT JUST TWO WEEKS AGO SCHOOLS ARE THAT SINGLE HEALTHIEST PLACE AMERICANS ARE EATING. THE RIGHT CENTER HAS FOUND THAT SCHOOLS CAN LOWER COSTS. BY MOVING TO UNIVERSAL MALES BUT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW HOW MANY MEALS ARE PURCHASING THE PLAN FOR THAT AND THE PURCHASE IN BULK. AND WE JUST HEARD FROM JENNIFER LOVE ARE BUT THE ABILITY TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL PROVISIONS. SO HE SAID HE SAID MOST OF ALL THOUGH THAT SCHOOL MEALS FOR ALL IMPROVE STUDENT ATTENDANCE BEHAVIOR ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. IT'S IMPROVED SCORES IN SPELLING READING AND MATH DIETARY INTAKE PROTECTING A CHILD TO THE- OF THE CITY AND CURRENT GROUP INSURANCE MENTAL HEALTH. BY REDUCING ANXIETY DEPRESSION HYPERACTIVITY. I JUST HAD TO MAKE THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE'VE LEARNED THAT WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE THANKS TO THE WAIVERS THAT CD YOU MENTIONED WE HAVE THE TOOLS TO WRITE SCHOOL MEALS FOR ALL WE MUST CONTINUE THIS VITAL POLICY. THE WAY SCHOOL CAMPUSES ARE CLOSED THOSE OUT OF SCHOOL TIMES OR THE HUNGRIEST FOR CHILDREN ACCORDING TO THE FOOD RESEARCH AND ACTION CENTER IN TWENTY NINETEEN ONLY 16% OF CHILDREN RECEIVED A SUMMER MEAL. FOOD BANKS ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF CHILD HUNGER EVERY TIME SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED FOR BREAKS OR UNANTICIPATED DISASTERS. AND WE SUPPORT THE VISION OUTLINED BY CD WE LEARN THE PANDEMIC THAT THE BEST POLICY IS TO ENSURE THAT GRAB AND GO MEALS ARE AVAILABLE AS WELL AS SCHOOL MEAL REPLACEMENT B. B. T. BENEFITS AND I'VE SENT INFORMATION FROM. THE NATIONAL EMERSON CONGRESSIONAL HUNGER CENTER FELLOW THAT WE WERE PROUD TO HOST WE SPOKE WITH FOURTEEN HUNDRED LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA FAMILIES OVERWHELMINGLY LAST NEXT ASIAN AMERICAN WHO SPOKE TO THE NEED FOR THAT BOTH AND APPROACH. FINALLY GRANTS ARE THE BEST WAY TO INVEST IN SCHOOL MEALS% SUPPORTING CALIFORNIA'S INCREDIBLE FARMERS IN OUR FOOD ECONOMY HELPING OUR SCHOOLS AND TO PURCHASE ENTER SCHOOL NUTRITION WORKFORCE YOUR PARENTS SERVE FRESH HEALTHY CALIFORNIA GROWN FOODS WHAT A POWERFUL TRIPLE WIN. TO CREATE JOBS IMPROVE HEALTH AND FIGHT HUNGER. LAST PARENTS OF HUNGRY KIDS CANNOT SAVE FOR A RAINY DAY THEY HAVE TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION WE NEED THE STATE TO DO THE SAME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION BOTH PROPOSALS. OR HUNGER HE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH REALLY OF- YOUR COM. THAT COMPLETES THE PANEL PRESENTATIONS FOR THE FIRST ITEM AND I WAS GOING TO THE TO IN A MINUTE ASK IF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE A QUESTION IN ANY WAY FOR MS ORTIZ BUT LET ME JUST SAY THAT- THAT I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE AND SHE ANSWERED THAT SO WELL DURING HER. PRESENTATION I DON'T THINK THERE'S A NEED TO PASS A QUESTION AND SECONDLY I THINK KELLI GARNER OF FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SPOKESMAN WRONGLY ABOUT THE ROLE OF FOOD SERVICE WORKERS AND I THINK JENNIFER LEBAR MADE A STATEMENT THAT. ARE COULD NOT BE EQUAL BY ANY OF US IN TERMS OF THAT TRIBUTE TO NOT ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND SO I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS EXCEPT TO THANK HER FOR BEING HERE AND I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR DEBORAH ORTIZ. SENATOR GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF THE- PANELS OF SPEAKING THIS MORNING IN TAKING TIME OUT TO COME IS GIVE YOUR PERSPECTIVE. FOR THE FOR THE INFORMATION I DID HAVE A QUESTION- FOR DEBORAH- MISTER TEE'S FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE SERVICE THAT YOU PROVIDED THIS PAST YEAR AND I COULD SEE THAT COMMITMENT IN THE HEART YOU HAVE FOUR CHILDREN AND MAKING SURE THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE MET- I ABSOLUTELY EMPATHIZE WITH YOU AND- I HAVE TO SAY I WAS ONE OF THOSE. PEOPLE THAT WERE VOLUNTEERING AND I'M- HANDING OUT LUNCHES LAST SUMMER IN THE MIDDLE HE'S OUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT- AND- HAVING GREAT JOY. AND JUST I HAVE TO SAY IT WAS SO. WONDERFUL TO SEE THE FACES OF OUR KIDS. HOME I HAD NOT SEEN. FOR WELL IN THE SUMMER PROGRAM THREE MONTHS AND TO SEE THEM. GOING THROUGH THE LINE WITH THEIR FAMILIES WAS JUST AN ABSOLUTE JOY TO SEE THOSE FAMILIES THAT I RECOGNIZE IN THOSE KIDS THAT I RECOGNIZE IS. JUST ABSOLUTELY JOIN FOR A LOT OF US. I DO HAVE A QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO SOME OF THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH YOU WERE WORKING. I'M INCLUDING AS- THE PAY AND- THE DAYS THAT YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE- THAT YOU DON'T GET ENTITLED FOR WORKING THROUGH THE MONTH OF. DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. ARE THOSE ELEMENTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE NEGOTIATED WITHIN- AT THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE NEEDS ARE BEING MET OR THOSE DEMANDS ARE BEING THAT ARE NEGOTIATED WITH. IT'S NOT CONTRACTED TIME FOR US LIKE I SAID MOST. SERVICE EMPLOYEES ARE TEN MONTH EMPLOYEES SO THE EXTRA TWO MONTHS ARE GOING ON A TIME SHEET. SO WORLDLY ACCRUING THE BENEFITS OF SICK LEAVE DURING CONTRACTED TIME. SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE- SOME FOOD SERVICE POSITIONS BECOME TWELFTH MONTH POSITIONS. BECAUSE I DON'T SEE SOME REPEATING GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON. SO IN THE THIRTEEN YEARS THAT I'VE WORKED FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT I HAVE WORKED EVERY SUMMER. AND HAVE NEVER QUITE SICKLY FOR THE MONTHS THAT I WORKED DURING THE SUMMER. SO MY QUESTION AND I'M SORRY I LET ME SEE IF I CAN. PHRASE IT A DIFFERENT WAY I'M TO BE MORE CLEARLY- AND- WITH REGARDS TO WHAT I'M I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. EVEN AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE ARE THOSE COUNTRIES ARE TEN MONTHS BUT FOR THE MINES WERE YOU'RE CONTRACTED TO WORK FOR THOSE TWO MONTHS. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE NEGOTIATED AND- AND EXPRESSED AT THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT AS FAR AS THE TERMS AND WHAT BENEFITS YOU RECEIVE. DURING THOSE TWO MONTHS. I'M I WOULD LIKE TO TRY I KNOW THAT WE ARE PUTTING SOME. AT STUFF WRITING FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME TEN MONTH POSITIONS TURNED INTO A TWELVE MONTH POSITION- BUT I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW- ECHOED WELL ENOUGH TO TELL YOU IF THE DISTRICT CAN GET AROUND IT BY SAYING IT'S NOT CONTRACTED TIME. OR IF IT'S YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE JUST NEGOTIATED. SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE PAST AS FAR AS WE'RE LOOKING OUT FOR THAT CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE ASK OUR- OF OUR OUR OUR- BEING- NEGOTIATED OR CONTRACTED WITH FOR THE SUMMER. YEAH I DON'T I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T ANSWER THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO TALK TO SOMEBODY MAYBE A HIGHER UP AND CSEA THE ANSWER THAT I DON'T KNOW IF IT- MAKES A DIFFERENCE THAT PEOPLE ARE THEY TAKE BASICALLY- IF THEY PUT OUT INTEREST FORMS SO I MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HAVING A CHOICE MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN WHETHER OR NOT YOU GET THE BENEFITS ARE NOT JUST IT DOESN'T SEEM EQUITABLE TO ME THAT I DON'T GET THE BENEFIT OF BEING A TWELVE MONTH EMPLOYED BY AND WORKING TWELVE MONTHS. TEN I THINK JENNIFER LEBAR RAISED HER HAND IS THAT BECAUSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO HELP. ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YES PLEASE DO OKAY THANK YOU. SO THESE ARE. IT THEY LEAVE IS ASSOCIATED WITH A NUMBER OF MONTHS THAT YOU ARE WORKING. AND SO THAT THE WAY THAT CAN BE RESOLVED IS AROUND MAKING THESE POSITIONS THAT A TWELVE MONTH POSITION IF THE WORK IS. AT AND I THINK THERE IS A CASE TO BE MADE IN A LOT OF SITUATIONS WHERE THE JOB IS. A TWELVE MONTH JOB BUT IT'S TYPICALLY WHERE THESE ARE TEN MONTHS JOBS BECAUSE THE SUMMER SCHOOL DOESN'T GO THE WHOLE THE WHOLE SUMMER. AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M- THAT IS DONE BUT I THINK THERE'S MORE AND MORE BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN AND BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE THINGS. THAT SOME 12-1 JOBS CAN BE CREATED AND THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT ENDEAVOR IS ALSO REFERRING TO. AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE THIS CAN BE MADE I DON'T THINK YOU CAN MAKE THE CASE FOR ALL. OF THE JOBS TO BE TWELVE MONTHS. CAN MAKE THE CASE FOR A NUMBER OF THE JOBS TO BE TWELVE MONTHS AND SO THAT'S A THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT CAN HAPPEN. BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE IS THE ABILITY WITHIN THE AND COACH TO- ADD- OR TO ACCRUE THE TEN MONTHS BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO GOING TO VARY FROM SCHOOL DISTRICT TO SCHOOL DISTRICT. IN HANDING ON WHAT THE SITUATION IS AT THAT SCHOOL SO IT IS A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT- YES PROVOCATIVE. YES OKAY. PERFECT SECOND PLEASE. YOUR QUESTION SENATOR MAN. THANK YOU- LAST I JUST TO FIRST THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR CUSTOMER. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A AND- IMPORTANT- AS YOU ARE ELOQUENTLY DESCRIBED- IT'S HARD TO EXPECT OUR STUDENTS TO LEARN WHEN THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER AND EMAILS COMING FROM AND- FOOD INSECURITIES UNFORTUNATELY RAMPANT ACROSS THE STATE- I WANTED TO ASK MR KEYES. YOU'RE ON THE GROUND AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE STATE. HAS YOU KNOW SOME INCREDIBLE IDEAS ON. HOW TO DE STIGMATIZE- THESE LUNCHES HOW TO GET. PEOPLE TO TAKE THEM OUT BUT WE STILL HAVE A HUGE GAP IN. FOOD INSECURITY AND NUMBER STUDENTS THAT ARE TAKING THIS SO. IF IN YOUR EXPERIENCE WHAT CAN WE DO TO TRY TO INCREASE TAKE UP WHAT CAN WE DO TO GET MORE STUDENTS A COMMON. ACTUALLY PICK UP THESE MEALS. IT I IT'S REALLY UP. THAT THERE'S CHOICE AND STATE- I KNOW OUR OPTIONS FOR WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PUT INTO THE LUNCHES GRAB AND GO STYLE. I HAVE BEEN A LIMITING FACTOR- I CAN TELL YOU THAT DEPENDING ON WHAT IS IN THE BACK MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE ON IF THE KIDS TAKE THE BACK- SO JUST. GOOD FOOD OPTIONS LIKE KNOW FRESH THE FIRST. YOU KNOW FARM TO SCHOOL PROGRAM AND GETTING. GETTING GOOD QUALITY INGREDIENTS INTO THE LUNCHES I THINK THIS IS CRITICAL. ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OPTIONS. M. WELL IT'S HARD RIGHT NOW BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS BEEN COLD SO WE'RE DEALING WITH THE COLD FOOD IN THE KIDS DEFINITELY DO YOU PREFER A HOT OPTIONS IN OUR DISTRICT SO IF THEY DO GO BACK TO- YOU KNOW PUTTING A HOT ITEM THEN I MEAN SOME OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN GIVING- THAT'S FROZEN AND THEY TAKE IT HOME FOR EXAMPLE- THEY'RE NOT AS INCLINED TO TAKE AND I DON'T THINK WHEN IT'S FROZEN BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MUCH ON ON THE WAY HOME. SO HAVING SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW THEY CAN JUST. AARON TO BECAUSE THEY'RE HUNGRY- IS A GOOD THING THEY LIKE SANDWICHES THEY LIKE BURGERS YOU KNOW AND LOVE PIZZA. BEGINNING A PRESENT SLICE OF PIZZA IS DEFINITELY NOT AS APPEALING AS GETTING A NICE. WARM SMELLS GOOD LOOKS GOOD HE SAID HE SAID THAT YOU CAN EAT. THEIR KIDS BASICALLY. THERE CAN'T YEAH. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS. THIRTY THREE SHARES YOU'RE WELCOME. THAT'S YOU BETTER THE IT'S- TO A- CENTER REMAINED TO. THAT TO KIDS AS IF ADULTS WOULD NOT WANT. TO REFERENCE AND PEOPLE. SENATOR A JOB. I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AS WELL AND- UNDERSTANDING. IS THERE ANY- INCINERATION AND- I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TO ACCOMMODATE SPECIALLY FOR TALKING ABOUT UNIVERSAL BREAKFAST AND LUNCHES HAS THERE BEEN ANY ACCOMMODATIONS OR ANYTHING OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH REGARD TO FOOD SENSITIVITIES- AND DIET RESTRICTIONS FOR MANY OF OUR CHILDREN AND HOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT BETTER WORK THAT IN IN THE MATTER THAT YOU FOLKS ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE UNIVERSAL WITH MEAL PLANS AND THEN SECOND TO THAT AND I'LL JUST FOLLOW UP BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE. WHO WOULD BE THE BEST PERSON TO ANSWER BUT THEN- WITH REGARDS TO- OF COURSE PLANNING- AND- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY CHILDREN YOU'RE GOING TO BE FEEDING THE COST OF THAT IN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MEALS THAT ARE NOT BEING UTILIZED OR THE FUNDS THEY'RE NOT BEING UTILIZED. TO ADAM. TO COMEDY THAT DAY ALL OF THE CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL IN A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IN WHICH THAT DIRECTED TO MS ORTIZ. I'M I DON'T I'M NOT SURE ABOUT MR TEAS BUT I BELIEVE THAT IT MIGHT BE THE THING IS. IT I WANNA. I WANNA GET TO THAT BUT SHE HAS A HARD STOP OF FIVE MINUTES FROM NOW SO I WAS JUST TRYING TO DO THE FIRST QUESTIONS DIRECTED TO HER SO THAT. THAT WE COVERED AND IF YOU'RE DONE WITH THOSE QUESTIONS OF HER AND SHE WAS OUR TEAS COULD ANSWER THAT MR JEEZ I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GIVE WHAT WAS GOING TO BE ONE OF MY GLOBAL QUESTIONS HEADING OKAY. AND SO WE WILL NOT LET IT DROP OKAY. BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HONOR MISS ORTIZ'S TIME BEFORE SHE HAD TO GO ABSENT ANYTHING ELSE FOR MS ORTIZ. THEN LET ME FOR YOU FOR BEING HERE AND STAY AS LONG AS YOU CAN BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO GO TO WORK IN A FEW MINUTES. AND WEBER. AND IF YOU ARE STILL HERE. AND THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO SAY JUST RAISE YOUR HAND BUT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE AND TO WE APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU DO. THANK YOU. AND THEN LET ME. GO TO THE TOP OF THE GLOBAL QUESTIONS. A. N. N. MAKE LET ME MAKE A COMMENT FIRST PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF- I THINK. ANDREW MADE A POINT THAT I WANTED TO MAKE IT THE OPENING WHICH IS THAT WE ARE TALKING HERE. ABOUT SCHOOL NUTRITION. pWHAT WE CAN DO IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SUB COMMITTEE. HOWEVER THE EFFORTS THAT ARE BROADER THAN WHAT WE DO HERE. DEFINITELY IMPACT THIS DISCUSSION AND DOUBLE. AND DEFINITELY IMPACT WHETHER WE CAN MEET THE NUTRITION NEEDS OF KIDS. AND WITH SPECIFIC REFERENCE THE ONE THING HE SAID- ARM. ROUGHLY A MONTH AGO I WENT. TO THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION OF SECOND HARVEST AT THE FAIRGROUNDS IN SANTA CRUZ AND WATSONVILLE. I WAS JUST FLOORED AT HOW LONG THE LINES WERE. AND THEY ARE- DAY PASSED SOME OF THEM IF THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO TALK TO ME. AND I SPEAK SPANISH AND A LOT OF THE MORE SPANISH SPEAKING. OF PEOPLE GETTING FOOD. AND IT WAS PEOPLE THAT HAD BEEN WORKING IN THE FIELDS OR HAD BEEN WORKING IN THE PACKING SHEDS OR HAD BEEN WORKING IN GENERAL THERE WERE KIDS IN THE CAR THAT WE'RE PICKING UP THE FOOD WITH THEM CONCERT WAS REALLY CLEAR. THAT FOOD INSECURITY WAS WAS BROAD AND I AM AWARE HAVING WORKED WITH THE FOOD BANK IN IN SANTA CRUZ IN RECENT YEARS VERY CLOSELY. THAT AS HE SAID THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR GROUP. OF OAXACAN IMMIGRANTS MANY OF WHOM ARE NOT DOCUMENTED. THAT ARE AFRAID. TO DO ANYTHING IN PUBLIC IN THE FOOD BANK HAS FIGURED OUT WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE FOOD IN SECURITY IN THAT SO. THERE ARE EFFORTS THAT ARE MUCH BROADER THAN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING DONE AND- A. N. IN A SHAMELESS PLUG- THE THING THAT IT BECAUSE MY FIRST QUESTION IS GOING TO BE ALONG THE LINES OF. SENATOR JOE BOGGS WHICH IS WHAT THE DROP OFF IS BEEN. CUT DURING THE PANDEMIC OF PEOPLE UTILIZING IT AND HOW THAT IS FIT TO FUNDING. BECAUSE THE ONE PLACE THAT'S BEEN OFF THE CHARTS IS FOOD BANKS ARE AND THERE IS AN ASK IN SUB THREE. TO CONTINUE THE BOXED FOODS AND OTHER THINGS AND THE NATIONAL GUARD ASSISTANCE EXPIRES. IN A MATTER OF WEEKS AND THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS MADE IT HAPPEN IN SOME PLACES IN THE STATE SO. THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE DO HERE WILL HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED ON FOOD INSECURITY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THEY ARE BECAUSE THERE SHOULD NOT BE A FOOD CLIFF. OR A SERVICE. THAT FOOD BANKS GO OVER IN JUNE WHEN SCHOOLS AREN'T TOTALLY BACK. AND STILL MIGHT BE OFFERING AT A SUBNORMAL LEVELS OF PARTICIPATION. SO THAT WE ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE REACH KIDS AND FAMILIES UNTIL WE'RE AT A PLACE THAT. WE MIGHT RE OPEN AND BE IN A MORE EVEN LEVEL SO I JUST SORT OF WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. SO THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. WHAT THE SCHOOL NUTRITION ISSUES ARE AND HOW TO REACH PEOPLE FOR THAT WE KNOW THAT IT'S A LITTLE BROADER THAN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT SO. LET ME JUST START UP- AN CRIB IN PART FROM SENATOR OR CHOI BOGUE AND I DON'T KNOW WHO IS THE BEST. BUT TO ASK BUT I'M JUST WORKING EVERYBODY TALKED ABOUT. WHAT THE PROGRAM IS AND HOW IT WORKED OR NOT WORKED DURING THE PANDEMIC WHAT WHAT'S THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC BITTEN WHAT WHAT'S THE RATE OF PARTICIPATION. OF OUR STUDENTS IN GETTING THIRD THE TAKEOUT OR COMING TO THE SCHOOL AND PICKING UP MALES AS OPPOSED TO THE NORMAL LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION IS THERE ANYBODY THAT FEELS LIKE THEY CAN SPEAK TO THAT. CHAIR ALIGNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I'D BE HAPPY TO. TO JUMP IN A LITTLE THAT. YES ABSOLUTELY DON'T POSE. THANK YOU. I'M ASSUMING TWENTY NINETEEN THE USDA RELEASED A NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT TITLED SCHOOLS NUTRITION AND MEALS COST STUDY THE STUDY REPORTED THAT ON AVERAGE- ALL SCHOOLS REVENUES- FOR MEMBERS. EXCUSE ME REVENUES FROM REIMBURSABLE LUNCHES COVERED ONLY AN AVERAGE OF 93% REPORTED COSTS AND REVENUES FROM BREAKFAST COVERED 82% IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT A STARKLY ABOUT 40% OF OUR SCHOOLS PARTICIPATING IN THE FEDERAL MEALS PROGRAM ENCROACH ON THEIR DISTRICTS GENERAL FUND TO HELP SUPPORT THEIR FOOD SERVICE. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE PANDEMIC FURTHER STRESS THE PHYSICAL PHYSICAL HEALTH OF SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS BUT THE PROBLEM FOR US IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE OVERALL IMPACT WE THINK ABOUT A 30% DROP IN MEALS SERVED DURING THE PANDEMIC WHICH DIRECTLY IMPACTS THOSE REIMBURSEMENTS AND OF COURSE- AND INCREASED COSTS FOR PERSONNEL AND DIFFERENT EQUIPMENT WERE HUGE COSTS THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT HAPPENS FOR THE SCHOOL FISCAL HEALTH IN PROVIDING THESE MEALS AND IN THE ABILITY OF SCHOOLS TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE. SO DO YOU IN EFFECT NO THERE'S BEEN A 30% REDUCTION BECAUSE YOU'VE DEDUCED IT FROM A 30% DROP IN CLAIMS FOR MEALS IS THAT HOW YOU GOT TO THAT THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY IN. ARE WE NOT THINK. HE'S NORMALLY JUST A QUESTIONS AT THE POOL FOR LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO ADD TO THAT AND THEN I'M JUST GONNA GO TO CENTER. BOOK IS THERE ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO ADD TO THAT. SAYING NO ONE ARE WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS GO TO THE TWO SENATORS AND THEN ALL BACK CLEAN UP IF THERE IS. ANYTHING LEFT ALL DO THAT BUT CENTER GROVE JOB YOU STARTED TO GO INTO SOME OF THESE ISSUES- I'D RECOGNIZE YOU TO GO WHEREVER YOU WANT WITH QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED I WAS JUST- I I'M JUST A CURIOUS TO. TO SEE- CAN I HEAR WHAT THE PLAN WILL BE OR WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE PLANET. THAT YOU HAVE WITH REGARDS TO. MEETING THAT. THE NUMBERS. OF STUDENTS THAT NEED TO BE- COVERED AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN FINANCIALLY WITH THE RESOURCES OF THOSE THAT ARE NOT BEING UTILIZED- MAXIMIZED I'M JUST ANYTHING IF THERE'S WILL THERE BE POTENTIALLY ANY EXTRA FUNDING THAT HAPPENS FROM SCHOOLS OR STUDENTS NOT TAKING PART IN THE SERVICES OF THE OF THE MEALS OR- IF WE'RE NOT PURCHASING I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT DO YOU FOLKS PURCHASE THAT THE MEALS FOR EVERY SINGLE STUDENT AND THEN THERE UTILIZED OR NOT UTILIZED OR DO YOU. HOW DOES THAT WORK FINANCIALLY AND IS DIRECTING THE QUESTION AND I BELIEVE. THAT WOULD BE. TO SARAH CORTEZ OR EVEN PROBABLY- AT SEA. KIM FRENZAL. YES TEMPERANCE ALL DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- I CAN START THAT MAN SERAPHINE LIKE TO. I'M IN THE FEDERAL MAIL PROGRAMS OUR REIMBURSEMENT AND SERVICE FOR ACTUAL MEALS SERVED- AND SO IT REALLY OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS DEPEND ON THE STUDENT PARTICIPATION SO THAT THEY CAN SUBMIT THEIR MAIL CLAIMS IN THE REPAIRS TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THE ACTUAL MEALS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO THE STUDENTS SO WHEN WE SEE THE DROP AND REIMBURSEMENT SO THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WITHIN A 30% DROP. IN REIMBURSEMENTS THAT TELLS US THAT WHEN WE KNOW AND JENNIFER CAN ABSOLUTELY SPEAK OF THIS THAT- THEY HAVE THEY HAVE FIXED COSTS THAT CONTINUE AND WHEN THEY SEE THEIR MALE COUNTER MAIL CLAIMING GO DOWN THERE THEIR REVENUE IS GOING DOWN TO SUPPORT THEIR PRO. BUT JUST LET ME ASK QUICK FOLLOW UP BEFORE CENTER BROKEN AND YOU TALKED ABOUT FIX COSTS SO. REVENUES MIGHT GO DOWN THE PARTICIPATION MIGHT GO DOWN BUT THE FIXED COSTS ARE STEADY IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. YES AND I THINK WE WENT TO- IT AGAIN JENNIFER CAN REALLY TALK. REAL LIFE TO ALL OF THIS- BUT YOU'LL ALSO YOUNG THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WE SAW FOOD COSTS GO UP THE PACKAGING SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT. A STAFF SCHEDULES AND MAYBE NEED MORE STAFF TO COVER MORE POINTS TO SELL JUST TO KEEP EVERYBODY- HEALTHY AND SAFE AND SO THEY DID SEE. YOUR DIFFERENT COST AS WELL CHANGING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC. IN IN SENATOR ENOUGH I CAN ASK JUST A CLARIFYING QUESTION IS. ARE YOU ASKING IT YOU KNOW IN THE EVENT THAT WE DO ARE ABLE TO MOVE TOWARDS UNIVERSAL MEALS WELL WHEN IMPLEMENTATION LOOK LIKE. YES FOR THAT YES SO WE WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE UNIVERSAL ONE BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE SUPPORTING AT SUCH A MEASURE I GUESS I WAS. PREVIOUSLY NINE IN A PREVIOUS COMMITTEE. BUT AS WE SUPPORT PROGRAM SUCH AS AS THAT UNIVERSAL. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT- TRYING TO FIND SUCH A PROGRAM OF COURSE THE NUMBERS WILL VERY NOT EVERY AND AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER EARLIER NOT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT PARTICIPATES IN THAT AND I'M ASSUMING. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR THAT UNIVERSAL PART IN FEDERAL. YOU NEED TO HAVE EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT- PARTICIPATING SO MY CONCERNED OR NOT CONCERNED I. I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. HOW DO WE WERE THAT FINE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COVER THOSE COSTS IF FEDERAL EITHER GOING TO BE COMING IN AND SUPPLEMENTING THOSE EXTRA FIXED COSTS TO ACCOMMODATE. THE UNIVERSAL YOU PROGRAM OR IS THAT A STATE RESPONSIBILITY SO WILL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BE ABLE. TO SUPPLEMENT THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS COVERED IN ORDER TO PURSUE THAT ENDEAVOR OR IS THAT A RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE- IS THERE A POSSIBILITY IN THE FORMULA IN THE WAY THAT IT'S- STRUCTURED RIGHT NOW TO HAVE. EXTRA FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE AT THE END IS OUR POSSIBILITY FOR THAT WHICH I'M I'M ASSUMING BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAID THAT IT'S IN ARREARS YOU YOU BAIL BASED ON WHAT YOU YOU. YOU SERVE THAT WOULD NOT BE THE POSSIBILITY BUT AT THE STATE LEVEL IS THERE A POSSIBILITY TO HAVE EXTRA FUNDS AT THE VERY END. REGARDING YEAH. MATTER FOR ELLIE TO DATE. YOU CAN CERTAINLY TALK ABOUT MORE ABOUT LIKE HOW WE WORK THE OPERATIONS ON A DAILY BASIS. BUT I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE THE ACTUAL FUNDING ASPECT OF IT AND HOW WE WOULD IMPLEMENT THIS ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL IT'S BETTER FOR OUR LEAD TO M. OR SCARED TO TAKE THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU JENNIFER. GARNER WITH THE STATE FOR THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. IT REFER TO SOME OR SOME OF THE EARLIER COMMENTS THAT WE NEED WE BELIEVE THAT TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL STUDENTS RECEIVE THESE MEALS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE CALIFORNIA AT THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSAL MEAL PROGRAM REQUIRE ALL SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE- BECAUSE THERE IS THAT. THERE IS AN INCREASE REIMBURSEMENTS FOR ALL SCHOOLS THE STATE MEAL REIMBURSEMENT IS TWENTY FOUR CENTS WHILE THE MEAL FOR A FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR A FREE MEAL IS THREE DOLLARS AND SIXTY CENTS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD INCENTIVIZE FOR SCHOOLS THAT DON'T. CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE- THERE BECAUSE THEY DO STILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THOSE MEALS. IN ADDITION IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE NEED TO DRAW DOWN THE FEDERAL FUNDS FIRST AND THEN SUPPLEMENT WITH STATE DOLLARS RATHER THAN SUPPLANTING WITH STATE DOLLARS TO PULLING DOWN THE FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR ALL ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. WHAT AT WOULD MITIGATE HOW MUCH THE COST TO THE STATE. GENERAL FUND WITH A- SO- IT ELLIE RIGHT ELLIE. YES DALY YES SORRY EIGHT SERVICE SIMILAR HEAD OF CRISTINA GO HEAD GO OF JUST SO QUICKLY I GOT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CALL. SO I APPRECIATE THAT THAT STATEMENT- ON THAT WHAT WOULD BE THE REASON FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOT TO WANT TO PARTICIPATE MOVING FORWARD. IT'S A PAPERWORK BATTLE A LOT OF TIMES FOR SCHOOLS THAT DON'T HAVE A HIGH LOW INCOME LOW INCOME POPULATION THE PAPER WORK TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN CAN BE DIFFICULT AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE DO NEED TO INCENTIVIZE THIS- LET ME GRAB MY NOTES REALLY QUICKLY BECAUSE I HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I COVER EVERYTHING- AS I MENTIONED THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED SOMETHING. PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT DON'T PARTICIPATE IN THE CURRENT FEDERAL SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS IT'S BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE COMMUNITIES WITH LOW POPULATIONS HAVEFREE AND REDUCED MEALS- ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AND THE L. A. PREFERS TO COVER THE COST OF THE CALIFORNIA STEEL THIS IS STATE MEAL MANDATE FOR NEEDY STUDENTS THEMSELVES. SOME SCHOOLS DO SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN OF OPERATING FEDERAL THE FEDERAL PROGRAM IS NOT WORTH THE LITTLE REIMBURSEMENT THAT THEY RECEIVE CURRENTLY SOME USE NON FEDERAL FUNDS TO PROVIDE MEALS TO NEEDY STUDENTS AND SOME PARTNER WITH NEIGHBORING SCHOOL DISTRICTS PROVIDE MEALS. BUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE. IS TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS A SECOND LAYER OF CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC LAWS THAT MAKE PROGRAM OPERATION DIFFICULT. AND THEY CAN BE SUBJECT TO SOME PROGRAM INTEGRITY CONTROLS. THIS WOULD BE DIFFERENT UNDER A UNIVERSAL MEALS PROGRAM AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE STATE. ON THAT WOULD SPLIT THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO BARRIERS SO UNIVERSAL STATE. WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE IT EASIER FOR THESE FIVE HUNDRED AND PLUS SCHOOLS. DO YOU HAVE A LESS ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND THEREFORE BE MORE INCENTIVIZED TO BE PARTICIPANTS. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WOULD NECESSARILY DECREASE THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN BUT WHAT IT WOULD DO IS INCREASE THE REIMBURSEMENT THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR RIGHT NOW IF THEY'RE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE NATIONAL PROGRAM THE ONLY GET TWENTY FOUR CENTS- FROM THE STATE. FOR THESE FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS IF THEY'RE PARTICIPATING THEY'RE GETTING THREE DOLLARS AND SIXTY CENTS FOR THOSE NEEDY STUDENT MEALS THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING. SO THAT WOULD BE AN INCENTIVE. YES YEAH OKAY ALL RIGHT PERFECT THANK YOU. NOT COMPLETE YOUR QUESTIONS SEND GOVERNMENT. YEAH I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT LINE OF QUESTIONING JUST A LITTLE BIT- I GUESS I'VE HEARD THAT THE CONTENT OF THE MEALS IS A FACTOR IN INCREASING TAKE UP FROM STUDENTS AND THEN- THE PAPERWORK AND REDUCING PAPERWORK IS A FACTOR IN. GETTING SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE WHAT OTHER. OBSTACLES COULD TAKE UP AND PARTICIPATION BOTH BY ELEAZAR SCHOOLS AND BY STUDENTS. DO ANY OF OUR PANELISTS SEE THAT WE COULD BE ADDRESSING. DID YOU DRESS THAT IS. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT IS ADEQUATE TIME TO EAT AND REALLY- I THINK MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE THOSE FRESH MEALS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALSO ADDRESSING WITHIN THIS BILL AS WELL. AT. SURE THAT WE HAVE TRAINING FOR OUR STAFF AND I THINK IF WE'RE AND DOING ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER WITH THIS BILL WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. ANY OTHER. WITNESSES HAVE ANYTHING THAT. OKAY- I'M OF ON MY NEXT QUESTION AND- I THINK YOU ALL SPOKE TO THE SUMMER DROP OFF BEING 30% AND I WOULD JUST ECHO A POINT THE CHEERLEADER MADE- WHEN I'VE BEEN OUT OF MY DISTRICT AT DIFFERENT TO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS- WE HAVE SEEN JUST LINES AND LINES OF CARS SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT 30% DROP OFF JUST BASED ON THE NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT STOP TAKING IS PROBABLY LOW BALLING IT. MY EXPERIENCE AND I THINK OTHER SENATORS HAVE SEEN THIS AS WELL IN THEIR DISTRICTS- IS THAT PROBABLY THE COVE IT IMPACTS ON OUR ECONOMY HAVE REALLY DRIVEN UP DRAMATICALLY THAT THE NEED FOR FOOD AND THE AMOUNT OF FOOD INSECURITY- BY I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THIS IF WE DO A RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN THE FALLS I THINK WE'RE ALL EXPECTING- WHAT. WILL HAPPEN IS IF WE SEE A MASSIVE SEARCH- AS IT MIGHT BE THE CASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF REDUCED PRICE OR FREE LUNCHES- COULD IT BE THE CASE THAT FIXED COSTS COULD GO UP IF WE SEE A DRAMATIC RISE IN. DEMAND AND I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION. FOR ALLEY GARNER. YOU SENATE. IN THE CASE. THIS HAS. WE THAT WE HAVE BEEN WITH. AT PROJECTED BECAUSE WITHIN. OF TWENTY PER PER TO. SO THAT IS PART OF THE CALCULATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING. IN PRIDE. TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME COST. ANALYSIS FOR THIS THIS PROGRAM WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN PARTICIPATION. AND SO WERE FACTORING IN A 20% PARTICIPATION INCREASED INTO COST ANALYSIS 20% OVER THE BASELINE THAT WE SAW PRETENDING TO. YES SIR OKAY GOT IT- AND THEN I GUESS YOU KNOW THIS IS MAYBE MORE BASIC QUESTION BUT- YOU KNOW IF WE DO RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WHAT DO WE HAVE PLANS FOR A LITTLE BIT PROTOCOLS AROUND FOOD PREPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION I ASSUME WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO. RETURN THE HOT MEALS IN. THERE IS THAT GONNA BE LEFT UP TO LOCAL CONTROLLERS THAT SOMETHING IN YOUR VIEW. THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE APARTMENT EDUCATION SHOULD WEIGH IN ON I GUESS THAT'S A QUESTION FOR. EITHER MISTER CHAIN OR MISS LAVAR. OR ANYONE ELSE WHO HAS AN OPINION ON THIS. I'M I THINK WE'RE PLANNING ON DOING IN IN SAN FRANCISCO TO RETURN TO HOT MEALS AND WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING IT RIGHT NOW I THINK THE QUESTION IS GOING TO BE WHAT MODALITY WE'RE GOING TO BE STIRRING THOSE MEALS WILL IT BE I AM IN OUR- CONTINUING WITH MEALS IN THE CLASSROOM- AND DELEM. LEVEL OR GRABBING GOES SERVICE AT THE CENTER LEVEL OR WILL WE BE ABLE TO RETURN TO THE CAFETERIA SERVICE I THINK THAT'S A REALLY QUESTION THAT WE HAVE TO ANSWER BUT I THINK THAT WILL BE BASED ON THAT REALLY THAT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THE INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND WHAT THEY WILL BE DOING I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE THE LOCAL QUESTION HAS TO BE ANSWERED. AND I GUESS ABOUT HER OF THE QUESTION IS JUST A- SECOND QUESTION WHICH IS IT WILL WE SEE A- RISE. KERR BE ON THE NEED FOR COVERED FOR. IN PARTICLES. I THINK WE WERE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT RISING. AND BASED ON P. P. E. REQUIRE. AT THE- GARFIELD DEBORAH AND- I MEAN WHERE WE'RE TO CAN TO SEE THE RAISING COSTS. YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE OF THE PARTICULAR SHE WE SEEN THAT COSTS AND TROUBLE FOR US- CAN'T REMEMBER. OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. BUT CONTINUE READING- PROVIDE NOW. I THOSE ARE UNDING IF WE- CONTINUE TO HAVE. IN THE DISTRICT IS. TO BE FOR THAT I DON'T. I'M AS TO I HAVING THAT FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL USING OUR REMEMBER. THAT WILL HELP RAISE SOME IS BUT THAT ALL TO BE. THAT AND I KNOW FOR US THIS TIME. OUR TERM AS ITS PUBLIC ORDERS ALLOW MANY- THE BANKS WOULD- HAVE- MOBILE PANTRIES THAT WOULD ROLL OUT TO TWO SCHOOLS HAVING MORE OF A OF FARMERS MARKET CHOICE. BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE- YOU KNOW THAT THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THE CONDITIONS ARE SAFE MISSION FOOD SAFETY AS WELL AS TV AND OTHER PROTECTIONS- BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE- THE DOWN THE ROAD VISION- AND BREAK WE SHOULD THE PARTNERSHIPS. WITH WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THE GREAT THING YOU. AND IF I CAN AND ONE OTHER THING SO MANY MEN JUST LEARNING AND IF WE DO CONTINUE WITH IS OUR WHAT THAT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT WE CONTINUE TO NEED TO DO GROUND GO FOR THIS YEAR THAT ARE. I AM STAYING DISTANCE SO THAT ANOTHER SERVICE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE YES ARE JUST SINCE AND SCHOOLS AS LIGHT SAN FRANCISCO OR ELSE DOING YOUR TO DOOR TO PROGRAMS FOR THOSE FAMILIES ARE ANY TO. OUR RAM PROBE SO WILL WE CONTINUE TO HAVE TO GO JULY SIR ON TOP OF THATIS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE SIGNED THE BURKE SO HOW DO WE WILL WE HOW WILL WE FOR THAT THAT'S ANOTHER LAYER THAT COMPLEX AS WELL. LET ME JUST. BEFORE I ASK MY- QUESTION I APPRECIATE THAT TO. INTO SHOULD NOT MISS FREE THE CALM. OF MAY. OR I. WHICH IS THE WE OVER WHY. X. BILL TO RETURN IN THE- BUT THERE WOULD BE OF. IN THE BE SOME MALT AND I SAW. THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE BIG NON. BUT DURING THAT YOU CALL IT THAT BECAUSE WILL HAVE TALK THAT WOULD WE GET IT IF THERE ARE. THE CAN FOR ISSUES SMALL PERCENT THAT. AFFECT THEMSELVES OF THAT. LET ME JUST SAY THAT THEIR WORK. IN THE AGENDA PACKET IN I THINK- IN THE OPENING STATEMENT IN THE- FOR. SENATORS BUT CHAU BOCA MEN THOSE OF REALLY BEEN A DRY WELL THE THING I LIKE JUST. TALK ABOUT FOR A BRIEF SECOND A AS THE I. IS THE SENATE. CAUCUS BECAUSE- FOR THE ON AND- IN A FEW PLACES DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS AND SAID WE HAVE. ONE TIME MONEY OR NEW ON GOING MONEY AND LET'S BUDGET FOR IMPACT FORECOURTS TRIED TO ACTUALLY TAKE CERTAIN ISSUES AND REALLY TRY TO ADDRESSED AND SO HOMELESSNESS IS ONE STUDENT NAY DIDN'T HIGHER EDUCATION IS ANOTHER. BUT ANOTHER IS THE ONE THAT FALLS INTO THE PURVIEW OF THE HEARING TODAY. WHICH IS SCHOOL NUTRITION AS A TOP PRIORITY- INCLUDING PROGRESS ON UNIVERSAL MEALS AND MAXIMIZING FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS AND BUILDING OFF THE WAIVERS WHICH MS GARNER COMMENTED ON TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT REDUCING CHILD HUNGER DURING HOLIDAY BREAKS AND SUMMER BREAKS WHICH SOME OF OUR- OUR PANELISTS BURKE COMMENTED ON. REDUCING OR ELIMINATING SCHOOL MEAL DEBT FOR ELLIE AS WHICH WAS TALKED ABOUT. A ALSO INCREASING THE NEW TO CONTENT OF MEALS AND LOCAL GROWN IN SCHOOL LUNCHES THAT WAS ADDRESSED AND THEN STABILIZING AND SUPPORTING THE CLASSIFIED STAFF. TO PROVIDE FOOD SERVICE AT SCHOOLS AND MISS ORTIZ COMMENTS AND SUNGROW CHAU BOOKS QUESTIONS GOT IT THAT SO I WOULD JUST ASK GLOBALLY. IF YOU WORK FOR. OUR IF WE WERE AS A STATE TO MOVE TO UNIVERSAL MALES AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT THAT I JUST LISTED WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE BARRIERS IF WE MAKE A COMMITMENT. AND PUT FINANCING BEHIND IT WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS IN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING IT TO AND GETTING TO A POINT THAT THAT WE HAVE UNIVERSAL NIELSEN MAYBE I'LL START WITH ELLIE GARNER AND THEN TAKE ANYBODY ELSE THAT WISHES TO RESPOND. AT THE HALF THE QUESTION. WELL IT IS A HAVE GOAL. ASSEMBLY IN. I THINK THAT I'M I WANT TO YOU CAN OUT ON OF THE CALL BUT I THINK THE WE- I'D LIKE TO READ THAT THE S. P. IN THE APART ADVENTURE REALLY DO SUPPORT THE- OF THE DEMOCRATIC IN UNIVERSE ACCESS TO HEALTHY AND NUTRITIOUS MEALS BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ARE UNIVERSAL MEAL PROGRAM BE FIX FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE AND THAT WE MAXIMIZE ALL FEDERAL MEAL REIMBURSEMENT OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE SUPPLEMENTING WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDS SO I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT IN THE STRUCTURE THAT WE BUILD FOR THIS PROGRAM. WE ENSURE THAT WERE ACCESSING AND UTILIZING FEDERAL FUNDS TO THE MAXIMUM CAPACITY AND SUPPLEMENTING ON A STATE LEVEL- WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH SENATOR SKINNER ON THIS BILL BOTH ON A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PLEASE AND AT THE S. S. P. I. IS SPONSORING THE BILL SO I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE IN A GOOD PLACE- BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT REQUIRING ALL SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FEDERAL SCHOOL NUTRITION MEAL PROGRAMS AND AS SENATOR AND SHE'LL TELL ABOUT WHAT DID MENTION THERE ARE SOME BARRIERS AND SOME SCHOOLS HAVE NOT WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM. BUT REQUIRING THAT PARTICIPATION WILL ENSURE THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT- AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE COST ON TO THE STATE CAN IS THERE ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO HAVE FOR YOU GO BECAUSE I THINK IT DID A GOOD JOB OF ANSWERING THE QUESTION- LET ME JUST EMPHASIZE THAT ONE OF THE PIECES OF THIS IS MAXIMIZING THE FEDERAL REPAYMENT REIMBURSEMENTS AND BUILDING OFF THE WAIVERS AND SO THE QUESTION IS SINCE WE- WANT TO MAKE THAT A PIECE OF THIS IS THERE AN IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEM WITH FACT BECAUSE I THINK YOU EXPRESSED THE CONCERN THAT WE ACTUALLY DO IT WHO. IF WE DO MOVE TO UNIVERSAL WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT IT THE STAFF REYES AND IMPLEMENTATION. PROBLEM WE DON'T FORESEE EMBLEM. PROBLEM THAT IT WILL HAVE TO BE A ROCK. ON SCHOOL AND I'M GONNA DEFERRED A CAMERA THIS BUT- THERE DC ANY I JUST CASES I'VE MISSED CAMP NOW I YOU DID IF. JOB AND WE KNOW THE ISSUE. THE FOOD TO OF- I WENT JUST KIDDING I'M JUST KIDDING. I THINK HE IS A FABULOUS. THANK WELL THE ENGINE THE FED WAIVER ARE WILL LOOKS- THE TO DO FEDERAL WAY FOR SCHOOLS. THE UNIVERSE MEALS THINKING BACK TO THE WAY. EXPIRE AND GO THE ANTI SCHOOL SCHOOL COMING UP SO WE OUR PROPOSED OF UNITS ME THAT WOULD START IN- TWENTY TWENTY. IT'S COMMON ALLY. AND IS ALLEY- TO THE ONLY ONE MAXIMIZE THE THAT THE FUND. AND ALSO A LINE THREE. I MEAN THERE ARE GOOD HEALTH. AND YOU STANDARDS IN THE FEDERAL MEAL PROGRAMS THERE'S- YOU KNOW TRAINING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND SO THE BARRIER THAT I WOULD SEE IT IS JUST IS JUST LOOKING UP THE PROGRAM AND YES YOU KNOW WILL NEED SOME MORE STAFFING WILL HAVE MORE SCHOOLS COMING ON TO THE PROGRAM. BUT WE'RE READY AND REALLY EXCITED TO REALLY LOOK TO SEE HOW HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN. GREAT TO KNOW IF WE ENACTED WE WOULD WANT TO WORK TOGETHER ON EXACTLY. OF THOSE THINGS AND I SHOULD ALSO SORT OF EMPHASIZE THERE'S A PROCESS NUANCE HERE WE ARE NOT HEARING THAT BILL BUT IF THAT BILL. PASSES OR SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS- WILL WITH THE FRAME OF BUDGET TO M. IT SO I THINK THAT THE AND- TO THING. UP BEFORE LEAVE THE STOP IS- ANY THING ANY ELSE TO ADD. TO THEN BY SAYING NO ONE LET ME THANK OUR PANELISTS OF THIS WAS A GREAT DISCUSSION IT WAS REALLY HELPFUL. AND I THINK PEOPLE WERE VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA AND THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE MEMBER SEN. LET'S JUST SAY TAT THE AMOUNT OF TIME WE SPEND ON THIS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO HOW IMPORTANT WE THINK IT IS AND HOW WE WILL WANT TO WORK. TOGETHER ON WHATEVER COMES OUT OF THE BUDGET TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT IMPLEMENTED IN A GOOD WAY SO THANK YOU AGAIN WE APPRECIATE. AND WE REMOVED ISSUE NUMBER TWO STATEWIDE STUDENT ASSESSMENTS WE HAVE THREE PANELISTS MICHELLE BALL VALVE DVF FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ONLY GARNERED AGAIN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND BROOKS ALLEN TO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION WILL GO IN THAT ORDER AND WILL BEGIN WITH MICHELLE FAULTY VIA.

BE ABLE TO BE DISAGGREGATED BY STUDENT GROUPS. OUR A BE HAPPY NOW ANY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS TO ALL THREE PANELISTS AND I'M GONNA BEGIN. WITH QUESTIONS AND MAYBE WE'LL STICK WITH MR ALLEN AND DON'T LET OTHER PEOPLE. RESPOND BUT WHAT I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. OF FIVE READ. BASICALLY A SUMMARY OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID ANYWAY. AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT FITS TIME WISE- WHAT THE FLIES THAT YOU'VE ALREADY DECIDED TO THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR. IN AND IF IT DOES THAT MEAN THAT WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED APPLIES COMPLETELY THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR WILL YOU BE REVISITING IT AT SOME POINT TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT. YOU UPDATED PARTICULARLY IF STUDENTS ARE COMING BACK. IN OVERWHELMING NUMBERS FOR IN PERSON EDUCATION. YEAH RIGHT NOW ALL OF THE DECISIONS THAT I JUST OUTLINED APPLY TO THIS CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR AND FAR SPRINGS ABSENT WINDOW. REALLY NOTABLY BY EXTENDING THE TESTING WINDOW TO THE END OF JULY THAT'S REALLY THE MOST APPLICABLE LONGER TERM DECISIONS BEEN MADE AT THIS POINT OTHERWISE ALL DECISIONS ARE APPLICABLE JUST TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR AND THAT TO YOUR POINT WILL BE REVISITED FOR NEXT YEAR DEPENDING ON THE CONDITIONS WE FACE. OKAY AND THEN ARE PREVENT ME ASKED THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- MICHELLE EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ALREADY. I ASSUME THAT THAT THE MAY REVISE WILL ADDRESS THIS IN SOME WAY BUT TO TURN NOT. PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT OR DID ANYONE. YEAH I THINK- I THINK YESTERDAY EXACTLY- WE ARE LOOKING AT- REVISIONS YOU KNOW FOR THE MAY REVISED BUT WE CAN'T REALLY SPEAK. AT THIS TIME. OKAY BECAUSE IT. IT EVEN THOUGH I APPRECIATE THAT THAT WOULD REALLY HELP US OUT- TRYING TO CONTEMPLATE NEXT YEAR THE N. N. A. N. IT IS ALWAYS A BIT OF A CHICKEN AND THE EGG BECAUSE THE STATE ALL. OF OUR BOARD OF EDUCATION HAS TO DO WHAT THEY REQUIRE IN THE BUDGET HAS TO FOLLOW AND- EVERY SO OFTEN THE BUDGET LEADS AND- STATE BOARD FOLLOWS AND SO I THINK THAT'S JUST WHERE. ARE YOU WE WILL HAVE AN INTEREST AND OBVIOUSLY BY THE TIME WE MAKE A DECISION ON THIS THE MAY REVISE WILL BE AND THEN AND WE WILL REFLECT ON. ON WHATEVER'S. IN IT TO DO WHAT. I WAS GOING TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION- BECAUSE IT WAS JUST DISCUSS. WITH THE STATE BOARD. WHAT HAPPENS THE WORK HAS HAPPENED FOR THE SPRING. AND FALL ARE THEY'RE EXPECTED TO BE SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS OVER WHAT WAS BUDGETED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BASED ON THE DECISIONS THAT WERE JUST. MADE FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SPRING. AND I THINK FINDING A JUST WITH THE WHICH- ASSEMBLY GET IN WITH A PERMANENT FINANCE AND WE DO PLAN TO ACCOUNT FOR SAVINGS FROM- SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY SO THIS CURRENT- TESTING CYCLE AS PART OF THE NEW REVISED AND AGAIN- ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ONCE THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED- YEAH THAT'S REALLY ALL WE CAN SAY AT THIS TIME. OKAY BUT- THAT DID POINT US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WHILE STILL OFFICIALLY. AND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FEELS BEING CRYPTIC SO FAR. YES L. A. GARNER ON THE OTHER THE SUPERINTENDENT IF I MAY ASK I WOULD AGREE THAT IT'S TOO EARLY- AT THIS POINT IN TIME TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT THAT'S STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT SAVING MIGHT BE IT'S ALSO- TOO EARLY TO CONFIRM THE NUMBER OF TEST TAKERS IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CAST GIVEN THE EXTENSION OF THE STATEWIDE TESTING WINDOW. SO THAT IS ANOTHER- VARIABLE THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED IN IDENTIFYING THE SAVINGS THAT MIGHT BE ACTUALLY A PART OF THE PROCESS AND ALSO FOR THE L. PACK ALL ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE REQUIRED TO BE TESTED AND IT IS NOT BAD AT THAT THERE WILL BE ANY SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS FROM THE OUTBACK. AND JUST EIGHTY VENDO- THIS WAS SPOKEN TO IN A WIFE WANTED TO JUST CONTINUE OUR COMMENTS AND SAY WHY. CERTAINLY SO- WE'RE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SAVINGS BOTH FROM THE SPRING ADMINISTRATION OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THIS IS A AND THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT THE TESTING WAS POSITIVE IN EARLY EARLY MARCH BUT THE PROCESS STILL CONTINUES ON. HOW TO UPDATE THOSE EXAMS AND PROVIDE THEM IN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. AND BOB CONTINUE FOR US TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE THOSE AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS AND- THE SAVINGS IS NOT AS SIGNIFICANT AS ONE MIGHT ANTICIPATE. OKAY THANK YOU- THIS WOULD BE THE TIME FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM MANY MEMBERS- CENTER ULTRABOOK ANY QUESTIONS. FOR A CENTER BERMAN YEAH- THANK YOU- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THERE ARE SOME IN THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT FEEL LIKE. ASSESSMENTS HAVE LIMITED VALUE- WE KIND OF HAD A MASS EXPERIMENT- IN REDUCING THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF THESE ASSESSMENTS. I DO WE HAVE ANY DATA ACK YET THAT MIGHT SUGGEST- WHETHER THESE ARE AS EFFECTIVE AS THE TRADITIONAL ASSESSMENTS- WITH A FEWER HOURS PER STUDENT VIEW ACROSS THE STATE. I'M SORRY SENATOR CAN BE CUTE X. EXPLAINED THE QUESTION A LITTLE BIT MORE YEAH AND THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE FASTER MR ALLEN BUT- YOU KNOW WE BASICALLY HAD YOU KNOW A YEAR WHERE WE'VE BEEN RELY AND I REALIZE THAT THE DATA IS NOT ALL IN BECAUSE HE'S JUST MENTIONED. NOT ALL STUDENTS HAVE TAKEN THE TEST THE TESTING WINDOW STILL OPEN BUT I DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHETHER THE REDUCE TESTING IS AS EFFECTIVE IN ASSESSING STUDENTS. ARE ES THE TRADITIONAL ASSESSMENTS. BEFORE I DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE AT THE STATE BOARD WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATA YET- TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT THE SHORTENED FORM THAT WAS. ADOPTED WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND SO. WE CAN DO COMPARISON ONCE WE HAVE THE DATA BUT AGAIN BECAUSE THE WINDOW IS EXTENDED AND WE HAVE A LONGER TIME PERIOD WE'RE GOING TO BE. A LITTLE BIT BEHIND ON BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY DATA WE WILL BE CONDUCTING ANALYSIS BUT ARE JUST NOT READY TO ANSWER AT THIS POINT IN TIME. I APPRECIATE THAT AND- I GUESS THE- BROADER POINT IS IF THIS IS. SOMETHING THAT WE DO SEE IS AN EFFECTIVE PROXY IS THERE SOME POSSIBILITY TO. YOU KNOW. MAKE THIS A PERMANENT CHANGE AS OPPOSED TO JUST A TEMPORARY COVERT NINETEEN DRIVEN. CHANGE CITY CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING YOU THAT ANALYSIS ONCE WE HAVE THE DATA DATA BACK- I WOULD DEFER TO THE- TO THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. ON NEXT STEPS AS FAR AS CHANGING ASSESSMENT. THANK YOU. NONE MISTER ALAN ANYTHING TO ADD ON. YES SAID I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THIS IS EXACTLY THE QUESTION THAT CAME UP BEFORE THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTEMPLATE WHEN THERE WAS THE MOVE MADE TO THE SHORT FORM ASSESSMENTS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH WHICH I BELIEVE IS WHERE QUESTIONS FOCUSED- YOU CAN MAKE THAT WILL LOOK IF WE CAN DO IT LAST TIME RIGHT LIKE TAT THAT SEEMS TO BE A GOOD THING BECAUSE WE KNOW ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT COMES UP IS THE MOUNTAIN STRUCTURAL TIMES TAKEN PROCESS AND- I WILL BEFORE I THINK OF BOTH IS GONNA HAVE OF COLLEAGUES WHO ARE MUCH DEEPER- INTO PSYCHOMETRIC PARTS OF THE OF THE ASSESSMENTS TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS. THERE ARE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IN TERMS OF MOBILITY AROUND THE CLAIMS THAT CAN BE MADE AND AT WHAT LEVEL- ONCE YOU GO TO A SHORTENED FORM ASSESSMENT. OR AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS ARE VERSUS WHAT CAN BE DONE- OBVIOUSLY ACROSS MORE AGGREGATE LEVEL AND SO YOU DO LOSE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT- BUT TO THE DETAIL OF THAT- I'M LIKE A BIRD I THERE'S A COUPLE ARE CALLING SO I KNOW ARE ARE AVAILABLE NOW OR ABILITY. TO REPORT BACK AS MISS BERNARD SUGGESTED. I DON'T SEE ANYBODY ELSE- BRUSHING TO COMMENT HOW DOES THAT COMPLETE YOUR QUESTION SENATOR THEN LET ME THANK YOU ALL- ON PANEL TWO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND WE ARE WAITING WITH BATED BREATH FOR THE MAY REVISE AND THEN WE WILL DECIDE WHERE WE GO- BUT WE- APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US TODAY. SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE THREE STATE OPERATIONS. APOLLO FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EMILY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND NOW WE GARNER FROM THE- DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU CHAIR GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HEALTH MINISTER TANG WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF AND PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STATE OPERATIONS BUDGET. HUNDREDS BUDGET PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED TEN MILLION IN STATE OPERATIONS SUPPORT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. WE A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION IS PROVIDED TO SUPPORT APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TEN AUTHORIZED POSITIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HEADQUARTERS. THIS IS NOT FOR THE HEADQUARTERS CONSISTS OF EIGHTY MILLION NOT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO MILLION FEDERAL FUNDS AND FORTY MILLION OTHER FANS. ADDITIONALLY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION SUPPORTS APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY POSITIONS AT THE STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS. THIS AMOUNT CONSISTS OF SIXTY SEVEN MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL PLAN WHAT SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND AND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND OTHER FAT. I'M NOW MOVE ON TO THE BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS AS OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES. ONE MILLION ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDS FOR A ONE YEAR EXTENSION OF THE SACKS ENTERED ICE CODE STRUCTURE REPLACEMENT PROJECTS. FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT PROJECT CAL STOP WHICH STANDS FOR STUDENTS TEACHERS AND OFFICERS PREVENTING VIOLENCE. ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND ONGOING FEDERAL FUNDS AND ONE POSITION TO FULFILL NEW DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS% RELATED TO THE FEDERAL EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT. THE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND I'M NOT ON THE AGENDA NOTES THE ORIGINAL REQUEST. NEXT TWELVE POINT SIX MILLION ONGOING NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO BANKROLL CHILD CARE NUTRITION PROGRAMS POSITIONS SHIFTING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THERE'S ALSO TWO HUNDRED SIX THOUSAND ONE TIME NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT ACTIVITIES CONSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION. AND FINALLY ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND ONGOING NOT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. POSITION TO SUPPORT THE SCHOOL EMERGENCY REPORTING SYSTEM. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE TO THE LA L. GOOD MORNING SENATORS AMY LEE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE CITY-STATE'S OPERATIONS REQUEST CAN BE FOUND UNDER ISSUE THREE OF TODAY'S AGENDA. AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE TABLE AND THE AGENDA WE BELIEVE MOST OF THE REQUESTS ARE REASONABLE AND WOULD HELP CD EVEN MEET NEW AND EXISTING RESPONSIBILITIES. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE SEAT REQUEST WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION BEING THE REQUEST TO BACK FILL EIGHTY THREE POSITIONS THAT ARE SHIFTING TO DSS AS PART OF THAT TRANSITION APPROVED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. THIS REQUEST WOULD ALLOW SEAT TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE STATE PRESCHOOL AND CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS REMAINING AT CITY AFTER TRANSITIONING TO THE CHILD CARE PROGRAM CDSS. HOWEVER BECAUSE STAFFING LEVELS WILL BE DEPENDENT ON OTHER DECISIONS WE RECOMMEND CONFORMING STAFFING LEVELS AFTER THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE OTHER DECISIONS RELATED TO THE TRANSITION. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY. AND THEN REMOVED EARLY GUARD. THANK HONOR ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION I WOULD START WITH THE THANK YOU'S THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR COLLABORATION AS WE HAVE WORKED YOUR SEATS RESOURCE NEEDS WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT WORK ON OUTSTANDING ITEMS AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE TO THE BUDGET PROCESS. I WILL MANY OF CD'S BCPS AND THE OPERATIONS REQUESTS ARE IN LINE WITH- TYPICALLY COME BEFORE YOU AND WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE MAJOR PIECE AND THE CDC OPERATIONS REQUEST INVOLVES ENSURING CDP HAS ENOUGH STAFF THE CAN YOU CONTINUE OPERATING THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. AND THE SCHOOL CHILD MCNEIL PROGRAMS AFTER THE TRANSITION OF THE OF CHILD CARE AND CHILD ADULT CARE FOOD PROGRAM TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ON JULY THE FIRST. OVER THE LAST YEAR'S THE EASEMENT COORDINATING WITH CDSS DETERMINE HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THE TRANSITION WHILE MINIMIZING DISRUPTION TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ONCE THE TRANSITION IS IMPLEMENTED CD WILL NEED SIGNIFICANT STAFF RESOURCES TO CONTINUE THE CURRENT EVEN MODIFIED SUPPORTS THE COUNTRY CONTRACTORS AS WELL AS THIRTEEN STAFF AND OUR NUTRITION SERVICES DIVISION ONCE WE NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO SOME OF THE FEDERAL STATE ADMINISTRATION FUNDS. WHILE MANY PROGRAMS WILL BE TRANSITIONING TRANSPACIFIC WHILE MANY PROGRAMS WILL BE TRANSITIONING TO CDSS ALONG WITH OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY STAFF AND RELATED FUNDING. WE WOULDN'T CALL THIS A LIFT AND SHIFT AS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK WILL STILL REMAIN AT CD. CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL AND ALL OF THE CHILD MEAL NUTRITION PROGRAMS PREVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED CONCURRENTLY WITH STAFF WORKING ACROSS PROGRAM TYPES TO MONITOR AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE CITY IS NOT FUNDED ON A PER PROGRAM BASIS BUT INSTEAD LEVERAGES STAFFING ACROSS MULTIPLE PROGRAMS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND STATE OPERATIONS EFFICIENCIES. AFTER THE TRANSITIONS MANY FUNCTIONS WILL BE DUPLICATED AT BOTH DEPARTMENTS AND CD ONE THE RESOURCES TO REPLACE SOME OF THE FUNDING BEING THAT THE CDSS. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE RESOURCES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO CD IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CD CONTINUES TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO ENSURE THAT SUFFICIENT RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED SENATE SEAT CAN CONTINUE THE WORK THAT'S BEEN. AND THAT IS REQUIRED TO DO FOR THE REMAINING PRESCHOOL IN THE- PROGRAM THAT LEARNING AT SEA. I AND MY COLLEAGUES ARE NOT MORGAN LEAST IN THE HERE TO ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT THREE. REGARDING BCPS AND THE UPCOMING TRANSITIONS. OF CITIES PROGRAMS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT COMPLETES THE- THE PANEL PRESENTATIONS AND EVERYBODY SEEMED TO- ADDRESSED THE SUGGESTED QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA BUT- LET ME JUST ASK ONE VOTE CABALLERO. COMMENTED ON. AN ISSUE WITH THE BACKFILL OF EIGHTY POSITIONS AND I WONDERED IF. EITHER FINANCE OR CD HE WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT. LISTENING OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I CAN START OFF SO THE FACTUAL  JUST WANT TO CLARIFY- OF THE EIGHTY THREE POSITIONS FIFTY THREE OUR EXISTING POSITIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT. OF EDUCATION- THESE THESE ARE POSITIONS THAT I WILL NO LONGER BE FUNDED DUE TO THE SHIFT OF THE CHILD AND ADULT CARE FOOD PROGRAM OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO DRAW DOWN ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS- FOR THE CCF PETER SQUARE OTHER NUTRITION PROGRAMS. AND NOW THAT THE CA CFP IS SHIFTING THEY NO LONGER HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS SO- YOU KNOW THESE ARE FOR. YOUR POSITIONS ARE SUPPORTING OTHER NUTRITION PROGRAMS THAT ARE STAYING AT CD. SELL A BOOK FUNDING IS TO BACK FILLING THOSE FIFTY THREE EXISTING POSITIONS THAT ARE- STAYING AT THE DEPARTMENT. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR COMMENT A ET IS IT THAT. THE PROGRAM SHIFTING AWAY AND THE MONEY IS SHIFTING AWAY BUT YOU BELIEVE THERE ARE STILL DUTIES THAT REMAIN THERE AND THEREFORE YOU HAVE TO BACK FILL SOME OF THE POSITIONS TO CONTINUE THE DUTIES THE STAFF WHAT DOES THIS IS A FAIR SUMMARY OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID. RIGHT THE CA CFP PROGRAM IS SHIFTING TO DS US BUT THESE POSITIONS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY FUNDED WITH C. A. C. F. P. ADMINISTRATIVE DOLLARS ARE SUPPORTING OTHER PROGRAM THAT SEATS ARE UNRELATED. THE PROGRAM THAT ARE- THAT WOULD NO LONGER BE FUNDED. YOU SORT OF SAID RIGHT AND THEN YOU MADE A COMMENT AFTER THAT THAT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE IT MATCHED SO UP- LET ME JUST NOT DWELL ON THIS TOO MUCH BUT LET ME ASK AMY LEE pTHAT BEFORE WE MOVE ON AND I SEE EDGAR CAME ON AND I DON'T KNOW IF.

FROM YOUR- OUR- EXACTLY WHAT THE TRAVIS GOING TO LOOK LIKE A MORE POSITIONS WERE NEEDED THE- REMOTE ORIGINAL COME. EVERY OTHERS OPERATION HELLO WE DON'T HAVE DISAGREE. FOLLOW ME BECAUSE PARTY'S PRIOR CONVERSELY. EVEN THE GOVERNOR'S. THERE WILL IN APRIL. MATTER FOR ADDITIONAL. FUNDING FOR DEFENSE FOR THE CHILD TO THE SERVICES THAT ARE WE THINK THE ADDITIONAL.

PARK HAS THE HIGHER. ADMIN REIMBURSEMENT COMPARED TO THE OTHER CHILD NUTRITION PROGRAMS THE CDC HAS USED ALL OF THOSE NEW PROGRAMS TOGETHER TO CREATE A STAFFING MONITORING STRUCTURE WHERE OUR TEAM GOES OUT AND DAY MONITORING PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. ACROSS ALL OF THOSE MEAL PROGRAMS THE A. C. F. P. AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE SCHOOL MEAL ONCE THE ONCE THE C. A. C. F. P. IS REMOVED AND TRANSITIONED OVER TO DSS. AT THE END LEAVE CD WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO USE SOME OF THE STATE ADMINISTRATOR FUNDS FROM USDA TO HELP OPERATE THE REST OF THE PROGRAMS THAT GET A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER ADMINISTRATIVE.
