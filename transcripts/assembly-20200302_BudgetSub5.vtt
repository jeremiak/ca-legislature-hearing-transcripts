REDUCTIONS HAVE HELPED US IN A

00:34:07.745 --> 00:34:08.946
PROVIDE DISABILITY TO CHANGE

00:34:09.013 --> 00:34:12.116
HOW WE REACH THE INMATES ARE

00:34:12.183 --> 00:34:12.750

REHABILITATION HAS RECENTLY

00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:22.693
CHANGED. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.395
IT IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN

00:34:24.462 --> 00:34:26.531
IT WAS YEARS AGO IT IS MORE A

00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:28.232
MISSION STATEMENT THAT'S- MORE

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:29.967
DRIVEN TOWARDS THE NEEDS OF THE

00:34:30.034 --> 00:34:31.569
INDIVIDUALS WITH THE ULTIMATE

00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:33.371
GOAL OF RE ENTRY. BACK INTO OUR

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:36.107
COMMUNITIES. BUT THEY CAN JUST

00:34:36.174 --> 00:34:36.941
GOING BACK TO THE POPULATION

00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:39.477
QUESTION. THE REDUCTIONS HAVE

00:34:39.544 --> 00:34:40.945
BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY. TOO MANY

00:34:41.012 --> 00:34:42.246
AVENUES THROUGH A VARIETY OF

00:34:42.313 --> 00:34:43.614
LEGISLATION VOTER APPROVED

00:34:43.681 --> 00:34:45.283

INCLUDE AND I WON'T GET INTO

00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:48.753
THE DETAILS AB ONE OH NINE

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.888
PROPERTY SIX PROP FORTY SEVEN

00:34:50.955 --> 00:34:52.290
AND MOST RECENTLY. PROP FIFTY

00:34:52.356 --> 00:34:54.258
SEVEN. WHICH I BELIEVE. HAS

00:34:54.325 --> 00:34:55.493
REALLY CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE OF

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.462
CORRECTIONS AND HOW ARE STAFF

00:34:57.528 --> 00:34:58.996

00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:01.532
PUTTING THE ARE IN ITS RIGHTFUL

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.367
PLACE IN REHABILITATION THE CDC

00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:05.570

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:06.904
THOUSAND AND SIX BUT I. YOU

00:35:06.971 --> 00:35:08.406
KNOW JUST THROUGH THE RECESSION

00:35:08.473 --> 00:35:09.774
IN TOUGH TIMES. IT REALLY MEANS

00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:12.376
MORE NOW THAN IN TIME ELSE-

00:35:12.443 --> 00:35:12.877
WE'RE DEALING WITH LESS

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:14.612
INMATES. WERE DEALING WITH THE

00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:16.013
ABILITY TO RUN. A DIFFERENT

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.716
WAY. TO PROVIDE BETTER REENTRY

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:20.017
COMMUNICATING WITH A PROBATION

00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:21.452
PARTNERS- AND ALSO THE

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:23.554
COMMUNITY. TO LET THEM KNOW

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:24.489
WHAT THE IMAGE ARE BEING

00:35:24.555 --> 00:35:26.357
PROVIDED WHEN THEY DO GO HOME.

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:27.058
AND TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:28.526
CONTINUITY OF CARE STATUS WITH

00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:32.697
THEM- WHAT WE HAVE- INCREASED-

00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:33.798
UNDER THE AUTHORITY CREDIT

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:36.133
EARNINGS AND INTOTHIS

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.068
WAR CREDIT FOR INMATES

00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:39.203
PARTICIPATING IN. VARIOUS REHAB

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.105
PROGRAMS INCLUDING HIGH SCHOOL

AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS FACE FACE

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.774
COLLAGEN THIRTY FOUR OF OUR

00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:45.343
INSTITUTIONS. IT'S LIKE NO

00:35:45.409 --> 00:35:46.911
OTHER AND NOW WITH THE

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:48.379
IMPLEMENTATION COMING UP FOR

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:49.714
THE INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE ABUSE

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.982
DISORDER TREATMENT WHICH I

00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:53.718
THINK IS A- IS SOMETHING THAT'S

00:35:53.784 --> 00:35:56.521
BEEN LONG OVERDUE IN OUR PRISON

00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:57.288
SYSTEM. THE ONE PIECE OF THE-

00:35:57.355 --> 00:35:58.656
POPULATION REDUCTIONS THAT

00:35:58.723 --> 00:36:00.258
DON'T THAT DOESN'T TALKED ABOUT

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:01.292
VERY MUCH AND THAT'S THE

00:36:01.359 --> 00:36:02.927
AUTHORITY VESTED IN CORRECTIONS

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:04.529
IN THE ELEVEN SEVENTY D. IN THE

00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:06.531
PENAL CODE. AND WHAT THAT DOES

00:36:06.597 --> 00:36:08.499
IT ALLOW THE SECRETARY TO REFER

00:36:08.566 --> 00:36:10.067
INMATES BACK TO SENSING COURSE

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:11.536
FOR VARIOUS REASONS EITHER

00:36:11.602 --> 00:36:12.737
CHANGES IN LOS SENSING

00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:15.873
DISCREPANCIES- BUT ALSO I THINK

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.941
ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ONES IT'S

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:19.310
TO- REFER CASES. BACK TO

00:36:19.377 --> 00:36:20.745
FENCING COURTS RECOGNIZING THE

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.282
CAN SHOW THE SENSE IN COURT

00:36:24.348 --> 00:36:25.516
HELEN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN

SENTENCED HAS CHANGED AND- FOUR

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.521
CENTS IN RECONSIDERATION. WHAT

00:36:30.588 --> 00:36:31.355
THAT'S BEEN DOING INSTEAD OF

00:36:31.422 --> 00:36:33.124
OUR INSTITUTIONS INMATES ARE

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.825

NO OTHER TIME- THEY ARE.

00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:39.897
ACTIVELY TRYING TO REESTABLISH

00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:42.600
FAMILY TIES AND ACTIVELY TRYING

00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:44.001
TO BETTER THEMSELVES NOT ONLY

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:44.769
FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR THE

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:46.337
COMMUNITY THEY LIVE IN IN THESE

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:48.139
PRISONS IN THESE PRESENT THEM

00:36:48.205 --> 00:36:49.774
PARTICULAR THESE PRISON YARDS.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.944
SO IT'S BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL-

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.746
BEYOND THE CRITICAL ITEMS THAT-

00:36:55.813 --> 00:36:57.281
BUT I SPOKEN ABOUT I THINK

00:36:57.348 --> 00:36:58.316
CORRECTION OF THE HOLD THE

00:36:58.382 --> 00:36:59.650
POPULATION REDUCTION CAN BE

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:01.385
ATTRIBUTED. TO THE PARTNERSHIP

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:02.353
THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED OF THE

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.288
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS.

00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:05.690
PROGRAMS LIKE DOT PROGRAMS THAT

00:37:05.756 --> 00:37:07.024
WE'VE NEVER HAD IN THE PAST

00:37:07.091 --> 00:37:08.259
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE COMEIN

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:10.995
THAT- TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:12.730
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF AS- OR

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:14.999
HOW HOW COULD THAT. BENEFIT ANY

00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:17.034
IN MAY BUT IF YOU COME INTO AN

00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:18.269
INSTITUTION TAKE A LOOK AT SOME

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:19.537
OF THESE PROGRAMS PARTICULAR

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:21.372
THE DOG PROGRAM. IN VARIOUS

00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:22.807
INSTITUTIONS THIS CHANGE THE

00:37:22.873 --> 00:37:23.908
DYNAMIC OF WHAT WE HAVE FOUND

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:25.276
IS THAT IMAGE OR SEEKING A

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:27.478
PURPOSE A GREATER PURPOSE. AND

00:37:27.545 --> 00:37:29.547
WHAT GREATER PURPOSE IS TO. PUT

00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:31.315
A LIVING AN ENTITY A DOG IN

00:37:31.382 --> 00:37:32.783
FRONT OF THEM TO TRAIN THEM TO

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:33.718
HELP PEOPLE BE ON THEMSELVES

00:37:33.784 --> 00:37:35.186
EVERYTHING FROM VETERANS

00:37:35.252 --> 00:37:37.288
SUFFERING FROM PTSD AND OTHER

00:37:37.355 --> 00:37:39.290
NEEDS. DISABLED DISABLED

00:37:39.357 --> 00:37:40.791
INDIVIDUALS TO TRAIN THEM TO

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:43.194
ASSIST OF THE FIFTH AND DOGS.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:43.761
AND THEN ALSO JUST THE MORE

00:37:43.828 --> 00:37:45.930
STANDARD RESCUE. THE INMATES OF

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:48.132
POURED BACK INTO THESE- INTO

00:37:48.199 --> 00:37:49.767
THESE DOGS BUT- THAT DOES THIS

00:37:49.834 --> 00:37:52.036
CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE

00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:54.105
PRISONS- THOSE ARE JUST A FEW

00:37:54.171 --> 00:37:58.376
EXAMPLES- I DO WANT TO SAY THAT

00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:00.011
THROUGH THE AMBITIOUS-

00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:01.445
POPULATION REDUCTION THAT WE'VE

00:38:01.512 --> 00:38:03.714
UNDERTAKEN WE HAVE. TAKEN DOWN

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.349
OUR PRISON FROM ON THE STATE.

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:07.385
WHICH IS A GOOD THING- WERE NOW

00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:09.587
IN LINE TO BRING DOWN- THE LAST

00:38:09.654 --> 00:38:11.522
OF OUR TO PRIVATE FOR PROFIT

00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:13.257
PRISONS- BY APRIL OF NEXT

00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:15.993
MONTH. BUT THEN WE ALSO HAVE. A

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.896
PLAN TO BRING DOWN OUR-

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:19.930
MODIFIED COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL

00:38:19.997 --> 00:38:21.165
FACILITIES WHICH REALLY

00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:24.001
CONTRACTED WITH- SHAFTER TAFT

00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:26.170
AND MAKE FOR AN DELANO. AND

00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:27.371
THOSE ARE GOING TO BE COMING

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:31.208
DOWN IN THE LATEST ONE IN

00:38:31.275 --> 00:38:33.077
TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO FOR THAT

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:33.844
A BELIEVER IN A BETTER PLACE

00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:35.046
AND WHAT THAT'S ALLOWED US TO

00:38:35.112 --> 00:38:39.884
DO IS UTILIZE SPACE BETTER- TO

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:41.986
PUT LESSEN MASON AREAS THAT WE-

00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:42.887
THAT WE USED TO HAVE

00:38:42.953 --> 00:38:44.955
OVERCROWDED BUT- I THINK THE

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:46.457
USE OF OUR GYMS THE MORE USE OF

00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:48.359
SPACE AND LESS INMATES

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:50.728
ILLUSTRIS ON STAFF IS PROBABLY

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:51.529
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS WE CAN

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:54.965
DO LASTLY A CLOSE WITH- TO

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:56.734
SUSTAIN THESE CHANGES AND

00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:58.636
REDUCTION JUST NOT JUST FOR THE

00:38:58.703 --> 00:39:00.371
SAKE OF BRINGING INMATES DOWN A

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:02.073
POPULATION DOWN. PROP FIFTY

00:39:02.139 --> 00:39:03.808
SEVEN WAS REALLY PUT THEIR TO

00:39:03.874 --> 00:39:05.342
ENHANCE INMATES ACCESS TO

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:06.610
REHABILITATION AND HAVE THEM

00:39:06.677 --> 00:39:08.212
SEE CUT REHABILITATION IN WAYS

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:10.314
I NEVER DID IN THE PAST. I KNOW

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:12.216
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PROFIT THE

00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:12.683
SEVEN IT REALLY FROM A

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.152
PERSPECTIVE OF. BLOWING UP

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:15.753
PRISON NUMBERS GETTING PEOPLE

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.123
OUT FASTER. BUT THE I THINK THE

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.791
POPULATION REDUCTION AS A

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:22.159
PERTAINS TO FIFTY SEVEN I THINK

00:39:22.226 --> 00:39:24.428
THAT'S- A BENEFIT. TO THE

00:39:24.495 --> 00:39:25.529
INMATE SEEKING REHABILITATION

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:26.263
AND SEEKING TO BETTER

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:29.266
THEMSELVES. AND I THINK THAT'S

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:31.268
WHERE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT

00:39:31.335 --> 00:39:33.704
CREDITS AND INCENTIVES. IMAGE

00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:35.172
TO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAMS NOT

00:39:35.239 --> 00:39:36.140
JUST TO GET OUT OF PRISON NOT

00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:37.608
JUST TO GET OUT SOONER. THEY

00:39:37.675 --> 00:39:38.709
HAVE TO GET OUT AT THE RIGHT

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:40.144
TIME WITH THE RIGHT DOSAGE AND

00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:41.112
THEY'VE KERN THESE THINGS

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:42.480
PARTICIPATING IN COURSES IN

00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:44.782
ACHIEVING- MASTERY OF SKILLS IN

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:47.818
CERTAIN PROGRAM SO- I'M VERY

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:49.487
LOOKING FORWARD TO- THAN WHAT

00:39:49.553 --> 00:39:50.821
SOME OF THESE THAT REDUCTION TO

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:52.890
BRING US- AND I KNOW SOME OF

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:54.258
THE CONCERNS THAT COME UP

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:55.593
ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHICH PRISON

00:39:55.659 --> 00:39:56.927

I CAN TELL YOU THAT. THESE

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:06.871
AREN'T EASY TASK TO BRING.

00:40:06.937 --> 00:40:08.739
STATE OWNED PRISONS DOWN IS NOT

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:11.876
AN EASY THING TO DO- BECAUSE-

00:40:11.942 --> 00:40:13.644
ALL POPULATIONS AREN'T CREATED

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:15.412
THE SAME AND THEY'RE NOT HOUSE

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:16.046
THE SAME OR THEY'RE NOT TREATED

00:40:16.113 --> 00:40:18.582
THE SAME THERE ARE THESE- SUB

00:40:18.649 --> 00:40:20.017
SUB POPULATIONS THAT HAVE

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:21.318
NEEDS- THAT ARE REQUIRED IN

00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:23.120
CERTAIN INSTITUTIONS AND

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:24.221
THERE'S ALSO THE STAFF TO

00:40:24.288 --> 00:40:26.157
CONSIDER AS WE BRING THEM DOWN-

00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:27.892
AND ANY. YOU KNOW ANY

00:40:27.958 --> 00:40:29.727

THIS DAY IT THERE'S UNINTENDED

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.065
CONSEQUENCES BY COMING OUT TOO

SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE

00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:04.361
NEEDS A RECENT STUDY FOUND OF

00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:19.930
OF STATE FACILITIES AND THE

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:21.298
POSSIBILITY OF PRISON CLOSURE

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:23.200
IN THE NEAR TERM. AND WE

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:25.069
RECOMMEND- THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:27.271
DIRECT CD START TO CLOSE TO

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:28.939
PRISONS IN THE NEAR TERM. THIS

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:30.808
WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO AVOID-

00:43:30.874 --> 00:43:32.242
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AT

00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:33.377
THOSE TWO PRESENTS AND THEN

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:35.446
CONCENTRATE- REMAINING EFFORTS

00:43:35.512 --> 00:43:36.981
AND RESOURCES AT THE OTHER

00:43:37.047 --> 00:43:37.781
PRISONS THAT ARE AND

00:43:37.848 --> 00:43:39.450
SIGNIFICANT NEED OF REPAIR.

00:43:39.516 --> 00:43:40.918
WHICH WE THINK WOULD REDUCE-

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:42.853
REDUCE THE REST OF STATUS SUED

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.388
FOR THE RESULTING ACT THE

00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:45.489
CONDITIONS RESULTING FROM POOR

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:48.592
INFRASTRUCTURE- CLOSING TO

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:49.526
PRISONS WOULD ALSO RESULT IN

00:43:49.593 --> 00:43:50.694
ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION AN

00:43:50.761 --> 00:43:51.829
ANNUAL OPERATIONAL SAVINGS

00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:52.896
RELATIVE TO THE

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:54.398
ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO.

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:55.933
REMOVE AN FOR INMATES FROM

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.835
PUBLIC CONTRACTS AND THEN CLOSE

00:43:57.901 --> 00:43:59.837
ONE AT PRESENT WE ALSO

00:43:59.903 --> 00:44:01.672
RECOMMEND REQUIRING CDC ARE TO

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:03.440
DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO IMPROVE

00:44:03.507 --> 00:44:05.075
INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE REMAINING

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:06.443
PRESENCE- AND THAT WOULD

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:09.013
INVOLVE. THEM SUBMITTING A LIST

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:09.813

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:22.893
PRIORITIZES ISSUES THAT

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.728
THREATEN THE IN MAINE STAFF

REDUCE COSTS IN A NUMBER OF

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:30.501
WAYS. BETWEEN THE DETAILS-

FURTHER IN OUR REPORT. AND

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:34.171
FINALLY ON PAGE FIVE I'M JUST

00:44:34.238 --> 00:44:35.539
GOING TO GOING TO A BIT MORE

KEY TOPIC FOR TODAY- WE- WE

00:44:41.945 --> 00:44:44.081
GET. RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:45.516
LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:48.185
DEPARTMENT TO IDENTIFY A RANK

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:52.322
PRISONS FOR CLOSURE- BASED ON

00:44:52.389 --> 00:44:53.724
KEY CARD KEY CRITERIA WE THINK

00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:54.258
THE STATE SHOULD CONSIDER

00:44:54.324 --> 00:44:55.626
CLOSING PRISONS WITH HIGH

00:44:55.692 --> 00:44:58.128
OPERATIONAL COSTS- INDOOR

COSTLY INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS

00:44:59.396 --> 00:45:00.864
RELATIVE TO THE AMOUNT OF IN

00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:02.633
MAKE CAPACITY THAT THEY GIVE TO

00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:05.569
THE SYSTEM. AND THE STATE WE-

00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:07.638
WE WOULD ALSO WANT TO LIKELY

00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:09.640
AVOID THE CLOSING- OR BE

00:45:09.706 --> 00:45:10.774
COGNIZANT OF THE IMPACTS OF

00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:12.209
CLOSING PRISONS WITH.

00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:13.310
SPECIALIZED MISSIONS FOR

EXAMPLE PRISONS THAT ARE

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:16.847
SPECIALIZED IN PROVIDING THE

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:17.681
HIGHEST LEVELS OF HEALTH CARE

00:45:17.748 --> 00:45:20.350

00:45:20.417 --> 00:45:22.686
THE- PRISONS THAT HAVE

00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:23.854

RECRUITING RECRUITING STAFF-

00:45:29.827 --> 00:45:32.563
DUE TO THEIR LOCATION- COULD BE

00:45:32.629 --> 00:45:33.697
PART TIED FOR CLOSURE OVER

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:35.299
OTHER PERSONS THAT OPERATE MORE

00:45:35.365 --> 00:45:36.800
EFFECTIVELY. AND ANY OF THE

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:38.135
LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO IDENTIFY

00:45:38.202 --> 00:45:39.169
OTHER CRITERIA THAT IT WOULD

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:41.839
LIKE TO BE CONSIDERED- IN NOT

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:44.074
RANKING. AND THEN WE RECOMMEND

00:45:44.141 --> 00:45:45.776
THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE

00:45:45.843 --> 00:45:46.710

THAT WOULD OUTLINED IT

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:54.551
ESSENTIALLY DRESS THE KEY

00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:56.520

HAPPEN TO- FACILITATE A PRISON

00:45:59.823 --> 00:46:02.259

00:46:02.326 --> 00:46:04.862
PART OF THAT PLAN- AND CLOSURE

00:46:04.928 --> 00:46:06.196

EFFECTS ON THE WORK FORCE AND

00:46:14.171 --> 00:46:15.205
DAY TO DAY OPERATION SO WE

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:23.533
RESULT THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.335
THAN THEY WERE AND THERE'S NO

00:48:25.402 --> 00:48:26.303
QUESTION THAT THERE HAS BEEN

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:28.238
MORE REHABILITATIVE

00:48:28.305 --> 00:48:29.940
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE IN

MIND THAT. CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS

00:48:41.852 --> 00:48:44.187
ARE STILL VERY OVERCROWDED- BY

00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:46.323
THEIR OWN ESTIMATE SYSTEM WIDE

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:47.891
THERE AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:49.760
30% OF WHAT THEY WERE DESIGNED

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:51.628
FOR SOME PRISONS ARE AT A

00:48:51.695 --> 00:48:52.929
HUNDRED AND 60% OF WHAT THEY

00:48:52.996 --> 00:48:55.966
WERE DESIGNED FOR AND MANY ARE

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:57.901
IN THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO

00:48:57.968 --> 00:49:02.306
HUNDRED AND SIXTY RANGE. SO THE

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:04.574
THE IMP. THE WE'RE OP. AFTER A

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:05.976
SYSTEM WHICH IS AN OVERCROWDED

00:49:06.043 --> 00:49:07.344
IT IS VERY OVERCROWDED AND

00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:09.479
SQUAT. IT CAUSES A LOT OF

00:49:09.546 --> 00:49:11.214
LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS. IN

00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:13.617
OPERATING THAT SYSTEM- MANY OF

WHICH MISTER DE AS HESTER ARE.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.689

RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK THEY

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:26.930
THOUGHT FALL AND I THINK THEY

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:29.433
SET OUT ON. A PROCESS BY WHICH

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:34.271
THAT CAN HAPPEN. IN TERMS OF

THE POPULATION REDUCTION THIS

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.108
ISN'T A IT'S BEEN PRESENTED AS

00:49:38.175 --> 00:49:40.811
SOMETHING PASSIVE. IN THE SENSE

00:49:40.877 --> 00:49:43.380
OF WELL IF THE POPULATION TREND

CREDITS- AND THE AMOUNT OF

00:50:01.264 --> 00:50:05.502
CREDITS SO- IN MY OPINION THE

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:07.170
DEPARTMENT HAS THE ABILITY. TO

00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:09.239
MAINTAIN A DECREASE IN

00:50:09.306 --> 00:50:10.407
POPULATION THROUGH THOSE TWO

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:14.611
MECHANISMS THE THIRD- GOING TO

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:16.913
THE INFRASTRUCTURE AS THE LA OO

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.749
AND THAT YOUR STAFF HAVE

00:50:18.815 --> 00:50:21.118
DEMONSTRATED. THERE'S AN ALMOST

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.552
A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR NEED

00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:25.689
FOR- INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR

00:50:25.756 --> 00:50:28.358
BASED ON THE- THE ELEVEN

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:30.060
BILLION DOLLARS THAT IDENTIFIED

00:50:30.127 --> 00:50:32.195
BY KITCHELL AND THEN ANOTHER

00:50:32.262 --> 00:50:34.965
EIGHT SOMETHING- IDENTIFIED BY

00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:37.300
THE CDC I'M SELF. SO THESE TO

00:50:37.367 --> 00:50:38.535
INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIRS ARE

00:50:38.602 --> 00:50:40.270
SORELY NEEDED BECAUSE THE

00:50:40.337 --> 00:50:42.139
PRISONS ARE REALLY CRUMBLING-

00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:44.775
SOME OF THEM. AND THEY MAKE

00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:46.610
LIFE FOR MY CLIENTS THE PEOPLE

00:50:46.676 --> 00:50:47.911
WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN

00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:50.814
INTOLERABLE IN SOME RESPECTS I

00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:52.949
WANT TO READ TO YOU. A COUPLE

00:50:53.016 --> 00:50:54.284
OF SENTENCES FROM A COURT ORDER

00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:56.052
THAT WE RECENTLY OBTAINED LAST

00:50:56.119 --> 00:50:59.556
YEAR ABOUT THE FACT THAT IN ONE

00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:00.290
OF THE PRISONS THE ROOF WAS

00:51:00.357 --> 00:51:03.527
FAILING- THE JUDGE WROTE IT IS

00:51:03.593 --> 00:51:06.463
A SHAME THAT THE STATE OF

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:06.997
CALIFORNIA AND DEPARTMENT

00:51:07.063 --> 00:51:08.932
CORRECTIONS AND REBUILD. HAVE A

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:10.200
LOT OF THE FACILITY A DINING

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:16.239
BEFORE ALL TO SEE JUST DISTRICT.

00:51:16.306 --> 00:51:17.741
IT IN SPAIN IT'S A PICTURE OF A

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:19.609
CORRECTION. CIVIL WHEN I GO.

00:51:19.676 --> 00:51:21.378
CAN SELL BOTH ITS LOCATION IN

00:51:21.445 --> 00:51:22.679
THE NATION AND THE STATE OF

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:24.581
SUCH FINANCIAL ABUNDANCE AND

00:51:24.648 --> 00:51:26.716
ADVANCE LEGAL STANDARDS FOR THE

00:51:26.783 --> 00:51:29.286
HABITABILITY OF REAL PROPERTY

00:51:29.352 --> 00:51:31.054
AND CLEANLINESS OF FOOD

00:51:31.121 --> 00:51:32.489
SERVICES ESTABLISHMENTS AS YOU

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:35.592
REAL RECALL. THE FACT OF THAT

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:38.562
THE ROOF FAILED MEANT THAT-

00:51:38.628 --> 00:51:41.398
THERE WERE- FECES FROM BIRDS

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:44.267
FALLING ON TO THE DINING HALL-

00:51:44.334 --> 00:51:49.439
WATER DAMAGE WAS- POLLUTING OF

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:51.475
THE DINING HALL AND THE LIKE SO

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.910
THESE INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIRS-

00:51:53.977 --> 00:51:56.813
NEED TO BE. PUT ON A VERY-

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.449
URGENT LEVEL MISTER DE AS HAS

00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:01.485
BEEN GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO ALLOW

00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:03.954
US TO- TO GO INSPECT THE

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:05.889
PRISONS. FROM THE KITCHEN

00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:08.658
REPORT TO- PROVIDE OUR INPUT ON

00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:09.926
WHAT A LIST OF PRIORITIES

00:52:09.993 --> 00:52:11.728
SHOULD BE BUT I URGE THE

00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:14.297
COMMITTEE TO- MAKE THAT A

00:52:14.364 --> 00:52:17.534
PRIORITY AS WELL AND BOTH OF. I

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:18.935
WOULD HOPE THAT SOME OF THE

00:52:19.002 --> 00:52:21.137
FUNDS COULD BE PUT IN THE MAYOR

00:52:21.204 --> 00:52:23.373
THE VISOR THE OR THE JUNE

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:24.841
BUDGET SO THAT THEY CAN GET

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:27.444
STARTED IN SOME OF THE MOST

00:52:27.511 --> 00:52:30.914
CRITICAL PLACES. THANK YOU.

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:32.749
THANK YOU. OKAY ANY QUESTIONS

00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:35.619
FROM MEMBERS. WE'LL HAVE TO YOU

00:52:35.685 --> 00:52:37.220
HAVE WITH US WAS TO TING OR

00:52:37.287 --> 00:52:40.123
COMPARED BUT EACH YEAR THANKS

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:41.825
FOR BEING HERE. WITH THE STONE.

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:42.759
THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER

00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:45.362
SECRETARY FOR BEING HERE AND

00:52:45.428 --> 00:52:45.929
TAKING US THROUGH THE SAID I

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:47.864
THINK JUST THE- A FEW COMMENTS

00:52:47.931 --> 00:52:49.666
AND THEN TRYING TO MAKE SURE

00:52:49.733 --> 00:52:50.467
WERE HEADED IN THE RIGHT

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:51.368
DIRECTION. I THINK A COUPLE

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:54.137
YEARS AGO. THIS COMMITTEE WAS

00:52:54.204 --> 00:52:55.839
WAS. ASKING FOR THE GOVERNOR'S

00:52:55.906 --> 00:52:57.207
THAT COME FORWARD IS HOW HOW DO

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:58.542
WE START TO TALK ABOUT CLOSING

00:52:58.608 --> 00:53:01.177
PRISONS. AND IF YOU ARE ABLE TO

00:53:01.244 --> 00:53:02.178
COME UP WITH A PLAN THEN WE

00:53:02.245 --> 00:53:04.614
WOULD. I THINK EVERYBODY IS IT

00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:06.082
SHOULD BE A LITTLE FEARFUL OF

00:53:06.149 --> 00:53:08.285
US COMING UP WITH A PLAN SINCE

00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:09.819
YOU'RE THE EXPERT SAID. IN HOW

00:53:09.886 --> 00:53:11.755
IT GETS DONE. SO I'M A LITTLE

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:13.023
BIT CONCERNED AT AT THE

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:14.624
RELUCTANCE TO MOVE FORWARD

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:16.459
BECAUSE I THINK WE DO HAVE A

00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:17.360
SITUATION WHERE WE SPENT.

00:53:17.427 --> 00:53:18.862
BUILDING CAPACITY IN SENDING

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:20.797
MORE MORE PEOPLE THE PRESIDENT

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:22.098
OF THE LAST NUMBER OF DECADES

00:53:22.165 --> 00:53:23.700
THROUGH AND A NUMBER OF.

00:53:23.767 --> 00:53:26.202
INITIATIVES THAT. HAVE NOT KEPT

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:27.337
OUR COMMUNITY SAFER BUT HAVE

00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:29.072
JUST PUT MORE MORE PEOPLE TO

00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:29.539
PRESENT IN WITHOUT THE

00:53:29.606 --> 00:53:31.575
REHABILITATION. WHEN THEY COME

00:53:31.641 --> 00:53:33.276
OUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ADDING. TO

00:53:33.343 --> 00:53:34.778
THE LACK OF SAFETY IN OUR

00:53:34.844 --> 00:53:36.680
COMMUNITIES WE- HAVE NOT BEEN

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:38.682
WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:53:38.748 --> 00:53:40.383
GOAL BUT JUST THIS NOTION OF.

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:41.017
LOCKING PEOPLE UP FOR THE SAKE

00:53:41.084 --> 00:53:42.619
OF LACKEY BLACK. SO UNLESS

00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:45.188
WE'RE ON A REAL TRAJECTORY. TO

00:53:45.255 --> 00:53:46.022
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BEDS IN

00:53:46.089 --> 00:53:48.091
THERE AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

00:53:48.158 --> 00:53:50.060
PEOPLE. THAT WE ARE SENDING TO

00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:52.462
PRESENT IT AND M. SINCE. THEN

00:53:52.529 --> 00:53:54.664
WE'RE WE'RE CONSTANTLY BE

00:53:54.731 --> 00:53:57.634
CHASING. MONEY AFTER- AFTER.

00:53:57.701 --> 00:53:59.235
MONEY REALLY AND IN THESE

00:53:59.302 --> 00:54:01.071
PROGRAMS I THINK FOR US TO BE

00:54:01.137 --> 00:54:02.906
ABLE TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS.

00:54:02.973 --> 00:54:04.608
IN INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS

00:54:04.674 --> 00:54:05.308
WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:06.910
PUSHING UP AGAINST THIS FEAR

00:54:06.977 --> 00:54:08.178
THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING IS

00:54:08.244 --> 00:54:11.114
FACILITATING. MAINTAINING THAT

00:54:11.181 --> 00:54:13.116
SPACE MAINTAINING CERTAIN

00:54:13.183 --> 00:54:14.784
CAPACITIES WITHOUT THAT GETTING

00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:16.219
TO OUR REHABILITATIVE GOALS.

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:18.855
AND REALLY OUR PRISON REDUCTION

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:20.690
GOALS REDUCING THE THAT NUMBER

00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:22.792
OF. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HOUSE

00:54:22.859 --> 00:54:24.728
ESPECIALLY HOUSED UNNECESSARILY

00:54:24.794 --> 00:54:27.530
OR WERE COULD BE HELD IN

00:54:27.597 --> 00:54:28.798
DIFFERENT PLACES. SO I THINK

00:54:28.865 --> 00:54:30.033
THAT'S WHEN THINGS THAT THAT

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.435
NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT HERE. AND

00:54:32.502 --> 00:54:34.204
I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:35.438
TO THE ABILITY TO COME FOR THE

00:54:35.505 --> 00:54:38.341
PLANET I THINK THE PLAN ALSO IF

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:39.576
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS AMOUNT OF

00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:40.543
WORK. IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:41.811
ABOUT WORK BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:43.647
THAT COULD BE DO A LOT OF IT. I

00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:45.448
THINK THIS COULD ALSO SET UP

00:54:45.515 --> 00:54:47.417
CRITERIA FOR LOOKING EVEN

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:49.285
FURTHER AHEAD OF HOW WE

00:54:49.352 --> 00:54:53.323
CONTINUE TO KEEP MAIN GOALS IN

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.890
THE FOREFRONT. ALSO HOW WE

00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:56.059
SCORE TO IDENTIFY ATTRIBUTES

00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:58.395
MILESTONES CHANGES THAT

00:54:58.461 --> 00:55:00.764
CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR. CLOSING

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.666
MORE PRISONS AS THEIR- AS

00:55:02.732 --> 00:55:05.368
BECOMES NECESSARY. AND ONE

00:55:05.435 --> 00:55:06.770
THING THAT HAS COME UP SO THAT

00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:08.638
THE LA- WAS TALKING ABOUT THE-

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:10.874
THE PUBLIC. CONTRACTED BEDS AND

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.609
I THINK IN YOUR STATEMENT. WE

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:14.044
WERE LOOKING TO CLOSE THOSE

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:15.979
PUBLIC CONTRACTED BUT STAY OUT.

00:55:16.046 --> 00:55:17.047
SO I GUESS THERE'S A THERE'S A

00:55:17.113 --> 00:55:19.649
BIT OF A DICHOTOMY THERE. GIVEN

00:55:19.716 --> 00:55:21.384
THAT THOSE BEDS ARE CHEAPER.

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:28.525
AND. RESPECT ON. THAT THIS.

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:30.994
VERSE MAIN. SOME OF THE AND I'M

00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:32.028
NOT WEIGHING IN WITH ANY

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:34.097
PARTICULAR. BENT ON WHICH IS

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:35.432
THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT JUST

00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:36.666
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BETTER.

00:55:36.733 --> 00:55:37.734
THE DECISION MAKING IF WE'RE

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:39.169
GONNA HAVE. GOING TO BE CLOSING

00:55:39.235 --> 00:55:41.504
PRISONS BUT MAINTAINING SOME

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:43.406
FLEXIBILITY. WHAT WITH THE

00:55:43.473 --> 00:55:45.041
TRADE OFFS FOR THE PURPOSE

00:55:45.108 --> 00:55:45.542
STANDPOINT TO MAKE THAT

00:55:45.608 --> 00:55:48.745
DECISION. I THINK THE A ONE THE

00:55:48.812 --> 00:55:50.513
ONE THE STATE GOT INTO THE

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.415
AGREEMENTS WITH. BEGINNING WITH

00:55:52.482 --> 00:55:53.717
OUT OF STATE THE BEGINNING WITH

00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:55.985
AND STATE BEDS CONTRACTING WITH

00:55:56.052 --> 00:55:57.721
EITHER. PROFIT PRIVATE FOR

00:55:57.787 --> 00:55:59.823
PROFIT. FOR COMMUNITY

00:55:59.889 --> 00:56:01.858
CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES WHICH

00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:03.893
ARE RUN BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:04.894
WE NEED THOSE BEDS THE

00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:06.296
OVERCROWDING SITUATION IN OUR

00:56:06.362 --> 00:56:09.032
STATE PRISONS PROPER WITHIN THE

00:56:09.099 --> 00:56:11.101
THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS. AND

NOW READ A POINT TO WHERE WE

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:14.871
ARE DOWN O OUR LAST- BUT I

00:56:14.938 --> 00:56:16.339
THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE

00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:18.575
INSTITUTIONS- WHERE THEY'RE AT

00:56:18.641 --> 00:56:20.076
THESE FACILITIES FIRST OF ALL

BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN.

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:24.881
ALLOWING US PUT INMATES IN

00:56:24.948 --> 00:56:27.884
THOSE BEDS THAT HAVE A VERY LOW

00:56:27.951 --> 00:56:29.919
IF NO MEDICAL NEEDS VERY LOW TO

00:56:29.986 --> 00:56:31.921
NO MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS INMATES

00:56:31.988 --> 00:56:33.189
THAT ARE ON THE LOWER LEVEL OF

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:35.725
THE SECURITY SPECTRUM- SO THE

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:38.361
HOUSE IN THESE FACILITIES BUT

00:56:38.428 --> 00:56:40.296
ONCE AT THE A AND THAT DOES

00:56:40.363 --> 00:56:41.297
CONCERN ME WITH THESE

00:56:41.364 --> 00:56:43.566
FACILITIES IS A- VIGIL THAT

ARE BETTER- WE HAVE- FACE TO

00:57:18.701 --> 00:57:19.402
FACE COLLEGE LIKE I SAID

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:20.303
EARLIER WE HAVE BETTER

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:21.905
VOCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND

00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:22.505
TRAINING INSIDE OF OUR STATE

INMATES TO LEARN TRAITS THAT

00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:29.846
THAT THEY CANNOT GET AND THESE

00:57:29.913 --> 00:57:32.849
COMMUNITY CORRECTION FACILITIES.

WILL. THE EFFORTS FOR THESE

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:38.087
OKAY. ARE BETTER THAN SOME OF

OUR STATE PRISONS. I HAVEN'T

00:57:39.856 --> 00:57:42.458

CHALLENGE THAT. BUT I WOULD SAY

00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:45.929
THAT THE REASON WE HAVE

00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:47.597
SERVICES PROVIDED BY THESE

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:50.533
FACILITIES- WE DO THEM BETTER

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.203
IN STATE PRISON- AND I WOULD

00:57:53.269 --> 00:57:55.505
CHAMPION I WOULD. LOOKAT- TO

00:57:55.572 --> 00:57:56.806
STICK WITH THE PLAN THAT'S BEEN

00:57:56.873 --> 00:57:58.007
PUT FORTH BY THE GOVERNOR TO

00:57:58.074 --> 00:58:00.476
BRING THEM DOWN- AND IN TURN I

00:58:00.543 --> 00:58:01.878
KNOW THAT THE QUESTIONS WILL

00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:03.446
WHICH ONE NEXT WHAT COMES NEXT

00:58:03.513 --> 00:58:05.348
AND I'VE HAD. DISCUSSIONS WITH.

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:07.584
PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE HERE-

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:08.384
AND THEY'RE VERY GOOD

00:58:08.451 --> 00:58:10.386
QUESTIONS. THE TWELVE PRISONERS

00:58:10.453 --> 00:58:12.155
STUDY THAT WE- THAT WE SET

00:58:12.222 --> 00:58:14.557
FORTH AND WITH- KITCHELL AS

00:58:14.624 --> 00:58:15.892
MISTER SPECTER MENTIONED THE

00:58:15.959 --> 00:58:19.195
CONTRACTOR WHO. DID THE STUDY

00:58:19.262 --> 00:58:20.129
ON THE TWELVE OLDEST PRISONS.

00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:22.932
WE HAVE A- WE WORKED WITH THEM

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.667
AND WE HAVE RECEIVED FINAL

00:58:24.734 --> 00:58:26.035
REPORTS IN THE LAST TWELVE NOW

00:58:26.102 --> 00:58:28.438
WE'RE THE NEXT STEP. IS TO WORK

00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:32.075
WITH THE SAME CONTRACTOR TO- TO

00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:34.344
SEEK A PRIORITIZATION- WITH

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:36.446
THEM. TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT.

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:37.647
WHAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:39.315
ARE IN THOSE LOCATIONS BASED ON

00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:40.817
THE POPULATIONS THAT DO EXIST

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:43.686
WITH THEM. AND ALSO TO COME UP

00:58:43.753 --> 00:58:44.220
WITH A PLAN IN REVIEWING

00:58:44.287 --> 00:58:47.090
DEVELOP- AN ORDER IN WHICH THEY

00:58:47.156 --> 00:58:48.458
WERE TO COME DOWN IN THE END IT

00:58:48.524 --> 00:58:49.626
WILL BE A DISCUSSION WITH THE

00:58:49.692 --> 00:58:51.661
ADMINISTRATION ON WHICH ONES.

00:58:51.728 --> 00:58:52.829
WHICH ORDER THEY WERE TO COME

00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:54.831
DOWN CLOSE IN A PRISON IS NOT

00:58:54.898 --> 00:58:58.234
AN EASY THING- WE HAVE SUB SUB

00:58:58.301 --> 00:58:59.736
SETS A POPULATIONS THAT.

00:58:59.802 --> 00:59:02.538
REQUIRE HIGH NEEDS- WE ALSO

00:59:02.605 --> 00:59:05.074
RECOGNIZE THAT- SOME OF THE

00:59:05.141 --> 00:59:06.476
INSTITUTIONS ARE IN LOCATION

00:59:06.542 --> 00:59:08.278
LIKE SAID BEFORE. WE DO HAVE A

00:59:08.344 --> 00:59:09.979
HARD TIME RECRUITING. AND WOULD

00:59:10.046 --> 00:59:11.247
HAVE A HARD TIME RETAINING

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:12.482
PEOPLE IN SOME PLACES AND THE

00:59:12.548 --> 00:59:14.450
CONCERN. IF WE GET AHEAD OF A

00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:16.219
TIME THAT WHEN WE'RE READY TO

00:59:16.286 --> 00:59:17.220
ACTUALLY ANNOUNCE AN

00:59:17.287 --> 00:59:18.488
INSTITUTION. IT WOULD

00:59:18.554 --> 00:59:20.456
NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE ABILITY

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:21.391
TO GET PEOPLE TO EITHER STAY AT

00:59:21.457 --> 00:59:23.126
THE FACILITY OR TO RECRUIT TO

00:59:23.192 --> 00:59:24.294
THAT FACILITY WITH SENATOR

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.995
COULD IMPACT OUR REHABILITATIVE

00:59:26.062 --> 00:59:28.231
EFFORTS AT THAT FACILITY. RIGHT

00:59:28.298 --> 00:59:29.265
AND THEN AND I DO UNDERSTAND

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:30.600
THAT WHICH IS WHY COMING WITH A

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:32.602
PLAN AND- AND RECOGNIZE THE

00:59:32.669 --> 00:59:36.105
APPLICATIONS. I THINK YOUR

00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:36.973
POINT IS WELL TAKEN ABOUT. IT'S

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:37.540
BILL TATE OF SERVICES THAT

00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:40.109
NEEDS TO. REMAIN THE FOCUS AND

00:59:40.176 --> 00:59:42.211
ACTUALLY BE AN ENHANCED FOCUS

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:43.947
AS WE MOVE THROUGH AND IT

00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:44.881
SOUNDS LIKE IN SOME OF THE

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:46.215
CONTRACT THE PUBLIC CONTACT

00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:47.083
FACILITIES WHICH WE NEED TO

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:48.351
GET. COMPLETELY OUT OF THE

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:49.218
BUSINESS OF DEALING WITH A

00:59:49.285 --> 00:59:51.187
PRIVATE CONTRACTOR FACILITIES

00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:53.256
ABSOLUTELY THAT'S THAT'S I

00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:55.124
THINK LONG BEEN A OF A BIT OF A

00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:57.694
STATE IN OUR SYSTEM AND HOW WE-

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.194
SHOULD BE CONTEMPLATING

00:59:58.261 --> 01:00:00.263
OURSELVES. BUT WITH THOSE

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.832
FACILITIES. THOSE THOSE INMATES

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:04.500
THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE. IN

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:06.202
CUSTODY THERE ON THAT CONTRACT

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:08.071
BASIS. PROBABLY ARE ONES THAT

01:00:08.137 --> 01:00:09.405
ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE

01:00:09.472 --> 01:00:12.175
CONSIDERED FOR. RELEASE WAR

01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:13.443
PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE BEEN COULD

01:00:13.509 --> 01:00:15.378
HAVE BEEN HELD T THE AT THE

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:16.479
LOCAL LEVEL AND NOT NECESSARILY

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:19.048
BE. THE BURDEN BECAUSE I THINK

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:22.385
IT'S AS WE GET TO. A SYSTEM

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.988
WITH REDUCED CAPACITY AND

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:25.922
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:27.423
ARE GOING THERE THOSE ARE

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:28.891
SOMETIMES GOING TO BE THE MOST

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.693
DIFFICULT REALLY TO SERVE AND

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.261
SO I THINK THE PROGRAMMING AND

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:34.230
INFRASTRUCTURE IT WILL

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:35.231
DEFINITELY NEED TO REFLECT

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:37.033
THAT- BUT IS WERE MAKING

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.701
DECISIONS AND TRY TO INVEST

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:40.103
AGAIN IN THESE FACILITIES AND

01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:41.337
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:42.105
HELPING TO MEET YOUR

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:43.873
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AS AS SOME

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:44.474
OF THOSE FACILITIES ARE

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.109
CRUMBLING. I THINK WE NEED TO

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:48.044
BE MAKING SURE WHICH IS WHY

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:49.846
THIS COMMITTEES ASKED FOR. TO

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:50.847
THAT WE KNOW THAT WHAT WE'RE

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:51.914
INVESTING IN WITH

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.483
REHABILITATIVE SERVICES. THAT

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:54.851
WE'RE GETTING DATA ON HOW

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:56.753
EFFECTIVE THOSE SERVICES ARE

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:58.721
FOR. BIRD REDUCING RECIDIVISM.

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:00.723
THAT WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON

01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:02.625
AND- WHERE THE POPULATION IS

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:04.060
AND WHAT THOSE SPECIAL NEEDS

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:05.595
ARE SO THAT AS WERE MAKING

01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:07.530
THOSE DECISIONS ABOUT.

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:09.165
REHABILITATING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:01:09.232 --> 01:01:10.700
OR MAKING SURE THAT THAT WE'VE

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:12.168
GOT PROGRAMMING REALLY ACROSS

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:14.003
THE SYSTEM THAT WE UNDERSTAND

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:15.204
WHAT ALL OF THOSE THOSE

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:17.073
IMPLICATIONS ARE. THAT'S WHY

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.841
COMING UP WITH A WITH STANDARDS

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:20.143
IN COMING UP WITH THE PLANNING

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:22.378
DOCUMENTS. AND REALLY BE ABLE

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:23.312
SAID THAT STANDARD AND IN

01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:25.448
LOOKING TO PUT A CLOSE

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:26.983
WONDERFUL GOING CLOSE TO.

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.351
MOVING PEOPLE OUTOF THE

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:30.420
CONTRACT TO FACILITIES YOU KNOW

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:32.522
THAT THAT'S ALL FINE BUT-

01:01:32.588 --> 01:01:34.390
KEEPING IN MIND CRITERIA FOR

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:35.658
EVEN NEXT STEPS THE YOU KNOW

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:37.427
HOW DO WE KEEP LOOKING AT.

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:41.064
IMPROVING AND TESTING OUR GOALS

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.265
ALONG THAT WAY BECAUSE THEN

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:43.366
THAT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER FOR

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:45.201
THIS COMMITTEE TO BE ABLE TO DO

01:01:45.268 --> 01:01:46.803
THE INVESTMENT IN THE EXISTING

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:48.638
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU NEED

01:01:48.704 --> 01:01:50.373
VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; ROOFS VIçT OTHERS. SO&lt;/c&gt;

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.275
THAT WE'RE NOT CONTINUE INTO TO

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:54.644
THROW GO GOOD MONEY AFTER JUST

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:56.345
CHASING MORE BEDS KEEPING

01:01:56.412 --> 01:01:58.347
CAPACITIES UP WHEN I THINK WE

01:01:58.414 --> 01:02:00.283
ALL HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:01.551
SURE THAT WE ARE REDUCING THOSE

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:04.754
COULD THE ACTUAL NEED. FOR SOME

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:06.589
OF THESE FACILITIES OVER TIME

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.357
SO THAT'S WHY. I'D LIKE TO GET

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:10.560
THERE IN AND NOT. I THINK

01:02:10.626 --> 01:02:13.062
THERE'S LESS. SPECULATION ABOUT

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:13.963
WHAT IF THIS BALLOT MEASURE

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.298
PASSES WITHOUT ABOUT MEASURE

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:16.532
PASSES I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:18.935
BE. SHY ABOUTPUTTING TOGETHER

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:20.670
AN AGGRESSIVE PLAN THINGS MAY

01:02:20.736 --> 01:02:22.171
CHANGE LONGTIME BUT THERE'S A

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:23.005
LOT OF CONTROL WITHIN THE

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:24.841
SYSTEM. TO AFFECT THE

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:27.343
POPULATION AND WHO'S WHERE AND

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.312
WHY AND FOR PUSHING MORE FOR

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:31.114
REHABILITATIVE SERVICES AND I

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.281
WOULD HOPE WE COULD GET TO THE

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:32.882
POINT WHERE THIS COMMITTEE IS

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:34.550
LOOKING AT. EVEN POTENTIAL EVEN

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:35.852
THOUGH OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:37.753
THE OVERALL PRISON COST. IF

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:40.423
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.191
MONEY BECAUSE OF EFFECTIVE.

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:43.960
PROGRAMMING ASSISTING PEOPLE

01:02:44.026 --> 01:02:45.761
WHO ARE INSIDE AND HELPING THEM

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:46.996
WITH WITH THEIR NEEDS SO THAT

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:48.331
WHEN THEY COME OUT WORK SEE

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:49.866
RECORD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.501
RECIDIVISM RATES I THINK THAT'S

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:53.703
THE VALUE. THAT WE ALL SHARE

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:55.271
HERE FOR AS LONG AS WE CAN.

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:56.239
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ON THE

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:57.473
SAME PAGE COMMUNICATING IN IN

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:02.345
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT PLAN IS.

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:03.646
ANYONE ELSE MR LACKEY YOUR

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:06.182
QUESTION YEAH. JUST A JUST A

COUPLE COMMENTS- FIRST OF ALL

WE HAVE THIRTY FOUR PRISONS OR

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:11.654
SOMETHING CLOSE TO THAT RIGHT

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:13.623
CORRECT. FELT THE STATE AND

VERY UNIQUE- THEY HAVE UNIQUE

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.261
ENVIRONMENTS AS WELL AS

01:03:18.327 --> 01:03:21.597
POPULATIONS. AND THAT THE

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:22.765
CRITERIA THAT WE WERE TALKING

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:24.467
ABOUT THE NEEDS TO BE

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:26.602
ESTABLISHED ON DETERMINING. AND

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:28.171
EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT-

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:31.574
REDUCING. THE PRISON POPULATION

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.476
IS A LAUDABLE GOAL AND SOME WE-

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:34.644
HOPE THAT THE TREND CONTINUES

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.245
TOWARD. BUT I WILL TELL YOU

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.547
RIGHT NOW THAT THERE ARE NUMBER

01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:39.248
OF PRISONS THAT ARE AND VERY

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:42.552
VERY. A DEPLORABLE CONDITION-

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:44.120
I'M GOING TO MENTION ONE OF

01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:47.957
THEM. PLEASANT VALLEY PRISON- I

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:50.293
HAPPEN TO KNOW. FOR A FACT THAT

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:54.764
WHEN IT RAINS. IT'S DISGUSTING

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:57.500
AND IT'S JUST UNIMAGINABLE THAT

01:03:57.567 --> 01:03:59.502
THAT HAS NOT BEEN TAKING CARE

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:00.503
OF OVER THIS LONG PERIOD OF

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:03.439
TIME AND- I THINK THOSE ARE THE

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:04.073
KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE SHOULD

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:07.109
BE LOOKING AT AND FUNDING-

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:09.579
BECAUSE THE CONDITION NOT ONLY

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:10.813
IMPACTS THE IN MAY BUT ALSO

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.217
EMPLOYEES AND I THINK THAT.

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:15.418
THIS PRESENT REDUCTION SHOULD

01:04:15.484 --> 01:04:17.920
ALSO CONSIDER COMMUNITIES IN

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:20.256
WHICH THE PRISON EXISTS- WE

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.458
SHOULD ALSO AGREED TO CONSIDER

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:25.194
EMPLOYMENT IMPACTS- BY THE

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:27.363
EMPLOYEES AND HOW THEIR LIVES

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:28.164
ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:31.033
THIS DECISION MAKING- AND AS

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.069
WELL AS AS THE INMATE I MEAN AS

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:34.570
YOU WERE JUST INDICATING IT

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:35.771
DOESN'T LIKE WE HAVE A HIGH

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:37.340
VACANCY RATES IN AND OUR

01:04:37.406 --> 01:04:39.008
PRISONS IF I UNDERSTOOD THERE

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:41.477
STILL POPULATION CONCERNS AND

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:42.878
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. MAYBE

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:45.047
EXACERBATING THAT CIRCUMSTANCE

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:45.982
AND I THINK THAT WE JUST NEED

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:47.950
TO BE CAUTIOUS. AND I THINK

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:48.584
THAT SOME OF THESE OTHER

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:50.987
CONCERNS. ARE DESERVING OF OUR

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:53.990
ATTENTION- AND I DON'T KNOW WHY

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:55.157
WE HAVEN'T DONE A BETTER JOB

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:56.959
OF. OF ADDRESSING SOME THESE

01:04:57.026 --> 01:04:58.861
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS BECAUSE

01:04:58.928 --> 01:05:00.563
THEY'RE REALLY REALLY QUITE

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.098
STARK. AND IN MANY THE

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:03.466
CONDITION SOME WAY WORSE THAN

01:05:03.532 --> 01:05:05.234
OTHERS BUT- THE ONE I JUST

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:07.837
MENTIONED AS- IT'S UNIMAGINABLE

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:09.071
THAT THAT SITUATION STILL

01:05:09.138 --> 01:05:11.140
EXISTED SO. I WOULD JUST HOPE

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:12.141
THAT WOULD BE WE WOULD BE VERY

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:13.709
VERY CAUTIOUS AND THE WAY THAT

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:16.078
WE MOVE TOWARD THIS. VERY IT

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:18.247
LAUDABLE GOAL BUT NONETHELESS I

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:21.183
THINK WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:24.053
THE TOTAL PACKAGE AND NOT JUST

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.988
ONE ASPECT. APPRECIATE YOUR

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:27.757
COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AYE

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:29.458
AYE I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:31.260
PLEASANT VALLEY SITUATION I

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:31.694
KNOW THAT THE WARDEN

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:36.432
PERSONALLY- THE ROOF ISSUES AT

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:37.266
THAT INSTITUTIONS AND OTHERS

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:40.236
LIKE IT. THEY STEM FROM. I

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:42.305
THINK- RAMPING BACK UP FROM THE

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:43.406
LEAN TIMES DURING THE TOUGH

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:45.274
BUDGET YEARS- THAT CALIFORNIA

01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:48.778
FACED- AND JUST THE DEFERRED

01:05:48.844 --> 01:05:50.346
MAINTENANCE THAT DID OCCUR IN.

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:51.514
IN ATTEMPTING TO TRY AND GET

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.015
FUNDING FOR THESE LOCATIONS AND

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:54.850
TOUGH YEARS WERE. WRONG PLAN

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:56.819
NOW THAT PLACE- PLEASANT VALLEY

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:58.354
IS FUNDED TO GET THOSE ROOFS

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:00.222
FIX THEIR- THEY ARE IN A BETTER

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:01.924
CONDITION BUT I DO HAVE OTHERS.

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:04.160
THAT WERE BUILT IN SIMILAR

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:06.362
TIMES- I HAVE SOME BURKE

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:08.931
PRISONS BUILT IN THE- EIGHTEEN

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:09.498
HUNDREDS WITH RUSSO BETTER

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:10.566
CONDITION MAYBE IT'S A

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:11.901
DIFFERENT DESIGN OR DIFFERENT

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:16.105
TIMES WHO KNOWS. BUT I'M WELL

01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:17.540
AWARE THAT THE IMPACT IT HAS ON

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:19.809
THE STAFF. IT'S TOUGH ENOUGH TO

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:23.112
GO TO WORK IN A PRISON JUST TO

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:24.780
DO THE THINGS THAT ARE. WITHIN

01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:28.050
THE INTO CATIONS WHERE YOU HAVE.

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:32.421
FOR THEM. THIS IS. A TIMBER BUT

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:33.489
THE- WHAT THE FUNDING THAT WE

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:34.590
DID RECEIVE THE NINETY. IN PRE

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:37.593
A ON GOING. BY MONEY TO

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.395
CONTINUE WITH THOSE REPAIRS-

01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:40.663
AND THE MONEY THAT WE ARE

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.698
ASKING FOR IN THIS BUDGET IS TO

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:46.535
GET HEAD. OF OTHERS OF THE

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:47.103
SITUATION SO WE DON'T HAVE A

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:50.172
PLEASANT VALLEY. NINE FIVE MAKE

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:52.908
ONE QUICK COMMENT SURE THAT. AS

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:54.877
I UNDERSTOOD- I'M NOT A

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:56.979
FINANCIAL PERSON SO BUT I'VE

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:59.548

ADVOCATING THIS FOR MANY YEARS

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.439
I THINK THEY NEED A- MUCH

01:07:23.506 --> 01:07:26.208
LARGER INFUSION AND I. HOPE THE

01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:30.045
BUDGET COMMITTEE WOULD SEE FIT

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:30.946
TO INCREASE THAT AMOUNT. ANY OF

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:35.117

COMMENTS I THINK THE- THE

01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:46.829
CHALLENGE WITH THE-

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:50.733
PRIORITIZATION- OF THE CAPITAL-

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.036
HAS BEEN THE FACT THAT WE-

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:55.271
HAVEN'T RECEIVED A

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:56.705
PRIORITIZATION FROM THE

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:59.141
DEPARTMENT. SO THAT'S BEEN VERY

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:01.010
CHALLENGING SO IT'S A IT'S I

ARE RIGHT ON THE MONEY BET BUT

01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:10.619
PART OF THE CHALLENGES IS

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:13.556
UNLESS WE HAVE A PLAN ON WHICH

01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:15.858
FACILITIES GO FIRST AND WHICH

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:19.795
ONES ARE IN THE- WORST URBAN.

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:21.831
SIGNED OF DISREPAIR AS WELL AS

01:08:21.897 --> 01:08:22.665
WHAT THE PRIORITIES IT'S SORT

01:08:22.731 --> 01:08:24.967
OF HARD FOR US BECAUSE ALL WE

01:08:25.034 --> 01:08:26.836
GET IS A LIST OF THE PEACE. AND

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:28.337
ALL WE CAN TAKE IS ABOUT I

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:28.838
THINK YOUR POINT IS VERY

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:29.905
EXTRAORDINARILY WILL TAKE THEM

01:08:29.972 --> 01:08:31.140
YEAH NOT NOT TO TAKE ANYTHING

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:33.809
AWAY FROM YOUR COMMENT. ON SO

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:34.910
DOUBTS THE SECRETARY THE

01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:37.246
OBVIOUS QUESTION TO WHICH ONE

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:40.115
NEXT AND WHEN WE KNOW. I THINK-

01:08:40.182 --> 01:08:41.584
THAT ATTORNEY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:43.052

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.888
THIS ON THIS ISSUE. AND OUR

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:49.024
DISCUSSIONS- THERE WELL TAKEN

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:50.793

DISMISSED AT ALL BUT I KNOW THE

01:08:52.561 --> 01:08:53.629
ONE QUESTION THAT CONTINUALLY

01:08:53.696 --> 01:08:56.932
COMES UP IS WHICH ONE PLAN- AND

01:08:56.999 --> 01:08:59.702
AS I SAID EARLIER. IT'S NOT AS

01:08:59.768 --> 01:09:02.171
EASY- BUT I RECOGNIZE ASKING

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.105
FOR MONEY AND YOU APPROVING IT

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:04.406
JUST AS AN ATHLETE I RECKON

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:05.774
IT'S NOT EASY TO DO EITHER

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:06.942
BECAUSE I THINK ONE POINT THAT

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:08.277
I TOOK FROM MY CONVERSATIONS

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:09.745
WILL ASSIST TAKE THE- CRC

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:11.814
QUESTION. ABOUT WE'RE SEEKING

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:13.649
SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO REPAIR

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:15.384
WALLS FLOORING SINKS AND FOR

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:17.419
MEDICAL DISTRIBUTION ARIA. BUT

01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:19.154
THAT'S THE ONE THAT'S CURRENTLY

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:20.556
ALWAYS BEEN UP FOR DISCUSSION

01:09:20.623 --> 01:09:23.692
AND YOU KNOW HAS HAS BEEN NOT

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:24.260
HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED THE ONE

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:27.296
THAT'LL CLOSE- I CAN TELL YOU

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:28.497
THAT WAS A SIX MILLION DOLLAR

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.399
REQUESTS BUT FOR NEW BUILDING

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:31.200
IT WOULD'VE BEEN A SEVENTY

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:32.501
MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION WE

01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:33.536
WOULDN'T REQUEST SEVENTY

01:09:33.602 --> 01:09:34.837
MILLION BECAUSE OF THESE

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:36.605
FACTORS LIKE TO DISCUSS-

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:38.774
BECAUSE- IT COULD BE ONE. OR IT

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.409
COULD BE ONE OF THE CENTRAL

01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:46.916
VALLEY COULD. BUT I THINK WE

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:47.783
HAVE TO GET TO A POINT TO WERE

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.885
ONCE WE'RE BACK FROM THE IN

01:09:49.952 --> 01:09:50.486
STATE COMMITTEE CORRECTIONAL

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:52.354
FACILITIES. AS WE SEE THE

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:54.890
POPULATION STE- CONTINUE TO

01:09:54.957 --> 01:09:57.059
DROP BUT THEN ALSO RECOGNIZE

01:09:57.126 --> 01:09:59.261
THAT WERE NOT A STATIC STATE

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:03.132
THINGS CAN HAPPEN. TO MISTER

01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:05.734
SPECTER'S POINT. HE COULD FILE

01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:07.970
A LAWSUIT AND COULD STORE SEND

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:10.439
A PROPER CRY BUT BUT BUT- HE-

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:13.342
MORE REASON. TO A PLAN. RIGHT I

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:15.077
MEAN YOU YOU YOU JUST HEARD ARE

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:16.612
MY CALLING ASKED VERY SPOKE

ABOUT A PARTICULAR. AND IN A

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:22.017
ROOF. COM I WISH I COULD I WISH

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:23.218
WE COULD ALL SAY WELL THAT.

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:25.588
THAT FACILITY RANKS NUMBER

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:26.689
THREE OR NUMBER THIRTY AND

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:28.424
THESE ARE THE REASONS WHY THAT

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:31.660
ROOF HASN'T BEEN. REPAIR RIGHT

01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:33.796
I THINK THAT WOULD BE. READ

01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:34.597
THAT THAT WOULD HAVE A LEAST

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:38.601
SOME RESERVE VERSES ON. WE'RE

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:40.269
WORKING ON OUR GUESS THAT

01:10:40.336 --> 01:10:41.337

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:50.292
THE IS. GOOD FOR SEDUCTIVE

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:52.260
EFFECTS. I IT'S BASED ON THE

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:53.962
NEED THAT COME WHAT HAVE FOUND

01:18:54.029 --> 01:18:55.664
IS THE LEAN TIMES OF THE BUDGET

01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:59.734
THAT WAS NO. PLAN TO YOU KNOW

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:01.603
SICK ON GOING FOR JUST REPAIR

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:02.170
THEY WERE ALWAYS OTHER EVEN

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:03.472
ISSUE THAT WERE COMING UP

01:19:03.538 --> 01:19:07.309
RIPARIAN. BUT BUT I GUESS IS

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:09.778
THAT MEAN THAT IS. WHAT THOSE

01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:15.050
GET SUBMITTED IS THAT. YOU HAVE

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:17.185
WE HAVE WITH SOME HELP OR

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:25.927
GUIDANCE. THE ANSWERS. LET YOU

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:27.896
LOOK OVER MUCH WHAT I DON'T I

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:29.998
DON'T I DON'T WHAT I APOLOGIZE

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:48.016
THE. AND JUSTICE. HI CLOSER TO.

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:52.988
IF I. HAVE A TWO YEAR ROLLOUT

01:19:53.054 --> 01:19:55.790
SO THIS BUDGET INCLUDES FUNDING

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:56.825
FOR DESIGN AND THEN THE NEXT

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:58.059
YEAR INCLUDES MONEY FOR

01:19:58.126 --> 01:20:00.529
CONSTRUCTION AND SO OVER THE

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:03.064
NEXT ABOUT TEN YEARS WE HAVE

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:04.432
THE SEVEN PHASES WERE WE'VE

01:20:04.499 --> 01:20:06.234
ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED WHICH OF

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:09.137
THE RIVER PLACES WILL BE DONE

01:20:09.204 --> 01:20:11.873
OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME. AND

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:12.407
HOW DO YOU HOW DO THEY GET

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:15.710
PRIORITIZE. I'M AS THE

01:20:15.777 --> 01:20:17.112
SECRETARY MENTIONED I THINK IT

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:18.513
HAS A LOT TO DO WITH KIND OF

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:21.349
THE STEP AT THE STATUS OF THAT

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:22.684
INFRASTRUCTURE SO WHEN WE'VE

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:24.819
GOT ROOF WHERE WE'VE GOT LEAKY

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:26.421
BUT IT'S- THERE'S A PUBLIC

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.356
SAFETY CONCERN THOSE ARE

01:20:28.423 --> 01:20:29.324
GENERALLY RISING TO THE TOP OF

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:30.559
THE LAST. BUT I WOULD ALSO

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:32.427
MENTION THAT THE- THE

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:34.563
DEPARTMENT HAS AN ONGOING BASS

01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:36.831
LINE A SPECIAL REPAIR FUNDING

01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:37.899
AND SO WHILE WE'VE GOT THIS

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:39.134
SEVEN YEAR ROLL OUT THERE'S

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:40.702
ALSO THE SPECIAL PERFORMANCE OF

01:20:40.769 --> 01:20:41.736
WE'VE GOT OTHER ISSUES THAT

01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:42.938
COME UP AT SOME OF THESE

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:44.639
INSTITUTIONS THAT MAY RATE RISE

01:20:44.706 --> 01:20:46.074
TO THE LEVEL. RATHER THAN

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:47.008
WAITING FOR THE NEW BUDGET

01:20:47.075 --> 01:20:48.677
PROCESS WE'VE GOT THAT ONGOING

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:49.578
BASICALLY FUNDING THE COULD

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:51.012
ALSO BE CONTRIBUTE TO THOSE

01:20:51.079 --> 01:20:52.681
PERSONS ARTS TO THOSE REFER

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:54.849
PLACEMENTS ONE THICKER MY

01:20:54.916 --> 01:20:59.454
FEELING IS LOOK WE HAVE THESE

01:20:59.521 --> 01:20:59.988
HOME. SEPARATE FUNDS FOR A

01:21:00.055 --> 01:21:00.855
MERGER FOR MANY OF THE

01:21:00.922 --> 01:21:01.823
DEPARTMENTS FOR MANY OF THE

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:04.059
ISSUES AND CAL CAL FIRE COMES

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:06.661
TO MIND- IN TERMS OF SORT OF

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:07.495
APPROPRIATIONS WERE MONEY GETS

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:08.863
APPROPRIATE WE ARE OUT OF

01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:10.232
SESSION BECAUSE OF EMERGENCIES

01:21:10.298 --> 01:21:11.900
AND WE'VE- OBVIOUSLY HAD A

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:12.901
QUITE A FEW CAL FIRE

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:16.338
EMERGENCIES OVER THE LAST HERE-

01:21:16.404 --> 01:21:17.973
WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:19.574
DEPARTMENT COULD GET GREATER

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:23.712
FLEXIBILITY. AND FREEDOM IF. I

01:21:23.778 --> 01:21:25.347
AM PUT FORWARD. THERE WAS A

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:28.750
METHOD. AND A PIRATE STATED TO

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:30.919
STATION PUT FORWARD. THAT WE

01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:34.623
CAN ALL AGREE ON SO THEN. WE

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:37.759
WOULD HAVE TO TRY TO DECIPHER

01:21:37.826 --> 01:21:39.861
ON THE PC PEAS ARE COMING

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:42.230
FORWARD AS WELL AS- HAVE TO NIT

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:45.200
PICK OVER EVERY SINGLE ITEM. OM

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:47.035
I THINK GOING BACK TO- I THINK

01:21:47.102 --> 01:21:49.004
MIX MISTER SPECTER'S EARLIER

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.871
POINT AND ONE OF THE REASONS

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:53.208
WHY- THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN I

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:56.811
THINK RED ISN'T TOO- JUST WRITE

01:21:56.878 --> 01:22:00.448
THE CHECK FOR- IN ALL THE

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:03.151
REPAIRS IS BECAUSE- WE KEEP

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:08.189
WAITING FOR. WHICH WHICH

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:10.425
POTENTIAL FACILITIES MAY BE UP

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:12.360
FOR CLOSURE SUCH I GUESS ONE

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:14.229
QUESTION IS INSTRUCTORS CAN YOU

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:15.764
GUARANTEE TO THE COMMITTEE THAT

01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:17.532
YOU WON'T BE BRINGING FORWARD

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:21.002
ANY BCP'S OF ANY FACILITIES

01:22:21.069 --> 01:22:22.237
THAT WILL BE PROPOSED FOR

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:23.638
CLOSURE BECAUSE THE LAST THING

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:24.372
WE'D LIKE TO DO IS PUT A NEW

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:25.940
ROOF ON A FACILITY THEY GO TEAR

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:28.009
DOWN TWO YEARS LATER OR HAVE A

01:22:28.076 --> 01:22:29.177
NEW ROOF ON OFFICIALLY THAT

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:31.346
EMPTY AGAINST YOUR MEDICAL TERM

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:34.149
DOWN. I CANNOT I CANNOT GIVE I

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:35.383
CAN GIVE I CANNOT GUARANTEE

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:36.718
THAT TO THE COMMITTEE RIGHT SO

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:38.420
UNTIL YOU CAN GUARANTEE THAT

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:38.920
THAT IT'S MAKES IT VERY

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:42.057
DIFFICULT TO APPROPRIATE THESE

01:22:42.123 --> 01:22:44.326
RESOURCES ON YEAH BECAUSE WHY

01:22:44.392 --> 01:22:45.894
WHY WOULD I YOU KNOW GIVE YOU

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.163
MONEY TO FIX THE CAR AND THEN

01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.763
SAID TO THE JUNK YARD THE NEXT

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:50.799
DAY. AND WE GOT LONG LONG LIST

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:52.901
OF CARS SOME THAT NEED TO BE

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:56.438
FIXED. I UNDERSTAND AND IT'S- I

01:22:56.504 --> 01:22:57.539
JUST WANT TO LET THE COMMITTEE

01:22:57.605 --> 01:22:59.474
KNOW THAT THERE IS NO INTENT TO

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:01.009
TRYING TO SAY HI. WE'RE NOT

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:02.410
GOING TO CLOSE THE STATE PRISON

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:03.078
BECAUSE THAT IN THE END THAT'S

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:04.679
OUR GOAL. THAT IS ALL OF OUR

01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:06.548
GOAL TO REHABILITATE TO LOWER

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:08.216
PRISON POPULATION TO MAKE SAFER

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:10.185
COMMUNITIES. BUT WHEN IT COMES

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:11.853
TO THE QUESTION OF CLOTHES IN A

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.724
PARTICULAR PRISON- THE IT'S NOT

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:17.025
AS EASY AS ONE WOULD THINK AND

01:23:17.092 --> 01:23:17.892
WE ARE HAVING INTERNET

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:18.993
DISCUSSIONS THAT THEY ARE

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.428
TRYING TO STAY WITHIN THE

01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:22.030
SPIRIT OF TWENTY SIXTY SEVEN

01:23:22.097 --> 01:23:23.631
AND- CREATING A LIST BASED ON

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:25.033
INFORMATION FROM THE TOLL PLAZA

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:26.501
STUDIES AND OTHERS. THAT WE

01:23:26.568 --> 01:23:28.803
KNOW IT'S COMPLICATED EVEN MORE

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:30.605
REASON TO HAVE A PLAN. I DON'T

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:32.140
I DON'T THINK. YOU'VE HEARD

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:33.675
ANYBODY UP HERE SAYING THAT A

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:34.743
STOCK COMPANY ABSOLUTELY

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:36.544
BELIEVE IT'S COMPLICATED BUT-

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:37.879
EVEN MORE REASON TO HAVE

01:23:37.946 --> 01:23:38.847
CRITERIA AND EVEN MORE REASON

01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:41.449
TO HAVE A PLAN. NO ONE'S

01:23:41.516 --> 01:23:42.283
ARGUING THE EIGHTEEN MONTH TIME

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:44.719
FRAME. BUT I THINK WHAT WE WHAT

01:23:44.786 --> 01:23:46.721
WE ARE ARGUING AS WE DON'T WANT

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:49.157
TO BE WASTING. VERY PRECIOUS

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:51.259
TAXPAYER RESOURCES. BECAUSE YOU

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:54.429
CHANGE YOUR MIND. SOLD THAT'S

01:23:54.496 --> 01:23:56.398
NOT OKAY MOVIE WE HAVE MANY

01:23:56.464 --> 01:23:57.665
OTHER THINGS THAT WE NEED TO

01:23:57.732 --> 01:23:59.234
SPEND THE MONEY WE HAVE HE A

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:00.835
PRESCHOOL FACILITY GOT

01:24:00.902 --> 01:24:02.137
KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES WE

01:24:02.203 --> 01:24:04.506
HAVE. ON RECREATIONAL CELLS

01:24:04.572 --> 01:24:06.908
WITH HEALTH FACILITIES THIS IS

01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:07.442
NOT THE ONLY GAME IN THIS

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:10.345
BUDGET SO SUGGESTS JUST SWITCH

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:11.413
THE TOPIC HAS COME BACK TO

01:24:11.479 --> 01:24:13.248
FINANCE FOR SECOND THAT'S ONE

01:24:13.314 --> 01:24:15.183
TO CLARIFY WHAT ON. FINANCE IT

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:17.352
ON THE ABILITY XIN WHICH IS.

01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:19.020
YOU MENTION THAT THE INCREASES

01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:20.121
SPENDING WITH ABOUT THREE

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:21.322
HUNDRED MILLION TO ABOUT FIVE

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:23.158
HUNDRED MILLION OF CAP OVER

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:26.528
WHAT TIME FRAME THE WAS. SO

01:24:26.594 --> 01:24:28.430
EVER EXPECT TO SPEND FIVE OR

01:24:28.496 --> 01:24:29.130
FIFTY THREE MILLION IN TWENTY

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:32.033
TWENTY ONE. I COMPARED TO THREE

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.201
MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:37.872
THIRTEEN. OKAY THE END CAN. CAN

01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:40.708
YOU TALK ABOUT THE- RECIDIVISM

01:24:40.775 --> 01:24:43.211
RATE- IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:24:43.278 --> 01:24:45.947
TWELVE ON WARES TODAY I DON'T

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:46.514
HAVE INFORMATION ON ME BUT I

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:49.684
CAN. SO YOU SO YOU INCREASE

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.085
SPENDING TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:52.687
DOLLAR ORDER PROPOSED TO DO IT

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:54.456
IN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:24:54.522 --> 01:24:55.657
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:24:55.723 --> 01:24:58.259
WHAT WHAT IMPROVEMENTS IN

01:24:58.326 --> 01:25:00.328
RECIDIVISM HAVE OCCURRED TO

01:25:00.395 --> 01:25:02.096
THAT SPEND ANOTHER ARMY BUT

01:25:02.163 --> 01:25:03.798
CAN DEFINITELY GET ABOUT BACK

01:25:03.865 --> 01:25:08.269
TO WHEN I. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:09.504
SECRETARY HAD PARTY NO THE

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:10.438
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IS

01:25:10.505 --> 01:25:11.973
WORKING. I WOULD SAY THAT THE

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.708
MOST RECENT RECIDIVISM NUMBERS

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:16.010
ARE THERE THEY STAYED PRETTY

01:25:16.077 --> 01:25:18.146
MUCH THE SAME FORTY SIX FOUR

01:25:18.213 --> 01:25:19.147
SIX POINT OF THINGS FOR SIX

01:25:19.214 --> 01:25:22.217
POINT FOUR. I THINK THAT'S IT

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:24.185
FOR SIX THIRSTING FOR CUT TWO

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:24.986
HUNDRED MILLION UNDER SAID

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:26.020
ABOUT AND THAT THEY COULD THESE

01:25:26.087 --> 01:25:27.422
REPORT NUMBERS FROM THREE YEARS

01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:29.357
PRIOR. TO THAT SO WE'RE DEALING

01:25:29.424 --> 01:25:31.092
WITH THOSE NUMBERS AS AS A

01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:33.328
COURT COMES OUT WE ARE. STILL

01:25:33.394 --> 01:25:33.862
WAITING TO SEE WHAT THESE

01:25:33.928 --> 01:25:35.630
INVESTMENTS CUT PAN OUT IN THE

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:37.031
NEXT COHORTOF RECIDIVISM

01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:39.934
NUMBERS BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING

01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:41.002
THREE YEARS PASS AS WE DEVELOP

01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:41.903
THE COHORT NUMBERS FOR

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.538
RECIDIVISM YES WHAT WE'RE HERE

01:25:43.605 --> 01:25:45.406
LAST YEAR WE HAD THIS. SUMMER

01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:46.975
CONVERSATION AROUND RECIDIVISM

01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:51.145
SO- WHAT THE QUESTIONS I HAD

01:25:51.212 --> 01:25:54.449
ASKED IS SORT OF. HOW TO TRACK

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:56.751
THE PROGRESS BY IN MAY SO

01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:58.553
WANTED TO JUST HEAR AFTER

01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.821
TWELVE MONTHS. HAVE MADE ANY

01:25:59.888 --> 01:26:02.223
PROGRESS ON BEING ABLE TO TRACK

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:05.693
THE PROGRESS PER IN MAY. IF WE

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.160
LOOK AT THE GAINS OF

ONLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF

01:31:58.613 --> 01:31:59.046

TAKES TO ASSIGN INMATES TO

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:27.675
VARIOUS JOBS PROGRAMS BASED ON

01:32:27.742 --> 01:32:29.410

01:32:48.262 --> 01:32:51.198
THAT IF AN INMATE ON A YARD-

01:32:51.265 --> 01:32:53.434
COULD FILL A VACANCY ON DELTA

01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:56.771
FACILITY. I THINK JUST. FOR

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:57.338
CONVERSATION YEAH THAT'S AN

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:59.206
EASY THING TO DO BUT THERE ARE

01:32:59.273 --> 01:33:00.441
CONCERNS THAT THEY MADE ON THAT

01:33:00.508 --> 01:33:02.443
FACILITY CANNOT FOR HIS OWN

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:04.712
SAFETY OR THE SAFETY OF OTHERS

01:33:04.779 --> 01:33:06.414
PROGRAM ON THAT FACILITY NO

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.415
THAT'S THE ONLY THAT'S QUESTION

01:33:07.481 --> 01:33:10.584
AUDITED THE QUESTION IS IF THE

01:33:10.651 --> 01:33:14.088
INMATES AND DELTA YARD HAVE A

01:33:14.155 --> 01:33:15.556
LAW LIBRARY HOW COME BUT THEY

01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:16.691
WANT ACCESS TO THE AUTOBODY

01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:19.126
SHOP HOW CAN THEY CAN GET

01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:20.895
ACCESS TO THE ABACHA. I'M I'M

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:22.330
NOT UNDER. WHO YOU HAD AUTO

01:33:22.396 --> 01:33:24.765
BODY SHOP SALINE YARD. YOU KNOW

01:33:24.832 --> 01:33:29.103
OUR YARD HEY. AND YOU GOT

01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:30.504
INMATES ON YARD THAT WANNA ACT.

01:33:30.571 --> 01:33:32.106
THE COURSES ON YOUR DAY THEY

01:33:32.173 --> 01:33:34.375
CAN'T DO THAT THE FACILITY. IF

01:33:34.442 --> 01:33:36.143
THERE ARE. FOR WHATEVER

01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:37.578
CUSTODIAL NEED ARE CONCERNED

01:33:37.645 --> 01:33:39.880
THAT EXISTS THAT HE CANNOT BE

01:33:39.947 --> 01:33:41.849
PLACED IN THAT FACILITY THEIR

01:33:41.916 --> 01:33:43.651
HOUSE THEIR BASE FOR VARIOUS

01:33:43.718 --> 01:33:44.785
REASONS THERE WILL COME A DAY

01:33:44.852 --> 01:33:46.487
AND I HOPE THE DAY WILL COME TO

01:33:46.554 --> 01:33:48.255
WHERE I CAN. HOUSE ALL INMATES

01:33:48.322 --> 01:33:50.891
TOGETHER. AND MAKING SURE SAME

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:52.560
FACILITIES AND THE THERE'S NO

01:33:52.626 --> 01:33:55.162
RISK OF VIOLENCE OR- FLOOR NO

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:56.263
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT EVEN

01:33:56.330 --> 01:33:57.832
INTERMINGLING YOUR YOUR MISSED

01:33:57.898 --> 01:33:59.367
THE POINT AGAIN AGAIN THE THAT

01:33:59.433 --> 01:34:01.535
THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU HAVE.

01:34:01.602 --> 01:34:05.940
INDIVIDUAL CLASSROOMS TIED TO

01:34:06.007 --> 01:34:08.409
INDIVIDUAL YARDS CORRECT. IN

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:12.980
SEOUL ONLY 25% OF THE INMATES

01:34:13.047 --> 01:34:15.516
COULD ACTUALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE.

01:34:15.583 --> 01:34:18.452
OF THOSE CLASSROOMS 25% OF THE

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:20.054
INMATES OF THE WHOLE OF THE

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:21.222
WHOLE OF THE WHOLE PRISON YEAH

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:22.823
THE WHOLE PRISON SO FROM

01:34:22.890 --> 01:34:26.594
FACILITIES EIGHT A D. ONLY 25%

01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:29.964
CAN ACCESS EIGHT YARDS. AT AND

01:34:30.031 --> 01:34:31.098
FOR THAT REASON I SPOKE ABOUT

01:34:31.165 --> 01:34:32.767
EARLIER THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS

01:34:32.833 --> 01:34:34.635
REASONS WHY THEY CANNOT AT THAT

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:36.404
FACILITY IS NOT A SHARED.

01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:38.706
SHARED USE FACILITY. NO I

01:34:38.773 --> 01:34:40.307
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I THINK

01:34:40.374 --> 01:34:44.712
THAT THE CHALLENGES IS THAT. ON.

01:34:44.779 --> 01:34:49.517
IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THE

01:34:49.583 --> 01:34:51.118
AGAIN AND AGAIN I'M I'M LOOKING

01:34:51.185 --> 01:34:52.620
A BIG PROPONENT OF

01:34:52.686 --> 01:34:54.755
REHABILITATION DONE CORRECTLY I

01:34:54.822 --> 01:34:56.724
THINK WHAT'S CONCERNING IS

01:34:56.791 --> 01:34:58.259
GOING BACK TO THE DISCUSSION WE

01:34:58.325 --> 01:35:01.162
JUST HAD A CAPITAL IS THAT THE

01:35:01.228 --> 01:35:05.032
DEPARTMENT. COM DOESN'T HAVE A

01:35:05.099 --> 01:35:07.902
SYSTEMIC WAY. OF BEING ABLE TO

01:35:07.968 --> 01:35:09.670
TRACK THE PROGRESS SO EVEN IF

01:35:09.737 --> 01:35:10.671
THE AGAIN EVEN F THE

01:35:10.738 --> 01:35:12.440
RECIDIVIST NUMBERS I YOU KNOW

01:35:12.506 --> 01:35:14.875
ARE.ARE THE SAME OR EVEN LET'S

01:35:14.942 --> 01:35:17.311
SAY HIGHER. BUT IF YOU COULD

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:21.148
SEE ROGRESS BY INDIVIDUAL YOU

01:35:21.215 --> 01:35:23.184
WOULD HOPE. THAT AT SOME POINT

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:24.952
THOSE NUMBERS WOULD GO DOWN. I

01:35:25.019 --> 01:35:26.987
THINK THE CHALLENGE IS RIGHT

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:29.590
NOW THOSE RECIDIVISM NUMB BUT

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:31.459
THAT THAT THAT TRACKING.

01:35:31.525 --> 01:35:33.160
DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE LEVEL OF

01:35:33.227 --> 01:35:36.230
DETAIL THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT

01:35:36.297 --> 01:35:41.469
WITH THAT SIZABLE INVESTMENT.

01:35:41.535 --> 01:35:42.670
SO I MEAN IT'S UP TO MAYBE IT'S

01:35:42.736 --> 01:35:44.238
JUST YOU KNOW WE NEED TO GET

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:47.508
TOGETHER AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IS

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:49.243
BEING TRACKED AND WHAT'S NOT

01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:51.545
BUT BASED ON AGAIN YOU KNOW

01:35:51.612 --> 01:35:54.215
I'VE ONLY VISITED A COUPLE OUR

01:35:54.281 --> 01:35:55.816
OUR BUDGET TEAM IS VISITED A

01:35:55.883 --> 01:36:01.088
LOT MORE ON. THERE IS THE-

01:36:01.155 --> 01:36:05.359
THERE IS NOT THE CORRELATION

01:36:05.426 --> 01:36:07.361
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE FROM

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:09.997
THE INCREASE IN SPENDING TO THE

01:36:10.064 --> 01:36:13.000
LEVEL OF TRACKING TO THE LEVEL

01:36:13.067 --> 01:36:14.802
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT OFFERING

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:15.369
MORE COURSES I THINK YOU ARE

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:18.372
FROM OF COURSE. I DON'T THINK

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:20.941
IT'S BECAUSE THE COURSES. OUR

01:36:21.008 --> 01:36:23.844
BAD CONNECTION I DIED I HAVE I

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:24.879
HAVE A REASON TO BELIEVE I WAS

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:26.480
GIVE THAT WITHOUT THE PROGRAM

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:29.049
IS GOOD. OR ARE RELATIVELY

01:36:29.116 --> 01:36:30.918
SPEAKING YOU KNOW GOOD GOOD

01:36:30.985 --> 01:36:35.156
IT'S- THAT THE PROGRAMMING IS

01:36:35.222 --> 01:36:37.091
ADEQUATE TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL. I

01:36:37.158 --> 01:36:41.762
THINK. A MAJOR PROBLEM IS.

01:36:41.829 --> 01:36:43.864
WHETHER OR NOT THE INMATES ARE

01:36:43.931 --> 01:36:45.699
BEING PLACED IN THE RIGHT

01:36:45.766 --> 01:36:48.302
CLASSES AT THE RIGHT TIME. IN

01:36:48.369 --> 01:36:50.471
THE RIGHT ORDER TO ACHIEVE

01:36:50.538 --> 01:36:53.807
THEIR AND CALL. I BELIEVE THE

01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:55.309
PLANE BEING PLACE AT THE RIGHT

01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:56.777
TIME AT THE RIGHT PLACE ON THE

01:36:56.844 --> 01:37:01.282
RIGHT FACILITY. WHAT WAS I'M

01:37:01.348 --> 01:37:02.149
SORRY WHAT WHAT IS THAT BUT IS

01:37:02.216 --> 01:37:03.417
THAT WHAT THAT MEANS IS TO

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:04.919
ORIGINAL POINT TO WHAT WHY

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:06.987
CAN'T AN INMATE ON FACILITY A

01:37:07.054 --> 01:37:07.888
ACCESS THE CLASSROOM FACILITY

01:37:07.955 --> 01:37:10.457
DE. THE END MADE UP OCILLA GA

01:37:10.524 --> 01:37:11.926
HE IS ABLE TO ACCESS THE

01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:13.527
PROGRAMS ASSIGNED TO HIM AT

01:37:13.594 --> 01:37:14.895
THAT RIGHT TIME BASED ON HIS

01:37:14.962 --> 01:37:16.697
REHABILITATIVE NEEDS. ON THAT

01:37:16.764 --> 01:37:19.867
FACILITY GOD. IN SO IF THAT.

01:37:19.934 --> 01:37:21.535
INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OTHER THINGS

01:37:21.602 --> 01:37:23.404
THAT ARE BEING OFFERED AT THAT

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:24.972
PARTICULAR YARD THEY JUST

01:37:25.039 --> 01:37:26.607
AREN'T GETTING THEM. I THINK AT

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:28.175
SOME POINT WE SEEK TO SEE IF

01:37:28.242 --> 01:37:29.443
THERE'S ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:31.345
HOUSING FOR HIM THAT MEET HIS

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:33.480
NEED. THAT CAN'T LET THAT'S

01:37:33.547 --> 01:37:35.616
COMMENSURATE WITH HIS MENTAL

01:37:35.683 --> 01:37:37.551
HEALTH MEDICAL. SECURITY

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:39.987
CONCERNS. MAYBE AT ANOTHER

01:37:40.054 --> 01:37:41.956
FACILITY WE HAVE OVER WRITTEN.

01:37:42.022 --> 01:37:44.358
THOUSANDS OF INMATES DOWN. TO

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:46.260
LEVELS SO THEY CAN GAIN ACCESS

01:37:46.327 --> 01:37:48.229
TO THESE PROGRAMS WE HAVE BEGAN

01:37:48.295 --> 01:37:49.697
WORKING OUTSIDE OF OUR NORMAL

01:37:49.763 --> 01:37:51.432
OPERATION SECURITY CONCERNS OF

01:37:51.498 --> 01:37:53.200
AN INMATE HASN'T RECEIVED

01:37:53.267 --> 01:37:55.236
DISPONER HISTORY BUT YET IT'S

01:37:55.302 --> 01:37:55.769
STILL TRADITIONALLY HIGHER

01:37:55.836 --> 01:37:57.738
LEVEL. WE WILL HOUSE AMONG THE

01:37:57.805 --> 01:37:59.640
FACILITY FOR HIS NEEDS CAN BE

01:37:59.707 --> 01:38:02.409
MET. SO WE HAVE GONE BEYOND TO

01:38:02.476 --> 01:38:03.777
THINK DIFFERENTLY TO ADDRESS

01:38:03.844 --> 01:38:04.979
THE CONCERN THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT

01:38:05.045 --> 01:38:06.580
THINGS LIKE HOW COME HE CAN'T

01:38:06.647 --> 01:38:08.916
ACCESS A PROGRAM ON ANOTHER

01:38:08.983 --> 01:38:10.951
YARD. WE HAVE TO HOUSE MONEY

01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:12.353
FACILITY THAT'S COMMENSURATE

01:38:12.419 --> 01:38:14.655
WITH HIS CURRENT NEEDS. AS TO

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:16.824
NOT. PUT IN THIS SITUATION WAS

01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:18.626
BAD FOR HIM OR HER. RIGHT BUILT

01:38:18.692 --> 01:38:20.794
THAT IS THE ULTIMATE PRIORITY

01:38:20.861 --> 01:38:25.733
AGAIN IS THE. THE PROTECTION OF

01:38:25.799 --> 01:38:27.534
HARM THIS INDIVIDUAL MAY OR MAY

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.436
NOT COSTS RELATIVE TO THE

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:32.139
PERSON'S REHABILITATION. I

01:38:32.206 --> 01:38:34.375
THINK THAT'S ALL OF OUR CONCERN

01:38:34.441 --> 01:38:34.842
I THINK THIS SHOULD BE

01:38:34.908 --> 01:38:36.710
EVERYONE'S CONCERN YEAH. BUT

01:38:36.777 --> 01:38:40.848
BUT I GUESS. MY CONCERN ABOUT

01:38:40.914 --> 01:38:42.316
THIS PARTICULAR ITEM IS WE'VE

01:38:42.383 --> 01:38:44.151
INVESTED TWO HUNDRED MORE

01:38:44.218 --> 01:38:45.119
ADDITIONAL DOLLARS I THINK THIS

01:38:45.185 --> 01:38:47.388
COMMITTEE- PREVIOUS GOVERNOR

01:38:47.454 --> 01:38:49.156
THIS GOVERNOR HAVE KIND OF

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:49.723
STEPPED UP AND ON THEIR PART

01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:51.525
AND SAID HEY YOU GOT BASICALLY

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:54.228
ALMOST DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF

01:38:54.295 --> 01:38:56.030
REHABILITATION FUNDING THAT.

01:38:56.096 --> 01:39:01.368
THAT TOM YOU HAD FROM BEFORE.

01:39:01.435 --> 01:39:01.969
IN THERE THE REASON YOU KNOW

01:39:02.036 --> 01:39:04.038
I'M I'M SORT OF THE LABOR THIS

01:39:04.104 --> 01:39:07.741
POINT IS THIS TO ME IS THAT THE

01:39:07.808 --> 01:39:10.210
KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THE

01:39:10.277 --> 01:39:13.247
DEPARTMENT. IS WHETHER THE

01:39:13.314 --> 01:39:16.183
DEPARTMENT REALLY HOUSE AND

01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:17.551
ABILITY TO IMPROVE SOME

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:20.954
INDIVIDUALS LIKE. RIGHT IS HE

01:39:21.021 --> 01:39:22.256
YOUR ARE YOU JUST WERE HOUSING

01:39:22.323 --> 01:39:24.091
SOME INDIVIDUAL IN TAKEN TIME

01:39:24.158 --> 01:39:26.960
OFF THEIR LIFE OR IT IS

01:39:27.027 --> 01:39:29.530
ACTUALLY THE GOAL TO. IMPROVE

01:39:29.596 --> 01:39:32.232
THEIR LIFE. THAT WHEN THEY COME

01:39:32.299 --> 01:39:34.234
FOR HOWEVER LONG THEY COME FOR

01:39:34.301 --> 01:39:37.071
THAT THEIR LIFE IS IMPROVED.

01:39:37.137 --> 01:39:40.374
AND I KNOW IT SOUNDS- PERHAPS

01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:41.542
POLLYANNA SHORT LITTLE BASS

01:39:41.608 --> 01:39:44.645
PROVISIONAL- BUT ALL SPEND IT A

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:47.114
DIFFERENT WAY I MEAN I WILL SAY

COULD BE A LITTLE BIT

01:42:44.725 --> 01:42:46.426
DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THEIR

PRESENT. SO I'M SAYING TO

MYSELF OKAY IF I JUST AND I'M

01:47:36.016 --> 01:47:37.384
NOT THE ONE THAT'S INFORMED IF

01:47:37.450 --> 01:47:38.218
I'M JUST LOOKING AT BECAUSE

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:39.386
THEY WOULD DO I NEED FIVE OF

01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:41.188
THOSE LITTLE ANY THREE OF THEM.

01:47:41.254 --> 01:47:42.389
TWENTY TWO OF THEM. YOU KNOW DO

01:47:42.455 --> 01:47:43.723
THEY WORK WELL WITH THIS SYSTEM

01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:44.858
VERSES THAT SYSTEM. MY

01:47:44.925 --> 01:47:46.927
ASSUMPTION IS YOU KNOW THAT ALL

THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE

01:47:47.794 --> 01:47:49.996
OFFICE KNOWS THAT. SO IF WE

01:47:50.063 --> 01:47:52.165
WERE TALKING ABOUT NEEDS AND

01:47:52.232 --> 01:47:54.434
MAKING SURE THAT. IF WE IF WE

01:47:54.501 --> 01:47:56.403
WERE TO CLOSE A PRISON. OF THAT

01:47:56.469 --> 01:47:57.470
THOSE NEEDS ARE STILL BEING

01:47:57.537 --> 01:47:59.573
MET- IT WOULD SEEM TO BE

01:47:59.639 --> 01:48:01.041
LOGICAL THAT THAT WOULD BE A

01:48:01.107 --> 01:48:02.776
PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT.

01:48:02.843 --> 01:48:04.144
WE HAVE TO HAVE EXT NUMBER

01:48:04.211 --> 01:48:05.779
SERVICES EXT OF A MENTAL HEALTH

01:48:05.846 --> 01:48:08.148
BILLS BATES WHATEVER IT IS. SO

01:48:08.215 --> 01:48:08.748
THAT AS WELL AS YOU'RE TALKING

01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:10.617
ABOUT- OF GETTING RID OF SOME

01:48:10.684 --> 01:48:11.918
OF THE OLDER PRISONS THE ONES

01:48:11.985 --> 01:48:13.820
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO

01:48:13.887 --> 01:48:16.289
REPAIR ANYMORE- THAT THAT WOULD

01:48:16.356 --> 01:48:17.390
BE. A VERY BOLD SOMETHING THAT

01:48:17.457 --> 01:48:19.526
WE WOULD LOOK AT. OF CLOSING

01:48:19.593 --> 01:48:20.760
THE PRISON AS A NO WILL BE A

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:22.229
VERY DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE

01:48:22.295 --> 01:48:23.530
EVERYBODY I'VE BEEN HAD MEMBERS

01:48:23.597 --> 01:48:25.065
ALREADY. TELL ME THEY WANT THE

01:48:25.131 --> 01:48:27.000
PRISONS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:48:27.067 --> 01:48:28.835
OF THEY WANT TO- TO KEEP THEM.

01:48:28.902 --> 01:48:31.104
THERE THAT NOT THE MAJOR ONES

01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:31.771
BUT THE ONES THAT THEY'RE

01:48:31.838 --> 01:48:33.673
USING. IN THE SMALLER CITIES

01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:35.442
THAT THAT HANDLE THE OVERFLOW

01:48:35.508 --> 01:48:36.676
THAT DON'T PROVIDE.

01:48:36.743 --> 01:48:38.011
REHABILITATIVE KIND OF SERVICES

01:48:38.078 --> 01:48:39.145
WE THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE.

01:48:39.212 --> 01:48:40.180
THAT'S GONNA BE A MAJOR ISSUE

01:48:40.247 --> 01:48:41.281
BECAUSE THERE'S SOME MEMBERS.

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:43.183
WAY DR ECONOMY OF THAT

01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:45.452
COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW WE AT THAT

01:48:45.518 --> 01:48:46.887
THAT IS A CONSIDERATION BUT IT

01:48:46.953 --> 01:48:47.687
CAN'T BE THE MAJOR

01:48:47.754 --> 01:48:49.222
CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:48:49.289 --> 01:48:50.924
WHAT FACILITIES WE KEEP. UP

01:48:50.991 --> 01:48:53.026
BECAUSE EVERY. ALL EVERY PRISON

01:48:53.093 --> 01:48:57.063
HAS A POPULATION. OF PEOPLE

01:48:57.130 --> 01:48:57.664
THAT THEY EMPLOY. AT AND THEY

01:48:57.731 --> 01:48:58.431
FOR. INTO THE ECON OF THEIR

01:48:58.498 --> 01:49:01.034
COMMUNITY. SO YOU KNOW WE CAN'T

01:49:01.101 --> 01:49:02.669
SAY OKAY WE CAN'T BECAUSE IN

01:49:02.736 --> 01:49:04.137
THAT CASE WE SHUT NOTHING DOWN.

01:49:04.204 --> 01:49:05.305
AND I KNOW THAT'S A BIG ISSUE

01:49:05.372 --> 01:49:06.406
EVEN WITH THE MILITARY WHEN

01:49:06.473 --> 01:49:07.574
THEY'VE CLOSED DOWN THINGS AS

01:49:07.641 --> 01:49:09.276
ALWAYS ALL THESE OTHER THINGS.

01:49:09.342 --> 01:49:09.809
THAT ARE TAKING IN

01:49:09.876 --> 01:49:11.645
CONSIDERATION YET. US SOMETIMES

01:49:11.711 --> 01:49:13.113
FOR ECONOMIC REASONS WE HAVE TO

01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:16.549
DO THAT. SO I YOU KNOW I SEWER

01:49:16.616 --> 01:49:17.784
COMMITTEE WILL WILL HAVE. A

01:49:17.851 --> 01:49:19.386
MORE IN DEPTH DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:20.754
WHAT WE PLAN TO DO IN TERMS OF

01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:22.956
MOVING FORWARD. BECAUSE WE

01:49:23.023 --> 01:49:24.157
CAN'T KEEP ASKING THE SAME

01:49:24.224 --> 01:49:26.026
QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER- WE'RE

01:49:26.092 --> 01:49:26.660
GONNA LOOK AT THE

01:49:26.726 --> 01:49:28.361
REHABILITATION ISSUE THATWAS

01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:31.131
ONE FROM LAST YEAR- ENDS AND WE

01:49:31.197 --> 01:49:32.799
MAY ASK FOR. A MORE IN DEPTH

01:49:32.866 --> 01:49:34.668
REPORT ON THAT I WAS TALKING TO

01:49:34.734 --> 01:49:37.304
STAFF ABOUT THAT BECAUSE- OF

01:49:37.370 --> 01:49:38.838
ONCE AGAIN THAT WAS ONE OF THE

01:49:38.905 --> 01:49:39.406
MAJOR ISSUES THAT. WE WERE

01:49:39.472 --> 01:49:40.640
PUTTING PEOPLE IN CLASS WE HAVE

01:49:40.707 --> 01:49:42.509
THE NUMBERS THE DATA. BUT THEY

01:49:42.575 --> 01:49:45.345
WANT IN THIS ONCE THEY NEEDED.

01:49:45.412 --> 01:49:46.413
I AM SO YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKING

01:49:46.479 --> 01:49:47.981
THE FOURTH. SOMETHING AND YOU

01:49:48.048 --> 01:49:48.548
DON'T KNOW THE FIRST LEVEL.

01:49:48.615 --> 01:49:49.749
IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT FOR YOU

01:49:49.816 --> 01:49:51.484
TO APPRECIATE THE FOURTH LEVEL-

01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:53.954
AND SO THAT SEEMS TO BE A- ONE

01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:55.055
OF THE THINGS IS THERE AND HOW

01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:56.790
WOULD HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT-

01:49:56.856 --> 01:49:57.958
MAYBE EVERY PRISON DOESN'T

01:49:58.024 --> 01:49:59.926
OFFER ALL OF THE SAME. KIND OF

01:49:59.993 --> 01:50:02.429
SERVICES OR EITHER YOU LOOK YOU

01:50:02.495 --> 01:50:03.330
YOU LOOK AT THAT. THERE'S A LOT

01:50:03.396 --> 01:50:05.231
OF TIMES WE MOVED FROM. LEVEL

01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:07.100
FOR THIS SECURITY TO THREE TO

01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:07.801
TWO TO ONE SO MAYBE THERE'S

01:50:07.867 --> 01:50:09.035
SOME. SOME STRATEGY THAT NEEDS

01:50:09.102 --> 01:50:11.171
TO BE UTILIZED- IN TERMS OF

01:50:11.237 --> 01:50:12.739
INTRODUCING MATERIAL AT ONE

01:50:12.806 --> 01:50:15.408
LEVEL. AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO-

01:50:15.475 --> 01:50:16.943
FOR THEM TO BE. MOVED AS THEY

01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:18.411
PROGRESS IN AT DIFFERENT LEVELS

01:50:18.478 --> 01:50:22.015
OF THEIR- INCARCERATION. BUT

01:50:22.082 --> 01:50:23.683
CLEARLY THIS IS A QUESTION THAT

01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:26.286
WE KEEP ASKING. OVER AND OVER.

01:50:26.353 --> 01:50:28.588
A WHERE THE PLAN WAS A PLAN WAS

01:50:28.655 --> 01:50:30.357
A PLAN. I DON'T THINK WE WANT

01:50:30.423 --> 01:50:32.692
TO STRIDE PLAN. OF MOST OF US

01:50:32.759 --> 01:50:34.160
CARE. BUT I DON'T THINK YOU

01:50:34.227 --> 01:50:35.628
WANT ME TO BECAUSE I DON'T

01:50:35.695 --> 01:50:36.830
UNDERSTAND ALL THE SYMBOLS BUT

01:50:36.896 --> 01:50:40.133
ACT MAKE UP- SO. I DON'T THINK

01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:41.334
YOU WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. ALL

01:50:41.401 --> 01:50:43.003
WELL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I.

01:50:43.069 --> 01:50:44.104
THINK IT A MUCH MORE JUST A

01:50:44.170 --> 01:50:46.206
MEDIC WAY. KNOWING THAT EIGHTY

01:50:46.272 --> 01:50:47.173
PLAN WE PUT TOGETHER MAY HAVE

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.275
TO BE A- CHANGED. IT OFFICE

01:50:49.342 --> 01:50:50.710
SOME UPTAKE OR THERE'S SOME

01:50:50.777 --> 01:50:52.879
GREAT DECLINE SOMEWHERE. WE

01:50:52.946 --> 01:50:53.680
HAVE TO MAKE THAT ADJUSTMENT

01:50:53.747 --> 01:50:54.948
WITH TO MAKE THAT CHANGE- BUT

01:50:55.015 --> 01:50:57.817
IT BUT TO CONTINUE TO. EXIST

01:50:57.884 --> 01:50:59.819
WITHOUT A CLEAR. ALL MAKES IT

01:50:59.886 --> 01:51:01.154
VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO FUND

01:51:01.221 --> 01:51:03.156
THINGS AND TO. JUSTIFY WHAT

01:51:03.223 --> 01:51:05.125
WE'RE DOING. AND MEET THE NEEDS

01:51:05.191 --> 01:51:06.493

01:51:29.182 --> 01:51:31.284
SINCE SOME THE DEPARTMENT HAS

01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:33.353
BEEN VENTURING AND WE ARE IN

IF THEY DO COME BACK AND THERE

01:54:39.739 --> 01:54:42.508

01:55:48.041 --> 01:55:50.176
REQUESTED AN ASSET THAT THIS

01:55:50.243 --> 01:55:52.045
NEW POLICY AND REGULATION TAKE

01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:53.012
ON MORE THAN IT WAS ORIGINALLY

INTENDED. TO INCLUDE USES OF

THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS A WRITTEN

01:56:08.294 --> 01:56:09.462
THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT WAS

01:56:09.529 --> 01:56:10.630

OTHER DIRECTION I HAVE NEVER

HEARD ACCUSATIONS LIKE THIS IN

02:03:20.025 --> 02:03:21.927
ALL MY YEARS I WOULD STRONGLY

02:03:21.994 --> 02:03:23.529
SUGGEST PLACING A STRIKE TEAM

ON THIS YARD IMMEDIATELY. MANY

02:03:25.598 --> 02:03:26.699
OF THE INMATES HAVE EXPRESSED

02:03:26.766 --> 02:03:28.434
FEAR WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM

02:03:28.501 --> 02:03:29.535

02:03:31.670 --> 02:03:33.072

ATTENTION IF THERE IS ANY MEANS

02:03:35.341 --> 02:03:36.509
OF INSTALLING CAMERAS

02:03:36.575 --> 02:03:37.710
IMMEDIATELY I WAS STRONGLY

02:03:37.777 --> 02:03:40.012
SUGGESTED AT LEAST IN THE BLIND

02:03:40.079 --> 02:03:40.679
SPOTS IN THE BACK DOOR OF THE

02:03:40.746 --> 02:03:43.149

AND STAFF COMPLAINTS OR FAT

02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:48.888
YARD ALSO NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE

02:03:48.954 --> 02:03:50.689
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THAT'S

02:03:50.756 --> 02:03:52.691
THAT'S NOT US THAT'S THE

02:03:52.758 --> 02:03:56.128
OMBUDSMAN. LATER OF THE CHIEF

02:03:56.195 --> 02:03:57.797
FONG BIRDS AND WROTE THERE HAS

02:03:57.863 --> 02:03:59.165
BEEN LITTLE TO NO PROGRESS IN

02:03:59.231 --> 02:04:01.066
SEPTEMBER I AM NOT TYPICALLY AN

02:04:01.133 --> 02:04:02.568
ALARMIST BUT AGAIN I HAVE NEVER

02:04:02.635 --> 02:04:03.669
HEARD SUCH DISREPAIR

02:04:03.736 --> 02:04:05.037
HOPELESSNESS AND FEAR FROM

02:04:05.104 --> 02:04:06.806
INMATES. AND I HAVE BEEN ON

02:04:06.872 --> 02:04:08.040
QUITE A FEW OF THESE TEAMS TO

02:04:08.107 --> 02:04:09.742
REVIEW AN INTERVIEW INMATES THE

02:04:09.809 --> 02:04:12.344
CI W. TOUR RESULTS DON'T COME

02:04:12.411 --> 02:04:14.713
CLOSE TO THIS AND SEE AYE W.

02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:18.017
WAS VERY BAD. SO IN ADDITION TO

02:04:18.083 --> 02:04:20.886
THAT- WE HAVE THE SITUATION AT

02:04:20.953 --> 02:04:23.722
THE- SACRAMENTO COUNTY

02:04:23.789 --> 02:04:26.225
SACRAMENTO STATE PRISON- AT

02:04:26.292 --> 02:04:28.494
FOLSOM. WHERE THEY WERE NINE

02:04:28.561 --> 02:04:30.729
SUICIDES IN TWO THOUSAND

02:04:30.796 --> 02:04:31.797
NINETEEN THAT'S AN ASTRONOMICAL

02:04:31.864 --> 02:04:33.499
RATE OF SUICIDES OFPER

02:04:33.566 --> 02:04:36.001
POPULATION. THERE WERE THREE

02:04:36.068 --> 02:04:38.938
HOMICIDES- AND WE'VE JUST

02:04:39.004 --> 02:04:41.006
LEARNED. FROM A TOUR LAST WEEK

02:04:41.073 --> 02:04:43.542
THAT. NOT ONLY INMATES ARE

02:04:43.609 --> 02:04:45.511
FEARFUL OF GET OF RECALL OF

02:04:45.578 --> 02:04:47.213
LEAVING THEIR CELLS TO GET

02:04:47.279 --> 02:04:49.615
HEALTH CARE BUT THE DOCTORS

02:04:49.682 --> 02:04:51.217
NURSES AND OTHER CLINICIANS ARE

02:04:51.283 --> 02:04:53.819
SCARED TO PROVIDE THE CARE-

02:04:53.886 --> 02:04:55.454
BECAUSE OF THEIR FEAR OF

02:04:55.521 --> 02:05:02.027
VIOLENCE. SO WHAT YOU HAVE

02:05:02.094 --> 02:05:04.496
RIGHT NOW IS THAT CDC ARE

02:05:04.563 --> 02:05:06.498
REALLY HAS NO WORKING SYSTEM TO

02:05:06.565 --> 02:05:08.000
IDENTIFY THESE PROBLEMS THAT

02:05:08.067 --> 02:05:09.535
SYSTEM IS US THE PRISON LAW

02:05:09.602 --> 02:05:11.103
OFFICE MY COLLEAGUES AND ROADS

02:05:11.170 --> 02:05:13.372
IN BE GALVANIC GROUND FILLED IN

02:05:13.439 --> 02:05:14.673
AND THE INSPECTOR GENERAL TO

02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:16.642
SOME EXTENT IF I WERE TO

02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:18.644
CHARACTERIZE THE SITUATION IN

02:05:18.711 --> 02:05:20.846
THE MOST GLOBAL TERMS I WOULD

02:05:20.913 --> 02:05:26.919
pACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM- IS NOT

02:05:26.986 --> 02:05:29.822
INDEPENDENT. OF THE

02:05:29.889 --> 02:05:33.392
INSTITUTIONS AND- IT'S NOT

02:05:33.459 --> 02:05:34.827
COMPLETELY CENTRALIZED THAT

02:05:34.894 --> 02:05:36.762
STILL- WORKING AT THE

02:05:36.829 --> 02:05:41.901
INSTITUTIONS. SO LAST YEAR- YOU

02:05:41.967 --> 02:05:44.570
ALL AS THE LEGISLATURE- AND THE

02:05:44.637 --> 02:05:48.173
ADMINISTRATION- APPROPRIATED

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.276
TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO HIRE-

02:05:50.342 --> 02:05:51.777
SPECIALLY TRAINED INVESTIGATORS

02:05:51.844 --> 02:05:53.612
IN THOSE THE ONES THAT MISSED

02:05:53.679 --> 02:05:54.747
STE MISTER DE AS WAS REFERRING

02:05:54.813 --> 02:05:57.416
TO. AND WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY

02:05:57.483 --> 02:05:58.450
MUCH AND WE APPRECIATE THE FACT

02:05:58.517 --> 02:05:59.451
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

02:05:59.518 --> 02:06:01.053
INCLUDING MISTER DE AS

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:02.688
SUPPORTED THAT IN ORDER TO

02:06:02.755 --> 02:06:04.790
START TO AMELIORATE SOME OF

02:06:04.857 --> 02:06:08.527
THESE PROBLEMS- AND THOSE

02:06:08.594 --> 02:06:10.729
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE A STEP IN

02:06:10.796 --> 02:06:11.764
THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE

02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:14.433
THEY WILL LIKE MISTER DATA SAID

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:14.900
THERE WILL GET ENHANCE

02:06:14.967 --> 02:06:16.602
TRAINING- AND THEY WORK FOR THE

02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:18.704
OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS

02:06:18.771 --> 02:06:21.540
WHICH YOU KNOW HAS BEEN. IT'S

02:06:21.607 --> 02:06:23.909
THAT HAVE THEIR THEIR ABILITY

02:06:23.976 --> 02:06:26.111
TO PROPERLY INVESTIGATE CASES

02:06:26.178 --> 02:06:27.012
IN THE PRISONS HASN'T BEEN

02:06:27.079 --> 02:06:30.182
QUESTION. SOME MIGHT THE PLACE

02:06:30.249 --> 02:06:31.817
I START FROM IS YOU HAVE A

02:06:31.884 --> 02:06:32.952
WORKING PART OF THE DEPARTMENT

02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:34.920
OF CORRECTIONS. WHAT YOU NEED

02:06:34.987 --> 02:06:37.356
TO DO IS PUT MORE OF THE CASES

02:06:37.423 --> 02:06:39.258
INTO THAT DEPARTMENT FOR THEM

02:06:39.325 --> 02:06:40.326
TO INVESTIGATE BECAUSE THEY'VE

02:06:40.392 --> 02:06:41.627
BEEN TRAINED AS INVESTIGATORS

02:06:41.694 --> 02:06:43.729
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

02:06:43.796 --> 02:06:47.132
AND THEY CAN THANK YOU YOU CAN

02:06:47.199 --> 02:06:48.968
HAVE THE RIGHT. MORE ACCURATE

02:06:49.034 --> 02:06:54.773
AND RELIABLE RESULTS. SO BUT IN

02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:56.976
THE NEW REGULATIONS DRAFT

02:06:57.042 --> 02:06:59.011
REGULATIONS THAT MISTER DE AS

02:06:59.078 --> 02:07:01.280
REFERRED TO- SOME OF THEM ARE

02:07:01.347 --> 02:07:03.148
POSITIVE CHANGES THAT- HE

02:07:03.215 --> 02:07:04.483
MENTIONED A NUMBER OF THEM AND

02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:06.185
I FULLY SUPPORT THEM BUT SOME

02:07:06.251 --> 02:07:07.686
OF THEM HAVE FATAL FLAWS BUT

02:07:07.753 --> 02:07:09.421
THERE FATAL FLAWS BECAUSE IN MY

02:07:09.488 --> 02:07:11.890
OPINION. THEY REDUCE THE

02:07:11.957 --> 02:07:12.324
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

02:07:12.391 --> 02:07:15.995
INVESTIGATORS. OF BY REDUCING

02:07:16.061 --> 02:07:17.930
THEIR INDEPENDENCE ESSENTIALLY-

02:07:17.997 --> 02:07:19.765
THERE ARE TWO- THERE ARE THREE

02:07:19.832 --> 02:07:22.935
WAYS I THINK THAT THEY DO THIS

02:07:23.002 --> 02:07:27.306
ONE IS THAT. ONLY CASES IN

02:07:27.373 --> 02:07:29.641
WHICH THERE IS NO REPORT OF A

02:07:29.708 --> 02:07:33.312
USE OF FORCE WHICH- HAPPENS BUT

02:07:33.379 --> 02:07:35.547
IS VERY IT'S VERY RARE THAT YOU

02:07:35.614 --> 02:07:37.716
ACTUALLY FIND OUT ABOUT IT. OR

02:07:37.783 --> 02:07:41.086
CASES IN WHICH- SOMEBODY

02:07:41.153 --> 02:07:43.322
SUFFERS SERIOUS BODILY HARM OR

02:07:43.389 --> 02:07:44.990
INJURY AS DEFINED BY THE PENAL

02:07:45.057 --> 02:07:47.760
CODE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE

02:07:47.826 --> 02:07:50.529
AN OFFICER WHO THROUGH IT A

02:07:50.596 --> 02:07:51.163
PERSON WHO COULDN'T WALK OUT OF

02:07:51.230 --> 02:07:53.966
A WHEELCHAIR- AND KICK THEM BUT

02:07:54.033 --> 02:07:56.402
DIDN'T. AND WROTE A REPORT

02:07:56.468 --> 02:07:57.736
ABOUT IT BUT THERE WAS NO

02:07:57.803 --> 02:07:59.605
SERIOUS BODILY INJURY THEN THE

02:07:59.671 --> 02:08:00.906
OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS

02:08:00.973 --> 02:08:03.108
INVESTIGATORS ARE NOT GOING TO

02:08:03.175 --> 02:08:05.844
DO THAT INVESTIGATION. AT OR IF

02:08:05.911 --> 02:08:07.379
I PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE AND I'M

02:08:07.446 --> 02:08:09.148
AN OFFICER AND YOU'RE A PERSON

02:08:09.214 --> 02:08:11.350
WHO IS INCARCERATED AND I'D I

02:08:11.417 --> 02:08:14.153
JUST GIVE YOU A BLOODY NOSE OR

02:08:14.219 --> 02:08:16.522
I GIVE YOU A BLACK GUY- THERE'S

02:08:16.588 --> 02:08:17.723
NO SERIOUS BODILY INJURY SO

02:08:17.790 --> 02:08:19.591
THAT ALSO WOULDN'T BE

02:08:19.658 --> 02:08:24.563
INVESTIGATED BY THE- THE OFFICE

02:08:24.630 --> 02:08:25.697
OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS

02:08:25.764 --> 02:08:27.866
INVESTIGATORS CALLED THEY'RE

02:08:27.933 --> 02:08:30.469
CALLED THE AIMS INVESTIGATORS.

02:08:30.536 --> 02:08:32.304
AND THE SECOND MAJOR PROBLEM IS

02:08:32.371 --> 02:08:36.108
THAT THE WARDEN STILL DECIDES

02:08:36.175 --> 02:08:37.843
WHETHER WHICH OF THE TWO

02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:39.578
INVESTIGATIVE SYSTEMS THE CASE

02:08:39.645 --> 02:08:42.481
GOES TO. THE WARDEN DECIDES

02:08:42.548 --> 02:08:44.483
WHETHER HIS STAFFER GONNA

02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:46.218
INVESTIGATED OR THE OFFICE OF

02:08:46.285 --> 02:08:48.020
INSPECTOR. OFFICE OF INTERNAL

02:08:48.087 --> 02:08:53.292
AFFAIRS INVESTIGATES IT AND-

02:08:53.358 --> 02:08:54.626
THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAJOR

02:08:54.693 --> 02:08:56.595
PROBLEMS IS THAT THE WARDENS

02:08:56.662 --> 02:08:59.598
HAVE HAD THESE. SITUATIONS

02:08:59.665 --> 02:09:01.233
UNDER THEIR DIRECTION AND SUPER

02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:02.935
MEDIA SUPERVISION AND YET THEY

02:09:03.001 --> 02:09:05.938
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ELEVATE

02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:08.207
THESE. ISSUES TO THE OFFICE OF

02:09:08.273 --> 02:09:09.274
INTERNAL AFFAIRS IN THE

02:09:09.341 --> 02:09:10.943
SUFFICIENT WIFE SO THAT MISTER

02:09:11.009 --> 02:09:13.011
DE AS AND HIS SUBORDINATES

02:09:13.078 --> 02:09:13.545
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A

02:09:13.612 --> 02:09:18.183
CRISIS. SO WHAT WHAT. WE'VE

02:09:18.250 --> 02:09:20.586
BEEN ADVOCATING FOR AND SO FAR

02:09:20.652 --> 02:09:21.620
WE HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN

02:09:21.687 --> 02:09:23.655
SUCCESSFUL IN CONVINCING OF THE

02:09:23.722 --> 02:09:25.657
SECRETARY OR THE ADMINISTRATION

02:09:25.724 --> 02:09:28.494
THAT IT'S CRUCIAL. IS THAT THE-

02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:30.295
ALL OF THESE USE OF FORCE CASES

02:09:30.362 --> 02:09:32.831
SHOULD BE. TURNED OVER TO THE

02:09:32.898 --> 02:09:35.801
OFFICE. OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS IN

02:09:35.868 --> 02:09:37.903
ORDER. FOR THEM TO MAKE A

02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:40.205
DETERMINATION HOW FOR HOW THEY

02:09:40.272 --> 02:09:41.240
SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED NOT THE

02:09:41.306 --> 02:09:43.342
WARDEN. AND I CAN GIVE YOU AN

02:09:43.408 --> 02:09:45.577
EXAMPLE OF THE FACT THAT- I'VE

02:09:45.644 --> 02:09:46.979
SAT IN ON SOME OF THESE

02:09:47.045 --> 02:09:48.213
COMMITTEES WERE THE WARDEN

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:51.283
REVIEWS THESE IN INSTANCES AND-

02:09:51.350 --> 02:09:53.318
THE SITUATION AS THE WARDEN IS

02:09:53.385 --> 02:09:55.287
SITTING THERE AND SO ARE ALL

02:09:55.354 --> 02:09:56.922
THE CAPTAINS AND ASSOCIATE

02:09:56.989 --> 02:09:59.091
WARDEN SO IT'S BASICALLY A SEA

02:09:59.158 --> 02:10:02.995
OF GREEN- UNIFORMS- AND HE HAS

02:10:03.061 --> 02:10:05.264
TO DECIDE WHETHER ALL OF THE

02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:09.868
PEOPLE THAT THEY KNOW- THEIR

02:10:09.935 --> 02:10:12.538
FRIENDS ARE GOING TO BE-INVESTIGATED BY THE OFFICE OF

02:10:12.604 --> 02:10:15.440
INTERNAL AFFAIRS RATHER THAN BY

02:10:15.507 --> 02:10:16.074
HIM. AND IT'S A OR HER AND IT'S

02:10:16.141 --> 02:10:17.342
A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION TO

02:10:17.409 --> 02:10:19.711
MAKE AND I THINK IT- THE WAY

02:10:19.778 --> 02:10:21.013
THE REGULATIONS A DRAFT OF THE

02:10:21.079 --> 02:10:23.081
MOMENT. REALLY REDUCES THE

02:10:23.148 --> 02:10:24.116
INDEPENDENCE OF THE

02:10:24.183 --> 02:10:26.752
INVESTIGATION AND PLAYS INTO

02:10:26.818 --> 02:10:28.754
THE FACT THAT. WE'RE GOING TO

02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:32.424
HAVE THESE. INSTANCES OF

02:10:32.491 --> 02:10:34.193
CONTINUE STAFF MISCONDUCT WHICH

02:10:34.259 --> 02:10:35.627
ARE NOT GOING TO BE PROPERLY

02:10:35.694 --> 02:10:39.164
INVESTIGATED. THERE ARE ALSO

02:10:39.231 --> 02:10:40.332
SOME OTHER TECHNICAL PROBLEMS

02:10:40.399 --> 02:10:43.569
BUT SO- WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

02:10:43.635 --> 02:10:45.337
DO MISTER DE AS IS CORRECT THAT

02:10:45.404 --> 02:10:47.439
WE HAVE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS-

02:10:47.506 --> 02:10:50.742
I'VE HAD WITH HIM I'VE HAD WITH

02:10:50.809 --> 02:10:51.743
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND WE

02:10:51.810 --> 02:10:54.213
REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN. COME TO AN

02:10:54.279 --> 02:10:57.783
AGREEMENT- AND I THINK IT WILL

02:10:57.849 --> 02:11:00.886
REALLY REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS

02:11:00.953 --> 02:11:02.487
OF THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS YOU

02:11:02.554 --> 02:11:05.691
SPENT IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS-

02:11:05.757 --> 02:11:07.793
STRAND A SOLVE SOME OF THESE

02:11:07.859 --> 02:11:13.332
PROBLEMS. OKAY I DON'T KNOW IF

02:11:13.398 --> 02:11:17.703
YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS YEAH IBM.

02:11:17.769 --> 02:11:18.904
WELL I THINK WE WERE RELATIVELY

02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:21.240
CLEAR LAST TIME WHEN WE TALKED

02:11:21.306 --> 02:11:24.676
ABOUT THIS AND I FIND IT VERY

02:11:24.743 --> 02:11:26.044
ALARMING THAT THESE THINGS ARE

02:11:26.111 --> 02:11:29.147
STILL TAKING PLACE- IN OUR

02:11:29.214 --> 02:11:32.217
PRISONS. AND I READ A LOT OF

02:11:32.284 --> 02:11:33.252
THE STORIES AND THEY'RE

02:11:33.318 --> 02:11:34.620
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE ABSOLUTELY

02:11:34.686 --> 02:11:36.088
HORRIBLE THAT THEY'RE COMMITTED

02:11:36.154 --> 02:11:39.458
BAR STAFF. YOU KNOW WE TRY TO

02:11:39.524 --> 02:11:42.394
OF HOPEFULLY. KEEP THE VIOLENCE

02:11:42.461 --> 02:11:45.530
DOWN AMONG. THE INMATES BUT IT

02:11:45.597 --> 02:11:47.232
SEEMS THAT A LOT OF THE STUFF

02:11:47.299 --> 02:11:48.700
IS INSTIGATED BY PEOPLE WHO

02:11:48.767 --> 02:11:51.370
WORK FOR US. AND OUR AND WE

02:11:51.436 --> 02:11:53.138
SHOULD NOT BE DOING THIS I

02:11:53.205 --> 02:11:54.373
DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE HAVE.

02:11:54.439 --> 02:11:56.608
DIFFICULTY FINDING PEOPLE TO

02:11:56.675 --> 02:11:58.143
WORK OR OR OR WHAT BUT THIS

02:11:58.210 --> 02:12:01.213
DEFICIT. IT'S ABSOLUTELY

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:03.081
HORRIBLE AND I GUESS SO OFTEN I

02:12:03.148 --> 02:12:04.349
HEAR ABOUT FOLKS WHO ARE

02:12:04.416 --> 02:12:05.651
INCARCERATED WHO COME OUT AND

02:12:05.717 --> 02:12:07.686
TELL ME SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

02:12:07.753 --> 02:12:08.754
ARE JUST ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE

02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:10.289
THAT HAPPENED TO THEM WHAT WAS

02:12:10.355 --> 02:12:12.658
SEXUAL ASSAULT. ALL AND THOSE

02:12:12.724 --> 02:12:14.393
KINDS OF THINGS AND IT'S JUST-

02:12:14.459 --> 02:12:15.627
IT'S HORRIBLE THAT WE WOULD

02:12:15.694 --> 02:12:17.162
HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WE WOULD

02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:20.065
PROTECT IN SOME WAY. THE KIND

02:12:20.132 --> 02:12:22.100
OF THINGS THAT OCCUR. YEAH I

02:12:22.167 --> 02:12:23.769
FIND IT. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE

02:12:23.835 --> 02:12:25.637
AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN GOING ON

02:12:25.704 --> 02:12:27.306
FOR EVER AND IT AND IT BOTHERS

02:12:27.372 --> 02:12:28.807
ME THAT BECOMES THAT. THE

02:12:28.874 --> 02:12:30.042
CULTURE OF INCARCERATION IN

02:12:30.108 --> 02:12:31.643
THIS NATION YOU KNOW THAT. A

02:12:31.710 --> 02:12:33.612
PERSON. GETS INCARCERATED THE

02:12:33.679 --> 02:12:34.846
FIRST THING SOMEONE SAYS TO

02:12:34.913 --> 02:12:36.682
THEM ARE YOU GOING TO BECOME

02:12:36.748 --> 02:12:38.350
JONES GIRLFRIEND. I MEAN THAT

02:12:38.417 --> 02:12:40.319
SAYS WE INCOME DON'T THIS LEVEL

02:12:40.385 --> 02:12:42.421
OF BEHAVIOR. YOU KNOW WHETHER

02:12:42.487 --> 02:12:43.155
IT'S STATE ABOUT THE POLICE

02:12:43.221 --> 02:12:45.123
OFFICER OR WHOEVER IT IS. IS

02:12:45.190 --> 02:12:48.026
LIKE WE EXPECT ABUSE TO OCCUR

02:12:48.093 --> 02:12:50.562
IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM. WHICH IS

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:54.199
TO ME TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. AND

02:12:54.266 --> 02:12:57.035
YOU KNOW OF. GOING TO PRISON IS

02:12:57.102 --> 02:12:58.070
FRIGHTENING ENOUGH BUT KNOWING

02:12:58.136 --> 02:12:59.871
THAT THERE WILL BE YOU KNOW ALL

02:12:59.938 --> 02:13:02.207
KINDS OF VIOLENCE ON FOLKS WHEN

02:13:02.274 --> 02:13:04.443
THEY BEAR. WITH NOBLE. EFFORT

02:13:04.509 --> 02:13:06.078
TO SEEM TO STOP IT IT SOME

02:13:06.144 --> 02:13:08.213
POINT WELL YOU HAVE NO MEANS OF

02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:11.917
TRYING TO- CORRECT IT UP OR OR

02:13:11.983 --> 02:13:13.618
YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS TO SAY WHAT

02:13:13.685 --> 02:13:14.986
TOOK PLACE BECAUSE IN THE BE

02:13:15.053 --> 02:13:16.888
RETALIATION TO YOU. EITHER BY

02:13:16.955 --> 02:13:20.392
OTHER INMATES OR BY THE FOLKS

02:13:20.459 --> 02:13:22.160
WHO RUN THE PRISONS THAT I MEAN

02:13:22.227 --> 02:13:23.528
THAT IS. THAT IS THAT TO ME IS

02:13:23.595 --> 02:13:24.463
VERY FRIGHTENING AND

02:13:24.529 --> 02:13:26.465
UNACCEPTABLE AND I CAN'T FIGURE

02:13:26.531 --> 02:13:28.433
OUT HOW WE COULD EVER EXPECT.

02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:29.568
TO RUN A SYSTEM OF

02:13:29.634 --> 02:13:33.271
INCARCERATION. AND EXPECT

02:13:33.338 --> 02:13:35.107
PEOPLE TO COME OUT BETTER. IF

02:13:35.173 --> 02:13:35.607
THEY'RE IN THAT KIND OF

02:13:35.674 --> 02:13:39.578
ENVIRONMENT. IT IT'S YOU KNOW

02:13:39.644 --> 02:13:40.712
IT'S WORSE IN THE VIOLENCE THEY

02:13:40.779 --> 02:13:42.314
THEY FACE ON THE STREET SO I'M

02:13:42.381 --> 02:13:43.982
JUST YEAH I'M VERY CONCERNED

02:13:44.049 --> 02:13:45.250
AND I AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:13:45.317 --> 02:13:47.419
LOOK AT THE REGULATIONS I HOPE-

02:13:47.486 --> 02:13:48.687
AND- BECAUSE WE'RE SPENDING

02:13:48.754 --> 02:13:50.789
MONEY ON THIS BUT ASKING FOLKS

02:13:50.856 --> 02:13:54.493
WHO WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY. DONE

02:13:54.559 --> 02:13:56.261
VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHERS TO ONCE

02:13:56.328 --> 02:13:57.396
AGAIN HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

02:13:57.462 --> 02:13:58.930
DETERMINE WHO DOES THE

02:13:58.997 --> 02:14:01.066
INVESTIGATION AND THOSE KINDS

02:14:01.133 --> 02:14:04.236
OF THINGS IS JUST DUMB IT I CAN

02:14:04.302 --> 02:14:06.071
X. SEE HOW WE CAN EXPECT

02:14:06.138 --> 02:14:08.006
ANYTHING DIFFERENT. AND MAYBE

02:14:08.073 --> 02:14:09.574
YOU CAN BUT I CAN'T SEE HOW

02:14:09.641 --> 02:14:10.776
WE'D EXPECT ANY DIFFERENT

02:14:10.842 --> 02:14:12.978
RESULTS IF THE IF I DON'T

02:14:13.044 --> 02:14:15.747

02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:42.441
INSTITUTION THAT DON SPEAKS

02:14:42.507 --> 02:14:45.510
ABOUT RJD WE HAVE TERMINATED

02:14:45.577 --> 02:14:46.745
FOURTEEN INDIVIDUALS AT THAT

02:14:46.812 --> 02:14:49.681

MODELS. WHAT I THINK WHAT WAS

02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:14.539
SPOKE ABOUT BY MISTER SPECTER.

02:15:14.606 --> 02:15:16.608
I THINK PART OF IT IS IT IS IN

02:15:16.675 --> 02:15:18.310
A SIMPLIFICATION OF VARIOUS

02:15:18.376 --> 02:15:20.545
PROCESSES THAT OCCUR. LIKE I

02:15:20.612 --> 02:15:22.581
USED TO FORCE PROCESS. EVERY

02:15:22.647 --> 02:15:24.349
REPORTER EVERY USE OF FORCE

02:15:24.416 --> 02:15:27.018
THAT IT IS- THAT IS DONE IN OUR

02:15:27.085 --> 02:15:28.353
INSTITUTIONS FROM THE LOWEST

02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:29.754
LEVEL TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL

02:15:29.821 --> 02:15:31.223
THERE'S A REVIEW PROCESS THAT

02:15:31.289 --> 02:15:32.424
OCCURS AND I KNOW MISTER

02:15:32.491 --> 02:15:34.626
SPECTER DID SPEAK OF A ROOM

02:15:34.693 --> 02:15:36.361
FULL OF A SOCIAL WARDENS AND

02:15:36.428 --> 02:15:39.698

LISTENING TO THE REVIEW PROCESS

02:15:46.905 --> 02:15:48.340
FROM THE BEGINNING FROM THE

02:15:48.406 --> 02:15:49.040
TIME THE OFFICER WROTE THE

02:15:54.246 --> 02:15:55.046
WAY THAT THEY'RE THERE ARE

02:15:55.113 --> 02:15:57.482
REFERRALS THAT DO OCCUR FOR

02:15:57.549 --> 02:15:59.584
INAPPROPRIATE USES OF FORCE OR

02:15:59.651 --> 02:16:01.920
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE IN THAT

02:16:01.987 --> 02:16:03.655
PROCESS AND IT'S WELL

02:16:03.722 --> 02:16:05.257

WHAT I'M EXPLAINING TODAY IS

02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:43.895
THAT THIS NEW REGULATION WILL

ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS

02:16:45.597 --> 02:16:47.666
DON AND I DO DISAGREE. ON ONE

02:16:47.732 --> 02:16:49.734
PARTICULAR AREA FOR THAT WERE

02:16:49.801 --> 02:16:50.635
THERE'S A FORK IN THE ROAD

02:16:50.702 --> 02:16:52.804
AFTER THE- INVESTIGATION IS

02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:54.306
DONE OF IN KOREA IS DONE BY THE

02:16:54.372 --> 02:16:57.208
NEW UNIT. THAT WHO DETERMINES

02:16:57.275 --> 02:16:58.343
WHETHER SHE GOT OFFICE INTERNAL

AIMS UNIT. WHICH IS A CAPTAIN

02:17:02.414 --> 02:17:03.615
OR A LIEUTENANT BECAUSE THE WAY

02:17:03.682 --> 02:17:05.383
THAT THIS IS DESIGNED AS CAN BE

02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:07.085
BROKEN UP INTO THREE REGIONS.

02:17:07.152 --> 02:17:08.920
NORTHERN CENTRAL SOUTHERN. THE

LIEUTENANTS THAT WORK AND DO

02:17:13.124 --> 02:17:14.593
THESE ENQUIRIES. SO THE THOUGHT

02:17:14.659 --> 02:17:16.461
IS ONCE A COMPLAINT IS REFERRED

02:17:16.528 --> 02:17:18.463

LIEUTENANT'S GO AND THEY DO AN

02:17:19.664 --> 02:17:20.865
INQUIRY THEY REVIEW THE

DOCUMENTS TO INTERVIEW INMATES

02:17:22.901 --> 02:17:24.369

02:17:26.705 --> 02:17:27.205
HUNDRED THIRTY THEN THEY CAN

02:17:27.272 --> 02:17:29.140
MAKE THAT DECISION IS IT GONNA

02:17:29.207 --> 02:17:30.075
GO TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL

02:17:30.141 --> 02:17:31.610

02:17:31.676 --> 02:17:34.245
MORE LOCALIZED TRAINING OR OR

OTHER MATTERS. BUT THERE'S ALSO

02:17:36.247 --> 02:17:37.349
ANOTHER STEP THAT I SPOKE OF

02:17:37.415 --> 02:17:39.284

TO. ARTICULATE IN THIS POLICY

02:17:47.459 --> 02:17:49.494
WHY THEY CHOSE NOT TO REFER.

02:17:49.561 --> 02:17:51.663

02:18:55.293 --> 02:18:56.695
TERRIBLE ABUSES THAT HAVE

02:18:56.761 --> 02:18:58.730
HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS I JUST

02:18:58.797 --> 02:19:02.667
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. I KNOW IF

02:19:02.734 --> 02:19:03.668
THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL

02:19:03.735 --> 02:19:06.271
DISAGREEMENT AND I UNDERSTAND

02:19:06.337 --> 02:19:09.607
MISTER DE AS A- HE ANSWERS TO A

02:19:09.674 --> 02:19:11.276
LOT MORE CONSTITUENTS THAN I

02:19:11.342 --> 02:19:15.346
DO- BUT GIVEN THE SITUATION- I

02:19:15.413 --> 02:19:17.015
JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE-

02:19:17.082 --> 02:19:18.416
THE STATE'S STATE AS A WHOLE

02:19:18.483 --> 02:19:24.389
ISN'T. GOING FOR THE MOST

02:19:24.456 --> 02:19:27.659
INDEPENDENT SITUATION THAT THEY

02:19:27.726 --> 02:19:30.228
CAN HAVE AND THE MOST VIGOROUS

02:19:30.295 --> 02:19:31.362
INVESTIGATIONS THAT THEY CAN

02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:33.064
HAVE BOTH OF THE THINGS I'M

02:19:33.131 --> 02:19:34.632
SUGGESTING ARE AIMED IN THAT

02:19:34.699 --> 02:19:36.434
DIRECTION AND GIVEN THE

02:19:36.501 --> 02:19:37.802
SITUATIONS THAT WE JUST

02:19:37.869 --> 02:19:39.571
DISCOVERED AT RJ DE I JUST.

02:19:39.637 --> 02:19:42.140
WHICH IS. I'D IN ORDER BEEN

02:19:42.207 --> 02:19:44.375
HISTORY THESE KINDS OF CASES I

02:19:44.442 --> 02:19:45.510
THINK THAT'S WHAT'S NEEDED WHEN

02:19:45.577 --> 02:19:50.815
I. I HAVE A FRIEND WHO'S A THE

02:19:50.882 --> 02:19:51.382
DIRECTOR OF THE PENNSYLVANIA

02:19:51.449 --> 02:19:51.916
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS

02:19:51.983 --> 02:19:54.352
CITIES THE SEC. OF THAT. AND I

02:19:54.419 --> 02:19:57.088
CALLED HIM UP WHEN THE SLINGS

02:19:57.155 --> 02:19:59.657
VALLEY CASE WAS GETTING GOING

02:19:59.724 --> 02:20:00.859
AND THE ORIGIN WAS DOING THE

02:20:00.925 --> 02:20:02.227
REPORT I SAID WHAT JOHN WHAT DO

02:20:02.293 --> 02:20:03.862
YOU DO AND HE SAID WHAT I DID

02:20:03.928 --> 02:20:07.332
WAS I. FOUND SOMEBODY A FORMER

02:20:07.398 --> 02:20:10.402
FBI AGENT. HI MADE HIM IN

02:20:10.468 --> 02:20:11.936
CHARGE OF THE OFFICE OF

02:20:12.003 --> 02:20:13.838
INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND I TOOK ALL

02:20:13.905 --> 02:20:16.074
OF THE- DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS

02:20:16.141 --> 02:20:17.909
AWAY FROM THE WARDENS AND

02:20:17.976 --> 02:20:19.711
LOCATED IN THE OFFICE OF AN

02:20:19.778 --> 02:20:22.413
INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND MICE THE

02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:24.616
SITUATION HAS SUBSTANTIALLY

02:20:24.682 --> 02:20:26.985
IMPROVED I CAN'T VERIFY THAT

02:20:27.051 --> 02:20:29.287
BUT THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. SO I

02:20:29.354 --> 02:20:30.955
THINK THAT'S THE DIRECTION THE

02:20:31.022 --> 02:20:31.956
DEPARTMENT HAS TO GO AND IF

02:20:32.023 --> 02:20:33.224
IT'S GOING TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF

02:20:33.291 --> 02:20:34.592
IDENTIFYING THESE PROBLEMS AND

02:20:34.659 --> 02:20:37.595
FIXING THEM. THANK YOU THANK

02:20:37.662 --> 02:20:39.197
YOU DID YOUR THING THEN. LIST

02:20:39.264 --> 02:20:44.035
OF. I DO I GUESS I'M- A LITTLE

02:20:44.102 --> 02:20:46.004
DISAPPOINTED IN HOW THIS IS

02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:47.806
ULTIMATELY ROLLING OUT. BECAUSE

02:20:47.872 --> 02:20:52.243
THE. WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL

02:20:52.310 --> 02:20:53.244
IN THE MESSAGE THAT WE'RE

02:20:53.311 --> 02:20:54.979
SENDING WITH THE REGULATIONS

02:20:55.046 --> 02:20:58.383
AND I APPRECIATE. YOUR THAT YOU

02:20:58.449 --> 02:21:00.518
ARE THE SECTOR ABSOLUTELY

02:21:00.585 --> 02:21:03.188
SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. BUT BECAUSE

02:21:03.254 --> 02:21:05.123
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO CHANGE

02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:06.891
ITS ESSENCE IS CULTURAL AND

02:21:06.958 --> 02:21:07.959
CULTURE THAT'S BEEN BUILT UP

02:21:08.026 --> 02:21:10.795
OVER DECADES TO DO THAT I THINK

02:21:10.862 --> 02:21:13.531
WE NEED TO TAKE. A BIT MORE

02:21:13.598 --> 02:21:16.067
DRAMATIC STEP THANOTHERWISE IN

02:21:16.134 --> 02:21:18.269
ANYTHING THAT. I THINK WITHOUT

02:21:18.336 --> 02:21:22.340
A DEFAULT MADAM CHAIR TO A VERY

02:21:22.407 --> 02:21:24.843
VERY CLEAR INDEPENDENCE. WE'RE

02:21:24.909 --> 02:21:26.845
NOT SENDING BACK RIGHT MESSAGE.

02:21:26.911 --> 02:21:29.113
AND WE OFTEN UP HERE TALK ABOUT

02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:30.548
THE PRISON SYSTEM IN GENERAL

02:21:30.615 --> 02:21:33.518
BUT IT CAN NOT ALWAYS THAN

02:21:33.585 --> 02:21:36.387
ABOUT SPECIFIC POPULATIONS BUT

02:21:36.454 --> 02:21:38.189
BY EXAMPLE AND SOME OF IT IS AN-

02:21:38.256 --> 02:21:40.124
THE STAFF REPORT. I THINK WOMEN

02:21:40.191 --> 02:21:42.560
WHO ARE CARS RATED FACE SOME

02:21:42.627 --> 02:21:44.562
VERY DRAMATIC CIRCUMSTANCES

02:21:44.629 --> 02:21:46.297
THAT ARE HARD TO GET OUT OF IT

02:21:46.364 --> 02:21:48.299
HARD TO CHANGE FACT HAVE BEEN

02:21:48.366 --> 02:21:50.401
RECENTLY TALKING JUST BEGINNING

02:21:50.468 --> 02:21:52.804
TO CUT HAVE CONVERSATIONS. SOME

02:21:52.871 --> 02:21:57.375
PEOPLE WHO HAVE. GONE INTO SOME

02:21:57.442 --> 02:21:57.909
OF THE WOMEN'S FACILITIES

02:21:57.976 --> 02:21:58.576
THERE. AT THE- SEE TO BE FAIRLY

02:21:58.643 --> 02:22:00.311
PERVASIVE HOW MUCH I THINK IT'S

02:22:00.378 --> 02:22:02.146
GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:22:02.213 --> 02:22:04.782
ASCERTAIN. BECAUSE IN A NUMBER

02:22:04.849 --> 02:22:06.184
OF THE WOMEN WHO EVEN WHEN THEY

02:22:06.251 --> 02:22:07.819
COME OUT OR SO TRAUMATIZED BY

02:22:07.886 --> 02:22:09.787
WHAT HAPPENED AND SO FEARFUL OF

02:22:09.854 --> 02:22:11.723
TALKING. WHAT I'VE ASKED IF

02:22:11.789 --> 02:22:13.391
THERE'S A WILLINGNESS COME TALK

02:22:13.458 --> 02:22:14.959
TO ME TO HELP EXPLAIN SO THAT

02:22:15.026 --> 02:22:15.860
THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:22:15.927 --> 02:22:17.495
HAPPENED INSIDE THERE'S A REAL

02:22:17.562 --> 02:22:19.097
UNWILLINGNESS FOR WOMEN WHO

02:22:19.163 --> 02:22:21.466
HAVE COME OUT. TO EVEN

02:22:21.532 --> 02:22:22.600
ARTICULATE WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE

02:22:22.667 --> 02:22:24.869
THERE SO AFRAID. OF

02:22:24.936 --> 02:22:27.872
CONSEQUENCES. THEY'RE OUTSIDE.

02:22:27.939 --> 02:22:29.440
NOT INSIDE ANYMORE THAT IT'S

02:22:29.507 --> 02:22:31.976
HARD I THINK FOR US TO SIT HERE

02:22:32.043 --> 02:22:33.845
AND IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE. AND

02:22:33.912 --> 02:22:37.849
THE TRAUMA AND THE FEAR. INSIDE

02:22:37.916 --> 02:22:39.817
SO THE THIS COMMITTEE HASN'T

02:22:39.884 --> 02:22:41.486
ALWAYS FOCUSED ON THE

02:22:41.552 --> 02:22:43.054
INSTITUTIONS FOR WOMEN AND THAT

02:22:43.121 --> 02:22:44.789
IS ONE OF MY SUGGESTIONS BUT

02:22:44.856 --> 02:22:45.957
I'M TEARS THAT WE TAKE A LOOK

02:22:46.024 --> 02:22:47.659
AT THAT. AND SEE IF THERE'S A

02:22:47.725 --> 02:22:49.794
WAY THAT WE CAN. GET BETTER

02:22:49.861 --> 02:22:52.196
INFORMATION. IN A PRODUCTIVE

02:22:52.263 --> 02:22:53.398
WAY ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:22:53.464 --> 02:22:54.999
THERE SO IF THERE'S AN

02:22:55.066 --> 02:22:57.135
INVESTIGATION THAT HAS ANY

02:22:57.201 --> 02:22:59.671
POSSIBILITY. OF BEING DEALT

02:22:59.737 --> 02:23:01.673
WITH INSIDE. I THINK THAT'S

02:23:01.739 --> 02:23:02.607
GOING TO CHANGE VERY

02:23:02.674 --> 02:23:05.076
DRAMATICALLY THE CHARACTER OF

02:23:05.143 --> 02:23:05.877
SOMEBODY WHO IS INSIDE A WOMAN

02:23:05.944 --> 02:23:07.578
WHO'S INSIDE. THEIR WILLINGNESS

02:23:07.645 --> 02:23:09.547
TO COME FORWARD AT ALL IN THE

02:23:09.614 --> 02:23:12.583
FIRST PLACE. BECAUSE OF THAT

02:23:12.650 --> 02:23:14.619
THAT IF IT. THAT FEAR WILL BE I

02:23:14.686 --> 02:23:15.887
THINK VERY DEBILITATING TO THE

02:23:15.954 --> 02:23:17.655
CASE IF THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE

02:23:17.722 --> 02:23:18.923
THAT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AN

02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:21.192
OUTSIDE INVESTIGATION. AND

02:23:21.259 --> 02:23:22.193
PRINT AND THE ABILITY TO

02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:23.761
PROTECT THEM FROM RETALIATION

02:23:23.828 --> 02:23:25.229
ALTHOUGH I THINK THE CULTURE IS

02:23:25.296 --> 02:23:25.964
SUCH THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:27.799
BELIEVE. THAT YOU CAN SAY THE

02:23:27.865 --> 02:23:29.434
REGULATIONS CAN SAY AND THE

02:23:29.500 --> 02:23:31.402
STRUCTURE CAN BE THAT THEY WILL

02:23:31.469 --> 02:23:33.071
BE PROTECTED FROM ITALIAN ASIAN

02:23:33.137 --> 02:23:34.706
THEY WILL NOT BELIEVE. IF

02:23:34.772 --> 02:23:36.474
THEY'RE STILL CARING THAT FEAR

02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:39.577
ONCE THEY COME OUT. I DON'T SEE

02:23:39.644 --> 02:23:40.178
HOW THEY ON THE ANYONE ON THE

02:23:40.244 --> 02:23:42.847
INSIDE. WE'LL WE'LL BE ABLE TO

02:23:42.914 --> 02:23:44.615
TRUST OF THAT UNTIL THAT

02:23:44.682 --> 02:23:47.151
PROCESS STARTS TO SHOW REAL

02:23:47.218 --> 02:23:49.821
RESULTS. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT

02:23:49.887 --> 02:23:50.888
THIS COMMITTEE COULD TAKE A

02:23:50.955 --> 02:23:51.789
LITTLE BIT LOOK AND LET'S I

02:23:51.856 --> 02:23:53.524
THINK WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT.

02:23:53.591 --> 02:23:54.492
THE FACILITIES FOR WOMEN

02:23:54.559 --> 02:23:56.394
SPECIFICALLY AND MAYBE THIS

02:23:56.461 --> 02:23:58.930
COMMITTEE AND OR PUBLIC SAFETY

02:23:58.997 --> 02:24:01.366
AND SEE IF WE CAN GET A BETTER

02:24:01.432 --> 02:24:03.067
SENSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. HOW

02:24:03.134 --> 02:24:04.502
IT'S HAPPENING. AND HOW WE

02:24:04.569 --> 02:24:07.672
REALLY FIND A TRULY INDEPENDENT

02:24:07.739 --> 02:24:09.507
AND EFFECTIVE WAY OF GETTING

02:24:09.574 --> 02:24:11.409
THE STORIES TOLD AND THEN

02:24:11.476 --> 02:24:13.077
STARTING TO DRIVE THAT. TO

02:24:13.144 --> 02:24:14.946
DRIVE THAT CHANGE SO IT'S THOSE

02:24:15.013 --> 02:24:16.447
PATTERNS THAT WERE TRYING TO

02:24:16.514 --> 02:24:17.849
BREAK DOWN THOSE PATTERNS THAT

02:24:17.915 --> 02:24:18.549
HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED A LONG

02:24:18.616 --> 02:24:22.854
TIME. AND THE INSTITUTION. BOTH

02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:24.589
THE THAT THE WOMEN HER IN THE

02:24:24.655 --> 02:24:25.823
INSTITUTION AN INSTITUTION

02:24:25.890 --> 02:24:29.227
ITSELF HAVE RELIED ON. THOSE

02:24:29.293 --> 02:24:31.496
PATTERNS FOR SO LONG THAT

02:24:31.562 --> 02:24:32.764
BREAKING THOSE PATTERNS OF

02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:34.899
BREAKING THE EXPECTATIONS I

02:24:34.966 --> 02:24:36.801
DON'T THINK IS GOING TO BE AN

02:24:36.868 --> 02:24:39.871
EASY TASK AT ALL- ESPECIALLY

02:24:39.937 --> 02:24:42.874
WHEN PEOPLE ARE SO AFRAID TO

02:24:42.940 --> 02:24:45.576
COME FORWARD. SO I. I'M VERY

02:24:45.643 --> 02:24:46.677
INTERESTED TO SEE THE

02:24:46.744 --> 02:24:48.312
REGULATIONS I THINK WE NEED TO

02:24:48.379 --> 02:24:50.248
SEE THE REGULATIONS. BUT IF

02:24:50.314 --> 02:24:52.450
THOSE REGULATIONS DO NOT FOSTER

02:24:52.517 --> 02:24:53.818
ENOUGH OF A GUARANTEE OF THAT

02:24:53.885 --> 02:24:55.853
INDEPENDENCE OF THAT OUTSIDE

02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:58.589
LOOK AND THAT REAL SENSE OF

02:24:58.656 --> 02:25:00.525
PROTECTION FROM RETALIATION AND

02:25:00.591 --> 02:25:01.492
THAT'D BE DEMONSTRATED THAT TO

02:25:01.559 --> 02:25:02.727
BE ARTICULATED AND THAT

02:25:02.794 --> 02:25:04.495
DEMONSTRATED. I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:25:04.562 --> 02:25:05.863
WE'RE GOING TO GET THE

02:25:05.930 --> 02:25:07.565
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY

02:25:07.632 --> 02:25:11.302
HAPPENING. IN THE CASES THAT WE

02:25:11.369 --> 02:25:12.703
NEED TO UNDERSTAND. THIS OF THE

02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:13.404
CRISIS THAT THAT I FEEL IS

02:25:13.471 --> 02:25:18.176
THERE. BUT IS NOT ABLE TO BE

02:25:18.242 --> 02:25:19.877
REALLY EXPLAIN THAT AT THE

02:25:19.944 --> 02:25:21.345
LEVEL THAT I THAT I THINK WILL

02:25:21.412 --> 02:25:22.647
BE HELPFUL BECAUSE IF IT'S AT

02:25:22.713 --> 02:25:24.515
ALL PARTIALLY TRUE IT IS

02:25:24.582 --> 02:25:27.752
FRIGHTENING AND IF THE WHAT I'M

02:25:27.819 --> 02:25:29.520
HEARING IF IT SEEMS AS

02:25:29.587 --> 02:25:31.756
PERVASIVE AS IT IS ENTIRELY

02:25:31.823 --> 02:25:33.391
UNACCEPTABLE AND REALLY

02:25:33.458 --> 02:25:36.060
ABSOLUTELY OUT OF CONTROL SO I

02:25:36.127 --> 02:25:37.695
UNDERSTAND YOUR PROCESS AND

02:25:37.762 --> 02:25:40.031
SETTING THE REGULATIONS. BUT

02:25:40.098 --> 02:25:41.966
FOR ME I THINK IT I THINK BY

02:25:42.033 --> 02:25:43.101
HOPEFULLY FOR THIS COMMITTEE

02:25:43.167 --> 02:25:45.736
THAT IF WE'RE NOT COMFORTABLE

02:25:45.803 --> 02:25:47.371
WITH THE LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE

02:25:47.438 --> 02:25:49.807
THAT'S THERE THAT THAT'S NOT

02:25:49.874 --> 02:25:51.576
GOING TO BE ACCEPTABLE HERE AND

02:25:51.642 --> 02:25:53.010
IS NOT GOING TO FLY BECAUSE

02:25:53.077 --> 02:25:53.444
THAT'S GOING TO BE A

02:25:53.511 --> 02:25:55.947
CORNERSTONE TO REALLY BEING

02:25:56.013 --> 02:25:57.482
ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE

02:25:57.548 --> 02:25:59.784
INFORMATION AND TO THAT THE

02:25:59.851 --> 02:26:01.953
STATE OF WHAT'S INSIDE INSIDE.

02:26:02.019 --> 02:26:03.754
I THINK IT'S BEEN. IT'S GONE ON

02:26:03.821 --> 02:26:05.990
FOR SO LONG TIME. THAT WITHOUT

02:26:06.057 --> 02:26:07.525
A REAL DRAMATIC STATE WITH THE

02:26:07.592 --> 02:26:08.593
THESE REGULATIONS SHOULD NOT BE

02:26:08.659 --> 02:26:10.862
JUST. A NEXT STEP. AND OPENING

02:26:10.928 --> 02:26:12.263
AWAY YET BUT SHOULD BE A

02:26:12.330 --> 02:26:14.732
DRAMATIC STEP TO SHOW THAT THE

02:26:14.799 --> 02:26:17.201
DEPARTMENT THAT WE- EVERYONE IS

02:26:17.268 --> 02:26:19.637
VERY VERY SERIOUS ABOUT. MAKING

02:26:19.704 --> 02:26:21.472
THAT THE KINDS OF CULTURAL

02:26:21.539 --> 02:26:24.275
STRUCTURAL THOSE CHANGES. TO

02:26:24.342 --> 02:26:26.878
ENSURE. THE SAFETY ON THE

02:26:26.944 --> 02:26:29.647
INSIDE. SO I HAVE. SOMEONE

02:26:29.714 --> 02:26:33.351
STONE. WE HAVE SOME WOMEN WE'VE

02:26:33.417 --> 02:26:35.520
BEEN TALKING TO AT THE

02:26:35.586 --> 02:26:36.954
CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR

02:26:37.021 --> 02:26:39.023
WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING

02:26:39.090 --> 02:26:40.324
FOR PUBLICLY IF YOU WANT TO

02:26:40.391 --> 02:26:42.193
KNOW IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO

02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:44.128
THEM WE'LL BE HAPPY TO GO DOWN

02:26:44.195 --> 02:26:46.130
THERE WITH YOU AND- I THINK

02:26:46.197 --> 02:26:48.699
THEY WOULD PROBABLY- BE WILLING

02:26:48.766 --> 02:26:49.667
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME OF

02:26:49.734 --> 02:26:52.303
THE- ISSUES THAT THEY MAY.

02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:53.237
BECAUSE I'M HEARING THIS FROM

02:26:53.304 --> 02:26:55.173
SOME FOLKS TO INSIDE AND WHEN

02:26:55.239 --> 02:26:56.541
THEY'RE REELING BACK TO ME SO I

02:26:56.607 --> 02:26:58.376
WOULD HAVE YOU I THINK. FROM

02:26:58.442 --> 02:27:01.345
THIS COMMITTEE FORMALLY. SHOULD

02:27:01.412 --> 02:27:03.014
MAKE THAT REQUESTED A

02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:06.417
POTENTIALLY GO DO SOME TOURS IN

02:27:06.484 --> 02:27:08.252
AND SORT OF SEE WHAT. WHAT WE

02:27:08.319 --> 02:27:10.221
CAN DO BECAUSE I ALSO IT FOR

02:27:10.288 --> 02:27:12.356
ALL THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE

02:27:12.423 --> 02:27:13.291
WITH THE REHABILITATION SIDE

02:27:13.357 --> 02:27:16.227
AND- THE REFORMS AND ALL THAT

02:27:16.294 --> 02:27:18.229
THE MESSAGE THAT I'M GETTING

02:27:18.296 --> 02:27:18.796
BACK IN AGAIN THIS IS THIRD

02:27:18.863 --> 02:27:22.266
HAND. THEY'RE NOT FEELING. ANY

02:27:22.333 --> 02:27:23.534
APPROPRIATE ATTENTION BEING

02:27:23.601 --> 02:27:25.169
PAID IN THE WOMEN'S FACILITIES

02:27:25.236 --> 02:27:26.204
BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING MORE

02:27:26.270 --> 02:27:27.772
GENERALLY. AND I THINK THAT'S

02:27:27.838 --> 02:27:29.640
SOMETHING THAT THAT WE NEEDED

02:27:29.707 --> 02:27:31.576
LEGISLATURE TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

02:27:31.642 --> 02:27:32.910
FOR ADDRESSING THE FACT THAT WE

02:27:32.977 --> 02:27:34.712
HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN. THERE AND

02:27:34.779 --> 02:27:37.248
BEEN AVAILABLE AND I THINK IF

02:27:37.315 --> 02:27:38.416
WE TAKE SOME SOME MORE FROM HIS

02:27:38.482 --> 02:27:40.885
STEPS AND SHOW THAT THERE'S-

02:27:40.952 --> 02:27:41.786
ATTENTION BEING PAID THAT WE'RE

02:27:41.852 --> 02:27:42.820
WILLING TO LISTEN AND BE A PART

02:27:42.887 --> 02:27:45.223
OF THIS PROCESS. I THINK JUST

02:27:45.289 --> 02:27:47.425
THAT WILL WILL ALSO. GO A LONG

02:27:47.491 --> 02:27:49.026
WAYS BUT ALSO MISS SECTOR I'M

02:27:49.093 --> 02:27:50.228
I'M HOPING THAT WHAT YOU

02:27:50.294 --> 02:27:53.231
PERCENT AND I THINK THAT. WHAT

02:27:53.297 --> 02:27:53.798
WE WOULD EXPECT IS SOMETHING

02:27:53.864 --> 02:27:58.469
THAT IS. EVEN BEYOND KIND OF

02:27:58.536 --> 02:28:00.805
CURRENT STATUS BUT IS THE WITH

02:28:00.871 --> 02:28:02.006
THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF

02:28:02.073 --> 02:28:04.208
INDEPENDENCE OF REVIEW BECAUSE

02:28:04.275 --> 02:28:05.443
IT'S GOING TO BE A CREDIBILITY

02:28:05.509 --> 02:28:07.745
QUESTION FOR THAT WHOLE SYSTEM

02:28:07.812 --> 02:28:09.614
RIGHT I AGREE AND APPRECIATE

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:11.382
BOTH YOUR COMMENTS AND I TAKE

02:28:11.449 --> 02:28:12.583
THAT VERY SERIOUSLY TO THE I

02:28:12.650 --> 02:28:15.486
MEAN I TO THE POINT TO WHERE I.

02:28:15.553 --> 02:28:19.257
KNEW I WAS GOING TO BE HERE.THEN I SENT OUT- THE LINK TO

02:28:19.323 --> 02:28:20.358
THIS HEARING TO ALL THE WARDEN

02:28:20.424 --> 02:28:22.126
SO THEY CAN UNDERSTAND THE

02:28:22.193 --> 02:28:22.727
IMPORTANCE OF THE SO THEY CAN

02:28:22.793 --> 02:28:24.962
SEE. WHAT WE'RE DOING WHAT

02:28:25.029 --> 02:28:25.529
WE'RE DISCUSSING THAT IT IS

02:28:25.596 --> 02:28:27.365
IMPORTANT. ONE OF THESE

02:28:27.431 --> 02:28:29.934
ALLEGATIONS IS FAR TOO MANY.

02:28:30.001 --> 02:28:31.369
THAT WERE FAR TOO MANY I TAKE

02:28:31.435 --> 02:28:34.772
IT VERY SERIOUSLY- YES WE ARE

02:28:34.839 --> 02:28:36.574
SEEKING FUNDING FOR CAMERAS IN

02:28:36.641 --> 02:28:37.942
THESE FACILITIES TO EXPAND OUR

02:28:38.009 --> 02:28:40.878
CAMERAS ON THE YARDS AT RJD. AT

02:28:40.945 --> 02:28:42.546
THE WOMEN'S FACILITY AT C. O.

02:28:42.613 --> 02:28:45.016
W. AT SALINAS VALLEY. TO ASSIST

02:28:45.082 --> 02:28:47.018
WITH SOME OF THESE CULTURAL

02:28:47.084 --> 02:28:49.787
ISSUES. BUT YOU KNOW LIKE YOU

02:28:49.854 --> 02:28:51.255
SITTING HERE LISTENING TO THE

02:28:51.322 --> 02:28:52.657
CRITICISMS OF THE AGENCY THAT I

02:28:52.723 --> 02:28:53.924
BELIEVE IS DOING GOOD WORK BUT

02:28:53.991 --> 02:28:58.262
DEFINITELY CAN BE DOING BETTER-IT DOES AFFECT ME. YOU KNOW NOT

02:28:58.329 --> 02:28:59.263
ONLY IS PROFESSIONAL BUT

02:28:59.330 --> 02:29:00.731
PERSONALLY. BECAUSE I CARE

02:29:00.798 --> 02:29:02.600
ABOUT THE POPULATION I DO CARE

02:29:02.667 --> 02:29:03.734
ABOUT THESE PRISONS I DO CARE

02:29:03.801 --> 02:29:05.469
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE PRODUCING ONCE

02:29:05.536 --> 02:29:07.938
A RELEASE. AND I'M SAD TO HEAR

02:29:08.005 --> 02:29:10.207
ABOUT. THE STORIES OF PEOPLE

02:29:10.274 --> 02:29:11.642
LEAVING IT ONLY WANT TO TALK

02:29:11.709 --> 02:29:13.577
ABOUT I EXPERIENCE. OTHER

02:29:13.644 --> 02:29:14.779
STORIES THAT ARE OPPOSITE OF

02:29:14.845 --> 02:29:15.746
THAT SO I'M SURE SOMEWHERE IN

02:29:15.813 --> 02:29:18.015
THE MIDDLE THAT WE NEED TO

02:29:18.082 --> 02:29:21.385
IMPROVE THAT. OBVIOUSLY MOST OF

02:29:21.452 --> 02:29:24.588
US ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE. OF

02:29:24.655 --> 02:29:25.623
THE REGULATIONS AND SO I'M

02:29:25.690 --> 02:29:26.457
GOING TO SUGGEST THAT THE THAT

02:29:26.524 --> 02:29:28.359
YOU BEFORE YOU SUBMIT THEM THAT

02:29:28.426 --> 02:29:29.226

THEM. AND THAT WE HAVE AN

02:29:30.828 --> 02:29:33.030
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SOME.

02:29:33.097 --> 02:29:34.765
PRIOR TO THE SUBMIT AND MEAN IT

02:29:34.832 --> 02:29:35.866
YOU KNOW WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE

02:29:35.933 --> 02:29:37.835
THE FORT SUBMIT IT. RATHER THAN

02:29:37.902 --> 02:29:38.803
HAVING TO RESPOND TO IT AFTER

02:29:38.869 --> 02:29:41.038
THE FACT. AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN

02:29:41.105 --> 02:29:43.307
IT SO- WE WOULD LIKE TO. BE

02:29:43.374 --> 02:29:46.210
ABLE TO WEIGH IN ON IT AND A-

02:29:46.277 --> 02:29:49.847
GET SOME SENSE OF- FEELING THAT

02:29:49.914 --> 02:29:51.115
IT THAT IT IS SO. THAT IS

02:29:51.182 --> 02:29:53.584
ACCEPTABLE. AS YOU SINCE IT'S

02:29:53.651 --> 02:29:55.386

ANOTHER WE COULD TO WON'T GO

02:29:56.854 --> 02:29:58.356

02:29:58.422 --> 02:29:59.790
I'M I'M NOT SURE THE MECHANICS

02:29:59.857 --> 02:30:02.493

BELIEVE ANY REVIEW THERE I

02:30:08.499 --> 02:30:09.367
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

02:30:09.433 --> 02:30:11.435
CONTACTS WITH EXPLANATION. SURE
