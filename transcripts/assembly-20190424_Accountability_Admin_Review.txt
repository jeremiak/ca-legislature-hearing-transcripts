ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER KILEY OKAY MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM. NUMBER -- FIVE WITH. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AB TEN TWENTY SIX TO ESTABLISH A STATE HOUSING AGENCY WITH THE CABINET LEVEL SECRETARY CHARGED WITH OVERSEEING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO HOUSING. CURRENTLY THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERSIGHT OF NUMEROUS DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT HOWEVER THE LEADING DEPARTMENT REQUIRING THE MOST RESOURCES IS THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS WHICH CONSISTS OF MORE THAN FOR FORTY BUREAUS BOARDS COMMITTEES COMMISSIONS AND OTHER ENTITIES. A NEW HOUSING AGENCY WOULD HELP FOCUS THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT HOUSING SUPPLY CRISIS WITH ME TODAY IS JENNIFER SPEC FROM CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. BUT I'M SURE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT STAKE WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S DEDICATION TO HELPING US WITH A HOUSING SUPPLY -- IS CLEAR BASED UPON RECENT THE RECENT ELECTION OF THE NEED FOR ADEQUATE STABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HOUSING IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST PARTISAN COPPER CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES. THE EXPENDITURE UP ON HOUSING IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS FOR CALIFORNIANS WHEN THEY UNDERTAKE THAT IN THEIR DAY TO DAY LIVES FOR THE MORE HOUSING AND HOUSING RELATED ACTIVITIES ARE PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE. AND IT WARRANTS A CLEAR AND UNIFIED FOCUS FROM STATE GOVERNMENT AND THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION WITHIN OUR AGENCY STRUCTURE. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE VOTE. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

I THIS DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WHICH LIKE TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS PETRIE-NORRIS HI PETRIE-NORRIS I PATTERSON. PATTERSON HI BURKE. LACKEY LACKEY HI MEDINA MEDINA HI KIRK SILVA. SMITH. WE WILL PUT THAT FELL ON CALL TO NAVAL OTHER MEMBERS DATA THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] OKAY WELL AS OF HELLO MISTER OBERNOLTE. WE ARE WE ARE READY FOR YOU MOVING ON TO FILE NUMBER EIGHT MR OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES PLAY. THE AND THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES EMPLOY OVER FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. OVER HALF OF EMPLOYEES AND CALIFORNIA WORK FOR A SMALL BUSINESS AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT OVER HALF OF THE JOB GROWTH IN THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS WILL BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SMALL BUSINESSES. HOWEVER SMALL BUSINESSES OFTEN STRUGGLE IN CALIFORNIA'S COMPLEX REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT LARGE COMPANIES CAN AFFORD TO EMPLOY A FULL TIME PEOPLE WHO JUST DEAL WITH COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS WERE SMALL BUSINESSES. REALLY HAVE TO PLAY MULTIPLE ROLES AND DON'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE AWARE OF ALL THE REGULATIONS SOMETIMES THAT AFFECT THEM. AB FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE IS A SMALL EFFORT TO COMBAT THIS PROBLEM. IN RESEARCHING THIS BILL I'VE COME ACROSS SOME REALLY HORRIFYING TALES. OF WAYS IN WHICH BUSINESSES HAS BEEN HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY CALIFORNIA'S REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF ONE I TALKED TO A WOMAN IN VACAVILLE. WHO? REALIZED HER DREAM OF OPENING HER OWN RESTAURANT IN IT AND SHE OPENED IT IT ON HISTORIC BUILDING OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD. I SHE WAS SUBJECT TO A INSPECTION BY SEVERAL DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES THEY DIDN'T FIND ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE SAFETY OF HER FOOD PREPARATION BUT THEY DID FIND A NUMBER. OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE BUSINESS THE ENVIRONMENT THAT SHE WAS LOCATED IN THIS HUNDRED YEAR OLD BUILDING THE SHOOTER FINES TOTALING ELEVEN THE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND IT WILL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT ONE OF THE FINES WAS -- FOR MISSING A PLASTIC CAP ON AN ELECTRIC OUTLET THAT FINE WAS FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS AND SHE WHEN SHE TALKED TO ME SHE WAS IN TEARS SHE SAID. IF THEY HAD JUST TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED TO PUT A 25%. SEND COVER ON THIS ELECTRIC OUTLET I WOULD HAVE GLADLY DONE IT BUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OF EXCESS CAPITAL SHE WAS -- SHE WAS FORCED TO CLOSE HER BUSINESS AND IN FACT THE FIVE BUSINESSES IN BACK OF ALL THAT WORKS INSPECTED THAT DAY ALL FIVE OF THEM WERE FORCED TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS SO. AB FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE WOULD PERMIT NOT REQUIRED BUT PERMIT STATE AGENCIES THE DISCRETION. TO REDUCE OUR MEDICAID FINDS IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THOSE APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE VERY NARROWLY TAILORED -- ONLY IN CASES WHERE THE BUSINESS WAS A FIRST TIME VIOLATOR -- ONLY IN CASES WHEN THE BUSINESS OF THE VIOLATION WAS INADVERTENT THE BUSINESS COOPERATED WITH THE INVESTIGATION AND THE VIOLATION WAS CORRECTED ONLY THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD GIVE THE AGENCIES THE DISCRETION TO LOWER THOSE FINES BECAUSE RIGHT NOW MANY OF THOSE FINES ARE FIXED IN STATUTE. THE AGENCY IS DOING THE INSPECTION ONCE THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THE VIOLATIONS OCCURRED THEY HAVE NO DISCRETION IN SETTING THE FINES. SO I THINK THIS IS BEING GREAT THING TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES FLOURISH IN CALIFORNIA AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE JEFF WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT. YES -- GOOD MORNING -- ROB WHICH YOU FOR THE CAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN FORTY FIVE AS A JOB CREATOR -- EXCUSE ME AZIZ ELEMENT TO STATE THE YOU KNOW THAT WE REALLY DO THIS IS INVESTING CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE RIGHT SMALL BUSINESS ARE THE ENGINE OF GROWTH THEY ACCOUNT FOR MOST OF THE JOB GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA. AND ARE NEW TO THE GAME YOU KNOW AND HAVE HUGE PROMISE BUT TO SIT TO SHUT THEM DOWN FOR MISTAKES WHICH YEAH IT'S LIKE INTENSELY THINK. ENDING A CHILD RIGHT THE CHILLS LEARNING IS IMPROVING IS GROWING AND YOU WANT THAT OPTION TO GROW SO WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT -- AND I WILL PROVIDE -- ONE THE ONE OF THE POINT LIKE TO ADD IS THAT REALLY USES THE NATIONAL CONTINUATION OF THE SMALL BUSINESS LIAISON Là WHICH WE ALREADY HAVE ON THE BOOKS WHICH CONNECTS SMALL BUSINESSES RIGHT TO HELP THEM. TAKE THE STEP EIGHTY TAKE THIS ALLOWS THE FINANCIAL COMPONENT THAT SAME SUPPORT TO GO FORWARD WE WILL RELIEVE YOU IS A CONTINUATION OF THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. KIND OF A SMALLISH YEAH COMMITTEE ROOMS MAYBE WE'LL DO A LITTLE MUSICAL CHAIRS. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WERE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL. THAT THIS BILL ALLOWS BUSINESSES THAT ARE CAUGHT VIOLATING THE LAW. TO OBEY FINES AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATING HEALTH SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS. REVIEW THIS BILL IS OVERLY BROAD FOR WANTED TO FIND SMALL BUSINESSES AS ANY COMPANY WITH A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OR LESS THAT ENCOMPASSES 97% CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE EMPLOYERS -- WHICH IS OBVIOUS THE HUGE SCOPE -- IT ALSO APPLIES TO WEAR IT ALSO APPLIES TO EVERY STATE AGENCY DEPARTMENT COMMISSION SORENESS OVER SO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT CAL EPA WOULD -- WOULD HAVE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REDUCE PENALTIES FOR COMPANIES VIOLATING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS THE AT THE AGE REDUCE PENALTIES FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE ENGAGED TO HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION D. I. R. FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE ENGAGED DISTILLING WAGES FOR WORKERS. CAL OSHA FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE ENGAGED IN -- FOR COMPANIES THAT BYERLY WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTION SO THE SCOPE OF THIS IS REALLY REALLY BROUGHT IT ALSO SHIELD SOME OF THE WORST VIOLATORS IN CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY IS MADE UP OF SMALL BUSINESSES SO INDUSTRIES LIKE CONSTRUCTION JANITORIAL AG MOST OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS INSTEAD CALIFORNIA. THAT THAT'S WHY THIS YEAR A CLUB BUILDING TRADES SEIU -- TEAMSTERS A HOST OF BUSINESS A HOST OF WORK ORGANIZATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ARE ALL STRONGLY OPPOSE THE BILL -- IT ALSO DISINCENTIVE EYES IS COMPLIANCE WITH -- WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS SO -- CREATING A SYSTEM WHERE COMPANIES CAN FIRST IGNORE THE LAW AND THEN IF THEY ARE CAUGHT VIOLATING THE LAW CAN BE IMMUNE FROM PENALTIES FOR THAT VIOLATION. IS AND A RIDICULOUS SYSTEM SAID TO CREATE -- IT ALSO -- IT IT MAKES NOT ONLY WORKERS BUT THE PUBLIC LESS SAFE AND ALSO -- IT'S UNCLEAR TO BUSINESSES WERE FOLLOWING THE RULES OF THE BUSINESSES WHO HAVE DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT AND ARE FOLLOWING THE RULES ARE UNFAIR ADVANTAGE FOR THESE COMPANIES WHO CAN GET IMMUNITY FOR VIOLATING THE LAW SO FOR THESE REASONS WERE STRONGLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU SUSKIND CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION AS WELL AN ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MISTER YOUNG -- THE CNA DOES NOT BELIEVE IT'S CLEAR IT THAT ANY ENTITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO ESCAPE PROPERLY IMPLY IMPOSED CIVIL PENALTIES. FOR VIOLATIONS OF CALIFORNIA LAWS MISTER YOUNG STATED IT ALLOWS FOR ONE FREE BITE OF THE APPLE WE DON'T THINK THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE APPROACH THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO OPPOSE THE BILL. DOES TAKE A COUPLE SECONDS AND SAY JUST A COUPLE QUICK A BRIEF REMARKS FIRST OF ALL. MANY CITY AGENCIES ALREADY HAVE A PROCESS. FOR DEALING SITUATIONS WHERE YOU THINK AS A BUSINESS OWNER YOU MAY HAVE BEEN -- NEXT TO OR HELD LIABLE FOR SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE FOR EXAMPLE THE CAL OSHA. PROCESS AS THE CAL OSHA APPEALS BOARD. BROUGH FINES AND PENALTIES ARE ROUTINELY LOWERED -- IN THAT ARENA OTHER SEVERAL OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIE OTHER AGENTS AS WELL SECONDLY THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY IN THE STATE IS A VAST BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. UNFORTUNATELY FOLKS LIKE MICHAEL AND I NEED TO BE HERE TO LEGISLATE IN PASS REGULATIONS AND PASS LAWS FOR THE VAST NUMBER OF BUSINESSES THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THAT DON'T PLAY BY THE RULES. THAT ARE GOING TO IGNORE NO MATTER WHAT. WHAT THEY DO AND AS A COST OF DOING BUSINESS? RIGHT THAT INTO THEIR BOTTOM LINE THEY'LL PAY A PENALTY IF IF THEY GET CAUGHT -- IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THERE ARE SOME GOOD BUSINESSES THAT MIGHT GET CAUGHT UP USING THE TROUBLE OBERNOLTE EXAMPLE. IN SITUATIONS THAT THEY MADE AN HONEST MISTAKE BUT WE CAN'T -- FORGET ABOUT THE VAST UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THAT IT EXISTS IN THE STATE FULL OF BAD EMPLOYERS AND FINALLY ALL SAY -- I CAN SPEAK MOST CULTURALLY ABOUT CAL OSHA. A CAL OSHA STAFF WHEN WE DO REGULATIONS A CAL OSHA THEY ARE ALSO THE SAME STAFFERS THERE IN THE FIELD. DOING INSPECTIONS SO. SO. TAKING MORE OF THEIR TIME OUT OF THEIR WORK DAY TO TALK TO EMPLOYERS ABOUT WHETHER THEY MEANT TO MAKE A MISTAKE WHETHER THEY DIDN'T NEED TO MAKE A MISTAKE. AND FIGURING OUT. WHAT IT MEANS IN THEIR MIND? WELL WHETHER THEY SHOULD GET -- NEXT FOR A FINE OR NOT TAKES THAT VITAL STEP AWAY FROM I'M DOING THE WORK THEY NEED TO DO IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY MAKING SURE BAD EMPLOYERS ARE HELD TO ACCOUNT. SO THAT GOOD EMPLOYERS DON'T HAVE TO COMPETE. ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD -- TO TO MAKE TO MAKE A LIVING THE STATE SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS IN THE ONCE PREVIOUSLY STATED WERE OPPOSED THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ARE A PART OF SCO YOU CALIFORNIA JUST A REAL QUICKLY IN THE JANITORIAL SEIU CALIFORNIA IN THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY WE DEAL WITH BAD ACTORS ALL THE TIME SO THESE ARE BUSINESSES. THEY KNOW HOW TO VIOLATE THE LAW THE KNOW HOW TO WORK THE RULES I CAN JUST IMAGINE IN THIS SITUATION WHERE THEY WOULD CHANGE. BUSINESS ENTITY ALL THE TIME TO GET A FREEBIE ON VIOLATIONS ALL THE TIME I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY DURABLE I THINK SOME OF THE WORST BUSINESS IN THE STATE WILL. DEFINITELY UTILIZE THAT OPTION SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE OPPOSE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. AT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE. I ARE THERE QUESTIONS SORRY SOMEONE ELSE HERE. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS QUIRK SILVA. OUR I EIGHT MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD BECAUSE OF NOT ONLY THE MANY BUSINESSES THAT HAVE APPROACHED ME. UP HERE -- IN THE STATE BUT ALSO IN MY DISTRICT JUST OVER SPRING BREAK I HAD ABOUT TWELVE BUSINESSES VERY SMALL THAT CAME IN TO SPEAK TO US ABOUT SOME OF THESE EXAMPLES. AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO OUR TO LABOR FRIENDS I UNDERSTAND -- THAT WE DO HAVE THE BATTLE PULLS IN WHETHER IT'S IN TEACHING OR CORPORATIONS OR THE MEDICAL FIELD THERE'S ALWAYS A BAD CHARACTER. ON BUT I THINK THAT -- WHEN WE WORK TOWARDS THE HIGHEST LEVEL INSTEAD OF THE LOWEST LEVEL WE BRING EVERYBODY UP IN ONE OF THE THINGS AND WE START TO LOOK AT -- LABOR AND EMPLOYERS IT'S GOT TO BE A BALANCE THERE'S GOT TO BE A BALANCE WITH EMPLOYER. AND EMPLOYEE AND WE WANT THEM ALL TO RISE AND LIKE I SAID. A NINETY FOUR YEAR OLD. RESTAURANT OWNER IN FULLERTON -- EDDIE SHELDRICK WHO OWNS -- THE POLIS PIES AND FULLER. TEN II HE SAID YOU KNOW HE HAD A VIOLATION BECAUSE HE'S ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES DIDN'T WEAR THE RIGHT SHOES AND THAT AND ONCE THAT START IT BECOMES LIKE A SNOWBALL EFFECT WHERE. YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO SETTLE AND THE YOU KNOW THEN THAT BECOMES OTHERS THAT ARE MAKING THE SAME CLAIMS. AND IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESSES AS BEEN SAID MANY TIMES WHY DO THEY WANT TO DO BUSINESS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I JUST FEEL THAT WERE AT THE TIPPING POINT OF IF LESS WE CAN HAVE THAT SUPPORT OF EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER -- WE'RE GOING TO KIND OF PUSH PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR BUSINESSES AND THAT DOES NOT MEAN I DON'T RESPECT. THE WORKERS RIGHTS AND SAFETY AND ALL THOSE BY AYE THIS THIS IS A BILL I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS MESSAGE. I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY NO I PREVIOUSLY IN JEDI MOVED TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE -- AND ALL TO BE GETS IS CONSISTENT DO SO AGAIN TODAY I DO THINK OUR FRIENDS IN THE LABOR COMMITTEE RAISE SOME SOME FAIR INVALID POINTS THAT PERHAPS WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THAT AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD -- I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW THE BAD ACTORS AND IT'S VERY HARD TO LEGISLATE AROUND THOSE SPECIFIC SET OF FOLKS BUT I'M NOT UNLIKE MY COLLEAGUE I FIND CONSISTENTLY IN MY DISTRICT THAT FOLKS ARE SAYING. THE REGULATORY BURDENS AND THE ABILITY JUST TO DEAL WITH THE REGULATORY PROCESS HAVE BECOME SO CUMBERSOME THAT THE CHALLENGES OF BEING A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER ARE ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR SO MANY PEOPLE AND WE KNOW. HOW MANY FOLKS ARE EMPLOYED IN OUR SMALL BUSINESS SECTOR ACROSS THE STATE SO AGAIN TO BE CONSISTENT MAY GO AHEAD SUPPORT THE MEASURE TODAY I'M HOPEFUL THAT AS WE MOVE ALONG OUR FRIENDS CONCERNS -- FROM LABOR CAN BE ACCOMMODATED IN AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS THAT THANK YOU. MR LACKEY YEAH I JUST WONDER REAL QUICKLY ADDRESS THE ACCUSATION THAT THIS BILL -- WOULD SHIELD THAT ACTORS AND I DO NOT BELIEVE IN ANY. WAY SHAPE OR FORM THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A DISCRETIONARY BILL LIKE THIS. THAT -- THAT IS VERY LIKELY TO HER AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THAT YOUR CLOTHES I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. SO AB I WOULD ALSO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF OF SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO BUILDING THRIVING COMMUNITIES TO CREATING GOOD JOBS. FIVE IN BUILDING STRONG CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. I THINK ALL OF US I THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PROTECTING BAD ACTORS AND THAT. HI BUT THAT WE'RE WRITING POLICIES AND ESTABLISHING LIES THAT. ENABLED THE GOOD BUSINESSES TO THRIVE -- AND HELP WITH THAT FOR ME WHILE I ABSOLUTELY HERE AND APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION FOR ME. I'M I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT I THINK HAS BEEN. A VERY STRONG EFFORT ON YOUR PART TO KEEP THIS AS YOU SAID VERY NARROWLY FOCUSED AND JUST LOOKING AT THAT THE BILL LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW SO IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS. THE VIOLATION BY THE SMALL BUSINESS BUSINESS DID NOT POSE AN IMMINENT HEALTH SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT. I AM SO WELL I THINK WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. LOOSENING UP REGULATIONS TO MATCH WE ALSO HAVE TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE. GOOD SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CAN THRIVE BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO CREATE GOOD JOBS FOR CALIFORNIA AS YOU SAID. 97% OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS ARE WORKING FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE HARD TO FIND A SMALL BUSINESSES. I'M. TO I WOULD ASO ECHO MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS AND THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT AS THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH THAT YOU CONTINUE. TO ENGAGE WITH THE OPPOSITION AND TO ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS AND I THINK. ALLEVIATE THE FEAR THAT THIS IS KIND OF AN END RUN ON AND WORKERS RIGHTS ARE AROUND WORKERS PROTECTIONS BECAUSE I CERTAINLY DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY AND I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING IT. IF I DID BUT AT TODAY I I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS ABOUT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I WILL TALK ABOUT THE ASSERTION THAT PERHAPS THIS MIGHT WEEKEND. WORKERS RIGHTS OR WORKER SAFETY. WE WERE VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE CRAFTED THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE THE CASE STORE -- IT AND WE ALSO I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT TO PROVIDE A SHIELD FOR A BAD ACTOR AND I I HOPE THAT WE'VE DONE THAT BECAUSE THE BILL SAYS THAT THE VIOLATION FIRST OF ALL HAS TO BE IN A BURDEN SO IF IT WAS A WILLFUL VIOLATION. WAS COMPANIES WOULD NOT QUALIFY I SAYS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE A FIRST TIME VIOLATORS SO IF YOU'RE ONE OF THESE BAD ACTORS THAT IS. A SUFFERING REPEAT VIOLATIONS YOU WOULD NOT QUALIFY ALSO IT'S DISCRETIONARY SO DOES WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT ANY DEPARTMENT MUST REDUCE OR MITIGATE THE FIGHTS WE'RE JUST GIVING THEM. THE POWER TO REDUCE OR MITIGATE THE FINES IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE'RE TRUSTING THAT THE DEPARTMENT IN THE COURSE OF THEIR INVESTIGATION WOULD DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THESE VIOLATIONS WERE MINOR DIDN'T IMPACT THE SAFETY OF THE WORKERS WERE INADVERTENT. AND ONLY IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES TAKE THAT THE STEP OF OF REDUCING OUR MITIGATING THE PENALTY. SO I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION SHOULD THE BILL MOVE FORWARD IN PARTICULAR THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD. THE THE CONCERN THAT PERHAPS IT'S TO BROADEN THE DEFINITION OF SMALL BUSINESS HAPPY TO LOOK AT THAT MAYBE A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES IS NOT THE RIGHT NUMBER MAYBE THE NUMBER SHOULD BE LOWER SO -- SHOULD THE BILL MOVED TO APPROPRIATIONS THAT'S A DISCUSSION THAT I'M HAPPY TO HAVE AND I'M ALSO MY MY DOORS ALWAYS OPEN. IF ANYONE HAS SUGGESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO TIGHTEN UP THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BAD ACTORS DON'T SLIP THROUGH.
