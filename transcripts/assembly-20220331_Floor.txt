ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE SIXTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BALLOT ERRORS RELATIVE TO WORLD AUTISM AWARENESS DAY ASSEMBLY. YOUR RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS TODAY I RISE PROUDLY TO PRESENT ACR ONE SIXTY FIVE WHICH COMMEMORATES APRIL SECOND AS WORLD AUTISM AWARENESS DAY. AUTISM IS BECOMING ONE OF THE MOST COMMON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AFFECTING PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. TWENTY TWENTY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES REPORTED THAT APPROXIMATELY ONE OUT OF EVERY FIFTY FOUR CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES IS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM. AUTISM AFFECTS PEOPLE FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS BUT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES DUE TO THE COST AN INACCESSIBILITY OF NECESSARY RESOURCES. INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM OFTEN REQUIRE A LIFETIME OF SPECIALIZED MEDICAL AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT SERVICES TO INSURE THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY. AS A RESULT MEICAL EXPENSES FOR CHILDREN WITH AUTISM ARE TYPICALLY FOUR TO SIX TIMES GREATER THAN THEIR PEERS. ADDITIONALLY YOUNG ADULTS WITH AUTISM ARE LESS LIKELY TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION PASSED SECONDARY SCHOOL AND 25% DO NOT HAVE A JOB OR PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION AFTER LEAVING HIGH SCHOOL. BECAUSE OF ITS PREVALENCE AND THE COSTS ARE TO AUTISM COMPOSE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE DEDICATE TIME TO HELPING CALIFORNIANS BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE IN THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZE FULLY FUNDING OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEMS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES REGARDLESS OF INCOME ARE ABLE TO FIND QUALITY RESOURCES FOR THEIR CHILDREN WITH AUTISM. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE IN THE LEGISLATURE WORK ON MEASURES THAT IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THOSE WITH AUTISM AND THEIR FAMILIES SO THAT THEY CAN ALL REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR MANY OF US BECAUSE IT TOUCHES THE LIVES OF MANY OF OUR KEY CONSTITUENTS AND EVEN IMPACTS SOME OF US DIRECTLY SIXTEEN YEARS AGO GO I WAS SITTING IN THE BACK OF A CAR WITH MY MOM ARE SITTING IN THE FRONT F THE CAR WITH MY MOM AND IN THE BACKSEAT WAS MY TWO YEAR OLD SLEEPING NIECE. WHO OUT OF NO WHERE WOKE UP CRYING. BECAUSE SHE WAS COLD. UT SHE COULDN'T EXPRESS THAT. LATER SHE WOULD BECOME DIAGNOSED AS SEVERELY DEVELOPMENTALLY DELAYED NONVERBAL AND ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM IT WAS A LITTLE GIRL THAT HAD NOT ONE WORD IN HER VOCABULARY. THAT COULDN'T WAKE UP FROM THAT CAR AND SAY NOT APATHY A SISSY I'M COLDS. AFTER HER DIAGNOSIS IN HER IMMERSION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES THAT LITTLE GIRL WOULD COME TO TALK AND BE A CHATTERBOX WHO WE JOKE HAS NOT STOPPED TALKING. IT WAS THE MAYOR WATCHING A MIRACLE HAPPEN BEFORE OUR EYES AND THERE ARE SO MANY FAMILIES LIKE LIKE MINE THATNEED THAT EARLY DIAGNOSIS THAT NEED THE RESOURCES BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHILDREN IT'S A LIFETIME SPECTRUM DISORDER. STARDOLL NEED SERVICES OUR SENIORS WITH AUTISM NEED SERVICES AND WE HAVE THE POWER IN THIS BODY CHU DRESS THIS ISSUE TO BRING MORE SERVICES TO PEOPLE ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHETHER THAT S. SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE BALLOT ISSUE MAKE CLOSE.
