SO WHAT THIS THING THE CALIFORNIA. LICENSE THAT COLLECTS. DEBT BUYING INDUSTRY WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS HAD LAWS ON THE BOOKS REQUIRING FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVENS. ARE LAWS TO LITTLE TO STEM THE BAD BEHAVIOR- WHICH THIRD DESIGNED TO PROHIBIT. THIS IS BECAUSE THE LAW REQUIRES THE CONSUMER TO SUIT THE DEBT COLLECTION. COMPANY THE CONSUMER HAS A RIGHT TO SUE THE DEBT COLLECTION COMPANY BUT MOST CONSUMERS. HAVE THE MEANS TO BE THE ROCKS AND THE LOS. EVEN FOR THE FEW WHO COULD AFFORD AN ATTORNEY IT IS FINANCIALLY WORTH THE TIME. TO TAKE THAT TO BRING A LAWSUIT AGAINST A COLLECTION AGENCY WHO VIOLATED THEIR CONSUMER RIGHTS BY COLLECTING AGAINST THE WRONG PERSON ATTEMPTING TO COLLECT A DEBT ALREADY PAID OR INFLATING THE AMOUNT THAT MONEY OF MONEY OWED OR MISREPRESENTING THEMSELVES. SO CONSUMERS AT THE END OF THE DAY NEVER BOTHER TO SUE AND THEY JUST GIVE UP.

WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ON SOME FINAL MOMENTS AND WE EXPECT TO BEING IN A SUPPORTING THE SHINS VERY. THANK YOU. MODERATORS THAT CONCLUDE OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT VIA TELECONFERENCE. YES AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION CAN YOU Q. THOSE- ALL WHAT WE FIRST HAVE. BRUCE HERE IN COMMITTEE ROOM FORTY TWO ALL THREE PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME IN YOUR POSITION. CALIFORNIA OUR ASSOCIATION A STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION OF LAWYERS WHO- PREDOMINATELY DO DEBT COLLECTION- WORK ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS FIRST- AND WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND WE ARE ASKING FOR A NARROW EXEMPTION FROM THAT- BUILT. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY NOTING THAT LAWYER. COLLECT DEBT ROUTINELY SOMETIMES IT'S CONSUMER DEBT COVERED BY THIS BILL SOMETIMES THEY'LL BE ENGAGED TO COLLECT CHILD SUPPORT DELINQUENT CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS SOMETIMES IT'S A JUDGMENT THAT REMAINS UNPAID AND I'LL BE ENGAGED TO COLLECT ON THAT DEBT. COLLECTION OF DEBT BY LAWYER IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF LAW PRACTICE. NOW LAST YEAR SENATOR WE CASKEY HAD SB ONE EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH WE DIDN'T POSE WHICH CLARIFY THAT. ALTHOUGH LAW FIRMS HAD ALREADY BEEN SUBJECT TO THE ROSENTHAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT I WAS TOLD THAT THIS NARROWLY- CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE AND MADE SURE THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT LAWYERS ARE ALSO SUBJECT. TO THE ROSENTHAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT AND I WAS TOLD THAT IS NOT A STRETCH BECAUSE THE STATE ARE ACT ALL READY REQUIRES LAWYERS TO COMPLY WITH THE ROE AND FALL DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES THAT. TIME WOULD HAVE. OF BUT SEVEN SO POINT BUT I WILL SAY IN YOUR WELCOME TO LOOK AT A IT IS A FULL OF THING THAT WE SHALL DO AND SHE NOT TO IN COLLECTION OF DEATH BUT THE LAST SENTENCE IS A WILLFUL THIS SECTION CONSTITUTES BECAUSE FOR THE IMPOSITION OF DISCIPLINE OF THE ATTORNEY IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION SIX OH SEVEN SEVEN IN OTHER WORDS THE STATE BAR HAS FULL AUTHORITY TO DISCIPLINE LAWYERS FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE DEBT COLLECTION LAWS. THIS IN A SITUATION WHERE THE STATE BAR. WORK REGULATE SMOKERS EXCEPT FOR SOME LOOPHOLE THAT EXISTS THE STATE BAR REGULATES LAWYERS FULLY UNDER THIS SECTION FOR DEBT COLLECTION LAWS SO ALL I WOULD SAY IT WE'VE HAD CORDIAL AND PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH SENATOR WE CASKEY BUT EVERYONE IS HURTING NOW AND LAW FIRMS ARE HURTING LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. AND SO WE'RE JUST TO HAVING A SECOND LICENSE FOR MAY SECOND REGULATOR. REGULATE EXACTLY THE SAME ACTIVITY THAT OUR S ALREADY BEING REGULATED BY THE STATE BAR THIS IS DUPLICATIVE AND THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO SUBJECT LAW FIRMS OR ANYONE ELSE IN MY VIEW. TO DUPLICATE OF UNNECESSARY EGULATION WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY COVERED BY THE STATE BAR SO WITH THAT WE WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE IN LAST APPROPRIATE AMENDMENTS ARE ADOPTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MELANIE GRANT FOR THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION I WANTED TO KNOW THAT WE APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE WE HAD WITH THE AUTHOR AS WELL THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENT. I'M UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. FOR MEMBER BRING AND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ALSO NOTED IN THE EXEMPTION SOMETHING UNFORTUNATELY AT THAT TIME WE START MADE UP. LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR DIALOGUE THE- THREE. YOU NEED A DISH WITH ON LINING KEY. AND OPPOSITION MISTER MINER. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN THE QUEUE OKAY HEARING SEEN NINE I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE BUT BEFORE I DO SO I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT BETWEEN THE LAST HEARING IN THIS HEARING ALL THE COVERINGS ON THE MICROPHONES HAVE BEEN AND SO THOSE. EXPERT NOW THE CURRENT ROOM MICROPHONE PHONES. WERE CHANGED BETWEEN PARENT SO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. MAN OF ICE YEAR THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CENTER Y. CASKEY FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD ON I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE ONCEPT I KNOW FROM SPEAKING TO MAKE CONSTITUENTS ABOUT CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE WITH DEBT COLLECTION BUT I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE ASKING QUESTIONS OF. THE OPPOSITION WE HEARD MR BELOW WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CREDITORS SO FISHING THAT THERE ISN'T JUSTIFICATION FOR INCLUDING LAWYERS WERE ALREADY LICENSE IN THIS BILL SO WHAT THE COMPELLING REASON LOTS STIR OF WHAT IS GOING TO INCLUDE ATTORNEYS IN THIS PROPOSAL. FOLLOW AT SEVEN TWO FIRST THE PRACTICE OF LAW IS NOT TO PRACTICE OF DEBT COLLECTION AND I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE TO LICENSE SINCE WHAT STATE ARE. LOOK LICENSES AND REGULATES ATTORNEYS IN THE PRACTICE OF LAW IT IS NOT PRACTICE. IS NOT THE PRACTICE A DEBT COLLECTION THAT ACTIVITY OF DEBT COLLECTION IN- IS DIFFERENT POSSESSING LEGAL TRAINING MIGHT BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE BUSINESS OF THAT I THINK BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME ACTIVITY. TO THAT END LEGAL THANK WOULD BE AFFECT. SEVEN WHICH IS OF. INDUSTRIES YOU CAN. AND A ARCHITECTURE HE AID TO SPEND. BUT ALL. THERE'S LICENSE THEY HAVE CAJUN THAT BUSINESS THE STATE UP HAS PROPERLY THIS. BARK THIS THESE OF THESE LICENSES YOU CAN. BE UP. INTO THE GROUP. ACTIVE SHE'S. BEEN TO. BUT AND SAY I GET A PER EXAM SO WOULD BE THE YOU KNOW HERE'S MY PASS MY PER PASSED SOME OF IT I DON'T NEED TO PET GROOMING LICENSE SO THAT'S THE FIRST ONE EVEN IF THE EXTENSION EIGHT FOR THE PROFESSION ATTORNEYS ON FIRM PARTICULARLY. UNDESERVING OF THE LOOPHOLE AND LET ME IT WAS A BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEY WHO WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEBT COLLECTORS IN A LAW FIRM OPERATE TODAY COLLECTOR DEBT AS MILLS THEY SEND THOUSANDS OF LETTERS TO PEOPLE ON THE WALL LET HEAD AND THINK CASE THE CONCERT USING LAW FIRM'S NAME THERE'S A IN THAT THEY DO THIS MADAM VICE CHAIR SITS AFFECTED. IS CONCERNED TO KNOW LAW FIRM AND THEY PLEDGING THAT THEY OWN A TAD AND INTIMIDATED. THEY'RE FRIGHTENED. AND THE BIG THEIR- AND SAM IN WHAT HEAD AND THEY START MAKING. AND REITERATING SEND THE IT'S IN THE- I'M NOW. NINE AWAIT IS USING HIS USES THE EXISTING CIVIL CODE THE TO DETERMINE WHAT A DEBT COLLECTOR IS THE BILL APPLIES ONLY TO THE PERSON WHO IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS REGULARLY ON A PERSON'S OWN BEHALF FOR ON BEHALF OF OTHERS ENGAGE ISN'T THAT COLLECTION. THIS IS NOT DIDN'T THE- ATTORNEY WHO'S GOING AFTER DEBT ONE OF THEIR CLIENTS WHO HASN'T PAID THEIR BILL OR IS IT IS A DOING THIS ONE OFF THEIR SEEKING TO GET PAID- THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR OWN SERVICES THIS IS THIRD. THEIR PRACTICES. NO I'M A LAWYER- I. OPPOSE THE IDEA OF EXEMPTING LAWYERS FROM LICENSORS. I THINK THAT I'M GONNA LOSE MUCH OF MY SUPPORT FROM ALL THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HEARD OF AN INTERN COLLUDED IN THE- STATE THIRTIES ANALYSIS. THAT LEGAL SERVICE LAWYERS NO BETTER THAN ANYBODY- THE SERIOUS PROBLEM IN THIS SPACE OF DECK COLLECTING- IN SOME OF THOSE SUPPORT LETTERS THEY CAME AND WORKED SO WE'RE SAYING. EVEN WITH THE STE FEDERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION. AGENCY A MOUNTAIN MMHM. MOST OF THE- COMPLAINTS COME IN OUR UP THAT COLLECTING AND PEOPLE DON'T EVEN OVER THE DEAD. GETTING IN WRITING SO THIS IS AN OTHER PROTECTED. MAYBE IT LOOKS LIKE THE INCONVENIENCE FOR THE LAWYERS IN THIS SPACE BUT- REALLY NECESSARY FOR THE CONCERT. IT CAN ITHANK YOU SO MUCH CAN I CAN I HAVE MISTER BELOW ALSO ANSWER- TO INSTALL IF I MIGHT MISTER. SIR WE COUNTIES EFFECTIVE ORDER BUT RESPECTFULLY HIS ANALOGY DOESN'T STAND. HE WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU REPRESENT A CONTRACTOR- THAT'S FINE THIS IS TANTAMOUNT TO REQUIRING A CONTRACTOR'S LICENSE IF YOU REPRESENT A CONTRACT. THE CALIFORNIA CREDITORS BAR REPRESENTS CLIENTS WHO EITHER- HAVE EXTENDED CREDIT AND WEREN'T PAID. FOR WERE- BUT DEBT AND ARE THE LEGAL OWNER OF THE DEBT SO THEY ARE REPRESENTING A CLIENT EXACTLY AS A LAWYER REPRESENTING. THE CONTRACTOR IN HIS CASE OR A LAWYER REPRESENTING THE VETERINARIAN THEY ARE A CLIENT OF THE LAW FOR. AND SO THIS IS A TROLL TO THE PRACTICE OF LAW AND THERE ISN'T ANY. SPEAKING CENTER WORK SUGGEST THERE BEING SOMETHING WITH THE ROSENTHAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT SPEAKS TO COLLECTING DEBT. AND THE STATE BAR ACCESS THAT YOU CAN LOSE YOUR LICENSE IF YOU VIOLATE THE ROSENTHAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN BE DISBARRED. FOR FAILING TO COMPLY WITH ROSENTHAL AND SO THIS IS SIMPLY A DUPLICATE LICENSING SCHEME OF FOR THE SAME ACTIVITY. THE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES ARE MEETING ENTERS THE QUESTION FROM START AT NO THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. OF FOR RESPONSE SO I JUST WANT TO SAY. I SUPPORT THE BILL OVERALL BUT I REALLY DO REMAIN CONCERNED THAT WE'RE TESTING TO WIDE OF THE NET OVER THE COLLECTION MARKET- AS MENTIONED TO ATTORNEYS ARE LICENSED UNDER THE STATE PARTNER ARE TO MEET STANDARDS UNDER THAT LIKE IT'S AN AYE VOTE LOOK I VOTED FOR SB. ONE EIGHTY SEVEN DOES YOUR BILL LAST YEAR THE- WELL. DEBT COLLECTION PARK ACT AND- AND ATTORNEYS ARE REGULATED UNDER. YOUR BILL LAST YEAR BUT I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE MORE PRESCRIPTIVE WITH OUR REGULATIONS SO THERE ARE NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES- GIVEN THAT. I AM GOING TO LAY OFF TODAY AND I HOPE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS ISSUE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE I. PUT IT ON THE PHONE I'M REALLY HOPING THAT WE CAN WORK ON IT BECAUSE- YOU ARE RIGHT YOU KNOW DEBT COLLECTION SHOULD HAVE OVERSIGHT CALIFORNIANS. DESERVE A CONSUMER PROTECTION IN THE SPACE SO THANK YOU BRING THE BEFORE. THANK YOU CENTER GLORIA. WELL I WON'T I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT BUT I FEEL PRETTY MUCH THE SAME WAY IT I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION TO ME JUST SAY THAT I LIKE THE BILL I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO- REGULATE A DEBT COLLECTION. BUT BUT IN IN THE DISTANCE OF ATTORNEYS IN PARTICULAR- THEY- SENDING OUT A LETTER CAN BE INTIMIDATING AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IT'S ALSO WITH. THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE OF WHAT APPROPRIATE IN TERMS OF. OF DEBT COLLECTION IF YOU SAID THAT THEY WERE USING. PRACTICES THAT- IS THAT I'VE I'VE HEARD. ARE USED THEN I MIGHT FEEL A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY ABOUT IT BUT I JUST DON'T SEE ANY NEED FOR A- SECOND REGULATORY ORGANIZATION. THE FACT THAT YOU CAN LOSE YOUR LICENSE I TO BE. I TO BE- SCARY ENOUGH AND FRANKLY. IF THE STATE BAR IS IN DOING THEIR JOB THEN I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE STATE BAR AND I THINK WE DO NEED SOMETHING ABOUT THE STATE BAR BUT UP BUT NOT IN THIS BILL SO I WILL SUPPORT A BUT I. TO CONSIDER AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD THAT WOULD TAKE ATTORNEYS OUT OF THAT BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE WAITED ON PROCRIT LATE- UNDER PRIOR BILLS AND THE STATE BAR. ANY THIS QUESTION FOR MEMBERS SHE NINE CENTER Y. COSCO TALKED RESPONSE YEAH I BIRDS I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE C. AC AND BARI ARE M. A. R. THIRD LISTED IN THE- BUT THEY ARE NOT CONTINUE TO THEM RIGHT NOW I'M JUST NOT IN A POSITION TO GIVE THEM EVERYTHING THEY- BECAUSE OF.
