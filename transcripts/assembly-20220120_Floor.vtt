JOURNEY TO BECOME A MOTHER HAVE

00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:29.019
NEVER QUESTIONS WHETHER I WOULD

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:31.522
MAKE THIS A DECISION ABOUT WHEN

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:34.191
AND IF I WOULD GET A REMAIN

00:46:34.258 --> 00:46:36.760
PREGNANT. I ALWAYS DREAMT OF

BEING A MOTHER. BUT MY JOURNEY

00:46:38.095 --> 00:46:39.396
TO MOTHERHOOD LIKE MANY WASN'T

00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:41.865

00:46:44.434 --> 00:46:45.936
PRIVILEGE WOMAN WITH AMAZING

00:46:46.003 --> 00:46:48.472

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:50.174
ALONG EVERY STEP OF THE JOURNEY

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.075
INSURED I KNEW IT WAS MY CHOICE

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:54.044
WHAT WE WOULD DO. THAT SHE WOULD

00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:55.779
BE THERE FOR ME AND THAT WE

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:57.147
WOULD MAKE THAT DECISION

00:46:57.214 --> 00:46:59.816
TOGETHER AND ALONE. AND I AM

00:46:59.883 --> 00:47:01.084
BLESSED NOW WITH THREE BEAUTIFUL

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:03.453

WITH THE ECONOMY TO MAKE THAT

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:08.625

00:47:08.692 --> 00:47:10.994
LOOK IN MY DAUGHTER'S EYES. AND

00:47:11.061 --> 00:47:13.497
I THINK ABOUT WHETHER SHE WILL

00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:15.766
HAVE THAT SAME RIGHT TO DECIDE

00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:18.969
HER OWN FUTURE MAY DEPEND ON

00:47:19.036 --> 00:47:21.738
WHERE SHE LIVES SOME DAY. IT

00:47:21.805 --> 00:47:25.042

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:42.205
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY

00:50:42.272 --> 00:50:44.775
RESTRICTIONS ON THAT CARE. FOUR

00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:46.009
IF I HADN'T GONE TO COLLEGE I

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:47.377
WOULD HAVE HAD ACCESS TO ANY

00:50:47.444 --> 00:50:49.780
LIKE HER ON EITHER OR THAT WE

00:50:49.846 --> 00:50:50.614
CONTROL THAT ALLOWED ME TO

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.149
CONTINUE MY STUDIES THIS IS A

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:53.383
REALITY FOR A LOT OF THE PEOPLE

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:55.452
BACK HOME FOR ME. FOR MANY THE

00:50:55.519 --> 00:50:57.120
LACK OF ACCESS COULD BE DUE TO

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:58.555
SOCIAL STRUCTURAL FACTORS SUCH

00:50:58.622 --> 00:50:59.589
AS FEWER NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH.

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:00.657
SERVICES LESS INSURANCE COVERAGE

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:02.259
INCREASED ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL

00:51:02.325 --> 00:51:04.027
AND ECONOMIC ATTAINMENT. EVEN

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:06.797
PRACTICED ON OVER FACTORS SUCH

00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:08.732
AS RACIAL BIAS AND STEREOTYPING

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:10.600
. THE FIGHT IS NOT JUST ABOUT A

00:51:10.667 --> 00:51:11.535
PERSON'S RIGHT TO CONTROL THEIR

00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:12.803
OWN DESTINY WHATEVER INSURING

00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:13.870

00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:15.839
COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS IT'S

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:18.708
ABOUT EQUITY. THE REALITY IS

00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:20.076
THAT IN THOSE STATES WHERE THIS

00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:21.812
IS BEING CHALLENGED AND PROBABLY

00:51:21.878 --> 00:51:22.446
GOING TO BE OVERTURNED. IF YOU

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:24.114
HAVE THE MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO

00:51:24.181 --> 00:51:25.248
FIND THE HEALTH CARE THAT YOU

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:26.950
NEED IT'S EVERYONE ELSE THAT'S

00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:28.885
GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND

00:51:28.952 --> 00:51:29.953
COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE THAT ARE

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.054
GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND. H. R.

CELEBRATION. CELEBRATING THE

THEIR OWN REPRODUCTIVE DECISION

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.902
. FORTY NINE YEARS AGO WE AFFIRM

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:22.272
THAT THE DECISION TO CONTINUE OR

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:24.007
NOT CONTINUE A PREGNANCY IS

00:52:24.074 --> 00:52:27.444
SACRED. PERSONAL AND SHOULD NOT

00:52:27.511 --> 00:52:29.813
BE MADE FOR A WOMAN BY LAWYERS

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.716
NOR POLITICIANS. FORTY NINE

00:52:32.782 --> 00:52:34.751
YEARS AGO WE AFFIRMED THAT

00:52:34.818 --> 00:52:37.821
REGARDLESS OF YOUR RACE OR SOCIO

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:39.789
ECONOMIC STATUS THAT ALL WOMEN

00:52:39.856 --> 00:52:41.691
SHOULD HAVE ACCESS THE SAME

00:52:41.758 --> 00:52:43.293
ACCESS AND OPTIONS FOR THE

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.996
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. BUT

00:52:46.062 --> 00:52:47.264
UNFORTUNATELY THE

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:49.533
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND CELEBRATION

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:51.167
OF THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS BE

00:52:51.234 --> 00:52:53.703
MADE FORTY NINE YEARS AGO. IS

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:55.839
BEING OVERSHADOWED BY THE VERY

00:52:55.906 --> 00:52:57.607
REAL AND SERIOUS THREAT OF IT

00:52:57.674 --> 00:52:59.509
BEING OVERTURNED BY THE SUPREME

00:52:59.576 --> 00:53:03.046
COURT. LEAVING AT LEAST THIRTY

00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:05.315
SIX MILLION WOMEN NEARLY HALF

00:53:05.382 --> 00:53:07.417
WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE IN THE

00:53:07.484 --> 00:53:10.120
UNITED STATES. ACROSS TWENTY SIX

00:53:10.186 --> 00:53:12.322
STATES. WITHOUT ACCESS TO

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:18.361
ABORTION. AS AN OBGYN I HAVE

00:53:18.428 --> 00:53:19.996
COUNSELED AND MANAGED MANY

00:53:20.063 --> 00:53:23.099
PATIENTS WITH INTENDED AND

00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:26.002
UNINTENDED PREGNANCIES. THOSE

00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:28.471
WHO DESIRE TO CONTINUE WITH THE

00:53:28.538 --> 00:53:30.840
PREGNANCY AND THOSE WHO DESIRE

00:53:30.907 --> 00:53:33.076
TO TERMINATE THEIR PREGNANCY.

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:35.045
AND I CAN TELL YOU. THESE

00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:37.013
DECISIONS ARE NEVER EASY FOR ANY

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:40.750
WOMAN. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT

00:53:40.817 --> 00:53:44.821
IT IS HER BODY AND HER CHOICE.

00:53:44.888 --> 00:53:46.389
BEFORE I MOVED BACK TO THIS

00:53:46.456 --> 00:53:48.258
GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WAS

00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:51.695
ACTUALLY PRACTICING IN TEXAS.

00:53:51.761 --> 00:53:53.797
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I LEFT IS

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:54.898
BECAUSE AS A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:57.367
PHYSICIAN AND A WOMAN. WHOSE

00:53:57.434 --> 00:53:59.235
HARD TO PRACTICE IN THE STATE.

00:53:59.302 --> 00:54:00.403
THAT DID NOT RESPECT OUR

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:02.038
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND WAS

00:54:02.105 --> 00:54:03.740
CONSTANTLY SWIPING STRIPPING

00:54:03.807 --> 00:54:06.610
AWAY OUR ACCESS AND OUR POWER

00:54:06.676 --> 00:54:09.879
OUR OWN BODIES. WE ARE LOOKING

00:54:09.946 --> 00:54:12.182
IN CALIFORNIA THAT DESPITE WHAT

00:54:12.248 --> 00:54:13.984
THE SUPREME COURT MAY DO WE WILL

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:15.485
STAY STEADFAST TO THE

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:17.921
AFFIRMATIONS WE MADE AS A

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:19.656
COUNTRY FORTY NINE YEARS AGO.

00:54:19.723 --> 00:54:21.491
BUT WE MUST NOT FORGET ABOUT

00:54:21.558 --> 00:54:23.727
THOSE WOMEN WHO LIVE IN THE

00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:25.095
TWENTY SIX STATES THAT MAY SOON

00:54:25.161 --> 00:54:27.197
LOSE THEIR RIGHTS TO EASILY

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:31.368
ACCESS SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION.

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:32.969

GREW UP IN A TIME WHEN. I

00:56:57.914 --> 00:56:58.948
THOUGHT THIS DECISION HAD BEEN

00:56:59.015 --> 00:57:00.850
MADE FOR US. MY MOTHER AND MY

ENSURE. THAT I HAD THE ABILITY

00:57:06.089 --> 00:57:08.191
TO MAKE THESE CHOICES FOR MYSELF
