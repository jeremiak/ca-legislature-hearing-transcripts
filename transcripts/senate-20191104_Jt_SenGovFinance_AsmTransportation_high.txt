APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU BEING HERE TODAY WILL CONVENE HERE IN ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS. THANK YOU. TESTING GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO THIS JOINT HEARING OF THE SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE GENTLEMAN TO MY RIGHT. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL TO BE A PARTNER WITH CHAIRMAN FRAZIER FROM THE ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE ON THIS. IMPORTANT ISSUE OF SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES I WANT TAKE MOMENT SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR HIS COMEDIAN AMAZING COMMITTEE TEAM FOR ALL THE WORK THAT WENT INTO TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU THE GENTLEMAN TO MY LEFT- ANTON FROM GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE FOR ALL THE WORK THAT WENT INTO THE PREPARATION FOR TODAY'S HEARING THANK YOU SO MUCH AND TIME. WE'RE ALSO HONORED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE HERE TODAY THAT SENATOR BAIL- IN THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER SENATOR FOR BEING HERE TODAY. TODAY'S HEARING STAYING IN THEIR LANE HOW SHOULD THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REGULATE NEW MOBILITY OPTIONS IN ASSURING ECONOMY. WILL BE FOCUS IT'S GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON THE POTENTIAL LOCAL AND STATE REGULATIONS ASSOCIATE WITH THE BIKES SCOOTERS AND OTHER DEVICES. WE WANTED HAVE A SERIES OF HEARINGS PRIOR TO LEGISLATION BEING ADVANCE WHICH WILL THEN ALLOW THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REALLY TO DO ITS DUE DILIGENCE. AND TAKE A DATA DRIVEN APPROACH TO THIS ISSUE RATHER THAN A ONE BILL AT A TIME STRATEGY. A CANDIDLY WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK. IN THE SHORT TIME THAT DID THEY HAVE BEEN ON OUR STREETS AND ROADS SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES SUCH AS THE SCOOTERS AND BIKES. HAVE SOARED IN POPULARITY. NOT SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF RIDESHARING SERVICES SUCH AS UBER AND LEFT HAVE WE SEEN SUCH A NEW MODE OF TRANSPORTATION BECOME SO WIDELY ADOPTED IN SUCH A SHORT. PERIOD OF TIME. IF DONE RIGHT SCOOTER AND BOUGHT YOUR PROGRAM. HELP CALIFORNIA ADDRESS MANY OF OUR TRANSPORTATION CHALLENGES INCLUDING REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND- GETTING MORE PEOPLE AND OTHER FORMS OF MASS TRANSIT IN. URGING MORE ACTIVE FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION. HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW THAT THESE DEVICES COME WITH SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. PARTICULARLY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES REGULATING THIS FLEDGLING INDUSTRY. BUILDING EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS FROM RESIDENTS THAT FIND THEMSELVES DODGING SCOOTERS- TRYING TO AVOID INJURY OUR EYES SIDEWALK THAT IS BLOCKED. ENSURING THAT HE BIKES AND SCOOTERS ARE DEPLOYED EVENLY ACROSS THE CITY. IS ANOTHER ISSUE ENSURING THAT EQUAL ACCESS FOR ALL NEIGHBORHOODS AS A PRIORITY. IT'S A MAJOR CONCERN FOR MANY MUNICIPALITIES AS WELL. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE TASKED WITH MAKING SURE THAT ALL TRANSPORTATION YOU USERS. PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS SCOOTERS AND OTHERS CAN SIMPLY USE THE PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY. BASED ON LOCAL NEEDS IN CIRCUMSTANCES. WE'VE CONVENE THIS JOINT HEARING. TO UNDERSTAND THE NUANCES OF REGULATING THE SHARED MICRO ABILITY INDUSTRY. INTO A FORM THE LEGISLATURE'S WE CONSIDER WHERE STATE STANDARDS. OR REQUIREMENTS ARE OR ARE NOT NEEDED. EIGHT FULL THAT WE HAVE ONE OF THE AUTHORS AND I KNOW THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER TO CHEESE ON HIS WAY- THE LARGEST SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE BILLS HERE WITH US TODAY WE'RE HONORED THAT IS IN THE WOMAN FRIEDMAN IS JOINING US WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR WORK. AND YOUR PARTNERSHIP AS WELL WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY. WE'RE FIRST GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATE'S LAST EXPERIMENT A MOBILITY CHANGES TRANSPORTATION NETWORK. COMPANIES AND TO SEE WHERE AND WHAT WE CAN APPLY FROM THAT EXPERIENCE A SHARED SCOOTERS AND BIKES. WE WILL THEN HEAR FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE SCOOTER INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER ADVOCATES ON THE CHALLENGES. THEY ALL FACES THEY CONTEND WITH REGULATION OF THESE NEW TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES. AGAIN TODAY'S HEARING IS FOCUS ON THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCAL AND STATEWIDE REGULATION. A SECONDARY HEARING WILL HAPPEN AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR ON DATA SHARING THAT'S THE OTHER. BIG ISSUE THAT HAS RISEN FROM THE INDUSTRY. NOW I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO OUR PARTNER HE'S STILL A MEMBER FROM DISAGREED PAY FOR HIS INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MCGUIRE IS A WILL MOVE ON TO SMARTPHONES HAVE REVEL IN IT REVOLUTIONIZED THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. BELOW IS TO HILL SOMEONE DRIVING THEIR PERSONAL VEHICLES TO CATCH A RIDE. THEY HAVE ENABLE COMPANIES TO RENTAL BICYCLES AND SCOOTERS WITHOUT A TACORI STORE. ALLOW FREE EASY ACCESS TO NAVIGATION OUR IN OUR CARS. AND ONE DAY THEY WILL ALLOW US TO HAIL A DRIVERLESS VEHICLES TO PICK US UP. THE WORLD OF TRANSPORTATION IS RAPIDLY CHANGING. AND GOVERNMENT HAS STRUGGLED TO KEEP UP WITH THESE. AND HOW TO RE REGULATE THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN JOLTING FOR SOME AND SO MANY. SOME HAVE USED SCOOTERS AS A GREAT FIRST AND LAST MILE SOLUTION FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT A FUN WAY TO TOUR A NEW CITY OR EVEN SOMETHING TO EXPAND OUR LUNCH OPTIONS DURING WORK HOURS. FOR OTHERS THE SCOOTERS HAVE BEEN IT BLIGHT. THE BLOCK SIDEWALKS BACK IN THE BLACK ACCESS FOR THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. TAKE WAY PARKING SPOTS FOR CARS AND BIKES AND MAKE OUR SIDE WITH LOOK LIKE A CLUTTERED MESS. DESPITE IT BEING ILLEGAL TO RIDE SCOOTERS ON A SIDEWALK WRITERS OFTEN MISUSE THEM AND MAKE PEDESTRIANS FEEL LESS SAFE BY ZOOMING PAST THEM GOING TEN MILES PER HOUR. THE INCLUDED BY CLEANS ON OUR BEACHES TAKING AWAY THE ENJOYMENT OF A LEISURELY BIKE RIDE. BECAUSE THESE DEVICES USE OUR PUBLIC STREETS INSTEAD OF A BRICK AND MORTAR STORE OR A DOG. THEY OFTEN HAVE TO RELY ON CHEAP LABOR TO PICK THEM UP. AND TO CHARGE THEM. SOME HERALD THESE DEVICES A REPLACEMENT FOR CARS. OTHERS HAVE QUESTIONED HOW A DEVICE THAT NEEDS TO BE CHARGED EVERY FIFTEEN MILES CAN TRULY REPLACE CAR TRIPS. ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT WERE POWER OUTAGES ARE STARTING TO FEEL LIKE THE NEW NORMAL. TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING TODAY YOU HAVE TO FIND A BIKE OR SCOOTER TO RIDE ONE. IN A FEW YEARS AN AUTOMATED BIKE OR SCOOTER MAY COME TO YOU. AS THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES CONTINUE TO EMERGE THERE WILL BE A RUSH OF LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY WILL POSE. COMPANIES WHO FEAR REGULATION WOULD OFTEN PREFER TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE THE PUT THE STATE OVER EACH OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE HUNDREDS. AND HUNDREDS OF CITIES. BUT SOMETIMES ARE LOCALS ARE BETTER EQUIPPED TO REGULATE BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY ONES THAT HEAVILY RELY ON PUBLIC SPACE TOP. THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING TODAY IS TO TAKE A DEE BREATH AND CONSIDER WHAT OUR ROLE AS MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE IN DEVELOPING COMPLY JUST LISTEN TO ADDRESS THESE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. THIS pOPPORTUNITY HERE FROM THE CITIES ON THE GROUND HAVE ALREADY TAKEN COMPREHENSIVE STEPS TO REGULATE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES. WE WILL HAVE WE WILL ALSO HEAR FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS THE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATING SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS BRAVE NEW WORLD OF TRANSPORTATION POLICY. WITH THAT SENATOR. WITH A TEAM THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE PARTNERSHIP- WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF THE CHAIR FROM. SENATE TRANSPORTATION WOULD LIKE TO SAY IN THE OPENING WORDS OR ANY MEMBERS INCLUDING SOMEONE FRIEDMAN. WHO IS ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE BIG BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN MOVING. ANY OPENING COMMENTS PLEASE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK TO GET EVERYONE TOGETHER TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS HE WOULD CITIES ARE DOING IN HERE FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS DIRECTLY ALL TO SAY THAT I REPRESENT PARTS OF LOS ANGELES- IT'S AN AREA THAT IS DEALING WITH TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO GET PEOPLE ON TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN A DEAL WITH THE GROWING POPULATION YOU KNOW WHEN A WITH THE REALIZATION THAT WE ALL CAN'T BE DRIVING CARS EVERYWHERE WE NEVER. HAVE ANY SPACE TO GET ANYWHERE AND WE SEE WHAT. OUR CULTURE HAS DONE TO LAND USE- AND TO GROWTH IN OUR- COMMUNITY AND TO OUR QUALITY OF LIFE IN OUR HEALTH. MY GOAL IS TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO ALLOW CITIES TO CONTINUE TO PLAN TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF CARS. TO GET PEOPLE ON THE TRANSIT. OF SCOOTERS AND OTHER MICHAEL MOBILITY HAVE A GREAT. OPPORTUNITY TO HELP WITH THE FIRST MILE LAST MILE PROBLEM- BUT WE ALSO SEE THIS HUGE BACKLASH- TO THEM- YOU KNOW I'LL BE. HONEST I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE UTILIZE THESE FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION AND FIND A WAY TO INTEGRATE THEM- QUICKLY AND SAFELY INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT WAS THE GOAL OF MY LEGISLATION- AND. LOOKING FOR THE CONVERSATION TODAY SO THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH THE MOMENT SOMEONE WELCOME. WANT TO SEE IF YOU IS THE TWO OF YOU BEEN FOR THE FOCUSING IN IN THIS SPACE TWO DIFFERENT SUBJECTS RELATED TO THE SHURE MOBILITY DEVICE MARKET. MR SALOON YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER ANY OPENING REMARKS YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER SHERMAN AND MR SHERMAN FOR THIS HEARING I. I BELIEVE A WORD. YOU KNOW- BASICALLY ON THE SAME PAGE AND THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT- WHILE THERE. IS GOOD REASON OTHER SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES CAN BE FUND AFFORDABLE. AND ECO FRIENDLY WAYS TO GET AROUND- LIKE ANY NEW INNOVATION E NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SAFE- BOTH FOR USERS AND FOR PEDESTRIANS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. WITH BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. THAT'S WHY I INTRODUCED ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE EIGHTY SIX. TO PROTECT CONSUMERS OF THESE SERVICES AS WELL AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC. BY REQUIRING CITIES AND COUNTIES TO DOT BASIC SAFETY RULES. AS WELL AS PROVIDING FOR CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT WOULD PROTECT USERS. AND THIRD PARTIES IN AND BACK EVENT OF AN INJURY- IF I. RECOGNIZE SO MISTER CHAIRMAN I HEARD YOU- AS IT WAS COMING OVER HERE ABOUT THE NEED TO HAVE- THE BIG PICTURE IN MIND AND SO I LOOK FOR IN THE CONVERSATION TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND- BEFORE I TURN OVER TO THE CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO BE TO WORK WITH YOU TO THE COMMITTEES- IN TAKING A BIG PICTURE LOOK AT THIS- AND HOLISTIC LOOK. AT THIS ARE MERGING ISSUE THROUGHOUT THE STATE- BOTH HERE IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS EMERGING ISSUE THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTRY AS WELL. SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO IF- ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SAY IN THE OPENING REMARKS. I DO ON A WALK IN THE VICE CHAIR FROM GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE CENTER MORE LUCK WITH YOUR TO DO THINK SO MUCH HERS GOOD TO SEE YOU. WITHOUT FURTHER DO ALTERNATE OVER THE CHAIR TO INTRODUCE OUR FIRST PANEL. SIR FIRST PANELS- BLOOM TO THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF UCLA INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDES WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR COMING ALL THIS WAY OF HIS HEARING. WHEN YOU'RE PREPARED PLEASE STRUCTURE PRESENTATION. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER CHAIRMAN- MY NAME IS ONE WAY TO TâM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE UCLA INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES TODAY TO INTRODUCED THIS TOPIC I'LL BE SPEAKING ABOUT- WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES AND TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES AND AS IMPORTANTLY WHEN WE KNEW IT- WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING TO REGULATE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES AND WHAT CALIFORNIA CITIES ARE DOING TO REGULATE SHARED MOBILITY FIVE DEVICES. SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES ANTEON SEES WELL I WOULD SAY THAT WE KNOW MORE ABOUT SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES SOONER IN THEIR EVOLUTION THAN WE DID FOURTEEN AND SEES BECAUSE OF HOW THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE AFFECTS DATA COLLECTION AND DATA SHARING. SO RIGHT NOW CITIES REQUIRE PUBLIC RELEASE OF DEVICE POSITION DATA OF AND PRIVATE SHARING OF OPERATIONAL DATA- SHOULD MOBILITY PROVIDERS ALSO SHARE- PUBLIC THE- DEVICE POSITION DATA AS A- MARKETING TOOL TO SHOW THEIR CONSUMERS WHERE THESE DEVICES MIGHT BE. AND CITIES ARE ALSO REQUIRING SHARED MOBILITY PROVIDERS TO- FIELD SURVEYS AND TO PROVIDE THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY IS TO THE CITIES. IN CONTRAST TNC IS WERE NOT REQUIRED TO RELEASE DATA PUBLICLY AND I'VE ONLY SHARE DATA PRIVATELY WITH THE CPUC AND AIRPORTS IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT- WHAT THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY KNEW ABOUT TNC LAGS EFFICIENTLY WHAT THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY NOW KNOWS ABOUT SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES. SO THE FIRST STUDY THAT ACTUALLY USE DATA ON TMZ'S WAS A TWENTY FIFTEEN CONFERENCE PAPER SO THAT'S THREE YEARS AFTER THE LAUNCH IN SAN FRANCISCO. OF UBER ACCENT AND THE LIVE SERVICE AND WHAT THEY DID IS THEY CREATED FORTY THREE COPIES OF THE UBER APP TO COLLECT DATA BECAUSE IT WASN'T SURE IT WASN'T PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. AND EVEN THAT STUDY ONLY PROVIDED INSIGHT INTO CONGESTION PRICING ALGORITHMS. OR SEARCH PRICING ALGORITHMS RATHER AND THAT PAPER WAS IN PEER REVIEWED YOU HAVE TO GO FORTY EIGHT PLUS MONTHS AFTER THESE SERVICES LAUNCH THE TNC SERVICES LUNCH TO HAVE THE FIRST REVIEWED PAPER- THAT WAS INDEPENDENT. AND THEN ANALYTICAL- AND THAT WAS BASED ON- THE WORK OF AN EARLY BRAZIL AND DAVID KIRK AND IT BASICALLY LOOKED AT. NOT OVER DATA NOT LIFTED UP BUTTON IT SAID TRAFFIC FATALITY DATA AND LOOKED AT THE INTRODUCTION OF UBER INTO A MARKET PLACE. AND SEE IF THAT AFFECTED TRAFFIC FATALITIES AT ALL AND THEY FOUND IT DIDN'T SO FOUR YEARS AFTER. THAT STUDY WAS THE FIRST FOUR YEARS AFTER THE LAUNCH WAS THE FIRST REVIEWED STUDY. FURTHER MORE AT THE FIRST- CITY STUDY OR CITY COUNTY STUDY IN THIS CASE WAS BY THE SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY TO TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF. THESE VEHICLES IN THEIR DISTRICT AND THAT WAS FIVE YEARS AFTER THEIR LAUNCH- SO IN CONTRAST WE KNOW A LOT TWENTY SIX MONTHS AFTER. THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE DEVICES INTO- THE. CITY OF SANTA MONICA AND OTHER LOCATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT HIS INJURIES- SO THERE HAVE BEEN THREE MAJOR STUDIES OF INJURIES- THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN THE PAST YEAR. WHEN IT UCLA- ONE IN PORTLAND AND ANOTHER IN AUSTIN AND ALL OF THE STUDIES USED ITS DATA COLLECTED IN EMERGENCY ROOMS TO DESCRIBE INJURIES TO SCOOTER USERS. BY THE MOST COMMON INJURIES WERE TO THE UPPER EXTREMITIES SO THE LIMBS- ARMS BROKEN ARMS.ABOUT 15% OF INJURIES. THAT WERE REPORTED RESULTED IN A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. THAT'S PARTIALLY BECAUSE HELMET USE WAS REPORTED TO BE UNDER 10% FOR THE INJURED PARTIES. 8290% OF INCIDENTS DEPENDING ON THE STUDY AREA WERE SINGLE PARTY INCIDENTS MEANING THEY DIDN'T INVOLVE ANOTHER PERSON OR VEHICLE. SOME USERS IN THOSE STUDIES WERE INTOXICATED- 5% IN LA 16% IMPORTANT PORTLAND AUSTIN ACTUALLY FOLLOWED UP WITH PEOPLE WHO HAD CRASHED AND REPORTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOMS AND FOUND THAT 50% OF INJURED PARTIES BELIEVE THAT ROADWAY CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR CRASH OR THE SEVERITY OF THEIR INJURIES AND- FOUND THAT THIRTY PER 3% OF THOSE WHO WERE INJURED WERE INJURED DRING THEIR FIRST RIDE- AND 63% OF THOSE REPORTING INJURIES- HAD WRITTEN FEWER THAN NINE TIME SUGGESTING THAT RATES COULD GO DOWN OVER TIME. SO WHAT ARE THOSE RATES AND HOW DO THEY COMPARE WITH OTHER MODES OF TRANSPORTATION- THE AUSTIN IN PORTLAND STUDIES ESTIMATE RATES INJURIES OF TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE INJURIES THAT REPORT TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM PER HUNDRED THOUSAND TRIPS- THE AUSTIN STUDY NOTED THAT THIS WASN'T A CAUSE FOR ALARM ALTHOUGH IT'S HARD TO COMPARE THIS WITH OTHER MODES OF TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE WE JUST HAVE DATA ON INJURIES WERE SOMEBODY REPORTED TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM SO AS MORE STUDY. HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE WE EXPECT MARK. INFORMATION ON THAT SAN FRANCISCO REPORTED SIXTEEN COLLISIONS PER HUNDRED THOUSAND A SKIP TRIPS. SO IN GENERAL TO SIR MY- SUMMARIZE THE INJURY DATA IT WOULD SEEM THAT THERE'S- POTENTIALLY HIGHER RISK AT NIGHT AND HIGHER RISK WHEN IF SOMEBODY'S FIRST FEW TIMES ON A SCOOTER- LOOK AT UNC AND- UNVERIFIED BUT INDEPENDENTLY COLLECTED DATA BY AN INDUSTRY ANALYSTS. SUGGEST THAT- ABOUT- TWENTY SIX OF FORTY FOR COUNTIES TRACKED OCCURRED AT NIGHT. SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES AND TRAVEL BEHAVIOR. A LOT OF WHAT WE KNOW COMES FROM THE CITY SURVEYS THAT ARE LAUNCHED AS A CONDITION OF THE PERMITTING PROCESS. SO IN SAN FRANCISCO 70% OF TRIPS WERE UNDER TWO MILES. OF 41% OF SCOOTER USERS OR MOBILITY DEVICE USERS WOULD HAVE USED CAR FOR THEIR MOST RECENT TRIP. HAVE USE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND 34% ACTUALLY USE THE DEVICE TO GET TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION MUNIR PART. IN THIS CASE- SAN FRANCISCO SANTA MONICA FOUND HIGHER RATES OF DIVERSION FROM CARS ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT- BUT ALSO ONLY THAT 4% OF USERS SURVEYED WERE GOING TO AND FROM TRANSIT SO THE RESULTS FOR THE LAST MILE. THAT MIGHT VARY BASED ON LOCAL CONTEXT- PORTLAND SOUND FOUND SIMILAR FIGURES ONLY 6% USING THE- DEVICES TO GET TO FROM TRANSIT. SO IT SEEMS THAT THE AUTO TRIPS THAT THESE SERVICES ARE PRIMARILY DISPLACING ARE THEY TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANY- TYPE TRIPS AND THAT WAS THE CASE IN SAN FRANCISCO SANTA MONICA. AND PORTLAND. THE END THAT DIVERSION FROM CAR TRIPS IS IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS SO THERE WAS A PEER REVIEWED STUDY EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT LOOKED AT- THE GREENHOUSE GASES FROM THE MANUFACTURE OF THESE FACES TRANSPORTATION ACROSS THE- PACIFIC- DEPLOYMENT MAINTENANCE ETCETERA. AND FOUND THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST FOCUS ON THE- THE MILE TRAVELED YOU KNOW THE ZERO EMISSION MILE TRAVELED BUT ACTUALLY CLOSE 290% OF THE EMISSIONS. WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE DEVICES AND THE RELATIVELY SHORT LIFESPAN. AND THE REBALANCING ACTIVITY THAT TAKES PLACE- WITH THESE DEVICES AND SO THE EMISSIONS FROM RE BALANCING CAN DEFERRED PENDING ON THE OPERATING MODEL EMPLOYED SOME EMPLOYEE A GIG BASS PIECEMEAL MODEL IN SUMMER MORE CENTRALIZED AND MORE EFFICIENT IN TERMS OF THE MODEL THAT THE COMPANY USES TO COLLECT SCOOTERS. THE RESEARCHERS AT SAN JOSE SOME- STATES MINETA INSTITUTE DID A STUDY AND FOUND THAT 90% OF SCOOTER SAMPLED IN SAN JOSE. DIDN'T DISRUPT PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC COURSE THAT MEANS THAT 10% DID. SO WHAT ARE OTHER STATES DOING WELL ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATURES BUT TWENTY TWO STATES HAVE ENACTED STATUTES ADDRESSING SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE BUSINESS MODELS FOR DEVICE TYPES. CALIFORNIA INCLUDED LAST YEAR FLORES AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY NINE. SO WHAT THIS LEGISLATION IS DOING AS PRIMARILY SETTING INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS PER FOR PROVIDERS SETTING THE RULES OF THE ROAD FOR OPERATORS FOR EXAMPLE USE A BICYCLE LANE WHEN PRESIDENT YIELD TO PEDESTRIANS. CALIFORNIA AND OREGON ARE THE ONLY TWO STATES THAT RECALL- PROHIBIT THESE USERS FROM USING THE SIDEWALK. SETTING DEVICE REQUIREMENTS SOME OF THIS LEGISLATION SETS MAXIMUM STATEWIDE SPEED OR SPECIFICATION FOR THE SAFETY FEATURES. CALIFORNIA IS ALSO THE ONLY STATE TO REQUIRE A DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR THEIR OPERATION. SOME OF THESE BILLS ESTABLISH AUTHORITY FOR LOCALS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ASSESS FINES AND PENALTIES ON SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE CENTER OPERATORS. SEVEN OF THE TWENTY TWO STATES EXPRESSLY ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROHIBIT THE OPERATIONS OF THESE AND FIVE OF THE TWENTY TWO. STRICT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM APPLYING ANY MORE RESTRICTIVE- REGULATION ON THE IS THAT HOW THEY WOULD REGULATE BICYCLES. SOME OF THIS LEGISLATION DOES DEAL WITH THE SHARING OF DATA WITH LOCAL REGULATORS THREE STATES AUTHORIZED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REQUIRE SCOOTER DATA SHARING INCLUDING RIGHT ACTIVITY DATA THAT'S- IS ON A NEVADA AND UTAH. AND THESE LAWS OFTEN SET PARAMETERS FOR HOW THE LOCAL AUTHORITY USES THE DATA WHETHER OR NOT IT SUBJECT TO PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST AND THE DATA SECURITY FOR PUBLICLY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT ANY STATE PROHIBITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM REQUIRING ABILITY DATA SHARING. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CITY SO- THIS IS BEEN A BIT OF A STUDY IN CONTRASTS- BECAUSE OF TNC IS WITH THE STATE PREEMPTION- THERE WAS A UNIFORM STATEWIDE APPROACH TO TNC INTEGRATION- WITH SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES IT'S A REALLY A CASE OF- AND THE WORDS OF- LOUIS BRANDEIS LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY EXPERIMENTATION WITH DIFFERENT MODELS. SO AS EVIDENCE OF THESE CONTRAST SOME CALIFORNIA CITIES PROHIBITS YOUR MOBILITY DEVICES WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS SO THESE INCLUDE BEVERLY HILLS GOAL LEADER. IN THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ. OTHERS HAVE KIND OF TAKEN A OF. THE BACK OFFICE SENSUALLY TACIT APPROVAL- WITHOUT A FORMAL PERMIT PROGRAMS OF SAN DIEGO WITH THE LARGEST OF THE CITY'S UNTIL THEY- LAUNCHED A FORMAL PERMIT PROGRAM IN JANUARY- IN JULY OF THIS YEAR. AND THEN MANY CALIFORNIA CITIES TO HAVE PERMIT PROGRAMS AND THIS INCLUDES MANY OF THE CITY STILL HERE FROM FUTURE PANEL TODAY- BUT ALSO CITIES IS DIVERSE SOUTH LAKE TAHOE. THE CITY OF LONG BEACH. SO IN THESE PERMITTING PROGRAMS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT REQUIREMENT FOR SAFETY BUSINESS RULES PROGRAM EVALUATION. AND SOCIAL GOALS THAT THE HELP THESE PROGRAMS THAT THESE OPERATORS WILL HELP THEM ACHIEVE. TO THE SAFETY RULES INCLUDE HOURS OF OPERATION. RESTRICTED SPEED OR- RESTRICTED OPERATING AREAS AND WRITER EDUCATION AND HOW MAY GIVE AWAYS. THE BUSINESS RULES INCLUDE TYPICALLY INSURANCE- BONDS AND FEES. AND JENNIFER CATION REQUIREMENTS POINT OF CONTACT TO LEVEL OF SERVICE FOR CITY OR PUBLIC REQUESTS. FOR SERVICES THE NUMBER OF DEVICES THAT ARE PERMITTED AND THE LOCATIONS WHERE THEY CAN BE PLACED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY. AND THEN ANOTHER WEEK WILK REQUIREMENT IS FOR DATA SHARING TO ASSIST IN PROGRAM EVALUATION. THE DIVERSITY OF THESE PERMITTING PROGRAMS CAN HELP IDENTIFY REGULATORY MODELS THAT MAY BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING SOME OF THESE LOCAL GOALS- THE MOST FLEXIBLE THESE PERMIT PERMITTING PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY LOCAL ORDINANCE THAT REFERS TO ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS. AND CAN BE UPDATED AS NEW INFORMATION IS KNOWN ABOUT THIS INVOLVING BUSINESS MODEL BUT THE DOWNSIDE OF THIS ENVIRONMENT APPROACH AND REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY HAS BEEN A PATCHWORK THEY CAN BE CONFUSING TO USERS IN THE COMPANIES. SO BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WITH MORE. THANK YOU MISTER ARE YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME. DISCUSSING THE RELEASE OF POSITION DATA. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY WOULD A MUNICIPALITY WANT THAT DATA WHAT KIND OF DEEP DIVING ARE THEY DOING WITH IT. SO THERE IS THE POSITION OF A VEHICLE AVAILABLE FOR RENT AND SO THOSE ARE OFTEN RELEASED PUBLICLY BY THE PROVIDER SO IT SAYS THERE IS A DEVICE RIGHT HERE AT TEN TO NOW. THAT YOU CAN GET AND SCAN AND RENT AND THAT'S A MARKETING FUNCTION. THE VEHICLE POSITION OR THE TRIP POSITION DATA- IS CAN BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF MEANS SO SOME OF IT IS TRUST BUT VERIFY. TO MAKE SURE IF YOU DO HAVE A CAP ON THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DEVICES IN YOUR CITY- THAT THE FULL SUITE OF THE DATA REFLECTS THAT THE- OPERATOR IS- IT HEARING TO THAT CAP I SOME OF THAT IS LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF TRIPS THROUGHOUT THE CITY WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT SEEMS. LIKE HONEST DATA OTHERS JUST ASSISTING TRANSPORTATION PLANNING- THINKING ABOUT OF SAFETY FOR ALL ROAD USERS BY CLEANS IT CETERA UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT BETTER- INSTEAD OF DOING MANUAL COUNTS WHERE PEOPLE ARE USING BIKES OTHER TYPES OF DEVICES SO THIS IS A- KIND OF A BIG DATA APPROACH TO ASSIST WITH SOME OF THE OTHER. AREAS OF TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SAFETY FOR ROAD USERS. WOULD THAT BE. OBVIOUS IMAGES TO OVER ON YOUR TOWN YOU'D SEE WHAT KIND OF ACTIVITIES GOING ON WITH THE SCOOTERS. IT IT CAN BE BUT THAT TO DO THAT IN A SCIENTIFIC WAY- REQUIRE CERTAIN PROCEDURES OFTEN HIRING. AFRICAN JIM HEARING FROM DOING A SCREEN LINE COUNT FOR A PERIOD OF AN HOUR JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT MANIC TOTAL TREND THAT'S BEING OBSERVED AND THEN YOU MISS WHATEVER COUNTY YOU HAVE THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF. THE AREA THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT SO THIS TYPE OF DATA AND THIS ISN'T THE ONLY THING THAT THEY'RE USING IT FOR- CAN BE QUITE HELPFUL IN IN. VALIDATING WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS JUSTIFICATION FOR INVESTMENT IN A BIKE LANE- LOOKING IF THE BIKE LANE IS POTENTIALLY. PLAN TO BE IN THE RIGHT AREA OR A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING OTHER TYPES OF CUT THREE TRIPS- SO. THEN I GET A AND ONE OTHER QUESTION WOULD BE. AS HAS ANY MUNICIPALITY FIGURE OUT HOW TO FOR. FIND A FAIR SERVICE FEE OR USE IT AS A REVENUE SOURCE JUST LIKE THEY WOULD WITH TAXI COMPANIES AND OTHER. RENTAL ACTIVITIES. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY ANY COMPANY OR ANY CITY HAS FOUND SOMETHING THAT THE PROVIDERS ARE HAPPY WITH- I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW INVOLVING MODEL SO THERE MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION AND EVERY MARKETS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT AND SO CITIES HAVE DIFFERENT PROPENSITIES TO HAVE PEOPLE USING THESE DEVICES PEOPLE IN CITIES HAVE DIFFERENT ABILITIES AND WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR THE STOCK TYPE DEVICES SO THE. FEE MAY DIFFER AND PIANIST DIFFERENT THIS- RIALTO IS FROM- SANTA MONICA. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. WHEN ASKING QUESTIONS YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER HI I KNOW THIS ISN'T YOUR DATA IT'S THE THAT YOU'RE YOU'VE COMPILED. SO YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE OTHER STATES THAT ALLOW A SCOOTERS TO BE ON SIDEWALKS THAT WERE ONE OF A FEW THAT PROHIBITS THAT STATEWIDE. IS THERE ANY COMPARISON IN THE INJURY DATA FROM OUR SCOOTERS THAT ARE FORCED INTO THE STREET VERSUS STATES THAT ALLOW SCOOTERS ON SIDEWALKS. IS THERE ANY COMPARISON AT ALL TO SEE IF THAT REDUCES CERTAIN TYPES OF INJURIES I AM I'M NOT AWARE OF AN ANALYSIS THAT THAN THAT IS DONE EXACTLY THAT AND THEN DID YOU ALSO HAVE IT I'M SORRY IF I MISLED YOU HAVE STATISTIC ABOUT HOW MANY PEDESTRIANS ARE BADLY INJURED BY SCOOTERS IT WAS- FOR THE I DID NOT CITED- BUT FROM THE STUDIES I REVIEWED IT WAS. THE MID SINGLE DIGITS TO THE HIGH SINGLE DIGITS FROM THOSE VARIOUS CASES AND AUSTIN PORTLAND AND IN AUSTIN AND PORTLAND. OKAY THAT'S ALL I HAVE THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER MESSAGE. THANK YOU SO IN YOUR SURVEY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN DIFFERENT CITIES AS WELL AS DIFFERENT STATES IT DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION AS TO THE PROS AND CONS OF ALLOWING- LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ADOPT THEIR OWN- PUBLIC SAFETY RULES VERSUS HAVING US A MINIMUM. STATEWIDE STANDARDS. DO I HAVE OPINIONS- IF YOU DID IT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE WOULD BE A MIX RIGHT WE DON'T ALLOW THAT FOR. OF VEHICLES WE HAVE A UNIFORM CODE OF VEHICLES SIGNALS- RULES OF THE ROAD STATEWIDE AND THEN ALLOW LOCALS TO USE CERTAIN TOOLS IN THE TOOL KIT TO SAY OKAY YOU CAN'T GO HERE YOU CAN'T PARK HERE. AND SO IT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT IS THE RIGHT BALANCE WE HAVE A- LOT OF DIFFERENT. CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE STATE SO IT'S HARD TO THINK OF ONE UNIFORM STATEWIDE RULE OF THE ROAD WITHOUT ANY. LOCAL TWEAKING DESIGNATE CERTAIN AREAS THAT'S PERMISSIVE- X. EXCLUSIVE- WORKING WELL. DID YOU SEE ANY EXAMPLES WHERE IT MADE SENSE TO HAVE TO ALLOW US CITIES TO HAVE. YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR OWN. SAFETY RULES THAT MAY APPLY TO THEIR THEIR OWN LOCAL SEARCH A UNIQUE LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES- THEY MAY ARGUE AGAINST HAVING A STATEWIDE STANDARDS. SO YOU KNOW YOU WOULD THINK CERTAIN THINGS LIKE HOURS OF OPERATION MY- DEPEND. EXTENDING SIR ALCOHOL SERVICE HOURS IN CERTAIN AREAS SOME AREAS MAY BE MORE POPULAR FOR THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY AND YOU WOULD. PERHAPS ONE HAVE SME LOCAL FLEXIBILITY AND WHEN- THE- THE HOURS OF OPERATION WERE CUT OFF BECAUSE OF KIND OF THAT LOCAL DIVERSITY BUT. YEAH LUCKILY IT'S NOT MY JOB TO FIGURE THIS OUT IT'S ALL OF YOUR TH- AND I AM NOT AWARE OF A MODEL THAT- AT THIS POINT IS FINDING THAT RIGHT BALANCE. THANK YOU JERRY MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR JUST ONE OBSERVATION AND THEN NOT ONE QUESTION QUESTION FIRST IS ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE SEEN IN OTHER STATES THAT CALIFORNIA'S NOT TOUCHED OR ARE GETTING RIGHT. THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT. WHEN I WHEN I WAS READING THROUGH SOME OF THIS LEGISLATION I WHAT IS. DID STRIKE ME THAT THOSE THREE STATES THAT AUTHORIZED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REQUIRE. STUDENTS SCOOTER DATA SHARING- BUT SET A RESTRICTIONS ON HOW THAT DATA WAS COLLECTED. DATA PRIVACY- CONFIDENTIALITY TECHNICAL SECURITY ETCETERA. THE TEAM TO BE A GOOD BALANCE VERSUS RIGHT NOW HAVING IT COMPLETELY UP TO LOCAL PERMITTING PROCESSES- BECAUSE I DO RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF THAT DATA. AS A RESEARCHER BUT ALSO FOR THOSE OF. THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO HAVE TO REGULATE- THESE TYPES OF VICES AND WHATEVER MAY COME NEXT- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT EFFICIENTLY- WITH AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE AND- THOSE THAT. THE REGULATION ABOUT- HOW DATA WOULD BE COLLECTED DID SEEM TO BE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU HAD MENTIONED CONDITIONS IS ONE OF THE OF PROBLEMS WITH THE INJURY- WAS THERE ANY KIND OF SPECIFIC DATA COLLECTED THAT WOULD ACTUALLY IDENTIFY THE COULD BE USEFUL TO BE ABLE TO TRANSMIT THE CITIES THAT IT WAS THIS THAT OCCURRED AND TO BE THE YOU KNOW TO LOOK OUT FOR THIS KIND OF STUFF THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY. UTILIZE I THINK. TECHNICALLY THAT COULD BE POSSIBLE WITH THE SENSORS THAT ARE ON THE DEVICE IN THE INFORMATION THAT SHARED- I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY- IMPLEMENTATION THAT'S DOING THAT NOW LOOKING AT. CERTAIN JOBS TO DEVICES AND REPORTING THAT THERE MIGHT BE A POTHOLE AT THAT LOCATION. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO DID YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. WELL IT IS A LITTLE BIT ALONG THE LINE SAYS ASSEMBLYMEMBER LAURA FRIEDMAN I KNOW SHIELDS FOR DAD I'M THINKING OF FIVE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES YOU KNOW BEING INJURED AS WELL BECAUSE I JUST WONDER WHAT GOES UNDER REPORTED YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE- I HAD THE THIRD ARE. VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS WORK. I GUESS I'M CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT AND. SO I. AM WORRIED ABOUT THE UNDER REPORTING BIAS OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND THE SO THAT'S WHY I. WASN'T ABLE TO COMPARE THIS MODE OF TRANSPORTATION WITH OTHERS- AND SO THE AN INSTANCE WHERE SOMEBODY'S PATH OF TRAVEL ON A SIDEWALK IT'S BLOCKED BY. ONE OF THESE DEVICES AYE BUT NOT IN A WHEELCHAIR BUT I PUSH A STROLLER OFTEN AND I'VE HAD THIS- SITUATION HAPPEN TO ME- IT'S- NOT SOMETHING THAT IS TYPICALLY REPORTED SO THERE I THINK COULD BE AN UNDER REPORTING BIAS WITH WITH SOME OF THESE. ENGINE WITH THE- EIGHTY A ACCESS AND OTHER ASPECTS. THE QUEST CENTER. I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THESE DEVICES BEING JUST DUMPED IN REMOTE AREAS PARKS WHERE- THEY'RE NOT EASILY ACCESSIBLE BY THE PUBLIC IN YOU THEN YOU'D FIND THAT THEY'RE JUST SORT OF LAYING AROUND LIKE ABANDONED SHOPPING CARTS AND THAT SOMEBODY FROM THE COMPANY HAS TO GO AND RETRIEVE THEM MORE IS THAT IN A PROBLEM- SO SOME OF THE- LITERATURE. TO HAS CITED SOME OF THESE DEVICES BEING PULLED OUT OF LIKE MERIT IN OAKLAND OUT OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN DURING BEACH CLEAN UP SO THAT IS A PROBLEM IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT CITIES WANT TO HAPPEN AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMPANIES I THINK ARE MOTIVATED FOR ECONOMIC MEANS TO TRY TO AVOID HAPPENING BUT IT THIS LOSS OF- DEVICES DUE TO THESE MECHANICAL PROBLEMS VANDALISED SOME OR- JUST- HIDING DAMAGE THEFT IS. BEEN SOMETHING THAT I THINK IT'S PLAGUED THE LONGEVITY OF THE FIRST FEW GENERATIONS OF DEVICES THAT WERE DEPLOYED IN CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY I'M JUST WONDERING IF IT'S IF IT'S A LOSS OF THE DEVICE TO NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THEFT VANDALISM BUT AT. A ONE WAY TRIP TO TAKE IN AND IT'S JUST LEFT SOMEWHERE WHERE IT'S NOT AND IT PLACE FOR SOMEBODY WOULD READILY BE WANTING TO USE IT PER SE IF AND IT MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE FOR THE COMPANIES TO EMPLOY- WAR CONTRACT WITH PEOPLE TO RE BALANCE SO TO COLLECT FROM. THESE TYPES OF AREAS TO BRING BACK WITHIN A SERVICE HERE AT TO CHARGEOVERNIGHT TO MAINTAIN- BUT CHALLENGE BEING THAT IF. THE DEVICE MALFUNCTIONS AND NO LONGER REPORTS ITS LOCATION. THEY CAN'T FIND IT SO- BUT IN GENERAL THERE IS HOPE A MECHANISM FOR THAT OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE CENTER NEAR SACRAMENTO THANK YOU SO MUCH DO APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING TIME THANK YOU AND THANKS FOR TRAVELING YOUR SACRAMENTO AS WELL IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AND WE SHOULD TIME YOU PEND ON THE PHONE AS WELL PERFECT. THANK YOU SO MUCH WELCOME THANK YOU SIR. PLEASE IN GERMAN.THANK YOU SO MUCH VISITS HERE WERE NOT TO BE MOVING ON TO THE SECOND PANEL THE SECOND PANELS CAN BE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PAST THE BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS. OF STATEWIDE REGULATION TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES AND WHAT WE CAN LEARN GOING FORWARD ESPECIALLY RICHARD MOBILITY DEVICES. ORGAN IN BY JARVIS UP HE'S WITH- FOR PAUL FOR HIGHER POLICY IN ENFORCEMENT. HE'S A MINISTRY- WITHIN THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION. WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT HE'S HERE TODAY AND WE'RE ALSO APPRECIATIVE THAT KATE IS HERE. KATE IS THE DIRECTOR OF TAXIS AND ACCESSIBLE SERVICES FOR SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. THEY'RE GONNA BE SHOWING ENSURING THEIR PERSPECTIVE COME ON UP HERE AND YOU ALL DON'T MIND JUST JOINING US HERE AT THE TABLE. THEY'RE GOING T BE- TALKING ABOUT ALL ISSUES IN REGARDS TO WHAT THEY SEE ON THE GROUND. BOTH IN A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP. WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY- GONNA LOOK TO BOTH OF YOU WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO. KICK US OFF IF YOU DON'T MIND ALSO FORMALLY INTRODUCING YOURSELVES ONE LAST TIME. HI YOU HAVE. FIVE MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND WARNING WHO'D LIKE TO KICK US OFF. PLEASE THE FORESHORES YOUR FIVE MINUTES AND WELCOME THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATE TORRENT AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF TAXIS% AND ACCESSIBLE SERVICES AT THE SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT LESSONS WE'VE LEARNED IN SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE OPERATION OF TNC IS ON OUR CITY STREETS. AND PROVIDE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS MOVING FORWARD THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING. THE MTA HAS BEEN AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE C. P. UC'S TNC RULE MAKING PROCESS WHICH BEGAN IN TWENTY TWELVE AND IS STILL ON GOING. TO DATE WE'VE SUBMITTED ABOUT FIFTY SETS OF COMMENTS OUTLINING OUR POLICY CONCERNS AND RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO TNC HE'S- SHARED CITY AND STATE GOALS. MTA SHARES THE STATE'S AMBITIOUS GOALS RELATED TO IMPROVING SAFETY REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION SERVICES TO COMMUNITIES OF CONCERN AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. I'LL DISCUSS THE IMPACT OF TEEN SEASON SAN FRANCISCO THROUGH THE LENS OF THE SHARED PRIORITIES. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT TEEN SEASON SAN FRANCISCO. AS A LOCAL ENTITY MTA DOES NOT HAVE REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER TNC EASE OR ACCESS TO CONSISTENT DATA ABOUT HOW THEY OPERATE ON OUR CITY STREETS. THIS IS BEEN A CHALLENGE BUT ARE RESOURCEFUL COLLEAGUES AT THE SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY CONGESTION MANAGEMENT AGENCY ANALYZE TNC TRIPS THAT BEGAN AND ENDED WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO DURING FALL TWENTY SIXTEEN. WELL NOT INCLUSIVE OF ALL TNC TRIPS IMPACTING SAN FRANCISCO THE RESULTS WERE STILL QUITE SHOCKING THE IMPACTS ARE VERY REAL ON OUR CITY STREETS FOR EXAMPLE ON A TYPICAL WEEK DAY 15% OF ALL TRIPS THAT START IN AND WITHIN THE CITY BONDARIES WERE MADE BY T. AND SEES. WHICH IS ABOUT TWELVE TIMES A NUMBER OF TAXI TRIPS. TEEN SEES ACCOUNTED TNC TRIPS ACCOUNTED 450% OF THE INCREASE IN CONGESTION BETWEEN TWENTY TEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. IN A MORE RECENT STUDY USING DATA FROM SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN FERRON PEERS FOUND THAT TNC IS ACCOUNT 413% OF VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN THE CORE OF SAN FRANCISCO. WHY IT MATTERS. TNC OPERATIONS CAN CREATE SAFETY HAZARDS FOR ALL ROAD USERS. TNC OPERATIONS OFTEN RESULT IN RISKY TRAVEL AND DRIVING BEHAVIOR INCLUDING PICK UPS AND DROP OFFS ANDNON DESIGNATED. DESIGNATED ZONES WHICH OFTEN RESULT IN CONFLICTS WITH OTHER ROAD USERS. SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT DATA FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN INDICATES THAT TNC IS COMPRISED FRANCISCO'S DOWNTOWN CORE. THESE DANGEROUS PICK UP AND DROP OFF BEHAVIORS LEAD TO HAZARDS IN INJURIES TO CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS AND ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INTERFERE WITH TRANSIT VEHICLES. MORE TNC VEHICLES ON THE STREETS CAN LEAD TO MORE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AS NOTED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PROGRESS REPORT ON CALIFORNIA'S SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES IN CLIMATE PROTECTION ACT CALIFORNIA IS NOT ON TRACK TO MEET ITS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS THE REPORT NOTES THAT PASSENGER MILES TRAVELED ARE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. IN INCREASE IN TNC PRIVATE VEHICLE ACTIVITY IS DIRECTLY AT ODDS WITH THE STATE'S FORWARD THINKING TRANSPORTATION GOALS EMBEDDED IN POLICIES AND GRANT PROGRAMS SUCH AS REDUCING TRIPS TAKEN IN SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLES. DOUBLING TRANSIT RIDERSHIP AND TRIPLING BICYCLE USE. MASS TRANSIT REMAINS THE MOST EFFICIENT AND SUSTAINABLE FORM OF TRANSPORTATION. IT HAS BEEN OUR LONG STANDING GOAL TO MAKE TRANSIT THE MOST APPEALING TRAVEL CHOICE AND SHIFT PEOPLE TO OUR MUNY SYSTEM WHICH IS EVEN MORE CRITICAL NOW GIVEN SAN FRANCISCO'S GROWING POPULATION AND LIMITED RIGHT OF WAY. AND OF COURSE OUR CLIMATE GOALS. PNC'S PARKING AND BUS OWNS OUR BUS ONLY LANES ABSTRACT TRANSIT SLOWING DOWN UP TO EIGHTY OR MORE PEOPLE ON THE BUS. MOREOVER THE INCREASE CONGESTION CAUSED BY T. AND SEES FLOWS DOWN BUSES THAT SHARE THE RIGHT OF WAY WHICH IS WHY IN TA HAS INVESTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND BUS ONLY LANES AND BUS RAPID TRANSIT. TNC IS HAVE STATED THAT ONE OF THEIR GOALS IS TO PROVIDE FIRST AND LAST MILE CONNECTIONS TO TRANSIT THAT'S A WORTHY GOAL BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MEASURE PROGRESS WITHOUT SUPPORTING INFORMATION. TNC SERVICE IS NOT ACCESSIBLE TO ALL. EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN PUBLIC TRANSIT PLANNING AND OPERATIONS AT THE MTA. TNC IS ARE NOT CURRENTLY ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE INCLUDING PEOPLE USING WHEELCHAIRS AND THOSE WITHOUT SMARTPHONES CREDIT CARDS OR BANK ACCOUNTS. WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE PROGRESS ON TNC PROVISION OF ACCESSIBLE SERVICES WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX. WHICH REQUIRES A PER TRIP FEE TO FIND ACCESSIBLE TNC SERVICES AN MTA IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS LEGISLATION. TNC SERVICES HAVE SEVERELY IMPACTED THE TAXI INDUSTRY. THE RISE OF TEEN SEES AND THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY THE CPC AS WELL AS WHAT APPEARS TO BE MINIMAL ENFORCEMENT HAVE SEVERELY IMPACTED TAXI SERVICES THE TAXI REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IS A LONG STANDING THE STATE HAS BROAD TAXI HAS SET BROAD TAXI REQUIREMENTS AND ALLOWS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ESTABLISH ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS. THERE'S NOT A QUOTE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD IN TERMS OF TAXI AND TNC REGULATIONS IF ABOUT ONE MINUTE OKAY WOW. I HAVE A LOT TO SAY. THANK YOU SO I'M JUST GOING TO CUT TO THE CHASE AND I'M GOING TO MENTION- ARE THREE BROAD RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS- REGULATION OF PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES SHOULD BE DRIVEN BY STATE WHY TRANSPORTATION GOALS. TO REGULATIONS OF PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION SERVICE MUST BE TAILORED TO THE DYNAMICS OF DIFFERENT MARKETS AND THE STATE SHOULD ALLOW A CITY OR COUNTY TO ADOPT ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOURTEEN AND SEES TO OPERATE IN ITS JURISDICTION. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE IN IT AND OBVIOUSLY A LOT MORE TO SAY ON THIS TOPIC SO. THAT'S THE MYSTERY NAY IN VERY GRATEFUL SO WELL IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU- WILL HAVE YET TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND. AS QUESTIONS COME UP OF THAT WORKS FOR YOU I'M HAPPY TO. TO WHATEVER WORKS FOR THE COMMITTEE I DON'T THINK YOU SO MUCH IT REALLY MEANS A LOT YOU'RE HEARING THANK YOU FOR BRING YOUR EXPERTISE TO THE COMMUNITY. THEY WERE VERY GRATEFUL. NOW CAN WE TURN IT OVER TO OUR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE MR MURRAY. AND I'M SORRY THE FLOOR SHORTS YOU DON'T MIND REDUCING YOURSELF WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE THANK YOU FOR TRAVELLING NORTH TODAY. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE. AND THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING OUR COMMENTS HERE TODAY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US. MY NAME IS JARVIS MURRAY I AM THE FOR HIRE POLICY ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATOR FOR. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- MUCH LIKE THIS TORRENT HERE WE REGULATE TAXICABS. AS WELL AS AMBULANCES NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION. AND SHUTTLES AND ALSO- MICRO TRANSIT TO A CERTAIN DEGREE SO. IN LOS ANGELES WE REGULATE QUITE A BIT IN TERMS OF THE FOR HIRE VEHICLE SPACE. MUCH I FRANKLY AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT MR AND IS ALREADY STATED HERE. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I THINK THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS THAT. BECAUSE WE HAVE A TWO TIERED SYSTEM AND WE'RE UNABLE TO HAVE ANY DATA FROM THE TNC EASE. WE HAVE A HODGE PODGE OF REGULATION NOW BETWEEN THE FOR HIRE VEHICLES THAT CURRENTLY THERE ARE REGULATED BY CITIES. FOR HARD VEHICLES ARE REGULATED THROUGH THE STATE. IN LOS ANGELES AND I THINK THIS IS TRUE ALSO IN SAN FRANCISCO. OUR GOALS ARE ARE RELATIVELY SIMPLE IN TERMS OF WE LOOK FOR THE FOR HIRE SPACE AND WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY. EQUITY ACCESSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY. AGAIN THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE FOCUS ON HEAVILY WITH ARE REGULATED SPACE SUCH AS TAXICABS AND AMBULANCES AND NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL BUT WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THIS AS IT RELATES TO UBER AND LIFT OR ANY OTHER TNC MODEL. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SAFETY SPACE DRIVERS IN TAXICABS THIS IS TRUE ALSO IN SAN FRANCISCO ARE FINGERPRINTED FOR BACKGROUNDS AS WELL AS DRUG TESTED. TAXICABS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR OUR ACCESS PROGRAM WHICH ARE ELDERLY AND DISABLED PROGRAM. 65% OF THOSE TRIPS ARE SUBCONTRACTED THROUGH OUR TAXI CAB PROVIDERS AND ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT THROUGH THIS FEDERAL PROGRAMS BECAUSE- A PRINTED. AND DRUG TESTED. IT'S AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION FOR CITY AS AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION FOR RESIDENTS. IN TERMS OF SAFETY IT'S A TNC DRIVER. LET'S SAY- FOR ANY TNC A TEENSY DRIVER AND DOES SOMETHING THAT ON TOWARD TOWARD THE PASSENGER UNLESS IT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF AN ARREST WE'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR ABOUT IT. IF ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS IN THE TAXICABS SPACE OR EVEN MY NOT EMERGENCY MEDICAL SPACE WE HEAR ABOUT IT FIRST AND WE MANAGE IT AND WE HANDLE IT WHETHER IT'S A COMPLAINT. WHETHER IT'S AN ARREST. OUR CITIES REGULATE THOSE ISSUES. FOR NEWER DRIVERS ARRESTED OR SOMETHING HAPPENS BE MAY BE DEACTIVATED IMPROPER FORM. WE MAY WE DON'T WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW IF THAT'S HAPPENING. BUT EVEN IF THEY ARE. THERE'S NOTHING THAT NECESSARILY PREVENTS THEM FROM CONTINUING TO DRIVE FOR LIFT AND AS MANY OF YOU ALREADY LIKELY SEE. MANY DRIVERS HAVE AN UBER AND LIFT STICKER. SO SOMETHING HAPPENS ON ONE PLATFORM IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT HAPENS TO THEM ON THE OTHER PLATFORM. IF SOMETHING HAPPENS WITH OUR DRIVERS IN THE TAXI CAB SPACE. IF I HAVE A YELLOW CAB DRIVER THAT DOES SOMETHING ON TOUR TO A PASSENGER WE REMOVE THEM. THEY CAN GO TO ANOTHER CAP COMPANY ANYWHERE IN LOS ANGELES WHY BECAUSE WE MANAGE THEIR PERMIT. WE'RE THE ONES WHO KNOW WHAT GOES ON WE KNOW EVERY SINGLE DRIVER THAT OPERATES IN OUR CITY. WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS WITH THE DRIVERS AND TEA AND SEES. IN TERMS OF EQUITY WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT REDLINING. WE'RE VERY LARGE CITY. POWER ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE MILES. BETWEEN FOUR FIVE MILLION IN POPULATION THAT'S JUST FOR THE CITY OUR COUNTY IS CLOSE TO FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE MILES WITH A POPULATION OF ABOUT TEN MILLION PEOPLE. AND WITH THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO US THAT SERVICES ON THE WEST SIDE. ARE JUST AS GOOD AS SERVICES ON THE EAST SIDE OR THE SOUTH RIM THE NORTH PART OF THE CITY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE EQUIVALENT SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE FIGHT HARD FOR OUR TAXICABS SPACE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT AGAIN WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER AND THE TNC SPACES. ACCESSIBILITY MYSTERON MENTION. WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBILITY IS SOMETHING THAT ALL TAXICABS WE FOCUS ON HAPPILY WE REQUIRE PERCENTAGE OF OUR FLEET TO BE WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE. THE SAN FRANCISCO FLEET IN THE EXACT SAME THING. CURRENTLY TNC FOR THE MOST PART. ARE NOT WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE. I DON'T THINK ANYONE THERE YOU KNOW AND I THINK THEY MAY BE HERE TODAY THEY CAN TALK ABOUT THAT THEMSELVES WITH WE'LL HAVE WE'LL CHECK SENSIBILITY IN THE TNC SPACES. MAY MAY BE ABLE TO CONTRACT NOW WITH OTHER. OUTSIDE ENTITIES BUT AGAIN AS A CITY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND WE DO A OF THE PRETTY HARD JOB TRYING TO PUT THAT TOGETHER MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS FOR THEM. AND THEN FINALLY WHAT SUSTAINABILITY. WE'RE PUSHING OUR PROGRAM TO MOVE MORE TOWARDS AN EEVEE FUTURE AND TWO IS MORE CLEAN AIR FUTURE. THAT'S BECAUSE WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT VEHICLES ARE IN OUR FLEETS AND AGAIN MISTER RANKIN ALSO PROBABLY TELL YOU ALL TAXI CAB VEHICLES IN OUR FLEET SECOND TELL YOU WHICH SHUTTLES WE HAVE WHICH AMBULANCES WE HAVE THEIR MAKE THEIR MODEL THEIR YEAR. AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE THEM TOWARDS A CLEANER AND CLEANER AND CLEANER MODEL TO. ALLEVIATE AND MEET ALL OF OUR GREENHOUSE GREENHOUSE GASKELL'S. BUT ONE MINUTE. AND SO AGAIN THESE ARE THINGS BECAUSE WE HAVE NO DATA NO INFORMATION ON TNC DRIVERS OF INFORMATION I TNC VEHICLES. OF NO CONTROL OVER THEM WE ARE UNABLE TO USE. THAT FOR HIGHER SERVICE TO HELP ASSIST US IN MEETING THESE GOALS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO USE AND HELP ASSISTANCE WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE GOALS WE CAN USE IN TEXAS AS WITH OUR CONGESTION GOALS- WERE ABLE TO HELP THEM IN TERMS OF PRICING. EVEN IN TERMS OF RACE FOR THE DRIVERS WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP THEIR DRIVERS WHO MAY BE SUFFERING FROM THEIR RATES WERE AS TAXI CAB DRIVERS WE MANAGE THEIR RATES AS WELL. IN LA WE ARE CREATING A FRAMEWORK THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE A OF A HOST OF FOR HIGHER VEHICLE OPTIONS AND BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF DATA AND INFORMATION OF THE LACK OF CONTROL OVER TEA AND SEES. WE FRANKLY ARE UNABLE TO PLUG THEM INTO THAT SYSTEM THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ACTUALLY SERVE OUR CITIZENS AND THE PEOPLE OF LOS ANGELES MUCH ETTER- THANK YOU AND IF YOU HAVE ANY.ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WE'RE HERE FOR THAT DON'T THINK YOU SO MUCH SO- EXTRAPOLATING WHAT YOU HAD. SEEN THE TEEN SEES. AND PUT IT OVER TOWARD SO SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES. SO ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD IS. NEED TO BE A FOCUS I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT THE- FOCUS OF THIS HEARING WE'RE GONNA HEARING IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY AND THE ISSUE OF DATA. BY DATE IS IMPORTANT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I AND IF YOU WERE TO START OVER. WOULD LOOK AT SOME TYPE OF STANDARD FOR DATA. WOULD THAT BE- CORRECT I DON'T WANNA PROJECT ON TO EACH OF YOU SO EARLY SOME FOR US THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AND JUST SO YOU'RE AWARE WE- BECAUSE WE'RE SUCH A BIG STATE BECAUSE MANY OF THESE COMPANIES START HERE FIRST IN CALIFORNIA. MANY OTHERS JURISDICTIONS ACTUALLY CALL US TO LOOK TO US AND SAY WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING AND- AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW THE CITY OF NEW YORK AND CHICAGO AND TORONTO. IN PORTLAND SEATTLE THEY'RE LOOKING AT OUR MISTAKES BECAUSE THIS IS SEEN THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY AS A MAJOR MISTAKE THAT. THE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE UNABLE TO COLLECT ANY DATA RELATED TNC TRIPS. AND THEM I DON'T KNOW YEAH I CONCUR WITH WHAT MR MURRAY SAID IN THAT IT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ASPECT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING ON OUR CITY STREETS ND AGAIN TO UNDERSTAND ARE WE MEETING OUR GOALS. YOU HAVE THESE VERY- IMPORTANT STATE GOALS AND IT'S HARD TO ASSESS IT FOR MEETING THEM IF WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING ON OUR STREETS. IN ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES DATA THAT YOU WERE SAY OKAY WE START OVER. ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK AT AGAIN THAT'S WHY WE HIT CANADA THE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THESE TWO FANTASTIC AUTHORS. PAS BUT MAYBE TO SEE. WHAT WE NEED AS DECEMBER INDUSTRY EMERGES. ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WOULD GET EXTRAPOLATE FOURTEEN SEIZE. OVERTURN SCOOTERS NEW BIKES THAT. YOU SEE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THE FIRST. WELL SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IN OUR INTEREST TO US THAT IF WE WERE TO START OVER AND IN THE TNC SPACES IF WE WERE TO START OVER WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOOK AT WE WANT TO KNOW WHO THE DRIVERS WHERE WE WANT TO KNOW- WHAT THEY'RE DOING FOR ACCESSIBILITY BECAUSE AGAIN WHEN EVERYONE STARTS THESE THINGS THE NEW INNOVATIVE FRAMEWORKS THEY TALK A LOT ABOUT HOW FUN AND EXCITING IT IS AND HOW NEW IT IS BUT EVERYONE FORGETS ABOUT- THE PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD IT PERHAPS WITH AREAS THAT MAY NOT GET THIS THING FIRST. OR EVEN OUR OUR DISABLE CLIENTELE- WE THINK ABOUT WHO'S ON THE STREET WHO HAS TO USE OUR STREETS ARE WHEELCHAIR USERS ARE THOSE WHO ARE- VISION IMPAIRED THOSE WHO ARE HEARING IMPAIRED THESE ARE THINGS WE BE CONCERNED ABOUT AND EVEN IN TERMS OF IF WE WERE TO MOVE THIS TO THE MICRO MOBILITY SPACE THE QUESTION WOULD ALSO BE FOR US WHAT WE DO FOR A WHEELCHAIR CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE TO STILL USE THE SIDEWALK AND THEY'RE STILL ON THEIR LINE DOWN THE SIDEWALK. FOR THE VISION IMPAIRED PERSON IS USED TO STICK IN FEES WITH THE WHITE CAME THAT THERE'S SOMETHING IN COMPETING THEIR WAY YOU KNOW HOW DO WE MANAGE REMOVAL OF THAT YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE AS A LOCALITY WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND NUMEROUS THOSE THINGS IN THE TNC SPACE WE'D WANT TO STAND WITH THE ROUTE WHAT DRIVERS AROUND. WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT TYPE OF VEHICLE THAT. CAME UP WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT. RESULT AND SO THAT WE. PLAY FOR THE SAKE OF REGULATING. FOR THE SAKE OF ENSURING THE SAFETY GOALS ARE MET ENSURING THAT OUR EQUITY GOALS ARE MET IN ASSURING THAT I WILL CHECK SENSIBLE GOALS ARE MET THANK YOU YEAH I WOULD CONCUR AN AD THAT- BECAUSE THAT IMPACTS ARE FELT MOST ACUTELY LOCALLY THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE LOCAL ABILITY TO REGULATE MANAGE AND ADMINISTER A PROGRAM WHAT WE FOUND IN SAN FRANCISCO ONE WE WERE ABLE TO REGULATE THE- SCOOTERS FOR EXAMPLE AN AND NO THIS IS A TOPIC OF THE NEXT PANEL BUT- WE WENT FROM. THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS AND CONSUMER CONCERNS AND SCOOTERS ALL OVER AND BLOCKING SIDEWALKS AND BLOCKING THE ACCESSIBLE PATH OF TRAVEL TO HAVING A PERMIT PROGRAM WHERE NOW WE REQUIRE THE SCOOTERS TO BE LOCKED SO THEY'RE OUT OF THE WAY OF THE ACCESSIBLE PATH OF TRAVEL WE'VE MANAGE THE- THE COMPLAINTS WE HAVE A STRUCTURE PROCESS TO BE RESPONSIVE AND WERE ALLOWED TO FORCE LOCALLY- NOT A MOVING VIOLATION FOR OPERATING ON THE SIDEWALK. RELATED TO THE PERMIT CONDITIONS AND SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO REGULATE MANAGE WHAT HAPPENS ON THE CITY STREETS CITY SIDEWALKS SO I THINK THEY'RE A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE TNC INTO A WHILE I THINK A AS MR MATUTE A. SAID A- HYBRID MODEL WHERE THE STATE SET SOME BROAD GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND THEN THERE'S LOCAL BILLET TO SET ADDITIONAL- PERMIT CONDITIONS OTHER REQUIREMENTS. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH AND TURN OVER THE CHAIRMAN WILL GO TO THE VICE CHAIR. PLEASE THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER. WHAT INFORMATION ARE YOU LACKING FROM THE CPUC. AS YOU TALK ABOUT IS THE INABILITY IN PAIRS WITH IS KNOWN INDIVIDUAL PLAN TO SEE THE ACTUAL REGULATES SO- ANY DATA THAT THE TNC IS PROVIDE TO THE CBC IS NOT MADE AVAILABLE PUBLICLY IT'S ALL PROVIDED UNDER SEAL SO NUMBER OF TRIPS- GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE SERVICES IN THE NEED FOR THOSE SERVICES. THE CPUC POSE THE QUESTION BACK TO THE PARTIES- HOW MANY ACCESSIBLE TRANSPORTATION TRIPS ARE HAPPENING AND THERE WAS NO ABILITY AS A PUBLIC AGENCY TO ANSWER THAT OR UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE ALSO FEES THAT THE CPC COLLECTS FROM- TEEN SEES THEY WERE REDUCED A COUPLE YEARS AGO- WE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WERE VERY CURIOUS HOW MUCH HAS BEEN COLLECTED IN WHAT HAS IT BEEN SPENT ON. AND WHY REDUCE WE HAVE SOME IDEAS ON WHERE THAT MONEY COULD BE SPENT IT COULD BE SPENT TO SUPPORT LOCAL ENFORCEMENT DISABILITY ACCESS THIS BEFORE THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX- BUT THOSE ARE IN BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HOW MUCH IS COLLECTED WHERE IT WENT WHAT TYPE OF IN FORCE AND HAPPENING THERE IS A STATE LAW THAT- TEEN. COMMERCIAL DRIVERS CAN ONLY DO HAVE CERTAIN- ON OF CONSECUTIVE HOURS ALSO THERE'S THAT STATE LAW ON THE BOOKS BUT WE'RE NOT SURE IS IT BEING ENFORCED OR. NOT SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE. JUST FOLLOW THAT UP WITH A IT DID YOU WANT TO ADD ON TO THAT I'M SORRY I'M NO THAT'S WORK EXPERIENCE IN THE EXACT SAME THING LOS ANGELES WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN ANY DATA AND- EVEN IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT WE'RE FRANKLY. I'M SURE OF THE CDC HAS THE RESOURCES TO ENFORCE IN THE CITY CRITICALLY OF OUR SIZE WHERE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD A POINT NINE MILLION TNC TRIPS COME OUT OF LAX- LAST YEAR. AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE I DON'T KNOW HOW LARGE THE PCS BUT I'M CERTAIN THEIR ENFORCEMENT CANNOT COVER. EVEN JUST AND THAT'S JUST THE NUMBERS WE KNOW- FROM LA X. IT WAS AND TELL US I MEAN DRIVERS WE HAVE- AND THAT'S JUST FOR. THAT AIRPORT SO THOSE NUMBERS ALONE SHOULD TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT LOS ANGELES APART LOOKING AT. HUNDREDS MAYBE OF OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DRIVERS. AND AGAIN. WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ON IF THAT'S ACTUALLY ACCURATE. OR NOT WE HAVE NO INFORMATION. THAT MIGHT BE A HEARING IN ITS OWN. ONE OTHER QUESTION- TO BOTH YOU AS OF- JANUARY FIRST- AB FIVE WILL BE. PUT INTO LAW WHICH WILL MAKE TNC OPERATORS EMPLOYEES. AT THISPOINT- DO YOU FEEL THAT THERE WILL BE AN ABILITY TO WORK WITH HI DATA COLLECTION ON AS A WHOLE AS AN EMPLOYER VERSES INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS HAVING TO. DO YOU FEEL WHAT HE FEELS GOING ON THERE IS MOVING THE BALL AS FAR AS- RESPONSIBILITY AND- OF REPORTING. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING I HAVE NOT. HEARD THOSE TWO TOPICS PAIRED LIKE THAT AND SO I THINK THAT'S INSIGHTFUL- FOR US TO FOLLOW UP ON- BUT AS IT STANDS WITH THE CPC AT THIS POINT THERE IS NO ABILITY TO ACCESS ANY OF THAT DATA SO I'M NOT SURE IF THE EMPLOYMENT STATUS IS GOING TO ALLOW SOME TYPE OF ENTREE. BUT CERTAINLY WORTH PURSUING IN ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS. AND I AGREE WITH MR WITH MISS TO OUR AND I THINK THE ISSUE WITH THAT IS SIMPLY. FOR EXAMPLE OF NEW YORK CITY HAS A REQUIREMENT THAT TNC DRIVERS HAVE TO MAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THIS SPACE UT I UTILIZATION. BUT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALL THE DATA THEY KNOW WHO THE DRIVERS ARE THEY KNOW HOW MANY DRIVERS THERE THERE ARE AND THEY CAN SEE WHAT THE UTILIZATION THIS SO THAT THE- MAN THEY ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE. HOW MUCH HAS TO BE PUT IN TO ENSURE THAT THE DRIVER EARNS ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP WORKING. FOUR GUYS OF THE CHANGED AB FIVE IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT DATA. IT'S UNKNOWN TO US WHETHER THEY'RE GONNA BE MAKING THE IN THE REQUISITE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY NEED TO SURVIVE IN LOS ANGELES OR NOT SO. AGAIN DATA IS REALLY THE KEY. ON THOSE ISSUES AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATA. THEN IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGES COULD OCCUR WITH AB FIVE. IT HAS SOLD HIS. HOME WHAT I'M- TAKING IN. FROM YOUR STATEMENTS BUT SEE IF YOU SEE THAT THEY MAY BE OVERWHELMED. OF NOT ONLY IN FIRE SITUATIONS BUT- IN THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS ALSO IN THAT WE MAY HAVE TO BIFURCATE THIS AGENCIES SO IT. RESPONSIBILITY ACTUALLY CAN BE EFFECTIVE- TO MANAGE AND ALSO AID LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN THEIR EFFORTS. WELL WE'RE CERTAINLY HERE TO BE A PARTNER WITH- AND FORCING AND HELPING TO MANAGE TNC OPERATIONS. RIGHT WE WANT TO BE A PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM AND THEY'VE DONE A GOOD SERVICE SO FAR I MEAN IN TERMS OF THAT BUT IN ORDER TO HELP US. MOVE FORWARD IN THE FUTURE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME SAY IN WHAT GOES ON. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. MR VICE CHAIR WE'RE GONNA GO TO. SENATOR BELL A CHEESY BREAD GO TO THE VICE CHAIR I APOLOGIZE SENATOR BAIL. AND THEN TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN. AND THEN ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO. SPEAK PLEASE VICE CHAIR THE FORESHORES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MR MURRAY YOU'RE HERE ON AN- AUSPICIOUS DAY YOU I'VE- MADE IT TO THE FRONT. PAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA SECTION OF THE LA TIMES. WHERE THE CITY IS PULLED. HOOVER'S PERMIT. AND SO IF I IF I COULD JUST READ A PARAGRAPH FOUR I'M STILL TRYING TO. GET MY ARMS AROUND IT SAYS THE SUSPENSION FOLLOWS MONTHS OF TENSION AND FAILED ATTEMPTS. AT COMPROMISE BETWEEN UBER IN THE CITY OVER A DATA SHARING RULE. AND ALWAYS WHEN YOUR PILOT PERMIT PROGRAM. COMPANIES MUST SHARE REAL TIMEDATA ON ALL TRIPS MADE WITHIN THE CITY. INCLUDING THE START POINT. IN POINT AND TRAVEL TIME. AND I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THAT'S SO CRITICAL SO MAYBE THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS. DO WE REQUIRE THAT FOR TAXI DRIVERS. THAT YELLOW CAB TO IT TO ALL PROVIDED TO THE CITY. YES WE DO AND ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IN TERMS OF- SEE LOS ANGELES IS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE THAT TO REAL TIME DATA. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW TECHNOLOGICALLY TAXICABS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO KEEP UP. WITH THE TIMES WE KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS. SO THEY PROVIDE DATA TO US MONTHLY ON WHETHER TRIPS ARE HOW MANY TRIPS- BUT- APPARENTLY IT'S SOMEONE WHO'S BRING IN THAT INFORMATION IN A FORMAT THAT'S NOT REALLY USABLE FOR US IN. ANYMORE AND SO AND WE'RE GONNA BE MOVING THEM ONTO A PLATFORM MUCH LIKE WE DO WITH OTHER SCOOTERS IN LOS ANGELES. THAT ALLOWS US TO SEE WHAT GOES ON AND WHERE THE CHIPS ARE WITH THE TAXICABS. AND WE'RE GONNA BE MOVING THIS TO ALL OF OUR FOR HIGHER VEHICLES ARE SHUTTLES AS WELL AS OUR NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL- EVENTUALLY THROUGHOUT. THE NEXT YEAR. TO INTEREST TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR VEHICLES AT. YOU KNOW AT ALL TIMES THAT WE CAN BETTER. SERVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST CREATING ZONES- SEEING WHERE THE CHIPS ARE AND- PREVENTING THE RED LINING ISSUES SO. THE TECHNOLOGY CURRENTLY EXIST. WE'RE MOVING THEM INTO THAT FRAMEWORK. AND WE EXPECT EVERYONE TO BE FOLLOWING. THAT FRAMEWORK WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR SO. THAT'S FOR. HELPFUL TO ME- THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE BECAUSE I'M A- NO BETTER NO WORSE KIND OF PERSON IF. TAXI COME TO RE DOING IT THEN TNC IS. SHOULD BE DOING LIKE I OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT SO WITH THE DATA FROM THE TAXI COMPANIES- IN BOTH CITIES BOTH THEIR AREAS- ARE WE ARE WE SEEING MORE PEOPLE THAN USING. SOME FORM OF TRANSPORTATION THAT THEY'RE COMPENSATING SOMEONE FOR OR OR TAXIS DECLINING ANTEON SEES. INCREASING ABOUT THE AVERAGE IS STILL THE SAME. WELL I THINK THE PIE HAS GROWN I THINK THE STUDIES SHOW THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE USING MORE FOR HIGHER SERVICES AND- THERE BEEN MANY STUDIES ON THIS AND THERE'S EVEN A LOOK AT A PUBLIC TRANSIT AND IN MANY AREAS ACROSS THE COUNTRY PUBLIC TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IS DECLINING WHILE TNC TRIPS ARE GOING UP AND TYPICALLY OVER THE PAST. EIGHT TEN YEARS TAXI TRIPS HAVE BEEN DECLINING SO- BUT I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF WEIGHT AND DEMAND THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON RELATED TO THE VARIOUS TRIP LEVELS- IN ANOTHER POINT ON THE DATA NOT SURE IF THIS IS HELPFUL AS WELL BUT- THERE ARE- AGAIN THE STATE REQUIREMENTS AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS WE HAVE OUR CONGESTION MANAGEMENT AGENCIES CHARGED WITH TRACKING AND- IN. OF YOU KNOW TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE DECLINE IN ARE WE MEETING OUR GOALS AND- WITHOUT ANY TNC DATA THIS IS OUR FASTEST GROWING- TRANSPORTATION SECTOR FRANK AND-WITHOUT ANY DATA THE- THE CONGESTION MANAGEMENT AGENCIES ARE NOT ABLE TO EASILY ANSWER THOSE QESTIONS AND SO THEY'RE GOING OUT AND HAVING A SURVEY OR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WORK AROUND. HOW CAN WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE SECTOR AND YET THAT DATA IS BEING PROVIDED TO THE CPC IT'S JUST NOT A SHARED WITH OTHER PUBLIC AT. EASE. SO MUCH OF THE TOTAL ANOTHER EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT IT IF YOU WHEN YOU JUST DROP INTO THE SUBJECT AND YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THE BACKGROUND YOU KNOW I DID AS MUCH READING AS I COULD- BUT THE SO THAT'S REAL HELPFUL BUT MR MURRAY MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN. LA ACTS AGAIN- THE TNC IS HAD A WHALE OF A TIME LAST NIGHT ACCORDING TO. NEWS REPORTS AND SO YOU'RE MOVING THEM IN A YEAR YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT IN CONTROL OF THE AIRPORT BUT- BUT THEY'RE MAKING SOME MOVES THAT SEEMS TO BE FRUSTRATING A LOT OF. TRAVELERS SILAS SPECIALLY LAST NIGHT DID YOU ANY ANY FIVE COMMENTS. INTO THROUGH QUIPS REYES FOR MAKE SURE FOLKS ON THE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE SOME BREAKING NEWS IN REGARDS TO- THE CHALLENGES SO- SIMMERING AB PROCEED WITH THAT BUT JUST. AS WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THOSE LESSONS LEARNED FROM TEENSY RIGHT AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE SHIRT MOBILITY DEVICES PLEASE. CONTINUE. ON WITH THE ANSWER UP TO THE VICE YEAR THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU AND YOU'RE CORRECT- THE BILL A DOT THE AGENCY THAT I'M A PART OF WE DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER LA ACTS SO THAT MOVE WAS MADE. BY THE AIRPORT PROPER. BUT WHAT WE YOU HAVE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF TRIPS IS THAT OBVIOUSLY TEENS TEACHERS HAVE INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY IN THAT AREA. AND TAXI CHIPS- DECLINED TO A CERTAIN DEGREE- AT THE PEAK FOR TAXI TRIPS IS ABOUT ONE POINT SIX MILLION- ANNUALLY. AND NOW IT'S THE CLIENT OR POSSIBLY ONE POINT TWO MILLION- GIVE OR TAKE SO. WELL THE DECLINE HAS BEEN A RELATIVELY STEEP IT'S SOMEWHAT PLATEAU TO A CERTAIN DEGREE. BUT TNC TRIPS- ROSE EXPONENTIALLY SO TO KIND OF ANSWER YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTION I THINK WHAT KATE MENTION WAS THAT. THERE'S A BIGGER PIECE OF THE PIE NOW. AND THAT'S VERY MUCH TRUE SO. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF LA ACTS AGAIN. WE IN LOS ANGELES WE CAN MANAGER TAXICABS. SO THE CONGESTION LA ACTS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MISS. FROM TAXIS BECAUSE- WE ACTUALLY HAVE A RULE LA. WHERE TAXICABS CAN ONLY SERVICE THE AIRPORT ONE OUT OF THREE FIVE DAYS ONLY 20% OF OUR TO. CAP THE- NBA PLAYER. AT A GIVEN TIME. THAT IS SO IT'S NOT A SUPER COMPLICATED SYSTEM JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. OF IT. LET'S SAY THE DATE ON THE MONEY. WE'LL BE LIKE DAVE D. SCREEN. VEHICLE AND THEN THE LETTER AND THE NUMBERS THREE OR SIX CAN SERVICE THE AIRPORT TODAY ALL THE OTHER VEHICLES CANNOT. DO THAT TO MANAGE CONGESTION AT THE AIRPORT TO INSERT TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE. THREE HOUR WAIT FOR TAXI CAB SITTING AT OUR AIRPORT AND JUST WAITING THERE WE HAVE BUT WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE AN INFORMATION WERE ABLE TO DO THAT. WE DO NOT HAVE THAT AUTHORITY OVER TNC SO WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY TO BE ABLE TO SAY. HEY IT'S INCREDIBLY CROWDED. LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO. STYMIE SOME OF THAT CONGESTION WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF AUTHORITY CURRENTLY SO- THAT IS IT AN ISSUE FOR US AGAIN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. THANKS SO MUCH WITH MY CHILDREN GO TO CENTER BOUND IN THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN CENTER. ATTENDED A RECENT CONFERENCE WERE THE TALK ABOUT MICHAEL MOORE BILL THE AND THEY TALKED ABOUT THE- MIKE REMOTE MOBILITY. PRIVATE COMPANIES FORMING PARTNERSHIPS WITH PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES OTHER OTHER KINDS OF. A PUBLIC MOBILITY ORGANIZATIONS AND. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD IF THAT'S GOT USED DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A TREND IN THE FUTURE FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OR TRANSPORTATION GENERAL AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHEN WE- THEFEDERAL GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT GIVES GRANTS AND FUNDING TO- TRANSPORTATION. ONE OF THE STANDARD FOR NO NONSENSE REQUIREMENTS YOU HAVE TO OBSERVE THE CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS AMERICAN DISABILITY ACT. YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT YOUR- AFFIRMATIVE LEE AND FORCING OUT SO. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT- WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND IF SO. IN TERMS OF LOOKING AHEAD TO THE FUTURE. LIKE WE ARE WE SHOULD. HOW WILL THE- AMERICAN DISABILITY- ACTS- AND EQUAL ACCESS- EQUAL ACCESS TO ME MEANS LIKE NOT REDLINING BASED ON RACE CREED COLOR OTHER KINDS OF FACTORS. HOW CAN WE ENFORCE THE LAW. OF THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO ENFORCE WERE FIRMLY RESPONSIBLE FOR. CAN YOU CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT ISSUE PLEASE. SURE WELL IN TERMS OF THE BUSINESS MODELS IN THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS I THINK. I THINK THE JURY'S STILL OUT ON THAT IT'S SUCH A NEW INDUSTRY AND- AT THIS POINT I THINK THERE'S STILL A LOT OF SETTLING IN TO HAPPEN SO I'M NOT SURE I SEE A CLEAR PATH FOR THAT MAYBE MR MURRAY SEES MORE THAN I SEE THERE BUT I THINK THAT THE- THAT WE DON'T KNOW YET I THINK IT'S STILL EARLY ON- IN TERMS OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES. BILL IT HE'S ACT AND EQUAL ACCESS EQUITY THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US AND- THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR SCOOTER PERMIT PROGRAM AS IT STANDS NOW ON OUR BIKE SHARE PROGRAMS. THAT WE HAVE ADOPTIVE BIKESHARE REQUIREMENTS AND WE HAVE ADOPTED SCOOTER REQUIREMENTS- AND SO IT'S UP TO THE SCOOTER COMPANIES TO WORK WITH A DISABILITY COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE AND THAT THE- PART OF OUR KEEPING SCOOTERS IN THESE OTHER DEVICES OFFTHE SIDEWALKS IS TO KEEP THEM OUT OF THE ACCESSIBLE PATH OF TRAVEL TO MAKE SURE THAT. PEOPLE CAN GET TO WHERE THEY NEED TO GO TO SO THAT'S A PIECE OF IT AS WELL SO WE HAVE STRUCTURED PARKING GUIDELINES THAT WE WORK THROUGH WITH OUR DISABILITY COUNCIL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS GOING TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. MAN IF THEY RECEIVE PUBLIC FUNDS YOU KNOW SOME NOW. WHICH. HAPPEN YOU KNOW. HOW DO WE MANAGE THE. HE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF SOMEBODY TO HAVE EQUAL ACCESS AND NOT BE DISCOURAGED AGAINST BECAUSE OF THEIR DISABILITY I MEAN THAT'S- TWENTY KIND OF A. YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S NOT IT'S NOT RELATED TO OUR STATE LAWS IS TO SURVIVE. OVER ARCHING KIND OF REQUIREMENTS. AT ONE POINT I US THE ONE OF THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES AT A HEARING. WHAT ARE NOT. THEY OBSERVED THE DISABILITY RIGHTS ACT AND. THE EQUAL ACCESS PROVISIONS AND THEY SAID THEY DID. BUT I CONSTANTLY HEARING FROM PEOPLE. THAT THEY GET PASSED BY BY DRIVERS THAT THERE'S VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF KIND OF. DISCRIMINATION AND- TO ME IT MEANS OKAY WE SHOULD DEVELOP. SOMEWHERE WITH DEALING WITH THAT NOW HOW HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST WE DO THAT. IS THERE. SOME WAY WE CAN DO THAT OR WHAT WHAT ARE STEPS WE NEED TO TAKE. WELL WITH UP TO BRING IT BACK TO TAXIS AND THEN GO BACK TO THE MIKE REMOTE BILLION ARE TAXI PROGRAM WE'VE HAD TAXIS IS PART OF OUR PARA TRANSIT PROGRAM SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE. AND WE'VE HAD WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE TAXIS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR SO THIS IS A LONG STANDING COMMITMENT. OF THE MTA AND- AND IT'S DISABILITY ACCESS IS ONE OF OUR OVER ARCHING GUIDING PRINCIPLES AS AN AGENCY THAT'S A BOARD ADOPTED SET OF PRINCIPLES ON HOW TO ENGAGE WITH EMERGING MOBILITY COMPANIES. AND TO BRING IT BACK TO THE SCOOTERS THAT AGAIN PART OF OUR PERMIT CONDITIONS REQUIRE AN ADOPTIVE SCOOTER PROGRAM WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IS STILL YET TO BE DETERMINED PART OF THE JURY IS STILL OUT- IS THAT THERE'S- I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN EASY. VEHICLE TYPE THAT WE CAN POINT TO SAY THIS IS AN ACCESSIBLE SCOOTER BUT THE REQUIREMENT IS FOR THE SCOOTER COMPANIES TO WORK WITH THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY AND TRY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY WE ALSO HAVE AN ADOPTIVE. SHARE PROGRAM IN SAN FRANCISCO AS WELL AND WORKING TO. MEET THE NEEDS OF THE DISABILITY COMMUNITIES. SERVICE. THANK YOU AND I THINK AS A CITY. WE'RE ALWAYS OPEN TO ENGAGEMENT AND I THINK WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. AND ENERGY ENGAGING WITH OUR PRIVATE INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF TRYING TO MAKE THE CITY BETTER SO BUT YOU KNOW THE JURY'S OUT IN TERMS OF PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH HOW YOU'RE GOING TO AGREE. ON WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING BUT I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER IS SELF REGULATION. I THINK- WITH THE WAY THE- TNC SEVEN REGULATED CURRENTLY IT'S ESSENTIALLY SELF REGULATION AND I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH MICHAEL MOBILITY. IF THE ANSWER IF THE INTEL IF THE ANSWER IS THE TERM AND THAT WILL WILL ALLOW THEM TO SELF REGULATE AND JUST PROMISED US YOU'LL DO THE RIGHT THING. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S THE WAY TO GO I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE IMPORTANT- TO SAY THAT THERE'S A PARTNERSHIP. BETWEEN THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS WELL AS A PRIVATE ENTITIES AND FRANKLY EVEN A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE OR REGIONALLY THERE SHOULD BE SOME LOCAL. A JURISDICTIONAL CONTROL SO THAT THERE WE THE INPUT AND SAY IN WHAT HAPPENS. AS MANY OF THESE THINGS WILL AFFECT OUR CITIES. MOST WELCOME WE HIRE SOMEBODY TO DO ANYTHING IN THIS BUILDING OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT. THEY HAVE TO SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE ABOUT. THEIR REQUIREMENTS ABOUT. YOU KNOW CIVIL RIGHTS AND AMERICAN DISABILITY ACT THEY HAVE TO SIGN. THEY'RE GONNA FOLLOW THOSE LAWS. AND I INSIST. THAT THAT BE DONE. IT HAS TO BE DONE YOU CAN'T IGNORE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF SOMEBODY. THE AMERICAN DISABILITIES ACT AS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. IT THERE'S NO LAW THAT I CAN IMAGINE THE STATE WOULD PASS THAT WOULD SUPERSEDE AMERICAN DISABILITY ARE. I THANK THE CHAIR FRAZIER AYE BOTH TO GO ALONG CONCURRENT ON THE SUBJECT. SO WE MUST BE HERE WE HAVE TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT. A WAY WERE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. ON THESE KINDS OF TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS THAT THAT QUESTION IS ADDRESSED IN APPROPRIATE MANNER WITH THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE PEOPLE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SUBJECT. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER BY WITH A TO BE ABLE TO KEEP MOVING HERE THAT TO TURN OVER A TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN. SOMEONE FRIEDMAN JUST VERY QUICKLY SO- LAST YEAR I DID A BILL IS USEFUL FOR SUMMIT I WANT TO COMMEND BOTH OF YOU FOR BEING HERE BUT ALSO FOR BEING FROM CITIES BETTER TAKING THESE QUESTIONS VERY SERIOUSLY AND REALLY WORKING ON THE FOREFRONT OF MAKING POLICIES AROUND TNC IS AND MICROBIOLOGY ARE YOU BOTH OR- YOU KNOW REPRESENTING CITIES AND INVOLVED IN WORK THAT IS GOING TO SET THE STAGE FOR WHAT COMES NEXT FOR A LOT OF OTHER CITIES AND FOR THE STATE'S OF THANK YOU FOR. BRINGING THAT THOUGHTFULNESS SIDE TO THE HEARING TODAY AND FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCES IT'S VERY HELPFUL JUST A FEW QUICK COMMENTS- LAST YEAR I DID A BILL- AB ELEVEN FORTY TWO THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE CITIES OF THE RIGHT TO COLLECT ALL THE DATA THAT YOU DESPERATELY NEED ABOUT TEN SEIZE AND IT DID MAKE IT TO THE ASSEMBLY IT WAS A SHAME THAT THE BILL ENDED UP DYING INONE OF OUR COMMITTEES ON THE SENATE SIDE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO PROVIDE CITIES WITH THAT INFORMATION AND- YOU KNOW WE HAD A VEHICLE TO ALLOW THAT AND IT DIDN'T GET THROUGH AND THEIR STOCK NOW TRYING TO PLAN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TRYING TO. PLAN LA ACTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE WITHOUT HAVING THE DATA THAT THEY NEED TO INTEGRATE THOSE SOLUTIONS IN WITH THEIR CITY AND TO DO THE BASIC KIND OF REGULATION SO I COMMIT TO KEEP WORKING TO TRY TO GET YOU THAT INFORMATION- BUT YOU KNOW ALL CERTAINLY NEED YOU TO HELP GET SUPPORT TO GET THIS TO THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE TNC USE THAT ARE VERY NERVOUS ABOUT YOU KNOW ALLOWING THAT INFORMATION TO BE. PROVIDED AND I THINK THAT PEAS. YOU SEE REALLY NEEDS ARE. TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THIS IS YOU KNOW IMPORTANT INFORMATION. BUT NOW TO SAY IN TERMS OF YOUR WAS INTERESTED IN HEARING YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT CABS IN HEARING SO MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF TRADITIONAL CABS AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. YOU KNOW THE CAP CERTAINLY DO A LOT OF BENEFITS AND THEY'RE EASIER FOR CITIES TO REGULATE BUT THE REASON THAT CABS ARE ARE NOT THE PREFERRED MODE OF TRAVEL IS VERY OBVIOUS TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TAKEN CABS AND TAKEN. RIDE SHARES THE LAST TIME I TOOK A CAB IN LOS ANGELES WAS MANY YEARS AGO AND I REMEMBER HAVING TO TRAVEL JUST A COUPLE MILES AND TAKING A CAB BECAUSE I YOU KNOW HAD BAGS OR SOMETHING AND I THINK THAT TWO MILE TRIP COST ME ABOUT EIGHTY DOLLARS- YOU KNOW THIS WAS BACK BEFORE- UBER AND LIFT WERE THERE TO DO THAT COMPETITION AND- OF BEING IN A- THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN A CAB COMPARED TO BEING IN MOST RIDE CHER VEHICLES IS PROFOUND. AND IN TERMS OF REDLINING I WHEN I USED TO LIVE IN BED STUY IN BROOKLYN BELIEVE ME THERE'S A LOT OF REDLINING IN NEW YORK- EVEN WITH THEIR HIGHLY REGULATED A CAB COMPANIES ANYWAY TO TRY TO GET A CAB FROM MANHATTAN TO BROOKLYN- LATE AT NIGHT KNOWS THAT IT'S ALL KINDS OF REDLINING THAT GOES ON ITS RACIAL AND JUST IN TERMS TO YOU. AUGUST THIS BILL. YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE DONE. BUT TO THEM WHEN PEOPLE USE THEIR POCKETBOOKS TO SHOW THAT THEY NEED A METHOD OF TRANSPORTATION THAT IS SEAT THAT THEY FEEL SAFE THAT'S CONVENIENT AND THAT'S AFFORDABLE FOR THEM THAT'S WHEN WE START SEEING YOUNG PEOPLE DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WANTING TO DO FOR A LONG TIME WHICH IS SAY I DON'T NEED TO HAVE A CAR. AT EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY ONE THAT NOW I'M GONNA ACTUALLY TRUST USING TNC IS PLUS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND WE HAVE THIS REALLY GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY WITH THIS GENERATION TO HARNESS THAT- BUT ONLY IF WE ALLOW THE WITH. THE. ASPECTS OF THAT TRANSPORTATION MODALITY THAT'S SO ATTRACTIVE TO THEM TO CONTINUE AND NOT TO TRY TO SET UP A PARADIGM TO GO YOU KNOW TO MOVE THAT BACK. TO GET THOSE THINGS THAT WE HAD WITH CABS THAT ACTUALLY WAS CAUSING THEM TO BE OUT OF UNAFFORDABLE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE NOT CONVENIENT AND CERTAINLY NOT PLEASANT- SO YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST SOMETHING WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND AND YOU KNOW I GUESS I COULD SAY THIS AT THE END BUT I'LL SAY IT NOW. YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S WITH MICROBIOLOGY WAS SCOOTERS THAT WE PUT ON THE BACKS OF THE SCOOTERS THINGS LIKE SAFETY. REALLY SHOULDN'T BE ON THEM AND YES THEY SHOULD HAVE A SAFE A SAFER VEHICLES POSSIBLE AND IT'S GREAT WHEN THEY HAVE THE THREE WHEELED VEHICLES THAT MORE SENIORS CAN RIDE AND YOU KNOW I THINK THEY'LL GET THERE. BUT A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE OR ISSUES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH OUR PLANNING ARE PLANNING FROM A CITY LEVEL BUT AS PRIORITIZE AUTOMOBILES OVERALL ELSE AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT MOVES INTO THAT SPACE IS AT RISK. BECAUSE THOSE SCOOTERS SCOOTERS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE LIGHTER THAN A CAR THE SAME WAY THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE PEDESTRIANS KILLED EVERY SINGLE DAY ACROSS THE STATE AND TO. TURN OF THE HIGH. COST. IS BEING RUN OVER BY CARS BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT. WHEN STUDENTS COME WE HAVE. WE JUST HEARD. COLLISIONS THAT ARE IN THE SINGLE DIGITS. AND EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT HOW DANGEROUS THEY ARE WELL I'M SORRY I'M A LOT MORE FREE FOR MY SIX YEAR OLD. ABOUT HER ENCOUNTERING THE CAR THEN ENCOUNTERING A SCOOTER SO. WORRIED ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE ENGINEERING ISSUES THAT WE SHOULD DO IN TERMS OF OUR CITIES TO MAKE OUR ROADS SAFER. AND MAKE IT SAFER FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO USE- BUT THE MESSAGE OF TRANSPORTATION THAT ARE GOING TO BE YEAH WE CAN DEAL WITH THE PICKUPS AND MAKE THAT GREENER AND ALL OF THAT. BUT WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF CARS IN OUR CITIES. NEW BOTH KNOW THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE FROM CITIES THAT ARE. IMPACTED BY THAT. BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER. AND OUR QUESTION SHOULD BE HOW DO WE ENGINEER OUR STREETS TO MAKE THEM SAFER FOR MICROBIOLOGY. AND NOT HOW DO WE MAKE MY CHROME MOBILITY. FIT INTO THIS PARADIGM WHERE IT HAS TO BE THEM VERSUS A CAR. OR THEM VERSUS A PEDESTRIAN YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF ON US. AS PEOPLE WHO ENGINEER CITIES. SO JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE IS WHERE I'M COMING FROM. AND YOU KNOW CONTINUE I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THE- DATE IT. SORRY TO SEE THAT BILL NOT MAKE IT TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL. WORK ON THAT TOGETHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS THE MEMBER AND I THINK THAT'S WHY- GRATEFUL FOR THE- BOTH ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. FRIEDMAN MURATSUCHI FOR THEIR WORK. BOTH ON- FOLKS IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SIDE. ON THE DATING. SITE THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY FIRST OF TO- HEARINGS WERE WALKING BE FOCUSED. ON HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO BE TO MOVE FORWARD. HERE AND TWENTY TWENTY. IF IT'S OKAY WITH COMMITTEE I TO TURN OVER TO THE CHAIR- TO BE ABLE TO GIVE A FINAL WORD ON THIS PANEL THAT WORKS. MISTER MISTER DID YOU HAVE ANY ITEMS. RUBIO SCHEDULE ANY. SORT OF A CHAIR AND THEN I'LL TURN OVER THE NEXT PANEL FOR YOU MISTER- I JUST WANTED TO ADD ON TO. WHAT SENATOR BILL IT CAPTURED. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT IN THE EIGHTY EIGHT- AND I HEARD. EIGHTY A MOVEMENT TOWARDS. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. OF ZERO EMISSION EVEY. I WOULD HOPE THAT WE- ABSOLUTELY. MAKE A COMMITMENT FIRST AS IT'S AN HONOR SOME COSTLY. ENDEAVOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- RIGHT. WRITING BUT I RIDER CAPACITY. WITH DISABILITY- COMPS. COMPONENTS BE ADDRESSED. BEFORE WE EVEN. TRIED TO MOVE INTO THE V. I UNDERSTAND A PARALLEL PATH BUT IF WE'RE- TRYING TO GO EQUALLY COURSE WE'RE JACK'S WE SHORT CHANGING. OF THE ABILITY TO END RIGHT CHAIR TO MAKE SURE. THAT EVERYBODY HAS AN ABILITY BECAUSE OF THEIR DISABILITY TO BE ABLE TO. TO GET SOMEWHERE- AND AGAIN I UNDERSTAND AND I COMPLETELY APPLIED EVERY EFFORT FOR ZERO MISSION CAPABILITY. BUT NOT AT THE COST OF SOMEBODY WHO HAS A DISABILITY I WANT GOING TO JUST MAKE SURE HAT. THAT I'M HEARD. A AS THE CHURCH TRANSPORTATION THAT EVERY EFFORT IS MADE. IN THAT IN THAT WORLD BECAUSE IT IS NOT. THEN THERE WILL BE LEGISLATION THAT MAKES YOU STOP AND CAPTURE UP WHAT YOU NEED TO ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS OF YOUR POPULATION ON SITE I WANTED TO BE IDENTIFIED BECAUSE IT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME AND SENATOR BELL ON MAKING SURE THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL IS HIS. NEEDS ARE. TAKING CARE OF. GREAT. THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE TRIP HERE BOTH THE YOUR INSIGHT WAS VALUABLE AND- UNBELIEVABLY HELPFUL TO THIS COMMITTEE AND- WE WILL HOPE THAT THE CPU SEE WILL BE A BETTER PARTNER WITH DATA SHARING COMING FOR DINNER WE'VE HEARING THROUGH- THIS COMMITTEE THAT- THAT'S A POSSIBILITY COMING FORWARD WITH THE WILLINGNESS SO. THANK YOU HM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OF THE REGULATORY LANDSCAPE FOR SURE MOBILITY DEVICES NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE EXPLORING CHALLENGES A LOCAL REGULATORY PRACTICES WE HAVE SO LITTLE RENT RENTALS THE GENERAL MANAGER OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION FRANCIE STEPHAN ACTING TAKE CHIEF MOBILITY OFFICER AND ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF PLANNING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CITY OF SANTA MONICA. TOM ACQUIRE A NO RELATION TO OUR CHAIR IN TERM DIRECTOR OF TRANSPORTATION SERVICES COMMUNITY MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY A JENNIFER DUNN ONE- WYANT A TRANSPORTATION PLANNING DIRECTOR CITY OF SACRAMENTO AND KEVIN AFTER A SO SHE TRANSPORTATION SPECIAL CITY OF SAN JOSE DEPARTMENT OF. TRANSPORTATION THANK YOU ONE AND ALL FOR COMING. MAYBE YOU DRAW STRAWS TO SEE WHO WOULD BE FIRST BUT- LET'S JUST GO LEFT TO RIGHT IN. AND WE'LL GO FROM THAT. WHEN I GO TO THAT PRESENTATION. ARE YOU DEAD. TECHNOLOGY. AS THEY'RE WORKING ON IT WILL JUST START AT THE TOP OF THE COLUMN- SWEATER RENTALS GENERAL MANAGER WOULD YOU PLEASE GIVE US A YOU'RE A FOCUS SURE- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY I'M SO LEADER RENTALS ON THE GENERAL MANAGER FOR LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION- I'M ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CITY TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS- AND- THE CHAIR OF THE UP IN MOBILITY FOUNDATION- SO I'M HERE BECAUSE I'VE SPENT THE LAST TWENTY PLUS YEARS OF MY CAREER WORKING ON MAKING CITIES AND STREETS SAFER FOR PEOPLE WHO WALK AND BIKE- AND REALLY NO MATTER HOW THEY GET AROUND. AND BUT THAT HAS REMAINED A STUBBORN CHALLENGE- PARTICULARLY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES OVER HALF OF THE TRIPS THAT HAPPEN IN THE CITY ON THE SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED MILES OF STREETS THAT WE MANAGE AND OPERATE ARE UNDER THREE MILES BUT 71% OF THEM ARE PEOPLE DRIVING THEMSELVES ALONE IN THEIR CARS AND SO YOU KNOW WE MAKE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS IN GIVING PEOPLE CHOICES AND IN TRYING TO CREATE. A DIFFERENT KIND OF CITY- BUT WHEN SCOOTER SHOWED UP ON OUR STREETS ALMOST OVERNIGHT. FOR THE SHORT TRIPS AND SO WE TOOK IT UNDER IN OUR INTEREST TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE COMPANIES COULD SUCCEED BECAUSE IN THE VERY VERY BEST VERSION OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ROLES- CITIES ARE MANAGING STREETS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE BRINGING NEW OPTIONS AND ARE INNOVATING AND OUR ITERATING AND ARE SUCCEEDING SO WE HAD A SERIES OF PUBLIC HEARINGS- WE HAD COMMITTEE THAT COMMUNITY MEETINGS TO COME UP WITH A SET OF COMMON SENSE REGULATIONS- TO SORT OF SET THE STAGE ON THE POSITIVE SIDE WE NOW HAVE THE LARGEST SCOOTER PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY IF NOT THE WORLD WE HAVE THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND SCOOTERS- ON THE STREET OF LOS ANGELES WE ARE ON TRACK. TO HAVE NINETEEN MILLION TRIPS HAPPENED BY SCOOTERS AND BIKES IN A SINGLE YEAR AND THE MAJORITY OF THOSE TRIPS ARE EXACTLY THE ONES THAT WE WERE TRYING TO GIVE PEOPLE CHOICES THAT WORK FOR THEIR BETWEEN HALF A MILE AND TWO MILES OR TALKING ABOUT NEIGHBORHOOD TRIPS WERE TALKING ABOUT TRIPS TO GO TO HAVE LUNCH WITH YOUR FRIEND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRIPS TO GET TO YOUR HOUSE FROM THE TRANSIT STATION- ON THE NOT SO GREAT SIDE WE WERE SEEING THAT COMPANIES WERE AKING A REALLY LONG TIME TO RESPOND TO COMMUNITY COMPLAINTS. SOMETIMES UPWARDS OF TWENTY HOURS TO COME AND COLLECT THEIR SCOOTERS WHEN THEY ENDED UP WHERE THEY WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE WHETHER IT WAS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREA LIKE THE VENICE CANALS OR REALLY CROWDED SIDEWALKS- ON THE WEST SIDE OF LOS ANGELES WE WERE ALSO SEEING THAT THESE COMPANIES WERE NOT SERVING THE CITY EQUITABLY SO THEY WERE TARGETING A LOT OF THE HIGHER INCOME DENSER NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CITY WHERE PEOPLE ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES ON HOW TO GET AROUND AND THEY WERE NOT GOING TO LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY IN BOYLE HEIGHTS IN WHAT'S PLACES WHERE PEOPLE DESPERATELY NEED. SERVE ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION TO EXPAND THEIR ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY- AND WE WERE JUST SORT OF SEEING THAT- THEY WERE ENDING UP OVER DEPLOYING IN PLACES WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T SO FOR EXAMPLE IN A ONE SQUARE MILE AREA IN VENICE THERE WERE OVER TWO THOUSAND SCOOTERS AND BIKES. DEPLOYED IN THE SAME SORT OF ONE SQUARE MILE AREA. SO BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO SET REGULATIONS AND GET INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THE COMPANIES WERE DEPLOYING WE WERE ABLE TO PUT WHAT'S CALLED A GEO FENCE AROUND THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. MEASURE EXACTLY HOW MUCH SPACE THERE WAS ON THE SIDEWALK TO SAFELY STORE THE VEHICLES. AND THEN GIVE EACH COMPANY AND A LOT OF BUDGET FOR THE NUMBER OF SCOOTERS AND BIKES THAT THEY COULD HAVE IN THAT ARENA. AND THEN ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS WE WERE ABLE TO SEE WHO WAS OBEYING THE RULES. AND WHO WAS NOT AND IF SOMEBODY WASN'T OBEYING THE RULES WE WERE ABLE TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. AND IN SO DOING WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD PUBLIC TRUST AND CONFIDENCE. THAT THESE KINDS OF NEW IDEAS AND NEW CHOICES COULD COME INTO THE CITY IN A WAY. THAT THE CITY CAN HANDLE. SO THE WAY WE DO THAT IS WE COLLECT AS LITTLE INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE WE ONLY GET ABOUT SIX PIECES OF DATA FROM THESE COMPANIES. THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES COLLECT OVER TWO DOZEN PIECES OF DATA- ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THEIR SYSTEMS AND ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING AND WHEN AND WHY- WE HAVE PRIVACY PRINCIPLES THAT WE PUT FORWARD FOR PUBLIC COMMENT- THAT REALLY. PUT US IN A VERY STERN BOX ON MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING PEOPLE'S INFORMATION. THAT WE ARE NEVER MONETIZING ITAND THAT WE'RE STORING IT FOR A SHORTER PERIOD AS POSSIBLE- AND WE'RE DOING IT TRANSPARENTLY ARE OPEN PLATFORM. OPERATION WITH MANY OF THE COMPANIES THAT OPERATE IN LOS ANGELES. SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE IN TERMS OF STATEWIDE REGULATION. THERE IS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL VACUUM WHEN IT COMES TO REGULATING THE VEHICLES THEMSELVES. AND WHAT WE SEE IS COMPANIES DOING A LOT OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH NEW KINDS OF VEHICLES. THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. AND THEN CITIES SORT OF AT A LOSS ABOUT HOW TO REGULATE THEM OR WHAT CATEGORIES THEY FALL INTO. THE SECOND ARENA THAT WE THINK IS REALLY. IMPORTANT AND VALUABLE FOR THE STATE TO REGULATE IS AROUND INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS- WE DO THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE STATE HAS TRADITIONALLY DONE AND DONE A GOOD JOB OF- AND THAT WOULD BE GREAT FOR THAT FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO- MAYBE I'LL WERE STILL. ARE WE STILL HOW WE'RE STILL SPENDING TIME GOT IT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TOM WHERE. A GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS TOM ACQUIRE AN INTERPRETER OF THE SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY AND IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE TODAY TO SHARE SOME OF SAN FRANCISCO'S EXPERIENCE. WITH ROLLING OUT A VARIETY OF SURE MOBILITY OPTIONS ESPECIALLY THE SCOOTERS. I'D SERVICES SCHOOL AS MY COLLEAGUE HE TOWARDS THAT WE SHARE MANY THE STATE'S AMBITIOUS GOALS AROUND VIçT T. REDUCTION GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. AT A SAFETY AND AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF TRANSPORTATION OPPORTUNITIES. IT'S BEEN GREAT TO BE ABLE TO LET THOSE PRINCIPLES PLAY OUT IN A REGULATION OF SHARED MOBILITY- WE'VE ALSO- IN AN EFFORT TO SIGNAL TO PRIVATE INDUSTRY WHICH IS CONSTANTLY INNOVATING ON THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO- WHAT OUR GOALS ARE FOR THE SYSTEM. WE PUBLISHED A SERIES OF UP GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THE ROLLOUT OF SHARED MOBILITY AND IT COVERS MANY OF THE SAME KINDS OF POLICY PRINCIPLES THAT ARE OF INTEREST TO THE STATE. LIKE CONGESTION REDUCTION SAFETY AND EQUITY. I WOULD WITH A- AN INTERESTING TRACK RECORD OF- THAT SENIOR DIVISION ON OUR STREETS- AND I THINK WE'VE- BEEN ABLE TO. LEARN THE LESSONS THAT WE THAT WE DISCUSSED THE PREVIOUS TITLES IN THE TNC EASE AT TRY TO APPLY. A LITTLE MORE ROBUST REGULATORY APPROACH- THAT IS- THAT THAT IS POLICY FORWARD- AND THE RESULT OF THAT HAS BEEN A WIDE VARIETY OF CHOICES THAT SAN FRANCISCANS HAVE TO USE YOUR MOBILITY. WE HAVE FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOCKED SHARED BIKES WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED DOCTOR USES BIKES WE HAVE CURRENTLY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED E. SCOOTERS. AS WELL AS PROGRAMS FOR A STREETCAR SHARE- ST SHARED ELECTRIC MOPEDS AND PRIVATE COMMUTER SHUTTLE BUSES SO WE HAVE A LOT OF PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS SERVICES GO- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN THIS WHEN THREE SCOOTER COMPANY SHOWED UP IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND WITH NOTED NOTIFICATION OF PERMISSION FROM THE CITY DROPPED OVER TWO THOUSAND SCOOTERS ARE SIDEWALKS. WE HAD A WILD WEST CONDITIONS SOMETHING THAT. WASN'T ACCEPTABLE TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS OR TWO WERE TO US THAT THE MTA. HI WE MOVE QUICKLY. TO ESTABLISH REGULATORY PROGRAM THAT. THAT WAS MADE TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS THAT SCOOTERS WILL BRING TO SAN FRANCISCO BUT ALSO AND HARNESS THE BENEFITS THAT THEY COULD BRING BEES WE KNOW AS SO MANY SPEAKERS OF SAID TODAY. THAT OUR CITIES ARE ARE DROUGHT WE'RE DROWNING IN TRAFFIC CONGESTION WE HAVE TO FIND ALTERNATIVES TO THE CAR. WITH NO SCOOTERS TO PLAY THAT ROLE IF THE REGULATED PROPERLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND THE SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT WE NEEDED TO USE REGULATIONS TO MANAGE WERE. RIDING ON THE SIDEWALKS AND PARKING ILLEGALLY ESPECIALLY IN WAYS THAT BLOCK CROSSWALK SIDEWALKS AND CURB RAMPS. AND WE'RE WE'RE PLEASED TO SAY THAT WE WENT FROM A SITUATION IN TWENTY EIGHT IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WE HAD NO REGULATIONS WERE GETTING AS MANY AS TWO THOUSAND THREE ONE ONE COMPLAINTS A MONTH. AND IN TOWN AS MANY AS FIVE HUNDRED SCOOTERS PROMOTE FROM OUR OUR SIDEWALKS- TO US A SYSTEM THAT IS MUCH MORE ACCEPTABLE TO OUR RESIDENTS. AND STARTING WILL START TO SEE SOME OF THOSE REALLY POSITIVE BENEFITS FROM HAVING. SCOOTERS AS PART OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. SO SOME OF THE KEY CONCLUSIONS THAT THAT WE'VE COME TO INSPECT KEY OBSERVATIONS THAT I THINK APPLICABLE- STATEWIDE OR- PERSONAL IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE THE ABILITY. TO ADDRESS THEIR OWN UNIQUE CHALLENGES SO SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE VERY NARROW SIDEWALKS WE HAVE HEAVY Là HIGH LEVELS OF PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC WE HAVE A LOT OF TRUCK TRAFFIC CONGESTION. THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO SAN FRANCISCO AND A STATEWIDE pPOLICY WOULD NOT HELP US ADDRESS THOSE. THOSE ISSUES ARE FOR CISCO. SECONDLY WE'VE SEEN REGULATION DRIVING SOME POSITIVE TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE ONE OF THE OUTCOMES OF OUR REGULATIONS IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH IT EVERY TOUR OPERATOR IS NOW DEPLOYING A LOCK TO MECHANISM. SO YOU CAN USE A SCOOTER SCARE SHARES COULD READ SAN FRANCISCO UNLESS YOU LOCK IT UP TO A BIKE RACK OR SOME OTHER SORT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE END OF YOUR TRIP. AND THAT IS DONE WONDERS FOR REDUCING ATTIC CONGESTION OUR SIDEWALKS AND THAT INNOVATION WOULD OUT OF HAPPENED IT NOT BEEN FOR A REGULATORY APPROACH. TIED. TO OUR LOCAL OUR OUR LOCAL TRANSPORTATION ISSUES. SO THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IT EVOLVING INDUSTRY. SO WHEN WE- FIRST PUT OUT A CALL FOR. APPLICATIONS FOR WAS THE TIME A PERMIT FOR UPPER THEIR PILOT PROGRAM IN TWENTY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH TWELVE APPLICANTS. MANY OF THE APPLICANTS ARE ALREADY BEEN IN BUSINESS THROUGH MERGERS ACQUISITIONS AND- ADDRESS THE NATIONAL TURN OF TECH COMPANIES- WE KNOW THAT- THE- PLAYERS IN THE FIELD ARE COSTLY CHANGING. WE KNOW SOME OF THE EARLY PARTICIPANTS HAD A HARD TIME TO PULLING THEIR SCOOTERS EQUITABLY ACROSS THE CITY. WE KNOW THAT OUR TIME EVEN MAINTAINING THE FLEET SIZE THEY PROMISE EMPHASIS IS THEY WOULD DEPLOY IS ONE WHICH YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THE MINUTE. OKAY JUST ABOUT DONE THANKS. AND THAT'S WHY- DIED DUE TO SHERRY SUPPORT AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRY EVOLVES WE NEED TO HAVE SOME TRANSPARENCY TO THE PUBLIC THAT. WE ARE. KEEPING TRACK OF THE DISTRIBUTION ISSUES AND KEEPING TRACK. OF THE OVERALL FLEET SIZE. AND FINALLY I WOULD I WOULD ABSOLUTELY HOLE OR THE ACT- ECHO ITS LEADERS SAID- THERE'S A CLEAR ROLE FOR THE STATE. AND HELPING REGULATE SAFETY OF THE PRODUCT THAT'S ON THE STREET. AND HELPING SET THE MINIMUM. I INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE THAT ARE- RECORDABLE THESE PROVIDERS EVERYTHING'S THERE MUST BETTER DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE CITY LEVEL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE EXPERIENCE THANK YOU FRIENDS HE WILL GO AHEAD AND GO WITH YOU AND- AND WAS GET BACK IN LINE. THREE TWENTY THANK YOU THANK YOU A PRETTY STEP IN CITY SANTA MONICA CHIEF ABILITY OFFICER- I WON'T REPEAT THE- GREAT COMMENTS FROM. MY COLLEAGUES- I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT THEY'VE SAID TO DATE- SO FAR BUT ABOUT OF THE PRIMARY ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. IN SANTA MONICA I WILL I WOULD THINK I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE- THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY LOCAL RULES THAT THAT THE COMMUNITY AND CONSERVANCY TURNED TO US TO ADDRESS AND THAT IS PRIMARILY DATED A PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY MANAGEMENT- IN ADDITION TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN SERVICE TO THE POINT THAT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO BUILD OUR STREETS FOR SAFETY. WE ALSO HAVE AN UP WE ARE THE COMMUNITY EARNS TO US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAINTAINING SAFETY IN ORDER IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. AND THE SCOOTERS HAVE PROVIDED- WONDERFUL MOBILITY OPTION- IN SANTA MONICA OR IS WRAPPING UP. A PILOT PROGRAM IN. OVER THIRTEEN MONTHS WE'VE HAD TWO POINT SIX MILLION TRIPS. A. ON THE FOR OPERATORS. IN THE CITY THAT'S INCREDIBLE- IT'S REDUCE A LOT OF A COLD STARTS EMISSIONS AND DEALT WITH SOME REAL. FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES WE HAVE WITH PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET AROUND TOWN. HOWEVER WE ALSO HAVE THOUSANDS OF INCIDENTS OF A SIDEWALK BLOCKAGES AND IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY POSSIBLE FOR A CITY EVEN AS SMALL AS HOURS OF EIGHT SQUARE MILES. TO BE ON EVERY STREET CORNER AT ALL TIMES MANAGING THREE THOUSAND VEHICLES THAT MOVE ALL THE TIME. IT'S JUST NOT REALISTIC FOR US TO BE OUT THERE LOOKING FOR THEM COUNTING THEM FINDING THESE PROBLEMS AND FOR US TO MAINTAIN ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE NEED TECHNOLOGY TOOLS AND WE NEED A TRUE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE WITH THE COMPANIES. TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO DO THEIR PART. THESE DEVICES ARE NOT CARS SO THEY ARE NOT AS VALUABLE THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE LEFT. THROWN DESTROYED. VANDALIZED AND SO WE NEED. UP TRUE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND THE COMPANIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE- THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR PART TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR ASSETS ARE BEING MAINTAINED. AND ALSO DEALT WITH IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY SO I WANT TO JUST UNDERSCORE THAT IS A IS A REALLY FUNDAMENTAL TO THIS- ROLE THAT WE ALL. THAT WE ALL PLAY- I ALSO WANT TO. SAY THAT YOU KNOW IS THE CITY WE CONVENE FOURTEEN LEADING CITIES FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. LAST MONTH TO SURVEY BEST PRACTICES. AS WE'RE EMBARKING ON OUR NEXT PILOT PROGRAM AND IT'S QUITE TRUE THAT THERE ARE SOME BEST PRACTICES BUT THERE'S NO DOMINANT MODEL AT THIS POINT. AND GIVEN THAT THE INDUSTRY IS NOT YET. DEMONSTRATING A- FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY. THEY NEED TO MAKE CHANGES TO MEET THEIR BOTTOM LINE JUST LIKE CITIES HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES TO MEET OUR MINIMUM SAFETY REQUIREMENTS SO WE EXPECT THAT THAT COME. WILL NEED TO CHANGE AND THAT'S OKAY- NOBODY'S LOOK MUCH BEYOND EIGHT. TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AT THIS POINT FROM A REGULATORY STANDPOINT BECAUSE WE'VE NO. THIS WILL CHANGE THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE DOING SECOND THIRD PILOT PROGRAM THIS IS. GOOD YOU'RE SICK TO BE ARE WE BUT RATHER MORE STE. BUT THAT'S THE NET THAT'S TRUE THE STE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT MAILING THINGS DOWN TOO SOON WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE A WAVE FOR THE ABILITY FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY AND PROBLEM SOLVE. SO WITHOUT REPEATING ANYTHING OTHERS IS SET ON CLOSER LOOK FOR TO A CONVERSATION QUESTIONS. THAT WILL. MOVE ON TO A JENNIFER DUNN POINT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JENNIFER DOMINO I AND I AM THE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO WE ARE HONORED AND EXCITED TO BE AT THE TABLE AND MEETING BEFORE YOU TODAY- WE ADOPTED A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ABOUT A IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR- AND HAVE SINCE THEN BROUGHT IN FOR COMPANIES OPERATE IN OUR CITY- WE HAD ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND TRIPS IN THAT TIME WERE IN ABOUT A YEAR PROCESS BECAUSE JOHN WAS HE ABOUT HERE ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE HAND- WE DEVELOPED OUR REGULATIONS ARE ON BEST PRACTICES FOR THAT WAS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE US. AND ALSO LESSONS LEARNED BECAUSE WE WERE A LITTLE BIT LATER THAN OTHER CITIES TO SEE- MICRO ABILITY WHETHER IT BE- BIKES SCOOTERS OR- WE'RE GONNA MOPEDS SOON AND WHATEVER ELSE THE FUTURE MAY BRING. LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET THIS TO WORK GREAT- SO WE DEVELOPED A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK- DOING A LOT OF LOCAL INPUT SO IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO US THAT NOT ONLY DO WE RELY ON BEST PRACTICES AND LESSONS LEARNED. BUT THAT WE HEARD FROM OUR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES OBVIOUSLY WE LISTEN TO YOU ARE WALKING BIKING COMMUNITIES. AND WE ALSO WORKS THE BUSINESS GROUPS HER BEEN INCREDIBLE CHAMPIONS FOR A COMPLETE STREETS IN VISITOR TRAFFIC SAFETY WORK- AND THEIR INPUT RANGE FROM A WE LOVE THEM BRING THEM TO WITH. APPREHENSION AND A LITTLE BIT OF ANXIETY- WE ALSO WORKED WITH A DISABILITIES ADVISORY COMMISSION WHO HAD AND CONTINUE TO HAVE. ISSUES AND CHALLENGES WERE BOUGHT PASS A TRAVEL. AND THEN WE WERE THERE NEIGHBORHOODS SO YOU ARE RELATIVELY LOCAL YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN OUR FAIR CITY. YOU'RE PROBABLY VERY FAMILIAR WITH OUR GREAT AND- WHERE WE HAVE A LOT F DIFFERENT TYPES OF NEIGHBORHOODS BUT YOU GO FURTHER OUT. WE HAVE OUR STREETCAR SUBURBS THAN A MORE SUBURBAN. NEIGHBORHOODS THE ALL HAVE VERY DIFFERENT INTERESTS AND WANTED US TO ADDRESS EACH OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS DIFFERENTLY. SO CHALLENGES- I'M SURE THAT YOU'RE WHERE THE CHALLENGES HERE IN SACRAMENTO AS WELL AS YOUR HOME CITIES IF YOU HAVE THESE DEVICES THERE- BUT WELL YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW IS THE STRAIN THAT HAS HAD ON STAFF RESOURCES. WE ARE A SMALL CITY OUR HOME IT'S A CITY WITH A SMALL BUDGET. OUT AND WE'RE STILL FUNDED DEPARTMENTS AND SO THIS IS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE STRAIN ON STAFF RESOURCES MY TEAM IT NORMALLY DOES TRANSPORTATION PLANNING. IS NOW DEALING WITH A LOT OF ISSUES THAT COME THROUGH DEALING WITH. OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED CALLS MAYBE NOT AS MANY AS ARE PURE CITIES HEREWE ARE BUT SMALLER. BUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED CALLS. ON APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED HAVE TO DEAL WITH BLOCKED ASSESSABLE PASSIVE TRAVEL. AND THAT'S SIGNIFICANT WE TAKE EIGHTY EIGHT SS ABILITY VERY SERIOUSLY. AND BLOCK HAS A TRAVEL OR SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FOR US- WE REQUIRE THAT THE SHARED RIDE IT WILL E PARTY CALL INSURED VITALS- WHETHER IT'S BIKES SCOOTERS WHATEVER IT MAY BE. GLOBAL TERM BE PARKED. AT A BIKE RACK OR CITY TO CITY DOES NEED TO DROP SOME. LET'S NOT HAPPENING OBVIOUSLY- IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR US WE'VE DONE A LOT OF OUT REACH. OUT THROUGH- FUN VIDEOS THAT YOU MIGHT SEE OF ME AND OUT TAKES TO WORKING WITH OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND PARTNERING WITH C. H. P. PARTICULAR ON THE CAPITAL- WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK OUR FREE URBAN BIKING SKATING CLASSES WE HAVEN'T GOT THE RESULTS THAT WE REALLY WANT TO SEE. SO HOW DO WE DEVELOP OUR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ONE THING I THINK IS REALLY KEY IS THAT WE WANT OUR FEES TO COVER STAFF TIME TO DEAL WITH ISSUES THAT ARE. ARISING WE DON'T WANT TO BE HAVE TO TAKE AWAY. FROM OUR WORK ON COMPLETE STREETS FROM OUR TRAFFIC SAFETY WORK. IS REALLY SHOULD THE IMPACT TO THE CITY SHOULD BE COST RECOVERY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US. WE CREATED A CITATION FOR WALKING PAST A TRAVEL JUST LIKE IF YOU HAVE A RIGHT RENTAL CAR WITH THE BUDGET OR ENTERPRISE. YOU GET A CITATION TO THE COMPANY WITH A COMPANY CHOOSES TO DO WITH IT IS UP TO THEM- WE'VE HAD SOME CHALLENGES FOR THEIR SOFTWARE BUT THIS MONTH WILL BE ISSUING CITATIONS TO. COMPANIES WHOSE DEVICES ARE WALKING THE SIDEWALKS. COMPANIES CAN I CHOOSE TO PASS IT ON TO THE USER IF THEY WANT. BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHO THAT USER IT AS- WE REQUIRE AT LITTLE DISTRIBUTION AND ACCESS IS REALLY KEY AGAIN I THINK IT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID- WELL THIS S NOT A CITY PROGRAM WE TREAT THIS LIKE. A COFFEE SHOP WE DON'T REGULATE HOW MANY COFFEE SHOPS. CAN OPERATE IN THE CITY OR HOW MANY COMPANIES CAN A COFFEE SHOP COMPANIES CAN OPERATE IN THE CITY. WE DO THINK WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THESE DEVICES WHICH ALL ASPECTS OF OUR CITY. THE 20% OF THEIR DEVICES MUST THOSE WHO ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WE WERE FEE STRUCTURE THE PIECE FOR THE PARKING SO WE REQUIRE THAT THEY BE A BIKE RACKS IT IS NAY DROP ZONES WE COLLECT A SMALL FEE OF TEN CENTS PER TRIP. TO PAY FOR THE PARKING SPACES- AND LASTLY. WE'RE USING THE DATA WERE COLLECTED A GOOD AMOUNT OF DATA. AND I GET THAT- TO DO MAKE DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS. WE WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE- TRIPS ARE ENDING. SO THAT WE CAN PUT IN BIKE PARKING. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR MPO SAY KAGU ROLLED. OUT OUR PICTURE PROGRAM LAST YEAR. AND ON THE BIKE PARKING MAYBE WASN'T PUT IN ALWAYS THE BEST PLACES THEY WERE HAVING SOME UNDER UTILIZE- BIKE PARKING. BUT NOW WE'RE MAKING BETTER DECISIONS USING THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT THROUGH THE SEVENTY S. PROCESS TO PUT IN THE PARKING THAT IS NEEDED. AND IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE IS MAGICAL YOU PUT IN THE RACKS AND- THE DEVICES ALONG THE BLOCK ALL GRAVITATE TO THAT PARKING IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE- PROCESS THAT WE HAD- SO THIS IS A DE OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE DATA WERE COLLECTING I NEVER GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER. HEARING ON THE DATA SO WE CAN GO INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE- SERVER THE CITY SACRAMENTO WHEN I THOUGHT EVERYBODY ELSE'S ALREADY SAID- BUT THIS IS REALLY INVOLVING FEELS AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE RESPONSIVE AND QUICK THIS IS ACTUALLY THE SECOND SET OF ITERATIONS OF REGULATORY. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT WE'VE HAD. WE CAN MOVE QUICKLY THE CITY TO ADDRESS ANY ISSUES THAT HAVE. COME UP. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO FINANCIAL IMPACT TO THE CITY. WHERE BY TAKING TWO PENNIES A TRYING TO MAKE IT A LOT OF WHAT WE DO HERE. AND SO WE WANT TO AVOID COST TO THE WORK THAT WE DO- HEY WE WANT ACCESS TO DATA I THINK IT'S BEEN PRETTY CLEAR SO THAT WE CAN MAKE DATABASES ASIAN SO WE WANT TO RESPOND TO OUR MANY COMMUNITIES- WE WERE- OR DIVERSITY AND WE- ARE CONSTANTLY GROWING WERE INCREASING INTENSITY- WE ARE I ONE OF THE MORE AFFORDABLE CITIES AND CALIFORNIA AND SO WE'RE SEEING THE INFLUX OF FOLKS COMING IN- AND THEN AGAIN WE WANT TO RETAIN OUR POLICE POWERS SO THAT WE CAN. GET THE BETTER BEHAVIOR THAT WE WANT WHEN WE CAN EDUCATION FIRST AND THEN FOR SPENT LATER. SOME OF YOU VERY MUCH I'M HAPPY TO QUESTIONS WHEN TURN OVER SAN JOSE. THANK YOU IN KEVIN WILL GO PICK WOULD REGISTER WITH YOU. YEAH AGAIN KEVIN HEPPNER WITH THE CITY OF SAN JOSE- SO ONE ECHO ALL THE COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS CITIES IF MADE- WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE BUT I'LL TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS- AND SORT OF OUR EXPERIENCES SEPARATE FROM THIS PRESENTATION SO YOU KNOW WOULD MUCH LIKE OTHER CITIES HERE THESE DEVICES BASICALLY CARD WITH VERY LITTLE NOTIFICATION IN ADVANCE OVERNIGHT- ONCE WE KIND OF GOT OVER THE THRILL AS A DEPARTMENT OF- GIVING THESE THINGS A TRY% WE DECIDED THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE A LOOK AT THINKING ABOUT SOME REGULATIONS FOR THEM. SO JUST A QUICK TIMELINE OF WHEN THESE DEVICES DERIVING WHERE WE GOT TODAY SO JUST EARLIER THIS YEAR WE HAVE ISSUED OUR ORDINANCES AND PERMITS FOR SCOOTERS AND NOW WE ARE UP TO- FIVE DIFFERENT OPERATORS IN THE CITY SAN JOSE AND- ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MARK MORE THAN SIXTY FOUR HUNDRED DEVICES BEING DEPLOYED OUR STREETS SO- SO JUST PROBABLY AND THAT THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE WANTED TO ADDRESS WITH OUR LOCAL ORDINANCES THAT FIRST OF ALL MOST IMPORTANTLY SAFETY OBVIOUSLY OUR PRIMARY MISSION IS A DEPARTMENT I LIKE OTHER CITIES ON THIS PANEL WE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AS A RESULT OF. TRAFFIC FATALITIES PARTICULARLY TO PEDESTRIANS AND OTHER VULNERABLE USERS OUR STREETS AND ROADS- SECONDLY EQUITY YOU KNOW HOW WE MAKE SURE SYSTEM THAT WASN'T DESIGNED FOR EVERYONE WORKS FOR EVERYONE- MOD CHIPS MUCH LIKE OTHER CITIES HERE WE HAVE LOFTY GOALS ABOUT HOW TO MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS AND INTO ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION INCLUDING SCOOTERS LASTLY PUBLIC LIFE AND VIBRANCY YOU KNOW IS A CITY WHO- EXPERIENCED DIDN'T LOTS OF SPRAWL AND HOW WE'VE DEVELOPED AND IS NOW WORKING TO IDENTIFY OURSELVES- YOU KNOW HOW DO WE ENSURE. THAT OUR PUBLIC LIFE AND VIBRANCY IS MAINTAINED. HI AND WITHIN THAT THE GOALS FOR A LOCAL ORDINANCE SO YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL WE WANTED TO MONITOR SO THAT'S UNDERSTANDING HOW THESE DEVICES IN TRIPS. INTERACT WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. NEXT WE WANT TO CONFIRM THE STATE LOCAL LAWS HAVE RULES AND MAKES SENSE AND THAT CAN BE ENFORCED. LASTLY WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ENSURE THAT OUR RESIDENTS CONCERNS AND COMPLAINTS CAN BE ADDRESSED BOTH ON OUR CITIES AND ON THE END OF THE OPERATORS AS WELL. SOLDIERS GET INTO AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT OUR LOCAL ORDINANCE DOES FIRST HOW WE JUST HAVE SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES ARE ON THE OPERATION OF THESE DEVICES. WE SET A MAX SPEED OF TWELVE MILES AN HOUR- WE HAVE A MODEL FOR A CUSTOMER SERVICE COMPLAINTS TO. FOR THESE OPERATORS HAVE A PUBLIC. PHONE NUMBER LISTED FOR FOLKS WHETHER THEY'RE OPERATORS OR JUST LOCAL RESIDENTS TO CONTACT EACH OF THEM WITH CONCERNS WHETHER THAT'S- YOU KNOW SCOOTER BEING PARKED ILLEGALLY BEING OPERATED- AND SAFELY THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES- WE ALSO WAS DOWN FORSMAN SINN FEIN'S SO. YOU KNOW FOR OPERATORS WHO ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE THERE IS A MECHANISM FOR US. TO REMEDY THOSE CONCERNS. LASTLY WE DO HAVE REQUIREMENTS FOR COVERAGE SO FOR COMMUNITIES OF CONCERN WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION. NOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE DEVICES ARE WE BALLOTS TO THOSE AREAS FOR- FOLKS USE THAT QUICKLY. AT LAST SECONDLY WE ALSO APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS SO THAT INCLUDES A REBALANCING THAT I JUST MENTIONED- ALSO PARKING IN LOCKING REQUIREMENTS BEYOND JUST THE KERR BRAND AND- OTHER ISSUES THAT OTHER CITIES MENTIONED WE ALSO HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH. THESE DEVICES BEING PARKING FOR FIRE HYDRANTS- THE- LIMITING ARMORED SEE RESPONSE- AND BEYOND. LASTLY JUST WITHIN THAT DATA- SO THESE ARE LOCATION DEVICE STATUS FOR INSTANCE WE'VE HAD TO TELL OPERATORS TO PULL MORE THAN FORTY SCOOTERS AT A BAR STREAMS RIVERS AND CREEKS LAST YEAR. AND YOU KNOW THESE WERE- MEAL THERE'S UNCLE NUMBER THAT HAD. TO BE REMOVED EITHER BY RESIDENTS WERE BY OPERATORS IN ADDITION TO THAT. SO WITHIN THAT DATA AS WELL FOR AGRA'S AGGREGATED IN AND OUT OF MY STRICT DATA. WITHIN DEVICES THAT'S THE MAXIMUM MINIMUM NUMBER OF DEVICES THAT ARE TO PLAYED ANYONE TIME WITHIN OUR CITY AND JUST GENERAL SAFETY PRINCIPLES FOR THOSE DEVICES TO ENSURE THEY CAN BE OPERATED SAFELY. LASTLY ON THE EQUITY AND- SO AGAIN WE BOUNCING FOR COMMUNITIES OF CONCERN BUT WE ALSO HAVE A REQUIREMENT FOR FEE REDUCTIONS FOR OUR LOCAL RESIDENTS WHO ARE TO MEET THAT TO UNDER PERCENT POVERTY THRESHOLD SO THEY CAN OPERATE AT THESE WERE INSPIRED LARGELY BY OUR- BIKESHARE- REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN LINE FROM MTC. SO THE EXPERIENCE SO LIKE MANY OTHER CITIES WE OF EXPERIENCE A LARGE NUMBER OF TRIPS MILES. MAYBE NOT AS MAYES OTHERS HERE ON THAT PANEL BUT CERTAINLY FEEL- YOU KNOW JUST SOME. THINGS TO LOOK AT YOUR RATHER THAN GOING ON THE TAX YOU CAN SEE JUST THERE'S A PICTURE IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT THAT'S FROM A NEW STORY ABOUT. THE SCOOTERS BEING IN OUR CREEKS RIVERS AND STREAMS- ACTUALLY NEWS STORY FROM GUY WHO WORKS WITH THE LOCAL FISHING- NONPROFIT. AND HE HAD I WANT TO SAY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY THESE BROKEN SCOOTERS IN ITS TRUNK. SO REALLY JUST- YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE OF LEARNING AND- MOVING INTO THAT WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED SO. FIRST OF ALL BLANCA POLICIES ARE INSUFFICIENT YOU KNOW THESE. ARE EXPERIENCES A CITY. DIFFERS FROM EVERYONE OF THE CITY'S HERE ON THE PANEL. OUR EXPERIENCE ALSO AS A CITY CHANGES STREET BY STREET BLOCK BY BLOCK NEIGHBORHOOD BY NEIGHBORHOOD AND SO. YOU KNOW FOR US WE REALIZE THAT THESE KIND OF BLANKET RESTRICTIONS OR REGULATIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE AS A CITY. MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS MODE AS% A WHOLE. NEXT JUST IN TERMS OF OUR NETWORK- WE FOUND IT'S REALLY JUST REFLECTIVE OF YOU KNOW THE QUALITY OF A BIKE NETWORK HOW OUR BIKE LANES WORK HOW THEY OPERATE THE QUALITY OF THEM GENERALLY. FOR TRANSPORTATION- SECONDLY THINKING ABOUT THIS MOVING BEYOND A FAD YOU KNOW THESE OF. THESE DEVICES ARE NOW BACK ON THE STREETS FOR. AROUND TWO YEARS HERE AND WHILE YOU KNOW THEY WERE SORT OF AN INTERESTING DEVICE NOW. IT'S YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT SO HOW DO WE REALLY WORKED. TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS MOVES US IN THE WAY THAT WE WANT TO WITH REGARDS TO REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AND YOU KNOW OTHER GOALS. THE NEXT SEVEN THING IN TERMS OF INTEGRATION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE DEVICES CAN INTEGRATE WITH IN OUR CITY AND OUR ENVIRONMENT WITHIN IT. SO THEY SUPPORT WHETHER THAT'S LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD EVENTS. LARGER EVENTS LIKE SHARKS GAMES THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THESE CAN BE USED IN OUR FISH ONLY USE WITHIN OUR CITY. LASTLY HER SECOND SIGNAL LAST JUST ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THIS IS A REAL PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN US AS A CITY AS WELL AS THE OPERATORS. AND THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW TO DELIVER THESE AND EFFECTIVE WAY. AND LASTLY LIKE OTHER CITIES OF SAID ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED FOR REALLY STRETCH THAN IS A CITY IN TERMS OF HOW. WE CAN FORCE AND THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW MY CREDIBILITY- THANKS TO THE WORK THAT AWAY IS DONE- ON AROUND DATA AND THINK ABOUT THE REGULATIONS GENERALLY BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE LOST BUT- YOU KNOW. THAT'S WE ARE NOW. THANK YOU FOR. COMPLETING THAT. CENTER RUBIO YOU HAD A QUESTION. I'M JUST CURIOUS A LITTLE BUT I KNOW IT'S A DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCE ABOUT THE CREEKS. TELL ME BOB. JERRY I DON'T WHY THAT'S HAPPENING DEFINING THE SCOOTERS INSIDE THE CREEKS AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO KERR THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR. AS FAR AS TO WHY IT'S HARD TO TELL I MEAN A LOT OF THESE THE CREEKS- THAT HAVE EXPERIENCES ARE OFTEN. ALONG THESE CORRIDORS OF TRAVEL SO YOU KNOW IT'S RARE TO SEE THEM BEING SORT OF LAUGHTER BY THE CREEK- BUT- AS FAR AS WHAT WE'RE DOING YOU KNOW WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR OPERATORS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S AB. YOU KNOW. MORE RESPONSIVE TEST TO THESE KIND OF COMPLAINTS BECAUSE FOR US YOU KNOW THESE THE OTHER CERTAINLY BATTERIES WITHIN THE SCOOTERS THAT CAN. YOU KNOW HARM THE ENVIRONMENTAL THE NATURE OF THE CREEKS AND YOU KNOW GET INTO OUR WATERWAYS AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY WANT TO WORK TO SOLVE. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT SOMETHING. HAD NOT OCCURRED TO ME SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATIONS FROM ALL THE CITIES LIKE WAS FINDING MYSELF AGREEING WITH SO MUCH OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT WAS LIKE MUSIC TWO YEARS IN TERMS OF SPECIALLY YOUR FOR YOUR FIRST POINT TO- IT'S- BONE ON THE ISSUE OF INSURANCE. THAT I HEARD BOTH LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO AGREE- THAT- THIS IS AN AREA THAT THE STATE SHOULD- ESTABLISHED MINIMUM INSURANCE-REQUIREMENTS THE A TO- ADDRESS SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES. ARE ARE THERE ANY CITIES THAT THEY WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT. NO OKAY- IN AND JUST FOR REFERENCE LOS ANGELES COULD YOU SHARE. DO YOU HAVE WHAT ARE YOUR CURRENT A MINIMUM INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS SO WE HAVE A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR UMBRELLA REQUIREMENT AND- I BELIEVE IT'S ONE MILLION DOLLARS PER INCIDENT. YEP WE CAN SHARE THE DETAILS OF THEM WHAT WE'VE HEARD SO THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE'S SENT A SIGNAL WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE INSURER IN THE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD LLOYDS OF LONDON THAT WILL EVEN RIGHT. THE COVERAGE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THERE'S A BARRIER TO ENTRY TO SMALLER START UPS WHICH ARE PREDOMINANTLY OWNED BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND SO I THINK IF THE STATE SENDS A SIGNAL THAT THIS IS A NEW INSURANCE MARKET. MY HOPE WOULD BE THAT THERE WOULD BE MORE UNDERWRITERS WILLING TO OFFER THIS KIND OF INSURANCE AND ELIMINATE THAT BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR SMALLER COMPANIES. A RIGHT. AND I ALSO WANT TO ASK SANTA MONICA WITH A WAY WHAT IS YOUR INSURANCE REQUIREMENT. I'M WE HAVE A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INCIDENT WITH NO AGGREGATE MAXIMUM. AND THEN MISTER. MCGUIRE FROM SAM CISCO YOU EMPHASIZE THE POINT THAT- THAT LOCAL LOCAL- REGULATIONS OR LOCAL NEEDS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY LOCAL REGULATIONS AND THAT YOU ARE DEFINITELY AGAINST A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. APPROACH FROM SACRAMENTO IS THAT CORRECT. ALL RIGHT IN AND I HEARD A SIMILAR SENTIMENT FROM SAN JOSE- THAT- THAT OFTENTIMES EVEN A- THINGS CAN CHANGE FROM STREET BY STREET OR NEIGHBORHOOD BY NEIGHBORHOOD CORRECT. AND SO THAT WOULD- ARGUE IN FAVOR OF A CITIES BEING ABLE TO TAILOR- YOUR SAFETY RULES FOR THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR YOUR STREETS. AND ALL CITIES WOULD AGREE WITH THAT EVEN IN A SMALL CITY THE SIZE OF SANTA MONICA WE HAVE NATIONAL DESTINATIONS WITH APPEAR IN THE PROM AND ODD- BUT WE HAVE REGULAR NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE SO EVEN IN A SMALL CITY YOU NEED A VERY WIDE VARIETY OF LOCAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SAFETY. ALL RIGHT WE JUST OFFER ONE ADDITIONAL SORT OF POINT TO THAT WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW LOS ANGELES IS LARGE ENOUGH THAT WE HAVE CITIES INSIDE OUR CITY AND- BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE CITIES HAVE PUT IN- EXTREMELY RESTRICTIVE PROGRAMS ARE OUTRIGHT BANS WHAT WE EXPERIENCE IS ALL OF THE SCOOTERS ENDING UP CLUSTERED RIGHT AROUND THE BOUNDARY OF THOSE CITIES AND SO THEY END UP BEING AND AN ISSUE FOR LOS ANGELES. I DO THINK THAT THERE IS A ROLE FOR THE STATE TO ALLOW PASSAGE AT LEAST THROUGH CITIES AND SET SOME CLARITY AROUND THAT BECAUSE EVERY COMPANY IS TREATING THOSE BANDS IN A DIFFERENT WAY SOME OF THEM WON'T EVEN LET YOU BRING THIS GOOD OR INTO THE CITIES. OTHERS pNOT STOP OTHERS WILL LET YOU BRING IT IN BUT GO SLOW THAT FEELS LIKE AN AREA WHERE SOME KIND OF REGIONAL APPROACH IS REALLY REQUIRED. ALRIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT AND- ONE LAST QUESTION FOR NOW HAVE ANY OF THE CITY'S REPRESENTED ON THIS PANEL ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF. AND MANY OF THESE. MOBILITY. PROVIDERS REQUIRE A WAIVERS OF LEGAL RIGHTS WHEN THEY WHEN THEY SIGN UP FOR THE SERVICES HAVE HAVE ANY OF YOU ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS I'M CURIOUS ABOUT OF ANY YOU AN ANSWER SO I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THIS BUT SO I KNOW WE JUST HEARD THAT CALIFORNIA DOESN'T ALLOW- SCREWS RE WRITTEN ON SIDEWALKS A STATEWIDE BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW BICYCLES CAN BE WRITEN INSIDE WALKS IN A LOT OF CITIES IN CERTAIN PLACES SO IS THAT ONE OF THOSE LAWS THAT YOU WISH YOU HAD THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE CONTROL OVER WHERE AND- WITH THE WEATHER SCOOTERS COULD BE ALLOWED INSIDE WALKS IN CERTAIN PLACES AT CERTAIN TIMES. BECAUSE I MUCH SORT OF WONDERING. BICYCLES CAN GO A LOT FASTER THAN FIFTEEN MILES AN HOUR- SO WHY HAVE WE TREATED THE SCOOTERS DIFFERENTLY THAN BICYCLES. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION- AGAIN JENNIFER CITIES SACRAMENTO IT'S VERY CONFUSING FOR OUR ACTUAL RESIDENTS OF THE CITY SACRAMENTO IS ALLOWED BIKING ON SIDEWALKS EVERYWHERE EXCEPT WHERE WE PERMIT. HAVE PROHIBITED AND WE HAVEN'T WE NEED TO HAVE WHAT WE CALL LOW STRESS BIKE WAY ADJACENT TO PROHIBIT SIDEWALK WRITING. AND THAT INCLUDES ELECTRIC ASSIST BICYCLE SO WE HAVE JOHN BIKE SHARE HERE- WHICH IS ALLWED TO USE THE CITY SIDEWALKS- HOWEVER- IT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SCOOT ON SIDEWALKS- SO IN. THE STATE IS SAID YOU CAN CITIES. DANTE BICYCLES YOU CAN REGULATE THE MEASURE WISH BUT FOR SCOOTERS YOU CAN'T AND SO IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR A POLICE DEPARTMENT WE'VE BEEN GOING OUT DOING OUR ENFORCEMENT. THAT IT IS AND DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO THE USER EVEN THOUGH WE REQUIRE THAT THERE BE STICKERS ON THEIR ON THE CERES IS A NO SCOOTING ON SIDEWALKS- WHO'S LOOKING AT ALL THE TAXES ON A SCOOTER THEY'RE NOT. I SO I THINK THE CITY SACRAMENTO'S. RESPECTIVELY WOULD LIKE THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION OURSELVES. YEAH AND THE OTHER THING IS THERE ARE CERTAINLY TIMES WHERE SOMEONE'S ON A SCOOTER THERE COULD BE MOMENTS WHERE. THERE REALLY UNSAFE ON THE STREET. AND WE'VE TAKEN THE ABILITY FOR THOSE PEOPLE AT THOSE MOMENTS TO MAKE THAT VALUE CALL. AND WHERE THEY MIGHT HAVE TO PUT THEMSELVES IN DANGER AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND- MORE WE DON'T DO THAT FOR BIKES ARE YOU BIKES WHICH YOU KNOW HAVE A LOT MORE POTENTIAL FOR DAMAGE THAN A SCOOTER SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT- AND HAVING SOME KIND OF PARITY. WITH THESE OTHER. MODES OF TRANSPORTATION SEEMS TO BE VERY PUNITIVE SOMETHING'S VERY ARBITRARY JUST FOR SCOOTERS AND NOT FOR YOU BIKES OR OTHER. TYPES OF THINGS AND AAIN. HAMPERING THEIR ABILITY TO REGULATE. I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR SACRAMENTO. AND I'M JUST CURIOUS ON TAKE IT AS A CRITICISM- SO. THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THESE PLACES WERE YOU DOCK YOUR SCOOTERS. I MAKE SENSE IN THE GROUP YOU KNOW IN MID TOWN WITH THERE'S- A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT WHAT IF WHEN YOU GET OUT TO THE SUBURBS I MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT MANY OF THESE DOCKS SO. HOW FAR THAT ARE YOU TELLING PEOPLE THEY HAVE TO EITHER WALK OR TAKEN UBER TOO SO YOU EXPECTING PEOPLE TO THEN. EITHER WALK A MILE COUPLE MILES OR TO CALL AND UBER WHEN THEY GET TO. A PLACE WHERE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF THESE DOCKS I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT THE THINKING IS WITH THAT. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T LIKE THESE WHERE AND THEY CAN CAUSE A PROBLEM. BUT AREN'T YOU ALSO LIMITING THE USE OF THESE IN YOUR SUBURBAN AREAS. IT'S GREAT QUESTIONING THE CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH RIGHT NOW. I'M SO WE REQUIRE THAT THE SHARED RIVALS. BY CAR OR DROP ZONE WHICH IS. AREA WHICH WORKS WELL IN THE- CITY OF MIDTOWN EVEN JUST OFF THE GREAT THE SECOND. PLAN PARKERS PARK IN THOSE AREAS. IT DOES NOT WORK WELL IN A MORE SUBURBAN AREAS IF YOU'RE THINKING IN THE CLINTON HEIGHTS NEIGHBORHOODS OUTSIDE- TO PASS A HIGH IT'S UP TO THE NORTH. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THIS CAN WE TREAT THEM THIS IS WHAT I WANT THE FLEXIBILITY. CAN WE TREAT THEM LIKE A MOTORCYCLE OR MOPED AND WHERE THEY CAN PARK IN THE PARKING ONLY PERPENDICULAR TO THE CURB IN A SUBURBAN AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A LANDSCAPE SHOULD BE A PARKING LEAN. A FOUR FOOT SIDEWALK IN SOMEONE'S FRONT YARD- SO COULD WE DO THAT SO THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING INTO TRYING TO GET REALLY CREATIVE ABOUT IT SO WE'RE NOT PENALIZING RIGHT NOW ALSO IF YOU. SCOOT HOMER BIKE HOME WHEN YOU. PARKED ON THE STREET IN FRONT OFYOUR HOUSE YOU WILL NOT HAVE A PENALTY. BUT IF YOU BLOCK THAT SIDEWALK YOU CAN AND PROBABLY SHOULD RECEIVE A PENALTY WE HAVE A- A RESIDENT WHO HAS A CHILD WITH A- DISABILITY IS TO LISTEN TO SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL AREA. WITH NO LANDSCAPE STRIP. THE AS NEIGHBORS WHO ARE USING THE SIDEWALKS AS PARKING FOR THE BIKES AND SCOOTERS. WHICH MEANS THAT HIS SON CAN'T TRAVEL HIS OWN NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY WANT TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATELY. WE WANT THAT PERSON TO HAVE ACCESS TO MOBILITY THROUGHOUT HIS NEIGHBORHOOD. I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE- THINKING ABOUT THIS AND BRING THESE. CREATIVE SOLUTIONS- MY LAST QUESTION. WHAT WAS MY- SO IN TERMS OF THE SCOOTERS BEING THROWN INTO THE WATER AND- INTO THE BAY AND THE RIVERS AND ALL THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE A LITTLE SCOOTER HATE GOING ON- SOMETHING HAPPENING THERE. DO ANY OF YOU. SORT OF CHARGE THE SCOOTER COMPANIES OR DO YOU HAVE A FUND THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY INTO TO DEAL WITH THIS SORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL. PROBLEM THAT THESE CREATE. SOMETIMES OF HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT DOING THAT. TAKE YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL FINE NO YOU KNOW IT IF THE SCOOTERS ARE LEFT UNATTENDED AND AN ADDRESS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY WOULD BE FINED A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DEVICE FOR EACH VIOLATION BUT THERE'S KNOWS. KILLER ENVIRONMENT TO FIND TO ADDRESS KIND OF THAT MEDICATION. SIMILARLY WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC FOR FUND FOR THAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT. THE DEVICES ACTUALLY DO GO OUT OF COMMUNICATION ACTUALLY A LOT MORE QUICKLY THAN YOU MIGHT THINK AS WELL. SO YOU KNOW OUR OUR APPROACH IS A CITY WOULD BE TO CON I FOR WHERE THE DEVICES IS AND THAT KIND OF POSITION. TO RIP RECALL TO TELL THE COMPANIES AND SAY YOU KNOW WITHIN REASON A LOT OF TIME YOU-HAVE TO REMEDY THE SITUATION- AND LEAVE IT AT THAT. HOWEVER THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS JUST WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE NUMBER OF THEM THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW OUR IS THERE IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN. YEAH IT JUST SEEMS THAT. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THESE DEVICES THAT THERE DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INCENTIVE TO GO AND TRY TO COLLECT. ONCE THEY'RE IN THE KINDEST ONCE ARE UNDER WATER. AND MAYBE. YOU KNOW THAT'S AN AREA WHERE PENALTIES. MIGHT HELP THEM. PROACTIVELY DEAL WITH THAT. TO SURVIVE. AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ENFORCEMENT FOR US AS WE- YOU KNOW BALANCING THE SORT OF FEE TO OPERATORS AND JUST IN TERMS OF THEIR COSTS FOR PUTTING A NEW ONE OUT INTO THE STREETS I MEAN. YOU KNOW IF FOR US IF WE CHARGE TOO GREAT OF A PENALTY FOR THE SOME OF THESE OPERATORS THEY HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO GO GET IT AND THEY'D RATHER JUST BUY A NEW ONE AND PUT IT ON THE STREETS AND YOU KNOW GET FROM US. WHERE IS OUR EXPERIENCE OF- PROACTIVELY BOTH REQUIRING THAT THE SCOOTERS THE LOCK TO A BIKE RACK BUT ALSO STRUCTURING- THE COST OF THIS BIKE RACKS A BILL TO THE SCREW COMPANIES FEES SO YOU CAN. YOU CAN CHARGE AND- THE COST OF PULLING OUT OF THE WATER OR YOU CAN. CHARGE OF A LOT SMALLER COST TO BUILD A GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE OF BIKE RACKS AND HAVE THOSE. SCOOTERS LOCKS OF THE VANDALISM IS LESS. IS A LESS IMPACTFUL THE PUBLIC'S OF THE PROJECT. IF YOU WERE PUTTING GEO FENCES AROUND THE VENICE SO IN LA IT'S THE VENICE CANALS IS WHERE THEY WERE ENDING UP SO WE PUT AT. A GEO FENCE AROUND THE CANALS ITSELF. AND SO BECAUSE WE HAVE THE INFORMATION IN ALMOST REAL TIME ABOUT. IF THESE THINGS END UP THERE WE- ARE ABLE TO GO OUT AND DO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IN A HIGHLY VISIBLE WAY THAT CREATES. A REAL DISINCENTIVE- FOR THE COMPANIES TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEIR WHOLE PERMIT TO OPERATE LOS ANGELES IS. AT STAKE IF THEY CAN'T. STAY OUT OF THAT THIS ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREA TO BEGIN WITH. RIGHT THANK YOU. SENATOR MORLOCK. YOUR CHAIR OF WORKING HERE IN SACRAMENTO I. LEAVE THE OFFICE LATER IN THE DAY I LIKE TO AVOID TRAFFIC AND I LIKE TO WORK COURTS QUITE IN THE OFFICE BEFORE I GO TO MY PLACE HERE. AND WHAT I'VE NOTICED WITH THE SCOOTERS IS NOT THAT THEY ARE ASSISTING PEOPLE WITH TRANSIT TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B. BUT THEY TEND TO BE RECREATIONAL AND I SEE GROUPS OF YOUNG ADULTS JUST WHIZZING BY- FLYING OFF CURBS A IN GROUPS IT'S JUST A RECREATIONAL KIND OF. EXERCISER LIKE A NIGHT OUT KIND OF A OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW HARD IT MY OBSERVING. THIS CORRECTLY- WILL. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THEY REALLY BEING USED FOR WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T COLLECTED THE DATA ON THAT SUCH A GREAT QUESTION- WE DO KNOW THAT OUR- OURDEVICES ARE GETTING A LOT OF TRIPS. THAT THERE ABOUT A MILE ON SCOOTERS IN A LITTLE BIT TWO MILES ON BIKES ARE FOR EACH TRIP- SO THAT'S INCLUDED MAYBE MORE THE RECREATION ME PART OF IT IS RECOGNITION MAYBE THEY'RE GOING TO WATCH THE KINGS PLAY A GOLDEN ONE. WE DON'T KNOW YET WE WILL BE ROLLING OUT A USER SURVEY THE SPRING- FOR ALL OUR MEMBER- MORE PERMIT COMPANIES TO GET A BETTER UNDERSANDING OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING. WE ARE IT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD EDUCATING THE USERS SO THEY KNOW- HOW TO SAFELY USE A SCOOTER OR SHARED BIKE AND URBAN ENVIRONMENTS. WE OFFER FREE CLASSES EVERY MONTH- WE WENT OUT WITH PD AND CH FEET GIVEN OUT INFORMATIONAL FLIERS WE'VE DONE OUR VIDEOS SOCIAL MEDIA- BUT IT HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH WE RELY ON THE COMPANIES WE ACTUALLY REQUIRE IN OUR PERMIT. THEN THEY ALSO DO THEIR OWN EDUCATION I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY COME TO FRUITION OR TO THE LEVEL THAT WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED- AND SO WE WILL BE ROLLING OUT ON ENFORCEMENT AND SCOOTING ON SIDEWALKS AND- PARKING ILLEGALLY BALKING ABOUT THE TRAVEL. THIS MONTH ON IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE PUNITIVE IT IS NOT MEANT TO COLLECT ANY SORT OF CITATION FEET BUT IT'S REALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE. IN THE FOLKS OUT THERE UNDERSTAND THAT GOOD BEHAVIOR. BUT A WITH ANY OF THESE. MOVING. OPPORTUNITIES SKATEBOARDS SETTER OF PEOPLE GET PROFESSIONAL DOING INTERESTING. THINGS WITH THEM- SO I JUST WONDER WOULD THE OWNERS OF THESE SCOOTERS WOULD WOULD THEY REALIZE ALL MY GOODNESS THEY WENT FROM POINT A TO POINT B. AT A RATHER HIGH SPEED. MOST OF. DONE SOME KIND OF JUMPING COULD HAVE. YOU KNOW SHORTEN THE LIFE OF A VEHICLE LIKE MAYBE I SHOULD ASK THAT IN THE NEXT PANEL BUT- I I'M JUST SEEING THEM IS JUST TOYS THAT KIDS ARE JUST HAVING A FUN TIME AT NIGHT ZOOMING THROUGH THE ARENA AND THE CAPITAL AREA. SO THANK YOU. SIR MCGUIRE. THE QUICKNESS TO CHAIR A GOING TO- LOS ANGELES MANAGER MANAGER YOU MENTION SIX PIECES OF DATA CAN YOU TAKE THEM OFF REAL QUICK THAT YOU'RE COLLECTING- TRIPS START TRIP END VEHICLE ID TRIP TIME- AND THEN- THE FLEET THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES AND ANY GIVEN LOCATION AND I CAN'T REMEMBER THE SIX ONE BUT THAT'S THE THAT'S THE L. O. AND THE ROUTE THE ROUTE ITSELF BUT WE DON'T GET THE ROUTE IN REAL TIME WE ONLY GET THAT TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE RIDE IS DONE SO THE START IN THE END WE GET THE REST OF THOSE IN MORE OR LESS REAL TIME. BECAUSE WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND THINGS ARE- INNER CITY AT ANY GIVEN TIME WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT AS WELL IF YOU DON'T MIND. FOR EACH OF THE PANELISTS CAN YOU PLEASE PROVIDE. THE COMMITTEES YOUR INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WOULD BE GREAT- THAT YOU HAVE IMPLEMENTED THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL AS WE MOVE FORWARD- WHEN I GO TO SEE COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO IN REGARDS TO- HAVING TO LOCK. THE DEVICE AT THE END. SO IT IS. A IS SOMEONE LOCKS INTO A- IT'S REGARD TO SAID ALSO COUNT TO ME WHAT WOULD YOU SEE HOW DOES THAT WORK EXACTLY. YES SO WE DON'T WANT THE DEVICE TO BE LOCKED PLACES WITH IT WHETHER OUT SAFE SO WE DON'T WANT THEM LOCKED TO- TO THE SIDES OF BUILDINGS OR THINGS LIKE THAT- IT'S A PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE'LL HAVE TO BE LOCKED BY CRACKS OR TO PRIVATELY OWNED BY CRACKS- ON EITHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE PROPERTY- WE DON'T WANT TO. MISS A PERFECT SENSORS AT. THAT'S A PERFECT SCIENCE OR. IT'S A IT IS AN IMPERFECT SIDE YEAH IT'S OR BUT- BUT EVEN THE A PERFECT SIZE IT'S SO MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY WERE WHEN THEY WERE BEING PART OF THE MIDDLE THE SIDEWALKS AS WE SEE THIS IS AN EVOLUTION CAN YOU JUST GIVE US. OVER UNDER HERE SO FROM. HE STARTED THAT TO NOW ARE YOU LOOKING AT A- SIXTY PERCENT. DIFFERENCE AS FAR AS- CHANGING AND- LACK OF BLOCKAGE WALKS THROUGH THAT REALLY QUICKLY. YEAH I THINK THE BEST INDICATOR AT USE THE COMPLAINTS WE GET. SO LIKE I SAID BEFORE WE HAD A REGULATORY PROGRAM IN PLACE WE WERE GETTING TWO THOUSAND COMPLAINTS. A MONTH AND IN COUNTY OVER FIVE HUNDRED SCOOTERS PER MONTH- AT THIS POINT WE ARE RECEIVING. ON THE ORDER OF A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED COMPLAINTS. PER MONTH AND- IT SOUNDED IS IT'S NEGLIGIBLE IT'S A- YOU KNOW. A FEW SCOOTERS. IT'S INTERESTING. THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE OF YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME IN HELPING US WITH THIS SERVICE. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IS AGAIN COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THINK OF THE LOCALS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO WEIGH IN. BECAUSE ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL AND I'M ASKING. HAVE YOU FOUND IT THE ABILITY TO ROLL BACK ENFORCEMENT WHEN YOU FOUND OUT IT WASN'T WORKING AND. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CAN FORSMAN. ISN'T IT JUST LIKE OF THE SHOPPING CART AND FORCED WE'RE COLD COULD FORCE MEANT WENT OUT AND PICKED THEM UP IF THEY WERE THERE. GOING FORWARD IN BEING ABLE TO- CHARGE A FEE FOR THE FOR THE PICK UP THERE pABOUT THE CREEKS I UNDERSTAND OVER LAKE MERRITT THEY PULLED SIXTY OUT OF LAKE MERRITT. RECENTLY SO- BUT YOU KNOW THEY SAY. HAVE YOU FOUND A- BUILDING- SO.HAVE YOU FOUND IT IS ROLLING BACK ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE AND WORKING WITH SKINNER COMPANIES. I'M IN SANTA MONICA OR JUST WRAPPING UP THE FIRST PILOT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE NOTICING IS THAT- YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANNA ISSUE CITATIONS THAT ARE NOT AND FOR THAT ARE NOT DEFENSIBLE AND SO IT'S FAIRLY REASONABLE TO ISSUE CITATIONS FOR THINGS THAT ARE QUANTIFIABLE AND CLEARLY SPELLED OUT SPELLED OUT. HOWEVER AS A PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SOURCE IN AN OSTENSIBLY THE SHOULD BE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE THEY'RE USING THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY- THE SOME OF THOSE OUTCOMES ABOUT EQUITY AND ABOUT ACCESS AND DISTRIBUTION THOSE ARE THOSE ARE REALLY HARD TO ISSUE CITATIONS FOR- SO I THINK- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. M. YES WE'RE SEEING THAT ENFORCEMENT ISN'T EFFECTIVE FOR CERTAIN OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT TO- ACHIEVE TOGETHER AND SO WE ARE I THINK ALL WE HAVE OUR HEADS TOGETHER TO KIND OF THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE TOOLS THAT ARE NEEDED THAT OUR PARTNERSHIP TOOLS. TO GET TO THE OUTCOMES BECAUSE CITIES DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO OUT SITE IT'S OF NO INTEREST TO US TO CHASE SCOOTERS- IT IS OF INTEREST FOR SCOOTERS TO BE AVAILABLE AFTER WILL AFFORDABLE AND SAFE AND SO THAT'S WHY SORT OF WE'RE STILL AT THE TABLE. AND I THINK THIS SORT OF LOCAL CONTROL LOCAL PROBLEM SOLVING IS STILL IN ITS RELATIVE JUVENILE STATE- AS WE FIGURED OUT SO YEAH WE'RE WE'RE ACTIVELY KIND OF PULLING BACK AND PUSHING FORWARD AND TESTING IN TRYING- ON A- PRETTY MUCH MONTHLY BASIS. CENTER THANK YOU SO MUCH WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU EACH OF YOU FOR TAKING TIME AND YOU'RE REALLY BUSY SCHEDULES BE WITH US TODAY FANTASTIC JOB THANK YOU SO MUCH- WE'RE NOT GONNA BE MOVING ON TO OUR- FINAL. PANEL HERE IN THIS IS WE'RE GONNA HEAR. FROM STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES. ON CHAIR MOBILITY REGULATION YOU CAN HEAR TWO DIFFERENT AND DISTINCT SITES. FIRST OVER HERE FROM EDWARD FOO IS A SENIOR REGULATORY COUNSEL FOR BIRD. ORGAN NAY NAY HERE FROM OUR SINGER GOING IS HE'S THE SENIOR REGULATORY COUNSEL FOR NEW MOBILITY. AND UBER. AND WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM CRYSTAL AND HE'S THE A PAST PRESIDENT. FROM THE CALIFORNIA CONUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. LISTEN JIM IF IT WORKS FOR THIS COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO MISTER FOO FIRST IN REGARD TO SCREW THE ONUS AND THEN MISTER DOLAN. WE WELCOME EACH OF YOU HERE EACH OF YOU OF FIVE MINUTES WE'LL GIVE YOU A ONE MINUTE HEADS UP. AS WE START GETTING TOWARDS THE END OF YOUR TESTIMONY. EDWARD THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE TO FOUR STORES YOUR FIVE MINUTES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY NAME IS EDWARD FOO IT'S A REAL HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY AMONG SO MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S BRIGHTEST TRANSPORTATION MONTHS- I AM THE- HEAD. OF REGULATORY POLICY AD LEGISLATION FOR BURKE. THE COMPANY THAT TWO YEARS AGO IN SANTA MONICA PLACE TENDS SHARED SCOOTERS ON THEIR SIDEWALKS. AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF US COULD HAVE PREDICTED WHAT HAS. WHAT WE HAVE SET IN MOTION. I THINK IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH WE HAVE LEARNED IN THESE PAST TWO YEARS CREATING THIS INDUSTRY FROM SCRATCH AND I THINK OF THOSE TWO YEARS. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN. AS A SORTS CEASE OFFER MICHAEL BILLETING. IN THAT TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS ABOUT THE INDUSTRY WE AGGRESSIVELY EXPANDED ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND- YES WE DIDN'T ALWAYS ASK FOR PERMISSION. AND I THINK THAT MEANS LEARNING THAT WE HAD WAS THAT THIS WASN'T THE RIGHT APPROACH. THAT NO MATTER HOW POPULAR ARE SCREWS WERE WITH WE SHOULD JST BE COPYING THE PLAYBOOKS OF OTHERS. AND THAT WE HAD A SHARE RESPONSIBILITIES THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE IT. AND THAT WAS OUR FIRST MAJOR LEARNING. AND SO WE MAY TWENTY NINETEEN ABOUT THE CITIES WE STOP WATCHING WITHOUT PERMISSION. WE REACHED OUT TO EVERY CITY IN CALIFORNIA. TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN SURE DOC WAS PROGRAM. EACH WITH THEIR OWN RULES TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY WE'VE HEARD A LOT. ABOUT THEM FROM- FROM THE PREVIOUS PANEL. AND THEY'VE DONE VERY WELL AND A SON BEAR IT REMARKABLY WELL FOR THE GROWTH OF SHARED MICHAEL ABILITY AND CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER WHAT I WANT TO BRING TO WHAT WHAT I WANT TO DISCUSS TODAY. IS THIS IS FROM OUR SIDE. THE SECOND MAJOR LEARNING THAT WE LEARN FROM THESE REGULATION. IS THAT IT WORKS BUT IT COMES AT A COST. AND I DON'T MEAN THE COST UPON US BIRD THE CORPORATE AND SEE I MEAN UPON OUR WRITERS. IN LESS THAN A YEAR THE COST OF SHARED MICHAEL ABILITY IN CALIFORNIA HAS. TRIPLED AND IT CONTINUES TO GROW. IN SOME AREAS RIDERSHIP HAS DROPPED FIFTY TO EIGHTY PERCENT. MUCH OF ITS SWITCHING BACK TO CARSON DNC'S. AND SO WE'RE HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO RECONCILE THOSE TWO LEARNINGS. I HOPE THAT WE ALL AGREE THAT LEARNING FROM THE LESSONS OF T. AND SEES. THAT SHARED MICHAEL BILLY IS SOMETHING THAT IS BEST REGULATED ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. I HOPE THAT WE ALSO ALL AGREE. THE CALIFORNIA WHAT CAN'T BE PUSHING PEOPLE AWAY FROM BIKES AND SCOOTERS. AND TOWARDS CARS. AND IF ANYTHING THE OPPOSITE SHOULD BE TRUE. IN FACT EXISTING CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE TWO ONE TWO TWO ZERO ALREADY SAYS THAT. AND SO THESE TWO GOALS ARE POLICY PILLARS. AND ACHIEVING THE REQUIRES COOPERATION BETWEEN NOT JUST BIRD IN THE CITIES BUT ALSO THE STATE. AND WE KNOW THE SOME PART BECAUSE WE ASK CALIFORNIA'S DIRECTLY. WITH ASK THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU TAKE CARS LESSEN WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU TAKE BURDEN. OTHER MICHAEL BUILDING MORE. IN ALMOST EVERY TIME WE ALWAYS GET THE SAME THREE ANSWERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FIRST IS INFRASTRUCTURE. WRITERS DON'T FEEL SAFE. FROM CARS WITHOUT A PROTECTED BY PLANE. SO THEY STAY IN CARS PERPETUATING A VICIOUS CYCLE. I THINK WE'RE ALL BUT VERY WELL FAMILIAR WITH THE CHALLENGES OF BUILDING COMPLETE STREETS. AND SO I WON'T REHASH THEM. BUT THAT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE'VE INTRODUCED MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS TO MY- MOBILITY. HELPING THEM. APPRECIATE WHAT PROTECTED BY PLEASE CAN DO FOR THE COMMUNITIES. SECOND IS AVAILABILITY. FOR TRANSPORTATION MODE TO BE RELIABLE AND A PART OF YOUR ROUTINE TO HAS TO BE READILY AVAILABLE. AND SO THAT'S WHY IN SAN FRANCISCO ALONE. THERE ARE FIFTY THOUSAND TNC DRIVERS ON THE ROADS. SO THAT WHENEVER YOU PULL OUT YOUR PHONE YOU CAN FIND A TNC CAR WITHIN A FEW MINUTES. HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO DOUGLAS MICHAEL ABILITY SAN FRANCISCO'S LIMITED TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DEVICES ONE TWENTIETH THE NUMBER OF TNC DRIVERS. IMAGINE IF IT'LL TWENTY TIMES AS LONG TO GET A TNC CAR. COULD YOU WOULD YOU TO RELY ON THAT AS AN OPTION TO GET TO WORK. OR WOULD YOU FIND SOMETHING ELSE. AND FINALLY IS COSTS. AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THE COST OF SHARE MICHAEL BUILDING CALIFORNIA HAS TRIPLED IN LESS THAN A YEAR. IN SOME PLACES AND NOW COSTS MORE TAKE A SCOOTER BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE A TNC CAR. THIS IS DUE TO MANY REASONS ONE OF WHICH HAS TO DO WITH THE DYSTROPHY STRUCTURE THAT. THAT MOBILITY FACES IN CALIFORNIA. THROUGHOUT THE STATE CALIFORNIANS WRITING IN THE TNC CAR. PAID ZERO POINT CONTRAST DEPENDING ON THE CITY CALIFORNIA'S WRITING ON SHARED BIKES AND SCOOTERS PAY BETWEEN TWENTY TO EIGHTY TIMES THAT. ENOUGH FIGURE CONTINUES TO RISE. FOR SURE MICHAEL ABILITY TO FULFILL ITS MOTION POTENTIAL HAS TO BE AN OPTION AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE SEE THESE AS THE THREE MAKE CONSTRAINTS ON THE GROWTH OF MICHAEL BUILDING CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABILITY AND COST. THESE ARE NOT CHALLENGES THAT CAN BE SOLVED BY BIRD LOAN OR BY THE CITY'S ALONE OR BY THE STATE ALONE AND THEY HAVE TO BE SOLVED BY ALL THREE OF US TOGETHER. WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY FINAL POINT. HISTORICALLY A LOT OF TECH COMPANIES MISSIONS HAVE BEEN FOUR THOUSAND- OR EVEN OPPOSED TOWARDS THE PUBLIC INTEREST. BUT OUR MISSION ISN'T TO SELL POLITICAL ADS OR TO GET YOUR PACKAGE ONE DAY SOONER OUR MISSION IS TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF CARS AND I BELIEVE THAT'S A MISSION THE ALMOST EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM SHARES. WERE ALL ON THE SAME TEAM AND SO AS WE PIONEERED THIS INDUSTRY WE HOPE TO ALSO PIONEER A NEW PLAYBOOK THAT'S HOW WE INTERACT WITH LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS ONE THAT ISN'T BASED ON ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS. BUT TOWARDS COLLABORATING TOWARDS OUR SHARED POLICY GOALS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS ABOUT THE INDUSTRY AND TWENTY NINETEEN WAS ABOUT CITIES BUT I HOPE THE TWENTY TWENTIES THE YEAR. IN WHICH THE SEIZE ALL SETTLES AND WE FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN THE INDUSTRY PRIVATE ENTERPRISE. LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE GOVERNMENT TO WORK TOGETHER ON A CLIMATE CONGESTION AND SAFETY GOALS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE TODAY WERE NOT ENTERED OR MISC GONE IS. A SENIOR REGULATORY COUNSEL- NEW MOBILITY FOR OVER THE FLOORS GEORGIA FIVE MINUTES ARE GIVE YOU MINUTES UP. THANKS HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MCGUIRE AND FRAZIER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES- MY NAME SOUTH WE'RE GONNA SAME AS SENIOR REGULATORY COUNCIL FOR NEW ABILITY AT UBER. AND I FOCUS ON MY PROMOTE BILLY OPERATIONS THROUGH DROP. I WANT TO SHARE A BIT ABOUT MY EXPERTISE- I HAVE WORKED FOR OVER TEN YEARS IN PUBLIC POLICY AND REGULATION. DURING MY YEARS OF GOVERNMENT SERVICE HAVE BEEN A REGULATOR I'VE BEEN A POLICY ADVISER TO BUILD ADMINISTRATIVE AND ELECTED OFFICIALS. SO WITH THAT I APPRECIATE THE ROLE THE GOVERNMENT'S ESPECIALLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO PLAY IN SHAPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF AMERICAN CITIES. AND I APPRECIATE THAT DEVELOPING. POLICY RESPONSES TO NEW TECHNOLOGY IS NEVER EASY. I SPENT THE LAST SIX MONTHS AT UBER REVIEWING EVERY APPLICATION WE SUBMIT IN CALIFORNIA AND WORKING WITH OUR OPERATIONS TEAM TO SUPPORT ANY COMPLIANCE ENQUIRIES. I FOR THE LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PERMITS SO I APPRECIATE THE RANGE OF ISSUES THAT YOU MAY BE HEARING FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS. WHICH IS I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TO SHARE MORE ABOUT JUMPS APPROACH IN THE SPACE. TODAY JUMP OPERATES IN MORE THAN TWO DOZEN US CITIES INCLUDING FIVE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA THIS INCLUDE SACRAMENTO SAN FRANCISCO SANTA CRUZ SANTA MONICA AND LOS ANGELES. WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY TODAY. AND INCLUDES ALSO SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL MARKETS INCLUDING PARIS ROME AND BERLIN. WE SUPPORT COMMONSENSE REGULATION AS WITH ANYTHING THE CHALLENGE IN THE OPPORTUNITY IS IN THE DETAILS WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A WAY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS INCLUDING THEIR PRIVACY AND REGULATOR INDUSTRY AND WOULD DO IT WITHOUT SACRIFICING PUBLIC SAFETY. OR GOVERNMENT PLANNING EFFORTS. GETTING THIS RIGHT WILL REQUIRE AN ONGOING COLLABORATIVE APPROACH BETWEEN CITY REGULATORS INDUSTRY AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND ANYTHING LESS WILL BE A SHORT TERM PANACEA REALLY A CHECK THE BOX EFFORT. AND IT'S GOING TO JEOPARDIZE THE WHAT OUR GOALS IN THE LONG RUN. WE'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE ABILITY HAS AND WE REALLY WANT TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE HERE. SO TO THAT END WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXPERIENCE AND QUALITY MATTER TO ENSURE RELIABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE HAVE EIGHT YEARS EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH GOVERNMENT PARTNERS AND WE PROBABLY MAINTAIN MORE THAN FOUR CONTRACTS AND PER FORTY CONTRACTS AND PERMITS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. MICHAEL MOBILITY OFFERS YOUR CONSTITUENTS TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS THAT ARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND MORE CONVENIENT AND MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY. THE GOAL FOR BOTH JUMP IN OVER IS TO CONNECT RURAL OR URBAN AREAS TO ONE ANOTHER BY CREATING A SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE DIRECTLY WITH IN ONE APP. BIKES IS GUNNERS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE TRAFFIC AND ALLEVIATE THE NEED FOR PARKING. AND SIMPLY PUT MICHAEL MOBILITY PROVIDERS OUT PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO REDUCING URBAN AMERICANS DEPENDENCY ON CARS. WHAT I BIGGER BACKGROUND ON JOB I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS HOW WE APPROACH REGULATION SPECIFICALLY. WE RECOGNIZE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS WE KNOW THAT CITIES CARE MOST ABOUT SAFETY OVERSATURATION STREET VERSUS SIDEWALK USAGE PARKING VIOLATIONS AND EQUITY CONCERNS AND I THINK THOSE WERE OUTLINED OUT QUITE NICELY BY MISS TO ON WHY IT AND HER SITES. OVERSEEING THESE PROGRAMS IS ALSO RESOURCES INTENSIVE TODAY AS CITY'S MINISTERS HERE CAN ATTEST AND HAVE IT TESTED TODAY. OUR HOPE IS AT BEST PRACTICES WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND ADOPTED INTO THE REGULATORY SCHEME TO REDUCE THIS BURDEN- AND WE WOULD WELCOME THE CERTAINTY AS WELL I THINK WE'VE HEARD TODAY THAT A LOT OF TESTIMONY THAT THERE'S NO DOMINANT REGULATORY SCHEME. AND THEN THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW FOR CONTINUED INNOVATION IN THE SPACE. TO GET THERE WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ON MEANINGFUL AND RESPONSIBLE REGULATIONS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE IMPORTANT PARTNERS FOR ENSURING PUBLIC SAFETY WE APPRECIATE THE CLOUT ABILITY TO COLLABORATE WITH THEM AND I WANTED TO SHARE RECENT EXAMPLE. WE ARE EXCITED TO PARTICIPATE IN A RECENT WORKSHOP WITH THE LAPD TO SHARE THAT JOHN VIA UBER HAS AN ESTABLISHED PORTAL FOR HANDLING LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUESTS. BUILDING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE REALLY GOOD INVESTMENT FOR EVERYBODY FOLLOWING THE WORKSHOP MOST RECENTLY AN LAPD DETECTIVE CONTACTED OUR WEST HOLLYWOOD LIAISON FOR ASSISTANCE WITH A HATE CRIME. OR A SUSPECT HAD USED TO ADD RIGHT SURE SCOOTER. WITHIN THE HOUR THE DETECTIVE WAS ABLE TO GET HIS ACCOUNT CREATED AND HAS WARRANT SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY. CITIES CAN REALLY CHAMPION- INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY TO KEEP SIDEWALKS CLEAR AND ENSURE MY COME ABILITY IS SEEN AS A BENEFIT AND NOT A HEADACHE BY USING INTELLIGENT REGULATIONS. I BELIEVE OTHER PANELISTS HAD DISCUSSED- DISCUSSED A COUPLE OPTIONS INCLUDING PERFORMANCE SPACE PERMITS I BELIEVE THIS IS A TECHNIQUE THAT SOME PLAYED BY SANTA MONICA WITH SOME SUCCESS- WE WOULD ENCOURAGE LIKE WHEN USING PERFORMANCE BASED PERMITS THAT. GOOD ACTORS ARE REPORTED. AS WE WERE LOCK TO BIKE REQUIREMENTS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT OFFICIALS FROM SAN FRANCISCO REALLY EMPHASIZED- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT OUR JUMP BIKES HOWEVER- HAVE A TRUE LOCKING DESIGN- WHICH HELPS KEEP THE CITY'S. STREETS ORDERLY AND SAFE. I ALSO REALLY SUPPORT RIGHT SIZE FLEETS TO AVOID OVERCROWDING ISSUE AND IMPLEMENTING TRIP OPTIMIZE FLEA CAPS. THIS IS THE APPROACH THAT WE'VE SEEN IN PLACES LIKE WASHINGTON DC. ONE MINUTE. WE'RE ALSO USING TECHNOLOGY TO PILE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS LIKE SIDEWALK DETECTION AND MAPPING SO WE CAN IMPROVE THE LIMITATIONS OF GPS AND CREATE A MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK LOOP TO USERS ABOUT RIPRAP WRITING BEHAVIOR. WE CAN ALSO DRAW ON OUR EXPERIENCE NOW IN THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY FOR EXAMPLE WE ALREADY HAVE COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE POLICIES WE FOLLOW ALL LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL INSURANCE AN INDEMNITY REQUIREMENTS. AND WE SUPPORT HOLDING OPERATORS FINANCIALLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACCIDENTS AND PERSONAL INJURY ARISING FROM THEIR OWN AND NEGLIGENCE. LASTLY OVER AND GENTLY SURE MY CREDIBILITY CAN OFFER VALUABLE DATA IN INSIDE TO CITIES AND OTHER PARTNERS- THAT IMPROVE SAFETY AND INFORM INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSIT PLANNING. AND COURAGE OFTEN USE OF THESE MOBILITY DEVICES. WE ALSO SUPPORT UNIFORM DATA SHARING TO STANDARDS FOR CITIES TO RECEIVE TIMELY AGGREGATED DATA SO THAT THEY CAN RESPOND WHEN TRAFFIC PATTERNS HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND TRENDS CHANGE. HOWEVER WE DO NOT SUPPORT THE DIRECTION WE'VE SEEN IN SOME CITIES THAT REQUIRES REAL TIME LOCATION DATA FROM WRITERS. ON A TRIP AS A CONDITION OF THE PERMIT. WHEN THE ITY HAS THE ABILITY TO FIGURE OUT OF A CERTAIN SET A SENATE'S TAKING A CERTAIN DEVICE IN A CERTAIN LOCATION THE VERY MINUTE THAT THEY DO. AND THEN ALL THE PLACES THAT THEY GO ALONG THE WAY WE ARE CONCERNED. AS OUR PRIVACY GROUPS. THIS IS A REALLY COMPLICATED AND NEW AREA OF THE LAW AND WE'D REALLY ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE TO TAKE THE TIME TO SLOW DOWN AND UNDERSTAND ALL THE NUANCES HERE. BOTH CALIFORNIA LAW AND ACTO DEFINED LOCATION AS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA AND THAT REQUIRES DEDICATED PROTECTIONS. WE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE COMMITTEES. IN THE COMING YEAR. WE MUST CAPITALIZE ON THE A UNLIMITED BENEFITS OF MY CAMILLUS STANDS TO PROVIDE TO FUTURE GENERATIONS. A SHARED ZERO ZERO EMISSION RELIABLE EFFICIENT AND AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTION. THERE WERE THERE ARE AND WILL BE CHALLENGES THAT A LOT ARISE ALONG THE WAY. BUT WE A TRUMP AND UBER FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT MIKE MOBILITY OPERATORS I GOVERNMENTS CAN MAKE GREAT STRIDES AT REDUCING CONESTION AND SLASHING EMISSIONS BY PRACTICALLY WORKING TOGETHER. THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS WE HAVE THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO TURN OVER TO OUR LAST ANALYST OF THE DAY. CRYSTAL AND PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS A CALIFORNIA STOLE AS GOOD AS HE'S HER FOUR STORES THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO BOTH THE CHAIRS IN THOSE. ARE HERE TODAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE BILL THAT'S BEEN PUT FORTH. IT'S INTERESTING BUT THE LAST TO SPEAK IS THE ONE WHO IS WORRIED ABOUT THE WRITER. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IS NOT LOST IN THIS. THERE'S BUT YOU KNOW AND WE HEARD THAT THEY WANT TO BOUNCE BETWEEN INDUSTRY. OF GOVERNMENT. AND PRIVATE. INDUSTRY GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE ENTITIES YES BUT THAT BOUNCE NEEDS TO INCLUDE SAFETY AND PROTECTION TO THOSE WHO ARE USING THEM. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH MOM AND POP ORGANIZATIONS. WE'RE DEALING WITH LEFT WE'RE DEALING WITH UBER. I WAS PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS AND THE DRAFTING OF THE TNC BILL THAT RELATED TO INSURANCE I WAS HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT MAKING SURE THAT WE GOT A DEAL DONE. I KNOW HOW THAT SAUSAGE WAS MADE WE HEARD THE SAME ARGUMENTS THAT WE'RE HEARING NOW WHEN WE HEARD ABOUT DNC'S INSURANCE IS GOING TO STYMIE THE INDUSTRY WE'RE GOING TO BE SOMEHOW RESTRICTED IF WE HAVE TO BE- REQUIRED TO FOLLOW LEGISLATION OR WE HAVE TO BE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW RULES. WE SAW THE EXACT SAME BEHAVIOR HERE THAT WE SAW WITH PNC'S DUMP THEM ON THE STREET THEN ASK FOR REGULATION LATER. THIS IS NOT NEW THIS IS JUST A NEW FORM OF TRANSPORTATION TRANSPORTATION IS NOT NEW. WHAT WE ARE SEEING WITH THE STATISTICS IS THAT 55% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INJURED ON THESE THINGS ARE INJURED WITH HEAD INJURIES. WHERE DO THESE PEOPLE GO WE'RE HEARING THAT THESE ARE MANY FOLKS WHO HAVE LOWER INCOME. THEY WIND UP IN THE CITY'S EMERGENCY ROOMS THEY WIND UP SEEKING MEDICARE NOW SO WHO IS PAYING FOR THE COST THE TRUE COST OF THE USE OF THESE ITEMS WHEN PEOPLE ARE INJURED. THE TAXPAYERS ARE NOT THE COMPANIES WHO ARE FORWARDING THIS TYPE OF A SERVICE IN THERE IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS INSURANCE TO COVER INJURY TO PERSONS. WHO ARE USING THESE DEVICES BY HAVING A SMALL SURCHARGE ON WHATEVER THERE IS THE COST THIS IS NOT NEW THIS IS HAPPENED FOR EVER WE HAVE MINIMUM INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS ON CARS THIS IS JUST ANOTHER FORM OF A VEHICLE. INDEED WE NOW HAVE I SAW TODAY THE BIRD IS RENTING THESE BY THE MONTH. SO THIS IS NOT JUST LAST MILE TRANSPORTATION BUT FOR TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE YOU CAN RENT ONE OF THESE SCOOTERS EXCLUSIVELY FOR A MONTH. I KNOW OF NO CAR RENTAL AGENCY THAT WOULD SEEK THE BENEFITS THE PROTECTION OF THEIR CONTRACTS WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY UP TO ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. A RESTRICTION IN A WAIVER OF LIABILITY EVEN IF THEIR DEVICE CATCHES ON FIRE IN YOUR HOME. IF THE DEVICE FALLS APART WHICH WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF HANDLEBARS COME OFF OF PEOPLE SUFFERING HEAD INJURIES WE SAW A LONGTIME PULLING THESE THINGS OFF THE STREET BECAUSE THEY WERE CATCHING FIRE IN PEOPLE'S HOMES AND WE SAW BREAKING MALFUNCTIONS WHERE PEOPLE WERE GOING HEAD OVER HEELS. AND SUFFERING SERIOUS INJURIES THE WAY THEIR CONTRACTS ARE WRITTEN RIGHT NOW A COMPLETE WAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY AGAINST THEM EVEN IF IT'S THEIR PRODUCT THAT FAILS WITH A HUNDRED DOLLAR CAPON LIABILITY. SO YES THERE NEEDS TO BE A BALANCE BUT THAT BALANCE CAN'T LEAVE OUT THE CONSUMER WHO MAY BE HURT IN THE COST IT WILL HAVE ON THE GOVERNMENT. THESE ARE CAUSING REAL LIFE THREATENING INJURIES AND SO WHEN REGULATION YES NEEDS TO HAPPEN BUT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT REGULATION THAT AFFECTS THE CONSUMER IN THIS WAY IT HAS TO HAPPEN ON THE STATE LEVEL. IT CAN HAPPEN ON THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL WE HEAR COSTA BECOME PROHIBITIVE WE HEARD THAT THE COSTS TRIPLED BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THE COST IS PROBABLY INITIALLY VERY LOW TO ENCOURAGE ADOPTION. WE HAVE OF THE VARIOUS CITIES THAT ARE REQUIRING INSURANCE AND IT'S NOT PROHIBITED ANY ENTRANCE FROM THIS MARKET OR PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY- USING THESE OR BUSINESSES THAT ARE ALLOWING THEM. SO JUST A FEW THINGS THAT ARE IN EACH ONE OF THEIR AGREEMENTS. NO CLASS ACTIONS HANDLE DOWN IN LOS ANGELES ATTORNEYS FEES FOR. THE WINNER. OF A RELEASE OF LIABILITY INCLUDING ALL AFFILIATES MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS OF THE VEHICLES IN THEIR PARTS. THE WAIVER OF ANY MUNICIPAL- LIABILITY AND A COMPLETE ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK. SO WHAT WE'RE HEARING AND THESE THINGS ARE LIKE JUMPING OUT OF PLANES ARE THESE THINGS ARE SOMEHOW RECREATION DEVICE I LISTEN CAREFULLY TO YOUR- COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THEY'RE BEING USED I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO. THESE ARE BEING USED FOR TRANSPORTATION. AND THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE NOT WEARING HELMETS THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT THEY WEAR A HELMET. INDEED THERE'S NOTHING THAT THE COMPANIES DO TO MAKE SURE THEY WEAR A HELMET BY EVENING USING WHAT WE HAVE NOW WHICH IS FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE. IT'S BEING USED ACROSS THE BOARD AND OTHER THINGS. SO WHO'S GOING TO PICK UP THE BILL FOR THEIR ADVANCEMENT IN TECHNOLOGY THE BOUNCING THE BALANCING THAT THEY'RE SEEING. IT IS THE STATE. IT IS THE STATE THE TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE. AND SO THIS MUST BE SHARED THE RESPONSIBILITY THE COST TO THE CONSUMER INCLUDING THE HARMS BECAUSE TO THEM. MUST BE SHARED THROUGH REQUIREMENTS THAT DAY BACK WHAT THEY'RE PUTTING ON THE ROAD. THE THING NOT GET A FREE. PASS IF THEY HAVE A DEVICE IS CATHING ON FIRE. THEY NOT BE ABLE TO WALK AWAY IF THEY'RE AT THE HANDLE BARS FALL OFF THE THING IN PEOPLE ARE HITTING THEIR HEADS ON THE PAVEMENT. I MEAN I'M I'M HANDLING THESE CASES. I HANDLE THE TNC CASES AND THANK GOD FOR THE INSURANCE OF THE OR THAT STATE WOULD BE HITTING SUCH A HIGH COST WITH PROVIDING. FOR THE CARE AND TREATMENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING INJURED. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO REGULATE. AND PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PUT IN THE FACT THEIR OWN SPECIFIC REGULATIONS. BUT THE STATE CANNOT ABDICATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF THE TONE. PLEASE ENTER THE COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR A START WITH CHAIR CHAIR FRAZIER RUNNING AND GOT A VICE CHAIR MORE LOCK. WITH A TO BE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS. RESEARCH. WITH A- BILL MISS RUBIO THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT WHEATON SO LET'S START WITH MR FRAZIER. WILL GO TO MISTER MOORE LOCK THEM UP AND GOING TO MISS RUBIO PLEASE CHEN FRAZIER THANK YOU MISTER- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TO LIMITED ACCESS CAN COMPARE OF LEE TO TEEN SEASON ONE NOT. FOR THE SCOOTERS. WITH THE ADVENT OF AB FIVE COMING IN JANUARY FIRST AND YOUR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO PICK UP IN CHARGE. PER UNIT. HOW THAT CAN AFFECT YOUR. BOTTOM LINE AS FAR AS TO THE CONSUMER NUMBER ONE AND THE FLEXIBILITY THE NIGHT YOU KNOW LOSE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE IT'S A GREAT QUESTION TO STAR IN MANY CITIES WE ALREADY EMPLOYED ON FULL TIME AND OR W. TO WORKERS- BE GIVEN LOCAL PERMIT REQUIREMENTS- IS AN EXAMPLE I THINK OF HOUSES SOME CITIES CAN PRIORITIZE- THEIR PARTICULAR WHAT THEY SEE AS MOST IMPORTANT. SECOND I THINK IS THAT OUR USE OF GIVE WORKERS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THAT OF AN UBER DRIVER AND UBER DRIVERS IN IN LARGE PART BECAUSE ARGUED WORKERS PRIMARILY PICK UP SCOOTERS ON THEIR WAY HOME FROM WORK WERE ON THEIR WAY TO WORK ON LONG THE WAY THERE ISN'T A THERE'S A DEVICE THAT NEEDS TO BE CHARGED THEY CAN PICK IT UP. BRING IT HOME CHARGES AND THEN ON THE WAY BACK TO WORK DROP IT OFF AGAIN IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN SOMEONE WHO RELIES ON IT WHO STRIVE WHO'S THAT HEADING AROUND ON THE SAN FRANCISCO STREETS ALL DAY. AND THIRD I THINK ON TO YOUR POINT IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IT DOES LIMIT OUR FLEXIBILITY I THINK THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS TO DO SO TO DOING SO NOW WE'VE EXPLORED LOCAL CITIES. AS THEY PROMULGATE. THEIR REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE LABOR THAT WE CAN HIRE. SHOW UP IN A TMELY MANNER BECAUSE IT WAS ADDRESSED. AND THERE WAS A COMPETITIVE NATURE THERE PUT HOW DOES THAT NOW CHANGE. THE CURRENTLY WE USE W. TO WORK FORCE WE USE A LOT OF STAFFING AGENCIES AND WE ALSO HAVE EMPLOYEES A RECORD WHERE WHERE THE EMPLOYER OF RECORD AND THAT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE. SO IT'LL BE. SAME THING. CATHERINE YOU'VE GOT NO EMPOWER HAVE ANY YEAH WE DON'T HAVE ANY W. TWO OR A TEN NINETY NINE WORKERS IN THE JUMPS SMOKER. AND FOR YOU SIR WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE- THE EFFORTS IN THE SAUSAGE MAKING COMPONENT OF THE TEENS HE'S- AS SENATOR BLL AND TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY ADDRESSING THE ADA- WE SEE. A LIMITED AMOUNT OF EFFORTS BEING PUT TOWARDS THE PARA TRANSIT COMPONENT. OF THE TEAM IN SEASON WONDER WHAT YOU SAW WHEN YOU WERE IN THIS COMPONENT LATE AT NIGHT. OF THE EFFORTS THAT MADE SURE THAT THERE WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY OF. THE EFFORTS MADE ON BEHALF OF THE CONSTITUTION THAT. RELATIVELY NOTHING YOU'RE ON NOTHING I'M SORRY SAY YOUR HONOR AND CECIL RECORD. OF THE PROMOTION BUT THANK YOU THERE IS SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO HANG OUT AND AS YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTION AS IT RELATED TO- COSTS IN IMPACTS AND NO TEN NINETY NINE WORKERS. I THINK WHAT THE COMMITTEE NEEDS TO% KNOW IS THAT HOW ARE THESE DEVICES MAINTAINED AND INSPECTED THE ART. THERE PICKED UP BY PEOPLE YOU SAW A PICTURE OF SOMEBODY WITH TEN SCOOTERS ON ON ON A BIKE THEY'RE BROUGHT HOME THEY'RE PLUGGED IN IN THOSE PEOPLE GET PAID PER SCOOTER. I DON'T THINK THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE TEN NINETY NINE I DOUBT THEIR W. TWOS BUT THEY'RE BEING PAID BUT THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO INSPECT OR MAINTAIN THESE DEVICES NOR IS THERE ANY SCHEDULE FOR DOING SO. SO YOU HAVE DEVICES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE BEING AS YOU HEARD THROWN ON THE SIDEWALK COST OVER FENCES THROWN INTO LAKES BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S IN ANY REGULATIONS REQUIRING ANY TYPE OF INSPECTION AND THEY GET A COMPLETE WAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY EVEN IF THEY DON'T. INSPECTOR MAINTAIN THEIR DEVICES. THANK YOU FOR THAT WHO ISN'T ME. UNDER MORE MONEY TO MISTER FOO FOR- BEING HERE I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS BUT KIND OF REVIEWING ALL THE MATERIAL- I GOT THE SENSE THAT. ARE JUMPING ON A SCOOTER IS SORT OF LIKE SNOW SKIING WHICH I'VE DONE FOR ABOUT. SIX DECADES BUT YOU HAVE. BEGINNER INTERMEDIATE EXPERTEN I'M JUST WONDERING. IF DO YOU GIVE. SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER WRITTEN ONE BEFORE WHO IS CAN BE A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT SPEED MEANS AND STOPPING AND ALL THE REST DO YOU GIVE THEM LIKE THE FIRST MYLAR TO FREEZE SO THEY CAN KIND OF. FIELD. A LITTLE MORE RELAXED ABOUT LEARNING HOW TO PROPERLY. FLOW WITH TRAFFIC FEDERAL AID I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S SOME SOMETHING EVEN BETTER THAN THAT THAT WE'RE WORKING ON ACTIVELY RIGHT NOW WHICH IS THE ON WHEN SOMEONE'S WHEN SOMEONE'S TAKING THEIR FIRST RIDE AN OPTION TO ENABLE WHAT WHAT YOU COULD CALL BEGIN REMOTE SAYS THAT YOU LIMIT YOUR ACCELERATION SPEED AND THEN RUN OPTION TO COULD KEEP IT ON IF YOU FEEL IF YOU FEEL IT'S NECESSARY OR TURN IT OFF- I THINK IT'S A IT'S A SIMPLE WAY I THINK THAT WERE WORKING ON TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE WHILE OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT WHICH IS THE ON YOUR VERY FIRST EXPERIENCE ARE OBVIOUSLY MORE LIKELY TO HAVE- HAVE AN INCIDENT ON. THAN AS A SEASONED PRO HOW STRICTER YOU ON THE WEIGHT REQUIREMENT I UNDERSTAND IT'S TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS OR LESS. THE IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S NOT AS THOUGH THERE'S A SENSOR WITHIN THE SCOOTER THAT WILL KICK YOU OFF OF YOUR OVER. OVER WAY I THINK THE WE I DON'T THINK I'M OVERWEIGHT. CERTAINLY CERTAINLY NOT SENATOR NO I'M. BUT A THE I JUST I JUST KIND OF I I'M- BY COULD LOSE SOME WEIGHT THANK YOU MISTER TRUE BUT- BY MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO USE YOUR SCOOTER AND I WAS KIND OF FEELING LEFT OUT. THE GOODBYE WITH. ARE YOU. AS SURE AS YOU'RE GROWING AS YOU'RE DEALING WITH ALL THESE MUNICIPALITIES STATES ARE ARE YOU COMING TO A- MAY BE AN INTERNAL. REALIZATION THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE SOME MINIMAL. LEVEL OF THE OF STANDARDIZATION FOR EVERYONE SO YOU'RE NOT DEALING WITH EVERY DIFFERENT CITY. EVERY EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK BUT IF WE HAD A MINIMUM STANDARD ARE YOU ARE YOU DEVELOPING THAT ARE YOU READY TO MAYBE PROVIDE SOMETHING THAT WOULD. RESOLVE A LOT OF THESE CONCERNS. CENTER MORE LIKE- TO BE TO BE HONEST YES I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT A LOT WHICH IS THAT THERE WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPERATIONAL KARMA SO ALL OF OUR CITIES. WE DON'T THINK THAT WE DON'T EXPECT TO EVER GET RID OF THAT WE PRICE THAT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERY CITY BE ABLE TO DETERMINE FOR ITSELF FOR INSTANCE THAT THE VENICE CANALS FOR INSTANCE ARE OFF LIMITS OR THIS OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD IS A NO PARKS ON. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THE STATE TO STEP IN WHERE I DO THINK IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE STATE TO SEVEN WILL BE ON ISSUES THAT RELATE TO. THE ADOPTION OF MY PROBABILITY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA MORE GENERALLY THAT AREN'T. NECESSARILY LOCALITY SPECIFIC. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS FOR COMING. THE QUESTION A THAT I'M INTERESTED IN IT IS I'M GONNA. IS GONNA COME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR ME. ABOUT THE AMERICAN DISABILITIES ACT AND WHETHER OR NOT HERE IS ANY ENFORCEABLE METHOD OR MECHANISM. TO PREVENT. DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE WITH JUST VARIOUS TYPES OF DISABILITIES AND THEN. THE CIVIL RIGHTS ASPECTS RELATES TO THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND WHERE YOU LIVE AND HOW YOU PROTECT FROM OF DISCRIMINATION. ESTáN LOCATION OF THESE THESE TRANSPORTATION DEVICES SO I I'M INTERESTED NON I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT YOUR OPINION IS ON HELMETS. SHOULD THEY BE REQUIRED IS THERE ANY KIND OF SAFETY STUDIES. OF SPECIAL WE USE PUBLIC FUNDS IN TERMS OF- IF IT'S A- PART OF THE MICRO MOBILITY. PARTNERSHIP WITH A PUBLIC AGENCY A TRANSIT AGENCIES SAY LIKE- LIKE IN SAN JOSE THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM LOCATED NEXT TO OUR- MALLS ARE TRAIN STATION HERE ALSO WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE GET OFF THE TRAIN THE HOP ON THOSE THINGS AND THEY GO. TO THE SAN JOSE STATE OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW A LOT OF ROOM FOR STUDENTS YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S WHAT. WHAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY. IT'S A ROOM. JUST GOING UP TO STREET TO SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY WHERE WE HAVE LIKE FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS SO AND- I'M IT I'M INTERESTED IN YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK. I THINK YOUR ARM. IT COULD BE A BENEFIT TO HAVE OF. YOU KNOW A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP TO AID PEOPLE IN TERMS OF TRANSPORTATION YES OF SUPPORT AT THE OTHER HAND. I DON'T SEE ANY EXCEPTIONS IN MY THINKING TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS. ASPECTS I CAN'T YOU KNOW HONESTLY WITH PUBLIC FUNDS THEY'RE JUST. THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN. REGULATE YOUR CONTROL YOU WITHOUT A KIND OF CIVIL RIGHTS. SUPPOSITION. THE CITY OF SAN JOSE AYE AYE A I WAS ON THE COUNCIL. I GOT ELECTED TO THE COUNCIL. AND A IBM OR REAR ACTUALLY REPLACE ME AS A MEMBER OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION I WAS A PLANNING COMMISSION FOR FOUR YEARS AGO ON A COUNCIL IN A WE APPOINTED A GENTLEMAN FROM- THE EVERGREEN AREA SAN JOSE'S NAME WAS FRANKLIN WEST. AND HIS SON IS NOW. SO I'M I'M KIND OF INTERESTED WITH FRANK WESS WOULD HAVE SET. ABOUT THE SUBJECT. AS ONE OF MY PLANNING COMMISSIONERS THAT I WORK WITH IN SAN JOSE IN THOSE DAYS- SO IT IS CAN YOU RESPOND TO THOSE QUESTIONS I'M VERY CURIOUS AS TO HOW YOU WOULD APPROACH THOSE ISSUES SURE- SO FOR THE RECORD I DON'T THINK WE CONSIDER OURSELVES AS EXAM FROM EIGHTY EIGHT WE DO A LOT TO RESPOND TO PARKING COMPLAINTS WERE WE MIGHT BE BLOCKING SIDEWALK OR OTHER AREAS OF ACHERAL ACCESS- WE DO THINGS LIKE RE BALANCE WE SEND PEOPLE OUT TO GRAB SKATERS HAVE BEEN MISS PARK TERM BIKES AT MYSTIC. BEEN MESSED PARKED- WE'VE INTEGRATED WITH THREE ONE ONE SO PEOPLE CAN CALL AND LEAVE NOTES WITH THE CITY OF THE PASS ALONG TO US- WE ALSO OF EXPERIMENTAL WITH OFFERING FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN THE FIRST PLACE PARK IN THE RIGHT SPOT WE SUPPORT THINGS LIKE LOCKED TO TECHNOLOGY. SO PEOPLE ARE IN FURNITURE DOWN THERE NOT THE MIDDLE THE RIGHT AWAY. THINGS LIKE EDUCATION. ALSO DOING THINGS LIKE FINANCIAL DISINCENTIVES FINES- AND THEN WE'RE DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY WE'RE DEVELOPING THINGS LIKE SIDEWALK DETECTION LOCALIZATION TECHNOLOGY WERE YOU ARE PARTNERING WITH CITIES ON THAT. BEING VERY TRANSPARENT THE LIKE. YOU KNOW JUST. STOP THEIR BLOCKING THE RAMPS ON THE SIDEWALKS. PUTTING THEM IN FRONT OF THE BUS STOPS YOU KNOW THE BUT YOU KNOW THE- THE TRANSIT AREAS WHERE PEOPLE WERE. TRYING TO GET ACCESS TO THE- ONE SOURCE OF MOBILITY WHICH IS THE PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE BECAUSE THEY'RE TRANSIT DEPENDENT SO THEY. YOU KNOW IF THERE IF THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY. POSSIBLE WAY THE DROPPED THE THINGS IN A CERTAIN LOCATION HONOR IS OUR WAY OF. DINNER FIND THE CULPRITS THE. YOU KNOW DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD TO ME WOULD BE A CAN TO SOMEBODY PARKING AND- DISABLED PARKING SPACE IT ALSO YOU KNOW YOU ARE MADE A SORT OF A DISABILITY ACT I I'M I'M KIND OF LIKE I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS BUT I THINK. I WANT TO FIGURE IT OUT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT OPINIONS OR. NO I WE WANT TO SHARE WE WANT TO FIGURE IT OUT ALONG WITH YOU ALONG WITH OUR CITY PARTNERS AND I THINK THEY'RE AT THIS STAGE THERE ISN'T ANY ONE RIGHT ANSWER I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF- LOCALIZE AND THERE'S JUST ISN'T A ONE SIZE FITS ALL ANSWER RIGHT. NOW IF I MAY. ABOUT GEO FENCING JUST AWHILE AGO REMEMBER HEARING ABOUT THAT SERGIO FENCING MEANS YOU CAN SET UP A BORDER AROUND CERTAIN AREAS TO MONITOR THE ACTIVITY THERE IS A POSSIBILITY TO REQUIRE THAT THE SCOOTER IN ORDER TO END THE RIDE BE PUT WITHIN A GEO FENCED AREA IN SAN FRANCISCO WE SEE THESE LYING ON THE GROUND AND WE SEE ELDERLY PEOPLE HAVING AND NAVIGATE THEM AND TRIP OVER THEM. THERE LEFT RANDOMLY AT THE RAMPS WERE THE HANDICAPPED PEOPLE HAVE TO GET UP AND DOWN THE BIRD I THINK IT IS IF IT FALLS OVER ON ITS SIDE IT BEEPS SO THERE'S A WAY THAT THEY MAY KNOW AND DE THAT THROUGH THEIR OWN TECHNOLOGY IS THE THING ON THE SIDE BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE IS A WAY TO ADDRESS THE ADA ISSUES ARE STOCKS. BUT THERE COULD BE NO THIS LIKE THE FIRST IS THE COVERED BUT STOPS WHERE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO GET AND THEY HAVE SPOTS FOR PEOPLE THE WHEEL THEMSELVES IN A WAY FOR THEIR BUS. AND THEN I SEE WHERE THE. WHAT IS THE PARK THEY JUST DON'T THESE THINGS AND- IT SHOULD JUST TO ME I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WOULD DO THAT YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE BUT- IT HAPPENS YOU KNOW SO. THAT'S I AM THIS IS DISTURBING OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH SOONER BUT I THINK THE HAVE BEEN KEEPING TRACK ON FILE IF YOU TO FOLLOW UP HERE IN ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT CENTER BELL AND AS SOON FRASIER'S BUT EVEN FOCUSING IN ON IS OF ONE EXCESS ABILITY. ON THE DEVICES INTO ENSURING THAT PUBLIC SPACES ARE FREE AND CLEAR OF- ANY POTENTIAL CHIP HAZARDS OR BLOCKING ACCESS OR MOBILITY SO WE HAVE THAT IS A. ONE BOLDED FOLLOW UP ITEM SUGGEST VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO BE TO TURN IT OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI CINNAMON FORESHORES. YOU'RE JUST A TWO QUESTIONS QUICKLY FIRST FOR MISTER DOLE AND I'M JUST CURIOUS SO WHEN I RIDE. MY BIKE WHICH GOES A LOT FASTER. THAN A SCOOTER CAM. IF I RIDE MY HORSE WHO'S A LOT BIGGER GOES FASTER AND IS MUCH STUPIDER THAN A SCOOTER I DON'T HAVE TO WEAR A HELMET BY LAW. ON EITHER OF THOSE CASES SO I'M JUST CURIOUS I UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE OF HEAD INJURIES FROM A SCOOTER SURVIVE BY USED ONE I MEAN IRA WHICH IS THE HOME OF MY WORSE I ALWAYS USE IT ON A BIKE I. I DON'T KNOW IF I ISN'T AS GOOD OR NOT- BUT LEGALLY I DON'T HAVE TO AND THOSE OTHER TWO. THAT TYPES OF MOBILITY AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY HEAD INJURIES WITH THOSE TWO SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHY YOU KEEP COMING BACK. TO THE HELMET ISSUE. IS IT BECAUSE YOU THINK THEY'RE MORE DANGEROUS ARE MORE PRONE THAN BICYCLES TO HEAD INJURIES OR IS IT BECAUSE THEY'RE RENTALS AND YOU THINK THAT SOMEHOW. THAT SHOULD COMPEL PEOPLE. ADULTS TO WEAR HELMETS EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE TO. ON BICYCLES OR OTHER TYPES OF DEVICES. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. YOU ON YOUR HORSE YOU ON YOUR BIKE. YOU KNOW HOW THAT THEIR MAINTAINED YOU KNOW HOW THE HORSES FED WHETHER IT'S LAME. YOU WATCH YOUR BIKE YOU INSPECT YOUR BIKE. THEREFORE YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER YOUR BIKE. I WAS A MOTORCYCLIST UNTIL I HAD A CATASTROPHIC MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT SIX YEARS AGO. STATE OF CALIFORNIA REQUIRED ME TO WEAR A HELMET. THE REASON BEING THERE IS A GREATER PROPENSITY FOR INJURY TO MY HEAD. BY USING THAT FORM OF TRANSPORTATION. THESE SCOOTERS HAVE VERY SMALL WHEELS. YOUR BICYCLE HAS A LARGE WHEEL. WHEN YOU GO OVER A CRACK IN PAVEMENT- A POTHOLE. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE THROWN FROM YOUR BICYCLE BECAUSE THERE'S A GREATER AREA OF SURFACED IT'S TOUCHING THE GROUND OKAY SO YOU. YOU THINK THAT THE SCOOTERS THAN THAT THERE'S DATA THAT THEY ARE INHERENTLY. MORE UNSTABLE OR MORE DANGEROUS AND I I'VE I'VE ACTUALLY HEARD THE SAME THING SO I'M NOT ARGUING WITH YOU. BUT SO IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM BEING A RENTAL NECESSARILY THAT YOU THINK THAT THEY ARE. MORE DANGEROUS THAN A BICYCLE AND THEREFORE MORE. THERE SHOULD BE. SORT OF HIGHER SAFETY STANDARDS. FOR THE USER THAT'S CORRECT. AND YOU THINK IF YOU OWN YOUR- YOUR SCOOTER YOU SHOULD ALSO HAVE TO WEAR A HELMET. PERSONALLY YES. OKAY THIS BECAUSE MY ARMY GOT IT. I THANK YOU MY NEXT QUESTION IS FOR. THE TWO OF YOU. SO WE'VE HEARD A LOT FROM THE CITIES THAT WERE HERE ABOUT THEIR NEED. TO HAVE DATA ABOUT TRIPS. AND HAVING BEEN IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT I THINK THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THEY CAN'T PLAN. SCOOTERS THEY CAN'T REGULATE THEM THEY CAN'T DO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TIE THEM IN WITH- THEIR TRANSIT AND MAKE THEM USEFUL WITHOUT HAVING VERY SPECIFIC DATA ABOUT WHERE PEOPLEARE TAKING THEM AND WHEN THEY'RE USING THEM. AND YET YOU HAVE FOUGHT THE EFFORTS FOR ME AND FROM OTHERS TO HAVE THAT KIND OF DATA PROVIDED TO THE CITIES. SO WHERE IS THAT LINE FOR YOU WHAT DO YOU THINK IS REASONABLE TO BE SHARED WITH THE CITIES. OF WHO RIGHT NOW ARE UNABLE TO DO THE PLANNING THAT THEY NEED TO DO- TO MAKE THAT TEIR CONGESTION BETTER TO TIE THEIR TRANSPORTATION AND WITH. WITH WHAT YOU SAY IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE USE OF YOUR PRODUCT WHICH IS TO SOLVE FIRST MILE LAST MILE TO SOLVE TRANSPORTATION. THERE'D BE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET THAT DATA. ARE FROM YOU INCIDENT LARGE CITIES MIGHT BE ABLE TO. TO LEVERAGE- GETTING THE DATA FROM YOU ON THEIR OWN BUT THE SMALLER CITIES CANNULAS HELL NO WE'RE NOT GIVING IT YOU WOULD JUST ONE OPERATE. SO WHAT IS THE LINE FOR YOU HOW MUCH DATA SHOULD YOU BE REQUIRED UNDER THE LAW TO PROVIDE TO THE TUNE TO ME TOO FOR CITIES TO BE ABLE TO REGULATE PROPERLY. AND TO- GET THE BEST OUT OF YOUR SERVICE AS POSSIBLE. THANK HANK YOU SIMPLY WOMAN- I THINK IT WAS PROFESSOR BUT TO SAY THAT MENTIONED THAT SEVERAL OTHER STATES HAD ALREADY DRAFTED THIS- OUT OF KIND OF SHOW FRAMEWORK. AND PROUD TO SAY THAT THAT WAS WITH A LOT OF INPUT FROM US AS TO WHAT THE APPROPRIATE LINE SHOULD BE TO WHAT IS WHAT IS THE LINE BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH YOU ON. FOR A YEAR NOW ON THIS AND I HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT FROM YOU I'VE GOTTEN AS- A LOT OF- CONCERN FROM YOUR TECH COMPANIES. ABOUT PRIVACY WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT IRONIC- BUT% THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT OF THAT WITH YOU KNOW CITIES HAVE NO RIGHT TO HAVE ANY OF THIS AND THEY- THEY COULD. DO SOMETHING VERY NEFARIOUS IF THEY HAD THE DATA AND YET WE HAVE CITIES TELLING US. THAT THEY CAN'T SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE DATA SO I'D I'D LIKE TO KNOW FROM YOU WHAT IS THAT BRIGHT WHAT IS THAT LINE. I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE BRIGHT LINE IS THAT CITIES ABSOLUTELY HAVE A RIGHT TO THE DATA FROM OUR DEVICES ON THEIR STREETS. AT THE SAME TIME OF COURSE THERE ARE PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS THAT RELATE FROM OUR WRITERS AND THE DEVICES THAT THEY WRITE ON. BUT THAT THAT THOSE TWO GOALS ARE NOT INCOMPATIBLE IN THAT WITH THE APPROPRIATE DATA PRIVACY GOVERNANCE STANDARDS THAT IS TO SAY ONCE THE CITY RECEIVES THE DATA THEY ARE SUBJECT TO SOME OF THE SAME DATA PRIVACY CENTERS THAT WE ARE. THAT WE DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH THAT KIND OF THAT LEVEL DATA SHARING. YES WE WOULD ECHO THAT TRIP DATA IS PERSONAL DATA. WE DRAW THE LINE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE DATA BEING SURE THAT'S ANONYMIZED AN AGGREGATED. AND THAT CAN SOLVE ALL OF THE THINGS THAT GOVERNMENT WANTS TO DO ALL THE LEGITIMATE REGULATORY GOALS. THIS IS NOT TO STOP THOSE LEGITIMATE REGULATORY GOALS IS TO PROTECT DATA PRIVACY. PRESS CONSUMER PRIVACY WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT UNDER THE LAW. WHAT ABOUT THE DATA OF WHERE THE SCOOTERS ARE WHEN THERE'S NO ONE ON IT. TO THE PEOPLE TO BE ENTITLED TO. THAT OF ALL TIME SO THAT THEY KNOW WHERE ALL YOUR SCOOTERS ARE- THEY KNOW IF THEY'RE BLOCKING THE DRIVEWAY OR HANDICAP SPOT. YES THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRIP DATA AND DEVICE DADDO. DEVICE THAT IS THE OPERATIONAL DATA THAT WOULD ALLOW CITIES TO COMPLETE THE REGULATORY MISSIONS. TO SEE WHAT IS IN THEIR- JURISDICTION. MEET OUR REGULATORY CAPS THINGS-LIKE THAT. THE AGGREGATE BUT NOT AGGREGATED SO MUCH THAT THEY DON'T KNOW. EXACTLY WHERE THEY'RE GOING. AND SORT OF WHEN THEY'RE GOING RIGHT. CORRECT THE WEEKEND IS A LIGHTLY AGGREGATED DATA. LATELY AGGREGATE LIGHTLY AGGREGATED ENOUGH TO DRAW INSIGHTS. AND VERY FOR YOU KNOW. GET DOWN TO. CERTAIN GRANULARITY WITHOUT. WHERE YOU'RE NOW STEPPING IN VIOLATING USER PRIVACY IS WE FELT THAT WE- HAD THAT IN OUR BILL. AND YET YOU WERE STILL OPPOSED. TO MAYBE NOT RIGHT NOW BUT YOU CAN TELL US- YOU KNOW. WHERE THAT LINE IS. WE'LL BE HAPPY TO SHARE AND FOLLOW UP AND LIKE WE SAID THAT WE REALLY ENCOURAGE THE FULL COMMITTEE TO DIVE INTO THIS ISSUE I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE PLANNING TO. NEXT YEAR IT'S A VERY. THANK YOU TECHNICAL ISSUE. THANK YOU SO MUCH ISN'T EVER. GOING TO GO TO MR MASUCCI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER DOLE AND YOU HIGHLIGHTED THE ISSUE. OF MANY OF THESE. MOBILITY DEVICE PROVIDERS HAVING- CONTRACTUAL LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY. I HAVE A. TAKE BY ONE ASKED THE REPRESENTATIVE A BIRD IS IT IS IT I AM I CORRECT IN UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU- THAT BIRD DOES NOT HAVE SUCH A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WE DON'T KERRY. FOR AS- JUMP WHICH IS PROVIDED BY UBER- YOU DO HAVE THE CONTRACTUAL- LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH IS MURATSUCHI THE AND THAT WAS GONNA BE MY NEXT QUESTION IS SAID- TO LOOKING AT IN ISSUE IN REGARDS TO LIABILITY AND I THINK THAT'S- GOING TO BE AN ONGOING CONCERN ESPECIALLY AT THAT. ARTIFICIALLY LOW THRESHOLD RIGHT UNDERSTAND THAT MAY BE GOOD FOR THE COMPANY BUT- THERE ARE GONNA BE CHALLENGES FOR THE CONSUMERS AND THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK OUT- AS WE MOVE FORWARD. CLICK BACK TO WHERE- AND I'M NOT GOING TO DO A DEEP DIVE ON THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE. A DATE A HEARING COMING UP. AFTER THE FIRST PART OF THE YEAR. BUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO WHERE THE GENERAL MANAGER FROM. LOS ANGELES. WAS AT. I IN REGARDS TO SIX POINTS. AND ON. THE INDIVIDUAL- TRIP. BECAME TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE TRIP WAS COMPLETED. IS THAT AN ISSUE. ON THE SIX POINTED SHOULD MENTION I THINK THAT LOOK- UNDERSTAND WE ALL ANT TO BE ABLE TO GO IN TO BE TO PROTECT PRIVACY RIGHT AND OBVIOUSLY THERE NEED TO BE SOME TYPE OF PRIVACY AGREEMENT AS THERE ARE NOW RIGHT SO IT'S NOT TO BE- OUT IN THE PUBLIC. SPHERE BUT ALSO TRYING TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST CITY SO. ON THOSE SIX POINTS. THAT YOU HEARD TODAY. THAT SEEM REASONABLE SINCE IT'S ALREADY IN UNDER AGREEMENT ANYWAY. IT DOES I IN I THINK THAT WHAT PART OF THE- PART OF IN MY RESPONSE TO US TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN'S EMPHASIS WAS THAT WE CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE DATA AFTER THE CITY GETS THE AFTER THE CITY GETS IT IS IT- SUBSTITUTE IS THIS SOMETHING THAT IS PROTECTED IS A SOMETHING THE SUBJECT TO FOIL OR OPEN RECORDS REQUESTS OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT IS ESSENTIALLY AT AS ESSENTIALLY UNPROTECTED.WE'VE UNFORTUNATELY HAD NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES WITH OTHER CITIES NONE OF THE CITIES ON THIS PANEL OF COURSE IT HAD NATIVE EXPENSES ELSEWHERE AND THAT'S OUR PRIMARY FOCUSED CAN I GET AND I AND I GUESS I DON'T SEE WHY IT CAN'T BE TREATED LIKE FOR EXAMPLE CITY STREET BED TAX FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT. SO BY TAX IS NOT UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST YOU CAN'T REQUESTED BY CITIES GIVE IT OUT AS ONE LARGE TOTAL ON A QUARTERLY BASIS FOREVER THEY REPORTED BUT THEY DON'T. GO INDIVIDUAL BY INDIVIDUAL SO I. I JUST KNOW THERE'S A SWEET SPOT IN THERE TO BE ABLE TO. FIGURE THAT OUT. PLEASE MA'AM YEAH I WOULD JUST TRY TO. TURNED OUT IF THERE'S A SPECTRUM BETWEEN YOU KNOW FULL SELF REGULATION WHICH I THINK-WAS. A DISCUSSED EARLIER AND THEN WHERE WE'RE AT WITH REAL TIME TRIP INFORMATION I THINK THERE'S A NICE MIDDLE GROUND. IN THERE WERE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ALL THE GOALS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED TODAY THAT WE SUPPORT- BUT THEN DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S PRIVACY PROTECTED THAT'S AGGREGATED THAT'S ANONYMIZE AND WE CAN AND JUST FOR A LIMITED THOSE OTHER CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT USER PRIVACY. CARD AND AGAIN I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE SOMEONE INNOCENT WOMEN FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO BE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEES RIGHT. BECAUSE THEY HAD BILLS THAT WERE GOING THEY HAD BILLS THAT PASSED THE ASSEMBLY AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS. TO TRY TO- REALLY WORK THAT OUT IN TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT SO I'M WE'RE JUST ONE SEE HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE ONCE AGAIN. ANOTHER ITEM IN REGARDS TO MANDATED MINIMUMS FOR INSURANCE. YOU LOOK AT THE LARGER. CITIES. SIMILAR IN NATURE CAN I GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT WHAT YOU SEE OUT THERE IN THE MARKET PLACE IN CALIFORNIA. YES SO WE HAVE- I HAVE TWO COMMENTS ON THAT FRONT- WE MEET ALL OF THE YOU KNOW. LOCAL STATE. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- INSURANCE REGULATIONS- WE'VE NO CONCERNS WITH THAT THERE'S SOME THAT ARE BAKED INTO OUR PERMIT TERMS- WE ASSESS THOSE WHEN WE ARE APPLYING AND INTEND TO LIVE UNDER THOSE- THE CHALLENGES WHEN A POLICY BEING ASKED TO. GO OUT AND GET A POLICY DOESN'T EXIST ON THE MARKET TODAY. I WOULD FLAG THAT IS A CONCERN AND ANOTHER ONE IS. ARE THE MECHANISMS THAT LIKE IT WHAT'S IN THE BILL IS THAT ACTUALLY LEAING THE CONCERN THAT YOU HAVE SO LOOKING AT WHAT THE GOALS ARE SO WE HAVE A REALLY BROAD COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE WE HAVE A TEN MILLION DOLLAR. GET LIMIT WE HAVE A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PER CURRENTS LIMIT THAT MEETS. THE RIVER ON MANY OF THEIR BOB. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU HEARD TODAY- AND SO WE JUST DON'T WANT TO GET. TO WHERE WERE KIND OF SO BOXED IN THAT WERE IN KIND OF MISSING WHAT THE GOALS OF WHAT THE REGULATIONS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. DO YOU BELIEVE- THERE'S A COMMENT MADE THAT IF THERE WAS SAID AS STATEWIDE STANDARD RIGHT I THAT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY ASSIST IN REGARDS TO THE NUMBER. OF COMPANIES THAT WERE OFFERING INSURANCE AS WELL YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE- IN AND I'M GOING TO PARAPHRASE HERE AND WANT TO PUT WORDS INTO THE INDIVIDUALS MOUTH BUT- IT. THE COMMENT WAS THAT IF WE LOOK AT A STATEWIDE STANDARD THAT MAY BECOME. MORE OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHER COMPANIES APPEAR TO GET IN VERSES OUT ONE INSURANCE CARRIER AND IT CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE CAN YOU CAN. COME IN ON THE ACT. BUT YOU HEARD FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I TINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY LIKELY TO BE THE CASE A FEW STATES HAVE ALREADY PASSED SUCH IT SUCH STATEWIDE INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVEN'T SEEN AGREE UP TO GET ONE FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE. OTHERS ACTIVELY LOOKING TO GET INTO THE SPACE AS WELL. SORRY THAT THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT AS AS IS THE CASE FOR MOST. MOST COMPANIES IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE A SEPARATE INSURANCE POLICY FOR EVERY CITY IN WHICH WE OPERATE. AND SO THE REASON WHY WE SUPPORT THE CENTER'S IDEATION OF THESE CHARTS APARTMENTS AS WITH THE CITIES. IS THAT- IT WOULD IT WOULD BEHOOVE ANYONE TO HAVE ONE CITIES CREE INSURANCE REQUIREMENT THAT EVERY OTHER CITY IN CALIFORNIA NOW ESSENTIALLY HAS TO FALL. PLEASE AND I'M GONNA GO ALONG THE LINES THAT WITH MY TRADITIONAL STAFF FOR A RESPONSE WHICH IS YOU KNOW SUPPORT THE GOALS- WE HAVE TO SEE THE DETAILS OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE LAWYER IN ME AS I CAN BE ABLE TO SAY YES WE JUST CAN SUPPORT- BUT- THE GOALS YES. ARE LAUDABLE AND WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSED TO SEE REGULATION BUT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PREEMPT. LOCALS FROM GETTING IN AND HAVING VALID CONCERNS EITHER SO ON MAKE THAT POINT. IS MIDDLE. THANK YOU WE HEARD THE SAME ARGUMENT DURING THE TNC IS AN INSURANCE COMMISSIONER DAVE JONES- THEN WORK WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THE CREATED A WHOLE NEW MARKET OF INSURANCE. INCLUDING WHAT WE'RE NOW HEARING ON TV CALL METRO MILE THAT SUPPLIED BEYOND THE TNC IS TO PERSONS WERE USING IT WITH THEIR OWN VEHICLES. THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING INSURANCE COMPANIES TO COME IN AND UNDER RIGHT. THE UBER LIFT DRIVERS. I DON'T SEE THAT THERE WOULD BE SUCH A DIFFICULTY NOW BECAUSE THERE'S A MODEL TO FOLLOW. PLEASE IF I COULD I THINK THERE IS THE VERY SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IS SIMPLY THAT CAR INSURANCE FOR UBER UBER LET'S AT AS MY UNDERSTANDING- DEPLOY A VARIANT OF THE CAR INSURANCE THAT ALREADY EXISTS AND THERE WERE CERTAINLY A LOT OF- DREW A LOT OF NEW THING YOU ASPECTS OF IT THAT THEY HAD TO SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH THE INSURANCE COMES TO DO SO AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THAT- IN THE COMING YEAR TO DEVELOP THE SURE CENTERS FOR THIS VERY NEW MODE FOR WHICH THERE ISN'T REALLY ANY A CURRENT ANALOG AND WE'RE MEETING WITH. AND WE'RE MEETING ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THEM RIGHT NO. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WOULD LIKE TO BE ETERNAL RICHARD FRAZIER UP FOR ANOTHER QUESTION PLEASE JUST A- MOMENT UBER AND- PER TO KIND OF COMMENT ON THE LAST FEW WEEKS WE'VE BEEN HAVING THESE BLACKOUTS IN. OUR SHUT OFFS. HAVE YOU SEEN A DECLINE IN THE USAGE OF YOUR SCOOTERS AND THE AND THEN ALSO- THE ABILITY TO CHARGE HIM HELLO. FOR USAGE HAVE USED CONTRACTING MATT. SIR CERTAINLY IT IS CERTAINLY THE CHALLENGE FOR US AS IS AS IS AS EVERYONE ELSE THAT DEPENDS ON THE POWER GRID OF FOUR USES I KNOW THAT IN A FEW CITIES WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE UNLOCKED- AS AN OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN. EXISTENCE CIRCUMSTANCES TO USE FREE OF CHARGE TO GET OUT OF WHERE THEY NEED TO BE IS- AS AS A POTENTIAL OPTION BUT CERTAINLY YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE BLACKOUTS AND THE AND THE WILD FIRES HAVE. TAKEN THEIR TOLL ON US AS THEY DO THE REST OF CALIFORNIA. I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC DATA ABOUT HOW THE WILD FIRES OF AFFECTED SERVICE OTHER THAN WE HAVE DONE SAFETY MESSAGING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO. YOU KNOW USE MIKE MOBILITY OPTIONS AND IN TE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. WE HAVE THE WILD FIRES ARE HAPPENING- BUT NOT SURE ABOUT THAT AND- THE- IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR POWER GRAD CHARGING AT OPERATIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I WOULD JUST BE CURIOUS ON HOW MUCH. OF PEOPLE THAT RELY ON THEM ON A DAILY BASIS- HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND HOW. ARE YOU THE REDUCTION OF USAGE HAS. NOT ONLY AFFECTED YOU. THE CONSUMER BUT ALSO A YOUR BOTTOM LINE. I HAVE A FOLLOW UP AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY SPECIFICS WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU. THANK YOU. ONE LESS ITEM A PROMISE AND THEN I WILL TURN IT OVER TO- THE CHAIRMAN FOR CLOSING COMMENTS AS WELL. CAN WE GO BACK SO- HE HE ALL COMMENTED ON ISSUES IN REGARDS TO PC FEES AND LOCAL FEES AS WELL. I THINK THAT IT IS A REAL CHALLENGE IS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TRYING TO RECOUP THE COSTS THAT IT TAKES TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE PROGRAM. SO WALK US THROUGH THAT ONE MORE TIME- IF YOU DON'T MIND THAT BECAUSE I THINK WITH THE CHALLENGES. OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT JUST COULD BE CANTON I'LL GIVE YOU MY OWN EDITORIAL. I THINK THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS SWAMPED. I THINK THAT- TO SAY THE LEAST. THEY NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME REGULATING P. JEANNIE LESS TIME ON THIS AND THAT THE LOCALS TO WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. MY OWN OPINION WE WILL GO THERE WE WILL SURPASS RAN A CUSS JAR. SO. BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS. IF THERE COULD BE SOME ROOM. REGION GREEN OF THOSE DOLLARS THAT COULD GO TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HELP THEM SINCE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE ON THE GROUND THERE REGULATING. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE- I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE GETTING WHAT YOU NEED AT THIS POINT. THE P. C. ON THIS ISSUE. SOME OF OUR THANK YOU SO MUCH- I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THAT WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HAVE ANY PUBLIC WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC SUPPORT WE DON'T RELY ON IT HOWEVER AS A RESULT OF THAT AS A RESULT OF CITIES- RECOUPING THE COSTS WHICH WILL WHICH AS SOMEONE WHO HAS ALSO. HAD EXPERIENCE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE IN YET ANOTHER LARGE RED ITEM ON YOUR BUDGET. I THINK THE PROBLEM FOR US COMES IN THE FACT THAT THIS IS AN APPLIED EQUALLY ACROSS TRANSPORTATION MODES THE FEES THAT WE PAY FOR DRIVING CARS OR FOR TAKING ON TNC TRIPS OR FOR ANY OTHER MODE OF TRANSPORT DON'T REALLY COME CLOSE TO MATCHING THE COST OF ALL THE TRANSPORTATION STAFFERS THAT CITIES HIGHER THE TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION AND SO ON. THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING THAT TO SOME EXTENT THIS IS SUBSIDIZED BY THE REST OF THE PUBLIC IN IN AFFORDABLE TO ALLOW ALL OF US TO GET AROUND. I THINK THAT WHAT WE SWITCH SCENE THAT I CON ME IN WHEN IT COMES TO CITIES RECOUPINGTHE COSTS COMING TO US IS THAT THOSE COSTS ARE TWENTY TO EIGHTY TIMES HIGHER THAN THE COSTS IMPOSED ON DNC'S AND THAT THIS NOT BECAUSE CITIES ARE OUT ON ARE OUT TRYING TO RAISE REVENUE OR TRYING TO EXTORT ANYBODY IT'S SIMPLY THAT WE ARE WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW MOST THAT THERE IS A- THERE'S ACTIVE ATTEMPT TO TRY TO RECOUP ALL THE COSTS. AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ASPECTS WERE I THINK HAVING STATE MARCIA WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL IN THAT THE STATE HAS CONTRIBUTED A LOT TOWARDS ENCOURAGING THE ADOPTION OF ZERO MISSION TRANSPORTATION AND THAT IS EXACTLY THE SORT OF THING. THAT WOULD BENEFIT MOST I THINK. FROM LOWERING THE COST UPON WRITERS. GOT IT OKAY IN I THINK THAT- I APPRECIATE AND I THINK THE ISSUE IS. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. WE WANT TO DO THIS HEARING TODAY IS. AS WE SEEN. WHETHER IT'S ISSUES EIGHTEEN C. OR ISSUES. AGAIN OF CANNABIS RIGHT. WE ALLOW INDUSTRIES AGO AND THEN WE TRY TO BE A RELIGION OVERSEEN CHALLENGES. TRYING TO BE TO DO IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME ALL AT ONCE. SO I APPRECIATE THAT IS WELL- IN THAT INSIGHT- WOULD LIKE TO BE TO LOOK FOR ANY CLOSING COMMENTS FROM THE THREE PEOPLE CERTAIN SHOULD OWN GO TO OUR RIGHT- AND THEN WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP FOR THE PUBLIC. PLEASE DON'T CLOSE INCOMING PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION THE CPUC DOES NOT REGULATE SCOOTERS. TN CZS SCOOTERS NO- WHAT I DO WANNA IT STRESSED AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY IS THAT THE CONSUMER CAN'T COME LAST. IN THE BILL CAN'T BE FOOTED BY THE CITY OR MEDI CAL. THERE MUST BE SOME APPORTIONMENT AS IS THE STANDARD THROUGH LAW AND ECONOMICS. ALL THROUGHOUT TIME. IF A PRODUCT A PRODUCT IS BEING SOLD IT MUST INCORPORATE THE TRUE COSTS OF THE PRODUCT. OTHERWISE THE MARKET WILL NOT. SET THE RIGHT POINT IN WHICH IS TO BE USED TO THE RIGHT COST. THIS MUST INCLUDE THE COST OF INJURIES TO PERSONS. THERE SHOULD NOT AND CANNOT BE A COMPLETE RELEASE AND WAIVER. OF ALL LIABILITY FOR SOMEONE WHO USES THIS DEVICE THAT THEY'RE NOT MAINTAINING. INSPECTING OR REALLY HAVING ANY CONTROL OVER OTHER THAN TAKING A PROFIT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CALLING US. I WOULD SAY REAL TIME COLLECTION TRIP DETAIL DATA IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO CONSUMER PRIVACY. IT'S ALSO THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE DIRECTION A CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN. ON PRIVACY ISSUES- ESPECIALLY WHEN ALL THE LEGITIMATE REGULATORY GOALS THAT WE DISCUSSED HERE TODAY LIKE MONITORING CAPS UTILIZATION AND DISTRIBUTION CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT TRACKING INDIVIDUAL WRITERS. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. EXCEPT FOR WHEN WE DO THINK SO MUCH FOR. AND I WOULD AND I WOULD AGREE THAT THE CONSUMER DOESN'T. FIRST I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT THAT IT THAT. MATTERS TO CONSUMERS ALONG WITH MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE SO. AND SAFE AND PROTECTED ON ON OUR DEVICES. BUT THIS AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE WANT TO PRESERVE CHOICE OF PEOPLE CHOOSING BETWEEN CARS AND OTHER MODES. IN THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S THE EXISTING LOCAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS AND THE STATE REGULATORY FROM A FOR CALIFORNIA. GREATLY INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO TAKE CARS INSTEAD OF SCOOTERS AND BIKES IN THAT IF WE WANT TO FIX THAT BUT THE ANSWER ISN'T TO GET RID OF LOCAL REGULATION BEFORE THE CITY'S. FOR US THE WRITERS AND THE STATE. TO ALL WORK TOGETHER. TOO MUCH. EXCELLENT PANEL WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT ALL THE WOULD HANG WITH US TODAY- IN YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME IN YOUR BUSY SCHEDULES. RESIDENT NORTH BAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP DURING THIS- FIRE SEASON I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN BOOTSON THE GROUND OUT THERE. AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FROM OUR COMMUNITY SO I THINK SO MUCH HAS DAHLE AND IT'S BEEN A- ROUGH COUPLE WEEKS SO VERY VERY GRATEFUL AND I WILL PASS THAT ALONG TO EVERYONE UP THERE THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE NOT GONNA BE OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE'RE GONNA ASSET EACH INDIVIDUAL BE ABLE TO SAY THE FIRST AND LAST NAME WE WELCOME YOU. HERE THREE MINUTES SIR THANK YOU FOR HANGING WITH US AND FOR YOUR PATIENCE- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU YOU HAVE THE FLOOR SIR. THREE MINUTES. HELLO SENATOR. FIRE CENTERED RUBIO AS ASSEMBLYMAN FRAZIER- WHAT I WILL OFFER TO YOU IS FIRST THING IS TO PAGE SEVEN. THE EIGHTY EIGHTY I ONLY HAVE A CALIFORNIA INSURANCE CARD. IDENTIFICATION SO I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE THOSE SYSTEMS BECAUSE IT MANDATES THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE WHICH IS WHAT YOU WILL HAVE IN MOST PEOPLE OF DISABILITY QUALIFICATIONS WHAT YOU NEED TO FIGURE IS A PATH I THINK IT'S A CLASS THAT NEEDS TO BE OFFERED IN FULL INSTRUCTION ABILITY SO THAT YOU UTILIZE. THESE MEANS BECAUSE I WATCH THE JUMP BIKES IN SACRAMENTO SEE HOW BADLY DAMAGED THEY ARE THE STORY OF THE TWO SHOWS TWENTY NINTH STREET I WATCH SOMEBODY TAKE A JUMP BIKE AND JUST PLOP RIGHT DOWN IN THE PEDESTRIAN CROSSWALK AND LEAVE IT THERE I ASKED THEM TO MOVE NO WAY THIS GOES BACK TO THE COMPANY. SO I WILL SAY TO YOU IS WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. IS JUMPED PARKS AARON SCOOTERS NEED TO BE WHERE THEY START OUT GPS FIVE OR TEN MINUTES WHEN THEY'RE FINISHED IS RECORDED ANY NEED TO HAVE A PLACE FROM TO BE PICKED UP AND A PLACE FOR THEM TO BE DROPPED OFF LOT OF PEOPLE HERE IN SACRAMENTO HAVE TO GO THROUGH TRYING TO FIND ON A MAP WERE IN THE WORLD THEY ARE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE OTHER CITIES ARE LIKE. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING FOR BOTH UBER AND LIFT ALSO IS WHERE THEY TRY AND PICK UP PEOPLE IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IF YOU CAME UP WITH BEST PRACTICES IN LOOKED AT WHAT WORKS IN THE STATE AND IN THE CITIES AND COME UP WITH COMMONALITY AGREEMENTS ALSO PROBABLY MAYBE IT'S THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING OR SOMETHING THAT EVERY SINGLE DEVICE THAT THESE COMPANIES MAINTAIN THAT YOU CAN GPS SETTING. SEE YOU KNOW WHAT THE HECK WHERE THEY ARE THAT'S NOT ANYTHING PRIVACY OR ANYTHING ELSE BUT YOU HAVE A CLUE NO WAY IN AND SO YOU HAVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS TO BE ADDRESSED. AND I WILL OFFER FOR DISABLED YES THEY'RE ALWAYS IN MY WAY IN SACRAMENTO I DO HAVE TO KEEP BROWN AND MOVE THEM- DEXTER HAD I'M WORRIED RIGHT NARAL TO KILLING YOU ABOUT THIS. BUT AGAIN I THINK IF YOU DO THOSE THINGS YOU WILL GET THEM SO THAT DOES MEAN THOUGH IS FOR THAT DRIVER THANK ALL CALLED RIGHT OR WHATEVER. THAT MAKES THE PROBLEM THAT YOU KNOW FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE SO THAT YES YOU MAKE IT WHERE A- TEN DOLLAR FINE IF YOU DO IT AGAIN. IT DOUBLES OR WHATEVER SO WITH THE- PERSON IN THERE YOU GET THE MEDINA FIGHT YOU KNOW YOU TELL THEM AND GIVE THEM THE- SHE WAS A COMPANY. THAT OPTION OF HATE. YOU HAD FOR PROBLEMS WHATEVER STE JUST A SUGGESTION BEST PRACTICES YOU NEED TO FIND BUT A DINNER FINE WE'RE AND YOU ARE PUTTING THESE PLACES ACT. I WILL OFFER THE ARENA UP THROUGH THERE. UBER AND LIFT FIND EVERYWHERE BECAUSE THERE'S NO DESIGNATED SPOT TO FOR THEM TO UNLOAD INPUT SO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS ALL OVER THE PLACE. I SEE HOW DIRTY IN THE OTHER THINGS I AGREE WITH WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT THEY NEED TO BE MAYBE MONTHLY CHECKED TO BE SURE THAT WHAT SHOULD BEING PUT OUT IS CONFIRMED WHAT'S GOING ON. AGAIN FIND OUT WHAT'S BEST PRACTICES WHAT WILL WORK I GET A LEAVE FOR PARA TRANSIT MEETING SO I'LL LEAVE YOU GUYS AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT THIS AND SEE WHAT YOU COME UP WITH LATER THANK YOU SO MUCH AND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING PART AND- GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY THANKS FOR HANGING WITH THIS FOR SO LONG. HEY GOOD EVENING THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FOR STORAGE THREE. GOOD AFTER AN AD CHAIRMAN FRAZIER CHAIRMAN MCGUIRE MEMBERS. AND YOU MEDI HERE ON BEHALF OF LIME OUT WE WILL BE SUBMITTING SOME FORMAL COMMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE BUT- I WANTED TO JUST TOUCH ON SOME- KIND OF MAIN HIGHLIGHTS THAT. THE COMPANY WANTED TO SHARE TODAY ALSO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR FACILITY FACILITATING THIS CONVERSATION- FOR LYME WE FACILITATED MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION RIDES AROUND THE GLOBE IN ONLY TWO YEARS- BUT WE BELIEVE THAT. SERVING CITIES RIGHT TO REGULATE SCOOTERS IS CRITICAL AND WE RECOMMEND THAT. THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND AGENCIES CAN HELP IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. I'M STATE THE STATE AND CITIES SHOULD ENGAGE WITH OPERATORS TO SET BEST PRACTICES FOR LOCAL POLICY FRAMEWORKS- AND THE STATE SHOULD HEAVILY INVEST AND EXPEDITE FUNDS TO CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT HELP THEM BUILD OUT TRANSIT. AND PROTECTED BIKE IN FOR A BIKE LANE INFRASTRUCTURE- ADDITIONALLY LINES WORK WITH FIFTEEN ON CITIES AROUND THE STATE TO SHARE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL POLICY FRAMEWORKS- THE FIRST. START WITH A REASONABLE NUMBER OF SCOOTERS AND GROW BASED ON DEMAND AND PERFORMANCE THAT MEANS IT'S A PERFORMANCE BASED CAP- WE THINK THAT. THIS HELPS INCENTIVIZE OPERATORS AND- WITH THE FLEET TO INCREASE YOU KNOW SAFETY WORKSHOPS AND SO FORTH. I'M ALSO SUBJECT SCOOTERS TO THE SAME- RULES AS BIKES. SCOOTERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO RIDE ANYWHERE AND ANYTIME THAT A BIKE AND RIDE AND SUBJECTING SCOOTERS TO STRICTER RULES CAN CAUSE CONFUSION AMONG WRITERS. NON WRITERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND ALSO MAKE SURE SCOOTERS ARE RELIABLE CITIES RIGHTFULLY WORRY ABOUT SCOOTER PARKING CLATTER. LIME EDUCATES OUR WRITERS ON PROPER PARKING ADVOCATE BUT SOME CITIES ARE MOVING TO MANDATE PARKING IN DESIGNATED CORRALS. WINDS WRITER ANALYSIS DATA SHOWS HOWEVER THAT. WITH EACH STEP ADDED WITH EACH ADDED STEP THAT A USER HAS TO WALK TO FIND A SCOOTER. THE LESS LIKELY WRITERS WILL CHOOSE THIS SCOOTER AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO A CAR. SO THE BEST APPROACH IS TO HAVE SCOOTERS PART NO MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY FEET FROM ANY BUILDING. AVAILABLE THROUGH EITHER FREE FLOATING PARKING IT. IN LESS DENSE AREA OR A BUNCH PARKING SPACES IN DENSE DOWNTOWNS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONTINUE PROVIDING CALIFORNIANS WITH COST EFFECTIVE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS THANK YOUNG ENGLISHMAN ANYTHING FOR HANGING WITH US GOOD AFTERNOON SIR THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANKS FOR AND WITH THIS THING TO OUR TIME THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOUR THREE MINUTES. OF MY NAME IS DAVE CAMPBELL FEC DIRECTOR WITH BIKE EAST BAY WERE WALK BIKE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA. COUNTIES AND I AM HERE AND SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF MORE MOBILITY DEVICES ON OUR STREETS- IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING I HAVE THIRTY TWO CITIES IN MY TO COUNTY TO BAN SCOOTERS. I HAVE ONE CITY THAT'S BEEN VERY PRO SCOOTERS AND YET WHEN YOU GET TO THAT CITY LINE YOU GOT A PROBLEM- SO ALAMEDA BANDS IN OAKLAND IT'S PRO. BERKELEY'S READY TO DO PERMITS BUT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT LIABILITY EVERY THOSE THINKING ABOUT AT RICHMOND IS READY TO GO BUT THEY'RE WORRIED TOO. THIS IS RIDICULOUS WE DO NEED THE STATE TO STEP IN AND PROVIDE SOME CITIES BAD THESE THINGS. SAID OF FLOOR SET A CEILING AND LET'S WHAT THESE COMPANIES INNOVATE WORKING WITH THE CITY'S ON ALL THESE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT HERE- PLEASE PUSH TOWARDS MORE INNOVATION IN OAKLAND WHERE WE DO HAVE OW. FOR SCOOTER OPERATORS I SEE INNOVATION EVERY DAY ONE OPERATORS OUT IN A MEETING THE OTHER THAT'S. WHAT WE NEED WE NEED IT STATEWIDE AND WE NEED ANY CITY. ONE WAY YOU CAN REALLY HELP US HERE'S BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SAFETY ISSUES YOU HAD AN EXPERT HERE SAYING I'M GIVING YOU A VERY LIMITED SET OF DATA FROM THREE CITIES. ON THIS VERY ISSUE THAT YOU. ASKED ME TO TALK ABOUT THAT'S BAD DATA WHY DON'T WE HAVE BETTER DATA SO I THINK THE STATE CAN STEP IN FUND THIS RESEARCH. MAKE IT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY GETS APPEARANCE AS HERE'S THE SAFETY CONCERN I HAVE WE HAVE REAL DATA THAT BACK TO THE- ON LIABILITY IN INSURANCE I THINK THE STATE DOES HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY. I THINK THE STATE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY ON MAXIMUM. LIABILITY ISSUES OAKLAND HAS A PROVISION WHERE THEY REQUIRE THE MOBILITY OPERATORS TO INDEMNIFY THE CITY OF OAKLAND FOR THE CITY'S OWN DESIGN AND TO ME THAT'S WHAT IF THAT'S OFFENSIVE AS A BIKE ADVOCATE THAT. ANY CITY CAN GET AWAY WITH THAT. THE STATE SHOULD NOT ALLOW CITIES TO DO THAT- FINALLY. WHAT MORE CONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE CITIES WE NEED THAT WE ALSO NEED MORE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE MODES I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK AT. MIKE WILL BUILT E. AS HOLDING IT TO A HIGHER STANDARD. AND SO AS YOU DID. AS YOU DISCUSS HOW TO REGULATE MIKE MOBILITY. ASK HOW'RE WE'D REGULATING SIMILAR OTHER MODES OF TRANSPORTATION DO WE REGULATE CARS THIS WAY DO WE REGULATE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THIS WAY. DO WE REGULATE RAILROADS AND AIRLINES THIS WAY. SO LET'S HOLD ALL OF THESE MOBILITY OPTIONS TO THE SAME STANDARD IF WE CAN THANKS I THANK YOU SO MUCH TO RETURN THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US THIS ENTIRE TIME IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THANK YOU. A GOOD EVENING MA'AM GOOD EVENING- BLANCA CASTRO ON ADVOCACY MANAGER WITH A RP CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT ABOUT THREE POINT THREE MILLION MEMBERS AND I'M HERE TO. JUST REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT- OLDER ADULTS ARE NOT A HOMOGENEOUS POPULATION- THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF MOBILITY IS THAT PEOPLE OF ON. FIFTEEN OVER ARE LOOKING FOR. THE SCOOTERS IS ONE OF THEM E. BIKES IS ONE OF THEM YES BUT WALKING IS ANOTHER. AND SO THESE ARE. A FEW OF OUR CONCERNS FIRST OF ALL. WE DO SUPPORT SHARE DATA WITH LOCALITIES. AND THE SHARED MOBILITY- COMPANIES RECOGNIZING THAT THERE HAS TO BE PERSONAL PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT IS PROTECTED. BY THE SAME TOKEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THEN THE OPTION OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION NEED TO COME INTO PLAY AND WITHOUT THE DATA. AND THIS IS WHERE WE THINK THE STATE CAN COMMAND. IS SETTING THAT STANDARD EVEN IF ITS MINIMUM STANDARD. AND WHAT WE REALLY WERE FRUSTRATED WITH THIS JUSTICE HERE WITH THE CONFUSION OF THE BILL AND THE LANGUAGE SO REALLY JUST MAKING IT VERY SIMPLE BUT THEY JUST NEED THE DATA TO BE ABLE TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE. AND FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND ABILITIES AND THEN WE WOULD LIKE TO ALSO JUST POINT OUT. THAT OLDER ADULTS REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LIVE YOU WANT TO AGE IN YOUR COMMUNITY BUT YOU WANT TO HAVE OPTIONS SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT. THE SAFETY OF THESE MOBILITY OPTIONS ARM AND ALSO THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THEM ARE IN LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS THE HIGH INCOME COMMUNITIES AND LASTLY IWOULD LIKE TO SAY WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- AND WITH MANY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO WERE AROUND DURING THE ELEVEN TWELVE CONVERSATION BUT MAKING IT MUCH MORE VISIBLE THAT WHAT'S THE BENEFIT TO THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THESECOMMUNITIES. SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS WAS EXTREMELY USEFUL AND INFORMATIVE CONVERSATION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE FEBRUARY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DATA SHARING. THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S GOT TO REVIEW YOUR HERE AND I APOLOGIZE I'M A DISTRACTION DISTANTLY T. ON ME. GIVEN THEIR LASSIE AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HELPS YOU YEAH EXACTLY GOOD STUFF I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. MY GOODNESS ALL RIGHT- WELCOME MA'AM GOOD EVENING YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES TO FOR SHORT HI LINDA COMMISSION WITH A CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION. I THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION I THINK WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH ACROSS THE STATE AND ECHOING MY COLLEAGUES AT A BIKE YOU SPAY AS WELL THEY ARE P. THE NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT. BOTH TIMES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT COME ABOUT I WITH THIS I COULDN'T PUT NEW MOBILITY IN AND LIKE TO ECHO WHAT WAS SAID BY MISTER ADEL AND THAT. THIS ISN'T NEW WE HAVE HAD- MICHAEL MOBILITY BIKING WALKING. GETTING TO TRANSIT- AND. NOW WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE HAVE. THE ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE AT A VERY LOW COST MILLIONS OF SCOOTERS AND THESE EVE BIKES NOW. AND ALSO A NUMBER OF A YOU KNOW A LOT OF FUNDING BEHIND IT AS WELL A VENTURE VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING THAT'S A LOT FOR THE DEPLOYMENT. OF THESE SHARED SYSTEMS AND SO WHAT WE SAW IN THE PAST FEW YEARS IS WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED SORT OF A DISRUPTION I INTO OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND WHAT'S THAT'S REALLY BEEN IT'S LIKE IT'S A VOLUME ISSUE THAT. HAPPENED AND IT WOULD HIGHLIGHTED WAS ALSO THE CHALLENGES IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE DID DISCUSS THAT A LOT HERE THERE WAS COMMENTARY ON. WHAT SAFETY REALLY LOOKS LIKE IT'S SUDDENLY PEOPLE FINALLY UNDERSTOOD BETTER SIDEWALKS WERE NOT UP TO PAR OR THAT THERE AREN'T SPACE THERE ISN'T SPACE IN OUR STREETS FOR- ALL THESE- DIFFERENT MODES AND SO. THAT'S SOMETHING TO REALLY COME INTO THIS CONVERSATION TOGETHER AS WELL IN ADDITION TO ANY KIND OF REGULATION AS TO HOW WE- REALLY GOING TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY IT'S IT ISN'T IN THE TERMS OF THE DEVICES AS FROM A CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE WHAT YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT WHERE. CAN PEOPLE BE IN THE STREETS- AND HOW WE MAKE SPACE FOR EVERYONE- YOU KNOW THIS CONVERSATION IS CALLED STAY IN YOUR LANE BUT- THERE AREN'T REALLY MANY LANES FOR PEOPLE THE VAN AND SO- IT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT ASPECT AND THE OTHER IS THAT WE'VE YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD. OF SOME CITIES ARE BANNING THESE ENTIRELY OR NOT ALLOWING FOR THE INNOVATION TO COME INTO THEIR CITIES OTHERS HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME ACTUALLY ATTRACTING THE INDUSTRY TO COME TO. THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE- THEY MIGHT BE LOWER DENSITY OR AT LOWER INCOME AND THAT'S NOT. SOMETHING NECESSARILY THAT'S GOING TO BE PROFITABLE SO THEY ARE WHILE YOU KNOW WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY HAVE TO LOOK AT OPTIONS FOR MAKING IT MORE ACCESSIBLE. TO EVERYONE AND ACROSS- AND THEN ALSO THE SUSTAINABILITY ASPECT YOU KNOW WE- THIS IS IT HOW CAN WE MAKE THIS A SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTION- INSTEAD OF JUST SOMETHING THAT WILL BE PROFITABLE SO. THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS AND I'D ALSO OFFERED THAT I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T HEAR ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS WORK THE ACTUAL USERS THEMSELVES AND. AND HOW THIS COULD BE WE CAN BRING FORTH THE OUR ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS OTHERS WHO ARE WORKING AS STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS PROCESS. NO THANK YOU SO MUCH I KNOW I SPEAK FOR. THE TWO OTHER CHAIR. CHAIRMAN OF AND DIES HERE THAT WE LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH YOU HERE. IN THE MONTHS TO COME SO THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR HANGING WITH US AS WELL. ALL RIGHT PLACE GENERALLY TO BE TO TURN IT OVER TO CHAIRMAN FRAZIER THAN DETERMINE VAL HUMAN FRAZIER- IT HAS BEEN. AN AMAZING PARTNER THROUGHOUT THIS. TO TWENTY SIX THANK YOU SIR- INTO TEAM AS WELL. FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS. IF YOU'RE WILLING TO BE A PARTNER AND I THINK IT'S ALWAYS GOOD RIGHT WE CAN TRY TO WORK WITH ONE VOICE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND- IT'S. IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH YOU SIR ALL FROM THE FLOOR. THANK CHAIRMAN. SO ESSENTIALLY YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE COME OUT OF. THIS THIS HEARING IS AND HEARING FROM THESE. WONDERFUL PANELISTS IS THAT- WE HAVE AN ISSUE THAT WE WANT TO GET A HANDLE ON EARLIER THAN WE DO LATER AND. WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IS THE STAKEHOLDERS COME TOGETHER- PRIOR TO THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION. AND ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD. AND REMOVE AN ADVERSARIAL HELLO KIND OF. BACK AND FORTH GOING FORWARD WE'VE HEARD THE ISSUES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE'S SAFETY IS OF UTMOST CONCERN- BUT ALSO- COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT I ALSO WANT LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO HAVE A VOICE I WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN THAT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT WILL NOT WORK IN THEIR COMMUNITY. HI AND I DON'T LIKE A HEAVY HANDED APPROACH GOING FORWARD A BY THE SEE I CAN SEE OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF A BASELINE TO GO FORWARD- BUT I I'M LOOKING FOR INPUT FROM THE CITIES ON HOW. THEY CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE WITH A. THERE NEEDS BEING ADDRESSED BY THEMSELVES- I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THE WE GIVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY. FOR ANY ENTITY IN CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. A BUSINESS SUCCESSFUL AND I WANT THE. ANY CONSTRAINTS BE BROUGHT FORWARD TO MISTER BELLER MYSELF OR MR ROOM ON MCGUIRE THAT. DID THERE IS SOME KIND OF HEAVY HANDED A REGULATORY APPROACH IT WOULD AFFECT THEM IN PRECLUDE THEM FROM BEING A PART OF AN EQUATION. OF SUCCESS. SO I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR HIS CONSIDERATION AND INCLUDING THE ALSO- BUT ALSO THESE WONDERFUL PANELISTS WHO BROUGHT THIS INFORMATION ENLIGHTEN ME- IMMENSELY TODAY ON THIS EMERGING TECHNOLOGY AND HERO NOW I MIGHT NOT. HAVE BEEN INCLINED TO USE IT. BECAUSE OF LIKE MISTER WELCOME PROBABLY EXCEED THE CAPACITY OF THE SCOOTER. BUT I WANT PEOPLE THAT OR- LESS HEAVY BE ABLE TO UTILIZE ANYTHING THEY CAN FROM ABILITY AND- BUT ONE THING I WILL STATE IS THAT I DO NOT HEY WE WILL NOT ALLOW THE PEOPLE DISABILITIES COULD BE- IGNORED I THINK THAT IS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES WE HAVE TO BRING THE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WITH US AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE ADDRESSED AND AGAIN HER ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN IGNORED THE PAST NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND BROUGHT FORTH BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE GOES FORWARD. WITH THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AS CHAIRMAN THE FOR TO WORK WITH YOU IR THANK TURN OVER TO CHAIRMAN BALLOT WILL TURN OVER THE VICE CHAIR FOR CLOSING COMMENTS CHAIRMAN BILL THE STORM I'M GOING TO ENJOY THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WORKING ON THIS- AND HAVE THE HEARING- WE'RE TRYING TO SCHEDULE OF FEBRUARY. YEAH FROM THERE SOMETIME BUT. I LOOK LIKE I SAID EARLIER I WAS. ATTENDING AM NATIONAL CONFERENCE IN NON TRANSIT AND- GOT A LITTLE TASTE GOT MATERIALS ON. THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO COME IN THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF TRANSPORTATION IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE- A VERY- DYNAMIC. KIND OF ENVIRONMENT REAL SOON IN THE FUTURE AND OUR COUNTRY I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TRANSIT VILLAGE AYE I- I'M EXCITED ABOUT OR- OR- HIGHSPEED RAIL STATION. MULTI MODAL STATION SAN JOSE WHICH WILL BE THE- LARGEST- TRANSIT STATION TURNS A RIDERSHIP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WILL HAVE- TRANSIT VILLAGES THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING AROUND- THE BART STATIONS THAT WERE BUILDING WE- WERE BUILDING- FOUR MILLION BILLION FIVE BILLION DOLLAR. BART EXTENSION. AND IN SAN JOSE SO AND GIVE IT AND A LOT OF OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE DOING THE SAME THING THAT THE HIGH DENSITY VILLAGES THAT ARE TALKED ABOUT IN LOS ANGELES AROUND- THE TRANSIT STOPS IN LOS ANGELES IS A SIMILAR KIND OF THING. SO I THINK I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF THIS. THIS KIND OF. DIFFERENT KIND OF TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS THAT. ARE GOING TO BE USE MORE AND MORE AND BECOME MORE PREVALENT- AND I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT HOW WE CAN ENCOURAGE- AND UC'S. MOBILITY DEVICES TO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF TRANSIT AND CLEANER AND GET PEOPLE TO STOP USING AUTOMOBILES. LOOK AT OTHER OTHER METHODS OF- CREATING A BETTER ENVIRONMENT IN A BETTER LIFESTYLE IF YOU WANT TO SET THAT WE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE SO. SO I WILL WORK HARD HARD ON THAT AND- SEE IT AS A PIECE TO THE PUZZLE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR. FIND WORK AND SPECIALLY BEING HERE AFTER ALL THE HARDSHIPS SUFFERED MISTER GERMAN THINK OF OVER THE LAST- STE FEW WEEKS AND. IT'S NICE OF YOU TO BE HERE TO SEE YOU KNOW I THINK IT IS I WAS KIND OF WORRIED THAT WHETHER OR NOT YOU BE HER OR NOT I KNOW YOU SHOWED UP YOU NEED TO ENTER THE WHOLE HEARING NOTHING THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SAID ABOUT ONCE TAKE ONCE HE THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT ALL THROUGHOUT- IN YOU KNOW THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME AND THINK THE WORLD IS SIR SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.THE GENTLEMAN WOULD LIKE TO TURN OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIRS SERVE FOR CLOSING COMMENTS AND HAVE SOME QUICK CLOSING. COMMENTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ONE OF THE THINGS SAID. WHAT WAS BEEN FRUSTRATING ME. IS THAT- SACRAMENTO TENDS TO BE MORE REACTIVE THAN PROACTIVE. AND SO WE'RE NOW REACTING TO THE- SITUATION OF THE FIRES STARTED BY UTILITY. LINES PERHAPS IN IN SO SOME SOME USERS WE'VE GOT TO GET IN FRONT OF AND SO. I FIND THIS TOPIC VERY FACETING WITH A. THE ABILITY OF THE SHARED ECONOMY AND NEW MOBILITY OPTIONS IN THERE'S A LOT MORE COMMON. DOWN THE LINE IN IN AND WE'VE GOT TO START GETTING PROACTIVE- WE HAVE SELF DRIVING VEHICLES. WE HAVE A YOU KNOW AND I INCREDIBLE WAY OF PERSONAL RAPID TRANSIT I DON'T SEE HIGH SPEED RAIL PERHAPS. IN THE SAME WAY YOU DO CENTER BELL BUT- WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO START THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH OUR VEHICLES AND HOW ARE MOVING INDIVIDUALS AND HOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL PLAY INTO THAT. IN THE YEARS TO COME. IT'S WHY I THOUGHT THE TITLE WAS WAS SORT OF INTERESTING YOU KNOW HOW DO WE REGULATE NEW MOBILITY AND I AND I JUST WONDER SOMETIMES MISTER CHAIR IF WE SHOULD SAY HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE. AS OPPOSED TO HOW WE REGULATE HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE THE FREE MARKET. AND PROVIDED TEMPLATE FOR SUCCESS BECAUSE THIS IS CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS WHERE ALL THESE GREAT IDEAS ARE COMING FROM. IN A AND HOW DO WE- GIVE THE RIGHT- BORDERS AND PARAMETERS FOR. SOME CREATIVITY AND INGENUITY- MOVING FORWARD AND HOW DO WE AS A GOVERNMENT REALLY GET IN FRONT OF THAT TO PROVIDE THE PLATFORM. SO THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE GOING FORWARD SO THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME. SHARE SOME OF THE STOCK THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU TOO BYE CHAIRED BY SHARES ALWAYS SO GOOD IN IS ALL OVER. ALL COMMITTEE HEARINGS WERE VERY GRATEFUL SIR LOVE WORKING WITH YOU. SO BOTTOM LINE IS THIS AND I'M JUST GONNA STOP YOU HAPPEN IN TURN. OVER ALL YEAR IN IN MORE DURING HERE. EVERYONE WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT BOTH BILLS OR TAKE MOM TO SAY THANK YOU TO BOTH OFF AUTHORS TO RESEARCHING THIS FRIEDMAN. UP FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THIS THIS YEAR- BOTH HAD BILL'S GOING ONE FOCUSING LOCAL REGULATION THE OTHER AND DATA SHARING. BOTH WANTED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THEIR BILLS AND THEY'RE WILLING TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEES. IN THE SENATE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE AN OVER ARCHING APPROACH THE REASON WHY WE WANTED TO TAKE A THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT APPROACHES IT'S BEEN VERY HONEST ABOUT IT. WE TAKE A LOOK AT ISSUES OF LIKE THE SHARING ECONOMY IT COULD BE TEEN SEES OR COULD BE- ROOM SHERRY. OUR HOME SHARING- WE ALLOW THIS TO GET GOING. AND THEN WE SAW CHALLENGES AND WE TRY TO BRING IT BACK. WHAT WE WANTED TO BE REDUCES TO THIS RIGHT. PRIOR TO A INDUSTRY THAT'S GOING TO BE LARGE TAKEN OFF. HOW CAN WE COME TOGETHER AS ONE TO TRY TO PUT. SOME PARAMETERS TO THIS. AND THAT'S WHY WE ENDED UP HERE TODAY I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A COMPROMISE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IT'S GONNA MEAN COMPROMISE BETWEEN. CORPORATIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS EVERYONE GOING TO GET WHAT THEY WANT. PROBABLY NOT BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT A STRONG COMPROMISE IS ALL ABOUT- SO HERE ARE NEXT STEPS. WE LOOK AT A JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING. COMING UP IN FEBRUARY JUDICIARY WILL ALSO BE INVOLVED ESPECIALLY IN THE DATA SHARING SIDE. AND THAT'S WITH CHAIRMAN JACKSON WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET INTO HER LANE ON THAT. SHOULD BE TAKEN LEAD ON ALL ISSUES OF DATA SHARING- BOTH BILLS WILL END UP COMING TO GOVERNMENT FINANCE HERE IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND OUR COMMITMENT WHETHER IT IS TO- TO LINE ORDER BIRD OR THE CONSUMER TOURNEY'S OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE GOING TO WORKING TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY. WITH ALL SIDES TRY TO MAKE THIS WORK. FROM HERE FROM TO DAY- AND TRYING TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS- HERE TO BE A START. A MASSAGE IN THESE BILLS TO MAKE IT WORK FOR EACH AND EVERYONE. THEN OBVIOUSLY WE'LL HAVE THAT DATA SHARING PRIVACY HEARING. COMING UP IN FEBRUARY WHICH WILL BE JOINT. WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO OUR PANELISTS WHO DID A FABULOUS JOB TODAY THANK YOU. WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR SHOWN UP- AND FOR DOING YOUR JOB SO WELL. I WANT TO THANK YOU TO THE STAFF TEAMS. UP FROM BOTH ASSEMBLY TRANS IS WELLS GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE.
