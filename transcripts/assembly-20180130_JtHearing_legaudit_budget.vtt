00:39:22.594 --> 00:39:25.463 region:rollup2
COMPRISED R. CONSISTED OF FOUR

00:39:24.062 --> 00:39:27.465 region:rollup2
ACTIONS.

00:39:25.463 --> 00:39:29.767 region:rollup2
ONE.

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:31.236 region:rollup2
INFORMING CAMPUSES THAT

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:33.471 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR'S WERE TO REVIEW THE

00:39:31.236 --> 00:39:35.039 region:rollup2
SURVEY RESPONSES.

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:37.275 region:rollup2
TOGETHER WITH INFORMING CAMPUSES

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:39.544 region:rollup2
SECOND.

00:39:37.275 --> 00:39:41.246 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CO P.. WOULD ALSO OF

00:39:39.544 --> 00:39:43.047 region:rollup2
REVIEW.

00:39:41.246 --> 00:39:45.183 region:rollup2
THIRD.

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:48.386 region:rollup2
WE ALSO FOUND THAT INFORMING

00:39:45.183 --> 00:39:50.688 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES THAT SURVEY RESPONSES.

00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:53.591 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT A TIME TO QUOTE AIR

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:55.960 region:rollup2
DIRTY LAUNDRY.

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:58.196 region:rollup2
AND FOURTH TYPE OF INTERFERENCE

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.965 region:rollup2
WAS SUGGESTING REVISIONS.

00:39:58.196 --> 00:40:04.802 region:rollup2
AND CHANGES TO RESPONSES.

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:06.938 region:rollup2
THAT REFLECTED POORLY FUND. A UC

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:08.740 region:rollup2
OPIATE ALMOST.

00:40:06.938 --> 00:40:10.341 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY LARGELY IF NOT.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:12.443 region:rollup2
EXCLUSIVELY THE REVISIONS.

00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:14.746 region:rollup2
TENDED TO PUT.

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:16.180 region:rollup2
THE UC OPIUM A MORE FAVORABLE AS

00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:18.549 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO UNFAVORABLE. FILED

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:20.752 region:rollup2
LYFT.

00:40:18.549 --> 00:40:23.187 region:rollup2
WE ALSO FOUND THAT PRESIDENT

00:40:20.752 --> 00:40:24.555 region:rollup2
APOLLO TUNNEL APPROVED A PLAN.

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:26.324 region:rollup2
THAT INVOLVED THE FIRST TWO ACTS

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:28.159 region:rollup2
THAT I HAVE DESCRIBED.

00:40:26.324 --> 00:40:30.128 region:rollup2
THAT IS ONE.

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:31.296 region:rollup2
INFORMING CAMPUSES THAT

00:40:30.128 --> 00:40:33.197 region:rollup2
CHANCELLORS WERE TO REVIEW THE

00:40:31.296 --> 00:40:35.133 region:rollup2
RESPONSE WAS.

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:37.535 region:rollup2
IT'S PART OF THE. CAMPUS MEAL.

00:40:35.133 --> 00:40:40.071 region:rollup2
AND SECOND.

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:41.739 region:rollup2
THE CAMPUSES PERFORMED AT UC OP

00:40:40.071 --> 00:40:44.142 region:rollup2
WOULD UP REVIEW.

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:45.443 region:rollup2
THOSE RESPONSES.

00:40:44.142 --> 00:40:47.578 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE EVIDENCE

00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:50.348 region:rollup2
WE FOUND.

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:53.184 region:rollup2
IS INSUFFICIENT BUT TO CONCLUDE.

00:40:50.348 --> 00:40:55.153 region:rollup2
THAT SHE KNEW OF OR APPROVED.

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:57.021 region:rollup2
THE LATTER TWO ACTIONS.

00:40:55.153 --> 00:40:58.756 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

00:40:57.021 --> 00:41:00.591 region:rollup2
INFORMING CAMPUSES THAT THEIR

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:02.193 region:rollup2
SURVEY RESPONSES WERE NOT THE

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:03.995 region:rollup2
TIME TO AIR DIRTY LAUNDRY.

00:41:02.193 --> 00:41:05.997 region:rollup2
AND SECOND.

00:41:03.995 --> 00:41:07.565 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING REVISIONS AND CHANGES

00:41:05.997 --> 00:41:11.402 region:rollup2
TO RESPONSES THAT REFLECTED

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:12.670 region:rollup2
POORLY. ON UC LP.

00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:13.671 region:rollup2
NOW THESE FIRST TWO ACTIONS THAT

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:15.673 region:rollup2
I'VE DESCRIBED INVOLVED

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:18.242 region:rollup2
INTERFERENCE.

00:41:15.673 --> 00:41:21.646 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN A VERY LARGE SENSE.

00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:23.748 region:rollup2
THE CHILLED A CAMPUS RESPONSES.

00:41:21.646 --> 00:41:25.516 region:rollup2
INDEED ONE TRAPS WERE ADMITTED

00:41:23.748 --> 00:41:27.485 region:rollup2
TO REVISING.

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:29.721 region:rollup2
HIS ANSWERS AS A RESULT.

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:30.788 region:rollup2
OF THESE TWO ACTIONS.

00:41:29.721 --> 00:41:31.856 region:rollup2
WHAT I MEAN TO SAY BY THAT IS

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:34.359 region:rollup2
THAT?

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:34.826 region:rollup2
SIMPLY KNOWING.

00:41:34.359 --> 00:41:36.728 region:rollup2
FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S

00:41:34.826 --> 00:41:38.963 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE.

00:41:36.728 --> 00:41:40.965 region:rollup2
SUBORDINATES OF THAT CHANCELLOR.

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:42.200 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SEE OP WOULD REVIEW

00:41:40.965 --> 00:41:44.001 region:rollup2
SURVEY RESPONSES.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.771 region:rollup2
IN EFFECT

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:47.038 region:rollup2
PLACED A CHILLING EFFECT ON.

00:41:46.771 --> 00:41:50.541 region:rollup2
OF THOSE.

00:41:47.038 --> 00:41:52.643 region:rollup2
RESPONSES.

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:55.246 region:rollup2
THE PRESIDENT DAN CHIEF OF STAFF

AND THEN DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF.

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:57.982 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN THE LETTER TO

00:41:55.747 --> 00:41:59.183 region:rollup2
ACTIONS.

00:41:57.982 --> 00:42:00.151 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE AIRING OF DIRTY

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:02.120 region:rollup2
LAUNDRY AND ALSO MAKING THE

00:42:00.151 --> 00:42:06.557 region:rollup2
REVISIONS.

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:08.426 region:rollup2
A TWO THE. SURVEY RESPONSES.

00:42:06.557 --> 00:42:09.861 region:rollup2
THEY INFORMED CAMPUSES THAT THE

00:42:08.426 --> 00:42:11.496 region:rollup2
SURVEYS WERE NOT THE TIME TO

00:42:09.861 --> 00:42:13.531 region:rollup2
REVEAL.

00:42:11.496 --> 00:42:14.932 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE INFORMATION.

00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:18.536 region:rollup2
AND THE PATIENT SUBMIT THEIR

00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:20.772 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO YOU FEEL PRETTY.

00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:26.978 region:rollup2
THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF THEN

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:28.346 region:rollup2
PROVIDED COMMENTS.

RESPONSES.

00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:35.553 region:rollup2
NOW THESE ACTIONS OBVIOUSLY

00:42:32.183 --> 00:42:36.821 region:rollup2
INTERFERED WITH THE RESPONSES.

00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:38.356 region:rollup2
THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THESE

00:42:36.821 --> 00:42:39.724 region:rollup2
ACTIONS WERE UNDERTAEN BY THE

00:42:38.356 --> 00:42:41.192 region:rollup2

THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT.

00:43:13.558 --> 00:43:16.360 region:rollup2
THAT RESPONSES WOULD BE

00:43:15.093 --> 00:43:18.830 region:rollup2
FACTUALLY ACCURATE.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:21.199 region:rollup2
AND THIRD.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:22.300 region:rollup2
THAT THE SURVEY RESPONSES WOULD

00:43:21.199 --> 00:43:24.502 region:rollup2
REFLECT THE ACTUAL VIEWS.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.471 region:rollup2
OF THE CAMPUS

PROFFERED THAT.

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:36.180 region:rollup2
THE CAMPUS IS THEMSELVES.

00:43:34.212 --> 00:43:38.349 region:rollup2
EXPRESSED CONFUSION REGARDING.

A SURVEY.

00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:41.686 region:rollup2
AND IN THAT SENSE WELCOMED ANY

AND THIRD.

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:49.660 region:rollup2
THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT HAS

00:43:47.892 --> 00:43:52.697 region:rollup2
INDICATED THAT THEY RELY ON THE

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:55.466 region:rollup2

REGARDING.

00:43:55.933 --> 00:44:00.304 region:rollup2
THE FIRST A POINT.

00:43:58.703 --> 00:44:02.173 region:rollup2
THAT IS TO ENSURE THE SKILL

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:02.907 region:rollup2
BACKERS SEE.

00:44:02.173 --> 00:44:05.076 region:rollup2
AND THE VIEWS OF THE.

THE COMMENTS PROVIDED ON THE

00:44:06.444 --> 00:44:11.182 region:rollup2

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:13.117 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE ANALYZE THOSE.

00:44:11.182 --> 00:44:14.318 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT IN FACT LIMITED.

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:17.121 region:rollup2
SCOPE ACCURACY IN CHANCELLOR

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:21.392 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE SECOND POINT.

00:44:19.857 --> 00:44:22.894 region:rollup2

THE CAMPUSES THEMSELVES FOR

00:44:22.894 --> 00:44:25.530 region:rollup2
EXPRESS SOME DEGREE OF

00:44:23.361 --> 00:44:27.465 region:rollup2
CONFUSION.

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:29.700 region:rollup2
CONSERVING THE SURVEY.

00:44:27.465 --> 00:44:32.470 region:rollup2
ITSELF.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:33.538 region:rollup2
WE FIND THE ASSERTION THAT THE.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:34.705 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES WE'RE CONFUSED

00:44:33.538 --> 00:44:36.974 region:rollup2

THERE WAS SOME.

00:44:44.649 --> 00:44:48.352 region:rollup2
DEGREE A CONFUSION ABOUT WHO

00:44:46.817 --> 00:44:50.521 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THE DESIGNATED.

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:50.988 region:rollup2
OF RESPONDER.

00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:52.490 region:rollup2
AND I BELIEVE ON THE.

00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:54.692 region:rollup2

00:44:57.395 --> 00:45:00.298 region:rollup2
THEREWERE APPROXIMATELY SIXTY

00:44:59.397 --> 00:45:01.532 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT HAD TO BE

00:45:00.298 --> 00:45:02.633 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED OUT TO DIFFERENT

PEOPLE ON CAMPUS SO TO THAT

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:05.169 region:rollup2
DEGREE.

00:45:04.035 --> 00:45:06.571 region:rollup2
THE OTHER MAY HAVE BEEN SOME

00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:08.206 region:rollup2
CONFUSION AS TO WHO THE PROPER

00:45:06.571 --> 00:45:11.275 region:rollup2
RESPONDER WAS.

00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:13.277 region:rollup2
FOR CERTAIN DRUG QUESTIONS.

00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:14.779 region:rollup2
AT A MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT

THE SERVICE.

00:45:16.781 --> 00:45:20.351 region:rollup2
BUT THE RECORD DOES NOT REFLECT.

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:22.320 region:rollup2
THAT PASSED WITH THE PRESIDENT'S

00:45:20.351 --> 00:45:23.421 region:rollup2

SIGNIFICA THAT A MITIGATING

00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:44.408 region:rollup2
FACTOR.

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:45.843 region:rollup2
IN RESPONSE TO CAMUS CONCERNS.

STAFF WERE SYSTEMATICALLY

00:57:39.756 --> 00:57:42.559 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTED OR SANITIZING

00:57:41.325 --> 00:57:44.161 region:rollup2
CRITICAL COMMENTS

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:46.530 region:rollup2
FROM THE CAMPUSES. BUT YOUR

00:57:44.161 --> 00:57:48.966 region:rollup2
CONCLUSION IS NOT THAT SHE KNEW.

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:49.833 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING.

00:57:48.966 --> 00:57:52.169 region:rollup2
BUT SO I'M AYE.

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:53.537 region:rollup2
IF YOU CAN JUST HELP US FIND

00:57:52.169 --> 00:57:55.672 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS THE COUNTERBALANCE SEEN

00:57:53.537 --> 00:57:57.474 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE THAT TO THE SANTA CRUZ

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:58.475 region:rollup2
EMAIL.

00:57:57.474 --> 00:57:59.743 region:rollup2
WE MATCH IT'S THE STRONGEST

00:57:58.475 --> 00:58:01.244 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE ROSE YOU IS WELL AWARE

00:57:59.743 --> 00:58:02.779 region:rollup2
OF SYSTEMATIC.

00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:04.281 region:rollup2
SANITIZING WHAT WAS THE COUNTER

00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:04.915 region:rollup2
BALLOT THOUGH THAT THE COUNTER

00:58:04.281 --> 00:58:06.984 region:rollup2
BALANCE AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR

00:58:04.915 --> 00:58:08.418 region:rollup2
QUESTION. CORRECTLY IS THAT THAT

00:58:06.984 --> 00:58:09.886 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE

00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:13.423 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR AND.

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:16.660 region:rollup2
NOW THE PRESIDENT IS SOMEONE.

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:19.129 region:rollup2
INDISPUTABLE TONE AND SOFORTH.

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:22.165 region:rollup2
AND ONE CONCLUSION BASED UPON.

00:58:19.129 --> 00:58:24.034 region:rollup2
THE TONE MAYBE THAT.

00:58:22.165 --> 00:58:26.770 region:rollup2
SHE WAS MORE AWARE OF THE FACT

00:58:24.034 --> 00:58:29.406 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:30.741 region:rollup2
SHE WAS MORE THAN JUST UPSET

00:58:29.406 --> 00:58:33.176 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FACT THAT.

00:58:30.741 --> 00:58:35.879 region:rollup2

THROUGH YOU STILL PAY.

00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:42.452 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT WE

00:58:40.751 --> 00:58:43.186 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT SHE KNEW.

00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:45.389 region:rollup2

OF STAFF FOUND TO BE.

00:58:47.224 --> 00:58:50.160 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATICAL.

00:58:48.992 --> 00:58:52.796 region:rollup2
OF THAT SHE HAD ANY INFORMATION

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:54.431 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE.

00:58:52.796 --> 00:58:55.766 region:rollup2
OF THOSE RESPONSES WE SAY THE

00:58:54.431 --> 00:58:58.135 region:rollup2

RATHER.

00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:06.676 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE DEPUTY CHIEF STAFF.

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:08.211 region:rollup2
AND THE CHANCELLOR THAT WENT

00:59:06.676 --> 00:59:09.679 region:rollup2
BACK AND FORTH AND ULTIMATELY.

00:59:08.211 --> 00:59:11.515 region:rollup2

BY THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF.

00:59:15.685 --> 00:59:18.922 region:rollup2

01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:19.783 region:rollup2
PRELIMINARY QUESTION.

NOT TO SOLICIT THE ADVICE BUT

LATER SHE WAS ADVISED.

01:01:17.474 --> 01:01:19.643 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ADVICE HAD BEEN

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:21.444 region:rollup2

HERE EVERY SPENT SOME TIME

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:57.507 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THAT QUESTION OF HOW

01:02:55.305 --> 01:02:59.142 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED THE SURVEY WASN'T?

01:02:57.507 --> 01:03:00.677 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT BE REASONABLE FOR.

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:03.046 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO WANT TO RUN SOME OF

01:03:00.677 --> 01:03:04.047 region:rollup2
THE. RESPONSES THAT THE CHAIN

01:03:03.046 --> 01:03:05.215 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE ATTORNEY HIDE

01:03:04.047 --> 01:03:06.883 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT BECAUSE THIS IS A

01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:07.817 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT COMPLEX SURVEY WITH A

01:03:06.883 --> 01:03:11.221 region:rollup2

THEIR UNIT OR SECTION.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:20.430 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WOULD BE REASONABLE

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:21.931 region:rollup2
TO DO FOR.

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:23.800 region:rollup2
SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:25.402 region:rollup2

SENSE THAT THEY REFLECT.

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:30.540 region:rollup2
THE COMPLEXITY OF WHAT WAS BEING

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:32.008 region:rollup2
ASKED THESE CAMPUSES IN THE

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:33.977 region:rollup2

WITH GIVING. FACTUAL TRUTHFUL

01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:38.781 region:rollup2

THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ANY

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:43.353 region:rollup2

REASONABLE THAT DOESN'T JUSTIFY.

01:08:50.827 --> 01:08:53.796 region:rollup2
WHAT IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE THE

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:55.498 region:rollup2

01:09:01.838 --> 01:09:04.140 region:rollup2
TO CONTEXTUALIZE A LITTLE BIT OF

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:06.642 region:rollup2

AT LEAST WITH RESPECT TO THE

A BUT I THINK THEY'VE.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:53.523 region:rollup2
THEY'VE TAKEN THAT THE REPORT

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.725 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:56.859 region:rollup2
VIEW IT TOUGH FAVORABLY.

01:09:55.725 --> 01:09:58.461 region:rollup2

ENGAGING IN THEM THIS KIND OF.

01:10:01.631 --> 01:10:04.867 region:rollup2
.

01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:07.303 region:rollup2
SURVEY REVIEW WAS.

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:08.971 region:rollup2
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:10.239 region:rollup2
OTHER HIGH AND THAT THE.

01:10:08.971 --> 01:10:12.275 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN AND

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:14.077 region:rollup2
I FACT I THINK THIS BODY.

01:10:12.275 --> 01:10:16.446 region:rollup2
I AN ACT WITH SOME LEGISLATION

01:10:14.077 --> 01:10:18.681 region:rollup2
REALLY CORRECT. RATTLED PUTTING.

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:20.249 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS ON MAKING IT CLEAR

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:21.751 region:rollup2
IT WASN'T CLEAR BEFORE.

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:22.819 region:rollup2
THAT THE ANY KIND OF

01:10:21.751 --> 01:10:25.021 region:rollup2
INTERFERENCE WITH THE TYPE I

SO IN YOUR ESTIMATION YOU THINK

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:32.328 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE DONE SUFFICIENT

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:35.031 region:rollup2
ACTIONS.

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:36.833 region:rollup2
TO TO GUARANTEE THAT.

01:10:35.031 --> 01:10:38.935 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF TAMPERING WOULDN'T

SHED A LITTLE MORE LIGHT ON HOW

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:41.164 region:rollup2
MANY FOLKS ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:42.632 region:rollup2
WHAT ROLES THEY OCCUPIED IN THE

01:11:41.164 --> 01:11:43.966 region:rollup2

ALL ORIGINATED WITH AN EARLIER.

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:06.022 region:rollup2

WE DIDN'T REALLY GOING TO ALL

01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:16.933 region:rollup2
THAT DETAIL BECAUSE THAT WAS

01:12:14.597 --> 01:12:20.636 region:rollup2
KIND OF COLLATERAL AND ISSUE

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:22.371 region:rollup2
THAT PERHAPS SUB BUT HOME.

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:24.140 region:rollup2
AND THE SCREEN DE DESCRIBES

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:24.941 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP. AS BEING THAT WE

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:27.310 region:rollup2
HEARD THAT.

01:12:24.941 --> 01:12:28.744 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF TIMES

01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:30.413 region:rollup2
LOW. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:32.615 region:rollup2
THAT MOTIVATED.

01:12:30.413 --> 01:12:33.883 region:rollup2
THE COMMENTS AND REVISIONS AND

01:12:32.615 --> 01:12:34.851 region:rollup2

01:12:41.157 --> 01:12:43.025 region:rollup2
ON THE REPORT YOU ARE GO OVER

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:44.427 region:rollup2

KNOW THAT INTENTIONAL EMISSIONS

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:51.200 region:rollup2
OR MISLEADING INFORMATION CAN

01:12:49.665 --> 01:12:53.769 region:rollup2
CAUSE THE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS TO

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.304 region:rollup2
BE INCOMPLETE OR IMPROPER AND

01:12:53.769 --> 01:12:57.073 region:rollup2

UNIVERSITY

01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:00.977 region:rollup2
I SAYING BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT

01:12:59.609 --> 01:13:03.512 region:rollup2
OCCURRED THAT THE STATE AUDITOR

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:04.280 region:rollup2

EVIDENCE WHEN IT COMES FROM

BEING FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK

01:13:24.367 --> 01:13:26.836 region:rollup2
FELL ON THAT UNBIASED

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:28.671 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGEABLE CATEGORY AS

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:30.773 region:rollup2

MONEY MANAGEMENT CATEGORY YOU

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:33.909 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT'S THE EASIEST BECAUSE

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.844 region:rollup2
THE NEGATIVE. COMMENTS ABOUT

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:36.212 region:rollup2
RIGHT THE COMMENTS THAT

01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:38.180 region:rollup2
BASICALLY PURPORT THAT THE

01:13:36.212 --> 01:13:39.749 region:rollup2
AUDITOR I WAS NOT VIOLENT

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:42.385 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING GOVERNOR LISTENING

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:43.653 region:rollup2
THINKS FOR THE MOST PART THEY

01:13:42.385 --> 01:13:44.854 region:rollup2
WERE CONFINED KIND OF THE.

01:13:43.653 --> 01:13:45.621 region:rollup2
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT FLOOR

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:47.957 region:rollup2
THAT EXECUTIVE OFFICE. FLOOR

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:48.491 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK.

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:49.258 region:rollup2
THEY FELT THEY WERE BEING

01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:51.494 region:rollup2
DILUTED WITH.

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:52.995 region:rollup2
AUDITOR'S MILLING ABOUT IN

01:13:51.494 --> 01:13:55.965 region:rollup2
ASKING QUESTIONS AND.

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:57.066 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR HARD DRIVES AND. THIS

01:13:55.965 --> 01:13:58.868 region:rollup2
IS WHAT MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT

01:13:57.066 --> 01:14:01.337 region:rollup2
THEY WERE JUST.

01:13:58.868 --> 01:14:03.272 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT THERE.

01:14:01.337 --> 01:14:06.242 region:rollup2
BEING TOO INVASIVE RIGHT BUT.

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:08.577 region:rollup2
THOSE FEELINGS WERE.

01:14:06.242 --> 01:14:10.413 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW CAN CERTAINLY.

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:11.948 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE FEELINGS CONCERNING THE

01:14:10.413 --> 01:14:15.618 region:rollup2
AUTHOR REALLY REACH BEYOND.

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:17.019 region:rollup2
JUST THE THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE I

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:17.653 region:rollup2
WOULD. REALLY WITH JUST THE

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:19.722 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD.

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:22.058 region:rollup2
I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER.

01:14:19.722 --> 01:14:24.293 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A CALCULATION THAT

01:14:22.058 --> 01:14:25.928 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT.

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:27.830 region:rollup2
THINK THE AUDITOR GAVE THEM.

01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:29.198 region:rollup2
UNDERESTIMATE THIS ISN'T IT

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:31.634 region:rollup2
LIKE THE IRS TELL YOU SEEM TO

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:32.935 region:rollup2
TAKE TWENTY MINUTES.

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:34.303 region:rollup2
HOW LONG DOES IT REALLY TAKE?

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:36.372 region:rollup2
HIM TWENTY DOLLARS SOLOS ON THE

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:38.708 region:rollup2
MAGNITUDE OF MAYBE FOUR TO ONE.

01:14:36.372 --> 01:14:40.843 region:rollup2
OF THAT THE WORK TO RESPOND.

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:42.078 region:rollup2
ACCURATELY.

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:43.846 region:rollup2
TO THESE QUESTIONS WASN'T TAKE

01:14:42.078 --> 01:14:44.980 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE TIME THAN.

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:46.215 region:rollup2
THAT WAS APPARENT AND I THINK

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:48.617 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE JUST.

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:51.220 region:rollup2
OF THE CONCERN.

01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:52.421 region:rollup2
UP AT THE LOWER LEVEL.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.423 region:rollup2
UP PEOPLE AFTER PROVIDING THE

01:20:18.781 --> 01:20:21.617 region:rollup2
NO ONE SHOULD BE CORDON

01:20:19.615 --> 01:20:23.419 region:rollup2
THREATENED IT CERTAINLY. BUT

01:20:21.617 --> 01:20:24.920 region:rollup2
THEN ITS FOLLOW UP AUDIT STAFF

01:20:23.419 --> 01:20:25.921 region:rollup2
ROAMING THE HALLS.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:27.423 region:rollup2
BUT THEN AGAIN THE SALUTE TO THE

01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:29.692 region:rollup2
PHRASE CORNERING PEOPLE.

01:20:27.423 --> 01:20:31.260 region:rollup2

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:33.028 region:rollup2
DISPARITIES ACTUALLY SAWWHAT

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:34.029 region:rollup2
WAS LOOKING FOR A LITTLE MORE

01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:35.964 region:rollup2

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:42.771 region:rollup2
PROCEDURE FOR.

01:20:36.965 --> 01:20:43.338 region:rollup2
FOR THE INFORMATION THEY HAVE A

01:20:42.771 --> 01:20:48.177 region:rollup2
LEGAL RIGHT TO UNDER THE LAW

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:50.746 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:51.580 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS YEAR AS I MENTIONED

01:20:50.746 --> 01:20:53.582 region:rollup2
OF THE FIRST TIME THAT.

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:56.285 region:rollup2
.

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:59.955 region:rollup2
LEGAL ADVICE WAS SOUGHT.

01:20:56.285 --> 01:21:01.623 region:rollup2
ON ON THE AUDITOR'S ROLE.

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:03.959 region:rollup2

GOT FULL AUTHORITY.

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:10.165 region:rollup2
TO GO THROUGH EVERYTHING.

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:10.632 region:rollup2
SO THE THE. OF THE UC OP OFFICE

01:21:10.165 --> 01:21:13.702 region:rollup2
KNEW THAT THE SCALPERS

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:14.770 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY.

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:18.073 region:rollup2
UNLIMITED MOVIES OR IS THIS A

01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:18.474 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCY. REVIEWING A STATE

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:21.043 region:rollup2
AGENCIES I THINK.

01:21:18.474 --> 01:21:23.579 region:rollup2
.

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:25.013 region:rollup2
IF THEY INTENDED TO TO FIGHT

01:21:23.579 --> 01:21:26.548 region:rollup2
THAT BATTLE WAS GOING TO BE A

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:27.382 region:rollup2
LOSING CAUSE YOU ANSWERED THE

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:30.219 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND THEY'RE ACTING

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:31.887 region:rollup2
UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THIS

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:36.291 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE BODY AND STATE LAW

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:38.660 region:rollup2
NO. THANK YOU.

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:41.463 region:rollup2
MR LIVING DID YOU WANT TO GO TO

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:43.932 region:rollup2
LATIN AMERICA FIRST OKAY.

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:45.868 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK YOU JUSTICE. THE

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:46.068 region:rollup2
THE IN LOOKING AT THE WAY THAT

01:21:45.868 --> 01:21:47.970 region:rollup2
THE.

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:49.138 region:rollup2
THE AUDITOR AND THE CAMPUS IS

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:52.007 region:rollup2
ALL BEHAVED.

01:21:49.138 --> 01:21:53.475 region:rollup2
IT.

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:55.244 region:rollup2
COSMAN REFLECT A LITTLE BIT ON

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:57.279 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF HIGHER

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:58.280 region:rollup2
EDUCATION WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:21:57.279 --> 01:21:59.882 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMUNITY

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.449 region:rollup2
COLLEGE SYSTEM HAS A STATEWIDE

01:21:59.882 --> 01:22:03.152 region:rollup2
GOVERNING BOARD BUT WE ALSO

01:22:00.449 --> 01:22:04.753 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:22:03.152 --> 01:22:06.221 region:rollup2
AND MANY MORE DISTRICTS THAT

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:07.656 region:rollup2
HAVE THEIR OWN GOVERNING BOARDS

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:08.290 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE SEPARATE AND

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:09.224 region:rollup2
DISTINCT INSTITUTIONS AND THAT

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:10.793 region:rollup2
WAY. YOU SEE IS.

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:13.228 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT

01:22:10.793 --> 01:22:15.230 region:rollup2
AND IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS BUT

01:22:13.228 --> 01:22:17.599 region:rollup2
TIED TO A PARTICULAR TO SEEN.

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:17.933 region:rollup2
MORE AS A AS A SYSTEM. ORGANISM

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:19.635 region:rollup2
IF YOU WELL.

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:21.170 region:rollup2
AND.

01:22:19.635 --> 01:22:22.538 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT THE QUESTION

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:24.273 region:rollup2
I HAD IN AND.

01:22:22.538 --> 01:22:25.874 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE INTERNAL

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:27.109 region:rollup2
SHARING OF A SURVEY THAT SENATOR

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:28.944 region:rollup2
ALLEN HAD REMARKED ABOUT WHICH

01:22:27.109 --> 01:22:30.579 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:32.147 region:rollup2
BOB PERHAPS CAUSED FOR SOME OF

01:22:30.579 --> 01:22:33.649 region:rollup2
THIS CONFUSION. BUT THAT.

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:36.418 region:rollup2
THE INSTITUTION PERHAPS USUALLY

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:37.286 region:rollup2
ACTS AS A SYSTEM RATHER THAN AS

01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:38.720 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT CAMPUSES.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:39.521 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENTLY.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.990 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT STARKLY

01:22:39.521 --> 01:22:42.958 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FROM. THE.

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:44.726 region:rollup2
BIKINI COLLEGE SYSTEM.

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:46.695 region:rollup2
AND THAT PERHAPS

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:48.997 region:rollup2
NOT HAVING.

01:22:46.695 --> 01:22:50.833 region:rollup2
CLEAR DIRECTION WHETHER IT WAS

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:51.633 region:rollup2
FROM THE AUDITOR PERHAPS THERE

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:53.035 region:rollup2
WAS KERN OBSTRUCTION FROM FROM

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:54.369 region:rollup2
THE AUDITOR BUT BECAUSE. THE

01:22:53.035 --> 01:22:55.737 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AS A WHOLE IS NOT USED TO

01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:57.906 region:rollup2
ACTING.

01:22:55.737 --> 01:23:00.275 region:rollup2
HAS THE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT

01:22:57.906 --> 01:23:01.710 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES AND WITH ARE THIS TYPE

01:23:00.275 --> 01:23:03.779 region:rollup2
OF INTERACTION OF THE STATE

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:05.180 region:rollup2
AGENCY KNOW. THAT BACK HAVE BEEN

01:23:03.779 --> 01:23:06.882 region:rollup2
A CAUSE FOR CONFUSION AND

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:10.485 region:rollup2
MISCOMMUNICATION THAT

01:23:06.882 --> 01:23:12.588 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE WHAT TO US.

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:14.890 region:rollup2
LET ME THINK I LOVE I AGREE MEAN

01:23:12.588 --> 01:23:16.959 region:rollup2
THERE'S A. THERE'S A CERTAIN

01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:19.194 region:rollup2
AMOUNT AND I'M NOT REALLY THE

01:23:16.959 --> 01:23:20.929 region:rollup2
EXTRA HOMELESS BUT.

01:23:19.194 --> 01:23:22.598 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CERTAIN NOT AUTONOMY

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:25.167 region:rollup2
AMONG THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES

01:23:22.598 --> 01:23:26.935 region:rollup2
AND NAY DEPEND ON THE STYLE OF.

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:29.071 region:rollup2
OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:31.006 region:rollup2

IS IT THE UNIFIED STRUCTURE

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:33.809 region:rollup2
THINK YOU'RE HERE HINTING AT

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:36.979 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:23:33.809 --> 01:23:38.447 region:rollup2
LOVE. SO AND I DON'T KNOW HOW.

01:23:36.979 --> 01:23:39.515 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT CHANGE OVER TIME WITH

01:23:38.447 --> 01:23:40.849 region:rollup2
WHOEVER'S

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:42.251 region:rollup2
WELL THE PRESIDENT.

01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:43.418 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WIDE.

01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:44.786 region:rollup2

INDIVIDUAL CAMPUS WHICH I THINK

01:24:30.599 --> 01:24:34.136 region:rollup2
PERHAPS WOULD BE.

01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:36.805 region:rollup2
MAYBE MORE APPROPRIATE WITH THAT

AS THE TRIER OF FACT.

01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:46.541 region:rollup2
MAKING A DETERMINATION.

01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:50.491 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:38:48.322 --> 01:38:52.293 region:rollup2
OUR STAFFS DO OR SEE OUR CHIEF

01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:54.962 region:rollup2
OF STAFF SABRINA DO. A BASED ON

01:38:52.293 --> 01:38:57.265 region:rollup2
THE APPENDICES BASED ON WHAT

YOU'VE WRITTEN.

01:38:57.265 --> 01:39:02.103 region:rollup2
ON. HER HORROR ACTIONS ALIGNED

01:39:00.802 --> 01:39:03.738 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR ACTIONS

01:39:02.103 --> 01:39:04.305 region:rollup2
IN THE SENSE THAT SHE. SHOULD

01:39:03.738 --> 01:39:05.406 region:rollup2
OUT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:06.040 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR'S.

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:07.475 region:rollup2
SHE TALKED ABOUT CONTROLLING THE

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:11.145 region:rollup2
SURVEYS

01:39:07.475 --> 01:39:13.981 region:rollup2
SHE INDICATED THAT HOME.

01:39:11.145 --> 01:39:14.582 region:rollup2
THAT SURVEYS NEEDED TO BE ON

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:15.850 region:rollup2
THEM WRITTEN IN A CERTAIN WAY

01:39:14.582 --> 01:39:18.820 region:rollup2
TO.

01:39:15.850 --> 01:39:21.722 region:rollup2
.

01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:22.623 region:rollup2
TWO IOTA.

01:39:21.722 --> 01:39:23.991 region:rollup2
SHARE INTIMATE THATTHEY NEEDED

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:25.126 region:rollup2
TERM SORT OF THE BRITAIN IN A

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:26.627 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR WAY WHICH IS VERY

01:39:25.126 --> 01:39:28.629 region:rollup2
MUCH IN LINE WITH HER TO

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:30.465 region:rollup2
SUBORDINATES.

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:30.998 region:rollup2
WELL LET ME JUST SAY TWO THINGS

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:33.467 region:rollup2
ONE PASSED THROUGH TAKING

01:39:30.998 --> 01:39:35.236 region:rollup2
CONTROL. OF I BELIEVE IT WAS IN

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:36.237 region:rollup2
THE CONTEXT OF THE.

01:39:35.236 --> 01:39:38.606 region:rollup2
LOVE AUDITOR'S PRESENCE IN THE

01:39:36.237 --> 01:39:42.310 region:rollup2
BUILDING THAT.

01:39:38.606 --> 01:39:44.045 region:rollup2
SHE FELT THAT THINGS WERE OUT OF

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:46.848 region:rollup2
CONTROL ASSEMBLY DID ASK YOUR.

01:39:44.045 --> 01:39:50.117 region:rollup2
YOU CAN ASK HER.

01:39:46.848 --> 01:39:51.118 region:rollup2
GOT WITH THE SECOND THINK THAT

01:39:50.117 --> 01:39:52.520 region:rollup2
YOU'RE THE SAME LITTLE FELLOW

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:53.654 region:rollup2
SETTING WAS RIGHT IN THE DINNER

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:55.957 region:rollup2
AND THE DIRECTION TO OUR CHANCES

01:39:53.654 --> 01:39:58.259 region:rollup2
WERE AGAIN HER THAT THE. GOING

01:39:55.957 --> 01:40:00.194 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE SPECIFICS OF YOUR

01:39:58.259 --> 01:40:02.864 region:rollup2
* HE'S VERY MUCH.

01:40:00.194 --> 01:40:05.967 region:rollup2
HUNG HER ACTIONS WERE VERY MUCH

01:40:02.864 --> 01:40:07.802 region:rollup2
ALIGNED WITH HER STAFF ACTIONS I

01:40:05.967 --> 01:40:08.002 region:rollup2
REMEMBERED THE SECOND YES YOU

01:40:07.802 --> 01:40:09.604 region:rollup2
KNOW.

01:40:08.002 --> 01:40:10.571 region:rollup2
AS I INDICATED THE BEGINNING.

01:40:09.604 --> 01:40:12.373 region:rollup2
.

01:40:10.571 --> 01:40:14.141 region:rollup2
THE CHILLING EFFECT.

01:40:12.373 --> 01:40:15.243 region:rollup2
I MEAN EVEN AT THE.

01:40:14.141 --> 01:40:16.677 region:rollup2
SUBORDINATE POSITIONS BELOW THE

01:40:15.243 --> 01:40:17.178 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR WHEN.

01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:18.846 region:rollup2
PERSON KNOWS THAT THEIR

01:40:17.178 --> 01:40:21.249 region:rollup2
SUPERIOR.

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:21.849 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA BE. REVEALING.

01:40:21.249 --> 01:40:23.484 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW YOU'RE A CERTAIN

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:24.685 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF CIRCUMSPECTION.

01:40:23.484 --> 01:40:26.554 region:rollup2
NATURALLY AND I THINK THE SAME

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:27.088 region:rollup2
THING WHEN.

01:40:26.554 --> 01:40:28.022 region:rollup2
SUBORDINATES LOW WHO ARE

01:40:27.088 --> 01:40:31.092 region:rollup2
WORKING.

01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:34.662 region:rollup2
WITH THE PRESIDENT.

01:40:31.092 --> 01:40:36.597 region:rollup2
THINKER AND AGAIN I'M NOT USE

01:40:34.662 --> 01:40:39.534 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT'S HUMAN NATURE BUT.

01:40:36.597 --> 01:40:40.735 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY'VE. MADE A BELIEVE

01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:42.103 region:rollup2
THE WRAPPING AT HER BEHEST

01:40:40.735 --> 01:40:43.404 region:rollup2
INTERACTIONS WERE CONSISTENT.

01:40:42.103 --> 01:40:45.006 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN THERE'S NO DIRECT

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:46.207 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE IN MY VIEW. THAT WOULD

01:40:45.006 --> 01:40:48.242 region:rollup2
IMPLICATE HER AT LEAST IN MY.

01:40:46.207 --> 01:40:49.577 region:rollup2
.

01:40:48.242 --> 01:40:51.312 region:rollup2
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO CONFIDENTLY

01:40:49.577 --> 01:40:53.414 region:rollup2
CONCLUDE SHE KNEW ABOUT THOSE.

01:40:51.312 --> 01:40:54.415 region:rollup2
.

01:40:53.414 --> 01:40:56.617 region:rollup2
FACTORS THREE.

01:40:54.415 --> 01:40:57.785 region:rollup2
AND FOR.

01:40:56.617 --> 01:40:59.587 region:rollup2
TELL WHETHER AGAIN THIS IS

01:40:57.785 --> 01:41:01.422 region:rollup2
SOMETHING YOU CAN POST HER

01:40:59.587 --> 01:41:03.424 region:rollup2
WHETHER SHE SHOULD HAVE NEW NO.

01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:04.725 region:rollup2
THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION.

01:41:03.424 --> 01:41:06.961 region:rollup2
BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT.

01:41:04.725 --> 01:41:08.629 region:rollup2
.

01:41:06.961 --> 01:41:09.997 region:rollup2
WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW CHIEF OF

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:11.365 region:rollup2
STAFF ARE DOING AND THEY THINK

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:13.034 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING THINGS AT THE.

01:41:11.365 --> 01:41:15.102 region:rollup2
AT THE BEHEST OF.

01:41:13.034 --> 01:41:18.506 region:rollup2
THEIR BOSS BUT IN FACT THAT.

01:41:15.102 --> 01:41:20.308 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZATION BILL THAT EXTEND.

01:41:18.506 --> 01:41:22.176 region:rollup2
IS NOT THERE ARE CERTAINLY NOT

01:41:20.308 --> 01:41:23.344 region:rollup2
EXPLICITLY.

01:41:22.176 --> 01:41:26.647 region:rollup2
BUT BUT WHICH WOULD YOU AGREE

01:41:23.344 --> 01:41:28.149 region:rollup2
THAT HER HER ACTIONS ALSO SEEM

01:41:26.647 --> 01:41:29.583 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH HER STAFF

01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:31.519 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW CURIOUS

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:33.955 region:rollup2
OVERALL BIG PICTURE I THINK YOU

01:41:31.519 --> 01:41:34.789 region:rollup2
COULD CERTAINLY ARGUE THAT.

01:41:33.955 --> 01:41:36.691 region:rollup2
YOU ONE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE

01:41:34.789 --> 01:41:37.959 region:rollup2
TALKING WE'RE TRYING TO IT WE

01:41:36.691 --> 01:41:39.460 region:rollup2
THAT THE SURVEY'S WORTH THE

01:41:37.959 --> 01:41:39.694 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S DIRECTION TO TRY

01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:41.629 region:rollup2
TO GET.

01:41:39.694 --> 01:41:43.431 region:rollup2
FAX

01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:45.566 region:rollup2
NO AND I THINK THE OVERALL

01:41:43.431 --> 01:41:45.1000 region:rollup2
CONCERN IS THAT THERE WAS A

01:41:45.566 --> 01:41:47.401 region:rollup2
COVER UP THERE WAS A

01:41:45.1000 --> 01:41:50.304 region:rollup2
FABRICATION.

01:41:47.401 --> 01:41:51.872 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A INTENTION TO HOME

01:41:50.304 --> 01:41:53.674 region:rollup2
KEEP THE FACTS AWAY FROM THE

01:41:51.872 --> 01:41:55.576 region:rollup2
AUDITOR INNOCENCE KEEPING THE

01:41:53.674 --> 01:41:57.578 region:rollup2
FACTS WHICH IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:41:55.576 --> 01:41:59.780 region:rollup2
KEEPING THE WAY FOR THE POPULAR.

01:41:57.578 --> 01:42:00.881 region:rollup2
LATE ME NO I CAN'T. I CAN'T

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:02.583 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH THAT TO THE EXTENT.

01:42:00.881 --> 01:42:04.118 region:rollup2
THE PRESIDENT IS INVOLVED.

01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:04.585 region:rollup2
THAT SHE HAD THAT INTENT LIKE I

01:42:04.118 --> 01:42:08.489 region:rollup2
JUST CAN'T SAY THAT.

01:42:04.585 --> 01:42:10.691 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:42:08.489 --> 01:42:11.659 region:rollup2
I'M LIKE I DID ONE ALONE HOUSE

01:42:10.691 --> 01:42:13.561 region:rollup2
THERE IN GOING THROUGH THE

01:42:11.659 --> 01:42:15.262 region:rollup2
APPENDICES THERE IS ANOTHER.

01:42:13.561 --> 01:42:16.631 region:rollup2
STAFF PERSON I WAS.

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:19.266 region:rollup2

01:42:16.631 --> 01:42:21.235 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TOM TIMES BUT HE

01:45:34.061 --> 01:45:37.832 region:rollup2
IT WENT BEYOND THAT.

01:45:36.664 --> 01:45:39.500 region:rollup2

SHORT TERM.

01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:50.864 region:rollup2
I JUST KNOW THAT IN THIS CASE

01:47:49.496 --> 01:47:52.399 region:rollup2

QUESTIONS AND I COME WHAT ABOUT

01:48:04.712 --> 01:48:10.250 region:rollup2
THAT JUST REALLY QUICKLY TO THE

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:13.220 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE WERE.

01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:15.923 region:rollup2
HEREIN APRIL WHICH WAS NOT TO

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:17.558 region:rollup2
SPEAK ABOUT THE NON DISCLOSED.

01:48:15.923 --> 01:48:21.462 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE

01:48:17.558 --> 01:48:27.134 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE BUDGET

01:48:21.462 --> 01:48:29.069 region:rollup2
AND AND THEN WHAT CAME AFTER AS

01:48:27.134 --> 01:48:30.537 region:rollup2
FAR AS THE AUDIT.

01:48:29.069 --> 01:48:32.206 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT.

01:48:30.537 --> 01:48:35.008 region:rollup2
AND I WILL PARTICIPATED IN THAT

01:48:32.206 --> 01:48:36.310 region:rollup2
HEARING AND IN THE SPRING WAS A.

01:48:35.008 --> 01:48:38.212 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH WAS REPORTED TO THE

01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:39.780 region:rollup2
REGENTS HOW MUCH DID THE

01:48:38.212 --> 01:48:41.515 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE KNOW MOUNT THOSE

01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:44.118 region:rollup2
FUNDS AND I THINK THE CONCERN

01:48:41.515 --> 01:48:47.054 region:rollup2
FOR MANY OF US HAS BEEN THAT HOW

01:48:44.118 --> 01:48:49.823 region:rollup2
WE ALL ARE? BELIEVERS IN THE UC

01:48:47.054 --> 01:48:52.693 region:rollup2
* OF SYSTEM MANY OF US HAVE

01:48:49.823 --> 01:48:54.695 region:rollup2
ATTENDED. A COLLEGE THERE BUT

01:48:52.693 --> 01:48:56.063 region:rollup2
ALSO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND

01:48:54.695 --> 01:48:57.998 region:rollup2
CAL STATES.

01:48:56.063 --> 01:49:00.567 region:rollup2
AND EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS IF YOU

01:48:57.998 --> 01:49:01.635 region:rollup2
WANT TO SAY IT THAT WAY. AND WE

01:49:00.567 --> 01:49:04.505 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MAKE VERY.

01:49:01.635 --> 01:49:05.739 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT DECISIONS AS HOW MUCH

01:49:04.505 --> 01:49:08.342 region:rollup2
EACH INSTITUTION IS GOING TO BE

01:49:05.739 --> 01:49:09.476 region:rollup2
FUNDED SO TEND TO.

01:49:08.342 --> 01:49:12.546 region:rollup2
QUESTION A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:49:09.476 --> 01:49:13.847 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION AND IS THAT REALLY.

01:49:12.546 --> 01:49:16.083 region:rollup2
SHOULD OF IT AND HAVE BEEN

01:49:13.847 --> 01:49:18.419 region:rollup2
DISCLOSED OR NOT. I THINK FOR ME

01:49:16.083 --> 01:49:21.088 region:rollup2
WAS KIND OF A RED FLAG OF WELL

01:49:18.419 --> 01:49:24.925 region:rollup2
WHY WASN'T THAT AND I KNOW I

01:49:21.088 --> 01:49:27.494 region:rollup2
FELT AS IF A.

01:49:24.925 --> 01:49:28.629 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WAS A SERIOUS A PIECE

01:49:27.494 --> 01:49:30.130 region:rollup2
OF INFORMATION THAT SHOULD HAVE

01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:34.101 region:rollup2
BEEN DISCLOSED.

01:49:30.130 --> 01:49:35.869 region:rollup2
BUT THEN READING YOUR ANALYSIS

01:49:34.101 --> 01:49:37.771 region:rollup2
AND AS IF YOU WOULD SAY YOU

01:49:35.869 --> 01:49:39.706 region:rollup2
CAN'T COME TO THE ULTIMATE

01:49:37.771 --> 01:49:41.842 region:rollup2
CONCLUSION THAT.

01:49:39.706 --> 01:49:44.111 region:rollup2
ON ALL FOUR ITEMS AND YOU

01:49:41.842 --> 01:49:44.912 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THERE WAS IF YOU WANT

01:49:44.111 --> 01:49:48.849 region:rollup2
TO SAY.

01:49:44.912 --> 01:49:51.652 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS EVERYBODY IT DOES

01:49:48.849 --> 01:49:54.421 region:rollup2
CREATE A PATTERN FOR ME MA THAT

01:49:51.652 --> 01:49:56.857 region:rollup2
ONE COULD. INFER THAT.

01:49:54.421 --> 01:49:58.625 region:rollup2
.

01:49:56.857 --> 01:50:00.894 region:rollup2
IT JUST PUTTING IT AS SIMPLY AS

01:49:58.625 --> 01:50:03.063 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE THAT NGUYEN A SURVEY

01:50:00.894 --> 01:50:06.366 region:rollup2
TAKES PLACE IN ONE OF THE BEST.

01:50:03.063 --> 01:50:07.968 region:rollup2
RESULTS POSSIBLE I KNOW. FIFTY

01:50:06.366 --> 01:50:10.170 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS IS QUITE LENGTHY BUT

01:50:07.968 --> 01:50:13.073 region:rollup2
MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOW EVEN.

01:50:10.170 --> 01:50:15.142 region:rollup2
K. TWELVE OR DOING SURVEYS OF

01:50:13.073 --> 01:50:16.777 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR OWN TEACHERS AND A LOT

01:50:15.142 --> 01:50:18.178 region:rollup2
OF MEMBERS BECOME.

01:50:16.777 --> 01:50:19.680 region:rollup2
TEACHERS THEMSELVES DON'T EVEN

01:50:18.178 --> 01:50:20.848 region:rollup2
WANT TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE

01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:23.150 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALWAYS AFRAID THAT

01:50:20.848 --> 01:50:24.384 region:rollup2
RESULTS ARE GOING TO GET OUT AND

01:50:23.150 --> 01:50:26.520 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ANONYMOUS

01:50:24.384 --> 01:50:27.287 region:rollup2
OR IT'S NOT. AND THERE'S ALWAYS

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:28.922 region:rollup2
THE FEAR.

01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:30.224 region:rollup2
THAT IS IT REALLY GOING TO SHED

01:50:28.922 --> 01:50:32.059 region:rollup2
LIGHT ON WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT

01:50:30.224 --> 01:50:33.794 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE. EXACT POINT OF SOME

01:50:32.059 --> 01:50:35.762 region:rollup2
OF THE SURVEYS IS TO FIND OUT

01:50:33.794 --> 01:50:37.898 region:rollup2
REALLY WHAT IS HAPPENING WITHOUT

01:50:35.762 --> 01:50:40.734 region:rollup2
INTERFERENCE AND KIND OF GAUGE

01:50:37.898 --> 01:50:43.504 region:rollup2
IT. BECAUSE IF YOU ASK SOMEBODY

01:50:40.734 --> 01:50:45.339 region:rollup2
FACE TO FACE ON THERE ARE ALWAYS

01:50:43.504 --> 01:50:46.707 region:rollup2
GOING TO SAY HOW THEY REALLY

01:50:45.339 --> 01:50:49.076 region:rollup2
FEEL BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID

01:50:46.707 --> 01:50:51.145 region:rollup2
AGAIN. THAT MAYBE THEIR BOSS OR

01:50:49.076 --> 01:50:54.014 region:rollup2
SUPERINTENDENT OR IN THIS CASE

01:50:51.145 --> 01:50:57.384 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR IS GOING TO THINK

01:50:54.014 --> 01:50:59.853 region:rollup2
POORLY OF THEM SO AS I. HAVE

01:50:57.384 --> 01:51:02.823 region:rollup2
LISTENED TO THE QUESTIONS AS I

01:50:59.853 --> 01:51:04.992 region:rollup2
HAVE LOOKED AT THE REPORT.

01:51:02.823 --> 01:51:10.597 region:rollup2
I GUESS THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU

01:51:04.992 --> 01:51:12.533 region:rollup2
DID SAY THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:14.168 region:rollup2
IN THE OFFICE. OF.

01:51:12.533 --> 01:51:15.903 region:rollup2

INSTITUTIONS GET THEIR GRANTS

01:58:44.451 --> 01:58:47.354 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE HONESTY AND

AUDITOR.

02:08:32.905 --> 02:08:36.509 region:rollup2
I GIVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND

02:08:35.041 --> 02:08:39.645 region:rollup2
REALLY TRYING TO CHANNEL MY

02:08:36.509 --> 02:08:40.680 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS IN HER HER. AND AND

02:08:39.645 --> 02:08:41.714 region:rollup2
FELLOW ALUM.

02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:44.083 region:rollup2
YOUR TIE CAN DEFINITELY BE

02:08:41.714 --> 02:08:46.352 region:rollup2
INTERPRETED AS AT LEAST THREE

02:08:44.083 --> 02:08:48.921 region:rollup2
EUSTICE COUPLES. I'M GONNA GO

02:08:46.352 --> 02:08:50.156 region:rollup2
WITH A COW MIGHT BE IS STILL AND

02:08:48.921 --> 02:08:52.024 region:rollup2
NOT SURE.

02:08:50.156 --> 02:08:56.028 region:rollup2
FIRST IT GOES TO AYE I'D LIKE

02:08:52.024 --> 02:08:58.097 region:rollup2
TO ASK IF IF THERE REGION'S.

02:08:56.028 --> 02:09:00.066 region:rollup2
IF YOU SAW PRESENT APOLLO'S

02:08:58.097 --> 02:09:01.200 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY TO PASS.

02:09:00.066 --> 02:09:02.468 region:rollup2
WHEN THE AUDIT CAME OUT AND WE

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:05.171 region:rollup2
ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WAS

02:09:02.468 --> 02:09:06.739 region:rollup2
YOUR ROLE.

02:09:05.171 --> 02:09:08.641 region:rollup2
I ASKED IS DO YOU JUSTICE MARINO

02:09:06.739 --> 02:09:09.242 region:rollup2
THIS THE SAME QUESTION AS WELL

02:09:08.641 --> 02:09:10.610 region:rollup2
BUT I'M CURIOUS IF THE REGENTS

02:09:09.242 --> 02:09:11.644 region:rollup2
DID.

02:09:10.610 --> 02:09:12.244 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW OF ALL THE REDUCE

02:09:11.644 --> 02:09:15.214 region:rollup2
IT I I CERTAINLY SAW A LOT OF

02:09:12.244 --> 02:09:16.248 region:rollup2
IT.

02:09:15.214 --> 02:09:17.883 region:rollup2
AND AND PERHAPS NOT ALL. BUT.

02:09:16.248 --> 02:09:19.452 region:rollup2
.

02:09:17.883 --> 02:09:21.187 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON I'M ASKING IS

02:09:19.452 --> 02:09:22.521 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU

02:09:21.187 --> 02:09:24.991 region:rollup2
I DID NOT BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT

02:09:22.521 --> 02:09:26.692 region:rollup2
WAS FORTHRIGHT. WITH US IN THAT

02:09:24.991 --> 02:09:28.461 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY I'VE GONE BACK

02:09:26.692 --> 02:09:29.962 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE TIMES AND LOOKED AT THE

02:09:28.461 --> 02:09:30.997 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED ABOUT

02:09:29.962 --> 02:09:32.398 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE OF INTERFERENCE

02:09:30.997 --> 02:09:35.134 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS SO CENTRAL TO OUR

02:09:32.398 --> 02:09:36.836 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO. FIND OUT HOW WE CAN.

02:09:35.134 --> 02:09:38.404 region:rollup2
DO BETTER BY YOU SEE NOT JUST

02:09:36.836 --> 02:09:41.340 region:rollup2
WITH FUNNY BUT IMPROVEMENTS.

02:09:38.404 --> 02:09:42.341 region:rollup2
AND I JUST FLAT OUT ASKED DO

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:44.076 region:rollup2
WORK WHERE THERE SURVEYS

02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:45.878 region:rollup2
RECALLED AT YOUR DIRECTION AND

02:09:44.076 --> 02:09:47.780 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER WAS NO.

02:09:45.878 --> 02:09:49.515 region:rollup2
AND WHAT CONCERNS ME IS AN ONLY

02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:50.983 region:rollup2
WHAT CAME OUT HAVE THAT THIS

02:09:49.515 --> 02:09:52.618 region:rollup2
REPORT AND THE WHOLE INCIDENT

02:09:50.983 --> 02:09:55.388 region:rollup2
BUT WAS THE CONDUCT TOWARDS THE

02:09:52.618 --> 02:09:55.988 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE EVEN AFTER THE FACT.

02:09:55.388 --> 02:09:58.157 region:rollup2
AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL

02:09:55.988 --> 02:09:59.292 region:rollup2
REGIONS

02:09:58.157 --> 02:10:00.960 region:rollup2
TO GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT

02:09:59.292 --> 02:10:02.028 region:rollup2
THAT AS THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT

02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:03.462 region:rollup2
HOW TO MOVE FORWARD AND REBUILD

02:10:02.028 --> 02:10:04.497 region:rollup2
CREDIBILITY.

02:10:03.462 --> 02:10:06.766 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST THE DISAPPOINTMENT

02:10:04.497 --> 02:10:09.068 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO BEGIN WITH.

02:10:06.766 --> 02:10:10.770 region:rollup2
AND WE JUST HEARD FROM THE THE

02:10:09.068 --> 02:10:13.139 region:rollup2
JUSTICE THAT TWO OF THE FOUR.

02:10:10.770 --> 02:10:14.640 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT WENT OFF OF THE

02:10:13.139 --> 02:10:15.941 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT HE JUST IS QUITE

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:17.610 region:rollup2
CERTAIN SHE WAS INVOLVED IN ITS

02:10:15.941 --> 02:10:19.211 region:rollup2
IT IS CAN CONCLUDE ON THE THREE

02:10:17.610 --> 02:10:20.746 region:rollup2
AND FOUR.

02:10:19.211 --> 02:10:22.548 region:rollup2
ITEMS BUT.

02:10:20.746 --> 02:10:25.284 region:rollup2
THAT ALONE WOULD HAVE BEEN.

02:10:22.548 --> 02:10:27.053 region:rollup2
IN MY VIEW REASON TO TO KNOW TO

02:10:25.284 --> 02:10:28.087 region:rollup2
TURN THE PAGE AND I DO THINK THE

02:10:27.053 --> 02:10:29.088 region:rollup2
UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO

02:10:28.087 --> 02:10:30.823 region:rollup2
TURN THE PAGE AND LEADERSHIP

02:10:29.088 --> 02:10:32.625 region:rollup2
WITH THE PRESIDENT.

02:10:30.823 --> 02:10:33.192 region:rollup2
BUT NOT BEING FORTHRIGHT WITH

02:10:32.625 --> 02:10:34.860 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATURE IS ALSO AN

02:10:33.192 --> 02:10:36.629 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:37.096 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT IS AN ASK FIRST OF

02:10:36.629 --> 02:10:39.231 region:rollup2
ALL THAT THAT I REALLY

02:10:37.096 --> 02:10:41.233 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND.

02:10:39.231 --> 02:10:44.203 region:rollup2
THE NEXT IS.

02:10:41.233 --> 02:10:46.005 region:rollup2
WHEN THE REPORT CAME OUT.

02:10:44.203 --> 02:10:47.907 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF REPORT THERE WAS.

02:10:46.005 --> 02:10:49.241 region:rollup2
EXTENSIVE

02:10:47.907 --> 02:10:51.043 region:rollup2
I THINK ABOUT FOUR FIVE HOURS OF

02:10:49.241 --> 02:10:52.712 region:rollup2
CLOSED SESSION THAT THE YOUR

02:10:51.043 --> 02:10:53.813 region:rollup2
REGION'S HAD WITH PRESIDENT

02:10:52.712 --> 02:10:55.715 region:rollup2
APOLLO TIME NOW BUT THERE IS.

02:10:53.813 --> 02:10:57.850 region:rollup2
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY

02:10:55.715 --> 02:10:59.952 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY NO. QUESTIONING IN

02:10:57.850 --> 02:11:00.953 region:rollup2
PUBLIC OF THE PRESIDENT ABOUT

02:10:59.952 --> 02:11:02.588 region:rollup2
THE INTERFERENCE THERE'S NOTHING

02:11:00.953 --> 02:11:05.925 region:rollup2
FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE.

02:11:02.588 --> 02:11:06.792 region:rollup2
AND C. CANDIDLY HER EXPLANATION.

02:11:05.925 --> 02:11:07.526 region:rollup2
IF IT WAS DIFFERENT WHEN I WAS

02:11:06.792 --> 02:11:09.328 region:rollup2
TO THE LEGISLATURE WAS IN THE

02:11:07.526 --> 02:11:10.363 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE.

02:11:09.328 --> 02:11:11.297 region:rollup2
AND I'M WONDERING WHAT WAS THE

02:11:10.363 --> 02:11:12.965 region:rollup2
RATIONALE FOR THAT I CERTAINLY

02:11:11.297 --> 02:11:14.233 region:rollup2
KNOW A LOT OF CLOSE SESSIONS

02:11:12.965 --> 02:11:15.401 region:rollup2
TEND TO BE MORE PERSONNEL

02:11:14.233 --> 02:11:16.936 region:rollup2
RELATED. YOU KNOW PRIVATE OR

02:11:15.401 --> 02:11:19.305 region:rollup2
MAYBE LEGAL MATTERS AND AND

02:11:16.936 --> 02:11:22.074 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:11:19.305 --> 02:11:23.442 region:rollup2
BUT WHY WAS THAT CAN YOU I MIGHT

02:11:22.074 --> 02:11:24.577 region:rollup2
NOT SO Y. IT WITH THEIR WRISTS.

02:11:23.442 --> 02:11:26.579 region:rollup2
QUESTIONING IN PUBLIC AS I

02:11:24.577 --> 02:11:27.880 region:rollup2
RECALL ABOUT THE INTERFERENCE

02:11:26.579 --> 02:11:31.050 region:rollup2
FOR CALIFORNIANS TO UNDERSTAND

02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:32.151 region:rollup2
BETTER.

02:11:31.050 --> 02:11:34.019 region:rollup2
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND.

02:11:32.151 --> 02:11:34.754 region:rollup2
MAYBE IF WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT WE

02:11:34.019 --> 02:11:36.655 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

02:11:34.754 --> 02:11:39.191 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY AS WELL OUR FOCUS

02:11:36.655 --> 02:11:42.361 region:rollup2
WAS IN THOSE FIVE HOURS TIME

02:11:39.191 --> 02:11:43.929 region:rollup2
WHICH INCLUDED THE REPORT BY

02:11:42.361 --> 02:11:45.498 region:rollup2
HOUSTON HAD TAKEN MARINO.

02:11:43.929 --> 02:11:47.800 region:rollup2
IT WE INCLUDED ALSO.

02:11:45.498 --> 02:11:49.802 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT AND

02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:51.804 region:rollup2
STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT TO US

02:11:49.802 --> 02:11:51.971 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL COUNSEL AND TO US

02:11:51.804 --> 02:11:53.539 region:rollup2
AND.

02:11:51.971 --> 02:11:55.040 region:rollup2
.

02:11:53.539 --> 02:11:55.274 region:rollup2
LOST TO HIM. AND THEN OUR OWN

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:56.375 region:rollup2
DEBATE.

02:11:55.274 --> 02:11:57.810 region:rollup2
WE LOOKED AT IT AS A PERSONNEL

02:11:56.375 --> 02:11:59.712 region:rollup2
MATTER.

02:11:57.810 --> 02:12:00.246 region:rollup2
ON A SERIOUS PERSONAL MATTER

02:11:59.712 --> 02:12:02.481 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:12:00.246 --> 02:12:04.083 region:rollup2
JUST THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS

02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:05.117 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE MEANINGFUL. ARE

02:12:04.083 --> 02:12:06.986 region:rollup2
FOR US TO GET OUT.

02:12:05.117 --> 02:12:07.486 region:rollup2
WOULD BE QUESTIONS THAT WERE

02:12:06.986 --> 02:12:07.887 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE FOR A CLOSED

02:12:07.486 --> 02:12:10.356 region:rollup2
SESSION.

02:12:07.887 --> 02:12:12.591 region:rollup2
.

02:12:10.356 --> 02:12:14.126 region:rollup2
WE DID HAVE A.

02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:15.694 region:rollup2
AS I SAID I'VE. READ A

02:12:14.126 --> 02:12:17.563 region:rollup2
STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD

02:12:15.694 --> 02:12:19.031 region:rollup2
ADMONISHING THE PRESIDENT WHAT

02:12:17.563 --> 02:12:19.598 region:rollup2
YOU DID TO HAVE BEEN A LOT OF

02:12:19.031 --> 02:12:20.466 region:rollup2
REPORTS IN THE NEWSPAPER AND

02:12:19.598 --> 02:12:22.201 region:rollup2
SHE.

02:12:20.466 --> 02:12:24.436 region:rollup2
BREADED STATEMENT APOLOGIZING.

02:12:22.201 --> 02:12:26.906 region:rollup2
.

02:12:24.436 --> 02:12:29.275 region:rollup2
SO I'M NOT.

02:12:26.906 --> 02:12:31.377 region:rollup2
SURE WHAT WOULD BE A GAINED BY

02:12:29.275 --> 02:12:32.645 region:rollup2
FOG.

02:12:31.377 --> 02:12:34.413 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC THE PUBLIC.

02:12:32.645 --> 02:12:35.881 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION OF THAT BECAUSE WE

02:12:34.413 --> 02:12:38.851 region:rollup2
WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO

02:12:35.881 --> 02:12:41.187 region:rollup2
DEEPER THAN THE SURFACE LEVEL.

02:12:38.851 --> 02:12:42.454 region:rollup2
BUT IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:12:41.187 --> 02:12:44.190 region:rollup2
PERHAPS WE WELL UP WE WOULD

02:12:42.454 --> 02:12:45.758 region:rollup2
CONSIDER. AND MIGHT HAVE

02:12:44.190 --> 02:12:47.459 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED YEAH AND I APPRECIATE

02:12:45.758 --> 02:12:48.627 region:rollup2
THAT I KNOW THAT I GOT QUESTIONS

02:12:47.459 --> 02:12:49.628 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT FOR MY CONSTITUENTS I

02:12:48.627 --> 02:12:50.863 region:rollup2
CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND

02:12:49.628 --> 02:12:52.865 region:rollup2
WHATEVER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS

02:12:50.863 --> 02:12:53.632 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED TO BE ASKED. TOTALLY

02:12:52.865 --> 02:12:55.467 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE

02:12:53.632 --> 02:12:57.903 region:rollup2
REGION'S TO DO AND AND WHETHER

02:12:55.467 --> 02:13:00.406 region:rollup2
TO MAKE IT OPEN OR CLOSED TO THE

02:12:57.903 --> 02:13:02.775 region:rollup2
PUBLIC IT IS AS WELL BUT. GIVEN

02:13:00.406 --> 02:13:05.344 region:rollup2
HOW TRANSPARENCY HAS BEEN SUCH

02:13:02.775 --> 02:13:07.279 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE WITH THIS AUDIT AND

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:08.214 region:rollup2
THEN THE INTERFERENCE AND

02:13:07.279 --> 02:13:09.481 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS AUDITS.

02:13:08.214 --> 02:13:11.550 region:rollup2
THAT JUST MADE IT EVEN MORE

02:13:09.481 --> 02:13:13.686 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR.

02:13:11.550 --> 02:13:15.187 region:rollup2
USE MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS TO

02:13:13.686 --> 02:13:18.090 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE THEY COULD READ REAR

02:13:15.187 --> 02:13:18.624 region:rollup2
IN THE TRUSTBUT LET ME DID I I

02:13:18.090 --> 02:13:19.825 region:rollup2
DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT.

02:13:18.624 --> 02:13:21.794 region:rollup2
.

02:13:19.825 --> 02:13:24.096 region:rollup2
THAT IMMEDIATELY UPON.

02:13:21.794 --> 02:13:25.564 region:rollup2
ACTING AND I IT FROM THAT CLOSE

02:13:24.096 --> 02:13:27.733 region:rollup2
SESSION AND THEN REPORTING ON

02:13:25.564 --> 02:13:29.502 region:rollup2
OUR ACTIONS AND THE ACTIONS THAT

CENTRAL. AND.

02:14:56.755 --> 02:14:59.992 region:rollup2
THESE WHOLE SERIES OF THAT'S

VIEWS ON.

02:15:04.463 --> 02:15:08.767 region:rollup2
TO WHAT DEGREE. WE TURN THE

02:15:06.899 --> 02:15:11.003 region:rollup2
PAGE AND HOW REFER TO THOSE.

02:15:08.767 --> 02:15:12.271 region:rollup2

POUNDS OF FLASHER PAGE TURNS.

02:15:12.271 --> 02:15:14.006 region:rollup2
TOM.

02:15:13.606 --> 02:15:16.675 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THINGS.

02:15:14.006 --> 02:15:16.976 region:rollup2
WENT INTO OUR OWN DECISION

02:15:16.675 --> 02:15:18.477 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT.

02:15:16.976 --> 02:15:21.080 region:rollup2
.

02:15:18.477 --> 02:15:23.349 region:rollup2
AND PART OF IT IS THE CONTACT IS

02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:24.483 region:rollup2
AN ENTIRE SET OF. CONTEXTUAL

02:15:23.349 --> 02:15:26.385 region:rollup2
POINTS THAT ARE REFERENCED IN.

02:15:24.483 --> 02:15:28.153 region:rollup2
.

02:15:26.385 --> 02:15:28.921 region:rollup2
THE REPORT BY HOUSTON HANNIGAN

02:15:28.153 --> 02:15:30.923 region:rollup2
MORENO.

02:15:28.921 --> 02:15:32.124 region:rollup2
AND TOUCHED ON. THE GENERAL

02:15:30.923 --> 02:15:35.494 region:rollup2
COUNSEL'S ADVICE.

02:15:32.124 --> 02:15:37.329 region:rollup2
ó WHICH WAS CORRECT WITH

02:15:35.494 --> 02:15:38.597 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO THE.

02:15:37.329 --> 02:15:40.799 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR THE AUDITOR HAD SAID.

02:15:38.597 --> 02:15:41.600 region:rollup2
.

02:15:40.799 --> 02:15:42.701 region:rollup2
I MONTH AND THERE'S A DEAD

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:44.637 region:rollup2
THERE'S A STATUTE IT DOESN'T

02:15:42.701 --> 02:15:46.238 region:rollup2
PERMIT DISCLOSURE BUT APPLIED TO

02:15:44.637 --> 02:15:47.473 region:rollup2
HER NOT TO THE.

02:15:46.238 --> 02:15:49.308 region:rollup2
TO THE UNIVERSITY SO HIS ADVICE

02:15:47.473 --> 02:15:52.678 region:rollup2
WAS CORRECT ON THAT.

02:15:49.308 --> 02:15:53.812 region:rollup2
BY IT WAS HE ALSO SAID I SEXY NO

02:15:52.678 --> 02:15:55.614 region:rollup2
REASON THAT THESE CANNOT BE

02:15:53.812 --> 02:15:56.715 region:rollup2
SHARED.

02:15:55.614 --> 02:15:58.684 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WITH THE SYSTEM.

02:15:56.715 --> 02:16:01.553 region:rollup2
.

02:15:58.684 --> 02:16:03.222 region:rollup2
AND AND SO ALTHOUGH THAT HE ALSO

02:16:01.553 --> 02:16:04.723 region:rollup2
POINTED OUT WAS PROBABLY A

02:16:03.222 --> 02:16:06.558 region:rollup2
POLITICAL CHOICE WAS NOT BE A

02:16:04.723 --> 02:16:08.761 region:rollup2
WISE ONE.

02:16:06.558 --> 02:16:09.795 region:rollup2
SO BUT THERE WAS CONFUSION AND

02:16:08.761 --> 02:16:11.397 region:rollup2
THAT WENT THROUGH THE DEPUTY.

02:16:09.795 --> 02:16:13.032 region:rollup2
CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE CHIEF OF

02:16:11.397 --> 02:16:14.900 region:rollup2
STAFF TO THE PRESIDENT.

02:16:13.032 --> 02:16:16.568 region:rollup2
WE HAD THE CONTEXT OF THE

02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:17.302 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS AUDIT.

02:16:16.568 --> 02:16:19.471 region:rollup2
WE HAD.

02:16:17.302 --> 02:16:21.540 region:rollup2
.

02:16:19.471 --> 02:16:23.175 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON AT THAT

02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:24.677 region:rollup2
TIME I COULD LIST I SORT OF A

02:16:23.175 --> 02:16:25.244 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I I I THOUGHT SOMEONE

02:16:24.677 --> 02:16:26.578 region:rollup2
WOULD ASK THIS QUESTION SOME

02:16:25.244 --> 02:16:28.247 region:rollup2
WAY.

02:16:26.578 --> 02:16:29.915 region:rollup2
AND AND NOT IT WAS.

02:16:28.247 --> 02:16:32.451 region:rollup2
.

02:16:29.915 --> 02:16:34.520 region:rollup2
FAIRLY UNANIMOUS THAT AND IN

02:16:32.451 --> 02:16:35.120 region:rollup2
FACT I WOULD SAY WAS I I DON'T

02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:35.287 region:rollup2
SEE THERE'S ANY OBJECTION BET

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:37.189 region:rollup2
THE

02:16:35.287 --> 02:16:40.759 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT CONTINUE.

02:16:37.189 --> 02:16:43.228 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAD TO ALSO DETERMINE A

02:16:40.759 --> 02:16:45.030 region:rollup2
WAY TOO SOON TO MAKE A MARK ON

02:16:43.228 --> 02:16:46.865 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT HOW SERIOUS THAT WAS

02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:47.733 region:rollup2
AND AND AND. THERE MAY BE

02:16:46.865 --> 02:16:48.967 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE DID

02:16:47.733 --> 02:16:50.269 region:rollup2
THAT PROPERLY OR NOT WE THOUGHT

02:16:48.967 --> 02:16:52.204 region:rollup2
WE DID IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE

02:16:50.269 --> 02:16:53.072 region:rollup2
MOST EFFECTIVE.

02:16:52.204 --> 02:16:54.640 region:rollup2
WE STILL HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE

02:16:53.072 --> 02:16:55.708 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT.

02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:57.710 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE PRESIDENT

02:16:55.708 --> 02:17:00.212 region:rollup2
INTELLIGENCE AND AND DILIGENCE

02:16:57.710 --> 02:17:03.182 region:rollup2
AND AND AND DR.

02:17:00.212 --> 02:17:05.617 region:rollup2
CAN CAN BENEFIT THAT UNIVERSITY.

02:17:03.182 --> 02:17:07.686 region:rollup2
ITEM. WE BELIEVE WE WILL.

02:17:05.617 --> 02:17:08.754 region:rollup2
THAT WILL TAKE PLACE OTHERWISE

02:17:07.686 --> 02:17:11.090 region:rollup2
WE WOULD HAVE GONE WE WOULD HAVE

02:17:08.754 --> 02:17:13.158 region:rollup2
TURNED THE PAGE.

02:17:11.090 --> 02:17:13.425 region:rollup2
ON BOTH BUT THAT'S HOW WE CAME

02:17:13.158 --> 02:17:14.693 region:rollup2
OUT ON IT.

02:17:13.425 --> 02:17:15.794 region:rollup2
.

02:17:14.693 --> 02:17:17.930 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME WE WANTED TO

02:17:15.794 --> 02:17:19.531 region:rollup2
PUT INTO PROCESS IN INTO INTO

02:17:17.930 --> 02:17:21.567 region:rollup2
AFFECT A LOT OF PROCEDURES THAT

02:17:19.531 --> 02:17:23.235 region:rollup2
WE THINK WILL MINIMIZE THE KIND

02:17:21.567 --> 02:17:24.703 region:rollup2
OF CONTEXTUAL THINGS THAT. THAT

02:17:23.235 --> 02:17:27.139 region:rollup2
ADDED TO THE TO THE SITUATION

02:17:24.703 --> 02:17:29.141 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT NOT A DIRECT

02:17:27.139 --> 02:17:31.610 region:rollup2
REPORTS THE DOOR REPORTS WERE.

02:17:29.141 --> 02:17:34.513 region:rollup2
TALK TO THE BOARD ABOUT IT.

02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:36.115 region:rollup2
THESE KIND OF THINGS.

02:17:34.513 --> 02:17:36.415 region:rollup2
WORKED WHERE WHERE WE'RE

02:17:36.115 --> 02:17:38.417 region:rollup2
CORRECTING.

02:17:36.415 --> 02:17:39.485 region:rollup2
.

02:17:38.417 --> 02:17:40.853 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AS I THINK PEOPLE FEEL

02:17:39.485 --> 02:17:42.488 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT IT WHILE WE

02:17:40.853 --> 02:17:43.422 region:rollup2
WERE PRETTY CLEAR THAT WE THINK

02:17:42.488 --> 02:17:45.491 region:rollup2
WE'RE BETTER OFF WITH THE

02:17:43.422 --> 02:17:47.626 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT AND WITHOUT PRESIDENT.

02:17:45.491 --> 02:17:49.061 region:rollup2

APOLOGIZE.

02:17:51.363 --> 02:17:53.832 region:rollup2
IT HELPS WHEN THERE'S

02:17:52.064 --> 02:17:56.034 region:rollup2
FORTHRIGHTNESS.

WAS JUST WITHIN THE RELATIVE HER

02:19:47.212 --> 02:19:49.715 region:rollup2
COURSE OF BUSINESS BETWEEN THE

02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:51.783 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND THE UNIVERSITY.

02:19:49.715 --> 02:19:53.585 region:rollup2
.

02:19:51.783 --> 02:19:55.687 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE IS A

02:19:53.585 --> 02:19:57.289 region:rollup2
FEE OF VERY KEEN AWARENESS ON

02:19:55.687 --> 02:20:00.492 region:rollup2
THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

02:19:57.289 --> 02:20:02.928 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE

02:20:00.492 --> 02:20:03.762 region:rollup2
TO THIS BODY TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:20:02.928 --> 02:20:05.831 region:rollup2
NAM AND OBVIOUSLY TO PUBLIC.

02:20:03.762 --> 02:20:07.766 region:rollup2
.

02:20:05.831 --> 02:20:09.301 region:rollup2

THEY THEY ARE GENERALLY

02:20:11.703 --> 02:20:14.106 region:rollup2
RESPONSIVE.

02:20:12.671 --> 02:20:16.541 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE

02:20:14.106 --> 02:20:19.044 region:rollup2
ANECDOTAL.

02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:20.812 region:rollup2
POINTS ON ON BOTH SIDES.

02:20:19.044 --> 02:20:22.014 region:rollup2
ON THAT POINT.

02:20:20.812 --> 02:20:23.682 region:rollup2
I THINK WITH THE MOST.

02:20:22.014 --> 02:20:25.117 region:rollup2
AND FACT I'VE BEEN TOLD WITH

02:20:23.682 --> 02:20:26.985 region:rollup2
THE MOST TRANSPARENT OPEN

02:20:25.117 --> 02:20:29.721 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY IN THE COUNTRY.

02:20:26.985 --> 02:20:31.256 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MAYBE PARTICULAR.

02:20:29.721 --> 02:20:32.624 region:rollup2
MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE HAVE

02:20:31.256 --> 02:20:33.225 region:rollup2
HAD PARTICULAR ISSUES WITH

02:20:32.624 --> 02:20:34.726 region:rollup2
GETTING INFORMATION THAT THEY

02:20:33.225 --> 02:20:35.994 region:rollup2
WANT.

02:20:34.726 --> 02:20:37.029 region:rollup2
BUT I HAVE NOT.

02:20:35.994 --> 02:20:38.997 region:rollup2
HEARD THAT FROM EVERYONE.

02:20:37.029 --> 02:20:41.133 region:rollup2
.

02:20:38.997 --> 02:20:41.333 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TEN CAMPUSES

02:20:41.133 --> 02:20:43.435 region:rollup2
FIVE.

02:20:41.333 --> 02:20:46.171 region:rollup2
.

02:20:43.435 --> 02:20:48.340 region:rollup2
A HOSPITAL SYSTEMS THREE LAPS I

02:20:46.171 --> 02:20:48.941 region:rollup2
IT'S A BIG EXECUTION AND HALF

02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:51.343 region:rollup2
YOU WANNA FIND.

02:20:48.941 --> 02:20:52.911 region:rollup2
ISSUES THEY WILL BE THERE WE

FIND THEM ALL THE TIME.

02:20:52.911 --> 02:20:57.716 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY PART.

02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:58.884 region:rollup2
AT WHAT WAS ASKED EARLIER ABOUT

02:20:57.716 --> 02:20:59.818 region:rollup2
THE CHILLING EFFECT THAT

02:20:58.884 --> 02:21:00.786 region:rollup2
OCCURRED IN THIS I THINK THAT

02:20:59.818 --> 02:21:02.387 region:rollup2
THERE THERE THERE IS A CHILLING

02:21:00.786 --> 02:21:04.756 region:rollup2
EFFECT WHEN YOU ASK THAT KIND OF

02:21:02.387 --> 02:21:06.725 region:rollup2
A QUESTION.

02:21:04.756 --> 02:21:08.126 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

02:21:06.725 --> 02:21:10.062 region:rollup2
IT WHEN YOU GO THROUGH SOMETHING

02:21:08.126 --> 02:21:12.164 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS THE ENTIRE UNIVERSITY

02:21:10.062 --> 02:21:14.032 region:rollup2
KINDA REACTS TO IT THAT'S ONE.

02:21:12.164 --> 02:21:14.266 region:rollup2
TO WE HAVE A BOARD THAT'S VERY

02:21:14.032 --> 02:21:15.934 region:rollup2
MUCH ON.

02:21:14.266 --> 02:21:18.303 region:rollup2
.

02:21:15.934 --> 02:21:19.738 region:rollup2
ON TOP OF THIS RIGHT NOW.

02:21:18.303 --> 02:21:21.840 region:rollup2
WELL I CAN PAY MY OWN VIEW

02:21:19.738 --> 02:21:23.075 region:rollup2
THOUGH ABOUT THIS AND AND I'LL

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:24.576 region:rollup2
BE CHAIR FOR ANOTHER CUP YOU

02:21:23.075 --> 02:21:25.978 region:rollup2
KNOW THE YEAR AND A HALF.

02:21:24.576 --> 02:21:28.780 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE STRONGLY IN

02:21:25.978 --> 02:21:30.749 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:32.985 region:rollup2
UP HA IT'S JUST WHO I AM I

02:21:30.749 --> 02:21:36.455 region:rollup2
BELIEVE STRONGLY IN OVERSIGHT.

02:21:32.985 --> 02:21:38.056 region:rollup2
AYE HONOR WHAT YOU ALL DO I I I

02:21:36.455 --> 02:21:39.725 region:rollup2
I COULD NOT DO THAT.

02:21:38.056 --> 02:21:41.994 region:rollup2
BUT I DO WHAT I DO.

02:21:39.725 --> 02:21:42.494 region:rollup2
SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A

02:21:41.994 --> 02:21:44.563 region:rollup2
KIND OF PARTNERSHIP THAT

02:21:42.494 --> 02:21:47.265 region:rollup2
EXISTED.

02:21:44.563 --> 02:21:49.434 region:rollup2
I'LL QUITE AWHILE AGO.

02:21:47.265 --> 02:21:50.569 region:rollup2
I THINK THE PARTNERSHIP NOT TO

02:21:49.434 --> 02:21:52.471 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT IT'S FRAYED.

02:21:50.569 --> 02:21:54.072 region:rollup2
MORE RADICALLY RECENTLY BY

02:21:52.471 --> 02:21:56.742 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S VIEWS.

02:21:54.072 --> 02:21:59.077 region:rollup2
BEGAN FRAYING SOMETIME AGO WOULD

02:21:56.742 --> 02:22:00.412 region:rollup2
AND FROM MULTIPLE CAUSES NOW I'M

02:21:59.077 --> 02:22:01.313 region:rollup2
NOT I THINK.

02:22:00.412 --> 02:22:03.115 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT IS.

02:22:01.313 --> 02:22:04.216 region:rollup2
.

02:22:03.115 --> 02:22:05.884 region:rollup2
BUT THE THE RECESSION OF TWO

02:22:04.216 --> 02:22:07.586 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SEVEN AND EIGHT. AND

02:22:05.884 --> 02:22:09.287 region:rollup2
THE FOLLOW ON AND AND THEN THE

02:22:07.586 --> 02:22:11.423 region:rollup2
FINGER POINTING ABOUT TUITION.

02:22:09.287 --> 02:22:12.491 region:rollup2
THAT WAS I THINK THOUGHT OF BY

02:22:11.423 --> 02:22:13.358 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE LEGISLATURE THAT

02:22:12.491 --> 02:22:15.560 region:rollup2
TIME HAS.

02:22:13.358 --> 02:22:16.895 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:18.597 region:rollup2
AND THEN IT SORT OF BECAME MY

02:22:16.895 --> 02:22:19.731 region:rollup2
GOD THERE'S GAMBLING IN CASA

02:22:18.597 --> 02:22:21.099 region:rollup2
BLANCA THERE'S TUITION.

02:22:19.731 --> 02:22:22.868 region:rollup2
WHAT A SURPRISE?

02:22:21.099 --> 02:22:24.236 region:rollup2
?

02:22:22.868 --> 02:22:25.437 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A

02:22:24.236 --> 02:22:27.439 region:rollup2
NEED FOR TRUST AND AND

02:22:25.437 --> 02:22:28.040 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP ON ALL SIDES.

02:22:27.439 --> 02:22:29.674 region:rollup2
I THINK THE BIGGEST BURDENS ON

02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:31.410 region:rollup2
US.

02:22:29.674 --> 02:22:32.477 region:rollup2
GIVEN WHAT'S OCCURRED AND ON THE

02:22:31.410 --> 02:22:35.514 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY.

02:22:32.477 --> 02:22:37.616 region:rollup2
WAS BUT A A CLEAR DIRECTION HAS

02:22:35.514 --> 02:22:39.217 region:rollup2
GONE OUT TO THE CHANCELLOR'S AND

02:22:37.616 --> 02:22:41.119 region:rollup2
THAT THE PRESIDENT FIRST OF ALL.

02:22:39.217 --> 02:22:42.754 region:rollup2
THE BOARD THE CHANCELLOR'S.

02:22:41.119 --> 02:22:44.389 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO BE.

02:22:42.754 --> 02:22:47.325 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE RESPONSIVE AND MUCH

02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:48.894 region:rollup2
MORE QUICKLY MUCH MORE QUICKLY.

02:22:47.325 --> 02:22:50.762 region:rollup2
I RESPONSIVE AND ACCURATE IN OUR

02:22:48.894 --> 02:22:51.730 region:rollup2
RESPONSES SO.

02:22:50.762 --> 02:22:53.031 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WILL TAKE PLACE

02:22:51.730 --> 02:22:54.466 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT SO MANY

02:22:53.031 --> 02:22:56.768 region:rollup2
RULES YOU CAN PUT IN FOR THAT

02:22:54.466 --> 02:22:58.703 region:rollup2
YOU DEVELOP A CULTURE FOR THAT.

02:22:56.768 --> 02:22:59.304 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK THAT CULTURE HAS

02:22:58.703 --> 02:23:00.705 region:rollup2
BEEN THERE I THINK IT'S THEIR

02:22:59.304 --> 02:23:02.674 region:rollup2
LARGELY.

02:23:00.705 --> 02:23:04.042 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HEARD FROM THE HERE ON

02:23:02.674 --> 02:23:06.511 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THE OTHER DAY ABOUT WHAT

02:23:04.042 --> 02:23:08.547 region:rollup2

CAMPUSES AS TO HOW THEY REACTED

02:23:08.547 --> 02:23:11.817 region:rollup2
TO THE SYSTEM OFFICE.

02:23:10.816 --> 02:23:13.185 region:rollup2
NO WHAT THEY TOLD US IS THAT WAS

02:23:11.817 --> 02:23:14.753 region:rollup2

BETTY JONES WAS.

02:23:20.492 --> 02:23:23.328 region:rollup2

02:24:45.577 --> 02:24:47.345 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

02:24:46.478 --> 02:24:49.514 region:rollup2
I IN THE CULMINATION OF THE OF

FROM DUBLIN DISARMING COMMENTS

02:24:54.753 --> 02:24:57.923 region:rollup2
IN THE BUT ALSO MY COMMENTS HOW

02:24:56.054 --> 02:24:59.791 region:rollup2
HOW CAN WE. BE ASSURED THAT THE

02:24:57.923 --> 02:25:02.427 region:rollup2

02:24:59.791 --> 02:25:03.895 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT IT WON'T. ON.

02:25:02.427 --> 02:25:06.965 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW PIECE SOME SORT OF SUGAR

02:25:03.895 --> 02:25:08.600 region:rollup2
COATED DUH VERSION OR SOME SORT

02:25:06.965 --> 02:25:11.770 region:rollup2
OF FOUND. HER FIRST THAT REALLY

02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:14.072 region:rollup2
DOESN'T TAKE A VERY FRANK VIEW

02:25:11.770 --> 02:25:16.641 region:rollup2
OF THIS DUPLICATION ISSUE TO THE

02:25:14.072 --> 02:25:17.776 region:rollup2
VERY ISSUE THE HONOR WASN'T AYE

02:25:16.641 --> 02:25:18.643 region:rollup2
PETARD BECAUSE LOOK AT.

02:25:17.776 --> 02:25:19.177 region:rollup2
I I THINK YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT

02:25:18.643 --> 02:25:20.445 region:rollup2
JUDGMENT WHEN YOU GET THE

02:25:19.177 --> 02:25:22.948 region:rollup2
REPORT.

02:25:20.445 --> 02:25:23.982 region:rollup2
THE I THINK PART OF THE

02:25:22.948 --> 02:25:25.684 region:rollup2
CREDIBILITY COMES FROM THE FACT

02:25:23.982 --> 02:25:27.419 region:rollup2
THAT THE PERSONS WE HAVE TO DO

02:25:25.684 --> 02:25:29.988 region:rollup2
IT. ARE THE IMMEDIATELY

02:25:27.419 --> 02:25:31.289 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE PAST.

02:25:29.988 --> 02:25:33.792 region:rollup2
HEADS OF.

02:25:31.289 --> 02:25:35.360 region:rollup2
ESSAY DOT AND THE DEPUTY.

02:25:33.792 --> 02:25:37.362 region:rollup2
STATE AUDITOR.

02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:39.097 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE PICKED PEOPLE WHO HAVE

02:25:37.362 --> 02:25:40.699 region:rollup2
A LONG HISTORY OF CREDIBILITY

02:25:39.097 --> 02:25:43.034 region:rollup2
WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND

02:25:40.699 --> 02:25:45.370 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICES.

02:25:43.034 --> 02:25:46.237 region:rollup2
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

02:25:45.370 --> 02:25:48.006 region:rollup2
SO I'M HOPEFUL THAT THAT WILL

02:25:46.237 --> 02:25:48.540 region:rollup2
HELP. FOR SOME PEOPLE MAYBE IT

02:25:48.006 --> 02:25:50.809 region:rollup2
WILL NEVER.

02:25:48.540 --> 02:25:52.277 region:rollup2
BE ENOUGH BUT I'M I'M HOPEFUL

02:25:50.809 --> 02:25:53.645 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:25:52.277 --> 02:25:55.447 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WILL PROVIDE

02:25:53.645 --> 02:25:57.148 region:rollup2
CREDIBILITY I THINK IT'LL HOUSE

02:25:55.447 --> 02:25:57.616 region:rollup2
SO HAVE TO BE SEEN IN CONTEXT

02:25:57.148 --> 02:25:59.618 region:rollup2
WITH THE.

02:25:57.616 --> 02:26:01.386 region:rollup2
SURE ON REPORT AND WHAT THEY

02:25:59.618 --> 02:26:04.022 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH HOW DOES THAT CROSS

TO PUT THE BUDGET IN A FORM

02:26:22.874 --> 02:26:26.344 region:rollup2
THAT'S MUCH MORE CONSISTENT WITH

02:26:24.643 --> 02:26:28.813 region:rollup2
HOW YOU USUALLY LOOK AT BUDGETS.

02:26:26.344 --> 02:26:30.582 region:rollup2

02:31:08.459 --> 02:31:12.897 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE HUNTERDON

02:31:11.763 --> 02:31:14.499 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE

02:31:12.897 --> 02:31:16.200 region:rollup2
MILLION ROUGHLY WAS WHAT THE

02:31:14.499 --> 02:31:17.635 region:rollup2
AUDITOR ORDER I THINK WHEN YOU

02:31:16.200 --> 02:31:19.437 region:rollup2
BROKE THAT DOWN.

02:31:17.635 --> 02:31:21.573 region:rollup2
IT.

02:31:19.437 --> 02:31:24.008 region:rollup2
IT IT BECAME A DIFFERENT STORY

02:31:21.573 --> 02:31:24.442 region:rollup2
THAN THE HEADLINE THAT WAS THERE

02:31:24.008 --> 02:31:26.477 region:rollup2
FROM THE BEGINNING.

02:31:24.442 --> 02:31:27.545 region:rollup2
.

02:31:26.477 --> 02:31:28.913 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT HUNDRED

02:31:27.545 --> 02:31:31.983 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WAS

02:31:28.913 --> 02:31:34.352 region:rollup2
NOT THAT IT WAS MISS SPENT.

02:31:31.983 --> 02:31:36.921 region:rollup2
ARE WASTED OR ANY FOUND ANYBODY

02:31:34.352 --> 02:31:37.455 region:rollup2
FOUND ANY SAVINGS AND THAT.

02:31:36.921 --> 02:31:39.390 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS FOUND WAS A AND I

02:31:37.455 --> 02:31:41.125 region:rollup2
THINK?

02:31:39.390 --> 02:31:42.994 region:rollup2
PARTLY OUR AIR AS WELL AS THE

02:31:41.125 --> 02:31:44.262 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT'S AREA.

02:31:42.994 --> 02:31:45.029 region:rollup2
THAT DOES IN FACT THAT THE

02:31:44.262 --> 02:31:46.497 region:rollup2
AUDITOR DIDN'T CRITICIZE ANY

02:31:45.029 --> 02:31:48.099 region:rollup2
OTHER PROGRAMS

02:31:46.497 --> 02:31:49.334 region:rollup2
AND NOBODY DEBATED THE VALUE OF

02:31:48.099 --> 02:31:50.835 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAMS. AND WE KNEW THE

02:31:49.334 --> 02:31:52.804 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS

02:31:50.835 --> 02:31:53.604 region:rollup2
THAT WERE THERE WHAT WE HADN'T

02:31:52.804 --> 02:31:56.007 region:rollup2
DONE AND WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD

02:31:53.604 --> 02:31:57.308 region:rollup2
DONE. WAS BUDGET THOSE PROGRAMS

02:31:56.007 --> 02:31:58.109 region:rollup2
OUT PROPERLY AND BUDGET TO

02:31:57.308 --> 02:32:00.111 region:rollup2
ACTUAL.

02:31:58.109 --> 02:32:02.613 region:rollup2
.

02:32:00.111 --> 02:32:04.015 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WAS DESCRIBED BY THE

02:32:02.613 --> 02:32:07.452 region:rollup2
AUDITOR.

02:32:04.015 --> 02:32:08.920 region:rollup2
AS OF BEING HIDDEN TO VIEW.

02:32:07.452 --> 02:32:11.689 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NOT HAVING BEEN BUDGETED

02:32:08.920 --> 02:32:14.258 region:rollup2
AND THEN ACCOUNTED FOR PROPERLY.

02:32:11.689 --> 02:32:15.159 region:rollup2
I THINK WAS CORRECT.

02:32:14.258 --> 02:32:17.962 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THEY WERE HIDDEN

02:32:15.159 --> 02:32:19.931 region:rollup2
AND THEN PLAYED BY NEWSPAPERS AS

02:32:17.962 --> 02:32:22.800 region:rollup2
A SLUSH FUND WAS ENTIRELY

02:32:19.931 --> 02:32:24.469 region:rollup2
INACCURATE AND UNFAIR. AND LEAD

02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:26.237 region:rollup2
TO TO SERIOUS.

02:32:24.469 --> 02:32:28.106 region:rollup2
MISCONCEPTIONS

02:32:26.237 --> 02:32:29.607 region:rollup2
BY THE PUBLIC CERTAINLY.

02:32:28.106 --> 02:32:31.843 region:rollup2
AND AND OTHERS.

02:32:29.607 --> 02:32:32.610 region:rollup2
SO I.

02:32:31.843 --> 02:32:33.945 region:rollup2
WE ARE GOING TO DO THAT

02:32:32.610 --> 02:32:35.513 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE THOSE

02:32:33.945 --> 02:32:37.348 region:rollup2
ARE ALL GOING TO BE BUDGETED IN

02:32:35.513 --> 02:32:38.549 region:rollup2
ADVANCE.

02:32:37.348 --> 02:32:40.485 region:rollup2
THE FUN THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR.

02:32:38.549 --> 02:32:42.553 region:rollup2
.

02:32:40.485 --> 02:32:43.655 region:rollup2
FOR. SPECIAL INITIATIVES IS

02:32:42.553 --> 02:32:45.256 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE VERY IS RELATIVELY

02:32:43.655 --> 02:32:46.457 region:rollup2
SMALL.

02:32:45.256 --> 02:32:48.693 region:rollup2
AHA AND APPROVALS WILL BE

02:32:46.457 --> 02:32:49.961 region:rollup2
REQUIRED BY THE BOARD CHAIR AND

02:32:48.693 --> 02:32:51.896 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THE BOARD CHAIR OF THE

02:32:49.961 --> 02:32:53.398 region:rollup2
FINANCE CHAIR. AND E. AND THE.

02:32:51.896 --> 02:32:54.465 region:rollup2
.

02:32:53.398 --> 02:32:54.999 region:rollup2
CHAIR THE AUDIT COMPLIANCE

02:32:54.465 --> 02:32:56.434 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE FOR CERTAIN KIND

02:32:54.999 --> 02:32:59.037 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES.

02:32:56.434 --> 02:33:00.872 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT UNFORTUNATE THAT

02:32:59.037 --> 02:33:02.306 region:rollup2
WHEN RAN AWAY WELL FROM US A

02:33:00.872 --> 02:33:03.741 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY AND CREATED A FOR AN

02:33:02.306 --> 02:33:05.843 region:rollup2
IMPRESSION WAS FAR DIFFERENT

02:33:03.741 --> 02:33:07.512 region:rollup2
THAN I THINK THE REALITY. AND

02:33:05.843 --> 02:33:08.713 region:rollup2
THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN OUR IN

02:33:07.512 --> 02:33:10.014 region:rollup2
OUR BUDGETING.

02:33:08.713 --> 02:33:11.716 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO TUITION.

02:33:10.014 --> 02:33:13.184 region:rollup2
THIS WILL ALWAYS BE A DIFFICULT

02:33:11.716 --> 02:33:15.553 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

02:33:13.184 --> 02:33:17.655 region:rollup2
I PROTESTED TUITION UP HERE.

02:33:15.553 --> 02:33:19.457 region:rollup2
AGAINST YOUR PREDECESSORS.

02:33:17.655 --> 02:33:20.625 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS

02:33:19.457 --> 02:33:21.793 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE AT A TIME WHEN I

02:33:20.625 --> 02:33:22.393 region:rollup2
WAS PAYIG VIRTUALLY NOTHING

02:33:21.793 --> 02:33:24.128 region:rollup2
COMPARATIVELY.

02:33:22.393 --> 02:33:24.295 region:rollup2
.

02:33:24.128 --> 02:33:26.998 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:33:24.295 --> 02:33:29.133 region:rollup2
.

02:33:26.998 --> 02:33:30.334 region:rollup2
WE AYE.

02:33:29.133 --> 02:33:31.436 region:rollup2
AT AND THE OTHER FIFTY FIVE

02:33:30.334 --> 02:33:34.972 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS QUALIFY

02:33:31.436 --> 02:33:36.774 region:rollup2
FOR NOTE NO TUITION AS YOU KNOW.

02:33:34.972 --> 02:33:37.842 region:rollup2
I UP TO HUNT AT ABOUT A HUNDRED

02:33:36.774 --> 02:33:39.343 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE OUT YOU'RE GOING TO

02:33:37.842 --> 02:33:41.479 region:rollup2
FAKE PAY FULL TUITION.

02:33:39.343 --> 02:33:43.514 region:rollup2
TOO WE LIKE THIS PROCESS OF

02:33:41.479 --> 02:33:44.816 region:rollup2
RAISING TUITION AYE WE DO NOT

02:33:43.514 --> 02:33:45.950 region:rollup2
AND IT'S THE ONE WE GET THE MOST

02:33:44.816 --> 02:33:49.587 region:rollup2
PRESSURE ON FROM OUR

02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:51.823 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS INCLUDING YOU.

02:33:49.587 --> 02:33:53.658 region:rollup2
BUT OUT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.

02:33:51.823 --> 02:33:54.625 region:rollup2
.

02:33:53.658 --> 02:33:56.127 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF OTHER PRESSURES ON

02:33:54.625 --> 02:33:57.495 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET.

02:33:56.127 --> 02:33:59.597 region:rollup2
THOSE PRESSURES HAVE PUT

02:33:57.495 --> 02:34:01.833 region:rollup2
PRESSURES ON THE UNIVERSITY.

02:33:59.597 --> 02:34:03.968 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU RAISE THE BUDGET FOR

02:34:01.833 --> 02:34:05.036 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSITY BY FOUR PERCENT.

02:34:03.968 --> 02:34:06.637 region:rollup2
WHICH IS NOT BEING PROPOSED AS

02:34:05.036 --> 02:34:08.473 region:rollup2
YET.

02:34:06.637 --> 02:34:10.575 region:rollup2
WHEN THE STATE ONLY PAYS FORTY

02:34:08.473 --> 02:34:12.343 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT OF THE COST OF THE

02:34:10.575 --> 02:34:14.112 region:rollup2
CORE EDUCATION AYE COMES OUT TO

02:34:12.343 --> 02:34:16.080 region:rollup2
ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT.

02:34:14.112 --> 02:34:17.482 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE STATE BUDGET.

02:34:16.080 --> 02:34:18.916 region:rollup2
COMPARED OF TWO POINT FIVE

02:34:17.482 --> 02:34:21.152 region:rollup2
PERCENT INCREASED INFLATION.

02:34:18.916 --> 02:34:22.019 region:rollup2
NOW.

02:34:21.152 --> 02:34:23.855 region:rollup2
WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP UP

02:34:22.019 --> 02:34:25.123 region:rollup2
WITH INFLATION.

02:34:23.855 --> 02:34:26.991 region:rollup2
BUT GIVEN THE HISTORIC ONE THIRD

02:34:25.123 --> 02:34:27.792 region:rollup2
CUTS IN THE BUDGET OVER SINCE TO

02:34:26.991 --> 02:34:29.293 region:rollup2
THAT TOO NOW THE YEAR TWO

02:34:27.792 --> 02:34:31.662 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

02:34:29.293 --> 02:34:33.731 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T IF WE DON'T EVERY

02:34:31.662 --> 02:34:36.300 region:rollup2
YEAR KEEP UP WITH INFLATION.

02:34:33.731 --> 02:34:37.668 region:rollup2
AND TRY TO TO HAVE MORE

02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:39.003 region:rollup2
STUDENTS COMMITTED SYSTEM WHICH.

02:34:37.668 --> 02:34:40.705 region:rollup2
WE'RE GETTING A GREAT DEMAND

02:34:39.003 --> 02:34:41.339 region:rollup2
FROM STUDENTS WHO NOW QUALIFY

02:34:40.705 --> 02:34:43.207 region:rollup2
FOR A THROUGH G. COURSES AND SO

02:34:41.339 --> 02:34:44.442 region:rollup2
FORTH.

02:34:43.207 --> 02:34:45.276 region:rollup2
WE'RE WE'RE KINDA RIDING THEIR

02:34:44.442 --> 02:34:46.744 region:rollup2
THE WRONG MESSAGE FOR THE

02:34:45.276 --> 02:34:47.745 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY.

02:34:46.744 --> 02:34:49.013 region:rollup2
OVER THE LONG TERM WE'RE GONNA

02:34:47.745 --> 02:34:51.549 region:rollup2
HAVE TO FIND DIFFERENT DELIVERY

02:34:49.013 --> 02:34:52.183 region:rollup2
METHODS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION I

02:34:51.549 --> 02:34:53.317 region:rollup2
THINK THE GOVERNOR'S CORRECT ON

02:34:52.183 --> 02:34:54.552 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:34:53.317 --> 02:34:55.419 region:rollup2
IN THE MEDIUM TERM WE'RE HAVING

02:34:54.552 --> 02:34:57.755 region:rollup2
TROUBLE.

02:34:55.419 --> 02:34:59.657 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

02:34:57.755 --> 02:35:00.858 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS WHO TODAY WANT TO

02:34:59.657 --> 02:35:02.493 region:rollup2
GET IN ON A QUALIFY BUT THE

02:35:00.858 --> 02:35:04.395 region:rollup2
COURSES THEY TAKE TO BE

02:35:02.493 --> 02:35:05.563 region:rollup2
SOMEPLACE WITHIN.

02:35:04.395 --> 02:35:07.965 region:rollup2
CSU ARE YOU SEE.

02:35:05.563 --> 02:35:08.766 region:rollup2
SO.

02:35:07.965 --> 02:35:11.636 region:rollup2
I WISH.

02:35:08.766 --> 02:35:14.105 region:rollup2
IN A HOPEFULLY WE WE WE WE WE

02:35:11.636 --> 02:35:16.541 region:rollup2
DEFERRED THAT DECISION AND I WAS

02:35:14.105 --> 02:35:17.141 region:rollup2
A AT AT A REALLY OF. ON A SPLIT

02:35:16.541 --> 02:35:17.942 region:rollup2
FEELING AMONG THE BOARD ABOUT

RIVERSIDE AND MEETING WITH ME.

02:35:37.895 --> 02:35:41.899 region:rollup2
I FOUND THAT VERY HELPFUL AND I

02:35:39.664 --> 02:35:44.001 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY THAT IN MY FIVE YEARS

02:35:41.899 --> 02:35:45.803 region:rollup2
HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND

02:35:44.001 --> 02:35:48.339 region:rollup2
SEVERAL THOSE YEARS AS CHAIR

02:35:45.803 --> 02:35:50.408 region:rollup2
HYBRID OF EDUCATION. I HAVE NOT

02:35:48.339 --> 02:35:52.176 region:rollup2

BUT I I THINK IT'S SOMETHING

02:36:04.455 --> 02:36:08.659 region:rollup2
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT.

02:36:06.090 --> 02:36:10.862 region:rollup2
AND SOMETHING THAT WAS CALLED

02:36:08.659 --> 02:36:12.897 region:rollup2
INTO DOUBT. OF WITH.

02:36:10.862 --> 02:36:14.098 region:rollup2
DURING THE AUDIT BUT I THINK

YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB OF

02:36:14.098 --> 02:36:17.535 region:rollup2

THAT.

02:36:29.180 --> 02:36:31.849 region:rollup2
A.

02:36:30.948 --> 02:36:33.317 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CAN'T

02:36:31.849 --> 02:36:35.353 region:rollup2
DO.

02:36:33.317 --> 02:36:36.687 region:rollup2
WITHOUT OUR SUPPORT.

02:36:35.353 --> 02:36:37.521 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT

02:36:36.687 --> 02:36:39.824 region:rollup2
THAT MORE.

02:36:37.521 --> 02:36:42.360 region:rollup2
AS A LEGISLATIVE YEAR COMES

SO.

02:52:03.013 --> 02:52:07.484 region:rollup2

A MISCOMMUNICATION.

02:52:07.484 --> 02:52:11.922 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED FIVE PROVED

02:52:10.086 --> 02:52:14.558 region:rollup2
A PLAN.

.

02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:25.836 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN.

02:52:24.167 --> 02:52:27.070 region:rollup2
A DISCUSSION WITH THE

I AM NOT SURE THE DISTINCTION

02:52:37.347 --> 02:52:40.016 region:rollup2
BETWEEN APPROVING A PLAN THAT

02:52:38.915 --> 02:52:41.551 region:rollup2

IN THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:52:44.421 --> 02:52:50.260 region:rollup2

YES.

02:53:10.614 --> 02:53:14.584 region:rollup2
I'VE PROVED IN IN THIS WAS A

02:53:12.816 --> 02:53:16.319 region:rollup2
MISTAKE.

02:53:14.584 --> 02:53:17.754 region:rollup2
I APPROVED A PLAN.

02:53:16.319 --> 02:53:19.956 region:rollup2
BY WHICH.

02:53:17.754 --> 02:53:21.391 region:rollup2
THE CAMPUSES WOULD SUBMIT THEIR

02:53:19.956 --> 02:53:22.959 region:rollup2

PRESIDENT PRIOR TO SUBMITTING

02:53:22.959 --> 02:53:27.497 region:rollup2

02:53:24.661 --> 02:53:29.032 region:rollup2
WHEN I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS.

02:53:27.497 --> 02:53:30.600 region:rollup2
IN APPROVING THAT PLANNED WHAT

02:53:29.032 --> 02:53:32.135 region:rollup2
DID YOU ANTICIPATE WAS GOING TO

02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:33.436 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO THE SURVEYS WHEN THEY

02:53:32.135 --> 02:53:35.005 region:rollup2
CAME BACK TO THE OFFICE WHAT

02:53:33.436 --> 02:53:37.173 region:rollup2
AFFECT WHAT ACTION DID YOU THINK

02:53:35.005 --> 02:53:39.609 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TAKEN.

02:53:37.173 --> 02:53:41.378 region:rollup2
THE REVIEW WAS INTENDED TO MAKE

02:53:39.609 --> 02:53:42.946 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE ANSWERS WERE

02:53:41.378 --> 02:53:44.814 region:rollup2
ACCURATE.

02:53:42.946 --> 02:53:46.349 region:rollup2
WITHIN SCOPE. AND THAT THEY

02:53:44.814 --> 02:53:48.151 region:rollup2
REFLECTED THE VIEWS OF THE

02:53:46.349 --> 02:53:48.318 region:rollup2
CAMPUS LEADERSHIP.

02:53:48.151 --> 02:53:50.186 region:rollup2
AND.

02:53:48.318 --> 02:53:52.222 region:rollup2
.

02:53:50.186 --> 02:53:52.989 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAD HAD PREVIOUS

02:53:52.222 --> 02:53:54.758 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OF WITH.

02:53:52.989 --> 02:53:56.293 region:rollup2
.

02:53:54.758 --> 02:53:58.094 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS AUDIT WHERE INACCURATE

02:53:56.293 --> 02:54:00.697 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

02:53:58.094 --> 02:54:02.966 region:rollup2
ENDED UP HAVING A LONG TAIL AND

02:54:00.697 --> 02:54:05.302 region:rollup2
GOT INTO THE FINAL AUDIT REPORT.

02:54:02.966 --> 02:54:06.636 region:rollup2
WE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO CORRECT

02:54:05.302 --> 02:54:08.204 region:rollup2
IT IN THE BACK AND FORTH WITH

02:54:06.636 --> 02:54:09.506 region:rollup2
THE STATE AUDITOR.

02:54:08.204 --> 02:54:12.442 region:rollup2
AND SO.

02:54:09.506 --> 02:54:14.344 region:rollup2
THE FOCUS ON ACCURACY WAS WAS

02:54:12.442 --> 02:54:17.814 region:rollup2
KEY.

02:54:14.344 --> 02:54:20.116 region:rollup2
AND REALIZE THE SURVEYS HAD GONE

02:54:17.814 --> 02:54:20.917 region:rollup2
TO THE CAMPUS AUDITOR'S.

02:54:20.116 --> 02:54:23.586 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:54:20.917 --> 02:54:26.423 region:rollup2
THE CAMPUS AUDITORS WERE NOT

02:54:23.586 --> 02:54:28.224 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY THE PEOPLE IN THE

02:54:26.423 --> 02:54:30.727 region:rollup2
BEST POSITION TO ANSWER THE

02:54:28.224 --> 02:54:32.362 region:rollup2
SURVEYS.

02:54:30.727 --> 02:54:34.431 region:rollup2
AND THERE WAS.

02:54:32.362 --> 02:54:36.333 region:rollup2
I NOW KNOW A CONCLUSORY

02:54:34.431 --> 02:54:37.500 region:rollup2
QUESTION AT THE END ABOUT

02:54:36.333 --> 02:54:38.001 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO SAY

02:54:37.500 --> 02:54:39.669 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE OFFICE OF THE

02:54:38.001 --> 02:54:41.638 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT.

02:54:39.669 --> 02:54:44.240 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ALSO.

02:54:41.638 --> 02:54:46.142 region:rollup2
VALIDATED THE NEED FOR THE

02:54:44.240 --> 02:54:46.743 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR HIM OR HERSELF.

02:54:46.142 --> 02:54:47.510 region:rollup2

THE WAKE OF ALL OF THE. FOCUS

03:00:35.591 --> 03:00:38.695 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN ON.

03:00:36.659 --> 03:00:40.496 region:rollup2
THESE.

03:00:38.695 --> 03:00:42.231 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIS THIS RUN THIS IS

03:00:40.496 --> 03:00:43.733 region:rollup2

BY SOME FOLKS IN YOUR OFFICE.

03:00:43.733 --> 03:00:47.537 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ARE FEELING PRESSURE TO

MAKE A SERIES OF DRAMATIC

03:00:47.537 --> 03:00:51.774 region:rollup2

THE ON THE ON THE DECK. WHILE

03:00:55.845 --> 03:01:00.450 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARILY AND.

03:00:58.347 --> 03:01:01.250 region:rollup2
SITTING ON A MONEY.

03:01:00.450 --> 03:01:02.885 region:rollup2
I KNOW THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT UP

03:01:01.250 --> 03:01:04.520 region:rollup2
IN AN OUTRIGHT ELIMINATION OF

03:01:02.885 --> 03:01:06.189 region:rollup2
THE YOU SEE MEXICO INITIATIVE.

03:01:04.520 --> 03:01:08.091 region:rollup2

TO SPIN OUT A LOT OF THESE

03:01:08.091 --> 03:01:11.527 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS TO THE CAMPUS IS WHICH.

03:01:10.093 --> 03:01:12.995 region:rollup2

03:01:12.995 --> 03:01:15.798 region:rollup2
MONEY NECESSARILY JUST MEANS AT

03:01:13.963 --> 03:01:17.333 region:rollup2

THROUGH THE SIDE THIS I'VE FACT

03:22:37.879 --> 03:22:42.517 region:rollup2
FINDING. REVIEW.

03:22:39.848 --> 03:22:44.319 region:rollup2
THE. I I THINK IT'S IT'S BEEN

03:22:42.517 --> 03:22:44.886 region:rollup2
SAID THAT BUT THE BREAKDOWN IN

03:22:44.319 --> 03:22:45.954 region:rollup2
TRUST IS SOMETHING THAT THE

03:22:44.886 --> 03:22:49.257 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO

03:22:45.954 --> 03:22:49.457 region:rollup2
IT'S PRETTY SERIOUSLY AND.

03:22:49.257 --> 03:22:51.493 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:22:49.457 --> 03:22:53.228 region:rollup2
.

03:22:51.493 --> 03:22:54.829 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DOESN'T HELP THE FACT.

03:22:53.228 --> 03:22:56.264 region:rollup2
NOW GOING BACK A NUMBER OF YEARS

03:22:54.829 --> 03:22:58.967 region:rollup2
NOW WE'VE.

03:22:56.264 --> 03:23:01.002 region:rollup2

AUDITS MIND YOU SEE.

03:23:01.002 --> 03:23:05.273 region:rollup2
AND SO. THE MEDIA AT THE

03:23:03.972 --> 03:23:05.840 region:rollup2
BREAKDOWN IN TRUST I THINK

03:23:05.273 --> 03:23:07.909 region:rollup2
PROBABLY GOES BOTH WAYS AND

03:23:05.840 --> 03:23:11.046 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:23:07.909 --> 03:23:14.783 region:rollup2
.

CAN SEE AN AUDIT REQUEST AND AND

03:23:16.818 --> 03:23:20.655 region:rollup2
WONDER. HOW THIS AUDIT GRENADE

03:23:19.220 --> 03:23:22.657 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO BE LOBBED OVER AND

03:23:20.655 --> 03:23:25.326 region:rollup2
AFFECT YOU IN THE INSTITUTION?

03:23:22.657 --> 03:23:27.328 region:rollup2
WHEN I LOOK AT THIS AUDIT.

03:23:25.326 --> 03:23:27.695 region:rollup2
AFTER IT WAS DIED THE THE

03:23:27.328 --> 03:23:30.331 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL AUDIT.

03:23:27.695 --> 03:23:31.766 region:rollup2
.

03:23:30.331 --> 03:23:33.268 region:rollup2
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE OCALAN AT

03:23:31.766 --> 03:23:34.502 region:rollup2
WHICH WHICH ONE WAS THAT BUT THE

03:23:33.268 --> 03:23:36.004 region:rollup2
AUDIT THAT WAS ON YOU CO P..

03:23:34.502 --> 03:23:37.639 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:23:36.004 --> 03:23:38.973 region:rollup2
THE FINDINGS ARE NOT FINDINGS

03:23:37.639 --> 03:23:40.275 region:rollup2
THAT ALARMED ME.

03:23:38.973 --> 03:23:41.876 region:rollup2
AS A LAWMAKER.

03:23:40.275 --> 03:23:44.345 region:rollup2
I.

03:23:41.876 --> 03:23:46.281 region:rollup2
FOUND THEM INSIGHTFUL

03:23:44.345 --> 03:23:47.782 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTIVE THEY TALKED A LITTLE

03:23:46.281 --> 03:23:49.317 region:rollup2
BIT ABOUT HOW TO BE BETTER

03:23:47.782 --> 03:23:50.952 region:rollup2
BUDGET MEAN. BETTER BUDGETING

03:23:49.317 --> 03:23:52.353 region:rollup2
PROCESSES.

03:23:50.952 --> 03:23:53.955 region:rollup2
AT E. COMPARED A LITTLE BIT

03:23:52.353 --> 03:23:55.957 region:rollup2
APPLES TO ORANGES WITH SOME OF

03:23:53.955 --> 03:23:57.759 region:rollup2
THAT EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATIONS

03:23:55.957 --> 03:24:01.396 region:rollup2
ACROSS DIFFERENT PARA EDUCATION

03:23:57.759 --> 03:24:03.198 region:rollup2
SEGMENT SO. IF YOU COULD PUT

03:24:01.396 --> 03:24:04.599 region:rollup2
COME LOOK AT IT IN AND AND

03:24:03.198 --> 03:24:05.633 region:rollup2
ANALYZED IT YOU WOULD SEE.

03:24:04.599 --> 03:24:08.069 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE.

03:24:05.633 --> 03:24:10.071 region:rollup2
.

03:24:08.069 --> 03:24:11.506 region:rollup2
COMPARABLE UP POSITIONS ARE NOT.

03:24:10.071 --> 03:24:13.108 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN JUST TAKE THE

03:24:11.506 --> 03:24:15.610 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND SAY WELL THE CSU

03:24:13.108 --> 03:24:17.112 region:rollup2
CFO IN THE U. CCF ARE EXACT SAME

03:24:15.610 --> 03:24:18.947 region:rollup2
SPOT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME JOB.

03:24:17.112 --> 03:24:20.014 region:rollup2
SO WHY WOULD THEY BE PAID THE

03:24:18.947 --> 03:24:22.417 region:rollup2
SAME AMOUNT.

03:24:20.014 --> 03:24:24.185 region:rollup2
SO AS AS LAWMAKERS.

03:24:22.417 --> 03:24:25.687 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW IT'S OUR JOB TO

03:24:24.185 --> 03:24:27.722 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THESE AUDITS AND THEN.

03:24:25.687 --> 03:24:28.289 region:rollup2
ANALYZE IT FOR OURSELVES AND

03:24:27.722 --> 03:24:30.258 region:rollup2
COME OUT WITH SOMETHING SO.

03:24:28.289 --> 03:24:32.327 region:rollup2
.

03:24:30.258 --> 03:24:33.528 region:rollup2
AND SO I ALSO LOOK AT.

03:24:32.327 --> 03:24:35.263 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE DISCRETIONARY

03:24:33.528 --> 03:24:36.531 region:rollup2
PRIVATELY RAISED MONEY IN AND

03:24:35.263 --> 03:24:38.633 region:rollup2
HOW THAT WAS SPENT AND THOUGHT

03:24:36.531 --> 03:24:40.335 region:rollup2
WELL THAT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE.

03:24:38.633 --> 03:24:41.436 region:rollup2
WHAT LAWMAKERS DO? WE PRIVATELY

03:24:40.335 --> 03:24:42.704 region:rollup2
RAISE MONEY AND IF THERE'S A

03:24:41.436 --> 03:24:44.439 region:rollup2
DINNER THAT'S PAID FOR BY THE

03:24:42.704 --> 03:24:45.807 region:rollup2
PRIVATELY RAISE MONEY THAT'S NOT

03:24:44.439 --> 03:24:47.442 region:rollup2
SUCH A BIG PROBLEM BUT.

03:24:45.807 --> 03:24:49.444 region:rollup2
FOR YOU SEE PERHAPS THERE'S A

03:24:47.442 --> 03:24:50.478 region:rollup2
BETTER BUDGETING SYSTEM ON THAT

03:24:49.444 --> 03:24:51.813 region:rollup2
CAN BE WORKED OUT SO NONE OF

03:24:50.478 --> 03:24:53.214 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS RAISE ALARM BELLS

03:24:51.813 --> 03:24:54.649 region:rollup2
FOR ME AND. IT WAS THE HUMAN

03:24:53.214 --> 03:24:58.086 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR ELEMENT

03:24:54.649 --> 03:25:00.054 region:rollup2
THAT JUST CAME IN AND OUR

03:24:58.086 --> 03:25:01.523 region:rollup2
CURRENT TOUR THROUGH. THIS

03:25:00.054 --> 03:25:02.991 region:rollup2
BUILDING AND THAT WERE STILL

03:25:01.523 --> 03:25:03.291 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING WITH.

03:25:02.991 --> 03:25:05.693 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

03:25:03.291 --> 03:25:07.862 region:rollup2
.

03:25:05.693 --> 03:25:09.864 region:rollup2

CIRCUMSPECT ABOUT IT AT THIS

03:25:11.699 --> 03:25:15.570 region:rollup2
MOMENT.

03:25:12.667 --> 03:25:17.505 region:rollup2
SO.

03:25:15.570 --> 03:25:19.774 region:rollup2
MORE ENGAGEMENT BY YOU SEE IS

03:25:17.505 --> 03:25:22.143 region:rollup2
PROBABLY GOOD DONE.

03:25:19.774 --> 03:25:23.678 region:rollup2
BY.

03:25:22.143 --> 03:25:24.846 region:rollup2
AGAIN A FACT FINDING REVIEW WAS

03:25:23.678 --> 03:25:26.447 region:rollup2
A VERY POSITIVE THING.

03:25:24.846 --> 03:25:29.184 region:rollup2
.

03:25:26.447 --> 03:25:30.051 region:rollup2
THAT WAS TAKEN ASIDE TAKING ON

03:25:29.184 --> 03:25:32.387 region:rollup2
THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE

03:25:30.051 --> 03:25:33.855 region:rollup2

BUT MAYBE WE CAN DO THIS IN A

03:25:43.798 --> 03:25:48.403 region:rollup2
MORE CONSTRUCTIVE MANNER.

03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:49.837 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO DOESN'T HIDE IT YOU

03:25:48.403 --> 03:25:51.506 region:rollup2
KNOW IN A MANNER THAT DOES NOT.

03:25:49.837 --> 03:25:53.575 region:rollup2
SEIZE UPON

03:25:51.506 --> 03:25:55.076 region:rollup2
FINDINGS WITHOUT OUR OWN

03:25:53.575 --> 03:25:56.878 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS OF THOSE FINDINGS TO

03:25:55.076 --> 03:25:58.413 region:rollup2
DETERMINE.

03:25:56.878 --> 03:25:59.714 region:rollup2
WHETHER NOT WE SHOULD BE

03:25:58.413 --> 03:26:01.783 region:rollup2
OUTRAGED OR THERE'S A MORE

03:25:59.714 --> 03:26:03.718 region:rollup2

THAT SHINES AS BRIGHTLY TODAY AS

03:26:08.690 --> 03:26:10.925 region:rollup2

THE CAMPUSES ALL THE TIME.

03:33:04.538 --> 03:33:09.577 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT A REFLECTION OF A

03:33:07.808 --> 03:33:12.046 region:rollup2
LACK OF TRUST IN THE CHANCELLOR

03:33:09.577 --> 03:33:15.516 region:rollup2
IS JUST AS YOU MENTION THESE

03:33:12.046 --> 03:33:17.018 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES ARE BIG PLACES AND SO.

03:33:15.516 --> 03:33:19.287 region:rollup2
IT BECOMES KIND OF A BELT AND

03:33:17.018 --> 03:33:22.423 region:rollup2
SUSPENDERS APPROACH.

03:33:19.287 --> 03:33:24.592 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY.

03:33:22.423 --> 03:33:26.961 region:rollup2
GETS THE INFORMATION AND HAS HAD

03:33:24.592 --> 03:33:28.329 region:rollup2
A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT.

SO.

03:33:28.329 --> 03:33:31.165 region:rollup2
AND AND AGAIN.

03:33:29.397 --> 03:33:35.336 region:rollup2
.

03:33:31.165 --> 03:33:36.237 region:rollup2
WE WOULD NOT DO IT THE SAME WAY

03:33:35.336 --> 03:33:38.205 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

03:33:36.237 --> 03:33:40.708 region:rollup2
AND HAVE.

HAPPEN.

03:33:42.009 --> 03:33:44.779 region:rollup2
BUT.

03:33:43.778 --> 03:33:49.183 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WAS PART OF THE

03:33:44.779 --> 03:33:50.918 region:rollup2
GENESIS.

03:33:49.183 --> 03:33:52.820 region:rollup2

03:33:59.660 --> 03:34:04.031 region:rollup2
QUESTION EARLIER COMMENT EARLIER

PROBLEM THERE.

03:34:24.652 --> 03:34:27.988 region:rollup2
TO WHERE THEY CAN'T TRUST THE

03:34:26.087 --> 03:34:29.757 region:rollup2
AUDITOR'S TO WORK WITH THEM.
