IS HERE SHE'S THE FIRST SOUTH ASIAN WOMAN ON THE BENCH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR BROWN PRIOR TO JOINING THE BENCH TO SERVED AS A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR IN UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. DURING THAT TIME SHE PROSECUTED CYBER CRIME FRAUD ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMES CHILD SEX TOURISM AND CRIMES INVOLVING THE DANGER SPECIES AND I UNDERSTAND THAT ALSO THE YOUR HONOR THAT YOU WERE ALSO INVOLVED WORKED WITH SUPREME COURT JUSTICE GOOD INCLUDE ONE STUDY OF LOOKING AT BASICALLY THE REDUCTION OF API. ATTORNEYS TO TED SHIPS AND. AND THAT PROGRESS SO WELCOME AND WE LOOK FOR TO YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING THANK YOU. I THINK I'M I'M ON RIGHT YES OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR PAN FOR HAVING ME HERE I WANT TO START BY TELLING YOU SORT OF WHY I'M SO THRILLED. TO BE ADDRESSING THIS ROOM A FABULOUS PEOPLE FIRST OF ALL LIKE MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM I'M GREAT TO THE UNITED STATES MY PARENTS EMIGRATED FROM INDIA IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. AND WENT STARTED GRADE SCHOOL HERE I DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. AT AND GROWING UP I DIDN'T KNOW A SINGLE LAWYER SO TO BE SITTING HERE AT SAVE FEDERAL PROCESS CUTER AND NOW A STATE COURT JUDGE. IT'S AN INCREDIBLE THRILL. A G. M. TO BE RIGHT AND I HAVE THANK YOU SENATOR PAN FOR HIGHLIGHTING A GREAT. SOME OF BLACKS FOR EIGHT AMERICANS SO THE SHIN. FOR ME TODAY IS HOW ARE WE GOING IN. I WANT TO START BY SAYING WE HAVE A LOT TO CELEBRATE ALL RIGHT ARE CHIEF JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME COURT. IS DONE YOU CAN DO THE SECOND WAY. WE JUST RECENTLY GOT A NEW CHAIR FOR THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE WHICH IS THE WATCH STRONG GROUP THAT WATCHES THE PERFORMANCE OF ALL THE STATE COURT JUDGES AND THAT CHAIR IS NANCY. NISHIMURA SO WE CERTAINLY HAVE POINTS OF LIGHT TO CELEBRATE. IF USE TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT ASIAN AMERICANS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WE MAKE UP ONLY 2% OF ALL STATE COURT JUDGES AND STATE COURT JUDGES ARE. THE IMPORTANT WHICH BUT 90% OF THE LEGAL WORK IN AMERICA. WE DO A LOT OF HEAVY LIFTING ONLY 2% OF ALL STATE COURT JUDGES. WE'RE ONLY 3% OF ALL FEDERAL JUDGES BUT IT ALICE YEAH ACTUALLY DOING BETTER AND PART OF. AND WE'RE DOING BETTER IS BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS. OKAY IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN HAS APPOINTED A SEVENTY SEVEN ZERO SEVENTY ASIAN AMERICAN JUDGES AND THE LAST SEVEN YEARS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF EFFORTS LIKE THIS GETTING THE WORD OUT GETTING PEOPLE TO APPLY GETTING US MOVING FORWARD NO ASIAN AMERICANS OR 16% THE POPULATION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE NOW 7% OF THE STATE COURT JUDICIARY A HUGE STEP FORWARD AND I JUST WANT TO SAY I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE OF THIS WITH THE NEW GOVERNOR WITH GOVERNOR. SOME A GOOD TRACK. WERE BROWN. EXCELLENT APPOINTMENTS LIKE ME. I HAVE TO SAY IT'S BEEN AN EXCITING TIME FOR US BUT AS SENATOR PAN SAID THERE IS A STUDY THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER BY JUSTUS GOODWIN LIU WITH HELP FROM THE PABA AND THE YALE LAW SCHOOL AND THAT STUDY GIVES US A NUMBER OF A NUMBER OF NUMBERS ACTUALLY ABOUT THE STATE OF ASIAN AMERICANS AND THE LAW AND IT REALLY COMES TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WE STILL HAVE A LONG LONG WAY TO GO. SO IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THE NUMBER OF ASIAN AMERICANS GOING TO LAW SCHOOL INSTEAD OF MEDICAL SCHOOL HAS INCREASED IT HAS ACTUALLY QUADRUPLED SO WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF ASIAN AMERICANS BEING INTO THE FASHION. BUT THAT SOME IS NOT. EITHER IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR OR IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE ARENA. SO IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS LARGE LAW FIRMS BIG TOP TEN LAW FIRMS THERE CERTAINLY HIRING A MAID AT ASIAN AMERICAN LAWYERS FACT. IF YOU LOOK AT A LAW FIRM AND YOU COUNT UP ALL THE ASIAN AND ALL THE ALL THE MINORITY ASSOCIATES AND PARTNERS. ASIAN AMERICANS ACTUALLY REPRESENT THE LARGEST MINORITY GROUP IN PRIVATE LAW FIRMS. BUT THEY'RE ALSO THE ASSOCIATES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST ATTRITION RATES AND THE LOWEST RATIO OF PARTNERS TO ASSOCIATES. SO TRANSLATION THEY'RE LEAVING IN DROVES AND THEY'RE NOT MOVING UP. AND WE SEE THAT SAME TREND ECHOED IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SERVICE SO ONE OF THE M. IN. THAT CAME OUT OF THIS STUDY WAS THAT MOST ASIAN AMERICANS DON'T GO INTO THE LEGAL PROFESSION THINKING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO INTO GOVERNMENT OR THINKING IF THEY'RE GOING TO GO INTO PUBLIC SERVICE. AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE CHICKEN AND EGG ISSUES RIGHT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T SEE PEOPLE IN THOSE POSITIONS YOU CAN'T IMAGINE YOURSELF BEING THERE BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO DREAM IT FIRST RIGHT. SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT NATIONAL NUMBERS SO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S IMPORTANT PEOPLE YOUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR YOUR COUNTY IS NUMBER ONE LONG FORCE LAWYER YOUR ACCOUNT. IT IS THINGS LIKE. WE'RE GOING TO GO AFTER. OR GOING TO GO AFTER DRUGS AND GANGS RIGHT THEY MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO BE HIRED WHERE WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR RESOURCES WHAT WE'RE GOING TO EMPHASIZE. SO THIS STUDY FOUND THAT OUT OF THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN. ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IN THE NATION. HOW MANY WERE ASIAN AMERICAN. FOUR FOUR OKAY ONLY FOR AND THIS HAPPENS AGAIN ON THE FEDERAL SIDE SO WE HAVE FOUR FEDERAL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE NINETY FOUR IN THE NATION OKAY SO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OUT OF NINETY FOUR POTENTIAL TOP FEDERAL PROSECUTORS IN THE COUNTRY A GRAND TOTAL OF THREE WERE ASIAN AMERICAN. ONE FOR ONE. ONE FOR HAWAII AND- THERE ARE A- JOSH SOMEBODY YOU MIGHT KNOW FROM THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK THAT WAS IT FOR THE ENTIRE NATION OKAY. THEN WE SEE THIS AGAIN IN ACADEMIA AS SENATOR PAN SAID YOU KNOW APPARENTLY WERE OVER REPRESENTED. BUT NOT REALLY I ROSE LAW SCHOOL DEANS THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND TWO IN THE COUNTRY AND IN TWENTY THIRTEEN ONLY THREE WERE ASIAN AMERICAN SO CERTAINLY THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE HERE AND I WILL PULL IT BACK TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE- LARGEST ASIAN AMERICAN PIE RELATION OF ANY STATE. WE ARE CALIFORNIA. IN. THE COUNTY BATES NUMBER. 38% RATE IN MY OWN COUNTY WE'RE 14% THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO 36% WE'RE BIG NUMBERS RIGHT AND DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW MANY COUNTIES WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. FIFTY EIGHT CIVICS OKAY WE'RE WORKING ON THAT TOO ALL RIGHT PEOPLE WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OKAY IN CALIFORNIA THE STATE WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF ASIAN AMERICANS HOW MANY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE ASIAN AMERICAN IN CALIFORNIA. OKAY. ONE AGAIN THIS IS A CHICKEN AND EGG SITUATION RIGHT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T EVER SEE PEOPLE IN THESE POSITIONS MAYBE YOU CAN IMAGINE YOURSELF SITTING IN THAT CHAIR RIGHT. BEFORE I KNOW YOUR BRAIN WITH FACTS AND FIGURES AND PERCENTAGES LET ME TAKE A STEP BACK AND ASK THE QUESTION WHY WHY DOES IT MATTER OKAY WHY DOES IT MATTER. THAT WE HAVE DIVERSITY ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES REPRESENTED IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION. WELL FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE LAW AFFECTS ABSOLUTELY EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS. WHETHER YOU'RE GETTING A DIVORCE OR FILING BANKRUPTCY HAVE A CONTRACT DISPUTE YOU HAVE A TENANT YOU WANNA VICT WE'RE GOD FOR BID YOUR DAUGHTERS JUST BEEN PICKED UP ON RECKLESS DRIVING AND CHARGED. WITH A MISDEMEANOR GUESS WHERE YOU'RE GOING. OR YOU'RE WALKING INTO A COURTHOUSE. WHAT DO YOU WANT IN THAT COURTHOUSE YOU WANT A FAIR SHAKE. YOU WANT TO BE HEARD RIGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SO LET'S SAY YOU WALK INTO A COURTHOUSE IN YOU SEE THAT GREAT BIG DIRECTORY WITH ALL THE NAMES OF THE JUDGES THAT SIT IN THAT COURTHOUSE. AND YOU SEE AMES LIKE. AS AND WEST SHOE AND DOROTHY CAM. MAYBE YOU WALK AWAY AND YOU LOOK AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF OKAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ETHNICITY OF MY JUDGES GONNA BE BUT I SEE THAT THESE POOL OF DECISION MAKERS. ARE DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE AND MAYBE YOU FEEL OKAY I'M GOING TO BE HEARD. AND THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT STUDIES LIKE THE GAVEL GAP WHICH IS ANOTHER TERRIFIC STUDY I ONLY GET FIFTEEN MINUTES WILL TELL US IT TELLS US THAT THE GAVEL MATTERS FOR HOW CONFIDENT. ARE ABOUT SHARE. IF YOU PULL IN STUDY AFTER STUDY MOST OF WHAT AMERICA THEY COME TO THE CONCLUSION. ABOUT 70% OF FOLKS CAUCASIAN FOLKS WILL SAY WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN OUR JUDICIARY WITH THAT NUMBER DROPS TO ONLY 50% WHEN AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE PULLED. SO THIS GAVEL GAP IS IMPORTANT AND INCLUSION IS IMPORTANT SOMEBODY TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY ABOUT HOW THIS PLAYS OUT IN ONE PARTICULAR CASE SO A COUPLE YEARS BACK THERE WAS A CASE AND DEPENDENCY COURT. DEPENDENCY COURT IS WHERE YOU GO WHEN YOUR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN AWAY. BECAUSE OF EITHER EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL ABUSE. TRIAL COURT JUDGE HEARD MILLIONS OF THE FACT THAT THE MOTHER IN THIS CASE WOULD DISCIPLINE HER CHILDREN A WITH THE CHAPEL OKAY IT'S A- SANDEL SO SHE WOULD TAKE OFF FOR FLIP FLOP AND SHE WOULD. WACKER KID ON THE BETH OR TAPPER KID ON THE **** NOW FOR MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM THAT'S NOT A COMPLETELY UNUSUAL FORM OF CHILD DISCIPLINE YOU MAY HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH THE CHAPEL IN YOUR YOUTH. BUT THIS PARTICULAR TRIAL J. MADE RULING THAT IT WAS PURSUING A CATEGORICAL SIRIUS PHYSICAL HARM. TO HIT A CHILD WITH A CHAPEL. AND IT WAS A CONCLUSION THAT THAT'S A IT'S A PER SE RULE SO THIS CASE WENT UP TO THE COURT OF APPEAL AND IT ENDED UP BEING COMING BEFORE A FRIEND OF MINE BRIAN HAAS THAT NO BRIGHT HOUSE SAID IS THIS TALL BLONDE GUY. STAT JUSTICE BRAND HOUSE THAT. UCLA LAW SCHOOL I WENT TO UCLA LAW SCHOOL WHEN I WENT TO UCLA LAW SCHOOL 49% OF MY INCOMING CLASS WAS NON WHITE. AND 51% OF MY CLASS WERE WOMEN. THAT'S THE ENVIRONMENT THAT BRIAN GOT HIS LEGAL EDUCATION IN. THEN HE WENT TO WORK FOR THE US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND WHEN HE WAS THERE. IN THE HISTORY OF THE US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE HAD AN ASIAN AMERICAN HEAD OF THE OFFICE. YANKEES AND- BRIAN WORKED WITH ALL OF US HE WORKED WITH PETER HERNANDEZ ANYWAY SHOE AND DOROTHY CAN'T M. AND BE. THAT INFORMED HIS UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO BRING CALIFORNIA RAISED. AND AS IT TURNS OUT BRIAN REVERSE THE TRIAL COURT JUDGE. SO I AM NOT SAYING THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE ANY PARTICULAR ETHNICITY ON THE BENCH I'M NOT SAYING YOU NEED TO HAVE ANY PART PARTICULAR ETHNICITY AS YOUR LAWYER WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT WE NEED TO BE INCLUSIVE BECAUSE WE ALL BENEFIT FROM SHARING OUR- EXPERIENCES FROM GOING TO LUNCH WITH ONE ANOTHER FROM TALKING ABOUT OUR CASES. AND THAT MOM BUYS HOW WE C. CALIFORNIA AND HOW WE DECISIONS HERE. SO AS I WRAP UP GET TO ANSWER ONE MORE QUESTION WHICH IS WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE ANTONY'S PACK BEING A GENIUS WAS THE FIRST QUESTION SHE SAID TO ME SHE SAID WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE. AND I SAID WHAT A GREAT QUESTION SO FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO PUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT THAT SENATOR PAN IS GOING TO UNDERSTAND SO I LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE. THIS AS THAT DIAGNOSE. RIGHT FOR YOU. WHAT DISEASE SOMEBODY HAS OR WHAT. TUMOR YOU GO GET AN MRI I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK YOU DO WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. AND THAT'S WHY THESE KIND OF STUDIES ARE SO IMPORTANT SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A TASK FORCE. THAT DOES WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY AND KEEPS MOVING FORWARD AND GETTING US THE NUMBER. AND THE NEW WANTS TO ANALYSIS THAT HELPS US UNDERSTAND. HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD. I MEAN IT'S VERY BOTTOM LINE IS. RIGHT WE MAKE A CHANGE. IN THE BALLOT BOX VOTED FOR CHANGE. WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER REALLY POWERFUL MECHANISM FOR CHANGE THAT'S A NICE TO EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM WERE ALL CONSUMERS. YOU BYE. LEGAL PRODUCTS. SOMEONE TELL YOU ABOUT MY BROTHER. COOMARASWAMY HE'S- A LITTLE START UP ON HIS THIRD. START UP THEY'RE NOT SO LITTLE ANYMORE. WHEN HE SAW SEPT ARTE SAID. HE HAD TO HAVE A LEGAL TEAM TO MANAGE THE M. EIGHTEEN. AND HE WENT TO ONE OF THE TOP LAW FIRMS AND HE SAID I'M A DIVERSE COMPANY I REPRESENT. A DIVERSE CLIENTS. WE'RE WE'RE TWO ASIANS AND A NICE SCOTTISH AMERICAN GUY AND WE WANT A DIVERSE LEGAL TEAM. AND THAT NUMBER ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE LAW FIRM GAVE HIM A SENIOR PARTNER WHO'S HISPANIC. A SENIOR PARTNER WHO'S A WOMAN AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN ASSOCIATE. SO BASICALLY HE DEMANDED DIVERSITY SO. THAT'S THE OTHER FOR CHANGE WE CAN IMPLEMENT I THINK SO MUCH FOR ME AND I'LL BE AROUND FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I SHOULD MENTION THAT I HAVE A BROTHER WHO IS ACTUALLY IN THE TOURNEY. ACTUALLY HE WAS ASSOCIATED. DECIDED THAT DE DID MOVE ON THE PARTNER DECIDE TO PURSUE OTHER PATHS SO I GET THE STORY TO SHARE. SO QUESTIONS FROM WELL FROM THE CAUCUS MEMBERS SUMMER CAR. THANK THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PAN AND THANK YOU A JUDGE TO SWAMI I AGREE WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT I THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT EXCELLENT CHOICE. AND YOU KNOW I AM HAVING. BEING IN THE SAME PROFESSION AND HE WAS ON THE BAR ASSOCIATION MY COUNTY. TWO DECADES AGO TALK ABOUT THE SAME ISSUES AND WHETHER WAS LAW FIRM LOANS LAW FIRMS FOR AS YOU INDICATED IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND EVERY C. THIS IN TEXAS ON SO MANY DIFFERENT ARENAS WHERE AND THE SENATOR JUST PURCHASED. WHERE WE DON'T GET IT BACK. WE JUST AND. JOHN SHOP BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY WHAT WHETHER YOU'RE PREGNANT TRYING TO ADVANCE WITHIN. A DA OR PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE COUNTY COUNCIL WHAT HAVE YOU. TRYING TO GET IT A JUDGE APPOINTMENT OR TRYING TO ADVANCE YOUR LAW FIRM WHERE YOUR CORPORATE SETTING. AND SO YOU KNOW. WHAT I GUESS IS KIND OF THE REPETITION OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. TIME AND AGAIN AND I AND I ACTUALLY LOVE THE EXAMPLE YOU AND IT BETH. BECAUSE THE FIRMS JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE THEY'RE GOING TO. THEY'RE GONNA DICTATE THINGS BY THEIR POCKETBOOK AND SO. CLIENTS ARE DEMANDING SOMETHING THEY'LL MOVE WHEN I GUESS SO HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE REACH OUT BEYOND THE SO CALLED API COMMUNITY THAT'S REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS TWO PEOPLE THAT ARE POSITIONS YOUR BROTHER OR A POSITION LIKE YOU KNOW WHO LIVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HOW DO WE GET BEYOND OUTSIDE OF THOSE THAT ARE. HERE TODAY BECAUSE THEY KNOW ABOUT THE ISSUES OF LEARN MORE ABOUT IT WHAT IS YOUR SUGGESTION FOR THAT AND IT THE TIME HE'D BEEN DOING THIS WORK WELL I ACTUALLY DO THE BAR ASSOCIATIONS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. HAD YOU KNOW WE HAVE ETHNIC BARS YET THE SOUTH ASIAN BAR WE HAVE A POP UP WE HAVE. NO PABLO WHICH HELP PUT THIS STUDY TOGETHER THEY'RE ALL VERY IMPORTANT. BUT I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO SEE YOU KNOW THE ABA. TO START LOOKING AND HAVING SOME COMMITTEES ON MENTORING AND MENTORSHIP AND ONE UNDERLYING ISSUES FOR ASIAN AMERICAN LAWYER IS FOR MANY OF US WITH THE FIRST LAWYERS IN OUR FAMILIES. AND THAT'S TRUE FOR HIS I THINK AMERICANS IT'S- YOU KNOW TRUE ACROSS THE BOARD. SO A LOT OF THIS IS LIKE JUST BASIC MENTORING RIGHT YOU KNOW TELLING PEOPLE HATE TAKE A YOU KNOW. I CAME OUT A LAW SCHOOL AND WENT TO A VERY LARGE LAW FIRM AND MADE WITH MAKING AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY LIKE. YOU KNOW MORE THAN I HAD EVER IMAGINED I TOOK A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PAY CUT. TO GO CLERK FOR A JUDGE RIGHT MY MOTHER OH MY GOSH SHE'S LIKE YOU'RE THIS STUPID AS OF MY THREE CHILDREN YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW I AM. WITH YOU RIGHT. BUT THIS IS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY TELL YOU. YOU KNOW ZIG TODAY RIGHT AND WE NEED MAINSTREAM BAR ASSOCIATIONS. TO TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO MOVE THIS. YEAH. WHEN I WENT THIS ONE FROM PUBLIC DEFENDERS CANCEL A TWO HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND. AND THE LIKE I WAS OUT OF THE BOX YOU FROM ABOUT GOING TO LAW SCHOOL TO BEGIN WITH SO. I THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR VALIDATING MY. M. PRESHOW HE'S WELL LET'S SAY A FIRST WHEN THE PEDIATRICS IS LESS PAYING OF ALL THE MEDICAL SPECIALTIES AND THEN I WENT TO POLITICS. STILL THE SAME WAY. AS A MEMBER. IT'S GOING TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THE JUDGE FOR NUMBER ONE WHICH COMING HERE TO CHERYL WITH AS HER EXPERIENCES AND ALSO WANT TO THANK HER FOR US SELECTING PUBLIC SERVICE. FOR SO MANY YEARS AND DODD NOT ONLY THAT BUT I THINK YOU'RE HELPING TO KIND OF CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE AND CHANGING THE STEREO TYPE OF ASIAN AMERICAN THAT BY BEING A JUDGE IN IN THE COURT ROOM. AND UP YOU KNOW. I WANT TO SHARE IT OUT YOU KNOW I A COUPLE OF INCIDENT IN THE PAST I PRACTICED LAW FOR ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEARS BEFORE. BEING ELECTED TO THIS ASSEMBLY. AND WHAT THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN A WHAT INTO A COURT ROOM IS AT. I MISSED. THE OUT. THE CLERK IN HIS EYES ARE I ARE YOU YOU'RE HERE EARLY AND MISTER INTERPRETER. YOU KNOW SO THAT'S A VERY COMMON PHENOMENON THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME BUT YOU KNOW I WE NEED CHANGED. PERCEPTION THAT AND SKATE DODD MOVEMENTS SO. ONE OF THANK YOU FOR BEING THAT. DOING HELPING GIVE. HIS. SO I GUESS I. ONE MORE BRIEF QUESTION SO YOU TALK ABOUT AND THIS IS SOMETHING OUT OF JOEL CROSSCUT. FROM PANELS BUT SO IF SOMEONE SAYS OKAY I'M GOING TO GO AND BE A LAWYER FOR WHATEVER REASON NOW I AND THERE THE FIRST IN THE FAMILY AND THEN. NOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HOW DO YOU TAKE AGAIN AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF A. P. R. ATTORNEYS IN TERMS OF PROPORTION BUT THEN NOW WE WANTED TO GO PURSUE THAT'S A JUDGESHIP. HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE TO SEE THEMSELVES IN THAT ROLE IN ADDITION TO CERTAINLY YOU KNOW YOU SEND EXAMPLE BEING A JUDGE AND SO FORTH TO DO TO HELP GET. THAT VISION AND PEOPLE MIGHT SEEM SELVES PARTNER JUDGE IN THOSE LEADERSHIP ROLES AND WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MAIN BARRIER TO GETTING PEOPLE THEY'RE NOT JUST PEOPLE SEEING THEM THOSE THEY'RE PLANNING FOR THAT SO. WELL I THINK THE VISION IS ONE OF THE BEARS I THINK IT THEY THE PROBLEM WITH ASIAN AMERICANS NOT BEING INTO LEGAL PROFESSION PUBLIC SERVICE MINE. IS PRETTY IT WOULD LEAD TO MENTAL THE LEAD. IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND WE'RE MORE POROUS THAN AREAS WE MOVED BETWEEN PRIVATE PRACTICE AND PUBLIC SERVICE QUITE A BIT. AND SO DEAD YANG WHO WAS THE ONLY ASIAN AMERICAN TO LEAD THE US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN LOS ANGELES. IS A PARTNER AT GIBSON DUNN AND CRUTCHER AND IF I. BASED ON WHAT SHE'S DRIVING SHE SEEMS. VERY WELL BUT YOU KNOW ASIAN AMERICAN FAMILIES DON'T ALWAYS SEE THAT THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A BETH THERE'S A WONDERFUL BENEFIT TO PRIVATE PUBLIC SERVICE I WILL BE IN PUBLIC SERVICE ALL MY LIFE BECAUSE I LOVE THIS. BUT THERE'S THERE CAN ALSO BE A MONETARY BENEFIT TO THAT SO ANOTHER AREA WERE ASIAN AMERICANS ARE TERRIBLY UNDERREPRESENTED ISN'T CLERKSHIPS SO NATION WIDE ONLY FILLED WITH ASIAN AMERICAN. THE SIX PER CENT OF FEDERAL CLERKSHIPS LET ME PUT THIS IN CONTEXT AGAIN. ASIAN AMERICANS NOT ONLY GO TO LAW SCHOOL BUT- WELL. OKAY THE TOP 10% OUT OF THE TOP THIRTY LAW SCHOOL IN M. RECCA ASIAN AMERICAN. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS THEY'RE DOING GREAT THEY'RE ON LAW REVIEW THE ORDER OF THE COIF THERE AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME OKAY BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING INTO THAT NEXT INCREDIBLY. AGES. BOB OF SHIPS. LOOK AT THE JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COURT NOTICE MOST OF THEM CLERKED RIGHT MOST OF THE FEDERAL JUDGE'S CLERK RIGHT I TOOK THAT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PAGE PAY CUT TO BE A FEDERAL CLERK AND THEN TO BE AN APPELLATE CLICK RIGHT AND MY MOTHER CRIED AGAIN BECAUSE IT WAS ANOTHER OF MAKING NO MONEY RIGHT. BUT THAT END OF THERE'S COULD IN AND THERE'S A PULL AND THE PUSH RIGHT ASIAN AMERICANS HAVE TO PUT THEMSELVES OUT THERE BUT WE ALSO NEED THE ASIAN AMERICAN JUDGES AND ACTUALLY ALL JUDGES I MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ASIAN AMERICAN TO HIRE AN ASIAN AMERICAN RIGHT. BUT THE NUMBERS IT'S NOT. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. THANK YOU THANK YOU YOUR HONOR THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH LEGISLATION THANK YOU FOR THE STATE. ACTUALLY WE GO NEXT PANEL THAT. THANK YOU.

BREAKING POINT I KEEP WE DREAM OF A WORLD WHERE WHAT WE WATCHING OR SCREENS REFLECTS THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE STRATEGICALLY WE HAVE TARGETED TO CRITICAL ACCESS POINTS IN HOLLYWOOD ONE WRITERS BECAUSE DIVERSITY STARTS ON THE PAGE AND TWO EXECUTIVES BECAUSE INCLUDE STARTS. WITH THE GATEKEEPERS.

REPUTATION WE HAVE NOW BECOME THE GO TO SOURCE FOR ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER WRITERS WE'VE GOTTEN NUMEROUS WRITERS NOT JUST OUR GRADUATES STAFF AND SHOWS AND FEATURE FILM WRITING GIGS. WE HAVE THE LARGEST AND MOST IN DEPTH DATABASE OF ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER WRITERS IN HOLLYWOOD. NOW SUPPORTING WRITERS IS IMPORTANT. BUT WE ALSO NEED THE CORPS LETTER FORCE EXECUTIVES WHO WILL GREEN LIGHT AND CHAMPION OUR PROJECTS. ASIAN AMERICAN PROFESSIONALS OFTEN AREN'T PROMOTED BECAUSE THEY ARE PERCEIVED AS LACKING ASSERTIVENESS AND LEADERSHIP QUALITIES WHICH ARE STEREO TYPES THAT ARE EXACERBATED BY THE MEDIA. A RECENT A SON FOUNDATION STUDY WHICH I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT LATER THIS AFTERNOON. FOUND THAT ASIANS ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE HIRED. BUT THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE PROMOTED. TOWARD THAT END. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE LAUNCHED THE CAPE LEADERS FELLOWSHIP THIS FOCUSES ON JUNIOR EXECUTIVES JUST BELOW THE VICE PRESIDENT RANK AND CREATIVE DECISION MAKING DEPARTMENTS THAT IS DEVELOPMENT CURRENT I'M PRODUCTION. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING LEADERSHIP NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS THIS FELLOWSHIP STRENGTHENS IMPORTANT NETWORKS OPEN DOORS AND PROVIDES ACCESS TO INDUSTRY LEADERS THAT ARE OFTEN OUT OF REACH FOR LOWER LEVEL EXECUTIVES. THIS FELLOWSHIP IS THE ONLY JUNIOR EXECUTIVE FELLOWSHIP IN HOLLYWOOD AND WE BECOME THE GO TO SOURCE FOR ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER EXECUTIVES IN A SHORT PERIOD OF OUR FELLOWSHIPS EXISTENCE WE HAVE PLACED SEVERAL EXECUTIVES WITH GREAT OPPORTUNITIES. NO MEDIA IS THE QUICKEST AND MOST PERVASIVE WAY TO SHAPE PERCEPTION PERCEPTION AN INTERN REALITY. BECAUSE IMAGES MATTER. THE IMAGES WE SEE AFFECT OUR PERCEPTIONS OF OTHERS AS WELL AS OF OURSELVES. BUT MEDIA ALSO HAS THE POWER TO CREATE CHANGE IN THE TIME THAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A MOVIE TO CREATE A TELEVISION SHOW WE CAN CHANGE WHAT THAT FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE. ON THE TELEVISION SIDE WE NEED MORE ASIAN AMERICAN SHOW RUNNERS THE SHOW RUNNER IS THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP THE PERSON WITH THE OVERALL CREATIVE AUTHORITY AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY OF A TV SHOW. THIS IS A TV WRITERS ROOM HIERARCHY. AT THE TOP WE HAVE THE SHOW RUNNER. ALL THE WAY DOWN TO STAFF WRITER. TO BE A SHOW RUNNER EXECUTIVE PRODUCER COEXECUTIVE PRODUCER CONSULTING PRODUCER SUPERVISING PRODUCER PRODUCER COPRODUCER EXECUTIVE STORY EDITOR STORY EDITOR AND STAFF WRITER SO QUITE A HIERARCHY. NOW A DIRTY A STUDY OF THE 200-017-2000 EIGHTEEN TV STAFFING SEASON FOUND THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE LARGELY CONCENTRATED AT THE LOWER LEVELS. SPECIFICALLY IT NOTED THAT SYSTEM SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WRITERS FROM HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS REMAINS PERVASIVE IN THE HIRING OF TELEVISION WRITERS AND THAT THE DISCRIMINATION IS WORSE AT THE UPPER LEVELS. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED SCRIPTED SHOWS. FIVE HUNDRED ON VARIOUS PLATFORMS TODAY. BY OUR COUNT THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT THIRTY FIVE ASIAN AMERICAN SHOW RUNNERS. THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CANNOT HAVE MORE SHOW RUNNERS CALLING THE SHOTS. I OFTEN RECEIVE CALLS OR EMAILS FROM EXECUTIVES AND PRODUCERS WHO SAY. WE NEED A SHOW RUNNER WE PICKED UP A SHOW WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN ASIAN AMERICAN SHOW RUNNER SOMETIMES THEIR SUPER SPECIFIC AND ASK ME FOR A CHINESE FEMALE DRAMA SHOW RUNNER. WHEN I RESPONDS WELL THERE ARE TWO. I TELL THEM. AND DIANA SON AND THEY'RE BOTH BUSY MAY I RECOMMEND SOME KHLOE PEAS OR OTHER EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN SHOW RUNNERS YET BUT WHO ARE READY. AND I CONTINUALLY GET TURNED DOWN THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS WELL WE REALLY WANT SOMEONE WHO'S RUN A SHOW BEFORE. THIS YEAR'S PILOT SEASON THERE WERE AT LEAST SIX ASIAN AMERICAN CENTER PILOTS THAT WOULD HAVE HAD AN ASIAN AMERICAN SHOW RUNNER. OF THOSE. ONLY ONE SUNNY SIDE WAS ORDERED TO SERIES. ON THE BRIGHT SIDE THERE ARE A FEW NON ASIAN AMERICAN CENTRIC PILOTS THAT WERE ORDERED TO SERIES THAT HAVE ASIAN AMERICAN SHOW RUNNERS INCLUDING NANCY DREW GREMLINS CENTRAL PARK GENTRIFIED WU TANG ONE PIECE AND A FEW OTHERS SOME OF WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED YET. SO THERE'S HOPE. AND ALSO YOU DON'T HAVE TO. RUN AN ASIAN AMERICANS SHOW IF YOU'RE A GREAT WRITER AND A GOOD SHOWING THERE COULD BE ANY SHOW. ON THE FILM SIDE. THE TAX CREDIT THAT YOU WORKED ON WAS FABULOUS AND I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING INTO THE USE OF INCLUSION RIDERS. ACCORDING TO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA REPORT. ASIANS OVER INDEX I'M GOING TO THE MOVIES. IT'S TIME FOR MORE FILMS TO REFLECT THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE. AND IT'S INCUMBENT ON ALL OF US. AS AUDIENCES TO SUPPORT THOSE FILMS DURING OPENING WEEKENDS WHICH WE ARE DOING THROUGH THE GOLD OPEN MOVEMENT. THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING TO ADD MORE CRACKS TO THE GLASS CEILING IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. LET'S REACH THE BREAKING POINT TOGETHER. AND. MIKE THANK YOU MISLED. WHAT. THE MORNING OF THE FIRST THANK YOU SO MUCH AS SENATOR PAN SOME REMEMBER BURN AND THAT SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE AND THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY AND ALSO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE SUPPORT YOU'VE OFFERED IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS. IN THAT A GNARLY TIME. SO YOU FOR A LOT OF AGGRAVATE. IT DOES STICK SO I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK MORE FROM A PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW AND FROM AN INSIDER'S POINT OF VIEW IN HOLLYWOOD. SO ONE OF THE FIRST TELEVISION SHOWS I RODE ON I CREATED A CHARACTER WHO WAS. A DASHING LADIES MET SOMEONE WHO HAD A DOMINANT PERSONALITY AT WORK. AND I TOLD MY SHOWRUNNER I WANTED AN ASIAN MAN TO PLAY THIS PART. AND MY CHILDREN THEN SAID HE COULDN'T SEE THAT TOO BUT TO HIS CREDIT HE SAID TO GO AHEAD IF I COULD FIND THE RIGHT ACTOR FOR THE ROLE HE WOULD SUPPORT IT. SO I SENT THE CHARACTER DESCRIPTION FOR CASTING DEPARTMENT AT THE NETWORK. AND ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS THEY ASKED WAS CAN YOU FEEL IT TINO OR AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND WHEN I SAID NO THE SENT US A HANDFUL OF HIS LEAST ROUNDED UP ACTORS WHO WERE NOWHERE CLOSE TO HITTING THE MARK. THEY EXPLAINED THAT THE KIND OF GOOD LOOKING CHARMING TALENTED SEXUALLY CONFIDENT ASIAN MALE I WAS LOOKING FOR DID NOT EXIST. CAN BE FOUND. THANKFULLY I WAS CO WRITING THE SCRIPT WITH ANOTHER ASIAN AMERICAN WRITER WHO TOOK THIS VERY PERSONALLY AND TOGETHER. WE PUSHED ON CASTING AND REFUSED TO CONCEDE UNTIL THEY FOUND IS THE RIGHT ACTOR. DIG DEEPER. AND EVENTUALLY THEY DID THE ACTOR WAS AMAZING WONDERFUL THE EPISODE TURNED OUT WELL AND HE BROUGHT SO MUCH TO THE ROLE AND HE IS YOU KNOW IT'S CONTINUED TO ACT AND STAR IN. A BE FEATURED IN A TELEVISION SERIES. THIS WAS SIXTEEN YEARS AGO. AND SINCE THEN I'VE WORKED ON A VARIETY OF SHOWS BUT OFTEN I RUN INTO THE SAME SITUATION AGAIN AND AGAIN. ON ONE OF THE LAST SHOWS I WAS ON WE HAD A VILLAIN CHARACTER WHO WAS PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY INTIMIDATING. AND I WANTED TO LOOK AT USING ACTORS FOR THE PART AND THAT SHOW RUNNER SAID YOU COULDN'T SEE IT. AND THIS TIME HE DID NOT TO GIVE ME THE GO AHEAD TO PURSUE THAT. SO WHAT I WILL. THAT IF I WANT TO CAST AN ASIAN ACTOR IN A PART. THAT ISN'T GENERIC MUGGING VICTIM NUMBER TWO OR STEER TYPICALLY ASIAN NAIL SALON WORKERS SEX TRAFFICKING VICTIM FOR WOMEN. OR COMPUTER TECH ENGINEER TRIAD MEMBER FOR MEN. I WOULD GET VARYING DEGREES OF PUSH BACK WHETHER IT'S FROM THE SHOW RUNNERS CASTING A STUDIO EXECUTIVES. NO ONE WOULD EVER OPENLY SAY WE DON'T WANT TO CAST ASIANS THAT WOULD JUST BE A SILENCE OR I'D GET A LIST OF POTENTIAL ACTORS WERE NOT ASIAN. OR THEY SAY THEY WERE ALL FOR PROMOTING DIVERSITY BUT THE TALENT POOL SIMPLY ISN'T THERE. THESE ARE BATTLES I. IN OTHER API CREATORS ARE USED TO FIGHTING. BUT EVEN WHEN WE DO SUCCEED THAT VICTORY FEELS FAN. THE PARTS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT ARE FOR SMALLER ROLES. OF THE DOZEN TV SHOWS I'VE WORKED ON ALL THE LEAD ROLES WHAT WE CALL NUMBER ONE ON THE CALL SHEET OUR WHITE. AND FOR THAT MATTER NUMBER TWO THREE AND SOMETIMES FOUR WHITE. NUMBER FIVE SOMETIMES AND THAT'S WHERE YOU SORT OF BERRY LIKE YOU KNOW DETECTIVE NUMBER FOUR AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE YOU GET YOUR PERSON OF COLOR ON ON THAT TV SHOW. I'M THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE HASN'T BEEN. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY BREAK OUT MEANINGFUL ROLES FOR API ACTORS. CENTER AND KILLING EVE THE WHOLE CAST OF FRESH OF THE BOAT J. CHOI AND SINGLE PARENTS I JIM MILLER JIM MAIL AND- MANY JUSTIN SO IN A GOOD PLACE AND JUST TO NAME A FEW. BUT WE SHOULD NOT TAKE THIS PROGRESS FOR GRANTED. STUDIOS STILL CLAIM THAT YOU'RE PROMOTING DIVERSITY M. VISIBILITY BY CASTING ASIANS IN WHAT. YOU WOULD VIEW AS MINOR AND SOMETIMES INTERCHANGEABLE ROLES. AND THE TRUTH IS THOSE TOKEN EFFORTS TO PROMOTE. IT TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY YOU KNOW ACTUALLY PROMOTES ANOTHER DAMAGING NARRATIVE SWITCHES ASIANS CAN BE BIT PLAYERS BUT THEY ARE NOT THE HEROES OF THE STORY. AND THIS BEGS THE QUESTION WHY ISN'T THERE MORE CONTENT FEATURING ASIAN LEADS AND STORIES. FIRST ALTHOUGH AS MITCHELL POINTED OUT THE NUMBERS ARE IMPROVING THERE'S A LACK OF API CONTENT CREATORS. AND EVEN FOR THOSE OF US WHO BECOME SUCCESSFUL SHOW RUNNERS WRITERS DIRECTORS. DIRECTORS WE FACE A GAUNTLET OF OBSTACLES WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO GET OR SELL SHOWS WITH LEADS WHO LOOK LIKE US. I KNOW AND HAVE COMMISERATE WITH SEVERAL EXPERIENCE WELL REGARDED API WRITERS WHO SUCCESSFULLY SUCCESSFULLY RUN SHOWS WITH WHITE LEADS BUT CAN'T LAUNCH SHOWS WITH ASIAN LEADS. AND THE CONSENSUS SEEMS TO BE THAT AMONG THE DEVELOPMENT EXECUTIVES AND PRODUCERS WHO ARE OVERWHELMINGLY WHITE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE STORIES UNDERSTAND THE CULTURAL SPECIFICITY AND BECAUSE THEY CAN'T RELATE TO OUR STORIES. AS A RESULT WE DON'T CHAMPION THEM. THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS OF COURSE THIS PAST YEAR WE'VE HAD A WEALTH OF ASIAN DRIVEN MOVIE HITS. SUCH AS TO ALL THE BOYS OF LOVE BEFORE SEARCHING ALWAYS BE MY MAYBE AND OF COURSE CRAZY RICH ASIANS. WHICH TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY PROVED MAINSTREAM AMERICA IS READY AND ENTHUSIASTIC TO C. API DRIVEN CONTENT. THE STUDIO SYSTEM IS SLOW TO ADAPT. AFTER THE BOX OFFICE SUCCESS A CRAZY RICH ASIANS THERE WAS TALK OF THIS NEW ERA IN HOLLYWOOD AND THAT THERE WAS A RECORD NUMBER OF ASIAN DRIVEN PROJECTS BEING PICKED UP. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THAT WAS A YEAR AGO OF THE NUMBER OF SHOWS THAT WERE AT LEAST DEVELOPED. AS MITCHELL POINTED OUT ONE WAS PICKED OUT FOR NETWORK BROADCAST PRIMETIME. THE BIGGER ISSUE. IS NOT JUST GIVING OPPORTUNITIES TO ASIAN ACTORS I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT. MOVIES AND TV ARE A MIRROR TO AMERICA. I WAS AN IMMIGRANT I GREW UP IN MALAYSIA I CAME HERE WHEN I WAS NINETEEN AND EVERYTHING I KNEW ABOUT AMERICA WAS FROM MOVIES IT'S WHY I WANTED TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY TO BE PART OF SOMETHING AMAZING. HAVING WORKED IN IT I KNOW NOW IT IS A DISTORTED MIRROR. ONE THAT HAS SELECTIVELY IGNORE THE FACES STORIES AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR COMMUNITY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION IS BUT I DO KNOW THAT IT STARTS WITH SHINING A SPOTLIGHT ON THE DEEP SYSTEMIC ISSUES FACING OUR CREATIVE COMMUNITY TODAY. CALLING OUT BY IS UNFAIR BLATANTLY RACIST PRACTICES WHEN WE SEE THEM. INSTEAD OF GOING ALONG TO GET ALONG. AND PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE STUDIOS TO MAKE MEANINGFUL CHANGES. IN THE PRACTICE IS TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY AND NOT JUST PAYING IT LIP SERVICE. IF THEY CLAIM THEY CAN'T C. S. LET'S MAKE SURE THE AT LEAST CAN HEAR US. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS SERVER CHOW JIM I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP ON YOUR LAST COMMENT. AND THEN. YEAH BY PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE STUDIOS. YOU KNOW WHAT SPECIFICALLY CAN WE DO I MEAN AT YOU KNOW HE IS REFERRING TO LET'S SAY AS A **** AS WE COULD PROBABLY OF VOICE ALL CONCERNED PROBABLY UP IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW THAT WE COULD CUT. IT CANNOT DO AS AS AS A AS A AS A BODY. ABSOLUTELY I. THERE WAS MUCH OF THE TAX CREDIT STUDIOS ABSOLUTELY RESPOND TO THE PRESSURE FROM THE PUBLIC AND PRESSURE FROM LAWMAKERS PARTICULARLY WHEN THEIR TAX INCENTIVES DANGLED IN FRONT OF THEM AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAN BE IT PUT TO THEM IS JUST TO IMPROVE THE EXISTING NUMBERS. AND THAT REALLY DOES COME FROM HIRING API CONTENT CREATORS NOT JUST SUPERFICIALLY BOOSTING THEIR NUMBERS IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW LOWER LEVEL WRITERS ON TV SHOWS THAT ARE BEING HIRED BECAUSE WHEN YOU HIRE A WHEN YOU HIRE AN API CONTENT CREATOR DIRECTOR FOR FILM OR A SHOW RUNNER FOR TELEVISION. THERE ARE CHANGES UP AND DOWN THE RANKS WHETHER IT'S IN CASTING AND CREW BEHIND THE SCENES ALL OF THOSE NUMBERS CHANGE AT AS A REACTION TO THAT. NOW YOU MENTIONED I THINK I THINK WAS MACHEL MENTION ABOUT THE TAX CREDIT ANDY INCLUSION WRITERS SO SPECIFICALLY YOU KNOW AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THE LEGISLATURE LEVEL CAN YOU THINK OF ANY ANY OTHER MEASURES THAT. WE COULD TAKE ON IT AS AS A WHOLE. I THINK IF WE CAN CONTINUE PUSHING ON THOSE LEVERS THAT WE HAVE AND- AND ALSO IF THERE'S MORE EVEN JUST. SHINING THE SPOTLIGHT SAYING WHAT ARE SOME OF WHICH ARE YOUR NUMBERS OF EXECUTIVES I DON'T THINK I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY STUDY. AND MAYBE SOMEONE ON TODAY'S PANEL WILL HOPEFULLY WE'LL DO A STUDY AFTER TODAY WHAT DOES. HOLLY WOULD SPECIFICALLY WHAT IS THERE EXECUTIVE RANKS LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF THEIR- API MAKE UP. SCOTT AND. SO MY CAR THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH FOR THE WITH EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN DOING I KNOW LET ME SHOW WHEN SOME OF US MIKE **** HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH YOU THE LOS ANGELES WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE INDUSTRY I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT A SHOW RUNNER WAS THE TIMES I'M GLAD YOU ACTUALLY. THERE'S MORE BUREAUCRACY IN HOLLYWOOD AND POLITICS. THE GOVERNMENT. BUT BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH AND YOU MENTIONED A TAX CREDIT AND- THAT. CREDIT THE CREDIT FOR GETTING THE TAX CREDIT AND THAT CONVERSATION TO REALLY. DOESN'T BELONG LEGISLATURE IT BELONGS THE TWO OF YOU AND THE OTHERS THAT REALLY CONTINUE TO SPEAK UP AND HAVE BEEN FOR A VERY LONG TIME. A VERY LONG TIME. AND LET ME TALK ABOUT TO. THAT ONE OF THE QUOTES THAT I W. SAYS WE'RE ALL FOR DIVERSITY BUT THE TOPPLE SIMPLY ISN'T THERE. WE HEAR THAT A LOT. M. AND WE HEAR THAT ACROSS THE BOARD I THINK A LOT OF DIFFERENT YOU KNOW WOMEN HERE THAT. ALL THE TIME. BUT IF I GET ESPECIALLY DODD BUT TRACK. I GOT A LOT OF CONVERSATION TED WHEN IT COMES AFTER MIKE LEFT IN THIS THAT. TOPPLED AS THEIR AND HOLLY WOULD CERTAINLY I THINK A NUMBER. OF MINORITY GROUPS AS WELL AS WOMEN HERE THAT OFTEN TIMES. AND IT'S UNACCEPTABLE IT'S A TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND. SO WHAT I SAY. IS THEN YOU CREATE THE TALENT POOL. AS THE PEOPLE ARE THERE THE TALENTS THERE. AND SO PART OF IT IS CERTAINLY AN IMPLICIT BIAS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN. DEALING WITH THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR ALONE ONE OF ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHILE THEY- HAD THREE DIFFERENT TWO DIFFERENT BILLS. THAT HAVE TO DEAL WITH. BUT THE COURT SYSTEM CANNELLA JUST SYSTEM OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. IN TERMS OF TRAINING ON IMPLICIT BIAS THAT MIGHT BE A DIRECTION. WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AS WELL. BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER. OF THE NUMBERS. IT'S ALSO A MATTER OF HOW WE'RE PORTRAYED. AND MIKE YOU COME HERE AND THE TV AND MOVIES AND- WHEN YOU SEE HIGHER PERPETRATED END UP BEING BULLIED BECAUSE- HOW. IN MY CASE INDIANS OF A TRADE ON TV. AND IT'S JUST. YOU KNOW TO THINK ABOUT. HOW FAR WE'VE COME AND HELP OUT WE HAVEN'T COME. AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO PORTRAYAL SO THE ONE THING IS THE NUMBERS AND THE OTHER THING IS OUR PRE TRADE. HOW CAN WE MOVE ON ON THAT ISSUE OF POWER FOR TRADE. NOT SIMPLY JUST HOW MAY WHAT THE NUMBERS. ARE WHICH IS SOMETHING WE ALL AGREE NEEDS TO IMPROVE AS WELL. I'M IN TERMS OF HOW WE ARE PORTRAYED IT. DOES REALLY GO BACK TO HAVING A PI. CONTENT CREATE. BECAUSE THERE IS. WHAT WE DO IS SO SUBJECTIVE. AND THERE IS A PREP THE PROBLEM IDEA THAT WHITE MALE SHOW RUNNERS WHITE MALE FEATURE WRITERS CAN WRITE FOR ANYBODY. WHERE AS WE ARE RELEGATED TO ONLY WRITE NEEDS ONLY WRITING FOR YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITY. AND I DON'T HAVE TO TELL THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM BUT YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO HAVE WALKED IN THOSE SHOES TO BE ABLE TO WRITE FROM THAT CHARACTER FOR THAT CHARACTER. TO PROVIDE AN AUTHENTIC POINT OF VIEW A UNIQUE WORLD VIEW THERE'S NOTHING THAT REALLY EXPO REPLACES. LIFE EXPERIENCE AND AGAIN I WANT TO LIVE IN THE IDEAL WORLD WHERE EVERYONE CAN RIGHT FOR EVERYONE BUT THAT COMES WITH HAVING A GREAT UNDERSTANDING AND APPRECIATION AND AFFECTION FOR THAT CULTURE. AND A LOT OF TIMES IT'S SIMPLY NOT THERE YOU KNOW FOR A LOOK FOR A LOT OF THESE WRITERS. SO I WOULD SAY THAT IN TERMS OF HOW WE ARE PORTRAYED WHEN I TALK ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE OF SHOW RUNNERS SAYING YOU KNOW I JUST CAN'T SEE THAT. YEAH RIGHT SPECIFICALLY FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW OF GROWING UP IN YOU KNOW A WEALTHY SUBURB ON THE EAST COAST HAVING GONE TO A REALLY GREAT SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW THERE ONE CIRCLE OF FRIENDS IF THEY DON'T SEE. PEOPLE OF COLOR YOU KNOW WHAT. OCCUPY A CERTAIN SPACE IN THEIR LIVES THEY DON'T NEED IT AND IT DOES MATTER THAT WE ON STAFF HAVE C. HAVE THOSE PEOPLE GREW UP WITH THOSE PEOPLE HAVE TO TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT BECAUSE WHAT WE DO IS SUBJECT IF THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT. SO REALLY IT IS A BOTTOM AND YOU KNOW THE AMAZING. THE I. WRITERS AND- WRITERS WHO ARE. TO GO OUT AND DEVELOP AND SELL. FROM THE STUDIOS PICK UP THOSE SHOWS BECAUSE AGAIN BECAUSE THERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME SUMMER CAMP EXPERIENCES AS WE DO WITH THE FAMILY EXPERIENCES YOU KNOW THE IT'S LESS LIKELY FOR AN EXECUTIVE OR SOMEONE WITH GREENLIGHT POWER TO SAVE I LOVE THAT STORY I HAD THAT EXPERIENCE I'M GOING TO BACK IT ALL THE WAY THAT THE CHANCES OF THAT HAPPENING WITH ONE OF OUR PROJECT IS MUCH MUCH LOWER. IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY IS ALMOST COMICAL TO ME THAT THAT'S THIS. IT'S LIKE WOMEN PEOPLE COLOR WE HAVE THE CODES WHICH ALL THE TIME WE HAVE NO LEGAL UNDER ROOM. HOW DO WE HAVE TO CHANGE OURSELVES TO BE ACCEPTED IN THAT ROOM. AND WHITE MAN ON THE TOTEM POLE APART ON THE BOTTOM OF THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO C. PERSPECTIVE OTHER PEOPLE. BECAUSE THE SOCIETY WHERE. SO BUT IT'S NOT UNUSUAL THAT'S THE NORM I THINK IN MANY INDUSTRIES WHERE. THE NORMATIVE PERSPECTIVE IS THE WHITE MALE PERSPECTIVE. BUT YOU THINK THAT ENTERTAINMENT. IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT THAT'S THE NORM IN ANY INDUSTRY IS COMICAL. BUT IN ENTERTAINMENT WHEN YOU REALLY WANT TO TRY TO. HAVE INTERESTING STORIES AND I SEE ALL THESE NEW SHOWS COMING OUT IT'S THE SAME. KIND OF SAME KIND OF EITHER DRAMA OR SIT COM WITH ALL WHITE MILK WHAT WHAT ALL WHITE CAST. THE SAME THING THEY JUST REGURGITATE OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO I JUST SAW AN INTERESTING. I JUST LIKE TO ADD ONE OF A SMALL NOTE TO THE IS THAT THE THRESHOLD OF. THERE IS ALSO DIFFERENT FOR US. IN ANY GIVEN YEAR WE HAVE A LOT OF. PILOTS THAT YOU WILL NEVER SEE YOU KNOW THEY'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND WHEN IT IS AS YOU KNOW A SHOW RUNNER WITH. A WHITE SHOW AND IT FEELS IT'S WELL THE CHEMISTRY WASN'T RIGHT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GET IT RIGHT. TIME. BUT IF YOU ARE AN AGENT JANET SURE MINE. DRIVEN. VERSUS YOU KNOW IT THEY COULD HAVE. AGAIN WHAT WE DO. SO SUBJECTIVE IT'S IT IT'S AN ALCHEMY ALMOST AND SO YOU KNOW IT. IT REALLY HURTS THE- THE WHOLE THE CAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. WHEN OUR RACE BECOMES THE WITH M. THE REASON FOR THE FAILURE. RENTED PIGGYBACKING ON THAT THAT MAKES THE- WINDOW. EXTREMELY SMALL BECAUSE THE BARRIER TO ENTRY IS SO HIGH FOR US. NOW IS TO GET THERE WHEN WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO FAIL AND THEN WHEN WE DO IT'S NOT LIKE JUST CLOSES. I HAVE ONE MORE COMMENT OUT THIS PAST WEEKEND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A PART OF THE PRE SCREENING OF THE- THE UPCOMING MOVIE D. ABOMINABLE. WHICH BASICALLY IS THE FIRST ANIMATED MOVIE. FEATURING AN ASIAN CAST I GUESS SO THAT'S THAT'S THE PROMISED. AND I YEAH I TOOK YOU KNOW TOOK A LOOK AT IT AND WAS VERY. VERY MOVING IN IN IN MANY YOU KNOW A GREAT RESPECT. AND MY QUESTION TO YOU IS DO YOU FOR C. R. MORE OF THAT SIMILAR KIND OF. WORK BEING PUT OUT THERE I YEAH I MET SOME OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO. WERE PART OF THE DEAL THE WORK AND I WAS EXCITED BECAUSE I SEE. HEY LOOK YOU KNOW WE HAVE HOPE YET SO YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THIS IS RIGHT AFTER A CRAZY CRAZY WHICH ASIAN. BUT SO I YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE GONNA PREVIEW IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS OR SO BUT BUT SO YOU SEE. MORE WORK LIKE THAT COMING COMING UP. ACTUALLY WORKING ON A DISNEY ANIMATED FEATURE RIGHT NOW THAT IS IT'S A FANTASY. IT'S A FANTASY WORLD BUT INSPIRED BY SOUTHEAST ASIA AND WE WILL HAVE AN ALL ASIAN CAST AND GO WITH AN EMPHASIS ON AS SOUTHEAST ASIA AS WELL. SO YOU KNOW IT IF IT BUT IT'S ONE PROJECT I CAN'T SPEAK TO PROMISING THAT THERE WILL BE MORE AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF. THE DISCUSSION AS WELL. AFTER CRAZY RICH THERE WAS THAT FEELING THAT WELL THINGS ARE CHANGING WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ANYMORE. BUT THE THING TO BEAR IN MIND WAS WEAK BUT THE FIRST ALL ASIAN CAST CONTEMPORARY HOLLYWOOD MOVIE AND THE LAST WAS JOY LUCK CLUB WHICH WAS TWENTY FIVE. YEARS AGO SO THAT'S A LONG TIME IN COMING AND SO WHILE I'M EXCITED TO BE WORKING ON THIS MOVIE. AND HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE A LOT MORE I THINK WE SHOULD NEVER TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT. THIS JUST SHOWS A CHANGING TIDE AND THAT'S JUST HOW THE FACTORY IS GOING TO MOVE FROM THIS POINT FORWARD. I THINK IT'S CONSTANT VIGILANCE AND CONSTANTLY YOU KNOW FIGHTING KEEPING AN EYE ON IT. THANKS. I JUST I HAVE A QUESTION. SO WE I THINK A LOT OF IT IN TERMS OF YOU TALKED ABOUT THE HOLLYWOOD CULTURE AND WHAT WE CAN TRY TO DO TO CHANGE THAT BUT IN TERMS OF. BEYOND THE FILM TAX CREDIT YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE API COMMUNITY I THINK IN ENTERTAINMENT OR STREET OR SOME INTEREST AS WELL AS YOU KNOW TERMS OF PROFITS COMING FROM OVERSEAS AND SO FORTH. IS WHAT WAY KIM IS OUR OPPORTUNITIES OR LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES TO THAT ON THE FINANCING AND IN TERMS OF THE PURCHASING POWER OF API PEOPLE INVEST WHO API WHO ELSE WHO IS DESTINED ENTERTAINMENT AND SO FORTH TO BASICALLY LEVERAGE THAT TO GET MORE CREATIVES TO DEMAND MORE PEOPLE OUR SHOW RUNNERS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS A IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY THERE OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW AS WE THINK ABOUT CROSS SECTORS HOW DO WE PUT PRESSURE ON THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY SAY NO ACTUALLY WE WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE NOT TO PUT OUR MONEY THERE. I REMAIN THE CALL OF. A FEW YEARS AGO THERE WAS SOME TIGHT WITH. ONE OF THE IMMIGRATION LEASES THAT IF PEOPLE INVEST FROM OVERSEAS INCHES LIKE A REAL ESTATE PROJECTS OR A FILM PROJECT THEN THEY COULD THAT WOULD HELP THEM GET A VISA I DON'T KNOW IF THAT. STILL EXISTS TODAY. IS THAT A BUFFET. FIVE YEAH. I KNOW THAT OKAY I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SOME KIND OF TIED AT THAT COULD BE LIKE ACROSS SECTORS THING. PERHAPS RICHARD. EVERY THOUGHT MANY TERMS OF I YEAH YOU HAVE TO HI ARE YOU THERE AND THEN THE PEOPLE ARE FINANCING THESE PROJECTS SO IS I MEAN D. C. THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES AND- WHAT. I THINK IN THE ABOMINABLE EXAMPLE IS VERY GOOD DOES IT COPRODUCTION BETWEEN DREAMWORKS AND PRO STUDIO AND SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT MORE. CHINESE CO PRODUCTIONS COMING DOWN AND I MEAN IF A BOMB LARA DOES WELL THE NEXT ONE IS OVER THE MOON AND THEY'VE GOT A WHOLE SLATE. LINED UP THAT THEY CAN KEEP MAKING THESE FILMS AS LONG AS THEY DO WELL IN THE BOX OFFICE AGAIN TURNS BACK TO. THE REST OF US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING IT OPENING WEEKEND. BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS WITH THE CO PRODUCTIONS AND IF THERE'S ANY LEVERS THAT YOU CAN PUNCH. ON THAT END. AND ANY THOUGHTS FROM FROM THE POSITION AS A WRITER IS THAT IT EVEN IN THE IN THE UNIVERSE OR IS THAT JUST. FINANCE IS I'M OUT OF MY DEPTH THEY WAS WHAT MY MOTHER WANTS ME TO MAJOR IN IN COLLEGE AND I SADLY I DID NOT I JUST BECAME A WRITER. BUT IT YOU KNOW I FROM A PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW IN TERMS OF WHAT STUDIOS ARE AFFECTED BY IT REALLY. IT'S SAD TO SAY I WISH IT WASN'T THE CASE BUT IT IS A LOT OF TIMES YOU KNOW EITHER PUBLIC SHAMING OR SOMEHOW YOU KNOW. INCENTIVES FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEIR PRODUCTIONS YOU KNOW LOCALLY BETTER AT LEAST WORK AT LEAST FOR CALIFORNIA YEAH THAT WAS A LOT OF GRUMBLING IT. A LOT OF DOCTORS USED TO BE CENTERED IN LOS ANGELES AROUND CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE LOSING A LOT OF THAT TO ATLANTA TO YOU KNOW NINE NORTH AND- I THINK LIKE SOUTH CAROLINA. LOUISIANA AND THERE IS THAT APPS ABSOLUTELY THAT INTEREST IN LIKE YOU KNOW PULLING THE PULLING PRODUCTION BACK TO CALIFORNIA. SO I FEEL LIKE THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD AREA. TERMS OF LEVERAGE OKAY GREAT. I THINK THERE IS SET UP OKAY GET ALL AREA THAT THAT'S ONE AREA THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FURTHER EXPLORED YET YOU KNOW THAT REQUIRES COAL PRODUCTION I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY HELP OUT TO SOME EXTENT DEPENDING ON WHAT IT IS BUT IF THAT'S WERE YOU KNOW WERE THE ACTION COULD BEAT AND YOU KNOW WE'LL BE HAPPY TO HELP OUT IN FACT A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE SPEAKER AND I PLAYED A DELEGATION TO CHINA TO BASICALLY PROMOTE. EXCHANGES BETWEEN YOU KNOW IN A FEMINIST BETWEEN THE TWO BETWEEN FORTY AND CHINA AND SO YOU KNOW ALONG THE WAY WE FOUND OUT SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE PLACED ON FOLKS WHO WANT TO INVEST IN CHINA AND VICE VERSA SO YOU KNOW THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO ESSENTIALLY TO. KIND OF HELP PROMOTE OR YOU KNOW THE FACILITATOR TO I ENTITIES SO YOU THINK OF ANYTHING THAT WE COULD KIND OF HELP. OUT YOU KNOW MORE SPECIFIC PLEASE LET US KNOW ALSO. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH THANK YOU I THINK I THINK. RIGHT OKAY SO NEXT UP IS OUR PAN ON JOURNALISM AND I'D LIKE TO WELCOME TED HAN THE NATIONAL VICE PRESIDENT ON FINANCE FOR THE ASIAN AMERICAN JOURNALISTS ASSOCIATION. TED HOW IS A CONSOLE THAT ENTREPRENEUR HE HAS WORKED WITH NEWS ORGANIZATIONS IN JOURNALISM NOT PROFITS AROUND THE WORLD AND CURRENTLY SERVES AS A BOARD MEMBER OF THE EIGHT AN AMERICAN JOURNAL. C. H. AND ACTUALLY AND BETH YES HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU TO SENATOR PAN IN THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING US HERE I'M JULIE P. CHAN I AM THE MANAGING EDITOR OF DIGITAL AT KQED WHICH IS THE LARGEST PUBLIC MEDIA ORGANIZATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA I ALSO SERVE ON THE NATIONAL BOARD OF THE ASIAN AMERICAN JOURNALISTS ASSOCIATION AND M. IN THE PRESS AND M. THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL BAY AREA CHAPTER. THIS IS TED HAN AND EVERY CAN HEAR ME ALRIGHT AS SENATOR PAN SAID I DO SUFFER CONSULTING I'M ALSO ON THE NATIONAL BOARD AND I HAVE WORKED WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS SIX OF THOSE. WITH A JOURNAL THE NOT FOR PROFIT INVESTIGATIVE REPORTERS AND EDITORS. OKAY HELLO TO BOTH OF YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. SO JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON THE ASIAN AMERICAN JOURNALISTS ASSOCIATION WHICH WILL BE REFERRING TO AS AJ IT WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WHICH IS EASY FOR ME TO REMEMBER BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO MY AIR. TO CREATE A COMMUNITY OF SUPPORT FOR JOURNALISTS OF ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER BACKGROUNDS. THE ORGANIZATION RECOGNIZED EARLY ON THAT JOURNALISTS NEED TO SUPPORT AT EVERY LEVEL OF THEIR CAREER FROM EXPIRING JOURNALISTS IN HIGH SCHOOL COLLEGE EARLY CAREER MADE CAREER. THOSE LOOKING TOWARDS LEADERSHIP AND THOSE FEW OF US THERE WERE FORTUNOFF TO ACHIEVE LEADERSHIP POSITIONS. SO AJ REALLY IDENTIFIED THIS PROBLEM WITH THE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN THE JOURNALISM INDUSTRY PRETTY EARLY ON AND TRIES TO ADDRESS IT THROUGH PROGRAMMING AND STRATEGY WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. STRATEGY AND OUTRAGE SO TODAY WE WANT TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THE NEEDLE HAS MOVED VERY LITTLE ON THE DESERT DIVERSITY INCLUSION FRONTS IN THE JOURNALISM INDUSTRY IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE ULTIMATELY IS THE COVERAGE OF OUR COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND OUR CAREER TRAJECTORIES WHICH WILL GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO AS FAR AS HOW MESSY IT IS ESPECIALLY ADDITIONAL SPACE WHAT I REALLY APPRECIATED ABOUT THE ENTERTAINMENT PANEL WAS THAT HIERARCHY. OF THE TV'S WRITERS GROUP. I WANT THAT FOR THE DIGITAL SPACE I THINK YOU KNOW NOT ONLY HAS OUR INDUSTRY BEEN DISRUPTED BY YOU KNOW A VERY BUSINESS ORIENTED CHALLENGES AS FAR AS FINDING A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL DECLINING AD DOLLARS. BUT ALSO AT THE TECH INNOVATIONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED AND LEGACY ORGANIZATIONS NEEDING TO PAVE IT OR MORE DIGITAL START UPS KIND OF SPROUTING UP WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NICE AND NEAT LIKE THAT SO WE'RE STILL VERY MUCH MAPPING OUT. TRAJECTORIES FOR FOLKS AND WHAT CAREERS CAN LOOK LIKE. THAT ACTUALLY IS REFLECTED IN THE DATA THAT WE'VE GOT OUR M. OUR INDUSTRY RELIES ON A SURVEY BY THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEWS EDITORS WHICH THEY STARTED COLLECTING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. AND THAT THE SERVICE CHANGE A LITTLE BIT OVER THAT TIME BUT BROADLY SPEAKING THE SERVER NUMBERS INDICATE THAT. IT IN IN BOTH AGGREGATE AND IN PROPORTION THE INDUSTRY HASN'T REALLY MADE A SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. AND SOME YOU KNOW THERE ARE A FEW BRIGHT SPOTS AND THERE ARE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE MADE IMPROVEMENTS OVER THAT TIME. BUT GENERAL CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRY AND- REALLY LEAVE LARGE GAPS AND HOLES YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT DOES IT MEAN AT THE WASHINGTON POST HAS IMPROVED THEIR DIVERSITY NUMBERS. TO PEOPLE LIVING IN STOWE OR YOU KNOW TENAQUIP. I'M AND- ARE ARE REALLY LARGE CHALLENGE IS HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT COVERAGE AND JUST THE WAY THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS REALLY CHANGED. WE HAVE SEEN A GENERAL COLLAPSE OF LOCAL REPORTING. FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS AS BUSINESS MODELS OF SHIFTED FROM NEWSPAPERS AND LOCAL TV STATIONS TO ONLINE LET'S. AND WHERE THAT DOLLARS EVERY ONE OF BINGE GOOD LUCK TECH COMPANY. A FEW COMPANIES THAT HAVE MANAGED TO MAKE THAT. AND SO THAT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ABOUT IN THE SAME PLACES WHEN WE STARTED COLLECTING DATA. THERE'S A PEAK IN THE MID. TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND FIVE THROUGH TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHERE THERE IS A SLIGHT BUMP BUTTON THAT WE JUST ACTUALLY REGRESSED SINCE THEN. SO I WISH I HAD BETTER NEWS ON THAT FRONT BUT YOU KNOW THIS THIS IS ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT MAKE A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL. IN TERMS OF WHAT SORTS OF STORIES GET TOLD WHO IS TELLING THEM AND YOU KNOW HOW THEY WERE AT AT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ACCURATELY REFLECT THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LIVING. AROUND THE STATE. OKAY THANK YOU. A QUESTION THAT SOME MEMBERS OUT. OF CHURCH JUST A COUPLE. FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS SO IN LIGHT OF THE CHANGING. LANDSCAPE OF PUBLICATION I II GOING ONLINE FOR THE MOST PART. SO DO YOU SEE A DWINDLING OF API'S WHO WANT TO ENTER THAT. YOUR PROFESSION TO BEGIN WITH NO CERTAINLY NOT AND ACTUALLY. WE SOME BRIGHT PRADA HISTORY. OKAY AND ACTUALLY THE ASIAN AMERICAN JOURNALISTS ASSOCIATION WE'RE WE'RE BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO ONE OF OUR VP'S FROM YEARS PAST ACTUALLY WROTE A HISTORY OF THE FIRST FIFTEEN YEARS. AND ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THEY TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME NOW AS AS WHEN THIS WAS WRITTEN FIFTY AND- I GUESS ACTUALLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO I'M NOT INCLUDES REPRESENTATION AMONGST STUDENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED. COLLEGE STUDENTS AND THEN PEOPLE WHO ARE ENTERING THE THAT THE INDUSTRY FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS NAME NUMBERS HAVE STAYED STABLE FOR YEARS. AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WE WERE JUST READING AN EXCERPT FROM NINETEEN NINETY THAT TALKS ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM WE HAVE NOW ACROSS INDUSTRIES WHICH IS THAT WE ARE BEING HIRED. BUT WE'RE NOT BEING PROMOTED WE'RE NOT BEING EMPOWERED WERE NOT BEING ELEVATED AND EITHER THROUGH CONVERSATIONS AND THROUGH COMMUNITY BUILDING JUST IN THE JOURNALIST COLOR SPACE. YOU FOUND THAT THERE IS A THREAD A M. THAT MOST JOURNALS OF COLOR FOR REALLY FEEL ACUTELY ESPECIALLY IN THE DIGITAL. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IN A NON TRADITIONAL ROLE WHICH JOEL SPACES RIFE UP WITH BROOKE PRODUCERS. DATE OF FOLKS DEVELOPERS THOSE NON TRADITIONAL ROLES NOT THAT PORT AT THE END OF THEY'RE OFTEN NOT MIGHT NOT REDDIT. AND SO THE PROJECT RESULT REALLY MURKY THERE'S A PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR FUTURE COULD BE IN THE INDUSTRY AND SO FOLKS WILL LEAVE. NOT KNOWING YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU'RE IN THIS INDUSTRY COULD LOOK LIKE. SO SAID WHAT THEY ARE SAYING HERE IS ABOUT THE GLASS CEILING YOU SAID THAT BEGAN IN JOURNALISM. ALL THE OTHER FIELDS PEOPLE GET AP I GET HIRED. THEY'LL GET PROMOTED WHAT DO YOU THINK IS SO YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LEAST NOW WE'RE MOVING TO DIGITAL SPACE THERE'S LESS OF A CLEAR PATH AS WELL. ALTHOUGH ONE WOULD ARGUE I MEAN THAT THAT IT'S THE PATH IS CLEAR NO MATTER WHAT YOUR RACE IS SO WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS PARTICULARLY BLOCKING API FROM GETTING PROMOTED IN JOURNALISM IS THAT STEREOTYPES ABOUT. OUR YEAH ABOUT API AND OUR PEOPLE SKILLS PERHAPS ARE ARE WHAT WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT IN THE JOURNAL OF SPACE THAT KEEPS API FROM FROM MOVING UP IN THE RANKS. I'M THERE ARE. LET'S SEE HOW ABBAS FOR THIS IT. WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS WITH THERE'S THE SORT OF GENERAL QUESTION OF LIKE HOW LARGE THE PIE IS AS WELL I MEAN JUST THE NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES AS OKAY DECREASED. AND THAT THAT MEANS THAT THE COUPLE COMPETITION IS FEARS AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO PEOPLE RELY UPON WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY. RECRUITING FOR CANDIDATES IN LOOKING FOR FULL AND SO THERE'S EVEN BEEN DISCUSSIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES ABOUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE RELYING ON PEOPLE OF I BELIEVE WE GET TO CATIONS RIGHT. AND SO THE AND THE DIVERSITY CHALLENGES THAT YOU SEE IN THOSE PLACES ACTUALLY ALSO WE EXACERBATE OUR OUR. CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF HIRING PROMOTING. AND YOU KNOW WHERE EVEN. WHERE DO WHAT WHAT'S OUR ROLES TO DO ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS AND UP IN AND THERE'S A ISSUES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY BEING SLOTTED INTO FELLOWSHIP POSITIONS WHICH ARE OFTEN PAID LESS THAN THE STAFFER. AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT'S THE PROMOTION TRACK OUT OF THAT ANDERSON SO YOU ADDING ANOTHER WRONG ON THE BOTTOM FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO CLIMB UP. OKAY DIVERSITY IS OFTEN TREATED AS THIS SEPARATE TOPIC ALMOST LITERAL JOURNALISM SPACE. I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR WORK THAT WE LIKE TO PUT THINGS IN. TOPIC AREAS AND BUCKETS AND WHAT NOT BUT EVEN AT SOME OF OUR JOURNALISM CONFERENCES YOU'LL FIND THERE'S A DIVERSITY TRACK. THAT COMPETES WITH DATA JOURNALISM THAT COMPETES WITH INVESTIGATIVE AND SO IF YOU'RE A JOURNALIST TRYING TO. LEVEL UP YOU HAVE TO PICK BETWEEN DIVERSITY AND INVESTIGATIVE SKILLS LIKE THAT'S THAT'S A REALLY ODD CONFLICT THAT'S KIND OF HAPPENING THAT WE SEE. IN THE IN A VERY TANGIBLE WAY. I THINK ANOTHER VERY SPECIFIC THING THAT I'VE LOOKED AT PERSONALLY IS HIRING PROCESS HIRING PRACTICES. SO IT'D LEE. TOM AND ALICE HAVE A VERY DEMANDING JOB AND IF YOU'RE HIRING ON TOP OF IT. THAT'S ANOTHER DUTY ON TOP OF FULL TIME JOB SO TO THE CREDIT OF A LOT OF FOLKS I'VE SPOKEN TO IN LEADERSHIP I THINK. ANALYZING WHAT THAT MEANS AND HOW THAT PLAYS OUT HAS BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS MEANING IF YOU'RE TOO BUSY TO HIRE WHAT SHORT CUTS TO YOU TAKE. AND IF LEADERSHIP IN JOURNALISM IS NOT DIVERSE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THEN WHEN FOLKS UP TOP. OUR DIVERSE. OUR MAJORITY WHITE. AND THEY'RE TAKING SHORT CUTS. THAT MEANS THAT ULTIMATELY THE FOLKS BEING HIRED ARE MOST LIKELY GOING TO LEÓN THAT WAY FROM DIVERSE CANADA THEY'RE RELYING ON THEIR NETWORKS WORD IS NOW IF YOU KNOW PEOPLE THEY CAN TRUST THAT THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN TRUST TO GET THE JOB DONE AND THE QUESTION IS. ARE YOU ACTUALLY RUNNING A PROCESS THAT GIVES ALL APPLICANTS. SORT OF AN EQUAL SHOT AT GETTING THOSE ROLES SO SOME NEW IDEAS AND THESE ARE EXACTLY RIGHT AS FOR SOME IDEAS. LORD I'VE WORKED VERY WELL IS YOU KNOW COULD YOU COULD YOU BE A DEVELOPING A HIRING COMMITTEE THAT SUPPORTS THIS HIRING MANAGER WHO IS ADMITTEDLY A SHORT ON TIME. AND RESOURCES AND CAN THEY GIVE JUST A LARGER RANGE OF PERSPECTIVE. TO A CANDIDATE POOL MEETING YOU. I. ACTIVE ALL CANADA. THEY RECOGNIZE THE MORE OBSCURE PUBLICATION FOLKS WHO NO THIS PERSON TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE OFF THE WALL AND NOT IN THE TRADITIONAL KIND OF BUCKET OF JOURNALISM SELLS AND IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND JUST GIVE ALL OF A LARGER RANGE OF PERSPECTIVE TO THAT CONVERSATION AND SO HIRING COMMITTEES THAT DIVERSITY COMMITTEES THOSE HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAVE WORKED WELL TO TACKLE THIS REALLY SPECIFIC PROBLEM BUT I THINK RETENTION OF RISING RETENTION ARE STILL VERY MUCH. BOB PROBLEMS AND WE'RE DEALING WITH WE SEE THAT EVEN WITHIN AJ COMMUNITY WHERE SOME OF OUR CHAPTER LEADERS OF PEOPLE WHO LEFT THE INDUSTRY THEY THEY'RE STILL IMPORTANT RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU STARTING THEIR CAREER BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUT THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T SEE A PLACE FOR THEMSELVES. IN IN THE END. I'M A- DISTRICT. AND WHEN THE OTHER AGAIN WITH THE SHRINKING OF THE PIE IS YOU KNOW. CITIES USED TO HAVE TWO NEWSPAPERS AND SO YOU KNOW IF YOUR WRITER THAN MAYBE COULD BETH BETWEEN THEM BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE. THE ONLY SO MANY SLOTS TO LIVE IN THAT COMMUNITY AND SO YOU KNOW AND ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS ABOUT THAT AND I SHOULD MENTION ABOUT THE S. ANY SURVEY IS THAT WE THE DIRECTION THE INDUSTRY'S. HEADED IS HOW YOU BEST HOW DO YOU HOW DO WE REPRESENT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AS REFLECTED IN THE CENSUS OF THEIR ACTUAL ACTION TRYING WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE THE NEWS ROOM LITERALLY DOES REFLECT THE COMMUNITIES. WHERE STILL OTHER. QUESTION ABOUT STEREO TYPES IN A I THINK LEADERSHIP TRAINING IS ALSO ANOTHER REALLY EFFECTIVE WAY TO. TACKLE PART OF THIS PROBLEM. AND IN THAT. CELL IN THE IN THE EXECUTIVE THE SHIP. THAT I TOOK. WITH AJ I THINK THERE WAS THE THERE WAS A COMMON. THEME AND ATTITUDE AROUND IT'S VERY SPECIFIC PARTS OF PROMOTION AND LEADERSHIP WHICH ARE. YOU KNOW AT THAT LEADERSHIP PATH WHICH YOU KNOW AROUND SALARY NEGOTIATION. ASKING FOR WHAT YOU WANT. HAVING TOP CONVERSE AS WITH YOU KNOW YOUR BOSS OR YOUR MANAGER UP OUT. GETTING WHAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO THRIVE. I THINK HELLO THERE WAS A- BEEN FEELING OF. OKAY HOW DO WE DO THIS WE MAY BE HE- OR TO DO IT AND IT MAKES AGAIN HER NAME. A LOT OF THIS. THE CULTURAL AND ACTUALLY TIE. BUT WORKS. GATHER CAN WE PUT THIS SO MUCH OF ANYTHING WE KNOW WE CAN. AND ROTH BY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO THEN FEEL MORE CONFIDENT WHEN PUT IN THAT SITUATION THAT FEELS REALLY COUNTER INTUITIVE. WE WERE RAISED. AND MAYBE ONE FINAL QUESTION OF. SO WHERE IN THE PAN WAS IT YOU CAN TELL US WHETHER WE'RE NEWSMAKERS OR NOT GENERAL POLICY WE HAVE OTHER PEOPLE ACTUALLY WE TED JUST ENTERTAINING PANEL SOMETHING PEOPLE LIKE COVER THAT YOU KNOW THE NEWSMAKERS WE HAVE TECH COMING UP YOU KNOW WE HAD A JUDGE. IT JUDGE. RULINGS MADE IS THERE A ROLE I MEAN IS THERE A ROLE FOR TO HELP SUPPORT API JOURNALISTS AS NEWSMAKERS POTENTIAL NEWSMAKERS. YES I MEAN SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL NEWS ORGANIZATION. I DONATE BECOME A MEMBER YEAH AND SOME THIS IS ALSO JUST RAISING A PROFILES AND SOME SOLIDARITY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY RIGHT IT AND WE'RE IN A LITTLE LAND SORT OF THE- ONLINE I MEAN. BETH PERSONAL BRANDS ARE IMPORTANT IN BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY EXPRESS THAT PARTICULAR COVERAGE IS IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY. AND YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY NEWS ORGANIZATIONS ARE CHASING CLICKS AN AD DOLLARS SO SHOWING UP ACTUALLY MATTERS. AND I THINK YOU HAVE A PLATFORM TO STRESS HOW IMPORTANT JOURNALISM IS TO DEMOCRACY. AND TO COUNTERACT MAYBE OTHER NARRATIVES THAT ARE HAPPENING AROUND JOURNALISM. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU ALL CAN HELP TO AMPLIFY AS FAR AS THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THIS INDUSTRY. LIVE FOLKS CAN DO ABOUT IT. AND HOW THEY CAN TO PAY I THINK DODD A LOT OF. ARE GETTING MORE AUDIENCE AND PICK AN AUDIENCE FOCUSED. AND GETTING PHONE REALLY PARTICIPATE. OF THE JOURNALISM. THANKS A LOT FOR OTHER INDEPENDENT EVENTS. WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MY RESERVATION THANK YOU. HEY SORRY NEXT PANEL. IS ON TECH AND WE HAVE.

OF THE SITE THE BAY AREA'S POSSIBLY 35% THE BAY IS ASIAN AMERICAN. RIGHT BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTORS WE REPRESENT FORTY SEVEN PERCENT. AND AT THE LEADERSHIP LEVEL IT'S ONLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. SO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY WORK TO BE DONE. AND WHILE BUT- I DO NEED TO HAVE A PLETHORA OF ADDITIONAL THAT'S TO. THE STORY PAN PICTURE. WHAT I WANT TO HUMANIZE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE STORY. SO THERE WILL COME IS A VERY LOW. COMPANY WHAT. THE PAST. MY PRE. PLEASE NOTE THAT. AND I ROSE UP YOU KNOW SENIOR DIRECTOR AND I WAS BUILDING CLIENT SERVICES ON HIS BOOK. AND SERVICE DELIVERY IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT BUSINESS UNITS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I DID WAS I HAD TO AS I WAS BUILDING HIRE PEOPLE. ONLY CAME TO MY ATTENTION THAT I WAS ACTUALLY FLY BY HR FOR MY HIGH IMPACT IS. BECAUSE I WAS HIRING TOO MANY ASIAN AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA. I WAS HAVING TOO MANY ASIAN OUT. DIDN'T CARE THAT. EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT I HIRED IN OUR PHOENIX OFFICE EVERY. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WAS WHITE. A 100% OF MY HIRING IN PHOENIX WAS WHITE. BUT THEN I WAS FLAGGED FOR HIRING ASIAN AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA THE BAY AREA. I BUILD ANOTHER BUSINESS UNIT IN THIS. AND AT EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT THAT WAS IN THIS BUSINESS UNIT A 100% OF THE PEOPLE WENT TO STANFORD. I WAS A CAL VERY VERY PROUD OF THAT THAT I BUILD. OKAY I GET FLAGGED FOR HIRING PEOPLE THAT ALL WENT TO STANFORD FOR SPECIFIC NEW STEALTH TIGER TEAM NO BUT I GOT FLAGGED FOR HIRING ASIAN AMERICANS A CLIENT SERVICES OUT OF A CALIFORNIA OFFICE THAT IS CRAZY THAT IS ABSURD AND THAT TYPE OF INTIMIDATION AND HAVING TO LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER AND HOW TO IN AND HAVING TO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT WOW IS DOES EVERYBODY HAVE OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED OR A SORRY ABOUT THIRTEEN. HUNDRED SAT SCORE WITH. THIS UP IN ANYWAY BUT WHICH WAY BUT WHAT THEY CHOSE TO FOCUS ON WAS THAT. SO I DECIDE TO LEAVE THE COMPANY. AND IT BECAME C. OF THAT TRIP. AND IN THE FIRST MONTH I DECIDED THAT I WAS GONNA HAVE EVERYBODY FROM ALL OF THE COUNTRY COME INTO MIKE MY COME DOWN THE C. E. O. EVERYBODY'S. NOW THOSE WHO YEMEN I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT I COULD CLIMB UP THE RANKS I DON'T NEED TO ACTUALLY I'M AT THE TOP OF THE RINGS. SO THIS IS GREAT. SO I ALLEN ALL HANDS MEETING AND I HAD EVERYBODY FLY IN AND I HAD MY HEAD OF ENGINEERING OREGON PORTLAND OREGON WHO CAME AND- ONLY HAD NEVER LOOK AT MY LINK IN. AFTER MONTHS OKAY BECAUSE HE'S NOT JOURNEY JUST DOING A THING THAT'S FINE I RESPECT THAT HE'S DOI. SO THE- INTERACTION I. HAD WITH HIM WAS THIS OKAY SO YOU'RE ME OKAY SENATOR HANNAH. HE GOES UP TO THE CO FOUNDER HEY JOHN HOW'S IT GOING GIVE LOG. GOOD TO ME HEY I'M- AND YOUR TEDDY AS SOON AS HE SHOOK MY HAND. WHAT WHAT WHAT DOES THE ROOM HE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM THE WHOLE THANK YOU REALIZE THAT WAS AN ASIAN IMMENSE ASIAN AMERICAN CEO OF THE COMPANY. AND THAT TYPE OF RACISM OVER FROM MY OWN EMPLOYEES OF A COUPLE. OF IS STILL OCCURRING TODAY SO MY PLEA IS AND THERE'S A LOT OF SOLUTIONS MY PLEA IS. WE GOT WE GOT INVEST INTO DIVERSITY INCLUSION PROGRAMS THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WE GOT A LOOK AT HOLDING THE BIG COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE WE'VE GOT A SUPPORT FINANCIALLY WITH THE WITH COMPANIES THAT ARE MID SIZE OR SMALL CANNELLA COMPANIES THAT HAVE DIVERSITY INCLUSION PROGRAMS AND HELP FIND THOSE WE GOT A LOOK AT WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A MINORITY BUSINESS. GOING TO SURVIVE COMPANY AND WE THANKS TO SUPPORT THAT. FORTY MUST LEAD THE A. BECAUSE THEY'VE NOT CALIFORNIA WHAT'S HE'S GOING TO MONTANA. ARIZONA IT'S GONNA BE CALIFORNIA THAT LEAVES LEADS THE WAY PAVE THE WAY FOR LEADERSHIP IN IN THIS ARENA SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THIS IS A CAPSULE IMPORTANT. SO THEY. A GREAT THANK YOU C. FIVE YEAH. ALL RIGHT MY NAME IS BUFFY AND I'M DODD WHAT DATA JUDGE GO SORRY ONE A DAY THAT WE WILL TALK WITH DATA AND I JUST CAN GIVE A SAMPLE OF THE RESEARCH THAT I SEND DOES IN PARTICULAR WE TALK ABOUT THE EVIL ONE AND WHAT IT THE DATA CONTAINED AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT AND INSIGHTS. YOU CAN COME OUT YOU COME OUT WITH. SO JUST TO BEGIN TO HIS WORKS. FOR THOSE HAVEN'T SEEN AT THIS WHAT AN EO ONE WOULD LOOK. OR SERIES REPORTS THAT EVERY COMPANY OVER A HUNDRED. OVER HUNDRED EMPLOYEES HAS TO FOLLOW THE EOC EVERY YEAR. AND YOU'LL FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CHART WHICH HAS BASICALLY THE JOB CLASSIFICATIONS AND FOCUS ON TOP THREE LEVELS WHICH WERE THE WHITE COLLAR JOBS. IS EXECUTIVES MIDLEVEL MANAGERS AND PROFESSIONALS PROFESSIONALS ARE ESSENTIALLY THOSE JOBS REQUIRE A COLLEGE EDUCATION. ACROSS THE TOP. IS THE WORK FORCE BROKEN DOWN BY RACE AND GENDER. AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS FOCUS ON ONE COLUMN FOR EXAMPLE LOOKING AT ASIAN WOMEN. AND THE NUMBER THERE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT PERCENTAGES THAT I'VE CALCULATED HERE HE SEES IT AS YOU GO TO THE PIPELINE ASIAN WOMEN NUMBERS DECLINED HERS REPRESENTATION. WE ALL KNOW THAT AND THE AND SO THE DATE IS NICE BUT THAT BETTER BETTER THING YOU DO THE DATA IS STILL CALCULATION. AND LOOK AT THE FALLOUT. THROUGH THE PIPELINE. SO WE CREATED THERE'S TWO TO TWO TERMS OKAY WANT US TO LOOK AT THE FALLOUT FROM PROFESSIONAL WHICH IS INTEREST CONTRIBUTOR. TO EXECUTIVE LEVEL FOLKS WHO EXECUTIVE PARITY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT A POINT TWO SEVEN TWO TWO ONE SEVEN DODD APPOINT A NINE POINT. TEN POINT NINETY IS. POINT TWENTY FIVE. WHAT THAT MEANS IS PERCENTAGE AT THE TOP. IS ONLY 25% AT THE CENTER OF THE BOTTOM THE IWIN TRIP THAT IS SENTRY ASIAN WOMEN. ARE 75% BELOW PARITY IN TERMS OF THEIR THEIR THEIR THEIR REPRESENTATION WORKFORCE. CHEVROLET YOU CAN LOOK AT THE MANAGER PARITY YOU SEE THAT ASIAN WOMEN POINT FOUR FOUR MEANS THERE FIFTY SIX PERCENT. HELLO FORTY OR FIFTY CENT FIFTY SIX PERCENT. BOCA BATES SAID G. UNDER REPRESENTED IT'LL MANAGER. CASE OF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT AS A BASIC CONCEPT. AND THE NICE THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THEN I CAN DO NORMAL IS NORMALIZED COMPARISONS BETWEEN ALL COURTS. SO IN THIS EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY HOW EACH COHORT OF GENDER AND RACE FARE AGAINST EACH OTHER. AND ONE CAVEAT HERE IS THE NUMBERS FOR BLACK HISPANIC ARE SO LOW. THE F. B. CAREFUL THAT THE NUMBERS ARE OUR LOAN OF THEIR DID THERE'S NOT A SIGNIFICANT. THE MORE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS ARE FOR IT ASIAN MEN ASIAN WOMEN COMPARED TO WHITE MEN OR WHITE WOMEN AND YOU SEE HOW ASIAN BAND A FULL AND FAIR IN THIS EXAMPLE. SO THE POWER OF THE D. L. ONE IS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES. HOUSES SHOWS YOU EXACTLY WHAT THE GAPS ARE BETWEEN ASIAN AND WHITE PRINCIPALLY OKAY. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT FOR EXAMPLE THAT ASIAN WOMEN. BEGAN ARE THE LEAST REPRESENTED. RHONDA RELATIVE BASIS FOR EXAMPLE IN MIDDLE MANAGEMENT. THAT THAT THAT ASIAN MEN BASICALLY OUR PROPER MESSAGING PROMOTED THIS COMPANY AT LOWER RATES AND- AGAIN FOR THIS IS TRUE. AGAINST ALL BOOK UP BLACK HISPANIC. OKAY THE NICE THING ABOUT THIS THEN WHAT YOU UNDERSTAND THE COMPARE. IS IF YOU HAVE THE DATA ACROSS COMPANIES AND YOU AND WE HAVE A EOC DATA FOR NINETEEN DIFFERENT COMPANIES IN SILICON VALLEY. YOU CAN COMPARE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN DIFFERENT COMPANIES. THESE ARE THE NINETEEN COMPANIES THAT ARE THAT MAKE THEIR APPEAL IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND THE TWO THINGS I WANT TO POINT OUT IN THIS SLIDE. THERE ARE BETTER ELEMENT FIRST IS THAT IN YOU CAN SEE IN ALMOST ALL THIS IS THE TOP ONE IS. MANAGER PARITY FOR. FOR MEN. AT WHITE AND ASIAN AND THE BOTTOM IS A MAJOR PRIORITY FOR WOMEN WHITE AND ASIAN AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT. ALMOST ALL COMPANIES IN SILICON VALLEY SAMPLE. THAT WHITE MEN AND WHITE WOMEN ARE ABOVE PARITY IN MIDDLE MANAGEMENT. ALL COMPANIES IN SILICON VALLEY SAMPLE ALL ASIAN MEN AND ASIAN WOMEN ARE BELOW PARITY IN MIDDLE MANAGEMENT UNDER REPRESENT MIDDLE MANAGERS. IN THE END AND THERE AVERAGE HERE THE OTHER SILICON VALLEY ONE THIRTY SEVEN IT'S REALLY THAT THE NUMBERS THAT WERE ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER A BY THE BUT YOU RECEIVE HAMPSHIRE ON A PROJECT THEY DID THEY DID FOR THE CENTER OF INVESTING REPORTING AND REVEAL THAT LOOKED AT THE ACCURATE NUMBERS SO HOLLY. AND THAT AVERAGE SO WAS ESSENTIALLY BUT A WHITE MAN OR WHITE WOMAN. SUCH HAS A DOUBLE THE UP DOUBLE THE CHANCE OF BEING PROMOTED. AMANDA RACHEL SO THIS IS THE VALUE OF THE DATA AND ANALYSIS OF POINT OKAY I'M YOU CAN FIND AGGREGATED DATA AT THE EEOC NOT INDIVIDUAL AGGREGATED DATA AT THE IT IT BUT YOU'LL SEE WEBSITE AND IT'S EVERY YEAR BY NET FIND NATIONAL DATA. STATE AND LOCAL DATA. AND WITHIN THOSE AGGREGATIONS YOU CAN FIND IT BY SECTOR. SO FOR EXAMPLE I CAN LOOK AT CALIFORNIA. AND HERE'S THE NUMBERS FOR EXAMPLE ALL INDUSTRIES IN EACH MATCH BALL THE LARGE METROPOLITAN AREAS IN CALIFORNIA. AND A COMPUTER EXACTLY PARITY INDEX FOR EACH OF THESE. AND THE THING THAT NOTE IS THAT BY AND LARGE TO SHAPE THE CURVE IS CENTRAL ST. THAT ASIAN MAN AN ASIAN WOMEN ARE FARING LESS WELL THAN WHITE MEN AND WHITE WOMEN. IT SAYS AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT SUCCESS IS THE GENDER GAP. BUT THE UPSHOT OF THIS CHART SHOULD BE THIS. IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE GLASS CEILING YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION OF RACE AND GENDER AND IN EFFECT AND THE EFFECT OF THE INTERSECTION OF BOTH. THAT'S WHAT THIS SHOWS. SO IN SUMMARY I WANT TO SUM UP CENTRAL WHAT WE FOUND. WITH OUR RESEARCH USING IO ONES. NUMBER ONE. THAT AT LEAST THE DATA IS THE DATA IS AND WE FOCUS ON SILICON VALLEY FOR BECAUSE WE'RE HERE. WE FOUND BASICALLY THAT THAT ASIAN AND ASIAN WOMEN ARE THE LEAST LIKELY BE PROMOTED. SO FOUND BY THE WAY THAT LOOKED AT DATA NOT JUST FOR ASIANS BUT FOR BLACK HISPANICS WE ALSO SEE IS ALL THE NUMBERS OF. OF BLACKS HISPANICS HAVE INCREASED I SHOULD RATHER THAN PATIENT DECREASED SO AS A REGION WE'RE NOT DOING WELL SO THAT'S OTHER OTHER VALUE OF THE DATA SO YOU CAN LOOK. AT EVERYBODY'S REPORTS IN CONTEXT OF WHAT'S GOING ON OKAY SO THE DATA IS THERE. IT'S ONLY THE POWER FOR THE COMPANIES THAT ARE WILLING SCHOOL. AS TO THE CENTER FOR INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING. I ACTUALLY WANTED TO GET. FILED A FEED RESERVATION REQUESTS TO A LOT OF COMPANIES AND WE'RE DONE DIED THEY SUED THEM. AND GOT A REPORTS FROM BUT I THINK TEN OTHERS. SO A LOT OF PEOPLE UNWILLING TO RELEASE REPORTS. THAT LIMITS WHAT WE CAN DO IN A COMPARISON VALLEY AND THE NUMBERS IN SOME VALUE ALL THOSE AVAILABLE THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE. OUTSIDE I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY REPEAL ONE FROM REPORTER BY ANY OTHER COMPANY OUTSIDE SO VALLEY. AND IF WE COULD WE COULD DO WORK WITH AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON HOLLY WOULD WE COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON LAW FIRMS. BUT THAT'S NOT THERE. SO A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. THANK YOU. UP FIRST OF ALL NORMALLY I AM AN EXECUTIVE VISOR TO ASCEND BUT TODAY I AM HERE TO PRESENT A STATEMENT FROM MR JEFF CHIN WHO IS PRESIDENT OF A SENT THE LARGEST PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION WITH A MISSION TO EDUCATE ADVOCATE AND ENABLE PAN ASIAN BUSINESS LEADERS TO REACH EXECUTIVE LEVELS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON API FARES AND THE CALIFORNIA API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS FOR HOLDING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'M AWARE OF FOUR STATE LEGISLATORS ARE HOLDING A PUBLIC HEARING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC OF THE A. P. I. CLASS CEILING. ASIAN AMERICAN BOTH IMMIGRANT AN AMERICAN BORN. HAVE BECOME A VITAL FORCE IN THE GROWTH AND VITALITY IN CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESS CULTURAL AND CIVIC LANDSCAPE. WE'RE NOW OF HIS WHITE COLLAR WORKFORCE. AS THE MAJORITY OF SILICON VALLEY'S HIGH TECH WORK FORCE ASIAN AMERICANS ARE PROUD TO BE THE ENGINE THAT POWERS THE REGION'S INNOVATION AND ENERGY. BUT AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS A OUR CHIEF MEN'S HAVE OBSCURED THE COMMUNITY'S FRUSTRATION IN REACHING MORE LEADERSHIP ROLES ACROSS SOCIETY FROM LAW TO JOURNALISM FROM ENTERTAINMENT TO TECHNOLOGY SECTORS. ASCENDS OWN RESEARCH WHICH BUCK JUST TALKED ABOUT. USING AVAILABLE EOC DATA DEMONSTRATES THAT IN SPITE OF HI EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT LEVELS ASIAN AMERICANS ARE THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE PROMOTED TO MANAGEMENT. AND ALTHOUGH MANY POINT TO SINGULAR EXAMPLES OF ASIAN AMERICAN C. E. O.'S STEM SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS SHOWS WE HAD THE LEAST LIKELY TO REACH EXECUTIVE LEVEL CALIFORNIA. THE SAME EOC DATA ALSO ALLOWS US TO QUANTIFY MARGINAL PROGRESS FOR BLACKS AND HISPANIC POPULATION IN THE WORK FORCE AS WELL. WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WHAT POOR DATA IS AVAILABLE FORM A FEDERALLY MANDATED DATED E. E. O. ONE REPORTS REQUIRING RACE AND GENDER DETAILS BY JOB CATEGORIES. ALTHOUGH CONFIDENTIALLY SUBMITTED TO THE EEOC MANY LEADING COMPANIES ARE NOW MAKING THEIR EO ONE REPORTS AVAILABLE ON THEIR WEBSITES INCLUDING THE COMPANIES THAT USE ON BUCKS LIGHTS APPLE FACEBOOK GOOGLE AND SALES FORCE. HOWEVER 90% OF THE COMPANIES IN SILICON VALLEY DO NOT PUBLICLY DISCLOSE ITS DATA. A SON WAS FOUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WITH A FOCUS TO HELP ASIAN AMERICANS REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AND TO ADVANCE. THROUGH RESEARCH LEADERSHIP TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT AND NETWORKING ACTIVITIES THAT TARGET THE FULL CAREER SPECTRUM FROM COLLEGE STUDENTS TO MANAGEMENT TO EXECUTIVES AND BOARD DIRECTORS. IN ADDITION TO THE SAMPLE OF THE ANALYTICAL RESEARCH PRESENTED TODAY WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A NATIONAL NETWORK OF ASIAN AMERICAN CORPORATE BOARD DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVES I WORK WITH FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES TO MENTOR AND DEVELOP LEADERS. THIS EFFORT ALSO INCLUDES AN ELEVEN YEAR LONG COLLABORATION WITH STANFORD GRADUATE SCHOOL BUSINESS ON AN EXECUTIVE EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR ASIAN FOR SENIOR. WE ARE IN PROGRESS BUT ASK FOR YOUR HELP HELP TACKLE ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECTS WE HAVE SEEN WITH THE API GLASS CEILING WHICH IS THE LACK OF URGENCY AND AWARENESS IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS. IN YOUR ROLE AS THE VISIBLE AN INFLUENTIAL API LEADERS IN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW THAT YOUR WORDS AND ACTIONS WILL SPUR HIGHER LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT OR CORPORATE LEADERS. FIRST WE ASK THAT COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA FINALLY E. O. ONE READ PORTS WITH THE EEOC WITH THE EEOC SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE THOSE REPORTS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. THE EO ONE REPORT IS CRITICAL BECAUSE A PROVIDE DATA IN INSIGHTS INTO DEMOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION BY GENDER RACE AND JOB CATEGORIES AND CAN HELP IDENTIFY REPRESENTATION. AND ADVANCEMENT ISSUES FOR EACH IDENTIFY COHORT AGAIN BY GENDER RACE IN ORGANIZATIONAL LEVELS. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE WITH FACILITATE COMPARISONS ACROSS COMPANIES AND INDUSTRIES OVER TIME. WE OFFER A LETTER WHICH IS AND YOUR ORANGE PACKET SUPPORTING THIS POSITION THIS LETTER IS COSIGNED BY THE MONTE J. TO WEST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER PUBLIC AFFAIRS INDIA'S BORA AND THE ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE. IN ADDITION WE ASK FOR YOUR HELP IN ORGANIZING A STATEWIDE SUMMIT ON THE API GLASS CEILING TO EXPAND THE DISCUSSION IN THIS HEARING A SUMMIT TO ENGAGE MAJOR C. E. O.'S WITH API LEADERS AND FINALLY FOCUS THE DIVERSITY SPOTLIGHT. ON THE NEGLECTED PROBLEM OF THE ASIAN API COMMUNITY. A SON WOULD BE HAPPY TO HELP YOU IN LEADING THAT EFFORT. THESE MEASURES ARE JUST THE FIRST STEP SENATE DRESSING THE API CLASS CEILING. WE HAVE NO ILLUSIONS THAT THERE IS A QUICK FIX AS THE MULTI DECADE STRUGGLE FOR GENDER EQUALITY HAS DEMONSTRATED. NEVER THE LESS WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH PUBLIC DISCLOSURE WILL ENCOURAGE ALL COMPANIES TO MORE CLOSELY EXAMINE THE PROGRESS MADE BY THEIR DIVERSITY PROGRAM. IT WOULD HASTEN PROGRESS TO A FAIR AND MORE EQUITABLE WORKPLACE. WE ASSERT THAT INCREASE TRANSPARENCY IS NOT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THROUGH THE RELEASE OF THE CONFIDENTIAL E. O. ONE REPORTS. WE HOPE THAT YOU AGREE WITH THE NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY AND WOULD CONSIDER A PROPOSAL FOR ALL COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE. TO MAKE THEIR E. OLD ONE REPORTS PUBLIC. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY. THANK YOU. AND HE SAID JOHN FOR BEING IN THIS MEETING. OKAY THERE WE GO YES ALL RIGHT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONVENING THIS MEETING AND THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING MY NAME IS LINDA COUP TO COLIN I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CEO FELIPE LEADERSHIP EDUCATION FOR ASIAN PACIFICS WE ARE NOW A NEARLY FORTY YEAR OLD ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON GROWING AND DEVELOPING AND ON CAPULET OR FROM WITHIN THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES. ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE ARE BASED IN LOS ANGELES AND ACTUALLY SENATOR CHOW YOU'RE MY DAD'S DISTRICTS SO YOU'RE HIS SENATOR. I THOUGHT I JUST MENTION THAT. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING AS LOW ALONG WITH MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO RAISE THE PROFILE OF ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS INTO LEADERSHIP ROLES WE BELIEVE THAT TO BE ABLE TO IN. A SICKLY ENACT CHANGE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED OUR PRESENCE OUT THESE TABLES WHERE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE NOT ONLY JUST PRESENCE BUT ALSO HAVING OUR VOICES HEARD. I'M ALSO HERE AS THE CHAIR OF THE ALLIANCE FOR DIVERSITY WHICH IS A COALITION OR PARTNERSHIP OF FOR LEADERSHIP ORGANIZATIONS CATALYST WHICH IS A GLOBAL WOMEN'S ORGANIZATION OUR E. L. C. WHICH IS THE EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL THEY OR THE ALL FOR MOST ORGANIZATION FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS. HI SIR WHICH IS THE HISPANIC ASSOCIATION FOR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IS A COALITION OF TWELVE DIFFERENT NATIONAL HISPANIC ORGANIZATIONS AND OF COURSE LEAVE AND OUR FOCUS IS PATRICIA LEE ON ADVOCATING FOR GREATER DIVERSITY ON CORPORATE BOARDS WHAT I'M BRINGING TODAY HERE IS A PERSPECTIVE ON THE NEED FOR GREATER DIVERSITY IN REPRESENTATIONAL CORPORATE BOARDS. AND ALSO TALK A BIT ABOUT ON. WHAT. THEY SCHIRMER CANS ARE ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED IN THESE PLACES. MENTIONING AB D. BECAUSE WE'RE BEST KNOWN FOR OUR MISSING PIECES REPORT THE BOARD DIVERSITY SENSES OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES ON FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED CORPORATE BOARDS WHICH WE'VE BEEN PRODUCING SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR. AND I BELIEVE THAT I BILL I REALLY BELIEVE IN THE SCENE. WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS DONE. AND LIKE THE A SENATE REPORT THAT WAS AUTHORED BY BUCK G. ANTONY'S PACK THE MISSING PIECES REPORT IS MEANT TO SHINE A SPOTLIGHT. ON FAX AND THE FACT BASED REALITY ABOARD SENSES NUMBER AND IN THE PROCESS SPUR GREATER AWARENESS AN OPTION FOR INCREASED INCLUSION OF DIVERSE DIRECTORS ON CORPORATE BOARDS. WHAT MORE SPECIALLY I BELIEVE THAT USING DATA THAT WE PRODUCE FOR REPORTS LIKE THIS ALSO DEBUNKS THE MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE OVER REPRESENTATION OF ASIAN AMERICANS ON CORPORATE BOARDS. UNFORTUNATELY EVEN IN SPACES THAT YOU WOULD THINK PEOPLE NO. DON'T ALWAYS REALLY UNDERSTAND THE TRUE NUMBERS AND OFTEN TIMES A STUDENT THAT ASIANS ARE MUCH BETTER REPRESENTED THEN WHEN WE REALLY ARE AND I WILL SAY THAT IT'S BEEN TO MY SHOCK FORTUNATELY AND I'M NO LONGER SHOCKED. THAT IN THE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION SPACE WHO I FEEL SHOULD KNOW BETTER DON'T OFTEN KNOW BETTER AND THEY'RE OFTEN TIMES WHEN TWEET THE SAME IT ASSISTS ANYONE ELSE'S. WE'LL SHARE THAT IN THE NUMBERS THAT ARE GONNA SPEAK ABOUT THERE ARE INDICATORS FOR OPTIMISM FOR THIS COMMUNITY OUR COMMUNITY THE ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. BUT I WILL SAY THAT ADVANCEMENT IS SLOW AND CORPORATE BOARDS ARE NOT STILL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BROAD DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSFORMATIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY. QUEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE SAW THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AVAILABLE CORPORATE BOARD SEATS GROW LARGER BY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEATS SO IN AN ANALOGY I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE PIE HAS GROWN SLIGHTLY LARGER. AND INSTEAD OF JUST GETTING A SLIVER NOW WE GET MORE OF A SLICE IN TERMS OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES. BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT GROWTH IS BEING LED BY FORTUNE ONE HUNDRED COMPANIES. AND YET ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE SPECIFICALLY I'LL JUST SAY THIS ASIAN AMERICANS GREW FASTEST IN TERMS OF BOARD SEATS ON THE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES LIST. AGAIN AS I MENTIONED UNDER REPRESENTATION STILL ISSUE BUT HERE ARE SOME CONTEXT FOR SMALL WHAT I'M GONNA SHARE ON FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED BOARDS. EIGHT TEN AMERICAN WOMAN LET THE GAME. GROWTH RATE OF THIRTY EIGHT POINT 6% SUCH A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE RIGHT THIRTY EIGHT POINT SIX PERCENT. IT'S ONLY SEVENTEEN SEATS. ON THE FORTUNE ONE HUNDRED ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN GAINED THIRTY POINT 8% IN TERMS OF TOTAL BOARD SEATS GROWN. IT WAS ONLY FOUR SEATS. SO WHAT ARE WHY I'M SAYING THIS IS THAT THE PERCENTAGES SAY ONE THING BUT THE ACTUAL WRONG NUMBER SAY SOMETHING ELSE AND OUR NUMBERS AS ASIAN AMERICANS WHEN OUR NUMBERS ARE SO LOW TO BEGIN WITH ANY GROWTH IS GOING TO SEEM LIKE WOW A LOT OF GROWTH BUT IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL RUN NUMBERS IT'S REALLY NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE. I WANT TO JUST ALSO MENTION IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE DATA THAT WE SHOW IN OUR REPORT IS THE RECYCLE RATE SO HOW OFTEN ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PUT ON TWO BOARDS QUALICORP RECYCLED SO USED TO SIT ON MALTA BOARD SEATS AND OF COURSE MINORITY BOARD SEATS OFTEN TIMES ARE. AT A HIGHER RATE BUT INTERESTINGLY RIGHT NOW EIGHT AMERICANS OF THE LOS RECYCLE RATES ON BOTH THE FORTUNE ONE HUNDRED FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED BOARDS BUT AND WE'RE STILL. I ALSO WANT TO JUST TWO ONE THING AND THE DATE AROUND BOARDS THIRTY FIVE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED PLEASE TWENTY EIGHT CAD LEÓN ONE DIRECTOR THAT WAS. EATEN AFRICAN AMERICAN HISPANIC. DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS HOWEVER I WANT TO MENTION THAT. FOR THE TECH AND ENTERTAINMENT SECTORS IF WE LOOK AT THE THIRTY FIVE COMPANIES THERE ONLY TO TECH COMPANIES THAT HAD BROAD DIVERSITY. H. P. N. H. P. ENTERPRISES. AND THERE ARE ONLY TWO ENTERTAINMENT COMPANIES THAT HAVE THE BROADEST DIVERSITIES COMCAST NBCUNIVERSAL AND WALT DISNEY. THAT WAS IT NOT SURPRISING GIVEN THE DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN NO LAW FIRMS NO NO NEWSPAPERS NO BIG SURPRISE RIGHT. SO I THOUGHT I JUST MENTIONED THAT THAT THERE'S SOME BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE I LASTLY I WANT TO JUST MENTION IN TERMS OF THE CORPORATE BOARD REPORT I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT FOR THE SAKE OF OUR- THE USE OF THE WORDS ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS. I WANT TO JUST NOTE THAT THERE IS A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF NATIVE HAWAIIANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS ON CORPORATE BOARDS AND SO FOR THE RECORD I WANTED TO JUST STATE THAT BECAUSE I THINK OFTEN TIMES. I THINK FROM AN ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE WE'RE FIGHTING FOR RECOGNITION I THINK TOO OFTEN WERE IN SPACES WERE WERE COMPLETELY ERASED AND OVERLOOKED. AND I THINK THE SAME OUR IS BEING DONE TO NATIVE HAWAIIANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS. I DO WANT TO JUST SAY THAT DIVERSITY DOES WORK AND IT MATTERS BUT I THINK. IT TAKES SUPPORTERS. POLICY MAKERS LIKE YOU ADVOCATES LIKE ALL OF US HERE. TO STAY AWARE AND TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T GET COMPLACENT AND THAT. WITH THE DATA THAT WE GAIN WE GET A BETTER LEYVA LOUD BUT THERE'S ACTIONS THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE TAKEN. SO FROM A POLICYMAKER PERSPECTIVE I WILL RECOMMEND THE STEPS ONE. I APPRECIATE AND I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE RAISING THESE ISSUES. I THINK IN ABLE TO EDUCATE PEOPLE MORE BROADLY IT'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S CONTINUE. TO BE. S. MISPERCEPTION ABOUT OUR OVER REPRESENTATION. I THINK CONTINUING TO ASK. THE QUESTIONS WHETHER IT'S M. PRIDE OR ISN'T. ALL THE COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA IS IMPORTANT AS WELL TOO BECAUSE WHAT IT LIKE WHAT WE SHARED BY THE HONORABLE JUDGE WHEN WE ASK THESE QUESTIONS. PEOPLE START TO TAKE NOTICE NOT ONLY FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CHALLENGE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM BECAUSE I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A LOT OF THAT AS WE HEARD FROM. OUR FRIENDS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT AND JOURNALISM SECTORS I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT IN IN TERMS OF THESE KIND OF AREAS I THINK THERE'S ALSO OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO WORK WITH OUR CONGRESSIONAL. CATION CONTINUE. URGED THEM TO ALSO ASK QUESTIONS AND RAISE THE ISSUES BECAUSE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE IN JUNE AND LET ME TELL YOU. QUESTIONS WERE BEING ASKED ABOUT EVERY SINGLE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP EXCEPT FOR US. JUST BY THE FACT THAT I WAS THERE I FELT THAT AT LEAST THEN WE HAD SOME ATTENTION BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I WASN'T THERE THERE WAS NOT ONE ASIAN AMERICAN OR PACIFIC ISLANDER MEMBER ON THAT HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE. ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR COMMUNITIES THEY WERE ASKING ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE BUT WE WERE COMPLETELY INVISIBLE AND A RAISED AGAIN. I WANT TO ALSO SAY THAT FROM A COMPANY'S PERSPECTIVE AND I KNOW WE HAVE SOME COMPANIES IN HERE BUT I ALSO WANT ENCOURAGE THIS AS FOOD FOR THOUGHT FOR. FOR US THE POLICY MAKERS I THINK WE ASKING OR PLEASE WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO ENCOURAGE THEIR LEADERS TO SEEK OUT ASIAN AMERICA AT AND PLEASE. BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF ASIAN AMERICANS NO THAT'S SAUCE DON'T KNOW WELL THE WRITTEN RULES BUT SOMETIMES WE NEED SOMEBODY TO REACH OUT TO US I KNOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO THE SAME AND OFTEN TIMES WE ARE BUT WE MAY NOT BE DOING IT IN THE RIGHT WAY. WE MAY GIVE UP TOO EASILY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING THE KIND OF ENCOURAGEMENT THAT WE NEED I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO BE ASKING COMPANIES ARE YOU URGING ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER TEAM TO SCALP. YEAH TO HELP POUND TO REGION AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS IN THERE COME. ARE THEY DOING THAT BECAUSE. I CAN TELL YOU A LOT OF ASIAN AMERICANS. BEEN KNOW WHAT'S. BEFORE AND I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT SELF. SELF SERVING ON MY PART BUT AS A WHAT I'LL CALL A LEADERSHIP AGNOSTIC ORGANIZATIONS WE WORK FROM THE CLASSROOM TO THE BOARD ROOM ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS IN LIFE STAGES. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AND SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. BECAUSE A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS DON'T REALIZE WHAT THEY NEED TO DO I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ANGST IN TERMS OF BEING. BEING ABLE TO HONOR OUR CULTURAL HERITAGE. AND ALSO NOT BE THE STEREO TYPE AND BEING ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THAT IS IMPORTANT AND IT'S- HELPFUL WHEN WE COULD DO IT WITH THE HELP OF OTHERS WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THAT SAME ROAD. AND THEN LASTLY I THINK THE ROONEY RULE AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED YOU KNOW USING THAT AS A AS A REQUIREMENT TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS GREATER DIVERSITY. SO BUT THAT. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON HI MY NAME IS ALLISON SCOTT AND I AND THE CHIEF RESEARCH OFFICER THE KEEPER CENTER WERE BASED IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA AND THE KEEPER CENTERS FOCUSED ON INCREASING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION ACROSS THE TECHNOLOGY GO SYSTEM FROM K. TWELVE EDUCATION THROUGH THE TECH WORK FORCE AND INTO ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN VENTURE CAPITAL SO THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE TODAY TO MAKE A FEW REMARKS SO OUR RESEARCH AT THE KEEPER CENTER EXAMINES LANDSCAPE DATA AND BARRIERS FACING DIVERSE GROUP SPECIFICALLY UNDER REPRESENTED. PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN ACROSS THE TECH ECOSYSTEM AND SO WHAT MY COMMENTS TODAY ARE GOING TO CENTER AROUND THE WHAT WE FOUND IN IN SOME OF THE LANDSCAPE DATA WHICH IS THAT THE PICTURE FOR ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER INTACT IS BOTH COMPLEX SOME OF THE DATA THAT'S ALREADY BEEN REVEALED I'M IN IN WAYS IT'S COMPLETE AS WE HAVE A LACK OF DISAGGREGATED DATA IN TRANSPARENCY OF DATA ON SPECIFIC SUBGROUPS AND THAT REALLY I THINK CAMPERS. OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE TRENDS AND TO MAKE AND THIS ONE'S ABOUT INTERVENTIONS SO JUST TO START OFF IN CASE OF EDUCATION YOU MIGHT THE ASIANS DO OVER OPEN IN COMPUTERS THE DUCATION. BUT NOT THE FULL STORY. THE FACT I DID THE WE NOW HAVE DIFFERENT. THE VIETNAMESE STUDENTS ARE SIMONE STUDENTS VERSUS CHINESE AND KOREAN STUDENTS WE ALSO FOUND THAT LOW INCOME STUDENTS ARE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION AND THEN OF THE ASIAN STUDENTS WHO ARE TAKING COMPUTER SCIENCE 70% ARE MALE SO GOING BACK TO BUCKS POINT THERE IS. WE MUST PAY ATTENTION TO BOTH INTERSECTION OF REASONS UNDER I'M IN THE TECH WORK FORCE JUST TO REITERATE WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID THANKS TO THE GROUND BREAKING RESEARCH BY ASCENDS FOUNDATION AND ALSO US AND DO JEFF RING CARED JAN AT REVEAL NEWS. WE KNOW THAT THE ADVANCEMENT OF ASIAN AMERICANS IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN TECH IN SILICON VALLEY ASIAN ASIANS MAKE UP ABOUT 30% OF ALL TECH EMPLOYEES BUT THE REPRESENTATION DECREASES SIGNIFICANTLY OUT THAT BOTH THE MANAGERIAL AND EXECUTIVE LEVEL WHICH WE JUST SAW FROM EO ONE. A REPORT EXAMPLE I'M AND AGAIN DATA OR WORK FOR ASIAN WOMEN AND ASIAN WOMEN ACTUALLY C. N. N. OUT COMPLETELY OPPOSITE TREND FROM WHITE WOMEN SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO POINT OUT. AS WE HEAR A LOT OF TALK ABOUT OUR DIVERSITY IN TECH. WE ALSO A STUDY IN THE SIXTEEN REVERSED. WHICH BUT INCLUDE WITH AN- S. AN OVERT BIAS RIPPING. OFF MAN THIRD TYPING TO BEING PASSED OVER FOR PROMOTION WERE EXPERIENCES THAT FOLKS WHO WENT THERE IN THE DOOR IN TECH COMPANIES. WERE THAN DRIVING THEM OUT SO I THINK THAT ANOTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE DATA IS. WHO'S BEING PASSED OVER FOR PROMOTION AND STAYING OUT OF A LOWER LEVEL AND WHOSE ACTUALLY LEAVING I THINK TED IS EXAMPLE OF LEAVING TO GO START A COMPANY. SO IN ADDITION TO BIAS IN HIRING PROMOTION I'M JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT INCLUSION IS REALLY CRITICAL. AND THEN WE ALSO SEE THE GLASS CEILING FOR. ASIAN WOMEN SPECIFICALLY EXTENDING INTO ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND VENTURE CAPITAL. AND THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE DON'T HAVE A TON OF DATA BUT ASIANS AS A WHOLE COMPRISE JUST 12% OF ALL START UP FOUNDERS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE MUCH LARGER. PROPORTION OF THE TECH WORK FORCE. AND WE DID A SMALL STUDY OF ABOUT FIFTY FEMALE TECH FOUNDERS AND FOUND THAT. SORRY FIFTY FEMALE TECH FOUNDERS AND FOUND THAT. EAST SOUTHEAST AND SOUTH ASIAN X. IT WOMEN EXPERIENCE STEREOTYPES ABOUT RACE UNWELCOME COMMENTS ABOUT LANGUAGE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. ETCETERA DURING THE PROCESS OF PITCHING THEIR COMPANIES IDEAS. AND THAT BEN US A FAX DISPARITIES IN IN CAPITAL THAT COULD BE INVESTED IN THEIR COMPANIES. AND THEN IN VENTURE CAPITAL ASIAN MEN ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE INVESTORS THAN ASIAN WOMEN. SO IN CONCLUSION I WE KNOW ASIAN POPULATIONS ARE THE FASTEST GROWING IN THE U. S. AND ALSO. RECENT RESEARCH FROM THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER SO THAT ANY QUALITY WITHIN THE ASIAN COMMUNITY IS GROWING MOST RAPIDLY THAN ANY OTHER SUB GROUP WHICH IS. A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE TO POINT OUT. AND SO AS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO PLAY. AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR ECONOMY AND ESPECIALLY OUR ECONOMY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I HAVE THREE QUICK RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE PARTICIPATION AND SUCCESS. OF API'S ONE IS REALLY ARTICULATING THE NEED FOR US AGGREGATED DATA COLLECTION. IN C. AND REPORTING SO DE SEGREGATION AT. THE STATE LEVEL IN EDUCATION DATA AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. I'M NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THAT THE WORK FORCE LEVEL WITH THE EEOC DATA AND ALSO WITH THE COMPANY DIVERSE REPORTS. AND THEN. SPECIFIC THIS IS THE RESEARCH ON. ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER POPULATIONS THAT ARE MOST UNDERSERVED AND USING THAT INFORMATION TO HELP DRIVE INTERVENTIONS. AND THEN SECONDLY COMPUTER SCIENCE ACCESS AND EQUITY IN K. TWELVE AND AGAIN FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON WHAT WHO ARE THE POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING SERVED. WITH A FOCUS ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND GIRLS. AND THEN FINALLY INCREASING UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXPERIENCES THAT ARE AT THE INTERSECTION OF RACE AND GENDER AFFECTING ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER WOMEN AND THEN TARGETING INTERVENTIONS TOWARDS A SOLUTION. SO WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO JUST THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY GIVE SOME REMARKS. THANK YOU AND FINALLY. I'LL JUST DO A QUICK THANK YOU OKAY SAYING THEY WERE RUNNING OUT OF TIME SO I AM THE CEO OF WATER MARK AND WATER MARK IS THE LARGEST WOMEN'S ORGANIZATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA M. AS WAS MENTIONED IN MY BIO WE FOCUS ON DEVELOPMENT OF WOMEN AND WE ALSO FOCUS ON THE INTERSECTION ALLERGY ISSUES. WOMEN FACE. SO I'D LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AN EXAMPLE SO WE WERE SORT OF BOOK ENDING WITH TED AND I IN TERMS OF A OF A PERSONAL EXAMPLE AND THIS IS IN REFERENCE TO WHAT I SAW WHEN I WAS CHIEF IN MY TIME AS CHIEF DIVERSITY OFFICER AT CISCO. AND I THINK THIS WILL REINFORCE SOME OF THE REQUESTS THAT WERE MADE. SO WHAT HAPPENED WHAT I NOTICED DURING MY TENURE AS CHIEF DIVERSITY OFFICER IS IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES AND CHALLENGES FOR BLACK AND LATINO X. POPULATIONS IT'S A RECRUITMENT ISSUE AND SO WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU KNOW IT'S A RECRUITMENT ISSUE BECAUSE YOU HAVE MINISCULE POPULATIONS YOU CAN RECRUIT AT ANY LEVEL WHICH MEANS YOU CAN RECRUIT A V. P. N. S. VP OR AN EXECUTIVE. THAT HAS A HIGHER BANG FOR YOUR BUCK THEN IF YOUR CREW A FIRST LEVEL PERSON YOU KNOW AT. AN AN ENTRY LEVEL ENGINEER. WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THERE REALLY THE PERCEPTION AS HAS BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT WAS THAT THERE WAS AN OVER SUBSCRIPTION OR CERTAINLY ADEQUATE POPULATION IN AT THE ASIAN PACIFIC POPULATION AND SO I WAS APPROACHED BY BACH IN ONE OF HIS COLLEAGUES AND DENISE AND ACTUALLY A GROUP OF TWELVE. ASIAN LEADERS AT AT CISCO WHO SAID WE THINK THAT THIS HAS TO BE RAISED TO OUR CEO JOHN CHAMBERS AT THE TIME. SO WE ARRANGED A MEETING WITH JOHN AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A VERY QUICK MEETING JOHN ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE A VERY QUICK MEETING AND THOUGHT WE'RE GONNA CELEBRATE HOW WELL HE WAS DOING. BECAUSE HE HAD TO SENIOR V. P.'S WHO WERE ASIAN AND HE WAS IMMEDIATELY START OFF WITH ALL YOU'RE GOING TO CONGRATULATE ME ABOUT PAN COLLAGEN SO IN WE'RE LIKE. TIME OUT NO AND I THINK IT WAS BUT IMMEDIATELY JUMPED IN AND INTO THE FRAY AND SAID WAIT A MINUTE JOHN WE'RE HERE TO TELL YOU EXACTLY THE REAL STORY AND SO. WHILE WE SHARED WITH HIM THE ACTUAL DATA AROUND IT'S NOT A REPRESENTATION ISSUE AND IN FACT YOU'RE COUNTING ON THE ASIAN POPULATION TO SHORE UP OR NUMBERS OUR OUR AGGREGATE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. OUR ASIAN POPULATION DOES NOT MOVE UP THROUGH THE RANKS AND SO THE TWO YOU CALLED OUT TERRIFIC AND THE TWELVE IN THE ROOM. NICE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REPRESENTATION AND I LOVED YOUR PYRAMID. WE'RE ALL AT THE BOTTOM PREDOMINANTLY AND WHEN YOU GET TO THE TOP OF THAT PYRAMID IT'S ABYSMALLY SMALL. AND PROPORTIONATELY IN AND THAT'S WHY THE ASCEND REPORT THAT SHOWS THAT PROPORTION IT. PRESENTATION IS SO POWERFUL SO WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT MEETING AND THIS IS WHY I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STORY EVEN THOUGH IT'S A BIT DATED WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MEETING. IS WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SHORT MEETING JOHN IMMEDIATELY SAID WE NEED MORE TIME. SO HE SAID THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I NEED TO DIG INTO IT AND SO HE LISTENED AND HE HEARD THE ISSUES AND CHALLENGES THAT WERE ACTUALLY BEING FACED BY HIS LARGE HIS SECOND LARGEST PERCENT. OF HIS EMPLOYEES WERE FACING A CRITICAL ISSUE AND HE HAD NO IDEA OF IT. ONCE HE KNEW. AT W. EXTENDED MEETINGS HE SAID OKAY WE HAVE TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT AND WE HAVE TO DO SOME THINGS. SO HE PUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN TWO REALLY DENISE'S HEAVENS AND A FEW OTHERS AND SAID. COME TO US WITH COME BACK WITH SALUTE I WANT YOU TO COME BACK IN. ME AS CHIEF DIVERSITY OFFICER THE LEADERS COME BACK IN WITH SOLUTIONS AND PART OF THOSE SOLUTIONS WERE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT BUT PART OF THOSE SOLUTIONS WERE A SPONSORSHIP PROGRAM PART OF THE SOLUTIONS WERE OTHER. ELEMENTS THAT WE KNEW WE HAD TO. SHIFT IN THE CULTURE AND SO ESSENTIALLY THIS EXAMPLE. HAS BEEN PLAYED OUT FOR ME AND IN MY CONSULTING WORK THROUGH THE YEARS AND ALSO WHAT I HEAR FROM THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE LEADERS THAT PARTICIPATED WATERMARK IF YOU HAVE NO VISIBILITY TO A PROBLEM AND I THINK. ON HE SAID THIS INITIALLY USING A MEDICAL METAPHOR IF YOU DON'T KNOW THERE'S A MEDICAL ISSUE YOU CAN'T FIND A CURE. DIVERSITY PROBLEMS ARE HARD AND WE KNOW BRING THAT IS NOT OF A QUICK FIX AND IT'S NOT IN A PIT BUT THERE'S NO MAGIC PILL BUT IF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU HAVE A PROBLEM YOU CAN'T BEGIN TO ADDRESS IT. I WILL TELL YOU THE EXPERIENCE THAT WAS VERY DIFFERENT AND THAT'S ONE THAT WE SAW WITH THE HR SEE WHICH IS THE COMMUNITY THE RIGHTS COMMISSION THAT THAT SHARE IS WHAT COMPANIES ARE DOING WELL IN TERMS OF SUPPORT. BILL G. COMMUNITY AND WHAT COMPANIES ARE NOT. THE TWO PRONGED APPROACH NOT ONLY DOES THAT VISIBILITY FORCE COMPANIES TO SAY WE BETTER BE ON THAT LIST BECAUSE WE WANNA TRACKED GOOD TALENTED FOR NOT. BUT CONSUMERS OF COMPANY PRODUCTS ALSO KNOW WHO'S ON THE LIST AND WHO'S NOT SO. IF YOU WANT ME TO GO SEE A MOVIE AND I KNOW THAT'S A MOVIE THAT SUPPORTED DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION I'M GONNA GO SEE IT AND SO SHINING A LIGHT SHARING THE EOC ONE DATA. IS NOT ONLY GOING TO HELP COMPANIES. RISE TO THE OCCASION WHEN THEY KNOW THEIR DATE IS GOING TO BE PUBLIC BUT IT HELPS THE- PUBLIC AT LARGE SAY. I'M GONNA BUY THAT PRODUCT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT A CHOICE CAN YOU GO CAN YOU SUPPORT JUNIPER OR CISCO OR THE NEXT COMPANY ON THE BLOCK WILL I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY THAT SUPPORTS. DIVERSITY AND MY POPULATION AND SO I THINK IT'S CRITICAL FOR SO MANY REASONS AND SO. I WOULD SAY THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO SUPPORT ELEVATION AND GREATER INCLUSION AND IT AND IT ABSOLUTELY WORKS WE SAW THAT THE- SHIFT IN AND I AGREE WITH WITH LINDA WE NEED YOU MORE ON BOARDS. BUT WE'VE SEEN A CHANGE AND BOARDS WE HAVE NOT SEEN A CHANGE IN CORPORATE LEADERSHIP. AND SO THE MANDATE AND THE VISIBILITY OF BOARD REPRESENTATION HAS HELPED. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT SAME GROWTH IN LEADERSHIP AND COMPANIES AND THIS WOULD HELP TO THAT AND HELPED DRIVE IT SO I'LL I'LL CLOSE WITH THAT AND SAY THANK YOU AGAIN. FOR RAISING THIS TO ALL OF US AND RAISING THE VISIBILITY OKAY WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU EVERYONE QUESTIONS ULTRASOUND OUT SEVERAL. JOHN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD OF QUITE A FEW. A GOOD SUGGESTIONS. I HAVE A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UP SO IF I MAY I LIKE TO START WITH BUCK AND I THINK OF ALL THE TECH COMPANIES THAT HEALTH DECIDED TO. PUBLISH OR DISCLOSE IT TO C. ONE REPORT I HAVE WE SEEN IT AN IMPROVEMENT WHATSOEVER IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER HIRING. AT THE HIGHER UP LEVELS YOU KNOW. DO WE HAVE ANY STATISTICS SHOWING THAT AT ALL. SO A PRELIMINARY. TO CALL HIS FIRST COMMENT IS THAT SO WE TRACKED THEY ACTUALLY THE REPORT. WE TRY EOC DATA FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN WHAT YOU SEE WITH REGARD TO ASIAN AMERICANS IS THAT. OF THEY'RE NOW OF THE NUMBERS TO MAKE AMERICA THAT REPRESENTATION OR- IN THE WORKS SAYS THREE SO THE WAY THAT AND NOW THE LARA. MY LARGE RACIAL GROUP WITH REGARD TO RELATIVE REPRESENTATION IN MIDDLE MANAGEMENT AND EXACTLY MANAGEMENT THERE'S BEEN VIRTUALLY NO CHANGE THEIR NUMBER AGAIN THE NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED BECAUSE THE JUST THE NUMBERS OF WORKERS AGREES BUT IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGE REPRESENTATION OF THAT HASN'T CHANGED SO SEVEN DID THIS AS SPEAK TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OR LACK THERE OFF OF US THE DISCLOSURE ITSELF OR OR IT DOESN'T DOESN'T DO THAT IN YOUR VIEW. IS IT THE. NO EFFECT ON LOOKS AT IT AND IT AND UNTIL WE START LOOKING AT THE DATA SURE NO ONE HAD AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I TALK TO RESEARCHERS THAT YOU'LL SEE I TALKED IT THE RICHARD I KNEW YOU WERE SEEN HAMPSHIRE AT THAT CLAIMANT NO ONE IS ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE A WHERE THE ISSUE NO THEY'VE BEEN SO FOLKS AND OTHER ISSUES KNOWN EXACTLY CRUNCH DATA THE DATA I FOUND ERRORS IN EO ONE REPORTS THAT NO ONE HAD CAUGHT BEFORE AND I'M SENATE COMPANY AND SAYS AND I'VE SAID. IS THIS RIGHT IS IT NO THAT'S WRONG SO DATE IT'S BEEN THERE BUT NORTH LOOK AT AND NOW THERE'S A THERE'S A COHORT OF RESEARCHERS INCLUDING CAME CLAIM IT AND. AND FOR POOR AND SEND. NOW THEY CAN DO SOMETHING WITH IT. GOT A QUESTION FOR LINDA I THINK YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A TERM THAT I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IT'S A RECYCLE RATE WITH RESPECT TO THE BOARD TO MAKE UP. AND CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS AND HOW THAT WORKS PLEASE YEAH SO WHAT IT TAUGHT WHAT IT SPEAKS TO IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WERE PLACED ON SCHOOL BOARD. OR ACTUALLY MAYBE VERNON JORDAN'S PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLE VERNON JORDAN SAT ON SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT OR NINE DIFFERENT BOARDS AND SO FORTH. EACH TIME HE- IS SITTING L. OCCUPYING ABOARD C. WHAT THAT'S CALLED IS HOW MANY TIMES HAS HE BEEN QUOTE UNQUOTE RECYCLED ONTO A DIFFERENT FULLER AFTER. YEAH GOT IT OKAY. FOR DOCTOR SCOTT. THE NUMBERS AGAINST ASIAN WOMEN'S IS STAGGERING. AS YOU MENTIONED. SO I'M JUST WONDERING ARE WE DOING ENOUGH TO RECRUIT THEM. YOU KNOW TO ENTER THE ARCHITECT FEEL OUR AND AT WHAT LEVEL WOULD WE- TWO AT MOST EFFECTIVE WITH A LET'S SAY YOU KNOW IT WHETHER IT'S THE COLLEGE LEVEL OR EVEN A LITTLE LOWER. YEAH I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I THINK. SO WE HAVE A PROJECT BASED ON WOMEN OF COLOR IN COMPUTING AND WE TALK ABOUT THE ENTIRE PIPELINE AND I THINK K. TWELVE IS OBVIOUSLY VERY CRITICAL AND THEN YOU SEE KIND OF A DROP OFF OVER TIME I'M FOR ALL GROUPS I'M FOR ALL. GROUPS OF WOMEN ARE WOMEN FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS I WOULD LOVE TO DIG INTO MORE OF THE DATE OF THE C. WHERE SPECIFICALLY THE DROP OFF IS FOR ASIAN WOMEN BUT GIVEN THE- GIVEN THE FACT THAT ONLY TAKING A PCS ARE. ARE WOMEN I WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE'S A SOMETHING THAT WE COULD BE DOING AND I PRE K. TWELVE EDUCATION AS WELL AND DON'T WANT TO I MEAN I THINK THIS COVERS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS UP A PIPELINE ISSUE IN THAT WE DON'T JUST FOCUS THERE AND SAY IF WE JUST FIX K. TWELVE THEN WE CAN FIX ISSUES IN THE WORKPLACE OR IN IN A- PROMOTION BUT ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'S WORTH. IT TO DO. OKAY THANK X. JUST CLICK JUST JUST IT JUST COVER SOME TURN. CHECK THE C. SILICON VALLEY FREES UP THE NUMBERS WE LOOKED AT. TWENTY SIXTY. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. 40% OF THE TECH WORKERS WERE ASIAN WOMEN. SENATE TECH WORKERS WERE WHITE WOMEN. GOT IT GOT IT THANK YOU. I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS YES IN TERMS OF SO SOME YOUR SUGGESTION SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT PERHAPS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND THIS IS A CHALLENGE FOR I THINK MANY MINORITY GROUPS IS I GUESS A LACK OF. WHAT COULD TERM SOCIAL CAPITAL NETWORKING ABILITY AND SO FORTH. AND THEN I REALIZED THAT THAT THESE TWO THINGS MAY ALSO INTERACT TO WHAT DEGREE IS IT THE LACK YOU KNOW SO YOU WERE AN ASIAN AND- WORKING ATTACK STERN ALOT OF ASIANS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT SO YOU HAVE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO THINK OF YOU TO PULL YOU UP. NOT THAT THE PERSON HAS TO BE ASIAN TO PULL YOU UP BUT YOU'RE LESS LIKELY HAVE. YOU KNOW MAYBE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS OTHER THINGS. TO WHAT DEGREE IS IT THAT THE SORT OF THE YOUR OF CONNECTIONS ARE MAINLY WITH PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN RANK AND NOT THERE FOR PEOPLE ABOVE SO YOU DON'T GET PULLED UP. VERSUS STEREOTYPES LIKE ASIANS JUST AREN'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOOD ENGINEERS ARE JUST NOT GOOD MANAGERS. AND THAT AND SO. SO I'M JUST TRY IT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THAT PARTICULAR ATTENTION ABOUT STEREOTYPES VERSES LIKE. HEY YOU KNOW WHAT. YEAH JOHNNY IS A REALLY GOOD PERSON AND BUT I'VE NEVER GOT IT I DON'T REALLY THINK OF HIM AS IT DID GOES BACK TO WHAT I SEE PEOPLE AS- I DON'T SEE THAT PERSON AS A C. L. OR AS A SENIOR MANAGER BECAUSE- THEY'RE REALLY GOOD ENGINEERING CODING BUT THEY'RE NOT SO GOOD. YEAH BUT I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW. SO I DID START. I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH THINGS. AND I HAVE DONE. INCLUSIVE LEADERSHIP TRAINING. ACROSS THE BOARD FROM THE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED SO THAT START UPS. WHAT I HEAR CONSISTENTLY IS A COMBINATION OF BOTH THINGS ONE IS. A LACK OF SPONSORSHIP FROM SENIOR PEOPLE PULLING PEOPLE UP. AND THERE ARE NOT PEOPLE LIKE ME AND I THINK IT WAS SAID BY A FEW PEOPLE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT SENIOR TEAM AND SAY THEY'RE PEOPLE LIKE ME I'M GONNA STICK IT OUT AND TOUGH IT OUT AND FIND THOSE ADVOCATES AND NETWORK IN MY OWN WAY. SO THERE IS THAT IS A LACK AND THAT IT THAT IS OF CONCERN THE SECOND THING IT IS THAT THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY ARE NOT JUST UNCONSCIOUS BIASES BUT CONSCIOUS VERY CONSCIOUS BIASES THERE ARE. THERE CONTINUE TO BE THE QUESTIONS OF WHERE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU REALLY FROM I'M FROM OHIO NO BUT WHERE YOU. FROM REALLY FROM OHIO. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS GREAT ON PEOPLE THEY DEMORALIZED PEOPLE AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS SO YOU'RE FACED WITH I DON'T SEE ANYONE LIKE ME IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT I DON'T HAVE ANYONE ADVOCATING FOR ME UNLESS THEY'RE ASSIGNED. IT'S HARDER FOR ME TO NETWORK ALL UP. AND THERE'S THE PERCEPTION THAT I DON'T HAVE THE LEADERSHIP SKILLS BECAUSE I'M I'M ESPECIALLY IF I'M OUT ON ASIAN WOMAN. I DON'T SPEAK UP ON NOT ASSERTIVE IT CETERA ETCETERA AND ALL OF THE OTHER BIASES THAT COME ALONG SO YOU'RE FIGHTING THE STEREO TYPES THE BIASES. AND YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE ROLE MODELS AT THE SAME TIME SO IT'S A SORT OF A ONE TWO PUNCH. IT IS A. ALSO HAVE SOME ANSWERS THAT QUESTION BUT I'M SCOTT IT'S UP TO THE LOW ANDY CAN IF ANYONE TO FOLLOWS UP DANCE YOU CAN REFLECT. SO OFTEN THERE'S YOU KNOW WHAT SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS ARE WE NEED TO HAVE MORE LIKE LEADERSHIP TRAINING AND SO FORTH AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT DOESN'T HAVE VALUE. BUT TO WHAT DEGREE WOULD BE. IS THE PROBLEM REALLY THAT THE PERSON HAS A LACK OF LEADERSHIP TRAINING AND SKILLS AND- AND TODAY WE PREFER C. LIKE MAYBE I GOT MORE LEADERSHIP TRAINING I'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE UP VERSUS. WELL IF THE PERSON WHO'S HIRING THE BUT THAT LEVEL. YEAH WASN'T SO DISCRIMINATORY ARE HAD PRECONCEPTIONS ABOUT WHO I WAS IS IT IS US IS THAT. THAT'S A LEADERSHIP TRAINING IS IMPORTANT BUT TO WHAT DEGREE ARE PEOPLE SEEKING LEADERSHIP TRAINING EMBEDDING IN THEMSELVES. AT A SENSE THAT THEY'RE MISSING SOMETHING THAT IS IT REALLY A LACK IN THEMSELVES BUT IS REALLY A LACK IN THE PERSON WHO AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSE THE HIRING THEM LIKE. SO WE GOT ALL THESE ARE TRAINING THEY WANT BUT IT IS ALSO KNOWN PERCEIVE THEM AS HAVING IT YEAH THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO. PREVENT THEM SO WHAT WELL I WOULD SAY IT'S TWO FOLD IT'S THE IT'S- IT'S NOT JUST DEVELOPING YOUR OWN LEADERSHIP SKILLS I THINK IT'S MORE OF AN ISSUE OF DEVELOPING LEADERSHIP SKILLS OF LEADERS OR SELECTING THE PEOPLE. ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING AT WATERMARK IS WE'RE WORKING WITH SOME COMPANIES LIKE PIPELINE EQUITY THAT SAY FOR EVERY PROMOTION WE LOOK AT THE SKILLS. AND FILTER OUT THE RACIAL INFORMATION AND THE NAME AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF AND IF YOU DON'T HIRE THE BEST QUALIFIED PERSON YOU NEED TO JUSTIFY WHAT WHY NOT. SO THAT FILTER OUT THE IF THESE. AND WE'RE HELPING COMPANIES THAT WATERMARK PARTNER TO SAY YOU NEED IS THE POOL. BECAUSE YOU. WERE P. HUMANS AND NOT GOING TO DODD BIASED. AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO THINK YOU WANT TO. A. WANTED THEIR OWN. SKILLS THAT THAT'S A NO BRAINER BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE HOLD UP OKAY WHAT I'D LIKE. JUMP IN ON THIS CONVERSATION SO. I THINK THAT THERE IT'S A IT'S A MUCH MORE COMPLICATED AND NUANCED KIND OF PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID BUT I THINK THAT FROM A LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE I THINK THERE'S- ET. SOMEONE CALL WROTE IT YOU KNOW MENTIONED THE CODE SWITCHING THAT MANY OF US WHO ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE TO DO. YOU KNOW WE CAN'T JUST WALK IN AND JUST ASSUME PEOPLE ARE JUST GONNA ACCEPT US THE WAY WE ARE IN AND WE'VE LEARNED TO DO THAT BUT I THINK SOMETIMES. IT'S THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE HAVE TO CODE SWITCH AND SOMETIMES WE GET STUCK IN THIS YOU KNOW HOW TO WHITE. HONOR QUITE M. FROM A CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE MIGHT MIGHT MY IDENTITY AND MY VALUES AND STILL BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE THIS ORGANIZATION THAT EXPECTS CERTAIN THINGS OF US. AND I THINK BEING ABLE TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THESE. I'LL CALL IT CULTURALLY A RIPPLE OF IN CULTURALLY SENSITIVE TYPE OF LEADERSHIP BALL MINT IS IT NOT THE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT ITSELF IT'S ABOUT HOW DO WE GROW OR SOLD. AND SO THAT WE CAN. THIS. HOW TO. OFTENTIMES AT TAUGHT THINGS IN A CERTAIN WAY RIGHT RESPECT ELDERS MEANS. AND DON'T SAY ANYTHING IN A MEETING BUT SOMETIMES RESPECT RESPECT YOUR YOUR BOSS MEANS YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE TEACHING. EATING CODES WHICH IN A WAY THAT ENABLES YOU TO HONOR WHO YOU ARE BUT ALSO STILL BE ABLE TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU'RE IN AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. I WILL ALSO MAKE ONE OTHER COMMENT I THINK ALSO THERE'S A CHALLENGE FOR ASIAN AMERICANS WHO ARE IN LEADERSHIP WHO DO NOT. HELP OTHERS. PULLING THEM UP BECAUSE IT'S SO SELF CONSCIOUS AND SO AFRAID OF GETTING ACCUSED OF FAVORING OH MY GOD GOD FORBID THAT THEY HAVE TO HELP ANOTHER ASIAN PERSON. THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY WILL NOT HELP OTHERS AT ALL BUT NOBODY LIKE PETTY TALKED ABOUT NOBODY QUESTIONS WHEN PEOPLE PULL UP. YOU KNOW WHEN WHITE GUYS PULL UP JUNIOR WHITE MEN. AND NOBODY EVER QUESTIONS THAT AND THAT'S ALSO AN ISSUE IN OUR COMMUNITY TO. I WOULD ALSO OFFER THAT THIS IS PART OF THE DISCUSSION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE TO HAVE WITH THE LARGER COMMUNITY. AND THIS IS THE KIND OF DISCUSSION I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE AT THE SUMMIT THAT IF WE CAN ORGANIZE IT. BECAUSE I THINK IS A MULTI PART CONVERSATION HAVING ASIANS DEVELOP THEIR OWN LEADERSHIP STYLES AND GROWING THERE YOURS IS ONE THING BUT WHEN THEY GO BACK OUTSIDE THAT LEADERSHIP TRAINING INTO THE REGULAR WORKFORCE ARE CONFRONTED WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT PERCEPTIONS ABOUT WHO THEY ARE. AND OUR OWN PERCEPTIONS ABOUT WHO THEY ARE AS WELL AND THAT THE MORE GLOBAL SOCIETY SO I THINK THIS IS A- TWO PART CONVERSATION I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE- PUBLIC PRIVATE. PARTNERSHIP ON THIS TO EXTEND ANDERSON. AND THE ISSUES ARE NOT JUST LIMITED TO BEES I. HIGHER EDUCATION. NON PROFITS WE ALL HAVE THE SAME CHALLENGES IT IS AN ACROSS THE BOARD SECTOR ISSUE. ALL RIGHT WELL I THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR A YEAR 2% AND REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE AND THAT YOUR INSIGHTS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. OKAY NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND I THINK MR IS THERE A LIST PEOPLE. SO WE HAVE A BACK MIKE FIVE PEOPLE WISH TO MAKES BRIEF REMARKS WILL ASK IF YOU CAN TRY TO KEEP YOUR MARKS TO A MINUTE. AND CERTAINLY FEEL FREE TO SUBMIT ANY. COMMENTS AS WELL TO THE COMMITTEE AS WELL SO. SO WE CAN JUST FIRST INTRODUCE YOURSELF YOUR NAME IF YOU HAVE THAT HERE FOR AN ORGANIZATION AND THEN.

ALLIANCE FOR CONTENT. THESE. ACTUALLY THE- NO WE HAVE IS VERY MUCH ALIGNED WITH LEGAL ENTERTAINMENT AS WELL AS JOURNALISM ALL EYES TED BECAUSE OF. IN ALL THESE AREAS IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE IN TRADITIONALLY UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS HAVE A MORE STRESS AND MORE PRESSURE AND FOR MORE.

DODD THIS IS A WE RAISE SOME REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES HERE. AT CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND THE API CAUCUS WILL BE THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS THAT NOT THE CHAIR THE CAUCUS BUT I'M SURE DAVID SHE WOULD. AGREE AND- AT YOU'RE NODDING YOUR HEAD SO THAT'S GOOD WE HAVE A COUPLE OF US HERE SAY. YEAH WE'RE THINKING ABOUT OKAY WELL MAYBE SOME LEGISLATION THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT DOING BUT NOT JUST LEGISLATION BECAUSE IS ALSO LARGER.
