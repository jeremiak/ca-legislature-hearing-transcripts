MASSIVE LEARNING LIST. THIS BILL

01:55:43.936 --> 01:55:44.971

CDPH DOESN'T PLACE ON SCHOOL

01:55:54.981 --> 01:55:55.648

OR SCHOOL. THESE CANGES COULD

01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:15.601
REQUIRE SCHOOLS RAMP UP TESTING

WITHOUT ANY NOTICE AND AN UNTOLD

01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:19.172
COSTS. THE COULD ALLOW SCHOOLS

01:56:19.238 --> 01:56:20.506
REDUCE TESTING PER SCHOOL WOULD

01:56:20.573 --> 01:56:22.008
HAVE ALREADY INCURRED THE COST

01:56:22.075 --> 01:56:23.943
