00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:21.264
WHILE HERS HER SUIT WAS

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:23.667
PENDING. IT WASN'T UNTIL

00:53:23.733 --> 00:53:24.234
NINETEEN FORTY FOUR THAT SHE

00:53:24.301 --> 00:53:25.302
WAS FINALLY RELEASED FROM THE

00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:27.070
CONCENTRATION CAMP AFTER THE

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:29.039

OUR ACTIONS EIGHTY YEARS AGO.

00:53:36.546 --> 00:53:38.048
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS WERE

00:53:38.114 --> 00:53:39.583
CERTAINLY COMPLICIT IN

00:53:39.649 --> 00:53:41.251
DESTROYING THE LIVES OF

THOUSANDS. OF THEIR OWN

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.220
CONSTITUENTS DURING WORLD WAR

00:53:44.287 --> 00:53:46.456
TWO. HOWEVER WITH THIS FORMAL

APOLOGY WE CAN TAKE A STEP

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:49.125
TOWARDS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE

00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:50.994
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THAT

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:53.229
TRAMPLED OVER THE CIVIL RIGHTS

TERRIBLE MISTAKES OF OUR

GRANDPARENTS- WERE INTERNED IN

00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:40.477
PLACES LIKE TULE LAKE ANOTHER

00:54:40.543 --> 00:54:42.379
INTERNMENT CAMPS- THROUGHOUT.

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:45.315
THE STATE AND WE HAVE TO

00:54:45.382 --> 00:54:48.652
REMEMBER THAT. THESE WERE

00:54:48.718 --> 00:54:51.087
AMERICANS OKAY THESE WERE

00:54:51.154 --> 00:54:54.224
PEOPLE WHO. EMIGRATED FROM

JAPAN- BUT SETTLED HERE AT

00:54:57.927 --> 00:55:00.296
ESTABLISH FARMS HERE AND MANY

00:55:00.363 --> 00:55:02.666
OF THEM MULTI GENERATIONAL AND

00:55:02.732 --> 00:55:04.167
IT AND IT DOESN'T MATTER

00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:05.502
THEY'RE A MULTI GENERATIONAL OR

00:55:05.568 --> 00:55:07.070
NOT BUT THEY HAD BECOME. SICK

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:10.607
SINCE. MADE THIS THEIR HOME AND

00:55:10.674 --> 00:55:15.845
WE SAID TO AMERICAN CITIZENS.

00:55:15.912 --> 00:55:17.213
PROPERTY AWAY FROM AND WE PUT

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.149
THEM IN CAMPS WITHOUT ANY DUE

00:55:19.215 --> 00:55:23.353
PROCESS OF LAW. WHAT WHAT THIS

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:27.457
COUNTRY DID AND THIS STATE DID

00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:29.159
NEEDS TO BE APOLOGIZE FOR A

00:55:29.225 --> 00:55:32.128
NEEDS TO BE. RECOGNIZE FOR THE

00:55:32.195 --> 00:55:34.931
ATROCITY THAT IT WAS THAT'S NOT

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:36.966
WHO WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE. AS

00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:39.869
AMERICANS. AND THE STATE DID

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:41.404
HAVE A KEY ROLE IN THAT.

00:55:41.471 --> 00:55:44.207
IRONICALLY IT WAS FRANKLIN

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:45.775
DELANO ROOSEVELT WHO SAID WE

00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:47.811
HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR

00:55:47.877 --> 00:55:52.115
ITSELF. AND YET WHEN HYSTERIA

00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:54.918
AND FEAR CAME IN ON THIS ISSUE

00:55:54.984 --> 00:55:58.121
HE GAVE IN TO IT. AND EARL

00:55:58.188 --> 00:56:02.225
WARREN YAHOO IS A ANOTHER KEY

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:04.360
ARCHITECT OF INTERNMENT GAVE

00:56:04.427 --> 00:56:08.231
INTO THAT. FEAR AND MANY

00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:09.199
POLITICIANS AS HAS BEEN POINTED

00:56:09.265 --> 00:56:11.534
OUT GAVE INTO THAT FEAR AND

00:56:11.601 --> 00:56:16.172
HYSTERIA. AND ALLOWED THAT FEAR.

00:56:16.239 --> 00:56:18.141
TO THEN TURN INTO TAKING AWAY

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.643
PEOPLE'S CIVIL RIGHTS. AND

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:21.344
CERTAINLY I THINK THAT'S

00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:22.612
SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALWAYS

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.848
THINK ABOUT- WE'VE WE HAVE

00:56:24.914 --> 00:56:26.783
TALKED ABOUT CHINESE EXCLUSION

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:29.819
VERY SIMILAR. YOU KNOW YOU

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:31.121
WOULD THINK THAT- WE WOULD HAVE

00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:33.256
LEARNED OUR LESSON BECAUSE ONLY

00:56:33.323 --> 00:56:34.390
SIX YEARS BEFORE CHINESE

00:56:34.457 --> 00:56:36.593
EXCLUSION HAD AND HYSTERIA HAD

00:56:36.659 --> 00:56:38.962
TAKEN OVER AND THOSE- POLICIES

00:56:39.028 --> 00:56:43.199
WERE PASSED AND THEN- IN THE

00:56:43.266 --> 00:56:45.769
FORTIES JAPANESE INTERNMENT SO

00:56:45.835 --> 00:56:46.770
WE DO NEED TO RECOGNIZE WHAT

00:56:46.836 --> 00:56:48.972
HAPPENS THIS BODY IN AND IT IS

00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:52.442
RELEVANT. TO TODAY- THAT WE

00:56:52.509 --> 00:56:56.346
ALLOW FEAR TO GUIDE US. WE

00:56:56.412 --> 00:56:58.148
OFTEN DO THINGS THAT UNDERMINE

00:56:58.214 --> 00:57:00.917
PEOPLE'S RIGHTS. AND I WOULD

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:03.319
SAY WHEN WE HAVE A RIGHTEOUS

00:57:03.386 --> 00:57:04.254
FEAR EVEN WE MIGHT HAVE A

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.422
RIGHTEOUS FEAR WE HAVE A RIGHT

00:57:06.489 --> 00:57:08.625
HIS FEAR OF GUN VIOLENCE. IN

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:10.360
THIS COUNTRY BUT IF WE LET THAT

00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:14.631
FEAR. LEAD US TO UNDERMINING.

00:57:14.697 --> 00:57:16.266
CITIZENS LAWFUL AND

00:57:16.332 --> 00:57:18.668
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WHEN LAW

00:57:18.735 --> 00:57:22.438
ABIDING CITIZENS. RIGHTS ARE

00:57:22.505 --> 00:57:25.809
UNDERMINED OUT OF A FEAR. OF

00:57:25.875 --> 00:57:27.644
WHAT COULD HAPPEN WE SHOULD BE

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:31.147
THINKING ABOUT THAT. CLIMATE

00:57:31.214 --> 00:57:32.582
CHANGE IS A VERY REAL ISSUE

00:57:32.649 --> 00:57:34.517
THAT MANY OF THIS BODY WANT TO

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:36.586
DO SOMETHING ABOUT. BUT WHEN WE

00:57:36.653 --> 00:57:38.188
HAVE A RIGHT WHEN WE HAVE A

00:57:38.254 --> 00:57:41.157
FEAR THAT LEADS US TO TAKE AWAY

00:57:41.224 --> 00:57:42.826
PEOPLE'S PROPERTY RIGHTS. THAT

00:57:42.892 --> 00:57:44.494
LEADS US TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S

00:57:44.561 --> 00:57:45.795
RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT

00:57:45.862 --> 00:57:48.198
HOW THEY WANT TO WORK THE CROPS

00:57:48.264 --> 00:57:51.100
THAT THEY WANT TO GROW. THE

00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:53.403
CARS THAT THEY WANT TO DRIVE.

00:57:53.469 --> 00:57:55.205
WHEN WASTE WHEN WE START SAYING

00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:56.105
WE HAVE TO TAKE AWAY YOUR

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:57.841
RIGHTS BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE TEN

00:57:57.907 --> 00:58:02.245
YEARS. AND WE USE HYSTERIA TO

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:03.346
DO THINGS TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S

00:58:03.413 --> 00:58:04.881
RIGHTS WE SHOULD BE THINKING

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:07.483
ABOUT THOSE THINGS THERE'S MANY

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:09.118
AND THERE'S MANY EXAMPLES THAT

00:58:09.185 --> 00:58:11.120
WE CAN POINT TO. IT'S ALWAYS

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:13.523
RELEVANT FOR US TO REMEMBER.

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:17.794
THAT TIME. WE DO HAVE NOTHING

00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:19.963
TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF BUT

00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:22.465
LET'S ACTUALLY LIVE UP TO THAT

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:24.300
MOTTO WHEN WE'RE MAKING POLICY

00:58:24.367 --> 00:58:27.070
LET'S NOT ALLOW FEAR. TO LEAD

00:58:27.136 --> 00:58:29.005
US TO UNDERMINING PEOPLE'S

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:31.007
RIGHTS THAT IS A LESSON. I

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:33.209
BELIEVE OF HISTORY AND

00:58:33.276 --> 00:58:36.145
HOPEFULLY WILL CONTINUE.

00:58:36.212 --> 00:58:38.448
HOPEFULLY WE WILL HAVE LEARNED

00:58:38.514 --> 00:58:40.550
THE LESSONS OF HISTORY AND I

00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:42.418
THINK IT STARTS BY SUPPORTING

00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:44.821

OUR FELLOW AMERICANS. MAY IT

00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:57.400

MISTAKES AND IN AND OF OUR OWN

00:59:12.749 --> 00:59:14.717
GOVERNMENT ITSELF TOO OFTEN WE

00:59:14.784 --> 00:59:16.753
CHOOSE TO IGNORE INCONVENIENT

00:59:16.819 --> 00:59:19.055
TRUTHS. UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:20.690
UNTIL THE PAIN HAS BEEN BORN

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:22.158
TOO LONG ONE TWO A COMMUNITIES

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:24.360
HAVE BEEN BROKEN AND SCATTERED.

00:59:24.427 --> 00:59:25.828
WE OFTEN HAVE THE TENDENCY TO

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:26.829
THINK THAT WERE PART THIS PILOT

00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:28.131
THAT WE CAN WASH OUR HANDS OF

00:59:28.197 --> 00:59:29.866

THE INTERNMENT AND SUBJUGATION

00:59:42.512 --> 00:59:43.913
OF JAPANESE AMERICANS. WE

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.416
SOMETIMES THINK THAT ORDER

APOLOGIZING THE PAIN THAT WE

THAT NEED TO BE MADE ENTIRELY

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:58.781
CLEAR. THE CRITICAL POINT OF

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.617
THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT THAT WE

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:02.785
APOLOGIZE FOR NATIONAL POLICIES

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.854

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.022
DURING WORLD WAR TWO. WE'RE NOT

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:09.191
APOLOGIZING FOR CULTURAL RACISM

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PLAYED

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:18.834
IN THIS INJUSTICE. AS MY

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:20.403
COLLEAGUE FROM GLENDALE POINTED

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:22.438

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:24.473
APOLOGIZING FOR THE WRONGS THAT

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.308
WERE COMMITTED ON THIS FLOOR.

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:27.610
THIS FLOOR WHERE I NOW NOW

01:07:27.676 --> 01:07:30.513
STAND AND WE'RE ALL OF US ALL

01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:31.947
OF ALL OF OUR DESKS ARE NOW NOW

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:35.418
SAID. HR SEVENTY SEVEN IS OUR

01:07:35.484 --> 01:07:37.753
RESOLUTION AND WE ARE

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.556
APOLOGIZING FOR WHAT WE DID. WE

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:42.658
THE LEGISLATURE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:44.994
THIS APOLOGY IS OVERDUE. BUT IS

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:47.463
NOT THE MORE DIFFICUT THING I

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.031
ASK OF YOU AND OF MYSELF.

01:07:49.098 --> 01:07:51.867
IMPORTANT AS THIS RESOLUTION IS

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:53.736
IT IS STILL JUST A RESOLUTION

01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:56.005
IT WILL MEAN NOTHING UNLESS WE

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:58.641
LEARN FROM OUR PAST MISTAKES.

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:00.042
IT WILL MEAN NOTHING UNLESS WE

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:02.211
ASK OURSELVES THE HARD QUESTION

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:04.413
THAT WE WISH OUR PREDECESSORS

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.715
HAD ASKED THEMSELVES. IN ORDER
