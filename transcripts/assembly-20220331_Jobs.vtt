00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.215
ONWARD CALIFORNIA AND WHAT WE

00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:44.482
WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH

00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:46.852
SUCCESSFULLY. THE POINT HERE IS

00:24:46.918 --> 00:24:48.753
REALLY TO CREATE A GRANT PROGRAM

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.355
FOR THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE

00:24:50.422 --> 00:24:51.790
TO HELP MANY OF THESE UNDER

00:24:51.857 --> 00:24:54.559
RESOURCED. COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE

00:24:54.626 --> 00:24:56.761
HISTORICAL GAPS. WILL TO HAVE

00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:58.930
THE- TRAINING AND SUPPORT

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:01.233
SERVICES THAT ARE NECESSARY WE

00:25:01.299 --> 00:25:03.802
HAVE TO ACTUALLY. BRIDGE THOSE

00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:05.070
GAPS IN THE DIGITAL

00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:06.238
INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH THIS

00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:08.607
GRANT PROGRAM- SIMILAR TO WHAT

00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:10.442
WE DID IN ONWARD CALIFORNIA WILL

00:25:10.508 --> 00:25:12.544
HELP US TO DO THAT. BUT I'D LIKE

00:25:12.611 --> 00:25:13.712
TO DIRECT THE WORKFORCE GAPS

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:15.947
QUESTION TO MISS CARMONA IF I

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:25.390
CAN. YES PERFECT DOT COM SO I

00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:26.858
THINK JUST TO REITERATE SOMEONE

00:25:26.925 --> 00:25:28.293
OF BLACK WITH PART OF MY

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.328
TESTIMONY BUT I THINK THERE JUST

00:25:30.395 --> 00:25:31.563
NEEDS TO BE A MUCH MORE DILIGENT

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.432
AND FOCUSED. ON STRENGTHENING

00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:35.267
TRAINING AND EDUCATIONAL

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:37.068
PROGRAMS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO

00:25:37.135 --> 00:25:38.536
UPSKILLING AND RESKILLING LET

00:25:38.603 --> 00:25:39.738
THE NOTHING SPECIFICALLY LIKE

00:25:39.804 --> 00:25:41.907
THE NOTHING OUR LABOR MARKET WE

00:25:41.973 --> 00:25:43.208
KNOW THAT THEY JUST HAPPEN

00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:44.910
DISPROPORTIONATELY BARRED FROM

00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:45.810
ACCESSING HIGHER WAGE

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:48.380
EMPLOYMENT- AND ESPECIALLY WAY

00:25:48.446 --> 00:25:50.649
IMMINENT THREAT REALLY I DO

00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:52.384
AUTOMATION OF LOW WAGE WORK SO I

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.020
THINK REALLY JUST TAX CAN'T

00:25:55.086 --> 00:25:57.022
CLOSE OUT AND JUST REALLY- YOU

00:25:57.088 --> 00:26:01.526
THINK. OF THAT EITHER. WHAT WE

00:26:01.593 --> 00:26:04.095
SHOW THEM THAT. OVER IN THE- ON

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:05.497
INDUSTRY THAT WE KNOW ARE HIGH.

00:26:05.563 --> 00:26:07.165
CORRECT THE MISSION I THE

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:09.167
AFRICAN. WE AND HOW. WHOLESALE

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:11.436
AND RETAIL TRADE ON THOSE FOR

00:26:11.503 --> 00:26:13.004
INDUSTRIES EMPLOY ABOUT TWO

00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:14.806
POINT SEVEN MILLION FOLKS I'M

00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:16.441
NOT 40% OF WHICH ARE LIKE YOU

00:26:16.508 --> 00:26:18.243
KNOW WORKERS. OR 40% OF LATINO

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.911
WORKERS WORK WITHIN YOU TO TREAT

00:26:19.978 --> 00:26:21.446
INDUSTRY SO THERE IS A REAL

00:26:21.513 --> 00:26:23.114
IMMINENT NEED ON TEN MAKE SURE

00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:24.082
THAT WE'RE DELIVERING WORKFORCE

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:26.151
DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES. AS WELL

00:26:26.217 --> 00:26:28.019
AS- FACILITATING A PATHWAY TO

00:26:28.086 --> 00:26:30.488
GET PEOPLE OUT OF THESE LOW WAGE

00:26:30.555 --> 00:26:32.524
SECTORS- ARE. ME SHE'S THAT

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:36.895
INTO- HIGHER INCOME DROPPED. I

00:26:36.962 --> 00:26:38.396
WILL NOW HAVE IT'S OKAY MADAM.

00:26:38.463 --> 00:26:40.098
MISSPELLED SPEAK TO ON WORD

00:26:40.165 --> 00:26:42.567
CALIFORNIA AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW

00:26:42.634 --> 00:26:44.970
THIS HAS WORKED ALREADY. THANK

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:46.972
YOU DR A BILL THAT. I CAN JUST

00:26:47.038 --> 00:26:48.340
QUICKLY SAY THAT WITH THE LAUNCH

00:26:48.406 --> 00:26:50.175
OF ON GRID CALIFORNIA AT THE

00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:51.109
BEGINNING AT THE BEGINNING OF

00:26:51.176 --> 00:26:52.811
THE PANDEMIC AT WHAT SET THE

00:26:52.877 --> 00:26:55.046
TOOL APART. IS THAT IT WAS NOT

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:57.015
JUST ONE JOB PLATFORM WHICH IS

00:26:57.082 --> 00:26:58.850
DEEPLY IMPORTANT BUT- NUMBER ONE

00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:00.051
IS INTEGRATED WITH SO MANY OF

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:01.252
THE STATE RESOURCES ALREADY

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:02.954
AVAILABLE AND SO EVERYTHING IS

00:27:03.021 --> 00:27:04.255
HOUSED UNDER ONE UNIT SO NOT

00:27:04.322 --> 00:27:06.057
JUST. JOB OPPORTUNITIES BUT

00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:07.659
TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AND

00:27:07.726 --> 00:27:09.160
ESSENTIAL LIVE SERVICES THINGS

00:27:09.227 --> 00:27:10.962
LIKE CRITICAL AS A CHILD CARE

00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:12.897
AND YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S FOOD

00:27:12.964 --> 00:27:14.733
AND SECURITY ISSUES. SO THEY ARE

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:16.901
NOT NEEDING TO GO TO ONE

00:27:16.968 --> 00:27:18.503
PLATFORM THEY'RE NOT A MEETING

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.472
TO GO TO MULTIPLE PLATFORMS.

00:27:20.538 --> 00:27:21.873
WELL TO PULL ME IN. AND I THINK

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.441
ON THE OUTREACH COMPONENT THAT'S

00:27:23.508 --> 00:27:25.143
ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:26.277
THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO

00:27:26.344 --> 00:27:28.246
ACTUALLY. DOUBLE DOWN ON IN THE

00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:30.448
WAY WE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO AT

00:27:30.515 --> 00:27:31.583
THE BEGINNING. OF ON WERE

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:32.851
CALIFORNIA DAYS WHERE WORKING

00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:34.886
WITH PARTNERS LIKE THE LIBRARY.

00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:35.854
COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.122
UNDERSTANDING THE COMMUNITIES

00:27:37.188 --> 00:27:38.890
THAT THEY SERVE SO THAT WE CAN

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:40.558
REACH OUT DIRECTLY TO THOSE

00:27:40.625 --> 00:27:42.827
MEMBERS THAT ACTUALLY NEED THE

00:27:42.894 --> 00:27:44.429
PLATFORM MOST. AND WHAT WAS IS

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:46.965
AYE I DO FIVE. REMEMBER THAT THE

00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:48.333
LAUNCH OF ON OR CALIFORNIA BUT

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.334
I'M NOT ACTUALLY AS FAMILIAR

00:27:49.401 --> 00:27:52.470
WITH- HOW SUCCESSFUL THAT WAS

00:27:52.537 --> 00:27:54.039
AND HOW MANY CALIFORNIANS

00:27:54.105 --> 00:27:56.808
ACTUALLY UTILIZE THE PROGRAM AND

00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:58.810
HOW MANY CALIFORNIANS ACTUALLY.

00:27:58.877 --> 00:28:00.178
GOT JOBS AS A RESULT OF THAT

00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:02.213
PROGRAM ABSOLUTELY- AND I CAN

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.049
FOLLOW UP WITH SOME REAL SOME

00:28:04.115 --> 00:28:05.350
REAL DATA POINTS ABOUT I CAN'T

00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:07.218
SAY THAT WITHIN. A FEW DAYS OF

00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:09.354
LAUNCHING THE PLATFORM OVER TWO

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:10.088
HUNDRED FIFTY CALIFORNIANS WERE

00:28:10.155 --> 00:28:12.057
USING THEIR PLATFORM USAGE AND

00:28:12.123 --> 00:28:14.426
THEN THE ACTUAL YOU KNOW SUCCESS

00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:15.693
RATE I RECOGNIZE THOSE ARE

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.095
DIFFERENT AND PART OF WHAT WE

00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:18.997
WOULD LOVE TO SEE AND THE NEXT

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:20.532
ROUND OF TOOLS. IS ACTUALLY

00:28:20.598 --> 00:28:22.167
DOING MORE OF THAT DIRECT

00:28:22.233 --> 00:28:23.101
SUPPORT SERVICE EVEN JUST THAT

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:24.569
YOU KNOW AND COMPANIES LIKE

00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:26.337
LINKEDIN CAN'T TRAP OF THE

00:28:26.404 --> 00:28:27.572
ACTUAL SUCCESS RATE OF FOLKS

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:29.040
GETTING PLACE TO JOB THAT'S NOT

00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:30.809
THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED. SO

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:32.343
THERE'S ALL KINDS OF INNOVATIVE

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.312
WAYS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED TO

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:35.647
INFUSE IN THE PLOT FORWARD. TO

00:28:35.713 --> 00:28:36.748
ACTUALLY TRACK DOWN THOSE

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:39.217
OUTCOMES AND A MORE HOLISTIC WAY

00:28:39.284 --> 00:28:41.019
ON IT GAP WELL AND I CERTAINLY

00:28:41.086 --> 00:28:43.288

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:52.697
DRIVEN ECONOMY THE ONE QUESTION

00:28:52.764 --> 00:28:55.467
I DO HAVE IS. THAT IN A WAY IF

00:28:55.533 --> 00:28:57.368
WE'RE TRYING TO REACH A GROUP OF

00:28:57.435 --> 00:28:58.703
FOLKS THAT. HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.038
TO NAVIGATE EXISTING ONLINE

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:01.439
TOOLS IS THE ANSWER ANOTHER

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:03.708
