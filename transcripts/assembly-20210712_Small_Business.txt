BOB BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS MUCH MORE TO DO THAT THERE ARE.

IT'S NOT ON. ON YEAH. MASCARA. INTRAVASCULAR A COMPLEX ON THE COVER. CAN CANYON AREA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR BRAND YOU ARE FROM THE FROM THE L. A. O. I PREPARED A HANDFUL OF SLIDES FOR THE PRESENTATION TODAY I DON'T KNOW WE'RE GONNA COME UP OVER HERE OR YES I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET THEM ON THAT SCREEN OKAY GREAT THANK YOU- SO IT'S GOING TO HELP SORT OUT THE HEARING TODAY TO JUST KIND OF PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR THE REST YOUR DISCUSSION BY OFFERING SOME OBSERVATIONS ON A HANDFUL OF KIND OF HIGH LEVEL STATISTICS THAT SHOW KIND OF- THE DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS AND BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN THE STATE OVER THE LAST. YEAR AND A HALF OR SO- AND TO JUST- KIND OF HELP YOU BOTH GET A SENSE OF HOW THE PANDEMIC IS AFFECTED BUSINESSES AND WHAT SORTS OF THINGS YOU COULD BE FOLLOWING TO TRACK THE RECOVERY ROOM AS WE MOVE FORWARD- SO GOING TO THE FIRST SLIDE- STARTING WITH JUST A COUPLE OF KIND OF HIGH LEVEL STATISTICS ON WHAT'S HAPPENED TO BUSINESS AND BUSINESS INCOME- THIS FIRST SLIDE HERE SHOWS KIND OF. THE TREND IN THE NUMBER OF TOTAL EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE AND BROKEN OUT BY THE SIZE OF THE EMPLOYER BASED ON HOW MANY EMPLOYEES THEY HAVE AND A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS HERE ONE IS THAT WE SEE THAT EMPLOYERS OF ALL SIZES- SAW HUGE DECLINES- EARLY ON IN THE IN THE PANDEMIC- ANOTHER NOTABLE AND THEN PERHAPS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING THING IS THAT WE'VE SEEN. OF THE MOST RECOVERY AMONG THE SMALLEST EMPLOYERS- AND THOSE WITH FEWER THAN TEN EMPLOYEES AT SOMETHING IN A KIND OF AN IMPORTANT NUANCE HERE TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT THIS PROBABLY DOESN'T REFLECT- BUSINESSES THAT EXISTED PRE PANDEMIC THAT HAD TO SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC COMING BACK ONLINE- MORE LIKELY THIS REFLECTS THE FACT THAT WE'VE SEEN KIND OF A HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF NEW BUSINESS FORMATION DURING THE PANDEMIC IN A LOT OF THAT HAS BEEN- FOLKS WHO STARTED BUSINESSES THAT ARE CATERING TO THE WAY THAT PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES OF ADAPTED- THEIR PERSONAL AND WORK LIVES TO- KIND OF THE NEW REALITIES THE PANDEMIC IS CREATED SO. I JUST CONVERSING SOME OF THIS RECOVERY HERE IN THE SMALLEST EMPLOYERS DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF BUSINESS IS THAT HAVE. CLOSED OVER THE DURATION OF A PANDEMIC THE SMALL BUSINESSES- TURNING THAN THE NEXT SLIDE. A SIMILAR PATTERN HERE WE ARE LOOKING AT KIND OF TOTAL BUSINESS ENCUMBER PROPRIETORS INCOME WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY INCOME TO ALL NON CORPORATE BUSINESSES. WE SEE A SIMILAR PATTERN HERE WHERE BUSINESS INCOME DROPPED OFF MORE THAN AND IT HAS STARTED TO CLIMB BACK BUT EVEN STILL. ALL REMAINS WELL BELOW- KIND OF THE LEVELS WE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED IF WE'D WRITTEN REMAINED ON THE PRE PANDEMIC GROWTH PATH WHICH YOU CAN SEE IS THAT KIND OF LIGHT BLUE LINE THERE ON THE CHARTS SO. STILL HAVE NOT RECOVERED. TO THE LEVELS WE WERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC- SO BUT LOOKING A LITTLE MORE. IN DETAIL IT A COUPLE OF THE BIG. DRIVERS OF WHY WE SEEN A DECLINE EMPLOYERS WHY WE'VE SEEN A DECLINE IN BUSINESS INCOME IF WE CAN. GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE- ONE OF THE KEY STORIES HERE IS THAT. THERE WAS A SUDDEN AND DRAMATIC DECLINE IN. CONSUMER SPENDING AND DEMAND EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC AND- THAT SUSTAINED A PARTICULARLY FOR. CERTAIN SECTORS. OF OVER MUCH OF THE LAST YEAR- AND SO YOU CAN SEE. WALL SPENDING. AMONG CALIFORNIANS IN AND SORRY LET ME BACK UP A LITTLE BIT THE START SHOWING. AND IT TOTALED A CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD SPENDING AMONG ALL CALIFORNIANS- YOU CAN SEE TOTAL SPENDING WENT DOWN- BUT IT'S PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED FOR BUSINESSES IN THE LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY OR SO. RESTAURANTS HOTELS ENTERTAINMENT VENUES. OF HUGE DROP OFF IN SPENDING THEIR REMAIN DEPRESSED FOR MUCH OF THE LAST YEAR IN A LITTLE BIT OF A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE HERE AT THE END YOU CAN SEE HERE JUST. THE MOST RECENT DATA IN JUNE. DOES SO THAT WE ARE FINALLY STARTING TO SEE SOME RECOVERY IN SPENDING IN THOSE AREAS SO THAT'S A HOPEFUL SIGN AND SOMETHING TO FOLLOW GOING FOR BUT NONE THE LESS. THESE BUSINESSES HAVE DEALT WITH- YOU KNOW DEMAND FOR THEIR SERVICES BEING DEPRESSED WELL BELOW NORMAL LEVELS FOR OVER A YEAR- NEXT SLIDE- RELATED TO THIS STORY- IS. THAT TOURISM TO CALIFORNIA- SO HAS HAD A SIMILAR DRAMATIC FALL AT THE BEGINNING THE PANDEMIC. AND MAYBE UNLIKE THE SPENDING HAS STILL NOT RECOVERED- THIS THIS IS SHOWING. AIRLINE TRAVEL BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TO CALIFORNIA BASED ON. SOME DATA FROM VISIT CALIFORNIA. AND AIRLINE TRAVEL FELL BY MORE THAN TWO THIRDS EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC AND IT'S STILL- MORE THAN A THIRD IN TERMS OF DOMESTIC TRAVEL BELOW WHERE IT WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SO A LOT OF RECOVERY THERE. TO STILL BE HAD IN TERMS OF TOURISM- AND THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE LEGISLATURE IS HAS ALREADY- TAKEN SOME ACTIVE INTERVENTION IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO VISIT CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE THROUGH THE BUDGET TO KIND OF UP THE- THE STATE'S MARKETING EFFORTS THERE- AND ANOTHER THE SO THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING DEFINITELY TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT MOVING FORWARD TO SEE IF IT IS EFFECTIVELY. HELPING TO REVERSE THIS PATTERN. A COUPLE OF OTHER. A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS FOR THE- THE COMMITTEE TO KEEP ITS EYE ON MOVING FORWARD TO FALL THE RECOVERY. OF OUR DEVELOPMENTS IN IN LABOR MARKETS AND WITH INFLATION SO IF WE COULD GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE- IN TERMS OF LABOR MARKETS A HOPEFUL SIGN IS THAT IN RECENT MONTHS WE'VE SEEN THAT. JOB OPENINGS- HAVE. GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY AND IN FACT AND IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ARE AT KIND OF HISTORIC HIGHS. AT LEAST SINCE WE'VE BEEN TRACKING THIS DATA- AT THE SAME TIME. IF WE GO TO NEXT SLIDE AT THE SAME TIME- EMPLOYMENT IN THE MOST IMPACTED SECTORS LIKE LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY WHICH WE'RE SEEING HERE REMAINS. A SIGNIFICANTLY DEPRESSED- AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN QUITE THE REBOUND IN EMPLOYMENT. IN THE LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY SECTORS THAT WE WOULD EXPECT KIND OF COMMENSURATE WITH. THE UPTAKE AND JOB POSTINGS THE UPTICK IN DEMAND FOR- WORKERS AND THE DEMAND FOR THE SERVICES IN THIS SECTOR. SO THERE THERE DOES APPEAR TO BE SOME FRICTIONS PERHAPS SHORT TERM FRICTIONS IN- BRINGING WORKERS BACK INTO THESE BUSINESSES- AND THAT'S SO THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING I SUSPECT WILL BE. A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION AMONG SOME OF THE OTHER PANELS LATER TODAY AND SOMETHING FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER MOVING FORWARD IN. THE CAN YOU CONTINUE TO TRACK. AW A FINAL KIND OF A DATA POINTED TO KEEP TO KEEP AN EYE ON TO- WITH TRACKING THE RECOVERY MOVING FORWARD IS WITH- INFLATION SO IF WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD OFTEN. ON THE NEWS OR AND MEDIA. THAT THE RECENT MONTHS I'VE SEEN A MARKET UPTAKE IN INFLATION- AND THIS IS- THIS GRAPHIC HERE SHOWING ONE. COMMON MEASURE OF THAT THAT IS PERHAPS MORE RELEVANT FOR BUSINESS IS CALLED THE PRODUCER PRICE INDEX. I KIND OF CAPTURES THE BROADCAST OF MANY GOODS AND SERVICES AND WE SEE HERE OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS. A SIGNIFICANT UPTICK IN KIND OF COSTS THAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT BUSINESSES TO BE FACING. AND SO IF THIS WERE TO BECOME A MORE PERMANENT PATTERN THAT WOULD YOU KNOW BE A PRETTY IMPORTANT PRESSURE FOR BUSINESSES MOVING FORWARD- HOPEFULLY OF MANY MOST. ECONOMISTS AT THE MOMENT APPEAR TO THINK THAT THIS WILL BE A TEMPORARY THING MORE OF A REFLECTION OF. THE FRICTIONS INHERENT OF BRAIN KIND OF THE ECONOMY BACK ONLINE AND THAT WE'RE SEEING SUDDEN DEMAND FOR THINGS BEFORE BUYING BEFORE AND BUSINESSES ARE HAVING A HARD TIME RAMPING BACK UP TO MEET THAT- AND THAT HOPEFULLY THAT WILL KIND OF WORK ITSELF OUT IN THE COMING MONTHS- BUT- NONETHELESS THIS IS KIND OF ALSO AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR TO. TO FOLLOW ARE MOVING FORWARD TO. BET THAT COULD YOU KNOW CREATE ADDITIONAL PRESSURE FOR BUSINESSES. OF SO- THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION- BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL. THANKS FOR THAT AND FOR PUTTING PLAINTIFF AT THE SIDES- I JUDGE THE BENCH QUESTIONS BUT I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS HEAR FROM ALL OF OUR PANELISTS AND THEN I. JUMP INTO IT TO QUESTIONS ON THAT FOR YOU AND FOR THE OTHER FACTS- THANKS MR YELLA. AND I THINK NEXT WE ARE GOING TO TURN TO OUR AT OUR SCREEN AND WE'RE JOINED BY BIANCA PLAN QUEST FROM SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING EIGHT- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AND CONGRADULATIONS CHAIRWOMAN ONLINE- THIS BRAND NEW- COMMITTEE OKAY TO BE HERE- I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SHARE MY SCREEN IN. OKAY GREAT. I SO AGAIN MY NAME IS BIANCA BLEW PAST THEM WITH AN ORGANIZATION CALLED SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY- I'D LOVE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR ORGANIZATION AND- AND- HOPEFULLY IT WILL HELP UNDERSCORE- OUR GOAL ON THIS PANEL TODAY SO EXCITED TO BE PRESENTING WITH DOCTOR FAIRLY AND BRIAN LMAO- SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY IS A NATIONAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION- WE ADVOCATE FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY BUT ESPECIALLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA ON ISSUES RELATED TO ACCESSING CAPITAL AND PREDATORY LENDING- AND HOW CAN SMALL BUSINESSES- PROVIDE QUALITY JOBS FOR THEIR WORK FORCE. NOW WE DO THIS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR CONVERSATIONS JUST LIKE THESE WITH POLICY MAKERS SUCH AS THIS HAPPENS YOU'RE STUCK OUT AS WELL ACT AS A LOT OF EDUCATION IT DIRECTLY WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ON THESE ISSUES IN FACT MY ROLE IS SOMEWHAT UNIQUE IN THAT IT'S LET TIME OUT WHICH MEANS I SACRAMENTO WORKING ON POLICY ISSUES AND WORKING DIRECTLY WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS WE CONDUCT THIRD. PARTY INDEPENDENT THERE'S A SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS NATIONWIDE INSTEAD UNLIKE THAT AND REAL EXCITED TO SHARE OF THE DTA THAT WE BEEN COLLECTING OUT THERE ARE THIRD PARTY IN THE- BLINK ALSO THROUGHOUT OUR NETWORK OF APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. I WE'VE BEEN CHATTING WITH THEM- TALKING TO THEM ENGAGING THAT BAND. PANDEMIC TO REALLY GET IT THAT IT'S SENSE OF WHAT THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THROUGHOUT CLOTHING NINETEEN. ANOTHER THING I LIKE UNDERSCORE OF THE AVERAGE SIZE OF A SMALL BUSINESS AND SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITIES NETWORK IS APPROXIMATELY FOUR EMPLOYEES SO THIS IS WHAT WE CALL. IT SAID THAT THESE ARE BUSINESSES THAT TYPICALLY HAVE LESS THAN TEN EMPLOYEES- AND I THINK- AS MANY OF THAT'S KNOWN NOW- IF. IT'S IN THESE THESE BUSINESS OWNERS IN PARTICULAR ARE CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY ANDLOCAL COMMUNITIES. THAT WORK FOREST XTERRA. IT'S ALSO IN TO. THAT THE- THIS ACT. LATE AT HALF OF AMERICA'S PRIVATE SECTOR WORKFORCE- AND MOST OF THE NEW JOBS CREATED ARE ARE IN A MICRO BUSINESS INSIDE THE YOU KNOW ONE BEFORE AND PLEASE. AFTER THE ACCESS TO CAPITAL ISSUES- AT CHAIRWOMAN YOU DID ALLUDE TO THAT THE BEGINNING OF THE- HAVE A COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY AFTER THAT THE CAP WILL HAVE BEEN. ON A HUGE ISSUE FOR SMALL BUSINESS EVEN BE OR OTHER COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC- FRANKLY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE CONSIDERED TOO RISKY TO GET A SMALL BUSINESS LOAN FROM TRADITIONAL UNDER BURKE. SB A LOANS OFTEN TAKE TOO LONG FOR TYPICAL SMALL BUSINESS TO ACCESS THEIR PRODUCTS OR HAVE PERSONAL COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE FRANKLY UNACHIEVABLE FOR MANY FOLKS- IN FACT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HIT NEARLY ONE IN FOUR BUSINESS OWNERS DID NOT EVEN HAVE. A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BANK OR A CREDIT UNION. I THINK THE PANDEMIC MAKE MADE PLAIN FOR EVERYONE TO SEE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT THAT- KOBE NINETEEN AND THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. I HAVE ARMED BUSINESS THE RESULT. IN PARTICULARLY WHEN ACCESSING pCAPITAL THAT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE QUALITY JOBS. A STEADY JOBS FOR THEIR WORKERS- AND TO RUN A BUSINESS EFFECTIVELY. I WENT SEEKING CAPITAL SMALL BUSINESS. OWNERS THE COLOR AND WOMEN ENCOUNTER SYSTEMIC BARRIERS LIKE SEXISM AND RACISM IN ADDITION TO BEING IN THE GENERAL RISK POOL OF ARCH OF AN ENTREPRENEUR. IN FACT OUR DATA SHOWS- AND WE HAVE LINKS TO OUR DATA- UNDERNEATH THAT FLIGHTS. AT 32% OF OUR- CALLS ARE HANDLED THAT'S FINANCING THAN THEY THOUGHT COPYRIGHT I MEAN PERCENT OF WHITE BUSINESS. I'M TOLD I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE. BIT OF A WEIRD CONNECTION ISSUE. I'M NOT SURE OKAY. I I'M NOT SURE BUT ON ON OUR SIDE OR ON YOUR SIDE THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO. TRY TO YEAH MAYBE JOINT TRY TURNING OFF YOUR VIDEOS YOU'RE JUST STREAMING THAT THE AUDIO AND SCREEN PRESS MY- YEAH AT THE END BUT ANYONE SECOND. I'M MUSEUM REALITY. WOULD IT BE TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE WITHOUT A TECHNICAL ISSUE. IF. EACH IS THE SECOND YEAR. OKAY CAN YOU SEE MY SCREEN WE CAN SEE YOUR SCREEN YEAH LET'S TRY THAT. OKAY AND SO I WAS I WAS CHATTING ABOUT THE PRE PANDEMIC ISSUES THAT WERE EXACERBATED BY COCA NINETEEN PRIMARILY FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS COLOR WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS- THAT HAVE- THAT THE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS IN ACCESSING CAPITAL. THESE ARE SOME OF THE ACTIONS WERE TAKEN I CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES IN REACTION TO KOBE NINETEEN I'M MANY OF THESE ARE VERY INTUITIVE- I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT GIVEN THE FACT THAT MICROBICIDE PLOY. I HALF OF THE WORKFORCE AT THAT THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE HOURS I'M TRYING TO THINK IT'S THIS AND THAT LIKE IN THAT L. A. O. PRESENTATION AND THE CUTTING OF EMPLOYEE HOURS AND CLOSING BUSINESSES TEMPORARILY- MORE SOME OF THE TOP ACTIONS. THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS DEBT IN REACTION TO OF IT NINETEEN. I ALSO WANTED TO FLAG SOME OF THE SMALL BUSINESS DISPLACEMENT ISSUES AND READ CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE SEEING- IN RELATION TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW HAT IT'S VERY UNCLEAR. ON TO GET AN EXACT NUMBER ON A COMMERCIAL RENTS AFTER AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EFFORTS- IN THE LEGISLATURE TO. TACKLE THE RESIDENTIAL RENT PROBLEM. ON AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS TO ON EXTENDED COMMERCIAL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DELAYED THE WORK PERFECT GEN. I'M HERE HERE'S WHAT WE DO NOW ALMOST 80% OF COMMERCIAL TENANTS ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY RENT OF 46% OF THEM ARE SAYING THERE ARE MULTIPLE MONTHS BEHIND ON THEIR RENT OR MORTGAGE- AS AN EXAMPLE A CITY OFFICIAL. DILLON SAN JOSE TOLD ME THAT LAST NIGHT 25% OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN SAN JOSE ON THEIR PROPERTY WITH SIXTY TWO THOUSAND ACTIVE IN THE CITY. MORE THAN HALF ARE EXPOSED TO ADDICTION. AN ESTIMATED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND COMMERCIAL TENANTS AND SAN JOSE ARE CURRENTLY PROTECTED BY. ITS ORIGINAL. PLAN AND SAN JOSE ALONE. AGAIN THE UC AFFECTION IF WERE. ARE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MAY CHOOSE TO EXTEND THEM THROUGH SEPT TIMBRE- BUT NOT ALL. AT COUNTIES ARE DOING THAT. SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT SMALL BUT IT IS THE NEXT DOWNTURN SUPPORT QUALITY SOLUTIONS TO MAKE LOANS MORE AFFORDABLE- OUR RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT 71% OF SMALL BUSINESSES SUPPORT POLICY LEGISLATION HELLO FOLLOWING COMMUNITY LENDER LIKE CDFI IS TO MAKE MORE AFFORDABLE LOANS TO THOSE UNDER BUSINESSES THAT ARE LARGELY LEFT OUT OF THE TRADITIONAL BANKING SECTOR THAT WE CHATTED ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENTATION. THE US THE END OF. THE THREE AND THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE KINDS OF POLICY SOLUTIONS THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS SUPPORT INVESTED TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE CITY'S BUDGET SURPLUS INTO THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING PLAN. WHICH IS A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT LEVERAGES THE STATE EIGHT CDFI NETWORK THAT ALREADY EXISTS. THIS REQUIRE A VEHICLE FOR LOCAL AND REGIONAL INVESTMENT. THE CITY ALSO KICKED IN AN ADDITIONAL TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE THESE LOANS INTEREST FREE FOR SAN FRANCISCO SMALL BUSINESSES. SANTA CLARA COUNTY SUPERVISOR IS JUST MAKE IT IN AND SEE IT SOONER THAN ALLEN BURKE AGREED TO INVEST SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING PLAN IN JANUARY. AND I'M WRAPPING UP MY PRESENTATION HERE AGAIN TO UNDERSCORE THAT. THE IMPACT THAT HELPING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TODAY WE'LL HAVE OUR WORK WORST AND- THE ABILITY FOR FOLKS TO ACCESS QUALITY JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. DURING NETWORK SURVEY 22% OF SMALL BUSINESSES SAY THAT- BUSINESS CONDITIONS ARE STILL ON THE DECLINE. IF THIS SPEAKS TO THE L. PLAYER DATA THAT BRIAN- OUTLINED IN HIS PRESENTATION AND- IN OUR DECEMBER SURVEY OF CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES WITH MORE THAN EMPLOYEE HEAD COUNTS TO FREAKONOMICS LEVELS. I SPOKE TO A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER JUST THE OTHER WEEK AND SHE SAID SHE DOESN'T EXPECT ANY KIND OF ZERO. TO REQUEST WORKERS HAVE TO PRINT PANDEMIC LEVELS. TOPPING THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS OF COLOR WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE FOR WHOM ENGLISH MIGHT NOT BE THEIR FIRST. LANGUAGE IS NOT. WORK FOR ALL BUSINESS OWNERS. REALLY UNDERSCORES THE IMPACT THAT THESE BUSINESSES HAVE ON THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN FACT WE HAVE- RESEARCH THAT DEMONSTRATES. BUSINESS OWNERS OF COLOR EMPLOY MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR. 55% OF BUSINESS OWNERS OF COLOR HAVE STAFF THAT ARE COMPRISED MOSTLY OF PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN AND FORMER EMPLOYER THAN INITIAL MOST MALE BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE IT 70% OF THE WORKFORCE THAT'S LESS THAN HALF FEMALE. AND ONE THANK WORK FOR BUSINESS OWNERS AND ALMOST ENTIRELY WOMEN THAT 75% OR MORE WHILE ONLY 4% OF MEN DO THINK. I AND WITH THAT I WOULD LOVE IT TOO I THINK IT STANDS AT THE END OF THE PANEL AGAIN I JUST WANTED TO UNDERSCORE THE IMPACT THAT MICRO BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE. ON THE ECONOMY ON OUR WORKFORCE PARTICULARLY AMONG WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS OF COLOR THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN POLICY SOLUTION AND LIKE THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING. AND OURS IF I'M NOT CORRECT IN ADDITION TO THE AMAZING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT HELPS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS NAVIGATE THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AHEAD. WE KNOW THAT MANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE GOING ARE ALREADY SEEKING OUT MORE CAPITAL BOTH IN THE- FORM OF A FOR LOOP. AND AN ABI GRANT THE BACK 80% OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS SOMEWHAT UNSURPRISINGLY I'M SUPPORT GRANTED. AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER AT CENTERS LIKE WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS. SPDC IS ARE THERE TO HELP THE. ALONG THE WAY THANK YOU THANK. THANK YOU I THINK YOU MISSED FROM QUEST AND AS WE SAID WE'LL WE'LL SAVE QUETIONS AND TAX IN CONVERSATION FOR THE END OF THIS PANEL ON WITH THAT AT PLEASED TO WELCOME DR ROBERT FAIRLY THANKS FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME SO CHAIR PATRICK NORRIS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO I'D LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE STATE OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA SO OFTEN THE PRESENTATION SET UP. THE JUSTICE START OUT I'M A PROFESSOR ECONOMICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ. I'M ALSO ONE OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SACRAMENTO CENTER. AND ALSO A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH. I'VE BEEN DOING RESEARCH ON SMALL BUSINESSES. IN GENERAL AND ALSO BUSINESSES OWNED BY DIFFERENT- DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE YOU KNOW US. FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS AND ALSO THE US CENSUS BUREAU AND ALSO SOME ORGANIZATIONS IN CALIFORNIA TO DO. WORK IN THIS AREA SO NEXT FIVE. I THEN JUST GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE GIVE THE BACKGROUND. OKAY SO AS WE KNOW COVER NINETEEN HIT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS VERY HARD SO MARCH ELEVENTH WAS KIND OF THE KEY DATE WHEN THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ANNOUNCED. THAT WITH THE PANDEMIC WHICH SURPRISED MANY OF US OF COURSE AND IT WAS EARLY APRIL WHERE WE REALLY SAW THE FIRST DEVASTATIONS. SO NEXT FIVE. SO THERE'S- KIND OF A SERIES OF DATA FROM THE SMALL BUSINESS ARE STARTED FROM THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS SHOWING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND THEIR ACTIVE. KIND OF SEE OVER THE GREAT RECESSION THERE WAS ACTUALLY ONLY A 5% DROP. IN THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE BUSINESS OWNERS AND THAT WAS OVER A YEAR AND A HALF THE GREAT RECESSION LASTED. THAT ALL THE THIRTY FEET APRIL TWENTY TWENTY AND IT WAS JUST ON A SCALE BEYOND ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE SO WE LOST 22% OF ALL. BACK TO BUSINESS OWNERS IN THAT ONE MONTH. RIGHT SO MUCH LARGER THAN ANYTHING WE THOUGHT. BUT THAT NUMBER ACTUALLY. HIDES A LOT OF WHAT'S GOING ON. BENEATH IT IN TERMS OF DEMOGRAPHICS CEMEX SLIDE. SO WHAT WE SAW THAT ACTUALLY GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION WITH SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT I DID VERY EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC. SO SOME OF THIS RESEARCH CAME OUT IN JUNE AND JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY IS THAT FOR BLACK BUSINESS OWNERS WE SAW 41% DROP IN BUSINESS ACTIVITY. THAT WAS A HUGE CONCERN RIGHT A LOT AMONG. A LOT OF- YOU KNOW THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND POLICYMAKERS BUT ALSO LET NEXT BUSINESSES DROPPED BY OVER 30% IN ASIAN BUSINESS OWNERS DROPPED BY A HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. NEXT FIVE. SO THEN WHAT HAPPENED SINCE APRIL IS REALLY IMPORTANT YOU KNOW HOW WE RECOVERED. AGAIN FOCUSING ON SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THEMSELVES NOT SO MUCH THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE EMPLOYER BUSINESSES OR LARGER BUSINESSES THESE ARE ACTUAL INDIVIDUALS OWNING BUSINESSES. THE NEXT. FIVE I'M WHAT YOU CAN SEE IF THERE WAS A STEADY RECOVER. AFTER APRIL MAY JUNE JULY WE JUST SAW THIS KIND OF STEADY INCREASE. IN BUSINESS OWNER ACTIVITY ALL THE WAY UNTIL OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY. TEN THINGS TURNED AROUND WE THOUGHT DROPPED BY THESE BUSINESS OWNERS STOPPED. RUNNING THEIR BUSINESSES AT LEAST ACTIVELY RUNNING THEIR BUSINESS. AND THAT DROP HAPPENED ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND IN THE FEBRUARY. AND THEN OF COURSE WE'VE SEEN THIS KIND OF RECOVERY SINCE VACCINATIONS HAVE BEEN ROLLED OUT OF PEOPLE BECOME MUCH MORE CONFIDENT. NOT JUST THE OWNERS BUT ALSO CUSTOMERS ARE STARTING TO COME BACK. AND WE SEE KIND OF THE STUDY AND INCREASE NEXT. FIVE WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS FOR DIFFERENT. BUSINESSES OWNED BY MINORITY GROUPS WHAT WE SEE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY SIMILAR PATTERN WE SEE THIS KIND OF INCREASE WITH A BIG DROP IN APRIL THAT I SHOWED YOU BEFORE BUT THEN AN INCREASE EVERY SINGLE MONTH SINCE THEN. BEEN A BIT OF A DOWNTURN SINCE OCTOBER TO THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN A REBOUND. THAT HAPPENS YOU KNOW MORE RECENTLY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. NEXT FIVE. SO WHAT HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA SO ACTUALLY COMPILED ALL THE DATA FOR CALIFORNIA. NEXT. FIVE AND WHAT YOU SEE IS ACTUALLY VERY SIMILAR PATTERN CALIFORNIA REALLY FALLS THE NATION AS A WHOLE THE BIG DROP IN APRIL THE DROP WAS ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT LARGER IN CALIFORNIA THE REBOUND WITH A LITTLE BIT STRONGER AND THEN OCTOBER WE SEE THAT KIND OF REVERSAL AGAIN AND THEN THE INCREASE IN FEBRUARY COMING BACK. NEXT FIVE. AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THIS BY DIFFERENT MINORITY GROUPS SO LOOKING AT THIS FOR. BLACK BUSINESS OWNERS LACK NEXT BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE ASIAN BUSINESS OWNERS. YOU SEE SOMEONE OF SIMILAR TRENDS THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT. YOU KNOW THE DATA BECOME A LITTLE MORE IMPRECISE- BUT THE GENERAL PATTERN IS STILL SOMEWHAT THEIR FIRST SPECIALLY FABRICATE THIS UP. SO LET'S MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SO ONE OF THE ISSUES THERE IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST THAT WE HAVE THIS RECOVERY ARE HAVING THIS RECOVERY. BUT THOSE ARE MANY MONTHS OF LOST SALES. AND THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THE INCOMES OF THESE BUSINESS OWNERS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN MUCH HARDER TO STUDY. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK ON MORE RECENTLY IS LOOK AT SALES LOSSES SPECIFICALLY IN CALIFORNIA AND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. TO EXAMINE THAT EXACT QUESTION TO TRY TO GET THIS ISSUE OF. IF THESE BUSINESS OWNERS WERE INACTIVE IN APRIL MAY YOU KNOW MANY OF THEM IN JUNE THEN WE HAVE THAT KIND OF DROPPED AGAIN. IN OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER HOW MUCH WAS LOST. IN TOTAL OVER THIS ENTIRE YEAR NEXT FIVE. FOUR THIRTY THIS AND USING THE DATA FROM THE CD TFA AND YOU CAN SEE THE HUGE DROP IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY SO THE STATE OUR QUARTERLY NOT MONTHLY IT WAS A 15% DROP IN TOTAL SALES AMONG ALL CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. THEN YOU CAN SEE IN THE QUARTER THREE THERE WAS A BIT OF A RECOVERY BUT IT'S STILL MUCH LOWER THAN OUR NORMAL WHICH IS YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT YEAR OVER YEAR. RIGHT SO THIS IS ALL ADDRESSING SORT OF SEASONALITY ISSUES. BUT THEN YOU CAN SEE THAT QUARTER FOR DIDN'T LOOK SO GOOD FOR AYE WE DROPPED AGAIN- AND OF COURSE THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE QUARTER ONE DATE IS NOT IT YES. AVAILABLE BUT IT WILL SOON BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL. NEXT FIVE. HOW DOES THE FLIP BY SECTOR. OF COURSE AS BRIAN WAS SHOWING EARLIER ACCOMMODATIONS JUST GOT HIT EXTREMELY HARD. QUARTER TO WE SAW A 90% DROP IN SALES. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE THERE'S NOTHING EVEN CLOSE TO IT AND YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE DATA GOING FOR. BACK A LONG TIME YOU CAN SEE RESTAURANTS WERE ALSO HIT EXTREMELY HARD. AND THAT DOES INCLUDE ALL THE YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT INCLUDES ALL THE TAKE OUT RESTAURANTS THAT THE KIND OF CHAIN RESTAURANTS THAT WERE SORT OF HAD THEIR DRIVE THRU IS OPEN. AND AT LEAST SOME TAKE OUT SERVICE RUNNING BUT STILL WE SEE HUGE DROPS FOR THOSE TWO SECTORS. IMAGE SHOWS YOU THAT IT WASN'T JUST A QUARTER TO A QUARTER THREE AND QUARTER FOUR ARE STILL LAGGING. OFFER TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT'S THAT'S SHOWING YOU JUST KIND OF THE DEVASTATION OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE BEING HIT HARD. NEXT SLIDE. HOW DOES THIS LOOK BY SECTOR IS IT TRUE FOR ALL SECTORS THERE A LOT OF FACTORS THAT WERE HIT HARD I HAVE. YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF THEM LISTED HERE. BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE RIGHT WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT HARDWARE STORES. GROCERY STORES. ENOUGH ONE TO THE FAR RIGHT THAT THING GRAY THERE ARE NON STORE RETAILERS. AND SO THOSE ARE ONLINE SALES. WENT WAY UP. DURING THE PANDEMIC NEXT FIVE. IF YOU FOCUS ON THE DIFFERENT QUARTERS YOU KNOW QUARTER TO WE THOUGHT HUGE JUMP OVER 180% QUARTER THREE THERE WAS A BIG INCREASE QUARTER FOR THERE WAS A BIG INCREASE SO IT WASN'T JUST A SHORT TERM A FACT NOT PART OF THIS WAS BECAUSE THE CHANGES IN THE WAY SALES TAXES ARE pCOLLECTED. FOR ONLINE RETAIL. A LOT OF THIS IS REAL A LOT OF THIS IS JUST SHIFTED FROM SMALL BUSINESSES FROM STOREFRONTS. TO ONLINE SALES. NEXT. FIVE NOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO TO MOVE FORWARD YOU KNOW ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT THAT BIANCA MENTION WAS ACCESS TO FINANCIAL CAPITAL. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS THAT ESPECIALLY MINORITY BUSINESSES FACE IF YOU JUST LOOK AT ONE NUMBER TWO NUMBERS HERE- THE MEDIAN NET WORTH OF BLACK FAMILIES IN THE U. S. IS NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN DOLLARS THAT MEANS 50% OF BLACK FAMILIES HAVE LESS. THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN NETWORK THAT ADDING UP ALL THE HOUSING EQUITY. THE VALUE ON THEIR STOCKS ARE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. ADDING UP THE VALUE OF THEIR CAR IT'S LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND FOR LATIN NEXT IT'S TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. NOW WHEN YOU SWITCH OVER TO LOOK AT WHITE FAMILIES THAT NUMBER JUMPS ALL THE WAY TO HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO WEALTH INEQUALITIES ON A SCALE THAT'S WAY BEYOND ANYTHING WE SEE FOR INCOME. OR ANY OTHER MEASURE THAT WE HAVE ECONOMICALLY. SO THAT JUST CREATES A HUGE CONSTRAINTS IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ACCESS CAPITAL SO THAT THAT'S CLEARLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS IT'S BEEN ONE. FOR MANY YEARS AND IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW IS THEY SHOWED YOU THOSE BIG LOSSES IN SALES AND BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OVER TIME. THE OTHER ONE NO I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE. IS WE'VE REALLY SEEN AN EXTENSIVE SHIFT TO ONLINE SHOPPING THERE'S NO DOUBT RIGHT WE'VE SEEN IT FOR ALL GROUPS OF THE POPULATION FOR ALL TYPES OF CUSTOMERS. PREVIOUSLY ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS WERE RELUCTANT TO GO ONLINE TO SHOP AND NOW THEY'RE NOT RIGHT THERE USING INSTACART THEY'RE USING AMAZON THEY'RE USING. YOU KNOW SAFE WAYS DELIVERY SERVICES. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAPPEN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC BUT WAS GREATLY ACCELERATED DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A IMPORTANT ONE IS THAT WE NEED TO. GET CUSTOMERS TO GO BACK SHOP LOCAL- YOU KNOW TO KIND OF OFFSET THAT A LITTLE BIT. BUT I THINK SIMILARLY WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GO AWAY FROM THAT I THINK CUSTOMERS NOW LIKE THE CONVENIENCE OF SHOPPING ONLINE. AND THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO KEEP THEIR INVENTORY IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO SET UP WEB PAGES. THAT ARE. BETTER YOU KNOW FAST MOVING THAT CHANGE THAT UPDATE QUICKLY. THAT ARE REALLY USER FRIENDLY. WORDS BIG BOX STORES. ONLINE RETAILERS HAVE THAT SET UP AND IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO DO THAT. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I SEE A SEARCH ENGINES OFTEN PRIORITIZE SOME LARGE BUSINESSES RIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE PAYING. THE ADS. BUT THEY COULD PRIORITIZE LOCAL BUSINESSES THEY COULD GO AND SAY LOOK YOU'RE THE LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WILL SELL THIS EXACT PRODUCT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. YOU SEARCH FOR LEVI'S JEANS IT COULD SHOW YOU THE LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE THAT. THING THAT YOU WANT THAT PRODUCT THAT YOU WANT. INSTEAD OF FOCUSING SO MUCH ON ONLINE RETAILERS I THINK THAT COULD BE A YOU KNOW AN IMPORTANT WAY WE COULD START TO TURN THIS AROUND. FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY SMALL BUSINESSES OWNED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR IN. AND IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR FARLEY. AB SO I'VE GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND THEN. LEFT IT OPEN UP THANK YOU MISS CREA FOR RAP FOR BEING HERE AND FOR BEING PART OF THIS COMMITTEE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. TO JUST TO START. I REALIZE THAT THIS AT THIS ECONOMIC THE ECONOMIC SHOCK THAT WE SIDE THROUGHOUT THE CABIN NINETEEN CRISIS REALLY IS KIND OF UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN AND IT SEEMS SIMILARLY THE RECOVERY IS DIFFERENT THAN. RECOVERY THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN I'M BUT ARE THERE LESSONS THAT WE THAT WE THAT WE LEARNED IN THE- PAST TWO THOUSAND EIGHT PERIOD THAT- WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE TO SMALL BUSINESS AND AS WE THINK ABOUT- HOW DO WE- AT HOW DO WE OPTIMALLY NAVIGATE THAT THE COMING MONTHS FOR. CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS. I THAT THAT'S A QUESTION FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO WANTS TO JUMP IN. I MEAN I CAN JUMP YEAH YOU KNOW BECAUSE I STUDIED THE GREAT RECESSION PRETTY CAREFULLY. THEY'RE WHAT WE SAW WAS A PRETTY CONTINUE RECOVERY RIGHT AND THAT THEY SHOWED YOU HERE. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF SPUTTERING. YES YOU KNOW KIND OF STARTING AND STOPPING AND STARTING AGAIN AND STOPPING. AND THAT'S BEEN REALLY DIFFICULT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT BEFORE. IN THE PREVIOUS RECOVERY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS A REAL PROBLEM IS ACCESS TO CAPITAL RIGHT IS TO BE ABLE TO. TO AS BIANCA WAS MENTIONING EARLIER ABOUT PAYING RENT WITH A HUGE PROBLEM RIGHT IS. IF YOU'VE GOT A BIG DECREASING PASTERN BAND HOW DO YOU PAY THE RENT THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU KNOW IF YOU- EVERY SINGLE MONTH. AND ALSO THE SALARIES FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES. THAT'S DIFFICULT AND RECESSION. IT'S NOT CLEAR YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO GET LABOR THAT WAS ALSO BROUGHT UP EARLIER- THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A LOT OF PENT UP CONSUMER DEMAND THAT WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT- BUT I DO THINK LIKE ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND BEING ABLE TO PAY RENT IS GONNA BE SOMETHING WE DEFINITELY LEARNED FROM THE PREVIOUS RECESSION THE FACT THAT. AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH. AND IT IS I ACTUALLY LET I WANT TO DIG INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I KNOW. I'M A DOCTOR FAIRLY AND ALSO A MUSLIM QUEST. HIGHLIGHTED THAT. AS AS AS A- KEY CHALLENGE AGAIN. ONE THAT CERTAINLY PRECEDED THE PANDEMIC BUT AS HAS I THINK BEEN HIGHLIGHTED AND GAS. EXACERBATED BY IT- ARE THERE SEND. PROGRAM THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT YOU CAN POINT TO EITHER HEARING CALIFORNIA AT REGIONALLY. OR ELSEWHERE IN THE STATES- THAT. WE ARE A GOOD MODEL. FOR US AS WE THINK ABOUT. CONNECTING UP MORE ENTREPRENEURS PARTICULARLY. AT WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES WITH. CAPITAL THAT SO DESPERATELY NEEDED. I MEAN ONE OF THE ONES THAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON IF THE PPP PROGRAMME IN THE IDOL PROGRAM WHICH WERE ALSO AGREED PREVIOUSLY YOU KNOW. DISCUSSED AND- PRESENTATIONS. THOSE PROGRAMS PROVIDED AID RIGHT TO BUSINESSES TO KIND OF KEEP THEM AFLOAT TO KEEP EMPLOYEES YOU KNOW HIRED AT THOSE BUSINESSES WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY DID. THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN THAT THEY WERE NOT. PROPORTIONALLY GIVEN OUT TO MINORITY COMMUNITIES. AND SOME OF THE RESEARCH THAT I'M FINDING NOW IS THAT IT IS ACTUALLY. THAT'S TRUE IN THE EARLY PART BUT IT REVERSED LATER ESPECIALLY IN THE LATEST ROUND OF THE PPP PROGRAM WE'RE ACTUALLY FINDING SOME EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS. YOU KNOW WENT THE OTHER WAY WHICH IS REALLY HELPFUL RIGHT THAT A LOT OF THESE BUSINESSES THAT WERE MOST IN NEED WE'RE GETTING A- AND SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD MODEL- I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF PUSH. TO GET THAT MONEY THROUGH LOCAL BANKS COMMUNITY BANKS HE DEFIES. AND THAT REALLY HELPED AND ALSO FINTECH WITH ANOTHER IMPORTANT ONE RIGHT IS NOT JUST GOING TO THE BIG BANKS WE HAVE THESE ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH KIND OF LARGER SMALL BUSINESSES- IT OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A LOT OF BAD PRESS WHEN THE LAKERS RECEIVED ALONE. DALY SANDWICH WITH ANOTHER ONE RIGHT THERE WERE A FEW OF THESE YOU KNOW CLEARLY BIG BUSINESSES THAT WE'RE GETTING THESE LONG. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S REALLY KIND OF TURNED AROUND AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S BEEN- HOPEFULLY SUCCESSFUL AT THE GANDHI I'M DOING RESEARCH ON IT RIGHT NOW SO WE DON'T KNOW THE REAL ANSWER TO WHETHER OR NOT IT WORKED. AND THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION ANYWAY HEY. WHAT IS IT MEAN TO WORK RIGHT WE HOPE THAT IT SAVED A LOT OF JOBS AND HOPE. WE HOPE THAT IT KEPT THESE BUSINESSES. ARE RUNNING. WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. BUT SAID IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE TAKE AWAY FOR US AS POLICY MAKERS MOVING-FORWARD IS. THAT THE MORE THAT WE ACTIVELY LOOK TO HAVE. COUPLE NOT NOT JUST SAY HEY WE'RE TRYING TO GET. CAPITAL INTO THE HANDS OF UNDERSERVED BUSINESSES THAT THE MORE WE ENSURE THAT THE INTERMEDIARY IS A TRUSTED LOCAL COMMUNITY RESOURCE. THE MORE EFFECTIVELY WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND- OBVIOUSLY IT MEANS WORKING WITH MORE PARTNERS. IT MEANS A PROGRAM THAT'S MORE COMPLICATED BILL TIMIDLY A PROGRAM THAT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND AN ACHIEVER AMBITION AND I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND I THINK THAT. PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THAT CONGRESS. HAD TO BRUSH THE FIRSTRAND PPP PROGRAMME OUT REALLY FAST. AND WHAT'S THE FASTEST WAY TO DO IT YOU GO TO WELLS FARGO YOU GO TO BANK OF AMERICA YOU GO TO CITY BANK. AND GET THEM TO HELP YOU. AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THAT HAS CONSEQUENCES. OKAY YES BIG PLAYERS HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH BIG PLAYERS AND YEAH. SMELTERS MORE LIKELY TO BE SUPPORTING THEIR SPOTTED A LOT FASTER TO GET THOSE BIG PLAYERS TO GET SOMETHING DONE QUICKLY. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD COMPETITION. AND THIS CRAP THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION A DETECTIVE FAIRLY OKAY I AM A PROFESSOR I EIGHT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND I THINK- RELATED TO THE FIRST ROUND AND WHAT WE SAW AND THEN THE SECOND ROUND OF CALIFORNIA CODE RELIEF GRANTS TO IT WAS ACTUALLY TO SUB FOR AND THE WORK THAT WE DID TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT LANGUAGE. SENSITIVITY CULTURAL APPRECIATION THE FACT THAT THE APPLICATION WAS ORIGINALLY ONLY AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH AND ONLINE- THAT IS A HUGE WAS A HUGE- FLAG FOR US TO BE ABLE TO FIX AND WILL FORWARD ESPECIALLY MOAMER SPEAKING ABOUT PUBLIC DOLLARS AND WHO GETS THEM SO I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT IN YOUR IN YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT REPORTING YOU'RE ALSO SEEN SALAS SHIFT WE'RE STILL WAITING. ADAM CHAIR FOUR L'INDUSTRIE TO HAVE MORE INSIGHTFUL DATA TO SHARE WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW IF THE APPLICATION FOR A SMALL BUSINESS A SMALL BUSINESS APPLICATION HAD A WOMAN'S NAME OR A WOMAN OF COLOR I WANT TO ENSURE THAT THAT REAL THAT BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY FROM A WOMAN AND A WOMAN OF COLOR AND NOT JUST. YOU KNOW A POSITION THAT WAS TAKEN ON AN APPLICATION FOR LACK OF A BETTER WAY OF DESCRIBING IN TERMS OF THE EQUITY CONVERSATION- THAT GOES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS THAT WERE APPLYING FOR THE FUNDS- ADDITIONALLY I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO SEE THE DATA WE PUT IN SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA SMALL RELEASE AN ADDITIONAL. HOW MUCH WAS IT- I'M SORRY FOR BILLION TO EXPAND THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM AND SIX POINT TWO BILLION IN SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF THAT ULTIMATELY IS PAID FOR BY THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT CALL CALIFORNIA HOME AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT AS WE RE OPEN SAFELY AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND COALBED RELIEF EFFORTS. THAT WE LEAD WITH THE LENS OF EQUITY TO ENSURE YOUR THAT LANGUAGE. CULTURAL SENSITIVITY ACCESS TO SOME OF THOSE BIG PLAYERS AS ACCESSIBLE AND IF NOT THEN WHAT WHAT IS THE- WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE AVENUE- HOW DO WE EMPOWER MICRO BUSINESSES WHO ALSO NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. WE'RE PUTTING IN FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR- EITC- AND CAL KELLY AT C. OUTRAGE- PROGRAMS WHICH ULTIMATELY ENSURE THAT. UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE WHO ALSO HAVE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE AND I TEND TAX. PAYER DOLLARS- NUMBER SO THEY CAN START PAYING INTO- SOME ADDITIONAL TAXES AS WELL AS RECEIVE SOME ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT THE STATE HAS IF YOU ARE AT I TEND TAX PAYER. I THINK PREVIOUSLY WE HAD BEEN ONLY DOING A LOT OF MUCH OF THE OUT REACH FOR TO EXISTING I TEND TAXPAYERS. VERSUS CREATING A BIGGER POT- THERE ARE. YOU KNOW THERE'S A- A GREAT INTEREST AND I THINK A GREAT OPPORTUNITY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN IN THIS STATE REGARDLESS OF STATUS HAS ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS. AND THAT ULTIMATELY AS WE MOVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD MADAM CHAIR AND WE TALK ABOUT. SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WERE LEADING THROUGH A LENS OF EQUITY AND ALLOWANCE OF DATA. AND HOW WE AT THE END OF THE DAY AS THE LEGISLATURE HAVE THAT DATA TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. AND CREATE POLICY THAT A SOUND THAT IS GOOD AS LONG TERM SO APPRECIATE THIS BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO BEFORE WE TRULY REALLY SEEN. A THE IMPACT ADDITIONALLY I WOULD JUST ADD ONE MORE THING WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK FOR- RENT PROTECTIONS AND TENANT PROTECTIONS. NOT MUCH HAS BEEN DONE TOWARDS COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES I HAD A BILL TWO YEARS AGO THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I INTRODUCED EVERYBODY LOOKED AT ME WITH LIKE A BIG QUESTION MARK LIKE WAS I TALKING ABOUT. BUT I'M SEEN GENTRIFICATION IN MY COMMUNITY EVERY DAY. AND SO WHEN A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER MOM AND POP SHOP HAVE PAID THE STANDARD FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH AND THERE'S NO. CAP AS TO HOW OFTEN AND WHEN. THEY GET THEIR RENT INCREASED SO ONE MONTH IS FIVE TO. THE NEXT MONTH IS TEN THOUSAND THREE MONTHS FROM NOW IT'S AN ADDITIONAL TEN THOUSAND. THEIR RENT JUST ONE. SUPER HIGH AND THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR RENT PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES AND STILL MAKE A PROFIT IS. INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT NO ONE SANE- THAT THE LANDLORD SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RACE RENTS ACCORDINGLY. BUT THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF TENANT PROTECTION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES. THAT CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE ONE SO THAT THE IDENTITY OF NEIGHBORHOODS REMAINS INTACT SO PEOPLE DON'T GO OUT OF BUSINESS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE RENT. SO THAT LOCAL COMMUNITY CAN STILL BE ABLE TO BE EMPLOYED. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT. GIVEN COVE IT WE ALL NOW HAVE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHAT. WHAT DOES IT REALLY LOOK LIKE. TO REOPEN SAFELY AND TO PROVIDE- THE RESOURCES AND TOOLS THAT SMALL BUSINESSES NEED TO BE ABLE TO SUCCEED SO THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION. ONE THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT. FOR ME I THINK IT JUST DRIVES HOME. THE FACT THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A SMALL BUSINESS FAILING. IT'S NOT JUST ONE PERSON'S DREAM. THAT DIES IT'S NOT JUST ONE PERSON'S LIVELIHOOD. IT REALLY IS IT'S LIKE YOU SAID ITS EMPLOYEES THAT ARE OFTEN LIKE FAMILY. IT IS. SOMETIMES A HUB OF THE COMMUNITY IT REALLY IS KIND OF THIS WHOLE ECOSYSTEM THAT'S THAT'S HANGING IN THE BALANCE WHICH IS WHY I THINK. IT'S JUST SUCH A CRITICAL THE CRITICAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC. ENGINE AND THAT IS THE ENGINE THAT CREATES ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AFTER MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. I'M COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO DIVE INTO IN THAT THE FIRST IS THAT DOCTOR FAIRLY. AT THE POINT YOU MADE ABOUT THIS TRANSITION TO- YOU KNOW FROM BRICK AND MORTAR CHAU TO ONLINE WHICH AGAIN. WAS PROCEEDING THE PANDEMIC BUT CERTAINLY. FROM AN OUTSIDE YOU SHOWED WAS JUST SO STRIKING. FIVE CERTAINLY WAS EXHILARATED BY IT. WITH THE DATA THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. HOW PERMANENT IS THAT SHIFT LOOK. HOW MUCH OF THAT DO WE- JUST. SKS HOW MUCH OF THAT IS PERMANENT AND HOW MUCH OF THAT DO WE THINK WE'LL TRANSITION BACK TO THE MORE KIND OF TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD RETAIL CONTEXT. YEAH WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE DATA YEAH CAPITAL YEAH WE'RE THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE KIND OF HE REALLY WAITING TO FIND OUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT'S GOING TO RETURN TO NORMAL. IT'S REALLY NOT CLEAR. YOU KNOW LIKE I LIVE IN SANTA CRUZ CALIFORNIA I'M WE ARE DEFINITELY SEEING KIND OF A BOOM OF. OF PEOPLE VISITING PARTY PAL. WHICH IS A REALLY GOOD SIGN AND THEY ARE GOING TO SMALL BUSINESSES I WAS DOWNTOWN THE OTHER DAY AND IT'S JUST. A LOT OF ACTIVITY- I'VE BEEN HEARING THAT'S KIND OF TRUE IN A LOT OF OTHER PLACES TO IN THE BAY AREA FOR EXAMPLE. I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF I WERE TO IF YOU WERE TO FORCE ME TO GAS I WOULD SAY WE COULD PROBABLY GET 50% OF THAT BACK. PRETTY QUICKLY BUT I DON'T YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S REALLY JUST KIND OF A GAS IT'S NOT CLEAR. I DO THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET THAT BACK DOWN TO LEVELS PRE PANDEMIC. BECAUSE CUSTOMERS REALLY HAVE SHIFTED THEIR- THEIR DESIRE FOR CONVENIENCE RIGHT THEY LIKE. BEING ABLE TO BUY THINGS ONLINE IT'S JUST. YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU STATE YOU'RE USED TO GETTING THAT BOX IN THE MAIL EIGHT- AND THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY. NOW SMALL BUSINESSES COULD PROVIDE THAT ROLE RIGHT THEY COULD THEY COULD ACTUALLY. SELL THE SAME PRODUCTS DELIVER THE SAME PRODUCTS OR HAVE. A SET UP WHERE CUSTOMERS CAN DRIVE BY AND PICK THEM UP JUST LIKE. SAY YOU KNOW SOME OF THE BIG BOX STORE STILL- I JUST THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE WORK TO GET THAT KIND OF INITIAL PUSH. AND THEN WHAT WE MIGHT SEE IS THIS KIND OF TRANSITION TO. BUSINESSES THAT WERE ALREADY HERE. YOU KNOW LEAVING EXITING AND THE NEW BUSINESSES COMING IN BETTER MAYBE YOUNGER A LITTLE MORE DYNAMIC A LITTLE BIT MORE KIND OF ONLINE. WITH A LITTLE MORE ONLINE PRESENCE AND THAT COULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT- WHAT IT IS AS YOU SAID THERE ARE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO BE SUCCESSFUL ONLINE BUT AND THIS I THINK TIES BACK TO. A POINT I. I'M LUCKY LUCKY YOU MADE IN YOUR YOUR FINAL SIDE WHICH IS THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO HELP SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS KIND OF MAKE THAT LEAP AND MAKE THAT MIGRATION. I'M IN SECOND I'M YOUNGER OR ANYONE ARE THERE EXAMPLES OF REGIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT YOU LOOK AT AND SAY THAT'S FIVE STARS WE NEED TO. ROLL THAT OUT ALL ACROSS THE STATE. YEAH HAPPY TO TACKLE THAT AND THANK YOU SO MUCH ON THE QUESTION- ABSOLUTELY THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS IN OUR STATE- I THINK THERE ARE FOURTEEN WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS ON MANY COUNTS EVERY COUNTY HAS A SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER- VETERANS TECHNICAL ASSIST. INVENTORS THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT IS EMBEDDED- WITHIN THE CDFI COMMUNITY FOR EXAMPLE- IS TOP NOTCH WE CALL THAT HIGH TOUCH SUPPORT. ON BECAUSE THEY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CAN REPAY THEIR LOANS ON. UP AND SO- AND REGIONALLY AS WELL THERE ARE PLENTY OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS THAT ARE- PROVIDE THAT ARE DOING GREAT WORK IN EACH AREAS OF THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. WE SEE THIS PARTICULARLY IN THE CHILD CARE INDUSTRY. ON THE EVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS ARE TAKING DEEP DIVES INTO ARE HELPING THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS SEE THEMSELVES AS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN ADDITION. TO CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WHICH IS OUR I'M A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN A NORMAL. IN OUR THE THAT WE SPEAK OF IN CALIFORNIA- I DIDN'T TOUCH ON AND- THE FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT TOWARD ONLINE RETAIL AND SALES AT AND HOW- THIS UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT THE ECOSYSTEM. THAT EXISTS FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IS- HELPING TO INNOVATE PERSON. AT AS WELL AS PROTECT SMALL BUSINESS INTERESTS- FAIR PLATFORM MEANS FOR EXAMPLE AS MANY BUSINESS OWNERS HAVE SHIFTED TO ONLINE SALES- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME- FOOD DELIVERY PLATFORMS FOR EXAMPLE. THAT THE PRACTICE THEM UNSCRUPULOUS BEHAVIORS- I'M IN RE ROUTING CALLS CHARGING EXORBITANT FEES THESE ARE EXAMPLES IN WHICH- WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE FRAMEWORK THAT EXISTS FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TO MOVE. ONLINE ON ITS FACE SHARE ON PROVIDE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR THESE BUSINESS CAN TO- YOU KNOW A TO DELIVER PLOT LIKE DASH OR- FOR- AND EARLIER AT MANY ASKED FOR EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS THAT. HAVE CROPPED UP AT TO ADDRESS THIS FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT- IN THE SMALL BUSINESS LANDSCAPE YOU MENTIONED BE A RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES IS ASK DOCTOR FAIRLY- MENTIONED THE RISE OF INTACT AND I'M NOT SAYING. I'M IF IN FACT I HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY- AND NOT ALL FINTECH IS BACK ON THE SECOND. NIGHT OF A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION TO IT- AND WHAT SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY IS WORKING TO DO ALONGSIDE GROUPS LIKE AT. ON THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS- AND ANY BUSINESS ORGANIZATION ISN'T THAT THE STATE IS MAKING SURE THAT THESE ARE ONLINE LENDERS- CAN CONTINUE PROVIDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICE SAYS THAT THEY ALREADY PER BY TWO BUSINESS OWNERS BUT MAKING SURE THAT THE CONDITIONS ON THE TERMS. OF THE TERMS OF THE LOAN ARE CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT AND CONCISE JUST LIKE THEY ARE FOR CONSUMERS WHEN WE GET AN OFFER IN THE MAIL IT'S IN BOLD LETTERS WE CAN SEE CLEARLY- THAT WOULD BE THE AT AND CREDIBLY HELPFUL FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AS THEY- ARE. PERMANENTLY. SHIFT WITH THIS NEW REALITY. THANKS YES THANK YOU ARE FOR THAT THANKS FOR THOSE POINTS IN A BOTH MS CURRENT SERVE JOTTING DOWN. KNUTSEN SUGGESTION TO DIG INTO AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND THAT'S OF THE FOUR WEEK WE JUMP INTO OUR NEXT PANEL I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON I'M- TRYING TO THINK WAS YOUR YOUR LAST SLIDE- WHICH- I THINK SEEMS TO BE KIND OF THE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR MYSTERY THAT STOPING EVERYONE WHICH IS. THE AS SLOW RECOVERY OF THE LABOR MARKET AND- IT THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND I THINK WE PROBABLY ARE GOING TO TAKE INTO THAT A BIT MORE IN OUR OUR SECOND PANEL. BUT I'D BE VERY INTERESTED IN IN YOUR HYPOTHESES WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THAT IS BEHIND THEM THIS VERY SLOW RECOVERY OVER LABOR MARKET. YEAH I MEAN I THINK. IT'S COMPLICATED ANSWER AND I THINK IT'S I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON I THINK FOR ONE THING. WE WON'T KNOW FOR SURE INTEL WE CAN KIND OF REALLY EXAMINE IT AND RETROSPECT BUT YOU KNOW THAT BEING SAID I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONABLE IDEAS THAT ARE BEING. OF KIND OF PUT FORWARD I THINK ONE ONE THING. GOING BACK TO YOUR POINT ABOUT- LEARNING LESSONS FROM THE GREAT RECESSION IS JUST HOW LONG. YOU KNOW THAT LABOR MARKET RECOVERY TOOK COMING OUT OF THE GREAT RECESSION RIGHT AND- IN SOME RESPECT THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T SEEN- IT'S QUICK OF A RECOVERIES MEANS. WE MIGHT LIKE COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC BUT IT YOU KNOW- COMPETITOR SESSION YOU KNOW WE'VE ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT BOUNCE BOUNCE BACK BETTER IN MOST SECTORS. SO YOU KNOW I THINK THE ONE LESSON FROM THE GREAT RECESSION IT'S JUST THAT. WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE LAID OFF FROM JOBS AND THEY'RE OUT OF WORK FOR. AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME THERE ARE JUST- FRICTIONS AND FINDING NEW GOOD MATCHES WITH EMPLOYERS THAT JUST TAKE TIME AND SO- YOU KNOW I THINK SOME OF THAT. JUST THOSE UNDERLYING DIFFICULTIES OF FINDING A GOOD MATCH BETWEEN A BUSINESS OWNER AND AN EMPLOYEE- IS PART OF. PART OF THE STORY- AND THEN THERE ARE JUST A NUMBER OF KIND OF- YOU KNOW. PERSONAL CHALLENGES THAT WORKERS FACE RIGHT WITH CHILD CARE WITH- WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE IN THE SUMMER WITH WITH SCHOOL AVAILABILITY WITH- YOU KNOW FRANKLY CONCERNS- EVEN. EVEN NOW ABOUT KIND OF PERSONAL SAFETY AND I THINK- EVEN WITH THE- THE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINES OF MANY FOLKS FROM REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT- YOU KNOW BEING. IN CROWDED. CLOSE CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND SOME OF THAT WILL JUST TAKE TIME. OFF FOR FOLKS TO FEEL COMFORTABLE BEING IN THOSE KINDS OF ENVIRONMENTS AGAIN AND THEN. YOU KNOW I THINK- KIND OF ALONG WITH THAT STORY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE SAYING. THEY HAVE THESE PERSONAL- CHALLENGES THAT ARE- WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GO BACK TO WORK AND- WE'VE HAD YOU KNOW AT THE SAME TIME. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO WORKERS THROUGH UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND OTHER THINGS THAT HAS ALLOWED THEM TO NOT FRET PERHAPS NOT HAVE TO GO BACK AND RUSSIAN TO. A JOB WHERE THEY DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT CHILD CARE SUPPORT. SO THERE IS A THERE IS A KIND OF A DYNAMIC- YOU KNOW RELATIONSHIP THERE WITH THE U. I. BENEFITS- YOU KNOW NOT TO SUGGEST THAT. YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY INCREASED YOU AYE BENEFITS ARE ARE- WERE CAUSING PEOPLE TO STAY ON THE SIDELINES FOR NO REASON- BUT FOR FOLKS WHO MIGHT HAVE SOME RESISTANCE IT GIVES THEM. SOME TIME TO WORK SOME OF THOSE THINGS OUT. I AND MAYBE NOT RESPECT TO A JOB WHERE THEY OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO DO SO- CUT A COMPLICATED ANSWER WE WON'T KNOW FOR SURE FOR A LONG TIME BUT I THINK THAT'S THE SOME OF THE MAIN. MAIN POINTS. ANOTHER THAT DOCTOR PER LAYER I MISS UP ON QUESTION ANY. HYPOTHESES ARE ANYTHING YOU'D ADD TO. SO THAT. ALL RIGHT YOU'RE VERY COMPREHENSIVE DRESSING ON THE FACTORS BUT IT'S JUST THAT YES I THINK IN THE RATE THAT THE CALCULATION. HAS CHANGED HER. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS- BUT I THINK IT WILL TAKE IT TO THE NEXT PANEL I'M SURE IT IS CERTAINLY CREATING MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR MANY SMALL BUSINESSES WERE TRIED TO. TO RECOVER AND REBUILD AND REOPEN FULLY. WELL WITH THAT I WILL JUST ONCE AGAIN THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS SO MUCH FOR AT FOR JOINING US I REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR WORK IN THE SPACE AND- LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO PARTNER WITH YOU AS WE- ARE DEVELOP SOLUTIONS AND POLICY PROPOSALS MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT I'M- PLEASED TO WELCOME OUR SECOND PANEL WE ARE JOINED BY AT THAILAND GRAY. FROM I CALIFORNIA'S OFFICE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATES ARE BY MIKE AND DANIEL FROM THE ORANGE COUNTY INLAND EMPIRE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER. AND ROBERT RUBIN YES FROM THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. ARE SLIGHTLY AWKWARDLY T A RANGE CHAD. THE NEW JERSEY SURVIVORSHIP IT WORKS IT'LL IT'LL WORK WE'LL MAKE IT WORK. AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'LL DO SO THIS- THIS PANEL WE'RE GOING TO DO MORE. THERE IS A PET PANEL DISCUSSION AT RATHER THAN PRESENTATIONS BUT BEFORE WE JUMP INTO THAT- I BELIEVE THAT MS GRAY. WE WERE GOING TO GET AN UPDATE FROM YOU ON- THE NEW PROGRAMS COMING IN THE BUDGET. AND AN UPDATE ON THE IMPACT OF THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANT RELIEF PROGRAM- AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DIVE INTO MORE OF A CONVERSATION AROUND AT THE KEY CHALLENGES FACING CALIFORNIA'S SMALL BUSINESSES RIGHT NOW. AND THAT HOPEFULLY DEVELOP SOME POLICY SOLUTIONS. OR PROPOSALS TO START TO ADDRESS THAT. EXCELLENT THANK YOU- CHAIR PETRIE-NORRIS- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING. I'M WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO RIGHT INTO. NO INTRODUCTION GO RIGHT INTO THE- CRAP UPDATE. YEAH IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE A SUBSCRIBER FIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE GREAT REALLY PROGRAM HE BROUGHT PRETTY FAMILIAR BUT- WOULD LIVE YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND WELCOME I THINK A URAC TO YOUR SOMEWHAT NEW ROLE AND YET OVER HALF GRATEFUL TO HAVE YOU IN THIS CAPACITY- AND WITH LOVE. YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON NINE THAT THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE ON NOT THE GREAT REALLY PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR AWESOME WELL- CLEARLY CALIFORNIA IS LEADING THE NATION IN THE STOCK OF RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM THAT OF FOR SMALL BUSINESSES- TO DATE WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY CLOSED ARMS SIX ROUNDS OF THE GRANT PROGRAM. WE HAVE COMPLETED AWARDS TO ALL APPLICANTS IN THE FIRST FIVE ROUNDS AND ARE WARNING BROWN SIX APPLICATIONS AT THIS TIME. WE EXPECTED TO HAVE ALL AWARDS FOR- THE SIX ROUNDS COMPLETED BY MID AUGUST AND- LAST REPORT AS OF JULY SEVENTH. 1-005-500-0400 SEVENTY ONE SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS HAVE BEEN AWARDED FOR A TOTAL OF ONE BILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION. NINE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE DOLLARS TO SELL OVER. ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION- TOTAL HAS BEEN AWARDED TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS THIS DATE- AND FOLLOWING THE CLOSE OF ROUND SIX WE ESTIMATE A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS. WILL HAVE BEEN AWARDED. WONDERFUL I'M AND I THINK AS I SAID IN MY AND MY OPEN RE OPENING REMARKS I THINK THAT AT THE ACTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE TECH IN PARTNERSHIP PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GOVERNOR- IN BOTH EARLY BUDGET ACTION AND THEN AND IN SUBSEQUENT. ACTION I IN THE ADOPTION OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET I THINK IS A TESTAMENT TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS BROAD RECOGNITION- OF THE BOOK THE GRAVITY AND I THINK THE URGENCY. AND NEED TO STABILIZE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES SO THAT WE CAN POSITION THEM TO THRIVE AS WE NOW LOOK TO THE POST COVERED POSSIBLY IS WERE LOOKING TO THAT OPPOSED TO COPE ED ERA. AND SO WITH THAT I'D LOVE TO KIND OF OPEN THIS UP IS AS A DISCUSSION- WHICH IS A BIT DIFFERENT I THINK THAN OUR USUAL INFORMATIONAL HEARING SCHOOLS WILL SEE HOW IT GOES BUT- I'M WOULD JUST LOVE ADD TO GIVE EACH OF YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO TOUCH ON. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT WHAT YOU THINK ARE THE MOST CRITICAL CHALLENGES FACING OUR CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES AT RIGHT NOW AND A MISTER DANIELS WILL START START WITH YOU YES SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. IT'S A GREAT DAY YOU'RE DOING HEARING. I WELL ONE OF THE- BILL QUICKLY THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS FAMILY BUSINESS OF THE CAPITAL. BEFORE THE COVERED- IT BUSINESS CLOSURES. WE HAD ONE POINT FOUR MILLION FAMILY BUSINESSES IN THE STATE EMPLOYED ABOUT SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE. AND TO BE QUITE HONEST WITH YOU WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE NOW. OR HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYING- I DISAGREE WITH ONE THING THAT WAS SAID BY THE GENTLEMAN FROM OUT AT. L. A. O. AND THAT IS THAT- OF. PEOPLE BEING PAID MORE TO STAY HOME AND WORK HAS BEEN A HUGE PROBLEM. AT OUR MEMBERS TELLING ME THEY CAUGHT THEIR HR DEPARTMENT CALLS. EMPLOYEES AND SAYS HEY WE HAVE A JOB BACK THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LAID OFF. IN THE END THE TYPICAL RESPONSES. WHY MAKE IT MORE NOW THERE WAS WORKING FOR YOU WITH ALL THESE BENEFITS ARE COMING IN- MAYBE WATCH CALL ME BACK WHEN MY BENEFITS RUN OUT NOTE THINK ABOUT COMING BACK. AND IT'S AND IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE REPLACE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION. SO IT'S BEEN A HUGE PROBLEM AND OUR MEMBERS REPORTED TO ME. CONSTANTLY NOT JUST THOSE. TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO COME BACK TO WORK THE BUTTE PEOPLE TRYING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES SAME THING IS. THERE ARE THOSE SITTING AT HOME DOING REALLY WELL SO THEY DON'T GO OUT LOOK FOR JOBS. A FEW OTHER THINGS- THE PAGA LAWSUIT TO REALLY A PROBLEM FOR FAMILY BUSINESSES THAT'S THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY JONES ACT- I WOULD JUST LIKE IF YOU JUST GIVE ME A COUPLE STATEMENTS ON THAT. PAGA ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO SUE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE FOR ALMOST EVERY LABOR CODE VIOLATIONS AND IMPOSE A HUNDRED. DOLLAR FINE FOR THE FIRST VIOLATION AND TWO HUNDRED FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT VIOLATION. SO THE PAGO TURNER'S LOOK FOR COMPANIES WITH NUMEROUS EMPLOYEES SO I CAN DO CLASS ACTION SUITS. AND THESE CLAIMS HAVE GROWN MORE THAN TENFOLD SINCE THE LAW WAS CREATED. ATTORNEYS AVERAGING ABOUT FOUR AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CASE- AND THE- UNBELIEVABLY THE AVERAGE SETTLEMENT IS ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THESE PAGA SUIT. AND THERE ARE THINGS IS IT INVOLVED IN THE SUIT SIR IS SOLELY AS- YOUR CHECK DOESN'T EXACTLY SAY THE SAME THING IS WHO YOU THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE EMPLOYED BY. THAT THAT'S AN ACTUAL MEETING BEING BEEF- FINE FOR THAT AS AN EXAMPLE. SO THERE'S AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND INDUSTRIAL LINES THAT GATHERS DATA- I AM VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT. THE- EDT YOU REINSTATED THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE SEARCH FOR EMPLOYMENT EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS SOME OF THIS GETTING UNEMPLOYMENT HAS TO NOW AGAIN SHOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR LOOKING FOR WORK THAT WAS- PUT ASIDE FOR COVERED AND- OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THE PROBLEM. THEN THE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION HIS. THIS IS THE BOOK. THAT THE CHAMBER PUTS OUT JUST ON HR REGULATIONS IF YOU ARE THE BUSINESS OF THE STATE THERE'S OVER A THOUSAND PAGES YOU HAVE TO BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH YOU HAVE TO DO PERFECTLY YOU'RE PROBABLY STILL GET SUED. BUT THE BETTER YOU DO WITH THIS BOOK MAYBE OF YOUR JUDGE WILL BE A LITTLE LESS AND EVERY YEAR THIS GETS ADDED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS REALLY TO LEGISLATORS AND THE GOVERNOR IS A THOUSAND PAGES OF HR REGULATIONS REALLY NOT ENOUGH TO WE NEED MORE- I DON'T THINK SO IT'S ONE REASON CALIFORNIA HAS A HARD TIME COMPETING. WITH THE REST OF THE STATE'S. MOST OF OUR OTHER STATES WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING DON'T HAVE THIS I MEAN THEY HAVE SOMETHING BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THIS. AND THE OTHER BOILERMAKERS NOTHING EVER GOES AWAY IT JUST GETS ADDED. NOBODY EVER REALLY LOOKS IT'S AN SAYS. GOSH THAT'S ANTIQUATED AND WHY DO WE NEED OUR OR THIS REALLY REPLACE THAT OR THIS ON TOP OF THAT. SO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS DON'T HAPPEN JUST WHAT WE HAD. WHAT CAN WE DO TO- TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE GOAL BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. THEY ARE. I'M ALWAYS IN THE OTHER ON THE CAPITAL LONG TIME AND I'M ALWAYS. WARY OF THE LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. WHICH IS COMES FORTH IN ALMOST EVERY BILL AND EVERY INITIATIVE THAT THE PEOPLE PASS THERE IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE THAT HAPPENS AND A LOT OF TIMES I JUST OVERLOOKED ELASSONA MENTION IS THAT- C. T. FUNDING VOCATIONAL TRAINING WAS TO CALL FUNDING IS VERY CRITICAL- SO THAT UNSKILLED WORKERS COULD GET SOME SKILLS. I'M NOT EVERYBODY CAN GO TO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE PROGRAM NOT EVERYBODY REALLY WANTS TO AND THERE ARE A LOT OF JOBS THAT PAY QUITE WELL BUT YOU NEED SOME SKILLS TO GET THEM SO C. T. FUNDING IS SOMETHING THAT- IS VERY. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE STATE REALLY WASN'T DOING MUCH OF THEIR ALL. AND THAT WAS REALLY UNFORTUNATE. I DID ONE MAKE ONE OTHER POINT SO THE- U. I. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND DEBT NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S. TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS- AND THERE'S BEEN NO EFFORT TO. PAY BACK- THERE WAS A PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR THERE WAS A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL. I'M TOLD THAT BOTH DIED IN THE BUDGET PROCESS SO THERE'S WE'RE SAYING THAT WITH THIS HUGE DEBT TO THE GOVERNMENT. AND WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS IT'LL BE PASSED THROUGH TO BUSINESSES AS YET ANOTHER TAX. AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME. I THINK THERE'S SOME HOPE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MADE- FORGIVE IT BUT THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT MOST STATES WITH SMALLER DEBTS DID. IS IT TOOK SOME OF THE FEDERAL MONIES THAT WERE GIVEN TO THEM AND PAID OFF THEIR EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THAT- WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING REALLY GOOD TO DO. AND- THAT'S PROBABLY ENOUGH BUT- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THOSE POINTS. RIGHT THANK YOU AND THAT YES. YOU'VE GIVEN US IN FIVE CATEGORIES OF THINGS THAT I ACTUALLY WORK ARE ON MY LIST IN NEW WE WANTED TO DIVE INTO. GETTING THEIR SIMILAR SOME OF THAT THEY AT THE CHALLENGES THAT. THE OTHER PANELISTS ON THE LANDSCAPE SO BEFORE WE JUMP INTO THANKS IN. DEEPER CONVERSATION IN EACH OF THOSE ISSUES I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE. OUR OUR OTHER PANELISTS- AN OPPORTUNITY UP TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF. THE CHALLENGES- THAT THAT YOU SEE AS BEING. THE BIGGEST MOST CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES AND WE ALL GO BACK TO ADD TO IT TO YOU MS GRAY AND THEN. I. T. MR AND YES. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR- YOU KNOW MY OFFICES CHARGES TO RELEASE SUPPORT ECONOMIC. GROWTH AND- WE HAVE. FOUR VERY STILL. OBJECTIVE THAT I THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT. TO HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES AT THESE TIMES. YOU KNOW FIRST WE ARE RESOURCE PROVIDER WHICH YOU NOW WE ARE AN ADVOCATE AS OUR NAME IMPLIES WE ARE ADVANCING RESILIENCE AND BUILD ALL OF THOSE WERE REALLY- PRIOR TO MY COMING ON BOARD WE HAVE A FOURTH STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE DATA ON I AM BRINGING TO BEAR BASED UPON THE EXPERIENCE THAT. I'VE HAD THE LAST FOUR YEARS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS REALLY TO ADVANCE ECONOMIC MOBILITY WE HEARD IT FROM THAT- PRIOR PANELISTS ABOUT THE GAPS- IT BEAT THAT RACIAL AND ETHNIC GAPS BUT THERE ARE GAPS BASED ON GENDER AND ZIP CODE AS WELL. AND STILL I WANT TO MAKE SURE AND ONE OF THE REASONS I AM ADVANCING ON ECONOMIC MOBILITY AS ONE OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES THAT WE PREPARER- IN OUR ECOSYSTEM TO BE AS INCLUSIVE A SMALL BUSINESS ECOSYSTEM AS POSSIBLE AND TO CREATE CONTRACT READINESS TO UNLIMITED OPPORTUNITY GAPS ACROSS ZIP CODE RACE AND GENDER. AGAIN TO REALLY REMOVED THE BARRIERS THAT LEANED AL THAT WOMEN AND BI PAP BUSINESSES EXPERIENCE AS. STATE ATTEMPTED GROUT. I THINK WHAT WE SEEN IT IS. THAT THAT'S- FACING BUSINESS SAYS- FIRST SOME IT'S THE NEED TO PIVOT AND TO RETOOL RATE AS DIFFERENT NEEDS HAVE EMERGED IN THE MARKET PLACE CREATING OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER DIFFERENT GOODS AND SERVICES THIS INCLUDES A GREATER DEPENDENCE ON EASE SALES AND MARKETING WE SAW THAT GRAPH EARLIER. WITH THE ELECTRONIC SALES BEING OFF THE CHARTS- SO MUCH GREATER THAN- OTHER AREAS- FOR SOME OTHER BUSINESSES IT'S STRICTLY ABOUT RECOVERY AND CLOSING THE FINANCIAL GAPS THAT THE PANDEMIC CREATED AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT LIE. PUT CUSTOMER VOLUME ACCESS TO INVENTORY ROD THE- TRANSIT INTERRUPTIONS AND ACCESSIBILITY AND THOSE ARE ALL DIFFERENT- DEPENDING ON WHERE YOUR BUSINESS IS AND. WHAT BUSINESS YOU'RE IN. FOREIGN GROUP SMALL BUSINESS. IT'S BEYOND JUST RE OPENING AND IT'S REALLY MORE A BALLOT REIMAGINING BUSINESS ALTOGETHER I IT'S OUTSIDE OF THE PANDEMIC KNOW THAT 20% OF SMALL BUSINESSES FAIL IN THEIR FIRST YEAR. AND AT FIVE YEARS HALF OF THOSE NEW BUSINESSES WILL HAVE FAILED AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT THOSE SURVIVAL RATES ARE PRETTY MUCH EVEN ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES. AND THE PANDEMIC EXACERBATED AND THOSE TRENDS- WE SAW BETTER THAN 40% OF BLACK BUSINESSES CLOSED THEIR DOORS ALMOST 40% OF LATIN ACTS BUSINESSES AND OUR ASIAN COUNTERPARTS I'M SIGNIFICANT DECLINES AS WELL. BUT DUE TO THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE THROUGH STIMULUS LOANS GRANT UNEMPLOYMENT MANY OF THESE PROPRIETORS ARE LIKELY CONSIDERING THEIR OPTIONS RIGHT NOW FOR STARTING A NEW VENTURE AND RE IMAGINING WHAT THEY PREVIOUSLY FELT WAS THEIR FUTURE. SO I THINK THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES FACING OUR SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT OUR LEADERSHIP BOTH IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE ARE CREATING ACCESS TO PROGRAMS RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO HELP WITH ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AND OUR SMALL BUSINESS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NETWORK OF WHICH MR DANIEL IS A PART HAS INCREASED THEIR INTAKE WITH SMALL BUSINESSES TREMENDOUSLY AND MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR THE SMALL BUSINESSES APPLYING FOR THE RELIEF CRAP SO. I THINK IN IN IN CLOSING ON THIS QUESTION I REALLY WANT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE THE BACKBONE. TO CONTINUE THINKING CREATIVELY TO SUPPORT THIS NEXT PHASE OF RECOVERY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY. IN OUR NETWORK TO- REALLY GROW THE CAPACITY AND SCALE OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW THAT- MISTER JOURNALISTS GOING TO ARM RESPOND TO THE QUESTION SHORTLY- AND I JUST REALLY WANT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE AND THINK BECAUSE I WOULD REALLY BE LESS IF I DIDN'T. MENTION THE INCREDIBLE SERVICE- THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED DURING THIS VERY VERY STRESSFUL TIME FOR OUR SMALL BUSINESSES BY YOU AND OTHERS- IN OUR NETWORK. WHAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT MS GRAY AND DOES. WITH THAT AND MR VENICE MY ESTIMATES ARE DEAD OR ALIVE THERE ARE MANY AS YESTERDAY EN EL I'M- THANK YOU YEAH IT IS MIKE DANIELS I'M THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY INLAND EMPIRE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER NETWORK- I'M HERE REPRESENTING ALL OF THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS. ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- COMBINED WE ARE THE LARGEST BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT- ORGANIZATION IN THE COUNTRY WHERE SIXTY FIVE CENTERS WE HAVE ABOUT A THOUSAND CONSULTANTS WE ARE ALL BUSINESS OWNERS OR BUSINESS EXPERTS AND VERY DIFFERENT CAPACITIES WHETHER BE. RESTAURANT RETAIL HOSPITALITY AT THE FINANCIAL IT B. EQUITY AND DEBT CAPITAL- YOU KNOW- MARKETING THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE HELP BUSINESSES AND THE GREAT PART ABOUT OUR PROGRAM. IS THAT WERE FEDERALLY FUNDED AND WERE STATE FUNDED THROUGH- MISS GRAY'S OFFICE AS WELL SO THE SERVICE THAT WE PROVIDE COST ARE OUR CLIENTS ACTUALLY NOTHING- YOU KNOW AS WE'RE HELPING THEM. YOU KNOW AND IN THIS GREAT TALKED ABOUT THE PANDEMIC IN THE CALIFORNIA RELIEF GRANT. I THINK WE WERE THE FIRST ONES OUT OFFERING WEBINARS IT WAS TWO DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS- AND WE HAD. WE DID IT EVERY SINGLE DAY AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK- THE FIRST WEEK WE HAD OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE ATTEND- AND YOU SEE THE NEED TO WRITE THAT THEY NEED IS HUGE AND- I THINK THE FIRST PANEL DISCUSSED THE AVERAGE BUSINESS SIZE IT IS ROUGHLY FORTY FIVE EMPLOYEES. AND SO AS WE LOOK AT WHAT THEIR BIGGEST NEEDS ARE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU KNOW AS WE HEAR BIG BUSINESS AND RECOVERY IT'S NOT A FOR THE CASES WE LOOK AT SMALL BUSINESS AND I KIND OF BRING MYSELF INTO THIS AS WELL. I OWN A COUPLE ARE RECOGNIZED TALK FACTORIES ACTUALLY ONE IN YOUR DISTRICT- IN ONE L. A. COUNTY AND CANDY STORE AS WELL I THINK I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABSOLUTELY SO. YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK AT THE BIGGEST NEED FOR BUSINESS OWNERS IT IS DIFFERENT. BASED ON YOU KNOW THE REASON ALITY BASED ON THE BUSINESS BUSINESS TYPE BUT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS A VERY BIG PIECE OF WHAT BUSINESSES NEED- DIGIT DIGITAL DIVIDE IS ALSO ANOTHER PIECE THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT NOT NECESSARILY EXACTLY. THE SAME WAY THAT EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT JUST MOVING ON TO E. COMMERCE THAT IS THE SOLUTION FOR SOME BUT I FEEL FOR MOST BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY AN OPTION AND REALLY. WHAT THE DIVIDE IS YOU KNOW I MEAN HOW MAY OF US IN THIS ROOM. YOU KNOW WENT EIGHT AT EIGHT DINNER. NIGHT AT A REST. AND YOU TYPED IT INTO GOOGLE YOU KNOW YOU TYPED IN ITALIAN RESTAURANT NEAR ME. WELL THOSE BUSINESS OWNERS THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND THE TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE NOT THERE- MIKE ALL UP KIND OF BRING BACK WE TIED A PROGRAM IN SANTA ANA FOR THE BRIDAL SHOPS THERE FIFTEEN BOTTLE SHOPS AND CANTEMIR SHOPS. IN DOWNTOWN SANTA ANA THEY HAD NO DIGITAL PRESENCE WHATSOEVER SO IN THREE WEEKS. WE WENT IN AND TAUGHT THEM ONE ON ONE. AND IN A GROUP SETTING HOW TO ACTUALLY CREATE A DIGITAL PRESENCE WHICH- ISN'T THAT DIFFICULT BUT FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE THAT SKILL SET IT IS- THERE. THERE THEY WERE DRIVING TRAFFIC THE TRAFFIC WAS UP SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. AFTER THEY WERE ABLE TO JUST FIND THEM RIGHT I MEAN YOU COULD BEEN STANDING IN FRONT OF ONE OF THE DRESS SHOP IS THAT. IT CAN SENIOR ADDRESS. AND THEY WOULDN'T COME UP YOU KNOW SO MAKING SURE THAT THAT'S THAT'S UNDERSTOOD- LEASES ARE A BIG DEAL. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BRICK AND MORTAR LEASE- IT'S- MY- BUSINESSES WERE NOT GIVEN A BASEMENT FLOOR. YOU KNOW REDUCED RENT THEY WERE GIVEN DEFERMENT SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS. YOU KNOW IF I'M PAYING BUT I PAY TEN DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT. AND I THE AVERAGE STORE IZE OF THE THOUSAND THOUSAND SQUARE FEET AND PAYING TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IN RENT. WELL I GOT THAT DIFFERED FOR SIX MONTHS OR TWELVE MONTHS NOW THAT I'M PAYING FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IN RENT. TO THINK ABOUT THE- EXTRA EXPENSE AN EXTRA REVENUE I HAVE TO DRIVE. JUST TO BREAK EVEN. AND THAT'S WHERE MOST BUSINESS OWNERS ARE AT RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE FIRM IS NOW COMING DUE. AND SO I THINK WE HAVEN'T SEEN WHAT COMMERCIAL LEASE IS GOING TO DO. WITH WHERE WE'RE AT AND- YOU KNOW. WITH ACCESS TO CAPITAL ME WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE MARKET IS I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF GRANT PROGRAMS AND PPP AND- IDLE. BUT AS THOSE START TO SUBSIDE AND GO AWAY. WHAT IS NEXT AND THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. AND THE AT THE AVERAGE CAPITAL NEED FOR A SMALL BUSINESS IS LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND IT YOU CAN ACCESS THAT RIGHT SOME OF THE LARGER BANKS DON'T WANT TO DO THAT KIND OF A LOAN. BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY IN IT FOR THEM TO SERVICE THAT. I'M NOT GET IT TO TWO MORE THINGS AND STOP- SUPPLY ISSUES ARE A HUGE DEAL. WHEN I JUST BRING IT BACK TO MYSELF- I. ORDER FROM ONE OF THE LARGEST TRUCKING MANUFACTURERS IN THE COUNTRY AND I ORDERED A THOUSAND POUNDS OF CHOCOLATE TWO WEEKS AGO. AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY. RIGHT SO IMAGINE YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW NOT BEING ABLE TO GET YOUR SUPPLY TO ACTUALLY MAKE WHAT YOU NEED TO. AND THEN THE WORK FORCE ESPECIALLY TALK ABOUT RESTAURANT RETAIL AND HOSPITALITY. THAT IS WHERE THE WORKFORCE NEED IS. AND WHEN YOU'RE COMPETING WITH UNEMPLOYMENT. WHEN YOU'RE COMPETING WITH THINGS AND IT'S EASIER TO. TO STAY ON UNEMPLOYMENT THE WAY. IT MAKES IT A DIFFICULT- OPTION TO DO TO FIND EMPLOYEES I MEAN. I'M TO THE POINT WHERE I NEED THE INTERVIEW YOU JUST COME IN AND START WORKING. RIGHT AND THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF BUSINESS OWNERS ARE AT ITS COMPETITIVE NOW. WITH YOU THERE'S IT'S NOT. A NOT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WORK FORCE AT THE MOMENT. SOME OF. THERE AND- OKAY ALL RIGHT SO YOU'RE YOU'VE GIVEN US COLLECTIVELY A LOT TO IT TO DIVE INTO FOR THE NEXT SAID TWENTY MINUTES OR SO I'M AND ACTUALLY LET'S START WHERE WHERE YOU ENDED LET'S PICK UP ON THIS THIS QUESTION OF AB WORK FORCE AND AS WE SIGN THAT THE EARLIER PANEL AND WE CONTINUE TO READING AND HEADLINE NEWS I THINK ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY- THAT THERE IS. THERE'S JUST BEEN INCREDIBLY SLOW RETURNED TO WORK- IN MANY SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY AND I THINK PART OF THAT- WE RESPONDED IN CERTAIN WAYS TO THIS UNPRECEDENTED SHOCK OF THE COVER NINETEEN CRISIS I GUESS MY QUESTION IS AND I THINK WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THAT IS GOING TO STABILIZE OVER TIME- AT MR YOU ARE FROM THE ALEJO'S. KIND OF TRADE OFF. THE OTHER PROVIDED A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION TODAY THAN THEY DID MAYBE IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY- FOR MANY JOBS A LOT OF THOSE- I THINK THERE'S TRADE OFFS WE'LL START TO STABILIZE QUITE NATURALLY I THINK IN AND NOT IN LIKE A YEAR IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS I GUESS DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT OR DO YOU YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE- SOME. THE LAST SCENE I GUESS IT HAS THERE BEEN A LASTING SHOCKED TO. THE LABOR MARKET- THAT. CAUSES A- PROLONGED CONCERN AND WARRANTS I GUESS AND YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF AN INTERVENTION OR EARLY SECOND LONGER TERM CONSIDERATIONS. HELLO QUESTION DO WE THINK IT'S A SHORT TERM ISSUE THAT. IS GOING TO GET RESOLVED BY THAT JUST FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND COMING INTO EQUILIBRIUM OR IS THERE SOMETHING LONGER TERM THAT WE ALL NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT. AND I WOULD SAY A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH- THERE ARE PEOPLE ARE RELUCTANT GO BACK TO WORK THAT HAVE BEEN ORKING FROM HOME. THEY LIKE TO WORK FROM HOME FOREVER FACT ONE- THE STUDY I SAW SAID THAT- IF THERE IS SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO WOULD BE OFFERED A THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE TO COME BACK TO WORK. FULL TIME IN THE OFFICE AND THEY THEY'D RATHER NOT THAT RATHER STAY HOME AND NOT GET THE PAY. SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE THAT'S HAPPENING- I DO THINK WHEN THE- PROGRAMS ARE PAYING MORE TO STAY HOME- MORE TO STAY HOME WITH THOSE FOR. IN DISPOSED AN EXCERPT. IF THEY'RE NOT PUT BACK INTO. A PLACE I THINK THAT'LL HELP TREMENDOUSLY BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO GO BACK TO WORK IN AND GET A JOB. SO THERE IS A- THERE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN A CHANGE IN PEOPLE'S OUTLOOKS. ON HOW TO WORK AND HOW THEY WORK IT IS CENTRAL- BUT I THINK THEY'RE ALSO A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY S. AND GET BACK TO WORK. BECAUSE THEY MISS THE- YOU KNOW COOLER TALK IN THE SIT AROUND THE OFFICE AND TALK ABOUT IDEAS AND- YOU JUST DON'T GET THAT. WHEN EVERYBODY'S REMOTE AND- THAT THAT HAS BEEN MISSING FOR LAST YEAR. SO AS I SAID I THINK THERE'S SOME OF BOTH. OKAY MISTER DANIEL YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK THAT WE WILL SEE- A HYBRID ENVIRONMENT MOVING FORWARD. I'M BUT I THINK THAT THE JOBS NUMBERS THAT WERE RELEASED IN IN JUNE I BELIEVE- WE ADDED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS. IN CALIFORNIA SO I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY. THAT THERE IS A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS. AND EMPLOYMENT AND I THINK IT'S STILL OPTIMISTIC. I WITH A COSTLY OPTIMISTIC YOU KNOW I WAS GOING TO BE COOLER I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NOW RIGHT IN THE WITHOUT BUSINESSES CLOSE DOWN COMPLETELY FOR THREE MONTHS AND I THINK THAT HAS TAUGHT PEOPLE TO BE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT- YOU KNOW AND MAYBE WITH LESS WORK FORCE TRYING TO DO MORE. AND SO I'M HOPEFUL BUT YOU KNOW THE SLOWEST RECOVERY MARKET IS THE RESTAURANT RETAIL HOSPITALITY BECAUSE THOSE ARE THEJOBS THAT YOU KNOW ARE LESS ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE OF THE WAGE. YOU KNOW AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP HELP SUPPORT THOSE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. IN GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK- IN ANA I GUESS I SURE THAT LATER- THEY'RE THEY'RE HAVING HIM EMPLOYERS. HAVE ACTUALLY. BEEN SO PRETTY SURE THE PEOPLE STAYING WITH THEM AND WORKING LIKE IN GROCERY STORES ETCETERA. AS AN EXAMPLE- SOMEBODY SENT ME THIS FOOD RETAILERS- INCREASE PAYROLL INCENTIVE PAY AND BENEFITS BY SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR. TO SHOW THEIR APPRECIATION WHO EMPLOYS FOR WORKING IN PERSON THROUGH THE PANDEMIC. I DON'T KNOW WE HAVE SOME GROCERY STORE MEMBERS. AND THEY'VE- EXACTLY DONE THAT I MEAN THEY HAVE SAID THANK YOU AND WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU EXTRA MONEY FOR BEING HERE. REALLY APPRECIATE FACTOR HERE SET FOR TETRIS SO. THAT'S HAPPENING TO IT'S A GOOD THING. MMHM I ALSO IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR- WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER. OF BUDGET ITEMS- THAT I THINK WILL GO A LONG WAY. TOWARDS STIMULATING- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN IN TERMS OF WORKFORCE. WE HAVE OF COURSE AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS CODE NINETEEN RELIEF. GRANT WHICH WOULD BRING THAT TOTAL INVESTMENT FOR BILLION. BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE CALIFORNIA DREAM FIND. WHICH IS A SMALL BUSINESS- START UP GRANT PROGRAM. THAT WILL MAKE UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. THAT HAVE COMPLETED- AND APPROVED ENTREPRENEUR SMALL BUSINESS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM. THAT OUR PARTNERS ALIKE MR DANIEL SPOKE OF EARLIER. ALREADY OFFERING. I'M AND WE THINK THAT THAT WILL HELP WITH THE START UP THEN OBVIOUSLY BUSINESSES NEED FOLKS. TO HELP THEM. PRODUCE THEIR GOODS AND GET THEM OUT INTO THE MARKETPLACE. ALSO WE HAVE OUR I HAVE SQUARED PROGRAM- WE PLAN TO RELAUNCH THIS PROGRAM. WITH A TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA INNOVATION HUBS. AND THAT WE ARE HOPING TO INCENTIVIZE INCLUSIVE DIVERSE. AND EQUITABLE. INNOVATION ACTIVITIES IN THIS THE TAX AND SOME BE- STARTED ECO. THEREBY BE. OF THE OVERALL COULD. FOR INNOVATION ACROSS THE STATE. WE'VE GOT A LIVE- THEN YOU GRANTS PROGRAM AIMED AT CLOSING THE FINANCIAL GAP FOR LIKE VENUE OPERATORS WITH GRANTS UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TWENTY PERCENT. OF THEIR TWENTY NINETEEN ANNUAL GROSS REVENUE AND THEN TO- THAT MEMBER CARILLO THIS POINT ABOUT THE SMALLEST BUSINESS SAYS I'M IN THE STATE WE HAVE A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. MICRO BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM THAT'S AIMED AT REACHING THE SMALLEST OF THE SMALL BUSINESS SAYS WHAT LESS THAN FIVE EMPLOYEES AND UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUE. AND SO WE HOPE TO- REALLY PARTNER WITH- ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO HELP THEM MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR CONSTITUENCY AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO BRING. THESE KINDS OF RESOURCES SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE A NONPROFIT PERFORMING ARTS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GRANT- PROGRAM THAT WILL BE- THAT WORKING TO CREATE WORKFORCE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE ARTS AND- THAT WOULD BE THROUGH A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ON INVESTMENT SO. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO OUR SMALL BUSINESSES- IN AN EFFORT TO HELP THEM COME. BACK STRONGER THAN BEFORE. THANK YOU YES THANK YOU FOR HAVING A AND ESPECIALLY THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING AND I'M GOING TO FORGET WHAT. AT WHAT WE'RE WE'RE CALLING ABOUT THE AD THAT THE FUNDING TO CREATE. INNOVATION ECOSYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE I THINK THAT THAT IS SO CRITICAL AND I THINK THERE'S A REALLY REALLY SOME EXCITING OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO CREATE THESE THESE REGIONAL CENTERS OF GROWTH AND INNOVATION- AN OPPORTUNITY SO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT AND POTENTIALLY EVEN DIVING INTO THAT MORE I THINK IN. IN IN AS A TOPIC FOR ONE OF OUR FUTURE HEARINGS BUT I WANT TO PICK UP ON- WHAT WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND I KNEW THAT MR MANY AS YOU MENTIONED. AS THE NEED FOR MORE CURRENTTECHNICAL EDUCATION FUNDING I THINK THAT'S WHAT WHICH WERE WERE GETTING AT- AND I GUESS TWO QUESTIONS. ARE WE INVEST IN IT AS AS A STATE FARM ARE WE INVESTING ENOUGH IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND CTE PROGRAMS. WHAT MORE DO WE NEED TO DO AND HOW WOULD YOU DIRECT ADDITIONAL DOLLARS AND I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR PERSPECTIVES FROM EVERYONE YEAH MISTER GRANULOCYTE SORRY YEAH SURE WE'RE ACTUALLY RUNNING A PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH- WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND WE'RE DO EVERYTHING CANCERS OFFICE IN IN SACRAMENTO. AND WE'RE DOING IT ATAQUE COVERED COPPER MOUNTAIN COLLEGE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TAKING STUDENT INTERNS AND THEY'RE BEING PAID BY THE COLLEGE AND THEY'RE DOING A TEN WEEK INTERNSHIP WITH WITH BUSINESS OWNERS TEACHING THEM. A LOT OF THESE DIGITAL PRESENCE PIECES RIGHT THERE BUILDING YOU KNOW SCO TO BUILDING WEBSITES FOR THEM THEY'RE THEY'RE DRIVING TRAFFIC TO THEIR BUSINESSES AND I THINK THAT SOME OF THAT IS THE CATALYST OF JOB THE NEXT JOBS OF THE FUTURE AND MAKING SURE THAT. THAT YOU KNOW TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT THE FOUR UNIVERSITIES ARE ALL TIED IN TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE JOBS ARE AND THEN TRAINING THEM. EDUCATION IS ONE THING BUT THE OTHER PART IS THE EXPERIENCE OF LEARNING AND I THINK WHEN YOU CAN TIED DIRECTLY INTO WORKING WITH BUSINESS. OWNERS WHAT AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY. I'D GET AGREE THAT CAN COLLEGE GREAT FOR. IN IN THEIR- AROUND THE STATE- I SPENT SEVEN YEARS ON THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SYSTEM AND I SO I GOT TO SEE OF MANY MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROGRAMS. AND A GREAT AND A BAND THE STUDENTS GET OUT AND I GET. MUCH BETTER PAYING JOBS THAT WOULD HAVE BEFORE- AND SO THERE'S ALWAYS THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH FUNDING TO THAT OBVIOUSLY. AND THEN AT THE K. TWELVE LEVEL THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL- THEY'LL SHOP PROGRAMS MANY OF THEM JUST BEEN ABANDONED. AND THERE'S NO MONEY FOR THEM AND ACTUALLY THE BUILDING INDUSTRY HAS A PROGRAM CALLED BEEN A- WHICH- USES PRIVATE FUNDING. TO GO IN AND GET THE SHOP PROGRAMS PUT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN SO- STUDENTS CAN LEARN CARPENTRY AND- WELDING AND DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT. IN HIGH SCHOOL AND GET A JOB WHEN THEY'RE DONE. SO YES THERE'S REALLY NEVER ENOUGH BUT YES THE MORE THE BETTER PUT IT pLIKE YOU SAID I THINK THERE ARE SOME GREAT. EXAMPLES ACROSS THE STATE END. UP WANTING I. WOULD LOVE TO PRESS TWO X. COLLECTIVELY FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IS. IDENTIFY THOSE EXAMPLES THAT ARE WORKING REALLY WELL AND IN ONE REGION AND- BE ABLE TO ROLL THAT OUT ACROSS THE STATE AS- BEST PRACTICES- AND- BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THERE'S THAT. A PROGRAM- AT ONE OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT SAID THE BUILDING TRADES HAVE PARTNERED WITH THAT THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT. I HAD TO RUN A PROGRAM IN HIGH SCHOOL AND IT HAS BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS. AND IT YOU KNOW CREATING. THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE RIGHT UP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL TO STEP INTO. GOOD PAYING HIGHLY SKILLED AND TRAINED JOBS AND- YEAH SO URINE'S CONTRABAND ACTUALLY HAS STARTED AND IS NOW STATEWIDE- SO IS IT REALLY A PIONEER YEAH. THAT WONDERFUL WONDERFUL PROGRAM YES AND OTHER THOUGHT SENT- IS GREAT ON ON WORK FOR YOU EVEN HAD TOUCHED A LITTLE BIT ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D ADD ON WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT OR C. T. FUNDING. WELL YES IF I MAY I'M I THINK THAT THE PROGRAM THAT- WITH THE TRADES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. TO REASONS- IT GIVE THIS UP- RELIEF I THINK OF FOR- KIDS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE GO INTO DEBT. PURSUING A FOUR YEAR DEGREE. I AM NOT NECESSARILY EARN UP MORE- IT GIVES THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET VERY- WELL PAYING. JOBS BUT OF COURSE TOMORROW AREA OF EXPERTISE BUT ALSO MAKE EXCELLENT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. TRADESMEN AND WOMEN AND SO WHAT I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED. IN THE TRADES AND GETTING MORE. SOONER FASTER BETTER THREE TRADE SCHOOLS AND THROUGH THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IN ALMATY INDUSTRY. BECAUSE I THINK WE ARE SEEING A GAP AS MR RUBIN IS SET. WITH HIGH SCHOOLS DOING AWAY WITH THAT- IT IS JUST BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DRAIN A AND- WE'RE- VERY QUICKLY MOVING TO A PLACE WHERE WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH TRADES PEOPLE- SO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. I THINK IN ORDER TO STEM THAT TIDE. CAN YOU MADE A GREAT POINT ABOUT- TRADES PEOPLE BECOMING A BUSINESS PEOPLE- HOMEBUILDING HAS BECOME KIND OF A CORPORATE- INDUSTRY A LOT OF THE BIG BUILDERS YOU KNOW. PROBABLY THE PRIVATE 40% OF THE PRODUCT 50% NOW BUT- THE TRADE CONTRACTORS ALMOST ALL HOMEGROWN. IS STARTED OUT THEIR TRADE IS A FRAME OR A CARPENTER OR- WHATEVER. AND STARTED A SMALL BUSINESS SOME GOTTEN VERY BIG. BUT TYPICALLY THERE'S THEY'RE ABOUT TO TWENTY SOME SUBCONTRACTORS TRADE CONTRACTS WITH EACH JOB. AND MOST OF THOSE ARE EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID. YEAH WELL AND I THINK THE OTHER ANOTHER POINT IN IT SO MUCH BACK TO THE DIGITAL EVERYONE ONE ASPECT THE JUST TO FILTER BY IT WILL BE TALK ABOUT. WORK FORCE TO. AND EMPHASIZE JUST HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS THE PRE PANDEMIC WE WERE SEEN CALIFORNIA'S JOB GROWTH NUMBERS AND I'M NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING YOU DON'T NOW BUT YOU ARE JOB WITH NUMBERS WERE SLOWING. NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE WEREN'T HIRING BUT BECAUSE INCREASINGLY THE SKILLS OF OUR LABOR FORCE ARE OUT OF STEP WITH WHAT IS NEEDED AND ARE INCREASINGLY TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN ECONOMY AND- I THINK THE BETTER JOB THAT WE CAN DO AS- AS POLICY MAKERS. AT CONNECTING THOSE DOTS ARE THE BETTER IT'S GOING TO BE FOR CALIFORNIANS AND CERTAINLY THAT THE BETTER IT'S GOING TO BE FOR CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC OUT LONG TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH PROSPECTS. YES ANOTHER IMPORTANT IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT IS IN FACT IT'S ON THAT WE'VE GOT IT HEY AT HEARING THAT IS GONNA FOCUS ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- SCHEDULED FOR LATER IN THE YEAR. I'M I DO WANNA NOW BRIEFLY JUMPED INTO AT THIS THE- CONVERSATION ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND- I THINK IT WAS. AB JAKOB ON QUESTS THAT HAD HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS I KNOW THAT IT IS WHAT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CENTERS AND A BIG PART OF WHAT OF WHAT YOU DO. AND AGAIN THERE. ARE THERE ARE THERE PIECES THAT ARE MISSING ARE THERE ARE THERE THINGS THAT IS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE SIDE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE S. OUTSIDE DOING DIFFERENTLY ARE DOING MORE OF SURE SURE AND I THINK- YOU KNOW THAT THE PANDEMIC IS DEFINITELY TAUGHT US A LOT ABOUT THIS. AND JUMPED IN AND SUPPORTED THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS I BELIEVE YOU GRANT EIGHTY SIX DIFFERENT GRANTEES- FUNDING YOU KNOW MOST OF THESE ARE ALL FEDERAL PROGRAMS AS WELL SO THERE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING. COMING IN AND I THINK AS WE'VE SEEN. JUST THAT NEED FOR TIGHTENING ASSISTANCE COULD BE UNDERSTAND FINANCIAL THAT COULD BE. HIGHER IT COULD THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS RIGHT MARKETING DIFFERENT DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT INTERNATIONAL TRADE PROCUREMENT AND THAT'S ONE THING WE HAVEN'T REALLY DISCUSSES PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES AT THE STATE LEVEL. THE LOCAL LEVEL- YOU KNOW I THINK ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS DEFINITELY NEEDED AND I THINK. MAKING SURE THAT. WE ARE REACHING EVERYBODY RIGHT I MEAN I THINK YOU HEARD FROM ASSEMBLY WOMAN CARILLO. MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW THE SMALLEST OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE REACHED IN THE LANGUAGE THEY NEED TO BE REACHED IN IN THE AREA THAT THEY NEED TO BE REACHED TO. YOU KNOW I THINK WE LEARNED A LOT FROM THAT CALIFORNIA RELIEF GRANT OF THAT WE WERE DOING IN TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. AND THE ATTENDANT DIDN'T CHANGE YOU KNOW IT'S JUST I MEAN PEOPLE ON HERE THEY NEED TO HEAR IT IN THEIR LANGUAGE WE NEED IT TO BE HANDS ON. AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS JUST THAT RIGHT. SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE FROM YOU HELPING YOU DO IT HANDS ON AND I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S THE ABILITY AND I THINK THAT THAT SYSTEM ALREADY EXISTS. I THINK GROWING AND EXPANDING IT IS REALLY WHAT'S NEEDED. AND I FEEL LIKE I SO OFTEN FIND IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ACTUALLY EVEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR LOCAL CHAMBERS. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHO THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AND THAT THE A CONTINUAL CHALLENGES YOU HAVE FIGURED OUT SO THAT I'D LOVE TO THE STORY THAT YOU SHARED ABOUT THAT THE SMALL- DRESS SHOP. THAT AFTER A FEW HOURS OF JUST BASICALLY LEARNING HOW TO LAST THERE ARE AT THEIR SHOP ON. I SUPPOSE I COULD LADDERS NINE ABLE TO INCREASE THEIR BUSINESS BY 75% OF PEOPLE COULD FIND THEM. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SOME THINGS THAT ARE TRANSFORMATIVE IT'S NOT SIX MONTHS OF EFFORT AND ALL KINDS OF MONEY THAT WE HAVE TO INVEST. IT'S THAT LITTLE BIT OF HELP AT THE RIGHT MOMENT AND MAKING SURE THAT. DRESS SHOP OWNERS ACROSS THE STATE UNDERSTAND HE THERE'S HELP AVAILABLE YEAH WE CAN HELP YOU YES TAKE THAT FIRST STEP INTO THE DIGITAL DIVIDE YEAH IT'S- TACTICAL AND YOU KNOW TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AT SUCH AN ODD NAME RIGHT I MEAN. YOU REALLY DEFINE WHAT THAT MEANS AND I THINK WHAT IT IS AND- MAYBE I NEED FINANCING YOU KNOW MAYBE I NEED. YOU KNOW BETTER HELP IN MY MARKETING I JUST NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS SO I KNOW WHAT I'M MEASURING. NEED MAYBE BE SHOT MAYBE WOULDN'T OF JUST YOU KNOW. WHAT CAN BE TAUGHT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO BUSINESS OWNERS SO THAT THEY CAN BE YOU KNOW THEY CAN GENERATE MORE REVENUE HIRE MORE PEOPLE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE THEM BETTER BUSINESS OWNERS. AND TO MISTAKEN YOU SPEAK UP IT TOO WHAT WITH GO BIZ AND WHAT WHAT YOU ALL ARE DOING TO AT. GET THESE COMMUNICATIONS OUT ACROSS CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND ALSO SPEAK TO ANY WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN. CAN HELP PARTNER WITH YOU ON THAT. YES SO AS IN MISTER ACT DANIEL SAID EARLIER MADAM CHAIR. AND WE DO HAVE MORE THAN EIGHTY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- PROVIDERS NOW. WE ARE EMBARKING ON EXPANDING WITH THE DREAM FINE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- NETWORK TO INCLUDE. NON PROFITS- SO THAT WE CAN EXPAND THE REACH AND- HELP THAT WE ARE PROVIDING TO SMALL BUSINESSES. I WANT TO GO BACK- IF I NAY TO MISTER DANIELS POINTED ABOUT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE KIND OF BEING AN AUDIT NAME AND- I HAVE A LIGHT CAN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS TO CLINICIANS. YOU KNOW WHEN A WHEN A SMALL BUSINESS PERSON SENSE IT'S ALMOST AS IF COMING INTO THE ER. SOMEBODY HAS TO TRIAGE AND REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THAT SMALL BUSINESS WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATE. AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE PLACED A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON ACCESS TO CAPITAL. AND IT'S APPROPRIATE. IT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED IT IS WELL KNOWN. THAT ACCESS TO CAPITAL IS MATHIS. HOW IT IS ALSO. AS DOCUMENTED AND WHILE NOW. THAT WITHOUT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE CAPITAL IS NOT APPROPRIATELY USE ONCE RECEIVED. AND SO I THINK WE ARE RESPONSE OUR POLICY RESPONSE ARE BUDGET RESPONSE. HAS TO BE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES IF WE ARE GOING TO ORGANICALLY GROW OUR SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE BROUGHT TO GROW THE NETWORK THAT PROVIDES THE ASSISTANCE TO THEM. IT SHOULD ABSOLUTELY IT'S JUST. BIGELOW HAND IN HAND. THANKS I THINK THAT'S A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT POINT. AND THAT MAKE MOVING ON I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME TIME TO YOU- DIVE INTO A TOPIC THAT YOU I'M PRODUCT MR RUBIN YES WHICH IS. CALIFORNIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE THAT- BOB AND ARLENE I THINK IT IS IT NOW FORTY BILLION DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR TWENTY THREE DEPENDING ON WHO YOU TALK TO AND GROWING YES OF. AB AND I'M I'M GUESSING ACTUALLY THE STAGE THAT WE'RE NOT HEARING ABOUT THIS FROM. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. THAT THIS WORK YOU KNOW THIS IS COMING BUT ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE YOU HEARD OF GUESS HELD A LAST HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS FROM FROM POP SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ABSOLUTELY NOT RIGHT THIS IS NOT ON THEIR RADAR GET YOU KNOW IT'S MORE JUST SURVIVAL RECOVERY RIGHT THERE THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE AT THE MOMENT AND EVEN PRIOR PANDEMIC. RIGHT INTERMENT MISTER VAN YES I THINK TIMES WE ALL HEAR THESE REALLY BIG YOU KNOW MULTI BILLION DOLLAR NUMBERS AND IT IT'S XT. OUR ARMS AROUND SO CAN YOU HELP MAKE THIS RESULT FOR. FINALLY KNOW THAT IT'S A BUSINESS OWNER WHO'S DOING I'VE- GOT MY HEART RATE OF A- MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE A YEAR. SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHAT WHAT WOULD WHAT IMPACT IS THIS GOING TO HAVE ON THEM WELL THIS IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY BECAUSE- IT DEPENDS ON HOW THEY WOULD DECIDE TO PAY IT BACK. AND WHAT THEY MIGHT DO- AS I SAID THAT I THINK THERE'S SOME HOPE AND IN MANY FRONTS THAT- SOME I LIKE A BUILD UP BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THEY HAVE ACTUALLY GOT ENOUGH TO PAY IT BACK WITH A CHOSE TO SPEND ON OTHER THINGS THEY'VE BEEN. I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND CERTAINLY LEGISLATURE. SO IT'S VERY HARD TO SAY- WHAT WOULD ULTIMATELY HAPPEN I KNOW WE HAD A TEN BILLION DOLLAR DEBT AT ONE TIME. WE FINALLY GOT IT PAID OFF AND PART OF IT WAS PAID OFF BUT WAS BY HIGHER PAYROLL TAX BUT I CAN'T TELL EXACTLY. WHAT WENT UP BUT- THAT'S ANOTHER FOR YOUR BILL BUSINESSES DO UNDERSTAND THEY'RE GOING TO GET THIS OUR MEMBERS KNOW BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT IN A NEWSLETTER. BUT JUST- ONE MORE TAX INCREASE TO WORRY ABOUT. BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT WOULD BE A HAVE AN ACCENT AND I SHOULD'VE I HAD. SOME EXAMPLES I KNEW THAT THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE HAD DONE A COUPLE SIDES WERE- THEY MAPPED OUT AND THAT A SCENARIO FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESS BUT- I THINK THAT THE- THE PUNCH LINE REALLY IS KIND OF ABSENT ANY. INTERVENTION OR ACTION. THAT THIS WILL FALL AS A BURDEN ON CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES AND THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS PAYROLL TAXES. INCREASE A LITTLE BIT EVERY SINGLE YEAR- TO TAKE COVER THE COST UNTIL THE DEBT IS PAID OFF AND THE EXPECTATION WOULD BETHAT THOSE INCREASES. I WOULD. WOULD BE IN PLACE FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS IN ORDER FOR US TO PAY OFF THIS THIS BALL- SO I KNOW I AM. THIS IS. A FULL DISCLOSURE I'M ADVOCATING. IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE DO TAKE SOME ACTION. TO ADDRESS THIS I THINK. I WE- THE NINETY WAS AN PRESIDENT I CAN SHOCK AND WE HAVE STEPPED UP AND STEPPED IN. TO FILL THE GAPS IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS- I THINK IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE IF WE DON'T. STEP UP IN THIS REGARD. I GUESS- MS GRAYER IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU ALL ARE TALKING ABOUT OR THAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT FROM. BUSINESSES LARGE OR SMALL- AS WE START TO COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC I YOU KNOW I HAVE TO BE HONEST IT HAS NOT BEEN ON THE RADAR YAK OKAY. ON THE AND I AM STILL- AND THERE ARE THINGS I AM STILL GETTING MY ARMS AROUND IN THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THEM. YEP WHAT I THINK IS THERE WAS THERE WAS CERTAINLY AS YOU SAID MR EVAN YES THERE WAS A HOPE THAT THE FEDS WOULD. ADD CLOSE THAT GAP- I THINK AND- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S ONLY EIGHTEEN STATES THAT ACTUALLY DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF. I YOU I DEBT RIGHT NOW SAYS THAT- THAT HOPE IS PROBABLY. NOT GOING TO BE REALIZED ON THAT THE FEDS ARE GOING TO. PAY OFF OUR- YEAH THE EIGHT DAYS AND POINT OUT OF EIGHTEEN STATES WHEN. OTHERS DON'T HAVE THAT NEEDS- SO I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE AT A CALIFORNIA CHALLENGE AND SOMETHING THAT WE DO NEED TO. I'M TO TAKE REALLY SERIOUSLY AND THE REASON I THINK I'M- RAISING IT IN THIS CONTEXT IS. ULTIMATELY IT WILL BECOME I THINK IT'S AN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGE FOR CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS. WERE YOU ON BRUCE WERE YOU A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER DURING THAT POST TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. AND WHAT WAS WORK FOR YOUR SORT OF RISING PAYROLL TAXES TO PAY OFF YOU AYE SOMETHING THAT YOU NOTICE FOR THAT I CAN'T SAY THAT IT WOULD BEEN SUMMIT OKAY INTERESTING OKAY THAT'S THAT IS THAT'S- INTERESTING. HI I'M OKAY MOVING MOVING ON. I'M I'M JUST THINKING DRIVE TOUCHED ON ALL OF THE- PIC ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED. WHY WOULD YOU SAY I'M ACTUALLY GONNA PICK UP ON AND ONE LAST THING- STRANGLE THAT YOU STARTED TO GO INTO WHICH WAS PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES- YEAH- WE LIKE TO SAY MORE ABOUT THAT AND MORE ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN I GUESS INCREASE PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE SURE ABSOLUTELY I THINK SO YOU KNOW SMALL BUSINESSES MINORITY BUSINESSES BETTER BUSINESSES THIS IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO REALLY. SET PRESIDENT I BELIEVE THERE'S A COUPLE BILLS AND MAYBE YOU KNOW THEM I DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW THE NUMBER OFF HAND- BUT TO PUT A MINIMUM PERCENTAGE OF DOLLARS THAT GO TO SMALL BUSINESSES THAT THAT ARE BEING PROCURED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR EVERY DEPARTMENT AND EVERY AGENCY THAT YOU KNOW HAD MORE OF A 25% MANDATE VERSUS I THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S HOPE THAT IT GETS TO TWENTY FIVE IT REALLY KIND OF SETTING THAT PRECEDENT. AND THAT'S VERY COMMON WITH FEDERAL CONTRACTING- YOU KNOW UNTIL IT GOES TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND THEY HAVE A PREFERENCE IN THAT AND I THINK THOSE ARE SOME BIG OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY HELP SOLIDIFY IN SECURE SMALL BUSINESS FOR THE FUTURE AND IT'S YOU KNOW THE STATE'S ALREADY SPENDING THE MONEY YOU KNOW BUT HELP SUPPORT THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AS WELL. YES AND MY COLLEAGUE AT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU HAS INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ACTUALLY WOULD CODIFY THAT 25% OUR GOAL A MAN I'M A CO AUTHORS ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS SIZE SELECT COMMITTEE ON BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY MORE THAT WE CAN DO BUT I THINK THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT. IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. I SO BEFORE YOU. UP OUR- DISCUSSION. AND ED TRANSITION TO IT TO PUBLIC COMMENT. WOULD LIKE TO JUST ASK EACH OF YOU TO TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY AS TO YOU TWO THINGS NUMBER ONE. I'M ANY OTHER IMPORTANT POINTS THAT THAT WE FAIL TO TOUCH ON THAT IF. YOU'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT BEFORE WE WRAP UP. AND NUMBER TWO IF THERE WAS JUST ONE THING. NOW ONE THING. THAT YOU COULD HAVE THE CALPERS LEGISLATURE DO TOMORROW BUT WOULD HAPPEN. TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS. AND I'LL START WITH DUSTER WITH YOU IT'S GOOD FOR HER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO JUST STEP BACK AND HIGHLIGHT THAT MY OFFICE IS CURRENTLY- NOT A PUBLIC PRIVATE COLLABORATION- CALLED SOURCE DIVERSE SOURCES LOCAL. AND WE'RE WORKING TO STRENGTHEN INCLUSIVE PROCUREMENT PROGRAMS AND BUILD I'M MORE RESILIENT CALIFORNIA BASED SUPPLY CHAIN SILVA SPEAKING TO THE PROCUREMENT THAT MR DANIEL BROUGHT UP WE ARE ACTIVELY. WORKING ON A PROGRAM WE CHEST- HAD THAT THE RFP- SELECTION PROCESS AND IF SELECTED- I'M A PARTNER AND WE WILL HAVE THE BASIC SAYS I'M SELLING TO CORPORATE TO- INTO DEEDS AND THEN A CONTRACT RIGHT WERE ALREADY KNOW SIX ELEVATOR. AND THAT WILL BE COMING VERY SOON THIS CELL NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT PROCUREMENT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND WE ARE SUPPORTING NOT. ALSO WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT EARLIER ARE GET DIGITAL CALIFORNIA EFFORT- BUT WE ARE CONTINUING TO STAND THAT UP ON THE AND- PROVIDING TECHNOLOGY LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOOT CAMPS AND ALL OF THAT. AGAIN AIMED AT PART OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. ON THE INTERNET I WOULD SAY THE ONE THING- IS TO REALLY FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN AND OF COURSE I'VE GOT SIXTY DAYS IN THE SEAT. ARM TO KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING- I THINK THAT THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT TO- THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATORS LIKE YOURSELF AND PUT TOGETHER IS. HAS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY AND ACT AND I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WITH THIS UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF RESOURCES BUDGETED SPECIFICALLY. ACT SMALL BUSINESSES. THANK YOU ALL AND THANK YOU AND THAT GUESTS WEIRD THRILLED TO HAVE YOU THE SIDE ROLE AND THE CRITIC TO WORK WITH YOU. MR OF ANY S. ANYTHING THAT LAST YOU AND MAKE SURE WE TOUCH ON AND WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO TOMORROW IT'S DIFFICULT IT'S DIFFICULT TO NARROW THIS DOWN- AS EXAMPLE WHEN- WE- SERVICE MEMBERS EVERY YEAR BEFORE. WE PUT OUR PROGRAM OR TO THE FOR THE NEXT YEAR. AND FOR THE FIRST MANY YEARS WAS ALWAYS REGULATORY REGULATORY REGULATORY WILL NOW WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT COME UP. TO TWO PRETTY MUCH EQUAL AS IT IS. TO TWO BIGGEST THINGS. I WOULD SAY AND THIS IS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE VERY BIG BUT I WOULD SAY. THE ONE THING CALIFORNIA COULD DO TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM LEAVING THE STATE. PROBABLY WOULD BE. DO SO ABOUT THE REGULATORY MORASS THAT- IT JUST CRUSHES THE BUSINESSES- THERE JUST NO WAY TO KEEP UP. AND THAT LEADS TO THINGS LIKE PAGA LAWSUITS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T DONE CROSSED EVERY I DOTTED EVERY T. SO. THE OTHER WAY AROUND ANYWAY- AND IT JUST IT JUST CRUSHING THE SMALLER THE BILL IS THE MOST DIFFICULT IT IS. AFTER SAID SO I YOUR NUMBER ONE YOUR YOUR YOUR TOP PRIORITY IN THE TOP PRIORITY FOR THE BUSINESSES THAT TODD THAT YOU REPRESENT WOULD BE RATIONALIZING THAT. AT YES I LIKE THAT YOU BROUGHT A VISUAL AID RIGHT NOT RATIONALIZING THE- DEVELOPMENT BANK OF HR LAW YEAH THIS DOESN'T GAP GOING TO ANY OTHER KINDS OF REGULAR REGULATORY. ISSUES YOU KNOW THE CARB THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING WITH. TRUCKS AND DIESEL STUFF HOLD EITHER- HUGE LINER PROBLEMS ABROAD DOWN AND AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO BE THE WORLD LEADER IN THAT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. WHEN KERR PUTS ON A NEW STANDARD A LOT OF DIESEL TRUCKS GO TO NEVADA OR OREGON OR WASHINGTON SO WHAT WE REALLY DONE. BUT ANYWAY IT YEAH THE WHOLE REGULATORY THING IS JUST CRUSHING AND HAVE KEPT THANK YOU AND NOT ALSO IS IN FACT. SHOULD ALL SHARE WITH EVERYONE- WILL WILL MAKE SURE EMAIL YOU ARE AT THE R. DRAFT HEARING PLAN FOR THE REST OF YOUR POSSESS THE REGULATORY CHALLENGES. IS ALSO A HEARING TOPIC AND- SO LOOK FOR TO DIGGING INTO THAT PARTHIA. AND MR DANIEL CHORE SO LET ME LET ME HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE PROGRAM'S REAL QUICK THAT THAT WE'RE DOING THAT REALLY KIND OF OFF THAT EXACTLY WHAT WE STARTED WITH WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND GOBIZ ON THE AND DIGITAL PROGRAMMING. I'M WORKING WITH THE CITIES OF GARDEN GROVE IN CITY OF UP WHEN A PARK AND WE'RE BUILDING A PROGRAM WHERE. WE TAKE AN EXISTING BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES AND TEACHING THEM HOW TO USE PAID ADVERTISING AND THEN ONCE THEY COMPLETE THE PROGRAM THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO GET A GRANT FROM THE CITY- THAT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ACTUALLY USE PAID ADVERTISING TO DRIVE TRAFFIC INTO THEIR BUSINESS. AND WHEN YOU EXTRAPOLATE THAT ACROSS THE MAIN STREET OR DOWNTOWN THE EFFECT THAT THAT CAN HAVE IS HUGE AND CAN YOU TEACH BUSINESSES HOW TO USE. PAID ADVERTISING SO I THINK THAT IS DEFINITELY A WAVE OF THE FUTURE AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE CITIES AND COUNTIES REALLY STEP UP. AND START OFFERING LOAN PROGRAMS WHICH IS VERY UNIQUE- WE ACTUALLY HELPED A COUPLE CITIES RUN THEM IT WHERE WE ARE IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT WHEN EMPIRE. AND SO I THINK. HAVING CITIES THE ABILITY TO LEND MONEY AND BECOME A LENDER IS A REALLY INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE AND- YOU KNOW IT A LOT OF THAT IS AROUND C. B. G. BUT NOW WE'RE STARTING TO SEE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD FOR THEIR MAIN STREETS TO BE TAKEN TO THE CAN'T AFFORD FOR THEIR DENTAL. AND DOCTORS OFFICES STATE TO BE VACANT- YOU KNOW AND THEN. WITH THE ONE PIECE ABOUT YOU KNOW EMPLOYEE EMPLOYMENT AND REALLY RESTAURANT RETAIL AND HOSPITALITY. IS YOU KNOW TO SEE A SUBSIDY FOR EMPLOYERS. L. EVEN IF IT'S FOR THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME YOU KNOW TO KIND OF OFFSET THAT THAT WAGE GAP OF YOU KNOW IF I COULD GIVE YOU AN EXTRA FIVE DOLLARS. YOU MIGHT COME BACK TO WORK RIGHT I CAN PAY YOU TWENTY. TWENTY HOURS AND HOURS AT A FIFTEEN MINUTE THE SERPENTINE AND MAYBE THAT COULD BE A SUBSIDY OF SOME KIND. WHERE NOW YOU'RE DRIVING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK- NOT SURE HOW LONG THAT'S GOING TO BE NEEDED BUT IT MAY BE A LONG TIME I DON'T THINK ANY OF US KNOW- AND THEN YOU KNOW FOR OUR PROGRAM YOU KNOW I THINK CONTINUED SUPPORT WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMMING. AND FUNDING IS ALWAYS AN OPPORTUNITY THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE AN EXPANSION OF ALL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDED. TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE ABLE TO RECOVER. AND REALLY GROW IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. THANK YOU I THANK YOU. THOSE AND- YOU ALL- YOUR INPUT AND INSIGHT AND FOR SPENDING YOUR TIME WITH US THIS MORNING. REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND LOOK FOR IT IS A SAID TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU. AS THAT AS THE SESSION UNFOLDS. THANK YOU AND THAT WITH THAT. I THINK WE'LL GO AHEAD AND TRANSITION TO PUBLIC COMMENT. LET'S SEE. ALL RIGHT I'M SO FIVE JUST TO TEAR UP OUR PUBLIC COMMENTS PORTION I AM I REQUEST IS THAT SPEAKERS LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES PER PERSON SO THAT WE ENSURE TIME FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS. I IN THE IN PERCENT SO IF ANYONE IS HERE WITH US TODAY AND WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN PERSON PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND AND I'LL ASK YOU TO APPROACH THE MICROPHONE AND JUST A REMINDER AS WE SAID EARLIER PLEASE DON'T TOUCH THE MICROPHONE. UP PLEASE. A GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID DAWSON- WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE- PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY VERY INFORMATIVE HEARING I THINK IT'S- THE FIRST HEARING I'VE SEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME IF EVER FROM THIS- SELECT COMMITTEE SO- IT'S REALLY ENCOURAGING THAT YOU'VE TAKEN THE LEADERSHIP- TO DIRECT THE COMMITTEE TO STAND UP IN A AND ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT ARE AFFECTING SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP- YOUR LAST OF YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE THE LEGISLATURE TO DO TOMORROW AND IF- IF I MAY SUGGEST A NO WOULDN'T HAPPEN BUT MY WISH LIST WOULD BE THAT THE GOVERNOR CALLED SPECIAL SESSION TO ADDRESS- THE- ON SLOT OF CONCERNS. SOME OF WHICH WERE MENTIONED HERE BUT SOME WHICH WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE COMING FOR SMALL BUSINESS SMALL BUSINESSES REPRESENT 98% OF OUR ECONOMY OUR ECONOMY AND THAT IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND- AS MISTER OF ANY US SO- EFFECTIVELY DEMONSTRATED THERE IS A VERY LARGE TELEPHONE BOOK THAT STANDS IN THEIR WAY OF SUCCESS I WOULD PROPOSE TO YOU- MADAM CHAIR THAT YOU IN THE MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMITTEE RUN A START UP PERPETUALLY. AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL EVERY TWO YEARS YOU'RE STARTING UP YOUR BUSINESS YEAR EVALUATING YOUR MARKETING STRATEGY YOU'RE EVALUATING YOUR FUNDING STRATEGY IN YOUR VALUE ANY OPPOSITION. THAT IS WHAT A BUSINESS OWNER IS DOING HAS DONE AND IS DOING RIGHT NOW POST CAN'T POST PANDEMIC. THE MORE BEARS THERE I YOUR WAY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO GET ELECTED THE MORE BETTER BILL THE BEARS ARE IN THE AY OF A SMALL BUSINESS. AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR THEIR FAMILIES THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO I BILL I WOULD I WOULDASK THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR- POLISHED BEZEL SESSION TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. AND I DO SUPPORT- AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE THE FUNDING TO THIS TAPE NETWORK. AS FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT WERE ARTICULATED THE NEEDS THE RESULTS ARE IN. THE RESULTS ARE STRONG BUT THE NEEDS ARE EVEN GREATER THAN THE PROVIDERS- HAVE THE COULD CAPABILITY TO DELIVER AT THIS TIME. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU FOR AD FOR JOINING US MISTER NELSON. I CAN'T TOUCH THE MIKE BUT CAN YOU HEAR ME YES OKAY I DIDN'T BRING MY TELEPHONE BOOKS IS. HE DID JUMP UP A FEW FEET SO THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAIRWOMAN OF FOR THIS VERY INFORMATIVE HEARING AS MY COLLEAGUE HAD JUST INDICATED- WE'VE I THINK WE'VE LEARNED A LOT TODAY I ALSO WANTED TO TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO- THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING- DIRECTOR GRAY SHE IS AN AMAZING WOMAN WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HER- I'M HERE. LAURIE CAMERI FORGOT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF ON BEHALF OF NAPO NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS CALIFORNIA AND ALSO SMALL BUSINESS CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S- SO WHO I AM BUT- I THINK YOU KNOW DIDN'T KIND OF PLAYING OFF THE SAME. QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED WHAT IF THE LEGISLATURE COULD DO SOMETHING. TOMORROW WHAT WOULD IT BE- THE- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF- BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GO BIZ HAS COME UP WITH A VERY VERY- I THINK IT'S EXCELLENT PROGRAM THE CALIFORNIA DREAM FUND THAT WOULD PROVIDE GRANT PROGRAMS TO- THOSE START UP COMPANIES- AND WE APPLIED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION FOR COMING FORTH WITH THAT- THE- THE- BRUNT OF THE WORK IS GOING TO BE THROUGH THE- SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS IN THE WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTERS. AND SO WE'LL BE WORKING WITH THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROGRAM IS ADEQUATELY FUNDED BECAUSE OF ALL THE GREAT WORK THAT THEY WILL DO AND A LOT OF. THE EXPECTED VOLUME OF START UP COMPANIES THAT WILL BE COMING- AND YOU'VE BEEN TAKING ADVANTAGE AND USUAL UTILIZING THE CALIFORNIA DREAM FUND SO WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL BE IN TOUCH WELL AND THANK YOU YES THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THAT AND THANK YOU. FOR YOUR WORK IN PARTNERSHIP ON THAT SET. SUCH A CRITICAL INITIATIVE THANKS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I AM MATT SUTTON OF CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION AGREE. THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING THE HEARING WE THINK THIS IS A GREAT DISCUSSION. IT'S ALSO REALLY EASY. TO FORGET. EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN MARCH AND SINCE SO I APPRECIATE IT WE'RE VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT RE OPENING- AND CERTAINLY GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO DO SO SINCE JUNE FIFTEENTH- A COUPLE THINGS I WOULD POINT OUT. 85% OF OUR MEMBERSHIP ARE THOSE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY RESTAURANTS THAT ARE SPREAD THROUGHOUT YOUR DISTRICT AND OTHERS. SO THERE IS A LOT OF OPTIMISM BUT THE CLOSURES IMPACTED EVERYBODY UNIQUELY AND- REGARDLESS OF WHAT SIZE OR SHAPE OF RESTAURANT YOU WERE. YOU ARE FACED WITH THE SAME HEALTH ORDERS FROM THE STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT REQUIRED YOU TO CLOSE. BAND OUTDOOR DINING IN CERTAIN CASES ABANDONED OR DINING IN CERTAIN CASES AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT. NOT EVERY RESTAURANT IS EQUIPPED ARE INTERESTED OR ABLE TO DO TAKE OUT. SO MANY DID TAKE OUT AT AN EXTREME FINANCIAL LOSS AND THAT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO KEEP A FEW EMPLOYEES ON- AND TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES SO. WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT OUT OF THE WOODS I'D SAY THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW IS EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO RE HIRE ALL AT ONCE. AND SO THE HIRING CHALLENGES ARE ACROSS THE BOARD WE NOTES FOR MANY INDUSTRIES IT'S CERTAINLY TRUE FOR THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY. AND SO THAT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME TO WORK THROUGH. I THINK HE EVEN- JUST TO STOP FOR A MINUTE WE WERE TRYING AS A STATE TO LIMIT THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE. TO COME BACK AGAINST COVE IT. OUR WHOLE BUSINESS MODEL IS GATHERING PEOPLE- WERE ALSO ONE OF THE MOST LABOR INTENSIVE. INDUSTRIES IN THE STATE- WE EMPLOYEES SOME OF THE MOST MOST NUMBERS OF PEOPLE. AND JUST IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND RESTAURANT WORKERS WERE. LAID OFF OR FURLOUGHED SO THE HOPE IS TO BRING MANY OF THEM BACK- THAT'S THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS. AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE ON GOING CHALLENGES ARE CERTAINLY A FEW THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES. I THINK ARE TRUE FOR JUST ABOUT EVERY INDUSTRY CERTAINLY TRUE FOR RESTAURANTS- EVERYTHING FROM FOOD COSTS- TO EVERYTHING ELSE ACROSS THE BOARD OUR OUR WAY UP AND THEN THERE'S JUST AVAILABILITY LOTS OF THINGS AREN'T AVAILABLE. AND SO WE'RE CERTAINLY ASKING FOR LOTS OF PATIENTS- IN RESTAURANTS SPECIFICALLY JUST DUE TO THAT- 60% OF CALIFORNIA'S RESTAURANTS ARE OWNED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR. OF THE RESTAURANTS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE MOST OF THOSE OPERATORS AND OWNERS LIVE RIGHT THERE IN THEIR COMMUNITY SO THEY ARE THE FABRIC OF THAT COMMUNITY. THERE'S BEEN SOME RELIEF AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE MOST RECENT RESTAURANT REVITALIZATION FUND. ACTUALLY RAN OUT OF MONEY BEFORE HALF OF THE APPLICANTS IN CALIFORNIA WERE ABLE TO GET- ANY ASSISTANCE SO. THERE IS STILL TREMENDOUS NEED AND I THINK JUST TO WRAP IT UP AND SAY. YOU KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE MASSIVE INDEBTEDNESS FROM RESTAURATEURS MOVING FORWARD THAT'S A CHALLENGE. THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES HAVE HIT ON A BIT. THE HIRING ISSUES ARE COMPLEX BUT THEY'RE REAL- THERE'S A NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS I THINK TO THAT- AND THEN YOU MENTIONED THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE- SOLVENCY ISSUE WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE AND- YOU KNOW. THIS IS GONNA BE A MULTI YEAR OF RECOVERY FOR RESTAURANTS SO IT'S GONNA BE A LONG LONG LONG RUN WAY. AND WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME ASSISTANCE ALONG THE WAY. BUT WE'RE ALSO GONNA NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO CLUTTER ON THE RUNWAY CLUTTER WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SOLVENCY ISSUE. WE'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE WE SAW IN 200-089-1011 AND BEYOND. AND WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO IS WE REPAY THAT DEBT IS EMPLOYERS. AND IT'S PER EMPLOYEE SO IT'S A TAX PER EMPLOYEE TO PAY THAT BACK IN SO WITH RESTAURANTS THAT ASK YOU TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LARGE SMALL. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS RESTAURANTS ARE LABOR INTENSIVE. SMALL RESTAURANTS USE A LOT OF PEOPLE. SO WHAT YOU OFTEN CONSIDER SMALL MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE SMALL IN THE RESTAURANT CONTACT SO. I LEAVE YOU WITH THAT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND I SURE HOPE WE CAN- PARTICIPATE PRODUCTIVELY IN FUTURE HEARINGS THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THAT THE AT THE ISSUES FACING THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY- AND FOR BEING HERE. YOU BET THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING STILL RIGHT GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR- DAVE BUTLER I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF UNITED CHAMBER ADVOCACY NETWORK OTHERWISE KNOWN AS YOU CAN. WE'RE A NETWORK OF SEVEN LOCAL CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE HERE IN THE GREATER SACRAMENTO REGION. AND THAT WE WORK TOGETHER TO ADVOCATE ON ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANCE TO THOSE CHAMBERS MEMBERS AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND EVERY YEAR. WE SURVEY OUR MEMBERS TO FIND OUT. WHAT THEIR- CHALLENGES ARE IN WHAT. A CHALLENGES THEY'RE HAVING AT THE STATE LEVEL IN AS MR OF ANY US MENTIONED. CONSISTENTLY IT'S REGULATIONS HR POLICY. BUT THIS YEAR. OUR MEMBERS AND LEADERSHIP SAID WITHOUT A DOUBT THEIR TOP PRIORITY WAS RE OPENING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND RE OPENING SMALL BUSINESS. AND SO- WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THAT THIS YEAR AROUND MARCH WE WERE STARTING TO HEAR FROM OUR MEMBERS. THAT THEIR BUSINESSES WERE OPENING UP BUT THEY WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY FINDING WORK FORCE. AND WE HAD HEARD FROM ONE OF OUR CHAMBER EXACTS THAT SHE'S HEARING FROM HER MEMBERS THAT IT'S BECAUSE OF THE ENHANCED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OF PEOPLE RECEIVING. WE DIDN'T WANT TO JUST ACT ON THAT HERE SAY WE ACTUALLY DID A SURVEY TO. THE MEMBERS OF THOSE SEVEN JAMES I'M HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS WE FOUND THAT 80% OF THOSE CHAMBER MEMBERS WHO RESPONDED HAVE JOB OPENINGS. OF THOSE 80% 80% WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY FILLING THOSE POSITIONS AND OF THOSE WHO ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY FILLING THE DIFFICULTY FILLING THOSE POSITIONS. 56% SAID THAT THEY WERE HEARING FROM JOB SEEKERS. THAT THEY WOULD RATHER ACCEPT THE PUBLIC BENEFITS THE ENHANCE PUBLIC BENEFITS AN ACCEPTED JOB. THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN AND WE ALSO TESTED CHILD CARE WE ALSO TESTED FAMILY HEALTH WE ALSO TESTED- CONCERN ABOUT COMING BACK TO WORK NOTHING ROSE TO THE TOP LIKE. THE CONCERN ABOUT ENHANCE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS SO RATHER GNASH OUR TEETH WE PUT TOGETHER A COALITION OF STATE AND REGIONAL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS COUNCIL AND WE COMMUNICATED TO OUR LEGISLATORS AND TO- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS ECONOMIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND- EDT. RECOMMENDING A FEW THINGS ONE WAS REESTABLISHING THE JOB SEARCH REQUIREMENT WHICH HAPPENED AND THAT WAS GREAT BUT A WEEK LATER. SECONDLY WE ENCOURAGED ET DE TO DO THEIR OWN ASSESSMENT OF JOB SEEKERS TO FIND OUT WHY THEY'RE CHOOSING NOT TO ACCEPT JOBS AS OPPOSED TO- CHOOSING PERHAPS PUBLIC BENEFIT OR MAYBE. THESE OTHER REASONS I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY. RESEARCH DONE ABOUT THOSE OTHER REASONS YOU HEARD AGAIN TODAY I THINK I THINK IT MAY IT MAY. NO ONE'S BEEN DOING THE RESEARCH EDT IS WELL POSITIONED. TO DO THAT RESEARCH. AND THEN BASED ON THAT I'D I'D LIKE TO SEE A QUICK THREE TO FOUR WEEK ANALYSIS BASED ON THAT INFORMATION AND IF IT'S TRUE WHAT REAFFIRMING WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM EMPLOYERS. THEN PERHAPS REDIRECT A PORTION OF THOSE ENHANCE BENEFITS FROM THE FEDS TOWARDS- HIRING BONUSES OR RETENTION BONUSES THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THE STATE CAN DO IN THE STATE CAN DO. QUICKLY AT LEAST ASSESS THAT AND THEN CONSIDER IF IN FACT THAT'S HAPPENING. REDIRECT THOSE FUNDS SO THAT'S WHAT WE'D RECOMMEND ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU- IN THE COMMITTEE ON THOSE THINGS LAST THING IS I JUST SAY WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT GRANTS. A LOT ABOUT- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU REMEMBER WHAT SMALL BUSINESSES NEED MORE THAN ANYTHING IS A MARKET. IF THEY DON'T HAVE A MARKET DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH. CAPITAL THEY GET DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH CONSULTING THE GAP. AND JUST THINK ABOUT THE STATE'S ROLE IN CREATING A MARKET PLACE. LOOK AT CHICORY RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET CLOSED PERMANENTLY. BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THIS BIT BUILDING ARE NOT HERE. SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN OUR MARKETPLACE IS THE LARGEST HEAD QUARTER COMPANY. THE LARGEST EMPLOYER. AND SO IF THE STATE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING IT CAN BRING PEOPLE BACK TO FILL THESE BUILDINGS. TO FILL THOSE RESTAURANTS AND FILL THOSE RETAIL SPACES AND ENCOURAGE OTHER PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS- TO DO THE SAME SUB JUST. JUST A THOUGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT AND YES IT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING AS THE SURVEY- THAT YOU MENTIONED GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SEEN AT NO ONE ELSE IN THE HEARING ROOM WISHING AT TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT. WE ARE ALSO USING A MODERATED TELEPHONE SERVICE. AS A REMINDER THE CALL IN NUMBER FOR THIS HEARING IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN.

STREET BUT ALSO INCLUDING BIGGER VENUES LIKE THE BILL GRAHAM AUDITORIUM IN SAN FRANCISCO- MAJORITY OF OUR MENUS ARE BARBECUES AND VOTERS ARE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT SERRA ANCHOR TENANTS FOR COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR SO THAT EVERY DOLLAR SPENT AT A LOCAL SHOW- RESULTING IN TWELVE DOLLARS IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY AT RESTAURANTS BARS WATCHING PARKING REVENUE CETERA. AND EVEN USE HAVE BEEN DEPENDING ON THE FEDERAL SHUTTERED VENUE OPERATOR GRANT PASSED BY CONGRESS IN DECEMBER TO STAY ALIVE- IN CONTRAST TO THE RESTAURANT OPERATOR FUNDS WEAPONS BY- MISTER SUTTON- APPROVED BY THE FACT THAT YOU'RE OUT THE DOOR- AND MEDIALLY MANY VENUES- HAVE EXPERIENCE AT TREMENDOUS DELAY IN GETTING RELIEF.
