OFF AND ON SINCE LAST SEPTEMBER

00:24:12.651 --> 00:24:14.286
OVER THIS PROJECT IF IT'S COMING

00:24:14.352 --> 00:24:14.886
TOGETHER NOW THAT I THINK WE

00:24:14.953 --> 00:24:16.354
HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN FRONT

00:24:16.421 --> 00:24:17.789
OF US ABOUT THE POSSIBLE.

00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:19.991

M. WE DIDN'T AUDIT LAST YEAR.

00:24:22.227 --> 00:24:24.196
AND FOUND SOME YOU KNOW

00:24:24.262 --> 00:24:24.830
SOMETHING'S OR PRIEST ARE LIKE

00:24:24.896 --> 00:24:26.097
THE FINANCIAL ANNOUNCES HAD NOT

00:24:26.164 --> 00:24:27.833
BEEN DONE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT

00:24:27.899 --> 00:24:29.267
ANALYSIS HAD NOT BEEN DONE TO

00:24:29.334 --> 00:24:29.868
THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT

00:24:29.935 --> 00:24:31.002
HAVEN'T BEEN DONE.

00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:32.470
WE'RE STILL NOT SURE OF EXACT

00:24:32.537 --> 00:24:34.172
COSTS.

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:35.774
WE'RE NOT SURE OF EXACT FUNDING.

00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:37.509
NOW WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE

00:24:37.576 --> 00:24:38.977
IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT

00:24:39.044 --> 00:24:41.346
WILDLIFE FISH.

00:24:41.413 --> 00:24:43.515
AND AS WE ALL KNOW SEX AND

00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:44.082
EXPERTS HAVE VERY DIFFERENT

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.449
VIEWS ON THIS.

00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:45.517
.

00:24:45.584 --> 00:24:47.452
IF WE LOOK AT MEGA PROJECTS

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:48.987
AROUND THE WORLD WE KNOW THAT.

00:24:49.054 --> 00:24:51.356
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT.

00:24:51.423 --> 00:24:53.158

ESTIMATED SO THEN SO THEN THE

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.334
QUESTION BECOMES WILL AND WHO

WILL PAY FOR ALL OF THAT. WHO

00:25:03.902 --> 00:25:05.604

IS BEEN ESTABLISHED MULTIPLE

00:25:08.373 --> 00:25:09.574
TIMES?

00:25:09.641 --> 00:25:10.742
THAT THIS PROJECT WILL NOT

00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:12.344
CREATE ONE EXTRA DROP OF WATER

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.145
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:25:14.212 --> 00:25:15.614

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:38.910
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

00:29:38.977 --> 00:29:40.979
DISAGREEMENT THAT THIS EXISTING

00:29:41.045 --> 00:29:42.313
INFRASTRUCTURE FACES DIFFICULT

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.348
CHALLENGES UNLESS CHANGES ARE

00:29:43.414 --> 00:29:45.617
MADE.

00:29:45.683 --> 00:29:47.252
WATER FIX IS ESSENTIALLY AN

00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:48.887
UPGRADE TO THIS NINETEEN SIXTIES

00:29:48.953 --> 00:29:50.788
ERA INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IT WILL

00:29:50.855 --> 00:29:53.124
IMPROVE THE RELIABILITY OF WATER

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:54.058
SUPPLIES FOR TWENTY SEVEN

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:56.027
MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND THREE

00:29:56.094 --> 00:29:57.495
MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND. AND

00:29:57.562 --> 00:29:59.364
ALSO RESTORE MORE NATURAL FLOW

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.167
PATTERN A IN THE SOUTH DELTA.

00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:03.968
WATER FIXES IN IT IS IN ADDITION

00:30:04.035 --> 00:30:05.703
TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.505
WILL BE OWNED AND OPERATED BY

00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:08.773
THE DEPARTMENT OF THE WATER.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.642
WATER RESOURCES IN THE SAME

00:30:10.708 --> 00:30:11.776
MANNER THAT THE STATE WATER

00:30:11.843 --> 00:30:13.344
PROJECT HAS BEEN ARE OPERATED

00:30:13.411 --> 00:30:14.712
AND MANAGED

00:30:14.779 --> 00:30:15.947
A BY THE DEPARTMENT OVER THE

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:18.049
LAST SEVERAL DECADES.

00:30:18.116 --> 00:30:19.684
WATER FIX WOULD ADD THREE NEW

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:20.852
INTAKES FOR THE STATE WATER

00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:22.887
PROJECT WITH STATE OF THE ART

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:24.989
FISH SCREENS TO THE NORTH DELTA

00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:27.659
AWAY FROM SENSITIVE FISH HABITAT.

00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:29.460
THIS WILL PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO

00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:31.262
OPERATE THE STATE WATER PROJECT

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:32.730
USING EITHER THE NORTH OR SOUTH

00:30:32.797 --> 00:30:33.965
FACILITIES TO LESSEN IMPACTS ON

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:35.934
FISH.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.101
WILL PROVIDE OUR FEDERAL

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:38.236
PARTNERS THE U. S. BUREAU OF

00:30:38.303 --> 00:30:40.205
RECLAMATION THE ABILITY TO

00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:41.472
OPERATE THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:42.473
PROJECT WITH THAT SAME

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.642
FLEXIBILITY.

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:46.311
THE PROJECT WOULD MOVE A MAXIMUM

00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:47.912
OF NINE THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER

00:30:47.979 --> 00:30:49.781
SECOND. THROUGH TWO TUNNELS AND

00:30:49.847 --> 00:30:51.182
IT WILL BE OPERATED TO COMPLY

00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:52.550
WITH EXISTING STATE WATER

00:30:52.617 --> 00:30:54.752
PROJECT CONTRACTS. AS WELL AS

00:30:54.819 --> 00:30:56.554
PERMITTED FLOW CRITERIA TO MEET

00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:57.422
BOTH FISHERY IN WATER QUALITY

00:30:57.488 --> 00:30:59.324
NEEDS.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.893
ONE OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.494
HAVE PROVIDED DESCRIBES SOME

00:31:03.561 --> 00:31:04.395
RECENT DESIGN BY MINTS THAT

00:31:04.462 --> 00:31:05.630
WE'VE DEVELOPED OVER MANY YEARS

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:06.598
OF STUDY.

00:31:06.664 --> 00:31:08.566
RESULTING IN A SMALLER PROJECT

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:10.001
FOR PRINT AND FEWER IMPACTS TO

00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:11.669
LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

00:31:11.736 --> 00:31:14.072
ON THIS TYPE OF OPTIMIZATION HAS

00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:15.440
BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:16.874
PART OF OUR EFFORTS AS WE WORK

00:31:16.941 --> 00:31:18.676
TO REACH FINAL DESIGN.

00:31:18.743 --> 00:31:20.845
I DO WANNA ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT

00:31:20.912 --> 00:31:22.146
THAT THIS PROJECT DOES HAVE

00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:24.115
TREMENDOUS PHYSICAL IMPACT ON

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:25.483
DELTA COMMUNITIES THERE'S JUST

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:28.152
ABSOLUTELY. NO WAY AROUND THAT

00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:29.287
AND.

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:30.922
IT IS OUR DESIRE AND I'LL

00:31:30.989 --> 00:31:33.224
DESCRIBE. IN A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:35.493
DETAIL AT IN A MOMENT A IS OUR

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.861
DESIRE THAT THE DEPARTMENT WORKS

00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:38.896
INTENSIVELY WITH OTHER

00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:40.898
CONSTRUCTION A JOINT POWERS

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:43.268
AUTHORITY. TO AYE ABLY.

00:31:43.334 --> 00:31:45.169
MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTS AS

00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:47.071
REQUIRED BY LAW.

00:31:47.138 --> 00:31:48.239
THE DEVELOPMENT OF WATER FIX HAS

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:49.874
BEEN VERY COMPLEX

00:31:49.941 --> 00:31:51.209
IT'S TAKEN YEARS OF PLANNING

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:53.111
STUDY AND COLLABORATION TO GET

00:31:53.177 --> 00:31:55.013
TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE TODAY.

00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:56.247
OTHER WATER FIX IS A PROJECT

00:31:56.314 --> 00:31:57.582
THAT WILL ADDRESS ECOSYSTEM

00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:59.450
CONCERNS WHILE SECURING THIS

00:31:59.517 --> 00:32:00.718
CRITICAL WATER SUPPLY FOR

00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:02.587
CALIFORNIA IN FULFILLMENT OF THE

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:04.188
DIRECTOR OF THE DIRECTIVE OF THE

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:05.757
DELTA REFORM ACT IN TWO THOUSAND

00:32:05.823 --> 00:32:07.592
NINE. WHICH WAS TO IMPROVE WATER

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:09.127
SUPPLY RELIABILITY AND IMPROVE

00:32:09.193 --> 00:32:11.296
THE HEALTH OF THE DELTA.

00:32:11.362 --> 00:32:12.764
ULTIMATELY THE REASON FOR WATER

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:13.965
FIX ITSELF IS NOT PARTICULARLY

00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:15.400
COMPLEX

00:32:15.466 --> 00:32:16.534
OUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE

00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:18.269
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE TELLS

00:32:18.336 --> 00:32:19.604
US THAT WE CAN EXPECT FLASHER

00:32:19.671 --> 00:32:21.506
STORM EVENTS. AND LONGER PERIODS

00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:23.241
OF DROUGHT IN THE FUTURE.

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:24.909
SUCH CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION

00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:26.511
WILL IMPACT BOTH OF THOSE DELTA

00:32:26.577 --> 00:32:28.413
REFORM ACT GOALS.

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:29.747
WHAT WATER FIX WILL DO IS

00:32:29.814 --> 00:32:31.516
INCREASE CLIMATE RESILIENCY BY

00:32:31.582 --> 00:32:32.984
ALLOWING THE EFFICIENT MOVEMENT

00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:34.385
OF WATER THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND

00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:36.254
INTO STORAGE WHEN THAT WATER IS

00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:38.022
AVAILABLE AND GREATLY REDUCE

00:32:38.089 --> 00:32:40.091
IMPACTS ON SPECIES?

00:32:40.158 --> 00:32:41.926
IT WILL DO THIS A IN THE PART OF

00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:43.061
THE DELTA THAT IS MUCH LESS

00:32:43.127 --> 00:32:44.395
SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE EFFECTS OF

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:46.030
SEA LEVEL RISE. AND GREATER

00:32:46.097 --> 00:32:47.665
WATER QUALITY FLUCTUATIONS THAT

00:32:47.732 --> 00:32:49.000
WE CAN EXPECT WITH THE EFFECTS

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:50.668
OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:52.370
BY EFFICIENTLY AND SAFELY MOVING

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:53.571
WATER THROUGH THE DELTA WHEN

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:55.373
IT'S AVAILABLE. WE BELIEVE WATER

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.041
FIX STRENGTHENS THE STATE'S

00:32:57.108 --> 00:32:58.676
EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF WATER

00:32:58.743 --> 00:33:00.511
SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES

00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:01.946
WATER FIX IS JUST ONE OF MANY

00:33:02.013 --> 00:33:03.581
PRIORITIES INCLUDED IN THE

00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:05.016
GOVERNOR'S WATER ACTION PLAN.

00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:06.250
AND THIS PLAN INTEGRATES THE

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:08.019
MANY WATER SUPPLY TOOLS AT OUR

00:33:08.086 --> 00:33:09.554
DISPOSAL INCLUDING RENEWED

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.023
EMPHASIS ON WATER CONSERVATION.

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.524
WATER FIX IS THE BEST WAY TO

00:33:13.591 --> 00:33:14.826
HELP REGIONAL WATER MANAGERS

00:33:14.892 --> 00:33:16.694
PURSUE THOSE PORTFOLIO OPTIONS

00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:18.029
AND MAXIMIZE LOCAL INNOVATION

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:19.697
AND RESILIENCY.

00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:21.299
REGARDING LOCAL GROUND WATER

00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:22.767
BASINS AS WELL AS NEW STORAGE

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:24.402
WILL REQUIRE RELIABLE SURFACE

00:33:24.469 --> 00:33:25.903
WATER SUPPLY.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.538
RECYCLING PROGRAMS BENEFIT FROM

00:33:27.605 --> 00:33:29.140
THE CLEANER ORIGINAL SUPPLY THAT

00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:30.441
DELTA WATER WOULD CONTINUE TO

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:32.510
PROVIDE WITH WATER FIX.

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:33.578
INSTABILITY OF THE STATE'S

00:33:33.644 --> 00:33:35.580
LARGEST SOURCE OF RELIABLE WATER

00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:37.148
WOULD MAKE INVESTMENT IN EACH OF

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:39.784
THESE OTHER WATER SUPPLY AREAS.

00:33:39.851 --> 00:33:42.153
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.588
AND WHILE WATER CONSERVATION

00:33:43.654 --> 00:33:45.556
RECYCLING DESALINATION AND

00:33:45.623 --> 00:33:46.290
GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ARE

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:47.458
VITAL COMPONENTS OF THE

00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:49.360
PORTFOLIO. FOR LOCAL AND

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:50.862
REGIONAL WATER MANAGERS THEY

00:33:50.928 --> 00:33:52.263
SIMPLY DON'T PROVIDE ENOUGH

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.031
WATER TO REPLACE SUPPLIES

00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:55.433
CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY THE STATE

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.468
AND FEDERAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN

00:33:57.535 --> 00:33:59.570
DESPERATE NEED OF AN UPGRADE.

00:33:59.637 --> 00:34:00.705
MANY REGIONS IN THE STATE

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:02.740
HEAVILY RELY ON DELTA CONVEYED

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:04.375
WATER PRINCIPALLY PARTS OF THE

00:34:04.442 --> 00:34:05.943
BAY AREA CENTRAL VALLEY IN

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.612
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:08.546
THERE WATER PLANNERS PREDICT

00:34:08.613 --> 00:34:10.181
DECLINING RELIABILITY OF THESE

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:12.083
SUPPLIES EVEN WITH INVESTMENTS

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.518
IN CONSERVATION RECYCLING

00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:14.585
GROUNDWATER DESALINATION

00:34:14.652 --> 00:34:16.087
STRATEGIES.

00:34:16.154 --> 00:34:17.355
THEY ARE ALSO PARTICULARLY

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:18.756
INTERESTED IN PURSUING AND

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:20.258
PROTECTING THE MOST AFFORDABLE

00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:22.527
SUPPLIES FOR THEIR RATE PAYERS.

00:34:22.593 --> 00:34:24.195
AFTER ELEVEN YEARS OF ANALYSIS

00:34:24.262 --> 00:34:26.197
DIALOGUE IN SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY

00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:27.932
WATER FIX REMAINS THE BEST

00:34:27.999 --> 00:34:29.233
APPROACH TO COMPLY WITH STATE

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.535
AND FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

00:34:30.601 --> 00:34:32.670
THAT PROTECT SPECIES HABITAT IN

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:34.605
WATER QUALITY. WHILE SECURING A

00:34:34.672 --> 00:34:36.007
CONTINUED RELIABLE AND

00:34:36.073 --> 00:34:38.209
AFFORDABLE WATER SUPPLY.

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:39.944
THE COST OF THE PROJECT IS.

00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:41.612
FIFTEEN POINT SEVEN FOUR

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.881
BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S INTO A

00:34:43.948 --> 00:34:45.616
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN DOLLARS.

00:34:45.683 --> 00:34:46.484
AND THAT'S FOR CONSTRUCTION

00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:48.019
MITIGATION.

00:34:48.085 --> 00:34:50.822
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

00:34:50.888 --> 00:34:51.722
THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES A CONCERT

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:53.090
OR A CONSERVATIVE THIRD.

00:34:53.157 --> 00:34:55.059
CONSTRUCTION CONTINGENCY.

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:56.661
MEANING WE HAVE ADDED THIRTY SIX

00:34:56.727 --> 00:34:57.995
PERCENT TO THE COST DOES A SAFE

00:34:58.062 --> 00:35:00.298
BUT FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE MOST

00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:01.866
CURRENT EVALUATION OF RISKS

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:03.100
INVOLVED WITH TUNNELING AND

00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:05.169
CONSTRUCTION OF THIS TYPE.

00:35:05.236 --> 00:35:06.504
THE ESTIMATE ITSELF IS ALSO

00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:07.772
CONSERVATIVE WE HAVE THREE

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.273
DIFFERENT ESTIMATES FROM THREE

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.975
DIFFERENT INDUSTRY EXPERTS THAT

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:11.976
ARE USING THREE DIFFERENT

00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:13.277
INDUSTRY STANDARD AND RISK

00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:15.646
ADJUSTED METHODS. WE ARE USING

00:35:15.713 --> 00:35:17.515
THE HIGHEST OF THE THREE.

00:35:17.582 --> 00:35:18.783
WE ARE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.985
UPDATING OUR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

00:35:21.052 --> 00:35:22.520
OF THIS UPDATE WILL PROVIDE A

00:35:22.587 --> 00:35:23.988
BENEFIT COST ANALYSIS FOR THE NO

PHONE NINE THOUSAND CUBIC FEET

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:27.458
PER SECOND PROJECT.

00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:29.126
AS AN UPDATE OUR EARLIER WORK

00:35:29.193 --> 00:35:30.495
WHICH WAS AN AGGREGATE OF

00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:32.230
BENEFITS AND COSTS THIS PROJECT

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:33.197
WILL LOOK SEPARATELY AT

00:35:33.264 --> 00:35:34.165
DIFFERENT GROUPS WITHIN THE

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:35.566
STATE WATER PROJECT AS WELL AS

00:35:35.633 --> 00:35:37.068

AND CERTAINLY NOBODY SITTING UP

00:54:21.191 --> 00:54:23.159
HERE HAS HEARD ABOUT. THAT ST

00:54:23.226 --> 00:54:24.995

AS PART OF OUR WATER FIX

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.194
COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM.

00:54:58.261 --> 00:55:01.297
THE DEPARTMENT DISCUSSED THE.

THE FALL IS.

00:55:13.443 --> 00:55:15.378
THE WATER CONTRACTORS

00:55:15.445 --> 00:55:17.180
THEMSELVES NEEDED TO GO TO THEIR

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:18.748
BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND HAVE.

00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:20.216
THOSE DISCUSSIONS.

00:55:27.624 --> 00:55:28.158
NOT.

00:55:28.224 --> 00:55:28.725
IT WAS GONNA PENCIL OUT FOR

00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:29.259
THEM.

00:55:29.325 --> 00:55:31.327
AND AS YOU POINTED OUT DIE IN

00:55:31.394 --> 00:55:32.962
YOUR INTRODUCTION.

00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:36.232
THAT CONVERSATION WENT ON ALL

00:55:36.299 --> 00:55:39.169
THROUGHOUT THE FALL A WE HAD A

00:55:39.235 --> 00:55:39.803
MAJOR.

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:40.970
CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT

00:55:41.037 --> 00:55:42.572
CONTRACTOR OPT NOT TO

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:43.773
PARTICIPATE.

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.709
ON THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION FELT

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:47.944
THAT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT AFTER.

00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:49.913
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:51.414
DOLLARS SPENT ON PLANNING COSTS

00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:52.682
THAT OTHER STATE WATER

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:55.218
CONTRACTORS GO AHEAD AND.

00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:57.120
HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH THEIR

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:58.221
BOARDS AND INDICATE THEIR

00:55:58.288 --> 00:56:00.824
INTEREST BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT.

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:03.560
AND THAT HAS LED US TO THE

00:56:03.626 --> 00:56:05.495
SERIES OF VOTES THAT WE ARE NOW

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:07.997
IN A WITH THOSE WATER BOARDS.

00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:11.267
AND CERTAINLY LEAD TO A.

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:13.503
RENEWED INTEREST IF YOU WILL

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:14.104
AND.

00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:16.539
AND ARRANGING FOR THE

00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:18.274
FORMALIZATION OF THIS JOINT

00:56:18.341 --> 00:56:20.110
POWERS AUTHORITY SO.

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:23.279
IT REALLY WASN'T UNTIL PARTIES

00:56:23.346 --> 00:56:24.948
WERE SURE THAT THEY WANTED TO.

00:56:25.014 --> 00:56:26.716
ACTUALLY INVEST IN THE PROJECT

00:56:26.783 --> 00:56:27.851
AND THAT WE COULD DEFINE THE

00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:29.953
PROJECT AS YOU POINTED OUT MORE

00:56:30.019 --> 00:56:30.987
CONCRETELY.

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:32.956
IN KEEPING WITH OUR OUR

00:56:33.022 --> 00:56:33.823
PETITION IN FRONT OF THE WATER

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:35.125
BOARD THAT.

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:37.193
THE CONVERSATION AROUND A JPA

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:38.261
BECAME.

00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:40.497
MUCH MORE TANGIBLE SO.

00:56:40.563 --> 00:56:41.898
SO A COUPLE OF THINGS.

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:43.566
ONE IS.

00:56:43.633 --> 00:56:45.735
THE STATE THROUGH ITS.

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:48.705
EXERCISE OF A A JOINT EXERCISE

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:52.008
OF POWER WITH THE JPA WILL HAVE

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:53.743
AN IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT MECHANISM

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:54.878
AND ALL THE CONSTRUCTION

00:56:54.944 --> 00:56:57.247
STANDARDS UP MAKING SURE THAT

00:56:57.313 --> 00:56:59.249
RISK IS MANAGED APPROPRIATELY.

00:56:59.315 --> 00:57:01.551
WE CERTAINLY AGREE THAT.

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:03.286
PROJECTS OF THE SCALE.

00:57:03.353 --> 00:57:05.288
HAVE A TRACK RECORD FOR GOING

00:57:05.355 --> 00:57:06.623
OVER BUDGET SOMETIMES

00:57:06.689 --> 00:57:08.358
SIGNIFICANTLY OVER BUDGET.

00:57:08.424 --> 00:57:11.127
WE BELIEVED THAT WE BELIEVE

00:57:11.194 --> 00:57:12.729
THAT OUR.

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:13.429
DIDN'T SEE IS.

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:15.365
.

00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:18.668
IT IS IS LARGE AND REFLECTIVE OF

00:57:18.735 --> 00:57:20.370
SOME OF THE RISKS IN A TUNNELING

00:57:20.436 --> 00:57:22.372
PROJECTS WE'VE DONE A LOT OF

00:57:22.438 --> 00:57:25.008
RESEARCH ON TUNNEL PROJECTS OF A

00:57:25.074 --> 00:57:26.342
COMPARABLE NATURE.

00:57:26.409 --> 00:57:28.778
TO ARRIVE AT THAT.

00:57:28.845 --> 00:57:31.648
THIRTY SIX PERCENT CONTINGENCY.

00:57:31.714 --> 00:57:33.783
SO WE BELIEVE WE'RE DOING.

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:36.252
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PRE PLANNING.

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:38.822
TO HELP US FROM THE BEGINNING

00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:40.456
ON CONTROL COSTS IN AND MANAGE

00:57:40.523 --> 00:57:41.691
RISKS.

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:43.960
THE. CALIFORNIA WATER

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:45.695
COMMISSION OF DOES HAVE AN

00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:48.164
IMPORTANT ROLE IN OVERSEEING.

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:51.134
THE FACILITY OF THE STATE WATER

00:57:51.201 --> 00:57:52.569
PARK THE FACILITIES OF THE STATE

00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:54.737
WATER PROJECT NOT LONG AGO WE'VE.

00:57:54.804 --> 00:57:56.272
PRESENTED TO THEM THE

00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:57.574
DEPARTMENT'S IDEAS ON ASSET

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:58.441
MANAGEMENT.

00:57:58.508 --> 00:58:00.577
THEY'VE HAD A PRESENTATION ON

00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:02.812
OF THE OROVILLE A SITUATION AND

00:58:02.879 --> 00:58:04.047
WHAT NEEDS TO.

00:58:04.113 --> 00:58:05.481
WHAT IT NEEDS TO OCCUR?

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:07.917
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PART OF

00:58:07.984 --> 00:58:09.219
THE STATE WATER PROJECT IS

00:58:09.285 --> 00:58:11.421
OPERATED TO MAXIMUM PUBLIC

00:58:11.487 --> 00:58:12.622
SAFETY.

00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:15.158
SO THAT IS A AN OPPORTUNITY I

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:16.726
THINK AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY

00:58:16.793 --> 00:58:18.228
FOR TRANSPARENT AND AND.

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:20.430
TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT.

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:23.233
THE JPA ITSELF A IN

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:24.234
COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:27.203
OF WATER RESOURCES WILL IDENTIFY

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:29.439
OPPORTUNITIES FOR.

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:31.441
THE PUBLIC ESPECIALLY IMPACTED

00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:34.043
COMMUNITIES TO INTERACT DIRECTLY

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:35.879
WITH THE JPA PARTICULARLY ON ON

00:58:35.945 --> 00:58:38.114
DESIGN ISSUES WHICH ARE GOING TO

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:39.582
BE A MATTER OF.

00:58:39.649 --> 00:58:41.818
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION.

00:58:41.885 --> 00:58:43.987
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT.

00:58:44.053 --> 00:58:45.889
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF.

00:58:45.955 --> 00:58:47.924
.

00:58:47.991 --> 00:58:50.326
OF CERTIFYING OUR CONSISTENCY

00:58:50.393 --> 00:58:51.027
WITH THE DELTA PLAN THERE'S

00:58:51.094 --> 00:58:53.429
IMPORTANT DELTA AS PLACE KINDS

00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:55.265
OF REQUIREMENTS THERE.

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:56.766
THAT WILL BE SPELLED OUT.

00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:59.369
IN IN THAT SETTING AS WELL.

00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:00.603
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:03.339
RESOURCES WILL BE IMPLEMENTING A

00:59:03.406 --> 00:59:04.974
WILL BE HELPING THE A JOINT

00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:06.442
POWERS AUTHORITY TO.

00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:08.244
IMPLEMENT ALL OF THOSE

00:59:08.311 --> 00:59:11.314
MECHANISMS AND I PROVIDE FOR A

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:12.815
FAIR AND TRANSPARENT.

00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:15.251
OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT AND.

00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:17.654
AND PROVIDE INPUT INTO THE

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:21.858
DESIGN.

00:59:21.925 --> 00:59:26.195
BUT BUT I MEAN I APPRECIATE. THE

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:28.064
REITERATION DID THAT. IT IS CAN

00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:28.731
WE TALK ABOUT DELTA'S PLACE THAT

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:29.265
I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:30.667
ANYBODY IN THE DELTA WHO WHO WHO

00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:32.669
TRUST THE PROJECT.

00:59:32.735 --> 00:59:33.703
AND SO THAT THAT REMAINS A

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:35.338
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE ESPECIALLY AS

00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:38.474
YOU KNOW AS AS I. AS I AS I SIT

00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:40.543
IN THAT IN THAT COMMUNITY.

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:42.145
AND THE.

00:59:42.211 --> 00:59:43.212
THE WAY THAT CHANGES HAVE

00:59:43.279 --> 00:59:44.414
OCCURRED DON'T MAKE ANYBODY FEEL

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.383
COMFORTABLE AND THE THE IDEA OF.

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:49.085
THIS MASSIVE GPA WITH SO MANY

00:59:49.152 --> 00:59:50.653
UNKNOWNS.

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.756
LEAVES A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY

00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:54.357
UNCOMFORTABLE AND I THINK IT

00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:54.924
SHOULD LEAVE EVERY LAWMAKER

00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:55.892
SITTING UP HERE.

00:59:55.959 --> 00:59:57.627
WHO HAS TO WORRY ABOUT AND EVEN

00:59:57.694 --> 00:59:58.761
THOUGH YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE NOT

00:59:58.828 --> 01:00:00.296
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERRUNS I

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:01.397
CAN TELL YOU AT THE END OF THE

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:02.699
DAY THE PUBLIC LOOKS TO THE

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:04.167
LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO?

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:05.668
MANAGE THE STATE'S MONEY AND

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:06.869
MANAGE THE STATE'S RESOURCES IN

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:09.906
AN APPROPRIATE FASHION.

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:11.140
RUSSIANS WERE ANYONE ELSE.

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:13.876
PHONE.

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:15.144
UP THE SURLY REPRESENTING A

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:16.446
COMMUNITY AND KERN COUNTY SOUTH

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:18.514
OF DELTA AND TO WHAT EXTENT ARE

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:20.750
WE. NOT PUMPING WATER FROM

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:22.919
EXISTING FACILITIES AT MAXIMUM

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:23.820
CAPACITY BECAUSE OF THE BALLOTS

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:26.222
COMPANIONS SO PRESUME THAT CAL

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.124
ARE TOUGHER Y. FACES.

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:30.026
AND BUILD A DOZEN ABOUT LIKE

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:31.127
DON'T DON'T WE STILL HAVE THE BY

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:32.328
BY THOSE BIOLOGICAL PAINS AS

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:33.596
WELL SO WHAT ASSURANCES DO WE

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:35.164
HAVE THAT MORE WATER IS ACTUALLY

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:36.432
GOING TO.

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:37.500
THE DEBATE.

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:39.702
SO I'M WE DO HAVE TO ABIDE BY

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:41.137
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AND OF

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:42.939
COURSE WATER FIX HAS ITS OWN SET

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:44.607
OF BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THAT.

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:45.875
STIPULATE WHEN.

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:48.311
WE CAN MOVE WATER IN CALIFORNIA

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:49.212
AND I THINK.

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:51.781
SIR THAT. TO ME THE MOST KIND A

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:53.783
TANGIBLE EXAMPLE OF.

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.219
A PRETTY COMPLICATED SYSTEM.

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:57.787
THAT SPEAKS TO THE BENEFIT OF

01:00:57.854 --> 01:00:59.188
THE PROJECT IN TERMS OF WATER

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:00.790
SUPPLIES IS.

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:01.791
IN.

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:03.526
JANUARY FEBRUARY OF TWENTY

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:05.862
SIXTEEN YOU ALL RECALL WE WERE

01:01:05.928 --> 01:01:07.830
SOMEWHAT EMERGING FROM A DROUGHT

01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:08.564
WE HAD.

01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:11.300
SEVERAL A FLASHY STORMS MOVING

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:12.735
THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:15.471
AND IN THAT PERIOD WE WERE NOT

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:17.974
ABLE TO MOVE OUT WATER BECAUSE

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:19.542
OF THE INHERENT CONFLICT.

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:20.243
BETWEEN.

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:22.912
SPECIES DOWN IN THE SOUTH DELTA

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:24.380
AND AND THE LOCATION OF THOSE

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:26.182
PUMPS SO ONCE SPECIES ARE

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:28.151
DETECTED IN A IN THE VICINITY

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:28.651
THAT'S WHEN.

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:31.888
THE PROJECT OPERATORS STARTED

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:33.856
TO TURN DOWN THE PUMPING

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:36.025
CAPACITY. IN THAT TWO MONTH

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:36.559
PERIOD.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:39.762
HAD THE TUNNELS BEEN ONLINE WE

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:41.798
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:43.833
THE PROTECTIVE CRITERIA IN THE

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.635
SOUTH DELTA.

01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:46.569
USE THE NORTH DELTA DO

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:48.571
DIVERSIONS AND MOVE ABOUT FOUR

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:49.839
HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND ACRE

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:51.274
FEET OF WATER I WANT TO

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.843
EMPHASIZE DURING A TIME OF YEAR

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:55.244
WHEN WE HAVE SO MUCH WATER

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:57.246
MOVING THROUGH THE SYSTEM. THAT

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:58.948
WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SPECIFIC

01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:00.316
OUTFLOW REQUIREMENTS TO MEET

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:01.551
BECAUSE AGAIN THESE ARE LARGE

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:03.486
STORM EVENTS THERE'S A LOT OF

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:04.887
WATER MOVING THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:07.490
TO ME THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF THE

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.459
OPPORTUNITY OF THE PROJECT FOR

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:11.260
WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY OVER

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:13.362
TIME AS FOLKS HAVE POINTED OUT.

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:16.499
OVERALL THIS PROJECT DOES NOT

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:18.601
HIDE GENERATE SIGNIFICANT

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:19.202
AMOUNTS OF QUOTE UNQUOTE NEW

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:21.938
WATER BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS IT

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:24.307
PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY. SO

01:02:24.373 --> 01:02:25.575
THAT IN THE FUTURE WHEN WE HAVE

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:28.044
LARGE STORM EVENTS WE CAN MOVE

01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:29.312
THAT WATER IN A WAY THAT SAFER

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:30.646
FOR FISH.

01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:32.014
AND WE CAN STORE IT.

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:34.784
IN LOCAL SERVICE AREAS OR IN

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:36.886
STATE RESERVOIRS OF FOR USE

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:37.487
DURING.

01:02:37.553 --> 01:02:39.655
WHAT WE ANTICIPATE TO BE LONGER

01:02:39.722 --> 01:02:42.625
DROUGHT PERIODS?

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:43.025
SO.

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:45.328
IN TERMS OF SO IN TERMS OF JUST

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:47.530
NUMBERS AND YOU YOU INDICATED

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.132
THAT JUST EXAMPLE FROM JANUARY

01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:51.067
FABRICS Y. SIXTEEN YOU PUT YOU

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.902
ESTIMATE THAT FOR EIGHTY

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:53.469
THOUSAND ACRE FEET WOULD BE

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:54.604
MOVED.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:57.940
WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN MOVED MORE

01:02:58.007 --> 01:02:58.407
INCENTIVE AT GO OUT?

01:02:58.474 --> 01:02:59.442
TWO OTHER FACILITY ONLY OUT TO

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:02.078
THE OCEAN CORRECT CORRECT WITH.

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:04.347
EXISTED WITH IMPROVEMENTS TO

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:05.381
SPECIES PROTECTIONS IN THE SOUTH

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:06.782
DELTA

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:08.284
AND IN A WAY THAT'S SAFE FOR

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:10.419
FISH I WITH THE OPERATION OF OF

01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:10.653
THE NEW.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.589
INTAKES.

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:14.724
AND JUST THAT MY CURIOSITY.

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:17.660
BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF WATERS

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:19.729
THAT WE HAVE NOW WHY ARE WE NOT

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:21.030
PUMPING AND AND TO A LARGE

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:22.431
CAPACITY RIGHT NOW OR HIGHER

01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:23.232
CAPACITY.

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:24.934
WELL WE HAVE THESE INHERENT

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:27.637
CONFLICTS OF WHEN WE HAVE SPENT

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:28.538
AS I MENTIONED WHEN WE HAVE

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:31.140
FISHERIES. A IN THE VICINITY OF

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:33.843
THE PUMPS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO.

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:36.379
TO OPERATE THOSE PUMPS WITHOUT.

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:37.680
OF HARMING THEM UNDER THAT THE

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:40.516
DEFINITION OF A OF STATE FEDERAL

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:41.884
LAWS IN OUR CONDITIONS ARE

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:43.419
CONDITIONS FOR THOSE PERMITS.

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.621
THERE ARE ALSO IMPORTANT

01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:45.855
QUALITY.

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:47.390
.

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:50.026
CONTROLS IN THE DELTA THAT ALSO

01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:51.594
DETERMINE WHEN WE CAN I MOVE

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:52.862
WATER OUT OF THOSE PUMPS IN THE

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:53.863
SOUTH DELTA.

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:55.464
THE PUMPS IN THE SOUTH DELTA

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:57.500
ACTUALLY DRAW WATER INTO THE

01:03:57.567 --> 01:03:58.834
SYSTEM FRESH WATER INTO THE

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:00.403
SYSTEM THAT AND A MORE NATURAL

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:02.171
SYSTEM IN ALL LIKELIHOOD

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:03.272
WOULDN'T BE THERE BUT THERE ARE

01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:04.907
A LOT OF BENEFICIAL USES THAT

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:07.109
HAVE. GENERATED AROUND THAT THE

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:08.644
HOT NAMELY A LOT OF OTHER

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:10.246
COMMUNITIES IN THE DELTA SO

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:12.315
THOSE WATER QUALITY RESTRICTIONS

01:04:12.381 --> 01:04:13.416
ARE ALSO.

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:15.851
IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY ON THE

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:17.153
CURRENT OPERATIONS OF THE

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.387
PROJECTS THAT.

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:20.523
UP PREVENT THE DIVERSION OF OF

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.358
MORE WATER. THE.

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:23.759
OTHERS SAY THAT ENDED UP BECAUSE

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:26.395
CERTAINLY THAT THE.

01:04:26.462 --> 01:04:27.830
PRO THE BENEFITS OF THE CAL

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:29.765
WATER FIX IF THE ESTIMATES ARE

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:31.200
CORRECT IS THAT WE DO ARE WE ARE

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:32.802
MOVING MORE WATER. I THINK THE

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:34.770
CHALLENGES ARE THAT IF WE DON'T

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:36.872
ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE PUMPING AND

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:37.440
WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY PUMPING.

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:39.575
BECAUSE.

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:42.411
OF VARIOUS REASONS AND WE BUILT

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:43.713
A FACILITY THAT IS A PUMPING

01:04:43.779 --> 01:04:45.281
WATER AND THEN THAT'S THAT'S MY

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:46.482
BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:48.551
NOT MOVING WATER AND OUT

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:49.185
COMMUNITIES THAT NEED WATER ARE

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:51.187
GETTING.

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:53.556
AND IF I COULD JUST.

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:54.690
THE FOLLOW UP BECAUSE SO IT IS

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:55.925
USED IN ESSENCE WHAT YOU'RE

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:58.628
SAYING IS IS. GOING TO SPEND.

01:04:58.694 --> 01:05:00.396
SEVENTEEN BILLION POTENTIALLY A

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:01.664
WHOLE LOT MORE OUGHT TO BE ABLE

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:03.032
TO CAPTURE SOME WATER DURING

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:06.369
TIMES OF STORM. ARM AND AND THEN

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:07.203
WHEN YOU SEE CAN EITHER USE IT

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:08.571
AND AND RESERVOIRS BUT IT CAN

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:09.672
ALSO BE BANKED HEAT TO SELL

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:10.573
LATER CORRECT.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.708
SO A STORM WATER COULD THEN BE

01:05:12.775 --> 01:05:13.743
UNDERGROUND BANK IN ORDER TO BE

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:14.844
ABLE TO SELL TO ANOTHER WATER

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:16.312
CONTRACTOR LATER.

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:17.446
WELL THOSE THOSE WATER

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:18.981
CONTRACTORS ACTUALLY THEY HAVE

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:20.483
THEIR CONTRACT AMOUNT WITH.

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:23.319
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:23.619
RESOURCES.

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:25.187
AND WE DO HAVE A TRANSFER

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:26.322
PROGRAM.

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:29.225
AND. OTHERS WATER SUPPLIES HAVE

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:30.626
TO ABIDE BY.

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:32.862
OLIVER TRANSFER RULES.

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:35.231
THAT REQUIRE SEQUEL AND OTHER

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:36.999
ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTATION SO I

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:38.567
DON'T. I DON'T.

01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:41.270
CONSIDER WATER FIX PROVIDING

01:05:41.337 --> 01:05:42.305
ANY.

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:44.507
ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY THEN.

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:46.876
WHAT'S OTHERWISE AVAILABLE TO

01:05:46.942 --> 01:05:50.313
PARTIES TODAY IN TERMS OF OF.

01:05:50.379 --> 01:05:53.015
TRANSFERRING WATER.

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:54.583
EUROPE IN A JUST. MY OTHER

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:55.885
QUESTIONS YOU YOU.

01:05:55.951 --> 01:05:57.586
YOU TALKED ABOUT.

01:05:57.653 --> 01:05:58.788
YOU KNOW WE COULD START

01:05:58.854 --> 01:06:00.890
RESERVOIRS IN A AS SOMEONE WHO

01:06:00.956 --> 01:06:03.125
IS VERY ACTIVE ENOUGH ON.

01:06:03.192 --> 01:06:04.894
ABOUT ONE AND I NEGOTIATIONS FOR

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.594
THE.

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:07.830
THE WATER BOND WE DID AND THAT

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:09.065
WAS A YOU KNOW. GROUP OF MONEY

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:10.433
IN THERE FOR RESERVOIRS.

01:06:10.499 --> 01:06:12.268
AND I HEAR A LOT OF COMPLAINTS

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:14.170
pTHAT WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ON

01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:15.805
THAT YET.

01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:17.440
WITH THAT MONEY SET ASIDE WE'RE

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:19.442
NOT MOVING AT AND YET WE HAVE A

01:06:19.508 --> 01:06:20.910
GOOD POTENTIALLY ANOTHER

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:22.411
SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AGAIN

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:24.013
IN A PROJECT THAT. HAS A LOT OF

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.314
UNKNOWNS WITH ITS TO.

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:27.950
MISTER BRAZIER.

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:28.684
SHARE.

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:32.455
GOOD MORNING.

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:33.989
SO WE LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:35.157
COMPLEXITY OF THIS PROJECT IN

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:36.425
AND POTENTIALLY EIGHTY MILES OF

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.160
TUNNELS.

01:06:38.227 --> 01:06:38.994
OF GOING THROUGH.

01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:41.297
.

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:43.632
UNPREDICTABLE SOILS GAS WELLS

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:45.601
THOUSANDS OF GAS WELLS.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:46.135
THROUGH THIS THROUGH THIS

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:47.403
COMPLEX.

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.703
MARRIOTT OF.

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:49.572
.

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:51.307
SIDON SOON ALL OF THESE ISSUES

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:52.875
GOING FORWARD WE JUST HAD A

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:54.477
PROJECT ON HOW WE TWELVE THAT

01:06:54.543 --> 01:06:56.946
WAS FULLY ENGINEERED AND FAILED.

01:06:57.012 --> 01:06:58.080
AND THEY HAD TO RE ENGINEER AND

01:06:58.147 --> 01:06:59.949
TRY TO FIX.

01:07:00.015 --> 01:07:01.350
WHAT THEY IN ENGINEERED?

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:03.419
AND THEN YOU AND YOU LOOK AT

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:05.187
THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:07.390
HAD MEGA PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:10.326
AND THEY'VE SAID THE SAME THING

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:12.261
OVER AND OVER THAT WE PUT A RISK

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:13.562
FACTOR IN.

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:17.066
AND IT NEVER EVEN CAME CLOSE TO.

01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:18.434
BROWN BAY BRIDGE IS WHAT FIVE

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:19.635
TIMES OVER.

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:21.904
HIGH SPEED RAIL KNOWS.

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:23.105
THREE TIMES OVER.

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:25.708
.

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:27.009
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO GO TO THE

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:28.744
PUBLIC AND SELL THEM.

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:29.912
THAT THAT'S GOING TO COST TAX

01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:32.248
AND THEN END UP COSTING Z..

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:34.016
I JUST THAT'S JUST.

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.085
UNCONSCIONABLE.

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:37.520
AND THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:39.255
ABILITY FOR THE LEGISLATIVE

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:40.322
OVERSIGHT OF PROJECTS OF THIS

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:41.757
ENORMITY.

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:43.526
TO BE ABLE TO SAY ENOUGH IS

01:07:43.592 --> 01:07:45.561
ENOUGH WHAT HAS A TENDENCY IS WE

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:46.796
GET INVOLVED IN THESE PROJECTS

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:48.030
TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND YOU GET

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:50.766
TO THE TIPPING POINT.

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:51.267
AND THEN ALSO WE HAVE TO

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:52.868
CONTINUE.

01:07:52.935 --> 01:07:54.904
YOU GET US INVESTED INTO A POINT

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:55.971
WHERE WHERE WERE WOULD JUST WE

01:07:56.038 --> 01:07:57.940
HAVE TO GO ON.

01:07:58.007 --> 01:07:59.408
THAT'S NOT FAIR SOB FAIR TO US

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:00.509
IS NOT FAIR TO THE OTHER THE

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.445
TAXPAYERS.

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:03.078
WHEN YOU LOOK AT BECAUSE OF THIS

01:08:03.145 --> 01:08:04.814
SIZE.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.550
AND THE DEBT SERVICE THAT THIS

01:08:07.616 --> 01:08:09.251
WILL. POTENTIALLY.

01:08:09.318 --> 01:08:11.654
A OCCUR.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.522
HOW DO YOU PAY FOR IT WHEN YOU

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:15.791
HAVE A SAY GOD FOR BID A DECADE?

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:21.464
LONG DROUGHT.

01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:23.065
I AM. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I

01:08:23.132 --> 01:08:24.066
THINK IN A PART OF OUR

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:25.434
CALCULATION IS YOU KNOW WHAT'S

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:28.137
THE COST OF NOT DOING.

01:08:28.204 --> 01:08:31.307
A PROJECT AND NOT FIXING ON THE

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:32.708
ABILITY OF THE DELTA CONVEYANCE

01:08:32.775 --> 01:08:35.444
SYSTEM TO PROVIDE WATER SUPPLIES.

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:37.680
AND THE CHALLENGES I I QUITE

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:38.047
AGREE WITH YOU.

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:40.049
.

01:08:40.115 --> 01:08:42.017
AND I THINK ARE INTERESTED IN

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:43.719
HAVING LEARNED FROM THE BAY

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.421
BRIDGE AND OTHER BIG PROJECTS

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:46.555
THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE THESE

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:47.990
OVERAGES.

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:49.692
BUT.

01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:51.627
WE BELIEVE THAT AFTER LOOKING AT

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:53.429
ALL THE INFORMATION.

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:57.433
IT'S OUR OUR DUTY TO UPGRADE

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.501
THE SYSTEM.

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:00.569
THAT CAN PROVIDE RELIABLE WATER

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:01.804
SUPPLIES IN.

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:04.240
IN THE MOST AFFORDABLE WAY AND

01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:05.574
THAT'S GOING TO BE OUR GOAL AS

01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:06.942
WE MANAGE THROUGH THE

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:08.644
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT.

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:12.014
AND OF. CALIFORNIA'S GONNA

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:13.516
STRUGGLE STRUGGLE ACROSS.

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.951
MULTIPLE WATER SUPPLY SOURCES

01:09:16.018 --> 01:09:17.486
IN THE EVENT OF A DROUGHT.

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:18.754
WHICH IS WHY.

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:21.257
WE HAD OUR PROP ONE.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:24.026
PASSED SO SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:25.828
TO INSURE THAT WE ARE INVESTING

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.563
AND ALL OF THOSE PORT FOLIO

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:29.665
KINDS OF WATER SUPPLIES. BECAUSE

01:09:29.732 --> 01:09:31.033
YOU KNOW REALLY THE WAVE OF THE

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.469
FUTURE IS THE DIVERSITY OF THE

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:34.970
DIVERSITY WATER SUPPLIES THAT

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:36.505
ARE PROVIDED ACROSS CALIFORNIA

01:09:36.572 --> 01:09:38.274
BECAUSE THAT'S THE. THAT'S THE

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.209
BEST BULWARK AGAINST.

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:41.810
A LONG TERM DROUGHT CLUB

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:43.345
SCENARIO SO.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:45.414
.

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:46.749
I THINK OUR WHOLE CHALLENGES HOW

01:09:46.815 --> 01:09:48.150
WE MANAGE RISK AND THERE'S A

01:09:48.217 --> 01:09:51.120
RISK TO DOING NOTHING AND AFTER

01:09:51.186 --> 01:09:53.055
A DECADE OR SO IT'S OF THE STUDY

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:54.757
IN PRE PLANNING. WE BELIEVE THAT

01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:56.292
THIS IS A PROJECT THAT.

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:58.527
MITIGATES RISK SHIRT CHEN

01:09:58.594 --> 01:09:59.995
GENERATES OTHER RISK IN TERMS OF

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:00.763
CONSTRUCTION.

01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:02.831
BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT A REASON

01:10:02.898 --> 01:10:05.000
TO TO NOT GO FORWARD UP FROM OUR

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:05.301
PERSPECTIVE

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:06.936
OKAY.

01:10:07.002 --> 01:10:09.004
SO YOU KNOW.

01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:10.005
ALSO YOU LOOK AT.

01:10:10.072 --> 01:10:12.508
THE DELTA PROTECTION ACT OF

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:14.643
NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE.

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:16.478
WHICH REQUIRES A DELTA NEEDS.

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:18.414
CONTINUED TO BE NET AS EXPORTS

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.215
OCCUR IN THIS WATER CODE SECTION

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:22.084
ONE TWO TWO EXACTS.

01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:23.385
AND IS BOLSTERED BY THE MANDATE

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:26.522
TO REDUCE DELTA RELIANCE.

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:27.856
ALL EMPHASIZE REDUCED DELTA

01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:30.092
RELIANCE ON EXPORTS TO ME

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:32.461
CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE WATER NEEDS.

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:33.662
WORKERS SECTION EIGHTY FIVE OH

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:35.097
TO ONE.

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:36.398
SO WHERE WE CONTINUE TO PUSH HIS

01:10:36.465 --> 01:10:38.267
AGENDA. IS NOT EVEN COMPLY WITH

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:40.502
THEIR OWN LAWS

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:41.670
NOW WE'VE AS THE MAN CHARITY

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:44.506
INDICATED THIS LEGISLATURE VOTED

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:46.241
TO PUT THE WATER BOND OUT WITH

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:47.343
THE AGREEMENT THAT WE WERE GONNA

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:48.844
GET STORAGE. OUT OF THAT THEN

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:50.045
THE WATER COMMISSION NOW IS

01:10:50.112 --> 01:10:51.880
DECLARED THAT IT DOESN'T MEET

01:10:51.947 --> 01:10:54.216
THE PUBLIC NEED SO WE HAVE ONE

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:55.818
AGENCY TELLING. US THAT WOULD

01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:58.220
WHAT WE INTENDED TO VIEWS CANNOT

01:10:58.287 --> 01:10:59.588
BE USED FOR NOW.

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:01.624
AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THESE THESE

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:03.492
LAWS WE PUT IN PLACE.

01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:04.927
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'RE NOT

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:08.330
REDUCING THE NEED ON THE DELTA.

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:10.366
NO OTHER SEAWATER AGENCIES HAVE.

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.301
SAN DIEGO BUILT THEIR OWN DIESEL

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:14.169
PLANT AT THEIR EXPENSE.

01:11:14.236 --> 01:11:15.104
AND THEY REDUCING THEIR NEED ON

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:17.373
THE DELTA.

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:19.441
THIS INCREASES THE NEED ON THE

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:20.809
DELTA SO. ARE WE BREAKING OUR

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:22.378
OWN LAWS.

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:24.246
WELL WE ARE REQUIRED AS I

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:25.914
MENTIONED WE DO NEED TO.

01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:28.083
PROVIDE CERTIFICATION OF

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:29.685
CONSISTENCY WITH THE DELTA PLAN.

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:30.986
DOCUMENTING.

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:33.355
THIS THOUGH PROJECTS PRODUCES

01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:35.357
ALLIANCE ON THE DELTA IS GOING

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:36.992
TO BE PART OF THAT. MOM

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:39.995
CERTIFICATION AND OF THE PUBLIC

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:41.096
WATER AGENCIES THAT.

01:11:41.163 --> 01:11:43.565
WOULD US SEE THE BENEFIT OF THE

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:43.932
WATER.

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:46.168
OF THE WATER FIX PROJECT WILL

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:49.271
BE PART OF PROVIDING THAT

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:50.205
DOCUMENTATION AND THAT.

01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:52.341
THE. GEORGIA COUNCIL ITSELF

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:56.211
WILL MAKE DETERMINATIONS ON.

01:11:56.278 --> 01:11:57.813
SO YOUSO YOU'RE RIGHT AND.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.082
WE ANTICIPATE DODD DESCRIBING.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.950
THE REDUCE RELIANCE OF

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:02.985
REQUIREMENT AS IT RELATES TO

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:04.186
THIS PROJECT.

01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:06.789
SO.

01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:08.257
FORGIVE ME THE AMBER WE TALK

01:12:08.323 --> 01:12:10.025
ABOUT OTHER AGENCIES MAKING THE

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:11.360
DETERMINATION THOSE ARE

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:13.829
APPOINTMENTS BY ADMINISTRATIONS.

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:15.864
AND SO A THERE HAS BEEN A

01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:17.466
FEVERISH ATTEMPTED TO MAKE SURE

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:19.201
THAT THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN.

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:22.438
AB ARM.

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:24.640
ACCOMPLISHED GOAL.

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:25.507
A BY CERTAIN TIMES THAT.

01:12:25.574 --> 01:12:27.643
A.

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:29.278
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THE

01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:30.979
TROUBLES ME IS THAT. THE

01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:33.415
LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN COMPLETELY

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:35.317
ALIENATED FROM THIS PROCESS WHEN

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:37.086
WE LOOK AT THIS HUGE INVESTMENT.

01:12:37.152 --> 01:12:38.887
GOING FORWARD IN ASISTIR

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:39.788
ACCOMPLISH SCHOOL OF THIS

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:41.457
LEGISLATURE.

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:43.358
TO DO WAY IN.

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:44.359
I MEAN IT'S JUST LIKE THIS THE

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:45.494
SEE AGENCIES ARE TELLING US WHAT

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:46.428
THEY'RE GOING TO DO.

01:12:46.495 --> 01:12:49.531
AND YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:50.466
THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT WHAT I

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:51.934
CAME UP HERE TO BE.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.569
I CAME HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:54.837
THAT THE PEOPLE'S MONEY IS BEING

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:55.904
SPENT AN APPROPRIATE FASHION THE

01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:57.639
BEST.

01:12:57.706 --> 01:12:59.274
OF VALUE GOING FORWARD I DON'T

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:00.275
BELIEVE THIS IS A VALUE.

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:02.244
.

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:03.746
THE OTHER THE OTHER THING IS

01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:05.314
WHEN WE LOOK AT OTHER COMPONENTS

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:06.448
I JUST WONDER WHAT THE PEOPLE

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:07.616
WERE TOLD WHEN THEM PUMPS FOR

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:09.284
PUTTING THAT TRACY. THIS GOING

01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:10.853
TO MAKE THE DELTA BETTER.

01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:11.887
AND THE EARLY FIFTIES OR

01:13:11.954 --> 01:13:13.555
WHATEVER THEY WERE PUT IN.

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:15.023
AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK ONE

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:16.759
MILITANT DAM WAS INSTALLED.

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:20.395
IN THE FRESNO AREA WHO.

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:21.396
THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER DRIVE.

01:13:21.463 --> 01:13:23.365
OR SIXTY MILES

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:23.966
THAT WAS THE SOUTHERN PUSH TO

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:25.934
THE DELTA.

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:27.770
SO WE KEEP TELLING PEOPLE OF

01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:30.172
THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING.

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:31.406
BUT THE ONLY THING THAT I'M

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:33.509
SEEING HERE IS THAT.

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:34.810
THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE ECONOMY

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:36.578
WILL FLOURISH WILL A ONE THIRD

01:13:36.645 --> 01:13:38.680
OF THE ECONOMY WILL BE DAMAGED.

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:39.314
AND THAT'S MY AREA I LIVE IN THE

01:13:39.381 --> 01:13:41.583
DELTA.

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.152
SLOWLY READ A ERROR SALINITY

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:44.620
WILL RISE IN THE DELTA.

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:45.687
IF YOU'RE TAKING NINE THOUSAND

01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:46.488
CUBIC FEET KNOW WHAT IS SEVEN

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:48.657
GALLONS.

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:49.758
NINE THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:52.361
MINUTE.

01:13:52.427 --> 01:13:53.729
HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF GALLONS IS

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:55.364
THAT TAKING OUT OF THE RIVER?

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:57.533
AND INTO CONVEYANCE.

01:13:57.599 --> 01:13:59.001
AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO

01:13:59.067 --> 01:14:00.302
HAVE A DRAMATIC EFFECT ON BRING

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:03.372
SALINITY UP INTO THE DELTA.

01:14:03.438 --> 01:14:05.507
INTO MY FARM'S WERE MY FARMS ARE

01:14:05.574 --> 01:14:07.509
SOME OF THE CROPS ARE VERY.

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:09.278
SALTER SALINITY SENSITIVITY

01:14:09.344 --> 01:14:11.346
CAN'T PLANT ANYMORE OR THE

01:14:11.413 --> 01:14:13.115
ABUNDANCE ASSAULTS WILL NOW

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:14.049
BUILD UP IN THE SOILS IN THERE

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:18.620
AND THIS WAS WILL BE. USELESS.

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:19.788
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF HYDRO

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:21.490
MODELING WHO'S DONE.

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:22.457
BUT I MEAN WHEN I WAS A LITTLE

01:14:22.524 --> 01:14:23.759
GUY.

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:25.494
THE SALINITY BARRIER OF THE

01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:27.596
SLOUGH DEMARCATION LINE WAS THAT.

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:30.432
THE THE CROCKETT BRIDGE.

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:33.168
NOW THREE MILE SLOUGH.

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:35.103
IT'S GONE UP MILES ALREADY AND

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:36.939
WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW DIMINISH

01:14:37.005 --> 01:14:39.107
FLOWS IN ALL OF THIS.

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:40.175
WELL YOU DIMINISH THE FLORIDA

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:41.610
THAT THROUGH THE SOUTHERN DELTA

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:44.346
YOU'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO HURT.

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:45.347
THE FARMERS ARE GONNA HURT FISH

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:45.948
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE FRESH

01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:47.850
WATER FLUSH.

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:50.485
AND SO. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT

01:14:50.552 --> 01:14:52.955
EARTHQUAKES WAS THAT VINCE

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:53.522
PLENTY OF EARTHQUAKES WE'VE

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:54.857
NEVER HAD A LEVEE FAILURE TO AN

01:14:54.923 --> 01:14:55.490
EARTHQUAKE.

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:56.859
AND WE TALK ABOUT ALL THIS

01:14:56.925 --> 01:14:58.827
OTHER STUFF.

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:00.929
BUT WE SEE. AGAIN WE CAN HAVE A

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:01.897
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION HOW YOU

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:03.665
GET TO ACTS.

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:05.534
BUT.

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:07.236
WITHOUT IT CREATING A.

01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:09.838
ONE DROP OF NEW WATER.

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:11.707
TO ME IS SO FOOLISH.

01:15:11.773 --> 01:15:13.208
WHEN WE HAVE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:14.977
IN OUR PROVEN YOU TAKE A

01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:16.912
SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS.

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:19.948
FIFTEEN D. SELF LANCE.

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:20.816
FRESH WATER

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:23.252
NEW WATER.

01:15:23.318 --> 01:15:24.486
I MEAN WE HAVE DE COMMISSION

01:15:24.553 --> 01:15:26.321
POWER PLANTS ON ARE DELTA RIGHT

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:27.422
NOW IN PITTSBURGH IN ANY ACT

01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:29.424
THAT HAVE DISTILLING PROCESS IS.

01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:30.959
IN PLACE.

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:34.429
THAT WE CAN UTILIZE.

01:15:34.496 --> 01:15:35.931
THERE'S THE COMMISSION BAD TO

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:36.832
DISTILL THE WATERS WOULDN'T RUIN

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:39.234
THEIR PIPES.

01:15:39.301 --> 01:15:41.270
SO AGAIN I SEE THIS MYOPIC PUSH

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:43.505
TO THIS PROJECT.

01:15:43.572 --> 01:15:46.608
AND A TROUBLES ME BECAUSE.

01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:48.343
WE THE LEGISLATURE HAVE NOT

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:49.711
WEIGHED IN SAID.

01:15:49.778 --> 01:15:51.947
IS IT OF VALUE.

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:52.547
TO CALIFORNIA'S HOLE IT JUST

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:53.815
SAYS THEM FLORA COMMISSION HAS

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:54.983
TOLD US.

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.919
AS WE APPROVED.

01:15:56.985 --> 01:15:59.988
PROP ONE A.

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:01.990
THAT THE THE THE SITES RESERVOIR

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.358
IN TEMPERATE SO WE HOLE

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:05.127
WHOLEHEARTEDLY WANTED. TO GET

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:08.397
FUNDED. IS NO VALUE TO THEM.

01:16:08.463 --> 01:16:08.964
THEREFORE OUR OPINION DIDN'T

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:14.136
MATTER.

01:16:14.202 --> 01:16:15.003
THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER AND AND

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:17.172
I. GOT UP AT MISTER GELLER NEXT

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:18.307
RIGHT BUT I WOULD JUST REITERATE

01:16:18.373 --> 01:16:18.941
THIS EMPLOYMENT I HEAR YOU ALL

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:20.676
SAYING WE DON'T WORK ON THIS FOR

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:21.777
YEARS AND I THINK.

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:23.011
PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE IT HAVE BEEN

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:24.880
SAYING FOR YEARS WHY YOU MYOPIC

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:26.448
ON ONE SOLUTION WHY AREN'T WE

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:27.516
LOOKING AT A MULTITUDE OF THANKS.

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:30.218
MISTER GALLAGHER.

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:32.821
SO FOR SOMEONE DID. YOU HELP ME

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:35.290
CAN UNDERSTAND THE THE FINANCIAL

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:37.426
INVESTMENT HERE BECAUSE.

01:16:37.492 --> 01:16:39.194
AS WAS SAID SEVENTEEN BILLION TO

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:41.863
BUILD WATER FIX ESSENTIALLY.

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:45.434
WHY NOT YOU KNOW ENSURE THAT WE

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:46.969
BUILD BOTH SITES RESERVOIR? AND

01:16:47.035 --> 01:16:49.137
TEMPERANCE FLAT.

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:51.540
TEMPERANCE FLAT WOULD STORE ONE

01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:52.708
POINT EIGHT MILLION THERE AT ONE

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:54.509
POINT EIGHT MILLION ACRE FEET OF

01:16:54.576 --> 01:16:55.644
WATER. THAT'S ALREADY SOUTH THE

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:57.879
DELTA.

01:16:57.946 --> 01:16:59.848
SO WE'VE ALREADY GOT IF IF WE

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:01.650
BUILT THAT PROJECT TODAY.

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:02.784
WE WOULD HAVE THAT WATER THAT

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:03.852
WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN AND MAYBE

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:05.087
THROUGH AN EAST WEST A

01:17:05.153 --> 01:17:06.755
CONNECTION CAN NOW.

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:08.156
COULD POTENTIALLY BE EXCHANGE

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:09.858
WATER THAT CAN BE USED FOR SOUTH

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:11.893
OF DELTA NEEDS.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.062
BUT THAT PROJECT NOW SITES DID

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:14.629
GET.

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:16.064
PUBLIC ELIGIBILITY FUNDING OF

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:18.133
THE WATER COMMISSION.

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.368
BUT TEMPERANCE GOD GROSSLY

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:20.202
UNDERFUNDED FOR ITS PUBLIC

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:22.070
BENEFITS.

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:24.239
AND.

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:26.241
SO THAT PROJECT LOOKS LIKE IT'S.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:28.243
VERY MUCH HAMSTRUNG.

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:30.112
AND FOR BASICALLY TWO POINT FIVE

01:17:30.178 --> 01:17:31.413
BILLION I THINK DOES THAT TOTAL

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.081
PROJECT COST.

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:35.283
VERSES SEVENTEEN BILLION.

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:36.885
THAT YOU CAN ONLY GET. I THINK

01:17:36.952 --> 01:17:38.353
BY WHAT YOU SAID FOR ANY

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:40.155
THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER.

01:17:40.222 --> 01:17:46.962
MAYBE DEPENDING

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:49.564
IN IN THE DELTA LATER THAT WE

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:51.767
HAVE AN ANTICIPATED.

01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:54.369
IS NOT A BETTER BET AND A MORE.

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:56.104
AT A BETTER USE OF OUR MONEY TO

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:58.540
GET MORE WATER SOUTH OF DELTA TO

01:17:58.607 --> 01:17:59.141
HELP WITH NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:00.842
STATE.

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:02.277
I I THINK IT'S APPLES AND

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:03.178
ORANGES.

01:18:03.245 --> 01:18:05.247
IN TERMS OF THE COMPARISONS HOA

01:18:05.313 --> 01:18:06.548
JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS TO

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:07.482
CONSIDER.

01:18:07.549 --> 01:18:09.851
ONE I AGREE WITH YOU THAT.

01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:12.454
STORAGE NEEDS TO PLAY A ROLE IN.

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:14.856
AND OUR WATER FUTURE IN THE

01:18:14.923 --> 01:18:16.591
WATER COMMISSION HAD ITS PROCESS

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:17.159
WHICH WAS.

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:20.195
.

01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:21.530
DETERMINE THROUGH THEIR

01:18:21.596 --> 01:18:21.830
REGULATORY.

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:23.598
.

01:18:23.665 --> 01:18:26.134
OF THE RULE MAKING ON HOW TO

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:28.703
DISPERSE THAT MONEY SO IF I

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:29.938
COULD WITH ALL DUE RESPECT KIND

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:30.605
OF SET THAT ASIDE AT THE MOMENT

01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:31.406
BUT.

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:33.642
BUT WATER FIX.

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:34.810
.

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:36.945
IS YOU KNOW EFFECTIVELY A

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:38.547
PROJECT THAT.

01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:40.048
WE BELIEVE WILL DO MULTIPLE

01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:41.383
THINGS THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:43.151
FOR WATER USERS AND FRANKLY ARE

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:44.820
A LYNCH PIN AND A LOT OF THESE

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:46.321
OTHER INVESTMENTS.

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:47.556
SO ONE.

01:18:47.622 --> 01:18:49.124
IT'S GOING TO PROTECT.

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:52.327
WATER SUPPLIES FROM AN OUTAGE.

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:53.595
TO TO.

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:55.564
EITHER A NATURAL DISASTER BE AN

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:57.732
EARTHQUAKE OR ANY.

01:18:57.799 --> 01:19:00.302
A BIG MOVING STORM THROUGH THE

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:02.270
SYSTEM TO ITS.

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:04.439
PROTECTS THOSE WATER SUPPLIES

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:04.806
FROM.

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:07.776
SEA LEVEL RISE OVER TIME AND IF

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:09.111
THERE'S ONE THING I THINK I'VE

01:19:09.177 --> 01:19:11.413
LEARNED IN THE PAST DECADE IS

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.348
THAT. THE INTENSITY OF THOSE

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:14.616
CONDITIONS ARE.

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:17.819
IS INCREASING AT A RATE OF WE

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.521
HADN'T REALLY PREDICTED.

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:22.157
BUT BUT HERE WE ARE.

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:23.358
.

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:25.527
FUNDAMENTALLY THE NEW INTAKES

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:28.130
CAN MOVE WATER IN A WAY THAT'S

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:31.166
MORE BENIGN ENVIRONMENTALLY THEN

01:19:31.233 --> 01:19:33.034
THE CURRENT. LEASE SITUATED

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:34.536
WATER PUMPS AND THAT'S SOMETHING

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.571
THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY KNOWN FOR

01:19:36.638 --> 01:19:36.805
DECADES.

01:19:36.872 --> 01:19:37.405
.

01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:39.374
BUT.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:40.976
WERE NOT ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY ACT

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:43.111
ON.

01:19:43.178 --> 01:19:44.679
THE VALUE OF THIS PROJECT I

01:19:44.746 --> 01:19:46.381
THINK IS MOST APPROPRIATELY

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:47.349
EXPRESSED.

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:49.518
.

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:51.019
AND ALL OF THOSE PUBLIC WATER

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:52.420
AGENCIES.

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:53.989
AND WITH THEIR BOARDS OF

01:19:54.055 --> 01:19:56.358
DIRECTORS THAT TAKE A LOOK AT

01:19:56.424 --> 01:19:58.126
THEIR SUPPLY THAT I THEY GET

01:19:58.193 --> 01:20:00.929
CONTRACTED THROUGH. OF MY

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:01.796
DEPARTMENT ATTITUDE OF YOU ARE

01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:03.598
IN THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:05.901
THEY PLAN FOR HOW THEY USE THAT

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.836
SUPPLY LOCALLY WITH OTHER

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:09.638
INVESTMENTS THAT THEY MAKE AND

01:20:09.704 --> 01:20:12.107
RECYCLED WATER. IN DESALINATION

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:14.109
IF IT'S AVAILABLE OBVIOUSLY

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:16.244
STORE THEIR CAPTURE IS OF A KIND

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:17.779
OF A NEW AREA WHERE WE'RE

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:19.881
STARTING TO FOCUS ON WE NOW HAVE

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:20.949
THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:22.284
MANAGEMENT ACT THAT'S GOING TO

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:24.419
REQUIRE US TO. GET OUR GROUND

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:26.955
WATER OF BASINS CLEAN AND I TO

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:30.792
HAVE A POINT OF SUSTAINABLE

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:31.860
YIELD A.

01:20:31.927 --> 01:20:32.594
OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.930
COUPLE OF DECADES SO. I'M MOST

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:36.031
OF WATER IN CALIFORNIA'S MANAGED

01:20:36.097 --> 01:20:39.167
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:20:39.234 --> 01:20:39.768
THE STATE WATER PROJECT IS A

01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:40.302
CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THAT

01:20:40.368 --> 01:20:42.170
SUPPLY AND IT'S THOSE PUBLIC

01:20:42.237 --> 01:20:43.805
WATER AGENCIES THAT NEED TO MAKE

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:45.607
A DETERMINATION BASED ON THEIR

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.542
LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES. OF THE

01:20:47.609 --> 01:20:50.345
VALUE OF OF THIS UPGRADE TO

01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:52.547
THEIR LOCAL RATEPAYERS AND

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:54.816
THAT'S WHY THE THE PAST NINE

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:56.251
MONTHS PLUS MONTHS HAVE BEEN

01:20:56.318 --> 01:20:58.887
CRITICAL IN. IN THE DISCUSSION

01:20:58.954 --> 01:20:59.888
BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S THE

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:01.456
DISCUSSION THAT'S HAPPENING IN

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:01.990
FRONT OF THESE BOARDS OF

01:21:02.057 --> 01:21:03.024
DIRECTORS AND.

01:21:03.091 --> 01:21:04.726
AND I BELIEVE THAT'S

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:06.661
WHERE IT THAT VALUE SHOULD

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:07.128
SHOULD LIE AND THAT'S

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:09.231
APPROPRIATE.

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:10.198
RIGHT IN THAT INCIDENT THAT'S A

01:21:10.265 --> 01:21:12.067
VERY LONG ANSWER A LOT IN THERE.

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:14.269
HOWEVER NONE OF THAT IS NOT OF

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:16.605
THAT SAYS THAT HAVING ONE POINT

01:21:16.671 --> 01:21:18.106
EIGHT MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER

01:21:18.173 --> 01:21:18.974
RD SOUTH ADULT THAT WOULD BE

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.177
HELPFUL FOR ALL THOSE THINGS

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:23.545
THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED. CHAIR

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:24.746
AND WAS SITES ONLINE WE WOULD BE

01:21:24.813 --> 01:21:25.981
ABLE TO SITES ONE OF THE

01:21:26.047 --> 01:21:27.849
BENEFITS OF SITES PROVIDING

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:28.783
FLOWS TO THE DELTA.

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:29.951
SO IF YOU HAD BOTH THOSE

01:21:30.018 --> 01:21:31.553
PROJECTS ONLINE IT WOULD DO THE

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.255
SAME THINGS HE DOES MENTION FOR

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:36.157
A FRACTION OF THE COST. AND.

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:37.759
I WOULD POINT OUT YOUR OFFICE

01:21:37.826 --> 01:21:39.027
DID PLAY A ROLE IN THE WATER

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:40.895
COMMISSION AS YOU WERE TO VALUE

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:43.198
RECREATIONAL BENEFITS. WHICH YOU

01:21:43.265 --> 01:21:45.600
GAVE ZERO TEMPERANCE FLAT.

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:46.468
AND YET YOUR OFFICE MOVED HEAVEN

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:48.470
AND EARTH.

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:51.139
TO MOVE THIS PROJECT FOR TO TO.

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:52.741
AND LET'S JUST BY ONE OF CLARIFY

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:53.608
THIS BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:54.943
ALMOST STATED LIKE WE WENT BACK

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:56.344
TO THE OTHER CONTRACTORS TO SEE

01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:58.446

LET'S BE REAL I MEAN I WOULD

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:04.085

TO LOBBY THESE GROUPS

01:22:08.556 --> 01:22:09.457
TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY

01:22:09.524 --> 01:22:10.091
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU JUST

01:22:10.158 --> 01:22:11.526
LET HIM GO BACK I THINK THERE

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:12.761
WAS A VERY CONCERTED IN

01:22:12.827 --> 01:22:14.829
AGGRESSIVE EFFORT.

01:22:14.896 --> 01:22:16.097
TO GET SANTA CLARA WATER

01:22:16.164 --> 01:22:18.266
DISTRICTS ONBOARD AND TO GET AT

01:22:18.333 --> 01:22:20.101
METROPOLITAN.

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:21.670

WE PROVIDE OF THE SAME

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.045
INFORMATION TO THEM THAT WE'VE

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:31.713
PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC ON THE

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.915
VALUE OF THIS PROJECT. ON THEY

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:35.383
DO THEIR OWN.

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:37.452
EVALUATIONS BASED ON THEIR

01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:39.854
URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS TO

01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:43.191
ESTABLISH A THE A APPROPRIATE

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:44.359
DEBATE FROM OTHER BOARD AS TO

01:22:44.426 --> 01:22:45.160
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S AN

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:46.661
INVESTMENT THAT'S APPROPRIATE

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:48.496
FOR THEIR RATE PAYERS. LEADING

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:51.032
LOBBY THEM TO TO COME ONBOARD TO

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:52.334
MAKE THIS PROJECT HAPPEN. THERE

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.002
WASN'T AN AGGRESSIVE EFFORT ON

01:22:54.069 --> 01:22:56.204
THE BEHALF ADMINISTRATION AND

01:22:56.271 --> 01:22:57.205
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:58.840
TO ENCOURAGE THE OTHER WATER

01:22:58.907 --> 01:22:59.507
CONTRACTORS TO COME ONBOARD WITH

01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:00.975
THIS PROJECT.

01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:02.977
I THINK THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:04.946
VERY ASSERTIVE FOR A DECADE ON

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:06.314
THE VALUE OF THIS PROJECT AND

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:08.283
THAT HASN'T CHANGED.

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:10.118
RIGHT AND LESS SO ON PROJECTS

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:11.619
LIKE TEMPERANCE FLAT WHICH ARE

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:13.388
ALSO IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THE

01:23:13.455 --> 01:23:14.022
WATER FOR.

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:16.491
SOUTH OF DELTA CONCERNS IN FACT

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:18.259
WHEN YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO

01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:19.994
SHUT HIM DOWN AND SAID ZERO ZERO

01:23:20.061 --> 01:23:21.763
POINTS THERE.

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:23.465
WELL WE DID A JUST THROUGH THE

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:25.200
APPEALS PROCESS OF THE

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:26.267
RECREATION BENEFIT ASSOCIATED

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:28.470
WITH TEMPERANCE FLAT.

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:29.771
RIGHT AND THEN SO LAST QUESTION

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:31.239
IS.

01:23:31.306 --> 01:23:31.940
YOU KNOW YOU SAID IN YOUR

01:23:32.006 --> 01:23:33.742
PRESENTATION THAT YOU ANTICIPATE

01:23:33.808 --> 01:23:34.376
THE CENTRAL VALLEY WILL COME

01:23:34.442 --> 01:23:35.310
ONBOARD RIGHT WHAT DO YOU MEAN

01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:36.811
BY THAT.

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:40.215
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE.

01:23:40.281 --> 01:23:41.883
NOT ANTICIPATE YOU CAN HOPE TO

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.685
FORCE OR COERCE THEM TO COME IN

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:44.586
BECAUSE HE SHUT DOWN THEIR

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:47.389
BIGGEST PROJECT TEMPERANCE FLAT.

01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:48.623
THEY WERE PROVIDE WATER FOR THE

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:51.459
CENTRAL VALLEY. AND NOW HAVE NO

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:52.494
TEN BILLION TO MAKE SURE IT'S

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.396
TWO TUNNELS BUT THE IDEAS

01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:56.731
ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE. A GUYS

01:23:56.798 --> 01:23:57.532
WANNA COME IN THIS PROJECT YOU

01:23:57.599 --> 01:24:00.101
CAN BUT YOU'RE GONNA PASS TO GET

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:01.469
IN TO GET IT RIGHT.

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:03.304
I MEAN ISN'T IS NOT SORT OF

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:05.106
WHAT'S GOING ON AND. WITH THE

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:06.241
CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S NOT WHAT WE

01:24:06.307 --> 01:24:07.475
ANTICIPATE WE'RE GONNA TRY AND

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:09.577
FORCE THEM.

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:10.378
TO COME INTO THE PROJECT IS THAT

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:12.013
RIGHT. I DON'T BELIEVE SO THIS

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.515
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A A PROJECT

01:24:13.581 --> 01:24:15.517
BASED ON WILLING PARTICIPANTS

01:24:15.583 --> 01:24:16.818
AND MANY OF THOSE CONTRACTORS

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:18.019
ACTUALLY WERE ACTIVE

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:19.521
PARTICIPANTS AND PAID FOR THE

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:20.822
PLANNING PROCESS.

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:23.024
I THINK THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS.

01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:24.726
UNIQUE TO THE US BUREAU OF

01:24:24.793 --> 01:24:25.960
RECLAMATION.

01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:27.896
AND I'M HAVING A LOT OF

01:24:27.962 --> 01:24:28.897
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

01:24:28.963 --> 01:24:30.498
RECLAMATION COMMISSIONER TO

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:32.567
IDENTIFY A PATH.

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:34.335
WHEREBY A CENTRAL VALLEY

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:36.704
PROJECT CONTRACTORS WHO WOULD I

01:24:36.771 --> 01:24:38.239

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:40.875
TUNNELS HAVE THEY HAVE A PATH TO

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:45.747

MONTHS THAT METROPOLITAN WATER

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:02.630
DECIDED TO DOUBLE THE AMOUNT

01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:03.097
THEY WERE PUTTING IN.

01:25:03.164 --> 01:25:03.932

VERY QUICKLY SO THAT I MEAN THAT

BETTER BE A TIME A PLACE TO REAP

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:50.812
FOR PRESS TO HOLD.

WE ASK FOR A MODEL.

01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:04.692

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:43.831
GOT ZERO.

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:46.234
FOR RECREATION.

01:26:46.301 --> 01:26:48.369
AT ZERO.

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:50.071
FOR INCREASED FLOWS AND AND A

01:26:50.138 --> 01:26:52.240
NET BENEFIT.

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:52.874
DOWNSTREAM TO THE TO THE. FISH

01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:54.809
HABITATS.

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:55.910
USING.

01:26:55.977 --> 01:26:58.146
A.

01:26:58.212 --> 01:26:59.914
A WELL REGARDED.

01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:03.017
ACCEPTED MODEL.

01:27:03.084 --> 01:27:04.519
THAT WE WERE TOLD I WASN'T

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:06.521
HEARING THREE AND HALF HOURS.

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:08.623
THAT WAS APPROPRIATE TO USE

01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:10.692
AND WE DID.

01:27:10.758 --> 01:27:13.895
AND IT WAS THAT THE

01:27:13.962 --> 01:27:15.029
TESTIMONY OF THE STAFF THAT

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:16.130
ASTOUNDED US THAT THEY BASICALLY

01:27:16.197 --> 01:27:17.398
SAID THAT ENTIRE MODEL WE'RE

01:27:17.465 --> 01:27:19.133
GOING TO THROW OUT WE DON'T.

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.636
BELIEVE IT'S WORTH IT.

01:27:21.703 --> 01:27:23.304
AND WE HAVE ASKED ALL ALONG

01:27:23.371 --> 01:27:25.940
WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE MODEL.

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:27.575
GIVE US A AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE

01:27:27.642 --> 01:27:31.145
ANSWER WAS WE DON'T HAVE ONE.

01:27:31.212 --> 01:27:32.914
WE WERE NOT PROVIDED ANY

01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:34.616
OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE THE.

01:27:34.682 --> 01:27:36.484
THE VALUE.

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:37.819
WE THINK THERE IS A CONNECTION

01:27:37.885 --> 01:27:40.121
BETWEEN WESTLANDS DENIAL.

01:27:40.188 --> 01:27:42.957
OF PARTICIPATION.

01:27:43.024 --> 01:27:44.759
AND OUR DENIAL OF TEMPERANCE.

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:46.127
AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS

01:27:46.194 --> 01:27:49.797
BORDERING ON ON ON OF ON A VERY.

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:51.766
ALMOST DICTATORIAL APPROACH

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:52.767
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IF YOU

01:27:52.834 --> 01:27:53.768
PLAY BALL WITH THE BROWN

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:56.004
ADMINISTRATION YOU GET THE DEAL

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:57.739
AND IF YOU DON'T.

01:27:57.805 --> 01:27:59.507
BUT YOU YOU GET MESSED WITH

01:27:59.574 --> 01:28:02.343
AND AND TO ME THIS THIS IS I

01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:03.711
MEAN IT'S NOT COINCIDENTAL THAT

01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:08.282
SANTA CLARA. HELD OFF.

01:28:08.349 --> 01:28:10.318
THEY DID THE BOOK PERSONAL DEBT

01:28:10.385 --> 01:28:12.153
DEBT VOTED NOT TO PARTICIPATE.

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:12.987
THEN THEY THEN THEY HOOK HOLD

01:28:13.054 --> 01:28:14.088
OFF

01:28:14.155 --> 01:28:15.490
JAYCO GETS APPROVED.

01:28:15.556 --> 01:28:17.959
AND A FEW DAYS LATER A THEY SAY

01:28:18.026 --> 01:28:18.559
HEY HERE'S A WHOLE WHOLE BUNCH

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:18.860
MORE MONEY.

01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:19.494
IF YOU PLAY BALL WITH THE BROWN

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.829
ADMINISTRATION.

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:24.365
YOU GET THE DEAL.

01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:26.801
AND YOU GET THE WATER.

01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:28.403
AND I'M AYE I THINK THERE IS

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:29.904
SOMETHING.

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:31.673
TERRIBLY AMISS HERE.

01:28:31.739 --> 01:28:32.940
AND I THINK YOU'RE HEARING THAT

01:28:33.007 --> 01:28:33.541
FROM THESE MEMBERS

01:28:33.608 --> 01:28:35.376
WHO.

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:37.045
WENT TO THE BARRICADES OVER PROP

01:28:37.111 --> 01:28:39.180
ONE.

01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:41.049
WE WORKED OUR AND AND WE AND AND.

01:28:41.115 --> 01:28:43.051
WE

01:28:43.117 --> 01:28:45.486
WERE ASSURED.

01:28:45.553 --> 01:28:47.789
THAT THERE WOULD BE FAIR.

01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:49.457
A OPPORTUNITY FOR TEMPERANCE AND

01:28:49.524 --> 01:28:51.025
FOR.

01:28:51.092 --> 01:28:51.859
S. SITES IN FOR THESE.

01:28:51.926 --> 01:28:54.295
OTHERS.

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:55.563
AND WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN SHOT

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:58.466
DOWN AT EVERY TURN.

01:28:58.533 --> 01:29:00.101
AND THEN WE TURN AROUND AND SEE

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:01.569
BUT JACO APPROVED AND

01:29:01.636 --> 01:29:02.937

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:03.938
CLARA PROVES.

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:06.574
WHY?

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:08.176
SHOULD WE NOT BE SUSPICIOUS OF

01:29:08.242 --> 01:29:10.244
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

01:29:10.311 --> 01:29:11.813
AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:29:11.879 --> 01:29:14.115
ATTEMPTING TO DO WHEN IT SEEMS

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:17.251
LIKE THE REAL EVIDENCE.

01:29:17.318 --> 01:29:19.587

THIS ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE SEE

01:29:28.162 --> 01:29:29.564

INCREASE STORAGE AND AN

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:39.040
INCREASED WATER FLOWS.

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:44.011
WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU?

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:47.715

JUST WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON

01:30:06.267 --> 01:30:08.936
HERE. BECAUSE WE DON'T SEE TRUST

01:30:09.003 --> 01:30:11.506

HONESTLY RIGHT BACK I THINK THAT

CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSIONS.

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:23.751
PROCESS I THINK IT SPEAKS FOR

01:30:23.818 --> 01:30:25.253
ITSELF IN TERMS OF THE

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:27.822
REGULATIONS THEY PROMULGATED AND.

01:30:27.889 --> 01:30:29.123
IN TERMS OF HOW THEY WERE GOING

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:29.757
TO.

01:30:29.824 --> 01:30:31.225
VALUE.

01:30:31.292 --> 01:30:34.695
THE PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIO AND.

01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:37.498
MANY PROJECTS ORIGINALLY.

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:40.101
HAD A ZERO MARK AND THROUGH AN

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:41.002
APPEALS PROCESS.

01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:43.171
THAT WAS CONDUCTED IN A

01:30:43.237 --> 01:30:44.672
TRANSPARENT WAY THEY WERE ABLE

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:45.640
TO.

01:30:45.706 --> 01:30:47.975
THEY WERE ABLE TO RAISE THEIR

01:30:48.042 --> 01:30:49.644
PUBLIC BENEFIT RATIO.

01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:51.779
I'M NOT PREPARED TO GET INTO

01:30:51.846 --> 01:30:54.215
THE DETAILS TODAY ON THE

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:56.184
RECREATION BENEFITS A TEMPERANCE

01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:57.251
FLAT I'D BE.

01:30:57.318 --> 01:30:59.253
I I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:30:59.320 --> 01:30:59.921
TO DO THAT.

01:30:59.987 --> 01:31:01.889
WHEN I'M MORE PREPARED ON THAT

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:04.625
VERY SPECIFIC TOPIC AND I WOULD

01:31:04.692 --> 01:31:06.627
WELCOME THAT DISCUSSION WITH YOU.

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:08.529

UP ON THAT AND WOULD AND AND I

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:11.265
THINK THERE ARE OTHER MEMBERS.

01:31:11.332 --> 01:31:13.601
PARTICULARLY OF UP OF THE

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:14.902
CENTRAL CALIFORNIA CAUCUS STATED

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:16.838
THAT INTENDED TO DO THAT THAT

01:31:16.904 --> 01:31:18.239
VERY THING BUT I WANT TO

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:19.941
REITERATE.

01:31:20.007 --> 01:31:21.909
FACTS ARE THE FACTS

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:24.145
THAT THE MODEL WE USED WAS

01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:26.948
APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION UPON

01:31:27.014 --> 01:31:28.616
A REQUEST OF EIGHT AND APPROVED

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:30.451
MODEL.

01:31:30.518 --> 01:31:32.987
WHEN WE DID ALL OF THE WORK.

01:31:33.054 --> 01:31:34.455
THE TESTIMONY WAS THAT THE MODEL

01:31:34.522 --> 01:31:36.357
DOESN'T.

01:31:36.424 --> 01:31:37.792
THERE IS NO GOOD ANYMORE IT'S

01:31:37.859 --> 01:31:40.528
OUTDATED AND WE SAID WHAT'S THE

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:42.330
ADDITION WHAT WHAT.

01:31:42.396 --> 01:31:43.698
WHAT'S AN ATTORNEY THAT AND THAT

01:31:43.764 --> 01:31:45.533
A DIFFERENT MODEL.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.168
THAT WE CAN APPROPRIATE WOULD WE

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:48.469
WE WERE NOT GIVEN ANY

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:50.905
OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:52.607
TEMPERANCE FLAT COULD DO BECAUSE

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:54.208
THE VERY MODEL WAS STRIPPED FROM

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:56.777
US AND NO ADDITIONAL DIFFERENT

01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:59.046
MODEL. WAS SUGGESTED IN FACT IN

01:31:59.113 --> 01:32:01.048
TESTIMONY THEY STATE WE HAVE NOT.

01:32:01.115 --> 01:32:03.284
HOW IS IT THAT DUE PROCESS HOW

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:05.219
IS THAT FAIR AND HOW IN THE

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:06.787
WORLD DOES THAT COMPORT WITH

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:08.356
WHAT YOU JUST?

01:32:08.422 --> 01:32:09.957
TESTIFIED THAT THE WATER

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:11.926
COMMISSION USED IT REGULATORY.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.762
DETERMINATIONS AND IT AND I AND

01:32:14.829 --> 01:32:16.597
ALL OF THAT. TO BASICALLY SAY

01:32:16.664 --> 01:32:17.965
THERE IS NO PATH FOR TEMPERANCE

01:32:18.032 --> 01:32:19.533
BLACK.

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:20.368
BECAUSE THERE'S NO MODEL THAT'S

01:32:20.434 --> 01:32:21.903
GOING TO WORK

01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:23.137
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ONE.

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:25.072
I CAN ONLY REITERATE MY OFFER.

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:26.540
TO HAVE A MUCH MORE DETAILED

01:32:26.607 --> 01:32:28.075
CONVERSATION WITH YOU ON THIS

01:32:28.142 --> 01:32:29.944
TOPIC WHEN I HAVE BETTER

01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:31.012
INFORMATION A LOT WHEN I'M

01:32:31.078 --> 01:32:32.513
UNDERSTAND THAT I APPRECIATED

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:34.382
AND AND THAT AT SOME POINT I I

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:36.050
DO. I DO THINK.

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:36.684
AND I'M ASKING OTHER COLLEAGUES

01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:38.019

PERHAPS TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE.

01:32:42.456 --> 01:32:44.959
ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:46.661

01:32:46.727 --> 01:32:48.429
HEARINGS INTO THE PRECISE.

01:32:48.496 --> 01:32:50.031
PROCESS BY WHICH TEMPERANCE FLAT

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:51.432
WAS DENIED BECAUSE WE BELIEVE

01:32:51.499 --> 01:32:54.135
THAT DOES HUGE DAMAGE TO THE

01:32:54.201 --> 01:32:56.504
PROMISES OF THE PROPOSITION.

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:58.806

01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:31.772
THIS TWIN TOTAL PLAN.

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:33.708
BUT IN MY DISTRICT.

01:33:33.774 --> 01:33:34.809
AND THE DUTCH SLEW.

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:37.311
OF.

01:33:37.378 --> 01:33:39.947
WHAT'S A WATER.

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:41.582
YOU MEDIA. WHEN WAS RESTORATION.

01:33:41.649 --> 01:33:42.717
WHICH WASN'T TITLED IN TWO

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:43.818
THOUSAND TWO WERE BREAKING

01:33:43.884 --> 01:33:45.086
GROUND THIS MONTH AND SIXTEEN

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:46.721
YEARS LATER.

01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:48.422
FOR WETLANDS RESTORATION.

01:33:48.489 --> 01:33:49.824
SIMPLE PROJECT.

01:33:49.890 --> 01:33:52.927
OKAY.

01:33:52.994 --> 01:33:54.395
GOOD GOOD MAKE THE DELTA BETTER.

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:56.464
BUT.

01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:58.866
YOU KNOW ALL THE SUDDEN.

01:33:58.933 --> 01:34:01.268
MISSING FUNNELS DOWN FUNNELS

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:02.570
DOWNFALLS IN ALL IT'S NOW IT'S

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:04.505
ON A PATH.

01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:06.374
I THINK WE NEED TO SLOW THIS

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:07.475
THING DOWN EARLY'S ENJOYMENT AND

01:34:07.541 --> 01:34:07.842
MAKE SURE THAT.

01:34:07.908 --> 01:34:08.743
.

01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:09.744
WE'RE NOT STUCK HOLDING THE BAG

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:10.344
ON THIS THING BECAUSE.

01:34:10.411 --> 01:34:10.478
.

01:34:10.544 --> 01:34:13.114
AGAIN.

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.382
WE HAVE NO ASSURANCES THAT IT'S

01:34:14.448 --> 01:34:15.516
NOT GOING TO GO UP INTO THE THAT

01:34:15.583 --> 01:34:17.818
HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF.

01:34:17.885 --> 01:34:20.654
AND AND IF IT DOES.

01:34:20.721 --> 01:34:21.155
THE USER SAY SO BE IT.

01:34:21.222 --> 01:34:23.991
SO.

01:34:24.058 --> 01:34:25.259
SPIKE TO SENSE.

01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:26.794
WE DO KNOW THAT THE PLANNING.

01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:28.295
DOUBLE THE COST

01:34:28.362 --> 01:34:30.064
A PLAN FOR THIS PROJECT.

01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:32.033
DOUBLING COST FROM WHAT THEY

01:34:32.099 --> 01:34:33.134
THOUGHT SO AND THAT I THINK THAT

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.802
GIVES AN INDICATION OF. A THE

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:37.605
COMPLEXITIES OF MR MATHIS AND

01:34:37.671 --> 01:34:38.906
THEN MISTER SALAS AND THEN AND.

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:39.774
NOW I THINK WE'VE HEARD A LOT

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.476
ABOUT ABOUT TEMPERATURE MOVE WE

01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:43.978
SO SAW ECHO ALL THE TEMPERANCE

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:44.245
REMARKS.

01:34:44.311 --> 01:34:47.181
THEN A ANY GETS A A GREAT POINT

01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:49.350
ABOUT THAT THE COST OF PROJECTS

01:34:49.417 --> 01:34:50.818

01:35:03.998 --> 01:35:06.367
REGULATORY DEMONSTRATIONS.

01:35:06.434 --> 01:35:10.438
WORDS LIKE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

01:35:10.504 --> 01:35:10.905
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:12.706

01:35:52.179 --> 01:35:54.115
PEOPLE OF THIS STATE.

01:35:54.181 --> 01:35:55.850
WE DON'T NEED TO BE USING.

01:35:55.916 --> 01:35:58.853

FARTHER TO HAMMER ON ON THE

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:23.844
IMPORTANCE OF TEMPERANCE AND.

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:24.445
TAKE TO GET INTO THINGS LIKE

01:36:24.512 --> 01:36:27.448
DESALINATED THINGS FOR SOUTHERN

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:29.283
CALIFORNIA.

01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:31.485
BUT WE HAVE AN EXTREME PROBLEM

01:36:31.552 --> 01:36:33.821
WITH THE DELTA WE WERE PROBLEM

01:36:33.888 --> 01:36:34.355

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:56.610
CONCERN IS I LOOK FORWARD TO THE

01:36:56.677 --> 01:36:58.612

TEMPERANCE FLATS AND LOW.

01:37:22.102 --> 01:37:23.437
THEN THE WATER COMMISSION.

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:26.373

LEGISLATORS HERE THAT ARE FILL

01:37:27.074 --> 01:37:27.374

THE WATER WHOLESALER OF SOUTHERN

01:41:36.023 --> 01:41:37.357
CALIFORNIA.

01:41:37.424 --> 01:41:38.826
WE PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE THAN

01:41:38.892 --> 01:41:40.360
HALF OF ALL THE WATER USED IN

01:41:40.427 --> 01:41:41.929

THIS SIX COUNTY SERVICE AREA HAS

01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:54.441
NINETEEN MILLION PEOPLE ON IT

01:41:54.508 --> 01:41:56.577
AFFECTIVELY WE SERVE WATER TO

01:41:56.643 --> 01:41:58.378
THROUGH OUR MEMBER AGENCIES TO

01:41:58.445 --> 01:42:00.080
ONE IN EVERY TWO CALIFORNIANS.

01:42:00.147 --> 01:42:01.715
ANDA ROUGHLY THAT'S ONE EVERY

01:42:01.782 --> 01:42:03.450
SIXTEEN AMERICANS IN SOUTHERN

01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:04.852
CALIFORNIA THERE SIGNIFICANT

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:06.453
ECONOMY ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.788
THE STATE'S ECONOMY ALSO RESIDES

01:42:07.855 --> 01:42:09.189
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LIKE IT'S

01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:10.390
THEIR WATER. UP THROUGH

01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:12.192
METROPOLITAN.

01:42:12.259 --> 01:42:13.460
THE WATER THAT MUCH FUN PROVIDES

01:42:13.527 --> 01:42:15.429
COMES FROM TWO PLACES PRIMARILY

01:42:15.496 --> 01:42:16.663
ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL OF

01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:18.265
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS IMPORTED

01:42:18.332 --> 01:42:19.600
FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THROUGH

01:42:19.666 --> 01:42:21.235
THE STATE WATER PROJECT. AND

01:42:21.301 --> 01:42:22.202
THEN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT

01:42:22.269 --> 01:42:24.104
METROPOLITAN IMPORTS THROUGH ITS

01:42:24.171 --> 01:42:25.706
COLORADO RIVER ACT WITH ACT UP

01:42:25.772 --> 01:42:27.708
BRINGING IT IN. AND YOU SERVING

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:29.109
THOSE TWO SUPPLIES BLENDING THEM

01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:30.277
AND DELIVERING THEM THROUGHOUT

01:42:30.344 --> 01:42:31.778
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:42:31.845 --> 01:42:33.347
THE OTHER FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF

01:42:33.413 --> 01:42:34.648
WATER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:36.250
THERE'S A SMALL PIECE THAT COMES

01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:37.985
THAT IS JUST THE CITY OF LA IS

01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:38.852
THAT IS IMPORTED FROM THE OWENS

01:42:38.919 --> 01:42:39.386
VALLEY.

01:42:39.453 --> 01:42:40.921
ROUGHLY FIVE TO TEN PERCENT OF

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:42.789
THE REGION'S WATER AND THE REST

01:42:42.856 --> 01:42:45.425
IS OUR LOCAL NATIVE WATER

01:42:45.492 --> 01:42:46.093
THROUGH OUR GROUND WATER BASINS

01:42:46.159 --> 01:42:46.894
AND OURS RELATIVELY SMALL

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:49.763
AMOUNTS OF RAINFALL.

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:52.299
OUR BOARD A DECIDED TO INVEST IN

01:42:52.366 --> 01:42:52.933
WATER FIX.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.801
THIS LAST APRIL.

01:42:54.868 --> 01:42:56.570
WE ACTUALLY HAD THE CITED IT

01:42:56.637 --> 01:42:58.105
PREVIOUSLY TO DO IT IN OCTOBER

01:42:58.171 --> 01:43:00.240
AD THAT WAS A DIFFERENT FORMAT

01:43:00.307 --> 01:43:02.042
BECAUSE WE WERE LOOKING AT A CBP

01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:03.810
PORTION OF IT ROUGHLY A THIRD OF

01:43:03.877 --> 01:43:04.845
THIS PROJECT WOULD BEEN FINANCED

01:43:04.912 --> 01:43:06.179
BY CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT

01:43:06.246 --> 01:43:07.080
CONTRACTORS.

01:43:07.147 --> 01:43:09.016
THEN WE TOOK IT MATTER UP AGAIN

01:43:09.082 --> 01:43:10.384
WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THEY WOULD

01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:12.586
NOT PARTICIPATE IN APRIL. AND

01:43:12.653 --> 01:43:14.154
OUR BOARD LOOKED AT TWO OPTIONS

01:43:14.221 --> 01:43:15.956
ONE IS BUILDING HELPING THE

01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:18.292
STATE FINANCE A SMALLER OPTION A

01:43:18.358 --> 01:43:20.527
ONE TUNNEL TO WHEN TAKE OPTION.

01:43:20.594 --> 01:43:22.629
THE OR FINANCE THE ENTIRE

01:43:22.696 --> 01:43:24.131
PROJECT WHERE WE WOULD PICK UP

01:43:24.197 --> 01:43:26.867
THAT CENTRAL VALLEY PORTION AND

01:43:26.934 --> 01:43:27.968
USE. TO SEE A THAT DOESN'T

01:43:28.035 --> 01:43:29.436
INVESTMENT.

01:43:29.503 --> 01:43:31.505
I WE LOOKED AT IT OUR BOARD

01:43:31.572 --> 01:43:32.339
LOOKED AT IT FROM ABOUT FIVE

01:43:32.406 --> 01:43:32.873
MAIN ISSUES OF THAT WERE

01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:34.174
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO US. ONE

01:43:34.241 --> 01:43:35.876
THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THOUGH IS

01:43:35.943 --> 01:43:37.544
THE WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY THE

01:43:37.611 --> 01:43:39.012
PROJECT PROVIDED.

01:43:39.079 --> 01:43:41.081
WE ARE HAVE BEEN LOSING WATER

01:43:41.148 --> 01:43:42.316
SUPPLY FROM STATE WATER PROJECT

01:43:42.382 --> 01:43:43.550
IT'S THIRTY PERCENT OF SOUTHERN

01:43:43.617 --> 01:43:45.118
CALIFORNIA SUPPLY.

01:43:45.185 --> 01:43:46.486
THE PROJECT HAS ROUGHLY LOST

01:43:46.553 --> 01:43:47.621
ABOUT A THIRD OF ITS RELIABILITY

01:43:47.688 --> 01:43:49.022
TO TWO ENDANGERED SPECIES

01:43:49.089 --> 01:43:50.123
S. CUTBACKS OVER THE LAST COUPLE

01:43:50.190 --> 01:43:51.625
OF DECADES.

01:43:51.692 --> 01:43:53.160
THIS PROJECT HELPS REVERSE THAT

01:43:53.226 --> 01:43:54.995
IT HELPS TURN THAT AROUND.

01:43:55.062 --> 01:43:56.830
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT A CLIMATE

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:57.731
CHANGE WORLD WERE IN A CLIMATE

01:43:57.798 --> 01:43:59.633
CHANGE WORLD OF RAIN AND LESS

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:01.802
SNOW WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF

01:44:01.868 --> 01:44:04.438
WAITING FOR THE SNOW TO MELT AND

01:44:04.504 --> 01:44:05.038
PICK UP AND PUMP YEAR ROUND

01:44:05.105 --> 01:44:06.173
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PICK UP

01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:08.308
WATER. IN SHORT BURSTS AND MOVE

01:44:08.375 --> 01:44:10.077
IT INTO STORAGE AND MOVE THAT

01:44:10.143 --> 01:44:11.345
INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:44:11.411 --> 01:44:12.779
SO WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE WATER

01:44:12.846 --> 01:44:14.181
SUPPLY RELIABILITY ENDANGERED

01:44:14.247 --> 01:44:15.682
SPECIES IMPACTS

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:18.051
A CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS.

01:44:18.118 --> 01:44:19.686
AND THEN FINALLY WATER QUALITY

01:44:19.753 --> 01:44:20.787
HUGELY IMPORTANT TO SOUTHERN

01:44:20.854 --> 01:44:22.189
CALIFORNIA OUR GROUND WATER

01:44:22.255 --> 01:44:24.157
BASINS NEED THAT FRESH WATER OF

01:44:24.224 --> 01:44:25.592
STATE WATER PROJECT. ARE

01:44:25.659 --> 01:44:27.060
COLORADO RIVER WATER IS

01:44:27.127 --> 01:44:29.129
SIGNIFICANTLY SALTIER THAT'S WHY

01:44:29.196 --> 01:44:30.364
WE BLEND THE TWO AND WE CAN USE

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:31.765
IT FOR BOTH OUR RECYCLING

01:44:31.832 --> 01:44:33.200
PROGRAMS ARE CONSERVATION

01:44:33.266 --> 01:44:34.735
PROGRAMS AND PUTTING THAT WATER

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:37.104
INTO OUR GROUND WATER BASINS.

01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:38.138
AND THEN FINALLY THE GOVERNOR

01:44:38.205 --> 01:44:40.007
STRESSED WITH US.

01:44:40.073 --> 01:44:41.875
ATTENTION THE LAY UP WE WERE

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:43.310
LOOKING AT A WE'VE WORKED ON

01:44:43.377 --> 01:44:45.078
THIS PROJECT FOR A DECADE WE

01:44:45.145 --> 01:44:46.413
HAVE INVESTED TWO HUNDRED AND

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:47.347
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:44:47.414 --> 01:44:49.449
COLLECTIVELY AS WATER. MANAGERS

01:44:49.516 --> 01:44:51.518
TO STUDY THIS PROJECT AND COME

01:44:51.585 --> 01:44:53.553
UP WITH THE PROPOSED PROJECT.

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:55.455
AFTER A DECADE OF ANALYSIS.

01:44:55.522 --> 01:44:57.324
MOVING TO A ONE TUNNEL INSTEAD

01:44:57.391 --> 01:44:58.625
OF TWO TUNNELS MOVING TO A

01:44:58.692 --> 01:45:00.293
PARTIAL SOLUTION INSTEAD OF A

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:02.629
FULL SOLUTION. UP POTENTIALLY

01:45:02.696 --> 01:45:03.897
WOULD HAVE GONE BACK TO THE

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:05.799
DRAWING BOARD MORE REVIEW MORE

01:45:05.866 --> 01:45:07.734
ANALYSIS MORE STUDY.

01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:09.202
BUT MY BOARD WAS FED UP WITH

01:45:09.269 --> 01:45:11.104
DELAY FED UP WITH THIS DECADE WE

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:12.272
SPENT WORKING ON THIS AND THEY

01:45:12.339 --> 01:45:13.774
WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD.

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.275
SO CONSIDERING ALL THAT THEY

01:45:15.342 --> 01:45:17.511
DECIDED TO MOVE FORWARD.

01:45:17.577 --> 01:45:19.246
NOW DOES HAVE WE LOOKED AT VERY

01:45:19.312 --> 01:45:20.047
CAREFULLY AT THE FINANCIAL

01:45:20.113 --> 01:45:21.515
IMPACTS OF THAT.

01:45:21.581 --> 01:45:24.484
THE PROJECT COST METROPOLITAN.

01:45:24.551 --> 01:45:26.553
ABOUT FOUR DOLLARS AND EIGHTY

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:27.554
CENTS PER HOUSEHOLD IN SOUTHERN

01:45:27.621 --> 01:45:29.022
CALIFORNIA.

01:45:29.089 --> 01:45:31.158
THAT'S WHAT THE FULL TEN POINT

01:45:31.224 --> 01:45:32.159
EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR FINANCING

01:45:32.225 --> 01:45:34.027
LEVEL. IF WE DID JUST OUR SHARE

01:45:34.094 --> 01:45:35.729
OF IT IT WAS TWO DOLLARS AND

01:45:35.796 --> 01:45:36.830
FORTY CENTS PER HOUSEHOLD IN

01:45:36.897 --> 01:45:38.999
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA A MONTH.

01:45:39.066 --> 01:45:40.133
THAT'S AFTER THE FULL BUILD OUT

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.135
ITSELF BLARED IN OVER A DECADE

01:45:42.202 --> 01:45:44.037
SO IT GOES AND IT ROUGHLY. ABOUT

01:45:44.104 --> 01:45:45.372
TWENTY FIVE CENTS A MONTH FIFTY

01:45:45.439 --> 01:45:46.940
CENTS A MONTH AND THEN THAT

01:45:47.007 --> 01:45:47.974
BUILDS UP TO THAT AMOUNT.

01:45:48.041 --> 01:45:49.810
THAT WAS LOOKED AT IS THAT

01:45:49.876 --> 01:45:51.645
AFFORDABLE FOR OUR REGION WE DO

01:45:51.712 --> 01:45:53.580
SPREAD ACROSS A BIG BASS OVER

01:45:53.647 --> 01:45:54.681
SIX MILLION HOUSEHOLDS NINETEEN

01:45:54.748 --> 01:45:56.783
MILLION PEOPLE. THAT FIVE

01:45:56.850 --> 01:45:57.384
DOLLARS A MONTH WHEN WE LOOKED

01:45:57.451 --> 01:45:58.919
AT.

01:45:58.985 --> 01:45:59.786
ADDING IT AGAINST THE CELL

01:45:59.853 --> 01:46:01.288
ADDING AGAINST DISTRIBUTIVE

01:46:01.354 --> 01:46:02.689
STORM WATER CAPTURE

01:46:02.756 --> 01:46:04.991
SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER THAN THOSE.

01:46:05.058 --> 01:46:06.193
IT DOESN'T DISPLACE THOSE WE'RE

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:06.993
GONNA HAVE TO DO ALL OF THE

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:08.495
ABOVE WERE VERY PROUD OF OUR

01:46:08.562 --> 01:46:10.363
TRACK RECORD IN NINETEEN NINETY

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:11.965
WE SERVED FOURTEEN MILLION

01:46:12.032 --> 01:46:14.334
PEOPLE. WITH AND MUCH PALM SOLD

01:46:14.401 --> 01:46:16.069
TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ACRE FEET.

01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:17.571
TODAY WE SERVE NINETEEN MILLION

01:46:17.637 --> 01:46:18.772
PEOPLE AND WE'RE GONNA SELL ONE

01:46:18.839 --> 01:46:20.674
POINT SEVEN MILLION ACRE FEET.

01:46:20.741 --> 01:46:22.075
WE'VE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR

01:46:22.142 --> 01:46:23.944
RELIANCE ON IMPORTED WATER WATER

01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:25.979
FROM THE DELTA. BUT IT'S NOT

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:27.547
GOING TO BE REPLACED OVERNIGHT

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:29.316
UP A DIESEL PLANTS.

01:46:29.382 --> 01:46:30.584
WOULD BE BETWEEN LA AND SAN

01:46:30.650 --> 01:46:32.085
DIEGO TO REPLACE OUR STATE WATER

01:46:32.152 --> 01:46:34.087
PROJECT WATER WOULD BE A DIESEL

01:46:34.154 --> 01:46:36.123
PLANT EVERY THREE MILES IT WOULD

01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:37.891
TAKE FIFTY DIESEL PLANTS OVER

01:46:37.958 --> 01:46:39.392
FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS TO DO THAT

01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:41.094
WITH THE CELL ON. THERE SIMPLY

01:46:41.161 --> 01:46:43.430
ISN'T THE ABILITY TO REPLACE

01:46:43.497 --> 01:46:44.197
THIRTY PERCENT OF YOUR WATER

01:46:44.264 --> 01:46:46.967
SUPPLY IN A GENERATION WITH

01:46:47.033 --> 01:46:47.567
THOSE OTHER TOOLS THAT WE HAVE

01:46:47.634 --> 01:46:48.635
TODAY.

01:46:48.702 --> 01:46:50.771
SO ALL THAT OUR BOARD IS LOOKING

01:46:50.837 --> 01:46:53.039
FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO INVEST.

01:46:53.106 --> 01:46:54.574
WHEN WE PASSED OUR APRIL BOARD

01:46:54.641 --> 01:46:56.777
UP ACTION TO BILL INVEST TEN

01:46:56.843 --> 01:46:57.410
POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:46:57.477 --> 01:46:58.779
HELL WATER FIX. WE PASSED OUR

01:46:58.845 --> 01:46:59.813
SECOND LARGEST AMOUNT OF

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.348
CONSERVATION FUNDING A HUNDRED

01:47:01.414 --> 01:47:02.182
MILLION DOLLARS WE'RE PUTTING

01:47:02.249 --> 01:47:04.151
INTO CONSERVATION OVER THE NEXT

01:47:04.217 --> 01:47:06.787
BUDGET CYCLE. WE ALSO INVESTED

01:47:06.853 --> 01:47:08.455
IN A THE LARGEST REGIONAL

01:47:08.522 --> 01:47:09.756
RECYCLED WATER PLANT IN A

01:47:09.823 --> 01:47:11.491
PARTNERSHIP WITH LA COUNTY SAN

01:47:11.558 --> 01:47:12.926
DISTRICTS AND WE COMMITTED

01:47:12.993 --> 01:47:14.427
FINANCING TO THAT. SO WE'RE

01:47:14.494 --> 01:47:15.929
COMMITTED TO AN OLD THE ABOVE

01:47:15.996 --> 01:47:17.531
FINANCING APPROACH.

01:47:17.597 --> 01:47:19.599
BUT CALIFORNIA WATER SIX IS PART

01:47:19.666 --> 01:47:21.501
OF THAT NECESSARY PORTFOLIO IN A

01:47:21.568 --> 01:47:22.536

IT DIDN'T MAKE IT LOOK GOOD OF A

01:47:31.178 --> 01:47:31.745
MISCARRIAGE IT JUST INTERESTING

01:47:31.812 --> 01:47:32.179
I MEAN.

WHAT WE USED TO USE AND HOW MUCH

01:47:36.049 --> 01:47:36.817
REASON NOW ANNA MEAN THAT THE

01:47:36.883 --> 01:47:37.450
SAME COULD BE SAID FOR ANYTHING

01:47:37.517 --> 01:47:38.752
RIGHT TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES AND IF

01:47:38.819 --> 01:47:39.653
WE DON'T JUST LOOK AT ONE

01:47:39.719 --> 01:47:41.521

JUST OVERVIEW THE STATE WATER

01:49:22.856 --> 01:49:24.591
PROJECTS I'M IT IS A COMPLEX

01:49:24.658 --> 01:49:27.060
NETWORK OF CANALS AND RESERVOIRS.

01:49:27.127 --> 01:49:29.329

01:49:32.332 --> 01:49:34.034
ENVISIONED SIXTY YEARS AGO.

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:35.602
TODAY TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIANS

01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:36.903
RECEIVE THEIR WATER FROM THIS

01:49:36.970 --> 01:49:38.805
PROJECT. AND THAT INCLUDES

01:49:38.872 --> 01:49:40.273
TWENTY FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS

01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:41.942
AND OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

01:49:42.008 --> 01:49:43.443
THOUSAND ACRES OF FARMLAND IS

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:44.344
IRRIGATED USING STATE WATER

01:49:44.411 --> 01:49:46.680
PROJECT WATER.

01:49:46.746 --> 01:49:48.348
HOWEVER IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE

01:49:48.415 --> 01:49:49.516
THAT THIS WILL BE ON PROVIDED IN

01:49:49.582 --> 01:49:51.451
THE FUTURE. AND AS SUCH WE DO

01:49:51.518 --> 01:49:52.485
BELIEVE WE NEED TO MAKE AN

01:49:52.552 --> 01:49:53.954
INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE TO

01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:55.288
PROVIDE THIS RELIABLE WATER

01:49:55.355 --> 01:49:56.623
SUPPLY.

01:49:56.690 --> 01:49:58.658
WE ARE FACING ENVIRONMENTAL

01:49:58.725 --> 01:49:59.826
CONSTRAINTS THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT

01:49:59.893 --> 01:50:00.961
UP A LOT TODAY IN TERMS OF

01:50:01.027 --> 01:50:03.096
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS WE ALSO HAVE

01:50:03.163 --> 01:50:04.297
AGING AND VULNERABLE

01:50:04.364 --> 01:50:04.864
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH I THINK

01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:07.434
WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH. AND WE

01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:08.268
HAVE A VOLATILE CLIMATE AHEAD

01:50:08.335 --> 01:50:09.102
AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN AN

01:50:09.169 --> 01:50:10.637
INCREASING NUMBER OF.

01:50:10.704 --> 01:50:12.572
REPORTS AND ARTICLES ESPECIALLY

01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:14.074
EVEN IN THE LAST WEEK AND IN

01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:15.775
FACT TODAY IN THE BE ON WHAT

01:50:15.842 --> 01:50:17.510
THIS A CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS

01:50:17.577 --> 01:50:18.244
ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE AN

01:50:18.311 --> 01:50:19.913
EXPERIENCING. THIS CLIMATE

01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:21.748
WHIPLASH ESSENTIALLY BETWEEN

01:50:21.815 --> 01:50:22.949
WETTON DRYERS REQUIRES THAT WE

01:50:23.016 --> 01:50:24.918
THINK MORE CREATIVELY ABOUT THE

01:50:24.985 --> 01:50:26.086
INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE IN ORDER

01:50:26.152 --> 01:50:27.721
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AND MANAGE

01:50:27.787 --> 01:50:29.189
AGAINST.

01:50:29.255 --> 01:50:30.390
THAT WHIPLASH.

01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:32.058
SO WE THINK WATER FIX DOES

01:50:32.125 --> 01:50:33.994
PROVIDE THAT PRUDENT

01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:35.462

01:51:42.462 --> 01:51:43.863
PUBLIC. BOARD MEETINGS AS THEY

01:51:43.930 --> 01:51:46.032
ARE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES TO

01:51:46.099 --> 01:51:47.567
MAKE THEIR RESPECTIVE DECISIONS.

01:51:47.634 --> 01:51:48.568
THEY EACH HAVE TO CONSIDER THEIR

01:51:48.635 --> 01:51:50.737
OWN LOCAL NEEDS THAT THE STATE

01:51:50.804 --> 01:51:51.571
WATER PROJECT.

01:51:51.638 --> 01:51:53.740
IS OF VARYING A PORTION OF

01:51:53.807 --> 01:51:55.642
THEIR PORTFOLIOS SO THEY WILL

01:51:55.708 --> 01:51:56.409
CONSIDER.

01:51:56.476 --> 01:51:58.278
THIS WATER FIX AS PART OF THEIR

01:51:58.344 --> 01:51:59.579
PORTFOLIO AND THEIR INVESTMENT

01:51:59.646 --> 01:52:00.847
STRATEGY.

01:52:00.914 --> 01:52:02.382
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN COMMITTED IN

01:52:02.449 --> 01:52:04.184
THEIR RESOLVE TO STUDYING THE

01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:05.952
OPTIONS LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVES.

01:52:06.019 --> 01:52:07.620
AND AND MAKING THESE.

01:52:07.687 --> 01:52:08.955
INVESTMENTS AND UP AND UP

01:52:09.022 --> 01:52:11.291
PUBLIC AND OPEN MANNER.

01:52:11.357 --> 01:52:12.192
I DID WANT TO TOUCH ON THE FACT

01:52:12.258 --> 01:52:14.994
THAT WATER FIXES NOT OF THE ONLY.

01:52:15.061 --> 01:52:16.496
PROJECT THAT THESE AGENCIES ARE

01:52:16.563 --> 01:52:18.031
PURSUING.

01:52:18.098 --> 01:52:19.032
AS I MENTIONED WE ARE

01:52:19.099 --> 01:52:20.567
RICOCHETING BETWEEN DROUGHT AND

01:52:20.633 --> 01:52:22.368
ATMOSPHERIC STORMS.

01:52:22.435 --> 01:52:23.536
REQUIRED US TO THINK OUTSIDE THE

01:52:23.603 --> 01:52:25.538
BOX AND HOW THESE AGENCIES ARE.

01:52:25.605 --> 01:52:28.441
MANAGING THEIR OWN PORTFOLIOS.

01:52:28.508 --> 01:52:30.410
SO WHILE WATER FIX IS.

01:52:30.477 --> 01:52:33.179
ADVANCING OUR AGENCIES CONTINUE

01:52:33.246 --> 01:52:34.514
TO MAKE INVESTMENTS AND OTHER

01:52:34.581 --> 01:52:36.416
PROJECTS

01:52:36.483 --> 01:52:37.617
WE'RE NOT PICKING ONE SOLUTION

01:52:37.684 --> 01:52:39.385
OVER ANOTHER.

01:52:39.452 --> 01:52:42.255
OF WE'VE IN FACT I'M RATHER MORE

01:52:42.322 --> 01:52:44.891
STORAGE WAS BROUGHT UP ELEVEN OF

01:52:44.958 --> 01:52:45.458
THE STATE WATER CONTRACTOR

01:52:45.525 --> 01:52:50.363
MEMBER AGENCIES ARE CURRENTLY

01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:51.831
INVESTED IN THE SIGHTS OF THE OR.

01:52:51.898 --> 01:52:52.432
SO THEY ARE LOOKING AT OTHER

01:52:52.499 --> 01:52:53.233
WAYS OF.

01:52:53.299 --> 01:52:54.868
PROTECTING THE WHAT THEIR WATER

01:52:54.934 --> 01:52:55.668
SUPPLIES

01:52:55.735 --> 01:52:56.102
IN FACT.

01:52:56.169 --> 01:52:57.837
EVEN THE STABLE WATER SUPPLY

01:52:57.904 --> 01:52:59.172
THE SURFACE SUPPLY THAT WATER

01:52:59.239 --> 01:53:01.808
FIX WILL ESSENTIALLY STABILIZE.

01:53:01.875 --> 01:53:04.210
IS NEEDED TO STABILIZE GROUND

01:53:04.277 --> 01:53:05.778
WATER BASINS THAT THE REALLY Q.

01:53:05.845 --> 01:53:07.981
FACTOR IN THE ABILITY FOR SIGNAL

01:53:08.047 --> 01:53:09.315
TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

01:53:09.382 --> 01:53:10.116
BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME

01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:11.551
EXAMPLES OF WHAT OUR OTHER

01:53:11.618 --> 01:53:13.019
AGENCIES ARE DOING.

01:53:13.086 --> 01:53:14.821
FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T WATER AGENCY

01:53:14.888 --> 01:53:17.223
IS NOW RECYCLING ALMOST ALL OF

01:53:17.290 --> 01:53:19.192
ITS WASTE WATER FOR IRRIGATION.

01:53:19.259 --> 01:53:20.493
AND PERCOLATES ITS TREATED WASTE

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:21.427
WATER RECHARGE THE LOCAL

01:53:21.494 --> 01:53:23.129
GROUNDWATER BASIN AND PUSHES

01:53:23.196 --> 01:53:24.631
AGGRESSIVELY ON ITS CONSERVATION

01:53:24.697 --> 01:53:26.099
AWARENESS PROGRAMS.

01:53:26.166 --> 01:53:27.333
COACHELLA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:28.501
IS IMPLEMENTING A GROUND WATER

01:53:28.568 --> 01:53:29.736
REPLENISHMENT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:53:29.802 --> 01:53:31.538
PROJECT. IN ADDITION TO MILLIONS

01:53:31.604 --> 01:53:32.772
OF DOLLARS OF CONSERVATION

01:53:32.839 --> 01:53:34.407
PROGRAM FUNDING AND AN

01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:35.875
AGGRESSIVE PLAN TO PUT MORE

01:53:35.942 --> 01:53:37.477
CUSTOMERS ON RECYCLED WATER.

01:53:37.544 --> 01:53:38.578
THE SAN BERNARDINO VALLEY

01:53:38.645 --> 01:53:39.879
MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT IS

01:53:39.946 --> 01:53:41.548
INVESTED MILLIONS AND WHETHER

01:53:41.614 --> 01:53:43.283
BASED IRRIGATION CONTROLLERS

01:53:43.349 --> 01:53:44.417
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE PROGRAMS

01:53:44.484 --> 01:53:46.252
TURF REMOVAL. CONSERVATION

01:53:46.319 --> 01:53:47.954
EDUCATION AND OUTREACH AND

01:53:48.021 --> 01:53:49.989
DEMONSTRATION GARDENS IN REBATES

01:53:50.056 --> 01:53:51.391
MOJAVE WATER AGENCY HAS INVESTED

01:53:51.457 --> 01:53:53.193
IN RECHARGE FACILITIES IN

01:53:53.259 --> 01:53:54.260
MULTIPLE GROUND WATER BASINS.

01:53:54.327 --> 01:53:56.162
AND DEVELOP STORAGE PROGRAMS TO

01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:57.497
ENSURE RELIABLE SUPPLIES.

01:53:57.564 --> 01:53:59.332
IN PARALLEL THEY'VE EXECUTED

01:53:59.399 --> 01:54:00.333
AGGRESSIVE CONSERVATION THROUGH.

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:01.935
MEASURES RESULTING IN A THIRTY

01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:03.970
SEVEN PERCENT DECLINE IN PER

01:54:04.037 --> 01:54:05.905
CAPITA BECAUSE PER CAPITAL GAINS.

01:54:05.972 --> 01:54:07.407
SO WHILE THEY CONTINUE TO DO

01:54:07.473 --> 01:54:09.008
MORE LOCALLY AND THEY WELL IT

01:54:09.075 --> 01:54:10.877
DOESN'T MEAN NEGATE THE NEED FOR

01:54:10.944 --> 01:54:12.779
A LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR THE

01:54:12.845 --> 01:54:14.581
STATE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE

01:54:14.647 --> 01:54:15.882

01:54:15.949 --> 01:54:18.117
FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLY.

01:54:18.184 --> 01:54:19.285
SO I THINK WITHOUT.

01:54:19.352 --> 01:54:21.821
ALL BE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS OR

01:54:21.888 --> 01:54:23.890

ARE IMPORTANT TO THE REGION AND

01:55:14.173 --> 01:55:15.575
TO THE ENTIRE STATE WHY IT

01:55:15.642 --> 01:55:18.778
WARRANTS LONG TERM PROTECTIONS.

01:55:18.845 --> 01:55:20.213
UNFORTUNATELY AS REFLECTED IN

CONSISTENTLY VOICE OUR CONCERNS.

01:55:37.563 --> 01:55:38.865
BUT THE STATE'S LESS THAN

01:55:38.931 --> 01:55:39.465
TRANSPARENT EFFORT TO FIX THE

AMOUNTS TO WATER GRAB.

01:55:58.251 --> 01:56:00.153
IT PUTS THE FIVE DELTA COUNTIES

01:56:00.219 --> 01:56:00.920
IN THE CROSS HAIRS OF A LONG

01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:03.956
LIST OF IRREVERSIBLE IMPACTS.

01:56:04.023 --> 01:56:05.792
SOME OF THOSE IMPACTS INCLUDE.

01:56:05.858 --> 01:56:07.026
IRREVERSIBLE CHANGES TO THE WAY

IN THE DELTA.

01:56:35.988 --> 01:56:37.190
IT ALSO DEGRADES THE

THE CALL THE DELTA HOME ARE

01:57:13.559 --> 01:57:14.861
WORTHY OF LONG TERM PROTECTIONS.

01:57:14.927 --> 01:57:15.962
IT SHOULDN'T BE SUBJECTED TO

01:57:36.749 --> 01:57:38.618
EARLIER BY MEMBERS OF THIS BODY.

01:57:38.684 --> 01:57:40.052
CALIFORNIA WATER FIXES FOCUSED

01:57:40.119 --> 01:57:41.621
ON INCREASING WATER EXPORTS FROM

01:57:41.687 --> 01:57:43.756
THE DELTA AND DOES NOT.

01:57:43.823 --> 01:57:45.191
I DON'T BELIEVE ACKNOWLEDGE

01:57:45.258 --> 01:57:46.692
LEGISLATIVE MANDATE TO REDUCE

01:57:46.759 --> 01:57:49.362
DIVERSIONS INVEST AND REGAL

01:57:49.429 --> 01:57:50.029
SUPPLIES.

01:57:50.096 --> 01:57:51.898
I MUST SAY WE ARE VERY SKEPTICAL

01:57:51.964 --> 01:57:54.233
OF HOW. WELL THEY WILL ATTEMPT

01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:55.735
TO PROVE AS I HEARD EARLIER.

01:57:55.802 --> 01:57:57.036
REDUCE RELIANCE ON THE DELTA

01:57:57.103 --> 01:57:57.837
THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX

01:57:57.904 --> 01:57:59.972
PERMITTING PROCESS.

01:58:00.039 --> 01:58:01.407
WE BELIEVE THERE ARE BETTER MORE

01:58:01.474 --> 01:58:02.675
COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO

01:58:02.742 --> 01:58:04.477
REDUCE RELIANCE ON THE DELTA AND

01:58:04.544 --> 01:58:06.145
ADDRESS THE COLECO GOALS.

01:58:06.212 --> 01:58:07.013
ALL ARE FREE PROTECTIONS FOR THE

01:58:07.079 --> 01:58:08.915
DELTA AS WELL.

01:58:08.981 --> 01:58:09.749
THESE COULD INCLUDE IN DO

01:58:09.816 --> 01:58:12.452
INCLUDE INVESTING A STATEWIDE A

01:58:12.518 --> 01:58:13.386
REGIONAL WATER STORY THAT WAS

01:58:13.453 --> 01:58:15.488
DISCUSSED HERE THIS MORNING.

01:58:15.555 --> 01:58:16.722
UPGRADE THE STATE WATER PROJECT

01:58:16.789 --> 01:58:18.524
CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:58:18.591 --> 01:58:19.525
WHICH WE BELIEVE NEEDS TO BE

01:58:19.592 --> 01:58:21.427
TAKEN OUT A HARD LOOK AT THAT.

01:58:21.494 --> 01:58:22.462
INVESTING IN THE LEVY SYSTEM THE

01:58:22.528 --> 01:58:24.430
CURLY EXIST.

01:58:24.497 --> 01:58:25.064
I THINK THE BILL OFF THE LOSS

01:58:25.131 --> 01:58:26.766
THAT EVEN WITH CALIFORNIA WATER

01:58:26.833 --> 01:58:28.868
FIX AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT A

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:29.402
TARGET RELY ON THE CURRENT

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:30.369
SYSTEM.

01:58:30.436 --> 01:58:31.237
YOU TRANSMIT AND CONVEY WATER

01:58:31.304 --> 01:58:33.272
THROUGH THE DELTA.

01:58:33.339 --> 01:58:34.373
WE ALSO BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:35.408
ADDITIONAL SAVINGS FROM

01:58:35.475 --> 01:58:37.076
CONSERVATION OF WATER USE

01:58:37.143 --> 01:58:38.711
EFFICIENCY.

01:58:38.778 --> 01:58:39.512
WE NEED DEVELOP REASONABLE AND

01:58:39.579 --> 01:58:40.213
EFFECTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:58:40.279 --> 01:58:42.582
RESTORATION STRATEGIES.

01:58:42.648 --> 01:58:44.383
A COMPREHENSIVE AND TRANSPARENT

01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:45.918
WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN MUST IN

01:58:45.985 --> 01:58:47.587
OUR VIEW PROVIDE A SECURE WATER

01:58:47.653 --> 01:58:50.256
SUPPLY. AND ASSURE THE QUALITY

01:58:50.323 --> 01:58:51.924
AND RELIABILITY OF SUPPLY.

01:58:51.991 --> 01:58:52.925
AND NOT JUST FORGET SOUTHERN

01:58:52.992 --> 01:58:54.494
CALIFORNIA OR OTHER REASONS A

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:56.262
STATE BEFORE THE FORM DOING

01:58:56.329 --> 01:58:57.930
CALIFORNIANS WHO RESIDE IN OUR

01:58:57.997 --> 01:59:00.032
FIVE COUNTIES IN THE DELTA.

01:59:00.099 --> 01:59:01.367
WE SHOULD ALL AGREE THAT THE

01:59:01.434 --> 01:59:03.636
DELTA IS A VERY SPECIAL PLACE

01:59:03.703 --> 01:59:04.537
IN ACKNOWLEDGE IT BECAUSE HOME

01:59:04.604 --> 01:59:05.304
TO MANY PRECIOUS IN UNIQUE

01:59:05.371 --> 01:59:07.907
RESOURCES.

01:59:07.974 --> 01:59:08.841
BUT BE NO REDIRECTED ADVERSE

01:59:08.908 --> 01:59:10.276
IMPACTS ASSOCIATE WITH A WATER

01:59:10.343 --> 01:59:11.878
SUPPLY SOLUTION FOR SOUTHERN

01:59:11.944 --> 01:59:13.212
CALIFORNIA.

01:59:13.279 --> 01:59:14.247
IN OTHER WORDS DON'T SACRIFICE A

01:59:14.313 --> 01:59:15.815
DELTA

01:59:15.882 --> 01:59:16.449
FOR THE BENEFIT OF OTHER REGIONS

01:59:16.516 --> 01:59:18.985
OF THE STATE.

01:59:19.051 --> 01:59:19.752
ALL THIS REPEAT WHAT I DON'T

01:59:19.819 --> 01:59:21.053
SACRIFICE THE DELTA.

01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:21.687
TO BENEFIT OTHER REGIONS OF THE

01:59:21.754 --> 01:59:22.722
STATE.

01:59:22.788 --> 01:59:24.457
IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE DELTAS

01:59:24.524 --> 01:59:26.826
RESOURCE IS A STATEWIDE ASSETS.

01:59:26.893 --> 01:59:27.460
ARE PROTECTED FOR GENERATIONS TO

01:59:27.527 --> 01:59:29.228
COME.

01:59:29.295 --> 01:59:31.030
IS DEEPLY TROUBLING TO HEAR THIS

01:59:31.097 --> 01:59:32.164
MORNING THAT JOINT POWER

01:59:32.231 --> 01:59:33.599
AUTHORITIES WILL BE FORMED WITH

01:59:33.666 --> 01:59:35.468
NO LOCAL REPRESENTATION.

01:59:35.535 --> 01:59:36.702
AND THERE WILL NOT ONLY OUT

01:59:36.769 --> 01:59:38.838
INSULT INJURY. BY CONSTRUCTING A

01:59:38.905 --> 01:59:40.206
PROJECT BUT THEY WILL DESIGN

01:59:40.273 --> 01:59:42.642
BUILD AND FINANCE THE PROJECT

01:59:42.708 --> 01:59:45.077
THERE ARE FRONT AND BACKYARDS.

01:59:45.144 --> 01:59:46.579
WE SUPPORT THE STATE

01:59:46.646 --> 01:59:47.980
LEGISLATURES A ROLL AND

01:59:48.047 --> 01:59:49.515
CERTAINLY RESPECTED IN

01:59:49.582 --> 01:59:51.217
PROTECTING THE DELTA. AND WE

01:59:51.284 --> 01:59:52.852
SUPPORT YOUR OVERSIGHT AND I CAN

01:59:52.919 --> 01:59:54.954
ENGAGEMENT IN THIS PROCESS.

01:59:55.021 --> 01:59:57.757
IN OUR VIEW THERE IS NO DEBATE.

01:59:57.823 --> 01:59:58.691
THIS DOCUMENT SAN JOAQUIN DELTA

01:59:58.758 --> 02:00:01.360
IS A VALUABLE IN IRREPLACEABLE

02:00:01.427 --> 02:00:03.396
RESOURCE WHAT MANY.

02:00:03.462 --> 02:00:05.097
SPECIAL ATTRIBUTES.

02:00:05.164 --> 02:00:07.767
IT WARNS LONG TERM PROTECTIONS.

02:00:07.833 --> 02:00:09.068
ANY FUTURE WATER MANAGEMENT OR

02:00:09.135 --> 02:00:11.037
LAND USE POLICY CHANGES SHOULD

02:00:11.103 --> 02:00:12.471
NOT IN OUR VIEW CANNOT

02:00:12.538 --> 02:00:13.573
CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIMINISHMENT

02:00:13.639 --> 02:00:15.374
OR DESTRUCTION OF THE DELTA.

02:00:15.441 --> 02:00:16.342
WE DESERVE BETTER THAN THE

02:00:16.409 --> 02:00:17.877
CALIFORNIA WATER FIX.

02:00:17.944 --> 02:00:20.680
AND SO DOES ALL OF CALIFORNIA.

02:00:20.746 --> 02:00:21.447
I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE

02:00:21.514 --> 02:00:22.648
CHAIRS AND ALL OF HIS MEMBERS

02:00:22.715 --> 02:00:24.817
THE OPPORTUNITY ADDRESS YOU.

02:00:24.884 --> 02:00:26.252
IN ANY EVENT YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY

02:00:26.319 --> 02:00:27.520
DONE SO AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF

02:00:27.587 --> 02:00:29.922
YOU RESIDE IT'S ONLY HAVE DONE

02:00:29.989 --> 02:00:31.791
SO RESIDE ADULT IT DOES SO.

02:00:31.857 --> 02:00:32.925
THE DELTA COUNTY'S COALITION

02:00:32.992 --> 02:00:34.126
WELCOMES YOU TO FOR TWO OR THE

02:00:34.193 --> 02:00:35.628
DELTA TO EXPERIENCE THE AWESOME

02:00:35.695 --> 02:00:38.397
WONDER. THIS VERY SPECIAL PLACE.

02:00:38.464 --> 02:00:39.332
THAT WE KNOW IS WORTH PROTECTING

02:00:39.398 --> 02:00:41.133
AND SAVING.

02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:42.568
WE WANT TO BE APART A SOLUTION

02:00:42.635 --> 02:00:44.604
WE STAND READY TO BE A PARTNER.

02:00:44.670 --> 02:00:45.571
WE DON'T BELIEVE THE PRINT

02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:46.405
TITLES A CALIFORNIA WATER FIX IS

02:00:46.472 --> 02:00:48.140
THE ANSWER.

02:00:48.207 --> 02:00:50.142
THANK YOU MUCH SUPERVISOR.

02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:51.677
I'M PRUNING.

02:00:51.744 --> 02:00:53.512
MR.

02:00:53.579 --> 02:00:56.148
OKAY.

02:00:56.215 --> 02:00:57.583
GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS

02:00:57.650 --> 02:00:58.951
MY NAME IS DOUG BG I'M A SENIOR

02:00:59.018 --> 02:00:59.952
ATTORNEY WITH THE NATURAL

02:01:00.019 --> 02:01:01.554
RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. SINCE

02:01:01.621 --> 02:01:03.055
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN IT WHEN

02:01:03.122 --> 02:01:03.889
I FIRST BEGAN WORKING ON THE BAY

02:01:03.956 --> 02:01:05.958
DELTA CONSERVATION PLAN THAT

02:01:06.025 --> 02:01:07.460
BECAME WATER FIX.

02:01:07.526 --> 02:01:08.861
AN RTC STRONGLY OPPOSES THE

02:01:08.928 --> 02:01:10.963
WATER FIX PROJECT BECAUSE FOR

02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:11.564
THREE REASONS WHICH I WANT TO

02:01:11.631 --> 02:01:12.632
DISCUSS TODAY.

02:01:12.698 --> 02:01:14.133
FIRST THE PROJECT IS ACTUALLY

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:15.935
WORSE THAN THE DEGRADED STATUS

02:01:16.002 --> 02:01:17.269
QUO FOR FISH THAT MIGRATE

02:01:17.336 --> 02:01:18.904
THROUGH THE DELTA DESPITE HOW

02:01:18.971 --> 02:01:20.573
BAG CURRENT CONDITIONS ARE.

02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:22.375
SECOND THE FINANCING FOR THIS

02:01:22.441 --> 02:01:24.243
PROJECT WILL DIVERT MUCH NEEDED

02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:25.978
FUNDING AWAY FROM REALISTIC

02:01:26.045 --> 02:01:27.380
LOCAL WATER SUPPLY SOLUTIONS

02:01:27.446 --> 02:01:28.981
THAT WILL ENABLE REDUCE RELIANCE

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:30.683
ON THE PART ON THE DELTA. AND

02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:32.885
THIRD. THAT THE FINANCING SCHEME

02:01:32.952 --> 02:01:34.720
FOR WATER FIX APPEARS TO VIOLATE

02:01:34.787 --> 02:01:36.822
STATE AND FEDERAL THE STATE LAWS

02:01:36.889 --> 02:01:38.557
AND CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS

02:01:38.624 --> 02:01:40.126
THAT RACE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS

02:01:40.192 --> 02:01:40.660
ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF THE

02:01:40.726 --> 02:01:42.595
FINANCING.

02:01:42.662 --> 02:01:43.829
JUST A STEP BACK IN TWENTY

02:01:43.896 --> 02:01:45.297
THIRTEEN ENERGY C. ACTUALLY

02:01:45.364 --> 02:01:46.365
PROPOSED WHAT WE CALL THE

02:01:46.432 --> 02:01:47.633
PORTFOLIO ALTERNATIVE FOR THE

02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:49.468
DELTA WHICH INCLUDED A SINGLE

02:01:49.535 --> 02:01:51.103
TUNNEL AND NEW INTAKE ON THE

02:01:51.170 --> 02:01:52.471
NORTH DELTA. NEW.

02:01:52.538 --> 02:01:54.440
INVESTMENTS IN LEVY STABILITY

02:01:54.507 --> 02:01:56.575
AND STORAGE SOUTH OF THE DELTA

02:01:56.642 --> 02:01:57.743
AN OPERATING RULES THAT WOULD

02:01:57.810 --> 02:02:00.079
REDUCE DIVERSIONS FROM THE DELTA

02:02:00.146 --> 02:02:00.746
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE

02:02:00.813 --> 02:02:02.448
ENVIRONMENT BUT WOULD BE PAIRED

02:02:02.515 --> 02:02:04.350
WITH INVESTMENTS IN LOCAL AND

02:02:04.417 --> 02:02:05.751
REGIONAL WATER SUPPLIES. AND THE

02:02:05.818 --> 02:02:07.586
STATE REFUSED TO EVEN STUDY THIS

02:02:07.653 --> 02:02:09.288
AT ALL IT WAS REJECTED OUT OF

02:02:09.355 --> 02:02:11.123
HAND SO ENERGY SEE DOES NOT HAVE

02:02:11.190 --> 02:02:13.759
A FORMAL JUST SAY NO POSITION ON

02:02:13.826 --> 02:02:15.161
THE TUNNELS.

02:02:15.227 --> 02:02:16.462
WHAT WE HAVE EVALUATED THIS A

02:02:16.529 --> 02:02:17.863
SPECIFIC PROJECT BEFORE US IN

02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:19.532
THE SPECIFIC PROJECT IS BAD FOR

02:02:19.598 --> 02:02:20.466
THE DELTA AND IS BAD FOR THE

02:02:20.533 --> 02:02:23.469
STATE OF CALIFORNIA?

02:02:23.536 --> 02:02:24.103
THE BAY DELTA IS AN ECOLOGICAL

02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:26.172
CRISIS

02:02:26.238 --> 02:02:27.640
WE'VE WATCHED FISH AND WILDLIFE

02:02:27.707 --> 02:02:28.574
THAT HAVE BEEN NATIVE TO THIS

02:02:28.641 --> 02:02:31.510
AREA FOR GENERATIONS MILLENNIUM.

02:02:31.577 --> 02:02:33.312
ON THE VERY BRINK OF EXTINCTION

02:02:33.379 --> 02:02:35.247
DUE TO HABITAT LOSS OVER

02:02:35.314 --> 02:02:37.717
DIVERSION OF WATER ENTRAINMENT

02:02:37.783 --> 02:02:39.318
CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER FACTS.

02:02:39.385 --> 02:02:40.720
AND YET DESPITE HOW BAD THE

02:02:40.786 --> 02:02:42.788
STATUS QUO IS.

02:02:42.855 --> 02:02:44.523
AND IT'S REALLY BAD THE FEDERAL

02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:45.424
GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY WHEN WE

02:02:45.491 --> 02:02:47.626
INITIATED CONSULTATION TO REDO

02:02:47.693 --> 02:02:49.295
THOSE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS FROM

02:02:49.361 --> 02:02:50.062
TWO THOUSAND ANDTWO THOUSAND

02:02:50.129 --> 02:02:51.731
NINE. BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T

02:02:51.797 --> 02:02:53.032
IMPLEMENTED DURING THE DROUGHT

02:02:53.099 --> 02:02:54.266
AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE FAILED TO

02:02:54.333 --> 02:02:56.268
PROTECT LISTED SPECIES.

02:02:56.335 --> 02:02:57.570
AND YET DESPITE HOW BAD THE

02:02:57.636 --> 02:02:59.105
STATUS QUO IS FOR NATIVE FISH

02:02:59.171 --> 02:03:00.339
LIKE SALMON. WATER FIX IS

02:03:00.406 --> 02:03:02.007
ACTUALLY WORSE.

02:03:02.074 --> 02:03:03.542
THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AND THE

02:03:03.609 --> 02:03:04.910
INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT ISSUED BY

02:03:04.977 --> 02:03:05.911
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

02:03:05.978 --> 02:03:07.546
OFFICIAL WILDLIFE MAKE CLEAR.

02:03:07.613 --> 02:03:09.248
THAT THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX

02:03:09.315 --> 02:03:10.883
PROJECT WILL REDUCE SURVIVAL OF

02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:12.752
SALMON THROUGH THE DELTA COMING

02:03:12.818 --> 02:03:14.053
DOWN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER

02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:14.987
DESPITE HOW BAD CONDITIONS ARE

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:16.388
TODAY.

02:03:16.455 --> 02:03:17.790
WILL REDUCE THE ABUNDANCE OF

02:03:17.857 --> 02:03:19.892
LONG THIN SMELT A STATE THREAT

02:03:19.959 --> 02:03:21.560
LISTED THREATENED SPECIES.

02:03:21.627 --> 02:03:23.596
DUE TO INCREASED DIVERSIONS.

02:03:23.662 --> 02:03:25.231
IT WILL HARM AND REDUCE THE

02:03:25.297 --> 02:03:27.032
ABUNDANCE OF DELTA SMELL.

02:03:27.099 --> 02:03:28.868
SO FOR THE MOST CRITICALLY

02:03:28.934 --> 02:03:30.369
ENDANGERED SPECIES IN CALIFORNIA

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:31.537
WATER FIX IS ACTUALLY WORSE THAN

02:03:31.604 --> 02:03:33.205
THE STATUS QUO.

02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:34.273
AND ALSO HARM FALL RUN CHINOOK

02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:35.641
SALMON WHICH FORM THE BACKBONE

02:03:35.708 --> 02:03:38.210
OF THE STATE'S SALMON FISHERY.

02:03:38.277 --> 02:03:39.578
TODAY THE US FISH WILDLIFE

02:03:39.645 --> 02:03:40.913
SERVICE ISSUED A BIOLOGICAL

02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:42.448
OPINION THAT AMAZINGLY ONLY

02:03:42.515 --> 02:03:43.749
COVERS PART OF THE CONSTRUCTION

02:03:43.816 --> 02:03:45.151
OF THIS PROJECT IT DOES NOT EVEN

02:03:45.217 --> 02:03:46.152
AUTHORIZE OPERATION OF THIS

02:03:46.218 --> 02:03:47.720
PROJECT.

02:03:47.787 --> 02:03:48.754
AND THE NATIONAL MARINE

02:03:48.821 --> 02:03:49.622
FISHERIES SERVICE BIOLOGICAL

02:03:49.688 --> 02:03:51.891
OPINION ONLY OPERATE AUTHORIZES

02:03:51.957 --> 02:03:53.025
OPERATIONS TO THE YEAR TWENTY

02:03:53.092 --> 02:03:54.493
THIRTY WHICH IS BEFORE THE

02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:55.528
PROJECT WOULD EVEN BE COMPLETELY

02:03:55.594 --> 02:03:56.962
CONSTRUCTED.

02:03:57.029 --> 02:03:58.330
AND SO IT'S CLEAR THAT THE

02:03:58.397 --> 02:03:59.598
PERMITS FOR THIS PROJECT REALLY

02:03:59.665 --> 02:04:01.333
DO NOT PROVIDE OPERATIONS IN THE

02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:02.368
LONG TERM OR ANY CERTAINTY ABOUT

02:04:02.434 --> 02:04:05.070
WATER SUPPLY.

02:04:05.137 --> 02:04:06.605
IN ADDITION THERE ARE NUMEROUS

02:04:06.672 --> 02:04:08.073
CHALLENGES TO THOSE EXISTING

02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:09.508
PERMITS AND TO THE SECRET

02:04:09.575 --> 02:04:10.309
DOCUMENTS MORE THAN TWENTY

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:11.577
PARTIES HAVE FILED.

02:04:11.644 --> 02:04:12.745
LITIGATION AND THE CALIFORNIA

02:04:12.812 --> 02:04:15.381
AND IN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT.

02:04:15.447 --> 02:04:16.816
US SEVERAL PARTIES INCLUDING

02:04:16.882 --> 02:04:17.850
PARTIES REPRESENTED BY THAT

02:04:17.917 --> 02:04:18.918
AFTER RESOURCE DEFENSE COUNSEL

02:04:18.984 --> 02:04:20.152
HAVE CHALLENGE THOSE FEDERAL

02:04:20.219 --> 02:04:22.221
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AS WELL AS

02:04:22.288 --> 02:04:23.489
THE STATE CALIFORNIA.

02:04:23.556 --> 02:04:24.323
SHE'S MADE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED

02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:26.492
SPECIES ACT PERMITS.

02:04:26.559 --> 02:04:28.661
AND IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THERE

02:04:28.727 --> 02:04:30.229
ARE NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES

02:04:30.296 --> 02:04:31.664
THERE'S A GREAT LIKELIHOOD THAT

02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:33.532
ONE OR MORE OF THOSE LITIGATION

02:04:33.599 --> 02:04:34.667
WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN

02:04:34.733 --> 02:04:36.068
INVALIDATING PERMITS BECAUSE

02:04:36.135 --> 02:04:38.204
THEY SIMPLY DO NOT PROTECT. OUR

02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:39.438
ENDANGERED FISH AND WILDLIFE.

02:04:39.505 --> 02:04:41.307
MOREOVER.

02:04:41.373 --> 02:04:42.308
AS YOU HEARD THIS MORNING THE

02:04:42.374 --> 02:04:43.742
STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL

02:04:43.809 --> 02:04:45.611
BOARD IS STILL CONSIDERING THE

02:04:45.678 --> 02:04:46.245
PETITION TO CHANGE THE POINT A

02:04:46.312 --> 02:04:48.147
DIVERSION. AND THE BOARD HAS THE

02:04:48.214 --> 02:04:49.748
AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:04:49.815 --> 02:04:51.917
IMPOSE APPROPRIATE FOR CRITERIA

02:04:51.984 --> 02:04:53.485
WHICH ARE TO BE INFORMED BY HE

02:04:53.552 --> 02:04:54.920
TWENTY TEN PUBLIC TRUST FLOWS

02:04:54.987 --> 02:04:57.122
REPORT. WHICH REQUIRED WHICH

02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:57.723
FOUND THAT THE BEST AVAILABLE

02:04:57.790 --> 02:04:59.191
SCIENCE.

02:04:59.258 --> 02:05:00.726
WOULD JUSTIFY SIGNIFICANT

02:05:00.793 --> 02:05:02.127
REDUCTIONS IN DIVERSIONS AND

02:05:02.194 --> 02:05:03.562
INCREASE FLOWS THROUGH THE DELTA

02:05:03.629 --> 02:05:05.931
TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT.

02:05:05.998 --> 02:05:07.666
AS A RESULT WE BELIEVE THE

02:05:07.733 --> 02:05:09.568
SCIENCE IS VERY CLEAR THAT IN

02:05:09.635 --> 02:05:10.469
ORDER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF

02:05:10.536 --> 02:05:12.438
THIS ESTUARY WE NEED TO REDUCE

02:05:12.504 --> 02:05:13.939
RELIANCE ON THE DELTA AND REDUCE

02:05:14.006 --> 02:05:15.441
DIVERGENCE AND INCREASE THE

02:05:15.507 --> 02:05:16.408
AMOUNT OF WATER FLOWING THROUGH

02:05:16.475 --> 02:05:18.310
THE ESTUARY. AND YET WATER FIX

02:05:18.377 --> 02:05:19.945
DOES THE OPPOSITE.

02:05:20.012 --> 02:05:21.280
ANY PARTICULAR WATER FIX

02:05:21.347 --> 02:05:22.915
PROPOSES TO INCREASED DIVERSIONS

02:05:22.982 --> 02:05:24.083
DURING THE DRY AND CRITICALLY

02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:26.051
DRY YEARS AND ACTUALLY WILL NOT

02:05:26.118 --> 02:05:27.186
INCREASED DIVERGENCE DURING THE

02:05:27.253 --> 02:05:28.787
WET YEARS. BECAUSE WITHOUT

02:05:28.854 --> 02:05:29.655
ADDITIONAL SOUTH ADULT OF

02:05:29.722 --> 02:05:31.323
STORAGE WE SIMPLY CAN'T MOVE

02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:32.892
MORE WATER IN A YEAR LIKE TWENTY

02:05:32.958 --> 02:05:35.094
SEVENTEEN.

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:36.695
SECOND THERE ARE.

02:05:36.762 --> 02:05:38.631
SIGNIFICANT COST EFFECTIVE LOCAL

02:05:38.697 --> 02:05:40.633

02:05:40.699 --> 02:05:42.534
TYPICALLY IN URBAN AREAS

02:05:42.601 --> 02:05:43.702
THAT THE FUNDING FOR WATER FIX

02:05:43.769 --> 02:05:45.271
JEOPARDIZES.

02:05:45.337 --> 02:05:46.906
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU SEE

02:05:46.972 --> 02:05:48.340
THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO THE SAN

02:05:48.407 --> 02:05:49.708
DIEGO COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY AND

02:05:49.775 --> 02:05:51.443
THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES.

02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:53.279
HISTORICALLY VOTING AGAINST

02:05:53.345 --> 02:05:54.980
FUNDING BETWEEN TUNNELS PROJECTS

02:05:55.047 --> 02:05:56.115
BECAUSE OF CONCERNS THAT THIS

02:05:56.181 --> 02:05:57.483
PROJECT WOULD ACTUALLY DIVERT

02:05:57.549 --> 02:05:58.684
THE NEEDED FUNDING AWAY FROM

02:05:58.751 --> 02:06:00.152
THOSE SOLUTIONS LIKE INCREASED

02:06:00.219 --> 02:06:02.187
WATER RECYCLING STORM WATER

02:06:02.254 --> 02:06:04.089
CAPTURE. IMPROVED EFFICIENCY AND

02:06:04.156 --> 02:06:06.759
OTHER LOCAL SUPPLY PROJECTS.

02:06:06.825 --> 02:06:07.793
AS YOU HEARD THE DELTA REFORM

02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:09.194
ACT REQUIRES US TO REDUCE

02:06:09.261 --> 02:06:11.397
RELIANCE ON THE DELTA. AND AN

02:06:11.463 --> 02:06:12.598
RTC HAS PREPARED A NUMBER OF

02:06:12.665 --> 02:06:13.799

02:06:13.866 --> 02:06:15.134
INCLUDING OUR TWENTY FOURTEEN

UNTAPPED POTENTIAL REPORT. WHICH

02:06:17.036 --> 02:06:19.071
IDENTIFIED MILLIONS OF ACRE FEET

02:06:19.138 --> 02:06:20.940
OF POTENTIAL NEW WATER SUPPLIES

02:06:21.006 --> 02:06:22.508
FROM WHICH WATER RECYCLING

02:06:22.574 --> 02:06:23.943
IMPROVED EFFICIENCY AND STORM

02:06:24.009 --> 02:06:25.878
WATER CAPTURE. AND ARE TWENTY

02:06:25.945 --> 02:06:27.579
SEVENTEEN MISMATCH REPORT WHICH

02:06:27.646 --> 02:06:29.048
FOUND THAT AS COMPARED TO THEM

02:06:29.114 --> 02:06:30.482
URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS OF

02:06:30.549 --> 02:06:31.884
ITS MEMBER AGENCIES.

02:06:31.951 --> 02:06:33.319
METROPOLITANS URBAN WATER

02:06:33.385 --> 02:06:34.687
MANAGEMENT PLAN OVERESTIMATES

02:06:34.753 --> 02:06:36.288
DEMAND FOR IMPORTED WATER

02:06:36.355 --> 02:06:38.490
UNDERESTIMATES LOCAL SUPPLIES

02:06:38.557 --> 02:06:39.792
AND CREATES THE PERSON THE

02:06:39.858 --> 02:06:41.160
OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY

02:06:41.226 --> 02:06:42.494
REDUCE.

02:06:42.561 --> 02:06:43.629
DIVERSIONS FROM THE DELTA WHILE

02:06:43.696 --> 02:06:46.465
SUSTAINING THE ECONOMY.

02:06:46.532 --> 02:06:47.666
WHAT A FIX IS GOING TO COST

02:06:47.733 --> 02:06:49.435
WATER DISTRICTS TENS OF BILLIONS

02:06:49.501 --> 02:06:50.035
OF DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FORTY

02:06:50.102 --> 02:06:51.203
YEARS?

02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:52.304
THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS

02:06:52.371 --> 02:06:53.839
INCLUDING FINANCING IS AS MUCH

02:06:53.906 --> 02:06:54.974
AS FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:56.842
OR MORE.

02:06:56.909 --> 02:06:57.977
AND THAT FUNDING IS MONEY THAT

02:06:58.043 --> 02:06:59.211
CANNOT BE SPENT ON THESE LOCAL

02:06:59.278 --> 02:07:02.214
SUPPLY PROJECTS.

02:07:02.281 --> 02:07:03.749
FINALLY WE ARE CONCERNED THAT

02:07:03.816 --> 02:07:05.017
THE FINANCING SCHEME FOR WATER

02:07:05.084 --> 02:07:07.019
FIX VIOLATE STATE LAW.

02:07:07.086 --> 02:07:07.987
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE

SUPERIOR COURT TO VALIDATE.

02:07:12.858 --> 02:07:14.360
NEARLY ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN

02:07:18.964 --> 02:07:20.099
ANTICIPATED THE STATE WATER

02:07:20.165 --> 02:07:22.601
PROJECT WILL PAY FOR.

02:07:22.668 --> 02:07:23.969
HOWEVER AS YOU'VE HEARD THE

CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT

RECLAMATION IS NOT PARTICIPATE.

02:07:29.441 --> 02:07:31.043
AS A RESULT METROPOLITAN IS

02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:33.846
VOTED TO PAY FOR NEARLY TWICE A

THEIR ORIGINAL INVESTMENT IN

02:07:37.716 --> 02:07:38.450
ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF THE

TOTAL COST

02:07:39.852 --> 02:07:40.886
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD

02:07:40.953 --> 02:07:42.054
ONLY GET TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF

02:07:42.121 --> 02:07:42.588
THE WATER SUPPLY FROM THIS

02:07:42.654 --> 02:07:44.223
PROJECT.

02:07:44.289 --> 02:07:46.058
THAT RAISES SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:48.427
ABOUT A. WHETHER METROPOLITANS

02:07:48.494 --> 02:07:50.329

THAN THEIR SHARE OF THE PROJECT.

02:07:57.903 --> 02:07:59.638
IN ADDITION.

02:07:59.705 --> 02:08:00.906
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS

02:08:00.973 --> 02:08:02.441
THAT THE FINANCING FOR THIS

02:08:02.508 --> 02:08:04.843
PROJECT ASSUMES THAT STATE WATER

02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:06.879
PROJECT CONTRACTORS CAN CONTINUE

02:08:06.945 --> 02:08:10.182

02:08:11.717 --> 02:08:13.285
HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL. THERE

02:08:13.352 --> 02:08:14.853
ARE LEGITIMATE ARGUMENTS THAT

02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:16.588
PROPOSITION THIRTEEN PROHIBITS

02:08:29.334 --> 02:08:30.602
IN THE VALIDATION ACTION ENERGY

ANSWER WHICH WAS DENIED AND WE

02:08:46.685 --> 02:08:47.653
EXPECT THIS LITIGATION WILL

02:08:47.719 --> 02:08:50.889
CONTINUE.

02:08:50.956 --> 02:08:52.424
ULTIMATELY ENERGY SHE OPPOSES

02:08:52.491 --> 02:08:53.959
THE WATER FIX PROJECT BECAUSE IT

02:08:54.026 --> 02:08:55.060
IS WORSE THAN THE STATUS QUO

02:08:55.127 --> 02:08:56.628
ENVIRONMENTALLY. BECAUSE IT

02:08:56.695 --> 02:08:58.297
DIVERTS MUCH NEEDED FUNDING AWAY

02:08:58.363 --> 02:09:00.365
FROM REALISTIC SOLUTIONS AND

02:09:00.432 --> 02:09:01.400
BECAUSE THE FINANCING SCHEME

02:09:01.467 --> 02:09:02.968
APPEARS TO BE INVALID AND RAISES

02:09:03.035 --> 02:09:04.503
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE

02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:06.105
ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO MEET

02:09:06.171 --> 02:09:08.841
ITS. CO EQUAL GOALS OF IMPROVING.

02:09:08.907 --> 02:09:10.742
OF THE DELTA ECOSYSTEM AND

02:09:10.809 --> 02:09:12.444
REDUCING RELIANCE ON THE DELTA

02:09:12.511 --> 02:09:14.780
WHILE SUSTAINING WATER SUPPLIES

02:09:14.847 --> 02:09:15.981
AND THE ECONOMY. THANK YOU.

02:09:16.048 --> 02:09:17.216
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:09:17.282 --> 02:09:19.451
RESERVE.

02:09:19.518 --> 02:09:21.019
GOOD MORNING I'M I'M OCEAN

02:09:21.086 --> 02:09:22.921
OBSERVE I REPRESENT FRIENDS OF

02:09:22.988 --> 02:09:24.156
STONE LAKES NATIONAL WILDLIFE

02:09:24.223 --> 02:09:26.425
REFUGE. A LOCAL AGENCIES OF THE

02:09:26.492 --> 02:09:28.060
NORTH DELTA IN IN THE LITIGATION

02:09:28.127 --> 02:09:30.062
THAT I'M MISTER BIJAN MENTIONED

02:09:30.129 --> 02:09:31.897
ABOUT THE SEQUEL REVIEW. AND MY

02:09:31.964 --> 02:09:33.465
REPRESENT FOR THE FIVE DELTA

02:09:33.532 --> 02:09:36.468
COUNTIES AS WELL. I'M AND.

02:09:36.535 --> 02:09:37.970
YOU KNOW I WANT TO JUST ADD ON

02:09:38.036 --> 02:09:39.705
AND NOT REPEAT TO WHAT'S ALREADY

02:09:39.771 --> 02:09:43.142
BEEN SAID BUT IN GENERAL THIS

02:09:43.208 --> 02:09:44.343
PROJECT SHOULD BE JUDGED IN IT

02:09:44.409 --> 02:09:46.245
IS A MEGA PROJECT BECAUSE THE

02:09:46.311 --> 02:09:48.313
COST IS IN THE BILLIONS. AND IT

02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:49.615
SHOULD BE JUDGED ON THE MERITS

02:09:49.681 --> 02:09:50.749
OF WHAT IT CAN DELIVER IN

02:09:50.816 --> 02:09:52.718
COMPARISON TO OTHER OPTIONS NOT

02:09:52.784 --> 02:09:54.453
EMOTIONAL SCARE TACTICS ABOUT

02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:56.455
WHAT MAY HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE.

02:09:56.522 --> 02:09:59.224
AND YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH THE

02:09:59.291 --> 02:10:00.626
COMMENTS BEFORE THAT

02:10:00.692 --> 02:10:01.927
CONSERVATION AND OTHER

02:10:01.994 --> 02:10:03.762
ALTERNATIVES IF FOR FULLY.

02:10:03.829 --> 02:10:06.865
DEVELOPED CAN DELIVER THE WATER

02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:08.367
THAT THE STATE NEEDS.

02:10:08.433 --> 02:10:08.567
NOW.

02:10:08.634 --> 02:10:11.236
WITH RESPECT TO THE MOUNTAIN OF

02:10:11.303 --> 02:10:12.738
ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS I

02:10:12.804 --> 02:10:14.039
JUST WANT TO STRESS THIS IS NOT

02:10:14.106 --> 02:10:16.175
A BENIGN PROJECT I'VE HEARD THAT

02:10:16.241 --> 02:10:18.510
TERM USED A LOT. AN IT IS NOT

02:10:18.577 --> 02:10:19.745
BENIGN AND I THINK SUPERVISOR

02:10:19.811 --> 02:10:22.047
NATOLI HAS MADE THAT CLEAR.

02:10:22.114 --> 02:10:25.050
AND EVEN IF THE NUMBER OF ACRES

02:10:25.117 --> 02:10:26.852
OF WETLANDS FILL GOES DOWN TO A

02:10:26.919 --> 02:10:28.620
FEW HUNDRED RATHER THAN SEVEN OR

02:10:28.687 --> 02:10:30.189
EIGHT HUNDRED THAT'S STILL THE

02:10:30.255 --> 02:10:32.224
LARGEST FILL OF WETLANDS THAT

02:10:32.291 --> 02:10:33.458
WE'VE HEARD OF IN THE STATE.

02:10:33.525 --> 02:10:35.827
I'M THERE'S ALSO MASSIVE ENERGY

02:10:35.894 --> 02:10:36.128
DEMANDS.

02:10:37.663 --> 02:10:39.298
I HAD A HANDOUT ACTUALLY I DON'T

02:10:39.364 --> 02:10:41.300
KNOW IF THAT WENT OUT.

02:10:41.366 --> 02:10:42.935
HOW PERFECT OKAY SO THAT SHOWS

02:10:43.001 --> 02:10:44.503
HOW IT LAYS DOWN ON THE STONE

02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:45.871
MAKES NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE

02:10:45.938 --> 02:10:47.539
AND YOU CAN KIND OF SEE HOW IT

02:10:47.606 --> 02:10:49.641
SQUEEZING OTHER REFUGE IN

02:10:49.708 --> 02:10:51.410
BETWEEN THE EXPANDING OUT GROVE

02:10:51.476 --> 02:10:53.378
AND THE DELTA WHICH IS?

02:10:53.445 --> 02:10:55.747
LARGELY PROTECTED AREA I'M FOR

02:10:55.814 --> 02:10:56.148
BIRDS.

02:10:56.215 --> 02:10:58.584
SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

02:10:58.650 --> 02:10:59.851
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE.

02:10:59.918 --> 02:11:01.320
STANHOPE CRANES WHICH WE'VE GOT

02:11:01.386 --> 02:11:02.354
A PICTURE OF OUT ON THE SECOND

02:11:02.421 --> 02:11:03.288
PAGE

02:11:03.355 --> 02:11:04.656
I AM AND I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:11:04.723 --> 02:11:06.091
IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT

02:11:06.158 --> 02:11:07.726
THERE ARE A LOT OF FISH IN THE

02:11:07.793 --> 02:11:09.861
NORTH DELTA AND SOMETIMES YOU

02:11:09.928 --> 02:11:12.464
MAY HEAR. IT SPOKEN OF AS THOUGH

02:11:12.531 --> 02:11:14.399
ITS AVOIDING FISH BY HAVING

02:11:14.466 --> 02:11:15.334
THESE MASSIVE DIVERSIONS WHICH

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:16.868
HAVE GOT A PICTURE OF A MOCK UP

02:11:16.935 --> 02:11:18.737
THERE FROM THE ER. THAT THAT

02:11:18.804 --> 02:11:20.372
THERE WILL BE AWAY FROM FISH

02:11:20.439 --> 02:11:22.040
THERE MAY BE FEWER SMELT IN THAT

02:11:22.107 --> 02:11:23.475
PARTICULAR AREA BUT THERE ARE A

02:11:23.542 --> 02:11:26.044
LOT OF OTHER FISH AND LIKE MR

02:11:26.111 --> 02:11:28.313
OBG MENTIONED. AS SEVERAL

02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:29.948
SPECIES OF PROTECTED FISH ARE

02:11:30.015 --> 02:11:31.817
GOING TO BE LIKELY TO ADVERSELY

02:11:31.883 --> 02:11:34.019
BE AFFECTED.

02:11:34.086 --> 02:11:34.886
AND THEN IN ADDITION OURS

02:11:34.953 --> 02:11:36.989
FALL RUN CHINOOK SALMON IS IS

02:11:37.055 --> 02:11:39.658
VERY THREATENED BY THIS AND AND

02:11:39.725 --> 02:11:41.493
I THINK AND PETROLEUM CERTAIN

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:42.761
ITALY MENTIONED BY A NEEDS TO BE

02:11:42.828 --> 02:11:44.029
EMPHASIZED THAT THE BETTER WATER

02:11:44.096 --> 02:11:46.064
QUALITY THAT YOU HEAR. THE WATER

02:11:46.131 --> 02:11:47.966
CONTRACTORS IN GW ARE TALKING

02:11:48.033 --> 02:11:49.835
ABOUT FOR EXPORTS COMES AT A

02:11:49.901 --> 02:11:50.836
SPECIFIC COST

02:11:50.902 --> 02:11:52.471
TO THE WATER QUALITY FOR THE

02:11:52.537 --> 02:11:54.006
FOUR MILLION PEOPLE IN THE IN

02:11:54.072 --> 02:11:56.208
OUR AREA. IN A LOT OF THOSE AND

02:11:56.275 --> 02:11:56.775
I'VE GOT A LITTLE CHART.

02:11:57.943 --> 02:12:00.312
OUR LIVE ON PAGE THREE.

02:12:00.379 --> 02:12:02.948
THAT SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS IT WITH

02:12:03.015 --> 02:12:04.049
THAT THEY HAVEN'T EVEN REALLY

02:12:04.116 --> 02:12:05.584
LOOKED AT CAREFULLY WHAT HAPPENS

02:12:05.651 --> 02:12:06.852
TO THE WATER SUPPLIES FOR

02:12:06.918 --> 02:12:07.786
STOCKTON FOR INSTANCE.

02:12:07.853 --> 02:12:08.954
I'M.

02:12:09.021 --> 02:12:10.922
SO.

02:12:10.989 --> 02:12:13.325
IN IN THERE'S NO PLAN ALSO YOU

02:12:13.392 --> 02:12:15.227
HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE IDEA OF

02:12:15.294 --> 02:12:16.995
DIVERTING AT HIGH FLOWS BUT IF

02:12:17.062 --> 02:12:18.664
YOU LOOK AT THE CHART ON THE

02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:25.304
THIRD PAGE. ACTUALLY JUNE TO NOVEMBER PERIOD IN A

02:12:25.370 --> 02:12:27.306
BELOW NORMAL YEAR

02:12:27.372 --> 02:12:28.940
AND SO ACCORDING TO THE PETITION

02:12:29.007 --> 02:12:30.142
BEING PRESENTED AT THE WATER

02:12:30.208 --> 02:12:31.810
BOARD THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE

02:12:31.877 --> 02:12:33.545
OF RIGHT NOW. THERE IS NO

02:12:33.612 --> 02:12:35.347
OPERATIONAL PLAN THAT SAYS WE

02:12:35.414 --> 02:12:37.683
ONLY DIVERT DURING HIGH FLOWS

02:12:37.749 --> 02:12:39.084
AND SO THIS IS VERY CONCERNING

02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:40.652
WITH RESPECT TO THE FISH WITH

02:12:40.719 --> 02:12:42.354
RESPECT TO THE OTHER WATER USERS

02:12:42.421 --> 02:12:44.423
IN THE AREA. AND THEN ALSO WITH

02:12:44.489 --> 02:12:46.224
RESPECT TO HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS

02:12:46.291 --> 02:12:47.726
WHICH IS AN INCREASING CONCERN

02:12:47.793 --> 02:12:48.327
AS.

02:12:48.393 --> 02:12:51.029
TEMPERATURES WARM I WARM AND

02:12:51.096 --> 02:12:52.764
AND AND THOSE MUNICIPAL WATER

02:12:52.831 --> 02:12:54.299
SUPPLIES THAT ARE IMPACTED ARE

02:12:54.366 --> 02:12:56.068
OFTEN WILL THOSE LEAST ABLE TO

02:12:56.134 --> 02:12:57.369
PAY AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

02:12:57.436 --> 02:12:59.004
COMMUNITIES SUCH AS STOCKTON IN

02:12:59.071 --> 02:13:01.273
ANTIOCH IN PARTICULAR. I'M AND

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:02.274
I'VE HEARD THE GROUNDWATER

02:13:02.341 --> 02:13:03.942
MENTIONED AS WELL BUT I THINK

02:13:04.009 --> 02:13:05.277
IT'S BEEN PART OF THE WATER

02:13:05.344 --> 02:13:07.045
BOARD PROCEEDING WE'VE SHOWN

02:13:07.112 --> 02:13:08.347
THAT GROUND WATER LEVELS IN THE

02:13:08.413 --> 02:13:09.247
VICINITY.

02:13:09.314 --> 02:13:11.350
IN SACRAMENTO IN THE EAST

02:13:11.416 --> 02:13:14.186
AMERICAN SUBBASIN SOUTH AMERICAN

02:13:14.252 --> 02:13:14.920
SUBBASIN AS WELL AS THE SAN

02:13:14.986 --> 02:13:16.922
JOAQUIN SUBBASIN ARE IMPACTED BY

02:13:16.988 --> 02:13:18.290
THE DIVERSIONS OF WATER BECAUSE.

02:13:18.357 --> 02:13:19.891
SO MUCH WATER WOULD BE TAKEN OUT

02:13:19.958 --> 02:13:21.326
THAT THE WATER LEVEL IN THE

02:13:21.393 --> 02:13:23.195
RIVER LITERALLY GOES DOWN.

02:13:23.261 --> 02:13:24.196
SO.

02:13:24.262 --> 02:13:25.964
I AM.

02:13:26.031 --> 02:13:28.400
WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ALSO THAT

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:29.735
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONDITIONAL

02:13:29.801 --> 02:13:31.203
SUPPORT FOR INSTANCE FOR THE

02:13:31.269 --> 02:13:33.138
TUNNELS FROM PETER MORE OIL BUT

02:13:33.205 --> 02:13:34.639
BUT THE BUT THE U. SIDEBOARDS HE

02:13:34.706 --> 02:13:36.375
PUT AROUND THAT NEVER REALLY GET

02:13:36.441 --> 02:13:38.043
DISCUSSED. THE SCREENING

02:13:38.110 --> 02:13:39.177
TECHNOLOGY.

02:13:39.244 --> 02:13:40.512
IS IS VERY.

02:13:40.579 --> 02:13:42.714
IS NOT DEVELOPED.

02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:44.716
ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT IS RELIED

02:13:44.783 --> 02:13:46.618
UPON FOR THE FUTURE WHICH WE

02:13:46.685 --> 02:13:47.919
DON'T KNOW HOW IT WOULD BE

02:13:47.986 --> 02:13:49.121
MANAGED THERE'S A HUGE RANGE OF

02:13:49.187 --> 02:13:51.456
OPERATIONS THAT ARE POSSIBLE AND

02:13:51.523 --> 02:13:52.124
THE CONTRACTORS AND YOU HAVE YOU

02:13:52.190 --> 02:13:54.326
ARE. ARE JUST SAYING WE'LL TAKE

02:13:54.393 --> 02:13:55.660
CARE ABOUT DON'T WORRY.

02:13:55.727 --> 02:13:58.096
SO AND THEN YOU KNOW THERE'S

02:13:58.163 --> 02:14:00.132
BEEN NO DUE DILIGENCE ON

02:14:00.198 --> 02:14:01.433
CARRYING OUT THE RESTORATION

02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:02.801
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP FISH

02:14:02.868 --> 02:14:04.336
EVEN BACK FROM THE TEN YEARS OLD

02:14:04.403 --> 02:14:06.037
BIOLOGICAL OPINION SO THERE'S

02:14:06.104 --> 02:14:07.072
JUST NOT A GOOD TRACK RECORD

02:14:07.139 --> 02:14:09.307
HERE. FOR DOING THE THINGS THAT

02:14:09.374 --> 02:14:10.876
THAT THESE FOLKS SAY THEY WILL

02:14:10.942 --> 02:14:13.311
DO SO WE'VE GOT SEVERE RATE

02:14:13.378 --> 02:14:15.347
PAYER RISKING TAXPAYER RISK

02:14:15.414 --> 02:14:17.215
GOING ON WE'VE GOT FUNDS

02:14:17.282 --> 02:14:18.750
DIVERTED FROM OTHER INVESTMENTS

02:14:18.817 --> 02:14:20.519
THAT WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO

02:14:20.585 --> 02:14:22.621
PROVIDE WATER. AND THEN WE'VE

02:14:22.687 --> 02:14:24.890
GOT IT BECAUSE OF THE SUM COST

02:14:24.956 --> 02:14:26.124
IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S BEING

02:14:26.191 --> 02:14:27.893
PROPOSED EVEN MORE PRESSURE TO

02:14:27.959 --> 02:14:29.394
DIVERT WATER FROM THE DELTA THAT

02:14:29.461 --> 02:14:30.996
WE ALREADY HAVE. SO S.

02:14:31.062 --> 02:14:32.731
SUPERVISOR NATOLI MENTIONED WE

02:14:32.798 --> 02:14:34.399
NEED TO WORK ON THE LEVEES THERE

02:14:34.466 --> 02:14:35.267
AS THEY.

02:14:35.333 --> 02:14:36.835
DELTA PROTECTION COMMISSION HAS

02:14:36.902 --> 02:14:37.969
ESTIMATED THAT THAT'S A ONE TO

02:14:38.036 --> 02:14:39.271
TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT

02:14:39.337 --> 02:14:40.405
PROBABLY.

02:14:40.472 --> 02:14:42.174
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE CHANGES TO

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:43.542
THE EXISTING PUMPS THAT ARE

02:14:43.608 --> 02:14:44.976
ALREADY REQUIRED.

02:14:45.043 --> 02:14:47.345
BY THE A BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS IN

02:14:47.412 --> 02:14:49.114
THAT PETER MOYAL IN HIS WHITE

02:14:49.181 --> 02:14:52.250
PAPER ALSO SAYS SHOULD BE DONE.

02:14:52.317 --> 02:14:55.287
AND AM THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES

02:14:55.353 --> 02:14:57.589
OF POSSIBLE OTHER DIVERSIONS

02:14:57.656 --> 02:14:58.523
MAYBE IN THE WEST OUT OF FOR

02:14:58.590 --> 02:14:59.858
HIGH FLOWS WE HAVEN'T HAD A

02:14:59.925 --> 02:15:01.226
CHANCE TO LOOK AT THOSE ALL THE

02:15:01.293 --> 02:15:03.061
MONEY'S BEEN SPENT ON THIS ONE

02:15:03.128 --> 02:15:04.596
PARTICULAR OPTION.

02:15:04.663 --> 02:15:06.264
OR THE SUITE OF OPTIONS AROUND

02:15:06.331 --> 02:15:08.500
IT SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE

02:15:08.567 --> 02:15:10.435
CAN DO AND AND I WOULD ASK THAT

02:15:10.502 --> 02:15:12.471
THE LEGISLATURE DOES EXERCISE

02:15:12.537 --> 02:15:14.206
CONTINUING OVERSIGHT OVER THIS

02:15:14.272 --> 02:15:16.274
PROCESS YOUR HELP IS NEEDED TO

02:15:16.341 --> 02:15:17.742
GET THIS ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND

02:15:17.809 --> 02:15:18.710
TO GET US TOWARD THE KIND OF

02:15:18.777 --> 02:15:20.312
SOLUTIONS. THAT WE CAN HAVE A

02:15:20.378 --> 02:15:21.913
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT AND

02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:23.582
THIS IS THAT THE VISIT PROJECT

02:15:23.648 --> 02:15:26.551
PROP PROJECT THAT WILL JUST

02:15:26.618 --> 02:15:26.985
DIVIDE CALIFORNIA.

02:15:27.052 --> 02:15:28.286
AND THERE IS THE STATE WATER

02:15:28.353 --> 02:15:30.021
CONTRACTOR AMENDMENT PROSPECTS

02:15:30.088 --> 02:15:32.123
THAT'S UNDER WAY NOW AND THAT

02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:34.059
DOES REQUIRE A LOOK AT HEARING

02:15:34.125 --> 02:15:35.160
HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE.

02:15:35.227 --> 02:15:37.496
TO INFORM REGARDING.

02:15:37.562 --> 02:15:39.698
THE AMENDMENTS AND IN ADDITION

02:15:39.764 --> 02:15:41.433
A WATER COULD SECTION ONE FORTY

02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:43.702
SEVEN REQUIRES ANNUAL REPORTING

02:15:43.768 --> 02:15:44.903
TO THIS BODY.

02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:47.205
REGARDING THE BUDGET OF THE

02:15:47.272 --> 02:15:48.974
WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT AND

02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:50.642
THAT ANNUAL REPORTING SHOULD BE

02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:52.143
REQUIRED AS PART OF ANY.

02:15:52.210 --> 02:15:54.579
HEARING THAT IS HELD IN

02:15:54.646 --> 02:15:55.013
OVERSIGHT.

02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:57.249
SO BECAUSE ESPECIALLY WITH

02:15:57.315 --> 02:15:58.617
ORVILLE CRISIS AND THE FED

02:15:58.683 --> 02:16:00.619
SAYING THEY MAY NOT PAY BECAUSE

02:16:00.685 --> 02:16:02.387
THE STATE WATER PROJECT FAILED

02:16:02.454 --> 02:16:04.990
TO MAINTAIN. AS THEY SHOULD HAVE

02:16:05.056 --> 02:16:06.725
THEY REALLY THE LEGISLATURE

02:16:06.791 --> 02:16:08.760
NEEDS TO HAVE MORE OVERSIGHT

02:16:08.827 --> 02:16:09.995
OVER THE STATE WATER PROJECT NOT

02:16:10.061 --> 02:16:10.795
LESS

02:16:10.862 --> 02:16:13.398
SO ALONG III ARE A LONG PROCESS

02:16:13.465 --> 02:16:14.900
AND A LONG LIST OF MITIGATION

02:16:14.966 --> 02:16:16.034
MEASURES THAT ARE LARGELY

02:16:16.101 --> 02:16:17.335
UNENFORCEABLE.

02:16:17.402 --> 02:16:18.370
DOES NOT MAKE THIS A GOOD

02:16:18.436 --> 02:16:19.671
PROJECT

02:16:19.738 --> 02:16:20.272

I THINK YOU'VE SEEN

02:16:21.373 --> 02:16:23.108
UNPRECEDENTED WAVE OF AT EVERY

02:16:23.174 --> 02:16:24.409
LEVEL ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM THE

02:16:24.476 --> 02:16:25.477
LOCALS ALL THE WAY UP TO

02:16:25.544 --> 02:16:26.344
INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL

02:16:26.411 --> 02:16:27.879
GROUPS AND OTHERS WHO ARE

02:16:27.946 --> 02:16:29.247

WE SHOULD PURSUE OTHER OPTIONS

02:16:35.687 --> 02:16:38.690
PLEASE HELP US.

.

02:16:44.329 --> 02:16:45.497
THIS WOULD OPEN UP BUT JUST

02:16:45.564 --> 02:16:46.131
MISTER CUDDLING HER BUT WHAT DO

02:16:46.197 --> 02:16:47.432

02:16:47.499 --> 02:16:48.900
TO MW DIS DECISION TO COVER

02:16:48.967 --> 02:16:50.702
MORE THE PROJECT AND HOW DO YOU

02:16:50.769 --> 02:16:52.237
PLAN TO MITIGATE THOSE RISKS.

02:16:52.304 --> 02:16:53.838
SO ARE AMONG THE RISKS IN ANY

02:16:53.905 --> 02:16:55.874
LARGE PROJECT TO COURSES PROJECT

02:16:55.941 --> 02:16:57.442
MANAGEMENT CONSTRUCTION DELIVERY

02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:58.977
THERE'S ALWAYS ISSUES PROTECT IT

02:16:59.044 --> 02:16:59.945
WHEN YOU GET INTO TUNNELING WHEN

02:17:00.011 --> 02:17:00.912
YOU GET INTO THE GROUND. A

02:17:00.979 --> 02:17:02.414
METROPOLITAN HAS A GOOD TRACK

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:04.716
RECORD AYE IN NINETEEN NINETY

02:17:04.783 --> 02:17:07.152
NINE WE COMPLETED BUILDING A TWO

02:17:07.218 --> 02:17:08.119
POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR

02:17:08.186 --> 02:17:09.387
RESERVOIR THE LARGEST RESERVOIR

02:17:09.454 --> 02:17:10.555
BUILT IN CALIFORNIA SINCE

02:17:10.622 --> 02:17:12.691
NINETEEN SIXTY. WE DID ON TIME

02:17:12.757 --> 02:17:14.025
AND ON BUDGET.

02:17:14.092 --> 02:17:15.660
WE ALSO THEN CONNECTED IT WITH

02:17:15.727 --> 02:17:17.896
THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR

02:17:17.963 --> 02:17:20.665
TUNNEL PROJECT. IT WAS NOT ON

02:17:20.732 --> 02:17:21.700
TIME IT RAN INTO THE PLACE WE

02:17:21.766 --> 02:17:23.368
RAN NTO A VERY DIFFICULT.

02:17:23.435 --> 02:17:25.337
GROUND BUT WE ALSO DELIVERED IT

02:17:25.403 --> 02:17:26.171
ON BUDGET.

02:17:26.237 --> 02:17:28.006
AND SO WE DID MANAGE TO DO THAT

02:17:28.073 --> 02:17:30.742
ON BUDGET. COUPLE YEARS TO LIFE.

02:17:30.809 --> 02:17:32.644
WE'VE ALSO A DONE OVER A ONE

02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:34.079
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR

02:17:34.145 --> 02:17:36.081
RETROFIT OF ALL THE TREATMENT

02:17:36.147 --> 02:17:37.282
FACILITIES IN SOUTHERN

02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:39.417
CALIFORNIA MOVING IT TO OZONE

02:17:39.484 --> 02:17:40.085
TREATMENT

02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:41.186
WE'VE DONE THAT ON BUDGET AS

02:17:41.252 --> 02:17:42.854
WELL. SO WE KNOW HOW TO MANAGE

02:17:42.921 --> 02:17:44.122
LARGE SCALE PROJECTS AND WE KNOW

02:17:44.189 --> 02:17:45.957
HOW TO DO THIS. THAT WE THINK IS

02:17:46.024 --> 02:17:47.125
THE STRENGTH OF THIS JPA

02:17:47.192 --> 02:17:48.393
APPROACH WE'RE BRINGING IN

02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:50.595
EXPERTISE OF AGENCIES LIKE MINE

02:17:50.662 --> 02:17:52.297
THAT BUILD LARGE PROJECTS AND

02:17:52.364 --> 02:17:53.965
PUT THEM AND TO MARRY WITH THE

02:17:54.032 --> 02:17:56.001
W. OURS AUTHORITY. AND TO MAKE

02:17:56.067 --> 02:17:57.602
SURE WE CAN DELIVER THIS ON TIME

02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:59.037
AND ON BUDGET.

02:17:59.104 --> 02:18:00.005
IT JUST SEEMS OVER YOU IF YOU'VE

02:18:00.071 --> 02:18:01.806
DOUBLED THAT THE AMOUNT YOU'RE

02:18:01.873 --> 02:18:03.642
WILLING TO PAY.

02:18:03.708 --> 02:18:04.209
YOU HAVE TO MITIGATE THAT IN

02:18:04.275 --> 02:18:05.343
SOME KIND OF WAY.

02:18:05.410 --> 02:18:06.711
WELL RIGHT NOW WE'RE ALREADY

02:18:06.778 --> 02:18:08.279
TALKING TO AGENCIES THAT WOULD

02:18:08.346 --> 02:18:10.148
BE OF MOVING WATER THROUGH THAT

02:18:10.215 --> 02:18:11.583
CAPACITY SO WE WOULD HAVE THE

02:18:11.650 --> 02:18:14.019
ABILITY TO. A MOVE WATER THROUGH

02:18:14.085 --> 02:18:15.520
THAT CAPACITY AND THEN BRENT

02:18:15.587 --> 02:18:17.656
THAT OUT OR WE'LL WATER IN OTHER

02:18:17.722 --> 02:18:19.090
WORDS PEOPLE COULD MOVE THAT.

02:18:19.157 --> 02:18:20.625
YOU'VE SECOND PASS CITY AND A

02:18:20.692 --> 02:18:22.160
CLIMATE CHANGE WORLD WE EXPECT

02:18:22.227 --> 02:18:22.961
THERE'S GOING TO BE PLENTY OF

02:18:23.028 --> 02:18:25.196
PEOPLE OF SANTA CLARA BY THEIR

02:18:25.263 --> 02:18:26.264
ACTION THE OTHER DAY.

02:18:26.331 --> 02:18:28.366
PUT TOGETHER AN OPTION THAT

02:18:28.433 --> 02:18:29.768
THEIR BOARD OF AUTHORIZED TO GO

02:18:29.834 --> 02:18:31.503
UP EFFECTIVELY PURCHASED TWO

02:18:31.569 --> 02:18:33.071
HUNDRED CUBIC FEET PER SECOND OF

02:18:33.138 --> 02:18:34.439
THAT THREE THOUSAND THAT WE

02:18:34.506 --> 02:18:35.707
WOULD BE FINANCING. AND WE

02:18:35.774 --> 02:18:36.775
EXPECT THE REST OF CENTRAL

02:18:36.841 --> 02:18:38.343
VALLEY AND OTHER PARTNERS TO DO

02:18:38.410 --> 02:18:39.811
THAT AS WELL.

02:18:39.878 --> 02:18:40.945
IT WAS ALWAYS EARLIER YOU BANK

02:18:41.012 --> 02:18:44.849
IT THEY BUY IT UPSET THE CONCEPT.

02:18:44.916 --> 02:18:47.118
BANK IT A WINK WHAT YOU KNOW WE

02:18:47.185 --> 02:18:47.752
WOULD NOT ACTUALLY BE MOVING

02:18:47.819 --> 02:18:48.386
WATER SOUTH BECAUSE IT'S THEIR

02:18:48.453 --> 02:18:49.621
WATER THEY WOULD BE CONTRACTING

02:18:49.688 --> 02:18:51.389
WITH US FOR US TO MOVE IT FOR

02:18:51.456 --> 02:18:52.223
THEM.

02:18:52.290 --> 02:18:54.392
ACT.

02:18:54.459 --> 02:18:56.161
CAN YOU TALK WITH THE GPAS AND

02:18:56.227 --> 02:18:58.229
HOW DO YOU SEE.

02:18:58.296 --> 02:18:59.864
THE PUBLIC HAVING INPUT INTO AND

02:18:59.931 --> 02:19:00.965
AND THIS BODY HAVING INPUT AND

02:19:01.032 --> 02:19:02.600
OVERSEEING US.

02:19:02.667 --> 02:19:03.935
ABSOLUTELY I THESE JP IS WOULD

02:19:04.002 --> 02:19:05.603
BE PUBLIC BODIES JP'S ARE PRETTY

02:19:05.670 --> 02:19:07.005
COMMON IN DELIVERING LARGE SCALE

02:19:07.072 --> 02:19:08.506
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THE GOLD

02:19:08.573 --> 02:19:10.041
LINE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOST

02:19:10.108 --> 02:19:11.943
OF OUR LIGHT RAIL PROJECTS HAVE

02:19:12.010 --> 02:19:13.812
HAD STANDALONE JP HAS THAT HAVE

02:19:13.878 --> 02:19:15.947
A. GOOD OVERSEEING THE DESIGN

02:19:16.014 --> 02:19:17.348
AND CONSTRUCTION OF THEM THEY

02:19:17.415 --> 02:19:19.050
ARE PUBLIC AGENCIES THEY MEET

02:19:19.117 --> 02:19:20.251
THEY ARE MADE UP A PUBLIC AGENCY

02:19:20.318 --> 02:19:22.020
REPRESENTATIVES THING IS SUBJECT

02:19:22.087 --> 02:19:23.655
TO THE BROWN ACT OF THE U. CAMP

02:19:23.722 --> 02:19:24.956
PUBLIC COMMENT. THAT WOULD HAVE

02:19:25.023 --> 02:19:26.925
A PUBLIC WEBSITE OLDER SPENDING

02:19:26.991 --> 02:19:28.393
AGENDAS EVERYTHING WOULD BE

02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:30.462
POSTED AND AVAILABLE AND THE

02:19:30.528 --> 02:19:32.731
COURSE OF THIS LEGISLATURE AS

02:19:32.797 --> 02:19:34.232
ANY PUBLIC AGENCIES FORM COULD

02:19:34.299 --> 02:19:37.001
ALWAYS I HAVE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS

02:19:37.068 --> 02:19:38.403
AND AND REVIEW THE PROCESS.

02:19:38.470 --> 02:19:42.440
I'M.

02:19:42.507 --> 02:19:43.508
WE'RE GOING WE TALK ABOUT THE.

02:19:43.575 --> 02:19:46.311
DELTA DEDUCTIBLES OF MAINTAIN

02:19:46.377 --> 02:19:49.948
THE DELTA WATER CONVEYANCE I'M.

02:19:50.014 --> 02:19:51.583
DOES THIS PLACE CAN YOU. WATCH

02:19:51.649 --> 02:19:53.051
IT WITH THIS PROJECT WE'RE

02:19:53.118 --> 02:19:54.586
TALKING ABOUT AND AND I AND I

02:19:54.652 --> 02:19:55.553
HAVE SAID THIS MULTIPLE TIMES

02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:56.755
WERE JUST FOCUSING ON ONE

02:19:56.821 --> 02:19:58.022
PROJECT WITHOUT LOOKING AT

02:19:58.089 --> 02:19:59.324
WESTERN INTAKES WITHOUT LOOKING

02:19:59.390 --> 02:20:01.126
AT DIFFERENT ALTERNATE WITHOUT

02:20:01.192 --> 02:20:01.693
LOOKING AT STRENGTHENING OUR

02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:03.061
LEVEES WITHOUT. LOOKING AT

02:20:03.128 --> 02:20:04.395
ANYTHING ELSE SO THAT'S A LOT OF

02:20:04.462 --> 02:20:05.964
MONEY NOT GOING TOWARDS A LOT OF

02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:07.866
TENSION NOT GOING TOWARDS IT

02:20:07.932 --> 02:20:10.101
THREE CO EQUAL GOALS.

02:20:10.168 --> 02:20:11.336
I MEAN HOW DO YOU I'M JUST VERY

02:20:11.402 --> 02:20:12.771
SPECIFICALLY OR OR GENERALLY HOW

02:20:12.837 --> 02:20:14.172
DO YOU SEE THAT THE CO EQUAL

02:20:14.239 --> 02:20:15.874
GOALS.

02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:17.342
BEING ADDRESSED THROUGH THIS

02:20:17.408 --> 02:20:18.443
PROJECT.

02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:23.915
IF YOU DO IT ALL.

02:20:23.982 --> 02:20:24.716
YEAH BUT WHAT ABOUT START AM. I

02:20:24.783 --> 02:20:25.784
MEAN I THINK.

02:20:25.850 --> 02:20:27.685
WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY WE

02:20:27.752 --> 02:20:28.820
DON'T THINK IT MAKES THE

02:20:28.887 --> 02:20:31.089
SUPPLIES MORE RELIABLE I'M FOR

02:20:31.156 --> 02:20:32.190
ANYONE.

02:20:32.257 --> 02:20:34.425
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS

02:20:34.492 --> 02:20:36.227
PROJECT CAN EVEN BE BUILT ON

02:20:36.294 --> 02:20:37.929
TIME IT'S A MEGA PROJECT AND

02:20:37.996 --> 02:20:39.597
WE'RE AT TEN PERCENT DESIGNED

02:20:39.664 --> 02:20:41.099
SUPPOSEDLY THERE WERE IN THE

02:20:41.166 --> 02:20:42.467
MIDDLE OF A WATER RIGHTS HEARING

02:20:42.534 --> 02:20:43.735
AND THE PROJECT HAS ALREADY

02:20:43.802 --> 02:20:45.603
CHANGED SO MANY TIMES THAT WE

02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:47.338
ARE APPARENTLY DELAYED IN. AYE

02:20:47.405 --> 02:20:48.840
PREPARING REBUTTAL BECAUSE WE

02:20:48.907 --> 02:20:50.275
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROJECT IS

02:20:50.341 --> 02:20:51.476
RIGHT NOW.

02:20:51.543 --> 02:20:53.011
SO IF THERE ISN'T A LOT OF

02:20:53.077 --> 02:20:54.813
CERTAINTY AROUND THE PROJECT AT

02:20:54.879 --> 02:20:56.281
ALL AND.

02:20:56.347 --> 02:20:58.049
SO IN TERMS OF WATER SUPPLY

02:20:58.116 --> 02:20:59.984
RELIABILITY WE THINK THAT THE

02:21:00.051 --> 02:21:02.187
OTHER OPTIONS THAT AGENCIES CAN

02:21:02.253 --> 02:21:04.222
AND DO. UP PUT ATTENTION ON

02:21:04.289 --> 02:21:05.690
SHOULD HAVE THIS KIND OF

02:21:05.757 --> 02:21:07.892
RESOURCES PUT BEHIND THAT AND

02:21:07.959 --> 02:21:09.093
THAT COULD SUPPLY. LEVEL

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:10.595
RELIABILITY.

02:21:10.662 --> 02:21:12.363
AND IN TERMS OF RESTORATION

02:21:12.430 --> 02:21:13.898
WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT.

02:21:13.965 --> 02:21:16.701
MORE NATURAL FLOW PATTERNS I

02:21:16.768 --> 02:21:18.269
WAS PLEASE DIRECTOR NEMETH IS A

02:21:18.336 --> 02:21:19.604
LIMITED HER REMARKS TO THE SOUTH

02:21:19.671 --> 02:21:21.906
DELTA WHICH MAY BE TRUE BUT IN

02:21:21.973 --> 02:21:23.775
THE NORTH DELTA. IT THIS IS

02:21:23.842 --> 02:21:25.343
GOING TO LITERALLY RUN THE RIVER

02:21:25.410 --> 02:21:26.477
BACKWARDS UNDER CERTAIN

02:21:26.544 --> 02:21:28.112
CONDITIONS IN EAST BAY MAD AND

02:21:28.179 --> 02:21:29.714
OTHERS WITH OTHER LARGE INTAKES

02:21:29.781 --> 02:21:30.648
IN THE AREA THAT AREN'T NEARLY

02:21:30.715 --> 02:21:32.116
AS LARGE BUT THERE ARE VERY

02:21:32.183 --> 02:21:33.685
CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF

02:21:33.751 --> 02:21:35.720
THAT. AND THEN IN TERMS OF WHAT

02:21:35.787 --> 02:21:37.622
WAS NEGOTIATED TO BE THE THIRD

02:21:37.689 --> 02:21:39.557
LEG OF THE STOOL. THE DELTA AS A

02:21:39.624 --> 02:21:40.758
PLACE.

02:21:40.825 --> 02:21:43.194
IT IT JUST GETS TRASHED I MEAN.

02:21:43.261 --> 02:21:45.063
AND AND A JPA I MEAN SANTA CLARA

02:21:45.129 --> 02:21:46.664
VOTED YESTERDAY TO HAVE SOME

02:21:46.731 --> 02:21:48.233
KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE

02:21:48.299 --> 02:21:49.701
WHICH IS TOTALLY UNDEFINED THAT

02:21:49.767 --> 02:21:51.069
WOULD APPARENTLY PROVIDE SOME

02:21:51.135 --> 02:21:52.937
OVERSIGHT IN ADDITION TO. THE

02:21:53.004 --> 02:21:55.206
ALREADY EXISTING MITIGATION

02:21:55.273 --> 02:21:56.107
MEASURES THAT YOU HEARD MISS

02:21:56.174 --> 02:21:57.909
PEER AND OTHERS HAVE REFERRED TO

02:21:57.976 --> 02:21:59.010
BUT I MEAN THERE'S NO MEAT TO

02:21:59.077 --> 02:22:00.311
ANY OF THIS IN ON THE WATER

02:22:00.378 --> 02:22:02.680
QUALITY SIDE FOR IN DELTA. MOST

02:22:02.747 --> 02:22:04.282
OF THE MITIGATION SAYS THEY WILL

02:22:04.349 --> 02:22:06.451
WORK WITH THESE COMMUNITIES AND

02:22:06.518 --> 02:22:08.853
MUNICIPALITIES TO TRY TO FIGURE

02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:10.221
OUT WAYS TO ADDRESS.

02:22:10.288 --> 02:22:11.556
THE WATER QUALITY THEY DON'T

02:22:11.623 --> 02:22:13.291
COMMIT TO PROVIDING REPLACEMENT

02:22:13.358 --> 02:22:15.026
SUPPLIES OR BROUGHT PROVIDING

02:22:15.093 --> 02:22:16.694
THE INCREASED COST OF TREATMENT

02:22:16.761 --> 02:22:17.695
FOR BROMIDE AND.

02:22:17.762 --> 02:22:19.297
SALT SALT SO WE JUST DON'T SEE

02:22:19.364 --> 02:22:21.466
IT.

02:22:21.532 --> 02:22:22.600
AND WHO DO YOU THINK HAS THE

02:22:22.667 --> 02:22:24.369
POWER TO CONTROL THE FLOWS AND

02:22:24.435 --> 02:22:26.070
WITH THEM DIABETES. DECISION I

02:22:26.137 --> 02:22:27.772
MEAN.

02:22:27.839 --> 02:22:29.340
AND SO AND I KEEP COMING BACK TO

02:22:29.407 --> 02:22:30.675
THIS ISSUE OF.

02:22:30.742 --> 02:22:32.443
YOU'RE GONNA PAY A LOT MORE

02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:33.711
MONEY TO BE ABLE TO. COMMIT TO

02:22:33.778 --> 02:22:35.346
PROVIDE MORE WATER YOU CAN TALK

02:22:35.413 --> 02:22:37.015
ABOUT IT SOLID OR WHATEVER BUT.

02:22:37.081 --> 02:22:38.549
THERE IS UP THERE IS A

02:22:38.616 --> 02:22:40.652
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO NOT DO

02:22:40.718 --> 02:22:41.953
THAT KIND OF.

02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:44.923
RECYCLING RECLAMATION AND AND

02:22:44.989 --> 02:22:46.858
OTHER THINGS IF WE ARE.

02:22:46.925 --> 02:22:48.693
FULLY INVESTED IN IT IN THIS

02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:50.161
THEN THERE HAS TO BE SOME KIND

02:22:50.228 --> 02:22:51.262
OF WAY TO EVEN IT OUT FOR FOR

02:22:51.329 --> 02:22:52.897
REPAIRS.

02:22:52.964 --> 02:22:54.232
YEAH AND I THINK IT'S SORT OF

02:22:54.299 --> 02:22:55.500
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT

02:22:55.566 --> 02:22:57.068
THE EXISTING SYSTEM TO LOOK AT

02:22:57.135 --> 02:22:59.237
HOW MUCH PRESSURE GETS PUT ON

02:22:59.304 --> 02:23:01.472
THE EXISTING SYSTEM TO EXPORT.

02:23:01.539 --> 02:23:03.641
WHEN WARREN DROUGHT LOOK AT THE

02:23:03.708 --> 02:23:05.610
WORD A BILL THAT YOU KNOW CHANGE

02:23:05.677 --> 02:23:07.378
THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION

02:23:07.445 --> 02:23:08.513
OF SPECIES SO THERE'S A

02:23:08.579 --> 02:23:09.814
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE

02:23:09.881 --> 02:23:12.350
ALREADY. AND I THINK IF THERE'S

02:23:12.417 --> 02:23:13.885
BILLIONS MORE INVESTED.

02:23:13.952 --> 02:23:16.354
AND BON PAIRS BEHIND NOT TRYING

02:23:16.421 --> 02:23:18.423
TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN MAKE MONEY

02:23:18.489 --> 02:23:20.191
ON THEIR INVESTMENT. THEN YOU

02:23:20.258 --> 02:23:21.459
KNOW IT REALLY GIVES US

02:23:21.526 --> 02:23:23.728
CONCERNED ABOUT WATER BECOMING

02:23:23.795 --> 02:23:26.397
MORE OF A PRIVATIZED ASSET WHERE

02:23:26.464 --> 02:23:27.932
THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN FISH AND

02:23:27.999 --> 02:23:29.534
WILDLIFE ARE EVEN FARTHER DOWN

02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:32.737
THE FOOD CHAIN.

02:23:32.804 --> 02:23:35.139
M. THANK YOU AND AND THE.

02:23:35.206 --> 02:23:36.574
SUPERVISOR NATOLI WHAT DO YOU

02:23:36.641 --> 02:23:38.009
THINK ARE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:23:38.076 --> 02:23:40.111
A AND RESIDENTS MOST SERIOUS

02:23:40.178 --> 02:23:42.080
CONCERNS.

02:23:42.146 --> 02:23:43.481
I THINK I'M THE LONG TERM

02:23:43.548 --> 02:23:44.983
DEGRADATION TO THE DELTA A AS I

02:23:45.049 --> 02:23:46.351
MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS AND I

02:23:46.417 --> 02:23:48.486
WILL BE REPETITIVE BUT. ALL YOU

02:23:48.553 --> 02:23:49.454
HAVE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE

02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:50.722
SETTLED THE SAME TIME THE STATE

02:23:50.788 --> 02:23:53.625
WAS SETTLED AND. OF FOLKS HAVE A

02:23:53.691 --> 02:23:54.092
A MAJOR.

02:23:54.158 --> 02:23:56.594
LIVELIHOODS AND LIVES IN THE

02:23:56.661 --> 02:23:57.528
DELTA COMMUNITIES AND SOME OF

02:23:57.595 --> 02:23:58.663
THOSE HAVE GROWN AND PROSPERED

02:23:58.730 --> 02:23:59.163
ALONG WITH THE STATE OF

02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:01.666
CALIFORNIA WATER RISK IS KEYED

02:24:01.733 --> 02:24:02.800
ALL THAT'S AN ACUTE OTHER

02:24:02.867 --> 02:24:04.435
REGIONS THE STATE WE RECOGNIZE

02:24:04.502 --> 02:24:06.337
THAT. BUT I THINK THAT THE SONY

02:24:06.404 --> 02:24:08.006
THE CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS A BUILD

02:24:08.072 --> 02:24:09.707
ME COMPRISES TEMPORAL BUT IN MY

02:24:09.774 --> 02:24:11.542
VIEW TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS IS

02:24:11.609 --> 02:24:14.779
NOT TEMPORARY THAT NET POINT

02:24:14.846 --> 02:24:15.513
TIME YOU CAN HAVE.

02:24:15.580 --> 02:24:16.180
SMALL BUSINESSES COLLAPSE COULD

02:24:16.247 --> 02:24:17.815
HAVE DISRUPTION TO THE ECONOMIC

02:24:17.882 --> 02:24:19.150
ACTIVITIES RELEASED A FARMING

02:24:19.217 --> 02:24:20.885
INTO ALL THE RELATED. ACTIVITIES

02:24:20.952 --> 02:24:21.886
GO WITH THAT.

02:24:21.953 --> 02:24:23.788
I THINK WE RUN THE RISK ALONG

02:24:23.855 --> 02:24:25.023
WITH OTHER.

02:24:25.089 --> 02:24:26.791
YEAH UNIX A COME DOWN RELATIVE

02:24:26.858 --> 02:24:27.692
TO.

02:24:27.759 --> 02:24:29.460
FLOOD ELEVATIONS INTO

02:24:29.527 --> 02:24:30.895
LEGISLATION COMES THROUGH AS

02:24:30.962 --> 02:24:31.729
RELATES TO.

02:24:31.796 --> 02:24:33.564
LEVY PROTECTIONS ITSELF FOR

02:24:33.631 --> 02:24:35.666
THAT YOU YOU OF FREEZE THOSE

02:24:35.733 --> 02:24:36.834
COMMUNITIES AND TIME AND ALL

02:24:36.901 --> 02:24:38.036
THAT YOU CAN CREATE GHOST TOWNS

02:24:38.102 --> 02:24:39.604
I THINK FOLKS ARE VERY CONCERNED

02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:41.305
THE RECREATIONAL DUST OF

02:24:41.372 --> 02:24:43.975
DISRUPTION. ONE THE WATERWAYS.

02:24:44.042 --> 02:24:46.044
IN IN IN IN IN IN IN CAN VERY

02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:46.310
FRANKLY.

02:24:46.377 --> 02:24:47.845
JOAN EGGMAN.

02:24:47.912 --> 02:24:49.414
I THINK THAT.

02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:51.215
IS OFTEN OVERSTATED IS TO OF

02:24:51.282 --> 02:24:52.617
THE FRAGILITY OF THE DELTA THAT

02:24:52.683 --> 02:24:54.118
YOU KNOW SOMEHOW IF THE.

02:24:54.185 --> 02:24:54.986
YOU KNOW.

02:24:55.053 --> 02:24:57.021
FLOODS IN IT AND SEE LEVEL RISE

02:24:57.088 --> 02:24:58.489
DON'T GET YOU EARTHQUAKES WELL

02:24:58.556 --> 02:24:59.824
THERE IS A RISK IS A RISK IN

02:24:59.891 --> 02:25:01.192
EVERYTHING WE DO AND I THINK

02:25:01.259 --> 02:25:02.493
FOLKS IN THE DELTA OF A

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:04.195
RESILIENT THEY ARE SUPPORTED BY.

02:25:04.262 --> 02:25:05.463
THEIR LARGER BROADER COMMITTEES

02:25:05.530 --> 02:25:06.597
IN THEIR COUNTIES IT CERTAINLY

02:25:06.664 --> 02:25:09.367
IS AS A REASON THE STATE WE

02:25:09.434 --> 02:25:10.468
RECOGNIZE THE CONVEYANCES.

02:25:10.535 --> 02:25:11.869
IMPORTANT AND THAT YOU KNOW WE

02:25:11.936 --> 02:25:13.404
BENEFITTED DEGREE THAT HILL VIA

02:25:13.471 --> 02:25:15.440
IN DELTA SUPPLY ARE RECIPIENTS

02:25:15.506 --> 02:25:16.841
OF A FRESH WATER SUPPLIES IT

02:25:16.908 --> 02:25:17.909
MOVE THROUGH THE THING THAT

02:25:17.975 --> 02:25:19.143
INVESTMENT OUGHT TO BE AND THAT

02:25:19.210 --> 02:25:20.678
LEVY SYSTEM. TO UP DO THAT REYES

02:25:20.745 --> 02:25:21.846
WERE MENTIONED SOME THE OTHER

02:25:21.913 --> 02:25:23.481
TESTIMONY HERE TODAY BUT I THINK

02:25:23.548 --> 02:25:24.949
THE LONG TERM I THINK THERE'S A

02:25:25.016 --> 02:25:26.150
GREAT FEAR AND CRITICALLY

02:25:26.217 --> 02:25:27.785
COMMUNITIES I COULDN'T CORTLAND

02:25:27.852 --> 02:25:29.353
THAT ARE SMALL BEGIN WITH THAT.

02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:31.756
YOU WILL NOT HAVE IT A LONG THAT

02:25:31.823 --> 02:25:32.824
YOU KNOW I SAID EVERLASTING

02:25:32.890 --> 02:25:34.659
AFFECT IT WILL CHANGE THE FACE

02:25:34.725 --> 02:25:35.359
OF THE DELTA NOT JUST THE

02:25:35.426 --> 02:25:37.595
AESTHETIC. BUT I THINK THE THE

02:25:37.662 --> 02:25:39.297
THE THE THE LIFE AS WE KNOW IT

02:25:39.363 --> 02:25:40.731
IT AFFECTED VARMINT WILL AFFECT

02:25:40.798 --> 02:25:42.300
AGRICULTURE AFFECT RECREATION.

02:25:42.366 --> 02:25:44.035
TO ME THAT IS A THAT WOULD BE A

02:25:44.102 --> 02:25:46.003
TREMENDOUS TERRIBLE LOSS I THINK

02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:47.138
IS A FEW WASN'T PURSUED WHISPERS

02:25:47.205 --> 02:25:48.439
THEY HAVE THINKER SO I MEAN TO

02:25:48.506 --> 02:25:52.510
BASICALLY THIS IS GROUP DOES NOT

02:25:52.577 --> 02:25:55.146
MYTHICAL RECALLS.

02:25:55.213 --> 02:25:55.713
YEAH AND ARGUE IT DOES NOT I

02:25:55.780 --> 02:25:56.914
THINK THAT YEAH AS YOU STATED

02:25:56.981 --> 02:25:57.715
EARLIER THE CRITICAL GOALS THAT

02:25:57.782 --> 02:25:58.716
IN AN EMPTY A VERY IMPORTANT

02:25:58.783 --> 02:25:59.317
QUALIFIER IS A LAW THAT YOU

02:25:59.383 --> 02:26:00.184
PROTECT. AND PRESERVE AND

02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:01.986
ENHANCE THE DELTA AS INVOLVING

02:26:02.053 --> 02:26:02.954
PLACE BUT WITH A QUICK

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:06.657
AGRICULTURAL ON HISTORICAL

02:26:06.724 --> 02:26:07.191
RECREATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL

02:26:07.258 --> 02:26:08.459
VALUES.

02:26:08.526 --> 02:26:09.060
I THINK YOU KNOW MISS IS THAT

02:26:09.127 --> 02:26:09.260
MARK.

02:26:09.327 --> 02:26:10.895
TERRIBLY.

02:26:10.962 --> 02:26:12.563
MISTER BUDGET M. WHAT DO YOU SEE

02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:14.098
AS THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN

02:26:14.165 --> 02:26:17.702
OVERSEEING THE GPAS AT THE

02:26:17.768 --> 02:26:18.636
FINANCING CONSTRUCTION OF THAT.

02:26:18.703 --> 02:26:19.770
I THINK THERE'S A VERY IMPORTANT

02:26:19.837 --> 02:26:19.971
ROLE.

02:26:20.037 --> 02:26:22.073
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CONCERNS

02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:24.842
THAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT THE GPAS

02:26:24.909 --> 02:26:26.844
ARE AWAY TO SHIFT LIABILITY AND

02:26:26.911 --> 02:26:28.513
TO A.

02:26:28.579 --> 02:26:30.481
REDUCE OVERSIGHT FROM THE

02:26:30.548 --> 02:26:32.016
ELECTED BODIES OF WATER

02:26:32.083 --> 02:26:34.652
DISTRICTS TO AN UNELECTED JPA.

02:26:34.719 --> 02:26:36.053
AND THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS AS

02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:37.255
WE'VE SEEN WITH OTHER

02:26:37.321 --> 02:26:38.256
INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTAIN BY THE

02:26:38.322 --> 02:26:39.524
STATE WATER PROJECT OF THEIR

02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:40.958
ABILITIES TO ACTUALLY MAINTAIN

02:26:41.025 --> 02:26:41.893
IT PROPERLY AND TO OPERATE

02:26:41.959 --> 02:26:43.227
PROPERLY.

02:26:43.294 --> 02:26:45.596
IN ADDITION THERE IS A

02:26:45.663 --> 02:26:47.365
AGREEMENT ON ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT

02:26:47.431 --> 02:26:49.133
FOR THE WATER FIX THAT WOULD

02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:50.835
ACTUALLY PRIVILEGE THE STATE

02:26:50.902 --> 02:26:52.236
WATER CONTRACTORS.

02:26:52.303 --> 02:26:54.205
BEING IN THE ROOM WITH THE FISH

02:26:54.272 --> 02:26:55.873
AND WILDLIFE AGENCIES DID OF YOU

02:26:55.940 --> 02:26:57.475
ARE IN THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION

02:26:57.542 --> 02:26:59.310
AND NO PUBLIC INTEREST NO

02:26:59.377 --> 02:27:00.878
INTEREST AT THE DELTA. AND SO

02:27:00.945 --> 02:27:02.280
WERE ONCE AGAIN SEEING WHAT

02:27:02.346 --> 02:27:03.381
ALMOST APPEARS TO BE A PAY TO

02:27:03.447 --> 02:27:06.050
PLAY OPPORTUNITY WHERE.

02:27:06.117 --> 02:27:07.885
THOSE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING THE

02:27:07.952 --> 02:27:09.053
PROJECT GET TO HAVE GREATER

02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:10.521
CONTROL NOT JUST OVER THE

02:27:10.588 --> 02:27:11.789
CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT BUT

02:27:11.856 --> 02:27:13.591
THE ITS OPERATIONS.

02:27:13.658 --> 02:27:15.059
YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY I I DO AGREE

02:27:15.126 --> 02:27:16.661
WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THIS

02:27:16.727 --> 02:27:17.962
PROJECT REALLY FAILS A CO EQUAL

02:27:18.029 --> 02:27:20.831
GOALS. IT IT REALLY DOES NOT A

02:27:20.898 --> 02:27:21.399
RESTORE THE HEALTH OF THE

02:27:21.465 --> 02:27:22.900
ESTUARY IT'S GONNA HAVE

02:27:22.967 --> 02:27:24.468
DEVASTATING IMPACTS BOTH DURING

02:27:24.535 --> 02:27:25.870
CONSTRUCTION AND IN THE LONG

02:27:25.937 --> 02:27:27.305
TERM FOR COMMUNITIES IN THE

02:27:27.371 --> 02:27:28.739
DELTA. AND IT DOESN'T REALLY

02:27:28.806 --> 02:27:30.308
IMPROVE WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY

02:27:30.374 --> 02:27:31.375
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S THAT

02:27:31.442 --> 02:27:32.543
REALLY HASN'T BEEN DISCUSSED IS

02:27:32.610 --> 02:27:34.679
THAT. THE STATE WATER PROJECTS

02:27:34.745 --> 02:27:35.313
AT LEAST THE STATE WATER PROJECT

02:27:35.379 --> 02:27:37.114
CONTRACTORS HAVE BEEN INFORMING

02:27:37.181 --> 02:27:39.083
THEM MEMBER AGENCIES THAT THEY

02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:40.351
HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PAY FOR

02:27:40.418 --> 02:27:42.153
THE PROJECT OR TO TRANSFER SOME

02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:44.121
OF THEIR WATER AWAY TO ANOTHER

02:27:44.188 --> 02:27:45.756
CONTRACTOR WHO'S WILLING TO PAY.

02:27:45.823 --> 02:27:47.091
AND WHAT METROPOLITAN HAS BEEN

02:27:47.158 --> 02:27:48.259
REPORTING IS THAT THEY ARE IN

02:27:48.326 --> 02:27:50.061
NEGOTIATIONS WITH KERN COUNTY

02:27:50.127 --> 02:27:51.229
WATER AGENCIES AND OTHER

02:27:51.295 --> 02:27:53.030
CONTRACTORS WHERE WE WOULD SEE

02:27:53.097 --> 02:27:55.166
MET PAY MORE. AN ACT COMMUNITIES

02:27:55.233 --> 02:27:56.901
GET LESS WATER AND ULTIMATELY

02:27:56.968 --> 02:27:58.236
THAT SEEMS REALLY COUNTER

02:27:58.302 --> 02:28:00.504
INTUITIVE TO IMPROVING THE

02:28:00.571 --> 02:28:02.173
RELIABILITY OF WATER SUPPLIES

02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:03.274
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE OPTIONS

02:28:03.341 --> 02:28:04.609
THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO SOUTHERN

02:28:04.675 --> 02:28:05.843
CALIFORNIA AND THE INTEREST FROM

02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:08.246
SAN DIEGO AND LA TO REDUCE

02:28:08.312 --> 02:28:09.513
RELIANCE ON THE DELTA.

02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:10.848
THINK YOU'RE MUCH.

02:28:10.915 --> 02:28:13.017
MISTER BRAZIER.

02:28:13.084 --> 02:28:14.385
THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:17.922
SO.

02:28:17.989 --> 02:28:20.157
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE. POLL ALL

02:28:20.224 --> 02:28:22.093
ASPECTS OF THIS PROJECT. BUT WE

02:28:22.159 --> 02:28:24.061
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IF YOU WERE

02:28:24.128 --> 02:28:25.463
ABLE TO GET NECESSARY. PERMITS

02:28:25.529 --> 02:28:26.831
IF.

02:28:26.897 --> 02:28:29.734
.

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:30.735
THE DETERMINATION ON LAWSUITS

02:28:30.801 --> 02:28:32.703
GOING ON.

02:28:32.770 --> 02:28:33.871
FOR ALL THESE DIFFERENT AGENCIES

02:28:33.938 --> 02:28:36.941
ARE GONNA BE SUING THIS PROJECT.

02:28:37.008 --> 02:28:38.242
THAT TIME FRAME AND THE

02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:39.977
CONSTRUCTION TIME THAT YOU

02:28:40.044 --> 02:28:41.779
ANTICIPATE.

02:28:41.846 --> 02:28:43.080
WHEN YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU COULD

02:28:43.147 --> 02:28:44.982
ACTUALLY PRODUCE ONE DROP OF

02:28:45.049 --> 02:28:48.586
WATER TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:28:48.653 --> 02:28:49.854
ALL PROJECTS TAKE TIME PROTECT

02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:51.622
WATER PROJECTS I MEAN IF WE TOOK

02:28:51.689 --> 02:28:53.691
THE ANALYSIS THAT IT PROJECT

02:28:53.758 --> 02:28:54.892
MIGHT TAKE A DECADE TO DO WE

02:28:54.959 --> 02:28:55.526
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BUILT

02:28:55.593 --> 02:28:57.328
ANYTHING MUCH ABOUT WOULD NEVER

02:28:57.395 --> 02:28:58.329
BUILT THE COLORADO RIVER

02:28:58.396 --> 02:28:59.363
AQUEDUCT IN THE NINETEEN

02:28:59.430 --> 02:29:00.931
THIRTIES. WE WOULD NOT PARTNERED

02:29:00.998 --> 02:29:02.533
WITH GOVERNOR PAT BROWN TO BUILD

02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:03.701
THE STATE WATER PROJECT IN THE

02:29:03.768 --> 02:29:05.670
NINETEEN SIXTIES THIS PROJECT AS

02:29:05.736 --> 02:29:07.071
LINK THINK. IT'S TWELVE IT'S

02:29:07.138 --> 02:29:08.105
GONNA BE ABOUT A TWELVE YEAR

02:29:08.172 --> 02:29:09.640
CYCLE TO GET THIS ONLINE AND UP

02:29:09.707 --> 02:29:11.208
AND RUNNING. PERHAPS EVEN A

02:29:11.275 --> 02:29:12.710
LITTLE LONER VENDOR STANDARDS

02:29:12.777 --> 02:29:14.378
CAN BE LITIGATION THERE HIT

02:29:14.445 --> 02:29:15.813
PRETTY HARD TO BUILD ANYTHING IN

02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:16.747
CALIFORNIA WITHOUT MAJOR

02:29:16.814 --> 02:29:18.582
LITIGATION THESE DAYS. THIS IS

02:29:18.649 --> 02:29:20.518
THE PLACE WE LIVE AND WE BELIEVE

02:29:20.584 --> 02:29:22.486
WE NEED TO MODERNIZE THE SYSTEM

02:29:22.553 --> 02:29:23.487
IF WE JUST SIT HERE AND STATUS

02:29:23.554 --> 02:29:24.955
QUO INSIDE WE CAN'T BUILD

02:29:25.022 --> 02:29:26.757
ANYTHING AT THIS TO DIFFICULT.

02:29:26.824 --> 02:29:27.725
ARE I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE

02:29:27.792 --> 02:29:29.493
GOING TO GO TO FIFTY MILLION

02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:30.828
PEOPLE SUSPECT.

02:29:30.895 --> 02:29:32.296
APPRECIATE THAT AND.

02:29:32.363 --> 02:29:34.298
I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF DOCTOR

02:29:34.365 --> 02:29:35.566
JEFFREY MICHAEL FROM YOUR P. YES

02:29:35.633 --> 02:29:37.068
SIR COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS I'VE

02:29:37.134 --> 02:29:39.203
NEVER SEEN YOUR AGENCY REFUTE.

02:29:39.270 --> 02:29:40.671
HIS COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND

02:29:40.738 --> 02:29:43.507
PROVIDE YOUR OWN THAT SHOWS.

02:29:43.574 --> 02:29:45.643
HERB SOMETHING DIFFERENT SO WE

02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:47.812
ACTUALLY WORKED WITH DOCTORS

02:29:47.878 --> 02:29:48.846
HUNTINGTON ANALYSIS FOR THE

02:29:48.913 --> 02:29:50.147
STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOCTOR

02:29:50.214 --> 02:29:51.549
MICHAELS DID ONE I'M WORKING

02:29:51.615 --> 02:29:52.550
WITH RESTORE THE DEALT ANOTHER

02:29:52.616 --> 02:29:53.517
GROUPS AND.

02:29:53.584 --> 02:29:56.153
WE ALSO USED TO ANNOY ECONOMIST

02:29:56.220 --> 02:29:57.855
AT BEACON ECONOMICS IN SOUTHERN

02:29:57.922 --> 02:29:59.223
CALIFORNIA DOCTOR THORNBERG AND

02:29:59.290 --> 02:30:00.725
WE ALSO DID OUR OWN IN HOUSE

02:30:00.791 --> 02:30:01.625
ANALYSIS.

02:30:01.692 --> 02:30:03.894
SO MISTER MICHAELS FOUND IT DID

02:30:03.961 --> 02:30:05.896
NOT PASS THE BENEFITS TEST LE

02:30:05.963 --> 02:30:08.632
DOCTOR SOUNDING DR THORNBERG AND

02:30:08.699 --> 02:30:10.034
OUR OWN STAFF FILLED THE DEAD.

02:30:10.101 --> 02:30:11.435
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S

02:30:11.502 --> 02:30:12.470
WHAT OUR BOARD LOOKED AT THOSE

02:30:12.536 --> 02:30:13.938
STUDIES AND DECIDED THAT THIS

02:30:14.004 --> 02:30:16.107
DID MAKE FINANCIAL SENSE FOR

02:30:16.173 --> 02:30:17.174
METROPOLITAN. LOOK AT.

02:30:17.241 --> 02:30:19.443
BASED ON OUR PAST

02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:21.846
EXPERIENCES WITH THE.

02:30:21.912 --> 02:30:23.114
ORVILLE DAM AND.

02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:27.118
WATER CONTRACTORS OF.

02:30:27.184 --> 02:30:28.219
BEEN REMISS ON MAINTENANCE I

02:30:28.285 --> 02:30:30.020
WOULD I GUESS WHO'S BEEN THE

02:30:30.087 --> 02:30:30.321
CONCLUSION.

02:30:30.388 --> 02:30:33.257
.

02:30:33.324 --> 02:30:34.325
WHAT IF THIS PROJECT DESTROYS

02:30:34.392 --> 02:30:36.160
THE DELTA?

02:30:36.227 --> 02:30:37.361
WHAT IS WHAT IS WHAT IS

02:30:37.428 --> 02:30:39.930
METROPOLITANS COMMANDMENT?

02:30:39.997 --> 02:30:41.298
THAT AFTER THIS PROJECT IF IT

02:30:41.365 --> 02:30:42.333
WAS PUT IN PLACE LIKE THE OTHER

02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:43.667
PROJECT THE.

02:30:43.734 --> 02:30:44.735
NOW REVERSES THE FLOW OF THE

02:30:44.802 --> 02:30:46.504
DELTA.

02:30:46.570 --> 02:30:47.872
AND YOU KNOW TO BENEFIT SOUTHERN

02:30:47.938 --> 02:30:49.373
CALIFORNIA.

02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:50.708
WHAT IS

02:30:50.775 --> 02:30:52.476
PLAN B.?

02:30:52.543 --> 02:30:56.414
IF THIS TURNS THE DELTA IN TO US.

02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:57.314
SALTON FORMER.

02:30:57.381 --> 02:30:59.350
AND THE ONLY BENEFIT THEN IS

02:30:59.417 --> 02:31:01.886
WHAT WE THOUGHT. ALL ALONG VISIT

02:31:01.952 --> 02:31:03.654
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GOT A GOOD

02:31:03.721 --> 02:31:05.256
ONE AND.

02:31:05.322 --> 02:31:07.658
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AT THE SHAFT

02:31:07.725 --> 02:31:09.226
SOMEHOW IT WILL HOW DO WE KNOW.

02:31:09.293 --> 02:31:12.430
THAT BECAUSE OF PAST.

02:31:12.496 --> 02:31:14.031
EXPERIENCES NOW WITH THE DAMN

02:31:14.098 --> 02:31:16.000
REPORT WE HAD IN THE MAINTENANCE

02:31:16.066 --> 02:31:18.402
LEVELS BEING VERY VERY LOW.

02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:20.471
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

02:31:20.538 --> 02:31:23.474
WITH THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS.

02:31:23.541 --> 02:31:24.642
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE THERE?

02:31:24.708 --> 02:31:26.377
AS A BACKSTOPS.

02:31:26.444 --> 02:31:29.046
IF THIS SCREWS UP THE DELTA.

02:31:29.113 --> 02:31:30.214
AND WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE CO

02:31:30.281 --> 02:31:31.816
EQUAL GOALS METROPOLITAN WAS AN

02:31:31.882 --> 02:31:33.451
ORIGINAL SPONSOR OF THE DELTA

02:31:33.517 --> 02:31:35.586
REFORM ACT AND HELPED NEGOTIATE

02:31:35.653 --> 02:31:36.887
AND DEVELOP THAT LANGUAGE WE

02:31:36.954 --> 02:31:38.489
STRONGLY BELIEVE IN THE CO EQUAL

02:31:38.556 --> 02:31:40.291
GOALS ARE BOARD ADOPTED THEM.

02:31:40.357 --> 02:31:41.725
AND WE PARTNERED WITH AN RTC AND

02:31:41.792 --> 02:31:43.060
DEVELOPING THAT LANGUAGE AND

02:31:43.127 --> 02:31:44.094
THAT WAS A PARTNERSHIP THAT WE

02:31:44.161 --> 02:31:46.397
TOOK SERIOUSLY WE BELIEVE THOSE

02:31:46.464 --> 02:31:48.232
TWO PIECES OF IT. WATER SUPPLY

02:31:48.299 --> 02:31:49.900
RELIABILITY AND ECOSYSTEM

02:31:49.967 --> 02:31:51.535
RESTORATION AND WE'VE INVESTED

02:31:51.602 --> 02:31:53.537
MONEY IN BOTH AND WE BELIEVE

02:31:53.604 --> 02:31:54.104
BOTH HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD.

02:31:54.171 --> 02:31:56.740
ON.

02:31:56.807 --> 02:31:58.542
YOU KNOW MISTAKES MADE NINETEEN.

02:31:58.609 --> 02:32:00.211
ORVILLE WAS BUILT TO THE BEST

02:32:00.277 --> 02:32:01.178
TECHNOLOGY AT THE TIME IN

02:32:01.245 --> 02:32:02.513
NINETEEN SIXTY.

02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:04.014
AND IT FUNCTIONED WELL FOR FIFTY

02:32:04.081 --> 02:32:06.484
YEARS IT HAD A IT DID DEVELOP A

02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:08.619
CRACK AND THEN IT FELL APART. A

02:32:08.686 --> 02:32:10.521
WE HAD ISSUES WITH IT UP

02:32:10.588 --> 02:32:12.289
MAINTENANCE WAS TEN MAINTAINED

02:32:12.356 --> 02:32:13.324
AT A HIGH LEVEL THAT WAS BUT

02:32:13.390 --> 02:32:14.992
THEY WERE YOU KNOW WAS BUILT

02:32:15.059 --> 02:32:16.594
WITH NINETEEN SIXTIES TECHNOLOGY.

02:32:16.660 --> 02:32:19.196
OF WE BELIEVED AT THE TIME WHEN

02:32:19.263 --> 02:32:21.165
THEY DISCUSS THE PERIPHERAL

02:32:21.232 --> 02:32:21.932
CANAL THAT THE SMARTEST

02:32:21.999 --> 02:32:23.033
TECHNOLOGY WAS TO BUILD A VERY

02:32:23.100 --> 02:32:25.336
LARGE AND DROP OFF WATER

02:32:25.402 --> 02:32:26.504
THROUGHOUT THE DELTA TO FRESHEN

02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:28.305
IT UP. NOW TODAY WE THINK THAT

02:32:28.372 --> 02:32:29.673
WOULD BE A MISTAKE BECAUSE IT

02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:31.075
WOULD CONFUSE SALMON.

02:32:31.141 --> 02:32:32.877
WE LEARN AND WE ADAPT AS WE GO

02:32:32.943 --> 02:32:34.945
ALONG WE'RE GOING TO DUST THIS

02:32:35.012 --> 02:32:37.348
PROJECT IS THE IS THE PRODUCT OF

02:32:37.414 --> 02:32:38.916
THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE WE

02:32:38.983 --> 02:32:40.918
HAVE TODAY TO MOVE WATER IN A

02:32:40.985 --> 02:32:43.454
FISH FRIENDLY RELIABLE MANNER.

02:32:43.521 --> 02:32:45.155
PROTECTED FROM SEISMIC.

02:32:45.222 --> 02:32:47.358
WORK WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IT IS

02:32:47.424 --> 02:32:47.925
THE BEST TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE

02:32:47.992 --> 02:32:49.994
TODAY. FIFTY YEARS FROM NOW ARE

02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:51.095
WE GONNA BE SAYING I'M WHICH WE

02:32:51.161 --> 02:32:52.296
BUILT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THERE'S

02:32:52.363 --> 02:32:53.998
A CHANCE OF THAT ABSOLUTELY AND

02:32:54.064 --> 02:32:55.432
THEN WE WILL BE COMMITTED TO

02:32:55.499 --> 02:32:56.000
WORKING WITH EVERYBODY TO DO

02:32:56.066 --> 02:32:57.735
THAT.

02:32:57.801 --> 02:33:01.605
SO AND AGAIN I THINK ONE OF THE.

02:33:01.672 --> 02:33:03.507
FRIGHTENING FACTS OF.

02:33:03.574 --> 02:33:05.843
WHEN AN AGENCY GETS IN SO

02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:08.345
INVESTED INTO A PROJECT AND HAS.

02:33:08.412 --> 02:33:09.813
TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO

02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:12.349
IT IN AND WE DO GO INTO A DECADE.

02:33:12.416 --> 02:33:14.151
GOD FOR BID DROUGHT.

02:33:14.218 --> 02:33:14.919
THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A

02:33:14.985 --> 02:33:16.654
TENDENCY TO.

02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:17.655
GO AFTER.

02:33:17.721 --> 02:33:19.957
INDIAN DANGERS SPECIES TO BE

02:33:20.024 --> 02:33:22.393
ABLE TO NOW MOVE THEM OUT OF THE

02:33:22.459 --> 02:33:23.627
WAY SO THAT MONEY CAN BE SPENT

02:33:23.694 --> 02:33:25.629
BECAUSE I'VE HEARD.

02:33:25.696 --> 02:33:28.299
PEOPLE BEFORE FANA OR FISH.

02:33:28.365 --> 02:33:30.334
OKAY IS AS IT IS KIND OF AN

02:33:30.401 --> 02:33:32.436
NOMENCLATURE DOWN THERE.

02:33:32.503 --> 02:33:35.105
AND THEN AGAIN.

02:33:35.172 --> 02:33:36.907
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT

02:33:36.974 --> 02:33:37.575
GONNA WHEN YOU HAVE THIS

02:33:37.641 --> 02:33:39.743
INVESTMENT IN HIS?

02:33:39.810 --> 02:33:42.079
CERTAINLY SIR I MEAN I'VE DONE.

02:33:42.146 --> 02:33:43.080
SEVERAL BILLS TO PROTECT MY

02:33:43.147 --> 02:33:44.515
DELTA.

02:33:44.582 --> 02:33:46.216
AND NONE OF THEM GOT AND I HAVE

02:33:46.283 --> 02:33:47.718
TO GIVE YOUR AGENCY IN A LOT OF

02:33:47.785 --> 02:33:48.586
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:33:48.652 --> 02:33:50.521
CONTRACTORS THE CREDIT. NONE OF

02:33:50.588 --> 02:33:51.989
THEM GOT OUT A COMMITTEE BECAUSE

02:33:52.056 --> 02:33:53.023
OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:33:53.090 --> 02:33:54.425
INFLUENCE.

02:33:54.491 --> 02:33:56.293
ON THE DELTA.

02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:56.694
AND.

02:33:56.760 --> 02:33:58.829
YOU KNOW I USED TO BEYOND

02:33:58.896 --> 02:34:00.431
WATERPARKS AWHILE BUT BECAUSE OF

02:34:00.497 --> 02:34:02.967
MY STAND TO PROTECT THE DELTA.

02:34:03.033 --> 02:34:04.435
I FIRMLY BELIEVE I WAS REMOVED I

02:34:04.501 --> 02:34:06.303
AM ASKED TO GET OFF.

02:34:06.370 --> 02:34:07.404
AND SO.

02:34:07.471 --> 02:34:09.406
AGAIN.

02:34:09.473 --> 02:34:11.342
HOW DO WE HAVE ASSURANCES THAT

02:34:11.408 --> 02:34:12.710
YOU SPENDING TENS OF BILLIONS OF

02:34:12.776 --> 02:34:14.979
DOLLARS ON A PROJECT?

02:34:15.045 --> 02:34:16.046
THEY THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO

02:34:16.113 --> 02:34:17.448
AFTER THE INDIES ENDANGERED

02:34:17.514 --> 02:34:18.415
SPECIES ACT.

02:34:18.482 --> 02:34:20.317
AND AND.

02:34:20.384 --> 02:34:22.586
DECIMATE A SPECIES TO PUT.

02:34:22.653 --> 02:34:23.721
PEOPLE BEFORE.

02:34:23.787 --> 02:34:25.589
ENVIRONMENT

02:34:25.656 --> 02:34:26.490
WELL SIR I CAN ASSURE YOU WE

02:34:26.557 --> 02:34:27.891
DIDN'T ASK THAT YOU BE TAKEN OFF

02:34:27.958 --> 02:34:29.293
THE COMMITTEE EITHER WELL BUT

02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:32.930
ABSOLUTELY NOT SO.

02:34:32.997 --> 02:34:34.431
I WASN'T TRACKING AND TO BE

02:34:34.498 --> 02:34:35.866
PERFECTLY HONEST ARE SO. WE

02:34:35.933 --> 02:34:38.402
WORKED.

02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:39.536
WE WHAT WE WERE COMMITTED TO THE

02:34:39.603 --> 02:34:41.271
CO EQUAL GOALS AND THAT IS BOTH

02:34:41.338 --> 02:34:43.474
ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION AS WELL AS

02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:44.775
WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY OUR

02:34:44.842 --> 02:34:46.610
AGENCY HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED WE

02:34:46.677 --> 02:34:48.312
CAN WORK. WITHIN THE ENDANGERED

02:34:48.379 --> 02:34:50.347
SPECIES ACT TO MAKE THIS WORK WE

02:34:50.414 --> 02:34:52.049
HAVE TO FIND A BALANCE.

02:34:52.116 --> 02:34:53.851
WE INVEST IN.

02:34:53.917 --> 02:34:55.586
FISH PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE THINK

02:34:55.653 --> 02:34:56.854
IT'S IN OUR SELF INTEREST TO

02:34:56.920 --> 02:34:58.222
HAVE THE FISH DO BETTER BECAUSE

02:34:58.288 --> 02:34:59.456
THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

02:34:59.523 --> 02:35:01.525
OPERATE MORE FLEXIBLY.

02:35:01.592 --> 02:35:03.927
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED.

02:35:03.994 --> 02:35:05.462
OUR COLORADO RIVER SUPPLIES

02:35:05.529 --> 02:35:06.964
FIFTEEN OF THE LAST EIGHTEEN

02:35:07.031 --> 02:35:08.532
YEARS HAVE BEEN DRY SOME OF THE

02:35:08.599 --> 02:35:10.200
DRIEST YEARS IN OVER TWELVE

02:35:10.267 --> 02:35:11.602
HUNDRED YEARS BASED ON TREE

02:35:11.669 --> 02:35:13.404
RINGS ON THE COLORADO RIVER. IN

02:35:13.470 --> 02:35:14.705
THE LAST DECADE IN CALIFORNIA

02:35:14.772 --> 02:35:16.240
NINE OF THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS

02:35:16.306 --> 02:35:17.975
HAVE BEEN TRY AGAIN SOME OF THE

02:35:18.042 --> 02:35:19.276
DRIEST YEARS ALMOST FIFTEEN

02:35:19.343 --> 02:35:21.111
HUNDRED YEARS. WE'VE GONE

02:35:21.178 --> 02:35:22.813
THROUGH UP REALLY DIFFICULT

02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:24.548
DROUGHT AND WE HAVE NOT HAD TO

02:35:24.615 --> 02:35:26.350
RESORT TO AUSTRALIA OR CAPETOWN

02:35:26.417 --> 02:35:28.452
TACTICS TO DELIVER OR WATER OR

02:35:28.519 --> 02:35:30.187
DO EMERGENCY CRASH BUILDING.

02:35:30.254 --> 02:35:31.822
MAINLY BECAUSE WE PREPARED FOR

02:35:31.889 --> 02:35:33.157
THIS AND DONE PRETTY WELL WITH

02:35:33.223 --> 02:35:33.590
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:35:33.657 --> 02:35:35.125
AND

02:35:35.192 --> 02:35:36.460
THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS

02:35:36.527 --> 02:35:37.594
WE'VE RESPECTED THE ENDANGERED

02:35:37.661 --> 02:35:39.697
SPECIES ACT WE HAVEN'T RAMROD

02:35:39.763 --> 02:35:41.298
THROUGH DO BILLS NOT WHAT

02:35:41.365 --> 02:35:42.833
METROPOLITAN HAS NOT BEEN

02:35:42.900 --> 02:35:45.302
WORKING AND CONGRESS. ARE SO

02:35:45.369 --> 02:35:47.705
THERE HAS NOT BEEN A. MAJOR

02:35:47.771 --> 02:35:48.238
GETTING OF THE ENDANGERED

02:35:48.305 --> 02:35:49.273
SPECIES ACT.

02:35:49.339 --> 02:35:50.674
THERE ARE STILL CHALLENGES NO

02:35:50.741 --> 02:35:51.875
DOUBT ABOUT IT THESE ARE TOUGH

02:35:51.942 --> 02:35:53.177
TIMES WE ARE GOING THROUGH AN

02:35:53.243 --> 02:35:55.713
INCREDIBLY DRY PERIOD AND.

02:35:55.779 --> 02:35:56.580
FISHER SUFFERING FARMS ARE

02:35:56.647 --> 02:35:58.248
SUFFERING PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING

02:35:58.315 --> 02:35:59.650
BUT WE'RE MANAGING THROUGH IT

02:35:59.717 --> 02:36:01.418
AND WE'RE PROTECTING AND

02:36:01.485 --> 02:36:02.019
RESPECTING THOSE LAWS THAT WE

02:36:02.086 --> 02:36:03.620
HAVE.

02:36:03.687 --> 02:36:05.989
ONE MORE QUESTION PART SO YOU DO

02:36:06.056 --> 02:36:07.725
TALK ABOUT THE THE RESTRUCTURING

02:36:07.791 --> 02:36:10.627
OF THE LEVEES IN THE DELTA WELL.

02:36:10.694 --> 02:36:12.162
I WOULD SAY PROBABLY A LARGE

02:36:12.229 --> 02:36:13.630
MAJORITY THE TELCOS

02:36:13.697 --> 02:36:14.832
LEVEES ARE SUPPORTED BY

02:36:14.898 --> 02:36:16.667
RECLAMATION DISTRICTS

02:36:16.734 --> 02:36:17.668
BETTER ON THE HOOKED UP TO

02:36:17.735 --> 02:36:19.203
MAINTAIN THOSE LEVEES ON THEIR

02:36:19.269 --> 02:36:20.838
OWN IN THE. FARMERS PAY FOR IT

02:36:20.904 --> 02:36:22.272
OUT OF THEIR PROFITS

02:36:22.339 --> 02:36:24.374
AND SO WE HAD PROP ONE THE THAT

02:36:24.441 --> 02:36:26.043
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SUPPLEMENT

02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:28.011
TO THAT I THINK WE STE. TOOK TWO

02:36:28.078 --> 02:36:29.513
BILLION DOLLARS FROM MONEY

02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:31.849
INSULATED OVER INTO ONE A AS A.

02:36:31.915 --> 02:36:34.184
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A SEVEN

02:36:34.251 --> 02:36:35.085
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AS

02:36:35.152 --> 02:36:37.254
HEAD OF THE FIVE BILLION THAT

02:36:37.321 --> 02:36:38.322
WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE

02:36:38.388 --> 02:36:38.589
FINANCED.

02:36:38.655 --> 02:36:38.722
.

02:36:38.789 --> 02:36:40.858
SO.

02:36:40.924 --> 02:36:41.759
YOU KNOW YOU COULDN'T HEAR

02:36:41.825 --> 02:36:43.460
AGENCY WENT OUT AND BOUGHT FIVE

02:36:43.527 --> 02:36:45.095
ISLANDS OUT IN THE DELTA. ON

02:36:45.162 --> 02:36:47.131
THAT WERE FORM FORM COMMUNITIES.

02:36:47.197 --> 02:36:48.699
.

02:36:48.766 --> 02:36:50.467
YOU KNOW IN AND.

02:36:50.534 --> 02:36:52.536
HEAVILY LADEN WITH ARSENIC AND

02:36:52.603 --> 02:36:54.404
ALL OF THESE OTHER FARMING.

02:36:54.471 --> 02:36:56.373
ISSUES.

02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:58.208
AND THEN I HEARD YOU KNOW IT IT

02:36:58.275 --> 02:36:58.776
INITIALLY WAS GONNA BE FOR

02:36:58.842 --> 02:37:01.378
STORAGE AND DIFFERENT OPTIONS IN

02:37:01.445 --> 02:37:01.612
ONE ON.

02:37:01.678 --> 02:37:04.481
.

02:37:04.548 --> 02:37:05.849
SOME JUST SOME OF THE STUFF THAT

02:37:05.916 --> 02:37:07.451
YOU YOU GUYS ARE CLAIMING WE

02:37:07.518 --> 02:37:08.652
DON'T HAVE IN PLACE WHERE

02:37:08.719 --> 02:37:09.820
WRITTEN RECLAMATION DISTRICTS

02:37:09.887 --> 02:37:12.189
HAVE SUBVENTION. ACT IN PLACE A.

02:37:12.256 --> 02:37:13.323
SO.

02:37:13.390 --> 02:37:15.259
I MEAN.

02:37:15.325 --> 02:37:17.094
WHEN WE FIRST SAW.

02:37:17.161 --> 02:37:19.463
THE BCP AND ITS INCEPTION WAS

02:37:19.530 --> 02:37:20.430
GOING TO BE THIS BIG

02:37:20.497 --> 02:37:22.499
CONSERVATION PLAN TO THE FIX

02:37:22.566 --> 02:37:24.201
EVERYTHING.

02:37:24.268 --> 02:37:24.735
THEN FIGURED OUT YOU COULD

02:37:24.802 --> 02:37:26.937
AFFORD IT.

02:37:27.004 --> 02:37:27.571
AND THEN SO NOW IT'S JUST ABOUT

02:37:27.638 --> 02:37:30.174
THE WATER.

02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:31.842
AND NO ONE IS GOING TO BE DONE

02:37:31.909 --> 02:37:33.443
TO THE DELTA.

02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:36.446
BUT IN CASE IN FACT I REALLY.

02:37:36.513 --> 02:37:38.649
I REALLY THINK THAT YOU KNOW.

02:37:38.715 --> 02:37:40.317
WHEN I SEE SALINITY BARRIERS

02:37:40.384 --> 02:37:42.119
GOING IN PLACE.

02:37:42.186 --> 02:37:44.555
WHEN WE HAVE LOW FLOW YEARS.

02:37:44.621 --> 02:37:47.457
I DID OF YOURS PUTTING IN PLACE.

02:37:47.524 --> 02:37:50.994
AT FALSE RIVER IN AND OLD RIVER.

02:37:51.061 --> 02:37:52.062
AND THEY WANT TO PUT HIM IN

02:37:52.129 --> 02:37:53.630
STEAMBOAT SLOUGH IN DIFFERENT

02:37:53.697 --> 02:37:56.233
POSITIONS.

02:37:56.300 --> 02:37:57.734
IF YOU CONTINUE TO DRAIN THE

02:37:57.801 --> 02:38:00.270
DELTA.

02:38:00.337 --> 02:38:01.371
HIGHER UP IN THE NORTHERN INTAKE

02:38:01.438 --> 02:38:03.440
AT CORTLAND.

02:38:03.507 --> 02:38:05.008
YOU'RE GONNA DIMINISH SHALL FLOW

02:38:05.075 --> 02:38:07.010
AND SELECT IS GONNA COME UP.

02:38:07.077 --> 02:38:09.213
AND RECREATION WILL SUFFER

02:38:09.279 --> 02:38:10.647
AND BOATING WILL SUFFER IF WE

02:38:10.714 --> 02:38:12.015
HAVE TO PUT SALUTE ANY BARRIERS

02:38:12.082 --> 02:38:14.685
BECAUSE OF THIS PROJECT.

02:38:14.751 --> 02:38:16.220
THESE ARE JUST TRUE FACTS.

02:38:16.286 --> 02:38:18.255
AND.

02:38:18.322 --> 02:38:20.023
I I REALLY THINK THE LEGISLATURE

02:38:20.090 --> 02:38:21.725
NEEDS TO WEIGH IN AND PUT SOME

02:38:21.792 --> 02:38:23.293
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE.

02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:24.394
SOME BENCHMARKS AND SOME BASS

02:38:24.461 --> 02:38:26.263
LINES.

02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:28.365
AND SOME ACTION ITEMS.

02:38:28.432 --> 02:38:29.833
BEFORE THIS THING GETS OUT OF

02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:32.636
HAND AND AND THAT AND ESTATE

02:38:32.703 --> 02:38:34.838
AGENCIES. CREATING. WITH A.

02:38:36.306 --> 02:38:37.875
WILL MOVE WATER CONTRACTORS

02:38:37.941 --> 02:38:39.776
THEIR OWN PURPOSE.

02:38:39.843 --> 02:38:41.311
I THINK THE WE NEED THANK YOU

02:38:41.378 --> 02:38:42.646
FOR DOING THIS HEARING ALL THREE

02:38:42.713 --> 02:38:44.314
OF YOU CHAIRS.

02:38:44.381 --> 02:38:45.682
SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A VOICE

02:38:45.749 --> 02:38:46.650
AND BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE

02:38:46.717 --> 02:38:48.318
COLLECTIVELY.

02:38:48.385 --> 02:38:50.087
THAT WHAT WE GOAL WE'RE UP IN

02:38:50.153 --> 02:38:51.855
SACRAMENTO TO DO SOMETHING AND

02:38:51.922 --> 02:38:54.291
THAT'S TO PROTECT ALL.

02:38:54.358 --> 02:38:56.760
NOT JUST SOME.

02:38:56.827 --> 02:38:58.028
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO

02:38:58.095 --> 02:38:59.897
GO THROUGH HERE CREATE OUR OWN

02:38:59.963 --> 02:39:01.965
COST BENEFIT NOW. COST BENEFIT

02:39:02.032 --> 02:39:03.533
ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND.

02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:05.702
WHAT WILL AND WHAT WILL NOT WORK

02:39:05.769 --> 02:39:07.170
IN OUR MINDS THAT REPRESENTS THE

02:39:07.237 --> 02:39:09.139
PEOPLE?

02:39:09.206 --> 02:39:11.541
IT HAS AS IT IS NOW RIGHT NOW.

02:39:11.608 --> 02:39:12.342
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A

02:39:12.409 --> 02:39:15.078
TRAGEDY ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY THAT IF

02:39:15.145 --> 02:39:16.947
THIS GOES FORWARD. HELLO.

02:39:17.014 --> 02:39:18.282
I HOPE.

02:39:18.348 --> 02:39:19.616
I HOPE.

02:39:19.683 --> 02:39:21.585
BUT I'M NOT HERE.

02:39:21.652 --> 02:39:23.987
WHEN THIS THING JUST ABSOLUTELY.

02:39:24.054 --> 02:39:25.188
DEVASTATES THE DELTA.

02:39:25.255 --> 02:39:28.825
I CAN ENTER.

02:39:28.892 --> 02:39:29.693
UP MISTER BINYON MISTER BLOWN

02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:30.861

PROJECT THAT THE BOARD CAN ALSO

02:41:47.297 --> 02:41:48.999
CHOOSE NOT TO PROVE THE PROJECT

PROJECT IT WOULD ALSO HAVE

02:42:03.346 --> 02:42:04.848

CONCERNS WITH THE OPERATIONS OF

02:42:21.998 --> 02:42:23.567
THE PROJECT SIMPLY THAT THEY

02:42:23.633 --> 02:42:24.601
WERE NOT COMPARTMENTS WITH WATER

02:42:24.668 --> 02:42:27.003

USE AND PROTECTION OF BENEFICIAL

02:42:31.808 --> 02:42:33.810
USE THAT SO. THERE ARE A VARIETY

02:42:33.877 --> 02:42:35.812
OF MECHANISMS BY WHICH THE BOARD

02:42:35.879 --> 02:42:37.781

OVER THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND

02:42:39.116 --> 02:42:40.650
SUCH ABOUT A PROJECT WITH THEIR

02:42:40.717 --> 02:42:42.619
WITHOUT THE WATER FIX PROJECT

02:42:42.686 --> 02:42:44.788
ARM BUT. AND THERE THAT THERE

02:42:44.855 --> 02:42:46.556
ARE THE SPECIFIC ARAB ADDITIONAL

02:42:46.623 --> 02:42:49.092
REQUIREMENTS BUILT INTO THE

02:42:49.159 --> 02:42:49.359
WATER FIX.

02:42:49.426 --> 02:42:49.993
.

02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:51.228
PROCESS RELATED TO THE ADULTS

02:42:51.294 --> 02:42:53.463
REFORM ACT THAT WOULD ALSO PLAY

02:42:53.530 --> 02:42:55.298
A PART IN THE PROCESS. OKAY WITH

02:42:55.365 --> 02:42:57.200
SO. AND JUSTICE TO SIT BACK SO

02:42:57.267 --> 02:42:58.401
ALL THOSE LONG LINES OF MISTER

02:42:58.468 --> 02:43:00.370
PATTERSON STE. QUESTIONS EARLIER

02:43:00.437 --> 02:43:02.038
THAT YOU WOMEN WE MIGHT BE

02:43:02.105 --> 02:43:03.874
SPENDING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS

02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:04.875
TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

02:43:04.941 --> 02:43:06.209
AND IT REALLY WOULDN'T BE ABLE

02:43:06.276 --> 02:43:06.877
TO INCREASE THE FLOW ANY

02:43:06.943 --> 02:43:08.678
POTENTIALLY.

02:43:08.745 --> 02:43:09.980
ALTHOUGH THERE'S A LOT OF WORRY

02:43:10.046 --> 02:43:11.481
THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA BUILD TWO

02:43:11.548 --> 02:43:13.316
MASSIVE FORTY FEET TUNNELS A

02:43:13.383 --> 02:43:14.251
HUNDRED FIFTY FEET BELOW THE

02:43:14.317 --> 02:43:15.785
GROUND. YOU'RE GONNA LET THE

02:43:15.852 --> 02:43:17.053
WATER FLOW TO THOSE AT THE TO

02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:18.455
KIND OF THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:43:18.522 --> 02:43:20.056
CORRECT THE TO FIT THE TO FEARS

02:43:20.123 --> 02:43:21.558
THAT PEOPLE HAVE. THEY WOULD

02:43:21.625 --> 02:43:22.359
SPEND TENS OF BILLIONS OF

02:43:22.425 --> 02:43:23.727
DOLLARS AND IT'S NOT GONNA

02:43:23.793 --> 02:43:25.795
PRODUCE ONE EXTRA DROP. MBE

02:43:25.862 --> 02:43:26.563
YOU'RE GONNA SAY WE'VE BUILT

02:43:26.630 --> 02:43:28.098
THESE MASSIVE THINGS WE'VE

02:43:28.165 --> 02:43:30.500
INVESTED ALL OF THIS MONEY. FOR

02:43:30.567 --> 02:43:31.101
SURE WE NEED TO LET THAT WATER

02:43:31.168 --> 02:43:32.135
FLOW.

02:43:32.202 --> 02:43:33.670
pSO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:43:33.737 --> 02:43:36.273
REASONS AND THAT.

02:43:36.339 --> 02:43:37.207
INSTRUCTION ON THE WATER FIX

02:43:37.274 --> 02:43:38.341
IT'S AN AUTHORIZED UNTIL THE

02:43:38.408 --> 02:43:40.277
BOARD ISSUES ITS DECISION ON THE

02:43:40.343 --> 02:43:42.479
WATER RIGHT CHANGE PETITION SO.

02:43:42.546 --> 02:43:44.581
I THINK BUILT INTO THAT PROCESS

02:43:44.648 --> 02:43:45.982
IS THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE

02:43:46.049 --> 02:43:47.751
IF THE BOARD WILL IDENTIFY THE

02:43:47.817 --> 02:43:49.052
APPROPRIATE DELTA FOKKER TERRY

02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:50.954
AND OTHER CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH.

02:43:51.021 --> 02:43:52.389
THE PROJECT WOULD BE APPROVED

02:43:52.455 --> 02:43:53.590
AND THAT WOULD INFORM THE

02:43:53.657 --> 02:43:55.659
DECISION MAKERS ON YOU KNOW

02:43:55.725 --> 02:43:57.327
WHETHER. AND UNDER WHAT

02:43:57.394 --> 02:43:59.062
CONDITIONS THAT MAKE SENSE TO ME

02:43:59.129 --> 02:44:00.163
FOR WITH THE PROJECT.

02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:00.997
FOR THAT WOULD BE PART OF I

02:44:01.064 --> 02:44:02.566
THINK THE CALCULUS AND THE

02:44:02.632 --> 02:44:03.800
FURTHER DECISION MAKING ON THE

02:44:03.867 --> 02:44:05.802
PROCESS OF THE PROJECT.

02:44:05.869 --> 02:44:07.070
SO BE IT. YEAH I THINK YOU GET

02:44:07.137 --> 02:44:08.772
MADAM CHAIR I THINK MS RIDDLE

02:44:08.838 --> 02:44:09.372
FOR COMING UP IN AND TRIED IN

02:44:09.439 --> 02:44:10.473
SOME.

02:44:10.540 --> 02:44:12.475
CLARITY ON THE POWERS OF THE

02:44:12.542 --> 02:44:13.843
WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD.

02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:15.579
IN LIGHT OF THOSE QUESTIONS.

02:44:15.645 --> 02:44:17.847
AND DIED IN AND JUST REFLECT A

02:44:17.914 --> 02:44:19.282
LITTLE BIT ON ON MADAM SHARES

02:44:19.349 --> 02:44:20.483
COMMENTS JUST NOW I THINK THAT A

02:44:20.550 --> 02:44:22.219
LOT OF ADVOCATES.

02:44:22.285 --> 02:44:24.221
COULD SAY I THOUGHT ABOUT MORE

02:44:24.287 --> 02:44:25.589
WATER IT'S ABOUT.

02:44:25.655 --> 02:44:26.556
SO CERTAINTY THAT A BETTER

02:44:26.623 --> 02:44:28.325
SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE FOR A

02:44:28.391 --> 02:44:29.359
HEALTHIER ECOSYSTEM.

02:44:29.426 --> 02:44:31.428
.

02:44:31.494 --> 02:44:32.929
AND DIE AND THEN OTHERS WOULD

02:44:32.996 --> 02:44:34.464
SAY NO NO IT'S MORE ABOUT BE WE

02:44:34.531 --> 02:44:35.832
JUST WANT WATER WE DON'T REALLY

02:44:35.899 --> 02:44:36.433
CARE ABOUT THOSE OTHER THINGS

02:44:36.499 --> 02:44:37.734
BUT.

02:44:37.801 --> 02:44:39.202
I THINK WHAT TIED MY COLLEAGUE

02:44:39.269 --> 02:44:41.304
FROM DISCOVERY BAY RAISED WHICH

02:44:41.371 --> 02:44:41.805
I THINK IS YOU KNOW THE

02:44:41.871 --> 02:44:42.906
NIGHTMARE SCENARIO OF.

02:44:42.973 --> 02:44:44.174
WE WE BUILD SOMETHING THAT DOES

02:44:44.241 --> 02:44:46.576
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OF WHAT WE

02:44:46.643 --> 02:44:47.644
WANTED IN FACT MAKES THINGS

02:44:47.711 --> 02:44:48.678
WORSE. ON.

02:44:48.745 --> 02:44:50.413
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS ONCE WE

02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:51.615
WE SPEND THAT MONEY AND PUT THE

02:44:51.681 --> 02:44:53.383
SWITCH AND REALIZE THIS IS

02:44:53.450 --> 02:44:53.650
ACTUALLY.

02:44:53.717 --> 02:44:54.851
.

02:44:54.918 --> 02:44:57.420
HAS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ALL

02:44:57.487 --> 02:44:59.422
AROUND THAT THE. YOU KNOW ALL

02:44:59.489 --> 02:45:01.891
THE BENEFITS ADDED UP DON'T SAT

02:45:01.958 --> 02:45:02.993
ADD UP TO MORE OF THE NEGATIVE

02:45:03.059 --> 02:45:05.028
CONSEQUENCES AND. WHAT WITH THE

02:45:05.095 --> 02:45:07.197
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD'S COURSE

02:45:07.264 --> 02:45:07.831
OF ACTION BE IN A SITUATION LIKE

02:45:07.897 --> 02:45:13.103
THAT?

02:45:13.169 --> 02:45:14.871
I THINK THE DECISION REGARDING

02:45:14.938 --> 02:45:16.439
THE FUNDING ASPECTS OF THIS

02:45:16.506 --> 02:45:18.008
PROJECT WHAT WILL BE CONSIDERED

02:45:18.074 --> 02:45:19.676
BY THE STATE WATER BOARD IN ITS

02:45:19.743 --> 02:45:20.910
CONSIDERATION OF PUBLIC

02:45:20.977 --> 02:45:22.879
INTERESTS OF THE PROJECT SO THAT

02:45:22.946 --> 02:45:25.248
IS. PART OF THE HEARING PROCESS

02:45:25.315 --> 02:45:26.349
AND PART OF WHAT THE BOARD WILL

02:45:26.416 --> 02:45:27.617
DISSIPATE DECIDE UPON A AND

02:45:27.684 --> 02:45:28.852
WHETHER TO APPROVE THE PROJECT

02:45:28.918 --> 02:45:31.254
OR NOT.

02:45:31.321 --> 02:45:32.489
AND I AM AS FAR AS GOING TO LET

02:45:32.555 --> 02:45:34.524
YOU DO IT IS I MEAN.

02:45:34.591 --> 02:45:36.293
SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE

02:45:36.359 --> 02:45:37.927
CRITERIA THAT THE BOARD IS

02:45:37.994 --> 02:45:40.397
ASSESSING THE APPROVAL OF THE

02:45:40.463 --> 02:45:42.132
ATWATER FIX CHANGE PETITION

02:45:42.198 --> 02:45:44.701
PROJECT ON. IS WHETHER THE

02:45:44.768 --> 02:45:45.969
PROJECT IS IN THE PUBLIC

02:45:46.036 --> 02:45:47.337
INTEREST ARE NOT SO IN ADDITION

02:45:47.404 --> 02:45:49.639
TO LOOKING AT. POTENTIAL IMPACTS

02:45:49.706 --> 02:45:51.574
TO OTHER LEGAL USERS OF WATER

02:45:51.641 --> 02:45:53.376
AND IMPACTS DEFICIENT WILDLIFE

02:45:53.443 --> 02:45:55.278
THE PORT IS ALSO CONSIDERING

02:45:55.345 --> 02:45:56.746
PUBLIC INTEREST CONSIDERATIONS.

02:45:56.813 --> 02:45:59.149
THAT'S A FAIRLY BROAD A HUNDRED

02:45:59.215 --> 02:46:00.517
SUBJECT MATTER AREA AND THE

02:46:00.583 --> 02:46:03.219
BOARD HAS A LIMITED SUBSET. OF

02:46:03.286 --> 02:46:04.921
AUTHORITIES WITHIN THAT AREA BUT

02:46:04.988 --> 02:46:06.089
THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE

02:46:06.156 --> 02:46:08.291
CONSIDERATIONS ONE OF THE ISSUES

02:46:08.358 --> 02:46:08.858
THAT IS PART OF THE HEARING

02:46:08.925 --> 02:46:10.493
PROCESS.

02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:11.661
OKAY THANK YOU AND AND THANKS

02:46:11.728 --> 02:46:13.229
MADAM CHAIR FOR FOR REALIZING

02:46:13.296 --> 02:46:14.764
THAT I AYE MAYBE MY QUESTION

02:46:14.831 --> 02:46:16.399
ISN'T CLEAR ENOUGH. UP LET'S SAY

02:46:16.466 --> 02:46:18.268
LET'S BE VERY SPECIFIC THAT

02:46:18.335 --> 02:46:19.836
ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS NEVER

02:46:19.903 --> 02:46:21.871
MATERIALIZED AND IN FACT IT IS

02:46:21.938 --> 02:46:23.139
MORE HARMFUL.

02:46:23.206 --> 02:46:26.176
AND I AS WE KNOW IN IN A DROUGHT

02:46:26.242 --> 02:46:28.645
YEARS WATER DELIVERIES CAN BE.

02:46:28.712 --> 02:46:29.479
STOPPED.

02:46:29.546 --> 02:46:31.247
.

02:46:31.314 --> 02:46:32.949
WOULD THAT BE RECOURSE FOR THE

02:46:33.016 --> 02:46:35.185
WATER AT THE CONTROL BOARD IN

02:46:35.251 --> 02:46:37.821
THAT INSTANCE. OR I WOULD THERE

02:46:37.887 --> 02:46:40.056
BE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE

02:46:40.123 --> 02:46:41.791
BOARD CONSIDERS.

02:46:41.858 --> 02:46:43.126
IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTMENT OR

02:46:43.193 --> 02:46:44.994
OTHER BENEFITS.

02:46:45.061 --> 02:46:46.796
GIVEN YOU KNOW WE FLIP THE

02:46:46.863 --> 02:46:48.398
SWITCH AND IN FACT

02:46:48.465 --> 02:46:49.899
MORE FISH ARE DYING AND THE

02:46:49.966 --> 02:46:51.067
SYSTEM IS IN A WORSE PLACE IT

02:46:51.134 --> 02:46:53.903
WAS PRIOR.

02:46:53.970 --> 02:46:55.839
SO ANY APPROVAL OF THE WATER FIX

02:46:55.905 --> 02:46:58.141
PROJECT WOULD INCLUDE CONDITIONS

02:46:58.208 --> 02:46:59.676
AND ONGOING AUTHORITY OF THE

02:46:59.743 --> 02:47:00.977
BOARD TO LOOK AT WHETHER THAT'S

02:47:01.044 --> 02:47:02.979
CONDITIONS ARE ADEQUATE TO AVOID

02:47:03.046 --> 02:47:04.547
AND REASONABLE IMPACTS DEFICIENT

02:47:04.614 --> 02:47:06.182
WILDLIFE AND OTHER LEGAL USERS

02:47:06.249 --> 02:47:07.450
WATER. SO IT'S PART OF THAT

02:47:07.517 --> 02:47:09.319
PROCESS THAT COULD INVOLVE

02:47:09.386 --> 02:47:11.254
LIMITATIONS ON DIVERSIONS OF

02:47:11.321 --> 02:47:13.723
WATER INTO FUTURE. CHANGES TO

02:47:13.790 --> 02:47:15.058
THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE

02:47:15.125 --> 02:47:16.659
PROJECT OF THEM AS APPROVED OR

02:47:16.726 --> 02:47:17.560
NOT.

02:47:17.627 --> 02:47:20.663
ALSO I THINK IN IT AND WEBER IF

02:47:20.730 --> 02:47:22.132
THE BOARD CHIEF OF SUCH TO

02:47:22.198 --> 02:47:23.233
APPROVE THE PROJECT IT WOULD

02:47:23.299 --> 02:47:25.301
INCLUDE CONDITION THAT WOULD

02:47:25.368 --> 02:47:26.035
LOOK AT.

02:47:26.102 --> 02:47:27.504
WHETHER OF THE PROJECT IS

02:47:27.570 --> 02:47:29.205
ACTUALLY DOING WHAT IT'S

02:47:29.272 --> 02:47:31.040
INTENDED TO DO WHICH AND WOULD

02:47:31.107 --> 02:47:32.275
INVOLVE SOME SORT OF WOULD

02:47:32.342 --> 02:47:33.610
LIKELY INVOLVE SOME SORT OF.

02:47:33.676 --> 02:47:36.112
REGULAR REVIEW PROCESS ON THOSE

02:47:36.179 --> 02:47:38.047
ISSUES SO AT AGAIN.

02:47:38.114 --> 02:47:41.017
NOTHING IS A CERTAIN STONE ONCE

02:47:41.084 --> 02:47:42.919
THE BOARD AT APPROVED APPROVED

02:47:42.986 --> 02:47:44.687
THE PROJECT THE BOARD HAS THAT

02:47:44.754 --> 02:47:46.456
CONTINUED AUTHORITY TO ENSURE

02:47:46.523 --> 02:47:49.025
THAT. THE REQUIREMENTS RELATED

02:47:49.092 --> 02:47:51.761
TO PROTECTIONS. A FISH MY WIFE

02:47:51.828 --> 02:47:53.196
AND LEGAL USERS OF WATER ARE IN

02:47:53.263 --> 02:47:54.864
PLACE.

02:47:54.931 --> 02:47:56.399
IN ADDITION THE BOARD HAS AND

02:47:56.466 --> 02:47:58.034
IT'S PROCESS TO ESTABLISH WATER

02:47:58.101 --> 02:47:59.402
QUALITY OBJECTIVE SEARCH FOR THE

02:47:59.469 --> 02:48:00.937
PROTECTION OF.

02:48:01.004 --> 02:48:02.439
PITCH TAMALE BENEFICIAL USES AND

02:48:02.505 --> 02:48:04.274
OTHER BENEFICIAL USE AND EIGHT

02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:06.075
HAS A CONTINUING OBLIGATION TO

02:48:06.142 --> 02:48:07.610
REVIEW THOSE REQUIREMENTS ON A

02:48:07.677 --> 02:48:09.512
REGULAR BASIS. AND UPDATE THEM

02:48:09.579 --> 02:48:10.747
AS NEEDED TO ENSURE THE

02:48:10.814 --> 02:48:11.614
REASONABLE PROTECTION OF

02:48:11.681 --> 02:48:13.016
BENEFICIAL USE OF AND THAT

02:48:13.082 --> 02:48:14.784
REQUIREMENT WOULD EXTEND TO. ALL

02:48:14.851 --> 02:48:16.252
WATER USERS IN THE BASIN IN

02:48:16.319 --> 02:48:17.587
ADDITION TO THE WATER FIX AND

02:48:17.654 --> 02:48:18.922
THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT AND

02:48:18.988 --> 02:48:20.857
STATE WATER PROJECT SO. I THINK

02:48:20.924 --> 02:48:21.825
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

02:48:21.891 --> 02:48:23.793
MECHANISMS IN PLACE THERE BOTH

02:48:23.860 --> 02:48:24.761
REQUIRE.

02:48:24.828 --> 02:48:25.662
THE BOARD TO LOOK AT THE

02:48:25.728 --> 02:48:27.297
REASONABLE PROTECTION BENEFICIAL

02:48:27.363 --> 02:48:29.732
USES OVERTIME ADAM AND ALLOW THE

02:48:29.799 --> 02:48:31.334
BOARD TO PROVIDE MECHANISMS IN

02:48:31.401 --> 02:48:33.336
ORDER TO DO THAT. I THINK YOU

02:48:33.403 --> 02:48:33.636
FOR FOR.

02:48:34.838 --> 02:48:36.239
SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO.

02:48:36.306 --> 02:48:38.308
THAT THE POWERS OF THE BOARD A

02:48:38.374 --> 02:48:39.742
LOT OF THE CONCERNS.

02:48:39.809 --> 02:48:41.544
THAT PEOPLE HAVE

02:48:41.611 --> 02:48:43.012
TALKING AT THE NEW TUNNELS

02:48:43.079 --> 02:48:44.380
<u>HETHER OR NOT IT WOULD PROVIDE</u>

02:48:44.447 --> 02:48:45.682
MORE WATER THAN IT DID IN THE

02:48:45.748 --> 02:48:47.083
PAST IF THERE WERE TWO OF THE

02:48:47.150 --> 02:48:48.218
TUNNELS OR A BIGGER TITLE

02:48:48.284 --> 02:48:50.220
MECHANISM.

02:48:50.286 --> 02:48:52.522
ON ONE HAND SAYING IN HIGH WATER

02:48:52.589 --> 02:48:54.324
EVENTS WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

02:48:54.390 --> 02:48:57.093
CAPTURE WHAT IS EXTRA.

02:48:57.160 --> 02:48:58.361
IT MORE THAN WHAT THE

02:48:58.428 --> 02:49:00.263
ENVIRONMENT NEEDS.

02:49:00.330 --> 02:49:02.365
AND IN LOW WATER EVENTS TRUSTING

02:49:02.432 --> 02:49:02.966
THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE

02:49:03.032 --> 02:49:04.601
PLACE.

02:49:04.667 --> 02:49:06.102
AND DIED IN SO.

02:49:06.169 --> 02:49:07.871
HOW HOW?

02:49:07.937 --> 02:49:10.073
QUICK IS THAT DECISION MAKING IN

02:49:10.139 --> 02:49:11.941
IN UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE

02:49:12.008 --> 02:49:13.543
ABLE TO CAPTURE MORE WHEN THOSE

02:49:13.610 --> 02:49:15.678
THINGS TAKE PLACE. AND A AND

02:49:15.745 --> 02:49:17.881
WHAT IS THE.

02:49:17.947 --> 02:49:19.382
KIND OF THE OF THE VERIFICATION

02:49:19.449 --> 02:49:21.451
OUR VALIDATION THAT THE TRUST

02:49:21.518 --> 02:49:23.887
BUILDING COMPONENT TO SAY THAT

02:49:23.953 --> 02:49:26.422
IN THE THE LOWER WATER EVENTS

02:49:26.489 --> 02:49:27.457
WHERE WE CAN'T ACTUALLY.

02:49:27.524 --> 02:49:29.025
.

02:49:29.092 --> 02:49:30.960
TRANSFER WATER BECAUSE OF THAT

02:49:31.027 --> 02:49:32.095
THE ECOSYSTEM.

02:49:32.161 --> 02:49:33.463
THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE

02:49:33.530 --> 02:49:34.864
PLACE HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THAT TO

02:49:34.931 --> 02:49:35.431
PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THOSE

02:49:35.498 --> 02:49:37.133
ISSUES.

02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:38.601
AND IN BOTH INSTANCES WHAT ONCE

02:49:38.668 --> 02:49:39.469
YOU DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:49:39.536 --> 02:49:40.603
WE'RE ABLE TO CAPTURE MORE

02:49:40.670 --> 02:49:42.138
MODERN AND OTHERS TO SAY. NO NO

02:49:42.205 --> 02:49:43.473
NO THAT'S THAT'S NOT I MEAN BOTH

02:49:43.540 --> 02:49:46.442
BOTH HAVE VALID POINTS.

02:49:46.509 --> 02:49:47.911
SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE MAJOR

02:49:47.977 --> 02:49:49.546
MAJOR CONSIDERATIONS AND THE

02:49:49.612 --> 02:49:50.780
BOARDS ESTABLISHMENT OF

02:49:50.847 --> 02:49:52.782
APPROPRIATE DELTA FLOW CRITERIA

02:49:52.849 --> 02:49:53.316
FOR THE OPERATIONS OF THE

02:49:53.383 --> 02:49:55.818
PROJECTS. WHICH WOULD LOOK AT

02:49:55.885 --> 02:49:57.387
ALL OF THOSE ISSUES AND WHAT

02:49:57.453 --> 02:49:59.489
FACTOR AND YOU KNOW AND THAT'S A

02:49:59.556 --> 02:50:00.757
DECISION THE BOARD HAVE THEM

02:50:00.823 --> 02:50:02.425
MADE GETS I CAN'T SPECIFICALLY

02:50:02.492 --> 02:50:04.894
SPEAK TO. EXACTLY WHAT THEY

02:50:04.961 --> 02:50:06.062
WOULD BE REQUIRING AS PART OF

02:50:06.129 --> 02:50:07.630
THAT DECISION BUT THE DELTA

02:50:07.697 --> 02:50:08.898
REFORM ACT.

02:50:08.965 --> 02:50:10.099
IT'S AN OBLIGATION ON THE BOARD

02:50:10.166 --> 02:50:11.701
TO ESTABLISH THAT AS CRITERIA IN

02:50:11.768 --> 02:50:13.570
ADDITION AS I MENTIONED THAT

02:50:13.636 --> 02:50:14.504
WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLANNING

02:50:14.571 --> 02:50:16.072
PROCESS IN OUR IMPLEMENTATION

02:50:16.139 --> 02:50:17.607
PROCESS I THINK ARE. ANOTHER

02:50:17.674 --> 02:50:19.742
MECHANISM THAT REQUIRE US TO

02:50:19.809 --> 02:50:20.843
INCH ENSURE THAT WE'RE

02:50:20.910 --> 02:50:22.612
PROTECTING THE BENEFICIAL USES

02:50:22.679 --> 02:50:24.314
AND MORE. YOU KNOW ENGAGED IN A

02:50:24.380 --> 02:50:26.049
PROCESS TO UPDATE THE BAY DELTA

02:50:26.115 --> 02:50:27.317
PLAN NOW.

02:50:27.383 --> 02:50:28.418
TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF

02:50:28.484 --> 02:50:30.653
BENEFICIAL USES OUT REGARDLESS

02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:32.155
OF WHETHER THE WATER FIX PROJECT.

02:50:32.221 --> 02:50:33.623
TAKE PLACE OR NOT AND I THINK

02:50:33.690 --> 02:50:35.525
THOSE FLOW OBLIGATIONS THAT COME

02:50:35.592 --> 02:50:37.160
OUT OF THAT REVIEW WILL BE

02:50:37.226 --> 02:50:39.295
APPLICABLES WHETHER THAT. WATER

02:50:39.362 --> 02:50:41.464
FIX PROJECT GOES IT GOES FORWARD

02:50:41.531 --> 02:50:43.800
OR NOT AND ADAM ARE CONTINUING

02:50:43.866 --> 02:50:44.901
OBLIGATION OF THE POURED INTO

02:50:44.968 --> 02:50:46.469
THE FUTURE AND SOMETHING YOU

02:50:46.536 --> 02:50:48.204
KNOW THAT WE'RE. WE'RE OBLIGATED

02:50:48.271 --> 02:50:50.173
TO LOOK AT ON A REGULAR BASIS SO

02:50:50.239 --> 02:50:51.240
I I THINK THOSE ARE THE

02:50:51.307 --> 02:50:53.743
MECHANISMS THAT YOU KNOW PROVIDE

02:50:53.810 --> 02:50:56.446
FOR. THAT THOSE ASSURANCES AND

02:50:56.512 --> 02:50:59.649
ALSO UNIT ADS EILEEN SPOKE TO.

02:50:59.716 --> 02:51:01.718
THE PORTS PROPHECIES ARE VERY

02:51:01.784 --> 02:51:08.925
PUBLIC THE BOARD THOUGH PUBLIC

02:51:08.992 --> 02:51:09.859
ALWAYS HAVE THEIR.

TO COMMENT AND PUBLIC FORUMS

02:51:11.561 --> 02:51:13.162
BEFORE THE BOARD MEMBER SO.

02:51:13.229 --> 02:51:14.530
I THINK FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE

02:51:14.597 --> 02:51:15.898
EVERYTHING CONCERNS BEFORE THE

02:51:15.965 --> 02:51:19.102
BOARD THE BOARD ITS UNIQUELY AND.

02:51:19.168 --> 02:51:21.204
FISH AND TO PROVIDE FOR THAT

02:51:21.270 --> 02:51:23.206
PUBLIC IN PLAY AND HEAR FROM THE

02:51:23.272 --> 02:51:24.540
PUBLIC IF THEY HAVE CONCERNS

02:51:24.607 --> 02:51:25.875
REGARDING OUR PROJECT AND HOW

02:51:25.942 --> 02:51:27.276
IT'S BEING OPERATED. WHAT

02:51:27.343 --> 02:51:28.311
SPECIFICALLY IS THE CRITERIA

02:51:28.378 --> 02:51:30.513
GOING TO BE DEVELOPED?

02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:32.281
THE CRITERIA WOULD BE PART OF

02:51:32.348 --> 02:51:33.416
THE DECISION THAT THE PORT

02:51:33.483 --> 02:51:35.151
ISSUES ON THE WATER RIGHT CHANGE

02:51:35.218 --> 02:51:37.620
PETITION. AND ALSO CONDITIONS

02:51:37.687 --> 02:51:39.022
WOULD LIKELY BE INCLUDED IT

02:51:39.088 --> 02:51:40.623
WOULD ALSO BE INCLUDED AND THE

02:51:40.690 --> 02:51:41.090
BOARDS.

02:51:41.157 --> 02:51:42.492
ISSUANCE OF A WATER QUALITY

02:51:42.558 --> 02:51:43.826
CERTIFICATION FOR THE PROJECT IF

02:51:43.893 --> 02:51:45.328
THE BOARD.

02:51:45.395 --> 02:51:46.562
CHOOSES TO APPROVE THE PROJECT

02:51:46.629 --> 02:51:48.831
SO. THOSE CONDITIONS WOULD BE

02:51:48.898 --> 02:51:51.134
LAID OUT IN THE A DRAFT ORDER

02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:52.402

THE SOLE SOLUTION AND YOU'LL SEE

03:13:00.702 --> 03:13:03.171

CALIFORNIANS IT'S TAKING AWAY

03:15:10.965 --> 03:15:12.534

TAINTED.

03:15:13.768 --> 03:15:15.070
THE CONSTRUCTION WILL A

03:15:15.136 --> 03:15:16.538
DESTROYER WELLS THERE IS A

03:15:16.604 --> 03:15:17.772
LITTLE TOWN THERE CALLED LOCK

THE NATIONAL HISTORIC REGISTER.

03:15:21.509 --> 03:15:22.811
IT WILL FALL BECAUSE OF THE

03:15:22.877 --> 03:15:24.712
CONSTRUCTION THE VIBRATION THE

03:15:24.779 --> 03:15:26.981
NOISE AT SAUDARA. AND ALSO WE

03:15:27.048 --> 03:15:28.483
RECENTLY LEARNED THROUGH I HAVE

THE DELTA THE IN THE LINE OF THE

03:15:37.926 --> 03:15:39.294
CONSTRUCTION THAT COULD.

03:15:39.360 --> 03:15:41.196
BE AFFECTED BY THIS WE HAVE

FOREST TRUST I JUST REALLY

03:15:55.677 --> 03:15:57.145
STRUCK DURING THE TESTIMONY OR

03:15:57.212 --> 03:15:59.514
DURING THE DISCUSSION EARLIER. A

03:15:59.581 --> 03:16:00.115
NUMBER OF PEOPLE MENTIONED IN

03:16:00.181 --> 03:16:01.116
OUR TALK ABOUT BILLIONS AND

03:16:01.182 --> 03:16:02.350
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HERE THERE'S

03:16:02.417 --> 03:16:03.751
NO NEW WATER WE'RE JUST

03:16:03.818 --> 03:16:05.420
INCREASING THE RELIABILITY OF

03:16:05.487 --> 03:16:07.489
MOVING WATER THAT SCENE ALL KIND

03:16:07.555 --> 03:16:08.423
OF OUR CURRENT.

03:16:08.490 --> 03:16:09.958
AMOUNT IT SEEMS CRAZY TALKING

03:16:10.024 --> 03:16:10.925
ABOUT MAKING THESE LEVELS OF

03:16:10.992 --> 03:16:13.595
INVESTMENTS WITHOUT ALSO. DOING

03:16:13.661 --> 03:16:15.630
MORE CONCERTED RESTORATION WORK

03:16:15.697 --> 03:16:17.365
IN OUR UPPER WATERSHEDS

03:16:17.432 --> 03:16:18.633
TO TRY AND GET BACK INTO MORE

03:16:18.700 --> 03:16:19.901
RESILIENT CONDITION OR WERE LESS

03:16:19.968 --> 03:16:22.270
SUBJECT TO LARGE FIRES LURE

03:16:22.337 --> 03:16:23.638
OTHER. EVENTS THE CAN DEGRADE

03:16:23.705 --> 03:16:25.573
WATER QUALITY BUT ALSO QUITE

03:16:25.640 --> 03:16:27.642
LIKELY COMPREHENSIVE RESTORATION

03:16:27.709 --> 03:16:29.244
THERE COULD LEAD TO MORE WATER

03:16:29.310 --> 03:16:30.311
AVAILABILITY.

03:16:30.378 --> 03:16:32.046
SO AND CERTAINLY COULD EXTEND

03:16:32.113 --> 03:16:33.515
THE TIMING OF WATER LATER INTO

03:16:33.581 --> 03:16:35.483
THE YEAR SO AS WATER IS FLOWING

03:16:35.550 --> 03:16:37.952
OUT INTO. JUNE JULY RATHER THAN

03:16:38.019 --> 03:16:39.354
ENDING IN MAY THAT'S THE

03:16:39.420 --> 03:16:41.456
EQUIVALENT OF MORE WATER

03:16:41.523 --> 03:16:43.458
AVAILABILITY SO. I REALLY

03:16:43.525 --> 03:16:44.592
ENCOURAGE US TO NOT LOSE TRACK

03:16:44.659 --> 03:16:45.994
OF THE FACT THE WATER ACTUALLY

03:16:46.060 --> 03:16:47.395
COMES FROM SOMEWHERE AND WE'D

03:16:47.462 --> 03:16:48.796
MAKE INVESTMENTS THERE AS WELL.

03:16:48.863 --> 03:16:50.298
I THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:16:50.365 --> 03:16:51.466

03:16:53.468 --> 03:16:54.936
MORE ON THAT WILL CONCLUDE OUR

03:16:55.003 --> 03:16:56.471
PUBLIC COMMENTS IN OUR HEARINGS

03:16:56.538 --> 03:16:57.839

AGAIN THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I

03:17:02.977 --> 03:17:04.045

03:17:13.855 --> 03:17:15.123
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

03:17:15.190 --> 03:17:15.823
