IS THAT GONNA TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES. OKAY THEY'RE CALLING YOU YOU CAN PROCEED BUT- JUST TRY TO KEEP YOUR VOICE UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I DON'T THINK THE PROBLEMS ON HERE AND THE- OKAY NOT ALL ALL TALK REALLY LOUD- IT'S DON'T DELUDE US. ABOUT OKAY IT'S NOT GIVING US REQUESTING A TOTAL OF FORTY MILLION TWO AND A HALF CALIFORNIA'S CAPACITY TO ISSUE A COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSES IS SIMPLY THIS FUNDING INCLUDES READ A HALF MILLION AND FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TO TWENTY MILLION AND TEN MILLION ANNUALLY- TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TO FIND THE THING COSTS ESTABLISH. DEDICATED COMMERCIAL CENTERS IN THE BAY AREA AND NORTHERN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. IN ADDITION THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES ONE POINT FUNDING OF SIX BILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR THE FUND OVERTIME ON SATURDAY. FOR LICENSING REGISTRATION EXAMINERS AND DOZENS ARE SUPPORT STAFF WHICH WILL BE DIRECTED TO OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT HAVE APPOINTMENT WAIT TIMES IN EXCESS OF. THIRTY DAYS. IT WILL ALSO FUND ASSOCIATED TRAVEL COSTS FOR STAFF AND FACILITIES BIRTH. WHAT THAT MISTER OUT RAPIDLY ANSWER ANY PERTAINING TO REQUEST. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS MR FONG- AND WE NEED TO HEAR FROM LA- ALSO MAYBE. THEY MIGHT ANSWER QUESTIONS SO. YEAH SORRY ABOUT THAT WELCOME. THANK YOU CHAIR EUNICE ROW AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE HAVE SEVERAL COMMENTS ON BOTH THAT PROPOSALS FOR THE SUPPLY CHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE ANTHER CAL SAYS WELL AS THE PROPOSAL FOR THE COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSES UNDER THE DMV MOST OF OUR COMMENTS I'LL JUST FOCUS ON SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES WE RAISED. OUR WITH REGARDS TO THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL FOR THIS. INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL UNDER CONSTANT. THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER SEVERAL ISSUES AND MODIFY THE PROPOSAL SO IT BEST ADDRESSES ITS PRIORITIES. FIRST THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THE ROLE OF THE STATE- AS- AS ADMINISTRATION MENTIONED THIS PROPOSAL WOULD REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT A ONE TIME INCREASE IN STATE FUNDING FOR GOODS MOVEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER WHAT THE ROLE STATE'S ROLE IS IN SUPPORTING- AND MAINTAINING THESE TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE. AS A GIVEN JUST A NUMBER OF OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE INVOLVED- SUCH AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PORT AUTHORITY IS IN FOR A ROLL IT COMPANIES. AND IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHAT THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE FUNDING SHOULD BE- IN ADDITION TO INCREASING GOODS MOVEMENT CAPACITY. THAT'S PROPOSAL IS INTENDED TO MEET SEVERAL OTHER GOALS- ACCORDING TO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AT INCLUDING REDUCING GHG ADMISSIONS- IN PROMOTING TRANSPORTATION EQUITY- THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE SCHOOLS REFLECT ITS PRIORITIES I'M AND- GIVEN THE LIMITED IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS TO LET MINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED IF ANY ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE IS NEEDED TO ENSURE FUNDING WILL BE ALLOCATED TO BEST MEET. THESE GOALS. AT THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER THE PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH THE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED THREO- FUNDING IS CURRENTLY PROPOSED TO BE ALLOCATED THROUGH A NEW PROGRAM UNDER CAL STEP BY EITHER EXISTING PROGRAMS FUND SIMILAR PROJECTS. AND COULD BE USED TO ALLOCATE THE PROPOSED FUNDING. AT THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER THE MERITS AND TRADE OFFS OF PROVIDING FUNDING FOR A NEW OR EXISTING PROGRAM. FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDING FUNDING THROUGH AN EXISTING PROGRAM MIGHT LEAD TO FASTER IMPLEMENTATION- AT EVEN IF SOME EXISTING GUIDELINES MAY. NEED TO BE CHANGED BUT ALTERNATELY A NEW PROGRAM MIGHT BE NEEDED IF AND THE INTENDED GOALS OR THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT ARE SHOULD BE PRIORITISED DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE EXISTING PROGRAM. ANOTHER ISSUE TO CONSIDER IS THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE FUNDING AT AS PROPOSED 70% OF THE FUNDING IS DEDICATED TO PROJECTS AT THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH. BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE GOODS MOVEMENT IN THE STATE AB OCCURS IN THIS REGION. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE ALSO MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF PORTS AND PORT INFRASTRUCTURE STATEWIDE TO ENSURE THE NEEDS OF SMALLER INLAND PORTS ARE ALSO- MET WITH THE AVAILABLE FUNDING- AND FINALLY AT- DELICIOUS. THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER IT A REQUIREMENT CAL STATE TO REPORT. THE FUNDING OUTCOMES AND ON GOING NEEDS OF IN THE GOODS MOVE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE WHETHER ANY ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING IS NECESSARY I'M IN THE FUTURE- WITH REGARDS TO THE DMV PROPOSAL- WE HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS- FIRST WE RECOMMEND THE PROPOSAL BE FUNDED THROUGH THE NBA AND INSTEAD OF THE GENERAL FUND AT THE COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED. AT BUT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSAL ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PROCESSING OF COMMERCIAL DRIVE TESTS WHICH THE STATE COLLECTS A FEE TO SUPPORT. AND SECOND WE RECOMMEND- TO REQUIRE ONGOING FUND REPORTING TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHETHER INCREASED WAIT TIMES FOR COMMERCIAL DRIVE TEST WILL BE AN ONGOING OR ONE TIME ISSUE- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL DRIVER LICENSES WOULD ALLOW. THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE IF- ONE ON GOING FUNDING FOR A COMMERCIAL DRIVE TEST CENTRES IS NEEDED BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS WERE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE. APPARENTLY NOT- MR PONG. BUT I THINK THIS CHAIR- IN WITH THE WITH THE GUARDS TO THE FUNDING TO ADDRESS THE SUPPLY CHAIN CONGESTION CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT OF- INVESTMENT THAT IS GOING THROUGH MULTIPLE AGENCIES CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT ON HOW THE COORDINATION IS WORKING WITHIN THE AGENCIES WHO'S GONNA BE THE AGENCY OR THE LEAD AGENCY TO CONTACT THE STAKEHOLDERS SUPPLY CHAIN TO ENSURE THAT THE RESOURCES SPENT- IN A WAY THAT. RELIEVES CONGESTION AND ACTUALLY HARDENS IS A PROJECT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MR FONG. OF SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL REALLY INTO AFRICA ALSO TO SERVE AS THE LEAD AGENCY IN COORDINATING ISSUES RELATED TO SUPPLY CHAIN IMPORT ANIMAL THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA RIGHT NOW TO WILL BE DISCUSSING IS ACTUAL ACTUALLY CONTAINS A BROADER RESOURCE REQUESTS FROM THE AGENCY- TO ESTABLISH A- SUPPLY CHAIN AND- AFRAID POLICY. OVERSIGHT TEAM AND SO- YOU KNOW THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS REALLY TO HELP COORDINATE BETTER COORDINATE- YOU KNOW THE END RESULT FRAZIER PLACING.ISSUES- WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION. THIS US OF CAL'S IS THE LEAD AGENCY. HOW DOES GOBIZ INTERACT WITH THAT SAYS IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF RESOURCES AND A LOT OF THE POLICY DECISIONS ARE BEING GOING TO COPE IS. HOW HOW IS THAT COORDINATION OCCURRING. ONE HUNDRED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE- GILES GYMNASTICS. SIR JOHNSON NOT EASY ADVISER CALLAS DE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO WE MAKE FOR LAST YEAR LISA LAST YEAR WE REPORTED A VERY CLOSE IN THE KOBE IS- WE'VE WORKED WITH THEM ON THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN SUCCESS INITIATIVE WE WERE PARTNER- WOULD THAT WAS PUT. TOGETHER BY GOBIZ IN CALLOUSED AND CSU LONG BEACH IN THE PORT OF LONG BEACH THE KIND OF EXPORT FROM POLICY ISSUES WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS THIS MONTH OF CERTAIN ABLE STEPPING OUT AND KIND OF WORKING ACCORDING ALREADY COORDINATING WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS GOVERNMENTS FRESNO COG. ALL WILL BE WORKING WITH MTC REPORT OF- PORT OF OAKLAND AND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DO A SERIES OF LISTENING SESSIONS TO GET INPUT ON ON OUR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND ALSO ADDITIONAL INPUT ON DEVELOPING GUIDELINES FOR PROGRAM SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE- SEE FIT TO- TO- TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL GOLD IS HAS BEEN VERY INVOLVED WITH US IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF. COORDINATING THESE LISTENING SESSIONS THEY'VE BEEN PART OF OUR KIND OF COMMITTEE TO- TO- TO- TO. PUT TOGETHER THE H. AND SO AND PARTY. TO GIVE US GIVEN THE LISTINGS. IN WE WILL. CONTINUE TO COORDINATE VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM WITH THEM THROUGHOUT- THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANY CRITERIA OR GUIDELINES. FOR THIS PROGRAM SIR OKAY. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR CALLOUS THAT IS THE LEAD AGENCY WHEN IT COMES TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN POLICIES FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION. YES OKAY- AND SO IN IN IN A LOT OF THAT- THE GOVERNOR I BELIEVE- WHAT HE DID SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ALLEVIATE THE SUPPLY CHAIN CONGESTION THE CONGESTION AND THEN HE IDENTIFIED. SURPLUS PROPERTY- FOR ADDITIONAL CONTAINER STORAGE- WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THAT. CAN YOU CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT. SO CERTAINLY DGS IS THE LEAD AGENCY IN TERMS OF COORDINATING THE ESTATE OWNED PROPERTIES FOR CONTAINERS AS I UNDERSTAND WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STAFF- FOR MORE DETAILS BUT I THINK THEY IDENTIFIED SIX- THERE USING A THIRD PARTY- JUNKER AND THEY'VE IDENTIFIED I THINK SIX SIX STATE OWNED PROPERTIES- BUT THAT'S ALL THE DETAIL I HAVE AT THIS TIME BUT- WE CAN WE CAN FOLLOW THE DGS. SO I HAVE TO SAY THIS YOU AT THE PREVIOUS QUESTION YOU SAID. YOU'RE THE LEAD AGENCY ON SUPPLY CHAIN. YOU JUST SAID NOW DGS IS THE LEAD AGENCY ON THIS- CONTAINER STORAGE- PROPOSAL TO ALLEVIATE THE PLEDGING CONGESTION SO WHO IS THE LEAD AGENCY. SO SIR DO OUT OF THE- THROUGHOUT DETERMINES. AFTER THE GOVERNOR SIGNED EXECUTIVE ORDER AND NINETEEN TWENTY ONE- THERE WAS A MULTI AGENCY TASK FORCE THAT WAS TASKED WITH KIND OF LOOKING AT NEAR TERM. AND LONG TERM OPERATIONAL ISSUES- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAD BEEN DOING THE COORDINATION- THROUGH IT TO A MULTI AGENCY TASK FORCE IN WHICH CALTRANS HAD LEADERSHIP ROLES RIGHT IN WHICH THAT HOUSE THAT HAD A LEADERSHIP ROLE- BUT- CERTAIN AGENCIES WITH DIFFERENT SPECIALIZATIONS. WERE GIVEN DIFFERENT- ASSIGNED SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIESWITH REGARD TO- WITH REGARD TO THE THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER GUARD SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS AND STATE OWNED PROPERTIES- WAS ASSIGNED TO A D. G. S. JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR OF THEIR- THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING AND- ALLEN ST IN STATE PROPERTIES. A SO THEN WHO ARE KALISTO ISN'T. OF COORDINATING ALL THIS IS IT IS IT THE DIRECTOR. THOUGHTLESSNESS THE SECRETARY'S BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN ALL THIS IS A HIDDEN AND IS THE EXECUTIVE. MANAGEMENT TEAM- THE UNDERSECRETARY MYSELF- SO OKAY I'M I'M NOT I'M NOT MAKING I'M NOT TRYING TO BE DIFFICULT I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK THIS IS THE CHALLENGE I THINK WITH THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUE IS THAT. WHEN THERE'S A LOT AGENCIES INVOLVED IN AYE I'LL AYE DEADLY STIPULATE THAT BIG BIG THE CONCERN I HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THAT AS YOU JUST OUTLINED IN OUR INTERACTION IS AT THE CORE NATION IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND SO IF THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT HANDER THAN WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND SO IF CALCITE IS THE LEAD AGENCY. AND THE SECRETARY IS THE ONE COORDINATING THEN EVERYTHING SHOULD FLOW TO THAT. AGENCY SO IF WERE TOUTING. A NO THERE IS DEFINITELY A NEED FOR THESE THE SURPLUS PROPERTY AND WE'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS INLAND PORTS AND WE'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS IN THE PORT OF LA IN THE PORT OF LONG BEACH. SOMEONE'S GONNA KNOW AND COORDINATE ALL THAT AND SO IT DGS IS NOW IN CHARGE OF THE SURPLUS- LAND POLICY. AND A YEAR IN CHARGE OF THE OF THE OF THE INVESTMENTS IN THE PORT AND GOBIZ IS NOW IN CHARGE OF- ACCORDING TO THE- THE FREIGHT AND THE EXPORT POLICY OF THE STATE CALIFORNIA. IT'S GOING TO FLOW SOMEWHERE. AND SO I'M JUST ASKING WHO THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER IS IF ALL THIS IS HAPPENING BECAUSE WE'RE INVESTING A LOT OF MONEY INTO THIS AND I BELIEVE WE NEED TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS- NOW TO- TO THE- PORT SPECIFIC PROJECTS- HAVE. IS THERE ARE THOSE PROJECTS FORTY OUTLINED DO YOU HAVE A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT ALREADY IN THE DOCKET WAITING TO GO. WHAT ARE THOSE PROJECTS. SO SIR- WE WHAT THE WAY WE WOULDN'T GO ABOUT AS WE TRIED TO PUT OUT A CALL FOR PROJECTS AS SOON AS WE WERE AWARDED FUNDING- WHY ARE WE ANTICIPATED THAT A NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD COME FORWARD- WOULD PROBABLY BE IN THE CALIFORNIA FREIGHT MOBILITY PLAN. WHICH IS A PLAN THAT OUTLINES VARIOUS PROJECTS FOR A FOR A FEDERAL INVESTMENT. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT AND WERE AGAIN ABOUT TO EMBARK ON A NUMBER OF LISTENING SESSIONS WHERE WITH. LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THEY ARE BAY MORTY TAKEN WOMEN WE KNOW THAT THEY'VE ALREADY TAKEN A CLOSE LOOK AT OUR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- THE GOALS THAT. WE'VE OUTLINED IN OUR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- AS WELL AS THE NOTICES OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITY THEM THAT APPETITE FOR BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY U. S. DOT FOR VARIOUS GRANT PROGRAMS. THAT WE'RE TRYING TO LEVERAGE AND- THEY'VE ALREADY STARTED THINKING THROUGH AND IDENTIFYING TYPE PROJECTS THAT THEY MAY WANT TO COME FORWARD. AND BEEN PUT FORWARD AS- AS CANDIDATES FOR FUNDING SO THIS TYPE OF WHAT WE DON'T HAVE A LIST OF PROJECTS WE WOULD PUT OUT A CALL FOR PROJECTS. OFFER COMPETITIVE FOR COMPETITIVE BID BUT- BUT SAID THIS TYPE OF THINKING IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT MIGHT ALIGN WITH THESE GOALS AS WELL AS FEDERAL PROGRAMS HAVE SIMILAR ALREADY BEING DEVELOPED BY SOME OF THE MAJOR STAKE WASN'T PUTTING THE POINTS AVAILABLE. OKAY SO YOU'RE SO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A CALL FOR PROJECTS AND THEN DEVELOP THAT LIST- THAT CORRECT. YES SIR OKAY- IN TERMS OF THE- DATA PORTAL- I THINK THERE'S THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME. FOR GO VISIT DEVELOP THAT STATEWIDE DATA PORTAL- THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE EXISTING TERMINAL OPERATOR PLATFORMS. SO HOW DOES THAT INTERACT WITH WHAT. WHAT YOU'RE DOING. ALL THE FIRST SOMETHING LIKE IT ALWAYS AN ALTOGETHER A LITTLE SHOT OF THAT SO GO VISIT BE THE LEAD ON DEVELOPING THAT PROGRAM AND THAT- AND THAT- YOU KNOW PROCUREMENT OR WHATEVER THEY WOULD DO THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE EFFORTS THAT THEY CAN KIND OF LOOK AT THE- TOP WITH GO BIZ AND COORDINATING WITH THEM WE WERE ALL WATCHING VARIOUS FEDERAL EFFORTS THAT ARE GOING ON AROUND THIS I THINK THERE WAS A- A U. S. T. O. C. PROPOSAL OUT BLANK ON THE NAME RIGHT NOW OR SORRY A- THE PILOT PROGRAM THAT WAS PUT TOGETHER. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO- THE FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION IS DOING AND I'M GOING SORT OF FACT FINDING INTO OF DATA FOR NATION AND SHARING SO IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WATCHING IT SOMETHING GO BUSINESS BEEN WATCHING WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT WITH THEM SHARING INFORMATION- BUT AGAIN GOMEZ WOULD BE OF THE LEAD ON SORT OF ANY TYPE OF. INFORMATION SHARING OR PROCUREMENTS OR ANYTHING THAT WOULD KALRA GO ON. WITH THAT WITH THAT- WITH THAT PROPOSAL. OKAY THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT- WE HAD- THIS DISCUSSION IN THE SELECT BOARD'S COMMITTEE- AT THIS PLATFORM IS CRITICAL. TO CONNECTING ALL THE PORTS IT HAS TO BE INTEROPERABLE- WE NEED FOR A CAR WELL AS I A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE SO THAT EVERYONE USES IT. WE GOT INCLUDE- THE RAIL OPERATORS IN THE TRUCKING OPERATORS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY- GOOD COORDINATION AND FOLLOW. SO THAT WE CAN RELIEVE CONGESTION AT THE PORTS IN. AND MOVE GOODS TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO AND TRACK THINGS IN REAL TIME- YOU KNOW YOU'RE USING PHRASES LIKE. KOBE'S IS THE LEAD IN. AND AGAIN- I'M I'M- USING YOUR- YOUR VERNACULAR. IS THAT IF CAL STATE IS THE LEAD AGENCY. THEN YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING- IF GOBIZ IS THE LEAD AND- MY AND EVERYTHING I'M SEEING IS THAT THE- DIRECTOR OF GO BASIS BEEN THE PUBLIC FACE OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN CONGESTION- ISSUE. AND SO. IF I'M I'M GETTING MIXED SIGNALS HERE. OF WHO IS ACTUALLY IN CHARGE- AND AGAIN- MY I AM DURING THE ADMINISTRATION YOU. TO DEVELOP THAT'S- THAT STRUCTURE- SO THAT WHEN WE DO INVEST. THESE RESOURCES INTO THE SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS. WHICH HAS TO BE RESOLVED. THAT THAT. OCCURS I GUESS MY QUESTION TO THE L. A. O. IS- YOU IT IN. IN EUROPE. THAT A LOT OF THESE- THE INVESTMENTS ARE GOING TO- THAT ANYMORE DETAILS TO ENSURE THAT IN IN THE LONG RUN THE SHORT RUN THAT WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGES THAT THAT MAY NEED TO- TO BE FLESHED OUT. HOW IS THE COORDINATION RIGHT NOW WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN WITH A STRUCTURE WITHIN ADMINISTRATION QUESTION I AM UNITS ARE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I THINK IT'S A LOT OF IT IS AN INFLUX AND THEY THINK THAT'S IN PART WHY THEY'RE THERE IS KIND OF THE ADDITIONAL CASH PROPOSAL FOR UNDER KALISTO TWO FOR THE FREIGHT POLICY TEAM AND SO. AND IT DOES SEEM THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME DETERMINATIONS MADE TO COURTNEY- FROM THE ADMINISTRATION SIDE AS WELL ABOUT WHO IS. FACILITATING ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES. HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THE- THE SURPLUS- DAN PROPOSAL DO YOU HAVE ANY. GUIDANCE OR- INPUT ON THAT. WHICH I PURPOSE THERE THERE WAS A BUT THERE'S OUT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER TO- THAT IDENTIFIED SURPLUS PROPERTY FOR ADDITIONAL CONTAINER STORAGE HAVE YOU GOTTEN A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THAT. AT I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE ON THAT ONE A QUESTION OKAY YOUR FIRST BOB POINT- THAT YOU INDICATED IN YOUR TESTIMONY IS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE ALLEN WHAT THE STATE ROLE IS. DO YOU HAVE A RECOMMENDATION AND WHAT SHOULD THE STATES WILL BE IN TERMS OF THE PORT INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES. I MEAN I DON'T THINK IT'S A IT'S A MATTER OF IT HOW IT RANKS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES STRAIGHT SO HISTORICALLY THE STATE HAS NOT PLAYED A LARGE ROLE IN SUPPORTING- INFRASTRUCTURE SO. INCREASING AND STATE THAT ROLE BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD BE SHOWING KIND OF HOW IMPORTANT SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES ARE FOR THE LEGISLATURE CURRENTLY OKAY. OF MY LAST POINT INTO IT- THE DECALS- IF YOU COULD PROVIDE ME AN UPDATE ON. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE SURPLUS PROPERTY AT B. THAT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT AND OF COURSE IF YOU COULD DEVELOP OR GIVE PROVIDE ME WITH. THE LATEST- ACTIONS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN- CONGESTION ISSUE I WOULD PUSH APPRECIATE AN UPDATE. ON THAT. AS WELL AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER THE- THANK YOU MR FONG- LET ME- ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON THE- THE ISSUE OF THE LOCATION OF. A CONTAINERS AND THAT A DETERMINATION OF SITES- THE THAT WAS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY- HOW ARE YOU GOING TO- OR IS THERE A PLAN TO AVOID. LOCATING ALL OF THESE SITES ADJACENT TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHICH HAS- UP IN SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT FOR QUITE SOME TIME- IN THE- AFTERMATH OF THE- OF PORK EMERGENCY THAT- EMERGE DURING THE- PANDEMIC- WE KNOW THAT LOCATIONS HAD TO BE FOUND. IMMEDIATELY AND QUICKLY FOR- AFTER ALL THESE ACCESS CONTAINERS BUT NOW WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT- AND THINK THIS THROUGH CAREFULLY- HOW ARE YOU GOING ABOUT DOING THAT. SO AGAIN BUT CERTAIN YOU NEED YES OUT ILLEGAL WE HAVE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH WITH THEM ON THIS BASED ON WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD BY THE G. S. THEY'RE ENTERING INTO- ONE YEAR LEASES AND THEIR MEETING MONTHLY WITH THEIR CONTRACT THE THIRD PART PARTY OPERATOR JUNKER. JUST RESOLVED- THE TWO DIDN'T RESOLVE ANY ISSUES THAT MIGHT ARISE OR TO MONITOR WHAT'S GOING ON A MIGHT ARISE WITH THE WITH THE SIZING SELECTED- AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND AGAIN WE WILL BEGIN CONCORD NAY WITH THE G. S. AND COME UP WITH A RESPONSE OR GET ADDITIONAL DATA- BUT THE SIDES THAT WERE SELECTED. SOME OF THEM ARE FAIRGROUNDS OR SOME OF THEM ARE FAIRLY FAIRLY REMOTE OR ALREADY HEAVILY TRAFFIC TRAFFIC FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND BUT WE CAN WE CAN CERTAINLY COORDINATE WITH DGS TO TRYING GET A BETTER RESPONSE. I ABSOLUTELY THINK THAT YOU SHOULD pBE DOING THAT- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE RECEIVED A LOT OF FEEDBACK ON AND- I WOULD THINK THAT- YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD SOME OF THAT TOO AND- AGAIN- THE- JUST- RELATING BACK TO- OF MR FONG. SAID- COMMENTS. OUR OUR OUR OUR- IT IS QUESTION. ASK HAVE YOU OR SHOULD WE BASS IT OF COORDINATE AND GET BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. THE OF PROPOSAL ADDRESSES LONG TERM INFRASTRUCTURE- DOES THE PROPOSAL ADDRESS IMMEDIATE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES AS WELL. SO SERVE UNDER EXECUTIVE- ORDER AND NINETEEN TWENTY ONE- THERE WAS A MULTI- INTERGOVERNMENTAL TASK FORCE THAT ADDRESS BOTH SHORT TERM AND- A NUMBER OF SHORT TERM STEPS YOU WOULD YOU WOULD MENTION STATE OWNED FACILITIES FOR CONTAINER YARDS AND THEIR NUMBER OF OTHER SHORT TERM ACTIONS THAT THAT THAT THE STATE TOOK- ANYTHING CAN TO CONTINUING TO TAKE. INCLUDING INCREASING CAPACITY I THINK BMB BASICALLY DOUBLE THE CAPACITY FOR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSES IN THE SHORT TERM- THERE BEEN INCREASES OF CALTRANS IT INCREASED- TRUCK WAITS FOR SHE'LL CONTAINERS FROM PORTS TO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS SO THESE ARE EXAMPLES OF- THE KINDS OF SHORT TERM ACTIONS THAT THE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS. TAKEN UNDER THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. SO I AM THERE'S ENOUGH OF METRICS- THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT LIKE HOW MANY SHIPS ARE IN TRANSIT HOW MANY HERE ANCHORED- OFF OF- OF THE PORTS HW MANY CONTAINERS ARE SITTING EMPTY- YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT IS THERE A- A WEBSITE THAT ONE CAN GO TO- VIEW THOSE. METRICS AND HOW THEY'RE CHANGING IN REAL TIME IT. SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT WAS THE VERY USEFUL. ALSO I KNOW THAT THE WATER SO WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING THAT TYPE OF DATA AND OF COURSE AND THINGS LIKE THAT THE- SHIPS AT ANCHOR OUTSIDE THE SAN PEDRO BAY HAVE GONE DOWN DRAMATICALLY SINCE THE FALL I CAN BLAST CINEMATICS I SAW WAS. FROM THE DOZENS THAT WE WERE SEEING THAT WE'RE SEEING LAST FALL TO. YOUR ADAM TWO WEEKS AGO I THINK WAS LIKE FOUR FOUR SHIPS ANCHORED THERE BUT ALL THE POLICIES OF AND PUT IN PLACE TO SORT OF- SLOW STEAMING TIME ETCETERA BUT- A LOT OF THAT SO WHY DON'T WE SEE METRICS LIKE THAT WE TRACK METRICS LIKE THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE STATE IS PUTTING OUT A PUBLIC. I HAVE A PUBLIC PORTAL AND I KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE WHITE HOUSE SUPPLY CHAIN DOT TASK FORCE HAS BEEN I THINK EITHER BI WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BEEN PUTTING OUT SOME OF THE STATISTICS THERE HAVE BEEN THERE HAS BEEN A- SIGNIFICANT DROP IN- CONTAINERS. UNDER CONTAINERS AT THE PORTS OF LA AND LONG BEACH HAVE BEEN TRACKED SO I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PUBLIC FACING WEBSITES OR BLOGS PARTICULAR ON THE FEDERAL SIDE THEY'RE SORT TRACKING THESE METRICS- AND THEN AND WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN ALSO. THE TRUMP TRACKING CERTAIN THINGS AS WELL AND MAY BE. ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THANK YOU AND THEN- HAVE.

I THANK YOU AS CHAIR I HATE TO SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD BUT- WITH THIS NEW PROPOSAL THERE IS A FREE COORDINATOR AND GOBIZ SO HOW DOES THAT HOW DO THOSE TWO INTERACT. THE REQUESTED RESOURCES WOULD WORK TO COORDINATE ALL OF THE ISSUES ACROSS ALL THE AGENCIES THAT HAVE ANY SORT OF ROLE IN OVERSEEING THE FREIGHT RIGHT NOW ALL SEE AND STATE. SO- YOU KNOW WHEN WE BELIEVE IN THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES WELL SUITED TO FILL THIS ROLE AS THE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING ALL THE OVERSIGHT FOR TRANSPORTATION ISSUES. SO IS THERE DUPLICATION OR- WOMAN WOULD YOU JUST. WOULD WOULD YOU ROLL THE GOBIZ POSITION INTO THIS. INTO THIS- FRAMEWORK OR INTO THIS- THIS ENTITY SERVER AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO COORDINATE VERY CLOSELY WITH KOBE'S AND WE'VE HAD A VERY STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM WE FEEL I GO BACK I MEAN CLEARLY WE WOULD NEED THAT THEY BRING DIFFERENT THINGS TO THE TABLE THAT WE WOULD WANT TO HAVE TO INCLUDE THEM IN ON YOU KNOW THINGS WE'RE DOING WITH OUR COURT WAY FOR NATION FOR EXAMPLE OF RELATIONSHIPS I MEAN I THINK IT'S SPRING TO CAL STATE HAS IS THAT WE OVERSEE DEPARTMENTS. THE DIRECTLY OPERATED SECTIONS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN INCLUDING CALTRANS CALIFORNIA PARTNER TRANSPORTATION OPERATE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM WHICH IS THE BACKBONE YOU HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF VEHICLES WHICH IS HERE WITH US TODAY WHICH DOES A LOT OF LICENSING REGULATION OF A VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN SO THAT I THINK WE'RE WELL POSITIONED TO KIND OF HAVE THIS TYPE OF ROLE BUT THEN GOBIZ ALSO HAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH PRIVATE SECTOR BUSINESSES RETAILERS FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN BIG VCOS RETAILERS- YOU KNOW WE NEED THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND THEY DEAL WITH THEM ON ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT- IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VENUES NOT JUST NOT JUST A SUPPLY CHAIN SO. WE WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH GO BIZ AS WE HAVE A FOR THE LAST YEAR OR SO AND- AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM IN VALUE IN A PARTNERSHIP. OKAY MY LOOK I NOT AS A- I. THAT THIS I THIS NEW STRUCTURE I MEAN HOW IS THERE GONNA BE BETTER COORDINATION. I COULD JUST SAY I DON'T REMEMBER JUST OF MY EXPERIENCE I FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN BETTER COORDINATION IN THE LAST AND THE LAST YEAR THAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON THIS ON THIS CRISIS. WE WOULD HAVE MORE STAFF AND RESOURCES TO BRING TO BEAR TO SUPPORT THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO DO A PARTNERSHIP THE BILL IS A GOOD EXAMPLE TIED TO GET EXACT SPECIFIC EXAMPLES. THE SUPPLY CHAIN SUCCESS INITIALLY BUT WE CO SPONSORED THE BILL BECAUSE WE- WE NEEDED FUNDING. YEAH WE DID WE REQUESTING THIS RESEARCH FUNDING TO SUPPLYING TO SUPPORT INITIATIVES LIKE THAT WHICH WE WERE NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT- QUICKLY OF YOUR EXISTING BUDGET. WE JUST EMBARKED ON A- A- YEAR LONG YOUR HOUSE LONG STUDYING AGRICULTURAL TRUCKING- WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF UP WITH BERKELEY AND UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA AND WHICH KOBE IS A CO SPONSOR TO THIS RESEARCH- BUT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO FIND A FULL SCALE BETWEEN HAVE THE FUNDING. BUT I GUESS IN BOTH EXAMPLES THIS WILL BE AN EXAMPLE OF HAVING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. FOR JOINT WORK WHERE WE WOULDN'T WORK WITH PARTNER AGENCIES LIKE GOAL IS- IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD SO AGAIN THIS ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AND RESOURCES. WILL HELP US TO WORK IN AN INTERAGENCY LEVEL IN SUPPORT OF INTERAGENCY RESEARCH AND OTHER AND OTHER. AND OTHER AND OTHER ITEMS. NOW I WANTED TO BRING UP SOMETHING THAT YOU MENTIONED YOU CHAIR OF COURSE IT I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO HAVE A- A PUBLIC FACING- REAL TIME CHART OR OUR- WEBSITE THAT ALLOWS. FOLKS TO KNOW HOW MANY SHIPS RIDING IN THEM WHAT WHAT THE CONGESTION IS IN THE PORT WHAT WAS THE NUMBER THAT YOU HAD OF THE CONGESTION. AT THE PORT OF LA AND LONG BEACH. I MISSED-THAT. SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I GOT THAT. I SO I I'VE SEEN. MATH WITH THE DIFFERENT MEASURES BEING YOU I MEAN I IT'S STACK HANGER. LOITERING LIVE SAUCE METRICS THAT IDEAL CLEAR WE WILL BE WAS ALL. NEWS IN THE FALL. OF BOY ANKH WAS IN THE DOES IT. I'D SEEN SOME- THAT MEASURE SAYING IF DOWN UNDER. TEN I. IMAGES OF MY- BUT INCLUDES- A LOT OF- AND- IN IN LONGWELL CONTAIN. AT THE POINTS OUT OF LA IN LONG BEACH OR THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. DECLINE OKAY. I HAVE BEEN FROM FROM THIS MERCHANTS SAYS THAT THEY TWENTY NINE SHIPS. AND THEN OF COURSE THERE ARE TWENTY NINE MORE SHIPS. THAT ARE- LOAD RATING OFF THAT FURTHER OUT TWENTY SIX- TO THE TWENTY CONTAINERSHIPS ARE THREE INCLUDES THREE CONTAINERSHIPS OFF THE PORT. AND THEN THERE'S TWENTY SIX VOLUNTARILY SLOWING THEIR SPEED- HE SAID YEAH I'M TRYING TO. MAKE THE ISSUE I GUESS IS THAT. WHY ARE THERE DIFFERENT NUMBERS. IF EVERYONE IS TRACKING THE SAME THING I GUESS IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND LIKE WHAT THE ACTUAL CONGESTION IS IT'S NOT LIKE WE ARE MISS COUNTING IT SHIPS OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA. WELL AND I DON'T WANT TO SUGGEST CERTAIN THE CONGESTION THAT THE SUPPLY CHAIN CONGESTION ISSUE IS UNSOLVED- I'M JUST SAYING THAT THE MEANT THAT LOOKING AT VARIOUS METRICS THERE- THERE HAVE BEEN. INDICATORS OF IMPROVEMENT AND THAT COULD BE THE OTHER DISCREPANCIES IN HOW WE'RE DEFINING AN ANCHOR OR OR SLOW STEAMING OR OR OR WHAT HAVE YOU- BUT WE CAN CIRCLE BACK TO YOUR STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE THAT- THAT- THE NEW UNDERSTAND THE METRICS WERE WERE WERE DESCRIBING. RIGHT AT THE VERY THANK YOU. M. A. GIVE THAT WAS OF THE POINTS I WAS TRYING TO MAKE GIRL. IS THAT THE SITUATION IS. DYNAMIC IT CHANGES ON A DAILY BASIS- AND FOR SOME. GOOD REASONS I'M SURE- IN FACT I THINK IT'S SALUTARY THAT- WE'VE- CHANGE THE DYNAMIC SO THAT- FEWER SHIPS ARE SIMPLY ANCHORING AND RUNNING THEIR ENGINES THEIR DIESEL ENGINES IN THE PORT WHICH WAS AFFECTING COASTAL CITIES- AND- WE'VE DONE THAT BY SLOWING DOWN THE- OF TRANSPORTATION BUT THAT DOESN'T. WAIT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE- ONE MIGHT ASSUME BY THE FACT THAT THERE'S FEWER SHIPS IN THE PORT THAT THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN SOME FASHION AND- THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT YOU WOULD NOT NECESSARILY READ INTO THAT. SO A MEANS OF GETTING THAT INFORMATION ON A DYNAMIC BASIS WOULD BE GREAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU IN I AM I APPRECIATE IN THE NEED FOR THIS AND IN TERMS OF CREATING IT- WHEN YOU HAVE VARIOUS AGENCIES ALL HAVING PARTS OF THE PROBLEM IT IS GREAT TO HAVE COORDINATION MY QUESTION IS TWO FOLD ONE WILL THIS BE AN N. A TEAM THAT ACTUALLY TAKES THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ME AS A AND SAY WHAT IS IT WILL THIS TEAM BE SORT OF IN THE LEADERSHIP POSITION THAT AY YOU MENTIONED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- WHAT I BOARD WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN IS TWO YEARS FROM NOW HAVE SAY. OKAY WHAT'S GOING ON AND WE STILL SAY THERE'S NO ONE ONE PLACE IN CHARGE WHERE WE CAN SAY WHO IS THE ULTIMATE COORDINATOR OF THIS- AS YOU GO FORWARD IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE QUESTION IS DOES THIS COORDINATION DEAL WITH FREIGHT POLICY ONLY OR DOES IT ALSO INCLUDE ALL OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO BE TAKING PLACE ON THE PORCH WILL THIS TEAM BE BE THE COORDINATOR OF THAT ALSO. THANK YOU. FRAZIER ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M YES I VISIBLE WOULD ESTABLISH IN THE TEAM AND HOUSE THAT TO BE THE LEAD ON ALL OF THE FREIGHT ISSUES IN THE STATE SO WE WOULD BE THE UNIT THAT WOULD BE CONTACTED WITH ANY QUESTIONS AND WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR RESPONDING TO ANY ANY REQUESTS BY THE LEGISLATURE OR OTHER STAKEHOLDERS- AS FAR AS THE SECOND QUESTION. IS CONCERNED. IT'S ONE. OF THE SENATE YOU WERE THE SECOND. POLICE ARE. IT IS WHAT WILL THE TEAM BE THE LEAD ON HAULER OR ALL WHEN OF ALL OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE AT THE PORTS THAT WE HAVE ALL THESE VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES YOU KNOW CARB IS INVOLVED YOU KNOW OF A BUSINESS- CALTRANS INVOLVED TO GO BIZ EVERYBODY IS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE TAKE PLACE OF THE PORTS WILL THIS TEAM BE THE LEAD ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS ALSO. IT IS LIKE AN ALTERNATE OVER TO OF I CALL THE G. DEPUTY SAID. OR RELIGION ON CHINA'S. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT A QUESTION SIR- OUR AGENCY HAS- A NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE. INVOLVEMENT IN PROJECTS THAT THAT THAT SERVE THE CHORDS. AND SO WE CERTAINLY HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE YOU KNOW DIRECTLY OR AGENCY THAT IS. WORKING TOGETHER. WITH THE COURT INVESTMENTS. IS THERE ARE OTHER STATE AGENTS THAT IN. IN INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL. THE THING THAT- REALLY BREAK FROM OUR AGENCY BECAUSE THAT A LOT OF THAT FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WE ARE SEEING IS IN THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES ON THE FEDERAL SIDE. AND WE ARE WE HAVE A VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AGAIN WOULD BE HELPING TO COORDINATE THE PURSUE THE FEDERAL FUNDING- TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN APPLYING MONEY TO SOME OF THOSE IN PROJECTS AND SO. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I'M THAT WE SEE THIS EVALUATE HAPPENING. ON THAT BET THAT THE TEAM HERE AT THE AGENCY. WOULD THE TEAM BE THE LEAD ON ASIA STRUCTURE PROJECTS ADDED THAT IN QUITE CATCH THAT IN THE ANSWERS TEAM TO BE THE LEADER WORKING WITH. OTHER AGENCIES BUT NOT IN THE LEAD. YEAH I WAS SO. WITH REGARD TO THE- ONES IN THE I BELIEVE IS YES I WE WOULDN'T WE WOULDN'T. BECAUSE THE REST. FUNDING THE MAJOR SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR WOULD BE COMING THROUGH THE HOUSE. AND ALLOW OF OUR- OUT A LOT OF HOW WE BE A WAR WITH WORKING WITH THE LOCAL PARK TO AWARD FUNDING FOR TO DELIVER FIVE. AND ALSO LET ADDITION FEDERAL I WOULD SAY WE WOULD BE THE LEAD IN THAT AND ALSO BECAUSE WE ARE OUTRAGEOUS INVOLVED DEVELOPING THE STATE FRIEDMAN AT THESTATE FAIR PLAN I WOULD SAY MORE SO THAN THE OTHER AGENCY YES WE WOULD WE WOULD BE IN THE LEAD ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENT OF THIS BUT THANK YOU. MISTER PATTERSON INVOLVED IN THE INLAND PORT PLANNING AND OUR REGION I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KEEP ME INFORMED OF THOSE MEETINGS AND I'D LIKE TO BE A PART OF THOSE. AT INVOLVED. THANK YOU SIR.

WITH ABOUT 98% OF THOSE BENEFITING UNDER CERTAIN THE STORK WEEKS GOOD COMMUNITIES SO OVERALL WITH WE'VE BEEN HITTING THE GROUND RUNNING FOR THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO DELIVER MORE ON THAT THIS BIBLE AFTER. THAT IT'S GOOD TO HEAR- I AM SURE YOU AGREE WITH ME THAT- CLEANING UP THE EXISTING LETTERS ONLY HALF THE BATTLE- WHAT. ARE WE DOING TO- PREVENT. ADDITIONAL FROM PILAR UP AND HOW DO WE CONVINCE BATES PEOPLE FOR GARBAGE OUT THERE WHEN- AS- YOU KNOW IT'S THAT FAR TOO OFTEN. BOB WHAT ARE WE DOING TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT OUR PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS TO RAISE AWARENESS THE DRIVING PUBLIC OR JUST- USES OF OUR OFF OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IT JUST IT PLEASE BE AWARE THAT. ARE NOT LITERATE- AS WELL AS WORKING LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS- IT TO. GET TO MONITOR AND HAS- WE AT LETTER- EMPLOYERS ARE CAUGHT TO BE ABLE TO- BY THOSE LAWS ABOUT. THE BY BUT THAT KIND OF THE GENERAL INTO RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH A PUBLIC A- I'M A LITTLE THE STATE LAW TO JUST AWARE. IN AN ATTACK THIS MADE WHAT'S THE BUZZ FOR THE PUBLIC. CAMPAIGN I. DON'T HAVE THAT READILY AVAILABLE BUT I WILL HAVE I WILL. SPEAK I WILL HAVE. TO GET THAT FOR YOU. ANY SENSE OF. OF HOW THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE- THAT IT- IS WITHIN THE OVERALL BUDGET. I CAN JUMP IN HERE- JAMES OR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- THIS IS A THREE YEAR PROGRAM SO OVER THE THREE YEARS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- IS SPECIFICALLY DEDICATED TO THE PUBLIC EDUCATION PART OF THIS PROGRAM. AND I I'D LIKE TO GET MORE DETAILS ON WHAT THAT PROGRAM ACTUALLY ENTAILS AND TO HOW IT HOW IT'S BEEN DEVELOPED IN. WHAT WHAT THE MESSAGING IS ON. ABSOLUTELY CAN WORK AT THEIR OFFICE. TO GET THAT INFORMATION THANK YOU MS FRIEDMAN IF OU HAVE A QUESTION YEAH I'M WONDERING- WHAT MATCH IF THERE'S ANY METRICS BEING USED TO EVALUATE THE PROGRAM AND- IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHERE THESE ROADS LOOK LIKE YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS LATER AND THE REASON I ASK BECAUSE I AM ALSO WONDERING HOW MUCH OF THE PROGRAM FUNDS ARE GOING TO THINGS LIKE SIGNAGE ON PUBLIC ART AND HOW MUCH IS GOING TO ACTUAL. CLEANUP THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION I TYPICALLY IN THE SPRING AND IT IS ABOUT THIS TIME WHERE THE- OUR MAINTENANCE THE- MAINTENANCE PROGRAM. BEGINS OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE EVALUATIONS WERE ABLE TO GO OUT TO THOSE ROADWAYS WERE WE'RE- CURRENTLY PROVIDING LITTER CLEANUPS- AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THE MAINTENANCE OPERATION SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THAT NOW. ON AND WE CAN REPORT- REPORT THOSE RESULTS IN THE COMING MONTHS. AND THE SPLIT BETWEEN SIGNAGE- PUBLIC ART. BEAUTIFICATION VERSES. OF THE REMOVAL AND- HAZARD REMOVAL. OVERALL I BELIEVE THE TOTAL AMOUNT I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT DOLLARS AND FOR ME I BELIEVE THE BEAUTIFICATION PROGRAM IS ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR BEAUTIFICATION PROJECTS- WITH ROUGHLY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WAS INITIALLY BUDGETED FOR THE LOCAL PROGRAM GRANT AND THE REMAINING DEDICATED TO OUR MAINTENANCE- DIRECTLY- ACTIVITIES WHICH INCLUDES PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS- IN OTHER ASSOCIATE WITH WILL LATENCIES CLEAN UP DAYS. AND SUCH THINGS. THIS REGION IS MORE- FROM FINANCE- SO IT IN THE ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS APPROVED. OR FIVE HUNDRED ABOUT HALF MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN HALF OF THE MONEY IS FOR CAN BE USED FOR THE BEAUTIFICATION PROJECTS THAT I'M LIKE MISTER DUNCAN WAS SAYING. NOT JUST PICKING UP THE TRASH BUT REALLY TRANSFORMING SOME OF THESE AREAS. I'M THE ONE ONE PART OF THE PROPOSAL- INITIALLY LAST YEAR THAT. WAS REJECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE WAS THE SPECIFIC PART GRANTS AND SO THAT IS NOT PART OF THE PROGRAM BUT- LIKE I SAID BEFORE THERE ARE. A LOT ABOUT HALF THE FUNDS USED. FOR BEAUTIFICATION PROJECTS. MY GUESS IS IN THE AND I'D LOVE TO HEAR BACK FROM LMAO. AFTER HEARING THE ARGUMENTS. ALL RIGHT LET'S OF OFFICIAL ARE QUESTIONS FIRST NOVEL GO BACK TO ALEJO- IS RIVAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- YOU KNOW I SUPPORT- OF CONTINUING YOU KNOW THE FUNDING- FOR MORE HIGHWAY BEAUTIFICATION- AND LITTER REMOVAL IN MY DISTRICT OF THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE CALL THAT WE GET IN MY DISTRICT OFFICE FROM CONSTITUENTS ARE COMPLAINTS ABOUT LITTER ON OUR HIGHWAYS- IN THE DISTRICT.

A LOT OF TIMES THOSE ARE THE NUMBER ONE COMPLAINT THAT I'M GETTING AND MY OFFICE- YOU KNOW IS STILL HAVING CHALLENGES- WITH COMMUNICATIONS WITH CALTRANS AND AT THAT ARE IN OUR DISTRICT- WE REPORT THEM WE EXPECT UPDATES SOMETIMES THOSE UPDATES ARE PROVIDED TO ANOTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICE INSTEAD OF MY OFFICE. WHILE WE ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THESE CASES WE WANT TO PARTNER WITH CALTRANS THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND MY CONSTITUENTS AND I EXPECT THAT COMMUNICATION WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO HELP AND PARTNER- TO GET RID OF THIS LITTER ON THE HIGHWAYS SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. UP YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE DOING WHEN.

THE LITTER CLEANUP AND BEAUTIFICATION SO DURING THIS YEAR'S- REPORTING REQUIREMENT THOSE METRICS ARE PRELIMINARY BECAUSE THE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED YET- SINCE THIS- BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE HAVING THAT SECOND YEAR PROGRAMMATIC OUTCOMES WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE THE DATA ON WHAT WAS ACTUALLY CLEANED UP IN THE PROJECTS THAT WERE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED AND COMPLETED WHICH WOULD PUT THE LEGISLATURE IN ABOUT IT BETTER POSITION AND BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE.

THANK YOU ARE AYE AYE WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED- IF THE- STATE'S CLEAN AIR VEHICLE. PROGRAM WERE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ABILITY OF CONSUMERS TO- TO OBTAIN THOSE VEHICLES OR MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CONSUMERS IS THAT. SOMETHING THAT CAN BE. QUANTIFIED CAN THE STATE'S PROGRAM BE- FOR LACK OF A BETTER EXPRESSION- THROTTLED- IN A IN A WAY THAT- GOOD PROVIDE FOR LESS PRESSURE ON THE OVERALL MARKET ECONOMIC PRESSURE.

WELL GIVEN THAT THERE IS A- EXTREME LIMITATION ON SUPPLY IT'S HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE THAT THERE'S NOT AND- A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT- A GIVEN THE BUYING POWER OF THE STATE- SO I'D APPRECIATE. GETTING SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THE BROWN. I CURIOUS ABOUT. IMPLEMENT AT THE HEAVY DUTY- SIDE OF IT YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU MAY BE GOING WITH CLEANER DIESEL- AS YOU MOVE FORWARD- AND I KNOW THAT THE WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE- FORCE ABSENT HEAVY DUTIES IS STILL EVOLVING BUT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES THAT YOU PLAN ON REPLACING ARE YOU PLANNING ON REPLACING WITH SAYS FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M SORRY- YEAH RIGHT NOW THE INITIAL PLAN AS PART OF THE FIRST TWO YEAR EFFORT THE FOCUS FOR THE HEAVY DUTY IS ON THE DIESEL- DIESEL EMISSION OR DIESEL ARE DRIVEN VEHICLES- AND WE'RE LOOKING AT YEARS THREE AND BEYOND AS- BEING THE PRIMARY FOCUS. AS WE WORK WITH THE VENDORS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF D. B. INTO THE HEAVY DUTY- RIGHT NOW IT'S LOOKING AT A COUPLE YEARS OUT BEFORE THAT THAT TECHNOLOGY IS READILY AVAILABLE IN THAT IT WOULD BE IN THE HEAVY DUTY AREA. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SUCH A SUCH LARGE PURCHASES KNOWS HAVE KNOWS AND PURCHASES IN THE HEAVY DUTY AREA THE NEXT TWO YEARS. CUT BACK ON THE MARKET. YES THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL S. SO YOU'RE HAVE ANY HEAVY DO THOSE OF THE HAVE CURRENT. FILE THAT NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF NO. THE MY QUESTION IS IF TRACK IT IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THE DIESEL POWER SWEEPER COST NEARLY SAY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. A NEW ELECTRIC SWEEPERS GO TO COST SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND BUT I'D LIKE SOME UPDATE FOR MAINTENANCE BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A DIESEL. SWEEPER CAN RUN ALL DAY LONG YOU JUST FILL IT BACK UP BUT ELECTRIC SWEEPER OR BOTH THE HEAVY DUTY TRUCK HOW MUCH TIME ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO RUN THAT VEHICLE DURING THE DAY AS WE MOVE FORWARD INTO THIS OF. ELECTRIC FUTURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO PUSH IN CALIFORNIA BUT I WOULD LIKE SOME COMPARISON AND MAINTENANCE AND COST AS WE GO THROUGH THIS BECAUSE STARTED TWICE AS MUCH COST BUT IT MAYBE YOU GET HALF AS MUCH TIME AS THIS YEAR'S. SO WHILE AN EYE ON IT WE MOVE FOR THANKS FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY WILL DEFINITELY BE MONITORING THAT AND WE CAN. INCLUDE THAT IN OUR IN OUR LATER YOUR QUESTIONS YOU CAN SEE IT IN CORPORATE THIS. AGGRESSIVE THE PUBLIC YOU CAN PLAN. FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR IN THE SAME THING IN MY- OR CHARGING STATION I'D LIKE TOA WE'RE GOING TO GO TO A LACK. CHARGING VEHICLES TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE CHARGERS AT THE SITE AND NOT BY THE VEHICLES AND NOT HAVE THE CHARGE OF THE COORDINATED. TO MOVING FORWARD AND YOU MIGHT ALREADY HAVE SOME SITES MAYBE THEY GET THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES VERSUS A SITE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A CHARGER. AND HOPEFULLY THAT'S COORDINATED- WITH THE DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES. TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T BUY A FLEET OF VEHICLES AND DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CHARGING. AND MY COLLEAGUE TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT WE NEED IN THE STATE. TO GO TO OF. ALL ELECTRIC SO WE GOT TO WATCH AT AND SLOWLY GET THERE NOT JUST FLIP THE SWITCH. AND THINK WE'RE ALL GOING TO COLLECT TOMORROW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

AND THE OF COURSE- BICYCLISTS AS WELL ARE ON THE INCREASE AND THAT MAY BE PART OF WHAT'S DRIVING THESE NUMBERS BUT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW WHETHER IT IS- DRIVER BEHAVIOR IN ATTENTION BY ADMIN THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT BE CONTRIBUTING TO THIS- IN INCREASED NUMBERS AND TO- ONCE WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN- A BETTER ADDRESS WHAT THE- THE BETTER JUST PREVENTIVE MEASURES. MS FRIEDMAN. YEAH I GUESS IT'S NOT A QUESTION SO MUCH AS A COMMENT I COMPLETELYAGREE WITH THE CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE YOUR- PUTTING A- EMPHASIS ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM AND THIS IS REALLY A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AT THIS POINT. AND IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT IS- TOUCHING A LOT OF OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES ON YOU KNOW EQUITY ISSUES- BECAUSE YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO CYCLE AROUND DO SO BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD A CAR THIS IS THE PRIMARY MODE OF TRANSPORTATION PEOPLE ARE WALKING. THE SAME REASON THERE'S PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS BECAUSE BESIDES YOU KNOW GETTING HIT BY A CAR IS NOT HEALTHY FOR YOU BUT IF YOU'RE FREE TO GO OUT AND RIDE YOUR BIKE OR WALK- OF COURSE IT'S A LOT LESS HEALTHY I MEAN I. FOR ONE AM AFRAID TO LET MY OWN DAUGHTER RIDE HER BIKE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE SIDEWALKS AND I'M NERVOUS ABOUT HER BEING ON THE STREET. AND THAT'S NOT FAIR TO HER SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RIDE A BIKE IN THE STREET LIKE. SO MANY OF US DID WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP- BESIDES TRYING TO GET TO THE ROOT CAUSE OF WHAT'S BEHIND THESE. THESE TRAGEDIES I WOULD ALSO THROUGH- ADD TO THAT THE- SOME UNDERSTANDING AT SOME POINT I KNOW THIS PROBABLY ISN'T THE RIGHT PLACE BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. THESE INCIDENTS ARE HANDLED BY PROSECUTORS INCLUDE- I'VE HEARD FEEDBACK FROM THE BICYCLE COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY THAT MANY TIMES THINGS THAT REALLY SHOULD BE. PROSECUTED AS- RECKLESS DROPS. OR SOME SORT OF VEHICLE INFRACTION OR NOT THAT IT'S CHALKED UP TO THE BEHAVIOR OF THE CYCLIST OR THE BEHAVIOR OF THE DRIVER BUT THERE'S A REASON WHY THIS HAPPENED JUST AS THE MOST ASTEROID FALLS IN THE SKY AND CAUSES THIS OR A TREE FALLS ON SOMEONE THAT'S AN ACCIDENT. BUT A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT IS NOT ACTUALLY AN ACCIDENT SOMETHING WENT WRONG IF WE DON'T LOOK AT WHAT THAT IS WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE FOR IT. SO I'LL JUST PUT IT THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T WE DON'T SAY WHEN THEIR PLANE CRASHES LIKE HEY JUST AN ACCIDENT THESE THINGS HAPPEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON WE REALLY INVESTIGATE IT A LOT MORE PEOPLE KILLED. IN CAR CRASHES IN BY PLANE CRASHES AND YET WE SORT OF JUST SAID HEY THAT'S JUST COLLATERAL DAMAGE IS THE WAY IT IS SO I THINK WE NEED A LOT MORE FOCUS ON THIS AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S- MAKING A BUDGETARY BUT ALSO POLICY BUT I JUST WANTED TO. I TWENTY THREE MY PIECE ON THIS THIS BIT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT THIS FUNDING IS ALL ABOUT IS- CONDUCTING SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS ON- AT SOME POINT WE SHOULD HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING WHETHER- WE'RE ACTUALLY. INVESTING ENOUGH MONEY IN INVESTIGATIONS LIKE THIS AND WHETHER WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE MISTER BENNETT. JUST JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT IT IS A SPECIFIC QUESTION AND THAT IS WE'RE GOING TO THE INVESTIGATIONS HOW WILL THE INVESTIGATIONS BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION GRANTS THAT ARE OUT THERE TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WHEN IT COMES TO THE RESULTS OF THESE- THESE INVESTIGATIONS THAT WE WANT OTHER ON THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM THAT'S WHAT THE DEPARTMENT ABLE TO INCORPORATE I- CHANGES. AS PART OF THE SHOP IS THAT HOW WE OPERATIONS PROTECTION PROGRAM SO THEY'RE ALREADY THERE WAS A PROJECT THAT WE CAN PROGRAM AN IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENT TO ADDRESS. ANY SAFETY MEASURES TO- TO ENSURE SAFETY FOR THE USERS WERE ALSO ABLE TO SHARE THE RESULTS WITH OUR LOCAL AGENCY PARTNERS WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM- THAT THE MINISTRY OF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. THE BULK OF THOSE- AS A PROJECT THAT ARE AWARDED OR PROGRAMS THAT PROGRAMS ARE APPLIED FOR BY LOCAL AGENCIES SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL AGENCIES WHEN IT COMES TO. PROJECT THAT MAY BE ON THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM CAPTION DISABLED INCORPORATE IDENTIFY SPECIFIC NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. A BOAT BICYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIAN MEETS THE LOCAL AGENCIES WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL OF THAT DATA AND SAY APPLY FOR THEIR GRANTS X. CENTER. SEX WE WORK CLOSELY AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL AGENCY PARTNERS THERE IS SOME PLACE THAT. THEY CAN ACCESS THIS DATA. THERE SIMPLE WE CAN. THEM NOT A- HEALTHY SYSTEM AVAILABLE WHERE THEY CAN THE DATA BUT THEY CAN BE ACQUIRE THE INFORMATION FROM OUR- CONTACT. WITH WANNA FIND A WAY TO MAKE THAT DATA. POST AT DATA SOMEWHERE SO THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO IT SO THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ACCESS SHOULD IF EVERYBODY HAS TO GO TO YOU AND ASK. OKAY WE'RE GETTING READY TO DO A GRANT ON THIS WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS A SAFETY DATA. THAT DOESN'T. DOESN'T STRIKE ME AS AS OF AS EFFICIENT SO I JUST WOULD OFFER THAT AS POTENTIAL SUGGESTIONS THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU I MISS FRIEDMAN YEAH I'M SORRY I THINK I LOST MY THREAD A LITTLE WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT ONE OF THE I THINK WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IS IF IT THAT WE HAVE IF WEHAVE DATA THAT SAYS THAT FOR INSTANCE A VEHICLE VEHICLES THE DRIVERS WERE AT FAULT AND SOME OF THESE INCIDENTS I THINK IT WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL TO FIND OUT HOW MANY OF THOSE RESULTED IN SOME SORT OF- AS SOME SORT OF EITHER CRIMINAL CHARGE OR OR INFRACTION CHARGE FOR THE DRIVER BECAUSE THIS IS A COMMON COMPLAINT THAT I'VE GOTTEN FROM THE BICYCLE COMMUNITY THAT. THE DRIVER WAS AT FAULT HIT A CYCLIST AND NOTHING'S DONE- BECAUSE IT'S JUST CONSIDERED LIKE HEY YOU KNOW IT'S AN ACCIDENT OR OR EVEN SOMETIMES LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT UNDERSTANDING WHO IS REALLY AT FAULT AND THAT YOU KNOW KNOW THAT THERE WAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT HIT THE PRO ATHLETE YOU KNOW BE MORE FOR THE DRIVER AND SO THERE'S THE FEEL THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES THAT ARE MEANT TO KEEP THEM SAFE AND SO BE GOOD IN THE DATA TO ALSO SAY. IF THERE WERE VEHICLE WAS FOUND TO BE AT FAULT WITH A COLLISION HOW OFTEN DID THOSE RESULT IN SOME SORT OF ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST THAT DRIVER SO THAT'S ALL I'M SUGGESTING. THANK YOU SIMILAR WE HAPPEN TO GO BACK TO THE PROGRAM AND SEE IF THEY HAVE THAT INFORMATION AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION BUT THEY- HAVE TAKEN PLACE. AND TO SEE IF THE THERE ARE RESULTS WE CAN IDENTIFY WHERE WERE- DRIVERS. MAY HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED OR IN THAT REGARDS.

SB SIX SEVENTY ONE WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR AND CALLS FOR- AND I DON'T RECALL THE SPECIFICS OF IT FRANKLY BT CALLS FOR AS ALL BILLS DO- CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF- OF ACTIVITIES AND ACTIONS BUT IT. SOUNDS LIKE- THE COMMISSION IS ONLY IMPLEMENTED SOME OF THOSE INSTEAD OF ALL OF THOSE. WHY WITH THE COMMISSION ONLY BE PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING THAT HAS PASSED THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND- DULY SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR. OR MAYBE I'M WRONG ASSUMPTION. YEAH WILL WILL I THINK WHAT THE FUNDING PROPOSED WILL STILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE COR ASPECTS OF THE ASSESSMENT I THINK IT'S MORE SOME OF THE- ADDITIONAL RESEARCH THAT WE HAD ORIGINALLY HOPED TO DELIVER ALL SIX MORE LIMITATIONS WITH THE FUNDING PROPOSED.

WAS DETERMINED BASED ON ALL THIS. WELL LIKE I REALIZE THIS IS THE FUNDING LEVEL- BUT YOU'RE NOT BEING RESPONSIVE TO MY QUESTION WHICH IS WHY YOU NOT FUNDING- EVERYTHING THAT'S CALLED FOR IN THIS LEGISLATION. I WOULD SAY THAT THE THIS LEVEL WHAT'S PROPOSED BASED ON THE FACT THAT THERE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. AGAIN I'M GONNA THROW BACK TO OUR OF A HIGHLY QUALIFIED STAFF FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS HEADING INTO- THE MAY REVISE AND WE DO PASSED LEGISLATION AND IT SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR- THAT- DUE RESPECT BE GIVEN TO THE ENTIRE TO THE ALLEGES OF THE LEGISLATION.

THAT'S GREAT THANK THANK YOU- FOR THAT AND- LOOK DON'T FORGET YOUR CAMPAIGN GOT STARTED RIGHT HERE. IN THE STATE NUMBER THREE. YOU WANT TO- ARE- NEXT ITEM WHICH IS- ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE- A FAR MORE- I WELL A VERY IMPORTANT- ISSUE A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS- THEN- AT THE END AND THEN MANDATE- AN ISSUE THAT'S COME UP TO THE FOUR REALLY IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS COMBATING. ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT AND I KNOW- THAT- THE CHP HAS BEEN- REALLY- WORKING HARD ON THAT. YES SIR AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF OUR EFFORTS BUT I AND I HOPEFULLY AND I KNOW OF TALKING A LITTLE BIT IN A MINUTE BUT THAT YOU SEE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS. AND HAVING THE PERSONNEL TO BE ABLE TO THE TAKE ON THIS NEW- ASPECT IN AND WITH ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME TEST WITH OUR REBEKAH TASK FORCE. AND FOR THAT REASON AND- TO SEE IF YOU WERE REQUESTING- SIX MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND THROUGH THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY FIVE. YOU'RE REQUESTING TEN POINT FIVE MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX AND THEN FIFTEEN MILLION FOR PERMANENT AUGMENTATION BEGINNING IN YEARS TWENTY TWENTY SIX AND TWENTY SEVEN. TO MAKE OUR ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME TASK FORCE OPERATIONS PERMANENT AND THIS FUNDING HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO SEIZE HE TO FULFILL OUR LEGISLATIVELY. REQUIREMENTS UNDER ASSEMBLY BILL THREE THIRTY ONE WHICH WAS AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOICE ALL YEAR. AND MAKE PERMANENT THE CHP'S EFFORTS TO COMBAT ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME STATE WHITE. DEPARTMENT WE PREVIOUSLY AND TWENTY IF YOU'RE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY RECEIVE. A FIVE POINT SEVENTY SIX BILLION TO ESTABLISH OUR RETAIL CRIMES TASK FORCE TEAMS IN THREE. INDIVIDUALS WHICH INCLUDED GOLDEN GATE WHICH IS THE BAY AREA BORDER I'M WHICH IS DOWN SOUTH IN THIS- SAN DIEGO AREA. AND SOUTHERN DIVISION WHICH INCLUDES THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA. AT LEAST THE THREE TASK FORCE TEAMS THAT. HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND COLLABORATING WITH RETAILERS ALLIED AGENCY LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S TO IDENTIFY AND PROSECUTE ORGANIZED GATHERINGS. RECOVER FILES MARGIN RESTRAINING OF THE HARD WORK OF THE OFFICERS ASSIGNED TO THESE TEAMS THAT THEY'VE DONE IT AND THE SUCCESS THAT THEY'VE HAD IN COMBATING THIS GROWING PROBLEM. ASSIST OUR TASK FORCE WAS LEGISLATIVELY AUTHORIZED TWENTY NINETEEN WE PARTICIPATED IN AND AS THOUSAND RETAIL CRIME CASES. A MONSTER WE DO REACHED THIS WEEK ARE WE COVERED OVER TO ONE TUNE ESTO EMERGENT. AND HAVE MADE NEARLY FOUR IF ARRESTS. IT'S A BIG FOR YOU FIVE AS A COME IN THE HOUSE. AND TO TALK TO YOU. ALTHOUGH I FEEL LIKE STATISTICS ARE. I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A NEED TO EXPAND OUR RETAIL THEFT INVESTIGATIONS IN EDUCATION. TO OTHER AREAS EXPERIENCING ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME TO INCLUDE A GREATER SACRAMENTO AREA AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND SO THE PROPOSAL IS SEEKING SIX MILLION THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOR PROACTIVE ENFORCEMENT. BY EXISTING CHP DETECTIVES INVESTIGATORS AND ROPA CHAU OFFICERS. IN OUR VALUES CENTER DIVISIONS AND THE TEN POINT FIVE MILLION WILL BE TO AUGMENT EXISTING TASK FORCE BINDING. AND THEN THE FIFTEEN MILLION THERE WILL BE BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN WOULD BE TO PROVIDE PERMANENT FUNDING. FOR THE FIVE CT DIVISION IS EXPERIENCING THE HIGHEST ORGANIZED ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME. AND ADDITIONALLY- THIS PROPOSAL WILL ALLOW TO SEIZE P. TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY BASED PLATFORMS FOR INVESTIGATIVE USE. AND THESE TOOLS BY DESIGNER GOING TO ASSIST THE DEPARTMENT- WITH CORN AT PROBLEMS THROUGH DATA COLLECTION AND EDUCATION THE EVALUATION. LOOKING AT ANALYTICS AND THE DISSEMINATION TO CHP INVESTIGATORS. AND ALLIED AGENCIES ALIKE- FOR EXAMPLE ARE ALL RIGHT BYE- SCANNERS. I WILL ALLOW EASIER DIDN'T. OF STOLEN OR- AND ALLOW FOR US TO RETURN THE PROPERTY TO THE RETAILER VICTIMS. OTHER EQUIPMENT SUCH AS SPECIALIZED COMPUTERS AND LARGE CAPACITY HARD DRIVES ARE GOING TO. ARE GOING TO HELP US TO BE ABLE TO PROCESS AND STORED LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA VIDEO AUDIO AND OTHER DIGITAL MEDIA EVIDENCE. THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THESE TYPES OF COMPLEX INVESTIGATIONS SO THE TRACKING DATA AND TRENDS ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL THEFT. CAN ALSO ASSISTED DETECTION AND INVESTIGATION AFFILIATED CRIMES- SO. MANY EXAMPLES IN THE INCLUDE VEHICLE BURGLARY AND THERE'S A LOT OF SOLICITING CRIME TO COME A RETAIL THEFT BURGLARY IDENTITY THEFT CREDIT CARD. FRAUD FORGERY SEE THAT IS THE ONLY PROP AND ASSOCIATE CYBER. TO USE TAKEN. AND HOW TO LIVE WILL ALLOW THE SIEGE. AT THE STATE OFFICE MAY. TO IDEAL. REAL TIME. RATES TRY. AND THEN USE THESE TRENDS AND PATTERNS TO DRIVE FUTURE DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES. SO LIMITED IF YOU CAN LIVE A LONG BEFORE I CLOSE THIS ONE TAKE ONE MOMENT TO HIGHLIGHT THE PREVENTATIVE WORK. THAT WE'VE DONE IN EDUCATION- BECAUSE NOT JUST ENFORCEMENT EDUCATION IS IMPORTANT AND WE PARTNER WITH VARIOUS RETAILERS AT A RETAIL ASSOCIATION TO PROVIDE SAFETY AND SECURITY TRAINING- SO THAT THE RETAILERS BOTH SMALL AND LARGE THEY KNOW HOW TO BETTER PROTECT THEMSELVES. AGAINST ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT AND CLOSING IN A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME HAS A STATED AT THE BEGINNING- WE SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY COMBAT ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT CRIME IN CALIFORNIA. USING BOTH EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT AND FOR THAT REASON RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING SUPPORT. THIS PROPOSAL TO ALLOW THE EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM INTO OTHER AREAS CURRENTLY UNDERSERVED AND. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU L. A. O. ECONOMY. AT THANK CHAIR UNITS ROAD LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AT SO THIS PROPOSAL IS ONE OF NINE THAT MAKES UP THE GOVERNOR'S UP PROPOSED PUBLIC SAFETY PACKAGE- OVERALL WE FOUND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE LACKS CLEAR OBJECTIVES FOR ACHIEVING THE INTENDED PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE- MAY DETERMINE THAT THERE ARE OTHER. PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS THAT ARE OF HIGHER PRIORITY- ADDITIONALLY WE FOUND THAT CERTAIN PROPOSALS INCLUDING THIS ONE MAY NOT BE STRUCTURED TO. ACHIEVE ITS DESIRED OUTCOMES- IN REDUCING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT CRIME. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THE ADMINISTRATION IS REQUESTING TO STAFF THE EXPANSION OF THE TASK FORCE WITH OVERTIME AS C. H. B. CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEDICATE FULL TIME OFFICERS TO THE NEW PROPOSED TASK FORCES DUE TO A HIGH VACANCY RATE. S. WITH OVERTIME COULD FACE CHALLENGES AND CAN IMPACT THE- OUTCOMES ACHIEVED- IN ADDITION WE NOTE THAT DOJ WITH ITS EXISTING EXPERTISE WITH DEDICATED TASK FORCES AS WELL AS MANAGING TASK FORCES WITH. VARIOUS PARTNERS COULD BE A BETTER ENTITY TO ADMINISTER ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT TASK FORCES PARTICULARLY IF THE STATE IS INTERESTED IN THOSE COORDINATED BY CRIMINAL GANGS AND THAT WORKS- DOJ ALSO EMPLOYS BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIVE PERSONNEL AND ATTORNEYS WHICH CAN MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO WORK TOGETHER. TO SUCCESSFULLY INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE CASES. THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK U. S. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- DO YOU HAVE- A REPORT AND OR A RESPONSE TO THE L. A. O.'S COMMENTS. CATHY MCLEOD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I'M. C. H. P. WAS PASSED WITH ORGANIZED RETAIL TASK FORCE MADE DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB. AND I'M SORRY AND THEY DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB AND. I DON'T SEE IT NECESSARY TO MOVE IT AWAY FROM THEM. ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU I'M A COMMISSIONER I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU ABOUT THE I MEAN YOU YOU DID DESCRIBE THE- THE- ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT- AS HAVING A VERY VERY BROAD- A FORTY OVER A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT- CRIMES AND HOW IT EXPANDS OUTWARD INTO VARIOUS AREAS- DOES IT ALSO INCLUDE- DIFFERENT AREAS WHERE ORGANIZED THEFT BUT PERHAPS NOT RETAIL THEFT- IS INVOLVED IN WHAT COMES TO MIND- FOR ME IS- ORGANIZED AUTOMOBILE THEFT AND THE- CATALYTIC CONVERTER. THIS IS SOMETHING I AM KEENLY AWARE OF BECAUSE I'VE HAD TWO OF THEM STOLEN- CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT. YOU MISTER I THINK WOULD AGREE IT WITH REGARD TO CASH OUT OF BATH AND CAL THE CONVERTER YOU KNOW WE ARE THE LEADING AGENCY WITH- IDLE FAST AND CALIFORNIA WITH A BONAFIDE. MEMBER CORRECTLY I THINK WE HAVE ABOUT A NINETY FOUR PERCENT- YOU KNOW- RETENTION RATE WHERE WE WERE WE ABLE TO RECOVER THOSE VEHICLES THAT INVEST OLD AND- IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT IS SOMETHING WHERE- WE DO HAVE A OUTSTANDING PROGRAM FOR THAT. THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS YES OR BIG CONCERN AND- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IS THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A PART OF OUR HER NORMAL DUTIES I WOULD TELL YOU WITHOUT F. AND BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO. THE CALIFORNIA N. AS WELL AS IN AS A PUBLIC SERVICE AGENCY BUT AS A POST IT WITH WITH THIS WITH I WAS A RETAIL. AND THEN I DON'T HAVE I WILL SEE THEIR THERE TO THEIR LANES YOU KNOW BUT YES BECAUSE THEY COULD LINES MASS SO THEY DO THE- IN THE CASE WE JUST DID RECENTLY YES I WOULD SAY THE CARS THE VEHICLES THAT THEY WERE IN WERE STOLEN SO. THEY OFTEN DO IN. SOMETHING THOSE ARE STATISTICS THAT WE. WE KEEP AS WELL. WELL OKAY I JUST WANT- PERHAPS THE DEFINITION THAT WE USE FOR ORGAN- AFTER. IS CAN. BY ADDING THE WORD RETAIL WHEREAS- YOU KNOW THERE ARE. THERE ARE PROBABLY MANY OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE ARE- UNHAPPY HAD A QUALITIES OF ORGANIZED AFTER. AND WE WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO ALL OF THEM. YES SIR WE DO I JUST THINK WITH RETAIL THEFT I THINK THAT'S JUST BASICALLY USE MATCH ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER ORGANIZED CRIME RINGS I THINK THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON. PARTICULARLY JUST THOSE ARE WORKING WITH OUR ALLIED PARTNERS IN AND US TO LIKE WITH SOME OF THE TASK FORCE WITH DOJ WE PARTICIPATE ON THOSE TASK FORCES WELL AND MAKE SURE THOSE RESOURCES ARE ARE CENTERED ON THOSE CRIMES BUT YES LIKE I SAID THEY HAVE TENTACLES. AND THEY DO REACH OUT AND TOUCH OTHER AREAS THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO PULL YOUR FOCUS AWAY FROM- THE RETAIL ASPECT OF THIS MY DISTRICT- HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD HIT. BY A BY ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT AND SITE A COMMAND HERE- AGUIRRE. OF FOCUS ON THE ON ON ON THAT ISSUE. MISTER BENNETT AND THE QUESTIONS RIGHT GETTING. OF CAN GO ON TO ISSUE FOR. ANOTHER SERIOUS TOPIC THE- VIOLENCE. SPORES YES IT IS A THIS- VERY PROUD OF THIS FOR AND THE CAL HIGHWAY. IS REQUESTING A ONE TIME FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND OF FOUR MILLION AT THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THREE MILLION THREE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND THREE MILLION THREE HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND AND FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. TO ADDRESS THE INCREASE IN VIOLENT CRIMES OCCURRING ON STATE HIGHWAYS. AT THESE VIOLENT CRIMES THE INCLUDE FREEWAY SHOOTINGS HOMICIDES ASSAULTS RAPES. BATTERIES AND- AND ALLOW CRIMES INVOLVING OBJECTS THROWN OR CITED VEHICLES AND DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN VIOLENT CRIMES COMMITTED ON STATE HIGHWAYS IN RECENT YEARS AS HE'S BE CREATED A HIGHWAY VIOLENCE TASK FORCE. ALTHOUGH STILL IN ITS INFANCY STAGES THE FUNDING IDENTIFIED IN THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE INVESTIGATIVE AND ENFORCEMENT EQUIPMENT INVESTIGATIVE TECHNOLOGY NEEDS AND OPERATIONAL EXPENSES NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE TASK FORCE- THE PROPOSAL ALSO WILL FACILITATE. CONCENTRATED ENFORCEMENT DETAILS TO VERY IMPORTANT AND UTILIZED INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS TO BOTH APPREHEND VIOLATORS AND CURB FUTURE INCIDENTS. I WANT OF SPECIFIC CONCERN FOR US IS- PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE OUR FREEWAY SHOOTINGS YOU KNOW THIS PROPOSAL WILL ASSIST THE CHP REDUCING INCREASE VIOLENCE SOME CALIFORNIA HIGHWAYS. BY ADDRESSING EMERGENCY EMERGING MEET. FOR INCREASED LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE AS WELL AS INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS TO ASSIST IN APPREHENSION AND. PROSECUTION IN YOU PUT ALL CONCEPT ENFORCEMENT IDENTIFY OKAY. OF CRIME INTENSELY. IS UNKNOWN EFFECTIVE CA. AND PROACTIVELY CRIMINAL ACT IT WORKS YOU KNOW THERE'S NOTHING LIKE SEEING A BLACK AND WHITE. ON THE ROAD AND THAT WILL HELP DETER CRIME. THIS PROPOSAL IS SIX TWO MILLION ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND AN OVERTIME FUNDING FOR THE CONCENTRATED ENFORCEMENT DETAILS THROUGHOUT THE CHP FIELD DIVISIONS MOST AFFECTED BY HIGHWAY VIOLENCE. IN ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE CRIME ANALYTICS AND A DEDICATED ANALYTICAL PERSONNEL TO. COLLATE AGGREGATE AND ANALYZE TO CRIME DATA AND THESE RESOURCES THEY TELL YOU THEY'RE GOING TO ALLOW US TO CLOSE THE CURRENT GAP IN STATE RIGHT ANALYTICAL TOOLS. AND ALLOW TO SEIZE P. INVESTIGATORS TO IDENTIFY REAL TIME CRIME RATES TRANSCEND PATTERNS. AND TO ADDRESS THIS NEED THE PROPOSAL REQUESTING FIVE HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO FIND SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR SEVEN ANALYST POSITIONS TO ANALYZE THESE CRIME DATA AND CONDUCT CRIMINAL ANALYTIC AND RESEARCH- THIS PROPOSAL WE ALSO REQUEST THE NINE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND TO PROVIDE FREE TRAINING I T. AND EQUIPMENT COSTS. ULTIMATELY EACH ASPECT OF THIS PROPOSAL WAS SUPPORTED C. H. P.'S WORK TOWARDS REDUCTION OF VIOLENT CRIMES ON CALIFORNIA HIGHWAYS THANK YOU. THANK YOU LOL THANK YOU CHAIR AT EUNICE ROW AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AT. SO WE HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS WITH REGARDS TO THIS PROPOSAL M. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS HIGHWAY VIOLENCE A PRIORITY I WANT TO DEDICATE THIS THEME OVERALL AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES WE RECOMMEND MODIFYING THE PER- PROPOSAL IN WAYS TO ENSURE THE FUNDED ACTIVITIES WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE IN MEETING THEIR OBJECTIVES. FIRST WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER OTHER ACTIVITIES TO REDUCE HIGHWAY VIOLENCE AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY C. H. P. IS CURRENTLY FACING A HIGH VACANCY RATE AND AS A RESULT SIMILAR TO THE RETAIL THEFT TASK FORCE AT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO STAFF THIS HAS FIRST WITH OVERTIME AS WELL SINCE HE'S P. DOES NOT HAVE THE- THAT A FULL TIME. OFFICERS TO THE PROPOSED TASK FORCE STAFFING- THAT WITH OVERTIME AND WITHOUT DEDICATED POSITIONS CAN BE CHALLENGING AND POTENTIALLY IMPACT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TASK FORCE UNTIL SEIZE P. ADDRESSES THEIR VACANCY ISSUES THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER OTHER ALTERNATIVES THAT COULD. HELP REDUCE CRIME SUCH AS THE INSTALLATION OF CAMERAS ARE LIGHTING SECOND WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE PROPOSED FUNDING FOR THE SEVEN ASSOCIATE- GOVERNOR IN A PROGRAM ANALYST POSITIONS AS WELL AS THE TRAINING I. T. AND EQUIPMENT COSTS TO SUPPORT CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS WE FIND THAT THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES COULD HELP PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE ASSOCIATED FACTORS OF HIGHWAY SHOOTINGS. AND HELP INFORM FUTURE LEGISLATIVE POLICY AND FUNDING DECISIONS REGARDING THE TASK FORCE. AT THIRD WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CHANGED THE FUNDS SOURCE FOR OF THIS PROPOSAL FROM GENERAL FUND TO THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT GIVEN THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS INTENDED TO DIRECTLY BENEFIT YOU THERE'S OF THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM IT WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO USE MBA FOR THESE ACTIVITIES. AND FINALLY WE RECOMMEND REQUIRING THAT SEES P. TO REPORT ON THE NUMBER AND LOCATIONS OF HIGHWAY SHOOTINGS DISSOCIATED FACTORS IN THE SHOOTINGS AS WELL AS THE OUTCOMES. OF THE INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES- THE REPORT COULD ALLOW THE LED TO DID. WHETHER FUTURE RESOURCES- ARE NEEDED TO CONTINUE THE TASK FORCE AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE PROPOSED LIMIT TERM FUNDING. AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE COMMENTS. THANK YOU CHAIR CATHY MCLEOD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M ON THE GENERAL FUND VERSES THE NBA WE JUST LIKE TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WELL THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION PRIORITY AND- AT THIS TIME OF THE GENERAL FUND SURPLUS. AND GIVEN IT'S A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM PROPOSAL WE FELT THAT WAS A GOOD FIT FOR GENERAL FUND. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. IT IT SOUNDS LIKE A THIS IS- AN ISSUE THAT IS- GONNA NEED TO BE ADDRESSED LONG TERM- AND DATA SO WHY OF. THE FILL THESE POSITIONS WITH OVERTIME VERSUS PERMANENT POSITIONS. WELL SIR THAT IS THE PLAN MOVING FORWARD IS THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO- PUT PERMANENT MEMBERS ON A TASK FORCE AS WE FILL OUR CURRENT VACANCIES BUT RIGHT NOW I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE ME THIS PROBLEM EXISTS TODAY SO I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM I AM PUSHING RESOURCES TOWARDS THE ISSUES THAT ARE OCCURRING WHERE THEY'RE CARRYING YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE TRACKING THE LOCATIONS IN USING. ALL THESE MLAS CURRENTLY THIS IS GOING TO MAKE US IS A LOT MORE EFFICIENT IN DOING THAT BUT RIGHT NOW WE ARE DOING IT AND USING WHAT WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE IS THIS YOU KNOW THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ONGOING AND WE WILL ASK YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SORRY NUMBERS GO UP- HER VACANCY RATE GOES DOWN AND WE WOULD DEFINITELY BE PUTTING IN PERMANENT. BODIES IN THESE POSITIONS- THANK YOU FOR THAT. QUESTION THE RELIGION JUST YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CHALLENGES THEY THEY HAVE LOTS OF VACANCIES I THINK L. A. O. WAS VERY VERY APPROPRIATE TO POINT OUT BEING STRETCHED I'D REALLY APPRECIATE FROM THE HIGHWAY PATROL STANDPOINT- SOMEBODY'S GETTING WE WERE HAVING A OF A VIOLENT CRIME PROBLEM. PUBLIC CERTAINLY DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR AND IT'S NOT THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST TO SAY WELL WE'RE JUST NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT- IT. REALLY EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING THESE THOUSAND POSITIONS- IT'S RECRUITED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TRAINED UP AND IMPLEMENT THAT- AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IF THERE'S NO GOOD SOLUTION BECAUSE- CERTAINLY IF WERE BURNING OVER TIME WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INVESTIGATIONS AND EVERYTHING ELSE DOES SUFFER. AS WELL AS A LONG TERM MORALE IF YOU'RE BRINGING OVER TIME ON ON THE- ON THE HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS. FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME THANK YOU. OKAY SIR THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT AND ALSO JUST KNOWING THAT WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE TO OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ELIADES- TALKED ABOUT- INCLUDING CAMERAS AND OTHER THINGS THAT WILL BE ABLE TO USE TO. TO AUGMENT. OUR OUR OFFICER POSITIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE AS WELL. YOU KNOW USING TECHNOLOGY WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE DOT AND EVERYONE ELSE. DEFINITELY A JOINT EFFORT THAT TAKES US TO ISSUE FOURTEEN- WHICH IS- STAFFING FOR- GRANT PROGRAMS SET OUT OF THE CAMPUS TAX BUT- YES SIR- THE CHP WERE REQUESTING AUTHORITY TO HIRE NINE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS TO PROVIDE HE NECESSARY OVERSIGHT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CANNABIS TAX GRANT FROM PROGRAM. AS REQUIRED BY THE PASSAGE OF BOTH THE CONTROL REGULATE REGULATORY AND TAX ADULT USE OF MARIJUANA ACT IN THE MEDICINAL AND ADULT USE OF CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT THERE WAS A LOT SORRY. AND AS SPECIFIED IN THE REVENUE AND TAXATION COOLED THE PORTION OF THE CANNABIS TAXES ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THE C. H. P. FOR THE PURPOSES OF COORDINATING RESEARCH EFFORTS RELATED TO IMPAIRED DRIVING. CONDUCTING TRAINING FOR C. H. P. AND OTHER CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ASSISTING YOU IN EXISTING IMPAIRED DRIVING ENFORCEMENT TECHNOLOGIES AND ADMINISTERING IMPAIRED DRIVING GRANTS AND TO DATE THE CHP HAS UNDERTAKEN SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT CANNABIS RELATED PROJECTS AND HAS GREATLY EXPANDED EXISTING CANNABIS RELATED PROGRAMS. DISEASE PEOPLE RECEIVE AN APPROPRIATION OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THIS WILL CREATE ADDITIONAL GRANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE. VERTICAL PROSECUTION PROGRAMS AND CONTINUE TOXICOLOGY LABORATORY DEVELOPMENT- WITH THE ANTICIPATED WORKLOAD INCREASE THE ORIGINAL PERSONNEL RESOURCES PROVIDED WILL BE INSUFFICIENT AS THE PROGRAM CONTINUES TO EXPAND WITH INCREASE FUNDING AND GRANT OPPORTUNITIES AS SUCH. THE DEPARTMENT REQUEST THE AUTHORITY TO HIRE NINE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO EFFECTIVELY ADMINISTER AND MANAGE MANDATE IT CANNABIS PROGRAMS. THE FUNDING FOR THE NINE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WILL COME FROM THE CANNABIS TAX FINE. IF APPROVED. IS PICKING CONTINUE TO DEVELOP NEW IMPAIRED DRIVING RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY VALUATION PROJECTS INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO CANNABIS THE EMPLOYMENT AT AND IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES THE BETTER HE'S UNIFIED IMPAIRED DRIVERS ESPECIALLY THOSE IMPAIRED BY CANNABIS. AND REMOVE THEM FROM OUR ROADWAYS. THANK YOU THANK YOU L. L. I UNITS RODE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. BERMAN OF FIVE FINANCE- DO YOU HAVE A REPORT AND MAKE A NOTE THAT THERE- THE STAFF COMMENTS- POSE A QUESTION ABOUT TO- THE DECISION MAKING FOR ALLOCATIONS- ONE TWO AND THREE FROM. A FOR THE FOR THE TAX FUND AND HOW LEGISLATURE CAN HAVE INFLUENCE ON THOSE ALLOCATIONS IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THAT HAVE A GREAT. CATHY MCLEOD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YEAH AS NOTED IN PROP SIXTY FOUR STARTING JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. THE BUDGETING FOR ALLOCATION ONE GOES TO A MORE STANDARD MODEL WHERE. WE PROPOSE IN THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATES AND UNTIL THAT TIME IT WE WORK WITH DEPARTMENTS AND THOSE AFFECTED AND BUDGET BASED ON THE SETS NEED AND THEN KEEP THE LEGISLATURE INFORMED. THAT'S ALLOCATION ONE- THAT'S THAT IS ALLOCATION ONE. OF MY ALLOCATION THREE WHICH IS WHAT THE CHP USES THEIR FUNDS ARE USED FOR RESEARCH AND ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS AND THE AFFECTS ON ITS CRIMINALIZATION- THEY ARE CALLED OUT. IN STATUTES THAT 60% TO EDUCATION PREVENTION AND TREATMENT 20% THE CLEAN UP REMEDIATION AND ENFORCEMENT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IN THE 20% TO PUBLIC SAFETY RELATED ACTIVITIES AFTER JANUARY THE WHIMS JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT THEN THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO. MODIFY STATUTE IF THEY SO CHOOSE. AND THAT LEAVES- ALLOCATION NUMBER TWO I THINK. I AM I AM I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY ALLOCATION TO POT SO I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THAT IS ALLOCATED OUT. YEAH THAT BE GREAT IF YOU COULD DO THAT WOULD APPRECIATE WILL DO THAT. AND SIR IF I MAY UM INCLUDING THE BODIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE GOING TO BE- BODIES THAT ARE GONNA BE TO OUR PROFESSIONAL STAFF SO THIS DOESN'T IMPACT SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS AS MUCH AS- YOU KNOW THE- IT WOULD. AS BEING DISCUSSED AS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU REALIZE THAT THEIR BODIES THEY WERE ADDING OR MORE TO DEAL WITH THE- WITH THE PROGRAMMATIC SIDE OF. OF DISTRIBUTING THE FUNDS IN THE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE COMING IN. UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. LESSONS NOPE ALL RIGHT THAT TAKES US WE'RE GETTING DOWN TO THE HOME STRETCH HERE- FIFTEEN. HE IS TO FIFTEEN- THIS IS CENTRALIZED HISTORIAN OF RECORDS AND THE CHP IS REQUESTING A TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM FUNDING OF SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX THOUSAND- FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR FOR SIX POSITIONS TO ESTABLISH A CENTRALIZED CUSTODIAN OF RECORDS UNIT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT'S COMMUNICATIONS CENTER THE SUPPORT SECTION I WITH THE PASSING OF THE NEW LAWS RELATIVE TO PUBLIC RECORDS ACTS. ESTATE WHY PERRY REQUEST CONTINUE TO INCREASE- ESTABLISHING CUSTODIAN OF RECORDS UNIT WILL INCREASE THE SPEED EFFICIENCY ACCURACY AND TRANSPARENCY OF THIS HUGE PIECE RESPONSES TO PR RACE. AS A QUICK BACKGROUND THE CHP OPERATES TWENTY FIVE COMMUNICATIONS CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE UNIT PROPOSED IN THIS B. C. P. WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR P. R. A REQUEST SUBMITTED TO THE FOUR LARGEST COMMUNICATIONS CENTERS WHICH ARE BORDER COMMUNICATIONS WHICH IS A SAN DIEGO AS A STATE GOLDEN GATE COMMUNICATIONS WHICH IS IN THE BAY AREA. LOS ANGELES COMMUNICATIONS AND ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNICATIONS CENTERS I THE UNIT WILL ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESPONDING TO VARIOUS REQUESTS AS WELL AS REQUESTS FOR COMMUNICATIONS LOGS AUDIO AND AUDIO RECORDINGS WHICH WE GET MANY MANY OF. AND AS A MEASURE OF THE UNITS OUTCOMES AND ACCOUNTABILITY PRIOR TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE TWO YEAR PERIOD OF THIS PROPOSAL WILL EVALUATE THE PROGRAM'S EFFECTIVENESS AT. THESE INDETERMINATE NO COMMUNICATION CENTERS CAN BE ADDED TO THE. FOUR I JUST IDENTIFIED. I THE AMOUNT. WILLING A REVIEW OF STATE WORKING. THE TOTAL REQUEST TIMELY RELEASE OF POLICE RECORDS IS VITAL IN MAINTAINING TRUST AND LEGITIMACY WITH BOTH THE PUBLIC AND THE LEGISLATURE AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. ULTIMATELY IT IS OUR INTENT% AFTER SHOWING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF THE UNIT TO RETURN EVERY QUEST TO MAKE THE CUSTODIAN OF RECORDS UNITS ARE PROMINENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU L. A- COMMENTS I UNITS WROTE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU CHAIR CATHY MCLEOD'S DEPARTMENT FINANCE WE HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO ADD THANK YOU. THANK YOU I GUESS- MY QUESTION ON THIS HAS TO DO WITH- THE- IT WOULD STRIKE ME THAT- THE SMALLER- UNITS AROUND THE STATE WOULD- BENEFIT FROM HAVING A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM SINCE IT PROBABLY TAKES A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR TIME TO REQUEST TO RESPOND OR A PR REYES SO WHY NOT INCLUDE SOME OR ALL OF THEM. FROM THE GET GO. I THINK THERE IS ISSUE WITH WHEN WE LOOKED AT OUR STRUCTURE THE WAY IT WAS STRUCTURED IN MOST THINGS ARE HERE AT THE HEADQUARTERS IN SACRAMENTO WE WANTED TO TEST WE ALWAYS KIND OF ROLLED IT OUT AND BY TESTING SOME OF OUR LARGER. I'M CENTERS AND THEN IT'S EASIER FOR US TO PUSH IT OUT IN THE END AND DEAL WITH THOSE ISSUES THAT MAY BE IN OUR LARGER CENTERS AND THEN WE I MEAN THIS IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE WE INCLUDE THEM BUT IT JUST AT THE BEGINNING YOU KNOW JUST BEING ABLE TO HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE FOUR. AND THEN PUSHING IT OUT BECAUSE WE KNOW THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE USING RIGHT NOW IS OVERLOADED BUT- WE IS WE KNOW IT. SO WE JUST WANTED TO TRY THIS FIRST BY BRINGING THE PERSONNEL AND- BECAUSE WE HAD TO GET THEM TRAINED WE HAVE TO GET ALL THESE THINGS. AND SO WE ROLLED IT OUT. IN THOSE PHASES TO ENSURE. THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE STILL BEING RESPONSIVE. TO THESE REQUESTS. WHEN YOU USE THE TERM- IT WON'T BE A HONK. JUST AND I AM NOT GONNA HOLD YOU TO A PARTICULAR DATE BUT- WHAT KIND OF A TIME FRAME DO YOU HAVE IN MIND. WHEN YOU. YEAH I GOTCHA. THANK. YOU ARE THAT WOULD. I DO I DID AND I WAS LUCKY. A DAY YOU AND I DIDN'T I EVEN IMAGINE THAT THE REQUESTED WE GET FOR P. REYES RIGHT NOW HAVE GOT TO THE THAT IT IS NOW BUT IT IS. IT IS IN. PROBABLY A HUNDRED FOLD WHAT USED TO GO ESTHER PRESS WE GET NOW SO BY BEING ABLE TO SEGREGATE THEM AND HAVE THE ONES THAT ARE FOR- FOR OUR COMMUNICATION CENTERS. I REALLY DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE AS LONG AS IT WOULD BE FOR RECORDS FOR RIO FOR SHOOTINGS OR ANY OF THOSE KIND OF THINGS OR ANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MORE FOR SMITH RELATED SO THESE RECORDS ARE EASIER A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO- OBTAIN AND- TO PRODUCE. I DON'T GET A DAY BUT I PROMISE WE'RE GOING TO WORK VERY HARD TO. AND WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE OVER THIS ARE GOING TO WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE WE ROLLED OUT AS FAST AS WE CAN. RIGHT AT IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT- WILL CREATE GREATER EFFICIENCIES. AND WEALTH YES S. C. H. B. SO ARE- FINAL ISSUE MR BENNETT DOESN'T HAVE A QUESTION LOOKS LIKE HE DOESN'T- IS- ISSUE FIFTEEN. BASELINE COST INCREASES FOR IT. AND I THINK THIS ONE KIND OF BRING SAID KIND OF SUMMARIZES EVERYTHING ALMOST AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY BECAUSE IT ALL KIND OF CULMINATES HERE WITH OUR- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BASS LINE WHERE WE ARE REQUESTING A ONE TIME FUNDING OF FIFTEEN MILLION- IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FOR THE MOTOR VEHICLE COW ACCOUNT TO COVER INCREASED TECHNOLOGY COSTS- OVERALL BECAUSE AS A C. H. P. CONTINUES TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICE. AND SAFETY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PROGRAMS THAT APARTMENT HAS EXPERIENCE IN NINETY AN INCREASE IN ALL OF OUR IT COSTS MORE SPECIFICALLY THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO LEVERAGE NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE EFFICIENCIES AND BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC. THESE NEW TECH SOLUTIONS THEY RESULT IN IMPROVED DELIVERY OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND SERVICE TO THOSE RESIDING TRAVEL WITHIN CALIFORNIA. THE BASELINE COSTS FOR THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN THE INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT NECESSARILY LIMITED TO AN APARTMENT- COMPUTER AIDED DISPATCH SYSTEMS. THE STATE WIDE NETWORK UPGRADES SOFTWARE LICENSING STATE WHY WIRELESS INSTALLATIONS OF MODEM REPLACEMENTS. I DISASTER RECOVERY FOR EXAMPLE- MICROSOFT AZURE CLOUD SERVICES. WE ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE PERFORMING HIS MISSION CRITICAL DUTIES DURING AND AFTER A CATASTROPHIC EVENT. PRIVACY RISK MANAGEMENT CYBERSECURITY THREAT ASSESSMENT AND CLOUD COMPUTING SO IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT STRATEGIC PLAN AND TO MEET THE CURRENT FEDERAL ESTATE TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS THE CHP IS CONTINUALLY UPDATING OUR IT INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO INCREASE OUR NETWORK SECURITY. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ONLINE SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC AND TO PROVIDE OFFICERS WITH TECHNOLOGY BASED TOOLS THAT ENABLE THEM TO DEDICATE MORE TIME TO MISSION CRITICAL DUTIES FOR EXAMPLE- FOR EXAMPLE TO ALLOW OFFICERS TO EFFECTIVELY PERFORM PATROL DUTIES. THE DEPARTMENT IS SUPPLIED OFFICES WITH TABLETS- TO ASSIST TO ASSIST THEM WITH THE AUTOMATION OF MANUAL PAPER BASED TASKS. SUCH AS CITATIONS IN THOSE THINGS THAT AND ALLOW THE OFFICERS TO PERFORM A VARIETY OF DUTIES MORE EFFICIENTLY AT THE SCENE. AT THE BUZZER THIS BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO COVER INCREASED COMPUTING SUPPORT COSTS AND COMPLETE NECESSARY IT PROJECTS WITH PROVEN PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES. SO ALTHOUGH RIGHT THE SERVER. RIGHT IT BY THE BCPS. WE NAY UNDERSTAND THAT REFLECTS IN IN OF UP. THIRTEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. AND BASS LINE BECAUSE OVER THE LAST DECADE AND THE TABLE IN THE B. C. P. HOWEVER IT DOES NOT INCLUDE CRITICAL UPGRADES TO AGING INFRASTRUCTURE OUR FUTURE PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT WHICH ARE ESTIMATED TO COST AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. AND ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION WE'LL FIND THE MODERNIZATION OF THE ACADEMY INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE VIRTUALIZATION OF DIVISION AND OFFICE. SO ULTIMATELY THIS PROPOSAL SUPPORTS OUR IS OUR STRATEGIC PLAN TO PROVIDE QUALITY SERVICE TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES ENHANCE TRANSPORTATION SAFETY AND OBTAIN TRANSPARENCY AND EFFECTIVE REPORTING ON PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES.
