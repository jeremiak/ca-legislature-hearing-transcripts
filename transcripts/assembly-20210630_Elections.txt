WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME GREAT SO BRING IT BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE HAVE A MOTION WE HAVE A SECOND MISTER BENNETT. I APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR BAKER APPRECIATE BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED TO AFTER BEING INVOLVED IN SOME DISPUTES- IN OUR COUNTY YEAH WE'RE I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR. WITH THE DEGREE OF DISCRETION THAT WAS BEING USED AND IT DEPENDED ON THE PERSON AND THEIR JUDGMENT THAT. AND ALL OF THAT SO I APPRECIATE THIS MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS. IN THAT STANFORD STUDY WITH ABLE TO IDENTIFY A HUNDRED THOUSAND BALLOTS WERE WERE VIEW- DEEM TO BE- HAVE AN APPROPRIATE SIGNATURES. DID ANYBODY DO ANY FOLLOW UP TO FIND OUT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE WERE ACTUALLY SENT IN BY THE A VALID VOTER IF THEY JUST SIMPLY TO. MAKE. THEIR SIGNATURE MATCH WHAT WAS ON FILE. OF THE HIGH THOUSAND I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME- AND- DO THINK OUR PRIDE WE HAD SOME OTHER WITNESSES IN THE- PREVIOUS HEARING FROM STANFORD I THINK I CAN GET YOU THAT INFORMATION. THAT THAT WAS REJECTED IN TOTAL- NOT JUST OF THOSE SPECIFICALLY IN THE SIGNATURE BUT IT'S STILL IT'S QUITE WHY THEY WENT. AND THEY FOUND OUT THAT EACH COUNTY. WAS DOING IT IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY SO THAT'S WHEN THEY START WORKING WITH THEN. ASSERTIVE STATE PATEA AND TO TRY TO STANDARDIZE- BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT EXACT SEVEN I CAN GET THAT FOR YOU AFTER WITH STANDARDIZATION SHOULD INCREASE EVERYBODY'S CONFIDENCE EXACTLY WHEN THE RESULTS AND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SIR THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SAYING NONE. CENTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I AFTER ASK RIVAL. ARE RIGHT. WITH THE PRICE 90% OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS ALREADY RECEIVING A BALLOT IN THE MAIL IT'S IMPERATIVE WE HAVE UNIFORM STATEWIDE SIGNATURE VERIFICATION RULES AND GUIDELINES. THIS BILL REFINED THE PROCESS FOR VOTERS TO CORRECT MISSING OR MISMATCHED SIGNATURES ON THEIR VOTE. BY MAIL BALLOTS AND REQUIRES CONSISTENT BALLOT REJECTION REPORTING ACROSS THE STATE- I FIND MYSELF A LITTLE CONFLICTED. BECAUSE I YEAH THIS IS THIS YEAH I CAME FROM A STUDY FROM STANFORD I NOW REPRESENT STANFORD AS WELL CENTER BACKER- BUT SAID THAT- BUT STANFORD DID REJECT ME THREE TIMES. SO THEY CLEARLY HAVE TERRIBLE JUDGMENT SO I'M NOT SURE. ABOUT THE YOU KNOW INTELLIGENCE OF THIS THIS PROPOSALBUT WE'LL GO WITH IT FOR NOW. HAPPY TO RECOMMEND SUPPORT WITHIN THEM AS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL VOTE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN- HI. BERMAN I SAY ARE CHAU ON YOUR BEHALF MARK NO. THANK YOU SENT A OUR CHILDREN NOW THEN IT. THEN IT HI LOW.

FORTY ONE THAT'S OUT THAT'S OUT FOR ONE OKAY THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS- IT'S CENTER BACK OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO MOVE ON TO YOUR NEXT BILL IT SB FIVE OH FOUR. I WILL THANK YOU. SO CALIFORNIANS HAVE CONTINUED TO SHOW STRONG DESIRE TO ENFRANCHISED. JUSTICE INVOLVED AND FORMERLY INCARCERATED VOTERS. HOWEVER THIS IS REALLY BEEN HINDERED BY INCOMPLETE AND INACCURATE INFORMATION. THAT LEAVES ELECTION OFFICIALS MAKING EDUCATED GUESSES AS THE POINT WAS MADE EARLIER. AS A TEMP TO KEEP VOTER REGISTRATION RECORDS UP TO DATE. ADDITIONALLY MILITARY OVERSEE VOTERS AS WELL DISABLED VOTERS ARE CURRENTLY BARRED. FROM UTILIZING SAME DAY OR CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION OPTIONS. THAT ARE AVAILABLE. TO VOTERS. IN STATE GIVEN THE GEOGRAPHIC FOR MOBILITY LIMITATIONS. SB FIVE BEFORE WILL ENSURE BETTER MANAGEMENT BUT JUSTICE INVOLVED CALIFORNIANS IN A VOTER ROLLS BY STREAMLINING BASIC MAINTENANCE PROCESSES FOR EXAMPLE CDCR WILL BE REQUIRED TO SEND A WEEKLY FEED DIRECTLY TO ALL THE COUNTY REGISTRARS. AND CORRECTED AND HAVE VERY CLEAR INFORMATION IT ALSO EXTENDS EXISTING VOTER REGISTRATION OPTIONS TO ALL VOTERS WHETHER IN STATE AT HOME FOR SERVING OVERSEAS. I THINK THAT YOUR STAFF FOR THE CHILDREN PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE FOR THIS BILL WE HAVE OF RYAN ROCCO WAS A PLASTER COUNTY CLERK. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS AND ELECTION OFFICIALS ON THE LINE. GREAT THANK YOU CENTER RECORDS SO WHEN I MOVED TO PRIMER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- MISTER RONCO I BELIEVE- HE WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE A QUICK. WE NOW HAVE VISUAL. WE'LL GET A LAST MINUTE SUB OKAY- TRICIA WEBER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS IN ELECTIONS OFFICIALS I BELIEVE IS TESTIFYING- VIA TELEPHONE. THE MORNING CARE BERMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY YES I AM SURE SHOW EVER. THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY CLERK REGISTRAR OF VOTERS AND THE CO CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS AND ELECTION OFFICIALS LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE- I'M CONTAINING FOR RYAN WHO HAD A LAST MINUTE CHANGE OF SCHEDULE. WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONSOR SB FIVE OH FOUR. I'D LIKE TO THANK SENATOR BACKGROUND AND STAFF FOR THEIR IMPORTANT WORK ON THE BILL. SB FIVE OH FOUR SIX TO FIX A DESIGN FLAW IN THE CURRENT LAW WITH RESPECT TO CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION. RIGHT NOW CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION REQUIRES THE PERSON WISHING TO REGISTER AND VOTE FOURTEEN DAYS PRIOR TO AND THROUGH ELECTION DAY TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT EITHER AT. THE ELECTION OFFICIALS OFFICE RIGHT APPOINT PLACER VOTE CENTER IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THAT REGISTRATION AND THEN VOTE. HOWEVER THIS LEADS OVERSEE CITIZENS MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY DEPLOYED BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD AND HOMEBOUND DISABLED CITIZENS OUT OF LUCK IF THEY WISH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LATE VOTER REGISTRATION. AND VOTING. TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM SB FIVE OH FOUR ALLOWS MILITARY AND OVERSEAS CITIZENS WHO ACCESSED CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION OPPORTUNITIES AND HAVE THEIR BALLOTS DELIVERED TO THEM THROUGH THEIR COUNTIES REMOTE ACCESSIBLE VOTE BY MAIL SYSTEM. DOES PLACING THEM ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH THEIR STATESIDE COUNTERPARTS. IT ALSO ALLOWS DISABLED CITIZENS WHO CANNOT PHYSICALLY APPEAR TO REGISTER AND VOTE DURING THIS PERIOD ANOTHER OPTION TO PARTICIPATE. SB FIVE OH FOUR ALSO IMPROVES VOTER FILE MAINTENANCE BY HAVING THE DATA FOR THOSE IMPRISONED FOR A FELONY CONVICTION HELLO DIRECTLY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION INTO VOEPEL OUR STATEWIDE VOTER DATABASE. CURRENTLY REGISTRARS ACROSS THE STATE RECEIVE DATA ON JUSTICE INVOLVED PERSONS FROM THEIR COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT ON A PERIODIC BASIS. HOWEVER THIS DATA FROM SUPERIOR COURT CAN BE INCOMPLETE R LACKING IMPORTANT MATCHING CRITERIA LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY OR DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER. THESE ARE ITEMS THAT WE USE TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITH COMMON NAMES AND SIMILAR BIRTHDATE. THIS BILL WILL MANDATE THAT INFORMATION AUTOMATE THE PROCESS AND INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF DATA SUBMISSION WHICH WILL IMPROVE VOTER REGISTRATION FILE MAINTENANCE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS TODAY THANK YOU CAN I AM AVAILABLE TO HELP ENERGY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE WONDERFUL THANK YOU MS WEBER. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ANY PRIMER WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION WHICH WE HAVE NONE SO WILL NOW MOVE ON TO- ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE OH FOUR AS A REMINDER THE PUBLIC WILL FIFTEEN MINUTES IN TOTAL TIME.

ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL IMPROVES THE ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY OF CONVICTION DATE OF THAT ELECTION OFFICIALS RECEIVED THEREBY IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF THE VOTER ROLLS AND ENSURING THAT ELIGIBLE VOTERS ARE NOTIFIED WHEN THE VOTING RIGHTS ARE RESTORED FOR THESE REASONS I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL VOTE. THE MOST IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY BERMAN HI BERMAN I SEE ARE TAILORED SEE OUR TO A BANDIT BANDIT HI LOW. MAYES MAYES AYE MULLIN BLANCA RUBIO BLANCA RUBIO I THAT BILLS OUT WITH FIVE VOTES WILL BE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. THANK YOU SENATOR KERR. NECK I WE HAVE CENTER ALAN- WITH. TWO BILLS ON THE AGENDA TODAY AS BEFORE FOUR FIFTY NINE AND SB SEVEN FIFTY TWO. WOULD YOU LIKE TO START WITH SB FOUR FIFTY NINE CENTER. AS YOU WISH MISTER CHAIR. AS GOOD A BILL AS ANY ALL RIGHT- WELL FIRST OFF THANK YOU HI. MR CHIU I WANNA I WANNA YOU AND I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS LISTENING HOUSES- AND WE WORK REALLY CLOSELY TOGETHER I APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK. I AM AND IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL SERIES OF AMENDMENTS THAT BECAUSE WE REALLY DID WANT TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE WERE DOING NOTHING MORE THAN WAS ACTUALLY NECESSARY TO REACH OUR TRANSPARENCY GOALS- I THINK IS. ELECTED OFFICIALS OUT WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE ALL SPENT ON COMPLIANCE. WITH THE- HAVE A FILE ARE OUR FILINGS AND- YOU KNOW I BELIEVE IN THE RULES THAT STATUS TO THAT PLACE BUT- EXTRANEOUS FILINGS AND- DO NOTHING BUT CAUSE. TROUBLE AND BUREAUCRATIC NIGHTMARES AND DON'T REALLY PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY FOR FOLKS. WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. IS PROVIDING THE PUBLIC THE PRESS AND- SOME RESPECTS JUST AS IMPORTANT MORE IMPORTANT. FELLOW LAWMAKERS MORE TIMELY AND USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT TO INFLUENCE THE FATE OF LEGISLATION IN CALIFORNIA. SO IN OUR STATE LOBBYING FIRMS AND INTEREST GROUPS HIRING THAT MUST FILE QUARTERLY REPORTS ON THEIR LOBBYING ACTIVITY ONE MONTH AFTER THE CLOSE OF EACH QUARTER. SO THE THIRD QUARTER REPORT. OUR COVERAGE THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL AND MOST SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATIVE QUARTER OF THE YEAR AS JULY TO SEPTEMBER WHICH OF COURSE INCLUDES THE END OF SESSION. NOW WE ALL KNOW WHAT WE MOST OF US KNOW. YOU SEVEN OUT HERE KNOWS THE CHAOS OF THE END OF SESSION- MILLIONS OF DOLLARS LITTLE YOUR SPENT- TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION. BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS THE DISCLOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACTS. THE LOBBYING CONTRACTS THAT DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL AFTER THE LEGISLATURE IS ACTUALLY ALREADY DECIDED WHICH BILLS TO PASS OR DEFEAT AND IN FACT AFTER THE GOVERNOR. HAS DECIDED WHICH BILLS TO SIGN OR VETO. SO THIS ULTIMATELY FAILS TO PROVIDE ANY USEFUL REAL TIME. I OR EVEN CLOSE TO TIME DISCLOSURES ARE TRANSPARENCY WHEN THAT WHILE THE FATE OF LEGISLATION IS DECIDED. TO NEARLY HALF OF THE STATE IN THE UNION. VIED FOR MONTHLY REPORTING OR IN SOME INSTANCES MORE EVEN MORE FREQUENT REPORTING. I HADN'T IT'S MY STRONG FEELING THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT POLICYMAKERS THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC HAVE MORE TIMELY AND USEFUL INFORMATION. ABOUT THE LOBBYING IMPACTING PUBLIC POLICY. I THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE- FOLKS OR SOMETHING COMING IN IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO OUR OWN BILLS. WE HAVE AN AND HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY'RE WORKING FOR- AND EXACTLY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THE PLAY AS- SO WHILE THE COMMITTEE SO NOW. I'M WE DID HAVE A MONTHLY REPORTING REQUIREMENT ARE BILL AND WE'RE TAKING IT OUT. AND YOU KNOW THE ONE WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF OUR BROADER GOAL OF TRYING TO DO NOTHING THAT WE WOULD THAT WOULD BE THAT THAT THEY WOULD CAUSE A LOT OF UNNECESSARY PAPERWORK WITHOUT PROVIDING THE GOALS THAT. WE HAVE IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY ESPECIALLY AT THE END OF SESSION BUT HERE'S THE IMPORTANT THING. THE BILL'S GOING TO REQUIRE REPORTING FOR ALL NEWLY HIRED LOBBYISTS WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF THEY'RE HIRED WITHIN THE LAST SIXTY DAYS OF SESSION. IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT DETAILING WHAT BILLS THEY'RE WORKING ON AND WHAT WHICH CLIENT POSITION A REPRESENTING. WITHIN THAT THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THEY BEGIN LOBBYING. UNDER THE BILL QUARTERLY REPORTS SO WE'RE WE'RE GETTING RID OF THE MONTHLY REPORTING RQUIREMENT BUT WE'RE- SLIGHTLY EXPANDING THE QUARTERLY REPORT REQUIREMENTS. SO THOSE QUARTERLY REPORTS WOULD BE EXPANDED SO THAT WE COULD SEE NOT JUST WHAT BILLS WERE LOBBIED ON BUT THE POSITION TAKEN. I HAVE YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT GIVING FOLKS THE OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW WHO'S LOBBYING FOR AND AGAINST LEGISLATION HOW LOBBYING INFLUENCES LAWS BEING MADE. ON THE OTHER IMPORTANT THING TO MENTION IS THAT WE'RE SEEING A PLETHORA OF. OF ADVOCACY BASED ADVERTISEMENTS. THAT ARE JUST BEING DIRECTED TO US AND TO OUR STAFF THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. I'D LIKE A FULL PAGE AD IN THE SACRAMENTO BEE WHICH IS OPEN TO ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC TO SEE. ARE THESE ADS ARE ARE BEING MICRO TARGETED AND THEY ARE. BEING BOUGHT TO PROVIDE THE SENSE THAT THERE'S KIND OF A MASSIVE LOBBYING CAMPAIGN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN OR GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN ASSOCIATED WITH THE- SUPPORTER OPPOSITION TO A PARTICULAR BILL USUALLY. I'M OF COURSE THE TRUTH IS IT'S ACTUALLY BEING MICROTARGETING TO US IN IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND- INTO THE INTO THE PRESS. SO I'M SO WE ALSO WANT TO PUT SOME OF THE DISCLOSURE RULES THAT RELATE TO CAMPAIGN ADVERTISING ON TO THESE ISSUE ADVOCACY CAMPAIGNS. I SAID IT NOW YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE TO REPORT SPENDING ON ADS WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS INTO THE BILL. AND ALSO REQUIRES IT INTEREST GROUPS TO PUT THEIR NAMES ON THE ADS- THERE'S A- SOME OF YOURS I WAS LOOKING ROUGH AND TUMBLE THE OTHER DAY AND- IT'S AMAZING HOW MANY DIFFERENT. MODES THE ADVERTISERS ARE TAKING SOME ARE BEING VERY. UP FRONT ABOUT WHO'S PAYING FOR THEIR ADS OTHERS ARE LEGALLY PRESENTING NO INFORMATION WHATSOEVER AS TO WHO'S- WHO'S PAYING FOR THE ADS SO. HOW WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS WE WANT TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS I WHO REPRESENT THE- THE THIRD HOUSE THE pWITH THEM SEVERAL TIMES AND ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM TO GET TO A PLACE. WHERE WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS BILL- THE BILL RECEIVED BIPARTISAN VERY STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE SENATE I AND THEY WILL PROVIDE COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS FOR ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY IN OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THE PUBLIC THE PRESS LIKE IT OFFICIALS DESERVE. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS JONATHAN STEIN WHOSE EXECUTIVE COMMON CAUSE INDOOR ROSE ANOTHER EXECUTIVE THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS. THANK YOU- CENTER ALLEN ENDS I BELIEVE- BOTH. JONATHAN MATTISE DIçN INDOOR ROSE ARE TESTIFYING BY TELEPHONE OPERATOR IF YOU COULD- IDENTIFYING OPEN THEIR LINES AND REMINDER- WHEN THIS ISN'T SUPPORT HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH. INFO SIGNS ARE OPEN. SURE BERMAN AND MEMBERS GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JONATHAN ABOUT THE STEIN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA COMMON COST OUT WE ARE SPONSORED BEFORE NINE MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO UP FRONT OFFER MY SINCERE GRATITUDE OF COURSE CENTER ALLEN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP BUT ALSO TO YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL COSIDERATION OF THIS BILL AND HERE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR EXCELLENT WORK. SB FOUR FIFTY NINE DOES SUPPORT THE FIRST TO CREATE A REAL TIME TRANSPARENCY ABOUT BOBBING IN THE CAPITAL AT THE END OF SESSION BOB REPORTING BECOME POORLY UNDER OUR MENTION MEANING THAT THE DISCLOSURES THAT OFFER YOU YOUR STAFF AND THE PUBLIC THE CHANCE TO KNOW WHO IS LOBBYING WHAT AT THE END OF SESSION COME AFTER ANY OF THAT INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY USEFUL. IF AN INTEREST GROUP HIRED LOBBYISTS RIGHT YEAH THE SECTION WE DON'T FIND OUT UNTIL AFTER THE LEGISLATURE ADJOURNS AND THE BILL TARGETED HAVE BEEN KILLED OR PASSED OUT WHAT BUT THEY WERE LOBBYING ON PEOPLE HAVE NOT CHANGED THAT THE LAWMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY. WHO HAS BEEN HIRED TO LOBBY AGAINST BILLS. BACK SB FORTY NINE WOULD REQUIRE FILER AND BOBBY. WHO HAVE ALL. WITH WHICH BILL THEY LOBBIED ON. TO ALSO. THAT TAKEN ON THE OF THOSE THAT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CAR SENSE SHOW THOUGH IT MAY LOBBYIST ORDERS MORE. THIRD SB FORTY NINE INCREASE THE- PANTS. AND ON ISSUES. ECONOMICALLY AND ON IT PRESSURE WHILE. FOR THE FIRST TIME THOSE AT HAPTIC THE NAME OF THE INTEREST GROUP PAID FOR THE- FOURTH AND FINALLY THE BILL BECAUSE SMALL CHANGES THANK A LOT OF REPORTING MORE MODERNIZED AND IF YOU'RE GONNA LOBBYIST THEMSELVES. WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT AND A CHANCE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS BILL. AMONG THE MEMBERS TO GET THE BACK MANY STAFF WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE HAVE AGREED TO AMEND THE BILL. THAT WOULD NOT GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL ONE FULL YEAR AFTER THE NEW CAL ACT THAT LOBBYIST OF THE SYSTEM GOES LIVE.

I THINK WE'VE GOT REALLY MEANINGFUL WAYS TO CHECK. THE PUBLIC PROMISES ESPECIALLY THE PROMISES OF LARGE CORPORATIONS MATCH THEIR LOBBYING ACTIVITIES. THE PUBLIC THE PRESS LEGISLATORS THAT WE ALL DESERVE IT INSIDE IS A SPECIAL INTERESTS THAT MY PEOPLE HAVING BEHIND THE SCENES TO PROMOTED TO KILL BILL. AND THE TIMING ON THIS DISCLOSURE IS REALLY CRITICAL RIGHT IT DOESN'T HELP TO FIND OUT WHO SPENDING MILLIONS TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION AFTER IT'S ALREADY SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. THAT'S INFORMATION WE ALL NEED TO HAVE ALL THE STOPPAGES BEING MADE. SB FOUR FIFTY NINE WE'RE WILL IMPROVE LOBBYING TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING SPECIFIC POSITIONS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN ON THE L. G. NOTED IN QUARTERLY REPORTS SO WE KNOW PEOPLE WHERE PEOPLE STAND- IT'S ALSO GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET. TIMELY DISCLOSURES OF NEW LOBBYISTS AND THEIR WORK DURING THAT. PERIOD AT THE END OF SESSION. OPEN THIS IS REALLY GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL TO THE PROCESS OVERALL. YOU KNOW IF IT'S CLEAR WHERE EVERYONE STANDS ON A BILL THERE'S JUST A MORE NATURAL EXCHANGE IDEAS THAT UNFOLDS AND THAT GIVEN TAKE REALLY ULTIMATELY LEAD TO IMPROVED LEGISLATIVE OUTCOMES SO THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORT SB FOUR FIFTY NINE. WE THANK SENATOR ALAN FOR HIS EADERSHIP ON MATTERS OF TRANSPARENCY AND GOOD GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL WE URGE I. THANK YOU.

THE TWO AREAS THAT I WILL HIGHLIGHT TONIGHT TO THIS MORNING WILL BE ONE THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT I DON'T KNOW THAT I. G. HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR REPORTING AS A CONCEPT IN IN IN IN PRACTICE. HOWEVER THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT DOES IT CREATE AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN PARTICULARLY ON THE SMALL SOLE PROPRIETOR SHOPS WHERE AT THE END THE SESSION PARTICULARLY THE SIXTY DAYS WE FIND OURSELVES CONSTANTLY BEING APPROACHED BY OUR COLLEAGUES WHO ARE WORKING ON ISSUES. TO JOIN IN EFFORTS ON BILLS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN RECENTLY AMENDED COMING OUT OF EITHER THE LAST POLICY COMMITTEE OR OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS AND OFTEN TIMES GOING INTO THE PREPARATIONS FOR INSTANCE THE BILL WON'T HAVE THE MOMENTS THAT WILL MAKE ANY INDIVIDUAL LOBBYIST FOR OTHER CLIENTS OPPOSED HOWEVER COMING OUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IT DOES AND THEN THERE'S A SHORT TURNAROUND TIME. UNTIL THE BILL HITS THE FLOOR AND THIRTY MORE SECONDS HAVING THAT REQUIREMENT IS GOING TO BE A BURDEN ON THE SOLE PROPRIETORS OF PARTICULARLY IF IT'S A OF LARGE DRAFT THE BILLS. THE SECOND ISSUE I WOULD BRING UP IS A FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE SORT OF WRAP. AROUND THE ISSUE ADVOCACY. WE HAPPENS IF I PUT MY AD MY TO OR MY- I. G. POST.

REQUIREMENT RIGHT IT'S ALMOST AS IF THAT'S ALMOST- INDIRECT PRIOR RESTRAINT BECAUSE IT SAYS TO ME- I CAN'T DO THIS OR SHOULDN'T DO THIS BECAUSE I CAN'T REPORT WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. ALSO I'M ALSO A LITTLE BIT BOTHERED BY THE LACK OF RECIPROCITY. WERE RECIPROCAL. OBLIGATION ON THE LEGISLATOR THE LAW MAKER OR THE OFFICIAL THEMSELVES. BECAUSE THEY CAN TWEET OR OR IG POST.

YES SIR NOT SO BUT IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY MAKING SOME OF US SOME GOOD POINT THAT BUT I'M INCLINED JUST TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF- OF THIS BILL BECAUSE ESPECIALLY- IN REGARD TO THE TRANSPARENCY IN THOSE FINAL. COUPLE OF MONTHS- BUT IF YOU CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SORT OF THAT TWENTY FOUR HOUR APPEAR TO NOTE FOR POLITICAL CAMPAIGN FOR ALL USED TO THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR REPORTING PERIOD. I THINK IN REGARDS THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS IT MAKES AND THAT MAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF SENSE I'M NOT SURE THAT. THAT THAT TWENTY FOUR HOURS- IS THE BEST ONE ON YES THE ADDRESS THAT FRIDAY AFTERNOON- IS THERE SOME WAY THAT YOU CAN GET THE THAT YOU GUYS CAN GET THEIR BE BEYOND THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS MAYBE MAY HAVE THAT THE AUTHOR. TO TALK ABOUT IT I MEAN IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE BILL IT'S THE WORK THAT WE'VE WE'RE IT WE WENT IT SEVENTY TWO HOURS FOR THEM REPORTER. ISSUE AT SPENDING AS OPPOSED TO TWENTY FOUR. WELL IF THAT'S NOT THE CASE THAT GET THAT FOR. BLOOD THE A THERE'S REQUIRE IN THEIR I READ CORRECTLY THAT IT'S TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO USE THE INDIVIDUAL. LEGISLATOR THAT IS. MENTIONED OR THE ISSUE THAT YOU'RE CARRYING IS MENTIONED IT SEVENTY TWO HOURS TO THE APPROPRIATE RECEIVING. ENTITY RIGHT AHA SO THAT'S THAT'S THE ISSUES LIKE IT'S TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO. YOU KNOW IF I DO AN ISSUE THAT. HAS DEFINED IN THE BILL- OR MY CLIENT DOES ONE WE HAVE TO COME AND TALK YOU KNOW SEND YOU COMMUNICATIONS- THAT SAYS WE'RE DOING THE ALBUM THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT THIS IS WHERE AN AND WE ALSO HAVE TO. SAY A WORD WAS POSTED IN ALL THOSE DIFFERENT ADDITIONAL- BITS OF INFORMATION. SO I JUST WANT THEM THINKING THERE IF THAT CAN BECAUSE I COULDN'T AGAIN UNDERSTAND FOR TRANSPARENCY SAKE WE WANT WHEN WE HAVE INFORMATION I AGREE WITH- THE AUTHOR ON THIS THAT ESPECIALLY. TOWARDS THE END DOES THE WHEN THINGS ARE GOING CRAZY- THAT LAST- A COUPLE OF WEEKS. IN IN PARTICULAR- BUT PEOPLE ARE SHOWING UP IN YOUR OFFICE ARETALKING ABOUT THESE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE WHO THEY REPRESENT A WHAT. A WHAT'S GOING I DO THINK THAT THAT SUPPORT I JUST WONDER IF THAT TWENTY FOUR HOURS IS TOO SHORT MAYBE THAT SHOULD EXTEND A LITTLE BIT LONGER MAYBE WE CAN WE CAN GET THERE. CAN I JUST ADD ONE MORE JUST ADDITIONAL THING FOR THE- ORDER AND THIRD CHAIR IF I MAY PLEASE- THERE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE INFORMATION AND IN PARTICULAR THE MATTER OF THE ACTION RIGHT. I CAN SEE AN ISSUE IN THE BILL IN DURING THE LEGISLATIVE YEAR BUT AT THE END THE SESSION WHEN WERE IN THAT SORT OF INTRUM PERIOD WERE WERE IN OCTOBER NOVEMBER. AND THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT IS COMING UP AND WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE AN ISSUE FOR NEXT YEAR. THIS ALMOST SEEMS LIKE- AND THE MEANS TO IDENTIFY EARLY. IN ISSUE THAT MAY BE COMING IN JANUARY. TO THE- POSSIBLE DETRIMENT OF THE PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE ADVOCATING FOR THAT ISSUE BECAUSE- OFTENTIMES WE MEAN THAT. ACTUALLY INTRODUCED THE BILL BECAUSE OF ALL THE WORK WE DO IN THE FALL DETERMINES THAT IS EITHER CAN'T PASS. WHAT'S NOT THE ISSUE THAT WE THOUGHT IT WAS. BUT WE DON'T EVEN GET THE CHART THAT CHANCE TO BE DELIBERATIVE. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO REPORT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME. KIND OF ACTIVITY ON THAT. MATTER OF THAT. OR THE ISSUE. AND SO MY CONCERN WOULD BE REALLY REPORT HE- JUST IN THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR FOR JUST THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO REPORT. SOME ISSUE. ADD AROUND AN ISSUE THAT HASN'T EVEN BECOME A BILL YET. IS A CONCERN TO THE LARGER COMMUNITY THAT I REPRESENT. IN THIS CAPACITY. AS A VOLUNTEER PRESIDENT. SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE TAKING OUT AN AD. AT THE END OF SESSION OR SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO WORK ON IN THE FUTURE YEAH WE'RE SETTING THE YOU KNOW YOU'RE SETTING THE PREDICATE RESETTING THE PRESIDENT OR- YOU KNOW EVEN WITH THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT RIGHT. LIKE I' REPORTING ON POTENTIALLY ON SOMETHING THAT I MEAN THAT MAY NEVER BECOME THE BILL AS A LOBBYIST SO. PROBABLY LESSER OF A CONCERN BUT IF I'M TRYING. OR MY- CLIENTS ARE TRYING OR ANYONE'S TRYING. TO YOU KNOW AFFECT. IN YOU KNOW LEGISLATION FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR IN THE FALL BY DOING SOME ADS TO GO AND YOU KNOW GET PEOPLE SORT OF SENSITIZED TO THE ISSUE THAT BECOMES REPORTABLE WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S NECESSARILY A BAD THING BUT THE MODALITY IS THAT IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH SOME SORT OF LEGISLATIVE ACTION THAT HASN'T ACTUALLY. HEARD YET THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH I MEAN IN TERMS pCHAIR AT YOU KNOW A MONTH SO WE TURN TO THE REGULATION OF THESE ADS AT THE END OF SESSION MY PRIMARY INTEREST IS FOCUSED ON. THE INFLUENCE RELATING TO THE VOTES THAT ARE GONNA HAPPEN IN THE LEGISLATURE SO IF IT'S A MATTER OF CLARIFYING THAT THIS HAS TO BE THAT THAT IT WILL BE THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THE THAT THE QUICK REPORT. AT THE END OF SESSION RULES WOULD WOULD KICK IN FOR ADVOCACY DIRECTLY RELATING TO. TO ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE BY THE END OF SESSION I'M HAPPY TO GET THAT CLEARED UP IF I PUSH IT AT THE TIME BECAUSE IN THE END OF THE DAY YOU'RE RIGHT I MEAN IT THE TRANSPARENCY CONCERNS THE THIRD QUICK TRANSPARENCY. CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH. ADVERTISING A BRA ISSUE IS NOT AS A CUTE LITTLE AS WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING IN LAST MINUTE PLAYS. FOR AS YOU ADDS. UP REALLY TO BILLS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING UP FOR A VOTE WITHIN A COUPLE DAYS YEAH. AND I WOULD EVEN GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER WELL. SEPARATE BUT RELATED IS. IF WE'RE REPORTING IN SEVENTY TWO HOURS TO A FEW PC OR SECTORS THAT WHOEVER REPORTING TO- IS IT STILL NECESSARY TO REPORT TO THE INDIVIDUAL LEGISLATOR AND WITHIN A TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD OF TIME. BREATHLESS I'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. YEAH AND- THANK YOU PRISM IS A MESS. MISTER BENNETT OF. FOR THOSE OF US THAT OF. FOR THOSE OF US THAT- ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN POLITICS WE'VE BEEN LEFT- BY THE SUPREME COURT ESSENTIALLY WITH TRANSPARENCY AS THOSE REALLY THE ONLY TOOL- THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS TO TRY TO INCREASING TRANSPARENCY AT A CRITICAL TIME AND I HAVEN'T LIVED THROUGH THAT YET BUT THAT SAID AND ASCENSION- INTENSITY- SO I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS. BUT I DO KNOW THAT- THE OFTENTIMES THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF- SOME ACTION DON'T GET POINTED OUT- BY INTEREST GROUPS UNTIL THEY'VE HAD TIME TO SEE THE LEGISLATION AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. SO I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR. HAS COME TODAY AND SAID I'M TRYING. I'M TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IS COMMONSENSE THING AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYMORE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THEN- I WANT TO TRY TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO SO. THIS DIALOGUE HAS BEEN HELPFUL TO GIVE ME MORE CONFIDENCE THAT- AS EASY AS PEOPLE RAISE ISSUES OF THAT THERE'S A GOOD FAITH EFFORT BEING MADE TO TRY TO NARROW THIS DOWN TO THE SPECIFIC GOALS THAT- THE AUTHORS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. AND AT THE SAME TIME TRY TO AVOID THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THAT ARE OUT THERE SO- WITH THAT. I HI I GREW CENTER RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A GOOD FAITH EFFORT BEING MADE AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONTINUING- I THINK THAT FOR EXAMPLE. GETTING IT CLARIFIED TODAY THAT. THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION IS WHO'S LOBBYING ON A BILL BUT AT THE END OF SESSION RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE INTENDED FOR- ADVOCACY AT THE END OF OCTOBER WHEN WE'RE NOT IN SESSION AND THE BILL HASN'T EVEN BEEN CREATED SO PERHAPS. CLARIFYING THAT IS ONLY FOR BILLS THAT ARE ACTUALLY IT IN A- THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF ADVOCACY ON INITIATIVES ETCETERA THAT UNTIL THE INITIATIVE IS ACTUALLY FILED THE- YOU DON'T HAVE THE SAME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AS AFTER IT'S FILED THE SAME THING COULD BE HAPPENING WITH THAT SO. ANYWAY I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS AND THE GOOD FAITH AND INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION OR HAVEN'T BECAUSE COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION IS BUT CLOSER TO GOOD GOVERNMENT- THAN THAT THAN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO THANK YOU. SEEMS BENT MISTER. CHAIRMAN OF OYSTERS SORRY VESTER C. R. DO AND THEN WE'RE GONNA MISTER MULLIN I THANK YOU. SIR ON THE SUBJECT OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS WE WERE WE DO A LOT OF THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ADD MORE AND MORE AND. AND HAVE THEM IN TIGHT WINDOWS. BY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY GET TO. THE DESTINATION OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE DO THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY OF YOU WORK WITH THEM TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HANDLE THIS ADDITIONAL LOAD BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING MORE FRUSTRATING. THAN AND I THINK YOU CAN ASK THE GOVERNOR RIGHT NOW YEAH AND THEN TRYING TO GET ALL YOUR PAPERS IN ON TIME AND THEN YOU GET HIM ON ON TIME AND THEN YOU FIND OUT THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN GET FILED. AND SIX MONTHS LATER YOU'RE BEING FINED FOR SOMETHING AND IT JUST IT JUST WE GOT TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO. ENACT THESE THINGS. THE THROUGH THE CHAIR THE CAR YOU'RE YOUR QUESTION IS SPOT ON IT WAS RAISED IN OUR EARLIER CONVERSATIONS WITH. WITH THEM WITH AGA- SO WE DECIDED TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION THE BILL UNTIL ONE OUT ONE YEAR AFTER CAL ACCESS. IS UP IN THIS PART THIS THIS PORTION OF CHARACTERS UP AS UP AND RUNNING. SO I WHICH YOU KNOW TURNED OUT SO IF THIS BILL PASSES THE ONUS WILL BE ON. THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE TO YOU KNOW. GET GO AND GET THE SYSTEM THAT THEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME UP AND RUNNING AND THEN IT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED A YEAR AFTERWARDS. I THINK OKAY THE MIZ RUSHER WAS MOMENT. THANK MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THE ISSUE AS YOU KNOW I'VE TAKEN A STAB AT IT ISSUE AD DISCLOSURE YEAH AND- ALSO THIS LOBBYING DISCLOSURE FREQUENCY OF REPORTING. AND IT'S GOING TO THAT PROCESS AND I AM PROUD TO BE THAT THE ASSEMBLY CO AUTHOR ON THIS AND APPLY YOU FOR IT IT'S SUPER COMPLICATED IN TERMS OF HOW THE BILLING WORKS AND HOW THE REAL SORT OF LOVING WORLD WORKS AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE CAL ACCESS TECHNOLOGY ISSUE. THIS MULTI LAYERED HERE AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE SINKING UP- THE REBOOT OF CALLOUT ACCESS- WITH YOUR EFFORTS I THINK OF THE FUNCTIONALITY AS PROMISED- IS GOING TO BE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN TERMS OF HOW THIS ACTUALLY WORKS FOR THE PUBLIC BUT- IT'S VERY NEW WANTS AND HOW THESE THINGS WORK AND I APPRECIATE THAT MISSION TO MARS COMMENTS I APPRECIATE YOU ENGAGING THIS JUST WE WANT TO HAVE A- SYSTEM THAT. BOB YOU KNOW BLENDS WITH WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE LOBBYING WORLD IN REALLY MY MOTIVATION WAS IN INITIATING. WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE WHERE THE BIG MONEY IS MOVING LATE IN THE GAME AND THE LAG WAS ALWAYS FRUSTRATING TO ME AND I BY HER. FRANKLY FROM JOURNALISTS WHO SAID. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO TRY TO COVER THIS STUFF BUT BY THE TIME WE SEE THE DISCLOSURE. YOU KNOW THE BILLS ALREADY YOU KNOW- THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE TO THE GOVERNOR. AND THE PUBLIC. DOESN'T HAVE THE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THE BIG DOLLARS ARE MOVING AND THAT WAS AND I APPRECIATE THE THRESHOLD. I YOU PUT IN HERE AS WELL SO- I APPRECIATE THE REFINEMENTS YOU'VE MADE AYE AYE. I'M GRATEFUL YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING IT UP- BLOOD IT ALSO- POINTS TO JUST. NEEDING TO CRAFT SOMETHING. THAT HAS SORT OF- CONTINGENCIES IN PLACE SO WHEN THE CAL ACCESS SYSTEM. IS REBOOTED THAT FUTURE REFINEMENTS COULD BE MADE SO WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT- INCREASES THE TIMELINESS THE PUBLIC HAS A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE THE BIG DOLLARS ARE MOVING- AT THOSE CRITICAL PEAK. AT TIMES IN THE LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR AND I WAS FRUSTRATED BY THAT JUST SORT OF STANDARD QUARTERLY REPORTING THAT DIDN'T SINK WITH THE NATURE. OF THE PEAK TIMES IN THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS AT THE VET HAS ALREADY HELPED MOVE THE BILL. GOT MOTION. FAMOUS MULLIN ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. LOOKING FOR A SECOND GOT COUPLE SECONDS AND A THIRD. CENTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION- YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT IMPROVING THE SYSTEM CREATES MORE TRANSPARENCY FOR US FOR MEMBERS THE PUBLIC. QUITE FRANKLY FOR THE MEMBERS THE LOBBYING CORD TO SOMETIMES YOU KNOW. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE INCREDIBLY ABOVE BOARD AND JUST TRYING TO DO THEIR JOBS- WITH HONOR- AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT IT'S ABOUT PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY IS WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE END. I WANT ALL THESE VOTES ARE HAPPENING SO QUICKLY AND SO MUCH MONEY'S MOVING AROUND AND SO MANY MESSAGES ARE ARE SKATING AROUND. WE ALL DESERVES TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION AS TO AS TO WHAT'S BEHIND THAT- THOSE EFFORTS AND SO ON BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND WITH OUR FRIENDS- YOU KNOW REPRESENTED BY DOMINIC CAT- TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS DONE IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES US WITH THE TRANSPARENCY. THAT WE ALL ARE LOOKING FOR- WHILE AT THE SAME TIME I'M NOT CREATING UNNECESSARY EXTRANEOUS EXTRA PAPERWORK IT DOESN'T PROVIDE US WITH THAT THAT THAT- YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE AND APPRECIATE YOUR ALLOW ME TO WORK FURTHER ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU CENTER AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND ON HIS EFFORTS TO ADDRESS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS OF THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL IMPROVING LOBBYING DISCLOSURE ESPECIALLY DURING THE END OF THE LEGISLATIVE ESSION WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THERE IS MORE TIMELY AND MEANINGFUL INFORMATION ABOUT EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION BUT BUT AS WE SAW TODAY THERE'S STILL SOME DETAILS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT WE WILL WE WERE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE BIG. KIND ITEMS IN IN THE COMMITTEE- I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS PLEDGE TO WORK WITH ME AND COMMITTEE STAFF- YOU KNOW IT DID IT JUST INTO THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THE BILL ON SOME OF THE FINE TUNING SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THAT THAT MIGHT COME UP- AND KEEPING US IN THE LOOP AS AS THAT MOVES FORWARD- BUT HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL WITHIN MOMENTS OF. IN THE CA ALICE. MANAGER CAN JUST THE MY PROPOSAL DOES WANT TO THANK YOU COMMITTEE STAFF. I AND ALSO MCKINLEY ON MY STAFF WHO JUST WORKED REALLY HARD OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS TO GET THIS TO THE TO. TO A- TO A PLACE FOR WORK. WEARING IN GREATER CONCORD SHE'S SHE'S BEEN WORKING QUIETLY HARD I JUST WANNA I WANT TO PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGE HER HARD WORK AGREED TO UNDER PERCENT. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL VOTE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN HI. BERMAN I SAY ARE TERRIBLE TO SEE OUR CHAU NOT VOTING BENNETT. BENNETT HI LO. LO I MAYES. MAYES I MULLIN. MULLIN I BLANCA RUBIO. BLANCA RUBIO I. TWO THREE FOUR THAT BILLS OUT. OF WITH SIX AYE VOTES- IT WOULD YOU LIKE TO MOVE ON YOUR NEXT BILL. SB SEVEN FIFTY TWO SIR. THANK YOU MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR SUPPORT ON THAT LAST BILL ALL RIGHT LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT SB SEVEN FIFTY TWO. I'M I WANT TO ONCE AGAIN THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFERS FOR A HARD WORK ON THIS MEASURE AND I WANT EXCEPT THE MOMENTS THAT ARE SUGGESTED ANNOUNCES THAT HELP TO MAINTAIN DISCLOSE ACT REGULATORY. CONSISTENCY SO IN THE LAST FEW ELECTION CYCLES WE SEE NEW TACTICS ARE USED TO AVOID TRANSPARENCY BY CIRCUMVENTING CURRENT. CAMPAIGN FUNDING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. SO FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS FOR POLITICAL TV ADS ALLOW AD FUNDERS TO MAKE TAXED I'M CLEAR TO VIEWERS AND ONLINE GRAPHIC ADS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DISPLAY ANY TOP. CONTRIBUTORS ASSEMBLY TITIAN SIGNATURE GATHERS HAVE NOT BEEN SHOWING UP SHOWING VOTERS THE LIST OF TOP. FUNDERS OF THE PETITION CAMPAIGN AS REQUIRED BY LAW. AND POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES HAVE UTILIZED A LOOPHOLE TO HIDE THEIR TOP FUNDERS AND LOCAL LEGISLATIVE RACES WITH MANY CONTRIBUTIONS COMING JUST. IN UNDER FIVE FIFTY THOUSAND WHICH IS WHERE WE ACTUALLY SEEN SEVERAL FORTY NINE NINE NINE NINE. CONTRIBUTIONS OF JUST COME IN RIGHT UNDER THE- THE THRESHOLD SO THIS IS A COURSE YOU KNOW I PRETTY. CLEAR TTEMPT TO AVOID DISCLOSURE UNDER THE CURRENT IS CLOSE ACT THRESHOLD SO- THIS BILL UPDATES FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS ON TV AND ONLINE ADVERTISEMENTS TO MAKE DISCLOSURE STATEMENTS MORE EASILY RATHER READABLE. IT LOWERS THE THRESHOLD TO BE CONSIDERED A TOP CONTRIBUTOR AND LOCAL LEGISLATIVE AND FORTY CAUSATION RACES TO TIGHTEN UP THE CONTRIBUTION LOOPHOLE. IT ALSO ADDS A- A TOP FUNDER DISCLOSURE STATEMENT INTO EACH PETITION SIGNATURE BOX OF VOTERS CAN OR MERELY A WHERE THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO THEM. I'M IN THE BILL INCLUDES UPDATES THE TEXT MESAGE DISCLOSURE PROVIDING OPTIONS FOR MORE NATURAL CONVERSATION OVERTAXED- SO THIS BILL WILL BRING WE'VE WE'VE DONE A RAFT OF DISCLOSURE BILLS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THOSE EFFORTS. WE'RE WE'RE JUST WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE LEARNING IN REAL TIME FROM THE- THE WAYS THAT AT TO MAKE TO MAKE THESE VERY DISCLOSURE BILLS A LITTLE STRONGER LITTLE BETTER AND IN SOME RESPECTS MORE SMOOT- BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT PROVIDING- NEED CLARITY TO OUR POLITICAL PROCESS PROVIDING VOTERS WITH VITAL INFORMATION TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS SO. WITH THAT WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY REMOTELY THIS MORNING WE HAVE TRAVELING WITH COMPANY CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN TO MARK POWERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION. GREAT THANK YOU CENTER ALLEN LET'S MOVE ON A PRIMER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT A REMINDER PRIMARY WITNESSES AND SUPPORT EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES. TO TESTIFY. AND FIRST UP IS MISTER JOHN LANG. HI GOOD MORNING SIR BERMAN THE MEMBERS- I'M TERRIFYING PRESENTLY CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN- WERE PROUD TO SPONSOR SB SEVEN FIFTY TWO AND ARE GRATEFUL TO CENTER ALLEN FOR OFFERING IT AND ITS CONTINUED LONG TIME LEADERSHIPIN TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE AND ALSO THIS. THIS COMMITTEE OF COURSE. AND TO THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL- WE DUMP THIS BILL THE DISCLOSURE CLARITY ACT BECAUSE THE CLARIFIES US. FROM REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE THE TOP FUNDERS MORE CLEAR. BUT REALLY COULD BE CALLED THE STOP ABUSES OF THE DISCLOSE ACT ACT- HAS BEEN AROUND DISTRICT. DESCRIBED BY PART OF MAJORITY THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO SHOW VOTERS A TOP FUNDERS THE BALLOT MEASURE INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURE ADS. IN THE PAST GENERALITAT DITION DISPOSED ACTIVE P. FORTY SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO SHOW VOTERS TOP UNDER CIRCULATING AND MISTER PREFERENCE. AND. RECALL PETITIONS. THE BILL TO WORK REALLY WELL WE TAKE A- AND WE ALL SEEN THE SCHOOL. COULD THE TOP. ON TV- RADIO AT THAT CETERA UP BUT AS SOON AROUND DESCRIBED WE HAVE SEEN A MAJOR ABUSES UP THEIR INTENT TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR VOTERS TO SEE THE POP UNDERS ON ON TV ESPECIALLY. ON ONLINE IMAGE ADS WHERE THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SHO TOP UNDER RIGHT NOW AT AT. ALL UNLIKE EVERY OTHER COUNTRY OUT. IN LOCAL LEGISLATIVE RACES BUT THAT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR WILL PULL THEM BY MISTER SIGNATURE GATHERERS- I'M SO HAPPY TO FIFTY TWO IT UP THE ADDRESS OF THESE ABUSES WE SEEN THE LAST FOUR YEARS WE THINK A VERY REASONABLE FASHION- WE ALSO WORK WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES THE AUTHOR OF THE TEXT MESSAGE DISCOTEK FROM LAST. SESSION TO COME UP WITH A TO BE CLEAN UP CLARIFICATION. TO MAKE THAT THE WORDING MORE NATURALISTIC- WE BELIEVE THESE THESE COMMONSENSE CHANGES SHOULD ADDRESS ALL THE PIECES THAT WE'VE BEN SEEING. SO PEOPLE CAN ALWAYS CLEARLY THINK THE TOP FUNDERS OF ABOUT MEASURING HOW E. F. AS INTENDED- AND HOPEFULLY THIS BILL PASSED THE WE WON'T BE TO MAKE. ANY FOR MANY CHANGES TO THE SCHOOLS ARE SCHOOLS FOR AWHILE THOUGH I'M SURE. PEOPLE FIND CLEVER WAYS EVENTUALLY ARE AROUND EVEN THE IS BUT PEOPLE EXPECT ME TO LUNCH RIGHT NOW. THANKS AGAIN AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR ABOUT. THANK YOU MISTER LANG AND EXCEPT WE HAVE MISTER POWERS. OF THE CALIFORNIA BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU MISTER TERM MEMBER. THIS IS MARK POWERS IN THE- BUT- RESEARCH. WE THE RADIO TV. SERVING YOUR TO. ARE HOW WE WORK MANY YEARS WOULD TRENTON THE CLEAN MONEY ORGANIZATION TO ENSURE THE POLITICAL AD DISCLOSURES ACROSS MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE. PERSONAL CARE BUT THE DISCLOSURE ITSELF DOES NOT PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR ONE MEDIUM OVER ANOTHER SECONDLY CONSISTENT. WITH VOTERS CAN EXPECT TO SEE THE SAME INFORMATION ACROSS ALL MEDIA PLATFORMS. SO WE SUPPORT THE IDEA IN THIS BILL TO LOWER THE THRESHOLD FOR TOP FUNDERS FOR LOCAL RACES.

THAT MAKE POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS THESE L. C.'S HAVE LIMITED EXISTING PUBLIC DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT AND OTHER EXISTING LAWS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN A FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION ENFORCEMENT DIVISION EXAMINATION OF LLCS FOUND THAT. IT WAS RELATIVELY EASY TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT AN L. L. C.'S. TYPE OF BUSINESS IT'S ADDRESS. ITS AGING FOR SERVICES A PROCESS. HOWEVER IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND MANY TIMES IMPOSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY IN L. L. C.'S OWNER. OR THE TRUE SOURCE OF FUNDS. OF AN LLC'S POLITICAL EXPENDITURE. SB SIX EIGHT SIX SIX TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION L. L. C. THAT MAKE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS SPECIFICALLY SIX EIGHT SIX REQUIRES LLC'S TO SUBMIT TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE UPON QUALIFYING AS A COMMITTEE A LIST OF MEMBERS WHO EITHER HAVE A MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN THE LLC OF AT LEAST TEN PERCENT.

OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS FIFTY FIFTY HAVE FOUND INCREASING INSTANCES OF THESE BEING USED. TO USUALLY NO WAY FOR THE PUBLIC TO IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUALS BEHIND THE CONTRIBUTION. GOAL BUT STILL PROTECT THE DARK MONEY PROBLEM BY SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE TRUE SOURCE OF THESE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE REQUIRING DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE L. L. C. OR OTHER WORDS DISCLOSURE OF WHO HAS FUNDED THE L. B. THE FIRST CLOSURE WOULD BE REQUIRED ONLY IF THE L. L. C. REACHES A THRESHOLD LEVEL OF POLITICAL ACTIVITIES THAT WERE ALREADY UNDER CURRENT LAW. SUBJECT THE L. L. C. TO REGULATION UNDER THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT AT THE COMMITTEE OR COMMITTEE FONT THERE. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF NOT EVERY MEMBER OF THE L. I'LL SEE THAT RATHER ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE A 10% OR GREATER MEMBERSHIP INTEREST OR HAVE REACHED A THRESHOLD LEVEL OF NIELSEN CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE L. L. C. WITHIN A CERTAIN PERIOD. THE BILL HAS RECENTLY AMENDED TO REVISE THE THRESHOLDS AND THE COMMISSION HAS NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO FORMALLY WEIGH IN ON THE AMENDMENT.
