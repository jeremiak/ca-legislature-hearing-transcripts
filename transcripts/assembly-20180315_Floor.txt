DOWN SYNDROME AFFECTS ABOUT ONE OF EVERY SEVEN HUNDRED BIRTHS NEARLY SIX THOUSAND BABIES EACH YEAR. DOWN SYNDROME OCCURS WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL HAS A FULL OR PARTIAL EXTRA COPY OF CHROMOSOME TWENTY ONE. THIS ADDITIONAL GENETIC MATERIAL ALTERS THE COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT AND CAUSES THE CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH DOWN SYNDROME. DOWN SYNDROME INCREASES THE RISK FOR CERTAIN MEDICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE ARE DEFECTS RESPIRATORY AND HEARING PROBLEMS. AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE HOWEVER SINCE MANY OF THESE CONDITIONS ARE TREATABLE THEY DO NOT GREATLY DIMINISH THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DOWN SYNDROME. PEOPLE WITH DOWN SYNDROME ALSO EXPERIENCE COGNITIVE DELAYS BUT THE EFFECTS ARE USUALLY MILD TO MODERATE AND ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF THE MANY STRENGTHS AND TALENTS THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL POSSESSES. FOR INSTANCE MANY INDIVIDUALS WITH DOWN SYNDROME HAVE OVERCOME NUMEROUS OBSTACLES TO ACHIEVE GREATNESS SUCH AS FASHION DESIGNERS PUBLIC SERVANTS AND ATHLETES INCLUDING KIM CHANDLER WHO DESPITE MANY. BEING UNABLE TO EXECUTE SIMPLE MUSCLE MANEUVERS AS A CHILD BECAME A FOUR TIME NATIONAL CHAMPION AT THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS. ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND HEALTHCARE AND A STIMULATING HOME ENVIRONMENT AND A POSITIVE SUPPORT FROM FAMILY FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY IN ABLE THOSE WITH DOWN SYNDROME TO LEAD FULFILLING AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES. THIS PRODUCTIVITY INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO ATTENDING SCHOOL WORKING VOTING ADVOCATING FOR THE WELL BEING OF THEIR COMMUNITIES AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE SOCIETY IN MANY MANY WONDERFUL WAYS. THIS RESOLUTION WILL BRING MUCH NEEDED A PUBLIC AWARENESS TO DOWN SYNDROME BY ENCOURAGING THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES AND ADVOCACY TO SUPPORT THE DOWN SYNDROME COMMUNITY.

WELL GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY INDIVIDUALS WITH DOWN SYNDROME CAN BRING SO MUCH TO OUR COMMUNITY IN OUR WORKFORCE.

THEIR OBJECTIVE HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO BUILD GIRLS OF COURAGE CONFIDENCE AND CHARACTER WHO MAKE A BETTER WORLD FOR EVERYONE AND THEY DO THAT BY CREATING A. WONDERFUL SISTERHOOD OF COURAGEOUS AND CONFIDENT WOMEN THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND THE WORLD. GIRLS THROUGH THE GIRL SCOUTS OF AMERICA LEARNED THAT THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THEIR SUCCESS OR WHAT THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH. AND I THINK MANY OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT CERTAINLY IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS IF YOU'VE BEEN EATING ANY GIRL SCOUT COOKIES. WEED FORMER TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GIRL SCOUT COOKIES IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER JUST HOW EXTENSIVE AND BROUGHT THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN. SINCE THAT FIRST MEETING IN SAVANNAH GEORGIA MORE THAN FIFTY NINE MILLION GIRLS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE GIRL SCOUT MOVEMENT DURING THEIR CHILDHOOD. AND THAT NUMBER CONTINUES TO GROW AS THE GIRL SCOUT OF THE MET AMERICA CONTINUES TO INSPIRE AND INVITE NEW MEMBERS. THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION GIRL SCOUTS ONE POINT NINE GIRL MEMBERS AND EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ADULT MEMBERS WHO. ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WORK AS VOLUNTEERS AT CAMPS THROUGH THEIR GIRL SCOUT TROOPS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THROUGH MEMBERSHIP IN THE WORLD ASSOCIATION OF GIRL SCOUT GUIDES WHICH I ENCOURAGE YOU TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT AND GIRL SCOUTS OF AMERICA IS PART OF A WORLDWIDE FAMILY OF TEN MILLION GIRLS AND WOMEN IN THE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX COUNTRIES. SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WOMEN CURRENTLY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT.
