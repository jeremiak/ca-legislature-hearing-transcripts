00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:43.215
WILLIAMS.

00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:45.051
WERE TWO DEFENDANTS IN THIS CASE --

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:46.652
I'LL START BY FIRST ADDRESSING

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:48.154
SOME OF THE THE THINGS THAT WERE

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.256
RAISED IN THE SUPPORT TESTIMONY

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:51.624
STIPULATED.

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:53.125
MY CLIENTS LOST THIS CASE THEY

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:55.227
ARE GOING TO PAY MONEY INTO A

00:09:55.294 --> 00:09:57.363
FUND THE CLEANUP HOMES.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.565
WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IS WHAT

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:00.733
HAPPENS AFTER THAT?

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.701
YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA HAVE

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:03.536
FIRST DOLLAR IN.

00:10:03.602 --> 00:10:05.504
THERE WAS REFERENCE TO TWO LINES

00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:07.106
IN THE APPELLATE COURT DECISION

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:08.808
AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THOSE

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:11.210
TWO LINES HAVE MORE MEANING THAN --

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.179
THAN THESE FOLKS WOULD SUGGEST

00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:15.348
BUT BEYOND THAT I THINK WE LOOK

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:17.450
AT CALIFORNIA STATE POLICY

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:19.719
TRADITIONAL TORT LAW.

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:21.387
THIS IS AN ACT IN EQUITY.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.990
AND IN EQUITY IN THOSE ACTS THE

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:26.158
RIGHT OF CONTRIBUTION FOR OTHERS

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:29.495
WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE HARM

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:31.030
IS A NATURAL.

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:33.332
IT IS PART OF THE ABILITY TO GO

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:34.767
AND RECOVER TO CLEAN UP THAT

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:36.302
HARM.

00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:37.870
THAT IS TRADITIONAL STE

00:10:37.937 --> 00:10:40.473
CALIFORNIA STATE POLICY IS WE

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:42.241
SAY ANYBODY WHO MIGHT BE

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:43.576
RESPONSIBLE WE'RE GONNA BRING

00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:45.378
YOU ALL AND WE'RE GONNA GET THE

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:46.946
THING CLEANED UP AND THEN YOU

00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:48.647
FIGHT AMONGST YOURSELVES AS TO

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:50.182
WHO PAYS FOR WHAT AND FOR HOW

00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:51.050
MUCH.

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:52.885
ARE VALUE HERE IS GETTING THINGS

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:54.887
CLEANED UP.

00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:56.422
WE LOST THE CASE WE ARE GOING TO

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.524
PUT FIRST DOLLAR INTO THIS FUND

00:10:58.591 --> 00:10:59.859
TO CLEAN UP HOMES.

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:01.894
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT TAKES

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:04.597
AWAY THE ABILITY FOR US TO GO

00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:06.732
AFTER FOLKS WHO HAVE NOT

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:08.434
FOLLOWED THE LAW?

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.036
AND THAT'S SLUMLORDS.

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:12.071
WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN SUING

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:14.006

00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:19.879
LAW ARE NOT.

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:22.048

FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.885

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:27.319

THAT TO BE PARTICIPATING IN ANY

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:23.395
PART OF THE PROGRAM.

00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:24.630
IS THAT SEEM [inaudible]

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.532
ADEQUATE.

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:28.601
SO IF I'M A PROPERTY OWNER AND I

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:29.768

SOME CONCERNS AND I JUST TAKE MY

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:33.439
SWEET TIME.

IN GOING THROUGH AN ABATEMENT A

REMEDIATION PROGRAM BUT I AM

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:39.445

THAT I AM MAKING EFFORTS.

00:14:42.815 --> 00:14:43.382
DOES THAT SEEM LIKE IT GOES FAR

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:44.750
ENOUGH.

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:45.284
SO WE COULD SAY THAT THE

00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:46.585
IMMUNITY THAT WERE ESTABLISHING

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:48.187
WITH THIS BILL IS VERY NARROW IT

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:49.955
IS ONLY LIMITED TO LAWSUITS

00:14:50.022 --> 00:14:51.056
AGAINST OWNERS AND PUBLIC

00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:52.324
ENTITIES THAT ARE SEEKING TO

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:53.759
RECOVER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:54.827
THE ABATEMENT PROGRAMS.

00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:56.061
BUT THEY'RE STILL EXPOSED TO

00:14:56.128 --> 00:14:58.163
OTHER POTENTIAL LIABILITY AND SO

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.064
I WOULD.

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:00.566
I I I I DO UNDERSTAND THE

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:02.101
OPPOSITION'S TRYING TO SUGGEST

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:04.069
THAT SOMEHOW LEAVE THINGS OPEN

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:05.504
TO SLAM ARTS AND AND LET ME JUST

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:06.071
SAY.

00:15:06.138 --> 00:15:07.873
I FOR ONE I DON'T THINK THERE'S

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.475
ANYONE WORKING ON THIS BILL.

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:11.110
THAT WOULD WANT TO DEFEND THE

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:12.745
ABILITY OF SOME WORDS TO RECEIVE

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:14.780
ANY MORE PROTECTION.

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:15.347
THAN THEY SHOULD.

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:16.915
ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THERE IS A

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:19.285
POT OF MONEY AND WE WANT TO HAVE

00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:20.352
MAKE PEOPLE.

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:21.253
MAKE THIS PART OF MONEY

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.755
AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC WE DON'T%

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:24.423
WANT TO SCARE OFF POTENTIAL

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:25.357
INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE WHAT THE

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:26.725
PAIN COMPANIES ARE SAYING IS

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:28.294
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BRING.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.297
LAWSUITS AGAINST HOMEOWNERS THAT

00:15:31.363 --> 00:15:33.399
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AND THE

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:34.366
REASON WE PUT IN THE LANGUAGE

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:35.267
THAT.

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:36.368
THE CHAIR ONE IN THIS COMMITTEE

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:37.970
HAD PUT FORTH IS TO MAKE IT

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:40.005
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THE

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:41.073
SLUMLORDS A MISTER MOFFETT IS

REMEDIES -- WE WANNA MAKE

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:57.356
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT THE VERY

00:15:57.423 --> 00:15:59.358
LIMITED IMMUNITY IS REALLY TO

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:00.759
PROTECT INDIVIDUALS THAT WANT TO

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:02.461
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:03.829
PARTICULAR PROGRAM BECAUSE IF WE%

FORMER MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.067
TO SIT THERE NO ONE IS GOING TO

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.735
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND THEN

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:10.536
ALL THIS AND WE'RE GONNA BE BACK

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:11.837
TO WHERE WE STARTED.

00:16:11.904 --> 00:16:13.105
ME COULD GO AHEAD AND IF -- I'M

TRYING TO REFINE TO MAKE CERTAIN

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:15.908

00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:17.343
OF I'M SUPPORTIVE I'M JUST

00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:18.677

PARTICIPATES IN THIS PROGRAM.

00:16:27.619 --> 00:16:28.854
SURE WHEN WILLIAMS BY EXAMPLE

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:31.023
TRIES TO COME AFTER THEM.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.825

THEY'RE PROTECTED BUT THEY DON'T

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:40.499

DE.

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:46.472
EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY IS THAT-CORRECT SO IF I COULD JUST AND

00:16:46.538 --> 00:16:48.407

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:00.819
WE'RE NOT SAYING OTHER THINGS

IS SHERMAN WILLIAMS WOULD WANT

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:08.660
TO SEE THAT HOMEOWNER BECAUSE

00:17:08.727 --> 00:17:10.129
THE HOME OWNER RECEIVED SOME

00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:11.964

MILLION DOLLAR POT.

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:28.781
IF A HOMEOWNER JUST SIGNED UP

00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:29.314
FOR THE PROGRAM AND NEVER

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:29.581

RECEIVED A TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:32.885

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.153
NO GROUNDS FOR THE SUIT BECAUSE

00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:36.722
THERE WOULD BE NO FUNDS FOR SURE

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:38.624
WILLIAMS TO SEE TO GET BACK.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.124

THE PROPERTY OWNER.

00:17:44.763 --> 00:17:47.266
ODD THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT

00:17:47.332 --> 00:17:49.368
PROPERTY -- SHARON WILLIAMS

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:51.470
TRIES TO SUE NOT FOR THE

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:52.738
COLLECTION OF THE DOLLARS

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:54.339
ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABATEMENT

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:56.308
BUT SOME SORT OF PERCENTILE

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:58.310
OBLIGATION AND RESPONSIBILITY

00:17:58.377 --> 00:17:59.344
THAT THEY HAVE.

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.546
ARE YOU SAYING THIS PROTECTS

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:01.780
SUMMER DOESN'T PROTECT.

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:03.882
THAT CIRCUMSTANCES NOT ADDRESSED

00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:04.750
BY THE BILL THAT'S LIKE A

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:06.485
TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSONAL

00:18:06.552 --> 00:18:08.587
INJURY LAWSUIT THAT HAS NOTHING

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:10.589
TO DO WITH WHO PAID INTO THIS

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:12.024
FUND OR GOT MONEY OUT OF THIS

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.358
FUND BUT NOT IS THAT THEY WOULD

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:14.493
NOT BE PROTECTED IN THAT

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.494
SITUATION I THINK THAT.

00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:17.496
THE LANGUAGE WE PUT IN THEIR

00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:19.164
CLARIFY SAID SO ALL THAT THIS

00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:20.632
BILL DOES IS IT REFERS TO IF

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:22.935
PEOPLE DO ACTUALLY ACCESS MONEY

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:24.770
FROM THIS FUND FOR ABATEMENT

00:18:24.837 --> 00:18:25.904
PURPOSES.

00:18:25.971 --> 00:18:27.706
THAT MONEY COMES OUT OF THE SURE

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.174
WHEN WILLIAMS OR WHOEVER THAT

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:30.676
THE DEFENDANTS ARE WHAT TO PUT

00:18:30.742 --> 00:18:33.212
THE MONEY AND THEY HAVE TO THEY

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:34.012
WILL.

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:36.482
BE REQUIRED TO PAY THAT MONEY

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:37.916
AND THEY THEN CANNOT TURN AROUND

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:41.386
ANDSUE TO GET THE MONEY BACK.

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:44.556
HAVING FOR THAT PURPOSE.

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:47.826
ALL RIGHT NEXT -- THE REBEL

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:50.562
POSES -- TO TO THE OPPOSITION --

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:53.565
SOMETIMES WHEN INDIVIDUALS--

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:55.834
ARE ARE SUED THEY JUST PICKED

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:56.869
THE RIGHT PLACE FOR IT AND SAID

00:18:56.935 --> 00:18:58.570
LOOK SOUNDS AS IF YOUR CLIENTS

00:18:58.637 --> 00:18:59.905
WERE THE RIGHT THIS FRUIT

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:03.609
CONAGRA AND SHERMAN WILLIAMS --

00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:05.043
THOSE ARE THE TWO ENTITIES

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.045
DEEMED RESPONSIBLE FOR AN

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:09.915
INDUSTRY WIDE PROBLEM.

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.450
THE SITUATION THAT YOU'RE

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:12.518
CONFRONTING.

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:14.953
ES BEARING ALL THIS WEIGHT.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.656
IS HOW EXACTLY YOU GO OUT.

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:19.892
AND TRY TO DRAW FOLKS INTO A

00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:21.260
DRAGNET TO SHARE ON THAT

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:23.195
RESPONSIBILITY THOSE SUCCESSOR

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:25.631
ENTITIES THAT HAD PREDECESSORS

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:26.765
WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE LEAD

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:28.534
PAINT INDUSTRY.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.202
WAY BACK IN TIME IS THAT IF.

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:31.870
A FAIR ASSESSMENT OF WHERE

00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:33.906
YOU'RE AT I WOULD SAY THAT THE

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:36.742
ISSUE THAT WE FACE IN THIS BILL.

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:38.710
IS THAT YOU KNOW AND AND TO SOME

00:19:38.777 --> 00:19:40.712
EXTENT ALL AGREE WITH WITH THE

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:41.580

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:43.382
YOU KNOW WHO THE STATEMENTS THAT

00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:44.650
WERE JUST MADE.

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:47.019
WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN IN SUING

00:19:47.085 --> 00:19:49.721
HOMEOWNERS LIVING IN THEIR HOMES

00:19:49.788 --> 00:19:51.490
WHO HAVE FOLLOWED THE LAW.

00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:53.258
THERE'S THERE'S NO LAWSUIT THERE

00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:55.360
THERE'S NO CONTRIBUTION ACTION

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:56.962
THERE AND IF THE BILL WAS

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.897
LIMITED JUST TO THAT.

00:19:58.964 --> 00:19:59.498
I DON'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE AN

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:00.666
ISSUE.

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:02.634
BUT WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY DOES

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:06.471
IS IT SAYS A SLUM LORD WHO HAS

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:07.973
THUMB THEIR NOSE AT THE LAW.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.342
DID CONTRIBUTE TO THE HARM.

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:12.544
IS ABSOLVED FROM ANY FINANCIAL

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:14.112
LIABILITY FOR DOING SOMETHING

00:20:14.179 --> 00:20:15.614
THAT CURRENT LAW WOULD REQUIRE

00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:16.915
THEM TO DATE AND THAT IS WHAT

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:18.317
THE LAW SAYS SO WE'RE GOING TO

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:19.518
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON I THINK

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:21.086
WE'VE ESTABLISHED WHAT THE LAW

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:22.054
DEALS WITH.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.221
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO BACK AND

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:24.823
RE LITIGATE THE CASE YOU FOLKS

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.725
LOST THE CASE WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:28.260
ABOUT NOW IS THAT FUND THAT IS

00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:30.262
AVAILABLE AND IT'S AVAILABLE FOR

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:33.231
A VERY LIMITED SPECIFIC PURPOSE

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:35.667
IT'S AVAILABLE ONLY TO THOSE WHO

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.303
ACCESS THE FUN. TO DO ABATEMENT

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.238
IF THEY ONLY ACCESS TO TO THE

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:41.773
TUNE OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.874
WHEN IT'S A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR

00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:44.009
CLEANUP.

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:47.646
THEY ARE ENTITLED TO THE TWO

00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:48.914
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE THANK

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:49.915
COMPANIES CANNOT THREATEN TO SUE

00:20:49.982 --> 00:20:51.683
THEM EITHER FOR THAT MONEY OR

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.352
FOR ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY SO I

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:55.087
THINK THAT THAT IS WHERE WE'RE

00:20:55.153 --> 00:20:55.887
AT WE'RE NOT GOING TO RE

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:57.923
LITIGATE THE OTHER SHORE ONLY GO

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.725
TO ADDRESS THE BILL AT HAND.

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:02.194
AND FOR THE THIRD TIME THAT

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.795
AMENDMENT THAT THE ASSEMBLY

00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:05.364
MEMBER TOOK I THINK CLARIFIES

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.466
THE LIMITATIONS AND THE LIMITED

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:08.533
SCOPE.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.035
OF THIS BILLS WILL GO ON TO

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:11.536
MISTER STIR.

00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:14.940
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:16.008
THANKS FOR CONTINUOUS LOG WITH

00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:18.343
THIS ISSUE -- WE WERE IN AND

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.013
SORT OF STATE OF UNCERTAINTY OF

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:23.682
THE END OF LAST SESSION AND I

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:24.516
WANTED ON THE ONE HAND I'M I'M

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:27.819
GLAD THE LITIGATION WORKED OUT-THE WAY IT DID BECAUSE WE DO

00:21:27.886 --> 00:21:29.554
HAVE SOME CERTAINTY NOW AND

00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:30.922
EVERYONE WAS SCARED FRANKLY

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:32.991
INVENTOR COUNTY IN LA IN BACK.

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:35.160
HOME AND I DO I RESENT THE

00:21:35.227 --> 00:21:37.229
THREATS THAT WERE.

00:21:37.295 --> 00:21:39.398
LEVIED AT THE END OF SESSION.

00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:40.866
MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT FOR

00:21:40.932 --> 00:21:42.601
UNDER MILLIONS OUT ENOUGH.

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:43.235
UNDER THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM

00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:45.303
IS BIGGER AND I KNOW THAT THAT

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.938
SORT OF THE NATURE OF LITIGATION

00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:48.807
AND SETTLEMENTS.

00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:50.375
I'M WONDERING I'M MUCH LESS

00:21:50.442 --> 00:21:52.411
INTERESTED WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

00:21:52.477 --> 00:21:53.845
TO THE OPPOSITION MUCH LESS

00:21:53.912 --> 00:21:56.181
INTERESTED IN.

00:21:56.248 --> 00:21:57.983
A MECHANISM FOR REIMBURSING

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.419
THEIR LIABILITY THAT THAT'S A

00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:03.622
THAT'S A NON STARTER BUT BUT THE

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:05.023
THE IDEA THAT.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.325
THERE COULD BE OTHERS LIABLE OUT

00:22:07.392 --> 00:22:09.828
THERE -- AND THAT THAT COULD

00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:10.962
ACTUALLY SUPPLEMENT THE FUND

00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:12.297
HAVE YOU HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY

00:22:12.364 --> 00:22:13.331
THOUGHT TO THAT I KNOW I JUST.

00:22:13.398 --> 00:22:15.467
I WE WERE POKING AROUND BEFORE

00:22:15.534 --> 00:22:16.635
THE HEARING IN JUST.

00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:18.470
BRAINSTORMING LIKE [inaudible]

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:21.673
THE THE THE AMENDMENT DE THAT

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.843
THE COMMITTEE ADDED THAT ALLOWS

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.511
FOR TENANTS LEGAL REMEDIES FOR

00:22:26.578 --> 00:22:28.080
ADDRESSING PRESENCE OF OF LEAD

00:22:28.146 --> 00:22:28.814
PAINT.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.648
BUT IF THERE WERE SOME OTHER

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:30.982
MECHANISM BEYOND JUST THE

00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:35.020
TENANTS SEEKING THAT RECOURSE.

00:22:35.087 --> 00:22:36.621
AND TRYING TO GET BACK TO GO

00:22:36.688 --> 00:22:38.790
INTO EITHER A LOCAL JURISDICTION

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:40.792
OR THE FUND OVER ALL -- FROM

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:42.961
SORT OF ADDITIONAL BAD ACTORS

00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:43.595
OUT THERE IS THAT SOMETHING YOU

00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:46.431
GUYS OF THOUGHT ABOUT IT ALL IS

00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:47.799
THERE SOME WAY.

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:49.634
TO GO FURTHER IN OTHER WORDS NOT

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:51.136
JUST LIMIT IS THE FOUR HUNDRED

00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:54.206
BUT THEN SAY -- AS A UP A

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:55.373
PROPERTY OWNER WHO IS NOT TAKING

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.109
CARE OF WHAT THEY NEED TO TAKE

00:22:57.175 --> 00:23:00.479
CARE OF IF THEY WOULD BE LIABLE

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:02.114
FOR THOSE EXPENSES AND THEN THAT

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.148
WOULD THEN SUPPLEMENT.

00:23:03.215 --> 00:23:04.883
WHAT THE BOOK?

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:06.451
WE BE ARTICULATING HERE AS WELL

00:23:06.518 --> 00:23:08.453
AS IN THE LITIGATION.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.488
YOU GUYS THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IDEA

00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:10.989
I THINK I ANSWER THE QUESTION --

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:12.724
IN THE FLY AWAY WHICH IS YOU AND

00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:13.925
I AND CENTER HERTZBERG AND OTHER

00:23:13.992 --> 00:23:15.127
COLLEAGUES OF MINE THE ASSEMBLY

00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:16.528
WE SPENT SOME TIME LAST YEAR

00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:18.830
TRYING TO MEDIATE BETWEEN.

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:20.398
THE TWO SIDES OF THIS ISSUE AND

00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:22.033
I THINK.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.568
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE COULD

00:23:23.635 --> 00:23:27.339
BROADEN THE POT INVOLVE MORE --

00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:29.674
MORE INDIVIDUALS IN THIS -- HELP

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:30.909
MORE INDIVIDUALS AND THEN THE

00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:32.077
JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE

00:23:32.144 --> 00:23:33.645
REPRESENTED BY THE PLAINTIFFS IS

00:23:33.712 --> 00:23:35.380
SOMETHING I THINK WE WOULD ALL

00:23:35.447 --> 00:23:36.148
WANT.

00:23:36.214 --> 00:23:37.249
GIVEN THE CHALLENGES OF

00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:39.584
LITIGATION -- THAT HAVE LASTED

00:23:39.651 --> 00:23:40.852
FOR TWENTY YEARS AS A LEAD PAINT

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:43.522
COMPANIES WERE FIGHTING THIS OFF --

00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:45.624
WE WERE UNABLE TO GET TO A PLACE

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.626
I FOR ONE WOULD BE OPEN TO

00:23:47.692 --> 00:23:48.193
THINKING IF THERE WAS UP A

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.228
BROADER OPPORTUNITY BUT I THINK

00:23:50.295 --> 00:23:51.496
THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION

00:23:51.563 --> 00:23:52.631
WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US WITH THE

00:23:52.697 --> 00:23:53.365
BILL.

00:23:53.431 --> 00:23:53.832
THE QUESTION WE HAVE

00:23:53.899 --> 00:23:55.300
INFORMACIóN THE BILL IT IS IT

00:23:55.367 --> 00:23:56.334
IS LIKELY IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF

00:23:56.401 --> 00:23:57.502
MONTHS THERE WILL BE A COURT

00:23:57.569 --> 00:23:58.937
SETTLEMENT AND THE CLOCK WILL

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:00.405
START TAKING THERE WILL BE FOR

00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:02.841
YEARS. TO SPECIFIC FOR FOR FOR

00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:04.242
HOMEOWNERS TO AVAIL THEMSELVES

00:24:04.309 --> 00:24:05.644
OF A LEAD PAINT ABATEMENT FUND

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.611
AND IF THEY DON'T DO THAT THAT

00:24:06.678 --> 00:24:08.446
MONEY WILL REVERT BACK TO THE

00:24:08.513 --> 00:24:09.614
COMPANIES.

00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:11.616
THAT FOR DECADES KNOWINGLY

00:24:11.683 --> 00:24:14.386
PROFITED OFF A POISONING KITS

00:24:14.452 --> 00:24:16.755
AND IN THAT INSTANCE WE WANT TO

00:24:16.822 --> 00:24:20.492
ENSURE.

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:21.459
THAT HOMEOWNERS.

00:24:21.526 --> 00:24:22.127
BELIEVE THEY'RE NOT ABOUT TO GET

00:24:22.194 --> 00:24:24.196
SUED BY THE COMPANIES THAT ARE

00:24:24.262 --> 00:24:25.230
REPRESENTED BY THE OPPOSITION

00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:27.199
TODAY BUT TO YOUR POINT IF WE

00:24:27.265 --> 00:24:27.933
COULD HAVE A BROADER

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:28.633
CONVERSATION I WILL SUITABLE

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.601
SITES I'M OPEN IN THAT

00:24:29.668 --> 00:24:30.602
CONVERSATION WE GET THERE BUT

00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:31.703
THAT ISN'T THE BILL AND I

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.338
APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN I

00:24:33.405 --> 00:24:33.638
APPRECIATE.

00:24:33.705 --> 00:24:35.574
THE DISCUSSION THAT THE BILL

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.311
BEFORE US IS ON A VERY LIMITED.

00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:41.012
SET OF FACTS AND OF THE

00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:43.582
RESOLUTION THAT WE ANTICIPATE --

00:24:43.648 --> 00:24:45.050
OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS SO MY

00:24:45.116 --> 00:24:46.618
ONLY POINT MADAM CHAIR WAS THAT

00:24:46.685 --> 00:24:49.054
THE THE THE LIMITATION ON

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.455
LIABILITY MAY KEEP.

00:24:50.522 --> 00:24:53.258
POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS -- OFF

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:54.326
THE TABLE THAT WE COULD

00:24:54.392 --> 00:24:56.428
OTHERWISE BE ADDING TO THIS FOUR

00:24:56.494 --> 00:24:57.529
HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S THAT'S

00:24:57.596 --> 00:24:59.231
THAT'S THE CONCERN SO SO WITHIN

00:24:59.297 --> 00:25:00.932
THE NARROW SCOPE OF THE BILL.

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:02.801
I GET WE DON'T WANT.

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:04.669
OPEN ANY LITIGATION PREDATORY

00:25:04.736 --> 00:25:07.205
LITIGATION WAYS TO KEEP PEOPLE

00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:09.307
OUT OF THE PROGRAM BUT IF IF WE

00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:10.942
WERE ABLE TO GO.

00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:12.611
AND FIND OTHER BAD ACTORS AND

00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:14.980
AND AND SORT OF KEEP THEM WITHIN

00:25:15.046 --> 00:25:16.448
THE SCOPE OF DE THAT YOU ADDED.

00:25:16.514 --> 00:25:17.549
AND MAKE SURE THOSE LEGAL

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:18.917
REMEDIES COULD STILL CONTRIBUTE

00:25:18.984 --> 00:25:20.752
A BROADER FIND ANYWAY I CAN BE A

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:22.888
CONTINUED CONVERSATION  THANK

00:25:22.954 --> 00:25:23.488
YOU FOR THAT INDULGENCE

00:25:23.555 --> 00:25:23.889
CERTAINLY.

00:25:23.955 --> 00:25:27.859
ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

00:25:27.926 --> 00:25:29.227
ALL RIGHT -- CAN WE TAKE THAT AS

00:25:29.294 --> 00:25:30.228
YOUR CLOTHES OR WOULD YOU LIKE

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:31.196
TO FOLLOW UP THINK YOU'VE MADE

00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:32.931
YOUR POINT BUT FEEL FREE I'D I'D

00:25:32.998 --> 00:25:34.032
I THINK I'VE MADE A POINT A VERY

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:35.667
MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S

00:25:35.734 --> 00:25:36.534
CONSIDERATION OF THIS THIS HAS

00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:37.502
BEEN.

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:38.603
A LONG STANDING ISSUE AND AGAIN

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:40.138
AS WE SAID BEFORE WE'RE TRYING

00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:42.340
TO JUST INSURE A VERY NARROW CAR

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:44.175
ABOUT UP FROM UNITY FOR

00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:45.710
HOMEOWNERS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:25:45.777 --> 00:25:47.646
OF THIS SO THAT THEY DON'T --

00:25:47.712 --> 00:25:48.947
BEAR THE RISK OF POTENTIALLY

00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:50.882
BEING SUED ONE LAWSUIT AGAINST

00:25:50.949 --> 00:25:52.884
ONE HOMEOWNER COULD HAVE

00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:54.519
ENORMOUS REPERCUSSIONS OF THE
