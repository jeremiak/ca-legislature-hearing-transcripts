it working yeah it is working. Anybody hear me in the back near me the back. Hello okay closer why. That is great that's right speech written by my staff you'll I can't read it. Well welcome everybody to the this beautiful C. S. U. Dominguez hills campus what a great place to be for all you tore us out there thank you for. I mean if the dissipating and to our conversation is David. For those who may not know this hearing on student success is part of our- two year statewide tour of college campuses now I can hear that. Our Senate committee on student success this is a- we've been we've been engaged in a two year effort going to college campuses throughout our our wonderful state to explore student needs in their ability to succeed in the classroom. Out last year earlier this spring we visited Sacramento state today we're here at the mega sales tomorrow we're going to be a Cal Poly Pomona. And it's important that for those of us in in the lawmaking world that. We don't just to pass laws and hope that they get implemented but it's important that we get in on the ground. Experience and knowledge about what's happening here. At the mega cells in colleges around our state and that and that's why we're here. For me coming back to this campus is a little bit of deja vu I out loud I was last here forty years ago. Things have changed just a little bit. I was a student body president at San Diego state. And with that as a part of the California state student association we go to campuses everyone to. Collaborate with our fellow students and got the opportunity to come here to Dominguez hills back then it's fun to come back. Right now. And another thing of note is that up at least for me and I maybe from my colleagues as well. I was double book today. That's like how did that happen will. Last week governor Newsome's office called and said would you come to meet with the governor this morning in Sacramento and I said well I kind of have a conflict. Because we have this hearing. And he said that I'm gonna sign your bill. And what's the bill. Well together with my colleagues. We pass the largest education bond bill ever put forward in California out of the Senate and the assembly. The governor the governor this morning is signing it. And I think it has it has been signed provided provides over six billion dollars. For higher education facilities in California six billion dollars including two billion for the California state universities which to make a sales. Is eligible for a- but even with the governor's signature today it's not a done deal that will appear on the March ballot March primary ballot next year and I know this isn't a time to talk about politics but I hope you'll pay attention to what's on your ballot. Next year. So the mission of the select committee on student success is to gather experts together. For discussion not to push a specific agenda. But rather to learn best practices and innovations to improve student success. And our focus is on students and putting them on a path to graduation. And we're focus not just on what's happening in the classroom and the ability to get through university with a degree were also focusing. On hunger housing and mental health issues. We know that if students are able to take care of their basic needs that they're not gonna do well to stay in school. And certainly I am hoping that with our great panel of experts are going to hear from a few minutes that will learn more about. How that's happening here at Dominguez hills. I we have two campuses in the state the gist of. Talk about the positive models that we have out there. A Sacramento state in San Jose state where their participation for your grad program is extraordinary thousands of kids are in that commitment every year. And their graduate at their graduation rates are going up. In in a wonderful way and. The chancellor's office I know we're gonna hear from them in a few minutes with that Mr gold. At least they're report shows that here at the mega sells only about a hundred and twenty students are participating in that four year. Graduation pathway I have over thirteen thousand enrolled here and we want to understand that issue we'll hear from the chancellor's office to get us perspective. And then we'll get to digging down in the details here to make a sales. But I'm joined here by some wonderful colleagues in the legislature. I wanted to use them to give them a chance to make any kind of interest introductory remarks that they like to make. But on my left is senator Steve Bradford. Represents the magus hills is an alumni. Of this campus. Yeah that down we got a de. We'll see is a great Holly here in the Senate been a great advocate for a higher education institutions certainly Dominguez hills is that. De near and dear to his heart and I want to welcome him and invite him to make a remark she'd like to make. Thank you senator Glazer and let's give him a round of applause for putting the store on and. Making college chicks us a party and not just for the legislature but it should be for all of California to make sure that the young folks are for older adults who choose to. Attend a university whether to see if you use C. or private institution I have the means to succeed it's often. Assume simply because one might have a GPA might out with the scholarship or whatever it will cover all your- expenses for college and that's the farthest thing from the truth what we found I have found out in the last year have. I have five colleges in my district you counted community colleges you count. To make a sales and I Jeff next is a little bit I've Long Beach state. We have food pantries almost on all those campuses and it speaks volumes to the fact that there are. Young folks going coming to school on a daily basis home we're going home longer we also had a piece of legislation this year. Trying to allow students to sleep in their cars on campus because again we're dealing with the number. Of homeless students here in California. Then I decided about. The new housing that will be coming on cal state Dominguez hills in the coming years because it's vitally important for far too long this is pan team does a commuter. Campus and we want the students to have a real connection to the university and I think housing is part. Of that important role so I'm excited about the discussion today. And I would just be back in sept way on a piece of legislation that the governor of side. Last Monday my bill that I co authored with a- Nancy Skinner SP tools six. The fare paid to play out and it's got a whole lot of discussion about why should we- allow young folks who are in college to play sports to monetize your name like this an image. Much for the same reason we're talking have the discussion today just because you're a scholarship athlete. Doesn't mean you can cover all your expenses if in college. College expenses is more intuition and books we have found even though for scholarship athletes many of them go to bed hungry on a daily basis. Don't have spending money in their pocket so this is going to afford it so this is the nexus of dealing with. The high cost of college not only in California but across the nation so I'm excited about the discussion today. Look forty hearing from all wrecks Richard. Right thank you Steven red laces on that legislation that's a great accomplishment for. Our student athletes who I don't get the respect and attention that they deserve. Another colleague in the Senate. Is here senator Archuleta. You where did you go to college. Rihanna and Bob that was another great supporter of higher education this year in the legislature voted for the- higher education by it's great to have you here Bob anything you want to say to welcome. See if this works. This work there is. Yes in my thirty second Senate district we have Biola. College Wiener college riddles college and real Honda college and- so. And I'm looking at this list. Of colleges in the rates that the graduation rates and- and I just think of so many of. My family members that went to some of the schools. But I guess I'm I come as a parent as well. Because I have five children and they all obviously did well. At school I have one son out of as C. one daughter out of pepper dying one daughter out of Jeff minute two sons out of west point. So they were able to get there degrees in the four years and so on. But my concern is the focus is up on the student's ability. To understand that they can achieve the same thing for years. And my concern is are we getting the word out to the students. When we understand we have fourteen thousand students and rolled. We only have about two hundred in the program. It's something wrong here and we're not here to be punitive in any way shape or form but we want to be informed and we want to be informative as well. And you heard both my colleagues say that. The governor just signed a bill what money will be coming. So if money is going to be the issue Ben. It all that means that the future looks bright. That means that we're going to make these adjustments and I'm thinking that's what. I'm looking to hear and see that that cal state to make this is going to be part of the future. To open those dork bring these kids at. But as center Bradford had mentioned. We have kids that obviously or sleep in their cars and have a- not even have a good meal for the- entire day so these are issues were looked we've got to look at because we've got to keep them healthy and strong and- be able to participate. And then of course a lot of drop off because they have family issues they want to support a family we understand that. But if we can and Senate in Senate died them in such a way and I don't know what that and Senate will be. But we've got to come together with the plan an idea. That they can see the future right around the corner for years to come just like that and we want that success to be your success. So I'm here to listen to learn. And to participate anyway I can and I welcome the opportunity and certainly as a freshman senator. I am ready to participate anyway I can't thank you thank you Senate Archuleta and- to be successful in an lawmaking in Sacramento you have to have great partners in the in both houses not just the Senate. And my colleagues here but in the assembly and we have a great partner here. In a seven member al there's two G. thank you for you went to Berkeley I de Berkeley. But you've been a great champion of higher education and you have a lot of constituents that go to here to address fills and we're so happy that you've joined us here today so thank you very much. Sarah Glazer and good afternoon everyone my name is research and I have the privilege. Of along with center Bradford represented the South. Bay in the California State Legislature my district. Because from. A Gardena down through pals birdies. I I'm a former toward school board member and I know that a good number toward students I don't know. Anyone here from Torrance. Not today okay what time all right. I know a good number of my constituents attend cal state Dominguez hills and so thank you very much senator I. I sit on the assembly budget committee on education funding and so I've- heard. Many students testify about the challenges their students face today whether it's housing and security. Of food in security mental health challenges and so you know I'm- familiar with the challenges that that many of your students face today but I need to learn more. And so that's why I'm here thank you very much thank you thank you with family member well we have enough a formal welcome here to the campus by our provost. Michael's back now I want to invite him up and if he's coming up let me mention he's a former. Professor chair and dina cal state university Northridge or work for twenty five years his academic background is in special education. The master's and PhD in that field I see that you spent some time in my district. Chip college in Livermore working in the area of disabilities. Thank you for your service there and we know that you're involved in helping lead Dominguez hills. And their efforts in improving student success in ensuring access for the underserved and diverse communities that. That you serve your thank you for welcoming us your campus. Give so welcome to our campus see if we can get this microphone working as well. One two three. Good. Hello hello okay there we go so welcome on behalf of president Thomas parm or live in the university president he sends his regrets he couldn't join us today he's doing noble work back in Chicago Illinois so he's attending the Hispanic association of colleges and universities with ten of our student leaders a wonderful experience for them so he sends his regrets but his warm welcomes as well also I want to make sure that as I welcome our guests to the campus we are in a rare area of growth we'll talk talk about that in a couple minutes in my opening remarks. But I want to make sure that if you want to feel the love on campus as senator Glazer felt today because he had teddy coming give him a hug and they took a selfie as soon as he came into the student union we want to make sure you use the right hand signal when you're on campus so we don't want to do Longhorns hook them or matadors who wanted to the Toro so it's got to have the snout on it so if you're on campus showing students love makes you're doing this in the background you get a lot of love from our students in our community so welcome. As I said before this is an exciting time to be on our campus we are at an all time high in terms of our enrollment last year at this time we enrolled fifteen thousand seven hundred students as of census this year where it seventeen thousand twenty seven students on the campus of those students we have two thousand five hundred freshmen thirty three hundred transfer students and as you all know we have the most diverse school in the entire C. issue system. To give you some of the information here eighty two point 7% of our students and our freshman class are under represented minority students 73% Pell eligible 66% are first generation students at our universities this is critical about the needs of our students and I will tell you also that its key for us at cal state Dominguez hills because we are still for filling the C. issue mission which is about access and. Completion also you'll notice me take a torn our campus. That were in a rare place where we have new buildings that have been added to campus we have two academic buildings the first two academic buildings in twenty five years. On this campus. A science and innovation building. Which opens fall of twenty twenty just to our south here we have a brand new innovation and instruction building that will be opening in fall twenty one which will house our college of business administration public policy. And just as importantly we have new student housing that is slated to open in the spring twenty twenty one. Which is going to have an additional five hundred beds. Our president is fond of saying that in order for us to be successful with students on campus we need need to make sure they spend more time on campus. He has to find that as of waiting pinball interactions. It works with us with some of the students coming in the freshman class we have to describe what a pinball machine actually dot so we go through gyrations of showing how the ball works well works so forth. But I will tell you as you look at the campus and it is a significant day. Because assembly bill forty eight will wind up providing much needed infrastructure for our campus we have ninety million a hundred million dollars and need. To build up the infrastructure on campus. The other thing that I wanted to say is that we also have invested quite a bit in our personnel on campus we are hiring about thirty tenure track faculty per year. We are improving the culture of non tenure track faculty on the campus to provide a lot of our instruction. And we're also building a culture of staff also in support for them. We also aspire to in the president would say this if you were here we aspire to be a student ready university and if any of you have seen this a lot of the work that's coming out in the field. Is that instead of us talking about students being college prepared and career ready. We have to be. Student ready at our university and we think you'll find it to make a sells you hear from our panel of experts. We truly are embracing this notion of being student ready. That means making sure that we are not putting it on the shoulders of students we're talking about how we better performance university to support those students. The three areas that we have a mission to in the cal state system I've been. The system thirty year. We've always been about access in the LA based. Right now just so you know we are the only one out of five C. S. U. campus is still open in terms of access. With the only non impact the campus in the LA basin of what this means is. That that that students were placed balle the Mingus hills is their choice for quality C. S. U. education. So much so that we recently had a redirection policy in the state. Where three hundred in addition three hundred additional students came to our campus. As their choice when they could not have another option in the LA basin this is significant for us. We also develop really strong inner segmental partnerships so. You'll know that we place on an average three hundred tutors out in Compton unified in Gardena valley as well. And we put those those students out there. Their undergraduate students working with local K. through twelve classrooms. We also have mobile fab labs that were de donated by Toyota that we use to reach out to the committee for stem education. And we have strong partnerships with the committee colleges most notably El Camino college. Where we have a computer science collaboration. Only the second one in the state of California in the C. S. U. the other one being a moderate. The other thing we focus on is on completion and you'll hear a lot from the panel today about completion. Of certainly on the six metrics that we look at on five of those six were making good progress. On the six measure for your graduation will be talking about that. We are making progress moderates but progress to just make sure you have some level setting. In two thousand fourteen the four year graduation rate at this campus was five percent. This past year it's risen now up it sixteen percent. In about a year from now. So our aspirations or if you think about that over five short years. We've tripled wrong the mark to triple our four year graduation rates. Something that is the present with safe use here we can do better we must do better for students to be out there. The second issue for us the third issue for us actually is the only. With connected to. Completion is what we do to address student needs we are foremost among the C. issue campuses and providing something called affordable learning solutions and this is where we provide courses. At either low cost or no cost cost the students. We've been calculated of within the past year we have four hundred fifty faculty that participate in this program the leader in the C. issue. And we save students close to a million dollars in terms of money they would rather spend on course materials. I will channel the president for minute that's an applause line the million dollars. In terms of basic needs will talk about I did provide. A little graphic on the table there we will provide these in the back. Cal state Dominguez hills been a partnership with apple their enterprise system and we've developed the C. S. U. D. H. heats up. This app will be of use to all students across the campus and one of the things it does which is pretty revolutionary. Is that it sets it up so that any student on campus can find out when an event is taking place where food is being provided. And therefore can go to that event receive free meals free food and doesn't have to encounter the stigma of walking into a separate building on campus. This is innovative relates to the partnerships we do with the larger community. I want to thank my comp my colleague got Chris my requests are vice president. Of information technology for champion this another applause line. And then the third area as I mentioned the C. issue system we've always been about access were now about completion with graduation innovation twenty twenty five. But in the C. issue Dominguez hills is the leader in going to the third area that we haven't talked as much about. Which is thriving and in our system it's going to all be about thriving what happens to students after they graduate. We have a saying on campus are model was once a Toro always a Toro. So we're committed to lifelong learning of our students we want to be able to provide Mike or certificates micro credentials badging. So that the student graduates from here five years ten years fifteen years. Is going to be able to get re skilling upscaling to keep them on the job market and being resilience that's another thing that we're really committed to. And I would say without also if you saw recently in The New York Times. There was a review. About social mobility in the op crossed all colleges the United States. In the state of California Dominguez hills was ranked fourth out of a hundred sixty eight colleges. In terms of so just for mobility this means upon graduating. Two or more quintiles and earnings after they graduate university for me that's the mark of success and something that we will continue to use again once the Torah always a Toro. There many more things I was given five minutes so I've condensed a lot of it so we can get to our panel but it's our honor to have you on campus and I'll turn it back to you now senator Glazer. Thank you provost at great overview and your campus is on the rise it's great to be be here and hear the stories and learn from what you're doing here as we learn from all the campuses that we visit. I wanna I welcome our first witness set that's gonna share their expertise with us today it's Jeff gold he's the assistant vice chancellor for student success initiatives at the California State University. You have a global view of how we're doing around California not just the Dominguez hills view which you're gonna hear from and just a few minutes but- I would love for you to talk about the C. S. use graduation initiative the twenty twenty five targets that have been set. How we do and where we go on right maybe where some places are we need improvement welcome circle fantastic. Thank you so much. Actually get real close in as well. I just want to start off by thanking you folks I mean especially as we were talking this morning senator Glazer about turning down an invitation from the governor to celebrate the signing of your bill. I think that says something to me should say something to everyone in this room. The fact that you're all here giving this time the fact that this road show continues. From your many stops and tomorrow you'll be at Pomona. It sends a signal to everyone in our office to everyone in the on our campuses but I think more importantly throughout the state of California. But this is important to you that you value this. And so just let's give the senators a big hand for their time can. So they get started I'm I'd probably take a step back quickly to just give us a little bit of context as many of you know. Three years ago we got together as a system with cross representative group from all campuses different. Positions within the campuses. To set some of the most ambitious goals. For completion inequity. We set goals so high that the CSU system is known as a public comprehensive university system. We aim to be first and best amongst our peers when it comes to graduation rates and equity. As proverbs back to mention we have always been known we take great pride in the fact that our student body. Our diverse student body. Medics and looks just like the great diversity in the state of California. Where we've needed to be much more intentional is with. The completion rates with. Facilitating the group that path to high quality degree fall of our students. And so right now as we fast forward three years from those states only set as ambitious goals. I'm thrilled to be able to report that we are doing tremendously well on almost all of our goals and let me explain. As a student in the C. S. C. when I see that there's some students the room today there has never been a better time. To be at the C. S. C. with regards to student success. Let me say that again because I think it's so important. In the entire history of the C. S. U. there has never been a time when you were not more likely to graduate to succeed as a student then right now. And that doesn't happen by accident that happens because the intentionality. Happens I mention because you're willing to make this a top priority for yourself. That throughout our campuses whether its administrators faculty staff our presidents. Just as an example our trustees. Require every two months that they get an update on our graduation initiative they want to know in every single meeting. Regardless of what's on their agenda they required an update for the grad initiative. If you had been on campus I imagine I would almost be sure. A month and a half ago you would have heard present apartment as complication. Talk about the graduation initiative get students dreaming from day one get faculty thinking from the beginning of the school year. Of the importance of completion. That happened here like it happened on twenty two other campuses. As we go through the arteries of the campus whether its faculty staff. Administrators we are all thinking and doing the same things. Being intentional about how we can better support our students. And that's why we see the improvements with regard to the equity. I have to remind us that we are looking back. I'm somewhat. So it's almost like looking at the stars. In seeing them the. The reflectance cutbacks for six years later. But we have made some really important progress. In terms of policy. So in terms of equity we have made about a one or two percentage point improvement for the first time in our act by closing Mike equity gaps of this last year. We have a lot more work to do there. But that comment about the stars is because when you look at what happened a year ago. As many of you know was the very first time in fact I think you highlighted the set your forum. At Santa Monica college about a year and a half ago. We changed as a system a policy that was unequal unfair to us a significant number of our incoming students. In particular students of color in low income students. And by doing that we got rid of with the stroke of a pen. The remedial education program that we had which basically said students at the same time. Welcome to this yes you work five year here. But if you don't jump through these hoops to finish these courses within a year. You're gonna. And so you can imagine disproportionately. Students of color low income students first generation students were in that group that was relegated to those courses. But I couldn't be more proud in fact I think for all of us in this room. This will be one of the most important. Policy changes for student success in the in our lifetimes. After one year of that policy change we're seeing that eight times the number of students of this last year. Within one year eight times the number of students. Were able to complete their general education math requirement in that very first year. So maybe in closing just at a high level what I've described is I often get asked in formal and informal sessions. How are you guys moving then you know how are you able to be successful with your system for its on the graduation initiative. I really have to two pieces of. Two responses to that question one as I've mentioned is that intentionality. Across the board from our external partners to state legislatures. To our our internal faculty staff administrators there's an unwavering commitment to student success in the intentionality that goes with it. Number two is very important and I know it's early in the year to be mentioning this are talking about this. But student success is not free. A quick choirs money for us to launch the courses to support our students to higher the tenure track faculty. To teach those courses to have the propria by users and the wonderful support structures that. Provost back in the mentioned those are not free. And so we really appreciate the support of the state legislatures along with the governor's office to help us be. Where we are now which is close to the full funding. Of the graduation initiative three years and- so with that about Beth final thank you I turn it back over to you right thank you doctor gold a couple of questions for me and I want to. Open up to my colleagues for follow up as they see fit. As he talked about the change in remediation and we did hold a hearing on that and I was very pleased to see that policy change because I think it was discriminatory. At the same time we hear that the trustees are considering increasing. Math requirements could you address at that and maybe share your same thoughts about whether or not. You think we may be heading now in a different direction. That that may have some affect on the- the fit is within our admissions yeah really. Really good question I think we lose a- really good question and so the question is really about what we're calling a quantitative reasoning requirement and it sounds like semantics changing the word from. Math quantitative reasoning but what we're looking to do with our board in fact it'll go up for a vote next month and skews me too much. November is to ask that our high school students who come to us take an additional course in additional a three G. course. In something related to math so when of course but you know it can. Be to programming. Of. Course find a course for the such. And the idea. Not only of their of the entrance requirements. But also to become better prepared to enter into a discipline such as spam. So what we're seeing now we talk about equity gap says this binary. Gap between graduation rates between students. But if we were to look at the graph at the composition of students who are graduating and spam versus non stern for example. You see significant. Said significant variation in the students were eligible and go into those more high paying. More sought after careers and so part of this initiative overall for the quantitative reasoning requirement. Is to ensure that our students not only have an equable chance when they answer. Once they enter they have an apple opportunity to choose a major. That will prepare them for the future. So there's no doubt that the whole stem areas a place you want to encourage student participation and success and for their sake and for California say. It's there are many degrees are offered on a campus and non stem degrees. And I don't know what that proportion as- where that kind of quantitative reasoning really isn't going to find their success here in college and in life. It's certainly at. That's a similar criticism of the standardized testing requirements were so much of it is based on your success in math. And yet in the humanities and political science and sociology and so many other. Fields of degree that those those those just not it's valuable and certainly we want kids to have that well rounded education which our general education focuses on. For everyone. But our week again creating a gate. Rather than an open door for so many that just don't are dependent. Irrespective of your acknowledgement of how important and valuable stem students are. Yeah so I think that maybe before I answer that just the you know a little bit of clarification as that had we been looking to require for example that everyone take calculus or precalculus course. I would completely agree with you however when we talk to the employers we go out to the community and that's one of the top skill sets the graduates require all of the mentioned this quantitative reasoning it's this financial literacy it's the ability to use numbers and logic. So we are not just to be clear talking about all students being required to take a calculus class were talking about them having additional practice. In that fluency with new numeracy that will help them second party question I think is a really important one and if you've been watching our board meetings and watching the community engagement. There's been a very lively and I think hardening debate about this and the truth is we will never know exactly what will happen six years from now so the policies that excuse me seven years from now in terms of access. Policy has a seven year window running up to it where we have the opportunity to get better help help create better partnerships with our case while partners to ensure that the very worried you have the concern that we share does not happen. And that window as we talk as we talk about preparing. Teachers and students as well for this new requirement that the next time we've also built in a kind of a do no harm clause so the idea is that you are. From an underserved school de in the fall you are not able to take those courses that I mentioned kind of the computer programming financial literacy or any type of science or math course. You you will not be held you'll be held harmless in terms of your ability to come to the C. issue. That Schering. Those thoughts in order I do watch all the trustee meetings. Yeah we are paying attention. Some of us. Let me also let me go now to. Another space which is. The in concert. He among the campuses on their four year into your trap programs. We're gonna talk about Tom and Gisele's in a few minutes but let's step away from the biggest fills. Data that you provided as it breaks down every campus that's participating there are significant differences. And some of them are very positive and encouraging like at Sacramento and San Jose and others like it cal state LA it is just what's going on and that doesn't seem like. That that there's really commitment to the program and we're gonna talk about that in terms of. The ability of a student even to know about that for your track and that's an issue I happen to make us cells and want to hear more on but- how are you tracking the consistency of application I know you say comes up a trustees meeting that's good. And as I understand it it's a part of the presidential reviews which is good. But how engaged are you conceding the advertising that's going on on the campus is just to have kids get into the program let alone having to be successful within the program yeah that's a good question and I think it's important to note that there are programs separate from the California problems promise. That aren't exactly the same in letter but they are for example Phoenician for type programmer complete into so before the legislation there were some campuses that were already you know reaching out and having these types of arrangements with their- with with their incoming students both freshman and transfers. And so I think that discrepancy really has to do with where folks are working offices are or they have been it just takes awhile for them to can okay message out there I know a colleague of mine was at the counter conferences for the entire. State of California for this do you. Just months. Five in caps there's talk. The college props and made sure that people knew counselors know that adviser it you too bye. To let them know that this opportunity exists. So I think that there's a couple things I think you're right to say that there's it unequal implementation of the California promised throughout the state. And that you're seeing strong growth in some places and not as quick up taken others. But I also think that we need to look beneath that to see that. For students who don't check the box for California promise. There are other programs that are very similar and in fact. You don't provide stagnant talked about his graduation rates tripling over the last five years. As the system right now we are at about twenty five and a half percent having started at nineteen. Again none of us are proud and want to stand back on our laurels about where we are. But we have moved the way that we talk about graduation we have moved the way that we frame it and we have moved the way that. Our faculty or staff at our administrators especially advisors. Are are are having people. Get ready for that. Very good and I up when I go to my colleagues for their followers but- I encourage you to. As M. perhaps you do go to any campuses website. And say where do I find the Phoenician four or the cal promise whatever you wanna call it. How hard is it for me. To find that that program that exists here. On a campus of I want to get through in four they're going to help me get through it for and I. I think if you take that challenge. You will be challenged. It will be very difficult to find it here at to make a sells it takes six clicks. Six links to try to find the California promise program here to make the cells and to make this hills is not unique in that. It just doesn't seem to be up the promotional efforts to inform kids that that I can see in you may be in a better position to see it but I. Encourage you to try to take that take that challenge. Senate artillery you had a follow up question yes thank you I'd like to acknowledge the provost because your- passion I could feel it. That you know where you're at and you realize you've got to get to that next level and I understand that like knowledge that. And you we can be successful if you don't realize that we're not successful and then to implement the plans and obviously the- the faculty the students all have to feed into that. Same yeah. But I would think you meet. Really have a- big punch in this thing. Is to reach out for the to your students. The ones are coming in from the community colleges. As if they've got two years invested they got two years ago you can immediately. Implement a plan that'll get your right up there. Because these numbers are. Somewhat embarrassing to be quite honest with you. And thank god you're here. Because now you can change with every everyone here. And this could be the first step. To go forward. So I'm thinking and here's my question to you Mr gold. What what do you think you need to do to. To bring in that goes to your students. That will help your numbers because we need to get these numbers up. And I know we got the issues pertaining to. To healthcare and food and- and how Jean everything else. But these to your students I think they're already on the path. What do you think yes we need that to your standard talk about communicable edge students who come here right. And graduated to yeah I think so yeah. I think that we are already seeing it in our numbers at as a as a system. We set a goal at the time I believe our our to your I. tuition rates were about thirty percent. Or less for up to your transfers there now sitting at five. So book I'm I hear your Senate I always in this uncomfortable position. Of I don't know some defensive because not for a minute we think that forty five is the end all be all we want that number be even higher. But in terms of setting a stretch goal of 45% of our students. Completing in two years were now sitting at about thirty eight in our preliminary numbers say that we're going to be this year so. We're just calculating and finishing calculating the graduation rate data. For degrees through summer. And so that's why I was back to mention that he has some numbers are preliminary our preliminary numbers are telling us. They were to get even closer about forty five. We have room travel. I think it does take a little bit of time and we're seeing that happening now. For students to a at the community colleges be aware that this even exist we're seeing those numbers exist. And then on our end to arrange the curriculum in such a way that we facilitate every step of the way. For students to have that opportunity to complete in two years. Let me follow up on his chair. That we have the interview process when they're coming in. About the exit process when you find a student. Who's about to say I can't handle it I don't have the patience I got to that they get. I mean the sit down and find out why. And how are we losing you. And what what should we have done differently you have do you have that process. Yeah I love it I would not in the system office because we don't have the students there but many of our campuses are doing exactly what you're talking about and- not even. Not only that I should say but when there are warning signs so sometimes when they already have left it's too late or they're about to leave. But a couple steps before when the signs are there that this is a Steven our data tell us. That the student is in danger of leaving we have proactive advising who read. Yeah but visor to reach out and say let me really better understand what's going on. You need to stand rolled. We need to do more to support it to graduation. Thank you. Okay Dr gold thank you for your testimony I. Hope you'll hang around and now they come back thank you. Well let me welcome our first expert from the campus. Doctor Meru Figueroa. Thank you for being here you are the interim associate vice president. Who has taken over the graduation rate and Phoenician for and transfer into program here to make a sales as I understand it. I told you the university wide academic advisement testing and learning center. Activities here on the campus is that right. Thank you for your good work there you previously at Northridge or some pattern going on here. Were you served as a coordinator for freshman programs. Were you provided that counseling to first time freshmen. Dealing with academic and transitional issues and- and all the rest so we appreciate your expertise to look for your testimony. Today thank you for being here. Well thank you so much for the opportunity to share our story with you. I know some of this has already been surefire Provo stand by Jeff as well. But California state Dominguez hills is born from the struggle of the people that surrounded the area. And although the demographics of our local area have shifted. The content the community continues to reflect the struggle and the resiliency. A high percentage of our students as you heard. Falling to three high risk categories which is spelled recipients. Are in need of additional academic support. And belonged to historically underserved population in addition to that as you heard. Percent of our students identify as first generation this is significantly higher than the C. S. U. overall. These all have been correlated with low completion rates in college. However this the student characteristics are not barriers to college completion when appropriate academic supports are in place. Rooted in our institutional mission we firmly believe in delivering transformational education experiences that emphasizes equity accessing inclusion for all students. We utilize these three quartermaster rate a holistic approach to supporting our strings that begins in the first year. Dominguez hills was one of forty four campuses selected to participate in ask use the association of American state colleges and universities reimagining the first year. That redesigned the first year of college to create sustainable change for student success. In two thousand fifteen Dominguez hills first year experience lunch also known as D. H. F. Y. E. and it provided all of our incoming freshmen an opportunity to have a shared experience that included four points a proactive in intrusive advising. And that's fine your mentor or coach appear in peer academic support in the form of tutoring and supplemental instruction that targeted are historically high D. of W. courses. A summer bridge experience and a connection to campus. At the forefront of all of this is our faculty who have supported who have stepped up to the challenge of re envisioning and re imagining the court the curriculum to be responsive inclusive and engaging. Studies have demonstrated the generation C. students appreciate practical real life experiences. They want more hands on application of course work and are interested in applying them to social issues that are important to them. At the Mingus hills faculty have maybe intentional effort to create high impact practices such as the first year seminar or more commonly known on our campuses during seminar or fact in faculty continuously developing gauging scholarly experiences. To support their transition from high school to our university with an intentional focus on social issues advocacy and career planning. Through the nays competences as a guide and niece is the national association of college employers. Faculty participate in a learning community to provide a space for critical analysis in fact and reflection with intentional professional development sharing of best practices and identifying opportunities. The Dominguez hills transfer learning community launched in twenty sixteen with a focus on supporting our transfer students. And career readiness through our do the design your life course which has demonstrated increases in career. Self advocacy agency confidence and resilience. At the same time we brought together a unified in cross divisional team of faculty staff administrators and students to analyze and address Brokeback's to college completion. This team developed a pay it forward grant which is awarded to students were identified as having a specific remote requirement preventing them from graduating. Since twenty sixteen four hundred and thirty six awards were made to students who committed to completing this requirement and last spring or summer term. 86% of the students who were awarded. The pay it forward grant have completed and earned a their degree. This is a total of approximately four hundred and seventy thousand dollars. That have been funded by a our academic affairs budget. The remaining students all have been supported to develop an academic plan to move forward. The California promises instrumental in supporting the objectives of the C. S. U. twenty twenty five graduate initiative. Here on our campus known as a torrent Vassar program which encompasses the Phoenician for and that through into. We've developed an intentional program that is high intensity and high touch and provide students with the opportunity to become involved on campus through high impact practices to help them be successful. This over to who stern Robert just a pie participate have one on one meetings with program coordinators to develop there to work for your plans. Meet regularly with the academic adviser they are connected to their faculty advisors and the major. They participate in service learning and research. And indeed with the career center and the Torah learning and testing center. Students will participate in the California promise programs have tracked have been tracked. And the data suggest that our demonstrates I should say that students successfully complete their degrees and two or four years. And four are on track to do so. These students the student success initiatives that have brought together a committed faculty students staff and administrators. Have been funded with one time funding. And we thank you the legislators and the chancellor's office for the support. For the support and supporting our stern success initiatives that have helped us achieve as the probe was mentioned and also Jeff our graduation rates as you have seen on the mountain big building up in addition one other significant move is the student mean unit load. That we have been projected for this term at thirteen point one. This is up from eleven in twenty in twenty fourteen. Given the enrollment growth C. S. U. DHS experience we're at a point in time we're we're taking a critical look at how to scale and sustain momentum that we have built. Part of looking at this is also insuring the well being of our students basic needs a mental health issue had mention. Thank you okay thank you doctor Figaro I appreciate the overview I a big fan of your first year seminar I'm a big fan of your pay it forward. Grants and certainly I know I'm joined by my colleagues on the panel and doing everything we can to. Create more one time money or on going support and the seventy five million I think it was in the budget this year I was on top of the seventy five million. Before but let me ask you this and I know there's a person's. Chances office so we can't like have our own little private conversation. If there was something that you feel a what are you not getting here. The cells with some very influential people here. On this panel what are you not getting that we can help you get that can make you more successful. So I think you know Jeff did mention right resources one time finding is great and we greatly appreciate it but it's about sustainable funding to continue the work that we have done what we did at Dominguez hills we did not have dedicated positions for the Phoenician for or that they're going to we did receive the funding and we adjusted positions we tweaked position descriptions to be able to support the work and what we need is really dedicated folks that are dedicated to the out reach into the support into out reaching also to our faculty. Out you know because one piece is also the student outreach but it's also the faculty how do we engage the faculty in the process to build a these mentorship opportunities to build these coaching opportunities for students because we are also focusing not only in the two and four year graduation but we also want them to continue to be successful after the after they graduate with that that's graduate school or going back to what purpose Agnes said going into the into the private sector in in their own professional careers. So we're gonna hear from the faculty in just a moment but the big question that I had coming here and still remains and. It's not just at when students get on the track they want to get. Four years or two years and what the university's doing to support that that all sounds great we really wonderful. But what surprised me most is how few students are. Making themselves available for that for your tracks because they don't know about it is because- they know about it added the thirteen thousand only a hundred say ow I care. You talk about the unit load being up which is a great indicator. Of a commitment to getting a degree. If the if the average degrees lotus thirteen point one that's close to a full time load. Here at university meaning they want to get through they're not just slacker it's and just coming here for a couple classes. The book of the students here want to get through and still are not able to. And yet only handful of signed up for the- you know that the cal promise program so how do you explain that what's the reason for that. And so going back to what I have shared with you we did start the Dominguez hills first year experience that is a program that all of our first year students participate in. This started before the California promise came onto our campus our transfer students are also engaged in the transfer learning community. And so with that our students although they're not participating in the California promise and one of the things that I think internally we are. Taking the time to reflect this how do we scale this up part of what I've shared with you is also having the appropriate. Human resources and funding to be able to help us find increase that. But our students are part of going back to also but Jeff said other initiatives that have been on our campus all students have participated coming in when do you Jeff I. E. transfer students have the opportunity to participate. In the transfer learning community as well. So although that we don't see the big numbers in California promise as of now. There are other initiatives on our campus that are supporting our students. Well we're gonna hear from doctor Wallace's second I wanna throw props out his way because when I went to that too the student union today for lunch. And I saw all those wonderful signs talking about mental health challenges. And the stresses and strains. I thought man this is a campus OP did just put him up today. But this is a campus that gets it that it's not just about some you know isolated like. Try to find our connection this is like in your face. We care about you if you're feeling at. This this is like. We have a warm embrace here. Out is that happening for the California promise Sir so I gotta get doctor Wallace to come in to the California promise program here because- I'm feeling that connection on mental health. But I walk around the campus yes. And so all of our incoming students to hear about it on starting at orientation. It is shared with them during their orientation and follow up workshops. On there also it also issued with them during during their advising appointments. So we do have various points where students are hearing it and we are sharing this information. I didn't know when you said that it took about six clicks on our website to find it. I know that as a university we have been looking to connect to continually improve the way that Google searches happen on our website. And so I know that that's something that we have undergone but I will go back and look at that. Occurs doctor figure I have the six clicks. Okay well. Then I can make a bad I can tell you how difficult it is to find really I can go through everyone. Just to find the California promise program it's almost impossible honestly it. And I if you don't have. This you you can go look it up and I guess I won't embarrass you by. But we've done that we looked at six and you have no idea even how to even get there you could even find it again there's no bread crumbs even finding these six. I hope that you'll look at that Jeff. It your students here and yes it's a diverse student body. And yes you have more Pell grant recipients and all the rest I get all that. They want to get through in four years or two years they want to get through it cost them more money. Thousands drop out because they can't. They want to get through here. There is a narrative that has been used by some that says. There's all these barriers for students all these demands in their life they don't really want to get through now. That they want to get through here they want to get that degree because they know how valuable it is we got to make it easier for them and we do as a university recognize that we do have students on our campus. And most of them want to get the route two and four years and we also recognize some of the students that. Will not take you to one four years and I think it does provide an opportunity for us to really look at. The work that we're doing and how do we continue to scale the work that we're doing at Dodd S. center Archuleta asked a question about datum almond go. What kind of data you collect he also asked a question. About the seniors that are so close a few classes away maybe one or two when you talk about the pay it forward grants. Can you address those two questions he asked earlier terms of what kind of data are you collecting about why kids are falling short whether dropping out what do what do you know that you can share. So we have of and a teen. Advice or or actually couple of advisers who are working on reaching out to the students that have left our institution. To one find out what why they have left our institution and more importantly if they're looking to come back to our institution what we have found it through those efforts it efforts is that. Many of. The students to leave because they have life. That happened. And dot just spins and then we talk about okay if your goal is to come back how do we get you back onto campus. We do have a returning Toros workshops that help students walking through the process of how to come come back and reactivate onto our campus. There are issues that we do find where it is financial and it's having that conversation with students and walking them through that process so we are. In in the stages of collecting that data and you'll and I think them important pieces not only understanding why they have left and how to help. Them come back. But it's also being able to use that information to prevent future students. From leaving if we know that these are the situations that our students are encountering how do we- how do we prevent that from happening moving forward. And then the second question I'm sorry what was the- the data. And then that those that are so close. A classic two away sides the pay it forward brands anything else that you're doing to. Identify those seniors that. Are right on the verge. And I think that our graduation initiative team of. Our graduation and an innovation team is the group that again. Came up with the fate the pair we develop the pay it forward grant and that team meets once a month. To really identify those students that are on. The cusp right that they have one requirement one class. In it's not just about identifying the students but it's about how do we support that students in a lot of cases is that one class. That is only offered. Every spring semester and were in the fall semester right so how do we work. With the student with the colleges with their chairs or where there are with their majors. To be able to support the student and completing that degree so this does happen this team comes together once a month. To review some of the student cases and more importantly to share best practices and address ways that we can support the students moving forward very good follow questions Senate Archuleta. Yes I just wanted to follow up thank you for your enthusiasm. If this paper. Right here I'm looking at it Jeff would you like to graduate in four years. Eight you must give us. Fifteen units per year. Be you must maintain a C. average. Sign this contract we'll make it happen. Just that simple how many students you think would sign this from a freshman class. Just that simple. And I would imagine just about every fresh but today. I'll sign that for years. C. plus. Fifteen units. But we're not asking up. In and I think we're here to try to help. So if a freshman class came in. And out of two thousand and a freshman class a thousand said I. man. You only have two hundred. Then you need to ask us. For more faculty. For another building or two. You know what we're asking you to give us more graduates but we're also asking how. Can we- and I think this would be a start because- your answer provost and everyone should you want to be more aggressive you want better numbers. Give us this. And I'm open to that. Whatever that might be. And in thank you so much because I think that if we do put that form out there yes we are going to get a lot of responses but we also. What we recognize that our campus is that we want to build a holistic program and support to ensure that not only are they telling as yes but that we are building all the support that they need to be able to move forward and be successful not only here. On our campus and beyond our campus. And I think that the dilemma that the center argillite is raising is that. We're committed to helping but- more resources and you only have a hundred and twenty kids. In the program what is that. That is that the demand that we needed now. Deal with with you know hundreds of thousands of dollars more when. Somehow we have to marry those two. If you have a robust program. We want to make it successful but if we don't see a robust program it's hard to justify the more the money so somehow we have to. Work that that issue through. Alright with that I thank you very much doctor. For your great work here on the campus appreciate it very much. As I mentioned earlier we have a great representative from the academic Senate. A doctor Charles Thomas thank you Dr Thomas your being here you're the chair. Your business law assistant professor. So I can't. You advise students interested in law school which is fantastic. But we thank you for your leadership of the faculty here. And we appreciate your insight you can bring to our discussion today thank you. Thank you senator Glazer the select committee on such success. As well as the staff and volunteers that make the state. Senate college to a reality. I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide a few words. Our it's important for us to focus on the in a relationship between student success. Often measured by those graduation rates. Alongside the bear years such as hunger. Housing in security and adequate mental health counseling and services. Addict academic success. Not be pursued without acknowledging the foundation. Of having steady housing or enough food to eat. Not on the chair the academic Senate here it act C. S. U. D. H. where are but business law. For the past. Moreover I live within walking distance to the campus representing an investment in the long term viability of this campus and the community it serves. In many ways I reflect our student body. Like 63% of our incoming class I'm the first in my family to attend college like 82% of our incoming class I'm a member of an under represented minority group. M. like 70% of our incoming class I was Appel recipient throughout college. Yet despite the similarities our student body faces a significantly more expensive collegiate landscape then when I attended college. The Sacramento bee reported on may first of this year that it costs close to fourteen times what it cost forty years ago back when you senator Glazer graduated from San Diego state. And that is adjusted for inflation. Fourteen times the cost fifth. Costs this I'm sorry I raise my voice our students have been taking a longer pathway to college degree. Check your early at the junior and senior levels roughly 28% of our juniors in fall of twenty eighteen attended part time. In over 30% of our seniors this represents double the CSU system wide average for juniors for fall of twenty eighteen. In contrast to our students I went to college full time taking out loans not only for tuition but also for living expenses on campus. I find our students are far more conservative in their student loan choices not taking out the amount of loans that I felt comfortable taking out now I still have educational debt. So I really can't fault them for boarding student loans. However. This leads our students to enter into the work force adding additional demands upon their time. Similarly commuting the campus keeps our students within their existing familial relationships placing yet another demand think child care elder care on their time. Some of the research literature implies that those with thirty plus hours of outside commitment largely work including caretaking can't thrive and be successful with the fifteen unit load per semester. Now our main unit load has been improving currently at twelve point four for the campus and thirteen units for incoming freshmen but we're still not at fifteen. In this is the context that frames are four year and six year graduation numbers. S. faculty we are proud of the work that we do with students and C. S. U. D. H.'s ranked fourth in the state for social mobility where students have secured earnings that are two quart house above. Their parents earning rates C. S. UT age is where transformable social mobility happens. Faculty is C. S. UT H. forge pathways to meet the needs of students for example sociology professor Katie Pinto was recognized by the chancellor's office for her innovations and graduated pricing. In addition the university advising center works closely with faculty advisors and mentors for me to college with several faculty participating in a fellow it buys in program. Why we continue to make strides towards our graduate initiative twenty twenty five goals we are also attempting to address our long term student needs with building new dorms on campus. Transitioning this campus from principally commuter to principally residential will provide students the option to join a living learning community on a campus to minimize those outside commitments and I just previously discussed. We're also making efforts to measure the level of our basic needs on the Dominguez hills campus. Our campus wide survey goes live in two weeks this will help us to accurately identify the extent basic needs are unmet on this campus we will hopefully inform campus policy and funding moving forward. In the mean time. The campus is engaging in out reach for its cal fresh program we are a leader in affordable learning solutions for textbooks we are utilizing a food recovery network for campus dining and for our campus farm we have developed a weekly farmer's market that brings fresh fruits and vegetables to the campus community we've developed a basic needs act which the provost has told you a little bit about. Our and we have established funds for emergency housing and pay it forward grants. But we also know that the current need outpaces the supply. At the start of the semester as academic Senate chair I. room recommended that all faculty include in there still apply resources for food and housing and secure students as well as announcing the upcoming basically survey student affairs is also provided the guide of resources for faculty and staff. To direct students. S. faculty we often serve as Sir get support for students that their families cannot. Because they simply have not navigated the system. This support includes teaching time management establishing strong personal and professional identity and develop a sense of belonging in the academic community. In this sense the faculty are influential in the development of our students and remain committed to their life long learning. As we say once a Toro always a Torah. And again thank you for giving me the option to speak to the select committee on student success thank you thank you doctor Thomas and I'm up I'm particularly appreciative of the work that you and your faculty members of done on I guess you call universal learning this were books don't cost as much as at the fundamentally what it's about yes. That they can access the- the study materials without this enormous costs that's a fantastic thing that you and your colleagues are doing it's a big deal those are huge costs for many students and- I appreciate the work of your faculty to try to make that better for kids and I also want to. Applaud you and your colleagues for the syllabus idea and identified in in in many spaces not just a on a website we're out those who have basic needs needs can get some help so thank you but let me say I know we have some time issues here but let me give you one question. If there were you have a magic wand now graduations get two wishes to improve the four year graduation. Rate here at to make this sells well with those two wishes be. Additional resources specifically. Toward making this a residential campus okay. And in terms of supplemental instruction equivalent to what we see in the first year experience for the second third and fourth year grace okay those in those enhancements to create better connection and engagement and support absolutely wonderful ideas and I'm glad you're excited about the dorm and I think that all the folks who are smarter than me recognize the advantage of a residential community and how that can take care of distractions as you described. And keep greater cohesion and add. And continuing education which was what we're all striving for so thank you any any other questions yes the only member thank you thank you professor Thomas you know I. I your your your comments reminded me when I was on the. The assembly budget committee when. Governor brown then governor brown first pushed the four year graduation initiative. You know we all understood that that if his is intent was to. Try to open up more opportunities by by getting more students in and out of our universities and there by. You know a graduating more students but- there there was one comment that. That the governor brown made that I thought was perhaps reflective of. The different perspectives and the different life experiences that. That we need to make sure we are listening to people like you and your students. You know when you talked about how. So many of your students are so busy working. You know to be able to put themselves through school. They don't have time to be at attending a lot of. Programs and it reminded me. Governor brown talked about all. And back in his day. You know he took the meandering that road through life and you explored in now. In many different ways but- yeah in the end and it immediate met the criticism from many students that were at that hearing. Saying that we're not meandering were just too busy working to put try to put ourselves school and so. You know. I mean I. I am listening to this the station of course you know we always. You know. For hueso government market in and. Faces some of that day the most challenging economic circumstances with with your students and so I. I want to make sure that that that that. You know that the policy makers are in touch with the reality and I think that's why we're all here and I want thank you very much for comes. This state is the only member I would just say just in terms of a statistic that you could point to. Would be the average age of our juniors and seniors compare to the CSU system. Are the average age of our juniors based upon fall of twenty eighteen was twenty five point three sorry for the point three of years but- it is. What it is. Within the system it is twenty two point nine. So that difference of two point four years what difference does that make well it's called life. And all the set if you become betrothed you now have a child you now have a- fireman to were you have. The dish familiar quiet it's the types of. I feel. That I needed some time. Will inhibit our ability despite our best intentions to get. Jean every single semester. Just want to provide that is the context comparatively to other campuses. You know again you could look at ethnicity on this campus vis a vis other campuses. There's a number of different factors I just want to point to that mitigate against the ability for all to graduate fifteen every single semester just because the life experience. Okay thank you thank you very much doctor Thomas for your great testimony I want to grant you both of your wishes. I've deserve their other fantastic and I certainly think that we all share those goals and we'll work together going forward thank you for your testimony. I next up up Morgan Kirk is here you're the coordinator of. Basic needs here on the campus as I understand it you have a masters of science in higher education. And higher education administration another key thing we've heard earlier used to work at CSU Northridge. Owner you. Right I mean. Where did you go to school I went to fuller ten and where you come from before you came here Las Vegas Nevada okay well let's use that part. I got a north ridge. Anyway we welcome you and look forward to hearing your about your work here in the campus thank you. Hello and thank. No I went out here it is. Just gonna speak louder right in the Mike. Can you hear me now yeah there we go. It was not that long ago that our society frequently jokes about college students surviving on top Rahman and couch surfing. Many of us knew that college students experience food and housing and securities however we did not realize how prevalent it was and we did not feel quipped or empowered. To address these challenges. Today the climate around basic needs is changing and we truly appreciate your efforts to happen tension dialogue. Regarding what our students are experiencing and how our campuses can offer holistic services to support student success. I'm sure you all are familiar with the cal state chancellor's office basing these initiatives study. Data stating that 41% of our students are experiencing food insecurity and ten point nine of our students are experiencing homelessness within the once or twice within the first twelve months. The study revealed that students who identify as black African American and first Jim students are more likely to experience housing and securities. Amongst their peers additionally former foster you've students are doubles that number by 24% by experiencing housing and securities. This data from the chancellor's office basing the study has been extremely helpful and advancing our understanding of what our students need moreover it has elevated conversations around what colleges and universities can do better to support. Students and in need of food and housing. Deep the demographics of our student body and the preliminary information we gather from our via the our basic needs program we believe that the number of students experiencing basic needs challenges I. cal state Dominguez hills. Is larger than what the study indicated. The number of students who have a role to add D. H. has increased by 33% by the year two thousand. This music terms of people that the number who were likely to experience basic needs major by the hello triple proxy. Has grown by three thousand five hundred ninety seven students in the year two thousand to six thousand and ninety four and the year two thousand ten. And eight thousand eight hundred and thirty three in the year twenty nineteen this year. This is a significant number of students for whom our campus aims to provide outreach education services and follow up. Layered onto this the campus has a significant number of first generation students this is an indicator that the student is not likely to know that resources are available or where to find them. This number has also increase from two thousand nine hundred fifty five in the year two thousand to six thousand and ninety five in the year twenty ten and then currently eight thousand one hundred and seventy two this year. Like many other institutions in the CSU system. Our campus has been working diligently to develop a comprehensive basic needs program. In addition to a current budget request this will allow us to hire our first case worker on campus. We are addressing basing these issues are Dominguez hills by maintaining food pantries providing emergency funds mercy housing and collecting data to better understand basic needs challenges on campus. Our campus currently has three food pantries one of our food pantries provides perishable items as well as as well as non perishable items. Are food pantries receive fresh produce from my campus urban farm and local nonprofit organizations. Over the past academic year we had thirteen hundred unique users and have used utilize our food pantries thirty three hundred times. We have a cow fresh food program that provides students were application assistance CalPERS has served over a hundred eighty eight students this past academic year. Our students are able to use their benefits at our local farmers market and they're able to utilize the market match. The market match program there. For those students who experience hardships and do not have access to any financial assistance. DH has institutionalized the faculty and staff student support grant in the spring of twenty fifteen and our students are able to apply up to a thousand dollars. Not surprisingly homelessness fiercely impacts of students ability to remain in school and be successful students were sleeping in their cars faces serious several issues including safety nutrition and hygiene. When students experience homelessness chances are all areas of their basic needs are being compromised which in turn will impact our students academic in mental health. Here at cal state Dominguez hills homeless students report being pre occupied and beat sorry students a report being pre occupied by hunger in class thinking of ways they can find their next meal and leaving class to get unhealthy items from vending machines. In order to support our students last year we began offering a mercy housing for students who experience housing and securities we have two one bedroom units at our university housing and students are able to stay there for up to ten days. We are able to accommodate those students who may have children to ensure that we are serving our students equally. Those ten days we work with our students to connect with them connect them with our local nonprofit organization called path which is people system the homeless. To identify temporary and rapid re housing. These students are follow throughout the year and or connected to on and off campus resources. On October twenty third we are launching a campus wide basic needs assessment to a certain the accurate numbers of students. Who are experiencing food and housing and security as well as mental health and financial hardships we hope to have those results available in the spring semester and then streamline our programs to be as responsible as possible to students needs. If. Hello there. It is important to me to reiterate that none of this would be possible without the great support we have received from our local community. Campus leadership and our student leaders such as associate of students I'm confident that we will continue to make strides and how we support students who experience basic needs challenges. Thank you again for your time and advocacy. Thank you thank you for that review and- certainly the numbers that you shared with us our our- more than disappointing their shocking and depressing. Thirteen hundred unique users at your food bank. The I'm glad that the work you're doing on emergency shelter for those that. Have no other alternative I'm I'm glad to hear that you're collecting data this October twenty third survey is great. I think we all know how important that facts are for making good choices. Going forward. And if you had two wishes. That you could be granted I can imagine why yes you got one what it what would they be. I wanna is ongoing funding for programs so we can provide sustainable resources for students. And to assist. To continue on de stigmatizing housing and food and security on campus. And which we are doing as a program to inform and educate others on campus but we want to break down that barrier so students don't feel embarrassed to come to our program to read. Receive the services that they need for them to be successful. Yeah well. Double wishes yeah and- the application that was cast that. For food and security to try to deal with that stigma issue and the acts that. It things. Certainly is a step forward there and- I'm when you talk about I'm going Monning. What what part do you have with the county. I mean are they partners in what you're doing I resources that we give to counties that they receive are they are they coming here to the campus to feel like your connection is. On the funding side with the county is together are Dennis students is currently in the room so he'll be able to answer that. Our our. That your choice at your option Jean it's nice to have you here. He's right is that the above my pay grade question kind of yes. They need to do that I'm sorry no you're fine. Just talk loud into it okay so right now are really the basic needs program is still really in its infancy and we don't. Necessarily have a strong partnership with the county in terms of access to funding what we have done up to this point is look at partnerships to immediately solve some more of the more immediate needs of students around housing and food. And so do our basic needs initiative a committee on campus we've been in conversations about how we can better leverage what we're doing here with our local part partners including our city and county partners and so that it that's on our radar that we're looking to take advantage of as we move forward I encourage you to do. That because what it's something that we have heard our campus tours and other places where a lot of times that the college campuses are seen as like islands like it's we don't have to go there they kind of got their stuff together. And the counties completely ignored forgetting that if you're responding your basic needs of your community you can't just say that them and not us and we got a we got to reestablish that partnership and that obligation there so I hope that you work on that yeah absolutely. Thank you I thank you very. Jean anything else. Yes if I could just follow up on that so what steps. Does Dominguez hills take to identify the students who are cal fresh eligible. So do you want Anthony women he yeah steps wikihow fresh the end what what steps you take to identify the students who are cal fresh eligible and what would you do to encourage them to apply yeah of course so couple ways that we try to make sure that students are eligible is that we meet them where they're at so our coverage and turns are currently in different departments. As you may know we do have a coverage how fresh eligibility for students so if they have cal grant a RB they may look eligible if they work twenty hours per week or eighty hours per month they may look eligible if they are part of I. Toro guardian scholars foster you or are your P. programs they may look eligible. And so our students are also at the forefront at our farmers market so they can applied there so those are some ways that we're trying to catch the students in C. they may look triple another resource that we provide within our basing these programs called a hot meal program and so students are able to receive this fifty dollar card but in order for them to receive it they have to go there khao freshen C. they are eligible for some benefits. So that's another way or another step that we are taking to ensure that students are. Obtaining sustainable food while they're here D. H. that are Bradford. Doctor but in all corners get. Okay very good well thank you for all your good work here. On the campus in such an important area that should not have any stigma to it whatsoever. And speaking of unfair statements. It's a great lead and the doctor Wallace in your work and the whole mental health issue and again my- my compliments for engaging the community and one way in which we saw. Just today and- just speaking honestly about mental health and mental health challenges and eliminating that stigma issue. Which is unfairly placed on those who are stressed. But we welcome you you're a psychologist here in the campus. Usually the efforts and mental health and we welcome your testimony. Well first of all like to thank you senator Glazer and- the- select committee for give me the opportunity. To speak about on mental health issues and the way in which we addressed those here at Dominguez hills so. I guess I would like to I've heard a lot about like the four year graduation process and I've been thinking a lot about that and what could be. Interfering with that and is it has me thinking a lot about like my own Jerry. I went I was scholarship students so I went to school in the four years and in in the scholarship for undergrad. But my graduate journey was a little bit more difficult and it took a little bit longer. And when I reflect back on that I think one of the major challenges was something Connie imposter syndrome. And that was a lack of belief in myself a lack of belief that I deserve to be a doctor. And I think they got no way of me pursuing it as quickly as I could. With that comes a lot of data a lot of anxiety fear when you're at the finish line do I want to step out in. Not have to do this is Bob along here. And I think a lot of our students here to make you still struggle with that as well. You know. The sense of do they belong today deserve to be seen. Today deserve to have these things that they haven't had. Into their lives on it so a big part of the work that we've done is to reduce stigma. But also to empower students to recognize that. They have important voices important contributions to the world. They're. Not just. Afterthought. So I would like to talk a little bit about the services that we do provide here. At the counseling center so we do individual sessions group sessions we do crisis interventions so if a student is coming in with. Some acute crises they can come in and be seen that day. To just that issue. Aren't we also focus a lot on outreach. And senator Glazer you were speaking to the earlier where you saw the ways in which we kind of push the message out there. And let the students know that we're here to serve them. That's something that's a huge passion of my own because I found that. In order to get reduced at stake my number in to increase the level of comfort in being seen. By a therapist you got another therapist is. You know the students need to see our faces and see that we're we're normal people. You know. It's just the conversation. And once. They're able to connect the face to those services it becomes much more comfortable much more easier process within the coming in is and be helped by us. On and it's also a great opportunity to kind of just educate students in the public as a whole about. Mental health. It take away this kind of false idea that. You know Mitchell health struggles are something that other people have. When in fact all of us can relate to anxiety all of the related depression. And so it's a good way to kind of just like normalized that in just let students know that if they are experiencing things like that that's not a sign that you don't belong here. That is the side your normal human being and we have ways to help you with that. And so. That's a big focus of ours just getting that getting that. Message out there. Something else I'd like to bring up to is in my work with students I've noticed that like. Not only life hidden away in terms of like having to work. But Sirius trauma like our students are dealing with. Real actual trauma. That a lot of our students are coming from communities where there's violence. Live where there's life or death issues going on. So those type of things kind of like. If we think about hierarchy of needs right. You know we need food we need shelter but we need to live and stay alive. And so if you're focused on that if you're focused on just surviving is very hard to kind of like had those extra mental resources available to do your algebra homework. Or things of that nature. And so for one many of us in the center we wanted to get like special we're wanting to really focus on that Tom and help his students process that trauma. So they can take away that have a place to kind of. The deal with that extra layer of psychological psychological stress and burden. That could interfere with just the ability to pay attention in class and things of that nature. So because we're short on time I like to just open up the floor for any questions you may have thank you doctor Wallace and I think that the reason. That we're talking about mental health is because for many of us we recognize that it it can be as important as food and housing it is that important and that statement doesn't belong. And can you I don't wanna put you on the spot can you tell me how big of a staff you have here at the at the university dealing in your counseling center. Up we have approximately ten of full time counselors and asked taking like if we combine some of the halftime counselors that's how we get that number of ten. And if I'm a student and I'm stressed out very stressed out and I call and I said like to come in for an appointment how long when I have to wait to get an appointment. Act honestly that depends on like the time of year that you Connie and so like there's certain high periods. Like let's say mid terms finals where we have a higher demand on our services. A in times like that there could be a significant weight time up between four to eight weeks right. I wanted to get the I wanted you to put that on the record because it's- it's a four day weeks they're right here that four to eight weeks. Just not acceptable. No that's not your fault I'm not don't get me wrong hidden but that that's not acceptable. And I we we've heard that when I was a trustee at the time at least. The testimony was that on average in the state among the twenty three campuses. The average wait time for students says I need some help. With three weeks. Andy here to make a sales when I look at the ratio of students to counselors. It's way below average yeah that's not good that's not your fault but that's the reality here. Is a lot yeah sockets and I. Just wanna I want to say that. It resource demands are everywhere on campus I get that we understand that. And if there's things that we need to do in the legislature to help with that issue. I'm certainly want to step up first to be that help because- we have got to make sure that if kids are stressed out. Not suicidal there's a difference in I know that you would recognize that difference but- we cannot happen waiting four to six weeks. To get help that keeps them in in school it literally. Keep them in school happened drop out because they can't take it. And the signs that you had out there today was very powerful. Would you share a couple those messages the reality check on. The stressed out nature of your student body can you share some of those facts that you have on the sign. I don't know the exact factory assigned record to speak from my experiences there. The number one thing that our students. Are struggling with is this anxiety. That's the number one thing that students are coming in for. Particularly things like testing side. You know. And I think again that ties back to like struggles. In terms of like believe that they belong that I'm here to do this you know. If you're struggling with that self belief. Of any kind of set back in a class like a bad. Scored a testament to sign me can reinforce this is that I don't know if this is for me. And so I think anxiety is the number one driver was bringing students into our services. Also I think. A lack of sense of community. Right a sense of isolation because it's a huge transition coming from high school to university. N. transitions always bring stress with them and so I think. Experience in those those transitions and the stress that come with those transitions kind of again fuels that anxiety innocence of disconnection the students on can feel on campus so I think a steps in as as a community is a very important thing as well. So I took a couple pictures some of the sign messages. One of them says that 76% of your students felt physically exhausted within the last twelve months seven six percent. Here's another one. it was difficult for them to function within the last twelve months 35% said they were so depressed was difficult Steven function. There was another one on how many students you have contemplated suicide do I recall it right around 14% your number. Yeah so these are these are real powerful and scary and worries some facts. And I hope and I hope that we in the legislature in partnership with the campus can can do more. You need more help yes I'm I need more staff definitely okay. We mostly got to find a way through that pathway it's very very important he so we're gonna open we're gonna close in just a moment. But I want to mention that at all of our public hearings in the Senate and the assembly we have an opportunity for public hearing. For anyone who would like to share some thoughts with us and we're going to provide for that in just a moment. But I want to give my colleagues on the panel the chance to ask any follow up questions and then closing remarks. Well first off I'd like to say thank you to everyone. But I'd like to apologize. I'd like to apologize. Because. When we started I said I wanted to listen. And not only did I listen but I heard you loud and clear. You're dealing with students that come from all kinds of background the diversity. That is here number one. In the system as far as diversity. The need financial economic that that is devastating and somehow full. Of and you're dealing with every kind of student. So we may have walked in here gave me the impression was. Why aren't these numbers right. Why are these numbers I see. Nine point five when I looked down the list and- and I C. San Diego at forty six point six. I see she co at ninety twenty nine fuller Janet twenty five in your at night. You may have thought that's how we came in. Well maybe we get I apologize for that because now I know that if you had the scale balance. In a lot of different ways this thing would get the other way around. You would be in that eighty and ninety percent. Sorry. Because I had mentioned earlier that I had to send to graduate from west point. And then I tell you about my one of my daughters. And she graduated from Chapman college but she graduated with four kids. And a husband that they had. Some physical problems because of an accident and she would not stop going to school yes I help yes my wife and I bush the bush she had the family when she finally made it but with four kids in the classroom sometimes so imagine that scale so I've told her that you get a much better than your brothers. At west point it didn't have to worry about tuition you have to worry about anything but you had to worry about those for kids so. You've changed my mind I tell you the support that I wanna root for and fight for is not just the academics on this side but the things that you need you need additional teachers you need professor you need more help financially you need these kids will be able to survive that last few months so we're gonna look into that and I'm going to recommend that. To senator Glazer that we could help in a lot of different ways these numbers will change to god bless you for what you're doing you're taking this challenge. And you meet it head on. Thank you. So I wanna let the other colleagues at some closing remarks M. ago that senator Bradford and assembly member next. Again let me think US senator Glazer for putting this hearing on to give him a round of applause for. This important issue our students six Josh. And we heard a lot of challenges and obstacles that error impeding a student's. Ability to graduate and it's clear that we have to refocus our priorities the legislature's well because for the last twenty years our main focus has been about admissions getting your number's up getting your number's up getting your numbers out. For the most important are just as important is getting those graduation numbers up and we have to refocus our priorities now because we've been talking about admission since ward Connelly and how do we- provide a diverse student body but- it's not enough to get him in the door we got to get a mop. Toward well as graduate so that's going to be I party and I knows senator Glazer about the remediation and that's of great importance because the legislative black caucus were our service device year. We did a tour two years ago and visited a variety of students throughout the state of California and we realize. Regards to work that kid in front of you. It's far more clear she was far more likely to remediate and repeat classes that they had already taken. Yet ance calculus you name it AP courses they had to do it more so than their counterparts and I think it speaks to something we fell to talk about as well when we look at these numbers and when I saw the nine percent. I wasn't judging cal state Dominguez hills but I can implicit bias that we face. People of color. And educational system and housing and all those challenges so that's the issue that needs to be talked about as well M. needs to be addressed implicit bias that still exist. And our education system. And how do we fix that and it won't be overnight but it's gonna be through. Being willing to have honest dialogue. And I and working with individuals such as yourself to deal with this on a daily basis so I'm recommitted myself as a- alarm of this fine university I know what that commitment is. No hard work you're doing to. Take message out and recruit young people who are have the biggest challenges some time to get to college and we need to find a way to X. I'll he did have one question. Of the housing the units. That you have are they pretty much bill your round. Honestly it just really depends on when our students need it but I. Spring semester was filled for the whole semester. Great thank you center Bradford thank you for your great leadership and yeah and passion in higher education and certainly for Dominguez hills thank you very much for being here SLA member to G. thank you for being here thank you. I just wanna wrap up by the thanking everyone for a- your presentation I think one of the challenges that we face. As as California lawmakers is that in a while we are working so hard to expand access to. Higher education opportunities for all. That as as- you know college education has become. You know what used to be primarily the province of the middle class. In in decades past that now we are. You know reaching out and bringing in. You know because so many diverse populations with with different challenges and I and I think your presentations really. You know reminded us that that with. The expanded axis comes expanded challenges and expand across. It all right I wanted to follow up good looks like we're running out of time I know what. Sir Glazer try to move things along here but that doctor Wallace I love to talk to you more later on. Because you know. Like my- my district I represent you know some some very low income working class communities. A harbor city harbor gateway. But also. Very affluent communities man at these pelts for. M. L. on this issue mental health it's just. I am just trying to figure out why they Atkins ID. Precedence side is spot being a all different communities. But I mean. Things yeah I mean I had things when I was a kid what's different now you know. What is it that that anxiety depression suicide express biking. Not all in the aft communities man at beach palace Verdes. But also in. Here are. With your students at the thing is stills and so. You know there's this whole conversation is really. And highlighting the need for a for policy makers you know what's happening. On the ground and I for the following. Thank you very. Which I'm looking forward to and more conversations could happen as we walk around campus but if you'd like to please. Identify yourself if you wish and let us have your thoughts. Good afternoon and thank you for coming to Dominguez hills my name is Carolyn to no go. And I'm a graduate student studying public administration you're entering a sales we're also earned my undergrad degree in business. Little fact about myself is that I enjoy taking surveys. When I transfer to Dominguez hills. It from City College of San Francisco answered an email that contained a survey entitled the C. S. U. food and housing. Housing security survey. That survey. Search hello. Now we all know that one in every four CSU student is food insecure and one in every ten our housing and secure. I myself am currently housing and secure and don't have permanent. Residency due to high cost right. Basic needs and so basic needs support and mental health care is vital for students successful and because I'm very passionate about. I currently serve as the AS I. director of legislative affairs. And last year I was the executive vice president for finance for the cal state student association. I've shared my story of food and security as well because at one point during my undergrad years I held for part time jobs during the semester just to make ends meet. Students should not have to print choose between graduation or groceries. Since the basic needs basic needs conference that happened in Sacramento in two thousand eighteen. I mean it does has made great strides in addressing stern Gaines. We have three food pantries a hot meal card program. Graham an urban farm and a market match program at a farmer's market for students who currently have coverage benefits. I also currently work part time as the caliphate food coordinator on campus. During the first week of school me and my intern signed up over forty five students for cal fresh benefits. But there's still more we can do. Passing legislation that makes the cal fresh program a more seamless process for students. So they can be approved for more benefits can help more funding for the cal grant program so that students can have access to financial aid. Art and here on campus opening a larger food pantry would definitely help us. I know that everyone in this room cares about this issue. And we should all you need to come together to find innovative ways to ensure all to me still still still safe secure and supported. Thank you again for your time thank I thank. Thank. Thank you for sharing your personal story as well as your leadership on this issue on the app is very much appreciated thank you so much. Yes. Hello my name is hawk make beds and I am the graduate research in terms of the basic needs department I'm also my master's thesis is funded in part by the chancellor's office and basic needs grants. I'm encouraged that psychological wellness is part of the basic needs conversation now. Of and I want to also suggest that financial wellness be included in the Maslow hierarchy actually my live park you could probably be. Dismissed and- favor of a more holistic solution. Including financial wellness environmentalists which can address the environments that our students are coming from as well as transportation issues. I want to suggest cultural wellness be. Part of psychological wellness but its own so culturally competent courses and of environment that is gorgeous. Culturally competent and culturally responsive to our students from where they come from. And also social wellness which includes childcare which is a real need I'm very preliminary findings from a study that I'm doing right now points to child care. As one of the life things that happens I'm not just having a child but dealing with when they get sick where do we put them when they're on spring break and we're not. I'm as far as becoming. Pretty campus which I'm really I'm a big fan of that wording and that mission. Over the summer as the former cal fresh coordinator over the summer I worked well worked with them the foundation on our campus and with campus dining to try to get easy T. implemented on our campus and EBT readers are students can have a place. To spend their cow fresh dollars currently there's no guidance from the that I could find from the chancellor's office or from the state to the systems. To try to streamline that process and I'm not sure if I would just wasn't looking in the right places or not. But I basically. It and there's no personal key point person within the financial management system that it would be required to do that or would have that guidance to do that and it's basically up to whoever at the university from what I've been able to see can do that. Some of the people that were helping our student workers and you may or may not know that student workers are restricted to twenty hours a week. So they're not able to work a full time job. Many of those students are also. Some of the ones were sleeping in their cars and are worried about whether meal is going to be coming from. So what can we do as far as student worker rates go increasing those maybe relaxing that our requirement I don't know what the solution is I know that their students are in need though. I appreciate the fact the efforts our faculty and of being de facto. Psychologists when they're on a six week waiting time I know I use them. As as such I'm not sure if they're- prepared for that all the time. I understand that when you have you really want to increase awareness for programs that are on campus. It's really hard to do that when you have one person running your programs of. As far as. Increasing if we're going to be. Of student centered scampers but has students living on campus we need to create. Faculty of I'm sorry family housing. As well as a dining hall. And the last thing that I haven't heard mentioned in this entire hearing is the needs of undocumented and makes that a student's. They are not eligible for cal for ash or many state and county. Services and there and the most of some of the most need they're eating out of the candy dishes sometimes. So this concludes my thoughts thank you thank you thank you hi thank you for coming and sharing. Thoughts. All right anyone else before we close the public hearing part of our- alright. Well let me just say in summing up but thank you to the university for having us here provost back. Thank you. For all your hospitality and that of your staff doctor goal thank you for your continuing work on the system. Our graduation initiative doctor Figueroa thank you for your work here on the campus. More conversation still to have. A doctor Thomas thank you in the faculty again and the staff for all the to help. Make our students successful. Miss Kirk thank you for the great work in basic needs that you do. And doctor Wallace thank you for. This bringing us some start testimony that's very important that the apart all the conversations we have. About student success. I'm I know this that that Dominguez hills is a very special university here in California. And California as a state cannot be successful. Unless Dominguez hills is successful that means all the students that are enrolled here on the campus. And I think all of us are committed to doing everything we can in partnership. To make our university here even more successful. So that every student can thrive at every level. Because they have a roof over their head because they have food. In their stomach because we're taking care. Of mental challenges that they may face. And because we've created pathways for success. To your pathways for transfers. Four year pathways. For freshmen students we can do that and I know you're all committed to it so I think all those who have participated here in the audience and those watching. And with that ladies and gentleman are a- hearing is adjourned
