WE HAD REQUESTED THAT THERE

THE BILL ONLY HAS TWENTY FIVE

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:09.862
AND THOSE FIVE DAYS MIGHT MEAN A

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:11.463
LOT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN RURAL

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.898

IS WITH REGARD TO THE FEE.

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:33.252
AND THE FEE IS GOING TO BE

00:17:33.318 --> 00:17:35.521
