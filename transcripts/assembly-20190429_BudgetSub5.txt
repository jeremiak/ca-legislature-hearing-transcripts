THANK THANK YOU BETTER GET YOUR MEMBERS IT IS THE SO OUT OF IS IT OKAY IF I BEGIN WITH THE YOUTH CHALLENGE PROGRAM WHY NOT. SO THAT'S THE THE SECOND BUDGET ITEM IT'S THERE THE SECOND PART OF IF ISSUE. ONE AND ITS TO EXPAND IN EXISTING PROGRAM THAT. WE STARTED THREE YEARS AGO DOWN IN LATER OF WHICH IS NEAR STOCKTON. CALIFORNIA IT'S OUR THIRD CHALLENGE PROGRAM. IN A OBVIOUSLY OUR NEWEST AND JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR CHALLENGE PROGRAMS -- WE HAVE ONE IN LOS ALAMEDA IS ON OUR MILITARY BASE THERE WE HAVE ONE IN SAN LUIS OBISPO AT A MILITARY BASE THERE AND THEN. ON A NEW MILITARY BASE AT THAT WE JUST ACQUIRED IN LES THROUGHOUT -- THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE AIMED. AT GETTING AT RISK YOU THESE ARE HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS OR FOR HIGH SCHOOLERS WHO ARE A SEMESTER OR YEAR BEHIND WHO HAVE A ZERO POINT. SOMETHING GPA AND WHO WILL DROP OUT IF SOMETHING ISN'T DONE -- THEY VOLUNTEER TO COME TO OUR RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS IN EACH OF THESE LOCATIONS WHICH MEANS THEY LIVE WITH US WE ARE THERE LEGAL GUARDIANS. AFTER THE SIX MONTHS THAT THEY STAY WITH US THEY WERE UNIFORMS THEY ARE -- THEY ARE SUBJECT TO VERY STRICT DISCIPLINARIAN BUYER MEANT -- THAT IS MODEL THAT IS -- MODELED AFTER OF A MILITARY EDUCATION MODEL. IT'S EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE THE BOYS AND THE GIRLS ARE SEPARATED THE AT THE ONLY SEE EACH OTHER WHEN THEY PASS EACH OTHER IN FORMATION. THEY GO TO SCHOOL ALL DAY THERE'S MANDATORY STUDY PERIODS WE TEACH THEM HOW TO EAT MANY OF THEM DON'T KNOW HOW TO EAT A NUTRITIOUS WHAT A NUTRITIOUS MEAL LOOKS LIKE MANY OF THEM DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXERCISE. PROPERLY MANY OF THEM DON'T HAVE COPING SKILLS -- AND SO THEY ADDRESS -- PROBLEMS IN THEIR OWN LIVES IN COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WAYS WE TEACH THEM HOW TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS IN THEIR LIVES IN PRODUCTIVE WAYS. WE CARE ABOUT THEM AND WE MENTOR THEM AND THIS IS ALL DONE AROUND THE CLOCK BY OUR MILITARY CADRE. THIS IS THE FEDERAL STATE COUNTY PARTNERSHIP OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAYS 75% OF THE OPERATING COSTS THE STATE PAYS THE COUNTY IS THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION ESTABLISH AN OLD ALTERNATIVE HIGH SCHOOL AND I PROVIDE TEACHERS CURRICULUM BOOKS AND ALL OF THE OTHER MATERIALS -- THAT YOU WOULD IN AN ORDINARY HIGH SCHOOL THIS ONE JUST HAPPENS TO BE A RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM. THE OUTCOMES ARE EXTRAORDINARY BOTH IN TERMS OF GIVING THESE. AT RISK YOUTH SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE -- MANY OF THEM -- WELL NOT MANY OF THEM ABOUT A THIRD -- ABOUT A QUARTER TO A THIRD GRADUATE WHILE THEY'RE AT THE PROGRAM THEY TYPICALLY. GET ABOUT A YEAR'S WORTH OF HIGH SCHOOL IN JUST SIX MONTHS AND SO IF THEY DON'T GRADUATE AND THEY GET CAUGHT UP WITH THEIR PEERS. THEY GO BACK TO THEIR HIGH SCHOOLS THEIR PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS -- AND THEY TYPICALLY HAVE THREE POINT FIVE FOUR POINT NO STATE KNOW HOW TO STUDY THEY KNOW HOW TO SUCCEED AND THEY HAVE HOPE AGAIN. AND THEY KNOW THAT IF THEY A STAY ON THE PATH WILL SUCCEED. THE THE THE PCP OR THE I'M SORRY THE BUDGET ITEM PROPOSES EXPANDING THE DISCOVERY CHALLENGE PROGRAM. IN LATE THROUGHOUT -- BY PROVIDING AN EXTRA PLATOON SO THERE'S THERE'S FOUR PLATOONS IN A FULLY MATURE CHALLENGE PROGRAM. DISCOVERY BECAUSE IT'S SO NEW ONLY HAS THREE THIS WOULD ADD THE FOURTH AND FINAL PLATOON -- IT'S A TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL 75% OF WHICH IS FOR FEDERAL TRUST FUND THAT'S ONE POINT SIX FIVE MILLION. AND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN GENERAL FUND AND FIFTEEN POSITIONS. SO MAYBE I'LL JUST TAKE QUESTIONS IF THAT'S OKAY WITH A CHAIR ON YOURS PROPANE ONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WELL LET ME FIND IF THERE'S ANY COMMENTS FROM. FINANCE ARE LA ALL. FONG CRISTINA CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL OKAY FINE IN A CUT ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. OKAY WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR SUCCESS RATE WAS I SHOULD -- SO WE WE STRIVE TO ACHIEVE THAT 90% GRADUATION RATE FROM THE CHALLENGE PROGRAM. THE STUDENTS ARE THEN -- MAN TOWARD BY A CERTIFIED MENTOR AND TRACKED FOR TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THEY GRADUATE -- BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GRADUATE BETWEEN NINETY AND I AND A 100% -- OF OUR OF THE STUDENTS SINCE. AT NINETEEN NINETY THREE IS WHEN WE OPENED OUR FIRST CHALLENGE PROGRAM OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM AFTER THE MENTORSHIP. FOR A YER SO. SO WE WE KIND OF LOSE TRACK OF AFTER THEY FINISH THEIR TWELVE MONTH MENTORSHIP PROGRAM WHICH IS WHY. THE THE SECOND ITEM THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING WHICH IS THE JOBS PROGRAM FITS RIGHT IN IT'S IT'S REALLY. A PHASE TWO TO THE CHALLENGE PROGRAM OKAY AND ALLOWS US TO THAT AND NOT ONLY -- PROVIDE THEM. AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION. BUT ANOTHER YEAR OF TRACKING AND MENTOR SHIP FOLLOWING THEIR GRADUATION. NOW THESE STUDENTS I STILL COME FROM ALL OVER THE STATE. YES MA'AM ALL OVER THE STATE EVERY EVERY CALIFORNIA STUDENT IS ELIGIBLE ARE THEY REFERRED THERE ARE THEY VOLUNTEER OUT OF THE FIND OUT. A LOT OF INVOLVED AND FIND OUT FROM THEIR FROM THEIR CLASSMATES AND FROM THEIR FRIENDS THAT'S WHAT WE FIND WITH THE MATCH THE LA AND ON THE CENTRAL COAST. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN OPERATING WORK JUST GETS OUT BY WORD OF MOUTH. THE DISCOVERY PROGRAM -- BECAUSE IT'S ONLY THREE YEARS OLD WE ACTUALLY HAVE A TEAM OF RECRUITERS THAT GO TO HIGH SCHOOLS AND TALK TO A COUNSELOR STOCKTON EVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. WHO CAN VOUCH FOR THE THE VALIDITY OF THE PROGRAM? AND RECOMMEND STUDENTS BUT STUDENTS MUST VOLUNTEER AND THEIR PARENTS MUST SIGN A ESSENTIALLY -- A GUARDIANSHIP A DOCUMENT SO -- THE MOST THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC OF A SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGE ACADEMY STUDENTS IS THAT THEY'RE MOTIVATED HUNTER BECAUSE IT'S TOUGH. AND AND THEN WE DO OUR BEST TO TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THOSE TIMES WHEN THEY STRUGGLE AND THEY WILL THEY WILL GET HOME SICK. THEY WILL. YOU KNOW GET DISCOURAGED THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT FOLKS THERE TO TO KEEP THE MEN IN THE PROGRAM AND SO WE'VE. WE'VE. DONE BETTER THAN ANY OTHER STATE THAT HAS THIS PROGRAM ISN'T GRADUATING THAT. OKAY WANT TO GIVE US A SECOND PROPOSAL YES OF THE JOBS CHALLENGE PROGRAM IS BRAND NEW. BECAUSE WE'VE ALWAYS KINDA KNOWN THAT -- THE THE THE THE PROBLEM I THINK THAT YOU IDENTIFIED WE HAVE THIS THIS THIS REMARKABLE. A PROGRAM THAT PREPARES THEM TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THEY GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY GET OUT WHAT YOU KNOW PREVAILING WAGE JOB IF THEY YOU KNOW KIND OF FALL BACK INTO OLD HABITS. A LOT OF THEM COME FROM FROM. HOME SITUATIONS THAT ARE JUST NOT IDEAL AND SO -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TESTED A PROGRAM CALLED THE JOBS CHALLENGE PROGRAM. TO OFFER A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THESE CHALLENGE GRADUATES ONE SAVE -- GOT THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA THE OPPORTUNITY TO RE ENROLL INTO A RESIDENT PROGRAM. AT THIS ONE WILL BE IN LOS ANGELES AT OUR AT OUR LOS ALAMEDA'S LOCATION. AND IN THE SAME TYPE OF MILITARY ENVIRONMENT ATTEND -- COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHAT'S THAT WE PARTNERED WITH CHIU COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- I WANT TO GET THESE NAMES RIGHT -- CYPRESS COLLEGE AND LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE. AND SO WE'RE GONNA START WITH THE CLASS OF SEVENTY FIVE AND WE'RE GOING -- TO THEY'LL BE TRANSPORTED TO THESE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHERE THEY WILL. GO THROUGH CURRICULUM -- FOR CYBER -- YOU KNOW I. T. CYBER -- CURRICULUM AUTOMOTIVE AND CONSTRUCTION. AND THEY'LL BE IN IN CLASS WITH STILL OTHERS OTHER CHALLENGE THERE OTHER JOBS CHALLENGE STUDENTS SO THEY WON'T BE MIXED IN WITH. WITH OTHER -- COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS BECAUSE WE WANT HIM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET. BUT THE TYPE OF THE TYPE OF EXPERIENCE IN WHICH THEY CAN SUCCEED. SO THEY GET TRANSPORTED BACK AND FORTH THEY HAVE THE SAME A SUPPORT NETWORK SO -- THEY'RE FED IF THEY'RE LOOK AFTER MATHEMATICALLY -- AGAIN THEY CONTINUE TO EXERCISE AND EAT RIGHT AND THEY CONTINUE CONTINUE TO BE MEN TOWARD AN AND TUTORED. AND ENSURE THAT -- THOSE THAT ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY HELPED. AND THE GOAL HERE IS TO GET THEM THROUGH THESE COURSES AND AND INTO A PER MAIL INTO A LIVING WAGE JOBS SO EITHER INTO AN APPRENTICESHIP OR JUST RIGHT INTO -- INTO A BUSINESS THAT PROVIDES THEM OUT. A JOB THAT THEY CAN LIVE INDEPENDENTLY ON WE WANT. TO KEEP FROM HAVING TO GO BACK HOME. HOW LONG IS THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM TWENTY TWO WEEKS OF MONEY -- WEEKS ALL OF THESE ARE TWENTY TWO WEEKS LONG -- SO WILL GRADUATE EACH CHALLENGE PROGRAM WILL GRADUATE -- FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS THAT DISCOVERY AS WELL WHEN IT'S FULLY -- FULLY MATURE AND THEN THE THE JOBS CHALLENGE PROGRAM WILL BEGIN AT SEVENTY FIVE AND PROBABLY GROW TO A TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS A YEAR -- AND SO IT'LL BE ARE I'M SORRY A HUNDRED STUDENTS PER PER TWENTY TWO WEEK UHHUH CURRICULUM -- SO IT'LL BE TOO HIGH -- HUNDRED FIFTY BETWEEN ITEM FIFTEEN TWO HUNDRED WHEN IT'S FULLY MATURE. SO THAT THE FACILITIES ARE ALREADY READY TO GO -- ON ON THEIR FARM FEDERAL MILITARY BASE -- THIS MONEY WHICH IS PAY FOR THAT THE CADRE -- WE'VE ALREADY GOT -- ALL OF THE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN PLACE. THEY THEY LOVE THE PROGRAM THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT AND I THINK WE'LL FIND MORE. OF THESE TYPES OF IN STORING INSTITUTIONS AS THE PROGRAM GROWS WHICH JUST GIVE WILL GIVE THE STUDENTS MORE OPPORTUNITIES A GREATER MENU OF OF OF CURRICULA. DON'T GREAT ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS LA -- FINANCE -- OKAY WE JUST HAD A QUICK COMMENT ON THIS -- SO WE DO THINK THAT THIS -- PROGRAM IS CERTAINLY PROMISING IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN TRIED BY THREE STATES BUT JUST JUST FOR A FEW YEARS. ON THIS AND THEN IT WILL BE NEW TO CALIFORNIA AND SO I'M I'M LIKE THE YOUTH CHALLENGE PROGRAM THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT BECAUSE THIS IS SO NEW THERE IS A PRETTY LIMITED INFORMATION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS. I'M CERTAINLY IT'S VERY PROMISING CERTAINLY WE EXPECT TO HAVE -- WE WE VERY MUCH HOPE TO HAVE THESE THESE OUTCOMES SO WE DO THINK IT'S WORTH I'M HAVING THE DEPARTMENT I'M PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON ITS PLANS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND TRACK THE EFFECTIVENESS BECAUSE I THINK. THE CHAIR GOT TO REALLY ONE OF THE CREEK CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF ON THIS KIND OF PROGRAM IS YOUR PROMISES ALL THESE GREAT THINGS AND WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE WE'RE GETTING ALL OF THOSE SUCCESSES AND AND ESPECIALLY THAT WE DON'T LOSE TRACK OF THE STUDENTS -- AFTER THEY LEAVE THE PROGRAM AND SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY OUR MAIN -- RIGHT OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC CONCERNING THIS PROPOSAL ANYONE IN THE PROS MANY CONS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OKAY SOUNDS EXCITING. I HOPE IT WORKS WE WOULD LIKE TO PROBABLY GET REPORTS BACK. TO SEE HOW IT GOES IN TERMS OF RECRUITMENT -- WOULD LIKE TO I'D LIKE TO KNOW THE DIVERSITY OF THE GROUP THAT YOU'RE BRINGING UP AND FROM WHAT WHAT AREAS OF MAKING SURE REACHING THOSE. HARD TO REACH AREAS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS -- BUT IT SOUNDS EXCITING -- AND YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THIS WILL WORK. MILITARY TO PASS USED TO WORK FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE I KNOW WE BECAME VERY SELECTING PICKING FOLKS AND AND AS A RESULT OF WE'VE MISSED OUT ON A LOT OF FOLKS ARE VOICE TO SING. THAN A YOUNG MAN TO THE MILITARY TO BECOME A MAN. AND THEN WE CHANGE THAT AND UP TO OUR STANDARDS FOR ADMISSION AND WE LEFT A LOT OF KIDS WHO. PROBABLY COULD HAVE USED A STRUCTURE SO THIS WILL HOPEFULLY WILL BE HELPFUL AND LOOK FOR TO THE EXCITEMENT OF IT AND THE THE RESULTS THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. EXCITED [inaudible] YEAH. OKAY WOULD NOT ITEM TO WHICH DEALS WITH -- JUDICIAL BRANCH. THANK YOU ALSO FOR WAITING APPRECIATE THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR WEBER AND NUMBERS TO MY NAME IS LOT COMPUTER WHICH FROM THE BUDGET DIRECTOR FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL I'M HERE -- TO BRIEFLY -- EXPLAIN OUR PROPOSAL I HAVE A OUR DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES MY ACCORDING TO GIVE YOU A BIT MORE BACKGROUND ON IT -- AS THE THE CHEN DOES A GREAT JOB OF THE GIVING A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSALS -- THE NEW INDIA JUVENILE AND FAMILY -- COURTHOUSE AS WELL AS THE NEW EL CENTRO COURTHOUSES -- HAVE EXPECTED COSTS -- BASED ON OUR BIDS BEYOND WHAT IS IN INCLUDING THE BUDGET IN THE THE AGENDA DOES A GOOD JOB THEN I COULD TURN IT. TO MISTER COURTNEY TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE BACKGROUND ON ON WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT'S DRIVING THOSE COST INCREASES THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER MEMBERS SO THAT THE TWO PROJECTS WERE PUT OUT TO BID -- EACH OF THEM CAME IN IN EXCESS OF THE AUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS. OF THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE THE REMOTENESS OF THE LOCATION OF ALL PROJECTS -- EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A LOT OF POPULATION IN THOSE AREAS FROM THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE THEY'RE CONSIDERED REMOTE -- CURRENT BUSINESS CLIMATE. OF THIS VERY -- MARKET IS VERY HOT RIGHT NOW THE CONTRACTORS OR CAN BE VERY SELECTIVE ABOUT PROJECTS THEY WOULD CONSIDER WORKING ON AND THERE'S A HIGH DEMAND FOR LABOR. ALL THOSE FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASE COSTS FOR SOME FORTUNATELY -- HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. ANY COMMENT FROM LA -- OR FINANCE OKAY. IN A MEMBERS QUESTIONS CONCERNS. YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING -- AND AND I UNDERSTAND THIS AT THE COSTUME INCREASES THEIR WHEN WE FINISHED -- THE NEW ADDITION TO OUR AIRPORT -- MAYBE ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO FIVE SIX YEARS AGO ARE ARE A DIRECTOR OF AIRPORT SAID THAT TO WE CAME IN -- AHEAD OF TIME AND UNDER BUDGET AND EVERYBODY'S LIKE WHAT AND SHE SAYS WELL BECAUSE EVERYBODY NEEDS A JOB NOW SO WE CAN NEGOTIATE. FOR A LOT LESS AND PEOPLE WERE SELLING MATERIALS THAT LOT LESS BECAUSE THEY HAD ACCESS BECAUSE NO ONE WAS BUILDING AT THE TIME. AND MOST OF A SHUT DOWN OUR BUILDING EFFORTS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY WHEN IT REALLY WAS THE OPPORTUNE TIME TO BE TO DO THE WORK AND SHE RECOGNIZE THAT AT THE AIRPORT. SO WE CAME IN AHEAD OF TIME BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING FOR A JOB SO WE HAD LOTS OF FOLKS. AND WE CAME IN UNDER BUDGET BECAUSE PEOPLE WILLING TO SELL THE MATERIALS A LOT LESS BECAUSE THEY HAD EXCESS MATERIAL AND NO ONE WAS BUYING. SO IT'S KIND OF IT IT'S NOT THE CASE TODAY YEAH THIS IS THIS KIND OF REVERSE THINKING YOU KNOW THAT YOU WOULD THINK THAT THAT IT WOULD BE. EXPENSIVE AT THAT TIME BUT IT REALLY WAS IN SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED SO I UNDERSTAND. THE DEMAND NOW -- FOR FOR LOTS OF PROJECTS AND PEOPLE CAN BE SELECT WHICH IS A GOOD THING I GUESS NOT FOR US BUT FIFTEEN RIGHT. OKAY NEED ANY COMMENTS FROM -- AUDIENCE ANYONE IN FAVOR ANYONE OPPOSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK THANK YOU HELLO. WITHOUT THIRD ITEM WHICH IS EARLY -- EARTHQUAKE WARNING SYSTEM OKAY THANK YOU. TOP OF THE START WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES SIXTEEN PEAK POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS A GENERAL FUND FOR THE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING PROGRAM. TO COMPLETE ANY ONE TIME ACTIVITIES STILL OUTSTANDING WITH ME TODAY IS TINA CURRY TO PROVIDE. AN OVERVIEW IN -- FOR FOR THIS PROGRAM. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- AN INTEREST OF TIME I CAN JUST FILL YOU IN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHERE WE ARE WITH THIS. PROGRAM SO FAR THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF CONFUSIONS OF OF FUNDING FOR THIS SO FAR AND AND THEN OF COURSE AND ASK ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. SO THERE'S BASICALLY THESE COMPONENTS TO THIS EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM IT'S GETTING THE EARTHQUAKE SENSORS INTO THE GROUND WE HAD INVESTMENT OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND IN FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN MOST OF THAT WORKS COMPLETED THAT GOT US ABOUT -- HALFWAY THROUGH WHAT WE HAVE LEFT TO DO TOWARDS GETTING A THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN SENSORS IN THE GROUND AND WITH -- FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE'RE GOING TO BE. PRETTY MUCH COMPLETE THAT BUILD OUT THE PROPOSAL AS TAB AT THE STATE IT IS TO FUND -- ANYWAY SOME REMAINING ONE TIME COSTS INCLUDING A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN THAT WOULD BE ABOUT HALF OF IT -- IS FAR AS ROLLING OUT THE SYSTEM WE WERE SUCCESSFULLY ABLE TO TEST THE SYSTEM OVER THE WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT IN THE CITY OF OAKLAND JUST THIS PAST MARCH. AND THE RESULT OF THAT WERE VERY PROMISING AND WE FOUND THAT OVER HALF OF THE RECIPIENTS WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE ALERT WITH THE WITH UNDER TEN SECONDS WHICH WAS. WHICH WAS A GOOD RESULT -- WE BUT LIKE IT TO BE BETTER WE WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE OTHER HALF -- BUT THAT DOES APPEAR TO BE PROMISING AND ALSO -- WE'RE PLANNING ON WE FEEL THAT THAT CENTER NETWORK IN THE SYSTEM IS ROBUST ENOUGH THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BEGIN THE ROLL OUT OF THIS TO THE PUBLIC WITH WE AND OTHER ALERT MECHANISMS -- HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF THIS YEAR AND THEN FINALLY WE WERE WE SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE RECENTLY AN UPDATE TO OUR BUSINESS PLAN WHICH IS REQUIRED ANNUALLY. AND THAT INCLUDED A SUMMARY OF THE OF THE ITEMS I JUST DESCRIBED AND ALSO TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SUSTAINMENT FUNDING FOR THE FUTURE AND WHAT WHAT SOURCES WE MIGHT LOOK. TO I'M WITHOUT SOME HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT THE BUSINESS PLAN ABOUT THE SYSTEM ROLLOUT -- THAT -- THAT YOU HAVE AT THIS TIME. OKAY. ANY COMMENTS FROM LA -- SO WE WE KNOW THIS IS ONE OF A FEW REQUESTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT IT DOESN'T HAVE A WRITTEN PROPOSAL -- WE DO WE DON'T TAKE ISSUE WITH CONTINUING TO FIND THESE ONE TIME COSTS -- WE WOULD NOTE TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE THINK ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS THAT'S BEFORE YOU IS -- WHAT FUNDING SOURCE TO USE NOT JUST THIS YEAR BUT ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO AS THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONS ON THERE ARE GONNA BE SIGNIFICANT ONGOING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MAINTAINING AN OPERATING THAT SYSTEM? THEY DO YOU HAVE -- A BUSINESS PLAN THAT'S PROVIDED A FEW DIFFERENT OPTIONS ON THAT THEY ARE THAT THEY THINK ARE THE MOST PROMISING AYE THOSE INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE -- INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY SERVICE WHICH CHARGES ON RATE PAYERS -- TRANSPORTATION -- PROVIDERS THAT WOULD BE LIKE PARK OR OTHER RAIL LINES -- OR ALSO CHARGES ON CELL PHONE BILLS I'M SO I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY WORTHWHILE THAT THEY'VE PROVIDED -- THAT INFORMATION WE DO THINK HOWEVER THAT -- SOME MORE DETAILS WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS IT WEIGHS ON LONG TERM WHAT IT'S GONNA WANT TO DO -- FOR EXAMPLE IT'S UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE MECHANISMS WILL BE TO ATTACK US AS THOSE CHARGES IF -- YOU THEY HAVE BEEN THE DETAILS HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT YET -- AND FOR EXAMPLE IT'S UNCLEAR EXACTLY HOW MUCH TO YOU KNOW WHO'S GONNA PAY HOW MUCH WHETHER ALL OF THOSE WILL BE A COULD WILL ULTIMATELY BE IMPLEMENTED OR MAYBE ONLY A SUBSET OF THOSE CHARGES ARE. YOU KNOW IT'S JUST UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT -- WE DO KNOW ALSO THAT -- REALLY THE DECISIONS THIS YEAR COULD COULD BE PRETTY IMPORTANT -- BECAUSE IT MIGHT TAKE A WHILE FOR THOSE CHARGES TO ACTUALLY GET UP AND AND BE AVAILABLE FOR YOU SO I WE THINK IT'S WHAT. WE DO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ASK THE DEPARTMENT FOR ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON THE SPECIFICS OF ITS PLAN. FOR A LONG TERM FUNDING SOURCE FOR THIS BECAUSE WHILE THERE'S I CERTAINLY RATIONALE FOR USING GENERAL FUND THERE'S ALSO SOME RATIONALE FOR THESE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES AND LEGISLATURE WANT TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION AS IT'S CONSIDERING THIS PROPOSAL. YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT. ANY THINKING YEAH WELL ABSOLUTELY WE ARE WORKING OUT THOSE DETAILS WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHARE THOSE WITH USE OF IT WITH YOU IS AS PROGRESS AS AND WE SET UP THAT MORE LONG TERM SORT OF BUDGET INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR THIS BUT ONE THING THAT WE WE HAVE FOUND IN WORKING WITH THE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES INCLUDING THE ONES THAT WE WE FOCUSED ON IN THE BUSINESS PLAN IS THAT THERE'S ALREADY INVESTMENT BEING MADE INTO EARTHQUAKE SAFETY AND EARTHQUAKE RISK MITIGATION WE BELIEVE THIS IS ANOTHER TOOL. FOR EARTHQUAKE RISK MINUTE DATE BASIC MEDICATION AND HOW CAN THE COST OF THIS BE OFFSET PERHAPS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THOSE EXISTING. INVESTMENTS FOR EARTHQUAKE SAFETY AND KIND OF USING THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ALREADY THERE OKAY WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THAT THEM OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. STUDENTS IN THE PART OF FINANCE JUST WOULD TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS THE DEPARTMENT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT. ENTITIES THAT STAND TO BENEFIT FROM THE SYSTEM WITH ITS UP AND RUNNING AND SO TO KIND OF WORK THROUGH THE DETAILS OF WHAT THE BEST WAY IS TO ASSESS YOU KNOW A FEE FOR A LONG TERM FUNDING -- HOWEVER WE DECIDE TO GO ABOUT DOING THAT A LOT OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT TALK ABOUT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT HARD -- AND YOU KNOW AS SOON AS WE HAVE DETAILS THAT ARE READY TO COME FORWARD. HAPPY. TO SHARE THOSE AND DISCUSS THEM WITH AND STUFF ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. OKAY ANY COMMONSENSE YOU'RE WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. OF FOR THE ITEM HUMAN TRAFFICKING. TO THIS REQUEST IS FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND ON GOING TO SUPPORT THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING PROGRAM. THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL BEGINNING EN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WE RECEIVE TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS PROGRAM AS ONE TIME APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE EXCEPT FOR IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WHEN IT WAS REDUCED. ONE TIME TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THIS SUPPORTS TWENTY ONE PROJECTS STATE WIDE AND WITH ME TODAY I HAD GINA BOUCHERIE HERRINGTON. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] OKAY. THEY COMING FROM LA -- WE JUST KNOW THIS IS ANOTHER PROPOSAL THAT LACKS -- ABOUT TO CHANGE PROPOSAL -- AND THE ABSENCE OF THAT IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING LEVELS OF FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO FIND IT MORE OR POTENTIALLY LESS THAN THIS AMOUNT. ADDITIONALLY -- THERE IS ANOTHER QUESTION OF FUNDING SOURCE I CERTAINLY THE GENERAL FUND IS AN OPTION HOWEVER -- IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES MIGHT -- QUALIFY FOR SOME FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL -- SO ANYTHING THAT'S A DIRECT SERVICE TO VICTIMS -- COULD POTENTIALLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FEDERAL FUNDS. IT COVERS FOR FINANCE JUST WITH ECHO IT WITH THE INTRODUCTION WAS NOT THAT THE AMOUNT THAT STE A PROPOSED HERE IS BASED ON CONTINUING WITH THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINED TO INVEST PREVIOUSLY AND SO THAT'S REALLY THE A NEXUS BEHIND HOW WE ARRIVED AT THAT AMOUNT AND DECIDE TO CONTINUE WITH. THAT LEVEL OKAY. IS THERE ANY DATA THAT YOU HAVE CONCERNING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAMS ABSOLUTELY. I'M OVER THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS -- THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VICTIMS SERVED HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS SERVICES TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE TO BE EXACT. TO DATE AND OF THOSE SERVICES PROVIDED TO THOSE WAS TWO HUNDRED AND NINETEEN THOUSAND FORTY EIGHT AND THOSE ARE BOTH LABOR AND SEX. TRAFFICKING. LOCAL. AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED CRISIS COUNSELING IN PERSON IN PERSON COUNSELING GROUP COUNSELING CASE MANAGEMENT SHELTER SERVICES TRANSPORTATION LEGAL ASSISTANCE. AND REFERRALS TO OTHER SERVICES SO WHEN YOU DEAL WITH TEN THOUSAND PLUS VICTIMS TO SAVE LEVIN THOUSAND VICTIMS YOU'RE SAYING OF THAT. ELEVEN THOUSAND BUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ELEMENTS OF SERVICE WAS PROVIDED TO THEM SO ONE PERSON MIGHT GET TEN MULTIPLE SERVICE YES OKAY. AND DO YOU HAVE ANY -- DATA ON THE EFFECTIVENESS IN TERMS OF NOT ONLY PROVIDING SERVICES BUT FOLKS NOT COMING BACK AGAIN OR DO NO BETTER. WE DON'T DO NOT HAVE THAT IDEA OKAY YEAH I KNOW THAT'S AN ONGOING CHALLENGE BECAUSE IT'S A VERY I SERVED ON THE BOARD ONCE. FOR BATTERED WOMEN SERVICES AND AND I KNOW. IT'S IT'S A DIFFICULT -- THAT TO CRACK CAN YOU. TRYING TO BREAK THROUGH OF PEOPLES -- MENTALITY WITH REGARDS TO BEING INDEPENDENT. AND NOT FALLING BACK INTO THE SAME TRAPS AGAIN SO IT SOMETIMES TAKES MULTIPLE TIMES OF GOING BACK AND FORTH WHEN WE DID. A SPARE SHELTERS TO FIGHT TO GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THEM AND A CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THEIR LIVES. IT'S NOT AN EASY TASK YEAH AND SEE.

OKAY FINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH I KNOW THAT -- SEVERAL AREAS HAVE REQUESTED THAT -- AND SOME OF THEM DO IT WITHIN THEIR OWN COUNTY SO AND SCHOOL DISTRICT AS WELL HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN RADIO FREQUENCIES AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF THAT'S NOT. REALLY IMPORTANT FOR GETTING MESSAGES OUT OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ABOUT THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME THANK YOU. OKAY WE HAVE MISSED Và BAUER-KAHAN HERE OF MEMBERS WHO WHO HAD PROPOSALS DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO SHOW UP WITH A MESSAGE. TO YOU HAD A PROPOSAL HE'S HERE OKAY [inaudible] OKAY OKAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. DOCTOR WEBER AND COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT STAND THE ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA ILLEGAL DUMPING PILOT PROJECT. ILLEGAL DUMPING IS AN ISSUE THAT WE SEE THROUGHOUT OUR STATE WHEN WE PRESENTED BEFORE POLICY COMMITTEE MISTER LACKEY AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SPOKE UP ABOUT HOW PREVALENT THIS IS THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S ALSO AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IMPACTING THE SENSE OF WELL BEING OF CHILDREN AND OTHER RESIDENTS WHO LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE IT'S RAMP AND THE PEOPLE JUST DUMP -- THINGS OUT THE COMMUNITIES UNSCRUPULOUS COMMERCIAL HAULERS SAVE SIGNIFICANT MONEY BY ILLEGALLY DUMPING. CONSTRUCTION DEBRIS DIRT ETCETERA WELL TAXPAYERS PICK UP THE TAB TO GO CLEAN UP THE SIGNIFICANT COST TO CLEAN UP THESE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF GARBAGE DUMP UNDER CITY STREETS HIGHWAYS PARKS WATERWAYS AND OTHER LANDS. THE CURRENT LACK OF INVESTIGATION INTO ILLEGAL DUMPING CRIMES HAS LED TO AN OVERALL LACK OF ENFORCEMENT OF OUR ILLEGAL DUMPING LAWS WHICH IS ENCOURAGED THE NORMALIZATION OF THIS ACT. OTHER CITIES COMMONLY RECEIVE INVESTIGATIVE LEADS RELATING TO LEADING. RELATING TO THIS ILLEGAL DUMPING FOR THE PUBLIC MANY POLICE AGENCIES DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR THE RESOURCES TO INVESTIGATE THE LEADS BECAUSE THEY'RE FOCUSED ON VIOLENT CRIMES AND MORE SERIOUS OFFENSES. ILLEGAL DUMPING INVESTIGATIONS ARE TYPICALLY TIME CONSUMING BECAUSE EVEN IF A SUSPECT AND LICENSE PLATE ARE CAPTURED BY VIDEO THE SUSPECT IS COMMONLY NOT THE REGISTERED OWNER OF THE ASSOCIATIVE VEHICLE. THE INVESTIGATIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FOLLOW UP. TO DEVELOP SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO FILE A CRIMINAL COMPLAINT. OR CITATION. THIS PILOT WILL ALLOW THE FUNDING OF TWO FULL TIME OFFICERS ONE EACH COUNTY WORKING TOGETHER IN ORDER TO BUILD NETWORKS INVESTIGATE AND STOP ILLEGAL DUMPING. AT THE END OF THE ONE YOU'RE PILOTS AND THEY WOULD REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE HOPE IS THAT THIS WILL SET UP A PROGRAM THAT WILL ALLOW FOR STATEWIDE IMPLEMENTATION OF ILLEGAL DUMPING PROGRAMS THAT WILL BE MORE SUCCESSFUL AND STOP THE RAMPANT BEHAVIOR THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION ON THE SPECIAL ITEM [inaudible] ANY QUESTIONS. ANY COMMENTS SUPPORT FROM THE PUBLIC. YOU WAS WONDERFUL. OF WHICH TO CHOOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF FOR HEARING I REQUEST FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR FUNDING FOR A PILOT PROGRAM THAT WOULD ALLOW CITIES AND COUNTIES TO OFFER INMATES. MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. THOSE WITH A HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR SICKENING SIGNIFICANTLY OVER REPRESENTED IN OUR JAILS AS A RAND STUDY A FEW YEARS AGO FOUND -- THAT 58% OF ALL INMATESREPORTED A PROBLEM WITH DRUG ADDICTIONS USE OR DEPENDENTS. NUMEROUS STUDIES OF MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT SHOW THAT IT IS VERY EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION THAT COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SAVINGS MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. INVOLVES A COMBINATION OF SPECIFIC MEDICATIONS AS WELL AS OTHER SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE TRYING. TO LEAVE -- THEIR ADDICTIONS. A RECENT STUDY FOUND THE PROVIDING MATT TO EVERY CALIFORNIAN WHO IS RECEIVING TREATMENT FOR OPIATE USE WOULD RESULT IN A THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR SAVINGS RELATED TO STE LESTER EXPENDITURES WHEN IT COMES TO CRIME. HEALTHCARE HIV TREATMENT EXCEPT FOR NEWER STUDIES HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT MATT COULD REDUCE RECIDIVISM WHICH RESULTS IN EVEN MORE COST SAVINGS WITH THAT I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO KAREN LÏNG REPRESENTING THE CITY COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO. TO TESTIFY HOW THIS PILOT PROGRAM COULD ASSIST MY CITIES RESIDENTS. A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR NUMBER THANK YOU FOR HAVING US -- TODAY THANK YOU MISTER TOO FOR BRINGING THIS OPPORTUNITY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AT MARYLAND AND BREED HAS ASKED THAT WE REPRESENT HER IN SUPPORT TODAY. ABOUT 80% OF THE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND BOOKINGS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN THE SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY JAIL OR PERSONS WITH AN OPIOID -- OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE AYE DISORDER THEY ARE PROVIDING SERVICES NOW THAT CITY COUNTY SOME SCHOOL DOES PROVIDE SOME SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES IN THE JAIL BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT ALONE AND AND FRANKLY IT'S VERY VERY EXPENSIVE. AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO FIND A WAY TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT PARTNERING WITH THE STATE THROUGH MEDI CAL TO FUND THIS IMPORTANT TREATMENT IN THE JAIL COULD ACTUALLY PROVIDE NOT ONLY. LIFESAVING SERVICES TO THE THE INMATES THAT ARE THERE BUT ALSO LOWER THE COST OVERALL TO THE SYSTEM THAT IS PROVIDING THEM SERVICES BEFORE AND AFTER THEY'VE BEEN IN THE JAIL AND I THINK THIS COULD WORK BEST FOR EVERYBODY IN THE WOULD. URGE YOUR PRIVILEGED APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY OKAY THANK YOU THIS IS A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM. YES THAT'S WHAT IT IS OKAY -- OKAY THIS REPORT. YES IS THIS PILOT PROGRAM OF BEING CONDUCTED SAN FRANCISCO ONLY. IT IS ALL THE WE INITIALLY PROPOSED IT TO BE STATEWIDE -- AND IT WAS NARROWED IN THE LAST COMMITTEE BUT WE ARE TALKING TO OTHER COUNTIES AND CITIES THAT ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS AND OUR HOPE IS THAT -- THERE WILL LIKELY BE OTHERS THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE OF EXPANDING IT -- WHICH WERE VERY OPEN TO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF MY CITY BUT IF YOU ARE OTHER CITIES ARE INTERESTED HAPPY INCLUDING. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THIS IS FIVE BILLION FOR ONE ONE PILOT PROGRAM IN THE BAY AREA. ENOUGH. THAT'S CORRECT AGAIN OBVIOUSLY THE NUMBER DEPENDING ON WHO ALSO IS INTERESTED COULD CHANGE THAT OKAY. RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR MUCH OF A MENTOR [inaudible] THE MISS RUBIO HERE YES OKAY FINE THANK YOU. WHICH IS. TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF FOR LONG ME TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ON THE IMPORTANCE IT THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE. OUGHT WE ARE ASKING FOR A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR OF ON GOING FUNDING FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION PROGRAMS. OUGHT WE MUST INVEST IN STRATEGIC AND STRATEGIES TO PREVENT DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE BEFORE IT HAPPENS IT IS IMPORTANT TO HELP FUND PROGRAMS THAT TEACH YOUTH ABOUT HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE CHEAPER FOR THE STATE IN THE LONG RUN. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO HELP WITH OUR OVERALL PUBLIC SAFETY. THE ADVOCATES WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SUSTAINED REPORTING ON THE PROGRESS AND THE EFFICACY OF THESE PROJECTS AND RESEARCH ALTERNATIVE INTERVENTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. HERE WITH ME TODAY ARE CRISTINA MEMSIC FROM THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND JOHN FINLEY FROM -- THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL SOUGHT TO GIVE MORE INFORMATION ON OUR PREVENTION SERVICES THANK YOU. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO GOES ALL RIGHT. RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LETTING US SPEAK TODAY AND FOR HEARING OUR REQUEST MY NAME IS JOHN LANCASTER FINLEY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO AND SENATOR BILLS REQUEST FOR FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING TO SUPPORT SEXUAL AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS. TELL COST IS THE STATE COALITION REPRESENTING EIGHTY FOUR RICK RICK RAPE CRISIS CENTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND A NATIONAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO ENDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE WHEREVER IT MAY OCCUR. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB IN CALIFORNIA OF EXPANDING OUR SAFETY NET WHEN IT COMES TO INTERVENING AND RESPONDING TO SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND CALIFORNIA IS A NATIONAL LEADER IN SO MANY WAYS BUT WE'RE BE WHERE WE HAVE BEEN FALLING BEHIND IS IN PREVENTING SEXUAL ASSAULT BEFORE IT EVER HAPPENS. WE KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA ALONE TAKING A SINGLE SNAPSHOT OF THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE TOTAL COSTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN THE STATE OR NEARLY A HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. THIS REPRESENTS TANGIBLE COSTS THINGS LIKE MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE COUNSELING SERVICES AND PROSECUTION AS WELL AS INTANGIBLE COST THINGS LIKE LOST WAGES AND LOCK LOST WORK PRODUCTIVITY OVERTIME. WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO PREVENT A SINGLE SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE STATE WE CAN SAVE CALIFORNIANS OVER TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN COSTS? INVESTING IN PREVENTION MAKES SENSE AS A WISE LONG TERM USE OF GENERAL FUND DOLLARS AND OUR LOCAL PROGRAMS AND COMMUNITIES ARE READY AND WILLING TO EXPAND THE PREVENTION WORK IF GIVEN THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE STATE TO DO SO. IT'S TIME WE CHANGE THE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA FUNDS FOR SEXUAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION FROM ZERO DOLLARS AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE ALSO NOT GO BACKWARDS ON OR FUNDING FOR SERVICES. THAT'S WHY THIS BUDGET ASK ALSO INCLUDE THE RE AUTHORIZATION OF LAST YEAR'S ONE TIME FIVE MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING OF RATE OF THE RAPE CRISIS PROGRAM. SEXUAL ASSAULT IS A CRITICAL ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA ONE OF THIS LEGISLATURE HAS COMMITTED TO PRIORITIZING AND TO ENDING. IN OUR STATE BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF OUR STATES VALUES IN INVESTING IN PREVENTION MUST BE A TOP PRIORITY WE APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS AND HOPE TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CUSTOMS I QUIT THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIPS TO AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WE'RE THE STATEWIDE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COALITION REPRESENTING THE AGENCIES SERVING WITH SURVIVORS -- ALL ACROSS THE STATE I HAVE JUST A COUPLE OF ITEMS ALL ADD TO WITH RESPECT TO THE THIS BUDGET REQUEST IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON AND CONTINUE. THE INVESTMENT THAT. THE LEGISLATURE MADE THAT LAST YEAR WITH FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR RAPE CRISIS CENTERS AND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION -- PRIOR TO LAST YEAR THE STATE GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT HAD BEEN ZERO DOLLARS FOR SEXUAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND ONLY FORTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION. WE KNOW THIS LEGISLATURE STANDS WITH SURVIVORS AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO GET AHEAD OF THE CURVE -- AT THIS STAGE WE ARE REALLY AT AN OPPORTUNE MOMENT -- TO REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE RIGHT NOW THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL HAS BEEN ABLE TO INVEST TIME AND ENERGY INTO A RANGE OF RESEARCH THAT HAS POINTED THE WAY TOWARDS PROMISING PRACTICES TOWARD STRATEGIES AND APPROACHES THAT. HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO HAVE A REAL IMPACT THE KNOWLEDGE IS THERE ABOUT WHAT WORKS THE WILL IS THERE FROM THE ORGANIZATIONS LOOKING TO DO THIS WHAT'S NEEDED IS THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THAT TIME AND COMMITMENT. WE KNOW THAT. RIGHT NOW WITH THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME THAT WAS INCLUDED LAST YEAR WE'VE SEEN. A LEVIN DIFFERENT AGENCIES FUNDED TO DO THIS WORK ALL ACROSS THE STATE -- FROM PROGRAMS LIKE PARA LOS NINOS AND LOS ANGELES TO CENTER COMMUNITY SOLUTIONS DOWN IN SAN DIEGO A WHOLE RANGE OF STRATEGIES AND APPROACHES AGAIN INFORMED BY THE EVIDENCE OF WHAT WE KNOW WORKS. WITH THIS INVESTMENT WE CAN MAKE SUSTAINS DIFFERENCE TO UNDER THIS PERVASIVE ISSUE OF SEXUAL AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY. HEY ANY OF THE COMMENTS FROM ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE QUESTIONS FROM HERE MISTER LACKEY YEAH CLEARLY THIS IS A ON AN ISSUE THAT EVERYBODY WANTS -- TO SEE THE IMPROVEMENT UPON HOWEVER. THAT'S PRETTY HIGH FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS A PRETTY STRONG AMOUNT AND THERE SEEMS TO BE. VERY MINIMAL DETAILS WISE IS SO COSTLY. AS TO WHY THE THE ASK ITSELF IS FIFTY MILLION YEAH THAT'S THE AMOUNT SO ARE OR CALCULUS WAS THAT WE WANTED TO MATCH WHAT THE STATE'S. INVESTMENT IN RESPONSE INTERVENTION SERVICES HAS BEEN THUS FAR WITH AN INVESTMENT IN PREVENTING SEXUAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BEFORE THEY EVER HAPPENED SO RIGHT NOW THERE IS -- TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS GOING TOWARD THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ALSO ADMINISTERED BY CALLOW YES ON AND THAT IS A RESPONSE AN INTERVENTION AND IS ALSO FEDERAL MONEY THAT COMES IN AND THAT MONEY DOES NOT IS NOT ABLE TO GO TO PREVENTION FROM THE VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT. AND THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY CAN PROBABLY SAY MORE ABOUT WHY I THAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE REASON NO. OKAY. I GUESS WHAT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS WERE WITH THAT MONEY DIRECTLY GO TO WRITE WHAT WHERE WE FIND SO MANY THINGS WAS SO. SUCH LITTLE DETAIL. AND IT'S I THINK THAT'S OUR JOB IS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY. WHAT'S THE FARE CLASS IN ORDER TO DO SO WE NEED DETAILS AND SO IT BE HELPFUL FOR US. TO I I DON'T SEE ANYBODY FIGHTING. FUNDING THIS BUT IF YOU GO TO HIGH. YEP THERE'S PROBLEMS YEAH WHEN WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET YOU A MORE DETAIL ABOUT HOW THE FUNDS WOULD BE ADMINISTERED THE SHORT ANSWER IS THEY'D BE. I'M COMPETITIVE GRANTS THROUGH HELLO YES -- ELIGIBLE TO PROGRAM SERVING DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE -- SURVIVORS OR THEIR COMMUNITIES -- ALREADY WORKING ON PREVENTION SO THAT THEY HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF KNOWING THIS ISSUE. WE THINK THAT WITH FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO SATURATE -- AND DO MEANINGFUL PREVENTION WORK ACROSS THE STATE BUT WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE AND MAKE SURE YOU ALL HAVE THE DETAILS YOU NEED I JUST THINK MORE DETAILS CREATURES OR STRONGER ARGUMENT FOR THAT THAT AMOUNT. AND BECAUSE THAT IS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT RIGHT NOW ABSOLUTELY AND AND IF I MAY UM YOU KNOW WITH THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THIRTEEN AGENCIES WERE FUNDED AND SELL. THE HOPE IS THAT WE CAN EXPAND THAT NOW IF YOU MULTIPLY IT'S ANOTHER. OF POSSIBLY UP TO A HUNDRED AGENCIES WE HAVE A LOT OF SERVICES THAT ARE BEING -- PROVIDED IN A THE THE LARGE COUNTIES AND THE HOPE IS THAT WE CAN -- ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES IN THE RURAL COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE KIND OF THE ROBUST -- SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE IN LA COUNTY AND SOUL SOUL YES THE FIFTY MULTI MILLION DOLLARS IS -- QUITE SIGNIFICANT -- BY I ALSO FOUND THAT SOME OF THESE -- AGENCIES DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE COMPETITIVE AND THE GRANT SELECTION PROCESS AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO AN ISSUE AND YOU KNOW I WOULD BE. OBVIOUSLY GET THE INFORMATION FOR YOU BUT I THINK IF WE CAN HELP SOME OF THOSE RURAL COMMUNITIES ALSO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT MONEY THAT WOULD HELP AND I THINK THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS. IS IS APPROPRIATE BUT I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND I KNOW. NOW THAT THIS IS MY THIRD YEAR THAT THE THE HIGHER YOU GO THE LESS LIKELY WOULD GET FUNDED BY -- WE ARE PUTTING A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON SURVIVORS AND WHICH IS APPROPRIATE BUT I ALSO FOUND THAT -- A LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T INVEST IN THE PREVENTION PART OF OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SO I MY HOPE IS THAT WE SUPPORT BOTH THE PREVENTION PART AS WELL AS THE SURVIVOR PARTS OF THAT -- THE SURVIVOR PART PART EVENTUALLY GETS -- LESS AND LESS -- THERE'S LESS AND LESS NEED BECAUSE WE'RE DOING A LOT MORE IN THE PREVENTION PART OKAY I'M -- RIGHT WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE PROPOSED IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS WHEN WE GET A PROPOSAL THIS SIZE IS THAT WE PROBABLY. WE ALWAYS BELIEVE WE NEED A LOT MORE DETAIL RIGHT AS I WAS WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING IN EVEN IF IF WE'RE DEALING WITH -- AGENCIES THAT DON'T HAVE MUCH INFRASTRUCTURE SOMETIMES THAT. IT IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO FUND BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT OR TO MANAGE OR THE VALUE WAIT. PROGRAM SO THAT BECOMES ANOTHER BIOLOGIST WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE STANDALONE A WEATHER GOING TO BE AN UMBRELLA. THAT THAT HAS THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO TO DO THE GRANT TO DO THE ADMINISTRATION OF IT SOMETIMES WE GIVE MONEY TO AGENCIES -- AND HOPE THE BILL DO SOME GOOD WORK IN THERE AND AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT EVEN DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEIR BEST EFFORTS SO THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT. WE ALSO HAVE SOME THINGS THAT ARE HERE -- AND AND I KNOW THAT. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED IN SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I FIND WITH WITH MOST OF OUR PROPOSALS IS THAT -- WHAT'S HOT WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IS GOING ON IN THE STATE THAT'S NOT ALWAYS WELL COORDINATED. BY YOU KNOW WE DO A LOT OF THINGS AND SO AS WE SAY YOU KNOW WITHIN TEETH SAFE AND HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP SKILLS WHICH IS IMPORTANT -- THAT'S ALSO PART OF A HEALTHY KIDS ACTIVE OF OF OF TWENTY FIFTEEN SO IT WOULD DO ONE THAT AT THAT LEVEL HOW DOES THAT INTERFACE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON OVER HERE. AND ON AND YOU KNOW SO IT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT THINK. ISSUES THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT -- LIKE THE ISSUE OF HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS OR OR OR THIS CASE WITH DEALING WITH -- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT WHAT HAVE YOU YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE ALREADY. AND HOW DO WE COMPLEMENT THAT AND THEN HOW DO WE MATCH THAT WITH OUR OUR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ALSO RAISE MONEY SO THAT IF OUR AGENCIES ARE DOING THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU SAY THAT ARE THERE WITH THE RESOURCES THAT OF THE YEAR. THEN. OBVIOUSLY THERE THEY BELIEVE THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL NEEDS TO FOR EXPANSION SO HOW DOES THAT ALSO MATCH WITH YOU KNOW SAN DIEGO'S PROGRAMS AT THE TO THE WHY THEY GETS MONEY. FOR A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ASSAULT AND SO WE'RE DOING THAT WORK IS THAT IS THE WORK. HALF BEING DONE AND THERE'S A GREATER NEED THIS THERE ARE YOU KNOW WHAT SO I THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE. DISCUSSION OF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL -- AS WE TALK ABOUT MEETING CERTAIN NEEDS AND HAVING OTHER NEEDS ARE NOT MET YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE WORK ON THIS AREA IS GOING FORWARD BUT MAYBE NOT AS AS MUCH AS WE'D LIKE. WITH THE YOU KNOW THE PERCEPTION IS THAT WE SHOULD REACH MORE INDIVIDUALS IF WE'RE GOING TO DO -- EDUCATION -- ARE WE GOING TO DO IT IN THE SCHOOL TO WORK WITH AND I WOULD HOUSING HAPPENING SO I THINK WHEN WHEN WE GET A PROPOSAL THIS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. WE JOIN US ON THIS MUCH MORE FLESHED OUT THEY DON'T THAN SOMEONE WHO ASKS THE TWO THOUSAND FOUR TWO MILLION WHAT DO REAL SWIMMING POOL YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO GIVE THEM A COMMUNITY. SO LIKE THAT IS A LOT SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER TO IDENTIFY THEN IF WE'VE GOT A COORDINATED PROJECT AND AS SOON. THE FIFTY MILLION GHOST OH YES AND THEN. IT IS ADMINISTERED OUT. OKAY OKAYED BY HOME I OH YES. WITH THE PROPOSES THEY GO OKAY AND SO THEN IN THE END WHO ASSESSES WHAT HAPPENS. SO ALL OF THE GRANT TO THE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE REGULAR PROGRESS REPORTS TO HELLO YES OF OKAY ACTIVITY IS AND THEN THAT'S INCLUDED WITH THEN -- YESES -- BIG REPORT THAT I KNOW YOU ALL GET BACK FROM THEM EVERY YEAR AND THEIR BUDGET COMMITTEE REPORT YEAH BUT IT'S SO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU PUT YOUR POLLS WHEN IS NICE TO PULL OUT YOUR PAGE AND PUT IT WITH IT. SO THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY BECAUSE THE DISCUSSION WHERE IF IF IF YOU'RE PART OF YOUR PROPOSAL IS THAT. YOU MAY THIS REQUEST BAY AND BASED ON WHAT YOU DID LAST YEAR THIS IS THE SUCCESS WE SHOW. THAT'S TAKEN PLACE AND THIS SHOW STILL BE A NEED SO THEN WE FEEL COMFORTABLE SAID OKAY YEAH THEY'VE DONE IT LET'S PUSH FOR LET'S DO SOME MORE. AND THAT BECOMES IMPORTANT IN A IN US ASSESSING THE AMOUNT THAT THAT FOLKS ARE ASKING FOR YOU KNOW THAT'S THE YEAR AND WE BELIEVE EVERYBODY'S DOING GOOD WORK BUT WE JUST SOME WHEN YOU GOT COMPETING INTERESTS. AND YOU HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE INCREASE RESOURCES THAT WERE GIVEN SOMEONE THAT THEY'VE DONE WELL WITH THE AMOUNT WE GIVE THEM AND THAT THERE'S A RATIONALE FOR INCREASING. THE DOLLARS THAT GO FORWARD ABSOLUTELY DR WEBBER -- I AGREE WITH YOU I HAVE A BILL CURRENTLY AND TO TO MAKE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS EVIDENCE BASED BUDGETING IS WHAT WE WERE CALLING IT. BECAUSE THAT IS MORE BECAUSE I SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION WITH WITH -- YOU KNOW I I IT'S FRUSTRATING TO ME WE PIECEMEAL EVERYTHING AND SOMETIMES -- YOU KNOW I CAME INTO THIS PLACE IT'S THIS IS MY THIRD YEAR AND THAT IS THE FRUSTRATION THAT THE THE OUT FACT THAT SOME OF THESE DEPARTMENTS ARE NOT CONNECTED. IN SIMILAR -- BEETLE ISSUES I I OFTEN SPEAK AND AS AS SOMEONE THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW ABOUT HOW I WAS A TEACHER AND THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED FROM THE EDUCATION SYSTEM INSTEAD OF COORDINATING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FOSTER KIDS ARE. ARE RECEIVING THE PROPER -- SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED FROM THE SCHOOLS WE OPERATE AND SIDLES SOUL POINT WELL TAKEN WE WILL GO BACK AND MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE ALL OF THOSE DETAILS OUT FOR YOU AND WE WON'T WILL CALL IT -- EVIDENCE BASED -- BUDGETING IN THIS CASE SO THAT WE CAN OR EVIDENCE I'LL BE YOUR DO IT BUT NO WAY OKAY SO EVIDENT EVEN. SITE AND VERIFICATION YES AND ACCOUNTABILITY YOU KNOW BECAUSE AS WE HAVE SAID ON THE ACCOUNTABILITY WANTING THERE'S ALL KIND OF LET'S BE AMENABLE TO FOR THE MONEY THAT WE WE HAD LAST YEAR AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN -- INCREASE IT BASED ON THE SUCCESS OF OF THE LAST TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT DOUBT WILL YOU GRACIOUSLY -- BUT COMMITTEE APPROVED FOR US THANK YOU AND SO I GUESS IT'S A WE'RE WORKING ON ON ON ON THE REALITY THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT SO THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW DO WE MATCH IT. AND HOW WE MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING SERVICES THAT ALREADY EXIST AND THAT'S MY ONLY THING IS THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO EVEN THINK THAT THE PART I DON'T. GET IT I DON'T LISTEN TO BLAME THE DEPARTMENT I JUST KNOW THAT QUITE OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS WE GET A LOT OF PROPOSALS RIGHT TO COME IN. FOR VARIOUS THINGS AND WITHOUT THINKING BACK TO SAY DO WE ALREADY DO THAT IF WE DO HOW WELL DO WE DO IT AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS BEING DONE IS THIS GOING TO BE AUGMENTED WITH THAT VERSES THAT. EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN PROPOSAL IN OWN IDEAS AND SO WE FIND OURSELVES SOMETIMES PROGRAMS DUPLICATING EACH OTHER OR EVEN NOT EVEN THAT ABLE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH WE'RE GIVING A HOW MUCH ARE WE DOING IN CERTAIN AREAS -- IT'S BECOMES EVEN MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE BECAUSE PROGRAMS HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES AND I JUST HAD SOMEONE TODAY THIS MORNING TELL ME ABOUT A PROGRAM. AND I THINK I SEE IT ARE WE ARE REDOING A PROGRAM UNDER SO AND SO SO ONCE ON CONFINED IT WAS THE SAME PROGRAM. BUT IT HAD A SUBTITLE. AND A PERSON DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE ACTUALLY FUNDING THIS PROGRAM BUT IT WAS UNDER SUBTITLE SO HE WE WERE BEING ASKED FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE WHATEVER WAS MILLION. ON A PROGRAM THAT YOU KNOW I I FORGET THE EXACT AMOUNT BUT YOU KNOW WAS WE WERE ALREADY KIND OF DOING IT WE WERE. AND AND AND HE HAD JUST PULLED UP THE SUBTITLE OF THE PROGRAM WITHOUT REALIZING IT WAS IT WAS THE WHEN I READ IT I WAS LIKE I'VE READ THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE -- SO MY GOD NO WE GAVE SOME MONEY TO THIS BEFORE AND KIND OF FIND IT IT WAS THE SAME PROPOSAL BUT IT HAD A NEW TITLE SO -- YOU KNOW I THINK SOMETIMES MAYBE IN THAT MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO IS BUTTE REALLY BEGIN TO LOOK AT ALL THE STUFF WITH. ONE AND FIVE SO THAT WHEN A MEMBER DECIDES I WANT. TO DO A. B. C. THEN AT LEAST THEY CAN GO IN AND AND FIND AT ABC HAS HAS BEEN FUNDED AT ONE LEVEL BUT NEED NOT TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL WHICH IS RIGHT YOU KNOW WHICH IS ALL LEGIT BUT ANYWAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO. MUCH FOR EVERYBODY TIME AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AND WE'LL GO AHEAD AND PROVIDE ALL THOSE DETAILS TO NO PROBLEM YOU HAD ANOTHER FOR POSTAL ENFORCEMENT TEAMS. IS THAT THE SAME THING NO. AB ONE OH NINE ENFORCEMENT TEAM YES WE WILL -- BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEING SUBMITTED OF AT THIS POINT TO AYE IF WE LEAVE IT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN I MEAN WHAT WHAT ELSE WAS I GOING TO DO SO SO SO WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE -- WHEN AB ONE OF NINE WAS -- WAS DONE RIGHT WAS MONIES THAT WERE BE BEING GIVING TO THE THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO FIND ONE POSITION. TO TO HELP WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION AND HELP WITH THE PREVENTION -- FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CITY OF DUARTE WHERE I REPRESENT OUT WHO I REPRESENT ON THE HAVE A PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY TO HELP TEENS GET OUT OF THAT AND SO THAT MONEY RAN OUT AND SOUL THE INTENT WAS IT'S A TWENTY MILLION OR YESTERDAY MILLION AND WE HAD. YES IT'S GONE YEAH DONE WELL YES WE DID FOR SEVERAL YEARS RIDE WAS JUST AND TWENTY AND THEN IT'S GONE SO SOME OF MY CITIES -- I DID THE PROPOSAL LAST YEAR AND SOME OF MY CITIES WERE SAYING THAT THEY STILL HAVE THAT NEED TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE NOW THAT THE MONEY'S GONE. THEY STILL WANT -- TO CONTINUE A DECAYING THE TEEN SPECIFICALLY TEENS I AND SO THAT'S WHAT IT WAS AND AT THIS POINT BECAUSE OF ALL THE PROPOSAL'S GOING ON YOU KNOW -- I KNOW THAT -- WE HAVE COMPETING UP BUDGET REQUESTS AT THIS POINT I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE OKAY BUT THAT'S WHAT IT WAS AND SO HOPEFULLY -- IF WE HAVE MORE MONEY AND DIED. WE CAN LOOK AT TO SEE IF THERE'S PROGRAMS ALREADY BEING FUNDED THAT HELP THAT -- I CAN HELP MY POLICE DEPARTMENTS GET SOME OF THAT MONEY SO THAT THEY CAN -- WORK ON PREVENTION SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU UHHUH. OKAY WE'RE NOW AT A MISTER OBERNOLTE I THINK US ON COMEY AND YES I DID. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M HERE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE INLAND EMPIRE CAUCUS WHICH I'M SURE YOU'RE NO IS JUST THE INLAND EMPIRE ****. UP SLOWLY IS GOING THERE FOR YEARS IT'S ACTUALLY ALMOST A FIFTH OF THE LEGISLATURE CAUCUS SON WHO PLAYED IN IMPERIAL NO GO HEAD. WE PROBABLY OUGHT. TO GET A CUP. OKAY WELL I LIKE TO PRESENT ONE OF THE CAUCUS PRIORITIES FOR THIS YEAR WHICH IS A REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE FUNDS TWENTY FIVE JUDGESHIPS. THOSE JUDGESHIPS WERE CREATED OVER TEN YEARS AGO BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT HAVE NEVER BEEN FUNDED DESPITE SEVERAL EFFORTS. THE INLAND EMPIRE HAS A SPECIAL CONCERN ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE SPARE COURT OF SALMON YOU KNOW AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES ARE THE TWO MOST UNDER STAFFED COUNTIES IN THE ENTIRE STATE. AND I'VE OF SOME PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS AND VERY STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE BEFORE BEING ELECTED THE ASSEMBLY WAS MAYOR OF A CITY THAT LOST ITS COURTHOUSE DUE TO A LACK OF JUDGES. SO I GOT TO SEE FIRSTHAND THE IMPACT OF THAT LACK OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE HAS ON A COMMUNITY AND I THOUGHT WE HAD A BAD THEN BUT NOW I REPRESENTS CITIES LIKE THE CITY OF NEEDLES. THAT HAS A COURTHOUSE IT'S CLOSED IT'S SITTING THERE TO BE PERFECTLY FINE THE EXCEPT FOR A LACK OF JUDGES TO STEP OUT. AND MY CONSTITUENTS NEEDLES HAVE TO TRAVEL NOW. THREE AND A HALF HOURS DEPENDING ON WEATHER DOT IT'S A CRIMINAL MATTER OR A CIVIL MATTER BUT BUT THREE THREE AND A HALF HOURS TO COURT. AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT BURDEN IS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTFUL ON THAT MY CONSTITUENTS WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD IT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE A WHOLE DAY OFF OF WORK TO ATTEND COURT. OR CAN'T AFFORD THE TRANSPORTATION SO -- IT'S IT'S REALLY A DIRE ISSUE FOR US -- HERE TO TESTIFY WITH ME ON THAT THIS MATTER IS JUDGE VANDERVEER HERE IS THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE SAME MEDINA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. THANK YOU THANK YOU I WAS HERE LAST YEAR WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT NEEDLES AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CAR IT'S A THIRTEEN HOUR BUS RIDE. IT'S THIRTEEN HOUR IN A HOT TO BE TAKING THE BUS TO VICTORVILLE AND TAKE THE BUS BACK IS A THIRTEEN HOUR DAYS TO GET TO COURT -- BUT TODAY I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT TIME -- THREE MONTHS AGO I WAS ASKED BY THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF ANOTHER COURT. HOW ARE CORD HANDLES THE WORK LOAD A LOT AND I SAID BECAUSE WE HAVE BIG CALENDARS? SO LAST FOR SOME STATISTICAL DATA TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY AND I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A SNAPSHOT. FOR FISCAL YEAR -- SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN ARE FOR JUVENILE DEPENDENCY COURTS HEAR AN AVERAGE FOR COURT DAY OF THIRTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT HEARINGS PER DAY SO THAT'S JUVENILE DEPENDENCY THIRTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT HEARINGS ARE DAY -- FOR CRIMINAL COURT IN RANCHO OR ONE OF OUR LARGE CRIMINAL COURTS THEIR HEARING FORTY FIVE POINT -- FOUR HEARINGS PER DAY FOR VICTORVILLE WHICH IS SMALLER. HERE'S CRIMINAL AND FAMILY LAW THEIR HEARING THIRTY SIX POINT. SIX ON AVERAGE HEARINGS PER DAY. AND THAT'S HOW IT'S AN EIGHT HOUR DAY US AVERAGE AND THEN THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT SOME OF OUR VERY HIGH VOLUME COURTS HANDLE SPENT THE HIGH LOW. HIGH VOLUME -- LET ME RIDE THROUGH COURT OKAY OR MISDEMEANOR DEPARTMENTS HERE AN AVERAGE OF NINETY TO ONE HUNDRED HEARINGS PER DAY. OUR PHONE THE PRELIMINARY HEARING DEPARTMENTS WHEN A PERSON FIRST. ARRAIGNMENT THEIR HEARING FORTY TO FIFTY HEARINGS PER DAY -- SOLVE IT'S NOT JUST DISTANCE IT'S TIME. SO MANY CASES WE TRY TO GET THROUGH THE DAY AND WE GET THROUGH THE DAY. THE IMPACT OF ALL THE COURTS OPEN EVERY DAY FIVE DAYS A WEEK FIVE DAYS A WEEK -- EIGHT THIRTY WE START COUNTER CALLS AND WE TRY TO FINISH AT FOUR THIRTY SO THE CLERK HAS TIME TO FINISH THE ELDERS. AND THAT'S JUST THE SNAPSHOT WE SENT ALL THE STATISTICAL DATA THE FAMILY MEMBERS OBERNOLTE IS OFFICE IF YOU LIKE IT WE CAN SURE HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU BUT THAT'S JUST A TASTE A LITTLE SNAPSHOT OF THE VOLUME THAT WE DEAL WITH WHEN YOU'RE. A JUDGE A COURT THAT. AS OPPOSED TO HAVE THIRTY EIGHT MORE JUDGES ACCORDING THE WORKLOAD STUDY NEED SOME WHAT WE CURRENTLY THAN WHAT WE HAVE. OKAY. SO THIS FUNDING REQUEST WOULD FUND. TWENTY FIVE OF THOSE PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED POSITIONS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ESTIMATES THAT. THE CURRENT SHORTAGE OF JUDGES CALIFORNIA IT CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE IS OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE SO TWENTY FIVE IS JUST A DROP IN THE BUCKET JUST TO BE CLEAR EVEN THOUGH. THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR THE CAUCUS. WERE NOT DIRECTING THOSE JUDGES TO BE JUST FOR OUR COURTS WE WOULD GIVE THEM TO THE GENERAL COUNSEL AT THEM ALLOCATE THEM AND TRUST THAT SOME OF THOSE JUDGES WOULD COME TO US AND SOMEONE. COME TO OTHER NEEDY PORTIONS OF OF THE STATE BUT I WOULD HOPE YOU AGREE THAT ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF STATE GOVERNMENT IS TO ENSURE THAT ACCESS TO JUSTICE. AND I THINK WE'RE FAILING IN THAT DUTY TO SOME OF THESE CONSTITUENTS SO I'D DIE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THAT -- I THINK A VERY MODEST BUDGET REQUEST OKAY. OKAY WELL THANK YOU I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IT IS -- IF YOU WANT TO SHARE THE DATA YOU CAN BUT I KNOW WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OKAY TH MINISTRY WHAT IT'S THAT'S BEEN ON FOR A WHILE. AND AND CLEARLY THE THE TRANCE THE JUST TRAVELING TO COURTS AS A WAS A MAJOR ISSUE WE OPEN SOME ADDITIONAL ONES BUT EVEN THEN -- WE ARE NOT AT A PLACE I THINK PERSONALLY WHERE WHERE WE CAN TRULY SAY THAT WITH EVERYONE HAS EQUAL ACCESS. TO JUSTICE -- BUT EVEN THOSE JUST. THE FACT WE SHUT DOWN EVEN IN SAN DIEGO SO MANY BY NIGHT COURT. SO THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR JOBS JUST TO DEAL WITH TRAFFIC TICKETS OR WHATEVER MAY BE -- YOU KNOW IS REALLY UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE MOST FOLKS MANY FOLKS WERE IN THAT SITUATION BUT THEY HAVEN'T PAID THE TICKETS AND THEY'RE CAUGHT IN IT. THAT'S THAT CYCLE CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE OFF FROM WORK -- TO GO TO COURT AND SO IT IS -- WE'RE IN A PRETTY SAD STATE BECAUSE THAT YOU KNOW IF IT'S NOT ACCESSIBLE THEN IT IS JUSTICE DENIED. AND PEOPLE OFTEN MAKE DEALS ARE PLEASE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO GO TO COURT. AND A AND IT REALLY IS UNBELIEVABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE THAT FOLKS HAVE TO TRAVEL SO FAR. AND SO LONG JUST TO GET TO COURT AND WAIT SO LONG. AND JUDGES HAVE TO HANDLE THAT MANY CASES A DAY WHICH MEANS. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN HEAR. FOLKS IF YOU ACTUALLY WAITING THAT LONG SO WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO I KNOW THAT HASN'T BEEN THE LATEST REQUEST THAT WE'VE GOTTEN FOR MORE JUDGES IN WINDOW. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN OUR LIST OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND WE SHIFTED SOME FOLKS AROUND I GUESS SOME COURTS AROUND A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND BUT I KNOW WE BY NO MEANS GOT TO WHAT WE NEED TO BE. WILL LOOK AT IT APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE KEEP BRINGING IT TO ME AND MAKE ME FEEL BAD ABOUT [inaudible] WELL HOPEFULLY. WHICH WILL WORK ON IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU AND GIVE US THE DATA IF YOU CAN GIVE IT TO HIM YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME SO YOU COULD WIN HERE IN SOME CASES ON YEAH. THAT'S OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. OUR I WOULD NOT MISS RAY YES YES. HELLO HELLO HELLO. MADAM CHAIR YES HOW ARE YOU TODAY VERY GOOD I'M ALSO -- BEFORE I DO MY PRESENTATION ALSO MEMBER THE INLAND EMPIRE CAUCUS AND I WANT TO ECHO WHAT MR OBERNOLTE SAID. AND I APPRECIATE THE JUDGE VANDERVEER WAS HERE. WE DO NEED MORE JUDGES ALSO QUESTION I KNOW YOU NEED THEM THEY'RE JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED NO QUESTION NO QUESTION AND SPEAKING OF JUSTICE -- I WANT TO ADD THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME AND SPEAK TO THE COMMITTEE ON A ON THIS CONSIDERATION. THE REQUEST IS FOR ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. AND IT WOULD ESTABLISH FUNDING TO ENSURE THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OF OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN CHILD WELFARE RELATED CASES HAVE BEEN LEGAL REPRESENTATION. WHICH THEY CANNOT AFFORD. IT'S CRUCIAL TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN ARE NOT RIPPED AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. UNNECESSARILY AND WILL INCREASE CALIFORNIA'S COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL STANDARDS OUTLINED IN THE INDIAN WELFARE ACTOR IT COR. NATIONALLY THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND SIX APPEALED IT COURT CASES IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AT OF THOSE. CALIFORNIA HAD ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THE NEXT. STATE THE SECOND STATE ARE WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER WAS ALASKA WITH THE ELEVEN SO CALIFORNIA IS DEALING WITH THE MAJORITY OF THESE. ACCORDING TO THE EQUIPMENT PLANTS TASK FORCE REPORT PRESENTED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. ESTABLISHING THIS FUND WILL DRAMATICALLY DECREASE THE APPEALS CALIFORNIA HAS RELATING TO IT QUIRK AND TRIBAL CHILD WELFARE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WILL PROTECT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. FROM UNNECESSARY HARM AND TRAUMA. I GREATLY APPRECIATE THE TIME TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT TO YOU I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE -- DALY A SHARP WHO WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN THIS REGARD. HELLO I'M WITH A CALIFORNIA TRAVEL FAMILIES COALITION WHICH IS THE SUCCESSOR ORGANIZATION TO THE CALIFORNIA COMPLIANCE TASK FORCE I'M THAT PUT TOGETHER THE REPORT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE I'M. BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND I HAVE TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN JUVENILE DEPENDENCY CASES CURRENTLY IS THAT THE COUNTIES REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY. AND THE MINOR IS REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY AND EACH OF THE PARENTS ARE REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY. BUT THE TRIBE IS OFTEN REPRESENTED BY A SOCIAL WORKER THE OFTEN THE ONLY SOCIAL WORKER THAT WORKS FOR THE TRIBE THAT IS WEARING THE HAT OF THE SOCIAL WORKER ON THE GROUND. RECEIVING REFERRALS OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT INVESTIGATING THOSE REFERRALS PROVIDING SERVICES AND THEN HAVING TO ACT AS ESSENTIALLY A LAY ATTORNEY IN THE COURT ROOM. I'M BECAUSE OF THAT IN LARGE PART I'M WHAT WE HEARD FROM TRIBES ACROSS THE STATE WHEN WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER THE TASK FORCE REPORT I'M WAS THAT WE WILL NEVER SEE COMPLIANCE WITH THE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT. AS LONG AS JUDGES AREN'T ABLE TO HEAR IN COURT THE WAY THE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT IS SUPPOSED TO OPERATE AND I JUST AM WHAT TO READ TO YOU BRIEFLY A QUOTE FROM THE JUVENILE COURT JUDGES. OF CALIFORNIA -- THAT WAS PROVIDED IN ONE OF THEIR SUPPORT LETTER SO YOU HAVEN'T SOLVED. ONLY READ A A SHORT PORTION OF IT BUT AND IT SAYS ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES IN EQUITY CASES HAS BEEN THE FAILURE OF TRIBES TO BE REPRESENTED. THE REASON IS SIMPLE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE AN ATTORNEY PRESENT AT THE HEARING TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE TRIBE. THE RESULT IS THE INTEREST OF THE TRIBE OR NOT PRESENTED OR ARGUED FORCEFULLY AND THE JUDGES DENIED INFORMATION THAT WOULD MAKE HIS OR HER DECISION MORE ACCURATE AND COMPLIANCE WITH EC WHAT. THE JUDGES BELIEVE THAT THE BILL WILL ENSURE HIGH QUALITY LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR THE TRIBE. AND THAT APPELLATE COURTS WOULD HAVE THE BENEFIT OF TRAINS COUNCIL SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE TRIBE. OUR JUDGES WILL BE BETTER JUDGES WITH THE PRESENCE OF THESE ATTORNEYS I'M AND WHEN WE WERE PUTTING TOGETHER THE TASK FORCE REPORT ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT WE WERE MAKING TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AT THE TIME AND AND NOW TO YOU. I'M IS THAT WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THE FUNDING FOR THIS WOULD BE OFFSET BY THE MONEY THAT CALIFORNIA'S SPENDING -- WITH THE TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF APPEALS THAT WE'RE SEEING OF COURSE IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDING YOU KNOW THE APPEALS CREATE TREMENDOUS TRAUMA IN THE LIVES OF AN INDIAN CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES -- BUT JUST IN TERMS OF OFFENDING BECAUSE WE'RE HERE AT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. I WE DO BELIEVE THAT OVER TIME -- THE THE THE THE FUNDING WOULD BALANCE OUT. THANK YOU YOU MAY THIS REPORT THE TWO ARE AG. I'M YES THIS WAS ON A REPORT -- ATTORNEY GENERAL HARRIS BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN INVITED THE INVITATION OF A TASK FORCE TO LOOK AT COMPLIANCE WITH THE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT. AND THE CONCLUSION OF THAT TASK FORCE WAS A REPORT THAT WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED PAGES WITH TWENTY TARGETED REPRESENT. TWENTY TARGETED RECOMMENDATIONS TO ATTORNEY GENERAL THE SERRA IN MARCH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN I HAVE A COPY OF THE REPORT IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO PROVIDE IT. UNTIL THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL ABSENT SO YOU'VE IS SO MISTER MISTER SERRA HAS THIS REQUEST YES OKAY. AND I DON'T THINK HE'S NECESSARY IT COMMUNICATED THAT TO US BUT WE CAN CHECK ON IT. OKAY I BELIEVE THAT HAS OFFICE SUPPORTED THIS BILL LAST YEAR WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT A. B. -- THIRTY SEVENTY SIX BUT THE NATURE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SEEMS TO BE THAT THEY SUBMIT LETTERS OF REPORT RATHER LATE IN THE PROCESS OF THAT CAME ON THE SENATE SIDE. SO AB THIRTY SEVENTY SIX IS PASSED IN THE ASSEMBLY. SO THAT WAS THE LAST YEAR WE BROUGHT THE SAME BELL UNFORTUNATELY -- WE GOT STUCK IN A SENATE APPROPRIATIONS AND THAT'S WHY WE NEVER SAW OKAY OKAY YEAH. AND THERE'S A BILL THIS YEAR YES. YES IT AB [inaudible] SIX EIGHT FIVE ALL RIGHT. AND WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND REQUEST THAT HE SENT HIS LETTER SUPPORT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER OKAY ABSOLUTELY. ALL RIGHT SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU IN OUT IS ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WANTS. TO THINK THEY'RE ALL FINE OKAY. ANY OTHER MEMBER PRESENT TO WHO WANTED TO PRESENT THEIR RECOMMENDATION I THINK. WE'VE DONE THEM ALL MY MEMORY IF IT LOOKS LIKE. OKAY.
