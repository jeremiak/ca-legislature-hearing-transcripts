PREVIOUSLY.

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:43.650

ABOVE THIS COMMUNITY.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.187

EXPECTATION A OF SELF A RAIN

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:53.793
CELLS.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.262
SPENT FIVE MINUTES OVER THE HILL

IN FIVE MINUTES.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.070

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.739
MOUNTAIN CAME DOWN.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:09.008
THERE WERE BOULDERS OF IMMENSE

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:11.177

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:16.749
A THIRTY MILE AN HOUR RIVER.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:19.419
IT HAD BEEN CREATED.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:20.887
AND WE LOST.

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:21.954

PLAN TO PASS [inaudible]

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.729
CHILDREN.

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:32.632
I IT HAS BEEN A TRAUMATIC

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:33.933
EXPERIENCE THAT.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.668
LIVES WITH US ON A DAILY BASIS

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:37.236
IN FACT JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:39.605
WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRST RAIN OF

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:40.940
THE YEAR I WAS TALKING.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.241
TO SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS WHO

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:43.543
ADMITTED THAT THEY HEARD THE

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:45.078
RAIN STARTED TWO O'CLOCK IN THE

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:46.512
MORNING.

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:48.815
AND THEY COULD GO BACK TO SLEEP.

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:51.918
THIS KIND OF TRAUMA CONTINUES.

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:53.286
NACHOS FOR THE PEOPLE OF MY

00:05:53.352 --> 00:05:54.554
DISTRICT.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.056
BUT A FEW MONTHS PRIOR TO THE

00:05:57.123 --> 00:05:58.791
THOMAS FIRE WE HAD THE FIRES IN

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.860
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:02.528
WHICH KILLED OVER FORTY PEOPLE.

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:05.798
SINCE THEN WE HAD THE CAMPFIRE

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:08.534
AND THE WHEELS HE FIRE.

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:10.002
SO IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT.

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:11.204
THERE ARE VERY FEW OF US WHO

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.572
HAVE NOT BEEN PERSONALLY

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:13.840
IMPACTED.

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:15.308
BY THESE FIRES.

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:17.143
AND I WOULD JUST ASK US TO TAKE

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.578
A MOMENT TO REFLECT.

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:20.613
ON THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.215
THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT AND

00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:24.751
THROUGHOUT OUR BELOVED STATE.

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:26.185
AND THANK OF AN BROWN AND

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:29.188

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:31.591
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE.

00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:33.059
BEEN DEALING WITH NATURE.

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:35.862
AT CASTING HER FURY UPON US.

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:37.396
AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE STILL

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:39.632
VERY MUCH AT RISK IN ALL PARTS

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:40.733
OF THE STATE.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.535
IN AREAS WHERE THERE HAD BEEN

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:44.604
THESE SEVERE BURNS ARE STILL

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.239
POTENTIALLY SUBJECT. TO

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:48.875
MUDSLIDES AND DEBRIS FLOWS.

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:49.842
YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN THROUGH

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.211
YEARS OF DROUGHT.

00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:53.813
WE ARE NOW SEEING A LOT OF RAIN.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.215
RAIN CAN BE AS MISCHIEVOUS.

00:06:56.282 --> 00:06:57.717
AS FIRES.

00:06:57.784 --> 00:07:01.120
AND CERTAINLY AFTER THOSE FIRES

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:02.989
PROTECTS THESE HILLSIDES AND THE

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:04.991
BEAUTIFUL AREAS IN WHICH WE WE

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:07.326
LIVE BECAUSE THIS IS CALIFORNIA

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:09.128
THERE IS NO PLACE MORE BEAUTIFUL.

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:10.897
BUT WE ARE REALIZING THAT THERE

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:12.298
IS ALSO.

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:13.666
NO PLACE RIGHT NOW THAT COULD BE

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:15.168
MORE DANGEROUS AND SO I WOULD

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:18.171
ASK US ALL TO JUST REMEMBER.

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:20.139
MY TWENTY THREE CONSTITUENTS AND

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:21.107
FRIENDS.

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:22.308
THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN THE

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:24.677
THOUSANDS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:26.179
HOMES IN WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN.

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:27.814

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.382
THE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAS OCCURRED

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:31.884
AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO KERR.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.420
OCCUR AND THAT WE ALL WE COMMIT

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:36.155
TO DOING WHAT WE CAN TO PROTECT.

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:38.291

AS A ROOKIE IN [inaudible]

00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:03.648
POLITICS.

00:33:03.715 --> 00:33:06.718
A BARBER HAD A UNIQUE ABILITY TO

00:33:06.784 --> 00:33:07.852

00:33:16.427 --> 00:33:18.196
FEARS KIND OF LOVE THAT POLITICS

00:33:18.262 --> 00:33:20.565

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:33.378
THAT.

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:36.481
BECAUSE SHE WAS ON A MISSION.

00:33:36.547 --> 00:33:37.648
AND SHE WAS ON A MISSION FOR

00:33:37.715 --> 00:33:39.917

00:34:08.413 --> 00:34:09.414

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.817
THAT WAS HER FOR THE REST OF HER.

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:16.187
WAS MATCH MAKING IN MARRIAGES.

00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:18.089
WAS FINDING WAYS TO CONNECT.

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:20.892
DOCTORS WHO WERE IMMIGRANTS TO

IN THE COMMUNITY WHEN SHE BEFORE

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:49.447
SHE PASSED HAD A SERIOUS

00:35:49.514 --> 00:35:50.448
ACCIDENT BECAUSE SHE WAS

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:52.350
STRIPPED ON A STEP IF YOU WANT

00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:53.251

00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:53.818
OF THEM.

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:55.653

SHE BRING GIFTS TO AND SHE WOULD

00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:02.460
CALL THE GIFTS NOT BECAUSE THEY

HOLIDAYS.

00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:05.496
SHE CALLED IN JUST BECAUSE GIFTS
