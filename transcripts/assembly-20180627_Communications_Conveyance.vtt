TO SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE

00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:28.613
A FIXED COST THAT WILL SPIKE.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.447
DEPENDING ON THE DEMAND THAT

00:32:29.514 --> 00:32:31.582
YOU'RE DRAWING AT ANY ONE POINT

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:32.817
IN TIME.

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:34.552
OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:36.120
COST OF PROVIDING.

00:32:36.187 --> 00:32:37.655
BELOW MARKET RATE ELECTRICITY

00:32:37.722 --> 00:32:38.756
TRANSIT AUTHORITIES WILL BE

00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:42.026
BAKED INTO A TIME OF USED COSTS

00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:43.961
FOR COMPANIES THAT WOULD BE ONE

00:32:44.028 --> 00:32:45.063
ONE ONE STRATEGY THAT COULD BE

00:32:45.129 --> 00:32:45.963
USED --

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.532
WITHIN WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK

00:32:47.598 --> 00:32:49.467
WOULD THAT NOT BE A VIOLATION OF

00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:50.802
THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT

00:32:50.868 --> 00:32:52.103
SAYS THAT IN THE WOULD THAT BE A

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.571
COST SHIFT THAT WOULD BE A NON

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:54.205
PARTICIPATING CUSTODY WOULD BE A

00:32:54.272 --> 00:32:55.206
CHANGE.

00:32:55.273 --> 00:32:56.541
IN THE WAY THAT COSTS ARE

00:32:56.607 --> 00:32:58.276
ALLOCATED BUT THEY WOULD BE BORN

00:32:58.343 --> 00:33:01.779
FULLY BY THE TRANSIT AGENCY.

00:33:01.846 --> 00:33:02.714
I THINK WE'RE PROUD OF NOW NOW

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.882
I'M REALLY CONFUSED GO IT'S I

00:33:04.949 --> 00:33:06.451
THINK THAT THE COMMITMENT IS IS

00:33:06.517 --> 00:33:07.385
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO COST

00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:08.820
SHIP THAT WE ARE GOING TO FIND A

00:33:08.886 --> 00:33:10.555
WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PAY FOR

00:33:10.621 --> 00:33:11.889
IT BUT WE'RE NOT SHIFTING IT TO

00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:12.256
THOSE WHO MIGHT.

00:33:12.323 --> 00:33:13.991
BE USING IT.

00:33:14.058 --> 00:33:14.926
I DON'T THINK I HAVE A COMPLETE

00:33:14.992 --> 00:33:16.027
ANSWER FOR IS WHAT I'M SAYING Y.

00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:17.795
AND I'M I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC

00:33:17.862 --> 00:33:18.529
BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THE

00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:19.497
COMMITTEES.

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:20.998
ARE IS IS --

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.633
FOISTING ON YOU RIGHT SO I

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.935
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU THAT YOU

00:33:24.001 --> 00:33:24.769
KNOW THAT THIS CAME FROM A

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:26.237
COMMITTEE AND NOT FROM THE

00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:28.573
AUTHOR BUT IT IT PUTS ME IN A

00:33:28.639 --> 00:33:30.208
DILEMMA BECAUSE MY BIG PROBLEM

00:33:30.274 --> 00:33:31.376
WITH YOUR BILL.

00:33:31.442 --> 00:33:31.809
IS THAT [inaudible]

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:34.212
HA.

00:33:34.278 --> 00:33:35.713
ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY RATES

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.482
ARE ALREADY IN CALIFORNIA OVER

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:38.516
50% HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:39.250
AVERAGE.

00:33:39.317 --> 00:33:41.753
AND I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING

00:33:41.819 --> 00:33:43.921
THAT'S GOING TO FURTHER INCREASE

00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:44.756
THAT GAP BECAUSE I THINK IT

00:33:44.822 --> 00:33:46.324
MAKES LIVING IN CALIFORNIA EVEN

00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:47.625
LESS AFFORDABLE AND A LOT OF

00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:49.127
PEOPLE I REPRESENT ARE ALREADY

00:33:49.193 --> 00:33:49.861
STRUGGLING SO.

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:52.363
A IT'S IT'S REFRESHING TO SEE

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.197
SOMETHING THAT SAYS THERE WILL

00:33:53.264 --> 00:33:55.266
BE NO COST SHIFT BUT TO ME

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:56.567
THAT'S AN IMPOSSIBILITY BECAUSE

00:33:56.634 --> 00:33:57.935
THE ELECTION THE UTILITY HAS TO

00:33:58.002 --> 00:33:59.303
RECOVER ITS COSTS BEFORE

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:00.271
MANDATING.

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:01.372
THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING A LOOK

00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:01.939
BELOW MARK ELECTRICITY THAT

00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:04.675
MONEY YOU KNOW WE COULD

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:06.144
LEGISLATE THAT A COFFEE CUPS NOT

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.545
A COFFEE CUP BUT YOU KNOW AT THE

00:34:07.612 --> 00:34:08.780
END OF THE DAY IT'S GOT TO BE A

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:09.714
COFFEE CUP AT THE END OF THE

00:34:09.781 --> 00:34:10.314
YEAR.

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:11.582
AYE I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW

00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:13.684
THERE CAN'T BE SOME KIND OF COST

00:34:13.751 --> 00:34:15.520
SHIFT TO RECOVER THOSE FUNDS.

00:34:15.586 --> 00:34:17.488
WELL I AM EVER HOPEFUL THAT WE

00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:19.123
CAN ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO DO

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.425
EXACTLY WHAT WE SAID WE WOULD DO

00:34:20.491 --> 00:34:21.259
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:22.894
AMENDMENTS THAT SAY THAT WE'RE

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.530
NOT GOING TO COST* KASHIF

00:34:25.596 --> 00:34:26.130
THAT WE'RE GOING HAVE TO FIND

00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:26.564
WOULD NOT DO THAT.

00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:27.765
WELL WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY IT

00:34:27.832 --> 00:34:29.500
EITHER BAKE IT IN OR SOME OTHER

00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:31.436
MECHANISM OKAY WELL.

00:34:31.502 --> 00:34:32.537
RESPECTFULLY PACOLLI ONLY SEE

00:34:32.603 --> 00:34:34.172
TWO TWO POSSIBILITIES EITHER A

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:36.307
CUSTOMER PAYS OR THE UTILITY

00:34:36.374 --> 00:34:36.874
PAYS [inaudible]

00:34:36.941 --> 00:34:40.111
AND THE THE ALL OF THE OTHER

00:34:40.178 --> 00:34:41.279
THAN THAT IT'S THERE'S THERE'S

00:34:41.345 --> 00:34:42.713
GOTTA COME FROM SOMEWHERE AND I

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.181
I THINK I WOULD JUST

00:34:43.247 --> 00:34:44.715
RESPECTFULLY SAY THAT WE HAVE TO

00:34:44.782 --> 00:34:45.583
DO SOMETHING.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.385
IF WE CONTINUE DOWN THE PATH

00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:48.786
WHERE YOU LIVE JUST AT OUTSIDE

00:34:48.853 --> 00:34:49.620
YOUR DISTRICTS JUST ATTACHED TO

00:34:49.687 --> 00:34:51.155
MINE AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE

00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:52.523
SOME OF THE WORST POLLUTION IN

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.292
THE INLAND EMPIRE THAN ANYWHERE.

00:34:54.358 --> 00:34:55.693
IF WE DON'T FIND A WAY TO MAKE

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.594
IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THESE

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:58.763
BUSES TO OPERATE ELECTRICALLY

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.164
THEN WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO

00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:01.933
POLLUTE THE AREAS OF BOTH YOU

00:35:01.999 --> 00:35:02.567
AND I LIVE IN.

00:35:02.633 --> 00:35:04.735
AND MARK ARE A CONSTITUENTS LIVE

00:35:04.802 --> 00:35:05.570
AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:07.305
BIGGEST OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF

00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:09.340
ASTHMA IN THE INLAND EMPIRE THAN

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:10.408
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE OF

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:11.175
CALIFORNIA.

00:35:11.242 --> 00:35:13.110
WILSON OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS

00:35:13.177 --> 00:35:15.179
EXTREMELY HIGH RATES SO I WOULD

00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:15.813
JUST SAY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.615
FIGURE THIS OUT SO THAT WE CAN

00:35:17.682 --> 00:35:18.916
DO THE BEST WE CAN SURE A AND I

00:35:18.983 --> 00:35:20.218
THINK WE ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT

00:35:20.284 --> 00:35:21.285
THAT WE WANT.

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:23.020
TO INCENTIVIZE THE PRODUCTION OF

00:35:23.087 --> 00:35:24.655
MORE TRANSIT THAT ZERO MISSION

00:35:24.722 --> 00:35:26.457
BUT JUST A QUESTION OF HOW WE

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:28.025
GET THERE THAT WE'RE DEBATING

00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:28.559
TODAY ALWAYS THE QUESTION

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:28.860
[inaudible]

00:35:28.926 --> 00:35:29.961
MR MATHIS.

00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:31.762
I I'M GONNA FIGURE SOME OF THE

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:32.663
VICE CHAIRMAN'S CONCERNS HERE

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.532

ASTHMA PROBLEM HE'S AIR QUALITY

BROUGHT AND GREEN BOSTON IS

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:46.711
DOING ELECTRIC BUTTON AND

00:35:46.777 --> 00:35:48.779
FIGURED OUT A WAY.

00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:50.848
THEIR BUT WHEN WE USE

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:54.552
TERMINOLOGY LIKE BAY CAN --

TO ME THAT'S JUST.

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:58.723
SCREAMING THAT IT'S GONNA COST

00:35:58.789 --> 00:36:00.625
SHIFT TO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

00:36:00.691 --> 00:36:02.493

LIVING IN POVERTY A ANY THEIR

00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:26.217
CONCERN IS MORE SO KEEP IT COOL

IN OTHER INNER WEARING THEIR

00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:32.723
WORD ABOUT THE AIR BUT MEMORY

ABOUT TAKING CARE THEIR FAMILY.

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:35.660
BY IN THE LATE GREAT ANYTHING

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:36.761
THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE A COST

00:36:36.827 --> 00:36:39.030
SHIFT IS IS.

00:36:39.096 --> 00:36:40.531
WORRISOME --

GOT YOUR VOTES TO DO IT --

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:48.806
MAYBE LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT

00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:50.808
WOULD INCENTIVIZE.

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:52.543
THE COMPANY'S SAN AND GIVE THEM

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.045
SOME KIND OF A TAX BREAK OR

00:36:54.111 --> 00:36:56.347
SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES --

00:36:56.414 --> 00:36:57.815
WHAT WERE THEY GOING TO CREDIT

00:36:57.882 --> 00:37:00.518
BACK FOR DOING THIS SO INSTEAD

00:37:00.585 --> 00:37:02.920
OF SHIFTING THE COSTS OF THE ONE

00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:04.288
WHO I DON'T WILL MARKET SHIP WE

00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:04.989
WE CAN?

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:05.890
POSSIBLY GIVE THESE COMPANIES A

00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:08.392

TECHNOLOGICALLY.

00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:13.698
VERSE SAYS POSSIBLY HURTING THE

00:37:13.764 --> 00:37:14.565

BE CLEAR AGAIN WE ARE NOT

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:18.502
LOOKING TO COST SHIFT I THINK

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:19.870
THAT'S WHY THAT MY AMENDMENT WAS

00:37:19.937 --> 00:37:21.339
PUT INTO THE BILL.

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:22.607
AND IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO

00:37:22.673 --> 00:37:24.108
LOOK OF INCENTIVE INCENTIVES ARE

00:37:24.175 --> 00:37:25.376
BETTER THE CARE IS BETTER THAN

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:27.211
