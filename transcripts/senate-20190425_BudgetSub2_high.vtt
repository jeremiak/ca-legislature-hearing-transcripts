00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:13.032
WE LOOKED AT THE HOURLY FEES

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:14.967
THAT THE COUNCIL IS PROPOSING

00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:25.511
COMPARABLE.

COMMISSION'S CURRENT LEGAL STAFF

00:12:56.775 --> 00:12:59.078
WE THOUGHT -- THE NEED TO HIRE

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:19.198
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ASKED THE MAN

00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:20.699

THERE'S LESS FUNDING REQUIRED --

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:34.580
IT WILL BE USED FOR ANYTHING

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.049

ADMINISTRATION'S COUNCIL TO

00:16:04.963 --> 00:16:05.964

OF THIS IT'S GOING TO BE

00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:20.212
IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE.

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:22.514
ALL SPEAKING WITH ONE VOICE.

00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:23.382
I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK IT'S

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:24.750
IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE ALL

SPEAKING WITH ONE VOICE -- I

00:16:26.418 --> 00:16:28.587
CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE

00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:30.089
ADMINISTRATION AS A WHOLE OR THE

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:33.092
GOVERNOR BUT MY MY TAKE IS THAT

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:34.827
THE GOVERNOR IS HANDLING

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:36.295
STATEWIDE ISSUES.

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:37.696
THAT ARE BROADER AND MORE

00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:41.200
COMPLEX THAN THE ISSUES OF THE

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:42.968

00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:44.670
OF THE PUZZLE.

AND SO OUR COUNCIL WILL BE

00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:47.539

00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:51.009
TO COORDINATE WITH THE STATE AS

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:52.378
A WHOLE WHICH I THINK IS

00:16:52.444 --> 00:16:54.113
GRAPPLING WITH A A BIGGER

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.080
PROBLEM.

00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:57.116
PUSHING BACK ON THAT A BIT.

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:58.117
THE SETTLEMENT IMPACTS THE

00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:01.720
ENTIRE STATE.

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:04.223
SO THE GOVERNOR AND I CAN'T

00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:06.024
SPEAK FOR HIM AND I LOVE TO HEAR

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:07.459
FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:12.297

THE DECISION CERTAINLY MADE YOU

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.140
SEE IS GOING TO BE A STATEWIDE

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:22.441
SIGNIFICANCE.

00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:23.542
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE IN THE

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.244

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:25.744
TECHNICAL MATTERS OF THE

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:26.912
BANKRUPTCY.

00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:28.647
AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE A

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:30.616
COORDINATED EFFORT IS GOING TO

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:32.017

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:40.205
GET INVOLVED IN DISCUSSIONS.

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:41.473
ON HOW THE PLAN IS STRUCTURED

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.941
HOW IT'S CONCEPTUALIZE WITH THE

00:20:43.008 --> 00:20:44.576
BASIC ELEMENTS OF THE PLATTER.

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:46.011
AS IT GETS FLUSHED OUT.

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:49.047
WE WILL NEED TO RELY ON OUR

00:20:49.114 --> 00:20:50.849
FINANCIAL ADVISER.

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:54.453
AND ON OUR COUNCIL. TO DETERMINE

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:55.621
HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK WITH THE

00:20:55.687 --> 00:20:58.323
REPAIR PACKS WILL BE.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.192
AND AT THE END WE WILL NEED TO

00:21:00.258 --> 00:21:03.261
DECIDE WHETHER WE AS AN AGENCY

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:05.297
WANT TO APPROVE BY THE PLANET

00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:06.465
ELEMENTS TO PLAN THEIR WITHIN

00:21:06.531 --> 00:21:11.303
OUR JURISDICTION.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:12.304
WHERE'S THE BOOK OF THE WORKING

00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:13.972
TO BE IS IT.

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:17.042
IS IT A IS IT A RIGHT NOW.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:19.044
THING OR IS THIS THAT'S A REALLY

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.346
GOOD QUESTION OKAY -- I'VE

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:22.948
BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS ARE LUMPY

00:21:23.015 --> 00:21:25.417
WORK HAPPENS IN REALLY BIG

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:27.486
CHUNKS.

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:28.687
AT TIMES THAT ARE UNPREDICTABLE.

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:30.856
I MEAN IF THERE'S A QUICK EXIT

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:32.257
THEN THE BULK OF THE WORK I

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:33.725
GOING TO START TOMORROW IF

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:34.993
THERE'S A SLOW EXIT.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.361
I THINK THE BULK OF THE WORK

00:21:36.428 --> 00:21:39.631
WILL START ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW --

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:41.400
SO IT'S IT'S VERY UNPREDICTABLE

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:42.901
THAT'S PROBABLY ARE ASKING FOR

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:44.302
THE MONEY FOR THREE YEARS.

00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:45.871
SO THAT IT'S THERE WHEN IT'S

00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:48.306
NEEDED -- AND AT THIS POINT IT'S

00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:49.741
RELATIVELY EARLY DAYS IN THE

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:51.076
BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING SO WE

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:53.945
CAN'T PREDICT HOW IT'S GONNA GO.

00:21:54.012 --> 00:21:55.380
REMIND ME AGAIN WHO WHO IS THE

00:21:55.447 --> 00:21:57.749
OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL IT'S A

00:21:57.816 --> 00:21:58.550
LITTLE CANCELS THE PAUL WEISS

00:22:02.354 --> 00:22:04.756
RIGHT I MEAN THEY STARTED IN

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:06.058
TWENTY SIXTEEN TO MY KNOWLEDGE --

00:22:06.124 --> 00:22:09.194
IS THAT I AM SPEAKING FROM WHAT

00:22:09.261 --> 00:22:11.363
I HAVE READ ON THE WEBSITE AND

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.997
AND I BELIEVE SOMETHING I READ

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:13.065
THE WALLSTREET JOURNAL.

00:22:13.131 --> 00:22:15.300

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:28.180
CORRECT.

00:22:28.246 --> 00:22:29.648
I THOUGHT THEY HAD LEFT A BIG A

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:31.316
BOUTIQUE INVESTMENT FIRM WHICH

00:22:35.887 --> 00:22:37.155
OVEN AND THEN.

00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:38.356
THE POP IN YOUR POLL WISE

00:22:38.423 --> 00:22:39.558

00:22:40.826 --> 00:22:41.293
OKAY.

00:22:41.359 --> 00:22:43.028
AT BUT SO THE WOULD YOU SAY

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:45.263
RIGHT NOW IS A MORE FINANCIAL.

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.299
PHASE AND AND THAT LATER IS

00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:48.967
GOING TO BE MORE LEGAL IS THAT

00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:50.068
NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT

00:22:50.135 --> 00:22:51.269
IT ONE THING WE'VE BEEN

00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:54.439
STRUGGLING WITH IS THE LACK OF

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:56.041
OF MATH FRANKLY THAT WE'RE

00:22:56.108 --> 00:22:57.776
GETTING IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY

00:22:57.843 --> 00:22:59.077
TO CHECK WHAT THE MARKETS ARE

00:22:59.144 --> 00:22:59.778
TELLING US.

00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:02.447
WE GET THERE'S A LOT OF ADVOCACY

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:05.517
GOING ON A LOT OF THINGS -- CAST

00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:07.185
ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU HEAR NUMBERS

00:23:07.252 --> 00:23:10.355
COMING OUT OF ELLIOTT MANAGEMENT.

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:11.957
THE GENIE WILL THEN COME UP WITH

00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:15.227
pTHINGS COMING FROM OTHER EQUITY

00:23:15.293 --> 00:23:16.328
AND DEBT HOLDERS.

00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:18.430
DO YOU ANTICIPATE ON THE

00:23:18.497 --> 00:23:21.333
FINANCIAL SIDE -- ANY SORT OF

00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:22.868
MORE PUBLIC FACING OR AT LEAST

00:23:22.934 --> 00:23:24.636
LEGISLATIVELY FACING INTERFACE

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:27.105
FOR WE CAN GET A SENSE OF HOW.

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:29.040
TO RIGHT SIZE RELEASED ANALYZE

00:23:29.107 --> 00:23:29.641
SOME OF THE INFORMATION E'RE

00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:31.143
GETTING BACK OR IS THAT SORT OF

00:23:31.209 --> 00:23:32.477
BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WHAT YOU'RE

00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:34.112
ANTICIPATING USING THE SERVICES

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:35.046
I MEAN TO THE EXTENT THAT THE P.

00:23:35.113 --> 00:23:36.948
UC STAFF UNDERSTAND THE

00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:38.683
SITUATION OF FINANCIAL MARKETS I

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.018
THINK WOULD BE HAPPY.

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:42.521
TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW BRIEF

00:23:42.587 --> 00:23:45.524
LEGISLATORS -- WE ARE GOING I

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.025
MEAN PART OF THE PURPOSE OF

HAVING A FINANCIAL ANALYST ON

00:23:48.493 --> 00:23:50.896
BOARD IS TO MONITOR WHAT'S GOING

00:23:50.962 --> 00:23:52.330
ON IN THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY.

00:23:52.397 --> 00:23:53.932
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:55.801
ARE SAYING WHETHER PROPOSALS

00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:57.936
MAKES SENSE WHETHER THEY DON'T.

00:23:58.003 --> 00:23:58.470
WHAT WHAT THEIR EFFECT ON

00:23:58.537 --> 00:23:59.604
REPAIRS MIGHT BE?

00:23:59.671 --> 00:24:01.239
AND I DO HAVE LIMITATIONS ON

00:24:01.306 --> 00:24:03.074
YOUR ABILITY TO TO INTERFACE

00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:04.943
WITH US ON THAT.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:05.977
I MEAN IS THERE IS THERE SOME

00:24:06.044 --> 00:24:07.345
PRIVILEGE THAT YOU'RE NOT

00:24:07.412 --> 00:24:08.880

US AND ALLOWED TO SHARE OTHERS

00:24:10.415 --> 00:24:12.417
OR I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT THAT

00:24:12.484 --> 00:24:14.019
THROUGH I MEAN MAY KNOW WE HAVE

00:24:14.085 --> 00:24:18.390
PRETTY -- LIBERAL -- AS RULES IN

00:24:18.456 --> 00:24:19.825
TERMS OF THE INTERFACE WITH THE

00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:20.826
LEGISLATURE IN WHICH YOU'RE JUST

00:24:20.892 --> 00:24:22.093
HEARING TODAY IS.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.030
LET'S LET'S MAXIMIZE THAT COME

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:27.966
THE THE FLOW THAT CONVERSATION

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:29.401
TO AT LEAST ARM US WITH THE BEST

00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:33.405

THAT I I'M I'M A LAWYER SO I'M

00:24:37.475 --> 00:24:38.043
ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT ATTORNEY

00:24:38.109 --> 00:24:38.577
CLIENT PRIDE.

YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE HOW DOES THAT

00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:41.146
LINE UP I KNOW THE EX PARTE

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:42.180
APPLIES VERY DIFFERENTLY TO

00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:43.381
CONVERSATIONS THE LEGISLATURE

00:24:43.448 --> 00:24:44.416
WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE THE SAME

00:24:44.482 --> 00:24:45.851

WITH THEIR FINANCIAL SERVICE

00:24:49.454 --> 00:24:50.355
VISOR.

JUST LOVE SOME FEEDBACK ON THAT

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.325
FIND OUT THE SCOPE AND THEN

00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:55.460
LET'S SORT OF MAXIMIZE THE FLOW

00:24:55.527 --> 00:25:00.532
THAT THE BEST YEAH LET ME THINK

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:00.832

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:01.666
THANK YOU.

00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:02.901
I THINK IT'S SAD.

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:03.835
PART OF THE WORK OUT IS GOING TO

00:25:03.902 --> 00:25:05.337
BE OUTSIDE THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

00:25:05.403 --> 00:25:07.239
THAT'S GOING TO BE WHAT THE

00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:08.673
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.142
COME TOGETHER WE'VE TALKED ABOUT.

00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:12.978
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT A SECRET

00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:14.613
THAT THERE'S FUNDING IS GOING TO

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:15.981
BE AN IMPORTANT THING AND HOW

00:25:16.047 --> 00:25:18.149
THAT HOW THAT PIECE GOES IN.

00:25:18.216 --> 00:25:18.783
I BELIEVE THE DEBTOR IN

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.086
POSSESSION WILL USE THAT AS THE

00:25:21.152 --> 00:25:22.821
P. YOU SEE WILL USE THAT SO SO

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:24.923
THERE'S MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.258
THIS IS THE THIS IS THE

00:25:26.324 --> 00:25:27.392
BANKRUPTCY WORK.

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:29.394
THAT WE'RE PAYING FOR THE OTHER

00:25:29.461 --> 00:25:31.997
NORMAL LEGISLATIVE WORKER OR

00:25:32.063 --> 00:25:33.798
DATED THEY WORK THE PC DOES NOT

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:35.300
THAT THESE FOLKS WON'T TOUCH IT

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:36.868
BUT IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH THE

00:25:36.935 --> 00:25:38.536
BANKRUPTCY LANDS ON IT AND THAT

00:25:38.603 --> 00:25:39.204
WOULD BE.

00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:40.405
BASED ON WHILE IT'S A

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:42.607
COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT IT'S

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:44.542
THE DEBTOR POSSESSIONS PLAN YOU

00:25:44.609 --> 00:25:46.278

THIS IS ROUND TWO WITH THE JUDGE.

00:25:58.056 --> 00:26:00.759
SO WE I THINK WE HAVE WORKED OUT

00:26:00.825 --> 00:26:02.193
WHAT THE ROLE OF THE P. YOU SEE

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.995
IS WHAT THE ROLE OF IT IS

00:26:04.062 --> 00:26:05.931
BECAUSE THE WHOLE UNITED STATES

00:26:05.997 --> 00:26:06.331
IS LEARNED FROM.

00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:07.265

BECAUSE FOR MY COLLEAGUES THE

00:26:21.212 --> 00:26:23.114
PLAN COMES TOGETHER IS DIFFERENT

00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:24.582

ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD AT THE

00:26:43.601 --> 00:26:44.035
END.

00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:45.971
OF NOT IF THEY'RE NOT ANYMORE

00:37:36.387 --> 00:37:37.321

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.669
YES SENATOR I PERSONALLY VISITED

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:53.371
THE FRONT STREET -- BUILDING

00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:55.373
LAST WEEK I WALKED THE ENTIRE

00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:57.408
BUILDING SAW MULTIPLE SPACES

00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:59.510
THERE I SUBMITTED A THE WORK

00:37:59.577 --> 00:38:01.946
PLAN OF THE FLOOR PLAN.

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:04.815
AND OTHER DOCUMENTATION TO THE

00:38:04.882 --> 00:38:07.385
DIRECTOR OF THE CPC THIS LAST

00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:09.687
WEEK -- IT'S IT IS A SERIOUS

00:38:09.754 --> 00:38:10.554
CONSIDERATION.

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:12.523
THIS IS WHAT WILL THAT OFFICE

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.626
HAVE -- HE CAN YOU TELL ME THE

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:17.361
LEVEL OF INTERACTION IT WOULD

00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:19.664
HAVE WITH THE PUBLIC COMING TO

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.332
THAT BUILDING OR IS IT MOSTLY --

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:22.833
STATE EMPLOYEES THAT DON'T

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.604
INTERACT WITH THE PUBLIC.

00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:28.205
I WOULD CONSIDER IT A KIND OF

00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:29.840
LIKE A SATELLITE OFFICE BECAUSE

00:38:29.907 --> 00:38:31.442
IT DOESN'T HAVE OF THE FULL

00:38:31.509 --> 00:38:33.244
CAPABILITIES FOR HEARING ROOMS

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:34.111
AT THIS POINT.

00:38:34.178 --> 00:38:36.147
THERE IS A A MAJOR HEARING ROOM

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:37.815
IN THE BASEMENT THAT I TOURED

00:38:37.882 --> 00:38:40.885
BUT UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE

00:38:40.951 --> 00:38:42.219
LIMITED ABILITY TO UPGRADE THAT

00:38:42.286 --> 00:38:44.355
BUILDING -- IT'S VERY DOUBTFUL

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:46.223
WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THOSE

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.658
FACILITIES BUT I DID.

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:49.460
CERTAINLY TOUR THAT AREA AND

00:38:49.527 --> 00:38:51.929
CONSIDER IT MOST OF THE STAFF --

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:54.165
LOCATING THERE WOULD BE WORKING

00:38:54.231 --> 00:38:56.300
OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICE -- THEY

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:58.436
WOULD BE DOING THE INSPECTIONS

00:38:58.502 --> 00:39:00.905
INVESTIGATIONS -- ALE JAY'S

00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:03.174
WOULD BE THERE AND MOST LIKELY

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.575
OUR HEARINGS WE HAVE TO BE IN

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:06.343
LOS ANGELES OR SOME OTHER LEASED

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:07.478
SPACE I CAN I WANNA MAKE SHORT

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:08.345
TIME AT THE BILLING ON FRONT

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:09.180

00:39:09.246 --> 00:39:10.581
ON FRONT STREET THAT IS CLOSE TO

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:11.615
MY MY CONCERN WITH THAT BUILDING

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:14.318
IS -- IF THE PUBLIC HAS.

00:39:14.385 --> 00:39:17.621
TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE EMPLOYEES

00:39:17.688 --> 00:39:19.490
ARE THE PARKING IS -- NOT VERY

00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:20.124
GOOD THERE FOR THE PUBLIC AND I

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.125
THINK THERE'S EVEN SOME PARKING

00:39:21.192 --> 00:39:22.793
CHALLENGES FOR THE EMPLOYEES

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.394

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:26.030
PART -- I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:26.797

00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:28.332
OUT TO THE LEGISLATORS THAT ARE

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:29.533
LOCATED.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.268
IN THAT OFFICE BUILDING KIND OF

00:39:31.335 --> 00:39:32.603
GET THEIR TAKE ON THE

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.638
INTERACTION WITH THE PUBLIC --

00:39:34.705 --> 00:39:36.073
FOR THAT I HAVE IS IF THERE'S NO

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.708
PUBLIC INTERACTION AND I'M LESS

00:39:37.775 --> 00:39:39.276
CONCERNED IF THERE'S SIGNIFICANT

00:39:39.343 --> 00:39:41.545
PUBLIC INTERACTION AND I'M.

00:39:41.612 --> 00:39:42.680
THE CONCERNS HIGHER.

00:39:42.747 --> 00:39:44.148

OKAY.

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:42.807
THE ENERGY COMMISSION -- THANK

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:43.674
YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:45.709
FROM US THAT ACCOUNT THE ENERGY

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:47.878
RESOURCES PROGRAMS ACCOUNT THE

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:49.013
ACCOUNT.

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:51.649
A GENERATES FOR US -- WHAT HAS

00:40:51.715 --> 00:40:53.684
BEEN HISTORICALLY SUFFICIENT

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:54.585
FUNDS TO RUN A?

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:55.986
LARGE CHUNK OF OUR ORGANIZATION

00:40:56.053 --> 00:40:57.988
HOWEVER IT IS IN A STRUCTURAL

00:40:58.055 --> 00:41:00.057
DEFICIT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE

00:41:00.124 --> 00:41:01.492
HERE BEFORE YOU -- THIS MORNING.

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:02.993
DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES HAS BEEN

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.795
INCREASING WE'VE GOT ABOUT SEVEN

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:06.330
HUNDRED PLUS STAFF OF THE ENERGY

00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:07.331
COMMISSION.

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:09.033
OF FOUR HUNDRED PLUS OF THOSE

00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:10.334
ARE FUNDED FROM THIS ACCOUNT

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:14.004
OVER THE LAST ABOUT DECADE YOU --

00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:16.307
GRANTED A SEVENTY NEW POSITION

00:41:16.373 --> 00:41:18.042
SO IT'S GROWN CONSIDERABLY AT

00:41:18.108 --> 00:41:20.578
THE SAME TIME THE REVENUES HAVE

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:21.579
BEEN DECLINING.

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:22.947
IN IT THERE'S TWO REASONS FOR

00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:25.850
THIS THE FIRST IS THE BUYING THE

00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:26.951
METER SOLAR THAT WE'VE BEEN SO

00:41:27.017 --> 00:41:27.551
SUCCESSFUL WITH THE CALIFORNIA

00:41:27.618 --> 00:41:28.752
WE'RE UP TO ABOUT EIGHT EIGHT

00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:31.188
GIGAWATTS RIGHT NOW AND TO PUT

00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:32.556
THAT IN PERSPECTIVE THAT'S MORE.

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:34.024
THAT PRODUCES MORE ENERGY THAN

00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:35.626
THE STATE OF VERMONT CONSUMES IN

00:41:35.693 --> 00:41:37.328
ITS ENTIRETY SO WE'VE REALLY

00:41:37.394 --> 00:41:38.128
DONE WELL.

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:42.366
WHAT WOULD THAT BE IN DOLLARS SO

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:42.733
THAT WE HAVE A?

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.201
YOU KNOW IF WE IF WE WERE ABLE

00:41:44.268 --> 00:41:45.336
TO CHARGE FOR THE BEHIND THE

00:41:45.402 --> 00:41:46.470
METER AND WHICH I NOW I REALIZE

00:41:46.537 --> 00:41:49.106
THAT'S LEGISLATION SOME PEOPLE.

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:51.108
RIGHTI'LL GET EMAILS FROM IT

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:52.476
BUT BUT IT'S IT IS [inaudible]

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:57.181
A CONCERN.

00:41:57.248 --> 00:41:59.216
AMONG THE ITEMS THAT YOUR STAFF

00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:00.417
AND THE AWAY ALWAYS IDENTIFIED

00:42:00.484 --> 00:42:02.753
AS POTENTIAL AREAS TO INCREASE

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.388
REVENUES. TO TO CLOSER SHORTFALL

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:07.258
IS TO IMPOSE THIS CHARGE WHICH

00:42:07.324 --> 00:42:08.959
ISN'T CURRENTLY.

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:11.595
IMPOSED ON BY THE METER TO BUY

00:42:11.662 --> 00:42:13.197
THE METER AND TEST YOUR QUESTION

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:16.333
THE THE THE NUMBER -- IT I GUESS

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.301
YOUR QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT IF

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:19.003
WE TOOK THE CURRENT CHARGE AND

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:20.738
JUST STRAIGHT UP APPLIED THAT TO

00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:22.039
BEHIND ME -- I'D I THINK IT

00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:23.707
GENERATES.

00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:28.913
ABOUT DOING -- THREE MILLION.

00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:30.080
SO THAT WOULD IF WE JUST TOOK

00:42:30.147 --> 00:42:32.149
THE POINT ZERO ZERO THREE CHARGE

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:33.083
IT WOULD GENERATE THREE MILLION

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:34.518
MORE SO WE WOULD CLOSE THE

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:36.820
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WOULD FIX IT

00:42:36.887 --> 00:42:37.621
RIGHT.

00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:40.491
IT WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE IT --

00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:41.125
SO THANKS FOR THE QUESTION THE

00:42:41.191 --> 00:42:43.560
OTHER PIECE OF IT IS

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:44.795
CONSERVATION.

00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:46.797
AND THAT'S CHIEFLY BAN -- ENERGY

00:42:46.864 --> 00:42:48.832
EFFICIENCY AND SO AS WE REDUCE

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:50.434
THE ENERGY WE CONSUME BY

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:52.503
BECOMING MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT --

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:53.270
AND BUILDINGS INCREASINGLY ARE

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:55.773
BECOMING SO AS OUR APPLIANCES

00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:58.375
THAT -- THAT ALSO HAS HAS A A

00:42:58.442 --> 00:42:59.610
SUPPRESSING IMPACTS OF THIS IS

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:01.278
GREAT FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S GREAT

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:03.113
FOR RATEPAYERS REDUCES RATES

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.481
IT'S BUT SOME THESE ARE AMONG

00:43:04.548 --> 00:43:06.450
THE REASONS WHY OUR PER CAPITA

00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:08.419
CONSUMPTION IN CALIFORNIA'S 44%

00:43:08.485 --> 00:43:09.553
LOWER.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.088
THAN THE AVERAGE THROUGHOUT THE

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:12.890
NATION SO WE'VE DONE REALLY WELL

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:14.725
THERE BUT IT IMPACTS OUR ABILITY

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:17.227
TO RUN OUR OUR ORGANIZATION SO

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:17.828
THAT'S WHY WERE -- BEFORE YOU

00:43:17.895 --> 00:43:18.595
TODAY.

00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:19.863
OF FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.432
WE'VE BEEN SPENDING MORE THAN

00:43:21.498 --> 00:43:23.600
WE'VE -- BEEN BRINGING IN AND

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:24.401
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT

00:43:24.468 --> 00:43:25.803
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A RESERVE

00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:27.371
THAT IS TRENDING SIGNIFICANTLY

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:28.872
DOWNWARDS AND WILL HIT ZERO IN

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:32.476
THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS -- I THINK

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:34.244
I'LL MAKE SOME CHANGES SO.

00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:35.980
WHAT WE'VE GOT BEFORE YOU WILL

00:43:36.046 --> 00:43:36.780
BEFORE SAID THAT I WANT TO SAY

00:43:36.847 --> 00:43:38.148
THAT IN THE LAST TWO BUDGET

00:43:38.215 --> 00:43:39.616
CYCLES WE HAVE REDUCED THE

00:43:39.683 --> 00:43:41.285
PRESSURE ON THIS ACCOUNT?

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:42.753
BUT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.054
SO WE'VE DONE A LOT OVER THE

00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:45.422
LAST TWO YEARS I THANK YOUR

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:47.124
STAFF MR HACKER AND OTHERS WHO

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:48.492
HAVE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH US.

00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:49.626
AND OF COURSE FINANCE TO FIGURE

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:51.862
OUT WAYS TO DO THAT AND WE'VE

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:52.296
WE'VE DONE IT QUITE

00:43:52.363 --> 00:43:54.131
SUBSTANTIALLY WE STILL AREN'T

00:43:54.198 --> 00:43:54.765
THERE.

00:43:54.832 --> 00:43:55.799
BUT WHAT WE'VE GOT BEFORE YOU

00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:57.067
THIS MORNING IS AN ADDITIONAL

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:59.303
ABOUT TEN MILLION PER YEAR.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:01.005
THAT WOULD FURTHER REDUCE THE

00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:02.740
PRESSURE ON THIS ACCOUNT -- NOT

00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:08.612
GET US ALL THE WAY THERE BUT IT

00:44:08.679 --> 00:44:09.913
WOULD BE A HUGE HELP

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:10.214
[inaudible]

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.416
BELIAU -- YES WE RECOMMEND

00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:14.251
ADOPTING THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:15.519
THE APRIL FINANCE LETTER WE

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:16.020
THINK THIS DOES MAKE A

00:44:16.086 --> 00:44:16.787
SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS TOWARDS

00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:18.155
CLOSING THAT GAP.

00:44:18.222 --> 00:44:19.690
AS THE COMMISSION NOTED --

00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:21.158
THEY'RE STILL A GAP REMAINING

00:44:21.225 --> 00:44:23.460
AND SO WHAT WE'VE SUGGESTED AS

00:44:23.527 --> 00:44:24.728
YOU STARTED YOUR CONVERSATION

00:44:24.795 --> 00:44:26.330
ALREADY IS WHAT ARE THOSE OTHER

00:44:26.397 --> 00:44:27.564
OPTIONS THAT MIGHT STILL BE

00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:30.768
AVAILABLE -- TO FULLY CLOSE THE

00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:32.469
GAP.

00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:34.805
THE THESE OPTIONS AS WELL THAT

00:44:34.872 --> 00:44:36.407
WE KNOW IN THE AGENDA AS WELL AS

00:44:36.473 --> 00:44:37.941
OTHERS ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE

00:44:38.008 --> 00:44:39.410
COMMISSION REPORT THAT CAME OUT

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:41.278
EARLIER THIS YEAR -- ULTIMATELY

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:43.147
WHETHER YOU -- YOU DO HAVE SOME

00:44:43.213 --> 00:44:44.848
TIME YOU DON'T HAVE TO DOT MORE

00:44:44.915 --> 00:44:47.618
THAN WAS PROPOSED TODAY THE THE

00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:49.853
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT REMAIN BUT IT.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.922
DOESN'T GO INTO THE RESERVES ARE

00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:53.290
DEPLETED RESERVES UNTIL TWENTY

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:54.725
AT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SO

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:55.859
YOU HAVE SOME TIME.

00:44:55.926 --> 00:44:57.761
BUT IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO FULLY

00:44:57.828 --> 00:44:58.996
CLOSED THE GAP NOW WE WOULD

00:44:59.063 --> 00:45:00.431
RECOMMEND GUESS IF YOU HAVE THE

00:45:00.497 --> 00:45:01.532
LAST TWO YEARS THE DOCKING

00:45:01.598 --> 00:45:02.966
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE.

00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:04.068
REQUIRING THE COMMISSION TO COME

00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:06.970
BACK TO YOU AGAIN NEXT YEAR WITH

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:08.605
ADDITIONAL OPTIONS.

00:45:08.672 --> 00:45:09.673
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION I I KNOW

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.775
THAT SOME LEGISLATORS WHENEVER

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:13.110
WE HAVE A TWO THIRDS VOTE KIT

00:45:13.177 --> 00:45:14.711
LITTLE SQUEAMISH ABOUT ABOUT

00:45:14.778 --> 00:45:17.714
THAT BUT AS AS FAR AS GRANTING

00:45:17.781 --> 00:45:20.250
THE AUTHORITY YOU KNOW WERE --

00:45:20.317 --> 00:45:22.186
WE'RE ALL WE ALL HAD MATH SO

00:45:22.252 --> 00:45:25.456
WE'VE GOT POINT. ZERO ZERO THREE

00:45:25.522 --> 00:45:28.358
THREE TEN THOUSANDTHS.

00:45:28.425 --> 00:45:30.327
THE VIRUS AT THREE TEN THOUSANDS

00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:32.830
PER KILOWATT HOUR -- IF THE

00:45:32.896 --> 00:45:35.099
AUTHORITY WERE BUT LET'S SEE

00:45:35.165 --> 00:45:36.700
RIGHT MEASUREMENT AND BECAUSE WE

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:38.168
DON'T WANT WE DON'T WANT

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:39.770
LEGISLATORS TO BE WORKING YOU

00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:41.438
KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO RAISE THE

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:42.039
CAP.

00:45:42.106 --> 00:45:43.774
WE DON'T WANT LEGISLATORS TO

00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:47.144
COME BACK -- OR HAVE TO VOTE ON

00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:48.846
THIS ON AN ANNUAL BIG ANNUAL

00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:50.414
BASIS BECAUSE PER IS AN

00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:52.616
IMPORTANT PROGRAM BUT THE BUT WE

00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:53.851
REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE TO COME

00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:56.987
TO US IF WE RAISE THE CAP.

00:45:57.054 --> 00:46:00.157
I'M JUST MAKING UP NUMBERS. FOR

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:01.125
TEN THOUSANDS YOU KNOW JUST TO

00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:02.459
PICK BECAUSE I GUESS WE GO THREE

00:46:02.526 --> 00:46:04.461
POINT THREE FIVE TWO TWO TWO OR

00:46:04.528 --> 00:46:06.096
WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS IF WE DID.

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:09.967
pCLOSE THAT STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BY

00:46:10.033 --> 00:46:11.802
JUST USING A TINY PORTION OF

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:14.471
THAT -- AS A AS AN INCREASE IN

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:15.139
THEN YOU WOULD HAVE THAT RESERVE

00:46:15.205 --> 00:46:18.208
AS THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND THE

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:20.811
THESE OTHER MATTERS GO ON OR

00:46:20.878 --> 00:46:21.678
MAYBE NEVER USE IT.

00:46:21.745 --> 00:46:24.948
DO YOU HAVE A OPINION.

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:26.316
HE READ THE REPORT YES.

00:46:26.383 --> 00:46:28.652
NO A A CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:30.420
HAS DISCRETIONTO RAISE THAT

00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:34.191
CAPPED WHATEVER IT DECIDES THE

00:46:34.258 --> 00:46:35.659
AND IS IT IS -- PROGRAMS WORK IN

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:36.894
THE PAST THE THERE'S BEEN THE

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.229
STATUTORY CAP AND PRIOR TO THAT

00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:40.564
THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT --

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:44.101
THEY DIDN'T FULLY -- A UTILIZED

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:45.536
IN THE ENTIRE SPACE THAT WAS

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:47.437
AVAILABLE THE YOU COULD FOR

00:46:47.504 --> 00:46:49.406
EXAMPLE INCREASE THE CAP TO SOME

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:51.275
HIGHER LEVEL KNOWING THAT THAT

00:46:51.341 --> 00:46:52.109
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAN THAT

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:53.877
YOU -- THE COMMISSION WOULD

00:46:53.944 --> 00:46:55.646
CHARGE THAT FULL AMOUNT AND

00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:58.348
INSTEAD IT WOULD BE DICTATED BY.

00:46:58.415 --> 00:47:01.451
WHATEVER BUDGET PROPOSALS ARE

00:47:01.518 --> 00:47:03.954
APPROVED BY YOU TO PROVIDE

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:05.856
PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE SERVICES

00:47:05.923 --> 00:47:07.491
USING THE HERB OF FINE AND SO

00:47:07.558 --> 00:47:08.592
YOU COULD IMAGINE A SCENARIO
