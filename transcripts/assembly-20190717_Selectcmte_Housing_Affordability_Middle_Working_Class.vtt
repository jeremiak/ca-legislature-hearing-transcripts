WE THINK THIS IS A A REAL AREA

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:00.273
FOR EXPLORING IN THE FUTURE

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:00.907
BECAUSE IT BRINGS THE BEST OF

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:21.460
THE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE IN TWO

00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:22.028

QUARTER THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:25.231
HOUSING CRISIS.

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:25.765
THE COMMUNITY LAND TRUST

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:29.201
MORTGAGES WERE A TINY TINY

00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:29.869
FRACTION OF EVEN PRIME MORTGAGES

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:32.872
IN TERMS OF SERVICE

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:33.506
DELINQUENCIES ARE FORECLOSURES.

00:09:33.572 --> 00:09:34.006
THAT'S A FUNCTION OF THE

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:37.109
STEWARDSHIP.

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:37.710
SO ON TO WHAT CAN BE DONE TO

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:38.377
HELP LEGISLATION AND POLICIES TO

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:41.447

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:42.114
OF COURSE REDUCING COSTS FOR LOW

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:42.648
AND MODERATE INCOME HOME

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:45.818
DEVELOPMENT AND I KNOW BUT A

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:46.118
SUBSEQUENT.

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:46.585
PANEL WILL TALK ABOUT

00:09:46.652 --> 00:09:47.119
STREAMLINING THE APPROVAL

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:49.622
PROCESS.

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:50.289
ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT --

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:54.226
PORT ONE OF THE IMPORTANT WAYS

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:54.527
TO DO THAT.

00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:55.227
IS -- SB ONE NINETY SIX WHICH IS

00:09:55.294 --> 00:09:55.795
CURRENTLY IN THE ASSEMBLY.

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:58.331
WHICH WOULD EXPAND THE WELFARE

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:02.101
EXEMPTION DURING CONSTRUCTION

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:02.601
FOR COMMUNITY LAND TRUST

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:02.868
PROJECTS.

MARTIN JOHN TO HELP REDUCE THE

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:06.339
COST.

00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:07.006
ANOTHER ATTACK AREAS TO IMPROVE

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:07.640
ACCESS TO FINANCIAL RESOURCES.

00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:10.776
FOR NONPROFIT PROVIDERS LIKE

00:10:10.843 --> 00:10:11.243
COMMUNITY LAND TRUST.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.847
CAPACITY GRANTS OR FUNDS FOR PRE

00:10:14.914 --> 00:10:15.448
DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:18.784
SIMILAR TO THE PROP ONE AND CAL

00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:19.318
HOME -- PROGRAM THAT IS

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:22.989
CURRENTLY ARE GOING THROUGH THE

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:27.126
DEREGULATION PHASE.

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:27.760
AND OR TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO RAW

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:31.464
MATERIALS AND THAT'S WHERE WE

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.131
TALK ABOUT SURPLUS PROPERTIES --

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:35.668
SURPLUS PROP PROPERTY IS A RAW

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:36.268
MATERIAL FOR HOUSING YOU NEED

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:39.739
PROPERTY TO BUILD A HOUSING.

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:40.373
A COUPLE OF BILLS THAT ARE VERY

00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:41.007
IMPORTANT IN THIS LEGISLATION

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:43.976
ARE SB SIX TO PROVIDE A

00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:44.510
CENTRALIZED DATABASE OF

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:45.144
AVAILABLE SURPLUS PROPERTIES.

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:48.347
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:49.015
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE INVENTORY IS

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:52.284
SO WE KNOW.

00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:52.952
WHERE TO GO TO TRY TO FIND THOSE

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:56.355
RESOURCES?

00:10:56.422 --> 00:10:56.822
ALSO THE PRIORITY FOR

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:57.456
DEVELOPMENT OF LOW AND MODERATE

00:10:57.523 --> 00:11:00.726
INCOMES -- THERE THERE'S A B.

00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:01.293
FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX THAT IS

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.697
GOING TO THE ASSEMBLY AND I

00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:05.331
THINK IS NOW WE ARE GOING TO THE

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:05.564
SENATE.

00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:08.968
SO THINGS LIKE THAT ARE VERY

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:09.635
IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF OF HELPING

00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:10.269
COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS AND OTHER

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:10.870
NON PROFITS GET ACCESS TO THE

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:13.039
RAW MATERIAL.

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:13.639
ALSO WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS TO

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:14.206
ENSURE THAT LEGISLATION AND

00:11:14.273 --> 00:11:17.443
POLICY IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERS

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.144
COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS EXPLICITLY.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.547
AS AN IMPORTANT PROVIDER OF LOW

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:22.081
AND MODERATE INCOME HOMES

00:11:22.148 --> 00:11:22.715
INCLUDING OWNERSHIP [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:22.782 --> 00:11:25.651
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:26.185
IT MAY BE IMPORTANT IT IS

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:26.652
IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:30.056
SPECIFICALLY AND DEFINITION OF

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:30.589
COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS.

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:31.223
WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF HOUSING

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.993
SPONSOR.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:34.660
RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT CLEAR -- AND

00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:38.197
I THINK IT WOULD HELP TO

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:38.864
RECOGNIZE COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS.

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:42.301
AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:42.768
PROVIDING EXPANDING.

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:43.369
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW AND

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:46.439
MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES.

00:11:46.505 --> 00:11:50.776
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS SUCH A NINE

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:51.077
OF OF BABY.

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:51.677
FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX THAT DOES

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:51.944
PROVIDE.

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:55.114
THAT A PRIORITY BE GIVEN IN

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:55.681
TERMS OF A CONFLICT OF TWO

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:59.018
PROPOSALS THAT ARE EQUAL.

00:11:59.085 --> 00:11:59.618
THE PRIORITY BE GIVEN TO THE

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:00.152
MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ROOFS.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:03.456
OR THE DEEPEST INCOME LEVEL

00:12:03.522 --> 00:12:03.689
SERVED.

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:07.393
THAT I THINK.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:07.993
ON INTENTIONALLY DISADVANTAGES

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.464
LOW AND MODERATE OWNERSHIP.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.098
DUE TO THE DIFFERENT ECONOMICS

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:12.765
AND THE FEASIBILITY OF OWNERSHIP

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:13.032
PROJECTS.

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:15.668
OWNERSHIP PROJECTS GENERALLY

00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:16.335
DON'T HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.002
SUBSIDIES LIKE TAX CREDITS LIKE

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:19.872
LOW INCOME RENTAL DOES.

00:12:19.939 --> 00:12:20.506
SO WE SHOULD JUST BE AWARE WHEN

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:23.909
WE MAKE -- PROVISIONS LIKE THIS

00:12:23.976 --> 00:12:24.477

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:52.565
ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA SO IT

00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:55.968
TAKES SOME TIME I THINK FOR

00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:56.569
COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND HOW

00:13:56.635 --> 00:13:59.939
COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS CAN HELP.

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:00.372
SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:01.073
AND ONE OF THEM ONE OF THE IDEA

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.343
WHEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.010
COMMITTEE LAND TRUST IT THERE'S

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:05.644
THIS GREAT RECOGNITION THAT IT'S

00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:06.245
A WONDERFUL MODEL IS ALWAYS

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:08.314
WONDERFUL THINGS.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:08.914
SO WE THINK THAT WE CAN JUST

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:12.484
CREATE A COMMUNITY LAND TRUST.

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:13.152
TRANSFER ALL THE PROBLEMS TO THE

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:13.752
COMMUNITY LAND TRUST BUT NOT

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:14.386
PROVIDE THE RESOURCES FOR THEM

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:16.689
TO DO IT SO.

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:17.323
THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.890
OF THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO DO

00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:21.060
WITH AND EXPAND THE COMMUNITY

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:21.660
LAND TRUST NETWORK THROUGHOUT

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:22.294
CALIFORNIA GET MORE COMMUNITIES

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:22.561
INVOLVED.

00:14:22.628 --> 00:14:25.364
AND I WOULD SAY THEY'RE PROBABLY

00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:25.965
THREE OR FOUR COMMUNITY LAND

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:29.168
TRUST THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED JUST

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:29.802
EACH YEAR IN THE LAST THREE OR

00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:33.606
FOUR YEARS SO IT IS GROWING IN

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:33.906
CALIFORNIA.

00:14:33.973 --> 00:14:37.676
IMPORTANT THE NEXT SLIDE IN

00:14:37.743 --> 00:14:38.310
TERMS OF THAT THAT THE INCOMING

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:41.914
NEEDED PEACE I BECAUSE POSTED

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:42.548
NECESSARILY MAKE IT OUT ON THE

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:43.015
ON THIS ON THE GRAPH.

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:46.185
THE FIRST OF IS DECEPTIVE IT

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:46.785
KIND OF LOOKS LIKE SAN DIEGO

00:14:46.852 --> 00:14:47.453
MIGHT BE A BARGAIN AND I'VE MADE

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:50.222
RIGHT BY COMPARISON THE SAN

00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:50.856
FRANCISCO PROCESS TRUE BUT YOU

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:54.059

THOSE THE ANNUAL INCOME NEED IT

00:14:58.397 --> 00:14:58.964
IS BASED ON A 10% DOWN PAYMENT

00:14:59.031 --> 00:14:59.632
THE GRAPH RIGHT OUT WILL WANT TO

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:02.935
THE LEFT HAND COLUMN IS 10% DOWN

00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:03.602
PAYMENT THE ONE NEXT TO IT WHICH

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:04.203
HAS A SLIGHTLY HIGHER INCOME

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.872
REQUIREMENT IS A 3% DOWN PAYMENT.

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:10.976
SO YOU'RE GIVING -- AND TO PUT

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:11.610
TO THE PURCHASE OF A HOME RIGHT

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:15.147
OKAY -- AND THEN I JUST LOVE THE

HOUSING LADDER ON YOUR NEXT

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:16.382
SLIDE AND IF WE CAN BRING THAT

00:15:16.448 --> 00:15:16.949
ONE UP BUT YOU KNOW I THINK

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:19.551
OFTEN AND I THINK LEASE LOWS --

00:15:19.618 --> 00:15:20.085
PRESENTATION LATER REALLY

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:23.289
ILLUSTRATE THE FACT THEY ARE

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:23.922
LATTER DOESN'T HAVE SLOTS -- IN

00:15:23.989 --> 00:15:24.523
THE MIDDLE ANY LONGER AND YOU

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.526
HAVE A HUGE YAWNING GAP BETWEEN

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:28.160
THE TOP AND A LOT OF THE BOTTOM

00:15:28.227 --> 00:15:28.794
OF THE LADDER -- I'M GRATEFUL

00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:29.395
THAT YOU KIND OF PAINT THAT

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:30.029
PICTURE BECAUSE PEOPLE DO YOU

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:31.830
SEE CONSTRUCTION IN THE

00:15:31.897 --> 00:15:32.364
COMMUNITY AND THEY DON'T

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:33.032
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT'S NOT TO SAY

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:36.035
DIRECTLY BENEFITING THEN WE'RE

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:36.468
NOT TALKING ABOUT.

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:37.036
THE FOCUS OF THIS COMMITTEE

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:37.670
WHICH IS AGAIN SORT OF BILLION

00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:40.205
THAT MIDDLE SECTION FOR THE WORK

00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:40.639
THAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:15:40.706 --> 00:15:41.206
WITH REGARD TO THE TO THE

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:44.476
FORMATION YOU MENTIONED THAT THE

00:15:44.543 --> 00:15:45.077
OF THE PROPERTY OWNERSHIP IS

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:48.314
RETAINED BY THE LAND TRUST.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:48.914
IS IT FAIR TO CALL THIS ALMOST

00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:49.581
LIKE A LIKE A IS A TRAILER PARK

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:52.818
CAMINO MOBILE HOMES HAVE A BIT A

00:15:52.885 --> 00:16:04.997
STIGMA MILITANT -- TO IT'S IT'S

00:16:05.064 --> 00:16:05.597
A USE OF THE VEHICLE YOU KNOW

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:06.198
FOR NO PUN INTENDED -- FOR FOR

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:09.501
THE GROW THE WEALTH RIGHT IN THE

00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:10.102
HOMEOWNERSHIP AND WHAT I WAS

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:10.569
INTENDED TO GO WELL.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:11.236
NEVER OWN THE ACTUAL LAND RIGHT

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:13.839
RIGHT SO HOW DOES SOMEONE WHO

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:14.473
PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM HOW

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.074
DO YOU DAY BESIDES THE OBVIOUS

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.609
TO BE ABLE TO GET A PRICE POINT

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:18.010
THEY CAN AFFORD.

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:18.610
HOW DOES THIS WORK FOR THEIR

00:16:18.677 --> 00:16:19.244
FAMILY TO BILL GENERATIONAL OFF

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:19.878
THAT ALLOWS THEM TO YOU KNOW BE

00:16:19.945 --> 00:16:21.747
REALIZED?

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:22.348
BETWEEN THE WERE TOLD RUSSIA

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:22.781
EXCELLENT QUESTION.

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:26.385
THE THE RESALE FORMULA CAN VERY

00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:26.985
FROM MY INTEREST IN ONE OF THE

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:30.089
GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE COMMUNITY

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:30.756
ELECTIONS MODEL IS ITS FLEXIBLE

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:31.390
AND IT CAN BE ADAPTED TO LOCAL

00:16:31.457 --> 00:16:31.690
SITUATIONS.

00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:34.660
OF FOR EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA IN

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:35.260
THE SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY LAND

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:42.735
TRUST THEIR RESALE FORMULAS TIED

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:43.335
TO CHANGES IN ANY OF MY SO A

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:46.805
FAMILY THE BUYS A COMMUNITY LAND

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:47.473
TRUST OHMS THROUGH THE SAN DIEGO

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:47.973
COMMUNITY LAND TRUST.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:48.607
THEY THEY CAN SELL ANY TIME THEY

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:51.377
WANT THERE'S NO RESTRICTION ON

00:16:51.443 --> 00:16:51.744
WHEN THEY SELL.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.344
BUT IF IF THE TRUST HAD PRICE

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:55.414
THE HOME SO WAS AFFORDABLE TO

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:56.048
FOUNDING EARNING A HARPER 100%

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:59.351
OF SAN DIEGO AREA MEDIAN INCOME.

00:16:59.418 --> 00:16:59.952
WHEN THEY GO TO SELL IT HAS TO

00:17:00.018 --> 00:17:00.552
BE AFFORDABLE TO A FAMILY AT

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:03.455
THAT POINT IN TIME?

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:04.156
EARNING A 100% OF THE AIRLINE SO

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:04.823
WHATEVER CHANGE IN ANY OF MY IS

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.960
THAT'S THE FIRST LEVEL OF EQUITY

00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:11.830
GROWTH THAT THEY HAVE -- IN

00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:12.464
ADDITION THEN I HAVE OWNERSHIP

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:13.098
WHICH IS AT AND WE WILL ONLY

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:16.301
PERMIT FIXED RATE THIRTY YEAR

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:17.002
MORTGAGES SO THERE'S NO VARIABLE

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.669
RATE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO WE

00:17:17.736 --> 00:17:20.706
FIX THEIR HOUSING COSTS I'M LIKE

00:17:20.773 --> 00:17:20.939
RENTAL.

00:17:21.006 --> 00:17:21.640
AYE WEATHER CHARTS AND I'VE DONE

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.510
THAT SHOW A COMPARISON BETWEEN.

00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:25.110
RENT EVEN IN THE WORLD EVEN

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:28.614
DURING THE HOUSING CRISIS RENT

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:28.881
GOES UP.

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:29.548
RAMPING RANT IS NEGATIVE EQUITY.

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:32.651
HERE.

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:33.352
IS NOT THE SAME GROWTH IS IF YOU

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:34.052
HAVE THE GOOD LUCK TO BUY A HOME

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:37.289
AND IT WAS LOW MARKET RATE HOME

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:38.023
AND SO WHEN IT WAS FINE YEAH BUT

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.126
YOU ALSO DON'T HAVE THE RISK.

00:17:41.193 --> 00:17:41.727
OF BUYING ONE AT THE BEACON

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:45.531
SELLING AND LOSING 50% OF YOUR

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:45.764
EQUITY.

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:49.368
SO IT IS SLOW BUT STEADY AND IT

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:50.035
DOES PROVIDE FOR EQUITY GROW SEE

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:53.505
OKAY SO THE EQUITY THAT IS K.

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:54.106
DOES NOT PERTAIN BY THAT LAND

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:54.706
TRUST IS RETAINED BY THE OWNER

00:17:54.773 --> 00:17:58.043
THAT'S RIGHT IF THEY WANT OKAY --

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.577
I WAS VERY HIGH LIKE THE

00:17:58.644 --> 00:17:59.244
PERPETUAL AFFORDABILITY PIECE OF

00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:02.047
THE MODEL -- FOR THOSE THAT WERE

00:18:02.114 --> 00:18:02.681
A LOT ABOUT RETAINING YOU KNOW

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:03.315
WHAT WE'RE OFTEN INTERESTED IN

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:05.951
BUILDING NEW SUBSIDIZE UNITS.

00:18:06.018 --> 00:18:10.122
BUT THE RETAINING AND AND AND ON

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:10.756
DAHLE GOING TO PORTABILITY OF

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:11.423
PROJECTS THAT THAT TIME OUT THIS

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.860
THIS MODEL SOLVE THAT PARTICULAR

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:15.461
PROBLEM ISN'T THAT ONE OF THE

00:18:15.527 --> 00:18:16.128
THINGS THAT I TRY TO DO IS WORK

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:16.762
WITH DEVELOPERS WHEN THEY HAVE

00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:18.764
INCLUSIONARY UNITS OR DEED

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:19.198
RESTRICTED UNITS OR

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:19.765
MUNICIPALITIES OR MANAGING.

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:22.935
THOSE PROGRAMS WHEN ONE OF THOSE

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:23.469
UNITS BECOMES AVAILABLE.

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:26.839
PUT IT IN OUR OUR PORTFOLIO

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:27.339
BECAUSE THEN IT BECOMES

00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:27.973
PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE THROUGH

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:35.214
THE NINETY NINE YOUR RENEWABLE

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:35.481
FAMILIES.

00:18:35.547 --> 00:18:35.681
JUST.

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:40.853
LEGISLATION THAT WORK ALL THESE

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:43.822
ARE ACTIVE BILLS YES -- BY GOOD

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:44.423
AUTHOR SO I THINK YOU STAND A

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.057
GOOD CHANCE SOMEBODY'S BECOMING

00:18:45.123 --> 00:18:48.126
LAW -- THERE IS A DIFFERENCE

00:18:48.193 --> 00:18:52.297
JUST -- ON THAT WHAT WITH THE

00:18:52.364 --> 00:18:56.401
ONE THAT POPPED OUT SEEING I

00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:57.002
THINK YOU'RE ALLUDING TO AS A

00:18:57.069 --> 00:18:57.503
POTENTIAL PIECE OF THE

00:18:57.569 --> 00:18:58.103
LEGISLATIVE IDEA FOR FUTURE

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.405
LEGISLATIVE SESSION.

00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:01.039
IS INCLUDING CLT THE DEFINITION

00:19:01.106 --> 00:19:01.640
OF A HOUSING SPONSORED THAT IS

00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:04.476
WRONG INTRODUCED LEGISLATION

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:05.110
THAT IS RIGHT -- YEAH YEAH I'M

00:19:05.177 --> 00:19:05.744
SORRY THERE THERE IS REGULATION

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:08.647
FOR EXAMPLE THE REGULATIONS THAT

00:19:08.714 --> 00:19:09.248
ARE BEING PROMULGATED NOW IN

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:09.948
TERMS OF THE HOME PROGRAM -- THE

00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:13.118
THE CAL HOME PROGRAM YEAH --

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:13.652
WE'VE ACTUALLY SUBMITTED

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:14.253
COMMENTS SUGGESTING THAT THEY

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:16.922
MAKE A IN THE IN THE DEFINITIONS

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:17.589
FOR THEM PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY ON

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:18.156
THE DEFINING COMMUNITY LAND

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:18.390
TRUSTS.

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:21.026
WHEN THERE ARE OTHER FUNDING

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:21.693
SOURCES THAT THEY COULD USE THIS

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.264
GUIDANCE YES?

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:25.931
OKAY WE'LL KEEP THIS POST ON IT.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:26.598
THAT'S DONE BY REGULATION IF NOT

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:27.232
MAYBE BY LEGISLATION WE SHOULD

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:29.868
LOOK FOR IT IS FOR THE TWENTY

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:30.402
TWENTY LEGISLATIVE YEAR.

00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:33.972
I THINK THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE --

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:38.110
AND I WAS ABLE TO PROBLEMS BILLS

00:19:38.176 --> 00:19:38.544

BEFORE ABOUT BUT THE MOVE TO THE

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:43.515
NEXT AS A NO JUST GET OTHER

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:46.418
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IT MAY NOT A

00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:47.019
VOTE VOTED ON THESE BILLS YEAH

00:19:47.085 --> 00:19:47.519
PLEASE VOTE FOR THEM.

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:50.522
I I KNOW THAT -- ONE NINETY SIX

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:51.089
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US AND

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:51.723
THAT'S IN THE ASSEMBLY RIGHT NOW

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:52.324
SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL GET TO

00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:54.593
THE FOR VERY SOON.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.160
ALL YOU KNOW THE TRIGGERS A

00:19:55.227 --> 00:19:55.827
QUESTION I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT --

00:19:55.894 --> 00:19:58.764
WE TOOK OUR OFTEN WITH PUBLIC

00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:59.431
SUBSIDY OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN

00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:00.032
PARTICULAR PROJECTS COMES --

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:03.268
WORKER -- GUIDELINES AND LEVELS

PAY THINGS OF THAT NATURE IS

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.585
THAT TRUE FOR LAND TRUSTS -- I

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:20.252
THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE SPECIFIC

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:23.555
SOURCES OF FUNDS PROVIDED TO OUR

00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:24.289
COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS -- TO SOME --

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:24.923
SOME FORMS OF OF SUBSIDY WOULD

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.060
REQUIRE FOR EXAMPLE -- IN

00:20:28.126 --> 00:20:32.097
CERTAIN WAYS RESTRICTIONS ARE.

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:32.731
INVITING US ABSOLUTELY CHASING

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:36.234
CARRYING MY COME ON DOWN.

00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:40.505
AND IS SUCH AS MEDICAL PERCENT

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:45.043
WHICH IN EITHER OF THAT IS IN

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.577
CALIFORNIA PART OF GENERAL

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:46.044
SERVICES REAL ESTATE.

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:48.680
DIVISION.

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:49.281
IS MAYBE NOT I WAS LOOKING FOR

00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:52.784
US TO TODAY NO PRESSURE.

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:56.989

FOR EFFICIENT PRESENTATION TEARS --

00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:01.927
I'LL DO MY BEST THANK YOU -- SO

00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:02.561
WE OBVIOUSLY THE ADMINISTRATION

00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:05.464
WANTS TO DO ITS PART -- AND

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:06.031
DRIVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:06.698
DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE STATE AND

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:09.768
SO EXECUTIVE ORDER AND SIX

00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:10.369
NINETEEN AS WE ARE TALK ABOUT

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:13.705
TODAY -- UNDER A COUPLE THINGS

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:14.306
ONE JUST KIND OF GIVE A QUICK

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:14.906
BRIEF -- HIGHLIGHTS OF THE

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:17.976
EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THERE'S ONE

00:21:18.043 --> 00:21:18.644
THING I WANT TO FOCUS ON WHICH

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:19.177
IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:19.811
SURPLUS AND ACCESS PROPERTY.

00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:22.214
AS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:22.848
THIS BECAUSE THIS IS A REALLY A

00:21:22.914 --> 00:21:23.448
FIRST OF ITS KIND OF PROCESS

00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:26.752
THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH -- AND

00:21:26.818 --> 00:21:27.419
WE'LL TALK ABOUT KIND OF THE THE

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:30.355
ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION STEPS AN

00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:31.023
EXECUTIVE ORDER AND WHEREAS WITH

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:31.657
THAT SPECIFICALLY AND THEN THE

00:21:31.723 --> 00:21:34.760
RESULTS TO DATE -- AND KIND OF

00:21:34.826 --> 00:21:35.360
WHAT THE THE THE FUTURE LOOKS

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:38.697
LIKE FOR US.

00:21:38.764 --> 00:21:39.264
SO -- IN TERMS OF THIS THIS

00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:39.865
ACCESS OUR CLOSEST ENGINE SO

00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:43.335
STATE PROPERTY IS IS OWNED BY

00:21:43.402 --> 00:21:44.002
THE STATE BUT IT'S HELD IN TRUST

00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:44.603
BY DEPARTMENTS AND WE COULD BE

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.137
COULD BE TERM THAT HAVING

00:21:45.203 --> 00:21:47.272
JURISDICTION OVER A PIECE OF

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:47.906
PROPERTY -- AND SO DEPARTMENTS

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:48.507
HAVE JURISDICTION OVER STATE

00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:51.677
PROPERTY AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO

00:21:51.743 --> 00:21:52.344
BE USING IT FOR THEIR TO EXECUTE

00:21:52.411 --> 00:21:55.714
THEIR MISSION -- STATE HOSPITALS

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:56.415
HAVE IT TO TREAT PATIENTS -- CHP

00:21:56.481 --> 00:21:59.818
OFFICERS HAVE IT TO PROVIDE

00:21:59.885 --> 00:22:00.552
SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY CENTER --

00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:03.855
AS THOSE PROPERTIES -- OF NO

00:22:03.922 --> 00:22:04.456
LONGER MEET THEIR NEEDS WHEN

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:05.123
THEY NEED TO RELOCATE SUPPORTING

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:08.293
IT DOWNSIZE FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:08.960
HAS CHANGED THE MISSION IN SOME

00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:09.394
WAY SHAPE OR FORM.

00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:12.464
THE WAY IT WORKS IN STATUTE IS

00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:13.031
THAT THEY WOULD DECLARE THE

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:13.665
PROPERTY ACCESS AND THAT WOULD

00:22:13.732 --> 00:22:16.401
TRIGGER DG HAS TO COME IN AND

00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:17.035
BEGIN WORKING ON A DISPOSITION

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:17.302
PROCESS.

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:17.903
THAT COULD BE TRANSFERRED TO

00:22:17.969 --> 00:22:20.739
THIS AGENCY IT COULD BE -- A

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:21.339
LONG TERM LEASE OR SOME SORT

00:22:21.406 --> 00:22:24.876
DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS DONE IN THE

00:22:24.943 --> 00:22:25.444
PAST OR IT COULD BE A SALE

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.944
PROCESS GOING THROUGH A

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:28.980
LEGISLATION TO BE AUTHORIZES

00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:32.884
SURPLUS -- HISTORICALLY WE GET

00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:33.518
ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR IS A BIG

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:34.086
YEAR OF PROPERTIES DECLARED

00:22:34.152 --> 00:22:37.055
ACCESS BY DEPARTMENTS -- IT

00:22:37.122 --> 00:22:37.622
REALLY IS NOT A VOLUMINOUS

00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:41.460
PROCESS SO WHAT THIS EXECUTIVE

00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:42.094
ORDER REPORTERS TO DO WAS TO GO

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:42.661
THROUGH AND SORT OF TO A

00:22:42.728 --> 00:22:45.697
PROACTIVE REVIEW OF STATE

00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:46.398
PROPERTY -- SO WE HAD A TEAM OF

00:22:46.465 --> 00:22:50.001
NINE PEOPLE LOOK AT FORTY FOUR

00:22:50.068 --> 00:22:50.535
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND

00:22:50.602 --> 00:22:53.872
SEVENTY PARCELS ACROSS THE STATE --

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:54.506
WHICH I WILL DOUBLE TALK ABOUT

00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:55.140
THE RESULT IN A SACK -- BUT IN

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:58.510
ADDITION TO THAT REVIEW -- THE

00:22:58.577 --> 00:22:59.177
EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRES US TO

00:22:59.244 --> 00:23:02.447
TAKE A VERY SYSTEMATIC APPROACH --

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:03.081
WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE BEING LIKE A

00:23:03.148 --> 00:23:03.782
FINAL -- WE DO INITIAL INVENTORY

00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:06.852
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO PRIORITIZE

00:23:06.918 --> 00:23:07.486
SITES FOR DEVELOPMENT -- THESE

00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:10.555
GIVE ORDER ALSO -- FOCUSES ON

00:23:10.622 --> 00:23:11.056
INNOVATIVE EQUITABLE AND

00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:11.590
SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION

00:23:11.656 --> 00:23:14.926
APPROACHES -- THERE IS A SINCERE

00:23:14.993 --> 00:23:15.527
DESIRE TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL

00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:15.994
GOVERNMENTS IN THESE

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:18.897
DEVELOPMENTS RECOGNIZING THAT

00:23:18.964 --> 00:23:19.564
ANYTHING WE BUILD IS GOING TO BE

00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:22.968
IN SOMEONE'S COMMUNITY -- AND IF

00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:23.602
IF YOU READ EXECUTIVE ORDER YOU

00:23:23.668 --> 00:23:24.269
SEE A LOT OF EXPEDITED DATES WE

00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:35.947
WANT TO BUILD THIS WE WANT ALL

00:23:36.014 --> 00:23:36.381
THESE THINGS FAST.

00:23:36.448 --> 00:23:37.048
SO WHAT ARE PROCESS STEPS SO ONE

00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:39.751
VISUAL INVENTORY -- AND THAT HAS

00:23:39.818 --> 00:23:40.352
BEEN COMPLETED -- PARTNERING

00:23:40.418 --> 00:23:40.952
TOGETHER H. C. D. AND D. G. S.

00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:41.586
HAVE CREATED A SCREENING TOOL --

00:23:41.653 --> 00:23:44.289
THAT THOSE PARCELS HAVE BEEN

00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:44.956
UNDERGONE IN TERMS OF HELPING US

00:23:45.023 --> 00:23:45.624
SORT OF UNDERSTAND YES SOMETHING

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.260
MIGHT BE DEVELOPING BOWL BUT IS

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:48.860
IT APPROPRIATE FOR HOUSING --

00:23:48.927 --> 00:23:49.494
AND THEN THE NEXT BIG STEP WAS

00:23:49.561 --> 00:23:52.564
TAKEN AWHILE IS TO ACTUALLY GO

00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:53.231
THROUGH DEPARTMENTAL BETTING --

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:53.832
WE'VE LOOKED AT PARCELS THAT

00:23:53.899 --> 00:23:56.701
THAT -- THAT COULD BE OVER

00:23:56.768 --> 00:23:57.302
HOUSING THAT WERE APPROPRIATE

00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:57.936
FOR THE BILL FOR HOUSING -- BUT

00:23:58.003 --> 00:24:00.672
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT THE SITE

00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:01.139
DIDN'T HAVE A MILLION

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:01.773
ENCUMBRANCES ON IT THAT DIDN'T

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.976
MEAN THAT THE SITE WAS INTO SHE

00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:05.577
TO THE STATE TWENTY FIVE YEARS

00:24:05.644 --> 00:24:08.914
AGO FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE --

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.548
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT -- THAT

00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:10.215
APARTMENT ACTUALLY WASN'T USING

00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:13.185
IT JUST IN TIME WE EVALUATED

00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:13.819
THEY THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO BE --

00:24:13.885 --> 00:24:14.352
AND SO WE WENT THROUGH A

00:24:14.419 --> 00:24:17.189
DEPARTMENTAL VETTING PROCESS TO

00:24:17.255 --> 00:24:17.823
GET TO SITES WHERE DEPARTMENTS

00:24:17.889 --> 00:24:18.523
HAVE AGREED YES THIS LIKE CAN BE

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.593
DECLARED ACCESS SO WE CAN MOVE

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.227
FORWARD -- AND THAT HAS ALSO

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:25.497
BEEN COMPLETED JUST RECENTLY SO --

00:24:25.564 --> 00:24:25.997
NOW WE'RE AT THE SITE

00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:26.631
PRIVATIZATION PIECE WHAT WE'RE

00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:27.299
GOING THROUGH AND LOOKING AT THE

00:24:27.365 --> 00:24:30.268
NUMBER OF SITES WE HAVE ACROSS

00:24:30.335 --> 00:24:30.936
THE STATE PRIORITIZING -- WHICH

00:24:31.002 --> 00:24:33.905
ONES WILL GET DEVELOPED -- THE

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:34.539
NEXT STEPS IN THE FUTURE BEYOND

00:24:34.606 --> 00:24:38.143
THAT WOULD BE -- TO PUBLISHER

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.710
HEAT MAP SHOWING ALL OF OUR

00:24:38.777 --> 00:24:39.377
SITES WITH AN OVERLAY OF WHERE

00:24:39.444 --> 00:24:42.147
HOUSING IS MOST NEEDED.

00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:42.747
ACROSS THE STATE -- THEN WILL

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:43.348
TAKE THOSE -- PRIORITIZE SITES

00:24:43.415 --> 00:24:46.384
BEGIN TO DO REAL ESTATE DUE

00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:47.052
DILIGENCE AND THEN -- ISSUE ARE

00:24:47.118 --> 00:24:47.686
PEAS AND ART THAT THE EXECUTIVE

00:24:47.752 --> 00:24:50.922
ORDER HAS A DEADLINE FOR THE

00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:51.523
FIRST OUR PIECE TO GO OUT IN

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:52.157
SEPTEMBER THE END OF SEPTEMBER

00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:59.331
OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO COMING UP

00:24:59.397 --> 00:25:03.134
VERY SOON.

00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:03.702
SO WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE SO

00:25:03.768 --> 00:25:04.302
440-003-0070 PARCELS -- THEY

00:25:04.369 --> 00:25:07.305
WERE REVIEWED IT PRIMARILY FOR

00:25:07.372 --> 00:25:07.939
TWO THINGS -- DEVELOPED ABILITY

00:25:08.006 --> 00:25:11.543
AND USE SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:12.177
SHEA FILES WERE LOOKING AT THE

00:25:12.244 --> 00:25:12.811
SIGHTS THEMSELVES ARE THEY OF

00:25:12.878 --> 00:25:13.478
THE RIGHT SIZE AND WE'RE LOOKING

00:25:13.545 --> 00:25:16.047
IN A LARGE AND SMALL -- SO LONG

00:25:16.114 --> 00:25:16.681
AS ARE NOT LIKE STRIPS OF LAND

00:25:16.748 --> 00:25:19.885
OR THEY UNDER FREEWAY.

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:20.518
ARE THEY UNDER WATER THINGS LIKE

00:25:20.585 --> 00:25:21.152
THAT -- WE HAVE QUITE A FEW OF

00:25:21.219 --> 00:25:24.055
THOSE BELIEVE IT OR NOT -- AND

00:25:24.122 --> 00:25:24.689
THEN AT THE SAME POINT IN TIME

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:25.290
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR A USAGE

00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:28.560
SO IS IT A VACANT PARKING LOT --

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:32.297
IN SOME CASES WE MIGHT HAVE --

00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:32.898
BOUGHT PROPERTY FOR A AND ET

00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:36.334
FACILITY TWENTY YEARS AGO AND WE

00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:37.002
ONLY DEVELOPED ON THREE QUARTERS

00:25:37.068 --> 00:25:37.636
OF IT SO MAYBE WE COULD PARCEL

00:25:37.702 --> 00:25:38.236
OFF THE OTHER QUARTER DEVELOP

00:25:38.303 --> 00:25:41.006
THEIR THOSE SORTS OF THINGS --

00:25:41.072 --> 00:25:44.809
BACK ON SCREEN DOWN TO ABOUT

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:45.443
THIRTEEN HUNDRED PARCELS ACROSS

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:46.111
THE STATE AND THE SCREENING TOOL

00:25:46.177 --> 00:25:49.014
I MENTIONED WAS AN APPLIED AND

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:49.681
SOCIAL TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT TOOL

00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:50.282
DOES AND HOW IT WAS USED IN A

00:25:50.348 --> 00:25:53.685
SECOND -- AND THEN WE TAKE THOSE

00:25:53.752 --> 00:25:54.286
THIRTY NINE THIRTY PARCELS AND

00:25:54.352 --> 00:25:57.255
YOU ACTUALLY GROUP THEM INTO

00:25:57.322 --> 00:25:57.856
SITES -- A LOT OF THEM WERE

00:25:57.923 --> 00:25:58.456
ADJACENT OR ACROSS THE STREET

00:25:58.523 --> 00:25:59.057
EACH OTHER SO WE WE STARTED

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:01.826
USING THE SITE TERMINOLOGY THERE

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:02.494
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.830
SO THAT NUMBER -- GOT BIGGER AND

00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:06.531
SMALLER -- OVER THE LAST COUPLE

00:26:06.598 --> 00:26:07.165
OF MONTHS AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:10.035
HAVE REACHED OUT AND ASKED US

00:26:10.101 --> 00:26:10.702
ABOUT SITE EXERCISE WHY -- THERE

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:14.139
ARE CERTAIN SITES FOR EXAMPLE

00:26:14.205 --> 00:26:14.739
THAT WE HAD TO DISCOUNTED ARE

00:26:14.806 --> 00:26:18.410
DISCARDED -- BUT THE LOCAL

00:26:18.476 --> 00:26:19.044
GOVERNMENT HAD MENTIONED HEY WE

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.347
ONLY JUST A PARTIAL AND SO MAYBE

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:22.914
YOUR SITE ISN'T A WHOLE BUT

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:23.515
TOGETHER IT IS AND SO -- THE

00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:26.518
NUMBERS FLEXED AND IT'S GONE UP

00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:27.152
AND GOING DOWN -- AND THEN THE

00:26:27.218 --> 00:26:27.686
THE DEPARTMENT VETTING HAS

00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:30.855
OCCURRED AND SO AFTER -- IT

00:26:30.922 --> 00:26:31.456
LIMITING THE SIZE I HAVE THE

00:26:31.523 --> 00:26:34.826
BILLS ENCUMBRANCES THAT -- HOW

00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:35.360
THE LEGITIMATE -- FUTURE

00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:35.894
UTILIZATION -- OR OTHER

00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:39.264
RESTRICTIONS WE ARE DOWN TO

00:26:39.331 --> 00:26:39.931
ABOUT A HUNDRED SITES STATEWIDE.

00:26:39.998 --> 00:26:51.509
THAT NUMBER WILL ALSO FLEX -- UP

00:26:51.576 --> 00:26:52.177
AND DOWN WE HAVE -- SOME APPEALS

00:26:52.243 --> 00:26:52.744
FRANKLY THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

00:26:52.811 --> 00:26:55.714
GOING THROUGH A DEPARTMENTS --

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.348
BUT AND SOME OF THOSE SITES ARE

00:26:56.414 --> 00:26:56.915
GONNA NATIONALLY SLOUGH OFF

00:26:56.982 --> 00:27:00.251
MEANING WE WE LOOK AT THEM THAT

00:27:00.318 --> 00:27:00.785
AVAILABLE MIGHT BE PROPER

00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:01.052
HOUSING.

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:01.720
BUT THEY BE REALLY REALLY REALLY

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:04.055
REALLY HARD TO DO IS MAYBE THOSE

00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:04.723
WILL NATURALLY FALL OFF OR GOING

00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:05.390
OUT TO KIND OF SEE LIKE GOES BUT

00:27:05.457 --> 00:27:08.393
FOR RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT ABOUT A

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.027
HUNDRED SITES THAT WE'RE LOOKING

00:27:09.094 --> 00:27:09.694
AT AND THE NEXT LIGHT HERE GIVES

00:27:09.761 --> 00:27:10.028
YOU A SENSE.

00:27:10.095 --> 00:27:12.564
FOR JUST THE SCOPE -- THIS IS

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:13.198
SAN DIEGO COUNTY THIS IS EVERY

00:27:13.264 --> 00:27:13.865
STATE ON PARCEL IN THE COUNTY --

00:27:13.932 --> 00:27:16.468
YOU CAN GET A SENSE FOR JUST

00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:17.035
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:27:17.102 --> 00:27:17.502
THINGS THAT ARE IN.

00:27:17.569 --> 00:27:20.939
URBAN AREAS THAT CERTAIN THINGS

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:21.573
THAT ARE RURAL AREAS THINGS THAT

00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:22.207
ARE YOU KNOW PARKS LAND FORCE

00:27:22.273 --> 00:27:22.841
LAND THINGS LIKE THAT -- SOME

00:27:22.907 --> 00:27:25.076
NATIONALLY SCREEN THEMSELVES OUT --

00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:25.744
THIS NEXT LIGHT IS AN EXAMPLE TO

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:29.414
SACRAMENTO -- THIS IS A SITE --

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:33.385
JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL

00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:34.019
CAPITAL THAT BIG PARK AREA OF

00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:37.355
IT'S ACTUALLY A TGS -- OWN SITE

00:27:37.422 --> 00:27:38.023
IT'S A PARKING LOTS AND THERE IS

00:27:38.089 --> 00:27:41.793
A SMALL -- COMPLEX THERE THAT

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:42.360
USUALLY USE USE USE -- FOR

00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:46.231
EVENTS SO WE'RE WE'RE INTERESTED

00:27:46.297 --> 00:27:46.865
IN TAKING A SITE MAKING -- VIA

00:27:46.931 --> 00:27:47.532
AN EXAMPLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:50.502
EASY CENTS FOR KIND OF WHAT WE

00:27:50.568 --> 00:27:51.102
HAD TO GO THROUGH VERSES THE

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.770
SIZE THAT WE'RE SEEING SOME OF

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:54.172
THE SITES ARE ACTUALLY QUITE

00:27:54.239 --> 00:27:58.309
LARGE WE'VE GOT -- SITES

00:27:58.376 --> 00:27:58.910
ADJACENT TO PRISONS OR STAY

00:27:58.977 --> 00:28:02.580
HOSPITALS THAT ARE YOU KNOW

00:28:02.647 --> 00:28:03.214
SAFELY AWAY BUT VERY AVAILABLE

00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:06.951
AND WE HAVE TYPE URBAN SITES

00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:15.060
LIKE THIS AS WELL -- SO NOW TO

00:28:15.126 --> 00:28:15.593
RESOLVE TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.027
SCREENING CRITERIA.

00:28:16.094 --> 00:28:19.064
HI AND SOCIAL SAKE I AM THE DATE

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.697
IN RESEARCH MANAGER FOR HOUSING

00:28:19.764 --> 00:28:20.298
POLICY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:20.765
HOUSING AND COMMUNITY

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:21.099
DEVELOPMENT.

00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:21.733
AND WE'VE BEEN REALLY FORTUNATE

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.501
TO GET TO WORK WITH DTS IN A

00:28:23.568 --> 00:28:24.069
REALLY GREAT PARTNERSHIP IN

00:28:24.135 --> 00:28:24.736
SHORT TIMING -- TO GET THIS DONE

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:27.639
SO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ASKED THE

00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:28.173
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND

00:28:28.239 --> 00:28:28.807
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO FOCUS

00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:32.143
ON TWO COMPONENTS TO SCREENING

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.811
TOOLS HIGHLIGHTED ON THE SLIDES

00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:35.814
AS HOUSING NEED.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.381
AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY THE

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:37.048
TALK ABOUT THEM QUICKLY BUT TALK

00:28:37.115 --> 00:28:39.884
ABOUT THE DATA THAT'S BEHIND

00:28:39.951 --> 00:28:40.085
THEM.

00:28:40.151 --> 00:28:40.785
I AND SO FOR HOUSING NEED REALLY

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:44.222
THERE WERE JUST TRYING TO SEE

00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:44.923
WHERE HOUSING IS MOST NEEDED AND

00:28:44.989 --> 00:28:48.526
MOST IMPACTFUL AS DESIGNED AND

00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:48.760
AN IO.

00:28:48.827 --> 00:28:49.360
SO WE LOOK AT AVAILABILITY OF

00:28:49.427 --> 00:28:52.530
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:28:52.597 --> 00:28:53.131
GAP BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND

00:28:53.198 --> 00:28:53.832
AND THE RATE OF INCREASE IN RENT.

00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:56.968
SO FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF

00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:57.402
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:28:57.469 --> 00:28:57.969
WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW MUCH

00:28:58.036 --> 00:29:01.005
HOUSING IS AVAILABLE IN THE JOB

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:01.673
AND COMMUTERS SHEDS SPECIFICALLY

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:05.076
WHERE THE SHORTFALL OF VERY LOW

00:29:05.143 --> 00:29:05.410
INCOME UNITS.

00:29:05.477 --> 00:29:06.111
EXCEEDS 30% OF THE NEED SO WE'RE

00:29:06.177 --> 00:29:09.581
REALLY TRYING TO GET AT FOR VERY

00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:10.215
LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IS THERE

00:29:10.281 --> 00:29:10.582
ENOUGH HOUSING.

00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:13.718
THAT'S THE FIRST MEASURE THE

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:14.285
SECOND BEING THE GAP BETWEEN

00:29:14.352 --> 00:29:17.722
SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND HERE WE

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:18.389
RELY ON SOME OF THE NUMBERS THAT

00:29:18.456 --> 00:29:18.590
ARE.

00:29:18.656 --> 00:29:22.093
PROJECTED AGAINST THE REGIONAL

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:22.794
HOUSING NEED ALLOCATION WHICH IS

00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:26.030
A TOPIC THAT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:26.664
PRESENTATION TO REALLY COVER BUT

00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:27.232
JUST TO SAY THAT THERE ARE

00:29:27.298 --> 00:29:30.235
PLANNING GOALS SET. FOR EACH

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:30.869
REGION AND FOR EACH CITY WITHIN

00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:34.272
REGIONS AND SO WE LOOK AT WHERE

00:29:34.339 --> 00:29:34.873
THE GAP BETWEEN THE REGIONAL

00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:38.409
HOUSING NEED ALLOCATION.

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:39.077
AND THE BUILDING PERMITS ISSUED

00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:39.711
IS GREATER THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED

00:29:39.777 --> 00:29:42.847
SO WHERE WE START SEEING THERE'S

00:29:42.914 --> 00:29:43.414
NOT ENOUGH ACTIVITY ON THE

00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:43.815
PRODUCTION SIDE.

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:47.018
AND THEN THIRD WHERE THE RATE OF

00:29:47.085 --> 00:29:47.685
INCREASE IN RENT -- SPECIFICALLY

00:29:47.752 --> 00:29:50.889
WHERE THE MEDIAN GROSS RENT

00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:51.489
INCREASED BY MORE THAN 5%.

00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:55.260
YEAR OVER YEAR FROM TWENTY

00:29:55.326 --> 00:29:55.894
SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.264
DATA SOURCES FOR ALL OF THIS FOR

00:29:59.330 --> 00:29:59.898
USING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA.

00:29:59.964 --> 00:30:00.532
SO FOR EXAMPLE USING JUST THOSE

00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:03.635
THREE HOUSING NEED COMPONENTS

00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:04.335
THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO SHOWS THAT

00:30:04.402 --> 00:30:07.539
IN EACH OF THOSE MATTERS.

00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:08.106
THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO NEEDS

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:08.640
HOUSING I KNOW THAT'S NOT

00:30:08.706 --> 00:30:11.843
SURPRISING HERE BUT MARKING ON

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:12.544
EACH OF THOSE MEASURES THAT IS A

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:13.178
DEMONSTRATED NEED HERE SO THAT'S

00:30:13.244 --> 00:30:15.847
ONE COMPONENT.

00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:16.514
ON THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY THIS

00:30:16.581 --> 00:30:20.251
REALLY BUILD OFF OF THE ANALYSIS

00:30:20.318 --> 00:30:20.919
THAT CHASEN'S TEAM DID SO BEYOND

00:30:20.985 --> 00:30:21.553
VISUAL SIDE IDENTIFICATION AS

00:30:21.619 --> 00:30:24.489
FOR THINKING CAN'T ANYTHING

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:25.123
ACTUALLY GET BUILT THERE THAT'S

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.657
ONE COMPONENT OF ECONOMIC

00:30:25.723 --> 00:30:25.990
FEASIBILITY.

00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:28.726
FURTHER WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER

00:30:28.793 --> 00:30:32.564
MEASURES THAT MIGHT PROMOTE.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:33.164
OR THAT MIGHT MAKE IT POSSIBLE

00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:33.765
FOR A DEVELOPER TO SEEK OTHER

00:30:33.831 --> 00:30:37.001
FORMS OF SUBSIDY OR FUNDING --

00:30:37.068 --> 00:30:37.735
AND BY LOCATION OF THE PARCEL WE

00:30:37.802 --> 00:30:41.039
KIND OF KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

00:30:41.105 --> 00:30:41.706
THOSE SITES MAY BE COMPETITIVE.

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:42.340
AND SO FOR EXAMPLE WE LOOK AT

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:45.443
PROXIMITY TO JOB CENTERS.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:49.214
AND THERE WERE THE NUMBER OF

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:49.781
WORKERS WITH LESS THAN A A

00:30:49.847 --> 00:30:53.551
BACHELOR'S DEGREE -- FALL REALLY

00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:57.522
HIGH -- AWAY FROM HOW MUCH THE

00:30:57.589 --> 00:30:58.189
AVAILABILITY THERE IS -- AND SO

00:30:58.256 --> 00:30:58.856
WE GO FURTHER INTO PROXIMITY TO

00:30:58.923 --> 00:31:01.826
EDUCATION.

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:02.427
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ARE THERE

00:31:02.493 --> 00:31:02.860
SCHOOLS CLOSE BY.

00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:06.097
ARE THERE GOOD SCHOOLS CLOSE BY

00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:06.798
AND THERE WE USE SOME OF THE TAX

00:31:06.864 --> 00:31:07.432
CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE AND

00:31:07.498 --> 00:31:07.899
HOUSING AND COMMUNITY

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:10.401
DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY MAPS TO

00:31:10.468 --> 00:31:10.935
GET SOME OF THAT DATA.

00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:14.505
AND THE SAME THING WITH THE

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:15.073
PROXIMITY TO HIGH FREQUENCY

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:15.440
PUBLIC TRANSIT.

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:18.509
SO NOT ONLY.

00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:19.143
THE PROXIMITY OF A SITE WITHIN

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:19.677
THOSE THREE AREAS PROMOTE

00:31:19.744 --> 00:31:22.914
FEASIBILITY BUT ALSO HELPS MAKE

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:23.548
SURE THAT THE AFFORDABILITY OF

00:31:23.615 --> 00:31:26.718
THE HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION

00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:27.385
INDEX OR THAT THAT HOUSEHOLD MAY

00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:27.919
PAY IN THEIR HOUSING AND

00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:31.055
TRANSPORTATION COSTS.

00:31:31.122 --> 00:31:31.789
MIGHT BE LESS IF THE PERSONAL IS

00:31:31.856 --> 00:31:35.226
LOCATED IN THESE THREE AREAS.

00:31:35.293 --> 00:31:35.860
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:36.494
THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING BUT THAT

00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:39.330
IS TO SAY WERE ALSO EXPLORING

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:39.897
OTHER COMPONENTS OF ECONOMIC

00:31:39.964 --> 00:31:40.498
FEASIBILITY AS WE GET DEEPER

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:43.668
INTO THE ANALYSIS -- WITH THE

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:44.269
CREATION OF THE OPPORTUNITIES

00:31:44.335 --> 00:31:44.869
OWN PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE

00:31:44.936 --> 00:31:48.006
NOT USING THAT IS PRESCRIPTIVE

00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:48.606
BUT JUST ANOTHER CONSIDERATION

00:31:48.673 --> 00:31:52.310
SIMILAR WHETHER OR NOT A PARCEL

00:31:52.377 --> 00:31:52.810
IS AN AREA WHERE CLIMB

00:31:52.877 --> 00:31:56.080
INVESTMENTS COULD BE LEVERAGED.

00:31:56.147 --> 00:31:56.648
AND ALSO LOCAL SOURCES OF

00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:57.315
FUNDING AND ESPECIALLY AS WE GET

00:31:57.382 --> 00:32:00.218
INTO THAT LOCAL COORDINATION

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:00.785
WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT.

00:32:00.852 --> 00:32:01.419
SO JUST OTHER DETERMINANTS OF

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:04.555
FEASIBILITY OR THINGS THAT WE

00:32:04.622 --> 00:32:08.760
WILL BE CONTINUING TO EXPLORE --

00:32:08.826 --> 00:32:09.294
AND ONE OTHER NOTE AS I

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.930
MENTIONED YOU KNOW WAS WE TALK

00:32:12.997 --> 00:32:13.531
ABOUT HOUSING NEED WE JUST

00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:13.965
RECENTLY ISSUED OUR

00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:16.901
DETERMINATION OF WHERE

00:32:16.968 --> 00:32:17.568
JURISDICTIONS ARE AT IN MEETING

00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:18.102
THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEED

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:20.972
ALLOCATION.

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:21.572
AND IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND

00:32:21.639 --> 00:32:22.140
EIGHTEEN CITIES WITHIN THE

00:32:22.206 --> 00:32:25.643
COUNTY ONLY 10% OF JURISDICTIONS

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:29.380
ARE ON PACE TO MEET ALL OF THE

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:29.847
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS

00:32:29.914 --> 00:32:30.148
ALLOCATION.

00:32:30.214 --> 00:32:30.715
AND THAT'S IF WE TOOK THEIR

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:31.282
PROGRESS IN THEIR PLANNING

00:32:31.349 --> 00:32:33.951
PERIOD TODAY SO IT'S A VERY

00:32:34.018 --> 00:32:34.519
SMALL NUMBER AND CONSIDERING

00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:35.186
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT EIGHTEEN

00:32:35.253 --> 00:32:37.922
JURISDICTIONS. 10% IS NOT A

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:38.556
REALLY COMPELLING NUMBER HERE

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:41.993
YOU KNOW SO WE STILL HAVE A LONG

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:42.293
WAY TO GO.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:42.927
THIS IS NOT ONLY IN SAN DIEGO

00:32:42.994 --> 00:32:46.364
COUNTY THIS IS A STATE WIDE

00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:46.931
ISSUE I AM SO THE STATE OF

00:32:46.998 --> 00:32:50.201
FACTORS ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF

00:32:50.268 --> 00:32:50.835
THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE'RE

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:51.235
SEEING OR TRYING.

00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:54.539
TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION IN THOSE

00:32:54.605 --> 00:32:55.106
HIGH NEED AREAS [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:55.173 --> 00:32:59.110

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:02.747
ART SO WHERE WE GO FROM HERE SO --

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:03.381
ARE DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES IS

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:07.018
PRETTY SIMPLE -- THESE WOULD BE

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:07.652
STATE DEVELOPMENT SO WE'RE NOT

00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:08.186
PLANNING UNNECESSARILY ON

00:33:08.252 --> 00:33:08.820
CONCERT BLESSING PROPERTY ALL

00:33:08.886 --> 00:33:11.322
THAT THAT MAY HAPPEN TIME TO

00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.923
TIME IN THERE ARE NUMBER OF

00:33:11.989 --> 00:33:12.590
SURPLUS PROPERTIES ON OUR LIST

00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:15.626
AS WELL -- THEY WOULD BE STATE

00:33:15.693 --> 00:33:16.260
DEVELOPMENTS MEANING LONG TERM

00:33:16.327 --> 00:33:16.794
GROUND LEASES TO PRIVATE

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:19.864
DEVELOPERS -- WE WOULD LEVERAGE

00:33:19.931 --> 00:33:20.498
STATE PROPERTY VALUES FREE --

00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:23.735
ARE NOT HOLD ME LOOKING TO MAKE

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:24.369
RETURNS ON THESE DEVELOPMENTS

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:28.005
AND SO -- HAPPY TO TO TO MAKE

00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:28.606
THOSE VERY VERY LOW AND VERY

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:32.143
LONG TERM GROUND LEASES -- AND

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.744
THEN WE DO WANT TO FOCUS ON

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:33.244
INNOVATIVE CONSTRUCTION

00:33:33.311 --> 00:33:36.381
TECHNIQUES -- WHETHER THAT

00:33:36.447 --> 00:33:37.081
SMUGGLER PREFAB CLT MICRO UNITS --

00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:40.718
WHATEVER WE CAN DO OLD EMILY --

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:41.352
TO TO DRIVE NOT JUST INNOVATION

THE SPEAR BUT ALSO MAKE THESE TO

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:45.323
BUBBLE FASTER QUICKER -- AND

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.893
CHEAPER -- WITH LIKEWISE LOOK

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.560
MAKING SURE THAT THESE ARE NONE

00:33:49.627 --> 00:33:52.697
THE LESS ATTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTS --

00:33:52.764 --> 00:33:53.364
AND EQUITABLE TO THERE'S A FOCUS

00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:53.931
ON PREVAILING WAGE AND AND

00:33:53.998 --> 00:34:01.239

EXECUTIVE ORDERS WELL.

00:34:01.806 --> 00:34:02.306
AND THEN JUST A COUPLE OTHER

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:02.840
HIGHLIGHTS -- I THINK ARE

00:34:02.907 --> 00:34:05.576
RELEVANT EXECUTIVE ORDER DOES

00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:06.144
CALL OUT -- LAND SWAPS AS

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:06.778
POSSIBILITIES I MENTIONED THERE

00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:07.445
WERE A COUPLE OF LOCAL ENTITIES

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:09.947
THAT HAVE APPROACHED US -- ABOUT --

00:34:10.014 --> 00:34:13.718
CO DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL WE ARE

00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:14.352
MORE THAN HAPPY AND WE'VE WE'VE

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:15.019
EXPRESS THIS WITH YOU KNOW HALF

00:34:15.086 --> 00:34:18.189
A DOZEN -- LOCALITIES ACROSS THE

00:34:18.256 --> 00:34:18.890
STATE TO LOOK AT INNOVATIVE WAYS

00:34:18.956 --> 00:34:21.959
OF DEVELOPING MAYBE OUR

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:22.593
PROPERTIES -- AREN'T GREAT --

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:26.697
BUT THERE'S NOT A LAND SWAP DEAL --

00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:27.231
WE COULD WE COULD COMBINE

00:34:27.298 --> 00:34:30.468
DEVELOPMENTS -- MAYBE IT'S MORE

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:31.135
OF A SALE MAYBE IT'S A SALE --

00:34:31.202 --> 00:34:31.803
IN THE PROCEEDS GO TO OFFSET OR

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:34.806
EVEN AFFORDABILITY SOMEWHERE

00:34:34.872 --> 00:34:35.440
ELSE MEAN WHERE WE REALLY WANT

00:34:35.506 --> 00:34:36.073
TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS FINE ALL

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:39.043
OPTIONS -- AND NOT LOOKING AT A

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:39.644
SINGLE WAY OF APPROACHING THE

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:43.114
SITES -- I DID MENTION ALL

00:34:43.181 --> 00:34:43.614
LEVERAGING STING SURPLUS

00:34:43.681 --> 00:34:44.115
PROPERTY -- ONE OF THE

00:34:44.182 --> 00:34:44.715
INTERESTING THINGS EXCITING

00:34:44.782 --> 00:34:47.318
THINGS ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:47.985
IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER

00:34:48.052 --> 00:34:51.122
OF SITES SOME PRETTY.

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:51.756
INTERESTING SITES OF THE STATE

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:52.356
HAS HAD FOR YEARS PAYING ONE

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:55.593
SHUT DOWN COST OF THIS EXECUTIVE

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:56.227
ORDER HAS SHAKEN LOOSE AND SO

00:34:56.294 --> 00:34:56.861
THERE ARE A FEW SITES THAT WERE

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:59.664
IN BEGIN WORKING ON IN A WAY

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:00.331
THAT -- WE HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO

00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:03.668
IN THE LAST DECADE OR SO -- AND

00:35:03.734 --> 00:35:04.335
LASTLY THERE IS -- SOME MENTION

00:35:04.402 --> 00:35:04.969
EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT POTENTIALLY

00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:08.105
PRIORITIZE FUNDING AS WELL

00:35:08.172 --> 00:35:12.343
THAT'S NOT -- DEFINED OR

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:12.977
FINALIZE THIS POINT BUT WE ARE

00:35:13.044 --> 00:35:13.611
LOOKING AND CAN'T OF EXPECTING

00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:16.681
TO BE ABLE -- TO TO REALLY DIG

00:35:16.747 --> 00:35:17.315
INTO THE SITES AND DO SOME NEXT

00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:24.889
BUT EITHER WAY IN THE NEXT

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:28.759
COUPLE OF MONTHS.

00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:29.393
ALL RIGHT ANY -- WITH THAT I

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:29.894
THINK WE'RE DONE ANY ANY

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:30.461
QUESTIONS I'M SURE THERE ARE

00:35:30.528 --> 00:35:32.864
TIMES.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:33.498
WHEN FIRST CASES SUCH THANK YOU

00:35:33.564 --> 00:35:37.168
FOR THE PREACHER TATIAN?

00:35:37.235 --> 00:35:37.702
I SHOULD SAY OUT THE BAD.

00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:41.472
I WAS OVERJOYED WHEN GOVERNOR

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:42.139
SOME PRACTICE EXECUTIVE ORDER --

00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:42.773
I THINK FOR A GOVERNOR WHO AND

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.877
EXPRESSLY CO HOUSING PLATFORM IT

00:35:45.943 --> 00:35:46.511
WAS REFRESHING NOT JUST TO SEE

00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:47.178
THIS GUY CAN WATER GO OUT BUT TO

00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:49.814
GO OUT SO EARLY IN HIS

00:35:49.881 --> 00:35:50.414
ADMINISTRATION I THINK STATE A

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:50.648
TEMPO.

00:35:50.715 --> 00:35:51.215
THE STATE'S COUNTRY A TRUE

00:35:51.282 --> 00:35:54.218
LEADER ON THIS ANYBODY BUT THOSE

00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:54.886
OF US FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHO

OFTEN FEEL AS OF THE STATE I

00:35:58.189 --> 00:35:58.789
KNOW IS TO BE ANY STUFF OF US --

00:35:58.856 --> 00:36:02.193
THIS IS A I THINK SYMBOLIC THAT

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:02.793
THE STATE IS WILLING TO WALK

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:03.427
IT'S ONE O'CLOCK RIGHT -- THAT

00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:03.961
THEY'RE GONNA BE PART TO

00:36:04.028 --> 00:36:06.297
PARTNERS OF PARTICIPANTS IN

00:36:06.364 --> 00:36:06.931
TRYING TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS SO

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:07.498
CERTAINLY KUDOS TO GOVERNOR

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:10.334
NEEDS SOME -- FOR NOT ONLY

00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:11.002
IDENTIFYING THIS AS FOR WHAT IT

00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:11.636
IS WHICH IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM

00:36:11.702 --> 00:36:12.236
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA --

00:36:12.303 --> 00:36:14.772
BUT FOR ACTUALLY LEADING ON ON

00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:15.373
THAT AREA WE HAVE SOME MORE

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:16.007
CONTROLLED BY BECAUSE WE ON THE

00:36:16.073 --> 00:36:18.976
PROPERTY -- AND I WOULD DEFY

00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:19.477
ANYONE TO LOOK AT THIS

00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:20.077
PRESENTATION AND OUTCOME AWAIT

00:36:20.144 --> 00:36:20.711
THE REALLY IMPRESSED BY WHAT YOU

00:36:20.778 --> 00:36:22.813
ALL PUT TOGETHER IN A RELATIVELY

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.414
SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME -- YEAH

00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:23.981
THIS IS A FEW MONTHS TO BE

00:36:24.048 --> 00:36:27.018
ADMINISTRATION RIGHT SIX MONTHS

00:36:27.084 --> 00:36:27.585
BARELY MAYBE THERE ABOUT --

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:28.185
AGAIN I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY

00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:31.589
THOUGHTFUL ME BOTH IN TERMS OF

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:32.256
THE SCOPE OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:35.426
AS WELL AS THE TOOLS AND THE THE

00:36:35.493 --> 00:36:35.960
FILTERS THAT YOU PUT THIS

00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:36.227
THROUGH.

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:36.861
YEAH AND AND NOT A BRIEF AMOUNT

00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:40.064
OF TIME IT TOOK TO SCALE THE FOR

00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:40.565
THE FOLKS ARE TRYING TO

00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:41.165
UNDERSTAND I THINK I HEARD YOU

00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:43.968
MAKE MENTION JJ'S AND THAT.

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:44.502
IN AN AVERAGE YEAR YOU'RE

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:45.036
TALKING ABOUT ONE TO FOUR

00:36:45.102 --> 00:36:48.139
PROPERTIES MAYBE IN A YEAR.

00:36:48.205 --> 00:36:48.773
DO THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER YOU'RE

00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:49.373
CURRENTLY LOOKING AT ABOUT A

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.410
HUNDRED SITES IS THAT RIGHT.

00:36:52.476 --> 00:36:53.044
I MEAN SAID IT'S A PICTURE OF

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:53.678
THE SCALE OF WHAT CAN BE DONE

00:36:53.744 --> 00:36:56.614
HERE RELATIVE TO OUR HISTORIC

00:36:56.681 --> 00:36:57.248
PERFORMANCE WHICH I THINK IS IN

00:36:57.315 --> 00:36:57.949
KEEPING WITH THE SIZE THE CRISIS

00:36:58.015 --> 00:37:00.785
IN THE BEAUTY OF LIFE.

00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:01.385
CALIFORNIANS ARE DEALING WITH

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:13.164
SOME I I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC --

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:17.501
THE THERE WERE A NUMBER.

00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:21.339
I GET TO THIS HOUSE WHERE --

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:21.806
THREE EIGHT TERMS THE

00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:22.406
IMPLEMENTATION STEPS I BELIEVE

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:25.876
YOU'RE AT THE MIDDLE OF IT RIGHT

00:37:25.943 --> 00:37:26.344
BESIDE PRIVATIZATION.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:30.014
YEAH AND ALL OF THIS -- TO GET

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:34.118
THROUGH ALL THAT [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:34.385
COUNTING.

00:37:34.452 --> 00:37:35.052
SEVEN ALL SEVEN STEPS BY THE END

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:38.422
OF SEPTEMBER IS THAT YEAH NOT

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:39.056
NOT OLD SITES WILL BE DEVELOPED

00:37:39.123 --> 00:37:39.690
AT THE SAME TIME -- OBVIOUSLY

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:42.293
THE AND THERE'S THERE'S ONLY SO

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:42.893
MANY RESOURCES THAT WE HAD TO

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:43.461
ISSUE THESE ARE PEAS AND WE

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:44.128
DON'T ALSO SATURATE THE MARKET --

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:46.731
THE INITIAL OUR PEACE NEED TO GO

00:37:46.797 --> 00:37:47.264
OUT BUT IN SEPTEMBER -- WE

00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:47.832
IMAGINE THIS TO BE SOMETHING

00:37:47.898 --> 00:37:50.935
THAT TIME -- MOST OF THE SITES

00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:51.469
WE DO HAVE -- THEY'RE NOT

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:52.103
ENCUMBERED PERMANENTLY BUT THEY

00:37:52.169 --> 00:37:54.972
DO HAVE SOME SHORT TERM

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:55.606
ENCUMBRANCES -- AND SO -- LIKE

00:37:55.673 --> 00:37:56.173
FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW TO BE

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.377
ASSEMBLY BUILDINGS -- THAT YOU

00:37:59.443 --> 00:37:59.977
JUST YOU KNOW MODOC ADVISE ON

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:02.980
THE ON THE LIST -- AND SO.

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:03.614
THEY'LL TAKE AWHILE TO GET THE

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:04.281
GET THOSE GUYS OUT INTO -- THE

00:38:04.348 --> 00:38:04.915
LEAST MARKET ALTER LOCATIONS AND

00:38:04.982 --> 00:38:07.485
SO YES I DAY IN THERE AND THEY

00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:08.152
WILL BE A SENSE OF A PROGRESSION

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:08.419
IN THIS.

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:11.355
BUT YES OUR OUR FIRST TO GO FROM

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:15.726
SO IS.

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:16.093
IT'S BEEN LEFT.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:16.694
BUT IT I MEAN IT'S REMARKABLE

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:19.797
WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME STARTED

00:38:19.864 --> 00:38:20.464

TONS OF APPRECIATION -- IN TERMS

00:38:28.372 --> 00:38:28.939
THE ISSUES THAT ARE OF PEAS WE

00:38:29.006 --> 00:38:29.573
SAY THERE'S NO PROMISES OF THE

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.677
NUMBER OF OUR FEES THAT COME OUT --

00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:36.480
HE'S EVEN CURRENTLY AT ROUGHLY A

00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:37.114
HUNDRED ASSUMING THAT YOU KNOW

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:37.748
SPELL OUT FORTY OF THE REASONS

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:40.685
THAT YOU MENTIONED -- WHAT WE

00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:41.285
SHOULD EXPECT AND -- HUNDRED

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:44.755
ALRIGHT PEAS -- IN SEPTEMBER --

00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:57.368
IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING YEAH

00:38:57.435 --> 00:39:01.639
IT'LL BE LESS THAN A HUNDRED I

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:02.273
MEAN I I PROBABLY I HONESTLY I

00:39:02.339 --> 00:39:02.940
WOULD IMAGINE PROBABLY THE FIRST

00:39:03.007 --> 00:39:03.574
ROUND WILL BE BETWEEN THEM YOU

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:03.774
KNOW.

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:06.010
THREE ASH -- WOULD BE PLAY THE

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:06.610
PROBABLY THE THE THAN INITIALS

00:39:06.677 --> 00:39:09.780
ALTHOUGH -- AND THEN WILL TEST

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:10.414
THE WATERS AS WELL -- WE'RE NOT

00:39:10.481 --> 00:39:11.015
ENTIRELY SURE -- EXACTLY HOW

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:18.089
MANY RESPONSES WERE GOING TO GET

00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:18.756
THE THE FIRST LITTLE BIT TO SEE

00:39:18.823 --> 00:39:19.390
HOW IT GOES IN THE KIND OF WORK

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:22.359
OVER EXPERIENCING.

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:23.027
ISSUES RUN INTO WE MIGHT HAVE TO

00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:26.731
RETOOL OUR P. WITH MY THREE TO

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:27.364
OUR GROUND THESE ALL THAT WE'RE

00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:28.032
GOING TO WANT TO NOT GET TOO FAR

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:31.102
AHEAD OF OURSELVES AND JUST PULL

00:39:31.168 --> 00:39:31.535
BACK CONSIDERABLY.

00:39:31.602 --> 00:39:34.839
I DIDN'T OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

00:39:34.905 --> 00:39:35.339
ALWAYS THE RISK OF DOING

00:39:35.406 --> 00:39:35.940
SOMETHING WRONG SO YOU DON'T

00:39:36.006 --> 00:39:39.477
WANT TO PUT ON EVERYTHING ALL AT

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:43.080
ONCE EXACTLY SO IF YOU ISSUE

00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:43.681
YOUR FIRST ART P. SOMETIME IN

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:47.184
THE FALL WHEN WITH THE NEXT

00:39:47.251 --> 00:39:47.785
GROUP OF OUR PEACE GO OUT ANY

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:48.018
ADULT.

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:51.956
YEAH THAT'S A THAT'S A TASK OF

00:39:52.022 --> 00:39:52.423
THOSE SELF MANAGING A

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:55.926
COMPETITIVE PROCESS HE'LL BE IS

00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:56.560
THERE THE BAND WITH TO BE ABLE

00:39:56.627 --> 00:39:57.094
TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THE

00:39:57.161 --> 00:40:04.068
REMAINING. NINETY SEVEN CARS.

00:40:04.135 --> 00:40:04.635
OPPORTUNITIES IS IT WHAT'S

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:05.202
WHAT'S THE CONTINUAL PUSH TO

00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:08.405
MAKE SURE THAT THESE THESE

00:40:08.472 --> 00:40:12.443
PROPERTIES ARE BEING RELEASED IN.

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.077
AND PUT OUT OF FOR FOR INTEREST

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:16.514
SO I HAVE -- YEAH THE WHOLE

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.181
UNITS WHOSE DEDICATED PURPOSE IS

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:17.882
THE DISPOSITION STATE PROPERTY --

00:40:17.948 --> 00:40:21.185
INCLUDING LONG TERM DEVELOPMENTS --

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:24.955
IT'S NOT A HUGE UNIT LIKE I SAID

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:25.523
YOU KNOW FOR PROPERTIES YEAR

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:26.157
PLUS OR MINUS -- MOST OF THE

00:40:26.223 --> 00:40:29.260
DEALS THEY WORK ON OUR IN THE

00:40:29.326 --> 00:40:33.564
CONTEXT MUCH WORK OF THIS IS

00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:37.468
THAT'S GOING TO BE IF YOU KNOW

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:38.035
OVERLY ONEROUS WE MIGHT ASK

00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:41.505
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES -- BUT I

00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:42.173
THINK ULTIMATELY -- WE'RE STILL

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:45.843
KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE THAT

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:46.510
OUT YOU DISPLAY WHERE IT'S GOING

00:40:46.577 --> 00:40:47.178
WITH THIS MAKING SURE THAT YOUR

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:49.847
RESOURCE TO BE ABLE TO DO.

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:50.514
THIS WORK I MEAN IT'S A POOR TO

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:51.048
GET THESE WERE PROPERTIES

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:54.351
RELEASE BUT NO ONE WANTS TO DO A

00:40:54.418 --> 00:40:58.322
TAXPAYER GIVEAWAY -- SO -- IT'S

00:40:58.389 --> 00:40:58.989
A IT'S A DELICATE BALANCE BUT IF

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:02.560
PASSAGE PROLONG YOUR YOUR OB YOU

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:03.227
GOING ON IS A VERY SMART FASHION.

00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:03.828
I WOULD SUSPECT THAT YOU WILL

00:41:03.894 --> 00:41:04.295
LET US KNOW -- IT'S A

00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:06.764
MINISTRATION BUT THOSE ARE

00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:07.331
LEGISLATURE WHO WANT TO BE

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:10.868
SUPPORTED GOING TO THE SCREEN

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:11.302
TOOL IF I MAY UM.

00:41:11.368 --> 00:41:11.869
SUCH I BELIEVE YOU MENTIONED

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:15.139
THAT THE THE FIRST BULLET

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:15.773
HOUSING NEED THAT THE FOUR OF

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.043
THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.677
HOUSING IS MEASURED BY VERY LOW

00:41:19.743 --> 00:41:20.177
INCOME HOUSING AND DID I

00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:23.147
UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY.

00:41:23.214 --> 00:41:23.781
YES FOR EARLY BECAUSE OF THEIR

00:41:23.848 --> 00:41:24.348
AS OPPOSED TO LOW INCOME OR

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:27.585
MODERATE INCOME HOUSING.

00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:28.219
OKAY AND IT'S NOT TO SAY THERE'S

00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:28.853
NOT STILL A GAP THERE BUT WE'RE

00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:29.486
REALLY JUST FIRST PURPOSES OF

00:41:29.553 --> 00:41:31.755
MEASURING AND HAVING A

00:41:31.822 --> 00:41:32.356
CONSISTENT MEASUREMENT KNOWING

00:41:32.423 --> 00:41:35.793
THAT IT FOR NOT MEETING THE MOST

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:36.193
VERY LOW INCOME.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:36.861
OR SEEN TRICKLE OF FACTS AND ALL

00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:40.130
THE OTHER INCOME CATEGORIES

00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:40.698
GENERALLY FROM A LOOK AT THE

00:41:40.764 --> 00:41:44.235
DATA IN RECOGNIZING OF BACK TO

00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:44.869
THE LATTER YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S

00:41:44.935 --> 00:41:45.469
MANY OF THOSE RATHER DOES NOT

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:48.405
EXIST AND IF.

00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:52.409
HAVE BEST MAYBE REALLY FRAIL --

00:41:52.476 --> 00:41:53.043
SO YOU'RE USING THE METRIC OF

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:56.881
VERY LOW WHICH HAS A DEFINITION

00:41:56.947 --> 00:41:57.481
AS THE LATTER INDICATE -- AND

00:41:57.548 --> 00:42:00.851
THEN YOUR ANSWER WAS UP THESE

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:01.485
THREE SCREENS ROUSING THE CITY

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:05.022
THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO ACTUALLY

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:05.322
QUALIFIES.

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:05.956
AND I THINK YOU FOR THE MENTION

00:42:06.023 --> 00:42:09.693
THAT OF EIGHTEEN CITIES -- IN

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.327
THE IN THE COUNTY IT SOUNDS LIKE

00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:13.530
ONE OR TWO BABY.

00:42:13.597 --> 00:42:17.501
ON BASE.

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:18.168
PACE NOT WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN

00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:21.872
AND THEN MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

00:42:21.939 --> 00:42:22.539
TRIED TO RIGHTLY CLEAR POINT AND

00:42:22.606 --> 00:42:26.210
FIND OUT THE STATUS OF WOMEN

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:26.844
GROW BY THINK THEY MIGHT BE THE

00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:30.080
ONE YEAH I AM I BELIEVE THAT IT

00:42:30.147 --> 00:42:30.681
IS LIMÓN GROW -- BUT I HAVE

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:31.315
OTHER STATISTICS TO TO SHOW JUST

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:34.518
PERCENTAGES WITHIN THE COUNTY

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:35.185
BUT I HAD IT'S ALSO NOT GOOD --

00:42:35.252 --> 00:42:38.689
ONLY 84% OF JURISDICTIONS ARE

00:42:38.756 --> 00:42:39.323
MEETING THEIR VERY LOW FOR ARE

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:43.093
ON PACE TO ME THEY'RE VERY LOW

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.797
AND LOW TARGETS -- 90% ARE NOT

00:42:46.864 --> 00:42:47.498
MEETING THEIR MODERATE TARGETS --

00:42:47.564 --> 00:42:48.132
AND THIRTY TWO ARE NOT MEETING

00:42:48.198 --> 00:43:03.280
THEIR ABOVE

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:07.851
MODERATE TARGETS SO

00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:11.622
MOST AND THIS IS DIFFICULT TO

00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:12.323
WHAT WE SEE THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:12.957
IT IS EASIER GENERALLY EASIER TO

00:43:13.023 --> 00:43:16.193
BUILD AND FOR RESTRICTIONS ARE

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:16.794
PRIORITIZING ABOVE MARK ABOVE

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:19.997
MODERATE.

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:20.497
DEVELOPMENT FOR MARKET

00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:21.131
DEVELOPMENT RIGHT RIGHT TO THE

00:43:21.198 --> 00:43:24.401
HARD TO BUILD AND EVEN THE

00:43:24.468 --> 00:43:28.405
MIDDLE TO BUILD COAXING AND I

00:43:28.472 --> 00:43:29.006
THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:29.707
CLEAR THAT HE'S INTENDED TO DO --

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:32.710
BOTH CARROTS AND STICKS TO TO

00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:33.310
HELP ADDRESS THIS CRISIS CAN I

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:36.780
JUST ADD ONE THING TO JUST THIS

00:43:36.847 --> 00:43:37.381
THE SCREEN CRITERIA CERTAINLY

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:38.015
FOCUSING ON LOW INCOME BUT IT

00:43:38.082 --> 00:43:38.682
DOESN'T MEAN NECESSARILY THAT --

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:41.251
YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR ADULT MUCH

00:43:41.318 --> 00:43:41.952
REALLY FOCUSED THAT WAY EITHER --

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:42.586
IT IS A GOOD CLARIFICATION WE

00:43:42.653 --> 00:43:45.389
HAVE FOR EXAMPLE -- ONE

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:46.056
POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT DEAL -- IN

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:49.460
SAN JOSE WHICH WILL BE.

00:43:49.526 --> 00:43:50.094
THE FOCUS OF THE MIDDLE INCOME

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:50.427
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:43:50.494 --> 00:43:53.497
SEE YOU IN MY HEAD JASON BECAUSE

00:43:53.564 --> 00:43:54.031
I WANT TO MAKE SURE I MEAN

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:54.698
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE AT THE COMMITTEE

00:43:54.765 --> 00:43:57.568
FOR WORKING MIDDLE CLASS HOUSING

00:43:57.634 --> 00:43:58.035
RIGHT AND YOU KNOW.

00:43:58.102 --> 00:43:58.635
THAT WHILE THERE IS TREMENDOUS

00:43:58.702 --> 00:44:02.072
NEED I THINK THERE'S A LOWE'S

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:02.706
GONNA FOLKS SHOW US SHORTLY NAY

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:03.240
YEAH WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:06.010
PRODUCTION AND VERY LOW LOW

00:44:06.076 --> 00:44:06.677
INCOME WITH NEXT TO NOTHING IN

00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:06.977
THE MIDDLE.

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:07.578
AND MY HOPE WOULD BE THAT THE

00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:10.347
STATE'S LEAN IN ON THIS -- YEAH

00:44:10.414 --> 00:44:10.914
I WILL CONCERNS ABOUT THE

00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:11.615
VIABILITY OF THE MIDDLE CLASS IN

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:14.585
CALIFORNIA -- YEAH IN THE

00:44:14.651 --> 00:44:15.252
GOVERNOR IS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:15.853
AS WELL AND IF WE'RE GONNA BE

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:18.422
DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:19.123
THESE PROPERTIES ARE ASSETS THAT

00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:19.757
CAN ACCRUE TO THE BENEFIT OF

00:44:19.823 --> 00:44:22.793
WORKING MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.460
FOLKS GET EVERY SINGLE DAY GO TO

00:44:23.527 --> 00:44:24.094
A JOB PAY THEIR TAXES PLAY BY

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:26.997
THE RULES -- THEY NEED TO SEE

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:27.631
THE STATE SEES THAT HERE'S THAT

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:31.001
IS DOING SOMETHING FOR THEM --

00:44:31.068 --> 00:44:31.602
AND I HOPE THAT THIS EXERCISE

00:44:31.668 --> 00:44:32.269
WOULD BE A PART OF THAT AFTER AT

00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:35.239
THE RISK OF GETTING MYSELF IN

00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:35.906
TROUBLE -- YEAH THERE THERE'S A

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:36.507
NUMBER OF STATE INSTITUTIONS

00:44:36.573 --> 00:44:39.510
ACROSS THE STATE -- YOU KNOW

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:40.110
HOSPITALS VETERAN CENTERS YOU

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:43.480
KNOW IN YOUR BILL AND NAPA AND

00:44:43.547 --> 00:44:44.114
WE'VE GOT PRISONS IN FOLSOM AND

00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:44.715
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S PLACES

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:47.718
WHERE -- PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO

00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:48.385
COMMUTE LONG DISTANCES JUST TO

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:48.886
GO TO WORK AT THE STATE

00:44:48.952 --> 00:44:51.789
FACILITIES AND SO -- YOU KNOW A

00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:52.423
POSSIBILITY OF DOING SOMETHING

00:44:52.489 --> 00:44:53.057
THAT'S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AS

00:44:53.123 --> 00:44:56.193
WELL OR HOUSING FOCUSED AS WELL

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:56.827
ADDING IS IS YOU KNOW THE WHOLE

00:44:56.894 --> 00:44:57.261
TABLE FOR US YEAH.

00:44:57.327 --> 00:45:00.197
I LIKE THAT ANSWER.

00:45:00.264 --> 00:45:00.831
AND SO ONE COMPONENT TO I THINK

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:01.465
IS THAT WITH THE WE'LL SEE IN

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:04.334
THE FIRST ROUND OF ART PEAS AND

00:45:04.401 --> 00:45:04.968
WE REALLY WOULD HAVE WANTED TO

00:45:05.035 --> 00:45:05.536
LEAVE SPACE CREATIVITY FOR

00:45:05.602 --> 00:45:08.705
DEVELOPERS AND FOR LOCAL

00:45:08.772 --> 00:45:09.339
GOVERNMENT. TO COME TO THE TABLE

00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:09.973
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT SOLUTIONS

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.310
MAKE SENSE AND SO I THINK THAT

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:13.977
IS ALSO WHAT WILL BE LEARNING IN

00:45:14.044 --> 00:45:14.578
THE FIRST ROUND AND CONTINUE

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:17.147
GROUNDS IS WHAT CREATIVITY WE

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:17.347
ARE.

00:45:17.414 --> 00:45:18.015
NOT YOU KNOW THAT THE ONLY ONES

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:21.418
WITH GOOD IDEAS HERE AND WE

00:45:21.485 --> 00:45:37.701
WELCOME LOCAL SOLUTIONS ON TO

00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:41.738
COME UP WITH WHAT MAKES SENSE.

00:45:41.805 --> 00:45:42.372
I LOVE THAT I JUST TRY TO WRAP

00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:42.973
BUT THE LEVEL ON THE EDITOR.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:43.574
ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY FOR YOUR

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.176
SCREENING TOOLS ARE SENATE HIGH

00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:46.844
FREQUENCY PUBLIC TRANSIT HOW ARE

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:47.444
YOU DEFINING HIGH FREQUENCY.

00:45:47.511 --> 00:45:54.618
OF ITS ANY AREA WITHIN THE STATE

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:55.219
THE TEN WITH AND HAVE A WE'RE

00:45:55.285 --> 00:45:58.822
CONSIDERING WOULD BE THERE BUT

00:45:58.889 --> 00:45:59.423
WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A WAY TO

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.693
PROMOTE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY.

00:46:02.759 --> 00:46:03.260
NOT ONLY FOR THE DEVELOPER

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:03.760
BEFORE THE HOUSEHOLDS.

00:46:03.827 --> 00:46:06.964
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING THAT WAS

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.664
PARTY TESTIMONY WHICH IS SPOT ON

00:46:07.731 --> 00:46:08.332
I'VE GOT DEFINITION IS EXTREMELY

00:46:08.398 --> 00:46:11.268
IMPORTANT SENATOR WE DON'T I CAN

00:46:11.335 --> 00:46:11.902
SPEND A LOT OF TIME GOING BACK

00:46:11.969 --> 00:46:12.202
AND FORTH?

00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:12.803
WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF HIGH

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:15.439
FREQUENCY PUBLIC TRANSIT -- I

00:46:15.506 --> 00:46:16.073
THINK QUIRK A QUARTER MILE IN

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:19.376
FIFTEEN MINUTE HEADWAYS.

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:19.977
ABSOLUTELY QUALIFY THEY GOING

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:20.577
BEYOND THAT WE START TO REALLY

00:46:20.644 --> 00:46:23.714
STRETCH AND WE PROBABLY DO NEED

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:24.314
TO STRETCH THE THE SENATE THE

00:46:24.381 --> 00:46:24.982
SIZE AND SCALE OF CLIMATE CRISIS

00:46:25.048 --> 00:46:27.684
IS SO SIGNIFICANT WE PROBABLY

00:46:27.751 --> 00:46:28.085
NEED TO DO THAT.

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:28.685
HOWEVER I THINK FOR THE LIVED

00:46:28.752 --> 00:46:29.286
EXPERIENCE OF THE PEOPLE WERE

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:32.256
TRYING TO HOUSE THE FACT OF THE

00:46:32.322 --> 00:46:36.059
MATTER IS A QUARTER MILE AND AND

00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:36.660
SEVEN MINUTE FIFTEEN MINUTE.

00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:37.261
LOOK AT SHARON AND PAUL WHO I

00:46:37.327 --> 00:46:40.297
KNOW THAT A CHEAP TO DO THAT

00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:40.931
LOVED EVERY LEVEL OF FREQUENCY

00:46:40.998 --> 00:46:41.465
BUT THESE THINGS ARE ALL

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:44.535
CONNECTED WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY

00:46:44.601 --> 00:46:45.102
WE HAVE CLIMB AS OUR LAST.

00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:45.702
DISCUSSION THE LAST ROUND OF

00:46:45.769 --> 00:46:48.505
QUESTIONS IS SHAMELESS PROMOTION

00:46:48.572 --> 00:46:49.072
I THINK YOU MAY BE AWARE OF

00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:49.773
DOING ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN SIXTY

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.776
FOUR AROUND THE STATE BUILDING

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:53.377
HERE IN SAN DIEGO -- CAN YOU

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:53.944
COMMENT ON THAT IS IN THE

00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:57.147
LEGISLATION THAT'S NOT THAT'S

00:46:57.214 --> 00:46:57.814
NOT YOUR THAT'S FOR OTHER PEOPLE

00:46:57.881 --> 00:47:01.451
TO DO -- BUT CAN YOU -- LET US

00:47:01.518 --> 00:47:02.085
KNOW WHERE THAT PROPERTY MAY BE

00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:05.255
IN TERMS OF THE SCREEN AND THE

00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:05.722
RPM HAD TO PROCESS.

00:47:05.789 --> 00:47:06.423
YEAH I MEAN THAT -- IT'S IT'S A

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.560
IT'S A INTERESTING SITE AND

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:10.194
THAT'S NOT JUST A STATE OFFICE

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:10.827
BUILDING BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT

00:47:10.894 --> 00:47:11.328
ACROSS THE STREET WITH A

00:47:11.395 --> 00:47:13.997
CONDEMNED BUILDING AND THE OTHER --

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:14.598
ONE AND IT'S IT'S LITERALLY

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:17.901
FLANKED ON ALL SIDES BY. THIRTY

00:47:17.968 --> 00:47:18.569
STORY HIGH RISE BUILDINGS -- BUT

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:22.005
YES THAT WE DO WE ARE

00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:22.673
ANTICIPATING THAT BUILDING BEING

00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:30.314
ON OUR ACCESS LIST.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:34.351
LIKE THAT THE ANSWER.

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:34.918
YOU CAN IMAGINE -- THE THAT

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:35.619
ANGST I HAVE I KNOW WE'RE TRYING

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:36.286
TO PUSH LOCALITIES TO DO THAT WE

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:39.056
HAVE TO PULL CITY BLOCKS --

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:39.656
THERE'S OWN FOR HIGH DENSITY

00:47:39.723 --> 00:47:40.290
HOUSING -- WITH ONE SIX STORY

00:47:40.357 --> 00:47:43.060
BUILDING THAT IS SEEN FAR BETTER

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:43.594
DAYS AND AS YOU MENTION A

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.228
CONDEMNED BUILDING ON THE OTHER

00:47:44.294 --> 00:47:44.861
ONE DOESN'T SPEAK WELL FOR THE

00:47:44.928 --> 00:47:47.130
FOR THE STATE -- HOW TO SHARE

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:47.631
GETTING TOTALLY UP FOR

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:48.198
NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL THESE ARE

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:51.435
AREAS IS OUR BOX FOR A LOT OF

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:52.069
FUN COMMUNITY COMPLAINT -- IN

TERMS OF ILLEGAL LODGING --

00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:55.405
SMELL AND GARBAGE OTHER KINDS OF

00:47:55.472 --> 00:47:56.006
ISSUES -- TGS STAFF FOR DOING

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:56.573
THE VERY BEST THEY CAN TO

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.610
MITIGATE THAT BUT ULTIMATELY THE

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:00.244
BLIGHTED CONDITION THEY ARE ONLY

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:00.711
TRACKS MORE DEUCES.

00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:03.680
AND THE FACT THAT YOU COULD DO A

00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:04.381
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT HOUSING THERE --

00:48:04.448 --> 00:48:04.915
THIS IS IS THE IMPETUS THE

00:48:04.982 --> 00:48:08.385
DESIRED AND THEY'VE GOT -- SO WE

00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:08.919
BILL -- ELEVEN SIXTY FOUR

00:48:08.986 --> 00:48:12.289
INTRODUCED I'M NOT SURE WHERE

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:12.956
THAT I'M GLAD IT'S ON THE RADAR.

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:16.627
THERE WAS A REPORT WE PUBLISHED

00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:17.294
JUST A FEW MONTHS BACK -- THAT

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:20.597
THAT THE INDICATE WHICH

00:48:20.664 --> 00:48:21.198
BUILDINGS ACROSS OF A POLIO

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:21.798
STATEWIDE THAT WE WOULD BE

00:48:21.865 --> 00:48:24.801
DECLARING XSLT LONG TERM LOOKING --

00:48:24.868 --> 00:48:28.639
TO DISPOSITION -- THAT BUILDING

00:48:28.705 --> 00:48:29.239
AND THAT BOTH THOSE LAWS ARE

00:48:29.306 --> 00:48:29.873
DEFINITELY ON IT -- AND WE'RE

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:30.540
WE'RE HAPPY IN THE CONVERSATION

00:48:30.607 --> 00:48:37.247
ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S THE

00:48:37.314 --> 00:48:41.285
MOST APPROPRIATE THOSE LAWS -- I

00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:41.918
GOT ALL KINDS IDEAS -- QUICKLY

00:48:41.985 --> 00:48:45.389
GET SHE WAS PROMOTION -- THE

00:48:45.455 --> 00:48:45.922
EASY EIGHT HOTEL WHICH IS

00:48:45.989 --> 00:48:46.523
CURRENTLY -- INTERESTED IN THE

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:49.593
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION --

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:50.260
IN OLD TOWN EMILY JASON BELLTOWN

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:53.563
TRANSIT CENTER I DID LEGISLATION

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:54.164
TO ALLOW THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:54.798
TO UTILIZE THAT PROPERTY IF IT

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:55.399
IF IT DESIRED -- TO I THINK

00:48:55.465 --> 00:48:58.001
WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO TO

00:48:58.068 --> 00:48:58.602
EXTINGUISH THE LEAST THERE AND

00:48:58.669 --> 00:48:59.169
HAVE IT IS A NEW LIFE WE'RE

00:48:59.236 --> 00:48:59.703
HAVING TREMENDOUS SUCCESS

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.072
HOUSING HOMELESS PEOPLE IN FOR

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:02.673
THE MOTEL FACILITIES I THINK

00:49:02.739 --> 00:49:03.173
THIS IS A NO BRAINER.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:03.874
IT'S NEAR OUR COUNTY HEALTH CARE

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.510
SERVICES I MEAN IT'S JUST

00:49:06.576 --> 00:49:07.110
THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS WHERE

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:07.778
AGAIN LIKE THE STATE'S DOING ALL

00:49:07.844 --> 00:49:10.647
IT CAN TO BE A SOLUTION PROVIDER --

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:11.248
THE SOON TO BE VACATED SEAT

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:14.818
FACILITY ABOUT A BLOCK AWAY ON

00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:15.419
PACIFIC HIGHWAY -- IT'S NOT

00:49:15.485 --> 00:49:16.053
NECESSARILY A RESIDENTIAL AREA

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:18.689
BUT THAT MIGHT.

00:49:18.755 --> 00:49:19.256
ALLOW FOR USES THAT OTHER

00:49:19.323 --> 00:49:19.890
RESIDENTS NEIGHBORHOODS MAY NOT

00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:23.160
WANT -- AGAIN THAT'S A

00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:23.794
POSSIBILITY IN MY LAST AND I'M

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:24.328
THAT THIS ISN'T ACTUALLY

00:49:24.394 --> 00:49:27.464
QUESTION -- THE DMV IN HILLCREST --

00:49:27.531 --> 00:49:31.201
IS CURRENTLY SLATED FOR A

00:49:31.268 --> 00:49:31.835
REPLACEMENT -- SENATOR ATKINS

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:32.502
AND I HAVE BEEN THERE VOCAL AND

00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:35.639
NOT WANTING TO SEE THE STANDARD

00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:39.576
ISSUE SUBURBAN DMV ON THAT URBAN

00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:40.143
INFILL SITE NOT A STRAIGHT

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:40.811
TALKING ABOUT YEAH AND THE STAFF

00:49:40.877 --> 00:49:43.914
HAS BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE AND PUT

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:44.548
THE PROPOSED PROJECT ON ICE.

00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:47.984
THIS WOULD NOT BE ACCESS BECAUSE

00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:48.585
THE STATE STILL HAS A USE OF

00:49:48.652 --> 00:49:49.219
FORCE THAT WOULD REALLY BE PART

00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:52.089
OF YOUR PRESENTATION.

00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:52.656
TODAY BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:56.326
WHATEVER COMES BACK FROM THAT

00:49:56.393 --> 00:49:56.927
SORT OF INTERNAL PROCESSES ONE

00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:57.294
IS A MIXED USE.

00:49:57.361 --> 00:50:00.530
PROPERTY WITH A FULL SCALE DMV

00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:01.164
BUT WITH A BOATLOAD WORKFORCE

00:50:01.231 --> 00:50:04.768
HOUSING ON TOP OF IT -- WE AS A

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:05.435
COMMUNITY AS A STATE MR BLONSKY

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:06.103
IS RUNNING HIGH FREQUENCY PUBLIC

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:09.239
TRANSIT A BLOCK AWAY -- THIS IS

00:50:09.306 --> 00:50:09.840
A COMMUNITY THAT'S CURRENTLY

00:50:09.906 --> 00:50:13.076
RENT YOU KNOW IN IN THIRTY MORE

00:50:13.143 --> 00:50:13.577
INFILL -- SEVERAL STORY

00:50:13.643 --> 00:50:14.244
BUILDINGS THERE THE COMMUNITY IS

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:17.447
ACCEPTING OF THIS WHICH GOOD

00:50:17.514 --> 00:50:17.981
LUCK FINDING THAT A LOT OF

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:21.385
PLACES -- SO IT JUST SEEMS TO ME

00:50:21.451 --> 00:50:22.052
THIS IS A NO BRAINER I'M REALLY

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:57.280
ALREADY LOOKING FOR WAYS AS WE

00:51:57.347 --> 00:51:57.848
DEVELOP OUR PROPERTY OVER

00:51:57.914 --> 00:52:01.451
WHETHER IT'S PARK AND RIDE SITES

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:02.018
OR OTHER SURPLUS PROPERTY.

00:52:02.085 --> 00:52:02.686
TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT IS

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:05.755
GOING BUT ONLY IF IT GENERATES

00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:06.223
WRITERS TO TRANSIT.

00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:06.890
AND AND I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:09.793
IN SOME OF OUR DEVELOPMENTS IN A

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:10.460
BIT MARKET RATE HOUSING -- WE

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:11.094
DON'T GET AS MUCH AS WE WOULD

00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:14.397

VALLEY AND PLACES LIKE THAT THAT

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:19.135
YOU WOULD THINK GENERATE A LOT.

00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:22.272
BUT PEOPLE WORKING SORRENTO AND

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:22.939
OTHERS AND AND THEY DON'T REALLY

GREATER USE OF TRANSIT AND I

00:52:35.185 --> 00:52:35.819

GOOD TESTIMONY AS TO WHAT.

00:54:19.155 --> 00:54:19.356
THEY ARE.

00:54:19.422 --> 00:54:19.956
OF OUR POLICY EIGHTEEN IS THE

00:54:20.023 --> 00:54:23.560
POLICY THAT HAS -- KIND OF

00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:24.160

DEVELOPMENT IN DEVELOPMENT ON

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:27.897
OUR PROPERTY.

00:54:27.964 --> 00:54:28.498
AND WE RECENTLY MADE SOME

00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:31.768
CHANGES TO IT OVERALL THE POLICY

WOULD BE IN THE VERY LOW AND LOW

00:54:53.657 --> 00:55:00.830

RELATED TO THIS.

00:55:18.214 --> 00:55:21.718
THE BOARD AT ITS NEXT MEETING

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:22.285

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:51.247
GREAT LOCATION GREAT VISIBILITY

ARE ACTUALLY DEVELOP MOBILE AND

00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:03.993
THE REST WILL EITHER GO TO HELP

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:07.363
RUNOFF CREEK DEVELOPMENT OR THE

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:08.031
TRANSIT CENTER ITSELF IS THERE.

00:56:08.098 --> 00:56:08.631
THIS IS AN INTERESTING PROJECT

00:56:08.698 --> 00:56:11.835
BECAUSE OF THOSE DEVELOPER WE

00:56:11.901 --> 00:56:12.435
SPLIT THOSE UP WE HAVE TO

00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:15.739
DEVELOPERS WORKING IT GRAY STAR --

00:56:15.805 --> 00:56:16.339
IT AS WELL AS AFFIRMED AGREE

00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:19.943
STAR IS GOING TO DEVELOP A

00:56:20.009 --> 00:56:20.610
MARKET RATE PRODUCT -- BASICALLY

00:56:20.677 --> 00:56:21.211
SHOULD A STUDENT MARKET RATE

00:56:21.277 --> 00:56:24.514
HOUSING -- THAT'S GOING TO GO IN

00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:25.148
THERE A FIRM JUST GONNA DO A

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:28.351
HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX UNITS OF

00:56:28.418 --> 00:56:28.785
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:32.489
IN THE FORTY SIXTY AND 80% OF A

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:33.156
AYE MINE -- ALL TOTAL WILL HAVE

00:56:33.223 --> 00:56:36.960
OVER A THOUSAND RESIDENTS AT

00:56:37.026 --> 00:56:37.327
THAT LOCATION.

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:40.964
AND THE REVENUE THAT WE GENERATE

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.664
FROM THE MARKET RATE ONE HE IS --

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:45.301
IT IS IS GOING TO HAVE PROBABLY

00:56:45.368 --> 00:56:46.002
HELP WITH TRANSIT PASSES -- WERE

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:49.506
REALLY GOING TO TRY TO STIMULATE

00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:49.806
RIDERSHIP.

00:56:49.873 --> 00:56:50.473
UNDERSTAND THOUGH THAT WHEN WE

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:53.743
ENTER INTO THE AFFORDABLE --

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:57.614
ARENA AS OPPOSED TO MARKET RATE.

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.248
OF THEN LIKELY WE'RE GOING TO

00:56:58.314 --> 00:57:01.718
GIVE UP SOME SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:02.352
IN IN DOING THAT AND THE RATE

00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:02.685
DIFFERENCES.

00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:06.122
OR THE RETURN TO MTS -- BETWEEN

00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:06.790
THESE TWO DEVELOPMENTS IS FAIRLY

00:57:06.856 --> 00:57:10.326
SUBSTANTIAL BUT WE'RE HOPING

MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO CREATE

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.530
HOUSING THAT'S MARKETABLE

01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:35.164
THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE --

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:38.434
SUBSIDIES AND WE'RE PROBABLY

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:38.968

HARDER TO MAKE THINGS WORK.

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:12.068

ALONG THESE LINES IT'S JUST

01:05:57.253 --> 01:05:57.853
CERTAINLY HELPFUL TO SHOW PEOPLE

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.955
WHAT THIS CAN LOOK LIKE WHAT IS

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:00.556
THE MIDDLE INCOME STUFF FROM

PORTIONS OF THAT WE ONLY YEAH

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:16.806
THAT'S THAT'S COMPLEX STORY

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:17.473
RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S A BUNCH OF

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:18.107

THING THAT WE ALL GET OUT I

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:34.924
DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN -- THAT

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:37.526
WILL BE DEVELOPED BUT NOW AT

01:06:37.593 --> 01:06:38.127
LEAST WE HAVE ACCESS TO THAT

01:06:38.194 --> 01:06:41.664
PROPERTY THROUGH THE RIVER WALK

01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:42.298
DEVELOPMENT BEFORE THAT WAS A

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:42.598
LANDLOCKED.

01:06:46.635 --> 01:06:50.072
WE'VE HAD THE DEVELOPERS AND I

01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:50.740
DON'T KNOW HALF A DOZEN TIMES --

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:54.143
TO TALK TO THEM SO WE'LL JUST

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:54.744
HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE ON THAT.

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:58.280
HOW DOES CONVERSATION KEEP GOING?

01:06:58.347 --> 01:06:58.848
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WITH THE

01:06:58.914 --> 01:06:59.415
LARGEST CASH ABOUT FUTURE

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:00.082
STATIONS EITHER THOSE ARE CREDIT

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:02.651

LOOKING AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:06.522
HAD INVENTORY OF EXISTING

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:07.156
STATIONS BY THINK ABOUT SOME OF

01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:10.659
THE MOST UNDER UTILIZED ONES --

01:07:10.726 --> 01:07:11.293

MAYBE THE POOR DISTRICT ENDING I

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:16.265
THINK SOME OF YOUR STATIONS ARE

01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:16.832
SURROUNDED CLOSE ENOUGH TO

01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:19.268

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:19.902
OVER THIS ONGOING CONVERSATION

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:20.536
OF PUBLICLY OWNED PROPERTIES.

01:07:20.603 --> 01:07:23.272
FOR WHICH THE PUBLIC COULD USE A

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:23.939
GREATER BENEFIT -- AND THAT YOU

01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:27.176

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:36.118
STAKE THE U. HAPPY ON THE

01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:39.789
STATION -- YOU KNOW.

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:40.423

CAN WE CAN WE GET SOMETHING MORE

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:44.960
AT THAT STATION THAT WOULD BE

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:48.063
TRANSIT ORIENTED -- YOU KNOW THE

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:48.697
YOU YOU CATCH MY DRIFT AND YEAH

LOOKING AT THOSE EXISTING

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:52.368
STATIONS NOT AND AND NOT

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:53.002

VERY -- DATE PRESIDENT MINE --

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:57.506
BUT GOING BACK TO CITIES

01:07:57.573 --> 01:08:00.943
EXISTING STATIONS WHERE MORE CAN

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:01.544
BE DONE I THINK IS THE RIGHT

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:01.811
APPROACH.

01:08:01.877 --> 01:08:05.247

WE RUN TRANSIT.

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:13.489
BUT EVEN WHEN I SEE DEVELOPMENTS

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:14.190

THAT DECLINE THAT HAS HAPPENED

01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:49.618
SEVERAL DECADES LATER AND

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:50.252
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A NUMBER OF

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:53.589
REASONS AND AVAILABILITY OF LAND

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:54.223

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:10.272
THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:14.143
MIGHT HAVE CONTRIBUTED.

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.610
TO AND THESE NUMBERS.

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:15.277
I'LL MAKE THAT SIDE FOR THE NEXT

01:10:15.344 --> 01:10:18.447
PRESENTATION -- THIS THOUGH

01:10:18.514 --> 01:10:19.114
REALLY DEMONSTRATES THE GAP THAT

01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:22.451
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SO

01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:23.085
THE MODERATE OR MIDDLE INCOME

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:26.689
REALLY STANDS OUT I MEAN JUST TO

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:27.323
HAVE A CONVOLUTED EUROS -- AND

01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:30.793
THAT BEING THE LOWEST PERCENTAGE

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:31.393
OF OUR REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:32.027
ASSESSMENT THAT AND WE'VE SEEN

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:35.064
ACHIEVED IT THEN THE CITY.

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:35.631
IT'S JUST IT'S JUST MIND

01:10:35.698 --> 01:10:39.134
BOGGLING AND WE REALLY DO WANT

01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:39.735
TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS WITHIN

01:10:39.802 --> 01:10:40.402
THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO BECAUSE IF

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:43.906
WE CAN REDUCE THE PRESSURE -- ON

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:47.643
THE AFFORDABLE UNITS BY OPENING

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:48.310
UP MORE AND MIDDLE INCOME UNITS

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:48.911
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE FOLKS

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:52.114
THAT HAVE THE INCOMES THAT CAN

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:52.748
MOVE INTO THAT. EIGHTY EIGHT

01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:56.185
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TO A 120% AND

01:10:56.251 --> 01:10:56.919
MY AND SO -- WILL BE ABLE TO GET

01:10:56.986 --> 01:11:00.389
MORE PEOPLE ON AFFORDABLE UNITS

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:04.093
IF WE INCREASE THESE NUMBERS --

01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:04.627
SO WHAT ABOUT THE PERMIT

01:11:04.693 --> 01:11:08.430
STREAMLINING ACT WHAT DOES THIS

01:11:08.497 --> 01:11:09.131
DO WELL THIS IS A STATE ACT THAT

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:12.668
REQUIRES LOCAL AGENCIES SUCH AS

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:13.235
MY OWN TO MAKE DECISIONS ON

01:11:13.302 --> 01:11:13.736
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:17.139
OR ON A QUASI JUDICIAL AND USE

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:20.843
DECISIONS WITHIN SPECIFIED TIME

01:11:20.909 --> 01:11:21.443
MOMENT AND IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:22.044
CREATE CERTAINTY BOTH FOR THE

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:25.280
DEVELOPER -- AND TO GETTING

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:25.914
THEIR PROJECT APPROVED -- AND

01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:29.585
THEN ALSO FOR CITIES TO GIVE US

01:11:29.652 --> 01:11:30.252
SOME TOOLS IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:33.822
WORK I AM SO REALLY YOU KNOW.

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:34.423
WHAT COULD HAPPEN WITHIN THE

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:37.459
PERMIT STREAMLINING ACT IS THAT

01:11:37.526 --> 01:11:38.060
IF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO OR

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:38.694
DEVELOPMENT SERVICES FAILS TO

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:42.031
ACT WITHIN CERTAIN TIME LIMITS

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:42.631
IT COULD RESULT IN A PROJECT

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:45.968
APPLICANT COMING IN AND JUST

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:46.301
ALTERNATELY?

01:11:46.368 --> 01:11:49.938
BEING DEEMED APPROVED AN

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:50.572
AUTOMATIC APPROVAL THE PROJECT

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:51.073
IT SOUNDS GREAT AND AND

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:54.343
EVERYONE'S DREAM EXCEPT FOR THE

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:55.044
FOLKS THAT WANT TO ENSURE THAT --

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:58.347
SAFETY OF THE BUILDING AND THAT

01:11:58.414 --> 01:11:58.981
ADHERENCE TO LAND USE PLANS AND

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:02.551
AND OTHER REGULATIONS -- IT'S

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:03.185
IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT PERMITS

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:06.755
STREAMLINING THOUGH BECAUSE AS I

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:07.423
MENTIONED BEFORE ABOUT DIFFERENT

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:11.093
THAT COST INPUTS AND REASONS WHY

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:11.627
HOUSING GETS EXPENSIVE I

01:12:11.694 --> 01:12:15.330
DECIMATED THAT. 3240% OF THE

01:12:15.397 --> 01:12:15.964
COST OF EVERY UNIT REALLY IS

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:23.605
THAT I'M REGULATION AND AND TIME

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:23.906
TO PROCESS.

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:24.073
SO.

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:27.810
WHAT THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO IS

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:28.377
DONE IS PROVIDED -- INDEPTH

01:12:28.444 --> 01:12:29.044
REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR SAID MIDDLE

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:32.114
PROCESS AND FOR APPLICATIONS SO

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:32.648
THAT WE DON'T EVER FIND

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:36.018
OURSELVES IN THIS POSITION SO WE

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:36.585
FRONT LOAD THE INFORMATION.

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:39.955
AND I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT --

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:40.622
THIS IS MORE OF A PROFIT RATHER

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:41.256
THAN A HAND OUT BUT THIS IS A

01:12:41.323 --> 01:12:44.593
THIRTEEN PAGE MANUAL THAT WE'VE

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:45.160
CREATED JUST TO GUIDE YOU

01:12:45.227 --> 01:12:48.831
THROUGH THAT PROJECTS THE MIDDLE

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:49.164
REQUIREMENTS.

01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:49.832
THIS ISN'T EVEN THE REQUIREMENTS

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:53.001
THEMSELVES THIS IS THE THIRTEEN

01:12:53.068 --> 01:12:53.669
PAGE MANUAL HOW TO GET THERE ARE

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:56.905
REQUIREMENTS SO -- WE REALLY

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:57.539
DELVED INTO THE DETAILS TO HELP

01:12:57.606 --> 01:13:01.009
APPLICANTS UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING

01:13:01.076 --> 01:13:01.577
THAT THEY NEED TO GIVE US

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:02.211
BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:02.778
LOOK AT YOUR APPLICATION AND

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:05.114
DEMAND COMPLETE.

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:05.781
SO THAT WE DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:09.752
AND IT DOESN'T GET AUTOMATICALLY

01:13:09.818 --> 01:13:10.018
APPROVED.

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:10.586
THE THING ABOUT THE PERMIT

01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:13.689
STREAMLINING ACT THAT IS

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:14.256
IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT.

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:17.993
THERE'S STILL A KEEN NOTICING

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:18.694
REQUIREMENT SO HAVING THE PUBLIC

01:13:18.761 --> 01:13:22.064
UNDERSTAND THAT IF -- IT

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:22.664
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THEIR

01:13:22.731 --> 01:13:26.135
APPLYING FOR A ZONE CHANGE OR OR

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:26.769
SOMETHING THERE THERE ARE STILL

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:30.172
PUBLIC NOTICE REQUIREMENT THAT

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:30.806
HAVE TO KEEP THE GENERAL PUBLIC

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:31.340
INFORMED ABOUT THESE QUASI

01:13:31.406 --> 01:13:34.343
JUDICIAL DECISIONS.

01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:34.977
AND FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN THE

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:35.644
EVALUATION THAT I'VE DONE WITHIN

01:13:35.711 --> 01:13:38.547
THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE COME

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:39.214
BEFORE THE CITY MOST APPLICANTS

01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:39.414
ARE.

01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:43.018
ILL PREPARED TO DO THAT NOTICE

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:43.685
SEEING IN THE TIME LINE AND OF

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:47.156
WHICH THEY APPLY SO I ONLY SEE

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:47.823
ONE PROJECT ACTUALLY INTEND TO

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:51.093
USE THE PERMIT STREAMLINING ACT

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:51.760
AND IT WAS -- NOT EVEN A HOUSING

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:55.164
PROJECT IT WAS A TELECOM PROJECT --

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:55.798
AND THERE WAS A LAWSUIT BETWEEN

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:56.465
THE CITY AND IT WAS FOUND THAT

01:13:56.532 --> 01:13:59.635
THEY DIDN'T DO THE ADEQUATE

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:00.235
PUBLIC NOTICING IN ORDER FOR

01:14:00.302 --> 01:14:03.505
THEIR PROJECT TO BE DEEMED

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:03.772
APPROVED.

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:08.010
SO -- BUT LET'S TALK A LITTLE

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:08.677
BIT MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS THIS

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:09.311
IS WHY YOU'D WANT TO BE DEEMED

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:09.978
APPROVED BECAUSE YOU REALLY WANT

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:12.281
TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B..

01:14:12.347 --> 01:14:16.218
VERY QUICKLY AND AS YOU CAN SEE

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:16.919
IT THIS IS IN A LADDER WHEN WE

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:20.455
HAVE AN EXTENSIVE JUNGLE GYM OF

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:24.293
PROCESS THAT TAKES YOU THROUGH --

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:24.760
BOTH A PRE MEETING AN

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:28.497
APPLICATION A COMPLETE AS RUBIO

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:29.131
ALL THE STAFF ANALYSIS AND IF

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:29.731
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- NOT A

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:33.068
MINISTERIAL BUILDING PERMIT BUT

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:33.569
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AN

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:36.972
APPLICATION THAT WANTS TO

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:37.639
INCREASE THE DENSITY ON A SITE.

01:14:37.706 --> 01:14:41.009
WE'VE GOT SICK WELL WE'VE GOT

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:41.643
ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURES WE'VE

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:42.311
GOT LOTS OF TECHNICAL ANNOUNCES

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:45.480
THAT WE REQUIRE BEFORE THE CITY

01:14:45.547 --> 01:14:46.048
CAN CERTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:46.315
DOCUMENT.

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:49.618
AND THEN ALL THIS LEADS UP TO A

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:50.252
STAFF REPORT A HEARING AND THE

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:53.922
ABILITY TO HEAL BOTH THE PROJECT

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:54.590
TO AND DID OF OUR MENTAL PROCESS

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:57.726
SO.

01:14:57.793 --> 01:14:58.393
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD REASON FOR

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:01.930
THIS PROCESS BUT IT TAKES UP A

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:02.264
LOT OF TIME.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:02.931
SO IN TERMS OF THAT ONE OF THE

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:06.368
OBSTACLES TO MIDDLE INCOME

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:07.002
HOUSING PRODUCTION REALLY IS

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:07.669
THIS TIME TO PROCESS THE ONE OF

01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:10.505
THE SOLUTIONS IS TO MAKE MORE

01:15:10.572 --> 01:15:10.973
PROJECTS BY RIGHT AND

01:15:11.039 --> 01:15:11.306
MINISTERIAL.

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:14.743
AND IN AS MUCH AS THE STATE CAN

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:15.410
DO THAT -- FOR AS AND AS A WAY

01:15:15.477 --> 01:15:18.680
THAT YOU HAVE HELPED A

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:19.214
PREVIOUSLY WITH AFFORDABLE

01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:19.481
HOUSING.

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:22.784
DENSITY BONUS THINGS LIKE THAT --

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:23.352
IT'S BEEN VERY VERY HELPFUL

01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:27.189
CITIES IN GENERAL NEED TO

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:27.789
IDENTIFY WHERE -- RESTRICTIVE

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:31.260
ZONING EXIST AND THEY NEED -- TO

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:31.860
UP ZONE SO THAT WE CAN GET

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:32.461
BETTER DENSITY SO THAT WE CAN

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:35.664
GET MORE UNITS YOU SEEN -- HELLO

01:15:35.731 --> 01:15:36.331
OUR NUMBERS ARE AND HOW HIGH ARE

01:15:36.398 --> 01:15:39.568
TARGETS ARE.

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:39.902
AND SO THAT.

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:43.805
IN ITSELF IS A GOOD WAY TO GO

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:44.539
WITH IT THE STATE HAS DONE A LOT --

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:47.910
THE MOVE FROM LEVEL OF SERVICE

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:48.443
TO VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:49.011
ANALYSIS FOR TRANSPORTATION

01:15:49.077 --> 01:15:52.014
THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG HELP

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:52.648
BUT I'M SURE OUR OTHER PANELISTS

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:56.151
LATER WE'LL WE'LL TOUCH ON THAT --

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:56.785
BUT THE IN DEPTH -- STUDIES AND

01:15:56.852 --> 01:16:00.689
ANALYSIS REQUIRED FOR SECRET IS

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:01.323
CLOSURES AND DON'T GET ME WRONG

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:04.860
I A YOU GUYS READ MY BIO I'M A

01:16:04.927 --> 01:16:08.931
TREE HUGGER WENT TO UC SANTA

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:09.398
CRUZ I'M ALL ABOUT IT.

01:16:09.464 --> 01:16:09.932
AND BUT IT'S REALLY THE

01:16:09.998 --> 01:16:10.599
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS AND THE LEVEL

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:12.968
OF DETAIL THAT WE REQUIRE.

01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:13.635
ON A CONCEPTUAL PROJECT IN ORDER

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:14.202
TO GET -- THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:16:14.269 --> 01:16:17.205
DISCLOSURES THAT ARE REQUIRED BY

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:17.839
SECRET SEE WHAT -- SO MIDDLE

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:21.476
INCOME HOUSING HOW IS IT

01:16:21.543 --> 01:16:22.144
DIFFERENT WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:25.314
WHY WAS I TALKING ABOUT SEE

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:25.881
BECAUSE SO MUCH WALL AND I

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:26.515
DELAYED MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:29.518
AND I'VE HEARD A LOT OF

01:16:29.584 --> 01:16:30.118
DEVELOPERS LATELY TALK ABOUT

01:16:30.185 --> 01:16:30.619
MORE ATTAINABLE HOMES.

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:33.722
AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT WHAT WHAT

01:16:33.789 --> 01:16:34.423
CAN PEOPLE AFFORDABLE IF WE GIVE

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:35.057
THEM WHAT IS THAT PRODUCT LOOK

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:35.590
LIKE AND SO WE'RE SEEING

01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:38.093
DIFFERENT PRODUCT TAGS COME INTO

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:38.627

WHICH WAS.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:11.860
REALLY HARD TO GET TO IT'S AN

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:12.427
OLD STATE LAW COLLABORATIVE

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:15.564

MODERATE WHICH TO MY

01:20:02.597 --> 01:20:03.198
UNDERSTANDING IS MORE THAN THE

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:03.832
MARKET CAN BEAR -- THAT WE HAVE

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:14.743

ARE THERE STILL ARTIFICIALLY

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:41.436
HIGH AND THAT.

ONE AND THEY ONLY GETS MORE IN

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.068
PERFECT WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:20.769
RIGHT AND SO IT IS IT AS YOU SAY

01:22:20.835 --> 01:22:21.403
AS A AS A COMMITTEE TREE HUGGER

01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:24.105
WHICH I WOULD CONSIDER MYSELF TO

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:24.806
BE AS WELL -- YOU KNOW IT ISN'T

01:22:24.873 --> 01:22:25.440
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO REMOVE OR

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:28.343
ELIMINATE SOMETHING BUT IT IS TO

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:28.877
SAY THAT EVERYTHING NEEDS

01:22:28.943 --> 01:22:29.544
UPDATING I DO THAT UPDATING OF

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:32.547
CIRCUMSTANCE AND AND REALITIES

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:33.181
ON THE GROUND -- I'M NOT SURE

01:22:33.248 --> 01:22:33.782
NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AT THE

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:36.718
MIDDLE INCOME PART OF OUR

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:37.285
COMMUNITY WAS TO THE Q. LI

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:37.952
IMPACTED AS IT IS NOW AND SO --

01:22:38.019 --> 01:22:40.789
IT'S A GENERAL INVITATION FOR

01:22:40.855 --> 01:22:41.323
PEOPLE JOBS LIKE MY TO DO

01:22:41.389 --> 01:22:41.990
SOMETHING RIGHT WHICH IS -- BUT

01:22:42.057 --> 01:22:45.193
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY HOW TO

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:45.894
GET TO THE ACTION PART WHICH IS

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.528
WHERE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:49.264
YOU WERE MAKING AND I LIKE A

01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:49.831
JUNGLE GYM REFERENCE -- THAT

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:53.268
LATTER JUNGLE GYMS IT'S A FUN

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:53.935
COMMITTEE HEARING -- BUT WHAT I

01:22:54.002 --> 01:22:54.636
THINK I HEARD YOU SAYING IS THAT

01:22:54.703 --> 01:22:57.605
THERE IS A TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE

01:22:57.672 --> 01:22:58.173
OF A MORE RECENT PIECE OF

01:22:58.239 --> 01:23:01.676
LEGISLATION SB THREE SEVENTY

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:02.243
FIVE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.877
HELPFUL BUT IT'S NOT AS HELPFUL

01:23:02.944 --> 01:23:05.780
AS IT COULD BE.

01:23:05.847 --> 01:23:06.448
MAYBE THAT'S A LEGISLATIVE IDEA

01:23:06.514 --> 01:23:07.082
FOR THIS COULD BE COMMITTEE TO

01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:07.549
CONSIDER -- FOR FUTURE

01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:10.118
LEGISLATIVE SESSION.

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:10.719
YEAH I DEFINITELY THINK THAT

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:11.353
THAT WOULD KIND OF KNOWING WHAT

01:23:11.419 --> 01:23:14.422
WE KNOW NOW AND WHERE WE ARE AND

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:15.023
IN IN THE CRISIS LOOKING AT

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:18.660
THOSE CRITERIA THAT REALLY ARE

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:19.327
ABOUT THE PROJECTS THAT WE WANT

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:22.364
TO SEE A LONG HIGH PERFORMING

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.931
TRANSIT -- WHICH YOU KNOW

01:23:22.997 --> 01:23:26.534
IDEALLY IN OUR CITY IS ABOUT

01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:27.135
THAT TRANSIT THEIR RUNS EVERY

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:27.802
DIED TEN MINUTES OR OR BETTER --

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:31.306
THAT IF WE COULD REDUCE THAT

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:31.906
COMPLEXITY AND YOU KNOW I HAD

01:23:31.973 --> 01:23:35.510
THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO ACTUALLY

01:23:35.577 --> 01:23:36.111
SAID WE'RE GONNA CALL THE MID

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:39.147
COAST AND TRANSIT PRIORITY

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:39.414
PROJECT.

01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:40.081
WE WOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN ABLE

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:43.551
TO STREAMLINE SO ARE PROJECTS

01:23:43.618 --> 01:23:44.252
ALONG THE MID COAST SO -- IF WE

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:47.856
CAN REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY WE CAN

01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:48.456
BRING AYE I THINK THAT WE CAN

01:23:48.523 --> 01:24:00.135
GET THE PROJECTS THAT WE WANT IN

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:00.602
A FASTER TIME PERIOD.

01:24:00.668 --> 01:24:01.269
WE SHOULD GET TO TALK ABOUT THAT

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:04.272
OF THIS THIS COMMITTEES AS A

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:04.939
SELECT COMMITTEE WERE REALLY --

01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:05.607
COLLECTOR OF IDEAS -- THERE ARE

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:08.376
INTENDED TO BE EVENTUALLY --

01:24:08.443 --> 01:24:08.843
WANTED TO LEGISLATORS

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:09.477
LEGISLATION AND WE HAVE DONE A

01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:10.044
NUMBER OF BILLS SO NOW THE

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:12.514
HOUSING COMMISSION THE CITY SAN

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:13.181
DIEGO -- AND OTHERS TO ACTUALLY

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:13.681
CREATE LAWS OF FROM THIS

01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:14.349
COMMITTEE -- THIS -- AND SOME OF

01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:17.218
THE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE PREVIOUS

01:24:17.285 --> 01:24:17.752
SPEAKERS I THINK OF WELL

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:18.386
CREATING THAT THE LIST OF IDEAS

01:24:18.453 --> 01:24:18.987
THAT WE CAN -- WORK ON IN THE

01:24:19.053 --> 01:24:20.922
FALL AND HOPEFULLY PRODUCTION --

01:24:20.989 --> 01:24:21.589
IN THE NEW YEAR -- I WOULD WRAP

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:22.223
UP -- I KNOW THAT WE DIDN'T ASK

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:22.857
YOU TO SO BE PREPARED FOR THIS

01:24:22.924 --> 01:24:25.026
BUT AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE

01:24:25.093 --> 01:24:25.693
STATE -- THE LAND TRUST -- THE

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:26.327
MTS I KNOW THE CITY SAN DIEGO'S

01:24:26.394 --> 01:24:29.531
EMBARKING ON AN EFFORT TO LOOK

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:30.198
AT ITS PROPERTY AND TO SEE WHAT

01:24:30.265 --> 01:24:30.899
IT MAY BE ABLE TO BRING TO BEAR.

01:24:30.965 --> 01:24:33.301
MY UNDERSTANDING IS A WHAT THE

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:33.935
CITY IS CURRENTLY LOOKING AT IS

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:34.569
GENERALLY FOR THE VERY LOW AND

01:24:34.636 --> 01:24:37.839
LOW INCOME -- MARKET BECAUSE

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:38.339
EVERYBODY'S THE SURPLUS

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:38.973
PROPERTIES THAT ARE BEING THAT

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:41.776
IT CURRENTLY.

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:42.477
YEAH THAT'S RIGHT I THINK THAT --

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:43.178
OUT OF OUR TOTAL PROPERTIES MORE

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:46.181
ONE OF THE LARGEST LANDOWNING

01:24:46.247 --> 01:24:46.681
MUNICIPALITIES AND WE'VE

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:47.315
TARGETED ABOUT EIGHTY DIFFERENT

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:50.318
PROPERTIES AND AND ARE PUTTING

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:50.952
THOSE OUT AND WE'RE DEFINITELY

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:54.556
LOOKING AT THE LOW TO LOW INCOME

01:24:54.622 --> 01:24:54.823
FOR THAT.

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:58.460
IS -- CONTEMPLATION OF WORKING

01:24:58.526 --> 01:24:59.093
IN THE WORKFORCE SORT OF MIDDLE

01:24:59.160 --> 01:24:59.594
INCOME HOUSING FOR THOSE

01:24:59.661 --> 01:25:02.497
PROPERTIES.

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:03.164
THAT YEAH I I I I WOULD NEED TO

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:03.698
CHECK WITH OUR REAL ESTATE

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:04.332
ASSETS DEPARTMENT BUT I BELIEVE

01:25:04.399 --> 01:25:06.768
SO.

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:07.368
I JUST -- WOULD PUT OUT AGAIN

01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:08.069
AND GENERAL PLEA FOR WHOM I HEAR

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:11.272
MOST FROM AND I THINK YOUR CHART

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:11.940
AGAIN REALLY MAKES THE CASE FOR

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:12.574
WHY THAT SHOULD BE AT LEAST A

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.376
CONSIDERATION -- AND RECOGNIZING

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:16.044
THAT THIS IS NO SMALL TASK IN MY

01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:16.611
OWN NEIGHBORHOOD THERE'S A

01:25:16.678 --> 01:25:19.647
THERE'S A SUGGESTION OF COURSE I

01:25:19.714 --> 01:25:20.315
AND I THINK THAT'S HEALTHY YEAH

01:25:20.381 --> 01:25:23.418
IT'S A GOOD CONVERSATION -- BUT

01:25:23.485 --> 01:25:23.885
MUCH LIKE THE STATE'S

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:24.552
CONVERSATION OF IDEAS SITES THAT

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:27.822
ARE IDENTIFIED THEY DON'T ALWAYS

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:28.490
PAN OUT -- ALSO IF THOSE DON'T

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:32.060
PAN OUT AS IDEAS FOR DEVELOPMENT

01:25:32.126 --> 01:25:35.897
PERHAPS THERE IS -- SOME OTHER --

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:36.498
FOR FOR VERY LOWER LOW INCOME

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:37.065
PRESS OR OTHER USES THAT IN

01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:40.301
THERE -- AND I YOU KNOW GET

01:25:40.368 --> 01:25:40.768
WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN

01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:41.369
COORDINATE COLLECTIVELY -- I

01:25:41.436 --> 01:25:41.903
RECOGNIZE THAT THE STATE

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:44.405
PROPERTIES A GREAT EXAMPLE --

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:45.106
THE STATE BUILDING DOWNTOWN IS A

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:48.543
GREAT EXAMPLE OF ALL OF A LARGE

01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:49.177
PROPERTY NEXT TO A WHOLE LOT OF

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:49.544
CITY PROPERTY.

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:57.085
MAYBE THERE'S SOME CROSS

01:25:57.151 --> 01:26:01.256
COLLABORATION THAT'S KIND OF THE

01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:01.789
LEGISLATION EITHER USED AS

01:26:01.856 --> 01:26:02.390
INTENDED TO REALLY FORCE THAT

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:05.460
CONVERSATION OF WHAT YOU CAN DO

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:06.094
COLLABORATIVELY FOR MORE PUBLIC

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:06.361

CONTINUE.

01:26:11.065 --> 01:26:11.633
TO DIG DEEP AND IDENTIFY THEM

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:13.568
AND BUILD SUPPORT AROUND THEM SO

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:14.202

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:41.456
CLIMATE -- AND I THINK I SAID IT

01:27:41.522 --> 01:27:42.023
BEFORE BUT TO GET THEIRS BOB

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:45.560
HOUSING IS THE MOST IS THE NORM

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:46.194
IS THE LARGEST ISSUE FACING --

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:46.761
THE STATE GENERALLY TODAY I

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:49.764
THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT

01:27:49.831 --> 01:27:50.431
CLIMATE IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:53.835
FOR ALL HUMANITY -- AND THIS IS

01:27:53.901 --> 01:27:54.502
QUITE ESSENTIAL BIG GLOBALLY ACT

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:57.772
LOCALLY SO WHAT CAN WE DO AT THE

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:58.406
STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL -- TO TO

01:27:58.473 --> 01:28:02.176
BE POSITIVELY IMPACT THIS ISSUE

I'M FLOOR JEWELERS.

01:28:14.989 --> 01:28:15.156
GREAT.

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:15.790
I MEAN I JUST HAVE TO START BY

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:16.391
SAYING WE CANNOT FORGET THAT

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:18.593
ACTUALLY WAS DURING YOUR TENURE

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:18.860
AS MAYOR.

01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:19.427
THAT WE CREATED THE IDEA OF

01:28:19.494 --> 01:28:19.994
HAVING THAT SUSTAINABILITY

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:20.561
DEPARTMENT AND DIRECTOR AND

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:22.930
SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO LEAD THE

01:28:22.997 --> 01:28:23.564
CHARGE FOR CLIMATE ACTION AND A

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:26.768
LOT.

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:27.335
DREAM IT COMES TO LAST -- SO

01:28:27.402 --> 01:28:30.938
THANK YOU PHONE NUMBER GLORIA

01:28:31.005 --> 01:28:31.606
FOR ALLOWING US TO TESTIFY HERE

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:32.140
TODAY AND ADDRESSING THE

01:28:32.206 --> 01:28:35.209
CONNECTION BETWEEN CLIMATE AND

01:28:35.276 --> 01:28:35.476
HOUSING.

01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:36.077
AT OUR MISSION IT COME ACTION

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:39.380
CAMPAIGN SIMPLE.

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:40.048
STOP THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND MAKE

01:28:40.114 --> 01:28:40.615
CLIMATE A TOP PRIORITY FOR

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:43.685
POLICY MAKERS EVERYWHERE UNTIL I

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:44.185
MISSION IS ACHIEVED.

01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:44.852
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY NO ONE

01:28:44.919 --> 01:28:47.789
CAN TOUCH OUR TREE HUGGER

01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:52.093
CREDENTIALS IN THIS ROUND.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:52.660
I KNEW I WAS THINKING CYCLE

01:28:52.727 --> 01:28:52.994
FARTHER NOT.

01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:53.628
AS THIS MEANS TACKLING HOUSING

01:28:53.695 --> 01:28:56.731
POLICY BECAUSE HOUSING POLICY IS

01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:57.398
CLIMATE POLICY HOW WE BUILD AND

01:28:57.465 --> 01:29:00.368
RETROFIT OUR COMMUNITIES IS KEY

01:29:00.435 --> 01:29:00.868
TO SUSTAINABLE FUTURE.

01:29:00.935 --> 01:29:01.502
ALSO KEY IS HOW WE ENSURE THAT

01:29:01.569 --> 01:29:04.605
THE HOUSING WE BUILD IS

01:29:04.672 --> 01:29:05.206
AFFORDABLE TO MIDDLE AND LOWER

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:05.606
INCOME FAMILIES.

01:29:05.673 --> 01:29:09.043
AS SENDING HAS REPORTED AND THE

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.711
STATISTIC MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN

01:29:09.777 --> 01:29:12.747
CITED OF THE NEW HOUSING BILLS

01:29:12.814 --> 01:29:13.381
SINCE TWENTY TEN ABOUT 76% IS

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:13.948
CONSIDERED OUT OF REACH FOR

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:17.285
FAMILIES MAKING LESS THAN NINETY

01:29:17.351 --> 01:29:17.885
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:21.155
WE BELIEVE ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS

01:29:21.222 --> 01:29:21.689
AND IT REINFORCES WHAT IS

01:29:21.756 --> 01:29:22.223
ALREADY BEEN SAID TODAY.

01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:25.359
THE TACKLES BUT THE CLIMATE AND

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:25.993
HOUSING CRISIS FOR THE MIDDLE

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:26.627
AND WORKING CLASS AND HOPEFULLY

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:29.630
LOWER INCOME FAMILIES TO IS TO

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:30.298
CREATE POLICIES THAT RESULT IN

01:29:30.364 --> 01:29:30.932
MORE BALANCED AND VERY HOUSING

01:29:30.998 --> 01:29:33.935
SUPPLY IN URBAN AREAS.

01:29:34.001 --> 01:29:34.402
ESPECIALLY THOSE AREAS

01:29:34.469 --> 01:29:35.036
TRADITIONALLY CENTERED AROUND

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:37.905
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES.

01:29:37.972 --> 01:29:38.439
IF WE FOCUS ON BUILDING A

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:39.073
VARIETY OF HONG CHOICES LIKE

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:42.410
DUPLEXES TRI PLEX IS IMPORT

01:29:42.477 --> 01:29:42.977
TAXES AND RESIDENTIAL CITY

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:43.344
NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:46.481
THESE KINDS OF MID CITY HOMES

01:29:46.547 --> 01:29:47.181
COULD HELP KERR PRICES IN GIVE

01:29:47.248 --> 01:29:50.384
MODERATE INCOME WORKING FAMILIES

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:50.918
AND SMALL HOUSEHOLDS LIKE

01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:51.552
SENIORS AND YOUNG COUPLES MORE

01:29:51.619 --> 01:29:54.489
AFFORDABLE OPTIONS.

01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:55.156
THIS WILL ALSO HELP ADDRESS THE

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:58.593
CLIMATE CRISIS IN TWO WAYS.

01:29:58.659 --> 01:29:59.193
NUMBER ONE SMALLER HOMES MEANS

01:29:59.260 --> 01:29:59.694
LESS CARBON POLLUTION.

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:02.997
SIDELINE AND THINK BLANK I THINK

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:03.631
TANK IN SEATTLE TO STUDY THAT

01:30:03.698 --> 01:30:04.298
DEMONSTRATES A FEW BILL TO BLOCK

01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:07.568
THEY TO STUDY BUT HIS BILL TO

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:08.202
BLOCK OF JUST SINGLE FAMILY

01:30:08.269 --> 01:30:08.836
HOMES AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:11.372
THE STREET A BILL TO BLOCK.

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:12.039
WITH DIFFERENT HOUSING TYPE SUCH

01:30:12.106 --> 01:30:12.673
AS A DUPLEX AND TRIPLEX AND FOR

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:15.676
BY FROM THE OTHER SIDE IT IS

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:19.514
POSSIBLE TO CUT ENERGY USE 20%.

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:20.014
AN RTC ANOTHER NATIONAL

01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:20.681
ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANISM GOING TO

01:30:20.748 --> 01:30:21.315
GET ORGANIZATION SAYS THAT NO

01:30:21.382 --> 01:30:23.985
OTHER SECTOR OFFERS A HIGHER

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:24.685
POTENTIAL. FOR SINGLE SOURCE OF

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:27.889
ENERGY REDUCTION THAN

01:30:27.955 --> 01:30:28.556
RESIDENTIAL EFFICIENCY WHICH HAS

01:30:28.623 --> 01:30:29.257
A LOT TO DO WITH THE SIZE OF THE

01:30:29.323 --> 01:30:32.426
HOME GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

01:30:32.493 --> 01:30:32.827
HAVE BEEN HOMES.

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:33.461
THEY DON'T USE ALL THE ROOMS IN

01:30:33.528 --> 01:30:36.564
THE HOUSE AND THEY HAVE BUT THEY

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:37.231
STILL HAVE TO HEAT AND COOL THE

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:37.799
ROOMS AND UNFORTUNATELY THE

01:30:37.865 --> 01:30:40.535
ENERGIES GOES UP.

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:41.202
NUMBER TWO INTEL CAN ALSO REDUCE

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:44.605
DRIVING.

01:30:44.672 --> 01:30:45.139
AND SAVE EVERYONE MONEY.

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:45.773
THE KIND OF BENEFITS GROW MAY

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:46.240
INCLUDE THE POTENTIAL

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:48.943
TRANSPORTATION SAVINGS OF

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:49.610
LETTING PEOPLE LIVE CLOSER TO

01:30:49.677 --> 01:30:52.914
EACH OTHER TO JOBS AND THE SHOPS.

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:53.447
ARE LIVING WITHIN WALKING

01:30:53.514 --> 01:30:54.115
DISTANCE OF HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:54.549
TO GET THEM TO THEIR

01:30:54.615 --> 01:30:57.118
DESTINATIONS.

01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:57.819
ANOTHER SITE SILENCE ON MY GO TO

01:30:57.885 --> 01:31:01.689
THINK TANKS ANOTHER SITE WHEN

01:31:01.756 --> 01:31:02.290
FIGURE SAYS THAT BOOSTING THE

01:31:02.356 --> 01:31:02.890
NUMBER OF HOMES ON RESIDENTIAL

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:05.793
BLOCKS BY ONE THIRD.

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:06.460
CORRELATES WITH A DROP OF ABOUT

01:31:06.527 --> 01:31:09.764
A THOUSAND MILES DRIVEN PER YEAR

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:10.131
PER HOUSEHOLD.

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:14.035
A 5% DROP EVEN AFTER CORRECTING

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:14.669
FOR HOUSEHOLD SIZE AND INCOME.

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:17.872
SO WHAT WE KNOW IS A DENSE

01:31:17.939 --> 01:31:18.472
WALKABLE NEIGHBORHOODS PEOPLE

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:19.040
CENTERED PLANNING AND MULTI

01:31:19.106 --> 01:31:22.310
MODAL TRANSIT NETWORKS MEAN THAT

01:31:22.376 --> 01:31:22.977
WE CAN SPEND LESS TIME COMMUTING

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:23.311
IN OUR CARS.

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:26.414
AND CONTRIBUTING TO DIRTY AIR

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:26.881
AND CARBON POLLUTION.

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:27.515
ALSO HELPING TO IMPROVE PUBLIC

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:30.785
HEALTH AND CREATING CONNECTED

01:31:30.852 --> 01:31:31.118
COMMUNITIES.

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:34.622
WE ALSO HAVE.

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:35.289
TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT ALSO MEANS WE

01:31:35.356 --> 01:31:38.693
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS

01:31:38.759 --> 01:31:39.393
THE INEQUITIES OF THE PAST WITH.

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:39.994
THE INEQUITIES OF PAST ZONING

MORE AFFORDABLE WE SUPPORT

TYPES SIZES AND COST.

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:08.322
IN FACT WE KNOW WE CANNOT MEET

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:08.990
OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND UNLESS AND

01:32:09.056 --> 01:32:09.690
UNTIL WE EMPLOYMENT OR CREATIVE

01:32:09.757 --> 01:32:12.627
AND INNOVATIVE HOUSING SUPPLY

01:32:12.693 --> 01:32:12.894
OPTIONS.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:13.461
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA KNOWS

01:32:13.527 --> 01:32:16.330
MORE THAN ANYBODY.

01:32:16.397 --> 01:32:16.931
THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO HAS AN

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:17.465
AMBITIOUS CLIMATE PLAN.

01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:20.568
LEGALLY BINDING.

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:21.235
BUT ALMOST MATCHES THE AMBITION

01:32:21.302 --> 01:32:24.672
OF THE STATE'S COMMON PLAN THE

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:25.273
CITY MUST REDUCE OUR CARBON

01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:28.943
FOOTPRINT HALF BY TWENTY THIRTY

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:29.610
FIVE THE STATE KIND OF PLAN GOES

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:30.278
OUT FARTHER IN TIME AND THEY AIM

01:32:30.344 --> 01:32:32.980
TO REDUCE TO DE CARBONIZED 80%

01:32:33.047 --> 01:32:33.147
BY.

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:33.814
TWENTY FIFTY AND ONE OF THE LAST

01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:37.218
ACTS OF GOVERNOR BROWN WAS TO

01:32:37.285 --> 01:32:37.785
PASS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO

01:32:37.852 --> 01:32:38.419
ACTUALLY HIT CARMEN NEUTRALITY

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:41.789
BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE WHICH IS AN

01:32:41.856 --> 01:32:42.323
EXTRAORDINARY TASK BUT A

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:45.760
NECESSARY. ONE FOR US LOCALLY

01:32:45.826 --> 01:32:46.360
AND STATEWIDE TRANSPORTATION

01:32:46.427 --> 01:32:46.928
REMAINS THE LARGEST DRIVER

01:32:46.994 --> 01:32:49.764
CARBON EMISSIONS AND THOSE

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:50.364
EMISSIONS ARE ONLY GOING TO GO

01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:50.531
UP.

01:32:50.598 --> 01:32:51.065
IT REMAINS OUR MOST VEXING

01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:54.268
CHALLENGE. TO TURN THIS TREND

01:32:54.335 --> 01:32:54.869
AROUND WE NEED A SIGNIFICANT

01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:58.039
SHIFT IN HOW COMMUTERS GET TO

01:32:58.105 --> 01:32:58.239
WORK.

01:32:58.306 --> 01:32:58.906
AND A REDUCTION IN VEHICLE MILES

01:32:58.973 --> 01:32:59.540
TRAVELED FOR THOSE THAT CONTINUE

01:32:59.607 --> 01:33:02.276
TO DRIVE.

01:33:02.343 --> 01:33:02.843
THIS WILL ONLY HAPPEN IF WE

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:03.444
BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:33:03.511 --> 01:33:06.747
SUPPLY YOUR TRANSIT AND JOBS.

01:33:06.814 --> 01:33:07.381
ONE OF THE MAIN STRATEGIES THE

01:33:07.448 --> 01:33:10.518
CITY HAS CITED TO REACH THOSE

01:33:10.584 --> 01:33:11.052
GOALS HAS BEEN UPDATING

01:33:11.118 --> 01:33:11.719
COMMUNITY PLANS AS WAS MENTIONED

01:33:11.786 --> 01:33:11.986
EARLIER.

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:15.156
MOSTLY FOCUSED ON OPPORTUNITIES

01:33:15.222 --> 01:33:15.790
TO UP SOME TO ALLOW MORE AND

01:33:15.856 --> 01:33:18.993
FILL I'M HERE WITH HIGH QUALITY

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:19.694
TRANSIT AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION.

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:23.297
THE CHALLENGES THAT THE CITY IS

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:23.965
BASED HAS FACED AND STILL FACING

01:33:24.031 --> 01:33:24.532
SIGNIFICANT PUSHBACK FROM

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:27.668
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ABOUT UPS

01:33:27.735 --> 01:33:27.902
OWNING.

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:31.405
EVEN BIKE LANES AND THE CITY HAS

01:33:31.472 --> 01:33:32.039
OFTEN AND I'M YOU KNOW SOMEONE

01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:32.640
UNDERSTANDABLY GIVEN POLITICAL

01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:35.910
REALITIES CAPITULATED TO THESE

01:33:35.977 --> 01:33:36.344
COMMUNITY DEMANDS.

01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:36.844
AS A RESULT HOWEVER OUR

01:33:36.911 --> 01:33:39.747
COMMUNITY PLANS.

01:33:39.814 --> 01:33:40.348
ART UPDATE CAN YOU PLANS ARE

01:33:40.414 --> 01:33:44.018
STILL NOT ZONE SUFFICIENTLY TO

01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:44.618
MEET OUR CAPITALS AND THAT'S

01:33:44.685 --> 01:33:48.022
JUST BASED ON DATA AND ANALYSIS

01:33:48.089 --> 01:33:48.522
THAT THE CITY PRODUCES.

01:33:48.589 --> 01:33:52.259
ON A POSITIVE NOTE HAS.

01:33:52.326 --> 01:33:52.893
AT LEAST HAS MENTIONED THE CITY

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:53.494
OF PASSAGE WHAT POLICIES LIKE

01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:56.697
THE DENSITY BONUS AND REDUCE NEW

01:33:56.764 --> 01:33:56.964
PARKING.

01:33:57.031 --> 01:33:57.531
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS WERE

01:33:57.598 --> 01:34:00.868
FINALLY DISCUSSING AT SOME REAL

01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:04.772
TRANSIT SOLUTIONS REGIONALLY.

01:34:04.839 --> 01:34:05.406
BUT TAKEN TOGETHER WE ARE STILL

01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:05.973
NOT ON TRACK. TO REACH OUR

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:09.343
OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:09.977
FOR TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND WE'RE

01:34:10.044 --> 01:34:10.544
WE'RE JUST NOT MOVING FAST

01:34:10.611 --> 01:34:13.080
ENOUGH AND ALL OF THESE ISSUES.

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:17.251
THE OTHER CHALLENGE IS THAT ARE

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:17.485
COUNTY.

01:34:17.551 --> 01:34:18.152
CONTINUES TO PRODUCE PROP WRITE

01:34:18.219 --> 01:34:21.622
CHECKS ENCOURAGES DEVELOPERS TO

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:25.559
CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON BUILDING

01:34:25.626 --> 01:34:25.726
OUT.

01:34:25.793 --> 01:34:25.960
NOT UP.

01:34:26.027 --> 01:34:26.560
THIS MAKES IT EVEN HARDER TO

01:34:26.627 --> 01:34:27.161
PERSUADE DEVELOPERS TO FIGURE

01:34:27.228 --> 01:34:30.131
OUT HOW TO BUILD AND FILL IN

01:34:30.197 --> 01:34:30.731
CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE WAYS

01:34:30.798 --> 01:34:34.168
THAT MEET HOUSING NEEDS FOR ALL

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:34.535
INCOME LEVELS.

01:34:34.602 --> 01:34:35.202
AND IT THREATENS OUR ABILITY TO

01:34:35.269 --> 01:34:35.836
MEET OUR CARBON REDUCTION GOALS

01:34:35.903 --> 01:34:38.639
AND THREATENS AIR QUALITY.

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:39.206
AT THREATENS PUBLIC HEALTH.

01:34:39.273 --> 01:34:42.543
WORSE IT MUST BE NOTED THESE

01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:43.177
PROJECTS ARE NOT FOR THE MIDDLE

01:34:43.244 --> 01:34:46.480
OF WORKING CLASS.

01:34:46.547 --> 01:34:47.114
HELLO AND COST OF THESE HOMES

01:34:47.181 --> 01:34:47.782
THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:34:47.848 --> 01:34:50.851
THAT IS WHY WE ARE OPEN AND

01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:51.519
INTERESTED IN STATEWIDE POLICIES

01:34:51.585 --> 01:34:52.219
THAT WILL ENSURE WE ARE CREATING

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:54.955
SUFFICIENT UP ZONING

01:34:55.022 --> 01:34:55.523
OPPORTUNITIES FOR MULTIPLE

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:55.890
HOUSING TYPES.

01:34:55.956 --> 01:34:58.993

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:07.334
POLICY.

01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:08.002
WE MUST WORK HAND IN HAND WITH

01:35:08.069 --> 01:35:11.338
SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS

01:35:11.405 --> 01:35:11.939
FIGHTING TO KEEP FAMILIES AND

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:12.573
HOMES PREVENT DISPLACEMENT AND

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.576
MINIMIZE GENTRIFICATION.

01:35:15.643 --> 01:35:16.243
WE MUST FOCUS NOT JUST ON MIDDLE

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:19.847
INCOME HOUSING BUT ALSO ON VERY

01:35:19.914 --> 01:35:20.481
LOW INCOME HOUSING PRODUCTION

ARE IN THE MIDST OF DOING AN

01:36:43.764 --> 01:36:43.931
UPDATE.

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:44.598
ON BASS AND ALL THE CHANGES THAT

WE'VE SEEN AT THE STATE LEVEL --

ACTUAL PLAN ANNUALLY YOU SEE

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:57.278

01:36:57.344 --> 01:37:00.247
REPORT HERE -- AND I GET ASKED A

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:00.848

AFRAID TO PUT OUT DATA THAT

01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:08.722
SHOWS WHERE YOUR DEFICIENT AND

01:37:08.789 --> 01:37:09.390
THAT'S I FEEL LIKE A BIG PART OF

01:37:09.456 --> 01:37:12.493
MY JOB IS TO BE VERY HONEST AND

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.127
AN OPEN WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT.

01:37:13.194 --> 01:37:13.761
WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHERE WE'RE

01:37:13.827 --> 01:37:16.764
MAKING GOOD PROGRESS AND WHERE

01:37:16.830 --> 01:37:17.431
WE ARE DEFICIENT AND THAT'S WHAT

01:37:17.498 --> 01:37:20.601
THIS REPORT DOESN WE TEND TO DO

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:21.202
IT IN A VERY PUBLIC FRIENDLY

01:37:21.268 --> 01:37:29.076
WAYS THAT?

01:37:29.143 --> 01:37:29.677
FOLKS ACTUALLY WILL READ IT.

01:37:29.743 --> 01:37:33.180
AND SO DO. TO REITERATE THE

01:37:33.247 --> 01:37:33.847
POINT YOU'RE HEARING TODAY THIS

01:37:33.914 --> 01:37:34.415
THIS IS THE SOURCES OF OUR

01:37:34.481 --> 01:37:37.518
MISSIONS FOR THE CITY OF SAN

01:37:37.585 --> 01:37:37.751
DIEGO.

01:37:37.818 --> 01:37:38.352
YOU SEE THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:38.953
THE FIRST PART THE SECOND OF

01:37:39.019 --> 01:37:39.520
FIVE YEARS AND THAT'S ANNUAL

01:37:39.587 --> 01:37:41.522
AFTER THAT.

01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:42.156
SO WE'VE SEEN SOME PROGRESS --

01:37:42.223 --> 01:37:42.823
BUT IT'S SAD BECOMING A LITTLE

01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:45.859
BIT MORE MARGINAL AS WE'VE

01:37:45.926 --> 01:37:46.460
CAPTURED FROM THE LOW HANGING

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:47.127
FRUIT ONE POOR THING TO LOOK AT

01:37:47.194 --> 01:37:47.461
HERE IS THAT.

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:50.030
THE DARK BLUE BAR ON THE BOTTOM

01:37:50.097 --> 01:37:50.564
NOT AS OUR TRANSPORTATION

01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:51.131
EMISSIONS THOSE FOLKS HAVE

01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:51.765
MENTIONED THIS IS A BIG SOURCE

01:37:51.832 --> 01:37:54.602
OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. FOR

01:37:54.668 --> 01:37:55.202
THE CITY AND FOR PRETTY MUCH

01:37:55.269 --> 01:37:55.803
THIS LOOKS SIMILAR ACROSS THE

01:37:55.869 --> 01:37:56.470
STATE AND FOR THE STATE ITSELF.

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:58.405
THE TRANSPORTATION AND PEOPLE

01:37:58.472 --> 01:37:59.039
GETTING TO AND FROM HOME AND

01:37:59.106 --> 01:37:59.640
WORK IS THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF

01:37:59.707 --> 01:38:02.343
EMISSIONS.

01:38:02.409 --> 01:38:02.876
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.

01:38:02.943 --> 01:38:03.477
I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW HOW IT

01:38:03.544 --> 01:38:06.847
HIGHLIGHTS ARE AND REPORT AS

01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:07.514
WELL WHAT I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON

01:38:07.581 --> 01:38:08.215
TRANSPORTATION TODAY BUT WE DO --

01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:11.051
PUBLISH ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:38:11.118 --> 01:38:14.855
MEASURES THAT WE HAVE HERE.

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:15.456
I THINK IT'S EITHER JUST ONE

01:38:15.522 --> 01:38:15.956
POINTING TO SHOW HERE.

01:38:16.023 --> 01:38:19.526
ARE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE

01:38:19.593 --> 01:38:20.127
MAKING GOOD PROGRESS WE'RE ON

01:38:20.194 --> 01:38:20.761
TRACK TO REACH OUR GOALS WERE

01:38:20.828 --> 01:38:21.328
ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF

01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:21.595
SCHEDULE.

01:38:21.662 --> 01:38:23.364
BUT BY NO MEANS ARE WE CAN WE

01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.998
REST ON OUR LAURELS OR ARE SET

01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:27.868
BACK BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:38:27.935 --> 01:38:28.435
WORK TO DO AND JUST BECAUSE

01:38:28.502 --> 01:38:31.605
RATING ARE GREENHOUSE GAS CALLS

01:38:31.672 --> 01:38:32.239
IT DOESN'T MEAN READING ALL THE

01:38:32.306 --> 01:38:32.906
OTHER GOALS THAT WE WE NEED TO

01:38:32.973 --> 01:38:33.107
SEE.

01:38:33.173 --> 01:38:35.776
HOW WE HAVE DEFINITELY CAPTURED

01:38:35.843 --> 01:38:36.377
SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT MOVING

01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:40.247
FORWARD -- WE TRACK ARE CLIMB

01:38:40.314 --> 01:38:40.881
ACTUAL PLAN HERE AS YOU COULD

01:38:40.948 --> 01:38:44.518
SEE BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALLY

01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:45.052
CARE ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:45.653
EMISSIONS UNFORTUNATELY FOLKS

01:38:45.719 --> 01:38:46.253
ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT THAT

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.756
DAILY -- THAT'S NOT SOMETHING

01:38:48.822 --> 01:38:49.356
THEY CAN MEASURE OR FEEL OR

01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:52.660
UNDERSTAND BUT WHAT WE DO TRACK

01:38:52.726 --> 01:38:53.327
AND WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE

01:38:53.394 --> 01:38:53.994
OF ALL THE BENEFITS THAT YOU SEE

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:56.930
HERE SO -- WERE IMPROVING

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:57.564
QUALITY OF LIFE CLIMATE ACTION

01:38:57.631 --> 01:39:00.901
WE'RE LOOKING AT IMPROVING

01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:01.468
HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION

AND WERE PROVIDING CLEANER AND

01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:06.273
HOPEFULLY CHEAPER ENERGY TO OUR

01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:09.376
CITIZENS WERE PLANTING MORE

01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:09.610
TREES.

01:39:09.677 --> 01:39:10.311
I'M WERE INCREASING COST SAVINGS

01:39:10.377 --> 01:39:13.580

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:38.839
OF THE EFFORTS THAT WERE TALKED

01:39:38.906 --> 01:39:39.406
ABOUT TODAY AND AND I WON'T

01:39:39.473 --> 01:39:40.007
DWELL ON THIS FLIGHT BECAUSE

THEY KNOW WE'RE NEAR THE END.

01:39:42.876 --> 01:39:43.410

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:44.044
TRANSPARENT ABOUT WERE OBVIOUS

01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:47.014

01:39:47.081 --> 01:39:47.648
LATEST REPORTS AND WHERE WE NEED

01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:50.751

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:51.418
NUMBERS ARE NOT WHERE THEY NEED

01:39:51.485 --> 01:39:52.119
TO BE AT AND THAT TAKES A LOT OF

01:39:52.186 --> 01:39:52.686
HEAVY LIFTING IT TAKES THE

01:39:52.753 --> 01:39:55.022
PARTNERS IN.

01:39:55.089 --> 01:39:55.556

BECAUSE THE STUFF IS REALLY THAT

01:40:04.098 --> 01:40:07.801
EASY TO MEASURE -- THE OTHER

01:40:07.868 --> 01:40:08.435
IMPORTANT THING THAT WE TRY TO

01:40:08.502 --> 01:40:09.002
DEMONSTRATE AS WELL OF THAT

01:40:09.069 --> 01:40:11.805
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF GOING

JOB GROWTH IS 13% -- WHICH IS

01:40:25.185 --> 01:40:28.722
FAR FASTER THAN THE OVERALL JOB

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:29.390
GROWTH IN OUR ECONOMY LOCALLY IS

01:40:29.456 --> 01:40:32.493

01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:47.014
EXPRESSED ABOUT IT IS WELL YOU

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:47.648
KNOW IT IS ABOUT -- MORE HOMES

01:44:47.714 --> 01:44:48.248
COUPLE WITH TENET PROTECTIONS

01:44:48.315 --> 01:44:51.184
COUPLED WITH FUNDING TO ACTUALLY

01:44:51.251 --> 01:44:51.752
EFFECTUATE THIS TIME WHETHER

01:44:51.818 --> 01:44:52.252
IT'S THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:44:52.319 --> 01:44:52.786
ENHANCEMENTS THE COMMUNITY

01:44:52.853 --> 01:44:55.656
AMENITIES ALL THESE THINGS

01:44:55.722 --> 01:44:56.289
TOGETHER I THINK IS HOW CAN WE

01:44:56.356 --> 01:44:59.559
ESTABLISHED OF THE LATTER IN A

01:44:59.626 --> 01:45:00.127
FUNCTIONAL HOUSING ECONOMY.

01:45:00.193 --> 01:45:00.661
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ONE

01:45:00.727 --> 01:45:03.664
CURRENTLY RIGHT -- IN SO IT'S

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:04.264
IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT IT'S

01:45:04.331 --> 01:45:04.931
PRODUCTION IT REALLY ALL LEVELS

01:45:04.998 --> 01:45:07.901
INCLUDING THE UPPER AND BECAUSE

01:45:07.968 --> 01:45:08.535
WHICH FOLKS IN PLACE THE TWO BUT

01:45:08.602 --> 01:45:12.105
IT'S RECOGNIZING THE INEQUITY.

01:45:12.172 --> 01:45:12.773
IN EQUITY OF OUR CURRENT SYSTEM

01:45:12.839 --> 01:45:13.373
WHICH IS THERE'S NO PRODUCTION

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:13.907
THE MIDDLE AND THERE'S NOT

01:45:13.974 --> 01:45:16.376
ENOUGH AT THE VERY LOW IN AND SO

01:45:16.443 --> 01:45:17.044
FOR GOING TO HANDLE THIS PROBLEM

01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:17.678
EQUITABLY REQUIRES EVERYTHING.

01:45:17.744 --> 01:45:20.614
THAT YOU SAY TED DISPLACEMENT ON

01:45:20.681 --> 01:45:21.314
STUFF ARE REAL ISSUES -- IN THAT

01:45:21.381 --> 01:45:24.618
EVERYONE HAS TO BENEFIT -- IF

01:45:24.685 --> 01:45:25.185
WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE NEW

01:45:25.252 --> 01:45:25.585
INCENTIVES A NEW.

01:45:25.652 --> 01:45:28.889
NEW I'M CONVINCED MY QUESTION I

01:45:28.955 --> 01:45:29.523
GUESS FOR BOTH OF YOU AS WE WRAP

01:45:29.589 --> 01:45:30.123
UP FROM PEOPLE AND THE WAY YOU

01:45:30.190 --> 01:45:33.293
SAID WHAT COULD THE LEGISLATURE

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:33.927
DUE TO HELP POSITIVELY IMPACT

01:45:33.994 --> 01:45:34.394
HOUSING PRODUCTION.

01:45:34.461 --> 01:45:37.497
OF WHY DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND HOW

01:45:37.564 --> 01:45:38.165
IT DIRECTLY IMPACTS KLEIN IT --

01:45:38.231 --> 01:45:41.268
EIGHTY HEARD AT LEAST TALK ABOUT

01:45:41.334 --> 01:45:41.902
YOUR POTENTIAL -- AND THEN THE

01:45:41.968 --> 01:45:45.806
TO SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE A DAY

01:45:45.872 --> 01:45:46.406
IN THE PERMITS FREE MONEY ACT

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:47.040
YOU HEARD -- THE FACT THAT WE

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:49.843
NEED TO LOOK AT EXPANDING THE

01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:50.510
AVAILABILITY OF THE LAND TRUSTS

01:45:50.577 --> 01:45:53.747
TO PARTICIPATE IN CERTAIN --

01:45:53.814 --> 01:45:54.414
SUBSIDIES WHAT WOULD YOU SEE AS

01:45:54.481 --> 01:45:55.082
BEING THINGS THAT MIGHT COME TO

01:45:55.148 --> 01:45:58.118
MIND WE SHOULD SPEND THE NEXT

01:45:58.185 --> 01:45:58.719
NUMBER OF MONTHS DEVELOPING A

01:45:58.785 --> 01:46:10.363
POTENTIALLY INTRODUCED THIS

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.664
LEGISLATION.

01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:14.768
IN.

01:46:14.835 --> 01:46:15.368
TWENTY TWENTY CONTROVERSIAL.

01:46:15.435 --> 01:46:18.805
YEAH -- KNOWING HE WILL BE.

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:19.439
YOU KNOW WHAT COULD BE WORSE FOR

01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:20.040
THE MAYOR'S I'M NOT SURE WHAT

01:46:20.107 --> 01:46:23.009
SHE'S ALLOWED TO SAY BUT I

01:46:23.076 --> 01:46:23.610
PERSONALLY THINK -- YOU KNOW

01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:24.211
VERY CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT BUT

01:46:24.277 --> 01:46:27.180
SB FIFTY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:27.814
MORE SERIOUSLY AND OVER YOU KNOW

01:46:27.881 --> 01:46:28.381
CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE TOUGH

01:46:28.448 --> 01:46:29.015
CONVERSATIONS BUT LIKE I POINTED

01:46:29.082 --> 01:46:31.451
OUT UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR

01:46:31.518 --> 01:46:32.052
COMMUNITY PLAN UPDATES THEY'RE

01:46:32.119 --> 01:46:32.753
NOT A ZONING SUFFICIENTLY FOR US

01:46:32.819 --> 01:46:33.353
TO MEET THE KIND OF PLAN GOALS

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:33.787
AND ARE CLEMENTINE.

01:46:33.854 --> 01:46:35.856
ONLY GOES TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE

01:46:35.922 --> 01:46:36.456
AND WE KNOW WE HAVE TO GET A

01:46:36.523 --> 01:46:37.124
CARBON NEUTRALITY SO WE YOU KNOW

01:46:37.190 --> 01:46:37.691
THAT'S JUST SCRATCHING THE

01:46:37.758 --> 01:46:39.893
SURFACE WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:40.494
OUR CURRENT COMMUNITY PLANS.

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:41.094
SO IT'S NOT EVEN ENOUGH NOW

01:46:41.161 --> 01:46:44.030
LOOKING AT THE CHEMICALS AND WE

01:46:44.097 --> 01:46:44.731
HAVE TO DO MORE SO I I DO FEEL.

01:46:44.798 --> 01:46:48.068
I'M STILL BIG BELIEVER AND LOCAL

01:46:48.135 --> 01:46:48.702
PROCESS AND ENGAGEMENT AS YOU

01:46:48.769 --> 01:46:49.269
KNOW I'M I GO TO THE SCREEN

01:46:49.336 --> 01:46:52.272
PLANNING MEETINGS I ENGAGE I

01:46:52.339 --> 01:46:52.606
BELIEVE IN.

01:46:52.672 --> 01:46:53.240
LOCAL CONTROL AND ALL THAT BUT

01:46:53.306 --> 01:46:56.676
THE SAME TIME IF THERE'S A GAP I

01:46:56.743 --> 01:47:00.480
THINK SOME STATE -- POLICIES AND

01:47:00.547 --> 01:47:01.148
REGULATIONS -- MIGHT BE NEEDED

01:47:01.214 --> 01:47:01.782
AND ANYTHING AND I DON'T KNOW

01:47:01.848 --> 01:47:04.684
WHAT A BILL AROUND THIS COULD

01:47:04.751 --> 01:47:08.922
LOOK LIKE.

01:47:08.989 --> 01:47:09.523
BUT ANYTHING TO STOP SPRAWL.

01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:10.157
IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO I

01:47:10.223 --> 01:47:10.690
MEAN YOU KNOW STUFF LIKE

01:47:10.757 --> 01:47:13.426
PORTLAND HAS URBAN GROWTH

01:47:13.493 --> 01:47:13.927
BOUNDARY OF ANY OTHER.

01:47:13.994 --> 01:47:14.561
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO TO

01:47:14.628 --> 01:47:17.097
STATEWIDE LEVEL BUT IT IS A HUGE

01:47:17.164 --> 01:47:17.731
PROBLEM THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING

01:47:17.798 --> 01:47:21.401
ON THE GROUND.

01:47:21.468 --> 01:47:22.068
I THINK BEING THE FASTER ON THE

01:47:22.135 --> 01:47:22.702
WILD HEART ISSUES AS WELL RIGHT

01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:22.903
NOW.

01:47:22.969 --> 01:47:25.906
TO AND I WOULD JUST SAY I THINK

01:47:25.972 --> 01:47:26.540
AND GET A HIGHER LEVEL OF ANY

01:47:26.606 --> 01:47:27.040
ANY LEGISLATION AND AND

01:47:27.107 --> 01:47:30.076
SUBSEQUENT FUNDING THAT COMES

01:47:30.143 --> 01:47:30.744
DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL FROM THE

01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:30.977
STATE.

01:47:31.044 --> 01:47:31.545
ON ON ANY OF THESE HOUSING

01:47:31.611 --> 01:47:34.381
ISSUES CAN BE TIED TO OUR HAVE

01:47:34.447 --> 01:47:35.015
STRINGS ATTACHED THAT SAY IF

01:47:35.081 --> 01:47:38.418
YOUR LOCAL JURISDICTION DOESN'T

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:39.085
HAVE A CLIMATE ACTION PLAN OR IF

01:47:39.152 --> 01:47:42.189
YOU ARE HITTING THE X. Y. Z.

01:47:42.255 --> 01:47:42.455
POLICIES.

01:47:42.522 --> 01:47:42.989
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE

01:47:43.056 --> 01:47:43.590
ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING AND

01:47:43.657 --> 01:47:46.493
THAT'S A BIG A HOOK FOR LOCAL

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.093
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO WANT.

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:47.761
TO WHAT ARE THEY BELIEVE IN THIS

01:47:47.828 --> 01:47:50.864
AND REALLY SUPPORTED OR WHETHER

01:47:50.931 --> 01:47:51.464
I DO IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE.

01:47:51.531 --> 01:47:54.801
TO DOESN'T MATTER WHY THEY'RE

01:47:54.868 --> 01:47:55.468
DOING THE RIGHT THING AS LONG AS

01:47:55.535 --> 01:47:55.735
THEY ARE.

01:47:55.802 --> 01:47:56.436
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S GREAT BOTH

01:47:56.503 --> 01:47:58.905
THAT THAT'S OKAY FEEDBACK AND I

01:47:58.972 --> 01:47:59.472
THINK TO GET THAT LAST PART

01:47:59.539 --> 01:47:59.706
WHERE.

01:47:59.773 --> 01:48:00.307
THE GOVERNOR HAS REALLY BEEN

01:48:00.373 --> 01:48:03.276
INTERESTED IN TRYING TO

01:48:03.343 --> 01:48:03.910
INCENTIVIZE LOCAL CITIES TO DO

01:48:03.977 --> 01:48:04.544
MORE FOR THEIR PRODUCTION AGAIN

01:48:04.611 --> 01:48:07.647
THIS IS WHY THIS IS ON OUR

01:48:07.714 --> 01:48:08.315
AGENDA IS A THERE IS A CLEARLY.

01:48:08.381 --> 01:48:11.451
TO KINDA SO SUCH A HOUSING

01:48:11.518 --> 01:48:12.052
PRODUCTION BUT ABOUT THAT AND

01:48:12.118 --> 01:48:15.622
YOU DID EXACTLY RIGHT ON AYE AYE

01:48:15.689 --> 01:48:16.256
YOU GET TO COMMIT TO MEMORY BUT

01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:16.823
THE NEW -- THE ACRONYM FOR

01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:20.193
WILDFIRE INTERFACE AREAS I MEAN

01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:23.830
THEY START TO SPEAK TO GET WHERE

01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:24.364
SHOULD -- NEW HOUSING BE

01:48:24.431 --> 01:48:28.134
PRIORITIZED ARE PROHIBITED --

01:48:28.201 --> 01:48:28.702
THE GIVEN EXTREME COSTS TO

01:48:28.768 --> 01:48:29.236
TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE OF

01:48:29.302 --> 01:48:32.505
CALIFORNIA IT WAS OF THE

01:48:32.572 --> 01:48:33.206
WILDFIRES I THINK WE STARTED IT --

01:48:33.273 --> 01:48:36.610
REALLY GREAT THAT I HAVE AN

01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:37.244
APARTMENT CONVERSATION WHAT WILL

01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:40.714
WE OR SOMETHING CALLED CAN MAKE

01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:41.348
ONE FINAL COMMENT JUST TO ECHO.

01:48:41.414 --> 01:48:41.915
WHAT SHE REYES AND I TOTALLY

01:48:41.982 --> 01:48:44.818
AGREE WITH HER COMMENT -- AS A

01:48:44.885 --> 01:48:45.452
MEMBER OF THE STRATEGIC GROWTH

01:48:45.518 --> 01:48:46.086
COUNCIL WE ARE BEGINNING TO DO

01:48:46.152 --> 01:48:49.122
SOMETHING UNIQUE I BELIEVE AND

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.756
THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING

01:48:49.823 --> 01:48:53.059
AT WHERE THE STATE DOLLARS GO.

01:48:53.126 --> 01:48:53.660
AND WHETHER THOSE DOLLARS ARE

01:48:53.727 --> 01:48:57.230
TIED TO THE STATE'S CLIMATE PLAN

01:48:57.297 --> 01:48:57.864
FOR THE STATE'S KIND OF GOALS

01:48:57.931 --> 01:48:58.465
FOR THE FIRST TIME SO I CLOSE

01:48:58.531 --> 01:49:01.501
LIKE OR TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES.

01:49:01.568 --> 01:49:02.168
SO -- IT'LL BE INTERESTING BUT I

01:49:02.235 --> 01:49:05.772
THINK THAT'S ALSO GOING TO BE A

01:49:05.839 --> 01:49:06.406
HELPFUL DATA POINTS TO SEEK TO

01:49:06.473 --> 01:49:09.843
POTENTIALLY TIED DOLLARS.

01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:10.510
TO LOCAL REGIONS BASED ON ONE OF

01:49:10.577 --> 01:49:26.726
THEIR IMPROVING ON NOT IMPROVING

01:49:26.793 --> 01:49:26.993
CLIMATE.

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:30.997
ELECTIONS I DOES A GREAT SORT OF

01:49:31.064 --> 01:49:31.598
GENERALIZED GOES ON HOW WE TO

01:49:31.665 --> 01:49:32.232
SAY OPERATIONALIZE SOME OF THOSE

01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:35.235
INTO POLICY BUT THAT'S PART OF

01:49:35.302 --> 01:49:35.902
WHY WE HAVE -- AMAZING STAFF AND

01:49:35.969 --> 01:49:36.503
AND GREAT ATTORNEYS AND OTHER

01:49:36.569 --> 01:49:37.037
FOLKS TO MAYBE CAN HELP US

01:49:37.103 --> 01:49:39.172
FIGURE IT OUT -- AND AND THE

01:49:39.239 --> 01:49:39.739
CALL YOU YOU HAD A BUNCH OF

01:49:39.806 --> 01:49:40.407
INSTEAD OF A LARGE CONVERSATION

01:49:40.473 --> 01:49:41.007
LEGISLATURE THIS YOU KNOW HOW

01:49:41.074 --> 01:49:43.476
MUCH LOCAL CONTROL DO WE LEAVE

01:49:43.543 --> 01:49:44.077
IT HOW MUCH IS A STATE PARTY.

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:47.347
CLEARLY ARTICULATE THIS IS A

01:49:47.414 --> 01:49:47.981
MASSIVE STATEWIDE ISSUE NO ONE

01:49:48.048 --> 01:49:48.615
CITIES GOING TO SOLVE IT EVERY

01:49:48.682 --> 01:49:52.018
CITY HAS TO PARTICIPATE IN A AND

01:49:52.085 --> 01:49:52.585
I THINK GENERALLY SANDY WAS

01:49:52.652 --> 01:49:53.119
TRYING TO GO IN THE RIGHT

01:49:53.186 --> 01:49:53.420
DIRECTION.

01:49:53.486 --> 01:49:55.789
YOU HEARD FROM -- THE STAFF

01:49:55.855 --> 01:49:56.356
BEFORE WERE NOT MEETING OUR

01:49:56.423 --> 01:49:56.923
RESPONSIBILITIES BUT WE ARE

01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:59.893
TRYING THAT IS HONESTLY TRUE OF

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:00.427
EVERY CITY IN THE STATE.

01:50:00.493 --> 01:50:01.061
AND SO THAT DELICATE BALANCE OR

01:50:01.127 --> 01:50:01.695
ANYTHING YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION

01:50:01.761 --> 01:50:04.331
WITH -- OTHERS ARE UTILIZING

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:04.898
FEAR TRYING SCARED -- THIS

01:50:04.965 --> 01:50:05.498
CONVERSATION I ONE MOMENT FROM

01:50:05.565 --> 01:50:08.368
IT -- WE HAVE TO DO IT -- YOU

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:09.035
KNOW IF YOU'RE ASKING IF ANYONE

01:50:09.102 --> 01:50:09.669
IS SORT OF A CITY COUNCIL NO IF

01:50:09.736 --> 01:50:12.305
YOU ASK NEIGHBORHOOD TO TAKE A

01:50:12.372 --> 01:50:12.872
NEW DEVELOPMENT HAS TO THE

01:50:12.939 --> 01:50:13.473
EXPECTATION THAT OTHERS ARE

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:14.040
DOING THEIR FAIR SHARE AND

01:50:14.107 --> 01:50:14.674
THAT'S REALLY WHAT I THINK THIS

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:16.710
CONVERSATION IS ABOUT -- THAT SB

01:50:16.776 --> 01:50:17.177
FIFTY IS VERY ONGOING

01:50:17.243 --> 01:50:17.777
CONVERSATION I DON'T THINK SO

01:50:17.844 --> 01:50:20.981
THAT THE AUTHOR -- BUT OTHERS I

01:50:21.047 --> 01:50:21.648
DON'T SEE IT AS A AS A AS A DONE

01:50:21.715 --> 01:50:22.215
DEAL -- I THINK THAT WE CAN

I THANK YOU.

01:51:56.609 --> 01:51:57.243
MY NAME IS SUSAN BALDWIN AND NOT --

01:51:57.310 --> 01:51:57.777
I AM A RETIRED PLANNER WHO

01:51:57.844 --> 01:51:58.378
WORKED ON HOUSING ISSUES THAT

01:51:58.445 --> 01:52:00.713
SANDBAG.

01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:01.247
FOR ABOUT OVER TWENTY FIVE

01:52:01.314 --> 01:52:05.151
COMMENTS TO MAKE -- I UNDERSTAND.

01:52:05.218 --> 01:52:09.089
AND BELIEVE THAT THEY TRULY

01:52:09.155 --> 01:52:09.789
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A LOCK OF

01:52:09.856 --> 01:52:10.390
MODERATE INCOME HOUSING BEING

01:52:10.457 --> 01:52:13.393
BUILT.

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:13.993
STATEWIDE NOT NOT JUST IN THE

01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:17.664
CITY OF SAN DIEGO -- I WORKED ON

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:21.734
REPORTS THAT.

01:52:21.801 --> 01:52:22.368
COMPILED ALL THE DATA FROM THE

01:52:22.435 --> 01:52:26.072
CITY'S -- TO SHOW HOW MANY UNITS

01:52:26.139 --> 01:52:26.706
ARE HOW MANY BUILDING PERMITS

01:52:26.773 --> 01:52:29.943
HAVE BEEN ISSUED.

01:52:30.009 --> 01:52:30.610
AND I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

01:52:30.677 --> 01:52:34.380
TOO IS THAT THE THE INFORMATION

01:52:34.447 --> 01:52:34.914
ABOUT MODERATE INCOME.

01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:38.785
MODERATE INCOME HOUSING ISN'T TO

01:52:38.852 --> 01:52:39.119
WELL DEFINED.

01:52:39.185 --> 01:52:42.455
AND SO I THINK.

01:52:42.522 --> 01:52:46.726
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO

01:52:46.793 --> 01:52:47.360
PROVIDE CLEAR INFORMATION ABOUT

01:52:47.427 --> 01:52:50.964
WHAT IS MODERATE INCOME SCENE.

01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.598
AND WHAT ARE AFFORDABLE RENTS

01:52:51.664 --> 01:52:55.301
AND PRICES FOR MODERATE INCOME

01:52:55.368 --> 01:52:59.172
HOUSEHOLDS TO AFFORD.

01:52:59.239 --> 01:52:59.839
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN OF SOME REASON

01:52:59.906 --> 01:53:03.510
HEARINGS -- AT THE COUNTY WHEN

01:53:03.576 --> 01:53:04.177
DEVELOPERS ARE SAYING THAT THEY

01:53:04.244 --> 01:53:07.814
ARE BUILDING FIVE HUNDRED AND

01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:08.414
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR HOMES.

01:53:08.481 --> 01:53:11.885
AND THEY ARE SAYING THAT THOSE

01:53:11.951 --> 01:53:12.385
ARE FOR MODERATE INCOME

01:53:12.452 --> 01:53:12.685
HOUSEHOLDS.

01:53:12.752 --> 01:53:15.855
AND THAT.

01:53:15.922 --> 01:53:16.422
JUST ISN'T TRUE A MODERATE

01:53:16.489 --> 01:53:17.056
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AT THE UPPER

01:53:17.123 --> 01:53:24.130
END FOUR FOUR PERSON FAMILY IS --

01:53:24.197 --> 01:53:24.764
NINETY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND

01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:25.398
A FAMILY MAKING THAT MUCH MONEY

01:53:25.465 --> 01:53:28.801
CAN AFFORD ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

01:53:28.868 --> 01:53:29.435
AND TWENTY TO THREE HUNDRED AND

01:53:29.502 --> 01:53:32.572
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:33.206
SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE CLEAR

01:53:33.273 --> 01:53:33.439
ABOUT.

01:53:33.506 --> 01:53:36.843
WHAT MODERATE INCOME HOUSING IS

01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:37.377
AND WHO CAN AFFORD IT?

01:53:37.443 --> 01:53:41.181
AND MY OTHER -- POINT IS THAT

01:53:41.247 --> 01:53:44.951
WHEN MODERATE INCOME HOUSING IS

01:53:45.018 --> 01:53:45.552
PROVIDED AND I I'M GETTING TO

01:53:45.618 --> 01:53:46.186
THE POINT WHERE I THINK IT HAS

01:53:46.252 --> 01:53:49.255
TO BE.

01:53:49.322 --> 01:53:49.756
DELIVERED IT HAS TO BE

01:53:49.822 --> 01:53:50.423
SUBSIDIZED IN SOME WAY OR IT'S

01:53:50.490 --> 01:53:53.793
NOT GOING TO BE PROVIDED.

01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:54.460
AND I THINK THAT -- THERE NEED

01:53:54.527 --> 01:53:57.830
TO BE DEED RESTRICTIONS TO

01:53:57.897 --> 01:54:01.834
ENSURE LONG TERM IN

01:54:01.901 --> 01:54:02.435
AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE WITHOUT

01:54:02.502 --> 01:54:05.872
THOSE DEED RESTRICTIONS.

01:54:05.939 --> 01:54:06.439
THOSE UNITS WILL NOT STAY

01:54:06.506 --> 01:54:07.006
