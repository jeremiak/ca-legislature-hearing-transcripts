I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE TODAY THANK YOU AB TWENTY TO THIRTY FOUR WHAT PROVIDE STUDENTS WHO ARE TESTIFYING IN EMPLOYEE DISMISSAL HEARING. THAT INVOLVED DEGREE JUST ACTS WHICH SIMILAR WITNESS PROTECTION THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO MINORS AND OTHER LEGAL SETTING. THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. QUESTION DO YOU THEY CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION OR VIDEOTAPED DEPOSITION. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO AN IN HEARING TESTIMONY BY ITS STUDENT THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT A SUPPORT PERSON BE APPOINTED TO EACH CHILD WITNESS TO ACCOMPANY THEM THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. ALLOWING THE USE OF THESE PROTECTIONS WILL REDUCE THE RISK OF TRAUMA THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN VICTIMS FACED THEIR ABUSER. TO ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE I HAVE CHERRY MO AND ATTORNEY WITH THE LAW STANDS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT GATE. THESE CLASSIFIED AND CERTIFICATED DISMISSAL MATTERS. INCLUDING AGREED JUST ONLY CASES I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE BEEN A THINKER CAN VARY FROM THE SPELL. THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORTS. RIGHT SEEN DOES THAT ARE THERE ANY WOODS IS IN OPPOSITION. BEEN GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE A COUNSELOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. THING YOU TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS WITH AB TWENTY TO THIRTY FOUR. AYE WE CURRENTLY HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LET'S AMENDED POSITION BUT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS HIGH LOOKS GOOD AND SO WILL REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. A WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT AB TWENTY TO THIRTY FOUR IS LIMITED TO CASES OF EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT. AS WELL AS THESE CASES BEING HEARD BEFORE AND ALJ OR ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE WE ALSO WE ALSO WANT A SHIRT THAT THE EXCLUSIVE WRAP IT IS. AUTHORIZED TO REPRESENT OUR MEMBERS IN THESE TYPE OF HEARINGS AND WE ONLY WANT. REP RELEVANT EVIDENCE CODE TO APPLY TO THESE CASES OUT WE ARE. ALSO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO REMOVE OUR AND. OPPOSITION THINK IT. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THAT BRAMBLE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWO TWO THREE FOUR. ASK ANY EDUCATOR WHY THEY CHOSE TO WORK IN SCHOOLS AND. THEY'LL ANSWER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. ARE THEY BELIEVE AND CHILDREN EDUCATION IS MORE THAN A JOB THAT IT TRULY IS A CALLING AND WHILE CALIFORNIA FACES A TEACHER SHORTAGE. WE CONTINUE TO SEE PROPOSALS WHICH. OUR FOCUS ON THE FIRING RATHER THAN THE HIRING OF EDUCATORS. TO DISAPPOINTING WE'VE BROUGHT WITH US. BETH CURTIS WHO HAS MORE EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA AND CAN GO THROUGH SOME OF THE DETAILS. OF OUR OPPOSITION BUT WE DO URGE YOUR NO VOTE. I CAN'T. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS LESLIE BETH CURTIS I'M AN ATTORNEY HERE IN SACRAMENTO WITH THE LAW FIRM OF. LIKING CAN'T CURTIS AND PRICE I'M WHAT'S CALLED A GROUP LEGAL SERVICES ATTORNEY THAT MEANS THAT I HAVE A CONTRACT WITH C. CHAIR AND I REPRESENT. MEMBERS BUT IN ALL KINDS OF ISSUES BUT INCLUDING TEACHERS AND DISMISSAL HEARINGS. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS AND I WOULD SAY MOST OF THE REPRESENTATION THAT I DO IN MY PRACTICES FOR TEACHERS. THERE'S A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL ITEMS IN THE BILL THAT BECAUSE CITY IS CONCERNED. BUT I GUESS BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT I JUST SORT OF WANTED TO ADDRESS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. AYE I THINK THE BILL CREATES A IMAGE THAT THERE ARE CTA ATTORNEY'S CROSS EXAMINING. CHILDREN AND CAUSING THEM TO BREAK INTO TEARS AROUND THE STATE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT'S NOT. THE CASE MY TWENTY ONE YEARS I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO NEVER HAVE TO QUESTION A CHILD WITNESS MY PARTNER. HOUSE QUESTION CHILD WITNESSES IN A CASE THAT WAS. IN THE SACRAMENTO BEE THAT LOBBY ON A CASE WHERE A. TEACHER GOT IN BETWEEN TWO STUDENTS TO BREAK UP A FIGHT AND SO. I HAD TO WHAT THERE IS A HE WAS BEING A CHOKED BY ONE OF THE STUDENTS. A BIT THAT STUDENTS ARM TO STOP THE CHOKEHOLD AND A TERMINATION ENSUED AND WE REPRESENTED MR BLOBBY ON I WON AND WON THAT CASE BUT UNDER THE. BROAD DEFINITION OF EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT IN THE THE ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE GREGIS MISCONDUCT BUT THE DEFINITION IS ACTUALLY. BROADER THAN THE ANALYSIS RECOGNIZES AGREE JUST MISCONDUCT BECAUSE IT LISTS THOSE PENAL CODE SECTIONS WOULD ALSO INCLUDE ANY ALLEGATION OF CORPORAL PUNISHMENT. SO PART OF SEATED IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL IS THE THE CURRENT BREATH THAT THE BILL IF THE BILL IS LIMITED TO. EDUCATION CODE DISMISSALS THAT ONLY INVOLVE AGREE JUST MISCONDUCT. UGH I THINK THAT WOULD UNDO SOME OF THE. CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL BUT THE CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS IF IT APPLIES TO ALL DISMISSAL HEARINGS IN WHICH ANY ALLEGATION OF EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT IS MADE. IT'S GOING TO MAKE THOSE HEARINGS A MORE TIME CONSUMING AND MORE EXPENSIVE AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF AB TWO FIFTEEN. THERE WAS PASSED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WAS THAT PART OF THE OVERWHELMING GOAL THERE WAS TO MAKE TEACHER DISMISSAL HEARINGS LESS EXPENSIVE. AND QUICKER FOR THE BENEFIT OF TEACHERS AND THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC. AND ANYTIME THAT YOU START ADDING ADDITIONAL HEARINGS INTO THE TEACHER DISMISSAL PROCESS YOU RATCHET UP THE COST AND YOU RATCHET UP THE TIME. AND SO THE WAY THIS BILL IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN UNDER FOUR FOUR NINE NINE ZERO FIRST YOU HAVE A HEARING TO DETERMINE IF THE CHILD WITNESS NEEDS CHILD ADVOCATES. BUT THEN IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE ANOTHER HEARING IN FRONT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE TO DETERMINE IF THEY. CHILD WITNESS SHOULD TESTIFY BY CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION ONLY YOU COULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL HEARING TO DETERMINE WHO THE CHILD ADVOCATES ARE GOING TO BE. AND YOU COULD HAVE A POTENTIAL HEARING TO DETERMINE IF THE CHILD SHOULD TESTIFY. THROUGH DEPOSITION ONLY AND SO ALL OF THESE HEARINGS ARE GOING TO REQUIRE BRIEFING AN ADDITIONAL TIME AN ADDITIONAL WORK BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. THE DEFINITION OF MINER AND FOUR FOUR NINE NINE ZERO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN WOULD INCLUDE EVERY PERSON UNDER AGE EIGHTEEN AND SO. THAT APPEARS TO ENCOMPASS NOT ONLY THE ALLEGED CHILD VICTIM IN A DISMISSAL HEARING BUT EVERY STUDENT WHO MAY BE CALLED AT ANY POINT AS A WITNESS SO IN THE CASE THAT I MENTIONED THE GLOVE YANO CASE. YOU HAD THE TWO STUDENTS INVOLVED IN THE FIGHT BUT THEN YOU HAD EVERY CHILD NOT P. CLASSROOM WHO OBSERVED. THE FIGHT OF WHAT HAPPENED AND YOU WERE ASKED TO TESTIFY ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW AND SO IT'S NOT CLEAR FROM THE BILL AS WRITTEN. WOULD EVERYONE OF THOSE STUDENT WITNESSES HAVE A CHILD OUT THE KID IF SO. BUT NOW YOU'RE HEARING IS BALLOONING IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE TIME. AND I DO NEED TO TO WRAP UP THE YES. SO OF WEALTH SEAT WHILE CITY IS OPPOSING THE BILL I THINK. Y. CLEAR LIMITING OF THE BILL TWO FOUR FOUR NINE THREE FOUR POINT ONE CASES OF GREGIS MISCONDUCT ONLY. I WOULD HOPE THAT AND I ALSO THINK OF REMOVING THE. DEPOSITION ONLY TESTIMONY A IDEA SO THAT THE RESPONDENT TRULY WOULD BE AFFORDED THE RIGHT TO CROSS EXAMINE THE WITNESSES AGAINST HIM. THAT WOULD HELP THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANIMALS LIKE TO WAIT IN SUPPORT. THAT'S OUR OPPOSITION I WOULD POST DATA BUT OKAY. THANK YOU. SO JUST WHERE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE OPPOSITION. ANYONE ELSE IN IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT SING NONE. BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SO IT IT. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE SPELL IN AND TRIED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS I KNOW INSURGENTS OR THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THAT AS WELL. AND SIR OUR QUESTIONS PERHAPS YOU COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND THEN. WHERE YOU INTEND TO? I GO WITH THE SPELLS OF ASSORTED DOES RECOMMENDED TO PASS. RECOMMENDATION HERE BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BUT THIS IS ALWAYS A DELICATE ISSUE AND I KNOW YOUR GOAL HERE IS TO TRY AND PROTECT CHILDREN WHICH IS. I BRADLEY LAUDABLE AND AN OUR OUR MAIN GOAL IS NOT BE PREGNANT WITH YOU AND A REASON FOR ALL OF THE DIFFERENT STEPS IS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT STUDENTS. BUT ALSO TO PROTECT THE TEACHERS TO INSURE THAT THERE ISN'T NO FALSE ACCUSATIONS. BOB THIS IS ABOUT THE MOST EGREGIOUS TEACHERS THAT ARE OUT THERE WHICH I THINK OF IT'S A VERY SMALL NUMBER SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GO AFTER THE MAJORITY OF LA UNIFIED. ESPECIALLY SINCE MY DAUGHTER'S TEACHER MY FUNDED FUTURE MY EX WIFE TO TAKE YOUR WORD ON ABOUT THE THIRD ONE BUT ANYWAY. AND I KNOW THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE AND I KNOW THEY DAY WENT INTO THAT PROFESSION TO DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT THERE THOSE UNFORTUNATELY THAT HAVE BEEN PROBLEMATIC AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IS TO. A CHILD THAT FIRST. AND THAT WE AFFORD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE TO BE ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD BE DONE. OF AN OPEN CLAYCOURT NETTING INCLUDES SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS CAN BE ABUSED IN WAYS THAT ARE. LIKE A VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM WITH THE ACCUSER AND SO THE STEP THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT. I'M I WILL. WORK WITH EVERYONE THAT IN OPPOSITION MAKE SURE WE DON'T IT COULD BECOME TO BROUGHT IT WE NARROW IT DOWN COOKS WE TRULY TRULY TRULY. WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN A VERY MODIFICATION IS APPLE IN MY DISTRICT. I WOULD NOT WANT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. STUDENT TO BE IN THERE WAS SOMEONE THAT HAS DONE SOME THE MOST EGREGIOUS ACTS OF GOD CAN EVEN MENTION IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW. AND SO THE POINT OF IT IS THAT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE IN THE SAME ROOM. WITS WITH THE SEXUAL ABUSER THAT. THEY CAME FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I THINK CTA AND AND THE OTHER GROUPS AGREE AND SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO IS FIGURE OUT A FORMAT WHAT BOTH SIDES. ARE ARE ABLE TO. HAVE JUSTICE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE OF. THAT WE DO THIS CHILDREN FIRST. THANK YOU. RIGHT WE DON'T YET HAVE COR I THINK THAT IS YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU HAVE WE DON'T HAVE QUORUM WILL TAKE THIS BILL UP ONCE WE DO. THANK YOU. SO ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY FIVE. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU CHAIR A COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL.

ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE LEGISLATURE UPDATED THE PROCESS FOR DISMISSALS OF PERMANENT SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. THE PASSAGE OF AB TWO FIFTEEN. THAT BILL AMONG OTHER THINGS CREATED AN EXPEDITED PROCESS FOR REMOVAL OF SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE COMMITTED. EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT AND ADDED TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WITH REGARD TO DISCLOSING AND REPORTING EGRI JUST MISCONDUCT AND MAINTAINING EVIDENCE. IN EMPLOYEES FILE. AB TWO FIFTEEN I PROVIDED THE FRAMEWORK NEEDED TO PROTECT STUDENTS FROM SERIOUS FORMS OF MISCONDUCT BY GIVING LOCAL SCHOOL OFFICIALS A MECHANISM TO ASSURE AN OFFENDING EMPLOYEES PROMPT REMOVAL. FROM THE CLASSROOM. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THAT BILL HOWEVER. SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND GOVERNING BOARDS. EXPRESSED CONCERN. BUT THE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS MISCONDUCT INVOLVING SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR WITH STUDENTS. AS A RESULT THERE ARE SOME SCHOOL EMPLOYEES THAT ARE STAYING IN THE CLASSROOM EVEN AFTER NUMEROUS ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. TODAY'S BILL. HAS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE AND FURTHER THE PURPOSE OF AB TWO FIFTEEN BY ALLOWING LOCAL SCHOOL OFFICIALS TO CONSIDER A PERMANENT EMPLOYEES HISTORY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. OR OTHER OKAY OTHER INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR WITH A STUDENT IN A DISMISSAL HEARING. EXISTING LAW ONLY ALLOWS EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY THE DATES BACK FOUR YEARS EXCEPT IN THE MOST SERIOUS INSTANCES. OF ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT OR CHILD ABUSE TODAY'S BILL WOULD ALSO ALLOW EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR OTHER INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR EVEN IF IT IS OLDER THAN FOUR YEARS TO BE PRESENTED IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A PATTERN. OF MISCONDUCT. TODAY'S BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN MEETING TO PRESSING SOCIAL CHALLENGES. MAKING OUR SCHOOLS SAFER AND ROOTING OUT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY EIGHT MAKES COMMON SENSE CHANGES TO STRENGTHEN THE EXISTING PETER DISMISSAL STATUTE.

WE TRY TO TAKE ACTION IMMEDIATELY. UNDER CURRENT LAW IF EMPLOYEE ENGAGES IN INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL CONDUCT THAT DOES NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR WERE REALLY LIMITED THE DISCIPLINE THAT WE CAN APPLY. IN A DISMISSAL HEARING WE WE CAN ONLY USE INSTANCES MISTER COLLEGES SHARED WITH YOU. THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS. WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH A CASE THIS YEAR. IN WHICH THE TEACHER HAS A HISTORY OF INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR BUT HE STAGGERED THE INCIDENTS SO THAT ONLY THE MOST RECENT CASE QUALIFIES UNDER THAT. IF A LOT ALLOWED US TO PRESENT HIS ENTIRE EMPLOYMENT HISTORY. WE COULD SHOW A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR AND ATTEMPTS AT REMEDIATION THAT WOULD LEAD ANYONE TO ASSUME THAT THE EMPLOYEE IS AN ONGOING THREAT. TO STUDENT SAFETY WITH THE FOR YOUR LIMITATION ARE CASES IT NEARLY AS COMPELLING AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT. BECAUSE OF THE FOR YOUR ROLE ATTORNEYS REGULARLY BY SCHOOL DISTRICT TO PURSUE DISCIPLINE SHORT OF DISMISSAL. UNLESS THERE'S BEEN TRULY EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR I DON'T THINK WITH THE INTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROTECT THE PETA FILE OR SEXUAL HARASSER.

ADDRESS THAT VERY NARROW ISSUE AT HAND AND WITH ME HAVE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE MR TURN MEMBERS ARE NAY MORE REPRESENTING CHARO IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TUROW'S A PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING PLATFORM HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA. OWNERS OF VEHICLES OPPOSE THEIR VEHICLES ON OUR WEBSITE FOR POTENTIAL USERS AND IN EXCHANGE WE TAKE A FEE. FROM THE OWNER PROVIDE INSURANCE FOR BOTH PARTIES AND PER TWENTY TWO AT TEN CALIFORNIA LAW DEFINING IN ESTABLISHING THE REQUIREMENTS THIS TRANSACTION. WE ASSUME ALL OF THE LIABILITY OF THE OWNER DURING THE TIME THAT VEHICLE IS BEING DRIVEN AS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION. THE ARGUMENTS FOR PASSAGE OF THIS LAW AND TWENTY TWENTY TEN WHERE THAT THESE MODELS PROVIDE FOR ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FROM ABILITY. ALLOW PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE CARS TO USE THEM WHEN THEY REALLY NEED THEM AND TO GENERALLY PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO FULL TIME VEHICLE OWNERSHIP. I WHICH IS SHOWN BY BEEN SHUNNED BY NUMBER OF STUDIES TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LAST YEAR MORE THAN A MILLION CALIFORNIANS SIGNED UP TO USED HER AS WEBSITE. THESE PLATFORMS ARE ARE DISTINGUISHED BY FROM RENTAL CAR AGENCIES BY AT LEAST THREE DISTINCT COMPONENTS ONE THEY PROVIDE A SERVICE TO CONNECT OWNER CUSTOMERS AND DRIVER CUSTOMERS. BUT UNLIKE RENTAL CAR AGENCIES DO NOT OWN A FLEET THEMSELVES. SECOND THEY HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD OF LIABILITY THE RENTAL CAR AGENCIES CALIFORNIA LAW SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES THESE COMPANIES TAKE ON THE LIABILITY OF THE VEHICLE OWNER. FROM THE TIME THE KEYS ARE TRANSFERRED FROM OWNER DRIVER. AND RENTAL CAR AGENCIES HAVE AN EXPLICIT EXEMPTION FEDERAL LAW FROM THAT BY CARRIER VICARIOUS LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE IS THAT CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING COMPANIES PROVIDE INSURANCE TO BOTH THE OWNER AND THE DRIVER.

THAT REQUIRES RENTAL CAR COMPANIES TO ENSURE THAT THEIR VEHICLES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO A SAFETY RECALL IN THAT ANY SAFETY RECALL THE FACTS HAVE BEEN REPAIRED. AND THEN WE ALSO. WORKED WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORDON ON LEGISLATION THAT HE AMENDED. THAT. TIGHTENED CALIFORNIA LAW. REGARDING THAT IN THIS BILL WE BELIEVE AS. PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. WILL ENSURE THAT WHEN CONSUMERS ARE GETTING VEHICLES OR. A RIDE SHARING ENTITY LIKED HER OR GET AROUND THAT THEY HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF SAFETY. AND. WILL WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ON FINE TUNING SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN THERE WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE. ANALYSIS WHICH WE REALLY APPRECIATE IS VERY THOROUGH AND IT SPECIFIES THAT A MANUFACTURER'S RECALLS A RECALL CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL LAW. THAT APPLIES ONLY TO SAFETY RECALLS. AND THAT IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE A SERVICE CAMPAIGN WHICH IS WHY IT IS DONE FOR LESSER KINDS OF PROBLEMS THAT AREN'T SAFETY RELATED. OR EMISSIONS RECALLS RICHARD. DIFFERENT CATEGORY OF RECALL. THIS WOULD APPLY ONLY TO. SAFETY RECALLS WHETHER. OR WHERE THE VEHICLE EITHER FAILS TO COMPLY THE FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARD OR WHERE.

AND LANGUAGE HAD BEEN. DISCUSSED IN CONCEPT IT ENDED UP NOT BEING INCLUDED IN WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAS. DECIDED TO DO IT THIS TIME. BUT. AIRPORTS ARE CONCERNED. ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT AIRPORTS HAVE ISSUED CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS TO TURN ROSE SPECIFICALLY. NONE OF THOSE HAVE BEEN HONORED TO DATE AND THEY'RE CURRENTLY ADVERTISING THEIR SERVICES TO AIRPORT PASSENGERS AT MOST OF THE LARGER AIRPORTS IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE GOING TO EVALUATE THE LANGUAGE THAT THE COMMITTEE IT HASN'T. DISCUSSED TODAY HOWEVER WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A COMMERCIAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE. IN THE CONTEXT OF ONE ONE FIVE EIGHT ZERO POINT TWO FOUR OF THE INSURANCE CODE WHICH CLEARLY STATES THAT THAT. PRIVATE CAR SHARING PROGRAM AUTHORIZED BY THAT SECTION IS FOR NON COMMERCIAL USES ONLY SO. THAT WE AT THAT CAUSES US SOME CONCERN AND. WILL CONTINUE WITH THE DISCUSSION BUT WE CERTAINLY DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS OFFICE IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF WHO WE BELIEVE WORK QUITE HARD TO TRY AND. FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ENSURE THAT AIRPORT COMPLIANCE IS REQUIRED. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERSHIP INVESTMENT ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS. WE HAVE FIVE THOUSAND BROWN APARTMENT FIVE THOUSAND MEMBERS WORKING IN THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL ON ON THEIR JOBS IN THE VIABILITY OF THEIR WORK. WE BELIEVE THAT. THE ENTITY THAT THIS BILL WOULD. BASICALLY AUTHORIZED IN LAW IS A RENTAL CAR COMPANY AND WHAT COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THEM WITH NOT ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT RENTAL CAR COMPANIES ARE. ARE BASED ON FEDERAL LAW STATE LAW ETCETERA AND. WE THINK THAT COULD CREATE AN UNLEVEL PLAYING FIELD AGAIN PUTTING THOSE JOBS IN JEOPARDY WE WILL LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS WE HAVEN'T. REVIEW DAM. AT THAT BUT AT THIS MOMENT WERE STILL POST THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT US WITH GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR JOHN MOFFETT ON BEHALF OF ENTERPRISE WE WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AND PRINT. ON THE THE BILL BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY I THINK. WE'RE EVALUATING IT WE HAVE IT PROBABLY RAISES MORE QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AN ANSWER. YOU KNOW THE THE GORDON BILL WHEN IT PASSED WAS INTENDED TO OF APPLIED TO A FLEET OF ONE. AND WAS INTENDED TO APPLY TO SITUATIONS LIKE THIS SO BY MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION AND DEFINING PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING. AS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN RENTAL CAR ARE WE A ARE WE CREATING UP AN ADDITIONAL LOOPHOLE ARE WE CREATING A CONFLICT IN THE LAW WHERE NINE SHOULD REALLY. REALISTICALLY EXIST RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THAT LAW SHOULD APPLY. TO THESE RENTAL TRANSACTIONS. THE E. ALSO SO THAT'S A QUESTION THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT LOOKING THROUGH TRYING TO ANSWER. IN ADDITION HOW DOES THIS LAW INTERACT WITH FEDERAL LAW WHICH APPLIES TO FLEETS. WE KNOW THAT THAT DESPITE THE PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING A DEFINITION IN THE BILL OR IS PROPOSED TO BE IN THE BILL WE KNOW THERE ARE FOLKS PUTTING. FLEETS ON THESE PLATFORMS. HOW DOES THE SUPPLIER THEY SUBJECT TO FEDERAL LAW THEY NOW SUBJECT TO THIS LAW? HOW DO WE HANDLE FLEETS MOVING FORWARD AND IS THAT TRULY PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING WHEN SOMEONE'S OFFERING FIVE TEN VEHICLES? WHAT IF IT'S ONE PERSON OFFERING ONE VEHICLE THAT'S RENTED OUT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAYS A YEAR? IS THAT PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING OR IS THAT PERSONAL VEHICLE RENTAL. AND SO THESE ARE ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT WE HAVE WE WE A APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE IN THEIR DESIRE TO PRESERVE THIS BROADER DISCUSSION. WE THINK IT'S A DISCUSSION THAT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN THAT. AND WE WE. ARE LOOKING AT THE BILL AND TRYING TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE BILL AS PROPOSED TODAY ACTUALLY PREJUDICES THAT DISCUSSION MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE THAT JON ROSS ON BEHALF OF THE HERTZ CORPORATION IN OPPOSITION. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION RUSSELL'S. THANK YOU. BY THIS IS AN INTERESTING SITUATION THAT WE FIND OURSELVES AND BECAUSE THERE ARE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF AMENDMENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY IN THE WORKS. THAT WILL BE TAKEN I BELIEVE IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE WHICH IS PRIVACY. AND MY HOPE IS THAT WE MOVE THIS ALONG BUT I CAN ALSO APPRECIATE. THE POSITION THAT THIS PUTS EVERYONE AND SINCE WE SINCE WE NOW HAVE NECESSARILY DEFINE IT AND WHAT THE AMENDMENTS WILL DO IS IS SIGNIFICANTLY SCALE THIS BILL BACK. AND THE REASON IS IN THE REASON ACTUALLY GO TO SOME OF THE TESTIMONY THAT WAS TALK HERE TODAY. BECAUSE THIS WAS BROUGHT AND NO WAS BROUGHT TO THE AUTHOR. A LONG LINE OF PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARE. BUT IN FACT AS WE TALKED WITH THE COMPANIES AS WE LOOKED AT THE AT THE SITUATION. TURNS OUT THAT THE PLATFORM'S TEND TO BE USED MORE FOR FLEETS THAN FOR PERSONAL VEHICLES ARE AND BECAUSE WE CREATED A STATUE FOR PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING. AND WITH A STATUE FOR RENTAL CAR COMPANIES THE OPPOSITION CORRECT THAT THAT WE'RE WE'RE NOW BLENDING THESE IN. OR THE POTENTIAL FOR WHEN THIS BILL FIRST CAME UP AS WELL AS MS FRIEDMAN SPELL. KIND BLENDING THESE TWO STATUTORY CONCEPTS IN A IN AN AWKWARD WAY WITHOUT REALLY HAVING THOUGHT IT THROUGH AND SO IF THE PLATFORMS TRULY FOR PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING THAT'S ONE THING AND I THINK THAT WAS WHAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT WAS I DON'T SPEAK FOR YOU MISTER LOWE BUT WE YOU. AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS. AND THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT WHEN THIS CAME IN BUT THE MORE. THAT THE PLATFORM IS TO SALUTED IN LARGE FLEETS THE MORE IT LOOKS LIKE RAILCAR COMPANY AND AND WHY WERE CONFUSING THE TO AND CREATE A STATUTORY FRAMEWORK THAT HAS TWO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES TO BASICALLY DO THE SAME BANG. I I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULD NECESSARILY DO THAT SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO GET DONE. FROM MY STANDPOINT. A VERY JUST IN THE PLATFORM AND INTERESTED IN THE POTENTIAL AND WANT TO SEE THIS MOVE FORWARD THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN AYE RECOMMENDATION AND THAT'S BASED ON A LOT OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR IN HIS FRIEDMAN WHO WAS. VERY MUCH A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE HER BILL IS APROPOS TO THIS. REALLY LEND TO THAT TO THAT CONVERSATION WE NEED TO WHATEVER WE DO BUILDING IN. CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IS IMPORTANT IN THIS CONVERSATION AND HENCE THE RECALL PROVISIONS THAT WILL STAY HERE AND AND THAT'S ONE OF THE. IMPORTANT PIECES THAT THAT'S GOING TO MOVE FORWARD BUT I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO GET A BETTER HANDLE ON HOW THESE PLATFORMS ARE ACTUALLY BEING. WHAT THEY REPRESENTS AND PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE TALKING TO THE RENTAL CAR COMPANIES ABOUT? THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE TO GO BECAUSE THEY OBVIOUSLY COME TO THIS TABLE WITH A WHOLE HISTORY. OF STATUTORY. AND REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS AND CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE BUILT UP OVER THE YEARS NOW THERE'S A NEW PLATFORM. AND I DON'T WANNA GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COMPETITION THAT THIS REPRESENTS NOR DO WE GET ONE TO GET IN THE MIDDLE. OF THE EXISTING LAWSUIT THAT IS OUT THERE BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND THE AIRPORT AND I'M NOT SURE ALL THAT THE THE PARTIES ARE THAT'S NOT THE INTENT AND. THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT INTERFERES WITH OR DIRECT THE COURT'S BORN EXISTING LITIGATION IF THERE'S THE. LITIGATION THAT NEEDS TO GET SORTED OUT IF WE DISAGREE WITH THE RESULT WE THEN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND INSTRUCT THE COURT. THROUGH OUR NORMAL PROCESS IS THIS IS HOW WE THINK YOU GOT THAT WRONG. BUT WE SHOULDN'T BE SET UP TO TO TRY AND INTERFERE. THE AMENDMENTS ARE GOING TO SORT OF RESET ALL OF THAT TAKE IT BACK TO ITS SIMPLEST FORM. AND THE REASON THAT THIS COULD DISCUSSION NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD IS THAT WE WE NEED THE TIME AND WE NEED THE SPACE TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS. THESE THESE NEW FRAMEWORKS WHERE THESE PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING. PLATFORMS ARE NOW BEING USED WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE USED FOR AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT NECESSARILY MOVING TO FLEET OPERATIONS IS A BAD THING. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE STATUTE WAS CREATED FOR IT WAS CREATED FOR PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARE. AND WE EITHER HONOR THAT OR WE LOOK AT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND TRY AND CREATE A BETTER FRAMEWORK FOR VEHICLES TO BE SHARED WHETHER ITS THROUGH. SOMETHING THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE RENTAL CAR COMPANIES OR THROUGH. INNOVATIVE APPS THAT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE OUT THERE. ALL THAT THE ABOUT SO THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE ARE. IT'S AN INTERESTING PROCESS WE'VE BEEN VERY ENGAGED IN THIS AND THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO SEE IT MOVE FORWARD DOES ENJOY DO PASS. RECOMMENDATION WITHOUT THE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET ALL OF THAT IN THIS WAS. A MOVING. HARD IT'S I DON'T EVER WANT TO SAY TRUST ME AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRUST US ON THIS. BUT. THERE HAS BEEN ALL OUT BATTLE LA WORKED AND THERE'LL BE A LOT OF WORK DONE IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE AND I THINK. GETTING OUR HANDS AROUND THIS SLOWING IT DOWN SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT IMPACTS IS. IS WHAT WE'RE ABOUT AT THIS POINT. SO QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER CHIU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING YOU FOR THAT. NOT GOOD SUMMARY OF WHERE WE ARE I DO THINK THIS OF BILL BRINGS UP A A NUMBER OF FASCINATING ISSUES THAT. AS THE LEGISLATURE WE OUGHT TO GRAPPLE WITH I DO HAVE A QUESTION. RELATED TO THE LAWSUIT THAT MY CITY I HAS BROUGHT AGAINST TORO. AND I JUST WANT TO READ PARTS OF THE ANALYSIS. IT. INITIALLY IS DRAFTED. AS A STATE IN THE ANALYSIS. IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW. THE THE BILL WAS INTENDED TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN INTERFERE WITH THE PENDING LITIGATION AND THAT'S HOW IT'S DRAFTED BUT THAT BEING SAID MY UNDERSTANDING IS. THAT THE AUTHORS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. DOES REFLECT THE AUTHOR'S AGREEMENT TO AVOID INTERFERING WITH THE PENDING LITIGATION WITH THIS BILL AND INSTEAD TO PROCEED WITH RELATIVELY NON CONTROVERSIAL PROVISIONS. ON SAFETY RECALL I JUST WANT TO. UNDERSTAND ON THE RECORD THAT THAT IS YOUR INTENT YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO IMPACT THE LAWSUIT BETWEEN MY CITY AND. AND TOWARD THE STOCK THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AND OUT WITH THE INDULGENCE OF THE CHAIR AND WORKING WITH A KEY STAKEHOLDERS THAT IS CERTAINLY THE INTENT AND THE BUT THE LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE. IS JUST SPECIFICALLY ON THAT OF OF THE RECALL. TO INSURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED IN THAT TRANSPORTATION OF THAT IS THAT IS CONVENE THROUGH THIS APPLICATION IS ALSO SUBJECTED TO THE SAME PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR CONSUMERS WITH RESPECT TO RECALL SO IT'S VERY NARROW IN SCOPE. AND AGAIN W. DUE RESPECT THAT OF THE LAWSUIT AND DO NOT WANT TO HAVE ANY TYPE OF THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WE GET AND IN THE WAY OF THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT AND. AND AND AND CERTAINLY MY READING OF THE ANALYSIS IN THE BILL AND AND YOU'RE REPRESENTATION AND ALSO THIS COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS. UP MAKES ME FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THAT IS THE CASE IF IT TURNS OUT AT SOME POINT DOWN THE LINE IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THERE ARE SOME WHO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO. CLARIFY THIS MORE EXPLICITLY ARE YOU YOU OPEN TO LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT TO TOUCH. THE LITIGATION YES GREAT I'M SO WITH THAT A I AM PREPARED TO SUPPORT US ELISE MOVING THIS FORWARD AT THIS TIME WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING AND CERTAINLY WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED DISCUSSION AND. IN SUBSEQUENT DATA COMMITTEES. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND DECEMBER LOW I APPRECIATE AND IT SEEMS LIKE SOME PRETTY THOROUGH CONVERSATION WAS THAT THAT OF YOU AS WELL AS ITEMS FRIEDMAN. HAVE BEEN HAVING ON THIS ISSUE ARE AND THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION SOME RICH CHU AND AND OF THE ANSWERS THAT WAS SO LOW. UP MY I THINK OF THAT THAT THE. THE CHAIR APPROPRIATELY HOW THE CONVERSATIONS TO REMOVE THAT ASPECT. AT THAT THE LITIGATION ASPECT FROM THE BILL THAT I THINK WOULD HAVE BEEN TROUBLESOME FOR. MANY OF US. AND. IT LOOKS TO ME THAT. AMENDMENTS AGREED UPON WHICH WILL BEGIN AYE MATCH BEFORE. THE FORGET TO PRIVACY. AND I'M COMFORTABLE IN IN TRUSTING THE WORK OF THE CHAIR AND AND MR LOW ON THAT. YEAH I THINK THAT. HOME. ARE FOCUSED ON THE SAFETY ISSUE ON THE RECALL. AND. THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE MISTER CHAIR IS THE. I'M I'M YOU SPOKE OF THE LARGER ISSUE LESS HE'S DISCONTINUED TO BE WORKED ON. BUT IT'S NOT THE CONTEMPLATION THAT WILL BE DONE THIS INTO THIS BILL BUT THAT IN GENERAL. GIVEN TO INTEREST A MISSILE LOW AND AND FROM YOU AND FROM HIS FRIEDMAN THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE OUTSIDE OF THE PAYMENT OF THIS BILL YES THAT IS VERY GOOD POINT GOOD QUESTION. THAT IS MEANT TO HAPPEN OUTSIDE THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS BILL THIS BILL BECAUSE OF WHERE WE ARE. IS REALLY JUST GOING TO DEAL WITH THE RECALL PROVISIONS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S ON THE TABLE IT'S A MUCH MUCH SIMPLIFIED BILL. I DO APOLOGIZE THAT NOT EVERYBODY HAS SEEN THOSE AMENDMENTS THEY'VE BEEN SORT OF FAST AND FURIOUS AND THANKS TO MY STAFF THE AUTHOR STAFF IS FRIEDMAN STAFF FOR HELPING US TO MAKE SURE WE GOT THIS IN A POSITION. WHERE WE'RE COMFORTABLE? IT DOES FEEL LIKE A WORK IN PROGRESS IT IS WEIRD FACT RELYING ON THE NEXT COMMITTEE TO SOLIDIFY THAT PARTICULAR AMENDMENT BUT THAT BEING SAID I IT IS A VERY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO BE DISCUSSED THAT. AND I'M HOPING I'M ASSUMING THAT WILL SEE A A BROADER BILL OR ANOTHER BILL. FOR A COUPLE BILLS PERHAPS NEXT YEAR. WE HAVE THE SUMMER WE HAVE THE FALL TO TO DRILL DOWN MAKE SURE THAT THAT. WE GET A A A BETTER SENSE OF IT ONE THE FRUSTRATIONS WAS AS WE WERE INVESTIGATING THIS. WE KEPT FINDING OUT ALMOST DAILY NEW INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE PLATFORM WAS BEING USED WHAT THE STATISTICS WERE WHO WERE USING IT WHAT THE TRENDS WERE WAS VERY DIFFERENT THAT. INFORMATION AS IT CAME IN THAT WAS TROUBLING. AND SINCE THAT'S THE CASE I THINK WE DO NEED THE TIME TO. REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE SITUATIONS ARE IF WE'RE GOING TO LEGISLATE AND THEN UNDERSTAND IMPACTS ON RENTAL CARS NOT RENTAL CARS PERSONAL VEHICLES FLEETS. IT THAT'S ALL UP IN THE AIR SO THE BEST ANSWER FOR US. AND THE ENDS. I RESPECT WITH FOR THE AUTHOR. WE COULD HAVE JUST. STOP THIS WHOLE THING TODAY THAT WAS NOT MY DESIRE BECAUSE. MOVING THIS BILL AS IT IS IT IT WILL ACCOMPLISH IMPORTANT. CONSUMER SAFETY OF PROTECTIONS BUT IT ALSO IS AN INDICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE'S WILLINGNESS TO LOOK AT THE BROADER ISSUE AND FIND SOME SOLUTIONS OF FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO ON THE BILL WAS FIRST PASSED. TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES WERE VERY DIFFERENT WE IT'S IT'S NOW DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE WE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THAT YEAH BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THE THIS QUESTIONS WERE GRAPPLING ACROSS MANY PLATFORMS AS WE'VE SEEN THAT THE ORIGINAL. INTENTION OF BILLS NO MORE AS THE CAPABILITIES OF MANY APPLICATIONS AND PLATFORMS CHANGE AS WELL. GET OF I THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS RAISED BY THE GENERAL FUND PRIZE HOLDINGS IS. DOES THE BILL PREJUDICE CONVERSATION I DON'T BELIEVE A DOZEN THINGS BEEN NARROWED ENOUGH TO FOCUS ON THE SAFETY RECALL CONSUMER PROTECTION ASPECT. AND I THINK THE CONVERSATION IS ONE THAT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE IS WILLING TO HAVE. SEPARATE FROM THIS BILL AND IF THAT'S THE CASE AND I'M CERTAINLY CAN'T HOLDING FOR WITH THE BILL AND AND THAT IS THE CASE. THANK YOU. RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS MISS REST. MY BIGGEST CONCERN OF COURSE IS. WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO TO TO LABOR AND THAT I TAKE THEIR CONCERNS VERY SERIOUSLY? I DO SIT ON. PRIVACY SO I WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IT ONCE AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE CHAIR AND. FOOD NOT NOT THE PROMISES BUT THE COMMENTS AND THOUGH ALMOST AS PROMISES. I I DO HAVE HESITATION ABOUT MOVING IT FORWARD BUT. I WILL PROVIDE. I I I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT AGAIN PRIVACY. AND SEE IF THE OBJECTIONS. PACIFIC WE FROM LABOR HAVE BEEN REMOVED IF NOT THEN I WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT BE VOTING IN FAVOR OF IT AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALRIGHT CIGNA MISALIGNMENT CLOSE I JUST VERY QUICKLY THE SPIRIT OF THE CONVERSATION. SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE CHAIR HELPING TO CONVENE ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND. MISS FRIEDMAN MYSELF ABOUT THE CAR COMPANIES CHURRO THAT PROVIDES THE CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WHAT DOES THAT WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE WAS THE ROLE OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. HOW WHAT IS THIS MEAN WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE OTHER KEY ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO WORKERS ABOUT WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED TO A SINCE THE INCEPTION ON ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS ON THE SPECIFICS ON WHAT IS THE FRAMEWORK TOWARDS THE FUTURE? AND THEN SPECIFICALLY WITH THE RESPECTIVE THE LEGISLATION BEFORE US THE LEGISLATION BEFORE US. IN SUMMARY ENCAPSULATES THE MODEL THAT IS ALREADY IN EXISTENCE AND NOSE ART IN LAW BUT A PROVIDES THE FRAMEWORK FOR. CONSUMER PROTECTION WITH RESPECT TO RECALLS. AND IF WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE GOOD SPIRIT AND THE GOOD WILL OF THE CONVERSATIONS COULD CONTINUE.

THAT IT'S TIME TIME IS UP FOR THEM. THIS YEAR IN PARTICULAR WITH ME TO MOVEMENT WITH THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL WE PAID MORE ATTENTION TO STORIES ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSE PRIMARILY SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN. WHICH THEY'RE GOING TO BE FAR TOO MANY EXAMPLES OUT FROM OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YOUNG ATHLETES THAT WERE PART OF USA GYMNASTICS TEAM OVER THE PAST DECADES. TWO THE UNDERAGE USA SWIMMERS WHO ARE SUBJECTED TO ABUSE DESPITE EVIDENCE THAT EXECUTIVES AND OTHER TOP OFFICIALS IN ORGANIZATION NEW OF THE PREDATORY BEHAVIOR. TO THE TEN YEAR PERIOD AT A PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL IN SAN DIEGO IN WHICH COMPLAINTS AGAINST A TEACHER WERE BURIED ALLOWING ADDITIONAL STUDENTS TO BE VICTIMIZED. THESE CASES SHOW HOW PREVALENT CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE SAYS WITH TWENTY PERCENT OF ADULT WOMEN IN FIVE TO TEN PERCENT OF ADULT MEN REMEMBER AN INCIDENT OF SEXUAL ABUSE. THESE CASES SHOW HOW PREVALENT COVER UPS ARE BY ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN A POSITION OF POWER WHO EITHER CHOOSE TO TURN A BLIND EYE OR ARE ACTIVELY PROTECTING THIS PREDATORS. THEY ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT EACH VICTIM'S DECISION OF WHETHER TO COME FORWARD PUBLICLY OR TO PURSUE LEGAL REMEDIES IS DIFFERENT AND HAPPENS AT THEIR OWN TIME. TRAUMA SHAME AND FEAR ARE JUST A FEW OF THE REASONS THAT IT CAN TAKE VICTIMS DECADES BEFORE WANTING TO CONFRONT. OR EVEN KNOWING TO CONFRONT THEIR OWN CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULTS. HOWEVER IT'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS IN THEIR MID TWENTIES STILL HASN'T IT ISN'T READY OR HAVE THEM FIGURED OUT. ON THE RECOURSE WHICH CAN BE STRESSFUL RE TRAUMATIZING THAT WILL TELL THEM THAT THEY CAN ONLY PURSUE CIVIL REMEDIES IF THEY CAN PROVE THAT THEY HAD REPRESS THOSE MEMORIES ARE SOMEHOW DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEIR ABUSE WAS AFFECTING THEM.% AB THIRTY WANT TWENTY WOULD EXPAND ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT BY REMOVING SOME OF THESE TIME LIMITS THAT ARE PLACED UPON VICTIMS INCREASING AMOUNT OF DAMAGES THE VICTIM MAY RECOVER FOR THOSE WHO SOUGHT TO COVER UP.

CERTAINLY NONE OF US HERE RELISH THE. BEING IN A POSITION TO OPPOSE A BILL LIKE THIS AND I DO WANNA COMMENT THAT WITH REGARD TO THIS POLL. OUR COMMENTS GO EXCLUSIVELY TO THE CIVIL STATURE LIMITATIONS FOR BRINGING A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE EMPLOYER OF THE PERPETRATOR WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL IN TERMS OF. OF STATURE LIMITATIONS FOR THE THE PERPETRATOR OF THAT CAN BE OPEN ENDED WEEK WERE NOT. CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. CERTAINLY OUR PROBLEM WITH THE BILL AS IT. TRIES TO MERGE THE POSITION OF THE PERPETRATOR AND THE IMPORT AND THE EMPLOYER IN THEIR VERY DIFFERENT POSITIONS ON EMPLOYER HAS TO HAVE SOME CULPABILITY. AT SOME POINT TO DO IT. BE LIABLE NOT JUST THE FACT THAT THEY EMPLOYED THE PERPETRATOR. THERE ARE LITERALLY. THOUSANDS OF ORGANIZATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WANT TO OR PURCHASE. SEXUAL ABUSE AND MOLESTATION INSURANCE. EVERY CONCEIVABLE PERSON YOU CAN THINK IN THE HEALTHCARE AREA FROM DOCTORS TO COUNSELORS UP PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS AROUND YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS THAT DEAL WITH. KIDS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS EXCEPT FOR A AND I THINK FROM A PUBLIC POLICY STANDPOINT YOU WANT THE CHARTS MECHANISM TO BE OUT THERE. BECAUSE IN ORDER TO GET THIS KIND OF COVERAGE. ORGANIZATIONS HAVE TO GO THROUGH A RIGOROUS APPLICATION PROCESS AND THE APPLICATION PROCESS REQUIRES THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO HAVE A CODE OF CONDUCT IN PLACE. PERFORMED FINGERPRINTING AND BACKGROUND CHECKS TO CONSULT THE NATIONAL ABUSE REGISTRY. HAVE POLICIES OF THE TROLLING ART ALONG WITH ADULTS HAVE MANDATORY REPORTING AND ACTION PLANS FOR REPORTED EVENTS OR CONCERNS REQUIRE ANNUAL TRAINING. ARE TO PREVENT CHILD ABUSE AND HAVE WRITTEN PROCEDURES WITH REGARDING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN EMPLOYEES. CONTRACTORS OF VOLUNTEERS AND MAINTAIN ZERO PAUL OF TOLERANCE. A POLICY TOWARD CHILD ABUSE. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS I MEAN THERE ARE HIGH PROFILE IT'S INCIDENTS AND THERE'S TOO MANY. BUT. YOU GOTTA BELIEVE THAT THESE KINDS OF POLICIES AND ENSURES THAT. NO REALLY EDUCATE AND TEACH ORGANIZATIONS OF THAT THIS IS WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO I THINK HELP PREVENT THESE TYPES OF THINGS REMEMBER CURRENT. AND THAT SHOULD BE THE GOAL. IN OUR VIEW JUST ELIMINATING THE OF THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS. BEFORE LAWSUITS AGAINST EMPLOYERS I'M IS GOING TO MAKE IT MORE THAN LIKELY VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR INSURERS TO OFFER THIS COVERAGE. AT BEST THE PRICES GO UP WHEN THE COVER COVERAGE GIVES RESTRICTED AT WORSE IS GOING TO BE NO COVERAGE AT ALL. AND WE DON'T THINK THAT'S A POSITIVE THING. WE THINK WITH REGARD TO THE EMPLOYER THERE HAS TO BE SOME TIME PERIOD WHEN THERE'S NOT AN UNRESTRICTED RIGHT TO COME AFTER THE EMPLOYER SO THE INSURER HAS SOMEWHERE. TO KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF LAWSUITS ARE TODAY THAT NUMBER IS TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD AND AFTER THAT. THE CLAIMANT HAS. WITHIN THREE YEARS OF THE TIME THEY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THEIR ABUSE SEND. AND THEIR DAMAGES YOU KNOW TO BRING A LAWSUIT WHERE THEY CAN SHOW THE EMPLOYER KNEW SOMETHING FAILED TO TAKE ACTION WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. IS TWENTY SIX THE MAGIC NUMBER APPROPRIATE WHO KNOWS I MEAN DIFFERENT STATES HAVE DIFFERENT NUMBERS IT COULD BE THIRTY IT COULD BE THIRTY FIVE WHATEVER IT IS. BUT AT SOME POINT TO ENSURE CONCERNED CHOOSE WHAT HASN'T HAPPENED HERE THEN THE NEXT STEP IS THAT. NO THEY HAVE TO SHOW THIS SO REDUCES THE CHANCE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SAY WELL WE CAN MOVE RESERVES OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BASE I THINK. IT'S ALL ABOUT BALANCE OF HAVING SOME BALLOTS CERTAINLY YOU WANT THE ABILITY OF CLAIMANTS TO. GO AFTER PEOPLE THAT. THEM FROM THAT CREATED ARAFAT ALLOWED FOR HARM BUT THE SAME TIME YOU WANT THAT COVERAGE TO BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE IT IT DOES SOMETHING VERY POSITIVE IN TERMS OF TEACHING ORGANIZATIONS. WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO TO PREVENT THIS SO WE SHARE THOSE CONCERNS WHAT THE AUTHOR THAN AND STYLE FOR CERTAINLY? MORE THAN WILLING TO CAN CONTINUE WORKING WITH THERE IS THIS BILL MOVES AS WE EXPECTED TO DO BUT FOR RIGHT NOW WE STILL HAVE TO OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S WITH US PLEASE MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS STATE PLAYING BOARD JUST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWER AUTHORITY IS. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES PUBLIC AGENCIES ARE FACED WITH EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE PRIVATE SECTOR INSURANCE COSTS THAT PROVIDED LITTLE COVERAGE AND MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES REFUSE TO OFFER. AND ANY PLANS OR GREATER PRAIRIE WHAT LIKE DIDN'T YOU TO PUBLIC AGENCIES STEP PUBLIC ENTITY RISK PULLING JP IS PRESSED AB WISH AND AS A RESULT MANY PUBLIC ENTITIES INCLUDING MORE THAN A THOUSAND SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. USE THIS MODEL TO EFFECTIVELY SELF INSURE THEIR LIABILITY IN OTHER INSURANCE LOST CONTROL RELATED OBLIGATIONS IN NONPROFIT RISK POOLS. CA.GOV IS A HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND SUPPORTIVE OF THE NEED TO PROTECT THE HEALTH SAFETY AND EDUCATION OF EVERY CHILD AND WE FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF VICTIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT. HOWEVER FROM A PURELY FISCAL PERSPECTIVE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT ELIMINATING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON WHEN A PUBLIC SCHOOL EMPLOYER CAN BE STUDENTS GOING TO RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT. INCREASE CLAIMS AND LEGAL COSTS THAT WILL ADVERSELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S BUDGET AND QUALITY OF EDUCATION FOR ALL CHILDREN. AT A MINIMUM THE BILL WOULD LEAVE PUBLIC AGENCIES WITH AN ABILITY TO ASSESS REST ON ALL CLAIMS AND WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN INCREASED RATES HARD CAPS OR EXCLUSIONS ON LIABILITY COVERAGE THAT PUBLIC ENTITIES CAN OBTAIN. WE WANT TO PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON EDUCATION AWARENESS AND TRAINING TO PRESENT TO PREVENT THESE INSTANCES FROM EVER OCCURRING. BUT WE ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO EDUCATE THE BODY THAT IT IS CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS TO ALTERNATELY BEAR THE COST OF THESE LAWSUITS WHICH HURT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO RELY ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES. BETTER LIMITED AS A RESULT FOR THESE REASONS WHERE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AT THIS TIME BUT REMAIN COMMITTED TO PARTNERING WITH THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF ON HER COMMENDABLE GOAL TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SAYS STEVEN GREEN I'M GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE COUNT CALIFORNIA CAL THE CONFERENCE I'M PINCH HITTING FOR NONETHELESS WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. THE CHURCH DOESN'T DISPUTE THAT VICTIMS DESERVE RESTORATION AND HEALING. AS A RESULT IN. TWO THOUSAND TO S.

SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE SENATOR BURNS BILL THAT REVIVED THE STATUE MEDITATIONS FOR YEAR THE CHURCH DID NOT OPPOSE THAT AT THE TIME. WHO CERTAINLY COMMENTED ON THE FACT THAT THAT IT ONLY APPLIED TO PRIVATE EMPLOYERS AND NOT ANY PUBLIC EMPLOYERS BUT NEVERTHELESS? WORKING WITH INSURERS THE CHURCH STEPPED UP AND FLOOD SETTLED WRITTEN OVER THOUSAND CLAIMS NEARLY A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS TO ADD TO MEET THAT COMMITMENT. AND THEN BEYOND THAT. EACH DIOCESE IN CALIFORNIA HAS PUT IN PLACE SAFE ENVIRONMENT COORDINATORS AND VICTIM ASSISTANCE COORDINATORS TO DEAL WITH VICTIMS WHO HAVE COME FORWARD EVEN SINCE THEN. SO IT IS THE CASE THAT. THAT EACH DIOCESE WILL ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF VICTIMS WORKING WITH THEM TO TRY TO PROVIDE HEALING AND. TO PROVIDE RESTITUTION IN MANY INSTANCES. INSTITUTIONALLY ACROSS NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE OF THE US CONFERENCE OF BISHOPS ADOPTED THE CHARTER FOR THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE. AND. AND THAT PUTS IN PLACE MANY OTHER PROTECTIONS COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF VICTIMS TO COOPERATING WITH. WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ON ON ANY TYPE OF REPORTING TO HAVING FINGERPRINTING BACKGROUND CHECKS. THERE IS AN AUDIT PROCESS BY WHICH THE THE DIOCESES IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE AUDITED EACH YEAR TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE COMPLYING WITH THE CHARTER AND ALL THOSE DIFFERENT PROVISIONS IN THE COMMITMENTS OF THE BISHOPS. SO WHAT IS IT MEAN IN TERMS OF NUMBERS FOR CALIFORNIA WE'RE WE'RE WORKING TO TRY TO GET. MORE COMPLETE NUMBERS BUT. OUR CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT IS IN ABOUT THE LAST DECADE AND A HALF. CHURCH INTO ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE HAVE FINGERPRINT BACKGROUND CHECKED NEARLY HALF A MILLION APPLICANTS VOLUNTEERS CLERGY AND OTHER PEOPLE THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE MINISTRY OF THE CHURCH THE DEAL WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. AND IT IS PROVIDED SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND YOU PROTECTION TRAINING TO BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN AIR IN NUMBERS NICK REACHING NEARLY TWO MILLION. SO SO IT IT CERTAINLY IS A CASE OF WHERE. THE CHURCHES COMMITTED TO PREVENTING THIS GOING FORWARD. BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS WE HAVE ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE BILL AND THE THE RETROACTIVITY GOING BACKWARDS. AS WE INDICATED IN THE IS INDICATED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE PREFERENCE OF THE THE COP HAVE A CONFERENCE WOULD BE THAT THERE BE A RESPONSIBLE THE INCREASE OF THE CURRENT AGE LIMIT. THAT THE THE BILL BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL PRIVATE ARE ALL PUBLIC ENTITIES INCLUDE NOT ONLY LOCAL PUBLIC ENTITIES BUT STATE GOVERNMENT. AND THAT. IT RECOGNIZE RECOGNIZE THE THAT THE COMMITMENT THAT WAS MADE OR REPRESENTATIONS WERE MADE WITH S. B. SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE A DECADE AND A HALF AGO THAT THAT WAS A ONE TIME OPENING OF THE STATUTE. IN AGAIN TO WHICH THE CHURCH HAD RESPONDED AT THAT TIME SO. SO UP THE POSITION A CONFERENCE AT THIS POINT IS OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. AS FOR OUR LETTER HAVING BEEN SENT IN LATE BUT WE ARE ALSO OPPOSE AND LISTEN AND. NANCY LA COSTS AND I'M REPRESENTING THE SCHOOLS ACCESS LIABILITY FUND WHICH PROVIDES ACCESS LIABILITIES OVER HALF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE. AND WE ARE OPPOSED UP PRIMARILY BOB ON THE FOR THE REASONS THAT MISS MARGISON AND MR KNOWING WHAT TALK ABOUT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS NATALIE EVEN WITH THE CHURCH STATE COUNCIL AND WE OPPOSE THIS BILL. ENORMOUS IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL AND I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS FOR COMMENTS IS WITHOUT SET FLETCHER WITH THANK YOU FOR. BRINGING THIS FORWARD THIS THIS IS A TOUGH SITUATION THAT THE FACT THAT THE PREVIOUS LEGISLATURE DID SOMETHING DOES NOT ACTUALLY BY OUR HANDS. NO TIRE HANDS AT ANY POINT RIGHT NOW. AND. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IS TO LISTEN TO. THE TESTIMONY OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND THE TIMELINE SO THEY THEY FACE THEMSELVES UNDER AND. IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCE OF OUR JURISPRUDENCE SYSTEM. THAT WE SEEM TO SAY YES I'M SORRY YOU'VE BEEN SEVERELY HURT INJURED LOST A LIMB YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN RUINED HERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY THAT MAKES IT ALL. BETTER. AND IF THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE THAT WE JUST THEN I THINK IT'S INCOME ON US TEN TO MAKE SURE WE SET UP A SYSTEM. THAT TRULY THAT. THAT REGRETS AND. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF THE EMPLOYERS THE CONCERNS OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE FOSTERED THAT HAD FUELED THAT HAD. LOOK THE OTHER WAY WHEN PEOPLE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BEING ABUSE. AND. THEY MAY END UP BEING THE DEEP POCKETS BUT OUR SYSTEM IS TO SAY YOU'VE BEEN INJURED. HERE'S A BUNCH OF MONEY AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL. PUTTING TO ANY LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY RECOVER SEEK THE HELP THAT'S NECESSARY AND AND MOVE FORWARD WITH SOMEONE'S% LIVES SO FROM MY STANDPOINT. I THINK THIS BILL IS WORTHY OF MOVING FORWARD I CERTAINLY DO HOPE WE MOVE THIS FORWARD TO LIVE CONVERSATIONS I KNOW YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH AND AND TALK WITH SOME BALANCE BUT. FROM THIS COMMITTEE STANDPOINT I THINK YOU'VE SATISFIED WHAT WE WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE CONTINUING TO LOOK OUT FOR THESE VICTIMS ACROSS OUR SYSTEM. OTHER QUESTIONS. COVENS. MISTER HOLDEN. WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER CHOOSE THEIR SECONDS. AND THE SECOND THANK YOU. BUT I LOOK. OKAY MISTER HOLD ITS FIRST AS WEBER. NOTES OKAY IT'S IT'S A QUICK QUESTION I KNOW THAT. OF ONE OF THE WITNESSES TALKED ABOUT THE BURDEN BILL AND HOW. REOPENING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. APPLIED TO PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS BUT YOUR BILL. ALSO INCLUDES PUBLIC AS WELL AS PRIDE. LOOK I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE LEARNED. PROBABLY OVER I DON'T THINK THE LAST YEAR MAYBE THE LAST SIX MONTHS. IS THAT PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN AS BAD IF NOT WORSE ACTORS THAN PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES. REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL ASSAULT AND YES OUR OUR OUR CHILDREN. AND I THINK. TO SHIELD OURSELVES SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS A PUBLIC INSTITUTION IS ALLY BANKRUPT QUITE FRANKLY AND TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW I'M. IN THE SAME WAY THAT A PRIVATE EMPLOYER IF AN EMPLOYER WAS NEGLIGENT AND ALLOWED ABUSE TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN THIS HAPPEN IN A SCHOOL IN SAN DIEGO. I'M SURE IT'S HAPPENED ITS MOTHER SCHOOLS THERE SHOULD STILL BE REQUEST THAT VICTIM IS NO LESS VICTIMIZED. BECAUSE THE. HARASSER OR THE ASSAULT HER ON WHAT SOMEBODY WHO WORK FOR A PUBLIC AGENCY SO I THINK AND GIVEN QUITE FRANKLY THE GOVERNOR'S VETO OF. THE LAST ITERATION OF KIND OF THIS. THIS MOVING AROUND THE STATUE BILL. WHERE WHERE HE EXPRESSED CONCERN? THAT WERE WERE NOT INCLUDING OUR THAT WE WERE. POINTING ONLY TO PRIVATE EMPLOYERS I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE COME TO TERMS WITH MY TO BE EXPENSIVE IT MIGHT BE. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF OUR CHILDREN IF IT COMES TO ACTUALLY PREVENTING THIS IN THE FUTURE IF PUBLIC AGENCIES KNOW THAT FOR EVER. THAT THEY WILL BE. IMMUNE TO TO BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TYPE OF LOOKING THE OTHER WAY AND I'M SORRY IT'S IT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT WHEN PRINCIPALS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS CONTINUE TO DO THAT. WE PROVIDED NO NO REAL INCENTIVE TO STOP THIS ACTION IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT PROTECTING CHILDREN I THINK THAT WE OPEN THIS UP TO EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. IF YOU. THIS WEBER YES I DIDN'T GET THE LETTER FROM THE ACLU SO COULD SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THE OPPOSITION WHAT. WE FEEL YOU MY UNDERSTANDING IS. THAT AND SHE CAN COME SPEAK UP BUT IT WAS THE OPEN ENDED NATURE OF THE STATE OF HAVING NO STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS UP AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT A FEW OF YOU I I HAVE. TALKED TO OUT MORE WILLING TO WORK ON. IT BEING OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME POSSIBLE NOT SHARED WITH A FEW OF THE POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS NEXT COMMITTEE ON TO HAVING NO STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS BUT SHE CAN SPEAK. SO IT WAS INTRODUCED TO THE COULD BE BIRTHPLACE YA I I THINK THAT THAT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE BOTH THE LIMIT COMPLETE ELIMINATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND THEN. ALSO THE ELIMINATION OF SOME OF THE OTHER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN THE LONG NOW WHEN PEOPLE DO BRING THE DELAYED DISCOVERY CASES. IT ASKING THE COURT TO I DO AN INITIAL FINDING OF MERIT AND KEEPING THE PERSON THE DEFENDANT'S NAME. FROM FROM BEING REVEALED UNTIL THERE'S BEEN SOME SHELLING OF CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE WE THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT. DUE PROCESS SAFEGUARDS FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY BE FALSELY ACCUSED. I DO LIKE YOU MACABRE KNOW THE QUESTION WAS FOR THAT YEAH YOU KNOW THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAD I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG. IT COULD BE AND IF THERE ARE FOLKS WHO DON'T REMEMBER AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS MUCH LATER ON I COULD SEE IT BECOMING QUITE A ISSUE. YEAH OKAY THANK YOU. BUT YOU'RE WORKING ON THOSE THREATS ACCOUNT SORRY IS WEBER OKAY ISRAEL. I DO WANT TO GO BACK TO THE BURDEN. BILL THAT. STEP THAT STATUTE LIMITATIONS SOME I KNOW THAT. THERE WERE EMPLOYERS SPECIFICALLY CHURCHES. WHO RESOLVED A NUMBER OF DISPUTES THERE? THE THE SPECIFIC ISSUE OF. COVER UP WITHOUT A DOUBT NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED. I I I HOPE THOUGH THAT THE. WHEN WE DEAL WITH EMPLOYERS AND OF THE THE OPEN ENDED ASPECT OF THIS. THAT THERE WERE SOME CONTINUE DISCUSSION WITH EMPLOYERS SPECIFICALLY THAT THAT IS ONE THING AND THEN I ALSO HAD THE CONCERNED WITH THE ACLU TO TO SEE THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS. WAS SURPRISING TO ME. SO CLEARLY ANOTHER ENTITY THAT. SO THAT. AND IT WASN'T WRITING TO ME TOO BUT I'M WILLING OBVIOUSLY TO WORK ON THEIR CONCERNS IT I'M AYE AYE. I THINK THAT SOMETHING ALONG WITH WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED ABOUT MOVING FORWARD VERY I REITERATE MY. MY COMMITMENT TO VICTIMS TO NOT NEGOTIATE WITH ARE VICTIMIZERS BUT I THINK. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE WE CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH. TO TO PUT. SOME CONSTRAINTS ON THE SPELL TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE. IS TO MAINTAIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. A FEW THINGS OUT FIRST THAT AND THINK THIS IMPORTANT BILL I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING AT MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. JUST A COUPLE THINGS IN IT AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS THAT AT A SEVERAL TIMES. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORKING ON THESE I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT I THINK IT'S BALANCING SOME COMPLICATED ISSUES THESE DUE PROCESS ISSUES. WITH AN OBVIOUS NEED AT THAT THE REALITY IN THESE SITUATIONS IS THAT. THAT THERE ARE VERY REAL MEMORY ISSUES THESE DON'T. IT'S NOT A TYPICAL CASE WHERE YOU HAVE AN ACT. THAT OCCURS. YOU'RE ROBBING A BANK OR SOMETHING THERE'S A PHYSICAL ACT THAT OCCURS AND THEN YOU HAVE A CERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME THE PROSECUTION WANT FIRST HAS CERTAINLY THAT TIME WITHIN WHICH TO BRING THAT SUIT. THIS THIS IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE PEOPLE MAY NOT REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED UNTIL MANY MANY YEARS LATER. IN IT AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT PRECISE YEAR IS IS PROBABLY SPECULATIVE TO SOME EXTENT. BUT IT CERTAINLY IS BEYOND. CHILD THAT IT CERTAINLY BEYOND YOUNG ADULTHOOD. AND SO I I I THINK THAT I. IN JUST TO CONFIRM I THINK YOU'RE GONNA WORK ON THESE TO THE KIND OF THIS DUE PROCESS BALANCE AT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THE ACLU BROUGHT. RE OPENING PASSED CLAIMS YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE. THE. HOW DO YOU BALANCE SORT OF THIS? RESOLUTION THAT A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF THESE HAVE BEEN. RESOLVED AND MOVED ON WITH MEMORY ISSUES CA AYE AYE AYE SOME TO AND I SEE THE NODDING THAT YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. AND ALSO TO SOMETHING THAT. MAYBE COULD COMMENT ON ITS IS AND I THINK AND IT YOU MAY FORTY DOWN THIS THE THAT THAT ISSUE OF STATE LICENSING. YET WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIX THAT WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY SO WHERE WHERE WE'RE GONNA FIX THAT IS AS WELL AS. I AM VERY GOOD THEN I I THINK THIS IMPORTANT THINK IT'S COMPLICATED I'M GLAD YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT. THAT SHOULD MOVE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE SUB SUPPORT IT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU WAS GOING TO HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I AM SORT OF OF THE MINDSET. THAT THE WITNESS EXPRESSED. WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTUAL PERPETRATOR OF THESE HEINOUS ACTS. I I I PERCENT NO PROBLEM WITH COMPLETELY WAVING THE STATS LIMITATION. HOWEVER IT OCCURS TO ME THAT. THE PERPETRATORS OFTEN. DO NOT HAVE ASSETS. SO. I SEE THE NEED FOR POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT OTHER SOURCES. THE EMPLOYER WHERE THE EMPLOYER HAD KNOWLEDGE. OR CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE. I AM CONCERNED THOUGH ABOUT. THE EFFECT OF THIS IF WE COMPLETELY OPEN UP. ALL PAST CLIENTS WITH NO STATUTE FOR EMPLOYERS. OUT WILL THE EFFECT OF THAT ON ENSURE ABILITY. SO I WAS WONDERING IF IT AUTHOR OR OR THE WITNESS COULD EXPOUND ON THAT A LITTLE BIT I MEAN. WHAT IT IS OF PERSON IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE? ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS. IT'S HARD TO QUANTIFY RISK THAT. BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW FAR BACK THE CLAIMS MIGHT GO AND THEN. I'D I DON'T WANNA BE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE TRYING. TO HELP THESE VICTIMS. I WHICH REQUIRES SOME. LIKE BETTER TERM. INTO THE WITH ASSETS TO BE ABLE TO. PAGE JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS I BUT THEN THOSE ENTITIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE PROSPECTIVELY. GETTING INSURANCE THEY NEED. TO TO BE ABLE TO. TO TO FUND THE SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS. SO. A FEW THINGS ON THAT FIRST I WANNA BE CLEAR THAT AN EMPLOYER HAS TO AT LEAST HAVE BEEN NEGLIGENT RIGHT AND WHAT AND ONE OF THE STRUGGLES. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN PAST CLAIMS IS. EVEN CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE AS HARD TO RECREATE RIGHT BUT NEGLIGENCE ADAM. I THINK IS THAT IT'S A AS. A STANDARD THAT. IT'S FAIR IN THIS SITUATION. I HAVE A ARE YOU COMMITTED TO A NUMBER OF YOU AND. AND WORKING WITH THE VICTIMS TO CHIP PROVIDE. MATURITY SO THAT IT WON'T BE OPEN ENDED AND WERE WILLING TO MAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS NEXT COMMITTEE I DON'T WANNA CONFUSE IT TOO MUCH BECAUSE THE BILL WAS ANALYZED WITH NOTHING BUT. I WILL TELL YOU. I'M ASKING TODAY FOR A VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THESE VICTIMS. WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT WE ARE GOING TO. PROVIDE CERTAINTY AS FAR AS. HOW? HOW LONG PEOPLE HAVE TO LOOK BACK AND AND HOWL ALUM AT WHAT POINT ARE THEY BARRED FROM STATURE MEDITATIONS BOTH OF THOSE WILL BE ADDRESSED? AT BUT I THINK IT'S STILL IMPORTANT TO. TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR THESE VICTIMS AND ENSURING THAT. THAT. THE OPPONENTS KNOW THAT THEIR SUPPORT FOR THESE VICTIMS IN THIS IDEA SO AM I I CAN JUST TELL YOU THAT AYE WELL I'M WORKING ON THOSE A LOT OF YOU HAVE SEEN ON MY. POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS WHICH I I CAN STATE BUT I DON'T WANT TO CONFUSE THE SITUATION SINCE WE'RE NOT HEARING THOSE AMENDMENTS TODAY I I'D BE TAKING THEM ON MY OWN COMMITTEE. AND THAT'S TO ADAM OPEN UP THE LOOK BACK PERIOD FOR THREE YEARS. SO THE BERT BELL HAD A YEAR. WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MISSED OUT ON THAT FOR VARIETY OF REASONS AND. IF THAT'S WHAT AT GET REOPEN IT FOR THREE YEARS. ON THE LOOK BACK PERIOD AND WOULD PROVIDE OUT WHAT EXTEND WHAT IT IS NOW EIGHT TWENTY SIX THE YET TO BE TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD THAT WOULD EXTEND AT FORTY WHICH SEEMS REASONABLE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE. IN. CRIMINAL LAW. SO INSTEAD OF TWENTY SIX AND THOSE OF US WHO AROUND THAT KIND OF TWENTY YEAR OLDS I KNOW THAT. COMING TO TERMS WITH TRAUMA IN YOUR EARLY CHILDHOOD IN YOUR MID TWENTIES DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOUR. NECESSARILY AT THAT POINT FORTY I THINK EXTENDS AT. TO A POINT WHERE PEOPLE HAVE GROWN UP. AND EXTENDS THE THE PERIOD BY WHICH ONCE DISCOVERED. IF IT'S AFTER FORTY EIGHT FROM THREE YEARS TO FIVE BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THREE YEARS WAS VERY. LIMIT TINA WE TALKED A NUMBER OF VICTIMS WHO IF YOU REALLY THINK THRILLED. THE WHAT THE PSYCHIATRISTS AND REALIZING WHAT HAPPENED THE DAMAGE THAT IT'S DONE AND MAYBE YOUR. YOUR MARRIAGE IS FALLING APART OVER AT OUR. THINGS ARE GOING ASTRAY WITH YOUR KIDS OR WHATEVER IS HAPPENING YOU STILL HAVE TO COME TO TERMS WITH TELLING YOUR FAMILY. IN THAT INSTANCE OF THE CHURCH TELLING YOUR COMMUNITY YOUR CHURCH WHAT HAPPENED MAKING THE DECISION TO FILE A LAWSUIT AND I'M THREE YEARS ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS LIKE A LONG PERIOD TIME IT IS NOT AYE I THINK IS. PROBABLY NOT THAT LONG FOR VICTIM WHO'S DEALING WITH ALL OF. EVERYTHING FROM EMOTIONAL TO TO. FAMILY SITUATIONS TO COMMUNITY SITUATIONS TO UNDERSTANDING THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS THEIR LEGAL I'M POSSIBILITIES SO THAT WOULD. TURN THIS BILL NO LONGER INTO AN OPEN ENDED. NO STATUE OF LIMITATIONS BUT OF COURSE IT HASN'T BEEN. ANALYZED AND I DON'T WANT TO YOU KNOW WE TALK THAT TALK TO THE CHAIRMAN OF TALK TO A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I WON AT LEAST GIVE YOU OUT OF THOSE COMMITMENTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND HOPE THAT YOU CAN SUPPORT IT KNOWING THAT I'M I'M GOING TO BE DOING THAT. COULD I ASK THE MINISTER OR WOULD TO RESPOND ON THE INSURER GUILTY. ON THE RETRO ACTIVE IF YOU I'M JUST WHAT KIND OF THING. CLAIM IT'S TODAY UNDER THE CURRENT STATUTE LIMITATIONS RIGHT NOW. ARE STILL ELIGIBLE TO BRING ACTIONS AGAINST THE EMPLOYER. ON ABUSIVE OCCURRED IN THE EIGHTIES. THE NINETIES. NOW THE RETROACTIVITY. HERE NOW GOES BACK TO CASES UNDER FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY YEARS OLD. THAT'S PROBLEMATIC INSURANCE STANDPOINT BECAUSE FRANKLY YOU'RE JUST CHANGING THE CONTRACT. HELP THE CONTRACT EXPIRED NOW DO YOU HAVE A THE LEGISLATURE'S OPEN THAT CONTRACT AND SPECIALLY IN THE SITUATION WE'RE NOW. IN A NUMBER OF CASES FOR PRIVATE ENTITIES THIS WOULD BE THE THIRD TIME AND SO COMPANIES THAT COVERED THE ORIGINAL STATUTE BABY COVERED WERE INVOLVED IN. CASES. DURING THE BURDEN BILL WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT NOW TO LOOK AT OTHERS AND THAT'S PRIVATE EMPLOYERS IT DOESN'T TO HOME. IT'S BONTA PUBLIX YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THERE. THE DEPTH OF THAT DIFFICULT OF THE FINAL COMMENT I JUST WONDER. GIVEN THE COMMENTS OF THE AUTHOR AND THE QUESTION MISTER HOLDEN WITH REGARD. TO GO BACK AND I JUST WANT YOU ANSWER CLERK THAT WAS PRESENT THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR SOME INEXPLICABLE REASON THAT THE MEAN CHAIR OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE IS CALLED THE SENATE COMMITTEE. SO THE MOTION THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. SOME OF. OKAY I WE DO HAVE WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND IT'S GOING TO CLARIFY THAT IT WILL BE GOING TO. APPROPRIATIONS WHO KNOWS WHAT'LL HAPPEN TO IT THERE HELL. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IS GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU MAKE. I JUST WANNA THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT I'VE HAD ON THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. I THINK ALL OF US UNDERSTAND. AND WHEN YOU TALK TO VICTIMS IT'S. SIMPLY HEARTBREAKING. FOR FOR PEOPLE OF VICTIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT WHO THESE ARE PEOPLE IT IT'S NOT JUST THE. KIDS WERE SALTED AND VIOLATED. BUT MOST OF THE TIME BY SOMEBODY THAT THEY TRUSTED AND SOMEBODY THAT TOLD US TO TRUST THEM. WITH OUR KIDS. AND THIS IDEA THAT WITH ALL THAT TRAUMA IN EVERYTHING THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHEN WHEN THAT COMES OUT WHENEVER THAT COMES OUT. AND AND TO REALIZE THAT. THAT WE SAID IN THIS ROOM AND. NEGOTIATE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO VICTIMIZE THEM. ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE READY WITHIN A YEAR TO FILE SOMETHING. I'M. IT'S HEARTBREAKING IT'S A LITTLE SICKENING TO BE HONEST AND SO I I JUST HOPE. AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE I HOPE WE CAN STAND WITH VICTIMS. IN A WAY. THAT TRULY COURAGE I HEARD A LOT ABOUT WHAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE GOOD ACTORS IN EDUCATION AND WE FINGERPRINT AND AND AND TRAIN PEOPLE I GUARANTEE YOU IF YOU HOLD PEOPLE LIABLE THAT THOSE. INSTITUTIONS ARE COMING MUCH MORE LIKE MORE MUCH MORE. DETECTIVE OF OUR CHILDREN IF WE SHOW THAT THERE'S A CONSEQUENCE. TO NOT PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN. THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT THE NEXT GENERATION OF. I PLEAD NOT. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RETIREMENT. THANK YOU. KALRA PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CHAO. CHU BY TO AYE WEBER AYE WEBER AYE HOLDEN. HOLDEN I KALRA.

OF A PRIVATIZED AND SILENCING LEGAL SYSTEM. ARBITRATION SHOULD NEVER BE A FORCED REQUIREMENT OF YOUR EMPLOYMENT YET MY STORY IS ONE OF COUNTLESS OTHERS. IN MARCH OF TWENTY FIFTEEN I WAS HIRED BY WE WORK WHICH ISN'T OFFICE LEASING START UP THAT'S VALUED AT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. WELL MY TITLE IS VAGUE MY SALARY LOW I WAS EXCITED TO BE PART OF A GROWING COMPANY. BUT AT THE TIME I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THE RAPID GROWTH WAS DUE TO AN EXPLOITED AND OVERWORKED LABOR FORCE. I NOTICE MYSELF OF MY YOUNG CO WORKERS WORKING AN EXTRA TEN TO THIRTY HOURS A WEEK. DOING MENIAL LABOR TASKS LIKE CHANGING TAGS. AND RETRIEVING MAIL. EARLY ON I REPORTED ISSUES OF WORK RELATED STRESS AND UNDER STAFFING BUT I WAS MET WITH THE COMMENT SILICON VALLEY ANSWER. WHERE STARTUP WHERE FIGURING THE THINGS OUT? I WAS BARELY LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK AND BEGAN TO BUILD A CASE FOR OUR MISS CLASSIFICATION AS SALARY EXEMPT WORKERS. I HOPE THAT WE WOULD HAVE HAD A COLLECTIVE CHANCE TO FIGHT FOR FAIR WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS. WHEN MY MANAGER FOUND OUT SHE TOLD ME TO STOP TALKING OTHER EMPLOYEES ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS BECAUSE THEIR PATH IS THEIR PATH THAT I SHOULD LET THEM DISCOVER ON THEIR OWN. SHE SAID MY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WAGES WERE NEGATIVE TO THE WORKPLACE AND ASKED IF I WANTED TO RESIGN. A FEW WEEKS LATER MANAGERS FROM HR LEGAL SURPRISE EACH OFFICE REQUIRING ALL EMPLOYEES TO SIGN NEW CONTRACTS. A CONFERENCE ROOM WAS SET UP WITH MANAGERS A STACK OF PAPERS ONE EMPTY CHAIR AND A PAN. WHEN I WAS CALLED INTO THE ROOM OVER FIFTY PAGES WERE PLACED IN FRONT OF ME INCLUDING A NINE PAGE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH THEY TITLED.

MY NAME IS CLIFF PALEVSKY APPEARING ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS IN THE CALIFORNIA PLAN ATTORNEYS. A I WANT TO OF. SPEAK TO THE LEGAL. PROPOSITION AND THE NATURE OF THIS BILL WHICH I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY MISS CHARACTERIZE FIRST OF ALL IT DOES NOT APPLY. TO ALL CLAIMS. AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT IT WOULD NOT APPLY TO FRAUD CLAIMS OR CONTRACT CLAIMS OR TORT CLAIMS. OR WRONGFUL TERMINATION CLAIMS OR JUST BECAUSE CLAIMS WERE TALKING ABOUT IT APPLY TO. PUBLIC LAW CLAIMS YOUR LAWS THE LAWS THAT YOU PASS. BUT THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENFORCE. THE ONE PHRASE AT THE U. S. SUPREME COURT REPEATS OVER AND OVER HIS ARBITRATION IS A MATTER OF CONSENT. AND NOT COERCION. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT I'VE ARGUED SEVEN CASES ARBITRATION CASE TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME. BASED TO SAY ARBITRATE THE BEDROCK JUSTIFICATION FOR ARBITRATIONS VOLUNTARINESS. THE REASON THAT THIS BILL THIS NARROW BILL IS NOT PREEMPTED. IT IS IT IS VERY SIMPLE IT DOES NOT INVALIDATE. FLORA VOID ANY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT PERIOD. IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT ARBITRATION OF ANY KIND OF CASE. IT PERMITS PRE DISPUTE AGREEMENTS IT PERMITS POSTED SPEWED AGREEMENTS. A THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN. TO MY KNOWLEDGE. IN ARBITRATION DECISION FROM THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. THAT APPLIED IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE WAS NO ARBITRATION AGREEMENT EVERY SINGLE PREEMPTION CASE. COMES UP IN THE CONTEXT OF SOMEONE SIGNED THAT AGREEMENT AND THE COURTS SAYING SHOULD BE HALTED TO IT. SO THERE IS NO PREEMPTION ISSUE HERE BECAUSE OUR FOCUS IS TO JUST SIMPLY INSURE THAT THE CREATION OF THE CONTRACT HAS SOME MINIMAL. LEVEL OF VOLUNTARINESS WERE CONSENT. THE. ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR IS THAT UNLIKE IN THE CONSUMER CONTEXT. THE FAA DOES NOT. PREEMPT OR EVEN APPLY TO ALL WORKERS THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN THE CASE THAT WE WERE UPON A IN IN IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND. EXAMS TENS OF THOUSANDS OR PERHAPS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS IN THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY IN THE MARITIME INDUSTRY WORKING ON RAILROADS SO CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY STRONG INTEREST IN SETTING ITS OWN LAWS AND ITS OWN POLICIES. IN AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO DO THAT. IN NY ANALYSIS AT YOUR STAFF DO VERY GOOD ANALYSIS YOUR STAFF PROVIDED THEY TALKED ABOUT THE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE LABOR COMMISSION. WHICH IS AN EXTRAORDINARY. CONSTITUTIONALLY ESTABLISHED ADMINISTRATOR FOR AND TO HELP WORKERS TO GO LIMIT EIGHT CLAIMS TO RESOLVE CLAIMS. RIGHT NOW IF YOU EMPLOYER REQUIRES YOU TO SIGN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT YOU CAN'T GO TO THE LABOR COMMISSION. THEY CAN'T ADJUDICATE YOUR CLAIM ANYMORE. AND THE DOORS OF THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING COMMISSION. CAN BE SHOT BY THE EMPLOYER THEN YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND YOU'VE SET UP THESE EXTRAORDINARY LAWS AND PROCESS SEIZE. ACROSS THE REGULATION WAS NECESSARY AND EUROPE. WE CAN'T ALLOW. THE PARTY BEING REGULATED TO SAY YOU CAN'T ENTER INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP. WITHOUT WAIVING THOSE RIGHTS. JUST SO THAT YOU KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE THIS CAN BE. THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY HAS EVER SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE HAS NOT REQUIRED ARBITRATION OF STATUTORY DISCRIMINATION CAN. IT MADE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE IN THE CLIMATE IN THE SEX HARASSMENT CLIMATE IN THE DISCRIMINATION CLIMATE. PRESIDENT OBAMA. SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER PROHIBITING GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FROM ANY EMPLOYER WHO REQUIRE ARBITRATION OF DISCRIMINATION OR SEX HARASSMENT SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES. THIS IS A MAINSTREAM ISSUE. WHETHER YOU SAY ME TOO IS HERE OR ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WE HAVE FOR TOO LONG. ENABLED. SEX HARASSMENT SENT VICTIMS OF HARASSMENT TO SECRET TRIBUNALS WITH NO RIGHT OF APPEAL. THE PUBLIC NEEDS THIS TO STOP AND MRS. FAR AS I THINK THE STATE CAN GOING ACHIEVING THAT GOAL.

B. THIRTY EIGHTY. I WANT TO CLEAR UP A FEW POINTS THAT I BELIEVE UMBER STATED IN THE PROPONENTS. AT STATEMENTS AND ARGUMENTS ONE. BIT ARBITRATION DOES NOT ELIMINATE YOUR SUBSTANCE RATES IN IF IT'S UNLAWFUL IN A COURT IT'S UNLAWFUL ARBITRATION THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS ALREADY STATED. THAT AN ARBITRATION CAN AGREEMENT CANNOT WAIT OR SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS OTHERWISE IT'S UNENFORCEABLE WHAT IT DOES DO IS CHANGES THE FOREMAN WHICH RESULT THOSE DISPUTES. SO WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT I'M ADDITIONAL IN CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT A SECRET FORUM SO SENATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORPORATE OR SENATOR CORPORATE ACCOUNT NUMBER WHICH HOUSE SHE WAS IN AT THE TIME. UP PASS LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRED THAT ALL ARBITRATION COMPANIES A REPORT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS A SPREADSHEET AND A DATABASE THAT HAS EVERY ARBITRATION THAT THE CONDUCT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S SEARCHABLE IT HAS THE PARTY'S NAMES THE ALLEGATIONS THAT TOURNEY'S INVOLVED HOW MANY TIMES THEY'VE BEEN BEFORE THAT ARBITRATOR. THE DAMAGES THAT ARE IS OUR OF WORDED AND HOW THE RESULT THAT'S MORE DATED THAN YOU'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF A COURT OF LAW BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT FROM ALL OF THAT. I COUNTY CLERKS IN OUR STATE AND IT DOESN'T WORK ARE DOES IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW. ON THE OTHER POINT I WANT TO GET YOU AND I KNOW. THAT THE PROPONENTS OF AT LEAST SUGGESTED THIS IN LAST COMMITTEE WILL OF ARBITRATION IS SO GREAT AND IT'S SO AMAZING FOR THE EMPLOYEES AND THE EMPLOYER THAN THIS BILL WILL PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. THAT EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES WILL JUST RENT ARBITRATION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOTS A CONDITION OF A CONTRACTOR NOT BUT ECHOES THE VERY HEART OF WHY EMPLOYERS UTILIZE ARBITRATION. EMPLOYERS UTILIZE ARBITRATION NOT BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA GET SOME ADVANTAGE AGAINST THE EMPLOYEES IN ARBITRATION THAT THAT THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO REDUCE THE AWARDS TO THE EMPLOYEES IN ARBITRATION THEY'D UTILIZE ARBITRATION. AS UNIFORM WAY IN WHICH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES TO AVOID LITIGATION COSTS AND ATTORNEYS FEES THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE THE ROSE DISPUTE RESOLVED WITHIN A YEAR THING GOING LITIGATED FOR FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS IN THE CIVIL COURTS AND HAVE TO PAY NOT ONLY THEIR DEFENSE COSTS AND THEIR ATTORNEYS FEES. BUT THE ATTORNEYS FEES AT THAT POINT AS WELL AND SO WHEN YOU LACK THAT UNIFORMITY THAN YOU OUT YOU CAN'T MITIGATE THAT RISK WITH REGARDS TO ATTORNEYS FEES. AS LONG AS WE HAVE THE UNDERLYING ISSUE WITH REGARD TO LITIGATION ENVIRONMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE EMPLOYERS CAN BE SUED FOR TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS ON THE PAYSTUB THAT THE RESULTING IN THE WAGE FLOPS. YOU WILL SEE COMPANIES UTILIZE ARBITRATION AS A WAY TO AVOID THE ATTORNEY'S FEES THAT CAN BASICALLY BANKRUPT THEM AND PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS SO THAT IS WHY WE UTILIZE THE ARBITRATION AS A CONDITION OF CONTRACT. THE OTHER POINT I WANTED TO MAKE WAS WITH REGARDS THE PREEMPTION ISSUE. AYE THERE'S SEVERAL CASES SOME KIND OF SURPRISING THE PROPONENTS COMMENTS THAT SAY THAT THE MANDATORY USE OF ARBITRATION HAS NEVER BEEN ADDRESSED THE ARE MADERA SKATES WITH AN ADHESION CONTRACT THAT REQUIRED EMPLOYEES TO UTILIZE IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT. UNCONSCIONABLE WOULD BE UP IN A HUGE AND CON IN THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT THE SONIC CALABASAS CASE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECISION WHICH THREE PART A WAIVER OF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER HEARING WAS ALSO IN A HUGE IN CONTRACT IN THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT. ON THE ISSUE BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT LAST YEAR AND THE CANDOR NURSING CASES I WAS DEALING WITH REGARDS TO THE CONTRACTUAL FORMATION AND THE WHOLE IDEA THAT IF WE. THAT FEDERAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SOMEHOW IGNORED THE ISSUE OF CONTRACTUAL FORMATION. THAT YOU'VE BASICALLY BEEN UNDERMINING THE WHOLE POINT OF ARBITRATION ACT IF THEY WERE CONCERNED WITH PUBLIC A CONTRACT IS FORM SO I DISAGREE WITH THE FACT. THAT THE ARBITRATION OF FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT DOESN'T ADDRESS MENTAL THE CONTRACT IS FORMED IN WITH REGARDS THE ANALYSIS ON. THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW UNDER THE SAVINGS CLAUSE OF THE CONTRACT A OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT IT'S NOT IT'S ONLY APPLICABLE TO ONE PROVISION IN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT AND THAT'S ARBITRATION. EMPLOYERS TO REQUIRE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACT OUGHT TO BE MADE AS A CONDITION OF THE CONTRACT EMPLOYEE BENEFITS WAGES LEAVES ON VACATION EXCEPT TRACK ALL OF THOSE CAN BE MADE AS A CONDITION OF THE CONTRACT YOU JUST CAN'T HAVE ARBITRATION AS COULD. THE CONTRACT THAT IS WHAT THE ESSENCE OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT STATES IS THAT YOU CANNOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ARBITRATION WHEN YOU'RE FORMING A CONTRACT. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND I I AGAIN APPRECIATE THAT THAT PROPONENTS OF SUGGESTED THAT THEY FIX THE FEDERAL ISSUES BUT JUST TWO WEEKS AGO. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WEBBER'S BILL ON TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN THAT WAS PASSED PROXIMALLY THREE YEARS AGO VERY SIMILAR LANGUAGE THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT AS A CONDITION OF A CONSUMER CONTRACT WITH THE RIGHTS AND OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL. JUST SAID WAS PREEMPTED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND SO AGAIN VERY SIMILAR LANGUAGE AS AN A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY IT'S BEEN REPEATEDLY STRUCK DOWN AS I PRINTED THEM THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITH MISTER CHAIRMAN PRACHANDA ABOUT THE STILL CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THE TIME TO TODAY. OF THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN IS BROUGHT FORWARD A IMPORTANT ISSUE AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM THAT WE'RE ALL AWARE OF. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS ATTENTION FOCUSED ON SOLUTIONS. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERY PROPOSED SOLUTION IS THE BEST WAY UP FOR CALIFORNIA TO MOVE FORWARD. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT AS WRITTEN. THAT AB THIRTY EIGHTY CREATES AN UNTENABLE DYNAMIC. THAT UNDERCUTS THE ABILITY TO SETTLE CASES AND IN SOME CASES MAY PROHIBIT THAT ABILITY. ARM AND IT PROHIBITS A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS EVEN WHEN BOTH PARTIES THAT DESIRE THEM BEFORE I GET INTO THE DETAILS ON THAT. I DO WANT TO DETANGLE JUST A BIT. THE ARBITRATION VERSES CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUE. THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES OUR* A CONFIDENTIALITY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS A SPECIFIC TO ARBITRATION. A CONCERN AS THE FORMER. WITNESS TESTIFIED ARBITRATION ACTUALLY IS MORE THE TRANSPARENT ON YOU CAN HAVE A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS IN BOTH LITIGATION AND ARBITRATION AND SO. ARBITRATION THE OUR ARBITRATION ISSUE SHOULD STAND ON ITS OWN FROM THE CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUE. ON THE VAST MAJORITY OF. FILED CIVIL LITIGATION SETTLED BY VOLUNTARY AND WILLING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES. UP CALIFORNIA HAS LONG HAD A SMART AND IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY GOAL OF ENCOURAGING. SETTLEMENT AN AMICABLE RESOLUTION. THAT BENEFITS BOTH PARTIES AND SAVES PRECIOUS PUBLIC RESOURCES AND IF YOU LOOK AT SECTION FOR ARE CONCERNED IT WAS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS IT WAS NOT GRANTED. MUCH CREDENCE ON BUT EVEN IN THE ANALYSIS THEY INDICATED THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT AMENDING US WE ARE CONCERNED THAT SAYING THAT ANY RECEIPT OF ANY EMPLOYMENT RELATED BENEFIT. THAT TERM RELATED IS EXTREMELY BROAD AND LOSE ANYTHING RELATED TO YOUR EMPLOYMENT. A VERY ARGUABLY EVEN LITIGATION ON THAT INTEREST YOUR BENEFIT. CAN BE PROHIBITED THEIR. ON THE OTHER APPROACH EFFECTIVE THOUGH PERHAPS UNINTENTIONAL. PROHIBITION ON ALL NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS IS A REAL PROBLEM AS WELL CALIFORNIA FOR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING CLAIMS ARE SOME OF THE MOST SENSITIVE ISSUES THAT ARE LITIGATED TODAY. AND ELIMINATE AN NDA IS WILL NOT PROTECT CLAIMANTS ON IF YOU LOOK AT SECTION FOUR THREE TWO FOUR FOUR THREE TWO POINT FOR. THE CONCERN IS IS THAT THEY SAY AS A CONDITION OF ENTERING INTO A CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT NOT AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT ANY CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON A. B. THIRTY EIGHTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OF RING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. IT'S CUNNINGHAM PERCENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS. IT SOUNDS LIKE ON THE FEDERAL PREEMPTION ISSUE THAT THERE'S JUST A DISPUTE. I AND I DID. I'M TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THAT AND. WHAT? WHY AGAIN WOULD THIS NOT BE PREEMPTED BY THE FAA SO I I CAN DEFERRED TO THE EXPERT BUT AT THIS AYE I JUST WANT? TO BE CLEAR WE WE FEEL LIKE GIVEN. PASS LAWS AND WHAT'S HAPPENED THAT WEEK NARROWLY TAILORED THIS IN A WAY THAT WE'RE NOT INVALIDATING AN ACTUAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT I THINK IN ALL OF THOSE CASES AND ACTUALLY. THE EXPERT ARGUED MANY OF THOSE CASES SO I LET HIM. CLARIFY BUT IN THOSE CASES AS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED AND IT WAS TRYING TO BE INVALIDATED THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM SUGGESTING THAT THERE CAN BE NO. NOT JUST ARBITRATION AGREEMENT BUT ANY WAIVER OF A PROTECTED RIGHTS. THAT THE SPECIFIC ANSWER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT SAYS. AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE ENFORCED SO IT REQUIRES THERE'D BE AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS PREEMPTED IN IN. OUR ASSEMBLY WOMAN'S WEBBER'S GOOD BILL WAS IT ATTEMPTED TO AVOID AN AGREEMENT THAT WAS SIGNED. WE DON'T HAVE THAT ARE BUILT WE SPECIFICALLY DID NOT TRY TO NEGATE OR AVOID ANY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IT SIGNED WHICH IS REALLY WHERE THE FAA APPLIES. ALSO. THE FAA. HAS TO HAVE SOME DEGREE OF CONSENT ACCORDING TO THE SUPREME COURT WERE TALKING ABOUT THE WAIVER OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO PETITION FIFTY MEMORIZED TO PROCESS A SEVENTH AMENDMENT RIGHT OF. THE JURY TRIAL SO THERE HAS TO BE SOME DEGREE OF CONSENT. A AND AND THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT ARBITRATION THIS IS NOT AN ANTI ARBITRATION BILL. A AND GOING FURTHER. THE FAA DOESN'T APPLY TO ALL EMPLOYMENT. THERE'S THERE'S AT NUMBERS OF CATEGORIES OF WORKERS WHO ARE EVEN COVERED BY THE FAA THERE WAS JUST A CASE TWO MONTHS AGO. I INVOLVING A CLASS ACTION PROHIBITION WHERE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT UPHELD CLASS PROHIBITIONS FOR AWHILE BUT WE WERE IN. THE PLAINTIFFS WERE ALLOWED TO GO FORWARD BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS. SO THE FAA ONLY HAS LIMITED APPLICATION IN THE WORKPLACE BUT IT HAS NEVER BEEN APPLIED. IN A CASE WHERE THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT. I THAT THE OPPONENTS HERE MENTIONED THE ARMAND DAR'S CASE I ARGUED THAT. THE SONIC CALABASAS CASES I ARGUED THAT TWICE TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT BOTH OF THOSE CASES HAD SIGNED ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS AND THE QUESTION WAS. ARE WE GOING TO ENFORCE IT. SO THERE IS NO CASE WHERE THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT REACHES DOWN TO A STATE AND SAID YOU CAN'T REGULATE THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP. YOU CAN'T REGULATE. THE APPLICATION PROCESS IT'S SIMPLY IS NEVER HAPPENED. THIS STATEMENT THAT ARBITRATION IS NOT SECRET IS SIMPLY FALSE I WAS ALSO VERY INVOLVING THAT'S GOING BEYOND. OKAY WAS AS PART OF YOUR QUESTION NO I THINK YOU COVERED THAT THANK YOU YEAH. THANK YOU'RE CLEARLY AN EXPERT ON. ABOUT. I JUST SAID TWO OTHER QUICK QUESTIONS. I AM I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED I GUESS ON. ON THE EFFECT THIS MIGHT HAVE ON ON. FOLKS THAT. COULD NOT NECESSARILY AFFORD AN ATTORNEY GIVEN THAT LITIGATION IN COURT. BY AND LARGE TENDS TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE FLANK HERE. AND THAT SORT OF THING THEN ARBITRATION. AND I'M WONDERING IF ANY THOUGHT HAS BEEN GIVEN. THE EFFECT OF THAT AND ON THAT ON. PLAINTIFFS ON PEOPLE THAT. YOU DON'T WANT OR NEED COUNSEL AND MIGHT BE ABLE TO HANDLE OUR PETITION THEMSELVES OR MIGHT BE OPEN MINDED ERNIE. THAT WOULD BE MORE WILLING TO TAKE THAT CASE BECAUSE IT'S A. LESS SUBSTANTIAL TIME COMMITMENT GREAT QUESTION. THE LABOR CITING THE LABOR COMMISSION WAS SET UP TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE INITIALLY AND AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT PROHIBITS ACCESS ESSENTIALLY THE LABOR COMMISSION. ALL I DO WHEN I'M NOT SITTING HERE IS REPRESENT PLAINTIFFS AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE MAKES IT LESS LIKELY. THAT OF A LAWYER WILL TAKE A CASE SO IN FACT IT IS AN IMPEDIMENT TO GETTING ACCESS TO JUSTICE. AND AND IN FACT THOSE PEOPLE WHO GO FORWARD ARBITRATION WITHOUT A LAWYER ARE GETTING RUN OVER BY MOTIONS TO DISMISS BY SOME REDUCTION MOTIONS. BELIEVE ME ARBITRATION IS BEING USED AS A FORM OF CLAIMS SUPPRESSION IT IS NOT BEING USED TO CREATE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. THE LABOR COMMISSION AND THE FE H. AND THE PUBLIC COURT SYSTEM. CREATES ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND NOT ONLY ARE WE CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD ACCESS TO DO OUR GOAL HAS TO BE TWO DETERRENT BAD CONDUCT OF THAT PEOPLE DON'T NEED TO GO TO COURT OR NEED TO GET LAWYERS. AND THE DETERRENT EFFECT IS GONE. WHEN WHEN PERPETRATORS THINK THEY CAN HIDE BEHIND SECRET TRIBUNALS AND AND AND FORUMS THAT ARE TILTED IN THEIR FAVOR AN ARBITRATOR SHOULD KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO SATISFY THE REPEAT PLAYER. YOUR LAWS ARE NOT BEING SERVED OF THE INTEGRITY OF YOUR LAWS IS BEING UNDERMINED IF IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND ANYONE. WHO WANTS? TO TAKE A CASE TO MEDIATION OR ARBITRATION OR CONCILIATION. CAN DO THAT. SO. DO YOU DISPUTE THEN I MEAN I. I MEAN I I'VE HAD CASES WHERE ARE WE CAN GET OUR ARBITRATION DATE. YOU'RE YOU YEARS QUICKER THAN WE CAN GET A JURY TRIAL DAY IN COURT AND GET SOME CONCERNED A LITTLE BIT GIVEN. AND THE WHOLE MAXIM JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED. OF WHAT. WE'VE GOT OVER BURDENS ME COURTS ALREADY WE'VE GOT IMPACTED COURTS IN EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE. WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THIS GOING TO BE ON? ON THAT KNOW THROUGH IT. IT AT THE PLAINTIFF CAN VOLUNTARILY AGREED AND EARNED ARBITRATION THAT DOESN'T PREVENT VOLUNTARY ARBITRATION WHEN THERE IS A CLAIM. SO I THINK THESE ARGUMENTS. ALTHOUGH CAN BE VALID AT DIFFERENT TIMES ARE. ARE. TAKING CARE OF IN THIS BILL IN THAT THEY CAN ENTER AND ARBITRATION IT JUST ALLOWS THEM TO ALSO IF THEY CHOOSE TO. FILE A LAWSUIT ORBITAL LABOR COMMISSIONER. IT GIVES THE THE VICTIM A FEW WELL I'M THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE BANJA. THERE IS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS I THINK THAT FOR SO MANY FOR TRACTION CLAUSES AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT AS A CONDITION OF LODGING AS A CONDITION OF MEDICAL TREATMENT. AND RIGHTS ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE YOU YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. I THINK WITH THE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE THIS IS A RIGHTEOUS THE BILL AGREE. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION MAKING SURE THAT. IF YOU WANT TO ENTER IF YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH ARBITRATION YOU STILL CAN. THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT IT IN THE WAY THAT I HAVE READ IT. ANYBODY ANYBODY CAN STILL. GO TO ARBITRATION REQUEST ARBITRATION ARE ASKED THE JUDGE TO ORDER THEM TO ARBITRATION THAT'S STILL A POSSIBILITY SO I I DO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS. THIS. BILL FORWARD. THANK YOU MS WEBER. YES I TO WHAT IT OF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR IT I KNOW IT'S OF THESE ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IN THE BILLS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET OUT AND GET THE GOVERNOR TO SIGN THEM. AND SIGH I HOPE ALL GOES WELL WITH YOU WE HAD QUITE A BATTLE WITH THE ONE THAT IDEA. YOU KNOW IT IT IT IS A TRAGIC THAT WE SEE ARBITRATION IS THIS GREAT PANACEA AS A SHORT CUT TO JUSTICE BECAUSE THERE REALLY IS NOT. AND I SAY THAT NOT JUST AS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL BUT AS A PERSON WENT TO ARBITRATION I WOULD NEVER GO TO ARBITRATION AGAIN. IT IS TRULY A VIOLATION OF YOUR RIGHTS IS NOT ALWAYS A SHORT QUICK THING. YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ATTORNEY AND IT IS SOMETIMES EXPENSIVE. AND THOSE WHO HEAR THE CASES ARE NOT ALWAYS THE BEST PEOPLE TO HEAR CASES. AND THEY GENERALLY ARE GOING TO FAVOR THE EMPLOYER BECAUSE THAT'S THE PEOPLE KEEP USING THEIR SERVICES. SO I MEAN THAT ONLY THAT GO TO ARBITRATION HAD TO. COMPLAIN AFTERWARDS BECAUSE OF THE PROCESS AND YOU DON'T FEEL THIS IS SHOW THAT YOU'VE GOTTEN JUSTICE AND SO I THINK. THE FACT THAT SO MANY FOLKS ARE BEING FORCED INTO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE MONEY THEY MAY I HAVE THIS MAY HAVE THAT. YOU KNOW IT JOB IT REALLY DOES PLAY TO THOSE WHO ARE AT LEAST. ABLE TO AFFORD JUSTICE AND THEN YOU AFTER THE PROCESS YOU STILL HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN A JUSTICE SOMETIMES THAT YOU WANT THERE'S SOME ARBITRATION GOES WELL BUT I'VE. HEARD NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO WOULD IT IS NOT DONE WELL AND SO I THINK THE MORE WE CAN. CONTINUE TO LOOK ARBITRATION AS AN OPTION AND NOT A REQUIREMENT AND THAT'S THE WHOLE CHANNELS IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE AN OPTION AND NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR YOU TO GET A JOB OR GET A HOUSE OR. OR THE KID TO GO TO A PARTICULAR SCHOOL OR WHATEVER BABY YOU STILL SHOULD HAVE IT SHOULD BE AN OPTION. BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE SO THIS FORCED ON INDIVIDUALS AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FOR I KNOW WE'RE CROSSING KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF ARBITRATION. AND AND I MOST FOLKS THINK ARBITRATION IS SUPPOSED TO BE VOLUNTARY AND NOT A PRE CONDITION FOR GETTING SOMETHING OF THAT'S THEY A CYPRESS SHAPE THAT THE BILL THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK. AND UP I TOTALLY SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COME. SEEING NONE WAS CONSULTS LUXURY MIKLOS THANK YOU I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S GREAT TO HAVE A COMMITTEE SO ENGAGE ON THIS TOPIC WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT AND I'M ONE OF THE STEPS IN ADDRESSING. WHAT WE'VE SEEN AS AS WORKPLACE HARASSMENT ASSAULT COM? PAY INEQUITY YOU NAME IT REALLY SHINING A LIGHT ON THESE ISSUES I'M AGAIN I I WANT TO REITERATE THAT WE ARE NOT TAKE AWAY THE RIGHT OF ANY PLAINTIFF TO SEEK ARBITRATION. WE'RE JUST ENSURING THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A MARKETPLACE OF RELIEF IT'S IT'S AN OPEN I'M WILL LET THE MARKET DECIDE IF ARBITRATION IS AS WONDERFUL AS. THE OPPONENTS PUT OUT TO BE THAT I'M SURE A GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PLAINTIFFS WILL CHOOSE THAT SO. IT JUST PROVIDES A MOTHER OPTIONS AS WELL. AT WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BUT. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION TO SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS. TO APPROPRIATIONS AGAIN GOOD LUCK THERE. HARD HARD WRITING LEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM NO CHOW. CHOW I CHIU. WEBER AYE WEBER AYE HOLDEN. KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN NO REYES AYE REYES AYE. JEWISH CHIU AYE. THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU. FIGURES TO ITEM NUMBER NINETEEN THREE ZERO EIGHT ONE THIS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. THANK YOU AND. THIS IS AN ODD THIS THIS BILL. WE WE WORKED WITH A NUMBER OF GROUPS TO CREATE DEALING WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE WORKPLACE I'D DURING THE TIME WHEN EVERYTHING WAS WITH THE ME TO MOVE IT WAS STARTING BECAUSE WE REALIZED ALTHOUGH. AT THE PRESS CARRIES A LOT WHEN YOUR EMPLOYER IS A LEGISLATOR OR WHEN YOUR EMPLOYER IS. MOVIE PRODUCER. BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAPPENS IN NEW LOW WAGE JOBS WHERE WOMEN DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE JUSTICE THROUGH. THROUGHOUT IN THEIR THEIR HARASSER IN PUBLIC AND SO WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THESE WOMEN AND AND MAN I'M HAVE RIGHTS AND. THE ABILITY TO PURSUE. I. STOP SEXUAL HARASSMENT RETALIATION. AND SO PERPETRATORS SEXUAL HARASSMENT THESE INDUSTRIES OF BOYD ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE OF A START POWER. DIFFERENCES. AND ACCORDING TO A REPORT RELEASED BY THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION ROUGHLY THREE OUT OF FOUR WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT NEVER REPORTED TO A SUPERVISOR OR MANAGER. IN. THAT'S A PROBLEM. AB THIRTY EIGHTY ONE TAKES A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES THIS BILL ENSURE THAT WORKER HAS AT LEAST THREE YEARS TO FILE SPECIAL HURT. HARASSMENT RELATED RETALIATION CLAIM IF A WORKER CHOOSES TO FILE CLAIM THE BILL ESTABLISH A NINETY DAY REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF UNLAWFUL RETALIATION. AND ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD HOLD LABOR CONTRACTORS ACCOUNTABLE BY REQUIRING CIVIL LIABILITY FOR CASES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT ASSAULT IN DISCRIMINATION. UNDER THIS BILL WORKERS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A HOTLINE AND TO REPORT OR UNDER START TO LEARN HOW TO REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. IN A MEANS TO SUBMIT A WRITTEN COMPLAINT THAT ALLOWS WORKERS THE OPTION TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE KNOW A LOT OF THESE WOMEN. IN PARTICULAR ARE IMMIGRANT AND WOMEN WHO FACE I. IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES IF THEY COME FORWARD. AGAINST THEIR EMPLOYER. FINALLY THIRTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE WHAT THIRTY EIGHTY ONE WOULD REQUIRE EMPLOYERS WITH AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES TO PROVIDE SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING TO ALL EMPLOYEES EVERY TWO YEARS. THIS IS A DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THIS WE'VE OFTEN OF COURSE REQUIRED WITH WITH LARGER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE US SUPERVISORS WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING WHAT WE'RE LEARNING IS MORE AND MORE THAT. OUR EMPLOYEES DON'T UNDERSTAND. OR DON'T KNOW THE LAW SO OFTEN DON'T KNOW. THAT THEY CAN AS A GRIEVOUS SITUATION WHEN THEY'VE BEEN SEXUALLY HARASSED AYE OR WHAT THEY SHOULD DO IF THAT'S HAPPENING. AND MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. IS PRESENTING AB TWENTY NINE FORTY SIX WHICH HAS SIMILAR PROVISIONS TO EXTEND THE STATUTE LIMITATIONS ON RETALIATES ON. FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT RETALIATION AYE NOW ASSEMBLY WOMAN RAY HAS HAD ON ON THE FILING OF THE CLAIM ITSELF. AND WE WANT THEM ALL TO WORK TOGETHER AND SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THEY ALL. ARE DOING THE SAME THING AND GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. WITH MEDITATE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY EIGHTY ONE IS CAITLYN BAKER AT WITH KATHLEEN LABOR FEDERATION. MR CHEN MEMBERS KITTEN BAKER FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE ARE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. AND WE WORKED UP CLOSELY WHAT THE AUTHOR TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF THE LAWS THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BENEFIT IN PARTICULAR ASSEMBLY THE MOST VULNERABLE WOMEN THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND. AFTER THIS KIND OF INITIAL FOCUS ON HOLLYWOOD AND SOME OF THE MORE GLAMOROUS EXAMPLES. WE STARTED WE JUST STARTED TO HEAR MORE ABOUT WOMEN RESTAURANT WORKERS WOMEN FARMWORKERS WOMEN JANITORS WHO HAVE BEEN FIGHTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT FOR MANY YEARS THEY JUST HAVEN'T BEEN. THE FOCUS OF THE MEDIA ATTENTION ON WOMEN HOUSEKEEPERS WHO HAVE FOUGHT FOR SAFER CONDITIONS WHEN THEY'RE GOING INTO ROOMS. FOR THE KIND OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT THEY FACE AND WHAT WE TRIED TO DO WITH THIS BILL IS BUILT UPON ALL ABOUT WORK AS WELL AS THE WORK OF MS RIGHT YES AND. ADJUSTING THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS TO SAY THAT GOES HAND IN HAND WITH RETALIATION MOST CALIFORNIA WORKERS ARE OUT WELL CAN BE FIRED AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON UNLESS IT'S ON THE SHORT LIST OF. UP PROHIBITED REASONS THAT MEANS THAT MOST WORKERS SERVE AT THE MERCY OF THEIR EMPLOYER THEY CANNOT SPEAK OUT THEY CANNOT COMPLAIN THEY CANNOT FILE A CLAIM OR THEY WILL BE FIRED. AND FOR THAT REASON WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LAW IS MORE PROTECTIVE OF THOSE WORKERS THAT WHEN WORKERS COME FORWARD AND FILE A CLAIM. FOR EXAMPLE THAT THERE'S A IT IF THEY GET FIRED RIGHT AFTER THEY FILE A CLAIM THERE SHOULD BE A PRESUMPTION THAT THEY WERE FIRED BECAUSE THEY SPOKE OUT ABOUT THAT CLAIM. AND THE EMPLOYER I. HAS ALL OF THE TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO SHOW IF THERE WAS A LEGITIMATE REASON BUT A LOW WAGE IMMIGRANT WOMAN WHO'S FACING SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND TRIES TO REPORT IT AND GETS FIRED. IS IN A MUCH HARDER POSITION TO TRY TO ESTABLISH THAT IT WAS RETALIATORY BECAUSE AGAIN SHE THAT WELLING CAN GET FIRED FOR ANY REASON. AND THE OTHER ISSUE WE'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS HERE OUR ECONOMY IS INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON CONTRACTED OUT AND TEMPORARY WORKERS ALMOST ALL OF THE JOBS CREATED SINCE THE LAST RECESSION. ARE IN CONTRACTED OUT AND TEMPORARY WORK WHAT THEY CALL CONTINGENT WORK THESE WORKERS ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE BECAUSE THE MASTER EMPLOYER A RECALL CLIENT EMPLOYER. HAS CONTRACTORS COME IN AND OUT THOSE CONTRACTORS PROVIDE THE TO SUPERVISION AND THEN WHEN WORKERS RIGHTS ARE VIOLATED THE KLAN EMPLOYER SAYS I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT BLAME THE CONTRACTORS AND NOTHING EVER CHANGES. WHAT THIS BILL SAYS IS WE SHOULD APPLY THE SAME PROVISIONS THAT WE HAVE NOW FOR WAGE THEFT? WHERE THE CLIENT EMPLOYER IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE IF THEIR CONTRACTOR ENGAGES IN WAGE THAT AFTER VIOLATIONS OF WORKER HEALTH TO HEALTH AND SAFETY WE SHOULD APPLY THOSE SAME PROTECTIONS TO SEXUAL ASSAULT? HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION SO THIS BILL REALLY SEEKS TO PLUG SOME OF THESE HOLES TO LOOK AT ON FRONT LOOK AT THESE ISSUES FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS.

PLAN WITH REGARDS TO ISSUES THAT ARE ALREADY PROTECTED AGAIN UP WITHIN THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. EMPLOYEES ARE ALREADY PROTECTED AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT LAST YEAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ INTRODUCED A BILL REGARDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH DISCRIMINATION ALSO PLACING THAT IN THE LABOR CODE. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO PLACE THESE PROTECTIONS IN THE LABOR CODE THE GOVERNOR IN HIS VETO SAID I BELIEVE THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS SHOULD REMAIN WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING HAS VERY STRICT REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES REGARDING TRAINING NOTICE RETALIATION AND ALL OF THE MOST OF THINGS COVERED IN THIS BILL. AND INCLUDING UNDER THE CODE OF CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS ELEVEN OO TO THREE IT ACTUALLY STATE EVEN THE FONT SIZE AT THESE NOTIFICATIONS HAVE TO BEPUBLISHED SO THEREFORE THESE ARE HIGHLY REGULATED PROVISIONS. AND IT WILL SIMPLY EXPOSE EMPLOYERS TO ADDITIONAL LIABILITY UNDER THEY. PA GOT UNDER THE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT BY PLACING THIS WITHIN THE LABOR CODE IT CREATES AN UNFAIR REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AGAINST EMPLOYERS FOR EXAMPLE AND TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION HOWEVER IF SOMEONE WERE TO FILE. A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIM AND WAS ALREADY ENGAGED IN OR CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN FRAUD AGAINST THE EMPLOYER THEY WITH THEN THERE WOULD BE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT THE. PLAINTIFF OR THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WAS TERMINATED BECAUSE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE BURDEN OF PROOF THEN FALLS ON THE EMPLOYER TO PROVE OTHERWISE RATHER THAN BEING ON THE EMPLOYEE TO PROVE THAT THEY WERE NOT THAT THAT THAT THEY WORK TERMINATED BECAUSE OF. THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS FINALLY THE JOINT EMPLOYER LIABILITY THERE IS NO REASON THAT A CONTRACTOR SHOULD OR WOULD BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THE. COMPANY THAT THEY HIRED TO PROVIDE SERVICES WITH FOLLOWING THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT THAT'S A LIABILITY ON THE COMPANY THAT HIRES THESE EMPLOYEES AND HAS THESE EMPLOYEES AS THEIR WORKERS THERE SHOULD NOT BE JOINT EMPLOYER LIABILITY UNDER THIS PROVISION BECAUSE THERE ALREADY IS JOIN PLAYER LIABILITY. DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF CONTROL JOINT EMPLOYERS HAVE IT WHO EXPENDED SAYS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CONTROL OVER OTHER EMPLOYEES ALREADY DO HAVE JOINT EMPLOYER LIABILITY CURRENTLY UNDER THE LAW AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSITION AB THIRTY EIGHTY ONE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SHAUN THOSE OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING. OVER TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ACROSS THE STATE ALSO POSE FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR MEMBERSHIPS AS WE PREVIOUSLY TALKED ABOUT IN A PREVIOUS COMMITTEE. OUR MEMBERS ON AVERAGE HAVE THREE TO TEN EMPLOYEES A VERY VERY SMALL EMPLOYERS WHICH IS VERY COMMON PICTURE ANYTHING ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. IN THE STATE AND THAT ONE OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A LARGER EMPLOYERS ARE MEMBERS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS DON'T HAVE AN ENTIRE DEPARTMENT DEDICATED TO HUMAN RESOURCES OR COMPLIANCE OR LEGAL OR PAYROLL. THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER INDIVIDUALLY IS TRYING TO COMPLY. WITH ARE ALREADY VERY COMPLEX LABOR LAWS REQUIREMENTS AND UNFORTUNATELY WE VIEW THIS BILL WOULD CREATE ADDITIONAL. CONTRADICTIONS AND DUPLICATIONS ARMS SPECIFICALLY BY ADDING A SEXUAL HARASSMENT PROTECTIONS IN TRAINING REQUIREMENTS DIRECTLY TO THE LABOR CODE ITSELF IT WOULD BE A CONFUSING TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. BUT ALSO OPEN OUR MEMBERS TO ADDITIONAL. WAVE OF LITIGATION UNDER PAGO WHICH WE THINK SEPARATELY IS OVERDUE FOR REFORM ITSELF. BUT NONE OF THIS WOULD DO ANYTHING TO INCREASE OUR ALREADY VERY COMPLICATED AND HOSTILE LEGAL CLIMATE IN THE STATE. OF SO FINALLY JUST WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE FACT THAT THIS BILL. REALLY ADDS NO PROTECTIONS BILL WHAT'S ALREADY AVAILABLE IN FEE HOT IN THE FE H.

AND THE JPA BECAME INSOLVENT. WHEN CITIES OF AZUSA COVINA GLENDORA WEST COVINA. THAT CREATED THE JPA SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE JP'S OBLIGATIONS. CALPERS WAS FORCED TO CUT THE PAY PENSIONS OF THE JP EIGHT RETIREES BY UP TO SIXTY THREE PERCENT. LAST YEAR MY COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY PERSON COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT COMMITTEE DISCUSS THIS AMONGST MANY OTHER ISSUES. SINCE SINCE THEN WE HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY XTO ON OTHER JP HAYES THAT CONTRACT WITH CALPERS AN UNKNOWN NUMBER. THAT CONTRACT WITH OTHER PUBLIC PENSION SYSTEMS WHERE THE PROBLEM COULD HAPPEN AGAIN THAT WOULD EFFECT AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE RETIREMENT SECURITY TO THE. EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES OF A JPA BY REQUIRING THAT MEMBER AGENCY BE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR THE JP'S RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. WHICH WILL APPLY TO EXISTING AND FUTURE CONTRACTS. AND ALSO REQUIRED THAT THE RETIREMENT LIABILITY BE APPORTIONED AMONG THE JP HAYES MEMBER AGENCIES. I MET SOME WITH WITH SOME OF THE POINTS TO HEAR THEIR CONCERNS AND RESPONSE AMENDED THE BILL LAST WEEK TO CLARIFY LIABILITY. AND APPORTIONMENT OF RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. I MOURN STAND AT THEIR MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THIS BILL TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS LIKE LIABILITY.

APPORTION THEIR LIABILITY OR ACCEPT. JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY THIS IS FOR THE. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY. MEMBERS OF THE EXISTING JP HAYES WHO ARE NOW AT RISK IF THE SAME THING HAPPENS TO THEM THAT HAPPENED IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY. WITHOUT A OR TRITE THOUGH THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. JOSH WHAT LOCAL WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES IN SUPPORT. ACTUALLY MARTINEZ ON BEHALF OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION LOCAL ONE THOUSAND AND STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE A DILLON GIVENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I WAS OUT IS GONNA AFFECT YOUR OF FAKING THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US AND TRY AND. FIND SOME WORKABLE SOLUTIONS AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE IN THOSE EFFORTS LIKE TO THINK TERRY FOR HIS KIND WORDS. WHEN WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS BILL RELATED TO GPAS. GOING FORWARD. GPAS FORMED. THIS POINT GOING FORWARD LEGISLATION IS UNNECESSARY CALPERS IS ALREADY TAKEN ACTIONS. THAT WOULD REQUIRE. SOME FORM OF LIABILITY PRIOR TO JPA SIGNING A CONTRACT. HOWEVER ARE CONCERNED IS RELATED TO THE RETROACTIVITY OF THE LEGISLATION. AND APPLYING. ACCRUED LIABILITIES THAT VICTORY ACCRUED OVER THIRTY PLUS YEARS. TO. MEMBERS OF THE JPA WHO AY NEVER HAVE JOINED TO JPA HAD. THOSE LIABILITIES BEEN ASSIGNED TO THEM. THIS BUT ALSO ASSIGNED Y. BELIEVES TWO MINUTES FORMER MEMBERS HAVE A JPA SO THEY RENTED JPA. THEY LEFT DURING NO TIME WITH THEIR REMEMBER THAT GPA DO THEY HAVE ANY OF THOSE LIABILITIES YET NOW AFTER LEAVING THE GPA. BIG LIABILITY WAS ACCRUED DURING THAT TIME WOULD BE APPORTIONED BACK TO THEM. ADDITIONALLY WE BELIEVE THAT THIS LEGISLATION WILL ACTUALLY RESULT IN THE CLOSURE. OF NUMEROUS GPAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHEN PROVIDED THE THE OPTION OF ACCEPTING LIABILITY. NOW AND GOING FORWARD. THEY'RE GOING TO CHOOSE TO NOT ACCEPT THAT LIABILITY. OF THE JPA WILL HAVE NO OTHER OPTION WOULD WHEN THEY'RE WITH CALPERS OTHER THAN TO. TERMINATE THEIR CONTRACT AND PAY OUT THERE ACCRUED LIABILITY. ENTERING INTO THE TAP FUNDED AT CALPERS AND THE JPA WILL BE ELIMINATED. THOSE LIABILITIES UNDER THIS LAW WOULD WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO THOSE MEMBER AGENCIES. A HOWEVER THEY WOULD ACCRUE NO ADDITIONAL LIABILITY BECAUSE THE CONTRACT WOULD BE CLOSED. THERE FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING SERVED BY THOSE GPAS WITH WOULD LOSE OUT ON THOSE SERVICES WHILE SOME OF THOSE SERVICES MAY BE PICKED UP BY SOME OF THEM THE MEMBER AGENCIES. THAT THE REASON THEY FOR THE JPA WAS TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES IN A MORE COST EFFECTIVE. AND EFFICIENT MANNER. CLUB SO. WHILE. THIS BILL IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR OUR AGENCIES TO. ADDRESS AND BE ABLE TO PORTION THAT LIABILITY AND. AND I I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE THE AUTHOR. IS GOING TO WORK ON THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS SOME. ISSUES WITH DRAFTING AND AND GETTING IT DONE QUICKLY IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED FOR THIS COMMITTEE. I WE DO UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR WITH THAT. HOWEVER WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF SERVICES. TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SERVED BY GPS. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS BUT STAFF ARE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DOROTHY JOHNSON THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ALIGN MY COMMENTS ABOUT WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS BUT. MAYBE ONCE A PERSON FOR MOST OUR GOALS HERE ARE THE SAME WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE BENEFITS REDUCED OR ELIMINATED FOR OUR PUBLICS AS SERVICE SECTOR EMPLOYEES. IT'S A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WAY THAT WE CAN RECRUIT RETAIN. LONG TERM EMPLOYEES. WE SHARE THAT SINGLE WE DON'T THINK COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THIS SOLUTION OUT WE HAVE SHARED WITH THE PRIOR COMMITTEE A FEW DIFFERENT IDEAS OF HOW WE CAN. MAKE SURE THAT GPA OBLIGATIONS ARE FULLY PAGE SAID THEY FACED AT THE SOLUTION. THIS DEALS WITH US SOLUTION SO MUCH OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION ABOUT BY TRANSPARENCY EARLIER NOTIFICATION. IF THERE'S CHANGES TO THE FUNDING STATUS. THAT WOULD NEED TO BE MADE MUCH MORE APPARENT BUT UNFORTUNATELY AGAIN. APPLIES RETROACTIVELY TO GPAS THAT HAVE ALREADY SIGNED CONTRACTS WE WOULD BE AYE BY YOU KNOW MUCH MORE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL IF IT WAS APPLYING TO FUTURE CONTRACTS WHICH CALPERS PUTTING IN PLACE. UP AGAIN FOR THE REASONS STATED BY MY COLLEAGUE WE ARE CURRENTLY OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE EXTRA SPACE WHICH CHAIR MEMBERS GREG COOK REPRESENTING OF THE CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY. APOLOGIZE WE HAVE NOT GIVEN YOUR COMMITTEE A LETTER NORDIN HAVE DISCUSSED WITH YOUR STAFF WE HAVE MET WITH MISTER RODRIGUEZ STAFF. AND. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT OUR ORGANIZATION WERE FIFTY YEARS OLD WE PROVIDE ELECTRIC SERVER FOR SIXTEEN COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS. WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS BILL BE AMENDED TO REQUIRE. SOMETHING OUR AGENCY HAS ALREADY DONE A RESOLUTION SIGNED BY ALL OF ITS MEMBERS THAT A DATE CERTAIN IN OUR CASE FIFTEEN YEARS. THESE FUNDS WILL BE FULLY FUNDED. NUMBER TWO THAT AN AUDIT BE CONDUCTED AT OUR EXPENSE. TO BE SURE. PURSE THAT CALPERS THAT THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO FULFILL THAT RESOLUTION REQUIREMENT. NUMBER THREE THAT WE PROVIDE THAT AUDIT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO CALPERS IN ADDITION TO AN ANNUAL REPORT TO CALPERS AND HOW WE ARE PROGRESSING. AND FINALLY WE SUGGEST THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED TO. ADD TO THE WORD. ASSET TO OF TO MAKE THAT REAL PROPERTY NOT JUST PROPERTY BECAUSE OF THE THE VALUE OF REAL PROPERTY. WILL STAY IF THERE WERE ANY PROBLEMS WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE WE GOT GREAT ASSETS ARE GOVERNING BOARD IS COMMITTED TO MAKING THIS WORK OUR AGENCIES ARE WORKING WITH US VERY CAREFULLY. AND SO AT THIS POINT WE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO OPPOSE THE BILL BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. TO SEE IF WE CAN ADD SOME OF THESE. SUGGESTIONS WE HAVE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE CHRIST STAPLING BORDERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWER THIRTIES WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY CONTINUE OUR STAKEHOLDERS. PROPOSED. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DAVID JONES OF THE HALF THE CITIES OF BURBANK PERIOD AND SAN MARCUS IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PLUG INS OFFICE REVERSING THE CITY'S A GLENDORA INDIAN WELLS LA MIRADA LAKE WOULD PALMDALE RANCHO CUCAMONGA AND WEST COVINA ALL POST. MONNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MERCYME MAGO BEHALF WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC POWER THIRTY ALSO OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KURT BLACKBURN ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF LOCKING OUT OF FLINTRIDGE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING GENE HEARST ON BEHALF OF THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OPPOSE. GOOD MORNING REYES INDIVIDUALLY FOR PRESENTING THE CITIES OF SENATE TELL FOSTER CITY IN BELMONT STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEE NOT A BRING BACK THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS MISTER KALRA AND THE MISTER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND THANK YOU CENTER OF WHO GETS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. UP I THINK THIS THE KIND OF RESPONSIVENESS THAT. OUR CONSTITUENTS IT CERTAINLY DOES THAT WORK IN THESE PUBLIC AGENCIES EXPECT OF US AFTER. WE SEE SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY NO ONE EXPECTED I THINK W. WORKING. AND YOU YOU. THE ARE DOING YOUR JOB IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND THAT'S WHAT THOSE FOLKS ARE READING OF THE JP IS ARE DOING. YOU YOU EXPECT TO GET THE OF THE BENEFITS THAT WERE PROMISED YOU. IN AN AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD ABDICATE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO WORKERS. BECAUSE IT HAPPENED IT. BECAUSE JURISDICTIONS TO BE. MEMBERS OF JP HAYES AB SERVED ON LEAST COUPLE DIFFERENT APA'S IN MY TIME IN OFFICE. AND I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THAT THE THAT THIS IS NOT EASY AND IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE. AYE WHICH AGAIN I FURTHER COMMEND YOU COULD BRING UP LOWERED BECAUSE IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE FOR CERTAINLY MANY THE JP HAYES I GET THAT AND AND. I APPRECIATE CALPERS DOING THEIR. DUTY IN THEIR PART IN RESPONDING SO LEASE PROSPECTIVELY. OTHER ISSUE WON'T REOCCUR. BUT THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULD SIT IDLY BY. IN IN TERMS OF DOING TAKING RETROACTIVE ACTION. I UNDERSTAND THAT. THE JURISDICTIONS TO NESTLE KNOW. OF OF A POTENTIAL OP GAZE HOWEVER THEY DO THEY ARE. AS PART OF THE GPAS. YOU KNOW THEY DO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT. THE WORK GETS DONE. THE WORD DOES GET DONE FOR THEIR BENEFIT. AND THAT THE WERE A THEIR WORKERS ARE WORKING HARD TO MAKE IT HAPPEN THE. JUST LIKE THE CITIES OR OTHER JUST EXISTING CHOOSE. A TO ENTER THE JP IS WITH THIS AS UNDERSTANDING THE WORKERS THEMSELVES ALSO DID NOT CHOOSE. TO HAVE THEIR BENEFITS SLASH BECAUSE THEY CHOSE TO WORK IN PUBLIC SERVICE FOR THE BENEFIT OF A JPA IT THEY HAD MAYBE THEY WOULD HAVE DOES NOT WORK FOR JPA. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIX THIS I AGREE WITH WITH EVERYONE THAT SPOKE ON BOTH SIDES AND IT IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE. AND I HOPE EVERYONE WILL COME TO THE TABLE. AND AND GOING FORWARD FIGURE OUT WAYS THAT WE HOPE THAT NONE OF THE JP IS DISSOLVED. BUT THAT BEING SAID LET'S HAVE SOME A CONTINGENCY PLANS IN PLACE SO THAT. THOUGH THE WORKERS ARE MADE WHOLE AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WITH THIS BILL OF IT DOES FORCE THAT CONVERSATION UP FORCE THAT COMPLICATED. MOOD THAT ARRANGES TO ME MADE BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY DOABLE AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRING THE BILL FOR IT TO URGE ON THOSE OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS THING THAT I'M OF THE BILL. SO THERE'S A MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM. YEAH I JUST HAVE KIND OF A TECHNICAL QUESTION AYE AYE KNOWS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT IN SOME PLACES IN THE BILL USES THE LANGUAGE JOINED SEVERAL LIABILITY AND OTHER PLACES THE TALKS ABOUT APPORTIONMENT. OTHERS ARE VERY DIFFERENT THINGS WITH VERY DIFFERENT FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE. DEPARTING MEMBERS OF THE JPA AS WONDER IF YOU COULD ADDRESS. THAT ISSUE PARTICULARLY. A WHAT IS THE INTENT IS THE INTENT FOR JOINED SEVERAL HOURS INTENT FOR ABORTION. I. THE BILL STARTED ITS JOINT AND SEVERAL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT CALPERS REQUESTED DETACHED. THE DORM A LEGAL STANDARD YOU. ARE FAMILIAR WITH AND IN THE PROCESS OF TALKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND THE JPA FOLKS PRINCIPALLY. WE ASKED HIM. IF IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU HAD A PORTION ANOTHER WORD. GAS BE REPORTING LET IT TAKE THE SAN GABRIEL CASE THERE WAS NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF UNFUNDED LIABILITY. IF EACH ENTITY THE SEVEN PARTICIPATE. EACH HAD TO REPORT NINETEEN MILLION OF UNFUNDED LIABILITY ON THEIR REPORTING. YOU'RE YOU'RE OVER. REPORTING THE ACTUAL LIABILITY SO WE OFFERED UP THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD. A PORTION THAT AMONGST THE MEMBERS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE LA COUNTY WHICH WAS THE MAIN PARTICIPANTS. AND GETTING MOST OF THE BENEFIT OF THE SERVICES AND AND FOR US SIX SMALLER CITIES THAT WERE PART OF IT. THAT YOU COULD CONTRACT WITH CALPERS AND A PORTION THAT LIABILITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SERVICES YOU WERE GETTING. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO DISTRICT JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY. AND I THINK THE. S. IS RIGHTLY POINTED OUT ME ANALYSIS THE WORDING IS NOT QUITE CRAFTED. CLEARLY ENOUGH I THINK THE IDEA HERE IS YOU COULD EITHER. CONTRACT FOR. APPORTIONMENT IN IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT YOU IT WOULD BE JOINT AND SELF. OKAY SO THAT THAT LAST STATEMENT THAT'S THE INTENT AYE YES. THANK YOU THAT'S HOPE. AND ONCE AGAIN STILL ASSUME IN PROGRESS OF TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT THE QUESTION. COMMENTS. RIGHT SEEING NONE. IS RODRIGUEZ WHO MIKLOS. OR THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR TWERKING OUTLINING PROVISIONS THAT NEED CLARIFICATION I WILL CONTINUE WORK WITH INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS TOWARD ACHIEVING COMMON GROUND. AT THE END OF THE DAY IF IT PUBLIC EMPLOYER CAN JUST WALK AWAY FROM THE PROMISE OF A PENSION BECAUSE IT CAN. THAT'S NOT A PROMISE MY GOAL AT THIS BILL TO PROTECT. PRESENT AND FUTURE RETIREES ARE SPEC THAT'S RIVAL. THANK YOU SO THERE IS THE MOST IN A SECOND. YOU THE MOTIONS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. KALRA PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM CHAU. CHAO AYE CHU WEBER.

MY STAFF ON THE AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. MANY OTHER STATES HAVE STOOD BEHIND THE BEAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS BY PASSING LEGISLATION SIMILAR TO WHAT I AM PROPOSING. AND IT IS TIME CALIFORNIA FOLLOWED SUIT. IT TAKES A LOT FOR A PERSON TO GET OUT OF AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP AND WE NEED TO DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT WHEN SURVIVORS GAIN THE ABILITY TO LEAVE THEIR ABUSERS. WE ARE THERE TO SUPPORT THEM. BY MAKING THE PROCESS SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CAN ACCESS HEROES EASIER WE WILL NOT ONLY ENCOURAGE MORE SURVIVORS TO LEAVE THEIR ABUSERS BUT WE WILL ALSO HINDERED THE ABUSERS ABILITY TO CAUSE THEM FURTHER HARM. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS CHANGED OVER AND BENEFIT GOMEZ FROM UC IRVINE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CLINIC TO TESTIFY ABOUT THE URGENT NEED FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU AND YOUR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS AS OTHERS ABOUT. YES INDEPENDENT YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS VANESSA GOMEZ AND I AM A CERTIFIED LAW STUDENT INTERN IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CLINIC AT UC IRVINE SCHOOL OF LAW. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWO YEARS I HAVE OF IT ADVOCATED UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF FACULTY ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS WHO SUFFERED EXTREME. PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL MENTAL AND FINANCIAL ABUSE. AND SEEKING COURT ORDER PROTECTION FROM THIS ABUSE MANY OF THESE CLIENTS FACE SOME SIGNIFICANT HURDLES IN CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL SYSTEM. CURRENT LINE SOME CALIFORNIA COUNTIES REQUIRES THAT THE MASSIVE VIOLENCE VICTIMS PROVIDE ADVANCE NOTICE TO THEIR ABUSERS BEFORE FILING FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER TARA. IN A SURVEY OF THE FIFTY CALIFORNIA COUNTIES CONDUCTED BY OUR CLINIC THE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS VARY FROM A MINIMUM FOUR HOURS TWENTY SEVEN HOURS PRIOR TO HEARING. JUDGES CAN WAIVE THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT FOR GOOD CAUSE BUT JUDICIAL APPROACH IS VERY AMPUTATION OURS ARE GENERALLY UNDER WHERE THEY GOOD CAUSE EXCEPTION EXCESS. OUR CLIENTS PARENTS NOTICED ISSUES FIRSTHAND WHEN REPRESENTING OUR CLIENTS. IN ASSISTING MY VERY FIRST CLINIC CLIENT I SAT FOR HOURS WITH HER IN THE COURTHOUSE AS OUR CELL PHONE RANG IN THE SLEEVE WITH CAL CALLS FROM HER ABUSER AFTER SHE GAVE. HIM NOTICE OF HER INTENDED TARA REQUEST SHE SHOOK FROM HEAD TERROR AND WATCH THE DOOR IF YOU'RE OVER THE COURSE OF THESE LONG FOUR HOURS. ALL THE WHILE TERRIFIED THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE CHILDREN FROM HER MOTHER'S HOME NOW THAT SHE THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN NOTIFIED THAT SHE WAS AT THE COURTHOUSE. MORE RECENTLY OUR CLIENT J. AFFECTS SUFFERED REPEATED REPETITIOUS SEVERE ABUSE INCLUDING HORRIFIC BRUISING A BLACK EYE AND A MISCARRIAGE FROM AND LESS BLOWS HER STOMACH. WHEN FILING A PETITION FOR ITS HERO THE JUDGE REQUIRED US TO PROVIDE FOREIGN NOTICED HER CLIENTS ABUSER.

ANY HAD BEEN ALERTED NOW THAT WE WOULD BE SEARCHING FOR HIM FOR SERVICE. REQUIRE VICTIMS SERVER PROVIDE ADVANCE NOTICE WHEN SEEKING A TAROT IS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS BECAUSE A TIME WHEN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM LEAVES A RELATIONSHIP IS THE GREATEST TIME EVER. HI AND VIOLENCE AND FATALITY RECURRENCE SUCH NOTICE ALERTED USERS US INTO EXACT TIME AND LOCATION OF WHERE TO FIND THE VICTIM. IT ALSO COULD TIP OFF AN ABUSER AND PUMP PARENTS WANT ABDUCTION ADDITIONALLY A PROVIDES A TOOL FOR ABUSERS CHILLER IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS IN THE EVENT THE VICTIM DOES NOT HAVE SECURE LEGAL STATUS IN THE U. S.. IN RESPONSE TO POSSIBLE CONCERNED ABOUT REMOVING THE TERROR NOTICE REQUIREMENT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MULTIPLE OTHER STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED SUCH MEASURES AND FOUND THEM. THAT THEY SATISFY DUE PROCESS. ALSO IT'S HEROES ARE VERY LIMITED DURATION AND CAN BE VACATED. AB TWENTY SIX NINETY FOUR WILL AMEND THE CURRENT LAW BY PREVENTING A TAROT FROM BEING TONIGHT TO VICTIMS SOLELY ON THE BASIS. OF LACK OF NOTICE TO RESPOND. BY REMOVING THESE BARRIERS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS THE MANDELA FACILITATED AND NECESSARY COURT ORDER PERFECT PROTECTION IN CALIFORNIA I FULLY SUPPORT AB TWENTY SIX NINETY FOUR. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JANE STOVER AND A LAW PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. SCHOOL OF LAW WHERE I TEACH PAMELA AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAW. AND DIRECT OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CLINIC AS A COACH PARA COUNTIES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DEATH REVIEW TEAM. I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX NINETY FOUR ON BEHALF OF MULTIPLE CLIENTS OF OUR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CLINIC FOR CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ACCESS TO SAFETY MEASURES. THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL STANDARDS AND INDIAN. AND OR ADVANCEMENTS I CAN SPEAK THIS BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE REPRESENTING ABUSE SURVIVORS IN CALIFORNIA AND SIX OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND CONDUCTING NATIONWIDE RESEARCH. MINUTE FOCUS MY TESTIMONY ON THE NEED FOR ALTERNATIVE SERVICE METHODS. CLEARLY BE AVAILABLE IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER CASES. CURRENTLY AT THE PETITIONER IS UNABLE TO PERSONALLY SERVE THE RESPONDENT WITH THE RESTRAINING ORDER PETITION AND NOTICE OF HEARING. SOME COUNTIES LOCAL RULES REQUIRE THAT PETITIONS BE DISMISSED AFTER ONLY ONE OR TWO HEARING DATES. EVEN THOUGH THE VICTIM SURVIVOR STILL NEEDS PROTECTION. EVEN IN COUNTIES WHERE NO SUCH LOCAL RULE EXISTS JUDGES COMMONLY DISMISS RESTRAINING ORDER CASES FOR LACK OF PERSONAL SERVICE. AFTER ONLY ONE OR TWO TARA REASSURANCE SAYS. BUT DISMISSING CASES IT LEAVING ABUSE SURVIVORS OF THAT PROTECTION IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE EVEN WHEN A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER OR RESTRAINING ORDER HAS NOT YET BEEN PERSONALLY BE SERVED ON THE RESPONDENT. THE ORDER STILL PROVIDES IMPORTANT SAFETY PROTECTIONS THAT SCHOOLS WORKPLACES AND OTHERS OBSERVE. THEREBY PREVENTING RESPONDENTS FROM ABDUCTING CHILDREN FROM DAYCARE IS OUR SCHOOLS OR FROM PAN COMING INTO PROTECTED LOCATIONS.

WHICH WOULD PROVIDE A ONE SIDED ATTORNEY FEE PROVISION TO INCENTIVIZE FURTHER LITIGATION I'M ESSENTIALLY THROUGH THE JEALOUSY PROCESS A MISTER KELLY WILL DISCUSS WITH THE BLOWER AND CLAIMS IT GENERAL I WANNA FOCUS ON WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS. WITH REGARD TO LABOR CLOSED REPRIEVE LABOR CODE RETALIATION PROVISIONS. AS DISCUSSED BEFORE THE DEAL I SEE IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT ENFORCES THE LABOR CODE AND WITHOUT THE EMPLOYEE CAN EITHER GO THROUGH THE JEALOUSY PROCESS OR THEY CAN GO THROUGH CIVIL COURT. IT'S ESSENTIALLY A CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE IT IS NOT ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY WHERE THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH ONE OR THE OTHER. AND THE D. LSE AT. INVESTIGATOR WALKS THEM THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS ESSENTIALLY HOLDING HANDS OF THE EMPLOYEE IT'S VERY EMPLOYEE FRIENDLY WHEREBY FOR THE EMPLOYER THEY'RE NOT PROVIDED A. RIGHT TO A TIMELY AND FAIR TRIAL THEY ARE ACTUALLY NOT USUALLY GIVEN A HEARING THEY DO NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT EVIDENCE THEY ARE SIMPLY A PART OF AN INVESTIGATION WHERE BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER MAKES A DETERMINATION. WITH ADDING THE ONE SIDED ATTORNEY'S FEES THE SUPERIOR COURT ACTUALLY IS THE ONE THAT. IMPOSES THE WORK BUT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S JUDGMENTS SO THE SUPERIOR COURT IF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WERE TO GIVE A JUDGMENT SAYING THAT YOU KNOW THAT I AM RECOVERY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE PLAINTIFF IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY SHOULD BE NOW PROVIDED ATTORNEYS FEES UNDER TWENTY NINE FORTY SIX. THE SUPERIOR COURT IS THE ONE THAT ENFORCES THAT JUDGMENT AND THEREFORE THERE WOULD BE NOTHING STOPPING THEM FOR PROVIDING THESE ATTORNEYS FEES WITH RATE WITHIN. REGARDS TO AB TWENTY NINE FORTY SIX SO WHAT ACTUALLY WOULD MAKE THE JEALOUSY PROCESS MORE LITIGIOUS IF THE EMPLOYEE WANTS TO GO THROUGH CIVIL COURT AND OBTAIN ATTORNEY'S FEES THAT'S A DIFFERENT ROUTE. ADDITIONALLY UNDER THIS THAT ADDITION MISTER MCKINLEY WILL TOUCH ON THIS BUT THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS FOR AND IF AN EMPLOYEE IS A WHISTLEBLOWER AND IS TAKING IT THESE TYPE OF CLAIMS. IN THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC THEY CAN ALSO SEEK ATTORNEY'S FEES UNDER CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE TEN TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE AND AND FOR THESE REASONS AMONGST OTHERS AND WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS THANK YOU SO MUCH. IF YOU MIX WITH. I MISTER CHAIR CHRIS MCKAY WE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION ARE I WANT TO KNOW FIRST THAT.

A COMBAT. WAGE THEFT I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUE WITH THE. EXTENSION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS BUT AS MISS CURTIS AND I INDICATED I THINK OUR FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN IS. THAT BY ADDING ATTORNEY'S FEES WE ARE GONNA MAKE A RATHER EMPLOYEE E. FRIENDLY DE LSE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. LESS APPEALING BECAUSE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN ATTORNEY'S FEES. IF YOU LOOK AT SUBDIVISION J. WHICH ADDS THIS AND THE LANGUAGE TALKS ABOUT A SUCCESSFUL ACTION AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE RAISED. IS WHAT DOES SUCCESSFUL ACTION MEAN DOES THAT MEAN RECOVERY. OF ONLY A DOLLAR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND IS A MISS CURTIS MENTIONED I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY ALTHOUGH THIS IS. VIEWED AS PERHAPS A WAGE IN OUR CLAIM OF THIS IS APPLICABLE ACROSS THE BOARD TO ALL ALLEGED. UNLAWFUL CLAIMS WHICH IS VERY EXPANSIVE IN THE END SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHER THAN OPPOSITION. YOU CAN GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. DAVE BUT REPRESENTING NINETY CHAMBER ADVOCACY NETWORK COALITION OF LOCAL CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE TURN THE SECOND A MARKETPLACE IN OPPOSITION. THEY FIND BORDERS ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GREAT POWER THIRTY SUPPOSED. DOROTHY JOHNSON THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN OPPOSITION. THIRTY YEARS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE FOOD PRODUCERS IN OPPOSITE. IF YOU OTHERS OPPOSE. SINGH NANDA BRING IT BACK TO THEIR COMMITTEE FOR.

US I'M REGARDING THIS BILL AND WE ARE WE SEE THAT THERE ARE SOME. AMENDMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD AND WE APPRECIATE THAT WE DO STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION TODAY. AND THAT AS FAR AS OUR UNDERSTANDING ARE NOT GOING TO BE WITHIN THE AMENDMENTS AND FIRST AND FOREMOST THERE'S A PROVISION REGARDING CONFIDENTIALITY THIS SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS DIFFERENT THAN SEXUAL ASSAULT. OR STOCKING OR ANY OF THE OTHER PROVISIONS BECAUSE THIS DOES HAPPEN IN THE WORKPLACE EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING TO CONDUCT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WHICH REQUIRES INTERVIEWING THE WITNESSES AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS WITHIN. THE EMPLOYMENT ROWMAN SO THEREFORE THE EMPLOYER CANNOT GUARANTEE CONFIDENTIALITY OF AN IMPLICATION. OF AN EMPLOYEE WHO IS TAKING TIME OFF FROM WORK BECAUSE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ADDITIONALLY THE EMPLOYER WOULD BE IN VIOLATION OF THE HOT THEY DID NOT CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION OUR CONCERN IS THAT IF AN EMPLOYEE WHO TAKES TIME OFF. AND THAT IS THAT TAKES HIM OFF IN THE EMPLOYEE CANNOT CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THE EMPLOYER WOULD THEN BE AN IMPLICATION OF WAGING OUR VIOLATIONS IF YOU ARE ASKING OVER AN INDIVIDUAL QUESTIONS. OF OR REQUESTING THAT THEY COME INTO THE OFFICE FOR AN INVESTIGATION THAN THERE ARE WHICH OUR A VIOLATIONS AS WELL AS. FMLA AND OTHER CIFRA VIOLATIONS THAT WOULD OCCUR AND SO THERE IS KIND OF THAT ISSUE HOW DO YOU CONDUCT A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION MOM PLAYS OFF ON PROTECTED THE. ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE EXTENDING THE LEAVE TO FAMILY MEMBERS IS ALSO EXTREMELY BURDENSOME ON AN EMPLOYER BECAUSE IT WOULD EXTEND THIS PROTECTION TO IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS AND THERE'S NO NOTICE REQUIREMENT FOR THESE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE FOR IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE OFF TIME OFF BECAUSE YOUR SISTER I'D. AND BUSINESS EIGHT WAS SEXUALLY HARASSED AND THEN YOU LET YOUR EMPLOYER KNOW THAT YOU ARE TAKING TIME OFF BECAUSE YOUR SISTER IS WAS HARASSED YOUR EMPLOYER AT EMPLOYMENT BE WITH AND HAVE TO PROVIDE YOU THAT PROTECTED TIME OFF WITHOUT ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THERE BE A COURT DOCUMENT ANY SORT. OF NOTICE REQUIREMENT FROM A MEDICAL PROVIDER SO ACTUALLY THE FADE FROM OUR PLANE READING OF THE LANGUAGE ACTUALLY PROVIDES MORE EXTENSIVE PROTECTIONS TO AN EMPLOYEE AT. AND OF A FAMILY MEMBER THAT'S BEEN ALLEGEDLY HARASSED OR I'M A VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND AM FINALLY CONCLUSION WITH THAT WE ARE JUST CONCERNED OF THE ADDITIONAL LITIGATION BECAUSE ONCE YOU PROVIDE A PROTECTED LEAVE THAN ANY ACTION TAKEN ON THAT EMPLOYEE COULD IMPLICATES. DISCRIMINATION OR RETALIATION FOR TAKING THAT PROTECTED TIME OFF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND WE APPRECIATE. THANK YOU EXODUS. MISTER CHAIRED YOU HAVE ANY PRIOR BILLS IN THIS AREA SO I DON'T. HAVE ANY MORE OVERSIGHT EQUIPMENT NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF OKAY GOOD. WELL HOW AM I IF I COULD DRAW YOU THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIR YOU IN YOUR MEMBERS TO THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FIVE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND WHICH. STAFF INDICATES THAT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT VICTIMS WILL TAKE TIME OFF FOR LIGHTER FRIVOLOUS REASONS IS MITIGATED BY THE FACT THAT AND IMPLORE YOU MUST PROVIDE CERTIFICATION IT'S ENTERED CETERA. LET ME DO IN ADDITION TO MISS CURTIS'S POLICY CONCERNS LET ME JUST GO TO THE LANGUAGE AND BUT BEFORE I DO THAT THINK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR. TAKING A NUMBER OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE. HAVE WORKED ON A WITH HIM AND HIS STAFF BUT LET ME POINT OUT TO ISSUES THEN BASED UPON THAT. IN SUBDIVISION  <u><c.green>ONE AN</c></u> EMPLOYEE HAS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ADVANCE NOTICE UNLESS IT'S NOT FEASIBLE. IT'S AFTER THE FACT OKAY IN E. TO WHEN AN UNSCHEDULED ABSENCE OCCURRED THEN WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME AFTER THAT ABSENCE THEN THE CERTIFICATION IS REQUIRED. WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME ADVANCE CERTIFICATION. BUT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS COMMENT IN YOUR ANALYSIS ALLUDES TO BUT AGAIN THE CERTIFICATION. ONLY OCCURS AFTER THE FACT. AND THEN ALSO IN SITU DEALING WITH THE FAMILY MEMBER. WE HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BREATH OF THE DEFINITION FOUND IN THE BILL THE AUTHOR HAS REFERENCE SECTION TWO FORTY FIVE POINT FIVE. TO DEFINE A FAMILY MEMBER WHICH IS ACTUALLY BROADER. I THINK THAN WHAT WAS CONTAINED IN THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE BILL BUT SUCH BUDGET TO SAY I THINK THE CONCERN WITH THE FAMILY MEMBER IS. THERE'S NO DOCUMENTATION THERE. SO THIS IS A SECONDARY EMPLOYER THE ONE EMPLOYEE I SUFFERED SEXUAL HARASSMENT. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT CETERA FOR THE FAMILY MEMBER. THEY CAN TAKE THAT LEAVE AND THERE'S NO CERTIFICATION OR DOCUMENTATION RELATED TO THAT LEAVE FOR THAT SECOND EMPLOYER SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME CERTIFICATION THERE. AND SOME CLARIFICATION IN SITU OR ACTUALLY SEE ONE FOR THE ADVANCE NOTICE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN OPPOSITION. THIRTY YEARS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE FOOD PRODUCERS IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. COMMENTS. AND IF IT'S A BENEFIT OR A DETRIMENT AT THE PRESENT TO AN EMPTY COMMITTEE BUT. THINK THEY'RE YOU KNOW GET ALWAYS. LOTS OF GOOD QUESTIONS SMALLER THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD SOUNDS LIKE THERE ARE SOME VERY SPECIFIC CONCERNS THAT MIGHT BE AN AVENUE. TO ADDRESS FROM THIS COMMITTEE STANDPOINT THOUGH. SOMEONE WHO'S GONE THROUGH TRAUMATIC SITUATION. NEEDING A BIT OF TIME BIT OF ENERGY AND A BIT OF SUPPORT SEEMS TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING ABOUT. OKAY AND I AM THAT IS THE MOTION I'M GOING TO SECOND THAT. IS WE HAVE SUCH A A LACK OF MEMBERS. HAVE A FEELING THIS BILL IS GOING TO GO ON CALL THAT THE BUDGET MYKOLA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES JUST WANNA QUICKLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE POINTS THE OPPOSITION AND FIRST THANK THEM FOR FOR THEIR OPEN MINDEDNESS AND AND THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO FIND PLACES WHERE WE CAN. OUT WORK TOGETHER WHENEVER POSSIBLE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT I VOICE SAID AND IT CONTINUES TO BE MY INTENT TO ADDRESS THROUGH LANGUAGE PER. PERHAPS FOR THE NEXT COMMITTEE IS TO ADDRESS AN EMPLOYER'S DUTY TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT IF INTERFERE WITH THAT WE DON'T WANT OUR BILL TAT. BECOME AN OBSTACLE FOR A A BONA FIDE GOOD FAITH INVESTIGATION SO WE'RE WE'RE GONNA WORK ON LANGUAGE TO TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE I SAID THAT THE PRIOR COMMITTEE. I SITTING IN HERE IT CONTINUES TO BE OUR COMMITMENT AND WERE WORKING OUT WE WILL WORK ON LANGUAGE TOGETHER. ON THE ISSUE OF DOCUMENTATION ARE WE CONSIDER THAT A A STRONG SAFEGUARDS IN IN THE BILL TO HAVE EITHER A. POLICE REPORT OR AT A COURT DOCUMENT OR A DOCTOR OR A CANCERS NOTE. THAT IS A IT IS OUR INTENT THAT APPLY FOR FOR ANYONE SEEKING RELIEF SO TO THE EXTENT THERE'S LACK OF CLARITY. IN THE BILL AS RELATED TO A SECONDARY EMPLOYER OR FAMILY MEMBER I WILL WORK TO ADDRESS THAT SET TO PROVIDE THAT NECESSARY CLARITY AND FINALLY AT THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY. WE THINK IT'S A GOOD DEFINITION WE THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THOSE AND INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION CHILDREN PARENTS SPOUSES OR DOMESTIC PARTNERS GRANDPARENTS. SIBLINGS THEY ARE ALL ON DEPENDING ON THE FAMILY WERE TALKING OFTEN ABOUT A NONTRADITIONAL FAMILIES IMMIGRANT FAMILIES LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THERE THERE ARE CRITICAL SUPPORT ROLES FREE TO THOSE MEMBERS OF A FAMILY THAT CAN REALLY HELP SOMEONE WHEN THEY'RE A VICTIM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT SO. A WHAT WEEK WE THINK THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE DEFINITION WITH THAT I THINK YOU FAIR THE CONSIDERATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABOUT. THANK YOU.

HE WAS FLUENT IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. IF WE APPLY THE INTERPRETER EXCEPTION HERE THE BUSINESS IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A WRITTEN TRANSLATION OF THE CONTACT IS THE INTERPRETER IS AN ADULT FLUENT IN BOTH LANGUAGES. I MEAN NOTHING IN EXAMPLE THREE GETS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED. A BUYER NEGOTIATES IN SPANISH A CAR PURCHASE DUTIES SIXTEEN YEAR OLD SIGN OBVIOUSLY A MINOR HE WAS FLUENT IN BOTH LANGUAGES. BECAUSE THE NEGOTIATION BECAUSE THE NEGOTIATOR AND NOT PLEASE IS A MINOR INTERPRETER EXCEPTION DOES NOT APPLY. IN MOST STAKEHOLDERS ARE IN AGREEMENT. BUT THE BUYER IN THAT CASE WE DESERVE A WRITTEN TRANSLATION IN THIS EXAMPLE. BUT NOT LEAST STANDING ITS BASIC LOGIC A RECENT APPEALS COURT HELD THAT THEY IN IT AT FAX PATTERNS SIMILAR TO WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED. THE BUSINESS WAS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE IS TRANSLATED CONTACT TO THE BUYER. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. BECAUSE THE RULING IN THAT CASE SEVERELY WEEKENDER CALIFORNIA TRANSLATION ACTS. AB TWENTY SEVEN AWAY CLARIFIES THE LOTS DEVOID STATES. MISINTERPRETATION. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS COMMITTED TO USING EVERY TOOL AVAILABLE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS WHETHER THAT THEIR ONGOING ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATORY AUTHORITY. OR THROUGH SUPPORTING AND SPONSORING STRONG LEGISLATION FETCHES AB TWENTY SEVEN NOW A. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY MY COLLEAGUE MICHELLE THAN GALLAGHER AND AS SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DID CONSUMER LAW SECTION. TO MAKE A SHORT STATEMENT AND ALSO TO HELP OUT WITH ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME I WILL BE BRIEF. THE CONSUMER LAW SECTION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE FOCUSES AND HAS ALWAYS FOCUSED ON PROTECTING VULNERABLE CONSUMERS FROM SHARP BUSINESS PRACTICES. IMMIGRANT CONSUMERS ARE JUST SUCH A GROUP CIVIL CODE SECTION SIXTEEN THIRTY TWO AND SIXTEEN THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE WHICH WOULD BE AMENDED HERE. ARE IMPORTANT TOOLS IN PREVENTING NON ENGLISH SPEAKING CONSUMERS FROM BEING THE VICTIMS OF FRAUD. OR MISUNDERSTANDING OR MISTAKES WHEN THEY ENTER INTO CERTAIN. IMPORTANT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. SOMETIMES A NON ENGLISH SPEAKING CONSUMER COMMUNICATES WITH THE SELLER BY RELYING ON A CHILD AS AN INTERPRETER. WHEN THE CHILD HAS TO SHOULDER THAT ADULT BURDEN. AND THE PARENTS ARE DEPRIVED OF A TRANSLATED COPY OF THE CONTRACT IT'S UNFAIR THERE'S NO TRANSPARENCY. AND THE POTENTIAL FOR MISUNDERSTANDING AND ABUSE AND EVEN LITIGATION INCREASES IN THIS SITUATION THE A TRANSLATION ENSURES THAT ALL OF THE ADULTS IN THE ROOM UNDERSTAND THE DEAL'S TERMS. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS DEBORAH CARLTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION BUT ME FIRST CLARIFY. WE HAVE NO PROBLEMS CLARIFYING THE STATUTE WE HAVE NO PROBLEMS ARE REVERSING THE NARROW HOLDING UP IN THE LOPEZ CASE. I THINK THOUGH WE HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT HOW THE CURRENT STATUTE IS WRITTEN WE HAVE A. WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S WHEN THE BUSINESS NEGOTIATES IN THE LANGUAGE NOT WHEN THE CONSUMER NEGOTIATES IN THE LANGUAGE. SO WE HAVE THIS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME IN THE RENTAL HOUSING INDUSTRY. PARENTS COME. TO RENT AN APARTMENT THEY BRING THEIR CHILD WITH THEM. UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THE WAY THIS BILL IS READING THE AMENDMENT LANGUAGE AS WRITTEN. THE LANDLORD WILL NOW SAY I CAN'T TALK TO YOU BECAUSE I'M GONNA HAVE TO PROVIDE MY CONTRACTS. IN RUSSIAN OR IN YOU KNOW CHINESE OR TAGALOG. BECAUSE I'M SPEAKING WITH YOU. THROUGH YOUR TRANSLATOR WHO HAPPENS TO BE A MINOR. WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE. PROBLEMS WITH GETTING PEOPLE INTO HOUSING TODAY. I THINK I THINK WE CAN WORK WITH YOU TO PROVIDE CLARITY AND WE PROVIDED SOME LANGUAGE. TO SAY THAT NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE INTERPRETED TO REQUIRE THE PERSON ENGAGED IN THE TRAITOR BUSINESS. I TO PROVIDE A TRANSLATION THE CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH THE OTHER PARTY COMMUNICATED. THROUGH HIS OR HER INTERPRET IT INTERPRETER AND THEN OF COURSE NOTHING IS REQUIRED. FOR THE LAMB OR TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF AN INTERPRETER WAS UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. SO I THINK WE CAN CARP WHICH BOTH THINGS IF WE HAVE THE CLARIFICATION WERE ASKING FOR. ALONGSIDE THE LANGUAGE. THAT HAS BEEN. ALREADY PROVIDED IN THE BILL. SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU TO US EITHER VOTE NO OR HELP US PROVIDE SOME LANGUAGE THAT MAKES THIS BILL MORE CLEAR. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN DORY ABOUT THE CIVIL DISASSOCIATION I WILL ECHO THAT WE ARE.
