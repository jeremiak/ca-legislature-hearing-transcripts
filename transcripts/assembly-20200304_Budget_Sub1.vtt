00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:36.313
WITH THE LAND SHERMAN ACT IN

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.949
ITS CURRENT FORM. OR DOES THE

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:41.051
LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION

00:48:41.118 --> 00:48:41.685
WANT TO CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:44.488
PATH. IN THIS CASE WE RECOMMEND

00:48:44.554 --> 00:48:45.522
THAT THE LEGISLATURE BEGIN TO

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:47.190

WITHIN AVAILABLE RESOURCES. IN

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.431
LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THE

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:56.199
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PROPOSING

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:57.968
TO IMPLEMENT THE RATE STUDY IT

00:48:58.035 --> 00:48:59.269
APPEARS TO BE CONSIDERING SUCH

00:48:59.336 --> 00:49:01.171
AN ALTERNATIVE PATH. YOU

00:49:01.238 --> 00:49:02.239

PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU TODAY WE

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:05.542
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:07.144
KEEP THIS KEY DECISION POINT IN

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:11.048
MIND. WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT

00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:11.615
THESE WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT

00:49:11.682 --> 00:49:13.550
DECISIONS- I CAN'T UNDERSCORE

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:16.453

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.128
FOR TODAY HOWEVER IS THAT THE

00:49:25.195 --> 00:49:27.297

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:28.057
WAGE. I NEEDLESS TO SAY WERE

01:10:28.123 --> 01:10:30.159
LOSING THE BATTLE IN COMPETING

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:33.796
FOR WORKERS LAST YEAR WE LOST

01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:35.598
NINETY THREE WORKERS OUT OF A

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:37.566
HUNDRED NINETY POSITIONS SO

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:40.069
REALLY CRITICAL ISSUE FOR US.

01:10:40.135 --> 01:10:41.604
THANKS HIGH HARY BRAWL WITH PAT%

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.539
POINT- THE STATE CURRENTLY USES

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:45.107
TWO WAYS TO DETERMINE HOW TO

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:46.842
ADJUST RATES WHEN MINUTES STATE

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:49.044
MINIMUM WAGE GOES UP FOR OUR

01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:50.579
COMMUNICATOR FACILITIES THERE'S

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:52.615
<u>N AUTOMATIC INCREASE BETWEEN</u>

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:53.916
FOUR AND 5% FOR EVERYTHING

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:55.918
ELSE. IT'S A LABORIOUS PROCESS

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:58.988
pINDIVIDUAL STAFF MEMBERS WHO

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:00.356
EARN LESS THAN THE NEW MINIMUM

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:02.358
WAGE COMPILING ALL THAT DATA

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:03.626
CHURNING IT OUT AND COMING UP

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:05.394
WITH NEW INDIVIDUAL RATES FOR

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:07.262
EACH. PROGRAM SO BESIDES THIS

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:09.331
ADMINISTRATIVE HEAVY PROCESS IT

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:10.766
HAS A SEPARATE ISSUE WHICH IS

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:12.835
THAT IN AREAS WHERE WE CAN'T

01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:14.770
PAY MINIMUM WAGE. IT'S NOT

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:16.438

THAT WE CAN'T PAY WE PAY A

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:23.112
DOLLAR A DOLLAR FIFTY MORE THAN

01:11:23.178 --> 01:11:24.446
MINIMUM WAGE MINIMUM WAGE GOES

01:11:24.513 --> 01:11:26.248
UP AT THE STATE LEVEL WE HAVE

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:27.116
TO INCREASE OUR RATES. THERE'S

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:28.784
NO SUPPORT SO WE HAVE AS A

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:30.953
BACKWARD SYSTEM WHERE LOW COST

ISSUES DISCUSSED IN THIS IN

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:37.005
THIS SECTION OF THE HEARING SO

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:38.841
I'D LIKE TO JUST A COMMENT ON

01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:41.643
FOUR DIFFERENT POINTS FIRST WE

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:43.045
I JUST WANT TO RECAP SOME OF

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:44.079
THE COMMENTS WE HAD MADE ABOUT

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:45.414
THE RATE STUDY ONE THAT THIS

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.915
WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE.

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:49.084
SORT OF A QUANTIFIABLE MEASURE

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:49.785
OF THE FUNDING GAP IN THE

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:52.955
SYSTEM. TO THAT THE RATE STUDY

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:55.557
WAS A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY. AND

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:57.326
THREE THAT THE- THIS IS THE

01:14:57.392 --> 01:14:58.026
SECOND BUDGET THAT THE

01:14:58.093 --> 01:14:59.661
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PROPOSING

01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:00.696
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:02.831
STUDY. THE SECOND POINT THAT

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:04.833
I'D LIKE TO MAKE TODAY IS THAT

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.902
OUR OFFICE RECOMMENDS APPROVAL

01:15:06.969 --> 01:15:09.171
OF FUNDING FOR THE THREE- FOR

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:10.439
THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATES FOR

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:12.641
THREE ADDITIONAL SERVICES- THIS

01:15:12.708 --> 01:15:14.142
REFLECTS LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:16.144
THAT WERE TAKEN LAST YEAR TO

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:16.912
APPROVE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:19.381
INCREASES. I WOULD NOTE THAT

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:21.216
OUR OFFICE STILL HAS CONCERNS

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:22.517
HOWEVER ABOUT THE FACT THAT

01:15:22.584 --> 01:15:24.419
THESE ARE ONGOING SERVICES

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:26.455
SUBJECT TO A SUSPENSION- EVEN

01:15:26.521 --> 01:15:28.390
THOUGH THAT SUSPENSION HAS BEEN

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:30.959
DELAYED BY EIGHTEEN MONTHS.

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.761
THIRD SOME COMMENTS ON THE

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:34.663
MINIMUM WAGE THE MINIMUM WAGE

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:38.033
HAS REALLY- CREATED A NUMBER OF

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:40.135
DIFFERENT CHALLENGES FOR THE

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.003
SYSTEM. ONE IS THE ISSUE OF

01:15:41.069 --> 01:15:42.938
COMPACTION AND THAT'S LIKELY

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:44.840
AFFECTING OTHER SERVICES

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:46.942
ELSEWHERE TOO. IN OTHER

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:51.680
PROGRAMS. BUT A UNIQUE THE-

01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:53.115
ISSUE THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED

01:15:53.181 --> 01:15:54.783
ALREADY IS THIS THIS CORK IN

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:55.918
LOST SO NOT ONLY DO THE

01:15:55.984 --> 01:15:57.185
PROVIDERS IN THE HIGH COST

01:15:57.252 --> 01:16:00.455
AREAS NOT ONLY ARE THEY UNABLE

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:02.758
TO GET A RATE ADJUSTMENT. TO

01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:03.926
HELP COVER THE COSTS OF THE

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:05.727
LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE ORDINANCES

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:07.829
THEY ALSO ARE INELIGIBLE TO

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:09.765
REQUEST FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:14.770
STATE MINIMUM WAGES. THERE ARE

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:16.405
A COUPLE OPTIONS TO ADDRESS

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:18.507
THIS- WHAT WE DUBBED THE CORK

01:16:18.573 --> 01:16:22.010
IN LAW- WHAT ONE WOULD BE TO-

01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:23.578
SIMPLY DO SOME STATUTORY CLEAN

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:25.714
UP TO ALLOW THOSE PROVIDERS TO

01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:27.983
ACCESS THE CURRENT ADJUSTMENTS

01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:30.018
UNDER THE CURRENT PROCESS THE

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:31.520
SECOND WOULD BE A PROPOSAL

01:16:31.586 --> 01:16:32.854
ALONG THE LINES OF MISTER

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.856
FRASIER'S AND MR HOLDINGS AND

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:37.292
THE ASSOCIATED ADVOCATES- WELL

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:38.527
OUR OFFICES NOT CONDUCTED AN

01:16:38.593 --> 01:16:39.695
INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:42.998
WHETHER THREE POINT 3% IS- AT

01:16:43.065 --> 01:16:44.633
THE RIGHT AMOUNT WE HAVE TAKEN

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.835
A LOOK AT THEIR OVERALL- COST

01:16:46.902 --> 01:16:48.503
ESTIMATE WHICH IS WHICH SEEMS

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:50.205
ABOUT IN LINE WITH WHAT WE

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:51.606
WOULD HAVE CALCULATED. A AND

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:53.575
THEN FINALLY ONE OF THE POINTS

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:55.344
THAT WAS RAISED IN THE AGENDA

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:56.845
THAT WE DIDN'T TALK A LOT

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:58.613
ABOUT- BUT I'LL JUST MENTION IT

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.615
BRIEFLY IS THE FACT THAT THE

01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:02.384
SYSTEM DOESN'T HAVE A-

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:05.287
SYSTEMATIC WAY OF COLLECTING

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:07.956
DATA. ABOUT CONSUMERS IN ABOUT

01:17:08.023 --> 01:17:10.425
SERVICES- THIS MAKES IT VERY

01:17:10.492 --> 01:17:11.193
DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT THE

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:13.628
UNMET SERVICE REQUIREMENTS ARE

01:17:13.695 --> 01:17:15.731
WE DON'T KNOW IF CONSUMERS HAVE

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:17.566
THE CHOICES- OF SERVICE

01:17:17.632 --> 01:17:19.568
PROVIDERS THAT THEY'D LIKE. A

01:17:19.634 --> 01:17:20.202
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:23.105
QUALITY. AND WE DON'T KNOW IF

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:24.139
THINGS ARE BEING DONE

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:25.841
CONSISTENTLY ACROSS REGIONAL

01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:26.875
CENTERS WHETHER THEY'RE

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:28.110
COLLECTING DATA IN THE SAME

01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:30.479
WAY- EVEN CONSIDERING SERVICE

01:17:30.545 --> 01:17:32.214
CODES IN THE SAME WAY. THANK

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.149
YOU I THINK YOU HIT THE NAIL ON

02:03:40.846 --> 02:03:42.248
THE SAME INFORMATION IF THEY GO

02:03:42.314 --> 02:03:43.582
FROM ONE REGIONAL CENTER TO THE

02:03:43.649 --> 02:03:45.584
NEXT REGIONAL CENTER. SO THESE

02:03:45.651 --> 02:03:47.253
INFORMATION PACKETS IF YOU WILL

02:03:47.319 --> 02:03:48.921
REALLY DO TO CUT A TOUCH ON

02:03:48.988 --> 02:03:51.190
THAT MAKING SURE THAT EVER GOES

02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:52.625
THROUGH THAT FRONT DOOR. IS

02:03:52.691 --> 02:03:54.059
GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE

SAME INFORMATION AND THE

02:03:55.027 --> 02:03:58.397
CONTINUITY. THEN TOOK A- STEP

02:03:58.464 --> 02:03:59.932
IS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON.

02:03:59.999 --> 02:04:02.334
A REAL TIME SURVEY. I COULD

02:04:02.401 --> 02:04:04.737
DELIVER TO DO THE FAMILIES THAT

ARE GOING THROUGH AND TAKE THAT

02:04:07.072 --> 02:04:08.407
CAN GO AHEAD AND IN REAL TIME

02:04:08.474 --> 02:04:11.977
NBA. TO INDICATE IN SAY FIVE TO

02:04:12.044 --> 02:04:14.180
EIGHT DIFFERENT QUESTIONS WHAT

02:04:14.246 --> 02:04:17.683

02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:18.317
QUESTIONS ANSWERED. OUTSTANDING

02:04:18.384 --> 02:04:19.084
QUESTION DO YOU UNDER THE

OUTCOME IN YOUR- ABILITY- SO

02:04:21.554 --> 02:04:22.888
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE

02:04:22.955 --> 02:04:23.856
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE

02:04:23.923 --> 02:04:25.491
DEFINITELY LINKED WE'VE BEEN

02:04:25.558 --> 02:04:27.593
VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO

PROCESS BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS-

02:04:30.563 --> 02:04:32.998
THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO. SECURE

02:04:33.065 --> 02:04:35.267
THE SUCCESS OF THIS CONCEPT. SO

02:04:35.334 --> 02:04:37.036
A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT

02:04:37.102 --> 02:04:37.636
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT IN THIS

02:04:37.703 --> 02:04:40.472
PROGRAM. IS WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE

02:04:40.539 --> 02:04:41.941

LATER YOU IS ONE TO FOUR. FIVE

02:05:00.092 --> 02:05:05.064
BUT WE- NEED TO DECIDE SAID

02:05:05.130 --> 02:05:09.335
EARLIER WE HAVE A- DIFFERENT.

02:05:09.401 --> 02:05:11.503
SO YOU MIGHT THAT EXPERTISE TO

02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:13.606
NAVIGATE THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS.

02:05:13.672 --> 02:05:15.641
SO AGAIN TO KIND OF. TAKE YOU

THAT WE'VE HAD PARTICULARLY FOR

02:05:20.779 --> 02:05:22.748
OUR YOUNGER FAMILIES. IS THAT

02:05:22.815 --> 02:05:24.183
OVER THE MANY YEARS THE LAST

02:05:24.250 --> 02:05:26.352
SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE SHIFTED

02:05:26.418 --> 02:05:28.087
ABA SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS

02:05:28.153 --> 02:05:31.690
WITH AUTISM TOO MANY CAL OR TO

02:05:31.757 --> 02:05:34.059
THEIR HEALTH PLANS IT IS NOT AN

02:05:34.126 --> 02:05:36.395
EASY SYSTEM TO NAVIGATE SO WHEN

02:05:36.462 --> 02:05:38.063
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR DO YOU

02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:39.565
HAVE EXPERTISE. FOR THIS COURT

02:05:39.632 --> 02:05:42.635
ERRORS THAT HAVE EXPERTISE TO-

02:05:42.701 --> 02:05:44.403
WORK AND HELP AND SUPPORT IN

02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:46.272

02:05:53.412 --> 02:05:56.916
THOSE CHEN SOURCES OF DEPEND ON

02:05:56.982 --> 02:05:58.951
AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT PERSON

02:05:59.018 --> 02:06:02.321
IS HURRY THE CONCEPT IS THAT

02:06:02.388 --> 02:06:04.323
MAKE SURE WE HAVE A BASE FUND.

02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:07.226
THERE WERE ALSO WOULD. THERE'S

02:06:07.293 --> 02:06:08.460
JEEZ EIGHT NAY TO MOVE. AND HOW

02:06:08.527 --> 02:06:09.428
THEY'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT

02:06:09.495 --> 02:06:12.364
PRESCRIBE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

02:06:12.431 --> 02:06:14.800
AND THEIR STRATEGY DEPENDING ON

02:06:14.867 --> 02:06:17.937
THE RESULTS OF. RED COAST

02:06:18.003 --> 02:06:19.405

PAGE ON YOU HAVE ABOUT FOUR

02:06:27.346 --> 02:06:34.186
THOUSAND AND- OR. TO IN OUR

02:06:34.253 --> 02:06:35.854
CASE LOAD SO WE COULD APPROACH

02:06:35.921 --> 02:06:37.723
CASELOADS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY

02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:39.224
AND RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENCE OF

02:06:39.291 --> 02:06:40.526
THE NEEDS OF THE PERSONS THAT

02:06:40.592 --> 02:06:42.461
THEY'RE SERVING. SO THIS WOULD

02:06:42.528 --> 02:06:43.963
GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

02:06:44.029 --> 02:06:45.397
REGIONAL CENTERS TO MOVE

02:06:45.464 --> 02:06:47.466
FORWARD IN A WAY THAT ALSO

02:06:47.533 --> 02:06:48.701
WOULD STILL BE H. CBS

02:06:48.767 --> 02:06:50.769
COMPLAINTS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING

IS THE EXPERIENCE IN THOSE AT

02:06:56.208 --> 02:06:59.445
ARMS SO THOSE ARE THE ELEMENTS

02:06:59.511 --> 02:07:03.382
THAT WE SEE NO OVER THE NEXT.

02:07:03.449 --> 02:07:06.752

AND THEN THOSE PER- PERFORMANCE

02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:17.062
MEASURES THAT WE WOULD BE USING

02:07:17.129 --> 02:07:19.131
TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THOSE

02:07:19.198 --> 02:07:19.965

02:09:07.873 --> 02:09:09.541
ABOUT THE FUTURE VISION OF THE

02:09:09.608 --> 02:09:10.843
SYSTEM AS WE TALKED ABOUT

02:09:10.909 --> 02:09:14.746
SEVERAL ISSUES AGO. THE REASON

02:09:14.813 --> 02:09:16.148
WE RECOMMEND REJECTION IS NOT

02:09:16.215 --> 02:09:18.350
BECAUSE THE IDEA DOESN'T HAVE

02:09:18.417 --> 02:09:21.019
MERIT BUT WE FEEL THAT RIGHT

02:09:21.086 --> 02:09:23.689
NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO BE

02:09:23.755 --> 02:09:25.390
THINKING ABOUT INCENTIVE

02:09:25.457 --> 02:09:27.259
PAYMENTS- IN LIGHT OF THE

02:09:27.326 --> 02:09:28.961
SIGNIFICANT FUND UP THAT WE

02:09:29.027 --> 02:09:32.064
JUST DISCUSSED I'M IT ALSO

02:09:32.131 --> 02:09:33.532
MEANS THAT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS

02:09:33.599 --> 02:09:36.435
MADE THAT. WE NOT RATE QUESTION

02:09:36.502 --> 02:09:39.438
AT THIS PIVOTAL MOMENT- AND

02:09:39.505 --> 02:09:39.972
THAT INSTEAD TALKING ABOUT

02:09:40.038 --> 02:09:42.908
FISCAL REFORM A IT MAY BE THE

02:09:42.975 --> 02:09:45.777
TOP PRIORITY AT THIS TIME

02:09:45.844 --> 02:09:47.679
HOWEVER WE ALSO DON'T THINK

02:09:47.746 --> 02:09:50.015
THERE SHOULD BE A FALSE CHOICE

02:09:50.082 --> 02:09:53.552
BETWEEN TALKING ABOUT QUALITY

02:09:53.619 --> 02:09:54.753
WE TALKING ABOUT QUALITY OR

02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:56.755
OPENLY TALKING ABOUT FISCAL

02:09:56.822 --> 02:09:58.924
REFORM. THERE REALLY TWO

02:09:58.991 --> 02:10:00.792
DIFFERENT DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU

02:10:00.859 --> 02:10:02.794
CAN HAVE ONE IS ABOUT QUALITY

02:10:02.861 --> 02:10:03.929
AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND

02:10:03.996 --> 02:10:06.131
TRANSPARENCY. AND ANOTHER IS

02:10:06.198 --> 02:10:10.402
ABOUT USING INCENTIVES TO TRY

02:10:10.469 --> 02:10:11.003
TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS THAT'S

02:10:11.069 --> 02:10:12.337
JUST ONE WAY TO TRY TO ACHIEVE

02:10:12.404 --> 02:10:14.106
QUALITY IN THE SYSTEM INCENTIVE

02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:16.575
PAYMENTS YOU CAN STILL. TRY TO

02:10:16.642 --> 02:10:18.076
ACHIEVE QUALITY WITHOUT

02:10:18.143 --> 02:10:22.147
INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. I'M SO IN

02:10:22.214 --> 02:10:23.215
FACT I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A

02:10:23.282 --> 02:10:25.784
COUPLE OF EXAMPLES FOR HOW YOU

02:10:25.851 --> 02:10:27.019
MIGHT PURSUE QUALITY AND

02:10:27.085 --> 02:10:28.687
ACCOUNTABILITY GOALS IN OTHER

02:10:28.754 --> 02:10:31.123
WAYS RIGHT NOW. ONE IS BETTER

02:10:31.190 --> 02:10:33.959
OVERSIGHT OF THE SYSTEM AND IN

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:36.562
A COLLABORATIVE WAY- IRAN TO

02:10:36.628 --> 02:10:38.463
FACILITATE CONTINUOUS

02:10:38.530 --> 02:10:40.132
IMPROVEMENT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE

02:10:40.199 --> 02:10:43.769
SYSTEM. ANOTHER IS TO REVISE

02:10:43.835 --> 02:10:45.103
THE REGIONAL CENTER PERFORMANCE

02:10:45.170 --> 02:10:46.471
CONTRACTS WHICH IS PART OF THE

02:10:46.538 --> 02:10:47.973
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WE

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:50.008
RECOMMEND APPROVING THAT ASPECT

02:10:50.075 --> 02:10:52.578
OF THE PROPOSAL. ANOTHER

02:10:52.644 --> 02:10:54.513
POSSIBILITY IS TO RESTRUCTURE

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:55.480
SOME OF THE CURRENT

02:10:55.547 --> 02:10:56.982
APPROPRIATIONS THAT CURRENTLY

02:10:57.049 --> 02:10:58.717
EXIST IN THE SYSTEM SO FOR

02:10:58.784 --> 02:11:00.986
EXAMPLE. THE DEPARTMENT

02:11:01.053 --> 02:11:01.954
CURRENTLY HAS AN INCENTIVE

02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:04.723
PROGRAM- THAT THE THAT THE IN

02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:07.426
THE SYSTEM FOR A COMPETITIVE

02:11:07.492 --> 02:11:09.995
INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. HOWEVER

02:11:10.062 --> 02:11:12.297
THAT PROGRAM HAS NOT. REALLY

02:11:12.364 --> 02:11:13.865
TAKEN OFF THE WAY I THINK

02:11:13.932 --> 02:11:15.734
EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE IT TO YOU.

02:11:15.801 --> 02:11:17.002
IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO

02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:18.737
RESTRUCTURE THAT PROGRAM AND

02:11:18.804 --> 02:11:20.572
ALMOST USE IT AS A PILOT TEST

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.441
OF INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO

02:11:22.507 --> 02:11:25.777
IMPROVE QUALITY. I'M YOU COULD

02:11:25.844 --> 02:11:26.945
CONSIDER DOING ANOTHER TYPE OF

02:11:27.012 --> 02:11:28.146
PILOT TEST OF INCENTIVE

02:11:28.213 --> 02:11:30.249
PAYMENTS RATHER THAN APPROVING

02:11:30.315 --> 02:11:32.484
A OF A SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION TO

02:11:32.551 --> 02:11:35.053
DO THIS- ON A NON PILOT TEST

02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:39.958
BASIS. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT

02:11:40.025 --> 02:11:41.727
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT MANY IN THE

02:11:41.793 --> 02:11:43.061
FORM OF INCENTIVE PAYMENTS WILL

02:11:43.128 --> 02:11:44.963
BE THE PRIMARY MOTIVATOR FOR

02:11:45.030 --> 02:11:47.666
MANY REGIONAL CENTER AND

02:11:47.733 --> 02:11:50.102
SERVICE PROVIDER EMPLOYEES.

02:11:50.168 --> 02:11:50.669
THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS TO

02:11:50.736 --> 02:11:53.639
IMPROVE QUALITY. SUIT TO

02:11:53.705 --> 02:11:55.807
IMPROVE THE QUALITY WORK OF

02:11:55.874 --> 02:11:58.844
THOSE INDIVIDUALS- WITHOUT. AT

02:11:58.910 --> 02:12:00.912
USING INCENTIVE PAYMENTS WE

02:12:00.979 --> 02:12:03.548
HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF FOLKS

02:12:03.615 --> 02:12:06.551
DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT THAT.

02:12:06.618 --> 02:12:09.087
YOU JUST. MAKING A DECENT WAGE

02:12:09.154 --> 02:12:10.589
FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT BE ONE WAY TO

02:12:10.656 --> 02:12:14.393
IMPROVE QUALITY. SO I WOULD

02:12:14.459 --> 02:12:15.927
ALSO MENTION THAT FROM OUR

02:12:15.994 --> 02:12:18.297
OFFICES INITIAL REVIEW OF THE

02:12:18.363 --> 02:12:20.399
LITERATURE APPEARS MIXED ON

02:12:20.465 --> 02:12:22.234
WHETHER PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE

02:12:22.301 --> 02:12:23.902
PROGRAMS IN THE PUBLIC CONTEXT

02:12:23.969 --> 02:12:26.371
ARE ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL THERE ARE

02:12:26.438 --> 02:12:27.372
MANY WAYS THAT THEY CAN GO

02:12:27.439 --> 02:12:30.275
WRONG. AND THE DESIGN OF THE

02:12:30.342 --> 02:12:30.776
PROGRAM IS REALLY REALLY

02:12:30.842 --> 02:12:35.614
IMPORTANT. FINALLY I WOULD NOTE

02:12:35.681 --> 02:12:37.382
THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY NOT TOO

02:12:37.449 --> 02:12:39.551
MUCH DETAIL ABOUT THE ACTUAL

02:12:39.618 --> 02:12:41.453
PROPOSAL THAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:43.388
HAS PUT FORWARD AND TO AVOID

02:12:43.455 --> 02:12:46.058
POTENTIAL PITFALLS THE DESIGN

02:12:46.124 --> 02:12:47.492
AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE

02:12:47.559 --> 02:12:49.695
CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS TO THE

02:12:49.761 --> 02:12:51.196
TO THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM

02:12:51.263 --> 02:12:52.898
WILL BE PARAMOUNT AND THE

02:12:52.964 --> 02:12:56.201
LEGISLATURE TO TIED TO PROCEED

02:12:56.268 --> 02:12:57.736
AND APPROVED THIS PROPOSAL WE

02:12:57.803 --> 02:12:59.638
WRECKED THEY REQUIRE MORE

02:12:59.705 --> 02:13:00.339
DETAIL THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT

02:13:00.405 --> 02:13:02.908
ENVISIONS THE PRO I'M ACTUALLY

02:13:02.974 --> 02:13:05.344
WORKING ABOUT THE PLAN FOR

02:13:05.410 --> 02:13:08.080
IMPLEMENTATION AND ABOUT HALF

02:13:08.146 --> 02:13:08.680
BUT APART. WELL YOU A PROBLEM

02:13:08.747 --> 02:13:11.683
IN SO MAKE PREVENTS ON LIVE

02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:15.320
BASIS. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL

02:13:15.387 --> 02:13:19.358
HILL HERE FROM KATIE HORNBERGER.

02:13:19.424 --> 02:13:21.393
HI THANK YOU UP SO I'M GETTING

02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:22.861
REFER BURGER FROM DISABILITY

02:13:22.928 --> 02:13:24.029
RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND THE

02:13:24.096 --> 02:13:25.097
DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF

02:13:25.163 --> 02:13:26.765
CLIENTS RATES ADVOCACY AND WE

02:13:26.832 --> 02:13:28.400
PROVIDE SERVICES TO REGIONAL

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:29.835
CENTER CLIENTS THROUGH A

02:13:29.901 --> 02:13:31.436
CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT.

02:13:31.503 --> 02:13:36.241
AND OF YOUR WE ACTUALLY- OR-

02:13:36.308 --> 02:13:37.843
REALLY SORT OF BELIEVE THAT

02:13:37.909 --> 02:13:38.810
THERE ARE A LOT OF POSITIVE

02:13:38.877 --> 02:13:41.046
ASPECTS TO THE PERFORMANCE

02:13:41.113 --> 02:13:44.416
INCENTIVE PLAN AND- BUT WE ALL

02:13:44.483 --> 02:13:45.250
SORT OF KNOW THE DEVIL'S IN THE

02:13:45.317 --> 02:13:47.586
DETAILS AND DOES SO AND YOU

02:13:47.652 --> 02:13:49.287
SAID NOT A LOT OF DETAILS TO

02:13:49.354 --> 02:13:51.857
DATE. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO

02:13:51.923 --> 02:13:52.591
REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT THOSE

02:13:52.657 --> 02:13:54.860
DETAILS MIGHT BE AND I THINK

02:13:54.926 --> 02:13:57.262
SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:13:57.329 --> 02:13:59.030
THINGS ON IT REALLY WANT OF

02:13:59.097 --> 02:14:01.566
ROPE STE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE

02:14:01.633 --> 02:14:03.635
PROGRAM FOR THE RICH CENTERS WE

02:14:03.702 --> 02:14:05.937
NEED TO THINK ABOUT FIRST THAT

02:14:06.004 --> 02:14:10.208
THERE ARE SO. SYSTEM I PREFER

02:14:10.275 --> 02:14:12.210
COMMENCEMENT THAT UP TO THE

02:14:12.277 --> 02:14:13.612
REGION CENTERS AND THERE'S

02:14:13.678 --> 02:14:15.781
DEPENDING ON MEASURE OF PROGRAM

02:14:15.847 --> 02:14:18.884
CAN'T BE. IT WOULD HAVE TO ALL

02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:20.051
TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS

02:14:20.118 --> 02:14:23.088
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE THAT THAT

02:14:23.155 --> 02:14:24.289
ALL PARTICIPATE. ON THEY WOULD

02:14:24.356 --> 02:14:25.357
HAVE TO BE HAVE PERFORMANCE

02:14:25.424 --> 02:14:27.159
TARGETS ARE MEASURE. THEY WOULD

02:14:27.225 --> 02:14:29.394
HAVE TO MOVE OUR SYSTEM FORWARD

02:14:29.461 --> 02:14:30.429
AND NOT AND THEY WOULD ALSO

02:14:30.495 --> 02:14:32.864
HAVE TO BE TRANSPARENT- I THINK

02:14:32.931 --> 02:14:33.799
WE'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF TIMES

02:14:33.865 --> 02:14:35.434
TODAY THAT ONE OF THE

02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:37.235
DIFFICULTIES IN OUR SYSTEM AND

02:14:37.302 --> 02:14:38.870
ONE THAT I WOULD AGREE WITH

02:14:38.937 --> 02:14:39.604
THIS THAT WE OFTEN. THE

02:14:39.671 --> 02:14:41.339
TRANSPARENCY IS LACKING IN IT'S

02:14:41.406 --> 02:14:42.574
HARD SEE WHERE WE'VE MADE

02:14:42.641 --> 02:14:44.810
IMPROVEMENTS. WE SHOULD BE ABLE

02:14:44.876 --> 02:14:46.011
TO REALLY READ THESE HAVE A

02:14:46.077 --> 02:14:49.080
COMMON UNDERSTANDING- WHEN I

02:14:49.147 --> 02:14:50.549
READ IT I SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S

02:14:50.615 --> 02:14:52.684
EXPECTED OF MY REGIONAL CENTER.

02:14:52.751 --> 02:14:56.988
UP WE ALSO. HAVE AS NANCY SAID

02:14:57.055 --> 02:14:58.657
THAT THE EXACT MEASUREMENT

02:14:58.723 --> 02:15:00.258
SHOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM ONE

02:15:00.325 --> 02:15:01.760
CENTER TO THE NEXT BECAUSE WE

02:15:01.827 --> 02:15:03.428
DON'T WANT ONE CENTER TO COME

02:15:03.495 --> 02:15:04.996
IN ALREADY MEETING THE GOAL.

02:15:05.063 --> 02:15:06.531
AND ANOTHER REALLY HAVE IT BE

02:15:06.598 --> 02:15:08.333
AN UNATTAINABLE GOAL. SO THE

02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:09.501
EXACT MEASURE WOULD BE

02:15:09.568 --> 02:15:11.169
DIFFERENT WITH DIFFERENT AND

02:15:11.236 --> 02:15:12.471
THOSE DIFFERENCES WOULD BE

02:15:12.537 --> 02:15:14.873
BASED ON- BASS LINES THAT ARE

02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:16.741
CLEARLY ESTABLISHED AT THE

02:15:16.808 --> 02:15:19.811
START OF THE PROGRAM. THIS

02:15:19.878 --> 02:15:21.513
PROGRAM ALSO NEEDS TO BE BASED

02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:23.715
ON WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE THE

02:15:23.782 --> 02:15:25.851
CORE VALUES OF OUR PROGRAM-

02:15:25.917 --> 02:15:28.286
WE'VE- HAVE REALLY ESTABLISHED

02:15:28.353 --> 02:15:30.121
CORE VALUES WITHIN THE LAN

02:15:30.188 --> 02:15:33.258
TURMAN ACT. ON IT OUT THINGS-

02:15:33.325 --> 02:15:34.626
YOU KNOW ERIC SEGMENT TALKED

02:15:34.693 --> 02:15:36.928
EARLIER ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE

02:15:36.995 --> 02:15:37.863
AND THAT THIS REALLY IS A

02:15:37.929 --> 02:15:40.432
PROGRAM. TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S

02:15:40.499 --> 02:15:42.000
LIVES AND FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE

02:15:42.067 --> 02:15:44.302
EQUAL LIVES AND SO WHEN WE

02:15:44.369 --> 02:15:46.304
THINK ABOUT THAT. LOOKING AT

02:15:46.371 --> 02:15:48.907
BIG PICTURE TOPICS LIKE

02:15:48.974 --> 02:15:49.441
EMPLOYMENT COMMUNITY

02:15:49.508 --> 02:15:51.576
INTEGRATION REDUCTION OF

02:15:51.643 --> 02:15:54.045
SERVICE DISPARITIES CHOICE. ON

02:15:54.112 --> 02:15:56.081
AND OF COURSE BECAUSE IT IS

02:15:56.147 --> 02:15:59.384
COMING H. CBS COMPLIANCE. UP

02:15:59.451 --> 02:16:01.253
OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE

02:16:01.319 --> 02:16:03.455
FOCUS ON MAYBE THREE OF THESE

02:16:03.522 --> 02:16:05.257
IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS AND

02:16:05.323 --> 02:16:07.325
PARTICULAR I'M AS THE PROGRAM

02:16:07.392 --> 02:16:09.494
IS GETTING UP AND RUNNING AND

02:16:09.561 --> 02:16:11.062
WE'RE LEARNING HOW TO- ASSESS

02:16:11.129 --> 02:16:13.265
THE DATA. COULD EVEN PICK THREE

02:16:13.331 --> 02:16:15.000
WHERE THE DATA IS MORE EASILY

02:16:15.066 --> 02:16:17.369
OBTAINABLE FOR EXAMPLE H. CBS

02:16:17.435 --> 02:16:19.538
COMPLIANCE WHERE WERE GATHERING

02:16:19.604 --> 02:16:22.774
THAT DATA ANYWAY. ALL YOU KNOW

02:16:22.841 --> 02:16:24.609
THE SAME MAY BE TRUE WITH-

02:16:24.676 --> 02:16:25.877
COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED

02:16:25.944 --> 02:16:28.213
EMPLOYMENT ON AND EVEN WITHIN

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:29.814
POS DISPARITIES AND I KNOW WE

02:16:29.881 --> 02:16:31.583
HAVE A WHOLE SECTION LATER ON

02:16:31.650 --> 02:16:35.020
THAT. UP BUT WE ALSO NEED TO

02:16:35.086 --> 02:16:36.955
NOT O THIS IN A VACUUM IT HAS

02:16:37.022 --> 02:16:38.390
TO BE PART OF A COORDINATED

02:16:38.456 --> 02:16:40.492
INITIATIVE WITH ALL OF THE-

02:16:40.559 --> 02:16:42.794
THINGS WERE GOING IN OUR SYSTEM.

02:16:42.861 --> 02:16:46.298
TO BE EFFECTIVE. UP WE ALSO

02:16:46.364 --> 02:16:49.134
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ON THE DATA

02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:51.303
AND I WAS GLAD TO HEAR YOU-

02:16:51.369 --> 02:16:53.805
ASKING THAT THEY REALLY WORK ON

02:16:53.872 --> 02:16:54.739
COMING UP WITH THAT AT DATA

02:16:54.806 --> 02:16:56.241
SYSTEM BECAUSE I THINK

02:16:56.308 --> 02:16:58.209
ESTABLISHING THAT THAT BASELINE

02:16:58.276 --> 02:17:00.779
DATA IS GOING TO BE INTEGRAL TO

02:17:00.845 --> 02:17:03.181
THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM. UP

02:17:03.248 --> 02:17:04.316
AND THEN WE THINK ABOUT

02:17:04.382 --> 02:17:06.251
REPORTING IT REALLY SHOULD BE

02:17:06.318 --> 02:17:08.920
AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND WAY.

02:17:08.987 --> 02:17:09.854
BECAUSE IF WE WANT TO

02:17:09.921 --> 02:17:11.823
COMMUNICATE SUCCESS TO THE

02:17:11.890 --> 02:17:13.758
PEOPLE RECEIVING THE SERVICES

02:17:13.825 --> 02:17:14.559
THEY HAVE TO BE UNDERSTOOD.

02:17:14.626 --> 02:17:17.195
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS. UP

02:17:17.262 --> 02:17:20.298
AND OF. PART OF THAT IS

02:17:20.365 --> 02:17:22.167
DEVELOPING IT IN CONSULTATION

02:17:22.233 --> 02:17:24.502
WITH STAKEHOLDERS- I WILL SAY I

02:17:24.569 --> 02:17:26.304
WAS PLEASED TO SEE OVER THE

02:17:26.371 --> 02:17:28.974
PAST COUPLE OF DAYS- THAT THE

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:31.042
DEPARTMENT IS CAN BE USING THE

02:17:31.109 --> 02:17:32.911
SYSTEM IN FISCAL REFORM GROUP

02:17:32.978 --> 02:17:35.046
AND THEN ALSO THE OVERSIGHT AND

02:17:35.113 --> 02:17:36.948
TRANSPARENCY GROUP WITHIN THE-

02:17:37.015 --> 02:17:39.818
DS TASK. FORCE TO THAT SOME OF

02:17:39.884 --> 02:17:41.386
THESE IDEAS AND WAS EVEN MORE

02:17:41.453 --> 02:17:43.154
PLEASED TO HEAR YOU SAY TODAY

02:17:43.221 --> 02:17:44.723
THAT THERE WILL BE ACTUAL GOALS

02:17:44.789 --> 02:17:46.758
TO RESPOND TO BECAUSE I THINK

02:17:46.825 --> 02:17:48.059
SOMETIMES THESE LARGE TOPICS

02:17:48.126 --> 02:17:50.228
ARE BROACHED AND PEOPLE DON'T

02:17:50.295 --> 02:17:52.030
REALLY KNOW HOW TO RESPOND. BUT

02:17:52.097 --> 02:17:52.564
IF YOU GIVE THEM SOMETHING

02:17:52.631 --> 02:17:54.265
CONCRETE TO RESPOND TO YOU

02:17:54.332 --> 02:17:55.166
ACTUALLY CAN HEAR WHAT

02:17:55.233 --> 02:17:57.135
STAKEHOLDERS THANK. SO ONCE

02:17:57.202 --> 02:17:59.070
AGAIN I'M WE APPRECIATE THAT

02:17:59.137 --> 02:18:00.572
MINISTRATIONS EFFORTS AND THE

02:18:00.639 --> 02:18:02.374
DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO BRING

02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:04.676
OUT COMES TO OUR SYSTEM- AS WE

02:18:04.743 --> 02:18:07.112
THINK THAT THOSE ARE REALLY

02:18:07.178 --> 02:18:10.148
VITAL TO OUR SUCCESS. THANK YOU.

02:18:10.215 --> 02:18:16.755
NEXT WE HAVE ALISON MARIN'S. MY

02:18:16.821 --> 02:18:18.690
NAME IS ALLISON RANTS- MY

02:18:18.757 --> 02:18:19.924
FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SON MIKE A IS

02:18:19.991 --> 02:18:21.092
A CLIENT OF SAN ANDREAS

02:18:21.159 --> 02:18:22.193
REGIONAL CENTER AND I'M

02:18:22.260 --> 02:18:25.797
SPEAKING ON THIS ISSUE AS A

02:18:25.864 --> 02:18:26.331
BOARD MEMBER OF DISABILITY

02:18:26.398 --> 02:18:29.067
VOICES UNITED SO WE STRONGLY

02:18:29.134 --> 02:18:30.568
SUPPORT THE USE OF PERFORMANCE

02:18:30.635 --> 02:18:32.103
INCENTIVES I'M ONE OF THE MOST

02:18:32.170 --> 02:18:33.638
COMMON FRUSTRATIONS THAT WE

02:18:33.705 --> 02:18:34.939
HEAR FROM FAMILIES AND SELF

02:18:35.006 --> 02:18:36.574
ADVOCATES. IS IT REGIONAL

02:18:36.641 --> 02:18:38.076
CENTERS DON'T PRIORITIZE

02:18:38.143 --> 02:18:39.144
ACTIVITIES THAT IMPROVE THEIR

02:18:39.210 --> 02:18:41.446
WELL BEING. INSTEAD WE OFTEN

02:18:41.513 --> 02:18:42.347
HEAR THAT REGIONAL CENTERS

02:18:42.414 --> 02:18:44.315
PRIOR TO HIS ACTIVITIES THAT

02:18:44.382 --> 02:18:44.849
IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF

02:18:44.916 --> 02:18:46.951
REGIONAL CENTERS- BUT OF COURSE

02:18:47.018 --> 02:18:48.620
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT ONE WOULD

02:18:48.687 --> 02:18:49.988
EXPECT FROM A SYSTEM THAT DOES

02:18:50.055 --> 02:18:51.923
NOT COMPENSATE REGIONAL CENTERS

02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:53.358
BASED ON HOW WELL THEY IMPROVE

02:18:53.425 --> 02:18:55.293
OUTCOMES. FOR THE CONSUMERS

02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:58.196
THEY SERVE. THE ONLY WAY TO

02:18:58.263 --> 02:19:00.231
CHANGE THE STATUS QUO IS FOR

02:19:00.298 --> 02:19:01.933
NEW FISCAL INCENTIVES TO BE

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.102
EXPLICITLY TIED TO CONSUMER

02:19:04.169 --> 02:19:05.804
CENTERED PERFORMANCE MEASURES.

02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:07.939
THAT BEING SAID. WE SHARE IT

02:19:08.006 --> 02:19:10.575
DRC'S CONCERNS WITH THE TRAILER

02:19:10.642 --> 02:19:11.109
BILL LANGUAGE IS CURRENTLY

02:19:11.176 --> 02:19:13.178
WRITTEN. FIRST WE FEEL THAT

02:19:13.244 --> 02:19:15.580
MAKING PARTICIPATION VOLUNTARY

02:19:15.647 --> 02:19:16.815
DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF THE

02:19:16.881 --> 02:19:18.950
PROGRAM AND IN FACT COULD EVEN

02:19:19.017 --> 02:19:20.251
MAGNIFIED DISPARITIES BY

02:19:20.318 --> 02:19:21.586
ALLOWING LOW PERFORMING

02:19:21.653 --> 02:19:23.988
REGIONAL CENTERS. TO OPT OUT

02:19:24.055 --> 02:19:25.090
AND ESSENTIALLY SETTLE FOR

02:19:25.156 --> 02:19:27.225
MEDIOCRITY AND THOSE THAT DID

02:19:27.292 --> 02:19:28.827
CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE- THAT

02:19:28.893 --> 02:19:30.095
WOULD MOST LIKELY CHOOSE THE

02:19:30.161 --> 02:19:32.797
LOW HANGING FRUIT- SO WE THINK

02:19:32.864 --> 02:19:34.733
CONSUMERS DESERVE MORE AND THE

02:19:34.799 --> 02:19:38.303
PROGRAM MUST BE MANDATORY FOR

02:19:38.369 --> 02:19:39.838
ALL REGIONAL CENTERS. A IN A

02:19:39.904 --> 02:19:41.906
BIND SOME OF THE COMMENTS THE

02:19:41.973 --> 02:19:43.675
GRAB BAG APPROACH TOWARDS GOAL

02:19:43.742 --> 02:19:45.844
SETTING IN WHICH EACH REGIONAL

02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:47.479
CENTER GETS TO PICK AND CHOOSE

02:19:47.545 --> 02:19:49.314
WHICH GOALS THAT WANTS TO WORK

02:19:49.380 --> 02:19:51.816
TOWARDS IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IF

02:19:51.883 --> 02:19:53.084
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT REGIONAL

02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:54.385
CENTERS ANNUAL PERFORMANCE

02:19:54.452 --> 02:19:57.021
CONTRACTS IN YEAR AND REPORTS

02:19:57.088 --> 02:19:57.822
ALL OF WHICH ARE ON DDS IS

02:19:57.889 --> 02:20:00.158
WEBSITE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT

02:20:00.225 --> 02:20:01.659
YOU'LL FIND IT'S ESSENTIALLY A

02:20:01.726 --> 02:20:04.095
HODGE PODGE OF BENCHMARKS THE

02:20:04.162 --> 02:20:05.597
VERY TERM REGIONAL CENTER TO

02:20:05.663 --> 02:20:06.798
REGIONAL CENTER SOMETIMES EVEN

02:20:06.865 --> 02:20:08.633
FROM TWO YEAR AND OR NOT

02:20:08.700 --> 02:20:10.301
CONSISTENTLY MEASURED OVER TIME

02:20:10.368 --> 02:20:13.037
WE KNOW OF THIS APPROACH IS NOT

02:20:13.104 --> 02:20:14.339
CONDUCIVE TO ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:20:14.405 --> 02:20:16.741
PERFECT OUTCOMES MUST BUILD ON

02:20:16.808 --> 02:20:18.209
CURRENT POLICY INITIATIVES

02:20:18.276 --> 02:20:20.145
POINT PICKING UP AND YOUR SEATS

02:20:20.211 --> 02:20:22.547
COMMENTS AND MUST BE UNIFORM

02:20:22.614 --> 02:20:25.216
ACROSS THE SYSTEM NOW TO BE

02:20:25.283 --> 02:20:27.085
CLEAR AND THIS PICKS UP A

02:20:27.152 --> 02:20:28.520
DOCTOR BARGES COMMENTS

02:20:28.586 --> 02:20:29.821
DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTER NOT

02:20:29.888 --> 02:20:32.524
ALL DECIDE TO MOVE FORWARD IN

02:20:32.590 --> 02:20:33.858
THE SAME WAY EVEN THOUGH IT BE

02:20:33.925 --> 02:20:36.161
WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME GOAL

02:20:36.227 --> 02:20:37.695
FOR EXAMPLE ONE REGIONAL CENTER

02:20:37.762 --> 02:20:39.564
MAY DECIDE TO IMPROVE

02:20:39.631 --> 02:20:41.966
COMPETITOR GRATED POINT. I HAVE

02:20:42.033 --> 02:20:44.002
DURING ADICIONAL IN HOUSE

02:20:44.068 --> 02:20:46.271
EMPLOYMENT SPECIALIST ANOTHER

02:20:46.337 --> 02:20:47.305
MAY PARTNER WITH CA BASED

02:20:47.372 --> 02:20:51.209
ORGANIZATION OR LOCAL

02:20:51.276 --> 02:20:54.479
BUSINESSES WE ARE ALL IN A VERY

02:20:54.546 --> 02:20:56.114
SERVICE VERY FACT I THINK THE

02:20:56.181 --> 02:20:56.981
THING WE WANT ENCOURAGE THAT

02:20:57.048 --> 02:21:01.019
KIND OF IN A- HOWEVER. WE DON'T

02:21:01.085 --> 02:21:01.653
CENTERS THESE. FOR THE SAME SET

02:21:01.719 --> 02:21:02.654
OF GOALS AND THEY SHOULD BE

02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:04.823
MEASURED IN THE SAME WAYS AND I

02:21:04.889 --> 02:21:06.457
REALLY CAN'T UNDERSCORE ENOUGH

02:21:06.524 --> 02:21:07.592
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DATA

02:21:07.659 --> 02:21:08.726
COLLECTION ISSUES THAT I'M NOT

02:21:08.793 --> 02:21:10.094
GOING TO. YOU KNOW SAY IT

02:21:10.161 --> 02:21:12.564
AGAIN. BUT YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE

02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:14.632
IDEAS ESSENTIALLY A NON STARTER

02:21:14.699 --> 02:21:15.667
AND LESS WE CAN AT LEAST TO

02:21:15.733 --> 02:21:17.235
FIND A SET OF METRICS WE REALLY

02:21:17.302 --> 02:21:18.536
BELIEVE WE UNDERSTAND ARE

02:21:18.603 --> 02:21:20.405
TRANSPARENT. YOU KNOW I WANT TO

02:21:20.471 --> 02:21:22.273
ECHO ALL THOSE COMMENTS BUT WE

02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:24.309
ALSO AGREE WITH SEVERAL OF THE

02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:26.878
CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY ALEJO. ON

02:21:26.945 --> 02:21:29.547
FIRST AND THIS IS A- HAS TO DO

02:21:29.614 --> 02:21:30.849
WITH THE DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM

02:21:30.915 --> 02:21:32.250
OUTCOMES HAVE TO BE MEASURED

02:21:32.317 --> 02:21:33.885
WITH CLEAR OBSERVABLE MEANT

02:21:33.952 --> 02:21:36.120
METRICS. BUT WE THINK IT'S

02:21:36.187 --> 02:21:38.122
BETTER TO PRIORITIZE ONE OR TWO

02:21:38.189 --> 02:21:40.024
REALLY RELIABLE BENCHMARKS THIS

02:21:40.091 --> 02:21:42.360
YEAR. THAN TO POSTPONE ALL

02:21:42.427 --> 02:21:44.329
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES UNTIL

02:21:44.395 --> 02:21:46.297
THE SYSTEM IS FULLY FUNDED.

02:21:46.364 --> 02:21:48.466
AFTER ALL THAT DAY MAY NEVER

02:21:48.533 --> 02:21:51.169
COME. SO WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD

02:21:51.236 --> 02:21:54.038
START SMALL AND BUILD FROM

02:21:54.105 --> 02:21:56.374
THERE. SECONDLY THE REGIONAL IT

02:21:56.441 --> 02:21:57.742
REGIONAL CENTER STAFF WHOSE

02:21:57.809 --> 02:21:59.677
BEHAVIOR MOST DIRECTLY AFFECTS

02:21:59.744 --> 02:22:01.446
OUTCOMES ARE THE ONES WHO NEED

02:22:01.512 --> 02:22:03.414
TO BE INCENTIVIZE. THAT WAS ONE

02:22:03.481 --> 02:22:04.182
OF THE THEMES THAT ELLIE-

02:22:04.249 --> 02:22:05.884
PICKED UP FROM THE RAND STUDY

02:22:05.950 --> 02:22:07.185
ON KIND OF WHAT HOW WITH THE

02:22:07.252 --> 02:22:08.219
PROGRAMS THAT WORK IN THOSE

02:22:08.286 --> 02:22:09.888
THAT DON'T. AGAIN WE COULDN'T

02:22:09.954 --> 02:22:11.823
AGREE MORE WITH THAT. SO FOR

02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:13.558
EXAMPLE WE WOULD NOT SUPPORT

02:22:13.625 --> 02:22:15.159
REWARDING EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT

02:22:15.226 --> 02:22:17.128
TEAMS OF REGIONAL CENTERS THE

02:22:17.195 --> 02:22:18.396
REWARDS NEED TO GO TO THE

02:22:18.463 --> 02:22:19.597
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DOING THE

02:22:19.664 --> 02:22:21.699
HANDS ON WORK ESPECIALLY

02:22:21.766 --> 02:22:23.868
COORDINATORS BECAUSE THAT'S

02:22:23.935 --> 02:22:25.036
WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD.

02:22:25.103 --> 02:22:27.105
WE BELIEVE THESE CONCERNS CAN

02:22:27.171 --> 02:22:28.506
AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGH

02:22:28.573 --> 02:22:30.608
A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. SO WE

02:22:30.675 --> 02:22:31.376
LOOK FORWARD TO COLLABORATING

02:22:31.442 --> 02:22:33.044
WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO

02:22:33.111 --> 02:22:34.445
DEVELOP A MEANINGFUL

02:22:34.512 --> 02:22:35.980
PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN.

02:22:36.047 --> 02:22:38.016
THAT MOVES THE SYSTEM FORWARD

02:22:38.082 --> 02:22:39.350
TOWARDS ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE

02:22:39.417 --> 02:22:40.652
CONVEYS TO CONSUMERS AND

02:22:40.718 --> 02:22:42.520
FAMILIES THAT THE OUTCOMES THAT

02:22:42.587 --> 02:22:44.088
MATTER TO THEM. ARE THE

02:22:44.155 --> 02:22:45.890
OUTCOMES THAT REGIONAL CENTERS

02:22:45.957 --> 02:22:47.592
WILL BE REWARDED FOR HELPING TO

02:22:47.659 --> 02:22:49.861
BRING ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK

02:22:49.928 --> 02:22:51.429

PROPOSAL. AS WE'VE HEARD THE

02:23:18.656 --> 02:23:19.724
GOALS OF CALIFORNIANS REGIONAL

SOME OF OUR CLIENTS I HAVE A

02:45:37.661 --> 02:45:40.130
PRETTY LARGE CASELOAD THAT AND

02:45:40.196 --> 02:45:43.800
GROWING SINCE I STARTED- BASIC

02:45:43.867 --> 02:45:45.135
BUT I WANT TO SAY IT'S KIND OF

02:45:45.201 --> 02:45:47.070
LIKE AT THE HUMAN LEVEL FROM

02:45:47.137 --> 02:45:48.271
FOR. AS WHERE FIELD FOR BECAUSE

02:45:48.338 --> 02:45:50.540
IF ERRORS WHAT I SEE IS THAT

02:45:50.607 --> 02:45:52.142
ALL OF US AE SEVERELY

02:45:52.208 --> 02:45:54.744
UNDERPAID. ARE STARTING WAGES

02:45:54.811 --> 02:45:55.512
EIGHTEEN FIFTY AN HOUR AND

02:45:55.578 --> 02:45:57.614
THAT'S FOR A VERY HIGH VOLUME-

02:45:57.681 --> 02:45:59.883
COMPLEX SOCIAL WORK JOB THAT'S

02:45:59.949 --> 02:46:02.218
VERY STRESSFUL- THE PEOPLE WHO

02:46:02.285 --> 02:46:03.787
STAY IN THE FIELD ARE THERE

02:46:03.853 --> 02:46:06.156
BECAUSE WE ARE. BASICALLY

02:46:06.222 --> 02:46:08.291
INTERNALLY SENT TO FIVE IS THAT

02:46:08.358 --> 02:46:11.061
IS WHAT I WOULD SAY WE- WE CARE

02:46:11.127 --> 02:46:13.296
DEEPLY ABOUT OUR CLIENTS HEALTH

02:46:13.363 --> 02:46:15.332
AND WELL BEING. I COULD SAY

02:46:15.398 --> 02:46:16.700
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE

02:46:16.766 --> 02:46:17.967
HAVE COME THROUGH MY PROGRAMS

02:46:18.034 --> 02:46:20.236
THAT. COULD POSSIBLY BE DEAD OR

02:46:20.303 --> 02:46:21.571
SEVERELY ILL IF WE WERE NOT

02:46:21.638 --> 02:46:25.508
SUPPORTING THEM. AND WE CARE-

02:46:25.575 --> 02:46:27.744
AND WHEN PEOPLE DO LEAVE THIS

02:46:27.811 --> 02:46:29.412
POSITION THEY LEAVE BECAUSE

02:46:29.479 --> 02:46:32.549
THAT WAGE IS NOT ENOUGH- TO PAY

02:46:32.615 --> 02:46:34.617
RENT. MOST PEOPLE HAVE SECOND

02:46:34.684 --> 02:46:36.453
AND THIRD JOBS JUST TO PAY RENT

02:46:36.519 --> 02:46:37.354
WHILE DOING THIS WORK IN SAN

02:46:37.420 --> 02:46:41.391
FRANCISCO- AND AT SOME POINT

02:46:41.458 --> 02:46:44.094
THEY BURN OUT. AND THEY'RE VERY

02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:46.396
SAD TO LEAVE THEIR CLIENTS. SO

02:46:46.463 --> 02:46:47.564
BASICALLY WHAT I'M SAYING BUT I

02:46:47.630 --> 02:46:50.867
DON'T THINK IT'S A REWARD TO. I

02:46:50.934 --> 02:46:51.468
WOULDN'T CALL IT A REWARD TO

02:46:51.534 --> 02:46:55.205
GIVE SOMEONE A LIVING WAGE. I

02:46:55.271 --> 02:46:59.676
THINK THAT WE FIND THE RIGHT

02:46:59.743 --> 02:47:00.310
WORDS. DOING VERY HUMAN WORK

02:47:00.377 --> 02:47:04.214
THAT IS SO NECESSARY. TO HAVE

02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:05.949
MORE MONEY TO LIVE AND TO BE

02:47:06.015 --> 02:47:06.850
ABLE TO CONTINUE DOING WHAT

02:47:06.916 --> 02:47:08.118
WE'RE DOING THANK YOU. THANK

DISABLED INDIVIDUAL. I WOULD

02:47:17.961 --> 02:47:19.095
JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I REALLY

02:47:19.162 --> 02:47:21.364

CERTAIN GOALS BEFORE THEY GET

02:47:25.735 --> 02:47:31.040
MORE MONEY. I HAVE MY IDEA IS

02:47:31.107 --> 02:47:33.910
WHY DON'T YOU ASK FOR FAMILIES.

02:47:33.977 --> 02:47:36.780

02:50:04.494 --> 02:50:05.728
REGIONAL CENTERS IN ALL PARTS

02:50:05.795 --> 02:50:07.330
OF THE STATE WOULD EXPECT THAT

02:50:07.397 --> 02:50:08.331
THE LEVEL OF SERVICES AND

02:50:08.398 --> 02:50:12.235
THINGS. ARE DIFFERENT- AS BASED

02:50:12.302 --> 02:50:15.004

AN OPT IN- I THINK IS

02:50:25.715 --> 02:50:27.283
UNACCEPTABLE IF YOU WANT DATA

02:50:27.350 --> 02:50:29.152
YOU WANT DATA FROM EVERYONE.

02:50:29.218 --> 02:50:32.655

ACCOUNTABILITY IS FUNDAMENTAL

02:52:44.053 --> 02:52:45.688
IN FACT I THINK THE REGIONAL

02:52:45.755 --> 02:52:46.789
CENTERS ONE ACCOUNTABILITY I

02:52:46.856 --> 02:52:48.424

PROVIDE THE SERVICES- EXPECT

02:52:52.028 --> 02:52:54.530
THE ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT I HAVE

02:52:54.597 --> 02:52:55.932
TO TELL YOU THAT MY BIG BASIC

02:52:55.998 --> 02:52:57.567
CONCERN HERE IS THAT WE HAVE A

02:52:57.633 --> 02:52:59.836
SYSTEM LITERALLY FALLING APART

02:52:59.902 --> 02:53:01.537
IN FRONT OF OUR VERY OWN. PACE

02:53:01.604 --> 02:53:02.939
WE ARE EXPECTING THESE

02:53:03.005 --> 02:53:04.974
INDIVIDUALS TO GET QUALITY

02:53:05.041 --> 02:53:08.111
MEASURABLE CARE. AND YET WE'RE

02:53:08.177 --> 02:53:10.780
DOING IT FOR MINIMUM WAGE. WE

02:53:10.847 --> 02:53:12.615
EXPECT THESE ASSOCIATIONS IN

02:53:12.682 --> 02:53:14.851
THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO BE ABLE

02:53:14.917 --> 02:53:16.219
TO DO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

02:53:16.285 --> 02:53:18.321
WE EXPECT THEM TO DO. AND YET

02:53:18.387 --> 02:53:21.724
THEIR RATES. ARE POVERTY RATES.

02:53:21.791 --> 02:53:23.826
THIS IS THE REAL PLACE THAT WE

02:53:23.893 --> 02:53:27.764
FIND. OF SO MANY WHO RECEIVE

02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:30.600
THESE SERVICES. I UNDERSTAND

02:53:30.666 --> 02:53:31.734
THAT IT CAN BE FRUSTRATING FOR

02:53:31.801 --> 02:53:36.973
FAMILIES- TO ACCESS A SYSTEM.

02:53:37.039 --> 02:53:38.708
IN WHICH- WHAT WE DON'T

02:53:38.775 --> 02:53:39.609
ADEQUATE. NUMBERS OF

02:53:39.675 --> 02:53:40.843
INDIVIDUALS WERE NOT

02:53:40.910 --> 02:53:41.811
COMPENSATING THESE

OUT WE CAN GET ACT ATTIC QUICK

02:54:10.873 --> 02:54:13.009
MEASUREMENT. FROM A SYSTEM

02:54:13.075 --> 02:54:15.545
UNDER HUGE STRESS IS TO HELP

02:59:19.515 --> 02:59:22.985
IDENTIFY A VERY SPECIFIC GOAL

02:59:23.052 --> 02:59:24.620
IN PERFORMANCE MEASURE THAT IS

02:59:24.687 --> 02:59:25.654
TIED TO THE SERVICE

02:59:25.721 --> 02:59:29.125
COORDINATION THAT DOESN'T HAVE.

02:59:29.191 --> 02:59:30.459
ALL THE RELIANCE ON SAY

02:59:30.526 --> 02:59:31.660
COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED

02:59:31.727 --> 02:59:33.462
EMPLOYMENT OR SOME OTHER AREAS

02:59:33.529 --> 02:59:35.431
WE CAN IDENTIFY THOSE THINGS IN

02:59:35.498 --> 02:59:37.233
WHICH THE SERVICE COORDINATORS

02:59:37.299 --> 02:59:39.001
AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE

02:59:39.068 --> 02:59:41.537
CONTROL OF THAT THEY HAVE THAT

02:59:41.604 --> 02:59:42.938
ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO AFFECT

02:59:43.005 --> 02:59:44.940
CHANGE AND SO IF THEY HAVE THE

02:59:45.007 --> 02:59:46.609
ABILITY TO AFFECT CHANGE WE

02:59:46.675 --> 02:59:48.210
HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEASURE

02:59:48.277 --> 02:59:49.945
THAT CHANGE. THEN WE HAVE THE

02:59:50.012 --> 02:59:51.447
ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:59:51.514 --> 02:59:52.948
THOSE INCENTIVES TIED TO THAT

02:59:53.015 --> 02:59:54.750
CHANGE SO THAT'S WHERE I YOU

02:59:54.817 --> 02:59:56.152
KNOW I KNOW THAT WITHOUT

02:59:56.218 --> 02:59:58.220
FURTHER MORE DETAIL IT'S HARD

02:59:58.287 --> 03:00:00.823

CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

03:00:27.249 --> 03:00:29.084
THOSE RESOURCES TO MEASURE THAT

03:00:29.151 --> 03:00:30.386
ACROSS THE STATE BETWEEN EACH

03:00:30.452 --> 03:00:31.921

INDICATORS WE KNOW THAT IF WE

03:00:35.291 --> 03:00:36.559

CURRENTLY NOT AT ONE TO FORTY

03:07:01.310 --> 03:07:01.810

FOR OTHER AGE GROUPS AND OTHER

03:07:16.959 --> 03:07:18.493
TYPES OF CONSUMERS ARE OUT OF

03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:20.495
COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW AND

03:07:20.562 --> 03:07:22.464

OUT OF COMPLIANCE- WE DO HAVE

03:07:30.672 --> 03:07:31.907
SOME CONCERNS THAT THIS COULD

03:07:31.974 --> 03:07:34.643
PUT OUR FEDERAL MEDICAID WAIVER

03:07:34.710 --> 03:07:37.212
FUNDING AT RISK. I'M NEXT WE

03:07:37.279 --> 03:07:38.614
WOULD NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH EARLY

03:07:38.680 --> 03:07:40.482

03:07:40.549 --> 03:07:41.817
IMPORTANT AGENT IMPORTANT

03:07:41.883 --> 03:07:43.652
MILESTONE IN A CONSUMER'S LIFE

03:07:43.719 --> 03:07:46.355
IT'S NOT CLEAR. A SPECIFICALLY

03:07:46.421 --> 03:07:48.991
WHY AGES THREE FOUR AND FIVE

03:07:49.057 --> 03:07:51.493
SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED OVER-

03:07:51.560 --> 03:07:53.462
INFANTS AND TODDLERS IN EARLY

03:07:53.528 --> 03:07:56.131

03:08:04.106 --> 03:08:06.608

03:08:10.345 --> 03:08:11.580
IT'S UNCLEAR IF THIS IS THE

03:08:11.647 --> 03:08:13.582
MOST URGENT NEED ACROSS EVERY

SIR. HI KATIE HERBERGER

EVERYONE ELSE WAS SO SOFT

03:15:22.644 --> 03:15:25.013
SPOKEN EXCEPT ME. UP BUT THAT

03:15:25.080 --> 03:15:27.482
COULD GO WITH MY- POINT THAT

03:15:27.549 --> 03:15:28.783
I'M A FORMER EARLY INTERVENTION

03:15:28.850 --> 03:15:30.618
TEACHER SO THE LITTLE ONES ARE

03:15:30.685 --> 03:15:32.253
CLOSE TO MY HEART AND SO I

03:15:32.320 --> 03:15:34.489
ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND. HOW OLD

03:15:34.556 --> 03:15:37.459
THEY WERE PICKED AS SORT OF THE

03:15:37.525 --> 03:15:39.260
GROUP TO PRIORITIZE IN REDUCING

03:15:39.327 --> 03:15:41.529
CASELOADS OF BECAUSE THAT IS A

03:15:41.596 --> 03:15:43.465
PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING TIME

03:15:43.531 --> 03:15:44.833
THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT OTHER

03:15:44.899 --> 03:15:45.867
TIMES OF LIFE FOR NOT

03:15:45.934 --> 03:15:47.168
CHALLENGING. BUT I DO THINK

03:15:47.235 --> 03:15:48.770
THAT THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES

03:15:48.837 --> 03:15:49.671
THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THAT AGE

03:15:49.737 --> 03:15:51.806
GROUP. IN REGARDS TO THE EIGHT

03:15:51.873 --> 03:15:54.142
HUNDRED SERVICE COORDINATORS- I

03:15:54.209 --> 03:15:55.410
THINK WE DEFINITELY HAVE A

03:15:55.477 --> 03:15:57.779
SERVICE COORDINATOR SHORTAGE WE

03:15:57.846 --> 03:15:59.547
DEFINITELY HAVE CASELOADS THAT

03:15:59.614 --> 03:16:01.382
ARE RIDICULOUSLY HIGH AND I

03:16:01.449 --> 03:16:02.584
WILL TELL YOU MY ADVOCATES.

03:16:02.650 --> 03:16:04.385
OFTEN COMPLAIN TO ME ABOUT

03:16:04.452 --> 03:16:06.354
THEIR INABILITY TO WORK WITH

03:16:06.421 --> 03:16:08.389
SERVICE COORDINATORS BECAUSE OF

03:16:08.456 --> 03:16:08.990
UNCOVERED CASELOADS AND OTHER

03:16:09.057 --> 03:16:10.658
PROBLEMS HOWEVER I THINK THAT

03:16:10.725 --> 03:16:12.060
THERE MAY BE MORE OF A

03:16:12.127 --> 03:16:13.661
DISCUSSION TO BE HAD RATHER

03:16:13.728 --> 03:16:15.230
THAN JUST HIRING EIGHT HUNDRED

03:16:15.296 --> 03:16:17.065
SERVICE COORDINATORS. AND THAT

03:16:17.132 --> 03:16:19.734
COULD INCLUDE A ONE TIME ON

03:16:19.801 --> 03:16:21.703
EXPENDITURES RELATED TO

03:16:21.769 --> 03:16:22.770
TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD MAKE

03:16:22.837 --> 03:16:24.572
SERVICE COORDINATORS MORE

03:16:24.639 --> 03:16:26.174
EFFICIENT IT COULD BE LOOKING

03:16:26.241 --> 03:16:28.843
AT OTHER PRIORITIZE CASELOADS

03:16:28.910 --> 03:16:30.512
SUCH AS BILINGUAL CASELOADS. ON

03:16:30.578 --> 03:16:32.614
SO THEM I THINK THAT IS WE NEED

03:16:32.680 --> 03:16:34.449
A LARGER DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT

03:16:34.516 --> 03:16:35.116
IT MEANS TO BE A SERVICE

03:16:35.183 --> 03:16:37.252
COORDINATOR WE NEED TO LOOK AT

03:16:37.318 --> 03:16:38.553
THE H. CBS RULES AND SEE IF

03:16:38.620 --> 03:16:39.888
THERE ARE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES

03:16:39.954 --> 03:16:41.589
OF SERVICE COORDINATOR THAT MAY

03:16:41.656 --> 03:16:43.658
BE RESEARCHED. AND SO I THINK

03:16:43.725 --> 03:16:44.893
THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY

03:16:44.959 --> 03:16:46.094

03:19:42.804 --> 03:19:44.572
DIFFERENTIAL ON TOP OF A BAD

03:19:44.639 --> 03:19:47.508
BASS AND SO THE PROPOSAL ITSELF

03:19:47.575 --> 03:19:48.843
IS UNDER FUNDED BY BY OUR

03:19:48.910 --> 03:19:50.611
CALCULATIONS ABOUT FOURTEEN

03:19:50.678 --> 03:19:52.413

UNITED MY SIGN IN HIS TWENTY

03:19:59.787 --> 03:20:00.655
THREE YEARS OR TWENTY YEARS

03:20:00.722 --> 03:20:01.923
WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER HAS

03:20:01.989 --> 03:20:02.890
HAD AMAZING SERVICE

03:20:02.957 --> 03:20:04.659
COORDINATORS AND HE'S HAD VERY

03:20:04.726 --> 03:20:06.694
MEDIOCRE SERVICE COORDINATORS.

03:20:06.761 --> 03:20:08.763
AND THEY'RE ALL THE SAME RATIO.

03:20:08.830 --> 03:20:11.499
IT TO ME IT'S THERE ARE SOME

03:20:11.566 --> 03:20:12.700
REALLY TERRIFIC PEOPLE IN THE

03:20:12.767 --> 03:20:15.703
SYSTEM. AND THERE'S SOME FOLKS

03:20:15.770 --> 03:20:17.338
WHO WANT TO CLOCK IN AND CLOCK

03:20:17.405 --> 03:20:21.142
OUT AND I THINK THAT. TO ONCE

03:20:21.209 --> 03:20:22.910

AGAIN ONCE AGAIN TO ADD MORE

03:20:27.048 --> 03:20:28.683
MONEY TO THE SYSTEM WITHOUT

03:20:28.750 --> 03:20:31.085
ASKING FOR ANYTHING IN RETURN.

03:20:31.152 --> 03:20:33.221
SEEMS TO MAKE NO SENSE. AND I

03:20:33.287 --> 03:20:34.756
THINK THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME

03:20:34.822 --> 03:20:36.557
STANDARDS THE PERFORMANCE

03:20:36.624 --> 03:20:38.526
MEASURES THAT IF WE WANT TO.

03:20:38.593 --> 03:20:39.827
LOWER CASE THREE SHOWS THAT

03:20:39.894 --> 03:20:41.429
THERE HAS TO BE EXPECTATIONS

03:20:41.496 --> 03:20:43.231
MADE OF SERVICE COORDINATORS I

03:20:43.297 --> 03:20:45.166
HEAR THE STORIES PARTICULARLY

03:20:45.233 --> 03:20:47.101
FROM PARENTS WERE IMMIGRANTS

03:20:47.168 --> 03:20:48.936
WHO DO CORN MONOLINGUAL SPANISH

SPEAKERS WHO ARE SAYING THAT

03:20:50.405 --> 03:20:52.907
THEY ARE INTIMIDATED BY THE

03:20:52.974 --> 03:20:53.474
SYSTEM AND BY THEIR SERVICE

03:20:53.541 --> 03:20:54.809
COORDINATORS. SO WE HAVE TO

03:20:54.876 --> 03:20:55.910
HAVE WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE

03:20:55.977 --> 03:20:57.412
CULTURE WE HAVE TO HAVE

03:20:57.478 --> 03:20:59.013
DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS AND BY

03:21:59.674 --> 03:22:01.843
THE SYSTEM- WITHOUT GOOD

COMMENT I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE

03:22:15.957 --> 03:22:17.525
SUBCOMMITTEE TO SEE IF YOU HAVE

03:22:17.592 --> 03:22:19.760
ANY QUESTIONS- I'D LIKE TO

03:22:19.827 --> 03:22:21.796
BEGIN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

03:22:21.863 --> 03:22:25.233
IF I MAY AND- THE LA- HAD.

03:22:25.299 --> 03:22:26.701
BROUGHT UP THAT THERE IS A RISK

03:22:26.767 --> 03:22:30.471
OF. FEDERAL FUNDING OF BEING

03:22:30.538 --> 03:22:31.873
OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE

03:22:31.939 --> 03:22:34.041
CASELOAD RATIO STANDARDS AND

03:22:34.108 --> 03:22:34.675
WAS HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON

03:22:34.742 --> 03:22:38.079
THAT. YES THANK YOU- I'M I'LL

03:22:38.145 --> 03:22:40.348
GO AHEAD AND PROVIDED OF

03:22:40.414 --> 03:22:41.749
RESPONSE AND THEN I HAVE MY

03:22:41.816 --> 03:22:43.451
TECHNICAL EXPERT WHO JUST JOIN

03:22:43.518 --> 03:22:47.922
ME HERE. DEPUTY DIRECTOR- BUT

03:22:47.989 --> 03:22:49.991
AS I DO WANT TO JUST MAKE NOTE

03:22:50.057 --> 03:22:52.126
THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME SHIFT

03:22:52.193 --> 03:22:55.429
AS FAR AS HOW CMS EVALUATES AND

03:22:55.496 --> 03:22:56.697
MEASURES COMPLIANCE WITH THE

03:22:56.764 --> 03:22:59.367
FEDERAL WAIVER. AND THERE WAS A

03:22:59.433 --> 03:23:01.168
TIME WHEN AND CERTAINLY IT THE

03:23:01.235 --> 03:23:02.703
MISS WOULDN'T HAD OUTLINED THE

03:23:02.770 --> 03:23:05.039
TIME WHEN WE HAD A FINDING AND

03:23:05.106 --> 03:23:06.974
THAT THE PLAN OF CORRECTION AND

03:23:07.041 --> 03:23:08.442
THE RESPONSE THAT ULTIMATELY

03:23:08.509 --> 03:23:10.177
LED INTO STATUTE IS TO KEESLER

03:23:10.244 --> 03:23:13.514
RATIOS. BUT RIGHT NOW- CMS IS

03:23:13.581 --> 03:23:15.516
USING DATA THAT AS I SAID

03:23:15.583 --> 03:23:16.918
THERE'S A CHANGE THAT'S

03:23:16.984 --> 03:23:18.920
OCCURRING NATIONALLY AND CMS IS

03:23:18.986 --> 03:23:21.522
ALSO MAKING THAT SHIFT AS WELL.

03:23:21.589 --> 03:23:23.391
AND SO THE MEASURE THEY USE

03:23:23.457 --> 03:23:25.426
PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO ASSESS

03:23:25.493 --> 03:23:27.662
COMPLIANCE WITH H. CBS WAIVER

03:23:27.728 --> 03:23:29.363
ONE OF THE MEASURES IS NOT

03:23:29.430 --> 03:23:32.433
RATIOS- HOWEVER THEY DO TAKE A

03:23:32.500 --> 03:23:33.968
LOOK AT WHAT OF THOSE OUTCOMES

03:23:34.035 --> 03:23:36.504
AND SO THERE'S- JUST A KIND OF

03:23:36.571 --> 03:23:39.073
LINK THE TWO PROPOSALS TOGETHER

03:23:39.140 --> 03:23:42.176
BETWEEN. THE CASELOAD RATIO

03:23:42.243 --> 03:23:43.911
HERE BUT THEN ALSO THE QUESTION

03:23:43.978 --> 03:23:45.780
IS TO COMPLIANCE SO WE TAKE A

03:23:45.846 --> 03:23:47.114
LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE AND

03:23:47.181 --> 03:23:49.884
SAID TO PROGRAM IN BEING ABLE

03:23:49.951 --> 03:23:51.619
TO USE THE RESOURCES THAT WE

03:23:51.686 --> 03:23:53.387
HAVE WITHIN STATUTE TO HAVE THE

03:23:53.454 --> 03:23:55.289
ALTERNATIVE STAFFING MODEL THAT

03:23:55.356 --> 03:23:57.258
COULD BE PRESENTED. BY STILL

03:23:57.325 --> 03:23:59.060
HAVING REGIONAL CENTERS USE SO

03:23:59.126 --> 03:24:01.662
STRATEGIES THAT THEY IDENTIFIED

03:24:01.729 --> 03:24:02.163
TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE

03:24:02.229 --> 03:24:03.030
INDIVIDUALS. BUT SHE

03:24:03.097 --> 03:24:04.799
PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT GETS

03:24:04.865 --> 03:24:07.101
TO THOSE OUTCOMES ACTUALLY IS A

03:24:07.168 --> 03:24:08.769
TIED TO COMPLIANCE WITH THE H.

03:24:08.836 --> 03:24:12.039
CBS FEDERAL FUNDING- SO IT AND

03:24:12.106 --> 03:24:14.241
ALL IF MISTER KNIGHT HAS ANY

03:24:14.308 --> 03:24:15.576
ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ELEMENTS

03:24:15.643 --> 03:24:20.948
OF IT THAT MIGHT BE HELP. MANY

03:24:21.015 --> 03:24:23.084
YES THANK YOU JIM WITH THAT. OF

03:24:23.150 --> 03:24:24.885
THE SERVICES SO JUST TO ADD A

03:24:24.952 --> 03:24:25.686
BIT MORE. UNDER OF THE PER

03:24:25.753 --> 03:24:28.055
MEASURES THAT CMS REQUIRES NOW

03:24:28.122 --> 03:24:29.957
HE REALLY IS DIRECTOR BARGE MEN

03:24:30.024 --> 03:24:30.958
SAID LOOKING AT SOME OF THE

03:24:31.025 --> 03:24:32.560
RESULTS IF YOU WILL OF CASE

03:24:32.627 --> 03:24:34.795
MANAGEMENT AS OPPOSED TO- A

03:24:34.862 --> 03:24:37.398
RATIO SO FOR INSTANCE- CASE

03:24:37.465 --> 03:24:40.034
MANAGERS ARE REQUIRED IN IN IN

03:24:40.101 --> 03:24:41.335
TO DO A TINY REVIEW OF

03:24:41.402 --> 03:24:42.803
INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM PLANS MAKING

03:24:42.870 --> 03:24:44.438
SURE THEY'RE UPDATED WHEN.

03:24:44.505 --> 03:24:46.240
NEEDS CHANGE AND THE LIKE AND

03:24:46.307 --> 03:24:47.742
ALSO IF THEY REFLECT-

03:24:47.808 --> 03:24:48.909
INDIVIDUALS HEALTH AND SAFETY

03:24:48.976 --> 03:24:50.478
NEEDS SO IT'S THOSE KIND OF

03:24:50.544 --> 03:24:52.613
MEASURES NOW THAT CMS LOOKS TO

03:24:52.680 --> 03:24:54.682
AND THAT WE REPORT ON. EVERY

03:24:54.749 --> 03:24:56.517
FIVE YEARS TO AND TO SEE A

03:24:56.584 --> 03:24:58.786
MASS. AND IN THAT THOSE

03:24:58.853 --> 03:24:59.954
PERFORMANCE MEASURES WHAT'S

03:25:00.021 --> 03:25:03.357
USED IN TO EVALUATE OUR

03:25:03.424 --> 03:25:04.725
COMPLIANCE WITH THE WAIVER. IS

03:25:04.792 --> 03:25:06.093
IT POSSIBLE THAT THOSE ARE

03:25:06.160 --> 03:25:09.797
DIRECTLY RELATED TO WORKLOAD.

03:25:09.864 --> 03:25:13.434
THE PERFORMANCE OF. THE THOSE

03:25:13.501 --> 03:25:15.002
WHO ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE

03:25:15.069 --> 03:25:19.340
TIMELY REVIEWS. THIS THIS IS

03:25:19.407 --> 03:25:21.642
NANCY SO WITH THERE'S ALWAYS

03:25:21.709 --> 03:25:23.344
TIES TO WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES

03:25:23.411 --> 03:25:25.246
YOU KNOW AND YOU TO BE ABLE TO

03:25:25.312 --> 03:25:27.782
SAY EXACTLY WHAT ARE THOSE

03:25:27.848 --> 03:25:29.617
OUTCOMES AND- CLEARLY WITHIN

03:25:29.684 --> 03:25:30.818
THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE

03:25:30.885 --> 03:25:32.586
PROGRAM WE'RE IDENTIFYING A

03:25:32.653 --> 03:25:34.855
NEED. THAT HAS TO DEVELOP A

03:25:34.922 --> 03:25:36.223
READINESS TO ACHIEVE

03:25:36.290 --> 03:25:39.060
PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND SO THE

03:25:39.126 --> 03:25:40.661
FIRST YEAR OF BEING ABLE TO

03:25:40.728 --> 03:25:42.596
IDENTIFY THERE IS A COMMENT

03:25:42.663 --> 03:25:44.465
THAT ALSO TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW

03:25:44.532 --> 03:25:45.766
WHAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY AND ITS

03:25:45.833 --> 03:25:47.068
ITS TECHNOLOGY IS NOT GOING TO

03:25:47.134 --> 03:25:49.370
REPLACE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW SO YOU

03:25:49.437 --> 03:25:50.771
HAVE TO REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT

03:25:50.838 --> 03:25:51.706
WHAT ARE THE KIND OF THE

03:25:51.772 --> 03:25:53.874
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO BE ABLE

03:25:53.941 --> 03:25:55.309
TO ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMES FOR THE

03:25:55.376 --> 03:25:58.679
INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE. AND WITH

03:25:58.746 --> 03:26:00.548
THE REDUCE THAT THE CASE LOW

03:26:00.614 --> 03:26:01.615
FOR THE THREE FOUR AND FIVE

03:26:01.682 --> 03:26:02.883
YEAR OLDS WITH THE PERFORMANCE

03:26:02.950 --> 03:26:04.018
INCENTIVE PROGRAM WHERE

03:26:04.085 --> 03:26:05.152
REGIONAL CENTERS. COULD

03:26:05.219 --> 03:26:07.621
IDENTIFY THAT THEIR PRIORITY OR

03:26:07.688 --> 03:26:08.489
THE WAY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

03:26:08.556 --> 03:26:09.957
BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THOSE AREAS

03:26:10.024 --> 03:26:11.726
BECAUSE THEY'RE- THEY'RE NOT

03:26:11.792 --> 03:26:13.861
ACHIEVING THEM TODAY MAYBE TO

03:26:13.928 --> 03:26:15.196
HIRE EX NUMBER SERVICE

03:26:15.262 --> 03:26:16.797
COORDINATORS OR IT MAY BE EX

03:26:16.864 --> 03:26:18.199
NUMBER SERVICE COORDINATORS

03:26:18.265 --> 03:26:19.567
PLUS EMPLOYMENT SPECIALIST

03:26:19.633 --> 03:26:21.502
PUSHED. PLUS THE HEALTH PLANS

03:26:21.569 --> 03:26:23.137
SPECIALISTS PLUS SO THEY THEY

03:26:23.204 --> 03:26:26.207
CAN REALLY USE. THE FLEXIBILITY

03:26:26.273 --> 03:26:29.477
AND TO NAVIGATING IT AS OPPOSED

03:26:29.543 --> 03:26:31.212
TO A PRESCRIPTIVE. BECAUSE A

03:26:31.278 --> 03:26:34.081
PRESCRIPTIVE APPROACH MAY NOT

03:26:34.148 --> 03:26:36.016
BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR

03:26:36.083 --> 03:26:37.885
EVERY COMMUNITY AND WE HAVE

03:26:37.952 --> 03:26:38.586
TWENTY ONE DIFFERENT REGIONAL

03:26:38.652 --> 03:26:40.654
CENTERS THAT RUBRIC REPRESENT.

03:26:40.721 --> 03:26:42.823
A MULTIPLE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT

03:26:42.890 --> 03:26:48.863
COMMUNITIES. I THINK MY CONCERN

03:26:48.929 --> 03:26:50.965
IF I CAN JUST VOICE OUT LOUD

03:26:51.031 --> 03:26:54.602
IS- THE RISK REALLY HERE TO

03:26:54.668 --> 03:26:55.836

PERIOD OF TIME AND SO WE WOULD

03:32:32.673 --> 03:32:35.042
NOT RELY ON THAT INCREASED

03:32:35.109 --> 03:32:37.778

A REDUCTION OF EMERGENCY

03:34:42.736 --> 03:34:44.338
DEPARTMENT VISITS EMERGENCY

ARE LIVING AT THE HOME. SO OUR

03:34:53.480 --> 03:34:55.115
PROPOSAL INCLUDES- FOR

03:34:55.182 --> 03:34:56.483
ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT WE

03:34:56.550 --> 03:34:58.518
WOULD LIKE TO START UP IN OTHER

03:34:58.585 --> 03:35:00.587
PARTS OF THE STATE- AND I KNOW

03:35:00.654 --> 03:35:02.456
THE AGENDA. HAD NOTED THE AND

03:35:02.522 --> 03:35:03.357
THE LA ALWAYS ASK SOME

03:35:03.423 --> 03:35:04.958
QUESTIONS AS TO WHERE WOULD WE

03:35:05.025 --> 03:35:07.694
IDENTIFY THOSE- OUR STRATEGY TO

03:35:07.761 --> 03:35:10.063
IDENTIFY. THOSE AREAS IN WHICH

03:35:10.130 --> 03:35:12.332
WE WOULD PRIORITIZE IS LOOKING

03:35:12.399 --> 03:35:14.134
IN AND THE THERE'S A MAP IN THE

03:35:14.201 --> 03:35:15.769
AGENDA THAT GIVES YOU A

03:35:15.836 --> 03:35:18.705
REFERENCE TO WHERE WE HAVE OUR-

03:35:18.772 --> 03:35:22.075
CRISIS- A Q. CRISIS SERVICES

03:35:22.142 --> 03:35:23.543
BOTH ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE

03:35:23.610 --> 03:35:24.911
AND THEN OUR CAST WHICH IS

03:35:24.978 --> 03:35:26.480
STATE OPERATED. WHICH IS A

03:35:26.546 --> 03:35:28.315
MOBILE TEAM AND THEN ALSO

03:35:28.382 --> 03:35:29.616
IDENTIFYING WHERE WE HAVE

03:35:29.683 --> 03:35:31.885
OTHERS THE START SERVICES SO WE

03:35:31.952 --> 03:35:33.053
WOULD BE LOOKING AT THOSE

03:35:33.120 --> 03:35:34.288
REGIONAL CENTER CATCHMENT AREAS

03:35:34.354 --> 03:35:36.056
THAT DON'T HAVE EITHER OF THOSE

03:35:36.123 --> 03:35:38.158
RESOURCES. SO WE CAN REALLY DO

03:35:38.225 --> 03:35:39.126
A COMPLIMENT THROUGHOUT THE

03:35:39.192 --> 03:35:41.361
STATE AND START BALANCING SOME

03:35:41.428 --> 03:35:43.297
OF THOSE RESOURCES WHAT'S NICE

03:35:43.363 --> 03:35:44.097
ABOUT HAVING A MULTIPLE

03:35:44.164 --> 03:35:46.266
APPROACH WE CAN START SEEN WHAT

03:35:46.333 --> 03:35:48.068
IS THIS. WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE

03:35:48.135 --> 03:35:49.436
TELLING US AND SOME BEST

03:35:49.503 --> 03:35:51.938

DIRECTOR BY IN MAY IN REAL TO

03:36:04.284 --> 03:36:04.818
THE BUILDING I OF COULD PASS A

03:36:04.885 --> 03:36:07.020
POOR SO TREAT PROGRAM NOTING

03:36:07.087 --> 03:36:08.255
THE SENSE OF BUILDING OUT

03:36:08.322 --> 03:36:10.590
CAPACITY- AT THE DEVELOPMENTAL

03:36:10.657 --> 03:36:12.492
CENTER HOWEVER WE DO FEEL THAT

03:36:12.559 --> 03:36:14.127
FOLKS WOULD BE BETTER SERVED AT

03:36:14.194 --> 03:36:15.295
PORTER BILL RATHER THAN COUNTY

03:36:15.362 --> 03:36:16.963
JAIL IS THE RATIONALE BEHIND

03:36:17.030 --> 03:36:18.565
THAT AND THE TEMPORARY NATURE

03:36:18.632 --> 03:36:19.800
OF BUILDING OUT THE TWENTY BET

03:36:19.866 --> 03:36:22.269
UNIT AND SECONDARILY JUST THE

03:36:22.336 --> 03:36:23.870
WITH THE SAFETY NET PLAN IN THE

03:36:23.937 --> 03:36:25.439
CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING

03:36:25.505 --> 03:36:27.107
NOTING THAT THE SAFETY NET PLAN

03:36:27.174 --> 03:36:28.942
TRADITIONALLY AS REFLECTED MORE

03:36:29.009 --> 03:36:31.011
BUILDING OUT CAPACITY- THIS IS

03:36:31.078 --> 03:36:31.845
REALLY FOCUSED ON A

03:36:31.912 --> 03:36:33.814
PREVENTATIVE ASPECT WHICH IS A

03:36:33.880 --> 03:36:36.783
POSITIVE STEP FORWARD THANK

03:36:36.850 --> 03:36:40.087
YOU. THANK YOU SIR. SO YOU PICK

03:36:40.153 --> 03:36:42.989
FROM THE LA. WE WANT TO. A FEW.

03:36:43.056 --> 03:36:45.392
A THIS NET. PLAN THAT HAS BEEN

03:36:45.459 --> 03:36:46.660
PUT FORWARD BY THE DEPARTMENT

03:36:46.727 --> 03:36:48.829
AND THEN TALK ABOUT THE TO-

03:36:48.895 --> 03:36:51.031
SPECIFIC PROPOSALS. SO WE KNOW

03:36:51.098 --> 03:36:52.366
WHAT A SEVERAL THINGS THAT WE

03:36:52.432 --> 03:36:54.835
FOUND- VERY HELPFUL ABOUT THE

03:36:54.901 --> 03:36:56.103
PLAN THAT WAS DELIVERED ON

03:36:56.169 --> 03:36:58.505
JANUARY TENTH- FIRST IT

03:36:58.572 --> 03:37:00.006
PROVIDED HELPFUL UPDATES ABOUT

03:37:00.073 --> 03:37:01.074
THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE ALREADY

03:37:01.141 --> 03:37:04.111
BEEN FUNDED- IT PROVIDED AS-

03:37:04.177 --> 03:37:05.779
SORT OF HOLISTIC LOOK AT THE

03:37:05.846 --> 03:37:08.248
VARIOUS SERVICES. AND SUPPORTS

03:37:08.315 --> 03:37:09.950
ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE-

03:37:10.016 --> 03:37:11.952
IT PROVIDED A DESCRIPTION OF IT

03:37:12.018 --> 03:37:14.254
THE NEW FOCUS ON PREVENTION AS

03:37:14.321 --> 03:37:15.389
MY COLLEAGUE FROM FINANCE JUST

03:37:15.455 --> 03:37:18.158
MENTIONED- YOU KNOW AS WE KNOW

03:37:18.225 --> 03:37:19.960
PREVENTION PREVENTION OF CRISES

03:37:20.026 --> 03:37:21.061
IS BETTER FOR THE INDIVIDUAL

03:37:21.128 --> 03:37:22.295
BETTER FOR THE FAMILY BETTER

03:37:22.362 --> 03:37:23.797
FOR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND

03:37:23.864 --> 03:37:26.066
IT'S LESS COSTLY- IT ALSO

03:37:26.133 --> 03:37:27.667
PROVIDES GREAT CONTEXT ON THE

03:37:27.734 --> 03:37:29.436
CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE

03:37:29.503 --> 03:37:30.871
PERSON'S SERVED INCLUDING THE

03:37:30.937 --> 03:37:32.639
GROWING RATES OF AUTISM AND CO

03:37:32.706 --> 03:37:34.207
OCCURRING. MENTAL HEALTH.

03:37:34.274 --> 03:37:37.944
ATTACHED ISSUES- IT ALSO

03:37:38.011 --> 03:37:39.112
PRESENTS SOME OF THE GOALS THAT

03:37:39.179 --> 03:37:40.480
WERE DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION

03:37:40.547 --> 03:37:41.815
WITH STAKEHOLDERS WHICH IS

03:37:41.882 --> 03:37:43.850
IMPORTANT. BUT WE DO FIND THAT

03:37:43.917 --> 03:37:45.819
THE PLAN DOES- LACKS CERTAIN

03:37:45.886 --> 03:37:47.788
SPACES SPECIFICITY IN A FEW

03:37:47.854 --> 03:37:49.990
AREAS- PRIMARILY IT DOESN'T

03:37:50.056 --> 03:37:51.391
REALLY PROVIDE A PLAN THAT

03:37:51.458 --> 03:37:53.493
LOOKS FORWARD IT'S AS SOMEWHAT

03:37:53.560 --> 03:37:55.862
MORE OF A STATUS UPDATE- IT

03:37:55.929 --> 03:37:57.697
WOULD BE GREAT. IF THE PLAN HAD

03:37:57.764 --> 03:38:00.500
SOME HAD. OF NOT ONLY THE OVER

03:38:00.567 --> 03:38:01.802
ARCHING GOALS THAT ARE IN THE

03:38:01.868 --> 03:38:03.603
PLAN BUT BUT SPECIFIC GOALS

03:38:03.670 --> 03:38:05.572
WITH MEASURABLE TARGETS- THAT

03:38:05.639 --> 03:38:06.773
THE DEPARTMENT HOPES TO

03:38:06.840 --> 03:38:08.942
ACHIEVE- THE ACTIVITIES THAT

03:38:09.009 --> 03:38:10.477
THE DEPARTMENT WOULD UNDERTAKE

03:38:10.544 --> 03:38:11.878
TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS AND HOW

03:38:11.945 --> 03:38:12.746
THEY WILL KNOW THAT THOSE

03:38:12.813 --> 03:38:17.184
VARIOUS EFFORTS ARE SUCCESSFUL.

03:38:17.250 --> 03:38:18.652
OR WHETHER THEY NEED REFINEMENT.

03:38:18.718 --> 03:38:19.252
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A

03:38:19.319 --> 03:38:21.154
DISK OF HOW DATA IS USED TO

03:38:21.221 --> 03:38:22.756
MAKE THESE DECISIONS- THE

03:38:22.823 --> 03:38:24.124
DEPARTMENT PROVIDES A LOT OF

03:38:24.191 --> 03:38:25.325
GREAT DATA ABOUT THIS

03:38:25.392 --> 03:38:27.761
POPULATION- AND THEIR VARIOUS

03:38:27.828 --> 03:38:29.596
NEEDS BUT WE DON'T QUITE KNOW

03:38:29.663 --> 03:38:32.399
HOW THOSE- THAT INFORMATION

03:38:32.466 --> 03:38:35.202
TRANSLATES INTO THESE REQUESTS

03:38:35.268 --> 03:38:37.204
THAT COME FORWARD EACH YEAR-

03:38:37.270 --> 03:38:38.705
AND THEN IT WOULD BE GREAT TO

03:38:38.772 --> 03:38:39.739
HAVE AN EXPLANATION OF HOW

03:38:39.806 --> 03:38:40.774
CERTAIN PROJECTS ARE

03:38:40.841 --> 03:38:43.877
PRIORITIZED OVER OTHERS AND SO

03:38:43.944 --> 03:38:45.145
WITHOUT SORT OF KNOWING HOW

03:38:45.212 --> 03:38:46.613
THOSE DECISIONS ARE MADE IT'S

03:38:46.680 --> 03:38:48.148
DIFFICULT ON A YEAR BY YEAR

03:38:48.215 --> 03:38:51.718

COUNTY JAIL OR IN A JAIL THAT

03:41:17.530 --> 03:41:18.832
THERE IS SO MUCH MORE

03:41:18.898 --> 03:41:20.433
COLLABORATION IN THAT IS NEEDED

03:41:20.500 --> 03:41:22.502
BETWEEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND

BUT RIGHT NOW THIS IS-

03:41:26.940 --> 03:41:30.710

A REALLY THINK THAT WE CONTINUE

03:41:40.487 --> 03:41:41.888
TO NEED TO LOOK OUTSIDE THE

03:41:41.955 --> 03:41:43.390
SYSTEM OF JUSTICE THE HOUSE.

03:41:43.456 --> 03:41:45.458
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF. GOOD

03:41:45.525 --> 03:41:47.360
MEDICAL SERVICES AVAILABLE TO

03:41:47.427 --> 03:41:49.763

BEGINS TO HAPPEN AROUND

INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE

03:42:05.278 --> 03:42:06.513
PREVIOUSLY IN DEVELOPMENTAL

03:42:06.579 --> 03:42:08.181
CENTERS. I CURRENTLY SERVE

03:42:08.248 --> 03:42:09.883
FOLKS IN SUPPORT OF LIVING THAT

03:42:09.949 --> 03:42:11.518
LEFT THE COMMUNITY CRISIS HOME.

03:42:11.584 --> 03:42:13.119
SO I THINK WE NEED TO START

03:42:13.186 --> 03:42:13.853
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION

03:42:13.920 --> 03:42:14.888
BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO SUIT

03:42:14.954 --> 03:42:16.122
SUPPORTED LIVING. AND YOU

03:42:16.189 --> 03:42:18.091
PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT THERE'S NO

03:42:18.158 --> 03:42:19.926
NEED TO MOVE ON. THE SUPPORT

03:42:19.993 --> 03:42:21.294
STAYS WHERE IT'S AT I AM IN

AND THE FAMILIES GET THE

03:42:24.531 --> 03:42:26.733
SUPPORT IN THE HOME. YOU BEGIN

03:42:26.800 --> 03:42:28.334
TO MITIGATE A LOT OF THOSE WHEN

03:42:28.401 --> 03:42:30.403
FAMILIES CAN HAVE THAT ENHANCE

03:42:30.470 --> 03:42:31.871
SUPPORT AND SERVICES. IN A

03:42:31.938 --> 03:42:34.140
CRISIS SITUATION I JUST THINK

03:42:34.207 --> 03:42:35.642
THE SAME THING NEEDS TO HAPPEN

03:42:35.709 --> 03:42:37.343
IN OUR ADULT COMMUNITY SO THEY

03:42:37.410 --> 03:42:40.613
DON'T END UP NEEDING. THE

03:42:40.680 --> 03:42:41.614
SERVICES OF A C. C. H. S. OR

03:42:41.681 --> 03:42:44.484
AND B. S. C. H. BUT IF WE CAN

03:42:44.551 --> 03:42:46.953
FOR. A WHOLE. A TO PEOPLE IN.

03:42:47.020 --> 03:42:49.556
WHERE THEY LIVE. THAT MAYBE WE

03:42:49.622 --> 03:42:50.857
BEGIN TO MOVE THE SYSTEM FOR IN

03:42:50.924 --> 03:42:56.129
A MUCH. MORE PROGRESSIVE. THANK

03:42:56.196 --> 03:42:59.499
YOU MA'AM. I'M ALISON MARIE

03:42:59.566 --> 03:43:03.136
DISABILITY YOU KNOW. I SO I

03:43:03.203 --> 03:43:04.003
THINK ALL THREE INCH COME ARE

03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:06.339
INTEREST AND THE FIRST TWO I A

03:43:06.406 --> 03:43:09.809
WHOLE AGREE WITH LA- THAT IF

03:43:09.876 --> 03:43:11.745
THE ALTERNATIVE IS JAIL- WHICH

03:43:11.811 --> 03:43:14.013
IT OFTEN IS- THIS IS AN

03:43:14.080 --> 03:43:15.849
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY CRITICAL

03:43:15.915 --> 03:43:18.885
AN OVERDUE STEP- PEOPLE WITH ID

03:43:18.952 --> 03:43:20.987
DE HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING IN

03:43:21.054 --> 03:43:22.355
REGULAR JAILS IT'S A HORRIBLE

03:43:22.422 --> 03:43:24.724
PLACE TO BE- THEY ARE

03:43:24.791 --> 03:43:26.226
VULNERABLE THEIR RISK IN THOSE

03:43:26.292 --> 03:43:27.627
SETTINGS AND SO I THINK

03:43:27.694 --> 03:43:29.529
ALTHOUGH CLEARLY I WHOLE

03:43:29.596 --> 03:43:31.064
HEARTEDLY WITH THE LAST YOU

03:43:31.131 --> 03:43:31.998
KNOW THE LAST COM IS IMPORTANT

03:43:32.065 --> 03:43:33.133
I MEAN WE WANT TO PROVIDE

03:43:33.199 --> 03:43:34.701
PREVENTION IS CRITICAL. BUT TO

03:43:34.768 --> 03:43:35.702
THE EXTENT THAT PEOPLE ARE

03:43:35.769 --> 03:43:39.272
READY CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVED.

03:43:39.339 --> 03:43:41.074
YOU KNOW TEMPORARILY MAKING

03:43:41.141 --> 03:43:41.908
ADDITIONAL SPACE AVAILABLE IN

03:43:41.975 --> 03:43:43.209
PORTER VEIL AND BUILDING OUT

03:43:43.276 --> 03:43:45.645
THE CAPACITY IN THE COMMUNITY.

03:43:45.712 --> 03:43:47.447
MAKES TOTAL SENSE AND IS SO

03:43:47.514 --> 03:43:50.116
IMPORTANT- SO I THINK THOSE TWO

03:43:50.183 --> 03:43:52.752
PIECES ARE OURS AGIN LONG

03:43:52.819 --> 03:43:55.388
OVERDUE. I THINK ON THE START

03:43:55.455 --> 03:43:57.857
PROGRAM- IT IT CERTAINLY SEEMS

03:43:57.924 --> 03:44:00.126
VERY PROMISING- AND IT HAS BEEN

03:44:00.193 --> 03:44:02.195
TRIED IN OTHER STATES WHICH IS

03:44:02.262 --> 03:44:03.797
A GOOD THING- BUT I DO THINK

03:44:03.863 --> 03:44:05.265
THIS IS A REALLY GREAT EXAMPLE

03:44:05.331 --> 03:44:06.666
OF WHY INDEPENDENT EVALUATION

03:44:06.733 --> 03:44:08.968
IS SO IMPORTANT- BECAUSE AFTER

03:44:09.035 --> 03:44:10.270
ALL CALIFORNIA'S DIFFERENT IN

03:44:10.336 --> 03:44:11.538
SO MANY WAYS SOME OF WHICH

03:44:11.604 --> 03:44:12.338
WE'VE DISCUSSED IN THIS

03:44:12.405 --> 03:44:14.007
HEARING. ON THE FACT THAT IT'S

03:44:14.073 --> 03:44:15.441
WORKED IN OTHER STATES WELL IS

03:44:15.508 --> 03:44:17.143
VERY ENCOURAGING AND I THINK

03:44:17.210 --> 03:44:20.380
THE STATISTICS- THAT DIRECTOR

03:44:20.446 --> 03:44:21.714
BIRDMAN CITED ARE ALSO

03:44:21.781 --> 03:44:23.983
ENCOURAGING BUT MY CONCERN IS

03:44:24.050 --> 03:44:25.318
THAT THOSE ARE NOT REALLY A

03:44:25.385 --> 03:44:26.686
SUBSTITUTE FOR INDEPENDENT

03:44:26.753 --> 03:44:29.556
EVALUATION WHY- WELL IN PART

03:44:29.622 --> 03:44:30.356
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

03:44:30.423 --> 03:44:32.325
OTHER THINGS ARE GOING ON WITH

03:44:32.392 --> 03:44:32.992
THESE FAMILIES THAT ARE

03:44:33.059 --> 03:44:34.828
INCLUDED. RIGHT EVEN IF THEIR

03:44:34.894 --> 03:44:36.729
RATES ARE GOING DOWN IT COULD

03:44:36.796 --> 03:44:38.398
BE THAT AS A RESULT OF THIS

03:44:38.464 --> 03:44:39.899
INTERVENTION THEY'RE GETTING

03:44:39.966 --> 03:44:41.067
OTHER KINDS OF INTERVENTION

03:44:41.134 --> 03:44:42.135
THEY'RE ACCESSING GENERIC

03:44:42.202 --> 03:44:43.670
RESOURCES THEY'RE ACCESSING

03:44:43.736 --> 03:44:44.938
BETTER MEDICAL CARE. AND THAT

03:44:45.004 --> 03:44:45.905
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THIS

03:44:45.972 --> 03:44:47.407
INTERVENTION PER SE THAT'S

03:44:47.473 --> 03:44:49.108
HELPING THEM BUT THE OTHER

03:44:49.175 --> 03:44:50.310
THINGS THAT ARE COMING TO THEM

03:44:50.376 --> 03:44:52.212
AT THE SAME TIME- I DON'T KNOW

03:44:52.278 --> 03:44:53.379
I DON'T KNOW EITHER WAY BUT I

03:44:53.446 --> 03:44:54.781
THINK IT THIS IS A PERFECT

03:44:54.848 --> 03:44:56.583
EXAMPLE OF WHY. SORT OF

03:44:56.649 --> 03:44:57.884
ENABLING AND THERE'S DIFFERENT

03:44:57.951 --> 03:44:59.018
WAYS TO ENABLE INDEPENDENT

03:44:59.085 --> 03:45:00.753
EVALUATION IT COULD BE MAKING

03:45:00.820 --> 03:45:02.455
THE DATA AVAILABLE AND DE

03:45:02.522 --> 03:45:03.590
IDENTIFIED FORM SO THAT THE

03:45:03.656 --> 03:45:05.258
RESEARCH COMMUNITY WHICH IS

03:45:05.325 --> 03:45:07.694
ROBUST IN LARGE IN CALIFORNIA-

03:45:07.760 --> 03:45:08.728
YOU KNOW CAN ANALYZE AND SEE IS

03:45:08.795 --> 03:45:09.829
IT REALLY THIS INTERVENTION OR

03:45:09.896 --> 03:45:10.797
OTHER THINGS ARE HAPPENING AND

03:45:10.864 --> 03:45:12.432
SAME TIME. BUT I THINK WE NEED

03:45:12.498 --> 03:45:13.633
TO KNOW BECAUSE OF THIS IS

03:45:13.700 --> 03:45:15.568
GONNA BE REPLICATED IN OTHER-

03:45:15.635 --> 03:45:17.303
REGIONAL CENTERS IS IT SEEMS IT

03:45:17.370 --> 03:45:19.105
WILL BE. WE NEED TO KNOW

03:45:19.172 --> 03:45:19.806
WHETHER THERE'S A CAUSAL

03:45:19.873 --> 03:45:21.207
RELATIONSHIP WHETHER IT'S

03:45:21.274 --> 03:45:22.342
CORRELATIONAL AND WHETHER WHAT

03:45:22.408 --> 03:45:23.576
WE'VE ENCOURAGING THINGS WE'VE

03:45:23.643 --> 03:45:24.777
SEEN IN OTHER STATES ARE

03:45:24.844 --> 03:45:26.412
ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN HERE IN

03:45:26.479 --> 03:45:29.382
CALIFORNIA AS WELL. THANK YOU.

03:45:29.449 --> 03:45:34.187
YOU KATIE HARDER DISABILITY CAL.

03:45:34.254 --> 03:45:37.090
ON WE HAVE A CONCERN THAT THERE.

03:45:37.156 --> 03:45:38.992
OF THE BED CAP THAT PORTER FELL.

03:45:39.058 --> 03:45:40.793
ON NEED UP BE NASA. AND

03:45:40.860 --> 03:45:42.462
CERTAINLY MAY NOT BE NECESSARY

03:45:42.528 --> 03:45:43.796
FOR THE DURATION. OF THE

03:45:43.863 --> 03:45:45.298
WRITTEN IN THE TRAILER BILL

03:45:45.365 --> 03:45:46.833
CURRENTLY. AND THAT'S BECAUSE

03:45:46.900 --> 03:45:48.434
IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT

03:45:48.501 --> 03:45:49.569
THERE ARE PEOPLE AT.

03:45:49.636 --> 03:45:50.403
PORTERFIELD DEVELOPMENTAL

03:45:50.470 --> 03:45:52.005
CENTER WHO MAY BE READY TO

03:45:52.071 --> 03:45:54.107
TRANSITION TO THE COMMUNITY.

03:45:54.173 --> 03:45:55.675
AND NEED A COMMUNITY PLACEMENT.

03:45:55.742 --> 03:45:59.779
ON FOUND FOR THEM. BOB WE ALSO-

03:45:59.846 --> 03:46:01.981
BELIEVE THAT IF WE WERE TO LOOK

03:46:02.048 --> 03:46:05.018
AT ALIGNING THE I. D. D.

03:46:05.084 --> 03:46:07.020
DIVERSION STATUTES TO THE

03:46:07.086 --> 03:46:09.088
MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION STATUTE

03:46:09.155 --> 03:46:10.857
THAT COULD REDUCE OUR JAIL

03:46:10.924 --> 03:46:13.960
POPULATION. M. M. ALSO IN TERMS

03:46:14.027 --> 03:46:17.497
OF. THE RESOURCES FOR OUR I. S.

03:46:17.563 --> 03:46:19.966
TEAS- IN PREVIOUS YEARS THE

03:46:20.033 --> 03:46:22.936
LEGISLATURE HAD. INCLUDED

03:46:23.002 --> 03:46:25.605
COMMUNITY BED SPECIFICALLY FOR

03:46:25.672 --> 03:46:26.739
PEOPLE IN THE I. S. T.

03:46:26.806 --> 03:46:29.642
SITUATION AND UNFORTUNATELY-

03:46:29.709 --> 03:46:31.010
GIVEN COMPETING DEMANDS ON

03:46:31.077 --> 03:46:32.078
THEIR ATTENTION THE DEPARTMENT

03:46:32.145 --> 03:46:33.246
DIDN'T PRIORITIZE THAT

03:46:33.313 --> 03:46:34.881
DEVELOPMENT. AND SO

03:46:34.948 --> 03:46:36.616
PRIORITIZING THAT DEVELOPMENT

03:46:36.683 --> 03:46:38.651
COULD ALSO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF

03:46:38.718 --> 03:46:40.286
TIME THAT THE EXPANSION

03:46:40.353 --> 03:46:41.354
IMPORTER BILL MIGHT WELL BE

03:46:41.421 --> 03:46:43.589
NECESSARY. THE OTHER THING IN

03:46:43.656 --> 03:46:45.725
REGARDS TO THE- FIVE ADDITIONAL

TEAMS AND REALLY SUPPORT THOSE

03:46:54.968 --> 03:46:56.903
PLACEMENTS AND FIND THEM TO BE

03:46:56.970 --> 03:46:58.571
VERY EFFECTIVE FOR OUR CLIENTS.

03:46:58.638 --> 03:47:01.407
HOWEVER WE HAVE TO CAPS RUNNING

03:47:01.474 --> 03:47:03.009
AND WE REALLY NEED TO ALIGN

03:47:03.076 --> 03:47:05.111
THOSE CAPS PARTICULARLY IF

03:47:05.178 --> 03:47:08.414
WE'RE LOOKING AT INCREASING ON

03:47:08.481 --> 03:47:09.415
THOSE THOSE BEDS IN THIS YEAR.

03:47:09.482 --> 03:47:13.486
THANK YOU GIVE. AMY WESTLING

03:47:17.357 --> 03:47:18.691
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

03:47:18.758 --> 03:47:20.960
IN THIS AREA WE UNDERSTAND THAT

03:47:21.027 --> 03:47:23.596
THERE ARE ACTUALLY IN EXCESS OF

03:47:23.663 --> 03:47:24.931
TWENTY PEOPLE CURRENTLY WAITING

03:47:24.998 --> 03:47:25.431
TO GET INTO A PORTABLE

03:47:25.498 --> 03:47:26.966
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER SO WE VIEW

03:47:27.033 --> 03:47:30.036
THIS AS- UNNECESSARY START TO

03:47:30.103 --> 03:47:31.704
MEETING THEIR NEEDS OF COURSE

03:47:31.771 --> 03:47:34.507

COULD SAY ONE THING. IT I- IT

04:02:12.818 --> 04:02:14.419
WAS VERY TOUCHING HERE THE

04:02:14.486 --> 04:02:15.821
PARENTS BECAUSE WE DO RESPITE

04:02:15.888 --> 04:02:19.691
TOUGH. AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND

04:02:19.758 --> 04:02:21.193
THAT THE SYSTEM IS UNDERFUNDED

04:02:21.260 --> 04:02:22.828
BELIEVE ME WE JUST HAD AN

04:02:22.895 --> 04:02:24.496
EMERGENCY MEETING AT OUR AGENCY

04:02:24.563 --> 04:02:27.232
BECAUSE WE LOST MONEY- SO THIS

04:02:27.299 --> 04:02:30.736
CRISIS GOES ON AND ON. SO AND I

04:02:30.802 --> 04:02:31.870
UNDERSTAND THE SENTIMENT OF

04:02:31.937 --> 04:02:35.140
SOME SERVICE PROVIDERS IT SAY.

04:02:35.207 --> 04:02:37.576
WE IT'S CHANGED IT'S RIDICULOUS

04:02:37.643 --> 04:02:40.279
TO TALK ABOUT SERVICE OUTCOMES-

04:02:40.345 --> 04:02:43.215
WHEN WE CAN'T EVEN GET STAFF I

04:02:43.282 --> 04:02:46.785
UNDERSTAND THAT SENTIMENT. BUT

04:02:46.852 --> 04:02:48.387
I THINK THAT THAT'S A

04:02:48.453 --> 04:02:50.822
MISPERCEPTION OF OUR PROPOSAL.

04:02:50.889 --> 04:02:52.124
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SERVICE

04:02:52.190 --> 04:02:54.092
OUTCOMES SERVICE DELIVERY

04:02:54.159 --> 04:02:56.561
OUTCOMES RIGHT- WE TALK ABOUT

04:02:56.628 --> 04:02:57.562
MEASURING THEM WE'RE NOT

04:02:57.629 --> 04:02:59.131
TALKING ABOUT BEATING UP

04:02:59.197 --> 04:03:00.465
SERVICE PROVIDERS A CAN'T MAKE

04:03:00.532 --> 04:03:02.367
THEM THE SERVICING THAT'S

04:03:02.434 --> 04:03:04.002
THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE WE SHOULD

04:03:04.069 --> 04:03:05.971
BE MEASURING HOW THE IMPACT OF

04:03:06.038 --> 04:03:07.506
THE UNDER FUNDED SYSTEM AFFECTS

04:03:07.572 --> 04:03:10.409
QUALITY WE CAN'T DO THAT.

04:03:10.475 --> 04:03:12.611
WITHOUT DETERMINING SERVICE

04:03:12.678 --> 04:03:15.013
DELIVER QUALITY SO. A WEEK WE

04:03:15.080 --> 04:03:16.348
CAN'T EVEN IF WE DON'T EVEN

04:03:16.415 --> 04:03:18.116
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS HOW CAN WE

04:03:18.183 --> 04:03:19.651
TALK ABOUT THE EFFECT ON PEOPLE

04:03:19.718 --> 04:03:21.086
WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES%

04:03:21.153 --> 04:03:22.754
IN AN UNDERFUNDED SYSTEM AND

04:03:22.821 --> 04:03:24.222
THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS SO

04:03:24.289 --> 04:03:25.357
THAT WHEN THERE'S OF WHEN

04:03:25.424 --> 04:03:28.026
THERE'S A CRISIS IN FUNDING-

04:03:28.093 --> 04:03:30.362
IT'S EASY TO CUT. THIS THE

04:03:30.429 --> 04:03:31.630
BUDGET LIKE IT HAPPENED IN THE

04:03:31.697 --> 04:03:32.731
LAST GREAT RECESSION RIGHT

04:03:32.798 --> 04:03:34.099
WHERE THEY JUST CUT IT BY FOUR

04:03:34.166 --> 04:03:36.368
POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT-

04:03:36.435 --> 04:03:38.503
BECAUSE- WE COULDN'T

04:03:38.570 --> 04:03:40.539
DEMONSTRATE. WHAT THE IMPACT OF

04:03:40.605 --> 04:03:42.774
THAT WAS AND SO I THINK IT'S

04:03:42.841 --> 04:03:44.676
REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

04:03:44.743 --> 04:03:47.646
THAT THIS INITIATIVE IS NOT

04:03:47.713 --> 04:03:50.349
ABOUT. A IGNORING THE RATE

04:03:50.415 --> 04:03:52.384
STUDY OR IGNORING UNDERFUNDED-

04:03:52.451 --> 04:03:54.820
NATURE OF OUR SYSTEM. THANK YOU

04:03:57.489 --> 04:03:58.991

PROPOSAL RAISES A BIGGER- ISSUE

04:18:26.257 --> 04:18:27.992
IN THE SYSTEM AND THAT IS THE

04:18:28.059 --> 04:18:29.493

ARE ADDITIONAL STATES THAT

THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS AT

04:18:48.379 --> 04:18:50.248

DISABILITIES- FOR CONTEXT. I

04:18:54.819 --> 04:18:56.187

WHATEVER WORK IS BEING DONE SO

04:19:14.171 --> 04:19:16.941
ULTIMATELY THIS COMES DOWN TO-

04:19:17.008 --> 04:19:17.975
SORT OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL

DID DO A SELECTION OF SOME

04:31:47.691 --> 04:31:49.559
ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS AND THE

04:31:49.626 --> 04:31:51.495
REASON WE DID THAT THE FIRST

04:31:51.561 --> 04:31:52.129
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOLKS SO WE

04:31:52.195 --> 04:31:54.831
CHOSE THERE WERE A NUMBER ABOUT

04:31:54.898 --> 04:31:55.565
FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY OF

04:31:55.632 --> 04:31:57.567
THOSE INITIAL TWENTY FIVE

04:31:57.634 --> 04:31:58.635
HUNDRED HAD CHOSEN NOT TO

04:31:58.702 --> 04:32:00.137
CONTINUOUS SELF DETERMINATION

04:32:00.203 --> 04:32:02.205
SO WE DID SELECT SOME

04:32:02.272 --> 04:32:05.308
ADDITIONAL FOLKS- TO CONTINUE.

04:32:05.375 --> 04:32:08.211
TO REPLACE THOSE FOLKS. AS OF

04:32:08.278 --> 04:32:10.013
MARCH SECOND SO JUST THIS

04:32:10.080 --> 04:32:12.616
MONDAY- WE HAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY

04:32:12.683 --> 04:32:13.684
FOLKS THAT OF IT THAT HAVE

04:32:13.750 --> 04:32:14.951
ACTUALLY NOW STARTED WITH SELF

04:32:15.018 --> 04:32:16.086
DETERMINATION MOVING HAVE A

04:32:16.153 --> 04:32:17.821
BUDGET IN IRAQ AND- PURCHASING

04:32:17.888 --> 04:32:21.758
THEIR SERVICES- THROUGH THAT-

04:32:21.825 --> 04:32:24.227
SOME OTHER- THINGS TO NOTE. YOU

04:32:24.294 --> 04:32:25.262
KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS

04:32:25.328 --> 04:32:28.799
HAS- BEEN A CONCERN. IS THE

04:32:28.865 --> 04:32:30.167
DELAY IN THE TIME BETWEEN THE

04:32:30.233 --> 04:32:31.868
SELECTION AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE

04:32:31.935 --> 04:32:33.637
GETTING STARTED. WHAT ONE OF

04:32:33.704 --> 04:32:36.540
THE ISSUES HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP

04:32:36.606 --> 04:32:38.775
IS THAT THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

04:32:38.842 --> 04:32:41.611
AMOUNT OF SUPPORT THAT MAY BE-NEEDED IN BETWEEN THE TIME TO

04:32:41.678 --> 04:32:43.113
REALLY GET STARTED. I MEAN IF

04:32:43.180 --> 04:32:44.047
WE THINK ABOUT IT WE TALKED

04:32:44.114 --> 04:32:45.248
ABOUT IT BEFORE THAT IN SOME

04:32:45.315 --> 04:32:46.683
CASES IT'S ALMOST LIKE SETTING

04:32:46.750 --> 04:32:48.585
UP A BUSINESS FOR SOME FOLKS.

04:32:48.652 --> 04:32:49.619
NEED TO FIGURE OUT A HIGHER

04:32:49.686 --> 04:32:51.421
FOLKS WHO TO HIRE HOW MUCH TO

04:32:51.488 --> 04:32:53.623
PAY THEM HOW DO I USE ALL THIS

04:32:53.690 --> 04:32:57.594
MONEY- AND THAT'S JUST. A MAN.

04:32:57.661 --> 04:32:59.930
THE SMALL PART OF IT. RIGHT SO

04:32:59.996 --> 04:33:00.997
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT-

04:33:01.064 --> 04:33:03.133
THE STATUE DID ALLOW FOR WAS TO

04:33:03.200 --> 04:33:04.668
USE SOME OF THE- THE SAVINGS

04:33:04.735 --> 04:33:07.771
THAT W- WE- REALIZED. BECAUSE

04:33:07.838 --> 04:33:08.872
OF THE FOLKS AROUND THE OLD

04:33:08.939 --> 04:33:10.307
PILOT PROJECT HAVE NOW MOVED

04:33:10.373 --> 04:33:12.242
INTO SELF DETERMINATION. SOME

04:33:12.309 --> 04:33:13.610
OF THAT FUNDING COULD BE USED

04:33:13.677 --> 04:33:15.245
TO HELP SUPPORT FOLKS IN THEIR

04:33:15.312 --> 04:33:16.546
TRANSITION AND HELP THE

04:33:16.613 --> 04:33:17.981
IMPLEMENTATION. OF SELF

04:33:18.048 --> 04:33:19.282
DETERMINATION TO THOSE FUNDS

04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:21.384
HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED. TO BE USED

04:33:21.451 --> 04:33:25.288
BY- WITH THE- COLLABORATION AND

04:33:25.355 --> 04:33:27.023
JUST DECIDING IN COLLABORATION

04:33:27.090 --> 04:33:28.125
WITH THE LOCAL ADVISORY

04:33:28.191 --> 04:33:29.059
COMMITTEES IN THE REGIONAL

04:33:29.126 --> 04:33:30.794
CENTERS. ON HOW TO USE THAT

04:33:30.861 --> 04:33:32.162
FUNDING TO HELP SUPPORT THAT

04:33:32.229 --> 04:33:34.197
IMPLEMENTATION IN TRANSITION.

04:33:34.264 --> 04:33:36.733
SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HELP-

04:33:36.800 --> 04:33:39.236
SUPPORT FOLKS TO TRANSITION AND

04:33:39.302 --> 04:33:41.638
DO ALL THAT UP FRONT WORK THAT

04:33:41.705 --> 04:33:43.640
THAT REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN

04:33:43.707 --> 04:33:45.575
BECAUSE IN. WE REALLY WANT TO

04:33:45.642 --> 04:33:47.043
RECOGNIZE AND IS AGAIN THE

04:33:47.110 --> 04:33:48.245
FUNDING THAT WENT OUT IN THE

04:33:48.311 --> 04:33:49.880
GUIDANCE TO WIN OUT. STRESSES

04:33:49.946 --> 04:33:51.515
THAT THAT THE DECISION ON THE

04:33:51.581 --> 04:33:52.616
USE OF THOSE FUNDS NEED TO BE

04:33:52.682 --> 04:33:53.984
IN COLLABORATION WITH THE LOCAL

04:33:54.050 --> 04:33:55.852
ADVISORY COMMITTEES. BECAUSE

04:33:55.919 --> 04:33:57.988
IT'S- THE WORK OF THOSE CAN'T

04:33:58.054 --> 04:33:59.256
THE LOCAL COMMITTEE AS WELL AS

04:33:59.322 --> 04:33:59.990
THE STATE RIGHT ADVISORY

04:34:00.056 --> 04:34:00.891
COMMITTEE IS GOING TO BE VERY

04:34:00.957 --> 04:34:02.459
IMPORTANT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD

04:34:02.526 --> 04:34:07.597
THE OVERSIGHT AND- PROGRESS IN

04:34:07.664 --> 04:34:11.735
THE PROGRAM. SO THERE ARE A

04:34:11.802 --> 04:34:12.803
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AS I

04:34:12.869 --> 04:34:14.171
MENTIONED THAT WERE PRESENTED

04:34:14.237 --> 04:34:15.572
IN THE AGENDA AND I'LL GO

04:34:15.639 --> 04:34:17.974
THROUGH A FEW OF THOSE- INTO

04:34:18.041 --> 04:34:19.209
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS ABOUT

04:34:19.276 --> 04:34:20.710
THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO CHOSE

04:34:20.777 --> 04:34:22.012
NOT TO CONTINUE AS I MENTIONED

04:34:22.078 --> 04:34:23.747
IT'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY

04:34:23.814 --> 04:34:26.983
WHICH IS ABOUT 23% OVERALL. ONE

04:34:27.050 --> 04:34:27.851
THING THAT WE DID WHEN WE

04:34:27.918 --> 04:34:28.985
LOOKED AT THOSE FOLKS WHO CHOSE

04:34:29.052 --> 04:34:31.421
NOT TO CONTINUE- BLACKS IN TO

04:34:31.488 --> 04:34:32.956
TAKE A STEP BACK WHEN WE DID

04:34:33.023 --> 04:34:35.025
THE INITIAL SELECTION OF TWENTY

04:34:35.091 --> 04:34:35.892
FIVE HUNDRED FOLKS AS WELL AS

04:34:35.959 --> 04:34:38.595
THE- WHEN WE FILLED IN BEHIND

04:34:38.662 --> 04:34:40.897
WE WANTED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE

04:34:40.964 --> 04:34:42.299
REPRESENTATION OF THE STATE NOT

04:34:42.365 --> 04:34:44.034
ONLY WHERE FOLKS LIVE BUT

04:34:44.100 --> 04:34:47.170
CERTAINLY- ALONG WITH-

04:34:47.237 --> 04:34:50.941
ETHNICITY AND RACIAL GROUPS. SO

04:34:51.007 --> 04:34:52.042
WHEN WE LOOK TO THE FOLKS WHO

04:34:52.108 --> 04:34:54.511
HAD CHOSEN NOT TO CONTINUE THE

04:34:54.578 --> 04:34:56.713
ETHNICITY AND RACIAL MAKE UP OF

04:34:56.780 --> 04:34:58.014
THAT GROUP THAT CHOSE NOT TO

04:34:58.081 --> 04:34:59.916
CONTINUE ACTUALLY MIRRORS THE

04:34:59.983 --> 04:35:01.685
POPULATION AT LARGE SO WE

04:35:01.751 --> 04:35:04.187
DIDN'T SEE ANY DIFFERENCES ARE

04:35:04.254 --> 04:35:06.890
OUTSTANDING- YOU KNOW WARRANTED

04:35:06.957 --> 04:35:08.358
MORE IN ONE AREA THAN ANOTHER

04:35:08.425 --> 04:35:09.826
SO THAT THAT WAS ONE THING THAT

04:35:09.893 --> 04:35:11.094
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

04:35:11.161 --> 04:35:13.263
TOOK A LOOK AT. IT WITHIN EACH

04:35:13.330 --> 04:35:14.331
REGIONAL CENTER THERE CERTAINLY

04:35:14.397 --> 04:35:16.066
WAS A VARIANCE IN THAT THE

04:35:16.132 --> 04:35:17.067
PERCENTAGE OF FOLKS WHO CHOSE

04:35:17.133 --> 04:35:18.602
NOT TO CONTINUE ITS GET THE TO

04:35:18.668 --> 04:35:20.804
RANGE OF BETWEEN 11% OF THE

04:35:20.871 --> 04:35:23.406
FOLKS SELECTED UP 253% AND

04:35:23.473 --> 04:35:24.608
THERE'S SOME REASONS FOR SOME

04:35:24.674 --> 04:35:27.978
OF THAT SOME OF THE REGIONAL

04:35:28.044 --> 04:35:30.614
CENTERS. IN THE- THE

04:35:30.680 --> 04:35:32.215
INFORMATIONAL MEETINGS THAT

04:35:32.282 --> 04:35:33.550
FOLKS WERE REQUIRED TO GET SOME

04:35:33.617 --> 04:35:34.784
INFORMATION ABOUT SELF

04:35:34.851 --> 04:35:36.720
DETERMINATION BEFORE THEY- GOT

04:35:36.786 --> 04:35:37.888
ON THE LIST TO BE CONSIDERED

04:35:37.954 --> 04:35:39.990
FOR SELECTION. SOME OF THAT WAS

04:35:40.056 --> 04:35:40.790
DONE IN A IN A MUCH BROADER

04:35:40.857 --> 04:35:44.060
WAY- AND- IN SO SOME OF THE

04:35:44.127 --> 04:35:45.495
FOLKS AND THAT WERE SELECTED IN

04:35:45.562 --> 04:35:48.231
THOSE REGIONAL CENTERS- MAYBE

04:35:48.298 --> 04:35:49.799
WORKED AS QUOTE. THE MAYBE

04:35:49.866 --> 04:35:51.334
WEREN'T AS INTERESTED IN IN

04:35:51.401 --> 04:35:52.769
GOING FORWARD AT LEAST AT THIS

04:35:52.836 --> 04:35:54.905
TIME. IN SELF DETERMINATION AS

04:35:54.971 --> 04:35:56.072
MAYBE IN SOME OF THE OTHERS

04:35:56.139 --> 04:35:58.141
WHERE THERE IS MORE ROBUST-

04:35:58.208 --> 04:36:00.577
INFORMATION THAT WAS SHARED AND

04:36:00.644 --> 04:36:01.077
FOLKS THAT THAT HAD MORE

04:36:01.144 --> 04:36:03.613
INFORMATION BUT WE ALSO THEN

04:36:03.680 --> 04:36:06.383
WANT TO LEARN THOUGH- ABOUT.

04:36:06.449 --> 04:36:08.184
WHY IT IS THAT THOSE FOLKS-

04:36:08.251 --> 04:36:10.120
CHOSE NOT TO CONTINUE THEIR-

04:36:10.186 --> 04:36:11.755
AND SO WE DID SEND OUT A SURVEY

04:36:11.821 --> 04:36:16.059
THAT WAS HELPED- DEVELOPED BY-

04:36:16.126 --> 04:36:17.260
OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH

04:36:17.327 --> 04:36:18.528
STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING ADVISORY

04:36:18.595 --> 04:36:21.164
GROUP. WE SENT THAT OUT TO ALL

04:36:21.231 --> 04:36:22.532
FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOLKS. WHO

04:36:22.599 --> 04:36:24.668
CHOSE NOT TO CONTINUE SO FAR

04:36:24.734 --> 04:36:26.069
WE'VE RECEIVED EIGHTY EIGHT

04:36:26.136 --> 04:36:27.537
RESPONSES BACK WE'RE OBVIOUSLY

04:36:27.604 --> 04:36:28.805
HOPING TO GET SOME MORE WE'RE

04:36:28.872 --> 04:36:30.006
GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEND THOSE

04:36:30.073 --> 04:36:33.743
OUT- AS- OTHER FOLKS- CHOOSE

04:36:33.810 --> 04:36:35.845
NOT TO CONTINUE AS WELL. AND WE

04:36:35.912 --> 04:36:38.081
pIF THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT WE

04:36:38.148 --> 04:36:39.149
CAN LEARN FROM FOLKS WHO HAVE

04:36:39.215 --> 04:36:41.551
BEEN- WHO HAVE BEEN SELECTED IN

04:36:41.618 --> 04:36:43.253
CHOSEN NOT TO CONTINUE. IS

04:36:43.320 --> 04:36:44.554
THERE SOME WAY THAT WE CAN HELP

04:36:44.621 --> 04:36:45.855
MAKE IT EASIER FOR FOLKS TO

04:36:45.922 --> 04:36:47.490
UNDERSTAND OR WHATEVER IT IS

04:36:47.557 --> 04:36:50.927
THAT WE CAN LEARN. TO HELP-

04:36:50.994 --> 04:36:54.497
PROGRESS TO THE PROGRAM. ALSO

04:36:54.564 --> 04:36:56.433
ANOTHER COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND

04:36:56.499 --> 04:36:58.301
ABOUT PERSON CENTER PLANS AN

04:36:58.368 --> 04:36:59.135
OBVIOUS AS I MENTIONED IN THE

04:36:59.202 --> 04:37:00.937
LAST ISSUE PERSON CENTERED

04:37:01.004 --> 04:37:01.805
PLANNING AND THINKING IS

04:37:01.871 --> 04:37:03.773
OBVIOUSLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

04:37:03.840 --> 04:37:05.208
THERE HAVE BEEN TWO HUNDRED

04:37:05.275 --> 04:37:05.775
NINETY ONE INDIVIDUALS THAT

04:37:05.842 --> 04:37:07.377
HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO HAVE GONE

04:37:07.444 --> 04:37:08.311
TO THAT PERSON CENTERED

04:37:08.378 --> 04:37:10.213
PLANNING PROCESS SO FAR AND

04:37:10.280 --> 04:37:12.916
AGAIN WE'LL KEEP- DATED AND BE

04:37:12.983 --> 04:37:13.917
ABLE TO COLLECT DATA ON THAT

04:37:13.984 --> 04:37:15.452
MONTHLY IS BEING REPORTED BY

04:37:15.518 --> 04:37:16.720
THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THEN

04:37:16.786 --> 04:37:18.621
ALSO WE CAN- VERIFY IN SOME

04:37:18.688 --> 04:37:20.724
CASES THAT SOME OF THOSE THAT

04:37:20.790 --> 04:37:21.858
THAT PERSON CENTERED PLANNING

ANY WORK WE'RE CREATING

04:38:08.004 --> 04:38:09.472
SOMETHING THAT'S NEW. EVEN

04:38:09.539 --> 04:38:11.775
THOUGH WE'VE HAD PILOTS- WE

04:38:11.841 --> 04:38:14.577
THIS IS NEW STATEWIDE- AND

04:38:14.644 --> 04:38:17.213
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME- SOME OF

04:38:17.280 --> 04:38:19.849
THOSE HAVE BEEN AS A RESULT OF-

04:38:19.916 --> 04:38:21.518
THAT THAT. THE TIME THAT IT

04:38:21.584 --> 04:38:23.186
TOOK QUITE HONESTLY TO GET.

04:38:23.253 --> 04:38:24.421
THIS APPROVED FOR FEDERAL

04:38:24.487 --> 04:38:26.623
FUNDING. SEVERAL YEARS AGO IT

04:38:26.689 --> 04:38:29.759
WAS NOT UNFORTUNATELY UNUSUAL.

04:38:29.826 --> 04:38:30.693
FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

04:38:30.760 --> 04:38:32.395
TAKE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME

04:38:32.462 --> 04:38:33.897
TO GO AFTER AN APPLICATION FOR

04:38:33.963 --> 04:38:36.866
FUNDING WAS- PRESENTED TO THEM

04:38:36.933 --> 04:38:38.068
TO DO SOME APPROVALS THAT DID

04:38:38.134 --> 04:38:39.636
TAKE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

04:38:39.702 --> 04:38:41.905
TIME. FOR US TO DO THAT. AND

04:38:41.971 --> 04:38:44.340
THEN THERE WAS A DELAY-

04:38:44.407 --> 04:38:45.975
ACTUALLY AFTER WE DID OUR

04:38:46.042 --> 04:38:48.078
SELECTION. UNTIL WE ACTUALLY

04:38:48.144 --> 04:38:49.245
START WE'RE ABLE TO START THE

04:38:49.312 --> 04:38:51.247
ORIENTATION SO THAT FOLKS CAN

04:38:51.314 --> 04:38:55.151
GET STARTED- YOU KNOW IN

04:38:55.218 --> 04:38:57.087
HINDSIGHT. WE WEREN'T QUITE

04:38:57.153 --> 04:38:58.855
READY FOR THE ORIENTATIONS WHEN

04:38:58.922 --> 04:39:00.023
WE DID THE SELECTION AND I

04:39:00.090 --> 04:39:01.491
THINK THAT DID CREATE SOME.

04:39:01.558 --> 04:39:03.526
SOME SOME ANGST AMONGST FOLKS

04:39:03.593 --> 04:39:06.196
AND SO YOU KNOW. IF WE WERE TO

04:39:06.262 --> 04:39:08.064
HAVE A CHANCE TO DO IT AGAIN WE

04:39:08.131 --> 04:39:08.865
WOULD DO THINGS A LITTLE BIT

04:39:08.932 --> 04:39:13.002
DIFFERENTLY- AND- SO THERE'S

04:39:13.069 --> 04:39:16.539
ALSO. YOU KNOW INFORMATION I

04:39:16.606 --> 04:39:17.740
THINK IS BETTER ARE A REQUEST

FOR THAT. IN A LOT OF THAT I

04:39:19.609 --> 04:39:20.810

THINGS MAYBE ARE GOING RIGHT

04:39:25.648 --> 04:39:27.083
BUT ALSO LEARNING FROM FOLKS

04:39:27.150 --> 04:39:28.985

04:39:29.052 --> 04:39:30.286

WITH THE CAN THAT'S COME OUT

04:58:30.692 --> 04:58:31.159
SOME OF OUR TESTIMONY SO I

04:58:31.226 --> 04:58:33.428
THINK. IF WE'RE STRIVING FOR

04:58:33.495 --> 04:58:35.264
UNIFORM SYSTEM WE MIGHT WANT TO

04:58:35.330 --> 04:58:36.531
CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY AS

04:58:36.598 --> 04:58:37.332
LONG AS WE'RE HAVING A

04:58:37.399 --> 04:58:39.134
CONVERSATION ALREADY ABOUT

04:58:39.201 --> 04:58:41.937
OUTCOMES MEASURING OUTCOMES- I

04:58:42.004 --> 04:58:43.939
THINK SELF DETERMINATION IS AN

04:58:44.006 --> 04:58:44.640
EXCELLENT CANDIDATE FOR AN

04:58:44.706 --> 04:58:46.642
OUTCOME MEASURE. NOW OF COURSE

04:58:46.708 --> 04:58:47.676
THAT NEEDS TO BE THOUGHTFULLY

04:58:47.743 --> 04:58:48.610
CONSIDERED WE CAN HAVE THE

04:58:48.677 --> 04:58:49.778
OUTCOME BE HOW MANY PEOPLE

04:58:49.845 --> 04:58:51.213
CHOOSE TO GO INTO SELF DID IT

04:58:51.280 --> 04:58:52.314
RIGHT I MEAN THERE'S AN OUTCOME

04:58:52.381 --> 04:58:53.515
MEASURES THE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY

04:58:53.582 --> 04:58:56.852

04:58:56.918 --> 04:58:58.954
OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS ROLE

04:58:59.021 --> 04:59:01.657
IN. MAXIMIZING THE OPPORTUNITY

04:59:01.723 --> 04:59:02.791
FOR PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

SELF DETERMINATION BUT THERE'S

04:59:03.925 --> 04:59:05.160
CONSIDERABLE VARIATION ALONG

04:59:05.227 --> 04:59:06.495
THAT DIMENSION ACROSS THE STATE

04:59:06.561 --> 04:59:08.030
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. I THINK

04:59:08.096 --> 04:59:09.298
WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT WE

04:59:09.364 --> 04:59:11.166
SHOULD THINK ABOUT AGAIN HOW TO

MEASURE IT AND HOW TO

04:59:11.933 --> 04:59:13.402
INCENTIVIZE IT. SO THAT WE

04:59:13.468 --> 04:59:15.604
REALLY EQUALIZE OPPORTUNITY FOR

04:59:15.671 --> 04:59:17.172

QUESTIONS TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

05:07:21.823 --> 05:07:24.192
REGARDING SOME OF THE MEASURES-

05:07:24.259 --> 05:07:26.528
THAT WE- HAVE THAT HAVE BEEN-

05:07:26.594 --> 05:07:30.698
USED TO- DO THE TRACKING OF THE

DO THAT BUT I DO WANT TO JUST

05:07:39.307 --> 05:07:40.608
SPEAK TO SOME OF IMPORTANT

05:07:40.675 --> 05:07:42.010
ITEMS THAT. WHISPERED I DON'T

05:07:42.076 --> 05:07:43.611
MIND WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR THE

05:07:43.678 --> 05:07:46.848
LAST- I'D SAY THE LAST FOUR

05:07:46.915 --> 05:07:49.017
YEARS- BUT CERTAINLY IDENTIFIED

05:07:49.083 --> 05:07:51.586
IT EARLIER IN REALLY ADDRESSING

05:07:51.653 --> 05:07:53.221
THE ISSUE AND RECOGNIZING THAT

05:07:53.288 --> 05:07:56.024
THE DIFFERENCE IN THE DISPARITY

05:07:56.090 --> 05:07:57.192
BETWEEN FINDING BETWEEN OUR

05:07:57.258 --> 05:07:59.227
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND THE

05:07:59.294 --> 05:08:01.796
WHITE COMMUNITY AND REALLY

05:08:01.863 --> 05:08:03.431
UNDERSTANDING THE DATA ONE OF

05:08:03.498 --> 05:08:04.999
THE THINGS IT'S BEEN REALLY

05:08:05.066 --> 05:08:06.701
IMPORTANT IS NOT ONLY WITH THE

05:08:06.768 --> 05:08:07.936
WORK THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS

05:08:08.002 --> 05:08:09.537
IT AND DOING IT AND THAT I YOU

05:08:09.604 --> 05:08:10.338
WAITING THAT PURCHASE SERVICE

05:08:10.405 --> 05:08:12.473
DATA OF AND WE'VE RECOGNIZED

05:08:12.540 --> 05:08:16.611
OVER TIME ONE OF THE THINGS YOU

05:08:16.678 --> 05:08:17.245
NEED TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

05:08:17.312 --> 05:08:17.879
THAT THE DATE THAT THE REASON

05:08:17.946 --> 05:08:19.547
CENTERS ARE USED AT THE LOCAL

05:08:19.614 --> 05:08:22.584
LEVEL. GOOD WERE USING STATE

05:08:22.650 --> 05:08:25.520
LAW THAT WE ABLE TO STAND UP

05:08:25.587 --> 05:08:27.488
BUT ALSO AN OPEN THAT WE PANTS

05:08:27.555 --> 05:08:29.257
THAT ARE CAME ALSO UNDERSTANDS

05:08:29.324 --> 05:08:30.825
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE

05:08:30.892 --> 05:08:36.231
ALSO DOING IN A M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; SENT OF&lt;/c&gt;</u>

05:08:36.297 --> 05:08:40.702
WITH OF OUR THERE'S A WAS SOME

05:08:40.768 --> 05:08:42.370
PLACE TO LOOK AT THE DATA IS TO

05:08:42.437 --> 05:08:44.105
SAY HOW CAN BE SURE THAT NOT

05:08:44.172 --> 05:08:46.140
ONLY IS THAT ABOUT PEOPLE AND

05:08:46.207 --> 05:08:48.476
THEIR MACHINE READABLE FORMAT

05:08:48.543 --> 05:08:51.179
BUT HOW IS IT EASILY. AND SO

05:08:51.246 --> 05:08:54.215
CAN WITH THE TO SEE THAT WOULD

05:08:54.282 --> 05:08:57.118
WANT TO DO A MAY SURE EACH WERE

05:08:57.185 --> 05:09:01.956
ON SAID IN STATE THAT THE PER A

05:09:02.023 --> 05:09:04.425
SURVEY DAY IT IS IT GOING BE

05:09:04.492 --> 05:09:09.097
JUST HEARING OTHERS THAT WILL

05:09:09.163 --> 05:09:13.468
IN. WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS

05:09:13.534 --> 05:09:15.270
AND IT WENT TO REGIONAL CENTER-

05:09:15.336 --> 05:09:17.405
OPERATIONS AND TO BE ABLE TO

05:09:17.472 --> 05:09:19.340
CONTRACT OR TO DELIVER

05:09:19.407 --> 05:09:21.042
DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES TO

05:09:21.109 --> 05:09:22.710
IT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE WE

05:09:22.777 --> 05:09:24.579
PIVOTED OVER TO A GRANT PROGRAM

05:09:24.646 --> 05:09:27.048
THE SECOND YEAR AND THAT GRANT

05:09:27.115 --> 05:09:28.116
PROGRAM ALLOWED US TO BE ABLE

05:09:28.182 --> 05:09:30.618
TO- DISTRIBUTE MONEY TO

05:09:30.685 --> 05:09:32.787
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

05:09:32.854 --> 05:09:33.588
AND THAT WAS REALLY AN

05:09:33.655 --> 05:09:35.523
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE LOCAL

05:09:35.590 --> 05:09:37.792
COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO-

05:09:37.859 --> 05:09:39.794
INTRODUCE NEW IDEAS DIFFERENT

05:09:39.861 --> 05:09:41.596
PRACTICES AND START EXPANDING

05:09:41.663 --> 05:09:43.097
THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES

05:09:43.164 --> 05:09:44.198
THAT COULD REALLY BREAK DOWN

05:09:44.265 --> 05:09:46.401
THOSE BARRIERS AND HELP

05:09:46.467 --> 05:09:48.569
FAMILIES NAVIGATE SERVICES. SO

05:09:48.636 --> 05:09:50.171
IN DOING THAT WE STARTED SEEING

05:09:50.238 --> 05:09:52.140
MUCH OF THE PROGRAMS THAT- HAD

05:09:52.206 --> 05:09:53.641
BEEN REPLICATED THAT WE'VE BEEN

05:09:53.708 --> 05:09:55.209
ABLE TO SUPPORT WAS THE

05:09:55.276 --> 05:09:56.644
INTEREST OF EITHER THE

05:09:56.711 --> 05:09:58.346
NAVIGATORS OUR PROMO TORAS TO

05:09:58.413 --> 05:10:00.848
BE- HELPING FAMILIES- NAVIGATE

05:10:00.915 --> 05:10:02.350
THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM BUT

05:10:02.417 --> 05:10:04.752
ALSO OTHER SYSTEMS SO WE'RE IN

05:10:04.819 --> 05:10:07.221
A PLACE- WHEN WE STARTED WE

05:10:07.288 --> 05:10:10.425
USED- FIFTEEN SIXTEEN DATA-

05:10:10.491 --> 05:10:12.493
THAT GAVE US MEASURES THAT WE

05:10:12.560 --> 05:10:15.163
HAVE- MEASURES THAT WE'VE

05:10:15.229 --> 05:10:18.566
POSTED- FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW

05:10:18.633 --> 05:10:20.234
THAT WE ARE USED AND THEN I

05:10:20.301 --> 05:10:21.302
JUST WANT TO WALK YOU THROUGH

05:10:21.369 --> 05:10:23.171
THAT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE WE

05:10:23.237 --> 05:10:25.073
ARE NOW IN THE FISCAL YEAR

05:10:25.139 --> 05:10:26.374
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. IN WHICH

05:10:26.441 --> 05:10:28.409
WERE ABLE TO START IDENTIFYING

05:10:28.476 --> 05:10:30.078
WHAT ARE THE SOME OF THE

05:10:30.144 --> 05:10:32.680
OUTCOMES- THAT WERE SEEN AND

05:10:32.747 --> 05:10:35.350
OUR OUR DATA SO AND I KNOW- THE

05:10:35.416 --> 05:10:36.551
GENDER OF REFLECTS THE

05:10:36.617 --> 05:10:39.053
DISABILITY VOICES A UNITE THE

05:10:39.120 --> 05:10:41.422
AGGREGATE DATA- RECOGNIZING

05:10:41.489 --> 05:10:42.890
THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY ONE

05:10:42.957 --> 05:10:44.158
MEASURE THAT WE CAN LOOK AT ON

05:10:44.225 --> 05:10:45.927
THE AGGREGATE BUT WE ALSO KNOW

05:10:45.994 --> 05:10:47.695
THAT ON THE AGGREGATE THERE'S A

05:10:47.762 --> 05:10:49.063
LOT OF INFORMATION WE KNOW

05:10:49.130 --> 05:10:50.331
THERE'S A LOT OF RESIDENTIAL

05:10:50.398 --> 05:10:51.632
INFORMATION AND THERE WE

05:10:51.699 --> 05:10:54.202
RECOGNIZE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES

05:10:54.268 --> 05:10:55.937
OF COLOR AND DIFFERENT CULTURES

05:10:56.004 --> 05:10:57.605
MAY NOT USE- RESIDENTIAL

05:10:57.672 --> 05:11:00.308
SERVICES SO WE REALLY WANTED TO

05:11:00.375 --> 05:11:02.210
DO DRILL INTO SOME OF THE MORE.

05:11:02.276 --> 05:11:04.846
KIND OF SERVICE BASED- EXAMPLE

05:11:04.912 --> 05:11:06.047
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE

05:11:06.114 --> 05:11:08.149
THOSE BARRIERS WHAT'S OCCURRING

05:11:08.216 --> 05:11:10.118
AND HOW DO WE EFFECT CHANGE IN

05:11:10.184 --> 05:11:12.153
UNDERSTANDING THAT LEVEL OF

05:11:12.220 --> 05:11:12.887
DETAIL AND WHILE WE DON'T HAVE

05:11:12.954 --> 05:11:14.589
A POSTED YET ONE OF THE THINGS

05:11:14.655 --> 05:11:16.057
WE WANT TO DO IS TO WORK WITH

05:11:16.124 --> 05:11:17.792
THIS NEWLY FORMED DISPARITY

05:11:17.859 --> 05:11:20.128
WORK GROUP THAT WE HAVE. IS TO

05:11:20.194 --> 05:11:21.462
BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT

05:11:21.529 --> 05:11:22.563
BUT I'D LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE

05:11:22.630 --> 05:11:24.632
BIT OF THE INFORMATION- WE'RE

05:11:24.699 --> 05:11:27.969
FINDING WITH THE- THE- THE

05:11:28.036 --> 05:11:29.704
EQUITY MEASURES THAT WE HAVE.

05:11:29.771 --> 05:11:32.206
WE HAVE A LEVIN MEASURES- THAT

05:11:32.273 --> 05:11:33.941
HAVE MULTIPLE PULP POPULATIONS

05:11:34.008 --> 05:11:35.710
ETHNICITIES IF YOU WILL.

05:11:35.777 --> 05:11:37.812
THERE'S A TOTAL OF TWENTY ONE

05:11:37.879 --> 05:11:39.247
I'M INDIVIDUAL POPULATION

05:11:39.313 --> 05:11:40.882
MEASURES THAT INCLUDES WHETHER

05:11:40.948 --> 05:11:42.683
IT'S DIAGNOSIS OR OR

05:11:42.750 --> 05:11:45.219
ETHNICITIES- BASED ON THOSE

05:11:45.286 --> 05:11:47.355
MEASURES WE HAD EIGHT IMPROVED-

05:11:47.422 --> 05:11:49.223
AREAS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN

05:11:49.290 --> 05:11:50.625
THOSE MEASURES AS A COMPARISON

05:11:50.691 --> 05:11:54.262
FROM FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TO.

05:11:54.328 --> 05:11:55.363
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE HAVE TEN

05:11:55.430 --> 05:11:58.633
THAT SHOW- SHOWED NO OR SLIGHT

05:11:58.699 --> 05:12:01.135
CHANGES. AND THEN WE HAVE THREE

05:12:01.202 --> 05:12:03.671
THAT SHOWED LARGER GAPS. AND SO

05:12:03.738 --> 05:12:05.039
WHAT THIS DOES FOR US IS WERE

05:12:05.106 --> 05:12:06.741
ABLE TO NOW TAKE A LOOK INTO

05:12:06.808 --> 05:12:08.042
SOME OF THOSE AREAS OF ONE OF

05:12:08.109 --> 05:12:09.110
THE AREAS I'LL GIVE YOU AN

05:12:09.177 --> 05:12:10.311
EXAMPLE I WAS A LITTLE

05:12:10.378 --> 05:12:12.747
SURPRISED BY. IS THAT WE HAVE A

05:12:12.814 --> 05:12:14.082
SERVICE CODE THAT'S CALLED

05:12:14.148 --> 05:12:16.150
ADAPTIVE SKILLS TRAINING. AND

05:12:16.217 --> 05:12:17.251
SO WHEN WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT

05:12:17.318 --> 05:12:19.387
THE AVERAGE COST OF ADAPTIVE

05:12:19.454 --> 05:12:21.122
SKILLS TRAINING. WE DON'T HAVE

05:12:21.189 --> 05:12:22.857
ALL OF THE UNDERSTANDING AS TO

05:12:22.924 --> 05:12:24.725
WHAT TE SERVICES EXACTLY USED

05:12:24.792 --> 05:12:25.660
FOR WE'RE GOING TO BE DRILLING

05:12:25.726 --> 05:12:27.428
INTO THIS BUT ONE OF THE AREAS

05:12:27.495 --> 05:12:30.231
THAT'S USED. IS FOR A. B. A. OR

05:12:30.298 --> 05:12:31.732
BEHAVIOR TRAINING FOR

05:12:31.799 --> 05:12:33.668
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE AUTISM OR

05:12:33.734 --> 05:12:36.270
OR HIGH INTENSITY NEEDS. THIS

05:12:36.337 --> 05:12:37.238
IS A PARTICULAR AREA IN A

05:12:37.305 --> 05:12:40.074
MEASURE. THAT ACTUALLY THE WAS

05:12:40.141 --> 05:12:42.176
THE MOST MOST SIGNIFICANT

05:12:42.243 --> 05:12:43.544
DIFFERENCE THAT ACTUALLY GOT

05:12:43.611 --> 05:12:46.347
WORSE BETWEEN OUR AFRICAN

05:12:46.414 --> 05:12:48.449
AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND WHITE.

05:12:48.516 --> 05:12:50.518
PER CAPITA SPEND AND THEN THIS

05:12:50.585 --> 05:12:52.453
BI ONYX VERSUS WHITES PER

05:12:52.520 --> 05:12:54.522
CAPITA SPEND. AND SO WHEN WE

05:12:54.589 --> 05:12:56.324
LOOK AT THAT I DON'T HAVE AN

05:12:56.390 --> 05:12:58.726
ANSWER TODAY AS TO WHY THAT IS.

05:12:58.793 --> 05:13:00.461
BUT I I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF GLAD

05:13:00.528 --> 05:13:02.230
THAT WE KNOW THAT LEVEL OF

05:13:02.296 --> 05:13:04.432
DETAIL. BECAUSE WE YOU KNOW WE

05:13:04.499 --> 05:13:06.801
CAN MAKE SOME SOME ASSUMPTIONS

05:13:06.868 --> 05:13:08.336
BUT WE REALLY DO NEED TO DRILL

05:13:08.402 --> 05:13:10.204
INTO A BY REGIONAL CENTER TAKE

05:13:10.271 --> 05:13:11.038
A LOOK AT SOME OF THE

05:13:11.105 --> 05:13:12.807
INFORMATION AND SEE WHAT MAY BE

05:13:12.874 --> 05:13:14.775
THOSE DRIVERS. IS IT THAT WE

05:13:14.842 --> 05:13:17.512
HAVE. SOME INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

05:13:17.578 --> 05:13:19.046
NOT ABLE TO ACCESS GENERIC

05:13:19.113 --> 05:13:21.082
RESOURCES AND REGIONAL CENTERS

05:13:21.149 --> 05:13:22.517
MAY NOT BE FUNDING SOME OF THE

05:13:22.583 --> 05:13:24.452
A BA SERVICES UNTIL THEY GET

05:13:24.519 --> 05:13:26.320
THOSE RESOURCES. AND IS THAT

05:13:26.387 --> 05:13:27.588
IMPACT IN THE COMMUNITIES OF

05:13:27.655 --> 05:13:29.557
COLOR MORE THAN IT IS OUR WHITE

05:13:29.624 --> 05:13:32.593
COMMUNITIES SO. AGAIN I'M I'M-

05:13:32.660 --> 05:13:34.128
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT WE

05:13:34.195 --> 05:13:35.129
ARE GOING TO BE DRILLING INTO

05:13:35.196 --> 05:13:37.498
THOSE THINGS. SO AS WE CONTINUE

05:13:37.565 --> 05:13:38.833
TO WORK ON OUR EFFORTS ONE OF

05:13:38.900 --> 05:13:40.668
THE IMPORTANT- AREAS IS REALLY

05:13:40.735 --> 05:13:42.136
DRILLING INTO THE DATA THAT WE

05:13:42.203 --> 05:13:44.472
DO HAVE AVAILABLE TO US. I DO

05:13:44.539 --> 05:13:45.806
JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF

05:13:45.873 --> 05:13:47.308
NOTES TO SOME OTHER INITIATIVE

05:13:47.375 --> 05:13:48.643
BECAUSE PART OF WHAT WE WANT TO

05:13:48.709 --> 05:13:50.478
DO. IS MAKE SURE THAT ANY

05:13:50.545 --> 05:13:52.380
INITIATIVE OR POLICY THAT WERE

05:13:52.446 --> 05:13:53.648
LOOKING THROUGH IT THROUGH THE

05:13:53.714 --> 05:13:55.216
LENS OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND

05:13:55.283 --> 05:13:57.351
LINGUISTIC COMPETENCE. WE WORK

05:13:57.418 --> 05:13:59.220
WITH GEORGETOWN WE- CALIFORNIA

05:13:59.287 --> 05:14:00.488
WAS SELECTED AS ONE OF THE

05:14:00.555 --> 05:14:01.889
STATE'S TO WORK WITH GEORGETOWN

05:14:01.956 --> 05:14:03.958
UNIVERSITY. AND WE WORK WITH

05:14:04.025 --> 05:14:05.259
THE YOU SAID SINCE STATE

05:14:05.326 --> 05:14:07.962
COUNCIL AND D. R. C. YOU KNOW

05:14:08.029 --> 05:14:09.163
TO SAY HOW DO WE KIND OF BUILD

05:14:09.230 --> 05:14:11.132
OUR LEADERSHIP. AND SO THAT'S

05:14:11.199 --> 05:14:12.099
ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE

05:14:12.166 --> 05:14:14.435
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. I DO

05:14:14.502 --> 05:14:16.204
KNOW THAT PART OF WORKING WITH

05:14:16.270 --> 05:14:17.838
THE DS TASK FORCE AND THE WORK

05:14:17.905 --> 05:14:20.141
GROUPS AND TRYING TO BRING

05:14:20.208 --> 05:14:20.908
FORWARD APPLICATIONS THAT

05:14:20.975 --> 05:14:22.677
REPRESENTS OUR COMMUNITY. I

05:14:22.743 --> 05:14:24.545
HAVE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT

05:14:24.612 --> 05:14:26.981
ARE NOT REPRESENTED ON THE TASK

05:14:27.048 --> 05:14:28.716
FORCE. SO ONE OF THE AREAS THAT

05:14:28.783 --> 05:14:30.384
I REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH OUR

05:14:30.451 --> 05:14:31.852
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

05:14:31.919 --> 05:14:33.588
AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS. IS

05:14:33.654 --> 05:14:34.922
THAT WHAT ARE THOSE INITIATIVES

05:14:34.989 --> 05:14:36.390
THAT WE CAN START DEVELOPING

05:14:36.457 --> 05:14:38.659
THE SELF ADVOCATES IN THE- THE-

05:14:38.726 --> 05:14:40.027
DIFFERENT COMMUNITY LEADERS

05:14:40.094 --> 05:14:41.762
THAT WILL PARTICIPATE SO WE

05:14:41.829 --> 05:14:42.463
CAN'T HAVE A BROADER

05:14:42.530 --> 05:14:45.900
pTHAN IT WAS. BUT IT'S NOT

05:14:45.967 --> 05:14:47.368
REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR COMMUNITY

05:14:47.435 --> 05:14:49.904
AND WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT- GAPS

05:14:49.971 --> 05:14:51.205
IN THE REPRESENTATION OF THE

05:14:51.272 --> 05:14:52.607
VOICES THAT ARE AT THE TABLE

05:14:52.673 --> 05:14:54.842

05:14:54.909 --> 05:14:56.177
I'M GOING TO BE PRIORITIZING.

05:14:56.244 --> 05:14:58.145
THE REORGANIZATION IS AN AREA

05:14:58.212 --> 05:14:59.680
THAT HELPS US SO ONE OF THE

05:14:59.747 --> 05:15:00.648
THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

05:15:00.715 --> 05:15:03.384

TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION

LATINOS AFRICAN AMERICANS AND

05:16:58.999 --> 05:17:01.102
ASIAN SPACE FOR THE PAST THREE

05:17:01.168 --> 05:17:02.336
YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS

05:17:02.403 --> 05:17:03.637
APPROVED THIRTY THREE MILLION

05:17:03.704 --> 05:17:05.005
DOLLARS TO FUND REGIONAL

05:17:05.072 --> 05:17:06.240
CENTERS AND COMMUNITY BASED

05:17:06.307 --> 05:17:08.709
ORGANIZATIONS TO WORK TO READ

05:17:08.776 --> 05:17:10.478
KATE THESE DISPARITIES. LAST

YEAR DISABILITY VOICES UNITED

DESPITE THE TWENTY TWO MILLION

05:17:14.548 --> 05:17:16.384
DOLLARS SPENT DISPARITIES FOR

05:17:16.450 --> 05:17:18.085
LATINOS ACTUALLY HAD INCREASED

05:17:18.152 --> 05:17:19.387
IN TWENTY OUT OF TWENTY ONE

05:17:19.453 --> 05:17:21.655
REGIONAL CENTERS WELL NOW AFTER

05:17:21.722 --> 05:17:23.824
THREE YEARS. IN THIRTY THREE

05:17:23.891 --> 05:17:24.892
MILLION DOLLARS DISPARITIES FOR

05:17:24.959 --> 05:17:26.961
LATINOS HAVE INCREASED IN

05:17:27.027 --> 05:17:27.828
NINETEEN OF THE TWENTY ONE

05:17:27.895 --> 05:17:29.163
REGIONAL CENTERS THAT HAVE

05:17:29.230 --> 05:17:30.364
ACTUALLY STATE THE SAME INTO A

05:17:30.431 --> 05:17:33.200
THE TO REGIONAL CENTERS. EVEN

05:17:33.267 --> 05:17:34.769
THE LATINOS ARE THE LARGEST

05:17:34.835 --> 05:17:36.604
GROUP SERVED BY THE SYSTEM.

05:17:36.670 --> 05:17:38.005
THEY CONTINUE TO FACE THE

05:17:38.072 --> 05:17:39.707
GREATEST LEVEL OF DISPARITIES.

05:17:39.774 --> 05:17:41.242
AT ALMOST EVERY REGIONAL CENTER

05:17:41.308 --> 05:17:43.577
LATINOS RECEIVE NO MORE THAN

05:17:43.644 --> 05:17:45.780
HALF OF WHAT WHITES GET. AT

05:17:45.846 --> 05:17:47.248
FIVE REGIONAL CENTERS LATINOS

05:17:47.314 --> 05:17:49.283
ONLY RECEIVE A THIRD. OF WHAT

05:17:49.350 --> 05:17:50.785
WHITES RECEIVE AND THINGS SEEM

05:17:50.851 --> 05:17:52.453
TO BE WORSE AT REGIONAL CENTERS

05:17:52.520 --> 05:17:54.722
WHERE THE LATINO POPULATION IS

05:17:54.789 --> 05:17:57.324
THE LARGEST. WE APPRECIATE THAT

05:17:57.391 --> 05:17:58.659
THE DIRECTOR BARGE BEEN HAS

05:17:58.726 --> 05:18:00.561
MADE THIS ISSUE SUCH A PRIORITY

05:18:00.628 --> 05:18:02.563
AND HAS ENGAGE GRASSROOTS

05:18:02.630 --> 05:18:04.165
ORGANIZATIONS TO REACH DEEP

05:18:04.231 --> 05:18:05.933
INTO THESE COMMUNITIES. TO

05:18:06.000 --> 05:18:07.868
BRING TO THE TABLE A VOICE THAT

05:18:07.935 --> 05:18:09.770
HAS BEEN SILENT. AND WE'RE

05:18:09.837 --> 05:18:11.338
GRATEFUL THAT THE LEGISLATURE

05:18:11.405 --> 05:18:12.706
CONTINUES TO FIND COMMUNITY

05:18:12.773 --> 05:18:14.608
BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO WORK

05:18:14.675 --> 05:18:16.477
WITH AND TRAIN FAMILIES BY

05:18:16.544 --> 05:18:18.312
MEETING THEM WHERE THEY'RE APT.

05:18:18.379 --> 05:18:20.448
AND HELPING THEM INTEGRATE INTO

05:18:20.514 --> 05:18:21.348
A SYSTEM ON THE PEER TO PEER

05:18:21.415 --> 05:18:24.552
BASIS. SO WHY HAVE WE NOT SEEN

05:18:24.618 --> 05:18:26.787
THE BETTER RESULTS. OUR CONCERN

05:18:26.854 --> 05:18:28.055
IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO

05:18:28.122 --> 05:18:30.391
INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS OF THE

05:18:30.458 --> 05:18:32.026
FUNDED PROGRAMS TO SEE IF THEY

05:18:32.092 --> 05:18:34.128
HAD ANY AFFECT. WE NEED TO STOP

05:18:34.195 --> 05:18:35.596
ALLOCATING FUNDS FOR PROGRAMS

05:18:35.663 --> 05:18:37.431
THAT REALLY DON'T WORK. AND

05:18:37.498 --> 05:18:38.632
REPLICATE THOSE THAT ACTUALLY

05:18:38.699 --> 05:18:41.168
DO. THE PRIORITY NOW NEEDS TO

05:18:41.235 --> 05:18:43.471
BE ON THE ROAD CASA DISPARITIES

05:18:43.537 --> 05:18:44.505
WE ARE SEEING THAT THE

05:18:44.572 --> 05:18:46.040
ROADBLOCKS MOSTLY HAPPEN WHEN

05:18:46.106 --> 05:18:47.241
THESE GROUPS GRASSROOTS

05:18:47.308 --> 05:18:49.043
EFFORTS. ENGAGE WITH THE

05:18:49.109 --> 05:18:50.845
REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. WHEN A

05:18:50.911 --> 05:18:52.179
COMMUNITY GROUP IS A SYSTEM A

05:18:52.246 --> 05:18:53.647
FAMILY TO GET THE PROPER

05:18:53.714 --> 05:18:55.483
SERVICE AS THEY OFTEN

05:18:55.549 --> 05:18:58.886
EXPERIENCE RESISTANCE. AT THE

05:18:58.953 --> 05:18:59.453
POINT OF ENGAGEMENT WITH THE

05:18:59.520 --> 05:19:00.821
REGIONAL CENTER. MANY OF MY

05:19:00.888 --> 05:19:02.223
COMMUNITY CONTINUE REPORT

05:19:02.289 --> 05:19:03.624
FEELING INTIMIDATED BY THE

05:19:03.691 --> 05:19:05.726
SYSTEM AND ARE SOMETIMES AFRAID

05:19:05.793 --> 05:19:07.495
TO SPEAK UP IN FEAR OF

05:19:07.561 --> 05:19:08.162
RETALIATION AGAINST THEIR

05:19:08.229 --> 05:19:09.997
CHILD. YOU MAY HEAR SOME OF

05:19:10.064 --> 05:19:12.066
THOSE EXAMPLES AND ACTUALLY

05:19:12.132 --> 05:19:12.700
HAVE DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENTS

05:19:12.766 --> 05:19:14.735
TODAY. WE NEED TO SEE THE

05:19:14.802 --> 05:19:16.637
CULTURAL CHANGE AT THE REGIONAL

05:19:16.704 --> 05:19:18.572
CENTER LEVEL. WE NEED TO STOP

05:19:18.639 --> 05:19:20.174
DENYING THAT THE REAL BY OF

05:19:20.241 --> 05:19:22.276
SUCCESS. WE NEED TO STOP

05:19:22.343 --> 05:19:24.345
ATTRIBUTING DISPARITIES TO THE

05:19:24.411 --> 05:19:26.714
ETHNIC CULTURE A FAMILIES THE

05:19:26.780 --> 05:19:28.916
LACK OF EDUCATION OR THE

05:19:28.983 --> 05:19:32.253

SUPPORT. THE REGIONAL CENTERS

05:19:41.929 --> 05:19:43.364
NEED TO MEET FAMILIES RIGHT

05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:45.466
WHERE THEY'RE ACT. THE WAY TO

05:19:45.533 --> 05:19:47.368
CHANGE A CULTURE OF NO IS BY

05:19:47.434 --> 05:19:48.569
ENGAGING THE COMMUNITIES

05:19:48.636 --> 05:19:51.238
IMPACTED BY DISPARITIES TO

05:19:51.305 --> 05:19:51.872
ACTUALLY BE PART OF THE

05:19:51.939 --> 05:19:54.041
SOLUTION. WE WILL GAS AT THE

05:19:54.108 --> 05:19:55.376
PROJECTS THAT ARE PRODUCING THE

05:19:55.442 --> 05:19:58.145
BEST RESULTS ARE THOSE LED BY

DISPARITY. SO WE ALSO REQUEST

CENTER STAFF AND ADVOCATES WHO

05:20:19.667 --> 05:20:21.368
CAN FIND COMMON GROUND AND

05:20:21.435 --> 05:20:21.969

05:20:22.036 --> 05:20:23.671
DIALOGUE. TOWARDS LONG TERM

05:20:23.737 --> 05:20:26.206
SOLUTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH

FOR YOUR TIME AND SUPPORT THANK

05:20:27.808 --> 05:20:32.513
YOU SIR HELLO. CINEMATIC LA- WE

05:20:32.580 --> 05:20:34.181
JUST HAD A COUPLE COMMENTS ON

05:20:34.248 --> 05:20:38.619
AND THIS- ISSUE ONE- IS TO SAY

05:20:38.686 --> 05:20:40.354
THAT GOING BACK TO OUR-

05:20:40.421 --> 05:20:41.755
CONVERSATION MUCH EARLIER IN

05:20:41.822 --> 05:20:44.158
THE DAY ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE

05:20:44.224 --> 05:20:46.827
INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT THIS.

05:20:46.894 --> 05:20:47.895
THE LEGISLATURE DIDN'T CHOOSE

05:20:47.962 --> 05:20:49.597
TO GO FOR THE PERFORMANCE

05:20:49.663 --> 05:20:50.965
INCENTIVE PROGRAM THIS WOULD BE

05:20:51.031 --> 05:20:52.399
ANOTHER SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT

05:20:52.466 --> 05:20:53.367
COULD POTENTIALLY BE SHOULD

05:20:53.434 --> 05:20:55.836
RESTRUCTURED TO TEST INCENTIVES

05:20:55.903 --> 05:20:57.972
TO USE TO ACTUALLY REWARD

05:20:58.038 --> 05:21:00.140
REGIONAL CENTERS FOR CLOSING

05:21:00.207 --> 05:21:02.242
SOME OF THOSE DISPARITY GAPS-

05:21:02.309 --> 05:21:05.913
SAID JUST AN IDEA- AND THEN-

05:21:05.980 --> 05:21:07.448
OUR OTHER COMMENT WOULD REFLECT

05:21:07.514 --> 05:21:08.716
SOMETHING THAT MISTER GOMEZ

05:21:08.782 --> 05:21:10.384
SAID WHICH IS JUST THE NEED FOR

05:21:10.451 --> 05:21:11.719
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH

05:21:11.785 --> 05:21:13.420
PER PROJECTS ARE ACTUALLY

05:21:13.487 --> 05:21:15.456
SUCCESSFUL. AND THROUGH AN

05:21:15.522 --> 05:21:18.258
INDEPENDENT- EVALUATION AS WELL

05:21:18.325 --> 05:21:20.728
AS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF

05:21:20.794 --> 05:21:23.697
THE ROOT CAUSES OF DISPARITY.

05:21:23.764 --> 05:21:34.108
PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TWELVE.

05:21:34.174 --> 05:21:37.277
ALISON RANSOM I AM A MEMBER OF

05:21:37.344 --> 05:21:38.512
BOARD MEMBER DAVE YOU BUT I

05:21:38.579 --> 05:21:40.648
WILL SPEAK WITH THE DIRECTOR OF

05:21:40.714 --> 05:21:42.149
THE SAID LIVE ACTUALLY BECAUSE

05:21:42.216 --> 05:21:44.251
I ALLUDED TO THIS EARLIER I

05:21:44.318 --> 05:21:45.786
THINK THAT INDEPENDENT

05:21:45.853 --> 05:21:47.354
EVALUATION REALLY GOES HAND IN

05:21:47.421 --> 05:21:48.355
HAND WITH A PERFORMANCE

05:21:48.422 --> 05:21:50.190
INCENTIVE PLANS BECAUSE THEY'RE

05:21:50.257 --> 05:21:52.326
BOTH ABOUT TAKING AN OUTCOMES

05:21:52.393 --> 05:21:54.294
BASED IN DATA DRIVEN APPROACH

05:21:54.361 --> 05:21:57.197
TO. DEVELOPING AN EVIDENCE BASE

05:21:57.264 --> 05:21:58.432
ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND DOESN'T

05:21:58.499 --> 05:22:00.300
WORK AND THEN USING THAT AS A

05:22:00.367 --> 05:22:01.835
SPRINGBOARD FROM WHICH TO BUILD

05:22:01.902 --> 05:22:05.372
ON SUCCESS AND ALTHOUGH YOU

05:22:05.439 --> 05:22:07.541
KNOW IT WE I THINK WE ALL AGREE

05:22:07.608 --> 05:22:10.210
THAT THE DISPARITIES OF EVERY

05:22:10.277 --> 05:22:12.379
KIND IN THE SYSTEM ARE A

05:22:12.446 --> 05:22:13.580
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM AND

05:22:13.647 --> 05:22:15.082
CONTINUE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT

05:22:15.149 --> 05:22:15.716
PROBLEM THERE EVEN A MORE

05:22:15.783 --> 05:22:17.284
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM NOW THAN

05:22:17.351 --> 05:22:18.585
THEY WERE WHEN WE STARTED TO

05:22:18.652 --> 05:22:19.486
ADDRESS THEM THREE FOUR YEARS

05:22:19.553 --> 05:22:21.855
AGO- BUT I THINK THIS IS REALLY

05:22:21.922 --> 05:22:23.991
A CASE IN POINT FOR WHY WE NEED

05:22:24.058 --> 05:22:25.559
TO SHIFT THE MENTALITY TO

05:22:25.626 --> 05:22:27.027
REALLY AGAIN COLLECTING

05:22:27.094 --> 05:22:29.029
SYSTEMATICALLY DATA THAT CAN BE

05:22:29.096 --> 05:22:29.863
TRACKED TO DATA THAT IS

05:22:29.930 --> 05:22:32.299
RELIABLE. DATA THIS TRANSPARENT

05:22:32.366 --> 05:22:34.034
DATE IS IT IS ACCOUNTABLE TO

05:22:34.101 --> 05:22:36.103
THE COMMUNITY. AND THINKING

05:22:36.170 --> 05:22:37.671
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IN

05:22:37.738 --> 05:22:40.340
THE SYSTEM. ABOUT MEASURING IT

05:22:40.407 --> 05:22:41.208
IN SUCH A WAY THEY CAN FIGURE

05:22:41.275 --> 05:22:42.943
OUT IF IT'S EFFECTIVE AND SO I

05:22:43.010 --> 05:22:44.712
THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATION

05:22:44.778 --> 05:22:46.146
PIECE WAS NOT BAKED INTO THE

05:22:46.213 --> 05:22:47.214
PERFORMANCE AND SENATE BUT

05:22:47.281 --> 05:22:48.782
SORRY WAS CUT BAKED INTO THE

05:22:48.849 --> 05:22:49.650
DISPARITIES GRANTS AT THE

05:22:49.717 --> 05:22:52.653
OUTSET- MY OWN PERSONAL VIEW IS

05:22:52.720 --> 05:22:53.620
THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO

05:22:53.687 --> 05:22:54.755
ACCOMPLISH THAT. AND I'VE

05:22:54.822 --> 05:22:55.756
MENTIONED THIS BEFORE I DON'T

05:22:55.823 --> 05:22:57.091
THINK IT NECESSARILY NEEDS TO

05:22:57.157 --> 05:23:00.360
BE A LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATION-

05:23:00.427 --> 05:23:01.128
I THINK THERE AGAIN THAT WE

05:23:01.195 --> 05:23:04.098
HAVE A WEALTH OF YOU KNOW OF.

05:23:04.164 --> 05:23:04.798
PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF

05:23:04.865 --> 05:23:06.567
CALIFORNIA WAS VERY INTERESTED

05:23:06.633 --> 05:23:08.168
IN THIS ISSUE IT'S VERY IT'S

05:23:08.235 --> 05:23:09.336
VERY LATE OF ALL. AND I THINK

05:23:09.403 --> 05:23:10.704
PEOPLE IN THE UNIVERSITIES

05:23:10.771 --> 05:23:11.905
ACROSS THE STATE WILL BE

05:23:11.972 --> 05:23:12.806
INTERESTED IN STUDYING THIS

05:23:12.873 --> 05:23:14.541
ISSUE IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

05:23:14.608 --> 05:23:16.643
AND IT'S REALLY SAD THING TO ME

05:23:16.710 --> 05:23:18.011
THAT AFTER THE APPROPRIATIONS I

05:23:18.078 --> 05:23:19.346
THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY TO FORTY

05:23:19.413 --> 05:23:21.281
FOUR MILLION- THAT WE DON'T

05:23:21.348 --> 05:23:22.416
ACTUALLY KNOW ANYTHING MORE

05:23:22.483 --> 05:23:24.952
THAN WE DID FOUR YEARS AGO- I

05:23:25.018 --> 05:23:26.420
THINK THAT ELLIE- SUGGESTION

05:23:26.487 --> 05:23:28.489
ABOUT THE IDEA OF KIND OF

05:23:28.555 --> 05:23:29.823
SEEING THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY

05:23:29.890 --> 05:23:30.591
TO CONVERT IT INTO A

05:23:30.657 --> 05:23:31.992
PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN IN

05:23:32.059 --> 05:23:33.227
WHICH YOU INCENTIVIZE REGIONAL

05:23:33.293 --> 05:23:34.361
CENTERS. I UNDERSTAND THE

05:23:34.428 --> 05:23:36.196
IMPULSE BUT I RESPECTFULLY

05:23:36.263 --> 05:23:38.031
DON'T AGREE AND THAT'S BECAUSE

05:23:38.098 --> 05:23:39.700
MY COLLEAGUE FOR UNDERGO MRS

05:23:39.767 --> 05:23:41.902
TESTIMONY. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE

05:23:41.969 --> 05:23:43.570
OF HAVING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

05:23:43.637 --> 05:23:45.239
PIONEERING THESE PROGRAMS COME

05:23:45.305 --> 05:23:45.806
FROM COMMUNITY BASED

05:23:45.873 --> 05:23:48.075
ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ARE FROM

05:23:48.142 --> 05:23:49.243
THE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

05:23:49.309 --> 05:23:51.311
BEING MOST AFFECTED. THAT ARE

05:23:51.378 --> 05:23:52.980
BEING UNDERSERVED IS CRITICALLY

05:23:53.046 --> 05:23:54.915
IMPORTANT- BUT I THINK THAT

05:23:54.982 --> 05:23:56.550
NEEDS TO BE COUPLED AS HE

05:23:56.617 --> 05:23:57.184
EXPRESSED SO WELL IN HIS

05:23:57.251 --> 05:24:00.154
TESTIMONY. WITH A AGAIN WITH

05:24:00.220 --> 05:24:01.955
INDEPENDENT EVALUATION BECAUSE

05:24:02.022 --> 05:24:03.924
WE CAN'T ASSUME THAT EVERY

05:24:03.991 --> 05:24:05.926
PROGRAM YOU KNOW THAT IS THAT

05:24:05.993 --> 05:24:08.095
IS A LEAD. YOU KNOW I'M SURE

05:24:08.162 --> 05:24:09.496
WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS BY

05:24:09.563 --> 05:24:10.597
INDIVIDUALS FROM COMMITTEES

05:24:10.664 --> 05:24:11.231
THAT ARE UNDERSERVED IS

05:24:11.298 --> 05:24:12.933
NECESSARILY SUCCESSFUL ONE OR

05:24:13.000 --> 05:24:14.902
SUCCESSFUL AS IT COULD BE. SO I

05:24:14.968 --> 05:24:16.503
THINK REALLY THAT THIS JUST

05:24:16.570 --> 05:24:17.671
REALLY MAKES THE CASE FOR

05:24:17.738 --> 05:24:18.972
INDEPENDENT EVALUATION BECAUSE

05:24:19.039 --> 05:24:20.974
SHORTLY AFTER THIS EXPENDITURE

05:24:21.041 --> 05:24:22.442
FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WE

05:24:22.509 --> 05:24:23.477
SHOULD HAVE A RICH EVIDENCE

05:24:23.544 --> 05:24:27.314
SPACE. AND I ALSO WANT TO PICK

05:24:27.381 --> 05:24:28.448
UP VERY BRIEFLY ON. ON A

05:24:28.515 --> 05:24:29.917
DIRECTOR PARCHMENTS POINT IT

05:24:29.983 --> 05:24:32.119
YOU WOULDN'T NECESSARILY EXPECT

05:24:32.186 --> 05:24:33.420
TO SEE AN EFFECT ON THE OVERALL

05:24:33.487 --> 05:24:35.689
YOU KNOW POS DISPARITIES. BUT

05:24:35.756 --> 05:24:37.491
THAT'S THE ONLY METRIC WE HAVE

05:24:37.558 --> 05:24:39.226
WITHOUT DEFINING AT THE OUTSET

05:24:39.293 --> 05:24:40.861
WHAT THE SPECIFIC GOAL OF A

05:24:40.928 --> 05:24:43.397
PILOT IS. SOME PILOTS MAY HAVE

05:24:43.463 --> 05:24:44.765
A MUCH MORE DISCRETE GOAL OF

05:24:44.832 --> 05:24:46.200
SERVING PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES

05:24:46.266 --> 05:24:47.167
WE WOULD NECESSARILY EXPECT

05:24:47.234 --> 05:24:48.535
THEM TO INCLUDE TWO AT IF

05:24:48.602 --> 05:24:50.437
AFFECT THE AGGREGATE NUMBERS.

05:24:50.504 --> 05:24:51.538
RIGHT THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE

05:24:51.605 --> 05:24:52.806
RIGHT METRIC I THINK YOU HAVE

05:24:52.873 --> 05:24:54.675
TO DEVELOP THE METRIC. IN

05:24:54.741 --> 05:24:56.143
CONSIDERATION OF WHAT THE

05:24:56.210 --> 05:24:57.945
PARTICULAR PILOT IS TRYING TO

05:24:58.011 --> 05:24:59.847
ACHIEVE AGAIN ANOTHER FACET THE

05:24:59.913 --> 05:25:00.514
ONE CAN ACCOMPLISH WITH

05:25:00.581 --> 05:25:02.182
INDEPENDENT EVALUATION. THAT WE

05:25:02.249 --> 05:25:03.884
DON'T HAVE A BILL TO CAPACITY

05:25:03.951 --> 05:25:05.719
TO ACCOMPLISH SO FAR THANK YOU.

05:25:05.786 --> 05:25:09.756
THANK YOU. DOOR CONTRAIRE US

05:25:09.823 --> 05:25:11.158

GOMEZ SAID. WHEN HE SPOKE ONE

05:25:15.195 --> 05:25:16.196
OF THE THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO

05:25:16.263 --> 05:25:17.664
SAY THAT I AM PART OF A

05:25:17.731 --> 05:25:19.733
GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION CALL

COLLABORATIVE AND OUR

05:25:23.337 --> 05:25:25.205
ASSIGNMENT THANKS TO. THE

05:25:25.272 --> 05:25:26.607
SUPPORT OF A DIRECTOR

PARCHMENT. WAS TO LOOK FOR

05:25:29.209 --> 05:25:30.611
DISPARITIES IN OUR PARTICULAR.

05:25:30.677 --> 05:25:33.113
LATINO COMMUNITY. WHAT WE HAVE

05:25:33.180 --> 05:25:34.448
DONE IS WE HAVE EDUCATED

05:25:34.514 --> 05:25:36.116
FAMILIES ABOUT HOW TO NAVIGATE

05:25:36.183 --> 05:25:37.751
THE SYSTEM AND IT WAS QUITE

05:25:37.818 --> 05:25:41.388
ASTOUNDING TO FIND. THAT MANY

05:25:41.455 --> 05:25:44.858
OF OUR FAMILIES. HAD NO IDEA.

05:25:44.925 --> 05:25:47.561
OF WHAT TO DO. EXCEPT THAT

05:25:47.628 --> 05:25:48.862
THERE WAS A SERVICE COORDINATOR

05:25:48.929 --> 05:25:50.964

ACTION OF HOW WE WOULD ADDRESS

05:26:03.710 --> 05:26:05.913
SOME OF THEIR NEEDS. AT FIRST

05:26:05.979 --> 05:26:07.714
WHEN WE ENTERED OUR PARTICULAR

05:26:07.781 --> 05:26:09.917
OUR PARTICULAR REGIONAL CENTER

SO- WE WERE SAID THAT TO BE

05:26:15.789 --> 05:26:18.625
AGGRESSIVE. ARE WE WERE SAID IT

05:26:18.692 --> 05:26:20.394
WAS SAID THAT OUR FAMILIES HAD

05:26:20.460 --> 05:26:22.429
CHANGED THAT THEY USE THAT THE

05:26:29.603 --> 05:26:31.705
POINT AND NOW THEY WERE. VERY

05:26:31.772 --> 05:26:35.742
NICE. SO THE PROCESS IN THE

05:26:35.809 --> 05:26:37.377
SERVICES IN THE QUESTIONS THAT

05:26:37.444 --> 05:26:40.147

IT IT'S A COMPLEX SYSTEM FOR

05:26:46.520 --> 05:26:49.222
ANYONE AND IF YOU CAN IMAGINE A

SOME OF THESE- FAMILIES. WE ARE

05:27:01.868 --> 05:27:05.205
TAKING UP TO FIVE FAMILIES TO

FAIR HEARINGS ARE ACTUALLY NOT.

05:27:10.577 --> 05:27:11.044
BECAUSE THEY WERE DENIED

05:27:11.111 --> 05:27:14.348
SERVICES WE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE

05:27:14.414 --> 05:27:15.716

TOOK THEM THROUGH THE ACTUAL

05:27:26.126 --> 05:27:27.594
PREPARATION OF GETTING THE

05:27:27.661 --> 05:27:29.229
EXHIBITS IN THE EVIDENCE TO

05:27:29.296 --> 05:27:31.765
GATHER GOING THROUGH INFORMAL

05:27:31.832 --> 05:27:35.102
FIRST MEDIATION NOT REACHING.

05:27:35.168 --> 05:27:36.636
ANY KIND OF A SOLUTION THEN

05:27:36.703 --> 05:27:38.772
GOING TO FAIR HEARING A FEW OF

05:27:38.839 --> 05:27:40.407

OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE AND A

05:27:44.578 --> 05:27:46.313

05:27:54.388 --> 05:27:56.390
REFUSE TO GO TO APPEAL. SO

05:27:56.456 --> 05:27:58.592

THE REGIONAL CENTER LEVEL I

05:28:00.293 --> 05:28:03.196
THINK I THINK THAT- AT THIS

05:28:03.263 --> 05:28:06.199
POINT- THE REGIONAL CENTER HAS

05:28:06.266 --> 05:28:07.234

05:28:09.302 --> 05:28:11.671
FIRST NAME BASIS AND WE'RE

05:28:11.738 --> 05:28:14.341
BRINGING IN FAMILIES THAT HAD

05:28:14.408 --> 05:28:17.044
NEVER. ACTUALLY ASKED FOR

ANYTHING AND NOW THEY'RE BEING

05:28:19.946 --> 05:28:21.915

05:28:34.394 --> 05:28:36.430
REGIONAL CENTER EXISTS BECAUSE

05:28:36.496 --> 05:28:38.832

REGIONAL CENTERS CAN. ADDRESS

05:35:34.614 --> 05:35:35.482
THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN

05:35:35.548 --> 05:35:36.816
RAISED IS BY PARTNERING WITH

05:35:36.883 --> 05:35:38.318

05:36:01.274 --> 05:36:03.376
PROVIDE INFORMATION IN A WAY

05:36:03.443 --> 05:36:06.246
THAT'S DIGESTIBLE FOR PEOPLE-

05:36:06.312 --> 05:36:08.081
THIS IS A SPACE WHERE WE HAVE A

05:36:08.147 --> 05:36:10.917
LOT OF DATA. WE HAVE PAGES AND

05:36:10.984 --> 05:36:12.652
PAGES PROBABLY ABOUT SEVENTY

05:36:12.719 --> 05:36:14.020
PAGES PER REGIONAL CENTER EVERY

05:36:14.087 --> 05:36:16.956
YEAR. AND IT'S GETTING DOWN TO

05:36:17.023 --> 05:36:18.758
WHAT IS THE DATA TELLING US AND

05:36:18.825 --> 05:36:20.960
IN A RECENT- DEVELOPMENTAL

05:36:21.027 --> 05:36:24.964
SERVICES. WORK GROUP ON EQUITY

05:36:25.031 --> 05:36:26.199
THE DEPARTMENT PRESENTED SOME

05:36:26.266 --> 05:36:28.501
REALLY CRITICAL DATA THEY SAID

05:36:28.568 --> 05:36:31.237
THAT- THE SLIDES A PRESENTED

05:36:31.304 --> 05:36:33.339
SHOWED THAT- MISTER GOMEZ'S

05:36:33.406 --> 05:36:35.141
RIGHT THAT IF YOU JUST LOOK AT

05:36:35.208 --> 05:36:37.443
THAT TOP LEVEL FOR THE AVERAGE

05:36:37.510 --> 05:36:41.915
PERSON- FOR THE WHITE VERSES

05:36:41.981 --> 05:36:45.051
THE- ALL OTHERS. THERE IS ABOUT

05:36:45.118 --> 05:36:47.053
A 50% DIFFERENCE BUT WHEN YOU

05:36:47.120 --> 05:36:48.521
START TO DRILL DOWN THE STORY

05:36:48.588 --> 05:36:50.089
GETS A LITTLE MORE NUANCED AND

05:36:50.156 --> 05:36:52.492
A LITTLE MORE COMPLEX. WHEN YOU

05:36:52.559 --> 05:36:54.460
LOOK AT INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE

05:36:54.527 --> 05:36:55.962
LIVING AT HOME WHO WERE AT

05:36:56.029 --> 05:36:57.830
LEAST THREE YEARS OLD. AND IT

05:36:57.897 --> 05:36:59.165
YOU'RE REALLY CONTROLLING FOR

05:36:59.232 --> 05:37:00.433
WHERE THAT PERSON LIVES

05:37:00.500 --> 05:37:01.935
REGARDLESS OF WHY THEY'RE

05:37:02.001 --> 05:37:04.170
LIVING AT HOME YOU GET FROM A

05:37:04.237 --> 05:37:05.972
50% DIFFERENCE TO YOU NARROW IT

05:37:06.039 --> 05:37:08.341
DOWN TO ABOUT A 22% DIFFERENCE

05:37:08.408 --> 05:37:10.677
STILL WORK TO BE DONE STILL

05:37:10.743 --> 05:37:12.545
CRITICAL TO FOCUS ON. BUT IT

05:37:12.612 --> 05:37:13.646
PAINTS A LITTLE BIT OF A

05:37:13.713 --> 05:37:14.948
DIFFERENT PICTURE AND IT HELPS

05:37:15.014 --> 05:37:16.716
US FOCUS OUR ENERGY IS A LITTLE

05:37:16.783 --> 05:37:18.918
MORE. AND THEN WHEN YOU LOK AT

05:37:18.985 --> 05:37:21.521
JUST CHILDREN THREE TO TWENTY

05:37:21.588 --> 05:37:22.355
ONE LIVING AT HOME SO YOU CARVE

05:37:22.422 --> 05:37:23.923
OUT THE ADULT POPULATION SO NOW

05:37:23.990 --> 05:37:25.892
YOU'RE CONTROLLING FOR AGE AS

05:37:25.959 --> 05:37:28.728
WELL AS PLACE OF RESIDENCE. YOU

05:37:28.795 --> 05:37:31.431
GET DOWN 284% IS THE AMOUNT

05:37:31.497 --> 05:37:34.601
THAT SPENT ON PER CAPITA FOR

05:37:34.667 --> 05:37:36.636
NON WHITES COMPARED TO WHITES.

05:37:36.703 --> 05:37:38.671
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE

05:37:38.738 --> 05:37:40.640
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. BUT

05:37:40.707 --> 05:37:42.442
IT'S ALSO CRITICAL THAT WE LOOK

05:37:42.508 --> 05:37:44.010
AT THIS DATA IN ADDITIONAL

05:37:44.077 --> 05:37:45.979
DETAIL AND THAT WE THINK ABOUT

05:37:46.045 --> 05:37:48.848
SERVICES THAT. AND PLACES OF

05:37:48.915 --> 05:37:50.917
STRENGTH IN OUR SYSTEM FOR

05:37:50.984 --> 05:37:52.919
INSTANCE AN EARLY START PROGRAM

05:37:52.986 --> 05:37:54.787
THERE ARE POPULATIONS THAT ARE

05:37:54.854 --> 05:37:56.689
ACTUALLY RECEIVING MORE

05:37:56.756 --> 05:37:58.858
SERVICES PER CAPITA. PAID BY

05:37:58.925 --> 05:38:00.760
THE REGIONAL CENTER THAN WHITES

05:38:00.827 --> 05:38:02.862
SO WHAT'S WORKING THERE WHAT IS

05:38:02.929 --> 05:38:04.964
EFFECTIVE THEIR INNER RESPITE

05:38:05.031 --> 05:38:07.867
SERVICES FOR- CHILDREN LIVING

05:38:07.934 --> 05:38:10.403
AT HOME. THE AVERAGE HISPANIC

05:38:10.470 --> 05:38:11.638
CHILD IS RECEIVING MORE THAN

05:38:11.704 --> 05:38:13.106
THE AVERAGE WHITE TRIALS SO

05:38:13.172 --> 05:38:14.874
AGAIN A PLACE OF STRENGTH IN

05:38:14.941 --> 05:38:18.478
THE SYSTEM. IN SHORT IT'S JUST

05:38:18.544 --> 05:38:20.613
REALLY COMPLICATED AND THE

05:38:20.680 --> 05:38:22.682
REGIONAL CENTERS APPRECIATE THE

05:38:22.749 --> 05:38:24.917
EFFORTS OF EVERYONE AND THE

05:38:24.984 --> 05:38:26.753
ABILITY TO REALLY FOCUS SOME

05:38:26.819 --> 05:38:29.088
COMMITTED ENERGY TO ADDRESSING

05:38:29.155 --> 05:38:31.591
THE ISSUES TO MAKING SURE THAT

SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE IN AN

05:38:33.893 --> 05:38:36.362
EQUITABLE WAY TO PEOPLE. AND TO

05:38:36.429 --> 05:38:38.131
FINDING WAYS TO DRILL INTO THE

05:38:38.197 --> 05:38:40.466
DATA AND ALSO TO RECOGNIZE AS

05:38:40.533 --> 05:38:42.502
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SO MUCH THIS

05:38:42.568 --> 05:38:44.871
EVENING ALREADY. THOSE THINGS

05:38:44.937 --> 05:38:47.940
THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY TIED TO

05:38:48.007 --> 05:38:49.409
PURCHASE OF SERVICE BECAUSE

05:38:49.475 --> 05:38:50.443
REGIONAL CENTERS DO SO MUCH

05:38:50.510 --> 05:38:52.111
MORE SO WE HAVE DATA AT OUR

05:38:52.178 --> 05:38:54.180
DISPOSAL THAT WE NEED TO USE IN

05:38:54.247 --> 05:38:56.049
NEW AND DIFFERENT WAYS. LOOKING

05:38:56.115 --> 05:38:57.183
AT SATISFACTION WITH THE

05:38:57.250 --> 05:39:00.486
SERVICE SYSTEM LOOKING AT-

05:39:00.553 --> 05:39:02.088
SERVICE COORDINATION THE

05:39:02.155 --> 05:39:03.056
QUALITY OF THE RELATIONSHIPS

05:39:03.122 --> 05:39:06.192
AND- INVESTING TIME AND ENERGY

05:39:06.259 --> 05:39:08.027
INTO EVALUATING THAT DATA

05:39:08.094 --> 05:39:09.562
ACROSS THE SAME RACIAL AND

05:39:09.629 --> 05:39:11.564
ETHNIC LINES BECAUSE ULTIMATELY

05:39:11.631 --> 05:39:13.132
THIS NEEDS TO BE A SYSTEM THAT

05:39:13.199 --> 05:39:15.301
EVOLVES AND THAT WORKS WELL FOR

05:39:15.368 --> 05:39:17.737
EVERYONE BUT IT SERVES THANK

05:39:17.804 --> 05:39:19.672
YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. SEEING NO

05:39:19.739 --> 05:39:22.141
FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE

05:39:22.208 --> 05:39:22.742
TWELVE I WILL BRING IT UP TO

05:39:22.809 --> 05:39:25.578
THE SUBCOMMITTEE- IF I COULD I

05:39:25.645 --> 05:39:27.647
WANTED A QUOTE. DISABILITY

05:39:27.714 --> 05:39:29.749
VOICES UNITED ON PAGE FORTY

05:39:29.816 --> 05:39:32.885
NINE. YOU SAID THAT THERE'S

05:39:32.952 --> 05:39:33.653
BEEN NO WAS SAYS OF THE GRANTS

05:39:33.720 --> 05:39:35.288
OF TARGETED REGIONAL CENTERS

05:39:35.354 --> 05:39:36.622
WITH THE GREATEST LEVEL OF

05:39:36.689 --> 05:39:38.224
DISPARITIES AND THAT THE

05:39:38.291 --> 05:39:39.659
DEPARTMENT HAS NOT TIED THE

05:39:39.726 --> 05:39:41.627
RECEIPTS OF FUNDS. TO A

05:39:41.694 --> 05:39:42.762
DEMONSTRATION OF PROGRAM

05:39:42.829 --> 05:39:45.264
EFFECTIVENESS. I THOUGHT THAT

05:39:45.331 --> 05:39:47.100
WAS A VERY POWERFUL STATEMENT

05:39:47.166 --> 05:39:50.069
AND SOMETHING THAT- I THINK I

05:39:50.136 --> 05:39:53.005
WANTED TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT A

05:39:53.072 --> 05:39:55.808
LITTLE BIT ABOUT IF WERE. WHO

05:39:55.875 --> 05:39:57.810
WHO WHICH PACIFIC TARGETS FOR

05:39:57.877 --> 05:40:00.213
WHAT METRIC ARE WE TRYING TO

05:40:00.279 --> 05:40:05.151
FIX. IN REDUCING DISPARITIES.

05:40:05.218 --> 05:40:07.720
WHEN WE HAVE SO THE MEASURES

05:40:07.787 --> 05:40:09.188
THAT I WAS REFERRING TO SO WE

05:40:09.255 --> 05:40:10.123
THAT'S THE METRICS THAT WE'VE

05:40:10.189 --> 05:40:13.559
BEEN- I HAD IDENTIFIED SO WHEN

05:40:13.626 --> 05:40:15.161
WE FIRST STARTED THE

05:40:15.228 --> 05:40:18.197
MEASUREMENTS- AGAIN BACK AND

05:40:18.264 --> 05:40:18.765
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND THEN THE

05:40:18.831 --> 05:40:19.632
FIRST YEAR THAT WE HAD THE

05:40:19.699 --> 05:40:23.436
DISPARITY FUNDS- WAS IN TWENTY

05:40:23.503 --> 05:40:24.804
SIXTEEN AND SO USING THAT AND

05:40:24.871 --> 05:40:27.640
THEN WE JUST CLOSED OUT OUR OUR

05:40:27.707 --> 05:40:29.575
FISCAL YEAR OF EIGHTEEN

05:40:29.642 --> 05:40:31.110
NINETEEN WITH. SO WE COULD CAN

05:40:31.177 --> 05:40:33.613
A POPULATE THAT AND AS I SAID I

05:40:33.679 --> 05:40:34.580
KIND OF GAVE YOU EVERYBODY A

05:40:34.647 --> 05:40:36.282
SNEAK PEEK OF BECAUSE WE'RE

05:40:36.349 --> 05:40:37.550
STILL WORKING THROUGH SOME OF

05:40:37.617 --> 05:40:39.118
THE DATA AND THAT THAT'S WHAT

05:40:39.185 --> 05:40:39.886
WE'RE DOING AS FAR AS THE

05:40:39.952 --> 05:40:41.621
METRICS IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY

05:40:41.687 --> 05:40:44.524
IMPORTANT THAT WE- ALSO TAKE A

05:40:44.590 --> 05:40:46.058
LOOK AT THE MEASURES THAT WE

05:40:46.125 --> 05:40:48.795
HAD IDENTIFIED BACK IN TWO

05:40:48.861 --> 05:40:50.530
THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN- THE

05:40:50.596 --> 05:40:52.265
DISPARITY DATA WORK GROUP AS

05:40:52.331 --> 05:40:54.700
WELL AS THE SERVICE- EQUITY

05:40:54.767 --> 05:40:55.902
WORKGROUP BUT THE DS TASK

05:40:55.968 --> 05:40:58.271
FORCE. IN IN TAKING A LOOK AT

05:40:58.337 --> 05:41:00.506
WHAT ARE THE METRICS GOING

05:41:00.573 --> 05:41:02.909
FORWARD YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT

05:41:02.975 --> 05:41:04.477
WE ARE USING IS THAT WHAT WE

05:41:04.544 --> 05:41:05.878
SHOULD BE USING OR SHOULD WE

05:41:05.945 --> 05:41:08.414
START IDENTIFYING OTHER WAYS TO

05:41:08.481 --> 05:41:11.217
BE ABLE TO- PRIORITIZE THOSE

05:41:11.284 --> 05:41:13.219
THOSE MEASURES ON THIS IS THE

05:41:13.286 --> 05:41:14.320
TIME THAT THAT WE NEED TO DO

05:41:14.387 --> 05:41:16.589
THAT- THERE WAS AN INITIATIVE

05:41:16.656 --> 05:41:19.292
THAT HAD HAPPENED THAT WE- HAD

05:41:19.358 --> 05:41:20.860
LIFTED THE CAP I CAN'T REMEMBER

05:41:20.927 --> 05:41:22.595
WHAT WHAT YEAR IT WAS IT WAS

05:41:22.662 --> 05:41:23.763
LAST BUDGET YEAR THE ARTS

05:41:23.830 --> 05:41:26.899
COUPLE BUDGET YEARS. AGO AND

05:41:26.966 --> 05:41:28.401
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID

05:41:28.467 --> 05:41:29.869
IS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

05:41:29.936 --> 05:41:32.538
THAT WE WERE MEASURING BECAUSE-ONE AT THAT WAS ONE OF THE

05:41:32.605 --> 05:41:34.407
STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE

05:41:34.473 --> 05:41:36.442
INEQUITY OF SPENDING TO HAVE

05:41:36.509 --> 05:41:39.712
THAT IS A RESOURCE AND THE AS-

05:41:39.779 --> 05:41:41.447
MISS WESLEY HAD HAD NOTED IS

05:41:41.514 --> 05:41:44.150
THAT WE DON'T HAVE WHEN WE TAKE

05:41:44.217 --> 05:41:46.452
A LOOK AT JUST ON PER CAPITA

05:41:46.519 --> 05:41:50.223
THE COST OF BREAST BUT- IS.

05:41:50.289 --> 05:41:52.358
BETWEEN WHITES AND NON WHITES-

05:41:52.425 --> 05:41:53.993
WE DO SEE THAT AS A PER CAPITA

05:41:54.060 --> 05:41:56.395
EQUAL COST- SO WHEN WE LIFTED

05:41:56.462 --> 05:41:57.797
THE CAP WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

05:41:57.864 --> 05:41:59.765
THAT IT WASN'T GOING TO ALL THE

05:41:59.832 --> 05:42:02.168
SAID NOW CREATE A AN INEQUITY A

05:42:02.235 --> 05:42:04.904
SPENDING- I SAY AND PEOPLE I'VE

05:42:04.971 --> 05:42:06.405
HEARD. ME SAID AND IN DIFFERENT

05:42:06.472 --> 05:42:07.840
MEETINGS THAT WE'VE HAD YEAH WE

05:42:07.907 --> 05:42:09.809
HAVE THAT DATA BUT WE STILL

05:42:09.876 --> 05:42:10.977
HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE

05:42:11.043 --> 05:42:12.144
QUALITATIVE PIECE OF IT AS

05:42:12.211 --> 05:42:14.413
WELL. SO THAT IS THAT'S THE

05:42:14.480 --> 05:42:15.948
QUANTITATIVE WE KNOW THAT'S THE

05:42:16.015 --> 05:42:18.184
DOLLAR TO DOLLAR. BUT THEN-

05:42:18.251 --> 05:42:19.418
WHAT IS IT THAT THE FAMILIES

05:42:19.485 --> 05:42:20.820
ARE SAYING WAS THE EXPERIENCE

05:42:20.887 --> 05:42:22.054
OF THE RESPITE SERVICES THAT

05:42:22.121 --> 05:42:23.623

05:42:26.325 --> 05:42:28.227
APPROPRIATE IS SAID YEAH THOSE

05:42:28.294 --> 05:42:29.595
ARE THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY

05:42:29.662 --> 05:42:30.596
