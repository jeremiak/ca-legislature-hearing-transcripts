ANY EMAILS SO THAT WE RECEIVED BY THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS TODAY WILL BE COMPILED AND SENT TO ALL MEMBERS SO I AM TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE- SO THEY'LL BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL THE STREET VIEW. AS I SAID BEFORE TODAY'S HEARING WILL RESERVE MOST OF THE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. I WILL ALLOW ALL MATT WELL AT LEAST HALF OF THE TIME I WILL ALLOW ALL MEMBERS TO MAKE OPENING COMMENTS- THEN WE'LL TURN TO OUR PANELISTS. WE HAVE ONLY ONE I'LL TODAY WHICH WILL DISCUSS OF COURSE THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE AT THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS. WE HAVE ASKED THE LATE NIGHT OF ANALYST'S OFFICE TO WALK US THROUGH ALL OF THE PROPOSALS AND THEN THE ADMINISTRATION WILL PROVIDE SOME BRICK. SPONSORED THAT PAT HAS CAN. WE'LL HAVE QUESTIONS AND DIALOGUE WITH THE PANELISTS FINALLY- ONCE THE MEMBER QUESTIONS HAVE CONCLUDED I WILL OPEN UP THE HEARING- FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. FIRST TAKING PUBLIC COMMENT FROM THOSE IN THE ROOM AND THEN OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT FROM THOSE WHO ARE CALLING IN. AND WE HAVE ONLY FOUR PEOPLE HERE SO WE'RE NOT READY TO TAKE A ROLL CALL YET- WILL WAIT TO DO THAT. BUT I DO HAVE SOME OPENING COMMENTS AND TO- THEN IF- ANY OF YOU HAVE OPENING COMMENTS WILL TAKE THOSE AND THEN WILL PROCEED TO THE PANEL. SO TODAY WE WILL HEAR IN MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S REVISED BUDGET WHICH INCLUDES DIFFICULT CUTS AT LOWER LEVELS OF FUNDING TO PROGRAMS THAT THIS SUBCOMMITTEE CARES DEEPLY ABOUT. AS OF THE CORONAVIRUS SHUT DOWN AROUND THE WORLD WITH- IT'S INTERESTING THAT WE'VE SEEN LEVELS OF POLLUTION AND CO TM CO TWO EMISSIONS DROP EVERYWHERE AND THE RESULTING. TAX ARE OBVIOUS BLUE SKIES AND CLEANER AIR. GOALS THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH OUR CLIMATE RELATED ACTIONS WELL THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF SHUTTING THE WORLD DOWN- TERRIBLE BEFORE US THANK LIES AN OPPORTUNE EIGHTY TO FIND THE DEMAND FOR JOBS AND GROWTH. OF WHICH SURE IT UP ALONG WITH. COVERAGE. TODAY'S HEARING IS FINAL FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT HEARING FROM THE PUBLIC SINCE THIS MAY BE OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THESE ISSUES THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT AN IDEAL SITUATION AND SO I WOULD WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU ALL. A CONTINUE TO EXPRESS YOURSELVES OUTSIDE OF THE HEARING PROCESS BY SENDING EMAILS AND CONTACTING US AND- OTHER WAYS- THE THAT YOU MAY HAVE TO VOICE YOUR CONCERNS AND YOUR OPINIONS. NOW I'VE HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED FOR RESOURCES IN THE MAY REVISION AND I'M SURE OTHERS TO TWO. OF I UNDERSTAND TOUGH SIX RP DID I THINK WE ALL. AND WE ALL HAVE TO DO. PLUS BUT THERE ARE MANY INCONSISTENCIES THAT I FIND CONCERNING FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE PROPOSED ONGOING BASELINE REDUCTIONS ALONG PROGRAM ALONGSIDE PROGRAM EXPANSIONS. I'M ALSO CONCERNED WITH THE ROLLBACK OF THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND WHICH AIR MARKS THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR A VARIETY OF CONSERVATION EFFORTS. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WOULD SHIFT EIGHTEEN POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ONGOING BASIS FROM THE WILD CONSERVE IT WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND WHILE I- CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT- DFW NEEDS ADDITIONAL FUNDING TAKING FROM ANOTHER SISTER AGENCY CONDUCTING COMPLIMENTARY WORK IS IN MY OPINION NOT THE RIGHT APPROACH AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF THE EXT OF THE HABITAT CONSERVATION. WHAT'S THE NEGOTIATED BUDGET DEAL FROM ONLY A YEAR AGO. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BASICALLY UNDO THAT DEAL AND THE AT IT JUST SEEMS SO ODD TO ME THAT IT THIS IS NOT THE WAY WE SHOULD BE OPERATING- BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE IF WE CUT A DEAL. AT A MINIMUM IF THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A CHANGE TO A DEAL THAT WAS JUST CUT LAST YEAR. I WOULD THINK THAT THE BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE TO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE- THROUGH THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. AND DISCUSS THAT AND SEE IF THERE ISN'T. A BETTER WAY- OTHERWISE WHY ARE WE MAKING DEALS. SO I AM ALSO VERY FRUSTRATED WITH- MANY TRANSFERS- TO OFFSET THE USE OF THE GENERAL FUND. MOST NOTABLY- THERE'S A TRANSFER OF NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUND. I'M CONCERNED THAT THESE FUNCHESS WILL HAVE AN OVERALL REGRESSIVE IMPACT ON ALL OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES AND EFFORTS. HOWEVER TO ENSURE ADEQUATE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT- I'M NOT CONNECT- ASK THE QUESTIONS AT ALL WITH HOLD ANY OTHER COMMENTS AND DISCUSS- WITH THE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENTS OFFLINE. ON THE WHOLE I THINK GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE- THE- DEPARTMENTS HAVE PRESENTED US WITH- THERE- BEST CASE SCENARIO- AND HAVE DONE A REASONABLY GOOD JOB IN DOING SO- GIVEN A VERY VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THE- REALLY CALAMITOUS DROP IN REVENUES WE ARE- DEEP. WITHIN THE STATE. I'M HOPE THAT TODAY'S SPEAKERS WILL BE CONSCIOUS OF OUR GOAL TO MAXIMIZE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND KEEP INTRODUCTORY REMARKS AND QUESTIONS TO A- THAT TO A MINIMUM BUT TO A REASONABLE- LENGTH SO THAT- WE ARE ABLE TO TIME WE GET TO PUBLIC COMMENT. AGAIN WE WILL BEGIN PUBLIC COMMENT NO LATER THAN ELEVEN THIRTY AM AS WE HAVE A HARD STOP FOR THIS HEARING AT ONE PM AND LET ME REEMPHASIZE. THAT DATA POINT OF WE WILL NOT HAVE THIS FROM AS OF PM AND SO WE HAVE TO FINISH OUR BUSINESS- UNFORTUNATELY. IN THE OF THREE HOURS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO US- WITH THAT SAID TO. DALY OF MY LOOK LIKE TO MAKE OPENING REMARKS. AND YET WE DO HAVE- ENOUGH PEOPLE HERE TO TAKE ALSO THANK YOU WELL TAKE ROLE AND BECOME A FORMAL. FORMALIZE BODY. BLOOM HERE FONG HERE GARCIA MULLIN. PATTERSON RAY YES RIVAS. AT THE- MS GARCIA HAS SAID. EXTENSIVE DESIRE TO MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT AT THANK YOU AND I WILL BE BRIEF AND ALSO- REALLY MY QUESTION THAT AFFECT OTHER CHANNELS FOR THAT PUBLIC CAN PARTICIPATE BUT I DID WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS MYSELF AND THE PROPOSAL I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE. TOUGH CHOICES TO MAKE AND I JUST HOPE AS WE'RE MAKING THESE. THINK ABOUT A MORE THAN EQUAL SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT 10% ACROSS THE BOARD BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT EQUITY. ALONG THAT WAY AND WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN TO SOME OF OUR MORE AFFORDABLE COMMUNITIES- AND SO WITH THAT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT THIRTY PIECES AND- THAT MAY REALIZE THAT I. WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE- IS- POLLUTION CONTROL FINE AND THE MONEY THAT'S BEING PULLED OUT THERE- IT IS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THINK ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS SO WHAT THAT MEANS OUR CLEAN AIR. OF WORK THAT WE STILL NEED TO DO IN A LOT OF THESE COMMUNITIES WELL WE POPULOUS GUY THINK COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE I. HAVEN'T SEEN IN. MANY MANY YEARS WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A TEMPORARY THING AND WHATNOT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE COMMUNITIES WHERE. ARE OUR QUALITY HOT HAS BEEN. SOME OF THE WORST MISTAKE OUT FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND SO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MAKING. WHAT WE'RE THINKING THAT THROUGH. ANA ALONG THE WAY THE MONIES ARE IN YOU JUST HAVE. TO FIND. SOME STRUCTURAL DEFICITS WITH THE DEPARTMENT AT T. AND T. WHICH- THIS LAPTOP THE CLEAN UP OUR- REMOTE. THE ASIAN OVER THAT ALL. IT DISTRICTS AWHILE. THE NURSE. ALLOWED TO LET OUR- I. FIVE AND A CONTAMINANTS IN MY WATER AND- HAVING A- CONTINUE TO PLACE AN- THERE. I'M INCLUDE EXCITED AS WE AT HOW USE THOSE. FOR THE HOME. AT OUR- MEETING. AND WERE BORN MONEY SITE WE- THAT. EXCESSIVE BACK. ON ALTHOUGH THE TO FIGHT CHAPTER ELEVEN. OUR EARLIER THIS WEEK AND SO NOT SURE IF THAT HAPPENS WHAT DOES AS WE'RE DOING THIS MOVEMENT IN THIS. LOCAL TIME AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE THINKING LONG TERM. AS WE'RE DEALING WITH THE SHORT TERM PROBLEM- ALONG THE WAY AND THEN FINALLY ABOUT AB SIX SEVENTEEN. HAS BEEN A PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A COUPLE YEARS THAT IDENTIFIES HOT SPOTS AROUND THE STATE. AND WORK HAS BEEN A- GROUPS UP MORE ADDING THREE ADDITIONAL COMMUNITIES THIS YEAR. BUT WE ARE CUTTING THAT KIND OF BIT. ALONG THE WAY AND SO AS WE LOOK AT HOW THAT AFFECTS. COMMUNITIES OF COLOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH LUCIA. LIKE IT ARE TEMPLE. IN DEAL SELECTING BUT IT EXCEPT MARK. IS EVEN MORE AND- AS A STRUGGLING FROM TO SEE A- THE- ONE WAY ADDING THE- CAN. THERE AND SO. THE THAT. I'M TO. FORM FOR. FIFTEEN FIVE EXTRA WAY. THANK YOU CHAIR BLOOM AND THE SPEAKER STAFF- FOR SETTING UP THIS HEARING. OF YOU KNOW. OF I AM VERY CONCERNED OF HOW. ARE BUDGET AND THE CUTS THAT WE ARE PROPOSING WILL AFFECT DISADVANTAGED. COMMUNITIES IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THAT RIGHT NOW ARE ALSO THE MOST AFFECTED. BY THE COVERT CRISIS AND- CONSIDERING THAT- OUR STATE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE AN EXCESSIVELY HOT SUMMER- I HAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT INCREASE STATS BECAUSE PEOPLE- FINANCIALLY CAN'T AFFORD. TO TURN ON THEIR AIR CONDITIONERS- AND- THEY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY THEY ARE BEING AFFECTED BY THE PRICE. AND I THINK. STAY HOME SO I THINK SOME. WE COULD BE MAKING FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE. TO CONNECT THEM TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE ALREADY HAS- AND SO. I JUST WANNA I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS HEARING AND- AND TO SEE WHAT WE CAN ALL DO TOGETHER- FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON. THANK YOU MISTER THANK FOR A- THAT TO ME JUST TO HELP MAKE ONE QUICK COMMENT- I AM PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE D. T. T. A STRUCTURE SHORTFALL- THERE'S SOME I THINK RATHER- LARGE EXPENSIVE- FEE INCREASES COMING- WE ARE SEEING A LARGE NUMBER PERMITTED FACILITIES. DECLINING PASSED THE GOING OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS BECAUSE OF INCREASED REGULATORY AND COST BURDENS. AND I'M NOT REALLY CONVINCED THAT THIS IS GONNA CHANGE OR REVERSE THAT COPIED. HAVING SAID THAT I HOPING SOMEWHERE IN THE PRESENTATION AND. THE TWENTY TWO A- THIS CALL WITH PROPOSED A JETS MISSED IN THE SNOW FEES WE ARE SO. WHAT KIND OF PERFORMANCE BASED METRICS ARE GOING TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS AND OTHER WORDS WERE ASKING LOTS OF AND HE'S REGULATORY COSTS. HOW DOES THE DEPARTMENT HOLD ITSELF ACCOUNTABLE AND BE TRANSPARENT WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE PROCESS WILL BE MUCH IMPROVED SO THAT WE ACTUALLY SEE. PERMITS IT'S TIME APPROVE FOR THE PURPOSES OF HANDLING THESE HAZARDOUS- MATERIALS I HOPE THAT THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED SOMETIME IN THE PRESENTATION IF NOT I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW. SURE NO PROBLEM. ALL RIGHT WELL WE WILL BEGIN WITH OUR TOP PANEL DISCUSSION NOW WE HAVE- AS INTENTIONALLY ONE PANEL AND WE WILL BEGIN- BY HEARING FROM BRIAN BROWN DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES ALL RIGHT GOOD MORNING. AND WE CAN SEE CHAIRED MEMBERS BRIAN BROWN WITH THE LA- I A- DO YOU HAVE THE INTENTIONHAND OUT WHICH I HAVE PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS AND HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE A COPY- I WILL ALSO UPDATE THEIR HAND OUT IS AVAILABLE ON THE LA- WEBSITE. AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE WEBSITE FOR THE PUBLIC- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL TRY TO MOVE THROUGH THIS FAIRLY QUICKLY- HOWEVER IF THE COMMITTEE DOES HAVE QUESTION I AM AVAILABLE AT THE END. OF THE- IF YOU TURN TO OKAY. THIS IS A HIGH LOW OVERVIEW OF THE MAY REVIEW FOR TO REACHED AGE. RELATIVE TO THE JANUARY BUDGET PROVIDES FOR THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT OVERVIEW AND I THINK THAT YOU KEY TAKE AWAYS FOR THE COMMITTEE THE FIRST IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR LOCATION SPENDING IT IS DOWN OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THE MAY REVISION RELATIVE TO JANUARY. THIS IS LARGER THAN BY A REDUCTION IN PROJECTED. IN PROJECTED- TRANSPORTATION REVENUES FROM DIESEL SALES TAX AND- EXCISE GASOLINE TAXES THIS PRIMARILY AFFECTS TO PROGRAMS THAT OUR FORMULA FUNDED FOR LOCAL AGENCIES. THAT IS THE STATE TRANSIT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND THE LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS PROGRAM. THE SECOND MAJOR TAKE AWAY FROM THIS PAGE IS THAT IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE OTHER AGENCIES THE LEVEL OF SPENDING IS NOT DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT ON NET FROM THE JANUARY BUDGET HOWEVER UNDERLYING ALL OF THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ADJUSTMENTS BOTH MOSTLY DOWNWARD BUT ALSO SOME UPWARD AS WELL THAT THAT EACH OTHER OUT INTO THOSE ARE WHAT ALL TALK ABOUT. THE NEXT FEW. IT TURNED AND- EACH ITS TITLE GONNA FUND. EXPENDITURE A- THIS IS A LISTING OF ALL OF THE EXPENDITURE REDUCTION PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISED RELATIVE TO THE JANUARY BUDGET. I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM OF COURSE BUT IF YOU DO LOOK THROUGH THE LIST I THINK WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THAT THE MAIN THEME IS THAT MOST OF THE REDUCTION WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS. ARE NOT ONES THAT ARE CUTS TO BASELINE FUNDING FOR RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS INSTEAD MOST OF THEM ARE- SOME COMBINATION OF WITHDRAWAL- PROPOSAL MADE IN JANUARY. FINE SHIPS- FOR EXAMPLE REFERENCE EARLIER THE USE OF A PC ACT TO BACK FILL A GENERAL FUND SPENDING PROPOSED IN JANUARY. OR THE REVERSION OF PRIOR YEAR EXPENDITURES APPROVED SO VERY PARTICULAR FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS THAT WOULD NOW BE EITHER PAUSED OR- OR STOPPED- ON ON AN ONGOING BASIS. NOT JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF EXCEPTIONS TO THOSE- THAT THAT SORT OF GENERAL THEME. THE FIRST IS WITH RESPECT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IS THE FIFTH ITEM DOWN ON. THE LIST- TRIGGER CUTS TO BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROGRAM I HAD LIKE THIS BECAUSE THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE THERE IS A BASELINE REDUCTION PROPOSED FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE. TOTAL THIRTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL TO OFFSET THAT IN PART BY ABOUT NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND. THE OTHER EXCEPTIONAL POINT OUT IS FOR THE FROM THE BOTTOM ON THE LIST THE RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF FUNNY PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR A NEW STATE PARK- THIS IS A REDUCTION FROM A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL IN JANUARY- IN THIS CASE WE RECOMMEND A REJECTION OF THE PROPOSAL PARTLY DUE TO THE GENERAL FUND CONDITION YEAH. BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE WAS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT PARK WOULD BE OUR WEBSITE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CREATE THIS NEW PARK. IN PERSON- THE IMPLICATION READING PARK IS THAT THERE WOULD BE FUTURE CAPITAL COST FOR IMPROVEMENTS AS WELL I'M GOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS AND IT SEEMS. AT THIS POINT PRUDENT TO THE CHRIS **** PROJECT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SITE IS. IF YOU TURN TO THE THIRD PAGE. THIS IS A OF THE- FINE LOAN ENTRANCE. PROPOSED TO THE GENERAL FUND. AS YOU CAN SEE ONE POINT BILION. IN TOTAL. AND THIS IS THAT MAKE UP THE BIGGEST. SOURCE OF SOLUTIONS FOR THE GENERAL FUND. IN THESE PROGRAM AREAS. IN GENERAL WE THINK- THE PROPOSALS ARE REASONABLE AND GIVEN THE GENERAL FUND CONDITION HOWEVER JUST A COUPLE OF NOTES FOR OF ALL THEY ARE. ONE TIME SOLUTIONS AND THEREFORE- THEY'RE NOT BUT- THEY ARE LOANS- THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR USE. IN NEXT YEAR. THERE ALSO DID YOU A FUTURE GENERAL FUND ABA. TO REPAIR THOSE COSTS WHILE WE GENERALLY HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE LOANS AND TRANSFERRED AND ONE JUST A HIGHLIGHTED THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION IS THE FIRST ONE ON THE LIST THE TRANSFER FROM THE STATE HIGHWAY CAL. THE ISSUE HERE THAT THIS IS GENERALLY A FUN DAY IS A PROTECTED BY ARTICLE NINETEEN OF THE CONSTITUTION AND IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR NON TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES INCLUDING TRANSFERRED ALONE. HOWEVER THE INITIATION HAD IDENTIFIED A POSSIBLE EXCEPTION TO THIS- BASED ON. THIS AND THIS PROPOSAL THE TRANSFER OF INTEREST EARNINGS ON THE ACCOUNT WHICH IS NOT EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED AND- IN THE CONSTITUTION WORK CURRENTLY- CONSULTING WITH LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL TO SEE- IF THEY SHARE THAT SAME INTERPRETATION OF WALL. CIRCLE BACK WITH COMMITTEE ON ON WHAT WE LEARN. YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR THERE ARE REAL FEW. GENERAL AUGMENT. PROPOSED AND THE NEIGHBOR VISION OR RETAIN FROM JANUARY OF THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE- THE LARGER ONE MORE THAN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. I JUST A COUPLE TO HIGHLIGHT HERE THE FIRST TWO FOR PARKS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE- IN THIS CASE NEEDS ARE. COMBINATION CURRENT YEAR AND BUDGET YEAR AUGMENTATION MEANT TO ADDRESS ON GOING AND IN SOME CASES NEW COST- BUT THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO BE FUNDED BECAUSE OF THE REDUCTION REVENUES FROM REDUCE VISITOR SHIP AND AN ASSOCIATE AND SHE- AND THE INABILITY TO HOLD. AS MANY EVENTS. AS WE CAN BE REASONABLE ALTHOUGH EXACT. ESTIMATE ARE ARE SUBJECT TO SOME UNCERTAINTY. THE THIRD ITEM ON THE LIST THE CALIFORNIA RELEASE BACKING FACTOR PROPOSAL- THIS IS A PROPOSAL FROM JANUARY- IT IS RETAIN FROM THEN ON ALTHOUGH THE SOME OF THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSAL ARE MODIFIED. YEAH IN THIS CASE WE SIMPLY HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS IS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THE GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISION ARE RETAINED IN THE MAYOR VISION AND WE THINK THIS WILL BE A TOUGH DECISION FOR THE LEGISLATURE ON THE ONE HAND THERE IS- I THINK A REAL INTEREST IN. CONTINUING TO SUPPORT WILD FIRE EFFORTS OF WILDFIRE OF PROTECTION AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS IT AND IN ADDITION TO THAT OF COURSE THERE IS CONCERN THAT THIS COULD BE A PARTICULARLY BAD FIRE YEAR HELLO PRECIPITATION GOAL THAT'S THIS IS A LARGE IMPORTANT. I'M GOING GROWING PROPOSE IT RIGHT THE ENGINE THEIR FIVE. IN OUT HERE IN THEIR FULL YOU'LL HAVE TO WEIGH THAT YOUR GENERAL FUND. HE'S I'M ACTUALLY ABLE TO THE FINAL I. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH WHILE. THIS IS A RELATIVELY SO FOR FIRST MILLION DOLLARS IS TO EMPLOYEE. HOWEVER SOME. ACTIVE IN THE DEPARTMENT AND WE SIMPLY NO IN THIS CASE THAT- WELL WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERN WITH THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITY PROPOSED. IT IS A BET ON INCONGRUOUS WITH THE IDEA OF ALSO CUTTING BASED FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AS MENTIONED EARLIER. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF THE HAND OUT A COUPLE OF HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS BUT LOOKING AT THE OVERALL GENERAL FUND ARCHITECTURE OF A PROPOSED IN THE NEAR VISION FOR THESE AGENCIES. OTHER PERSON OVERALL WE THINK THE- NATURE OF THE PROPOSAL A REASONABLE GIVEN THE LOSS IN GENERAL FUND REVENUE PROJECTED. BUT WE DO NOT AGAIN THAT MOST OF THESE INCLUDING THE SPECIAL FUNDS LOANS TRANSFERS- AND FINE SHIPS ARE ONE TIME IN NATURE AND OUR OFFICE IS PROJECTING THAT THIS WILL BE A MULTI YEAR. GENERAL FUND- PROBLEM. BUT WITH REGARD TO THE BASS LINE BECAUSE I ALREADY NOTED THE ONE FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE THE OTHER ONE TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF IT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. THIS WOULD BE A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND REDUCTION BUT NOT IN THE BUDGET YEAR PROPOSED FOR. THE FOLLOWING YEAR IN BOTH THESE CASES WE YOU YOU MIGHT ULTIMATELY FIND THAT THEY'RE NECESSARY TO ENACT IN ORDER TO BALANCE THE BUDGET GIVEN LIMITED GENERAL FUND REVENUES. I THINK OUR MAIN CONCERN AT THIS POINT WITH BOTH OF THESE- IS THE LACK OF SORT OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO THE EMPLOYMENT AND THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THE COMMITTEE WANTS TO. CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON. ON PAGE SIX- JUST ONE MORE COMMENT ABOUT THE GENERAL FUND EIGHT IS THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE AUGMENTATION PROPOSED AGAIN WE THINK THERE ARE REASONABLE RATIONALE PROPOSED BY THE MINISTRATION- IN GENERAL FOR THE- HOWEVER. THEY DO REFLECT THE GOVERNOR'S SPENDING PRIORITIES AND SO WE SIMPLY ENCOURAGE THE CANADIAN THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT. YOU SHARE THE SAME PRIORITIES- GIVEN THE LIMITED GENERAL FUND REVENUES AVAILABLE THIS COMING YEAR. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE. I WANT HIGHLIGHT A FEW ISSUES RELATED TO SPECIAL FUNDS AND BOND FUNDS- THIS BECAUSE IN FACT IN THIS PROGRAM AREA. THOSE WHO MAKE UP MOST OF THE REVENUE SOURCES FOR PROGRAMS. THE FIRST ISSUE TO HIGHLIGHT IF THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN AS THE COMMITTEE MAY WELL NOW THE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT BUDGET YEAR REVENUES ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE. FROM THE CAP AND TRADE OPTIONS GIVEN THE DECLINE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND REDUCE DRIVING- THE MAIN REVISION INCLUDES ESSENTIALLY THE SAME. FUNDING PLAN AS PROPOSED ANYWHERE AND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FOR THE CALL THE DISCRETIONARY PROGRAM- HOWEVER THE NEAR VISION DOES ALSO INCLUDE. ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE WHICH UPRIGHT CLEARLY PRIORITIZE IS THE- PROGRAM THAT WOULD RECEIVE FUNDING FIRST SHOULD REVENUE TO BE LOWER THAN PROJECTED WE THINK ULTIMATELY THAT IS A STEP STRATEGY TO SET EXPLICIT PRIORITIES IN THE BUDGET- WE SIMPLY NOTE THAT. THE PROGRAMS PRIORITIZE ARE THOSE THAT ARE THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIES INSTANTLY THE LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES- BASED ON AS INTEREST AND- HOW IT WANTS TO BALANCE- DIFFERENT- POLICY GOALS SUCH AS- REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS- CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND- IMPROVING AIR QUALITY NEXT- IT IS BORN TO NOTE THAT THE MERRY VISION WITHDRAWALS TO. WITHDRAWS TO MAJOR CLIMATE PROPOSALS A FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR CLIMATE BOND AS WELL AS THE PROVISION OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR NEW CLIMATE CATALYST FUND. WITH REGARD TO TRANSPORTATION RATHER I ALREADY MENTIONED THE DECLINE IN ANTICIPATED REVENUES- FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS AND PARTICULARLY THOSE- LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED THROUGH. THE DIESEL SALES TAX AND- GASOLINE EXCISE TAX ALSO WERE NOTING IS- THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. AND BASED ON PROJECTED DECLINE IN REGISTRATION- REVENUES THOUGH FUND IS NOW PROJECTED TO GO AND SOLD IN TWO YEARS SOONER THAN HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED. IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE NOW- AND SO THIS IS GONNA BE AN AREA THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR OFFICE IN THE COMMITTEES CONTINUE TO MONITOR. IF YOU TURN THE LAST PAGE PAGE EIGHT JUST- VERY QUICKLY A COUPLE OF OTHER I THINK ON A- FISCAL POLICY BASED IMPORTANT ISSUE THE NO ALREADY REFERENCED- IN THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. THE MAYOR REVISION CONTINUES TO PROPOSE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ESTABLISH A NEW OVERSIGHT BOARD INCREASED. AND ESTABLISH A NEW FEE STRUCTURE- THAT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT POLICY OR A FOR THE- COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER. ALSO IMPORTANT NO PRETTY SIZEABLE INCREASE IN PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT FUNNY PROPOSED IN THE MAY REVISION RELATIVE TO JANUARY- A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING THERE. AND THEN LASTLY- WOULD KNOW THAT THEIR MAYOR VISIONING PROVIDE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN WHAT WAS INCLUDED IN JERRY BUDGET BUT FOR TOTAL ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS- FOR THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION AND TO IMPLEMENT. THE NINE OH AND OTHER RELATED WILD HAIR OF LEGISLATION IT TO DO OVER. OF WILD. AND AN IMPORT. CENTRE RECENTLY ENACT. FOR DIALOGUE. SO WITH THAT THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS HAPPY TO. ADJUST ADDITIONAL BUT AS YOU CAN ON. THANK YOU I'VE JUST LEARNED THAT APPARENTLY THE PHONE A OR CODE TO THAT I GAVE A EARLIER IS. I READ THE ONE FROM THE AGENDA BUT A PAIR THAT'S NOT THE- MISS CHANCE. THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THAT OKAY I'M READING TO SEPARATE TO- EMAILS- I WILL IF IT IF IT THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH THE NUMBER IF IT NEEDS CORRECTION I WILL GIVE YOU AN UPDATE JUST AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE TRYING TO- GET IN THE QUEUE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND HAVE BEEN STYMIED THAT'S WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WERE ADDRESSING IT AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE THAT RESULT IN SHORT ORDER. ARE THERE A WILL WANT WE- HOLD QUESTIONS- UNTIL ALL PANELISTS OF SPOKEN SO NEXT WE HAVE MARK MONROE. THE ASSISTANT PROGRAM BUDGET MANAGER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER BROWN YOU'LL STICK AROUND FOR QUESTIONS. YES GOOD MORNING- THIS IS MARK ONE ROW WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AND- WANTED TO THANK THE LA FOR YOU KNOW. GOOD REPRESENTATION OF WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET SUMMARY THERE. THE ONLY THING THAT I THINK- I WOULD ADD IS- JUST A REFERENCE TO THE- THE FEDERAL CARE ACT WHICH DID PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL THREE POINT SEVEN. BILLION DOLLARS FOR LOCAL TRANSIT- AND THAT FUNDING DOES NOT GO THROUGH THE BUDGET THAT GOES DIRECTLY TO. LOCAL TRANSIT AGENCIES. AND SO- WITH THAT I THINK I JUST SAY THAT THERESA CALVERT ON MY AND MY OTHER COLLEAGUES ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU- MISS CALVERT. HI GOOD MORNING F. THREE TO COVER IT WITH ALSO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND HERE TO PARTICIPATE AND THAT THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AND- AS MENTIONED EARLY ON IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WE NEED TO FOLLOW UP ON WE WILL DO SO WITH BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFF BUT THANK YOU FOR HAVING US ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO NOW WE WILL MOVE TO. ADDITIONAL MEMBER COMMENTS IF YOU HAVE THEM- AND TO OR QUESTIONS. MR FONG. I'M THIS IS A QUESTION FOR THAT TO THE LA L. BUT- I'M I'M SURE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MAY WANT TO CHIME IN HERE BUT- CERTAINLY I WANTED TO DELVE INTO- WHAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED THE PRESENTATION ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISED PROPOSAL TO TRANSFER- A HUNDRED SIXTY TWO MILLION FROM THE ROAD PROJECTS TO THE GENERAL FUND- THE TRANSFER OF A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION OF THAT IS FROM THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT. WHICH YOU MENTIONED RAISES SOME LEGAL ISSUES SPECIFICALLY- I PROP TWENTY. WHICH STATES THAT. THAT THE FUNDS- PROVIDED SHOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM BEING SEIZE DIVERTED SHIFTED BORROWED. SUSPENDED AND SHOULD BE DEDICATED TO- FUNDING FOR LOCAL SERVICES ARE DEDICATED TO TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS- CAN YOU CUT A DELVE INTO THE MORE THE LEGAL ISSUES OF. AND IS THIS- BUT IT IS THIS DIVERSION SOMETHING THAT DOES VIOLATE- THE STATE CONSTITUTION. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES YEAH OKAY- YEAH SO YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE- YEAH STATE CONSTITUTION DOES PROHIBIT. THE USE OF- TRANSPORTATION NEEDS TO TRANSPORTATION FUNDS TYPICALLY FOR NON TRANSPORTATION RELATED PURPOSES WHICH I TRANSFERRED TO THE GENERAL FUND WOULD OF COURSE QUALIFY AS- YOU YOU MAY WANT TO ASK FINANCE FOR HOW THEY'VE INTERPRETED THIS BUT- OUR UNDERSTANDING IN TALKING TO THEM IS THAT THE- THOUGHT IS THAT THEIR INTEREST EARNED. ON SOME OF THE FUNDS IN THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT AND THAT THAT IS NOT EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED FROM BEING USED FOR NON TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES. NOT BEING A I'M NOT ONE TO PROP. TO OPINE ON WHETHER THIS IS IN FACT LEGAL OR NOT WE HAVE OUR BEST UNDERSTAND IS THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME THIS INTERPRETATION IS IN USE. SO WE'VE GOT WE ARE CURRENTLY CONSULTING WITH COUNSEL AND WILL- CHARLIE REALLY WHATEVER WE LEARN TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF. SO MAYBE THE QUESTION TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEN IS HOW IS. HOW IS AS JUSTIFICATION ARE YOU LOOKING FOR. DID YOU CREATE THIS JUSTIFICATION TO DO THIS OR- IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR TO ME THAT. WAY AND THE GAS TAX TO BE WHAT'S HAPPENING. THAT IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR AT LEAST FROM THE ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF IT THAT THE- THE DOLLARS WOULD BE GOING TO. ROAD PROJECTS AND THAT. THIS PROPOSAL BY THE ADMINISTRATION. BREAKS THAT PROMISE MADE TO THE PUBLIC THAT HE WOULDN'T DIVERT THE GAS TAX DOLLARS SO MAYBE DEPARTMENT. CAN I HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. CERTAINLY AND TO BE CLEAR PROBABLY TWENTY PROTECT THE FUEL TAX REVENUES. ATTRACTED A NUMBER OF TRANSPORTATION RVENUES THE ACTION BUT BUT IT'S IT PROTECTS ACTUAL REVENUES THAT COME IN- AND IT DIDN'T EXPLICITLY PROTECT THE INTEREST EARNED ON THOSE WHILE THEY WERE IN THE ACCOUNT. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRANSFERRING HRE. IT'S YOU KNOW IF THE INTEREST STATE IN THE- THE PHONE LONG ENOUGH THAT- THEY WOULD. BE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS WITH THESE THESE FUNDS IN PARTICULAR I THINK WE'VE HAD A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING INTERNALLY AT LEAST THAT- THESE WERE NOT SUBJECT ARTICLE NINETEEN PROTECTIONS AND SO WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THIS- BROADER BUDGETARY DILEMMA- SWEET. BUT THAT WE DECIDED TO USE THEM FOR THIS PURPOSE. OKAY IT SEEMS TO ME AT LEAST THAT. YOU YOU'RE VIOLATING THE SPIRIT OF WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE PROTECTIONS WORD THAT. YOUR PROTECTING THE FUNDS BUT THEN ANY INTEREST EARNED OFF THAT FUNDS YOU'RE NOW DIVERTING- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT- CALIFORNIA. RESIDENTS EXPECTED OF- THE PROTECTION OF THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT BUT DOES THE STATE PLAN ON PAYING BACK THESE TRANSPORTATION FUNDS AT A LATER DATE AND IF SO. WHEN WOULD THAT BE. SO NOW- THE PROPOSAL IS TO- TO TRANSFER THESE FUNDS PERMANENTLY- THAT FROM THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT- AND- IT YES. THE LA MENTIONED THERE'S ALSO FUNDING FROM THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION RELIEF FUND WHICH ACTUALLY WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE GENERAL FUND- BACK IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND. SO BOTH OF THOSE ARE TRANSFERS- WE DO HAVE- ONE PROPOSAL FOR TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR LOAN FROM THE- OF INNER AERONAUTICS FUNDING. AND THE LOCAL AIRPORT ON ACCOUNT. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T PROPOSED. PAYING BACK ANY OF THOSE TRANSFERS FROM THE STATE HIGHWAY COUNT. THAT ONCE IT'S BEEN TRANSFERRED THE GENERAL FUND. YES THAT IS CORRECT WE DO NOT. OKAY IT'S VERY TROUBLING- TO HEAR THAT AND I JUST THINK THAT- THAT SOMETHING THAT I THINK BREAKS THE PROMISE THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE MADE TO TAKE IN THE ADMINISTRATION THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION BATES- TO- CALIFORNIANS WHEN THEY SAID THEY WOULD. WOULDN'T DIVERT I GUESS SIX DOLLARS- MOVING TO THE TO- MAYBE TO RESET CAN ANSWER THIS IN REGARDS TO- THOUGH THOSE IN TODAY THE WATER THE WILL THAT THE STATE WATER PROJECT- AND- THE WATER BUDGET- I KNOW. THAT THERE WAS A I REQUEST TO. SHE ALLOCATE A MILLION DOLLARS FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THE BIOLOGICAL PINIONS- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS SUING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OVER THAT AND THEN IN AND NOW I GUESS YOU'RE ASKING. FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S THE STATE'S ASKING FOR. IT STATES SUING DEVELOPMENT TWICE IS A POSSIBLE TO SAVE THE MILLION DOLLARS- BUT I'M CENTER STAND WHY. THE STATE'S ASKING FOR MILLION DOLLARS TO SUE THE GOVERNMENT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEN THEY TURN GENERAL ALSO IS SUING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO AND IF I IF I COULD ASK YOU TO PAUSE BEFORE YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION- WILL GIVE YOU TIME TO CHECK ABOUT YOUR RESPONSE FOR A MOMENT- I'M GOING TO UPDATE THE PUBLIC WITH THE- INFORMATION. THE PHONE NUMBER THAT- HAD THAT I HAD DOES STATE BEFORE IS THE CORRECT PHONE NUMBER SO WANT TO CALL IN ON. BUT THE ACCESS CODE MAKE A NOTE OF THIS IS. ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR TWO ZERO TWO. AGAIN ONE THREE ONE FIVE. FOUR TWO ZERO TWO AND- HOPEFULLY THAT'LL RESOLVE ANY PROBLEMS THAT FOLKS WERE HAPPEN. THANK YOU SORRY FOR THE INTEREST. THANK CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YES THE ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN COST IS RELATED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S COST- THAT ARE AT. BEATING HEARD GIVEN THE AG'S OFFICE IS WORKING ON BEHALF OF THAT CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AS WELL AS KELLY. SO NOT AT A DUPLICATION OF COSTS THAT NEARLY EIGHT THAT THE PROCESS IS VERY FOR THOSE AGENCIES TO WORK WITH THE OJ ON THIS MATTER OKAY SO THE MILLION DOLLARS IS FOR THE FOR THE LITIGATION TO FORD AND FORT FORCE ENTIRETY REFERRED. TO AND TO TELL THE- I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN SAY IN TOTALITY IS OUR OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT THE LITIGATION BUT IT IS FOR BOTH OF THE AGENCIES OR ALSO COORDINATING ON THIS SO IT IS A- COORDINATED EFFORT SURE. I MEAN. I JUST TO BE CLEAR I MEAN I BELIEVE THAT THIS. WHOLE LITIGATION ON THE BIOPSY IS UNNECESSARY THAT. THE THAT THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER- TO DEVELOP- SOME TYPE OF STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS THE FEDERAL BIOPSY BE INCLUDED AND AN OPERATIONAL. I MEAN SO. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS A WASTEFUL COSTS IF WE CAN HAVE THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORK TOGETHER. TO FINALIZE THE BIOLOGICAL PINIONS ME IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OF WITHDRAWING THE LITIGATION- SO THAT THE MILLION DOLLARS COULD BE SAVED. BUT THERE'S NO PROPOSAL AS OR THIS DOES NOT REFLECT ANY PROPOSAL TO WITHDRAW THE LITIGATION IT. LITIGATION INVOLVES MULTIPLE STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES- AND SO IT IS EXPECTED TO BE PRETTY PRETTY TECHNICAL. AND INVOLVED MASSIVELY NOTICE ON THEM AND DISAPPOINTED THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE AGENCY HEADS- TESTIFYING IN AND SO I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NOT IN A TOUGH POSITION TRYING TO- EXPLAIN I'LL A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THE AGENCIES ARE DOING BUT- THIS CAN YOU. IT MAY AND IN DISCUSSINGTHE THIS TOPIC WITH THE AGENCIES CAN YOU EXT. KIND OF EXPLAIN TO ME OR TO THE TO THE COMMITTEE WHY THE STATE CHOSE TO ABANDON. THE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TRYING TO- GET TO VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO- DEVELOP A COLLABORATIVE OF BIOLOGICAL OPINION IN IN STAG GOING WITH LITIGATION. LET ME TRY T GET BACK TO YOU ON A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AND PERHAPS WHAT BACKGROUND OR HISTORY LED US TO THIS PART OR TO THIS POINT SO I CAN. WORK WITH THE AGENCIES TO FOLLOW UP AND SEE WHAT WE CAN GET TO BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFF TO. YEAH WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION OKAY I MEAN I CERTAINLY WOULD SAY THAT THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AND- OF. A BETTER COLOR. PROCESS AND- OF APPROVING THE FEDERAL OF FEDERAL BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AS WELL AS- A CLEAN INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT. WOULD HAVE. PROVIDED A MORE LASTING AND COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO THE WATER CHALLENGES OF CALIFORNIA AND WE WOULD TO BE SOMETHING WE WOULD BE SAVING A MILLION DOLLARS TO SO- IF THAT SOMETHING THAT. YOU COULD KIND OF SHED SOME LIGHT ON WHY THE GOVERNOR CHANGES PRIORITIES- I CERTAINLY WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. I AND LASTLY AND I KNOW THAT WORD BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ON SINCE AT THE TIME. I IN TERMS OF THE PARKS- BUDGET. I NOTICED THAT. THAT WOULD BE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS ANALYSIS SAYS THAT THERE IS A BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRED. PARK MAINTENANCE COSTS AND MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION FOR THE LA SO- AND THEN FOLLOWED UP BY THE DEPARTMENT AS IF THEY WANT TO FOLLOW UP. SO IT SEEMS INTERESTING TO ME THAT. FROM BUDGETARY PRIOR STANDPOINT. THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO. NOT DEAL WITH THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUT THEN AT THE SAME TIME EXPAND GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TO. PUT A NEW PARK IN AND TO EXPAND EXISTING PARKS- AT A TIME WHEN WE PROBABLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THE FOR PAYMENTS AND AT THE SAME TIME- THE GOVERNOR'S INDICATED THAT THEIR TRIGGER CUTS TO TEACHERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS I WOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD. TAKE THAT THOSE FUNDS AND EVEN PUT IT TO THAT CAN CAN DALY ARE KIND OF TALK ABOUT THAT. THAT'S RIGHT THE BUDGET THE NAY REVISION INCLUDES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW PARK- RIGHT NOW WE DO NOT HAVE A PROPOSAL SPECIFIC PROPOSAL FOR WEBSITE THAT WOULD BE- OR WHAT THE ONGOING OPERATIONS AN IMPROVEMENT COST WOULD BE. FOR ANY SITE- AS THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING REJECTING IT AND AS YOU KNOW MISTER FONG THE- PARKS DEPARTMENT DOES HAVE A LONG LIST OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. THAT HAS NOT BEEN- COMPLETED CRUDE OVER NUMBER OF YEARS. AND THE LETTER. AND YEARS OF THE MORE FOR THE AND IN A- PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT INCLUDES FUNDING TO ADDRESS- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN STATE PARKS AND SO THAT MAY REVISED DOES IN FACT INCLUDE SOME FUNDING FOR THAT- BUT ULTIMATELY- IT WILL NOT ADDRESS THE MAJORITY OF THAT ON GOING. PROBLEM. YEAH I DID IT. DOESN'T QUITE MAKE SENSE IN OUR MY- TO ESTABLISH A NEW PARK WITH A ACOSTA SHE WE THEY'RE OTHER CUTS BEING PROPOSED OKAY WHAT I AM. HI THAT ON I THINK THAT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF MAYBE SOME PRIORITIES AND TO BE A RIPPER REAR- REEVALUATED- IF WE'RE GOING TO. MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE YOU PROBABLY SHOULD STOP TAKING THE WHOLE AND MOVE THE MONEY INTO MORE- CORE CORE FUNCTIONS LIKE TEACHERS FIRST RESPONDERS- WE'RE DEALING WITH KIND OF THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE. I WILL- JUST MAYBE CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE TO THE LA OKAY TALK ABOUT THE- CAPTURE. AS YOU GOES AND JUST GIVE REVENUE TO THE CAPTURED BROKE COMES IN LESS DOES THAT MEAN ALL THE OTHER PROGRAMS AFTER THE TOWARD THE END OF THE PRIORITY LIST DO THEY GET NO MONEY OR LESS MONEY OR HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THAT FUNCTION. MAYBE THAT AND MAYBE DEPARTMENT FINANCE CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON THE TWO. THANK YOU GEN. YOUR SO THE WAY THE BUT LANGUAGES. DRY THEREFORE. THAT ARE PRIORITIZE FIRST FOR FINDING AS IT COMES AND- FORCING WILDFIRE PREVENTION. LOCAL AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS THIS EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN PROGRAMS THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM AND AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT UPGRADES AND REPLACEMENT THOSE FOR PROGRAMS. WOULD BE THE FIRST TO RECIEVE FINDING AS IT COMES IN FROM THE AUCTION. AS IS THOUGH AND THEY'VE AND THE FUNNY BE PROVIDED PROPORTIONALLY ACROSS THOSE FOR PROGRAMS. ONCE THOSE ARE FULLY FUNDED THEN THE OTHER PROGRAMS ON THE- LIST ON THE IN THE EXPENDITURE PLAN. WHICH START RECEIVING FUNDING AND AGAIN. THOSE WOULD RECEIVE THEM ON UP ON A PROPORTIONAL BASIS AS- WITH AVAILABLE- SO GIVE ME THINK PRIORITIZATION OF SOME KIND REALLY MAKES SENSE GIVEN THE HIGH DEGREE BUT OF RATHER. UNCERTAINTY HERE HM OUR MINDS ARE OF. HE'D LIKE. MEAN AS A LEAD. WHAT PROGRAM. ARE IN IN- WE CAN SURELY HELP YOU STRUCTURE IT IN WHATEVER WAY. MAKES MOST SENSE WHETHER IT'S SIMPLY TO TEAR LIKE THAT WERE MORE TEARS OF FUNDING- THAT MAYBE I THE FIRST. TIER OF PRIORITY SECOND HERE THIRTY EIGHT NUMBER. DIFFERENT LIKE YOU COULD STRUCTURE IT. OKAY THE VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU FOR I WANT TO THE IS RANTS WHO IS ON AVOID DELAYED AND- GETTING HERE THIS MORE WE HAVE JUST HER FROM LA AND TO. OF FOR. AND A BRIEF PRISON EACH MEMBER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT- IF YOU WANNA DO THAT NOW OR AFTER YOU GET SITUATED- OR IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. NOW IS THE TIME. IF I MAKE. PLEASE THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S DURING THESE TIMES. I'M PREDICTABLE TIMES QUITE FRANKLY THE WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR COMMUNITIES IN COMMUNITIES LIKE SAN BERNARDINO AND THERE ARE OTHERS LIKE SO MY COLLEAGUES ARE HERE ON THE WHICH CHAIR OF THE AIR THAT I BREATHE IN MY COMMUNITY WE REALLY HAVE TO DO SO MUCH MORE. IN THAT REGARD. IN TWENTY TWENTY SAMBAR DINO COUNTY RANKED NUMBER ONE FOR OZONE POLLUTION. AND NUMBER FIVE FOR PARTICULAR MATTER POLLUTION. PEOPLE POINTED OUT THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN CLEANER AIR DUE TO THE STATE HOME ORDERS. BUT MY CONSTITUENTS ARE STILL BREATHING THE SAME. SOME OF THE DIRTIEST AIR IN THE COUNTRY WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE TO CLEAN THE AIR FROM THE DIRTIEST SOURCES AND THAT INCLUDES LOOKING AT DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES. INSTEAD OF RELYING ONLY ON. D. G. R. F. FUNDS DIRTY ERROR IN A PUBLIC HEALTH IS A IS A PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD AND NOW THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH THIS TEN DE MIKE IT'S BECOME AN EVEN GREATER THREAT. STUDIES ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW THEIR POLLUTION EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM FURTHER LEADING TOWARDS INCREASED DEATHS LINKED TO COBIT NINETEEN. THIS ISN'T HAPPENING EQUALLY LATINOS MAKE A 53% OF ALL POSITIVE TEST CASES IN CALIFORNIA AND ARE DYING DISPROPORTIONATELY MORE COMPARED TO THEIR DEMOCRAT TO OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS. WE ALSO NEED TO DOUBLE DOWN ON CLEANING UP OUR AIR. ARE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS ARE THE STATE'S TOP CLEAN AIR PROGRAMS THEY REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM THE LARGEST SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION. THE SECTOR MAKES UP 50% OF ALL THE MISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE MAJORITY OF THESE EMISSIONS CONCENTRATED MAINLY. IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SUCH AS THE ONES IN MY DISTRICT. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN REDUCING EMISSIONS AT THE SOURCE. CLEANING UP THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WOULD OUGHT NOT ONLY EXCUSE ME CAN GET MY. CLEANING UP THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WILL NOT ONLY HELP OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED BUT ALSO BRING ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE. TO OUR ECONOMY. EACH DOLLAR OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN CLEAN TRANSPORTATION LEVERAGES SIX DOLLARS AND PRIVATE CAPITAL AND EVERYONE MILLION DOLLARS INVESTED BRINGS APPROXIMATELY SIX TO TEN HIGH WAGE JOBS. THESE PROJECTS ARE SHOVEL READY AND ARE WORTHWHILE INVESTMENTS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE THESE PROGRAMS. WE ALSO NEED TO PRIORITIZE OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS LIKE AB SIX SEVENTEEN WHICH I WAS PROUD TO CO AUTHOR WITH MY FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA. THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES A PRIORITY LIST OF PROGRAMS TO BE FUNDED FROM THE G. G. R. F. WITH A NEGLIGIBLE POTENTIAL FOR ALL OTHER PROGRAMS TO BE FUNDED PROPORTIONALLY. UNLESS EXCESS REVENUES ARE REALIZED DURING THE QUARTERLY OPTIONS. GIVEN THE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE QUALITY HOUSE ALREADY HAD ON THE HEALTH OF THESE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. AND THE CORRELATION BETWEEN POOR AIR QUALITY AND IT INCREASE IN COVERT DEATHS IT IS ESPECIALLY CLEAR THAT FUNDING AB SIX SEVENTEEN AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS OR MORE VITAL THAN EVER. I AM HOWEVER A HAPPY TO SEE THAT THE REFORMS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL HAS BEEN KEPT IN THE MAY REVISE. THESE ARE REFORMS THAT HAVE LONG BEEN DISCUSSED AND ARE LONG OVERDUE. WITH ROBUST AND GET ENGAGEMENT FROM THE LEGISLATURE IN THE COMMUNITY. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL MAY REVISE REFLECTS NECESSARY STEPS TO ENSURE THE FISCAL SOLVENCY OF THIS AGENCY. WHICH IS CRITICAL AS WE LOOK AT SEVERAL MORE YEARS OF LIMITED GENERAL FUND RESOURCES. CONTINUE TO WORK TO CLEAN UP TOXIC SITES ISN'T JUST GOOD FOR THE HEALTH OF NEARBY COMMUNITIES. IT COULD ALSO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL JOBS IN THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. I WILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS LATER BUT I WANTED TO JUST GIVE MY OPENING STATEMENT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- JUST TO BE CLEAR WE'RE GOING TO BE COMPLETING OUR QUESTIONS BY ELEVEN THIRTY MINUTES RARE SO- GET YOUR QUESTIONS READY. ALL RIGHT OF A LOT OF TIME LEFT- ANYONE ELSE HAVE QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. IS GARCIA. THANK YOUNG TO SOMEONE. QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF. FIND I APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE AT OR IF THEY- PRIEST REFER FOR THE SEE TO. LONG TERM DEAL WITH STRUCTURAL DEFICIT THAT WE HAVE A TOUGH GUY AND HAS OR IS CONTROLLED. FUNDS BOB. IN THE GRADE STEPS.

THANK YOU MISTER MULLIN QUESTIONS. THE THREE OF US. I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS AN ADD ON TO THE CONCERNS THAT- MY COLLEAGUES- DISCUSSED ABOUT AB SIX SEVENTEEN IMPLEMENTATION- YOU DON'T I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING AND I ALSO OBJECT TO THE GOVERNOR PROPOSING TO TAKE POLLUTION CONTROL FUND MONIES AND- THEM. FROMAIR POLLUTION PURPOSE THIS WAS A SOURCE THIRTY MILLION IN AND FUND FOR A BI SEVEN LAW YEAR. AND A SHOULD BE A THE. FOR THE PURPOSE AND THIS YEAR SO WANTED TO ADD ON A. I DO WANT TO KNOW WHAT CRITERIA THE ADMINISTRATION USED TO DECIDE WHICH AIR QUALITY PROGRAMS TO PRIORITIZE. GIVEN THE DISPROPORTIONATE EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IT REMAINS CONCERNING AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS THAT LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION ISN'T IN THAT CATEGORY. MS MS RICE I WANT TO- CLARIFY THAT WE MAY NOT BE GETTING ANSWERS AT THE HEARING TODAY THEY MAY COME TO US- IT THERE THERE MAY BE A AN ANSWER TO QUESTION SO WE CAN SEE BUT- YOU MISSED MY OPENING STATEMENT WHERE I LAY DOWN SOME OF THE GROUND RULES THAT UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE OPERATING UNDER TODAY.
