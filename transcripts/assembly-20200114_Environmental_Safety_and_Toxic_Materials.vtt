ALIGN IT WITH THE EUROPEAN

00:48:17.995 --> 00:48:21.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UNION STANDARDS ARM BUT AS WE

00:48:21.598 --> 00:48:24.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE DISCUSSED YOU KNOW THERE'D

00:48:25.002 --> 00:48:25.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:28.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FIGURE OUT. IN A SPEECH IN

00:48:28.372 --> 00:48:30.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SITUATIONS WHERE FOUR EGGS WITH

00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:32.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ESPECIALLY IS THAT DIFFERENT

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:36.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COUNTRIES- IN FORCE TO- THE

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STANDARDS IN IN IN DIFFERENT

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:37.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WAYS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE

00:48:37.648 --> 00:48:39.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SURE THAT WE- ALIGN OURSELVES

00:48:39.983 --> 00:48:40.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT AGAIN I THINK THERE. THE

00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:43.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INTENT- AND MY COMMITMENT IS

00:48:43.754 --> 00:48:47.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO. ALIGN THE STANDARD SO THAT

00:48:47.357 --> 00:48:49.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHAT. IT IS- IS SOLD IN THE

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:50.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EUROPEAN UNION CAN BE SOLD

00:48:50.994 --> 00:48:53.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AGAIN CALIFORNIA RIGHT AND

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:53.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE WE WANT

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:56.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO MAKE SURE WE- PARTICIPATE IN

00:48:56.566 --> 00:48:59.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE GLOBAL STANDARD NOW. THE

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:02.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OTHER QUESTION YOU MENTIONED A

00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:05.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WAREHOUSE SETTING A MINIMUM.

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:06.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OUR UNDERSTANDING IN FOR

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:07.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INCORRECT WE CAN DISCUSS THAT

00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:11.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
LATER IS THAT DIFFERENT

00:49:12.015 --> 00:49:12.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
COUNTRIES DO SET THAT

00:49:12.482 --> 00:49:13.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DIFFERENTLY. ARKHAM SO IT'S

00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:14.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
GONNA TAKE SOME RESEARCH TO

00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:16.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FIGURE OUT ARE WE SHOULD COME

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:18.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UP WITH THAT. AND HOW WE DO TO

00:49:18.822 --> 00:49:21.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FIND IT IF THE E. REALLY DOES

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:25.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE A UNIFORM. ADEFINITION I

00:49:25.996 --> 00:49:26.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WILL CERTAINLY WORK TO MAKE

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:27.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SURE THAT THAT'S PUT IN THE

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BILL. ARE AS WE BELIEVE AT THE

00:49:29.733 --> 00:49:31.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MOMENT THEY DON'T HAVE A

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:34.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UNIFORM DEFINITION OF WHAT IT

00:49:34.237 --> 00:49:38.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO MINIMUS AMOUNT IS- AND IT'S

00:49:38.241 --> 00:49:40.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DONE BY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND

00:49:41.044 --> 00:49:44.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WELL TO FIX SOMETHING THAT.

00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:45.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RIGHT NOW THAT'S THE REASON I

00:49:45.782 --> 00:49:48.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
HAVE WE ARE INVOLVED FOR

00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:48.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
INCORRECT WE CAN TALK ABOUT

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:52.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT. I WILL ALSO SAY THAT IF

00:49:52.556 --> 00:49:54.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU HAVE BETTER WRITE THIS BELL.

00:49:54.391 --> 00:49:55.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO LET US KNOW AND WE WILL TAKE

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:56.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
A LOOK AT SO THERE MAY BE A

00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:58.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BETTER WAY TO WRITE IT- I WILL

00:49:58.595 --> 00:50:01.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ALSO SAY THAT WE'RE NOT BANNING

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:05.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHEMICALS ONE BY ONE THE WHOLE

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:06.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WITHOUT DOING SCIENCE. THE

00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:08.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHOLE REASON FOR WITH THE

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:11.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
STANDARD IS. THIS IS

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:14.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRADITIONAL INDUSTRY IN EUROPE.

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:16.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEY KNOW THIS BETTER THAN WE

00:50:16.313 --> 00:50:19.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DO BETTER THAN THE FTA AND

00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:20.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FRANKLY GREEN CHEMISTRY IS

00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:29.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KINDA CONSTIPATED. AT ANY THAT

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:36.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
JUST CAME OUT BUT. IT REALLY IS

00:50:36.299 --> 00:50:39.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OUR INTENTION TO USE SCIENCE

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:40.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR THE

00:50:41.037 --> 00:50:42.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
U. STANDARDS AND I BELIEVE THAT

00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:45.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIS IS. OUR IN LINE CERTAINLY

00:50:45.509 --> 00:50:46.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WITH THE INTENTION OF THE

00:50:46.676 --> 00:50:48.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LEGISLATURE NOT TO BAN THINGS

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:50.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ONE BY ONE WITHOUT GOOD

00:50:50.213 --> 00:50:52.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SCIENCE. THE WHOLE THING HERE

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:55.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS TO USE THE E. U. STANDARD

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:56.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AND I THINK THAT'S VERY

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
APPROPRIATE- I NOW LIKE TO OPEN

00:50:59.589 --> 00:51:01.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIS UP. A FIRST I JUST WANT TO

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:03.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE. OUR

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:08.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COMMITTEE. BECAUSE WE GOT ALL

00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:09.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SORTS OF QUESTIONS BEFORE THIS

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:12.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAME UP. LAST YEAR WE GOT THEM

00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:13.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND AS A RESULT OF WHAT THE

00:51:13.837 --> 00:51:16.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMITTEE MEMBER SAID YOU AND I

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:18.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WERE WILLING TO DELAY THE BAIL.

00:51:18.975 --> 00:51:21.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE COMMITTEE IS JUST THE CHAIR

00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:24.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMMITTEE DEPENDS UPON MEMBERS

00:51:24.247 --> 00:51:26.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BRINGING UP THEIR CONCERNS AND

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:29.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S WHAT THESE MEMBERS DO.

00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:31.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND WE'RE A MUCH STRONGER

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:32.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

00:51:45.068 --> 00:51:48.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS WARRANTED FOR SURE- I WAS

00:51:48.138 --> 00:51:49.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TALKING WITH MY STAFF EARLIER

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:51.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ABOUT THE FACT THAT- WOMEN

CLEARLY PARTICIPATE MORE IN THE

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:55.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COSMETICS INDUSTRY THAN MEN DO

00:51:55.712 --> 00:51:58.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO WE'RE PUTTING THINGS. ON

TIME. I DON'T KNOW DO WE KNOW

00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:24.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

I'VE BEEN HAVING ABOUT THE

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:19.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMMITTEE BE AMENDMENTS TO THE

00:53:20.063 --> 00:53:21.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BILL SO IN THE COMMITTEE

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:22.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ANALYSIS THE NEW SECTION E.

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:24.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT'S BEING ADDED SAYS AROUND

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:26.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PHRASE FOR TIME IF ANY COSMETIC

00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:27.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PRODUCT MADE THREE GOOD

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:30.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MANUFACTURING. IS INTENDED TO

00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:31.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COMPLY WITH THIS PART COULD

00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:34.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONTAIN CHEMICAL THAT IS NOT

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
INTENTIONALLY ADDED IN

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:36.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TECHNICALLY UNAVOIDABLE THE

00:53:36.446 --> 00:53:37.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CHEMICAL SHOULD NOW BECAUSE BUT

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:38.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO BE CONSIDERED ADULTERATED

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:40.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OKAY SO MY QUESTION IS GOOD

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:45.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MANUFACTURING PROCESSES- THAT'S

00:53:45.255 --> 00:53:45.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
NOT. SOMETHING THAT I AM

00:53:45.755 --> 00:53:46.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FAMILIAR WITH IS THAT A TERM OF

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:49.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ART LISA WE'VE DECIDED TO TAKE.

00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:50.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AS WE GO FORWARD AND JUST SAY

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:53.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MANUFACTURING PROCESSES SO THAT

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE DON'T OF YOU KNOW. WORKING

00:53:55.966 --> 00:53:58.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MANY YEARS IN THE INTELLIGENCE

00:53:58.101 --> 00:53:58.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMMUNITY WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO

00:53:59.002 --> 00:54:02.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COME UP WITH CONSENSUS WE OFTEN

00:54:02.806 --> 00:54:03.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FOUND THE BEST THING TO DO IS

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:07.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO TAKE OUT THE ADJECTIVES. UP

00:54:07.611 --> 00:54:09.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT SO JUST

00:54:09.546 --> 00:54:10.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
JUST TO BE CLEAR SO THE

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT DELETES THE

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:13.617 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WORD GOOD WELL WILL I DON'T

00:54:13.683 --> 00:54:16.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
KNOW IS IT IN THE CURRENT

00:54:16.186 --> 00:54:16.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AMENDMENT OR WOULD SOMETHING

00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:17.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE'RE GOING TO ASK. LATER YEAH

00:54:17.554 --> 00:54:21.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I GOT HAD. THE REASON EIGHT USE

00:54:21.358 --> 00:54:23.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE WORDS GOOD MANUFACTURING IS

00:54:23.393 --> 00:54:24.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BECAUSE THAT IS WITHIN YOUR

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:27.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
REFLECTION OF- ARTICLE

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:27.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SEVENTEEN IN THE U. COSMETIC

00:54:27.864 --> 00:54:30.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REGULATION WHICH IS THE ARTICLE

00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:31.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SEVENTEEN IS THE SAFE HARBOR

00:54:31.701 --> 00:54:32.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PROVISION AND THAT RIGHT IN

00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:34.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT REGULATION- THE LANGUAGE

00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:35.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:38.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
NOT VERBATIM. THE ARTICLE

00:54:38.141 --> 00:54:38.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
SEVENTEEN BUT GOOD

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:40.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MANUFACTURING IS A REFLECTION

00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:42.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
OF THE WAY IT'S DRAFTED IN

00:54:42.946 --> 00:54:45.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ARTICLE SEVENTEEN- HOWEVER

00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:47.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE DOCTOR QUIRK JUST SAID

00:54:47.917 --> 00:54:48.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT'S NOT DEFINING THAT'S

00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:50.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONFUSING FOR CALIFORNIA LAW-

00:54:50.286 --> 00:54:52.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WERE- MEETING THE WORD GOOD AND

00:54:52.656 --> 00:54:53.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
JUST MANUFACTURING PROCESSES

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:57.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND IF IT'S NOT PERFECT THE

00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:00.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AUTHOR CAN CONTINUE TO REFINE

00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:02.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOW THIS PROVISION AS RIGHT. AS

00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:04.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S PAST OF THE CAN. THE WORD

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:09.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GOOD IS NOT. THANK RIGHT UP I

00:55:09.439 --> 00:55:12.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAD A QUESTION ABOUT. I GUESS

00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:16.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROCESS SO YOU KNOW HERE WE ARE

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:17.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DEFINING A LIST OF THIRTEEN

00:55:17.213 --> 00:55:17.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHEMICALS THAT WERE SAYING IT

00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:19.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT IS FOR SURE WINNER PERCENT

00:55:19.315 --> 00:55:19.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NOT PERMISSIBLE TO HAVE IN

00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:20.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COSMETICS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA

00:55:20.483 --> 00:55:21.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT THEN WE ARE EMPOWERING THE

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:22.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

00:55:22.318 --> 00:55:24.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTH TO ON THEIR OWN THROUGH

00:55:24.454 --> 00:55:26.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REGULATION IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY

00:55:26.656 --> 00:55:28.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MORE CHEMICALS THAT MIGHT NOT

00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:30.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BE APPROPRIATE SO TO ME THAT

00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:32.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE WAY.

00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:33.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SPLITTING THE BABY IT EITHER WE

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ARE. EXERCISE LEGISLATIVE

00:55:35.298 --> 00:55:37.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OVERSIGHT THESE ARE THE

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:38.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CHEMICALS THAT THE SCIENCE

00:55:38.234 --> 00:55:40.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SUPPORTS BANNING WAR WE ARE

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:42.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POINTING TO THE CALIFORNIA PART

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:44.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAYING

00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:46.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU GUYS THE EXPERT YOU DECIDE

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:48.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT TO DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME

00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:49.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SEEMS A LITTLE ODD TO ME I

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:50.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WONDERED IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:51.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
YOUR REASONING ON THAT.

00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:56.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CERTAINLY SO WE HEARD. V.

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OPPOSITION THAT. THEY ARE

00:55:58.688 --> 00:56:00.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOOKING FOR. I WOULD SUPPORT A

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GLOBAL STANDARD. AND SO THAT'S

00:56:02.592 --> 00:56:06.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHY SUPPORT MIGHT BE A LITTLE

00:56:06.262 --> 00:56:06.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STRONG BUTTON IT'S CERTAINLY

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:08.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOMETHING THAT PREFERRED. AND

00:56:08.965 --> 00:56:11.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO. THAT THAT IS- AND THAT IS

00:56:12.035 --> 00:56:14.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MY INTENT AND WITH THE CHAIRED

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:17.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STRONG SUGGESTION THAT WE BASE

00:56:17.073 --> 00:56:20.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT ON THE GLOBAL STANDARDOF

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE EUROPEAN UNION STANDARD

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:23.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARM. THAT IS WHY FOR EXAMPLE

00:56:23.346 --> 00:56:26.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT THAT LANGUAGE AS A- THE

00:56:26.683 --> 00:56:28.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMMITTEE CONSULTANT EXPLAINED

00:56:28.918 --> 00:56:31.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN A WAS BASED ON- THE LANGUAGE

00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:33.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AND- THE EUROPEAN UNION

00:56:33.723 --> 00:56:38.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REGULATE AN ARM. BECAUSE WE ARE

00:56:38.428 --> 00:56:39.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BASED ON THE STATE ENTERED AND

00:56:39.496 --> 00:56:42.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOT BASE WHAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:56:42.332 --> 00:56:45.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW WITH WHO IN THIS CASE

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:49.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WERE AGREEING WITH A. WITH THE

00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:50.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REPRESENTED FROM THE PERSONAL

00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:53.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CARE PROP. THAT WE WERE NOT

00:56:53.476 --> 00:56:54.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TAKING A CHEMICAL BY CHEMICAL

00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:54.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
APPROACH BUT RATHER WE ARE

00:56:54.744 --> 00:56:58.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BASING THE BAN ON WHAT IS THE

00:56:58.414 --> 00:57:00.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCIENCE ACCORDING TO THE EUROPE

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:04.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UNION AND SO A LOT OF THAT SAME

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
LOGIC YOU KNOW FOR EIGHTY

00:57:07.157 --> 00:57:08.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POTENTIAL FUTURE CHEMICAL. AND

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:11.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ARMED AND I SPOKE WITH GARCIA

00:57:11.327 --> 00:57:12.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ABOUT THAT MY COMMITMENT TO

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:14.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT- ANY FUTURE CHEMICALS DAD

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:16.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WOULD BE STRICTLY LIMITED TO

00:57:16.699 --> 00:57:19.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THOSE THAT ARE BANNED BY THE

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:24.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EUROPEAN UNION BUT AGAIN YOU

00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:27.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
KNOW THE SITE AND SPEAKS. UP

00:57:27.076 --> 00:57:31.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
APPROACH TO THAT TO THAT WE ARE.

00:57:32.048 --> 00:57:32.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ADOPT SO IT'S NOT UP TO THE

00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:33.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:57:33.183 --> 00:57:34.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S NOT UP TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:36.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT IT'S UP TO THE- EUROPEAN

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:39.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
UNION. AND RIGHT IN THAT

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:40.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AMENDMENT- WE'VE TAKEN OUT THE

00:57:40.423 --> 00:57:40.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
LANGUAGE WITH A LIST OF

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:42.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CHEMICALS AND WE'RE JUST SAYING

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:44.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT THEY CAN ADD SOMETHING IF

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:45.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS ADDED

00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:48.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS

00:57:48.264 --> 00:57:50.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THING FROZEN IN TIME AND HAVE

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:57:52.502 --> 00:57:54.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EVERY TIME THERE'S A CHANGE IN

00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:55.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT HE'S

00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:57.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TAKING AN AMENDMENT WHICH WILL

00:57:57.607 --> 00:58:01.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SAY. THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:04.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONSTRICT LEE ADD ONLY THINGS

00:58:04.981 --> 00:58:05.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHICH THE EUROPEAN UNION. HAVE

00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:14.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AT. SO AS I SAID. ARE YOU GOOD

00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:16.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO ARE

COMMITMENTS I LOOK FORWARD TO

00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:38.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SEEING THEM IN IN BLACK AND

00:59:38.908 --> 00:59:40.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHITE WITHIN THE BILL ITSELF-

00:59:40.176 --> 00:59:40.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ARE YOU ALSO PLANNING ANY

00:59:40.843 --> 00:59:42.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SAFEGUARDS IN CASE THE E. U.

CHANGES ITS PROCESS ON WHAT

00:59:44.681 --> 00:59:45.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THEY'RE LOOKING AT- BECAUSE

00:59:45.648 --> 00:59:47.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RIGHT NOW THE WAY THEY'RE DOING

00:59:47.717 --> 00:59:48.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEIR SYSTEM. MY MAKES SENSE

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:49.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT THEY CAN ALWAYS CHANGE HOW

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:51.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEY'RE DOING THINGS- SO I

00:59:51.688 --> 00:59:52.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THINK WE NEED TO SAFEGUARD

00:59:52.555 --> 00:59:54.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROVISION AND THAT- IF THAT'S

00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:56.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE DIRECTION THAT IT'S GOING

00:59:56.526 --> 00:59:58.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS IN

TO COME OUT WITH NEXT SO I

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
