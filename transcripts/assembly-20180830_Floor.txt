THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL STATES THAT A MEMBER MAY HAVE A RENT ANOTHER RESIDENTS AT WHICH A MEMBER HAS ITEMS OF PERSONAL PROPERTY PAYS UTILITY BILL RECEIVES MAIL. OR REGISTERS A CAR BOAT MEMBERS IT'S GONNA CAUSE A LOT OF CONFUSION TO APPLY IN THE LAW THAT A PERSON CAN BE A RESIDENT. AT A HOUSE OF HIS FRIEND WHERE HE PARKS HIS BOAT AND THEN USE THAT VOTE TO CLAIM HE IS A RESIDENT OF THE DISTRICT AND THEREFORE CAN REPRESENTED IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. WE KNEW IT WE DO NOT NEED A BILL CLARIFYING EXISTING LAW WHEN IT'S CLEAR THAT SERA RIGHTED VIOLATED THE RULES BY NOT LIVING IN THE DISTRICT AND WAS FOUND GUILTY.

I FLY BACK TO THE DISTRICT ON THURSDAY NIGHT MY CHILDREN FLY BACK HOME ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND WE COME BACK ON SUNDAY BECAUSE MY CHILDREN COULD GO TO SCHOOL HERE. AND MY RESIDENCY WOULD BE QUITE. I LIVE IN BOTTOM PARK AND MY CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL HERE AND THE REASON THAT I CHOSE TO BRING MY SCHOOL MY CHILDREN WAS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE THEM WITH MY PARENTS. I AM A SINGLE MOTHER. AND I TAKE CARE OF MY CHILDREN AND FOR ME THE BEST SITUATION IS THAT MY KIDS ARE HERE WITH ME SO THAT I CAN GO HOME TO THEM EVERY NIGHT. IF MY RESIDENCY IS QUESTIONED UNDER THIS CURRENT LAW THEN I WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE MY CHILDREN WITH EITHER MY PARENTS ARE SOME BABY SITTER IN THE DISTRICT SO THAT I CAN COME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND DO THE WORK. SO THE REASON FOR THIS BILL IS FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO. CHOSE TO BE RESPONSIBLE I BRING MY CHILDREN WITH ME INSTEAD OF LEAVING THEM WITH THE BABY SITTER WITH MY PARENTS THIS DOES NOT. A AFFECT THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS IT LIKE THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER STATED THIS IS ABOUT [inaudible] QUITE FRANKLY.

IS NOT QUESTION IN THE FUTURE FOR THOSE REASONS MEMBERS I ASK FOR A AYE VOTE. MS GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. SORRY I THINK YOU MEMBERS AYE RIFF RIGHTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION. TO THIS BILL ON I THINK THE CONCERNS BROUGHT UP BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM BALDWIN PARK ARE VERY VALID AND SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD LOOK INTO. I THINK THAT THERE IS TIME -- AMBIGUITY THAT TIME ABOUT WHAT IS PRESIDENCY MEAN I AND I THINK THEIR SEMINAL WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT I THINK THIS. SETS THE BAR LITTLE TOO LOW THE REALITIES OF A LOT OF IS THAT THEY DON'T EXPERIENCE. MY COMMUNITY IS A COMMUNITY THAT HAS OFTEN BEEN USED AS A DUMPING GROUND AS A WASTELAND. MY COMMUNITY HAS HAD MEMBERS AT DIFFERENT YOU. BILLY DON'T RESIDE IN THE DISTRICT THERE WHEN WE DON'T RESIDE IN THE DISTRICT WE FORGET ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH EVERY DAY. I HAVE BEEN THAT PERSON WHEN I LEFT COLLEGE FOR COLLEGE I DECIDED TO MINE I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE LEAD ABOUT THE ARSENIC ABOUT THE CHROMIUM. SIX ABOUT THE DIESEL I DON'T CARE ABOUT IS THINGS THAT LIVE IN THE BUDGET BUT OUR COMMUNITY. AND NORTH UNTIL I MOVE BACK BUT ALL THOSE THINGS CAME BACK TO MY REALITY AND IT BECAME A PRIORITY FOR MYSELF AND FOR MY CONSTITUENTS. THE REALITIES OF MY CONSTITUENTS CAN CHOOSE TO MOVE ANYWHERE ELSE THE CAN AFFORD TO MOVE ANY I LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE. INSIDE THE BECAUSE WE LEGISLATE ON EXPERIENCE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE HERE RESIDENCIA THAT WERE LIVING IN THIS DISTRICT AND WE CAN'T MAKE IT EASIER. TO SCRAPE THE LA I THINK THAT MAKING SURE PARENTS ARE ABLE TO DO A GOOD JOB AND TAKE CARE THEIR KIDS INTO CHOICES LIKE MY COLLEAGUE HAD TO DO. ARE THINGS WE SHOULD LOOK INTO AND WHICH HE DEFTLY MIXERS HIS PROTECTIVE TO HAVE THAT CHOICE I JUST DON'T FEEL THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT WAS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AND NOBLE. THANK YOU MISS GARCIA SEEN NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM MS BURKE YOU MAY CLOSE. THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THE DOMICILE RULES OR LAWS IT CLARIFIES AND AS A MEMBER HERE WHO IS A SINGLE MOM. WHO DOES CHOOSE TO BRING HER CHILD HERE WITH HER WORK BUDDHISTS WHO FEELS LIKE SHE'S A GOOD LEGISLATOR BECAUSE SHE LOVES OUR COMMUNITY NOT BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T GET TO BE THERE MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY? MY MOM FOR OVER FORTY YEARS AGO HAD TO DECIDE WHETHER SHE STAYED IN CONGRESS OR WHETHER SHE SHOULD BE A MOTHER. I WILL NOT ALLOW MY DAUGHTER TO HAVE TO MAKE THOSE CHOICES.

WITH ALL THE STRUCTURES OTHER THAN THE MAIN HOME. SOMETIMES A GARAGE COULD BE. WORTH MORE THAN THE MAIN HOPE. THIS BILL DOES NOT REFLECT THAT THERE MAY BE OTHER STRUCTURES ON THE PROPERTY [inaudible] SO. THE BEST THING TO DO. IS TO ALLOW THE FREEDOM OF THE CONSUMER TO PICK AND CHOOSE WITH THEIR BROKER AGENT. THE DIFFERENT POLICIES THAT SUIT THEM. IF YOU MAKE IT THE INSURANCE COMPANY. PAY AT THESE LEVELS AND YOU LOCK HIM IN [inaudible] TWO YEARS. PREMIUMS ARE GONNA GO UP THESE COMPANIES WILL COVER THEIR RISK. PREMIUMS WILL GO UP [inaudible] AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN HIGH FIRE AREAS.

SP ONE ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT PUTS HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY ON PAR WITH OTHER AGENCIES CHARGED WITH CONSTRUCTING MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. SIMILAR TO CALTRANS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND THE UC SYSTEM. THIS BILL AFFORDS THE AUTHORITY WITH THE SAME RIGHT OF WAY ACQUISITION. TOOLS THAT REMOVED DUPLICATIVE REQUIREMENTS AND STREAMLINE OTHER PROCESSES THAT ULTIMATELY WILL SAVE OUR STATE. BOTH TIME AND MONEY. MEMBERS THE FACTS ARE VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD FACT. THIS PROJECT IS OFF THE GROUND IN IS THE LARGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS TO EVER BE CONSTRUCTED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. FACT THIS PROJECT HAS CREATED OVER TWO THOUSAND WELL PAYING CONSTRUCTION JOBS HAS OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY SMALL BUSINESS. IS WORKING ON THIS PROJECT AND HAS PROVIDED TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SIX BILLION DOLLARS STATEWIDE. FACT THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL WILL SAVE THE STATE MONEY REDUCE DELAYS IN ACQUIRING RIGHT OF WAY AND WILL CREATE MORE JOBS. LET ME BE CLEAR. THIS BILL DOES NOT REMOVE ANY OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS TWO OR PROVIDE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. THAT GOES BEYOND WHAT IS PROVIDED FOR OTHER SIMILARLY SITUATED STATE AGENCIES. THIS BILL SIMPLY PROVIDES A MORE STREAMLINED PROPERTY ACQUISITION PROCESS THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE AUTHORITY PROVIDED TO OTHER STATE AGENCIES.

IT'LL PROBABLY WILL NEVER EXIST IN OUR LIFETIME ALTHOUGH THE COST IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO RISE LESS OVERSIGHT FOR THIS PROJECT DOESN'T MAKE IT BETTER AND ACTUALLY MAKES IT WORSE. IF THIS WERE PUT BACK BEFORE THE VOTERS TODAY I WOULD. ALMOST BET THAT VOTERS WOULD REJECT IT THEY WOULD SAY YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT IT'S NOT GONNA COST WHAT YOU SAID IT WAS GOING TO COST. IT'S OUT OF CONTROL DON'T PUT ANY MORE MONEY TO INTO IT AND CERTAINLY ANY MONEY YOU DO HAVE AN IT KEEP AN EYE ON IT THIS ELIMINATES PROTECTIONS. FOR LANDOWNERS IT DOES ELIMINATE KEY OVERSIGHT WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WITH THE PROJECT THAT COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN IN WHAT OTHER PROJECT WHAT OTHER DEPARTMENT DO WE TURN A BLIND EYE TO HOW MONEY IS BEING SPENT WE JUST SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. YOU GOTTA GO HEAD WE TRUST YOU. HAVE YOU READ THE REPORTS AND BY THE WAY. THERE'S AN AUDIT PENDING WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO SEE THE RESULTS OF THE AUDIT BEFORE YOU GO PUTTING MORE MONEY AND LESS OVERSIGHT INTO THIS PROJECT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE OF THEM NOT FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE.

IT'S IT'S SORT OF A WE'RE GONNA KEEP GOING TO JUST HOPE THAT SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENS -- INTO I APPRECIATED THAT CANDOR BUT IT SHOULD BE FRIGHTENING THAT WHAT WE MIGHT BE PROPOSING IS TO TAKE AWAY OVERSIGHT AND TAKE AWAY APPROVAL PROTECTIONS. THE SECOND POINT THAT CAME FORWARD IN THESE VERY HEARINGS ON HIGH SPEED RAIL IS THAT IT WILL NOT BE HIGH SPEED. THE INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY ACTUALLY SAID THERE IS NO WAY. FOR THIS PROJECT AS IT IS CURRENTLY GOING FORWARD TO EVER GET NEAR THE TWO HOURS I THINK FORTY MINUTES. THE DID OF CONNECTING THE MAJOR DESTINATIONS THAT WAS SOLD TO OUR CONSTITUENTS.

LIVING OUT ITEM OF ONE NINETY TWO SP FOUR THIRTY NINE THE CLERK WILL READ. SENATE BILL FOUR THIRTY NINE BY SENATOR MITCHELL AND OTHERS NATALIE TO JUVENILES THANK YOU SOME MEMBER KAMLAGER-DOVE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FOUR THREE NINE BY SENATOR MITCHELL WHICH WOULD EXCLUDE CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN THE AGE OF DELINQUENCY JUVENILE COURT. AND OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF DATA HAS SHOWN THAT CHILDREN UNDER. TWELVE ARE INHERENTLY LESS CULPABLE UNDER CRIMINAL LAW GIVEN THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL IMMATURITY. pALL KIDS GO WITHOUT REPERCUSSIONS FOR COMMITTING CRIMES. INSTEAD SERVICE IS NEEDED WILL BE PROVIDED TO HELP THE CHILD NOT TO SIMPLY PUNISH THEM. THE MOST COMMON OFFENSE THAT CAN THAT'S COMMITTED BY THESE CHILDREN ARE MISDEMEANOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY WHICH CAN BE SCHOOL YARD FIGHTS. IN HIGHER PROFILE CASES CHILDREN CAN STILL BE WORDS OF DEPENDENCY COURT WHERE THEY CAN BE REFERRED TO SERVICES BY A JUDGE. THIS YEAR THE BUDGET ALLOCATED TWENTY EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR YOUTH DIVERSION PROGRAMS THAT WILL TARGET THIS VERY POPULATION. FOR COUNTIES THAT MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO CHILDREN UNDER TWELVE THESE FUNDS WILL HELP BUILD THAT NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE CHILDREN ARE STILL YOUNG ENOUGH TO WHERE WE CAN SHIFT THEIR TENDENCIES THROUGH DIVERSION PROGRAMS. WE MUST STOP CRIMINALIZING CHILDHOOD ELEMENTARY AGE CHILDREN HAVEN'T DEVELOPED THE FULL CAPACITY TO MAKE INTENTIONAL AND THOUGHT OUT DECISIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YEAH THANK YOU MEMBERS S. B.. FOUR THIRTY NINE DEFTLY GOES WAY TOO FAR. ELIMINATES JUVENILE COURT JURISDICTION FOR OFFENDERS UNDER THE AGE OF TWELVE ALTOGETHER. EXCEPT FOR THOSE CHARGED WITH MURDER ENFORCEABLE SEXUAL ASSAULT. IT PROVIDES A LAN FORSTMANN IS REQUIRED TO TURN A JUVENILE UNDER THE AGE OF TWELVE OVER TO THEIR PARENT OR GUARDIAN NO MATTER HOW MUCH HARM THE CHILD IS CAUSED. NO MATTER HOW MANY VICTIMS WERE INVOLVED. NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE JUVENILE NEEDS REHABILITATION SERVICES. THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT INCLUDES. THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. HAS A CASE WHERE ELEVEN YEAR OLD WAS CHARGED WITH CONTINUALLY SEXUALLY ASSAULTING. TWO OF HIS COUSINS WHO WERE AGE SEX AND AGE. TWELVE THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT THIS JUVENILE RETURNED TO THEIR PARENTS [inaudible] BECAUSE THE ASSAULT IS NOT CONSIDERED FORCIBLE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT TRYING THESE OFFENDERS AS ADULTS ARE SENDING THEM TO LONG SENTENCES TO JUVENILE HALL. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING AWAY THE TOOLS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HOLD THESE OFFENDERS ACCOUNTABLE. AND PROVIDE THEM WITH REHABILITATION SERVICES BEFORE THEY BECOME HARDENED JUVENILE OFFENDERS. THIS BILL JEOPARDIZES PUBLIC SAFETY AND ELIMINATES THE ABILITY OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE APPROPRIATE REAL BILL REHABILITATIVE SERVICES. AND I CERTAINLY URGE OR NO VOTE ON THIS [inaudible] THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- CARILLO. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL FOUR THIRTY NINE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A DIVERSION SERVICES THAT EXIST. THAT EXISTS OUTSIDE OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT ARE BETTER DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS NEEDS OF OUR CHILDREN. YOUTH RECEIVE TREATMENT THROUGH DIVERSION PROGRAMS HAVE AN 11% RECIDIVISM RATE FOR A NEW MISDEMEANOR OR FELONY ARRESTS WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER COMPLETION OF SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY 7072% OF YOUTH WHO COMPLETED CLINICAL CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES LOWERED THEIR RISK OF RECIDIVISM WITH JUST THREE TO SIX MONTHS OF SERVICE WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO REFER CHILDREN IN NEED TO THE SERVICES WHICH HAVE PROVEN. HIGHLY EFFECTIVE WE NEED TO LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE TERM AND WHAT IS THE REAL STORY IN OUR CHILDREN'S LIVES IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE BEST APPROACH. TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS. ALTERNATE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE BETTER SUITED TO MEET THE NEEDS. OF OUR VULNERABLE YOUTH WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING PUBLIC SAFETY WE DISCUSSED ON THIS FLOOR. THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE AND HOW SOMETIMES OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. INCARCERATE CY YOUNG PEOPLE AT RATES MUCH HIGHER THAN REALLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AND SO I I THINK THIS IS A STEPIN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR CALIFORNIA AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YES MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB -- FOUR THIRTY NINE YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALKING ABOUT A CHILDREN OFTENTIMES WE DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT IT. OF HURTING OUR CHILDREN AND THIS IS A BILL THAT BASICALLY HELPS US TO BASICALLY RESTORE THEIR LIVES THESE NOT ABOUT CORRUPT PEOPLE THESE ARE CHILDREN. AND THEY NEED OUR HELP WE NEED A RESOURCE AREAS THAT WE SHOULD BE REMOVING RATHER THAN PUTTING MORE OF THEM UP -- WE CAN PROVIDE THESE CHILDREN MORE APPROPRIATE SERVICES THAT WILL SHIFT THEIR BEHAVIOR AND PUT THEM ON A PATH TO PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. BECAUSE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT IMPROVING THE LIVES OF THESE CHILDREN. ACOSTA AFFILIATED WOULD PROSECUTING A CHILD IS EXTREMELY HIGHEST HIGHEST TO AND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CHILD JUST TO HOUSE THEM IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. SO NOT ONLY IS IT A PROSECUTION NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE LIVES OF THESE CHILDREN IS ALSO COSTING US A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND RESOURCES IS NOT VERY EFFECTIVE -- AS MEMBERS IT LET'S REMEMBER THAT THESE ARE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN OF CHIU A CHILDHOOD AGED THEY HAVE WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. AND WE NEED TO START TALKING ABOUT REDUCING THE CRADLE TO PRISON PIPELINE. I'D LIKE TO SIMPLY ASK THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS A THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THESE ARE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN. AND ADD YOUR OWN CHILDREN AND IF THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE DONE SOMETHING THAT WAS WRONG. WHAT WOULD YOU WANT THEM TO DO WOULD YOU WANT THEM TO BASICALLY INITIALLY HAVE THEIR FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE? WITH BUDGET WITH THE U. OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FIND THEMSELVES IN A DIFFERENT SIGN OF SITUATIONAL WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE THAT SYSTEM WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR CHILD YOUR FAMILY. TO RESTORE THEM BACK TO CLOSE THAT TO BE BASICALLY TOOK INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN BE PRODUCTIVE. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU AYE VOTES WITH THIS NOT ONLY FOR THESE CHILDREN THAT WE DON'T THINK ABOUT BUT MORE IMPORTANT ABOUT YOUR OWN CHILDREN YOU OWN GRANDCHILDREN YOU HOW YOU WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE. HANDLE IF SOME OF THIS HAPPENED FOR THE SITE RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE FOR S. B.. FOR THIRTY NINE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SCHABAS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. IT'S LIKE TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS -- BILL. NO MEMBERS WE TALKED ABOUT THIS WILL BE YESTERDAY NINE TO RESTATE IT. OUR SOCIETY IS REALLY SET. GO TO THE PRESIDENCY WAS GOING ON AND SEE ALL THE PEOPLE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE AND THERE WERE WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SOCIETY. LOOK AT OUR SOCIETY IS WE INCARCERATE TO ANY OTHER WESTERN NATION. WE HAVE A PROBLEM. WE KNOW IN EDUCATION THAT BY THIRD GRADE WE COULD SEE THE CHILDREN THEY CAN'T READ CAN'T KEEP UP. THAT IF THEY DON'T CHECK IN BY THEN IN EDUCATION THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA START HAVING PROBLEMS THEY PUT THAT ANOTHER WAY THAT'S AN EIGHT YEAR OLD AN EIGHT AND NINE YEAR OLD CHILD. WHO IS ALREADY FAILING THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER HAVE A FUTURE IN OUR SOCIETY? BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING TOLD BY OUR SCHOOLS THAT THEY CAN'T MAKE THE GRADE. WHEN I WAS A AYE COUNCILMEMBER IN OCEANSIDE I TOOK PART IN THE PROGRAM? AND WE TALKED ABOUT PREVENTION. THE VERSION AND INCARCERATION. THIS PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO MEET WITH YOUNG KIDS BETWEEN. EIGHT AND FOURTEEN AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE PATH THEY'RE GOING. AND YOU SAID IN A LITTLE ROOM WITH THEM AND YOU JUST SHARE YOUR STORIES AND LISTEN TO HIM TALK AND I CAN TELL YOU IN DOING THAT. FOR THE SEVEN YEARS I WAS A COUNCIL MEMBER. THAT I'D ALWAYS COME AWAY FROM THEIR THINK IN. IN MY CITY WE HAVE CHILDREN THAT ARE BEING LOST. YOU NO MEMBERS WE TALK ABOUT SOCIETIES. WHERE THE PARENTS? THE MAJORITY OF THESE CHILDREN THAT I SAW. THERE ARE KNOW FATHERS INVOLVED WITH THESE BOYS. OUR FAMILY STRUCTURE WE JUST THIS MESS. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS OUR CHILDREN YOU'RE JUST FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN OUR BRING. THAT'S WHY I'M A BIG SUPPORTER BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB. ANY THOSE YMCA THINGS THAT WOULD CHILDREN GO IN THEY CAN FIND OUT SOMEBODY CARES ABOUT HIM THAT'S DIVERSION [inaudible] THAT'S GIVE CHILDREN AN OPPORTUNITY THINK JUST BECAUSE I CAN'T READ AND WRITE AS WELL AS THEIR BI ELSE IN THIRD GRADE. MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING I CAN DO AND ARTS AND MUSIC OR OR TECHNOLOGY OR GAME YOU OR SOMETHING. WE NEED TO INVESTED MORE THOSE PROGRAMS DIVERSION SOCIAL WORKING GIVING KIDS OPPORTUNITY IN EDUCATION. TO WRITE OFF THE TRIAL. AND PUT HIM IN A CORD IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM WITH OTHER KIDS. WHO KNOW ABOUT TATTOOS AS I JOB BROWN WAS SOMEBODY I KNEW HOW TO TAKE I KNOW HOW TO USE A NICE? MUCH BETTER THAN A PENCIL WHEN I WAS A KID. THAT'S ABOUT THE LESSON YOU NEED TO BE LEARNING. YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THE ONLY KID WITH THE FAT PENCIL ON THE END TRYING TO DO YOUR LETTER REYES WHILE THE OTHER KIDS HAD THE MEISEL PENCILS WITH THE RACERS AND THEY COULD. THEY COULD THEY CAN ALREADY RIGHT. WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO THESE KIDS. I SOUGHT IN OCEANSIDE. IT'S MUCH BETTER. PUT PROGRAMS FOR DIVERSION. AS DATA INCARCERATION IT'S MUCH BETTER TO KEEP KIDS OUT OF THE SYSTEM THEN PUT AMENDED THE SYSTEM AND BRING IT BACK IN THE SCHOOLS. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND WE DO THIS I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. THESE ARE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN. AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN GET IN TROUBLE WHEN THEY'RE ACTING OUT. BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA THAT THEY HAVE INTO WORD AS LITTLE KIDS. CANNOT SOLVE A PROBLEM FOR A CHILD BY LOCKING THEM UP. BY. JUST TRYING TO LOOK AT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR LIVES WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY WHAT SP FOUR THIRTY NINE REALLY DOES IS IT PUSHES THE FOCUS BACK ON THE FAMILY AND THE SERVICES. THAT CAN ADDRESS THE CAUSES THAT PUT THE CHILD IN A POSITION TO HAVE MADE THE MISTAKE THAT THEY DID. THAT THEY DON'T EVEN NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND WHY OR WHAT THEY DID TO LOCK UP A KID TO THROW THEM IN COURT IS GOING TO TURN THAT CHILD AWAY FROM THE THERAPEUTIC REMEDIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE NECESSARY TO ADDRESS. THE THINGS IN THEIR LIVES THAT HAVE GONE WRONG. ADVERTISEMENT EXPERIENCES OR A DRIVER OF SO MANY NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS NEGATIVE SOCIETAL IMPACTS SO MUCH COST ON OUR JUVENILE SYSTEM AND OUR COURT SYSTEM DOWN THE LINE. UNLESS WE AND THAT PROCESS THAT HAS PUT US IN THAT PLACE UNLESS WE FOCUS ON CHILDREN AND THE THERAPIES THAT CAN HELP THEM AND THE FAMILY SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED THAT THOSE FAMILIES NEED. TO PUT THE CHILD IN THAT SITUATION BACK ON TRACK WE'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP SPENDING MORE MONEY MORE RESOURCES ON IS THIS NEVER ENDING CYCLE THIS BILL IS A IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION I HIGHLY. RECOMMEND IT AND AYE VOTE AS BEFORE. THIRTY NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MANAGE SPEAKER I THINK ONE THING IS MISSING FROM THIS DEBATE IS -- YOUR NEPHEW READ SOME OF THE ANALYSIS IF YOU LOOK AT DOJ'S OWN STATISTICS CHILLER TWELVER RARELY EVER. INCARCERATED IN A LOCKED FACILITY IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND IN FACT BEING UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE OF JUVENILE DETENTION. OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM ALLOWS. FOR REFERRALS TO SERVICES. IN FACT SOME PLACES WILL NOT EVEN TAKE SOMEONE. THESE CHARITABLE GROUPS THESE THESE THESE HOMES USED TO PLACES WHERE THERE ARE SERVICES TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE. THEY WON'T EVEN TAKE SOMEONE UNLESS THERE IS A COURT REFERRAL. AND IN THIS BILL THERE'S NOTHING THAT PROVIDES FOR THOSE SERVICES. ALL IT SAYS IS THAT THEY'RE JUST NOT GOING TO BE UNDER THE JURISDICTION. OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THIS STATE SO IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY PROVIDE THOSE OTHER WAYS OTHER DIVERSION PROGRAMS. IT JUST SAYS ARE NOT GOING TO BE UNDER THE JURISDICTION ANY LONGER OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM SO IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT I THINK. MANY PEOPLE WHO STOOD UP AND SAID -- IS THE REASON FOR THIS BILL DOESN'T SOLVE THAT ISSUE AND SO WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON HEY HOW DO WE IMPROVE THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING IN THOSE PROPER SERVICES WE SHOULDN'T JUST TAKE THEM OUT OF THE SYSTEM. AND HAVE NO WAY FOR PROVIDING THOSE COULD TYPE OF SERVICES. TO TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO MAY BE ON ALERT A WRONG PATH THAT EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM WANTS TO SEE THEM GET ON THE RIGHT PATH -- AND IT ALSO DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THERE ARE SOME VERY SERIOUS CRIMES -- OFTEN THAT THEY CAN BE THE CASE HERE AND IF WE DON'T. DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THERE'S NOT CONSEQUENCES AND THERE'S NOT THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES. WE AREN'T GOING TO GET THOSE PEOPLE BACK ON THE RIGHT PATH SO I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELINDA'S YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER -- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I'D. I DON'T DISAGREE THAT WE NEED -- TO LOOK DIFFERENTLY AT CHILDREN WHO ARE TWELVE AND UNDER WITH RESPECT -- TO BEHAVIOR IN CRIMES HE MAY HAVE COMMITTED. BUT I'VE I LISTEN TO THE COMMENTS ON THE ONE HAND PEOPLE ARE SAYING YOU NEED TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TYPE OF EXPERIENCE THAT THESE KIDS HAVE HAD. THEIR HOME LIFE A A LOT OF TIMES IS DYSFUNCTIONAL THERE'S VIOLENCE THERE'S DRUGS THERE'S A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS THAT CAUSE THEM TO ACT OUT IN THIS WAY WE NEED TO HELP THEM IN THE SAME BREATH. THE BILL'S SUGGESTS THAT THOSE ARE THE EXACT PEOPLE. WHO WE WILL NOW IN TRUST TO ADDRESS THOSE VERY PROBLEMS YOU CANNOT HAVE IT BOTH WAYS? YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S BECAUSE OF THEIR HOME LIFE THAT THEY BEHAVE THIS WAY. AND ALSO SAY AND WE NEED TO SWITCH WE RETURN THEM TO THAT EXACT HOME LIFE SAID THEY CAN FIX THE PROBLEM THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I AM I DON'T [inaudible] I AGREED. THAT SOME SERVICES NEED TO BE PROVIDED THAT SOME INTERVENTION CERTAINLY NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE. BUT JUST DURING OUR HANDS IN THE AIR AND SAYING GO BACK TO YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN -- AND YOU FIX IT APPARENTLY ISN'T WORKING [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. SEEK HELP I'M SORRY IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I KNOW. I THINK WE ALL ALREADY KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO VOTE ON THIS BILL AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT BEFORE WE CAST THE VOTE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND. THE FULL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS BILL IN A PEOPLE SEVERAL PEOPLE MENTIONED THE VALUE OF DIVERSION PROGRAMS. WELL HOW DO YOU THINK PEOPLE GET REFERRED TO THOSE DIVERSION PROGRAMS THROUGH THE JUVENILE COURT. YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO PAINT THIS FULL PICTURE WHERE. I MEAN I I COMPLETELY. AGREE WITH THE THEIR THERE THEY THE THAT THE BASIC -- IMPETUS FOR THIS BILL THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE PROSECUTING ó ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS. I EN AND SYSTEMS BUT IF IT'S COMPLETED THIS IGNORING THE FACT THAT THE JUVENILE COURT SYSTEM. IT IS A SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE. JUVENILE COURT JUDGES MANY OF WHOM ARE PUBLIC DEFENDERS MANY OF WHOM ARE FORMER SOCIAL WORKERS WHO TRIED TO MATCH UP THE KIDS WITH THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. AND SO TO ENTIRELY EXEMPT YOU KNOW ALL CHILDREN UNDER. SEVEN AT TWELVE YEARS OLD FROM THIS DEVELOP SYSTEM THAT TRIES TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IT THAT IS THE MOMENT OF THE STATE INTERVENTION TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE SERVICES INCLUDING DIVERSION PROGRAMS. ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE CHILD AND SO [inaudible] YOU KNOW. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS AT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS YOU'RE RECOGNIZE THE YOU MINISTER YOUR MEMBERS THE YOU KNOW I I HAVE TO AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I'M HEARING. YOU KNOW WE WE TALK ABOUT. THE THE ROOT OF THE BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT THE HOME LIFE. WE WHERE THESE CHILDREN ARE COMING FROM. BUT LET'S GET INTO THE DEEP ROOTED THAT. THAT THE FACT IS IS THEIR PARENTS OR STOCK WORKING TWO AND THREE JOBS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PUT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND FEED THEIR KIDS. SO THEY'RE NOT HOME GIVEN THAT QUALITY TIME WITH THE CHILDREN. NOW WHY IS THAT MEMBERS. MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE WE KEEP PASSING MORE AND MORE REGULATIONS WE KEEP LAYERING ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER. INCREASING THE COST OF LIVING ON THESE FAMILIES WE'RE INCREASING THE COST OF ELECTRICITY WE INCREASED THE GAS COST RECRUITING FOOD COST WE KEEP THROWING ALL THIS STUFF ON THESE PARENTS. AND THEN WE TURN AROUND AND BLAME SOCIETY. IN THE LOCAL CULTURE BECAUSE ITS SHELL BAD. MEMBERS IS BAD BECAUSE WE AS LEGISLATORS ARE MAKING BAD CHOICES UP HERE IN VOTING FOR NONSENSE BILLS THAT INCREASE THE COST OF LIVING. LET'S THINK ABOUT THE TRUE ROOT. STOP TRYING TO BLAME IT ON SOCIETY. LET'S DO THE RIGHT THING HERE LET'S KEEP THESE PROGRAMS GOING THERE WE NEED BETTER PROGRAMS FOR KIDS WE ALL AGREE ON THAT. BUT MOVING A PROGRAM AWAY AND BLAME IT ON SOCIETY. LIFE SHOCKS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR PARENTS CAN BE THERE FOR THEIR KIDS. STOP BLAMING IT ON EVERYTHING ELSE [inaudible] VOTE NO. THANK YOU MEMBERS IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONE. SOME MEMBER THURMOND YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THE COMMENCEMENT KERR. YOU KNOW MEMBERS ARE GOING TO DO WHAT THEY'RE GOING DO ON THIS BILL AMENABLE. FOR BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. TO S. B. REALLY DIRECT ABOUT SOME OF THE STATEMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE ON THIS FLOOR RIGHT NOW. TO SAY THAT WE HAVE A JUVENILE SYSTEM THAT IS DEVELOPED. IS A MISREPRESENTATION. YOU SAY THAT WE HAVE A JUVENILE SYSTEM THAT IS SERVICE RICH THAT HELPS ARE KIDS. IS A FLAT OUT. BOLD FACE LIE. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS STATE. WHO IN A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM? BEING IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM. PUTS THEM INTO A CYCLE. WITH A MORE LIKELY TO RE OFFEND AND WHERE THEY ARE LIKELY TO END UP AS ADULTS IN PRISON FACT. THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE TOUCHED THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE STATE. WE HAVE A RECIDIVISM RATE OF 70%. OR MORE DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE. AND LET'S BE CLEAR IF YOU LOOK AT A DISPROPORTIONATELY ALL OF WHICH YOUNG PEOPLE END UP IN THE SYSTEMS. THE DECISION FOR WHO ENDS UP IN THE SYSTEMS. AND WHO GETS DIFFERENT TREATMENT. IS MORE LIKELY TO BE BASED ON YOUR ZIP CODE. YOUR FINANCIAL SITUATION AND WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE. SO MEMBERS YOU GONNA DO WHAT YOU GONNA DO. I DON'T COME UP IN HERE AND SAY. THERE WE HAVE A JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT TAKES CARE OF OUR KIDS. IT IS A FAILED SYSTEM THAT NEEDS REFORM. AND THIS IS A MEASURE THAT IS SAYING WE HAVE TO FIND WAYS TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE WHO'VE MADE A MISTAKE TO LEARN FROM THAT MISTAKE AND TO GET A CHANCE. TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT THEY'VE DONE AND TO LEARN TO LIVE A DIFFERENT LIFE. LET'S BE CLEAR I SPENT. THE BETTER PART OF LAST YEAR WORKING WITH A GROUP OF TEENAGERS WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN A JUVENILE CAMP. THEY WORKED ON A PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE BETTER WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN THEY LEAVE A JUVENILE CAN'T. THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT. WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EDUCATING THEM. BROUGHT THEM WITH ME TO THE CAPITOL TO INTRODUCE THE BILL. PROBATION OFFICERS. THERE ARE MANY WHO TRY. THE BE SUCCESSFUL BUT DON'T EVER SAY. THAT THEY ARE THE SOCIAL WORKERS AND EDUCATORS AND CARETAKERS OF THESE KIDS. THEY ARE NOT. THEY'RE NOT TRAINED TO BE THAT. AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. DO WHAT YOU GONNA DO. DO IT BASED ON TRUTH AND BACKED. IN THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IF YOU PUT YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IT IS CONTRIBUTING TO A LIFETIME POTENTIALLY OF CRIME AND MORE CONTACT WITH THE COME A JUSTICE SYSTEM. I'M VOTING FOR THIS AND I HOPE YOU WILL. TOO SOME MEMBER KALRA. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I I JUST WANT RESPOND TO THE SUGGESTION. THAT THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET HELP FOR THESE CHILDREN THAT DESK WE NEED HELP IS TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT THEY MUST BE WARDS OF THE COURT THEY MUST BE BUILT INTO THE KERNEL JUSTICE SYSTEM AS OUR AB COLLEAGUE JUST MENTION. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE CHILDREN THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS WHY THEY END UP POTENTIALLY OF IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT WE KNOW IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE ABILITY TO BE A BILL TATUM THE BILL ITSELF RIPPERS ARE BACK THAT IT'S NOT LIKE THESE KIDS ARE JUST. GOING TO GO BACK TO THE COMMUNITY AYE AND NOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE REALITY IS WE NEED TO BE RESOURCES TO THEM AND SO INSTEAD OF SPENDING RESOURCES LOCKING THEM UP. OR HAVING TO GO THROUGH A VERY EXPENSIVE COME A JUSTICE SYSTEM INSTEAD WE CAN USE THOSE SAME RESOURCES TO BRING SOCIAL SERVICES TO THEM TO BRING RESOURCES TO THEIR FAMILIES -- AND RECOGNIZE THAT THESE ARE CHILDREN AND THAT UNLESS WE WANT THEM TO GO DOWN A PATH THAT AT THAT LEAVES THEM INTO PRISON OR WORSE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE CARE OF THEM AT THE AGE AT WHICH WE HAD THE BEST ABILITY. TO AND LET'S TREAT THEM LIKE THE CHILDREN THAT THEY ARE AND RECOGNIZE THAT THEY CAN BE REDEEMED IN SUCH A WAY. THAT. ONLY IF WE PUT THE RESOURCES INTO THEM AND NOT INTO A FIELD COLONEL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT IS BUILT. FAR TOO MANY CHILDREN OVER MANY GENERATIONS. THANK YOU ALL DISCUSSION AND DEBATE HAVING CEASED ASSEMBLY MEMBER KAMLAGER-DOVE. YOU IT YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE DIVERSE AND BIPARTISAN CONVERSATION WE JUST HAD SOME CLARIFYING POINTS IN MY CLOSING IF YOU WILL THE VAST MAJORITY. OF YOUNG CHILDREN CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF AN OFFENSE ARE EITHER EXHIBITING NORMAL CHILD BEHAVIOR. OR MINOR BEHAVIORS DID THAT DID NOT REQUIRE ANY JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN REFERRALS WERE MADE IN CALIFORNIA TO PROSECUTE CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF TWELVE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE NUMBER OF REFERRALS WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER. AT SIX FIFTY TWO OF THESE REFERRALS ABOUT 85% WERE CLOSED OR DIVERTED AT THE OUTSET SO DIVERSION WORKS BUT CHILDREN ARE STILL BEING PROSECUTED. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT DEVELOPMENTALLY YOUNGER CHILDREN ARE EVEN MORE VULNERABLE AND SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFLUENCE AND LESS MATURE THAN ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS. IN THE MOST SERIOUS CASES THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM INDEPENDENCY COURTS ALREADY HAVE THE DISCRETION. TAKE JURISDICTION AND PROVIDE A RANGE OF SERVICES AND SUPPORT INCLUDING OUT OF HOME AND REHABILITATIVE PLACEMENTS THIS BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE SEX CRIMES AND MURDER. ONCE YOU'RE WELCOME [inaudible] ONCE TOUCHED. BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. YOU ARE FOR EVER TOUCHED BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. I DARE TO SAY THAT MANY OF US. HAVE NEVER HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING ARRESTED OR PROSECUTED OR JAILED. AND WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY LUCKY THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD THE EXPERIENCES OF BEING TOUCHED BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE OUR PRIVILEGE. THAT WE ARE PROTECTING. IT SHOULD BE THE PRIVILEGE. AND THE FUTURES OF OUR CHILDREN SO WITH THIS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU.

THE REMOTENESS OF THE LINE THE LACK OF SHIPPERS IN THE EXTREME GEOTECHNICAL CHALLENGES ALL COMBINE TO MAKE RAIL IMPOSSIBLE.

SENATE BILL TWELVE SEVENTY TWO WOULD PERMANENTLY ESTABLISH A TAX RECOVERY AND CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE BETTER KNOWN AS TRACE. A TRACE TASK FORCE IS A STATE WIDE MULTI AGENCY EFFORT THAT FOCUSES ON INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. THE TASK FORCE WHICH ORIGINATED AS A PILOT PROGRAM ONLY CONSISTS OF TWO TEAMS HEADQUARTERS IN SACRAMENTO. RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATIONS FROM BAKERSFIELD TO THE OREGON BORDER AND LOS ANGELES RESPONSIBLE FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. S. B. TWELVE SEVENTY TWO WILL ADD THREE ADDITIONAL HEADQUARTERS IN SAN DIEGO THE BAY AREA AND FRESNO. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE STATE'S UNDERGROUND ECONOMY IS AS LARGE AS A HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND AS A RESULT THE STATE LOSES AN ESTIMATED EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION IN CORPORATE PERSONAL AND SALES AND USE TAXES EACH YEAR. THAT AMOUNT IS EQUIVALENT TO THE RAINY DAY FUND.

TO FIFTEEN AND WE ARE GOING TO PASS TEMPORARILY ON FILE ADAMS TO SEVENTEEN AND TO EIGHTEEN MEMBERS I BELIEVE WHERE IT FILE ITEM. TO NINETEEN S. B.. THIRTEEN OH THREE CORPORATE SENATE BILL THIRTEEN NO THREE BY SENATOR PAN AND OTHERS AN ACCOLADE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. KAMLAGER-DOVE. THANK YOU MISTER AND SPEAK MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT SP THIRTEEN HO THREE ON BEHALF OF SENATOR PAN. S. B. THIRTY NO THREE WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE OFFICE OF THE SHERIFF CORONER BE REPLACED BY MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE IN COUNTIES WITH A POPULATION OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR REQUIRE THOSE COUNTIES TO INSTITUTE A POLICY. WHEREBY CASES INVOLVING CONFLICT OF INTERESTS WITH THE SHERIFF ARE REFERRED TO AN ADJACENT COUNTY WITH A MEDICAL EXAMINER MODEL. S. B. THIRTY NO THREE IS THE SENSUAL TO ENSURE INTEGRITY IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND ENSURE THAT MEDICAL DETERMINATIONS REGARDING DEATH INVESTIGATIONS ARE SAFEGUARDED FROM UNDUE INFLUENCE BY NON MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. UNDER OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS CORONERS AND MEDICAL EXAMINERS ARE OFTEN CONSTRUED AS THE SAME PROFESSION WHEN IN FACT THEY ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. THE SHERIFF CORONER IS AN ELECTED POSITION THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY MEDICAL OR POLICE TRAINING. IN SHERIFF CORONER MODELS THE MEDICAL EXAMINER CONDUCTS THE AUTOPSY AND DETERMINES THE CAUSE OF DEATH LIKE CARDIAC FAILURE DROWNING. BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA EXCEPT AROUND BUT THE SHERIFF RETAINS THE FINAL SAY OVER MANNER OF DEATH Y. HOMICIDE. ACCIDENT NATURAL CAUSES EVEN IF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER DISPUTES THE SHERIFF'S FINDINGS. FOR MANY THIS NOTION IS INSANE IN THE MEMBRANE. AND THIS IS WHY TRUE STORY. DOCTORS BENNETT I'M A LIEU AND SUSAN PARSON RESIGNED LATE LAST YEAR AS SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER'S ALLEGING THAT SHERIFF STEVE MOORE UNDULY PRESSURED THE PHYSICIANS TO CHANGE THEIR MEDICAL DETERMINATIONS. INTO THE CAUSES OF DEATH OF INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN OFFICER RELATED SHOOTINGS TO ACCIDENTS THE PHYSICIANS KEPT HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF MEMOS. DETAILING THE ALLEGED ABUSES COMMITTED BY THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE WHICH INCLUDE PRESSURE FROM THE SHERIFF TO CHANGE HOMICIDE DETERMINATIONS TO ACCIDENT. IN ADEQUATE INVESTIGATIONS WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION AND BODY DISMEMBERMENT WITHOUT POSITION APPROVAL. THE ROLE OF THE CORONER OR MEDICAL EXAMINER IN OUR CRITICAL JUSTICE SYSTEM REQUIRES THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ETHICALLY. CARRY OUT THEIR JOB TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE NECESSARY FACTS TO DETERMINE FAULT AND DELIVER JUSTICE IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT THE SHERIFF CORNER MODEL FRUSTRATES THIS GOAL BY PLACING THE SHERIFF IN A CONFLICTED POSITION. OF INVESTIGATING ONE OF THEIR OWN MEMBERS. SWITCHING TO A MEDICAL EXAMINER MODEL ONLY IN COUNTIES WITH THE RESOURCES TO DO SO INSURES THAT POSITIONS PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT IS NEVER COMPROMISED AND CALIFORNIANS ARE PRESENTED WITH THE TRUTH WHATEVER THAT MAY BE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE SEEN NO DISCUSSION OR DEBATE I'M SORRY [inaudible] DOCTOR ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL THIRTEEN OH THREE AND I WANTED TO SHARE A THE CASE THAT WE REFERENCED EARLIER IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. THAT OCCURRED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH DR AMALA. IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE THE SHERIFF USED HIS POLITICAL OFFICE AS THE CORNER TO INFLUENCE THE MEDICAL FINDINGS OF THE CHIEF FORENSIC OFFICER. IN CASES WHERE OFFICERS WERE INVOLVED IN THE PERSON'S DEATH. THIS POWER OF THE SHERIFF CORONER ALLOWED HIM TO OVERRIDE THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHIEF FORENSIC PATHOLOGIST TASKED WITH PERFORMING THE AUTOPSIES IN THIS COUNTY. EVEN THOUGH THE SHERIFF CORNER POSITION DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY MEDICAL OR POLICE TRAINING. HOW CAN WE ALLOW? FOR ANY OUTSIDE THIRD PARTY INFLUENCE TO INTERFERE WITH OUR MEDICAL EVIDENCE BASED EXAMINATIONS ESPECIALLY IN CAUSES OF DEATH. THIS BILL REPLACES THE OFFICE OF THE CORNER WITH THE OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER WHO IS A LICENSED PHYSICIAN WHO PERFORMS MEDICAL AUTOPSIES. AFTER SUSPICIOUS DEATHS BY ENACTING THIS BILL WE WILL REMOVE ANY POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MEDICAL DETERMINATIONS IN THE CASE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER RELATED DEATHS. BY ENACTING THIS BILL WE WILL ALLOW PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED MEDICAL EXAMINERS TO DO THEIR JOB WELL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE [inaudible] DOCTOR EGGMAN. BUT THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS ESSENCE EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT MY COUNTY TODAY I THOUGHT I'D GET UP AND SAY SOMETHING AS WELL -- SB THIRTEEN OH THREE CERTAINLY CAME FROM A SITUATION MY COUNTY IN WHICH WE GET A FULL INVESTIGATION AND THERE WERE CERTAINLY ISSUES TO BE FOUND ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE. I THINK ANY TIME YOU HAVE BUT TO AND AM AND MAYBE THE ISSUE IS WE NEED A LOT MORE WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP I THINK. ANY TIME YOU HAVE A VERY STRONG POWERFUL MEN HOLDING TO POSITIONS SOMETIMES THERE ARE CONFLICTS A AROUND TERRITORY EMPOWER -- AND SO THERE WERE FINDINGS THAT THAT WERE LESS THAN CONCRETE I THINK ABOUT. A IF THERE WAS A WRONG THAT DOING BEING DONE UP BUT IN LIGHT OF THAT MY COUNTY TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES TO DO A FULL INVESTIGATION AND LOOK INTO IT AND HAVE SEPARATED THE TWO OFFICES AND ARE SETTING UP. A A SEPARATE CORNERS OFFICE SEPARATE FROM THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE UP WE HAVE DONE THAT WE ARE WORKING ON DOING THAT AS ANYBODY WHO KNOWS WHO HAS SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT THOSE THINGS YOU CAN'T JUST. FIRE TWITCH HER NOSE AND CREATE A WHOLE NEW DEPARTMENT IT TAKES WILL BE A TIME OF IT WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO THIS. I DON'T THINK THE OF DID IMPLEMENT. DOUBLE AS WE CAN DO IT IN THE MANNER A THAT THE OPPONENTS WOULD BE ARGUING THAT THEY WANTED DONE WELL AND PROFESSIONAL ó AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THOSE THINGS TAKE A LITTLE TIME. SO WE'RE ALREADY MOVING DOWN THIS PATH I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S CONCERNED ABOUT MY COUNTY A AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY BUT I AGAIN I THINK AB I THINK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR CONCERN. SAY NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. ON THE ITEM. MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS BILL SIMPLY OFFERS A WAY TO HAVE AN ETHICAL AUTOPSIES CURRENTLY NO SHARE HALF. ALSO HAS A PRACTICING MEDICAL LICENSE I WANT TO REITERATE THAT THIS IS NOT A MANDATE BUT SAYS THAT WHERE THERE ARE FUNDS TO DO SO AND WITH POPULATIONS OVER.

THE MOMENT YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING. FOR BEFORE US IS A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION [inaudible] SHOULD CALIFORNIA. HAVE THE NET NEUTRALITY RULES. THE VERY SIMPLE QUESTION. IN FACT BEFORE YOU ARE PRESENT. S. B.. EIGHT TO TWO THE STRONGEST NET NEUTRALITY LEGISLATION IN THE COUNTRY. AND WHAT IT TRIES TO DO. IS ENSURE THAT IS ESTABLISHES COR PROTECTION. OUR THE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN NET NEUTRALITY RULES UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA. IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE [inaudible] NO BLOCKING [inaudible] NO THROTTLING. NO PAPER IS ASIAN. AND NO ACCESS SPEED. A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO. WE ALL KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE PRETTY CLEAR [inaudible] TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. DROID THE INTERNET AS WE KNOW IT. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TO LEAD THE NATION. BY VOTING YES FOR THIS BILL. THIS IS IMPERATIVE. IN THE FIGHT. FOR A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET. THAT DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE CONTENT [inaudible] USERS. BASED ON HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE OR WHO CAN PAY [inaudible] FOR IN FACT. IT ALLOWS US. TO MAKE THE DECISION. BECAUSE WE CHOOSE. THE INFORMATION THAT WE GET FREE OF ANY SORT OF DISCRIMINATION. THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY. LET'S BE CLEAR [inaudible] TODAY'S BILL. IS THE STRONGEST. NET NEUTRALITY BILL IN THE NATION. IN IT WILL RESTORE. THE CORE PROTECTIONS LOST [inaudible] TRUMP'S FEC. REMOVED THE NET NEUTRALITY RULES WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY STRONG THAT MAY TELL YOU RULES. THE SAME RULES. THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S. TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN RULES AND ORDERS PUT IN PLACE. DAYS BILL IS ALSO ENDORSED. BY FORMER FCC CHAIRMAN TOM WHEELER WHO LED THE SEC IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN ONE THESE RULES WERE ESTABLISHED I URGE STRONG AYE VOTE. SO WE NOT ONLY SEND THE MESSAGE TO THE REST THE NATION. BUT WE ALSO STAND STRONG HERE AND MAKE A STATEMENT. THAT A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET. IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY AND WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT NOW. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. LET'S GO MISTER [inaudible] HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. THROUGHOUT THIS DISCUSSION I THINK THAT THE AUTHOR HAS ACTUALLY FRAME THE QUESTION WELL. NETS SHOULD CALIFORNIA HAVE ITS OWN INTERNET RULES SHOULD CALIFORNIA HAVE ITS LAWS THAT GOVERN THE INTERNET. OR SHOULD IT BE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OR SHOULD BE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IF INDEED YOU'RE UPSET WITH HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HANDLED THIS THIS ISSUE IS THIS SIMPLY VENUE SHOPPING. TRY TO GET TO WHERE YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE VOTES. TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE HOW TO GOVERN THE INTERNET. AND IF NOT HERE. WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE HANDLED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL PERHAPS WHY SHOULD THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HABITS. SHOULD THEY SHOULD OR SHOULD THEY NOT HAVE THEIR OWN RULES WHY SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO THE CITY OF OAKLAND. WITH THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO OR THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO OR ANY OTHER MAJOR CITY. OR MINOR CITY. WITHIN THE STATE. SHOULD THERE IN FACT BE A PATCHWORK OF MAYBE THREE HUNDRED OR SO MAYBE FIVE THOUSAND OR SO. DIFFERENT WAYS TO BE ABLE TO GOVERN THE INTERNET THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T MADE THE ARGUMENT PROPERLY. THAT SHOULD BE A FEDERAL LOCAL OR NATIONAL ISSUE. SO THAT I THINK REALLY IS THE FIRST QUESTION THAT WE REALLY NEED TO SOLVE IN THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE HERE NOT BE LISTENING TO WHAT FOLKS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY AND I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO WHAT. OUR CONSTITUENTS AND OTHERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN HAVING TO SAY BUT I'M NOT YET PERSUADED. AT THIS TIME BUT I'M WILLING TO LISTEN. TWO WHY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE THE ULTIMATE GOVERNING BODY ON THIS ISSUE. RATHER THAN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THAT OF COURSE THE SECONDARY QUESTION IS. IS THIS BILL S. B.. EIGHT TWENTY TWO INDEED THE BEST SOLUTION [inaudible] IF. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THE WAY TO BE ABLE TO GOVERN THIS ISSUE. SO WITH THAT I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING. OF WHAT THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS OTHER MEMBERS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS ISSUE. BUT LET'S BE LET'S BE VERY MEASURED IN OUR IN OUR DISCUSSION. IS THIS SIMPLY VENUE SHOPPING BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE YOU GOT THE VOTES. OR IS THIS REALLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THANK YOU MISTER HARPER MISTER OBERNOLTE. THE TOPIC OF NET NEUTRALITY IS VERY COMPLEX AND VERY TECHNICAL BUT IT'S ALSO VERY EMOTIONAL AND WILL USE EMOTIONAL WORDS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT. AND I'VE HAD MANY CONSTITUENTS COME TO BE AND SAY HOW CAN YOU NOT SUPPORT NET NEUTRALITY. HOW CAN YOU NOT SUPPORT A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET? AND RATHER THAN GET INTO THE TECHNICAL DETAILS WITH THEM I EXPLAIN MY OPPOSITION USING A METAPHOR IN WITH YOUR INDULGENCE I'D LIKE TO SHARE IT HERE. I TOLD THEM I IMAGINE. BUT THERE'S A VILLAGE BESIDE A RIVER. AND ONE DAY A COMPANY COMES ALONG AND BUILDS A BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER AND CHARGES CARS A TOLD ACROSS THE BRIDGE. IN THIS PRE CHEN SNOW BEING OF GREAT BENEFIT TO THE VILLAGERS IN THE VILLAGE THRIVES UNTIL MUCH OF THE COMMERCE OF THE VILLAGE INVOLVES CARS CROSSING THE BRIDGE. AND THAT LEADS TO CONGESTION ON THE BRIDGE THE BRIDGE OPERATOR ONE DAY SAYS WE'RE GOING TO INSTITUTE A DIFFERENTIAL TOLL WHERE WE CHARGE LARGE COMMERCIAL VEHICLES HIGHER TOOL THAN PASSENGER CARS. AND A GROUP OF ANGRY VILLAGERS GETS TOGETHER AND SAYS YOU CAN'T DO THAT WE DEMAND BRIDGE NEUTRALITY ALL TRAFFIC ON THE BRIDGE SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME. AND THE BRIDGE COMPANY IS A LITTLE BAFFLED BECAUSE THEY POINT OUT THE BRIDGE IS BUILT TO SUPPORT ONLY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEIGHT AND IF YOU HAVE LARGER COMMERCIAL VEHICLES CROSSING THE BRIDGE THAT MEANS FEWER PASSENGER CARS CAN BE ON THE BRIDGE AT THE SAME TIME. BUT THEY SAY OKAY HABA WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM A DIFFERENT WAY WE'RE GOING TO CONSTRUCT NEW LANES ON THE BRIDGE. THEN PEOPLE CAN PAY A HIGHER TOLL TO USE THE NEW LANES OR THEY COMPETE EXISTING TOLL TO USE THE LANES THAT ARE ALREADY THERE THAT WILL BENEFIT NOT JUST THE PEOPLE WHO PAY THE HIGHER TOLL. BUT THE PEOPLE WHO PAY THE EXISTING TOLL AS WELL SINCE THEIR LANDS WILL BE LESS CROWDED. BUT THE ANGRY VILLAGERS SAY NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT THAT'S PAID PRIORITIZATION THAT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL. SO BRIDGE COMPANY SAYS OR CAMP OUT THIS WILL COME UP WITH A PASS. AND IF YOU HAVE A PASS THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY A TOLL AT ALL. AN ANGRY VILLAGERS SAY ONCE AGAIN THAT IS ZERO RATING YOU CAN'T DO THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE THAT ILLEGAL. TO IF YOU ASK THE ANGRY VILLAGERS WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY HERE'S WHAT THEY'LL SAY. THEY'LL SAY YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW MUCH CONTROL THE BRIDGE COMPANY HAS OVER THE VILLAGE WHY IF THE BRIDGE COMPANY WANTED. TO THEY COULD PREVENT CARS FROM CROSSING THE BRIDGE AT ALL THEY COULD PREVENT TRUCKS FROM A CERTAIN COMPANY FROM CROSSING THE BRIDGE. BUT HERE'S THE CRUX OF THE STORY ALL THAT YOU NEED. TO DO TO PREVENT THAT FROM OCCURRING TO BREAK THE POWER OF THE BRIDGE COMPANY OVER THE VILLAGE IS MORE BRIDGES. ALL YOU NEED IS LOTS A BRIDGES CROSSING THE RIVER AT DIFFERENT POINTS AND THEN THE VILLAGERS CAN DECIDE WHICH BRIDGE THEY WANT TO USE AND NO BRIDGE COMPANY CAN TAKE UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AND YOU GET SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T GET ANY OTHER WAY WHICH IS FAIR PRICING. ON THE TOLLS [inaudible] UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL ENACTS THE HARSHEST REGULATION ON INTERNET OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY. AND WHEN YOU DO THAT WE'VE SEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT YOU DON'T GET MORE BRIDGES YOU GET FEWER BRIDGES. I WANNA TAKE JUST A MOMENT AND TALK ABOUT BUT ESPECIALLY PERNICIOUS COMPONENT OF THIS BILL AND THAT IS THE BAN ON ZERO RATING. AND THAT BAND GOES WELL BEYOND WHAT WAS IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FCC REGULATIONS ON NET NEUTRALITY. ZERO RATING IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE LINGO. IS THE PRACTICE WHERE A COMPANY PAYS INTERNET PROVIDER DO NOT HAVE DATA INVOLVED WITH A COMPANY COUNT TOWARDS CUSTOMERS DATA PLAN SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF YOU USE OUR NETFLIX TO WATCH. NETFLIX ON YOUR A MOVIE ON YOUR CELL PHONE. AND YOU PROBABLY WILL NOT PAY I HAVE THAT DATA COUNT TOWARDS YOUR DATA CARE. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT. IF WE DO AWAY WITH OUT FOR MOST OF US THE VALUE OF THAT DATA IS ONLY A FEW DOLLARS A MONTH BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE. OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY THE DATA SHOWS THAT MANY OF THAT POPULATION CAN'T AFFORD MULTIPLE ACCESS POINTS OF THE INTERNET SO THEY USE ONLY THEIR MOBILE PHONE TO ACCESS THE INTERNET. AND THAT IT ALSO SHOWS THAT THE IMPACT TO THAT SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION IS MUCH MORE DEVASTATING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. AND BECAUSE MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD IT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO PICK BETWEEN PAYING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN HERE OR NOT WATCHING NETFLIX AT ALL OR NOT USING THOSE OTHER SERVICES. WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THEM? WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THEM? THIS BILL IS BAD FOR THE POOR. IT'S BAD FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS IN CALIFORNIA'S BET FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. IT'S BAD FOR CALIFORNIA I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE MISTER FLORA YOUR RECCA. THEY GIVE US SPEAKER QUEST OF THE AUTHOR [inaudible] WITHOUT OBJECTION [inaudible] THANK YOU. THAT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT THAT THE OTHER CONNECTION AGREEMENT PROVISIONS UP OF THIS BILL APPLY ONLY TO EXISTING AGREEMENTS. OR TO ONLY TWO AGREEMENTS. FUTURE INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS. ALEX OF JURY ANSWERS I INTO CLOSE TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CLARK DR QUIRK. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER. THIS BILL DOES REFLECT. THE OBAMA ORDER. NO WITH THE OBAMA ORDER SAN ABOUT INTERCONNECTION FEES IS THERE WASN'T GOING TO BE ONE REGULATION. ON THE INTERCONNECTION FEES INSTEAD IT WOULD LOOK AT THE ISSUE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS BEING DONE HERE. SO ONE CAN IMAGINE [inaudible] FOR EXAMPLE. YOU HAVE THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER THAT'S DOING THE LAST MILE. YOU HAVE A MIDDLE MODEL PROVIDER THAT GOES FROM [inaudible] ST TAKE SOMETHING FROM THE FIRST MILE IN NEW YORK TO THE LAST MILE IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] SHOULD [inaudible] THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER. CHARGE THAT MIDDLE MINOR MIDDLE MILE PROVIDER. TO ME AT LEAST. THAT WOULD SEEM. TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS THING BECAUSE IT COULD SLOW DOWN THE INTERNET. ON THE OTHER HAND [inaudible] IF NETFLIX. WHERE TO DO SOME SORT OF DRAMATIC NETWORK OF ITS OWN AND THAT NEED A SPECIAL PIPE CONNECT TO THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER AND THEN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER HAD TO BUILD A SPECIAL PIE. THEN IN THAT CASE I BELIEVE YOU COULD CHARGE. THAT ALL WOULD BE DETERMINED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO'S IN CHARGE OF ENFORCEMENT SAID THIS BILL DOES HAVE FLEXIBILITY. DOES ALLOW FOR SOME CHARGES WHEN THEY ARE JUSTIFIED THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR QUIRK MISTER PATTERSON. A THANK YOU MEMBERS OF LET ME LET ME START FIRST OF ALL. OF ON WHAT REALLY IS I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AT THE HEART OF THIS. WHICH IS OUR THIS [inaudible] IT'S CLEARLY. A FEDERAL ISSUE. A JURISDICTION WHERE PREEMPTION IS GOING TO BE. A BIT THE DISCUSSION AND IT'S GOING TO END UP BEING. NOT LITIGATED IF THERE WAS EVER ANYTHING AS UBIQUITOUS AND INTERSTATE COMMERCE. AS THE INTERNET I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING. A GROUP MORE DIRECTED WITH RESPECT TO THAT EXAMPLE. THIS WILL IN FACT BE LITIGATED AND IT WILL BE LITIGATED UP. PRESUMABLY TO THE SUPREME COURT. AND Y. BECAUSE IT TRAMPLES FUNDAMENTALLY. ON THE KINDS OF SEPARATED POWERS AND ENUMERATED POWERS AND POWERS THAT HAVE BEEN THROUGH A COURTS AND AND AND JURISDICTIONS AND AND RULE MAKING. THE FACT IS THAT THE WORST POSSIBLE THING. THAT WE COULD DO [inaudible] IT'S BUT I HAVE CREATED STATE [inaudible] FCC'S. SO FIRST OF ALL. WHAT IS AN EFFORT HERE I THINK A? SO WHAT POLITICAL. AND I THINK DUBBED QUITE SHORT SIGHTED. WILL TRIP LITIGATION THAT I THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE. UNSUCCESSFUL [inaudible] IN DEFENDING. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS UNCERTAINTY? IN CALIFORNIA FOR AS LONG AS THE LITIGATION. PROCEEDS IT COULD VERY THEM HIGHLY PROBABLY. LEAD TO THE UP SUPREME COURT ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT IT CALIFORNIA THIS IS AN AREA THAT IS RESERVED. FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO I THINK THE BIGGER POINT HERE IS IF YOU ARE REALLY INTERESTED. I IN THAT NEUTRALITY UP THE PLACE TO HAVE THIS -- FLASHED OUT IS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WITH FEDERAL ELECTIONS IN FEDERAL ACCOUNTABILITY. WE ARE GOING TO I THINK IN MANY RESPECTS CHILL. ARE THE INTERNET IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE ABOUT LITIGATION AND THE UNCERTAINTY THAT IT CREATES. AND I KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME MEMBERS ARE GOING TO SUGGEST THAT -- WELL HOW CAN YOU. PRESUME WHAT A COURTS GOING TO DO IN THE UNCERTAIN IT'S AFTER. I'M ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS NOT HAD THIRTY YEARS OF BROADCAST EXPERIENCE OWNING AND OPERATING. BROADCAST PROPERTIES AND BEING REGULATED UNDER THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION. TEN YOU IMAGINE WHAT LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE. IF I WHAT WERE REGULATED BY EVERY -- THAT LOOKED OUT. WANNABE FCC THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE I COVER. REPEATEDLY AN AND OVER AGAIN. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WHEN THIS HAS BEEN TESTED. WHEN STE THE STATE'S OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE TRIED TO SAY TO A FEDERALLY REGULATED DUBBED? A A CARRIERS IN MY INSTANCE IN OVER THE AIR BROADCASTING IT TO HAVE BEEN HAS BEEN. UP SHUT DOWN. AND IT'S BEEN THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE CLAUSE AND ITS APPLICATION BATS. THAT'S COMING OUR WAY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO UNDER DISPUTE THE FACT THAT THIS IS JUST THAT THE OBAMA AIRONET NEUTRALITY. AND WE HAD A A VOTE ON THAT BILL IN. THE COMMITTEE THAT WAS PRECISELY THAT. AND FOR SOME REASON OF THAT DIDN'T COUNT THAT DID MATTER NOW WE'RE LOADING UP. A VERY SIGNIFICANT. A SET OF ADDITIONS. OF REGULATIONS AND AND HOOPS AND THANKS TO JUMP THROUGH. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO JUST TO CLAIM THAT THIS IS. OUR ONLY OBAMA ERA I THINK IS EXHIBITED HUGE EXAGGERATION. HAD IT BEN. THE OBAMACARE REGULATIONS. I WOULD HAVE BEEN GLADLY STANDING HERE. ASKING FOR YOU TO SUPPORT IT. BUT I CANNOT BECAUSE IT TAKES SEVERAL STEPS. WAY TOO FAR. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE SOMETHING THAT THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE AND TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN WHEN AND THE AND THE FACT IS THAT THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT. ARE -- EACH YEAR. ARE FROM ARE THE END OF THE RECESSION UNTIL TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS VERY ROBUST VERY STRONG. AND THE FACT IS THAT WHEN TO FIFTEEN ARRIVED AND THE LIGHT TOUCH ON THE INTERNET WAS REPLACED BY THE HEAVY TOUCH. THURMOND AND YET INTERNET CAPITAL INVESTMENT BROADBAND PROVIDERS DECLINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE END. OF THE RECESSION AND INVESTMENT LOW STEAM DOWN MORE THAN THREE OR 4% FROM TWENTY FOUR TO LOOK. THE BAD THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS. THAT THE LIGHT TOUCH INTERNET HAS EXPLODED AND THE FLOURISHED AND HAS HUGE COMPETITION AND GREAT BENEFIT FOR PEOPLE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND IN CALIFORNIA. THE OVER REACH THE GOING TOO FAR HERE IS GOING TO BE CHALLENGED IN COURT CONSTITUTIONALLY THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES IN VERY UNCERTAIN TERRITORY. WITH AN UNCERTAINTY AND A CHILLING. OFF THE INTERNET. WHAT HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL SO UBIQUITOUS AND SO IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA? I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A FRAUGHT WITH LITIGATION UNCERTAINTY AND THAT'S GOING TO MEAN THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE AN INTERNET THAT IS GLASS. I ROBUST LESS INVESTED IN THEM THAN WE'VE HAD BEFORE THAT'S WHAT HEAVY REGULATION DOES. TIMELY MIGHT REGULATION IS THE ANSWER BAD AND I'M GOING TO ASK THAT THAT YOU VOTE NO YOUR KILEY. THANK YOU SPEAKER. CLEAR THAT THERE IS OVERWHELMING SUPPORT IN THIS BODY AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF NET NEUTRALITY. THAT CONTENT ON THE INTERNET SHOULD BE NEITHER WALKED NORTH THROTTLED NOR TREATED IN A DISCRIMINATORY MANNER. BUT SUPPORTING THOSE PRINCIPLES DOES NOT MEAN SUPPORTING THIS PARTICULAR BILL. I DO NOT BELIEVE. THAT PASSING THIS BILL WILL RESULT IN NET NEUTRALITY IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEIR TWO MAIN REASONS WHY. THE FIRST REASON IS THAT WHEN LOOKING AT THE BEST DEFINITION OF NET NEUTRALITY THAT WE HAVE THE F. C. C.'S TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ORDER. THIS BILL DIVERGES FROM IT DOES NOT. RE ENACT THAT ORDER THIS WAS PROPOSED BY THE ASSEMBLY PRIVACY COMMITTEE. BUT THE BILL WENT IN ANOTHER DIRECTION. IMPOSING NEW UNPRECEDENTED RESTRICTIONS ON THE INTERNET THAT WERE NOT PART OF NET NEUTRALITY AS THE OBAMA ERA FCC. UNDERSTOOD IT. BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE MY WORD FOR THAT. IN COMMITTEE WE HEARD FROM THE ARCHITECT OF THIS BILL THE PROFESSOR WHO ALSO HAD A HAND IN THE FCC ORDER. AND SHE EXPLAINED TO US OUR VARIOUS POLICIES THAT ARE IN THIS BILL THAT WERE PROPOSED TO THE FCC BUT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FCC'S ORDER AS PART OF NET NEUTRALITY. AND THESE NEW UNPRECEDENTED RESTRICTIONS ON THE INTERNET PROVISIONS DEALING WITH NETWORK MANAGEMENT ZERO RATING INTERCONNECTION SPECIALIZED SERVICES. NOT ONLY ARE EXTRANEOUS TO NET NEUTRALITY BUT ACTIVELY WORK AGAINST ITS GOAL OF A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET FOR ALL. BY RAISING COSTS PARTICULARLY BURDENING THE POOR BY REDUCING ACT REDUCING ACCESS ESPECIALLY FOR RURAL AREAS BY LIMITING CHOICES BY THROTTLING THE BREATHTAKING INNOVATION THAT HAS BEEN A HALLMARK. OF THE INFORMATION AGE. BUT THE SECOND REASON THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT RESULT IN NET NEUTRALITY IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT IT IS PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW NOW THIS TERM FEDERAL PREEMPTION I KNOW IT SOUNDS LEGALISTIC. BUT IT'S AT THE HEART OF AMERICAN FRIENDLY FEDERALISM. JUST AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT INFRINGE UPON OUR SPEAR OF LAWMAKING AS A STATE SO TO WE AS A STATE. CANNOT LEGISLATE IN A WAY THAT CONFLICTS FEDERAL LAW AND HERE THE PREEMPTION CASE IS REALLY CLEAR. THE RELEVANT FEDERAL LAW THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FCC ORDER THAT'S THE ONE NET NEUTRALITY SUPPORTERS DON'T LIKE. HAS A PROVISION IN PARAGRAPH. ONE NINETY FOUR THAT EXPRESSLY PREAMPS STATE AND LOCAL LAW MAKING ON THE MATTER. BUT YOU MIGHT SAY WAIT A MINUTE IS NOT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FCC ORDER ITSELF BEING CHALLENGED IN COURT RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S TRUE IT IS. BUT EVEN OF THAT ORDER. WERE SOMEHOW INVALIDATED THERE STILL A PROBLEM AND THAT'S OF THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FCC ORDER THE ONE THAT NET NEUTRALITY SUPPORTERS LIKE. ALSO PREEMPTED STATE AND LOCAL LAW MAKING WITH PERMISSION TO READ MISTER SPEAKER [inaudible] WITHOUT OBJECTION. PARAGRAPH FOUR THIRTY THREE OF THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ORDER STATES THE COMMISSION IS USE PREEMPTION TO PROTECT FEDERAL INTEREST WHEN A STATE REGULATION CONFLICTS WITH FEDERAL RULES OR POLICIES. AND WE INTEND TO EXERCISE THIS AUTHORITY TO PREEMPT ANY STATE REGULATIONS OF A CONFLICT WHICH CONFLICT WITH THIS COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY SCHEME. OR OTHER FEDERAL LAW SO THE PREEMPTION CASE IS REALLY CLEAR AND AGAIN YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR THAT. THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION ONE OF THE NATION'S LEADING PROPONENTS OF NET NEUTRALITY AND SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL. HAS SAID THERE'S A 10% CHANCE THAT THE STATE'S DIRECT REGULATION OF ISPS ON NET NEUTRALITY WILL SURVIVE A LEGAL CHALLENGE [inaudible] 10%. AND OF COURSE ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S A 1100% CHANCE. PASSING THIS BILL WILL CREATE PROTRACTED REGULAR OUT LITIGATION AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY THE PRICE OF WHICH WILL BE BORNE BY CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. I WANTED TO PUT OUT CLOTHES JUST WITH WORD ABOUT THE PUBLIC INTEREST THIS BILL IS GENERATED BECAUSE I'VE MET WITH A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE THE BILL AND IT'S BEEN GREAT TO SEE IT'S CLEAR THAT PEOPLE FEEL. A POWERFUL STAKE IN THIS ISSUE AND THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNET AND RIGHTLY SO. FEW TECHNOLOGIES IN HUMAN HISTORY HAVE PRODUCED SUCH A PERVASIVE AND SWEEPING SOCIAL CHANGE SO QUICKLY HAVE BECOME SO DEEPLY INTEGRATED INTO ALL DIMENSIONS OF OUR PERSONAL. AND PROFESSIONAL LIVES THIRTY SECOND AND THE INTERNET IS NOT THE PROPERTY OF ANY ONE PERSON OR COUNTRY OR COMPANY BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BUILT TOGETHER AND BELONGS TO ALL OF US. WHICH IS WHY IT'S BEEN AYE SO GREAT TO SEE THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC INTEREST IN THIS DEBATE. BUT IT'S ALSO WHY I BELIEVE THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL MISMATCH BETWEEN THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE AND THE POLICY IMPACT OF THIS BILL. IF YOU BELIEVE IN THAT ITS ROWDY THIS IS NOT THE BILL FOR YOU IT WILL INITIALLY DO MUCH MORE AND WILL EVENTUALLY DO NOTHING AT ANK YOU MISTER KILEY MISTER KALRA YOUR READINESS. THANK YOU MISS SPEAKER MEMBERS OF I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT TWENTY TWO AND I THINK THE AUTHOR WHO SAN FRANCISCO IN OUR COLLEAGUE. OF HER BRING THIS FORWARD -- THIS AFTERNOON. AND THE TO OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE -- THAT AT THE PARTY OF STATES RIGHTS I GUESS YOU SHOULD GET TO CHOOSE WHEN YOU WON THE WAY THAT BETTER WHEN YOU DON'T. BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR CONSUMERS WHEN IT COMES TO CALIFORNIA'S WE SHOULD NEVER ABDICATE OUR RESPONSIBILITY. TO FIGHT FOR CALIFORNIA'S INTO BITE FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN WHAT THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE AN INTEREST AND IN PROTECTING CONSUMERS. WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST YEAR TO HAVE A THE ROLLING BACK OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. OF IN WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES NOT JUST ON THIS ISSUE IN BANKING. AND HEALTH CARE. IMMIGRATION RIGHTS YOU NAME IT THEY'RE ROLLING BACK PUT. AND IT'S UP TO US TO STAND UP AGAINST THEM DOING THAT AND WE'VE BEEN DOING SO IN OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS BEEN DOING SO AND RIGHTFULLY SO NOW. IN MY COUNTY SANTA CLARA COUNTY AYE DURING THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX FIRE. UP TO JUST LIKE MANY OTHER COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE. THEY SENT FIREFIGHTERS OUT THERE TO HELP WITH MUTUAL AID. WHEN THEY DID THAT? A WIRELESS COMPANY LIMITED. SOCCER COUNTIES FIRE DEPARTMENTS DID ACCESS BY TONGLING THEIR SERVICE IN THE MIDST OF A WILD WILDFIRE. THE COMPANY ADMITTED. BUT THEY DID THAT. AND ACCORDING TO THE COUNTY FIRE CHIEF. ANTHONY BODEN THE DATA SERVICE PROVIDER FAILED TO LIVE UP TO THEIR POLICY OF THE TEAM DID A CAPS IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. WHEN THE DEPARTMENT ASKED FOR HELP WHETHER A BATTLING THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX FIRE NOW. DURING THE FIRE ONE VEHICLE IN PARTICULAR WAS AFFECTED ONLY US BY. TWO SIX TWO PAST THE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYER THOUGH THE VEHICLE DEPLOYED BY THE DEPARTMENT TO TRACK ORGANIZE AND PRIORITIZE ROUTING OF RESOURCES FROM AROUND THE STATE AND COUNTRY. TO THE SITE. THE SITES WHERE THEY ARE MOST NEEDED DURING THE BLAZE. THE DEPARTMENT'S PLAN CALLED FOR THEIR DATA SPEEDS TO BE SLOWED IF THEY USE MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE GIGABYTES A MONTH. IN THE MIDST OF THE RESPONSE THE COUNTY FIRE DISCOVERED THE DATA CONNECTION BUT THIS RIG WAS BEING THROTTLED BY THE COMPANY AND DATA RATES HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO ONE TO HUNDREDS. OR LESS THAN THE PREVIOUS SPEEDS. NOW WHEN THE DEPARTMENT ASKED THE COMPANY. TO LIFT THIS RESTRICTION THEY REJECTED IT. AND THEY SAID THEY'D HAVE TO BUY A NEW DATA PLAN WHICH COST TWICE AS MUCH IN THE MIDDLE. OF THIS FIRE [inaudible] SO. WE TALK ABOUT NET NEUTRALITY A WHAT IT REALLY MEANS IN TERMS OF SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT INTERNET ACCESS WHICH BY ITSELF. IS ABOUT ENOUGH ARGUMENT FOR NET NEUTRALITY. BUT THIS IS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY IS OUR LOVING THAT'LL THAT'LL PLAY BILL FOR A CONSUMERS. BUT THAT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY. AND OTHERS THAT RELY. ON THE INTERNET. DON'T FIND THEMSELVES IN THE SITUATION THAT ARE COUNTY FIREFIGHTERS FOUND THEMSELVES IN. DURING THE BIGGEST WILDFIRE IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. UP THE PERMISSION TO READ. WITHOUT OBJECTION THANK YOU. COUNSEL FOR THE COUNTY STATED THE THIS COMPANIES THROTTLING HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THAT NEUTRALITY IS SHOWS THAT THE ISPS WILL ACT IN THEIR ECONOMIC INTERESTS EVEN AT THE EXPENSE. A PUBLIC SAFETY. SO I URGE NOT ONLY ONE THE COMES TO SAVE YOU AND NOT JUST FOR CONSUMER EQUITY. BUT BEING FROM SILICON VALLEY. IN TERMS OF ENSURING NOT ONLY THAT WE DON'T JUST THROTTLE CONSUMER ACCESS BUT WE DON'T THROTTLE SILICON VALLEY INNOVATION. I URGE YOU ABOUT AYE ON THIS BILL [inaudible] SURE LEVINE [inaudible] YOU'RE RECOMMENDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF NET NEUTRALITY AND I STAND IN SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. THIS BILL THIS ISSUE IS EXACTLY WHERE. PUBLIC POLICY AND PUBLIC INTEREST COLLIDE AND CAN ALIGN WITH ONE ANOTHER THIS IS AN ERA WHERE WE MUST NOT. DISCRIMINATE AGAINST CONTENT THIS IS AN ERA WHERE WE ACTUALLY NEED TO HAVE MORE CONTENT WHERE IF WE WANT TO LEARN ABOUT THE SOCIETY THAT WE LIVE IN WE MUST READ. AND HEAR FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES TO DISCERN WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING AROUND US AND TO SOCIETY. AND WE SEE TRENDS THAT ARE TROUBLING OF COURSE WE'VE SEEN SINCE PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK OFFICE THIS CHANGE I WITH THE REVERSAL OF NET NEUTRALITY. WE ALSO HEARD JUST THIS PAST WEEK ABOUT HOW UPSET HE WAS BECAUSE WHEN HE DID A SEARCH ABOUT HIMSELF. HE DIDN'T LIKE THE CONTENT. THAT CAME BACK IN HIS SEARCHES. WE ALSO KNOW. THAT FOX NEWS HAS THIS ESSENTIALLY BECOME STATE RUN MEDIA. WERE ONLY CONTENT THE PRESIDENT LIKES IS BEING DELIVERED. TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. WE ALSO KNOW THAT FACEBOOK WHICH HAS BEEN SO IRRESPONSIBLE. DURING THIS MOMENT IN TIME. IS NOW IN PARTNERSHIP WITH VOX PRODUCING MORE CONTENT TO BE ON ITS PLATFORM. WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT ALL CONTENT IS EQUAL ON THE INTERNET SET THIS CONTENT IS NOT BE ALL THAT ONLY MEETS THE PRESIDENT'S STANDARDS I IS NOT THE ONLY CONTENT TO POINT THAT PEOPLE RECEIVE. I WOULD I WOULD ASK THE MEMBER WOULD STICK TO THE FACTS HE'S TRYING TO EDITORIALIZE TRYING TO SAY THAT FOX NEWS IS AN OUTLET OF ON THE STATE RUN MEDIA OR THE GOVERNMENT. THIS IS THE SAME THING AS SAYING THAT MSNBC AND CNN IS THE IS THE TOOL OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. OR THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION THIS IS YOU KNOW CAN YOU PLEASE KEEP IT TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL. AND NOT EDITORIAL COMMENT. MISTER ALAN POINT ORDERS NOW WILL TAKE A MISTER LEVINE IS SPEAKING TO CONTENT AND CONTENT DISTRIBUTION I BELIEVE IT'S RELEVANT TO THE BILL BEFORE THE BODY MITCHELL BEING TO MAKE CONTINUE. THANK YOU I THINK THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SOMEWHERE INLAND FROM HUNTINGTON BEACH MADE MY POINT FOR ME I STAND IN SUPPORT OF A S. B.. EIGHT TWENTY TWO SHE BONTA DIRECTLY.

THAT YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING IN THIS IS A FEDERAL ISSUE THE ARROGANCE ON THIS PLAN THIS ISSUE IS COMICAL AT THIS POINT I MEAN. I WOULD ARGUE THAT IF WE WE ASKED FIVE PEOPLE IN HERE WHO ARE ARGUING FOR THIS BILL YOU COULDN'T EXPLAIN NET NEUTRALITY IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT THE LINE. THIS IS NOT OUR ISSUE I GET IT. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MADE A CHANGE AND IN CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATS WHO YOU YOU RESIST CHANGE WHEN IT COMES TO THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION THAT'S FINE [inaudible] BUT DON'T PUT INTERNET CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA AT RISK DON'T DISRUPT THEIR LIVES AND THEIR INTERNET CONNECTION THEIR SERVICE DON'T INTERRUPT THAT SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE A POLITICAL POINT THIS IS EMBARRASSING. PLEASE VOTE NOW [inaudible] MISTER ALAN. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. NET NEUTRALITY IS NOT ABOUT A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET. NET NEUTRALITY IS ABOUT GOVERNMENT CENSORSHIP AND REGULATION. OF THE INTERNET. WHAT NAY NEUTRALITY REALLY IS IS NET NEUTRALITY? IS A VERY SIMPLE PLAN. TO MAKE THE INTERNET. A TITLE TO COMMON CARRIER. THIS WOULD MAKE. THE INTERNET SUBJECT TO SAME RULES. THERE ARE PHONE COMPANIES SUBJECT. TO THE PROPONENTS OF NET NEUTRALITY LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS IS ABOUT. HAVING NO PAID PRIORITIZATION. ON THE INTERNET. BUT THINK ABOUT THIS LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR OUR POST OFFICE. ANOTHER COMMON CARRIER. WE YOU MAIL LETTER YOU CAN MAIL IT FIRST CLASS. YOU CAN ALSO MILLER PRIORITY YOU CAN EVEN MAIL IT. NEXT DAY [inaudible] PAID PRIORITIZATION. WITHOUT PAID PRIORITIZATION. ON THE INTERNET. THIS MEANS THAT YOUR AT HOME. BUT YOU CAN'T WATCH YOUR NETFLIX MOVIE. BECAUSE YOUR NEIGHBOR DOWN THE ROAD IS DOWNLOADING EIGHT PORN MOVIES. SO WHY SHOULD YOU HAVE TO PAY IN SPEED. FOR THE BEHAVIOR. OF YOUR NEIGHBORS. VERY SIMPLY THE MARKET HAS ALREADY WORKED OUT A MECHANISM. THE BOOK DEMAND THAT THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT SOMEHOW. SOMEONE IS TRYING TO REGULATE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ON THE INTERNET AND IF ONLY YOU ENACT NET NEUTRALITY. YOU KNOW WILL BE PROTECTED. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS VERY SIMPLE. YOU'RE ALREADY PROTECTED TODAY. THERE IS ANTI TRUST AND THEIR ANTI TRUST LAWS. PROTECT YOU AGAINST THIS. THE VERY CIVIL MARKET MECHANISM OF LEADER IN ITSELF PROTECTS YOU. SIMPLY PUT NET NEUTRALITY IS GOVERNMENT CENSORSHIP. AND IT IS REGULATION OF THE INTERNET. NEVER MANY PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED AS TO WHAT THE ULTIMATE ROOT. OF WHY THE DEMOCRATS. WANT NET NEUTRALITY AND WHY THEY WANT TO REGULATE THE INTERNET. AND POTENTIALLY EVEN CENSOR WHAT WE SEE ON YOUR HEAD IT'S FACTUALLY VERY SIMPLE. BECAUSE BACK TO NINETEEN FORTY NINE IN NINETEEN FORTY NINE THE SEC CAME UP WITH SOME THE CALL THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE. AND IT SOUNDED REALLY GOOD I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS. IT REQUIRED BROADCASTERS TO PRESENT CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES IN A MANNER THAT WAS HONEST. EQUITABLE AND BALLOTS. KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE FOX NEWS. THE PROBLEM IS. IS THAT BY. NINETEEN SIXTY SIX THE DEMOCRATS HAD FIGURED OUT THAT THIS IS A TOOL THAT THEY CAN USE. AND I WILL QUOTE. BILL RUDER FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF COMMERCE. UNDER PRESIDENT KENNEDY. WHO SAID THE FOLLOWING? OUR MASSIVE STRATEGY WAS TO USE THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE TO CHALLENGE AND HARASS RIGHT WING BROADCASTERS AND HOPE THAT THE CHALLENGES WOULD BE SO COSTLY TO THEM THAT THEY WOULD BE INHIBITED. AND DECIDED IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE TO CONTINUE [inaudible] VERY SIMPLY. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS A LONG HISTORY OF USING SO CALLED FAIRNESS. AND RULES EXACTLY LIKE NET NEUTRALITY TO SILENCE SPEECH WITH WHICH THEY DISAGREE VIOLATING OUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. BILL CLINTON EVEN RECOGNIZES IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX HE AMENDED. THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR AND HE SAID. THAT THE INTERNET SHOULD BE UNFETTERED FROM FEDERAL OR STATE REGULATION. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN NET NEUTRALITY IS VERY SIMPLE THIS IS NOT ABOUT BEING A FEDERAL ISSUE OUR STATE ISSUES GOT NONE OF THAT. WHAT NET NEUTRALITY TRULY IS IS AN EFFORT? A CONCENTRATED EFFORT. TO REGULATE YOUR INTERNET. TREAT THE INTERNET LIKE A TITLE TO COMMON CARRIER AND SAID YOU THE SAME RULES THAT WE PUT UNDER TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES. TREAT THE INTERNET LIKE A STODGY UTILITY AND NOT THE VIBRANT DIVERSE. TOOL THAT WE ALL USE. NET NEUTRALITY IS ABOUT IDEA NET NEUTRALITY WILL LEAD TO HIGHER COST YOU LEAD TO SLOWER CONNECTIONS. NET NEUTRALITY WILL LEAD TO LESS CONTENT AND LESS DIVERSE VIEWS ON THE INTERNET. NET NEUTRALITY IS A VIOLATION OF YOUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. BUT BEYOND ALL THAT. IT'S JUST A BAD IDEA. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF TRYING TO REGULATE WHAT WE HEAR WHAT WE SEE AND WHAT WE BELIEVE. THERE'S NO FAKE NEWS OF THIS THE RECORD'S CLEAR NET NEUTRALITY IS THE NEXT VERSION OF THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE. THIRTY CELULARES ROUND SOLVE THIS WAS A BAD IDEA. AS DID RONALD REAGAN. LET'S KEEP THE INTERNET. UNFETTERED FROM FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATION. LET'S GET READY NET NEUTRALITY LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL HAVE FASTER NET CONNECTIONS AND THE MARKET WILL ACTUALLY SORT THIS OUT. WE DON'T NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO SAVE US VOTE NO ON NET NEUTRALITY. THANK YOU MISTER AL. CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED MAKE YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AS IT I AGREE I AGREE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE THE BODY THE HOUSE TO MAKE THE DECISION WHEN IT COMES TO THESE TYPES OF ISSUES. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELY ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TO PROTECT US SOMETHING THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY REGARDLESS OF YOUR PARTY WHERE YOU'RE DEMOCRAT IN A PEN REPUBLICAN. OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTS IS A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELY ON OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO NOT ROLL BACK THOSE TYPES OF PROTECTIONS THAT PROTECT US AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT IS OUR JOB OUR JOB. AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE'RE NOT JUST THE REST OF THE NATION LOOKS TO SEE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO ESPECIALLY ON ISSUES OF TECHNOLOGY. BECAUSE WERE LEADER BUT THEN ALSO INTERNATIONALLY TO STEP UP AND PROPOSE SOMETHING TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY EXPECT OF US. THAT IS OUR JOB AND SO THAT IS WHAT WOULD. FILLING THE ROLE THAT WE NEED TO FILL BECAUSE WE CANNOT RELY ON THIS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT US WHEN WE NEED PROTECTION AND I'M SORRY. YOU ONLY NEED TO LOOK AT ONE THING TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU NEED TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL OUR FIREFIGHTERS TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US. REGARDLESS OF PARTY SPEAK SO GLARINGLY OUT. EVERY SINGLE TIME. THEY'RE BATTLING ARE WILD FIRES. AND THE ONE THING THAT THESE COMPANIES CONTINUE TO SAY IS WE DON'T BLOCK WE DON'T THROTTLE WE DON'T DO THESE THINGS. WE DON'T DO IT IT'S A NON ISSUE WOULD NOT EXIST IN. AND THEN THEY DO IT. TALK ABOUT THE DUMBEST THING THEY COULD HAVE POSSIBLY DONE TO CONVINCE US. THAT THEIR LION. THEY CLEARLY DO IT IT'S AN ISSUE THAT HIT THE FIREFIGHTERS THAT ARE FIGHTING TO PROTECT OUR CONSTITUENTS HOMES FIGHTING TO PROTECT OUR CONSTITUENTS LIVES SO I'M SORRY. I'M SO I'M SORRY THAT THEY'RE UPSET BUT THEY CREATED THIS ISSUE FOR THEMSELVES HAD THEY NOT WORK FOR YEARS TO GET RID OF NET NEUTRALITY ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE WOULDN'T BE HERE DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE RIGHT NOW. IT'S A PROBLEM THAT THEY CREATED ON THE AROUND NOW WE'RE STEPPING UP AND WE'RE DOING OUR JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS AND THE PEOPLE THAT RELY ON US TO DO OUR JOB. KNOW THAT WE'RE PROTECTING THEM AND WE'RE DOING WHAT'S RIGHT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. NAMES CALDERON MISTER DALLI. THERE YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I'D JUST LIKE. FOR THIS BODY TO JUST GET INTERNET TO HALF OF MY DISTRICT AND THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN REGULATE IT. THANK YOU MISTER DALLI MISS GALLAGHER HERE RECOGNIZE. THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER A PHONE ON MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER -- A VERY GOOD POINT BECAUSE THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH THIS BILL. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT BROADBAND EXPANSION WHICH MANY OF US HAVE FOUGHT. FOR TWO IN TO BRING MORE INTERNET SERVICE TO RURAL AREAS AND AND TO UNDERSERVED PARTS OF THE STATE. SO THAT'S A VERY REAL ISSUE -- ALSO ELIMINATING ZERO RATING. IS GOING TO ELIMINATE. SAVINGS TO CONSUMERS INCLUDING MANY OF THE LOW INCOME FOLKS IN THE STATE. WHO AS WAS POINTED OUT BY MY COLLEAGUE? UTILIZE THEIR PHONES MUCH MORE TO GET OUT TO GET OUT THIS VITAL DATA INFORMATION SO. EVEN SOME OF THE POINTS THAT ARE BEING BROUGHT UP AS REASONS TO VOTE FOR THIS DOESN'T ACTUALLY HELP IT ACTUALLY HURTS CONSUMERS. THESE REGULATIONS BUT LET'S GET BACK TO BECAUSE WE START OFF THIS DEBATE BY. WHY WE'RE ALL HERE? AND THE REAL REASON THAT WE'RE ALL HERE. IS SO THAT. YOU GUYS CAN LIKE OUT DEBATE EACH OTHER TRYING TO PLACATE YOUR BASE. OVER A BOOGEYMAN ISSUE OF NET NEUTRALITY WE ALL AGREE ON THE PRINCIPLES OF NET NEUTRALITY. YOU ARE MY COLLEAGUE FROM IRAN YOU KNOW WHO'S KIND OF KNOWN FOR HIS. HYPERBOLE AN EMBELLISHMENT -- YOU DID A REALLY GOOD JELLY POLY GET ANOTHER TWO POINTS OVER 70%. IN HIS HOME DISTRICT -- VIA ó EIGHTY SORRY YOU KNOW SO HEY LOOK HE'S HE'S GONNA. JACK OF THE POINTS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS REALLY ALL ABOUT IS TRYING TO PLACATE. THAT MASON SHOW HOW HARD YOU'RE FIGHTING AGAINST TRUMP WINNER REALITY NONE OF THE STUFF IS REALLY HAPPENING HAVE APPOINTED ANY EVIDENCE. OF THIS REALLY HAPPENING -- AND OF PEOPLE SLOWING DOWN PURPOSELY PEOPLE'S DATA. THAT HASN'T THAT HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITS OCCURRED HERE THE THE ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP ACTUALLY HELD A SELECT COMMITTEE ON THIS. AND ACTUALLY EXPLAIN WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE X. THEY HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR DATA PLAN. AND THE PEOPLE CALLED WAS A HUMAN ERROR ISSUE. ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY IT WAS OF THE COMPANY ITSELF PURPOSEFULLY SLOWING DOWN PEOPLE'S DATA. AND AND AND IN FACT THE COMPANY CAME BACK AND SAID NOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES IN THE STATE THAT THEY DO HAVE THAT. UNLIMITED DATA SO THAT THEY DON'T RUN INTO THAT PROBLEM AGAIN. SO. YOU EVEN THE ESSENCE OF THE PEOPLE ARE POINT AND OH BY THE WAY THE POLICY YOU'RE PASSING TODAY WOULD DO NOTHING ABOUT THAT SITUATION. BY THE WAY LET'S TELL THE TRUTH. THE POLICY OR PASSIVE THEY WOULD DO NOTHING ABOUT THAT SITUATION PERIOD. SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY HEAR ABOUT IS. AGAIN TRYING TO PLACATE. TO THE LEFT BASS. ENJOY YOUR OUT DO EACH OTHER IN FACT THIS BILL WAS KILLED -- WAS STOPPED IN A COMMITTEE. AND THAT BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER POINT OF WHY WE'RE HERE YBER BULLYING. MAYBE WE SHOULD START TAKING THAT UP THAT ISSUE BECAUSE WHAT I'VE SEEN MORE SO. IS PEOPLE. BOWING DOWN TO THE BOWLING THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING ONLINE. AND FORCING PEOPLE TO PASS A BAD POLICY THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH FEDERALISM. MSGOING TO CREATE A PATCHWORK OF THINGS ACTUALLY GONNA SLOW DOWN PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO GET GOOD DATA AND I FIND IT SO INTERESTING. THEY WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO ALL POINTS OF VIEW AND CONTENT. THE DATA WE DON'T WANT TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST CONTENT. WHEN THIS BODY IS THE ONE THAT SAY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GET IN THE BUSINESS OF TELLING YOU WHAT IS FAKE NEWS AND WHAT'S NOT? JUST YESTERDAY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT THE REAL THREAT. TO FREE SPEECH THE REAL THREAT WHEN IT COMES TO CENSORSHIP IS THIS BODY RIGHT HERE. THAT IS NOT I S. PIECE IT'S ACTUALLY GROUPS LIKE YOU. TO AND FACEBOOK AND TWITTER. WHO HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN ACTUALLY DO THIS? ACTUALLY DISCRIMINATE BASED ON CONTENT ACTUALLY SAY THAT WE DON'T YOU ACTUALLY SLOW DOWN ACTUALLY BLOCK [inaudible] CONTENT. FROM VIEW POINTS THAT THEY DON'T AGREE WITH. NOT THE HIGHEST PEAS. BUT I'LL SEE YOU GUYS STAND UP AND DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. BUT HEY IT'S JUST ANOTHER DAY HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. MAYBE THIS BILL ONLY GET TO THIRTY NINE BUT DOESN'T MATTER WILL BULLY OUR WAY TO FORTY ONE RIGHT. ALL DEBATE AND DISCUSSION HAVING CEASED. MISTER SANTIAGO YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE A ROBUST DEBATE -- BUT THERE'S A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOME OF OUR FRIENDS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE AISLE -- IN TERMS OF THE ISSUE OF NET NEUTRALITY BUT I'M STILL HOPEFUL THAT THEY'LL BE PIE PARTISAN SUPPORT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. I THINK TRULY THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN OPEN. AND FREE INTERNET. I HEAR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS REALLY A QUESTION OF VALUES. STATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. DO YOU BELIEVE IN NET NEUTRALITY. DO YOU BELIEVE. AND A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET. AND IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE BECAUSE IF YOU DO. YOU PRESS THE GREEN BUTTON THAT MEANS YES. AND IF YOU DON'T. YOU PRESS THE RED. ONE OR SOMETHING IN BETWEEN. NOW THE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME HERE TALKING ABOUT JURISDICTION. AND WHETHER IT'S A FEDERAL ISSUE. OR A STATE ISSUE. AND THEN MAYBE FIST PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT ON THAT BUT I WILL REMIND YOU. THAT IN THIS CHAMBER. WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF STANCES. THAT REFLECT OUR VALUES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WHEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. I TAX IMMIGRANTS [inaudible] HERE. INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA PROTECT THEM. AND WE FOUGHT BACK. STATE YOUR POINT OF ORDER SHALL -- SPEAKER JUST SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT ATTACKS IMMIGRANTS THAT'S ACTUALLY A FALSE CLAIM. AND I WOULD ASK HIM TO YOU ARE YOU KNOW REFRAIN FOR MAKING FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT THE PRESENT I'D STATES [inaudible] MISTER ALAN. POINT OF ORDER IS NOT WELL TAKEN THAT THE JOCKEY ON THE BILL IS REFERRING TO THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES I WOULD HAVE. THE AUTHOR THE JOCKEY HOWEVER. REFRAIN FROM ANY DISCUSSION BEYOND THE MERITS OF THE BILL. WE'VE HAD A ROBUST DEBATE ON THE MATTER. LET'S CLOSE THIS OUT AND TAKE A VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE QUESTION BEFORE US.

TWELVE FIFTEEN AUTHORIZES THE REGIONAL WATER BOARDS TO REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION WORKS TENSION OF WASTEWATER SERVICES TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES MANY OF WHICH RELY ON AN ADEQUATE ONSITE SEWAGE TREATMENT SYSTEMS. IT REQUIRES A STATE WATER BOARD TO COVER THE COSTS OF COMPLETING THE EXTENSION OF SERVICES TO THE RECEIVING SEWER SYSTEM UPON FUNDING FROM THE LEGISLATURE.

SENATE BILL THIRTEEN HUNDRED BY SENATOR JACKSON ANOTHER WAS AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT. IT'S FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. AS WE'VE ALL LEARNED ADDRESSING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS NOT JUST ABOUT HOLDING PERPETRATORS ACCOUNTABLE ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THAT'S CRITICAL. IT'S ALSO VITAL THAT WE ENSURE THAT OUR LAWS ON OUR WORKPLACES PROTECT VICTIMS ALLOW THEM TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT HARASSMENT AND SEEK JUSTICE FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT COURTS. S. B. THIRTEEN HUNDRED IS THE RESULT OF A NUMBER OF THOUGHTFUL HEARINGS HELD BY THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON WOMEN WORK AND FAMILIES EARLIER THIS YEAR. AND SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN PROTECTIONS FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT VICTIMS IN A NUMBER OF KEY AREAS. FIRST SB THIRTEEN HUNDRED PROVIDES GUIDANCE A THE COURTS ON THE SEVERE AND PERVASIVE LEGAL STANDARD. WHICH IS VERY VAGUE RIGHT NOW UNDER THE LAW. THE BILL PRESERVES THE SEVERE AND PERVASIVE LEGALSTANDARD FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN PLACE AND IT'S A HIGH BAR. TO REACH THAT IT PROVIDES KEY GUIDANCE OF THE COURTS TO ENSURE THAT THE STANDARD IS CONSISTENTLY AND FAIRLY APPLIED. REGARDLESS OF WHERE AN EMPLOYEE WORKS OR HOW PRODUCTIVE THEY'VE BEEN AT WORK FOLLOWING A COLLEAGUES HARASSMENT. SECOND S. B. THIRTEEN HUNDRED CLOSES LEGAL LOOPHOLES BY PROHIBITING NON DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENT OR WHAT'S COMMONLY KNOWN AS SNEAKY RELEASES. THE BILL PROHIBITS EMPLOYERS FROM REQUIRING WORKERS TO SIGN AWAY THEIR ABILITY TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT HARASSMENT OR ABUSE OR THE RIGHT TO FILE A CLAIM AGAINST AN EMPLOYER. AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT OR CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OR FOUR WAGER BONUS THIS IS NOT THE SECRET SETTLEMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT SETTLEMENTS AFTER CLAIMS FILED. THIS IS ABOUT EMPLOYERS WHO SAY IF YOU WANT A BONUS OR YOU WANT A PROMOTION OR YOU WANT TO WAGE YOU HAVE TO IN ADVANCE SIGN AWAY YOUR RIGHTS TO ANY FUTURE LAWSUIT. THIRD AB THIRTEEN HUNDRED ALLOWS BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE BYSTANDER INTERVENING TRAINING AS PART OF THEIR REGULAR SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE I'VE HEARD SOME ON THIS UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BYSTANDER TRAINING IS NOT TRAINING PEOPLE THAT ARE OUTSIDE YOUR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE AS AN EMPLOYER. OF COURSE THAT WOULD BE RID OF RIDICULOUS STANDARD BUT RATHER HOW TO TRAIN YOUR OWN EMPLOYEES HOW TO INTERVENE IF THEY WITNESS SEXUAL HARASSMENT FROM ONE OF THEIR COLLEAGUES. RECENT AMENDMENTS HAVE REMOVED THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE'S JOB KILLER LABEL FROM THE BILL. THE BILL COLLECTIVELY SEEKS TO PROVIDE MANY OF THE PROTECTIONS FOR VICTIMS OF MOST OF US EXPECT AS A MATTER OF COURSE TOMORROW LAWS. AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISREAD IN THIS RACE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN HUNDRED JACKSONVILLE. MEMBERS WE'VE SEEN MANY MEASURES ON THIS FLOOR INCLUDING TWO OF MY OWN THAT ARE IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED. DURING THE ME TOO MOVEMENT HEARINGS. THESE ACTIONS ARE CRITICAL IN ORDER TO RESTORE TRUST OF THE PUBLIC. AND DO WHAT WE MUST TO PROTECT FOR POTENTIAL VICTIMS. ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL PROBLEMS WE FACE IS THE ISSUE WITH NON DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. IT'S CAN UNDERCUT VICTIMS. S. B. THIRTEEN HUNDRED PROHIBITS AN EMPLOYER FROM USING A RAZOR BONUSES AND INCENTIVE. OR CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT AS A CONDITION FOR HAVING AN INDIVIDUAL SIGN THESE AGREEMENTS. WE WILL NEVER HAVE WORKPLACE IS FREE FROM HARASSMENT WHEN WE GIVE HER ANSWERS A PERMISSION SLIP. TO BEHAVE BADLY. THIS BILL IS REASONABLE. IT DOES NOT APPLY TO SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS IT ALSO DOES NOT APPLY TO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT ARE MUTUALLY NEGOTIATED. IT'S PUT AN END TO THE TACTICS THAT ENABLE HARASSERS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B. OR SP [inaudible] THIRTEEN HUNDRED FAMOUS RACE. SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

THE STATISTICS FAR OUTPACED THE STATE'S POPULATION GROWTH OF 8% AS WELL AS INCREASE OF LICENSED DRIVERS ARE REGISTERED VEHICLES OF 11%. THE DECLINING SAFETY OF OUR HIGHWAYS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS FACT. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN THE NUMBER OF CHP OFFICERS ON OUR ROADS HAVE ACTUALLY DECREASED 7%.

ASSEMBLY TYPE RESOLUTION FIFTY BY SONY MEMBER REYES AND OTHERS RELATIVE TO VEHICULAR AIR POLLUTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. FOR OVER FIVE DECADES CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE NATION WITH EFFORTS COMBATING AUTOMOTIVE EMISSIONS VIA BIPARTISAN EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS THAT SERVE AS A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE NATION. AND THE WORLD. RECENTLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELEASED A PLAN. THAT WOULD ROLL BACK CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO SET ITS OWN AUTOMOTIVE EMISSIONS RULES. AS PROVIDED VIA WAIVER UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT. THIS NEW PLAN WILL INCREASE POLLUTION AND HAVE A DRASTIC IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY WITH THE INCREASED COSTS. AT THE FUEL PUMP. FOR CALIFORNIA DRIVERS. AND THE WILL ALSO CAUSE GREATER HEALTH CARE COSTS. CALIFORNIA'S AUTOMOTIVE POLLUTION STANDARDS HAVE PUSHED AND EXHILARATED INNOVATION IN THE AUTUMN OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY. OUR MODERN CARS PRODUCED FEWER EMISSIONS AND HAVE INCREASED GAS MILEAGE WITHOUT COMPROMISING PERFORMANCE. SUPPORTING AJ ARE FIFTY IS A VOTE FOR SCIENCE AND CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES TO PROTECT OUR AIR WITHOUT COMPROMISING CONSUMER CHOICE. I ASKED TO JOIN WITH ME TODAY TO REJECT THIS POORLY THOUGHT OUT POLICY BEING PROPOSED IN WASHINGTON DC. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I VERY MUCH THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SANDRA DINO -- FOR JOINING ME IN OUR COLLEAGUE FROM INGLEWOOD IS JOINT AUTHORS OF THIS RESOLUTION AND STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT. WITH A BIT OF HISTORY. THE CLEAN AIR ACT WAS SUPPORTED. THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. ORIGINALLY SIGNED BY REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHO FOUNDED A REPUBLICAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. THE FIRST WAIVER FOR THE CLEAN AIR ACT WAS REQUESTED BY GOVERNOR RONALD REAGAN. AND HAS RECEIVED RE APPLICATION AND REALLY. APPROVAL OVER A HUNDRED THIRTY TIMES IN FIVE DECADES WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. THAT'S BECAUSE THE WAIVER WORKS. IF YOU ECONOMY STANDARDS WORKS AND AND REALLY AGGRESSIVELY TRYING TO MEET OUR MISSIONS CHALLENGES WORKS. AND WE'VE SEEN THAT FOR DECADES. IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT IS. A GREAT APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF FEDERALISM. BUT I KNOW MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ALSO SUPPORT AS ONE OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL REPUBLICAN BELIEFS. WHICH IS ALLOW OUR STATES TO BE THE ONES TO DECIDE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHAT CAN BE BEST FOR THEM IN FACING THE CHALLENGES. THAT THEY HAVE BEFORE THEM IN CALIFORNIA HAS HISTORICALLY HAD GREAT GREAT CHALLENGES IN ITS AIR QUALITY WE ARE LEADING THE WAY IN ADDRESSING THOSE CHALLENGES BUT THE WAIVER IS A FUNDAMENTAL WAY TO DO THAT. AND THIS IS IT ASKING FOR A SPECIAL FAVOR WE ALREADY HAVE THIS WAIVER AND IT'S BEEN REVOKED FROM US AND THAT IS WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS. SO I WANT TO UNDERSCORE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO REALIZE THE HISTORY OF THIS WAIVER. THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IS HAD FOR DECADES. AND ALSO I REALLY THINK THE WAY WE CAME TOGETHER IN A RESOLUTION AND AND INSTEAD OF ONLY HAVING ONE PARTY. ON ONE RESOLUTION ONE PARTY ON THE OTHER WE CAME TOGETHER IT TOOK PEOPLE WILLING TO DO THAT WE HAVE A MUCH STRONGER VOICE WHEN WE COLLABORATE AND WE HAVE A UNITED MESSAGE WHICH WE CAN DO TODAY. AND TODAY IS THE TIME TO DO IT PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS MEETING WITH THE STATE OFFICIALS RIGHT NOW ABOUT THIS WAIVER AND THE RULES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND SO I VERY STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT -- AND I'D MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS A BIPARTISAN MEASURE WE HAVE A MUCH STRONGER VOICE IN FIGHTING FOR OUR STATE. FOR GOOD POLICY THAT PROTECTS OUR ENVIRONMENT AND BY THE WAY THESE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS THE MORE AND MORE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND MORE FUEL EFFICIENT VEHICLES AND EMISSIONS PROGRAMSTHAT WE'VE DONE IN CALIFORNIA THE MORE AFFORDABLE WE ARE MAKING TRAVEL AND VEHICLE OWNERSHIP AND FUEL IN THIS STATE. AND I WILL SAY IT'S NOT OFTEN ENOUGH THAT WE DO THINGS THAT HELP CALIFORNIANS AFFORD TO LIVE HERE THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO -- BY SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TODAY TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORT OF AG ARE FIFTY REGARDING THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT.

AND SETTING VEHICLE EMISSION STANDARDS THAT IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR ECONOMY AND THE HEALTH OF OUR PEOPLE. THE ABILITY TO PURSUE WAIVERS IS NOW BEING THREATENED BY AN ADMINISTRATION SEEKING TO RESTRICT OUR STATE AUTHORITY. AT A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO MEET OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS AND WE CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS OUR CLIMATE. CHANGE CHALLENGES IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT CALIFORNIA EXERCISES ITS AUTHORITY IN PURSUIT OF THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR PEOPLE. MEMBERS CALIFORNIA IS KNOWN AS THE GOLDEN STATE.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS -- TODAY I ADJOURNMENTS MY COLLEAGUE -- FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY IN THE MEMORY OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN. HIS LIFE AND SERVICE. IS A REFLECTION OF THE BEST OF OUR AMERICAN IDEALS. IN HIS YOUTH. MCCAIN'S AS A NAVY AVIATOR. FOLLOWING IN THE SAME FIGHTING SPIRIT AS HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER BEFORE HIM. WHO ARE BOTH FOUR STAR ADD ROOMS? IN HIS BOOK FAITH OF MY FATHERS MCCAIN WROTE OF THEIR INSPIRATION. WHICH ULTIMATELY LED HIM INTO PUBLIC SERVICE. DURING THE VIETNAM WAR HE VOLUNTEERED FOR COMBAT DUTY IN FLEW CARRIER BASED ATTACK PLANES. IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN HIS A FOR SKY HAWK PLANE WAS SHOT DOWN. AND HE WAS TAKEN PRISONER. FOR OVER FIVE YEARS. THIS WAS THE FIRST TEST OF THE CHARACTER OF JOHN MCCAIN. WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS THE SON OF A NAVY OFFICER MCCAIN WAS OFF YOU OFFERED EARLY RELEASE? SEVERAL TIMES HE WAS OFFERED EARLY RELEASE. BUT HE REFUSED. DESPITE TORTURE. IN PERILOUS CONDITIONS. MCCAIN WOULD NOT ALLOW THOSE TAKEN PRISONER BEFOREHAND BE RELEASED AFTER HIM. IT WAS IN PRISON WHERE MCCAIN LEARNED WHAT IT MEANT. TO LOVE HIS COUNTRY. TO REALLY LOVE HIS COUNTRY. NOT A USEFUL APPRECIATION FOR THE COMFORTS OF AMERICAN PRIVILEGE BUT A MATURE PATRIOTISM. WHICH WAS DISCOVERED THROUGH SACRIFICE. HE DID NOT ALLOW THE INJUSTICES IN INJURIES INFLICTED UPON HIM. TO DETERMINE HIS DESTINY. OR TO DAMPEN HIS PASSION FOR THIS COUNTRY. MCCAIN WAS ULTIMATELY RELEASED. HE CONTINUED PUBLIC SERVICE. AND IS SERVICE TO HIS COUNTRY FIRST AS A NAVY LIAISON TO THE U. S. SENATE. AND THEN DURING THE REAGAN REVOLUTION HE WAS ELECTED. TO THE U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM ARIZONA AND EVENTUALLY. A US SENATOR. IT WAS DURING THIS TIME THAT HE FIRST EARNED THE NICKNAME MAVERICK. BUT TO ME. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THAT NAME. IT'S PROBABLY A MISNOMER. HE HAD VERY DEEPLY HELD CONVICTIONS. AND HE FOLLOWED THEM. WHEREVER THEY LEAD. SOMETIMES THAT PUT HIM AT ODDS WITH HIS PARTY. AND MOST OF HIS CLOSEST COLLEAGUES. BUT HE WAS TRUE [inaudible] HIS CONVICTION. AND HE WAS A MAN OF CHARACTER. MANY KNOW THE REST. SIX TERMS IN THE U. S. SENATE AND TWO PRESIDENTIAL RUNS. NOT FIRST PRESIDENTIAL RUN. IN. TWO THOUSAND I REMEMBER WELL AS A YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENT ON CAMPUS SEEN HIM GOING AROUND THE COUNTRY ON THE STRAIGHT TALK EXPRESS. IT IT WAS A FRESH VIBRANT CANDIDACY WAS. IT WAS MAYBE ONE OF THE FIRST. OR NOT THE FIRST BUT AN EARLY ANTI ESTABLISHMENT [inaudible] CAMPAIGN. I MEAN I REMEMBER AS A YOUNG PERSON. WATCHING HIM IN AND AND HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENCY HAD INSPIRED ME AND INSPIRED MANY YOUNG PEOPLE. ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TO GET INVOLVED IN PUBLIC SERVICE. AND TO SPEAK TRUTH [inaudible] TO POWER. NOW THROUGHOUT HIS TENURE HE WOULD WORK ON MANY ISSUES OBVIOUSLY VETERANS ISSUES HE WAS VERY WELL KNOWN FOR HEALTH CARE. HE TRAVELED THE WORLD -- TO IMPROVE U. S. DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. AND THE COUNTRY. HE WAS ALWAYS A FIERCE ADVOCATE IN THE WORLD THAT THE U. S. HAD TO PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE. IN THE WORLD. THAT WE WERE ESSENTIAL. TO THINGS THAT WERE GOING ON IN THE WORLD AND THAT WE NEEDED TO BE STRONG. IN THE NINETIES BECAME WOULD ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOU ESTA BUT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM. AND SPONSORED THE VETERAN HOSPICE BENEFIT ACT WOULD PROVIDE HOSPICE CARE HOSPICE CARE FOR TERMINALLY ILL VETERANS. IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN HE WAS NAMED IN TIME MAGAZINE HAS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL. PEOPLE IN AMERICA. IN HIS FAREWELL HE WROTE THAT IT WAS A PRIVILEGE TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY. AND THAT BEING CONNECTED TO AMERICA'S CAUSES LIBERTY. EQUAL JUSTICE RESPECT FOR THE DIGNITY OF ALL PEOPLE. BROUGHT HIM MORE HAPPINESS. THEN LIFE'S FLEETING PREP PLEASURES. IT WAS THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. THAT BROUGHT HIM CONTENTMENT AND HE LIVED IT WELL. AND SO TODAY MEMBERS AS WE GATHER TOGETHER AS WE ARE. PRACTICING THE ART OF STATESMANSHIP. AS WE ARE COMING TOGETHER ON FROM DIFFERENT. PARTS OF THE STATE FROM DIFFERENT PARTIES. A FROM DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW BUT ALL WITH THE GOAL OF TRYING. TO TO BETTER OUR STATE TO BETTER OUR NATION I ASKED THAT WE ADJOURN AND THE MEMORY OF OF THE GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOT AND STATESMAN. IN SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER MISTER GABRIEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM NICHOLAS -- FOR INCLUDING ME ON THIS JOURNEY MEMORY AS WE WERE DISCUSSING THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING THIS FOR SENATOR MCCAIN WE FELT THAT. GIVEN HIS ROLE IN OUR DEMOCRACY WOULD BE FITTING AND APPROPRIATE THAT YOU HAVE A BIPARTISAN ADJOURNED IN MEMORY. I ALSO RISE TO ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF SENATOR JOHN CITY MCCAIN OF ARIZONA WHO DIED LAST SATURDAY AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY ONE IN THE COURSE OF HIS LONG PUBLIC SERVICE. SENATOR MCCAIN REPRESENTED THE BEST OF PUBLIC AMERICAN PUBLIC SERVICE [inaudible] COMMITMENT [inaudible] INTEGRITY [inaudible] PERSONAL SACRIFICE. INDEPENDENT THINKING. AND AN ABIDING FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AS WE WAY THE DECISIONS BEFORE US AT THE CLOSE OF THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION WE WOULD DO WELL TO HEED SENATOR MCCAIN'S EXAMPLE. AND EMULATE HIS APPROACH TO LEADERSHIP. MOST NOTABLY SENATOR MCCAIN LIVED OUTSIDE THE BORDERS OF DOGMA. BEYOND THE CLAMOR OF THE POLITICS OF THE DAY. HE WAS BEHOLDEN TO NO ONE ABOVE HIS OWN CONSCIENCE. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HIS LIFE SENATOR MCCAIN BUCK CONVENTION TO LEAD THE BIPARTISAN GANG OF EIGHT ATTEMPTING TO FORGE COMPROMISE ON THE ALWAYS CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC OF IMMIGRATION. THIS WAS JUST ONE MOMENT. IN A IN A LONG ANTHOLOGY OF MOMENTS IN WHICH SENATOR MCCAIN SPENT HIS POLITICAL CAPITAL. TO ADVANCE AN EFFORT WHO SUCCESS WAS FAR FROM GUARANTEED. AS ALWAYS HE WAS UNDETERRED AND UNAFRAID TO TAKE PERSONAL RISKS FOR HIS COUNTRY. THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER SENATOR MCCAIN REJECTED ZEALOUS TRIBALISM AND THE POLITICS OF FEAR. I WILL NEVER FORGET NINE MAGICS THAT'S TRUE OF MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES THE MOMENT DURING THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT CAMPAIGN. WHEN A WOMAN INTO TOWN HALL ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT HIS OPPONENT BARACK OBAMA LADEN WITH RACIAL INNUENDO? SENATOR MCCAIN DIDN'T FLINCH. NO MA'AM HE SAID HE'S A DECENT FAMILY MAN AND A CITIZEN THAT I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE DISAGREEMENTS WITH ON FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES. AND THEN HE MOVED ON THAT MOMENT REVEALED EVERYTHING ONE NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT JOHN MCCAIN'S ESSENTIAL CHARACTER. UNSURPRISINGLY THERE WAS MUCH THAT I PERSONALLY DISAGREED WITH SENATOR MCCAIN ON ON ISSUES OF POLICY IN THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT. AS A YOUNG STAFFER IN UNITED STATES SENATE I WORK FOR A DEMOCRAT WHEN. SENATOR MCCAIN SERVE THERE WAS A LEADING REPUBLICAN. WE WERE OFTEN AT ODDS. BUT IN THAT BODY AS AT EVERY STAGE OF HIS CAREER. SENATOR MCCAIN MAINTAIN THAT OUR FATES AS AMERICANS WERE INTERTWINED IN A WAY IN A WAY THAT TRANSCENDED POLITICS POLICY DIFFERENCES. IN HIS FAREWELL LETTER HE WROTE OUR IDENTITIES AND SENSE OF WORTH ARE NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED BUT ARE IN LARGE BY SERVING GOOD CAUSES. BIGGER THAN OURSELVES. EVEN IN THE SUNSET OF HIS LIFE SENATOR MCCAIN WAS DRIVEN BY THAT NOBLE IDEAL. IN THE DAYS SINCE HIS DEATH IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO TURN ON THE TELEVISION OR GO ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITHOUT SEEING OR HEARING OR WITNESSING A TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MCCAIN. THEY HAVE COME FROM EVERY CORNER OF THIS COUNTRY. AND FROM AMERICANS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS AND FAITHS AND POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS. A COMMON THEME THROUGH EACH TESTIMONY. THE CONSENSUS REACHED BY A JURY OF COLLEAGUES OF ADVERSARIES OF COMPETITORS A FELLOW AMERICANS SAME. JOHN MCCAIN SERVED OUR NATION WITH INTEGRITY WITH HONOR AND WITH TREMENDOUS DEVOTION. AND I BELIEVE AND HOPE AND EXPECT AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID THAT HIS LEGACY. THE WAY THAT HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE AND IN HIS PUBLIC LIFE THE WAY IN WHICH HE SOUGHT TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND TO SPEAK TO OUR HIGHER IDEALS. THAT LEGACY WILL BE A GUIDEPOSTS FOR ALL OF US. AND HIS MEMORY WILL BE A BLESSING FOR OUR NATION. PLEASE JOIN ME TODAY IN ADJOURNING IN MEMORY OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN.
