AND TO DO A DEEP DIVE IN SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST CHALLENGING PRESSING AND INTRACTABLE PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES -- PARTICULARLY AS WE'RE LOOKING AT ISSUES OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND TOXIC STRESSED. THINGS THAT AFFECT -- LARGE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS AND HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON HEALTH. AND THE ROLE OF THE OF MY ROLE AS SURGEON GENERAL IS TO BE NOT ONLY A PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATE BUT ALSO TO BE AN ADVISER TO THE GOVERNOR AND TO BE.

TO BE LEADING THESE EFFORTS AND LEADING A PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGN IN CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL ISSUES. THANK YOU NEXT SPEAKER PLACE. AND I'M CHAIRMAN AT THE THE LAST ITEM ON YOUR AGENDA IS THE REORGANIZATION OF THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY -- AND WE ARE IN THAT YEAH REQUEST FOR ASKING FOR SIX PERMANENT POSITIONS AND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. OUT WE ARE BASICALLY LOOKING -- TO REPURPOSE OR REEF PURPOSE THE FUNCTION OF THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY TO FOCUS ON SOME STRATEGIC INITIATIVES THAT OUR APPLE FOR BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE SECRETARY I'M AND I'M HAPPY CERTAINLY TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL AROUND EACH OF THOSE COMPONENTS -- AT IT AS YOU SEE FIT. WHAT FOR THE AGENCY RESTRUCTURING HOW WILL THIS REORGANIZATION CHANGE POLICY OUTCOMES THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION -- I THINK THE DOCTOR GALLEY -- IS REALLY FOCUSED ON LOOKING AT KEEP PRIORITIES THAT WE AS AN AGENCY FOCUSED ON SO THESE ARE NOT ONLY HIS PRIORITIES BUT OUR COLLECTIVE PRIORITIES AS A STATE IN MOVING TOWARDS A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. AND SO I THINK HIS EXPECTATION IS THAT WE HAVE CLEAR OUTCOMES AND DRIVING TOWARDS PARTICULAR OUTCOMES ON EACH ONE OF THOSE PRIORITIES. AND SO I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE WITH THESE RESOURCES IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST SHUFFLING THE DECK AROUND BUT REALLY STRATEGICALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE LEVERAGE EXISTING RESOURCES WITH A COMBINATION OF THESE IN YOUR RESOURCES TO SAY. WHAT IS IT THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE IN THE NEXT YEAR AND HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE IT AND HAVING THESE RESOURCES REALLY LEVERAGE THEIR VARIOUS TALENTS ACROSS OR TWELVE DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES TO BRING TO FRUITION? THOSE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE HOPING TO CHIEF COLLECTIVELY. CAN YOU OFFER A FEW POTENTIAL EXAMPLES OF INTEREST. ABSOLUTELY NEW SET OUT ONE ONE PARTICULAR AREA IS A MASTER PLAN ON AGING -- I THINK THAT -- WE COLLECTIVELY RECOGNIZE THAT -- IT IS TIME FOR US TO ALL COME TOGETHER AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE ADDRESS THE AGING -- SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA A LOT OF PEOPLE COLLEGES YOU KNOW I MEAN I THINK THAT'S SUCH A BAD TERM BECAUSE I I I THINK IT'S NOT A BAD THING I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD THING THAT PEOPLE ARE AGING WELL. BUT THE GOVERNOR AND THE SECRETARY EXPECT THAT WE PULL TOGETHER PUT PULL TOGETHER MASTER PLAN THAT'S ACTIONABLE AND SO THESE RESOURCES REALLY WOULD BE DESIGNED TO HELP US ENSURE. THAT WITHIN A YEAR NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A PLAN BUT THE PLAN HAS ACTIONABLE OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT TO TRACK OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT DECADE. AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE MOVING THE NEEDLE BOTH AS A GOVERNMENT BUT THEN ALSO OUR PHILANTHROPIC AND ARE FOR PROFIT PARTNERS SO THAT WE'RE ALL CREATE MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF CREATING AGING FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES. SO I THINK THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE HOMELESSNESS IS ANOTHER AREA THAT I THINK THAT THE SECRETARIES VERY MUCH FOCUSED IN ON SO THAT THE PROPOSAL ON MY APOLOGIES AGAIN FOR YOU NOT HAVING IT -- WE LAY OUT THE KEY PRIORITIES OF THE AGENCY AND I THINK THAT WILL. GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE INSIGHT AND WE ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE AS A FOLLOW UP.

ALL RIGHT SEEN NO COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION ON NUMBER. FOUR WE WILL BE HOLDING THAT OPEN. ISSUE NUMBER. FIVE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION ADJUSTMENTS [inaudible] FOR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. YES THANK YOU NANCY PARCHMAN DIRECTOR DDS -- I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND GO THROUGH OF THE ITEMS ON ISSUE FIVE AND THEN CERTAINLY -- WELCOME ANY ANY QUESTIONS. SO FOR THE RELOCATION TO THE CLIFF ALLEN BE BUILDING -- WE ARE REQUESTING THREE POINT FOUR MILLION AND AND ONE POSITION TO FUND -- OUR TRANSITION AND MOVED TO THE NEW BUILDING -- AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE POSITION TO ASSIST US EARLY INTO THE STAGES BECAUSE OF RECORD MANAGEMENT BEING ABLE TO DO. THAT WORK PRIOR TO THE MOVE. FOR THE PORT OF BILLS STABILIZATION TRAINING AND ASSISTANCE -- SERVICES THIS IS ACTUALLY AS A FOLLOW UP ALSO FROM THE REQUEST THAT WE HAVE FOR THE STAR SERVICES. THAT WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- AND THIS IS TO REMIND YOU IS THAT THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF TWO HOMES IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA FOR A TOTAL OF TEN INDIVIDUALS. SO KNOWING THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE ABOUT TWO TO THREE YEARS TO ACTUALLY DEVELOP THAT COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN THE COMMUNITY WE WANTED TO ACTUALLY START SERVING INDIVIDUALS BEFORE THAT. SO THIS PROPOSAL IS TO REQUEST THE FUNDING FOR THE STAFFING POSITIONS TO OPERATE. AT PORTER BILL IN THE INTERIM ON A TEMPORARY BASIS UNTIL WE HAVE THE HOMES IN THE COMMUNITY READY TO SERVE THE INDIVIDUALS. AT THE TIME THAT WE WOULD SERVE THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY THEN WE WOULD NO LONGER BE OPERATING AND AT AT PORTER BILL -- IN THE GENERAL TREATMENT AREA -- FOR THE POPULATION AND STAFFING ADJUSTMENT -- BUT WE ARE REQUESTING AN ADJUSTMENT TO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- THIS IS RELATED TO THE TRANSITION OF THE INDIVIDUALS FROM FAIRVIEW -- TO THE COMMUNITY WELL WE STILL HAVE A PROJECTION OF FIVE UNITS THAT ARE GOING TO BE AN OPERATION AFTER JULY FIRST. OUR PROJECTION IS IS A MIX OF THE POPULATION WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO UNITS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE OPERATING FOR ICF AND TO FOR OUR ANNA. ON BASED ON THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE TRANSITIONING OUT OF OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE TO SWITCH THAT BECAUSE OF THE SWITCH OF THE UNITS WERE GOING TO HAVE THREE UNITS THAT ARE GONNA BE OPERATING UNDER ICF AND WONDER ONE UNDER AN US. THAT IT DOES CHANGE OUR REIMBURSEMENT MIX SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LESS REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER THE FEDERAL DOLLARS -- THAT WE WOULD HAVE WITH WHAT WE HAD PROJECTED WE STILL ARE PROJECTING EVERYBODY MOVING OUT BY THE END OF DECEMBER -- BUT BECAUSE OF THAT WE ARE REQUESTING ADDITIONAL -- FUNDING AUTHORITY -- TO PROVIDE THE STAFFING THAT WOULD BE IN RELATION TO THAT CHANGE OUR POPULATION MAX. FOR REGIONAL CENTER WITH EARLY START COPAYMENTS -- WE ARE REQUESTING AN INCREASE -- AB ONE MILLION DOLLARS SO WE CAN MEET A CONDITION OF OUR FEDERAL GRANT AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO PAY PRIVATELY INSURED FAMILY HE'S FOR CO PAYS. DEDUCTIBLES AND THIS WOULD -- GET TO THE EQUIVALENT TO AN EQUITY INTO WHAT IS REQUIRED UNDER OUR GRANT SO CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE THAT AUTHORITY TO DO THAT THIS WOULD GIVE US THE AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE -- TO HAVE EQUITY INTO THOSE PAYMENTS FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNDER EARLY START -- PROGRAM. FOR FAMILY HOME AGENCY OVERSIGHT WE ARE REQUESTING FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE OVERSIGHT AND TO FAMILY HOME AGENCIES THIS WOULD PROVIDE REGIONAL CENTERS -- POSITIONS WERE -- PROTECTING TWENTY ONE POSITIONS FOR REGIONAL CENTERS TO EXPAND OUR FAMILY HOME AGENCY OPTION THIS IS THE OPTION FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ADULTS. AND IT SIMILAR -- TO FOSTER FAMILY TYPE AGENCY WE WOULD PREDICT WITH THE ADDITIONAL STAFFING AT THE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT WE WOULD IT SPANNED. AT LEAST TEN ADDITIONAL HOMES ACROSS THE STATE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS -- AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT AND AND EXPAND THIS MODEL. FOR THE SPECIALIZED HOME MONITORS THIS IS ACTUALLY A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT FROM WHAT WE HAD IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THIS IS FOR THE FUNDING THAT WE HAD REQUESTED FOR THE BEHAVIOR -- THE B. C. B. A.'S BOARD CERTIFIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSTS -- LOOKING AT THE SALARIES AND LOOKING AT MORE OF A COMPETITIVE SALARY IT WAS A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. TO LIKE THE MID EIGHTIES AND SO THIS IS A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT -- TO UPDATE FROM GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. CASE LOADING UTILIZATION ADJUSTMENT WE ARE REQUESTING AN ADJUSTMENT THIS IS PRIMARILY -- TO TWO FACTORS ONE IS THAT WE ARE PROJECTING ADDITIONAL -- CASELOAD AS COMPARED TO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE INDIVIDUALS IN OUR CASE LOAD. ADDITIONALLY THERE'S THREE ADDITIONAL DRIVERS THAT WE SEE IN OUR UTILIZATION OF SERVICES. ON THEIR FIRST IS WAS SUPPORT SERVICES WE ALSO HAVE A MISCELLANEOUS CATEGORY THAT WERE ALSO SEEN HIGHER UTILIZATION THAN WHAT WE HAD AND HAD PROJECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AS WELL AS WITHIN THE MISCELLANEOUS -- RESPITE SERVICES AND SUPPORT SERVICES ARE THE THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THAT WERE SEEN THOSE. THOSE DRIVERS. THE PROVIDER RATE ADJUSTMENT THIS IS WHAT WAS JUST EARLIER -- MENTIONED UNDER DEPARTMENT OF REHAB SO WE ARE -- REQUESTING -- FUNDING THAT WOULD BE FOR OUR SUPPLEMENTAL RATE ADJUSTMENT AND SO WE'RE PER -- REQUESTING A NINETY EIGHT MILLION FOR GENERAL FUND AND A HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION TOTAL FUND THAT WOULD BE RELATED. TO DDS THIS PORTION OF THE RATE -- SUPPLEMENT THIS IS FOCUSED ON VERY TARGETED AREAS WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CRITICAL AREAS THAT IS. HAVE HEARD. ONE IS TARGETING THE SERVICES WOULD BE COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES WE ARE SEEN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAT ARE COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES THAT ARE ARM. LEVEL IT'S A ADULT RESIDENTIAL MODEL KATE HISTORICALLY ARE THE FACILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN LICENSED AND HAVE BEEN VENDOR IT FOR MANY YEARS THAT WE ARE SEEN AN ANNUAL DECLINE IN THE NUMBER THOSE PROVIDERS. ALSO WAS SUPPORTED LIVING SERVICES SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT WHERE SUPPORT SERVICES THREE CATEGORIES UNDER SUPPORT SERVICES ONE IS PERSONAL ASSISTANCE. BEEN SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT THAT WOULD BE GOING IN TWO DAYS SERVICES RESIDENTIAL SERVICES TRANSPORTATION ASSISTANT THIS IS REALLY GETTING TO A FOCUS OF STABILIZE AND SOME WORK FORCE. WHERE WERE SEEN WHAT THE SUPPORT SERVICES IS USUALLY APPROVED ON A ONE TO ONE SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS WOULD THAT DO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES AND SUPPORTS -- THE PERSONAL ASSISTANTS OFTEN WILL GO INTO SUPPORTED LIVING ENVIRONMENT OR INTO THE FAMILY HOME. AND SEE IF I MISSED ANY. A SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT AND SUPPORTED LIVING AND FAMILY HOME AGENCY I HAD JUST DESCRIBED THE MODEL TO YOU ALSO FOR THE FAMILY HOME AGENCY. COUPLE OF THINGS REGARDING THE THE TARGETED AREAS IS THAT WE DO SEE THAT EACH OF THESE ARE REALLY AN ALIGNMENT WITH C. COMPLIANCE WITH THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WITH OUR FEDERAL DOLLARS. AND BEING ABLE BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEW FEDERAL RULE THE OTHER IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT KIND OF THOE CRITICAL AREAS FOR STABILIZATION. NO I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THE WEEDS OF EVERYTHING BUT I THINK IT'S I DO WANT TO JUST TAKE A MINUTE TO EXPLAIN. HOW WE WOULD BE MOVING FORWARD WITH KIND OF THAT ASSUMPTION WITH THE ALLOCATION IN THE FUNDING FOR EACH OF THESE AREAS? BECAUSE ON AVERAGE IT IS PROJECTED ON ABOUT 18% FOR ALL OF THOSE PROVIDERS. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT BEING ABLE TO DO IT BEING INFORMED BASED ON OUR RATE STUDY THAT WE HAD DISCUSSED -- EARLIER -- AND AND IN DISCUSSING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- BUT WITH THE THE THE RATE STUDY INFORMING US WERE ABLE TO SEE WITHIN EACH OF THESE CTEGORIES KIND OF THIS RELATIVE PERCENTAGE OF IF WE WE HAD IMPLEMENTED THE RATE MODELS. KIND OF WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO. AN INCREASE. RELATIVEACROSS THE STATE OF OF WITH THOSE IN SCOPE SERVICES AND SO BEING ABLE TO USE THAT TO INFORM US AND SAY OKAY USING THAT IS KIND OF OUR FLOOR. SO WITHIN THAT KIND OF FLOOR THAT WE WOULD BE ESTABLISHING THAT ANY PROVIDER THAT WITH THAT IS WITHIN THOSE TARGETED AREAS WOULD BE RAISED UP TO THAT FLOOR THAT WE WOULD. IDENTIFY THAT SENT BEING INFORMED BY THE RATE MODELS. BUT ANYBODY THAT'S ABOVE IT WOULD NOT BE REDUCED. SO WE WOULD NOT BE PROTECTING ANY REDUCTION OF RATES FOR ANYBODY IF THEY WERE NOT -- ANTICIPATING A RATE INCREASE SO WE JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I KNOW MANY OF OUR PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN VERY CONCERNED. THAT THEY WOULD BE RECEIVING A RATE REDUCTION AND SO I I DID WANT TO PROVIDE THAT CLARIFICATION AS WELL -- WE WOULD BE TAKING THE INFORMATION BACK TO OUR RATE STUDY WORK GROUP WHO HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN OUR RATE STUDY -- IT IS A PART OF OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE SO WE WILL BE DOING THAT BECAUSE ONE OF THE ELEMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTING. ANY RATE ADJUSTMENT WITHIN OUR WAIVER SERVICES IS THAT WE DO NEED TO HAVE PUBLIC -- PARTICIPATION IN AND PUT AND THEN THE PROCESS THAT WE WOULD NEED TO AND TELL ON THIS IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO GO -- TO THE FEDERAL -- APPLY FOR CMS APPROVAL ON IT WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT WE'D BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY NOW THERE IS THIS -- A SUNSET OF THE INCREASE THAT WOULD BE IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE ALSO AS A PART OF IT IS YOUR NEXT ITEM ON YOUR AGENDA IS A UNIFORM HOLIDAY IS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING. TO SUSPEND THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY UNTIL DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT THE HALF DAY BILLING IS -- A A COST SAVING MEASURE THAT HAD BEEN PUT IN PLACE IN THE PAST THAT THIS IS NOT A PART OF THAT THAT IT WOULD CONTINUE AS PART OF OUR PROPOSAL -- GOING INTO. NINETEEN TWENTY THE LAST ITEM UNDER ISSUE FIVE IS BEST BUDDIES A REQUEST INCREASE OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THIS WOULD MAKE THE CONTRACT A TOTAL OF TWO MILLION. AS PART OF THE INCREASE AND PART OF THE CONTRACT THAT WOULD BE MOVING FORWARD WOULD HAVING WOULD BE -- SOME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO INCLUDE BEING ABLE TO REPORT OUT THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE RECEIVING SERVICES. AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. SENATE PADDOCK LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OUR OFFICE HAS POINTS TO MAKE ON FOUR OF THE ISSUES PRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. THE FIRST CONCERNS THE MOVE TO THE NEW ALLEN BE BUILDING THIS IS JUST A MINOR TECHNICAL POINT ABOUT THE PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED FOR DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS AND DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES -- THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THIS -- PROPOSED WOULD EXEMPT THE DEPARTMENT FROM HAVING TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TO GENERAL SERVICES ON DOCUMENT ARCHIVAL AND SCANNING AND DESTRUCTION BECAUSE TGS WOULD COST ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH AS A THIRD PARTY VENDOR. TO DO THAT WORK -- BUT THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ALSO EXAMS THE DEPARTMENT FROM HAVING TO FOLLOW THE PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE IN SETTING UP THOSE THIRD PARTY CONTRACTS. SO WHAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND WE AGREE THAT IT PROBABLY MAKES SENSE NOT TO USE THE HIGHER COST OPTION UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. BUT WE PROPOSE CHANGING THE LANGUAGE SLIGHTLY TO NOT EXEMPT THE DEPARTMENT FROM THE PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE -- SIMPLY -- HAVE IT SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORK WITH THE GS. SO IT'S A MINOR POINT ON ON THE MOVE -- THE SECOND POINT HAS TO DO WITH THE POPULATION AND STAFFING ADJUSTMENT AT FAIRVIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER -- HERE WE JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO KEEP AN INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITY UNIT. OPEN IN TO TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY IS BECAUSE SEVERAL RESIDENTS THAT HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE HAD TO MOVE. BACK TO THE FAIRVIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AND WE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED TO THE DEPARTMENT WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THESE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS HAVE COMPLEX. CHALLENGES -- SEVERE OF BEHAVIORAL -- CHALLENGES TO ADDRESS -- BUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT IT'S GOING TO COST AN ADDITIONAL TEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND -- TO KEEP THAT ICF UNIT OPEN -- AND IT'S IT MIGHT BE WORTH HAVING SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT WHAT LED TO THESE RESIDENTS HAVING TO MOVE BACK AND WHAT KINDS OF LESSONS LEARNED MIGHT BE TAKEN INTO THE FUTURE. OKAY ON THE ISSUE OF THE PROVIDER RATE ADJUSTMENT -- WE WOULD NOT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL DOES USE FINDINGS FROM THE RECENT READ RECENTLY RELEASED RATE STUDY IN A BENEFICIAL WAY TO INFORM THE DESIGN OF THE TEMPORARY RATE INCREASES. AS DIRECTOR BARGE MEN NOTED IT WOULD -- TARGET PROVIDERS IN THE CATEGORIES THAT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN -- MOST UNDER FUNDED IN RECENT YEARS -- IN ATTEMPTS TO APPLY ADJUSTMENTS FOR REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN COST AND IT ATTEMPTS TO CREATE SOME PARITY ACROSS PROVIDERS -- OF THE THE SAME TYPES OF SERVICES IN THE SAME TYPES OF AREAS. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE FOUR KEY CONCERNS ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH AND NOTE THAT IT FUNDAMENTALLY MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION OF RATE REFORM IN THE SYSTEM. AND IN FACT THIS WAS A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY THAT LED TO THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED RATE STUDY IN THE FIRST PLACE. FIRST OF THE FUNDING PROPOSAL IS MODEST RELATIVE TO THE RATE STUDIES IDENTIFIED FUNDING GAPS. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASE WHICH IS ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN NINETEEN TWENTY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. FALLS FAR SHORT OF WHAT THE RATE STUDY IMPLIES IS NEEDED IN THE SYSTEM WHICH IS ABOUT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. SECOND THE PROPOSED SUNSET OF RATE INCREASES RAISES CONCERNS. THE REVISED BUDGET IN EFFECT TREATS SERVICES THAT ARE FUND OF FUNDAMENTALLY ONGOING IN NATURE AS TEMPORARY WHICH ULTIMATELY CREATES PROGRAMMATIC CHALLENGES. AND INCREASES COST PRESSURES. THE TARGETED SERVICES FUNDED WITH THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASES WILL STILL BE NEEDED BY DDS CONSUMERS AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION NOTES THAT ONE RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASES IS TO STABILIZE CAPACITY IN RESIDENTIAL SERVICES. AND TO STABILIZE CAPACITY OF THE WORK FORCE IN OTHER SERVICE CATEGORIES. ENDING THE RATE INCREASES IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WOULD HAVE A DESTABILIZING AFFECT. OUR OFFICE IS NOTED IN ITS INITIAL COMMENTS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S ME REVISION -- THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES SUNSETS ACROSS A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS IN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES [inaudible] IT AREAS. AND THEY SUGGEST THIS TO MAINTAIN A BALANCE BUDGET THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD ENDING. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE OUR OFFICE HAS RAISED A NUMBER OF CONCERNS ABOUT THIS APPROACH FINDING THAT THE MAYOR REVISION UNDERSTATES THE TRUE ONGOING COST OF ITS POLICY COMMITMENTS. OUR THIRD CONCERN IS THAT THE RATE INCREASE PROPOSAL LIMITS THE SCOPE OF WHO BENEFITS FROM THE FISCAL RELIEF PROVIDED. WE SEE THE MERIT OF TARGETING RATE INCREASES AS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED BECAUSE TARGETING IS TYPICALLY A MORE COST EFFICIENT METHOD. THEN ACROSS THE BOARD RATE INCREASES HOWEVER WE DO NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND SUB EXCLUDING A LARGE SHARE OF SERVICE PROVIDERS -- USING THIS APPROACH. FINALLY WE NOTE THAT THE PROPOSAL -- POSTPONES RATE REFORM. THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS MADE RATE REFORM IS A EARLIER NOTED A A PRIORITY IN THE DDS SYSTEM IT'S THE REASON THAT IT CALLED FOR THE RATE STUDY. AND IT'S THE REASON THAT IT'S DELAYED DECISIONS ABOUT INCREASING RATES IN THE INTERVENING YEARS. THE ADMINISTRATION'S CURRENT PROPOSAL WELL INFORMED BY THE RATE STUDY DOES NOT BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT ANY OF THE RATE MODELS SUCH AS THROUGH A STAGE ROLLOUT OR THROUGH AND OR THROUGH PILOT PROJECTS AS OUR OFFICE HAS SUGGESTED TO THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IN A LETTER. DATED MAY SECOND. WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT IF IMPLEMENTED IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY KIND IS NOT IS DELAYED THE MOMENTUM TO BEGIN RATE REFORM WILL BE LOST -- I WANTED TO MENTION THAT I THAT ONE QUESTION CAME UP HIS PERMIT WAS MAKING ITS PRESENTATION. IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING ON THE ISSUE OF THE AS THE CRISIS UNITS THAT WOULD BE TEMPORARILY HOUSED AT THE PORT OF BILL DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT FUNDING WOULD BE ONE TIME IN -- TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE WAY IT IT WAS JUST PRESENTED IT SOUNDED AS THOUGH THAT COULD LAST FOR TWO TO THREE YEARS -- WE SUGGEST THAT YOU MAY WANT TO CLARIFY THAT ISSUE BECAUSE AGREEING TO FUND -- THOSE SERVICES THIS YEAR YOU MAY BE ESSENTIALLY COMMITTING TO FUNDING IT. FOR FOR TWO TO THREE YEARS IN TOTAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Q. LIKE SPEAKER PLEASE.

UNDER THE SPECIALIZED HOME MONITORS ISSUE WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO THE ADMINISTRATION -- FOR MAKING THIS ADJUSTMENT -- A POINT THAT WE BROUGHT OUT IN THE JANUARY OF BUDGET REVIEW OF THIS SO SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE PROVIDER RATE ISSUE WE WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR ITS FIRST. FORAY INTO THE WORLD OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SINCE FUNDING A SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN GROSSLY UNDERFUNDED OVER. THE YEARS BUT WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH MANY OF THE COMMENTS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST -- ON ON THIS PROPOSAL IN THAT SO WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR IT BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT -- AN 8% INCREASE -- ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ALL THOSE OTHER PROVIDERS WHO HAVE BEEN -- WOEFULLY FUNDED FOR MANY YEARS TO BE PART OF THAT -- THAT PROGRAM -- IN PROPOSAL HAD AS YOU MOVE FORWARD IN ON THE ISSUE OF THE SUNSET ON THE RATE TO INCREASES SO WE BELIEVE AT THE VERY LEAST THAT YOU'D WANT TO SUNSET. IN ANYTHING ONCE -- THE FULL RATE STUDY HAS BEEN FUNDED AND NOT OF ESSENTIALLY POTENTIALLY PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER OUR PROVIDER COMMUNITY WITH TEMPORARY RATE INCREASES. AND LASTLY OF AND THEN SKEWS ME THE NEXT ITEM ON PAGE NUMBER EIGHT OF THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE A SUSPENSION OF WE APPRECIATE -- THE DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS -- WHAT WE REFER TO AS A FURLOUGH PROGRAM WE HAVE ALWAYS SO STRONGLY ADVOCATED FOR THE REPEAL OF THIS? PROPOSAL -- THAT WAS PUT IN DURING VERY A TOUGH BUDGET TIMES. YEARS AGO. AND THEN ON PAGE NUMBER -- NINE THE REGIONAL CENTER ACCOUNTABILITY OVERSIGHT MONITORING WE'D LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE FUNDING. THAT SO GOING ALONG WITH THIS TO HELP A REGIONAL CENTERS -- IMPLEMENT THESE CHANGES AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING RATE INCREASES IN THE RATE. OF PORTION OF YOUR AGENDA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- CARL LUNDEN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES. A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION OF COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFITS THAT. SUPPORT THIS POPULATION IN THE COMMUNITY AND AGAIN I'D LIKE TO REITERATE OUR SUPPORT. FOR THE ANALYSIS PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST -- IN PARTICULAR ON ISSUE FOR TEN PAGE SEVEN OF THE PROVIDER RATE ADJUSTMENTS. I WOULD JUST NOTE AGAIN ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE LEFT OUT IN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. HAS HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOW DRAMATICALLY UNDERFUNDED. THE COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS ARE AND HAVE BEEN IN THE IMPACT UPON THE PEOPLE THAT SERVE THOSE -- POPULATIONS WE HAVE WAITING LISTS ALL OF THE STATE WE HAVE WAITING LISTS ARE CLOSE AROUND THE STATE. AND I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THIS PROPOSAL IN THE MAY REVISE LEAVES OUT. OF PROGRAMS FOR FUNDING OF EVERY MEMBER THE SETS ON THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. QUESTIONS WHY BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE CLEARLY DONE YEARS HAVE INDICATION BY THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO FUND PART OF THE RATE STUDY. BUT THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE OTHER PROGRAMS OUT UNTIL THEY FIGURE OUT HOW THE ONE IMPLEMENT THE RACE REST OF THE RATE STUDY. WE THINK THAT'S A WHOLLY INAPPROPRIATE WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS WE WOULD ASK INSTEAD. THAT YOU STRONGLY CONSIDER THE FRAZIER HOLDEN -- HENRY STERN AND MR MATHIS PROPOSAL TO HAVE AT LEAST AN 8% PROPOSAL ACROSS THE BOARD WHILE WE FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THIS RATE STUDY. CONVERSATIONS ARE GREAT WE CAN HAVE IN THE SUMMER AND INTO THE FALL BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE FUNDING SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SERVE PEOPLE THE WORKERS WILL BE LOST FROM THOSE PROGRAMS. AND WE'LL JUST CONTINUE EVANESCENCE SYSTEM SO WE WE LOVE THE FIRST FORAY INTO THIS BUT WE YOU CANNOT LEAVE OTHER PROGRAMS BEHIND WE URGE YOU TO ADOPT. A DIFFERENT PATH IN THAT SECONDLY -- UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE AGAIN JUST A REMINDER THESE A RECESSION ERA CUTS FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THAT WERE STILL LEAVING ON THE BOOKS. AND WE'RE SIMPLY GETTING A REPEAL FOR A YEAR OR YEAR AND A HALF FROM THAT WOULD SUPPORTERS GETTING ALL THE WAY REPEAL ALL THE WAY IT LASTLY -- PGD ON THE BEST BUDDIES THE FUNDING I HATE TO SAY THIS WITH ALL DUE RESPECT IT'S A GREAT PROGRAM. BUT WE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS AUGMENTATION THIS PROGRAM IS NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAM IN THE STATE. THAT OFFER SERVICES TO THIS POPULATION AND A SINGLE THEM OUT FOR AN AUGMENTATION AND ALL THE OTHER PROGRAMS. ARE STRUGGLING FOR CRUMBS WE JUST LEAVE IS WHOLLY INAPPROPRIATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. HELLO I'M JACQUI DELUDE FOSTER THE CALIFORNIA SUPPORT OF THE NETWORK -- ONE IS WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT PERSONAL SUPPORT PERSONAL SUPPORT FOR THE NETWORK INCLUDE SUPPORTED LIVING SERVICES PERSONAL ASSISTANCE INDEPENDENT LIVING AND RESPITE SO. PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DID NOT RECOGNIZE INDEPENDENT LIVING OR RESPITE SERVICES WHICH IS THAT -- SAME ARRAY OF SERVICES. THE OTHER IS I AM JUST AS CONCERNED. AROUND THE LACK OF VISION AROUND THIS RATE STUDY THE STUDIES DONE AND IT'S TIME FOR IMPLEMENTATION SO WE HAVE A RATE STUDY WE'RE GOING. TO HOPEFULLY HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE RATE STUDY AND I'M JUST HOPING THAT IN A YEAR'S TIME OR TWO YEARS TIME WE'RE NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT A STUDY THAT'S BEEN DONE IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE A RESOLUTION FOR OUR COMMUNITY -- AND THE OTHER ONE AROUND SUPPORTIVE LIVING SERVICES I DO HOPE THAT PART OF THIS CONVERSATION IS HOW TO MOVE SUPPORTIVE LIVING SERVICES TOWARD AN HOURLY RATE. THAT MAKES SENSE PERSONAL ASSISTANCE IS ACCESSED IN SUPPORTED LIVING SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE CONFUSION OF THE RATE STRUCTURE WE HAVE NOW. BURNSAND ASSOCIATE RECOMMENDED AN HOURLY RATE SYSTEM THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND SO THE NETWORK LOOKS FORWARD TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION. AS WELL AND THE OTHER IS AROUND THE SUNSET. BECAUSE ALEJO'S OFFICE IS RIGHT ON TARGET YOU CANNOT TELL A DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL YOU GET A WAGE A WAGE INCREASE. IT TILL. TWENTY TWENTY TWO IT'S A IT'S DESTABILIZING FOR OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM NO ONE WOULD WANT TO SAY THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET IF IT'S A STEP TOWARDS THE RATE STUDY. AND THIS RATE IMPLEMENTATION LET'S BEGIN TO BRIDGE THIS AND LET'S BEGIN TO WORK FORWARD TO THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. THAN NOT HAVING US HAVE THIS SAME CONVERSATION YEAR AFTER YEAR BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I AM OF THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS. AND THE LAST CONVERSATION I WANT TO HAVE ONE MORE IS AROUND THE WORK FORCE THE ENTIRE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM DEPENDS ON EIGHT A QUALIFIED. DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL WORKFORCE WE CONTINUE TO NOT RECOGNIZE THEM THE LAST COMMENT ON THIS IS I WAS LISTENING TO SOMEONE FROM NEW YORK SAY THAT WE CONTINUE TO SAY WE HAVE A CRISIS WE DO NOT HAVE A CRISIS WE TALKED ABOUT THE CRISIS. IN THE WORK FORCE FOR FIFTY YEARS WE HAVE A SYSTEMATIC FAILURE YOU HAVE A RATE STUDY TO BEGIN TO LOOK AT THE SYSTEMATIC FAILURE FIX THE FAILURE SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD SO PEOPLE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES GET THE BEST AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DESERVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI NANCY CHANCE CHOICES PERSON CENTERED SERVICES CALIFORNIA PERSON CENTERED PARTNERSHIP AND A PATH TOWARD COLLABORATIVE -- I AM. I ALSO WANT TO THANK -- THE ADMINISTRATION FOR PUTTING FORWARD SOME SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING I THINK THAT IT'S A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- BUT I WOULD ALSO I ALSO SUPPORT THE IDEA OF IMPLEMENTING THE RATE STUDY EVEN IF WE HAVE TO PHASE IT IN THERE ARE SOME PARTS OF THE RATE CITY I THINK THAT ARE READY THAT COULD BE STARTED NOW INSTEAD OF WAITING AND CONTINUING TO DISCUSS IT -- BUT SHORT OF OF IMPLEMENTING THE THE RATE STUDY -- WE WE I SUPPORT THAT THE THE SUPPLEMENTAL PROVIDER RATE INCREASE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDED -- INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES AND IN HOME RESPITE AS THOSE ARE ALSO PERSONAL SUPPORT -- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO URGE THE LEGISLATURE -- TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS -- TO FIND A WAY TO FULLY FUND HE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE AND THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ON GOING -- INCREASES IN THE MINIMUM WAGE WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO FULLY FUND THAT NOT JUST FIND THE PEOPLE THAT. OUR BILL ARE ARE PAYING MINIMUM WAGE BUT PEOPLE ABOVE THAT I MEAN WE JUST CAN'T GET AWAY FROM WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE LESS MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE PROVIDERS IF WE DON'T DO THAT -- AND WHAT WE DO IS NOT AN ENTRY LEVEL JOB -- LASTLY I'D LIKE TO AND SAY I I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE SUSPENSION OF THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY OR THE FURLOUGHS BUT I I TOO WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT -- REPEALED NOT JUST NOT JUST A SIX MINUTE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS STAFF JORDAN IN THE WITH THE ARK OF CALIFORNIANS ARE Q. C. P. CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE -- WE WANT TO HOLY ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE LA -- AND STRONG'S ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE -- TO DO THE SAME -- FEW COMES JUST TO EXPAND ON IT A LITTLE BIT -- AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE MODEST INVESTMENTS HOWEVER WE BELIEVE IT FALLS FAR SHORT OF SERIOUS IN MEANINGFUL INVESTMENT -- TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOP THE DISABILITIES -- WE HEARD THE ADMINISTRATION -- LINK THE THE SERVICES THAT WERE SELECTED TO EIGHT CBS -- JUST JUST THINGS THAT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHEN WE ARE CLEAR SO I FEEL LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT A STAB IN THE DARK I'M WE DON'T HAVE A FINAL IMPROVE STATE PLAN YET. I DON'T THINK IT'S THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTENT TO SAY THAT NINETY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE SERVICES FOR THEIR DAY PROGRAMS AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND JOB COACHING TO THE DAY PROGRAMS. ARE NO LONGER GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE IN TWO YEARS I DON'T THINK THAT'S BUT THAT'S KIND OF THE MESSAGE WE'RE GETTING BY SELECTING CERTAIN SERVICES -- SO IT'S A LITTLE A STAB IN THE DARK STILL. SO AT WE WHILE IF THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS -- TO ENHANCE CERTAIN SERVICES UP TOWARDS 18% WE FULLY SUPPORT THAT AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE AS YOU'VE HEARD THERE ARE CRITICAL SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THATNEED INVESTMENT NOW AS WELL AS WITH A MINIMUM OF 8%. FOR THE OTHERS AS WELL AS WHAT WE WOULD PROPOSE -- JUST SINCE THE MAYBE VICE CAME OUT I SPOKE WITH PROVIDERS IN SAN JOAQUIN LA IN RIVERSIDE ALL WHO SAID THOSE STATE PROGRAMS WHICH PROVIDE VOCATIONAL TRAINING THIS IS THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN IF THEY DON'T RECEIVE THE INVESTMENT THIS YEAR. THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN SHUTTING DOWN SOME NOW NOW IT'S IT'S GONE AFTER THIS -- FINALLY ACTUALLY NUMBER THREE IN THE THIRD COM IS REGARDING THE SUNSET AGAIN ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH OTHERS HAVE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A SUNSET WE CAN'T. WE CAN'T ALLOW SOMEBODY'S BRAIDED LIFE OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO ALL OF A SUDDEN SAY. IN TWO YEARS BY THE WAY WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE SO IN MUST BE TIED TO A SUNSET OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE STUDY. AND FINALLY THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE WE REALLY REALLY ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE. TO PUT THIS TO TO READ TO PUT THIS TO TO REST FINALLY AND DON'T SUNSET THE UNIFORMHOLIDAY SCHEDULE BUT JUST ELIMINATE. IT ENTIRELY WE KNOW WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISED THERE IS NOT THE ELIMINATION OF HALF THE BILLING WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE IMPACTS WE WISH THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPLANTED ELIMINATED. ALSO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN THIS COMMITTEE AND BY THE LA OWES AN ANALYSIS OF THE MINIMUM WAGE QUIRK -- WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD WAY TO PUT IT REGARDING AND STARTING JANUARY ONE AND THEN AGAIN AFTER THAT. SOME WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES MANY THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN THOSE IN HIGH COST REGIONS WHERE THE MAN WE JUST HIGHER WILL NOT RECEIVE ANYTHING SO THOUGH IT THEY'RE GONNA BE IMPACTED. JANUARY ONE AGAIN WE WISH THAT THAT WAS RESOLVED -- IN THIS BUDGET WE HOPE THAT YOU CAN DO SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JIM GROSS ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION THE ONLY THING I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH MEMBERS AND STAFF. WE ALL HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THROUGH THE RATE STUDY THERE IS GOING TO BE -- A DECISION MADE ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF SERVICES PERFORM BEST ETCETERA ETCETERA UNFORTUNATELY YES AS MUCH AS THE MINISTRATION HAS TRIED TO ADDRESS. OUR OVERALL PROBLEM IT IT CAN'T LEAVE OUT CERTAIN SERVICES THAT ARE STILL VERY MUCH A PART OF THE SYSTEM AND STILL CENTRAL THE LONG TERM DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RATE STUDY WILL YIELD. DISCUSSION ABOUT PARTICULAR INVESTMENT IN PARTICULAR SERVICE CODE WE'RE NOT THERE YET WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE SYSTEM AS IT IS. UNFORTUNATELY WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL WILL MAKE THINGS WORSE IN A LOT OF ASPECTS OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS TOOK ME WHAT WHAT DOES THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF ITEM ISSUE -- FOUR OH SEVEN THE FAMILY HOME AGENCY OVERSIGHT AND WOULD JUST LIKE TO ECHO MY COMMENTS ON ISSUE -- FOR TEN FROM COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY STATED -- THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT THE CLIENTS AND THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED TO THE CLIENTS AND WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP THEM IN MIND -- PICKING AND CHOOSING WHAT WE DO AND WHAT WE DON'T DO WAS UNFAIR WHICH IS WHY WE SUPPORT 8% ACROSS THE BOARD AS CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE -- TO BE HAD SO WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KEVIN ROTH I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORTED LIVING NETWORK I HAVE -- A DOCUMENT FOR THE COMMITTEE AND THIS DOCUMENT SPECIFICALLY JUST SHOWS 55%. OF WE JUST CENTER CONSUMERS USE PERSONAL SUPPORTS. SO WE SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S OF FUNDING OF SPORT LIVING IN PERSONAL ASSISTANTS BUT IT LEAVES OUT RESPITE WHICH PROVIDES WHICH IS USED BY 32% OF REGIONAL CLIENTS. AND ALSO INDEPENDENT LIVING 6% SAYS 38% PEOPLE AND IT'S A SURPRISINGLY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY. CURRENTLY THERE -- THOSE FOR THIS PERSONAL SPORTS ONLY USE UP THE ROLLOUT THAT SEE SOMEONE HAS SUPPORTED AND THE RICH THE SPORT WITH SOME FOR MINOR FIXES WOULD JUST RESULT IN AN EXTRA 6% -- OF THAT AND WE URGE THAT THAT -- THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND LEGISLATURE CONSIDER THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MARTY EMOTO FAMILY MEMBER CALIFORNIA DISPLACING YOUR COMMUNITY ACTION NETWORK IN THE CALIFORNIA PERSON CENTERED ADVOCACY. PARTNERSHIP IN THE PASSWORD -- COLLABORATIVE FIRST -- ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE INCLUSION OF INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES AN IN HOME RESPITE -- IN TERMS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL PROVIDER RATE ADJUSTMENT I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE. ECHO SO WHAT THE L. LEO HAD PREVIOUSLY SUGGEST AS ONE OF THE OPTIONS. NUMBER TWO STRONGLY -- SUPPORT THE THINGS THAT THE LA -- SIX MENTION. IN TERMS OF THEIR REACTION TO THE MAY REVISE ON ON THE ISSUE OF THE RATE STUDY. AND STRONGLY URGE THAT. THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUT INTO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SOME ACTUAL ACTION DATES -- YOU NOTE TO HAVE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE RATE STUDY INCLUDING SOME TEMPLATES ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED DURING THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY YEAR INCLUDING. MOVING FORWARD ON PILOTS AND TARGETING THOSE IMPLEMENTATIONS TOWARDS REDUCING DISPARITIES. AND MEETING THE OTHER STATE PRIORITIES -- WE THINK THAT'S THE BEST APPROACH THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S LANDLORD I AM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF BE BERRY INK OF SERVING NAPA SOLANO CINEMA IN THE COUNTIES -- I'M ALSO A FORMER REGIONAL CENTER EMPLOYEE OF FOURTEEN YEARS SO HAVING THE OVERALL PICTURE. OF BEING A PROVIDER OF SERVICES AT EXTREME CHALLENGE -- WITH THE THE FISCAL CONSTRAINTS SO I'M VERY EXCITED THAT WE'RE EVEN HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT TO SIMPLY ASK THAT THERE IS NO SUNSET TO THE INCREASE BECAUSE THAT WILL BE COMPLETELY DESTABILIZING. I'M CURRENTLY HAVING -- TO WORK REALLY HARD TO BALANCE MY BUDGET THIS YEAR. IN A WAY TO GET AN INCREASE TWO YEARS LATER. OF THAT INCREASES GONE OF I WILL BE BACK TO THIS VERY VERY CHALLENGING YEAR THAT I'M EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW -- SECONDLY I WOULD ASK THAT. OF OTHER SERVICES THAT WERE NOT CONSIDERED BE CONSIDERED AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE. FIVE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THIS RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO ALSO -- EXPRESS THE DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE GOVERNOR'S NOT INCLUDING THE PERCENT ACROSS THE BOARD I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT -- FOR FOR THE STABLE. THAT. STABILITY THANK YOU A SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNER -- STABILITY OF THE FOR THE PROGRAM BUT I ALSO WANT -- TO INDICATE THAT -- THE THIRTY SIX ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND OTHERS SENATORS I WROTE A LETTER ASKING FOR THE FUNDING AND I'M HOPING THAT -- WE CAN HAVE THIS ITEM ON THE AGENDA SO THAT WE CAN DISCUSS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY -- TO HAVE THE STATE -- THE THE RATES -- STABILIZED AND HOPEFULLY WORKING THROUGH WITH THE COMMITTEE THERE'S A WAY TO PUT IT BACK ON THE AGENDA AT LEAST FOR ANOTHER DISCUSSION AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO SOMETHING -- ON THE TWENTY FIRST I KNOW THAT WE'RE RUNNING UP AGAINST THE CLOCK AT THIS POINT BY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REALIZE THAT THE DISABILITY OF THE ID COMMUNITY -- IS IMPORTANT TO US AND WE'VE INDICATED THAT YOU KNOW ACTUALLY THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT AND SO -- AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF WE CAN INCLUDE THIS ITEM BACK ON THE AGENDA FOR THE FOR NEXT WEEK BEFORE THE TWENTY FIRST THANK YOU. YES DOCTOR WOULD. YES -- GOT A COUPLE OF THINGS WE'VE HEARD OBVIOUS A LOT OF COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROVIDER RATE ADJUSTMENT AND AND HAVING TO SUNSET AND AND I AM AND I I AGREE THAT I THINK THAT WOULD BE TO STABILIZING. THE THE RATE ADJUSTMENT IS THIS A RESTORATION OF FROM CUTS AND I SHOULD KNOW THIS AND I DON'T I APOLOGIZE OR IS THIS A TRUE RATE INCREASE. THE COMPARING IT BACK TO WHAT IS. OVER THE YEARS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE OUTLINED IN THE RATE STUDY IS THE COMPLEXITIES OF KIND OF THE HISTORY IN THE EVOLUTION OF RATES -- THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EVENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS WITHIN THEIR RATES SO YOU WE HAVE. DIFFERENT WAYS SAID OUR SYSTEM HAS SET RATES WE HAVE OUR DEPARTMENTS THAT RATES WE HAVE STATUTORILY SET RATES WE HAVE NEGOTIATED RATES -- WE HAVE SOME NEW MODELS TO SERVICE YOU KNOW THAT -- ACTUALLY ARE NOT WITHIN KIND OF THE THE MEDIAN RATE REQUIREMENTS OR THE RATE FREEZES. SO OVER TIME THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE HAVE SET RATES AT DIFFERENT STAGES -- WHAT THE RATE STUDY DID IS REALLY TOOK AT A LOOK AT -- A PROCESS THAT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE YOU KNOW IT LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE COSTS THAT BUILD WITHIN THE DIFFERENT RATES OF THOSE IN SCOPE SERVICES. SO IT WAS KIND OF AS ZERO BE SEEN IF YOU WILL AND LOOKING AT HOW TO DEVELOP A RATE MODEL -- INTO DELIVERING A SERVICE SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT. IS NOT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION IN THE SENSE OF SAYING DOES IT GO BACK AND AND TAKE CARE OF ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN IN THE PAST OR TIMES WHERE THERE WERE RATE FREEZES OR MEDIAN RIGHT. BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS KIND OF ZERO BASED AND HAVE AN INFORMED INFORMATIVE PROCESS OF BUILDING A RATE MODELS. SO I GUESS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR IS I WANTED TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF THIS. IS A RESTORATION OF RATE CUTS IT MAY HAVE HAPPENED DURING THE RECESSION. AND THAT YET BUT WHAT WOULD GIVE YOU TELLING ME AS ANYONE ZERO THERE WERE NO -- IT WHERE THEIR RATE K.. AS SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. YOU GO TO ZERO YOU GONNA ZERO BASE BASED ON NOW. BUT I WANT TO I WANT TO KNOW YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE ARE THE RATES BASED. GOOD BE BASED ON IS ARE LOOKING FOR HIM HOW MUCH HOW MUCH WAS RESTORED OVER TIME -- OR OR WAS IT. MAYBE JUST MAYBE THE LA -- CAN HELP ME THERE. SO I'M NOT I MEAN I'M I'M CAN HAVE OTHERS TRY. TO IT IT IT MAKES TRYING TO CLARIFY THIS BECAUSE I GUESS MY I GUESS MY MY OVERALL POINT IS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE SUSPENSION FOR EXAMPLE THAT WAS A RECESSION ERA POLICY CORRECT. THERE WAS THAT WAS A RECESSION ERA AND THERE WAS A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WERE RELATED -- TO ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN THAT HAVE BEEN RESTORED OVER TIME THERE WAS A REDUCTION BACK AND DURING THE COST SAVING MEASURES OF IF IT'S A YOU KNOW. THERE IS A REDUCTION OF PROVIDER -- REDUCTIONS DURING THAT TIME I THINK IT'S LIKE 4% THERE IS A REDUCTION THOSE A RESTORED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WERE RESTORED -- THE UNIFORM HOLLIS HOLIDAY IS SOMETHING THAT WERE SUSPENDED WE'RE PROPOSING FOR SUSPENSION RIGHT NOW THAT WAS A PART OF THE THE TIME OF THE ECONOMIC. DOWNFALL -- AS FAR AS SEPARATING OUT TO GET TO THE RATE STUDY. BECAUSE THAT WAS ABOUT ACTUALLY DEVELOPING RIGHT MODELS BASED ON SERVICE -- TO GET TO HOW DOES THAT COMPARE -- TO THE HISTORY OF DIFFERENT ACTIONS I'M NOT QUITE SURE THERE'S THERE'S A APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON THAT CAN BE THERE. WELL. THE THEM I'M SORRY I'M NOT TRYING TO MUDDY THE WATERS BUT I GUESS IN GENERAL WE ARE IN. FAIRLY GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE -- RECORD SURPLUSES -- AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SUSPENSION A RECESSION ERA POLICY -- THAT WE'RE GOING TO KIND TO RESTORE. SO AS WE START SPENDING MORE MONEY ON A LOT OF ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS OUT THERE MY POINT WITH THIS IS THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF PROGRAM'S. WEATHER'S RELATED TO SENIORS OR WHATEVER THAT HAVE NEVER HAD RATE RESTORATION WITH OR ARE FUNDING RESTORED FROM THE RECESSION. AND SO THE UNCERTAINTY THAT THIS KIND OF THIS CREATES HERE YOU HEARING FROM FROM ADVOCATES BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T THEY DON'T WANT THE RUG PULLED OUT FROM THEM IN A COUPLE OF YEARS THEY THEY WANT SOME CERTAINTY. I WAS WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER -- ON ON SATURDAY IN IN EUREKA AND WE HAD A HEARING TO HEAR FROM THE AYE DDS COMMUNITY. AND THERE ARE SOE PRETTY SICK THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE RATE STUDY. I THINK EVERYBODY ASSUMES THAT BECAUSE WE ARE IN A RURAL AREA SOMEHOW THAT'S LESS EXPENSIVE IT'S NOT. AND SO ONE OF MY PROVIDERS TELLS ME THIS RATE STUDY GOES THROUGH THE WAY IT IS HE'S GONNA LOSE THIS PROGRAM. SO THERE IS STILL SOME I STILL THINK THERE IS CONVERSATION NEEDS TO HAPPEN ABOUT THE RACE STUDY. BUT I GUESS MY POINT MY POINT HERE AND AND IS THAT THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT HERE WHO HAVE HAVE HAVE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND FUNDING. AND GOING FORWARD IN THIS. IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A CUTS CUTS THE MUSTARD QUITE FRANKLY. LET'S LET THE LA -- I THINK -- YEAH I WAS LOOKING AT ONE COME INTO THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING AND WHAT DIRECTOR PARCHMAN SAID -- THIS FEELS LIKE A RATE INCREASE NOT A RESTORATION OF RATES I MEAN THE THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE THE HALF DAY BILLING THE SUSPENSION OF SOCIAL RECKON CAMP SERVICES. THOSE A RECESSIONARY CUTS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN RESTORED -- AND THERE WAS A BIG GROUP YOU KNOW IT'S PRETTY SIZEABLE RATE INCREASE THAT OCCURRED IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN AT THE SAME TIME -- THIS PARTICULAR RATE INCREASE THIS PROPOSED THIS YEAR REALLY BUILDS UPON EVEN THOUGH IT'S INFORMED SOMEWHAT BY THE RATE STUDY IT REALLY BUILDS UPON THE CURRENT EXISTING RATE STRUCTURE THE RATE FRAMEWORK AND RATE SETTING METHODOLOGIES. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY IMPLEMENTING. THE RATE MODELS. FROM THE RATE STUDY I MEAN IF YOU WERE TO DO THAT AND RESIDENTIAL SERVICES IT WILL COST MORE LIKE SIX HUNDRED AND SOMETHING. MILLION GENERAL FUND. THIS IS A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR A PROPOSAL ACROSS A VARIETY OF SERVICES. SO IT'S IT'S NOT FULLY UTILIZING THE RATE STUDY BUT I I WOULD SAY IT'S A RATE. INCREASE BASED ON OUR UNDERSTANDING. BUT IT IT ITSELF BUT IT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S LEAVING OUT SOME CRITICAL COMPONENTS SOME SERVICES THAT. THAT THAT ARE RELIED UPON -- THAT ARE GETTING ANY ATTENTION. YEAH IT DEFINITELY TARGETS TARGETS THE FUNDING INCREASES. YEAH IT WOULD JUST I THINK I THINK YOU HEARD FROM THE ADVOCATES AND AND THAT THAT. THERE'S SOME THERE'S STILL SOME CONCERN. YOU'VE COME TO MISTER. THIS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WAS TRYING TO TAKE MY TURN ON THIS -- ONE I JUST WANT TO ECHO PRETTY MUCH WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID -- DIRECTOR BARMAN I'M I'M JUST GONNA ASK COMING WITH IT TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR PLUS SURPLUS. OR ARE YOU NOT ASKING FOR MORE FROM THE GOVERNOR I MEAN. HE HE YOU'VE HEARD WE WERE ALL PORTION FOR THE 8% WERE ALL PUSHING FOR MORE. AND WE KNOW THERE'S MORE MONEY THERE. SO FAR WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENED. BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY REALLY WANTS TO KNOW THAT. BECAUSE WE'RE LEAVING PROGRAMS OUT WE KNOW THE MONEY'S THERE. THEY ARE YOU JUST GETTING TOLD NO FROM THE GOVERNOR OR I MEAN HONESTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED. SO WITH THE PROPOSAL THAT WE% HAVE FORWARD WE YOU KNOW AS AS YEAR WHERE WE HAVE THE RIGHT STUDY THAT THAT HAD BEEN COMPLETED AND WE HAVE THE RIGHT MODELS AND AND WE'RE AT THE POINT RIGHT NOW WE'RE GETTING THE COMMENTS BACK. THERE'S SOME REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND THERE REALLY DOES NEED TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL. KIND OF CONVERSATIONS FROM A BROADER PERSPECTIVE ALSO ON THERE'S ONLY BEEN TWO RATE INCREASES IN LAST TWENTY YEARS SO [inaudible] WHAT? I MEAN WE WE CAN. GO OVER OKAY HERE'S HERE'S THE STUDY WHICH WE HAD ACTUALLY ASK YOU TO BRING BACK TO US AND MARCH WHICH HASN'T HAPPENED. WHEN IT WHEN YOU GUYS WERE SUPPOSED TO GO OVE THAT WITH US BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT HEARING? AND NOW IT'S BITS AND PIECES ITS SUNSETS. AND WE WE CAN GO INTO THE LOGIC OF THE CONVERSATION I I THINK WHAT EVERYBODY'S CONCERNED ABOUT. ESPECIALLY ALL THE ADVOCATES AND EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PROGRAMS BEING DROPPED OFF FOR THEIR LOVED ONES. IS [inaudible] WHY? IN THE WORLD. ARE WE NOT JUST INCREASING IT BACK TO WHAT IT IS. WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE IN HEALTH AND ON A CALL ON IT? TO ENSURE THAT OUR RACE TAKING CARE. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE MONEY. IF I IF I COULD AS WELL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT IN IN OUR ENTIRE. KIND OF SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE GROWTH THAT WE'RE HAVING. IN THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE SERVING BUT ALSO THE GROWTH AND I THINK THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. HAVE TAKEN A LOOK AT SOME REALLY IMPORTANT DECISIONS AS FAR AS THE FUNDING WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. THESE ARE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THIS SUMMER TO HAVE THIS BROADER DISCUSSION OF SAYING WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE INFLUENCING. REALLY LOOKING AT THE COMMENTS BACK WITHIN THE RATE STUDY TAKING A LOOK AT OUR REIMBURSEMENTS TAKING A LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS FROM THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE HAVE HAD A YEAR OVER YEAR. APPROVAL WITHIN OUR REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE SYSTEM IT'S A YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. FROM SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OR PROJECTED AT ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION I THINK IT'S WAS. TO MEET MAYBE A SLIGHTLY LESS THAN THAT FROM. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO NINETEEN TWENTY THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE CONTINUING TO GROW WITHIN OF OUR EXPENDITURES THAT'S GREATER THAN EVEN OUR CASE LOW GROWTH. I'M NOT MINIMIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT OUR COMMUNITY SAYING. BUT WHAT I AM SAYING IS WE NEED TO TAKE ALL OF THIS INFORMATION BACK HAVE A CONVERSATION. TAKE A LOOK IN OUR TOTALITY OF THE THINGS THAT ARE INFLUENCE IN OUR SYSTEM. SO WE CAN ALSO THEN HAVE SOME IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS AS TO WHAT WHAT WHAT IS KIND OF WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM AS FAR AS THE OVERSIGHT WHERE THE EXPENDITURES WHAT IS THE FUNDING WHEN IS THE REIMBURSEMENTS. AND THAT IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING THOSE CONVERSATIONS THIS SUMMER -- AND SO IN IN ORDER TO SAY WHERE THAT THE TARGETED AREAS THAT THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS THOSE PRIORITY AREAS IS WHAT WE PUT FORWARD IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. DIRECTOR WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT BUT FOR THE COMMUNITY IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. AND AS THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AND AND I AGREE WITH -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. WITH I I HOPE SOME OF THESE MEMBER PROPOSALS ARE UP. ON THE AGENDA FOR US TO VOTE ON BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF US SUPPORTED THAT. AND I HOPE AS WE GET INTO CONFERENCE. IN THOSE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS THAT WE CAN WORK SOME OF THESE THINGS OUT AND PUT SOME MORE FUNDING IN THERE. BECAUSE IT PRETTY SURE IT'S THE WILL OF THE LEGISLATURE TO GET THAT THERE. ARE AT LEAST A LARGE MAJORITY OF US -- BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THE FUNDING. SO I DO LOOK FOR TO THAT CONVERSATION. AND I KNOW YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL THE I'S ARE DOTTED IN THE TEASER CROSSED IN AND ALL OF THAT. IN. AS PRETTY GUIDE YOU PUSH HARDER WHEN THE TIME COMES BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THE MONEY AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN EXCUSE FOR ANYBODY. TO SIT BACK AND SAY HEY WE'VE GOT. OVER TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN SURPLUS. IN SORRY WE JUST COULDN'T DO IT THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION. BECAUSE I I DIRECTOR THAT'S NOT GONNA CUT IT FOR THESE FAMILIES THAT'S NOT GONNA CUT IT FOR THESE PROGRAMS THAT. ARE BARELY HANGING ON IT WE WE CAN'T GIVE ON THAT EXCUSE YOU YOU AND I HAVE HAD THAT CONVERSATION FOR THREE YEARS SEVERAL MEMBERS ON THIS. COMMITTEE HAVE HAD THAT CONVERSATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW. A TOP NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT WE HAVE THE ABILITY WE HAVE THE FUNDING. AND WE JUST NEED TO GET IT DONE TO TAKE CARE OF THESE PEOPLE THE RIGHT WAY. CHARLOTTE FOR TO THAT AND MADAM CHAIR I HOPE. THAT THOSE AGENDA ITEMS ARE ON THERE FOR US TO VOTE ON NEXT WEEK. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT -- WE'VE ALL HAVE HEARD FROM. MANY OF THE PEOPLE REGARDING THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF THE MAY REVISED. I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE -- AN UNDERSTATEMENT TO SAY THAT THERE'S OUTRAGE. AT THE FACT THAT THE 8%. AFTER THE RATE STUDY IS NOT BEING INCLUDED. AS MR MATHIS SAID SPENT. TWO THERE WERE ONLY BEEN TO RATE INCREASES. WHEN THIS MATTER WAS HEARD THE HEARING ON MARCH SIXTH? IT WAS PRESENTED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS JIM FRAZIER AND CHRIS HOLDEN. AND THEY TALKED ABOUT A DOWN PAYMENT. THEN THE CONVERSATIONS CAN CONTINUE. BUT IT WAS THE DOWN PAYMENT BASED UPON THE RATE STUDY TO DO THE 8% ACROSS THE BOARD. AND I QUOTE FROM FROM THEIR TESTIMONY WAS TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS IN COMMUNITY SERVICES. SUFFICIENTLY STABILIZE THE SYSTEM AND PROVIDE A SOLID FOUNDATION ON WHICH TO IMPLEMENT BROADER REFORMS. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A DOWN PAYMENT. THE THE THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOW LOOKING AT SUN SETTING IT. THE FACT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT INSTEAD OF STABILIZING IT. WE IN ESSENCE ARE DESTABILIZING IT. ALL OVER AGAIN. AND YOUR RIGHT DOCTOR WOULD IT IT ISN'T THAT THERE WAS -- THAT THERE WAS A REDUCTION IT'S JUST THAT THEY WERE SO LOW. THAT THERE WAS -- THE THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR CALIFORNIA HAS INCREASED MORE THAN 8% SO EVEN AT THE 8% EVENTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE AS YOU SAID WITH THOSE CONVERSATIONS. BUT IT'S STILL AN ISSUE THAT REQUIRES. REQUIRED AND REQUIRES. IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND I THINK IF WE HAVE A RATE STUDY. THE PROVIDES AT LEAST THE INFORMATION WE NEED FOR NOW FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THAT WE DO LOOK AT THAT. OKAY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ONGOING BENEFITS. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANS IT'S ON GOING. TO PUT A SUNSET ON IT. NECESSARILY STATES THIS IS NO LONGER AN ON GOING NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY WE KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THAT LEAST CAN AFFORD TO HAVE CONTINUED DESPITE DESTABILIZATION. THE QUESTION IS IT BECAUSE AT THAT POINT WE WOULD BE ROLLING BACK WE PUT A SUNSET WE'RE ROLLING BACK AGAIN. I I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE LA -- AND I I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HAVE YOU. ADDRESS EACH OF THE THE CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED BY THE LA L.. I MAY NEED SOME ASSISTANCE WITH WHAT THOSE WERE. A COUPLE OF MY DO I AM GOING TO AWARE OF ONE IS THERE IS A COMMENT ABOUT THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT WOULD TAKE GOING BACK TO THE FAIRVIEW. OR PORTED BILL WITH THE TEN INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD STAY AT PORTER VILLE INTEL WE HAVE THE COMMUNITY HOMES. YOU KNOW WHILE WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT IN OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP HOMES IN THE TIME FRAME WHEN I START TALKING ABOUT IN GENERAL OF DEVELOPING A COMMUNITY HOME. I'VE HAD A LOT LAST SEVERAL YEARS FOCUSED ON FOLKS MOVING FROM THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN DEVELOPING THAT COMMUNITY HOMES AND RECOGNIZING SOME OF THOSE DELAYS AND SO. I AM KIND OF IN THIS THIS PRACTICE OF SAYING THAT IT DOES TAKE THIS TIME PERIOD BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETIMES THE REST THAT HAPPENS. HOWEVER BASED ON THE LOCATION AND BASED ON Và HOUSING GROUPS THAT WOULD BE LOOKING AT DEVELOPING THOSE RESOURCES THAT I WOULD NOT ANTICIPATE DELAYS. AND THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT WITHIN THE TIME FRAME THAT WE WOULD ANTICIPATE -- AND THEN IF I CAN SO. CAN YOU HELP ME OUT A LITTLE BIT SO NOW ON THE THE WAY YOU DRESS. BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. ALL OF THE ALL OF THE COMMENTS ALL OF THE CONCERNS YOUR QUESTIONS. SO ON THE FUNDING PROPOSAL FOR A MODEST RELATIVE TO THE RATE STUDIES IDENTIFIED FUNDING GAPS -- TAKING A LOOK AT YOU KNOW AND I I GUESS ON ON SEVERAL OF THESE WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE THE SUNSET YOU KNOW WE'VE. YOU KNOW WHAT WE WHAT WE HEAR YOUR CONCERNS AND BASED ON THE OUT YOUR PROJECTIONS. YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE PROPOSAL AS FAR AS A LIMITED SCOPE BUT THE BENEFITS FOR THE FISCAL RELIEF. I GUESS I'M GOING TO JUST KIND OF TAKE A STEP BACK AND TALK THROUGH SOME OF THAT THE AREAS THAT WE DID FOCUS ON YOU KNOW AND WHILE YOU KNOW I I I ALWAYS APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK THAT THE LA -- DOES YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE PERSPECTIVES THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING TO US -- WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT BEING ABLE TO PRIORITIZE THE AREAS THAT WE DID IT DOES GET TO SOME OF THE AREAS THAT WE WERE INFORMED BY -- THE RATE MODELS THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL AND SAYING HOW DO WE NOT PERPETUATE. KIND OF THE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE HAD BETWEEN THE DIFFERENCES OF REGIONAL CENTERS AND PROVIDERS AND SO THE PROPOSAL THAT WE PUT FORWARD. AS FAR AS TAKING A LOOK AT THE TARGETED AREAS USING THE ALLOCATION -- THAT'S INFORMED BY THE RATE STUDIES DOES MOVED THAT NEEDLE INTO NOT HAVING KIND OF THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAY ONE REGIONAL CENTER IN ANOTHER REGIONAL CENTER THAT MAY HAVE HAD SET RATES. AT DIFFERENT. LEVELS SO I CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE IN PERSONAL ASSISTANT SOME -- REGIONAL CENTERS THAT HAVE A RATE THAT MAY BE AT FORTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR WE HAVE OTHERS THAT MAY BE AT THIRTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. THOSE ARE VERY DIFFERENT ISSUES AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH WHAT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE. THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO ADDRESS THOSE -- AS FAR AS TAKING A LOOK AT BEING ABLE TO THE CONCERNED THAT ELLIE -- HAS PRESENTED AS FAR AS DELAYING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MODELS ARE DOING A PILOT AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO DO THAT ONE OF THE AREAS THAT THAT. I HAD SAID IS THAT WE DO WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION THIS SUMMER IS TO IS BROADER CONVERSATION. AS FAR AS EVERYTHING THAT'S RELATED TO THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPACT IN OUR SYSTEM. AND THAT IS GOING TO INCLUDE THE COMMENTS THAT WERE GETTING BACK FROM THE COMMUNITY ON OUR RATE MODELS. IT'S INCLUDING KIND OF THE GROWTH IN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXPENDITURES IN OUR POPULATION GROWTH ARE REIMBURSEMENTS BUT THEN ALSO TAKEN A A TOTAL TOTAL LOOK INTO. KIND OF THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM ARE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY YOU'RE GONNA HEAR ON ISSUE SIX SOME OF THE AREAS THAT WERE WANTING TO TOUCH ON ON THOSE AREAS AS WELL. SO AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE TAKING THAT THE THE STEPS INTO SOME OF THE AREAS THAT WE SEE IS IS PRIORITY AREAS RECOGNIZING AGAIN THE GOOD WORK THAT THE LA ALWAYS DONE IN THEIR ANALYSIS -- BUT THESE ARE THE THE PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE FORWARD TODAY. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS -- THE TALKS DURING THE SUMMER. ARE WE THEN EXPECTING A PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNMENT DURING THE SUMMER FOR CLEAN UP LEGISLATION. WHAT'S THE PATH FORWARD FOR AFTER THOSE TALKS IN THE SUMMER SO. THAT YOU KNOW AS FAR AS WHAT I THINK THAT. THE DISCUSSIONS THIS SUMMER IS GOING TO INFORM US AS TO WHAT THOSE NEXT STEPS ARE YOU KNOW SO WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE WERE NOT JUST. I'M HAVING A BENEFIT OF A CONVERSATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF A CONVERSATION BUT THEY REALLY ARE MEANINGFUL WITH A FRAMEWORK AS TO WHAT WHAT IS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN I TALK ABOUT. REIMBURSEMENT SO IS THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF OUR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT SCISSOR OTHER WAYS BECAUSE I HAD SURE JUST A LITTLE BIT AGO THAT. YOU KNOW WE WE DO SEE THAT OUR OUR ANNUAL INCREASE WORK WE'RE SHOWING GROWTH AND I CONSUMER POPULATION BUT WE'RE ALSO SHOWING THAT OUR EXPENDITURE GROWTH IS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. YOU KNOW OVER THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OUR EXPENDITURE GROWTH AS COMPARED TO THE POPULATION IS VERY SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. YOU KNOW AND AND WE NEED TO REALLY ALSO HAVE FURTHER UNDERSTANDING INTO ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT PRESSURES SO WE CAN THOSE NEXT STEPS ARE. WE HAVE A RATE STUDY. THAT IS ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER THE SHELF LIFE OF THAT RATE STUDY. WELL THE WHEN. THE MODELS THEMSELF ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THE MODELS THAT ARE ACTUALLY THERE IS THAT IT IS A VERY -- TRANSPARENT YOU KNOW BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT THINGS OUT AND AND AGAIN LET ME KIND. TO GET INTO THE WEEDS A LITTLE BIT IS TO THE RIGHT MODELS IS THAT IN EACH OF THE RATE MODEL SO SAY FOR RESIDENTIAL IT BREAKS DOWN. SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF IT WHAT IS THE WAGES AND COMPENSATION WHAT IS THE COST OF KIND OF THE HOUSING WHAT IS THE COST OF TRAINING WHAT IS THE COST OF YOU KNOW THERE'S WORKER'S COMP THERE'S DIFFERENT PIECES THAT ARE BROKEN OUT SO YOU REALLY DO HAVE. ELEMENTS THAT SHOULD THERE BE A NEED FOR UPDATES FOR DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF IT IT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE UPDATED. SO WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE RATE MODELS THEMSELVES THE STRUCTURE OF THEM WERE DESIGNED TO BE ABLE TO HELP YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE AND EVERYTHING TO HAVE FUTURE CONVERSATIONS. YOU KNOW IF THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED OR EVEN WITH SAYING LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME ADDITIONAL -- CONVERSATIONS IT DOES LEND ITSELF TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ADJUSTMENTS IF THAT WAS NEEDED. BUT THE RATE STUDY WAS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED. TO MAKE THOSE RATE CHANGES NOW IT APPEARS. THE RATE STUDY WAS -- TO BE REPORTED TO THE LEGISLATURE AND IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR -- AND TO TO DETERMINE THAT WHAT THOSE KIND OF DELIBERATE OF DISCUSSIONS WOULD BE -- MOVING FORWARD AND SO WE WERE WE WERE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO LEGISLATURE THIS RATE STUDY CORRECT. ANOTHER COMING FROM THE LA -- WAS THAT. THE THE PROPOSAL. AND IF I MAY NOT HAVE TAKEN THE NOTES CORRECTLY BUT IT TREATS ONGOING SERVICES. AS IF THEY WERE TEMPORARY. BUT THEY ARE TEMPORARY AND AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO WHAT THE MEMBERS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE STATE DESTABILIZATION. OF THE DESTABILISATION PERIOD -- AND UNDERSTATES THE TRUE ON GOING COST. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT? THE FACT THAT THIS IS BEING TREATED AS IF IT WERE. TEMPORARY. BUT THESE COSTS ARE NOT TEMPORARY. SO AGAIN MADAM CHAIR I THE THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO HAVE A PROPOSAL THAT IS IS PUT FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE THE IMMEDIATE ISSUES. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONVERSATIONS THIS SUMMER I JUST I DON'T WANT TO TO MINIMIZE. THE VALUE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IN A TOTALITY. FROM LA -- WHAT WERE THE OTHER -- THE OTHER. TWO PROBLEMS THERE WERE FOUR PROBLEMS. THE DIRECTOR IS ADDRESSED -- THREE OF THOSE THE FINAL POINT WAS. THE FACT THAT THE PROPOSAL LIMITS THE SCOPE OF WHO BENEFITS FROM THE RATE INCREASES SO IT IT DOES PROVIDE. TARGETED FISCAL RELIEF TO SOME OF THE PROVIDERS THAT SORT OF EMERGED FROM THE FINDINGS OF THE RATE STUDY IS IN NEED OF OF RATE INCREASES BUT IT DOESN'T PROVIDE. ANY LEVEL OF FISCAL RELIEF TO THE OTHER PROVIDERS IN THE SYSTEM. NO WOULD YOU ADDRESS THAT CONCERN PLEASE. YES THANK YOU -- WITH HE TAKING A LOOK AT THE THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE WE AGAIN FOCUSED ON REALLY THAT THE PRIMARY AREAS THAT WE SAW INFORMED BY THE RATE STUDY THAT HAD. SIGNIFICANT -- KIND OF COST PRESSURES IF YOU WILL AS I HAD MENTIONED WITH THE RESIDENTIAL WE HAVE SEEN. SPECIFICALLY THOSE SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN DECLINING YEAR OVER YEAR -- AND THEN ALSO WITH THE AND I I CERTAINLY RESPECT THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SERVICES AND SERVICE MODELS THAT ARE IN ALIGNMENT AND THAT WILL BE IN COMPLIANCE AND CERTAINLY. JUST WITH THAT NEW FEDERAL ROLE WITH THE PROPOSAL OF SAYING THAT WE HAVE THE TARGETED AREAS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT ARE CONSISTENT IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE FEDERAL RULE DOESN'T MEAN THAT OTHERS WILL NOT BE -- BUT AT THIS TIME THESE ARE THE PROPOSALS THAT WE PUT FORWARD AS THE PRIORITIES AND AGAIN IT'S ADDRESSING THE RESIDENTIAL IT'S ADDRESSING THOSE PROPOSALS OR THOSE SERVICES THAT ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH EIGHT CBS -- AND THEN THE SUPPORT SERVICES THAT DO TOUCH THE NUMBER OF THE DIFFERENT SERVICE MODELS AS A SUPPLEMENTAL STAFFING -- AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT WITH THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SUSPENSION THAT THAT IS -- A PROPOSAL THAT DOES TOUCH THE NON RESIDENTIAL SERVICES. JUST ONE POINT ON THE ON THE HOLIDAY SCHEDULE THAT DOES AFFECT THE NON WE AGREE IT DOES AFFECT THE NON RESIDENTIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS BUT THE HOLIDAY SCHEDULE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED SINCE. TWENTY FIFTEEN SO TO CONTINUE THAT SUSPENSION DOESN'T DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS CURRENT WHAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT -- BUDGET YEAR. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. TO LIKE TO RESPOND. THAT'S BASED ON THE NUMBER OF OF DAYS THAT HAVE BEEN PROJECTED. I THINK THAT IS ACCURATE THAT MANY OF THOSE DAYS THAT ARE PROJECTED HOWEVER THERE'S NOT ALL OF THOSE SERVICE PROVIDERS I THINK MANY OF THEM. STILL MAY BE -- RECOGNIZING A NUMBER OF KIND OF THOSE HOLIDAYS OR OR DAYS OFF AND SO BEING ABLE TO PROPOSE THEN LOOKING AT HOW TO STANDARDIZE THAT THAT IS. KIND OF LIFTING THAT. GIVES THEM SOME ASSURANCE THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS HANGING OVER THEIR HEAD -- WHICH I THINK WE HAVE HEARD FROM OUR COMMUNITY THAT'S BEEN A GREAT CONCERN. WIRE THE FUNDS FOR THE STATE AND REGIONAL CENTERS ON GOING. SO THOSE ARE FUNDS THAT WE WOULD SEE THAT WOULD STILL PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT TO THE SYSTEM THAT WOULD NEED TO CONTINUE -- SO IN THE INSTANCE OF THE OVERSIGHT OF THE REGIONAL CENTER AS FAR AS THE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE INTO THE SYSTEM -- THAT WOULD BE AN AREA THAT WOULD NEED TO CONTINUE AND THEN ALSO WITH THE PROJECTION THAT WE HAVE THAT ALL TALK ALSO ON THE ISSUE SIX ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE SUPPORT A LIVING PROVIDERS AND A COUPLE OF THEM AS FAR AS A REQUIREMENT FOR BACKGROUND CHECK. THAT THE FUNDING THAT WE WOULD REQUEST FOR THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE TO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS -- TO DO THAT BACKGROUND CHECKS ON THOSE DIFFERENT SERVICE LINES THAT TO CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE THOSE REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU A QUESTION TO FINANCE WHY? WHY DID THE ADMINISTRATION SELECT THESE LAST TWO PROGRAMS ALL. THAT JAKE POOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO IT -- AS AS WAS YOU KNOW -- MENTIONED IN THE MAYOR VISION WE DO HAVE -- A REVENUE PROBLEM IN THE OUT YEARS THAT IS ONE FACTOR AND I THINK THE OTHER. FACTORS THAT THIS IS A A VERY -- FAST GROWING -- PROGRAM -- SIMILAR TO THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED -- IN THE MAY REVISION. AND I THINK WITH WHAT WHAT THIS GOVERNOR'S REALLY STRESSING THESE ARE PRIORITIES FOR HIM BUT WHAT HE HAS REALLY BEEN STRESSING IS. TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE OUR FISCAL HOUSE IN ORDER AND ARE ABLE TO WEATHER A RECESSION -- WHICH YOU KNOW. IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET BUT LIKELY IS COMING AT SOME POINT IN -- IN THE YOU KNOW NEAR FUTURE -- AND I THINK IT'S EVEN BEEN MENTIONED -- AS PART OF THEIR MAY REVISION OVERVIEW HE GAVE THAT I MEAN WE CALIFORNIA IS STANDS TO LOSE. IT COULD BE UP TO SIXTY BILLION IN IN REVENUES -- DURING A RECESSION SO. HE WANTS TO CONTINUE WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A A ROBUST RESERVE FOR EMERGENCIES AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE -- YOU KNOW WHAT THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE WE'VE WE'VE HAD -- TO PULL BACK -- ON PERMANENCY -- WE'RE HOPING IN THE FUTURE THAT THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE TO GO DOWN THIS PATH BUT AT THIS POINT -- THESE THESE SEVERAL PROGRAMS WHERE WE'VE -- PROPOSED THAT THE SUNSET -- YOU KNOW THERE THE IT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE TWO ISSUES ONE IS THE REVENUES AND ONE IS HOW CAN WE WORK START CONTAINING COSTS IN THESE PROGRAMS. SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE -- TO THE PROGRAMS BUT AT A AT A HIGHER QUALITY BUT WITH MORE COUNT ABILITY. THE THE THE FOR STATEMENT THAT YOU MADE WAS RIPPED THERE'S A REVENUE PROBLEM IN OUT YEARS. IT'S CLEAR THAT IF WE DO HAVE REVENUE PROBLEMS IN OUT YEARS THERE WILL HAVE TO BE ADJUSTMENTS JUST LIKE THERE WERE IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN NOT JUST ON THIS PROGRAM BUT ON SO MANY PROGRAMS. THE NEED IS NOW. AND THE NEED FOR THE NEED FOR THE FUNDING IS NOW ON THE NEED FOR THE STABILIZATION IS NOW -- SO THE THE THE THE FACT THAT THAT THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT REVENUE IN OUT YEARS -- I'M SORRY IT MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I'M NEW HERE. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. DOCTOR WOULD MAKE THAT COMMENT THAT -- THAT WE'RE WE'RE IN WE'VE GOT THE SURPLUS WE BELIEVE THERE THERE WITH THIS IS THE TIME IF WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. TO SHOW WHAT CALIFORNIA IS ALL ABOUT. WE DO TAKE CARE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE WE DO TAKE CARE OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT IS THAT HAS DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WE TAKE CARE OF THE COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN WAITING. FOR YEARS. FOR US TO BE IN THE POSITION WE'RE IN NOW. THAT'S WHAT CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT AND SO WHEN WHEN I GET THE THE THE THE THE LETTERS AND THE EMAILS AND THE CALLS. ABOUT THE OUTRAGE SPECIFICALLY ON THIS. I'VE GOT TO TELL THE COMMUNITY. I AGREE WITH YOU. I'M OUTRAGE. TO BECAUSE THIS IS THE TIME IF THERE'S EVER A TIME THIS IS THE TIME TO FIND A WAY TO TAKE CARE OF THE COMMUNITY. THAT AS I SAID AS BEEN WAITING A LONG LONG TIME. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT REVENUE PROBLEMS IN THE OUT YEARS ARE THERE -- IT'S VERY SPECIFICALLY THESE THESE ARE THE TWO PROGRAMS THAT YOU FEEL THAT. NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE SUNSET OR IS THERE GOING TO BE AN EVALUATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO REMOVE THE SUNSET. I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS -- AN EVALUATION PROCESS ON GOING -- AT THIS TIME THIS IS THIS IS THE PROPOSAL I WILL SAY THAT WE ARE I MEAN THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSINGINCREASES. AT THIS TIME -- SO. YOU KNOW IT IT IT REALLY COMES BACK TO WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO BUDGET. FOR YOU KNOW A FIVE YEAR PERIOD CURRENT YEAR THROUGH BUDGET YEAR PLUS -- THREE SO -- YOU KNOW THE OUTLOOK IS NOT GOOD IN THOSE YEARS OF COURSE AS AS WE GET CLOSER WE WILL NEED TO SEE. I MEAN WILL HAVE REVENUE UPDATES WILL HAVE YOU KNOW THE PROJECTIONS WILL CHANGE AND THAT WILL TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE. I MEAN THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE WE CAN SAY NOW THAT WE CAN AFFORD THESE INCREASES FOR YOU KNOW. TWO FULL YEARS AND AFTER THAT WE CAN'T AND THERE'S A LOT I'M SURE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF OTHER. YOU KNOW PROGRAMS THAT WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT IF WE DO RUN INTO A RECESSION -- YOU KNOW. WELL I I I THINK THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE BEEN WE STRIVE TOWARDS IS. YOU KNOW WE WOULD WE WOULD RATHER BE UP FRONT NOW THAT THAT -- REDUCTIONS MAY BE MAY BE COMING RATHER THAN HAVING TO TURN AROUND AND MAKE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS. IN IN FUTURE YEARS WHICH STILL MAIN HAVE TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD. YEAH I I GUESS I AM I I GUESS I CONCEPT OF SUNSET -- UP THERE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS GOING FORWARD THERE I THINK PART OF THE ANGST FOR ME IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE SAYING. THAT THESE ARE GOING TO SUNSET SO YOU ARE CREATING UNCERTAINTY. WE JUST SAW. SIXTEEN POSITIONS THAT WERE ASKED FOR BY THE ADMINISTRATION -- FOR SUPPORT FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN HURT SIR SERVICES AGENCY. ARE WE TELLING THOSE NEW SIXTEEN EMPLOYEES THAT YOUR JOB MAY SUNSET. I'M I'M YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REVENUE IS GOING TO BE BUT YET WE'RE TELLING OTHER PROVIDERS OUT HERE THAT THIS THIS MAY THIS MAY SENSE I DO YOU DO YOU SEE WHAT THAT. UNCERTAINTY CON BECAUSE I I I I SEE I SEE YOUR POINT -- DEFINITELY I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THESE ARE AGAIN AREAS PROGRAMS THAT ARE GROWING EXPONENTIALLY. AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK ANYBODY AT THE TABLE AT LEAST WOULD DISAGREE THAT THAT THIS IS THIS PROGRAM PLACES NEVER CAN'T PRESSURE ON ON THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND NOT TO SAY THAT THAT IS NO WAY -- INTENDED TO MEAN THAT IT'S NOT AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT THIS IS. A VERY GOOD PROGRAM THAT DOES LOTS OF YOU KNOW HELPS LOTS OF PEOPLE BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IS THAT WE WE HAVE TO LIVE WITHIN. THAT THE REVENUE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE AT THIS POINT. I'M NOT DISAGREEING WITH YOU THAT WE WILL YOU KNOW THINGS WILL CHANGE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS AT THIS POINT IN TIME THIS THIS IS WHAT OUR PICTURE LOOKS LIKE? AND THAT IS WHY YOU SEE THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU AND WHY IS WHY IT IS SUNSET. AND COULD I ASK JUST ONE QUESTION FOR QUICK. THROUGH THE CHAIR. HOW MANY OTHER PROGRAMS -- HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE HOW MANY OTHER PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN GIVEN RATE INCREASES THAT HAVE SUNSETS. HOW MANY OTHER PROGRAMS STATEWIDE? IS THE FIRST I'VE HEARD THIS SO SO I I'M I'M JUST EITHER GIVE A RATE INCREASE OR YOU DON'T -- YOU GIVE A RATE INCREASE YOU KNOW THAT THE BUDGET MAY TAKE IT AWAY AT SOME POINT. BUT ARE THERE OTHER PROGRAMS OUT THERE WHERE THERE ARE SUNSETS AND PLEASE. AND AND AND I DON'T KNOW I'M JUST ASKING THE QUESTION. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD JOHN DOYLE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. UP WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WE HAVE THE BRIDGE FUNDING THERE IS A ONE YEAR RATE INCREASE AND THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS PROVIDED. FOR BOB AND I'M ASKING AND AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT -- BUT I'M ASKING SYSTEM WIDE. OUT THERE HOW MANY TIMES DO WE DO PROVIDER INCREASES. THAT SUNSET. I I MEAN I CAN'T ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN TERMS OF SO I'VE NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE I JUST SAT ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR THREE YEARS. I'VE NEVER HEARD THIS BEFORE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A RATE INCREASE THAT WOULD SUNSET DR WITH THIS IS OUR FOURTH YEAR FOURTH VEHICLE WHAT OKAY. IT SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE LONGER. BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW I MEAN. BECAUSE THERE YOU'RE CREATING INSTABILITY THROUGH THE MESSAGING. YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING. TO IT WILL BE OUT THERE FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND WE WE MIGHT APPEAL THE FORTIS WAS GOING TO SUNSET YOUR AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGHT AGAIN TO GET IT BACK -- AND AND I JUST. SO I'M JUST ASKING HOW MANY OTHER PROGRAMS ARE GIVEN A RATE INCREASE. WITH THE SUNSET BECAUSE I'VE NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE. I MISSED IT YOU KNOW MY APOLOGIES MAYBE THEY'LL HAVE CONTENT YES YES DOCTOR WITH MARTIN WITH THE LA OUT. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME EXAMPLES OF ACTUALLY FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS RATE INCREASES THAT ARE ARE LIMITED TERM A TEMPORARY IN IT KEY EXAM FOR THE PROPOSITION -- FIFTY SIX INCREASES BUT IMPART -- WITH PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX YOU COULD LOOK AT THOSE WERE SOMEWHAT PILOTING AND LOOKING AT THE BALLOT INITIATIVE AND YES ABOUT BALLOT INITIATIVE CRACKED AND CASES WHERE THERE REALLY WAS UP PROP SO POLICY REASON TO MAKE THEM LIMITED TERM IN ORDER. TO ASSESS THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND WHETHER THE THE RATES WERE TARGETING SORT OF THE APPROPRIATE TO PROVIDERS AND AND WHETHER ACCESS WAS BEING IMPROVED. BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH NOW AND THIS IS A THIS WILL BE A A MAJOR QUICK. ISSUE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THIS ISSUE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IN TERMS OF A SUNSET WILL COME UP THREE ADDITIONAL TIMES FOR THIS COMMITTEE -- WITH ME REVISION -- IT WILL COME UP ON THE ISSUE OF THE RESTORATION OF THE 7% -- SERVICE HOURS AND I JUST ASK THAT WILL BE SUNSET IT WILL COME UP -- IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY MEDI CAL PROVIDER RATE -- IN PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX THE PROPOSAL IS TO ESSENTIALLY THE GENERAL FUND WILL BE THE FULL BENEFITS FOR YOUR PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX REVENUES AFTER. TWENTY TWENTY ONE YOU'LL COME UP -- AGAIN IN THE HI THE HEALTH INSURANCE THIS SUBSIDY IS COVERED CALIFORNIA THE AFTER TWENTY TWENTY TO THE PENALTY REVENUES WILL CONTINUE BUT THE THE SUBSIDIES WILL AND AND THERE IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE SO THIS IS. SOMETHING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER REALLY IS -- IS THERE -- IT IS TO STABILIZE THINGS SERVE IN THESE CASES WHEN WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH IS ESSENTIALLY AN EXISTING POLICY COMMITMENT THAT'S ONGOING I THINK IN THE CASE OF DDS YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE SYSTEM THAT. YOU'RE TRYING TO MAINTAIN -- NOT INITIALLY SIR TO CREATE NEW PROGRAMS AND AND GROW SO -- IT IS TRUE IS FINANCE MENTIONED ACCORDING TO THEIR PROJECTIONS IN THE IN THE OUT YEARS THERE WILL BE -- REVENUE -- IN BALANCE AND IT AND NEED TO ADJUST THE BUDGET BUT WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT -- THAT -- CREATING THROUGH THE SUN SETS FOR HHS PROGRAMS THAT ARE REALLY EXISTING ONGOING POLICY COMMITMENTS IS. IS -- PROBABLY NOT THE NOT THE PLACE -- TO TO ADDRESS OUR TO THE FISCAL MANAGEMENT OF THE BUDGET STRUCTURE IS AS A WHOLE SO WE WILL IT'S IT'S A TOUGH CHALLENGING ISSUE BUT AS AN OFFICE WE REALLY WANT OF ASSISTANT AND AND HELP YOU SORT OF THROUGH THIS. REALLY QUITE A A CHALLENGING SORT OF OVERALL BUDGET ISSUE BUT BUT HAPPY TO HELP OUT. THANK YOU I THINK THAT THE QUESTION IS A FAIR QUESTION AND I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU'RE CAUGHT OFF GUARD AND TRY TO COME UP WITH AN ANSWER. I THINK IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. SO I WOULD ASK THE DEAD YOU PROVIDING THE ANSWERS TO ANY OTHER. DEPARTMENTAL -- INCREASE. THAT HOUSE A SUNSET THAT IS THAT WE'RE THIS IS HAPPENED IN THE PAST -- WE RECOGNIZE AND WILL BE DEALING WITH THE OTHER ISSUES -- AS IT HAS BEEN NOTED WILL. HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS SHORTLY BUT AS TO THE PAST I THINK IT'S A FAIR QUESTION AND I THINK FOR US AND HOPEFULLY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO TO LOOK AT HOW THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. IS IS BEING ADDRESSED. SO CAN WE GET THAT. IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS A WEEK WE WILL WE WILL LOOK INTO IT I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF PROPOSING INCREASES THAT THEN SUNSET -- BUT THERE HAVE BEEN RATE -- REDUCTIONS -- IN THE PAST -- YOU KNOW IN A ACROSS SEVERAL PROGRAMS -- IN ON THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES -- WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AREA SO I THINK THAT THE THE DIFFERENCE NOW IS THAT WE ARE WE ARE ACTUALLY PROJECTING -- A DECLINE IN REVENUES THAT WE WEREN'T PROJECTING -- IN BACK IN THE JANUARY BUDGET AND THAT HAS IS WHAT IS -- SORT OF WHY WE'VE HAD TO PAY FOR IT -- TO TO YOU KNOW LIVE WITHIN THOSE -- LIVE WITHIN THE REVENUES THAT. WE'RE PROJECTING WILL BE AVAILABLE DURING THOSE LATER YEARS I THINK. I THINK THAT IT IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT IT MAY SET A PRECEDENT. AND WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT OUR BUDGET. THAT. IF WE ARE IN THE IN. GOOD TIMES. THAT THE BUDGET REFLECT. THAT WE ARE IN IN THE SURPLUS -- AS OPPOSED TO BEING A SURPLUS WE TALK ABOUT. CUTS WHENEVER THE THE SURPLUS WHEN WE DO THAT WE HAVE NO SURPLUS OR THE THE REVENUES ARE DOWN -- BUT WHEN REVENUES ARE UP AND WE HAVE A SURPLUS. IF DURING THAT TIME. IN OUR HISTORY WE ARE. PUTTING SUNSETS -- IT WE ARE DEFINITELY SETTING A PRECEDENT AND I THINK THAT -- IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE GIVEN MUCH MORE TENSION [inaudible] THEN -- THEN OTHERWISE SO IF IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS IF YOU COULD -- GET BACK TO STEPS SO SHE COULD THEN LET US KNOW LET THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE KNOWS WITH THE RESPONSES. I APPRECIATE THAT WHAT WE WILL DO THAT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT TO ANYTHING ELSE FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD SEEING NOTHING FURTHER I DO THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. AND WE WILL HOLD THESE ITEMS OPEN. ALL RIGHT LET'S. TAKE ISSUE. SIX TRAILER BILL PROPOSALS WELCOME BACK. HAVE LEVY HERE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. NANCY BIRDMAN DIRECTOR DDS SO THE FOR ITEMS HERE I'LL GO AHEAD AND AND REVIEW THEM UNDER -- ISSUE SIX THE FIRST ONE IS TRAILER BILL FOR THE ENHANCE BE HERO SUPPORTS HOMES. THE ENHANCED BE HERO SUPPORTS HOMES IS A NEW MODEL THAT WAS DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT THE CLOSURE AT THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH COMPLEX NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY -- IT WAS A NEW MODEL AND AT THE TIME IT WAS SET UP AS A PILOT LIMITED -- TO AND WAS PART OF A SUNSET -- TO AS FAR AS MOVING FORWARD OUR REQUEST IS ACTUALLY ASKING JUST FOR AN EXTENSION FOR ONE YEAR -- TO CONTINUE -- IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATION OF THE HOMES -- AND THEY'LL GIVE US AN ADDITIONAL YEAR TO PROVIDE SOME ANALYSIS TO THE SUCCESS OF THE HOMES -- THEY HAVE ACTUALLY PROVEN TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL HOWEVER WE HAVE OF ALL THE APPROVED HOMES THAT WE HAVE -- WITHIN OUR DEVELOPMENT PLAN OWN LESS THAN HALF OF THEM ARE IN OPERATION AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE AN OPERATION -- THE SECOND ITEM IS FOR CANYON SPRINGS ADMISSION THIS IS AN EXPANSION TO THE COMMISSION AND TAKE CANYON SPRINGS -- THIS WE WOULD SEE AS IS KIND OF THE EXCEPTION -- TO ANY ROLE SO TO SPEAK -- WE HAVE CONTINUED AS WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS AND TO THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR SAFETY NET. IN SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH VERY VERY COMPLEX NEEDS -- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF RESOURCES SO TO SPEAK IN OUR TOOL CHEST SO TO TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS -- BUT AS WERE DEVELOPED BEING TO THE RESOURCES AND AS THEIR BECOMING OPERATIONAL -- WE STILL HAVE TIME THAT THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FURTHER -- DEFINE WHAT THOSE KIND OF GAPS ARE ONE OF THE AREAS IS KIND OF THIS OPTION OF WERE IN INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO HAVE LONGER TERM THERAPEUTIC SUPPORT SAID IS BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE WITHIN OUR CURRENT -- A CUTE -- CRISIS HOMES THAT IS STATE OPERATED THEIR LIMITED TO THIRTEEN MONTHS -- BUT WE ALSO HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY BE AN ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC SETTINGS AND SO WHAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES IS REQUESTING THE ABILITY TO ADMIT INTOOUR COMMUNITYSTATE OPERATED ON CANYON SPRINGS -- BUT WE ARE NOT REQUESTING -- ADDITIONAL CAPACITY -- WERE WERE PROPOSING TO DO THIS WITHIN OUR EXISTING CAPACITY -- AND ONLY FOR A VERY VERY SMALL GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS AND VERY UNIQUE SITUATIONS -- THE THIRD ITEM IS GOES ALONG WITH WHAT WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AN ISSUE FIVE REGARDING THE EARLY START CO PAYMENTS AS WE GIVE US THE AUTHORITY TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE THAT CHANGE. AND THEN THE FOURTH ITEM IS THE REGIONAL CENTER ACCOUNTABILITY OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING AND SO IS WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT FURTHER IN OUR EFFORTS AND THE REGIONAL CENTER OVERSIGHT -- ACCOUNTABILITY AND MONITORING WE WOULD BE -- PROPOSING. ESSENTIALLY TWELVE DIFFERENT ITEMS TWO OF THE ITEMS WOULD BE RELATED TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE ADJUSTMENT ONE WOULD BE GIVING US THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THEIR THE ASSOCIATED RATES -- CHANGES THE OTHER WOULD GIVE US THE AUTHORITY TO DO -- REGULATIONS ON THE OTHER ITEMS ARE REALLY KIND OF BROKEN UP INTO THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES ONE IS MONITORING PERFORMANCE OF REGIONAL CENTERS YEAH THERE IS BOARD GOVERNANCE AND THEN THE OTHER WAS REALLY IS RELATED TO CONSUMERS -- SAFETY AND TRANSPARENCY SO JUST QUICKLY KIND OF GO THROUGH THEM FOR YOU IS -- TO THE CONCEPTS OF WHAT WE WOULD SEE -- THAT WOULD BE -- INCLUDED IN EACH OF THESE AREAS FOR MONITORING THE PERFORMANCE ON THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE -- WHAT'S CALLED A PERFORMANCE CONTRACT REQUIREMENT THAT WAS -- START IN -- NINETEEN NINETY THREE BUT WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE CONTRACT WE DO SEE -- THAT AS I'VE TALKED ABOUT WITH OUR REORGANIZATION THAT WE'RE DOING WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO DOING ASSOCIATED UPDATING OF THOSE PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS BUT THAT WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS REQUIRE THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO BE -- ENGAGED MORE IN THIS PROCESS SO WE WOULD -- HAVE INCLUDED IN LANGUAGE THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD HAVE TO ANNUAL REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT -- AS TO THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND THEN WHAT ARE THE ACTION ITEMS THAT THEY'RE DOING. TO ENHANCE OR IMPROVE IN THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY'RE NOT MEETING THE TARGET AND THE MEASURES. THE NEXT ITEM WOULD BE THE REGIONAL CENTER PROCESS OF TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CROSSED REGIONAL CENTERS AND STANDARDIZE PRACTICES -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR COMMUNITY IS THAT WHEN YOU GO TO ONE REGIONAL CENTER YOU MAY NOT ALWAYS GET THE SAME EXPERIENCE WITH ANOTHER REGIONAL CENTER. ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE'VE REALLY LOOKED AT PRETTY STRONGLY IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS EXPRESSLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE JUST NEW TO THE SYSTEM OF HAVING. REALLY KIND OF A A STANDARD INFORMATION IF YOU WILL THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT ACROSS THIS DATE SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS -- WOULD -- HAVE THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS WOULD HAVE A STANDARDIZED PACKET THAT WOULD BE INFORMATIVE TO WHOEVER IT IS IT IS SEEKING SERVICES FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER -- AND THAT STANDARD PACKET WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON BOTH WITH AN EARLY START AND THEN ALSO OUR LETTERMAN SERVICES I'M SO AGAIN WE WOULD -- HAD ADDITIONAL DETAIL THAT WOULD GO INTO LANGUAGE IN REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS AVAILABLE IN IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. AND AGAIN CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE NEXT AYE BUT ITEM IS PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS -- THAT WHAT WE WOULD DO IS THE DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE THAT MACHINE READ READABLE -- SO ITEMS THAT WOULD BE A PART OF OUR DASHBOARD THAT IT WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE AND READABLE TO THOSE THAT ARE ACCESSING IT. THE OTHER IS THAT WE WOULD REQUIRE REGIONAL CENTERS TO ALSO POST ON THEIR WEBSITE -- THE ITEMS THAT ARE ON THE DEPARTMENT'S DASHBOARD SO IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE WHENEVER ANYBODY IN THEIR COMMUNITY IS LOOKING FOR INFORMATION THAT TALKS TO ANY OF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND TRANSPARENCY. THAT THE COMMUNITY IS SEEN WHAT IS AVAILABLE FOR THEIR REGIONAL CENTER AND THEN A LINK TO THE STATE TO THE DEPARTMENT. SO THERE CAN BE A COMPARISON TO OTHER REGIONAL CENTERS. ON THE MOVING TO BOARD GOVERNANCE WE WOULD BE EXPANDING THEN THE RICK -- IMPORT GOVERNMENT'S. GOVERNANCE'S BOARD MEETINGS WITH THE DEPARTMENT THAT UPON THE REQUEST OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT THE BOARD WOULD. MEET WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE DIRECTOR IS THAT IF IN THE EVENT THAT WE NEED TO MEET WITH THE BOARD WITHOUT IN ANY EMPLOYEES AT THE REGIONAL CENTER THAT THAT WOULD BE. AVAILABLE TO US AND WE COULD -- COORDINATE THAT. THE OTHER IS THE BOARD EXPERTISE -- EXPANDING THE BOARD EXPERTISE TO INCLUDE A FINANCIAL -- EXPERT ON THE BOARD RIGHT NOW THAT THAT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT SO WE WOULD NOT BE LOOKING -- TO CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE RELATED TO THAT WE WOULD HOWEVER PROVIDE THE OPTION FOR THE BOARDS -- TO HAVE SOMEBODY AT THAT HAS EXPERTISE IN BOARD GOVERNANCE -- IN ADDITION -- TO WITH MANAGEMENT SO THEY COULD CHOOSE BETWEEN MANAGEMENT BOARD GOVERNANCE SO WE WERE JUST LOOK TO KIND OF PROFESSIONAL LICENSE CHANGE THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE AREAS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD ENHANCE ON THE BOARD GOVERNANCE -- LEGAL COUNSEL CONFLICT OF INTEREST CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS THAT THIS WOULD CLARIFY AS FAR AS THE LEGAL REPRESENTATION OF THE BOARD THAT THAT WOULD BE INDEPENDENT OF AN EMPLOYEE -- OF THEIR REGIONAL CENTER AND SO IT COULD GOES IN ALIGNMENT WITH OUR CURRENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT THE BOARD ANYBODY THAT'S ON THE BOARD DOESN'T HAVE ANY -- FIDUCIARY BENEFIT YOU KNOW IN ANY RELATIONSHIP SO WE WOULD EXTEND THATTHEN AND SAYING THAT THE LEGAL COUNSEL TO THE BOARD THEN WOULD ALSO HAVE -- TO HAVE SOME -- CONFLICT FREE -- RELATIONSHIP AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE THAT AND NOT HAVING -- BE AN EMPLOYEE OF THE REGIONAL CENTER. THE LAST -- FEW ITEMS AS WITH CONSUMER SAFETY AND TRANSPARENCY WITH KIM CONSUMER SAFETY HADN'T MENTIONED THAT -- EARLIER IS THAT WE WOULD SEE TO HAVE WITHIN SOME OF OUR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT LICENSED ENTITIES ARE FAMILY HOME AGENCIES THERE'S NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR A BACKGROUND CHECK. SO FOR THOSE -- AREAS THAT WE HAVE TARGETED FOR THE RATE ADJUSTMENT -- WHILE WE ARE FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT MOST OF THEM ARE HAVING THEIR STAFF -- AT A HAVE BACKGROUND CHECKS WE DO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT PART OF THE REQUIREMENT SO FOR THESE -- AREAS THAT DO NOT HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT WE WOULD BE PROPOSING THAT AND THAT THERE WOULD BE AT BACKGROUND CLEARANCE -- REQUIREMENTS AND A DATE SET FORTH IN THE FUTURE -- HEALTH AND SAFETY THAT IT WOULD GIVE THE DIRECTOR AUTHORITY. TO REQUIRE THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO TAKE ACTION FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF INDIVIDUALS THAT AGAIN WOULD BE MORE OF A STATE WIDE. ON THIS DOES TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT HELPS US WITH COMPLIANCE WITH OUR FEDERAL -- REQUIREMENTS -- TO COMPLY WITH RESPONDING AS A STATE TO ANY ISSUES THAT MAY BE -- PRESSURES RELATED TO SPECIAL INCIDENTS ARE ACTIONS -- THAT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH DELIVERING OF SERVICES FOR THOSE UNDER OUR A FEDERAL WAIVER PROGRAM -- THAN SERVICE PROVIDER QUALITY THAT FOR IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE THE REGIONAL CENTER HAS A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WITH -- WITH THE PROVIDER THAT THOSE WOULD BE SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT -- WERE PART OF OUR REORGANIZATION HAS A RISK MANAGEMENT QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND SO AS WERE REALLY DOING OUR FULL ASSESSMENT TAKING A LOOK AT A RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN. WE WOULD WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE KIND OF FULL VISIBILITY INTO WHAT ARE THE AREAS OF COMPLIANCE OR NON COMPLIANCE IF YOU WILL -- SO WE CAN HELP TAKE A LOOK AT KIND OF STATEWIDE -- STANDARDS THAT IF THERE'S A NEED FOR TRAINING OR ANYTHING THAT THIS WOULD HELP INFORM US. THE LAST ITEM IS OUR NATIONAL CORE INDICATORS ON THIS IS THE MEASURE THAT WE USE THAT HELPS INFORM US ON INDIVIDUAL SATISFACTION OF SERVICES. THAT WE WOULD BE BROADENING THE REQUIREMENT FOR REGIONAL CENTERS -- TO HAVE THIS POSTED ON THE WEAR ON THEIR WEBSITE -- SO THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THEIR COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS AS WELL SO THOSE ARE THE THE ITEMS THAT WOULD BE A PART OF THE REGIONAL CENTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. AND I WOULD SAY THAT PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS THIS SUMMER WOULD BE INCLUDING YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE AREAS. THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO I'M KIND OF THE CONSISTENCY AND OVERSIGHT OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS -- THAT WOULD -- BE PART OF OUR OUR COULD A BROADER DISCUSSION AS WELL [inaudible] THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE [inaudible] SORRY. OKAY OKAY SO ANY PARTICULAR -- SORRY ABOUT THAT -- WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING -- THESE PROPOSALS IN PARTICULAR THE CANYON SPRINGS EXPANSION AND THE THE LAST ONE ON REGIONAL CENTER ACCOUNTABILITY OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING -- SO WE MAY HAVE SOME COMMENTS OVER THE COMING DAYS ON THOSE -- I WOULD NOTE ON THE LAST ITEM -- WE JUST RECEIVED THE FACT SHEET THIS AFTERNOON SO WE'RE STILL TRYING TO GO SORT THROUGH THOSE DETAILS. A LOT OF GOOD -- THERE'S A MAYOR THERE'S MERIT IN A LOT OF THE POINTS RAISED IN THAT IN THAT FINAL PIECE OF TRAILER BILL -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEPARTMENTS OVERSIGHT ROLE? WE JUST HAVE TO INITIAL CONCERNS BASED ON A PRELIMINARY A REVIEW. OF THE FACT SHEET -- AND IT'S PRIMARILY TO DO WITH THE FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH -- THAT PROPOSAL SO FIRST -- AS YOU NOTED IN THE LAST -- ISSUE IN THE IT ON THE AGENDA -- THERE I FUNDING FOR BECAUSE SOME OF THE TASKS THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED BY THE FOUR POSITIONS FUNDED IT DE DDS CONCERN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVIDER. RATE THAT WILL THEN SUNSET SO. IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHY ALL OF THE FUNDING NEEDS TO BE ON GOING I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE FUNDING SHOULD BE ON GOING TO DO SOME OF THESE OVERSIGHT TASKS BUT IF THE RATES TRULY WERE A TEMPORARY. A RATE THAT SUNSETS THEN WHY WOULD THEY NEED ADDITIONAL -- POSITIONS TO HANDLE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE RATES IT'S SORT OF A RHETORICAL QUESTION. AND THE SECOND POINT -- REGARDING THE FOUR POSITIONS FOR DDS WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT REQUESTED FIFTY FOUR NEW POSITIONS IN ITS JANUARY PROPOSAL TO RE ORGANIZE THE DEPARTMENT AND ABOUT TWENTY FIVE OF THOSE WOULD. DEAL WITH ISSUES RELATED TO REGIONAL CENTER OVERSIGHT AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OUR OFFICE WILL BE DOING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. IS TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT WAS. HOST OF THOSE POSITIONS IN JANUARY VERSES WHAT'S PROPOSED IN THIS CURRENT -- TRAILER BILL TO SEE IF THERE'S OVERLAP AND WHY THE DEPARTMENT WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL POSITIONS TO DO -- TO DO THIS OVERSIGHT WORK AND WHY THOSE TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED COULDN'T HANDLE IT [inaudible] THANK YOU. SYMBOLIC PART IN A FINANCE -- SO I JUST KNOW THAT -- THERE WAS WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING THE SPECIAL SESSION RATES ARE THE SAME WOULD BE TRUE FOR EMPLOYMENT IN THE PROPOSAL MENTAL RATE INCREASES. IN TERMS OF THE ONGOING NATURE OF THE RESOURCES ON THE DEPARTMENT IS EMBARKING ON REFORM EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN REGIONAL REGIONAL CENTER TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND ALSO IMPLEMENT BROADER FORMS -- AS WILL BE IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT THIS SUMMER. SO THIS WORKLOAD WAS NOT ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED -- IN THE HEADQUARTERS PC PS PROPOSED IN THE FALL -- SO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WOULD BE NECESSARY. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE [inaudible] WE'RE DONE. LET'S GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF RICKROLLING TRIPS IN ARKANSAS SHE SHE REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES ON THE ITEM -- REGIONAL CENTER ACCOUNTABILITY OVERSIGHT MONITORING WE WANTED OF ONCE AGAIN -- RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE -- THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCREASED OST -- AND SO MANY UNFUNDED -- MANDATES ON REGIONAL CENTERS IN THIS CASE WE'RE FUNDING IS COMING WITH THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS AND WE APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR KERR CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA ON THE CANYON SPRINGS PROPOSAL WE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THAT WAS A PROVISION THAT HAD BEEN. I THINK SIGNIFICANTLY NEGOTIATED LAST YEAR AND AND NOW WE THINK THIS IS A RETREAT FROM -- THAT -- NEGOTIATION AND AND AGAIN OPENING UP ON LIMITED -- ADMISSIBILITY WE DID RAISE THAT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OVER THE WEEKEND AND HAVE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS AND WE'RE HOPEFUL WE CAN CONTINUE THOSE -- DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK THROUGH THAT -- PROPOSED TO BE OUT. THANK YOU AND YOU ARE CORRECT -- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MIKE PEREIRA -- I'M A SERVICE PROVIDER IN BERKELEY CALIFORNIA AND I KIND OF WANTED JUST TO DENOTE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME SIMILARITIES BETWEEN SOME OF THE DISCUSSION AS HAPPENED IN THE LAST -- I GUESS ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP. AND SOMETHING RELATED TO I GUESS IF I'M READING THIS CORRECTLY ENHANCE BE ABLE SUPPORTS HOMES SUNSET EXTENSION. WELL OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE SEEING LANGUAGE HERE WHERE THERE'S A PROMOTION OF AN IDEAL THAT SOMETHING IT WAS GOOD NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED. AND YOU'RE HAVING LANGUAGE THE LAST ISSUE RELATED TO EXTENSIONS FOR FUNNY THEN BE CONSIDERED TO BE REMOVED. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU SEE THAT THERE'S SOME SIMILARITY ABOUT THAT. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO TO NOTE AS A SERVICE PROVIDER -- LOOKING THROUGH THE LENS DEPARTMENT FINANCE. EVERY WORKER THAT WE ACTUALLY EMPLOY IS BY EXTENSION THE STATE WORKER. WE ARE PREDICATED IN DOWN BY THE PRACTICES THAT ARE BROUGHT UP BROUGHT ALONG BY THE BUDGETARY PROCESS. AND SO THEREFORE ALL THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO ARE BASED UPON WHAT THE STATE WILL ALLOW FOR US TO DO. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THROUGH THAT LENS THE WORK FORCE ITSELF IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ATTENDED TO BECAUSE THEY ARE TAXPAYERS AND CONTRIBUTORS TO THE BASE. SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OF THE PUBLIC COMMENTS SEEING NONE SPRING BACK DOCTOR WOULD. OF JUST WITH RESPECT TO THE REGIONAL CENTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT -- I HEARD -- STANDARDIZATION I HEARD -- I SOME COMMUNITIES IN SOME REGIONAL CENTERS PROBABLY OPERATE A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY -- I I I'M GOING AMONG. RELY ON ONE THAT I THAT I JUST GETTING TO KNOW BETTER IN HUMBOLDT -- RURAL COMMUNITIES HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT NEEDS DIFFERENT CHALLENGES DIFFERENT WORK FORCES. AND AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU WANT TO STANDARDIZE EVERYTHING BUT STANDARDIZATION. IS SHOULD THERE SHOULD BE A FLOOR THERE THERE SHOULD BE SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE OTHER PROVIDERS OUT THERE ALL RELY ON ONE ANOTHER THROUGH A VERY VERY COMPLEX NETWORK OF COOPERATION. THAT YOU DON'T ALWAYS SEE -- IN OTHER AREAS AND SO. IF YOU END UP CREATING SOME STANDARDIZATION PROCESS THAT SQUASHES THAT INNOVATION. YOU'RE GONNA HURT MY COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE A SHAME BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT WITH A LITTLE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE THIS THIS CHANGE -- GROUP NEARLY TO THE DETRIMENT OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT GET SERVICES IN MY COMMUNITIES. IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR YES OF COURSE -- THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD FOR BRINGING THAT UP -- TO FURTHER CLARIFY BECAUSE REALLY THE UNIQUENESS OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS IS SOMETHING AND THE COMMUNITY IS IS SO IMPORTANT. AND SO WITH THE THE INTAKE PROCESS JUST TO THE WE'RE LOOKING AT MORE OF KIND OF THE STANDARD SERVICES THE MAKING SURE THAT THE INFORMATION PACKET. IS CONSISTENT BUT THE INFORMATION THAT WE WOULD BE DEVELOPING WOULD ALSO BE THROUGH INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND WE WOULD WELCOME CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMUNITY TO TO ALSO BE PART OF THAT INPUT BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT THERE -- TO TAKE AWAY THAT FLEXIBILITY AND UNIQUENESS BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A STANDARD COMMUNICATION OF WHAT ARE THE SERVICES OF A REGIONAL CENTER. YOU KNOW THAT ANYBODY CAN KIND OF EXPECT AND THEN CERTAINLY LOOK TO TAILOR THAT TO THOSE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE THAT THE VALUE OF A UNIQUE COMMUNITY IS IS SOMETHING -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T -- GET IN THE WAY OF WHEN I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ALWAYS WHAT HAPPENS OF COURSE WITH THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THAT COMES OUT OF GOVERNMENT SOMETIMES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT CONCLUDES ISSUE NUMBER. SIX THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION [inaudible] LET'S [inaudible] TAKE. AND TACKLE ISSUE NUMBER. SEVEN WITH ITS. TEN THOUSAND I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE ON ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY SUB ISSUES. I WILL BE ASKING QUESTIONS AFTER EACH OF THE PRESENTATIONS SO IF YOU'LL JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT TO CHECK MY NOTES ARE CHECK IN WITH ME TO SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING. THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ADDRESSED [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR PAT LARRY ACTING DIRECTOR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND WITH ME IS SUBJECT APPEAR DIRECTOR PETER BANKER WHO'S GOING TO DO MOST OF THE HEAVY LIFTING TODAY. HAPPY TO DIE THEN. YES. RIGHT THE THE VERY FIRST ITEM ON THE LIST IS THE STATE VERIFICATION HOW PLANNING ACTIVITIES THIS IS -- THE SAME PROPOSAL THAT YOU HEARD UNDER THE AGENCY BUDGET EARLIER TODAY THAT PROPOSAL IS FOR POSITIONS ACROSS -- THREE DEPARTMENTS TO OF THOSE POSITIONS ARE IN OUR DEPARTMENT. AND AND THAT'S THAT PARTICULAR ITEM THE THE SECOND ITEM RELATES TO THE ATTEMPT TO REPLACE THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES -- LEGACY SYSTEM THAT WE'VE BEEN USING -- WE'RE ASKING HERE TO EXTEND EIGHT OF OUR EXISTING POSITIONS FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS THAT THAT PROJECT IS UNDERGOING ADDITIONAL REVIEW BY -- OUR OUR FEDERAL FUNDING AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- ENHANCE THE LIMITED TERM NATURE THE EXTENSION REQUESTED FOR THOSE EXISTING RESOURCES. THE THIRD ISSUE IS TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF OUR DISASTER SERVICES BUREAU IT HAS BECOME APPARENT -- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT -- THEIR CONTINUING DISASTERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ONLY GETTING WORSE AND MORE FREQUENT -- AND THEIR THEIR SCOTT THEIR SIZE AND SCOPE IS ALSO INCREASING -- WE NEED THIS ADDITIONAL STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT CRITICAL IMPORTANT PRE PLANNING AND EXERCISE WORK OUT IN THE FIELD TO DEVELOP. THE MUSCLE MEMORY THAT'S REALLY NECESSARY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER RESPOND ORDERS -- IN DISASTERS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT TO DO WHEN THEY NEED TO DO IT -- AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING THAT NGUYEN DISASTERS ARE OCCURRING WHICH WE ARE FINDING IS HAPPENING NOW ON A MORE SIMULTANEOUS SPACES WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE STAFF IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AT THE SAME TIME. ALL OF OUR STAFF. OUR STAFF RESPOND IN PERSON TO THESE SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE TIME REGRETTABLY NEXT WITNESS. WELL AT ACTUALLY IF I MAY ASK MY QUESTION. WE HAVE THE PRESENTATION ABOUT CAL FRESH THERE WAS A REQUEST FOR IT -- 900-100-0900 THOUSAND FOR THE AUTOMATION OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE A DISASTER. AND CAL FRESH IS BEING DONE -- EXTRA MEGA WHY DON'T YOU ADDRESS THAT ISSUE I THINK. YOU WOULD BE IN THE BEST POSITION TO ADDRESS THEM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND WITH RESPECT TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE STATE'S STAFF AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WE DO SUPPORT IT -- SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MASS SHELTER IN THE CASE OF EMERGENCIES AND THE PROVISION OF EMERGENCY BENEFITS. I'D NOTE THAT THE TWENTY POSITIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ARE PART OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTY P. WISE ACROSS STATE AGENCIES IN THE MAY REVISION. OVERALL THE GOVERNOR ADDED FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE MAY REVISION TO ENHANCE THE STATE'S PREPAREDNESS. FOR EMERGENCIES -- OVER A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS AND I THINK HE'S TO BE COMMENDEDFOR A BUT WE WERE MOST SURPRISED THAT A ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WE REQUESTED. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY PROVIDE CAL FRESH TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING ELSE. SO THAT WE COULD DO IT QUICKLY AND ACCURATELY AND THAT'S CLIENTS MOVE THEM FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY AS MANY HAVE TO DO TO FIND A PLACE TO LIVE WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THEM BETTER SERVICE SO. IT IS IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THAT WE ENHANCE OUR PREPAREDNESS BUT IT IT IT. BOGGLES THE MIND THAT THIS SMALL ONE TIME AMOUNT. THAT REALLY GETS LIFE SERVING LIFESAVING BENEFITS TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST AT THE EVER AT THE MOMENT THAT THEY NEED IT WAS LEFT OUT OF THE PACKAGE SO WE HOPE THAT WE COULD WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. TO RECONSIDER THAT PIECE. AND VERY SPECIFICALLY I WOULD LIKE DSS AND DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO RESPOND -- CERTAINLY I'D BE APPRECIATE MISTER MARCUS DESCRIPTION OF IT -- CURRENTLY AS HE DESCRIBED THE ABILITY TO PROCESS DISASTER CONFERENCE APPLICATIONS IS NOT AUTOMATED WITHIN THE WELFARE SYSTEM SO LARGELY COUNTIES RESPONDING TO DISASTERS -- CURRENTLY RELY ON PAPER FORMS TO THAT -- MAKE MAKE ALL OF THAT HAPPENED -- AND AND THAT'S IT IN FACT THE CASE SO WE DO THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW AUTOMATING SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND MAKING IT AVAILABLE IS CERTAINLY A PROCESS IMPROVEMENT IT SIMPLY WASN'T FUNDED AS A PRIORITY IN THE GOVERNOR'S MY REVISION. HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF WERE THE THINGS -- THAT PRESUMABLY WEREN'T INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISIONS. AS GOOD AS IT IS. FROM THE FINANCE TERRORISTS FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK WE JUST POINT OUT THAT WE DO ON AN ANNUAL BASIS PROVIDE A ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS -- FUNDS FOR CAL SAWS. ARE PRIMARILY TO ALLOW COUNTY USED TO MAKE NECESSARY PROCESS CHANGES TO MAKE. ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCIES SUCH AS THESE AND WHEN THERE IS A STATE OR FEDERAL PROGRAM OR CHANGE. THAT FORCES MORE WORK WHAT ON THE COUNTIES OR THE AUTOMATION SYSTEM WE TRADITIONALLY PAY FOR THAT. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THIS COULD BE FUNDED WITHIN THE EXISTING A MINNOW RESOURCES. MISTER MAKER WOULD DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE THE MANAGER THAT ISN'T THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT COMPLETELY ACCURATE WHAT IS TRUE. IS THAT THERE ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND HOURS -- THE BETTER PER YEAR FOR MAINTENANCE AND-OPERATIONS CHANGES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO SAUCE THAT NUMBER HASN'T CHANGED IN YEARS PROBABLY OVER A DECADE -- THAT MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS BUDGET HAS TO FIND NOT JUST PROCESS CHANGES THAT THE COUNTY FIND IMPORTANT BUT IT ALSO PROP IT ALSO IS USED. TO AUTOMATE POLICY CHANGES THAT THE STATE DOES NOT BELIEVE WARRANT ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING SO IT'S NOT. IT IT'S NOT ACCURATE TO IMPLY THAT IT'S IF THE COUNTIES WANTED DUE PROCESS HE'S BETTER THEY HAVE THEIR OWN MONEY FOR IT. IT'S THE ERIC TO AUTOMATE IMPROVEMENTS THAT YOU WANT AND THAT YOU'VE ASKED FOR AND THE RESOURCES THAT WE'VE GOTTEN HAVE NOT INCREASED WHILE THE NUMBER OF CHANGES THAT PEOPLE HAVE STOP WITH ADVOCATES AND POLICYMAKERS. HAS INCREASED CONSIDERABLY IF WE HAD THE RESOURCES WITHIN THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS BUDGET WE WE WOULD HAVE FUNDED IT BUT I WOULD SAY THE ARGUES IT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING ARGUMENT. BECAUSE WE GIVE DSS A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW -- TO DO THEIR WORK. THE BUDGET DIDN'T SAY IF YOU LOOK IF IT'S A REALLY A PRIORITY FOR YOU TO DO ENHANCED. DISASTER RESPONSE YOU CAN DO IT WITHIN YOUR EXISTING BUDGET. THE BUDGET SAYS WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH AS A STATE AND THE REALITY OF MULTIPLE. BE. DISASTERS ARE HAPPENING ALL TOO FREQUENTLY ARE SUCH THAT WE NEED TO STEP IT UP WE NEED TO ADD MORE RESOURCES. SO WE'VE ADDED OVER A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS TO VARIOUS AGENCIES TO WHOM WE DIDNOT SAY IF THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR YOU YOU CAN USE YOUR EXISTING MONEY. BUT FOR NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE THE PROVISION OF FOOD TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING THE ANSWER IS IF IF THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTIES THAT CAN DO IT WITH THEIR MONEY SO -- I BRISTLE AT THE SUGGESTION THAT THAT WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES OR THAT IT IS NOT THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IS THE NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR. PRICE TAG ON THIS IS THAT IS THAT ESTIMATES ACCURATE. WITH THAT TAKE CARE OF THIS ISSUE. I WOULD I WOULD NOTE THAT WE GET THOSE ESTIMATES FROM THE CONSORTIA SO IF THE CONSORTIUM TERMINATE THAT'S THE PRICE TAG. WE WOULD MOST LIKELY AGREE WITH THAT. AFTER LOOKING INTO IT. THIS IS A PICTURE OF A GOVERNMENT APARTMENT IF I CAN ADD TO THAT THAT WAS THE STATE GENERAL FUND PORTION AS WE UNDERSTAND IT WE BELIEVE THE ENTIRE TOTAL PRICE TAG WAS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION WITH THAT THE GENERAL FUND BEING MATCHED BY FEDERAL FUNDS. JUST FOR CLARITY [inaudible] THANK YOU. IF IF IT IS IN THAT YOU'RE USUALLY AFTER LOOKING AT IT SO IF YOU'RE ARE YOU GOING TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN IS THIS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. I WOULD NOTE THAT KURT CURRENTLY BASED ON THIS CONVERSATION WERE MAINTAIN THE POSITION THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD BE PRIORITIZE WITHIN COUNTY RESOURCES FOR THE SAUCE SYSTEM. BUT SPECIFICALLY AS TO THE ESTIMATE. IS THE ESTIMATE ACCURATE. WE COULD CERTAINLY LOOK INTO THAT ALL RIGHT THERE WOULD YOU PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO STAFF. DEFINITELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YES START BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS DID DID ANYBODY BOTHER TO ASK THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE ENCOUNTERED THESE DISASTERS RECENTLY. OUR POWER WENT [inaudible] YEAH. AND THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE FOR THE PROPOSAL -- WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH COUNTIES DURING DISASTERS AND AFTER DISASTERS -- IN FACT THAT THERE ARE MOST CRITICAL PARTNERS ALL ACROSS FROM FOR ASSISTANCE -- FOR MASS CARE AND SHELTER ORIGINALLY INITIATED BY COUNTY SUCCUMBS FROM COUNTY SO WE WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH COUNTIES. AND EACH AND EVERY TIME AS WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING MORE AND MORE LESSONS ABOUT HOW TO DO THINGS BETTER AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AHEAD OF TIME. TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE DOING THINGS BETTER FROM THIS THIS PROPOSAL IS THE RESULT OF OUR LATEST LEARNING -- AS WE WENT THROUGH EVERYTHING FROM. THE LAKE COUNTY FAR STARTING BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN UP THROUGH THE DEVASTATION AND AND CATASTROPHICFIRES IN PARADISE -- EACH TIME WE ARE LEARNING MORE AND MORE AND EACH TIME THAT THE RESPONSES ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT -- THE THE THE UNPRECEDENTED NATURE OF OF PARADISE. BROUGHT TO THE FLOOR EVEN MORE CONCERNS THAN WE'VE EVER HAD BEFORE ABOUT HOW WE OPERATE OUR SHELTERS -- WE ALWAYS HAVE CONCERNS WITH WHEN WE INITIALLY CREATED SHELTER -- WE HAVE THIS OUT FLOW OF PUBLIC CONCERN AND DESIRE TO HELP THAT BRINGS -- THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF ITEMS OF DONATED GOODS FOR EXAMPLE THE NEED TO BE MANAGED -- IN THIS PARTICULAR DISASTER WE HAD HUGE MEDICAL CONCERNS -- WHERE WE HAD CONTAGIOUS DISEASE-- PRESENT IN THE IN THE FACILITIES AND SO THE NEED TO COORDINATE WITH THEM SO AND THE DEPARTMENT POKE PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL AS LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH -- WHO PLAY A VERY CRITICAL ROLE IN THIS AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE HAND WASHING STATIONS AND AND TOILET AND SHOWER FACILITIES? IMPROPER PROCEDURES IN PLACE AS WELL AS DEALING WITH WE FREQUENTLY HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST BUT NOT ON THE SAME SCALE -- TYPICALLY IN A IN A MAJOR DISASTER THERE'S A THERE ARE RED CROSS SHELTERS THAT ARE SET UP WE SHOULD RED CROSS IN THEIR IN THEIR ROLE TO SET UP SHELTERS. FREQUENTLY THERE ALSO COUNTY OPERATED SHELTERS THE DON'T HAVE RED CROSS WE PROVIDE THEM ALL THE ASSISTANCE AND PARTNER WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE ALL THE LOGISTICAL NEEDS ARE BEING HAPPY HELPED. BUT THEN THERE ARE ALSO WHAT WE OFTEN REFER TO SORT OF POP UP SHELTERS COMMUNITY SHELTERS -- THAT ARE A REFLECTION OF NEIGHBORS HELPING NEIGHBORS AND JUST TRUCK TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING NECESSARY IN SUCH A DEVASTATING EVENT. AND THOSE SHELTERS HAVE TYPICALY BEEN -- PROBLEMATIC IN AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS THEIR VERY LARGE THEY'RE NOT -- ORGANIZED BECAUSE IT TRULY IS A NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR TYPE ORGANIZATION AND SO SEEING HOW WE CAN HELP THEM -- SUPPORT A BETTER MORE SUSTAINABLE OPERATION IN TILL IT CAN BE TRANSITION INTO SOMETHING -- THAT IS MORE SUSTAINABLE OVER TIME IS A ROLE THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY PLAYED BEFORE BUT WORST WE'RE TRYING TO PLAY THAT ROLE NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT NO MATTER WHERE PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO WIN THE IN THAT EMERGENCY WHEN THEY'RE FLEEING FOR THEIR LIVES -- THAT THEY HAVE A SAFE DEPENDABLE PLACE THAT THEY CAN GO TO WHERE THERE NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND THEY CAN ENSURE THAT THEY NOT ONLY HAVE SHELTER BUT FOOD. AND MEDICAL -- AND AS WELL AS WHATEVER ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS THAT THEY MAY HAVE TAKEN CARE OF AND THAT IN ORDER TO DO THAT THAT THERE ARE ACT. ADEQUATE STAFF AVAILABLE ADEQUATE SUPPLIES AVAILABLE -- ADEQUATE MEDICAL -- AVAILABLE DURING THAT -- I I I AM PROUD THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS GOTTEN MUCH BETTER OVER TIME I WISH THAT IT WERE NOT FOR EACH AND EVERY DISASTER TEACHING US LESSONS THAT'S PART OF THE THE REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PROPOSAL. IS WORKING WITH COUNTIES AND ESTABLISHING THOSE LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES ACCOUNTABLE ON THE ON THE GROUND THEY HAVE THE MOST AT STAKE AND FREQUENTLY ARE THERE THE MOST IMPACTED WE SAW THAT IN THE IN THE PARADISE FIRE. THAT MANY OF THE COUNTY STAFF WHO WOULD NORMALLY BE RESPONDING TO THIS WILL PERSONALLY IMPACTED BY IT -- AND SO WHEN WE WERE THERE TO TRY AND HELP THEM -- AS A AS THEY MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SUPPLIES AND AND THAT ALL THE LOGISTICS COULD BE TAKEN CARE OF AND AGAIN REGRETTABLY WE'VE WE'VE LEARNED LESSONS THIS IS THE RESULT OF TRYING TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE LESSONS WE'VE LEARNED. GET AHEAD OF IT A LITTLE BIT TO THE EXTENT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE PARTNERSHIPS ON THE GROUND WE HAVE PRE IDENTIFIED DISASTER -- RELOCATION SITE SO POTENTIAL SHELTERS WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE WE'VE IDENTIFIED THEM WHO HAVE SHOWERS WHERE IS WHERE EIGHTY A FACILITIES AVAILABLE SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE OF ADA NEEDS -- ARE TAKING CARE OF HAVING ALL OF THAT ON THE GROUND AHEAD OF TIME CAN MAKE THE ACTUAL DISASTER RESPONSE GO A LOT MORE SMOOTHLY THERE WILL ALWAYS BEISSUES THAT COME UP THERE'S ALWAYS NEED A NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY. BUT HAVING THAT AS I DESCRIBED EARLIER MUSCLE MEMORY -- THAT EVERY PERSON EVERY RESPONDER EVERY LOCAL AGENCY NOTES AND AND STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AS WELL BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF COORDINATION -- WITH WITH -- LOCAL RESPONDERS UP TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THEM KNOW THEIR ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES AND HAS EVER HAVE EVERYBODY CELL PHONE NUMBERS KNOW WHO THEIR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES ARE HAVE AND HAVING ESTABLISHED NEIGHBORHOODS WE WE ARE THAT RELATIONSHIPS WE SAW THAT IT WAS REALLY CRITICAL DURING THE NAPA. AND SONOMA FIRES IS THAT THE FOLKS WHO WERE RESPONDING FROM OUR STAFF THERE HAD ALREADY HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL COUNTY STAFF TO KNOW THAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE PERSON WHO IS GOING TO BE ON SCENE THAT WAS THE PERSON THAT THEY COULD CALL AND THAT WAS. THERE TO HELP THEM TO ME SPECIFICALLY TO HELP THE COUNTY GET WHATEVER THAT THEY NEEDED -- AND THAT MADE THOSE OPERATIONS WHICH WAS ALSO ONE PRESIDENT AND THAT IT'S TIME GO A LOT MORE SMOOTHLY THAN IT THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE. THAT NIGHT CRESCENTA AND THERE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN A LOT OF A LOT OF WHAT THIS CON INTO THAT SO -- I GUESS -- THE QUESTION I REALLY WAS TRYING TO GET TO AND BUT THE INFORMATION IS VERY VALUABLE AND CLATTER I'M GLAD IT'S COME OUT. WAS -- DID YOU TALK TO THE COUNTIES ABOUT. CALIBRATION AND THE FOODS AND FOOD THAT WAS THE THAT WAS. AND THE BOTTLE NECK THEN THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT WERE HAVING THAT THERE HAVE WITHOUT PUBLIC LOOK I I LIVE TO THE CINEMA FIRES I'VE I'VE WENT TO PARADISE. I'VE SEEN THE DEVASTATION I'VE ALSO SEEN HOW IT IMPACTED OUR LOCAL FOOD BANKS -- THE AND FOR A LONG TIME -- AFTER AFTER THE FIRES WERE OUT AND SO -- SO THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S I'M I'M GOT KINDA BACK TO ADDRESSING MISTER MAC IS ISSUE. SO ABSOLUTELY WAY WHEN A DISASTER OCCURS THERE'S A A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE. WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WITH THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND OTHER -- AND ENTITIES TO DETERMINE AFFECTED SERVICE AREAS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS POWER OUTAGES WE GET DISASTER CALL FRESH EVEN WHEN THE GRID IS TURNED OFF BECAUSE PEOPLE'S REFRIGERATORS DON'T WORK THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. WE DO A LOT OF WORK IN THE PREPARATION OF A DISASTER CAL FRESH -- APPLICATION TO THE FADS ONCE THEY APPROVE IT WE DETERMINE THE THE WINDOW THE TIME FRAME -- THAT'S FEDERALLY DEFINED FOR FOR THAT RESPONSE ACTIVITY THERE'S THAN AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF WORK AGAIN WITH COUNTIES TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO STAFF THAT EFFORT WHERE TO LOCATE PEOPLE. JUST ACCEPT APPLICATIONS AND THEN THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF REPORTING BACK OF DATA TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ABOUT -- HOW MANY HOW MUCH ALL THOSE STANDARD TIMES OF KINDS OF QUESTIONS AUTOMATION WOULD CLEARLY BE A BENEFIT THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS YES WE'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE STRUGGLES OF? PROVIDING DISASTER CAL FRUSTRATED DURING AND AFTER IT'S REALLY. MORE OF AN AFTER FOR THE RECOVERY -- PERIOD. OKAY THANK YOU. LET'S GO TO LOCAL ASSISTANCE. THIS IS LONG YOU SAID YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY FOR FOR PROCESS I'M HAPPY. TO PAGE ELEVEN AS QUICK. PAGE TWELVE DO YOU WANT ME TO STOP FOR QUESTIONS AFTER EACH ITEM OKAY WE CAN DO THAT -- SO MAY REVISION OUR OPPORTUNITY TO UPDATE YOU ON ENROLLMENT CASELOAD FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR PROGRAM SO YOU YEAR CHART ON PAGE ELEVEN AS COMPREHENSIVE AS TO THE FUNDING OF THAT. I WON'T TALK TO AND EXPLAIN ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE CAL WORKS CASELOAD IS IS NEAR A RECORD LOW ENOUGH PROGRAM IF IF NOT A RECORD LOW PROJECTED IN THE BUDGET. BUDGET YEAR A FOR SSI -- S. S. P. THE THIRD ROW -- IF IT REFLECTS THE CONTINUED ROUGHLY WE'VE SEEN THAT NOW I THINK THIS IS OUR THIRD YEAR THAT SMEARING THE NATIONAL TREND. IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES -- YOU'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE AGING CONTACT SAY THE GRAYSON ARMY IS HERE. GRAYSON ARMY IS HERE UTILIZATION OF OUR PROGRAM IS IS INCREASING SIGNIFICANTLY -- OTHER THINGS -- TO IT TO CALL OUT HERE THERE ARE NUMBER OF ADJUSTMENTS AND REALIGNED PROGRAMS AND I'D SIMPLY MAYBE JUMP TO THE SECOND TO LAST ONE ON THE LIST. THE TITLE FOR A WAIVER THIS IS THE DO THE WAIVER THAT WE HAVE FROM THE FEDS. FOR YEARS OUR CHILD WELFARE FUNDING STREAM -- FROM THEM AND WE'VE BEEN OPERATING IN -- THE SEVEN COUNTIES FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW UNDER THIS WAIVER UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL LAW THAT WAIVER EXPIRES AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER THIRD AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER. TWENTY NINETEEN THIS YEAR AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE EFFORTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO EXTEND THAT THAT WAIVER -- FOR THE MOMENT WE EXPECT THAT WAIVER TO EXPIRE I JUST WANT TO CALL OUT THE FOR THOSE SEVEN COUNTIES LA ALAMEDA AND AND FIVE OTHERS -- IT'S A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT FISCAL IMPACT TO THEM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY'VE KNOWN THAT THEY'VE BEEN PLANNING FOR THAT -- BUT THE BUDGET DOES ASSUME THAT THE WAIVER EXPIRES PURSUANT TO KERR -- CURRENT LAW I I WILL NOTE HOWEVER THAT IN ANTICIPATION OF A POTENTIAL EXTENSION OR SOME OTHER MOVEMENT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THERE SOME PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET. THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THE FUNDING NECESSARY SHOULD THAT FEDERAL ACTION HAPPEN THAT'S VERY CONSISTENT WITH LANGUAGE WE WE ALLOW DO HAVE TO ADJUST FOR CASELOAD AND ON ANTICIPATED FEDERAL FUNDING -- MORE GENERALLY SO THOUGH THAT'S KIND OF A SUMMARY OF THE CASELOAD ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR BUDGET. WITHOUT GOING THROUGH A LOT OF THE DETAIL HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THERE. JUST ELLO LA -- WANT TO SAY SOMETHING HERE DO YOU WANT TO WAIT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GINNY FELLOW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE DONE OUR INITIAL REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S UPDATED CASELOAD FOR THE MAJOR PROGRAMS. AND WE WE AGREE WITH THE UPDATES THAT THEY HAVE BEEN AND HOW THEY ADJUST THE BUDGET NUMBERS ACCORDINGLY OF COURSE WHATEVER ACTIONS YOU TAKE SUBSEQUENTLY WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE NUMBERS AND WE'LL BE MONITORING THAT AS WELL THANK YOU. ON THE TOP OF THE PAGE TWELVE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL AND ADMINISTRATION BACKLOG THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF RESOURCE FAMILY -- APPROVAL FUNDING FOR FOR COUNTY GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION -- LAST YEAR WAS INTENDED TO BE ONE TIME AND WE'RE PROVIDING ONE TIME MONEY AGAIN IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET FOR NEXT YEAR TO ADDRESS THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL BACK LOG. WE ARE TRYING -- REALLY HARD AND AN APPRECIATE THE GREAT PARTNERSHIP WE'VE HAD WITH COUNTIES TO SPEED THE TIME TO APPROVAL FOR HOMES THAT ARE ARE THE PLACEMENTS -- FOR THE FOSTER YOUTH -- AND SO THAT'S THAT PARTICULAR ITEM HERE. I DO HAVE. I DO HAVE A QUESTION ON THAT -- WE'VE HEARD FROM THE ADVOCATES -- THE REQUEST FOR THE SIX BILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL HERE AS A ONE TIME -- ONE TIME INCREASE. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON? THIS REQUEST. IF THE SAME SIX THAT I UNDERSTAND IT TO BE IT'S INCLUDED IN THE MY REVISION HERE BUT SO I JUST RAISED HARM TO FINANCE. THROUGH THE THE ESTIMATE THE FOURTEEN MILLION THAT WAS INCLUDING THAT THAT WAS BASED ON LOOKING AT THE CURRENT CASE THE TRENDS. OF A EMERGENCY CARE CARE GIVERS WITH AN APPLICATION OPEN AND OUR FABRICATION OPEN. SO -- LOOKING AT THE FACT WITH THE CURRENT CASELOAD IS AND THAT COUNTIES HAVE BEEN MAKING SUCCESSES WITH REDUCING THAT POPULATION OR THAT CASE ALONE. THAT'S GOING TO HOW WE BASED WHAT SOME OF THE WORKLOAD WOULD BE BASED OFF OF THEN WE WENT TO GET TO THE ADMIN PORTION WE LOOKED AT WHAT IS THE AVERAGE MONTHLY CASELOAD -- IN NEW CAM INCOMING APPLICATIONS LOOK AT AN ANNUAL BASIS OF WHAT THAT WOULD BE WE TOOK THAT CASE LOAD AND THEN JUST UTILIZED THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY THAT'S BEEN USED IN THE PAST. TO COME UP WITH THAT NUMBER SO -- I'D BE INTERESTED I'M NOT SURE WHERE THAT SIX BILLION SHORTFALL WOULD BE BASED ON THIS -- BECAUSE AGAIN WE LOOK AT ANNUAL NEW APPLICATIONS COMING IN AND LOOKED AT THE PREVIOUS METHODOLOGIES OF IN USE AND APPLY THAT TO A ONE YEAR -- WITHIN TWENTY LEVEL WILL WAIT TILL THE END AND SEE WITH THE ADVOCATES TELL US [inaudible] NEXT. I'M SORRY HELLO WE WOULD JUST SAY WE AGREE WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE AUGMENTATION HERE IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE RAISED IN JANUARY THAT GETTING THROUGH THAT RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS IS VERY CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE CONTINUUM CARE. OF CARE REFORM WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS ALSO ABOUT THE ACTUAL NUMBER HERE SO WE ARE BEGINNING TO WRITE THEM AND GET THEM TO THE ADMINISTRATION. OF SOME OF THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBERS MAY BE RELATED TO THE AMOUNT THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL. IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND AS WELL. VERY GOOD THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT. ONE SORRY PLATE PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL -- FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW -- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FILL THE GAP FOR FAMILIES WHEN THEY GET THE CALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND ARE ASKED TO TAKE A KID -- WE DON'T WAIT TO START PAYING THEM TO HELP SUPPORT THAT CHILD UNTIL THE HOME HAS BEEN APPROVED WE PLAY PAY PAY NOW EFFECTIVE -- THE DATE THAT THE CHILD CAME TO THAT FAMILY AND SO WE'RE REALLY PROUD TO SEE THAT POLICY CONTINUED HERE IN THE BUDGET -- WE'RE PROPOSING AGAIN I'M I'M GOING FUNDING FOR THAT -- RIGHT -- UNDER CURRENT LAW AS WRITTEN IN BUDGET YEAR STATE FUNDING FOR THAT PURPOSE WOULD BE AVAILABLE ONLY UP TO NINETY DAYS -- AND WE'RE PROPOSING IN THE MAY REVISION TO MAKE THAT STATE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS AND THEN IF I COUNTY CAN SHOW GOOD CAUSE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO APPROVE THAT FAMILY FOR INSTANCE DELAYS IN PROCESSING A BACKGROUND CHECK. WELL OR OTHER REASONABLE MEASURES -- THAT WE WOULD ALLOW -- GOOD BECAUSE PAYMENT AT STATE EXPENSE UP TO A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. MA'AM SO THERE'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOLLARS ON THE SIDE OF WONDERFUL. I KNOW THE THIS IS HELPFUL -- BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS AND LATER WE'LL HEAR FROM THE ADVOCATES REGARDING THIS. LA OVER TO PART OF FINANCE. WE'RE STILL WAITING TO RECEIVE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ON THIS BUT ONCE WE RECEIVE THAT WE WILL REVIEW IT AND LOOK AT IT IN LIGHT OF THE LATEST DATA RELATED TO THE TIME IT'S TAKING TO GET THROUGH THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS AND KIND OF LOOK AT THOSE. THAT THE WHAT PROPOSED RELATED TO THE ACTUAL. OKAY NEXT ITEM. WELL THE NEXT ITEM -- REFLECTS INTO AN ONGOING -- PROGRAM AS WELL -- THAT FOSTER CARE A RETENTION RECRUITMENT AND SUPPORT WE COLLEGE SHIPPERS -- AND AND THIS IS REALLY THE FINDING THAT'S AND ENABLING COUNTY IS TO TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO THE WAY THAT THEY DO FAMILY FINDING AND THOSE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS -- THE THAT HELP US -- FINE PLACEMENTS AND GOOD QUALITY PLACEMENTS FOR THE FOSTER YOU THIS IS ONE MORE YEAR OF FUNDING IT HAD BEEN SCHEDULED -- TO TO TO EXPIRE AND AND I'M A REVISION INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF FUNDING FOR THAT ACTIVITY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. HELLO WE HAVE NO CONCERNS AT THIS PROPOSAL. I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE THE CLARITY THAT IT'S A ONE TIME FUNDING FOR PERMITS ON ON GOING PROGRAM -- THE ROUTE THE ON GOING -- PORTION OF IT WAS REALIGNED BUT THE ME REVISION INCLUDES A ONE TIME -- INVESTMENT -- FOR THIS PAPERS ACTIVITY. VERY GOOD -- MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLANCA RUBIO BEFORE SHE LEFT HAD -- A STATEMENT SHE WANTED TO TO TO BE SHARED WITH YOU. SO I WANT TO SHARE THIS ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. SHE SAYS I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO LEARN THAT THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE DID NOT INCLUDE A BUDGET INCREASE TO FUND FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES SOCIAL WORKERS. FFA RATES HAVE BEEN FROZEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE WERE CUT AN ADDITIONAL 10%. TWO THOUSAND NINE AND THEN FROZEN AGAIN FOR THE NEXT SIX YEARS. SUBSEQUENT TIME RATE INCREASES IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SEVENTEEN TEMPORARILY HELP ALLEVIATE THE CRISIS AND IF A FAKE SOCIAL WORKER SALARIES BUT ONLY BY A SMALL MARGIN. ANSYS TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FUNDING HAS AGAIN BEEN FROZEN. FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES TAKE CARE OF THIRTEEN THOUSAND FOSTER KIDS DAILY WHICH IS 25% OF ALL FOSTER KIDS. EVER PHASE RECRUIT AND TRAIN TWO THIRDS OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S NON RELATED FOSTER RESOURCE PARENTS. DSS STRONGLY BELIEVES. FFA IS ARE CRUCIAL TO THE CONTINUUM OF CARE SUCCESS SHE CONTINUES. COMPLYING WITH STATE LAWS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION MORE IMPORTANTLYOUR KIDS AND FAMILIES NEED STABILITY AND IF WE CAN'T FIND. WE CAN'T FUND THE SOCIAL WORKERS TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW. THEN WHAT WILL WE TELL THE KIDS WHEN THEY'RE SOCIAL WORKERS CAN'T REMAIN IN THEIR LIVES. CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS AND NOW WE NEED. TO MAKE SURE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR WORK FORCE. IS NOT OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THIS LAW. OUR STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT EXEMPTS PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES BE PAID DOUBLE THE MINIMUM WAGE AND RIGHT NOW THE STATE DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE MANDATED. MINIMUM WAGE LAW TO PAY EFFORT FACED SOCIAL WORKERS WHO BY LAW ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A MASTER'S DEGREE -- SHE CONTINUES FFA SOCIAL WORKERS NEED TO BE AVAILABLE TO THEIR FOSTER CHILDREN AND RESOURCE FAMILIES WHEN THEY WHEN AND WHERE NEEDED. DAYS EVENINGS WEEKDAYS AND WEEKENDS. TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW STATE BUDGET ALLOCATION OF TWENTY SIX MILLION IS NEEDED STARTING JULY. ONE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND SHE ALLEN'S OF BY STATING I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO INCLUDE THIS IN ONE OF OUR BUDGET PRIORITY ASKS. TO BE INCLUDED. FOR APPROVAL ON MAY TWENTY FIRST THANK YOU. OKAY NEXT ITEM. NEXT ITEM IS RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD SEVERAL MONTHS AGO THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILY REVISES LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF THE ALLOWABLE USES OF TITLE. FORTY CHILD WELFARE FUNDING TO ALLOW THE THE FUNDING OF DEPENDENCY COUNSEL AS WELL -- FOR FOR IT FOR THE CHILDREN -- AS IT IS IN THE IN THE SYSTEM -- FOR US -- THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL I BELIEVE HAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND ITS BUDGET ALREADY FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVIDING DEPENDENCY COUNCIL. AND WE EXPECT THAT -- THAT THAT EXISTING GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTION WILL PROVIDE THE STATE MATCH FOR THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING -- THAT WE'RE ESTIMATING WE THINK -- THAT BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO TRAIN -- FOLKS ON ON WHICH ALLOW WHICH ACTIVITIES ARE ALLOWABLE AND DID ON THE ON THE INSTRUCTIONS. FOR ANYWAY SORRY LONG WINDED. LOTS OF PEOPLE NEED TO BE TRAINED ON LOTS OF THINGS TO AVOID AUDIT FINDINGS AND DO THIS CORRECTLY AND STILL -- GET THE THE GET THE FUNDING AN INCREASE REPRESENTATION FOR KIDS THIS FOR US IS A PASS THROUGH OF THAT FOR YOU MONEY TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL FOR THEIR ALLOCATION TO THOSE DEPENDENCY COUNCIL PROVIDERS. AT FULL IMPLEMENTATION WE EXPECT OF ROUGHLY SIXTY TO SIXTY FIVE MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS ULTIMATELY TO BE AVAILABLE ANNUALLY FOR THIS PURPOSE. SO THIS DOES REFLECT A RAMP UP AT AROUND THIRTY FOUR MILLION. WONDERFUL THANK YOU. HELLO FROM THE FINANCE. I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT -- TO ATTEND I WENT -- TO DIRECTOR OF TO MAKE IT SAID THAT THERE AT THE FUNDING ON THE STATE OPERATION SIDE FOR THIS WILL BE WITHIN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH -- IT'S NOTED IN THE JUDICIAL -- BRANCHES FINANCE LETTER -- AND SO I BELIEVE IT'S ROUGHLY ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND WHICH IS INCLUDED FOR THAT.

IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND AND THAT MAY REVISION. THANK YOU NEXT ITEM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AT THE TIME THAT WE RELEASED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- AND IT INCLUDED A NEW METHODOLOGY FOR BUDGETING AYE HSS ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES THERE WAS AN OUTSTANDING ISSUE WITH THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES WE WORKED WITH THEM OVER THE SPRING -- THEY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DATA TO US AND WHAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU IS A COMBINED ROUGHLY THREE POINT SIX THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. A CONSISTENT WITH AN AGREED UPON METHOD ELEPHANT OLOGY BASED ON THEIR BACKGROUND THE NUMBER OF BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT THEY PROCESS. THANK YOU THIS IS A WORKLOAD ADJUSTMENT THANK YOU NEXT ITEM. SIMILARLY HOW -- WE WE HAVE DONE SOME WORK TO SOLIDIFY OUR IMPLEMENTATION PLANS FOR ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION WITHIN THE I JUST SAYS PROGRAM IN JULY ONE WE WILL BEGIN PILOTING IN A PORTION OF LA COUNTY -- AND BECAUSE LA COUNTY IS ONE OF THE LEADING COUNTIES IN OUR PILOT SCHEDULE WE EXPECT -- MORE TOTAL PEOPLE BY THE END OF THE FISCALYEAR TO BE ENROLLED IN ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION. THEN WE HAD NOT ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED BACK IN JANUARY SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS PULLING MONEY FROM BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE AND PUTTING IT INTO THE BUDGET YEAR WITHOUT CHANGING. OUR OVERALL COST OF IMPLEMENTING THAT THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU I KNOW THAT THE ADVOCATES OF TALKED ABOUT THE GAP AND WILL LET THEM DISCUSS THAT WHEN THEY DURING PUBLIC COMMENT. I HSS RESTORATION OF THE 7% THE NEXT ITEM. OKAY -- THIS REALLY -- IS A REFLECTION -- HERE WE'RE ASKING FOR SOME FUNDING ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON THE COST OF RESTORING THE 7% AS I INDICATED EARLIER CASELOAD IS HIGHER SO THE COST OF IT RESTORING THE 7% IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER AS WELL. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MAINTAINS THE THE I'M SORRY THE MAY REVISION MAINTAINS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL TO SUSPEND THE 7% REDUCTION. OF IN THE CURRENT FISCAL IN OUT OF BUDGET YEAR. THE MAYOR STREET SORRY I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM LA ON THIS. JACKIE PURSUE A LEO -- WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THERE IS A CHANGE RELATIVE TO WHAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR DID PROPOSE TO MAKE THE CONTINUED RESTORATION OF I JUST A SERVICE HOURS ON GOING -- HOWEVER IN MAY -- THAT THE PROPOSAL'S NOW TO TEMPORARILY RESTORE I JUST A SERVICE HOURS -- UNTIL UP TO DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS WAS NOTED IN MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS AROUND DDS OUR OFFICE DID RAGED RAISED -- GENERAL BROADER ISSUES REGARDING THE IMPLICIT PRIORITIZATION OF NEW ON GOING -- COMMITMENTS FUNDING -- LARGELY AT THE EXPENSE OF A EXISTING AND CONTINUING PROGRAM COMMITMENTS [inaudible] THANK YOU. JUST BERMAN FINANCE WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THIS AT THIS TIME. SITTING TEMAS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD JUST ECHO THE COMMENTS MY CALLING ME EARLIER IN REGARDS TO THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL FOR SUN SETTING THESE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS. CLEARLY WE WILL BE HEARING FROM THE ADVOCATES ON THIS ISSUE -- AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE THE JANUARY -- BUDGET PROPOSAL -- PROVIDED GREATER STABILITY IN THIS REGARD AND NOW TO HAVE. IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE WE'RE BACKTRACKING AND NOW THERE'S A TRIGGER AND I DO NOT THE ASSEMBLY HAS REJECTED THE PROPOSAL FOR THE SUNSET TWICE. BEFORE -- BUT WE'LL WAIT AND HEAR. FROM OUR AND FROM THE ADVOCATES SHORTLY -- NEXT ITEM. NEXT ITEM YOU YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR OR WITH THE THE VOLUME OF IMMIGRANTS THAT WE'RE SEEING AND ENTERING THE COUNTRY -- WE'VE DEVELOPED COMMUNICATION BOTH WITH -- SAN DIEGO RAPID RESPONSE NETWORK AND A AND A VARIETY OF OTHER PROVIDERS -- IN IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AS WELL -- WE ARE -- FINDING SOME SHELTER OPERATIONS AND MEDICAL SCREENINGS -- SOME ASSISTANCE WITH TRANSPORTATION TO FINAL DESTINATIONS ON THOSE KINDS OF SUPPORTS AND SERVICES -- IN IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE WAS A PROPOSAL NOT JUST FOR FIVE MILLION IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THAT WE'RE NOW IN BUT ALSO TWENTY MILLION INTO THE BUDGET YEAR -- THIS NUMBER THAT YOU SEE HERE OF SEVEN POINT THREE REFLECTS COMMITMENTS WE'VE MADE TO SHELTERS ALREADY FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AND OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS. AND SO RATHER THAN LEAVE ALL TWENTY MILLION WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO ALLOCATE TO US THE BEEN TRANSFERRED DIRECTLY INTO OUR BUDGET AND THE MAYOR REVISION -- TO AVOID THAT AND AND THAT BALANCE IS STILL REMAINS TWENTY MILLION IN TOTAL -- WITH THEIR THE BALANCE OF THIS ITEM -- REMAINING IN THE IN THE PROPOSED RAPID RESPONSE FUND FOR DO F. ALLOCATION. AT THE GOVERNOR'S RESPONSE WAS -- IMMEDIATE AND VERY HUMANE. AND WE WE WE THE ASSEMBLY SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT. AND I KNOW THAT WE WILL BE DOING THE SAME MAKING SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE REFLECTS THAT -- ANYTHING FROM LA YOU. CHAS ALOE WITH THE LA -- WE'VE YOU THIS ADJUSTMENT AS LARGELY TECHNICAL IN NATURE SO I'VE OF COMMENTS [inaudible] NEXT ITEM. APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ON THE LAST ONE MADAM CHAIR -- OUR TEAM IS REALLY PHENOMENAL ON THIS ITEM YES -- AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS OF HAD REVISED ADMIN BUDGETING METHODOLOGIES IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS I I JUST MENTIONED EARLIER WE IMPLEMENTED ONE FOR IHS US -- AND WE DID -- THE NEXT ITERATION OF THAT THE CAL WORKS A METHODOLOGY HERE. I WE FOCUSED ON BIG CASE MANAGEMENT AND WILL BE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THE DIRECT SERVICES PORTION OF THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES BUDGET. THIS IS THE PORTION OF THE BUDGET IN THE IN THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES THAT SUPPORTS PEOPLE'S EFFORTS TO EITHER PURSUE EDUCATION OR WORK ACTIVITIES -- AND SO REFLECTING THAT NEW BUDGET METHODOLOGY AND IN THE BUDGET HERE'S A A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN THE SUPPORT OF THOSE POPULATIONS AND THE COUNTIES THAT DO THAT VITAL WORK. AND I AND I KNOW THAT FROM -- COUNTIES I THINK THE THE BIGGEST ISSUE AND WE'LL HEAR FROM THEM LATER. IS THE START TIME THE START DATE -- ONE MORE TIME AND PERHAPS HAVING A START DATE JULY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY RATHER THAN AS NOTED. I WOULD HEAR FROM THE ADVOCATES LATER ON THAT. THE PIECE THAT I DIDN'T HEAR THAT YOU DID REFER TO WAS THAT THE PROPOSAL TO SEPARATE CHILD CARE WITHIN A SINGLE ALLOCATION INTO ITS OWN DEDICATED FUNDING POT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY LIVED EXPERIENCE WITH THE NEW BUDGETING METHODOLOGY. AND SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS FROM COUNTIES APPRECIATE THEM BRING INTO US IN THAT CONVERSATION CAN CONTINUE OF COURSE. THANK YOU NEXT ITEM. CAROL WORKS OUT COMES AN ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW WE CALL THIS CAL OR THIS IS THE CULMINATION OF ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF OF STAKEHOLDER ACTIVITIES -- DETERMINING A NUMBER OF MEASURES THAT CAN BE USED -- IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS IS PERFORMING THE WAY THAT WE WANT TO DO IT REQUIRES COUNTY REVIEW OF ITS PROGRAM PERIODICALLY AND THE REQUEST BEFORE YOU HERE. IS INITIAL FUNDING FOR COUNTIES TO BEGIN -- THE THE EFFORT TO IMPLEMENT CAL OR BOTH IN TERMS OF DATA REPORTING AND AND ALSO SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATION CHANGES THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE. SO REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THAT EFFORT MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU NEXT ITEM. NEXT ITEM THIS IS NOT NEW WE HAVE A CONTRACT THAT WE USE WE CALL IT WORK NUMBER IT'S THE NUMBER. THAT COUNTIES CALL TO VERIFY THAT PEOPLE ARE WORKING AND WHAT THEIR INCOME IS IT ALLEVIATES THE BURDEN ON CLIENTS ARE HAVING TO BRING PAYCHECK STUBS INTO THE OFFICE SENATE FACILITATES A MORE RAPID VERIFICATION ON THE SIDE OF ELIGIBILITY WORKERS. IT'S PROVEN TO BE USEFUL ENOUGH THAT IT'S COSTS OF MORE THAN DOUBLE BECAUSE OF WITH THE UTILIZATION AS PER CALL HE SENSUALLY -- OR PER CLICK -- THERE'S AN ONLINE OPTION AS WELL SO WE HAVE A BUCKET OF CAL WORKS CONTRACTS IN A SINGLE LINE ITEM IN THE BUDGET AND WE'RE SIMPLY CARVING THIS ONE OUT AND MAKING ITS OWN AND PROVIDING US -- THE AUGMENTATION TO REFLECT ITS ACTUAL COST. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. NEXT ITEM. BUT THE NEXT ONE ALTHOUGH IT SAYS REVISED ASSUMPTIONS AND ITS TITLE IT'S NOT REALLY REVISED ASSUMPTIONS WHAT WE'RE DONE AND I'M A REVISION IS OUT FUNDING TO THE HOME VISITING PROGRAM TO MATCH THE CURRENT STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. WHERE THERE'S NO LIMITATION ON THE AGE OF THE PARENT WHO HAS A CHILD IN ORDER FOR THEM TO GET SERVICES? SO THIS IS REALLY PUTTING THE MONEY INTO MATCH WHAT THE LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES. IF YOU ADVOCATES ARE ASKING FOR A NO COST TRAILER BILL. THE BILL LANGUAGE -- WHAT IS THE RESPONSE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION? IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY THE THEIR TRAILER BILL REQUEST THAT ANY CHILD'S AGE -- ZERO TO TO BE BE -- ABLE TO ACCESS THE SERVICES AS WELL. I WOULD SAY ON A POLICY BASIS WERE FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT THAT'S EXACTLY THE POPULATION THAT HOME VISITING PROGRAMS BENEFIT. ON THE FISCAL SIDE I WOULD SIMPLY SAY THAT WE'RE NOT FAR ENOUGH AND IMPLEMENTATION WHERE I HAVE ACTUAL DATA ON TAKE UP RATES ARE BUDGET IS PURELY -- AND A BUDGET BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE NUMBER OR PERCENTAGE OF ALL ALL FAMILIES THAT ARE POSSIBLY ELIGIBLE THAT WOULD AGREED TO PARTICIPATE THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM NOT A MANDATORY PROGRAM -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT WOULDN'T CHANGE UNDER THE ADVOCATE PROPOSAL SO BUT GIVEN THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO HAVE A FISCAL COMMENT BUT WE COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE POLICY INTENT. WITH WITH REGARD TO THE LANGUAGE OF WOOD. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE LAW CAN ONLY BE INTO IMPLEMENTED TO THE DEGREE THAT WE HAVE THE FUNDING -- SO THE THE IT SEEMS THAT THE REQUEST OF THE ADVOCATES -- MAKING A UNIVERSAL OFFER HOME VISITING -- WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE. WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE HERE. IS THERE A REASON WHY THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. SPECIFICALLY -- THAT THE ADVOCATES ARE REQUESTING -- IS THERE SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ISN'T IS NOT AGREEMENT WITH. NO I I CONFESS IT'S BEEN A FEW -- HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF TIME SINCE I PERSONALLY READ THAT LANGUAGE BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS. YOU KNOW WHEN WE BUILT THIS PROGRAM AND WE ENACTED A STATUTE WE DELIVER LEASES SAID WE WANTED TO PRIORITIZE HELP FOR FIRST TIME PARENTS WITH YOUNGER KIDS. AND NOW WITH THIS THAT LANGUAGE WOULD GO BEYOND THAT PRIORITIZATION TO FIND ANY CHILD WHETHER IT'S YOUR SECOND THIRD OR FOURTH CHILD. IN THAT AGE RANGE -- YOU KNOW THAT OBVIOUSLY MAKES SENSE BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A FURTHERANCE A OF THE POLICY PRIORITY WE SET FORTH WHEN THAT WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY IMPLEMENTED. I WOULD ELSE THAT -- THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TAKE A FRESH LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE. BECAUSE THERE IS. THERE IS GREAT INTEREST IN IMPLEMENTING THAT LANGUAGE. INTERNET WE CAN COMMIT TO THAT THANK YOU. COMMENTS FROM LA -- SPECIFICALLY ON THAT ISSUE. YES THANK YOU -- ONE OF THE POINTS WE BROUGHT UP LAST YEAR IN IN JANUARY WHEN THE HOME VISITING INITIATIVE WAS INITIALLY PROPOSED WAS THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. TO TO GET A FEEL FOR THE THE BUDGET REQUIREMENTS IT'S A NEW PROGRAM -- THAT THE STATE WAS OPERATING AND EVEN A YEAR. IN THE FUTURE NOW WHERE WE ARE TODAY WE STILL KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT HOW IMPLEMENTATION IS GOING -- THE FOR THE VERY FIRST COUNTIES HAVE JUST NOW -- GOTTEN THE FIRST HOME VISITING SERVICES UP AND GOING IN THE HOME VISITING INITIATIVE IT'LL BE SOME TIME TO ECHO -- PREVIOUS COMMENTS BEFORE REBEL TO TO FINE TUNE THE BUDGET METHODOLOGY -- OUR COMMENTS REGARDING THE THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WHETHER UNIVERSAL OR MORE NARROW -- AS THE MINISTRATION IS NOTED THE PROGRAM AS IT IS IS NOT AN ENTITLEMENT -- A COUNTIES ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES BASED ON THE FUNDING ALLOCATION THAT THEY RECEIVE. AND SO THERE'S SOME FLEXIBILITY OF THE STATE DECIDED TO MAKE A MORE UNIVERSAL OFFER. THE FISCAL CONSTRAINT WOULD STILL BE IN PLACE -- COUNTY'S ONLY BE ABLE TO OFFER SERVICES TO THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES OUT FOR WHICH THEY HAD -- RESOURCES AVAILABLE -- SWEDISH SUCH POINT OUT THAT THAT SLIGHT DISTINCTION. I THINK I ONCE HEARD HEARD IT SAID THAT TO VISION IS WHAT DRIVES IMPLEMENTATION SO WE DO KNOW THAT THE THE THE GOVERNOR HAS TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF OF TAKING CARE THE VERY YOUNGEST -- THAT HAS BEEN HIS VISION WE WERE WE'RE HEARING THIS. DARE I SAY FOR THE FIRST TIME -- AND IT'S WE LOVE HEARING IT I THINK THAT IF IF THIS IS A COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE -- THEN LOOKING AT THAT LANGUAGE AND MAKING SURE THAT IT IS MORE INCLUSIVE I THINK WOULD SERVICE ALL BETTER. OKAY LET'S GO TO THE NEXT ITEM. YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE THAT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TOWN OF FUNDING GOES TO FIND CAL GRANTS AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION THIS IS A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT. IS KIND OF WHAT WE CALL OUR BALANCE OR IN THE TOWN OF BUDGET AND SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS OF THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION THERE SO THAT THAT'S A SMALL AND RELATIVELY SMALL ADJUSTMENT -- IN THAT FUNDING IS A C. RIGHT SIZING. OF FEDERAL MONEY. FOR FEDERAL FUNDS OKAY. LET'S GO TO THE NEXT ITEM OKAY BUT THE NEXT -- ONE YOU MAY RECALL IN THE IN THE RESPONSE TO THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET COUNTIES RAISED CONCERNS WITH THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF SUN FOR A FUNDING AVAILABLE. FOR COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT WE CALLED IT THEN **** I CASH OUT WE NOW CALL IT THE IT CAL FIRST EXPANSION TO SSI POPULATIONS -- MORE APPROPRIATELY DESCRIPTIVE O WHAT IT IS -- IN CONVERSATIONS WITH COUNTIES WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONCERN THERE THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY FORTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS -- IN pTO BE AVAILABLE FOR TWO COUNTIES -- SINCE THE MAYOR REVISIONIST COME OUT AND I'VE SEEN THE LANGUAGE PRINTED AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE THIRTEEN IN YOUR AGENDA COUNTIES OF RAISE CONCERNS SO THAT MIGHT BE. A PROPOSED ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS THAT'S TOO COMPLEX AND NOT TIMELY ENOUGH FOR SUCCESS -- THAT WAS NOT THE INTENT AND SO THAT THAT CONVERSATION CAN CONTINUE WITH COUNTIES. IN TERMS OF HOW WE MAKE THAT FUNDING AVAILABLE TO THEM -- AND WHEN COUNTIES CAME WITH THE CONCERN ABOUT THE LEVEL OF ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING IT CAME WITH CONCERNS ABOUT -- THE AMOUNT OF THE NUMBER OF HOURS IT WOULD TAKE TO HANDLE CASES THE COST PER HOUR -- AND THOSE THOSE KINDS OF OF THINGS AS WELL -- AND WE'VE -- MADE A VERBAL COMMITMENT TO COUNTY IS THAT IN THE COMING FALL WE WOULD TO TAKE A FRESH LOOK AT HOW WE THERE WOULD BE MAYBE THE NEXT PROGRAM WE WE MODERNIZE THE METHODOLOGY FOR ADMINISTRATION BUDGETING ON BUT NOT WITHSTANDING THAT WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THESE. FORTY ALMOST FORTY THREE MILLION AND RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE -- THIS EARLY IN THE BUDGET YEAR FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS IMPORTANT POLICY CHANGE WE DIDN'T WANT. CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RATES AND HOURS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO TO GET IN THE WAY OF GETTING PEOPLE THROUGH THE DOOR AND PROCESSED ACCURATELY. I THINK I THINK THE WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE COUNTIES. THERE'S A GREAT OBJECTION TO THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IT'S THAT SPECIFIC LANGUAGE. MAKING IT ALMOST CONTINGENT -- WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE IS AN INCREASED WORKLOAD WE ALREADY KNOW THE WORK HAS TO BE DONE. THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE -- IS. SO THE THE THE PART OF THE SENTENCE MAY BE EXPANDED FOR UNANTICIPATED COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. I THINK IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE EXPENDED FOR THAT SO. TO TO REMOVE THAT PERHAPS BUT CONVERSATIONS I'M SURE WILL CONTINUE. AS TO THE LANGUAGE -- SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THE TRAILER BILL. TIGER WOODS FARMER FAST MA'AM CHAIR WE WERE WILLING TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS WE RECOGNIZE THOSE CONCERNS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY NEXT ITEM. I DID LA -- DID YOU WANT TO ADDRESS. I JUST GONNA SAY WE WOULD ALSO BE TRACKING THE LANGUAGE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WOULD HAVE ON COUNTY ADMIN. WONDERFUL THANK YOU. I'M NOT TRYING TO EXCLUDE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YOU KNOW YOU JUST LET US KNOW IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING -- NEXT ITEM. ON THE TOP OF PAGE -- FOURTEEN CAL WORK STAGE -- STAGE ONE TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY -- YOU YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR THAN A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS NOW WHEN YOU. COME COME TO THEM YOU HAVE A TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY -- AND WE'RE SIMPLY -- EXTENDING THAT POLICY INTO STAGE ONE WHERE DOES NOT UP TO THIS POINT EXISTED -- IN THE PROGRAM SO WE VIEWED AS VERY POSITIVE CHANGE PROVIDING WHEN YOU COME INTO STAGE ONE THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE MOST UNSTABLE ACROSS ALL OF THE CAL WORK STAGES IT MAKES THE MOST SENSE ON A POLICY BASIS. AND PARTICULARLY ON A CHILD BASIS THAT WOULD THEY PREFER TO HAVE THAT -- STABILITY -- AND THERE'S SOME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF COURSE TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE. VERY GOOD SITE AND I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR BRACING CENTER MITCHELL'S -- BILL AND AND WHAT SHE'S TRYING TO DO HERE. I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SO THAT WILL BE FOR THE DISCUSSION -- LA -- ANY COMMENTS. ONLY ONLY TO ADD THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR PROPOSALS -- NEWLY IN THE MAY REVISION AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE TRAILER BILL WAS JUST RELEASED I THINK SINCE THIS HEARING BEGAN SO WE'LL BE REVIEWING THAT WHEN WE GET. AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF AND OBVIOUSLY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IT AND PROVIDE OUR COMMENTS AND SUCH A WONDERFUL THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT ITEM. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THE CAL LEARN PROGRAM THIS IS FOR PREGNANT AND PARENTING TEENS -- THAT IT IT -- FALL OF FOLLOW AS CERTAIN CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES PRESCRIBED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IT RECENTLY CHANGE THE STANDARDS -- FOR FOR CASE MANAGEMENT TO TO INCREASE THEM. WE DON'T EXPECT COUNTIES TO JUMP TO THAT NEW STANDARD IMMEDIATELY SO THAT THIS IS AN INITIAL INVESTMENT IN PHASING IN THAT POLICY CHANGE -- IT WE VIEW THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THE SUPPORT -- FOR CALIFORNIA. FORGET THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT ITEM. WELL OUR DEPARTMENT AMONG OTHERS IS PROUD TO THIS -- ADMINISTER THE TAX -- CHECK OFF OF FUND FOR SPECIAL OLYMPICS AND THE GUY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS IN ADDITION TO THAT TAX CHECK OFF WORK IN ADDITIONAL A ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO PASS THROUGH TO THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS. PURSUANT TO THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU SEE HERE WHICH SAYS WHAT I JUST SAID. VERY GOOD -- I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY ISSUE ON THAT PARTICULAR -- ONE IT NEXT ITEM PLEASE -- THIS ONE I'M PROBABLY NOT THE BEST EQUIPPED BUT I'LL TRY TO SUMMARIZE IT FOR YOU -- WE MAINTAIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGETS -- PROPOSED MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT OBLIGATION THIS IS SIMPLY AN UPDATE. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND IN RECOGNITION OF FLUCTUATIONS IN REALIGNMENT REVENUES SO THIS IS. KEEPING THE AMMO WE WHERE WE PROPOSE A FOR COUNTIES BUT THE STATE'S PICKING UP A SLIGHTLY LARGER SHARE DUE TO REALIGNMENT REVENUE -- BEING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT [inaudible] THEM PREVIOUSLY. COMMENTS FROM ILLEGAL. AS WAS MENTIONED THIS IS MAINTAINING THE JANUARY GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO REDUCE THE I JUST A SEMI WE FOR COUNTIES IT'S JUST GONNA COST US MORE TO DO IT. PER MAY REVISION ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL I JUST AS PROGRAM COSTS -- THIS IS SOMETHING ALSO THAT WE WOULD -- BE TRACKING FOR REVISED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AS WELL WHICH HASN'T BEEN -- UPDATED YET -- BUT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE WE WILL BE TRACKING. DURING THE HEARING ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WE HEARD FROM LABOR. ABOUT TYING THE INCREASE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CLICK TO BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH SO MANY OF THE COUNTIES. AND I AM SURE WILL BE HEARING FROM THEM AS WELL. AND I WOULD ASK THAT THAT THAT BE LOOKED AT IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. OKAY NEXT ITEM. THE NEXT ITEM IS IS REALLY WHAT WE VIEW AS A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM WE THINK IN THE EFFORTS TO REUNIFY FAMILIES IT'S THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME -- THERE WAS A I BELIEVE IN A PRIOR HEARING AND I ADVOCATE REQUEST -- FOR FOR FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY AND BUY G. YOU'RE THE MAY REVISION DOES NOT INCLUDE THAT BUT WHAT IT DOES INCLUDE IS THIS PROPOSED LANGUAGE -- HERE THAT WOULD ALLOW UNSPENT FUNDS FROM THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET AXE TO ROLL FORWARD AND BE AVAILABLE IN BUDGET YEAR. FOR PURPOSES OF THE PROGRAM. WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS BROUGHT UP IT WAS A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM AND WE EXPECT TO DURING THE BUDGET YEAR THAT THE EVALUATION OF THAT EFFORT WILL BE COMPLETED? WE COULD THANK YOU. THAT'S REYES PART OF FINANCE HI THIS IS JUST PURELY TACTICAL ADJUSTMENT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALREADY INCLUDED -- THE FUNDING FOR THIS IT JUST WASN'T A FORTUNE THIS -- THIS APP WHERE THE REVERBERATION LANGUAGE WASN'T INCLUDED. VERY GOOD THANK YOU NEXT ITEM. WELL THE NEXT ITEM -- IS LARGELY REFLECTED ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA -- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE WAS A PROPOSAL FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR LEGAL SERVICES FOR UNACCOMPANIED UNDOCUMENTED MINORS -- IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS AND ALSO -- PERSONS WHO ARE  PAST BENEFICIARIES OF IN FEDERAL TPF TEMPORARY. PROTECTED STATUS -- IN THE IN THE MAY REVISION WERE PROPOSING -- BAY BASED ON UTILIZATION OF THAT FUNDING POT TO REDUCE THAT TO FIVE MILLION AND USE THE OTHER FIVE MILLION. ALSO FOR A PURPOSE BUT DO A WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED FROM OUR LEGAL SERVICES CONTRACTORS AND EXPERIENCE HERE. IS THAT TO JUSTIFY AN ASYLUM PETITION OR OTHER IMMIGRATION REMEDIES OFTEN YOU HAVE TO SHOW EVIDENCE OF TRAUMA. AND THAT'S DONE THROUGH MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENTS SO WE'RE NOT. ENDING HERE -- TO TO DO TOO MUCH EXCEPT CONTINUE OUR EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE THE LEGAL REMEDIES THAT THEY NEED. OR OR THE INFORMATION TO SUPPORT THE LEGAL REMEDIES SO WE'RE PROPOSING FIVE MILLION -- BOTH FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THOSE APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS NAVIGATION SERVICES TO CONNECT. PEOPLE -- TO WHERE WHERE THOSE ASSESSMENTS CAN OCCUR -- AND WE WOULD BE DOING THAT OF COURSE THROUGH THE QUALIFIED NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHICH WE WHICH WE FUND -- TO SERVE THESE POPULATIONS. I THINK THE STATISTICS STATISTICS ARE CLEAR THAT IF YOU TRY TO GO. TO IMMIGRATION -- TO COURT. ON IMMIGRATION STATUS WITHOUT COUNSEL YOUR CHANCES OF SUCCEEDING ARE. VERY LOW SO -- THE COMMUNITY SINCERELY APPRECIATES THE GOVERNOR AGAIN -- STEPPING UP ON ON THAT ISSUE. TO IF I MAY MAKE THAT CONCRETE WE IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT WITHOUT COUNSEL ABOUT 15% OF CASES ARE SUCCESSFUL IN WITH COUNSEL THAT NUMBER'S CLOSER. TO NINE ZERO THAT IS TRUE. THANK YOU BYE MAKES A VERY LARGE DIFFERENCE IT DOES AND IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT INFORMATION AND THAT'S WHY THOSE. MENTAL ASSESSMENTS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- TO HAVE GREATER SUCCESS THEN YOU'RE ABLE TO PROVE THE PARTICULAR CASE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PROVE. WONDERFUL THANK YOU -- NEXT ITEM. THE NEXT ITEM IS THE FIRST ITEM ON PAGE SIXTEEN OF THE AGENDA APPRECIATE HAVING THE LANGUAGE RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF US -- THE AS A STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEMS ARE SAWS SYSTEMS ARE -- PROJECTS -- WHERE A LARGE PART OF THE FUNDING FOR THEM COMES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PENDING FEDERAL FUNDING DOCUMENTS AND SO IN THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT THEY WILL OR WANT TO PROVE AND THE TIMING OF THAT -- WE'RE PROPOSING SOME PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE HERE IN THE BUDGET WILL ALLOW ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT BOTH THE FEDERAL APPROVAL AS WELL AS WHAT SUBSEQUENTLY -- DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE APPROVED AS WELL AND YOU'LL SEE HERE THAT THERE'S NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE -- THE THIRTY DAY -- NOTICED IT TO THEM AS WELL SO THE LEGISLATURE'S INVOLVED IN THE REVIEW OF THOSE ADJUSTMENTS AS WELL -- WE DON'T SEE ANY ISSUES WITHTHAT -- NEXT ITEM THE NEXT ITEM IS SIMILAR TO THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME ITEM THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER HERE WERE AGAIN PROPOSING LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW -- PRIOR YOUR MONEY TO TO THAT HAS NOT BEEN SPENT TO BE RE APPROPRIATED FOR EXPENDITURE AND UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THAT HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM WITHIN CAL WORKS. THANK YOU NEXT ITEM -- BOTTOM OF SIXTEEN YEAH BOTTOM OF PAGE SIXTEEN THE CASH DISBURSEMENT AUTHORITY AGAIN. THAT -- BASICALLY WENT WHEN THERE'S A SHORTFALL OR A DISRUPTION IN THE COLLECTION OF FEDERAL OR OR COUNTY FUNDING WE HAVE SOME ABILITY TO DRAW FUNDS THAT WE CAN THEN -- FROM THE STATE TREASURY THAT WE CAN THEN REIMBURSE -- THOSE EXPENDITURES -- AND THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE ITSELF IS ON PAGE. SEVENTEEN OKAY -- LA -- ON ANY OF THE ADDITIONAL ITEMS THAT YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN ON OUR ROOM WITH REGARD TO THE LAST FEW ITEMS NO WE'VE WE'VE YOU THEN AS LARGELY TECHNICAL IN NATURE AND AND DON'T HAVE -- SPECIFIC COMMENTS -- I DID MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS ABOUT THAT THE NEW METHODOLOGY FOR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES WITHIN A SINGLE APPLICATION WHICH I BELIEVE IS ITEM FOUR ONE FIVE FROM A FEW MINUTES AGO -- WE POINT OUT THE NEW METHODOLOGY% TAKES PROMISING STEPS TO MORE ACCURATELY ASSESS THE CASE MANAGEMENT NEEDS OF OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN AND THE COW WORKS PROGRAM -- SO IN THAT SENSE WERE WERE -- GENERALLY SUPPORT OF OF OF THE DIRECTION THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE COUNTIES HAVE MOVED WITH THIS PROPOSAL I'M GOING FORWARD WE THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME KEY QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN OUTSTANDING -- ONE OF THE MAJOR ONES IS WHETHER OR NOT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN. SORT OF PROVIDING THIS CUSTOMIZE LEVEL OF FUNDING BASED ON THE THE NEED THAT INDIVIDUAL -- WELFARE TO WORK PARTICIPANTS OR OR CALPERS PARTICIPANTS HAVE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. FOR WHETHER WE'RE ASSESSING -- SORT OF THE STATE LEVEL AND BASING THE OVERALL BUDGET METHODOLOGY ON THAT SO THERE'S A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE THE STATE WIDE ALLOCATION THAT GOES OUT TO THE COUNTIES WILL BE REFLECTIVE OF THE BUDGET METHODOLOGY OR WHETHER THE BUDGET METHODOLOGY IS IS. STRICTLY A STATEWIDE VIEW AND THE ALLOCATION IS IS MADE. DISTINCT LATE -- BUT WILL BE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON ON THAT QUESTION AS THIS THIS NEW FUNDING METHODOLOGY SORT OF EVOLVED AND WE LEARN MORE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. EVERYTHING DEPARTMENT FINANCE WOULD LIKE TO ADD. I ALSO HAD A MISSED OPPORTUNITY TIME HOODS FARMING OF FINANCE JUST WANT TO MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT ABOUT THE HOME VISITING LANGUAGE THAT WAS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY -- FINANCE DOESN'T YET HAVE A POSITION ON THAT LANGUAGE WERE HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH THE ADVOCATES OF WRITTEN THAT LANGUAGE. HOWEVER WE WOULD HAVE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND -- ANY IMPLICATIONS FROM REMOVING THAT PRIORITIZATION -- BUT AGAIN WE WILL HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELL LET'S GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. MADAM CHAIR ROBERT HARRIS ON BEHALF SCA ARE YOU CALIFORNIA ARE FOR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES -- ON ISSUE FOR ELEVEN THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY ADMINISTRATION FUNDING WE SUPPORT THAT. ON ITEM FOR TWELVE THE EEVEE V.. MOVING FORWARD WHEN TOTAL SUPPORTER THAT THAT'S GOOD. IN. TERMS OF THE WRIST RESTS FOR THIRTEEN THE RESTORATION OF THE EARLIER ASKED IF THERE. WAS ANY OTHER. PROGRAMS WERE REYES WORK IS GIVEN TO DD AND THEN AND THEN A TREND OF TAKING OF THE WAY TO BE CLEAR A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE IN THE LATTER MEN SYSTEM ABOUT A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE ALSO GET AYE HSS. THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRESUPPOSING WHO GETS CUT WHEN A DOWNTURN HAPPENS. AND IT'S ALL IN THE HUMAN SERVICE AREA AND IT'S MOSTLY IN THIS PROCESS. OLD PEOPLE AND DISABLED PEOPLE AND THAT POPULATION. WAY BACK WHEN THESE CUTS WERE MADE [inaudible] WE AGREED. TO HELP RESTORE THOSE CUTS. BY HELPING PASSED THE MCO ATTACKS. AND WE DID THAT. BUT THAT LANGUAGE NEVER WENT AWAY. BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE TO HOLD IT OVER THE HEAD. A POOR AND DISABLED FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHERE THE CUTS COME THAT'S WHAT THE INDICATION OF THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THIS IS AND THAT'S WHERE THE INDICATION OF THE EXPIRATION DATE. OF THE DEVIKA. BRACES HAPPEN. SO WE TOTALLY OPPOSE THIS WEEK REJECT THE PREMISE. THAT HE PRESUPPOSES AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THAT THE CUTS HAPPEN THE POOR AND DISABLED PEOPLE IT'S WRONG IT'S IMMORAL AND IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY KINDLY THANK YOU.

SUCH THAT ARE PREGNANT WOMEN WHO ARE PRESUMPTIVELY ELIGIBLE FOR CAL WORKS BASED ON THEIR INCOME DO NOT HAVE TO WAIT.

GOOD EVENING WOULD DEPLORED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF BABY EVERY BUT OF FOR THE MOMENT REPRESENTING THE ARK OF CALIFORNIA. BUT I I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE SUN SETTING OF THE RATE. INCREASE -- AND IN DOING SO I'D LIKE TO USE BABY AREAS AN EXAMPLE VERY PROVIDE SUPPORTED LIVING SERVICES. OF THE TWO OF ABOUT EIGHTY PEOPLE WE EMPLOY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY OF INDIVIDUALS. AND FIGHTING IN AGES WORKER IS REALLY REALLY OF A CHALLENGE. SO -- LET'S SEE. STUFF TO ORDER WORK THOSE HOURS BECAUSE THE RATES ARE SO LOW. AND SO -- MOST REGIONAL CENTERS. MANY REGIONAL CENTERS ACTUALLY OF THE TELL US THAT THEY WILL NOT FUND THOSE HOURS EVEN IF. THE CLIENT WHO WITH OUR SYSTEMS CANNOT FIND A WORKER. AND SO THAT LEAVES THE BURDEN ON THE PROVIDER OF SERVICE. SO ADDED TO THE OTHER SUNSET WITH THE THE I. D. D. RATE INCREASE -- THIS IS VERY VERY OF IT'S IMPORTANT TO INCREASE THE RATES RIGHTEOUS US WORKERS SO THAT WE CAN FIND WORKERS. OF MY STUFF AS WE ARE JOINT EMPLOYERS CAN WORK I JUST AS ALWAYS BUT NONE OF THEM WANT -- TO BECAUSE THE RATE IS LESS. WHAT THAT DOES IS LEAVE THE PROVIDER WITH ONE TO THREE CHOICES NONE OF THEM ARE GOOD? OF THE FIRST ONE BEING THAT. WE PROVIDE THE HOURS WITHOUT FUNDING. AND WITHOUT A CONTRACT BE A PURCHASE OF SERVICE WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS. WHICH PUTS US IN OF GREAT LIABILITY. IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN DURING THOSE HOURS -- SECONDLY WE CAN LEAVE THE CAR IN ATTENDED. OF WHICH PUTS THEM AT RISK HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK. AND THEN ALSO WE ARE THEN TOLD THAT WERE ABANDONING OUR CLIENT. THIRD OPTION IS TO GIVE NOTICE A NOT PROVIDE THE SERVICE SO -- I WOULD SIMPLY REQUEST THAT YOU NOT ALLOW WITH THE RATE INCREASE TO SUNSET I DON'T GIVE YOU A FINAL EXAMPLE A HOUSEHOLD. WITH THREE INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING SERVICES FROM BABY VERY I DID HAVE TO GIVE NOTICE EVERY SINGLE MONTH ON BECAUSE WE COULD NOT FIND A WORKER FOR FIVE HUNDRED I AGES US HOURS.

LIKE TO RENEW OUR REQUEST. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO FIND FIRST THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM THE MODES MOBILE RESPONSE. FOR YOUTH IN THEIR CARE GIVERS WERE -- IN CRISIS WITH RESPECT -- TO THE ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION. WE APPRECIATE THE FUNDING OF ONE TIME -- ONE TIME FUNDING FOR EXISTING PROVIDERS AND RECIPIENTS BUT WE POINT OUT THAT THERE IS NO FUNDING. IN THE BUDGET ONGOING FOR NEW PROVIDERS AND NEW RECIPIENTS AND IT IS OUR BELIEF BASED ON OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COUNTY FOLKS WHO WERE ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM. THAT THE PROCESS IS JUST MORE COMPLICATED AND THE PEOPLE THAT WERE HELPING -- THE AB DIFFICULTY NAVIGATING THIS VERY COMPLICATED PROCESS -- AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ON WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE OF THE ON GOING. COSTS OF ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION WITH RESPECT THE CALVERTS EMPLOYMENT SERVICES WE ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE THE WORK ON THE NEW METHODOLOGY -- THERE'S ONE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE COUNTIES AND THAT IS HOW INTENSIVE NEED CASE WORK BE FOR CLIENTS WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS PEOPLE OF HAD DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OUR MEMBERS HAVE TOLD US BASED ON THE WORK WE'VE DONE AND CAL WORKS TO PLAY NOW THAT IT'S AT LEAST TEN HOURS A MONTH WITH THE BUDGET PROVIDES -- IS FIVE HOURS PER MONTH AND SO WE'RE SUGGESTING LANGUAGE THAT EXPRESSES LEGISLATIVE INTENT TO GET TO TEN HOURS PER MONTH. IN BUDGET YEAR PLUS -- ONE BUT WE ARE EXTREMELY THANKFUL FOR THE EXCELLENT WORK WE DID WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES -- WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE AGREE ON 90% OF OF WHERE WE NEED TO GO -- WITH RESPECT TO CHARACTER AND ALSO LIKE TO RENEW OUR REQUEST TO UPDATE THE EARNED INCOME DISREGARD TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEAVING CAL WORKS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO STAY OFF OF CAL WORKS. WE APPRECIATE THE ONE TIME INVESTMENT FOR CALIFORNIA ADMIN FOR SSI -- FOR SS I CASH OUT AND WE APPRECIATE FINANCING HERE TODAY THAT THE WORK WITH US SO THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF PREVENTING US FROM BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT -- CAO WORK STAGE ONE CHILD CARE TWELVE MONTHS CONTINUOUS THE ELIGIBILITY WE REALLY LIKE IT -- WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT PREMATURELY SEPARATING CAL WORKS STAGE ONE CHILD CARE FROM THE SINGLE ALLOCATION THAT FLEXIBILITY HAS BEEN PART OF THE PROGRAM FOR TWENTY YEARS. AND OUR BUDGETS. BEEN ADOPTED IN THE FISCAL YEAR STARTS JULY FIRST IT'S JUST TO SAY IT'S TOO LATE TO HAVE THE COUNTIES -- ADOPT A BUDGETING CHANGE OF THIS MAGNITUDE WITH SO LITTLE TIME SO WE'RE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO GIVE US A YEAR TO PHASE THAT IN SO AND BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE WE WOULD SEPARATE CHILD CARE FROM THE SINGLE APPLICATION. AND FINALLY I WOULD ASK THE THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY CONSIDER RE AUTHORIZING. EVEN ON A ONE TIME BASIS THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM THE BEEN A THOUSAND CHILDREN WHO'VE BEEN SAFE THE REUNIFIED WITH THEIR PARENTS BECAUSE OF THAT PROGRAM IT'S A PROGRAM THAT YOU PAY HALF THE COUNTIES PAY THE OTHER HALF. AND BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY EXTRAORDINARY HOUSING IT ON AFFORDABILITY. THIS IS A SERVICE THAT WE CANNOT SIMPLY FIND WITHIN OUR BASE LINE IT WAS JUST IT'S A PROBLEM THAT WE DID NOT ANTICIPATE WHEN WE DID OUR A REALIGNMENT. AND IT WOULD BE A SHAME IF COUNTIES HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN PROGRAMS WITH A THOUSAND PERSON WAITING LIST WHEN WE KNOW THAT THAT PROGRAM IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KIDS GOING HOME SAFELY WITH THEIR PARENTS WERE GROWING UP IN FOSTER CARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. BLOODY SANTOS ON BEHALF OF SCA YOU -- I WANT TO START BY ALIGNING MYSELF WITH THE COMP MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS PREVIOUSLY MADE BY MISTER MAC -- REGARDING THE AN AGENDA IZED NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR CAL FROM ASH ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION ENROLLMENT AND PANNED OUT -- BUT PROVIDING -- TO FOLKS IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS -- ALSO WANTED EXPRESSED SINCERE APPRECIATION TO THE COMMITTEE AND MISTER. THANK GOD FOR BRINGING UP THE TITLE FOR EASY WAY FOR EXPLORATION THAT WERE ANTICIPATING IN OCTOBER AND THE DRAMATIC IMPACT THAT'S GONNA HAVE ON COUNTIES AS WAS MENTIONED COUNTIES HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THIS AND HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATING THAT. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE ARE PREPARED PARTICULARLY IN A COUNTY LIKE I'LL A WHICH IS GOING TO HAVE BETWEEN A TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN MILLION AND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IT -- IT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE THAT SO WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE LANGUAGE THAT MISTER JOVANKA MENTIONED -- TO ANTICIPATE IN THE EVENT THAT THE FED STONE'S -- DON'T ADDRESS THAT SHORTCOMING -- I WANT TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH MANY OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY MISTER MAC UP -- I ALSO WANT TO RESPOND TO A QUESTION POSED BY THE CHAIR REGARDING THE DELTA THAT WE BELIEVE EXISTS BETWEEN THE ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION FOR RESOURCE FAMILY ASSISTANCE APPROVAL. I'M IN THE MAY REVISED -- THAT ADDRESSES EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TWENTY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL WE BELIEVE THAT THE REASON WHY WE HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN ADDRESSING THE BACKLOG. AND GETTING KIDS PLACED APPROPRIATELY IS BECAUSE WE DID HAVE THE TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED AND SO IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE. MAKING THAT SHORTFALL AND BACKLOG SMALLER THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO GIVE US THE FULL FUNDING ALLOCATION THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS NOT IN I CURRENT EIGHTEEN POINT -- FOUR ADDITION IN THE MAY REVISE AND SO WE'RE ASKING FOR AN ADDITIONAL SIX MILLION DOLLARS -- ALSO WANT -- TO EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE AMENDMENTS TO A COUPLE OF PROPOSALS THAT MISTER MAC ARE ALSO MENTIONED PARTICULARLY AS IT REGARDS AS IT RELATES TO THE TWELVE MONTH ADDITIONAL EXTENSION. FOR MOVING THE CHILD CARE OUT OF THE SINGLE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY AS HE MENTIONED -- WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIMING OF THAT -- SO TO PROVIDE US WITH THE ADDITIONAL TWELVE MONTHS WILL BETTER ENSURE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EFFECTUATE THAT -- WITHIN THE BUDGET CONFINES. ON WE ADDITIONALLY WANT TO EXPRESS -- OOPS I JUST POINT ON WHAT MY NEXT UNLESS -- I WILL SKIP NOW -- TO ALSO SAY THAT -- ON BEHALF OF KAPPA. HOME WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK THAT WAS ON UNDERTAKEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT -- TO GET TO A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE CORRECT FUNDING METHODOLOGY FOR ON PUBLIC AUTHORITIES WAS WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE TIME AND EFFORT THAT WAS PUT INTO ALL OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND WE'RE ALSO APPRECIATIVE OF THE ADDITIONAL -- BUDGET ALLOCATION IN THERE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. BUT I'M CHAIR MARTHA GUERRERO WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.

AND ON THE ONE TIME COUNTY ADMINISTRATION FUNDING FOR THE EXPANDED CALPERS POPULATION WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THAT BUT WE ARE PENDING. TO SUPPORT THAT IN ADDITION THAT IT BE ONGOING SO THE COUNTIES BE ALLOWED TO USE THE FUNDING WITHOUT OBTAINING PRIOR APPROVAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- END ON THE CAL WORD STAGE ONE ODD TWELVE MATILDA DEBILITY WE WILL BE.

GOOD EVENING CAM LEWIS REPRESENTING CHILDREN NOW AND PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE COW WORK SOME VISITING ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION IN ORDER. TO BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING YOU WANT TO PUT IN THERE AS WELL. I'M REGARDING THAT STAKEHOLDER TRAILER BILL WE HAVE AT IT THIS WAY A LOT OF FOLKS TO REALLY ENSURE THAT IT WOULD MAKE. FIRSTLY THERE IMPLEMENTATION AT THE COUNTY LEVEL IT IS NOT AN ENTITLEMENT AS WAS NOTED SO LOOK FOR THEIR CONVERSATIONS WITH FINANCE LATER THIS WEEK TO DISCUSS IN DETAIL -- WE ALSO SUPPORT STAGE ONE COW WORKS CONTINUOUS ELIGIBILITY -- AND THEN IF I SWITCH MY HAVE TO SPARE NAT AND WE JUST APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS COMMENTS -- FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO AROUND THE FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY SOCIAL WORKER INCREASED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF MARTY MODEM A FAMILY MEMBER ALSO WITH CITY CAN CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SENIOR COMMUNICATION NETWORK IN THE CALIFORNIA PERSON CENTERED ADVOCACY PARTNERSHIP. FIRST OF ONE IS THANK THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR BEING HERE SEVEN O'CLOCK AND I THINK LAST WEEK. HE ADJOURNED AT ALMOST NINE SO I DON'T KNOW FOR TRYING TO REACH BEAT THAT RECORD BUT BUT AGAIN. BUT A PERSON ANSWERS NO NO YEAH GOOD. I I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR BUT ALSO DO MINISTRATION FOR ITS EMPHASIS ON EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATION THOSE ARE ISSUES REALLY IMPORTANT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS -- AND SO THE EMPHASIS OF THOSE THINGS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES -- PART OF THE BUDGET IS IS IS IS APPRECIATED. ALSO WON A SUPPORT THE THE COMMENTS MADE BY FRANK MAC ON THE ISSUE OF E. V. V. ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION. I REALLY APPRECIATE A LOT OF US DO APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND HOW THEY WORK WITH ALL OF US. TO MITIGATE THE CONCERNS THAT A LOT OF US HAD ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EVEY V.. AND WE THINK THAT ANY ANY HELP IN TERMS OF RESOURCES TO FURTHER MITIGATE. ANY CONCERNS IS IS IS DOING THE RIGHT THING IS DOING THE THINGS THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD WOULD WANT TO SEE HAPPEN -- ALSO WANT TO MENTION SOMETHING IS NOT IN THE MAY REVISE AND IS JUST. WE'RE DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE WASN'T A A AN INCREASE IN THE S. S. P. GRANTS FOR PEOPLE ON SSI THIS IS P.. AND WE WOULD URGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER THAT LASTLY -- I JUST WANT TO MAKE OUR OPPOSITION TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS. A ON THE RESTORATION OF THE 7% -- ISA SAYS REDUCTION AND THAT IT WOULD GO INTO EFFECT OR THAT'S THE RESTORATION WOULD END DECEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE THINK THAT IS NOT RIGHT AND IT IS ALSO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE DURING THE BUDGET SURPLUS WE HAVE INCREASES AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. AND MY SISTER BY THE WAY RECEIVE MEDI CAL DEVELOPMENT -- SERVICES THE REGIONAL CENTER AND I JUST US DURING THE TIMES OF THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WHEN. THEIR WORK CUTS AND WE THERE WASN'T CERTAINLY CONSTANTLY IN MY FAMILY FIGHTING OFF THOSE CUTS HERE WE'RE IN A BUDGET SURPLUS IN EVEN WARMER GETTING INCREASES THERE'S A SUNSET. THAT. MAYBE THERE'S A JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT. BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE AT THIS POINT IN TIME. TO HAVE A RESTORATION OF A CUT THAT WAS MADE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION -- TO A POPULATION IS VERY VULNERABLE. BECAUSE THERE MAY BE A DOWNTURN IN REVENUES TWO YEARS FROM NOW WE THINK. THAT CUTS SHOULD BE HARD TO MAKE. AND THAT THE STATE IN THE LEGISLATURE DID MINISTRATION SHOULDGO TO A PROCESS TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER. A REDUCTION IF IT'S NECESSARY -- ONE OF THE THINGS IS REALLY DIFFICULT WITH THIS IS THAT THE CUT WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE EFFECT JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT WOULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ADVOCATES FOR FAMILIES. TO REALLY FIGHT THE REDUCTIONS ALL WE WOULD BE DOING IS FOR THE NEXT PREVIOUS YEAR IS TO BE WORRIED THAT WOULD THIS CUT HAPPEN OR NOT. AND THAT'S NOT FAIR I THINK WE CAN DO THE RIGHT THING NOT HAVE OF THIS -- YOU KNOW HAD THE RESTORATION PERMANENT AS AS THIS SUB ONE TOOK ACTION ON THAT EARLIER IN MARCH WE APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU REMEMBER WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BREAK THE RECORD FROM NO. I WAS JUST A LITTLE REMINDER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CRISTINA BOSS HAMILTON WITH YOU W. I I DON'T WANNA BE LABOR IT I I THINK THE THE POINT ON SON STUDYING. NOT IDEAL YOU KNOW THIS COMMITTEE TOOK INACTION IN MARCH WERE PLEASE JUST STICK WITH THAT ACTION IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO WE DON'T WANT TO BUY IN THE FUTURE LEGISLATURE. TO ENACT THE CUT IT YOU KNOW JUST LIKE MARTY SAID IT SHOULD BE REDUCE. DEBATED A NEW WINDOW WHEN THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT AND THAT'S THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO DO THAT AND THEN ALSO TO IT TO ANSWER REALLY QUICKLY. WE WE BEING THE UNIONS REPRESENTING I JUST SAYS ARE STILL LOOKING TO CONNECT THE REDUCTION IN THE COUNTY OF MAUI TO LOCAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND THAT IS STILL AN OUTSTANDING ASK THANK YOU. THANK YOU. A META CHECKER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND WE JUST LIKE TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH -- THE POSITION ON THE 7% TO RETREAT FROM THE 7% INCREASE -- THAT CERTAINLY GOES AGAINST I THINK THE NEED FOR THE STABILITY IN THE ON GOING FUNDING IN THIS PROGRAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING ANTI SHORTS WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RATES I JUST WANT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE DEPENDENCY A COUNCIL -- INCREASE AND ALSO ECHO ECHO I MISTER MARCUS COMMENTS ABOUT THE NEED TO REALLY FUND THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM BUT WANT TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ISSUE FOR A SEVEN PLACEMENT PRIOR TO APPROVAL -- WE APPRECIATE THE EXTENSION OF THE EMERGENCY CARE GIVER FUNDING FOR UP TO A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS BUT WE BELIEVE IT IS CRITICAL THAT THERE BE GOOD BECAUSE FOR THE ENTIRE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS NOT THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. THAT'S IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. RESEARCH FAMILY APPROVAL IS STILL TAKING ON AVERAGE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS AND SO THAT MEANS MANY MORE FAMILIES ARE TAKING MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS TO GET THROUGH RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL. GOOD CAUSE IS TRIGGERED UPON A FINDING BY THE DEPARTMENT THAT THE DELAY IS NEITHER THE CARE GIVER OR THE COUNTY'S FAULT. AND SO CUTTING FAMILIES OFF AT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS WHEN THAT'S NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN THAT IT'S TAKING LONGER TO GET THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS -- SEEMS PATENTLY UNFAIR WE DON'T THINK THE CHILDREN AND FAMILY SHOULD BE THE ONES THAT ARE BEARING -- THE BRUNT OF DELAYS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONTROL AND SO WE WOULD ASK THAT THE ENTIRE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAY GOOD BECAUSE BE MAINTAINED IN THE COMING YEAR THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND THE YOU HAD A ROBUST AGENDA DISCUSSED I'M PAUL JUDGE NO VANCE FOR THE NUMBER OF ITEMS I'M GOING TO RAISE -- SO -- ON THE SINGLE ALLOCATION WERE VERY HAPPY TO SEE THIS INCREASE IN FUNDING WE THINK IT'S WELL PLACE WELL USE WE WE BELIEVE IT'S GONNA BE NECESSARY AS WE EXPAND AND ENHANCE THE POWER SPERMS WE GO FORWARD -- HOME VISITING AGAIN WE'RE HAPPY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUTTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING INTO THAT BUT WE SUPPORT THE ADVOCATES PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THAT PROGRAM OUT TO DESTROY FAMILIES PARTICULARLY PREGNANT WOMEN AS THE PREVIOUS ADVOCATE MENTIONED -- WE SUPPORT THE TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY PROPOSAL ARE WE THINK IS THAT FOR A CRUCIAL DISABILITY FOR HOURS FAMILIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE CHILD CARE THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM ALL THE TIME WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUALLY GO BACK. AND TRY TO GET THAT. APPROVED AGAIN BY THE COUNTY. AND THEN -- BUT AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER -- YOU KNOW WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS PROPOSAL AGAIN TO INCREASE GRANTS FOR US THE SCIENCES BE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION. HERE TODAY ABOUT GRANT CUTS THEY'VE BEEN TAKING MANY YEARS AGO AND STILL NOT BEEN RESTORED AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE SINGLE LARGEST ONE THAT HAS NOT BEEN RESTORED -- WE DO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS AROUND THE SMB IN TMB LANGUAGE TO MAKE THAT -- TO GET RID OF THE LANGUAGE THAT MADE IT ONLY A TEMPORARY PROGRAM AND TO REMOVE THE LANGUAGE THAT BARRED THE ENTITLEMENT WE'RE STILL LOOKING FORWARD TO TALKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. ABOUT -- INSURING THAT -- WE DON'T -- WE CAN FIX RULES THAT MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO RETURN BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IN THE CALPERS PROGRAM. 25% OF THE CASELOAD TURNS OVER AT REED'S TERMINATION AND THEN LASTLY WE JUST KNOW THAT WE'RE STILL HOPING TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THE SIXTY MONTH TIME CLOCK FOR CAO WORKS. THE ASSET TAPS REMOVAL FOR CAL WORKS AND IN THE HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR CAL WORKS TO GET RID OF THE ONCE YOUR LIFETIME. A ONCE A YEAR REQUIRE A LIMIT AND TO ALLOW FOR THE SIXTEEN DAYS COULD BE USED IN -- CHUNKS AND NOT HAVE ALL -- SIXTEEN CONSECUTIVELY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JUST GARRETT I CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES -- TO START WITH THIS -- ONE REITERATE OUR GRATITUDE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S ISIS AND WE PROPOSAL ON IN PARTICULAR -- THAT IT'S THIS STATE GENERAL FUND COMMITMENT IS STRENGTHENING THE MAY REVISE ON WITH THE COST OF THE PROGRAM'S GOING OUT SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT ADDITIONAL STATE GENERAL FUND SO THAT COUNTIES -- HAVE FISCAL STABILITY MOVING FORWARD -- WE ALL SHE'LL -- WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE REQUEST TO LINK COLLECTIVE BARGAINING -- AND THE REDUCE INFLATION FACTOR WE KNOWS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ON THIS WITH THE ISLAND ARE REASONS IN THE LETTER I THINK WHAT I WOULD JUST ADD TO THE CONVERSATION TODAY IS IT. WE ARE SEEN -- INCREASING PROGRESS FROM COUNTIES ON LOCAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING NUMBER RECENT SURVEYS WE CONDUCTED SHOWED THAT. THERE'S BEEN EIGHTEEN NEW AGREEMENTS UNDER THE NEW MOE OTHERS TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING OR IN SOME FORM OF ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT -- WE HAVE THREE COUNTIES THAT HAVE THAT AGREEMENTS THAT PREDATE THE MOE. I HAVE A COUNTIES WHERE THE PROVIDING HAS NOT YET REACHED OUT TO START NEGOTIATIONS SO WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH COUNTIES AND ENCOURAGE ON THIS FRONT TO THE BEST WE CAN AND JUST DON'T THINK THE TIME IS RIGHT OR THE APPROACH IS RIGHT FOR A PUNITIVE MEASURE -- OUR PRINT OF APPROACH ON THIS ISSUE BUT I CERTAINLY -- REMAIN AS STRONGLY COMMITTED TO PARTNERING WITH -- THE LABOR ORGANIZATION ON THIS ISSUE THE GREAT PARTNERS ON ACCESS AND THINK IF THERE MAY BE SOME ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS IT DON'T TAKE THIS TYPE OF APPROACH TO IT -- OKAY -- OTHER ISSUES AS A LOT OF REALLY GOOD STRONG INVESTMENTS HERE -- ON THE CHILD WELFARE SIDE WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE INCREASE INVESTMENTS FOR FLIPPERS -- FOR THE RFA APPROVAL FOR PAYMENT AT TIME OF PLACEMENTS -- AND WE JUST ADVOCATE AND SIMILAR ITEMS TO MAKE OUTLINED FOR CONTINUE CONVERSATION ON THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF FUNDING THERE AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER GREAT INVESTMENTS -- IN NEED INVESTMENTS IN THE CHILD WELFARE FRONT. AMONG THE SINGLE APPLICATION WE APPRECIATE THE INCREASE FUNDING FOR THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES COMPONENTS. ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE THE APPROACH TO TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY AND I'M. FOR THE CHILD CARE COMPONENT AND WOULD JUST REITERATE THE CONCERNS ABOUT -- THE WRAPPING THIS WITH WHICH THAT CHANGE -- TO AT SIX SIGNALING OUT THAT -- COMPONENT WOULD COME UP AND JUST ASK -- FOR THE THE ONE YEAR EXTENSION OF THE ONE YEAR DELAY SO THAT COUNTIES GONNA PURPOSELY BUDGET MANAGE THAT A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT -- ON DISASTER DEFINITELY APPRECIATE -- THE THE COMMITMENT TO INCREASE RESOURCE FOR THE PARMA SOCIAL SERVICES IN ORDER TO APPROPRIATELY RESPOND AND PARTNER WITH COUNTIES IN THE AND HIS OFFICE SITUATIONS -- BUT WOULD ALSO REITERATED SUPPORT FOR A DEFINING RELATED TO CAL FOR ASH SO THAT -- THAT CAN BE AUTOMATED DISASTER HOW FRESH -- AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND THE LAST THING -- ON THE A CHILD A CAL FRESH EXPANSION -- WE WE APPRECIATE AND I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE INCREASE pADMINISTRATION AND THE OPENNESS -- TO MODIFYING THE LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTIES CAN USE THIS FUNDING AS EFFICIENTLY AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU I DO HAVE A QUESTION YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE MORE COUNTIES THAT NOW HAD COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. HOW MANY COUNTIES ARE LEFT WITHOUT A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT YES SO THERE ARE -- TWENTY ONE COUNTIES WITH THE CURRENT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT ALL THE COUNTIES WHERE IT'S NOT A CURRENT AGREEMENT THERE'S STILL PAIN. THE WAGE FROM THE LAST -- AGREEMENTS AND YOU KNOW FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM COUNTY IS THERE ABSOLUTELY CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE -- IN GOOD FAITH -- ON THESE AGREEMENTS TO CARRY OUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES THE STATE HAS MANDATED UPON COUNTIES. AND WE ARE REALLY SEEN -- PROGRESS MOVING FORWARD I THINK. THE LAST TWO YEARS COUNTIES WERE NEGOTIATE UNDER REALLY AYE LOOMING FISCAL CLIFF WITH A REALIGNMENT WITH THE CURRENT ACCESS FISCAL STRUCTURE AND NOW HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY -- OF THE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WERE COUNTIES WILL HAVE A MUCH MORE STABILITY AND I SAYS COSTS. AS WELL AS THE OPTION TO PREVENT CUTS TO HEALTH THE MENTAL HEALTH WE I REALLY BELIEVE WE'LL SEE -- THAT THIS PROGRESS CONTINUE EVEN MORE SO THEY WERE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES THAT DO HAVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. YES CURRENT DEBT. THAT HAVE YEAH THAT THE GREEN IT'S EXTEND YOU KNOW IF THEY IF THEIR EXPIRE THEY CONTINUE TO PAY -- THE WEIGHT OF THE LAST AGREEMENT BUT YES IN TERMS OF THE THE DATES OF THE AGREEMENT THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWENTY ONE COUNTY CS FIFTY EIGHT ONLY TWENTY ONE HAVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS YES HELLO.

JACQUI RETIRED SO THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES AND I'VE FIRST ONE IS STATE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR READING ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO'S COMMENTS -- WE APPROVE OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THERE OF COURSE WERE DISAPPOINTED NOT TO BE IN THE MAY REVISED BECAUSE FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF CONTINUUM OF CARE.

AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ON GETTING RID OF THE RFA BACKLOG BUT WE CANNOT NOT SUPPORT THIS PIECE THAT IS SO CRITICAL AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES NOW. BUT I BELIEVE WE HAVE A CLOSE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM IN THE COUNTIES AND TO NOT OF PROVIDE FOR THIS AN ADEQUATE PAY FOR THE SOCIAL WORKERS TO COMPLY NOT JUST WITH THE MINIMUM LAW. BUT TO ALSO CARE FOR THE FAMILIES THAT RELY ON THE STABILITY OF THE SOCIAL WORKER. THAT IS THE PIECE THAT NEEDS TO BE SECURE AND I KNOW YOUR SISTER HAS A PHD IN SOCIAL WORKER AND I KNOW WITH THE HEARING YOU STRONGLY SAID HOW SOCIAL WORKERS RUN THE RUN THE WORLD -- NOT QUITE SURE LET'S WORK DO DO YOU GOT SOURCES SAID THEY DO GOD'S WORK THEY DO -- ALSO 85% OF SOCIAL WORKERS ARE WOMEN.

AND SUPPORTS THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES THAT IS MUCH NEED FOR THEM TO CONTINUE -- MAINTAINING THE NEEDS THEY HAVE TRANSPORTATION CHILDCARE AND OTHER NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE EMPLOYMENT SO. WITH THAT JUST WANT TO ADD ANOTHER -- FIGURE WHICH IS THAT FOURTEEN THOUSAND CAL WORKS FAMILIES ARE HOMELESS. AND SO THIS DONE WITH THE COST OF LIVING IS VERY EXPENSIVE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND WE NEED TO DO ALL WE CAN. TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE SUPPORT TO MAINTAIN A STRONG STABLE -- WORK YOU KNOW -- THERE FOR THE ABILITY TO WORK AND AND YOU KNOW GET THEM BACK ON THEIR FEET THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU.

SEVEN BEFORE WE GO TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A FIVE MINUTE BREAK ALL RIGHT. ISSUE NUMBER. EIGHT TRAILER BILL PROPOSALS FOR DSS. BEGIN WHEN YOU LIVE. WELL. AS MAKING SURE IT WASN'T NINE THIRTY APOLOGIES. OF THE THESE THREE ITEMS A RELATIVELY STRAIGHT FORWARD -- LAST LAST YEAR A BILL WAS CHAPTER THAT ALLOWED AND COLLECTIBLE CAL WORKS DEBT TO BE TO BE WRITTEN OFF -- IN IN THE DRAFTING OF THAT LANGUAGE -- DO WE USE THE TERM -- EXPUNGE -- THAT THAT IS USED IN IN TERMS OF DUMPING OFF OLD EXPIRED AB T. BALANCES AND CREATED SOME CONFUSION WERE SIMPLY PROPOSING AND AND THIS. TRAILER BILL TO REPLACE THE WORD EXPUNGE WITH JUST CHARGE. TO TO LET GO THOSE OBLIGATIONS US RELATIVELY TECHNICAL. THE OTHER THING WE MESSED WHEN IT WHEN THE SESSION FINISH LAST YEAR AND THIS LIES WITH THE DEPARTMENT AS AS AS WELL -- IF YOU WERE WHEN WE THOUGHT ABOUT -- HOW HOW THAT DISCHARGE PROCESS PROCESS SHOULD GO -- YOU KNOW CLIENTS -- ALTHOUGH MANY STAY WHERE THEY ARE THEY ALSO MOVE AROUND IN WITH IT BECAUSE WE HAVE THREE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE CONSORTIUMS THERE'S NO. PRACTICAL WAY FOR PEOPLE TO EASILY WITHOUT MAKING A LOT OF PHONE CALLS ARE HAVING REALLY SUPER ACCESS O MULTIPLE COMPUTERS WHICH WE DON'T DO -- TO TO TAKE A STATEWIDE LOOK AT THE DEBTS OWED BY A CAL WORKS CLIENT TO SEE HOW LONG AND WHERE THOSE DEBTS WORKER.

OKAY ROSELLI -- WERE ACTIVELY LOOKING INTO THIS -- TRAILER BILL IT JUST RECENTLY CAME OUT SO WE'RE STILL READING IT WHILE I'M.

WITH APOLOGIES FOR THE TITLE OF THE ISSUE -- THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FUNDS REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT PROGRAMS -- AND THEY GENERALLY DO THAT BY PROVIDING FUNDING TO STATES WHO THEN ALLOCATE THEM THROUGH COUNTIES TO TO THE SERVICE PROVIDERS -- WENT WHEN THAT PROGRAM IT'S BEEN OVER TWENTY YEARS OR ROUGHLY TWENTY YEARS AT THIS POINT WAS CREATED -- THERE THERE WAS A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT THAT THE FEDS FUNDED DIRECTLY IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA -- PURSUANT TO A LEGISLATION AUTHORED BY MEMBER THEN MEMBERS -- WILSON AND FISH -- THAT ALLOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DIRECTLY FUND THAT PILOT PROGRAM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INDICATED TO US RECENTLY THAT -- AS OF OCTOBER ONE THEY NO LONGER WANT TO CONTINUE THAT DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT BUT FOR A PROJECT AND INSTEAD WOULD BE PROVIDING THE FUNDS TO THE STATE TO CONTINUE IT. AND SO WE'RE REQUESTING TRAILER BILL AUTHORITY THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO CONTRACT DIRECTLY -- AS THE FEDS HAVE DONE WITHOUT NONPROFIT PROVIDER -- AGAIN IN COORDINATION WITH THE COUNTY AND THE COUNTIES PLANNED FOR SERVING REFUGEES. BUT ALLOWING US -- TO TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE NONPROFIT HELLO [inaudible] PUBLIC FINANCE. OKAY. THE NEXT ITEM. AND THE RAPID RESPONSE RESERVE THIS IS THE FIVE MILLION CURRENT YEAR AND THEN THOSE LAWS LANGUAGE WOULD APPLY TO THE TWENTY MILLION AND BUDGET YEAR LAYS OUT THE OF HER PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE AND MAKES THEM AVAILABLE FOR A THREE YEAR PERIOD -- TO TO ASSIST -- VARIOUS ENTITIES -- IN IN OUR MERCHANT IMMIGRANT SITUATIONS THIS IS WHAT'S YOU'D BEING USED TO FUND -- HEALTH SCREENINGS AND REFUGEES I'M SORRY IMMIGRANT SERVICES -- TRANSPORTATION ON WORDS THE THE SHELTERING OF OF THEM ALL WELL THEY FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING -- REALLY IMPORTANT ONE THAT WITH THE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALREADY TODAY YES. VERY GOOD LA YOU [inaudible] FROM FINANCE. ALL RIGHT WE WILL [inaudible] PUBLIC COMMENT. BOB MADAM CHAIR MY CAROL AGAIN WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- BUT JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS -- ONE IS WE SUPPORT THE FIRST ITEM THE THE CHANGES TO SB -- SEVEN TWENTY SIX WE THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE WE ARE FINE WITH THAT -- I JUST OF I'M GOING TO TAKE BACK MY EARLIER REMARKS ABOUT THE SS I CASH OUT CLEAN UP LANGUAGE -- IN READING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IT'S POSTED ON THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES WEBSITE. I DON'T THINK IT DOES EITHER THING I DON'T THINK IT. FOR IT DOESN'T PROVIDE FOR AN ENTITLEMENT TO AID AND IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT IT -- DOESN'T CONTINUE TO SUBJECT THE PROGRAM TO AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO REVIEW THAT WHEN WE CAN BE IN TOUCH WITH THE COMMITTEE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE THINK THAT LANGUAGE ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHES -- THE PURPOSES AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT I WAS ABLE TO REVIEW QUICKLY THE HOUSING DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM LANGUAGE -- THIS SEEMS TO BE A RATHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM WHAT THE LEGISLATURE AGREED -- TO SOME TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO I MEAN AGAIN I THINK WE WOULD WANT TO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO TALK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE COMMITTEE. AND MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING THERE IS IS STILL CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL INTO THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING THE START BECAUSE WITH THE COOPER GROUP ON BEHALF OF CATHOLIC CHARITIES IN SUPPORT OF ITEMS NUMBER EIGHT AND NINE THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK ESPECIALLY TO DSS THE VERY GOOD. IF I MAY CHAIRED JUST MAYBE MY MISSED OPPORTUNITY AS WELL IF IF I COULD GIVEN THE INTEREST IN THE AUTOMATION OF THE DISASTER CALIBRATION ISSUE THAT MISTER MAC I MENTIONED THE NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND WITH MATCHING FEDERAL FUNDS -- I I WOULD ALSO JUST POINT OUT ACROSS THE BOARD ON LEGISLATION AND BUDGET ITEMS -- BECAUSE OF THE MIGRATION OF THE SYSTEMS FROM THREE TO TWO THREE THREE SYSTEMS TO ONE SYSTEM. THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE EXISTING BUDGET EVEN FOR CHANGES TO BE MADE. AND SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AREAS AS YOU SAW WITH OUR OWN PROPOSAL AROUND OVER PAYMENT COLLECTIONS WE'RE WE'RE SUGGESTING THAT DATES BE PUSHED OUT. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THAT HAPPENED FOR DISASTER CAL FOR ASH BUT I WOULD SIMPLY SUGGEST THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CONVERSATION AROUND ANY ITEM THAT IMPACTS SAWS AND POTENTIALLY REQUIRES AUTOMATION -- THAT EITHER THERE'D BE A PRIORITY EVEN -- CLEARLY STATED. FOR IT IT HE ITS INCLUSION IN A PARTICULAR YEAR TO THE EXTENT THAT'S POSSIBLE AND I WOULD NEED A BEER. OF COURSE INCLUSIVE OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COUNTY -- CONSORTIA THAT OPERATE THOSE SYSTEMS. EITHER TO AUTOMATED OR TO CONSIDER THAT THE COST OF THE WORKER TIME TO DO MANUAL WORK AROUNDS FOR THOSE THINGS OR WHETHER IT DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION DATE IS A MORE FEASIBLE APPROACH. SO IS A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED THE OTHER OPTION IS TO ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR A PURPOSE. AND ASK FOR IT TO BE DONE WHEN IT'S FEASIBLE TO DO SO AT ANY IN THE ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDS MAKE THEM AVAILABLE FOR A MULTI YEAR PERIOD. SO IN IN THE INTERESTS OF OF BEING ASSISTIVE -- I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO BE CONFUSED BY REMARKS AROUND SAWS SOME THINGS LIKE GRANT INCREASES ARE JUST REPLACING NUMBERS AND TABLES ON THOSE DON'T REALLY REQUIRE CHANGES -- BUT OTHER THINGS ARE MORE COMPLEX -- AND MAY REQUIRE SOME TIME SO I'M JUST LAYING OUT SOME CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE. ADDITIONALLY. THERE'S AS YOU KNOW A VERY LARGE VOLUME. OF ITEMS BOTH FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND FROM OTHERS ASKING FOR CONSIDERATION IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND WE SIMPLY WANT TO PLACE HOLD THAT IT TAKES PEOPLE TO GET SOME OF THOSE THINGS DONE. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE COME TO AN AGREEMENT AROUND THE FINAL PACKAGE THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN HAVING A CONVERSATION. AROUND POSITIONS ARE CONTRACT DOLLARS OR WHATEVER IS APPROPRIATE TO ACTUALLY AFFECTS YOU IT THOSE PROPOSALS SO I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT REMARK ON THE RECORD AND I APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE AT THE END OF A LONG HEARING. SHARE THOSE COMMENTS ON THE KILL FRESH'S AND POSTAL MADAM TERRIFY CAM THIS IS A VERY VERY BRIEF -- LAST SORT OF PERSONAL NOTICE I JUST WANT TO THANK YOUR LEADERSHIP AS CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE THIS YEAR THIS IS PROBABLY OUR LAST TIME WE'RE GOING TO BE APPEARING THIS YEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE.

PARTICULARLY THIS TIME OF YEAR WHEN THINGS ARE COMING AT THE VERY FAST AND FURIOUS -- AS WAS THE LA -- AND AND OTHERS BUT IT YOU THE WORK THAT THEY DO IS TRULY TRULY APPRECIATED AND WE APPRECIATE THEIR PARTNERSHIP.
