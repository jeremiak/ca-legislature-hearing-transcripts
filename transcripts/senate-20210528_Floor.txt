TWENTY SEVEN WILL HAVE SUPPORT OUR FARMERS AND OUR LAND MANAGERS. IN MANAGING THEIR LANDS TO HELP STORE CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE IN OUR SOILS CAL IT MAKES CALIFORNIA MORE RESILIENT TO CLIMATE IMPACTS AND I'M SURE MANY OF YOU KNOW. OUR SOILS ARE IN EFFECT LIVING ENTITIES BANDS THE MICROORGANISMS IN THE SOIL CCAP THE CAPACITY TO STORE A GREAT DEAL OF CARBON IF THEY'RE MANAGED IN A WAY THAT- DOES THAT AND SO OBVIOUSLY IT IS ONE OF THE SIMPLER WAYS TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS IT'S JUST BY MAXIMIZING THE ABILITY. OF OUR SOILS TO STORE CARBON SPECIFICALLY SP TWENTY SEVEN DIRECTS OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND OUR AIR RESOURCES BOARD. TO SET GOALS FOR THIS SEQUESTRATION FROM NATURAL WORKING LANDS AND ESTABLISHES A VOLUNTARY REGISTRY OF SEQUESTRATION PROJECTS AT THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH.

TO MAKE PRIVATE DOLLAR INVESTMENTS FOR OUR HARD WORKING FARMING AND RANCHING FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE STATE FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE ADOPTING NEW LAND MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES SUCH AS ADDING COVER CROPS FOR PLANTING REGENERATIVE COTTON THAT LEAD TO MULTI BENEFIT ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES. THAT DATA IS CLEAR THAT NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS STRATEGIES CAN INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CARBON PULLED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE IN ORDER TO MITIGATE CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS. EMISSIONS AND IMPROVE CLIMATE RESILIENCE THIS COULD CLIMATE CHANGE SOLUTION EMBRACES THE ROLE OF FARMERS RANCHERS AND LAND MANAGERS AS RESPONSIBLE STEWARDS OF OUR STATE AND HELPS TO MAINTAIN OPEN SPACE AND WORKING LANDS AS PART OF CALIFORNIA'S CULTURAL HISTORY.

THERE ARE FARMERS- DO A LOT IN THE AREA WE TALK ABOUT CARBON SEQUESTRATION AND WE OFTEN DON'T THINK ABOUT.

MEMBERS RIGHT TAKE A PILOT MODEL SIX AFTER THIS ONE OF FOUR IS CENTER ALLEN SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL EIGHTY THREE BY SENATOR ALAN AND ACTUALLY TO COASTAL SERVER RESOURCES. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS- SEALEVEL RISE THREATENS TO ERODE CLIFFS AND FLOOD HOMES ALONG THE ENTIRETY OF THE SET OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST. FROM NORTH TO SOUTH R. ELLIE- ESTIMATES AROUND EIGHT TO TEN BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF EXISTING PROPERTY IN CALIFORNIA. IS LIKELY TO BE UNDER WATER BY TWENTY FIFTY AND MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION IN PROPERTY COULD BE AT RISK OF FLOODING BY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED BY. TWENTY ONE HUNDRED. SO THIS IS ACTUALLY CAUSING A POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL CRISIS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY HAVE LIMITED BUDGETS- BUT THEY ALSO HAVE HOMEOWNERS WHO WANT THEIR CITY GOVERNMENTS TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE. TO PROTECT THEIR HOMES AND THEY'RE NOW SPENDING MORE AND MORE MONEY. ON MITIGATION. SO IN AREAS ALREADY EXPERIENCING FLOODING BUYING OUT LOCAL RESIDENTS AND RELOCATING THEM HAS BEEN VERY CONTROVERSIAL IN SOME INSTANCES. COST PROHIBITIVE. OF COURSE BUILDING SEA WALLS IS NOT JUST EXPENSIVE AS THE ANALYST- AS THE INOTES FOR NOW SAYS YOU CAN CHECK OUT POINTS OUT IF IT COMES WITH SEVERE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND OF COURSE. IT'S A IT'S A- TO REALLY- IMPOSSIBLE FIGHT TO WIN AGAINST THE C. SO THESE ARE SOME TOUGH CHOICES- BUT WE'RE- SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL IS PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH AN INNOVATIVE FINANCING OPTION TO ALLEVIATE THE REST OF C. LEVEL RISE WHILE PROTECTING BOTH PROPERTY OWNERS AND TAXPAYERS. IT BASICALLY STOP WHICH IS A REVOLVING LOAN FUND FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BUY PROPERTIES THAT WILL BE THREATENED IN A DECADE OR TWO. AND THEN IT ALLOWS THE OWNERS. TO SELL WHILE THE HOUSE IS STILL HAS VALUE AND THEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CAN THEN RENT OUT THE PROPERTY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VERY VIABLE PROPERTIES OFTEN TIMES IT CAN BE RENTED AT A VERY HIGH AND- AMOUNT. AND THE IDEA IS THAT THAT WILL THEN REPAY THE LOAN AND POTENTIALLY EVEN EARN REVENUE OVER TIME. AND THEN WHEN THE RISK. OF FLOODING FROM RISING SEA LEVELS GETS TO AND- AND UNBEARABLE POINT THE HOUSE COULD BE DEMOLISHED OR RELOCATED WITHOUT LOCAL RESIDENTS. OR TAXPAYERS BEARING THE COST.

THANK YOU I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SP FIVE FIVE NINE THE STATE WATER RESILIENCY ACT. AS I SAID BEFORE WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF A GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS. AND WE ARE ALSO NOW. ON THE VERGE AN ENTRY IN A WATER CRISIS THAT REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION ONE THAT COULD FIND YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND MINE THE ONLY SEARCHING FOR FOOD BUT ALSO SEARCHING FOR WATER. AS PRICES GO UP IN RESPONSE TO THE DECREASED WATER ACCESS AN INCREASED COST IN GETTING FOOD WORKS GOING FROM FARMS TO GROCERY STORES AND EVENTUALLY. OUR DINNER TABLES SP FIVE FIVE NINE CAN HELP PREVENT THIS. LAST SESSION I INTRODUCED A BILL OF THE SAME NUMBER THE REQUESTED FUNDING TO RESTORE THE CARRYING CAPACITYOF THE FRANK KERN CANAL. THAT BILL WAS ULTIMATELY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR BUT STARTED A LARGER CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW AND WHERE WE SHOULD BE SPENDING MONEY WHEN WE HAVE IT. TO REPAIR MUCH NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN BETTER PREPARE US FOR OUR WATER NEEDS AND DROUGHT AND NON DROUGHT YEARS. IN RECENT DECADES THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE WISE DECISIONS TO INVEST IN REPAIRING OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE. INCLUDING IN THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE PREPARATION OF OVER ONE BILLION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW BAY BRIDGE BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND OAKLAND. THOUGH THE BRIDGE WAS DELAYED OPENING AND CAUSE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED TO COST THE STATE MOVED FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT BECAUSE AS ONE OF THE MOST HEAVILY TRAVELED BRIDGES IN OUR STATE. IT WAS NECESSARY TO REPAIR AND PROVIDED A NET BENEFIT FOR THE ENTIRE STATE TO DO SO. AN INVESTMENT IN OUR FAILING WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM IS NO LESS IMPORTANT TO OUR STATE AND TO ALL OF US THAT LIVE HERE. WE GROW CROPS THAT FEED THE WORLD. BUT THIS IS NOT JUST FOR AGRICULTURE. THIS WATER IS USED BY RESIDENTS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND URBAN USERS AMAZON JEALOUS. APPROXIMATELY THIRTY ONE MILLION OF THEM. SOME OF WHOM LIVE IN OUR STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THIS WATER ALSO PROTECTS THE LARGEST REMAINING WETLAND COMPLEX IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. WHICH IS HOME TO OVER ONE MILLION MIGRATING BIRDS AND IS RECOGNIZED AS A WETLAND OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE. HOWEVER WITH THAT BEING SAID. LET'S NOT DISCOUNT THE IMPACT THE SLEEVES LEGISLATION WILL HAVE ON OUR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY EITHER. FARMING CONTRIBUTES ABOUT FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY EVERY YEAR AND THAT'S WITHOUT ACCOUNTING FOR ECONOMIC IMPACT ON FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE STATE. IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE RECOGNIZED OUR STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND HAVE ACTED TO ENSURE THE STAY STRONG. SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALLOCATED ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO THE FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION STRUCTURE THOSE PRODUCTION STAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLIONDOLLARS A YEAR AND I SUPPORT IT WE NEED THOSE JOBS IN OUR STATE. BUT JUST LIKE HOLLYWOOD CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY IS A WORLD LEADER. THREE OF THE FOUR LARGEST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE IN MY SENATE DISTRICT. WE NEED THE JOBS THAT THESE THAT THIS INDUSTRY SUPPORTS TO. PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY CALIFORNIA NEEDS THE FOOD BUT THIS INDUSTRY PRODUCES. BUT THE NATION NEEDS THIS FOOD AND THE WORLD NEEDS THIS FOOD SP FIVE FIVE NINE PROVIDES US THE OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY TO PLAN FOR FUTURE BUT YOU PROTECTED AS WELL THE BILL REQUEST SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND CANAL CONVEYANCE REPAIRS OVER THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS. THAT WILL PROVIDE A NET BENEFIT TO THE ENTIRE STATE.

AND EVEN MORE RARELY DO WE HAVE BILLS THAT BECOME NONPARTISAN. SP FIVE FIVE NINE HE IS. IN THE LATTER IT IS SO IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES OUR OUR WATER SUPPLY OUR DRINKING WATER SUPPLY OUR AGRICULTURE IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE THE SP FIVE FIVE NINE IS A NONPARTISAN. A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT I WHOLE HEARTEDLY SUPPORT. WE HAVE SEEN THE DEVASTATION THAT IS HAPPENING WITH THIS DROUGHT. AND JUST THIS WEEK THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES IDENTIFIED ANOTHER ZERO ALLOCATION. FOR FEDERAL WATER ON TOP OF THE- MEASLY 5% ALLOCATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AT THE STATE LEVEL. ALL OF THESE CUTBACKS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS OUR CURRENT BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO CAPTURE WHAT WATER WE DO HAVE IMPROPERLY CONVEY IT ACROSS THE STATE. THE FRANKLIN CANAL IN THE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN LA AND ELSEWHERE THIS IS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN TO INVEST IN CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE. THE PRO TEM'S. I PLAN TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S PLAN TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE SO IF WE DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE. TO RELY ON WHAT OUR GRANDPARENTS DID IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF OUR FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO INVEST NOW WE SHOULD HAVE DONE IT DECADES AGO WITH THIS MOMENT HAS ARRIVED IN IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT SB FIVE FIVE NINE BECAUSE- THIS WATER IS ESSENTIAL. NOT JUST FOR TOMORROW BUT THE DAY AFTER IN THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA COLLEAGUES I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE IN EITHER ON SP FIVE FIVE NINE. THANK YOU CENTER BORJA SENATOR NELSON. LADIES AND- IN THE SENATE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. I HAVE LIVED MY WHOLE LIFE FORMING BOTH EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE SANDIGANBAYAN AND THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY. I FEEL IN THE RAVAGE OF SUBSIDENCE AND WHAT IT IS. HAS OCCURRED TO. THE CONVEYANCE SYSTEM OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT. FURTHER A EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND THE FAILURE OF THE SPILLWAY. AT OROVILLE DAM. THAT'S WHERE THE STATE WATER PROJECT ORIGINATES WHERE THE WATER COMES FROM. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVING TO BE EVACUATED WHY. BECAUSE THE DAM FOR FIFTY YEARS HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY MAINTAINED. NO THAT'S STARTING TO HAPPEN IN FACT AS WE ARE SPEAKING RIGHT NOW I'M MISSING PARTICIPATION ON THE CITIZENS ADVISORY COMMISSION THERE ARE REAL THERE. STATUTE THAT YOU SUPPORTED HERE THAT WE PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO TO ENSURE THAT THE CITIZENS OF THE AREA. WERE ENGAGED AND INVOLVED WITH THE AGENCIES OF STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT THE DAM WAS MAINTAINED AND REPAIRED AS IT NEEDED TO BE SO IT DID NOT FAIL. AND ONE THAT FAIL. OUR WHOLE SYSTEM. THE SENATORS WRITE THIS AFFECTION ALL OF CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE GREAT FRUSTRATIONS IS THE AGENCIES OF STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHER INTERESTS. HAVE INCESSANTLY OVER THE DECADES DONE EVERYTHING THEY COULD DO TO STOP THE REPAIRING OF OUR WATER PROJECTS. TO STOP THEM. AND IN FACT. IT'S A SAD FACT. SEVEN YEARS AGO WE PASSED A WATER BOND. THAT ALLOWED THE SUBSTANTIAL MONEY TO BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR LARGE SURFACE STORAGE. BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF AGENCIES AND OTHER ENTITIES SEVEN YEARS LATER. WE HAVE NOT STORED ONE GALLON. BUT WHAT. IN THE THROES OF ANOTHER DROUGHT. THAT'S PART OF THE EQUATION WE HAVE NOT ADDRESSED THE EXCESSIVE REGULATION AND LITIGATION. BETTER STILL IMPEDED. BUT KEEP IN MIND ANOTHER THING THE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE- WATER PLAN OF CALIFORNIA FOR ALL OF US. YOU THINK THIS SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY. BUT IN THE SAME YEAR THAT THE BOND PASSED. I WAS ABLE TO GET INCORPORATED. AND TO BOTH THE BOND AND THE NEW STATE WATER POLICY OF CALIFORNIA. THE HUMANS HAD A WATER RIGHT. NOW YOU WOULD THINK THAT SUCH NONSENSE WHY WOULD WE EVER EVEN THINK OF THAT. HISTORICALLY THAT WAS A GIVEN. THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED. OVER THREE DECADES. HUMAN WATER RIGHTS WERE EVEN IF ANYTHING GREATLY DIMINISHED. AND NOW THAT IS A PART OF OUR POLICY AND COMMUNICATION. FROM THIS LEGISLATURE RELATED TO REQUEST AUDIT DISTINCT IT THIS WEEK. THAT HUMANS HAVE WATER. AND THERE IS NO WATER FOR HUMANS UNLESS WE MAINTAIN OUR STORAGE AND A CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS. THAT'S WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT BILL. AND I MUST INDICATE IT'S NOT A ONE TIME THING THIS HAS GOT TO BE SUSTAINED OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. IT ALSO HELPS ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM OF SUBSIDENCE. HOW BY PROVIDING THAT WATER CONVEY TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT. ONE OF THEM CAN BE INJECTED IN DOES YOUR UNDERGROUND AQUIFERS ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART THAT THIS BILL HELPS LARGER NOVEL. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON- MYSELF THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I APPRECIATE- THE GOOD SENATOR GIVE US GIVING US INTO OUR HISTORY WATER PRECIADO VERY MUCH BUT I WANT TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO SP FIVE FIVE NINE.

STRONGEST AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY AND SO WE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO IS PARK WE NEED TO FINALLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND WITH ALL THE INVESTMENTS WE'VE MADE ON ON PREVENTING SUBSIDENCE THESE INVESTMENTS I GUESS WE'LL GO- WILL BE BUILT ON A MUCH STRONGER- OF A FOUNDATION AND THEY WERE IN THE PAST SO- SENATORS VOTE FOR SP FIVE FIVE NINE THIS IS A GREAT BILL AND IT'S TIME TO MOVE FORWARD.

WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP STRATEGIC PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS TO BUILD ON THE GREAT WORK THAT THE STATE IS ALREADY PUT INTO OUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE PROGRAMS. IN BOTH ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS AND OTHER RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE. WE CAN SEE MORE PETROLEUM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAN ANY OTHER NATION ON THE PLANET SO FOR THE U. S. AND CHINA. CALIFORNIA WE'RE A NATION WE BE NUMBER THREE. SIX MIDDLE CLASS BUDGET. WE'RE HAVING A SUPER COMMUTE ALL OVER THE PLACE TO MAKE THEIR LIVES WORK THE AVERAGE FAMILY IN CALIFORNIA MAKING EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS. IS SPENDING MORE ON THEIR TRANSPORTATION. AND FOOD AND HEALTH CARE COMBINES. THIS IS NOT JUST AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE OR CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUE THIS IS ABOUT THE ECONOMICS OF MAKING IT IN CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED LEADERSHIP AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS TO BRING THE BEST BUSINESSES INTO CALIFORNIA. TO INCREASE MANUFACTURING TO BUILD OUT THE LITHIUM VALLEY THAT WE WANT TO NOT OUTSOURCE OUR BATTERY PRODUCTION BUT IN SOURCE IT. WENT WORKING CALIFORNIANS DO THAT WORK.

THE INDIVIDUAL CAR USERS TO ME THAT ONE OF THE CRITICAL THINGS THAT WE'VE MISSED IN THE STATE. AND MY HOPE WITH RESPECT TO THIS MEASURE IS TO DEAL WITH COMMERCIAL USE. IF WE CAN COORDINATE OUR ACTIVITIES WE CAN AVOID SPENDING TAXPAYER DOLLARS. WORKING WITH THE VARIOUS LOGISTICS PEOPLE OF THE MAJOR TRANSPORT COMPANIES TO HELP US SITE AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE ENERGY STATIONS FUELING STATIONS THAT WORK FOR THEM. IN TERMS OF THE DISTANCES THAT THEY DRIVE AND THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY WHAT IS THE RESULT OF A COORDINATED EFFORT BY THE STATE IN ADDITION TO. INDIVIDUAL CAR USE. BUT TO BE ABLE TO DRAMATICALLY EXPAND THE USE OF ELECTRIC TRUCKS IN DELIVERY AND I THINK THIS IS A BIG STEP TOWARD THAT. AN ASTEROID. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON.
