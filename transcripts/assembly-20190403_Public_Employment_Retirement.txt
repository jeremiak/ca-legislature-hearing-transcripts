PREFERRED ON YEAH I JUST I I DO I DO. JUST RECEIVED THESE RULES DO THEY HAVE A VERSION IN THERE WHERE AND WHEN MEMBERS BRING FOR DIVESTMENT BILLS. THAT WOULD IDENTIFY.

SPEAKS TO THE THE HOUSE WAS. DID NOT HEAR THOSE BILLS A DESIRE SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE NOT BUT BUT I I WOULD HOPE GOING FORWARD THAT WE WOULD CONTEMPLATE SUCH A RULE. OF RULE THAT WOULD CREATE A PROCESS WHERE WE COULD TAKE A LOOK. AT THE DIVESTMENT BILLS IN A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE FASHION BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP COMING AND I'LL JUST THIS JUST MY OPINION MISTER CHAIR I'M NOT GONNA NOW WHEN I DO NOW. YEAH I GET THAT -- BUT I I REALLY THINK WE OUGHT TO HAVE A PROCESS. AND I KNOW THE GUYS I THINK IT'S HEALTH COMMITTEE HAS A PROCESS FOR SOME BILLS THAT COME FORWARD. AND MAYBE WE SHOULD CONTEMPLATE SUCH A PROCESS INSIDE THIS COMMITTEE WHERE IN THOSE BILLS WOULD BE GIVEN A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE LOOK BEFORE THEY EVEN GET TO THE COMMITTEE OR ON THEIR WAY OUT OF THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE THESE DIVESTMENT BILLS CAN BE VERY. IMPACTFUL SOCIALLY FOR SURE BUT ALSO FISCALLY TO THE HEALTH OF OUR OF OUR OUR OUR STATE RETIREMENT FUND STIRS IN PERSON WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO RETIREES AN OBLIGATION. TWO OTHER PARTICIPANTS -- TO TO TO GET A DECENT RATE OF RETURN CERTAINLY WE SHOULD BE SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS BUT WE SHOULD ALSO BE FISCALLY CONSCIOUS THAT I TURN IT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND CONCERNS THAT ON THAT AS WELL THAT IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN TALKING STAFF JUST RECENTLY ON THAT. FOR FUTURE ADOPTION -- BUT IN THIS CURRENT SET THE REGARD OPTION THOSE ARE NOT IN THERE BUT THAT IS SOMETHING I'M LOOKING AT DOING FOR THE FEEDBACK. THAT IS WELL POINT WELL TAKEN THANK YOU. A SUMMER COOLEY QUESTION. WELL MORE JUST AN OBSERVATION BY WAY OF FOLLOW UP ON THAT. I'M ACTUALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROVISION IN QUESTION. YOUR IN BOTH THE INSURANCE CODE AND FOR THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. IF THERE'S A BILL THAT AFFECTS THE COST OF HEALTHCARE. THERE IS PROVISION THOSE CABLES -- THERE IS PROVISION THOSE COMMITTEE RULES FOR STUDIES BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY FOUNDED UPON A STATUTORY ACT BUT TROUBLES THE GOVERNMENT CODE PROVISION THAT SETS UP THE PROCESS DESIGNATE AN ENTITY THAT DOES THAT EXAMINATION. SO AT THAT POINT WE'VE ALREADY PASSED A LAW. THAT SETS UP SAY STRUCTURE. I I WILL SAY RATHER ON LIKE THE HEALTH FIELD WHICH IS SO GENERALIZED. WE DO GET. UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION I DO THINK ARE PENSION SYSTEMS ACTUALLY ALEXANDER TELLS WITH THE MONEY WOULD COME FROM BUT THEY CAN. OPINE AS THEY ALWAYS DO ON THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THESE DIVESTMENT THINGS. BUT IF WE ADOPTED THAT SORT OF THING I THINK WE NEED TO SET UP A STATUTORY STRUCTURE. AND HAS BEEN HELD BEGAN AND THEN THERE WOULD JUST BE CONFORMING A ROLE THAT STATUTE WHICH IS HOW THE INSURANCE ON HEALTH STUFF WORKS. THANK YOU POINT ORTEGA'S OUGHT TO HAVE THE BY CHERYL FOOTAGE OF QUESTIONABLE [inaudible] THE SENATE HEARING ON WILL GO AHEAD AND START. WHERE MOTION A SECOND ON THE ON THE RULES I THINK WE GOT THE MOTION? SECOND. MOTION BY THE O'DONNELL SECOND CHECK WE GOT A MESS WITH THAT. RULES ARE ADOPTED. INSPECTOR CALDERON THAT AS WELL. RODRIGUEZ I RODRIGUEZ I WILL TELL I WILL TELL AYE CERVANTES COOLEY HI COOLEY AYE COOPER. FONG. FONG AYE O'DONNELL [inaudible] O'DONNELL I RUSSERT OPTED OF FIVE EYES AND NO NOS WITH THAT WE HAVE OUR FIRST -- AUTHOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALMOST AB FIVE TWENTY NINE THE YOU KNOW YOU CAN. ALWAYS FIND THEM. WHAT WOULD FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER NEAR READY BUT I CAN'T THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AB FIVE TWO NINE GIVE US A PRACTICE OF IMPOSING ON THE SPOT MANDATORY OVERTIME OF ANY PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN OR PSYCHIATRIC. TECHNICIAN ASSISTANT WORKING AT THE STATE HOSPITAL. CHRONIC STAFFING ISSUES AT OUR STATE HOSPITALS HAVE SUBJECT IS TO HAVE TO WORK MANDATORY OVERTIME. RESULTING IN BACK TO BACK EIGHT OUR SHIPS. IN IN THE END CREATING HEALTH HAZARDS FOR PATIENTS AND STAFF. WHEN I WAS AT SAN MARINO COUNTY SUPERVISOR ACTOR PATTON STATE HOSPITAL IN OUR AREA AND IN THE SIMPLY FORTY OF DISTRICT? I WALKED INTO AN AREA WHERE ALL THE PATIENTS WERE AND STAFF WERE. AND WHAT I SAW WAS A SINGLE LINE OF PAIN AT LINE ON THE CEMENT AND THAT WAS AGREED TO THE PATIENTS WAS STATE ON ONE SIDE AND STAFF ON THE OTHER. THE SAFETY CONDITIONS THERE IS SOMETHING THAT. IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THE AREA. THERE WAS NO WALL NO BARRIER AND I MAKE REFERENCE TO MY VISIT TO PENN STATE HOSPITAL TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO PROVIDE. EMPLOYEE SAFETY AT ALL OUR STATE HOSPITALS. PUTTING A STOP TO FORCED OVERTIME ON THE PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS. NOT ONLY STRENGTHENS EMPLOYEE SAFETY BUT ALSO ENSURES PATIENTS RECEIVE PROPER CARE AND ATTENTION. I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE ONE WEEK AFTER I TORE PATTON STATE HOSPITAL A PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN WAS ATTACKED AND SHE WAS ATTACKING SHE WAS CUT. THEIR SAFETY INVOLVED IN THESE THINGS AS FAR AS MANDATORY OVERTIME BECAUSE PEOPLE AND STAFF HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BE AWARE OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS AT ALL TIMES. IT'S NOT SAYING TO PUT AN END TO OVERTIME MAKE IT MORE OF A VOLUNTARY SO THAT PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY ADJUSTER LIFE SCHEDULES. TO COMPLETE THAT OVER TIME. WITH ME TODAY IS KOBE -- REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS AND SPONSOR OF AB FIVE TWO NINE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURZUM KOBE PRESIDED WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC% TECHNICIANS FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THINK COMMITTEE STAFF FURTHER THOROUGH AND ACCURATE ANALYSIS OF AB -- FIVE TWENTY NINE OUR MEMBERS ARE THE LARGEST DIRECT LEVEL MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN STATE HOSPITALS PRISONS AND DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. AB FIVE TWENTY NINE WOULD PROHIBIT. THE STATE FROM USING MANDATORY OVERTIME ON ALL CLASSIFICATIONS OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS AS A STAFFING TOOL [inaudible] OF AS MANY OF YOU KNOW ABOUT 92% OF THE PATIENTS THAT ARE IN STATE HOSPITALS ARE THERE UNDER FRIENDS A COMMITMENT THAT MEANS. THEY'RE EITHER NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL WHETHER A SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR -- THEY'VE BEEN THERE -- OR BEEN ASSIGNED TO THOSE HOSPITALS BECAUSE THEY HAVE COMMITTED A SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OFFENSE. LAST YEAR AS MR ALMOST SPOKE. ABOUT A MINUTE AGO. OF OUR MEMBERS WAS BRUTALLY ATTACKED WITH THE SHANK NOW. PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS ARE THE FIRST RESPONDERS WHEN AN INCIDENT HAPPENS. BUT IT ACTUALLY TOOK A PATIENT. TO TACKLE THE ASSAILANT. AND SAVED OUR MEMBERS LIVES THAT'S HOW DANGEROUS THESE FACILITIES ARE. THAT REALLY UNDERLINES THE NEED TO BE ALERT AND AWARE WHEN YOU'RE ON THE JOB. AND WORKING AT THE BACK TO BACK SIXTEEN HOUR SHIFTS WHEN YOU HAVE NOT. HAD ENOUGH SLEEP HAD NOT PREPARED ENOUGH FOOD HAD NOT. HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ENOUGH BREAKS TO BE RESTED. LAST YEAR THERE WAS TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED ASSAULTS ON STAFF. WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS IN STATE HOSPITALS. IT'S SO IT'S REALLY NOT A MATTER OF IF YOU GET THE SALTED IT'S A MATTER OF WHEN YOU GET ASSAULTED IN [inaudible] ADDITIONAL [inaudible] ADDITIONALLY. NURSING THE PROFESSION OF NURSING IS A FEMALE DOMINATED INDUSTRY. AND ABOUT 6265% OF OUR MEMBERSHIP. ARE WOMEN. AND ABOUT 15% OF THAT 60%. ARE SINGLE MOMS SO. WHEN YOU HAVE? A PRIMARY CARE GIVER LIKE A SINGLE MOM TO A CHILD. YOU'VE NOW IMPACTED THEM. MORE SO THAN ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE TRYING TO GET. TRYING TO GET CHILD CARE ARRANGE TRYING TO FIND SOMEBODY -- TO PICK UP THAT CHILD AFTER SCHOOL. WHEN YOU'VE BEEN TAPPED ON THE SHOULDER TO WORK A SIXTEEN HOUR DAY? JUST MINUTES BEFORE. HIM YOU'RE GETTING READY TO WALK OUT THE GATE. THAT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. AND IF YOU ARE. GETTING READY TO WALK OUT AND YOU SAY NO I HAVE TO GO PICK UP MY CHILD. THEN YOU FACE AN ADVERSE ACTION SO. THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN DID A REPORT. THAT RECOMMENDED TO THE LEGISLATURE [inaudible] TO DECREASE. THE AMOUNT OF MAN ERIC TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF OVERTIME BY 50% -- OF THE TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN NUMBERS. BY THE YEAR. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TO ELIMINATE THE USE OF MANDATORY OVERTIME. IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEPT OF EMERGENCIES. THANKFULLY THISYEAR IN THE JANUARY BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS ISSUED. IT PROPOSES. THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE NEW PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN POSITIONS TO BE TRANSITIONED OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. WITH AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR PERMANENT INTERMITTENT POSITIONS TO HELP PRODUCE OVER TIME. THIS INVESTMENT INTO OUR STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM WILL VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE ALL MANDATORY OVERTIME. IN STATE HOSPITALS AND IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION SUGGESTED -- WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBERS COOPER. COOLEY O'DONNELL. FOR SUPPORTING THIS BILL LAST TIME -- WHEN IT CAME BEFORE YOU IN? TWENTY SIXTEEN IS SB SEVEN EIGHTY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES FOR BEING A JOINT AUTHOR. AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE -- TAPPED STATE PRESIDENT ERIC SOTO. WHEN OTHER PERSONAL COMMENTS? GOOD MORNING -- WITHIN PLEASURE AND HONOR TO ADDRESS YOU GUYS HERE TODAY -- AS KOBE STATED MY NAME IS ERIC SOTO. I AM THE STATE PRESIDENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS. I AM A LICENSE LIKE TECH AND I HAVE DEDICATED OVER TWENTY YEARS -- TUESDAY TO CALIFORNIA'S DEPARTMENTS THE HOSPITAL'S. SPECIFICALLY THE METROPOLITAN STATE HOSPITAL IN NORWALK. I'M HERE TO SPEAK TO THE NECESSITY OF ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE TWENTY NINE AND THE NEED TO END THE PRACTICE OF FORCED MANDATORY OVERTIME FOR THOSE OF MY PROFESSION. AS KOBE STATED WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY SIX THOUSAND PSYCH TEXAN RELATED CLASSIFICATIONS WORKING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE PROVIDE CARE TREATMENT. MEDICATION AND THERAPEUTIC SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND THOSE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. WE WORK IN DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS STATE HOSPITALS. AND IN OUR STATE'S PRISONS. I CAN CERTAINLY ASSURE YOU THAT SITE TAX. DO NOT GET IN THIS PROFESSION WITH THE HOPE OF EXTRAVAGANT PAY AND RICHES. AND THOSE ENTERING A PROFESSION ALL UNDERSTAND THAT OUR JOB AS INHERENT RISKS. AND DANGERS ASSOCIATED ASSOCIATED WITH IT. HOWEVER WE ARE PROUD. OF THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. IN WE HOPE THAT OUR EMPLOYER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES EVERYTHING THEY CAN. TO MINIMIZE THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH CARRYING OUT OUR DUTIES. AND ONE OF THE MOST PREVALENT AND WIDESPREAD DANGERS IS MANDATORY OVERTIME. I WOULD. LIKE TO ASK YOU GUYS TO PLEASE TRY TO IMAGINE GOING TO WORK. IN A SETTING WITH A HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU COULD BE HIT. SPENT ON PUNCHED KICKED BEATEN. OR EVEN KILLED. WHEN YOU WORK IN THESE CONDITIONS YOU HAVE TO BE AWAKE AND ALERT FOR YOUR ENTIRE SHIFT? READY TO RESPOND IN A CRISIS. IN ALL THE WHILE PROVIDING QUALITY CARE TO THOSE PATIENTS THAT ARE IN YOUR CHARGE. MANY TIMES AT THE END OF YOUR SHIFT. YOUR BACK IS ACHING YOUR SHOULDERS ARE TENSE. FROM THE CONSTANT AND NEVER ENDING NEED. TO CONSTANTLY LOOK BEHIND YOU. FIVE MINUTES BEFORE YOUR SHIP DANS. YOU CAN GET A PHONE CALL TELLING YOU YOU CAN'T GO HOME. YOUR MANDATE IT TO WORK. YOU'RE STUCK FOR ANOTHER EIGHT HOURS. WHEN SPIKE TECHS GET THIS CALL BECAUSE OFTEN THROW OUR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF OUR LOVED ONES INTO DISARRAY? PARENTS HAVE TO SCRAMBLE TO TRYING TO ARRANGE FOR THE CHILDREN TO GET PICKED UP FROM SCHOOL. OR TO FIND CHILDCARE OFTEN AT THE LAST MINUTE. I HAVE PERSONALLY WITNESSED. FELLOWS LIKE TEXAN TEARS. BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T ARRANGE OR FIND SOMEONE TO PICK UP HER CHILD. OUR MEMBERS ARE SOMETIMES FACED WITH THE AWFUL CHOICE. DO I STAY AT WORK ASK ORDERED AND LEAVE MY CHILD UNATTENDED. WHERE DO I GO AND ATTEND TO MY CHILD? AND THEREBY RISKING POSSIBLE DISCIPLINE. I CAN SPEAK FROM FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE. MY BROTHERS AND DIRE SECOND GENERATION PSYCHICS. OUR MOTHER WAS A SENIOR PSYCH TECH WHO WORKED AN OPTION WHICH IS ELEVEN PM AT NIGHT TO SEVEN IN THE MORNING. TOO MANY TIMES SHE WOULD CALL US UP IN THE MORNING TO TELL US THAT SHE WAS MANDATE IT. AND THAT WE ALL HAVE TO FIND A WAY AND WALK TO SCHOOL. I COULD TELL YOU HOW MANY BIRTHDAYS AND HOLIDAYS WERE SPENT WITHOUT HER BECAUSE OF THE PRACTICE OF MANDATORY OVERTIME. TO THIS DAY THIS PRACTICE CONTINUES. AND THE CHILDREN OF SOME OF THE MOST DEDICATED PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. ARE MISSING OUT IN GROWING UP WITH THEIR FAMILIES PRESENT FOR SOME MAJOR EVENTS OF THEIR LIVES. IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH. THE STATE IN SIMPLE TERMS. FORCED MANDATORY OVERTIME IS NOT SAFE. STAFF ARE EXPECTED TO BE ALERT AT ALL TIMES. WHEN THE SLIGHTEST LAPS AND OBSERVATION COULD LEAD TO TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES? MANDATORY OVERTIME FLATLY MEANS UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS. WE ARE MANDATED TO COVER STAFF SHORTAGES. STAFF GET EXHAUSTED AND GET BURNED OUT. THIS LEAVES THE STAFF BEING LESS ALERT. THIS ALSO MEANS A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF STAFF INJURIES. WHICH CAN ALSO AGAIN LEAD TO STAFF BECOMING SO EXHAUSTED. THAT MANY OF THEM CALL IN JUST TO AVOID BEING MANDATED. WHICH OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN SEE IS GONNA SELL PERPETUATE THAT CYCLE. MY FELLOW PSYCH TECHS ENTERED INTO STATE SERVICE BECAUSE WE WANTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE WANTED TO PROVIDE A VITAL SERVICE TO A POPULATION. THAT IS OFTEN MARGINALIZED AND STIGMATIZED. HELP CALIFORNIA'S LIKE TAX PROVIDE QUALITY CARE. HELPS CALIFORNIA'S PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS ENJOY A SAFER WORKPLACE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. WITH THE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BRIAN NELSON -- REPRESENT THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES SIDE PLEASED TO BE HERE STRONG SUPPORTER THIS VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION -- PROTECT BUT THE SISSON STATE HOSPITALS AND A STATE FACILITY. GOOD MORNING MR MEMBERS RANCHO THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION FORCED OVERTIME THREATENS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL THOSE ASSIGNED TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF THESE FACILITIES. MEMBERS OF THE ARE SAY ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO WORK OUR STATE HOSPITALS AND WE SUPPORT AB FIVE TWO NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ADRIN MOHAMMED WITH THE UNION OF AMERICAN PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. SEEN IN HEARING ON ANY QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SOME REMOTE ONE ON ONE THANK YOU MISTER SOTO -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION VERY THOROUGH NEARLY TOLD THE HUMAN SIDE. OF THE IMPACT OF THIS THIS THIS -- CHALLENGE SO THE ANSWER SO THE ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM IS REALLY TO HIRE MORE PSYCH TAX CORRECT AND YOU SAID OR ARE THEY IN THIS ARE THEY IN. TALKING ABOUT THIS YEAR'S PROPOSED BUDGET YOU KNOW BETTER THAN I DO AT THIS POINT YEAH SO. IT IN GOVERNOR SOME FOR PROPOSED BUDGET OUT OF JANUARY. THE BUDGET INCLUDED OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE NEWS PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN POSITIONS. THEN THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL IMMEDIATE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR PERMANENT INTERMITTENT POSITIONS USED TO BE -- USED FOR JUST PURELY OVERTIME PURPOSES SO YOU HAVE A TOTAL OF ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY OVER THE COURSE OF THREE YEARS NEW PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN POSITIONS. THAT WILL VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE ALL OF THE MANDATORY OVERTIME. ONE THING I DIDN'T POINT OUT WAS THIS PRACTICE OF MANDATORY OVERTIME IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS BEEN BANNED SINCE. TWO THOUSAND ONE AND SO I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT -- WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF EQUITY -- IN THE STATE PRACTICES AS WELL THANK YOU. BY SURE GOING [inaudible] QUESTION. HOW COME YOU HAVEN'T? ACHIEVE THIS AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I'M TIRED. SO THIS BILL AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT -- WE HAVE PROVISIONS IN OUR CONTRACT THAT STATES HOW MANY TIMES WE CAN BE MANDATED A MONTH. SO THE LAST TIME WE RAN THIS BILL -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHAT'S HAPPENED TO BE A CONTRACT YEAR -- WE WERE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE DOWN FROM SIX TIMES A MONTH. DOWN TO FIVE TIMES A MONTH. AGAIN FIVE TIMES A MONTH IS A BIT TOO MUCH I THINK WHEN THE PRACTICE IN. AN OF ITSELF IS. JUST A POOR PRACTICE IT I WE'VE TRIED TO GET MORE LEVERAGE IN MORE TRACTION IN NEGOTIATING IT IN OUR CONTRACT BUT EACH TIME WE'VE TRIED. WE'VE. MOVEMENT VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT AND COMPLETE RESISTANCE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THEN WHEN WE TRIED TO RUN A BILL THE BILL GOT VETO. SO WE'RE UP AGAINST THE WALL NOW WE HAVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION WE HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT'S WILLING TO INVEST INTO OUR STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. TO TRYING TO REMOVE -- THE AMOUNTS OF MANDATORY OVERTIME AND OVER TIME IN GENERAL. WE REALLY THINK THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT PATH BECAUSE IN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY MOVEMENT AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES. OKAY I'M. I CERTAINLY SEE THE NEED FOR THIS. BUT I HAVE TROUBLE CIRCUMVENT IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS SO. JUST LOOKING AT IT FROM A MANAGEMENT VIEWPOINT WHICH IS. MY WHOLE WORLD. I WOULD HAVE TROUBLE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. BUT I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY. THE NEED [inaudible] FOR THANK YOU. THANK IN IN IN APPRECIATE THOSE THOSE COMMENTS ARE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT IN THE MEANTIME GOING FROM. THE SIX MANDATORY OVERTIME IS TWO TWO FIVE THEY'RE STILL LIVES ARE BEING JEOPARDIZED -- BEING TO SEE THE THE FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE OF VISIT IN THAT AREA AND SEEN A PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN A WEEK LATER BE ATTACKED SO SEVERELY -- BRINGS UP QUESTION INTO THE SAFETY OF THOSE EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS THE STAFF THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. OKAY SO WITH THAT SAID. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. SECOND MOTION SECOND WAS COULD I THINK SOMEONE WANTED TO ADD SOMETHING ON HIM TO A GOING AT ONE QUICK ONE COMMENT. YES RECORD I MEAN I JUST ALSO WANT TO SEE THE NEED FOR ELIMINATING MANDATORY OVERTIME IN GENERAL EVEN. IN THE WORLD WE LIVE IN WITH HOUSING BECAUSE WHAT THEY ARE WE FIND THAT WE HAVE MANY MEMBERS ALL OVER THE STATE. HAVING TO DRIVE HOURS JUST TO THEIR PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT. SO WHEN YOU MANDATE SOMEBODY TO WORK THEY WORK SIXTEEN HOURS. THE UP THE DRIVE TWO HOURS HOME. TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP MAKE THAT TWO HOUR DRIVE BACK TO WORK. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY AND I CAN CERTAINLY TELL YOU I'VE HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. OF FALLING ASLEEP AT AT THE WHEEL DRIVING HOME AFTER OVERTIME SHIFTS SO. AGAIN I I'D DIE UP IS STRONG SAY THAT I'VE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE ANY MANDATORY OVERTIME. THANK YOU WITH THAT SAID -- SOMEONE LIKE GO IN CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND WITH THAT SAID YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATION HAVE REGARDING MANDATORY FORCED OVERTIME. A KIND OF A PERSONAL REFLECTION BACK TO ME WORKING I'M WAS ENTRY FOR ALL THESE YEARS WE TALK ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT HOUR SHIFT. WE'RE JUST THINK ABOUT IT THERE'S MANY TIMES BACK WHEN I WORKED MANY YEARS IN THE INDUSTRY. THAT I WAS FORCED TO WORK TWENTY FOUR HOURS IMAGINE WORKING SEVENTY TWO HOURS STRAIGHT BECAUSE ONE SHIFT I WOULD WORK MY RIVER TWENTY FOUR HOUR SHIFT. THE SECOND DAY WOULD BE MY DAY OFF BECAUSE THE THIRD IT WOULD WORK. BUT THERE MANY TIMES THAT I WAS FORCED TO WORK THAT SECOND DAY SO SEVENTY TWO HOURS STRAIGHT WITHOUT NO REST. NO BREAK SO TO SPEAK AND COSTLY WORKING TIME AND TIME AGAIN SO I SEE THE NEED FOR THIS TYPE OF BILL. AND WHAT IT DOES TO THIS EMPLOYEES DOING THEIR JOB PROTECTING THEMSELVES AND PROVIDING CARE FOR THOSE OF THE PATIENTS SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. I FULLY SUPPORT AND I COULD HAVE A PERSONAL REFERENCE ON HOW IT AFFECTED MY LIFE IN. IN EVERYTHING I'VE DONE YOU KNOW WITH OUR FAMILY LIKE YOU TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO GET FAMILY CARE FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE FORCED TO WORK WHETHER IT'S THE EIGHT HOURS IN MY CASE TWENTY FOUR HOURS SO I DO HAVE AN IRAQ ON THIS.

SO WHAT THAT WILL GO HEAD TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA ITEM NUMBER FOUR A. B.. THREE FOURTEEN MORNING MR CHAIR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS ANKH MORNING STAFF. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB THREE ONE FOUR AND FOR THE WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR STAFF HAVE PUT INTO THE MEASURE MISTER CHAIR. AB THREE ONE FOUR WITH EXPANDED UNIFORMLY APPLY REASONABLE TIME OFF WITHOUT LOSS OF COMPENSATION TO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN SHORT PROVIDES. UNIFORMITY AND SPECIFICITY THAT'S NEEDED IN RELEASE TIME FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNDER EXISTING LAW PUBLIC EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO ALLOW EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES REASONABLE TIME OFF WITHOUT LOSS OF COMPENSATION IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN ACTIVITIES. RELATED TO EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS SUCH AS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN MATTERS BEFORE. PERSONAL COMMISSIONS THIS IS REFERRED TO AS RELEASE TIME. IN PREVIOUS YEARS THERE'VE BEEN A GROWING NUMBER OF ATTACKS ON WORKERS RIGHTS IN ORDER TO THWART. THEIR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN COLLECTIVE POWER ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA HAS A POLICY OF PROVIDING REASONABLE TIME OFF WITHOUT LOSS OF PAY TO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THE LOCK. IS AND HAS BEEN INEFFECTIVE IN ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO MEANINGFULLY PARTICIPATE IN EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS BECAUSE CURRENT LAW. IS INCONSISTENT ACROSS DIFFERENT SECTORS OF EMPLOYMENT. IN ORDER FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES TO BENEFIT FROM THEIR RIGHTS TO REPRESENTATION THEY NEED TO BE CERTAIN OF THEIR PAID TIME OFF ALLOWANCES. AND BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES BENEFIT. WHEN WORKERS PARTICIPATE IN EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE DISPUTES AND FACILITATE HARMONIOUS LABOR MANAGEMENT RELATIONS AB THREE ONE FOUR WOULD LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD? BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES IT WOULD CREATE UNIFORMITY ACROSS ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SECTOR LABOR RELATIONS LAWS BY GRANTING ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES EQUAL RIGHTS TO REASONABLE PAID TIME OFF. TO ENGAGE AND SPECIFIED ACTIVITIES. NOW MORE THAN EVER CALIFORNIA SHOULD TAKE THE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT OUR WORKERS ARE EMPOWERED AND HAVE VOICES IN THEIR EMPLOYMENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. I WITH ME MITCHELL CASTRO REPRESENTING S. YEAH YOU THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL START. GOOD MORNING SHALL CAST OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION -- AS MR BONTA SAID THIS IS A SIMPLE MEASURE BUILDING OFF OF EXISTING LAW -- WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS IT EXISTING LAW FORTY EMPLOYER. TO USE AS MUCH TIME AND RESOURCES FOR THEIR EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER RELATIONS THEY CAN ASSIGN AS MANY STAFF FOR UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OF TIME TO MAKE SURE THE POSITION IS REPRESENTED. THEY CAN HIRE AS MANY OUTSIDE LAW FIRMS AND CONSULTANTS AS THEY WANT BUT CONVERSELY THE TIME FOR EMPLOYEES TO PARTICIPATE. WITH PAY IS VERY VERY LIMITED -- CALIFORNIA HAS A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING STATUTES AND EACH OF THOSE PROVIDE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RELEASE TIME SOME SAY COULD PARTICIPATE IN THE FORMAL BARGAINING PROCESS. ONCE SAID YOU CAN GO BEFORE PER IN A CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION ANOTHER SAYS YOU CAN PARTICIPATE THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS BUT IT'S NOT EQUAL AND IT'S VERY LIMITED -- SO FOR EMPLOYEES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BARGAINING PROCESS THEY NEED TO HAVE TIME OFF WITH PAY SO THAT THEY CAN. HAVE THEIR POSITION REPRESENTED -- THE EMPLOYER'S GONNA THE IMPORT OPPOSITION IS GOING TO COME UP AND SAY THAT THIS BILL A RHODES COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IS THAT RELEASE TIME IS A PRODUCT OF THE STATUTE IT IS NOT A PRODUCT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WHAT IS COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED. IS WHAT DOES A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME OFF IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME AND REASONABLE AMOUNT OF EMPLOYEES ME. SO THE STATUTE HAS ALWAYS DICTATED WHAT TYPES OF ACTIVITY CAN BE GIVEN FOR RELEASE TIME. AND THAT IT'S FOR REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME SO THIS BILL IN NO WAY UNDERMINES THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. PROCESS AT ALL. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT SOME EMPLOYERS HAVE. GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND THE STATUTE WHICH WE APPRECIATE AND HOW IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS -- AGREE TO ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS TO RELEASE TIME BUT FOR THE EMPLOYEES TO GET THAT THEY HAVE TO GIVE SOMETHING ELSE UP OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TABLE. AND WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY FAIR AGAIN THIS BILL DOES NOT NECESSARILY PUT THE EMPLOYEES ON PAR WITH THE EMPLOYER IT JUST SAYS. THE EMPLOYER MUST GIVE THEM A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME OFF TO A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF EMPLOYEE FOR ONLY SPECIFIED PURPOSES WE HAVE THREE EITHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHAI SURPRISES BUT THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION I WOULD ONLY EMPHASIZED ON THE FACT THAT THIS IS UNIFORMITY IF YOU LOOK AT THE BILL ITSELF YOU'LL SEE THAT. ALL THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS THAT ALREADY ESTABLISHED RELEASED I'M RIGHT. PROVIDING REASONABLE TIME TO DEPLOY IS THERE IN EXISTING LAW IS BEING RE CASTED AND WILK CAPTURING ALL THE CLARITY THAT'S NECESSARY SO THE EMPLOYEES CAN REPRESENT HIMSELF. FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE CHOI AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE SUPPORT. WITH THE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BY NELSON ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES ARE I WON'T -- REHASH APPOINT EVER MADE I THINK THEY WERE INCREDIBLY -- SALIENT POINTS I'D JUST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR THE VERY COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS AND SHE COMMITTEE -- TO PLEASE SUPPORT THIS PURPORTED PIECE OF LEGISLATION. WHAT MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS? GIVE ME SAID BRAMBLE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION -- I THINK AS WITH STATED YOU KNOW THIS IS A A SIMPLE BILL ABOUT UNIFORMITY ABOUT CLARITY ABOUT PARITY -- CERTAINLY REPRESENTS CALIFORNIA VALUES WE WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. MR MEMBERS MIKE WE'LL WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION STRONG SUPPORT. MATT CRIMMINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA THAT A CONFERENCE OF OPERATING ENGINEERS IN STRONG SUPPORT. RESIDENTS ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN STRONG SUPPORT. SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS THE AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION MACHINISTS AND I. F. E. LOCAL TWENTY ONE SPORT. RAIN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. ON YOUR CAR BEING WITH THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEN ON ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. PLEASE COME FORWARD GOING WHEN YOU'RE A CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DEALING GIVEN FOR THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WE HAVE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. ON THIS BILL. IN PARTICULAR WE ARE LOOKING TO HAVE THE ITEM RELATED TO TIME OFF FOR EMPLOYEE ORIENTATIONS -- REMOVED FROM THE BILL THIS WAS A TOPIC THAT WAS. DEBATED GREATLY AND NEGOTIATED AS PART OF THE EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION. LANGUAGE THAT WAS PART OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET. FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS -- PUBLICATIONS HE SAT DOWN WITH THE UNIONS TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH -- WHAT THE EMPLOYEE ORIENTATIONS WOULD LOOK LIKE AN ULTIMATELY WE WERE ABLE TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION BECAUSE OF AN AGREEMENT WE CAME? TO ON ON THAT LANGUAGE ONE OF THE VERY SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF THAT LANGUAGE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WAS THE EMPLOYEE ORIENTATIONS -- THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE PAID LEAVE TIME -- FOR UNION EMPLOYEES TO DO THIS WORK AND THAT IT COULD BE LEFT TO NEGOTIATION AND PART OF THE M. O. U. PROCESS AND THE REASON. WAS BECAUSE ORIENTATIONS VERY SO GREATLY AT DIFFERENT PUBLIC AGENCIES WITH THE WITH OVER TWO THOUSAND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. RANGING SIGNIFICANTLY IN SIZE -- SOME AGENCIES HAVE ORIENTATIONS ONCE A YEAR FOR NEW EMPLOYEES WHICH CASE IT'S NOT A PROBLEM TO TO ALLOW FOR FOR PAID LEAVE FOR THAT EMPLOYEE. HOWEVER OF SOME OF OUR OTHER -- DISTRICTS HAVE -- ORIENTATIONS EVERY WEEK A HALF AN HOUR OR THEY HAVE MULTIPLE ORIENTATIONS A WEEK. AS WE WOULD END UP WITH HIM WHO HE IS THERE A BETTER TAKING HOURS OFF EVERY WEEK -- TO BE -- TO PARTICIPATE NEEDS ORIENTATIONS THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY WHY IT WAS LEFT OUT OF THE ORIENTATION LANGUAGE THE THERE WAS A ADOPTED IN THE BUDGET. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS LANGUAGE GOES BACK ON WHAT WAS AGREED TO AND WHAT WAS PUT IN THE THE BUDGET FOR THOSE REASONS -- WE'RE SEEKING FOR THAT PROVISION TO BE REMOVED FROM THE BILL. GOOD MORNING YOUR MEMBERS TING HUTCHINGS ITALY CALIFORNIA CITIES -- MY LINE MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION -- WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT DOESN'T AND IMPACTED THE BARGAINING PROCESS AS YOU SURF THE BARGAINING PROCESS I'M YOU KNOW WHAT YOU TO WEEK WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT -- YOU KNOW ONE SIZE FITS ALL PURCHASE DON'T REALLY APPLY -- AT LEAST FROM A CITY PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY COMPLAINTS -- BUT NOT HEARD ANY COMPLAINTS -- Và -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHEN THIS LAW WAS ENACTED SPECIFIC TO THE ORIENTATION PIECE. OF FOLKS ARE ABLE TO SIT DOWN CARE **** -- LOCALLY -- AS FAR AS TIME PLACE MANNER -- AND RELEASE TIME -- WITH YOU TO WHAT WE SEE TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHEN WE HAVE THESE ISSUES WITH REGARDS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING -- THAT IF WE CAN IF IF THE LOCAL UNION IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING WHAT THEY WHAT THEY NEED THEY THEY TALK TO THEIR FOLKS THE STATE UNION CENTER SABELLA TAKES OFF THE BARGAINING TABLE IS ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT. THE LEAGUE IS VERY VERY PRO. LOCAL BARGAINING WE WANT YOU WOULD NEGOTIATE HAVE THESE DIALOGUES ARE LOCAL UNIONS -- WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS DOES -- YOU SIR THE PARKING PROCESS THANK YOU. FAIR ABOUT HIS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS REPRESENTING TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND SCHOOL BUSINESS LEADERS AND THE CATER TALL. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE WORLD OUR CONCERN IS THAT AB THREE FOURTEEN WOULD PLACE AN ATTIC CONSTRAIN ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN COUNTY OFFICES TO RE DIRECT RESOURCES. TO SECURE ADDITIONAL STAFFING SUBSTITUTES TO COVER FOR THESE ADDITIONAL RELEASED TIMES ALL THE WHILE WHILE PROVIDING FOR COMPENSATION TO EMPLOYEES TAKING THE ADDITIONAL RELEASE TIME AND THEN THAT NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THIS WORLD THAT. IN EDUCATION WE CANNOT RAISE OUR OWN REVENUES WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO CHARGE FEES FOR OUR SERVICES AND SO WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT LEVEL OF SUPPORT IN STAFFING. WHEN OUR STUDENTS ARE AVAILABLE AND AND THEY ARE TO LEARN SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AGAIN WE ARE RESPECTING THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS THAT WE'RE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS LOCALLY TO ENSURE THAT EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT COUNTY OFFICE?

TO SERVICE UNITS REPRESENTED THAT ACTUALLY WAS NOT AGREED -- TO THAT. WE CERTAINLY AS A UNITS TO NOT AGREE TO A SOMETHING THAT WE SOUGHT OUT BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT MINISTRATION AT THAT TIME -- DID NOT ONE INCLUDE IN THAT LANGUAGE SINCE THAT TIME IT IS TRUE THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY YOU IN UNIONIZED PUBLIC EMPLOYER CALIFORNIA HAS AGREED TO EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE OBJECTING. TO THAT EMPLOYEES CAN SERVE AS A UNION REPRESENTATIVE AND RECEIVE PAY DURING THAT TIME. THE DIFFERENCES IS IN THE CUT TO BARGAINING AGREEMENT THEY CAN COME BACK AND TAKE THAT AWAY. IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE LAW THAT ALL HAS ALWAYS PROVIDED WHAT CAN BE GIVEN FOR RELEASE TIME OR NOT IN THE STATUTE. SO THAT'S OUR CONTENTION IS THAT WE WE'RE NOT ABLE. TO PUT INTO THE STATUTE AT THAT TIME WHAT WE WANTED TO SO WE CAME BACK FOR IT IS NOT A MATTER OF THAT WE DIDN'T GET IT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TABLE. BECAUSE WE DID COME BACK AND GET IT. THERE ALSO A FEW ARBITRATIONS WHERE THE EMPLOYER SOUGHT NOT TO DO THAT OR THE ARBITRATOR RULED THAT THEY NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE EMPLOYEES. THAT TIME IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION MEETING. FOR WITH REGARD TO PREPARATION OF FOR BARGAINING BUT IT'S NOT ME THAT WAS A RECENT PER DECISION DEFINING WHAT THAT MEANS -- SO I THINK THAT THAT'S BEEN.

FILE ITEM NUMBER. TWO AB [inaudible] TWO FORTY NINE THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND. THE MORNING CHAIR RIGHT REGRESA AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- TODAY YEAH I AM PRESENTING AB. TWO FORTY NINE TO PROVIDE THE SAME PROTECTION FOR EMPLOYEES SO WHETHER THEY JOIN WHAT DO NOT JOIN A UNION. UNDER CURRENT COLD. SPECIFICALLY -- GOVERNMENT COAL WITH THE SECTION THREE FIVE FIVE ZERO A PUBLIC EMPLOYEE -- SHALL NOT DETER OR DISCOURAGE A PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WALK UP THE KINDS TO BE OP PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SO FROM BECOMING OR REMAINING MEMBERS SO OFTEN EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION. I AM CURRENTLY ON AWAY -- OFFER ANY PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. THAT THAT WOULD ISSUE THE EMPLOYEES OR APPLICANTS OF FROM ABUSE OF WHAT EMPLOYERS. ARE DETERRING AURA DISCOURAGING APPLICANTS SO WHAT EMPLOYEES SO FROM NOT JOINING A UNION. THERE STANDS OUT ON OPEN AREA OF COLD. THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE THE FOURTH IS A PROTECTION. WHETHER THE OPPOSITION. OUT WHILE THE OPPOSITION HAS SO INUNDATED TO MY OFFICE SO WITH THE COURTS AND THE EMAIL SAID EXPLAINING. HOW THIS IS OUR ALREADY PROTECTED UNDER COLD? NOT ONE HAS ACTUALLY SIDED THE COLD THOUGHT THAT PROTECTS EMPLOYEES IN THIS ARE IMPORTANT ISSUE. THIS BILL. TWO AB TWO FORTY NINE IS OUT NOT TO CREATE THE HARMFUL. OR OUT TO FIGHT THE UNION. BUT TO INSTEAD THAT PROVIDE THE EQUAL PROTECTION FOR INDIVIDUALS TO DECIDE. EITHER WAY FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER TO JOIN ONE NOT TO JOIN.

FOR AND WITH THAT SAID WE HAVE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE COM. FOR GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MICHELLE CAST OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION -- TO ONE IT JUST POINT OUT THAT AN EMPLOYEE'S DECISION TO JOIN OR TO NOT JOIN THE UNION. IS ALREADY PROTECTED ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE SEVERAL STATUTES THE EFFORT THAT A FROM THIS OVER AND OVER. IT SAYS THAT NEITHER A UNION NOR AN EMPLOYER CAN INTIMIDATE DISCRIMINATE. WART A PERSON'S DECISION TO JOIN OR NOT JOIN A UNION. AN EMPLOYER CANNOT ENGAGE IN ANY DISCRIMINATORY BEHAVIOR TOWARDS ANY EMPLOYEE FOR JOINING OR NOT JOINING A UNION. SOME OF THESE LAWS THAT SAY THIS GO BACK. FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS -- THESE LAWS HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES LIKE PERP THE SUPREME COURT THE WELL ESTABLISHED WHEN WE ADD -- ADDITIONAL STATUTES WITH DIFFERENT LANGUAGE IT CHANGES THE MEANING A WELL ESTABLISHED LAW AND INTERPRETATIONS BY THE SUPREME COURT. SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL REALLY PROVIDES NOTHING. BUT CONFUSION TO EXISTING LAW -- EMPLOYEES WHEN THEY GET HIRED THEY'RE NOT AUTOMATICALLY UNION MEMBERS THEY HAVE TO TAKE AN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TO BECOME A UNION MEMBER SO AN EMPLOYER -- WHEN THEY'RE HIRING PEOPLE DON'T DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF WHETHER SOME OF THE UNION MEMBER NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T BECOME A UNION MEMBER UNTIL AFTER THEY GET HIRED? UNTIL AFTER THEY ACTUALLY SIGN A CARD SAYING I WANT TO BE A UNION MEMBER SO WE REALLY THINK THIS BILL IS -- NOT ENHANCING OF EXISTING LAW BUT INSTEAD CONFUSING OF EXISTING LAW THANK YOU. IS THE CHAIR OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PRIDE ALFA BEHALF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES ALSO IN A STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. FOR MANY OF THE REASONS THAT WERE STATED BY MY COLLEAGUE ARE MISCAST FOR FROM S.

OF AND YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST CONCERNED -- AND WOULD HOPE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE AS LEGISLATIVE BODY ODD GIVES CRITICAL CONSIDERATION OUGHT TO WHY THIS BILL WILL BE BROUGHT FORWARD IN THE HOPES THAT THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO DEMONIZED PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE LABOR MOVEMENT AS A WHOLE -- YOU KNOW FOR FIGHTING TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS THAT WE'VE WORKED TO OBTAIN -- THE YOU KNOW FOR THE FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED WE CAN SEE NOR THE MOTIVATION FOR WHY THIS BILL IS BEING BROUGHT FOR WE'D ASK.

HOW GOOD MORNING -- CHAIRMAN RODRIGUEZ SEVEN MEMBERS IT COMMITTEE MY NAME'S RALPH BLACK CAM HERE REPRESENTING -- DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA STATE EMPLOYEES WITH DISABILITIES -- BOTH -- DR SEE AN ACCENT OR IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. THREE SIXTY FIVE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ONE AND THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL A. B. NINE TO FIVE WHICH ESTABLISHED THE GOAL OF HAVING CALIFORNIA BECOME A MODEL EMPLOYER PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THE STATE IS HISTORICALLY HAD A TWO PRIMARY MECHANISMS TO TRY TO PROMOTE HIRING THE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE ONE IS THE LIMITED EXAMINATION AN APPOINTMENT PROGRAM -- AND THE OTHER IS A REQUIREMENT THAT. A STATE AGENCIES SET GOALS FOR HIRING OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES BUT DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF THESE. REQUIREMENTS. INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ARE STILL SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER REPRESENTED IN STATE GOVERNMENT AND MANY AGENCIES HIRE A FEW IF ANY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. SO WHY IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- GARCIA MENTIONED -- IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN CAL H. R. DEPARTMENT OF REHAB STATE PERSONNEL BOARD CONVENED A TASK FORCE TO STUDY HOW TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN THESE ARE. PROGRAMS AND IMPROVE THE HIRING OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES -- BACK SAID TO MANY OTHER DISABILITY ORGANIZATIONS WERE -- INVOLVED IN MANY HOURS OF DISCUSSIONS IN THIS TASK FORCE. THE REPORT WAS ISSUED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE MADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE ON IMPLEMENTING THOSE REGULATIONS ARE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT MUCH MORE STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND A. B. THREE SIXTY FIVE WOULD TAKE SEVERAL IMPORTANT STEPS FORWARD IN THAT PROCESS. FIRST OF ALL IT WOULD ASK CALLIE CHAR TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE LEAP PROGRAM RIGHT NOW THERE ARE ONLY NINE LEAP CLASSIFICATIONS OUT OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY STATEWIDE CLASSIFICATIONS THAT CAL H. R.. ADMINISTERS SO THAT MEANS THAT INDIVIDUALS GOING THROUGH THE LEAGUE PROGRAM DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY. TO PARTICIPATE IN ALL OF THOSE OTHER EXAMINATION PROCESS IS THROUGH THE LEE PROGRAM. AND SO THE BILL WOULD ASK CAL HR. TO MOVE FORWARD ON EXPANDING THE PROGRAM TO COVER OTHER STATEWIDE CLASSIFICATIONS. SECONDLY OUR CALLIE CHAR WOULD BE ASKED TO IDENTIFY DEPARTMENTS WITH THE LOWEST RATES OF HIRING OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND TO WORK WITH THEM TO ADOPT NEW STRATEGIES. TO IMPROVE THEIR HIRING PRACTICES AND REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE RESULTS OF THAT EFFORT. FINALLY -- BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED SB SIX FORTY FOUR WHICH ESTABLISHED AN INTERNSHIP PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES AS PART OF THE LEAGUE PROGRAM WHERE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO THROUGH. A FORMAL EXAMINATION PROCESS ARE ABLE TO COMPLETE AN ON THE JOB INTERNSHIP TO QUALIFY TO PARTICIPATE. IN A LEAP THIS BILL WOULD EXTEND EXT ELIMINATE THE SUNSET DATE FOR THAT PROGRAM AND ALSO ASK CAL HR AND OTHER AGENCIES TO WORK WITH US ON STUDYING THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPANDING THAT INTERNSHIP. OPTION TO BE AVAILABLE TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS WITH -- MOST SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES. SO IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD ON THESE KEY ISSUES WE VERGE HERE I VOTE ON A. B. THREE SIXTY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN CINDY SMITH THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AS A STATE AGENCY WE ARE COMMITTED TO HIRING INDIVIDUALS DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES. AS WELL AS WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE IMPROVEMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE THE PLEA PROGRAM SOMEWHERE IN STRONG SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. SEEN ON ANY QUESTION BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEN HERE IN AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER ID LIKE TO CLOSE. THIS ONE AT BANK MORALE FOR COMING OUT ENSURING THE STORY WITH THAT. AND I LOOK FORWARD. FIFTY MORE OUT FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS -- BE ABLE. TO DO A LOT OF TASK HERE -- IN THE CAPITAL INFLAMMATION MORALE AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE -- AS THEY GET INTO THAT RETIREMENT AGE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WITHOUT ALSO LIKE TO THANK MORE OFFER COMING FORWARD AND SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE BILL. AND WITH AUTHOR I AGREE WITH THE GOALS OF THE BILL THAT WE SHOULD MAKE. MORE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE. IN STATE SERVICE TO INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES WHAT THE SAME THING AS ANYONE ELSE LIKE A GOOD JOB. AND BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE FAMILY SO WITH THAT I RECOMMEND AN AYE VOTE AND I LIKE TO GET A MOTION AND SECOND. THE MOTION BY MISTER BONTA SEKHEMRE MISTRAL DONNA. SECRETARY LIKE CALL THE ROLL YES AB THREE SIX FIVE MOTIONS DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS RODRIGUEZ HI. RODRIGUEZ AYE VOEPEL. THE BILL I CERVANTES. CERVANTES I COOLEY. COOPER. COOPER IPHONE. O'DONNELL. RIGHT O'DONNELL AYE. IN WILL KEEP IT ON CALL BUT WITH MOTIONS THAT THANK YOU CAME. THE NEXT [inaudible] ONE DOES NOT [inaudible] SO [inaudible] QUESTION. ALL RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN AFTER SOME. AND WHAT MEMBERS NUMBER QUINN DOWN THAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE BOARDS. OF CALPERS AND CAL STIRS TO DIVEST PUBLIC EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT FUNDS FROM ANY INVESTMENT VEHICLE. ISSUED BY OWNED CONTROLLED OR MANAGED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY. THE LIQUIDATION OF INVESTMENTS IN TURKEY IS CONTINGENT UPON THE PASSAGE OF A FEDERAL LAW ISSUING SANCTIONS. AGAINST TURKEY FOR FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. SO THERE IS A HIGH BAR PROTECTING THE INVESTMENTS OF CALIFORNIANS SET -- THIS CONTINGENCY CLAUSE INSURERS CALIFORNIA'S POLICY TO DIVEST FROM TURKEY REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH PAST INVESTMENTS FROM FOREIGN NATIONS INCLUDING SU DON AND IRAN. IN THAT PURRS AND STIRS WILL NOT DIVEST UNTIL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN ACTION FIRST ALSO THIS BILL INCLUDES A PROVISION PROTECTING THE BOARDS OF CALPERS AND CAL STIRS BY STATING ACTIONS TAKEN. TO ALIGN WITH THIS BILL ARE NOT REQUIRED IF THEY VIOLATE THE BOARD'S FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES. FURTHER THERE'S A PROVISION INDEMNIFY AND THE BOARDS AND EMPLOYEES FROM CLAIMS BROUGHT FORTH BY ACTIONS TAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS BILL. REPUBLIC OF TURKEY'S UNWILLINGNESS TO RECOGNIZE THE GENOCIDE AND THEIR UNRELENTING CAMPAIGN TO DENY THE GENOCIDE CONTINUES TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ARMENIANS. AND OTHER ETHNIC MINORITIES WHO SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE TURKISH OTTOMAN GOVERNMENT. CALIFORNIA HAS CLEAR POLICY ON THE GENOCIDE AS DEMONSTRATED BY DECADES OF LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTIONS AND GUBERNATORIAL PROCLAMATIONS. CALIFORNIANS INVESTMENT IN TURKISH GOVERNMENT BONDS INDIRECTLY SUBSIDIZES TURKISH THE NILE OF THE GENOCIDE. THIS BILL CONTINUES CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO ACT APPROPRIATELY AGAINST COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A RECORD OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY -- WITH ME I'M JOINED BY ME RUN TO MY CHEN WITH THE ARMENIAN ASSEMBLY OF AMERICA. THANK YOU GóMEZ YOU READY. CHAIRMAN RODRIGUEZ VICE CHAIRMAN VOEPEL. AND FELLOW DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RETIREMENT. UP MY NAME IS MEHRAN TO MUCH AND I SERVICE THE WESTERN REGION DIRECTOR OF THE ARMENIAN ASSEMBLY OF AMERICA A NATIONWIDE NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION COMMITTED TO PROMOTING PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING. AND AWARENESS OF ARMENIAN ISSUES. MY ORGANIZATION WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORTS ASSEMBLY BILL. AB. THIRTEEN TWENTY AUTHORED BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN WITH PRINCIPAL CO AUTHORS FRIEDMAN AND GABRIEL [inaudible] UP. MY ORGANIZATION AMONG ITS EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES OF PRODUCES RESOURCES FOR EDUCATORS ABOUT THE NATURE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. AND ON THE UNIVERSAL IMPERATIVE OF GENOCIDE PREVENTION. THROUGHOUT THE PAST FIVE DECADES CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AN EXAMPLE -- TO FELLOW STATES WITH RESPECT TO THE ADOPTION OF RESOLUTIONS AND PROCLAMATIONS COMMEMORATING THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. IN ADDITION TO THE PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION MANDATING THE TEACHING THE GENOCIDE AND STATEWIDE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ALONGSIDE THE HOLOCAUST. AND OTHER MODERN. MODERN ERA MASS ATROCITIES IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE GOLDEN STATE'S CLEAR POSITION ON GENOCIDE RECOGNITION AND EDUCATION THE TURKISH STATE MANDATES THE TEACHING OF GENOCIDE DENIAL IN ITS SCHOOLS AND CONTINUES A CENTURIES OLD POLICY OF DISCRIMINATION. TOWARDS ARMENIANS AND OTHER MINORITY POPULATIONS. IN RECENT YEARS TURKEY CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD HAS BEEN ABYSMAL. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE UNDER ARTICLE THREE A ONE OF THE PENAL CODE IN ARTICLE EIGHT OF THE ANTI TERROR ACT TURKISH JOURNALISTS ACADEMICS HUMAN RIGHTS AND CIVIL SOCIETY ADVOCATES. REPRESENTATIVE IS REPRESENTATIVES OF ITS LEGAL AND JUDICIAL COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND IMPRISONED FOR QUOTE UNQUOTE. INSULTING PUBLIC OFFICIALS OR QUOTE UNQUOTE CARRYING OUT CRIMES AGAINST THE STATE. MEMBERS OF TURKEY'S MINORITY COMMUNITIES INCLUDING KURDS A LEVEES ARMENIANS ASSYRIANS AND GREEKS HAVE ESPECIALLY BEEN TARGETED FOR ARREST AND IMPRISONMENT UNDER ARTICLE EIGHT AND THREE OH ONE IN ADDITION ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE TO PROTECT JOURNALISTS FOR THE THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR TURKEY MAINTAINS. ITS IGNOMINIOUS DISTINCTION AS THE WORST TAYLOR OF JOURNALISTS AND THE TO GUN REGIME REGULARLY REFERS TO IMPRISON JOURNALISTS AT LEAST SIXTY EIGHT ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE. TO PROTECT JOURNALISTS AS QUOTE UNQUOTE TERRORIST CHILD MOLESTERS AND MURDERS. TURNING TO CRITICAL REGIONAL ISSUES CONTRARY TO PRESIDENT ADVANCE BEEN TRICKY HAS NEITHER ACTED AS A GOOD FAITH PARTNER THE GLOBAL COALITION TO DEGRADE AND DEFEAT ISIS NOR HAS MADE STRIDES TO MITIGATE. THE SCOURGE OF TERRORISM AND ISLAMIC EXTREMISM IN THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST ACCORDING TO DAVID PHILLIPS DIRECTOR THE PEACE BUILDING AND HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRAM AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. THE TICKET STATE HAS MATERIALLY AIDED AND ABETTED ISIS. AS WELL AS THE AL QAEDA IN THE LABATT AND OTHER TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS WREAKING HAVOC IN SYRIA AND EIGHT ANY ROCK. PHILLIPS COLLECTED EVIDENCE OF ANKARA'S DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE OIL TRADE WITH ISIS ITS COMPLICITY IN ALLOWING TERRORISTS TO TRAVERSE INTO SYRIA AND IRAQ FROM TURKEY. AND ITS PROVISION OF OFFENSIVE WEAPONS MILITARY MATERIAL AND MEDICAL ATTENTION TO MEMBERS OF VARIOUS TERRORIST GROUPS. TURKEY'S REPRESSION TOWARDS ITS KURDISH MINORITY AND VIOLATIONS OF ITS NEIGHBORS TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY HAVE EXACERBATED TENSIONS IN THE REGION AND HEIGHTEN THE LEVEL OF RISK. FOR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT THE TENUOUS SECURITY SITUATION HAS HAD A DELETERIOUS EFFECT ON THE TURKISH ECONOMY WITH MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE RECENTLY RATING TURKEY S. BE A THREE NEGATIVE THREE NOTCHES BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE. AND FITCH RATINGS ISSUING GET BB NEGATIVE RATING OF TURKEY TWO NOTCHES BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE. RISING INFLATION IN TURKEY HOVERING AROUND 19220% IN MARCH TWENTY NINETEEN COUPLED WITH RAMPANT UNEMPLOYMENT A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF THE TURKISH LIRA AGAINST THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR AND THE EURO. SHOULD BE FACTORED INTO THE RISK ANALYSIS OF INVESTING IN TURKISH GOVERNMENT ISSUED AND CONTROLLED THAT SECURITIES AND BONDS. DESPITE THE HIGH RISK INVESTMENT SITUATION ON THE GROUND IN TURKEY CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC RETIREMENT SYSTEMS CALPERS AND CAL STIRS JOINTLY HOLD DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY. IN EXCESS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THE MARKET VALUE OF WHICH HAS EXPONENTIALLY SHRUNK OVER THE PAST YEAR IT WAS. VALUED AT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION LAST YEAR. NEVER THE LESS SUCH LARGE SCALE INVESTMENTS INDIRECTLY EIGHT IN A BET ON CARESS STATE SPONSORED POLICY TO DENY THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE AND REPRESSED VULNERABLE CITIZENS TODAY. THE PURPOSE OF AB THREE THIRTY TWENTY IS TO CRAFT A SENSIBLE POLICY WHICH REFRAINS FROM FINANCIALLY REWARDING AND INVESTING IN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. THAT UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY AND TRAMPLE UPON THE BASIC HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS OF ITS CITIZENS THE APPROVAL OF THIS BILL WOULD SEND A CLEAR SIGNAL TO RESIDENTS OF THE GOLDEN STATE. THAT CALIFORNIA VALUES INVESTMENT OPTIONS THAT ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS LEGISLATIVE POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES IN PROTECTING IN UPHOLDING UNIVERSAL HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS THE RULE OF LAW. AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WITHIN THE STATE AND THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE. INDEED AS THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY CALIFORNIA DEMONSTRATES AN EXAMPLE HISTORICAL RECORD OF LEADING THE WAY IN THE ADOPTION OF DIVESTMENT LEGISLATION. THE SOLID PRESIDENTIAL RECORD INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURES DIVESTMENT FROM SOUTH AFRICA SPEARHEADED BY THEN GOVERNOR DEUKMEJIAN INSIDE SLIGHTLY PRIOR TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. OWN DIVESTMENT LEGISLATION VIS A VIS SOUTH AFRICA FOR THE LATTER'S POLICY OF APARTHEID. AND AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER AS ARE YOU MENTIONED THERE'S ALSO PRESIDENT OF FOR DIVESTING FROM SIT DOWN AND ALSO FROM IRAN. THE ARMENIAN SO WE AMERICA BELIEVES THE AB THIRTEEN TWENTY OFFERS ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS WHICH HOLE PRESENT FORMER IN FUTURE BOARD MEMBERS OFFICERS EMPLOYEES AND THIRD PARTY INVESTMENT MANAGERS HARMLESS FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE. IN ADDITION WE SUPPORT MEASURES SUCH AS A. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY WHICH INCLUDE SAFEGUARDS TO MINIMIZE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT UPON EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES. FINALLY SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CASTERS IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN AND CALPERS IN NINETEEN THIRTY TWO THOUSANDS OF ARMENIAN AMERICAN RETIREES IN CALIFORNIA SPANNING BOTH PENSION SYSTEMS INCLUDING EDUCATORSENGINEERS ECONOMIST CIVIL SERVANTS. HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THEIR AND THEIR EMPLOYERS RESPECTIVE CONTRIBUTIONS THE BOAT SYSTEMS ARMENIAN AMERICAN RETIREES IN CALIFORNIA MAKE UP A SIGNIFICANT CONSTITUENCY OF THE STORIED HISTORIES OF CALPERS AND CAL STIRS. WITHOUT FURTHER ADO. I REITERATE MY ORGANIZATIONS STRONG SUPPORT FOR A BI THIRTEEN TWENTY AND ASK FOR AN ABLE I VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH THAT ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. SEEN ON ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE COMPORT. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS TING HUTCHINGS WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES -- REGRETFULLY OPPOSITION OF A. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY I WANT TO CLEAR THAT WE DO NOT OPPOSE -- YOU KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO IT TO DO WITH REGARDS TO THE MORAL IS SYMBOLIC IN NATURE OF OF THE POLICY -- BUT WE SIMPLY HAVE TO OPPOSE ANY MEASURE THAT PUTS IN JEOPARDY WHAT WE BELIEVE THAT WE WE BELIEVE THAT PUTS IN JEOPARDY ABOUT THE ONE POINT NINE MILLION. ACTIVE OR RETIRED EMPLOYEES IN THE CáC CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM. SIMPLY PUT DIVESTMENT DOESN'T WORK WE ARE YOU ARE TAKING AND AN ASSET OF VALUE YOU ARE SELLING IT -- TO TO A NON -- WHO I I KIND OF DOUBLES A NON CONSCIENTIOUS CONSCIENTIOUS AND MASTER -- AND THAT THAT IT WAS NO CHANGE IN CONTRAST WHEN WHEN -- CALPERS SHOWING DATING GAUGE WITH WITH STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE HAVE SEEN CHANGE FOR EXAMPLE. THERE WERE -- MEASURES LAST YEAR THAT WOULD MANDATED THE FIND I. BASS FROM -- RETAILERS WHO SELL HIGH POWERED FIREARMS -- THE BILL FORTUNATELY DID NOT MOVE I CALPERS DIE IN GAUGE WITH THOSE RETAILERS AND WE'VE SEEN AT RECENTLY THAT DICK'S SPORTING GOODS HAS NO LONGER DECIDE TO SELL HIGH POWERED FIREARMS IT'S WORKING WHEN WE ENGAGE USING OUR PROXY VOTING -- WORK WORKING WITH THESE COMPANIES -- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT'S AND DOESN'T WORK ENGAGEMENT DOES WORK WE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE REALLY IS NO MORAL VICTORY WITH RETIREMENT SECURITY -- THE THE CHALLENGE WITH THE THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE DIVESTMENT BILLS IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO TAKE AWAY THE TOOLS THAT THE INVESTMENT TEAM NEEDS. BY. ABOUT THE SAME TIME KICKING THEM FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET THEIR BEST RETURNS AND WHILE THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT SAYS THEY HAVE TO CITE THE PURDUE SHARE RESPONSIBILITY. FISHER RESPONSIBILITIES VERY -- AT UP FOR INTERPRETATION THE CALPERS BOARD -- USED THEIR PRODUCE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DIVEST FROM THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY -- THAT'S ALL FINE AND GOOD EXCEPT FOR ITS COST THE FUND ABOUT TEN TO TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN POTENTIAL LOSSES. THE JUSTIFICATION FOR SUCH WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS LAWSUIT THAT WERE PENDING AGAINST TOBACCO COMPANIES THERE FOR THE SHARES COULD BE GOING DOWN. USING THEIR PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY THERE INDEMNIFIED THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INDEMNIFIED ARE THE ACTIVE EMPLOYEES RETIREES IN THE AGENCIES THAT ARE THE INSURERS OF ANY LOSS THAT THE DIVESTMENT DOES CREATE. THE THE FIND IS THAT 65% FUNDED THAT IS SIXTY FIVE CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT AS TO AN ACTIVE OR RETIRED EMPLOYEE. THE FIGHT DE THE PERSPECTIVE RETURNS FOR THIS YEAR BOB WILL LIKELY NOT HIT THE 7% MARK. THAT IS ANOTHER THAT IS YET GOING TO BE YET ANOTHER -- STOPGAP WERE EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES HAVE TO MAKE UP THAT DIFFERENCE -- THE NUMBERS WE'VE SEEN HOVER AROUND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT -- THAT. THE CALPERS STAFF AND CAL STAR STAFF HAVE TO NOW GO THROUGH AND SEEK OUT INDIVIDUALS SPECIALIZE INDEX FUNDS GO THROUGH AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE INDEX FUNDED THERE THAT THEY'RE INVESTING AND DOES NOT HAVE ITS HOLDINGS. OTHERS FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AS WELL -- WEEK COMPLETELY GET AND UNDERSTAND -- THE THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS -- BUT DIVESTMENT AS A PRINCIPAL WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED WE SIMPLY CANNOT SUPPORT A MEASURE THAT PUTS AT RISK THE MILLIONS OF ACTIVE AND RETIRED A PUBLIC EMPLOYEES WHO DEPEND. ON THEIR PENSIONS -- MOVING FORT SO I WITH THAT RESPECT THE OPPOSE -- ANYONE ELSE IN A CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DEAL GIVENS WITH CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION LIKE TO APPLY MY COMMENTS WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES -- A A GET A GREATLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC -- POWER WITH REGARD TO DIVEST SPENT.

HE'S BEEN VERY UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE THIS IS A A VERY SENSITIVE TOPIC -- HOWEVER WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES -- TO CALPERS INVESTMENT POLICIES WE BELIEVE AS THE LEAGUE SAID THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AT CALPERS TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE FUND -- REMAIN OPEN TO THE TO THE STAFF THERE CALPERS AND WE DON'T TIE THEIR HANDS AND AN ADVERT LEE. COST. THE RETIREES AND THEIR PENSIONS. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE POSTED THIS LEGISLATION.
