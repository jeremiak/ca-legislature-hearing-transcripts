INTEREST AND MAKE YOU FEEL SO

00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:52.563 region:rollup2
INADEQUATE. THAT YOU REALLY

DON'T KNOW OUR HISTORY THAT WE

00:53:52.563 --> 00:53:55.065 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW OUR COMPLETE HISTORY

00:53:53.931 --> 00:53:56.967 region:rollup2
AND AS A RESULT OF NOT KNOWING

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:58.035 region:rollup2
IT WE SHOULD BE STRIVING EVERY

00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:59.970 region:rollup2
DAY TO KNOW MORE AND MORE ABOUT

00:53:58.035 --> 00:54:01.872 region:rollup2
OURSELVES.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:03.974 region:rollup2
ROBERTS HISTORY REMINDS US OF

00:54:01.872 --> 00:54:05.843 region:rollup2
JUST HOW HARD IT WAS FOR A

00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:07.144 region:rollup2
PERSON TO WORK TO GET ELECTED.

00:54:05.843 --> 00:54:07.978 region:rollup2
EVEN IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

00:54:07.144 --> 00:54:10.013 region:rollup2
THERE WERE NO OTHER ROLE MODELS

00:54:07.978 --> 00:54:11.515 region:rollup2
FOR HIM TO LOOK TO.

00:54:10.013 --> 00:54:13.150 region:rollup2
HE HE FELT HE WAS AN AMERICAN HE

00:54:11.515 --> 00:54:14.318 region:rollup2
KNEW HE WAS AN AMERICAN

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:16.153 region:rollup2
AND HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE IN THIS

00:54:14.318 --> 00:54:17.488 region:rollup2
HOUSE IN ON THIS FLOOR.

00:54:16.153 --> 00:54:19.890 region:rollup2
AND AS A RESULT HE SERVICE

00:54:17.488 --> 00:54:21.625 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN YEARS FOR THE STATE OF

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:23.360 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MAKING SIGNIFICANT

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:25.095 region:rollup2
CHANGES AND MOST OF US DIDN'T

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:26.463 region:rollup2
ALWAYS NAME UNTIL WE CAME IN

00:54:25.095 --> 00:54:27.998 region:rollup2
DISCOVERED IN THIS RECORD BOOK.

00:54:26.463 --> 00:54:29.399 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WAS AN

00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:30.868 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICAN WHO PAVE THE

00:54:29.399 --> 00:54:31.869 region:rollup2
WAY FOR OTHER AFRICAN AMERICANS

00:54:30.868 --> 00:54:33.337 region:rollup2
TO COME AND OTHERS TO COME TO

00:54:31.869 --> 00:54:34.805 region:rollup2
THIS HOUSE.

00:54:33.337 --> 00:54:36.607 region:rollup2
SO IT SHOULD REMIND US OF JUST

00:54:34.805 --> 00:54:38.575 region:rollup2
HOW RICH OUR HISTORY IS

00:54:36.607 --> 00:54:39.643 region:rollup2
AND HOW MUCH WE DON'T KNOW. AS I

00:54:38.575 --> 00:54:41.178 region:rollup2
POINTED OUT LAST NIGHT AFTER

00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:42.346 region:rollup2
HAVING STUDIED AND TAUGHT

00:54:41.178 --> 00:54:44.148 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY FOR

00:54:42.346 --> 00:54:45.883 region:rollup2
OVER FORTY YEARS.

00:54:44.148 --> 00:54:47.584 region:rollup2
EVERY DAY I LEARN SOMETHING NEW.

00:54:45.883 --> 00:54:49.586 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES ME FEEL INADEQUATE

00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:50.220 region:rollup2
THAT I DIDN'T HAVE THE EDUCATION

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:50.921 region:rollup2
I NEEDED WITH ALL THE DEGREES I

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.223 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:54:50.921 --> 00:54:54.825 region:rollup2
TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE DEPTH

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:56.827 region:rollup2
OF THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

00:54:54.825 --> 00:54:58.362 region:rollup2
TO APPRECIATE EVERY CALIFORNIA

00:54:56.827 --> 00:55:00.230 region:rollup2
BUT NOT ONLY THAT NOT ONLY HIS

00:54:58.362 --> 00:55:01.965 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS TO US WOULD JUST

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:02.800 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT HE KNEW EARL WARREN.

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:05.002 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.937 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTIONS OF EARL WARREN TO

00:55:05.002 --> 00:55:08.672 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

00:55:06.937 --> 00:55:10.307 region:rollup2
PROBABLY WAS INFLUENCED BY HIS

00:55:08.672 --> 00:55:12.009 region:rollup2
FRIENDSHIP AND RELATIONSHIP WITH

00:55:10.307 --> 00:55:13.644 region:rollup2
THIS GENTLEMAN. THAT HE KNEW ON

00:55:12.009 --> 00:55:15.546 region:rollup2
A PERSONAL LEVEL TO UNDERSTAND

00:55:13.644 --> 00:55:16.647 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WAS SOME HUMANITY VIA

00:55:15.546 --> 00:55:18.215 region:rollup2
THAT NEED TO BE SOME FAIRNESS

00:55:16.647 --> 00:55:19.583 region:rollup2
AND SOME SOME EFFORT TO TRY TO

00:55:18.215 --> 00:55:20.851 region:rollup2
CREATE SOME SENSE OF EQUALITY

00:55:19.583 --> 00:55:22.052 region:rollup2
FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL.

00:55:20.851 --> 00:55:23.487 region:rollup2
AND SO WE NEVER KNOW EVERY DAY

00:55:22.052 --> 00:55:25.088 region:rollup2
WHO WE MEET.

00:55:23.487 --> 00:55:26.590 region:rollup2
BUT WE KNOW THAT EACH ONE OF US

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:28.625 region:rollup2
A MAKING HISTORY IN SOME VERY A

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:29.193 region:rollup2
POSITIVE WAY. AND WE HAVE TO

00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:30.527 region:rollup2
WORK VERY HARD TO ACCOMPLISH

00:55:29.193 --> 00:55:31.395 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:55:30.527 --> 00:55:32.863 region:rollup2
SO BLACK ISSUE JUST SIMPLY

00:55:31.395 --> 00:55:33.964 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO REMIND

00:55:32.863 --> 00:55:35.299 region:rollup2
ME THAT NO I CAN'T LEARN IT ALL

00:55:33.964 --> 00:55:36.800 region:rollup2
IN A MONTH.

00:55:35.299 --> 00:55:38.368 region:rollup2
BUT I DISCOVERED I HAVE LEARNED

IN WOMEN'S HISTORY. AND WHEN WE

DO NOT GIVE ALL OF US THE SPACE

00:55:49.046 --> 00:55:51.148 region:rollup2

ELEVEN PERCENT OF THE UNION ARMY

WORLD WAR ONE.

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:51.608 region:rollup2
SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AFRICAN

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:57.080 region:rollup2
STEVEDORES AND SUPPLY PEOPLE.

01:06:55.278 --> 01:06:59.148 region:rollup2

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.550 region:rollup2
OF THE RARE ROOMS.

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:02.619 region:rollup2

BACKING.

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:05.054 region:rollup2
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN DEEP

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:07.690 region:rollup2
TROUBLE.

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:10.560 region:rollup2
AND THEY WERE.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:12.762 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST GREATLY.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.731 region:rollup2
BUT THEY STILL DID THEIR JOB.

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:16.466 region:rollup2
STILL DID IT.

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:20.003 region:rollup2
WORLD WAR TO WAS EVEN MORE

01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:22.272 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATICAL TO SOME EXTENT.

01:07:20.003 --> 01:07:24.374 region:rollup2
ONCE AGAIN TWO THIRDS OF THE

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:26.142 region:rollup2
SUPPLY LINES WERE RUN BY AFRICAN

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:28.144 region:rollup2
AMERICANS ESPECIALLY THE RED

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:31.915 region:rollup2
BALL EXPRESS WHICH PUT HIGH

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:33.550 region:rollup2
PRIORITY PARTS AND. BACK UP TO

01:07:31.915 --> 01:07:35.818 region:rollup2
KEY UNITS

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.686 region:rollup2
THE NINETY SECOND DIVISION.

01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:37.820 region:rollup2
BUFFALO SOLDIERS

01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:39.789 region:rollup2
FOUGHT.

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:41.591 region:rollup2
AND FOUGHT.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:43.293 region:rollup2
HAD UP PER CAPITA HIGHER

01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:45.461 region:rollup2
CASUALTY RATE MUCH LIKE THE

01:07:43.293 --> 01:07:46.829 region:rollup2
JAPANESE FOR FOR TO COMBAT

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:49.832 region:rollup2
REGIMENT.

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:51.568 region:rollup2
THEY FOUGHT.

01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:54.504 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THEY WENT BACK HOME.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:57.173 region:rollup2
LEADING GET MUCH OF A PARADE.

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:58.741 region:rollup2
THE BIG BREAKTHROUGH CAME.

01:07:57.173 --> 01:08:01.344 region:rollup2
BY PRESIDENT.

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:03.379 region:rollup2
TRUMAN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE.

01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:04.914 region:rollup2
WHEN WE FULLY DESEGREGATED THE

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:06.883 region:rollup2
MILITARY AND OF COURSE THE

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:09.118 region:rollup2
ADMIRALS AND GENERALS PREDICTED

01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:09.619 region:rollup2
THE MILITARY WOULD COLLAPSE.

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:12.355 region:rollup2
WELL THAT BRINGS THIS TO

01:08:09.619 --> 01:08:14.924 region:rollup2
VIETNAM.

01:08:12.355 --> 01:08:17.293 region:rollup2
IN VIETNAM.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:19.429 region:rollup2
I WILL GUARANTEE YOU BULLETS AND

01:08:17.293 --> 01:08:22.265 region:rollup2
SHRAPNEL DID NOT CHECK THE

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:24.734 region:rollup2
MELANIN LEVEL OF THE VICTIM.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:27.003 region:rollup2
EVERYONE GOT HIT EQUALLY.

01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:29.105 region:rollup2
AND AFRICAN AMERICANS HAD A

01:08:27.003 --> 01:08:32.609 region:rollup2
HIGHER PER CAPITA CASUALTY RATE.

01:08:29.105 --> 01:08:35.478 region:rollup2
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:36.045 region:rollup2
TWO THEORIES THEIR NUMBER ONE.

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:37.547 region:rollup2
THEY WERE ALWAYS PUT AT THE

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:38.781 region:rollup2
FRONT.

01:08:37.547 --> 01:08:40.984 region:rollup2
WHICH I BELIEVE I'VE OBSERVE

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:42.285 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER TO.

01:08:40.984 --> 01:08:43.820 region:rollup2
THEY ENDED UP IN MOST OF THE

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:45.288 region:rollup2
COMBAT UNITS

01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:46.389 region:rollup2
FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY WORK

01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:48.458 region:rollup2
JUST REGULATED TO DEMEAN

01:08:46.389 --> 01:08:49.292 region:rollup2
SUPPLIES.

01:08:48.458 --> 01:08:51.995 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THEY GOT A CHANCE TO

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:54.864 region:rollup2
FIGHT. THEY FOUGHT.

01:08:51.995 --> 01:08:56.532 region:rollup2
THAT BRINGS US TO TODAY.

01:08:54.864 --> 01:08:58.301 region:rollup2
TWELVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION

01:08:56.532 --> 01:08:59.669 region:rollup2
IS AFRICAN AMERICAN SIXTEEN TO

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:00.269 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN PERCENT IS IN THE

01:08:59.669 --> 01:09:02.305 region:rollup2
MILITARY IN A REASON FOR THAT

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:05.141 region:rollup2
IS.

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:06.809 region:rollup2
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY.

01:09:05.141 --> 01:09:09.579 region:rollup2
YOU ARE TREATED EQUALLY IN THE

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:12.215 region:rollup2
MILITARY AFRICAN AMERICANS KNOW.

01:09:09.579 --> 01:09:15.284 region:rollup2
THAT IS A TICKET LIKE FOR ME OUT

01:09:12.215 --> 01:09:18.321 region:rollup2
OF POVERTY. AND TO EDUCATION.

01:09:15.284 --> 01:09:19.455 region:rollup2
SO I GREATLY SUPPORT HR SEVENTY

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:23.926 region:rollup2
FIVE.
