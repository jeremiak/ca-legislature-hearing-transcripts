AUTISTIC STUDENTS BUT THAT

00:54:32.902 --> 00:54:34.804
MEANS THAT IT IS MUCH MORE

00:54:34.871 --> 00:54:37.707
DIFFICULT THAN- I THINK THE

00:54:37.774 --> 00:54:49.719

THEY THRIVE BUT THERE'S OTHER

00:55:02.298 --> 00:55:04.334
TIMES WHERE PARTICULARLY WITH

TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE SITTING IN A

00:55:06.136 --> 00:55:08.271

DIFFERENT TYPES- AND IT'S VERY

00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:14.177
QUIET PLACE AND THEY CAN. VERY

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:19.416

THIS PROBLEM- EVER AS A READ

01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:15.122
FIRST. THE WHAT'S BEFORE US

01:43:15.188 --> 01:43:16.890
TODAY IN SHORT THAT STUDENTS

01:43:16.957 --> 01:43:18.592
ABSENCES FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:43:18.659 --> 01:43:20.494
CONCERNS ARE DEALT WITH ON PAR.

01:43:20.561 --> 01:43:21.862
WITH THE WAY SCHOOLS EXCUSE

01:43:21.929 --> 01:43:23.997
ABSENCES FOR PHYSICAL HEALTH AS

01:43:24.064 --> 01:43:25.365
ORIGINALLY DRAFTED THIS BILL

01:43:25.432 --> 01:43:26.900
WOULD HAVE SPOKEN DIRECTLY TO

01:43:26.967 --> 01:43:27.734
THE NEED OF MANY SCHOOL

01:43:27.801 --> 01:43:29.236
PERSONNEL WHO COULD BENEFIT

01:43:29.303 --> 01:43:31.371
FROM TRAINING. FOR IDENTIFY YOU

01:43:31.438 --> 01:43:32.906
THROUGHOUT THAT HAVE A BIGGER

01:43:32.973 --> 01:43:34.341
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:36.043
MAKE APPROPRIATE REFERRALS SO

01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:36.777
THEY COULD GET THE HELP THEY

01:43:36.843 --> 01:43:38.745
NEED. A SIMILAR VERSION OF THIS

01:43:38.812 --> 01:43:40.814
BILL THAT WAS PROPOSED PRIOR TO

01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:41.481
PANDEMIC MADE IT TO THE

01:43:41.548 --> 01:43:45.586
GOVERNOR'S DESK. WITH THE

01:43:45.652 --> 01:43:46.186
REQUIREMENT FOR TEACHERS TO BE

01:43:46.253 --> 01:43:48.855
TRAINED. SO WHY PUSH FORWARD

01:43:48.922 --> 01:43:50.791
WITHOUT THAT YOU KNOW FRANKLY.

01:43:50.857 --> 01:43:53.160
EVERY STEP FORWARD. IS

01:43:53.226 --> 01:43:54.828
INCREMENTAL TOWARDS DEEPENING

01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:56.964
THE STIGMATIZING MENTAL HEALTH

01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:58.498
BUT I ALSO THINK OF THE FATHER

01:43:58.565 --> 01:44:00.133

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:01.602

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:07.474
SIMON. GOT A GRADE AND I TOOK

01:44:07.541 --> 01:44:09.776
HER OWN LIFE. THE FATHER DIDN'T

01:44:09.843 --> 01:44:11.478
BLAME THE TEACHER FOR NOT

01:44:11.545 --> 01:44:13.246
SEEING THE SIDES OF SUICIDE.

01:44:13.313 --> 01:44:14.581
BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZED THAT THE

01:44:14.648 --> 01:44:15.749
TEACHER WAS NOT TRAINED TO

01:44:15.816 --> 01:44:17.884
RECOGNIZE THEM. FRANKLY I

01:44:17.951 --> 01:44:19.252
BELIEVE THAT THAT TRAINING WILL

01:44:19.319 --> 01:44:21.455
SAVE LIVES MEMBERS WE HAVE TO

01:44:21.521 --> 01:44:22.789

STIGMA FOR MENTAL HEALTH
