AND WE NEED A LOT MORE OF THESE AYE INCREMENTAL EFFORTS TOWARDS GETTING A SKILLED TRAINED WORKFORCE WE'VE GOT A CRISIS GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ARE OBVIOUSLY THIS CONTRIBUTING TO A SUMMER ECONOMIC WOES IS CONTRIBUTING TO OUR HOUSING CRISIS. WHICH OF COURSE RESULT IN HOMELESSNESS ISSUE AND. OTHER SO IT'S GREAT TO SEE. YOU TAKING STEPS TO ON. ADDRESS THE WORK FOR SHORTAGE OF A DIFFERENT BILL FOR NOT BE SUPPORTED TODAY. AND I QUESTIONS. JAKE CLOSE. RESPECT FOR ABSTRACT ABOUT. AND ARE YOU ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. SECOND. GROWING FOR A QUORUM SO WILL MAKE A RECOMMENDATION AS SOON AS WE HAVE ONE. MOVING TO ITEM THREE AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE COVER YOUR OWN. YOU MAY OPEN. MEMBERS OF THE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND PLEASE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WHICH WILL MAKE UP FOR SOME THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS SPELL. AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE WILL MAKE THAT STATE CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSES CREDIT REFUNDABLE. SO THAT LOW AND MODERATE INCOME WORKING FAMILIES CAN BENEFIT FROM THE CREDIT TO ASSIST WITH THEIR CHILD CARE EXPENSES. CALIFORNIA CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSES CREDIT ALLOWS TAXPAYERS WITH INCOMES BELOW ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REDUCE THEIR TAX LIABILITY BY A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THEIR LA. ELIGIBLE CHILDCARE EXPENSES IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE STATE MADE THAT CREDIT NON REFUNDABLE DUE TO BUDGET SHORTFALLS WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE NON REFUNDABLE CREDIT ONLY PROVIDES BENEFITS. TO FAMILIES THAT. STATE INCOME TAXES WHICH MEANS THAT LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES ARE EXCLUDED EVEN THOUGH THEY FACE RISING CHILDCARE EXPENSES BASICALLY IF YOU EARN UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU DON'T. GENERALLY OWE TAXES AND SO YOU CAN'T CLAIM THIS. THIS IS A CREDIT UP WE KNOW THAT THE COST OF CHILDCARE IS EXPENSIVE. AND IS AN INCREASING BURDEN FOR CALIFORNIA'S WORKING FAMILIES FROM THE MOST URBAN TO MOST RURAL COUNTIES. CHILDCARE COSTS ARE SOARING. AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE WILL HELP WORKING FAMILIES MEET THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES OF RAISING A FAMILY AND ACCESSING QUALITY CHILDCARE. MAKING THE CREDIT REFUNDABLE AGAIN WILL PUT MONEY BACK IN THE POCKETS OF WORKING FAMILIES SO THAT THEY CAN PAY FOR BASIC NEEDS LIKE FOOD HOUSING AND MEDICAL CARE. HERE WITH ME THEY DETEST FINDS IN SUPPORT I HAVE MICHELLE STILL WELL APARTMENTS KEY FROM THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA. AND CATIA AND SAY IT AND SAY WE FROM CALIFORNIA CHILDCARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL NECK NETWORK I THINK I'M GONNA ASK YOU JUST HOLD ON ONE SECOND WHILE WE HAVE A QUORUM. WE CAN TAKE THEIR OFF. BURKE THERE. BROUGH ALLEN BONTA. CHIU. GRAY HERE ACCARDI. MELENDEZ MULLIN BLOOM. COR. CUBA HAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WISH ALSO PREVENTS PEOPLE IF THE. CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE PROUD THE SPONSOR AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE CALIFORNIA TRIAL INDEPENDENT. THERE EXPENSES TAX CREDIT IS BASED ON THE FEDERAL CREDIT AND SOME OF THEIR CHILD CARE COST. WHICH WE AS WE KNOW ARE RISING. UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT CREDIT FAILS TO REACH MANY LOW INCOME FAMILIES BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE REMOVED THE REFUND ABILITY IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. THAT MEANS A FAMILIES YOU DON'T HAVE STATE TAX LIABILITY EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE PAYING OTHER TAXES LIKE PROPERTY AND SALES TAX ARE UNABLE TO BENEFIT. AS MENTIONED FAMILIES EARNING UNDER ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AREN'T ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE CREDIT AND LEAD TO THE FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING THE MOST TO PAY FOR RISING CHILD CARE. UNDER AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE ALONE CAN FAMILY COULD RECEIVE A REFUNDABLE CREDIT OF UP TO A THOUSAND AND FIFTY DOLLARS WHICH IS ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF WHAT CHILD CARE COSTS ARE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WOULD MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN THEIR BUDGET. A ROBUST BODY OF RESEARCH SHOWS THE BENEFITS OF REFUNDABLE TAX CREDITS ESPECIALLY FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. PART IT'S LIKE THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IN THE CHILD TAX CREDIT. HE'S CREDIT INCREASE FAMILIES ECONOMIC RESOURCES AND ALSO. TO IMPROVE CHILD OUTCOMES CHILD HEALTH AND. EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES EVEN A SLIGHT INCREASE IN FAMILY INCOME MAKES A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE EVEN INTO ADULTHOOD FOR THOSE CHILDREN. AND GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE. PARTICULAR HARMLESS THAT CHILD POVERTY HAS ON YOUNG CHILDREN FUN DISCREDIT AND IT'S. FOCUS ON. ON CHILD CARE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL. MAKING A CREDIT REFUNDABLE WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL IN TERMS OF DECREASING THE COST OF CHILD CARE FOR FAMILIES. WHICH MADE SAID BY SOME TO. TO WORK AS WELL AND WE KNOW THAT THIS CREDIT IS ACTUALLY ONLY AVAILABLE FOR CHILDCARE EXPENSES THAT ARE REALLY. AND FINALLY AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE MAKES A SMALL STEP TOWARDS MAKING THE TAX CODE MORE APPLICABLE. WE KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT LOW INCOME FAMILIES TO A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME IN. TAXES STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND THIS WOULD HELP REBALANCE THAT. SO FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS AV TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE LONG OVERDUE POLICY THAT WILL HELP WORKING FAMILIES SUPPORT LOW INCOME CHILDREN. AND PROMOTE EQUITY. WE URGE I THINK. CAROLINE BIRD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES CAN YOU SAFELY WE. OUT THERE RESOURCE. NETWORK. AND PAIN THAT CO DIRECTOR. SEE AN INTERROGATION. WE ARE MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION EVERY OUR IN OUR CALIFORNIA. WELL HARD OURS INITIAL PURPOSE FORTY YEARS AGO WAS TO CONNECT FAMILIES TO THE CHILD CARE THAT THE. TODAY AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS ARE IN OURS HAD THE CAPABILITY OF FAMILIES ACCESS THE CARE THEY NEED WHEN AND WHERE THE. THE JURY PLUS YEAH A MAJOR BARRIER TO USING LICENSE. WHERE IS COST? ACCORDING TO OUR RECENTLY RELEASED TWENTY SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA CHILD CARE PORTFOLIO THE AVERAGE ANNUAL COST OF CENTER BASED CARE REDUCE FROM ELEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. TWENTY ONE THOUSAND THREE. AND THE COST OF FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME CARE IS SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS. BUT EVERY CHILD CARE CONCEDE GOT. UP TO A THIRD OF THE FAMILY'S MONTHLY BUDGETS AND LOWER INCOME SPACE LOWER INCOME FAMILIES FACE A MUCH HEAVIER BURDEN. YEAH CALIFORNIA'S ONLY TO SERVE ONE IN SEVEN CHILDREN WHO QUALIFY. SUCH AS. SO VERY TRUE INCOME ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIES BUT DOES NOT RECEIVE LINE WILL STAY. OVER FORTY PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME PER CHILD CARE. AND THOSE SAME FAMILIES ARE LIKELY TO QUALIFY FOR A REFUND FROM THE CHILD. CARE. EXPENSES CREDIT SHOULD AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE BECOME LAW. THIS BILL WOULD MAKE A SIGNIFICANT LOSS BROWN BY REINSTATING THE RESPONSIBILITY. BUT CALIFORNIA'S CREDIT. THIS IMPROVEMENT WILL HELP THE FAMILIES WHO NEED THE MOST HELP PAY FOR CHILD CARE. UNLIKE SOME OTHER STATE CHILDCARE CREDIT. CALIFORNIA CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE EXPENSES CREDIT AS WELL STRUCTURED SO THAT IT DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THE LOWEST INCOME. WHILE ONCE A YEAR FEDERAL CREDIT. TWO MONTHS EXPENSE. OF CHILD CARE REFUND FOR THOSE FAMILIES WHO QUALIFY WILL BE A MEANINGFUL INFUSION OF CASH. TO HELP THEM WITH THE COST OF CARE AND THE MONEY THEY RECEIVE. SO AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE WILL SUPPORT WORKING FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PROVIDE TO THEIR HOUSEHOLDS. WELL ALLOWING THEM TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN IN THE CHILD CARE SAY THEY GO ONLINE. FOR THESE REASONS WE ATTACK. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES UP IN SUPPORT. DOCTOR HERE RAVEN OUT WAS HE CAPTURES CALIFORNIA. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DON'T EVER BREAK. A NUMBER OF THE BILL. SECOND. THE MOTION IS TO PASSED APPROPRIATIONS BURKE. I BURKE GUY BRO. ALLEN BONTA. BONTA AYE CHU.

YOU MAY OPEN. ITEM NUMBER TWO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FIRST OFF LET ME START BY THANKING YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE LOOK FOR TO ACCEPTING THEIR COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND REALLY APPRECIATE ABOUT OF CHAIRWOMAN YOU ADDING ON AS A JOINT AUTHOR. AND WHAT EXTEND THAT OFFER TO ANYBODY ELSE ON THE COMMITTEE IF THEY'D LIKE TO ADD ON AS WELL AS A CO AUTHORS. AB TWO THOUSAND IT WOULD HELP TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY THE STATE BY EXEMPTING GRANTS RECEIVED FROM THE CARL MOYER MEMORIAL AIR QUALITY STANDARDS TEMA PROGRAM FROM STATE INCOME TAX. PROGRAM ASSIST BUSINESS OWNERS AND PUBLIC AGENCIES TO REPLACE HIGH POLLUTING VEHICLES WITH CLEANER A MISSION REDUCING ENGINES. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY AIR QUALITY ISSUES IN THE STATE HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES TO MEET ITS GOAL BECAUSE OF PROGRAMS LIKE THIS. HOWEVER THE PROGRAM A STRUGGLE TO GET SMALL BUSINESS AND INDIVIDUALS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM GIVEN THE HIGH UPFRONT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ACCEPTING THE GRANT. BY EXEMPTING THE GRANT FROM STATE INCOME TAX AB TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WOULD CREATE AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. AND INDIVIDUALS TO PARTICIPATE AND HELP OUR STATE BEAT ITS AIR QUALITY GOALS WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR. AND I VOTING I DO HAVE A TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. ANDCARE MEMBERS THAT MADE MY NEXT TIME JORDAN I'M WITH THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT. I WE'VE MASTERED THE CARL MOYER PROGRAM IN THE EIGHT COUNTIES TO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN A GREAT TOOL AND DIE IN ORDER TO GET EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM HEAVY DUTY MOBILE EQUIPMENT. BOTH IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THE SOUTH COAST WHERE WE HAVE TREMENDOUS AIR QUALITY CHALLENGES HEAVY EQUIPMENT THE SINGLE LARGEST EMISSION SOURCE THAT WE HAVE TO CONTROL THE CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS. AND WHILE THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. AS WE MOVE FORWARD REACHING OUT TO MORE AND MORE SMALL BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE THAT. THE UP FRONT COST IS REALLY AN ISSUE WHILE IT IS A GRANT PROGRAM WHEN PEOPLE PARTICIPATE IN A CAR LAWYER PROGRAM OFTENTIMES IF TAKING A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT WORKS JUST FINE FOR THEM NOW. AND THEY HAVE TO SCRAP THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WHEN THEY PURCHASE A NEW PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT'S LOWER EMISSIONS. SO THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT WITH IT THE GRANTS TYPICALLY ONLY PAY FOR ABOUT HALF THE COST OF THE NEW PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. AND SO. YEAH MORE MORE OFTEN WERE WRITING TO PEOPLE THAT ARE BASICALLY SAYING WE'D LIKE TO PARTICIPATE ABOUT THE UP FRONT COST ARE JUST TOO MUCH SO WE THINK THIS IS A. SENSIBLE WAY I TO MAKE SURE THE PROGRAMS REACHING ALL THE FOLKS AS WAS MENTIONED. THE VALLEY'S HOME TO TWENTY TO THIRTY MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THOSE COMMUNITIES AND AND GET A MAJOR REDUCTIONS IN THOSE AREAS WE THINK THIS WILL BE VERY HELPFUL. SO WE ASK FOR YOUR YOUR AYE VOTE ON EIGHTY TWO ZERO ZERO. I THINK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BOTTOM CHAIR MEMBERS BRING INTO IT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. OTHER CARL MOYER PROGRAM IS A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM COST EFFECTIVE AYE WE THINK THIS PROPOSAL WILL MAKE IT EVEN MORE ACCESSIBLE AND DATA WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT.

NOT JUST IN THE STATE A AS LONG AS WELL AS ON SOME OF THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES POVERTY. IN THE COUNTRY AND SO I ANY EFFORT TO. MADE COMMISSION REDUCTIONS IN AIR QUALITY ISSUES MORE AFFORDABLE AND AND HAVE A GREATER IMPACT. IS AN IMPORTANT EFFORT I THANK YOU FOR THE BILL AND ALL I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. BUT I JUST WANT TO REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS AGREED UPON THAT'S CLARIFYING THAT ALL MONETARY GRANTS UNDER THE PROGRAM ARE EXEMPT FROM STATE INCOME TAX. ALLOWS FTP TO VERIFY THE CLAIMED EXCLUSION AMOUNTS PROVIDE A FIVE YEAR SUNSET DATE DISALLOWS TAXPAYERS FROM CLAIMING MULTIPLE TAX BENEFITS FOR THE SAME ITEM AND EXPENSE.
