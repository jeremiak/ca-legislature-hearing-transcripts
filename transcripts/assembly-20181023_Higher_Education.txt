I AM ASSEMBLY MEMBER JOSE MEDINA CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON HIGHER EDUCATION. WHEN IT THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY? I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THE MATERIALS THAT ARE DISCUSSED AND HANDED OUT TODAY. CAN BE FOUND ON THE COMMITTEE WEBSITE. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THIS COMMITTEE HELD AN OVERSIGHT HEARING. TO BEGIN THE CONVERSATION OF HOW TO INCREASE. FACULTY DIVERSITY SYSTEM WIDE FOR ALL THREE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS. THE UC THE CSU AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. THIS HEARING IS PART OF THE FOLLOW UP BUT WILL FOCUS SOLELY ON THE UC SYSTEM. RESEARCH AND STUDENTS TELL US THAT A DIVERSE FACULTY CONTRIBUTES TO THE SUCCESS. OF A DIVERSE STUDENT BODY. THE STUDENTS THAT ATTEND UC. AND IMPROVES THE OVER ALL CAMPUS CLIMATE [inaudible] YET. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A SIGNIFICANT LACK. OF DIVERSITY AMONG FACULTY AT AMERICANS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. BLACK AND LIKE THE YOU KNOW FACULTY ARE PARTICULARLY UNDER REPRESENTED. AT RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES. THE PERCENTAGE OF UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS ENROLLED IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. HAS STEADILY INCREASE. BUT DESPITE NUMEROUS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE FACULTY DIVERSITY. PROGRESS TO INCREASE THE PROMOTION OF FEMALE AND UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY FACULTY HAS BEEN SLOW. IN THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT. THE ASSEMBLY SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED FOR SIX MILLION DOLLARS. TWO MILLION DOLLARS EACH FOR YOU SEE. CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO SUPPORT EQUAL EMPLOYMENT BEST PRACTICES. AND TO REPORT ON THE RACIAL ETHNIC AND GENDER COMPOSITION OF ITS FACULTY. THIS HEARING TODAY WILL REVIEW THE CURRENT STATUS OF FACULTY DIVERSIFICATION EFFORTS AT UC. AND PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MY COLLEAGUES AND MYSELF TO LEARN HOW UC HAS USE IT'S FUN. TO ADDRESS FACULTY DIVERSITY SYSTEM WIDE. AND TO LEARN OF SOME OF THE CAMPUS SPACE AS WELL. PLEASE NOTE THAT IN THE COMING LEGISLATIVE SESSION THERE WILL BE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. ON THE SAME TOPIC COVERING CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I I WOULD JUST ADD THAT I WAS RECENTLY AT THE REGENTS MEETING AT UCLA WHERE I HEARD THE REGION'S DISCUSSING THE SAME TOPIC THAT WE ARE HERE DISCUSSING TODAY. SO WE WILL BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST SPEAKERS TODAY WHO WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FACULTY DIVERSITY. AND THE CURRENT LEGAL LANDSCAPE BUT BEFORE I BRING UP. THE THE FIRST PANEL -- THANKFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM WHO JUST JOINED IS AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GIVE ANY OPENING REMARKS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM. I'M GLAD TO BE HERE AND I'M NOT CONTAGIOUS. WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE HERE BUT I CAN BARELY TALK SO. MY WIFE THINKS THAT'S A GOOD THING. THANK YOU FOR COMING. SO WITH THAT LET ME INTRODUCE. OF PRESIDENT OF FOOTHILL COLLEGE TUY T. NEWMAN [inaudible] EN. THE ADVOCACY DIRECTOR OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY SERRA RC. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBER. A MY NAME IS TWEETY WHEN I'M PRESIDENT OF FOOTHILL COLLEGE -- GOOD AFTERNOON ALSO TO ADD THE UC COLLEAGUES AND I SEE ALSO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE COLLEAGUES AND IN THE FOR MICHAEL HERE TODAY IS TWO FOLD. ONE IS TO TALK ABOUT THE WHY AND ALSO TO TALK ABOUT THE HOUSE. WHY IS FACULTY DIVERSITY IMPORTANT AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE IN LIGHT OF PROP TWO ALL NIGHT? BUT BEFORE I DO SO I FIRST OF ALL WANT TO THANK YOU ARE NOT ONLY FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE AND TO TRUST YOU. ABOUT ALSO TO KEEP THIS ISSUE IT MATTERS FOR OUR STUDENTS -- MIGHT I WILL TALK ABOUT. THE CONVERSATION OF FACULTY DIVERSITY AND IN YOUR PACKET YOU HAVE OF MY FLIGHTS BUT I WILL NOT GO THROUGH EACH SIDE INSTEAD. SPEAK LARGELY AND THEN ADDRESS OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE FLIGHT. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT FACULTY DIVERSITY IN THIS IS A CRITICAL QUESTION ACTUALLY IN THE LEGAL CONTEXT IT IS IMPORTANT TO STATE? IN OUR EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE ANALYSIS TO STATE WHY WHAT IS THE COMPELLING REASON FOR FACULTY DIVERSITY AND THE COMPELLING REASON. IS OUR STUDENTS. WE IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE ACTUALLY HAVE A SEMINAL CASE AND IT WAS ACTUALLY CONDUCTED BY A YOU SEE -- COLLIE A PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS OF DOING A RESEARCH HE WAS ACTUALLY DOING RESEARCH ON OF POVERTY ISSUES WITH REGARDS TO WORKFORCE AND HE STUMBLED ON SOME VERY COMPELLING DATA. AT OUR SISTER COLLEGE DIEM THE COLLEGE WHAT HE FOUND WAS THAT STUDENTS WHO WERE BEING EDUCATED BY FACULTY OF COLOR PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO FACULTIES. THAT THE EQUITY GAP ACTUALLY CLOSES UP 251%. AND IT WAS NOTHING THAT THE FACULTY MEMBERS DID BUT INSTEAD IT WAS HOW THE STUDENTS RECEIVED THE INFORMATION FROM THE FACULTY MEMBER. THIS IS REALLY CRITICAL IN THE CONVERSATION OF THE WHY AND OFTENTIMES WE SPEED THROUGH IT VERY QUICKLY BUT IT'S CRITICAL IN TERMS OF HAVING HARD DATA. HARD SCIENCE RESEARCH THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR WITH REGARDS TO FACULTY DIVERSITY AND REALLY ACTUALLY RESEARCH IN THE K. TWELVE HAS SHOWN THE FACULTY OF COLOR ACTUALLY BENEFIT ALL STUDENTS NOT JUST STUDENTS OF COLOR. I'M LET ME DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE FIVE THIS FIFTH SLIDE. AND THE CONCLUSION. OF OF THE THAT YOU SEE PROFESSOR UC SANTA CRUZ PROFESSOR OF ROBERT FARLEY HE FOUND STRONG POSITIVE IN ROOM BUS MINORITY INTERACTION EFFECTS FOR ALL OUTCOMES EXAMINED. THAT INCLUDES GRADES WHETHER THIS STUDENT STAYS IN THE CLASS WHETHER THEY PASSED ETCETERA. HE ALSO SQNG VERY SMALL VERY STRONG POSITIVE -- OWN RACE INTERACTION WITH FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS ALSO HAD STRONG STUDENT SUCCESS FOR LET DENOTE STUDENTS. OF BUT FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS THE THE EFFECT WAS EVEN STRONGER FROM A STUDENT SUCCESS STANDPOINT. AND WHAT HE FOUND WAS WHAT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN IS THAT ROLE MODELING THE FACT SO FEEL FREE. TO PULL DOWN HIS RESEARCH HE HAS DONE AND THIS IS THE RESEARCH THAT WE'VE BEEN USING IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FACULTY DIVERSITY. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE RESEARCH THAT LOCAL THAT'S REAL THAT'S LIVE AND ALL THAT WOULD BE ALSO A SUGGESTION FOR ALL COLLEAGUES DOING THE WORK IS TO REALLY HAVE RESEARCH THAT'S GROUNDED. AND REAL OF FOR OUR COLLEAGUES. HOW? NOW IN LIGHT OF OUR KNOWING THAT THIS IS COMPELLING THE QUESTION IS HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO THIS IN LIGHT OF PROP. TWO OH NINE AS YOU SEE AND SLIDE -- SET AT SIX OUTSIDE SEVEN YEARS PROP TWO ALL NINE OF AS YOU WE KNOW WAS A STUDENT INITIATIVE THAT BASICALLY SAID WE SHALL NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST OR GRANT PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT BASED ON RACE AND IN THE CONVERSATION WE HAVE TODAY. IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION A BILL TO TALK ABOUT FACULTY DIVERSITY WITHIN THE CONCEPT OF PROP. TWO OH NINE AND WHAT'S CRITICAL IS THE NEXT SLIDE AND IT'S SOMETHING WHEN I WAS IN TRUMP GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE STATE SYSTEM COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM OFFICE CANCERS OFFICE. IT WAS THE FRAMEWORK AND COMMUNICATION THAT I DID IN -- TRAINING OUR COLLEAGUES UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND THAT IS IT'S TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN. SO ONE SIDE OF THE COIN IS DEFINITELY ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS AND POP TOOL NINE THAT'S VERY CLEAR. BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND THE NEED TO PROMOTE INCLUSION. IT'S THE SAME SIDE OF THE SAME IT'S THE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN. KNOW WHY IS THIS CRITICAL. AS UC BERKELEY'S DEAN IRWIN SHIMMERING SKIER PREMIER CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR HAS SAID WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH PROP TWO OH NINE IS WE HAVE. BEEN PARALYZED IT MANY TIMES EVEN AT THE VERY BEGINNING WHEN PROP TWO ONE NINE WAS PUT IN PLACE AND QUITE FRANKLY EVEN AS OF THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS AT THE STATE'S SYSTEM OFFICE IN DOING THE TRAINING. AND GETTING LOCAL -- COLLEGE DISTRICT TRUSTEES TO VOTE ONFACULTY DIVERSITY AS A CRITICAL. ELEMENT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO ARE AFRAID OF EVEN USING THE WORD DIVERSITY. AND AFRAID THAT THAT CONCEPT ITSELF IS A VIOLATION OF PROP TWO OH NINE AND THAT IS NOT TRUE -- AND SO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OF THE SAME COIN AND CONSIDERING THE PARALYSIS OF ANALYSIS OF PROP TWO OH NINE OUT QUITE FRANKLY I THINK WE NEED TO SHOW ONE SIDE EVEN MORE SO BECAUSE OF THE LANGUAGE HAS BEEN MORE SO ON ONE SIDE. THAT SAID HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE FOR SYSTEM LEADERS TO BE ABLE TO INFUSE THAT SECOND SIDE OF THE COIN. WHAT WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IN THE PACKET IS IN EDUCATION CODE IN TITLE FIVE THERE IS A VERY SPECIFIC LANGUAGE AROUND DIVERSITY THERE'S VERY SPECIFIC LANGUAGE AROUND PROMOTION OF INCLUSION? THIS TYPE OF LANGUAGE IN LAW ACTUALLY ALLOWS US TO SHOW THAT OTHER SIDE OF THE SAME COIN AND SO I ENCOURAGE YOU AS YOU LOOK. INTO HOW WE CAN HELP OUR ALL OUR SYSTEMS AT IN THIS ARENA THAT IS ONE THING YOU CAN DO IS EMPHASIZE THAT OTHER SIDE THAT EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY. WHEN I WAS AT THE STATE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I ALSO PUT FORTH A LEGAL MEMO OF SPELLING OUT THE LEGAL PARAMETERS POP TOOL NINE AND OTHER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SAME COIN? AND I ALSO TALKED ABOUT FREE HIRING PROCESS SEES DURING HIRING PROCESS HE'S AND PULLS HIRING PROCESS THESE THOSE THREE HAVE TO BE THOUGHT OF VERY CLEARLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FACULTY DIVERSE STATE. ONE OF THE THINGS I ALSO TALKED ABOUT IN THE LEGAL OPINION IS AROUND HOW TO ANALYZE DATA. HOW DO YOU ANALYZE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT DESPERATE IMPACT ETCETERA? AND SO AS YOU WILL SEE IN -- SLIDE. FIFTEEN I LAID OUT A CHART. OF AND I TALKED ABOUT THE 80% RULE IN ANALYZING -- AND THE FOUR FIFTHS RULE IN ANALYZING DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT I ALSO TALK ABOUT EXCLUSIONARY AFFECT EXCLUSIONARY AFFECT IS ESSENTIALLY THE CONCEPT. OF SOMETHING THAT IS PUT FORTH AS A PROCESS A PRACTICE A RULE THAT ON ITS FACE IS NOT RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY BUT HAS AN EXCLUSIONARY. OF RACE DISCRIMINATION A ONE EXAM. IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WORLD IS THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATION TO BE A FACULTY IS A MASTERS DEGREE YET MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE A PEACH DE L. REQUIREMENT INSTEAD. AND CONSIDERING THE CHALLENGES ARE YOU SEE COLLEAGUES ARE HAVING AROUND. PHD CANDIDATES OF COLOR WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD THEN OF HAVING CANDIDATES OF COLOR. APPLYING TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN EFFORT TO INCREASE THE RIGOR AND YOU KNOW OF OF OF GRAVITAS OF OUR FACULTY MEMBERS WITH THE PHD. IT ACTUALLY HAS AN EXCLUSIONARY AFFECT FOR FOLKS OF COLOR MISSILE THINGS LIKE THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN ONE ANALYZES THE DATA AND I'M VERY GLAD ARE YOU SEE SYSTEM -- I SAW ALL THE INFORMATION FROM THE UCLA FOR INSTANCE WERE VERY MUCH MAKING THE CASE THE COMPELLING CASE FOR THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT OF FACULTY DIVERSITY. AND ALL OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE VERY RICH DATA IT'S TIME FOR US TO NOW GIVE SOME NUMERICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE STATUS AND DO SOME REGULAR ANALYSIS WHICH I'M SURE THEY'RE DOING BUT I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP IT IN THE FOREFRONT. ARE IN CLOSING I JUST WANT TO SAY IN MY LAST SLIDE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE REALLY BENEFITS GREATLY FROM THE UC SYSTEM AND ITS DIVERSIFICATION WE HAVE A LAW PATHWAY PROGRAM TWO PLUS TWO PLUS. THREE IS A STATE WIDE PATHWAY PROGRAM FOR OF LAW SCHOOLS FOR THE UC ARE HAVE SIGNED AN AMMO YOU WITH TWENTY SIX COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND TWENTY TWO HIGH SCHOOLS. TO REALLY CREATE THAT PIPELINE SO IT'S NOT JUST DIVERSIFICATION OF FACULTY BUT ALSO DIVERSIFICATION OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION WERE BY THE UC SYSTEM BECOMES A CRITICAL PARTNER FOR US. SO WITH THAT SAID I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN DO NOT -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON SUCH A CRITICAL TOPIC. MY NAME IS THERE ARE SEEING ON THE SENIOR POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY WE ARE NONPROFIT COALITION OF EDUCATION CIVIL RIGHTS AND BUSINESS LEADERS SEEKING TO EXPAND COLLEGE ACCESS. AND STUDENT SUCCESS IN CALIFORNIA FOR RESEARCH COALITION BUILDING AND POLICY ADVOCACY. EARLIER THIS YEAR RE RELEASED A GROUNDBREAKING GROUNDBREAKING REPORT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RACIAL AND GENDER INCLUSION IN HIGHER EDUCATION LEADERSHIP. IN SUPPORTING STUDENT SUCCESS THE REPORT ANALYZES STUDENT FACULTY AND SENIOR LEADERSHIP ACROSS OUR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS. IT FINDS THAT ARE COLLEGE LEADERS AND FACULTY ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STUDENTS EVEN WHILE WE KNOW THAT THESE LEADERS ARE KEY TO PRODUCING MORE COLLEGE GRADUATES IN CLOSING RACIAL EQUITY GAPS. ONE ONLY NEEDS TO SET FOOT ON ONE OF OUR PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES TO SEE THAT CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE TAPESTRY OF STUDENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE CLASSROOM. AS A YOUNG WITH THE NOT UC SANTA BARBARA I REALLY SAW MYSELF AND MY PROFESSORS OUR CAMPUS LEADERSHIP. LIKE MANY WE INTERVIEWED IT HAD AN IMPACT IN MY INITIAL COLLEGE EXPERIENCE AND CONFIDENCE OF BEING ON CAMPUS. TODAY I WILL SHARE A MAJOR FINDINGS FROM THE LEFT OUT REPORT AS IT RELATES TO THE LEADERSHIP AND FIGHT FACULTY DIVERSITY ANALYSIS WE DID FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA -- I WANT TO NOTE THAT THOSE STATISTICS I WILL BE -- MENTIONING ARE IN PAGES SIX AND NINE OF THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY YOU WERE PROVIDED. TO HELP BETTER UNDERSTAND THE LANDSCAPE -- WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION TO BE THE MOST DIVERSE IN THE WORLD A TREND THAT WILL ONLY INCREASE AS 76% OF K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS TODAY OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR. A WIDE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REFLECT THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STATE. NEARLY THREE A FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS OR 74% IDENTIFIED AS NON WHITE. STUDENTS AT THE UC ARE 39% ASIAN AMERICANS HAWAIIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER WHICH I WILL BE REFERRING TO AS ON P. FOR THE REST OF MY PRESENTATION. 26% LET NEXT 26% WHITE AND 4% AFRICAN AMERICAN. YET DESPITE THE RICH DIVERSITY OF OUR STUDENT BODY WITH A TRUE LACK OF DIVERSITY IN BOTH TENURED AND NON TENURED FACULTY POSITIONS AT THE UC. TENURED FACULTY AT THE UC ARE AND 3% AFRICAN AMERICAN. NON TENURED FACULTY AT THE UC OR AND 2% AFRICAN AMERICAN. RECOGNIZING IT THIS MISMATCHING REPRESENTATION WE KNOW THAT UNLESS INSTITUTIONS ARE INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHO THEY HIRE SIMPLY HIRING MORE FACULTY IN FULL TIME POSITIONS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MAKE THEM MORE DIVERSE. BECAUSE HIRING OFTEN OCCURS THROUGH EXISTING NETWORKS IT OFF IT TENDS TO REPLICATE RATHER THAN DISRUPT DEMOGRAPHIC PATTERNS. TO BE CLEAR IF PROFESSORS ARE ONLY REACHING OUT TO OTHER ACADEMICS THROUGH TRADITIONAL RECRUITMENT ROUTES AND NOT FOCUSED ON OTHER INTENTIONAL INCLUSIVE MEANS OF IDENTIFYING AND RECRUITING TALENTS. WE WILL NOT DIVERSIFY OUR FACULTY APPLICANT POOL WE WILL NOT HIRE MORE DIVERSE FACULTY AND WE WILL NOT DISTRACT INEQUITIES. AS CONCERNING AS THE STATISTICS MAYBE THAT DIVERSITY CHALLENGE AT THE YOU SEE IS ALSO ONE OF GENDER. FOLLOW MAJORITY OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ARE FEMALE FACULTY IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS FOR MAIN HEAVILY MALE. FACULTY POSITIONS THAT YOU SEE ARE HEAVILY SKEWED TOWARDS MEN WOMEN ONLY HOLD 33% OF TENURED POSITIONS ACROSS THE SYSTEM. THERE IS SOMEWHAT BETTER GENDER REPRESENTATION AND NON TENURED POSITIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WHICH 44% ARE OCCUPIED BY WOMEN. RACIAL INEQUITIES IN FACULTY REPRESENTATION ARE FURTHER COMPOUNDED IN REPRESENTATION AT THE ACADEMIC SENATE'S FOR THE CAMPUSES AND THE UNIVERSITY ITSELF. THIS IS CONCERNING GIVEN THE ROLE ACADEMIC SENATE'S PLAN ESTABLISHING POLICIES WHICH CAN DRAMATICALLY IMPACT THE ABILITY FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR TO ACCESS AND PRIVATE THE UNIVERSITY. ONE EXAMPLE OF ACADEMIC DECISION MAKING IS IN ANY CURRICULAR OR DEGREE CHANGES FOR INSTANCE ANY CHANGES TO COURSE REQUIREMENTS FOR MAJOR MUST BE APPROVED BY THE ACADEMIC SENATE. ANY PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH A NEW MAY CAN YOU MAJOR MUST BE APPROVED BY THE ACADEMIC SENATE. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THOSE IN POSITIONS TO INFLUENCE ECONOMIC POLICY SO SIGNIFICANTLY CAN UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCES OF THE STUDENTS IMPACTED YET WE FIND THAT BOTH THE CAMPUS AND SYSTEM LEVELS OF ACADEMICS SENATE'S. EIGHT OUT OF TEN MEMBERS ARE WHITE WEALTHIER THAN THREE OF TODAY'S YOU SEE STUDENTS ARE WHITE. ACADEMIC SENATE'S FOR UC CAMPUSES ARE 80% BY 11% ON P. 5% LATIN ACTS 3% AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND THE ACADEMIC CENTER FOR THE UNIVERSITY A LARGE THE MIRRORS THE SAME DATA. AS YOU NOTED IN THE MAY HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE MASTER PLAN SHERMAN T. NOW WE HAVE LONG LAMENTED THESE CHALLENGES AT THE UNIVERSITY. WE HOPE THAT TODAY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY BRING FURTHER ATTENTION ON THE NEED TO MAKE FACULTY AN ACADEMIC SENATE POSITIONS MORE INCLUSIVE BUT ALSO IDENTIFY PRACTICAL NEXT STEPS TOWARDS THAT END. IN THAT LIGHT WE'D LIKE TO OFFER SOME RECOMMENDATIONS. FIRST WE MUST ADDRESS THE FRONT END OF THE ISSUE BY UNDERSTANDING THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF APPLICANT POOLS FOR FACULTY POSITIONS. WE OFTEN HEAR THAT A BARRIER TO INCREASING FACULTY DIVERSITY IS AT THE APPLICANT POOL IS NOT DIVERSE. HOWEVER REPORT POINTS OUT THAT OVER THREE THOUSAND DIVERSE STUDENTS EARNED DOCTORATE DEGREES FROM THE CSU AND YOU SEE COMBINED MEETING THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR FACULTY POSITIONS AT UC CAMPUSES. GIVEN THAT WE KNOW THE DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATIONS ARE RECEIVING ADVANCED DEGREES MORE MUST BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT THE STUDENTS UNDERSTAND THEIR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE UC. ADDITIONALLY RECOGNIZING THE IMMENSE POWER THAT ACADEMIC SENATES HAVE MEMBERSHIP ROSTER SHOULD BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND UPDATED WITH DEMOGRAPHIC DATA. FINALLY WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S EFFORT AND TO INVEST IN FACULTY DIVERSITY AND THOSE INVESTMENT SHOULD COME WITH CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY GOALS AND METRICS AND EVALUATING EFFICACY. RESOURCES ALONE ARE UNLIKELY TO YIELD THE DESIRED OUTCOMES AND WE MUST SCALE WHAT WE KNOW WORKS. WITHOUT QUESTION CALIFORNIA'S PRESENT AND FUTURE WELL BEING DEPEND ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR DIVERSE STUDENT BODY. CHEATS IMPROVING STUDENT SUCCESS IS ENSURING CENTERS OF POWER AND LEADERSHIP I CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES REFLECT THE NEEDS EXPERIENCES AND STRENGTH OF THE CURRENT AND FUTURE STUDENT BODY. SO THAT THEY CHAMPION POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT STUDENTS. THAT WORK STARTS A THRACIAN ENGENDER DIVERSE LEADERS AND FACULTY AND THAT WORK IS -- CHEN AN OVERDUE. THANK YOU AND I ALSO HAVE WITH ME TODAY OUR SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST WHO CAN HELP ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE REPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU -- QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE -- I I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. SO I I HEARD AND YOU SHARE THE DATA. AND RESEARCH SUPPORTS THE IDEA THAT A DIVERSE FACULTY -- IS -- GOOD. AND POSITIVE FOR AT ACHIEVEMENT ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND ALSO FOR CAMPUS CLIMATE. IN IN YOUR OPINION. UP DO YOU WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE UC SYSTEM SHARES. IN THOSE BELIEFS TODAY. IN YOUR OPINION DO YOU DO YOU FEEL OR THINK THAT YOU SEE SHARES THAT [inaudible] IDEA CONCEPT. WOULD YOU LIKE. I THINK. I THINK THE LEADERSHIP AND THE REGION'S -- AND MANY OF OTHERS INCLUDING FOR INSTANCE -- MY COLLEAGUES IN THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE FOR THE UC SYSTEM PRESIDENT APOLLO TANO. AND SOMEBODY OTHER HAVE PROBABLY HAVE BEEN THE MOST SUDDENLY AROUND THE ISSUE OF FACULTY DIVERSITY -- I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY BELIEVE ARM AND IN FACT -- IT CUTTING EDGE AROUND SOME MEASURES LIKE MICHAEL A QUESTION OF RACIAL CONSCIOUSNESS IMPLICIT BIAS SIX CETERA. AND SO I ACTUALLY WHEN I DID MY LEGAL OPINION I LOOKED AT THE UC'S OF LEGAL OPINION. ON THE MATTER TO SEE WHAT I COULD WE A DRAW FROM THAT FOR OUR OLD SYSTEM OF FOR THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES. I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS QUITE FRANKLY IS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ISSUES OF RACE THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF NEED FOR RACIAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF UNDERSTANDING AROUND IMPLICIT BIAS. AND BIAS COMES OUT IN WAYS THAT WE COULD NEVER IMAGINE AND EVEN THE MOST OF PROGRESSIVE MINDED PEOPLE HAVE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF BIAS AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL IS TO TRAINING AROUND IMPLICIT BIAS WHICH THE USE OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES DOING. I UNDERSTAND THE UC SYSTEM IS ALSO IN THAT ARENA TO ALL BUT FOR ALL THOSE REASONS THOSE BIAS COMES OUT IN MAY BE GUYS WITHIN THE CONCEPT OF WEIGHT PROP TWO OH NINE DOESN'T ALLOW US TO DO THAT OR WAIT DIVERSITY HOW DOES RACIAL DIVERSITY COME INTO PLAY IN. THAT COULD BE SEEN AS PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT EXCITER. SO HOW THAT COMES OUT IN THIS IS EXPRESSLY THE CASE OUT OF COMMITTEE LEVEL WHEN PEOPLE ARE SELECTING AT EIGHT MORE LOCALIZED LEVEL THE JUST THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CAMPUS OR THE SYSTEM. SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL FOR ALL THIS MESSAGING TO REALLY COME DOWN AND BE A COMPLETELY CHAMPION BY PEOPLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. YEAH I MEAN I I THINK I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WE APPRECIATE AND ARM. THE INCREASED ATTENTION AND FOCUS ON THE BENEFITS OF TO STUDENT LEARNING RETENTION AND SUCCESS OF OF FACULTY DIVERSITY AND WE HOPE THAT OUR SYSTEM LEVEL PARTNERS IN THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS -- BUT UNTIL WE SEE INVESTMENTS AND DIVERSIFICATION THE VARYING BODIES -- THAT NEED TO MEET OF THE STUDENTS WE SPOTLIGHTING THE ISSUE ALONE AND WE ALSO WE NEED -- TO TEXT REMAIN COMMITTED. IT YEAH MISTER CHAIR. IF I MAY ADD THE EFFORT THAT YOU'RE DOING IN ENSURING THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE E. L. FUNDING AND JUST LARGELY THE ISSUE IS REALLY CRITICAL ONE OF THE TWELVE STUDIES THAT SHOWN TO HOW IT LIMITED IMPLICIT BIAS. IS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY AND IT'S A CHICAGO STUDY OF POLICE OFFICERS WHEN YOU TELL THEM THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR RACIAL BIAS THE BIAS GOES AWAY. AND WHAT WAS CRITICAL IS FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO KEEP THIS TOPIC. OF VERY FRONT AND CENTER BECAUSE BY DOING THAT AND MONITORING AT THE SYSTEM WILL RESPOND. AND SO I I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO COMMUTING YOU THAT MONITORING LEVEL [inaudible] THANK YOU -- SRC WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE MAKE UP OF THE IS -- THE FACULTY SENATE. COULD YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IF IF THE FACULTY IS -- THIS COMPOSITION. YOU YOU YOU MAKE REFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT THE FACULTY SENATE IS EVEN LESS DIVERSE. THAN THE FACULTY AND GENERAL WHITE WHY IS THAT THE CASE. WELL I THINK YOU KNOW THE ACADEMIC SENATE IS A VOLUNTARY FOR AT THAT TIME FACULTY NITA ELECTED TO SERVE ON AND I THINK A LOT OF TIMES IN THE IN THE RESEARCH WE'VE DONE IN CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH ACADEMIC SAID A LOT OF TIMES. THEY'RE NOT BEING OUT REACHED TWO ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SERVING ON THE ACADEMIC SENATE NECESSARILY OR THEY DON'T I'M. THERE OFTEN TIED UP KIND OF DOING A LOT EFFORTS SO OR TRYING TO HELP OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR IN OTHER OF VARIOUS WAYS AND FEEL LIKE THEY DON'T HAVE THE THE TIME COMMITMENT TO SERVE ON THE ACADEMIC SENATE AND SO I THINK MORE RESEARCH ARE MARKED. OUT REACHES NEEDED -- TO OUR FACULTY TO ENSURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND -- THESE POSITIONS ARE OPEN TO THEM AND THAT THEY SHOULD THAT THEIR COURAGE. TO SERVE ON THOSE BODIES SO FOR EXAMPLE. IN YOU SEE NOT ALL TENURED FACULTY BELONG TO THE ACADEMICS AND I'M A YOU KNOW IT VARIES ACROSS -- THE SYSTEM CAMPUS IN TERM OF WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR I'M SERVING ON ACADEMICS AND IT'S BUT WHAT WE CAN HEAR MORE YEAH WE CAN HEAR MORE FROM THE ACADEMIC SAID IT BUT IT DID. I'M WE ACTUALLY HAVE A WHOLE -- ANALYSIS IN OUR REPORT THAT KIND OF OUTLINES THE DIFFERENT -- RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE'S BY SYSTEM IN CAMPUS BECAUSE IT DOES. VERY FOR N. -- IF YOU WOULD LITERACY CAN YOU SAY MORE ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT. THE DIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT -- THAT THIS STUDY YOUR STUDY I SURE DID BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FACULTY BUT WE'RE ALSO INTERESTED. IN -- ADMINISTRATORS AS WELL AS I MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS ARE REPORT WAS UNIQUE IN THAT IT ANALYZE CAMPUS DIVERSITY BEYOND JUST FACULTY IT LOOKED AT SENIOR LEADERSHIP ON CAMPUS AS WELL AS SYSTEM LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNING BOARD DIVERSITY -- SO THE REPORT FINDS THAT THERE DIVERSITY CHALLENGES AT THOSE LEVELS FOR THE UC -- TO FOR SENIOR LEADERSHIP AT UC CAMPUSES WHICH IS -- FOR INSTANCE CHANCELLOR'S VICE CHANCELLORS AND MEMBERS OF THE CHANCELLOR'S CABINET I'M 70% ARE WHITE AND NEARLY TWO OUT OF FIVE YOU SEE STUDENTS ARE ON P. YET FEWER THAN. ONE IN TEN CAMPUS LEADERS ARE ON WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE UC BOARD OF REGENTS THE APPOINTMENT SO I'M AT THE APPOINTED MEMBERS OF THE UC BOARD OF REGENTS. AND WE FIND THAT THERE SIXTY PURCHASE 62% ARE WHITE 23% LOT NEXT 8% AFRICAN AMERICAN AND 8% ON P.. A AND WE'RE GONNA ADD SOMETHING I THINK. WE WANTED -- YES -- I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP IN OUT ON THE QUESTION OF WHY OF FACULTY OF COLOR NOT PARTICIPATING IN ACADEMIC SENATE LEASE FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THERE'S A STUDY THAT ONE DISSERTATION OF THE YEAR NATIONALLY THAT LOOKED AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN ORANGE COUNTY IN LA. AND THE RESEARCH FOUND THAT FACULTY OF COLOR EVEN AFTER BEING HIRED OFTEN FEEL ISOLATED ON CAMPUS. AND AS A RESULT -- SIMPLY DO A GREAT JOB TEACHING BUT DO NOT ENGAGE IN THE COLLEGE GOVERNANCE ARE INCLUDING ACADEMIC SENATE. AND SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL AS WE LOOK ABOUT OUTREACH IN RECRUITING DIVERSE FACULTY APPLICANTS OF AND AND THEN SELECTING THEM BUT ALSO EVEN POST HIRING. ENSURING THE RIGHT ONBOARDING AND CONTINUAL SUPPORT A FACULTY OF COLOR SO THAT THEY CAN FEEL ENGAGE AND NOT BE RACIALLY ISOLATED ON CAMPUS -- SO IF THEY'RE NOT EVEN PARTICIPATING AT THE LOCAL ACADEMICS AND IT BECOMES EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE AT THE STATEWIDE ACADEMIC SENATE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SURE BLOOM [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. WILL GO AHEAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND WE'LL GO AHEAD GO TO OUR SECOND PANEL. SO -- THEIR SECOND PANEL WILL FOCUS ON SYSTEM WIDE EFFORTS. TO IMPROVING FACULTY DIVERSITY. I AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN HEARING AN UPDATE REGARDING HOW THE UC HAS USE THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE. A AN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE MORE DIVERSITY OF FACULTY. I'D LIKE TO WELCOME. PROVOST AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT. IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT MICHAEL BROWN. AND VICE PROVOST FOR ACADEMIC PERSONNEL AND PROGRAMS ALSO FROM THE UC OFFICES OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT SUSAN CARLSON. WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU JAY AND IS THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE PRESIDENT OF FOOT HILL -- COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THE SENIOR ADVISER POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CAMPAIGN OF COLLEGE ACT OPPORTUNITY. I THANK YOU FOR INVITING US HERE TO DISCUSS WHAT I THINK IT IS IT'S TRULY A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND THAT'S FACULTY DIVERSITY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND I AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH THE PRESIDENT THAT I I WOULD HOPE. THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD KEEP THIS THIS MATTER BEFORE BEFORE. I DO THINK WE HAVE A A GENERATIONAL OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO BEND THE CURVE. HERE AND ACCELERATE -- OF OUR OUR OUR EFFORTS AND OUR OUTCOMES WITH RESPECT. TO FACULTY DIVERSITY AND I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE TO ADD THAT AT THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE. OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HERE -- ARE ROBERT MAY AND CAN COME BACK. NINETY SINCE AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR ACADEMIC AFFAIRS AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY. THAT MY HIGHEST PRIORITIES ARE THREE ONE IS TO ENHANCE THE ACADEMIC QUALITY OF THE UNIVERSITY Y. OUT BECAUSE THAT QUALITY IS WHAT MAKES ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY TO DO UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA MATTER. ARE OUT TO TO DIVERSIFY THE PREVENT SORTED. OUT WITH RESPECT TO WOMEN AND RACIAL ETHNIC MINORITIES. WHY NOT BECAUSE THIS BOTH ADVANCES ACADEMIC QUALITY AND INNOVATION AND IT IS KEY TO MAKING MORRELL? R. THE UNIVERSITY'S ROLE AS ONE OF CALIFORNIANS INSTRUMENTS OF HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY. NUMBER THREE TO ENHANCE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE UNDER REPRESENTED OUR STUDENTS TO EARN A UC QUALITY DEGREE. WHY BECAUSE THIS IS A MARKHAM OF MOST OBVIOUS ENEFIT -- TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. WHY IS FACULTY DIVERSITY ONE OF MY HIGHEST PRIORITIES AS PROVOST ARE -- ALLAH AND OUR IT'S BECAUSE IT IS INEXTRICABLY LINKED IN MY MIND TO THE FIRST PRIORITY -- BECAUSE ALL STUDENTS ARE BETTER EDUCATED AND PREPARED TO LEAD CALIFORNIA OUR NATION AND THE WORLD -- WHEN THEY THERE ARE DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES IN THE CLASSROOM? ODD ARE THESE DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES COME ARE FROM A DIVERSE FACULTY WHO BRING A WIDE RANGE OF INTERESTS ABILITIES LIFE EXPERIENCES WORLD VIEWS -- ARE THAT ENHANCE UC'S TEACHING OUR RESEARCH AND PUBLIC SERVICE MISSIONS. OUT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WE WILL ALSO PRODUCE MORE INNOVATIVE AND SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH WHEN WE HAVE DIVERSE TEAMS COLLABORATING ON THE WORK THAT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S THE RESEARCH INVERSE. AND SO IT AT ARCTIC HERE ARE ARE OUT CITY IS PART OF THE RICHNESS OF THE ROYAL JELLY. ARE OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT WE SEEK TO PROVIDE OUR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS THIS ROYAL JELLY WILL MAKE QUEEN BEES OF ANY STOOD. ARE AND I AM A AND AND I BELIEVE THAT. ARE I STATED. I I STATED TO THE BOARD OF REGENTS AT THEIR MEETING IN SEPTEMBER AND I WILLCLEARLY STATE TO YOU NOW THREE THINGS -- WE HAVE MADE RECENT PROGRESS IN FACULTY DIVERSITY AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WE ARE NOT SATISFIED. WITH THAT PROGRESS A PROGRESS HAS BEEN SMALL AND SLOW. ARE AND WE ARE FULLY AWARE THAT WE NEED TO DO MUCH MORE AND WE FULLY INTEND AND HAVE COMMITTED TO DO MUCH MORE. AND I WANT TO SE NUMBER THREE YOU HAVE HELPED. OUR WITH CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WE HAVE A ONCE IN A GENERATION OPPORTUNITY -- TO REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE. THIS REQUIRES COLLECTIVE VISION OF FOR FAIRNESS AND INCLUSION EXCELLENCE AND BELONGING. AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IS PLAYING AND CAN CONTINUE TO PLAY. ARE AN IMPORTANT LEADERSHIP AND COORDINATING ROLE WITH RESPECT TO THIS COLLECTIVE VISION. I WITH APPRECIATION AND REYES CONTINUE. YOUR PARTNERSHIP WITH US TO FURTHER -- THIS MORE INCLUSIVE VISION I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE STATE FOR ALLOCATING TWO MILLION IN WHAT AND ONE TIME FUNNY BUT IT'S BEEN FOR EACH YEAR. SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE TO SUPPORT EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY PRACTICES THAT YOU SEE. AN AD AND AS YOU LISTEN TO OUR PRESENTATION TODAY. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL SEE OUR OUR WORK TO DIVERSIFY TO PROFESSORIAL. OUT LEVERAGES AND EXTENDS AT THE STATE'S DIRECT INVESTMENT IN THAT EFFORT. ALTHOUGH OUR VICE PROVOST SUSAN CARLSON WILL GO INTO SPECIFIC DETAIL -- LATER ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF THE ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT -- THAT THE AND THE RESULTS ARE IMPRESSIVE OUR OB PARTICULARLY WITH WHAT WE CALL THE ADVANCING FACULTY DIVERSITY PROGRAM -- IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT. ARE ODD THAT CONCENTRATED FUNDING AND PROMISING PRACTICES. ARE HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON IMPROVING DIVERSITY IN HIGH. ARM OUT SO WHAT HAS YOU SIMPLY HEARING HELD AT SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY IN OCTOBER. TWENTY SIXTEEN IN OCTOBER 20157% OF UC'S ARE LOTTERING FACULTY WERE UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES AND 32% WERE WOMEN. TODAY ARE 7% OF UC'S LETTERING FACULTY ARE UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES AND NEARLY 34% ARE WOMEN. THIS IS FOR ANYBODY WHO WORKS IN THIS AREA IT LOOKS SMALL -- BUT THIS IS REAL PROGRESS DAHLE FLOW. ARE IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BEEN GROWING THE FACULTY UNTIL LATE UNTIL -- OUT. MORE AGGRESSIVELY UNTIL RECENTLY AND NOW WE HAVE LIKE I KEEP SAYING AND I WILL KEEP SAY WE HAVE A GENERATIONAL OPPORTUNITY -- TO MAKE STRONG IMPACT ON FACULTY DIVERSITY GIVE IT. AT THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS INCREASED STUDENT ROMAN WELL PAST OUR TARGETS AND THE PENDING RETIREMENT OF OUR AGING FACULTY MEMBERS. BOTH OF THOSE CREATE A NEED TO GROW THE PROFESSORIAL. AND AND THEREFORE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DIVERSIFY -- AT RECENT HIRES OF LORRAINE FACULTY ARE MORE DIVERSE -- AD THEN INCUMBENT FACULTY AND THIS IS -- THAT THAT TO TALK ABOUT IN THE LAST YEAR 17% OF NEW LADDER RANK HIGHER AS WELL UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES AND 44% MORE WOMEN. OUT WITH NEW INVESTMENTS BY THE STATE I COMMIT TO YOU ARE THAT WE WILL BE IN THE CURVE TOGETHER -- THERE WILL BE MORE RAPID PROGRESS. THESE RECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN HIRING AND RETENTION OF DIVERSE FACULTY ARE RESULT OF INTENTIONAL AGGRESSIVE AND MULTI FACETED EFFORTS. UNDERTAKEN AT BOTH THE SYSTEM WIDE IN THE CAMPUS LEVELS. SO WHAT WORKS AND WHY ARE IN ADDITION TO THE ADVANCING FACULTY DIVERSITY PROGRAM THAT MY COLLEAGUE -- VICE PROVOST CARSON TO DISCUSS NEXT I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH BRIEF HIGHLIGHTS OF SOME OF OUR CURRENT -- A SYSTEM WIDE FACULTY DIVERSITY EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN INCREASING FACULTY DIVERSITY WITHOUT THEM WE BELIEVE ARE YOU SEE WOULD LOSE GROUND. SO THEY MUST BE SUSTAINED IF NOT EXPAND. OUR FIRST YOU SEE IS COMMITTED TO HIRING FROM WITHIN AND GROWING ITS OWN LINE -- TO TO THE FACULTY THROUGH RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND FACULTY MENTORING. ONE WAY THAT WE DO THIS IS THROUGH THE PRESIDENT'S POST DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM. BY THE WAY THE CAMPUS IS LOVE THAT PROGRAM AND WE HAVE STRAIGHTENED. BY OUR OWN REDIRECTION RESOURCES STRENGTHENED THAT PROGRAM. ARE OF FOR OVER THREE AND A HALF DECADES THIS YOUNG FACULTY TO YOU SEE OUR OUR FACULTY WITH A CLEAR DEDICATION TO ISSUES OF EQUITY AND DIVERSITY IN THE RESEARCH TEACHING. AND OUTREACH OUR CAMPUSES LOVE THIS PROGRAM SECONDLY YOU SEE RECRUIT. YOU SEE HAVE AN ONLINE ONE STOP. SHOP FACULTY RECRUITMENT SYSTEM. WHICH ALLOWS EVERY SINGLE CAMPUS AT TO LEVERAGE BEST PRACTICES IN EQUAL EMPLOYMENT STREAMLINED THE PROCESS. AND SUPPORT APPLICANTS IN ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS HOLISTICALLY. ARE CRITICALLY IN IN AND AND PROVIDE DATA FOR EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF OUR OF OUR PROGRAM WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WE CANNOT FOOL OURSELVES BY IGNORING THE ROLE THAT SALARIES PLAY IN RECRUITING AND RETAINING A DIVERSE FACULTY IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT ALL FACULTY BUT IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO. THEY'RE SO RARE IN THIS IN THIS FEAR THEY HAVE OPTIONS IN MANY OTHER PLACES. ARE SOLD SO NEXT WEEK ON OCTOBER THIRTY ONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ACADEMIC SENATE -- NO WE JUST DID THIS -- NO NO NO IS COMING NEXT WEEK -- I'M HOLDING A SIMPLE THAT WE WE HAD ANOTHER SUPPOSE WE HAD RETREAT -- RECENTLY WITH OUR EBC SEES WITH THEIR ACADEMIC DEANS WERE THERE ON ADVANCING FACULTY DIVERSITY BUT BUTTON BUT NEXT WEEK WE HAVE A SYMPOSIUM A WITH LEADERS FROM THE SENATE AND ADMINISTRATION. TO DISCUSS THE MULTI YEAR ANALYSIS OF FACULTY SALARIES CONDUCTED BY THE CAMPUS IS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND RECTIFY ANY INEQUITIES THAT ARE BASED ON GENDER OR RACIAL ETHNICITY. MY OFFICE HAS BEEN PROVIDING THE ARE THE PRESIDENT WITH ALL THE INFORMATION AND DATA -- WE CAN IN ORDER TO MAKE FACULTY SALARIES COMPETITIVE ANY LIMIT SITUATIONS OF OF AND A COURT IN EQUITY. NECKS LEADERSHIP DOESN'T MATTER -- THE CAMPUS AND SYSTEMWIDE LEADERSHIP -- DEMONSTRATE OUR AND ARE ARE CONTINUING TO DEMONSTRATE COMMITMENT TO DIVERSIFY BY HAVING POLICIES THAT RECOGNIZE AND REWARD FACULTY CONTRIBUTIONS. TO DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. BECAUSE LEADERSHIP MATTERS WE REINFORCE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LEADERSHIP WE BELIEVE IN ACCOUNTABILITY AND BY THE WAY THAT WAS THAT TOPIC -- AT AT THE RETREAT THAT WE HAD -- OUR LAST WEEK -- JUST LAST WEEK ON RIGHT OCTOBER SIXTEENTH PROVOST HEX EXPERT FROM UC DAVIS AND I CONVENE THE ACADEMIC LEADERSHIP FROM THE CAMPUS IS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED TO YOU. TO FOR ADD TO FOCUS ON BOTH ACCOUNTABILITY I HAVE FOR ADVANCING OUT OF THE FACULTY DIVERSITY PROGRAM WE INTENTIONALLY INVITED THOSE -- THOSE LEADERS THAT I DESCRIBED A BECAUSE THEY ARE KEY TO THE EFFORTS TO REACH THE DEPARTMENTS ON THE GROUND WHERE THE FACULTY HAVE THEIR HOMES. ARE I AND AND I THINK WE ALL FOUND THE VICTORY QUITE HARDENING OUR PRESIDENT IN THE PART OF TOWN ARE REPORTED AT THE SEPTEMBER BOARD. OF THE REGIONS THAT SHE MEETS ANNUALLY WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S. AS PART OF CAMPUS REVIEWS TO ADDRESS -- STUDENT FACULTY IN DIVERSITY AND SHE SENT A FOLLOW UP LETTER THAT INDICATES ARE -- THE DIGEST OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND EXPECTATIONS ARE FOR FOR FOR OUR FUTURE ACTION SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE. OUT WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS TO TAKE US TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF PROGRESS. YOU WILL HEAR ARE FROM RIVERSIDE DAVIS IRVINE CAMPUSES IN THE NEXT PANEL -- WITH EXAMPLES OF MANY PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES ARE AT THE CAMPUSES THAT ARE TARGETED AT BUILDING. A STRONG AND DIVERSE OUR PROFESSORIAL BUT YOU SEE I WILL JUST BRIEFLY MENTIONED THAT UC SAN DIEGO IS HOSTING THE UC CHECK CONNECTS LATIN MIX -- LEADERSHIP SUMMIT IN LATE NOVEMBER I'LL BE THERE. OUR AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM MY CHECK CONNECTS AND LET NEXT COLLEAGUES I AM PLEASED THAT ARE AMONG THE STATE IS THAT CHAIR MEDINA YOU'LL BE JOINING US. AS WELL. ARE I AM DEEPLY COMMITTED TO SCAFFOLDING A MORE. FOR THE UNIVERSITY. I THINK THIS IS A NECESSARY PART OF MAKING THE UNIVERSITY FUTURE READY AND AND I HAVE WITH THE DISCUSSIONS I HAD WITH JANET AT THE TIME OF Y. HIRING. I WAS VERY CLEAR THAT IF SHE WASN'T INTERESTED IN THIS BEEN ADDED NEED DESKTOP AYE AYE TO ADD IN THE MORNING. ARE SHE ENDED UP HIRING ME I I TOOK THAT TO BE SHE WAS COMMITTED TO THIS AND I HOPE MY ACTIONS AT THAT TIME HAVE INDICATED THAT. HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW. NO SINGLE APPROACH WILL RESULT IN MORE DIVERSE FACULTY YOU SEE IS NOW TAKING ACTIVE STEPS TO IS STRIPPED THEM AND EXPAND OUR SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS. PRESIDENT APOLLO -- TEN ANNOUNCED ON SEPTEMBER TWENTY SIX ARE THAT SHE IS DEDICATING AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION ANNUALLY. TO EXPAND SUCCESSFUL INSTRUCTIONAL TRAINING. AND TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT CREATE PATHWAYS TO THE PROFESSORIAL FOR DIVERSE GRADUATE STUDENTS AND POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS ARE AND CREATE NEW PROGRAMS TO ENSURE. THAT YOU SEE STUDENTS BENEFIT. FROM A MORE YOU ARE INVESTMENT THAT HEY HERE TO TO HAVE BEEN ONE TIME BUT IT'S BEEN IT BUT IT'S BEEN MADE ONGOING I'M I'M JUST I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW EXCITED I AM ABOUT THAT. A DIVERSE AND EXCELLENT FACULTY IS ESSENTIAL TO THE EDUCATION OF YOU SEE STUDENTS AND BETTER EFFECTING THAT DIVERSITY REQUIRES ROBUST INTERVENTION. ARE AND PATHWAYS INTO THE PROFESSOR. THIS THAT PATHWAYS ORIENTED APPROACH ARE RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF MULTIPLE IN INTERVENTION SUSTAINED OVER TIME. ARE TO IDENTIFY AND CULTIVATE TALENT. AND FOR OFFERING INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM SERVICES INCENTIVES THAT REFLECT THE WAYS THAT SCHOLARS OF COLOR AND WOMEN EXPERIENCE THEIR CAREERS WERE ALSO GOING TO GROW THE VERY SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT'S POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM I SPOKE OF EARLIER. TO BRING MOST MORE POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS TO OUR CAMPUSES FOR CERTAIN FEELS PARTICULARLY IN STEM POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS MATTER -- IN TERMS OF GIVING THEM A LEG UP -- ALL ALONG THEIR THEIR ACADEMIC CAREERS -- IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO LEAVE A QUOTE ANY THOUGHT -- BASED UPON IT WITH YOU. ENCLOSING HIS SPEECHES BOBBY KENNEDY. I USED TO SAY. THAT SOME SEE THINGS AS THEY ARE DREAMS NEVER WORK. AND ASK WHY NOT -- WE HAVE NEVER HAD. THE MOST INCLUSIVE OF FACULTY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I AM NOT INTERESTED. IN THE WHY IS THAT. AYE AM INTERESTED AND WHY. WE EN I AND I'M DEDICATED TO TRYING TO MAKE THAT REALITY HAPPEN SO ON THE AYE AYE YIELD -- TO SUSAN CARS -- CHAIR MEDINA -- LET ME ADD MY THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT OUR HIGH PRIORITY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BUILDING A TALENTED. INNOVATIVE AND DIVERSE FACULTY. OUR ADVANCING FACT THE DIVERSITY PROGRAM -- WHICH YOU'VE SUPPORTED THROUGH THREE YEARS OF ONE TIME ALLOCATIONS OF TWO MILLION DOLLARS HAS LED TO AN UNPARALLELED FLOURISHING OF INITIATIVES THAT ARE ALLOWING US TO EXPERIMENT. IN NOVEL WAYS. THE ANNUAL NATURE OF THE FUNDING HAS MET WE'VE HAD AGGRESSIVE TIME LINES WE CONTINUED WITH OTHER EFFORTS IN PROGRAMS ALREADY UNDER WAY OF COURSE BUT YOU'VE CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TEST AND REPLICATE NEW INTERVENTIONS THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THE LEGISLATURE'S CLEAR ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE HAS BOOSTED MORALE AND MADE A POWERFUL DIFFERENCE IN OUR WORK. FOR YOU SEE IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT THE PROGRAM'S BEEN BASED ON THE VALUES WE HAVE IS A RESEARCH INSTITUTION AND MY COLLEAGUE HAS JUST REFERRED TO THAT AS WELL. VALUES OF COMPETITION EVALUATION AND METRICS AND ACCOUNTABILITY. SO I'D LIKE TO START BY FOCUSING ON THE RESULTS FROM THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THIS FUNDING. THEN LOOK AT THE CURRENT YEAR IN CURRENT AT WORK IN YEAR. THREE IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THIS PROGRAM WE SAW SOME EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESSES AFTER COMPETITIVELY AWARDING FUNDING FOR SEVEN PILOT PROGRAMS. IN YOUR TO ALONE FOR OF THESE PILOTS AVERAGED 31% INCREASE IN UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY FACULTY HIRED. YOUR ONE INCLUDED PILOTS IN THE BOARD'S COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AT UC RIVERSIDE THE JACOBS SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AT UC SAN DIEGO. AND THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES AT UC DAVIS. IN YOUR TO WE HAD PILOTS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS AT UC SANTA BARBARA. THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AT UC BERKELEY. BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES IS AT YOU SEE GO AND SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING AT UC IRVINE. BUT ALL TEN CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED EITHER AS PILOT UNITS OR COMPARATOR UNITS. DURING PANEL THREE YOU'LL HEAR IMPRESSIVE RESULTS FROM COLLEAGUES AT THREE OF OUR CAMPUSES WHO HAVE HAD SOME OF THIS FUNDING. UC RIVERSIDE IN YEAR ONE TESTED THE USE THE EARLIEST OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSITY STATEMENTS. AND THE AWARD OF A RESEARCH YEAR TO INCOMING FACULTY. UC IRVINE FOCUSED ON RECRUITMENT OF DIVERSE POSTDOCS IN THE PRESIDENT'S POST DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM WITH HIGH SUCCESS. AND UC DAVIS HAS HAD FUNDING IN BOTH YOURS ONE AND THREE EXPERIMENTING WITH A NEW CAMPUS WIDE INCENTIVE IN THIS CURRENT YEAR. AND I HAVE A FEW OTHER DETAILS OF CAMPUSES WHO ARE NOT HERE TO SPEAK TO ABOUT THEIR WORK. IN YOUR ONE FOR EXAMPLE UC SAN DIEGO IN ENGINEERING THEY HIRED MINORITY FACULTY AND 1338% WOMEN FACULTY BOTH ALL TIME HIGHS. IN YOUR TO AS I SAID EARLIER THERE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY AND FEMALE FACULTY IN ALL FOUR OF THE PILOT UNITS. AS I SAID FOR THESE FOUR UNITS AVERAGE OF 31% INCREASE IN UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY FACULTY HIRED. BUT ALSO A 12% INCREASE IN FEMALE FACULTY HIRED OVER THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS. THESE RATES WERE NOTABLY HIGHER THAN THOSE IN THE COMPARED TO UNITS WHO DID NOT RECEIVE THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER CRUCIAL OF DETAIL TO THIS ESPECIALLY IN YOUR TO A FOR FUNDING THE STATE FUNDING HAS TRULY LEVERAGED ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL IN ALL THREE YEARS WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT CAMPUS INVESTMENT IN THESE PROGRAMS. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NOT REQUIRED. THE STRUCTURE OF THIS PROGRAM HAS CREATED A SENSE OF URGENCY THROUGH ITS MANDATE THAT EFFORTS TAKE PLACE IN A SINGLE ACADEMIC RECRUITMENT CYCLE AND PRESS TO RECRUITMENT ALMOST ALL START IN THE FALL AND CONCLUDE BY JULY WHEN OUR NEW FACULTY. JOIN US -- SO IT WAS A PUSH TO TO TO TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN HIRING IN THE COURSE OF THAT SINGLE YEAR BUT THIS PROGRAM HAS BROUGHT POWERFUL NEW ACCOUNTABILITY pADVISORY GROUP THAT TRACKS PROGRESS OF THE PILOT PROGRAMS ON A MONTHLY BASIS. BOTH OF THESE COMPONENTS ARE A NEW FACTORY IN OUR WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY. WE ALSO HAVE SEEN THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM DEMONSTRATES THE NEED FOR CERTAIN COMMON PRACTICES STRONG LEADERSHIP FROM CHAIRS DEANS AND PROVOSTS. DELIBERATE EFFORTS TO CHANGE EVALUATION PRACTICES AND CAREFULLY PLANNED OUR EACH. AND THEN JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CURRENT YEAR HERE THREE OF THIS FUNDING. WE'VE CONTINUED THE FOCUS ON RECRUITMENT AND THIS YEAR HAVE MADE FOR A NEW PILOT PROGRAM AWARDS. ALL DRAW FROM THE SUCCESSFUL INTERVIEW HERE'S ONE AND TWO ALSO AT THE REQUEST OF CAMPUS LEADERSHIP WE'VE CONDUCTED A SECOND REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS WITH A FOCUS NOT ON RECRUITMENT. BUT ON BUILDING AND TESTING PRACTICES THAT WILL ENSURE WE RETAIN OUR DIVERSE FACULTY AND PROVIDE AN INCLUSIVE ACADEMIC CLIMATE FOR ALL. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH QUALITY OF THE PROPOSAL'S PRESIDENT OF POLITECNICO OF FUNDS SIX OF THESE RETENTION PROJECTS. WE WOULD NOT BE AT THIS POINT WITHOUT THE STATE FUNDING AND YOUR INSISTENCE ON ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH MEANS SUCH AS THIS. HERE FEW DETAILS OF WHAT'S NEW AND EXCITING IN YEAR. THREE THE LIFE SCIENCES AT UC BERKELEY ARE REFINING RECRUITMENT PRACTICES THAT WERE IMMENSELY SUCCESSFUL IN BERKELEY ENGINEERING DURING YOUR TO R. SAID IS FULLY INTEGRATING THE STUDENTS NEEDS AS THEY PLAN THEIR PILOT. AND WHAT'S NEW FACTLY ON OUR ON CAMPUS NEXT FALL DAY WILL BE MATCHED WITH EXPERT TEACHING MENTORS. THE DISCIPLINE OF MATHEMATICS HAS SOME OF THE LOWEST REPRESENTATION OF UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES AND FEMALE FACULTY. UC RIVERSIDE HAS DESIGNED A BOLD PILOT TO PIONEER NEW PRACTICES IN MATH. AND TO ENSURE WE RETAIN THE DIVERSE FACULTY OF IT THAT WE ALREADY HAVE WE'RE FOCUSING ON PROGRAMS IN THE ARTS HUMANITIES AND OTHER DISCIPLINES WITH THE HIGHEST CURRENT REPRESENTATION OF UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES. WE'RE ALSO TESTING SOME SUCCESSFUL WAYS TO UNDERSTAND AND IMPROVE CLIMATE ISSUES AT THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL. AND FINALLY SEVERAL THIS YEAR'S PILOTS ARE ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF SERVICE WORK AND IT'S DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TIME OR MONEY TO WASTE E NEED TO MOVE NOW TO INCREASE OUR CAPACITY TO TEST MORE INTERVENTIONS AND TO DEVELOP AND ANALYZE DATA THAT TELLS US WHERE THE PILOT INTERVENTIONS ARE WORKING. AND FRANKLY WHERE THEY'RE NOT. YOU SEE HAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED DEAN LED ACADEMIC UNITS AND WE HAVE DIRECTLY TOUCHED ONLY A FEW IT WITH THESE THREE YEARS OF FUNDING WE WOULD LIKE TO COMMIT. I WOULD LIKE TO BUILD COMMITMENTS TO FACULTY DIVERSITY IN ALL OF OUR UNITS SO THAT WE CAN TRULY TALK ABOUT INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATION. FACULTY INVOLVED TO DATE HAVE BEEN MOST RESPONSIVE AND THEY APPRECIATE THE EVIDENCE BASED TOOLS AND PRACTICES WE'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BUILD THESE PARTNERSHIPS. WOULD ALSO LIKE TO CONTINUE MAKING MORE SUSTAIN PROGRESS AND DISCIPLINES WHERE WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES ARE STILL IN SMALL NUMBERS. SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS ECONOMICS MANAGEMENT. AND OTHERS. BUT WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF THOSE FACULTY IN DISCIPLINES WHOSE RESEARCH AND TEACHING DEAL WITH ISSUES OF EQUITY IN ACCESS. FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS PEDAGOGY IMMIGRATION CULTURAL STUDIES ECONOMIC DISPARITY DISCRIMINATION RACE ETHNICITY GENDER SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER EXPRESSION. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND OUR COLLECTION. OF SURVEY INFORMATION AS WELL ON WHY ARE FACULTY CHOOSE TO LEAVE YOU SEE. AN WITH THOSE WHO DECIDE TO STAY WHITE WHY THEY DO STEP AT UC AND WERE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN HOW THOSE REASONS MAY DIFFER BY RACE. GENDER AND ETHNICITY. PUBLISHED BROWN IS LET YOU KNOW THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS PUTTING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES INTO THIS WORK. AS WELL AS OTHER ESTABLISHED AND SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS WE HOPE AS WELL THAT THE STATE WILL CONTINUE TO CEDE OUR EFFORTS AS YOU HAVE FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. THIS IS SENT A POWERFUL MESSAGE OF YOUR PRIORITIES TO OUR LEADERS FACULTY AND STUDENTS AND POTENTIAL FACULTY AND STUDENTS THAT WE WANT TO LEAD THE WAY. ON THIS ISSUE IN THIS COUNTRY HEAR FROM US AGAIN SOON WE HAVE TWO REPORTS COMING TO YOU BY DECEMBER FIRST ABOUT THE SECOND YEAR A FINAL REPORT ON SET THE RESULTS IN A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON YOUR THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE THE ADDITION WE HAD ASSEMBLY MEMBER FREDDIE RODRIGUEZ HERE WITH US -- FOR A BIT AND WELCOME -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN MCCARTY HERE TODAY -- THIS AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR JOINING US -- MY REACTION -- IN THE CITY OF RIVERSIDE THAT I REPRESENT BY SOMETIME HAVE THE OCCASION TO VISIT. THE RIVERSIDE GREATER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. AND WHEN I GO THERE TO THE RIVERSIDE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. OF IT'S A ROOM NOT. LIVE IT'S SMALLER THAN THIS BUT THE PAST PRESIDENTS OF THE RIVERSIDE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE PICTURES ARE ON THAT WALL. WHEN I GO VISIT? AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY DIFFERENT PRESIDENTS THE GREATER RIVERSIDE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAVE HAD [inaudible] BUT SAY THERE'S FIFTY THERE ARE FIFTY WHITE MEN. EXCUSE ME FORTY NINE WHITE MEN ON THAT WALL. WHEN I GO VISIT? THIS MORNING. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE AN EIGHT YEAR OLD CONSTITUENT WHO CELEBRATED HIS BIRTHDAY AND HE CHOSE TO CELEBRATE HIS BIRTHDAY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. SO I TOOK HIM TO THE FLOOR OF THE ASSEMBLY. HE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I PROCEEDED TO SHOW HIM. THE PICTURES OF THE SPEAKERS OF THE HOUSE OF THE SPEAKERS OF THE ASSEMBLY GOING BACK. TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY I NOTICED SOMETHING. ABOUT THOSE PICTURES. I NOTICED THAT IF WE GO BACK. TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY IN ALL THERE WERE WHITE MEN ONE WHITE MAN AFTER ANOTHER. TELL WE GET TO MORE -- CURRENT TIMES IN OF NINETEEN SIXTIES NINETEEN SEVENTIES EIGHTIES. THINGS START TO CHANGE. AND WE SEE -- AFRICAN AMERICAN -- SPEAKER THE HOUSE LATINO SPEAKERS OF THE HOUSE. IT IS GONNA BE ALMOST FIFTY YEARS. THAT I GRADUATED FROM UC RIVERSIDE THAT FIGURE THAT YEAR IS APPROACHING RAPIDLY THAT IT WILL BE FIFTY YEARS THAT I GRADUATED FROM UC RIVERSIDE. AND IN THOSE FIFTY YEARS. WHEN I GO TO THE CAMPUSES AND VISIT THE CAMPUSES WHETHER IT'S UCLA? UC RUBBER SAID UC SAN DIEGO UC SANTA BARBARA UC RIVERSIDE. I SEE AS IS INDICATED IN THIS REPORT. THAT THE STUDENT BODY HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. WHEN THEY WERE ALMOST? KNOW THAT THE NO STUDENTS AT UCLA AS EARLY AS THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. RIGHT LATINO STUDENTS ARE BEGINNING TO BE THE MAJORITY. OF THE STUDENT BODY. IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO AS THE STUDENT BODY HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. THE PICTURES ON THE WALL OF THE FACULTY REMAINED VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THE PICTURES AND THAT RAIDER RIVERSIDE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. AND IF YOU SEE [inaudible] VALUES -- WHAT WE SAID OUR IS DIVERSITY FOR THE REASONS THAT WE'VE OUTLINED HERE -- IT'S HARD FOR ME. IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SIT HERE FIFTY YEARS LATER WHEN I WAS A STUDENT -- ENTERING COLLEGE IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND HEAR FROM AS FAR SEE THAT IT WAS HARD FOR HER WHO IS A MUCH YOUNGER PERSON. TO SEE A FACULTY DIVERSITY OF FACULTY WHEN SHE WAS A STUDENT I HAVE IN FRONT OF ME THE FIGURES. GOING BACK. TO NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR A FIGURES FOR YOUR UC FOR BOTH TENURE AND NON TENURED FACULTY. AND AS I LOOK DOWN HERE ICY GOING BACK TO NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AFRICAN AMERICAN. TENURE NON TENURED FACULTY EIGHT UC WAS 2% IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR LATINO CHICANO FACULTY WAS 5%. SO THAT'S NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR I GO ACROSS. ALL THE WAY OVER HERE. FOURTEEN AFRICAN AMERICAN FACULTY IN THE FIGURES THAT I HAVE HERE ACTUALLY WENT DOWN. ACTUALLY WENT DOWN FROM 2% 21% ACROSS UC. LATINO FACULTY IN THAT SAME TIME FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR TO NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WENT UP. FROM 5%. THE 8%. OVER A FORTY YEAR SPAN SO. DOCTOR BROWN WELL YOU SAY WHY NOT [inaudible] I'M REMINDED. OF MARTIN LUTHER KING WHO TALKED ABOUT [inaudible] HAVING PATIENTS. MY PATIENCE IS RUNNING OUT. LIVE PATIENCE IS RUNNING OUT AND AND ALSO YOU KNOW I I I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS. AND THE MONEY THAT THOSE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALLOCATED BUT IF THIS IS YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE DONE. IF THIS IS WHAT WE'VE DONE ALI. SIT SIT HERE AND I'M NOT. VERY OPTIMISTIC. AND AYE AYE AYE AYE PASSED AND I AM. ACTUALLY MENTIONED. GONNA ASK HIM. THE SAME QUESTION THE SPEAKER BETTIS REBEL REGION BETTERS ASKED AT THE LAST REGION'S MEETING. THAT AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING NOW. THE RATE WE'RE GOING NOW. HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE IS TO HAVE THE FACULTY TO REFLECT THE STUDENT BODY? A HUNDRED YEARS. IF WE USE THAT. THAT THAT KIND RATE -- ARE HOW TO AND AND AND I'M I'M MIGHT ACT MIGHT BE OVERLY GENEROUS. SO OUR I I THINK -- ARE WHAT THE I WOULD. SAY TO ONE FOR FIRST OF ALL THE OVERALL PICTURE. I AM NOT DISPUTING [inaudible] AND WOULDN'T. I'M HAPPY FOR THIS KIND HEARING AND I'M HAPPY FOR LEGISLATORS LOOK AT LATERS FOCUS ON THE I DO WANT TO INDICATE THAT PERCENTAGES DON'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY. YOU HAVE TO ALSO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS BECAUSE THE BASE IS DIFFERENT WE HAVE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FACULTY NOW. SO SOUL EVE IS SOLD WOULD BE A PERCENT INCREASES ON A ON A BIGGER BASE SO IT DOES SHOW SOME SOME GROWTH. BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL PICTURE DON'T HERE DON'T HEAR ME ARGUING ABOUT IT I AGREE. OUR INTER THE FUNDAMENTAL PICTURE. NOW I DO THINK WE HAVE. AS I SAID BEFORE I'LL SAY IT AGAIN I THINK WE HAVE A GENERATION OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THIS. THERE'S BEEN PENT UP NEED TO HIRE. FOR WE HAVE PROCESSES WE HAVE POLICIES AND WE ARE PRACTICES IN PLACE THAT WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO HIRE MORE FRANKLY WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY YOU REALLY RAPIDLY DIVERSIFY. THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE HAD A WITH THE STATE WITH RESPECT TO THAT THAT THAT TO ME PERCENT. PER YEAR IF WE CAN JUST STRENGTH OF THAT PARTNERSHIP AND ENABLED US TO HIRE FACULTY AT AT AT OUT GIVEN ALSO THE AGING OF THE FACULTY THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAPIDLY CHANGE THE PICTURE -- IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT -- ARE OUT OF OUR VESSEL OUT WHAT I'D SAY ABOUT THAT SUSAN DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING -- TO I WOULD ALSO SAY WE CAN'T DISPUTE THE NUMBERS THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU AND WERE DISAPPOINTED BY THEM AS WELL. IT DOES FEEL THOUGH WITH THE PARTICULARLY WITH THIS PROGRAM WHERE YOU HAVE PUT YOUR COMMITMENTS ON THE LINE. THAT IT HAS CREATED A NEW SENSE OF URGENCY AND IT'S WE TRULY HAVE A NEW PRACTICES GOING ON IN WAYS -- WE WERE ALL PREPARED FOR BUT THE MONEY MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND THEN WE SAY -- OF WHEN I THINK WASN'T GENERATION OPPORTUNITY LOOK WE'RE LEGISLATORS IT LATER AS ARE AT YOUR HAVING THIS HEARING ON YOU SEE FACULTY DIVERSITY HAS THAT HAPPENED. FOR EUROPE BESIDES THE THE PRESENTATION WOULD IMAGINE THAT IT HAS FOR OKAY BUT PRIOR YOU KNOW THIS IS IN RECENT YEARS. WE'VE GOT REGIONS THAT ARE DEDICATED TO THIS ISSUE. WHICH I WOULD I SERVED IN IN MY BROTHER'S CAPACITY AS CHAIR OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE COMMITMENT FROM THE REGION'S AT THAT TIME -- OUT THIS PRESIDENT HAS GONE BEYOND BEYOND LIP SERVICE TO THE DEDICATION OF OF DIVERSITY. HOW WE HAVE HAD WHICH I DIDN'T SHARE MY LITTLE PRESENTATION WE HAVE HAD CHANCE L'OREAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT FACULTY DIVERSITY WE HAVE HAD AND I I SIT WITH THE EEVEE SEES -- OUT LACHESIS IT WITH BOTH OF THE AT HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR PROGRAMS THE DEDICATION ALONG THESE LINES WE HAVE NOW THIS PATHWAYS FOR WHICH THERE IS. A COMING TOGETHER OF A GREAT DEAL OF FOCUS ON THIS. YEAH I I I WOULDN'T A DISPUTE ARGUES THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT THERE ARE. PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO HELP THE NUMBERS GROW. BUT IN THE AND AND AND AND I THINK THOSE PROGRAMS OR OR OR WITH WHILE. AND WE'RE SUPPORTING. BUT WHEN I SIT DOWN [inaudible] AT AT COCO'S IN THE MORNING. WITH -- AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN AND WE AS OLDER. MEN TALK ABOUT. THE UC AND HIGHER EDUCATION. WE WE SEE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. AND AND I GUESS THAT IT THAT CONTRASTS WITH SO MUCH AND SO STARKLY. WITH OTHER WITH OTHER WITH OTHER SEGMENTS OF EMPLOYMENT OR YOU KNOW YOU IT THEN THE IN THE IN THE FILL. OF PAT BROWN THEY SHOW A LEGISLATURE ITSELF THAT THE LEGISLATOR. IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES AGAIN. IN A PREDOMINATELY WHITE MEN. LOOK AT THE CHANGE THAT HAS COME ABOUT AND SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES TO TODAY YEAH AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT WHY IS IT THAT A HIGHER EDUCATION. LAGS SO MUCH AND I I WOULD LIKE TO ASK AND BRING OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU KNOW I I HEARD. ABOUT THE RECRUIT I HEARD ABOUT APPLYING ONLINE. BUT I ALSO HEARD JUST IN MY COMMUNITY [inaudible] RIVERSIDE [inaudible] TO PHD. ONE AS RECENT AS YESTERDAY AND ANOTHER PHD -- GENTLEMAN BOTH LATINA. WHO I'VE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME -- FIRST ONE IS THE FIRST ONE IS NOW TEACHING AT UC RIVERSIDE. HE SAID THAT HE WAS ONLY HIRED IN HIS FOURTH ATTEMPT. AT UC RIVERSIDE. THAT HE HE TAUGHT [inaudible] AT THE AND WHY YOU. HE TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS. BOTH OF THOSE IN THAT ORDER BEFORE COMING TO UC ARE BUT THAT HE APPLIED FOR TIMES. DO YOU SEE OUR DIDN'T EVEN GET INTERVIEWED. IN IN ONE OF THE ATTEMPTS. IT IS THE SAME THAT I HEAR FROM MY FRIEND. UP WITH ANOTHER PHD. APPLYING TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND CAT GET AN INTERVIEW CANNOT GET INTERVIEWED. THEY'RE NOT EVEN LAST SO. COUPLE OF THINGS THAT THAT THAT COME TO MIND [inaudible] WITHIN UC. THAT I HEAR. THAT WERE IN THAT INTERVIEW PROCESS AND TRYING TO BECOME FACULTY. THE DEPARTMENTS ARE SO NARROW. IN WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING. FOR OR THAT THEY PERPETUATE. THE PRACTICE OF WHAT THEY ARE ARE ALREADY DOING. SO THEY LOOK FOR PHD WHO ARE DOING. IT SEEMS TO ME AND I AM NOT A PHD EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF WORK THAT THEY ARE DOING. USING THE SAME METHODOLOGY THAT THEY ARE USING. AND ARE NOT OPEN. ARE NOT OPEN TO DIFFERENCES. AND I I WOULD SAY THAT BOTH OF THOSE THINGS NEED TO CHANGE OR ELSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE FIFTY YEARS DOWN THE LINE. THE SAME DISCUSSION AS WE ARE HAVING NOW [inaudible] AND AND THAT THAT THAT HAS TO BE FRUSTRATING. TO CANDIDATES. THAT HAS TO BE OF FRESH STATING TO STUDENTS -- BECAUSE WE ARE PRODUCING PH DAYS. BUT IF THEY ARE NOT DOING EXACTLY THAT KIND OF WORK. THAT THE COMMITTEE OR THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING FOR THEY DON'T GET HIRED -- MR MCCARTY. YES THANK YOU -- FIRST OF ALL AT THANKS FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING I KNOW WE HAD A JOINT HEARING. WITH THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND HIGHER AT TWO YEARS AGO ON THE SAME TOPIC SO IT IS. AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND AS MR MEDINA MENTION WE HAVE COULD REMAIN THE BUDGET IN THIS ISSUE FOR THREE YEARS IN A ROW. AND YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T JUST THROW MONEY AROUND AND IS EXPECTED THINGS TO HAPPEN BUT WE WE CERTAINLY WANT. TO ADDRESSES BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE PERCEPTION WHEN STUDENTS GO THE CLASSROOMS AND SEE WHO'S TEACHING THEM YOU KNOW RESEARCH SHOWS US BY WERE TRYING TO GET. OR ETHNIC STUDIES FROM OUR COLLEGES DOWN THERE ARE HIGH SCHOOLS IT REALLY DOES MAKE IT A DIFFERENCE IN IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT SO -- YOU KNOW WE DON'T REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT AND ONE ISSUES THAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT IT I'VE TIME. HAPPENING BECAUSE THERE'S A GENERATION OF PEOPLE GONNA RETIRE. ITSELF THERE'S A WAVE OF THESE BOOMERS BUT EVERYONE A COLUMN. IN THIS COHORT AGAIN RETIRED. AND IF YOU GET IT WRONG YOU LOCK IT IF THERE FORTY YEARS LIKE. IT'S LIKE PUT RED CAP ON THE SUPREME COURT. BAD ANALOGY THERE BUT YES BUT IT'S A IT'S A YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY AT THIRTY FORTY FIFTY YEAR -- TEN YOUR POSITION SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET -- THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE IN THE POSITION THAT REFLECT -- CALIFORNIA SO THERE IS IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY I REALLY WANT TO HEAR. THE NEXT PANEL WE GET TO THAT AS FAR AS WHAT'S HAPPENING. AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL AND WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THOSE RESOURCES WE PUT IN BUT I WANT TO ASK I WANT TO GO UP TO ONE SPECIFIC THING BECAUSE SOME OF THESE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. IS KIND OF THE CHICKEN THAT WHAT COMES FIRST YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF THAT. FOR EXAMPLE AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS WHO ARE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES WHO ARE UCL'S WILL GO ON THE UC IT'S A IT'S A NUMBER THAT'S VERY VERY LONG. EMBARRASSING IS. LESS WAY LESSENED BY PRESENTING IS THREE PER EXAMPLE THAT CO WORKER EVEN THAT TINO -- ACT ECONOMICS PHD IS NOT THAT GREAT SO THEY'RE PROBABLY IN HIGH DEMAND. IT'S LIKE A HIGHLY COVETED. START BUT ALL QUARTERBACK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SORT OF THEIR WHO RECRUITED BY. ALL THESE COLLEGES WHAT HAVE YOU AND THEY CAN THEY CAN PICK SO. I ASSUME THAT WE HAVE THE SAME CHALLENGES WE'RE WE'RE GOING AFTER. INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN CHECK IN AND CHIU SO IF WE DO -- LET'S SAY WIN THE PRIZE AND AND GET SOME SOME GREAT TALENT THAT SOME OF OUR NINE UC'S AN UNDERGRADUATE UC'S. DO WE HAVE A CHALLENGE AND SOMETHING AND KEEPING THEM IT IS THAT'S ISSUE TO IS NOT JUST. RECRUITMENT RETENTION SO. HOW DOES HOW DOES THAT HOW'S THAT PLAYING OUT WOULD WHEN WE HAVE BEEN MAKING A DIFFERENCE AND IN AND FINING PEOPLE TELLING HIS POSITIONS AND? AND KEEPING THEM WITHIN THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA. WE DO HAVE -- A CHALLENGE IN RETENTION BOTH BECAUSE AS YOU SAID -- THE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT HAVE OTHER OPTIONS. AND BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY'RE IN ENVIRONMENTS DON'T FEEL THEY CAN DO THEIR BEST WORK AND THEY LEAVE BECAUSE OF THAT. SO WE HAVE STARTED A SYSTEM WIDE -- TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT FACULTY WHO LEAVE. A AND IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE STARTED TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE -- WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THERE MIGHT BE BY RACE AND BY GENDER -- AND THE NEW PROGRAM THAT THAT JANET A PRE YES I'M SORRY YEAH AND AND THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME WE ARE PUTTING SOME OF THIS IS THE PRESIDENT'S MONEY. INTO PILOTS -- ON RETENTION. AND RECRUITMENT IS ONLY HALF THE STORY -- AND AND IF WE CAN'T KEEP THE AD MORE DIVERSE FACULTY OR HIRING WE ARE -- NEVER CAN HAVE THE KIND OF PROGRESS THAT WE WANT AND SO THAT THE SIX CAMPUSES HAVE. OF MONEY THIS YEAR TO DO AND THEY'VE DESIGN PROGRAMS THEY'VE GOT FACULTY ALREADY AT WORK ON FIGURING OUT HOW TO MAKE THEIR ENVIRONMENTS -- THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL THE FACULTY IN THEIR DEPARTMENT INCLUDING WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES AND WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT -- ALSO OB BROADER CLIMATE ISSUES -- ARE THAT THAT MOST OF US RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN YOU BRING A NONTRADITIONAL PEOPLE INTO AN ENVIRONMENT PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE ARE. LOTS OF NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS THESE NONTRADITIONAL PERSONS THEY GET SWAMPED BY THE OUR OB AT FOR GOOD REASONS FOR GOOD REASONS -- AND AND ARE A CHAIR MEDINA YOU YOU HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE EARLIER PANEL ABOUT -- HIGH. INVOLVEMENT IN ACADEMIC SENATE WHICH IS A VOLUNTEER ACTIVITY YOU YOU WILL FIND THEN THOSE THOSE PERSONS OF COLOR AND WOMEN WHO ARE FACULTY HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT HOW THEY SPEND THEIR TIME -- MOST OF THEM ARE TRYING TO ADVANCE THEMSELVES IN THEIR CAREER BUT MANY OF THEM FEEL AN OBLIGATION TO ADDRESS THE NEED. FOR THEIR MENTORSHIP FOR AND FOR THEIR SUPPORT IN THE LIVES OF THOSE STUDENTS. THAT IS TIME CONSUMING ARE AND FOR SOME OF THEM THEY MAKE A DECISION TO DO THAT THAN TO BE ENGAGED AND THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ACADEMIC SENATE. IN MY PARTICULAR CASE I SERVED IN THE ACADEMIC SENATE -- BUT I WAS A MEMBER NOT OF AN UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM WAS A MEMBER OF A GRADUATE PROGRAM. THE STUDENT A DIFFERENT. RESEARCH DEMANDS ARE ARE JUST THE SAME FOR THE FACULTY BUT THE THE STUDENT A MAN'S ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND I CHOSE TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF ACCESS AND MENTORSHIP AND SALSA. FOR BY INVOLVING MYSELF IN ADMISSIONS WORK. THE ACADEMIC SENATE'S COMMITTEE ON ON EMISSIONS WAS MY WAY OF DOING. BUT I I I I I I GUESS I WANTED TO SAY I APPRECIATED THAT EARLIER CONVERSATION WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS CRIME ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPORTING. THE LIVES OF THE NONTRADITIONAL PERSONS WE DO BRING INTO THESE ROLES. BACK THE ONE MARKED MADE YOU COULD ANSWER THIS BRIEFLY SO. YOU KNOW THIS IS ALL TALK UP HERE AND THEN PRACTICES IN. ON THE GROUNDS AT THESE. NINE UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES. SO AS WE HAVE THIS WAVE OF PEOPLE -- RETIRING WHAT IS THAT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FILLINGS POSITIONS AND HOW CAN WE BE ASSURED THAT AS MR MEDINA SAID WE DON'T GO BACK AND LOOK TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW AND SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT TO THE IN QUITE WORK OUT FEES. OUR ARE HIGH THAT THAT IS WHY BY THE WAY I HOPE. THERE IS AB DISK THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE SAKE OF THIS OF THE THE SERVICE THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SUPPOSED TO RENDER TO STATE I ACTUALLY SUPPORT. THIS KIND OF FOCUS ON AN ONGOING BASIS THAT'S NUMBER ONE WE WANT TO DO IT AND THE CAMPUSES ARE DOING IT ONGOING BASIS TO THE PRESIDENT HAS YEARLY FOCUS ON THESE VERY ISSUES AS WELL WE ARE ONLY THE ACCOUNTABILITY MAKE HOUSE TOM. OR A PROCESS ARE BOTH. BECAUSE WE WANT OUTCOME RESULT YES AN HOUR ACT WE BE ASSURED THAT WILL WILL BE CONFIDENT THAT WHAT SEATED. IT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS OUT OF FIRST OF ALL YOU YOU SHOULD AT HERE US PRESENT ON TWO FRONTS. BOTH IN TERMS OF THE OUTCOMES AND ALSO IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS THESE THAT WE PUT IN PLACE TO ATTAIN THOSE OUTCOMES. YOU YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO KNOW HOW HOW FUNCTIONAL THOSE PROCESSES ARE BUT YOU CAN JUST OUTCOMES BUT BY ATTENDING TO THE PROCESS THESE AS WELL IT HOW IT INDICATES THAT YOU HAVE AN INTEREST BY HOWELL WE EFFECT THESE CHANGES. WE OURSELVES AS PART OF THOSE PROCESSES OUGHT TO HAVE WITH OUR ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS THAT WE CAN ARTICULATE FOR YOU TOO BECAUSE THE ISSUE IS THAT SHARON'S RIGHT. AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT HOW I I HEAR YOU ARE -- OUR OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER OUT OF HIGH A MCCARTY -- YOU WANT TO HAVE ASSURANCE THE OTHER THING IS -- I I I WOULD INVITE YOU. TO TO PARTICIPATE WITH US IN ANY WAY YOU WOULD SEE FIT OFF SOME OF OUR A AND SOME OF OUR CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING ON OUR CAMPUSES. AROUND THESE ISSUES -- WHEN YOU LOOK AS AS AS CHAIR MEDINA SAID SO WELL AT THE HISTORY IT IS HARD TO TRUST OUR PRESIDENT IN OUR FUTURE? BUT HOW DO YOU BUILD TRUST IF YOU DON'T BUILD THE LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT -- AND AND I AM INTERESTED IN AND AND WHATEVER WE COULD DO TO BETTER EFFECT. MR MCCARTY. I'D I DON'T THINK THAT YOU HAVE IN OUR PACKET WHAT WAS PRESENTED TO THE REGIONS. THAT MULTI COLORED -- WITH THAT LOOKING AT AT HIRES I THINK. TRYING TO LOOK AT THE YEARS. AGAIN. THIS. ONE YOU SEE LATTER RANKIN FACULTY HIRES BY RACE AND ETHNICITY. GOES. 848-522-0009 TWO THOUSAND TEN I THINK THAT'S THE ONE THAT YOU PRESENTED TO THE REGENTS AND IN THEIR THE SEGMENT WITH THE MOLE STE GROWTH. IN NEW FACULTY HIRES DO YOU REMEMBER. OF PROSE BROWN WOULD SEGMENT THAT WAS IT WAS FOREIGN BORN. AND YEAH YEAH IT AND AND IT WAS. MUCH HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER CATEGORY -- BY A LOT. BY BY A WIDE MARGIN -- NO I I I COME. FROM IMMIGRANT PARENTS. YEAH MY FATHER WAS NOT BORN IN THIS COUNTRY I I WAS -- BUT BUT THERE I THINK THAT THAT SHOWS KIND OF A YOU KNOW I I GUESS I COULD REFER TO IT IT IS ALMOST. A TENSION. BETWEEN TRYING TO GROW OUR OWN [inaudible] HOME GROWN [inaudible] FACULTY. AND IT WHEN I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT G. CONNELL LAND NEXT TO GONNA LATINO -- AFRICAN AMERICAN WE WE ARE LOOKING AT FACULTY. FROM THIS COUNTRY THAT'S A AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA A COUPLE -- WENT WIN WIN I LOOK AT THE DATA CHICANO LATINO WE'RE NOT INCLUDING A RIGHT WE'RE NOT INCLUDING IF YOU CAME FROM SOUTH AMERICA OR WORD IT IS WE ALL PUT TOGETHER. TOPIC. I'M SORRY WE DECIDED ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO TO DISAGGREGATED THOSE TWO GROUPS SO THAT WE CAN TRACK DOMESTIC -- LITEON X. FACULTY AND INTERNATIONAL BECAUSE WE THOUGHT WE WERE MASKING THINGS IF WE DID IF WE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE LET ME ASK THE QUESTION WHAT WHAT WHY DO WE SEE. IS THERE ANY YOU KNOW WHAT EXPLANATION IS THERE FOR YOU KNOW WHY WHY SUCH A A RAPID GROWTH. OF FACULTY COMING. BEING FLETCHER A TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I SAW THAT -- TO MAYBE MAYBE SAYS GOOD SPEAK MORE TO IT BECAUSE I HAVE NOT STUDIED THE WIVES OF THAT I KNOW WITH CERTAIN STEM AREAS -- AWARE OF MOST OF THE CAMPUS HAS BEEN GROWING MORE RAPIDLY I COULD SEE WHY THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED SUSAN DO YOU KNOW MORE. WE DO IT IT'S AN INDICATION THAT WE WE RECRUIT INTERNATIONALLY -- AND THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE BE SURE WE WE HAVE A SENSE OF THE FULL. UP POOL OF APPLICANTS -- I THINK THE PERCENTAGE WENT UP OVER THAT TIME ABOUT 4% BUT THAT WAS A LARGER PERCENT THEN THE IT THE INCREASE IN THE UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY POPULATION. SET SO WE AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE WE WE'RE THAT IS OUT WE'RE NOT PUTTING -- RESOURCES INTO THAT -- I IF I COULD. THE AD REALLY AND AN ANSWER TO A PREVIOUS QUESTION YOU ASKED -- I THINK WHEN I MOST ENCOURAGED BY THERE'S A LOT TO NOT BE ENCOURAGED BY WHICH WE'RE HEARING YOU YOU ARE SHARE WITH US. I AM MOST ENCOURAGED BY THE FACT THAT THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT FOR THIS PROGRAM. ARE FOCUSED ON HOW WE EVALUATE CANDIDATES WHEN WE GET HUNDREDS OF APPLICANTS WE HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD WAY THAT'S NOT FULL OF BIAS -- TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S THE RIGHT PERSON FOR YOU SEE NOT WHO'S THE BEST PERSON IN THE WORLD HOWEVER YOU MIGHT DETERMINE THAT THE WHO'S THE RIGHT FACULTY. FOR YOU SEE AT OUR FOR OUR FACULTY MEMBERS HAVE -- SCENE THAT THEY CAN'T EVALUATE AS YOU'VE SUGGESTED WE WILL HAVE THE SAME RESULTS WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST SO THEY ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH. RUBRICS THEY'RE EXPERIMENTING WITH -- A PRIORITIZATION OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSITY STATEMENTS FROM ALL CANDIDATES. AND IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU INTERVENE IN A PROCESS -- LIKE EVALUATION. I AND I I I DO WANT OF THE WHAT WHAT YOU OF HER FROM US IS WHAT WHAT WE ARE DOING TO TRY TO BEND THE CURVE. TO CHANGE THE REALITIES OF THAT ARE AS AS A SOME WOMEN MCCARTY SAID THAT FORTY TWO YEARS. THREE YEARS DOWN THE LINE WE SHOW THAT WE ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING HERE. OB ARE THAT THAT WE DIDN'T THROWN A GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD THAT WE ACTUALLY TRIED TO AFFECT A NEW AGENDA IN THE NEW REALITY -- ARE. A MORE INCLUSIVE REALITY -- I I I THINK. FROM MY CHAIR I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE THE COMMITMENT SO REAL NOR THE POLICIES AND PROCESS THESE PUT IN PLACE TO THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE HAVE -- I'D ACT -- I'M HAPPY CAN WE LEARN TO DO THIS EVEN BETTER FOR EXAMPLE THE REALITY DID CHIU JUST A ONE OF YOU JUST IDENTIFIED ABOUT. OUT AND IT'S A REALITY THAT HAD AT THAT AFFLICTS RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE UNDERSTAND POSITION UP PROGRAMS A POSITION AT THE FRONTIERS OF KNOWLEDGE. THAT'S WHERE THEIR POSITION THEY'RE NOT MAKING GENERAL EDUCATION THEY'RE THEY'RE ALSO GENERATING NEW KNOWLEDGE AND THAT'S THAT THAT USUALLY IS A COMPLY WITH SOME. HYPER DIVERSIFICATION THAT HAPPENS AT THOSE FRONT TWO YEARS. AND SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY HIRE NISH SPECIALISTS. WHICH WHICH MAKES IT ACTUALLY Và HARDER TO GET DIVERSITY. BUT WHAT YOU ALSO FIND BECAUSE AND FACULTY FINING THIS THAT BECAUSE THE FRONTIERS OF KNOWLEDGE OF CHANGING MORE RAPIDLY. VERIFY THE ACTUALLY DOES GREATER VALUE IN HAVING MORE GENERALISTS. IN THEIR DEPARTMENTS AND THAT ACTUALLY WILL HELP OUT WITH WITH THE VERSE AT DIVERSIFYING THE DEPARTMENT SO YOU IDENTIFIED RIGHT PHENOMENA THE RIGHT WAY TO ATTACK IT. I'M NOT SAYING WE'VE WE'VE HIT UPON -- BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO FIND IT WELL. I THANK YOU BOTH. I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS. OF BECAUSE THIS IS A MATTER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE -- TO STUDENTS TO THE REGION'S AND TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WITH THAT WILL TRANSITION TO OUR THIRD PANEL WHICH WILL FOCUS ON CAMPUS BASED EFFORTS TO IMPROVING. OF FACULTY DIVERSITY. WE HAVE WITH US TODAY. THE VICE PROVOST FOR ACADEMIC PERSONNEL AT UC RIVERSIDE. I'M A WALKER. THE VICE PROVOST FOR ACADEMIC EQUITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION FROM UC IRVINE. DOUGLAS HAYNES. AND THE ASSOCIATE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR ACADEMIC DIVERSITY. AT UC DAVIS TRACK AS A DONOR. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH US. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- I AM OF COURSE FROM MISTER CHAIRMAN'S ALMA MATER AND I'VE JUST HEARD SOME THINGS THAT HE'S NOT SO HAPPY ABOUT IT RIVERSIDE BUT HOPEFULLY. I CAN EXPLAIN TO YOU SOME THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING THAT I THINK A VERY POSITIVE -- AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE -- RIVERSIDE HAS A HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED UNDERGRADUATE BODY THAT 45% OF THE UNDERGRADUATES AS OF THE FALL OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN IDENTIFIED AS BELONGING TO AN UNDER REPRESENTED GROUP [inaudible] BUT ALSO GIVEN THE WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING TODAY AND YOU KNOW THAT THE DIVERSITY AMONG THE FACULTY -- LAGS WAY BEHIND THAT -- AND THE A IN LATE. TWENTY FOURTEEN THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ACADEMIC YEAR -- THERE WAS -- A BIG PUSH ON OUR CAMPUS TO REALLY TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND I MIGHT POSE IT -- A RESPONSE TO ONE OF YOUR EARLIER ABOUT WHY WE MOVE SO SLOWLY I THINK SOMETIMES WE MODE MOVE SLOWLY AND ACADEMIA BECAUSE WERE USED TO ALSO CAN QUIT. VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. AND THEN ON THE BASIS OF THE RESULTS OF THAT THEN ASKING THE NEXT SPECIFIC QUESTION AND I'M A SCIENTIST AND THAT'S THE WAY SCIENCE WORKS. HOWEVER -- CERTAINLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WHEN I TOOK ON THIS POSITION WHICH WAS EXACTLY DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME I THOUGHT I DON'T WANT TO DO. A WHOLE BUNCH A LITTLE EXPERIMENT SO WHAT I WANT US TO DO IS OUR VERY BEST WITH ALL OF OUR BEST IDEAS AND SEE IF WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. SO I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE THAT WE'VE MADE. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT WE DID DO BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHICH ONE OF THOSE ACTUALLY BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE AND MAYBE IT WAS A GOOD COMBINATION OF ALL OF THEM. SO IT'S NOT A GOOD EXPERIMENT IS VERY POOR SCIENCE BUT NEVER THE LESS I THINK WE'VE ACHIEVED WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. SO INYO PACKETS YOU HAVE A HAND OUT THAT -- INCLUDES. A GRAPH HERE ON THE FIRST PAGE. AND WE INSTITUTED THE A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES WHERE THE RED ARROW IS WHICH IS BETWEEN THE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN ACADEMIC YEAH. AND BEFORE WE GET INTO. WHAT IT IS -- THAT WE ACTUALLY DID I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO LOOK AT THE THE RESULTS [inaudible] BEFORE -- THESE INTERVENTIONS IN THE THREE YEARS BEFORE THESE INTERVENTIONS THE INCOMING FACULTY WERE BETWEEN SOMETHING LIKE 10213% OF THE NW RECRUITS. OFF TO THESE INTERVENTIONS WE WENT UP TO ABOUT 22%. THE FIRST YEAR WE THOUGHT WELL THIS IS WONDERFUL IS THIS A ONE OFF HAVE WE ACTUALLY DONE SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT HERE. AND AS YOU CAN SEE WE'VE MANAGED TO REPLICATE THAT IN THE THREE YEARS PAAS THE INTERVENTIONS SO SO WE'VE ROUGHLY DOUBLED -- THE NUMBER OF UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY FACULTY IN THE INCOMING COHORT -- WE IN THE FIRST YEAR DIDN'T HAVE MUCH DIDN'T MAKE MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON THAT THE NUMBER OF NEW RECRUITS IDENTIFYING AS FEMALE BUT AFTER A LITTLE BIT MORE EFFORT. TO THOSE WENT UP -- NOW FROM ABOUT. 353-637-2407 PERCENT OF THE INCOMING FACULTY AND AGAIN THE FIRST YEAR WE WANT SOCIAL THIS WAS REAL BUT NOW WE'VE REPLICATED IT FOR A SECOND YEAR SO WE THINK. THAT WE'VE MADE SOME DIFFERENCES IN THAT REGARD. NOW WHAT DO WE DO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ON A CAMPUS IS THAT THERE'S A STRONG CONSISTENT MESSAGE FROM THE LEADERSHIP. AND THAT INCLUDES. SORT OF PUTTING THEIR MONEY WHERE THEIR MOUTH IS IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP AND AND I IT THAT'S WHY I HAVE THIS COMPASS IT. SET OF PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE LEADERSHIP AT THE UC CAMPUS WHICH ARE CLEARLY ILLUSTRATES THIS COMMITMENT TO AND THERE ARE -- AS FEMALE AND ABOUT 25% WHO ARE UNDER REPRESENTED -- TO FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. ALSO EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK ON OUR WEBSITE IT TALKS ABOUT -- THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY OUR INTEREST IN HIRING A DIVERSE FACULTY AND SO ON SO IT'S A CONSISTENT. PERSISTENT OP MESSAGE FROM THE TOP. THE SECOND THING WE DID WAS THAT IN OUR HIRING ADVERTISEMENTS WE PLACE TO VERY DELIBERATE -- SENTENCES -- ONE IS THAT YOU SEE ARE IS A WORLD CLASS RESEARCH UNIVERSITY WITH AN EXCEPTIONALLY DIVERSE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT BODY. ITS MISSION IS EXPLICITLY LINKED TO PROVIDING ROUTES TO EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS BALL UNDER REPRESENTED IN FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS A COMMITMENT TO THIS MISSION IS A PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS SO THIS GOES INTO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR ADVERTISEMENTS FOR FACULTY JOBS. THE SECOND THING THAT GOES IN IS -- A PHRASE THAT SAYS ADVANCEMENT THROUGH THE FACULTY RANKS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS THROUGH A SERIES OF STRUCTURED. MERIT BASED EVALUATIONS OCCURRING EVERY TWO TO THREE YEARS EACH OF WHICH HAS SUBSTANTIAL PIA INPUT. I YOU MIGHT NOT IMMEDIATELY IMAGINE WHY WE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA. BUT IF YOU. IF YOU'RE EITHER TRADITIONAL. UNIVERSITY AND YOU'VE DESCRIBED THEM AS HAVING A LOT OF WHITE MALE LEADERSHIP -- THEN THERE'S A TENDENCY AT MANY UNIVERSITIES TO GET AHEAD. BY WHO YOU KNOW WHO YOU PLAY GOLF WITH WHO YOU INVITE TO DINNER AND SO FORTH AND THAT'S NOT ALWAYS COMFORTABLE FOR WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY FACULTY -- TO FOR TO PARTICIPATE AND I KNOW IT CERTAINLY WASN'T FOR ME I DIDN'T LIKE THAT APPROACH TO LIFE AT OLE. SO I WANTED TO GO TO A PLACE JUDGED ON MY OWN ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND JUDGE FROM MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS BY MY PO'S RATHER THAN OF THE CHAIR. OF MY DEPARTMENT RATHER THAN THE DEAN I PLAYED GOLF WITH THE WHATEVER SO -- THAT'S WHY WE PUT THAT IN. HI -- THIRDLY WE REQUIRED A CONTRIBUTION TO DIVERSITY STATEMENT FROM OLD JOB CANDIDATES THIS IS TRUE FOR ALL STAFF AS WELL AS A FACULTY -- BUT THIS WAS NEW AT THAT TIME FOR THE FACULTY. AND IN THAT STATEMENT WE ALSO GAP WICCANS TO DESCRIBE THEIR PASTA POTENTIAL FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS TO PROMOTING A DIVERSE. EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS A KEY REQUIREMENT OF THE ROLE OF EVERY FACULTY MEMBER AT UC OFF. THERE ARE NUMEROUS WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE AND A COMMITMENT TO THIS PART OF OUR MISSION CAN BE REFLECTED THROUGH RESEARCH TEACHING SUPERVISION MENTORING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SERVICE AND ANY OF THE OTHER VERY THE ACTIVITIES THAT A PART OF AN ACADEMIC CAREER AND THAT'S I'M QUOTING FROM ONE OF OUR WEBSITES THAT. EXPLAINS IT A BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE. AND I THINK THAT WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT. BUT THE DIFFERENCE THAT THAT MAKES IT IS THAT IT ONCE AGAIN INDICATES OUR COMMITMENT. SO TO ALL THE PEOPLE ALL THE APPLICANTS FOR POSITIONS IT INDICATES OUR COMMITMENT -- I SUSPECT BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY DATA TO SUPPORT THIS THAT IT MIGHT DISCOURAGE SOME THAT HAVE DIFFERENT GOALS. AND THE NUMBER THREE IT GIVES US A BASIS TO DETERMINE THE FATE TO THE MISSION OF UC RIVERSIDE. SO HOW WE GOING TO TELL WHETHER SOMEONE IS -- COMMITTED TO OUR MISSION. THE FULL THING WE DID DOES THAT WE REQUIRE FULL SEARCH COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO TAKE BOTH AN ONLINE COURSE GOVERNING THE EXPECTATIONS AND LEGALITIES OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. IN AN ERA WITH PROPOSITION. TWO OH NINE AND ALSO AN IN PERSON INTERACTIVE ONE AND A HALF HOUR WORKSHOP. WHERE WE FOCUSED FIRST ON THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THE INITIATIVE WHAT ARE WE DOING THIS WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE? WHAT IT WHAT WE THINK IT'S GOING TO DO FOR OUR STUDENTS AND FAR OFF FACULTY -- WE ALSO FOCUS ON HOW TO RECOGNIZE AND OVERCOME IMPLICIT BIAS SEES. AND WE ALSO FOCUS ON HOW TO EVALUATE THESE CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSE CITY STATEMENTS SO WHAT WE DO IS GO THROUGH SOME EXAMPLES OF SUCH STATEMENTS AND WE TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THEM AND THEN WALKED COULD BE IMPROVED ABOUT THEM SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE. SOME IDEA HOW TO EVALUATE THEM BECAUSE THIS IS A NEW ASPECT OF AN APPLICATION. AND WE FOUND TO THAT PRIOR TO THIS TIME OFF FACULTY WERE FLOUNDERING A LITTLE ABOUT REALLY WHAT DO I DO WITH IT BUT IT WAS THERE BUT WHAT DO I DO WITH IT. AT THE WORKSHOPS WE ALSO EMPHASIZE THE TREMENDOUS TALENT POOL FOUND WITHIN THE CHANCELLOR'S AND PRESIDENT'S POST DOCTORAL. FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT EARLIER -- BUT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS -- AND USUALLY IT COMES OUT FROM THE DISCUSSIONS OF IMPLICIT BIAS SEASON ALSO THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSE CITY STATEMENTS. IS THAT WE HAVE PO'S TALKING TO PAY IS IN THE ROOM. IT IT DOESN'T WORK FOR SOMEONE TO STAND AT THE FRONT OF THE ROOM AND JUST SPELL OUT. WE REALLY ONCE. THE FACULTY TO BE TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER ABOUT VARIOUS ISSUES. AND EXACTLY HOW THESE SESSIONS GO VARIES TREMENDOUSLY SOMETIMES. THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST WONDERFUL YOU THINK WOW I'M SO GLAD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THESE FACULTY AND THEY EVEN APPLAUD AT THE END AND SOMETIMES. SHALL WE SAY WE GO OUT OF THERE FEELING AS IF WE'VE BEEN -- ATTACKED FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF. BUT EVEN IN THE ONES THAT DON'T WORK SO WELL AND IT IN SOME WAYS IN THE ONES THAT DON'T WORK SO WELL. DON'T KNOW NOT THEY DON'T WORK SO WELL DON'T COME OUT FEELING QUITE SO CONFIDENT THAT WITH MAKING PROGRESS -- I THINK WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS BECAUSE WE'VE STOOD UP THOUGHTS AND FACULTY OF HEARD FROM EACH OTHER ABOUT THEIR VARIOUS EXPERIENCES. AND EVEN THE FACULTY WHO. OF HAVE FULL BY INTO THE MISSION. BEFORE THEY GO INTO THESE WORKSHOPS BECAUSE THAT COMPULSORY -- THEY THEY STILL COME OUT RE ENERGIZE BECAUSE THEY REALIZE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO BECAUSE OF THE THINGS THEY'VE HEARD FROM THEIR FELLOW FACULTY SO. AND BECAUSE THESE A COMPULSORY AND WE'VE HAD THREE YEARS WE'VE NOW HAD 40% OR MORE THAN 40% OF THE ENTIRE LADDER RANK FACULTY GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND HAVE TO SIT THERE AND LISTEN. TO SOME OF US OF IN THIS PROCESS SO WE'RE MAKING AN IMPACT ON A VERY LARGE PROPORTION AND AS THE YEARS GO BY. ONE PRESUMES THAT THAT PERCENTAGE WILL GO UP. THE FIFTH THING WE DID IS -- THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED ONE OF THE ADVANCING FACULTY DIVERSE CITY. GRANTS THAT -- SUSAN AND PROGRAMS BROWN -- SORRY VICE PROVOST COLSON IMPROVISE BROWN WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. AND THIS WAS A PROGRAM IN ENGINEERING. AND ONE OF THE UNUSUAL POTS OF THAT PROGRAM WAS THAT WHEN THE APPLICATIONS K. MEN. THE THE A SEARCH COMMITTEE COULD ONLY INITIALLY SEE THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSE CITY STATEMENT AND THE RESEARCH STATEMENT SO THE RESEARCH STATEMENT TALKS ABOUT WHAT RESEARCH THE CANDIDATE HAD DONE. AND PROPOSES TO DO IN THE FUTURE. SO THOSE WITH THE TWO ELEMENTS THAT THEIR SEARCH COMMITTEE COULD SEE FIRST AND ONLY IF BOTH OF THOSE WERE REALLY GOOD. DID THE CANDIDATE ADVANCE TO THE NEXT STAGE OF REVIEW WHEN THEY STARTED TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW WHAT OF PUBLISHED WHERE DID THEY PUBLISH. AND SO FORTH. AND I THINK THE THE THE DATE AT THAT ACTUALLY SHOW THAT THIS MADE DIFFERENCE. IS THAT IN THE THE FINAL GRAAF HERE AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT COLORS USED FROM THE PREVIOUS GRAPH -- BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LEFT HAND SIDE THE A PANEL. IT GIVES YOU THE DISTRIBUTION OF CANDIDATES THAT MAKE IT TO THE SHORT LIST. NORMALLY IN HIRING DURING THE HIRING PROCESS IN ENGINEERING WHERE. 85% A MALE 99% UNKNOWN YOU ARE RAN. UP OBVIOUSLY THAN 15% OF FEMALE AND 1% -- U. R. M. -- AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE SHORT LIST THAT CAME OUT ALL OF THIS PROGRAM WHERE INSTEAD. THERE WAS THIS UP FRONT ANALYSIS OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIVERSITY STATEMENT TOGETHER WITH THE RESEARCH STATEMENT. ON THE SHORT LIST WAS A 100% FEMALE -- AND 50% UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY AND 50% NON UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY AND FROM THAT GROUP. THE FACULTY WHO WERE HIRED -- THERE WERE THREE FACULTY MEMBERS TWO OF WHOM IDENTIFIED AS UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES AND ALL THREE WERE FEMALE AND IN ENGINEERING OF BEING FEMALE MANGER ON UNDER REPRESENTED. MINORITY [inaudible] SO. WE HAD DATA TO SHOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS APPROACH SO. THREE FACULTY. IN TERMS OF NUMBERS IS NOT CONTRIBUTING VERY MUCH TO WHAT WE SAW HERE SO THAT THE OTHER EFFORTS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. FOR WHAT THIS -- ACTUAL EXPERIMENT THAT WAS DONE IN THE MAN OFTEN EXPERIMENT ALLOWED US TO DO WAS TO ACTUALLY THEN SHOW THE FACULTY AT THESE WORKSHOPS WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT CAN MAKE. AB AND I DID ALSO. IN THIS PROCESS BY LAW BY. DOING THE ANALYSIS ALL OF THE APPLICATIONS DIFFERENTLY WE MANAGED TO GET FACULTY FURTHER AWAY FROM. USING WHAT WE WOULD CALL A PROXY MET THE PROXY MEASURES ALL OF QUALITY. AND ACADEMIC PEDIGREE. SO THERE IS A TENDENCY AND YOU YOU SORT OF ALLUDED TO THIS IDEA THAT OR SOMEONE DID THAT THAT. IF. YOU YOU LIKE FACULTY WHO LOOK LIKE YOU THINK LIKE YOU AND I GOING TO DO THE SAME KIND OF THINGS AS YOU. BECAUSE YOU FEEL SECURE IN THAT USE FEEL SECURE IN YOUR EVALUATION -- BY LOOK BY ANALYZING JUST THE RESEARCH STATEMENT. RATHER THAN WHERE THEY DID THEIR DEGREE -- AND BY ANALYZING THEIR COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY YOU YOU TOOK ON BOARD PEOPLE WHO WERE EXCELLENT IN RESEARCH BUT ALSO HAD A TRUE COMMITMENT TO THE MISSION OF THE UNIVERSITY AND IT CLEARLY HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN DATED MEMBERS OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE -- FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR LOCAL ACTIVITIES AT UC IRVINE TO ADVANCE FINALLY DIVERSITY -- OF COURSE MY NAME IS DOUGLAS HAYNES EMMA ACADEMIC ADMINISTRATOR BUT I'M ALSO A FACULTY MEMBER. I'VE BEEN AT UCI FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS AS A MODERN EUROPEAN HISTORIAN. I'M A FORMER UC PRESENCE POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW. I'M THE YOUNGEST OF NINE IN A NATIVE OF CALIFORNIA BORN IN SAN FRANCISCO. IS SO THIS IN SOME SENSES COMING FULL CIRCLE THIS HEARING. ABOUT WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON OF OUR COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM TO ADVANCE BADLY DIVERSITY AT UC IRVINE. I'M GONNA TALK FIRST -- ABOUT THE OVERALL CURRENT STRATEGY. THEN I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE TARGET RECRUITMENT EFFORT -- THROUGH THE RESOURCES OF THE LEGISLATURE WE'RE ABLE TO PURSUE LAST YEAR ENTITLED BUILDING OUR OWN PIPELINE. TO THE STEM PROFESSORIAL. THEN I'LL FOCUS ON THE PRECISE CONCIERGE RECRUITMENT STRATEGY THAT WE USE. TO YIELD ON PRESIDENT A NUMBER OF UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES AS WELL AS WOMEN -- IN OUR FOR THREE STEM SCHOOLS AND FINALLY I WANT TO FOCUS ON RETENTION. AND AS MENTIONED EARLIER BY PROVOST -- BROWN AND OTHERS IT'S IS A MUCH ABOUT RETENTION AS A RECRUITMENT WHEN IT COMES TO UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES AND WOMEN. IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION ENTERPRISE. YOU SEE I AS A HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION AS WELL AS AN ASIAN AMERICAN NATIVE AMERICAN PACIFIC ARE OTHER INSTITUTION. WE ARE RARE INSTITUTION AMONG THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITIES TO HAVE THAT DUAL DESIGNATION IT'S ALSO SHARED BY UC SANTA BARBARA. AND RECENTLY UC DAVIS WILL BE A H. S. I CAMPUS AS WELL. AS A MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE ANIMATES UCI'S COMPREHENSIVE FACULTY RECRUITMENT STRATEGY. THE STRATEGY CONSIST OF HIRING TO NATIONAL AVAILABILITY. ENGAGING THE BROADEST CROSS SECTION OF TALENTED RESEARCHERS AND SCHOLARS. AND IF USING ACCOUNTABILITY WITH ACT A KEY MILESTONE TO THE SEARCH PROCESS. THIS STRATEGY IS FORTIFIED IN THREE KEY WASTE. ALL APPLICANTS FOR FAMILY POSITIONS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A STATEMENT MY CONTRIBUTION TO DIVERSITY. DEAN'S ARE DIRECTED TO OUT REACH TO THEIR NATIONAL PEERS DRYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE CAMPUS COMMITMENT TO INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE. AND SCHOOL BASS EQUITY ADVISES PROVIDE OPERATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY. THEY SHARE BEST PRACTICES WITH COMMITTEES WHILE MONITORING SEARCH SEARCH IS A KEY MILESTONES. THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO PAUSE IN THE SEARCH IN WHICH THERE IS AN UNEXPLAINED DIVERGENCE BETWEEN FIELD NATIONAL AVAILABILITY. AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE APPLICANT POOL AND PROPOSE SHORTLISTS. ONE OF THE EARLY -- ITEMS TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO IS IT ORG CHART OF MY OFFICE. ON THE LEFT YOU'LL SEE A BOX THAT LIST THE SEVENTEEN EQUITY ADVISORS. THERE'S ONE IN EACH OF THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS THAT AS I DESCRIBED THEY PROVIDE THE OPERATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR EACH REGULAR FACTLY SEARCH. I WANT MOVED UP -- PART TWO WHICH IS GOING TO FOCUS ON OUR BUILDING OUR OWN PIPELINE TO THE STEM PROFESSORIAL. THAT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUPPORT FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE IT'S PLAYED A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE. IN THIS INITIATIVE. LAST FALL PENSION AND DISHES FACTORY HIRING PROGRAM -- WE'RE AND WE SOUGHT TO HIRE EIGHT FORMER YOU SEE PRESIDENT'S OR YOU SEE AYE CHANCES POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS. INTO OUR STEM -- SCHOOLS WE SUCCEEDED IN HIRING. EIGHT ACROSS THREE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS. THEY ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THE FOLLOWING WAY FIVE IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES TO AN INFORMATION COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ONE IN ENGINEERING. THESE HIGHLY PROMISING EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS NOT ONLY WILL ADD TO THE RESEARCH AND TEACHING COMPASSION THE CAMPUS. BUT ALSO WILL HELP US DIVERSIFY THE FACULTY INCONSEQUENTIAL WAYS. AND I NEED TO UNDERSCORE THE SEVERITY OF UNDER REPRESENTATION IS PARTICULARLY -- PATENT IN OUR STEM SCHOOLS SO FIVE OF THE EIGHT NEW FACULTY ARE WOMEN. THREE IN BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES TO AN INFORMATION COMPUTER SCIENCE IN ONE AN ENGINEERING. FIVE OF THE EIGHT ARE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED RACIAL GROUPS THREE AFRICAN AMERICANS AND TO HISPANIC OR LATIN NECKS. TO OF THE EIGHT ARE WOMEN OF COLOR AND I NEED TO UNDERSCORE THIS THIS SEGMENT OF THE ACADEMIC WORKFORCE IS EXTREMELY UNDERREPRESENTED IN STEM FAMILIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. NOT JUST DID YOU SEE. THE IMPACT OF THE PILOT PROGRAM ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DIVERSITY OF REGULAR HIRES. ITEM -- YOU'LL SEE THE FIGURE. THAT. HIRES ACCOUNTED FOR LAST YEAR FOR RENTS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE HIRING OF UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES IN OUR STEM SCHOOLS IN COMPARISON TO THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THESE NEW HIRES PUSH THE OVERALL PERCENTAGE OF FORMER FELLOWS. ON THE CAMPUS FACULTY 23%. AND I HAVE A LIST OF FORMER FELLOWS WHO CURRENTLY ON THE FAMILY YOU SEE I THAT'S THE ITEM. THREE I WOULD MOVE -- TO THE THIRD PARTY BY PRESENTATION WHICH FOCUSES ON THE RECRUITMENT STRATEGY THAT WE DEPLOYED IN BUILDING OUR OWN PIPELINE TO THE STAMP PROFESSORIAL. THE ADVANCING FINALLY DIVERSITY GRAD ENABLE THE CAMPUS TO COMBINE EXISTING PROGRAMS INTO A COHERENT TWO PART STRATEGY. THIS STRATEGY INCENTIVIZE THE HIRING OF FORMER FELLOWS AN INVESTOR DIRECTLY IN THEIR FUTURE CAREER SUCCESSES FACULTY. AS EXPLICIT PART OF THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS. THE PROVOST MAXIMIZE UTILIZATION OF THE UC PRESENTS HIGHER INCENTIVE BY MATCHING EACH INSTEAD OF HIGHER. WITH FOUR FULLY FUNDED F. T. E.'S FOR TOTAL OF EIGHT POTENTIAL HIRES. SCHOOLS IN TURN. ADOPTED A CONCIERGE RECRUITMENT STRATEGY WHERE AN EACH SCHOOL DEAN PASTOR EQUITY ADVISER. TO SERVE AS A TRUSTED RESOURCE ABOUT THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS. CAMPUS WORK LIFE BALANCE TOOLS AND OTHER RESOURCES. THE CAMPUS UNDERSCORE ITS COMMITMENT TO THE CARE SUCCESS OF THESE FELLOWS AS FACULTY IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. EACH NEW FACULTY MEMBER RECEIVED A SIXTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR AUGMENTATION TO THEIR STARTER BUDGET. AND A GRANT FOR THE TUITION TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE FACULTY SUCCESS PROGRAM. A FEATURED GRAHAM OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR FACULTY DEVELOPMENT DIVERSITY. FINALLY THE CAMPUS STEPS TO SOCIETY OF INCLUSIVE ACTIONS FELLOWS TO CREATE A VINEYARD FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY AMONG NEW AND FORMER FELONS. FINALLY I WANT TO TURN TO THE FOURTH PART AND THAT IS RETAINING AND ADVANCING FACULTY. AND AGAIN THE BUILDING OUR PIPELINE TO THE STEM PROFESSORIAL DEMONSTRATED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO DIVERSIFY THE FACULTY. RAPIDLY. BUT IS NOT ENOUGH TO HIRE DIVERSE FACULTY. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO SUPPORT THEIR TRANSMIT. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN YOU SEE I RECEIVED A SECOND ADVANCING FINALLY DIVERSITY GRANT. TO PILOT A KERR CAREER CONCIERGE APPROACH TO INCREASE FACULTY RETENTION AMONG THE STEM SCHOOLS. IT ORGANIZES CAREER ADVISING OR MENTORING FOR NEW FACULTY BASED ON A TEAM OF SENIOR COLLEAGUES RATHER THAN A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL. THE TEAM COLLABORATES TO SUPPORT THE RESEARCH TEACHING AND SERVICE PRIORITIES THE JUNIOR FACULTY MEMBER WHILE PREPARING THEM FOR THE CRITICAL THIRD YEAR APPRAISAL. THEY WILL PROVIDE INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE INNOVATIVE TEACHING AND RESEARCH PRACTICES PATHWAYS TO TENURE AT PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE. THESE CAREER TEAMS WILL BE COMPLEMENTED BY MONTHLY WORKSHOPS AND FUNDING FOR CAREER TRAVEL AWARDS TO SUPPORT MENTOR AND JUNIOR FACULTY PARTICIPATION. AND CAREER BUILDING PROFESSIONAL -- MEETINGS OUT WE HAVE A LOGIC MODEL THAT WE PROVIDE IT AT THE END OF OUR PACKET THAT DESCRIBES -- THE INPUTS AND THE OUTCOMES THAT WE EXPECT FROM UTILIZING THIS GRANT -- FROM THE ADVANCING FOUND THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CHAIRED AMOUNTS AND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. SO I KNOW I'M YOUNGER THAN YOU -- BUT ACTUALLY IT'S BEEN OVER TWENTY YEARS SINCE I I WAS A LAW STUDENT AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL. AND THE CO CHAIR OF THE VALLEY AND SARAH. IN FOUR YEARS LANCE I HAD BEEN ADVOCATING. FOR THE HIGHER OF AT LEAST ONE IN THE HISTORY OF THE LAW SCHOOL SINCE ITS FOUNDING. IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN WHO WAS LATIN ACTS. THEN I WENT BACK TWENTY YEARS LATER FOR MY REUNION IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE LAW SCHOOL HAD ONLY HIGHER. TO FACULTY WHO IDENTIFIED AS LATINO. AND AS THE ALUMNI MET WITH THE YOUNG GENERATION OF LIONS OF STUDENTS -- IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY STILL FELT LONELY. AND ISOLATED IN THE EXPERIENCE -- I GUESS I CAN SHARE THE STORY FOR TWO REASONS -- ONE IS TO THANK YOU BECAUSE WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT WOULD HAVE MADE IF. THE MASSACHUSETTS LEGISLATURE HAD JURISDICTION TO TELL HARD ROAD WHAT TO DO -- BUT ALSO IF THEY HAD DEMONSTRATED THE COMMITMENT THAT YOU ARE DEMONSTRATING. TODAY I THINK THAT MANY OF US WHO FELT SO LONELY IN OUR ASK. WOULD HAVE FELT REALLY EMPOWERED SO I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT -- I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT -- WE ARE DOING BETTER THAN HARVARD LAW SCHOOL EVEN AS THEY DO HAVE MORE RESOURCES -- I JOINED UC DAVIS A YEAR AND A HALF AGO ROUGHLY AND WHEREAS I SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION AND URGENCY WITH. OUR WHAT WE SEE IS A LACK OF PROGRESS IN. OUR DIVERT THE FACULTY RANKS -- IT'S NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING AND I DO WANT TO TELL YOU A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN. DOING -- BUT IN MY REMARKS I DO WANT REFER. TO AND THERE WAS A BLUE FOLDER AND THERE'S A HAND OUT -- AND I WANT TO START WITH THE SECOND PAGE -- THERE IS A GRAPH THAT MY ANALYSTS PUT TOGETHER THAT I THINK IT'S A VERY TELLING CRAFT AND MAY PROVIDE. SOME OF THE REASONS WHY WE STRUGGLE SO MUCH TO DIVERSIFY THE FACULTY ONE SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT KIND OF GIVES US A PICTURE OF THE FACULTY AT UC DAVIS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY THE DATE OF HIRE. AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT. THE FACULTY AT UC DAVIS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AT LEAST ONE OF THEM. DATES BACK ALL THE WAY TO NINETEEN SIXTY SIX THAT'S WHEN THEY WERE HIRED. THAT MEANS THAT. OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO SO WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT IS THAT ONCE HIRED FACULTY STAY IN GENERAL FOR A REALLY REALLY LONG TIME AT INSTITUTIONS. BUT THE OTHER IMPORTANT PICTURE OF THIS GRAPH RIGHT IS THAT WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT WE HAVE A LEGACY OF WHITENESS RIDE IS THAT WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY START TO HIRE. WITH DIVERSE CITY UNTIL THE MORE RECENT YEARS AND QUITE FRANKLY FROM AT LEAST FROM WHERE I SIT. WE CAN ONLY REALLY HIGHLIGHT -- ANY REAL MOVEMENT IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS OR SO -- FOR TWO REASONS ONE IS BECAUSE WE ARE. A HIRING WITH GREATER DIVERSITY. BUT IT'S NOT JUST A CERTAIN TYPE OF DIVERSITY IN PREVIOUS YEARS YOU KNOW DIVERSITY WAS NOT THAT IT'S NOT AND IT'S NOT A A DIG AGAINST IF WE DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF RANGE IN THE TYPES OF DIVERSITY THAT WENT BUT THAT WAS BEING. HIRED AT UC DAVIS UNTIL THE LAST SEVEN YEARS OR SO. SO I THINK THAT'S THE TELEGRAPH. AND I THINK PART OF THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES WHAT'S DIFFERENT YOU KNOW WHAT IS. HAPPENING IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS OR SO THAT'S MAKING. A DIFFERENCE I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT -- I GUESS. TO A PIGGY BACK OFF OF VICE PROVOST FOR AB PROPOSED BROWN'S ENTHUSIASM. I'M I DO THINK THAT. THIS IMAGE OF DIVERSITY CREATE THE CRITICAL MASS AND I DO BELIEVE THAT ONCE YOU HAVE A CRITICAL MASS. I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU SEE A REPLICATION OF THE SAME SIMILAR TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS THAT I HOPE WILL WILL AT SPEED UP SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE ARE UNDERTAKING AT LEAST THAT'S MY HOPE -- BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT IS DIFFERENT THE TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN. DOING -- ON THE NEXT PAGE -- WE TRY TO SHOW YOU -- THROUGH THESE VERY AS BLUE CIRCLES WHAT THE HIRING PROCESS LOOKS LIKE AT UC DAVIS FROM RECRUITMENT ALL THE WAY THROUGH. HIGHER AND ON THE SIDE WE'VE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE PARTICULARLY IN RECENT YEARS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE -- THE WAY THAT WE HIGHER WITH. DIVERSITY. I'M GONNA HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW OF THOSE INTERVENTIONS. BUT I DO WANT TO SAY. THAT. IN MY MIND THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO SUCCESS THAT I THINK ARE CRITICAL TO HIGHLIGHT. I'M FIRST IS THAT MOST OF THESE INNOVATIONS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED BY COMMITTED AND ENGAGE FACULTY. AND WITH SUPPORT OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE -- I HAPPEN TO JOIN UC DAVIS -- RECENTLY AFTER WE RECEIVED A GRANT FROM ADVANCE THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION IN. TWENTY TWELVE AND THE OTHER SOUTH SAID. FIRST OF ALL IT WAS A BUNCH OF WOMEN SCIENTIST. WHO SAW AROUND TODAY SAID WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO DO THINGS LIKE THIS WE HAVE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE? AND THEY WANT TO THE AND THE STAFF AND THEY TRIED A COUPLE OF TIMES THE FIRST TIME IN SUCCESSFULLY THE SECOND TIME. BECAUSE THE NSF SAID YOU GOTTA FOCUS ON STEM AT THE INTERSECTION OF RACE AND GENDER -- AND IT WAS REALLY THIS COLLECTIVE EFFORT OF THE FACULTY WITH A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION LEADERSHIP. THAT RESULTED IN. THE HIGHER OF NARAL THIRTY FACULTY MEMBERS WHO ARE BRINGING MULTICULTURAL PERSPECTIVE SINCE DAM -- TO UC DAVIS AND AND I BELIEVE IN THAT MODEL SO ONE OF THE FIRST PRESCRIPTIONS. IS THE COMMITMENT OF FACULTY SUPPORT OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE BUT OBVIOUSLY CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH A ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERSHIP. I'M THE SECOND THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT. PEOPLE WILL DO THIS JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO WHAT I HAVE LEARNED IS THAT YOU KINDA NEED CARROTS IT'S THE REALITY CHANGING CULTURE IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO DO. AND UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES THAT REQUIRES INTENSE INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THE CARE VERSUS HAVE MATTERED -- IN I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THAT OUR PARTNERS IN THAT REGARD ARE IMPORTANT INCLUDING YOUR PARTNERSHIP UC DAVIS HAS RECEIVED. TWO GRANTS TOTALING MORE THAN THEM MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO INNOVATE SO WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT -- I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT UC DAVIS HAS ALSO INVESTED SUBSTANTIALLY TO AND INCENTIVIZE HIRING. WITH DIVERSE AND I WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION. TO THIS THAT THE NEXT PAGE AND THAT SHOWS -- AT THE VERY BOTTOM YOU SEE THESE LITTLE FIGURES. THAT INCLUDES THE THIRTY HIGHER IS THAT WE HAVE DONE WITH MULTI CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES ALL OF THEM CAME AS A RESULT OF INCENTIVES AND THE INCENTIVES. ARE IN THE AMOUNT OF EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS TO INCENTIVIZE THESE HIRES AND THAT'S GOING TO BE A A STEADY COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF UC DAVIS IS AN OVER. THREE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TO DO WHAT'S THIRTY HIGHER OF THIRTY FIVE FACULTY -- AND THEN AS THEY READ AS THE CYCLE OUT OF THE FIVE YEARS OF INCENTIVIZE MONIES WE HIRE MORE SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT THIS MODEL WHICH HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL SO FAR WILL CONTINUE TO HELP US. TO INCREASE THE NUMBERS. I WANT TO SAY THAT PROCESS MATTERS A LOT AND ONE OF THE THINGS AND CHAIRMAN MEDINA THAT YOU MENTIONED WAS. THE TENDENCY -- WANTING TO REPLICATE YOURSELF -- AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT -- IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE MANY WAYS INCENTIVIZING THROUGH THE NEW GRANT THAT WERE RECEIVED FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE. BUT ALSO -- USING A BIT OF A STICK MODEL TO FOREST'S NOT FORCE BUT REALLY REALLY INCENTIVIZE OPEN SEARCHES. RIGHT RATHER THAN THE SPECIALIZED NARAL SEARCHES THAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED -- IN EIGHT COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS -- AND THE DEANS HAVE COMMITTED TO THAT MODEL -- I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY ALSO COMMITTED. TWO A MODEL WHERE THEY WILL ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERSHIP INCLUDING MYSELF AND MANY OTHERS. TO SIT AS PART OF THE HIRING COMMITTEES AND IN ORDER. TO TALK ABOUT THE BEST PRACTICES THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING AND ENSURING THAT THEY ARE PRESENT. THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES I THINK ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE DOING THAT. BUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES DO MATTER AND THEY FUNCTION VERY SIMILARLY. ACROSS CAMPUSES WHICH IS THAT. WE DO ASK. EVERY SINGLE SEARCH TO GIVE US THEIR NUMBERS IN TERMS OF THE SHORT LIST THE AND THE ALSO THE NUMBER OF CANDIDTES. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BRING BACK TO CAMPUS TO YOU AND WE COMPARE THEM AGAINST NORMS -- FOR BASICALLY THE SHORTLIST ARE REVIEWED TO ENSURE THAT THE APPLICANT POOL AND SELECTED CANDIDATES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE WORKFORCE AVAILABILITY POOL. AND WHERE IS THIS IS SORT OF A SOFT PRESSURE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEES I DO FIND THAT TEENS DON'T WANT TO GET THAT CALL FROM THE VICE PROVOST TO SAY WHY IS THERE NO MATCH. AND I DO THINK IT CREATES A CULTURE OF KNOWING THAT THE INSTITUTION CARES ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND IT SLOWLY STARTS TO CHIP AWAY AT THE NON ACCOUNTABILITY IN WHICH FACULTY HAVE GENERALLY HIRED IN THE PAST. I WANT TO TALK ALSO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- RETENTION. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS HAND OUT OF WE'VE LISTED SOME OF THE IT RETENTION INITIATIVES AND BECAUSE OF TIME. I WON'T TALK ABOUT ALL OF THOSE INITIATIVES. BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUST TWO ONE IS ONE THAT I HAVE BEEN LEADING WITH -- A FACULTY DIRECTOR MARY LOU DELLUMS FEELINGS AND SO THE FACULTY SCHOLARS THAT WE MENTION TO YOU THE THIRTY FACULTY SCHOLARS THEY ARE PART OF A COHORT OF FACULTY. THAT WE CALLED CAMPBELL'S AND CUMPLE STAND A MULTIPLE CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES ON SCIENCE. SO WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THEIR PRESENCE ON CAMPUS WAS GONNA BE TRANSFORMATIVE BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE SUPPORTED AND MADE VISIBLE AND THAT THERE THAT THEY WE NEEDED TO BUILD A COMMUNITY AROUND THEM. AND I AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT -- WE HAVE DONE THAT QUITE SUCCESSFULLY AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO REPLICATE. ON A SIMILAR MODEL FOR FOR FACULTY IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES HUMANITIES AND THE ARTS. I'M LET ME -- FINALLY TALK ABOUT THE PIPELINE TO THE PROFESSORIAL BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT ALSO DELAYS THE RATE AT WHICH WE CAN DIVERSIFY FACULTY. I PROVIDE -- IN THE HANDOUT THAT WE GAVE YOU -- SOMEONE THE SECOND TO LAST PAGE. SOME OF THE DATA ON NATIONAL STATISTICS ON I'M ACTUALLY THAT'S A VERY LAST PAGE STATISTICS ON STUDENTS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL TODAY AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AT LEAST. FOR TWENTY FIFTEEN IT'S DISTRESSING TO SEE THAT ONLY 6% OF GRADUATE -- DEGREES ARE EARNED BY INDIVIDUALS WHO IDENTIFIED AS HISPANIC OR LATIN ACTS AND ONLY AS BLACK OF OR AFRICAN AMERICAN. LAST WEEK AYE PARTICIPATED IN THIS INCREDIBLE -- FORUM FUNDED THROUGH THE MAILING GRANT FOUNDATION ON IT'S A NEW INITIATIVE THE WE ARE SPEARHEADING CALLED THE ALLIANCE FOR MULTI CAMPUS INCLUSIVE GRADUATE ADMISSIONS OR AMIGA. THIS GRANT IS GETTING THE ELITE INSTITUTIONS LIKE UCLA -- UC'S AT UC DAVIS AND USC TO COME TOGETHER TO TO HAVE A MUCH MORE HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE WAY THAT WE ASSESS MERIT. IN ORDER. TO ADMIT STUDENTS INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL. AND IT WAS A ROOM FULL OF ACADEMICS HAVING A REALLY HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT. HOW OUR RELIANCE ON THE JURY E. THE CITY HAS BEEN A RACIALIZED PROJECT? THAT HAS CREATED A MERITOCRACY THAT EXCLUDES PEOPLE AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I WAS ASKED TO GIVE THE KEYNOTE ADDRESS. AND I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BE CRITICAL IN THE WAY THAT I SPEAK -- AND I IN MY TITLE A TITLE THAT THE LESSONS THAT BAKI OFFERS TO HOLISTIC ADMISSIONS. MAN I TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE WAY THAT WE HAVE FRAME THE LANGUAGE A MERITOCRACY -- MEANS THAT WE PLACE LEE CREATED AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND AND RACE BASED ADMISSIONS RATHER THAN CHALLENGING THE VERY CORE. WHICH IS ALL OF MERITOCRACY WHICH IS THAT IT ACTUALLY DOES THE WORK JERRY'S DOES NOT DO NOT MEASURE SUCCESS AND THEY'RE NOT EFFECTIVE AT HELPING US TO MEASURE SUCCESS. AND WHAT I WANT TO TELL YOU IS THAT I WAS SO. INSPIRED BY A GROUP OF FACULTY WHO AGREE WITH THAT PREMISE AND WHO ARE REALLY TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN GRADUATE ADMISSIONS -- SO THIS IS ALL TO SAY I WE WERE WE NEED TO BE ABSOLUTELY NOT. BUT I DO THINK WE'RE TRYING IS THAT ENOUGH AS A METRIC I'M NOT SURE BUT I HOPE I HOPE THE REASON I'M HERE. AND AT UC DAVIS BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN EASY JOB IS BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF WE TRY -- BUT WE NEED YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND AND AND YOUR PATIENCE ARM AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO US AND SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. BEING THE LAST MEMBER HERE. I I'M GOING TO SKIP ANY QUESTIONS OR BECAUSE I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AND I CERTAINLY WANT TO HAVE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF APPRECIATE -- THE THE VIEW FROM THE CAMPUSES SO THANK. AND WITH THAT WE'LL GO. TO OUR FOURTH PANEL. SO WOULD LIKE TO HEAR AND KNOW MORE ABOUT. UNDER REPRESENTED FACULTY. THE BALANCE IN THEIR CLASSROOM ROSE AND IN MANY CASES THEIR DEFAULT ROLES OF BEING MENTORS TO UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS WHICH WE'VE. BEEN HEARING ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE THE HEARING. AS A FORMER TEACHER I CANNOT LEAVE OUT STUDENTS AND AS A MATTER OF FACT WITHOUT LOOKING AT THIS. YOU KNOW THE STUDENTS ARE THE REASON FOR US BEING HERE -- THE REASON IS IS FOR OUR VERY BEING. AND SO I'D LIKE TO WELCOME. CHAIR OF THE UC AFFIRMATIVE ACTION DIVERSITY EQUITY COMMITTEE. BLOCKS TO P. AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION. CAROLINE SEGAL'S. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WELCOME [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE MEDINA. I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON ON THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF FIVE FACULTY DIVERSITY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING THE FACULTY PERSPECTIVE -- IN THIS HEARING. MY NAME IS LAW SEE YOU AND I AM A FACULTY MEMBER AT IN THE ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENT AT UC BERKELEY. I WAS ALSO A AN ALUMNI OF THE UC BERKELEY -- UP CAMPUS AS WELL. THE ACADEMIC SENATE PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN SHARED GOVERNANCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE SENATE WORKS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP POLICIES FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY. I CHAIR THE SYSTEM Y. ACADEMIC SENATE UNIVERSITY COMMITTEE ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION DIVERSITY AND EQUITY. YOU CANNOT FOR SHORT. THIS COMMITTEE CONSIDERS GENERAL POLICIES THE CONCERN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION DIVERSITY AND EQUITY AN ACADEMIC PERSONNEL AND ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. AS A FIRST GENERATION WOMAN OF COLOR FACULTY AT UC BERKELEY. I'M INTENSELY AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT MANY WOMEN AND RACIAL MINORITY STUDENTS AND FACULTY FACE. I TEACH IN THE AND THE ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENT AFTER ALL. GRADUATE STUDENTS MOSTLY WOMEN AND RACIAL MINORITIES COME SEEKING NOT JUST RESEARCH SUPPORT BUT ALSO PROFESSIONAL MENTORING -- PROJECTS COVER A VARIETY OF ISSUES THEY COME FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND SCHOOLS. ONE STUDENT IN AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES DID RESEARCH ON MAROON DESCENDED COMMUNITIES IN THE U. S. SELF. ANOTHER COMMUNITY ANOTHER STUDENT IN SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE TO STUDYING REPRESENTATIONS OF INDIGENOUS. PEOPLES AND ASIAN MIGRANTS IN LATIN AMERICAN LITERATURE. AND ANOTHER STUDENT ETHNIC STUDIES IS COMPLETING HER DISSERTATION ON THE AGING LATINO POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES. I CANNOT ALWAYS CLAIM SPECIFIC BUT I AM ALWAYS WILLING TO SUPPORT AND GUIDE THEM. I LISTEN TO THEIR FRUSTRATIONS THEIR FEARS OF FAILURE AND THEIR DREAMS OF MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND I MENTOR THEM BY SHERRY LESSONS I HAVE. AND ADVICE ON HOW TO NAVIGATE BOTH THE RESEARCH PROCESS AS WELL AS THE ACADEMY. AS A CURRENT MEMBER OF OUT TO YOU SEE AND AS AN ALUMNA I UNDERSTAND IN THE MOST PROFOUND WAY THE NEED TO DIVERSIFY OUR FACULTY. AS CHAIR OF YOU CANNOT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU OUR CURRENT INITIATIVES THAT HELP ADVANCE FACULTY DIVERSITY. AS WELL AS THE HIGHLIGHT ONE PARTICULAR AREA WHERE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IS WELCOME AND NEEDED. TO DIVERSIFY FACULTY AT UC WE MUST FIRST CREATE A SOLID PIPELINE FOR WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY SCHOLARS TO ENTER INTO LETTERING POSITIONS. I THINK YOU'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT ABOUT THAT AMONG THE EARLIER PANELS. TO ACHIEVE IN DURING A MEANINGFUL CHANGE WE NEED TO TRANSFORM BOTH THE CULTURAL NORMS AND THE INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES. INITIATIVES THAT YOU CAT IS UNDERTAKING THIS YEAR AIM TO ADDRESS BOTH. FIRST YOU CANNOT IS PROPOSING AN EXPANSION OF THE PRESIDENT'S POST DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE GROWING NEEDS IN THE HIRING OF THESE FELLOWS. AS A SIGNATURE PROGRAM AT THE YOU SEE SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE PRESIDENT'S POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW PROGRAM IS A COMPETITIVE PROGRAM THAT OFFERS TWO YEAR RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND FACULTY MENTORING TO OUTSTANDING SCHOLARS WHO'S WORKED CAN AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO DIVERSITY. AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AT UC. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE FOLLOWS HAVE BEEN HIRED INTO THE UC. CURRENTLY HIRING TRENDS -- AND RECENT CHANGES IN THE HIRING INCENTIVE AWARDS PROGRAM INDICATE THAT THE DEMAND FOR HIRING THESE FELLOWS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. IN ORDER TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND AND HIRING WE ARE RECOMMENDING AN INCREASE. IN THE NUMBER A FELLOWSHIPS. AWARDS THE FELLOWSHIP AWARDS FROM TWENTY TO FORTY ESSENTIALLY DOUBLING THE CURRENT NUMBER OF FELLOWSHIP AWARDS. DOING SO WILL EXPAND THE POOL OF AND THEREBY ENSURING A HEALTHY STREAM OR PIPELINE. OF DIVERSE FACULTY INTO LOTTERING POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE UC CAMPUSES. IN ADDITION OUR COMMITTEE IS ALSO AFFECTING LONG TERM CHANGE WITH RECOMMENDATIONS TO REQUIRE SYSTEM WHY ADOPTION. OF BOTH THE FACULTY EQUITY ADVISER PROGRAM. AND THE SUBMISSION OF CONTRIBUTION TO DIVERSITY STATEMENTS BY ALL APPLICANTS FOR FACULTY POSITIONS. THE FACULTY EQUITY ADVISER PROGRAM INSURERS THAT DIVERSITY IN EQUITY ARE CONSIDERED THROUGHOUT THE HIRING PROCESS AND BEYOND. THE USE OF CONTRIBUTION TO DIVERSITY STATEMENTS INSURERS THAT ALL FACULTY CANDIDATES AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION HAVE A CLEAR PLAN TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD DIVERSITY WHETHER IT IS IN RESEARCH IN SERVICE OR IN TEACHING. IN FACT YOU CANNOT HOPES TO SEE THE ADMINISTRATION INTEGRATE THE USE OF THE STATEMENTS BEYOND THE APPLICATION STAGE AND INTO THE REGULAR FACULTY REVIEW PROCESS. BY ALTERING INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE BOTH INITIATIVES AIM TO MAKE LONG TERM CHANGE. FURTHER MORE BY RAISING CONSCIOUSNESS AND AWARENESS AND HOLDING EVERY FACULTY ACCOUNTABLE TO DIVERSE CITY. THESE INITIATIVES WILL TRANSFORM CULTURAL NORMS AT UC. THESE ARE IMPORTANT TOOLS TO HELP ADVANCE FACT THE DIVERSITY OUT OUT IN A LONG IN THE LONG TERM. FINALLY IF I CAN HIGHLIGHT ONE ADDITIONAL AREA WE'RE SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS CAN YIELD IN DURING RESULTS. IT WOULD BE TO ENSURE THE ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY FACULTY THROUGH THE RANKS AND AT THE VERY SENIOR LEVELS OF THE ACADEMY. TIMELY ADVANCEMENT TO TENURE IS CRITICAL. AND SO IS TIMELY ADVANCEMENT TO FULL PROFESSORSHIP. IT IS AT THE SENIOR LEVEL A FULL PROFESSORSHIP THE FACULTY MEMBERS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS. IT IS ALSO WHEN THEY BECOME ELIGIBLE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF ADMINISTRATION IN THE UNIVERSITY. TO AFFECT LONG TERM CHANGE THEN WE MUST ADVANCE WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY FACULTY TO THE MOST SENIOR LEVELS AND TO CULTIVATE THEM TO BECOME LEADERS THROUGHOUT. THE UNIVERSITY. THE ACADEMIC SENATE IS FULLY COMMITTED TO FACULTY DIVERSITY. WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS. BUT THERE IS STILL MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE. WITH YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT WE WILL MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN FACT WE INSIST ON MAKING TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK -- TO WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN DANA FOR INVITING STANDS TO SPEAK AND FOR TAKING SO MUCH INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE MY NAME'S CAROLYN SIEGEL SAYING I'M A CURRENT THIRD YEAR AT UC SAN DIEGO. ARM SETTING POLITICAL SCIENCE PUBLIC POLICY I AM ALSO JOINED TODAY BY MY GRADUATE COUNTERPART RACHEL ROBERSON A CURRENT GRAD STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY STUDYING EDUCATION POLICY. I'M HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE MY OWN EXPERIENCES AS A UC STUDENT WITH THE ISSUE OF FACULTY DIVERSITY AND HOW IT HAS DEFINED MY UNDERGRAD EXPERIENCE. SO I'LL KEEP IT SHORT I KNOW IT'S LATE. AS A JUNIOR AT UC SAN DIEGO THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SINGLE COURSE I HAVE TAKEN OR I WAS TAUGHT BY FACULTY MEMBER WHO LOOKED LIKE ME. NOT A SINGLE WOMAN OF COLOR HAS BEEN THE INSTRUCTOR OF THE THIRTY OR SO COURSES I'VE TAKEN MY CAMPUS. THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS MY EXPERIENCE IS NOT UNIQUE BY ANY MEANS AND THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S IS KIND OF NORMAL -- DURING THE SEPTEMBER REGION'S MEETING IS ACTUALLY REPORTED THAT UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS MAKE UP TWENTY EIGHT POINT ON PERCENT THE UC WALL LETTERING FACULTY. FROM UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS MAKE UP ONLY 10% -- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY IN A PIPELINE IF NONE OF MY PROFESSORS EVEN LOOK LIKE ME WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO GO TO FOR CAREER ADVICE MENTORSHIP OR RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES -- ANOTHER THING I WANT TO HIT ON IS THAT WHEN YOU DON'T SEE PEOPLE LIKE YOU THE MESSAGE IS VERY CLEAR. YOU'RE NOT BELONG HERE. I COMMEND THE UNIVERSITY FOR ATTEMPTING TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE HOWEVER I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THEY CONTINUE TO WORK ON FACULTY ADVERSITY. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES -- I'M CURRENTLY AFTER BEGINNING OF THE PIPELINE SO I'M HOPING THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO THE ENDS. I WILL NOW DEFERRED SURE RACHEL ROBERSON TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE FROM THE GRADUATE SAN PERSPECTIVE [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON [inaudible] LOCAL. THANK YOU I KNOW OUR NUMBERS HAVE DWINDLED BUT I APPRECIATE YOU ALL STICKING AROUND IT TO HEAR THE REST OF US BE -- I WILL TRY MY BEST TO KEEP THIS BRIEF AS WELL MY NAME IS RACHEL ROBERSON I AM A PHD CANDIDATE AT UC BERKELEY SETTING EDUCATION POLICY. WITH A SPECIALIZATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION -- I WILL NOT BORE YOU ALL WITH A DESCRIPTION OF MY PENDING DISSERTATION ON MY WILL SAVE THAT -- FOR A LATER DATE -- BUT I'LL LIKE TO START JUST BY SAYING -- THAT I ALSO IDENTIFIES FIRST GENERATION -- AND TO ME THAT IT HAS VERY MUCH NATALIE SHAPED -- MY MY CAREER TRAJECTORY ACTION FOR THE FIELD MY DROP FOR THE FIELD BUT ALSO -- MY INTENTION TO AS MY COLLEAGUE HAS STATED TRANSFORM THE VERY LANDSCAPE OF EDUCATION THAT WE OPERATE WITHIN -- IF NOT FOR MYSELF -- CERTAINLY -- FOR OTHER FOLKS AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT PIPELINE AND FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT I HOPE END UP BEING FED INTO THAT PIPE AND EVENTUALLY -- NAMELY MY FUTURE CHILDREN AND CERTAINLY MY NIECES AND NEPHEWS -- I WILL SAY THAT IN DECIDING WHERE I WANTED TO RECEIVE MY GRADUATE TRAINING. ON MENTOR SHIP WAS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE FOR ME -- I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING TRAINED BY WOMEN OF COLOR WHO ALSO HAPPENED TO BE LEADERS IN THE FIELD -- AND SETTING THE STAGE FOR WHAT THE EXPECTATION OF THE ACADEMY WITHIN A PUBLIC -- WITHIN PUBLIC EDUCATION IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE -- UNFORTUNATELY MY COLLEAGUES IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS -- CANNOT SAY THE SAME. I'VE SEEN FAR TOO OFTEN IN A VERY SHORT TENURE AT UC BERKELEY -- INDIVIDUALS WHO CAME IN AS RISING STARS WITHIN THE ACADEMY. FIZZLE OUT AND LEAVE THE INSTITUTION SHORT COMING OF DIVERSE FACULTY MENTOR SHIP -- THE UC IS LOSING AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO BUILD NOT ONLY -- THE THE STRENGTH OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION HERE WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD -- ALL BORROWED FROM THE MY ALMA MATER THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN -- IN THEIR THEIR MISSION STATEMENT WHICH IS WHAT STARTS HERE CHANGES THE WORLD AND WHILE. WE CAN TALK A LOT ABOUT. TEXAS BEING A LITTLE TOO BIG FOR THEIR BRITCHES -- I THINK. I THINK IT'S TO OUR BEST INTEREST -- WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT WHAT THAT THOSE WORDS MEAN I'M AND HOW THEY INTERSECT WITH THE TRUE COMMITMENT AND VALUE TO DIVERSITY -- AND WHILE MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN SHAPED VERY MUCH BY STRONG MENTOR SHIP FROM WOMEN OF COLOR -- THE FACT THAT I CANNOT SAY THE SAME FOR MY COLLEAGUES -- IS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING -- IN VERY MUCH -- IMPACTS WHETHER OR NOT I FEEL VALUED -- WITH IN THIS STATE AND SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THIS INSTITUTION AND WHETHER OR NOT I'D LIKE TO STAY HERE. IT DOES NOT STOP -- AT THE GRADUATE LEVEL THOUGH --% AS MY COLLEAGUES STATED -- NOT HAVING A SINGLE -- AS FACULTY MEMBER OF COLOR HIS -- HER WILLINGNESS TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS AND TRULY ENGAGE THAT ONLY WITH OUR CAMPUS COMMUNITY BUT ALSO WITHIN THE LARGER ACADEMY AS WELL -- MY COLLEAGUE JOHN HARPER DOWN AT USC RECENTLY RELEASED A REPORT -- WHICH UNFORTUNATELY PROVIDE SOME SCATHING -- FINDINGS AROUND THE LACK OF RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF BLACK STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY -- BUT NAMELY WITHIN THE UC AND UNFORTUNATELY SPECIFICALLY AT UC BERKELEY -- NOT SEEING BLACK STUDENTS IN MY COURSES THAT I GS I HIGH -- IMPACTS AND SHAPES -- THE NUANCES THAT I SEE WITHIN THE COMPLEXITIES OF EDUCATIONAL EQUITY -- AND JUST HOW FREQUENTLY WE ARE FALLING SHORT THROUGH OUT THE PIPELINE. WHILE -- PIPELINE FUELING STRUCTURES SUCH AS THE UC PRESIDENTIAL POSTDOC THE H. B. C. U. INITIATIVE SERVICE WONDERFUL FIRST STEPS -- WE DEFINITELY NEED MORE. AN UNAPOLOGETIC COMMITMENT TO INVESTING IN FACULTY DIVERSITY CANNOT AND CONTINUE TO TARGET BUILDING AN ACADEMIC PIPELINE BUT CONTINUE ALL THE WAY UP -- THROUGH TENURED A FULL IN LEADERSHIP ROLES. ONLY THEN CAN WE PROVIDE A HOLISTIC WELL RESOURCE APPROACH THAT CAN ENABLE US AS A COLLECTIVE CALIFORNIA TO TRULY LEAD THE WAY. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. WHAT LIKE TO FOLLOW UP JUST A LITTLE BIT AND QUICKLY -- IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND YOUR SPECIFICALLY IN HIGHER EDUCATION. AT CAL -- HOW MANY DOCTORAL? STUDENTS IN THE DEPARTMENT ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN. IF YOU YOU. MIGHT KNOW. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CORRECT OR MAYBE PHD STUDENTS. THE OUR GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION IT HAS. THERE ARE FIFTEEN OF US. FIFTEEN AFRICAN AMERICAN PHD STUDENTS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ACCOUNT AND HOW MANY ARE WOMEN. THERE ARE EIGHT OF US. AND OF THE FACULTY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- YOU YOU MENTION AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN. DETAIL AT ADDED IT IN HER NUMBER.

THERE ARE TWO OTHERS -- ONE IS EVERYTHING HIGHER THAT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SITTING ON HER AND HER HIRING COMMITTEE AND MIGHT YOU KNOW OF LATINO FACULTY. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CAN YOU GIVE ANY IDEA. HOW MANY I CAN SAY THAT THE THE NUMBER IS -- SIMILAR OF AS WELL AS WITH IT THE DEMOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN OF AND OF GENDER IDENTITY AS WELL AND FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE HAVING. AFRICAN AMERICAN PROFESSORS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT. AS A PHD STUDENT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. 1100% I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE REASON WHY I LEFT THE STATE OF TEXAS AND THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH MY ACADEMIC ADVISER -- NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF AGAIN HER BEING A LEADER IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION IN THE CONVERSATIONS OF EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. BUT SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I WANT THAT BEING TRAINED BY A FELLOW BLACK WOMAN -- ENTERING INTO A FIELD THAT WAS NOT ONLY DOMINATED -- BY WHITE MEN BUT AN INSTITUTION THAT WAS DOMINATED BY WHITE MEN AND AND WHO'S YOUR FACULTY PHD ADVISER CHEN ELSE GOT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I I I I WAS ALSO A GRADUATE STUDENT I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT OF HISTORY AT UC RIVERSIDE. OR GOT MY MASTERS AND AND I SHARE WITH YOU OF THE DIFFERENCE THAT HAVING OF FACULTY OF COLOR MAKES. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'LL GO ON AND TO PUBLIC COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. IS. AND I KNOW I KNOW WE'RE WAY BEHIND TIME. BUT BUT I THINK THAT SOMETIMES THE PUBLIC COMMENT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. AND I AND I SEE MANY OF YOU WHO SAT THROUGH THE WHOLE -- HEARING. AND I VERY MUCH WANT TO HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC SO IF YOU WOULD COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE. I BELIEVE RIGHT HERE TO THE RIGHT. AND I DO WANT TO HEAR FROM EVERYONE. UP BUT WE DO HAVE A LIMIT OF TWO MINUTES -- PER SPEAKER. OKAY ON YOUR MIND AND I AND I HAVE MY YOUR TIMER TIMER HERE OKAY ALL CARRY. A LOT OF NOTES OKAY I'M I'M NOT THAT YEAH DEEP SO SIMON ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HEARD IN THIS HEARING. SO -- I AM IN CHICANO CHICANA STUDIES I'M NOT IN THE STEM FIELDS. AND WE SERVE THE MAJORITY OF THE CHICANO CHICANA LATINA LATINO STUDENTS AT UC DAVIS WE HAVE FROM THOSE OF FIVE HUNDRED UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AT UC DAVIS. 70% OF MY STUDENTS ARE FIRST GENERATION 20% OF THEM ARE FINANCIALLY IN SECURE 12% OF THEM ARE HOUSE IN SECURE -- MANY OF THEIR PARENTS ARE OR MANY OF THEM ARE FROM MAKE STATUS SO -- ONE OF THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS MIGHT NOT BE DOCUMENTED OR THEM THOSE ARE. OR A SOME OF THEIR HOUSES HAVE BEING REPROCESSED THESE ARE THE STORIES THAT OUR STUDENTS SHARE WITH US SO WE HELP THEM NAVIGATE THROUGH THIS -- OUT WHEN I ARRIVE TO THE UNIVERSITY IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WHEN I WAS SAID DAVE IS DOWNTOWN I WAS HOUSE WHERE DO YOU WORK AND I SAID I UC DAVIS. AND I WAS ASKED BECAUSE I AM A LATINA QUITE BUILDING TO WHAT BUILDING DO THE FIRST ASSUMPTION WAS THAT A PERSON WHO LOOKED LIKE ME HOW TO BE A CUSTODIAN -- OR I WAS ASKED BECAUSE I HAVE DOGS ARE YOU A DOG WALKER. THIS ARE THE MICRO AGGRESSIONS THAT A PERSON LIKE ME WHO LOOKS LIKE ME AND COUNTER SO EVERY DAY MY STUDENTS ALSO ENCOUNTERED THEM. UP POLICE HARASSMENT -- OR WE HAD AT MOROCCO HOLE UP MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN SIGN POSTED THERE AND THIS IS THE HOUSE OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES THANK YOU. I'M GOING TO STOP YOU THERE TWO MINUTES THANK YOU AND IF YOU WOULD PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF YES MY NAME IS FRANCISCO NON THIS I'M A RETIRED VICE CHANCELLOR FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF OF CALIFORNIA. MY ENGAGEMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STARTED A FIFTY FIFTY YEARS AGO WHEN I KNOW THAT DURING THAT TIME YOU SEE HAS BEEN CONTROLLED CRITICIZED AND SOMETIMES ATTACKED FOR THE FACT THAT IT DOES NOT -- HAVE ENOUGH LATINOS AND LATINAS REPRESENTED AT THE FACULTY AND ARE ADMINISTRATIVE LEVELS. FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS REPORTS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN HEARINGS HAVE BEEN HELD PROBLEMS IS HAVE BEEN MADE. AND GOALS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND THOSE GOALS AND PROMISES HAVE NOT BEEN MET. HEY YOU SEE I WAS A STUDENT. ALARM OF BERKELEY A LECTURE OF STAFF TO VICE CHANCELLORS AND CHANCELLORS AND MOST RECENTLY A A DOT A DONOR. I WANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN YOU SEE WANTS TO DO SOMETHING. IT CAN. THEY TOOK THREE CAMPUSES THAT WERE THAT WERE YOUNG AND MADE THEM INTO A WORLD CLASS UNIVERSITY SAYS WITNESSED BY IRVINE SANTA CRUZ AND THE SAN DIEGO CAMPUS. IT ALSO TOOK. I AND CREATED A BRAND NEW CAMPUS FROM NOTHING AS WITNESSED BY YOU SEE MERCED. WHEN YOU SEE WANTS TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING IT CAN ADD DOES AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS WHEN YOU SEE ESTABLISHES GOALS THAT HE WANTS TO MEET IT CAN WHEN YOU SEE WANTS TO ACQUIRE FUNDS WHEN FOR NEW ENDEAVORS IT DOES? WHEN YOU SEE WANTS TO IT DOES? THAT BEGS THE QUESTION WHY SEE OF CALIFORNIA NOT HAVE THE REPRESENTATION OF CHICANOS AND CHECK ON US AMONG ITS FACULTY. AND IN -- HIGHER ADMINISTRATION. I BELIEVE THAT THAT LACK OF ROOM REPRESENTATION IS NOT FROM MALICE AFORETHOUGHT BUT RATHER THAT THE SIMPLE FACT THE PUTTING US IN POSITIONS OF INFLUENCE. IS JUST NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH NOT ENOUGH OF A PRIORITY NOT CRUCIAL TO THE UNIVERSITY'S INTERNATIONAL STANDING NOR DEPENDENT FOR FUTURE GROWTH WHEN STAFFING PLANS ARE MADE OR HIRING DECISIONS ARE MADE INCLUDING US. IS JUST NOT A MAJOR FACTOR I KNOW I WAS THERE. YOU SEE LEADERSHIP. FACES THE DILEMMA OF HAVING A STATED GOAL NOT MATCHED BY THE DESIRE WITHIN ITS RANKS TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. I ASK WHAT DETRIMENTAL ACTION HAS BEEN IT HAS BEEN AFFECTED. OF YOU SEE BECAUSE IT HAS NOT MET ITS OWN STATED GOALS. WHAT HAS OCCURRED WITHIN YOU SEE BECAUSE IT HAS NOT MET ITS OWN STATED GOALS THE ANSWER IS VERY LITTLE I KNOW I WAS THERE? I HAVE THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THAT I HAVE WITNESSED FROM THE INSIDE. I HAVE WATCHED YOU SEE FOR MANY YEARS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS AND MEET IMPROBABLE GOALS. WE AT THE UC SYSTEM DO NOT WANT FOR INNOVATIVE THINKING OR QUALITY ADMINISTRATION. THE FAILURE TO PLACE LET THE NASCENT LATINOS INTO ADMINISTRATIVE IN FACT THE RANKS IS A LACK OF COMMITMENT NOT CAPACITY. IF WE CAN'T DO IT IS NOT BECAUSE IT'S HARD BUT WE CAN BECAUSE WE YOU SEE JUST DO NOT CARE ENOUGH. MY MASTER MY PAST EXPERIENCE LEAD ME TO PROTECT THAT IN ANOTHER TEN YEARS FROM NOW ANOTHER GROUP LIKE THIS WILL MEET AS WE ARE TODAY. AND HERE SIMILAR CONCERNS LAMENTS REASONS EXCUSES PLUS MORE GOALS AND PLANS ALL COMBINE TO REFLECT ON SIXTY YEARS OF UC'S LATIN X. PROBLEM. THANK YOU. TIME IS UP THANK YOU.

AND UCBERKELEY WERE EIGHT OF THE TEN UNIVERSITIES USE UNIVERSITIES WERE IN ATTENDANCE WE HAD ASKED THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TO BE PRESENT. EVEN THOUGH WE WERE ONLY A COUPLE MILES AWAY THERE WAS NO ONE PRESENT. SO WE THINK THEY NEED TO BE PRESENT. THEY NEED TO REACH OUT ALSO -- WITH REGARD TO JUST LEADERSHIP WE DON'T SEE OUR LEADERS.

WHEN IS THAT IS -- JOSE MAYOR M. WHICH AS IT SS AGAIN FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND ALSO FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA -- I'M MY NAME'S LOOK BACK IDEA GOES THE S. I'VE BEEN AT UC BERKELEY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS A STAFF AND THIRTY TWO WITH MY GRADUATE YEARS. AND I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THREE THINGS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A STUDENT STAFF NOW AN ADMINISTRATOR. TO ALSO THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR STAFF DEVELOPMENT IN REGARDING TO ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS AND WHAT ARE WE CREATING AROUND THAT BUT NOT ONLY ON SPECIFIC CAMPUSES BUT IT WITHIN THE UC. THE OTHER ONE I ALSO WANT TO MENTION IS TO ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WERE FUNDED BY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT FROM DOCUMENTS STUDENTS SOME SOME OF THOSE FUNDS NOT RE OCCURRING. ON OUR CAMPUS SOMEBODY WENT ON YOUR FIRE BALL WHICH IS ACTUALLY PRODUCING SCHOLARS TO BECOME PH DIS. IS RIGHT NOW WITH -- THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT NOT REFUNDING LIFTED BOTH NOT ON OUR CAMPUS BUT ACROSS THE CAMPUS SPECIFICALLY THOSE WHO ARE ACTUALLY PRODUCING PHD RESEARCH STUDENTS OF COLOR PARTICULARLY LATINOS AND IN THE STEM. AND THE LAST ONE IS ALSO TO THINK ABOUT AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THESE KIND OF RETHINKING RESHAPING RE INSTITUTIONALIZING YOUR AND CREATING TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE IS ALSO TO THINK ABOUT THE CLASS ISSUES IN REGARDS TO ACCESS -- SOME OF THE IMPACTS THAT ARE HAPPENING ACROSS ACADEMIC CHANGES WITH THE CALENDAR AND THE IMPACTS FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO CAN'T HAVE ACCESS PARTICULARLY AROUND. ORIENTATIONS WHEN OUR DURING THE WEEK VERSES ON THE WEEKENDS AND WE'VE BEEN BRINGING THESE ISSUES UP AND I JUST WANTED TO PUT THOSE OUT THERE FOR TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR THIS AGAIN. THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN CAROLINE COULD BE IS -- THANK YOU FOR ASKING THE QUESTION OF HOW LONG AND WHAT IT WILL TAKE -- TO FAIRLY OPEN THE DOORS OF YOU SEE TO WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS ISN'T A HEARING ON FACULTY UNDER REPRESENTATION HOWEVER I WANT TO GIVE YOU A VERY RECENT EXAMPLE OF INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES THAT MUST BE CHANGED IF REAL PROGRESS IS TO BE MADE IN THE UC SYSTEM. A RECENT ASSOCIATE VICE CHANCELLOR POSITION WAS FILLED WITH A WHITE MALE AND A LATINO CANDIDATE WAS NOT GIVEN CONSIDERATION. THE POSITION PAYS AROUND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR. IT REPORTS TO THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO REPORTS THE CHANCELLOR THAT'S A FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT YOU WOULD THINK -- I WAS TOLD THAT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE POSITION AT THIS VERY HIGH LEVEL WAS A TECHNICAL GROUNDING NOT MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE. YOU CAN SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING TO LEAD YOU HAVE TO HAVE BEEN A BABY TO BE HIRED AND WORKED FORTY YEARS TO EVER POSSIBLY REACH THAT EXECUTIVE LEVEL MANAGEMENT POSITION. MOREOVER THIS REQUIREMENT APPEARS ARBITRARY AND PROBABLY HAS NOT BEEN VALIDATED AS AN HR BEST PRACTICE. YOU SEE MUST BE DIRECTED TO ADDRESS IT INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES SUCH AS THIS DIRECTLY IF CHANGES EVER TO BE MADE IN THE UC SYSTEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HEARING FROM MAY ARTHUR HERNANDEZ I'M A REGISTERED NURSE AND THE FAMILY NURSE PRACTITIONER. ALSO THE ELEVENTH IN A FAMILY FIFTEEN FORMER MIGRANT FARM WORKERS I AM -- UC DAVIS GRADUATE ALSO GRADUATE THE CSU SYSTEM AND THE CLERK -- COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM HOW AFTER FRANCISCO NODS HIS POINT HERE LEGISLATE CONTINUE HE LEFT OFF WE'RE REFLECTING ON TEN ADDITIONAL YEARS OF THE UC DIS LET NEXT. A SITUATION AND MAYBE AND IT LOOKING FORWARD HE SAID I LOOKED TO MY ESTEEM UC COLLEAGUES TO PROVE MY PREDICTION WRONG THE NEXT TEST FOR YOU SEE WILL BE THE CHANCELLOR BACK VACANCY UC SANTA CRUZ. A HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION WITH A LATIN ACCEPT MOMENT EXCEEDING 35% I LOOK TO MY UC COLLEAGUES TO TAKE BOLD AND DECISIVE ACTION TODAY. THAT WILL LAUNCH A MAJOR CHANGE EFFORT ON BEHALF OF LATIN COMMUNITY AND I WOULD THEIR SAID THE CALIFORNIA. COMMUNITY NOT JUST THAT I THINK WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER RIGHT -- SO THAT IN TEN YEARS OTHERS WILL LOOK BACK ON THIS MEETING IS A TURNING POINT EACH OF US CAN SAY EACH OF YOU CAN SAY. AND RESPOND I KNOW I WAS THERE I WOULD SAY AND I WOULD SAY FOR MYSELF -- I'VE BEEN AT UC DAVIS HEALTH FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS SEVENTEEN YEARS AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU -- I'M PROUD TO BE AN AGGIE I'M PROUD TO SEE THE CHANGES HAPPENING ARE BUT THEY'RE NOT HAPPENING QUICKLY ENOUGH. BECAUSE I LOOK BACK AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF INACTION HAS LED I BELIEVE HOURS GOVERNMENT SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. TO TEETER AT TIMES AND WE'RE NOW FACING SOME OF THE SAME FIGHTS THAT WE FOUGHT FIFTY YEARS AGO. IN A DIFFERENT WAY NEW WAYS BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME BOLD COURAGEOUS ACTION ON THE PART OF LEADERSHIP. AT ALL LEVELS AND I WOULD SAY THAT INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE MATTERS. EVERYWHERE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE NEED. TO PROMOTE. PEOPLE WHO WERE BORN AND RAISED IN CALIFORNIA GOT THEIR PH DIS IN CALIFORNIA. RIGHT AS WELL AS OTHER PLACES BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REFLECT OUR LEADERSHIP TO ASK OUR LEADERSHIP TO BE PERSISTENT AND CONSISTENT. IN MESSAGING THE NEED FOR DIVERSITY [inaudible] THANK YOU. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. AYE AYE I WANNA SAY THAT -- THE TIMER EURO WAS NOT AN INDICATION OF WHO OR WHAT I AGREE WITH AS A MATTER OF FACT -- THERE IS MUCH SAID IN THIS HEARING -- AND AND AND I THINK THE MOST OF THE FOLKS IN THIS ROOM TODAY AT THIS HEARING. AGREE AND I AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT THAT I HEARD HERE IN IN -- PUBLIC STATEMENT THAT I ALSO HEARD TWO YEARS AGO AT SAN JOSE STATE AND I THINK IT IS WORTH REPEATING MY REPEATED -- BUT MAYBE. FIRST A SHORT STORY. THIS WEEKEND UC RIVERSIDE GAVE ITS ALUMNI METAL. TWO CHARLES YOUNG. CHANCELLOR CHARLES YOUNG OF UCLA WHO. MYSELF INCLUDED PROBABLY. MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HE WAS A GRADUATE OF UC RIVERSIDE. MATTER FACT HE WAS THE FIRST STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT AT UC RIVERSIDE. BELIEVE IT WAS NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YOU SEE FIRSTHAND BODY PRESIDENT CHARLES E. YOUNG. THEN PROFESSOR THEN CHANCELLOR AT UC RIVERSIDE. AND HIS CHANCE -- YOUNG SPOKE AT YOU RECEIVING HIS METAL. DISTINGUISHED ALUMNI HE MENTIONED THAT THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT HE AS CHANCELLOR. WAS PROUD OF WAS HOW HIS EFFORT TO DIVERSIFY THE STUDENT BODY AT UCLA. FROM THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES ON AND I AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT THEN THAT I HEARD HERE THAT I ALSO HEARD. AT SAN JOSE STATE TWO YEARS AGO AND THAT STATEMENT CAME FROM THEN FACULTY AT UC BERKELEY -- AFRICAN AMERICAN A BELIEVE ASTRONOMER WHO SAID. WHAT I HEARD HERE AND PUBLIC'S THAT STATEMENT THAT UC CAN DO? WHAT IT WANTS TO DO? THAT IT HAS THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. I AGREE WITH BOTH OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO SAID THAT. AT SAN JOSE STATE AND SAID IT HERE. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IT IS A COMMITMENT NOT ONLY. AND HERE YOU KNOW I I I I AGAIN MY SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATION. AS AT AGE SIXTY FIVE HEARING IS NOT ENOUGH FOR ME. I CAN NO LONGER JUST LISTEN TO GOOD. WILL. OR EVEN ATTEMPTS. I DO LIKE MY A COLLIE KEVIN MCCARTY WANT TO SEE RESULTS. WANT TO SEE RESULTS BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANNA BE BACK HERE. TEN YEARS FROM NOW TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW HAVING THE SAME DISCUSSION -- UC RIVERSIDE IS ALSO BEEN THE HOME TO THE ONLY TWO LATINO CHANCELLORS. IN THE UC SYSTEM IN ITS HISTORY FIRST. THE MASS RIVERA. WHO WAS CHANCELLOR WHEN I GOT MY MASTERS IN? NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHTY FOUR EIGHT UC RIVERSIDE. AND THEN [inaudible] OF COURSE. FRANCE'S CORDOVA WHO CAME LATER TO LATINO CHANCELLORS IN THE HISTORY OF YOU SEE. THE LAST BEING THE FIRST FRANCES CORDOVA BEING THE SECOND. THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY MOVING FORWARD. TO HAVE. A THIRD CHANCER THERE IS NONE OF THE TEN CAMPUSES IS THERE A LET THE NO. CHANCE FOR AT THIS TIME I THINK THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY AT UC SANTA CRUZ. AND TO ME IT WOULD BE. IT IS NOT ALL. IT IS CERTAINLY NOT ALL AND THIS WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM OR NEITHER IS IT IMPORTANT JUST TO HAVE. FIGURES BUT IT IS TO ME UNACCEPTABLE. THAT OUT OF TEN CHANCELLOR'S AS I GO TO THE REGENTS MEETING THERE IS NOT ONE CHANCELLOR THERE WHO COMES FROM THE LATINO COMMUNITY. I THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY I HOPE IT'S BEEN VALUABLE AND I HOPE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THESE DISCUSSIONS. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. ROGER
