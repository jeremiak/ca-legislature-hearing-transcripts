SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING OF THE. EDUCATION FINANCE. SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THE BUDGET WILL START WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE. THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING AS WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM TO DO THE VOTE ONLY ITEMS SO. WE HAVE THE CTC FOLKS COMMAND. THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER ONE. THE GOVERNOR'S CTC BUDGET PROPOSALS. INCLUDING. THE MORNING GOOD MORNING. WAYS I GUESS THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MEMBERS IT'S. GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING. SO I'M JUST GOING TO START BY WITH A QUICK REMINDER OF THE CDC THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING IS A SPECIAL FUNDACION SEE. WE HAVE THREE CORE FUNCTIONS THE FIRST IS A SET STANDARDS. BUT THE PREPARATION OF THE EDUCATION WORKFORCE AND ISSUE CREDENTIALS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO EARN THEM. A SECOND BUT USE THE PROCESSING OF COASTED OVER TO IT AND FIFTY THOUSAND DIFFERENT CREDENTIAL DOCUMENTS EVERY YEAR. THIRD IS TO OPERATE A TEACHER DISCIPLINE SYSTEM FOR ANY EDUCATOR WHO SAID. RECOMMENDED TO US FOR REVIEW BASED ON MISCONDUCT. AYE WE'RE OVERSEEN BY A NINETEEN MEMBER COMMISSION OF THE TO MEET SIX TIMES A YEAR. FOLLOWING SEVERAL YEARS OF DECLINE HAN CREDENTIALS MEMBERS AND AND REVENUES WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ADAPTEC AND THAT HAS BEEN HEALTHY FOR THE AGENCY AND ITS BUDGET. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE DONE SOME MAJOR HOW PROJECTS WE'VE OVER HOLDER ACCREDITATION SYSTEM WEARING IT FROM A PAPER BASED. SYSTEM FOCUSED ON COMPLIANCE TO A PERFORMANCE BASED SYSTEM WHERE WE LOOK AT A NUMBER. QUALITY INDICATORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER PREPARATION IS HITTING THE MARK. WE'VE BUILT A TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OR REBUILD IF YOU WILL THE COMMISSION'S TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT HAND BUILT. OUR FIRST ADMINISTRATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS BOTH OF THOSE SYSTEMS ARE READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION THIS FALL ON THAT'S BEEN A VERY EXCITING SET OF REFORMS. THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAVE GIVE US FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO DO THAT WORK TOOK US TWO YEARS TO COMPLETE THAT DEVELOPMENT AND GET THEM READY. COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED THAT FOR THE ADMINISTRATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT BASED ON HOW COMPLEX THAT SYSTEM IS AND HOW NEW IT IS FOR ADMINISTRATOR PREPARATION. THAT NEXT YEAR WOULD BE A NON CONSEQUENTIAL YEAR FOR A CANDIDATE SO THEY WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE IT. THEIR PREPARATION PROGRAMS THAT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO AKE SURE IT'S FULLY INSTALLED BEFORE WE BEGIN COUNTING THE SCORES FOR A LICENSE IN NINETEEN TWENTY. ABOUT THE SYSTEM ITSELF WILL BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT NEXT YEAR. OUR CREDENTIAL APPLICATIONS ARE UP. THANKFULLY WE'VE SEEN SEVEN AND THREE PERCENT INCREASES OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS EXPECT THAT THIS YEAR WILL SEE SOMETHING IN THAT RANGE AS WELL. OR DISCIPLINE CASES ARE ALSO UP BY ABOUT TEN PERCENT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. ON THAT THOSE THINGS FOLLOWING PARALLEL HAS POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS GO UPSET OR DISCIPLINE CASES. WE ARE ALSO WORKING HARD TO ASSIST THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS THEY BRING DOWN A BACKLOG OF CASES THAT HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO THEM OF FOR APPEAL. NETWORK IS BEGINNING TO ALSO SHOW SOME PROGRESS SO THAT'S A QUICK OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE ARE AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THE LAST FEW YEARS OF LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO FINANCE TO TALK ABOUT. THE PROPOSALS FOR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. I THINK. THANK YOU. THAT MORNING KIMBERLY LEAHY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TEACHER CREDENTIALS FUND. ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TEST DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNT FUNDS AND THREE HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS REIMBURSEMENT FOR A TOTAL OPERATING BUDGET OF JUST OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE COMMISSION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THIS FUNDING SUPPORTS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE AUTHORIZED POSITIONS. IN ADDITION ONE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. GENERAL FUND IS INCLUDED FOR TWO NEW TEACHER WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS WHICH WILL BE COVERED IN GREATER DETAIL LATER. FOR THE COMMISSION STATE OPERATIONS BUDGET THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ONE TIME TEACHERS CREDIT TEACHER CREDENTIALS FUND. TO CONVERT MICROFICHE CREDENTIAL RECORDS TO A DIGITAL FORMAT. THE MICROFICHE CREDENTIAL RECORDS INCLUDE ALL CREDENTIALS ISSUED PRIOR TO NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND LIFETIME CREDENTIALS WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE RENEWAL. THIS CONVERSION WOULD PROVIDE THE COMMISSION AND EASY TO SEARCH DIGITAL REPOSITORY OF ALL CREDENTIAL RECORDS AND ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO RETIRE THE EXISTING OUTDATED. MICROFICHE SYSTEM. ONE POINT THREE MILLION ONE TIME TEST DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION SUSAN ACCOUNT TO CONDUCT A FULL FIELD ADMINISTRATION OF THE NEWLY DEVELOPED CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT. WHICH WILL BE NON CONSEQUENTIAL FOR TEST TAKERS. THIS NON CONSEQUENTIAL ADMINISTRATION WILL ALLOW PREPARATION PROGRAMS TO VERIFY THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE LYING TO THE NEW ASSESSMENT. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WOULD ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO ACCURATELY AND RELIABLY SET THE ASSESSMENTS PASSING SCORES WITHOUT IMPOSING NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ON THE TEST TAKERS. THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ONE TIME TEACHER'S CREDENTIAL FUND IS PROVIDED TO AUTOMATE TEACHER MRS SIMON MONITORING. THE COMMISSION BEGAN MONITORING TEACHER MRS SIMONS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. THE ACTIVITY IS PAPER DEPENDENT AND VERY LABOR INTENSIVE FOR BOTH THE COMMISSION AND LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. THE NEW THE NEW PROCESS WOULD BE BASED ON A DATA MATCH OF WORSE AND TEACHER ASSIGNMENT DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WITH CREDENTIAL DATA FROM THE COMMISSION TO PRODUCE A DIGITAL DATA SET OF MISS ASSIGNMENTS. LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WOULD THEN BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS TO EXCUSE ME TO ACCESS. THE DATA SET TO VERIFY. THE A MISS ASSIGNMENTS WHETHER THEY ARE CORRECT OR TWO. PROVIDE DATA AS TO WHY THEY ARE APPROPRIATELY ASSIGN TEACHERS. THE CORRECT DATA SAID WOULD THEN BE USED TO PRODUCE A REPORT FOR THE LEGISLATURE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROVIDES TWO POSITIONS AND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS TEACHER CREDENTIALS FUND. SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE TICKER TEACHER WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS THE CURRENT YEAR AND THOSE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. OF THIS AMOUNT ONE HUNDRED IS AVAILABLE TWO YEARS TO SUPPORT TEMPORARY HEALTH. IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION THROUGH A SPRING FINANCE LETTER REQUEST THAT THE COMMISSION'S REIMBURSEMENTS BE INCREASED BY ONE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A GRANT. FROM THE SAN DIEGO. FROM DISNEY STATE SAN DIEGO UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION TO CONVENE FIELD EXPERTS TO REVIEW THE OUTCOMES OF THE CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATOR. LAUP AND JENNIFER KUHN LET'S ANALYST'S OFFICE SAID BUT TO BE ASSESSED DID YOU WANT TO. TALK ABOUT THE STATE OUTSIDE OF THE OVERALL TEACHERS PROPOSALS RIGHT X. WE KIND OF ARE BLENDING THE TWO TOGETHER. I I WAS GOING TO I THINK FINANCE JUST EXPLAINED ALL OF THE PROPOSALS BEFORE C. T. FEED I WAS GOING TO HIGHLIGHT OUR REACTIONS TO THE THREE THAT ARE ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA PERFECT AND THEN JUST TALK AT THE AND ABOUT TEACHER MISCONDUCT CASES WHAT DO. SO THROUGH AFFORD TO START OF OBLIQUELY AND SO I WAS STUDENT TAKE THEM IN THE ORDER THEY APPEAR HERE IN YOUR AGENDA SO ON THE FIRST ISSUE THAT'S RELATED. TO AUTOMATING THE TEACHER MONITORING ACTIVITIES WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WE DID EXAMINE WHETHER THE STATE COULD DO IT THROUGH EXISTING MEANS OUR DO IT MORE CHEAPLY BUT CONCLUDED THAT IT COULDN'T. THE INFORMATION BEING COLLECTED WE THINK IS IMPORTANT ITS BASIC TEACHER ASSIGNMENT DATA DOES THE TEACHER HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO BE WORKING IN OUR AREA. AND TO BE ABLE TO DO IT AND I AYE A SMALL AMOUNT OF ONE TIME MONEY TO BE ABLE TO AUTOMATE THAT FOR EVERY SCHOOL EVERY YEAR I WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD HELP DISTRICTS UNDERSTAND OF TEACHER SHORTAGES EXIST IF THEY'RE PERSISTING. AND THEN AT LEAST SPUR A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO RESPOND. THE ONE POINT THREE MILLION FOR THAT US ADMINISTRATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT HAVE CONCERNS WITH. SO I'M YOU HEARD THAT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN ACTUALLY THREE YEARS AGO THE STATE PROVIDED TWO MILLION TO DEVELOP THE API. THIS ADMINISTRATOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT AND SEE TO SEE THE LOTS OF GOOD THINGS ABOUT FUNDING THEY WENT OUT AND THEY DEVELOP THE EXAM THEY CONDUCTED FIELD TASKS FOR A HUNDRED AND TEN CANDIDATES AND SIX AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY CANDIDATES AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AGAIN THE TEST WAS ORIGINALLY UNDER THE ORIGINAL BUDGET REQUEST TO BE DEVELOPED AT THE END OF SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BUT THEY WENT AHEAD AND DID A SECOND FIELDS HIGHEST. IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. THEY ALSO USE A PORTION OF THE MONEY TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS YOU HAVE TO ADMINISTER THE TUSTIN TO SUPPORT TRAININGOF THOSE WHO SCORED THE TOSS. SO WE'RE CONCERNED THAT NOW THE REQUEST IS FOR ONE POINT THREE MILLION TO DO ANOTHER FIELD TASK BUT THIS FIELD TESTS WOULD BE OF EVERY CANADA. AND SO TYPICALLY WE DON'T DO THREE FEEL TASKS AND WE DON'T DO A FIELD TEST FOR EVERY CANDIDATE WHO'S TAKING ON. SO BEFORE YOU A SORT OF JUST AND BUT BEFORE YOU REALLY NEED TO DECIDE ON THIS WE WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT. DID YOU SEE PROVIDER A CLEARER EXPLANATION FOR WHY AN ADDITIONAL YEAR IS NEEDED WHEN IT COMES TO TRAINING OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE EXAM THE FAB FIVE YEARS NOW TO AT LEAST BE FAMILIAR THAT IT'S COMING. THEY'VE ALL EVERY TRAINING PROGRAM HAS BEEN THROUGH AT LEAST ONE TRAINING. OUT SECTION TO LEARN WHAT THE EXAM IS ALL ABOUT HOW TO ADMINISTER IT. ON THE THIRD ISSUE THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR THAT POTENTIAL RECORDS JUST I'M MOMENTS OF BACKGROUND SO STARTING IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE CTC STARTED DIGITIZING ANY NEWER CREDENTIAL APPLICATION SO THE STATE HAS DIGITAL RECORDS FOR EVERY TEACHER HIS MINUTE APPLICATIONS FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. ON. FOR THOSE TEACHER RECORDS THAT ARE BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THEY HAVE MOST OF THE RECORDS ON MICROFICHE WHICH WE ALL UNDERSTAND IS OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY IN SOME CASES THEY HAVE THEM ON PAPER. THE MOST OF THESE TEACHERS HAVE RETIRED IF THEY HOVER RETIRED THEY WILL SHORTLY HEAR. I'M SO SPENDING ONE AND A HALF MILLION TO TAKE OLD RECORDS AND TO DIGITIZE THEM OUT WE CONCLUDED WAS JUST ARE NOT COST EFFECTIVE SO WE DID ANALYSIS OF HOW MANY REQUESTS THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW TO GO BACK WITH THESE. OLDER RECORDS MAKE IT ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED A YEAR. WHICH OUT OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TEACHERS AS A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF REQUESTS. AND WE THINK AGAIN THAT THOSE WILL GO DOWN BUT WE JUST RAN AN ESTIMATE WHAT IF THEY WERE TO GET SOMETHING LIKE FOUR HUNDRED REQUESTS A YEAR FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS AND TELL THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE RETIRED NO LONGER LIVING CLEARLY OUT OF THE PROFESSION. AND THAT ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER RECORD TO DIGITIZE A WHICH IS ABOUT TEN TIMES MORE THAN THEY SPEND RITE NOW JUST GOING TO THE RECORD LOOKING AT IT AND ANSWERING THE QUESTION. SO WE THINK THAT COULD JUST KEEP STORING THEM ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AS THEY ARISE AND IN A FEW YEARS THEY CAN START RESPONSE AND WHAT THE RECORDS OUT EXCESS THAT ARE NO LONGER NEEDED. THE LAST ISSUE BEFORE YOU HAS IS NOT A SPECIFIC EIGHTEEN NINETEEN REQUEST BUT DEALS WITH AN ONGOING ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE REGARDING THE STATE PROCESSING OF TEACHER MISCONDUCT CASES. IN TWENTY ELEVEN. THERE WAS CONCERN REYES WITH THE PROCESSING OF THESE CASES THERE WAS A LARGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CASES SUBMITTED FROM THE FIELD TO CTC. AND THEN BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED IN OUR ACTUAL CASES THERE WERE AS AN INCREASE IN THOSE CASES THAT WERE APPEALED. SO WHEN CTC MAKES A DECISION FOR EXAMPLE TO REVOKE A LICENSE MORE A CASES WERE BEING APPEALED AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE CASE OF SHIFTED TO THE HP. SO. THE LEGISLATURE AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THERE WERE LOTS OF MORE CASES COMING TO THE AGE SHE THE NUMBER OF APPEAL DECISIONS ALMOST TRIPLED FROM ELEVEN TWELVE TO FOURTEEN FIFTEEN GOING FROM SIX HUNDRED CASES APPEALED. TO ALMOST TWO HUNDRED CASES APPEALED TO THE STATE PROVIDED SOME MONEY THEY INCREASE THE CREDENTIAL FEEL THAT EVERY TEACHER PAYS WHEN THE FILER CREDENTIAL FROM SEVENTY DOLLARS TWO HUNDRED. IT WAS ESTIMATED TO GENERATE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND THE FORMALLY WAS EFFECTIVELY GIVEN TO THE AG TO DO MORE PROCESSING OF THESE CREDENTIALS SO THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN. AN EXPEDITED FASHION. HAVING SAID THAT SINCE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE NUMBER OF OPEN CASES OVER THAT AT THE AG HAS INCREASED SO IT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY OPEN CASES AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN IT'S NOW UP TO THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN OPEN CASES AS OF SEPTEMBER TWENTY. SEVENTEEN. SO STE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN CONCERNED NOT ONLY GAVE MORE MONEY BUT STARTED HAVING BOTH CTC AND AG SUMMIT SOME BETTER RECORDS OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING TO LEGISLATURE SO WE HAVE BETTER INFORMATION WITH AG IS DOING. IT GAVE US A REPEAL REPORT JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO FEBRUARY. SO WE KNOW FROM THAT REPORT THAT THE AGING NOW IS DEDICATING MORE STAFF TIME TO PROCESSING THIS CREDENTIALS IT WENT UP TWELVE PERCENT. BUT WE ESTIMATE THAT EVEN WITH AMOUNTS OF PROCESS IN THAT'S OCCURRING RIGHT NOW THE AG WILL USE THREE MILLION OF THE TUNNEL AND THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED FOR. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE BACKLOG HAS GONE DOWN IN THE LAST QUARTER COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS ONE ABOUT TEN PERCENT. BUT PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE SETTLEMENTS HAVE GONE OUT NOTABLY AND ONE OF THE REASONS SETTLEMENTS ARE GOING UP IS BECAUSE AN LJ RECENTLY AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE DECIDED TO DISMISS THE CASE BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE WAS SO OLD. SO WE ALSO KNOW THAT THESE CASES ARE TAKING AN EXTRAORDINARY LONG LEE LONG TIME TO PROCESS SO CTC ON AVERAGE TAKES FOUR HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN DAYS TO PROCESS THE CASE IF IT'S APPEALED IT GOES TO THE AGENCY. AND THEY'RE TAKING SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DAYS. THE PROCESS THE CASE SO IT'S TAKING MORE THAN A THOUGHT I'M SORRY SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE. STICKING MORE THAN A THOUSAND IS TO PROCESS A IT'S ALMOST THREE YEARS. SO WE'VE BEEN SUGGESTING. THIS AS A VERY LONG TIME IN MOST CASES OBVIOUSLY I'M SORRY NOT OBVIOUSLY BUT IN MOST CASES TEACHERS AND ABSTAINED IN THE CLASSROOM Y. THIS STATE REVIEW IS OCCURRING. EVEN IF AND I'LL ADD A LICENSES ULTIMATELY REVOKED. AND FOR THOSE WHO GET TO KEEP THEIR LICENSE THEY'RE STILL INCONVENIENCED BY A PROCESS THAT SEEKING ALMOST THREE YEARS. FOR THEM TO BE PART OF THIS LEGAL PROCESS. SO WE RECOMMEND TO CONTINUE MONITORING IT CAN SEND YOU SEE ENOUGH IMPROVEMENT OCCURS IF IMPROVEMENT DOESN'T OCCUR YOU MIGHT LIKE FUNDAMENTALLY RETHINK HOW THE STATE PROCESSES CASES TO SEE IF THE STATE'S ADDING VALUE. WHAT VALUE COULD EXPEDITE THIS PROCESS? I HAD A MINIMUM YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT IN A STATUTORY TIME FRAME MAYBE RATHER THAN THREE YEARS YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE DONE IN SIX MONTHS. BUT SOMETHING A YEAR FROM NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER. MAYBE JUST IF YOU CAN RESPOND TO THE LAST ONE IS OURS. THAT THE. THE NEED FOR THAT. DIGITIZING. THAT SMALL UMBER OF. RELATIVE SMALL NUMBER OF INCREASE EACH YEAR. WHY THAT'S POINTED SO WE HAVE? WE HAVE ELECTRIFY FOR IN OUR BUILDING THAT IS THE SIZE OF A PROBLEM NINETEEN SEVENTY MAINFRAME COMPUTER COULD TAKE UP A SMALL ROOM BY ITSELF AND THAT'S OUR STORAGE UNIT. FOR ALL OF THE MICROFICHE THAT HAVE ALL OF OUR CREDENTIAL RECORDS ARE ABOUT ONE POINT THREE MILLION RECORDS AND IT. AND. ESSENTIALLY WE THINK THE MOST EFFICIENT THING TO DO WAS TO CREATE A DIGITIZED DATABASE FOR THAT THAT IS. ACCESSIBLE WE'VE HAD EIGHT REQUESTS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS FOR RECORDS THAT AS EARLY AS NINETEEN THIRTY. IT FROM AS A AS A CUSTODIAN IF YOU WILL OF THE PUBLIC RECORD AMONG COMFORTABLE WITH WITH DESTROYING RECORDS RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO KEEP. THEM INTACT AND AND STORED. OF THEY DO DETERIORATE OVER TIME. AND THAT BECOMES A PROBLEM FOR STORAGE AND APPROPRIATE KINDS OF STORAGE IT SEEMS TO JUST MAKE BETTER SENSE TO CREATE ONE RECORD OF DIGITIZED. CREDENTIALS THAT CAN BE SEARCHED AND UTILIZED FOR. FOR THE FUTURE AND THAT'S THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THAT I HOPE I'M ASKING ANSWERING THE QUESTION THAT YOU'VE ASKED MISTER CHAIRMAN. FURTHER QUESTIONS MR MEDINA. LA JOH. DISTRICTS CAN CHOOSE TO NOT HAVE THE TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM IS THAT CORRECT. WHEN WHEN THEY'RE. GET PUT IN THE PROCESS OF. BEING DISCIPLINE. I'M STATE LOOKED LIKE IT'S LIKE I'D LIKE TO I WOULD AYE FASTER GENERAL COUNSEL VANESSA WHITNALL TO JOIN US AT THE TABLE SHE MANAGES THIS WORK FOR THE COMMISSION SO. GOOD MORNING VANESSA WHAT NOW GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE COMMISSION. AND IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION YES DISTRICTS CAN REMOVE A TEACHER FROM THE CLASSROOM. HOWEVER THEY ARE SUBJECT TO EMPLOYMENT LAWS IN TERMS OF HOW TO DO THAT MISSKELLEY PROCESS. THE COMMISSION ON PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE HEARING FIX SATRAPS SO IT DOES TAKE DISTRICTS. A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME TO GO THROUGH THE DISMISSAL PROCESS BUT THEY DO HAVE THE PAID ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE OPTION. SO THAT FUTURE COULD BE NOT IN THE CLASSROOM GOING THROUGH THE DISCIPLINE PROCESS. AND BEING PAID BY THE DISTRICT WHEN. CORRECT CORRECT THE NOT BEING IN THE CLASSROOM CORRECT BUT THE ON THE PAYROLL OF THE OF THE. OF THE DISTRICT. YEAH. AND I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION. AS FAR AS THE. THE REQUEST FOR CREDENTIALS GOING BACK TO NINETEEN THIRTY. WHAT WHY WOULD WHO WOULD ASK FOR THAT? WELL IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. AND THE AND I'M NOT AND I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHO WOULD ASK FOR IT I DID HAVE A COMMISSIONER RECENTLY HOWEVER. MENTION THAT AND THIS IS A COMPLETE ANECDOTE BUT. SHE'S LIVING IN A HOUSE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY. INHABITED BY THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN WHO WAS APPOINTED AS AN ADMINISTRATOR FOR A SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA. SHE WORKS AT A CHARTER SCHOOL AND SHE'S SHE'S THINKING THAT THIS WOULD BE A GREAT HISTORIAN PROJECT FOR STUDENTS AND. THE ABILITY TO COME IN ACCESS THE WOMAN'S CREDENTIAL. IS SOMETHING THAT SHE WAS ASKING ME ABOUT SO THAT WE COULD IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE THERE'S HISTORICAL INTEREST IN AND THERE MAY BE RELATIVES WHO WERE INTERESTED IN THAT YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF THEIR FAMILY AND AND ANY CREDENTIALS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ISSUED. SO THAT INTEREST OF COURSE IS A CONVENIENCE THAT WE PROVIDE IT'S NOT A NECESSITY FOR LICENSURE. BUT WE HAVE SEEN INCREASED. REQUESTS FOR RECORDS THERE WITH BETTER HOUSED IN IN THE LIKE TREAT HER RIGHT NOW IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE A TEACHER SHORTAGE IN THERE'S GREAT RECRUITMENT AND PEOPLE WHO ARE RETIRED YOU CAN COME BACK A SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS ETCETERA. ARE REQUESTING THEIR DOCUMENTS TODAY HAVE THEM UPDATED I'M NOT SURE ANY OF THEM WERE BORN IN NINETEEN THIRTY BUT I WOULDN'T WANT TO MAKE. HUNDRED PERCENT BACK ON THAT. WELL AYE AYE WAS CREDENTIALED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE I THINK I'M. I WILL BE ASKING FOR MY CREDENTIALS ANYMORE IT BUT I WAS A HISTORY TEACHER AND I SEE THE VALUE OF RECORDS IT JUST SEEMS TO ME. THAT IF IT'S GOING TO BE TEN TIMES AS MUCH TO DIGITIZE. THAT I QUESTION THE. THE EXPENDITURE. OKAY THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA HOLD THESE ISSUES OPEN AND PROCEED NOW TO. ISSUE NUMBER TWO THE PROPOSALS ON TEACHER WORKFORCE. AND SUCH AN AFRICAN AGAIN ON THE LEDGE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND THAT WE HAVE. BUT I'LL GO AHEAD AND JUST GET STARTED WAY I'M IS BEING PASSED OUT IT'S CALLED THE DRESS IN THE SPECIAL ED TEACHER SHORTAGE. THE GOVERNOR HAS TO PROPOSALS IN THIS AREA BUT JUST AS A BIT OF CONTEXT THERE'S TWO KINDS OF SPECIAL ED. EMPLOYEES THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS AND SPECIALISTS TO BE A SPECIAL ED TEACHER IN CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SPECIALIZED CREDENTIAL THERE ARE A VARIETY OF TYPES OF CREDENTIALS. YOU ACTUALLY NOT ONLY NEED A SPECIAL AND CREDENTIAL YOU NEED THE RIGHT SPECIALIZED CREDENTIAL TO TEACH THE SPECIFIC KINDS OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES THAT ARE IN YOUR CLASSROOM. AND THEN THERE ARE SPECIALISTS THESE ARE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS SPEECH THERAPISTS PSYCHOLOGIST THAT PROVIDE WRAPAROUND SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS. PAGE TWO OF THE HANDOUT THERE'S BEEN LONG STANDING SHORTAGES BOTH. IN ALL OF THESE SPECIAL IN THESE TWO SPECIAL EDUCATION CATEGORIES IT'S HAPPENED FOR DECADES IT'S HAPPENED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. EVEN WITHIN SPECIAL ED THOUGH THERE ARE MORE ACUTE AREAS SO WITHIN TEACHERS THOSE TEACHERS WHO SERVES STUDENTS WITH MODERATE AND SEVERE DISABILITIES SUCH THE MOST CRITICAL SHORTAGE AREA. AND OF SPECIALISTS OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS AND SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPISTS ARE THE MOST CUTE. AREAS AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS HERE ON PAGE TWO FORTY PERCENT OF THE DO TEACHERS AND A RECENT YARDS AND THAT HAVE THE RIGHT CREDENTIAL FOR SERVING STUDENTS WITH MODERATE AND SEVERE DISABILITIES. ALMOST A QUARTER OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST IN AND HAVE THEM WORK WERE CONTRACTED OUT SO THEY THEY WERE LICENSE BUT THEY HAD TO BE CONTRACTED OUT BY A THIRD PARTY A SCHOOL DISTRICT COULDN'T FIND SOMEBODY TO HIRE ON STAFF. SO WE HAD AN ANALYST IN OUR OFFICE SPANS SEVERAL MONTHS OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR GOING OUT AND TALKING WITH SOAP ADMINISTRATORS AND. DISTRICT ADMINISTRATORS SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS STUDENTS AND ASKING WHY THE SHORTAGE IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE BUT IT HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA IS VERY ACUTE AS HAPPENED FOR DECADES. IF WE DON'T WANT TO SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA FOR SORT OF ONE OF LEAD THE WAY TO GET RID OF THIS IN THE NATION WHAT WHAT IT TAKES TO LET'S UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES OF THE SHORTAGE. AND WHAT WE HEARD MOST FREQUENTLY WAS PAID THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS HAVE CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES LIKE DEVELOPING IEP IS COORDINATING ALL THE SPECIALISTS THAT WORK WITH THE STUDENT. IN SOME CASES RESPONDING TO LITIGATION WHEN PARENTS ARE UPSIDE. AND IN MOST IT DOWN MOST DISTRICTS SPECIAL ED TEACHERS ARE PAID ROUGHLY THE SAME IF NOT THE SAME. VERY DIFFERENT THAN OTHER PROFESSIONS WHERE IN MOST CASES RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMPENSATION ARE LINKED. WE ALSO HEARD THOUGH THAT THERE ARE FEW STATE LEVEL THINGS THAT ARE DIRECTLY EITHER CONTRIBUTING ARE EXACERBATING THE SHORTAGE. IN CALIFORNIA IT TAKES FIVE YEARS TO GET BOTH A TEACHING CREDENTIAL AND A BACHELOR'S DEGREE MANY OTHER STATES ALLOW STUDENTS TO DO THIS ON A MORE EXPEDITED FASHION WHERE THEY GET THE SPECIAL A CREDENTIAL. AND A BACHELOR IN EDUCATION AND FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS. CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS A VERY NARROW CREDENTIALS SO YOU HAVE TO THE RATE CREDENTIAL FOR THE SPECIFIC STUDENTS IN OUR CLASSROOM. AND MANY GRADUATE LEVEL PREPARATION PROGRAMS LIKE AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PROGRAM ARE IMPACTED SO FAR MORE DEMANDS THAN FUNDED SLOTS. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE HEARD MORE ISOLATED STORIES SO IN CERTAIN DISTRICTS THEIR HR DEPARTMENTS JUST WEREN'T WORKING AS THEY SHOULD SO IT WOULD TAKE MAYBE SIX MONTHS TO MAKE A HIGHER AND BY THAT TIME ALL THE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD THE PROPER CREDENTIAL HAD BEEN HIRED BY OTHER DISTRICTS. AND IN SOME CASES THE ONGOING SUPPORT TO FOR THAT PARTICULAR GOD. SO THE GOVERNOR I'M JUST GOING TO GO OVER THIS QUICKLY I THINK FINANCE WILL TALK ABOUT THEM. AT LENGTH BUT FACTOR OR IN MORE DETAIL BUT THERE'S TWO PROPOSALS TOGETHER THEY TOTAL A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BOTH ONE TIME. ONE IS FOR TEACHER RESIDENCY AND ONE IS JUST A DISCRETIONARY LOCAL GRANT YOU COULD APPLY FOR THE FIFTY MILLION GET TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CANDIDATE. AND BE ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO THROUGH A LOCAL PLAN. SO ON PAGE FIVE WE HAVE OUR REACTION TO THOSE TWO PROPOSALS WE THINK IT'S GREAT THAT THE GOVERNOR IS CREATING A CONVERSATION ABOUT SPECIAL ED STAFFING SHORTAGES. I'M IS HELPFUL AYE BUT WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH BOTH THEY'RE BOTH ONE TIME BUT THE KINDS OF THINGS I JUST MENTIONED BY AND LARGE NOT NOT ALL OF THEM BUT MANY ARE ONGOING IN NATURE. DOESN'T ADDRESS COMPENSATION EVEN THOUGH WE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN NOTS THE CORE ISSUE. NEITHER ADDRESSES STATE LEVEL ISSUES LIKE CREDENTIALING AND EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS. NEITHER DRESSES LOOK AT SPECIFIC LOCAL LEVEL ISSUES THAT DISTRICTS THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE HR ISSUES THAT HAVE PROBLEMS PROVIDING HELPFUL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ONGOING SUPPORT. NEITHER DEALS WITH IMPACTION UNCERTAIN SPECIALIST PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS THEY HAVE UNIQUE PROBLEMS WE WOULD SUGGEST THE FIRST US ON TEACHER RESIDENCY IF YOU HAVE A SHORTAGE IT COULD PRODUCE SLIGHTLY MORE BETTER TRAINED COULD PRODUCE BETTER TRAIN TEACHERS BUT NOT NECESSARILY MORE TEACHERS THEY MIGHT BE PRODUCED. JUSTIN ANOTHER AVENUE THROUGH ANOTHER TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM. IT'S ALSO VERY EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE JUST A FEW TEACHERS AND SOME DISTRICTS RD USED OUR LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA TO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR THERE'S ALSO SUBSTANTIAL MONEY GOING AND SALAS YOUR FIVE SUCH THAT IF MORE DISTRICTS WANTED TO DO IT THEY COULD DO IT THERE'S ALSO SUBSTANTIAL MONEY UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON ONE TIME DISCRETIONARY GRANTS IN HIS IS A ONE TIME DISCUSSION ARE PROPOSAL'S OF. DISTRICTS WANTED TO DO MORE RESIDENCY SLOTS FOR SHORT TERM. ON A SHORT TERM BASIS THEY COULD DO THAT. THEN ON THE LOCAL SOLUTIONS GRANT THE KINDS OF ISSUES WE FOUND IN THE FIELD ARE DIFFICULT ISSUES SUCH THAT IF YOU WERE GOING TO GIVE ONE TIME MONEY AT THE STATE LEVEL IT WOULD BE GET IT WOULD BE FOR DISTRICTS TO DO THE DIFFICULT THINGS. BUT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY WANNA DO THEY WANNA BE DIRECTED BY THE STATE TO DO THE DIFFICULT THINGS. SO ON PAGE SIX WE SUGGEST TAKING A DIFFERENT APPROACH REJECTING THE ONE TIME. PLANS AND THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS ON THE TABLE AND. DOING A FEW OTHER THINGS. THE FIRST IS THAT THE STATE COULD REPEAL AND STATE LAW RIGHT NOW IT'S SUCH A DEFAULT SALARY POLICY IN THE DEFAULT IS THAT THERE'S A UNIFORM SALARY SCHEDULE. AND WITH THE STATE COULD REPEAL THIS AND JUST BE SILENT ON THE ISSUE. THIS MEANS THAT DISTRICTS COULD. COLLABORATIVELY WORK WITH THE UNION TO TRY TO EXPLORE MAY BE CREATIVE ANDOUR ORDINARY WAYS TO ADDRESS COMPENSATION FOR SPECIAL ED TEACHERS. THE STATE JUST WANNA BE CREATING A DEFAULT TO DO THE OPPOSITE THAT IT WOULD BE CREATING A LITTLE BIT MORE ROOM FOR FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE DISTRICTS WHO MIGHT WANT TO ENGAGE IN THOSE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT RATHER THAN HAVING TO SPECIAL ED CREDENTIALS MILD MODERATE AND MODERATE SEVERE HAVING ONE. THAT WOULD TRAIN INDIVIDUALS TO DEAL WITH A PANOPLY OF SPECIAL A CHALLENGES THAT MIGHT ARISE IN THE CLASSROOM RECOGNIZING THAT ONCE THIS TEACHER GETS ON THE JOB THEY WILL CONTINUE TO NEED ONGOING SUPPORT THEY'LL BE INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO NEED SOME ASSISTANCE ON HOW TO HANDLE THAT. BUT THAT A PROGRAM COULD HELP TEACHERS DEAL WITH A RANGE OF DISABILITIES. I'M ON PAGE SEVEN WE HAVE A FEW MORE RECOMMENDATIONS THE STATE ALSO COULD FACILITATE CREATING THESE FOR YOUR PROGRAMS WHERE INDIVIDUALS GET THEIR BACHELORS OF EDUCATION. AS WELL AS THAT SPECIAL THATCREDENTIAL IN A BLENDED FASHION. THIS IS AN AREA WHERE ONE TIME MONEY COULD ACTUALLY HAVE LONG STANDING BENEFIT SO THE STATE PROVIDES A SMALL AMOUNTS OF INSIDE OF MONEY FIRST YES YOU AND OTHER TEACHER PREP PROGRAMS TO CREATE THE PROGRAMS AND THEN THEY GO ON EXISTING FOR A LONG TIME. AND INDIVIDUALS ARE PRODUCED MARK QUICKLY FOR THE WORK FORCE. AND LASTLY FOR THIS. SPECIALIST PROGRAMS THAT ARE IMPACTED WE RECOMMEND PROVIDING SPECIAL ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING JUST FOR THOSE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY AND SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROGRAMS. AND IF YOU DON'T FIVE PERCENT INCREASES IN ENROLLMENT A YEAR FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS IT COST. X. HONORS LET ME FIVE THOUSAND ROUGHLY TO SUPPORT THAT LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT. TIMES. AND THAT'S I I'D WITH FEW DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT YOU MIGHT WANNA CONSIDER AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED OKAY. THANK YOU. DO YOU. GOOD MORNING KIMBERLY LEAHY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR TWO NEW TEACHER WORKFORCE INVESTMENT INITIATIVES THAT FOCUS ON THE RECRUITMENT PREPARATION. AND RETENTION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. THERE HAS BEEN A PERENNIAL SHORTAGE IN THE NUMBER OF FULLY CREDENTIALED SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS FOR DECADES THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE. MOST CONCERNING THOUGH THE NUMBER OF SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS PROVIDING INSTRUCTION WITH A SUB STANDARD CREDENTIAL CONTINUES TO RISE. RECENT NUMBERS FROM THE COMMISSION INDICATE THAT MORE THAN HALF OF NEW SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS CREDENTIALED IN THE LAST YEAR. RANJHA PREPARED AND ARE WORKING ON TEMPORARY PERMITS OR WAIVERS. AND RESPONSE TO THIS NEED. AND BECAUSE TWO THIRDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING POOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PERFORMANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. PROVIDES FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINE NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR THE TEACHER RESIDENTS TO GRANT PROGRAM. TO PROVIDE ONE TIME COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO DEVELOP NEW OR EXPAND EXISTING TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. RESIDENCIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECRUIT AND SUPPORT THE PREPARATION OF NEW SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT RESIDENCY PROGRAMS RESULT IN HIGHER RETENTION RATES OF NEWLY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS AT FIVE YEARS THAN TRADITIONAL PATHWAYS. THE GRANT PROGRAM WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE COMMISSION THE FUNDS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR FIVE YEARS. ELEAZAR RECEIVE A GRANT AWARD WOULD RECEIVE UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PARTICIPATING TEACHER CANDIDATE I WOULD NEED TO PROVIDE A LOCAL GRANT FOR A LOCAL MATCH. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROVIDES FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. TO DEVELOPMENT EMPLOYMENT. NEW OR EXPAND EXISTING. LOCALLY IDENTIFIED TRANSFORMATIONAL SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS A LOCAL NEED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. THE FOCUS WILL BE ON GENERATING NEWLY CREDENTIALED SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS. THE GRANT WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE COMMISSION THE FUNDS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS. ELEAZAR RECEIVE A GRANT WOULD BE REQUIRED RECEIVE UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PARTICIPATING TEACHER CANDIDATE I WOULD NEED TO PROVIDE A LOCAL MATCH. THESE FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR EXAMPLE ON PROGRAMS SUCH AS GROW YOUR OWN PROGRAMS. ONE I DID THAT IN NATIONALLY IS BEING. IMPLEMENTED AND HEARING CALIFORNIA. IS BY. I BELIEVE THERE'S ONE DISTRICT THAT I'VE HEARD OF THAT IS DOING THIS A GROW YOUR OWN PROGRAM WHERE THEY'RE RECRUITING THEIR HIGH SCHOOL. GRADUATES TO ENTER INTO OF A TEACHER PREP OR AT A FOUR YEAR DEGREE AND THEN A TEACHER PREP PROGRAM AND THEN RETURN TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE THEY JUST GRADUATED FROM FOUR YEARS EARLIER. AND I TEACH AT THAT DISTRICT PLEASE CARP PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND ARE LIKELY TO STAY ON LONGER AND HAVE MORE COMMITMENT AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN RECRUITED FROM OUT OF STATE OR FROM OTHER REGIONS. AND. BECAUSE WE HAVE JUST RECENTLY INVESTED. SPOKE QUITE A BIT OF A. FOUR YEAR A TEACHER PREPARATION INTEGRATED PROGRAMS THESE NEW CANDIDATES COULD ACTUALLY COMPLETE THEIR. OF PREPARATION TO TEACH IN FOUR YEARS. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. NOT YET. BERMAN OF EDUCATION. BUT BROWN ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM TRUCKS AT ALL JUST AT THAT A COUPLE OF OF COMMENTS TO THAT WHICH IS THAT WE WE DO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. TO PROVIDE THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR I RECRUITING AND RETAINING SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WHAT CERTAINLY ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WE DO SO WE DO REALIZE. FUND THAT. PROVIDING THIS IMMEDIATE IN AND JACKSON AND THE PIPELINE IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND SO WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING AND RE ENVISIONING SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER CREDENTIALS. AND AS SUCH WERE SUPPORTIVE OF FUNDING TO ENSURE SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS HAVE THE NECESSARY SUPPORTS IN THEM MENTORSHIPS TO ENSURE THE HIGH QUALITY PROVISIONS OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND RELATED SERVICES SO WE FULLY SUPPORT THAT GOVERNOR'S. UP PROPOSAL I'M AGAINST PROVIDE A QUICK UPDATE ON THE A FVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PROVIDED IN IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET FOR. US. HELP ADDRESS THE BILINGUAL TEACHER SHORTAGES WELLS'S WE LOOK AT THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDING SUPPORT WHERE WE DO HAVE AREAS FUND SO THAT THE I'M A GRANT AWARDS WE HAD FIFTEEN APPLICATIONS FOR THOSE OF FUNDS. AND WE AWARDED AND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO EIGHT COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AROUND THE STE AT AROUND THE STATE. WITH THE INTENT AROUND HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BILINGUAL TEACHERS PROVIDE SUPPORT AND MEMBERSHIP AND MENTORSHIP FOR A BILINGUAL TEACHERS. AND ALSO INCREASE THE PIPELINE AND SO WHERE THOSE. AT EIGHT AGENCIES HAVE UNTIL AT JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY TO SPEND THOSE FUNDS AND AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU I SKIPPED USE AYE THAT'S OKAY. NOT FROM. US EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE A REPORTING SHORTAGES ACROSS THE BOARD. THE MOST CHRONIC AREAS CONTINUE TO BE STEM IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. OF THE LARGEST GROWING SECTION OF OUR SECTOR OF CREDENTIALS ARE PERMITS THAT WERE ISSUE IN OUR TROOPS ARE EMERGENCY PERMITS AND WE ISSUED AS MANY AS TWELVE THOUSAND OF THEM LAST YEAR. THERE WERE ON TRACK THIS YEAR TO MEET THAT NUMBER IF NOT EXCEEDED. OF SUPPLY IS NOT KEEPING PACE WITH DEMAND THAT'S NOT A NEW STORY HERE IN THE STABLE AT THIS TABLE. WE HAVE BEEN PLEASED THAT THE COMMISSION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ISSUANCE OF SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT FUNDS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. FIVE MILLION TO READ AND I READ STATE DATA CENTER FOR TEACHING CAREERS THAT HAS NOW GONE ONLINE THEY'RE DOING JOB FAIRS ARE DOING PSAS THEY ARE. A FUNCTIONING FULLY FUNCTIONING NOW AT A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD UNDERGRADUATE TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS. FORTY ONE INSTITUTIONS PARTICIPATED IN THOSE GRANDSON ARE STARTING PROGRAMS THIS FALL TWENTY ONE OF THOSE ARE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. EIGHTEEN OF THE GRANTEES ARE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND THERE ARE WE'RE GETTING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE OPPORTUNITY FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL SO THAT'S AN IDEA THAT HAS TAKEN SOME ROUTE AND WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE WHAT IT WILL PRODUCE. THE CLASSIFIED A GRANT PROGRAM HAS ALSO BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL WE'VE ISSUED TWO ROUNDS OF GRANTS TO SUPPORT DID A TWENTY TWO HUNDRED. CANDIDATES IN THAT PROGRAM IN THE LAST ROUND THAT WE JUST RAN WE HAD PROBABLY TWO TO THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS AS COULD BE FUNDED. ALSO SOME SOME SIGNIFICANT OUR RESOURCES HAVE BEEN INVESTED WE'RE HOPING THAT ALL OF THEM TOGETHER WILL PRODUCE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE THOUSAND TEACHERS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL TO REALLY FOCUS IN ON SPECIAL EDUCATION WE BELIEVE IS AN ESSENTIAL NEXT STEP. THE FIFTY MILLION FOCUSED ON TEACHER RESIDENCIES WILL BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUILD CAPACITY FOR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IN TERMS OF THE MENTOR TEACHERS THAT THEY BRING ON BOARD TO SUPPORT SPECIAL ED TEACHERS IN TRAINING AND IN TERMS OF THE NEW TEACHERS THAT THEY BRING IN. THAT PROGRAM. IN AND OF ITSELF THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM COULD RESULT IN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TEACHERS OVER THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS. THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE OUR LOCAL SOLUTIONS GRANT ALSO WHAT WE FOUND FROM DISTRICTS WHEN HE RAN THE CAL ED OF GRANT PROGRAM WITH THE TULARE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION THAT WAS A NINE BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM. AGAIN. THE NEED FOR TEACHER DEVELOPMENT A TEACHER RECRUITMENT FAR EXCEEDED THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN THAT CROWD PROGRAM BUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THEY ASK FOR RAN. ACROSS A RANGE OF INCENTIVES FROM LOAN FORGIVENESS WHICH IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY THINGS WE HEAR FROM TEACHERS. OF THAT DISCOURAGES THEM OR FOR. AT THAT THEY'RE GONNA WALK AWAY WITH A COMPARED TO THE SALARY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO EARN AND THAT'S NOT DID DID DID DOESN'T APPEAL TO. A WIDE SWATH OF OF POTENTIAL CANDIDATES SO PROVIDING LOCAL SOLUTIONS OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR AN ALLEY A TO SAY WELL WE WILL FORGIVE YOUR LOUNGE ROOM REPAY YOUR LOANS IF YOU COME TO WORK FOR US. OR A HIRING INCENTIVE FOR A HOUSING INCENTIVE OR SOME OTHER THING THAT IS THE PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT THEY THINK WILL BRING THE SPECIAL EDUCATORS INTO THEIR DISTRICT. BASED ON LOCAL LEADS THAT'S THE THAT DRIVING THEME OF THE LOCAL SOLUTIONS GRANT WE THINK BOTH OF THESE THINGS ARE VERY TIMELY FOR THE REASONS THAT. FINANCES HAS MENTIONED TO YOU FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO SPECIAL EDUCATION IN CHANGES IN BACK CREDENTIALING WE HAVE OVERHAULED THAT CREDENTIAL WE SPENT THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WORKING WITH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. A RE CONCEPTUALIZING. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN SPECIAL EDUCATION SOUP TO NUTS? WHAT WE'VE DONE AT THE COMMISSION TABLE IS VERY RECENTLY RESTRUCTURED THAT CREDENTIAL IN WAYS THAT WE THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE POWERFULLY? IMPORTANT FOR THE QUALITY OF THAT WORKFORCE MOVING FORWARD WE CONSIDERED THE COMMISSION CONSIDERED WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE ONE SINGLE SPECIAL EDUCATION CREDENTIAL OR CONTINUE TO HAVE AREAS OF SPECIALIZATION AND WE'VE VETTED THAT IDEA WIDELY. WITH TEACHERS WITH ADMINISTRATORS WITH EMPLOYERS ARE AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THERE'S A SMALL MINORITY WHO THINK A SINGLE CREDENTIAL WOULD BE WOULD MAKE FOR UTILITY HITTER THAT YOU COULD PLACE ANYWHERE. BUT THE LARGER CONCERN IN THE REASON THE COMMISSION MAINTAINED TWO DISTINCT. ACTUALLY FIVE DISTINCT BUT THREE OF THEM ARE AREAS OF SPECIALIZATION IN TWO OR FOR THE MORE GENERAL POPULATION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. IS THAT THEY ARE THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT. KINDS OF NEEDS THAT NEED TO BE MET AND IF WE PUT ALL OF THAT TOGETHER IN ONE SINGLE PROGRAM WE WILL LENGTHEN THE TIME THAT IT TAKES TO GET CREDENTIALS IN THIS AREA. AND WE MAY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO COME IN AND DO IT SO THE NEW STRUCTURE MAINTAINS A MILD TO MODERATE SUPPORT NEEDS CREDENTIAL AND A SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT NEEDS CREDENTIAL. BUT ONE OF THE COMMISSION'S INTENTIONS HERE'S TO MAKE BRIDGING BETWEEN THESE CREDENTIAL AREAS READILY AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR CANDIDATES WOULD LIKE TO ADD. THAT THE SECOND CREDENTIAL SO WE ARE DOING OF WHAT WE THINK THE FIELD NEEDS US TO DO TO GET THE CREDENTIAL IN ORDER. SO THAT WE HAVE TEACHERS WHO ARE WELL PREPARED TO WORK WITH THAT WITHOUT POPULATION. IN THE IN THE SCHOOLS SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR IT LAYING IT OUT PRESS THIS CONTINUES TO BE. A THORNY ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS CAN YOU SAY THE NUMBER I KNOW YOU SAID I MEAN. INDIVIDUALS ARE APPLYING EVERY YEAR FOR EMERGENCY BUT WHAT'S THE NUMBER OF CURRENT. PEOPLE WHO ARE TEACHING WITH EMERGENCY CREDENTIAL SO THIS YEAR I AM NOT I DON'T HAVE THE DATA FOR THE EIGHTEEN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN YEAR THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE HAD TWELVE THOUSAND LAST YEAR AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN APPLY THAT WORD THAT WILL THEY LET'S THEY HAVE WE PRESUME THEY'RE TEACHING ONCE I HAVE IT IT'S WHEN YOUR DOCUMENT. AND THAT'S THAT'S GROWING THAT DOES. MORE THAN THE LIKE SIX THOUSANDS LESS. AND THAT WOULD BE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION SO LAST YEAR THAT THE WHOLE POPULATION OF. YOU SPECIAL WELL I THINK THERE MIGHT INCLUDE INTERNS AS WELL AS OF THE EMERGENCY PERMITS AND AND WAIVERS ON BUT TAKEN TOGETHER THOSE ARE. THAT'S THE POPULATION THAT IS EITHER IN TRAINING OR RECEIVING SUPPORT WHILE THEY ARE PROVIDING TEACHING SERVICES BUT NOT TO GET IN TRAINING. OKAY. IF I MIGHT JUST LAND JUST A SECOND OF HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND BECAUSE MANY STATE INITIATIVES WERE MENTIONED THE STATE HAS TRIED LOTS OF THINGS ON THE MARGIN FOR A LONG TIME YET SO THEY'VE TRIED. COVERING THE COST OF THE TRAINING INITIALLY WHETHER IT THROUGH THE THROUGH EIGHT OR LOAN FORGIVENESS THEY'VE TRIED RECRUITMENT CENTERS THEY'VE TRIED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. MANY THINGS AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE HEARING THIS YEAR IS A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS ON A ONE TIME BASIS. SO. EAT IT. YOU CAN DO THAT BUT IF IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM REYES SO I THINK IF THE STATE WANTS TO BE FIVE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD AND BE IN A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT POSITION AND HOUSE TO THINK ABOUT FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT WAY TO GO ABOUT DEALING WITH THE ISSUE. OKAY. AND THEN AS FAR AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I KNOW THE BUDGET IS WHAT IS TODAY BUT IT IF THERE WAS. AN OPPORTUNITY. IN THAT MAY REVISION ARE THERE OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU THINK WARRANT INVESTMENT TO ROUTE YOU FOCUS ON THE IN INCREASING THAT. ALLOCATION FOR THE EXISTING ONES I KNOW THE PRIOR YEARS WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED AT OTHER IDEAS. DO YOU HAVE ANY. YOU MEAN SOMETHING NEW FOR MAY REVISIONS CRORES OKAY WELL FOR. I I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE MAY REVISION AT THIS TIME HOWEVER. THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY THESE TWO. TWO ALLOTMENTS FOR TEACHER INVESTMENTS I'M WE STILL WOULD WANT TO FOCUS ON SPECIAL EDUCATION FOR THOSE TWO INVESTMENTS BUT I GUESS IF THERE WAS MORE IF THERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST MORE IN THE. WORKFORCE ISSUES WOULD WOULD YOU PUT MORE MONEY FOR IT SPECIAL ADD OR. OR MORE. OR BROUGHT IT MAYBE HAVE THE RESIDENCY OPEN UP FOR IT YOU KNOW WE DID THE CLASSIFIED PROGRAM LAST YEAR'S FINALLY GLAD THERE'S. AS THE LA I JUST MENTION THERE'S THERE OTHER IDEAS WE'VE BEEN. DABBLING IN. AND I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD BASICALLY HAVE TO TAKE THESE IDEAS BACK TO MANAGEMENT AND OKAY WHO WE COULD CONSIDER THEM. FAIR ENOUGH THANK YOU. MR DOT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. JUST A COMMENT FOR SO I THINK FIVE CREDENTIALS JUST TO ME SEEMS LIKE AN AWFUL LOT SEEM LIKE AN AWFUL LOT. BUT. I A I GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE I JUST THINK FIVE SEEMS LIKE AN AWFUL LOT. BUT WITH REGARD TO THE MONEY JUST FOR SPECIAL ED I THE PROBLEM. THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DRESS AS A UNIQUE WE HAVE A TEACHER CRISIS THAT SPREADS BEYOND. SPECIAL EDUCATION SO I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT GOING MUCH BROADER THAN JUST SPECIAL EDUCATION. WE KNOW THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION ASSIST SITUATION HAS BEEN PERSISTENT FOR SURE. BUT AGAIN I% IN THE THEY THE CHALLENGES MUCH BROADER AND GROWING DAILY. AND MAYBE ONE OF YOU CAN RESPOND AS IT MIGHT OF BEEN ANSWERED ALREADY. WITH REGARD TO SPECIALIST THE SPECIAL EDUCATION A CREDENTIAL. THE. COULDN'T A ANY. A COLLEGE NOW OFFER A SPECIAL EDUCATION DEGREE. SO THEY COULD GET. YOU KNOW THEY COULD GET THAT CREDENTIAL HIM IN A MORE EXPEDITED FASHION THEY COULD HAVE IN THE PAST WHERE THEY HAD A STANDALONE EXPERIENCE THE FOR YOUR DEGREE. AND THEN HAD TO GO TO WORK ON THE. ON THE ON THE CREDENTIAL LATER IS THERE ANY COLLEGES THAT ARE BLENDING THESE THAT THAT. YOU CAN GET IT DONE ENOUGH FOR YOUR MODEL YES IN POINT OF FACT THE INTEGRATED GRANT PROGRAM BECAUSE THE SUPPORT OF JUST EXACTLY THAT THE COMPLETION OF A CREDENTIAL IN A DEGREE WITHIN FOUR YEARS. TWENTY ONE INSTITUTIONS HAVE BUILT THOSE PROGRAMS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION THEIR OPENING IN THIS FALL. SO THEY HAVE A SPECIAL EDUCATION DEGREE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR DEGREES WILL BE AND THEY COULD TO IT THAT THEY HAD. DISCRETION AROUND THAT I AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS RECENT LEGISLATION A COUPLE YEARS AGO TO ALLOW THE EDUCATION MAJOR AGAIN FOR LAST YEAR AND LIKE THOSE LAST JUST LAST YEAR. UP I DON'T GROUP I DON'T RECALL WHETHER THAT ENCOMPASS SPECIAL EDUCATION OR NOT AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK I'LL I THOUGHT IT WAS MY BILL AND I DON'T RECALL I. DON'T REMEMBER UT I ALL FIND OUT AND GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT LET YOU KNOW I NEED TO FIND THAT OUT YEAH. THERE MAY BE SOMEONE BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT MAYBE WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE. IT WAS RATHER WE NEED TO DO THINGS ALL DIFFERENTLY. I BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM THAT IS PERSISTENT AND I GREW THAT MAYBE. FROM SACRAMENTO LEVEL WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE RCS YEARS RIGHT BECAUSE THOSE OWNS THOSE THE WORKHORSE OF THE TEACHER CREDENTIALING SYSTEM AYE AYE EVEN AYE YAY WONDER WHY YOU SEE OFFERS A TEACHING CREDENTIAL QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S. I THINK IT ALSO REFOCUSED AND HOUSED IN THE CSU OR HAVE ONE PLACE YOU KNOW WITH THE EXPERTISE YOU KNOW ONE ONE STOP SHOP IF YOU WILL. BUT I WONDER IF THERE'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO FROM AND IF SOMEONE STICK. YEAH COMING ON THE SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE A SACRAMENTO OF TO INCENTIVIZE. OF THE CSU SYSTEM TO CREATE SUCH A PROGRAM FIRST WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IT'S LEGAL. SECOND WE NEED TO SEE HOW WE GET IT DUCTS OF ANYONE WANTS TO COMMENT ON WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TRACK JUST THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS THE LEGISLATION TO CREATE INTEGRATED PROGRAMS BUT WHAT WE'VE HEARD WHEN WE'VE HOUSES THAT. INTEGRATED SORT OF TOOK OFF FOUR YEAR BACHELOR'S PROGRAM AND TOP DON WHO ONE YOU'RE PREGNANT WE ASK THE COMPANY CREDITS DO YOU NEED. TO GO THROUGH IT SOUNDS LIKE THE OLD CREDITS IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU CAN'T REASONABLY DO THAT I'M FOR YEARS AND IT'S STILL I THINK LIMITED TELAMON TREE SCHOOLS. SO IT AND MOST VIRTUALLY ALL OTHER STATES ALLOW STUDENTS TO GO THROUGH THIS IN A MUCH MORE SEAMLESSLY WAY MUCH MORE QUICKLY EFFECTIVELY GETTING SPECIAL AT WORK SPECIAL A TEACHER TRAINING IN THE SPECIAL ED CREDENTIAL SIMULTANEOUSLY. IN BITS YOU TALK ABOUT THE GRINCH ON TALK ABOUT AGREE WHAT IF YOU HAD. ESPECIALLY DEGREE. RIGHT THAT'S WHY I THINK WE WERE GOING SO THE ANSWER IS NO SPECIAL EDUCATION WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THAT BILL. WILL BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING TO GO BACK AND CLEAN UP. POTENTIALLY SOME WILL HAVE A CONVERSATION THANK YOU. BUT I'D COULD I JUST ANSWER ONE OF THE QUESTION TERMS OF THE FIVE CREDENTIALS THREE OF THEM ARE FOR LOW INCIDENCE SO ONE OF THE SPECIAL AYE CREDENTIALS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. A SECOND IS FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENTS A THIRTIES FOR DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING. THOSE THREE CREDENTIALS ARE SO SPECIALIZED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN MAINTAIN THE OTHER TWO HAVE BEEN THAT'S A REDUCTION FROM. WE ELIMINATED TO AND CONSOLIDATED THEM INTO JUST TO WE USED TO HAVE FOR ADDITIONAL AND THERE WERE SEVEN OTHER FIVE IN ON IT AND THOSE TWO ONE IS FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING STUDENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE SPORT NEEDS. IS COULD BE STUDENTS WITH AUTISM THESE COULD BE STUDENTS WITH BEHAVIORAL ISSUES THAT COULD BE SO IT'S THE SPECIAL EDUCATION. OF THAT IS CONSIDERED MILD TO MODERATE THIS THE OTHER BRANCH DEAD THE COMMISSION DECIDED TO MAINTAIN WAS FOCUSED ON SIGNIFICANT. MORE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT NEEDS THAT COULD INVOLVE. PARAPLEGIC STUDENTS STUDENTS WHO HAVE PHYSICAL HANDICAPS THAT INTERFERE WITH THEIR LEARNING IN THEIR TEACHERS NEED TO KNOW DIFFERENT THINGS TO HELP THEM ACCESS LEARNING SO THE COMMISSION REALLY JUST DETERMINED. THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE TEACHERS WHO WERE WELL PREPARED FOR THE POPULATION OF STUDENTS WE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN THESE DISTINCTIONS. ARE AND NOT TRY AND BLEND IT ALL INTO ONE LONGER. A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM RIGHT SO I THESE FIVE CREDENTIALS ARE THEY. SILOS. OR IS IT YOU GET YOUR SPECIAL ED CREDENTIAL THAT COVERS GENERAL SPECIAL AND EVERYONE A LABEL THAT. AND THEN YOU GET AN AUTHORIZATION. TWO TO TO TO TO TO WORKING CLASS OR TOWARD CHILDREN MIGHT HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS I REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION BECAUSE THE AT THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE CHANGE WE'VE MADE IN THE SPECIAL A CREDENTIAL. IS TO REMOVE IT FROM ITS SILO. TO CREATE A COMMON CORE PREPARATION THAT ALL GEN ED AND ALL SPECIALIST TEACHERS COMPLETE TOGETHER. A WHERE THEY LEARN ABOUT TEACHING AND LEARNING IN LEANING TO DIE LEARNING TO TEACH A DIVERSE THE FULL DIVERSE. STUDENT POPULATION THAT WE HAVE AND THEN SPECIALIZATIONS ARE ADDED ON THAT COMMON CENTRAL CORE OF PREPARATION OR TRUNK PREPARATION I HAVE A PICTURE OF A TRIO OF HAPPY THAT WE SHARE WITH YOU IT'S BEEN A METAPHOR FOR IT. BUT THAT COMMON TRUNK IS THAT THAT'S THE NEW CHANGE IN THAT WHAT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT IS THAT IS THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS BEEN FUNDED AND IS EXPANDING MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT. AS A FRAMEWORK FOR DELIVERY OF STUDENT I SERVICES TO ALL STUDENTS THIS MODEL MATCHES THAT FRAME FOR HOW WE THINK ABOUT TEACHING OUR STUDENTS WERE ALL STUDENTS ARE JANET STUDENTS FIRST. AND WHEN THEY NEED AN INTERVENTION THEY HAVE SOMEONE WITH THE TRAINING TO PROVIDE THAT INTERVENTION BUT THEY ARE SILENT THAT I THINK IS THE VISION OF ANTI SS BUT RECOGNIZING THAT MTS THIS IS LOW LIVES IN A STATE WHERE WE STILL HAVE A WIDER WAY. OF WAYS IN WHICH WE SERVE STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS SOMETIMES IN A SILO ROAD. CLASSROOMS SOMETIMES IN INTEGRATED CLASSROOMS FULLY I INCLUDED ON BUT THE CREDENTIAL IS INTENDED TO SERVE THAT MULTIPLICITY OF WAYS WE DELIVER SERVICES BUT REALLY DRIVE TO WORK THIS CALM AND. UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE ALL BELONG TO ALL TEACHERS SO QUICKLY THEY LET ME HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT IS SO DO I GET A CREDENTIAL. TO WORK WITH CHILDREN WHO ARE VISUALLY IMPAIRED ESPECIALLY CREDENTIAL OR CHILDREN ARE VISUALLY IMPAIRED OR DOING ESPECIALLY CREDENTIAL THEN I GET AN AUTHORIZATION. TO WORK WITH CHILDREN OR VISUALLY IMPAIRED. SO THE CREDENTIAL ITSELF WOULD CARRY THAT AUTHORIZATION SO IT'S NOT DO ONE AND THEN DO THE OTHER. SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE VIEW WHAT WE VISUALIZE FOR THE AYE TEACHERS WHO WILL TEACH VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENTS SAID THEY ENGAGE IN THAT COMMON TRUCK PREPARATION WITH GEN ED AND ALL OTHER SPECIAL ED TEACHERS. ARE AND THEN THEY BEGIN TO SPECIALIZE ON WHAT ARE THE PARTICULAR NEEDS THAT VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENTS NEED AND HOW DO YOU DELIVER THOSE. AND THEY WILL LEARN ONE CREDENTIAL THAT AUTHORIZATION WILL BE WITHIN IT IF THEY WANT TO ADD DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING TO COMPLETE THE SAME TRUNK AGAIN. THEY HAVE TO AT THE SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE TO ADD AN AUTHORIZATION A DEAF AND HARD HEARING THEY WANT TO ADD. ANY OTHER IT WE'RE LOOKING AT HAVING MORE FOCUSED BRIDGES AND ELIMINATING DUPLICATION. WHERE WHERE A CANDIDATE WHO WANTED TO ADD SOMETHING WOULD HAVE TO START OVER AND DO A WHOLE CONFERENCE PROGRAM SINCE UP I'M STILL NOT? SO TO IF I IF I GET A SPECIAL EDUCATION CREDENTIAL. FOR IS A SPECIAL EDUCATION CREDENTIAL FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED OR AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION CREDENTIAL WHAT I'D BE ABLE TO TO. TO WORK IN A STE IN A. SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM SETTING WHERE THERE MIGHT NOT BE STUDENTS WHO ARE VISUALLY IMPAIRED TO HAVE THAT BASE. NO. YEAH THAT BASS OCCURS I EACH EACH OF THE BRANCHES WILL HAVE A BASE THAT IS PART OF THEIR AREA OF SPECIALIZATION SO IF YOU GO FOR INTERNATIONAL ENGLISH AT SEATTLE'S I'M SORRY. IS YOUR JOB. YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN HAVING THIS DISCUSSION FOR SOME LONG AND I WAS. LISTENING VERY INTENTLY. BUT I'M CONCERNED ONE. STATEMENTS ARE BEING MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION SAYS. THIS IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. AND WE'RE SPENDING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SHARE. SO. BUT WE'RE NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEM WE IN THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T GIVE ME A LOT OF COMFORT. NOW I KNOW BECAUSE I ATTENDED A FEW OF THEM. WE HAD THE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AROUND THE STATE ON ON THIS ISSUE. SO I GUESS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS THAT WE CONDUCTED. ARE THEY BEING CONSIDERED IN AND TRYING TO SOLVE. EFFORT AND ON BEHALF OF. WRITTEN IT TOOK TO DO THINGS SO WHEN IT WE DO THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT START TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM WE THINK THERE ARE OTHER THINGS. THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TIME SO IT'S IN ITS INITIAL INVESTMENTS WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT MENTORSHIPS COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE OTHER WAYS TO SUPPORT TEACHERS TO STAY AND SO. I WENT THAT WE THINK IT'S A GOOD START TO GETTING TO THE PROBLEM. AND THEN TAKE IT I WOULD DEFERRED TO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS SINCE THEY WERE THE ONES THAT. I'M AT THOSE MEETINGS. BUT THOSE AYE INPUT SESSIONS. WELL THE PART OF FINANCE TALKED EARLIER SAID THAT SHE HAD GONE BACK SO OVER TO THE DOCTOR THEN. DOCTOR SANDY THE. YOU. YOU OUTLINED HIS TRUNK CONCEPT BUREAU MULTI TIERED SUPPORT SYSTEM. VERY WELL. DOES THEM HUNDRED MILLION WE'RE PUTTING IN SUPPORT THAT NEW VISION YOU HAVE YES IT ABSOLUTELY DOES. ABSOLUTELY SO WE'VE CHANGED THE CREDENTIAL WHERE ADOPTING NEW STANDARDS WE EXPECT AS EARLY AS A FEW WEEKS FROM NOW OF FOR THE SPECIAL EDUCATION CREDENTIAL. IF THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ARRIVES IN THE BUDGET JULY ONE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STIMULATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. THAT MEET THIS NEW. CREDENTIALS STRUCTURE AT THE SAME TIME AS WE ARE WORKING WITH ALL OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN THE STATE TO UPDATE TO NEW STANDARDS. THIS WILL BE A STIMULUS IT'LL BE. AN INCENTIVE REALLY IF YOU WILL FOR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES THIS A SCHOOL DISTRICT BASED FUNDING AND THE DISTRICT WILL BE THE HOME OF THESE RESIDENCIES. SO THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THEIR CAPACITY TO TRAIN THEIR OWN TEACHERS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH VOTE WITH A TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM IS THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT HERE I TERMS OF JUST BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF THE SYSTEM. AT AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO BUILD THAT AND IT WILL BE WE SEE THESE THINGS MERGING WE HAVE THREE THINGS THAT ARE MERGING AT THE SAME TIME. THE EXPANSION OF MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT WHICH IS A NEW VISION FOR HOW WE DELIVER SERVICES TO ALL STUDENTS. THE CHANGE IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION CREDENTIAL WHICH FEEDS INTO THAT IDEA THAT ALL TEACHERS ARE TEACHERS OF ALL STUDENTS AND THEY ALL HAVE SOME WORK TO DO IN A GEN ED INCLUDED SPACE. AND THEN THIRDLY AT THE EXCELLENT THAT FUNDING WILL PROVIDE TO RECRUIT TEACHERS INTO THESE NEW PATHWAYS OF PREPARATION ND TO ENABLE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TO PROVIDE SOME INCENTIVE TO HIRE THEM. KNOW THAT LEGEND LIST IS RAISE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER COMPENSATION IS THE BIGGER ISSUE THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM THAT WE CAN SOLVE. A THAT'S A MUCH BIGGER CONVERSATION THAN THAN THIS IS ABOUT WHAT THIS WILL DO IS BRING FIVE THOUSAND SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS IN. TO HOPEFULLY REPLACE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVING ON ON EMERGENCY PERMITS IN THOSE SETTINGS AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO DO I I WOULD JUST ARGUE THAT THAT THAT IT'S IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TIMELY. MERGE OF THREE VERY IMPORTANT IDEAS. THAT I THINK AREGOING TO BE TRANSFORMATIVE FOR THE SCHOOLS. NOW FOR THE LA ELKS I WOULD GET IT IS TO WAY USERS THE. THE ISSUE OF MONEY THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN. BUT THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE AND I THINK THE LA A BROUGHT IT UP AS FAR AS THE. THE STRUCTURE OR HOW WE DEVELOP. PEOPLE GOING INTO THIS THIS AREA. AND ALSO I'VE READ REPORT BELIEVE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE WORLD TO SEE ISSUES ARE GOING TO PLAY THIS ROLE THANK. SO. FROM AN ALLEY ó PERSPECTIVE. DO YOU AGREE THAT WAS JUST PRESENTED BY. DOCTOR SANDY TO WE MISSING SOMETHING. THEY SHE SHE OUTLINED IT THIS THIS SYSTEMIC OF THE PROBLEM SHE SAYS SHE'S GOT A PLAN TO TRANSITION TO GO THERE AND YOU'RE SAYING. NO WE'RE NOT WE NEED TO PAY MORE BUT ALSO THE SYSTEM AND I WE COULD ACTUALIZED PROBLEM SO. THIS YOU HAVE THE PATHWAY TO SOLUTION OR YOU THINK NOT. I THINK WHAT I HEARD IS THAT THE COMMISSION AS AN INSTITUTION US WORKING WITH AND AT STATUTORY FRAMEWORK TO. DO SOME THINGS TO SIMPLIFY THE CREDENTIAL PROCESS I THINK MANY LAYMAN'S REACTION LIKE MINE AS WELL IT'S STILL SOME COMPLICATED WELL I STILL NEED TO DO THAT IF I WANT TO LEARN THAT'S. IF I WANT TO SOME DAY WORK WITH. VISUALLY IMPAIRED STUDENTS I DO NEED EXTRA WORK EVEN IF IT'S NOT STARTING OVER I NEED TO DO SOMETHING EXTRA. AND. I THINK OUR PERSPECTIVE IS ALSO THE LEGISLATURE HAS TRIED MANY THINGS ARE MORE THAN FORTY YEARS DOWN THE ROAD AND WE STILL HAVE PROBLEMS AND I THINK SOME PEOPLE THINK THE PROBLEM IS JUST A SERIOUS TODAY HASN'T SUFFERED BAN. SUCH THAT. WHAT WOULD IT TAKE AND I THINK AGAIN TO PRODUCE MORE SPECIAL ED TEACHERS TIRED AND THEY KNOW THEY CAN GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY BY SHUFFLING CLASSROOMS TWO DOORS DOWN? OR LEAVE THE PROFESSION BECAUSE THEY WERE WELL SUPPORTED TO BEGUN WENT OFF AND THEY'RE TIRED AND THEY CAN GET PAID SUBSTANTIALLY MORE DOING SOMETHING ELSE. SO I THINK IF THE STATE WANTS TO BE IN A DIFFERENT POSITION YEARS FROM NOW AND HOW SO I I WOULD SUGGEST CONSIDER. WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO GET SPECIAL ED TEACHERS NOT JUST TO BE WELL PREPARED TO BEGIN WITH BUT TO STAY IN THEIR JOBS? TO GET BETTER AND BETTER AT DOING THEIR JOBS. AND I THINK THAT'S A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION BUT I DON'T THINK AN IMPOSSIBLE CONVERSATION I THINK THAT TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS AND YOU CAN SHARE THE SAME PERSPECTIVE OF NOT WANTING TO BE IN THE SAME PLACE FIFTEEN YEARS FROM NOW FIVE YEARS. BECAUSE I'M HERE IN THIS DAY AND THE IN. WELL IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIRECT THIS QUESTION TO. WE KNOW IT'S A PROBLEM. FORTY YEARS. I. SOFTLY UNDERSTANDING THE TRUNK METHOD YOU'RE TRYING TO DO FOR CREDENTIALING YOUR AND YOUR DRESSING THIS IS THAT MIX OF IT. BUT ALSO READING THE REPORTS AND HAVING GONE TO THE MEETINGS. ONE OF THE TWO BIG AREAS THAT I DON'T THINK DISCOVERS HOW MUCH IN CRACKING FROM WRONG DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THE ROOT ISSUE OF HOW YOU GET CREDENTIALING TRAIN PEOPLE WITH THIS EMPTY SS. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO COMPENSATE. PEOPLE IN THIS AREA. AND ADDITIONALLY WE NEED TO. DEVELOP SOME SUPPORT APPRENTICE MENTORSHIP PROGRAM. SO THAT WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE GO INTO THIS. YOU KNOW THE SUCCESSFUL. DOES. YOUR PROPOSAL OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MEET ALL THREE OF THOSE. ARE ONLY ONE OF THEM OR. WHAT IS IT DO? BECAUSE THEY LAID OUT THE SOLUTION SO. WHEN LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINE. SO REGARDING BUILDING CAPACITY. TO ACTUALLY TRAIN SPECIAL ED TEACHERS. PROPOSALS ADDRESS THE OKAY THAT'S THE CREDIT THAT'S. DOCTOR CHENEY'S POSITIONAL KIND OF ANYONE PRESENT THE RESIDENCIES OR EVEN THE LOCAL SOLUTIONS IF THEY DID GROW YOUR OWN PROGRAMS WITH WITH THAT PARTICULAR INVESTMENT. WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE THE PREPARATION AND RETENTION. I'M FROM A PREPARATION STANDPOINT. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SALARY. THAT IS A LOCAL DECISION IN CALIFORNIA STATUTE WHILE IT DOES SPECIFY A CERTAIN TYPE OF SALARY SCHEDULE FOR TEACHERS IT ALSO PROVIDES. THE AUTHORITY FOR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY ANY GROUP OF TEACHERS OR. A TYPE OF TEACHER AND PAY THEM MORE BASED ON THE WORK THAT THEY DO. AND SO. UNDER CURRENT STATUE. LOCALS HAVE AUTHORITY TO PAY SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WHAT THEY FEEL THEY NEED TO IN ORDER TO. COMPENSATE THEM FOR THE. THE ONEROUS NESS OF THE. POSITION. NOT THE STATE AT THIS TIME DOESN'T DICTATE. SALARIES FOR TEACHERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT IS SO UNDERSTAND EVIDENCE WHICH. POLYGAMIST A WHERE PERSPECTIVE OF PEOPLE GOING IN THIS CASE IF WE PUT HIM INTO THE PIPELINE. BUT IT WOULD PUT HIM UP TO VALUE BECAUSE THEY THEY DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT STRUCTURE BE THEY'RE NOT BEING COMPENSATED. ASSUME WHY AM I DOING THIS WHEN I CAN GO. BACK TO TEACH ENGLISH AND NOT EVEN DEAL WITH THIS. DOCTORS AND IS THAT A LITTLE MORE PERSPECTIVE ON THIS I THINK THAT THIS HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL COMPLIMENTS OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE'S MAY. INVESTMENT TO GROW AND ACCELERATE M. TSS. ACROSS THE STATE IS A SIGNIFICANT FOUNDATIONAL PART OF THIS. SO WE ARE CHANGING THE WAY WE DELIVER SERVICES TO KIDS WHEN WE'RE IN WITH SCHOOLS THAT ARE USING ON TSS IN WAYS THAT ARE VERY POSITIVE I'VE HEARD FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTING IT. WHERE THEIR PARENTS WERE SAYING CAN I TAKE MY KID OUT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO BE IN M. T. SS WHAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS THAT MTS ES IS STILL INCLUDE SPECIAL ED? BUT IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN RE CONCEPTUALIZE AS MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT IT EVERY KID IS GOING TO NEED SOME ASPECT OF SUPPORT THAT IT AND THEN THEY THEY ALL MOVE WITHIN THAT SYSTEM. IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T FEEL SILO THAT DOESN'T FEEL. LIKE THEY ARE LESS THAN THE OTHER STUDENTS AROUND THEM EVERYBODY'S AGENDA AT STUDENT AND THEY GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED THAT'S A CRITICAL FOUNDATION. WHAT THIS WILL DO IS BRING MORE TEACHERS AND NOW I'VE BEEN OUT VISITING SCHOOLS? IN TALKING TO TEACHERS IN TRAINING WENT TO THE LONG BEACH A TO A SCHOOL IN LONG BEACH. WHERE WE SAW ABOUT THIRTY DIFFERENT CANDIDATES WHO ARE SPONSORED BY CAL STATE LONG BEACH? THEY'RE EARNING BOTH THEIR GENERAL ED AND THEIR SPECIAL ED CREDENTIAL IN THERE DOING THEIR TRADE THEIR STUDENT TEACHING HERE AT THE SCHOOL IN AN INCLUDED MODEL. ALL WHEN ASKED WHETHER IF THEY'RE OFFERED A GENEROUS SPECIAL A JOB WHICH WHEN THEY WOULD TAKE. ALL OF THEM SAID THEY WOULD TAKE A SPECIAL A JOB THEY ARE HUNGRY FOR IT THEY KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY KNOW WHO THE STUDENTS ARE AND THEY WANT TO SERVE THEM AND THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN THEY'RE GETTING WELL TRAINED. TO DO SO AND GIVEN THE CHOICE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE CHOOSING SO WHEN I HEAR FROM TEACHERS SPECIAL ED TEACHERS WHO ARE WEARY. AND TWO THINGS THAT THEY RAISE ALL THE TIME BUT I AND I DON'T HEAR COMPENSATION MAYBE BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT'S AN INSOLUBLE PROBLEM BUT I HEAR CASELOAD. IS SIGNIFICANT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO MANAGE TE IT PIECE FOR IS SIGNIFICANT FOR THEM. AND THAT'S A FUNCTION OF SHORTAGE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TEACHERS TO SHARE THE CASELOAD OUT THERE. AND WE NEED MORE AND THIS IS A SOLUTION STRATEGY FOR THAT THE OTHER THING I HEAR IS PAPERWORK. OF THE AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION CREATOR HAS TO DO THE TAKES AWAY FROM THE SERVICES TO KIDS. IT IT MAKES THEM WEARY AND IT'S NOT THE WORK THEY SIGNED UP TO DO THEY WANT TO WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE SO THAT'S A SOLUTION WE'RE LOOKING FOR IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS OF MANAGING. THE PAPERWORK ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION BY HAVING OTHER INDIVIDUALS WERE TRAINED TO DO SO WE THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A BAY AREA WE NEED TO EXPLORE MORE FULLY. BUT ALL OF THIS WILL BE AIDED BY HAVING MORE FULLY PREPARED SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS IN THE SYSTEM TO SHARE THE LOAD. AND YOU WERE TRAINED IN THE WAY OF THINKING ABOUT AND DELIVERING SERVICES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATIONALIST LATER HAVE BEEN WORKING ON AN EMPTY SS. YEAH WELL THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME YOU KNOW I I THINK PETE TEACHERS WHO GO INTO THIS AREA SPECIAL ED. OUR OUR SPECIAL AND THEY DO IT FOR A REASON. I USE MY DAUGHTER'S AN EXAMPLE SHE'S ONE. AND I ASK YOU KNOW WHAT IN SHE TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND MADE SHE JUST. VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT SEEN SUCCESSES FOR THESE CHILDREN SO. I GUESS I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD DOCS ANY I'VE KNOWN KENTUCKY FOR YEARS BUT THE. YOU THINK THIS IS A. RIGHT PATH AGO I DO. THANK YOU AYE IM'S AYE A FINAL COMMENT SURE BUT I'M AND SOME OF THE THINGS AGAIN MANY OF THE THINGS ARE CARRYING PAPERWORK CASELOAD PAID. ONGOING ISSUES AND I THINK. THE COMMISSION MIGHT BE TRYING TO PUT SOME OF THE BEST LIGHT WHAT COULD A DISTRICT REALISTICALLY DO WITH THESE FUNDS BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO FINANCES PROPOSAL THERE REQUIRING DISTRICTS TO DO THOSE THINGS WORRY DISTRICT TO DO THEN YOU MIGHT GET A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN YOU OTHERWISE WOULD. BUT UNDER THE LOCAL SOLUTIONS THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO DO SOMETHING WITH MULTI STEERED TO SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO IMPROVE THEIR HR THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO GO TO THE TABLE ON THINK ABOUT SIMPLIFYING OUR PAPERWORK PROCESS IS. SO IF YOU WANNA IF SOMETHING YOU'RE IT IS RESONATING WITH YOU YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT THING AS OPPOSED TO JUST LETTING LOCAL SUBMIT PLANS TO DO. THINGS I THINK IMPORTANT WILL DEPART FINANCE YOU BE WILLING TO PUT THOSE. COMPONENTS. AND THE NEW REVISED. I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE ALEJO HAS JUST MENTIONED. ARE ACTUALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED THROUGH. OTHER PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SO FOR EXAMPLE. THE MTS SAYS THAT'S DOES THE DUSTBIN FUNDED. FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW AND THERE ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE. OF THIS WOULD JUST YOU KNOW I'M NOT TRYING TO PLAY DEBT FOR DEBT AND WAS DRYING ST WE. AFFIRMATIVE BUT THIS HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THERE STATEMENT FROM THE PARTRIDGE CATIONS SAYS SOCCER SOLVE PROBLEM WHAT'S GOING TO BE ON THE WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. IS ALL THE PROBLEM THEN BUT DIDN'T WE HAVE ARE POTENTIALLY AN EXPERT JOHN LEWIS. WE HAVE MTS ASSN WE HAVE A PLAN TO GO FORWARD. JUST THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDED INTO A COOLEY WINDOWS FOR A LONG TIME SO PLEASE THINK ABOUT IT. WEEK HAVE TWENTY FIVE REPUBLICAN VOTES TO BE WILLING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. IF YOU WILL NEED TO MOVE IT LET ME GET TO GET BACK YOUR SETS OF THIS IS THAT A GRANT PROGRAM RIGHTS ARE NOT EVERYONE'S GOING TO PARTICIPATES I THINK WHAT THE LA A MATCHING. WHAT SEE THIS WITH EVERY DISTRICT AND? THAT'S ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS BUT MAYBE I'LL GO BACK TO YOU MISKIN AT AND I I APPRECIATE THAT THOUGHTFULNESS OF WHAT YOU'RE. TALKING ABOUT THIS IS. A LINGERING ISSUE. AND. BUT THE MONEY WE HAVE AVAILABLE IS IS ONE TIME SO YOU'RE YOU'RE SOLUTIONS DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND THEY BEAT DIFFERENTIAL PAY AND HOW WE TAKE A LOOK AT. OUT HOW DO YOU DO THAT WITH ONE TIME MONEY IS NEED ONGOING. COMMITMENT AND SO THE GOVERNOR FOR WRONG OR RIGHT BASED UPON THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM WE HAVE. POT OF HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME TO TACKLE IT IN SO. I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE DEALING WITH BUT THIS WELL. SO. THAT WOULD WE HEAR HEAR THIS. WE HEAR THE KIDDIES ISSUES. OUT HIS MINISTER MURATSUCHI. TOM. I'M MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THE FULL HISTORY OF THE ISSUE OF DIFFERENCE DIFFERENTIAL PAY BUT TO. ME THE ALEJO MADE IT CLEAR WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS. THE COURT NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR THE SHORTAGE. BOTH FOR SPECIAL LED AN FOR STEM TEACHERS IS PAY. ARE GOOD CAN YOU SUMMARIZE THE. THE ATTEMPTS AND THE. SUCCESS OR FAILURES OF OF PASS ATTEMPTS TO. TO PROVIDE MORE PAY FOR. SPECIAL ED AND STEM TEACHERS. AND. I THINK DISTRICTS TRY IN SOME INSTANCES SO I THINK THAT SOMEONE COMMON FOR DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE. A A SIGNING BONUS OR AND AN ANNUAL STIPEND OF SAY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH IS A SMALL BOOST. SO I THINK THERE ARE TRYING TO WORK WITH THEIR UNIONS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO SOME COMPENSATION. BUT IT HASN'T BEEN RUNOFF. AND I THINK THERE'S A CULTURE A BED OF RESISTANCE BECAUSE OF. WANTING TO BE TREATED THE SAME AS YOUR NEIGHBOR WHO WAS IN THE THIRD GRADE CLASSROOM AND YOU'RE RIGHT NEXT DOOR IN THE FOURTH GRADE GRADE CLASSROOM. I THINK SOME OF THAT AGAIN WE CAN APPRECIATE BUT SOME IS THAT THE PERSON IN THE ROOM NEXT YOU MIGHT BE DOING OF FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS FOR A GOOD CHUNK OF THE DAY AND ARE WORKING MORE OVERTIME AND OR HAVING A CASELOAD. THAT EVEN THE TEACHER NEXT DOOR WOULD CONSIDER I DON'T WANT THAT CASE LOAD RIGHT AND WE DON'T HAVE RULES LIKE LET'S JUST SHUFFLE STUDENTS TO READ TEACHERS AROUND SO THOUGH MOVE FROM SPECIAL ED INTO GENERAL AND. SO I THINK IT JUST STONE MAYBE AS. CONTINUING TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION WHAT DO UNIONS FIND REASONABLE WHAT KIND DISTRICTS AND UNIONS IN MORE CREATIVE OR DIFFERENT WAYS THINK ABOUT. A LONGER TERM MORE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO HOW THEY. DO THESE NEGOTIATIONS AND I REALIZE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS MODEST BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT SIGNAL RIGHT NOW THE STATE SETS THE DEFAULT. AND I THINK THAT DEFAULT CREATES A CLIMATE AND NOT COULD AGAIN IN A SMALL WAY BE CHANGED AND MAYBE OVER THE COURSE OF A NUMBER OF YEARS DISTRICT CONVERSATIONS BUT START CHANGING I THINK THEIR SONS. PERCOLATING YOU HEAR ABOUT DISTRICTS EVERY SO OFTEN TRYING MORE SUBSTANTIAL THINGS THE STATE IN THE PROCESS TRIED ONE TIME THREE MILLION DOLLAR ALTERNATIVE COMPENSATION COME TO THE STATE WILL GIVE YOU SOME PLANNING MONEY TO SIT DOWN WITH YOUR. UNION AND TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS WHICH AGAIN SEEMS SO REASONABLE THAT HASN'T WE DON'T WE GOT VIRTUALLY NO TAKERS THE LAST TIME STATE TRIED THIS SO I THINK IT GIVES YOU AN INDICATION ABOUT THE THE CULTURE. AND MAKING IT BUT AGAIN I DON'T THINK IT'S INSURMOUNTABLE I THINK PEOPLE CAN GET ON THE SAME PAGE IN YOUR PRIORITY YOU CAN SING SIGNAL PRIORITIES THAT MIGHT BE VERY SIMILAR TO THE PRIORITIES IN THE FIELD AND IT JUST TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF PERSISTENCE CREATIVITY IT FIGURE OUT. HOW TO DO IT WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT WHICH RIGHTS? I'M AND IT WAS BEFORE THE RECESSION SO I'M I'M GOING TO GET THE YEAR I SUSPECT WRONG BUT IT WAS LIKE FIVE SIX TWO THOUSAND FIVE SIX. OKAY. SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OFTEN. WE'RE GONNA GO BACK NOW AND THAT WILL FIRST WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ROLE. ESTABLISH A QUORUM. IT'S MCCARTY HERE HAVE IT HERE. LIMON HERE MEDINA. MERCY JETER. O'DONNELL. VOEPEL. WELL CHAIR IT'S ABOUT FELT TELL. YOU AREAS OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM AND WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA. LOOK FOR A MOTION ON THE VOTE ONLY ITEMS THESE ARE ISSUES ONE AND TWO.

HAS HAD VOTER SUPPORT TO CREATE THE WEST ACKERMAN A HOME RUN. IN ORDER TO INCREASE COLLEGE COMPLETION AND CREATE AN EXPECTATION FROM PRESCHOOL ON WORK THAT EVERY RESIDENT IS GOING TO ATTENDED COMPLETE SOME FORM OF POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. THE HOME RUN INITIATIVE IS FUNDED BY MEASURE E.. A BALLOT INITIATIVE WHICH WAS PASSED NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN BY SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR ELECTORATE.

IT IS THE CITY'S GOAL TO BUILD UPON THAT INITIAL DEPOSIT SO THAT EVERYONE SACRAMENTO STUDENT HAS SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO PURSUE THEIR POST SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL GOALS. WHILE SETTING THE STAGE FOR SOME FORM OF INCENTIVE MATCH. THE EVERY KID COUNTS PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE OPERATION AND EXPANSION OF COLLEGE STUDENTS ACCOUNT PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE CITY OF WAS SACRAMENTO SUPPORTIVE THE INCLUSION OF A VARIETY OF ELIGIBLE EXPENDITURES FOR LOCAL PROGRAMS. THAT ARE AWARDED MONEY FROM THE EVERY KID COUNTS PROGRAM AS LAWSUIT LOCAL INITIATIVES SUCH AS OURS. HAVE A DIVERSE SET OF PRIORITIES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PROGRAMMATIC SUCCESS AND GROWTH INCLUDING INCENTIVE GRANTS OUTREACH AND ONE TIME ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS SUCH AS LOCAL DATA SYSTEMS CREATION FOR LONGITUDINAL EVALUATION. WHILE LARGER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SUCH AS LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO AND OAKLAND HAVE CREATED OR AND THE PROCESS OF CREATING COSTUMES ACCOUNT PROGRAMS. SELECT A STRESSED THE SUBCOMMITTEE THE CAPACITY OF SMALLER MUNICIPALITIES SUCH AS THE CITY OF WEST SACRAMENTO WITH A POPULATION OF FIFTY THOUSAND. A TO DELIVER ON CULTS IN HIS ACCOUNT PROGRAMS. AND I I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE EVERY KID COUNTS ARE IF INCLUDE LANGUAGE THAT PRIORITIZES FUNDING PROGRAMS IN MUNICIPALITIES OF VARIOUS SIZES ACROSS STATE. I WOULD PARTICULARLY LIKE TO THANK CHAIRMAN CARI. FOR HIS ROLE IN ADVANCING THE EVERY KID COUNTS ACT AS WELL AS HIS LEADERSHIP AND ADVANCING EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION CT IT'S BECAUSE OF INVESTMENTS IN THOSE AREAS THAT WERE SACRAMENTO CAN EFFECTIVELY LEVERAGE OUR LOCAL SALES TAX REVENUE PROVIDING INNER AN ARRAY OF PROGRAMS TO PREPARE LOCAL WORK FORCE FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER. WHAT'S ACKERMAN A STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE ONGOING WORK OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT A COMMISSION TO LOOK FOR TO THE RELEASE OF THE RFA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND OTHERS NO ACTION ITEM ON THIS BUT WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAD IT HAD A REPORT BACK SINCE WE DID. CUT IT SHIP WITH OUR PLAN FROM LAST YEAR. GOING TO THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THE TREASURER'S OFFICE AND OUT STUDENT COMMISSION. AND DIE I'LL JUST REITERATE WHAT WHAT YOU ALL SAID THIS IS ON THE THINK CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IF ONE FOCUS ON EDUCATION. OUTCOMES IN HIGHER EDUCATION THE COST OF CALLS SHE'S IS ISLAM ON EVERYONE'S MIND IN. AND RESEARCH IS CRYSTAL CLEAR GAS MILEAGE DOLLARS IN YOUR NAME. THERE ARE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MEANING YOU STILL. THE ODDS ARE ARE ARE EQUAL THAT YOU WILL GO ON TO COLLEGE IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN YOUR NAME FOCUSING ON YOUR HIGHER EDUCATION FUTURE AND SO. I THINK CALIFORNIA TO BE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN DO THIS ALL ACROSS. OUR STATE WE HAVE YOU KNOW THOUSAND CITIES ARE SO BUT WE NEED TO START SOMEWHERE AND SO I THINK IT'S IT'S A IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE CITIES THAT ARE DOING IT. MEAN BRING IN MORE UP TO SCALE AND HAVE A HAVE A. THE A ROADMAP FOR OTHER JURISDICTIONS AS WELL. SO I AND I I DO HAVE MAYBE A COUPLE LOGISTICS QUESTIONS AND SO. YOU WAS SACRAMENTO'S IS LAUNCHING THEIR SOUND. CITY SACRAMENTO WE HAVE A SMALLER ONE HERE THAT AND NONPROFIT NOT DESTROY THE CITY IS PARTICIPATING SO. IF YOU THINK SO HAVE HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THAT SMALL CITIES IN LARGE CITIES AS AS AS WE DID NOT NOTICE KNOWS HERE. ARE OUT CAN THERE ARE OTHER GROUPS WHO ARE DOING IT IN A CITY ARE THEY ABLE TO PARTICIPATE YEARS IT JUST THAT THE CITY GOVERNMENT OR THE COUNTY. AND THEN. THIRDLY. WHAT TYPE OF THE OF MATCH ARE GONNA REQUIRE FOR THE JURISDICTION IF ANY AT ALL? SURE I'D TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION. I THINK IT'S KEY THAT BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THE RFA. THIS TO NAY COMMISSION LEVERAGE SOME PARTNERSHIPS WITH ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS LEAVE CALIFORNIA CITIES THAT COUNTY SUPERVISOR ASSOCIATION SO FORTH TO GET THE WORD OUT SO THAT ALL. CITIES OR COUNTIES. THAT THAT OPERATE OR ARE IN DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A PROGRAM ARE AWARE OF IT SO I GUESS THAT'S REALLY KEY IN AND WE LOOK% FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM. APART IS THE LEGISLATURE ON THAT AS WELL. WITH REGARDS TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION I'M I BELIEVE THE LANGUAGE THE BILL DOES PROVIDE THAN ELIGIBLE NONPROFIT THAT OPERATES A PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR REGION. IS ELIGIBLE TO APPLY. AND AS I MENTIONED A VERY BEEN A TOUCH OF ONE OF THEM BUT I'M OF COURSE WILL CONTINUE WORK WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND. AND. ANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WERE AWARE OF TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ALSO AWARE OF IT AND THEN I AM I DON'T BELIEVE. IF MEMORY SERVES I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE A LANGUAGE OF THE BILL IN FRONT OF ME I DON'T BELIEVE IT BAIT REQUIRED IN THAT SPECIFICALLY IN THE STATUTE. STANDARD PRACTICE THINK FOCUSES ON THERE MUST BE RESOURCES COMING CORRECT THEN THEY CAN'T ALL BE THE STATE COMING IN AND THAT ANGER ACTORS PROGRAM YES SO. AYE IF IT IT ENDORSES THE GENERAL CONCEPT OF THE MATCH. IN CONTRACTS OF THIS NATURE THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ENGAGED IN WE'VE TYPICALLY ASK FOR EITHER A ONE TO ONE OR SOMETIMES A ONE ONE AND A HALF TO ONE MATCH SUCH AS WITH OUR. CALVET SOAP OUR CONSORTIA BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT AS WE DEVELOP THE RFA WE WANT TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING THAT. CAN HAVE AN IMPACT IT WILL BE OVERTLY BURDENSOME SURE ON CITY SO I DON'T THINK WE'VE COME TO A DECISION ON THAT YET WE'D WE'D DO I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT YOU KNOW THE INTENT OF THE BILL THERE'D BE SOME FUNDS ALREADY. NOT THE LOCAL BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE WANT TO MAKE IT SO STRENUOUS ON THEM THAT. THAT IT'S NOT WORTH THEIR TIME BRIDGES TO APPLY YES. AND AGAIN OF COURSE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS AN IDEA FACTORY AND. WE'LL HAVE LARGE IDEAS. IT'S AND SOMETIMES IT THERE ARE HARD TO DEFERRED JUST LOGISTICS PURPOSES AND FOR MONEY IT RIGHT AWAY AND SO. STARTING SMALL I THINK IT IS IT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE AND. WE'RE NOT ALONE HIS OTHER STATES HAVE DONE THIS OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE GLOBE SO. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON OUR OUR YOUTH AND OUR FUTURE AS FAR AS HIGHER EDUCATION. OUTCOMES I I WANNA MAYBE ASK I WEST SACRAMENTO SO IF IF YOU WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE THIS THAT. THIS THAT THIS AWARD THIS GRANT. WOULD WOULD YOU. IN IT EXPAND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO GIVE THAT THE. THE. SAVINGS ACCOUNT TO KINDA YOU MENTIONED ONLY STUDENTS WHO GO THROUGH YOUR. CITY OF SACK UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. AND THAT'S A FINITE NUMBER OR DO YOU. GIVE UP THE HIGHER AMOUNTS IN THE STARTER ACCOUNT. OR R. OR OTHER THINGS THAT THAT YOU'D LIKE TO DO. WE WOULD NEED TOUGH FIRST GIVE A PROPOSAL FOR COUNCIL CONSIDERATION BEFORE WE WENT TO EXPANSION BUT COUNSEL HAS ALREADY STATED THERE. INTERESTS AND. POLICY DIRECTION ON BEING ABLE TO HAVE ACCURATE EVALUATION. WE THINK THE INCLUSION OF ONE TIME ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS SUCH AS CREATING A ROBUST DATA SYSTEMS INTEGRATION TO BE ABLE TO TRACK OF STUDENTS SUCCESS OVER TIME. THE INITIATIVE IS DESIGNED AS SUCH. BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT TO PRESCHOOL AND KINDERGARTEN BETWEEN. CD  <u><c.green>PATHWAYS AND</c></u> INTERNSHIPS SO COUNCIL'S BEEN FIRM ON. MAINTAINING THAT ONE WOULD ONLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT IF YOU'VE COMPLETED A. CITY GUARANTEED HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WITHIN THE CITY. BUT. COUNCIL IS VERY INTERESTED IN. INCENTIVE MATCH PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT INCREASES PARENT INVOLVEMENT AND. LIKELIHOOD OF. USING THEIR CULT SAVINGS ACCOUNT. IN IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE SPECIFICALLY. BUT WE ARE KEENLY INTERESTED. IN. USING POTENTIAL. LEVERED RIPPLE I GRANT FUNDS ON THE DATA SYSTEMS EVALUATION PIECE WAS. SURE I THINK THAT RAISES A GOOD POINT BECAUSE IF THIS WORKS LONGITUDINALLY. IF YOU LOOK TEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD LIKE THAT KINDERGARTENERS AND ARE ISSUE JUST LIKE TO WANT PEOPLE TO SAVE FOR THEIR RETIREMENT IS TODAY START TODAY WE WANNA GET MASS. THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WERE THINKING ABOUT THIS KNOWING. THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THE COSTS ARE JUST TREMENDOUS AND JUST THE STICKER SHOCK FOR SO MANY PEOPLE TODAY. IT ALONE A DECADE FROM NOW SO. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WHAT ARE OUR OUR GOAL THIS IS IT IMMEDIATE. A SATURATION THE PEOPLE PARTICIPATING OR BUILDING IT FOR LONG TERM SUCCESS SO BUT THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT WILL BE A SORT OUT THAT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH WITH YOU AND OTHER. GRANTEES THREAT CALIFORNIA NEAR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THIS IS INFORMATIONAL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSSES TODAY. OKAY WE WILL GO BACK TO ISSUE NUMBER. THREE. THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. SCHOOL FACILITIES AND SO I ED JENNIFER CAN AGAIN LEDGE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS GOING TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON WHAT'S HAPPENED TO DATE. SO YOU KNOW PROP FIFTY ONE WAS APPROVED NOVEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN INCLUDED SEVEN BILLION FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES. LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST AUTHORIZATION OF BOND SALES THE STATE APPROVED FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR MILLION AND PROP FIFTY ONE FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS. IS UP ACTIVELY ON A TWELVE YEAR EXPENDITURE PLAN. THE STATE HAD GONE AGAIN FROM TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SIX TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WITHOUT A STATE BONDS SO THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL ON NUMBER OF SCHOOL FACILITY PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE. IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR MILLION IN BONDS THEY ALSO CAN STAIN ON THE TWELVE YEAR PLAN EFFECTIVELY. AND I THINK YOU COULD TAKE ONE OF TO APPROACH US OR ONE OF TWO VIEWS OF THE SITUATION AND SO ON THE ONE HAND MOST SCHOOLS THEY GO AHEAD AND UNDERTAKE THEIR PROJECTS EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE STATE CASH IN HAND. NOT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN BUT MOST MED ON LARGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN THEY JUST GO AHEAD AND DO THE PROJECT USED THEIR LOCAL DEAL BOND MONEY TO FUND THE CASH WAIT FOR THE STATE CASH REIMBURSED THEIR LOCAL COFFERS. SO IF YOU'RE NOT CONCERNED WITH THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND STICKING AT THE STATE LEVEL THE PROCESS APPLICATIONS ARE DISTRICTS WAITING. MONTHS YEARS TO GET THE STATE REIMBURSEMENT THEN YOU COULD JUST GO AHEAD AND ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IF YOU'RE CONCERNED NOT SCHOOLS WE'VE GOT A LOT OF PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE AT THE STATE LEVEL THE STATE'S BEING ESPECIALLY SLOW TO FUND THEM. UNDER THE BOND MEASURE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED SO IF YOU'RE CONCERNED IN THIS REGARD IF THIS IS YOUR VIEW OF THE SITUATION. YOU COULD FIND MANY MORE PROJECTS OF THIS YEAR. SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADOPT THE FIVE YEAR PLAN AS OPPOSED TO THE TWELVE YEAR EXPENDITURE PLAN IF YOU DID THAT YOU WOULD BE GIVING OUT MORE LIKE ONE AND A HALF BILLION A YEAR AS OPPOSED TO A FIVE HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. SO WE CHAT WE LOOKED INTO OPSEU STAFF IN THERE ARE THE ONES THAT LOOK AT THE APPLICATIONS AND STAFF THEM AND WE THINK IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE THIS LATTER APPROACH BE ON A FIVE YEAR PLAN ONE AND A HALF BILLION A YEAR. OPSEU HOW STAFF TO DO IT. THEY'VE GOT FIFTY TWO FULL TIME POSITIONS NOW. THEY USE SEVEN OF THESE IN THE COURT THEY USE SEVEN OF THESE IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS AND THEY HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO GO UP TO TIME POSITIONS. IN THE BUDGET YEAR. SO THE FORTY TWO OTHER POSITIONS ARE DOING APPEALS WORK SOMEHOW REACH CLOSING OUT SOME AUDIT WORK AS YOU MIGHT RECALL LAST YEAR YOU MADE A DECISION TO TAKE STATE AUDITING OF PROJECTS AND DEVOLVE IT SO THE AUDITING FUNCTIONS NOW AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WHEN YOU DID THAT YOU. DIDN'T REDUCE OPSEU STAFF I'M IN A TANDEM ACTION. WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT THE ON AVERAGE PERSON I'M A FULL TIME PERSON OVER IT OPS THE IS PROCESSING ONE POINT FOUR APPLICATIONS PER MONTH? SO WE SAT DOWN WITH OPSEU TO SAY WHAT'S ENTAILED IN AN APPLICATION REVEAL AND WE THINK THAT COULD RECENTLY DONE BE DONE MORE QUICKLY. SO WE RAN AN ESTIMATE FOR YOU WE SAID WELL WHAT IF THEY WERE TO USE TWELVE PEOPLE ON THE BUDGET YEAR RATHER THAN PAN. AND WHAT IF THEY WERE TO PROCESS TO APPLICATIONS PER MONTH RATHER THAN ONE POINT FOUR SO I WOULD ARGUE A VERY MODEST THAT OF ASSUMPTIONS BUT IF THAT'S ALL YOU ASSUME TWELVE FULL TIME POSITIONS DURING TWO APPLICATIONS A MONTH. THEY WOULD ON AVERAGE PROCESS ONE AND HALF BILLION I MEAN NOT ON AVERAGE BUT THEY WERE PROCESS ONE AND A HALF BILLION NEXT YEAR. SO WE THINK IT'S NOT A STAFFING ISSUE. THAT YOU COULD AGAIN RECENTLY PROCESS. SUBSTANTIALLY MORE IF YOU WANTED TO DO MORE THAN ONE POINTFIVE BUT ONE POINT FIVE WOULD PUT YOU ON THE FIVE YEAR. GOOD MORNING SURELY DOUBT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PERCEIVE ME THE BUDGET AFTER TWENTY SEVENTEEN INCLUDED ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES FOR THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM AS A CONDITION OF RELEASING BOND FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM. SINCE ENACTMENT THE STATE ALLOCATION OR DISAPPROVE GRANT AGREEMENTS AND AUDIT STRUCTURES WERE DEVELOPED FOR LOCAL AUDITOR'S TO COMPLETE INDEPENDENT PERFORMANCE AUDITS TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM COMPLIANCE. THIS YEAR'S GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION. AND PROGRAM CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON PROCESSING APPLICATION AS WELL AS PROVIDING OUTREACH ASSISTANCE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WITHOUT HAPPY TAKING QUESTIONS. A PRIVATE EDUCATION. THEN. STEP AROUND THE OFFICE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM GULLIKSON AND THIS THE SUPERINTENDENT STRONGLY SUPPORTED THAT THE BOND PROPOSAL I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. REALLY AS WE THINK ABOUT FACILITIES IT'S MORE THAN JUST THE PHYSICAL FOOTPRINT THAT IT REALLY IS IS. CRITICAL TO THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND TO A STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND SO WE WOULD THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT SPORTS ACCELERATING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL GETTING MORE BOND BOND FUNDS OUT FASTER. OUT OF THE OFFICE THAT PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. THIS ASSORTMENT. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ADDS LISA SO READ UP ON WE OPERATE THE PROGRAM FOR THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF THE. DEPARTMENT JAIL SERVICES AND STILL OCCASION BOARD SO WE OUR MAIN GOAL IS TO PROCESS GRANT APPLICATIONS THAT'S THAT'S TRUE THAT'S ONE OF OUR MISSIONS BUT THERE'S ALSO OTHER MISSIONS AND. IS A COMPLIANCE ROLL THERE'S ALSO A COUNTY ROLL-ON AND ALSO PROCESS REGULATIONS AS WELL. AS WELL AS APPEALS. AND THE VOTERS HAVE BEEN GRACIOUS TO PROVIDE FIVE. VOTER APPROVED INITIATIVES SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THAT HE CREATED TO FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. AND WE HAVE DISPERSED OVER THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IN PROGRAM FUNDS OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. SO OUR PRIMARY GOAL AS I MENTIONED ON MY TWENTY GIVE YOU A RECENT UPDATE AS FAR AS THE. PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE WAS A RECENT VOTER INITIATIVE THAT WAS APPROVED IN NOVEMBER TWENTY. STEEN AND THAT PROVIDED SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PROGRAM ON THREE BILLION IN NEW CONSTRUCTION THREE BILLION A MODERNIZATION. AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN CHARTERS. SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM AND ALSO INCUR TECH EDUCATION PROGRAM. OUT OF THAT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IT WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS. WE ACTUALLY HAVE TAKEN ACTION. CLIENT AND WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS LAUGHED. IN THE PROGRAM AND THAT ALSO INCLUDES. SOME RESIDUAL FUNDS AND PRIOR PROGRAMS AS WELL. SO I DON'T PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE WE HAVE FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION LAUGHED OUT OF FOUR POINT TWO MILLION IN SEISMIC MITIGATION PROGRAM FUNDS. SIXTY FOUR AND A HALF MILLION ENTERED SCHOOL FUNDS A LITTLE POINT FOR AN OVERCROWDED RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM FUNDS TO OVER TWO POINT SIX. MILLET BILLION DOLLARS AND NEW CONSTRUCTION AND TWO POINT SIX BILLIONIN MODERNIZATION AND LIKEWISE CAREER TACK WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED NINE MILLION. AVAILABLE IN PROGRAM FUNDS AND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND. HARDSHIP FUNDS. WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE PROGRAM. STALE OCCASION BOARD AND I ALONG WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD WE WANTED TO PUT SOME ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IN PLACE. THERE'S A DISLODGED ESPECIALLY HOW WE START THE PROGRAM UP AGAIN. SO THE BOARD TOOK SOME SIGNIFICANT ACTION IN JUNE. OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THOSE ACTIONS HASN'T NOW LET THROUGH PATHWAY A PROCESSING PROJECT APPLICATIONS. SO IN TOTAL IN JUNE FIFTH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPROCESSED THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. IN PROJECT APPROVALS AND THESE ARE APPLICATIONS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION MODERNIZATION ON HIS PART OF TECH CAME IN THROUGH THE DOOR IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T HAVE BOND AUTHORITY. AND THE BOARD HAD AUTHORIZED AT THAT POINT IN TIME TO PROCESSES APPLICATIONS. SO. THOSE PROJECTS WERE EFFECTIVELY FUNDED ON JUNE FIFTH A TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY THE BOARD AND AGAIN THAT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE APPLICATIONS AT MOVED FORWARD. I ALSO WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THERE'S PROCESS IN OUR. OUR PROGRAM IS CALLED FACILITY HARDSHIP IN THIS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY PROJECTS WE HAVE PROCESS TWENTY FOR PROJECTS FROM JUST JULY FIRST TO DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THAT A CREATURE TWENTY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT ALSO INCLUDED SEISMIC MITIGATION PROGRAM FUNDS SO THOSE PROJECTS ARE PROCESS IN AN ACCELERATED MANNER AND SO THEY JUMPED INTO THE FRONT OF THE LIST. AND NOT PROCESS IN A DATE ORDER RECEIVE AND IN THE NORMAL PROGRAM SO THOSE ARE ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS THAT WE ALSO PROCESS. IN OUR HOUSE. I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TO THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM THERE WAS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED. FOR A PROGRAM FUNDS. THE FINALLY AROUND OPEN IN FEBRUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE HAD WITH BEEN OVERSUBSCRIBED IN THAT PROGRAM SO THERE WAS OVER THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN REQUEST THAT CAME IN FOR THAT FIVE AND A MILLIONS WHO IS VERY COMPETITIVE. PROCESS AND THOSE WORDS HAVE PROVIDED. A PRELIMINARY RESERVATION OF FUNDS FOR THIS PROGRAM FUNDS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY. OF DISPERSED OVER PRETTY CLOSE TO FOUR HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM FUNDS. AND THAT WAS EFFECTIVE JANUARY AND FEBRUARY. THERE IS ALSO SOME RESIDUAL FUNDS AND THE PRIOR PROGRAMS AND THOSE ARE ACTUALLY. APPROVED AS WELL. AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CURRENT CAREER CHECK EDUCATION FILING AROUND IT'S OPEN AND WILL BE PRESENTING SOME ITEMS TO THE BOARD AND THAT WILL CONSUME A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. AND THAT WILL BE COMING UP MATTER A FEW WEEKS. SO DISAPPEAR PERSPECTIVE OF HOW MANY SHOVEL READY PROJECTS WE HAVE PROCESS SINCE THE OF THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM UMPS HAVE SUPPORTED ACTION. WE HAVE PROCESS OVER EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN PROGRAM GRANTS IT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. AND ALSO WANT TO SHARE THAT OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION OF THAT. THAT THOSE PROJECTS. COMMITTED FLOOR FOR CHARTER PROGRAM. FOR THE PRELIMINARY RESERVATION OF THOSE PROGRAM FUNDS. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THIS DATE ORDER RECEIVED AS HOW WE PROCESS APPLICATIONS FOR CIVILITY HARDSHIP. ON WE PROCESS THOSE ON ACCELERATING MATTER USED AS OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY PROJECTS. I'M I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TO THERE'S. FILING ROUNDS FOR A CAREER TECH EDUCATION SO THOSE ARE OUR. VERY ROUND SPECIFIC AND SO WE MANAGE ALL THAT WORKLOAD INCLUDING THE APPEALS PROCESS AS WELL. AND I ALSO WANTED A HIGHLIGHT TO VERY QUICKLY. THAT THE BOARD. ALTHOUGH TAKING ACTION ON THESE PROJECTS. THERE WAS ACTUALLY A SPRING ON AND A FALL BOND SALE. THAT OCCURRED AND SO PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE DID HAVE SOME BOND PROCEEDS ALLOCATED. AS A RESULT OF THOSE PROGRAM GRANTS BEING AWARDED SO IN THE FALL TWENTY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED THIRTY ONE PROJECTS HAVE WERE APPROVED IN BOND PROCEEDS WERE SOLD ON THE OPEN MARKET SO THAT REPRESENTED OVER FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. GOING OUT TO PROJECTS AND THOSE OF THE PROJECTS THAT ALREADY HAD. THE WORD STE. APPROVED BY THE BOARD IN JUNE. AND I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IN SPRING OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN JUST TWO MONTHS AGO. WE HAD NINETY PROJECTS APPROVED AND THAT WAS A HUNDRED NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AND AGAIN THESE ARE THE PROJECTS THAT HAD A BOARD APPROVAL PRIOR. FROM JULY FIRST THROUGH UP UNTIL THE EARLY PART IN DECEMBER SO I BOND PROCEEDS HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR THE PROGRAM I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT TO YOU. SO AS A RESULT WE I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT WE HAVE I THINK YOU GIVE YOU THE STATISTICS EARLIER WE HAVE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PRESENTING. IN MARCH AND ALSO. THROUGH THOSE PROJECTS ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR. SOME BOND PROCEEDS TO AS COME TO FALL NAY AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAD OVER TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF. NEW CONSTRUCTION MODERNIZATION PROGRAM PROJECTS THAT ARE READY FOR THE APPROVAL. AND STARS HAVE A MATCH CASH PROCEEDS AVAILABLE. A BUT I ALSO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IMPORTANT NOTE I KNOW THERE IS A MENTION ABOUT OUR WORKLOAD WE DO HAVE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING WORK LOAD. AND THEY HAVE BEEN THE WORKLOAD SINCE WE WEREN'T WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROCESS THE PROGRAM GRANTS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO. BOND AUTHORITY AVAILABLE SO SENSE AND. THERE HAD BEEN ACCUMULATION OF PROJECTS ON THAT WORKLOAD WE HAVE IN PROCESSING THOSE. PROJECTS THAT WERE REPRESENT NEW CONSTRUCTION MODERNIZATIONON A DATE ORDER RECEIVE. BASES. AND SO CURRENTLY WE HAVE AS OF APRIL THIRTIETH OVER THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. AND PROJECTS IN OUR WORKLOAD LIST CURRENTLY. AND THAT REPRESENTS THREE HUNDRED CITY SEVERAL PROJECTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND SIX HUNDRED CITY FOR PROJECTS. AND MODERNIZATION. AND SO THAT EQUATES TO OVER A THOUSAND FIFTY ONE GRANTS ARE AWAITING I'M ON OUR CURRENT WORKLOAD RIGHT NOW. WITH THAT I WANTED TO HAND OVER THE MIKE TO. MY COLLEAGUE BERNARD CAN'T MINOR AND SHE CAN TALK ABOUT A CURRENT STUFF. THANK YOU. IF I RECANT MINOR THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. AND JUST WANTED TO BREAK DOWN OUR STAFFING ALLOCATIONS FOR YOU JUST TO GET A SENSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR. EXISTENCE OFTEN WHO IS ABLE TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS BUT. I'M AS WAS MENTIONED WE HAVE FIFTY TWO STAFF THAT SHOW ON OUR ORG CHART RIGHT NOW. AND IF YOU EXCLUDE OUR EXECUTIVE POSITIONS ARE AUDIT FOLKS ARE IN A DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION THAT IS GEARED TOWARDS AUDITING PROJECTS. AND OUR ACCOUNTING STAFF THAT ARE COVERING AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM AND HUNDRED FIFTY NINE FUNDS AND SUB FUNDS AND. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A AT MAXIMUM TWENTY ONE. ANALYSTS THAT WOULD BE IN A CLASSIFICATION APPROPRIATE FOR PROCESSING APPLICATIONS. AND A THAT ARE COUNT RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE THIRTEEN OF THE TWENTY ONE OR SIXTY TWO PERCENT BETTER. AIMS OUT PROCESSING APPLICATIONS WITH THAT THAT. APPLICATIONS BEING BOTH NEW CONSTRUCTION AND MODERNIZATION OUR FACILITY HARDSHIP HEALTH AND SAFETY PROGRAM CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES THE INTAKE PROCESS FOR ALL THE APPLICATIONS THAT CAN MEN. AS WELL AS APPEALS AND WE COUNT APPEALS AS APPLICATION PROCESSING BECAUSE WITHOUT THE APPEAL COMPONENT THAT ITEM CANNOT ACTUALLY GO FORWARD FOR BOARD APPROVAL SO WE NEED SOMEBODY TO PROCESS THE APPEAL. IN ORDER FOR THE FUNDING TO ACTUALLY GO OUT. SO THAT LEAVES US WITH AIDS AND AND JUST WANTED TO BREAK DOWN THAT THOSE OTHER EIGHT POSITIONS ARE USED FOR GRAND AGREEMENTS WHICH I COULD MAKE A CASE. AS PART OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND IN A CRITICAL FUNCTION. AND. TWO POSITIONS FOR A POLICY ITEMS FROM THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FISCAL YEAR IS A VERY HEAVY YEAR FOR POLICY AND INCLUDE ALL THE CHANGES THAT. ARE HAPPENING IN THE PROGRAM. AND. THREE FOLKS THAT SERVE IN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE BUSINESS SERVICES SPECIAL PROJECTS FROM THOSE FOLKS HANDLE THE REGULATION PACKAGES THAT WE DO PROCESS ONCE THE BOARD TAKES POLICY ACTION. OUR ENTIRE COMMUNICATIONS FUNCTION WHICH INCLUDES THE MAINTENANCE OF OUR WEBSITE MAKING SURE THINGS ARE ACCEPTABLE TO STAKEHOLDERS. OTHER STATE ALLOCATION BOARD AGENDA AND OR FILE ROOM MAILROOM BUDGETS HR AT SIGGRAPH. AND THEN WE DO HAVE TWO POSITIONS THE EQUIVALENT OF TWO POSITIONS THAT WORK TOWARDS THE OUT REACH AND SERVICES WITH OUR SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO THAT AND IS THE BREAKDOWN OF OUR CURRENT STAFFING SO WE WE DO FEEL THAT WE ARE TRYING TO FOCUS ON. ALL OF OUR CORE FUNCTIONS AND PROCESSING THE APPLICATIONS AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE STATE ALLOCATION BURDEN KEEPING THE PROGRAM RUNNING. M.. HINTS THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU. THAT. I BELIEVE COMPLETES THE PRESENTATION. QUESTION. I DO HAVE A A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FIRST TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. A I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST YEAR WE WERE HERE ASKING. THE GOVERNOR ABOUT THE. NUMBER PROJECTS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. MY CORRECT. ON PROP FIFTY ONE. MY. I THAT MY COLLEAGUE EL THE FOR HER FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES OKAY YEAH DEPARTMENT IF YOU COULD. COME FORWARD. I. SO SO MY QUESTION THAT I THINK LAST YEAR WHEN WE WERE. LOOKING AT PROP FIFTY ONE IN THE RELEASE IN OF OF THAT THE SALE OF THE BONDS IN THE NUMBER PROJECTS. IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WERE LIKE TWENTY. PROJECTS THAT HAD BEEN APPROVED. BUT THE BUT THE GOVERNOR WAS SLOW AND ALLOCATING OR LEADING THAT. DOES GO OUT TO THE OTHER PROJECTS THAT THERE WERE ONLY LIKED WELL. MY MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY UPWARDS OF HE SAID WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF FACILITIES. THOSE ARE PROCESS AT THOSE APPLICATIONS ARE REVIEWED BY OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY ANALYSTS AND THE. OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION SHEPHERD SO SEPARATE ISSUES OKAY BUT THEY ARE BOTH PROP FIFTY ONE. THAT THE TWO BILLIONS COMING OUT OF THERE YES WELL. SO CAN YOU ADDRESS I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE NOT THE FOLKS THAT ARE DOING IT I GET A. CAN WE CAN YOU DRESS HOW WE'RE DOING IN MAKING PROGRESS. IN THAT IN ALLOCATING THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND I WOULD DEFER TO OUR AYE CAPITAL OUTLAY ANALYSTS THAT ARE NOT PRESENT WHO. ARE LEADING THE PACK SOMEBODY CAN ATTRACTED ME ON THAT AYE I AM DIDN'T COULDN'T BUDGET ANALYST I DO THINK YOU'LL HEAR MUCH MORE AT ANOTHER HEARING BUT THERE WERE I THINK YOUR MEMORY IF I RECALL SERVE YOU CORRECTLY LAST YEAR VIC CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE APPROVED TWENTY NINE PROJECTS. THE GOVERNOR GAVE YOU FIVE IN JANUARY LEGISLATURE EXPRESSED SOME FRUSTRATION GAVE YOU MORE AND THE MAY REVISION AND I THINK THAT LANDED ON SOMETHING LIKE TWELVE SO THOSE TWELVE HAVE MOVED FORWARD. THE GOVERNOR CAME BACK THIS YEAR. LARGELY WHAT YOU FUNDED BLASTER WAS PULMONARY PLANS SO YOU FUNDED THE WORKING DRAWINGS ON THOSE TWELVE TO CONTINUE ADVANCING THROUGH THE PIPELINE AND THEN YOU ADDED. I I THINK ANOTHER FIVE SOME FOUR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. SAID IT'S STILL A BIT OF A MODEST PLAN SO JUST AS HE HAS WHEN I ADMIRE CHARACTERIZE AS A MODEST PLAN ON THE KEY TWELVE SIDE TO JUST DO. SIX HUNDRED MILLION OF SEVEN BILLION IT'S THE SAME SORT OF MODEST PLAN ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. HE'S ACTUALLY TRICKLING OUT THE MONEY A LITTLE BIT MORE SLOWLY ON THE COLLEGE SIDE BECAUSE HE'S DOING IT IN PHASES WHICH IS WHAT WE CHURCH TRADITIONALLY RECOMMEND YOU DO YOU FIND THE PLANNER PLANS GET A GOOD ESTIMATE DO WORKING TRYING TO GET AN EVEN BETTER ESTIMATE OF CONSTRUCTION. THEN FONG CONSTRUCTION ONCE THEY GET THERE THAT'S THE APPROACH THAT FINANCING YOU HAVE BEEN TAKING ON THAT COLLEGE SIDE BUT YACHTS ALL COMING OUT OF PROP FIFTY ONE. SO ORIGINALLY THERE WERE. AROUND TWENTY APPROVED. AND NOW. SOMEWHERE IN THERE THE GOVERNOR IS NOW MOVED TO. HOW MANY THAT ARE BEING FUNDED YEAH SO HIS ADVANCING ALL THE PROJECTS LAST YEAR AND I I'M FORGETTING BUT HE ADDED AT LEAST FIVE THAT MIGHT OF BEEN MORE THIS YEAR OF? TOTALLY NEW PROJECTS WHERE HE'S FUNDING THE FIRST DAY DEPLOYMENT PLANS TO GET AS TO WHAT NUMBER. I YOU KNOW THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THIS LOS I WAS A NUMBER PROJECTS. I THINK ONLY BITS. I DO THINK IT'S ONLY LIKE FIVE PROJECTS. GOOD SO FAR A YACHT AND THOSE FIVE PROJECTS BECAUSE IT'S ONLY PRELIMINARY PLANS THAT WOULD BE NEWLY ADDED IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THEY THEY TOTAL LIKE TONS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT'S A LOW PRICE TAG BECAUSE THE PLANNER PLANS IS OBVIOUSLY. A NOT AN EXPENSIVE COMPONENT OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS EXTENSIVE COMPONENT ITS CONSTRUCTION AND AND THE BONDS WOULD WOULD. HAVE TO BE THE NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR SAY THAT STAY ON COMMUNITY COLLEGE WOULD HAVE TO BE USED BY WHEN. I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS ANY STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THE STATE CAN BE ON THE FIVE YEAR PLAN THE TWELVE YEAR PLAN THE TWENTY YEAR PLAN. AYE WE DIDN'T EMPHASIZE THAT TODAY BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME BONDS WAY BACK FROM THE FOR TWO THOUSAND SIX WHERE MONEY AS. AND IN THESE CASES WHERE MONEY IS VERY OLD MORE THAN TEN YEARS OLD THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS GRANTED FOR PROJECT THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE PROCESS GOT RESCINDED. FLOWED BACK TO THE STATE AND OUR REPURPOSE XENA. I'M THIS IS JUST A SECOND TAKE A VERY LONG TIME BUT THERE'S NO LEGAL DEADLINE UPON WIN ALL THE BONDS MUST BE SOLD. AND THEN TO THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION. I HEARD YOU MENTION THE. SAFETY AND HOW. THAT KINDA GET EXPIATE IT. CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT NOW IF OTHER PROJECTS ARE IN THE QUEUE IN THE LINE. TO BE FUNDED. AND THE OTHER PROJECTS. THAT HAVE THE. EXPEDIA ADDED SAFETY OUT. I GET FUNDED AHEAD OF THEM. COULD SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT WERE IN LINE FALAH. NOT WERE NOT GETTING FUNDED NOT CURRENTLY AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ENOUGH ON THE THIRTY TWO PROCESS IS HEALTH AND SAFETY PROJECTS. AND EVEN WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE PROGRAM FUNDS BEFORE PROP FIFTY ONE WAS PASSED. OUT THERE IS RESIDUAL FUNDS EVER COMING BACK IN THE PROGRAM AS A RESULT OF COMPLIANCE REVIEWS RECISIONS AND CLOSEOUTS. I AM SO AND ACTUALLY PAYMENTS AS WELL BECAUSE OF SOME COMPONENTS OF OUR PROGRAM THAT ACTUALLY HAS A REPAYMENT PROCESS. AND SO AS PROGRAM FUNDS ARE COMING IN. WE WERE ABLE TO. STILL PROCESS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY PROJECTS ON A FIRST COME FIRST. ORDER BASIS BUT THEY WERE XCELERATED THAT'S TRUE AND THAT'S A REGULATION THAT THE BOARD HAS ADOPTED. SEVERAL YEARS AGO SO THAT WAS THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY WANT TO APPROACH. PROCESSING ARE PROJECTS. I I I DID HEAR CONCERN FROM A SCHOOL DISTRICT IN MY AREA. THAT HAD BEEN IN LINE. AND AND THEN WAS NOT. THE FEAR WAS THAT THEY WOULDN'T. BE FUNDED BECAUSE OTHER PROJECTS WOULD TAKE THE PRESIDENT'S AND SO THEY WOULD BE. IN LINE ONE YEAR BUT MAY HAVE DROPPED OFF FOR FOLLOWING YEARS. YEAH CURRENTLY WE HAVE SUFFICIENT BOND AUTHORITY TO COVER PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN LINE. MAYBE AT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT MAY BE IN THE AUDIENCE THERE AND I'M SURE I'M GONNA BE HEARING FROM THEM. THAT WE HAVE A MEETING LATER THIS AFTERNOON TO TALK ABOUT JUST THAT. SO I I HOPE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO PASS. THAT. NOT SURE IF. YOU KNOW I AND AND I BELIEVE IT SENATE SAID NO CORRECT. NO. VAL VERDE. VAL VERDE. HAD EXPRESSED CONCERNS. ON THOSE LINES. BUT THANK YOU ANDA AND IF THEY HAVE MORE QUESTIONS WE CAN GET BACK WITH YOU CRACKS ILLEGALLY. AND I GUESS THAT'S IT. ALRIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. X. ISSUE IS. ISSUE FOR WELCOME AND. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ACTIVE MORNING AGAIN SURELY DIE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWENTY POINT THREE MILLION FOR THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM. PROPOSE ADDITIONAL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WILL CAP THE LEAST GROWTH AT THE RATE OF COLA FOR THE PROGRAM. IT ALSO REQUIRES INDEPENDENT APPRAISAL SPRING YOU CHARTER SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLS ARE EXISTING BUT EXPANDING FACILITIES. WHILE ALSO PRIOR TO RAISING. LEASE COSTS FOR OTHER MEANS OVER OTHER MAINTENANCE COSTS WHEN THE PROGRAM IS OVERSUBSCRIBED. IT ALSO ELIMINATES THE BACK THE REQUIREMENT TO FIND PRIOR COSTS WITH THE CURRENT YEAR APPROPRIATION. ANY PROPOSED INTEND TO ALIGN FUNDING WITH A PROJECTED PROGRAMMATIC PARTICIPATION WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT LIMITED FUNDING IS SUPPORTED BY ACTUAL COSTS THAT REFLECT CURRENT MARKET RATES. WITHOUT OF HAPPY TAKING QUESTIONS. THEY COULD. WE'RE GONNA IT JUST DOESN'T STOP FOR A MINUTE TO TAKE A VOTE. VOTING ON AND ISSUES ONE INTO THE VOTE ON THE CALENDAR. MEDINA AYE. O'DONNELL. WHEN MORE. THEY LIKE IT. IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEPROSY. YEAH GOOD MORNING BRIAN ANDERSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SOON. AS AS FINANCES NOTED THE SEXUALLY. THE SOMEWHAT OF A COMPLICATED PROPOSAL THERE'S A LOT OF PIECES TO IT BAKING THEY SORT OF BREAK DOWN INTO TWO. AREAS ONE IS WHAT DO YOU WANT THIS PROGRAM TO LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD IN AND TO IS HOW MUCH WILL THAT COST. I'D SAY DEAL WITH THE ODD COST ISSUE FIRST OF THE KIDS THAT THE BIG TICKET ITEM HERE. O. WE DO THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL OF. TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION A UNDERSTATES THE LIKELY COST A PRESSURES IN THIS PROGRAM WE THINK. IT AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON EXACTLY HOW YOU STRUCTURE THE PROGRAM HOW MUCH IT WILL COST. BUT UNDER THE EXISTING RULES FOR THE PROGRAM WE EXPRESSED A MATE THEN. I LOVE SOMEWHERE AROUND A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FULLY FUND THE PROGRAM IN THE NEXT YEAR. NOW IN PART THAT'S DUE TO A CHANGE THAT THIS BODY MADE VERY LATE IN THE PROCESS DURING LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. WHERE WE INCREASE THE MAXIMUM AWARD ALLOCATION THAT GRANTEES COULD RECEIVE SO IT USED TO BE THAT UNDER THIS PROGRAM? CHARTER SCHOOLS COULD RECEIVE UP EITHER SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR LEASE ANOTHER FACILITY COSTS OR A MAXIMUM OF AND FIFTY DOLLARS. PER STUDENT MAXIMUM HAD BEEN SET IN LOSS SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE HAD NOT BEEN UPDATED IT IT INITIALLY PAN. AYE CAP ON REALLY EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE. PLACEMENTS BUT OVER TIME WITH INFLATION AND GONE TO THE POINT WHERE EVEN CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT HAD BELOW AVERAGE FACILITY COSTS WERE CAPPED AT THAT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY LEVEL WERE NOT RECEIVING THE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. IN SO THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED AND LAST YEAR'S MAY REVISE AND THE LEGISLATURE ENDED UP ADOPTING THIS PROPOSAL. THAT WE RETROACTIVELY ADJUSTED UPWARDS FOR THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AND K. TWELVE PROGRAMS AND APPLIED THAT COLA GOING FORWARD. THAT INCREASES SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY CAP TO A LITTLE LESS THAN TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER EIGHTY AIM. AND THAT RESULTED AND A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE COST OF THIS PROGRAM AND WE THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THIS PROGRAM WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE ADMINISTRATION. UGH PROJECTS GOING FORWARD. HOWEVER EVEN IF. THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO RESEND THAT MAXIMUM A. THE EGGMAN GRANT AWARD INCREASE THAT AND ADOPTED LAST YEAR GO BACK TO THE HISTORICAL SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. PER STUDENT CAP WE THINK THIS PROGRAM WOULD STILL REQUIRE AN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION JUST TO FULLY FUND AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. BUT NOW TO DEAL WITH THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THEY MAKE SEVERAL. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAM IN PART TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE COST PRESSURES. A AM ONE OF THEIR PROPOSALS WE THINK IS IS REASONABLE AND WE WE RECOMMEND APPROVING IT IT IT WOULD REMOVE THIS LANGUAGE THAT. PROVIDES AN AUTOMATIC BACK FILL FOR PRIOR YEAR AWARD SO. WHAT HAPPENS UNDER CURRENT A LOT RIGHT NOW WITH THIS PROGRAM IS THAT WHEN IT'S OVER SUBSCRIBED THE AD AS IS THE CASE AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN? ALL RECIPIENTS RECEIVE A PRO RATED AWARDS OF RIGHT NOW. RECIPIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEIR ELIGIBLE AWARD AMOUNT. UNDER CURRENT LAW. ANY ALLOCATION THAT WAS GIVEN TO THIS PROGRAM NEXT YEAR WOULD FIRST BE USED TO GET ALL OF THOSE RECIPIENTS UP TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SO. SAY IF THERE'S A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SHORTFALL THE FIRST TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU ALLOCATE TO THIS PROGRAM EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WILL GO TO THAT PROGRAM. THAT LANGUAGE IS UNUSUAL WE DON'T TREAT ANY OTHER K. TWELVE CATEGORICAL PROGRAM IN THIS FAT. FASHION AND IT EXISTS FOR A VERY SPECIFIC HISTORICAL REASON WHICH WAS A TRANSITION THAT THE PROGRAM WENT THROUGH SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND HAS SINCE BEEN. PLEADED WENT WE THINK IT'S OUT OF DATE AND RECOMMEND. APPROVING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO REMOVE IT. ON WE DO KNOW THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE'S CONCERNED. ABOUT. THE PROBATION IN THE CURRENT YEAR AWARD CA CAN FOLLOW THE PRACTICE THAT OCCASIONALLY FOLLOWS WITH OTHER CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS OF PROVIDING A DISCRETIONARY ONE TIME BACKFILL. AND THE OTHER THREE. CHANGES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. RECOMMENDS MAKING TO THE PROGRAM O. WE IT WE JUST DON'T THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROVIDED A COMPELLING JUSTIFICATION FOR SO AND THIS INCLUDES. A CAPPING A THE. GROWTH AND REDUCE COSTS THAT CAN BE CLAIMED FOR THE AWARD AT THE K. TWELVE COLA LEVEL. OF WHEN WE THINK THIS IS UNNECESSARY ALREADY APPLICANTS HAVE TO PAY AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR LEASE COSTS A UNDER THIS PROGRAM WE THINK THAT'S. A POWERFUL INCENTIVE IN MOST CASES TO KEEP THOSE THESE COSTS LOW. THAT BIG CONCERN HERE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT IS SPECIFIC TO CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT HAVE. A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WHERE THEIR LANDLORD ALSO SERVES ON THE CHARTER SCHOOLS BOARD MAKE SOME FACILITY DECISIONS IN THOSE CASES PERHAPS THE CHARTER SCHOOL HAS AN INCENTIVE TO OVERSTATE THEIR FACILITY COSTS MUST GET A MORE GENEROUS GRANT FROM THE STATE. OF IT WE THINK THAT THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED JUST BY GIVING THE SCHOOL FINANCE AUTHORITY SOME OF BROADER DISCRETION TO REQUIRE INDEPENDENT LEASE APPRAISALS WHEN THEY CREDIBLY SUSPECT THAT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST EXISTS. THE OTHER. THE PROPOSAL HERE WOULD BE. DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF LEASE COSTS IN OTHER FACILITY BECAUSE SOME OF THE PROGRAM AND BE. PRIORITIZING LEASE BECAUSE OVER MAINTENANCE COSTS OF OR BUILDING IMPROVEMENT COSTS IN YEARS IN WHICH THE PROGRAM IS OVERSUBSCRIBED WE WE DO THINK THAT THERE'S A LOGIC HERE THAT THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM WAS PRIMARILY TO HELP. CHARTER SCHOOLS WITH THEIR LEASE COSTS. AND YOU KNOW ALL SCHOOLS DEAL WITH COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MAINTENANCE AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS IN MOST CASES THIS IS. PROVIDED OUT THERE GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING WE THINK IDEALLY CHARTER SCHOOLS WOULD DO THE SAME. BUT IN PRACTICE WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO DISENTANGLE THAT FROM THESE COSTS BECAUSE OFTENTIMES. LEASES AND INCLUDE A LANDLORD PROVIDED MAINTENANCE OR BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS SO AND SO FOR THAT REASON WE PROJECT THAT WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THAT PROPOSALS WITH. THANK YOU CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FINANCE AUTHORITY. YEAH HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS MY NAME'S KATRINA JOE HANSHIN ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FINANCE AUTHORITY AND WITH ME TODAY IS IAN DAVIS HE'S THE. CO PROGRAM LEAD OVER THE SB SEVEN FORTY PROGRAM. THANK YOU. I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. IF YOU. WE ARE GOING TO SKIP ITEM SIX.

OUR SCHOOLS ARE IN LOS SOCIOECONOMIC AREAS AND RELY ON THIS PROGRAM AS WE HAVE HEARD TIRES EXISTENCE TO PROVIDE CRITICAL FINANCE THAT FACILITIES FUNDING AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT FUNDING THAT WE'VE RECEIVED OVER THE YEARS. OUR NEW SCHOOL LIGHTHOUSE CHARTER SCHOOL IS THE LOWEST IN IN THE LOWEST INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD IN WEST SACRAMENTO. WE APPLIED FOR STATE BOND PROGRAM FUNDS AND WE'RE NOT SELECTED.

GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION I ACTUALLY WANTED TO COMMENT ON A NUMBER OF BIDEN'S VERY BRIEFLY I WE APPRECIATE THE UMP RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE. ANALYST'S OFFICE MAKES IN REGARD TO DIFFERENTIATED PAY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION INSTRUCTORS ALTHOUGH WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE AT THE STATE LEVEL BECAUSE IT CAN ALREADY BE BARGAINED LOCALLY. WE THINK A MORE ADEQUATE WAY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE IS TO ADEQUATELY FUND EDUCATION TO LC FF IN ADDITION TO EQUALIZE SPECIAL ED PAGE. ENSURING THAT WERE PROVIDING THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO ADEQUATELY SUPPORT OUR SPECIAL ED STUDENTS FILE WE DO BELIEVE THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NEED TO PROVIDE BE PROVIDED IN BOND FUNDING AND WE. WE APPRECIATE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO INCREASE THE FLOW OF THOSE BOND FUNDS AYE WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO SEE AN INCREASE TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT PRIOR TO RELEASING FUNDS FOR CHARTER FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM. AND THE. IN ADDITION OVERALL WE DO SUPPORT A. B. THIRTY ONE THIRTY SIX AND WE THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS OUR SPECIAL LATE MEANS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH. IN NOT ONLY FULLY FUNDING LC FF BUT INCREASE THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE SUPPORTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU BOB WAGNER ON BEHALF OF NEWPORT MASON IRVINE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ORANGE COUNTY AND SARAH AND OAK GROVE AND THE THOMAS HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY.

ON THE URGENCY OBVIOUSLY ON A PERSONAL NOTE FOR THOSE KIDS WHO WILL NEVER AGAIN HAVE A CHANCE TO ACCESS THE FACILITIES ONCE. THE TIME IS GONE IN THEY'VE MOVED ON THAT'S OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT BUT PRACTICALLY. THINGS ARE NOT GETTING CHEAPER AND CONSTRUCTION OF OF THE COST OF MONEY IS GOING NOWHERE BUT UP AND THE INFLATION ON BUILDING THE SCHOOLS IS GOING CRAZY WITH SOME OF THE UP EMBARGOES OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE SEEN. FINALLY AS FAR AS THE PRACTICALITY OF OF EXPANDING OUR CAPACITY A PROCESS THESE THINGS YOU KNOW THE MONEY COMES FROM THE BONDS THEMSELVES. SO IT'S IT'S NOT A ZERO SUM GAME WE DO HAVE RESOURCES AND AS FAR AS THE HUMAN ELEMENT. BACK IN THE EARLY NINETIES WE FACED SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND OPSEC. CONTRACTED OUT WITH THE SET UP WITH THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO GET FIVE F. T. E. TO HELP THEM OUT. SO YOU KNOW IF WE BELIEVE AS WE DO THAT THIS IS A CRISIS UP I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT WE CAN RESOLVE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRIS WALKER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SHEET METAL. CONDITIONING CONTRACTORS WERE HERE TO LEND OUR SUPPORT ON ISSUE NUMBER THREE ON SCHOOL FACILITIES. GETTING THE MONEY OUT EARLY AS GOING TO BE A LOT. MORE ECONOMICAL FOR THE STATE A CALIFORNIA THESE ARE REAL JOBS. AND CONTINUING TO DELAY THE CELL OF THESE BONDS ONLY INCREASES THE COST FOR THE TAXPAYER. WE'RE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT THAT WE NEED NEW FACILITIES WE NEED RETROFIT. FACILITIES WE NEED TO FOCUS ON INDOOR AIR QUALITY. ON ALL THIS CANNOT BE DONE UNTIL WE SELL THOSE BONDS A START ADDRESSING THE HUGE BACKLOG THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING. SO WE WOULD LEND OUR SUPPORT TO GETTING THESE BONDS OUT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER THANK YOU. IS A CABINET MEMBERS. J'AI SURPRISE SUIT WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT TO AND FORTY THOUSAND CLASSIFIES TO EMPLOYEES IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF MORE FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AB DID ONE THIRTY SIX. IS A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE SACHA INCREASE IN FUNDING. AND WE CAN APPRECIATE THE FOCUS ON TEACHERS ON TO STRUGGLE TO TRY TO GET MORE BUT. PLEASE RECOGNIZE DOCTOR CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ARE ARTISTS ADULTS WHO ARE AT THE FRONTLINE AND MANY CASES AND WE WOULD ASK THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BEYOND JUST IT'S TO ALLOW THE ELIGIBLE ELIGIBILITY. A PARA PROFESSIONAL IN SPECIAL EDUCATION TO BE RECRUITED RETRAIN. AND WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF RECOGNIZING THAT CLASSIFY STAFF. ARGUE FRONTLINE FOLKS WHO WORK WITH THESE CHILDREN AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU KNOW AS WE MAKE A FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THOSE THEIR LOCAL BUDGET. THAT UP TO FIFTEEN PERCENT BE SET ASIDE FOR CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES PUT THOSE KINDS OF RETENTION. OUR AND RECRUITMENT EFFORT AND FINALLY. WE ALSO WOULD URGE YOU TO SET ASIDE WE HAD SUGGESTED A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN ONE TIME FUNDS IT'S A GOOD USE OF ONE TIME FUND FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ALL THESE AREA. IN SPECIAL EDUCATION WE HEALTH OF STAFF AND MEMBERS WHO ARE A LITTLE BE BITTEN OR SCRATCH AND THEY NEED TO LEARN TO B TRAINED ON HOW TO ADDRESS. CRITICALLY WITH KIDS WHO WERE.

MISSED ASSEMBLYMAN RODRIGUEZ HAS A BILL SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN DATA DRESSED DOES ISSUE IT'S A GOOD USE OF ONE TIME FUNDS AND WE THINK YOU CAN SET IT ASIDE FOR MULTI YEAR TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. WE ALL SHOULD TO DO THOSE THINGS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU. THEY ARE ABACHA'S OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS IN SUPPORT OF THE ALEJO'S RECOMMENDATION TO ESTABLISH A FACILITIES BOND EXPENDITURE PLAN AND DECREASE THE BOND AUTHORITY FOR THAT THE STATE.

SPECIAL YOUR SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS HAVE ALL THE SUPPORT POSSIBLE THINK YOU. GOOD MORNING REBEKAH CURLY ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING AND THE COUNTY SCHOOL FACILITIES CONSTRUED CONSORTIUM. HERE TO SPEAK TO ON THE SCHOOL FACILITIES ITEM WE BELIEVE THAT SIX HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO SELL IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS NOT IMPLEMENTING THE WILL OF THE VOTERS. TO DATE ONLY ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT OF THE FUNDS THAT WERE AUTHORIZED BY PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN PROVIDED TO PROJECTS WE CURRENTLY HAVE A BACKLOG OF THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN PROJECTS. THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT HAVE HAD THEIR PLANS APPROVED BY THE DIVISION OF THE STATE ARCHITECT THEY HAVE ALSO HAD THEIR PLANTS REVIEWED. AND APPROVED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR THEIR EDUCATIONAL ADEQUACY ANOTHER WAITING FOR THE FINAL APPROVAL AT THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AND THE FUNDING. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH A GROUP A LARGE COALITION AND WE ARE ASKING TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE PONDS ON OUT. IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND TO ALSO FUND THREE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PROJECTS IN THE FISCAL YEAR. AS FAR AS THE COSTS GO WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE ABOUT A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE ON DEBT SERVICE BUT AS A PRIOR SPEAKER MENTIONED MOST OF THE COSTS ARE BOND FUNDS. SO WE THINK THAT THE PRICE IS RELATIVELY SMALL COMPARED TO THE PRICE OF DELAY AND THE DECREASED PURCHASING POWER THAT YOU ADOPT. LASTLY WE AGREE WITH ALEJO AND THEIR ANALYSIS THE YOU CAN PROCESS MORE OF THESE APPLICATIONS WITH THE EXISTING STOPPED OPSEC. AND UP ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS I REPRESENT THEM AS WELL THINK THANK YOU. ANA FERREIRA WITH THE SCHOOL ENERGY COALITION ALIGNING OURSELVES WITH THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING IN COSMOS COMMENTS TODAY. ENERGY EFFICIENCY SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO BE THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT AND HISTORY WE NEED THIS MONEY TO GO OUT. IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE COST INCREASES DUE TO SOME OF OF THE LABOR AND ENERGY ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW SCHOOLS WANT TO BE MORE RESILIENT. IN A LIGHT OF RECENT NATURAL DISASTERS THEY'RE BECOMING MORE OF FREQUENT AND. GOOD SCHOOL FACILITIES WILL HELP US. MAKE THEM SO SO WE APPRECIATE THAT WE WANT TO SEE. THAT THREE BILLION DOLLARS GO UP THIS YEAR. GOOD MORNING DARYN WATERS DIPPY SUPERINTENDENT ROBERT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. MEDINA WILL ALL ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED STAFF TO DATE WERE UNABLE TO DO. YES BY NOT SELLING MORE PROFIT YOU IN BONDS IT IS SLOWING DOWN. THE FLOW OF FUNDS TO COMMITTEE COLLEGES AS WELL AS KATE TWELVE. THERE IS IT THAT SHE WAS TALK ABOUT AUTHORIZATION WAS AUTHORIZATION IS TO. DO THE PROJECTS APPROVE THOSE PROJECTS BUT THERE'S NO CASH. TO BUILD IT INTO INTO FUNDED THAT COMES FROM THE BOND SALE. SO YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT IN THAT MANNER ARE PROJECTS WILL BE SLOWED DOWN AND PUSHED BACK YEARS. IT GOES BACK TO WHAT MISS. MISS. KUN SAID ABOUT HOW HOW LONG YOU WANT THE PROGRAM TO BE TWO ONE FIVE YEAR PROGRAM AT TWELVE YOUR PROGRAMMER TWENTY FIVE YEAR PROGRAM. FOR THIS THIS DIED THE NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOR PROP FIFTY ONE. ADDITIONALLY ESCALATION IS EATING INTO INTO THOSE COSTS IS EXPLAINED BY ANOTHER. SPEAKER BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS EIGHT TO TEN PERCENT ANNUALLY COST INCREASE SO FOR HER HER MILLION DOLLAR HEISTS HER MILLION DOLLAR HIGH SCHOOL. AS CAUSING AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR THAT WE WAIT FOR THIS MONEY TO COME AND THAT IS A STAFFING ISSUE OPSEC I CAN ASSURE YOU. I GOTTA BELIEVE THEY'RE NOT MAKING THAT MUCH MONEY WE'D SAVE TREMENDOUS ON MONEY BY HIRING STAFFING THEM UP. SO WE'RE NOT PAYING THE COST IN A CONSTRUCTION. ANOTHER ITEM SIX EQUALIZATION WERE IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY ONE THIRTY SIX. EQUALIZATION IS THE THE THE LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD FOR OUR SPECIAL ED. OF FUNDING AB SIX OR TWO DOLLARS ANYTHING THAT GOES IN AB SIX OF TO. A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR WILL HELP DISTRICTS OF REDUCE DURING CROTCH MEANT. THAT IT ALL DISTRICTS ARE FACING WITH ADDITIONAL COSTS CONTINUE TO ESCALATE THANKS FOR TIME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE'S JEFF BACA REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS IN THE TWENTY THREE SCHOOL DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. ON SCHOOL FACILITIES I WOULD SIMPLY ALIGN MYSELF WITH THEIR PREVIOUS COMMENTS ABOUT THE NEED TO ACCELERATE THE RATE OF EXPENDITURE AND GETTING THE BOND DOLLARS OUT. AND THEN ON SPECIAL EDUCATION. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE IS PROBABLY THE LAST MAYBE NOT THE LAST BUT THE BIGGEST. A IN GAP OF INEQUITY IN TERMS OF FUNDING AYE IN EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT GAP IS GROWING. SO WE WOULD SUPPORT ANY ALLOCATION ANY ACTION THAT THE ASSEMBLY WOULD TAKE. UP WITH RESPECT TO SPECIAL LOOK AT EDUCATION EQUALIZATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEDINA SOME OF MATTER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU FOR REMAINING. ON I'M HERE TODAY MICHAEL HOLE SIZE ON BEHALF OF THE FORTY SEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN KERN COUNTY WE SERVE ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND I LIKE TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO ITEM NUMBER SIX. I'D LIKE TO PLACE ITEM NUMBER SIX IN THE ISSUE OF EQUITY THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFIES IN THE CONTEXT OF ACTION THAT YOU'VE ALREADY SUPPORTED WHICH IS FULL FUNDING OF LCF AFFAN ALL LCF OF TARGETS. AS MR MARKET JUST MENTIONED. SPECIAL ED INEQUITY. IS THE GREATEST SINGLE INEQUITY THAT EXISTS IN OUR FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA. POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF HOMESCHOOL TRANSPORTATION FOR SOME DISTRICTS. OUR OUR DISTRICTS ARE VERY GRATIFIED BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S FULLY FUNDING TWO YEARS EARLY OF LCF TARGETS. THAT SUPPLEMENTAL INS AND CONCENTRATION MONEY BRINGS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS INTO KERN COUNTY. WE HAVE TREMENDOUS NEEDS ARE OF DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND KERN. THE PROBLEM OF SPECIAL ED INEQUITY. COMES TO ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN KERN COUNTY THAT'S ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION GRANT. IN CURRENT. SO THE FACT THAT THIS INEQUITY EXISTS AND CONTINUES TO EXIST IT DIMINISHES THAT UNDERMINES THE ABILITY OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND KERN. REALLY TOOK TO TO MEET THAT THAT THE GOALS AND THE PROMISE OF LC FF SO AS MISTER BLOCKAGES SAID WE WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT ANYTHING THIS COMMITTEE COULD DO. ALONG THE LINES OF SUPPORTING MR O'DONNELL SPILL IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SPECIAL ED EQUITY IN EQUALIZATION THANK YOU. MR MEMBERS MY DILLON REPRESENT THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION ECHOING THE SENTIMENTS OF OTHERS WE WOULD ALSO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR EQUALIZING SPECIAL EDUCATION AS WELL AS THE SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY SIX. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING RICHARD LIONEL BEHALF OF THE ESTATE RESIDENTIAL BUILDERS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPERS THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION ON ITEM THREE. WERE HERE JUST. ENCOURAGES. INCREASE THE SALE OF PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE BONDS OVER AND ABOVE WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS IN THE BUDGET. IN ADDITION TO THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE HERE TODAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MEETING THE BACKLOG. FOR ABOUT MODERNIZATION IN NEW CONSTRUCTION THE FAILURE TO. ADEQUATELY PROVIDE FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO MEET ITS HOUSING GOALS AS WELL. AND SO LET ME TELL YOU WHY IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE GROWTH AND WHERE HOUSING IS BEING BUILT. IT IS VERY COMMON FOR MASTER MITIGATION AGREEMENTS TO BE IN PLACE BETWEEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND DEVELOPERS AND THOSE MASTER MITIGATION AGREEMENTS REQUIRE. THE FUNDING TO BE IN PLACE OFTEN AND THE SCHOOLS TO BE BUILT BEFORE THOSE PROJECTS CAN MOVE FORWARD OR BEFORE THE NEXT PHASE OF THE PROJECT CAN BE BUILT. SO BY SLOW WALKING THE. SAILOR PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE BARNES WE'RE NOT ONLY. IMPACTING THE NEEDS THAT ARE OUT THERE BUT WE ARE HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ABILITY OF THE STATE COMMUTERS HOUSING NEEDS.
