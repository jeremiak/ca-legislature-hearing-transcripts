AFTER CONSIDERING THE BILL'S PROTECTION OF AN ESTIMATED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND INTERNATIONAL RECRUITER WORKERS ACROSS BASIC CATEGORIES AND INDUSTRY SECTORS. GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED THE BILL INTO LAW. DURING THE LAWS DURING THE LAWS IMPLEMENTATION THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. MISINTERPRETED THE LAW AS CODIFIED AS APPLYING ONLY TO AGE TO BE WORKERS. A TINY FRACTION OF THOSE WORKERS AS BEFORE SEVENTY SEVEN WAS INTENDED TO PROTECT FROM EXPLOITATION AND TRAFFICKING. AB NINETEEN THIRTY WAS A TECHNICAL FIX THAT WOULD EFFECTUATE SB FORTY SET FOR SEVEN SEVENS. ORIGINAL INTENT BY STRIKING LANGUAGE OF THE BILL WAS A ROLLED THE LANGUAGE THAT RESULTED YA SEIZE INTERPRETATION LIMITING LEGISLATION SCOPE. CENTER STEINBERG MAYOR STEINBERG GONNA STOP OF NOT ONLY CONFIRMED THIS THAT TESTIFIED AT COMMITTEE HEARINGS. THAT THE ORIGINAL INTENTION OF THE BILL A WILL BE AFFECTION WAITED BY THIS BILL AND THAT WHEN S. BEFORE SEVENTY SEVEN WAS NEGOTIATED EVERYONE.

THESE TROUBLES SYSTEMS OFTEN LACK THE RESOURCES TO FUND THE ONGOING COSTS FOR MAINTENANCE AND OTHER OPERATIONAL EXPENSES SUCH SUCH CHALLENGES CAN BE OVERCOME BY CONSOLIDATING NEIGHBORING SYSTEMS. ONE BAY AREA TO CONSOLIDATING IS THE COST OF HOLDING A FULL BLOWN ELECTION TO APPROVE THE SALE OF A SMALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM.

OUTSOURCE CONTRACTORS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT PAY BENEFITS HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. UNIVERSITY HEALTH ONE REQUIRED TO POST THIS INFORMATION ON A PUBLIC ACCESSIBLE WEBSITE. THIS WOULD PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW THESE CONTRACTS AFFECT WORKERS THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT TEMPORARY WORKERS THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE IMMIGRANT ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. THERE ARE LOWER WAGES THAN WITH FEW OR NO BENEFITS THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND THE MORE LIKELY RELY ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. THE QUESTION ONCE AGAIN BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE'S WHETHER THE UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA'S CONTRACTING PRACTICES ARE CONDEMNING LOW WAGE CONTRACTORS TO POVERTY AND A RELIANCE ON TAXPAYER FUNDED SOCIAL SERVICES. THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO KNOW WHAT KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IT DOES NOT KEEP TRACK OF THE OF THE INFORMATION.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR NINETY THREE BY FAMILY MEMBER BLOOM NATURALLY TO RECYCLING RICHARD BLOOM EMAIL BEEN THANK YOU FOR THE ACCOMMODATION MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THAT CALIFORNIA BEVERAGE CONTAINER PROGRAM BETTER KNOWN AS THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM. IS A SELF FUNDED PROGRAM THAT ENCOURAGES CONSUMERS TO RECYCLE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS TO PREVENT LETTERING. OVER THE THREE DECADES OF OPERATION THAT TO HAVE THUS FAR TRANSPIRED THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM. HAS DIVERTED TONS OF BEVERAGE CONTAINERS FROM LANDFILLS. AND FOR MOST OF THE TIME IT'S BEEN SEEN AS A MODEL RECYCLING PROGRAM. HOWEVER SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF THE TOTAL IN STATE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE HAS SHUTTERED THEIR OPERATIONS. THE VERY PLACES THESE OF THE VERY PLACES WERE CONSUMERS RETURN THEIR CONTAINERS TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK INTO THE PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY. ARE NOT OPERATING AS EFFICIENTLY AS IT SHOULD AND LESS MATERIALS GETTING RECYCLED THAT HAS BEEN RECYCLED IN THE PASS. SO AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY THREE WHILE NOT A SILVER BULLET MAKES SMALL BUT IMPORTANT STEPS TO MODERNIZE AND IMPROVE OUR BOTTLE DEL PROGRAM. BY AUTHORIZING CAO RECYCLE TO IMPROVE RECYCLING CONVENIENCE FOR CONSUMERS AND REMOVING OPERATIONAL RESTRICTIONS TO ENABLE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION WITHIN THE BOTTOM BELL PROGRAM.

MISTER SPEAKER THANK YOU AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE IS FOCUSED ON GETTING A MORE DATA DRIVEN AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION. OF THE HOUSING NEED WITHIN REGIONS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY JURISDICTION IS DOING ITS FAIR SHARE TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS. REFORMING THE RINA ALLOCATION PROCESS IS CRUCIAL IN SUPPORTING ALL OF OUR WORK FROM LAST YEAR ON THE HOUSING PACKAGE. TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE APPROVING HOUSING PROJECTS. THE RENO PROCESS IS CRITICAL THE SETTING THE STAGE FOR HOUSING PRODUCTION AND THE EXISTING PROCESS TOO OFTEN IGNORES THE DATA. AND ALLOW SOME CITIES TO PUSH BACK TO NUMBERS THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH RATHER THAN WHAT THE DATA SHOWS IS NEEDED. AND WHAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY ACCOMMODATE WITH CHANGES IN ZONING. FLAWED PROCESS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE MEANS THAT WE OFTEN DON'T GET HOUSING IN THE PLACES WHERE IT'S NEEDED MOST AND PLACES TOO HEAVY A BURDEN. ON CITIES THAT HAVE TO ABSORB HIGHER NUMBERS AS A RESULT. WHEN JOB RICH JURISDICTIONS DON'T HAVE A PLAN FOR HOUSING IT ALSO COMPROMISES OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE ADDS MORE OVERSIGHT TO THE RING ALLOCATION PROCESS PROVIDES FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND LIMITS THE ROLE OF REGIONAL POLITICS. WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS AND ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OUR COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL'S NOT ADDING COSTS. AND IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER MANDATES THAT THE COGS HAVE PURSUANT TO SP THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND OTHER LAWS. THEREFORE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. MISTER FRAZIER THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER.

DISABILITY POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA IN THE REMAIN NUMBERS. THE CENSUS IS GROWING DRAMATICALLY EVERY TEN YEARS BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE HOUSING. WHENEVER I TALK TO AN ADULT WHO HAS A CHILD WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. THEY'RE ALWAYS ASKING WHAT IS GONNA HAPPEN TO MY CHILD. WHEN I IE. WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO MY CHILD. IF I CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEM. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY WE CAN OFFER APPS WE PUT IN RENO AND HOUSING ELEMENTS TO ADDRESS THIS POPULATION WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT GOING FOR AND I HOPE YOU OFFER WILL LOOK AT THAT. AS A POSSIBLE AMENDMENT GOING FORWARD. FAMOUS FRAZIER SAY NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION MISTER BLOOM YOU MAY CLOSE WE WISH THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I SHARE UC. ARC. COLLEAGUES CONCERNED ABOUT.

THE OPIOID ADDICTION PREVENTION RE OF THE REHABILITATION ACT THIS BILL WOULD PLACE A VOLUNTARY ONE CENT PER MILLIGRAM. SURCHARGE ON ACTIVE OPIOIDS FOR MANUFACTURERS THAT CONTRACT WITH THE STATE THROUGH THE PREFERRED DRUG LIST ESSENTIALLY OUR FORMULARY FOR MEDI CAL. WE KNOW THAT THREE AND FOUR NEW HEROIN USERS BEGIN THEIR ADDICTION BY ABUSING. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS PAINKILLERS THIS INCREASES HEALTHCARE COSTS PLACING ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL BURDENS ON TAXPAYERS OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEM AND OVERALL REDUCING ACCESS TO OUR EMERGENCY CARE. WE'RE TOO FAMILIAR WITH THIS DEVASTATING EPIDEMIC THERE OVER TWENTY BILLS THIS SESSION DEALING WITH THIS THIS IS A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED AND. I WERE HERE WITH US TODAY ON APPROACH TO WOULD PROVIDE COUNTIES WITH RESOURCES NECESSARY TO OFFER INPATIENT OUTPATIENT REHAB PROGRAMS. BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTY. AT THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A GREAT NEED FOR MORE SERVICES PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. AND WE THINK THE INDUSTRY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY AND OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH US AS WELL. OTHER IS A ON AN OPPOSITION LETTER WAS SENT CONCERNS AND SOME PROPOSED SUGGESTIONS AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE. WITH THE WITH THE. ASSOCIATION TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AS THE BILL MOVES FOR. ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR MCCARTY. MISTER GALLAGHER YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS OF THE JOINT AUTHOR I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT. OF THIS LEGISLATION. ODDS PROBABLY NOT OFTEN THAT YOU SEE. THE GENTLEMAN FROM SACRAMENTO MYSELF JOINING UP ON BILLS. ARMED ONE OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE ONE THE MOST LIBERAL. HOWEVER WE ARE IN AGREEMENT ON THIS. THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. IS A PRESSING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THEY CANNOT BE IGNORED. AND IT IS NOT JUST GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO SOLVE. DRUG US ESPECIALLY THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH PRESCRIPTION OPIOID DRUGS ARE RISING FASTER THAN EVER AND ARE NOW THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG AMERICANS UNDER THE AGE OF FIFTY. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ALONE SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED FROM DRUG OVERDOSES THIS IS THE LARGEST ANNUAL JUMP EVER RECORDED. THIS EPIDEMIC IS HITTING THE RULE AREAS. THE HARDEST DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS ARE MOST COMMON IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. SOME RURAL COUNTIES HAVE MORE OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS THEN PEOPLE. AND LET ME JUST PUT A LITTLE PICTURE ON THIS FOR YOU IN BUTTE COUNTY RIGHT THAT I REPRESENT. THEIR OVER ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED PRESCRIPTIONS PER ONE THOUSAND RESIDENTS. THE CDC AND OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS MEASURE OPIOIDS IN A UNIT KNOWN AS M. EMMYS. MORPHINE MILLIGRAM EQUIVALENCE. BUTTE COUNTY IS AVERAGE IS. ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY M. M. EMMYS PRESCRIBE PER RESIDENT ANNUALLY THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IS SIX HUNDRED FORTY. TO PUT THESE IN PERSPECTIVE A TWO HUNDRED MILLIGRAM DOSE WOULD BE LETHAL. AB TWENTY FORTY SIX REQUIRES THAT COMPANIES THAT WANT TO PUT THEIR OPIOID PRODUCTS ON THE MEDI CAL FORMULA VERY. PAYING REBATE THAT GOES TOWARDS ADDICTION TREATMENT. THERE ARE MANY REASONS ADDICTION. THE OPIOID ADDICTION HAS BECOME. SUCH A HUGE PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE ADDICTIVE PROPERTIES OF THESE DRUGS. BUT RIGHT NOW. THE PROBLEM IS LARGELY SHOULDERED BY THE TAXPAYER ALONE. AND MANUFACTURES NEED TO BE PART. OF THE SOLUTION. THE MAJORITY OF THE PERSONS WITH OPIOID ADDICTIONS. AND EVEN THOSE WHO ARE NOW ADDICTED TO HEROIN STARTED WITH PRESCRIPTION PAIN KILLERS. AB TWENTY FORTY SIX ONE SURE THAT WE CAN EXPAND TREATMENT IN AREAS THAT NEED IT THE MOST. AND AS PART OF A MULTI PRONGED BIPARTISAN APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE OPIOID CRISIS. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. AS WE KNOW THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC IS GROWING AND WE DESPERATELY NEED ASSISTANCE FOR BOTH PREVENTION AND TREATMENT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN WOEFULLY BEHIND. IN DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE AND THE PROBLEM JUST KEEPS GROWING OF THE MONEY COLLECTED THROUGH THIS MEASURE WILL BE ADMINISTERED AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND WILL BE DISTRIBUTED BASED ON NEED AND POPULATION. THE LACK OF AVAILABLE FARMS TREATMENT CENTERS AND OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM OPIOID USE DISORDER. IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEATH TOLL AND THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF FUNDING FOR REHABILITATION. AND EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGNS WHICH ARE SO IMPORTANT TO INFORM THE PUBLIC ON THE RISKS OF OPIOID ABUSE AYE URGENT AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON. AND MISTER DALLI.

SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE FROM LARGE URBAN DISTRICTS LIKE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED OAKLAND UNIFIED SACRAMENTO AND SAN DIEGO UNIFIED. TO SUBURBAN DISTRICTS TO RULE DISTRICTS. THEY'RE ALL SAYING THE SAME THING WHICH IS. BETTER DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT SCHOOL FUNDING RESTORATION THAT WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IN RECENT YEARS. THOSE FUNDING INCREASES ARE NOT KEEPING PACE WITH THE INCREASE INCREASES AND FIX COSTS THE STUDENT DISTRICTS ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FACING AN UPCOMING YEARS. AB TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT IS PROPOSING. ASPIRATIONAL FUNDING TARGETS TO NEED TO. BATES GRANT SELF FUNDING TARGETS THAT WILL HELP ALL DISTRICTS.

LEADERSHIP GROUPS INCLUDING THE TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS THE SCHOOL BOARD ASSOCIATION. ALSO COSPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION TEACHERS I ASK FOR A AYE VOTE. MS BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE. IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION AS A CO AUTHOR. A BECAUSE WE WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE BEEN LOOKING BACKWARDS. AND WHILE I'VE BEEN PLEASED TO SUPPORT ALMOST NINE BILLION DOLLARS MORE IN EDUCATION FUNDING IN MY SHORT TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE IT'S TIME FOR US TO LOOK FORWARDS. WITH NOT JUST ASPIRATIONAL BUT A SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR OUR SCHOOLS. IT PARTICULARLY THE WAY THAT THIS BILL TWENTY EIGHT AWAY DOES WHICH IS IT HELPS ALL SHIPS RISE BECAUSE IT PUTS THE DOLLARS INTO THE BASE GRANT INSTEAD OF. A MORE SPECIFIC FUNDING FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS AND I GIVEN EXAMPLE OF WHY THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. ONE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. ARE ARE LOOKING AT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FUNDING LEVELS. IT'S ELEVEN YEARS LATER THAT WE'VE WE'VE PUT THAT FUNDING IN. BUT ONE IN PARTICULAR LIVERMORE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. IT DOESN'T REACH THE THRESHOLD FOR ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE STUDENTS WHO WOULD THEN GET THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING UNDER THE EXISTING LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA BUT THERE ARE SCHOOL SITES IN THAT ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THAT HAVE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE STUDENT POPULATION. IT'S ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REACH THE FIFTY FIVE PERCENT LEVEL IN THE FUNDING FORMULA THOSE KIDS AND THE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS THAT HELP THOSE KIDS DON'T GET A SINGLE PENNY MORE. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO MAKE A COMMITMENT IN THE YEARS GOING FORWARD TO MORE FUNDING FOR ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS IN THE BASS GRANT AND MAKE IT A SIGNIFICANT FINDING SUPPORT. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTMENTS THAT WE COULD BE MAKING RIGHT NOW EDUCATION IS WHERE WE SHOULD BE MAKING IT. NOW I WILL ADD OUR WORK IS NOT DONE. CINDY MORE MONEY AT OUR SCHOOLS WITHOUT REFORMING HOW WE OPERATE THEM WITHOUT BRINGING GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. ENSURING THAT WE HAVE EFFECTIVE QUALITY TEACHERS IN EVERY SINGLE CLASSROOM ACROSS OF THIS STATE AND THAT WE HAVE GREAT PRINCIPLES FOR MANAGERS OF EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL. THAT MEANS OUR WORK IS INCOMPLETE. BUT IT STARTS BY BACKING THOSE SCHOOLS UP WITH THE FUNDING THEY DESERVE WHAT OUR KIDS DESERVE AND PUTTING IT INTO THE BASE GRANT. AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I LOOK FORWARD IN THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS HOPEFULLY TO BE ABLE TO COUPLE THIS FUNDING WITH THE TYPES OF REFORMS OUR KIDS ALSO DESERVE. AND I AM PLEASED TO WORK WITH OUR COLLEAGUE FROM. TORRANCE ON THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THING IS BAKER MISTER KILEY. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER YOU KNOW ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MANY MANY OUTSTANDING SCHOOLS I INCLUDING TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS CHARTER PUBLIC SCHOOLS SCHOOLS OF ALL KINDS. THEY GET TREMENDOUS RESULTS OFTEN WITHOUT THE OPTIMAL LEVEL OF RESOURCES. BUT LOOKING BEYOND THESE EXAMPLES OF SUCCESS OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM REMAINS IN CRISIS. ESPECIALLY FOR OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE LIVING IN POVERTY. TO ACHIEVE AT LEVELS AS ALLOW HERE AS ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY WITH UNCONSCIONABLE. ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. WHAT THIS CRISIS DEMANDS OF US IS THE SENSE OF URGENCY? BUT TODAY'S BILL REPRESENTS NOTHING. THE KIND. INSTEAD IT BUT FOR ITS PUTS FORWARD A PROPOSAL THAT IS AS INEFFECTUAL AS IT IS ON IMAGINATIVE MORE FUNDING. FOR A BROKEN SYSTEM. SINCE GOVERNOR BROWN TOOK OFFICE ANNUAL SPENDING ON EDUCATION HAS INCREASED BY THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. PER PUPIL SPENDING WAS THIS BILL CAUSED INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY HAS GROWN FROM JUST OVER TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. TO PROPOSE SIXTEEN SIXTEEN THOUSAND EIGHTY FIVE. IN THE CURRENT BUDGET. AND YET STILL SEVENTY THREE PERCENT OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS SEVENTY TWO PERCENT OF LATINO STUDENTS SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AND EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF ENGLISH LEARNERS. ARE NOT MEETING STANDARDS IN FOURTH GRADE MATH. COMPARED TO OTHER STATES FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS WE ARE FORTY FOUR FOR EIGHTH GRADE READING. FORTY SIX FOR FOURTH GRADE READING. AND FIFTY S.. FOR FOURTH GRADE MATH SO THE QUESTION WE HAVE TO ASK IS. IF THE LAST THIRTY BILLION DIDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WHY WILL THE NEXT THIRTY BILLION? WHAT'S MOST TRAGIC IS THAT ALL OF THIS WAS ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE IN FACT IT WAS PREDICTED. IN A TWO THOUSAND SEVEN REPORT COMMISSIONED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ITSELF. THAT REPORT TITLED GETTING DOWN TO FACTS CONCLUDED. MORE MONEY IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS UNLIKELY TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT TO MEET EXPECTATIONS. IN LAS ACCOMPANIED BY SIGNIFICANT. STOMACH REFORMS. NOTABLY THE REPORT ALSO STATED THAT PRINCIPLE SITE GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN DISMISSING INEFFECTIVE TEACHERS AT THE MOST ESSENTIAL CHANGE NEEDED TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES OF COURSE LAST YEAR WE HAD A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE DONE JUST THAT. AND MEAN TO REFORM CALIFORNIA'S TENURE POLICY WHICH IS A NATIONAL OUT LIAR AND IS OPPOSED BY EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS. THAT BELL AB TWELVE TWENTY BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO WAS GUIDED BY THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND ULTIMATELY STALLED IN THE SENATE AND OF COURSE THAT IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE. OF THIS LEGISLATURE'S HOSTILITY TO THE TYPE OF STUDENT CENTERED REFORM THAT WOULD MAKE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. MILLIMETERS O'DONNELL COULD COULD THE GEL MODEL STATE YOUR POINT OF ORDER. THE GENTLEMAN FROM GRANITE MAY SPEAK TO THE BILL HE'S NOT SPEAKING TO THE BILL. THAT'S A POINT OF ORDER THAT IS WELL TAKEN. THEIR REFERENCES TO PREVIOUS LEGISLATION IN THIS BODY MISTER KILEY PLEASE REFER TO THE BILL IN FRONT OF THE BODY AT THIS POINT. YOU MAY DO YOU THINK OUR EDUCATION CHAIRMAN FOR MAKING THE POINT MORE BEAUTIFULLY THAN I EVER COULD. THAT THERE IS ALL THE APPETITE IN THE WORLD FOR MORE FUNDING BUT IT IS CONSIDERED IRRELEVANT TO EVEN ASK WHETHER THE SYSTEM IS WORKING IN A WAY THAT FUNDING WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR OUR STUDENTS. NOW TO FINISH MY STATEMENT. AND THANK YOU FOR RIGHTFULLY DENYING THAT POINT OF ORDER. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE PART OF HIS LEGISLATURE EILEEN MUSTELIDAE TO CLARIFY MR KILEY. THE POINT OF ORDER WAS WELL TAKEN. AND I ISSUED MY RULING YOU MAY PROCEED ON THE ITEM YOU HAVE A MINUTE THIRTY EIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. AS I WAS SAYING THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF OUR LEGISLATURE'S HOSTILITY TO THE TYPE OF STUDENT CENTER REFORM THAT WOULD MAKE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. MEANINGFUL. INCLUDING BY THE WAY I ARE STATES ONGOING FAILURE TO MEET MINIMUM ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. TODAY'S BILL ALSO RAISES THE QUESTION AS TO WHERE ALL OF THIS MONEY HAS BEEN GOING. AND THERE ARE TWO ANSWERS TO THAT. THE FIRST IS THAT INCREASINGLY IT'S GOING NOT TO THE CLASSROOM BUT TO IMPLEMENT RETIREMENT COSTS THERE ARE A LOT OF DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT OF AB SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I DON'T BLAME THEM BECAUSE THIS IS OVERWHELMING. THEIR BUDGETS SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED FOR EXAMPLE IS DIVERTING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO RETIREMENT COST THIS YEAR THAT'S TWO THOUSAND PER STUDENT THIS YEAR TWICE AS MUCH AS JUST FIVE YEARS AGO SOCIAL WE SHOULD BE CLEAR. THAT WITHOUT MEANINGFUL PENSION AND HEALTH CARE REFORM WE TALK ABOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT FUNDING THAT'S GOING TO ACTED TEACHERS ARE TO SCHOOLS. BUT THE SECOND ANSWERED THAT QUESTION AS TO WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING AS WE REALLY DON'T KNOW. THIRTY SECOND THE GOVERNOR ABOUT PROPOSED BUDGET REPORTS TO ADD ANOTHER ELEMENT OF TRANSPARENCY AS TO HOW FUNDING IS BEING DELIVERED TO DISTRICTS WE STILL HAVE A LITTLE INFORMATION ON WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS. HOW MUCH OF THIS MONEY IS ACTUALLY REACHING SCHOOLS TO EIGHT ARE HARD WORKING PRINCIPLES TEACHERS SUPPORT STAFF IN HELPING STUDENTS LEARN? IN CLOSING MISTER SPEAKER WHAT TODAY'S BILL REALLY IS IT'S AN EXCUSE SO WE CAN TELL OURSELVES THAT THERE ARE JUST MORE MONEY. EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN RAMON AS WELL AS MY COME THE COMMENTS FROM. A COLLEAGUE FROM THE ROSEVILLE. CLEARLY. EDUCATION REFORM IS A COMPLEX SUBJECT.

AS I'M ABLE TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU AND OTHERS IN ATLANTA TRANSPORTATION. RESEARCH YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE IS A BAY AREA BILL THAT REQUIRES BAY AREA RAPID TRANSIT OR PART. TO SALVAGE TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT ZONING STANDARDS THAT WOULD SUPPORT SMART GROWTH. ONLY ON PART ONLY IN YOUR STATION. THE BAY AREA LIKE MANY OTHER PARTS OF OUR STATE ARE SUFFERING FROM THE TWIN CRISES OF HOUSING AND TRAFFIC CONGESTION. BECAUSE OF A LACK OF HOUSING WITH COUNTLESS RESIDENTS SPENDING HOURS DRIVING BETWEEN WHERE THEY WORK AND WHERE THEY LIVE AN AVERAGE OF SEVENTY NINE HOURS SITTING IN GRIDLOCK ON TOP OF LONG COMMUTES. UNFORTUNATELY TODAY MANY BART STATION SO SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF ACRES OF ASPHALT SURFACE PARKING LOTS FILLED BY CARS. FILLED WITH CARS BY DAY AND VACANT LOTS BY NIGHT. THIS BILL IS NEEDED BECAUSE PART HAS BEEN AROUND FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS BUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF DEVELOP ALL PARCELS ARE STILL PARKING LOTS. TOO MANY CITIES HAVE BUILT NO HOUSING NEXT TO STATIONS AND THE ONES THAT DID WATER DOWN PROJECTS. THAT TOOK TEN TO THIRTY YEARS FOR APPROVAL. THIS IS A NARROWLY TAILORED TRANSIT OR IN DEVELOPMENT BILL. IT ONLY APPLIES TO PARK ON LAND THE THREE HUNDRED OR SO ACRES THAT ARE NOW NINETY FIVE PERCENT PARKING LOTS IN THEIR DEVELOP A AREAS. BART TODAY IRONICALLY COULD BUILD TRANSIT MAINTENANCE OR PARKING FACILITIES WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL PROOF WALLS BUT CAN'T PERMIT HOUSING OR MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT. IT ONLY APPLIES TO SOME BART STATIONS IN AREAS DIRECTLY REPRESENTED OF ON THE ELECTED PARK BOARD TO CREATE DIRECT AND LOCAL POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS BILL REQUIRES THE BART BOARD TO ESTABLISH BROAD TOT ZONING STANDARDS. WITH TWENTY PERCENT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND THE CITY WOULD HAVE TWO YEARS TO UPDATE MORE SPECIFIC ZONING. BART WOULD BE ALSO REQUIRED TO INCORPORATE LOCAL DESIGN GUIDELINES IN DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WITH PART TOT DEVELOPERS AND CITIES THAT MEET MARKET RATE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARENA. WOULD BE EXEMPTED. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW TWENTY THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS TO BILL TO BE BUILT NEAR BART STATIONS IT WOULD INCREASE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP SUSTAINABILITY WALK ABILITY. AND REDUCE CAR USE CONGESTION AND GREENHOUSE GASES WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER GRAYSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO RISE AS A JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. AS THE FORMER MAYOR OF CONCORD I TAKE LAND USE AND ZONING AUTHORITY VERY VERY SERIOUSLY AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE GRANTS BART. A NARROWLY TAILORED AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH BASIC DENSITY AND PARKING STANDARDS ON BART OWN LAND. THE EXISTING APPROACH TO HOUSING AND TRANSIT DEVELOPMENT IS NOT WORKING. THE PROBLEM IS NOT THAT DEVELOPMENT AROUND BART CONFLICTS WITH LOCAL POLICY GENERALLY THESE COMMUNITIES ARE STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF WALKABLE MIXED USE COMMUNITIES ADJACENT TO BART. BUT LOCAL FACTIONS AROUND BART STATIONS ARE ABLE TO CREATE EXTRAORDINARY DELAYS AS AN EXAMPLE. THE PLEASANT HILL BART TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT PROJECT TOOK OVER ELEVEN YEARS TO DELIVER EARLY PHASES KEY SITES REMAIN UNDEVELOPED EVEN AFTER TWENTY YEARS. IT TAKES TOO LONG TO DELIVER HOUSING AND JOBS AT THE HIGHEST PRIORITY LOCATIONS IN THE BAY AREA INCREDIBLY THE LARGEST CITY AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY PRODUCED. A NET INCREASE OF ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND NINE LIVING UNITS AND THE LAST FIVE YEARS. IT'S NO WONDER WE ARE EXPERIENCING A HOUSING CRISIS WE HAVE WORKED EXTENSIVELY AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CITY'S COVERED BY THIS BILL TO ADDRESS THEIR LEGITIMATE CONCERNS. ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL AND MAINTAINING COMMUNITY CHARACTER AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE. ISN'T IT INNOVATIVE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO DELIVERING PROJECTS THAT REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS MANAGE CONGESTION AND MEET INFILL HOUSING NEEDS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS MISSION. THINGS GRAYSON MISS BAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS OF FIRST UP QUESTION THE AUTHOR. WITHOUT OBJECTION. AM I UNDERSTAND IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS IS A STATEMENT THAT. ARE THERE SOME PLACES THAT ARE NOT BUILDING ENOUGH HOUSING WHICH SPECIFIC AREAS. TO WHICH THIS BILL WOULD APPLY ARE NOT BUILDING ENOUGH HOUSING. THERE ARE TWENTY SIX PART STATIONS AROUND WHICH THERE ARE SURFACE PARKING LOTS AND IT'S AN ALL OF THOSE JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING AS YOU KNOW MANY IN YOUR DISTRICT. ARE THAT HAVE REFUSED TO BUILD HOUSING THAT WE THINK OUGHT TO BUILD HOUSING. AND DENSITY AROUND APART STATIONS THAT WE'VE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND WHAT WHAT SPECIFIC. MS BAKER LOCATIONS IS BIGGER WE GENERALLY DON'T. EXACTLY THE COLLOQUY AND BACK AND FORTH QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. I WOULD SUGGEST MAYBE AT PRESENT YOUR QUESTION MISTER CHIU CAN ADDRESS THAT IN HIS CLOTHES THEN YOU MAY PROCEED WITH THANK YOU ADDITIONAL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND I IF IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO ADDRESS IN THE CLOSE MY ADDITIONAL QUESTION WHICH WHICH. SPECIFIC CITIES WILL THIS APPLY TO WHICH SPECIFIC TOWNS HAVE NOT DONE THEIR PART AND ALLOWED TO THAT QUESTION. FOR THOSE FOR WHOM THE HALF MILE RADIUS IS OPEN SPACE. AND PARK LANDS WHICH PARKS AND OPEN SPACE WOULD BE PROPOSED TO TEAR UP. AND DATA AND ALLOW PART TO BUILD HOUSING ON MY OWN TIME. I RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION. TO THIS LEGISLATION FOR A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT REASONS FIRST AND FOREMOST IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. SECTION ELEVEN. ARTICLE ELEVEN SECTION ELEVEN SPECIFICALLY SAYS IN OUR CONSTITUTION THAT IT'S OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THEIR POLICE POWERS WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY INCLUDES. HOUSING. AND THERE'S A REASON WHY THIS MAKES COMPLETE AND TOTAL SENSE IN OUR CONSTITUTION AND THAT IS BECAUSE HOUSING WHAT YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD LOOKS LIKE HOW YOU'VE DESIGNED IT WHAT THE HEIGHT IS GOING TO BE WHAT THE DENSITY IS GOING TO BE THE PARKING AND THE EFFECT IT HAS ON YOUR. LOCAL COMMUNITY SHOULD BE DECIDED. BY THAT LOCAL COMMUNITY WHOSE BOARD MEMBERS WHETHER TO CITY COUNCILOR COUNTY BOARD ACTUALLY LIVE IN THAT COMMUNITY SO THIS BILL IN I REALIZE WE DON'T ALWAYS VOTE BASED ON WHETHER NOT SOMETHING IS CONSTITUTIONAL THIS BILL IS A COMPLETE VIOLATION. OF VERY EXPLICIT PROVISIONS OF OUR STATE CONSTITUTION BUT ASIDE FROM THAT. IF THIS WERE CONSTITUTIONAL THIS BILL IS ALSO WHEN I STRONGLY OPPOSE BECAUSE IT TAKES AN AGENCY THAT HAS ONE JOB AND THAT IS DELIVERING SAFE AND RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION. AND GIVES IT A COMPLETE EXPANDED AUTHORITY OVER SOMETHING IN WHICH IT HAS NO EXPERTISE AT ALL. YOU HEARD THE LANGUAGE HERE THAT THIS IS NARROWLY TAILORED THIS BILL IS NOT NARROWLY TAILORED IT SAYS TO A TRANSIT AGENCY UNIT MAY NOW BE THE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY. THAT IS GOING TO DECIDE HOW MUCH HOUSING IS WITHIN A HALF MILE OF APART STATION HOW DENSITY IS HOW MUCH IS AFFORDABLE WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS CERTAIN HEIGHTS HOW MUCH PARKING SPACES GO WITH IT. AND ALL OF THE ELEMENTS THAT GO WITHOUT. AND TRANSIT AGENCIES SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON DELIVERING RELIABLE CONTINUOUS AND SAFE SERVICE. NOW THIS IS BASICALLY LIKE TAKING. YOUR LOCAL DOG CATCHER. AND SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T THINK YOU'RE DOING THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WORK CORRECTLY WE KNOW BETTER THAN YOU SERVICE TAKE THE LOCAL DOT CATCHER AND PUT THEM IN CHARGE OF. YOUR FIRE DEPARTMENT. WHEN THE LOCAL DOG CATCHER HAS NO EXPERTISE AND HOW TO DO A FIRE DEPARTMENT AND IT'S WORSE. BECAUSE THE DOG CATCHER DOESN'T HAVE TO LIVE IN THE TOWN IN WHICH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS BECAUSE IN THIS BILL YOU CAN HAVE BART CONTROLLING HOUSING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR WHICH THERE IS ZERO REPRESENTATION ON THE BART BOARD. IF YOU'RE A PART DIRECTOR YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN THAT AREA WHERE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE CONTROL. SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY TELLING THEM THAT YOU WILL ALLOW BART TO CONTROL HOUSING IN YOUR AREA BUT BART DOESN'T HAVE TO LIVE THERE YES THERE'S A PART BOARD DIRECTOR WHO REPRESENTS A VARIETY OF TALENTS BUT THEY'RE GONNA BE MAKING THE DECISIONS FOR TOWNS I DON'T EVEN LIVE IN. SO EVEN IF IT WERE CONSTITUTIONAL EVEN IF IT MADE SENSE TO MAKE A TRANSIT AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR HOUSING THIS IS ALSO ABOUT BILL BECAUSE IT PUTS BART IN CHARGE OF HOUSING. BART HAS ENOUGH PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S GIVEN THE TRAINS TO RUN ON TIME GIVING THE DRUG ADDICTS OUT OF THE STATIONS ALL THROUGHOUT THE BAR AREA WHO ARE LINING. THE STATION'S AND FOR WHOM THEY CAN'T ENSURE SAFETY FOR THE WRITERS THERE IS A WRITER RECENTLY IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS WHO SITS ON A TRAIN AND SITS ON A. A NEEDLE FROM A HEROIN USER. BART HAS ENOUGH PROBLEMS WE NEED TO FOCUS ON GETTING THEIR ORIGINAL JOB DONE CORRECTLY. AND FINALLY. I ASK YOU MEMBERS IFYOU WOULD WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR DISTRICTS FOR THOSE MEMBERS WHO ARE BAY AREA MEMBERS YOU HAVE BART STATIONS ARE YOU READY TO GO BACK TO YOUR DISTRICT AND SAY. I'M SORRY SAN MATEO. I'M SORRY MILLBRAE THIRTY SECONDS I'M SORRY ANTIOCH AND I'M SORRY ALL THE OTHERS PLACES WHERE THERE'S A BART STATION NOW OR IN THE FUTURE WE DON'T THINK YOU'RE CAPABLE OF DOING YOUR JOBS ARE GONNA HAVE BART DO IT FOR YOU AND YOU CAN SAY NOTHING ABOUT IT. NOW IF YOUR ANSWER IS YES SIGN ME UP DO A DISTRICT BILL FOCUSED ON THOSE SPECIFIC STATIONS THAT YOU THINK ARE DOING THEIR JOB IF YOUR ANSWER IS NO. THEN VOTE NO ON THIS BILL DO NOT PUT PART IN CHARGE OF HOUSING IN THE BAY AREA I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU MS BAKER SEEN NO DISH I'M SORRY MISTER FRASIER'S RAISES MICROPHONE MISTER FRAZIER THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND. BEING THE FORMER TRANSPORTATION. CHAIR OF THESE COUNTY. TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. WE HAD AN ADDITIONAL BART STATION BROUGHT INTO ANTIOCH. FROM THE START BART WAS VERY VERY HESITANT. TO ADD ADDITIONAL PARKING SPACES MATTER OF FACT FOR A FOURTEEN THOUSAND A DAY RIDERSHIP PROJECTION. THEY ONLY WANTED TO PUT IN A THOUSAND PARKING SPACES AND THEY SAID OTHER PEOPLE WILL GET THERE. WHAT HAS BEEN A HABITUAL PROBLEM WITH THIS AGENCY AND DON'T GET ME WRONG THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD PURPOSE THE SHUTTLE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE BAY AREA? EVERY DAY. THAT TAKE THOSE% PEOPLE OFF THE HIGHWAYS AND THREE WASN'T. IN THAT DISTRICT. IN THAT AREA. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN VERY GLARINGLY A. AWARE IS THAT EVERY TIME THAT THEY DO PARKING. THEY DO A MINIMALIST APPROACH. AND NOW WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO IS SAY WELL. LETS MAKE IT SO NOBODY CAN GET THEIR CONVENIENCE AND CONNECTIVITY WILL GO AWAY. AND THEY ALSO AS I GREW MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE THE SAN RAMON VALLEY. THAT. NUMBER ONE. THEY ARE NOT COMPETENT TO BE HOUSING ELEMENT OF. PEOPLE. NOW THAT IS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT DECISION. THAT SHOULD BE KEPT IN THAT REALM. AND NEVER EVER BREACHED BY A TRANCE TRANSIT AUTHORITY. THEY WOULD PROVE THEMSELVES WHEN THEY DID SOMETHING WITH THE PLEASANT HILL. OF STATION IN. IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES AND NOTHING FLOUNDERED FOR MANY MANY YEARS UNDER THEIR. PROGRESS. I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND. WHY THEY'RE TRYING TO? BUT AGAIN. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND MAKE SURE THAT TRANSIT IS. IS CONNECTIVE HAS CONNECTIVITY. IT'S CONVENIENT. AND IF WE KEEP PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE WITH THE ROAD DIET. THAT THEY CAN'T GET THEIR IN PARK. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE USING THAT FACILITY. I URGE YOU. ABSOLUTELY RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE MAKING SURE THAT WE DO NOT CIRCUMVENT LOCAL CONTROL. THANK YOU. MS AGUIAR-CURRY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I TO OPPOSE THIS BILL I CAME TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE. IT ONCE AGAIN GOES TO THE COMMENTS THAT. MISS BAKER MADE REGARDING. LOCAL CONTROL. CONSTITUTIONALITY THAT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THE LOCAL CONTROL BASICALLY RAINES AND REMINDS ME OF WHO'S GETTING THE POWER IT GOES FROM LOCAL CONTROL THE BAR IS NOW BARGAIN HAVE MORE CONTROL THANLOCALS. AND I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'RE GONNA OPEN A CAN OF WORMS WE NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME ON THIS I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE HOUSING IS AT THE BEST SPOT JUST BECAUSE THE LOCALS DON'T WANT ME. WANT TO MOVE FORWARD ON HOUSING. LET THEM MAKE THAT DECISION SO AGAIN. I RESPECTFULLY WANT TO SAY THAT I MISTER CHIU MISTER GRACE WE HAVE LONG DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THIS BILL. A BUT AT THIS TIME I DO OPPOSE IT. ALL DEBATE AND DISCUSSION HAVING CEASED. YOUR CHIU YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER FIRST OF ALL COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION ON THIS THIS IS WHY IT'S BEEN SO CHALLENGING FOR US TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING. AND TRANSIT CONGESTION CRISES. AND AND I WANNA IN PARTICULAR I RESPECT THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM DUBLIN. I DO KNOW SHE'S RESPECTING THE PERSPECTIVE THAT HER DISTRICT HAS BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IS THAT PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY WE NEED THIS BILL. AND LET ME JUST PROVIDE A FEW FACTS OF IN CONTEXT AND I WANT TO ANSWER HER QUESTIONS ON THIS ONE TALK ABOUT WHAT CITIES. ARE NOT DOING LET ME TO SHARE SOME OF THE FACTS ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THE CITIES AND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SIXTEEN HAVE NOT DONE AROUND BART STATION. IN DUBLIN THIS PAST MARCH THE DUBLIN CITY COUNCIL VOTED DOWN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY UNITS NEAR THE DOUBLE IN PLEASANTON BART STATION. LAFAYETTE. A DIP A DEVELOPER RECENTLY HAD TO CHANGE PLANS FOR THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN UNITS TO REDUCE IT TO FORTY FOUR HIGH AND SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF A BART STATION. IN WALNUT CREEK THE SITE OF ANOTHER PART STATION THAT CITY KILLED HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ON A FORMER GOLF COURSE BY COLLECTING SIGNATURES TO PUT THE DEVELOPMENT. TO A PUBLIC VOTE. ANOTHER TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT PROJECT ON PARK LAND STARTED TO BE DEVELOPED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YEARS LATER HAS ONLY RECENTLY BROKEN GROUND. PLEASANTON AGAIN THE SIDE OF ANOTHER BART STATION HAS HAD AN ABSOLUTE HOUSING CAP FOR YEARS. JUST THIS PAST MONTH PART CHOSE NOT TO SUPPORT A NEW PROPOSED LIVERMORE PARK STATION WHICH DOLLARS IN PART. BECAUSE THAT CITY. IN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SIXTEEN DERAILED THE ORIGINAL PROPOSED SITE IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA. NOW LET ME JUST SUGGEST IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO ONE PART STARTED. MS BAKER IS THE POINT OF ORDER. POINT OF ORDER IF WE COULD PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THE AUTHOR IS FACTUALLY BASED AND RESPONDING TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL THIS DOES NOT GO TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL IT GOES TO FALSE INFORMATION SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LIVE IN THE DISTRICT AND KNOW. THAT IN FACT. IT IN THE LOCATION THAT WE'RE REFERRING TO HERE THEY HAVE APPROVED THEIR RINA NUMBERS THEY'VE MET. SEVEN YEARS IN ADVANCE. SO PLEASE SPEAK TO THE MERITS OF THE BILL AND BE BASED IN FACT ABOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH YOU ARE REFERRING.

TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BY COUNTY PROBATION IT IS NOT THE SAME THING AS PAROLE. SO. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS ARE. CAN INCLUDE HIGH RISK SEX OFFENDERS. AND THOSE WHO MOST RECENT HAD MOST RECENT CONVICTION FOR SERIOUS OR VIOLENT FELONY. STATE THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE THEIR SENTENCE WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED THIS IS A FURTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO REDUCE HOW MUCH TIME THEY'RE UNDER SUPERVISION. AGAIN PEOPLE WHO. ARE. THEY ARE ON PAROLE FOR A REASON. THEY'RE NOT ON POST COMMUNITY. I. RELEASE. FURTHER BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO VOTE ON THIS BILL AND I KNOW THERE. MEMBERS WHO ARE DISTRACTED WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER BILLS THAT COME UP BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO ME FOR ONE MINUTES. AND BECAUSE I HAVE A FEW EXAMPLES TO SHARE WITH THE OF THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT YOU WOULD BE ALLOWING TO BE TAKEN OFF OF PAROLE OP ED SUPERVISE PRO EARLY. LOVELL MIXIN VIOLATED PAROLE MULTIPLE TIMES AFTER BEING RELEASED FROM JAIL HE EVENTUALLY MURDERED FOR POLICE OFFICERS IN OAKLAND IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE. HE WAS ON PAROLE AFTER SERVING A SENTENCE OF SIX YEARS IN JAIL FOR ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON IN CONNECTION WITH AN ARMED ROBBERY IN SAN. CISCO DOCTOR EGGMAN STATE YOUR POINT OF ORDER. BUT MY POINT ORDER IS IF STEP THE THE AUTHOR OR THE. MY COLLEAGUES SPEAKING TO THE MERITS OF THIS BILL IS IN ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT SHE IS LISTING ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT THEN GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE DURING THEIR PAROLE. IF THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMPLETED ENTIRE PROGRAMS WELL UNDER PAROLE OR THESE ARE JUST PEOPLE WHO WERE ON PAROLE. DOCTOR EGGMAN NOT KNOWING THE SPECIFICS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. MS MELENDEZ IS BRINGING UP. I WAS GOING TO SAID THE POINT OF ARE NOT WELL TAKEN I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT MS MELENDEZ. A REFRAIN FROM ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENT BEYOND THE FOCUS OF THE BILL BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT. THAT WOULD YOU ARE. POINTING TO IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE ISSUES IN THIS BILL. THAT WOULD BE MY HOPE IF YOU ARE GOING TO PROCEED DOWN THIS LINE. MISS MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I MEAN THAT IS MY INTENT IS NOT TO JUST BRING FORWARD SOME I'M A RANDOM EXAMPLES BUT TO ILLUSTRATE THE TYPES OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS TYPE OF RELEASED BUT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS. I'M. WE HAVE ANOTHER. PERSON. FROM THOUSAND PALMS WHO WAS ON PAROLE FIRST SO WITH A DEADLY WEAPON ON MAY EIGHTEENTH HE OPENED FIRE INTO A CAR WITH FIVE CHILDREN AND IT. I'M VERY TRAGICALLY. A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD ANOTHER WHO IS IN AND OUT OF PRISON SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT A MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS LIKE UNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF A FIREARM BURGLARY. INFLICTING CORPORAL INJURY EARLIER THIS YEAR HE VIOLATED HIS PAROLE THEN LED POLICE OFFICERS ON THE DANGERS CHASE HEARINGS COUNTY HITTING SEVERAL OTHER DRIVERS. HE WAS CHARGED WITH AGGRAVATED ASSAULT ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON OCCURS ON AND ON AND ON. AND WE HAVE ANOTHER PERSON WHO WAS ON PAROLE FOR SECOND DEGREE MURDER IN GRAND THEFT AUTO WHILE ON PAROLE HE MURDERED HIS COUSIN AND THEN MURDERED WITH YOUR POLICE OFFICER KEITH BOYER AND SHOT THAT OFFICER PATRICK HITE HAZEL. SO I BRING THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION TO ILLUSTRATE AGAIN THE TYPES OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS TYPE OF. REDUCTION OF SUPERVISED PAROLE. THE. I I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY NOT A PERSON THE CHAMBERS WHO DOES NOT BELIEVE AND THEY'VE REDEMPTIVE QUALITY OF EVERY HUMAN BEING BUT I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS. ABOUT HOW WE WATER DOWN OUR LIVES AND HOW WE WATER DOWN THE ABILITY WITH WHICH WE CAN MONITOR THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO ALREADY HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD. OF WANTING TO DO HARM TO OTHERS. REMEMBER THIS IS PEARL THEY ARE NO LONGER INCARCERATED THIS IS NOT KEEPING THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO GET A JOB OR INTEGRATE BACK INTO THEIR FAMILIES IN THEIR SOCIETY AND COMMUNITY. BUT I THINK WE DO WANT TO BE CAREFUL WITHOUT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE BUT FOR YOUR YOU KNOW ABOUT. THANK YOU MS MELENDEZ DOCTOR CHOI. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

THE MOST VULNERABLE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. MANY ARE WORKING CLASS IMMIGRANTS OFTEN WORKING ALONE IN HOTEL ROOMS SOMETIMES OF MALE GAS PLACING THEM AT HEIGHTENED RISK OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OR HARASSMENT. A RECENT SURVEY OF CHICAGO AREA HOSTS HOTEL HOUSEKEEPERS FOUND THAT ALMOST HALF. OF ALL. HOTEL HOUSEKEEPERS HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR SEXUAL SO.

I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I HOPE BEFORE THIS BILL COMES BACK AT THE END OF SESSION. WE ARE PROVIDED WITH SOME CERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS FOR USING THIS TECHNOLOGY IN COMMUNITIES WILL BE. MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. AND I THERE'S A PROUD.

THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE BY MISTER GLORIA. CLERK WILL READ. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE BY SOME THE MEMBER GLORIA AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY THE MILITARY EQUIPMENT. MISTER GLORIA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I RISE TODAY TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES SUPPORT ON A BILL. THIS IMPORTANT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. RECOGNIZING THE HEIGHTENED TENSION BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. THEN PRESIDENT OBAMA O. CONVENED A FEDERAL INTERAGENCY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKING GROUP. UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER NUMBER THIRTEEN SIX EIGHTY EIGHT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. EXECUTIVE ORDER EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO BETTER COORDINATE FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN FEDERAL EQUIPMENT BY STATE LOCAL AND TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AMONG OTHER ISSUES THE WORKING GROUP DEVELOPED A LIST OF ITEMS THAT THEY DETERMINED AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO CERTAIN CONTROLS PRIOR TO THEIR TRANSFER TO OTHER AL ON FORSMAN EACH. SADLY LAST SUMMER THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION RESCINDED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ALONG WITH MANY OF THE OTHER POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS GOVERN APPROPRIATE CONSTITUTIONALLY SOUND USES OF CONTROLLED MILITARY EQUIPMENT. AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE REQUIRES THAT ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OBTAIN APPROVAL FOR THEM FROM THEIR GOVERNING BODIES PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT. EARLIER THIS WEEK I TOOK AMENDMENTS ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE ABOUT VAGUENESS OF CERTAIN TERMS AS WELL AS THE APPLICABILITY OF MUTUAL AID SITUATIONS. BY REQUIRING UP A PUBLIC FORUM TO ALLOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE DISCUSSIONS. THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN POLICE AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS SEEN AS A PUBLIC SERVICE RATHER THAN OCCUPYING FORCE I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA MISTER LACKEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YEAH I'VE SPOKEN TO THIS BEFORE I I TAKE IT AS AN AFFRONT. WHEN. BOND PORTION IS CHARACTERIZED AS THE ENEMY. WE'RE HERE. TO DO WHAT I SAY WE ARE NO LONGER MEMBER BUT. I'M RETIRED MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT WE. OUR GROUP OF PEOPLE THEY'RE WILLING TO DIE FOR THEIR COMMUNITY. AND. TO CHARACTERIZE THIS AS AN OCCUPYING FORCE IS OFFENSIVE AND I HOPE YOU VOTED DOWN JUST FOR THAT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WEBER YOUR RECOGNIZE. NOW MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE. ANY OF YOU HAVE SERVED ON THE SCHOOL BOARD BEFORE KNOW THAT THESE THINGS HAPPEN IN YOUR COMMUNITY THAT HAPPENED IN SAN DIEGO. WE DISCOVERED THERE WAS AN AWFUL LOT OF EQUIPMENT BROUGHT INTO THE SAN DIEGO CITY WAS PLACED IN SOME SCHOOLS SOME TANKS AND A HOST OF OTHER THINGS. AND THE PEOPLE ARE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT IT. A MUCH I DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE INPUT INTO WHAT THE PARENTS AND AS A RESULT. HIT DOES A LOT OF BLOWBACK TO IT WITHOUT ACTUALLY KNOWING WHAT WAS GOING ON IN DISCOVERING IT WAS IT WAS ALMOST LIKE IT WAS AN UNDERCOVER ACTIVITY THAT OCCURRED. NOT AS A FALL TO THE PLEASE ANYBODY ELSE WHAT THE SCHOOL BOARD SHOULD HAVE NOTIFIED INDIVIDUALS IF THEY WERE EVEN CONSIDERING DOING THIS. AND ALL AND SO I I SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE IT GIVES AT LEAST BUT I DO THAT THERE HAS TO BE POLICY. THERE HAS TO BE SOME COMMUNICATION WITH BOTH PARENTS AND WHOSE CHILDREN IN THOSE SCHOOLS SO THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR WHAT THEY'RE GETTING IN RETURN. AND I THINK IS JUST SO AS MOST OF YOU TALK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND YOU WANT FOLKS BUILDING IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD WHO DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ALSO WANT. OF FOLKS BRING IN MILITARY EQUIPMENT WITHOUT PARENTS KNOWING THAT IT'S AT THEIR SCHOOL THAT THE COMMUNITY KNOWS THIS THERE AND THIS IS REALLY ABOUT FAIRNESS AND OPENNESS WITH REGARDS TO. THE PARENTS AND THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY SO I SUPPORT A. B. THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE POSITION TO BE TAKEN IN ITS NOT POSED IN. THE HAVING IT'S REALLY TALKS ABOUT THE PROCESS STAR I HOPE THAT YOU WILL BOTH AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE SPECIALLY THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER EMIGRATE TO RESPECT MY COLLECTING SAN DIEGO INFORMING THE BILL FORWARD THINKER SOME ISSUES WITH THE PROPONENTS DIDN'T TALK ABOUT. THE BILL STATES ANY PERSON MAIN FORCES MEASURE AGREE A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. ACCORDING THE BILL ANYONE TO BRING A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COUNTY OR CITY. IF THEY FILL MILITARY TYPE% EQUIPMENT WAS NOT NEEDED BECAUSE THERE IS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE. OR IF THERE WAS OTHER COST EFFECTIVE OPTIONS. WITH THE EQUIPMENT WAS USED TO CRITICAL INCIDENTS AGREEMENT FOR A MYRIAD OF SUBJECTIVE MATTERS INCLUDING POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS. WITHOUT PROTEST THE BAY AREA AND MUTUALLY WHICH REQUESTED SO. SO WE CAN HAVE MUTUALLY AND USE SOME TYPE OF EQUIPMENT BELT OPEN THAT JURISDICTION THAT'S IN YOUR COUNTY. UP TO LAWSUIT. THE BILL GETS TEETH TO FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS AGAINST CITIES AND COUNTIES. FOR EXAMPLE. SO YOU CAN COUNTY WILL BE A RISK OF SO LAWSUIT SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS OPEN RIGHT HERE. RETAIN A VIOLENT PROTEST WE DO USE WHY GIVEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ALSO PERSONS COMMITTEE CLAIMS THAT THERE WAS MORE COST EFFECTIVE RESPONSES TREE CRITICAL INCIDENT. MOST LOVED ONE PERSON SEES CAN HAVE LONG GUNS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEY GOT. WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT? BULLET PROOF VEST HELMETS LA EQUIPMENT WITH THE LOWEST SHOOTING INCIDENTS WE HAVE RESCUE VEHICLES ARMORED CARS THAT COME UP. EVACUATE SOME THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS SO THEY'RE A GOOD EFFECTIVE TOOLS. AND. APART A POEM ALSO THE SHERIFF SHERIFF IS A CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER SO WHY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO ASSURE IF WE CAN OR CANNOT GET. SURE IF IS ALL TO BE RESPONSIBLE TO THE CITIZENS OF HIS COUNTY. SO I I THINK IS GOOD INTENTIONS HERE BUT. BUT I MEAN YEAH THERE ARE BAD ACTORS THE SWISS COMMUNITY ABSOLUTELY NOT. BUT FOR THE MOST PART MOST OF US COULDN'T IS USE. FOR GOOD EFFORTS. IT'S LIKE IN SECOND ROW COUNTY LAW DEPARTMENTS OFFICERS BY THEIR OWN WEAPONS BECAUSE YOU GET A BETTER WEAPON DEPARTMENT TO FOR TO GIVE YOU. THINK ABOUT OF SOMEONE'S BRING LONG GUNS ALL THE CARS WAS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A PIECE WITH OPTICS. THAT WE CAN THAT THE GENERAL FUND THAT'S WELL DEPARTMENTS RELY UPON SURPLUS MILITARY ITEMS SO. I THINK THIS COMMONSENSE WITH THIS IN MY AUTHOR I THINK ITS GOOD INTENTIONS. PROPONENTS WE DIDN'T. BIG THAT DEEP IN THE BILL WE HAVE THIS ISSUE BEFORE AND ULTIMATELY FOR SCHOOL SHOOTING HAPPENS. OR YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD YOU'RE TRAPPED IN YOUR HOUSE IT'S ALWAYS COME RESCUE GOODYEAR ARMOR TYPE VEHICLE. THERE I CAN GET IT LOT CHEAPER GIVEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE PIT OF QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE. FOR THAT VEHICLE AT YOUR GENERAL FUND. SO IT'S JUST UP THE THINK ABOUT THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS TO IT IS NOT THAT SIMPLE SO. ARE STRICTLY URGE YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU A SUMMER DAVID CHIU YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I WANT TO BUILD ON THE COMMENTS THAT WE JUST HEARD. THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT PREVENTS ANY LOCAL JURISDICTION FROM RECEIVING THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE ALL WANT TO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT IF THERE IS A SCHOOL SHOOTING THE TYPE OF ARMORED VEHICLES A TYPE OF WEAPONS THAT WE MIGHT NEED. ALL THIS BILL SAYS IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO RECEIVE THIS INFORMATION TO THIS THIS SO EQUIPMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS YOU NEED TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING. THERE NEEDS TO BE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF TRANSPARENCY THE REASON FOR THIS IS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BUILD TRUST BETWEEN THE PUBLIC. AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME OVERSIGHT ON WHY AND WHEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES MIGHT NEED TO ACQUIRE MILITARY GRADE WEAPONS. OUR CITIZENS ARE NOT ENEMY COMBATANTS ARE POLICE ARE NOT MILITARY GENERALS WE NEED THIS TRANSPARENCY AND BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REPEAL PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THIS IS WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY AT THIS TIME. I THINK AND I THINK WE ALL WOULD AGREE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TO BE A PARTNER IN PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE WEAPONS THAT THEY CARRY SHOULD REFLECT THAT REALITY. THIS BILL WILL HELP CREATE THAT TRANSPARENCY PROVIDE FOR THAT MEANINGFUL PUBLIC INPUT AND I'M PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHORED THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOME EVER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION AND. I'M QUITE FRANKLY I'M SICK OF HEARING ABOUT. HOW WE NEED TO? TAKE AWAY TOOLS FROM OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AYE WE NEED TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM. YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T ABOUT. LAW ENFORCEMENT INNER CITIZENS THIS IS ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL ELEMENTS. WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH THINGS LIKE CARTELS WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH. GANGS WERE DEALING WITH THINGS LIKE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. AND AS SO MY COLLEAGUES STATED EARLIER. YOU KNOW THIS IS ABOUT PROVIDING TOOLS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO KEEP OUR CITIZENS SAY. YOU CAN. DO A HEY LET'S HAVE A TOWN HALL TIME NOW THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON AND MAKE SURE WE CAN GET THE EQUIPMENT NEEDED. THE EQUIPMENTS NEEDED. IN AN EMERGENCY. AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE THESE TOOLS WE NEED TO STOP MAKING OUR PUBLIC. FEAR OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT IN FEAR THAT THE TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE TO USE. BELIEVE ME I'M I'M PRETTY SURE A LOT OF THEM WOULD PREFER NOT TO HAVE TO USE THESE TOLD THEM. PRETTY SURE THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD RATHER WORK WITH OUR SCHOOL CHILDREN AND OTHERS TO RELIEVE THAT FEAR. WE HAD HERE WE ARE AGAIN AS A BODY. TRYING TO DRAW DIVIDE BETWEEN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OUR COMMUNITIES WHEN WE NEED TO BE WORKING MORE TOGETHER. TO LESSEN THAT DIVIDE TO PROVIDE SECURITY TO OUR CITIZENS. YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY YOUR FOR MYSELF IS SO MANY THERE'S ACTUALLY SEEING COMBAT FIRST HAND. AND OF COURSE THE BODY CONTINUES TO TAKIN IN MOBILE OVER EACH OTHER. BECAUSE TO HAVE THE MEMBERS HERE DON'T EVEN REALLY CARE ABOUT WITH ACTUALLY GOING ON. SO. MEMBERS I I URGE YOU KNOW VOTE ON THIS I URGE THAT WE ACTUALLY. GIVE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT THE TOOLS NECESSARY. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU ARE HAVING OTHER CONVERSATIONS OBVIOUSLY DON'T CARE. ABOUT OUR CITIZENS ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT SO. ANYWAY ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU PLEASE GIVE YOUR FULL ATTENTION TO A SOME MEMBER CUNNINGHAM. MADAM SPEAKER. I JUST ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACT BEFORE WE VOTE TO ADD ANOTHER LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY. TO THE ACQUISITION OF. THINGS THAT OUR SHARES AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT NEED TO EFFECTIVELY KEEP PEOPLE OUR COMMUNITY. SAFE AND I THINK THAT'S. MAKE NO MISTAKE I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IT WOULD IMPACT TAKE THE DECISION MAKING OUT OF THE HANDS. OF OUR SHARES. AND PUT IT IN THE HANDS OF ANOTHER BODY. WE RECENTLY HAD MUDSLIDES IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WE RECENTLY HAD TERRIBLE FIRES IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY. THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT RESCUED PEOPLE USING HELICOPTERS IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEFINITION OF MILITARY GRADE EQUIPMENT THIS BILL IT INCLUDES AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS. INCLUDES THOSE THINGS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OUR SHARES USED TO GO SAVE PEOPLE THAT WERE TRAPPED IN A MUD SLIDE FIRE SITUATION. PLEASE ON BEHALF OF ALL OF ALL OF US THAT REPRESENT RURAL COMMUNITIES. THERE MAY BE ISOLATED LITTLE BIT MORE THAT SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE. PLEASE. DON'T VOTE FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE. IT WILL MAKE OUR CITIZENS LESS SAFE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. ARE YOU ARE YOU. NOT. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES SO I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE. I I'D LIKE TO SIMPLY JUST. CLARIFY. REGARDING A FEW STATEMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD I BELIEVE DISTORT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT ONE. THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT SAYS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CANNOT SECURE ON THE TYPE OF EQUIPMENT THEY NEED TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE THAT STATEMENT WAS MADE. AND IT DOES NOT DO THAT IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT THE GOVERNING BODY. OF MUSS I BE INVOLVED IN THE DECISION MAKING WHICH MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE IF COMMUNITY MEMBERS. HAVE A QUESTION OR CONCERN ABOUT WHY. TANK OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF EQUIPMENT WAS PURCHASE. THEY'RE GONNA GO DIRECTLY TO THE ELECTED GOVERNING BODY TO EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS. AND SO THERE SHOULD BE THAT LEVEL OF CONSULTATION. SECONDLY THE STATEMENT WAS MADE. THAT VOTING FOR THIS BILL MEANS YOU'RE AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THAT IS AN UTTER MISS CHARACTERIZATION OF WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WHAT THEY DO TO HELP KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE IN TO BE OUR PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY. OF THIS SIMPLY SAYS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE OF THE GOVERNING BODY HAS TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS DECISION MAKE DECISIONS MADE. TO ACQUIRE CERTAIN TYPES OF EQUIPMENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MELINDA'S YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT. EVERY CONTRACT SITTING CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THE PURCHASE OF THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT I KNOW MANY OF YOU WHO WERE ON CITY COUNCIL. RECALLED THE WARRANT LAST THAT YOU WOULD GET TO TO COUNCIL MEETINGS THAT LIST ALL OF THE THINGS THAT CHECKS WERE ISSUED FOR. AND WHAT YOU'RE CITY SPENT MONEY ON AND YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO QUESTION THAT. AND MOST POLICE CHIEFS ARE SMART ENOUGH OF THE GONNA MAKE A BIG PURCHASE PARTICULARLY SOMETHING LIKE I WANT TO KNOW SAY HELICOPTER. A BIT THEY'RE GOING TO RUN THAT PASTOR CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE THE CITY MANAGER SAID THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY AT LEAST WITH CONTRACT CITIES WERE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS FOR COUNCIL MEMBERS TO SAY NO WE DON'T FIND THAT THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE USE. OF CITY TAX DOLLARS OR WE DO I AM IN ADDITION NOT ONLY DOES THE CITY COUNCIL GET TO WEIGH IN ON THAT BUT ALSO THE CITIZENS. BECAUSE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS. SO I'M LIKE WHAT WE. ENGAGING APPEAR YOUR YOUR RESIDENTS COME FORWARD IN THE LIGHT YOU KNOW IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS EXACTLY HOW THEY FEEL. ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS THAT YOU'RE VOTING ON SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT FOR ONE THAT THIS IS NOT AN UNCHECKED SYSTEM I'M AS SOME MIGHT THINK THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KAMLAGER-DOVE YOU'RE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER YOU KNOW I WAS ACTUALLY ORIGINALLY GOING TO LAY OFF THIS BILL BUT AFTER READING AND TALKING TO THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS IT IS A GOOD BILL. IT IS A VERY GOOD BILL IT DOES NOT ADD AN EXTRA LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY. IT ADDS A LAYER OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. AND PART OF COMMUNITY SAFETY SHOULD INCLUDE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WE HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF YEARS. OF WATCHING. WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN COMMUNITIES ARE IN? RELATIONSHIPS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS OPENS THE DOOR. FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES IN OTHER COMMUNITIES TO BEGIN TO. HAVE A RELATIONSHIP AND ENGAGE IN THE KIND OF A PARTNERSHIP YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE WITH YOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. I REPRESENT THE CITY OF CULVER CITY AND WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH AN ISSUE AROUND THE PURCHASE OF DRONES AND THAT LITTLE CITY WANTS TO KNOW WHAT ITS POLICE DEPARTMENT IS DOING SO IT CAN BE HELPFUL. IN WORKING WITH ITS LAW ENFORCEMENT DESERVED DIVISION TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CITY AND ITS COMMUNITY RESIDENTS ARE SAFE SO I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT AB THREE THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY AS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. DECEMBER SECOND. CITY OF SAMBA DINO SUFFERED A TERRORIST ATTACK. BUT BECAUSE THE OUR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT OF POLICE DEPARTMENT HAD THE NECESSARY TOOLS THEY WERE ABLE TO ADDRESS AND PROTECT THOSE WHO'D BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS TERRORIST ATTACK. THE BILL CLEARLY DOES NOT TAKE THE RIGHT AWAY FROM MY CD IN MY COUNTY FROM GETTING THESE TYPES OF OF. SURPLUS ITEMS. SIMPLY SAYS THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS REPORTS ACTUALLY DONE. THE OUR OUR OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM VICTORVILLE. THERE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR COMMUNITY THEY ARE THERE TO SERVE AND PROTECT I WANT TO BE SURE THAT THEY HAVE. EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO SERVE AND PROTECT. BUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS JUST PROVIDES AN EXTRA. AND NEXT TO SAID A VOTE OF I USE IT BUT PROVIDES A TRANSPARENCY THAT EVERY COMMUNITY WANTS AND DESERVES. FOR THAT REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER OF THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER NOT. I TOO AM IN FULL SUPPORT. OF THIS BILL AND AND REALLY IT IS. ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL. AND IT'S A BAO. GOVERNING BODIES HAVING ABILITY AND DISSIDENTS THE RING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR CONTROL OVER WHAT GOES ON IN THE COMMUNITY. MANY OF YOU IN THIS IN THIS ON THIS FLOOR WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT CANNABIS AND OTHER THINGS YOU WANTED LOCAL CONTROL TO YOU COULD DECIDE WHAT TO DO AND HOW MUCH IT CAN BE REGULATED. YOU YOU ENJOYED MAKING SURE THAT YOUR LOCAL ENTITIES HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON WHAT TO DO. REALLY THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT. I KNOW YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT WE DON'T. WE SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT LET'S NOT. LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES EVERYONE IN THIS BODY DOES SUPPORT BUT WE ALSO TRULY TRULY. SUPPORT THE ABILITY ESPECIALLY ONES THAT HAVE BEEN ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. YOU KNOW YOU WANTED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND ESPECIALLY. WHEN IT COMES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT BOTH ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE IN THE CRIMINAL SIDE YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND HOW IT'S BEING ADDRESSED. AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT IS HAVING THE ABILITY TO HAVE LOCAL CONTROL TO MAKE DECISIONS ON WHAT YOU THINK. BEST FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. ALL DEBATE DISCUSSION HAVE INC CEASED MISTER GLORIA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE JUST VERY BRIEFLY MADAM SPEAKER I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE RECORD IS CLEAR AND I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DEBATE THAT WE HAD THIS AFTERNOON. IT SHOULD THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING WHATEVER WE TALK ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PROCUREMENT OF MILITARY GRADE EQUIPMENT. BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WITH THE GUARDS MIGHT MY GREAT COLLEAGUE FROM ELK GROVE WHO I DO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR WHOSE WALK IN THE SHOES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. I HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING BUT I WANT TO THE RECORD IS REFLECTIVE OF THE FACT THAT THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO OPEN THE FLOODGATES OF LITIGATION NOR WILL IT. A BY DOUG FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURES IN THIS BILL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE POLICIES THEY WISH TO FOLLOW WHICH I THINK AS THEY'D ADOPT THEM THE BILL TO FOLLOW THEIR OWN SETS OF POLICIES. PRETTY PRETTY SUCCESSFULLY I'M MEMBERS UNDERSTAND THIS MAY BE A DIFFICULT VOTE FOR SOME OF YOU. BUT I WANNA MAKE SURE VERY CLEAR ALSO THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE PROCUREMENT OF ANY ITEM BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS SIMPLY CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL CITY COUNCILS AND BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DEPARTMENTS ARE PROCURING. AS A FORMER CITY COUNCIL MEMBER I SPENT ENDLESS HOURS DISCUSSING HOW WE WOULD EVER REPLACE THE FORD CROWN VICTORIA IT WOULD IT BE A FORD EXPLORER OR DODGE CHARGER. WE HAD NEVER HAD A NEARLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PROCUREMENT OF LICENSE PLATE READERS. OF STINGRAY SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT THE LIST GOES ON AND ON I THINK OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE THIS INFORMATION I BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU'RE GIVING THAT INFORMATION THEY WILL AS THEY ALWAYS DO SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT WILL BE AFTER TO BUILD UP A BUS A ROBUST DISCUSSION THAT IS NOT HOW BEING HAD IN EVERY CITY HALL AND EVERY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. MEMBERS IS PRETTY SIMPLE I SIMPLY SAY THAT IF LAW ENFORCEMENT DETERMINES IT NEEDS MILITARY CALIBER EQUIPMENT I BELIEVE THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW. NOT ONLY WILL THIS CREATE MORE TRANSPARENCY BUT I BELIEVE ULTIMATELY WILL HELP BUILD TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE PEOPLE THEY ARE SWORN TO PROTECT I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

MY COMMITTED SPEAKER COLLEAGUES AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT IS ABOUT SECOND CHANCES AND PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK.

ALL TO OFTEN INDIVIDUALS ARE DENIED AN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE OR HAVE IT REVOKED OR SUSPENDED BASED ON PRIOR ARRESTS OR CONVICTIONS THAT ARE OLD. UNRELATED TO A JOB OR DISMISSED BY JUDGE. THERE'S AN IRONY THAT DUE TO THESE LICENSING BARRIERS. MANY WHO RECEIVE SPECIFIC JOB TRAINING WHILE INCARCERATED CAN'T GET A LICENSE TO DO THAT JOB WHEN THEY GET OUT. IN FIELDS LIKE COSMETOLOGY CONSTRUCTION LANDSCAPING AND AUTO REPAIR. THE INABILITY OF AN EX OFFENDER TO GET A JOB UPON REENTRY IS A SIGNIFICANT REASON OUR STATE HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RECIDIVISM RATES IN THE COUNTRY.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TWO EIGHTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN AN ACT RELATING TO ELECTIONS. SOME BERMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER NUMBERS. IN ALL BUT ONE STATEWIDE ELECTION SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA VOTES HAVE BEEN CAST ON VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS. CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY REQUIRES COUNTIES TO HAVE A FREE ACCESS SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS A VOTE BY MAIL VOTER. TO DETERMINE IF HIS OR HER BALLOT WAS RECEIVED BY THE ELECTIONS OFFICIAL AND IT WAS COUNTED. BUT OTHER JURISDICTIONS HAVE ADOPTED MORE EXTENSIVE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT TRACKING IN NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS THAT CAN% HELP IMPROVE VOTER PARTICIPATION AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS. THAT ARE INVALIDATED. AB TWENTY TO EIGHTEEN REQUIRES THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM FOR USE BY COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS THAT ALLOWS OF VOTER TO RECEIVE TEXT OR EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS. ABOUT THE STATUS OF HIS OR HER VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE POSTAL SYSTEM AND AS IT IS PROCESS BY THE ELECTIONS OFFICIAL. NOT ONLY WILL THE SYSTEM GIVE VOTERS GREATER PEACE OF MIND WHEN CASTING A BALLOT BY MAIL. BUT IT ALSO HELPS ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TAKE STEPS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS THAT ARE UNABLE TO BE COUNTED. AB TWENTY TO EIGHTEEN IS SUPPORTED BY SECRETARY OF STATE ALEX PADILLA AND HAS NO OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU S. SOME EVER HARPER YOU RECOGNIZE. YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS AS VICE CHAIR THE ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTION SYSTEM IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. BUT THIS BILL I BELIEVE IS UNNECESSARY VOTERS CAN ALREADY. I VERIFY WHETHER THEY'RE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT HAS BEEN COUNTED OR NOT THEY CAN VISIT THEIR COUNTY REGISTRAR'S WEBSITE TO CHECK ON THE STATUS OF THE BALLOT. ADDITIONALLY GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED A VERY SIMILAR BILL TO THIS ONE. AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTEEN WOULD IMPLEMENT A COSTLY SYSTEM THAT IS UNNECESSARY CONSIDERING THE READ CURRENT RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO VOTERS. NOW SPEAKER MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU A SOME MEMBER BAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT HAVE OF THIS BILL IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE I THINK IT'S ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT THE WAY WE HAVE CHANGED OUR LIVES IN CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECTIVOS BY MAIL BALLOTS. AND TO WITH ME ALL MAIL IN BALLOTS AND WHO CAN PICK UP YOUR BALLOT IN DELIVER YOUR BALLOT IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE INTEGRITY OF ELECTIONS THAT WE EMPOWER CALIFORNIA VOTERS TO BE ABLE TO CHECK IN THAT. THE SMARTEST FASTEST MOST EFFICIENT WAY POSSIBLE WHETHER THEY'RE BALLOT HAS BEEN RECEIVED AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THAT BALLOT NOT ONLY SO THEY ARE ARE HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. AND THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE TO CONFIRM THAT THERE BALLOT HAS BEEN PROPERLY HANDLED BUT THEY'RE ABLE TO TAKE THE QUICKEST ACTION POSSIBLE THAT YOU CAN DO IF YOU RECEIVE ELECTRONIC NOTIFICATION. AND ALSO BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN MEASURES THAT GO TO TRYING TO INCREASE VOTER TURNOUT. AND PARTICIPATION IN OUR ELECTIONS M. THAT I DON'T THINK ARE AFFECTED THIS IS ONE THAT I ACTUALLY THINK IS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE VOTERS WILL BE ABLE TO SAY I I'M ACTUALLY HEARING FROM MY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS PROACTIVELY AND WHEN I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE TOOLS WE CAN HAVE TO INCREASE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS IS MAKING SURE EVERY SINGLE VOTERS TOLD HATE YOUR BALLOT WAS OR WAS NOT RECEIVED WAS ACTUALLY REJECTED SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE MISTER BERMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM DOUBLE AND.

THIS BILL IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN AB TWENTY EIGHTY NINE WHICH WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR. AB TWENTY EIGHTY NINE REQUIRE COUNTIES TO NOTIFY VOTE BY MAIL BY VOTERS IF THEY'RE BALLOTS WERE NOT COUNTED. THAT BILL IMPOSED A STATE MANDATE WHICH AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTEEN DOES NOT. IN ADDITION THE SYSTEM REQUIRED UNDER AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTEEN WILL PROVIDE VOTERS WITH MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE ROBOT NOW BALLOTS. AND IMPORTANTLY WOULD NOTIFY VOTERS IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THEIR BALLOT WHEN THERE'S STILL TIME TO TAKE ACTION AND HAVE THAT BALLOT COUNTED. IF YOU SUPPORT TRYING TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO VOTE AND MAKING SURE THAT THE BALLOTS ACTUALLY COUNTED YOU SHOULD SUPPORT THIS BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

MR CLERK PLEASE CLOSE THE ROLAND TALLY THE VOTES EYES FIFTY NINE KNOWS ZERO THAT MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS ABOUT OBJECTION WE ARE MOVING BACK IN ORDER TO ITEM NINETEEN AB TWENTY NINE NINETY FIVE MISTER CLERK PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE NINETY FIVE BY SOME REMEMBER CARILLO AND OTHERS ARE NOT WILLING TO SIT ELECTIONS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CAREER YOU'RE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY NINE NINETY FIVE A MEASURE THAT EMPOWERS HOMEOWNERS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN. FROM THE DEVIL DEBILITATING EFFECTS OF LET LET PAINS IN THEIR HOMES. COLLEAGUES A CERTAIN PAINT MANUFACTURERS. CERTAINLY PAINT MANUFACTURERS KNOWINGLY SOLD THE PAINT FOR USE IN HOMES ACROSS THE STATE FOR DECADES AND WITH THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING. OF GENERATIONS OF FAMILIES THESE ARE FAMILIES THAT PUT THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY TOWARDS BUYING A HOME THE AMERICAN DREAM. ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN THEIR WALLS WERE COVERED IN A TOXIC. THAT WOULD AFFECT THEIR CHILDREN'S IQ LEVELS AND BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. WE SHOULD ALL BE OUTRAGED AND DEMAND THAT THESE COMPANIES BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. ON TOP OF THAT THE PERVASIVENESS OF LEAD PAINT IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR REVEALED A DISTURBING PRACTICE WHERE CERTAIN PAIN COMPANIES CONTINUOUSLY. PUT PROFITS ABOVE THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND HEALTH. IN RECENT COURT CASES IT WAS REVEALED THAT THESE GUILTY PAIN COMPANIES THOUGHT THIS US MOSTLY. PUBLICITY ISSUE NOT A PUBLIC HEALTH ONE. AND ADMITTED THAT MOST CASES OF LEAD EXPOSURE WERE OF LITTLE CONCERN. BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE HOMES OF. NEGRO AND PORTO RICAN FAMILIES. IN RESPONSE AB TWENTY NINE NINETY FIVE DOES TWO THINGS. FIRST IT CALLS OUT THE PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT FOR WHAT IT IS. A POISON THAT IS A DAMAGE TO PROPERTY AND A HEALTH HAZARD. THIS ENSURES THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN MOVE TO REMOVE LED BEFORE THEIR CHILDREN GET HURT. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEIR BABY TO GET POISONED BEFORE THEY CAN TAKE AN ACTION TO REMOVE THAT THREAT. SECOND THE BILL THAT THE CLEAR AND FAIR STANDARD FOR HOMEOWNERS TO TAKE ACTION. BY STARTING THE TIMELINE FOR HOMEOWNERS TO TAKE ACTION WHEN THEY HAVE A POSITIVE TEST OF LEAD PAINT IN THEIR HOME. WOULD GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO TAKE ACTION RIGHTS WHEN THEY NEEDED. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION THE CDC STATE THAT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD IN CHILDREN'S BLOOD. ANY AMOUNT NO MATTER HOW TRACE IS TOXIC. UNFORTUNATELY THESE INJURIES ARE FELT ALL ACROSS THE STATE FROM EUREKA TO SAN DIEGO IN LOS ANGELES THE CDC FOUND NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE FIVE PERCENT OF CHILDREN. HAD ELEVATED. LEVELS OF LEAD. IN SOME AREAS THE FRESNO THIRTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT OF CHILDREN TESTED HAD ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS. NEARLY THREE TIMES THE RATE FOUND IN FLINT MICHIGAN DURING THE CITY'S WATER CONTAMINATION CRISIS LET ME REPEAT THAT AGAIN. NEARLY THREE TIMES THE RATES FOUND IN FLINT MICHIGAN. THE SHEER GRAVITY OF THIS ISSUE DEMANDS ACTION AND THIS BILL WILL ENSURE HOMEOWNERS HAVE THE LEGAL POWER TO PROTECT THE SAFETY. NOT ONLY OF THEIR HARD EARNED PROPERTIES BUT MOST CRITICALLY OF THEIR FAMILY AND LOVED ONES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MEMBERS PLEASE GIVE YOUR ATTENTION TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS AFTER THIRTY FIVE YEARS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN TWENTY THREE YEARS AS A CONTRACTOR. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WE'RE TAKING THE WRONG APPROACH. ADD THIS LEAD BASED BILL. LISTEN. THE FOR THE PEOPLE WE WANT TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE THAT ELECTED US TO BE HERE THE CONSUMER. WE DON'T WANT TO PROTECT THE PAINT COMPANIES AND WE DON'T WANT TO PROTECT THE TRIAL LAWYERS WE WANT TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE WHOSE VALUE OF THEIR HOMES. WILL BE DIMINISHED. BY THIS PROCESS WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS START OVER AND START LOOKING AT WHAT THE COST WILL BE TO REMEDIATE LEAD. IN THESE PRE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE HOMES. THIS MONEY COULD BE ABSOLUTELY OUT OF REACH IF WE DO NOT LOOK. AT THE ABSOLUTE COST. SOME OF THESE HOUSES HAVE WINDOWS THAT ARE COMPLETELY WOULD WAINSCOTING CROWN MOLDING SIX PANEL DOORS. THE COST COULD BE ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL. BUT IF WE LOOK AT IT INCOME FROM THIS APPROACH WE COULD BE GIVING MONEY TO PEOPLE. COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS IF IT WAS A FORTY THOUSAND DOLLAR BILL AND THEN DUMP THE PUBLIC NUISANCE BURDEN ON THE. CONSUMER. THAT'S NOT FAIR. WE NEED TO BE ABLE THE START OVER PROTECT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE WERE ELECTED TO PROTECT. THIS IS THE WRONG APPROACH I BEG YOUR INDULGENCE TO REFUSE THIS BILL AND WE START OVER IN A PROCESS THAT DOES. PROTECT THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE HOLD DEAR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I COLLEAGUES I KNOW ALL OF US HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND WHAT I WOULD ASK EVERYONE. TO THINK ABOUT IS HOW INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IT IS. AFTER DECADES OF FAMILIES AND CHILDREN BEING POISONED BY MANUFACTURERS WHO KNOWINGLY DECEIVED THE PUBLIC. AND AFTER A TWENTY YEAR LAWSUIT TO HOLD THESE COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE. THESE COMPANIES ARE CONTINUING TO DECEIVE THE PUBLIC. AND I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST TO SEE PAUL DID TO SEE POLICYMAKERS HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I'VE PLENTY OF DOCUMENTS TO. EXPLAIN I THINK WE ALL DO OF WHY THE DECEPTION IS OCCURRING. BUT I WOULD AGREE WITH THE LAST SPEAKER ARE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US IN THE COMING WEEKS IN THE COMING MONTHS. TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THAT AND THAT IS WHY I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT WITH THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL TO MOVE IT FORWARD. WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS CONVERSATION GOING. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THIS THE WHOLE PIC COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE IF WE DO NOT IF WE DO NOT ACT. DURING THIS SESSION IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT THESE PAINT COMPANIES WILL COMPLETELY BE ABSOLVED OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY COMPLETELY BE ABSOLVED OF THEIR LIABILITY. AND THAT. THAT'S. PENALTY. COULD. LEYVA ON THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA BY THE END OF THIS YEAR THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO ACT THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO MOVE THIS FORWARD TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION FOR GOING. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AYE VOTE. SEEING NO FURTHER REQUEST TO SPEAK ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARILLO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN A A LONG PROCESS TO GET HERE. I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALL WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR AMERICAN DREAM. OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. THIS IS WHY EVEN THE REALTORS ASSOCIATION PHI MAY READ. WITHOUT OBJECTION. STATED IN IN A STATEMENT THAT PAYING COMPANIES ARE USING SCARE TACTICS ON CALIFORNIANS TO COVER FOR THEIR OWN WRONGDOING. TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. WE ALL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE PROTECTED. THIS IS ABOUT HOW WE AS A BODY ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT PAIN COMPANIES PURPOSELY SOLD PAINTS WOULD LEAD. TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR STATE. HOW ARE WE GOING TO TURN TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND SAY THAT WE PREFERRED TO BE WITH THE PAIN COMPANIES? VERSES THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO THINK LONG AND HARD. ABOUT WHAT THIS BODY REPRESENTS. HOW WE PROTECT CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS HOW WE PROTECT FAMILIES AND HOW WE PROTECT CHILDREN?

THE FLEXIBILITY SUPPORTED A SAN MATEO AND SUBSEQUENTLY SAN FRANCISCO WERE SO SUCCESSFUL THAT TODAY THERE ARE A TOTAL OF THIRTEEN COUNTIES THAT ARE ABLE TO USE OUR INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAMS TO SAID EXCEPTIONS. STATEWIDE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAMILIES LIVING IN RECEIVING SERVICES IN THOSE COUNTIES. UNFORTUNATELY THOSE EXCEPTIONS ARE CREATED INEQUITIES AMONG COUNTIES. AFTER WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE A LEGISLATURE THE PILOT COUNTIES AND A CHILD CARE STAKEHOLDERS TO STREAMLINE THE PROGRAMS THE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTIONS OFFICE HAS IDENTIFIED THE AREAS.

ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY ONE TEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MULLIN OTHERS AN ACCOLADE TO ATHLETIC TRAINERS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT DOES NOT REGULATE THE PROFESSION OF ATHLETIC TRAINING. AB THIRTY ONE TEN ESTABLISHES THE ATHLETIC TRAINING PRACTICE ACT THE BILL CREATES THE BOARD OF ATHLETIC TRAINING. ANY REGISTRATION MECHANISM TO REGULATE ATHLETIC TRAINERS IT ALSO PROTECTS THE ATHLETIC TRAINER TITLE FOR THOSE WHO ARE NATIONALLY CERTIFIED. ATHLETIC TRAINERS ARE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE OFTEN CHARGED WITH MANAGING SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS CONCUSSIONS HEAT ILLNESS SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST. AS WELL AS MUSCULOSKELETAL ISSUES LIKE DISLOCATIONS AND FRACTURES CURRENTLY THERE IS NO ACCURATE SYSTEMIC WAY FOR THE PUBLIC TO REPORT EVIDENCE OF HARM AGAINST ATHLETIC TRAINERS. FOR THOSE POSING AS ATHLETIC TRAINERS AND HAVE THOSE REPORTS TRACKED THERE'S ONLY ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AB THIRTY ONE TEN REQUIRES THAT THOSE PROVIDING ATHLETIC TRAINING SERVICES REGISTER WITH THE BOARD OF THAT ATHLETIC TRAINING. WHICH WILL MAINTAIN INFORMATION ON ATHLETIC TRAINERS WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED AND THE SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE. THE BILL ALSO RESERVES THE ATHLETIC TRAINER TITLE FOR THOSE WHO ARE NATIONALLY CERTIFIED. A CALIFORNIA INTERSCHOLASTIC FEDERATION SURVEY OF ATHLETIC DIRECTORS WITHIN APPROXIMATELY NINETY FIRST NINETY PERCENT RESPONSE RATE INDICATES THAT THERE ARE ATLEAST ONE HUNDRED FIFTY HIGH SCHOOLS CURRENTLY EMPLOYING AN INDIVIDUAL. WHO IS PRACTICING AS AN ATHLETIC TRAINER WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE EDUCATION AND TRAINING? THIS MEANS ATHLETES MAY BE UNDER THE CARE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO LACK THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO ACT AS AN ATHLETIC TRAINER. THE INTRODUCED AB THIRTY ONE TEN AS A LICENSE YOUR BILL I ACCEPTED MAJOR AMENDMENTS IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE TO SCALE BACK SIGNIFICANTLY. THERE'S A MISCONCEPTION THAT% THIS IS STILL A LICENSE YOUR BILL. IF YOU REHABILITATE OFF YOU'LL SEE THAT IS NOT A LICENSE REBEL THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A REGISTRATION MECHANISM FOR ATHLETIC TRAINERS. AND RESERVES THE ATHLETIC TRAINER TITLE FOR THOSE WHO ARE NATIONALLY CERTIFIED AND REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT STEP. IN THE RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CALIFORNIA'S IN THE ROLE PLAYED BY CALIFORNIA'S ATHLETIC TRAINERS AND I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE SIXTY FOUR BY SOME REMEMBER BLOOM ANOTHER'S AN ACCOLADE TO HOUSING. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I'M A VERY PLEASED TO BE PRESENTING THIS BILL AND. LET ME START BY LETTING YOU KNOW THAT MY OFFICE HAS COME TO AGREEMENT WITH THAT OPPOSITION ON THIS VERY CONTENTIOUS BILL INVOLVING THE ELLIS ACT AND IT'S A. NEEDED REFORM CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OF GREATER LOS ANGELES AND OTHERS ARE NO LONGER IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS WE'VE AGREED TO AMENDMENTS WHICH WE WILL TAKE IN THE SENATE. THE ELLIS ACT EXPRESSLY PROHIBITS WITHDRAWING LESS THAN ALL THE UNITS FROM THE RENTAL MARKET AND THE LAW IN THE CASE THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE WITHDRAWAL DATE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CALCULATING RENTAL AMOUNTS. WHEN UNITS ARE RE OFFERED FOR RENT BUT THERE IS ALSO LANGUAGE GOVERNING THE TENANTS LEASE TERMINATION DAY. THAT SEEMS TO ALLOW MULTIPLE WITHDRAWAL DATES IN ADDITION THERE'S NO PROVISION THAT SPECIFIES THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE DAY. THAT APPLIES OF THE PROPERTIES PUT BACK ON THE RENTAL MARKET. AS A CONSEQUENCE SOME LANDLORDS HAVE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS CONFUSION AND REMOVED UNITS FROM THE RENTAL MARKET. RETURNING THEM IN A PIECEMEAL FASHION AND THEREBY AVOIDING THE ACT'S RESTRICTIONS INNOVATING RENT CONTROL. THEY ARE ALSO OR HAVE ALSO APPLIED DIFFERENT WITHDRAWAL DATES TO DIFFERENT UNITS. AND CLAIMING THAT RETURNING ONE UNIT TO THE MARKET DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE LANDLORD TO RE OFFER OTHER UNITS TO FORMER TENANTS. THIS IS ALLOWED LANDLORDS TO EFFECTIVELY WITHDRAWAL LESS THAN ALL THE UNITS FROM THE RENTAL MARKET AND IN FACT. NEVER ACTUALLY LEAVE THE RENTAL MARKET AT ALL WHILE STILL HAVING SUCCESSFULLY EVICTED ALL THE EXISTING TENANTS IN INCREASING RANTS AGAIN CONTRARY TO THE INTENT. THE VERY CLEAR INTENT OF THE ALICE ACT. ACCORDING TO THE RIGHT CONTROL JURISDICTION'S THE COURTS ARE MISINTERPRETING THE LAW AS A RESULT OF SOME A A VERY FEW NUMBER OF LANDLORDS. SO IT'S EVEN MORE IMPERATIVE TO CLARIFY WHAT THE LAWS MEANT ALL LONG. THIS IS BEEN A DIFFICULT AND VERY TENSE CONVERSATION. BETWEEN TENANT ADVOCATES AND LANDLORDS. AND THIS BILL GIVES TENANTS SOME SECURITY IN KEEPING THEIR HOMES AT A TIME WHEN HOMELESSNESS FOR OUR POOR SENIORS DISABLED AND EVEN WORKING CLASS. IS A REALITY. AND MANY TIMES FOLKS RE JUST A PAYCHECK OR RENT INCREASE AWAY. I FROM HOMELESSNESS TO THE LACK OF ROOM READILY AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHEN THEIR DISPLACED AS A RESULT OF THE ELLIS ACT. SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU THANK A MENACE BAKER COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I WANNA JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WORK IN ADDRESSING AND WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL TO WHERE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET. A WHEN THE METS NOT JUST OF THE MOST INTENSE HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY BUT A SEVERE TENDING CRISIS AND ADDICTION CRISIS. THE ELLIS ACT WAS INITIALLY LEGISLATED TO ALLOW PROPERTY OWNERS TO LEAVE THE RENTAL MARKET A BUT I THINK MANY CAN AGREE THAT IT HAS BEEN GAINED IN RECENT YEARS. ARE IN CITIES THAT DO HAVE RENT CONTROL THIS BILL STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN TENANTS AND LANDLORDS RIGHTS AND AS A JOINT AUTHORED THIS BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EVERYONE'S AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I BELIEVE THAT TEN YEARS WAITING IS MUCH TOO LONG I THINK THIS IS A DISTORTION OF THE MARKET. I IN FACT I CREATES DISINCENTIVES ALL ON CREATING NEW HOUSING WITH IN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK IT ACTUALLY EXACERBATE THE HOUSING CRISES WITH OUR STATE. LET'S NOT VIOLATE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF PROPERTY OWNERS WITHIN CALIFORNIA LET'S THE FAN THEM AN INCREASE I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO INVEST IN HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SEEING NO FURTHER REQUEST TO SPEAK. MISTER BLOOM WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CLERK PLEASE OPEN THE ROLL-ON MEMBERS VOTE. DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE. WHO DESIRE TO VOTE? ALL MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE MISTER BLOOM LOOKED SO CALL THE RULES COMMITTEE WILL BE MEETING IMMEDIATELY IN THE RULES COMMITTEE ROOM.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TO FORTY SEVEN. WHICH WILL ENSURE FOSTER YOUTH ARE NOT UNNECESSARILY MOVED FROM ONE PLACE IT. TO THE OTHER. THIS BILL CREATES A PROCESS FOR PLACEMENT CHANGES AND REQUIRES. SOCIAL WORKERS TO CREATE A PLAN. WITH CONFLICT RESOLUTION PRACTICES. LET ME PAUSE FOR A MOMENT. IN THE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE. WE HAD. A YOUNG LADY. TO COME AND TESTIFY. WELL THIS BILL. SHE WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD. SHE'D ALREADY BEEN. MOVE THIRTY TWO TIMES. A FOSTER YOUTH BEING MOVED THIRTY TWO TIMES. THE LAST TIME. THE SOCIAL WORKER CAME TO HER HIGH SCHOOL. BROUGHT THREE TRASH BAGS WOULD HER BELONGINGS IN THIS. IN THOSE TRASH BAGS. THAT OUR SHOES. SOME CLOTHES. THIS IS A FOSTER YOU'VE.

YOUR WHOLE THIRTY TWO TIMES THERE'S NO STABILIZATION THERE. THERE'S NO CONTINUITY. YOU'RE BEING STRIPPED FROM ANY FRIENDS OR FAMILIES YOU MAY HAVE GATHERED ALONG THE WAY THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS IN PORT TO CREATE. SUCH A STRUCTURE. SO TWENTY TWO FORTY SEVEN IS A SAFE AND THOUGHTFUL BUILD DEVELOP BY YOUTH. WHO ARE FOSTER YOUTH WHO HAVE BEEN FOSTER YOU'VE AND THAT BILL IS BEFORE US TODAY? THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED NO OPPOSITION. AND HAS RECEIVED A BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN OUR RESPECTFULLY ASK WHERE I VOTE ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TO FORTY SEVEN. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THINK YOU BETTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AYE AYE AYE RISE JUST AT THE TO RAISE A POINT I I UNDERSTAND THE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE ISSUE. BUT I WOULD ALSO OFFER TO YOU THAT YOU TALK TO ANY ONE OF YOUR COUNTIES. YOU TALK TO YOUR SOCIAL WORKERS WORKING IN CPS. AND YOU ASK THEM WHAT THEIR CASELOADS ARE. IT SHOULD BE ABOUT FIFTEEN TO ONE. OFTENTIMES IT'S A HUNDRED TO ONE. SOCIAL WORKERS ARE UNDERPAID OVERWORKED DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO SPEND THE TIME WITH KIDS THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH FOSTER HOME PLACEMENTS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE A CHILD FROM ONE SAFE ENVIRONMENT TO ANOTHER. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES TO HELP THOSE FOSTER THE BEHAVIORS THAT ARE FOSTER YOUTH COME TO US AFTER THIRTY TWO MOVES THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF TRAUMA THAT HAS OCCURRED IN THAT CHILD'S LIFE. THAT THEY NEED INCREDIBLE WRAPAROUND SERVICES SO A SOCIAL GREW HAS THAT CHILD WOULD NINETY NINE OTHERS ON THEIR CASE LOAD IT IS VERY DIFFICULT SO WELL I SUPPORT THIS BILL I JUST THINK ADDING MORE. REQUIREMENTS FOR SOCIAL WORKERS DOES NOT REALLY ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING ISSUE OF THE LEVEL OF POVERTY THAT EXIST IN OUR DISTRICTS THAT CREATE A OFTENTIMES. ENVIRONMENTS FOR ABUSE TO OCCUR BUT THAT IT IS FINE TO BE ABLE TO SAY WE NEED TO DO MORE FOR OUR FOSTER KIDS BUT IT WE CAN'T ADDRESS THE RATIOS THAT EVERYBODY HAS SAID WE'RE NOT DOING RATIOS. FOR FOSTER KIDS AND CPS WORKERS THEN WE ARE JUST CREATING ANOTHER ISSUE I AM COURAGE AYE VOTE ON THIS AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHO WHO ARE PLACING THE BURDEN TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE. WHEN THERE ARE DOING A WHOLE LOT WITH WITH WITH NOT MUCH THANK. THANK YOU SEEING THAT NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SURLY APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE. OF FOR MAKING US AWARE OF A GREATER NEED IN THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THIS THIS PARTICULAR AREA BUT UNTIL SUCH TIME COMES WE ARE STILL HAVING FOSTER YOU. BEING DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED BY HAVING THEIR ENTIRE LIVES STRIPPED AWAY MULTIPLE TIMES WHERE THEY CAN NOW LONGER. HAVE FRIENDS ON GO TO CHURCHES AND WHICH OF THEIR FOSTER HOME I'M IS IN THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY THEY'RE BEING BOUNCED AROUND MAKE IN THEIR TRAUMA CONTINUES. TO FASTER CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND SO THIS BILL HELPS CREATE A CERTAINLY A STRUCTURE WITH SOCIAL WORKERS. HAVING THE INPUT TO PROVIDE A A BENCHMARK. BEFORE A CHILD IS ACTUALLY BEING MOVED FROM ONE HOME TO THE OTHER KEEP IN MIND THAT THE CHILD HAS TO BE REMOVED FOR SAFETY REASONS THEY STILL HAVE THAT ABILITY TO DO THAT. ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A PROVIDE SOME KINDA STABILIZATION STRUCTURE FOR CHILD TO GROW UP JUST LIKE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN'S HAVE THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT IN OUR OWN HOMES I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHAT I BOTH. A TWENTY TO FORTY SEVEN. NAMES GIPSON WITH THAT CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. I'M MEMBERS. DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. CLARK WELL. CLOSER ROLE. TELEVOTE. AYE SIXTY TWO NO ZERO. THAT MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS ARE FILE ITEM ONE TWENTY SEVEN AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX CORKERY. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX BY SOME REMEMBER BURKE ANOTHER SNACK RELATE TO INSURANCE. MS BURKE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX. I AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX IS THE RESULT OF MANY HOURS OF STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS THAT INCLUDED POLICY AND FISCAL COMMITTEE STAFF MEMBERS AND DEPARTMENT INSURANCE AND ALL INTERESTED PARTIES. AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX PROVIDE STATUTORY CERTAINTY ON HOW AN INSURER WILL CONDUCT ELABORATE SURVEY TO DETERMINE THE PREVAILING AUTO BODY LABOR RATE IN A SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC LABOR MARKET. LIBERATE SURVEYS ARE NOT MANDATED BUT INSURANCE I DO CAN TALK TO VOLUNTARY SURVEY USE IT AS A TOOL FOR TWO MAJOR REASONS THE FIRST TO FIGURE OUT WHAT A FAIR PRICE TO PAY IN A LOCATION FOR RUN OF THE MILL REPAIR JOBS AND THE SECOND. TO PROVE TO THE PART INSURANCE AN INSURER ACTED FAIRLY IN THE EVENT AN AUTO BODY REPAIR SHOP COMPLAINTS TO THE DEPARTMENT. AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY SIX PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGY TO CONDUCT A VOLUNTEER LABOR RATES SERVING. PACIFIC LENA AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX ADOPTS THE LOCAL WORK DEVELOPMENT AREAS ESTABLISHED BY THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AS THE LABOR MARKET OF AUTO BODY SHOPS. THAT WOULD BE SURVEY BY THE INSURER THERE WAS AN AMENDMENT OUT OF ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WITH THE INTENT LANGUAGE THAT WILL MAP. THAT MAP WILL FURTHER BE DEFINED THE BILL ALSO SPECIFIES THAT ONLY QUALIFIED BODY SHOPS MAYBE SURVEYED THAT SURVEY RESPONSES SHOULD BE NOT INCLUDED ANY DISCOUNTED RATES AND THE EXACT QUESTIONS THAT MUST BE INCLUDED ON EACH SERVING. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL REQUIRES THAT CPAS SPECIALTY REPAIR SHOP BE HANDLED ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS BETWEEN THE INSURER AND THE AUTO BODY SHOP. A PREVAILING LABOR RATE DETERMINED BY A SURVEY IS A STARTING POINT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN AN AUTO BODY SHOP AND THE INSURER. AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX STATES THE PREVAILING AUTO BODY YOU LABOR RATES SURVEYS RESULTS SHALL NOT BE PRESUMED TO BE A MAXIMUM OR MINIMUM. THAT SHOULD BE PAID TO SETTLE A SPECIFIC CLAIM IS SIMPLY A STARTING POINT TO BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS. AS A RESULT OF EXTENSIVE NEGOTIATIONS A NEW CAR DEALERS ARE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION FOR THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. NICHOLAS BERG MISTER DALY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL I RISE IN SUPPORT. THIS BILL'S GOAL IS A FAIR BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT BODY SHOPS GET PAID TO FIX OUR CARS AND WHAT INSURANCE POLICY POLICYHOLDERS HAVE TO PAY IN PREMIUMS. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AMONG ALL INTERESTED PARTIES. THOSE MEETINGS HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN PRODUCTIVE THANKS TO THE AUTHOR MISS BURKE. THIS IS VERY VERY CHALLENGING ISSUE AND MORE WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE I'M CONFIDENT SHE WILL FINISH OFF THIS. THIS A CHALLENGING PROJECT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. COOLEY. YOUR RECOGNIZE. COLLEAGUES ARE RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IT IS LONG BEEN A FEATURE OF CALIFORNIA'S INSURANCE CO DATING BACK TO THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS. THAT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER JOB IS TO. ADMINISTERING. THAT DEPARTMENT ACCORDS WITH STATUTE. SO THIS TAKES AN AREA WHERE THERE'S BEEN SOME DISPUTE AND PROVIDES CLEAR STATUTORY GUIDANCE. THIS IS VERY MUCH THE APPROACH UNDER THE CODE GENERALLY IN CALIFORNIA. THE LEGISLATURE GIVES GUIDANCE TO THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WHO THEN BECOMES A CODE ADMINISTRATOR TAXI TWELVE NINE TWENTY ONE A OF THE CALAVERAS INSURANCE CODE WHICH STATES.

ALL WITHOUT HIS PARENTS CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE THOSE ITEMS ARE ILLEGAL TO SELL TO ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. HOWEVER IN THIS SITUATION A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WAS ABLE TO BUY THESE ITEMS BECAUSE. THERE WAS NO CHECK TO SEE IF THE PURCHASER WAS OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. THE BILL AB TWENTY FIVE ELEVEN WOULD REQUIRE ONLINE RETAILERS.

THAT MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO WITHOUT OBJECTION MOVE TO TAKE UP FILE ITEM NUMBER. EIGHTY THREE THIS IS FILE ITEM EIGHTY THREE AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY FIVE BY MISTER KALRA THE CLERK WILL READ. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR FIFTY FIVE BY SIMPLY MEMBER KALRA AN ACCOLADE HOME CARE SERVICES. MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS UP. IS I BILL TWENTY FOUR TO DEFY THE LAWS CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO PROVIDE UPON REQUEST WERE SPECIFIED THEY'VE ORGANIZATION. A RECORD OF ONLY THE NAME AND PHONE NUMBERS OF. AND PHONE NUMBER OF NEWLY REGISTERED TO REREAD XIN HOME CARE AIDES. THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT A LABOR ORGANIZATION FROM SHARING OR USING THIS INFORMATION FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN EMPLOYEE TRAINING ORGANIZED REPRESENTATION. AND ASSISTANCE. LAST YEAR I AUTHORED AB FIFTEEN THIRTEEN WHICH WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN THAT HOME CARE AIDES WERE ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM WERE NOT AWARE. OF OTHER INFORMATION WOULD EVENTUALLY BE DISCLOSED OF ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS ARE MAKING AB TWENTY FOUR OF. FIFTY FIVE A PERSPECTIVE MEASURE THE SHARES ONLY INFORMATION I'M REALLY REGISTERING OR RE REGISTERING HOME CARE AIDES AN OPT OUT PROVISION ALLOWS ANY HOMECARE AIDE TO CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE. AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE GRAMS HOME CARE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT FROM TRAINING AND ORGANIZE THAT MAY NOT BE READILY AVAILABLE TO THEM. THESE SERVICES CAN HELP HOME CARE AIDES ADVANCE THEIR CAREERS INCREASED LEVEL OF CARE THEY PROVIDE THAT ARE INVALID UP TO THE STATE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS OUR AGING POPULATION CONTINUES TO INCREASE. ADDITIONALLY OB. THIS IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY PRICKLY FOR MANY OF THOUGH HOME CARRY COMPANIES THAT MIGHT BE STRUGGLING. AT THIS TIME TO WORK. WITH LABOR ORGANIZATIONS TO ENSURE GOING FORWARD THAT THERE ARE PROPER. BOTH BURKE ISSUES THAT ARE DEALT WITH AS WELL AS WELL AS OF ISSUES REGARDING TIME LINES THAT ALLOW FOR MORE OF OUR ELDERLY TO HAVE CARE. THEN THE RESTRICTIONS THAT CURRENTLY OF MIGHT EXIST FROM THE STATE WITHOUT ARE SIMPLY ASPIRIN AIBO. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA MISS. MISS MILK THIS MELENDEZ. IT'S GOMEZ BAKER. MISS BAKER THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THIS BILL. IS ONE THAT GIVES OUR CONSTITUENTS PRIVATE INFORMATION OVER A TO A THIRD PARTY. NOT TO PROTECT THEM BUT TO ALLOW THE THIRD PARTY TO I'M HAVE SPECIAL ACCESS SPECIAL PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT WITH THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION. IN ORDER TO UNIONIZE AND WE DON'T DO THAT FOR ANYTHING ELSE. AND THERE ARE MANY PROVISIONS THAT WE HAVE VOTED ON RECENTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS THAT ARE NOT FORCED UPON EMPLOYEES IN THE NAME OF HELPING THEM. YET WITH THIS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GIVING AWAY THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION. AND I BELIEVE AND I THINK WE ALL SHOULD AGREE THAT THE GOVERNMENT. SHOULD HOLD ON TO THAT PRIVATE INFORMATION AND NOT GIVE IT OUT. UNLESS THERE IS A VERY NARROW MOST PUBLIC HEALTH OR PUBLIC SAFETY REASON AND IT'S LEGITIMATE. AND FAVORING ONE PARTICULAR USE I AND MAKING. OUR EMPLOYEES THE THE HEALTH CARE AIDES HAVE TO OPT OUT IS NOT A LEGITIMATE REASON IN ADDITION THE PROVISIONS OF OPT OUT THAT ARE IN THIS BILL ARE VAGUE. LOTS OF OTHER LEGISLATION THAT WE'VE SEEN BEFORE IS THAT OPT OUT PROVISIONS THIS LACKS ANY OF THOSE SPECIFICATIONS FOR HOW THE OPT OUT HOUSE TO HAPPEN IN BY NGUYEN. AND FINALLY YES THE GOVERNOR DID VETO IT VERY SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR WAS GLAD THAT HE DID THAT. AND WHILE THIS MAKES THE REVIEW THIS MAKES IT APPLY TO PROSPECT OF EMPLOYEES IT'S ALSO FOR ANY WHO ARE GOING TO BE RENEWING THEIR LICENSE SO IT STILL COVERS ALL THE SAME EMPLOYEES EVENTUALLY. THE LAST YEAR'S VETO BILL COVERED WE SHOULD BE MUCH MORE RESPECTFUL OF THE PRIVATE INFORMATION OF THESE HOMEMADE WORKERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THE FIRST ONE BEING WE'VE WHICH IS THE ORGANIZATION THAT IS WORKING. WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE WITH RESPECT TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN A SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS IN ADDITION CRIME SURVIVORS RESOURCE CENTER ALLIANCE SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES OPPOSED TO A CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ORGANIZATION. THERE'S A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS AND. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WHILE THIS BILL. I BELIEVE ALLOWS FOR A MEMBER TO OPT OUT. REALLY IT SHOULD BE A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TO OPT IN. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. AID DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM WHO IS STILL IN THE HOME WITH HER ABUSER. AND THEN SHE STARTS GETTING PHONE CALLS FROM PEOPLE FROM THIS ORGANIZATION BECAUSE HER NAME IS ON THE LIST AND SHE FORGOT TO OPT OUT YEAR DON'T YOU THAT CAUSES HER GREAT HARM YOU PUT HER IN A VERY. DANGEROUS SITUATION TO TRY TO EXPLAIN HER ABUSER NO I DIDN'T GIVE THAT MAN MY PHONE NUMBER I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GOT MY PHONE NUMBER. THIS IS THIS IS NOT GOOD POLICY. AT THE VERY LEAST. IT SHOULD BE THAT THEY HAVE TO OPTED NOT OPT OUT SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT ALL OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE. MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY FIVE PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN FOR THIS WOMEN BASED WORKFORCE. HOME CARE AIDES ARE MAJORITY. OF WHOM ARE WOMEN WORK LONG HOURS IN ISOLATED SETTINGS AND THEY'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY REALLY CAN'T FIND OUT ABOUT THE RIGHTS. THEY CAN'T FIND OUT ABOUT ADEQUATE TRAINING AND SUPPORT REPRESENTATION HOME CARE AIDES CAN REALIZE OUR RIGHTS EXPRESS THEIR FULL POTENTIAL TO CARE FOR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHEN THEY HAVE ACCESS TO PEOPLE WHO CAN REPRESENT THEM. THIS IS VERY CLEAR EVERY PERSON AND I I THINK IT'S ALMOST OFFENSIVE TO SUGGEST THAT A WORKER CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO MARK THE OPT OUT PROVISION IF THEY ARE IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION. WHILE I RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THAT SOME PEOPLE DO NOT WANT THEIR PHONE NUMBER IN NAME GIVEN TO A UNION. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DO IN FACT A BASS MAJORITY OF OUR HOME HEALTH CARE WORKERS THIS IS NOT PERSPECTIVE NOBODY AUTOMATICALLY GETS PUT ON THE REGISTRY. ANYTIME BEFORE THERE'D THEIR NAME AND THEIR PHONE NUMBER IS GIVEN OUT THEY'LL HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT I'M SORRY BUT THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO ENSURE. THAT OUR HOME HEALTHCARE WORKERS CAN UNDERSTAND AND FULLY UTILIZE THEIR RIGHTS AT WORK WHICH ARE VERY ISOLATED WORKPLACE WITHOUT THIS PROVISION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. MISTER SANTIAGO YOUR RECOGNIZE. I WOULDN'T WANT TO REPEAT WHAT MY COLLEAGUES SIDE. I AND I RISE IN SUPPORT. BUT I WANT TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR. THIS BILL HAS HAS. HAS GOTTEN OUT OF THIS HOUSE FOR THE MOST CLOSE TO FIFTY VOTES. AND THIS IS THE MORE WATERED DOWN VERSION OF IT. SIMPLY ONLY ALLOWS FOR THE NAME. AND TELEPHONE NUMBER AN EMPLOYEE CAN OPT OUT AND LET'S BE VERY VERY CLEAR IF THERE ARE FILLING THIS OUT AT WORK. THEY ARE GOING TO BE REMINDED PLENTY OF TIMES BY THEIR EMPLOYER TO OPT OUT. AND IN FACT I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THEY'D BE CAMPAIGN FROM THE EMPLOYER. TO REQUEST AN EMPLOYED OPT OUT SO THAT SHOULD BE A CONCERN. BEGIN WITH. IT'S I RESPECTFULLY WOULD ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL THE PROVISIONS IN THERE FOR A FOR SAFETY ARE INCLUDED MEANING A PERSON CAN OPT OUT. AND IT'S A MUCH SIMPLER BILL THAT WOULD SEEK TO ADDRESS THE VETO MESSAGE THANK YOU. SAY NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION DEBATE MISTER KALRA YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR RISING IN SUPPORT. AS INDICATED THIS IS A MORE NARROW VERSION THAT THAT. PASSED LAST YEAR AND AGAIN THE PRIMARY CONCERN RAISED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS THE PROSPECT VERSE RETROACTIVE NATURE THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSES SO ANYONE THAT'S CURRENTLY ON THE REGISTRY WILL NOT.

I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WHO HAVE SHARED CONCERN AND HAVE SET UP A MEETING FOR NEXT WEEK IF THIS BILL IS ABLE TO GET OFF THE FLOOR HERE TODAY. AB TWENTY SIX FORTY NINE HAS TWO PARTS. THE FIRST PART CODIFIES INTO LAW WOULD GOVERNOR BROWN INCLUDED IN THE EXECUTIVE IN HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER. DURING THE WORST OF THE DROUGHT. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER CREATED A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY TEMPORARY WATER. RIGHT PERMITS. IT DIRECTS THE STATE WATER BOARD TO PRIORITIZE TEMPORARY WATER RIGHT PERMITS FOR PROJECTS THAT ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF LOCAL OR STATE AGENCIES. TO CAPTURE HIGH RUNOFF FOR GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. THE GOAL OF THESE PERMITS IS TO CAPTURE HIGH PRECIPITATION EVENTS AND TO STORE WATER UNDERGROUND THAT WOULD OTHERWISE FLOW OUT INTO THE OCEAN. UNDER TWENTY SIX FORTY NINE THE DIVERSION OF WATER. FOR GROUNDWATER RECHARGE WOULD BE CONSIDERED A BENEFICIAL USE. WE WILL NEED EVERY TOOL IN ORDER FOR CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS. BECOME COMPLIANCE TO THE UPCOMING IMPLEMENTATION DEADLINES.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS IS ANOTHER MEASURE THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THIS YEAR DEALING WITH THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. AND THE GOAL OF THIS MEASURE IS SIMPLE TO GET MORE DOCTORS AND PHYSICIANS ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO TREAT THOSE ADDICTED. TWO OPIOIDS WITH A MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT KNOWING IT THIS IS REALLY WHAT'S OUT WORKING OUT THERE TO GET PEOPLE TO TO. TO GET RID OF THEIR ADDICTION HOW THIS WOULD HAVE POSITIONS INSURGENTS COMPLETE. ONE OUR OF ONE TIME CONTINUE EDUCATION A COURSE ON THE TREATMENT OF OPIOID DID THAT DEPENDENT. PATTON SPECIFICALLY ON ABOUT OPTIONS RELATE TO MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT THE REALITIES IF YOU GO TO AN E. ARE TODAY WITH A BROKEN FOOT. YOU CAN WALK OUT WITH THE PRESCRIPTION FILLED WITH PAIN KILLERS THE FEATHER INDIVIDUAL GOES ANY ARE ITS ADDICTED. TO HEROIN OR OPIOIDS THINK IT'S THE SAME DOCTOR IN THOSE DOCTORS DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TREAT THAT PERSON WITH MEDICALLY ASSISTED. TREATMENTS AND SO THIS WOULD ENABLE OUR ONE HOUR COURSE FOR PEOPLE ON THE CONTINUING EDUCATION TO BRIEF THEM. AND GET THEM ENGAGED IN OPTIONS. OTHER THAN PROVIDING A PAIN KILLERS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THIS TRAINING WOULD COUNT TOWARDS THE REQUIRED FIFTY HOURS. OF CONTINUED EDUCATION FOR PHYSICIANS DO WANT TO NOTE THAT AFTER THE LAST COMMITTEE HEARING WE WORKED WITH SOME OF THE OPPOSITION BY A CALM TO REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION'S. EVER CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE CMA ANOTHER POSITION GROUPS AND IDEAS TO FURTHER IMPROVE THIS MEASURE AS IT GOES ALONG TO THE SENATE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

DESPITE THE INCREASING SUCCESS OF MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENTS FOR OPIOID ABUSE LESS THAN TWO PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL PROVIDERS ARE CERTIFIED. TO PRESCRIBE THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ACCESS THE BEST WAY TO INCREASE ACCESS IS TO GET MORE PROVIDER CERTIFIED SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY TREAT THIS EPIDEMIC AND HELP OUR FOLKS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS. WHERE? MATH IS ONE OF THE BEST USE DUH REMEDIES FOR FIGHTING THE EPIDEMIC. AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY SEVEN WILL HELP WITH THIS LACK OF ACCESS BY REQUIRING DOCTORS TO BECOME CERTIFIED.

THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK ON THESE PROJECTS RECEIVE PREVAILING WAGE AND ALLOW THEM TO BENEFIT FROM A PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS. CONDUIT REVENUE BOND IS FINANCING COORDINATED BY A PUBLIC ENTITY SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FINANCING AUTHORITY UNDER THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. THE STATE LOSES REVENUE ON THES BONDS AS INVESTORS DO NOT PAY TAXES INTERNED THE BORROWER BENEFITS BY RECEIVING LOWER INTEREST. UNDER EXISTING LAW CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITIES THAT ARE FUNDED BY STATE BONDS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY. WITH SURVEILLING WAGE AND. HIGHER CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS UNDER THE FIELD ACT. PROJECTS THAT ARE FUNDED WITH CONDUIT. UP BONDS HOWEVER DO NOT. WE MUST ENSURE THAT THOSE WORKING ON THE STATE'S SUBSIDIZE DOT PROJECTS ARE SKILLED AND QUALIFIED. IS A POLICY THAT KEEPS GIVING. APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS MIDDLE CLASS JOBS WHICH HAS A PROVEN PROVEN IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY. THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER A SIMILAR BILL THE LEGISLATURE PASSED JUST A FEW YEARS AGO.

TO HAVE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS BE SUBJECT FAILING WEIGHT REQUIREMENTS FUNDING FOR TEACHERS LEARNING MATERIALS AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS WILL BE REDUCED BECAUSE IT IS AS VIEW. BECAUSE IT IS A ZERO SUM GAME. A CONDUIT BONDS AT THE CHARTER SCHOOLS USE TO FINANCE PROJECTS ARE NOT PUBLICLY FINANCED AND SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS. STATE COSTS FOR ADMINISTERING A PROCESSING THESE BONDS ARE INCLUDED IN THE COST OF THE BORROWER IN THE STATE IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DEFAULT.

THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE MANY WATER PIPES FAUCETS FIXTURES. STILL IN USE CONTAIN LEAD IN OVERTIME THIS LEAD CAN LEACH INTO THE DRINKING WATER. YET WE KNOW YOUNG CHILDREN ARE THE MOST HARMED BY LEAD BECAUSE THEY ABSORB MUCH OF THE LEAD THEY INGEST. ACCORDING TO AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS AND THE CENTERS OF FOR DISEASE CONTROL THERE IS NO SAFE LEAD. LEVEL OF LEAD. FOR CHILDREN. LET IS SEVERE NEUROTOXIN EVEN MINUTE AMOUNTS OF LEAD IN THE BODIES OF VERY YOUNG CHILDREN CAUSE HARM TO THEIR CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. AND THIS HARM APPEARS TO BE IRREVERSIBLE. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY WILL HELP YOU KEEP OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN SAVED BY ENSURING THEY ARE NOT IN JUST A LEAD THROUGH THE WATER THEY DRINK. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION IN BIPARTISAN SUPPORT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU ABOUT. THANK YOU MISS HOLDEN SEEING NO DISCUSSION DEBATE. CARP LOCAL ROLL-ON MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. KIRK WELL CLOSE ROLL TIDE ABOUT. I SIXTY FIVE. KNOWS ONE. THAT MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO STAY WITH MISTER HOLDEN. WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO FILE ITEM EIGHTY TWO. AB THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX. AGAIN MISTER HOLDEN. CORKERY. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX BY SELLING MEMBER HOLDEN AND ACTUALLY THE OIL AND GAS NATURALLY YOU MAKE IT ALL BUT. I THINK YOU CAN MISTER SPEAKER. ARE MUCH LIKE ACTIVE PRODUCTION SITES IDLE AND ABANDONED OIL AND GAS WELLS CAN LEAK POLLUTION INTO OUR MOST NECESSARY RESOURCES LIKE AIR AND WATER. AB THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX FOCUSES ON THE AIR POLLUTION IMPACTS FROM LEAKING IDLE AND ABANDONED WELLS. THIS BILL CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND WILL AID IN IMPROVING THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES BY ACCUMULATING DATA. ON AIR POLLUTION. I DON'T ABANDONED WELLS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE PRESENTED PROBLEMS FOR COMMUNITY EXPOSURE IN THE RECENT PAST. AND THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN REPORT BY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. LOOKING AT LA COUNTY IS ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY ACTIVE INACTIVE WELLS FOUND THAT ORPHAN WELLS. ARE OFTEN IMPROPERLY ABANDONED OR LEFT IDLE. WHICH MAY RESULT IN COMMUNITIES BEEN IMPACTED BY HYDROGEN SULFIDE AND PETROLEUM ODORS THESE CHEMICALS CAN CAUSE HEADACHES NOSEBLEEDS AND NAUSEA. AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO ABANDONED WELLS IN ECHO PARK NEAR LOS ANGELES WERE FOUND LEAKING COMPOUNDS IN A DENSELY POPULATED DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. FORCING LIMPLY EXCAVATES. EVACUATION AND EXPOSURES. WHEN WE UNCOVER THE DATA OF THESE TWO ABANDONED WELLS IT WAS FOUND THAT THE GHASTLY LEVEL LEAKAGE LEVELS WERE ADDED NEAR. THE EXPLOSIVE LIMIT WHICH IS A VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION FOR THE HOMEOWNERS AND THE FIRST RESPONDERS WHO HAD NO IDEA THAT ONE OF THE WELLS WAS EVEN THERE. WHEN THESE WELLS LEAK INTO RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES THAT IS OFTEN TIMES THE STATE THAT BURNS THE COSTS OF RELOCATING INDIVIDUALS. CLEANING UP IN REPAIRING THE SIDE. THIS BILL CAN SAVE THE STATE MONEY BY HAVING THE DATA SOONER SO WE DID NOT REACH CRISIS LEVELS OF EMISSIONS. WE ALL REMEMBER LISA CANYON AND CONTINUE TO FEEL THE EFFECTS. WHO IS THE CANYON SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WELLS GET OLDER AND ART MAINTAIN? THEY LEAGUE. THEY LEAK AND PRESENT A HAZARD FOR COMMUNITIES AND FIRST RESPONDERS. OTHER STATES IN THE U. K. HAVE STUDIED THIS ISSUE AND FOUND THAT IDLE WELLS DO IN FACT LEAK. PENNSYLVANIA FOUND THAT I TO WELLS LEAK. ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR NEARLY THIRTY PERCENT OF THE STATE'S METHANE POLLUTION. WITH BETTER MONITORING IN BETTER DATA UPFRONT WE CAN AVOID THESE CRISIS IS IN THE FUTURE. THE OPPOSITION HAS BEEN ARGUING THAT THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE DUPLICATIVE. I WANNA BE EXTREMELY CLEAR ON THIS POINT. SOME OIL AND GAS WELLS ARE SUBJECT TO AIR EMISSION TESTING BY CAR. BUT THE VAST MAJORITY ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF AYE TO WELLS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THIS AIR TESTING. SPECIFICALLY THE CARD REGULATIONS DO NOT REQUIRE LEAKAGE TESTING ON ALL OIL WELLS. IMPORTANTLY EVEN IF TESTED. KNOW THE INFORMATION IS REQUIRED TO BE MADE PUBLIC. OUR BILL WILL MAKE AIR MISSION TESTING ON WELLS THAT ARE TO BE PLUGGED IT ABANDONED. WITHIN A QUARTER MILE. FROM HUMAN OCCUPANCY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. THERE ARE FEDERAL STANDARDS ON LARGE OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS TO REPORT THEIR MISSION ON A YEARLY BASIS. HOWEVER THESE FACILITIES REPORT. BASED ON ESTIMATES USING STANDARD EMISSION FACTORS. AB SIX SEVENTEEN REQUIRES CARP TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITIES OVER BURDENED BY AIR POLLUTION AN ESTABLISHED COMMUNITY AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PLANS. BUT WITH ONLY WHAT WOULD ONLY BE IMPLEMENTED IN A FEW SELECT COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE AND DOESN'T PROVIDE DATA ON WHETHER I DON'T WELLS OUTSIDE OF THESE COMMUNITIES. ARE LEAKING. FURTHERMORE IF YOU ARE DOING TESTING UNDER AB SIX SEVENTEEN THAT WOULD QUALIFY IN EXEMPTS YOU FROM THE TESTING UNDER OUR CURRENT BILL. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL FROM WELLS WITHIN A HALF MILE OF HUMAN OCCUPANCY TO ONLY WELLS THAT ARE TO BE PLUGGED IN ABANDONED WITHIN A QUARTER MILE. FROM HUMAN OCCUPANCY. WE HAVE ADDED A SUNSET DATE OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY SIX SO THIS ISA SHORT PROGRAM TO COLLECT EMISSIONS DATA THAT COULD BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. TO BETTER INFORM POLICY MOVING FORWARD. RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL ENSURE THAT OIL AND GAS OPERATORS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO DUPLICATIVE TESTING REQUIREMENTS. IN FACT THE BILL EXPLICITLY STATES THAT AN OPERATOR WHO HAS CONDUCTED TESTING ON A WELL PURSUANT TO FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THREE MONTHS. DOES NOT HAVE TO PERFORM THAT TESTING AGAIN THIRTY SECONDS OF HIS ROLE THAT I'M HAPPY TO COMMIT TO AMENDING THE BILL IN THE SENATE. TO STATE THAT AN OPERATOR WHO HAS CONDUCTED TESTING ON WELLS DOES NOT HAVE TO PERFORM THE TEST AGAIN. I WOULD SIMPLY STRIKE THE THREE MONTH CURRENTLY IN SECTION TO. THE WELL OPERATORS WILL STILL HAVE TO REPORT THE DATA THEY ARE COLLECTING THROUGH THE EMISSION TEST AND MAKE IT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. IDA WELLS ARE ONLY IN RURAL AREAS THERE IN URBAN AND SUBURBAN AREAS THEIR NEXT DOOR PARKS UNDER OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR BACKYARDS IN NEAR WHERE WE WORK. STUDIES FROM OTHER STATES HAVE SHOWN IDA WELLS LEAGUE WITH THIRTY THOUSAND IDA WELLS IN CALIFORNIA THIS TIME WE KNOW. THE HEALTH IMPACTS THEY ARE CAUSING OUR FRIENDS OUR FAMILIES WHO LIVE NEAR THESE WELLS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I THINK IT WAS HOLDEN MISTER MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO. THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM PASADENA FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT BILL THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BILL. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE BETTER UNDERSTANDS THE IMPACTS OF UNPLUGGED EIDOLON ABANDONED WELLS AND THE IMPACT THEY HAVE ON OUR COMMUNITIES. AND OUR WORKERS SAFETY WE ALL HAVE A MANY OF THESE UNPLUG I DON'T ABANDONED WELLS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING. OUR COMMUNITIES SO I URGE. MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. MS KAMLAGER-DOVE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX BECAUSE OF THE AIR EMISSIONS IMPACTS FROM IDLE OIL WELLS IN MY DISTRICT. IN FACT THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT THAT I HAVE ASKED THE AUTHOR TO ADD ME AS A PRINCIPAL CHO AUTHOR WHEN THE BILL AS AMENDED IN THE SENATE. THE INGLEWOOD OIL FIELD IS PERHAPS THE LARGEST AND MOST DENSELY CONNECTED URBAN OILFIELD IN THE NATION AND AS I STATED IT RESIDES IN THE FIFTY FOURTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. THE OIL FIELD AND ITS WELLS ARE LOCATED NEAR HOMES CHILD CARE CENTERS AND OUTSIDE PLAYGROUNDS USED BY MY CONSTITUENTS. AND SOME OF THOSE WELLS ARE LEAKING DUE TO THEIR AGE. I THINK MOST FOLKS START LEAKING BASED ON THEIR AGE. PEOPLE HEREBY SUFFER. I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE FOLKS ARE LISTENING THIS IS IMPORTANT. PEOPLE IN CLEARLY SUFFER AND COMPLAIN OF THE FOOT. MOVING SYMPTOMS PRIOR THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. WITH SYMPTOMS SUCH AS HEADACHES NAUSEA VOMITING AYE NOSE AND THROAT IRRITATION IN ADDITION TO TROUBLE BREATHING. AT PRESENT THE OILFIELD HAS ONLY TWO MONITORS THE INGLEWOOD OIL FIELD HAS ONLY TO WHO MONITORS WHICH IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE OIL. FIELD IS NEARLY ONE THOUSAND ACRES. AB THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE REPORTING AND DATA COLLECTION TO MAKE AIR EMISSIONS FROM IDLE AND ABANDONED OIL WELLS PUBLIC. IT ALSO APPLIES TO WELLS THAT WILL BE PERMANENTLY CLOSED. I WANT TO STRESS ALONG WITH THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL THAT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL ARE NOT WHOLLY DUPLICATIVE. WHILE SOME WELLS ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO AIR EMISSIONS TESTING BY CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. BUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEM ARE NOT. IF SIGNED INTO LAW THIS BILL SAYS THAT IF A WELL HAS BEEN TESTED IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS AN UNDERCURRENT HAY ARE THE RULES OIL COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE TO RETEST THE WELLS THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO RETEST THE WELLS. KEY PART OF THIS LEGISLATION CALLS FOR THE PUBLICLY POSTING TESTING RESULTS AND REPORTS. TODAY'S CONSUMERS INCLUDING US HAVE GOTTEN USED TO POSTING. CALORIE COUNTS INGREDIENTS AND NUTRITIONAL VALUES FOR OUR FOOD WE CERTAINLY BEEN LIKE IN THE BEGINNING BUT WE HAVE BECOME USED TO IT AND NOW WE WANT ALL THE TIME. SHOULDN'T THEY ALSO GET POSTINGS ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE AIR THAT WE BREATHE. IT IS TRUE THAT NOT ALL EMISSIONS ARE CAUSED BY OIL FIELDS BUT AS WE CONTINUE TO TACKLE THE ISSUES OF POLLUTION TOXICITY AND CLIMATE CLEANLINESS IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT IS IN THE AIR. AND WHERE IT COMES FROM I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX. THANK YOU MISS COME LATER THOUGH.

I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY ONE A BILL THAT HELPS THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD A ARE A ARE BE. IN THE FIGHT AGAINST VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED TO INVADE CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN AIR LAWS. NEW MOTOR VEHICLES ARE SUBJECT TO EMISSION TEST BY THE AIR BE TO VERIFY COMPLIANCE WITH CALIFORNIA MISSION LAWS HOWEVER DIVISIVE DEVICES EXIST THAT CAN ENABLE A VEHICLE TO FULL. EMISSION TESTING IN A PROMINENT EXAMPLE IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT VOLKSWAGEN HAD INSTALLED THE SO CALLED DEFEAT DEVICES AND MANY OF THEIR CARS. THESE DEVICES WERE DISCOVERED IN PART DUE TO REAL WORLD TESTING DATA THAT HELP DETECT THESE DEVICES. WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY UNDISCOVERED BOWL AND LABORATORY SETTINGS CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN CLEANING UP THE AIR IN FIGHTING AGAINST POLLUTANTS. BUT VW'S DECEPTIONS WAS PARTICULARLY DAMAGING BECAUSE MANY PARTS OF THE STATE STILL EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE NATION AND THESE DEVICES ALLOW THE EMISSIONS OF TOXIC POLLUTANTS. WHICH INTENSIFIES THIS PROBLEM AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY ONE. WOULD PARTNER WITH THEY ARE BE WITH ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH LABORATORIES AND EXPERTS IN ORDER TO ENHANCE.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE EIGHTY TWO BY SOME A MEMBER GIPSON AND EXPLAIN THE FIRE ARMS MAKING A PREPARATION THERE FOR. MISTER GIPSON. MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE EIGHTY TWO SIX TO CLOSE THE GHOST GUN LUPO BY REQUIRING STATE BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR PURCHASING OF GUN PARTS AND ALSO REATE A NEW LICENSE STRUCTURE FOR GUN PARTS DEALERS. NOT TOO LONG AGO. THERE WAS A SHOOTING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE A MAN MURDERED. FIVE PEOPLE INCLUDING HIS WIFE. WITH THE GHOST GUN. THIS MAN WHO WAS PROHIBITED FROM PURCHASING A FIREARM. SO HE TOOK TO THE INTERNET TO BUY GUN PARTS TO BUILD HIS OWN. THIS WAS ALSO THE CASE IN SANTA MONICA AND TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. WHERE A MAN ATTEMPTED TO PURCHASE A FIREARM BUT WAS NOT ALLOWED AFTER CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOUND HIM IN ELIGIBLE? HE THEN RESORTED TO BUILDING HIS OWN GUN. WHICH THEN HE USED TO KILL FIVE PEOPLE AND INJURE. SEVERAL OTHERS. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR BOTH GUN SALES AND AMMUNITION. YET SILENCE ON THE TREATMENT OF FAR OR PRECURSOR. THIS BILL INTENSE TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY BY PREVENTING CRIMINALS AND THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT OTHERWISE POSSESS A FIRE ARM. FROM GAINING ACCESS WHILE PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF GUN OWNERS. MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. JUST TWO MONTHS AGO A MAN WAS ARRESTED IN MY DISTRICT. AGE THIRTY SEVEN WHO PLED GUILTY. HE WAS MATTER FACTORING AND MAKING A QUE FIFTEENTH AT A ARE FORTY SEVENS IN MY DISTRICT. MY UNDERSTANDING THROUGH ARTICLE HE AND HIS WIFE WAS BOTH APPREHENDED ARRESTED AND PLED GUILTY FOR MAKING THESE GUNS. MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE EIGHTY TWO. THANK YOU MISS GIPSON MISTER HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY. THE LACK OF A DEFINITION FOR FIRE ARM PRECURSOR PARTS WILL BE CONFUSING FOR THE PUBLIC AS TO WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT COVERED BY THE BILL'S CRIMINAL PENALTIES. ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE IS ALREADY BEHIND WHEN IT COMES TO TRACKING DOWN THE MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BELIEVED AND ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF FIREARMS. CURRENTLY WILL TAKE MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE JUST TO CLEAR UP THAT EXISTING BACKLOG. WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE TO FOCUS ON KEEPING FIREARMS AWAY FROM THOSE ARE BELIEVED ILLEGAL POSSESSION. OF THEM RATHER THAN DIVERT THEIR ATTENTION TO THE TRANSACTION. OR THE TRANSACTIONS OF PRECURSOR PARTS. MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THIS BILL IS INCOMPLETE AND I BELIEVE NOT READY FOR PRIMETIME I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. MISTER BONTA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES SOMEONE OUT THANK. OUR COLLEAGUE FOR BRINGING FORWARD AT THIS BILL TO CLOSE THE GHOST GUN LOOPHOLE OUR. GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY REQUIRES CONTINUED BOLD ACTION IN CALIFORNIA'S ONGOING LEADERSHIP THE GHOST GUN LOOPHOLE. HAS SERVED AS AN END RUN AROUND CALIFORNIA'S REQUIRED. BACKGROUND CHECKS THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE TO HELP ADDRESS THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THEY WISH BONTA MS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND THE BACKGROUND CHECK TO PRECURSOR PARTS. THE INABILITY TO USE THE FEDERAL INSTANT BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM FOR AMMUNITION HAS ALREADY LED TO AN AMMUNITION BACKGROUND CHECK. BEING ABANDONED IN NEW YORK STATE NOW WE WANT TO ADD A A REQUIREMENT TO PRECURSOR PARTS TO SUFFERED THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER STATES BECAUSE THE CURRENT BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM COULD NOT BE USED. FOR FIREARM PARTS AND ACCESSORIES. THIS LICENSING A BACKGROUND CHECK LAW WILL IN TURN COST THE STATE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND IMPOSE MORE COSTS ON LAWFUL GUN OWNERS WHILE CRIMINALS WILL CONTINUE TO CIRCUMVENT THE LAW HIRED IN THE OVAL. MR MATHIS YOUR. YES QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. WITHOUT OBJECTION. YES HOW ARE YOU GONNA DETERMINE KNOW WHEN THE PART IS A PRE DATED IS A PRECURSOR OF NOT.

IN GOING AFTER THE PARTS IS NOT A WAY TO STOP A GHOST GUN LOOPHOLE ARENA THIS WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS GIVE. LAW ENFORCEMENT BETTER ABILITY TO GO AFTER BAD GUYS. THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THAT.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE PRESENT AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY THREE WHICH IS A VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD BILL. ADDRESSES SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL THE LAST A COUPLE OF DAYS ON THIS FLOOR THINGS LIKE OPIOID ADDICTION HOMELESSNESS MENTAL ILLNESS CRISIS. GUN GOT INVOLVED. SCHOOLS THE LIST GOES ON AND ON THERE IS A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN OUR COUNTRY IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WE MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. NOW SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW BECAUSE OF THE STATE AUDIT THAT THE STATE IS CURRENTLY COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY SITTING ON. TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ON EXPENDED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES MONIES. THIS IS A AT THIS IS I THINK I OUTRAGE IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WITH HOMELESSNESS. WITH A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WITH DEPRESSION WITH ANXIETY WITHIN TEMPERAMENT AMOUNT OF HOPE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. NICK COUNTY ALAMEDA A HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION DOLLARS UNSPENT IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY FORTY SIX MILLION FRESNO CA NINETY FIVE MILLION LOS ANGELES SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN MILLION ORANGE COUNTY. A QUARTER OF A BILLION DOLLARS NOT SPENT. ALL OF US HAVE TOWN HALL MEETINGS ALL OF US HAVE CONSTITUENTS ASK IS WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT THE OPIATE ADDICTION. QUESTION. MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LITERALLY AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THIS NEED AND YET COUNTIES ARE NOT SPENDING THIS MONEY THIS BILL IS RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD. COUNTIES ALREADY MUST SPIN THESE DOLLARS WITHIN THREE YEARS BUT AS YOU CAN TELL WITH THE TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ARE SEEN ON THEY ARE NOT DOING IT. THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS AFTER THREE YEARS OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES CITIES SCHOOL DISTRICTS. HOUSE MIDDLE DISTRICTS CAN APPLY FOR THESE FUNDS. BIG ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUR CITIES TO HELP UP PROVIDE HOMELESS OUTREACH TEAMS FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS FOR YOUR HOSPITALS TO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH BEDS IN THEIR EMERGENCY WARDS FOUR YEAR SCHOOLS TO HAVE MONIES FOR SCHOOL COUNSELORS TO TALK TO CHILDREN WHO ARE CRISIS. THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO FOR THE COUNTIES THAT A REFUSING TO SPEND THESE DOLLARS WERE SAYING TO THEM TIMES UP. WILL REALLOCATE BEAST MONIES TO COMMUNITIES THAT WILL USE THESE FUNDS MEMBERS IS A TWO THIRDS VOTE I RECOGNIZE THE COUNTIES ARE AGAINST IT BUT IF YOU CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY YOU'RE COUNTY HAS THESE ON EXPENDED DOLLARS PILING UP IN THEIR COFFERS. THEN I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE A MODEST REFORM THAT WILL MAKE I THINK AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IN THE MENTAL HEALTH OF MANY CALIFORNIANS. ARE THE CONSTITUENTS ARE PAINT THIS TAX NOW AND YET TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF IT IS GOING ON SPENT WE CAN DO BETTER OUR CONSTITUENTS NEED US YOU BETTER I ASK FOR YOUR AYE THOUGH. DOCTOR EGGMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THINK IT WAS SPEAKER I RIDE IN SUPPORT OF TWENTY EIGHT FORTY THREE IT'S QUITE TRUE. AND WHEN PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT HOMELESSNESS THEY ARE NOT GOING TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THEY'RE GOING TO THEIR CITY COUNCILS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND WE ARE OFTENTIMES HAPPENS BECAUSE A FORMER CITY COUNCIL MEMBER STUCK HOLDING THEIR BAG AND HAVE VERY. VIRTUALLY NO CONTROL OVER PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY THAT GOES TO THE COUNTIES HAVE ALSO BEEN A PART OF THOSE PLANNING COMMITTEES THAT GO ON FOR EVER AT THE COUNTY LEVEL TO THINK HOW WE'RE GONNA SPEND THAT MONEY. THIS MONEY WAS ALSO JUST TO DO PREVENTION WELL FRIENDS AWAY PASS PREVENTION NOW PREVENTION REALLY IMPORTANT BUT WE HAVEN'T INTERVENTION CRISIS ON OUR HANDS AND IF WE CAN'T FIND A WAY TO ACCESS THE MONEY THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SET ASIDE. WE HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE IN FRONT OF US SO WHAT IS STILL A LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS THIS CONVERSATION NEEDS TO CONTINUE ON SO WE CAN REALLY FIND A WAY TO GET THE MONEY THAT'S ALREADY THERE. GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS IN THE SERVICES THEY NEED INTO HOUSING GET OUR STREETS CLEAN GET OUR PEOPLE HEALTHY I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. MISTER COOLEY. COLLEAGUES ON PLEASE RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION HAD A RECOMMENDATION THIS AREA THAT THE. THERE BE A PUBLIC. PUBLICATION STATEWIDE OF COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN EXPENDED FUNDS I HAD THAT BILL THE GOVERNOR VETOED THAT BILL. IT WAS SIMPLY GOING TO PUT INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT THESE DOLLARS WHICH ARE DISCUSSING IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL. PUT OUT THERE IN THE PUBLIC REALM WHAT MONEY WAS AVAILABLE THAT BILL WENT TO THE GOVERNOR AS I SEE IT WAS A NUMBER ONE HOOVER COMMISSION. RECOMMENDATION HE VETOED IT. SO I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT EVOLUTION. IF IF WE CAN'T GET APPROVAL TO SIMPLY HAVE THE INFORMATION OUT THERE ON INTERNET WEBSITE. THEN I THINK CREIGHTON A SYSTEM SO THAT CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE CLOSE TO THE SCENE OF ISSUES UNDERSTAND THE LOCAL PROBLEMS SEE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM. SEE THE DOLLARS WHICH ARE NOT BEING EXPENDED THEIR DISTRICT SO THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR VOICE AND SAY. WE CAN DO THIS IN ONE OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES MONNOW INDIO. DEL NORTE THIS IS A BILL THAT WILL EMPOWER. PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO IDENTIFY LOCAL NEEDS AND BRING THAT FORWARD THIS IS NOT AS MUCH A BILL ABOUT RELEASING DOLLARS. AS A BILL ABOUT RELEASING ENERGY. ON PROBLEMS IN CRUISE UP AND DOWN THE STATE I THINK IS A FUNCTION OF US AS LAWMAKERS WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO RELEASE ENERGY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BILL HONORED TONIGHT VOTE. THEY WHICH COOLEY MISTER MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I JUST WANT TO ADD TO ALL THE BUILDING ANGER OVER THIS ISSUE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH RESERVES I CHAIR THE JOINT LESS AN AUDIT COMMITTEE AND WE HAD A. A HEARING JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND THERE WAS BIPARTISAN ANGER OVER TESTIMONY OVER SIXTY PERCENT AND RESERVE IS BEING HELD ON THESE MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS THAT NEED TO BE SPENT ON OUR STREETS. HELPING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE CHANGES AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THE WHISPERS YOU MISTER DALLI. YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I. REGRETFULLY HAVE TO STAND UP IN OPPOSITION FOR FOR SOMEBODY WHO SERVED. SIXTEEN YEARS ON THE BOARD OF AS THE PROBLEM IS NOT. THE FACT THAT. THEY'RE NOT SPENT THE MONEY WE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET THE SERVICES TO THE FOLKS ON MIL HELP YOU NEED TO. REMOVE THE BARRIERS THERE ARE HARD TO GET THIS MONEY OUT. THERE ARE THERE SO MANY REGULATIONS RULES ON THE PROP SIXTY THREE MONIES AND I WOULD SHARE WITH YOU THE CITIES. AND THE SPECIAL DISTRICT I WOULD. I'VE NEVER SEEN SPECIAL IS TO GIVE. THESE GUYS SERVICES BUT THE CITY WILL HAVE THE SAME BARRIERS THAT ARE THE COUNTIES ARE FACED WITH. AND SO I URGE YOU KNOW VOTERS WE GO BACK AND WE ACTUALLY REMOVE THAT REGULATED REGULATORY PROCESSES THAT ALLOW US TO GET THE SERVICES THESE FOLKS. MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT ADAM FROM MY COLLEAGUES TO THE FAR NORTH. AT. PERHAPS THAT WAS THE CASE IN YOUR COUNTY. BUT I'M I RISE IN SUPPORT OF OF THIS BILL BECAUSE WE WE HAPPEN TO LIVE IN A COUNTY. WHERE THERE'S JUST A REFUSAL TO SPEND THIS MONEY THAT THERE'S JUST NO POLITICAL WILL? TO SPEND THE MONEY ON THE SERVICES THAT ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT BY SOMEHOW HOARDING THIS MONEY THAT THEY'RE IN A BETTER FISCAL POSITION REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE DYING ON THE STREETS OF SAN DIEGO. WE HAVE OTHER ENTITIES WILLING TO PUT IN SERVICES TO DO THE HARD WORK TO ABIDE BY BY THE INITIATIVE AND ACTUALLY PROVIDE SERVICES SO WHEN YOU HAVE A A SUPERVISOR A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS LIKE WE HAVE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THERE IS NOTHING ELSE BUT DESPERATION THAT WE CAN. DO THAT TO PRESENT A BILL LIKE THIS I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR PAYING FOR THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. MS RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AYE I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF OF THE. ALLOWING THE MONEY TO COME OUT I SIT ON SOMEONE ELSE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUT ON SOMEONE WE HAD A LONG LONG. PAINFUL DISCUSSION WITH THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT RELEASING THE MONEY AND WHY THAT THE REASON THAT THEY HAD NOT SO I. WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE'RE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REGULATIONS ARE LEFT IT FROM THE STATE BECAUSE THAT WAS THE BIGGEST ARGUMENT. ABOUT ONE OF THE COMMENTS WAS THAT THE PROCESS IS VERY COMPLICATED AND ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT I MADE. WAS WHY THE PROCESS SO COMPLICATED AND THEY SAID I ASKED THEM WHO CREATES THE PROCESS AND THEY CREEK PROCESS MY QUESTION TO THEM IS OR MY COMMENT TO THEM WITH YOU CANNOT COMPLAIN ABOUT A PROCESS THAT YOU CREATE. AND SO THE ISSUES THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE BEING ADDRESSED THROUGH SOMEONE. THIS IS IN COORDINATION WITH THAT WE ARE WORKING VERY DID A VERY HARD. THE. CHAIR OF SOMEONE IS ONBOARD WITH THIS I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR HIM BUT. WHEN WE WERE IN COMMITTEE WE WERE TALKING TO THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT MAKING THOSE REGULATIONS LOOSER SO THAT THE COUNTIES CAN. ACCESS THAT MONEY AND THIS ISN'T GOING TO. DOCTOR ARAMBULA BUT. THE THIS BILL IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR EFFORTS IN SOMEONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MONEY IS RELEASED TO THE COUNTY SOLD TO ADDRESS YOUR ISSUE WE ARE WORKING REALLY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DEPARTMENTS ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE COUNTIES. AND THAT THAT MONEY IS RELEASED AND SO THIS BILL IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR REQUEST AND SOMEONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MONEY IS RELIEF. THANK YOU. MISS QUIRK SILVA. THANK YOU MEMBERS AND MISTER SPEAKER. I ACTUALLY RISE TO ASK US TO TAKE A PAUSE ON THIS AND ALTHOUGH I RESPECT MY COLLEAGUES. UP I WANT TO BE THE FIRST TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ORANGE COUNTY IS WITH THE COUNTY THAT REALLY HAS HAD THE MOST MONEY AND HAS SPENT THE LEAST. THIS IS A PROBLEM IT'S A PROBLEM THAT WAS MENTIONED THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHERE ARE THESE FUNDS HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE AND WHY HAVEN'T WE USE THOSE. AND WHEN I LOOKED OUT IT IT'S OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS SERIOUS WHEN WE'VE HAD A WHAT HAS BEEN FRONT PAGE NEWS ACROSS THE COUNTRY REALLY. OUGHT WITH TWO TO THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE LIVING IN ANA RIVER BED. WE HAD A FEDERAL JUDGE COME MEN AND DEMAND THAT WE START TO USE THESE FUNDS. BUT. BECAUSE OF AS WAS SAID SOME UNWILLING NO SOMETIMES A. BARRIERS MULTIPLE REASONS THOSE FUNDS HAVE NOT BEEN USED SO I COULD EASILY STAND UP HERE AND SAY WILL TAKE THAT MONEY USE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE OF SOMEBODY ELSE CAN USE THAT. KIND OF THE USE IT OR LOSE IT THEME AND AS AN EDUCATOR I'VE SEEN THAT AND MARK OUR PROFESSION MANY TIMES. BUT MY. REQUEST IS WE KNOW THERE'S HOUSING ISSUES WE KNOW THERE'S MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE KNOW THERE ARE LOCAL ISSUES AND BY SAYING IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE THAT LET'S SWEEP IT UP SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT MAKES. I IT EVEN MORE OF A PROBLEM SO I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE WE JUST HAD AN AUDIT WE KNOW THE MONEY IS THERE AND SO I SAY LET'S GO BACK TO OUR COUNTIES. LET'S MAKE SURE THEY'RE CLEAR AND GIVE THEM ANOTHER ADDITIONAL TIME TO USE THAT MONEY AND THEN BY ALL MEANS. TAKE IT IF THERE BUT LET THAT KNOW THE CLARITY OF WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE AND I WILL BE THE FIRST TO TALK TO MY COUNTY. BUT BY TONIGHT JUST SAYING LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT TO ANOTHER COUNTY WE ARE GOING TO THEN BE MAKING. PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE PARTICULARLY IN ORANGE COUNTY EVEN WORSE SO I WILL BE ON THE PHONE TONIGHT WITH OUR SUPERVISORS BUT I ASK FOR A NO VOTE TONIGHT. MISTER FRAZIER THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES. I HAPPEN TO SERVE ON THE MENTAL HEALTH CAUCUS HERE IN THE CAPITAL WAS SENATOR JIM BELL. AND IN THESE MEETINGS THAT WE'VE HAD WE'VE HAD REPORTS BY. THE AUDIT COMMITTEES AND AND AND MESA GOING FORWARD TELLING US HOW INEFFECTIVE THE PROCESS HAS BEEN. I WANT BECAUSE OF THESE REPORTS I'VE GONE OUT IN MY DISTRICT AND TOURED MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES NOW YOU REMEMBER THERE WAS A DIMINISHMENT. OF MENTAL HEALTH HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA. AND DUE TO THAT WAS THE THE REASON FOR PROP SIXTY THREE. SO NOW IN MY MY DISTRICT WE DON'T HAVE PEDIATRIC. OF. OF CRISIS BEDS. WE DON'T HAVE PEDIATRIC ANYTHING BUT WE HAVE TWENTY THREE BEDS FOUR OF A COUNTY OF IF YOU KNOW HUNDRED. OR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE YOU THINK ABOUT. WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO BE ABLE TO DO TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK? THERE'S NOTHING MOVING FORWARD. YOU GO TO CRISIS YOU GET TWENTY THREE HOURS IF IF THEN YOU'RE BUMPED OUT OF CRISIS THEN YOU GO TO THE THE HOSPITAL FOR. FOR POSSIBLY SEVENTY TWO ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY THEN AFTER THAT YOU END UP IN COUNTY JAIL. WE DON'T HAVE CAPACITY. WHAT WE OUR IS HURTING THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HELP? SITTING ON THIS MONEY WAITING ANOTHER YEAR. BY HOLDING OFF IS GONNA DO NOBODY ANY HARM WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MOVE THIS BILL OUT. AND WORK ON IT SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE. TO HELP THE PEOPLE THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA VOTED FOR PROP SIXTY THREE. TO HELP THIS PROBLEM. I ABSOLUTELY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THINGS FRAZIER. SHE BROKE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I FEEL COMPELLED TO FOLLOW UP ON A FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM FULLER TIN. SHACKS WHO REALLY HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. IN ORANGE COUNTY HOW WE HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. TO ADDRESS THIS AND I COME AT THIS FROM SERVING AT THE VA WHERE BACK IN THE TWO THOUSANDS TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF HOMELESS FOR VETERANS. WELL I ALSO STARTED A HOMELESS TASK FORCE ON THE DANA POINT CITY COUNCIL BUT I REALIZE THE GOVERNMENT WASN'T THE ANSWER SO ON THAT. TASK FORCE WE PUT ORGANIZATIONS TO DO THIS FOR A LIVING WE HAVE FAMILY ASSISTANCE MINISTRIES A CATHOLIC CHURCH THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE PUT ALL THESE GROUPS ON. AND WHAT THE COUNTY NEEDS TO DO IS THEY NEED TO OUR OF P. THE MONEY OUT TO THESE GROUPS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. THE COUNTY CANNOT MANAGE THIS ON THEIR OWN. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM FULLER TO MENTION A JUDGE HAD TO STEP IN FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE TO EVEN DO ANYTHING. THE FIRST ACTION WAS TO CLEAR ATTEND CITY BY ANGEL STADIUM. THIS IS MORE THAN JUST HOMELESSNESS THEY FOUND DRUG ADDICTS THEY FOUND TEN THOUSAND NEEDLES THEY FOUND A CRIME SYNDICATE THEY FOUND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF STOLEN BICYCLES. THEY FOUND SEX RINGS IN THESE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS SO. AGAIN I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM FULLER TEN THAT WE NEED TO HOUND ON THE COUNTY SUPERVISORS TO COME UP WITH A PLAN LOCALLY. AND GET THAT MONEY OUT TO THE PROFESSIONALS THE DO THIS FOR A LIVING I ASK FOR NO VOTE ON THIS AND LET'S GO BACK TO OUR COUNTIES AND URGED HIM TO DEVELOP A PLAN. TO GET THE HELP TO THE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS. I. THINK MR PEROT. DOCTOR WEBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY THREE. YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED A LOT IN THIS HOUSE ABOUT OUR NEEDS I'VE HEARD MANY OF YOU GET UP WELL JUST A FEW SECONDS AGO AND TALK ABOUT THE GROWING OPIUM. KIND OF ADDICTION PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE HAVING IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND SOME OF THE US TALK EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THE HOMELESS AND ON AND ON AND ON. AND YET ARE COUNTIES ARE THAT REALLY THE ARM OF THE STATE WHOSE TASK IS TO BASICALLY IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE. IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT THEN WE BECOME INEFFECTIVE EVEN IN OUR ABILITY TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. AND I'M SURE MOST OF YOU HEARD FROM YOUR MEMBERS OF THESE I HEAR FROM CONSTITUENTS WHY DON'T WE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHY DON'T WE HAVE ME MONEY FOR MENTAL HEALTH WHY DON'T WE HAVE COUNSELING PROGRAMS OF ALL THESE THINGS. AND I'M SAYING TO THEM WELL WE FUNDED IT WE GAVE IT TO THE COUNTY WE DID THIS DO THAT AND I COUNTY HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING WITH IT. THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE MONEY THAT'S THERE IN TERMS OF US AS THE AGENCY THAT GAVE THEM THE MONEY TO DO THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. AND SO IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT THEN WHO THE HECK ARE WE. I MEAN WE'RE GIVING MONEY AND WOULD NOT A DEMANDING THAT THEY USE IT I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE COUNTY FOLKS ABED STUPID THAT THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE MONEY THAT THEY GET THAT WE'VE GIVEN THEM. SOME OF YOU GIVEN GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS PARTNER WOULD NONPROFITS ALL THOSE THINGS ARE ELIGIBLE THE A THAT THEY CAN DO. THEY CHOOSE NOT TO AND THAT'S ONE OF THINGS WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT'S NOT THAT THE LACK OF INFORMATION MOST OF OUR COUNTIES HAVE STAFF HAVE PEOPLE WHOSE JOBS ARE TO RUN THE COUNTY. TO DEAL WITH IT THE VARIOUS ISSUES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE RESOURCES IS THERE AND IF THEY GET YOU GOING TO GIVE THEM A COUPLE YEARS THIS EXPENDABLE AND THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. THAN SOMEONE ELSE TO TAKE THE RESOURCES THEY'RE NOT THERE TO BANK THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE HAS PUT IN PLACE FOR THEM TO DO WITH THE DOLLARS THAT WE'VE GIVEN THEM. SO I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I KNOW ABOUT MINE AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT THAT ARE NOT MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE IN THOSE IN THOSE COUNTIES. AND THEY AND THAT THE BECAUSE THE COUNTIES ARE SO LARGE IN THE CONSTITUENCY GROUPS ARE SO HUGE THEY CAN PRETTY MUCH HIDE AND NOT SPENDING MONEY. SO I REALLY THINK THAT IS NOW TIME THAT WE THE FISH OR CUT BAIT YOU GOTTA DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO AND THEY KNOW BECAUSE MOST OF YOU HAVE COMPLAIN TO THEM. YOUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE COMPLAINED THAT WOULD NOT GETTING THE SERVICES THAT WE NEED AND WHEN WE SIT AROUND AND TALK ABOUT THE GROWING HOMELESS PROP POPULATE PROBLEM WE TALK ABOUT THE DRUG ADDICTION PROBLEM WE TALK ABOUT THE BASICALLY THE RACIAL ISSUES IN COUNTIES AND ON AND ON AND ON. IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THEN WE NEED TO LET SOMEONE THE SCHOOLS OR THE CITY OR SOMEONE ELSE THAT AREA HANDLE IT. I GUARANTEE YOU IF THIS PASSES THEY WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THEY WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE MONEY THEY'RE NOT GONNA LET THIS MONEY GO AWAY THAT'S FOR SURE. THEY WILL THEN GET UP AND DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO WOULD JUST IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS THAT APPEAR SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BOTH THE TWENTY EIGHT FORTY THREE. THAT WE STOP* FOOTING AROUND AND MAKE UP MY MIND THAT THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE MONEY WE GIVE THEM BECAUSE THAT WE HAVE ALMOST NO OF THE ARM. OF THE OTHER THAN THE COUNTY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN US FOR ONCE AND AND BASICALLY GOLF AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY THREE. I DUCKED WEBER. MR MATHIS. MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. AS MY COLLEAGUE STATED EARLY WE DID DEBATE THIS INSULT ONE. AND WE DID TALK ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW THE COUNTIES NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB. ABOUT SPENDING THESE MONIES. AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE WITH THAT I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO MENTAL HEALTH WE ARE EXTREMELY LACKING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON HELPING OUR PEOPLE OUT. HOWEVER. WITH A V. TWENTY EIGHT FORTY THREE. IT WHAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY DOES IS IT STRIPS AWAY THAT MONEY THAT WE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND GIVES IT. TO THE CITIES FOR PET PROJECTS. SO I'LL ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS LET'S KEEP THE MONEY WITH THE COUNTIES OF MENTAL HEALTH BUT LET'S HAILED OUR COUNTIES TO DO THE RIGHT THING. IT IS SPINEL MONEY ON MENTAL HEALTH WHERE IT BELONGS. BEGIN MEMBERS I ASK FOR A NO VOTE KEEP THE MONEY WITH MENTAL HEALTH DO NOT LET IT GO TO CITY PET PROJECTS. THINK THIS MATHIS SEEING. ALL DEBATE HAVING CEASED. MISTER GLORIA YOU MAY CLOSE. MISTER GLORIA. YOU MAKE LOVE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. WAS THAT WE SPARKED A PRETTY GOOD DEBATE HERE THIS EVENING I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS HOUSE WANTS TO SEE CHANGE AND IT COMES TO PROP SIXTY THREE. ARE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA WENT TO THE POLLS IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR FOURTEEN YEARS AGO AND AUTHORIZE THIS TAX IN THAT LENGTH OF TIMETHIS TAX IS. YIELD AT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TODAY AFTER AS THE STATE AUDITOR REPORTED TWO POINT FIVE BILLION OF IT SITS IN ACCOUNTS ACROSS THE STATE. NOT HELPING A SINGLE SOUL WHO IS GRAPPLING WITH THE ISSUES OF MENTAL ILLNESS MEMBERS NOT ONE OF YOU CAN HAVE A TOWN HALL MEETING WE DON'T HAVE CONSTITUENTS THEY'RE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT HOMELESSNESS. YOU ALL HAVE HOME THAT VETERANS WHO RETURN TO YOUR DISTRICTS DEALING WITH POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS ANOTHER MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES ALL OF YOU HAVE ISSUES OF ADDICTION. AYE IN YOUR COMMUNITIES ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT CHANGE HAS TO HAPPEN THE COUNTIES HAVE HAD FOURTEEN YEARS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS THEY HAVE TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS HOW MANY ISSUES DO WE SPEAK ABOUT ON THIS FLOOR. WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THEM IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE HAVE TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THIS THIS BILL IS AGAIN VERY SIMPLE THEY ALREADY HAVE THREE YEARS THEY MUST BEEN THESE DOLLARS. BACKED INTO THREE YEARS IT IS A IT IS A IS A HOLLOW. DEADLINE BECAUSE THEY KEEP THE MONEY THEY HOLD IN THE COUNT THIS AS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT CITIES THAT HOSPITAL DISTRICTS OTHERS CAN APPLY FOR THESE MONIES WE CAN SAVE LIVES WITH THIS MONEY. THIS MONEY THING A BANK ACCOUNT DOES NOT SAVE A SINGLE LIFE BUT WE CAN DO MORE I HEAR THE CONCERNS IN THIS ROOM I WANT EXTREMELY CLEAR THIS BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS I WORK WITH EVERYONE IN THIS LEGISLATURE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET REAL CHANGE ON THIS BECAUSE TIME'S UP ON THE COUNTIES WE MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CHALLENGE IF YOU HAVE A HOMELESS PERSON YOUR DISTRICT IF YOU HAVE A VETERAN GRAPPLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN WHO NEED A COUNSELOR.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES ARISE RESENT AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY FOUR. THIS IS A BILL THAT SEEKS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH. AND TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. AGAINST HOSPITAL CLOSURES THAT WOULD HAVE DISASTROUS IMPACTS. ON MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO SET THE CONTEXT. ALLOW ME TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND IS HAPPENING. IN MY DISTRICT. I JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. THE MAIN HOSPITAL SERVE. MANY OF THE CONSTITUENTS IN THE RICHMOND SAN PABLO AREA CLOSEST. LEAVING MANY AND MY COMMUNITY. WITHOUT IN EMERGENCY ROOM AND WITHOUT VITAL SERVICES TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES. AND CREATING LONG DELAYS IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT INDIVIDUALS TRAVEL TO SEEK EMERGENCY CARE. AS WE SPEAK ANOTHER HOSPITAL. IS PREPARING TO CLOSE AND ANOTHER LOSS EMERGENCY ROOM AND WE'RE SEEING. THIS TREND ALL ACROSS THE STATE. THE BILL BEFORE YOU. ENVISIONS. A PROCESS WHERE WHEN THEY WILL BE A HOSPITAL CLOSURE. THAT WE WILL MAXIMIZE AS MUCH NOTICE TO THE COMMUNITY AS POSSIBLE SO THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS KNOW ABOUT THE CLOSURES. WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY OF YOU HAD CONCERNS ABOUT. THE ORIGINAL DIRECTION OF THE BILL. AND. BEFORE YOU IS A MOCK UP OF HOW WE INTEND. TO MODIFY AMEND THE BILL. TO PRIORITIZE PROVIDING MORE COMMUNICATION. OF WHAT IS ALREADY REQUIRED THE PROVIDING MORE TIME FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO GET INPUT ABOUT A CLOSURE SO THAT. THEY CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH CARE NEEDS. A VOTE FOR THIS BILL TONIGHT. IS A VOTE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. WE INTEND AMEND THIS BILL TO REMOVE ANY REFERENCE TO APPROVAL OF A CLOSURE FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THIS BILL SIMPLY. WILL BE AMENDED. TO SAY THAT WE MUST GIVE AS MUCH NOTICE AS POSSIBLE.

AND PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY FOUR. THANK YOU WAS THERE IN. SAYING NO DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE BILL. COR CLUB IN THE WRONG. ALL MEMBERS VOTE DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE MR THURBER MOVES A CALL MEMBERS OF FIFTY. AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BY MISTER KALRA CLERK WILL READ. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY CONSUMER LOANS. MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. BUT WITH THE OPTION TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOR YOU TODAY. BY NOW WE HAVE ALL COLLECTIVELY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE. BY NOW WE'VE ALL HAD THE OPPORTUNITY PROCESS AND DIGEST HOW PREDATORY LENDING. HARMS OUR COMMUNITIES. BY NOW WE SHOULD ALL KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO RIGHT A WRONG. TO CORRECT A MISTAKE MADE THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO THAT ALLOWED PREDATORY LENDING TO GAIN A FOOTHOLD. IN OUR STATE. UNDER THE PRETENSE OF INCREASING COMPETITION TO LOWER RATES THIS LEGISLATURE. REMOVED THE RATE STRUCTURE FOR LOANS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SUCCESSIVE LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES. HOWEVER ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SEEN COMPETITION INCREASED OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES WE HAVE NOT SEEN A DECREASE IN RATES. RATHER WE HAVE WATCH RATES SKYROCKET WERE MANY LETTERS NOW ISSUE LOANS WITH INTEREST RATES ANYWHERE FROM ONE HUNDRED PERCENT TO AS HIGH AS THREE HUNDRED PERCENT. IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT NEARLY SIXTY PERCENT OF INSTALLMENT LOANS A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND HAD A PR IS A HUNDRED PERCENT. OR HIGHER. THESE ARE UNCONSCIONABLE INTEREST RATES THAT PLACE SERIOUS AND DEBILITATING IMPACTS ON THE. ECONOMIC SECURITY AND CREDIT OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. DEEP ALL RATES ARE CALMLY AS HIGH AS FORTY PERCENT OR HIGHER. BUT IS TO THAT IS AT LEAST TWO OUT OF EVERY FIVE LOANS OR MORE. THIS IS NOT ACCESS TO CREDIT. THIS IS ACCESS TO UNIMAGINABLE UNMANAGEABLE DEBT. AND DESTROYED CREDIT. THIS IS NOT JUST A POLICY ISSUE THIS IS A MORAL ISSUE. MAKE NO MISTAKE. PERJURY LETTERS NOT JUST USE EXORBITANTLY HIGH INTEREST RATES TO ENTRAP BORROWERS. THE USE LENDING TRACTORS THAT MISLEAD MISREPRESENT ULTIMATELY PENALIZE HARDWORKING AND IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES. THEY SPECIFICALLY MARKET TWENTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR LOANS NOW WHY IS THAT. TO GET ABOVE THE LOAN CAP THAT EXISTS A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND WHERE THEY MARKETED ON HIP HOP STATION SPANISH LANGUAGE STATIONS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. HOW DO I KNOW THIS BECAUSE MY DISTRICT HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST DENSITIES A PREDATORY LENDING STORE FRONTS IN THE STATE? IN FACT THERE ARE MORE FINANCIAL LENDERS IN CALIFORNIA. THE THERE ARE MCDONNELL'S. OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO RESPOND ALL CONCERNS RAISED BY THE ASSEMBLY BANKING AND FINANCE COMMITTEE WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE AMENDMENTS MADE EARLIER THIS WEEK. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR BANKING ON WORKING WITH US ON THOSE. I KEPT MY DOOR OPEN TO ALL PARTIES ESPECIALLY THE OPPOSITION TO WORK WITH ME ON THIS BILL. HOWEVER MANY HAVE REFUSED TO NEGOTIATE BECAUSE THEY'RE UNWILLING TO DISCUSS ANYTHING UNTIL THE RATE CAP IS REMOVED FROM THIS BILL. THAT THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO BRING THEM TO THE TABLE BUT THAT IS SOMETHING I'M UNWILLING TO DO. BECAUSE IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL PANACHE PROTECTION THAT EXISTS IN AT LEAST TWENTY EIGHT OTHER STATES AND IS EXPLICITLY PROVIDED TO FOR UP. FOR OUR ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY UNDER THE FEDERAL MILITARY FUNDING ACT. WHY SHOULD CALIFORNIA STATE THAT IS REGULARLY REFERRED TO AS A LEADER? AND CONSUMER PROTECTION EQUALITY AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE TAKE A STEP BACKWARDS A STEP BEHIND OTHER STATES SUCH AS FLORIDA GEORGIA KANSAS ARKANSAS. KENTUCKY IN OKLAHOMA ALL WHO OPERATE CAP LOWER THAT THIRTY SIX PERCENT TODAY. MANY HAVE BEEN TOLD BLOOD REFUSED TO MEET WITH OPPOSITION BUT ARE NOT ALLOWED CREDIT SURE IS TO BE CALCULATED OUTSIDE THE RATE CAP AND THAT WE HAVE SHIFTED THE GOAL POSTS ON THE BILL. ALL OF THIS IS UNTRUE. FROM THE BEGINNING WE ASSURE THAT THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER THE MILITARY LENDING ACT WHICH IS MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. AND A CLOSE ALL REQUIRES ALL CHARGES FEES AND PRODUCTS TO BE CALCULATED WITHIN THE THIRTY SIX PERCENT CAP. ADDITIONALLY AMENDMENTS MADE THIS WEEK ALLOW CREDIT INSURANCE TO BE OFFERED AND CALCULATED OUTSIDE THE CAB ORIGINATION FEES. TO BE CALCULATED OUTSIDE THE CAB. WE'VE WORKED HARD TO RESPOND TO AN ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF RESPONSIBLE LENDERS AND ALTHOUGH SOME DO NOT SUPPORT. SUPPORT THIS BILL IT DOES REFLECT THEIR CURRENT BUSINESS PRACTICES. THIS BILL AS A MODEL COMPROMISED NEITHER LENDERS NO CONSUMER ADVOCATES ARE PERFECTLY HAPPY. HOWEVER THERE ARE BOTH CERTAINLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL INCLUDING A HUNDRED DIFFERENT ASSUME ADVOCATES AND JURISDICTIONS LIKE THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES CITIES SAMPSON'S GO. CITY OF SAN JOSE AND OTHERS. PRE FINAL POINTS. FIRST OF ALL. THIS IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE THIRTY SECONDS MISTER KALRA TWO THOUSAND SIX GEORGE W. BUSH SET A POLICY OF THIRTY SIX PERCENT CAPITA ALL LOANS. PRESIDENT OBAMA FURTHER STRENGTHENED IT AND. UP IF THOSE MONIES THIRTY STATES HAVE LOANS A BUBBLE CAPS LOWER THAT. NUMBER TWO. ESTATES WERE A CAB THIRTY SIX PERCENT BELOW EXIST CREDIT DID NOT DRY UP YES PREDATORY LENDERS UPTOWN TO RESPONSIBLE LETTERS CREDIT IS A SOCIALLY MINDED BANKS ENTERED THE MARKET DO WHAT IS RIGHT. FINALLY PREDATORY LENDING IS EXPANDING PEOPLE OF COLOR SENIOR SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS ARE BEING TARGETED AT HIGHER RATES IF WE DO NOT WE DO NOTHING TO REGULATE. ALL INSTALLMENT LOANS WOULD ONLY CONTINUE TO GET WORSE ART CONSTITUENTS BETTER ING INSIST. BETTER INSTINCTS TO DETEST. THE SCOURGE OF PREDATORY LENDING OUR OWN BETTER INSTINCTS DEMAND THAT WE ACT AND WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE MISTER TANG. HERE RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU BUT SPEAKER I RISE. AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. LOANS UNDER FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A RETREAT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL LOANS. THE LOANS THAT PEOPLE NEED WHEN THEY'RE IN DESPERATE NEED OF PAYING BILLS PAYING RENT MAKING CRITICAL CRITICAL FINANCIAL DECISIONS. AND ONE OF THE REASONS I'M SUPPORTING MISSED MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE'S BILL. IS A STORY THAT I READ ABOUT IN THE LA TIMES. IT TALKED ABOUT A WOMAN JOANNE HANSON HANSON FOR MENTAL SO SANTA MARGARITA. TWENTY FIFTEEN SHE WAS ACTUALLY QUITE DESPERATE SHE NEEDED TO PAY HER MEDICAL BILLS. SHE WOULD RUN OUT OF ALL DEFERRED OPTIONS SO SHE WHERE IF YOU TOOK A LOAN FOR A LITTLE BIT OVER FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN PERCENT INTEREST. BUT THE HUNDRED IS SIXTEEN PERCENT INTEREST IN WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. OVER SEVEN YEARS THE SHE HAD TO PAY. SHE HAS TO PAY FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH. FOR SEVEN YEARS. FOR A TOTAL PAYMENT BACK OF FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO THAT MEANT THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH AN INTEREST. SHE BY OUR FIVE THOUSAND TO THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ABSOLUTELY HAD TO BE PAID BACK IN INTEREST. NOW THIS LONGER CRITICAL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE COMMUNITIES HERE HAVE ACCESS TO THESE LOANS. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT PEOPLE AREN'T BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND UNFORTUNATELY THE FOLKS GOING TO GET THESE LOANS. ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE AGAIN IN DESPERATE STRAITS. THERE YOU SEE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE BEST CREDIT THEY DON'T HAVE A LINE OF CREDIT THEY'RE NOT HOMEOWNERS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE MENTORS PEOPLE PAY MEDICAL BILLS PEOPLE PAYING. OTHER SORTS OF OUR CREDIT CARD BILLS THINGS THAT ACTUALLY ARE PAST DUE. SO. WE NEED TO FALL WITH SO MANY OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY DON. IN SAID A REASONABLE INTEREST RATE WHERE AGAIN LENDERS CAN MAKE MONEY OKAY THE MAKE MONEY. BUT THE SAME TYPE THAT CONSUMERS DON'T GET DOLLARS BUT THEY DON'T SET. THE. FUTURE. BACKWARDS IN ORDER TO GET THESE LOANS AND THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN RENT OR FOOD OR PAIN DOCTOR LENDERS. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK DRIVER. MISTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I MEMBERS WE'VE WORKED VERY HARD IN THIS LEGISLATURE THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS TO ADDRESS POVERTY. IN CALIFORNIA WE PASSED THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND EVERY YEAR WE ADD TO THAT WE STRENGTHEN CAO WORKS WE STRENGTHEN ALL THESE PROGRAMS THAT ACTUALLY WORK TO LIFT PEOPLE UP OUT OF POVERTY. AND YET WHERE ONE OF THE LAST LARGE STATES THAT ALLOWS. RUN AWAY INTEREST RATES THAT THEN TAKE THOSE SAME PEOPLE WE ARE TRYING TO HELP WITH TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND SEND ALL OF THAT MONEY. INTO POTS WHERE THEY GET INTO THESE DEBT CYCLES THAT THEY CANNOT GET THEMSELVES OUTTA. SO WE ARE KIDDING OURSELVES IF WE THINK WE CAN BENEFIT THE POOR AND NOT PUT STRUCTURES IN PLACE TO TRY AND PROTECT THEM. FROM PREDATORY LENDERS THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER STATES HAVE DONE THIS MANY OF THE STATES HAVE PUT CAPS AND AND THOSE INDUSTRIES SURVIVE. PEOPLE DO HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL WHICH IS ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS IN FACT WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE LEGISLATURE TO THE BANKING COMMITTEE. TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE. FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS OUT THERE FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GET THE CAPITAL THAT THEY NEED. BUT WHY SHOULD JUST A FEW PREDATORY LENDERS BE ABLE TO PULL THAT MUCH MONEY OUT OF OUR THE POOREST CALIFORNIANS IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE AND I RESPECT THAT. ARE AUTHOR FROM. SAN JOSE IN THE WORK THAT HE HAS DONE ON THIS HE'S ACTUALLY MOVE THIS BILL QUITE AWAYS TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE OPPOSITION TRYING TO COME UP WITH REASONABLE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS. I RESPECT THAT WORK AND I THINK WE NEED TO PASS THIS BILL TODAY AND KEEP THIS. CONVERSATION MOVING AND REALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES. MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION FORWARD. I HAPPEN TO LIKE HIM TO LIVE IN A DISTRICT. IN FACT A COMMUNITY WHERE THERE IS LITERALLY A A LOAN AVAILABLE. ON EVERY SINGLE BLOCK IT'S NOT THE KIND OF LOW THAT'S AVAILABLE TO YOU AND I. IT'S A KIND OF LOAN WHERE WHEN YOU BORROW FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE YOUR MOTHER HAS DIED OR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET IMMIGRATION PAPERS IN ORDER. YOU END UP SPENDING THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN A CYCLE OF POVERTY TRYING TO PAY BACK THAT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH ENDS UP FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AS WE SAW FROM THE LA TIMES ARTICLE. THAT'S ALL THAT'S AVAILABLE. I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. I KNOW THAT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE WHERE THERE IS A DESPERATION. FOR CAPITAL IN ORDER TO KEEP YOUR HEAD ABOVE WATER THAT WE CAN PUT SOME SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE THAT ACTUALLY PROTECT CONSUMERS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I REMEMBER THIS BILL COMING TO THE FLOOR. IN AUTHORS DONE A GOOD JOB IN MEETING WITH AND THE OPPONENTS BUT THE INDUSTRIES ANY IS WILLING TO MEET MORE. BUT IF WE'RE NOT WILLING TO TAKE THAT STEP FORWARD AND SAY THAT THIS IS REALLY AN ISSUE AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND WE NEED TO START WORKING ON IT. THAT IT'S NEVER GOING TO CHANGE. AND SO TODAY I ASK EVEN IF IT'S NOT THE PERFECT BILL THAT YOU WOULD LIKE AS A AS A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL I ASK THAT YOU MOVE IT FORWARD SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO ENSURE. THAT THERE IS SOME REASONABLE WAY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO LIVE THEIR LIFE TO BORROW A LITTLE MONEY WHEN THEY HAVE TO WITHOUT SPENDING THE REST OF THEIR LIFE IN A CYCLE OF DEBT BECAUSE THEY FACED EMERGENCY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. MR. THURMOND YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. FAMOUS SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES ARE RISING SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. YEAH SIMPLY PUT THERE SHOULD BE SOME CAP ON THE INTEREST THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE ASKED. PAY ON A LOAN THIS BILL DOES NOT SAY THAT YOU CAN'T MAKE A LOT. OUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT FOR MANY OF THIS HAS BECOME A CHOICE OF OF LANDING A BORROWING. A THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS THAT TO CREATE A SCENARIO. WHERE WHAT YOU'RE PAYING? IS GENERALLY JUST THE INTERESTS. I SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE TO PAY A HUNDRED PERCENT. A PAY AN INTEREST RATE THAT IS A HUNDRED PERCENT. FOR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE. TO HAVE A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR LOAN. BECOME FORTY. SOME THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF DEBT. SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE. I KNOW FOR A FACT THIS AUTHOR WANTS TO WORK WITH THIS SECTOR. AND WITH THE INDUSTRY. TO FIND BALLOTS THAT RESPECTS THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO WANT TO STILL USE THESE PRODUCTS. BUT SIMPLY SAY THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE COUCHED OR BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. AND THAT FOR THOSE WHO. HAVE THE LEAST OPTIONS TO HELP THEM THEY SHOULD NOT BE PUT INTO A SITUATION. WITH A PUT AT RISK THEIR CREDIT HISTORIES PUT AT RISK THEIR FAMILIES ARE PUT AT RISK THEIR POSSESSIONS A PUT AT RISK. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. ALL DISCUSSION HAVING CEASED. KALRA YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH.
