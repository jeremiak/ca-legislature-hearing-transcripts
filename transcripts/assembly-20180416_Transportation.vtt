ABSENT OR LOW INCOME THIS IS

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:55.445 region:rollup2

TO PURCHASE SCHOOL BUSES BUT

01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:05.522 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT BECAUSE THE STATE

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:07.123 region:rollup2
DOES NOT HAVE THE MONEY. THE

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:08.858 region:rollup2

MEMBERS WITH EACH PASSING DAY

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:17.760 region:rollup2
IT'S CARD THAT THE HIGH SPEED

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:19.662 region:rollup2
RAIL PROJECT IS SIMPLY NOT

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.664 region:rollup2
VIABLE. THE RECENT DROP BUSINESS

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:22.732 region:rollup2
PLAN SHOWS JUST HOW UNREALISTIC

01:08:21.664 --> 01:08:23.967 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCT OF THE PROJECT IS

01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:25.702 region:rollup2

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:38.848 region:rollup2
ZERO PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THE

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.083 region:rollup2

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:42.552 region:rollup2
THE STATE CANNOT OFFER MINIMUM

01:08:40.083 --> 01:08:43.720 region:rollup2

WHICH I PROBABLY WILL HAVE A

01:13:26.836 --> 01:13:29.605 region:rollup2
LOT OF.

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:35.044 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION IN THE FUTURE AYE

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:36.445 region:rollup2

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:47.056 region:rollup2
IT WHICH OR THE PEER REVIEW

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:48.090 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY MENTIONED THAT IT IS

01:13:47.056 --> 01:13:50.626 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS GOING TO

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:51.594 region:rollup2
GO TWO HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES.

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:52.328 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE POINTS

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:53.529 region:rollup2
THAT IS A LITTLE BIT

01:13:52.328 --> 01:13:54.030 region:rollup2
DISHEARTENING AND ONE OF THE

01:13:53.529 --> 01:13:54.997 region:rollup2
REASONS WHY I THINK IT'S

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:56.232 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:57.500 region:rollup2
WE DO AS YOU'RE DOING TO SAY

TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:00.303 region:rollup2
WHAT MIGHT BE A BETTER

01:13:58.467 --> 01:14:00.936 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT OF THESE DOLLARS AND

01:14:00.303 --> 01:14:02.538 region:rollup2
THERE'S LOTS OF LEGISLATION TO

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:03.973 region:rollup2

QUESTIONS.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:12.381 region:rollup2
.

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:14.684 region:rollup2
I CERTAINLY AGREE.

01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:15.785 region:rollup2
THERE'S CLEARLY FUNDING GAPS IN

01:14:14.684 --> 01:14:16.352 region:rollup2
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:18.721 region:rollup2

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:20.690 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE A MOTION FROM.

01:14:18.721 --> 01:14:22.925 region:rollup2
MISTER HARPER ANYTHING FROM

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:24.493 region:rollup2
SOME EVER BIGGER MASSACRE WOULD

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:25.828 region:rollup2
LIKE BECAUSE I'M. MIDDLE OF

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:27.830 region:rollup2
SCIENCE AND I APOLOGIZE WHICH

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:28.764 region:rollup2
ARE CLOSE.

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:29.432 region:rollup2
SO.

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:30.766 region:rollup2
NOW THAT EVERYBODY'S GOT IT OFF

01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:32.201 region:rollup2
THEIR CHEST HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:33.536 region:rollup2
HIGH SPEED RAIL.

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:35.371 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT

01:14:33.536 --> 01:14:37.073 region:rollup2
THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO

01:14:35.371 --> 01:14:38.841 region:rollup2
PROVIDE FUNDING FOR BY SERVICE

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:40.810 region:rollup2
TO SCHOOLS.

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:42.611 region:rollup2
OKAY NOW I MENTIONED THE HIGH

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:43.112 region:rollup2
SPEED RAIL IN HERE ARE SOME OF

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:43.980 region:rollup2
OUR WITNESS BOTH FOR AND

01:14:43.112 --> 01:14:46.048 region:rollup2
AGAINST.

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.516 region:rollup2
SPOKE.

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:48.951 region:rollup2
AT LENGTH ABOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:50.519 region:rollup2
BUT THE REALITY IS THIS IS ABOUT

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:52.388 region:rollup2
GETTING OUR KIDS TO AND FROM

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:55.658 region:rollup2
SCHOOL IN A SAFE AND EFFICIENT

01:14:52.388 --> 01:14:57.159 region:rollup2
MANNER WE EVERY MEMBER HAS KIDS

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:58.527 region:rollup2
IN THEIR DISTRICT. WHO HAVE

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:59.829 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY GETTING TO SCHOOL

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:01.630 region:rollup2
EITHER BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:03.366 region:rollup2
CAN'T AFFORD? TO PAY FOR THE

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:04.734 region:rollup2
MONTHLY BUS FEE AND IT IS NOT

01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:06.402 region:rollup2
CHEAP BY THE WHEN YOU HAVE TO

01:15:04.734 --> 01:15:08.070 region:rollup2
PAY PER CHILD NAM THAT FIVE THEM

01:15:06.402 --> 01:15:09.839 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU IT'S NOT. IT'S

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:10.639 region:rollup2
NOT AN INEXPENSIVE VENTURE I'M

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:12.241 region:rollup2
EITHER THEIR PARENTS DON'T HAVE

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:14.143 region:rollup2
THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE SCHOOL

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:14.977 region:rollup2
BUS OR THEY'RE JUST WITHIN THAT

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:16.912 region:rollup2
CERTAIN DISTANCE WHERE THEY

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:18.481 region:rollup2
DON'T QUALIFY. TO GET ON THE BUS

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:19.615 region:rollup2
THEIR VARIETY OF REASONS ARE A

01:15:18.481 --> 01:15:21.016 region:rollup2
LOT OF AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:23.019 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NO SIDEWALKS IT'S NOT

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:24.987 region:rollup2
SAFE EVEN FOR THEM TO BE WALKING

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:27.423 region:rollup2
TO SCHOOL. SO WE'RE GOING TO

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:29.125 region:rollup2
PASS LEGISLATION THAT FUNDS.

01:15:27.423 --> 01:15:30.493 region:rollup2
MEAL PROGRAMS FOR KIDS TO MAKE

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:31.694 region:rollup2
SURE THEY'RE FAT IN THEIR BRAINS

01:15:30.493 --> 01:15:33.229 region:rollup2
HAD THE ENERGY THEY NEED TO

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:35.131 region:rollup2
LEARN DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR.

01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:37.566 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO FIND MORE.

01:15:35.131 --> 01:15:39.568 region:rollup2
RESOURCES FOR THE TEACHERS AND

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:40.603 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO PUT ALL THESE

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:42.271 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS INTO THE SCHOOLS.

01:15:40.603 --> 01:15:43.506 region:rollup2
WHEN IT MAKES SENSE IF WE MADE

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:44.774 region:rollup2
SURE THE KIDS COULD ACTUALLY GET

01:15:43.506 --> 01:15:46.542 region:rollup2
TO SCHOOL.

01:15:44.774 --> 01:15:47.910 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:49.111 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS IS A NO BRAINER

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:50.746 region:rollup2
LET'S JUST GET THE KIDS TO

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:51.747 region:rollup2
SCHOOL VERY SIMPLE THAT'S THE

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:54.216 region:rollup2
BIGGEST OBSTACLES GETTING THEM

01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:55.518 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:57.286 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING IS FOR THE

01:15:55.518 --> 01:15:58.888 region:rollup2
FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THESE KIDS

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:59.422 region:rollup2
GET TO SCHOOL SAID THEY CAN TAKE

01:15:58.888 --> 01:16:00.656 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE OTHER

01:15:59.422 --> 01:16:02.691 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:04.193 region:rollup2
PUT INTO PLACE. TO GREET THEM

01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:05.394 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY WALK THROUGH THE DOORS

CERTAINLY HAVING DMV ENGAGED ON.

01:25:41.737 --> 01:25:44.606 region:rollup2

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:51.947 region:rollup2
OF THE DRIVING PUBLIC. BUT ALSO

IT IS IN A TWO WEEKS. OF STREET

01:25:51.947 --> 01:25:56.284 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY NO PUN

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:58.420 region:rollup2
INTENDED VERSUS OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:59.788 region:rollup2
A LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SORT OF BE

01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:01.556 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN THAT CREATES A BETTER

01:25:59.788 --> 01:26:03.458 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE INFORMATION AND

01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:04.426 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SHARING. A TOO OFTEN

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:06.428 region:rollup2
WE SEE.

01:26:04.426 --> 01:26:10.098 region:rollup2
CONFLICTS HAPPEN AND MAYBE THEY

01:26:06.428 --> 01:26:10.565 region:rollup2
DID NOT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BECAUSE

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:11.133 region:rollup2

.

01:26:11.133 --> 01:26:14.770 region:rollup2
REDUCED BASED ON INFORMATION AND

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:16.304 region:rollup2
HOW BEST TO ENGAGE UNDER CERTAIN

01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:18.106 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES CIRCUMSTANCES AND

01:26:16.304 --> 01:26:19.908 region:rollup2

THAT THE DMV CAN PLAY WE'RE

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:24.046 region:rollup2

WITH LOOK LIKE AND THE LANGUAGE

01:26:26.148 --> 01:26:29.484 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT BY ENGAGING

01:26:27.616 --> 01:26:30.686 region:rollup2
THEM HAVING THEM VIA STAKEHOLDER

01:26:29.484 --> 01:26:33.188 region:rollup2
IN THE PROCESS I THINK THAT

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:34.856 region:rollup2
ALLOWS US TO. GET THE MAXIMUM

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:36.858 region:rollup2
OUT OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT.

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:37.592 region:rollup2

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:39.728 region:rollup2
SAY THAT THERE AREN'T.

01:26:37.592 --> 01:26:40.929 region:rollup2

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:53.175 region:rollup2
ELEMENT OF.

01:26:51.506 --> 01:26:54.576 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CONVERSATION THAT

01:26:53.175 --> 01:26:56.344 region:rollup2
GIVES US A.

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:59.147 region:rollup2
A MORE APPROPRIATE OR A BETTER

WAS RECOGNIZED AS AN APPROPRIATE

01:27:13.528 --> 01:27:16.364 region:rollup2
WAY TO MOVE FORWARD.
