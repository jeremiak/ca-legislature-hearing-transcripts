FESTERING FOR MANY MANY MANY

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:14.360
MANY YEARS- AND ARE NOW BEING

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:16.229
SHOWN FOR WHAT THEY ARE AND THE

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:17.864
HARM THAT THEY'RE CAUSING INTO

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.132
CALIFORNIANS. EVERY DAY AND

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.535
AMONG THOSE- IS HOUSING AND WE

WITH. PEOPLE STILL CAN'T AFFORD

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:26.772
HOUSING HOUSING IS STILL

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.341
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE IN SOME

00:08:28.407 --> 00:08:30.376
WAYS MORE EXPENSIVE. PEOPLE ARE

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:31.744
STILL GETTING AFFECTED AND

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:33.679

BECOMING SADLY MORE NUMEROUS-

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:42.755
THAN THEY WERE. BEFORE AND I

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:43.923
KNOW THAT A BIG FOCUS IS THAT

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.360
HEARING- AND I SUPPORT THIS IS

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:50.229
THE TRIAGE. OF HELPING PEOPLE

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:51.197
WHO ARE HOMELESS WHETHER

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:52.598
THEY'RE ON OUR STREETS LIVING

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:56.769
IN CARS- COUCHSURFING- OR

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:57.970
WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE WITH

00:08:58.037 --> 00:08:59.972
THE TRIAGE. OF HELPING GETTING

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:03.175
THEM STABILIZE AND THE HOUSING.

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:04.510
THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:06.479
BUT WE ALSO AS WE DO THAT WE

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:08.814
CAN NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF WHY IT

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:10.516
IS A CALIFORNIA HAS SO MANY

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:13.419
HOMELESS PEOPLE. CALIFORNIA HAS

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:16.522
13% OF. THE POPULATION OF THIS

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:19.592
COUNTRY THIRTEEN PERCENT. BY

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:21.727
25% OF THE NATION'S HOMELESS

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:24.630
POPULATION AND A MAJORITY OF

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:26.532
THE NATION'S UNSHELTERED

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:29.869
HOMELESS POPULATION. 13% OF THE

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:31.971
POPULATION IS COUNTRY BUT

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:33.306
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE

00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:34.540
NATION'S HOMELESS POPULATION

00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:36.609
AND A MAJORITY. OF THE

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:37.944
UNSHELTERED HOMELESS POPULATION

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.980
I SAID THAT TWICE BECAUSE IT IS

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:43.916
SHOCKING AND APPALLING. AND

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:46.085
IT'S NOT JUST RANDOM. THAT WE

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:47.920
HAVE SUCH A DISPROPORTIONATE

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:49.922
HOMELESS POPULATION IN

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:51.524
CALIFORNIA COMPARED THE REST OF

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.159
THE COUNTRY THAT IS RANDOMLY

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:55.728
HAPPENED. IT WAS AN ACT OF GOD

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:58.898
IT WASN'T JUST RANDOM IT WAS

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:02.969
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA. IT HAS A

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:04.537
PROFOUND HOUSING SHORTAGE

00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:06.605
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS HAD

00:10:06.672 --> 00:10:09.308
ADOPTED AN AWFUL HOUSING POLICY

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:11.277
OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. WE

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:12.678
DECIDED THAT IT'S NOT A

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:15.081
PRIORITY TO HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING

00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:17.283
FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT AND NOT

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.952
JUST PUSHES EVERYONE DOWN IT

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:21.721
MEANS THAT FAMILIES THAT USED

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:22.955
TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO BUY A

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:25.257
HOME CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY A HOME

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:26.792
ANYMORE MEANS OF FAMILIES AND

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:28.027
MAY HAVE HAD A LARGE ENOUGH

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:29.829
APARTMENT FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:32.531
FIVE. NOW HAVE A VERY SMALL

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:34.467
APARTMENT OR HAVE TO DOUBLE UP

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:36.469
WITH OTHER FAMILIES. SENATE

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:37.470
MEANS THAT PEOPLE WHO IN THE

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:39.305
PAST WILL BE ABLE TO AT LEAST

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:40.973
AFFORD SOME SORT OF APARTMENT

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.275
WHETHER IT'S A SINGLE ROOM OR A

00:10:43.342 --> 00:10:45.778
SMALL APARTMENT- OR WITH A

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:48.180
ROOMMATE. ARE NOW LIVING IN

00:10:48.247 --> 00:10:50.683
CARS OR COUCH SURFING OR ON THE

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.584
STREETS OR IN A HOMELESS

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.886
SHELTER IT PUSHES EVERYONE

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:57.723
DOWN- AND SO AS WE WORK ON THIS

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.694
TRIAGE. TO HELP GET PEOPLE OFF

00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:03.596

PRODUCTION OF MORE HOUSING.

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:15.141
WHEN TRYING TO REMOVE THE

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:16.008
OBSTACLES TO HAVING ENOUGH

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:17.877
HOUSING. THAT THAT TIES

00:11:17.943 --> 00:11:20.046
DIRECTLY. INTO PREVENTING

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:21.647
HOMELESSNESS FROM HAPPENING IN

00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:23.716
THE FIRST PLACE IT IS MUCH

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:24.283
BETTER TO PREVENT IT FROM

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.118
HAPPENING. THEN THEY HAVE TO

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.521
TRIAGE. ONCE IT'S HAPPENED SO

00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:29.722
IT'S ALWAYS REMEMBER THAN A

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:30.656

RATE AND PEOPLE GO TO. TO

00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:57.336
BIGGER BOX STORES BECAUSE THEY

HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HAVE LOWER

00:13:58.671 --> 00:13:59.738

WOULDN'T THE FIRST QUESTION I

00:44:54.491 --> 00:44:56.627
HAVE IS WHAT WHAT EFFORTS HAVE

00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:59.096
BEEN MADE- THROUGH THE- EITHER

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:01.065
THE- PROJECT ROOM CARE HOME

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:03.934
KEY. TO MAKE SURE THAT SMALL

00:45:04.001 --> 00:45:05.169
RURAL COMMUNITIES CAN ACCESS

00:45:05.235 --> 00:45:07.237
THE RESOURCES. ON THOSE

00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:09.406
COMMUNITIES GENERALLY SPEAKING

00:45:09.473 --> 00:45:12.109
ARE LESS NIMBLE. AND HAVE LESS

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:15.179
STAFF. THAT DEALS SPECIFICALLY

00:45:15.245 --> 00:45:18.082
WITH- THE HOMELESS ISSUES. AND

00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:19.850
SO AND I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE I

00:45:19.917 --> 00:45:21.752
TOOK A LOOK AT THE LIST OF. OF

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:23.887
THE GRANT AND- A LARGE

00:45:23.954 --> 00:45:25.522
PERCENTAGE OF THE GRANTS WENT

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:27.224
TO THE BIG WELL ACTUALLY. AT

00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:29.193
LARGE A LARGE PERCENT.

00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:30.160
PERCENTAGE WENT TO THE BIG

00:45:30.227 --> 00:45:33.497
CITIES. AND A HUGE PERCENTAGE-

00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:35.299
I HAD A NUMBER BUT CAN'T FIND

00:45:35.365 --> 00:45:36.600
IT WENT TO LOS ANGELES WE KNOW

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:38.869
THAT ALI HAD. A TERRIBLE. ISSUE

00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:40.571
BUT WE ALL DO AND SO THE

00:45:40.637 --> 00:45:42.506
QUESTION BECOMES. HOW CAN WE

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:44.508
MAKE SURE THAT RURAL CALIFORNIA

00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:45.809
KING CAN ACCESS THESE FUNDS AS

00:45:45.876 --> 00:45:48.045
WELL- WHY THE HIGH VCANCY

00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:49.780
RATE- I IT SOMEWHERE I READ

00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:51.348
THAT 65% OF THE UNITS ARE

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:53.984
OCCUPIED SEEMS TO ME. THAT

00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:55.953
MOTEL ROOMS ARE MOVABLE HE CAN

00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:58.088
MOVE IN AND YES YOU'D PROBABLY

00:45:58.155 --> 00:45:59.823
WANT TO. READ TO THEM A LITTLE

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:02.960
BIT- BUT BUT WHY DO IT NOW IN

00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:04.228
THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC WHY

00:46:04.294 --> 00:46:07.865
NOT. GET JUST GET PEOPLE IN A

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:09.800
BAD. IN THEN I WANT THIS IS NOT

00:46:09.867 --> 00:46:12.469
THE SUBJECT OF A OF. THE

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:14.071
HEARING TODAY BUT IT IS

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:16.206
PROBABLY JUST AS IMPORTANT

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:17.207
WHICH IS THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:19.143
FUNNELING A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF

00:46:19.209 --> 00:46:20.477
THE RESOURCES THAT THE STATE

00:46:20.544 --> 00:46:22.513
GRANTS THROUGH OUR BUDGET. TO

00:46:22.579 --> 00:46:24.047
THE COMMUNITIES OF CARE CECILIA

00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:28.952
SIS AND ON AND- THERE THERE ARE

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:30.888
THIS YEAR SHE WAS SET UP. BY

00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:33.357
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND IN

00:46:33.423 --> 00:46:37.027
MY MIND LEAVE SOME REAL ISSUES.

00:46:37.094 --> 00:46:38.629
UNRESOLVED BECAUSE IT'S NOT A

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:40.597
PUBLIC BODY NECESSARILY THEY

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:41.832
DON'T HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:43.734
BROWN ACT OR ANY OF THOSE KINDS

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.537
OF REQUIREMENTS. AND THEY DON'T

00:46:46.603 --> 00:46:49.006
NECESSARILY REQUIRED THAT IF

00:46:49.072 --> 00:46:50.774
YOU WANT TO GET A GRANT YOU

00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:52.109
CAN'T SERVE ON THE BOARD TO FOR

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:53.510
EXAMPLE YOU CAN SERVE ON THE

00:46:53.577 --> 00:46:55.279
BOARD AND SAY HEY WE ARE AGENCY

00:46:55.345 --> 00:46:57.381
NEEDS MONEY AND- IT CAN BE

00:46:57.447 --> 00:47:00.184
GRANTED AND THAT. OBVIOUSLY IS

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:01.885
A SITUATION THAT CREATES.

00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:03.520
CHALLENGES AND THEN WE DON'T

00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:05.155
REQUIRE THEM TO REPORT

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:07.124
INFORMATION TO US IN A WAY THAT

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:08.625
GIVES THE SENATE THE ABILITY TO

00:47:08.692 --> 00:47:11.395
SEE WHETHER THEY'RE- ACTUALLY

00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:12.863
TAKING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:14.965
WHETHER THEY'RE SATISFYING- AND

00:47:15.032 --> 00:47:16.333
WITH THAT REQUIREMENTS SAID

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:19.303
THAT OF THE GRANT IS AND IT SO

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:19.970
IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:21.605
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF. OF

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:23.640
INFORMATION THAT WE SHOULD

00:47:23.707 --> 00:47:25.943
REQUIRE AS PART OF THIS GRANT

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:27.110
SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AND

00:47:27.177 --> 00:47:27.978
DETERMINE WHETHER SOME

00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:29.079
COMMUNITIES ARE DOING A BETER

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:31.148
JOB IN THE COMMUNITY SO. THAT

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:33.717
THAT- I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT WE

00:47:33.784 --> 00:47:36.153
AS WE DEVELOP OUR PACKAGE THAT

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.555

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:40.824
OUR MONEY WISELY AND THAT WERE

00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:43.160
ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:44.895
STREET. MORE IMPORTANTLY

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:45.729

THAT NATURE TO. TRY TO ACCESS

01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:15.818
THE PRIVATE HOUSE MARKET BUT

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:16.919
ALSO QUITE TO THE FACT THAT

PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES THAT

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:37.306
NEED TO BE BELIEVE AS

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:39.609
CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT FOCUSING ON

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:40.910
RACIAL EQUITY AND JUSTICE

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:42.445
FOCUSING ON THE FACT THAT

GREAT START ON HOW DO WE GET TO

01:37:01.115 --> 01:37:02.950
SOLVE ANY PROBLEMS FOR

01:37:03.017 --> 01:37:06.220
CALIFORNIANS BUT- HILL I WAS

01:37:06.287 --> 01:37:07.454
READING AN ARTICLE NOT TOO LONG

01:37:07.521 --> 01:37:11.125
AGO AND- IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT

01:37:11.192 --> 01:37:13.928
HOW TO APPROACH. ALL THE POPUP

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:14.795

WITH THE WERE HAVING HERE

01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:18.299
TODAY. IN CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND

01:37:18.365 --> 01:37:20.100
AND THAT'S- CLIMATE CHANGE

01:37:20.167 --> 01:37:24.038
ADAPTATION- WE NEED TO. BE

01:37:24.104 --> 01:37:26.473
ADAPTING RATHER THAN TRYING TO

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:29.977
PREVENT WHAT IS ALREADY HERE.

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:33.013
AND I WAS READING THROUGH THE

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:33.814
ARTICLE THE GREAT CLIMATE

01:37:33.881 --> 01:37:36.884
MIGRATION- THAT WAS- POSTED ON

01:37:36.951 --> 01:37:39.553
THE NEW YORK TIMES. AND IT

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:41.088
MENTIONS THE STORY OF A- OF A

01:37:41.155 --> 01:37:44.091
SMALL FARMER OUT OF GUATEMALA.

01:37:44.158 --> 01:37:46.694
AND HOW THE DROUGHT BASICALLY

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:49.196
FORCED HIM AND HIS FAMILY OUT

01:37:49.263 --> 01:37:51.966
OF OUT OF THIS COUNTRY- THEY

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:53.801
WERE FACING STARVATION THEY

01:37:53.867 --> 01:37:57.972
WERE- DIDN'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO.

01:37:58.038 --> 01:37:59.673
AT YOU KNOW TO SLEEP- AND IT

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:01.408
MADE ME THINK A LOT ABOUT WHAT

01:38:01.475 --> 01:38:02.643
WE'RE FACING HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:04.278
WITH THE FIRES AND PEOPLE BEING

01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:05.679
DISPLACED IT MADE ME THINK

01:38:05.746 --> 01:38:07.381
ABOUT JUST EVEN RECENTLY MY

01:38:07.448 --> 01:38:09.183
SISTER WHO I HAVE ACTUALLY

01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:10.150
ENTIRE FAMILY THAT LIVES IN

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:11.685
TEXAS AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN

01:38:11.752 --> 01:38:13.621
DISPLACED BECAUSE OF THE-

01:38:13.687 --> 01:38:16.590
EXTREME. WEATHER THAT THE FEAST

01:38:16.657 --> 01:38:17.891
THERE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY

01:38:17.958 --> 01:38:20.327
WITHOUT WATER. AND THE REALITY

01:38:20.394 --> 01:38:21.929
IS THAT IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET

01:38:21.996 --> 01:38:23.931
WORSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:38:23.998 --> 01:38:25.165
ACROSS THE NATION IN THE CAR

01:38:25.232 --> 01:38:27.001
ACROSS THE WORLD BUT HOW DO WE

01:38:27.067 --> 01:38:29.370
ADAPT TO BEASTIES. TO THIS NEW

01:38:29.436 --> 01:38:33.274
THIS IS NEW CIRCUMSTANCES. AND

01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:34.875
I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S-

01:38:34.942 --> 01:38:37.211
WHAT'S WHAT AMALA- IT'S FAR

01:38:37.278 --> 01:38:39.146
AWAY THEY'RE MIGRATING NORTH.

01:38:39.213 --> 01:38:40.547
THE REALITY IS THAT IT'S

01:38:40.614 --> 01:38:42.816
HAPPENING HERE IN CALIFORNIA-

01:38:42.883 --> 01:38:44.885
WHERE I THINK PEOPLE ARE

01:38:44.952 --> 01:38:47.521
MIGRATING BECAUSE OF THAT THE

01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:50.157
CHALLENGES THAT. CLIMATE CHANGE

01:38:50.224 --> 01:38:52.426
IS ALREADY CREATING AND I

01:38:52.493 --> 01:38:55.629
THINK- ABOUT HOW DO WE HOW DO

01:38:55.696 --> 01:38:57.131

01:38:57.197 --> 01:38:59.900
PEOPLE FROM STARVATION HOW DO

01:38:59.967 --> 01:39:02.836
WE- IT'S A TOPIC WE HAVE TO

01:39:02.903 --> 01:39:03.704
REALLY THINK ABOUT IT AS A

01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:05.572

IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND

01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:53.981
IT WAS. AN. EMERGENCY CONTINUES

01:40:54.047 --> 01:40:54.848
TO BE AN EMERGENCY. WE WERE A

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:56.550
TO. US HUNDRED AND SEVEN

01:40:56.617 --> 01:40:59.153
HOMELESS PEOPLE IN HOTELS

01:40:59.219 --> 01:41:01.889
MOTELS THAT WERE RENTED. IN THE

01:41:01.955 --> 01:41:03.157

WOODLAND AND THE CITY OF WEST

01:41:04.491 --> 01:41:06.960
SACRAMENTO. BUT WE WERE ABLE TO

01:41:07.027 --> 01:41:09.496
DO THIS QUICKLY AND- IN DOING

01:41:09.563 --> 01:41:10.697
THIS WE WERE ABLE TO PROTECT

01:41:10.764 --> 01:41:11.932
PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE IT WAS

01:41:11.999 --> 01:41:13.667
OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE DURING

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:15.969
THE PANDEMIC TO PREVENT

01:41:16.036 --> 01:41:18.071
OUTBREAKS INVITE. USE THEM FOR

01:41:18.138 --> 01:41:19.440
PEOPLE WHO NEED TO HOMELESS

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:20.641
PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE ISOLATED

01:41:20.707 --> 01:41:22.876
WE ALSO. WERE PROTECTING THE

WHO WERE UN HOUSED WELL WE'RE

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:32.653
PLACED IN THE HOTELS WE BELIEVE

01:41:32.719 --> 01:41:33.787
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PLACE

01:41:33.854 --> 01:41:36.657
EVERYBODY IN THAT CATEGORY

01:41:36.723 --> 01:41:39.059
THAT- THAT WANTED TO BE PLACED.

01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:40.661
BUT THAT ALSO RELIEVED PRESSURE

01:41:40.727 --> 01:41:41.862
AT THE SHELTERS BECAUSE THERE

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:43.630
WAS LESS LESS DEMAND ON THE

01:41:43.697 --> 01:41:48.001
SHELTERS. FOR DISTANCING AND WE

01:41:48.068 --> 01:41:49.670

THERE AND KEEP THEM SAFE AND WE

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:58.645
DID. AVOID AN OUTBREAK. SO IT

01:41:58.712 --> 01:42:04.718
WAS SIX HUNDRED HOMELESS PEOPLE.

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:05.519
SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND. NIGHTS

WHEN WE WENT INTO THIS- HOW

01:42:12.593 --> 01:42:13.994
THINGS WOULD GO DOWN BOTH THE

01:42:14.061 --> 01:42:15.863
MOTELS WE USED IN DAVIS I

01:42:15.929 --> 01:42:19.633

WE'RE AT HOMELESS OR NOT HOUSE

01:42:35.182 --> 01:42:37.017
IN THIS SITUATION ONE OF THE

01:42:37.084 --> 01:42:38.385
REASONS IS ONE OF THE

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:39.386

02:21:38.790 --> 02:21:40.692
LOCAL GUY PRESENTERS WOULD WANT

02:21:40.758 --> 02:21:43.895
TO COMMENT IT WOULD HELPFUL. I

02:21:43.962 --> 02:21:45.263
SHOULD WAIT TO TALK IN THIS

02:21:45.330 --> 02:21:47.165
SECTION BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF

02:21:47.232 --> 02:21:48.967
OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS. WITH

02:21:49.033 --> 02:21:51.603
HOMELESSNESS THE FALLS ON LOCAL

02:21:51.669 --> 02:21:57.976
GOVERNMENT. AND I. WILL POINT

02:21:58.042 --> 02:22:01.012
TO VARIOUS EXECUTIVE BRANCHES

02:22:01.079 --> 02:22:02.847
OVER MANY YEARS. N.

02:22:02.914 --> 02:22:05.850
LEGISLATURES OVER MANY YEARS

02:22:05.917 --> 02:22:08.219
WHICH OF HELP CREATE THIS

02:22:08.286 --> 02:22:15.827
PROBLEM. HOW BY DOING A KIND OF

02:22:15.894 --> 02:22:17.829
A PUNCHES PILOTS TAKING THE

02:22:17.896 --> 02:22:19.697
PROBLEMS OF THE FALL AND STATE

02:22:19.764 --> 02:22:22.667
GOVERNMENT AND DUMP IT. ON

02:22:22.734 --> 02:22:25.603
LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THAT'S

02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:27.038
HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND

02:22:27.105 --> 02:22:28.606
AGAIN THE MOST RECENTLY THE

02:22:28.673 --> 02:22:31.109
LONG PERIOD OF TIME WHICH IS

02:22:31.175 --> 02:22:34.045
BEEN CALLED REALIGNMENT. THE

02:22:34.112 --> 02:22:36.114
REAL ESSENCE OF REALIGNMENT HAS

02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:36.614
BEEN DUMPING THE STATE'S

02:22:36.681 --> 02:22:38.416
PROBLEMS. ON THE CITY'S

02:22:38.483 --> 02:22:42.420
MECHANICS. AND I SPEAK IN THIS

02:22:42.487 --> 02:22:43.888
SECTION BECAUSE I'M MORE OF A

02:22:43.955 --> 02:22:45.023
COUNTY PERSON THAN A CITY

02:22:45.089 --> 02:22:49.394
PERSON. WHAT DO I MEAN. CANDIES

02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:52.997
HAVE MORE MANDATES. THE FALL ON

02:22:53.064 --> 02:22:54.866
THEM THE CITIES AND LESSER

02:22:54.933 --> 02:22:57.168
RESOURCES TO ACCOMPLISH THAT

02:22:57.235 --> 02:23:00.805
BILITY. TO FIND RESOURCES THAT

02:23:00.872 --> 02:23:02.040
DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE WELL OFF

02:23:02.106 --> 02:23:03.641
THEY ARE THEY SET FOR JUST TO

02:23:03.708 --> 02:23:08.079
SAY. IT OVER THE YEARS THIS

02:23:08.146 --> 02:23:10.615
STATE IN REALIGNING. AS DR SO

02:23:10.682 --> 02:23:15.019
MANY. INTO OUR COMMUNITIES MANY

02:23:15.086 --> 02:23:16.821
OF HOME HAD BECOME THIS GROWING

02:23:16.888 --> 02:23:19.457
BURGEONING. AN OPPRESSIVE

02:23:19.524 --> 02:23:23.962
POPULATION. OF HOMELESSNESS.

02:23:24.028 --> 02:23:25.763
ENDED UP BEING THAT HAS

02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:29.500
OCCURRED WITHOUT. COMMENSURATE

02:23:29.567 --> 02:23:31.903
ASSIGNMENT OF RESOURCES TO OUR

02:23:31.970 --> 02:23:33.504
LOCAL COMMUNITIES COUNTIES

02:23:33.571 --> 02:23:38.443
CITIES. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:23:38.509 --> 02:23:41.079
THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION.

02:23:41.145 --> 02:23:42.246
THIRTY THREE MENTAL HEALTH

02:23:42.313 --> 02:23:45.550
NEEDS FOR EXAMPLE. AND

02:23:45.616 --> 02:23:48.186
DANGEROUS INDIVIDUALS HAVE IN

02:23:48.252 --> 02:23:49.487
ARE BEING PLACED IN OUR

02:23:49.554 --> 02:23:51.522
COMMUNITIES AND THEY HAVE

02:23:51.589 --> 02:23:53.091
LITTLE ABILITY TO DEAL WITH

02:23:53.157 --> 02:23:56.894
THEM. I HEAR WHAT THE LOCAL

02:23:56.961 --> 02:23:59.430
GOVERNMENT PEOPLE SAY. AND

02:23:59.497 --> 02:24:02.233
THEIR FRUSTRATION AT NOT BEING

02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:03.935
ABLE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

02:24:04.002 --> 02:24:05.770
PRO FRIDAY ACCOMMODATIONS IN

02:24:05.837 --> 02:24:08.940
THE TREATMENT. GENERAL

02:24:09.007 --> 02:24:11.275
INCULCATED THEN AND WHATEVER WE

02:24:11.342 --> 02:24:16.180
DO REGARDING. THE HOMELESS. WE

02:24:16.247 --> 02:24:19.017
NEED TO COUPLE THAT. WITH

02:24:19.083 --> 02:24:20.785
RESOURCES TO HELP THOSE

02:24:20.852 --> 02:24:23.521
INDIVIDUALS NOT SIMPLY FIND

02:24:23.588 --> 02:24:26.290
SHELTER. THAT'S KIND OF A

02:24:26.357 --> 02:24:28.960
HOLLOW PROMISE. BUT A DRESS

02:24:29.027 --> 02:24:30.795
SOME OF THE PERSONAL NEEDS OF

02:24:30.862 --> 02:24:34.298
THESE INDIVIDUALS. I ENVISION

02:24:34.365 --> 02:24:36.100
SOMETHING LIKE IN THE DUCATION

02:24:36.167 --> 02:24:37.301
THE I. E. P. INDIVIDUAL

02:24:37.368 --> 02:24:40.104
EDUCATION PLAN MORE BY. THAT

02:24:40.171 --> 02:24:43.374
INDIVIDUAL HOMELESS PERSON. HIS

02:24:43.441 --> 02:24:47.011
CHEST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHAT

02:24:47.078 --> 02:24:48.379
ARE THEIR NEEDS BEYOND JUST

02:24:48.446 --> 02:24:53.684
SHELTER. AND THEN HELPED DEVISE

02:24:53.751 --> 02:24:56.421
A PLAN FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL. TO

02:24:56.487 --> 02:24:59.223
DEVELOP CAPABILITIES TO BE ABLE

02:24:59.290 --> 02:25:01.426
TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES. BE ON

02:25:01.492 --> 02:25:06.330
THE STREET. AND TO ASSIST THEM.

02:25:06.397 --> 02:25:09.467
WITH SOME OF THEIR NEEDS. IT

02:25:09.534 --> 02:25:10.101
WOULD BRING TO PEOPLE'S

02:25:10.168 --> 02:25:13.204
ATTENTION A CLASSIFICATION OF

02:25:13.271 --> 02:25:17.608
COUNTIES. OFTEN IT JUST THOUGHT.

02:25:17.675 --> 02:25:22.180

NEW TERM NOW THERE'S ALSO BEEN

02:25:24.549 --> 02:25:27.952

REPRESENT THAT ARE

02:25:40.698 --> 02:25:42.233
TRANSITIONING FROM BEING

02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:45.570
BASICALLY RURAL COUNTIES. INTO

02:25:45.636 --> 02:25:48.539
SUBURBAN AND THEN MET WITH EVEN

SOME CASES SEVEN CASH. AND

02:25:50.875 --> 02:25:52.376
THOSE COUNTIES HAVE DIFFERENT

02:25:52.443 --> 02:25:54.579
KINDS OF NEEDS A PARTICULAR

02:26:10.027 --> 02:26:12.997
THE LACK OF THOSE WHO LIVE IN

02:26:13.064 --> 02:26:13.498
THOSE VALLEY CITIES AND

02:26:13.564 --> 02:26:17.468

ALLEVIATE SOME OF OUR BURDENS.

02:26:33.818 --> 02:26:36.020
AND THEN WE OPPOSE THEM ON OUR

02:26:36.087 --> 02:26:37.622
LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITHOUT

02:26:37.688 --> 02:26:39.790

COUNTIES THAT WILL RESULT IN A

02:27:13.191 --> 02:27:14.091
IN A MANDATE AND ADDITIONAL

LIKE PROJECT ROOM KEY- DURING

02:27:20.064 --> 02:27:21.799
THE PANDEMIC IS THAT THEY WORK

02:27:21.866 --> 02:27:24.402
ENTIRELY FINANCED- SO WE DIDN'T

02:27:24.468 --> 02:27:26.470

AND I THINK THAT'S AN APPROACH

02:27:46.724 --> 02:27:49.760
THAT'S PROVING SUCCESSFUL.

02:27:49.827 --> 02:27:50.628

COUNTY WHICH- PART OF WHICH I

02:29:56.454 --> 02:30:02.026
DO REPRESENT- SO. ONE THREE THE

02:30:02.093 --> 02:30:02.660
END THIS HERE WE START OFF BY

02:30:02.727 --> 02:30:04.795
TWO ABOUT. THE FACT THAT WE

02:30:04.862 --> 02:30:05.296
NEED A GREATER SUPPLY OF

02:30:05.363 --> 02:30:09.233
HOUSING- IN MANY CASES NOT ALL

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:11.502
OF THOSE DECISIONS BUT- THOSE

02:30:11.569 --> 02:30:12.970
ASIANS ARE LAND USE DECISIONS

02:30:13.037 --> 02:30:15.072
MADE BY CITIES AND SOME ARE

02:30:15.139 --> 02:30:17.475
MADE BY COUNTIES- SAME TIME WE

02:30:17.541 --> 02:30:19.944
TALK ABOUT WRAPAROUND SERVICES-

02:30:20.010 --> 02:30:22.313
AND I KNOW THAT IS- SOMEONE DO

02:30:22.380 --> 02:30:24.081
WITH THE PASTURE OF- BUT JUST

02:30:24.148 --> 02:30:25.516
SOME THREE THAT. A LOT OF THAT

02:30:25.583 --> 02:30:27.451
IS ACTUALLY DELEGATED TO

02:30:27.518 --> 02:30:29.120
COUNTIES AND APPRECIATE- CENTER

02:30:29.186 --> 02:30:30.488
NIELSEN BRING UP SOME OF THAT

02:30:30.554 --> 02:30:35.626
ISSUE AS WELL- SO. I GUESS THE

02:30:35.693 --> 02:30:37.128
QUESTION I HAVE IS THE

02:30:37.194 --> 02:30:38.929
INTEGRATION BETWEEN CITY

02:30:38.996 --> 02:30:40.731
DECISION MAKING WHICH INVOLVES

02:30:40.798 --> 02:30:44.001
LAND USE AND- YOU KNOW HOUSING.

02:30:44.068 --> 02:30:45.669
WITH COUNTY CELLS COUNTY

02:30:45.736 --> 02:30:47.104
SOMETIMES AS HAVE COUNTY

02:30:47.171 --> 02:30:50.107
PROPERTY IN OKAY. IT THAT THAT

02:30:50.174 --> 02:30:50.908
THAT HAS LAND USE OF SCARCE

02:30:50.975 --> 02:30:52.243
COUNTY LAND BUT THEN THERE'S

02:30:52.309 --> 02:30:54.011
THE CITIES AND THEN BUT YET.

02:30:54.078 --> 02:30:55.513
ALSO TO SOCIAL SERVICES AT

02:30:55.579 --> 02:30:58.082
LEAST AMPLE MENTAL HEALTH OF

02:30:58.149 --> 02:30:59.450
MEDICARE HOW. BASICALLY FOR

02:30:59.517 --> 02:31:01.419
SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH- BASICALLY

02:31:01.485 --> 02:31:03.687
DEPENDS ON COUNTY. BEHAVIOR

02:31:03.754 --> 02:31:05.856
HEALTH PLANS- THAT'S- THAT'S

02:31:05.923 --> 02:31:07.658
HOW WE IN FACT WE GIVE QUITE A

02:31:07.725 --> 02:31:09.226
BIT OF AUTONOMY TO COUNTIES IN

02:31:09.293 --> 02:31:11.562
TERMS OF. THE COUNTY HEALTH.

02:31:11.629 --> 02:31:14.932
BEHAVIOR HEALTH PLANS- SO HOW

02:31:14.999 --> 02:31:16.734
DO SOME TO AND SOMETIMES HAT

02:31:16.801 --> 02:31:17.668
TO DON'T COME TOGETHER AND I

02:31:17.735 --> 02:31:18.936
SPENT FORTY SEEN THIS IN MY OWN

02:31:19.003 --> 02:31:22.473

02:31:22.540 --> 02:31:23.441
GET BETTER COLLABORATION

02:31:23.507 --> 02:31:26.310
BETWEEN CITIES AND COUNTIES AND

02:31:26.377 --> 02:31:27.978
OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES IN TERMS

02:31:28.045 --> 02:31:30.281

OFTEN TIMES THE RESOURCES ARE

02:31:35.085 --> 02:31:36.754
DIRECTED TO COUNTIES. HOW DO WE

02:31:36.821 --> 02:31:38.956
GET BETTER LAND USE DECISIONS-

02:31:39.023 --> 02:31:41.192
THAT HELP US INCREASE HOUSING

02:31:41.258 --> 02:31:43.127

PANDEMIC. FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY

02:35:17.107 --> 02:35:19.910

02:36:53.570 --> 02:36:54.438
LET'S OPEN IT UP I'M WORKING

02:36:54.505 --> 02:36:55.472

THE CITY AND THE COUNTY ON

02:37:07.050 --> 02:37:08.685
DECISION MAKING IN FINDING. OUT

02:37:08.752 --> 02:37:11.288
WHICH- HAS HELPED STREAMLINE.

02:37:11.355 --> 02:37:13.257
BUT THAT'S THE TURN IT OVER TO-

02:37:13.323 --> 02:37:15.392
IS CRITICIZED. FROM TURNING

02:37:15.459 --> 02:37:17.528
POINT. WHAT CAN THE STATE DO TO

02:37:17.594 --> 02:37:20.197

OF THE WOODS WE HAD. A REALLY

02:37:25.702 --> 02:37:27.638
GOOD EXPERIENCE WHEN WE HAD

02:37:27.704 --> 02:37:30.574
FUNDS THAT WERE ALLOCATED TO.

02:37:30.641 --> 02:37:33.010
THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND I SAY

02:37:33.076 --> 02:37:35.412
THAT BECAUSE- BOTH THE COUNTIES

02:37:35.479 --> 02:37:37.881
AND THE CITY AND ACTIVELY

02:37:37.948 --> 02:37:39.683
PARTICIPATE IN THE CONTINUUM OF

02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:41.618

AT AT WHAT THE NEEDS WERE LOOK

02:37:46.089 --> 02:37:47.791
AT THE DATA AND BE ABLE TO

02:37:47.858 --> 02:37:50.060
DETERMINE WHAT. WHAT TYPES OF

02:37:50.127 --> 02:37:51.795
INTERVENTIONS WERE NEEDED AND

02:37:51.862 --> 02:37:54.131
THIS IS WITH KEEP AND CASH AS

02:37:54.198 --> 02:37:56.700
THOSE WERE. ZERO C. ALLOCATIONS

02:37:56.767 --> 02:37:58.335
WE'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT WHAT WAS

02:37:58.402 --> 02:38:00.704
NEEDED. AND THEN THE CITIES AND

02:38:00.771 --> 02:38:02.139
THE COUNTIES CAME TO THE C. O.

02:38:02.206 --> 02:38:04.408

02:38:04.474 --> 02:38:08.278
C. VOTED. ON IT. SO IT WAS. IT

02:38:08.345 --> 02:38:09.713
IT WHAT IT WAS LIKE A NATURAL

02:38:09.780 --> 02:38:11.949
COLLABORATION BECAUSE IT WAS A

02:38:12.015 --> 02:38:13.784
REQUIREMENT THAT THE COCS

02:38:13.851 --> 02:38:15.085
BATTED WHAT THE FUNDING WOULD

02:38:15.152 --> 02:38:17.621
BE USED FOR- AND THAT CAN BE

02:38:17.688 --> 02:38:19.423
DONE IN OTHER WAYS LIKE IF THE

02:38:19.489 --> 02:38:21.291
IF THE MONEY IS NOT ALLOCATED

02:38:21.358 --> 02:38:23.126
TO THE CEO SEEN. CITIES AND

02:38:23.193 --> 02:38:24.895
COUNTIES COULD BE REQUIRED WHEN

02:38:24.962 --> 02:38:26.697
THEY PUT IN APPLICATIONS TO GET

02:38:26.763 --> 02:38:28.031
A LETTER FROM THE CEO SEE

02:38:28.098 --> 02:38:29.600
VERIFYING THAT THEY DIDN'T RUN

02:38:29.666 --> 02:38:31.702
IT THROUGH. INTERNET RUN THEIR

02:38:31.768 --> 02:38:33.170
PLAN THROUGH THIS YEAR- STANDBY

02:38:33.237 --> 02:38:35.639
INPUT. BACK FROM THAT THE

02:38:35.706 --> 02:38:37.407
PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY

02:38:37.474 --> 02:38:39.710
PROVIDING THE SERVICES- AND

02:38:39.776 --> 02:38:41.278
ANOTHER MODEL THAT WORKS WELL

02:38:41.345 --> 02:38:43.013
IN JURISDICTIONS I THINK THAT

02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:44.815
WHERE THE CITY AND THE COUNTY.

02:38:44.882 --> 02:38:46.650
MAY NOT PLAY AS NICE TO GATHER

02:38:46.717 --> 02:38:49.219
IS ONE NON PROFITS ARE OFTEN

02:38:49.286 --> 02:38:51.355
ARE OPERATING THE PROGRAM THEN

02:38:51.421 --> 02:38:52.890
THEY HAVE THE PARTNERSHIPS TO

02:38:52.956 --> 02:38:55.459
MAKES THOSE. SERVICES

02:38:55.525 --> 02:38:58.629
ACCESSIBLE TO THE EIGHT

02:38:58.695 --> 02:39:00.731
RESIDENTS OUT OF ANY PROGRAM-

02:39:00.797 --> 02:39:02.232
AN EXAMPLE IS WITH OUR HOME HE

02:39:02.299 --> 02:39:04.434
FINDS WE- ARE HOUSING AUTHORITY

BOUGHT THE BUILDINGS TURNING

02:39:05.769 --> 02:39:06.970
POINT AS AN AGENCY THAT'S

FEEL LIKE THEY CONTINUE OF CARE

02:39:50.113 --> 02:39:53.984
STRUCTURE AND- I THINK THAT WE

02:39:54.051 --> 02:39:55.986
COULD WORK ON NOT STRUCTURE SO

02:39:56.053 --> 02:39:57.955
THAT ALL COUNTIES HAVE A GATE

02:39:58.021 --> 02:40:00.657

THAT. YOUR NEED SIR I'M SORRY.

02:42:45.589 --> 02:42:48.758

CONTINUUM OF CARE IS THAT A

02:42:51.027 --> 02:42:53.029
GOOD CONCEPT I WHO ONE OF OUR

02:42:53.096 --> 02:42:54.698
PROBLEMS HAS BEEN BIFURCATION

02:42:54.764 --> 02:42:57.567
OF FUNDING- IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS

02:42:57.634 --> 02:42:59.035
AND THEN BETWEEN THE CITY AND

02:42:59.102 --> 02:43:00.937
THE COUNTY AND I THINK THAT'S

02:43:01.004 --> 02:43:02.506
FUNDING A REGIONAL EFFORT THAT

02:43:02.572 --> 02:43:05.475
MIGHT INCLUDE CONTINUUM OF CARE

02:43:05.542 --> 02:43:06.877
IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA. WE

02:43:06.943 --> 02:43:08.145
WERE STRUGGLING WHEN WE'RE

02:43:08.211 --> 02:43:10.247
TRYING TO ESTABLISH CITY COUNTY.

02:43:10.313 --> 02:43:11.681
OPERATION BECAUSE OF THE

02:43:11.748 --> 02:43:14.784
BIFURCATION CARE MORE RECENTLY-

02:43:14.851 --> 02:43:16.386
THAT THE PROJECT ROOM KEY WE

02:43:16.453 --> 02:43:17.354
WERE WE WERE ABLE TO GET

02:43:17.420 --> 02:43:18.555
REIMBURSEMENT FROM ALMOST

02:43:18.622 --> 02:43:20.957
EVERYTHING WE DID INCLUDING-

02:43:21.024 --> 02:43:22.759
WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND BY

02:43:22.826 --> 02:43:24.794
COOPERATION THAT THAT THAT

02:43:24.861 --> 02:43:27.197
EXISTED I HAVE A STRONG PROGRAM

02:43:27.264 --> 02:43:29.032
BUT I THINK THE BIFURCATION OF

02:43:29.099 --> 02:43:30.567
FUNDING CURRENTLY- CAN BE A

02:43:30.634 --> 02:43:34.104
PROBLEM AND- IF THERE WAS A- A

02:43:34.171 --> 02:43:35.405
REGIONAL APPROACH TO FUNDING I

02:43:35.472 --> 02:43:37.307
THINK YOU SEE MORE RAD MORE OF

02:43:37.374 --> 02:43:39.276
A REGIONAL EFFORT. UP I'M NOT

02:43:39.342 --> 02:43:42.212
AWARE OF LASKO HAVING A ROLE

02:43:42.279 --> 02:43:43.180
THEY HAVEN'T HAD A ROLE IN OUR

02:43:43.246 --> 02:43:46.383
COUNTY- BUT- I THINK THE

02:43:46.449 --> 02:43:47.817
HOUSING AUTHORITIES AND SO

02:43:47.884 --> 02:43:50.720

02:43:52.155 --> 02:43:54.191
ROLES OF GOVERNMENT AND-

02:43:54.257 --> 02:43:55.559
WORKING TOGETHER TO TRY TO

02:43:55.625 --> 02:43:58.828
ACHIEVE A COMMON GOAL I DO

02:43:58.895 --> 02:44:01.765
UNDERSTAND- THE ISSUE OF- MAYBE

02:44:01.831 --> 02:44:03.633
HOUSING NOT BEING APPROVED.

02:44:03.700 --> 02:44:05.001
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL

02:44:05.068 --> 02:44:06.636
STRUGGLE WITH THAT KIND OF THE

02:44:06.703 --> 02:44:08.405
NBS OF THE CURRY SOMETIMES I

02:44:08.471 --> 02:44:10.607
THINK THAT'S- CHANGING SOMEWHAT

02:44:10.674 --> 02:44:15.345
BUT- IF WE DON'T BUILD HOUSING.

02:44:15.412 --> 02:44:15.979
WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE AFFORDABLE

02:44:16.046 --> 02:44:16.780

SPEAK TODAY. YOUR BACKGROUND

02:46:59.809 --> 02:47:01.144
OF THE CHALLENGES IN

02:47:01.211 --> 02:47:02.245

02:47:02.312 --> 02:47:04.147
QUANTIFICATION OF THE NUMBERS

02:47:04.948 --> 02:47:06.583
HOMELESSNESS. THERE IS AN

02:47:06.649 --> 02:47:07.917
ADDITIONAL LAYER FOR

02:47:07.984 --> 02:47:09.853
TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH AS THEY

02:47:09.919 --> 02:47:10.854
DO NOT FIT THE HOMELESS

02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:12.155
DEFINITION DEFINITION

02:47:12.222 --> 02:47:13.623

REMAIN INVISIBLE FOR SAFETY.

02:47:18.328 --> 02:47:19.863
THERE ARE VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS

02:47:19.929 --> 02:47:21.631
FOR TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH

02:47:21.698 --> 02:47:23.900
THEIR AGES AND STAGES DICTATE.

IN PROGRAMS AND I'M SURE THAT

02:47:30.373 --> 02:47:31.474
THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE EVER LIVED

02:47:31.541 --> 02:47:33.243

02:47:33.309 --> 02:47:35.078
KEENLY AWARE OF THE UNIQUE

02:47:35.145 --> 02:47:36.479
CHALLENGES THAT THEIR AGE GROUP

02:47:36.546 --> 02:47:38.248
PRESENTS IN TERMS OF EMOTIONAL

02:47:38.314 --> 02:47:40.049
AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT.

02:47:40.116 --> 02:47:44.421
THIS OCCURS IN COHABITATION IN

02:47:44.487 --> 02:47:45.922
CONJUNCTION AND IT'S

02:47:45.989 --> 02:47:47.624
EXACERBATED BY ADVERSE

02:47:47.690 --> 02:47:49.225
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES.

02:47:49.292 --> 02:47:52.028
GENERATIONAL TRAUMA AND POVERTY.

02:47:52.095 --> 02:47:54.364
THERE IS A REDUCED AVAILABILITY

02:47:54.431 --> 02:47:56.132
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH HAS

02:47:56.199 --> 02:47:57.167
BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED HERE

02:47:57.233 --> 02:47:59.202
TODAY BUT IT PUTS A DOWNWARD

02:47:59.269 --> 02:48:01.171
SQUEEZE ON THE LESS ADEPT AT

02:48:01.237 --> 02:48:02.605
NEGOTIATING THOSE COMPLEX

02:48:02.672 --> 02:48:04.641
SYSTEMS. TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH

02:48:04.707 --> 02:48:06.743
ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE CHOSEN AS

02:48:06.810 --> 02:48:07.977
A CANDIDATE FOR THOSE HOUSING

02:48:08.044 --> 02:48:09.412
PROGRAMS AS THEY HAVE LESS

02:48:09.479 --> 02:48:11.014
ESTABLISH CREDIT SHORTER

02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:12.949
EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND GREATER

02:48:13.016 --> 02:48:15.251
TRANSIENTS. IN SACRAMENTO WE

02:48:15.318 --> 02:48:17.654
HAVE FANTASTIC CHALLENGES AND

02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:19.656
WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE

02:48:19.722 --> 02:48:22.559
MANY DIVERSE PROGRAM PROGRAMS

02:48:22.625 --> 02:48:24.394
WHICH IS FANTASTIC BUT THERE

02:48:24.461 --> 02:48:25.962
ARE TOO FEW SPOTS IN THOSE

02:48:26.029 --> 02:48:27.664
INNOVATIONS WHICH IS REALLY NOT

02:48:27.730 --> 02:48:30.900
GOOD. THE TOTAL OF SPOTS IS NOT

02:48:30.967 --> 02:48:32.902
IS LESS THAN 25% OF THE

02:48:32.969 --> 02:48:34.370
IDENTIFIED YOUTH EXPERIENCING

02:48:34.437 --> 02:48:36.406
HOMELESSNESS FROM THE TWO

02:48:36.473 --> 02:48:37.040
THOUSAND NINETEEN POINT IN TIME

02:48:37.106 --> 02:48:39.943
COUNT. WHICH HAS POSTULATED TO

02:48:40.009 --> 02:48:41.978
HAVE BEEN AS MUCH AS A 75%

02:48:42.045 --> 02:48:43.580
UNDER COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF

02:48:43.646 --> 02:48:45.415
YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS

02:48:45.482 --> 02:48:46.416
DUE TO THE NATURE OF YOUTH

02:48:46.483 --> 02:48:48.017
HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS HIGHLY

02:48:48.084 --> 02:48:50.687
INVISIBLE. WE HAVE HAD AN

02:48:50.753 --> 02:48:51.988
INCREASE NEED FOR TRANSITIONAL

02:48:52.055 --> 02:48:54.390
HOUSING AS YOUTH IN THE SHELTER

02:48:54.457 --> 02:48:56.259
HAVE NO WHERE TO EXIT. WE

02:48:56.326 --> 02:48:58.294
RECEIVED USED INTO OUR SHELTER

02:48:58.361 --> 02:49:00.129
FROM OTHER SHELTERS AS MANY

02:49:00.196 --> 02:49:02.465
OTHER LOCAL PROBLEM PROGRAMS

02:49:02.532 --> 02:49:04.834
HAVE THE SAME EXIT CHALLENGES.

02:49:04.901 --> 02:49:06.469
AND WE BELIEVE THAT COATED

02:49:06.536 --> 02:49:08.104
STANDS TO EXACERBATE THIS IS

02:49:08.171 --> 02:49:09.939
CURRENTLY HOUSED FAMILIES ARE

02:49:10.006 --> 02:49:12.509
BECOMING UNSTABLE. TRANSITIONAL

02:49:12.575 --> 02:49:13.610
AGE YOUTH ARE VULNERABLE

02:49:13.676 --> 02:49:15.845
BECAUSE THEY'RE ADULTS AND SO

02:49:15.912 --> 02:49:17.113
FAMILIES PEELED OFF IN AN

02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:18.781
EFFORT TO STATE HOUSE

02:49:18.848 --> 02:49:20.049
PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY'RE

02:49:20.116 --> 02:49:21.484
COMBINING HOUSEHOLDS WITH OTHER

02:49:21.551 --> 02:49:23.887
UNSTABLE FOLKS. WE ALSO KNOW

02:49:23.953 --> 02:49:25.355
THAT FROM THE LAST RECESSION

02:49:25.421 --> 02:49:27.023
YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICULARLY

02:49:27.090 --> 02:49:30.059
AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LGBTQ

02:49:30.126 --> 02:49:31.961
YOUTH WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY

02:49:32.028 --> 02:49:33.930
DISADVANTAGED AND WE STAND TO

02:49:33.997 --> 02:49:36.232
REPEAT THIS RECENT HISTORY

02:49:36.299 --> 02:49:38.334
WITHOUT PROACTIVE ACTION. SO

02:49:38.401 --> 02:49:41.070
WHAT DO WE NEED. IN TWO

02:49:41.137 --> 02:49:41.538
THOUSAND NINETEEN USE

02:49:41.604 --> 02:49:42.505

02:49:42.572 --> 02:49:44.741
HIGHEST PRIORITY AFTER MORE

YOUTH HAVE MULTI FACETED NEEDS

02:50:09.265 --> 02:50:10.767
AND THAT'S WHY PROGRAMS HAVE TO

02:50:10.833 --> 02:50:12.068
BE CREATED AND DESIGNED

02:50:12.135 --> 02:50:14.103
SPECIFICALLY TO MEET THEM WHERE

02:50:14.170 --> 02:50:17.507
THEY ARE. THE DATA SUGGESTS

02:50:17.574 --> 02:50:19.576
THAT UPWARDS OF 50% OF PEOPLE

02:50:19.642 --> 02:50:21.077

02:51:47.764 --> 02:51:51.067
SO IN YOU VERY ABSOLUTELY HIT

02:51:51.134 --> 02:51:52.368
THE NAIL ON THE HEAD

02:51:52.435 --> 02:51:54.370
TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH DO NOT

02:51:54.437 --> 02:51:56.572
ACCESS PROJECT TWENTY THE

02:51:56.639 --> 02:51:58.741
BOTTOM LINE IS THOSE PROGRAMS

02:51:58.808 --> 02:52:00.543
ARE TYPICALLY ACCESSED THROUGH

02:52:00.610 --> 02:52:03.713
ADULT SHELTERS. AND ADULTS-

02:52:03.780 --> 02:52:07.350
OUTREACH YEP AND USE ARE NOT

02:52:07.417 --> 02:52:09.986
FOUND IN THOSE SPACES SO

02:52:10.053 --> 02:52:11.954
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE A

02:52:12.021 --> 02:52:13.756
NUMBER OF RESOURCES BEING

02:52:13.823 --> 02:52:15.725
ALLOCATED TOWARD THE MILLION

02:52:15.792 --> 02:52:18.094
RATIONS OF. THE HOMELESSNESS

02:52:18.161 --> 02:52:19.929
ISSUE BUT THAT DOES NOT TOUCH

02:52:19.996 --> 02:52:22.365
TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH AS

02:52:22.432 --> 02:52:23.099
THEY'RE NOT IN THOSE SPACES.

02:52:23.166 --> 02:52:24.467
YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S THE

02:52:24.534 --> 02:52:26.235
AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT

02:52:26.302 --> 02:52:27.570
WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH AND

02:52:27.637 --> 02:52:30.006
DIRECTOR BUT WHEN IT COMES TO

02:52:30.073 --> 02:52:31.007
THE CHALLENGES FACED BY

02:52:31.074 --> 02:52:32.709
TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH THE GAP

02:52:32.775 --> 02:52:34.377
NOW JUST GOTTEN WIDER BUT I

02:52:34.444 --> 02:52:35.411
DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR

02:52:35.478 --> 02:52:37.613
MOUTH SO. TALK TO US IN CORRECT

02:52:37.680 --> 02:52:40.650
ME IF I'M WRONG. SO THE REALITY

02:52:40.717 --> 02:52:43.820
IS THAT THE- PARTNERSHIPS THAT.

02:52:43.886 --> 02:52:45.321
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

02:52:45.388 --> 02:52:46.723
AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS

02:52:46.789 --> 02:52:48.591
THAT SERVE. THE POPULATION OF

02:52:48.658 --> 02:52:49.659
TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH AND

02:52:49.726 --> 02:52:51.661
PARTICULARLY LGBT YOUTH. THANK

02:52:51.728 --> 02:52:54.497
IN PARTICULAR- THAT ROLE CAN'T

02:52:54.564 --> 02:52:56.966
BE UNDERSTATED AND THERE ARE

02:52:57.033 --> 02:52:58.735
LOTS OF REALLY GREAT USES FOR

02:52:58.801 --> 02:53:00.036
GOVERNMENT AND LARGE PROGRAMS

02:53:00.103 --> 02:53:01.337
LIKE ONE BY CITIES AND

02:53:01.404 --> 02:53:03.306
COUNTIES. BUT THE REALITY IS

02:53:03.372 --> 02:53:04.607
THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND FOLKS

02:53:04.674 --> 02:53:06.375
THAT WORK WITH YOUTH. ON A DAY

02:53:06.442 --> 02:53:07.844
TO DAY BASIS ARE THE ABSOLUTE

02:53:07.910 --> 02:53:10.580
BEST STRATEGY FOR BEING ABLE

02:53:10.646 --> 02:53:12.949
TO. REDUCE AND ELIMINATE YOUTH

02:53:13.015 --> 02:53:14.450
HOMELESSNESS. AND GETTING

02:53:14.517 --> 02:53:16.252
RESOURCES INTO THE HANDS OF

02:53:16.319 --> 02:53:17.320
THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING

02:53:17.386 --> 02:53:18.788
THOSE PROGRAMS SHOULD BE A

02:53:18.855 --> 02:53:22.125
PRIORITY. AREAS HAS BEEN AN 88%

02:53:22.191 --> 02:53:24.093
SET ASIDE THAT WAS DESIGNATED.

02:53:24.160 --> 02:53:26.395
BY STATUTE FOR BOTH KEEP AND

02:53:26.462 --> 02:53:28.564
HAPPY. AND THAT IS COMPLETELY

02:53:28.631 --> 02:53:31.567
INSUFFICIENT TO BE ABLE TO-

02:53:31.634 --> 02:53:34.103
ADDRESS AND- NEGOTIATE. THE

02:53:34.170 --> 02:53:35.271
PROBLEM. I THINK THE OTHER

02:53:35.338 --> 02:53:37.640
PIECES HE SAID AT SO MANY OF

02:53:37.707 --> 02:53:39.776
THESE. YOUTHS ARE POTENTIALLY

02:53:39.842 --> 02:53:41.911
COMING OUT OF THE FOSTER SYSTEM

02:53:41.978 --> 02:53:44.180
HERE. IN CALIFORNIA IN THIS

02:53:44.247 --> 02:53:46.783
JUST BE CANDID- UNDERFUNDED AS

02:53:46.849 --> 02:53:49.285
WELL- ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES

02:53:49.352 --> 02:53:51.220
TO SERVICES AFTER THE AGE OUT

02:53:51.287 --> 02:53:53.256
OF THE SYSTEM. SO IN ADDITION

02:53:53.322 --> 02:53:55.491
TO HAVING TO TRY TO SECURE.

02:53:55.558 --> 02:53:59.362
SHELTER SHOULD SECURE- A ROOM.

02:53:59.428 --> 02:54:00.963
AT THE VERY MINIMUM. THEY'RE

02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:02.565
DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH

02:54:02.632 --> 02:54:03.900
CHALLENGES DETENTION CENTERS

02:54:03.966 --> 02:54:06.068
ABUSE. I MEAN IT'S- A LIFETIME

02:54:06.135 --> 02:54:07.403
OF CHALLENGES IF YOU WANT TO

02:54:07.470 --> 02:54:11.607
COMMENT ON. THAT AND THEN WE'LL

02:54:11.674 --> 02:54:12.175
GO TO SENATOR WIENER. I'D BE

02:54:12.241 --> 02:54:13.776
HAPPY TO. THE RIYADH IS THAT

02:54:13.843 --> 02:54:15.611
OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM DOES THE

02:54:15.678 --> 02:54:16.813
VERY BEST YOU CAN WITH THE

02:54:16.879 --> 02:54:19.081
RESOURCES THAT IT HAS AVAILABLE

02:54:19.148 --> 02:54:21.350
BUT IT'S A POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR-

02:54:21.417 --> 02:54:24.754
NATURAL AND- ORGANIC FAMILIES.

02:54:24.821 --> 02:54:26.722
AND ANYONE OF US IS RAISED A

02:54:26.789 --> 02:54:29.659
CHILD KNOWS THAT THE COST IS

02:54:29.725 --> 02:54:31.427
NOT JUST FINANCIAL THERE'S ALSO

02:54:31.494 --> 02:54:33.329
ALMOST ON PSYCHOLOGICAL COSTS

02:54:33.396 --> 02:54:34.831
FOR RAISING A CHILD AND IF

02:54:34.897 --> 02:54:36.232
THERE AREN'T FOLKS AROUND TO BE

02:54:36.299 --> 02:54:37.800
ABLE TO POUR INTO THE YOUNG

02:54:37.867 --> 02:54:39.168
PEOPLE. WHO ARE LIVING IN THEIR

02:54:39.235 --> 02:54:41.037
HOMES OR THOSE HOUSES ARE

02:54:41.103 --> 02:54:42.672
DYSFUNCTIONAL IT ONLY

02:54:42.738 --> 02:54:45.241
EXACERBATES THE PROBLEMS. THAT

02:54:45.308 --> 02:54:47.310
ARE EXPERIENCED BY TEENAGERS

02:54:47.376 --> 02:54:49.312
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST GOING

02:54:49.378 --> 02:54:50.112
THROUGH THE NORMAL

02:54:50.179 --> 02:54:51.380
PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTAL

02:54:51.447 --> 02:54:53.549
CHALLENGES OF BEING A YOUNG

02:54:53.616 --> 02:54:56.619
PERSON- THE RESOURCES THAT ARE

02:54:56.686 --> 02:54:59.488
NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO TRANSITION

02:54:59.555 --> 02:55:01.591
A YOUNG PERSON FROM BEING.

02:55:01.657 --> 02:55:04.827
FULLY CARED FOR IN A HOME TO. I

02:55:04.894 --> 02:55:06.696
CALL IT LAUNCHING INTO

02:55:06.762 --> 02:55:09.832
ADULTHOOD ARE TREMENDOUS AND

02:55:09.899 --> 02:55:12.168
ALMOST NOT QUANTIFIABLE IF

02:55:12.235 --> 02:55:13.536
YOU'RE ADDING A DOLLAR FIGURE

02:55:13.603 --> 02:55:16.472
TO IT SO THERE IS A DEEP NEED

02:55:16.539 --> 02:55:17.673
FOR QUALITY PROGRAM

02:55:17.740 --> 02:55:19.675
DEVELOPMENTS. THAT ADDRESSES

02:55:19.742 --> 02:55:22.211
ALL OF THE ASPECTS OF LAUNCHING

02:55:22.278 --> 02:55:24.847
AND MOST OF OUR FOSTER CARE

02:55:24.914 --> 02:55:26.382
PROGRAMS DON'T HAVE THE

02:55:26.449 --> 02:55:28.017
RESOURCES AND OR THE BAND WITH

02:55:28.084 --> 02:55:29.652
TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THAT KIND

02:55:29.719 --> 02:55:31.454
OF COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMMING.

02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:33.522
ALSO NGUYEN YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

02:55:33.589 --> 02:55:35.324
MOVING INTO OTHER SYSTEMS LIKE

02:55:35.391 --> 02:55:37.159
HIGHER EDUCATION THERE IS AN

02:55:37.226 --> 02:55:38.494
EXPECTATION THAT THOSE SYSTEMS

02:55:38.561 --> 02:55:40.663
ARE INTACT AND FOLKS GO INTO

02:55:40.730 --> 02:55:43.065
HIGHER ED AND HEAD OFF TO THE

02:55:43.132 --> 02:55:44.200
COLLEGE OF THEIR CHOICE AND

02:55:44.267 --> 02:55:45.568
THEN THERE'S NOT HOUSING THERE.

02:55:45.635 --> 02:55:47.403
FOR THEM TO GO TO THAT AND THEN

02:55:47.470 --> 02:55:48.838
ADDS AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF

02:55:48.905 --> 02:55:50.740
STRESS AND THAT AND YOU CAN'T

02:55:50.806 --> 02:55:52.108
FIND HOUSING WHERE YOU'VE

02:55:52.174 --> 02:55:54.610
DECIDED O GO TO COLLEGE. SO

02:55:54.677 --> 02:55:56.412
HIGHER ED HAS THAT CHALLENGES

02:55:56.479 --> 02:55:58.648
WELL IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

02:55:58.714 --> 02:56:00.716
SUPPORTING. INSTITUTIONS OF
