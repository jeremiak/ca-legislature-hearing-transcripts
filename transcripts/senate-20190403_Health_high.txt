WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A QUORUM SO WE ARE GOING TO START AS A SUB COMMITTEE -- SO WE JUST WANNA MAKE NOTE WE HAVE THIRTEEN ITEMS ON OUR AGENDA. AND ACTUALLY CERTAIN CENTER PORTANTINO LOOKS LIKE POINT TO COME UP BUT I'M GONNA DO MY INTRO FIRST IF YOU WISH TO BRING YOU THE COME UP WITH YOUR OF WITNESSES. ITEM NUMBER TEN HAS THAT IS BEING HELD OVER SO WE'RE NOT HEARING ITEM NUMBER TEN SB -- FIVE THIRTY NINE TODAY THERE ARE NO ITEMS ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. AND SO -- WITH THAT AND WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD BEGIN AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND WE'RE GONNA BEGIN FIRST WITH THAT WE DO TAKE THINGS AND FOLLOW ORDER BUT WE ALSO HERE -- MEMBERS ARE NOW THE COMMITTEE FIRST SUFFOCATION PEOPLE ARE FOLLOWING ALONG SO WE CAN BEGIN WITH ITEM NUMBER TWO SP ONE SIXTY THREE BUT CENTER PORTANTINO. WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- SENATE BILL ONE SIXTY THREE WILL ELIMINATE SIGNIFICANT ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS IMPOSED BY HEALTH PLANS THAT ARE PREVENTING FAMILIES FROM ACCESSING. BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENT FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM. RESEARCH HAS CLEARLY SHOWN THE CHILDREN WITH ASD WHO RECEIVE BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENT EARLY CAN SHOW REMARKABLE PROGRESS -- THE BILL ALSO CODIFIES REQUIREMENTS FOR A QUALIFIED AUTISM SERVICE PROFESSIONAL AND PARA PROFESSIONAL. TO INSURE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE -- STATISTICALLY TELL US. STATISTICS TELL US THAT ONE IN SIXTY EIGHT CHILDREN BORN TODAY ARE DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM. EARLY INTERVENTION IS THE KEY TO HELPING THESE CHILDREN LIVE UP TO THEIR POTENTIAL AND HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT IS CRITICAL TO THAT HEALTH OF THE CHILD. THE SAME. ARE THEY RESPOND TO TREATMENT DIFFERENTLY CHILDREN NEED TREATMENT TAILORED TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PHYSICIANS OR PSYCHOLOGIST WHO KNOWS THEM BEST NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL TREATMENT. THAT MAY OR MAY NOT FIT SO EIGHT YEARS AGO SB NINE FORTY SIX PASSED THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM. IT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS BUT MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN PREVENTED FROM RECEIVING THE BENEFITS BECAUSE OF A DRAFTING ERROR -- AN ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS NOT EVERY CHILD IS RECEIVING COVERAGE FOR THE TREATMENT THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER PRESCRIBES THEM. THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING DENIED COVERAGE FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBED EVIDENCE BASED CARE. THIS COVERAGE THEY OR THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR BUT IN TOO MANY CASES THE PARENTS OR THE STATE ARE LEFT TO COVER THE COSTS OF THIS CRITICAL CARE. ADDITIONALLY FOR MANY CHILDREN THERE IS A SIX TO TWELVE MONTH WAITING LIST FOR THE ONE TREATMENT THAT HEALTH INSURANCES COVER. TREATMENT DELAYED HIS TREATMENT DENIED IN A DEVELOPING MIND BY EXPANDING THE TYPES OF QUALIFIED ALREADY STATE CERTIFIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ELIGIBLE FOR COVERAGE. THIS BILL WILL BOTH ADDRESS THE CRITICAL SHORTAGE AND ALLOW CHILDREN TO RECEIVE TREATMENT THEIR PHYSICIANS HAVE PRESCRIBED. THE BILL ALSO WOULD DRESS ROADBLOCKS TO COVERAGE FOR PARENTS WHO FOR REASONS OF WORK OR FAMILY PRESSURE CAN NOT FULLY PARTICIPATE. IN THEIR CHILD'S THERAPY SESSION -- OR WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE TO RECEIVE SERVICES AT SCHOOL OR DAYCARE THE SITUATION SHOULD NOT PRECLUDE COVERAGE FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT. AND WITH SP ONE SIXTY THREE THEY WON'T -- IT ALSO SEEKS TO CORRECT THE DRAFTING ERROR IN NINE FORTY SIX TO MAKE SURE EVERY PERSON WITH AUTISM HAS HEALTH COVERAGE FOR THEIR MEDICALLY PRESCRIBED TREATMENT THE BILL HAS BROAD SUPPORT ACROSS THE STATE. WE RECEIVED OVER TWO HUNDRED LETTERS FROM PARENTS IN SUPPORT AND NUMEROUS AUTISM ORGANIZATIONS AND PROFESSIONALS IN ADDITION THE BILL IS CO SPONSORED BY THE D. I. R. FOR TIME COALITION OF CALIFORNIA AND INTER. COUNCIL OF DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING THE SPONSORS REPRESENT THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS CHILDREN WITH AUTISM THEIR PARENTS AND THEIR TREATMENT PROVIDERS I HAVE HERE. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT JIM LANDRY FROM THE COALITION -- AND OF CALIFORNIA AND CAITLIN WELSH A PARENT OF A SON WITH AUTISM AND THIS BILL PASSED THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR AND I KNOW THE CHAIR IS VERY FAMILIAR AND WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH. WITH MY STAFF TO GET IT AGAIN IN A GOOD POSITION I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO AND APPRECIATE YOU WORKING A STEP TO STEP BEFORE WE TAKE A WITNESSES JUST TO CLARIFY BECAUSE IT'S NOT NAY ANALYSIS THE AMENDMENT THAT YOU ACCEPTED WAS SIMPLY TO REMOVE. A HALF AND IT DID THAT DEFINITION OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE THAT IT IN IN THE NEW SECTION OF CODE I STILL EXIST IN THE IN ITS CURRENT SECTION OF CODE RIGHT. OKAY TWENTY CLEAR ON THAT OKAY. AND SO FOR WITNESSES -- JUST -- REMINDED THE WE ALLOW SIX MINUTES -- OF YOU GUYS YOU CAN. DECIDE HOW YOU DOING THIS TO BE BETWEEN THE TWO DO SO I ALWAYS REMIND THE PEOPLE SPEAK FIRST REMEMBER THE PEOPLE FOLLOWING.

THANK YOU PAN. I'M HERE STONE. STONE HERE DRAWS SO. GROWTH HER TADO. HER TITLE HERE LEYVA LEYVA HERE MITCHELL. MITCHELL'S HERE MONNING RUBIO. OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU SORRY FOR ALL THE BILL HAYES THANK YOU THAT'S QUITE ALRIGHT -- DOCTOR VAN HAS CENTERS -- MY NAME IS JIM LANDRY I REPRESENT THE DR FLOOR TIME COALITION OF CALIFORNIA -- THIS IS ACTUALLY THE CULMINATION OF TWENTY YEARS OF WORK THE LEGISLATURE -- ORIGINALLY ADOPTED -- THE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WHICH SAID THAT THE HEALTH INSURANCE NEEDED TO COVER AUTISM AS WELL AS OTHER MENTAL. HEALTH -- CONDITIONS IN THE SAME MANNER AS PHYSICAL AILMENTS. A HIGH AND TO SOME EXTENT -- THAT WAS DONE UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS NOT DONE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR REASONS THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES -- CLAIMED IT WAS EDUCATIONAL IT WAS EXPERIMENTAL AND WHATNOT NEW NEWS TOOK -- SEVERAL -- LAWSUITS HAND -- TO FINALLY GET THEM TO BEGIN TO COVER IT -- UNTIL -- SENATOR STEINBERG PASSED SENATE BILL NINE FORTY SIX EIGHT YEARS AGO -- SO SENATE BILL NINE FORTY SIX WAS PASSED AND UNFORTUNATELY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES LOOK TO BEND SAID OKAY WE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING NOW -- BUT WHAT YOU REALLY MEANT WAS THIS AND IT. WAS NOT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE MEANT -- AS THE CENTER PORTANTINO MENTIONED THERE WERE SOME DRAFTING ERRORS AND EVEN THOUGH THE BILL CLEARLY SAID IT WAS SUPPOSED TO COVER ALL PHYSICIAN AND PSYCHOLOGIST PRESCRIBED EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT -- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT -- THAT WAS NOT THE CASE AND SO WE'RE BACK AGAIN HOPEFULLY IT THE CULMINATION OF THISTWENTY YEAR EFFORT TO FINALLY ACHIEVE THE NECESSARY COVERAGE THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE ASKED. FOR THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS DEMANDED THAT WE COVER EVIDENCE BASED PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBED MEDICALLY NECESSARY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM -- THAT THEY HAVE PAID FOR AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL FINALLY COVER THAT LOOP AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK CAITLYN WILSHIRE MOTHER OF A YOUNG MAN WITH AUTISM. WHO HAS A EXPERIENCED THIS? TO TELL ABOUT HER SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES. THANK YOU. MY SON IS TEN HIS NAME IS SPENCER AT TWO HE BECAME VERY AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS ASSN OTHERS AND KAISER -- BASICALLY SAID HE WAS VIOLENT. WHEN HE WENT TO PRESCHOOL IT WAS AN ISSUE? AND THEY RECOMMENDED WE SEE A CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST OUTSIDE OF KAISER WITHIN THE FIRST SESSION HIS HOUR AND A HALF RAGES WHERE WE HAD TO RESTRAIN HIM WENT DOWN TO ADD AND THAT WAS EVERY DAY. WENT ON TO TWENTY MINUTE RAGES EVERY OTHER DAY AFTER THE SECOND SESSION IT WAS ONCE A WEEK. AND AFTER THAT WE NEVER HAD TO RESTRAIN HIM AGAIN. IT WAS THAT EFFECTIVE IT WAS THEN HE WAS OUT -- DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM AND SHE LET US KNOW THAT WHAT SHE WAS DOING WAS D. I. R. FLOOR TIME. AND BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WASN'T ABA AND SO WE'VE BEEN GETTING FIVE AND A HALF YEARS OF DIR THROUGH REGIONAL CENTER. IT'S BEEN AMAZING AND HE WAS DOING REALLY WELL AND WE DID A FADE OUT BUT THERE'S STILL SOME ISSUES HIS ARTISTIC. SO I WENT TO KAISER AND I SAID WE AND THE DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN SAID. HE REALLY NEEDS TO CONTINUE THIS THERAPY IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR HIM AND SHE RECOMMENDED DIR AND THEY WE WERE ASKING FOR FOUR HOURS A MONTH. AND THEY DENIED IT WHAT THEY SAID YOU CAN DO ABA. AND SO NOW WE GET FORTY HOURS A MONTH OF ABA AND IT'S KIND OF A DISASTER FOR MY KID. HE'S NOW HAVING TEMPER TANTRUMS AND RAGES RAN OUT THE DOOR AND DOWN THE BLOCK HIDING UNDER BOXES. AND THROWING THINGS AT WAL SO WE'RE NOW IN A SITUATION YOU KNOW MAY BE DIFFERENT KIDS NEED DIFFERENT TYPE OF THERAPY I KNOW ABA WORKS WITH A LOT OF KIDS BUT IT DOESN'T WORK WITH OURS. AND IT'S HARD THAT MY DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE THE RECOMMENDATION FOR MY SON AND IT WAS NOT ACCEPTED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY. THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] ACT MICROPHONE. OPERATES LIKE A LOT OF ASIAN. ALL EYES ARE ON ACTUALLY. THANK YOU PLEASE REPEAT SORRY REPEAT FOR THE RECORD. GOOD AFTERNOON AMANDA LEVY WITH THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ARE SEEN OTHER WITNESSES AT THE MICROPHONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION -- COME UP TO THE TABLE. COME UP WITH A LOOK AT HIM I THINK WE HAVE. THREE CHAIRS THERE WE HAVE THREE ALL RIGHT. AND AGAIN I REMIND YOU SIX MINUTES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO THE BETWEEN THE THREE OF YOU UNTIL. ARE A GOOD. DON'T LEAVE THE LAST ONE AM. THANK YOU -- FOR HAPPINESS AND I AM -- BOARDS AT MY NAME'S MICHELLE HEIGHT AND I'M A BOARD CERTIFIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSTS AND I'M THE VICE CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS. AND WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR QUALIFIED ARTISAN SERVICE PROFESSIONALS IMPAIR PROFESSIONALS. AND RESPECTFULLY JUST. WISH THAT YOU WOULD VOTE NO AND THAT WE WOULD HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH AUTHOR ON THE BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JENNIFER ALI WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS REVEREND REPRESENTING. FORTY FIVE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS THAT COLLECTIVELY PROVIDE.% HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TWENTY TO MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT INCLUDES THOSE WITH AUTISM. I'M CAPS MEMBERS CURRENTLY PROVIDE MEDICAL COMPLY BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS SERVICES TO THEIR ENROLLEES WITH -- AUTISM -- SB NINE FORTY SIX IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN MOVED AUTISM COVERAGE OUT OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE REQUIRED HEALTH PLANS TO CUT COVER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THERAPY. FOR PEOPLE WITH AUTISM -- AND OUR EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE NET NETWORKS OF AUTISM SERVICE PROVIDERS -- AND SINCE THAT TIME AUTISM -- SERVICES ARE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. ON THIS BILL INCLUDES AN EXTENSIVE PROVISIONS ABOUT THE CRITERIA FOR PROP PROFESSIONALS AND CARE PROFESSIONALS. WHO MAY PROVIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THERAPY IT'S IMPORTANT REMEMBER THAT THESE PROVISIONS OF LAW? IN THIS BILL AMEND THAT THE HEALTH INSURANCE. MANDATE PROVISIONS AND DON'T NECESSARILY INTEND TO DRESS PROVIDER INDUSTRY STANDARDS -- THE SB NINE FORTY SIX TASK FORCE ACTUALLY RECOMMENDED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROFESSIONAL LICENSE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS WHICH MAY BE MORE APPROPRIATE MECHANISM FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING SUCH STANDARDS. OR OPPOSITION IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT IT MAY DILUTE THE QUALITY OF CARE CURRENTLY RECEIVE BYRON RELEASE. GENERALLY SPEAKING HEALTH PLANS CONTRACTORS LICENSED PROFESSIONALS. TO ENSURE THAT SERVICES PROVIDED TO THEIR BELIEFS ARE ROOTED IN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE. SHEET IN REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE TO REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE SCOPE OF PROVIDER CHANGES CONTAINED IN THIS BILL. HEALTH PLAN COVERAGE DECISIONS ARE ROOTED IN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE. AND MEDICINE INTO STUDIES ONE WITH THE SAMPLE SIZE OF TWENTY TWO OR INSUFFICIENT FROM HEALTH PLANS PERSPECTIVE TO BECOME EVIDENCE BASED. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE NATIONAL AUTISM CENTER CAN BE TO PANEL RESEARCHERS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BERRIES BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES TO ADDRESS AUTISM RELATED CONDITIONS. THE REPORT INCLUDED A LIST OF THIRTEEN AND STAMP UNESTABLISHED INTERVENTIONS FOR CHILDREN. AND INCLUDED T. R. OR FLOOR TIME. AS AN UNPROVEN MODALITY -- SO I JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE HEARING MULTIPLE MULTIPLE BILLS THIS YEAR THAT WILL HAVE A SMALL RELATIVE LARGE IMPACTS ON HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM COSTS. THIS BILL IS ONE OF SIX SENATE BILLS THAT WILL BE CONSIDERED. FOR MANY POLICY ARGUMENTS CAN BE MADE TO WITHOUT SOME OF THESE BILLS WE WOULD URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT ON THESE BILLS. AND THE TRADE OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASING HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS -- TO THE CONTEXT THAT SOME OF THEM. IT'S ADDING TO THE HIGHER COST OF HEALTH CARE. STEPHANIE WHAT CAN SOMEBODY HAVE THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THEM AT THAT THE COMMITTEE WENT FORWARD. REGARDING EVIDENCE BASED UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL I THINK IN GENERAL WE HAVE A BIT OF A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE CHARACTER ASIAN CHARACTERIZATION THAT AND SB NINE FORTY SIX THAT IT WAS A DRAFTING ERROR. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE -- WE'VE ALWAYS LOOKED AT FLOOR TIME IS POTENTIALLY NOT EVIDENCE BASED NOTHING FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO OUR ENROLLEES IN THE PRODUCTS THAT WE PROVIDE THAT. WE ENSURE THAT THE WHAT WE OFFER IS EVIDENCE BASED IN IS QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND I THINK -- IF THIS BILL BIT DOES MOVE FORWARD TODAY I THINK WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO POTENTIALLY HAVING ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS WERE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT. POTENTIALLY REMOVING -- THE PARENT FROM THE PROCESS WE THINK THAT THE KEY ELEMENTS -- WITH RESPECT TO MAKING SURE THAT SUCCESS OF THE CHILD AND THE FAMILY UNITS -- SO FOR THOSE REASONS REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR AND STAFF AS IF THE BILL DOES MOVE FOR TODAY. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION BACK BACK FROM NAME ORGANIZATION DOES ON LINGER ON BEHALF OF AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS OF CAPITA CLICK THANKS THANK YOU. KAREN SARKISIAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION. SYDNEY JACKSON FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE A POSITION OF CONCERNS -- THAT WE HAVE STARTED WORKING WITH THE AUTHORED SPONSOR TO ADDRESS THAT OUR MAIN ISSUE IS THAT THE BILL DOES NOT INSURE SOME FORM OF PARENT PARTICIPATION BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE MEMBERS OFFICE OKAY THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH. OKAY BEFORE YOU BRING IT TO YOU -- MEMBERS FOR SO I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS A MANDATE BILLET HATCH BERMAN ALICE'S OR SOMEONE FROM TO PURPOSE HERE. IF -- ACTUALLY IF YOU CAN ASK YOU TO JOIN US AT THE TABLE WE MAY HAVE THERE MAY BE SOME QUESTIONS THAT COME UP THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO HELP ELIMINATE -- FROM YOUR ANALYSIS SO I'VE THREE SHE YOU BEING HERE AND BEING WILLING TO THE STATE THIS CONVERSATION -- I WOULD MAKE NOTE -- THAT -- AGAIN YEAH CENTER PORTANTINO JUST ONE MENTION I'M JUST SAYING THIS BECAUSE YOUR BILL HAPPEN TO BE THE FIRST ONE UP FOR THAT RELATES TO A TO A MANDATE -- I I'D DO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE SEVERAL MANDATE BILLS WE ALSO HAVE -- BILLS TO REQUIRE PEOPLE GET HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE SO WE ARE VERY CONSCIOUS OF OF THIS -- I AWESOME CONSCIOUS THAT -- WE WILL BE SURE HEALTH INSURANCE IS THERE WHEN PEOPLE NEED IT SO -- AND SO YOU KNOW HAVING COVERAGE THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY COVER WHAT YOU NEED IS ALSO AN ISSUE TOO BUT VERY MUCH ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT WE WANT TO TRY -- TO NOT OVER BURDENING PEOPLE WERE GUY ASKED TO BE COVERED -- DO THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AN ANALYSIS -- THAT'S WHAT WE DO TO RIP AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED TO PROVE TO BE AT THE TABLE TO ENSURE THAT MAY COME UP AND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT MAY COME UP. SO WITH THAT CAVEAT I SAW THROUGHOUT THEIR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS CENTER STEP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR FOR MISS ALLI THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FREE SHOOTER TESTIMONY -- AT IN MY LITERATURE -- MY STAFF REPORTED SHOWS A FOR MENTALITIES BASED ON DEVELOPMENTAL THEORY D. S. P. -- THAT THERE IS A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE THE D. I. R. FOR TIME IMPROVES COMMUNICATION ENGAGEMENT. AND RELATIONSHIPS. UNDERSTANDING THAT. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. CAN. I HAVE A SON MY FIRST BORN GRAND CHILD IS SIX YEARS OLD. A NON VERBAL -- THERE ARE SOME SERVICES THAT ARE COVERED BY HIS INSURANCE. AND THERE ARE MANY SERVICES LIKE THIS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. AND IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE IF YOU HAVE AN AUTISTIC CHILD AND YOU NEED TO GET THEM THE HELP THAT THEY NEED HE SPENDING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS -- OUT OF HIS POCKET. TO TO A CANNY SEEING SOME PROGRESS. WITH -- THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS -- YOU KNOW WHAT WITH THAT WITH THE SHORTAGE OF A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. IS SOME TREATMENT BETTER THAN NO TREATMENT AT ALL BECAUSE THESE KIDS THESE MILLENNIALS Là CAN'T AFFORD -- TO PAY FOR A LOT OF THESE SERVICES ON THEIR OWN. AND THEN YOU KNOW HOW WOULD YOU RECOMMEND I ANSWER MY SON WHEN HE SAYS TO ME TONIGHT THAT -- WHY DIDN'T YOU HELP ME TO ALLOW FOR SOME OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE BANKRUPTING US? TO GET YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER THE SERVICES SHE NEEDS OF THE GOD WILLING SHE SPEAKS ONE DAY SHE'S INTELLIGENT. BUT SHE DOES HAVE NO VERBAL SKILLS ON ALL. SIDES WHEN IF YOU KIND OF ANGELES QUESTIONS FOR ME TO FURTHER THE THE PROVIDER HERE THAT WE HAVE TODAY BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PLANTS HAVE AN INTERNAL ROBUST -- PROCEDURE TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY. OF THE AFFECTED NYSSA VARIOUS TREATMENT AND THAT INCLUDES FOR ALL DISEASE GROUPS WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW A MEDICATION A PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION -- PHONE CALL SHE TYPE OF TREATMENT IN AND SO THEY HAVE THESE COMMITTEES THAT REVIEW ALL OF THE AVAILABLE -- MEDICAL EVIDENCE AND TO THEIR ANALYSIS FLOOR TIME CONTINUES NOT JUST DOESN'T HAVE. THE SAME AMOUNT OF RESEARCH AND STUDIES AVAILABLE THAT DO EXIST FOR APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS -- YOU KNOW THERE'S THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AUTISM CENTER CONVENED INTO THEIR REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE. TO BURP ALSO REVIEW THE XISTING LITERATURE AND IN IN THEIR REPORT IT IT. IN A YOU KNOW HE CAN PROBABLY SPEAK TO THIS BETTER THERE WERE TO STUDIES THAT SHOWED THAT FLOOR TIME -- WERE EFFECTIVE THAT WERE CITED IN IN THAT. THE TROOPER BUT ALSO IS BUT ONE OF THEM ONLY HAD A A SAMPLE SIZE OF TWENTY TWO PATIENTS IN SO THAT'S A VERY SMALL AND SO WE TALK ABOUT THE VOLUME OF EVIDENCE BEING AVAILABLE. TO KIND OF OUTLINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A CERTAIN TYPE OF TREATMENT UNFORTUNATELY FOR FLOOR TIME IT'S JUST NOT THERE. YOU KNOW WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE EVIDENCE TO BASE OUR COVERAGE DECISIONS ON THE WE RELY ON OKAY SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE COMPETING -- THEORIES AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS THE FACT OVER NOT OUT I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO HELP MY GRANDDAUGHTER OUT. WHEN I'M GOING TO DO PROBABLY TODAY IS ON A LAY OUT THIS BILL I WOULD LOVE TO TALK WITH YOU MORE AND I WANT TO TALK TO THE PROPONENTS MORE -- BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE MANY -- KIDS LIKE MY MY GRAND CHILD OUT THERE THAT ARE -- NOT GETTING SERVICES BECAUSE ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE AND THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE SERVICES BECAUSE BEEN AS YOUNG KIDS JUST CAN'T AFFORD THE COSTS -- AND MY SON STRUGGLES THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVERY SINGLE MONTH THE TO GIVE HOPE FOR HIS. FIRST BORN. THAT SHE COULD LEAD OF A WONDERFUL PRODUCTIVE LIFE SO -- MAYBE WE CAN GET TOGETHER LIKE TO LEARN MORE FROM YOU AND I'M A LEARN MORE FROM THE PROPONENTS IN THE BUT I PREACHY -- MY COLLEAGUE FOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND TRYING TO HELP THESE FAMILIES OUT THAT ARE THAT ARE. DOING THEIR BEST TO TRY TO HELP HER AUTISTIC CHILDREN WHEN YOU MENTION THE RATIO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF KIDS. YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE SKEPTICS OUT THERE THAT WOULD SAY THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T WANT TO ALLOW THESE PROFESSIONALS IN THEIR WHY BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO INCREASE THE COST. US SIGNIFICANTLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE RATIO OF KIDS ARE BEING BORN TODAY WITH AUTISM BUT YOU KNOW -- THEY DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE ANY OTHER DISEASE AND AND I'M IN GERMANY IN MY POWER TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. AND AGAIN I THINK THE AUTHOR BRING FORWARD. AND OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF GETTING. SO LET ME -- SO. ACTUALLY ME POSE A QUESTION FROM SUBURBAN HERE AND THEN MAYBE I ALSO SENT HER TINO ASK YOU. TO RESPOND TO THE SENATOR'S COMMENTS IF I MAY. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL PLEASE PLEASE IT WHEN WE GO HEAD TO THE WE JUST WANT TO GO AHEAD RESPOND FIRST THE CENTER STONE IF THAT'S ALRIGHT AND THEN -- WILL FALL TO MY QUESTION YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YET SENATOR I I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT. PATH TO MAKING DECISION ON THIS. AND YOU HAVE IN ESSENTIALLY A MONOPOLY. AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF FAMILIES STRUGGLING WITH CHILDREN WITH AUTISM. AND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THOSE FAMILIES ARE FINDING THAT THE ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT. IS EFFECTIVE IF THEY DIDN'T. TAKE THE FIRST TREATMENT WASN'T THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO THE SECOND TREATMENT. AND THE WAY WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE AN ARBITER IN THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A MONOPOLY YOU'RE GONNA SAY WERE BETTER THAN THE OTHER ONE AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A MONOPOLY. IS WERE IN POWER IN THE PHYSICIAN. TO MAKE THAT DECISION. THIS IS DOCTORPRESCRIBED MEDICALLY NECESSARY. EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT. AND SO. WE'RE TRYING TO HELP OUT THE FAMILY THAT YOU DESCRIBE. BY SAYING IF THEY'RE FOR PHYSICIAN THINKS THAT CHILD IS GOING TO BENEFIT FROM FOR TIME. THAT THE INSURER SHOULD COVER IT AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S OPPOSITION BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO COVER IT. BY AND WE WANT TO HELP THAT KID JUST LIKE YOU WANNA HELP THAT I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE AND VERY PROTECTIVE OF THE PHYSICIAN PATIENT. RELATIONSHIP. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT A LOT OF THE SERVICES THAT MY SON IS UNDERTAKING FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER. ARE BASED ON THE ORDERS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PHYSICIAN AND THAT'S EXACTLY -- TRYING TO DO HERE I WAS ON THE FENCE AND YOU PUSH ME ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FENCE AND SO. YOU KNOW I'M GONNA I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY IN A AND I WANT TO THE STILL ONE OF THE UP PLEASE THANK YOU. I STILL WANT TO MEET WITH THE OPPONENTS -- AND RESERVE MY RIGHT TO CHANGE MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR BUT LET ME TELL YA. IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN AUTISTIC CHILD IN YOUR FAMILY IN C.. THE THE CHALLENGES. OF THE THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE HUSBANDS OF MY WIFE'S AND WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD -- YOU KNOW WE ALL WANT A BETTER LIFE FOR OUR CHILDREN OUR GRANDCHILDREN WE HAVE FOR OURSELVES AND WE DIDN'T HAVE SOMETHING CALLED AUTISM LEASE. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP WE DIDN'T CALL IT AUTISM NOR DO I? RECOGNIZE THE SYMPTOMS OF WHAT I SEE TODAY BACKGROUND -- BUT LET ME TELL YOU IT'S LIFE CHANGING LIKE CHANGING I WOULD GIVE EVERYTHING I HAVE. SO THAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER -- COULD HAVE A A A GOOD LIFE A FAIR LIFE -- A LIFE WITH THE FEAR BEGINNING TO COMPETE IN THE WORLD AND SO -- CENTER PORTANTINO WHO I RESPECT YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- IN A POSITION CERTAINLY ORDERS THIS KIND OF TREATMENT THAT SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THANK YOU AND I I'VE NEVER SAID THIS BEFORE BUT YOU MADE ME CRY. THANK YOU SO I JUST A REMINDER FOR THE AUDIENCE -- THE THE RULES OF THE HOUSE ARE THAT NO -- NO VERBAL RIGHT NO VERBAL -- DEMONSTRATIONS BECAUSE AGAIN RESPECT TO THE THEY NEED A HOUSE SO -- DOUBT WHETHER IT'S SO VERBAL EXPRESSIONS ARE SNAPPING FINGERS BUT WE LIKE YOU LIKE SOMETHING TO THIS. OKAY THAT'S FINE. GOOD YES THERE YEAH YOU CAN DO THIS IF YOU LIKE SOMETHING. RIGHT -- SO -- THIS IS JUST A REMINDER FOR EVERYONE -- SO. I GUESS MY QUESTION I KNOW THAT -- I DID HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THAN ALICE'S FROM SUPER APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK YOU DID CAN YOU JUST PERHAPS SPEAK TO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU SAW IN IN THE STUDY -- IN YOUR EXAMINATION -- OF THIS ISSUE. BUT IN TERMS OF THIS THE EVIDENCE IS AVAILABLE THAT OUR FACULTY CONSIDERED -- WHILE THERE IS A GREAT DEAL A GREAT DEAL IS ALSO OBSERVATIONAL WHICH IS COMPARING COURSE AGAINST. NOT SO SPECIFIC AS THE MODALITIES WERE DISCUSSING HERE. THE STRONGER EVIDENCE IS NOT AS COMMON FOR ANY OF THE MODALITIES AND OUR FACULTY CONSIDERED AT ALL AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A PREPONDERANCE. FOR NOT ONLY DEVELOPMENTAL AND THE BEHAVIORAL BASE BUT THE THE HYBRIDS IS REALLY SOMETHING OF A MIX BETWEEN THE TWO INTERESTED IN BOTH OF THE THEORIES IN TERMS OF HOW IT WORKS. I APPRECIATE THAT -- DIE A TO THE IN A CENTER PORTANTINO I AND I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH THEIR TO ME BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN PART OF MY CAREER -- THE I HAVE A BACKGROUND IN. PUBLIC HEALTH IN THIS INTO MY MASTERS PUBLIC HEALTH IS ON FOCUSED ON ON CLINICAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SO EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES OR SOMETHING THAT IS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME. I THINK I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING AMENDED BECAUSE THE DEFINITIONS -- CAN BE A LITTLE CHALLENGING AND ACTUALLY I WANT TO BE SURE WE DIDN'T PUT A DEFINITION CODE THAT WASN'T BUT THE SAME TIME I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE DO IN MEDICINE. THAT WE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE DOING BIG STUDIES IS EXPENSIVE SO BIG STUDIES HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN DONE I MEAN WE LOOK AT NEONATOLOGY I'M PEDIATRICIAN. WHAT OF THOSE STUDIES ARE VERY IS -- THE UPDATE INVOLVED TO TWENTY PATIENTS OR TWELVE PATIENTS OR SOMETHING AND DEAL WE WE DON'T WANT WHAT WE CALL EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE -- SO THAT SOUNDS EXAMINE EXPERT BUT SAME TIME WE ALSO TO TAKE THE THE DATA THAT WE HAVE AN EXISTENCE AS A WILL WHICH DIRECTION IS A LOOK LIKE NOW SOMETIMES IT'S WRONG AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE DIRECTION. BUT WE CAN'T SAY WELL IF WE SOMEONE DIDN'T DO A BIG STUDY WE DON'T DO ANYTHING AND WE'RE NOT% GOING TO PROVIDE CARE RIGHT WE HAVE A PATIENT WHO NEEDS HELP. AND SO THEY NEED TO GET CARE AND THAT'S SO I THINK IF WE IT IS NOT A CASE WHERE A PHYSICIAN IS WILLFULLY -- JUST TRYING TO AND HAS A CONFLICT AND THEY'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT THERE'D YOU EXERCISING THE BEST CLINICAL JUDGMENT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO THERE ISN'T RESEARCH ON EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF CARE. THEY'RE USING THE BEST CLINICAL JUDGMENT USING THE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. I THINK WE HAD AN IDEAL THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT MEDICAL NECESSITY DEFINITIONS AND ALL THAT WE'LL GET INTO THAT BUT I MEAN I'VE FUNDAMENTALLY I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN'T SAY THAT WELL WE NEED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT. AND AND I THINK WHAT YOU HEAR IS THAT YOU HAVE A BEHAVIOR DEVELOPMENTAL TOO SO IT'S NOT LIKE SOMEONE. YOU KNOW JUST GOT ANY FOUND THE DOCTOR TO TELL THEM WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR DAVE STATE THAT THEIR OWN BE GIVEN DEVELOP THE FUTURE IS A SPECIALIST IN THE FIELD SAID. YOU KNOW WHAT BASED ON EVERYTHING I SEE WITH YOUR CHILD IN MY KNOWLEDGE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY BENEFITS. SIGNIFICANTLY. I FIND IT HARD TO SAY WELL GUESS WHAT WE'VE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE ARTISAN BENEFIT BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO COVER THAT. I MEAN THIS IS NOT SOMEONE WHO HASN'T BEEN EVALUATED FAIRLY THOROUGHLY AND AND SO -- SO I AM YEAH I I UNDERSTAND AND AND DOES THE SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO PUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT PIECES TOGETHER BUT AND ADMIT I TRAINING BEHAVIOR DEVELOPMENTS -- NOT FORMAL BE INDIE DR BUT I I DO I DO THINK THAT -- WE WE NEED -- TO THAT -- THAT WE WE NEED TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO HOW. TO TO TO TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE FAMILIES ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE -- TREATMENTS THAT -- THE BILL PROVIDES EVIDENCE SHALL BE GREAT WE HAD BETTER BIGGER STUDIES AND HOPEFULLY PEOPLE CONDUCTORS BIGGER STUDIES BUT I AND I AM NOT SURE WE SAY WELL UNTIL THAT HAPPENS WE DON'T. WE DON'T KNOW WE WE CAN'T. COVER IT SELL -- THAT I HEAR A MOTION ON THE BILL OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OKAY JUST IN THE MOTION SIR PORTANTINO DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IBM.

OKAY NEXT ITEM IS -- ITEM NUMBER FIVE I SEE SAYS CENTER ARCHULETA HAD IT THERE YOU GO ALRIGHT SO ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB TWO EIGHTY NINE BUT CENTER ARCHULETA WELCOME. NICE ON THE AUDIENCE. GET THE PODIUM THE WITNESSES GET THE TABLE. AND I SHOULD DIE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. THEY'RE ALL BEHIND ME. THE WELCOME PLACE AGAIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF HAD AND MY COLLEAGUES SLATED AND GENTLEMAN. I AM HERE TO PRESENT -- SENATE BILL -- TWO EIGHTY NINE I AM SO PROUD HONOR TO PRESENT THIS BECAUSE IT MEANS A LOT TO ME AND ALL THE VETERANS. WHO SERVED THIS GREAT COUNTRY -- IT PERTAINS TO CONSIDERING SENATE BILL TWO EIGHTY NINE WHICH PERTAINS TO THE MEDI CAL NINETEEN FIFTEEN SEAT WAIVER PROGRAM. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK. EXISTING LAW ESTABLISHES VARIOUS HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SUPPORT SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE OUT NINETEEN FIFTEEN C. WAIVER PROGRAM. THE SERVICES ENABLE INDIVIDUALS MEMBERS OF MILITARY SERVICE FAMILIES WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE PLACED IN A LIVE IN FACILITY. TO LIVE AT HOME WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS CAN RECEIVE TRANSFER ORDERS AT ANY TIME WHILE THEY'RE SERVING. AND OFTENTIMES THESE ORDERS MOVE THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. RIGHT OUT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNDER CURRENT LAW WITH THIS MOVE HAPPENS THE FAMILY LOSES THEIR BENEFITS AND OR THE POSITION ON THE WAITING LIST. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR FAMILIES WHO PLAN TO RETURN TO CALIFORNIA AFTER THEIR SERVICE BUT WHEN THEIR ASSIGNMENT IS COMPLETED AND FOR FILLED OUT OF STATE. UNDER CURRENT LAW A FAMILY WOULD HAVE TO RE RE APPLY FOR BENEFITS UPON RETURNING TO CALIFORNIA AND START ALL OVER AGAIN ON THE MEDIC KILLED NINETEEN FIFTY SI WAIVER PROGRAM. AND THE WAITING LIST. IN TURN THIS DELAY AND THE DELAYS IT BECAUSE BY THIS -- IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEEDED SERVICES. AND THESE FAMILIES ARE THEY JUST NEED TO GET BACK IN THE SYSTEM THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. SB TWO EIGHTY NINE WOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY LAW IN ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS UPON RECEIVING ORDERS TO TRANSFER OUT OF THE STATE. TO MAINTAIN THEIR ELIGIBILITY STATUS AND ORDER PLACED ON THE WAITING LIST. THE ONLY REQUIREMENT IS THEY MAINTAIN RESIDENCY IN CALIFORNIA. SENATE BILL TWO EIGHTY NINE WOULD ALLOW MILITARY PERSONNEL AND THEIR FAMILIES TO APPLY FOR THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN C. WAIVER. PROGRAM WHEN THEY RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF THE PENDING TRANSFER. TO THE STATE OR OUT OF THE STATE. SB TWO EIGHTY NINE WOULD NOT HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON FAMILIES CURRENTLY RECEIVING SERVICES OR ON THE WAITING LIST NOW. INSTEAD IT WAS SHOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT RESOURCES REQUIRED OF THE STATE TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR DEPENDENTS IN THE SERVICE MEMBERS. THIS BILL WILL INCLUDE CALIFORNIA WITH THE OTHER THIRTY FOUR STAGE THAT HAVE ALREADY PASSED SIMILAR LEGISLATION. CALIFORNIA SHOULD ENSURE THESE MUCH NEEDED BENEFITS REMAIN A VIABLE OPTION FOR A MILITARY FAMILIES WITH SPECIAL NEEDS TO SETTLE AND THRIVE DURING AND AFTER THEIR MILITARY SERVICE. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME KELLY MAY DOUGLAS. SOUTHWEST REGIONAL LAYS ON FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE STATE LEADS ON OFFICE AS WELL AS NED MECHANIC. THE CALIFORNIA STATE DIRECTOR OF THE MARINE CORPS INSTALLATION WEST TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND I THANK YOU AND I URGE YOU FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER ARCHULETA WITNESSES SUPPORT UP TO SIX MINUTES BUT YOU CAN DO LESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIRMAN STONE -- MY NAME IS KELLY MAY DOUGLAS AND AS THE SENATOR SAID I'M OF THE SOUTHWEST REGIONAL LIAISON FOR A DEPARTMENT DEFENSE WE COVER QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES -- FOR SERVICE MEMBERS THEIR FAMILIES -- IN THE END I COVER THE THESE FIVE STATES. INCLUDING CALIFORNIA -- THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY SUPPORT OF SB -- TWO EIGHTY NINE WE HAVE FOUND THAT INDIVIDUAL STATE MEDICAID WAIVER ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND LENGTHY WAITING LISTS HANDER MILITARY FAMILIES FROM OBTAINING SOME SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE DURING CRITICAL PERIODS OF TRANSITION INCLUDING WHEN THEY'RE TRANSITIONING OUT OF THE MILITARY. WITH POTENTIALLY UNCERTAIN MEDICAL COVERAGE AND GAPS IN SERVICES. ACCORDING TO RECENT DATA OBTAINED FROM THE DEFENSE MANPOWER DATA CENTER. THERE ARE OVER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND DEPENDENTS OF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA. APPROXIMATELY TWENTY NINE THOUSAND OF THOSE DEPENDENT OUR OF SERVICE MEMBERS WHO ARE IN THE PROCESS OF SEPARATING FROM SERVICE AND OR RETIRING AND ARE LEGAL RESIDENTS OF THE STATE I ALSO AT TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN DOD COMMISSION SURVEY OF OVER FIFTY TWO THOUSAND MILITARY FAMILIES WITH SPECIAL NEEDS FOUND THAT 16% OF MILITARY MEMBERS WHO RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY. I HAVE EXPERIENCE A LOSS OF THEIR WAIVER ELIGIBILITY ENROLLMENT OR WAITING LIST STATUS. DUE TO A MILITARY MOVE 11% HAD CHOSEN TO LIVE SEPARATELY FROM THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS DURING ON ASSIGNMENTS -- FOR FEAR OF NOT WANTING TO LOSE THEIR WAITED WE WEAVER STATUS AND 71% HAVE STATED THAT THEIR DECISION TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOME STATE AFTER LEAVING THE MATCH THE MILITARY SERVICE WAS INFLUENCED BY. A DESIRE TO MAINTAIN THE WAIVER STATUS FOR THEIR DEPENDENCE. A MILITARY PARENT INTERVIEWED AS PART OF A TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY PROJECT TEAM ENTITLED MEDICAID AND MILITARY FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS ACCESSING MEDICAID AND WAVERED SERVICES. SEATED IF I DECIDE TO TAKE MY CHILDREN WITH ME MY DAUGHTER AUTOMATICALLY LOSES HER MEDICAID WE ALREADY WENT THROUGH THE AGONY OF WAITING SEVEN YEARS UNTIL SHE GOT THE WAIVER NOW I WOULD HAVE TO FACE EIGHT MORE YEARS I MIGHT HAVE TO LEAVE MY FAMILY BEHIND IT'S A CATCH. TWENTY TWO SITUATION -- AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED SB -- THE POLICY IN SB TWO EIGHTY NINE DOES NOT CREATE A SPECIAL GROUP OR PRIORITY PROGRAM -- AND DOES NOT REQUIRE THE STATE TAKES SPEND ANY RESOURCES TO HOLD SLOTS FOR ME -- EMPTY FOR MILITARY FAMILIES WHILE THEY'RE OUT OF STATE IT WOULD ONLY BE -- INSTEAD PROVIDE THEM EITHER WITH A CREDIT TOWARDS YEARS THAT THEY'VE SPENT ON THE WAITING LIST. IF THERE IS ONE OR ALLOW ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS TO RESUME SERVICES UPON RETURNING TO THE STATE. WITH THE WITH SPACE AVAILABLE.

OKAY SO -- CENTER LEYVA YOU PREPARED OKAY THANK YOU I I KNOW YOU ARE BUT I JUST WANT TO ASK. ALRIGHT SO. SINCE CENTER BATES IS A I THINK STOCK BY THE OTHER COMMITTEE WILL -- WILL GO AHEAD WITH THE ITEM NUMBER ONE SB 24% -- LEYVA WELCOME. RIGHT OVER THEM GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL MUCH APPRECIATED. AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. MEMBERS AS MANY OF YOU MAY REMEMBER CIVIL OVER YOU SAW A SIMILAR VERSION OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR SB. THREE TWENTY UNFORTUNATELY AFTER PASSING BOTH HOUSES FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN VETO THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION SAYING THAT STUDENTS HAVING TO TRAVEL A GOOD DISTANCE OFF CAMPUS. TO ACCESS MEDICATIONABORTION IS NOT UNREASONABLE. AS A WOMAN AND AS A LEGISLATOR THAT STRONGLY BELIEVES IN THE CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT TO ACCESSIBLE OR XIN I BOTH RESPECTFULLY AND PROFOUNDLY DISAGREE. AS I'VE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE THIS ISSUE IS SO IMPORTANT FOR COUNTLESS UC AND CSU STUDENTS BUT I WILL NOT REST UNTIL BECOMES LAW IN CALIFORNIA. MEMBERS SB TWENTY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE ALL ON CAMPUS STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS AT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. TO PROVIDE MEDICATION FOR EARLY PREGNANCY TERMINATION FOR THEIR STUDENTS BY JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THREE ACCORDING TO THE GUTTMACHER INSTITUTE SINCE TWO THOUSAND OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES. HAVE TERMINATED EARLY PREGNANCIES THROUGH THE USE OF MEDICATION ABORTION AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WOMEN AGE TWENTY TO TWENTY FOUR ACCOUNTED THE LARGEST FOR ANY AGE GROUP MEDICATION ABORTION IS A TWO STEP PROCESS WHERE A PATIENT TAKES TWO SETS OF PILLS OVER THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS DURING THE FIRST TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. ACCORDING TO A UC SAN FRANCISCO STUDY MEDICATION ABORTION IS VERY SAFE WITH MAJOR COMPLICATIONS OCCURRING AND ONLY ZERO POINT 3% OF CASES. WHICH IS LESS THAN TYLENOL AND BY AGRA. IN A MOMENT YOU WILL HEAR MORE FROM DANIEL GROSSMAN A CLINICAL PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHER ON ABORTION AND CONTRACEPTION. WHO WILL FURTHER DISCUSS SOME OF THIS IMPORTANT RESEARCH? THOUGH MANY CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ALREADY OFFER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES SUCH AS PREGNANCY OPTIONS COUNSELING AND CONTRACEPTIVES. NONE CURRENTLY OFFER ACCESS TO MEDICATION ABORTION ON CAMPUS MEDICATION ABORTION IS A SAFE PROCEDURE AND IS CLINICALLY SIMPLER THAT MUCH OF THE CARE ALREADY OFFERED A COLLEGE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS. SUCH AS DIABETES MANAGEMENT MENTAL HEALTH CARE ANDDIAGNOSIS SLASH TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES. IF A STUDENT HAS TO GO OFF CAMPUS. TO FIND A PROVIDER THAT DOES NOT ACCEPT THEIR STUDENT OR OTHER HEALTH PRIVATE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE PAYING FOR MEDICATION ABORTION MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL BURDEN. IN TOTAL TWENTY TWO UC AND CSU CAMPUSES ARE MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES AWAY FROM THE CLOSEST ABORTION PROVIDER VIA PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. THIS CARE REQUIRES TWO TRIPS TO A HEALTH CLINIC MEANING TWO HOURS OF TOTAL TRAVEL TIME. THESE BURGERS OR WORSENED SINCE ONLY 15% OF THE CLOSEST OFF CAMPUS ABORTION PROVIDERS ARE OPEN ON WEEKENDS BEING THAT STUDENTS MAY HAVE TO MISS CLASS MISS EXAMS. AND WORK TO ACCESSIBLE OPTION WHICH THE SUPREME COURT HAS DETERMINED TO BE A PROTECTED CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. BEING ABLE TO ACCESS MEDICATION ABORTION ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES IS CRITICAL SINCE WOMEN MUST RECEIVE THIS CARE WITHIN THE FIRST TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. MOST WOMEN DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY'RE PREGNANT TO THE FIFTH OR SIXTH WEEK OF PREGNANCY. MEMBERS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE ISN'T JUST A SLOGAN BUT RATHER A COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING THE TRUE ACCESS TO ABORTION FOR CALIFORNIANS ACROSS OUR STATE INCLUDING COLLEGE STUDENTS AT UC'S AND SEE ISSUES. WITH ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AS DR DANIEL CRESSMAN PROFESSOR AND DIRECTOR OF ADVANCING NEW STANDARDS AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AT UC SAN FRANCISCO. AND JUST THE WAS ALL AS A RECENT GRADUATE OF UC RIVERSIDE I WILL DEFER TO MY WITNESSES MISTER CHAIR. I THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA WITH THE SUPPORT OF BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU SIX MINUTES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY. AS SENATOR LABOR MENTION I DIRECT ADVANCING NEW STANDARDS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO AND WE PUBLISHED TWO STUDIES IN PEER REVIEWED JOURNALS RELATED TO THE COLLEGE STUDENT RIGHT TO ACCESS ACT. THE FIRST LOOKED AT HOW OFTEN STUDENTS SEEK ABORTION CARE AND WHETHER THEY FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS. STUDENTS ACROSS THE THIRTY FOUR UC AND CSU CAMPUSES OBTAIN APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND THIRTY EIGHT ABORTIONS EACH MONTH. WE ESTIMATE THAT AS MANY AS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO TO FIVE HUNDRED NINETEEN MEDICATION ABORTIONS WOULD BE PROVIDED MONTHLY ON CAMPUSES. IF STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS OFFERED THE SERVICE. WE ALSO FOUND THAT ACROSS ALL PUBLIC UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES CONSIDERING THAT THE SERVICE REQUIRES TWO VISITS THE MEDIAN TIME BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT TO THE CLOSEST PROVIDER IS AN AVERAGE OF TWO HOURS ROUND TRIP FOR MEDICATION PORTION. AND UP TO FOUR HOURS FOR STUDENTS ON SOME CAMPUSES. THE STUDENTS HAVE A LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES DO NOT HAVE A CAR ON CAMPUS AND MUST RELY ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT TRANSPORT IN ORDER TO GET TO THESE VISITS. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS TRAVELING MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES FOR HEALTH CARE RENDERS THAT CARE IN ACCESSIBLE. GIVEN THESE FINDINGS I BELIEVE THAT ABORTION KAREN CAMPUS IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE ACCESS AND DECREASED BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS. FOR THE SECOND STUDY WE STUDY THE CAPACITY OF STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS TO PROVIDE MEDICATION ABORTION ON CAMPUS AND WHAT THEY WOULD NEED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE. ALL UC AND CSU STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS ALREADY OFFER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES THE EMPLOYEE OR CONTRACTED WITH AT LEAST ONE PHYSICIAN AND OR ADVANCED PRACTICE CONDITION -- THEY HAVE THE NEEDED PHYSICAL SPACE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THE SERVICES THEY WOULD ALL NEED TRAINING -- IF NEEDED ULTRASOUND MACHINE IF THAT'S NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE TRUSTEE TIONAL AGE TO TO DATE THE PREGNANCIES. SOME SOME OF THEM WOULD NEED TWENTY FOUR HOUR TELEPHONE SUPPORT TO TRIAGE SERVICES IF THAT'S NOT ALREADY AVAILABLE. TAKING A RESEARCH INTO ACCOUNT ALONG WITH WHAT THE SENATOR LIVE ALREADY. SAID ABOUT HER MEDICATION ABORTION HAS BEEN CLEARLY PROVEN TO BE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE IN CLINICALLY SIMPLE TO PROVIDE. I BELIEVE THAT WITH THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN COMMITTED IT WOULD BE VERY FEASIBLE TO OFFER MEDICATION ABORTION AT STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS. THERE'S REALLY NO REASON IC TO EXCLUDE MEDICATION ABORTION FROM THE SERVICES THAT ARE ALREADY PROVIDED AT STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME TODAY. MY NAME IS JUST YOUR SALAS AND I AM A CAMPUS COORDINATOR -- WITH THE JUST CARE CAMPAIGN AT THE WOMEN'S FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA. THE JUST CARE CAMPAIGN MOBILIZES STUDENTS TO EXPAND REPRODUCTIVE EQUITY ON CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. THIS INCLUDES LIFTING BARRIERS TO ABORTION CARE. SENATE BILL TWENTY FOUR IS DEEPLY PERSONAL TO ME. EVERY MONTH AS DOCTOR COSSMAN ALREADY SHARED HUNDREDS OF CALIFORNIA COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR CAMPUSES FOR ABORTION CARE. THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET AT THE ON CAMPUS STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS. JUST TWO YEARS AGO. I WAS ONE OF THE STUDENTS. IN MY THIRTY YEAR AT UC RIVERSIDE I DISCOVERED I WAS PREGNANT. AS MY DOCTOR AT MY STUDENT HEALTH CENTER WENT OVER MY OPTIONS I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO GET AN ABORTION. BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET MY ABORTION ON MY STUDENT HEALTH CENTER I WAS FORCED TO NAVIGATE CUMBERSOME CONFUSING REFERRALS TO OFFSITE CLINICS THAT ULTIMATELY DELAYED. MY CARE FOR THREE MONTHS. DURING WHICH IT BECAME INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT TO LIVE MY LIFE. AS A WOMAN OF COLOR. CHILD OF IMMIGRANTS AND LOW INCOME STUDENT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO NAVIGATE THE MEDICAL SYSTEM OR INSURANCE POLICIES. I DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GET THE CARE I NEEDED OFF CAMPUS SUCH AS MONEY. AND A CAR. AND THIS IS JUST MY STORY. ONCE A STUDENT HAS DECIDED TO END A PREGNANCY THEY SHOULDN'T BE FORCED TO GO OFF CAMPUS TO SEE A PROVIDER THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE CARECAN EASILY BE PROVIDED ON THEIR CAMPUSES. LEAVING CAMPUS CAN MEAN TAKING AWAY TIME FROM CLASS AN INTERNSHIP FAMILY TIME OR YOUR JOB. IT CAN BE HARD TO RAISE THE MONEY OR FIND RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION TO A FARAWAY CLINIC -- OFFERING ABORTION CARE ON CAMPUS HELPS TO ENSURE THESE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS WHO MIGHT NEED THEM AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD ACHIEVING TRUE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND EQUITY FOR CALIFORNIA COLLEGE STUDENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANKS FOR MUCH.

THANK YOU. OKAY SURE THE INTERRUPTION. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MARY LEE SHRIDER I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF RIGHT TO LIFE OF KERN COUNTY AND POLITICAL ADVOCACY CHAIR FOR CALIFORNIANS FOR LIFE. FOR THE TWO YEARS IT TOOK SB THREE TWENTY TO MAKE ITS WAY THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE WE WERE TOLD THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL WAS TO ENSURE IMMEDIATE ACCESS FOR PREGNANT STUDENTS. TO MEDICATION ABORTION OSTENSIBLY TO LIMIT TIME AWAY FROM ACADEMIC PURSUITS. THE RESURRECTED VERSION WE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY SB TWENTY FOUR IS A COPY OF ITS PREDECESSOR ERRONEOUS ASSERTIONS AND ALL. COMMITTEE HEARINGS ON SB THREE TWENTY FOCUSED ON STUDENTS ALLEGED IMPEDIMENTS TO ABORTIONS AND UNIVERSITIES RELATED COSTS AND LIABILITY CONCERNS. HOWEVER AT NO TIME. HAS ANYONE POSE THE MOST RELEVANT QUESTION IS MEDICATION ABORTION THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD. TO MEET SB TWENTY FOUR STATED GOALS. RESEARCH AND RECOMMENDATIONS BY RECOGNIZED X. EXPERTS IN OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY STRONGLY INDICATE IT IS NOT. IN HIS VETO MESSAGE OF SB THREE TWENTY GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN DISMISSED THE BILL AS A NECESSARY BUT HE WAS ONLY HALF RIGHT. MEDICATION ABORTIONS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES ARE NOT ONLY UNNECESSARY THEY ARE CONTRA INDICATED. MY COLLEAGUE HERE WILL SPEAK FURTHER ON THAT BUT AS I SAID SB TWENTY FOUR LIKE IT'S PREDECESSOR CONTAINS RONI'S INFORMATION. AND FAILS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY BOTH LIFE ADVOCATES AND THE UNIVERSITIES. PROPONENTS OF LAST YEAR'S SB THREE TWENTY ASSERTED THAT STUDENTS SEEKING EARLY PREGNANCY TERMINATION OFTEN FACE HOURS OF TRAVEL FROM THE CAMPUS CITY COUNTY OR EVEN GEOGRAPHIC REGION. THIS NOTION WAS SO THOROUGHLY DEBUNKED THAT IN HIS VETO MESSAGE GOVERNOR BROWN CITED THE ACTUAL AVERAGE DISTANCE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA STATE FUNDED UNIVERSITIES AND THEIR NEAREST MEDICAL ABORTION PROVIDERS. OF ONLY SIX MILES YET SOMEHOW THE RONI'S LANGUAGE APPEARS AGAIN IN SB. TWENTY FOUR YOU FIND ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES OF STILL ON ADDRESS CONCERNS ON PAGE FOR THE REPORT YOU HOPEFULLY HAVE THE FOR YOU. OUR GREATEST CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS IT'S INDIFFERENCE TO THE SERIOUS ADVERSE AFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICATION ABORTION USE. SINCE APPROVING MIFEPRISTONE IN TWO THOUSAND THE US FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AS ADMINISTRATION REPORTED MORE THAN. ONE THOUSAND A SKEWS ME REPORTED MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND CASES OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DRUG. OF THOSE MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND WOMEN REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATIONS INCLUDING FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT TO EXPERIENCE BLOOD LOSS SO SEVERE THEY REQUIRE TRANSFUSIONS. AND A TWENTY SEVENTEEN SUMMER THE FDA ALSO REPORTS THAT TWENTY TWO WOMEN HAVE DIED AFTER USING THE DRUG. INCLUDED IN THE REPORT BEFORE YOU IS A LEGAL OPINION OF THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY AND EXPENSE OF UNIVERSITIES WILL FACE IF SB. TWENTY FOUR IT'S PAST IN SUMMARY THE OPINION FINDS THERE'S NO CONSIDERATION IN THE BILL FOR POTENTIAL LIABILITY EXPOSURES. AND OTHER EXPENSES THAT CLINICS MAKER SHOULD SB TWENTY FOUR BECOME LAW. IT ALSO FINDS IT'S COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY TO REQUIRE MEDICAL PROCEDURES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES THAT CREATES SIGNIFICANT RISK OF INJURY OR EVEN DEATH. COMMITTEE WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO TO VOTE NO ON SB TWENTY FOUR HELLO. MY NAME IS MONICA SNYDER AND I'M ONE OF THE ATHEISTS WHO CO LEADS THE GROUP SECULAR PRO LIFE. IRON MY BACHELORS FROM UC BERKELEY IN TWENTY ELEVEN AND MY MASTER'S FROM UC DAVIS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND I'M HERE TO TALK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT SOME CONCERNS ABOUT SB. TWENTY FOUR ADMINISTRATORS INDICATED SB TWENTY FOUR IS NOT ONLY UNNECESSARY BUT ALSO CONTRAINDICATED. IN SENATOR LATEST PRESS RELEASE REGARDING THIS BILL SHOULD DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF TIMELY REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE AND ABORTION CARE WITHOUT DELAY. BUT IT'S UNCLEAR HOW SB TWENTY FOUR WOULD ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS BECAUSE MEDICATION ABORTION IS NOT. TIMELY. EVEN IF OFFER DIRECTLY ON CAMPUS MEDICATION ABORTION IS MORE TIME CONSUMING GENERALLY THAN OFF CAMPUS SURGICAL ABORTIONS SURGICAL ABORTION TYPICALLY REQUIRES A SINGLE APPOINTMENT WITH NO FOLLOW UP. MEDICATION ABORTION USUALLY REQUIRES A FIRST APPOINTMENT TO RECEIVE MIFEPRISTONE IN MICE ACOSTA ALL AND TIME SET ASIDE IN THE DAY OR TWO AFTER TO ENJOY THE BLEEDING CRAMPING KNOWLEDGE AND EXPULSION OF THE EMBRYO. AND THEN A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT DAYS OR WEEKS LATER TO ENSURE A COMPLETE ABORTION. THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICS GYNECOLOGIST ORGANIZATION OF OVER FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND OBGYN WHICH SUPPORTS ABORTION RIGHTS. EXPLAINS THE MEDICATION ABORTION QUOTE TAKES LONGER TO COMPLETE REQUIRES MORE ACTIVE PATIENT PARTICIPATION AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER REPORTED RATES OF BLEEDING AND CRAMPING AND QUOTE. IF THE MEDICATION ABORTION IS UNSUCCESSFUL THE WOMAN WILL NEED TO EITHER DO OR THE PROCESS AGAIN OR RECEIVE SURGICAL FOLLOW UP. AND MEDICATION ABORTIONS ARE FREQUENTLY UNSUCCESSFUL FTA GUIDELINES STATE MEDICATION ABORTION CAN BE OFFERED UP TO TEN WEEKS INTO PREGNANCY BUT THE EFFICACY RATE DECREASES AS THE PREGNANCY PROGRESSES. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBGYN MEDICATION ABORTION AT NINE WEEKS HAVING EFFICACY RATE AS LOW AS 85%. MEANING THAT UP TWO OR MORE THAN ONE OUT OF SEVEN WOMEN AT THAT STAGE WOULD NEED SURGICAL FOLLOW UP THERE'S NOTHING TIMELY ABOUT THAT PROCESS. GIVEN HOW COMMON IT IS FOR WOMEN WHO SEEK MEDICATION ABORTION TO REQUIRE SURGICAL FOLLOW UP. FDA GUIDELINES AND CALIFORNIA REQUIRE THAT MEDICATION ABORTION PROVIDERS. QUOTE MUST ALSO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY NECESSARY SURGICAL INTERVENTION OR HAVE MADE A RANGERS FOR OTHERS TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE AND QUOTE. SO UNLESS THE UNIVERSITY HEALTH CENTER START PROVIDING SURGICAL ABORTION ON SITE. THEY WILL NEED TO PARTNER OFTEN WITH THE SAME FACILITIES THAT THE BILL'S SPONSORS ADJUSTER TO DISTANT -- AN ACCESSIBLE FOR THIS PATIENT POPULATION. GIVEN ON AVERAGE ABORTION PROVIDERS ARE ABOUT SIX MILES FROM OUR CAMPUS UNIVERSITIES THE BILL IS A NECESSARY BUT GIVEN THE TIME CONSUMING NATURE OF MEDICATION ABORTION THE BILL SEEMS CONTRADICTORY. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE BILL'S SPONSORS GIVE A MORE COMPELLING RATIONALE THAT WOULD JUSTIFY MANDATING. THAT OUR UNIVERSITIES TAKE ON THESE RESPONSIBILITIES EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES THANK THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

TWO AND A HALF PERCENT OF WOMEN WHO USE THIS TREATMENT UP TO TEN WEEKS WILL NEED TO HAVE AN ASPIRATION PROCEDURE -- ME AS A PROVIDER I CAN SAY THAT. USUALLY WHEN WHEN A PATIENT USES HER INSURANCE THAT SHE PAYS THE INSURANCE COVERS ALL THE SERVICES INCLUDING THE CASE OF NEEDING AN ASPIRATION ALSO IN CASES WHEN A PATIENT SELF PAYS FOR THE PROCEDURE SHE DOESN'T PAY ANYMORE. IF SHE NEEDS TO HAVE A SO THE ASPIRATION PROCEDURE DONE. THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS A TWO MORE QUESTIONS I APOLOGIZE -- STUDENT HELP PHYSICIANS OR NURSE PRACTITIONERS THAT TEND TO WORK IN THESE CLINICS ARE FACILITIES THAT ARE ON CAMPUS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ON DATA THAT THEY HAVE LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN JUDGING JUST STATION ONLY EACH AND THIS -- BASED ON YOUR OWN TESTIMONY HERE TODAY THAT THE JUST STATION LATER THIS PILL THAT IS TAKEN. NEEDS TO BE TAKEN. BETWEEN EIGHT TO TEN WEEKS OF JUST STATION -- THE AUTHORS ON STATEMENT MOST WOMEN DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE PREGNANT FOR FORTY FIVE WEEKS. AND THAT PUTS YOU AT FOUR TO FIVE WEEKS AND THE BILL HAS TO BE TAKEN WITHIN EIGHT TO TEN WEEKS. AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHO'S GOING TO JUDGE THE JUST STATION ONLY AGE -- BUT I KNOW IT'S DONE BY PELICAN EXAM USUALLY OR ALTER SOUND OR THEIR OLDER SOME FACILITY -- ULTRASOUND EQUIPMENT ON THESE CAMPUSES [inaudible] AND A WHO IS A IN D. WHO'S GONNA JUDGE THE JUST STATION ONLY EACH OF THE BABY GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO EACH CAMPUS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET THEIR HEALTH CENTERS UP AND RUNNING WHAT WE FOUND WE FIRST INTRODUCED THIS BILL. IS THAT OUR HEALTH CENTERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE AT C. ISSUES AND UC'S RANGING FROM A LITTLE. A LITTLE CLOSET AND YOU GO IN AND SAY HELLO HERE'S AN ASPIRIN GOOD WILL AND GOT SPEED TO FULL BLOWN BEAUTIFUL MEDICAL CENTERS THAT'S WHY WE ORIGINALLY MADE THE BILL A TO YOUR BILL SO WE CAN MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE FUNDING. SO WE CAN GET EVERY CAMPUS UP AND RUNNING BECAUSE EACH CAMPUS WILL NEED TO HAVE A SONOGRAM MACHINE SO THAT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT WILL BE PROVIDED TO EACH CAMPUS WILL BE FOR THAT. ADDITIONALLY EACH UCC EACH SYSTEM WILL BE PROVIDED WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE WHAT WE HEARD IS THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF A TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOTLINE. SO THEY WILL GET THAT IN ADDITION TO THAT -- SO PHYSICIANS BOTH EMPTIES INDIOS CAN ADMINISTER THIS NURSE PRACTITIONERS CERTIFIED MIDWIVES A PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANTS. THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME. A CENTER MITCHELL THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SINCE THIS IS THE POLICY COMMITTEE NOT THE FISCAL COMMITTEE I'M GONNA FOCUS MY QUESTIONS ON THE POLICY. I'M READING THE OPPOSITION THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO US TODAY -- ONE PAPER REALLY FOCUSES ON ABORTION AND ITS SUBSEQUENT IMPACT ON MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. SO I'M NOT GOING TO ADDRESS IT BECAUSE WHAT'S NOT UP FOR DEBATE TODAY IS. THE LEGALITY OF ABORTION IT IS STILL A CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT SO I'M NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THAT. I AM GOING. TO LOOK AT THE COLLEGE CAMPUS ABORTIONS CHECKING AN IDEOLOGICAL BOX. THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS JUST SHARED WITH ALL OF US. CAN I THINK IT GOES TO ONE OF THE OPPONENTS. POINTS ABOUT. REFERENCING THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION'S VETO MESSAGE ABOUT YOU'LL CHALLENGING WHETHER OR NOT OR MAKING BASICALLY A JUDGMENT CALL ABOUT -- WHAT THEY DEEMED AN ACCEPTABLE DISTANCE VERSUS SOMEONE ELSE AND WHAT STRIKES ME WHEN I LOOK AT THE CHART THAT WAS PROVIDED UNPAID PAGE? FOR ALL OF THE CLINICS THEY REFERENCE OUR PLAN. KßT CLINICS. PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINICS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING CHALLENGES FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO BE MEDI CAL PROVIDERS -- BECAUSE OF THE NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS -- GAG RULE IN A NUMBER OF THINGS SO AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT NONE OF THESE CLINICS COULD BE AVAILABLE -- TO PROVIDE ANY SERVICE MUCH LESS ABORTION SERVICES SO I'M NOT SURE. IF IT'S APPROPRIATE OR FAIR TO EXPECT -- THAT THESE CLINICS WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE SO ABSENT THAT -- WHAT WITH YOUR COMMENTS BE IN TERMS OF? ME EXERCISING. MY CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT TO AN ABORTION -- IF INDEED THIS CLINTON CELLS IN A LONGER AVAILABLE. IF IF IF YOU'RE A WHOLE ARGUMENT IS [inaudible] GEOGRAPHY. YOU FOLLOW ME. YES MA'AM MY VOLUME ALL RIGHT. I WOULD SAY THAT. AND THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD LEAVE TO PEOPLE THAT ARE MARKS HAS MUCH MORE EXPERTISE HAN PASSING LEGISLATION BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. IT'S VERY RISKY TERRITORY TO PASS LEGISLATION ON POTENTIAL FUTURE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE NOT OCCURRED. AND SO WHETHER IT'S ABOUT ABORTION OR ANYTHING ELSE REALLY. IF THE IDEA OF THE ARGUMENT AND CORRECT ME IF I'M MISUNDERSTANDING YOU BUT IF THE ARGUMENT IS THAT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE OUR UNIVERSITIES PROVIDE ABORTIONS IN CASE ABORTION CLINICS ALREADY EXISTS THESE. TWO THAT I THINK THAT GOES WELL BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS BILL HAS FOCUSED VERY. CLEARLY AND CAREFULLY ON HOW WE ARE NOT PROVIDING SURGICAL ABORTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WHICH PART OF MY ARGUMENT WAS THAT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE IN TERMS OF SAVING STUDENTS TIME. AND I THINK THAT. IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ANSWER. I THINK IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO ANSWER FOR IT FOR THE KIND OF SPECULATION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I GUESS. IF IT WERE ME. I WOULD LOOK AT ALL THE PROVIDERS NOT JUST BECAUSE WE KNOW PLAN PARA HAS NOT THE ONLY ABORTION PROVIDER I'M READING FROM YOUR CHART AND SO YOUR CHART LISTS. THE WHOLE COLUMN WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD PROVIDERS. ALL WHO ARE WITHIN SIX MILES YES MA'AM I AGREE BUT I'M SAYING IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION THAT I WOULD LOOK AT WHAT LEGISLATION YOU THINK IS GOING TO PREVENT PLANNED PARENTHOOD PREVENTING ABORTION PROVIDING ABORTION. IF IT APPLIES TO ALL THE CLINICS WERE TALKING ABOUT AND UNDER THAT LANDSCAPE WHAT IT WOULD MEAN FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT HAS MUCH TO DO WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY BECAUSE THAT HAS NOT. OCCURRED IN TO MY KNOWLEDGE IN CALIFORNIA IS UNLIKELY. TO SO. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT. SO I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I WOULD HAVE. TO I WOULD HAVE TO SEE THAT SITUATION AND AND THEN CONSIDER THE ARGUMENT. I I APPRECIATE THAT AND I ONLY RAISED IT BECAUSE I'M READING THE CHART THAT WAS PROVIDED TO ME BY THE OPPOSITION. THAT AN ARBITRARY NOTION THAT SIX MILES WAS DEEMED ACCEPTABLE I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT OF THE BILL THAT IS BEFORE US. IS THAT IT SHOULD BE A SERVICE AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS ON THEIR CAMPUS -- I APPRECIATE THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION -- OPINED [inaudible] THAT. CLINICS WORK CLOSE ENOUGH AND THE POINT I'M RAISING IS I THINK IT IS A VERY -- TROUBLING BUT POTENTIAL LIKELIHOOD -- BASED ON THE CURRENT -- CONSISTENT ACTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THESE CLNICS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THESERVICES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. THAT HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT ATTACK IN MESSAGE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WE ARE CURRENTLY FIGHTING A TITLE TEN GAG ORDER AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD BE THAT THAT CATEGORY. I HOPE TO SHARE YOUR OPTIMISM BUT I'M VERY CONCERNED. BUT I JUST THINK IF THAT'S THE ARGUMENT YOU'RE GONNA RAISE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IS ON THE TABLE AND WE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION ON A REGULAR BASIS INCLUDING THE BUDGET. IN TERMS OF OUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT PROSPECTIVE ACTIONS WE DO IT ALL THE TIME SO THAT. CLEARLY WITHIN OUR LANE. IT WAS -- IS OKAY IF I RESPOND WITH THE ONLY IF YOU HAVE TO CHECK DO WE SHOULD RESPOND YES THANK YOU A YES PLEASE. THE ONLY OTHER THOUGHT I HAD IS THAT IT'S NOT I THINK IT'S INHERENTLY AND IN THE I'M GOING TO BE. A MATTER OF OPINION DECIDING WHAT IS OR IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE DISTANCE AND I AGREE UP FOR DEBATE I AGREE BUT I DON'T THINK THE ARGUMENT IS SOLELY WHAT IS AN ACCEPTABLE DISTANCE THIS ISN'T. A SITUATION OF INFINITE TIME AND RESOURCES AND I THINK PART OF THE ARGUMENT AND THIS HAS. THIS IS NOT SPEAKING TO PRO LIFE OR PRO CHOICE AT ALL IN MY OPINION IT'S SIMPLY. WE'RE GOING TO REQUIRE THE UNIVERSITIES TO TAKE ON SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVEN'T ELECTED TO TRY TO DO ON THEIR OWN. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT IT'S GOING TO COST SOME NON ZERO AMOUNT VERY LARGE NON ZERO AMOUNT. OF TRAINING IN EXPENSES AND RESOURCES AND THEN. THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCE OF CONSIDERATIONS OF FOR EXAMPLE IF LET'S SAY THE NEAREST ABORTION CLINIC WAS. ON AVERAGE THIRTY MILES AWAY THEN WE MIGHT START TO BE MORE LIKE WELL THAT'S THAT'S VERY STRONGLY IN THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU'RE MAKING OR IF IT WAS ON AVERAGE A BLOCK AWAY THEN IT WOULD SEEM. LESS COMPELLING SO I THINK IT DOES MATTER TO LOOK AT AVERAGE DISTANCE AND LOOK AT WHAT THE BILL IS GOING TO COST WHAT LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT OPEN THE UNIVERSITIES UP TO OR NOT IT'S WORTH DISCUSSING. BUT IT'S NOT SIMPLY ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION BECAUSE IF THIS WAS SOLELY ABOUT. THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION NO MATTER WHAT THE COST THEM I AGREE THE RENO POINT LOOKING AT THE GEOGRAPHY IF THAT MAKES SENSE BUT IT IS ALWAYS GOING. TO WELL YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A BALANCE OF RESOURCES AND RIGHT THAT WAS PART OF THE I THINK THAT WAS THE PART OF THE THOUGHT PROCESS WHEN IT WAS VETOED. I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND THIS IS THE POLICY COMMITTEE THE RESOURCE CONVERSATION TAKES PLACE IN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SO I'M REALLY FOCUS ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE POLICY ITSELF. ANOTHER WITNESS WANTED TO RESPOND TO MY POINTS TO THE CHAIR IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK PLEASE. YEAH I JUST -- REGARDLESS OF DISTANCE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THE THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IS THIS BILL IS ABOUT ACCESS. AND ACCESS TO MY RATES AND IN THAT THREE MONTH PERIOD THAT I DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO MARS I HAD NO RIGHTS ESSENTIALLY SAID THIS IT IS ABOUT ACCESS. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S SIX MILES TEN MILES THIRTY MILES IT SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE NO MATTER THE DISTANCE AND MAKE IT CLOSER AND MAKE IT MORE CENTRAL TO OUR STUDENTS LIVES ARE AT OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OKAY THANK YOU CENTER MITCHELL A CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER TERROR AND FIRST I WANT -- TO THANK ALL THE PEOPLE THAT CAME HERE TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE TODAY ESPECIALLY ALL OF OUR YOUNGSTERS -- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT LESSON AND AND DEMOCRACY. AND SAYING HOW WE CAN COLLEGIATELY DISCUSS ISSUES. ISSUES THAT WE AGREE WITH THIS TO USE THAT WE DISAGREE WITH AND SO I WON APPLIED YOU ALL FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE TODAY. MISTER CHAIRMAN IT TALK ABOUT TWO THINGS AND WE DID HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE UC HERE. WHILE I'M GETTING SOME SOME CONCERNS IF SHE CAN MAKE HER WAY UP I'D LIKE TO ASK QUESTIONS OF YOUR PLEASE COME TO THE TABLE SO MY CONCERNS ARE TWO OF THE FIRST IS -- SAFETY CONCERNS AND THE SECOND IS LIABILITY. THE PROPONENTS CLAIM THAT. ABORTION MEDICATION TECHNIQUES ARE EXTREMELY. SAFE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE. AND MAYBE FOR MOST WOMEN THAT'S TRUE. BUT FOR MANY THIS IS NOT THE CASE. STUDENT HEALTH CARE CENTERS ARE GENERALLY NOT EQUIPPED. TO HANDLE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES A COME WITH THE ADVERSE REACTIONS THE COME FROM ABORTION PILLS. SINCE MY FIRST PAYMENT METHOD PRESS STONE WAS APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND BY THE FDA AS WAS MENTIONED. THERE'S BEEN MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND CASES WERE SEVERE REACTIONS OF A CLEARED INCLUDING A THOUSAND WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED. AND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT WOMEN THAT IF NEEDED BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS BECAUSE OF PROFUSE BLEEDING. AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE HAVE BEEN TWENTY TWO DEATHS. DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE. TO THE MEDICAL PROCEDURE. THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT CONCLUDED THAT ONE OUT OF SIX CASES. THE TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY WHEN THE MEDICATION IS TAKEN. IS IN COMPLETE. SO WHEN THE ABORTION PILL DOESN'T WORK THE FIRST TIME. A LOT OF TIME WE WERE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT THERE'S IS LAID BEFORE THE WOMAN UNDERSTANDS THAT IT'S HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE. WHICH MEANS THAT SHE'S OFTEN HAVING TO TAKE IT A SECOND TIME WHICH IS PUSHING AGAINST THE TEN WEEK WINDOW. AND THE REST OF THE MOTHER A MUCH GREATER SINCE THE LAST TIME BEFORE BETWEEN -- TAKEN THE PILL THE SURGICAL ABORTION -- THAT MAY BE NEEDED HAS ALLOWED THAT BABY TO MATURE EVEN FOR TO A FURTHER STEP MAYBE CAUSING MORE COMPLICATIONS. IF THE MEDICATION ABORTION FAILS TO TERMINATE THE PREGNANCY THE TIME COMMITMENT AND COSTS RISE EVEN FURTHER AS A PATIENT NEEDS ANOTHER ROUND A MEDICATION ABORTION OR IF TOO LATE A SURGICAL ABORTION. IF THE MEDICAL ABORTION DOESN'T WORK AFTER TEN WEEKS THE WOMAN WILL HAVE TO UTILIZE A SURGICAL ABORTION. SECOND TRIMESTER SURGICAL ABORTIONS PROCEDURES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE AND CARRY A MUCH GREATER OVERALL RISK TO THE MOTHER. THESE RISKS INCLUDE HEAVY BLEEDING CRAMPING AND NAUSEA. M. A LOT OF YOUNG WOMEN THAT ARE HERE COLLEGE BOUND WOMEN OFTEN LIVED IN IN DORMITORIES OFTEN AND COMMUNAL. SITUATIONS IN APARTMENTS WERE BEDROOMS ARE NOT PRIVATE. THE HOUSE IS EXPENSIVE YOU HAVE ROOMMATES. ABORTION IS A HIGHLY PERSONAL DECISION THAT MUST BE MADE BY WOMAN AND THERE IS AMPLE AVAILABILITY TO ABORTION OPTIONS SIR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD. AND QUALIFIED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. HAVING CAMPUSES PROVIDE THE ABORTION PILL GIVES A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY. TWO YOUNG COLLEGE WOMEN THAT ARE SEEKING AN ABORTION. AND SO FOR MY UC OUR COLLEAGUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY. WHAT DO YOU SEE AS POTENTIAL LIABILITY? FOR THE CURE CAMPUSES. IF THE ABORTION PILL IS UNSUCCESSFUL. ANY COMPLICATIONS ARISE THE CAMPY. MITIGATED IF YOU WILL. WITH YOUR ON CAMPUS CLINIC. WHERE YOUR PATIENTS MAY HAVE TO GO TO HOSPITAL? SURGERY CENTER. TO MAYBE EVEN SAVE THEIR LIFE. WELL SENATOR STONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AND I I I WANT TO BACK UP A LITTLE BIT IN MY HASTE TO SAY I WAS A TWEENER DID NOT INTRODUCE MYSELF AND I WANT TO DO THAT NOW MANY. ANGELA KELLY I'M THE DIRECTOR OF STATE HEALTH POLICY FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HEALTH SYSTEM. AT THE UNIVERSITY DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND I THINK VERY EFFECTIVELY AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE CONTINUE WE WANT TO CONTINUE. TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. I I KNOW IT MIGHT SEEM ODD BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY AT STUDENT NOW CAN GO IN THE COMMUNITY AND GET THE SERVICE DONE. AND STILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO HER DORM ROOM. AND STILL MIGHT HAVE THOSE SIDE EFFECTS NOW WHILE I'M NOT PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT THE NUMBERS OF THE SIDE EFFECTS AND SO FORTH WHEREVER SHE GETS THIS MEDICATION IF THERE IS GOING TO BE -- A A SIDE EFFECT -- BAD SIDE EFFECTS SHE IS GOING TO FACE THE SAME. ISSUE AND SO IT'S IF IT'S AN EMERGENCY IT'S GOING TO BE AN EMERGENCY WHETHER OR NOT. THE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM ADMINISTERS THE FIRST BILL OR WHETHER IT'S DONE TWO MILES AWAY. SO I I I I WHILE I'M NOT PREPARED TO TO TO COME IN AND I DO FEEL IF WE LOOK AT IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WOMEN ARE GETTING THIS OUTSIDE OF THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS ARE GOING BACK ON CAMPUS NOW IT. IT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ADDRESSED BY THIS BILL. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A A WOMAN IS GOING ONTO A CAMPUS FACILITY. AND THEY'RE BEGINNING AND INITIATING A MEDICAL TREATMENT THAT HAS COMPLICATIONS. AND THOSE COMPLICATIONS CAN INSTANCES ALBEIT RARE. CAN BE THAT THE LIFE OF THE WOMAN. ALL FOR HOSPITALIZATION TO MITIGATE HEMORRHAGING. I BELIEVE THERE CAN BE A LIABILITY ON THE CAMPUS THAT INITIATED THAT TREATMENT SO. YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION I APPRECIATE THAT. MY MY CONCERN ABOUT THE LIABILITY OF COLLEGE CAMPUSES -- IT REMAINS AND I'M HOPING THAT THE AUTHOR WILL WILL WORK THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND ASSUMING THE BILL GETS OUT WHICH I'M SURE PROBABLY WILL -- BECAUSE THIS COULD BE OF A LOT OF EXPOSURE -- THE YOUNG AND THE LIVES OF YOUNG WOMEN WHO MAY FACE SEVERE COMPLICATIONS IS ALSO A MAJOR CONCERN OF MINE HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF WOMEN ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES NEEDS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND GIVING THEM A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY WITH AN EASY FIX. TO THE ABORTION NEEDS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A WISE COURSE OF ACTION TO TAKE SO FOR THOSE REASONS. I'M NOT GONNA BILLS FOR THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SENATE MITCHELL. THANK YOU THINK THE IS QUESTION OF LIABILITY IS A FASCINATING -- ONE MISS KILL YOUR COULD YOU EDUCATE THOSE OF US WHO'VE NOT BEEN ON A CALIFORNIA COLLEGE CAMPUS IN RECENT DECADES. WELL I WAS REFERRING TO MYSELF BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE FOR IT TO ME BUT SINCE YOU CALLED THEM YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR YOUNG ADULTS THAT MAKES ME YOU KNOW I COULD ADJUST MINE. BUT REMIND ME HELP ME -- UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF RANGE OF MEDICAL SERVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY -- PROVIDED IF YOU COULD SPEAK GLOBALLY SO THE FEE ISSUEREPRESENT DOESN'T HAVE DOESN'T HAVE TO COME FORWARD. BECAUSE OF THE TALK ABOUT LIABILITY -- I WONDERED HOW YOU HANDLE LIABILITY ON UP ON ANY OF THE SERVICES THAT YOU PROVIDE ON CAMPUS. SO I AM AT SIX IT'S A GOOD QUESTION SENATOR MITCHELL THE THE UNIVERSITY SELF INSURED SO FOR LIABILITY WE IT DOES IT IS A DIRECT COSTS. THE UNIVERSITY TO FIVE MILLION OVER FIVE MILLION -- WE HAVE -- I'M UMBRELLA INSURANCE APOLOGIZE AND ASK YOU TO TRY TO SPEAK INTO THE MIKE FIGHT SERVICES BEHIND YOU FOR THE RECORD YES OKAY SO -- THE LIABILITY -- IT WILL CURRENTLY THE SERVICES PROVIDED ARM AT THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS RANGE DEPENDING UPON THE LOCATION AND THE HOW THE STUDENTS TO HEALTH CENTERS STAFFED. THE UNIVERSITY DOESN'T STAFF ALL UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH CENTERS THE SAME THEY EACH HAVE THEIR OWN LOCAL ABILITY TO DECIDE WHICH EXPERTISE -- EXISTED THERE CENTER WAS SERVICES THEY'LL PROVIDE THERE SOME THINGS THAT ARE COMMON ACROSS THE SYSTEM -- BUT I WOULD SAY IF IN THE EVENT OF LIABILITY IT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION IF -- EVEN ONE CASE IN THREE YEARS FOR EXAMPLE OR ONE CASE IN FIVE YEARS COULD BE -- A WITH A EXPENSIVE TO THE UNIVERSITY WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED A RISK ASSESSMENT -- AS PART OF OUR ANALYSIS -- BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S ZERO BUT I DON'T KNOW -- THE AMOUNT AND I DON'T KNOW WITH THE FREQUENCY AND THE STATISTICS IT COULD BE. ONE IN TEN YEARS OR COULD BE NEVER RIGHT I JUST DON'T HAVE THAT. EXPERTISE OR ANALYSIS AND BUT BUT MY IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR BUT MY QUESTION IS TO REMIND ME OF THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES CURRENTLY APPLIED. AT THE OFFER I'M CLEAR THAT THEY RANGE YEAH -- AS IN ANY HEALTH CARE FACILITY BASED ON GEOGRAPHY WHATEVER BUT JUST GIVE ME A SENSE -- OF WHAT THEY ARE SO IN TERMS OF THERE'S REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES SO BIRTH CONTROL -- THERE'S SOME ARE YOU D. IMPLANTATION THAT SOME OF THIS IS THAT THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS THERE'S ES T.. D. TESTING -- THERE'S A VARIETY AB DEPENDING UPON THE LOCATION SO -- THERE'S OPTOMETRY SERVICES THERE'S PRIMARY CARE SERVICES AT EACH -- STUDENT HEALTH CENTER -- THERE'S TWENTY FOUR HOUR NURSE -- AVAILABILITY EACH AND THERE'S A LOT -- I THINK A FAIRLY ROBUST MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE AVAILABLE AT EACH -- STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. SO ABOVE BEYOND THAT DOES OF THE THE CORE -- SERVICES AND YOU'LL THERE THERE WILL BE SOME SPECIALTY AT VARIOUS DIFFERENT PLACES YEAH I KNOW THE I KNOW YOU'RE TWEENER. I DON'T KNOW THE NATURE OF KIND OF YOUR DISCUSSIONS BUT BUT I'M CURIOUS FROM THE UNIVERSITY'S PERSPECTIVE. IF THIS -- US SERVICE IS OUTSIDE OF THE REALM. OF THE KINDS OF SERVICE THAT ARE CURRENTLY OFFERED IN TERMS OF THE MEDICAL. INTRICACIES FOR THE LACK OF A BETTER TERM IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU CURRENTLY PROVIDE. SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION SENATOR BECAUSE OF BOMB. FOR WHERE TWEENER BUT WE ARE NOT A TWEENER WHEN IT COMES TO REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO CHOOSE SO WE HAVE STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE THAT PROVIDES FOR THE INSURANCE. THAT ALLOWS A OUT A WOMAN TO GO TO COMMUNITY PROVIDERS AND HAVE THAT INSURANCE COVER -- I THINK WHAT HAPPENS AS A MATTER OF CALCULATION IT EACH STUDENT HEALTH CENTER THEY DECIDE WHICH SERVICES AS A MATTER OF COST ISSUE TAKEN HOUSE IN WHICH ARE -- AVAILABLE ARE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE -- BY A LOCAL -- PHYSICIANS -- AND OR CLINICS SO THIS ASSESSMENT IS REALLY AROUND COST MORE SO THAN IDEOLOGY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SOLD MATURE LET LET ME SAY THAT I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. WHAT I AM MOST INTERESTED IN IS REALLY KIND OF THE? HOW IT'S OPERATIONALIZED HOW WE IN THE SYSTEM THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT THAT PIECE -- THE ARGUMENT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT ONE IS ANTI CHOICE OR PRO CHOICE IS MOOT TO ME. IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL -- FOR THOSE WHO -- DON'T BELIEVE IN ABORTION. DON'T HAVE. ONE AND SO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD HAVE FULL COMPLETE ACCESS TO WHATEVER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES I DEEP APPROPRIATE FOR ME SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO ME. AGAIN FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE HERE UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S WHAT. MUCH OF THE OPPOSITION IS FOCUSED ON WHICH IS OFTEN THE CASE WE HAVE THIS. THIS DISCUSSION SO I'M NOT WE'RE NOT DEBATING MY RIGHT TO CHOOSE. AW AGAIN I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL. AND I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- THAT WE FIGURE OUT THE WAY IN WHICH IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE SYSTEM IN WHICH WE ARE ASKING -- PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE OTHERWISE LEGAL AND AVAILABLE. A MEDICATION. I THINK IT IS -- UNFAIR -- WHEN WE HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY OR VERY NARROWLY ON COMPLICATIONS AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR I'M CARRYING A BILL -- THAT THAT IS IT KNOWLEDGE IN THE REALITY OF THE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH RATE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MATERNAL MORBIDITY IN THE STATE. SO WE DENY THE REALITY OF THE DANGERS WHAT THAT CARRYING A BABY TO TERM. THAT THEY EXIST SO FOR GONNA TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW -- STATISTICS AND RISK TH WE WE SHOULD PRESENT THE FULL SPECTRUM BECAUSE THEIR RISK ASSOCIATED ON BOTH ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM -- BUT AGAIN I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU. CENTER GROVE THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR THAT LINE OF QUESTIONING BECAUSE IT IT BROUGHT SOMETHING TO LIGHT SORRY SINCE WE DO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE UNIVERSITY ERE I'D -- I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT. THESE NORMAL SCOPES OF OPERATIONS THAT TAKE PLACE RIGHT NOW IN THESE MEDICAL FACILITIES -- REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH -- ID IMPLANT STD TESTING CITY -- I'M ASSUMING PREGNANCY TESTING UNDER THESE ISSUES THAT YOU DID METION THAT BUT JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY -- DO THOSE AND I REALIZE YOU'RE NOT A MEDICAL EXPERT BUT DO THOSE IN YOUR POSITION THAT YOU HAVE AT THE UNIVERSITY -- LET ME PARTY DIFFERENTLY AS A BUSINESS OWNER I KNOW THAT IF I DO. X. IT CREATES A CERTAIN LIABILITY. I KNOW IF I I PROVIDE TO STAFFING RIGHT IF I STAFF SOMEBODY IN A CLERICAL OFFICE I HAVE. THIS PIECE OF LIABILITY. THERE'S A CHANCE THEY'LL GET INJURED. NOT REALLY IF I PUT A REFER ON A ROOF THERE'S A HIGHER RISK OF LIABILITY. DO YOU SEE THAT THE THIS BILL IN IMPLEMENTING THIS BILL ON A UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IS IT THE SAME. LIABILITY EXPOSURE OR DO YOU SEE IT AS A HIGHER OR LOWER. OR LIABILITY EXPOSURE -- THIS BILL HAS STORE THIS CONCEPT HAS BEEN LOOKED AT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND WE JUST HAVE NOT HEARD A LOT OF RINGING FROM THE UNIVERSITY AND WE'RE NOT A QUIET GROUP TYPICALLY. BUT ABOUT THE LIABILITY THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE'S NONE BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN IS PART OF OUR ANALYSIS. RAISING THAT IT REALLY HAS BEEN A MATTER OF STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS ARE NOT HOSPITALS AND SO HOW DO THEY MANAGE THEIR BUDGETS AND HOW DO THEY DETERMINE WHICH ARE WHICH SERVICES ARE BETTER OFFER ON WAS NOT NECESSARILY A DECISION ABOUT LIABILITY -- IT WAS MORE OF A DECISION ABOUT -- WE WE FOR OTHER SERVICES OFF CAMPUS AS WELL SO WE DON'T HAVE ALL SERVICES. IN THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER BECAUSE THE GOAL OF THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER IS TO HAVE IS LOW OR NO COST AS POSSIBLE SO WHEREVER WE CAN. FIND A COMMUNITY PROVIDER WE DO AND WHENEVER WE CAN DO IT IN HOUSE WE DO SO IT REALLY IS VERY MUCH A LOCAL DECISION AND IT'S IN IN IT AND AND THE DECISION HASN'T BEEN. LET'S LOOK AT THE STRANDS OF LIABILITY AND DECIDE THIS VERSUS THAT SO RIGHT. AT THAT THAT'S NOT BEEN -- TO MY KNOWLEDGE THE WAY THE DECISIONS ON BRINGING SERVICES ON OR OFF HAVE BEEN MADE. BUT I'M ASKING YOU IS SOMEBODY THAT REPRESENTS THE UNIVERSITY. IF YES M. THIS BILL GOES FOR WOMEN I GUESS I SHOULD SAY THIS BILL GOES FORWARD. AND YOUR MANDATED IN THE UNIVERSITIES ARE MANDATED TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE. DOES IT CREATE A GREATER RISK OF YOUR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF SELF FUNDED INSURANCE BEFORE IT GOES OUT TO RE INSURANCE. OR IS IT JUST A SIMPLE AS GIVING SOMEBODY A STICK TO URINATE ON TO SEE IF THEY'RE PREGNANT I I DON'T AND I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT WILL DEPEND ON AND THE THAT THE RISK IS IS ABOUT NUMBERS IT'S ABOUT HOW MANY POTENTIAL CASES AND THE LIKE SO -- AND SO I I I REALLY DON'T KNOW I I DON'T WANT TO I WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. AFTER THE HEARING -- BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION. AND MAYBE I COULD ASK IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BAD GEE I REALLY I'M NOT I'M JUST TRYING TO COME TO A CONCLUSION OR MAYBE -- THAT REBEKAH IT IF YOU HAVE SORRY MONICA I APOLOGIZE ISSUED A WRITTEN YOUR NAME DOWN AND I GUESS I'M NOT ASKING IT RIGHT NOW I APOLOGIZE I MEAN I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT ASKING RIGHT I GUESS. IF IF THE STUDENT A MEDICAL FACILITY ON CAMPUS WAS -- ISSUING A PREGNANCY TEST. AND WHETHER IT'S I DON'T HATE YOU ANYMORE EPT I DON'T KNOW RIGHT I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT I I DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE SO FAR FROM MY COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE BEEN OUT FOR A LONG TIME I DIDN'T GO. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THERE AND AVAILABLE ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND SO. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IF IF SOMEONE COMES IN AND SAYS I WANT THIS TEST ADMINISTERS ADMINISTERED SEE IF I AM PREGNANT. AND THEN THEY TAKE A PREGNANCY TEST. WHAT'S THE RISK OR LIABILITY FOR ISSUING THAT PREGNANCY TEST LIKE IS THERE A RISK OF BLEEDING IS THERE A RISK OF POST SURGICAL. DO YOU SEE JENNIFER EVERYTHING IN YOUR QUEST OKAY A BIT BETTER NOW OKAY GOOD I'M SO WE ROUTINELY TEST FOR PREGNANCY WE HAVE EIGHT HUNDREDS OF TESTS THAT ARE PERFORMED A MONTHLY. AND WE ROUTINELY -- COUNCIL WANTS A TEST HAS BEEN. IF IT'S A POSITIVE TEST. WE COUNSEL ON VARIOUS OPTIONS AND SO FORTH SO THAT'S A VERY -- LOW THRESHOLD I WOULD SAY KIND OF SERVICE THAT ROUTINELY PROVIDED BY EVERY STUDENT HEALTH CENTER -- IN TERMS OF FOR THE PREGNANCY TESTING DO YOU SEE THAT TED DO YOU SEE THAT PROVIDE SERVICE THAT YOU PROVIDE AN IMPACT YOUR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF AND FUNDED OR FUNDED SELF FUNDED. LIABILITY I HAVEN'T SEEN I HAVEN'T HEARD IT THAT -- PERFORMING PREGNANCY TESTS HAVE LIFTED IT I HAVE HAVE CAUSED ANY KIND OF BEING MANDATED TO PUT THIS BILL ON THE STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS DO YOU THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A WRIST HERE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF PRE FUNDED [inaudible] AND MORE OF A RISK. SO I AM I AM A LITTLE CONFUSED BECAUSE WE'RE ALREADY DOING PREGNANCY TEST THAT WON'T CHANGE THIS BILL DOESN'T MANDATE THAT IS NOT THE QUESTION IT'S IT'S A BILL IS MANDATING YOU FOR TO PROVIDE A COPY A HILL. THAT AT TERMINATE THE PREGNANCY WHICH COULD IN SOME CASES CAUSE BLEEDING CRAMPING SURGICAL PROCEDURES THAT ARE NEEDED. DOES THAT CREATE A GREATER RISK OF LIABILITY TO YOURSELF FUNDING MECHANISM IN THERE FOR YOUR REINSURANCE MECHANISM IF. SOMEONE I DON'T KNOW. TO AN WHAT I AM CENTER STONE COLD AT THE NUMBERS AND I DIDN'T WRITE HIM DOWN AGAIN AND MY MEMORIES JUST. I THINK THERE'S MAYBE A POTENTIAL BUT I WOULD HAVE TO SPEAK WITH -- SOME EXPERTS ABOUT RISK ASSESSMENT IN UTILITY TO THE UNIVERSITY THANK YOU MA'AM -- FOR MOVE ON THIS THIS ONE'S ACTUALLY PHYSICIAN. PERSON -- SO I APPRECIATE THE BACK AND FORTH -- AND I HAD A MONTH AND THE DROSS OF OF PLEASE SAVE DIED COLLEGE EYES OF A MONTH BE SURE WE GET TO YOUR QUESTION TO AYE. AGAIN I GUESS. I A HEAR THE CONVERSATION AND AND AND CERTAINLY I THINK IS YOU SAID THERE'S STILL A TIME YOU DO SOME PROCEDURE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY UNIQUE. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO SEE HOW THE THEN SOVIET DIALOGUE WITH CENTER MITCHELL AND APPRECIATE CENTER. GROVE -- WHAT YOU ALSO BROUGHT OUT -- YOU'RE GOING. TO END STAND TO FIRST OF ALL I UNDERSTAND. UC AND CSU I KNOW YOU'RE STANDING BACK THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS THE AUTHOR CORRECT ALL RIGHT. AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS BILLS COME BEFORE NOT LIKE HEARD IT CORRECTLY IF YOU'RE ROB I'M WRONG. THAT. IN MANY WAYS AT LEAST THIS WAS LIKE IN PREVIOUS ITERATION THE BILL'S THE LIABILITY WAS NOT AN ISSUE THAT ROSE TO THE POINT WHERE. PEOPLE OF THE I KNOW THERE'S LOTS OF ATTORNEYS THAT YOU SEE I'VE I'VE BECAUSE I WAS FACULTY MEMBER THERE WHO CAME BACK AND SAID OH BY THE WAY WE'RE WHERE IT REALLY WHAT ABOUT THE LIABILITY I MEAN THERE MAY BE OTHER ISSUES PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT. OKAY I I JUST. I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE TABLE BECAUSE BECAUSE THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THIS BILLS BEEN BEFORE -- THE LEGISLATURE AND YOU SEE HAS BEEN AND I ASSUME CSU HAS ALSO LOOKED AT THE BILL AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT ISSUES AND THAT THAT YOUR CLEANERS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME ISSUES. BUT I KNOW THERE'S A LOT FOCUS ON THE LIABILITY PEACE BUT THAT I'VE Y. HEARD YOU SAY JUST TO CLARIFY WAS IS THAT PEOPLE ARE AT LEAST AND SO I CAN BE ZERO AS YOU SAID BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THE BIG THING THAT RUNS WORRIED ABOUT. WELL FROM THE UC PERSPECTIVE I CAN'T SPEAK FOR CSU RIGHT AND I KNOW IT UNLOCKS IKIZI FOR UC'S YOU THAT'S WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY FOR YOU SEE. OKAY AND DISEASE YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT THING OR NOT. THE KKK COME UP BUT AT THE END TO KEEP A VERY BRIEF SO I'LL BE SURE SENATOR OTHER BANKS ONE CLEAR BY THIS POINT EXISTS WE SEEN THAT GUN AROUND A FEW TIMES. ABOUT THAT SO SO IF I CAN ASK YOU YOU HAVE LIKE A ONE SENTENCE ANSWER THAT HAD. LIKE YES OR NO. I WOULD SAY -- LIABILITY IS IS A CONCERN FOR ANYTHING IS NOT OUR GREATEST CONCERN WITH THIS OKAY CONVERSATION WITH AUTHOR AND WORKING FULL OKAY. OKAY GOT IT EXIT YES THE ANSWER IS GREATER THAN ZERO BUT NOT SO BIG THAT THAT'S THE MAIN THING. SENATOR ALSO. ANOTHER EACH THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE IT THERE SO MANY MEDICAL SERVICES EVEN IF THEY NOT IDENTICAL AT EVERY CENTER I ASSUME SAID. DEPENDING ON WHAT'S MORE NEEDED OR WHATEVER THEY DECIDED AT THAT CAMPUS. YOU KNOW I WOULD HATE TO SEE LOOKING AT WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES -- AS A GREATER RISK. OR SEEN REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES UNDER A MAGNIFYING GLASS ANDVERSES ALL THE OTHER MANY. SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED AND I'M SURE BEEN MEDICAL SERVICES THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS RISKS AND LIABILITIES ATTACHED TO THAT SO-- I JUST YOU KNOW. I HOPE THIS ISN'T YOU KNOW A WAY. TO CREATE MORE OBSTACLES FOR WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES THAT WE REALLY WOMEN FACE ENOUGH OBSTACLES AS IT IS -- BT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO JUDGE THIS ON THE FACT THAT WE'RE PROTECTING THE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND THE REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES NOT LOOKING FOR A WAY THAT'S GONNA. GET IN THE WAY OF THEIR OF THOSE RIGHTS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS -- JUST ACTUALLY I'M SORRY THANK YOU AND YOUR NAME AGAIN. AT TO SEE SAYS JESSE -- AND FIRST OFF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE CHAMBER A PERSONAL STORY -- BUT INDEED YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT -- TO BUT YOU MENTIONED IT TOOK YOU THREE MONTHS. RATE. AND YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD ABOUT SIX MILES THANKS MILES WHATEVER. DO YOU MIND SHARING WITH US -- WHAT WHY DID TAKE THREE MONTHS I MEAN WHAT? WHAT WHAT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE READER YOU WISH TO SHARE THAT WITH US I KNOW IT'S VERY PERSONAL? YEAH SURE -- SO. SO THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IS THAT I GOT PREGNANT AND I WENT TO MY STUDENT HEALTH CENTER WHERE THEY TOLD ME THAT I WAS PREGNANT -- OUT AGAIN I WAS A GRADUATE ARE I AM A GRADUATE OF UC RIVERSIDE SO AT THE UC STUDENT HEALTH CENTER -- THEY THEN SET UP ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WITH AN OB GEIN -- WHERE THAT OB GYN TOLD ME ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT PLACES I COULD GO TO STEP THREE DIFFERENT REFERRALS -- THE FIRST FACILITY THAT I WAS SENT TO DIDN'T OFFER ABORTION SERVICES -- AND SO THAT DELAYED A LOT OF MY CARE -- THE SECOND FACILITY THAT I WAS THAN REFER. TO THEN TOLD ME -- I WAS ABLE TO SCHEDULE MY APPOINTMENT THERE. BUT AFTERWARD THEY YOU KNOW AFTER YOU KNOW DEALING WITH THAT THEY SAID THAT THEY COULD. GIVE ME AN APPOINTMENT ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF OUT -- FROM THAT TIME THAT I CALLED -- AND AS YOU ALL OF MENTIONED. HAVING AN ABORTION IS A DEEPLY PERSONAL DECISION BUT ONCE SOMEONE HAS MADE THAT DECISION THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT -- AND SO SO ONE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER HERE AS YOU DISCUSS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE RIGHTS AND OUR BEAR YEARS ARE BARRIERS ARE RATES EXCUSE ME ARE EXACERBATED BECAUSE WE ARE YOUNGER PEOPLE -- SO. THAT SO FROM THERE -- I CAN GET MY APPOINTMENTS AND BRINGING UP ANOTHER BAY AREA THE STIGMA. YOU KNOW AS YOU MENTIONED CENTER YOUR ALSO PUTTING. YOU KNOW PUTTING A REPRODUCTIVE ON HEALTH CARE UNDER THIS MAGNIFYING GLASS -- I HAD REMAINED SILENT THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE TIME AND THEN FINALLY BROKE MY SILENCE WHEN -- I FINALLY WENT TO A PLANNED PARENTHOOD BECAUSE I OPENED UP AND I TOLD SOMEONE ABOUT IT. BUT DIAZ OF THOUGHT IN A NUTSHELL IS WHAT HAPPENED. OKAY I HEAR MOTION FOR THE BELT -- SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING IT AND ACTUALLY SO LEYVA. SOUNDS THAT SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THE ISSUE SO ASIDE FROM LACK OF AVAILABILITY ON CAMPUS IS ALSO AND THAT AND FRANKLY -- I COULD ASK YOU THE QUESTION I KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS IS THAT ANY FACILITY INCLUDING SOON HEALTH FACILITY SHOULD ALSO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PROVIDERS ALTHOUGH IN THIS CASE WHAT I HEAR IS THAT THEY THEY REFERRED -- FOR YOU TO A PERSON THAT DIDN'T ACTUALLY WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICE OR SOMETHING WE NEED SOME IMPROVEMENTS THERE. TOO AND I AND I KNOW THAT YOU SEE ALSO OPERATES LOTS OF MEDICAL CENTERS AS WELL SINCE I USED TO PRACTICE AT ONE DID YOU. SAY SOMETHING YES IF I MAY SENATOR JUST BRIEFLY THIS IS BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION I THINK FOR THE PAST YEAR OR SO -- ON THIS ISSUE AND ONE OF THE RESULTS OF HAVING THIS ISSUE WAS TO RECOGNIZE. THAT STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS AND WE'VE DIRECTOR ARE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS TO MAKE SURE -- THAT THEIR THEIR THEIR LISTS ARE ACCURATE INTO NOT JUST REFER BUT TO DO MORE OF A WARM HAND OFF TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENT GETS THE APPOINTMENT THAT THEY BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF THING YOU GIVE THEM A SHEET OF PAPER AND SAY GO. AND DO AN EVEN IF THIS BILL PASSES IT DOESN'T ENSURE THAT EVERY STUDENT IS GOING TO WANT TO HAVE THE PROCEDURE THERE ON THE STUDENT HEALTH CAMPUS. SO WE STILL NEED I THINK FROM THE UNIVERSITY'S PERSPECTIVE TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE OF A MORE WARM HAND OFF SO YOU'RE NOT. THREE MONTHS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT INSURANCE AND IS THIS THE RIGHT PROVIDER AND DOES IT WORK AND THAT WAS MAY I IN IN MEDI CAL IS A WHOLE NOTHER ISSUE BECAUSE CALORIE. IN RIGHT WELL YOU YOU YOU YOU SIGNED UP FOR YOUR HOME COUNTY OKAY SO GOT IT OKAY SO I THINK I THINK THE POINT'S WELL MADE I THINK WE SEE LAW THE CHALLENGES I THINK CENTER LEYVA IS OFFERING A SOLUTION I HEAR A MOTION -- CERTAINLY WHICH LIKE THE CLOTHES WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH DOCTOR PAN THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IS GREATLY APPRECIATED THERE'S TO THINGS. THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS ONE WE TALKED WE HEARD -- FROM THE OPPOSITION ABOUT ACCESS. CURRENTLY TWENTY TWO UC AND CSU CAMPUSES ARE MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES AWAY FROM THE CLOSEST ABORTION PROVIDER. AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT IF YOU READ ALL OF MY REBUTTALS AFTER WE RECEIVED THAT VETO MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR. I VEHEMENTLY AS STRONGLY DISAGREED WITH HIS ASCERTAIN SHIN -- THAT HE DID NOT THINK IT WAS INCONVENIENT SO HE MAY IT THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIS VETO MESSAGE I CERTAINLY DID NOT THINK THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE NOR DID MANY OF THIS THAT THE SUPPORTERS. SECOND I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LIABILITY. FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY WE LIVE IN A VERY LITIGIOUS SOCIETY AND IF WE ARE GOING TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPENED WHICH I DO THINK THAT'S LEGITIMATE CONCERN. WHAT HAPPENS AT THE U. S. C. RIGHT NOW WHO TREATS A STUDENT WITH DIABETES IN THE STATE AND THE STUDENT GOES INTO A DIABETIC COMA? IS THE IS THE UC ARE THIS ISSUE LIABLE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE TREATING SOMEONE FOR MENTAL ILLNESS AND THEY TRY TO HARM THEMSELVES IS THE USE YOUR THE C. ISSUE LIABLE. WHEN MY DAUGHTERS WERE IN COLLEGE THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR -- OF ONE OF THE TEAMMATES STUMBLED INTO THE ROOM SO DRUNK THAT SHE WET HERSELF AND PASSED OUT. MY GIRLS CALLED ME AND I SAID DEAR GOD HANG UP AND CALL 911- WHICH THEY DID AND LATER THE MOTHER OF THE STUDENT TRIED TO TRIED TO SUE US BECAUSE SHE LOST HER SCHOLARSHIP. AND TRIED TO SQUISH ARE TRIED TO SUE THE THE COLLEGE. SO I THINK THAT WE CAN'T ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT LIABILITY IT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE THERE IT'S UNFORTUNATELY THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN. BUT I WILL END WITH THIS. WHEN I GOT ELECTED IN CAME TO SACRAMENTO I FOUND OUT VERY QUICKLY THAT I'D KIND OF BEEN RAISED IN AND LIVED IN A BUBBLE? I LIVED IN THIS VERY WARM ENVIRONMENT WHERE MY PARENTS TALKED TO ME ABOUT MY RIGHTS WHERE I KNEW THAT A WOMAN HAD THE RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION. THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT AND THERE WAS NO SHAME AND THEN I GOT HERE AND I WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY DUMBFOUNDED. AND THIS HASN'T HAPPENED TODAY BUT DUMBFOUNDED BY HOW THE OPPOSITION SHAMED WOMEN FOR ACCESSING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT HOW WOMEN FEEL STIGMATIZED AND SO I SAID TO MYSELF I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN ANYMORE. PEOPLE DON'T EVEN WANT TO SAY THE WORD ABORTION IS LIKE A PORTION YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS PART OF LIFE EVERYWOMAN HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ACCESS IT IS YOUR BODY YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE NO ONE ELSE HAS THAT RIGHT. SO FOR ME THIS IS THIS IS PERSONAL IN THE SENSE THAT I GREW UP IN A HOUSEHOLD WHERE WE COULD HEAR THE WORD ABORTION WE COULD TALK ABOUT MY FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AS A WOMAN. AND NOW AS A LEGISLATOR I THINK IT IS MY JOB TO TRY AND HELP MAKE SURE THAT EVERY WOMAN HAS THAT CHOICE THIS BILL DOES NOT MANDATE ANYONE HAS AN ABORTION. THIS BILL SAYS THAT WOMEN HAVE A RIGHT AND THEY HAVE A CHOICE AND THAT SHOULD BE EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

ALLERGIES GETTING TO ME TODAY -- SB SIX OH FOUR REQUIRES THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. I TO ESTABLISH CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE REVISED COUNTIES WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND BEST PRACTICES. IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION. SIXTY THREE AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WAS ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THAT PROVIDED THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY IN MANY YEARS. TO EXPAND COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS FOR ALL POPULATIONS CHILDREN TRANSITION AGE YOUTH ADULTS OLDER ADULTS FAMILIES AND UNDERSERVED. IT ALSO DESIGNED. TO BE WAS ALSO DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF PREVENTION. AND EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT SERVICES INCLUDING THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGY AN ENHANCEMENT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH WORK FORCE TO SUPPORT IT. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION IS TASKED WITH OVERSEEING THE IMPLEMENTED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT RECENTLY HAS BEEN PROACTIVE IN WORKING TO PROVIDE MORE ASSISTANCE TO COUNTY SO STAKEHOLDERS. OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE COURSE OF THEIR CONVERSATIONS. LOCALS HAVE A HOUSE THE COMMISSION TO APPROVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON HOW COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY DELIVERING SERVICES.

TODAY WITH ME OF THOUGHT TOBY EWING WITH THE COMMISSION AND HE IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. ON THIS PROCESS. OKAY ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SIGNATURE CHAIR MEMBERS TOTALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION WHEN I THINK THE SENATOR FOR INTRODUCING THE LEGISLATION -- AS I THINK WE'VE TESTIFIED BEFORE YOU IN THE PAST OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WE'VE REALLY BEEN WORKING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WORKING IN THE COUNTY IS WHAT'S NOT WORKING AND WHAT KINDS OF STRATEGIES THE STATE CAN PUT IN PLACE TO HELP THE COUNTIES. AS FOR REFLECT IN THE ANALYSIS LAST YEAR WE UNDERTOOK A WHOLE SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH COUNTIES TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE. AN OVERWHELMINGLY WHAT WE HEARD IS THEY STRUGGLE TO LEARN WHAT'S WORKING IN OTHER COUNTIES WAS WORKING IN OTHER STATES. AND THAT OFTEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME OF THE CAPACITY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AND TO SECURE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IT'S OFTEN AVAILABLE. NOPE THROUGH OBTUSE FOR CONSULTANTS -- WHAT THEY'VE SAID IS THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IF THE STATE COULD PUT IN PLACE STRATEGIES? AND I WOULD AND I WOULD HAVE TO CLEAN FOCUS ON ISSUES OF STATEWIDE CONCERN SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH REDUCING CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT REDUCING CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT HOMELESSNESS. THE COMMISSION IS SUPPORTIVE OF THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT SIGNALS THAT IS THAT OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM REALLY IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES AND IF THE STATE CAN AND INVEST IN STRATEGIES TO HELP THE COUNTIES IMPROVE. THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR MEETING OUR STATEWIDE GOALS AS WELL AS COUNTY GOALS AND SO -- BECAUSE THE BILL RELEASED LAYS OUT AN AGENDA THAT SAYS HOW CAN WE BEGIN TO WORK WITH A COUNTIES TO UNDERSTAND KEY PRIORITIES BUT PUT THAT STRATEGY IN PLACE AND AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. THE IT AND THIS WAS RATES A LITTLE BIT IN THE ANALYSIS. THAT WE DON'T HAVE A CONCRETE PLAN OF WHAT THE TACKLE SYSTEM TRIED IT WOULD LOOK LIKE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IN MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH THAT WOULD BE IN TERMS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT AND SO WHAT WE APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY ENGAGE WITH THE COUNTIES TO DESIGN A T.. A STRATEGY IT'S GOING TO BE SPECIFIC ON INDIVIDUAL TOPICS AS YOU KNOW AS A PHYSICIAN OF THE VERY DIFFERENT WORKING WITH THE HOSPITAL'S THAN WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS.

THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS THE HIGHEST ASKED MY RATE FOR CHILDREN IN THE NATION OVER FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND VALLEY RESIDENTS HAVE ASMAN OF THOSE A HUNDRED AND FIVE ARE. HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND OUR CHILDREN. ADDITIONALLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS THE HIGHEST RATES OF ER VISITS PER CHILDHOOD ASTHMA IN THE STATE. AND TWENTY SIXTEEN ALMOST 90% OF ALL PEDIATRIC ASTHMA EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS IN CALIFORNIA WERE CHILDREN COVERED BY MEDICARE. MULTIPLE COMMUNITIES LIKE THOSE IN MY DISTRICT NEED BETTER ACCESS TO EFFECTIVE ASTHMA PREVENTION STRATEGIES LIKE AS MY EDUCATION AND ACCESS TO HOME VISITS FROM QUALIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WHO CAN HELP FAMILIES MANAGE THEIR ASTHMA. AND PREVENT ASTHMA ATTACKS. HOME VISITATION FOR PEOPLE WITH POORLY CONTROLLED ASTHMA CAN HELP BOTH MINIMIZE THE RISK OF ASTHMA ATTACKS FOR LOW INCOME. FAMILIES AND HELP REDUCE COSTS TO THE STATE. MEDI CAL SHOULDERS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE ASTHMA BURDEN WITH THE ESTIMATED TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AND ROLLED MEDI CAL WHO HAVE POORLY CONTROLLED ASTHMA.

BUT REDUCING MORE COSTLY MEDICAL USE STUDIES HAVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THESE INTERVENTIONS PROVIDE A RETURN ON INVESTMENT THAT CAN REACH OVER TEN DOLLARS FOR EACH DOLLAR INVESTED. BUT THE NATIONAL ASTHMA CLINICAL GUIDELINES AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL COMMUNITY PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE RECOMMEND THESE SERVICES. MEDICAL BENEFICIARIES OF POORLY CONTROLLED ASTHMA NEED MORE SUPPORT. AND INCREASING ACCESS TO AS A PREVENTIVE SERVICES IN THE HOME IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO PROVIDE THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

LEYVA AYE MITCHELL. MONNING AYE MONNING AYE RUBIO. RUBIO BY. THE BILL HAS SIX BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO GET IT OUT WILL BE HOLDING ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. LET'S MOVE ON TO YOUR NEXT BILL -- ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB. TWO SIXTY THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB TWO SIXTY THE BILL AIMS TO HELP EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS AVOID COVERAGE GAPS WHEN THE UNDERGO LIFE CHANGES THAT TRICKLED LOSSES AND COVERAGE. IN MY DISTRICT ARE FOR COUNTIES FRESNO KERN KEANE'S AND TULARE ALMOST HALF OF MY CONSTITUENTS ARE ON MEDI CAL. MANY OF THEM WILL UNDERGO LIFE EVENTS LIKE GETTING JOBS ARE ANYMORE AT THEIR JOB AT THEIR JOBS WHICH CAN CAUSE THEM TO LOSE MEDICAL COVERAGE AND BECOME. BOND YOU KNOW ELIGIBLE FOR COVER CALIFORNIA. WHEN THIS HAPPENS PEOPLE CAN EXPERIENCE A GAP IN COVERAGE AND IF THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THE AFFORDABLE COVERAGE OPTIONS AVAILABLE? SB TWO SIXTY MAKES IT EASIER FOR CONSUMERS TO GET CONNECTED TO COVERAGE. FIRST THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO TRANSFER LIST OF PEOPLE WHO LOSE COVERAGE FOR ANY REASON TO COVER CALIFORNIA SO COVERED CALIFORNIA CAN DIRECTLY. OUT REACH TO THOSE CONSUMERS AND HELP THEM GET ENROLLED IN A HEALTH PLAN. SECOND THE BILL WOULD ENSURE PEOPLE LEAVING MEDI CAL AND OTHER DH CS ADMINISTER PROGRAMS CAN SEAMLESSLY AND ROLE AND COVERED CALIFORNIA WITHOUT GAPS IN COVERAGE BY AUTO ASSIGNING THEM INTO LOWER COST SOBRE TEAR HEALTH PLANS. AND CORPORATE CALIFORNIA SB TWO SIXTY BUILT UPON THE GREAT WORK THAT OUR STATE HAS ALREADY DONE TO ENSURE CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS. TO AFFORDABLE QUALITY AND COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE IN THE SIMPLEST AND MOST STREAMLINED WAY. CALIFORNIANS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO STRESS OVER FINDING AN AND ROLLING AND YOU COVERAGE AND THEY SHOULD NOT RISKS BEING UNINSURED. SB TWO SIXTY AIMS TO PREVENT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE GAPS PENSION A SMOOTHER TRANSITION BETWEEN MEDI CAL AND COVERED CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLANS. TODAY HAVE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. JUNE AT DS WHAT HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA GEN FLORI WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER DONNA WITNESSES SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAMBERS AND JDS HERE FOR HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA THE SEE WHAT HEALTHCARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION PROUD TO CO SPONSOR SB TWO SIXTY WHICH WOULD ENSURE CALIFORNIANS KEEP THEIR COVERAGE. AND ALSO TO PREVENT THEM FROM. EXPERIENCING GAPS IN COVERAGE WHENEVER DAY EXPERIENCE LIFE EVENTS THAT CAUSE THEM TO ACTUALLY LOSE HEALTH INSURANCE. EVERYDAY WHENEVER CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE LIFE EVENTS LIKE LOSING THEIR JOBS CHANGING JOBS. BECOMING A WIDOW GETTING MARRIED OR EVEN TURNING THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX THAT COULD TRIGGER A LOSS AND HEALTH INSURANCE WHICH COULD THEN TRIGGER A COVERAGE GAP. SB TWO SIXTY BILLS ON EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW THE ALREADY REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO PROVIDE A NOTICE TO CONSUMERS OF AVAILABILITY OF COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICARE ALL OF OUR COVER CALIFORNIA. REGARDLESS OF THEREASON AS TO WHY THEY LOST THE COVERAGE. SENDING A NOTICE IS A GOOD FIRST STEP BUT SB TWO SIXTY TAKES OF STEP FURTHER BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR COVER CALIFORNIA TO ENGAGE WITH THOSE CONSUMERS. EDUCATE THEM ABOUT THEIR PLAN OPTIONS AND ALSO POTENTIAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA. AND AS WELL AS HOW THEY CAN ENROLL IN THAT COVERAGE. FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT SB TWO SIXTY AND NOW ALL NOW TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEGE AND FOR A WHOLE TALK ABOUT THE MEDI CAL TO COVER CALIFORNIA TRANSITIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN FLOORS WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- THAT PART IN FROM MOVING FROM MEDICAID TO COVER CALIFORNIA SLIGHTLY MORE TECHNICAL -- AS SOME OF YOU RECALL THE SOME OF THE EARLIEST IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH SOME OF YOU WERE INVOLVED IN. WE ENVISIONED A SYSTEM WHERE A SUBSIDIZED HEALTH PROGRAMS WOULD BE LINKED SUCH THAT WHEN SOMEONE WAS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR ONE PROGRAM THEY WOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY EVALUATED FOR THE OTHER AVAILABLE PROGRAM SO THEY COULD AND I QUOTE. MOVE BETWEEN PROGRAMS WITHOUT ANY BREAKS IN COVERAGE AND WITHOUT BEING REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ANY FORMS DOCUMENTS OR OTHER INFORMATION OR UNDERGO VERIFICATION THAT'S DUPLICATIVE OR OTHERWISE UNNECESSARY. THIS IS THE CURRENT LAW. MOST OF THIS IS WORKING WHEN SOMEONE'S INCOME GOES UP SUCH A THEY ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL THE COUNTY ELIGIBILITY WORKERS DO INDEED DETERMINE IF THAT PERSON IS ELIGIBLE FOR COVER CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION. THEY PUT THAT PERSON IN THE ELIGIBILITY SYSTEM IN THE COVER CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. THE COULD THE ELIGIBILITY SYSTEM CAL HERE'S KNOWS WHAT THEIR INCOME IS AND KNOWS HOW MUCH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ARE AVAILABLE. FOR HOWEVER BECAUSE OF HOW THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS INVOLVING PLAN SELECTION OVERLAY WITH OUR STATE LAW REGARDING TIMELY NOTICE WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE PEOPLE LOSING THEIR MEDI CAL OFTEN HAVE LESS THAN TEN DAYS INCLUDING WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS. TO AFFIRMATIVELY SELECT A PLAN OR THEY WILL FACE A GAP IN COVERAGE OF AT LEAST A MONTH. PLAN SELECTION MAY NOT SEEM LIKE AN INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER BUT PEOPLE OFTEN DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO GET HELP OR UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY MUST DO TO EFFECTUATE THEIR COVERAGE. PROVIDER NETWORKS BETWEEN MEDI CAL AND COVER CALIFORNIA DON'T ALWAYS MATCH. SADLY WE HAVE ALSO SEEN A NUMBER OF CONSUMERS WHO ENDED UP IN THE E. R. DURING THAT GAP PERIOD AND CURRENT MEDICAL BILLS THAT THEY COULDN'T PAY. SOME OF THEM HAD ALREADY ENROLLED IN COVER CALIFORNIA BUT THEIR COVERAGE WOULDN'T BE EFFECTIVE TILL THE NEXT MONTH. SB TO SIXTY IS MERELY THE TECHNICAL FIX IT THREADS THE NEEDLE BETWEEN THE STATE AND FEDERAL LAW BY SPLITTING UP THE ENROLLMENT DAY IN A PLAN TO AVOID THE GAP IN COVERAGE AND EFFECTUATE IN OUR PAYMENT DATE. TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE TIME TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR THEM AS AS PERMITTED BY FEDERAL LAW. SB TWO SIXTY REQUIRES COVER CALIFORNIA TO ENROLL EOPLE COMING FROM MEDI CAL INTO THE CHEAPEST SOBRE PLAN AS A PLACE HOLDER TO AVOID THE GAP IN COVERAGE. THEY WILL THEN SEND A NOTICE TELLING PEOPLE IF THEY LIKE THE PLAN HAS BEEN THAT HAS BEEN CHOSEN WHEN THEIR PAYMENT IS DUE. IF THEY DON'T WANT THAT PLAN THEY CAN USE THE REMAINDER OF THEIR SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD TO CHANGE TO A DIFFERENT PLAN OR IF THEY PREFER NOT PAY AND NOT ENROLL IN ANYTHING AT ALL. THIS BUILDS ON A SYSTEM THAT COVERED CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY USED TO HELP PEOPLE RENEW WHEN THEIR CURRENT PLAN IS NOT AVAILABLE. CONSUMERS WILL STILL HAVE ALL OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM TODAY BUT THE DEFAULT WILL BE THE T. CHEAPEST PLAN WITH THE MOST FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN COVER CALIFORNIA ARE NOT ONLY GETTING PREMIUM ASSISTANCE. BUT THERE ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR THE ADDITIONAL OUT OF POCKET AND IT'S PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING OUT OF THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM THAT NEED ALL OF THIS ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE TO THEM. WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN THIS ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU -- WITNESSES SUPPORT BACK MIKE FROM -- FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT.

OF WITNESSES OPPOSITION -- ACTUALLY A MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A SUPPORT OR OPPOSE POSITION ON THE BILL. WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR ABOUT THE INTENT OF THE BILL WE THINK IT'S LAUDABLE -- AVOIDING COVERAGE GAPS COULD ACTUALLY HELP THE MARKET AS WELL AS CONSUMERS. SO I WOULD LIKE TO WORK OUT OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OPERATIONAL ISSUES -- AND THERE'S ONE COMPONENT OF THE BILL THAT WE BELIEVE UNNECESSARILY INCREASES THE ADMINISTRATIVE LOAD ON PLANNED SO -- WE'VE HAD A GOOD FIRST CONVERSATION WE HOPE TO CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE AND AND TRY TO RESOLVE IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHTS AT SAYING NO OTHER WITNESS ANY WITNESS OPPOSITION SEEING NONE QUESTIONS FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND DAY HERE AT DOUBLE MOTION I CAME IN FIGURE WHO WAS FIRST SO. OKAY WELL IT THE SENSOR RUBIO OF THE SECOND ALL RIGHT.

AND NIGHT AND I STONE. STONE ONLINE DORADO. GROWTH HER TADO. A TOTAL AYE LEYVA. LEYVA AYE MITCHELL. MONNING THANK MONNING AYE RUBIO. RUBIO I THE BILL AS FIVE IT'S ENOUGH TO GET OUT BUT WILL HOLD IT OPEN FOR ABOUT SIX MINUTES OKAY SO DEFINITELY ENOUGH TO GET OUT BUT WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. AND FINALLY WE HAVE -- SEE ITEM NUMBER SIX SB [inaudible] THREE THIRTY ONE RIGHT. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN I AM HERE TO PRESENT SB THREE THREE ONE WHICH WILL REQUIRE ALL CALIFORNIA COUNTIES TO DEVELOP A SUICIDE PREVENTION STRATEGIC PLAN. WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ADOLESCENCE. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED A CONSTANT RISE AND DEATHS BY SUICIDE. ALARMINGLY YOUTH SUICIDE AND SELF INFLICTED INJURY ARE ON THE RISE. AND IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG YOUTH AGES FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR IN THE U. S.. IN CALIFORNIA ALMOST 20% OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED ATTEMPTING SUICIDE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. ALMOST ONE HALF 49% OF LGBTQ STUDENTS REPORTED SUICIDAL THOUGHTS MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE ESTIMATE FOR THEIR ST PEERS. AND FRESNO COUNTY ALONE FOR EACH TEEN WHO DIES BY SUICIDE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY YOUTH WERE TREATED IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOLLOWING. SELF INJURY. AND MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND ADOLESCENTS THOUGHT SERIOUSLY ABOUT AND IN THEIR LIVES. AND FOR YOUNG WOMAN SUICIDE RATES AMONG TEENAGE GIRLS HAVE HAD A FORTY YEAR HIGH. STUDIES SHOW THAT PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION EFFORTS CAN HELP AVOID A SUICIDAL CRISIS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN CONVENING STAKEHOLDERS FROM PAPER SECTORS LIKE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HEALTH CARE YOUTH JUSTICE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMUNITY ORGANIZING TO HELP FORM STRATEGIC PREVENTION ORIENTED PLANS. WHEN COUNTIES IMPLEMENT STRATEGIC SUICIDE PREVENTION PLANS THE RESULT IN FEWER SUICIDE DEATHS AND THEIR COUNTY? FOR EXAMPLE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY WHICH HAS HAD A CONCERTED SUICIDE PREVENTION EFFORTS SINCE. TWENTY TEN HAS SEEN A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN SUICIDE DEATHS. HOWEVER SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE ONLY SEVEN OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE ADOPTED SUICIDE PREVENTION STRATEGIC PLANS. MORE PROACTIVE ACTION IS NEEDED TO HELP ADDRESS SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR AND PREVENT TEEN SUICIDE. INCLUDE ANY PARTICULAR FOCUS ON SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE YOUTH. SB THREE THREE ONE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIA COUNTIES ARE TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS TO HELP PREVENT TEEN SUICIDE. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME AGING SHELTON WITH THE STATE BURKE INSTITUTE TEND TO FORMER SANTA CLARA COUNTY SUPERVISOR VIC. THE DOCUMENT SIDE. OKAY CLOSE OKAY TO TESTIFY ON SB THREE THREE ONE THANK YOU HE CENTER TADA WITNESSES SUPPORT GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ADRIN SHELTON WITH THE STEINBERG AND CITY WE ARE THE PROUD SPONSOR OF SENATE BILL. THREE THREE ONE SB THREE THREE ONE PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK TO COORDINATE SUICIDE PREVENTION EFFORTS AND EXPAND UPON THEM. WE BELIEVE AS A STATE WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE PROACTIVE AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO REVERSE THIS ALARMING INCREASE IN SUICIDES. ACCORDING TO RECENT DATA FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR'S SUICIDES IN THE U. S. ROSE BY 33% FROM. NINETEEN NINETY NINE TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN NEARLY FORTY THREE HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS DIED BY SUICIDE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THIS IS A 50% INCREASE FROM. TWO THOUSAND ONE THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE LATEST FIGURES FROM THE US CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND FOR PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTY FIVE SUICIDE IS THE SECOND. LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOLLOWING UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES. SB THREE THREE ONE REQUIRES THAT ALL CALIFORNIA COUNTIES HAVE THE SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN. FORMING A COUNTY SUICIDE PREVENTION TASKFORCE AND WRITING A SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN CAN HELP IN IDENTIFYING GAPS WERE MISSING ACTIONS AND BETTER PROMOTE AND COMMUNICATE SUICIDE PREVENTION ACTIONS. COUNTIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED SUICIDE PREVENTION PLANS HAVE REPORTED TO US BUT THE PLANS HAVE HELPED THEM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND SUICIDE IN THEIR COUNTIES. TO HELP GET BETTER GUIDE COUNTY EFFORTS DONE IF I GOALS AND BE ABLE TO MEASURE PROGRESS. WE BELIEVE THIS FRAMEWORK AND SB THREE THREE ONE WHICH REQUIRES A MULTIFACETED APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM WILL SUPPORT OUR STATE AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST SUICIDE. AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. SO FOR THE RECORD I'M VICO JACKIE AND I MANY FORMER PALO ALTO CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AND MAYOR. WHEN I WAS IN OFFICE ONE OF MY CHILDREN KILLED HIMSELF? STILL NOT EASY TO SAY -- BUT I ALSO LIVE IN A CITY THAT IF SOME OF YOU KNOW WE'VE EXPERIENCED TO TEEN SUICIDE CLUSTERS. SO I'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS -- NATIONALLY IN THIS STATE REGIONALLY IN IN MY LOCAL AREA ABOUT SUICIDE PREVENTION. BUT THIS BILL I THINK IS ONE OF THOSE SEMINAL BILLS AND WHY DO I THINK THAT BECAUSE A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE SOME LEGISLATION PASSED. IN THIS. THIS CAPITAL IS FOCUSED ON PARTICULAR ON GROUPS ARE PROFESSIONS AND SOME SPECIFIC ACTIONS THIS ONE'S A MORE PERVASIVE ACTION WILL AFFECT THE WHOLE STATE. ON THE AND IF. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE STATE WILL LET ME STEP BACK FOR SECOND. FROM IF YOU DIDN'T GET MY LETTER. A LEAVE COPIES HERE. EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME. TOM SOME YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN THIS ARTICLE IT SHOWS THAT. A LIFE EXPECTANCY IN THE UNITED STATES IS GOING DOWN WHY IS IT GOING DOWN BESIDES DRUG USE IT'S SO SITES. ARE CAUSING THAT TO HAPPEN. IS IT A PROBLEM THAT CALIFORNIANS. HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS REPORT THAT CAME OUT IN TWENTY ELEVEN SAID THAT AT LEAST FIFTY ONE POINT 2% OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE HAD THEIR LIVES IMPACTED BY A SUICIDE. IT'S THE MAJORITY NOT THE MINORITY. WHAT DOES THIS DOCUMENT CHAU? IT SHOWS THE FIRST PAGE SHOWS SUICIDE DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S THIS. IT'S GOING UP EVERY YEAR AND HAS BEEN. IN THIS CASE FOR THE TEN YEARS -- SHOW. TO COMPARE THAT WITH. WITH -- HOMICIDES. THE CALIFORNIA IT'S DOUBLE. WE HAVE A FAR BIGGER PROBLEM WITH SUICIDE CAN WE DO WITH HOMICIDES -- IN THIS IS FOR THE REASON WHY WE WANT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WE THINK THAT. IT'S IT PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED FRANKLY A LONG TIME AGO -- I TOOK AN OATH -- I HAD A SAYING THAT WAS CONSTANTLY I HAD TO LOOK AT WHEN I WAS VOTING ON LEGISLATION LIKE YOU AND IT SAID I HAD TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT MY RESIDENTS HEALTH. WELFARE AND SAFETY EVERY COUNTY HAS SEVERAL SPOTS ABILITY FOR THE THE RESIDENTS EVEN IF THEY WANT TO SAY THAT THEY DON'T BECAUSE IF THEY WANT TO SAVE IT SUICIDE. ISN'T THERE -- RESPONSIBILITY -- IN SUPPORT OF CENTER HURT HER TODD DOES COMMENTS. WHAT'S THIS CHART IT SHOWS THE LAST TEN YEARS OF YOUTH DEATH. IN CALIFORNIA WHAT DID CHAU IT SHOWS THE LAST THREE YEARS THOSE NUMBERS ARE GOING UP UP UP INCLUDING THE LAST REPORTABLE YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS THE HIGHEST YEAR. MAYBE THE HIGHEST YEAR WE'VE HAD BUT IT'S THE HIGHEST THE LAST TEN YEARS. ONE OF THESE LAST. TWO PAGES SHOW WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THEM. IT SHOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY WHERE I CO CHAIR. THAT EFFORT ON OUR DESKS ARE GOING DOWN INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH SO YOU GOT NE THING GOING LIKE THIS AND THE OTHER ONE GOING LIKE THIS. SO IT SHOWS THAT DOING THIS TYPE OF WORK IF IT'S PERVASIVE AND IF PEOPLE -- CAN STRUCTURE CULTURE BUT YOU CAN HAVE AN IMPACT. THIS REPORT CARD ISSUED ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO IT'S FROM. CALIFORNIA -- DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN IT'S CALLED PREVENTING VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT'S IT SAY WELL ONE OF THINGS IT SAYS FIRST OF ALL I GUESS TO THE CREDIT OF WHAT WE'VE DONE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY IT SHOWS US IS HAVING THE FAR LOWEST RATE OF ANY COUNTY. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO SHOWS AGAIN THAT THERE WERE TWICE AS MANY SUICIDES TO HOMICIDES IN THIS STATE. IN THEY HAVE AN INTERESTING -- FACT THAT THEY CITING HERE AND THAT IS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT THE COST OF DOING SOME OF THIS WORK. THE SHOW THAT OF THE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS SPENT ANNUALLY ON VIOLENCE -- DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA FOUR POINT NINE BILLION OF THAT IS. DEALING WITH SUICIDES. IT'S THE LARGER NUMBER YEAH AND THERE'S AN ABILITY TO SAVE MONEY FOR A COUNTY BY PUTTING THIS PLAN IN PLACE I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE THIS DOCUMENT. YEAH BUT I QUICKLY PUT TOGETHER THIS A RESOURCE LIST IT IT DOESN'T PUT IN ALL OF THE TYPICAL THINGS JUST TOOL KITS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OUT THERE ALL FREE. BEYOND ANYBODY CAN TAKE SOME OF THESE AND IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM. SO WITH THAT I HOPE YOU SUPPORT -- SB THREE THIRTY ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES A SUPPORT. MY SECOND FALLS ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS AND A PREVIOUS CITIZEN WHO GREW UP IN FRESNO STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. HI MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MICHAEL RIGHT AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF SANTA CLARA HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. MADELINE COOPER ON BEHALF OF MARIN COUNTY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT QUESTION COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL -- I WANNA ALSO A PRE SEE OUT THERE FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- I KNOW AS AN EDUCATOR IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT I TODD YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN A SPIKE IN IN NOW SUICIDE AND ATTEMPTED SUICIDE AND AS A COUNCIL MEMBER YOU KNOW OUT NOT SO LONG AGO WE HAD TO RESPOND. TO A MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARK IN OUR CHILDREN WALKING BY GOING TO SCHOOL AND WHO HAD TO WITNESS YOU KNOW A TRAGEDY BUT SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US SOME TENNIS YOU KNOW I WORRY ALSO THE LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBER OR LOCAL LEADER IT YOU KNOW. THE INITIAL THING WE'RE ALWAYS THINKING OF HOW TO IMPLEMENTED COST AND AND I KNOW YOU MENTIONED SEVEN OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ALREADY. BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAM AND I YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST A A SOMETHING THAT I WOULD. ASK THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER MAYBE HAVING A SHARED. WEBSITE OR OR SOMEWHERE WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THESE COUNTIES HAVE ACCESS TO THESE PLANS THAT ALREADY WORK THERE ALREADY IN PRACTICE CELL. THEY DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL AND IT DOESN'T SEEM SOUL -- CUMBERSOME TED TO PUT IN PLACE SO I DO STRONGLY SUPPORT THAT AND BUT THAT I'M WITH THE BILL. THANKS THEIR MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ELSE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN. TO THE LOSS SIR AND APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO TRYING TO PROTECT OTHER FAMILIES FROM. SUFFERING SIMILAR TRAGEDIES. FOR ANY OF YOU I GUESS THE QUESTION BECOMES WITH THESE TRENDS THAT CONTINUE TO GO UP PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. WHAT DO WE UNDER SUPPORT PUTS THE COURSEWARE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE? TURNING TO SUICIDE. AN OUNCE MULTI FACTOR OWN MAYBE NOT AN EASY QUESTION TO ANSWER BUT WE'RE LIVING IN TROUBLED TIMES THERE'S LOTS OF PRESSURES OUT THERE ON ALL FRONTS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IN YOUR RESEARCHER. IF YOU'RE SEEING ANY TRENDS SIR. COP ABILITIES THAT LEAD TO THIS. SO THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER -- EVEN IN SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE DO IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY WITH VARIOUS AGE GROUPS IT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO ANSWER -- THE WHAT WE TRIED TO DO WAS WHOLE FOCUS GROUP MEETINGS. I'M USING A THIRD PARTY PROFESSIONAL TO CALL OUT FROM PEOPLE WHAT'S GOING ON WE SAW A BIG EFFECT WITH THAT WHEN WE DID IT WITH -- MIDDLE AGED WHITE ADULTS WHICH ARE THE GOOD WHICH IS THE CATEGORY THE MOST TAKES THEIR LIVES -- WE SAW SIGNIFICANT -- HOW COME FROM THAT? SO THERE'S A LOT OF I'LL CALL IT SPECULATION IT'S BEEN GIVEN ABOUT WHY. YOUNG PEOPLE TAKE THEIR LIVES -- MY PREFERENCES AND DO WHAT WE DID IN OUR COUNTY -- A GROUP OF PEOPLE LED BY SOME FOLKS FROM STANFORD -- DEVELOPED A TOOL KIT IT'S CALLED THE K. THROUGH TWELVE TO SUB PREVENTION TOOL KIT AND THEY GO OUT FOR FREE. THE END OF WORKING SCHOOLS TO TRY AND REDUCE SUICIDE CREATE. ONE AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'RE DOING IN THE SUCCESS. SHOWN IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY WE DO NEED TO REPLICATE THIS STATEWIDE AND NATIONALLY. I MEAN THE TRAGEDIES OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS RELATED TO MASH SHOOTINGS. THE PARENT OF ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN SANDY HOOK I THINK A CLASSMATE FROM PARKLAND -- WERE LIVING IN A THE NEW ABNORMAL IN THIS COUNTRY OF VIOLENCE IN PRESSURES. I'M ALSO READ OF THE CYBER BULLING OF YOUNG PEOPLE. IN YOU MAY KNOW OF THIS THERE'S A YOUNG MAN WHO'S DEVELOPED AN APP. FOR PEOPLE TO GO TO WHO ARE. TROUBLED MOM. CAN I DON'T HAVE MORE DETAILS BUT IS SOMETHING WE CAN PROBABLY GET HE'S A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT AND I THINK THEY LOST SOMEBODY IN THEIR HIGH SCHOOL. IN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE DEVELOPED AN APPLICATION THAT NOW ANYBODY CAN DOWNLOAD ON THEIR PHONE SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING ELSE WE COULD HELP. POPULAR RISES THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU IN THAT THE PROGRAMMATIC. BE. GLAD TO MOVE THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU I THINK OF A TWO PEOPLE MOVING IT ALREADY -- THANK YOU I IT'S FIVE SAID FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FOR PRESENTING AND FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL STORY AND NINE OF SAID AT A CAN'T SAY I KNOW BUT I'D. I UNDERSTAND HOW THAT THAT IT'S DIFFICULT AND I APPRECIATE YOU SO WE COME HERE TO SHARE THAT -- AND THANK YOU CENTER DOT OF FOR BRING THIS BILL FORD -- DEAL SUICIDE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH ACTUALLY WE TALK ABOUT TEENS -- THAT'S AT THE TOP AND SO WITH THAT -- THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY BOTH CENTERS RUBIO AND MINING -- WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. OKAY THANK YOU. SO -- THE MOTIONS TO PASS APPROPRIATIONS BILLS BEEN -- MOVED -- BY CENTERS RUBIO AND MINING SECTORS THIS CALL THE ROLL.

MONNING THANK MONNING AYE RUBIO I THE LAST SIX VOTE SO WILL THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THAT'S ENOUGH TO GET OUT. SIR SONY READY. OKAY SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER TWELVE SB FIVE NINETY I CENTER STONE [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR. WHAT TIME IS A? FOUR FIFTEEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT SB FIVE NINETY I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IS A MAJOR PART OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN LIFE HOWEVER ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE AND ABUSE IMPOSES AN ENORMOUS BURDEN ON INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND OUR STATE. ALCOHOL ABUSE HAVE SERIOUS MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE HYPERTENSION DIABETES LIVER DISEASE FEEL ABNORMALITIES AND CANCER. AND UNITED STATES ABOUT 5% OF ALL DEATHS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO ALCOHOL MISUSE. IT IS ALSO ESTIMATED THAT A WHOPPING A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR POINT SIX BILLION IS SPENT EVERY YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES ON ALCOHOL RELATED RELATED ILLNESSES. HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES MOTOR VEHICLE CRASHES CRIME AND OTHER SOCIAL COSTS MORE CLOSE TO HOME IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ABOUT EITHER BINGE DRINKING OR CHRONIC DRINKING. SB FIVE NINETY PROVIDES JUST ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO TRY TO HELP THOSE WHO SUFFER WITH CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM. THIS BILL AMENDS A LANTERN MEN PATRICK SHORT ACT TO INCLUDE THOSE SUFFERING FROM ALCOHOLISM IN THE EXISTING SCREENING PROCESS. THIS INCLUSION WOULD THEREFORE ALLOW ANY PERSON INCLUDING A PARENT SIBLING OR SPOUSE TO PETITION A COUNTY DESIGNATED ENTITY TO HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL OR A LOVED. ONE WHO IS SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR TO OTHERS OR IS GRAVELY DISABLED TO BE SCREENED AND APPROPRIATELY ASSESSED. THIS A VIOLATION WITH US INITIATE A FIFTY ONE FIFTY AND TENS OF TREATMENT OR CONSERVATORSHIP IF NECESSARY. SB FIVE NINETY IS A SMALL CHANGE IN AN ALREADY EXISTING FRAMEWORK OF THE LAW. TO GIVE HOPE TO INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES WERE SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM. SB FIVE NINETY GIVES HOPE TO SAVE ONE MORE LIFE WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR HEIGHT BOAT. THANK YOU CENTER STONE -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESS SUPPORT ALL RIGHT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. NONE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

AND CENTER STONE I THINK -- AS SINCE THE SENATE MITCHELL ISN'T. WILL BE RETURNING LE LATER A HAND THE GAVEL TO YOU AND I HAVE TO BILLS TO PRESENT [inaudible] FOUR THREE WELCOME MISTER CHAIRMAN I I ASSUME YOU WANT TO TAKE THESE AND FILE ORDER SPCS CORRECTLY THANK YOU. WITH PERCY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- SB THREE FORTY THREE IS A BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL HEALTH PLANS AND HOSPITALS HAVE TO PLAY BY THE SAME RULES AND DOES SO BY REMOVING EXEMPTIONS AND THE LAW THAT ALLOW KAISER PERMANENTE A TO REPORT. LESS INFORMATION TO REGULATORS AND OTHER HEALTH PLANS AND HOSPITALS. TRANSPARENCY LAWS LIKE RATE REVIEW AND HOSPITALS -- FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES WERE COME CREATED TO HELP PURCHASERS AND REGULATORS MANTRA COSTS THAT DRIVE HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM RATES. ALL OTHER HEALTH PLANS IN CALIFORNIA ARE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE WHAT THEY EXPECT. WHAT THEY CALL THE MEDICAL TREND FACTOR OR THE INCREASING COSTS THAT WILL BE FOR THE NEXT PLAN YEAR? THESE ARE HOWEVER DOESN'T NEED THE PROJECT AHEAD FOR COSTS IN THE COMING YEAR WHICH IS WHAT PREMIUM INCREASES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BASED ON INSTEAD -- KAISER EARLY REPORTS REPORTS WHAT THE COST EXPERIENCE WAS IN THE PAST YEAR SO THEY'RE JUST TELLING US WHAT HAPPENED DID NOT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT YET OTHER EVERY OTHER HEALTH PLAN HAS TO DO THAT. MORE SIGNIFICANTLY KAISER ALSO DOESN'T BREAK OUT PRICES BY CATEGORY LIKE OTHER ALL OTHER HEALTH PLANS REQUIRED TO DO. AND SO WHERE US OTHER PLANTS. REPORT -- THE EXPECTED PRICE INCREASE FOR HOSPITAL INPATIENT HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT PHYSICIAN SERVICES PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGY KAISER LUMPS ALMOST ALL OF THAT INTO A SINGLE HOSPITAL INPATIENT NUMBER. WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IS THE ONLY OTHER CATEGORY REPORTED SEPARATELY. WITH REGARD TO HOSPITAL REPORTING COSTS CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE REQUIRED TO INDIVIDUAL HOSPITAL. EYES ARE ON THE OTHER HAND REPORTS THESE FINANCIAL FIGURES FOR ALL OF ITS NORTHERN OR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS IN AGATE SO YOU GET A NUMBER FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND A NUMBER FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE CERTAINLY KNOW HEISER HAS MANY FACILITIES -- WITHIN EACH. NOW. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND KAISER'S LEVEL DIFFERENCE. BUT THIS SPECIAL TREATMENT OBSCURES IMPORTANT NOBLE KNOWLEDGE -- ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON TO A VERY SIGNIFICANT PLAYER IN THE HEALTHCARE MARKET HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT ALSO DOES PROVIDE CERTAIN ADVANTAGES THE KAISER AND PREVENTS OUR LAWS FROM BEING IMPLEMENTED AS THEIR INTENDED. SO AS I MENTIONED AT KAISER REPRESENTS ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS MORE THAN 40% OF INSURED CALIFORNIANS WITH THE COMMERCIAL COVERAGE. SO THIS BECOMES AN INFORMATION GAP THAT MEANS THAT STATE REGULATORS LACTAID ON THE SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR HEALTH CARE MARKET. AND AS HEALTHCARE COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE POLICY MAKERS PURCHASERS AND CONSUMERS NEED ACCESS TO THE SAME INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS DRIVING COST INCREASES THAT KAISER'S THEY DO AT EVERY OTHER HOSPITAL AND HEALTH PLAN. AND SO I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE THAT -- WE WANT TO WORK WITH KAISER. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THE KIND OF INFORMATION AT THE RIGHT KIND OF GRANULARITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND SO MANY WAYS -- WELL KAISER CERTAINLY WILL BE. EXPLAINING WHY THEY'RE OPPOSED -- I WOULD POINT OUT ITS BECAUSE KAISER SO IMPORTANT AND THEY DO SUCH IMPORTANT WORK THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON SO I HAVE WITH ME MICHELLE COMPARE WITH SCA YOU CALIFORNIANS SPONSORED THIS BILL TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MICHELLE GOT IT I WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION AND AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS HEALTHCARE COSTS CONTINUED TO OUTPACE WAGES AND INFLATION. AND PUT A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON WORKERS. WE REPRESENT WORKERS FROM BOTH ACT HEISER AND ALSO NUMEROUS KAISER MEMBERS IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTORS. AND ARE SPONSORING SB THREE FORTY SIX THREE FORTY THREE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT ALL INSURERS AND HEALTH PLANS. AND HOSPITALS NEED TO BE ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HEALTH CARE COST DRIVERS. AT THIS POINT KAISER HAS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO A TRANSPARENCY WITH RESPECT TO OTHER PLANS AND ALSO VIS A VIS LARGE PURCHASERS WHO HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH KAISER FOR THEIR RATES -- TODAY'S LARGE GROUP RATE REVIEW REPORTING SCHEME IS ACTUALLY PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD AND I WOULD LOVE TO DEMYSTIFY IT INSURERS ROLL ALL OF THEIR COSTS UP INTO A SINGLE AGGREGATED. RATE FOR THE ENTIRE STATE IN THE LARGE GROUP MARKET AND AS DOCTOR PAN MENTIONED THEY HAVE THEIR REQUIRED BY LAW TO BREAK IT OUT IN SIX CATEGORIES INCLUDING. WHAT HOUSE PHYSICIANS -- KEMP ARE A COMPONENT OF THEIR RATE HOW. INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THEN ALSO LAB IN RADIOLOGY THAT'S IT FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ROLL ALL OF THAT UP INTO ONE NUMBER. AND KAISER HAS NOT DONE THAT FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT WE'VE HAD LARGE GROUP RATE REVIEW IN CALIFORNIA -- TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S DRIVING IN THE RATE INCREASES FOR FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS OVER THE LAST. THREE YEARS IS REALLY IMPORTANT EVERY YEAR YEAR OVER YEAR THOSE RATE INCREASES ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY HAVE SUBMITTED ARE BASED ENTIRELY ON COSTS GOING UP NOT ON ANY FACTOR OF UTILIZATION AMONG KAISER'S MEMBERS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS LEGISLATION WILL ALLOW US TO UNCOVER WHAT'S DRIVING THOSE RATE INCREASES. THERE ARE ALSO OTHER INTEGRATED HEALTH PLANS IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE OTHER EXAMPLES WHERE INSURERS WHO ARE ALIGNED WITH THEIR PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE STATE AT TO THE REGULATORS. WE'VE ALREADY GIVING KAISER SOME LATITUDE TO DO ITS BEST GIVEN ITS INTEGRATED MODEL TO MEET THE SAME STANDARDS AS THOSE OTHER INSURERS. AND WHAT THEY'VE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IS SHIRKING THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND A CLEANING AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY VALUED -- TRANSPARENCY THIS IS NO SMALL MATTER -- ALTHOUGH THERE 40% OF ALL INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA THEY'RE 65% OF THE LARGE GROUP MARKET WHICH IS A HUGE CHUNK TO HAVE MISSING I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY REPORTS I'VE READ. WHETHER IT'S HEALTH AFFAIRS ARTICLES OR CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION REPORTS THAT HAVE THE ASTERIX THAT SAYS. THIS IS A REPORT ON HEALTHCARE COSTSIN CALIFORNIA. EXCEPT FOR KAISER AND GIVEN HOW DOMINANT THEY ARE THAT'S A HUGE HOLE THERE IN EIGHTY BILLION DOLLAR ORGANIZATION WITH THIRTY ONE HOSPITALS THEY MUST HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUCH. THESE COMPONENTS ARE COSTING AND BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW -- THE HOUSE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE PRICES AND AND AND BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THEM -- BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO REPORT THESE FINANCIAL DATA WE HAVE NO IDEA IF THEY'RE SERVING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF MEDIC HOW PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T KNOW -- WHETHER OR NOT IT AT THE REGULATE A LEVER LEVEL THERE APPROPRIATELY MEETING THEIR MEDICAL LOSS RATIO STANDARDS AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BEHIND ALL OF THIS SO FOR ALL THESE RECENT REASONS WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB THREE FORTY THREE TO SHINE A LIGHT. ON KAISER'S COST DRIVERS AND INCREASING INSURANCE RATES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. LOW. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS YES MEAN PILOT FOR HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB. THREE FORTY THREE MEMBERS HEALTH ACCESS WAS THE SPONSOR OF THE ORIGINAL RATE REVIEW LEGISLATION WHICH SB THREE FORTY THREE A MAN'S WE DRAFTED THE SENTENCE THAT REQUIRES KAISER TO DISCLOSE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE USING BENEFIT CATEGORIES THAT ARE SIMILAR. TO THOSE USED BY OTHER PLANS IN OUR VIEW KAISER HAS IGNORED THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS LAW AND THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT. THE RATE REVIEW LAW REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS TO SAY HOW MUCH THEY SPEND ON TEN CATEGORIES PHYSICIAN SERVICES INPATIENT HOSPITAL CARE OUTPATIENT EMERGENCY CARE LABS IN IMAGING. MEMBERS DOES KAISER KNOW HOW MUCH POSITIONS POSITION SERVICES COST SEPARATED OUT FROM HOSPITAL SERVICES DO THEY HAVE A BUDGET FOR THE COMPANY THAT SEPARATES LAB SERVICES FROM X. RAYS AND CAT SCANS MRI AND OTHER IMAGING COSTS. HOW ARE THEY PROVIDING CARE TO ALMOST NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS IF THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY SPEND ON DOCTORS COMPARED TO HOSPITALS? WE KNOW FROM OUR WORK ON OTHER RATE REVIEW BILLS THAT KAISER PROVIDES LARGE PURCHASERS MUCH MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON UNIT COSTS AND UTILIZATION FOR TYPES OF CARE. AND THEY DO IT QUARTERLY YET IN THEIR RATE FILINGS KAISER SAYS THEY CANNOT PUBLICLY EXPLAIN WHAT THEY SPEND ON DOCTORS HOSPITALS LABORATORIES AND IMAGING. AND THEY POINT TO THE SENTENCE THAT SB THREE FORTY THREE DELETES AS THE REASON THAT THE LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE THEM. TO THAT IS NOT WHAT THE SENTENCE SAYS T IS NOT WHAT IT MEANT THE FAILURE OF THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION TO ENFORCE THE LAW AS WRITTEN IS NO EXCUSE. KAISER IS A MAJOR PART OF OUR HEALTH SYSTEM YET THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME REVIEW AS OTHER HEALTH PLANS. THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE CANNOT DETERMINE WHETHER KAISER. KAISER IS RATES ARE REASONABLE OR JUSTIFIED BECAUSE KAISER REFUSES TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THE LAW REQUIRES. WE SUPPORT SB THREE FORTY THREE BECAUSE IT DILUTES THE SENTENCE THE KAISER HAS USED AS AN EXCUSE FOR AVOIDING COMPLIANCE WITH RATE REVIEW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WILL NOW HEAR FROM OTHER OPPONENTS IF YOU LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO AMEND WE'D APPRECIATE IT [inaudible] FOR MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CALIFORNIA'S THEIR FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN STRONG SUPPORT.

THANK YOU YOU HAVE SOME. I'D LIKE TO CALL OF THE OPPONENTS OF THE PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] WELCOME [inaudible] THAT. BY THAT ONE AND THEN IT WOULD NOT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. THERESA START WITH KAISER PERMANENTE A AND WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL WE HAVE HAD -- A COUPLE OF OF LENGTHY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SENATOR AND AND WE WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THAT COMMUNICATION UNFORTUNATELY WE DO. I STILL HAVE STRONG CONCERNS WITH THE MEASURE AND AS YOU'VE HEARD OF THE BILL DOES ONLY IMPACT KAISER PERMANENTE NAY. AND WHILE WE ARE ALWAYS GLAD TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT OUR FIGURE UNIQUE HIGH QUALITY INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEM -- WE DO FEEL THIS BILL IS IS MISGUIDED AND SHORT SIGHTED. I DO WANT TO CORRECT -- SEVERAL ACTUALLY MIS CHARACTERIZATIONS ABOUT ABOUT CURRENT LAW IN THE BILL IT IS IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WE ARE NOT EXEMPT -- FROM EITHER OF THE LAWS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THIS MEASURE AND ALL ALL EXPLAIN THAT MORE THERE ARE. NO EXEMPTIONS NO EXCEPTIONS -- AND AND THE CHARACTERIZATION THAT KAISER IS NOT THAT DIFFERENT ANYMORE -- IS ACTUALLY IT COULDN'T BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH -- AND REALLY I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY THE FATAL FLAW WITH THE BILL -- KAISER PERMANENTE A I'M STILL IS VERY UNIQUE -- AND I THINK THIS DEMONSTRATES KND OF A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING WITH OUR MODEL WE ARE AT THE KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN THE KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITAL. AND THE PERMANENTE MEDICAL GROUPS TOGETHER IN ONE SYSTEM THERE'S AN EXCLUSIVE CONTRACTING RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT IN THAT SYSTEM AND THOSE ENTITIES WORK SEAMLESSLY TO PROVIDE CARE FOR IT FOUR NINE MILLION MEMBERS. OUR MODEL IS INTEGRATED IN EVERY WAY NOT JUST CLINICALLY BUT FINANCIALLY ELECTRONICALLY ADMINISTRATIVELY GOVERNANCE AT CETERA. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE KAISER PERMANENTE A PERIOD. JUST BECAUSE KAISER FILE SOME INFORMATION DIFFERENTLY WITH OUR REGULATORS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT INFORMATION IS INCOMPLETE OR INFERIOR IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE ARE DIFFERENT. AND I DO HAVE TO QUARREL WITH THE THE CHARACTERIZATION I WAS ACTUALLY AROUND WHEN -- SB ELEVEN SIXTY THREE WAS MOVING THROUGH AND WE DID NEGOTIATE THAT LANGUAGE -- AND IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT THAT WAS AN ACCOMMODATION FOR US ON THE HEALTH PLAN REPORTING SIDE TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY IN AN ACCURATE WAY WITH REPORTING ARE COST TREND. BECAUSE WE ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF OUR INTEGRATED MODEL WHEN IT COMES TO CALCULATING TREND WE JUST DO IT DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER PLANS AND WE WHEN WE BUY CARE WE BY KAREN YOU IN NOT IN UNITS AND SEGMENTS WE ACTUALLY BY CARE -- ON A POPULATION BASIS A TOTAL COST OF CARE BASIS OF GLOBAL BUDGET BASIS -- OUR COST STRUCTURE IS DIFFERENT AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO SLICE AND DICE INTO THOSE SEGMENTS -- BACK. THE LENO BILL CALLED FOR IN SO WE SIMPLY ASK. FOR A VERY SMALL PROVISION THAT IS A AN ACCOMMODATION FOR US SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FILE IN A WAY THAT IS AN HONEST AND ACCURATE REFLECTION. OF OUR MODEL SO IT'S IT'S IT'S COMPLETELY INACCURATE TO SAY THAT WE PLAY BY DIFFERENT RULES WHEN IT COMES TO THE RATE REVIEW WE GO THROUGH THE SAME. VERY RIGOROUS RATE REVIEW PROCESS -- THAT EVERY OTHER HEALTH PLAN DOES AND I WILL ALSO CORAL THAT THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION THEN LET US GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING SO I THINK THAT IS AN UNFORTUNATE MIS CHARACTERIZATION OF OF THE THE PRIOR IN ACTUALLY CURRENT LEADERSHIP OF THAT DEPARTMENT -- WE GO THROUGH A VERY RIGOROUS PROCESS OVER THERE AND AND WE'RE NOT EXEMPT -- WE JUST SIMPLY SHOW ONE PART OF OUR RATE SUBMISSION A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY -- THAN OTHER PLANS BUT WE ARE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH THAT -- I WANT TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME ON THE HOSPITAL PART OF THE BILL THAT THE SUPPORTERS DIDN'T REALLY FOCUS ON THAT AND THAT'S FRANKLY THE MORE PROBLEMATIC. PORTION OF THE BILL -- AGAIN THEY THE LANGUAGE IT'S IN THAT STATUTE WHEN IT COMES TO REPORTING TOSH POT IS NOT AN EXEMPTION WE FILE ALL OF THE SAME ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY QUARTERLY REPORTS AS OUR HOSPITAL COLLEAGUES. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE AND THAT'S BECAUSE KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITALS ARE ORGANIZED DIFFERENTLY THAN ANY OTHER HOSPITAL AND THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE STARTED IN CALIFORNIA DECADES AGO THAT'S HOW WE GREW UP. WE HAVE THIRTY SIX HOSPITALS INCALIFORNIA. AND THEY ARE OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE REGIONAL K. FH ORGANIZATION THEY ARE NOT INDIVIDUAL STANDALONE FINANCIAL ENTITIES AND SO SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY REQUIRE. REQUIRE US TO SUBMIT SPECIFICALLY THAT THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION -- THE BALLOT SHEET THE INCOME STATEMENT THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOW THAT DOESN'T EXIST AT THE FACILITY LEVEL IT JUST DOESN'T OUR INDIVIDUAL HOSPITALS ARE ASSETS OF THE REGIONAL ORGANIZATION. SO WE ACTUALLY DO FILE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN THE OCCUPIED REPORTING AT THE FACILITY BASIS AND WE'RE TRYING TO BE ABLE TO DO. TO DO MORE AND TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT IN THAT SPACE BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND IT'S IMPORTANT BUT WITH RESPECT TO THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE INFORMATION. LITERALLY DOESN'T EXIST AND SO WE FILE -- THE CONSOLIDATED REPORT -- AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL SO. I I THINK AT THE MEMBERS IN BOTH OF THESE THESE LAWS AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT WE SEND IS THE TRUTH. IT IS AN HONEST AT AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF OF OUR OUR OPERATING MODEL IN AND HOW WE DO BUSINESS IRONICALLY. THIS BILL WILL ACTUALLY IS ACTUALLY ASKING US TO BE LESS TRANSPARENT TO ACTUALLY OBSCURE THE TRUTH AND CANGE THE STORY THAT IS THE STORY AND AND SPEND A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY DOING IT. UP FOR FOR WHAT PURPOSE WERE WERE NOT CLEAR WE WOULD ACTUALLY PREFER TO SPEND MONEY ON ON HEALTH CARE -- INSTEAD OF ON ADMINISTRATION. MY FINAL THOUGHT -- MEMBERS BUT BESIDES SORT OF THE THE NUTS AND BOLTS CONCERN OF THE BILL I THINK WHAT WHAT FRUSTRATES US ABOUT THE BILL IS. THAT IT REALLY IS TAKING THE LAW BACKWARDS AND AND HEALTH CARE EXPERTS HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS AND SENATOR PANDAS HAVE A HEARING ON THIS WE NEED TO ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE AND TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM INTO. A VALUE BASED SYSTEM AND NOT A VOLUME BASED SYSTEM -- WE WANT TO SEE WE WANT TO MAYBE THINK A LITTLE BIT BIGGER EXPAND OUR THINKING A LITTLE BIT AND SO HOW DO WE USE THE STATUTE INSTEAD OF GOING BACKWARDS AND TINKERING WITH. A TEN YEAR OLD LAW HOW DO WE ACTUALLY BE A LITTLE BIT MORE ASPIRATIONAL HOW DO WE LOOK AT THE STATUTE AND SEE HOW WE CAN. REUSE POLICY TO LEVERAGE THE KIND OF CHANGE WE WANT TO SEE IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO REALLY REWARD AND INCENTIVIZE THE KIND OF OF A FINANCIAL ALIGNMENT THAT WE WANT TO SEE TO CREATE THAT. THAT VALUE BASED CARE AND REALLY BEGIN TO BEND THE COST CURVE. YES SO I I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S FRUSTRATING US IS IT ACTUALLY TAKES US BACKWARDS WE ACTUALLY THINK THERE'S MORE WE CAN DO TO ACTUALLY -- ENCOURAGING INCENTIVIZE THESE KIND OF PAYMENT MODELS SO HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO TO TALK TO SENATOR PAN BUT WE'D LIKE TO BE HAVING A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THAT IS -- OPPOSED TO PLEASE COME FORWARD LAST CALL. SENATORS YES SUCCESS THANK YOU -- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF I MAY. WELL FIRST OF ALL I KNOW THAT JUST I JUST HEARD KAISER HOME STATE THEY HAVE A UNIQUE INTEGRATIVE MODEL ARE THERE ANY OTHER HOSPITALS THAT HAVE THE SAME MODEL. FOR SIMILAR MODEL OR ARE THEY MOVING TOWARDS THAT MODEL. SO WITH THAT SAID IT THIS WAY -- THE TERMS OF YOUR HOUSE KAISER UNIQUE AND AS IS POINTED OUT -- BY A THE REPRESENTATIVE -- WHAT THEY DO HAVE THIS IS THEY HAVE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A HOSPITAL RIGHT FOUNDATION ALSO THAT HEALTH PLAN THEY HAVE A MEDICAL GROUP BRIGHTEN THEIR ALL TIGHTLY INTEGRATED SO THEY ALL DIRECTLY CONTRACTING CONTRACTING WELL SO? SO THAT IS SOMEWHAT UNIQUE IN THAT SENSE BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT -- THERE RE OTHER INTEGRATED SYSTEMS THEY MAY NOT BE AS TIGHT WITH THEIR HEALTH PLAN THAT AT THE ME HAVE YOUR HEALTH PLAN A CONTRACT WITH A NOTE SO FOR EXAMPLE -- UC DAVIS YOU KNOW THEY HAVE CAPITATED RACE AGO CROSS HOSPITALS. IT IS IT IS SO BUT AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH THIS BILL IS SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT TAKE THAT A PART IN ANY WAY -- BUT THAT YOU CANNOT YOU YOU DO YOU CAN AND YOU ACTUALLY. DO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THE INDIVIDUAL PIECES RIGHT. AS ALWAYS YOU CAN'T EVEN RUN YOUR SYSTEM IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON YOUR HOSPITAL. HOW MUCH YOU'RE SPENDING ON RADIOLOGY VERSUS WHAT YOU'RE SPENDING ON -- THE OTHER COMPONENTS THEN HOW DO YOU EVEN. RUN YOUR SYSTEM AND HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT PREMIUM YOU'RE CHARGING WHEN YOU'RE NEGOTIATING WITH -- WITH WHATEVER GROUP IN FACT ACTUALLY WHAT WE DO HERE AND I APPRECIATE THE ALL KINDS THAT'S WELL KNOWN WE NEGOTIATE WITH SOMEBODY WE CAN ACTUALLY HEAR THEM LOT MORE DETAILED INFORMATION. AND AND THEY DO AND AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- BUT WHAT WE DON'T GET AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT FOR EXAMPLE I SAID MORE GRANULARITY AND I APPRECIATE NO MORE WORK WITH KAISER ABOUT THIS. BUT FOR EXAMPLE THE HOSPITALS AND I I UNDERSTAND YOU GOT YOU KNOW WHAT AND TAX ID NUMBER SOMETHING FOR THE WHOLE THING BUT IT'S ALL OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NOW TELL YOU KAISER'S BIG IN SACRAMENTO IT'S BIG IN THE BAY AREA. THEY'RE ENTIRELY EVERY THEIR CLOTHES BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT HEALTHCARE MARKETS AFFECT EVEN COVERED CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THINGS CARVE TELL DIFFERENTLY RIGHT. SO THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS IS WE DON'T HAVE ALL WE HAVE IS ALL OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON BUT LIKE IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT THE PEOPLE SHOULD RUNNING THE SYSTEM. GO OH YEAH WELL WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IS GOING ON THE SACRAMENTO SIDE OF THINGS VERSUS THE BAY AREA SIDE OF THINGS VERSUS THE YOU KNOW WHATEVER OTHER. AREAS THEY HAVE IN THAT AND AND THAT THAT THAT PUZZLES ME A BIT. THERE TOO SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A LOT MORE GRANULARITY SO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON FOR THE REGULATORS RIGHT OF IT ALL IN ON CALIFORNIA'S THE SAME. I THINK THAT'S A BIT. DIFFICULT YEAH THAT THAT THAT. DOESN'T SOUND CREDIBLE SO -- SO I THINK WE WILL WE WE NEED TO WE WE NEED TO HAVE MORE TRANSPARENCY -- WE ARE REGULATORS THE YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON I THINK OUR PURCHASERS NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON FRANKLY HAVE A KAISER HAD AND I AGREE KAISER HAS A GREAT YOU KNOW WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE BASS PURCHASING WE HAVE AN INTEGRATED MODEL -- BUT THERE'S ALSO OTHER INTEGRATED MODELS AS WELL AND WE EXPECT THEM TO REPORT AND ART EXACTLY SEEMS KAISER NO. BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF THINGS ARE ASKING THE REPORT -- I'D ANYTHING KAISER CAN DO A LOT MORE THAN THEY'RE DOING NOW AND BECAUSE IF NOTHING ELSE I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO RUN THEIR SYSTEM. THANK YOU -- AND THE REASON I WAS ASKING OUT IS THAT -- YOU KNOW BECAUSE I HEAR THAT THEY HAVE A CARVE OUT. FOR THEM. AND I'M HEARING FROM YOU THAT THERE'S OTHERS MOM THE OTHER -- HOSPITALS THAT HAVE INTEGRATED MODELS MAYBE NOT IN THE SAME WAY BUT I THINK IT BOILS DOWN -- TO TRANSPARENCY ISSUE AND AND HAVING EQUITY -- AND IN THE MARKET AND SELL I JUST WANT TO JUST HEAR FROM -- FROM KAISER. THEN I UNDERSTAND AND I HEARD YOU SAY THIS IS A TEN YEAR MODEL I'M SORRY LAW THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON I JUST WANT TO HEAR. IF -- IT MAY BE COMPLICATED IS IT TIME THAT YOU NEED TO TRY AND COMPLY WITH THIS. CAN YOU ANSWER THAT THANK YOU CENTER WE'VE WE'VE BEEN COMPLYING WITH THE LAW TO BE CLEAR -- BOTH FLAWS TO MEAN THAT THE OCCUPIED THE WHOLE FOR THE HOSPITAL REPORTING HAS BEEN IN THE LAW FOR DECADES. AND OUTPUT HAS NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES WITH OUR REPORTS THE RATE REVIEW -- PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN IN THE LAW FOR FOR TEN YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN FULLY COMPLIANT SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT IT A LACK OF COMPLIANCE IT IS AGAIN. YEAH THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OF BLANK BOXES ON A FORM BUT I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THAT'S A FLAW IN THE FORM AND NOT WITH OUR REPORT SO. SO AND I THINK JUST IT TO TO KIND OF GRAB ONTO YOUR ACTUALLY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. IS THERE MORE THAT WE CAN DO IN EITHER OF THESE PROBABLY -- WE'VE DONE A LOT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'RE REALLY -- MAKING GREAT STRIDES WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPARENCY IT HAS NOT BEEN OUR STRONG SUIT IT HASN'T BEEN AND PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF OUR MODEL WE ARE SO TIGHTLY INTEGRATED. AND BECAUSE WE DO LOOK AT THE TOTAL COST O CARE OUR COST STRUCTURE IS DIFFERENT OUR BUDGETING IS DIFFERENT WHICH IS DIFFERENT. BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE MARKET AND ARE PURCHASERS -- OUR LARGE GROUP PURCHASERS ARE ARE LARGE YOU KNOW CALPERS AND COVER COME HAVE BEEN PUSHING US THEY WANT TO UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD WHAT'S DRIVING MY RATES WHAT IS YOU KNOW HELP US UNDERSTAND AND SO WE UNDERSTAND THE MARKET IS IS IS PUSHING US ON THAT -- WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S VALUE IN THESE REPORTS TO RUN REGULATORS SO. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE -- THERE'S THERE'S SOME INFORMATION IN HERE AS I MENTIONED WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT WE CAN'T DO BECAUSE OF THAT THE STRUCTURE OF OUR OSPITAL SYSTEM. SO. THERE MAY BE THINGS WE CAN DO TO IT. TO YOU KNOW BUT AGAIN. AS WE START SLICING AND DICING I WANTED HER TO GET BACK TO IS THAT REALLY WHERE WE WANT TO GO WITH WITH POLICY. DON'T WE WANT TO REALLY LOOK AT THAT GLOBAL BUDGET BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOSPITALS AND I THINK DOCTOR PAN WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SORT OF IS THE OLD WAY OF THINKING ABOUT HOSPITALS MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON ON ON FINANCES AND MONEY AND VOLUME AND HEADS IN BEDS AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO GET AWAY FROM. OUR HOSPITALS THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT VOLUME THERE ONLY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING GOOD CARE AND IT'S ACTUALLY IN PART. TO THE FOLKS THAT THE SPONSOR REPRESENTS WE HAVE GREAT HEALTH CARE TEAMS THAT ARE BETTER. KNOCKING THOSE QUALITY SCORES -- OFF THE CHART BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FOCUSED ON WHETHER THEY'RE GONNA MAKE BUDGET THIS YEAR THOUGH I I WOULD ASSERT THAT THAT'S THE DIRECTION WE WANT TO TAKE HEALTHCARE AND GO. TO LOOKING FOR OUTCOMES AND VALUE AND QUALITY -- INSTEAD OF WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SAY TODAY. WELL. CAN I JUST SAY ONE BECAUSE OF AN EVER SAID THAT KAISER WAS VIOLATING THE LAW THE REASON WE'RE HERE AND DOING A BILL IS BECAUSE OF LAW AS IT CURRENTLY IS IS NOT. ACHIEVING THE RESULTS THAT WE DESIRE TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY. I WAS GONNA ADD TO THAT -- BECAUSE I THINK YOU MISUNDERSTOOD MY QUESTION I WASN'T IMPLYING BY ANY MEANS THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLAINING THE LAST TEN YEARS I DO. THAT. CLEARLY YOU USED TO REPORTING IN A CERTAIN WAY WHICH IS THE LONG. AND THE NOW WITH THE CHANGES THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT HERE IN THIS SITE LEGISLATION I WAS TRYING TO SEE WE CAN. BRIDGE THE GAP TO ALLOW YOU AT LEAST TIME IF THAT'S WHAT YOU NEEDED. TO DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO -- BUT I DID HEAR YOU JUST SAY RIGHT NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT CONCERNED WITH THE BOTTOM LINE HOWEVER I HEARD YOU JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO THAT. THAT YOU CAN DO IT BUT IT WAS GOING TO COST A LOT OF MONEY AND YOU WHAT RATHER USE THAT MONEY TOWARDS HEALTH CARE SO THERE IS SOME CONCERN WITH THE BOTTOM LINE -- BUT AGAIN I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRIDGE THAT GAP SO THAT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS LEGISLATION YOU WOULD HAVE THAT TIME OR TRY TO WORK WITH YOU TO TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY'RE SUFFICIENT TIME BUT I NOT SURE THAT TIME IS WHAT YOU NEED -- BUT THANK YOU THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION THANK YOU DOCTOR SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU -- THIS IS COMPLEX. AND I THINK KAISER IS A UNIQUE ANIMAL. AND I THINK -- YOU KNOW THE OLDER SAY TO MOLD THE CREATIVE THE WHOLE HMO MODEL WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF MOTIVATION YOUR BUSINESS. IT'S BEEN A WE GET THAT BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENT. KIND OF MOTIVATION IN TERMS OF PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES AND THAT OTHER HOSPITALS DON'T NECESSARILY HALF AND SO I GET THAT AND SO WHEN I STRUGGLE WITH THIS EXPECTATION PERHAPS ON OUR IN. THAT THERE WOULD BE THAT THERE EVEN CAN BE AN APPLE TO APPLE COMPARISON FOR REGULATORS I WONDER HOW REALISTIC THAT THAT IS. AND AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO DRIVE TO AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON. TO GET TO THE ROOT ISSUE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING. TO TO TO FIX OR IDENTIFY -- THE KAISER WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOUR REGIONAL YOU KNOW HOW MANY HOSPITALS ARE PER REGION IS IT LIKE. DOCTOR PAN SAID THAT THAT THAT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CHI CHI'S IN NORTH IS EVERY HOSPITAL IN KAISER NORTH YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU DEFINE YOUR REGION'S BECAUSE OF THE REGIONS ARE. SMALL ENOUGH THERE ARE FEWER ENOUGH HOSPITALS IN IT. WHILE IT WON'T BE AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON IT MAY BE EASIER TO EXTRAPOLATE THE KIND OF DATA. THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SO HOW MANY HOSPITALS PER REGION YEAH IT SO THERE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION IN SOUTHERN CAL IS ALL ONE WRONG SO BUT AGAIN BUT THAT'S THE LEGAL STRUCTURE. K. FH NOR RIGHT OWNS THE HOSPITALS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RIGHT THEY ARE ONE THEY ARE THAT THEY ARE THE ASSETS OF KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITAL THEY'RE NOT STANDALONE FINANCIAL AND I GET YOUR THE I GET IS RIGHT. SO I THINK IN INTO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON I THINK YOU REALLY HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD BECAUSE I THINK IT IS MISLEADING. TO SAY THAT THERE CAN BE AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON HERE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT AN APPLE I GET IT WE'RE ACTUALLY MORE LIKE AN APPLE PIE ACTUALLY HIT -- BUT SERIOUSLY BECAUSE YEAH GIVE THOUGH THE GOAL. WHAT TO DROUGHT WITH THAT GIVEN THE UNDERLYING MOTIVATING FACTOR WHICH IS TO GET HAVE A SENSE OF HOW WE MEASURE [inaudible] COST. IT MAY NOT BE AN APPLES TO APPLES BUT BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO KIND OF PLAY IN THE SANDBOX IN TERMS OF SHEDDING SOME LIGHT. TO THE REGULATORS ABOUT WHAT INFORMS YOUR DECISION MAKING AROUND HOW YOUR COSTS ARE. DECLARED AND SO IF NOT THIS WAY THEN WHAT YEAH NO I THINK ON THE ON THE COST CHARGE REVENUE SIDE YEAH I THINK THERE'S THERE'S ROOM THERE FOR US TO TALK MORE ABOUT HOW WE CAN REPORT THAT IN A MORE GRANULAR BASIS. THAT IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO AGAIN AND THAT WAS MY POINT ABOUT WE WOULD NEED TO INVEST ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND AND HIRE. ACCOUNTANTS AND ACTUARIES IN ORDER TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT REALLY IS REVAMPING ITS REVAMPING OUR ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS BUT IT'S IT'S DOABLE. ON THAT I I THINK I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT. AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE OWNERSHIP OF THE HOSPITALS THAT INFORMATION JUST. DOESN'T EXIST AND WE DON'T WANNA MAKE IT UP SO I THINK THERE IS ROOM TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT AND OPEN. ABOUT THE THE REVENUE AND AND CHARGE ASPECT OF IT WHEN WE CAN HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND THE LET'S GET CLEAR ABOUT WHY THAT'S APPROPRIATE BECAUSE A HOW. MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES ARE KAISER PATIENTS I MEAN I THINK THE THE THE ROLE WE PLAY IN IT IS GIVEN THE SHEER VOLUME OF STATE DOLLARS. THAT ARE FUNNELED THROUGH. NORTH OR SOUTH OF ME SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN THE CONVERSATION GENERALLY. AND I AND I WOULD ASSUME IN ALL FAIRNESS THE OTHER HOSPITALS EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR SYSTEM ALSO HAVE TO HAVE PERSONNEL IN PLACE. TO ADHERE TO ALL OF THE REGULATORS IN ALL THE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT ALL OF OUR ASK -- FOR SO IN FAIRNESS SHINGLES ACOSTA BORN ALL BE THEY DIFFERENT -- IN IN THE OTHER HOSPITAL SYSTEMS -- TO AND I WOULD VENTURE TO ASSUME THAT WITHOUT A VEHICLE GOING THROUGH. THE THE CONVERSATION -- WOULDN'T -- HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF MOTIVATION. AS IF THERE WERE NOT INTERFERE TODAY YEAH IN TERMS OF THESE REPORTS PROBABLY BUT AGAIN AS AS I STATED YOU KNOW TRANSPARENCY IN WANTING TO UNDERSTAND MORE WHAT WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD IS IS A IS. A CONVERSATION ARE PURCHASERS ARE WANTING OF US APPROPRIATELY -- AND WE'VE WE'VE MADE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO MORE ABOUT THAT SO I THINK THAT IS CHANGING US INTERNALLY A LITTLE BIT WE WANT TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THAT BUT YEAH THIS THIS BILL IS IS. ADDITIONALLY CHALLENGING RIGHT SO LET ME SAY DOCTOR PAN THAT I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY YOU KNOW HOW WE LIKE TO DO THESE CABBIE OUT MOST SUPPORTED TODAY. BUT I DO THINK IT IS FAIR TO WITH KNOWLEDGE THE KAISER HE IS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL AND THAT ISN'T TO SUGGEST THAT IT'S BAD. THEY WERE THE FIRST THEY CREATED A CERTAIN MODEL BUT MANY HAVE FOLLOWED -- AND SO I THINK WE DO HAVE TO WORK TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET TO THE REAL CRUX OF THE QUESTION. IN ALL AND AN APPLES TO APPLES. I DON'T THINK IT'S A FAIR EXPECTATION OF IT IF THERE IS A WAY TO GET THERE -- AND I BELIEVE THE VEHICLES PROBABLY NECESSARY TO MOVE THE CONVERSATION ALONG WHICH IS WHY I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT -- BUT BUT I THINK THAT THAT WE NEED TO ALSO BE FAIR IN TERMS OF IT MAY NOT LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER HOSPITAL APPLES -- BUT HOW DO WE GET TO THE CRUX THE CORE ISSUES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE AND PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN DO THAT. IN THE MAY I JUST SAY ACTUALLY I AM FULL AGREEMENT WITH YOU CENTER I TO CHILL AND WHILE THE BILL IS IN ITS CURRENT FORM WE'RE STILL WAITING TO HAVE. THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN APPLE THE APPLE BUT IT'S GOT TO BE. BASICALLY WE HAVE TO GET THE KIND OF DATA WE NEED TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS SO I UNDERSTAND MAY BE SIMILAR NOT IDENTICAL GIVEN THE STRUCTURE. BUT WE BUT THAT IDEA THAT WELL SORRY YOU KNOW WE HAVE A REPORT THAT SAYS IT BLANK BLANK BLANK BLANK AND IT'S ALL ROLLED UP INTO ONE NUMBER. ISN'T ENOUGH PLANET GRANULARITY YEAH I GET IT MAYBE AND MAYBE IT'S A CUT MAYBE IT'S AN ISSUE OF AT LEAST INITIALLY LE CONVERSATIONS WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. IF THERE CAN BE SOME KIND OF AGREEMENT ON WHAT -- THE SHARED GOAL IS [inaudible] THANK YOU. CENTER LEYVA AND CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU SENATOR STONE. SO MY FIRST START OFF BY SAYING LOVE KAISER I DON'T PERSONALLY HAVE THEM BUT WHEN I WAS WITH YOU OF CW X.. ONE WHEN I WAS AT THE U. OF C. W. -- WE NEGOTIATED CARE FOR OUR MEMBERS WHO LOVE THEM -- AND I HAVE TO SAY AS I SHARED WITH YOU ALREADY THERESA IT WAS A BIG POINT OF FRUSTRATION FOR US AT THE BARGAINING TABLE. BECAUSE WE COULD NEVER GET TO THE ROOT OF HEALTH ACTUALLY CALCULATE THE RATES -- WE WERE ALWAYS TOLD THAT WAS IN THE BLACK BOX AND WE TO SAY PLEASE OPEN THE BLACK BOX WE'D LIKE TO GET INSIDE AND SEE. AND IT MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR US AS NEGOTIATORS WHEN WE'RE NEGOTIATING -- PLANS WITH KAISER WITH BLUE CROSS PPO WITH WHOEVER WE'RE NEGOTIATING WITH WE COULD SEE A BREAK DOWN WE UNDERSTOOD OUR EXPERIENCE RATE WE KNEW WHERE THE COST INCREASES ARE COMING FROM. BUT WE NEVER KNEW WITH KAISER SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- ONE I WOULD THINK THAT YOU HAVE A TEAM THAT PROCESSES CLAIMS. AND THEY WOULD ENCOUNTER DATA. COULD THEY NOT USE THAT DATA OR USE THOSE CLAIMS TO EXTRAPOLATE OUT HOW MUCH IT COSTS FOR CERTAIN. VISITS AND CERTAIN THINGS THAT HAPPEN [inaudible] SO ACTUALLY. THAT'S NOT TRUE WE BEGIN DON'T HAVE A CLAIMS DEPARTMENT PAID WHAT WE DO NOW BECAUSE SOME OF OUR OUTSIDE SERVICES ARE CLAIMS BASED RIGHT BUT OUR MODEL. THE THE CORE STRUCTURE OF HOW WE FUNCTION IS IS A PREPAID RISK BASED SYSTEM RIGHT SO THAT SO IT'S A PM PM. THERE ARE NO CLAIMS ARE OUR PHYSICIANS DON'T BILL THE HEALTH PLAN THE HOSPITALS DON'T BILL THE HEALTH PLAN IT IT'S IT'S IT'S THAT SORT OF TOTAL TOTAL% COST O CARE BUDGET RIGHT. BUT HAVING SAID THAT AGAIN THE CLAIMS DATA IS WHERE THE TRANSPARENCY COMES FROM AND WHAT OUR PURCHASERS WANT TO SEE AND SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY AGAIN SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN WORK OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS -- TO TO CREATE THAT CLAIMS DATA WERE ACTUALLY. MANUFACTURING THE CLAIMS DATA WHICH IS WHICH IS THE THE ENCOUNTER DATA TIMES PRICE RIGHT WHICH IS REALLY WHAT IT IS SO WE'VE ACTUALLY WORKED SO HARD TO SAY THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT HOW WE DO IT. WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING THAT THAT THAT. TOTAL COST OF CARE APPROACH BUT BECAUSE IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO CALPERS AND OUR LABOR TRUSTS AND OUR OUR PUBLIC SECTOR PURCHASERS WE ARE CREATING THAT DATA FOR THEM SO THEY CAN SEE THAT -- IMPORTANTLY PROTECTING MEMBERS PRIVACY -- WHILE WE'RE DOING THAT BUT WE CAN ACTUALLY SHOW THE UTILIZATION AND AND THE ENCOUNTER INFORMATION NOW AND SO THAT'S A BIG IMPROVEMENT WE WE WELCOME YOU TO COME BACK IN AND CHECK IT OUT WHEN I DON'T KNOW. THOSE. DAYS ARE OVER THANK YOU. OKAY SO I WANT TO UNDERSTAND I HAVE A PPO SO I GO TO MY DOCTOR AND I HAVE A CHECK UP AND HE SAYS -- CONNIE WE WANT TO CHECK YOUR LIVER FUNCTION WALKED DOWN THE HALL AND LET'S DO A SONOGRAM GREAT WE DO THAT THEN HE SAYS -- WALK ACROSS THE HALL AND WE'RE DRAW SOME BLOOD WORK OKAY GREAT SO WE DO THAT WHEN I GET MY STATEMENT. IT SHOWS ME ITEMIZED WHAT I HAD DONE WHAT THE COST WAS NOW MY MOTHER IN LAW JOSEPHINE WHO HAS KAISER AND MY HUSBAND I SOMETIMES TAKE HER TO THE DOCTOR. THE SAME THING HAPPENS TO HER AND SHE GOES IN AND HE HAS HER PHYSICAL AND THEN HE SAYS ALL YOU KNOW WHAT JOSEPHINE WE WANT TO CHECK -- Là -- FUNCTION GO DOWN THE HALL WE WANT TO CHECK YOU TAKE SOME BLOOD GO ACROSS THE HALL. WHEN SHE GETS A BILL IT'S NOT ITEMIZED BUT I I THINK I'M JUST HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING WHAT DOESN'T KAISER HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THAT SONOGRAM COST? ANY IDEA WHAT THAT BLOOD WORK COST BECAUSE I'M THINKING THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO HIRE PEOPLE TO DO THE JOB SO AT THE VERY LEAST YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT THEIR SALARY WAS. I JUST THINK YOUR SALARIES OKAY BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF ACOSTA SIS SO TO MY MOTHER IN LAW GOES AND HAS THOSE PROCEDURES TO AND THAT WOULD COST KAISER X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS BECAUSE SHE HAD THREE TWO THAT'S REALLY THEM. THAT'S THE RISK BEARING SO SO THAT THE MEDICAL GROUP FOR EXAMPLE. MERRILY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THAT CARE EVEN IN OUR HOSPITALS RIGHT SO OUR PHYSICIANS PRACTICE IN OUR HOSPITALS -- AND AND THAT ACTUALLY CREATES EVEN AT A TIGHTER AND TIGHTER INTEGRATION BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE PERMANENTE MEDICAL GROUPS AND THE HEALTH PLAN. SUPER SECRET DOCUMENT BUT ALL OF THAT IS IS IS IN THAT DOCUMENT IT'S IT'S THE CONTRACT IT'S THE MEDICAL GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THESE THINGS. YOU'RE GONNA GET THIS AMOUNT PER MONTH FOR ALL OF THESE MEMBERS YOU'RE GONNA TAKE AS GOOD CARE OF THEM AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN IF THEY'RE HEALTHY GOOD FOR YOU THAT'S UPSIDE RISK IF THEY GET SICK. BAD FOR YOU THAT'S DOWNSIDE RISK AND THAT'S KINDA HOW IT HOW IT WORKS FOR US AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY REALLY HARNESS THAT MODELS IT TO EVEN MAKE IT DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT STRONGER SO. THERE AREN'T THERE AREN'T BILLS -- THEY GO OUT -- FOR THE MOST PART IT IT IS IT IS IT IS ALL PREPAID AND IT'S A RISK BASED AND REALLY THAT THE PATIENT IS NOT INVOLVED IN THAT AND I I'VE BEEN A BECAUSE REMEMBER. FOR FORTY YEARS I'VE NEVER HAD A BILL AND AND THAT'S BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S IT'S THE FOCUS ON ON THE THE OVERALL PERSON -- IN DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES TO KEEP THAT PERSON HEALTHY WHICH IS THAT VALUE BASED OUTCOMES BASED STRUCTURE THAT WE REALLY THINK WE NEED TO BE MOVING TO OKAY SO YOU HAVE A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS RIGHT. OKAY SO HOW DO YOU DETERMINE IF YOU HAVE A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLAN YOU'VE GOT A YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHAT THE THAT'S WHY WE'RE GETTING NOW IS WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS HAD HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS THAT'S A RELATIVELY NEW ADDITION TO OR BENEFIT PACKAGE. BUT AGAIN BECAUSE THE MARKET WAS ASKING FOR THAT RIGHT SO FOR THAT REASON WE DO TRACK VERY CAREFULLY THE SERVICES SO THAT WE CAN SET SO THAT WE CAN TRACK -- THAT THE COST SHARING AND THE DEDUCTIBLE AND AND ALL OF THAT SO THERE IS THAT THAT TRACKING GOING ON AT THE AT THE PEOPLE YOU GET IN THERE. YEAH GET ME OUT ALL RIGHT WHICH WILL GET YOU A LITTLE FARTHER ALONG INTERSTATE. BECAUSE I JUST I CAN'T EXPRESS YOUR MEAN I'VE BEEN GONE FOR FOUR YEARS NOW -- I DON'T NEGOTIATE THOSE CONTRACTS ANYMORE BUT I CAN'T SHARE WITH THAT I CAN'T EXPRESS ENOUGH HOW FRUSTRATING IT WAS. AND HOW HARD IT WAS FOR US TO NEGOTIATE BENEFITS FOR OUR MEMBERS WITH EMPLOYERS WHO DIDN'T WANT TO PAY A DIME TOWARDS THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE WHEN WE CAN'T WE DON'T HAVE GOOD HONEST DATA AND INFORMATION. SO THAT WE CAN SAY LOOK KAISER'S ACTUALLY BETTER DEAL WHY DON'T WE GO TO KAISER -- LOOK BLUE CROSS PPO IS ACTUALLY BETTER DEAL MAYBE WE SHOULD GO WITH THEM. IT JUST MAKES IT HARD TO DO OTHER IT MAKES IT HARD FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO DO THEIR JOBS. WHEN YOU CAN'T BREAK DOWN THAT DATA I KNOW THAT YOU'RE DIFFERENT MODEL BUT I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS FOR A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE AND MAYBE WE CAN START FIGURING OUT A WAY TO FIND THOSE NUMBERS? THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IN A RUNNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WON'T BELABOR THIS I ONLINE MONEY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES -- I DO APPLAUD THE WORK KAISER DOES IN TRYING. TO I THINK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT DIVISION OF PROMOTING HEALTH IN NOT JUST TREATMENT OF DISEASE AND ILLNESS -- WE NEED TO DO THAT SYSTEM WIDE IN ALL SYSTEMS. AND FORTUNE WE HAVE A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM TREATMENT OF ILLNESS AND DISEASE THE PROFIT OFTEN -- IN NOT IN THE PREVENTION. THAT SAID IN WITH RESPECT TO THE INTEGRATED SYSTEM THAT IS KAISER -- HAVE THREE GRANDCHILDREN ALL BORN AT KAISER ONE WHO HAD AN EMERGENCY APPENDECTOMY AND CAME OUT JUST FINE SO. WE'RE BIG FANS OF THE SERVICES. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORKERS WHO ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE I THINK. COM IN THAT INTEGRATED SYSTEM THERE'S PHYSICIANS BEING PAID AT ONE LEVEL NURSES THAT ANOTHER CUSTODIAN SAID ANOTHER -- I'M SURE SOME SERVICES ARE CONTRACTED OUT THERE'S FACILITIES. BUT SOMEWHERE SOMEBODY'S KEEPING TRACK OF THE MONEY COME IN IN IN THE MONEY GOING OUT. AND EVEN IF IT'S A DIFFERENT SYSTEM THAN A STANDALONE HOSPITAL. I WOULD HOPE THAT IN IN IN YOU'VE BEEN CANDID AND FORTHRIGHT TODAY OF THE EFFORTS IN AREAS OF POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT. I WOULD HOPE THIS BILL THAT I WILL SUPPORT TODAY DOES LEAD TO SOME FURTHER CONVERSATIONS RESPECT BY THE AUTHOR OF SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES -- IN THAT IT LEADS TO THAT APPLE PIE THAT YOU REFERRED TO WHEN THIS BILL IS FULLY BAKED BUT I I JUST THINK. THE NUMBERS ARE OUT THERE. LET'S CATCH HIM FIGURE OUT HOW. TO ACHIEVE THAT LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY. FOR THE PATIENT COMMUNITY FOR THE HEALTH COMMUNITY FOR THE WORK FORCE -- I THINK WE CAN GET THERE SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND WILL SUPPORT THIS TODAY IN WATCHES. YOUR CONVERSATIONS MOVE FORWARD TOWARDS THE APPLE PIE THANK YOU. BIGGEST IN A MINING. YES BUT IF I MAY WRAP IT UP AND DOWN YOU KNOW AND I'VE HAD A DISCUSSION WITH HIM PRIOR TO COMING HERE BECAUSE IT WAS A CONCERN OF MINE THAT. YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH KAISER TWENTY SURE THAT -- YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE GET USED TO DOING SOMETHING IN A CERTAIN WAY IT TAKES LONGER TO GET THERE SO PLEASE CONTINUE THAT DISCUSSION THAT WE ALSO DISCUSSED THAT I WILL. RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE MY MIND LATER BUT I WANT WITH THAT I WANT TO MOVE THE THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I JUST HAVE A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS AND HOURS GETTING LATE SO -- FOR THE SEIU RAP -- DESI ARE YOU OPPOSE THE COMEDY LANGUAGE THAT KAISER REQUESTED IN THE ORIGINAL RATE REVIEW -- OR ASHKHABAD STATUTE. NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE -- WE DIDN'T OPPOSE THEM. AND THAT'S WHY HE DIDN'T OPPOSE IT AT THAT TIME AND WELL THE ASHRAM LANGUAGE I BELIEVE WAS PUT IN PLACE IN THE SEVENTIES OR EIGHTIES SO I'M. THAT IS WAY BEFORE MY TIME AND ALSO MY MY PREDECESSORS WIFE CONNECTED WITH SO I COULDN'T SPEAK TO THAT -- IN TERMS OF THE RATE REVIEW PROCESS LANGUAGE I THINK THERE WAS AN EXPECTATION THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT'S IN STATUTE NOW WOULD HAVE ALLOWED KAISER TO DO ITS BEST AND I THINK WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT'S BEEN FILED THE LAST THREE YEARS AND RATE REVIEW AND WE'RE SAYING. HEISER IS FALLEN FAR SHORT OF DOING ITS BEST IN TERMS OF WHAT'S IN EXISTING LAW THEY GOT A SPECIAL MENTION -- OVER THAT TIME THERE'S THEY'VE SUBMITTED ONE NUMBER FOR ALL THE SIX BENEFIT CATEGORIES THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO TRY TO DO THEIR BEST TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE SIX BENEFIT CATEGORIES TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY. WE DON'T THINK THAT ONE NUMBER FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GETS YOU THERE. AND THEY'VE -- INCREASED RATES EACH OF THOSE YEARS INCLUDING THE MOST RECENT FIVE POINT 1% RATE INCREASE AGAIN WITH NO JUSTIFICATION OTHER THAN THE PRICES ARE HIGHER THEY DON'T TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF UTILIZATION AT KAISER. AND SO WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS THE NEED -- FOR YOU KNOW. YES MEAN. TESTIFIED VERY WELL TOO YOU KNOW THERE. MAYBE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SOME LAPSES ON THE REGULATORY SIDE BUT THERE IS A NEED TO GET KAISER TO A PLACE OF EQUAL FOOTING WITH WHERE THE REST OF THE MARKET IS. AND IF THIS YEAR'S RATE INCREASE PUTS THE BLUE SHIELD ON AVERAGE PRODUCTS 12% TWELVE DOLLARS EXCUSE ME LOWER THAN THE KAISER PRODUCT ON AVERAGE YOU KNOW. IS THAT TWELVE DOLLARS A FACTOR OF ALL THOSE OTHER INSURANCE PLANS AND ALL THOSE OTHER HOSPITALS AND ALL THOSE OTHER DOCTORS HAVING TO COMPLY WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF REGULATION AND TRANSPARENCY IT'S IT'S SIMPLY NOT FAIR. TO SAY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRODUCE THE SAME LEVELS OF INFORMATION AND JUSTIFICATION AND THEN YOU CAN CHARGE SO SLIGHTLY LOWER RATES THAN SOMEBODY ELSE DOES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER AND AND DOCTOR PAN PRESUMING THE PRISM OF THE YOU BEEN IN CONTACT WITH OCCUPIED -- ABOUT THE BILL IN THEIR DATA COLLECTION IF ONLY FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT WITH THE KAISER COULD EVEN PROVIDE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT THIS BILL WOULD -- MANDATE. SO -- I I DON'T SPEAK DIRECTLY FOR US I SPIED -- BUT THANK THE THE ISSUES REALLY WHAT KAISER -- PROVIDES AND WHAT THEY FILE AND I'VE EXAMS ON THE FILINGS AND THERE'S A LOT OF WELL BLANKS BASICALLY SAYING REFER TO THIS ONE NUMBER. AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S PROBLEMATIC -- AND AND SO -- I I DON'T I SPORTS MAINLY. I START SELF IS MORE OF A DATA COLLECTOR THAN ANYTHING ELSE I MEAN I BUT I WOULD SAY IS THAT UNFORTUNATELY THE THE LEVEL OF GRANULARITY OF INFORMATION WE'RE GETTING IS -- IT IS NOT VERY HELPFUL OR USEFUL RIGHT WHEN YOU AG ALL OF THOSE IN CALIFORNIA WELL GEE I MEAN I'M IN IN SACRAMENTO MARKET I KNOW THIS WILL EVEN MULTIPLE HOSPITALS AND SECOND I CAN'T. PULL OUT WHAT'S GOING ON SACRAMENTO VERSES THE BAY AREA VERSES. AT PRESENT OUR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S IT THE AND YET YOU KNOW WHAT EVERY OTHER HOSPITAL AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THE THE APPLE IT IT'S NOT NOTHING ON THE APPLE EXACTLY APPLE APPLE BUT WE WE THERE'S A REASON WE ASK THOSE OTHER INSTITUTE. OTHER HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTH PLANS FOR INFORMATION AS WELL AND SO I THINK THERE IS ALSO AN ISSUE OF FAIRNESS THAT COMES OUT TO ABOUT WELL WHY DO THEY HAVE. TO TELL US STUFF AND KAISER DOESN'T AND WHAT'S GOING ON THERE BUT IT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S IT COMES DOWN -- TO DO ARE WE GETTING THE KIND OF INFORMATION TO REACH THE KIND OF GOAL TO WANNA CHIEF FOR OUR REGULATORS AND FOR OUR PURCHASERS AND FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SO THEY CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON OKAY. THANK YOU -- AND THEN TO RESA COUPLE THINGS A FIRST OF ALL I'M ALSO A FAN OF KAISER -- THE KAISER IN SAN DIEGO I HAVE TO SAY I'M VERY IMPRESSED SAY MY BROTHER LAWS LIFE WHO HAD TO HAVE A A BIRD SEE CROWDED BYPASS SURGERY AND CAME THROUGH WITH FLYING COLORS. I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR OR YOUR OPERATION -- SO WITH RESPECT TO THE HOSPITAL REPORTING OF THE BILL IF THIS WERE TO PASS IN ITS CURRENT FORM -- BASED ON WHAT YOU YOU SAID HOW WOULD YOU COMPLY YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT IF YOU HAD TO COMPLY THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE LESS TRANSPARENT THAN THE MECHANISM THAT YOUR YOUR YOU'RE DOING TODAY COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT YEAH I MEAN I THINK AS I AS WE SORT. OF CHATTED WITH WITH SENATOR MITCHELL ABOUT THAT. WITH RESPECT TO THE HOSPITAL REPORTING THERE THERE IS PROBABLY MORE WE CAN DO AT A MORE GRANULAR GRANULAR LEVEL WITH RESPECT TO THE THE CHARGE INFORMATION HOSPITAL CHARGES THE PATIENT REVENUE -- I FORGET IF THAT'S THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE OR THE QUARTERLY REPORT -- THAT IS NOT A CHEAP THING FOR US TO DO SO I THINK AGAIN YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WE'RE WE'RE WILLING TO DO THAT WORK IN AND REALLY. SORT OF FREAK REVAMP THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS TO TO ALLOCATE THAT AND FIGURE THAT OUT FOR THIRTY SIX HOSPITALS YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF TWO REPORTS THERE WOULD BE THIRTY SIX REPORTS THAT'S NOT. THIS IS ALL MANUAL ENTRY AND WE LOVE OUR SPOT BUT THEIR THEIR TECHNICAL PLATFORM IS NOT GREAT -- SO THAT SO THERE'S AN INVESTMENT THERE -- I WOULD SO WE CAN DO IT IT'S DOABLE IT WILL BE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY -- THAT IS IN IN CONTRAST TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- WHICH THAT THE BALANCE SHEET THE INCOME STATEMENT -- IS IF YOU REFER TO AS THE PANELS. THAT AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE LEGAL STRUCTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION THAT LITERALLY DOESN'T EXIST AT THE FACILITY LEVEL. SO. THE HOSPITALS ARE ASSETS OF KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITAL SO -- IF IF YOU OWN THREE TV'S IN YOUR HOME I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DO BUT IF YOU OWN THREE TV'S IN YOUR HOME. YOU THOSE ARE YOUR ASSETS YOU OWN THOSE TV'S THE TV'S. ARE INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ENTITIES THAT HAVE THEIR OWN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SO IT. IT'S HARD TO KIND OF WRAP YOUR MIND AROUND -- ACCOUNTING WAS A LONG TIME FOR ME BUT SO WE IF THERE'S MORE WE CAN PROVIDE. THAT IS THAT IT'S THAT YIELDS MEANINGFUL TRANSPARENCY AND HELPS TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION FORWARD WE'RE WE'RE WILLING TO DO IT BUT THEY'RE SIMPLY INFORMATION THAT THAT IS JUST A NON STARTER THAT DOESN'T EXIST. SO YOUR ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE FOR BASICALLY FOR KAISER I'M SURE WAS PROBABLY DESIGNED FOR KAISER THAT. SENDS ALL THE EXPENSES AND ALL THE REVENUES TO ONE FEDERAL TAX ID NUMBER AND YOU COME UP WITH WHAT THE RATE THAT IS IMPLEMENTED. FOR IT FOR YOU TO DO WHAT'S BEING OUSTED. WHAT IS A FAIR TO THIS TO SAY THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO HIRE FORENSIC ATTORNEY ACCOUNTANTS TO COME IN? AND TO DISASSOCIATE FROM THE MASTER ACCOUNTING. OF THE ACCOUNTING RELATED TO EACH RESPECTIVE HOSPITAL QUESTION ONE QUESTION. TWO IS IT FAIR TO SAY WITH YOUR THIRTY TWO HOSPITALS SUGGEST SOME HOSPITALS THAT ARE MUCH MORE PROFITABLE THAN OTHERS AND MAYBE SOME OF THE HOSPITAL'S ACTUALLY. KERRY OTHER HOSPITALS. AND IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO SAY THAT IF YOU DID THE ACCOUNTING OF EACH RESPECTIVE HOSPITAL WOULD YOU SEE DIFFERENT RATES A COULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE FOR CERTAIN AREAS. AND LESS EXPENSIVE IN OTHER AREAS. YES SIR TWO TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION I I CERTAINLY CAN'T SPEAK TO WHO WE WOULD NEED TO HIRE AN AND HOW MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE WE WOULD NEED TO HIRE I DO KNOW THAT THE MY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH ON THIS BILL HAVE BEEN VERY. CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT. THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WOULD TAKE FOR US TO ACTUALLY YOU KNOW REPORT DECEMBER WEEK WE HAVE IT WE CAN DEVELOP BUT A METHODOLOGY A SYSTEM TO TO REPORT THAT BUT THAT IS NOT A SMALL THING. I I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW BUT AGAIN THE NUMBER OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WAS WAS THROWN OUT IN AND I WILL ADMIT WE HAVE NOT. SAT AND DONE THAT YOU KNOW VERY CAREFUL MATH -- BUT IT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND IT MIGHT BE WORTH IT THERE MIGHT BE VALUE IN THAT INVESTMENT BASED ON ON WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY -- WITH RESPECT. TO HOSPITALS THAT ARE MORE PROFITABLE IN THERE THAT THAT'S JUST NOT HOW WE THINK -- CAR OUR HOSPITALS ARE ACTUALLY BEING FORCED TO THINK THAT WAY WELL WE THINK IN A WAY WHERE I THE FACT THAT OUR HOSPITALS ARE ARE ARE ESSENTIALLY ONE ENTITY IS ACTUALLY A GOOD THING WHEN IT COMES TO COSTS WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY SO FOR INSTANCE. KAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY BY ALL OF THE DRUGS. RIGHT SO WE KNOWTHE ISSUES WITH WITH PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING WE HER UP A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT -- BUYING EQUIPMENT WHEN YOU'RE BUYING MATERIAL WE'RE NOT JUST ONE HOSPITAL YOU KNOW BUYING THESE THINGS WE ARE LEVERAGING THE SIZE OF THE ORGANIZATION AND ACTUALLY THAT'S CREATING VALUE AND EFFICIENCIES AND KEEPING PRICES LOW. SO I DON'T THE I DON'T THINK WE EVEN HAVE LOW PERFORMING HOSPITALS IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU HOW YOU DEFINE THAT THE QUALITY SCORES REALLY SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES THE QUALITY SCORES FOR HOSPITALS ARE OFF THE CHARTS -- WE HAVE MEDICARE FIVE STAR HOSPITALS AND AND AND PLAN HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S I THINK HOW WHAT WE HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT IS IS THE QUALITY. I DON'T THINK WE'RE OF AFRAID OF YOU KNOW ANYTHING BAD SORT OF SHOWING UP IN THE DATA WE'RE WE'RE VERY PROUD OF IT'S JUST A MATTER OF IF YOU'RE. GETTING US TO TO SPEND THAT MONEY WE WANT TO BE SURE WERE TELLING THE TRUTH WE WANT TO BE SURE IT'S AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF OF OUR MODEL. OKAY SO WE HAVE A MOTIN BY CENTER RUBIO SOUNDS LIKE -- YOU DOCTOR PANDER TO HAVE MORE COMMUNICATIONS TOGETHER -- AND SO WITH A DOCTOR AND IF YOU LIKE CLOTHES THANK YOU THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK. THE COMMITTEE -- FOR SOME VERY THOUGHTFUL DOC CONVERSATION -- WITH WITH EVERYONE HERE -- BUT BUT I I DO I DO I MAKE SEVERAL POINTS AND REALLY TO OFF OF WHAT ABOUT -- YOU KNOW CENTER MONEY YOU YOU YOU BE MENTION LIKE OF COURSE THEY HAVE TO KNOW. HOW MUCH THEY'RE SPENDING I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU MANAGED TO ORGANIZATION WHEN YOU DON'T HOW DO YOU DECIDE HOW MUCH FOOT PREMIUM YOU CHARGE RIGHT? AND WHAT YOU NEGOTIATE. FOR AID THE ON THE ANALOGY SAY THREE TV'S AT SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT I AND I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO TO TO DO THIS BUT IT SAYS YOU HAVE THREE RENTAL PROPERTIES OKAY. YOU HAVE THREE RENTAL PROPERTIES YOU KNOW HOW MUCH EACH TENANT IN EACH PROPERTY YOU MAY BY THE TOILET PAPER FOR ALL THREE YOU KNOW I COSCO BUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TOILET PAPERS GOING TO EACH HOUSE ARE AND HOW OFTEN THEY'RE BEING USED. SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IN ORDER TO RUN THE ORGANIZATION. OKAY SO YES ALL HOSPITALS MAY BE UNDER ONE TAX ID NUMBER BUT I'M SURE THEY MUST HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING. OF FOR EACH HOSPITAL WHAT THEY'RE SPENDING HOW MUCH HOW MANY PATIENTS ARE IN THERE HOW MUCH THEY'RE SPENDING PER BED ICU BED OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AND YET IN THE REPORT. EVEN FOR ALL THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE GET WELL BLANK BLANK BLANK BLANK AND IT'S ALL ROLLED UP INTO INPATIENT OKAY SO I I DO THINK THAT IS. A BIG PROBLEM I APPRECIATE THE THE CENTER LEYVA YOU ASKED YOU YOU MENTIONED ABOUT HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLANS WELL SOMEBODY HAD TO COME UP WITH THE CALCULATION FOR HOW IF YOU ME WHEN YOU'VE MET. THAT DEDUCTIBLE. RIGHT SO SOMEBODY HAD TO THERE HAS TO BE IN EXIST NOT NOT WE GO SPEND A MILLION DOLLARS LATER. WE HAVE A PROCESS RIGHT NOW TO FIGURE OUT WHEN YOU HIT YOUR DEDUCTIBLE WHEN NOW YOU KNOW THAT YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT PAYING OUT OF POCKET WITH THAT CENTER SO THERE'S A MECHANISM AND THEN I THINK. YOU'LL MENTION CLAIMS AND YES YOU KNOW PART OF THAT THE CLAIMS DEPARTMENT MAYBE THE CLERK CLAIMS IF YOU GO TO ANOTHER E. R.. BUT I UNDERSTAND THERE'S AN INTERNAL CLAIMS DEPARTMENT TO RIGHT I MEAN IT'S SO AND AND THEY HAVE TO SIGN SOME KIND OF PRICE THAT SOMEONE'S FIGURED OUT FOR OKAY SO FORTH. TO TRACK WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN THE INSTITUTION SO AGAIN THIS IS THE DATA THAT'S BEING STE -- USED WHEN THEY NEGOTIATE AND ONE YES WHEN YOU SEE ALL THESE AS WHAT WE ARE NOT UNDER THE HOOD OKAY FINE WE'LL SHOW YOU A LITTLE BIT AND SO TEY HAVE THIS INTERNAL CLAIMS PROCESS TO INVADE EVEN TALK TO PEOPLE WORKED IN THEIR CELLS. THEY SAY YEAH WE HAVE THINGS THAT WE COULD RE TRACK AND IT'S SO I I MEAN. I APPRECIATE THAT KAISER IS A SYSTEM THAT YOU KNOW SAYS OKAY LOOK YOU KNOW WE'RE CAPITATED BY LIKE THERE ARE OTHER SYSTEMS ARE CAPITATED. OKAY ALL RIGHT AND SO WAS A CAPITATED SYSTEM YEAH WE ARE TRYING TO COME UP THE BEST VALUE IN IN KAISER REALLY IS A MODEL SYSTEM IN MARY VETS NOW IT'S IT'S IT'S THE PIONEERS A MODEL SYSTEM. AND AND AND WE WHAT I SEE WHAT PEOPLE TO LOOK MORE PEOPLE LOOK LIKE KAISER. SO IN TERMS OF THE CLINICAL ORGANIZATION AND THAT'S GOOD -- BUT I I IT TO ADMIT THAT I AM A LITTLE YOU KNOW THE SURPRISED ABOUT SAYING THAT WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH AN INSIDER ORGANIZATION. NOW I AGREE CENTER MITCH I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT AND ALSO THROUGH THAT YOU KNOW WHAT. OKAY IT MAY NOT BE EXACTLY THE SAME BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU YOU YOU IT'S IT'S NOT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT SENDING BILLS TO HEALTH AND THE TO A TO A TO A HEALTH PLAN BECAUSE IT'S PART OF OUR INTEGRATED SYSTEM BUT YOU DEFINITELY. YOU KNOW THE COST THAT YOU HAVE A COMPANY RIGHT YOU KNOW YOUR LINES OF BUSINESS RIGHT YOU KNOW WHO HE IS SO IT'S IT'S THE YOU CAN'T I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S ALL ONE BUSINESS SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN THIS LINE. AND THAT LINE AND THAT LINE OF BUSINESS YOU YOU THAT YOU KNOW. ARE YOU DON'T USUALLY PRETTY BUT YOU GET ON THE BANKRUPT SO SO ANYWAY I I'M LOOKING FOR TWO WEEKS A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE WITH KAISER BECAUSE I HAVE A TREMENDOUS ADMIRATION FOR KAISER AS AN ORGANIZATION -- BUT I ALSO KNOW YOU KNOW I'VE WORKED WITH OTHER HEALTH SYSTEMS AND AND SO FORTH. AND I A AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE WANT TO TRY TO DO IS TO ACTUALLY TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL THAT I THINK -- CENTER MITCHELL SO ARTICULATELY AT SOAP SO PROPERLY DESCRIBE THIS LIKE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION AT THE RIGHT GRANULARITY THAT ALLOWS US TO ACHIEVE OUR HEALTH OUR AIMS IN TERMS OF WHETHER IT'S REGULATORY ARE TRANSPARENCY SO THAT. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND AND THE PURCHASERS AND AND REGULATORS. KNOW WHAT NOT CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY FAIRNESS ACROSS THE OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM -- TO IT SO THAT -- WE CAN TRY TO ACHIEVE OUR AIMS AND SO I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO THAT CONRAD YEAH I'VE I WANT TO THE REASON THE BILLS IN THE FORM IT'S NOW IT'S COME STILL WAITING TO GET THAT. DIALOGUE INVOLVED WE CAN LAND SOME LANGUAGE WITH KAISER TO SAY OKAY NOW WILL COME TO AGREEMENT ABOUT THE STUBBLE GRANULARITY ETCETERA. AND AND I CAN'T SPEAK AS TO HOW MUCH WILL COST KAISER TO DO THAT BUT THERE'S A PART OF IT ALSO SAYS THERE THEY HAVE SYSTEMS TO TRACK INFORMATION NOW YOU KNOW IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN THE LITERAL SENSE OF THE BILL RIGHT NOW MAYBE NOT BUT OKAY. FINE LET'S TWEAK IT BUT SO WE CAN GET THAT EQUIVALENT INFORMATION. IN A WAY THAT'S NOT OVERLY BURDENSOME A COSTLY TO KAISER BUT THEN ALSO PROVIDES THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE FOR SUCH AN IMPORTANT PLAYER IN A HEALTH CARE MARKET WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIGHT BUT YOU CENTER PAN WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR RUBIO.
