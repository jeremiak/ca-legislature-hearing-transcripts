SENATE BILL FIFTY ONE BY SENATOR DORADO AND AFTER LEADING TO SUPER SURPLUS PROPERTY IN DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE OF TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. SENATOR ALSO THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT. SB FIFTY ONE THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE MEANINGFUL COST SAVINGS FOR THE STATE. OR PRODUCING A MODEL TO EXPAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ENHANCE HOMEOWNERSHIP. THIS BILL ALIGNS WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO FOSTER HOUSING INNOVATIONS ON EXCESS STATE OWNED LAND. FOR OVER SIXTY YEARS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DISPLAYS THE FAMILIES WHO LIVED IN WHAT IS CALLED THE SEVEN TEN CORD OR- TO BUILD A FREE WAY THROUGH THE CITIES OF LA PASADENA SOUTH PSADENA. IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ARE LEGISLATURE DECLARED NO FREEWAYS WOULD BE BUILT. WE INTRODUCED SB FIFTY ONE TO IMPLEMENT A FAIR PROCESS FOR TENANTS TO BUY THEIR HOMES AND TO BRING MORE AFFORDABLE LONG TERM HOUSING TO EL SERENO. MANY PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN SITTING VACANT AND IN DISREPAIR FOR YEARS IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. THIS BILL WILL GIVE CURRENT TENANTS THE FIRST RIGHT TO PURCHASE THE HOME IF THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED OR ABLE IT REQUIRES A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE HOUSING RELATED ENTITY. WHO PURCHASES THE PROPERTY PROVIDED FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME RENTAL HOUSING FOR AT LEAST FIFTY FIVE YEARS. THIS HOUSING RELATED ENTITIES COULD BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR NONPROFIT HOUSING ENTITIES. WHO WOULD BUY THE PROPERTIES AT THE ORIGINAL PRICE IN EXCHANGE. BROUGH REMODELING PRESERVING AFFORDABILITY AND MAINTAINING THEM. VACANT PROPERTIES ALSO WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY UNDER THIS COMMON. RENTAL THE CURRENT LAWS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON HOMEOWNERSHIP AND IS NOW OVER THIRTY YEARS OLD. IT SETS THE ORDER OF SALES BUT DOES NOT CREATE LONG TERM AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING. IF VACANT PROPERTIES WERE TO GO THROUGH THE EXISTING PROCESS THEY WOULD BE AUCTIONED OFF AND ULTIMATELY OPENED UP TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER. A RECIPE FOR GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENT. THIS BILL WAS DEVELOPED AFTER HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF CONVERSATIONS AND MEETINGS WITH RESIDENTS ADVOCATES TENDANCE LA CITY COUNTY OFFICIALS. AND TCHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. ALBEIT SOME WITH OPPOSING VIEWS. YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT AFTER SIXTY YEARS OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT THE LEVELS OF LEGITIMATE ANGER FRUSTRATION AND FEARS. THAT EXIST IN MY COMMUNITY OR I HAVE REPORT RESIDED OVER THIRTY YEARS.

MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NINE BY SENATOR RUBIO RELATIVE TO TEEN DATING VIOLENCE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH. SENATOR RUBIO THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT S. C. R. NINE WHICH PROCLAIMS FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE S. TEEN DATING VIOLENCE AWARENESS% AND PREVENTION MONTH. THIS RESOLUTION ENCOURAGES ALL CALIFORNIANS TO OBSERVE TEEN DATING VIOLENCE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH WITH PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES THAT RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT TEEN VIOLENCE THIS WEEK I PARTICIPATED IN THE ORANGE DAY RALLY WHERE INSPIRATIONAL YOUNG LEADERS SHARE THEIR PERSONAL STORIES OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. AND ARE TRULY COMMITTED TO TRYING TO PREVENT VIOLENCE FOR THEMSELVES AND- THIRTEEN- COLLEAGUES THIS ISSUE AFFECTS EVERYONE NOT JUST TEENS THEIR PARENTS THEIR TEACHERS THEIR FRIENDS AND ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. TEEN DATING VIOLENCE IS A VERY SERIOUS AND GROWING PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE KNOW ALL THE PANDEMIC HAS PUT A DISTURBING SPOTLIGHT ON INCREASING DATING VIOLENCE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS ENSURE A POSITIVE. THE POSITIVE A CLIMATE AND SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL TEENS WE MUST SUPPORT OUR TEENS EDUCATE THEM ON THE IMPORTANCE OF HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AND UP LEFT THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED VIOLENCE SO THAT THEY MAY HEAL AND MOVE FORWARD. WE MUST ENSURE OUR TEENS FOR NOT IMMERSED IN TOXIC CULTURES THAT NORMALIZES VIOLENCE AND INSTEAD ENCOURAGES. HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS I WANT TO THANK THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR SPONSORING THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION AND THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS MEMBERS WHO ALSO CO AUTHORED THIS RESOLUTION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS S. C. R. NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I RISE TODAY IS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF S. C. R. NINE WHICH DESIGNATES FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS TEEN DATING VIOLENCE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH TEEN DATING VIOLENCE IS A SERIOUS ISSUE IMPACTING FAR TOO MANY CALIFORNIA YOUTH. ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION NEARLY ONE IN ELEVEN FEMALE TEENS AND ONE IN FIFTEEN MALE TEENS REPORT HAVING EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL DATING VIOLENCE IN THE LAST YEAR. THE CHAIR OF SENATE EDUCATION I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT EDUCATION AND OUTREACH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN ALL LEARN HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE WARNING SIGNS. THIS TYPE OF ABUSE IS TRULY DAMAGING AND LONG LASTING. IT CAN CONTAIN CLUED REDUCED ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT INCREASED LIKELIHOOD THAT VICTIMS WILL SMOKE OR USE DRUGS. DRUGS ENGAGE IN UNHEALTHY DIETING A RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIORS. I READ SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING READ RECENTLY. AND IT SAYS THIS. DON'T TELL YOUR DAUGHTER THAT WHEN A BOY IS MEAN OR RUDE TO HER IT'S BECAUSE HE HAS A CRUSH ON HER. DON'T TELL HER THAT ABUSE IS A SIGN OF LOVE. I HOPE YOU'LL ALL JOIN ME TODAY IN WORKING TOWARDS A WORLD WHERE NO YOUNG PEOPLE WILL EVER EXPERIENCED THIS ABUSE. BY AN AYE VOTE ON IS HERE NINE. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER. ZERO MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE AS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF F. E. R. NINE. DATA SHOWS THAT IF YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO ENGAGE IN. VIOLENCE TOWARDS YOUR PARTNER AS AN ADOLESCENT FOR YOUR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO EXPERIENCED SUCH VIOLENCE WHEN WE REFER TO THIS VIOLENCE WE'RE NOT REFERRING ONLY TO PHYSICAL YOU'RE REFERRING TO ALSO INTIMIDATION COERCIVE CONTROL AND OTHER FORMS OF IN FACT DOMINANCE OVER PARTNER. THAT THAT DATA INDICATES THAT A FIFTEEN. ANYONE WHO EITHER EXPERIENCES IT OR ACT UPON IT AT THAT AGE IS FAR MORE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO BEHAVIOR EITHER AS THE VICTIM OR AS THE PERPETRATOR SO THE SOONER THAT WE CAN INTERVENE INTERJECT AND STOP THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR. AND HELP. HELLO THE YOUNG PERSON UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT IS DRIVING WHAT UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES DRIVING THAT BEHAVIOUR THE MORE LIKELY WE WILL HAVE. ADULTS WHO ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THAT AND ADULTS WHO ARE NOT VICTIM TO IT SO IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS WE JUST PAY ATTENTION TO LATER IN LIFE- I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT AS DOES THE WOMEN'S POCKETS AND I AFTER I DON'T. THANK YOU SIR SENATOR EGGMAN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS- I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE LGBT CAUCUS TO SAY. THAT TEEN VIOLENCE HAPPENS ACROSS ACROSS GENDERS ACROSS RELATIONSHIPS L. G. B. T. Q. KIDS ARE EVEN MORE AT RISK FOR THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO NOT BE OUT TO THEIR FAMILIES  TALK TO AND TO BE ABLE TO SUFFER IN SILENCE. THE ABUSE CAN TAKE FORMS OF PHYSICAL MENTAL AND AS WELL AS THREATEN PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR THEIR PRIVACY AND THEN COMING OUT AND BEING ADDED. IT IS- IT IS A PLETHORA OF ISSUES THAT LGBTQ YOUTH FACE SO AS WE STAND. UP AGAINST TEEN VIOLENCE DATING VIOLENCE MAYBE ALSO REMEMBER TO INCLUDE. ALL OF US WHO WHO WHO COULD BE SUFFERING THIS AND AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LOOK OUT FOR OUR OUR OUR MOST VULNERABLE I STRONGLY OCCURRED AND COURAGE I ON S. C. R. NINE. THE CENTER SO PAN.

AND WHAT SHE TELLS ME ALL THE TIME IS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS TOO OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD BY POLICYMAKERS AND LEGISLATORS THE REALITY OF TV IS THAT IT COMES IN MANY FORMS AFFECTS MANY AGE GROUPS AND SPENT TOO OFTEN STARTS WITH TEENAGERS ONE IN THREE HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS WILL EXPERIENCED TEEN DATING VIOLENCE WITH FARMS INCLUDING PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INJURY REPRODUCTIVE COERCION AND OTHER HORRIFIC FARMS.
