THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I TO JUST ONE MONTH THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS COMMONSENSE MASURE AND THE WITNESSES WHO'VE COME BEFORE SHE DAY. IT MAKES NO SENSE AND A FAIR AND JUST SOCIETY THAT WOULD PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES TO SOMEONE WHO HAS COMMITTED A CRIME. AND HAS BEEN RELEASED VERSUS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN WRONG WRONGFULLY CONVICTED. AND HELD -- WHETHER IT'S ONE YEAR SEVENTEEN YEARS OR TWENTY YEARS -- THEY DESERVE SOMETHING THEY SHOULD JUST BE LEFT OUT ON THE STREET SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN EXPAND UPON THIS AS WE DEAL WITH. CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM HERE AND CALIFORNIA AND JUST FAIRNESS AND THIS IS JUST THE ISSUE OF COMMONSENSE FAIRNESS SO I THINK DOCTOR BEFORE LEADERSHIP. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES I I REALLY I THINK MY THE SUPPORTERS AND OBVIOUSLY THANK MISTER ANTHONY FOR COMING HERE I THINK FOR MOST OF US IT WOULD BE INCONCEIVABLE -- FIRST OF ALL TO BE INCARCERATED IT'S IT'S THAT IN ITSELF IS IS SOMETHING THAT IS DIFFICULT. YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW YOU FEEL IF YOU WOULD THEIR WRONGFULLY THAT YOU DID NOT COMMIT THE CRIME. AND AND THE PROCESS YOU LOSE YOUR FAMILY YOU LOSE SHELVE RELATIVES PEOPLE HAVE DIED SINCE YOU'VE BEEN INCARCERATED AND YOU COME OUT WITHOUT OFTENTIMES WITHOUT CONNECTIONS. TO THE PRESENT YOUR FAMILY AS WELL AS OTHERS AND SO AT THE YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW YOU FEEL THE TWO BEEN TRULY WRONG AND THEN YOU COME OUT AND YOU'VE LOST. ALL YOUR WORK HISTORY YOU'VE LOST A JOB THAT YOU HAD LOST THE HOUSES THE RESOURCES AND HAVE TO START ALL OVER. AND WE DON'T PROVIDE ENOUGH SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE TO START OVER AND WE ALL KNOW THAT HOUSING IS CRITICAL IN TERMS OF STABILIZING ANY FAMILY ANY GROUP OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK FOR A JOB. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMETHING STABLE THAT THEY CAN HAVE IT'S AN ADDRESS THAT'S IMPORTANT SO THIS IS A MODEST REQUEST BUT I I I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT LIFE WOULD BE LIKE IF YOU WERE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED. OF THE EMOTIONS THE HEARTACHE THE PAIN AND THEN FOR PEOPLE TO EVEN STILL HOLD YOU SOMEHOW ANOTHER GUILTY BECAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT IT THAT THAT THAT HAPPENED TO YOU -- SO I THINK I I RESPECTFULLY ASK WE AYE BOTH OF THOSE WHO'VE BEEN WRONGFULLY LOSING THEIR LIBERTY AND FREEDOM AND MOVING THEM FROM THAT FAMILIES AT THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS TRY TO PROVIDE THEM WITH A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE I PULLED. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE GUYS. BUT LET'S DO A ROLL CALL THE MOTION IS TO PASS. TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER HI THERE I MOORLACH. FOR LIKE AYE BRADFORD BRADFORD AYE JACKSON MITCHELL MORALE [inaudible] WIENER. I WILL HAVE THE BILL AND CALL TO MY MISSING MEMBERS ARE ABLE TO ADD ON HERE THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU. LET'S GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES ITEM ONE AB ONE THIRTY FIVE GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL ONE THIRTY FIVE TODAY THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY RE INTRODUCTION OF ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH THIS COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED. THIS BILL WILL CLOSE A LOOPHOLE THAT HAS EMERGED WITH THE GROWING USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA BY HUMAN TRAFFICKING RINGS ACCORDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE IS AN ALARMING TREND OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. HI BY USING THE INTERNET USING SOCIAL MEDIA SITES POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA SITES SUCH AS INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK TO WAR POTENTIAL VICTIMS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALONG FORSMAN TASK FORCE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SET UP A DECOY ACCOUNT -- IS SOLICITING HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS PART OF A STING OPERATION THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WERE TAKEN ABACK BY HOW MUCH TRAFFIC WAS GENERATED BY THESE ACCOUNTS. THE TEMPS TO TROPIC USING SOCIAL MEDIA HAS A REAL IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN. A QUICK THINKING TICKET AGENT SUCCESSFULLY STOP TWO TEENAGERS ARE FROM BOARDING A FLIGHT AT SACRAMENTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE TWO TEENAGERS WERE ATTEMPTING TO FLY TO NEW YORK AFTER TRAFFICKERS CONTACTED THEM. OVER INSTAGRAM PROMISING THEM MODELING OPPORTUNITIES LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BELIEVE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAFFIC IT HAD THEY'VE FLOWN TO NEW YORK. THIS BILL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE EXISTING LAW ONLY PENALIZES HUMAN TRAFFICKERS WHO ACTUALLY INDUCED OR PERSUADED MINOR TO ENGAGE IN A COMMERCIAL SEX ACT. THERE'S NO PENALTIES FOR THE MIDDLE MAN IN THAT CHAIN THE INDIVIDUAL WHO CONTACTS A MINOR OVER SOCIAL MEDIA TO PUT THEM IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY'RE AT RISK OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN. IN THE SACRAMENTO AIRPORT EXAMPLE THAT I JUST GAVE THE INDIVIDUAL WHO CONTACTED THE TWO TEENS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN HELD CRIMINALLY LIABLE. THEIR INVOLVEMENT SPECIFICALLY ARRANGING THE FLIGHT TO NEW YORK MAYBE TOO ATTENUATED FROM THE INDUCEMENT OF COMMITTING A COMMERCIAL SEX ACT. THAT IS REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW. ASSEMBLY BILL ONE THIRTY FIVE WILL CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE THAT DANGEROUS LOOPHOLE TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN ARE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY BY MAKING IT A FELONY TO CONTACT A MINOR WITH THE INTENT TO ENGAGE IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING. HOW WITH ME TODAY THIS MORNING IT IS MY HONOR TO HAVE ALL THE MEANING COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY? NANCY O'MALLEY THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. THE MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THIS BILL IS REALLY AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES SAID IS ABOUT CONTACTING OR LOWERING. A MINOR FOR COMMERCIAL SEX. AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WHAT WHAT IS ABSENT IN THE LAW RIGHT NOW IS HOLDING PURCHASERS RESPONSIBLE. RIGHT NOW THE WAY THE LAW IS STRUCTURED THAT THE SAME PUNISHMENT EXISTS FOR SOMEBODY WHO. SOLICITS AND IT AN ADULT WHO SOLICITS AN ADULT SEX WORKER AS IT IS FOR AN ADULT WHO SOLICITING A MINOR FOR SEX FOR COMMERCIAL SEX. THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE IN THE PUNISHMENT AND THIS BILL IS REALLY DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE PURCHASERS OF CHILDREN. MY OFFICE HAS BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT OF ADDRESSING HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT WE HAVE OVER FIFTY CASES PENDING. AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN WE HAVE PROSECUTOR WERE. SIX HUNDRED HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES INVOLVING CHILDREN ALL TRAFFICKERS. I AND WE'RE BUT VERY LITTLE IS DONE TO THE PURCHASERS. WE KNOW ALSO THAT WE HAVE A DE QUOI WEBSITE AS WELL AND ON A MONTHLY BASIS WE HAVE OVER TWO THOUSAND HITS. OF ADULT MEN WHO ARE SEEKING TO BUY CHILDREN NOT ADULT SEX WORKERS BUT CHILDREN FOR SEX. AND OF COURSE WE'VE ALL SEEN THE DATELINE STORIES WHERE THEY SHOW UP AT A HOUSE. TWO THIRTY SIX POINT A POINT ONE SEE ADDRESSES THE TRAFFICKER Q. PEOPLE ARE TRAFFICKING CHILDREN. AND TWO THIRTY SIX POINT ONE D. SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES. OUT HOW WE DETERMINE IF A CHILD HAS BEEN LOWERED OR INDUCED INTO TRAFFICKING AND IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS LOOKING AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHILD AND THE TRAFFICKER. BUT NO WE'RE TWO THIRTY SIX POINT ONE DOES IT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE PURCHASERS WERE AS IT FROM THE CALIFORNIA SEX OFFENDER MANAGEMENT BOARD WHICH I CHAIR -- WE HAVE ADDED HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE ARE NOW STUDYING AND RESEARCHING BECAUSE WHAT WE DETERMINED. INITIALLY IS THAT WITH OUR INITIAL RESEARCH IS THAT PURCHASERS OF CHILDREN FOR SEX ARE ON THE SPECTRUM FOR SEX OFFENDERS AND YET THERE'S NO CRIME. THAT EXISTS TO PUNISH PEOPLE THAT ARE. THAT ARE LITTERING OR TRYING TO BUY CHILDREN FOR SEX. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW TWO EIGHTY EIGHT A OF WHICH WHICH ONLY APPLIES TO CHILDREN UNDER FOURTEEN IS A PROTECTION FOR MINORS BUT THOSE CHILDREN THERE BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND SEVENTEEN HAVE NO PROTECTION. UNDER OUR LAW A AND THIS BILL WOULD REALLY AT PROVIDE THAT KIND OF PROTECTION. HELLO SO ADD THAT. AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I KNOW THIS TO THE HEAT INSTITUTE WHICH IS A RESEARCH INSTITUTE I HAVE -- THAT AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF MINERS ARE BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND SEVENTEEN AND AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY ARE GIRLS OF COLOR -- WE'RE FOCUSING NOW ON BOYS AND THE IMPACT ON BOYS AND THE SOLICITATION OF BOYS. AND THAT RESEARCH IS UNDERWAY BUT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A CRIME WHERE THOSE CHILDREN ARE UNPROTECTED FROM. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING THEM FOR SEX. AND WITHOUT I JUST URGE OF NOT NOT A VOTE TO MOVE THIS BILL ALONG THANK YOU [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. ENTER MEMBERS STAND FOR THE SALT ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT DISTRICT ATTORNEY O'MALLEY STATED OUR OFFICES IN STRONG SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MORNING MANAGER -- MEMBERS COREY CELLS ALONG BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THE MORNING BRANDED UP ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR NUMBERS MELANIE CUEVAS WITH CAN TANA WATSON HEARD MEN ON BEHALF OF CAST THE COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ARE ATTENDING ON BEHALF OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER STUFF IN AND SUPPORT. THE MORE YOU LEARN MORE SOME BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION THE ANALYSIS IN ADVERSE LEE LISTED US AS AN OPPOSITION. WHEN IN FACT WE ARE VERY ENTHUSIASTICALLY IN SUPPORT? THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THERE ARE. LESLIE CALDWELL -- CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- IN OPPOSITION FIRST WE DO WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY PERSON AUTHOR ON THIS BILL -- AND HER STAFF -- FOR THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD HOWEVER WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS BILL I ALSO HAVE A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH -- DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY WHO IS CLEARLY VERY VERY WISE AND EDUCATED ON THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC I WANT TO BE CLEAR CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS OFFICE ISN'T. AS HORRIFIED BY HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS ANYONE. HOWEVER THIS BILL -- IS NOT. THE RIGHT. APPROACH -- DA O'MALLEY SAYS THAT IT FOCUSES ON THE PURCHASER HOWEVER MY CONCERN IS THAT WE HAD SEVERAL LAWYERS REVIEWING THE BILL AND IS CLEARLY SUBJECT TO MISINTERPRETATION IF THAT WAS. THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR. WE DO BELIEVE IT'S WELL INTENTIONED THE BILL IS NOT NECESSARY. THERE'S A MYRIAD OF STATUTES PROVIDING PUNISHMENT FOR COMMERCIAL SEX ACT AS WELL SEX ACTS AS WELL AS USING PAYING OR EMPLOYING MINORS TO COMMIT COMMERCIAL SEX ACTS. I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO DETAIL -- ABOUT PENAL CODE SECTION TWO THIRTY SIX POINT ONE SUBDIVISION C. BUT IT DOES COVER THESE ACTS. AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT IT COULD CRIMINALIZE BEHAVIOR THAT ARE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE BILL. FOR INSTANCE YOU HAVE TWO SISTERS WHO ARE BEING ABUSED AT HOME AND THEY DISCUSS RUNNING AWAY. THEY OF ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE MONEY AND THEY'RE GOING TO BECOME. PROSTITUTES BECAUSE THEY CAN MAKE GOOD MONEY THAT WAY AND THEY SHARE THAT. THOUGHT WITH ONE OF THE ONE OF THE YOUNG WOMEN SOME. MINOR BOYFRIEND WHO SAYS HE CAN HELP THEM FIND WORK AS SEX WORKERS IN THIS SCENARIO ALL THREE WOULD HAVE COMMITTED A FELONY WITH THE INTENT TO COMMIT. HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT THE INTENTION OF THIS THE BILL REALLY IS AND WE ALREADY HAVE LIKE I SAID. THESE ACTS -- THAT. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND THE AUTHOR WANT TO COVER WE HAVE THAT IN THE LAW. SO IN CONCLUSION OBVIOUSLY VIOLATING PENAL CODE SECTION TWO EIGHTY EIGHT POINT THREE BY CONTACTING OR COMMUNICATING WITH THE MINOR TO VIOLATE PENAL CODE SECTION TWO THIRTY SIX POINT. ONE DUPLICATES WHAT PENAL CODE SECTION TWO THIRTY SIX POINT ONE ALREADY PROHIBITS [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING CATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- I WILL JUST ECHO THE THE COMMENTS OF OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM FROM C. PDA AND SAY THAT WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THE CONDUCT THAT AT ISSUE IS ALREADY -- IS ALREADY SUBJECT TO CRITICIZE A SEVERE CRIMINAL PENALTIES UNDER EXISTING LAW -- WE ARE JOURNAL PHONE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IGNITES YOUR HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE OPPOSE FOR THE SAME REASONS. I'M COMMENT SIR QUESTIONS BY MY COLLEAGUES EXCUSE ME IF I COULD JUST ADD MINE BOB SOLUTIONS. AT TECH CARRILLO MEMBER OF THE US SACRAMENTO CHAPTER OF THE ACLU THANK YOU. IN STRONG OPPOSITION I'M. I WILL COMMENT IBM. HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS ABHORRENT. IT IS ON THE RISE. IT ATTACKS VULNERABLE YOUNG PEOPLE. WE KNOW THE DATE AROUND -- THAT IT'S ARE. OUR CHILDREN THAT ARE IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM ARE HIGHLY LIKELY TO BE TRAFFICKED. AND WE DO WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STOP HUMAN TRAFFICKING. HOWEVER A NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR DID GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED A VERY SIMILAR IF NOT THE SAME BILL. LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE. AND I KNOW THE SEAL USE COMMENTS AND SO [inaudible] I I'M TORN ON THIS BILL BECAUSE I WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD. NOT TO ADD SUPERFLUOUS CRIMES WERE TO ADD CRIMES THAT COULD BE MISINTERPRETED. AND PUT -- PEOPLE THAT. AT RISK THAT FOR SAY A FELONY THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE NOT BE. AND THERE'S BY THE VETO MESSAGE ALONE. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THERE IS EXISTING STATUTE. MANY THAT COULD COVER THIS SO -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR -- LAST YEAR THE BILL BIT SO RIGHT MENTIONED EARLIER THEY GOT WIDE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE. ARE WITH THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION WE ARE EAGER I'D LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS THE VETO AND IS ABOUT WHETHER THIS BILL IS REDUNDANT. BUT WHAT WERE INTERESTED TO TO SEE IF THIS GOVERNOR THIS NEW GOVERNOR WILL BE INTERESTED IN SIGNING THIS LAW IN PARTICULAR -- THIS BILL INTO LAW AS YOU KNOW I I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR D. A. O'MALLEY WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON THESE CASES -- HER ENTIRE CAREER HI IN I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S AFTERWARDS AS WELL WELL IF YOU COULD ADDRESS PUBLIC DEFENDER SINCE I DIRECT I COULD ADDRESS THE PUBLIC RIGHT UNDERSTATED SO THE CONCERN THE HYPOTHETICAL ABOUT THE BOYFRIEND SISTER COMMUNICATION FIRSTLY. THE CONDUCT WOULD ALREADY BE PROHIBITED UNDER AYE PENAL CODE SECTION TWENTY THREE SIX POINT ONE BY HELPING THE TWO SISTERS ESCAPE OR ENCOURAGING ONE OF THE SISTERS TO ENGAGE IN A SEX TRAFFICKING. INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE CAUSING OR IN DO YOU SEE IN THEM IN VIOLATION OF PENAL CODE TWENTY THREE SIX POINT. ONE I IN ADDITION AT THESE IN THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE -- WE DID ATTEMPT TO WORK WITH THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE SHOULD DRESS THEIR CONCERNS AS THEY MENTION THE ONLY SUGGESTED AMENDMENT THAT WE RECEIVED -- WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE AT THE TIME AND THEY BELIEVE THAT CRAZY WERNER GREATER A LARGER LOOPHOLE I DID ALREADY EXISTS -- TO IN THE CURRENT GOVERNING STRUCTURE I WHICH IS WHY WE BELIEVE THIS BILL SO IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS NOW AND CONTINUE TO MOVE AFFORD. HI TO PROTECT. OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE AT RISK EVERY SINGLE DAY IN UNFORTUNATELY AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA IS A HUB FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATUS QUO IS CURRENTLY NOT ACCEPTABLE WHICH IS WHY WE WANT TO CONTINUE PUSHING THIS BILL. FOR AND TO WORK WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION I TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. DEAR MILLION MAY RESPOND BRIEFLY. YES I I'M FOR ME. I AGREE THAT THE LAW IS VERY STRONG AGAINST TRAFFICKERS I DON'T AGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS OF THE TEENAGERS BUT AS SOMEONE WHO HAS LOOKED AT THESE CASES FOR PURPOSES OF CHARGING. I CAN SAY THAT I'M FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN WHO ARE BEING SOLICITED. BY PURCHASERS THAT THE PUNISHMENT FOR SOMEONE WHO SOLICITS FOR SEX FOR COMMERCIAL SEX IS A MISDEMEANOR WITH ESSENTIALLY NO TIME ATTACHED. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ADULT SOLICITING AN ADULT SEX WORKER FROM AN ADULT WHO'S SOLICITING AND LOOKING FOR ITS. VERY SPECIFICALLY FOR CHILDREN TO BUY. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT POPULATION. AND THERE IS NO OTHER BILL BESIDE SIX FORTY SEVEN BE A IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS A BILL THAT I SPONSORED. BROKE SIX FORTY SEVEN BE THE ONE SOLICITATION STATUTE IN THE LAW. BROKEN INTO THREE SUBSECTIONS A WAS THE THE NUMBER ONE ADULT SOLICITING TO SELL BE WAS AN ADULT SOLICITING AN ADULT SEX WORKER AND SEASON ADULTS SOLICITING A MINOR. BUT THE PUNISHMENT IS NOT DIFFERENT. AND WE KNOW THE BEHAVIOR AND THE THE MENTALITY OF THE PURCHASER TROLLING OUR STREETS OR TROLLING THE INTERNET SPECIFICALLY FOR CHILDREN. IS A VERY DIFFERENT THAN ADULT WHO'S ENGAGING IN ADULT SEX WORKER SO THIS BILL IS THE ONLY BILL RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD EXIST. TO ADDRESS THOSE PURCHASERS. AND GIVE PROTECTION FOR THOSE YOUTH THAT ARE NOT UNDER FOURTEEN WHICH THERE ARE PLENTY OF LAWS FOR THAT. BUT BETWEEN FOURTEEN AND SEVENTEEN WHERE THEY'RE PRACTICALLY NO LAWS AND AGAIN THESE ARE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN WERE PUT IN AS YOU KNOW PUT IN THE MOST VULNERABLE PART OF CIRCUMSTANCES THERE ARE NO OTHER LAWS THAT ADDRESS. THAT PURCHASER FOR THIS POPULATION. SO I DON'T WANNA GET INTO DIALOGUE RIGHT NOW BUT I JUST NOTE THAT IN YOUR OPENING YOU TALKED ABOUT THOSE WHO WOULD LOWER NOT TO JOHN. AND SO -- NOW THE PURCHASER THAT'S THE JOHN THAT'S NOT THE PERSON LEARNING SOMEONE DEMON SEX TRAFFICKING SO THIS IS PART OF WHY I AM CONFLICTED ON THIS BILL -- AND I IT'S CLEARLY BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF THE SUBJECT A HARD BILL TO OPPOSE BECAUSE ALL OF US WANT TO END HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND YET IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT WE REALLY. REQUIRE IT ON THE BOOKS SO I'M MAY STAY OFF TODAY -- AND I AND I AND AS I SAID TORN I DON'T HAVE A HARD RECOMMENDATION TO THE COMMITTEE. ON BERMAN SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. I'M OF THE BILL. ALL RIGHT AN ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHICH LIKE CLOSE YES I I RESPECTFULLY AUSTRALIA VOTE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION SHOULD THIS BILL GET OUT. RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION LET'S TO ROLL CALL. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. MORE LOCK MORE LIKE AYE BRADFORD JACKSON MITCHELL. MORALE. WELL I AM WIENER. WE'LL KEEP THE BILL ON CALL. AND WE'LL HAVE SOME MAPS MEMBERS WHO ARE RETURNING THANKS. RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO WILL GO TO ITEM TWO AB THREE HUNDRED ASSEMBLYMEMBER TO YOU MAY BEGIN TO MODERN CHAIRS AND SENATORS. IN ON THE FURS ARE LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE OR OR OR STRUGGLE WITH THE AB. THREE HUNDRED ALL RIGHT AND I LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH ME. AND MY STAFF ON THIS BILL I THE SEPTIC COMMITTEE. AMENDMENT THIS BILL REQUIRES THE INFORMATIONAL INCIDENT AND CRIME REPORT USED BY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO INCLUDE A CHECK BOX INDICATING WHETHER. THE CASE AT HAND IS. SUSPECTED HATE CRIME OR A HATE INCIDENT. IT ALSO REQUIRED THAT FOR EACH HATE CRIME OR HATE INCIDENT THE AGENCY MUST COMPLETE A CERTAIN AMOUNT TO REPORT SUBMITS FOR US TO FIND A TYPE OF BIAS MOTIVATION INVOLVED. AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT WILL HELP AID. IN THE INVESTIGATION OR PROSECUTION OF THE CASE. AB THREE HUNDRED HATE CRIMES AND HATE INCIDENTS SINCE OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE ACCURATELY IDENTIFIED REPORTER AND INVESTIGATED. THIS BILL ACTUALLY STAYING FROM -- BUT ALL THE REPORT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH I WORK WITH. OTHER MEMBERS IN SOME CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS TO REQUEST. THE REPORT SUGGESTS THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY UPDATE THEIR POLICY AND PROCEDURES ON THE HAY CRYING AND IMPLEMENT. A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING THE TIME TO DO THIS IS NOW BECAUSE TO HATE CRIMES ARE ON THE RISE IN CALIFORNIA. WITH ME. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IS OF GREAT DE JUROR FROM ARC CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MAY START. GOOD TO HEAR SPEAKING FOR THE ARK AND UNITED THROUGH HEALTHY CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION. A COALITION OF PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES FRIENDS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS THE AUDIT REPORT THAT. YOU REFERRED. TO I HAD A TITLE WHICH SAYS PRETTY CLEARLY WHAT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE REPORT WAS. THE TITLE WAS LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS NOT ADEQUATELY IDENTIFIED REPORTED OR RECKONED RESPONDED TO TO HATE CRIMES. YOU MAY HAVE BEEN TOLD YOU MAY BE TOLD TODAY. THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ALREADY COLLECT ALL THE INFORMATION. NECESSARY FOR THAT -- THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE -- ANY IMPACT MANY DO THERE ARE MEN THERE MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS A DIRECT. HOWEVER THE AUDIT. REPORT THREE OF THE THE CONCLUSIONS ARE ARE -- SAY OTHERWISE. NUMBER ONE NONE OF THE AGENCIES THAT THE AUDITORS DID A DEEP DIVE INTO HAD ADEQUATE TOOLS TO IDENTIFY HATE CRIMES. NUMBER. TWO TWO OF THE FOUR AGENCIES HAD NO SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FORMS THE PATROL OFFICERS NEED TO IDENTIFY HATE CRIMES NUMBER. THREE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE UNDER REPORTS HATE CRIMES STATISTICS BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SUBMIT WHAT IT CALLED INCOMPLETE AND INACCURATE INFORMATION -- ONE ONE OF THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDIT REPORT LISTED HERE AND THERE. ACTUALLY. IS THE THAT IS TO IMPLEMENT SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. HERE IS THE LOS ANGELES. POLICE DEPARTMENT'S SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT FORM IT'S TWO PAGES LONG. IT ASKS FOR COMPLETE INFORMATION ON BIAS MOTIVATION WHICH IS. PART OF THE DEFINITION OF WHAT HE CRIME IS WITHOUT INFORMATION A BUYER'S INFORMATION NOBODY EVER KNOW HAD CAMERAS REPORTED NOBODY EVER GETS CONVICTED AND OF THE THIS THIS GIVES THE SUPERVISORS IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE D. A.'S THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO REPORT IT STATISTICALLY THEY CRIME AND DETERMINE WHETHER TO PROSECUTE IT. AS A CRIME. THE TRIGGER FOR COMPLETING THIS OF LITTLE REPORT FORM IS A HATE CRIMES CHECK BOX ON THE AGENCIES STANDARD FORM AGAIN SO THAT AGAIN AS THE BILL REQUIRES. AND AS MANY AGENCIES ALREADY DO. SB LAPD IN PARTICULAR SAID THAT WHEN THEY IMPLEMENTED THAT TO THEM WHEN THEY ADDED A CHECK BOX TO THEIR THEIR HE GRABBED TO THEIR STANDARD A CRIMES REPORTS. IT INCREASED THE NUMBER OF A CRIME REPORTS WHICH SINCE WE KNOW FROM FEDERAL STATISTICS HATE CRIMES ARE GREATLY UNDER REPORTED ANY INCREASE CAN ONLY BECAUSE IT. WAS A WE SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CLOSE BURKE HEARING BEHALF OF THE JEWS PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE J. PACK AND EIGHTY ALIENATED FROM ACTUALLY.

OFFENSE TYPE AND LOCATION OF THE OFFENSE -- THE DETAILS OF REPORT WILL SHOW WHETHER OR NOT AN INCIDENT IS SUSPECTED HATE CRIME -- AND WHETHER. THAT SHOULD BE ACTED UPON IT'S UNCLEAR HOW IT CHECK BOX ITSELF WHICH IS ALL THIS BILL REQUIRES. WE'LL GET TO THAT NEXT STEP OR WILL CREATE SOME SORT OF REMEDY TO THE ISSUE THAT THE AUTHOR IN THE PROPONENTS HAVE REYES WHICH IS THAT THERE IS UNDER REPORTING OR INCOMPLETE REPORTING OF HATE CRIME INCIDENTS.

EONS THE PERSON WHO CALLED FOR EMERGENCY ACTUALLY TALKED TO A DISPATCHER THAT NOT HAD ANY FORMAL TRAINING BUT HAD OBVIOUSLY THE SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES TO HELP THAT. INDIVIDUAL DE ESCALATE THE SITUATION AND TELL A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THAT WAS TRAINED IN CRISIS INTERVENTION WAS ABLE TO CALM AND SUCCESSFULLY -- HANDLE THE SITUATION SO NOT ONLY WITH THIS TRAINING HELP THOSE DISPATCHERS -- ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE THOSE SAME SKILLS THAT THIS UNIQUE DISPATCHER HAD TO HELP WITH THE SITUATION. IT WOULD ALSO HELP -- IN CONNECTING ERVICES. THE THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO ALSO HELP DIVERT PEOPLE LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND A CRISIS AND THEIR FAMILIES INTO SERVICES RATHER THAN INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. SO THE DISPENSER BATCHES WILL BE TRAINED ALSO IN THEIR LOCAL AREAS TO IDENTIFY -- SPECIFIC RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE SO FOR INSTANCE IN LA THEY HAVE A CRISIS INTERVENTION AND RESPONSE UNIT THAT COULD COME OUT TO THE DISPATCHERS WOULD UNDERSTAND AND KNOW WHO TO CONNECT TO AN WHO TO CALL. SO NOT ONLY WOULD IT HELP DE ESCALATE CONNECTED SERVICES BUT IT WOULD ALSO DIVERT FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND SO THAT IS WHY WE ARE THE SPONSORS AND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. X. WITNESS GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ADRIAN SHELTON WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE WE ARE ALSO PROUD TO SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL. SIX EIGHTY AND JOIN NAMI CALIFORNIA AND MANY OTHER MENTAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS AND CALLING FOR THIS BILL. NOT ME CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE POLICY ADVOCATES FOR DECADES AND PROMOTING THE VISION THAT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SOMEONE IN A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BE SAFE AND ACCOMMODATING AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS LEGISLATION GIVES DISPATCHERS THE TOOLS AND THE TRAINING THAT THEY NEED TO FACILITATE SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY OF ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SOMEONE IN A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. THIS TRAINING REQUIREMENT WILL ENSURE THAT DISPATCHERS PROVIDE THE MOST ACCURATE INFORMATION TO THOSE WHO CALL AND ULTIMATELY PROTECT THE COMMUNITY AND THE PEACE OFFICERS WHO ARE RESPONDING. WE FURTHER BELIEVE THAT THIS LEGISLATION BUILDS ON THE EXCELLENT WORK THAT POST HAS BEEN DOING WITH REGARD TO THE TRAINING STANDARDS FOR CRISIS INTERVENTION TRAINING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND ALSO THE WORK THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE TO PAIR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO ACROSS CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ARE DEPENDING ON DISPATCHERS AND THEY'RE OFTEN.

I DID WRONG [inaudible] ONE DID [inaudible] SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN AND I AM SO SORRY THEY GAVE ME TORONTO AREA. I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING -- THE FOLLOWING TWO TECHNICAL. AMENDMENTS REPLACING THE TERM JUDICIAL WITH THE PUBLIC. AND REMOVING POTENTIAL FROM THE TERM FUTURE POTENTIAL BENEFITS. TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN A BILL THAT SIMPLY CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW AND CODIFIES APPELLATE COURT CASES ARE PLEA BARGAINS. PLEA BARGAINS ARE BENEFICIAL TOOLS THAT ALLOW PROSECUTORS TO REACH EXPEDITIOUS RESOLUTION SOME CASES IN EXCHANGE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT PROSECUTORS CAN USE TO BRING TO JUSTICE AND MORE DIFFICULT CASES. COURTS HAVE FOUND THAT FOR PLEA BARGAINS TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL A DEFENDANT MUST ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT KNOWINGLY. INTELLIGENTLY INVOLUNTARILY. ADDITIONALLY COURTS HAVE RULED THAT PLEA BARGAINS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE THE LEGISLATURE OR VOTERS MAKE ANY CHANGES IN STATE LAW THAT WOULD AFFECT THE AGREEMENT. UNFORTUNATELY A RECENT LOWER COURT DECISION HAS CREATED SOME CONFUSION ABOUT HOW STATE LAW SHOULD APPLY TO PLEA BARGAINS ANY ABILITY OF DEPENDS TO SIGN AWAY THEIR RIGHTS UNDER FUTURE LEGISLATION. TO CLEAR UP THIS CONFUSION AB SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN WHICH SIMPLY STATE THAT TO STAY THE SAME THE STATE THAT TO STAY CONSISTENT WITH APPELLATE COURT DECISIONS AND LONGSTANDING. JURISPRUDENCE A STATE DEPENDENT IS NOT ABLE TO SIGN AWAY THEIR RIGHTS UNDER FUTURE LEGISLATION. THIS IS A SENSIBLE CHANGE THAT. FOR PRESERVES THE INTEGRITY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS ENSURES THAT CHANGES MADE IN STATE LAW BY THIS BODY OR THE VOTERS. ARE NOT CIRCUMVENT IT OR USURPED BY LOCAL PROSECUTORS FOR THE MORE NO ONE SHOULD BE ASKED TO SIGN AWAY RIGHTS WHEN THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THOSE RIGHTS ARE. WE HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE WITH PROSECUTORS SO THAT WE CAN PRESERVE THE EXISTING SYSTEM A PLEA BARGAINS. THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I WILL. THANK YOU SEVEN REMEMBER LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION LESLIE CALDWELL IN SUPPORT.-KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. NEEDS HIM ALLEY ALAMEDA COUNTY DA IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU ALL RIGHT -- ANY OTHER TRAINERS. ALL RIGHT ANY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY SEEING NONE I WANTED THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL -- I THINK WE HAVE -- OVER THE YEARS. WE HAVE REVISITED AND LOOKED AT SOME -- THINGS THAT WE WE ARE THE VOTERS HAVE PUT INTO STATUTE -- AND WE HAVE MODIFIED THOSE MEAN DRUG CRIMES ARE OBVIOUSLY THE MOST AND MOST PUBLIC ARE KNOWN EXAMPLE OF THAT -- BUT WE HAVE BOTH. RE RE DEFINED CRIMES RECONFIGURED THEM AS WELL AS ADDED CRIMES TO THE BOOKS. AND I THINK THAT THAT IS CLEARLY THE PRIVATE OF OF BOTH THE VOTERS AND OF THE LEGISLATURE. SO I THINK IT'S VERY APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THOSE -- CHANGES TO BE RESPECTED AND I THINK THIS IS NEEDED AND APPRECIATED -- DO WE HAVE A MOTION. WE CAN HOLD AN WE CAN HAVE A YOU PERCENT ON THE NEXT BILL AND THEN WE CAN GET A MOTION BUT YOU CAN CLOSE ON THIS -- ONE THIS PRESERVES THE THE WILL OF THE VOTERS -- WHETHER TO LEGISLATOR WHO PUT US HERE OR WAS ABOUT IS THEMSELVES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. SO WILL HOLD TO GET A MOTION BUT WILL ALLOW YOU 2% ON YOUR NEXT BILL. THANK YOU. WITH YOUR CO AUTHOR. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO SHARE PRESENTATION OF AB SIXTY EIGHTY EIGHT WITH THE BILL'S JOINT AUTHORS AND THE NUMBER JONES SAWYER -- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL TODAY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING WE WILL WORK ON AMENDMENTS THIS WEEK AND TAKE THE BILL UP. FOR A VOTE NEXT HEARING NEXT WEEK. LAST YEAR WE PARTNERED. ED TO REQUEST A THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE TO APPROVE AN AUDIT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CC ARE IN PRISON REPEAL A DATE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. THE RESULTING AUDIT FINDINGS WERE CONCERNING THE ARTISTS FOUND THAT IN MAY TWO COMPLETED THEIR RECOMMENDED REHABILITATION PROGRAMS RECIDIVIST AT THE AT ABOUT THE SAME RATE AS IN MAY TWO WERE NOT ASSIGNED TO THOSE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. PERHAPS THE MOST ALARMING ON THE AUDIT FINDINGS WAS THAT THE CDC ARE FAILED TO MEET ANY OF THE REHABILITATIVE NEEDS 462% OF THE INMATES RELEASED. LAST YEAR WHO HAD BEEN ASSESSED AS A RISK OF RECIDIVISM AS A RESULT WE INTRODUCED AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH ENDEAVORS TO PURSUE THE ODDEST RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THANK YOU AND IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT CDC OURS REHABILITATION PROGRAMS REDUCE RECIDIVISM AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WERE CARS YOU SEE ARE. TWO ONE REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE NCDC ARW COMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS TO ESTABLISH PERFORMANCE TARGETS INCLUDING ONES FOR REDUCING RECIDIVISM AN ATTORNEY TO PROGRAMS COST EFFECTIVENESS. THREE PARTNER WITH EXTERNAL RESEARCHERS TO EVALUATE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AND IMPLEMENT MEANT A COMPREHENSIVE THREE YEAR PLAN TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST ISSUE AN ANNUAL REPORT BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWO THAT SHOWS A PERCENTAGE OF REDUCTION OF RECIDIVISM THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WE HOPE THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT PUBLIC FUNDS ARE PROPERLY UTILIZED. AND THE STATE IS FULLY FOR FILLING THE REHABILITATIVE COMPONENT OF THE CORRECTIONAL EXPERIENCE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. NEXT WEEK. THANK YOU LET SEE IF THERE'S SOME WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IRVING ALVAREZ CAME OUT THE PRISON SYSTEM AND I'M TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD I STILL HAVE NOT GOT MY SCHOOL DIPLOMA. THERE IS NO OLD REHABILITATION AND THE CDC PRISONS SO PLEASE MAKE THIS PAST THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. ANY IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] ART -- OF WE WE MAY GET A MOTION WHERE WE WERE WE'RE GOING TO WAIT BUT LET ME SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL I'M VERY GLAD YOU BROUGHT IT FORWARD. I THINK I IS ALL OF US WERE ALARMED BY MANY OF THE FINDINGS THAT THE AUDITOR FOUND. THAT THE THERE WERE -- THE ASSIGNMENT OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS TO THE INMATES DID NOT MATCH THE INMATES NEED THAT WAS ONE OF THE FINDINGS THAT CAME OUT. THE THERE WERE WAITING LISTS THERE WERE FACILITIES THAT DID NOT HAVE -- THERE WERE AND WE HAD PRISONS THAT DID NOT HAVE APPROPRIATE FACILITIES TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. THAT WE HAVE A REALLY -- INVESTED IN NOT ONLY DO TO PROP FIFTY SEVEN BUT ONCE WE GOT OUT OF THE RECESSION WE BEGAN TO BE. VERY CLEAR THAT WE NEEDED TO PUT REHABILITATION BACK INTO OUR PRISON SYSTEM. AND SO WE OBVIOUSLY. INSTANCES AT OUR INTENT AND WE KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT SERVE TIME IN OUR PRISON SYSTEM WILL RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. FOR PUBLIC SAFETY ALONE WE WANT THAT RETURN TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE AND IT IS THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THAT WOULD ALLOW US -- TO SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE BRINGING FORWARD AND I ALSO GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO LET US -- JUST IN AGREE THIS SECTION THE CHAPTER EIGHT POINT THREE WITH THE SECTION ONE BECAUSE I NOTED IN THE BILL. US FOR REPORT WHICH WE I THINK WE NEEDED WE ONE HAVE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY BUT YOU ALSO ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO YOU WE REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS TO DO SOME THINGS AND I THINK WE MIGHT WANT TO INTEGRATE THEM. SO AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE REQUIRING THEM WE'RE ALSO HAVING THEM REPORT TO US ON WHAT WE REQUIRE SO THE IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE AND I HOPE I THINK WE WILL GET TO A GOOD PLACE. AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS SO -- LET'S SEE WHAT WE DON'T NEED THE MOTION BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA DO VOTE ONLY NEXT WEEK. AND THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY CLOSING STATEMENT THAT'S PERFECTLY LEGIT. YEAH NO I APPRECIATE YOU AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US ON THIS BILL HAPPY TO DO THAT. A MAN AND AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO SEE MORE MONEY GOING TO MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE. IN THE SYSTEM ARE GETTING THE REHABILITATIVE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. WE'VE NEVER HAD AN AUDIT. TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY THIS IS WHAT IT WAS DETERMINED AND SO WE ARE REALLY HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE. BECAUSE OUR GOAL I THINK IS A STATE SHOULD BE TO MOVE TOWARDS REHABILITATING FOLKS THAT ARE IN PRISON BUT THEN ALSO MAKING SURE WE SPENT MORE MONEY TOWARDS PREVENTATIVE PROGRAMS OR PREVENTATIVE ALTERNATIVES LIKE. PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO SCHOOLS THAT ARE IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF THEM FEEL LIKE THEY NEED. TO COMMIT THE THINGS OR DO THE THINGS UP LET THEM TO PRISON THE FIRST PLACE -- BUT THIS IS A GREAT FIRST STEP AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BUT ONCE THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE. AND I AND I BELIEVE ONCE. WE GET THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT HOW WELL THESE FOUR PROGRAMS WORK THOSE WHO ARE NOT. REALLY BEHIND REHABILITATION WILL SEE THE BENEFITS OF IT ALSO MOST IMPORTANT RETURN ON INVESTMENT THAT IS MUCH AS AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID IT'S MUCH BETTER TO REHABILITATE SOMEONE STATUS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEN TO CONTINUE TO LOCK PEOPLE UP. THANK YOU BOTH. ALL RIGHT SIR WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ITEM. EIGHT AB EIGHT OH THREE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB EIGHT OH THREE WHICH SEEKS TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH. AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA'S CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS -- AS THEY TAKE ON A STRESSFUL THE STRESS OF LIFE IN STATE PRISON FACILITIES CALIFORNIA'S CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS EXPERIENCE A VARIETY OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL TRAUMA -- AS A RESULT OF THEIR CAREER ACCORDING TO THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS SURVEYED REPORTED FEELING DEPRESSED AND SUICIDE. CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ALSO FACED A HIGH INCIDENCE OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AS WELL AS DIABETES MORE THAN THE AVERAGE AMERICAN. BECAUSE OF THIS -- WELLNESS PROGRAMS ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT HEALTH AND SAFETY IS INTIMATE I'M CURRENTLY THIS CD SEE OUR PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR OFFICERS BUT THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT INPUTS FROM OFFICERS. BE SOLICITED AND TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION -- THIS GAP EXISTS IN EXISTING LAW AND HAS LED TO A PATCH WORK OF POLICIES RESULTING IN MANY OFFICERS -- BEING RELUCTANT TO SUPPORT THESE KINDS OF SERVICES AB -- EIGHT OH THREE WHAT X. STATUS WITHIN CDC ARE A PEER SUPPORT LABOR -- MANAGEMENT -- COMMITTEE TASK FORCE WITH CREATING -- IT UPDATED STANDARDIZES STATEWIDE POLICY UP WITH DEPARTMENT OF PEER SUPPORT PROGRAM WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES ARE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION BENEFITS TRUST FUND AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION ALL WILL SELF INTRODUCE. THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING CHEN MEMBERS NAMELY PETRON WITH MAKE YOU CAPTAIN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION BENEFIT TRUST FUND WE'RE HERE TODAY AS CO SPONSORS OF THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. I HAVE WITH ME DÃ¢N BIÃ£U MAN WHO IS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION BENEFIT TRUST FUND AS WELL AS THE CHAPTER PRESIDENT AT KERN VALLEY STATE PRISON AND HE WILL BRIEFLY SPEAK -- ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THE NEED FOR A BE ABLE. THREE CURRENTLY RESEARCH SUPPORTS AT ONE OF FOR CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS SUFFER FROM POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. THIS IS HIGHER THAN THAT OF COMBAT VETERANS. I MYSELF IN THE UNITED STATES MARINE COMBAT VETERAN. WHEN I SAW WHILE DEPLOYED TO IRAQ IS NOTHING TO A WE GET EXPOSED TO ON A DAILY BASIS? AND THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. THE KEY TO MAKING POSITIVE CHANGES IN THE STATISTICS IS A WELL ESTABLISHED AND STANDARDIZED SUPPORT PROGRAM. THIS BILL WILL DO THAT. IT WILL ESTABLISH A PEER SUPPORT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE. THAT WILL BE TASKED WITH CRAFTING. AND UPDATING A STANDARDIZED STATEWIDE POLICY FOR THE APARTMENTS SUPPORT PROGRAM. FROM FIGHTS THE THREE HUNDRED MEN RIGHTS FROM SUICIDE TO MURDERS. TO US COMING ACROSS DISMEMBERED BODIES. THE HUMAN MIND IS NOT DESIGNED TO SEE THESE LEVELS OF VIOLENCE. YET OUR CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE SUBJECTED TO THIS ON A DAILY BASIS. AND THEN SENT BACK. TO CARRY ON NORMAL LIVES. ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS DON'T SEEK HELP THAT THEY NEED. IS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT WE TALKED TO ONE UNDERSTAND WHAT WE GO THROUGH BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER BEEN IN OUR SHOES. SUPPORT USES CORRECTIONAL STAFF AS COUNSELORS. THERE BY DEVELOPING A NEXUS BETWEEN THE COUNSELOR AND THOSE OF US THAT ARE IN NEED OF THE HELP. HOWEVER THIS PROGRAM ALSO NEEDS TO BE TRUSTED. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TALK AND IN SOME CASES EVEN BE REFERRED WITHOUT THE FEAR OF STIGMA OR RETRIBUTION. THE CURRENT DIRECTION THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S PEER SUPPORT PROGRAM IS HEADED WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO IT SELF DESTRUCTION. WELL ALL OF US AND OUR FAMILIES ARE LEFT TO SUFFER IN SILENCE. I'VE HAD TO BURY NUMEROUS OFFICERS DUE TO SUICIDE BECAUSE OF THE STRESSES. THAT ARE IMPOSED UPON US. THESE ARE OUR PARTNERS IN OUR FAMILY. THESE ARE YOUR COACHES YOUR VOLUNTEERS AND PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. WE WILL NO LONGER STAND BY AND LISTEN TO THE SCREAMS OF CHILDREN AND SPOUSES AND THEY BURY THEIR LOVED ONES BECAUSE THERE WASN'T THE RIGHT KIND OF HELP. FOR THIS WE ARE PROUD OF THOSE THAT WILL STAND WITH US TO STOP THIS CRISIS. AND THE CCPOA BENEFIT TRUST FUND IS A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB EIGHT OH THREE THANK YOU. HAVE WE HEARD FROM ALL THE WITNESSES. NO SIR. THEN PLEASE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS STEFAN WALKER I'M THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS FOR CCPOA. I AM ALSO YOUTH CORRECTIONAL OFFICER -- THE PURPOSE FOR EIGHT OH THREE IS THAT WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IS A LEGACY. OF A TOUGH ON CRIME -- MENTALITY. HEY IN DID WE HARDENED OUR FACILITIES WE HARDEN THE OPERATIONS -- AND AN ENHANCED PUBLIC SAFETY. HOWEVER WHAT WE FOR GOD IN THE PUBLIC PART. ARE THE PEOPLE. AND THE PEOPLE CHANGE PEOPLE. ARE GOING TO EVOLVE THEY'RE GOING TO NEED MORE ASSISTANCE AND WHAT ARE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS SHOULD RECOGNIZE IS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE RESPONSIVE. TO THAT FACT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE UNDERNEATH THE SYSTEMS. THE AXIOM OF THIS IS THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT. IS PART OF THE PROBLEM OF WHY WE'RE DEALING WITH A BROKEN SYSTEM. AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT CDC ARE OPERATES WITHIN A BOX. AND THEY KNOW THIS. THE KEEPING ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO AS YOU HEARD EARLIER TODAY. THE KEEPING THE THINGS THAT THEY DO TO THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY EXTERNAL INCLUDE OR INSIGHT AS TO HOW IT OPERATES AND THE EFFECT THAT IT HAS ON THE PEOPLE. THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SERVING. WELL HERE WE'RE HERE TO TELL YOU THAT IT'S NOT SERVING US. IT'S A PEER SUPPORT PROGRAM. BUT WE HAVE NO SAY SO IN WHO THOSE PEERS ARE. IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR IN THE ONE OF THE BASE TENANTS THAT THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON YOU WILL NOT REVIEW WILL NOT IMPOSE UPON US SOMETHING WE HAVE NO SAY SO IN. WE ARE ASKING TODAY [inaudible] FOR HELP. WE'RE ASKING FOR A RE EVALUATION OF THE SYSTEM THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY FAILING THE PEOPLE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SERVING. OUR MEMBERS ARE DYING. AND THEY'RE TINKERING AROUND THE AGES. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE A WHOLESALE CHANGE OF THE IN WAIT THIS SYSTEM OPERATES. IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR FOR TO ASK MEN AND WOMEN TO BE HELD AT A HIGHER STANDARD. TO BE HELD AT A HIGHER STANDARD. TO BE. TO GET A HIGHER PAY. GET A HIGHER RETIREMENT. IN THE RECOGNITION THAT THE JOB THAT YOU'RE DOING. IS MORE DANGEROUS. BUT THEN YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE WHOLE PERSON. THAT'S IT'S NOT FAIR WE'RE WE'RE LITERALLY TREATING PEOPLE AS IF THEY'RE COGS IN THE MACHINE. AND WE'RE DISPOSABLE. WE WILL NOT. WE CANNOT AS THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE STANDING ON THE LINE THAT IS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE. OF THE FORTIFICATION THAT HAS OCCURRED. AND JUST KEEP TOSSING US LIKE WE'RE KINDLING ON THE ON THE ON THE FIRE. IT'S NOT FAIR. AND WE'RE ASKING WE HUMBLY ASK. FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. X. KOBE PRESIDED WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS WE WORK ALONGSIDE OUR BROTHER AND SISTER CO -- OFFICERS ON THE DAILY BASIS THEY'RE THE ONES TO KEEP US SAFE. YET WE SEE TIME AND TIME AGAIN THE TRAGEDIES FROM THE TRAUMA THEY INDOOR -- SO WE ARE HOPEFUL ORDERLY IN SUPPORT THIS BILL. HELEN ROTH DOWDEN SEIU LOCAL -- ONE THOUSAND WERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS FOR A SEAT OUR OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO WORK WITH US IN THOSE FACILITIES. AND WE'RE WORKING ON AMENDMENTS WITH -- THE SPONSOR I'M ON TO TAKE SOME CARE SOME ISSUES THANK YOU. IT LITTLE WITH CALIFORNIA'S FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THREE NINE ANY QUESTIONS. SENATOR BRAD BIRD. ON BELIEVES MUCH OF THE QUESTION IS A STATEMENT AND I WOULD. I HEARD TO PASSION IN MISTER WALKER'S TESTIMONY AS TO NOT TREATING THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE EVERY DAY -- TO TO THIS JOB AND I THINK IT'S A TWO PRONGED BENEFIT IF YOU TREAT THE MEN AND WOMEN BETTER I WOULD HOPE THAT WOULD BE BETTER. INTERACTION WITH THOSE AND MADE HIS WELL SO THEY TOO WILL SEE A MORE HUMANE ENVIRONMENT IF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE CHARGED WITH LOOKING OVERSEE AND LOOKING AFTER THEM. WERE TREATED IN A MORE RESPECTFUL MANNER SO DO YOU FEEL THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE BENEFITS AS WELL THROUGH THROUGH THIS MEASURE ABSOLUTELY. I BELIEVE THE IF WE WERE TO BRING ANY OF THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES -- CLINICIANS PRACTITIONERS IN DAY WILL TELL YOU THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE IN DURING TRAUMA. HAVE A DIFFICULTY EMPATHIZING WITH ANYONE ELSE IT'S AN DURING TRAUMA. AND THIS SYSTEM FUNDAMENTALLY IMPACTS EVERYONE ENGAGED IN IT. AND WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF REALIZING THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE. UNDER INVOLVED IN UNDERNEATH THE SYSTEM SO YES. THE SERMON GIPSON I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY THIS IS DONE LEGISLATIVELY AND NOT AS A MEET AND CONFER OPPORTUNITY. WELL. LET ME ASK. MISTER WALKER TO RESPOND TO THAT NOW COMMENTS I DON'T KNOW I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU THE DESTRUCTIVE -- I'LL TELL YOU IN IN ALL CANDOR. THIS IS SOMETHING THE THE ASSOCIATION HAS FAILED AT FOUR USE WE'VE THOUGHT. WOULD LIKE THE SYSTEM DOES DID REPRESENTATION WAS ABOUT MONEY. WAS ABOUT SAFETY EQUIPMENT WAS ABOUT RETIREMENT. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD AN OFFICER KILLED HIMSELF ABOUT. SEVEN YEARS AGO WE'VE HAD. MANY SINCE THEN. BUT THAT WAS IF YOU WILL AN AWAKENING. TO THE REALITY DID ALL OF THAT STUFF DOES NOTHING FOR THE PERSON OFF AND IT'S UP ZERO COMFORT TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS. THE OTHER SURVIVING THAT INDIVIDUAL -- SO WE BEGAN AN EFFORT OF ENGAGING. IN OUTSIDE THE NORMAL NEGOTIATING PROCESS -- WITH THE ADMINISTRATION DURING GOVERNOR BROWN'S ADMINISTRATION AND WE WERE TOLD THAT THIS WOULD NOT. WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE NORMAL NEGOTIATING PROCESS THAT WE WOULD CARE DID EVERYBODY RECOGNIZED IT ALL WHILE DO PEOPLE. THAT ARE SUFFERING -- SAID WE THEY'VE PROVEN THAT NOT TO BE TRUE THERE DISINGENUOUS IN THEIR IN THEIR WHOLE EFFORT. OF CARING FOR PEOPLE SO AT SOME POINT PROBABLY THIS NECKS CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS YOU WILL SEE [inaudible] SOME -- HOPEFULLY SOME SOME AMENDED -- CHAIR ARTICLES INCORPORATED INTO OUR AMMO YOU BUT FOR RIGHT NOW. THEY WON'T DO IT. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE WITH HERE TO YOU WE'VE WE'VE S.. TO BE PART OF THIS SYSTEM. AND THEY JUST FLAT OUT NO. SO THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO GET IT IS EITHER. THROUGH YOU OR THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS ON UNFORTUNATELY NEGOTIATIONS IS A MEET AND CONFER. PROCESS SO IF THEY'RE TELLING US NO ON SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A HEALTH RELATED EFFORT. THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA TELL US NO WITH THE TABLE AS WELL. SO WE HAVE TO COME TO YOU. WHO ARE MEMBERS ARE YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND WE'RE? THE BILL LITERALLY AT YOUR MERCY TO TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE HURTING. AND DISS. YOU KNOW THIS IS A PIECEMEAL EFFORT -- I WOULD SAY IT'S A VERY DEMANDING MISS CHANGES TO THEIR POWER AND CONTROL. TO SIMPLY SAY NO YOU HAVE TO TALK TO YOUR EMPLOYEES. SO -- MISTER WALKER. TO REPEAT ON RIGHT AT IT. HE SAID WE HAVE NOT PUT IT IN THEM -- YOU REQUEST AT THE BARGAINING TABLE. OUT BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY BEEN KIND OF HINTED OR TOLD THAT IT. IT WOULD BE A NON NEGOTIABLE ITEM. SO SO WE HAVEN'T PUSHED THE MEET AND CONFER OPPORTUNITY YET BUT YOU PLAN TO DO IT AT THE NEXT. BARGAINING ROUND. WHICH WHATEVER YOU WE JUST WE JUST APPROVED THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVE ONE FOR ONE YEAR RIGHT RIGHT SO SO. SO YOU DIDN'T DO IT. FOR THE CURRENT CONTRACT BUT YOU PLAN TO DO IT FOR THE NEXT CONTRACT WELL -- CONSIDERABLY MORE HOLISTIC EFFORT YES BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS DID THEY HAVE TO AGREE TO DO IT AND THUS FAR. THEY'VE BEEN UNWILLING TO MATE ANY WHOLESALE CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM AS I SAID THEY WANT TO TINKER AROUND THE AGES AND AND PUT A NEW VENEER OF OF PAINT. ON IT TOO ON THE OTHER ONE I I DO WANT TO GET INTO TO THE EMOTION YES. YES I'M JUST LOOKING AT IT ADMINISTRATIVELY WE KNOW WHAT'S THE PROCESS AND HOW SHOULD I RESPECT THE PROCESS THE PROCESS IS THE DAY DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM DO IT BUT YOU'VE YOU'VE TOLD ME THAT YOU HAVEN'T. BROUGHT IT INTO THE BARGAINING. BECAUSE WHEN I SOLD WE WOULD NEED TO DO IT AT THE BARGAINING TABLE DID WE JUST DO IT IN THIS UNOFFICIAL CAPACITY. BUT WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS TAKEN OUR IDEAS AND I'M I'M TALKING ABOUT. YEARS OF WORK AND DAVE. BASICALLY SKIM THE TOP OF IT OFF. AS AN ATTEMPT FOR ANYONE THAT LOOKS AT IT NOW. YOU'LL SEE AT THE VERY SERVICE OF IT DID IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING BUT ON THE GROUND. THERE'S NO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE. SO I'M TELLING YOU DE IN SHORT. THEY'LL TELL YOU THEY'LL COME BACK AND TELL YOU ALL YOU DON'T NEED THIS BILL YU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE. BUT AND JUST THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE. DALY DECIDED ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT ANY INPUT FROM US TO GO OUT AND BUY MASSAGE TEARS. AND PUT THEM IN THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO GO THERE. SIDE YOU KNOW THE BIG DAY -- I'M I'M AGAIN JUST TRYING. TO TO DETERMINE THE PROCESS TO BE FAIR TO THE TO THAT YES. SO SO WITH THAT I I AM I HAVE A LITTLE DIFFICULTY WITH YOUR BILL SOON. GIPSON SIDE JUST WANTED TO SHARE THE THAT THAT THERE'S A A PROCESS OF NEGOTIATIONS AND I I WONDER IF IT THAT'S BEING SHORT CUT IT SO MAYBE IN YOUR CLOSING STATEMENT YOU CAN. TELL ME I'M NOT GETTING THIS BILL RIGHT. I PREFER THE QUESTION SENATOR -- LET ME JUST WILL BY WALK YOU THROUGH -- THROUGH ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I HAD OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH FAMILY MEMBERS I'M AT THE BILTMORE HOTEL IN LOS ANGELES. I WAS A GATHERING OF CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AT THAT GATHERING I HEARD FROM -- WIVES AND CHILDREN WHO LOST THEIR LOVED ONES DUE TO SUICIDE -- IF YOU EVER. ACTUALLY VISIT A STATE PRISON BEFORE -- WHERE YOU SEE -- THE HARD CORE INDIVIDUALS AS THERE AND TAKING HOME I'VE HEARD FROM A MOTHER. pCOMMITTED SUICIDE AS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER TAKING THAT HOME WITHDRAWING THEMSELVES FROM THE FAMILY ROUTINE. ISOLATING HIMSELF -- AND THOSE SITUATIONS -- WAS NOT NOTICEABLE -- TO THE POINT WHERE -- HELP COULD BE RENDERED IMMEDIATELY THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES -- TAKE THAT WORK AND THAT STRESS LEVEL HOME EACH AND EVERY DAY AND TO THINK. AS THE ASSOCIATION HAS WORKED WITH A MANAGEMENT TO TRY -- TO GET -- YOU KNOW A COMPREHENSIVE PEER SYSTEMS REVIEW KIND OF PROGRAM IN PLACE TO THINK THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY FACILITATE THAT THAT'S THE REASON WHY THIS BILLS BEFORE YOU BECAUSE THERE'S NO BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL IN FACT DO JUST THAT KIND OF THING. THERE'S NO BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL STAND BY THE WORD SO THAT'S THE REASON WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO SIMPLY SAY. ON THAT WE NEED A PEER -- SUPPORT GROUP SO THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH IN THE CORRECTION FACILITY CAN HAVE A PEER -- TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT THEY FACE EACH AND EVERY DAY -- AND SO TOO AGAIN LOOK AT THOSE WHO HAVE WHO HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE AND WHAT -- THE OFFICERS HAVE TO GO THROUGH ON A DAILY BASIS -- I INDICATED ABOUT THE HYPERTENSION -- I INDICATED ABOUT THE DIABETES MORE THAN ANY AVERAGE AMERICAN FACE WITH AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT GOES ALONG WITH THE JOB AND SO THIS BILL IS NECESSARY CERTAINLY THEY COULD TRY TO GET AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE BUT ALSO THEY CAN. REQUEST THAT WE DO NOT GO TO BAR pHE DOES THAT HELP -- OFFICERS WHO ARE AGAIN DEALING WITH THE STRESS OF THE WORK AND THE TENSION AND THE DEPRESSION AND THE SUICIDAL TENDENCIES GO ALONG WITH THE WORK THAT DOESN'T HELP THEM AT ALL AND SO THIS BILL IS VERY ECESSARY I THINK IT'S VERY TIMELY. AND I THINK CCPOA FOR ALLOW ME TO BE THE THE CONDUIT TO BRING BEFORE YOU TODAY AND I'VE SIMPLY ASKED WHEN I VOTE. THANK YOU PASTOR GIPSON OF THANK THE MOTION OR IS THERE A MOTION READY ON THIS.

A PERSON WHO IS BETWEENTHE AGES OF TWELVE AND SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE AS A WARD OF THE CURT BASED ON TRUANCY. INSTEAD OF PEACE OFFICERS AND NEEDING TO REFER ANY MINOR UNDER THE JURISDICTION -- TO A COMMUNITY BASED DIVERSION PROGRAM -- UNAVAILABLE MY BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT TO CONTRACT. TOOK TO CONTRACT OR OFFER SERVICES THAT READ THAT PROVIDES -- UP LOCATION JOB SKILL TRAINING COUNSELING MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCE EDUCATIONAL OP SUPPORT ART RECREATION AND OTHER YOUTH -- DEVELOPMENT SERVICES THAT THESE YOUTH NEED WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS PROBATION DEPARTMENT WILL NOT BE AUTHORIZED TO MAINTAIN A FORMAL OR INFORMAL CASELOAD OR CREATING A MANDATE MANDATE A PROBATION A CONDITION. FOR MINOR NOT ON PROBATION BUT THESE PROGRAMS WILL STILL BE ALLOWED THAT UP WITH THAT PARTICIPANTS OF THE YOUTH WHO ARE CURRENTLY ON PROBATION WHO MAY ALSO BENEFIT FROM THESE -- IN ORDER TO STRAY AWAY FROM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE -- SYSTEM. WELL I WOULD I DO NOT ARGUE THAT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM MUST HAVE I A BACKDROP UP WITH THOSE WHO ARE AND WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES. WE MUST ALSO CREATE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN -- THOSE WHO HAVE BROKEN THE LAW AND COMMIT A CRIME VERSES THOSE WHO HAVE NOT THOSE WHO -- HOOPS THEY DON'T VOLUNTEER PROBATION JUST BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN SHORT JUST BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE DISOBEYED A TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM JUST BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN LATE TO CLASS -- WE MUST CREATE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE LET ME ALSO SAY CALIFORNIA JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS BEEN -- DRAMATICALLY I'M TRANSFORM OVER THE LAST. FIFTEEN YEARS TO ITS CREDIT LOS ANGELES COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN PART OF THESE POSITIVE CHANGES WORKING WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FOR TO TO HELP REDUCE -- POLICIES -- REFERRALS TO JUVENILE HALL DIVERSION PROGRAMS -- FROM COURTS AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS CAMPS -- WE MUST KEP IN MIND THAT WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP INDIVIDUALS EARLY SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT GET CAUGHT UP IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. EARLY AGE AND THE COMMON WAY OF GETTING INDIVIDUALS CAUGHT UP IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS IN FACT -- BY CITING THEM FOR TRUANCY WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES ARE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE YOUTH JUSTICE COALITION. AND ALSO THE ACLU WHO WAS SELF INTRODUCE. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME IS ARE YOU MORE AND THOMAS I'M A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT AND A MEMBER OF THE YOUTH JUSTICE COALITION. WE ARE HONORED TO BE A CO SPONSOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL NINE A pPROBATION DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE TO PUT. USE WHO HAVE NOT BEENTO COURT. UNDER PROBATION SUPERVISION INCLUDING REPORTING TO A PROBATION OFFICER. BEING PART OF PROBATION CASE LOAD OR HAVING SO FOLLOW CONDITIONS. N. IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS A VOLUNTARY PROBATION. BUT IN OUR EXPERIENCES IT IS NOT VOLUNTARY. IN LA COUNTY WE ORGANIZE IN THIS PRACTICE IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THOUSANDS OF YOUTH IN LA COUNTY ALONG REPORTING TO A PROBATION OFFICER. ATTENDANCE OR LOW GRADES FEDERAL SPENDING MONEY ON TUTORING OR COUNSELING. USER FORTY TWO A PROBATION OFFICER IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. YOU'D ON VOLUNTARY PROVISION HAVE THE SEARCH REGULARLY AND REQUIRED TO DRUGS IS. I WANT TO VENICE HIGH SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES I'VE NEVER BEEN ARRESTED AND I WASN'T ON PROBATION. BUT THE SCHOOL PROBATION OFFICER USED TO STOP ME ON A DAILY BASIS. HE WORE SU IN DARK SUNGLASSES AND WALKED AROUND WITH THE CLIPBOARD. HE ONLY CALLED ME BY MY LAST NAME. HE WAS SAY. MARTIN YOUR ON PROBATION YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO COME SEE ME. I WAS SAY NO I'M NOT ON PROBATION. BUT HE WOULD SAY YOUR ON MY ROSTER. IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE A BAD KEY. AND I THINK IT MAY OTHER PEOPLE IN MY SCHOOL ALSO SEE ME THOUGH IT. I STILL DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT ON THE LOOSE WITH THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT. I DID ME SUPPORT. MY MOM WAS RAISING ME AND MY LITTLE BROTHER BARS SELF. AND SHE GOT VERY SICK A PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ME TO DO MORE HOME IS STILL CONCENTRATE ON SCHOOL. I STARTED GETTING ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED MORE. BUT THE SCHOOL PROBATION OFFICER NEVER OFFERED ME ANY COUNSELING OR HELP WITH SCHOOL WORK. WHEN I GOT INTO A FIGHT AT SCHOOL? AGAIN NO ONE EVER ASKS ME WHERE MAYBE SO ANGRY OR SAT ME DOWN WITH THE OTHER STUDENTS TO WORK THINGS OUT. I WAS EXPELLED AND I WASN'T REFERRED TO ANOTHER SCHOOL. WHICH I FOUND OUT LATER IS AGAINST THE LAW. I WAS OUT OF SCHOOL FOR MONTHS. I WILL LEAVE EVERY DAY FROM HOME JUST TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE I WAS IN SCHOOL. BUT I WAS REALLY IN THE STREETS ARE THEY WOMAN WANTS AND ALWAYS KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL. EVENTUALLY I WROTE IN ANOTHER SCHOOL BUT THERE WHEN A TEACHER MOTORISTS COMMON IN CLASS. I LOST MY TEMPER INTO A CHAIR. I WAS ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO JUVENILE. PROBATION TELL ME THIS IS WHERE I WOULD BE FOR A LONG TIME. I WAS TOLD I WOULDN'T BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS. IT WAS A VERY HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE. I WAS PUT ON PROBATION FOR THREE YEARS DURING THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS ON PROBATION I NEVER HAS SUPPORT. RE ENROLLING IN SCHOOL. I WAS TOLD TO DO ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASSES FOR HIGH RISK HIGH NEEDS YOUTH. BUT MY MOTHER COULDN'T AFFORD THE FEES. SO BASICALLY ALL I GOT DURING THOSE THREE YEARS WHOSE DRUG TESTS HE SHOULD USE WHO HAVE COMMITTED NO CRIME BE LIKE A CRIMINAL IN THE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES. IF I HAD GOTTEN COUNSELING OR CHILDREN INSTEAD OF SO CALLED VOLUNTARY PROBATION SUPERVISION MAYBE I WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL OR REST THE MAYBE I WOULD HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD. MAYBE I WILL BE IN COLLEGE. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF YOU THAT MY SAME STORY AND OUR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES WHEN YOU CENTERS AND JOBS FOR YOU. WE NEED COLLEGE PREPARATION INSTEAD. WE WHEN WE ARE PUT ON PROBATION SEARCHED AND QUESTIONED WE ARE GETTING PRISON PREPARATION. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB NINE OWN. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE PROUD TO BE A CO SPONSOR OF AB. NINE OH ONE THE ISSUES AB NINE A ONE ADDRESSES CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE ACLU IT'S THE RESULT OF OUR WORK IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT IN RIVERSIDE PLACED OVER THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN ON PROBATION CONTRACTS FOR NORMAL YOUTHFUL BEHAVIOR. BASED ON THE BROAD AUTHORITY GRANTED UNDER WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION. SIX FIFTY FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO PROBATION FOR VIOLATIONS OF WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION SIX OH ONE WHICH MAKES IT AN OFFENSE FOR JUVENILE TO BE A TRUE AND OR TO PERSISTENTLY OR HABITUALLY REFUSE TO OBEY THE REASONABLE AND PROPER ORDERS OF SCHOOL SORTIES. REASONS GIVEN FOR PLACING USE ON PROBATION IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY HAVE INCLUDED PRE DELINQUENT SCHOOL MISBEHAVIOR. INCORRIGIBLE EDDIE DEFIANCE AND EVEN POOR GRADES. IN ONE CASE A STUDENT WAS PLACED ON SECTION SIX FIFTY FOUR PROBATION FOR BEHAVIOR RELATED TO PRE FROM THE DEATH OF A BABY SISTER. ENFORCEMENT FALLS PROPORTION DID DISPROPORTIONATELY ON STUDENTS OF COLOR. ONCE REFERRED TO USE AND THEIR PARENTS ARE OFTEN TOLD THAT IF THEY DON'T AGREE TO PROBATION THEIR CASES COULD BE REFERRED TO THE DA ALTHOUGH IN MOST OF THESE CASES THERE IS NO OFFENSE FOR WHICH A PETITION. WOULD BE FILED. UNDER SECTION SIX FIFTY FOUR INFORMAL PROBATION PROGRAMS CAN OPERATE WITH NONE OF THE SAFEGUARDS OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS SUCH AS ACCESS TO APPOINTED COUNSEL OR ADEQUATE KNOWS NOTICE OF CHARGES OR THE UNDERLYING FACTS OR ANY KIND OF IMPARTIAL DECISION MAKER. YET YOUNG PEOPLE AND UP ON PROBATION CONDITIONS THAT ARE OFTEN MORE PUNITIVE THAN A JUDGE WOULD ASSIGN AS AS WE'VE JUST HEARD THIS IS NOT WHAT THE YOUTH NEED TO ADDRESS THE KINDS OF PROBLEMS. FOR WHICH THEY ARE BEING PUT ON THESE PROGRAMS. YOUTH AGREE -- TO TERMS INCLUDING BROAD SEARCHES OF THEIR PERSONS AND HOMES AS WELL AS RANDOM DRUG TESTING WE KNOW THAT THIS KIND OF SURVEILLANCE BASED PROGRAM DOES NOT WORK WITH YOUTH TO PREVENT FUTURE MISBEHAVIOR. STUDENTS ACCUSED OF SCHOOL MISBEHAVIOR OR LOW LEVEL OFFENSES SHOULD BE REFERRED TO APPROPRIATE SERVES SERVICE PROVIDERS NOT TO PROBATION. EIGHTY NINE A ONE WILL LIMIT THE USE OF VOLUNTARY PROBATION TO THOSE CASES WHERE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO ENSURE MORE EFFECTIVE IN SUPPORT OF OUTCOMES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. WE ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. THE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ROLEX SORRY BUT NO PROBLEM. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS LAURIE DOLPHY ON THE DIRECTOR OF POLICY WITH THE DEATH WOULD BURNS INSTITUTE WE ARE A NATIONAL NONPROFIT BASED IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA WORKING TO REDUCE RACIAL NOTHING DISPARITIES IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE'RE HONORED TO CO SPONSOR EIGHTY NINE A ONE AND ARE HERE TODAY TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT. EIGHTY NINE A ONE MAKES IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS TO THE WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE THAT PROTECTS CHILDREN WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ACCUSED OF CRIMES FROM THE HARMS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THESE PROTECTIONS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE HARMS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM FALL DESPERATELY ON YOUTH OF COLOR. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BLACK YOUTH WERE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE REFERRED TO PROBATION LATINO YOUTH ONE AND A HALF TIMES MORE LIKELY AND NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH TWICE AS LIKELY. IMPORTANTLY THIS JUSTICE SYSTEM CONTACT WITHOUT ANY OVERSIGHT FROM THE COURT IS NOT BENIGN. RESEARCH TELLS US THAT SUPERVISION OF YOU TO OUR LOW RISK DOES MORE HARM THAN GOOD BOTH FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND FOR THE YOUTH AND ACTUALLY INCREASES THE CHANCE THAT YOU WILL BECOME MORE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL. SORRY IS STORY CERTAINLY ILLUSTRATES THIS WELL AND SERIOUS STORY IS NOT UNIQUE THOUSANDS OF YOUTH IN LA IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY ALONE WERE SUBJECT TO THESE HARMS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. FERNANDO GIRALDO THE CHIEF OF PROBATION FROM SANTA CRUZ COUNTY WITH MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS A PROBATION OFFICER HOPE TO BE HERE TODAY TO SHARE HIS SUPPORT BUT HE WAS UNABLE. TO HE DID SUBMIT A LETTER OF SUPPORT AND IN THAT LETTER HE SAYS. EVEN WHEN PROBATION OFFICERS HAVE THE BEST OF INTENTIONS THIS IS A MISUSE OF PROBATION. THAT CAN UNINTENTIONALLY NOT WIDEN USE INTO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM RATHER THAN PREVENT THEM FROM COMING INTO THE SYSTEM. BASED ON MY XPERIA EXPERIENCE I BELIEVE THAT DIVERTING YOU FROM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN INTO COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES SHOULD BE USED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT. AND THAT CONTACT WITH THE JUSTICE SYSTEM SHOULD BE LIMITED. AND WITH THAT I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. NOW WE GET TO WITNESSES AT THE MIKE -- CARES WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. I'LL HANDLE IT ON WITH THE WIDENING GROUP REPRESENTING NEXT IN CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT. IRVING OUR IS YOU JUST COALITION BUSINESS OF COALITION IS WOULD HAVE HELPED ME GREATLY ABOUT IT THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED A LONG TIME AGO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

WOULD KEEP JUST THE DO THE VERY LEAST TO KEEP YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T EVEN COMMITTED A CRIME OR BEEN ACCUSED OF A CRIME. IN SYSTEM IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. ALEJANDRA GUTIERREZ COMMUNITY MEMBER IN STRONG SUPPORT. LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WE DO HAVE SOME SORELY TO MAKE ROOM AT THE TABLE [inaudible] RIGHT. GREAT AHEAD HE GOOD MORNING CHAIRED MEMBERS. ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN ALAMEDA COUNTY -- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT WE SHARE IN ALL OF THE SENTIMENT THAT WE HAVE HEARD. IN OUR GOAL OF KEEPING YOUNG PEOPLE OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. BOTH AS MINORS AS WELL AS AS YOUNG ADULTS -- WE HAVE BEEN ALSO WORKING WITH THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIBSON'S OFFICE ON CERTAIN AMENDMENTS THAT WE WOULD LIKE. TO BRING UP TODAY THAT WE THINK ARE VITAL SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARDS TO THE ASPECTS SURROUNDING TRUANCY CHRONIC TRUANCY IN HAVE VISUAL TRUANCY IN TEENAGERS -- OUR OFFICE. HASBEEN WORKING IN THE FIELD OF COMBATING CHRONIC TRUANCY FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND I HAVE BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR COUNTY THIS WHOLE TIME. AS WELL AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE INCLUDING AROUND THE NATION IN COMBATING TRUANCY. WE'RE KEENLY AWARE. OF THE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES OF YOUNG PEOPLE STARTING IN KINDERGARTEN ALL THE WAY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL WHO MISSED SO MUCH SCHOOL THAT THEIR CHANCES OF GRADUATING BECOME. NOLAN VOID WE KNOW THAT THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY EVENTUALLY TO ENTER THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BOTH AS VICTIMS OF CRIME AS WELL AT TIMES AS THOSE WHO COMMIT CRIMES. WE ALSO ARE VERY WELL AWARE THAT THERE ARE MYRIAD FACTORS UNDERLYING -- SCHOOL ABSENTEEISM. I HAVE RARELY MET A FAMILY WHO JUST AS WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE EDUCATION OF OUR CHILD OR A CHILD HE SAYS. I DON'T CARE ABOUT MY OWN FUTURE. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE IS SCHOOL ANXIETY. UNTREATED MEDICAL ISSUES SUBSTANCE ABUSE BULLYING TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS ISSUES OF HOMELESSNESS AND POVERTY. AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE AS DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND PROBATION ARE ALLOWED TO WORK ALONGSIDE OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS. SUCH AS ASTHMA START AND COUNTY HEALTH CARE TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS. WE KNOW THAT EARLY INTERVENTION ALWAYS IS KEY AND BEST SCHOOL STATE INTERVENTION SCHOOL DISTRICT INTERVENTION. IS THE BEST IN. COMBATING TRUANCY AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF TRUANCY AND COMBATING TRUANCY AS A PYRAMID WITH THE MOST INTENSIVESERVICES. FRONT LOADED OUT THE SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WE KNOW THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND TO HAVE THE CHILDREN NEVER COME BEFORE A COURT. OR A DA OR PROBATION DEPARTMENT HOWEVER. IT IS A TRAGIC AND SAD REALITY THAT THERE ARE STUDENTS AND OUR FAMILIES THAT DESPITE ALL OF THE BEST EFFORTS OF THE SCHOOLS AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. DO NOT TURN AROUND THE ATTENDANCE ISSUE THERE MAY BE MEETING AFTER MEETING AN INTERVENTION AFTER INTERVENTION AND SLOWLY THAT PYRAMID REACHES A PEAK WHERE THE CASE CAN BE REFERRED. TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT -- AND WE WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING ISSUES AND HOPEFULLY. MAKE SURE THAT THIS YOUNG PERSON NEVER ENTERS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM -- CERTAIN AMENDMENTS TO THE STATUTE HOWEVER THIS THIS BILL ARE VITAL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PLAY THE ROLE THAT WE NEED TO PLAY IN THE LIVES OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. FIRST OFF AND I AND AS I SAID WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE SPONSORS DISCUSSING THIS IN DEPTH -- PART OF THE BILL THROWS INTO QUESTION AMBIGUITY WHETHER OR OF MEDIATION PROGRAM WELL THE BILL STILL DOES ALLOW IT WHETHER THAT COULD BE -- NOW CONSIDERED PRETTY EARLY VOLUNTARY ON THE SIDE OF BOTH THE FAMILY AND THE STUDENT AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO CLEAR UP THAT AMBIGUITY AND ENSURE THAT THOSE MEDIATION. PROGRAMS WHEN THEY ARE NECESSARY AND THEY ARE NECESSARY A TIME OR STILL MANDATORY LIKEWISE -- WE ALWAYS TELL EVERY STUDENT THAT WE WORK WITH THAT OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE HERE SHE IS BACK IN SCHOOL AND THRIVING. BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHERE WE DO NEED TO BRING A STUDENT BEFORE JUVENILE COURT SETTING AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WOULD BE WELL AMENDED TO ENSURE THAT ONLY CHILDREN WHO ARE. CHRONICALLY TRUANT AS WE DEFINED IN PENAL CODE SECTION TWO SEVENTY POINT ONE A FEW YEARS AGO AND THAT THE JUVENILE COURT SETTING HAS A DEDICATED AND FULLY ENRICHED TRUANCY COURT. COULD. HOW THIS CASES BROUGHT BEFORE THEM BUT WE DO FEEL THAT IN A VERY CHEMICAL OF THAT PYRAMID -- WE DO VERY GOOD WORK. AND WE REALLY DO CHANGE ABOUT -- THE ATTENDANCE PATTERNS AND THE UNDERLYING FACTORS THAT CREATED THE TRUANCY IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WE WOULD -- WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT. THIS CERTAIN AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE OFFERING WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE THAT VITAL WORK THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS THE MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA -- HERE IN OPPOSITION TODAY I DO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON -- IN HIS OFFICE AN THE SPONSORS FOR CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS AND AND DO YOU WANT TO NOTE THAT AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AND AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT -- BUT WE CAME TO THE TABLE I THINK EARLY ON WITH A VERY MUCH THE SAME SPIRIT AND GOAL WITHIN THIS BILL WHICH IS -- TO PROVIDE INTERVENTION AND DIVERSION SERVICES IN A VERY ROBUST MANNER THAT KEEPS YOU THOUGHT OF THE SYSTEMS WE TO SHARE -- THE CONCERN IN AND FEEL LIKE IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE ABOUT -- LOOKING OUT REFERRALS -- FROM OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THE INTERVENTIONS ARE ARE RIGHT FOR THE FOR THE YOUTH AND THE BEHAVIOR AND SO WE WE COME TO A PLACE I THINK OF OF COMMON GROUND ON THAT -- WHERE WE HAVE CONCERNS THOUGH OR OF REMAINING IN THE BILL -- ARE A FEW PROVISIONS SPECIFIC TO THE MANNER IN WHICH PROBATION SPECIFICALLY A DIVERSION AN INTERVENTION PROGRAMS CAN BE OFFERED -- WE ARE OPEN TO WOULD HAVE PROVIDED LANGUAGE THAT WOULD -- PROVIDE CLARITY ON THOSE SECTIONS WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WITH CONTINUE DISCUSSION SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD ON THAT ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE CAN BE TAKEN TO ADDRESS SOME OF OUR OUR REMAINING CONCERNS -- THERE ARE A FEW PIECES IN THE BILL THAT KIND OF FUNDAMENTALLY RECAST THE MANNER IN WHICH PROBATION CAN OFFER AND IT RE PRIORITIZES WHO CAN OFFER SERVICES PRIOR TO PROBATION. THERE'S A CONCERN THAT THAT DOES NOT REFLECT MANY OF THE WONDERFUL PROGRAMS AND WE CERTAINLY CAN SURE THAT WITH THIS COMMITTEE. THAT ARE ON EXISTING STATEWIDE AT THAT ARE BOTH -- COORDINATED BY PROBATION WITH CBO'S WITH -- PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION AND OTHER TECH THAT OTHER ENTITIES WE DON'T WANT -- THOSE TO BE HARMED OR LOST -- BY NATURE OF THIS BILL -- AND SO AGAIN WE WE CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WE TO SHARE THE SPIRIT WE HAVE SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE REMAINING PIECES IN THE BILL AND AND AGAIN ULTIMATELY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE AND TO ENGINES ARE DONE IN THE RIGHT WAY. WERE OPEN TO THE CONVERSATION AND APPRECIATIVE OF IT -- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING MORE. THANK YOU RIGHT THE OTHER WITNESSES IN. SHARE MEMBERS WORRY WARS. LAURIE MORE SUNDRY HAPPEL BOOK CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION -- WE TO SHARE MANY OF THE AMBITIONS -- WILL OF THIS BILL -- BUT WE HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS -- THAT ASPECTS OF THE BILL WILL -- INHIBIT THE IN INCREDIBLE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE BY DA'S OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS JUVENILE CRIME IS DOWN IN ITS DOWN DRAMATICALLY ACROSS CALIFORNIA -- FIGHT CRIME INVEST IN KIDS -- ROOM RELEASED A LANDMARK STUDY SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT SAID HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS OR SEVEN TIMES. SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO END UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. SO OUR EFFORTS HAVE ALL BEEN DESIGNED TO DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY COULD TO IN INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF STUDENTS GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL AS A FORMER DISTRICT ATTORNEY I MADE IT A NUMBER ONE PRIORITY -- TO WORK WITH THE SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOL OF SCHOOLS AND THE THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AS THE SINGLE. MOST SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION I COULD MAKE AS PROSECUTOR WAS TO GET AS MANY KIDS AS POSSIBLE THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND GRADUATION FOR THE LONG TERM SAFETY OF A COMMUNITY. THAT IS THE ONE LASTING -- IMPACT THAT WE CAN MAKE THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN PLACE ACROSS -- COUNTIES LIKE ALAMEDA AND MONTEREY -- SACRAMENTO OR DOING THIS IMPORTANT WORK EACH AND EVERY DAY AND ARE HAVING A TREMENDOUS IMPACT IN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF KIDS WERE GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL -- AND WHILE WE WE SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED IN THIS BILL WE BELIEVE THE PROVISIONS OF IT -- WILL ACTUALLY **** OR EFFORTS -- TO CONTINUE TO CREATE THESE COLLABORATIVE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN SUCCESSFUL AND WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL THAT -- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILL TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED THEY DO NOT IN ANY WAY -- INHIBIT HIS PROGRAM FROM THEM FROM CONTINUING HIS SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES FROM BEING IMPLEMENTED BUT THEY GIVE T. A.'S THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FASHION COLLABORATIVE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE PROVEN TO WORK. I'D LIKE -- SEVENTY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AT THE MIKE. MADAM CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MICHAEL SIZER ON BEHALF OF THE KERN COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS OFFICE WHEN I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON IS STAFF AND SPONSORS WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF VERY PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS WITH THEM -- WE'VE RAISED CONCERNS THAT THE BILL -- CLEARLY UNINTENTIONALLY WOULD ELIMINATE SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND SUPPORT SERVICES TO STUDENTS. THROUGH COUNTY. IS USUALLY AT THE WITH PARTY HAD THREE SUBSTANTIVE WITNESSES OUT YOUR WE WE JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ME ON WITH THE NEXT SPONSORS WITNESS. THANK YU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JEFF BACA REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. SIMPLY EMPLOYEE OPPOSE THAT'S ALL WE NEED RIGHT NOW KEEP GOING.

ALWAYS ALWAYS DRESSED FOR THE OCCASION -- I APOLOGIZE SAID I DIDN'T HEAR PART OF THIS BUT THE QUESTION I'M ASKING MYSELF -- IS ARE THESE PROGRAMS GOOD FOR OUR KIDS TO THE HELP. TO THE HELP OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE. AT RISK OR AGAINST AND WE WANT TO CALL IT A PROMISE. TO BE -- AT TO TO FIND A BETTER PATH ARE WE ARE WE DISCOVERING THAT THEY THEY DO THESE PROGRAMS TO IN FACT HELP. OUR USE -- FOR IS THERE IT ARE WE CONCERNED THAT THE STATUS OF WORKING WITH PROBATION. WHEN YOU'RE NOT ON PROBATION HAS SUCH A A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION IN A NEGATIVE ASPECT TO IT I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD? WHICH IS KIND OF YOU KNOW GET RIGHT TO THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION SURE I JUST WISH THAT YOU WERE HERE TO HEAR MISS THOMAS. HYDE I DO BELIEVE ME I DO TOO WE SHOULD I WORK HERE -- AND SO WITH HER TESTIMONY -- SHE WAS NOT ON PROBATION. THESE INDIVIDUALS YOU STUDENTS ARE BOUGHT THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM TO THEIR PUSH PUSHED INTO BUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING TREATED LIKE MISS THOMAS INDICATED -- A PROBATION OFFICER ON CAMPUS DRESSED IN BLACK WITH SUNGLASSES REAL QUICK -- CALL HER BY HER LAST NAME AND SAID YOU'RE ON MY LIST WHERE SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. SHE DID SHE DID NOTHING BUT SHE WAS TREATED LIKE SHE DID SOMETHING LIKE SHE BROKE THE LAW AND THIS IS DRAMATIC FOR THOSE AND THOSE STUDENTS. I MEAN HOW I MEAN YOU'RE BEING TREATED AS IF YOU COMMITTED A CRIME AND HAS NOT COMMITTED ANY CRIME WHATSOEVER WOULD YOU BEING TREATED THAT WAY AND THAT IT THAT. WEARS OF THE PSYCHE -- IT CREATES ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS -- THAT WE DON'T WANT TO THEM TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AS YOUNG PEOPLE SO -- YEAH THE THE OBVIOUSLY THE FELONY TO LOW SENSITIVITY TRAINING BUT I'M WONDERING IF THE PROGRAM ITSELF WHICH YOU YOU SAID IS THERE THEY'RE FORCED INTO A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM WHICH TO ME. DEFINITION OF VOLUNTARY -- BUT DO THESE PROGRAMS AND TWO THEY HAVE VALUE TO THEM WHEN THEY ARE. ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS OF THIS DIRE OF THESE YOUTH OR IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS -- THAT THAT EXISTS BECAUSE THE GOAL IS TO HELP THESE KIDS I MEAN ONE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO. ARE A TO TO CITE ONE JERK IF YOU'LL PARDON MY EXPRESSION DOES THAT RUIN THE WHOLE CONCEPT. NO AND LET ME SIMPLY SAY WITH RESPECT TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS THOSE KIDS WHO HAVE NOT COMMITTED CRIMES THOSE KEY IN THOSE KIDS WHO I IN FACT COULD BE -- CAN IT'S FOR PROBATION THOSE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION WORK WITH SCHOOLS WORK THE PARENTS AND TRY TO GET A ROOT AS A MATTER -- TO MAKING SURE THEY DON'T WIND UP IN THE JUSTICE AND WE TALKING ABOUT AGAIN CHILDREN STUDENTS WE DON'T WANT THEM TO WIND UP IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WHATSOEVER AND SO WITH THIS CONCEPT WITH THIS BILL. IT CREATES OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS BOOTS ON THE STREETS BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE SCHOOLS TO WORK WITH THOSE STUDENTS. THANK YOU THE ACLU OR I THINK OKAY I'M AND I APPRECIATE THANK YOU I'M CENTER MORE LIKE SENATOR JACKSON. I MEAN SCAR SENATOR MITCHELL THE THE CINNAMON. GIPSON -- JUST A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS WE ARE.

OKAY GREAT THANKS I I DID I JUST HAD MARK -- I'M CURIOUS. WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE A PILOT PROGRAM IN A COUNTY THAT HAS THE THE A AND THE PROBATION CHIEF. WILLING TO TO TRY IT I IT THIS THIS SEEMS LIKE SUCH A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING. TO CHANGE THE PARADIGM AND I'M I'M WONDERING IF IT SHOULD BE TESTED SOMEWHERE. IN A IN A COUNTY OR TWO BEFORE THE ENTIRE. SYSTEM IS IS IS CHANGE I'M JUST CURIOUS IF IF THAT WAS SOMETHING YOU'D CONSIDERED. SURE LAWS AS THE ALREADY DOES THIS WORK. AND SO THEY ALREADY HAVE A THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATOR MITCHELL. THIS COMMITTEE SB FOUR THREE NINE LAST YEAR WAS A PART OF OUR EQUITY AND JUSTICE PACKAGE -- THAT TALKED ABOUT -- THE CULTURE IN WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES FOR WE'RE CONTINUING TO CRIMINALIZE CHILDREN. OUR AND TO HEAR THE UNIFORM OF THE PROBATION OFFICER IN A PROBATION HAS HAS MORE IN THE CULTURE PROBATION HAS CHANGED. MANY PROBATION OFFICES -- NOW -- ALL CAN CARRY WEAPONS AND THAT'S THAT THAT THAT'S THAT'S A EVOLUTION OF PROBATION DIDN'T USED TO BE THAT WAY PROBATION USED TO BE A VERY DIFFERENT. KIND OF SYSTEM -- AND SO. IT IS TRAGIC THAT SOMEONE ON CAMPUS -- WHO WAS PROFILED ARE IDENTIFIED BY SOMEONE TO PUT HER ON A LIST? WHERE SHE WOULD THEN BE SUBJECTED TO THE THE NEW POLICE ORIENTED PROBATION STYLE -- THAT'S UNFORTUNATE I IT RUNS COUNTER TO THE NOTION OF AS BEFORE THREE NINE IT SAYS THAT IT KNOWLEDGE THE CURRENT RESEARCH THAT SAYS THE YOUNGER CHILDREN A CHILD IN COUNTY JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THE MORE. LIKELY THEY WILL STAY IN IT -- AND IT'S MY HOPE WITH THAT PACKAGE OF LEGISLATION THAT WERE BEGINNING TO CREATE A CULTURE SHIFT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND HOW THEY EXPERIENCE. THE GOVERNOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO MOVE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE OUT OF CORRECTIONS INTO. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS A NOTHER. CULTURE SHIFT SIGNAL -- AND SO. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THOSE THINGS FOR MY COLLEAGUES AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- KIND OF WHAT IS VERSUS WHAT I TO BE ON AND THE CULTURE THE DIRECTION WE ARE HOPING TO GO IN THE STATE. AND SUPPORTING NOT ONLY JUVENILE OFFENDERS. BUT THOSE WHO. ARE PERHAPS AT RISK ARE THOSE WHO ARE PERCEIVED BY THE ADULTS IN THEIR WORLD TO NEED SOME KIND OF SUPPORT INTERACTION. AND WE NEED TO CREATE SYSTEMS IN WHICH THAT SUPPORT COMES FROM PLACES OTHER THE AND PROBATION IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. ON THE FIRST ONE TO ADMIT THAT THERE IS A ROLE FOR PROBATION WELL I MEAN I PERSONALLY AGREE WITH THE DIRECTION THE PROBATION HAS GONE IN RECENT YEARS. I GET THAT THERE IS A ROLE FOR PROBATION BUT THERE'S ALSO A ROLE FOR SUPPORT OUTSIDE OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE MAY HAVE BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE -- WITH THAT I'LL MOVE THE BILL. CENTER MORE LUCK. THANK YOU MA'AM SURE I'M I'M GOING THROUGH THE MATERIALS AND I'M NOT PLANNING ON LA COUNTY IS I DON'T SEE THEM OPPOSING I DON'T SEE THEM SUPPORTING. DO WE HAVE ANY. RESULTS FOR A STUDY OF HOW IT'S WORKING AND BUZZ ANGELES COUNTY -- I DO NOT I DON'T KNOW IF -- ACR NEW ORDERS DAUGHTER JUSTICE HAVE ANYTHING. SERVING SPECIFIC TO THAT QUESTION. OFTEN SOMEONE FROM YOUTH JUSTICE COALITION WHO WORKED ON THAT THAT ISSUE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IF. JUST QUICKLY BECAUSE OF WHAT WE FOUND IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. ON IT WE WORKED WITH THE CHIEF THERE THERE'S TWO CHIEF THERE THERE'S A CHIEF IN CHARGE OF ADULT SERVICES AND A CHIEF IN CHARGE OF YOU SERVICES WITH A SHE FOR PROBATION OVER BOTH OF THEM. AND WE WORK WITH SHEILA MITCHELL TO END THE PRACTICE IN LA COUNTY. AND IN LA COUNTY CHIEF MITCHELL AND OTHER PROVISIONS SUPERVISORS OR MANAGERS FELT THAT IT WAS AN INAPPROPRIATE ROLE FOR PROBATION TO PLAY. AND HOW LONG HAS THAT BEEN GOING ON IT WAS ADDED IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAVE EVIDENCE ALTHOUGH IT WAS INDEED ENDED INTO THE IN THE SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE BECAUSE OF STATE LAW REQUIRING. THE CHANGED TO MAKE IT A PERMANENT CHANGE WE NEED TO GO TO A LOT OF MAKE A PERMIT CHANGE NOT ONLY FOR OUR COUNTY. BUT FOR COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WAS GOING ON THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR TWENTY YEARS. BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS REAL CONCERN FOR LA COUNTY IN THE REST THE STATE. IS THAT THERE IS AN CLEAR SUPERVISION OR OVERSIGHT OR COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE OF THESE PROGRAMS IT WAS ALSO USING JJ CPA MONEY THAT WAS ATTENDED FOR COMMUNITY. BASED PREVENTION SERVICES -- AND SO IT WAS THROUGH AN AUDIT AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THAT THE PROGRAM WAS EVEN THE IDENTIFIED AS EXISTING -- SO NO ONE IS TOTALLY SURE HOW LONG WAS GOING ON BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN. FOR A MORE THAN A DECADE POSSIBLY AS MANY AS EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS IN DIFFERENT FORMS HI. RIGHT RIGHT CHAU TOOK SO MISS SANCHEZ MAYBE YOU COULD HELP ME OUT. LA COUNTY IS 25% OF THE POPULATION OF THE STATE AND SO THEY ARE MEMBER OF COURSE OF YOUR ASSOCIATION. CAN YOU HELP ME OUT WITH. WHY WOULD YOU BE OPPOSED IF IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN? WORKING LA COUNTY. SO SPEAK UP A LITTLE BIT MORE GLOBALLY STATEWIDE THERE'S EXTENSIVE PROGRAMS -- STATEWIDE THAT ARE UNDER KIND OF THAT THAT -- CODE SECTION FIVE PERTAINING TO THE EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION TYPE PROGRAMS -- I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF WHAT IS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE BILL IS THE DIFFERENCES AND COUNTY RESOURCES DYNAMICS THAT THAT NOT ALL OF THEM ARE RESOURCE THE SAME WAY AND SO WE WANT TO OF COURSE MAKE SURE -- THAT PROGRAMS -- PROGRAM DELIVERIES DESIGNED IN A WAY IN WHICH AND SOMETIMES IT IS -- PROBATION WORKING IN COORDINATION ITH -- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OTHER TIMES IT'S WITH PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION SOMETIMES IT'S PROBATION OFFERING THE DRUG SERVICES A PROVISIONS BEEN TRAINED EXTENSIVELY IN TRAUMA INFORMED CARE -- AND MANY OF THE APPROACHES THAT I THINK WE ALL TALK ABOUT AND WANT TO SEE HAPPEN AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THOSE -- THOSE TYPES OF RECKONING RECOGNITIONS I THINK ARE BUILT ON INTO THIS BILL AND SO I AM AS I MENTIONED WE HAD COME KIND OF TO THE TABLE EARLY ON AND WORKED WITH THE SPONSORING THE AUTHOR ON SOME. CLEAR FINE LANGUAGE AROUND -- PARTICULAR CODE SECTIONS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CHANGES WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO THAT WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR OPEN TO THOSE ADDITIONAL CHANGES -- BECAUSE WE AGAIN I THINK WANNA WORK WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT ON THE INTERVENTIONS ARE TAKING PLACE IN THE WAY THAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE THEM HAPPEN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CERTAINLY -- WE WILL NOT BE TAKEN AMENDMENTS IN THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE THAT CAN BILL HAS TO GO TO EDUCATION AND WE DID NOT HAVE THE MINUTES TO RECOMMEND BUT CERTAINLY IF THE AUTHOR. IN -- IS. LOOKING AT ANY THAT IS THE PLACE TO DO THAT. I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL AND I FEEL THAT -- WELL THERE MAY BE SOME VERY GOOD PROGRAMS EITHER WITHIN OUR DI DA OR PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. IN GENERAL AS OF BOTH THE AUTHOR AND SENATOR MITCHELL EXPRESSED. I DON'T THINK THAT. EITHER PROBATION WERE THE THIS IS AN THE PROBLEM OF STUDENTS NOT GOING TO SCHOOL. IF THEY'VE NOT COMMITTED A CRIME SHOULD NOT BE DEALT WITH. IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ARENA. AND BEGIN WITH APPRECIATION THAT THERE ARE. THESE EFFORTS -- AND IF I LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WE KNOW THAT. THE ISSUES AROUND AS STUDENT BEING TRUANT OFTEN OCCUR VERY VERY EARLY THEY KERR FROM KINDERGARTEN FIRST GRADE. SO THERE WAS SOME RESEARCH DONE BECAUSE OAKLAND HAD A VERY HIGH TRUANCY RATE IN KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE. AND THE CHECKED AND WHAT A DEFINED -- UST DOES NOT PROVIDE A SERVICE. AND THE PARENTS OF THESE CHILDREN EITHER HAD SUCH WORK SCHEDULES THAT THEY WERE UNABLE THEMSELVES TO GET THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL. WHERE THEY HAD -- DISABILITIES OR OTHER ISSUES AND SO IT WAS BASICALLY PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET. THEIR STUDENT TO SCHOOL. AND OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT DIDN'T PROVIDE ANY RESOURCES TO GET THE KIDS TO SCHOOL. SO THESE SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE REALLY THINGS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS IN A IN OTHER WAYS. AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRINGING THE BILL -- OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE ANOTHER COMMITTEE TO GO [inaudible] TO AND THE WE'LL SEE HOW THE THINK WE HAVE A MOTION SIR CORRECT DID YOU MOVE IT SENATOR MITCHELL. OKAY GREAT THREE OF MOTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST -- CONVERSATION ON THIS MATTER -- JUST LET ME SAY TO MISS THOMAS -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I THINK WAS VERY COMPELLING -- THAT'S REASON WHY WE HAVE THIS BILL HERE TODAY AND CONTINUE TO BE -- A VOICE FOR THE VOICELESS IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA -- THIS IS A BILL THAT I THINK THAT IT WILL BENEFIT OUR STUDENTS MOVING FORWARD -- WE SHOULD NOT BE TRAUMATIZING OUR YOUTH. SIMPLE AS THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE TRAUMATIZING YOU AND ALSO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE CAUGHT UP IN THE SYSTEM IT'S IT'S I THINK. WHAT YOU SEE TAKING PLACE IN THIS LEGISLATURE IS ADISPOSITION TO WE WANT RESTORE OF JUSTICE WE WANT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE ABLE -- TO GET IT RIGHT AND HAVE ALL THE RESOURCE AND THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THAT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IS THAT VEHICLE THOSE IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. THOSE INDIVIDUALS CAN GO INTO THEHOME CAN GO INTO COMMUNITY AND PROVIDE THE KIND OF SUPPORT THAT'S NECESSARY FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO GET ON THE RIGHT TRACK I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE. FORTY MOTION IS -- DO YOU PASSED THE SENATE EDUCATION LET'S TO ROLL CALL. SKINNER BY INNER AYE MOORLACH BRADFORD. JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MORALE [inaudible] NO WIENER. FOR THE BILL'S ON CALL. SHE ATE THE ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY -- WE WILL NOW GO TO ITEMS CAN AB. NINE OH SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. APOLOGIES OTHER MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN WAITING WE DO FILE ORDER IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON DID ARRIVE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON IF YOU COULD COME UP. THANK YOU. KEEP THIS MOVING [inaudible] EXCELLENT [inaudible] PERCY. THANK YOU AND I DO HAVE MY WITNESSES COMING UP. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR TIME AND ATTENTION ON THE BILL. AB NINE ZERO SEVEN SIX TO ADD CLARITY TO THE LAW REGARDING CRIMINAL THREATS. WHITE SUPREME IS PROPAGANDA. AND SCHOOL SHOOTING INCIDENTS HAVE REACHED AN ALL TIME HIGH IN OUR COUNTRY. AND MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY FEEL MORE FREER THAN EVER BEFORE. OUR NEWSPAPERS AND NEWS FEEDS ARE FILLED WITH TERRIBLE HEADLINES OF CRIMES BEING COMMITTED AGAINST TARGETED GROUPS OF PEOPLE. OVER FIFTY MUSLIMS MURDERED IN A MOSQUE IN NEW ZEALAND. ELEVEN JEWISH WORSHIPPERS MURDERED IN A SYNAGOGUE IN PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA. A PREDOMINANTLY BLACK CHURCH IN KENTUCKY TARA IN KENTUCKY TARGETED BY A GUNMAN SCHOOL CHILDREN MURDERED AT SANDY HOOK AND AT PARKLAND JUST TO NAME A FEW. IN CASES WHEN AN ENTIRE SCHOOL OR PLACE OF WORSHIP IS THREATENED IT'S CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD TO BE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE IN DANGER AND NOT THE PROPERTY IN DANGER. BUT THE LAW IS LESS CLEAR WHEN A STUDENT SEES A POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT ANOTHER STUDENT WANTS TO KILL AT LEAST THIRTY STUDENTS ON THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL THE FEAR THEY FEEL IS VERY REAL. THE EXAMPLE IS A REAL ONE THAT HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT AND PLEASANTVILLE. DESPITE THAT COMMUNICATED THREATS INTERVENTION BY THE FBI AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MULTIPLE GUNS BEING SEIZED FROM THE STUDENTS HOME AND MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALS AFRAID FOR THEIR SAFETY. PROSECUTORS WERE STILL UNABLE TO PURSUE A CRIMINAL THREAT CHARGE BECAUSE OF HOW THE LAW IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. AFTER A THREAT WAS MADE AGAINST THE SCHOOL IN THE JOHNS WHAT SCHOOL DISTRICT IN MY DISTRICT THAT WAS A MASSIVE ATTENDANCE FLUCTUATION. DAILY ATTENDANCE WAS REDUCED FROM FOUR HUNDRED NINETY TWO STUDENTS TO ONLY SEVENTY AND REMAIN LOW FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS FOLLOWING THE THREAT. DRASTICALLY IMPACTING THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT THE SCHOOL RECEIVED VIA E.. EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT THESE THREATS ARE HURTING STUDENTS HURTING SCHOOLS AND HURTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND THERE SHOULD BE UNIFORM AGREEMENT ON HOW TO ADDRESS THOSE WHO PURPOSEFULLY. BECAUSE FEAR IN OUR COMMUNITIES CURRENT STATUTE FAILS TO ENCOMPASS WELL WE WERE ALL CONSIDERED TO BE A CRIME DUE TO THE LAWS AND BIG AMBIGUITY. THE INTENT IS TO ENSURE ALL THREATS ARE TREATED WITH THE GRAVITY THEY DEMAND MY WITNESS IS LARRY MORSE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. GO AHEAD MISTER MOORE'S THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- BLURRY MORE SOMEBODY HAVE TO CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WE ARE PLEASED TO BE A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AS WE ALL KNOW FAR TOO WELL IN RECENT YEARS ARE RISK POOLS AND PLACES OF WORSHIP. HAVE BECOME THE SCENES OF HORRIFIC ACTS OF GUN VIOLENCE OFTEN INVOLVING SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF LIFE AND INJURIES. NOT SURPRISINGLY WE HAVE ALSO SEEN A CORRESPONDING AND DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF THREATS OF SUCH ACTS OF VIOLENCE OFTEN THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. WHEN A THREAT IS MADE TO COMMIT MASS MURDER AT A SCHOOL OR HOUSE OF WORSHIP? IT OFTEN CREATES PURE PANDEMONIUM BECAUSE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SO MANY OF THESE TRAGIC SHOOTINGS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES IN CHURCHES SYNAGOGUES AND MOSQUES THERE IS A HEIGHTENED ANXIETY WHEN EVER SUCH A NEW THREAT IS MADE. LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH NOW MAKES ACTIVE SHOOTER SCENARIOS ON THEIR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TRAINING FOR OFFICERS IS CALLED INTO IMMEDIATE ACTION. SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ARE FORCED TO CLOSE CAMPUSES AND ISSUE ALERTS. TERROR STRICKEN PARENTS GRIPPED WITH FEAR JUMP IN THEIR CARS AND SPEED OVER TO THEIR CHILDREN'S SCHOOLS PRAYING THAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN PLACES LIKE PARKLAND FLORIDA. AND ELSEWHERE IS NOT HAPPENING NOW AT THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL. UNDER EXISTING LAW SUCH THREATS TO COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE THAT SCHOOLS ARE PLACES OF WORSHIP. HAVE BEEN SHOEHORNED INTO PENAL CODE SECTION. FOUR TWENTY TWO WHILE THE ANALYSIS NOTES THAT SOME CASES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTED UNDER -- PENAL CODE SECTION FOUR TWENTY TWO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE CITING APPELLATE DECISIONS. SUGGEST THAT THERE IS SOME AMBIGUITY IN THE APPLICATION OF PC FOR TWENTY TWO TO THESE CASES. THE AMBIGUITY STEMS FROM SECTION HE A PENAL CODE FOR TWENTY TWO WHICH SAYS QUOTE. BUT THE THREAT ACTUALLY BECAUSE THE PERSON THREATEN TO BE IN SUSTAIN FEAR FOR HIS OR HER OWN SAFETY OR FOR HIS OR HER IMMEDIATE FAMILY SAFETY. IN MOST INSTANCES OF FOUR TWENTY TWO PROSECUTION FLOWS FROM A PERSON DIRECTLY CALLING ANOTHER. ON THE PHONE FOR EXAMPLE AND THREATENING TO COME OVER AND SHOOT THEM. SUCH A THREAT MAY VERY WELL CALL BECAUSE THAT PERSON WHO RECEIVED THE CALL TO BE IN SUSTAIN FEAR OF HIS OR HER OWN SAFETY. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT LANGUAGE IN THE CONTEXT OF THREATS TO SCHOOL CAMPUSES OR HOUSES OF WORSHIP IS THAT OF SOMEONE POST ONLINE OR COMMUNICATES TO SOMEONE ELSE. THAT THEY'RE PLANNING TO COMMIT MASS MURDER AT A SCHOOL OR HOUSE OF WORSHIP. THE PERSON THAT RECEIVES THAT COMMUNICATION MAY NOT BE IN SUSTAIN FEAR FOR HIS LIFE. OR THE LIVES OF FAMILY MEMBERS IN MOST SCHOOL SHOOTING INCIDENTS AT LEAST ONE OTHER PERSON WAS AWARE OF THE SHOOTERS PLANTS ALTHOUGH THAT PERSON MAY NOT. AND LIKELY WAS NOT INTENDED AS A TARGET OF THE THREAT. SUCH VAGUE ONE SIZE FITS ALL STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION. IS IN ADEQUATE TO THE GRAVITY OF THE KINDS OF THREATS AB NINE OH SEVEN ADDRESSES OR LAW SHOULD BE QUICK CLEAR AND UNEQUIVOCAL IN SPECIFYING WHAT CONDUCT IS A LEGAL NOT DRAFTED SO AN ARTFULLY THAT THEY ARE RELIANT ON THE INTERPRETATION. OF APPELLATE COURTS. AB NINE OH SEVEN WOULD END THE AB ACUITY OF WHETHER PC SECTION FOR TWENTY TWO IS LEGALLY SUFFICIENT TO CHARGE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE THESE RECKLESS IRRESPONSIBLE LIFE ENDANGERING THREATS. THAT STATES WITH CLARITY THE ELEMENTS NECESSARY TO CHARGE THE CRIME OF THREATENING A SCHOOL OR PLACE OF WORSHIP. IT ALSO GIVES PROSECUTORS THE ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE SERIOUSNESS AN ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES OF SUCH A THREAT AND DECIDE WHETHER THIS CONDUCT AMOUNTED TO A MISDEMEANOR OR A FELONY. AB NINE OH SEVEN IS A REFLECTION OF THE SAD REALITY OF THE TIMES IN WHICH WE LIVE. A TIME IN WHICH OUR SCHOOLS AND HOUSES OF WORSHIP ONE SANCTUARIES OF SAFETY AND SECURITY ARE NOW POTENTIAL KILLING FIELDS. WE NEED THE UNEQUIVOCAL CLARITY THAT AB NINE OF SEVEN OFFERS TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT WHILE WE CHERISH AND FIGHT FOR STREET FREE SPEECH THOSE WHO STRIKE TERROR INTO INNOCENT PEOPLE BY CONVEYING THREATS OF VIOLENCE TO OUR CHILDREN AND THOSE WHO WORSHIP. WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN CLEAR AND UNMISTAKABLE LANGUAGE WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ARRIVAL -- LET'S HEAR FROM THE NEXT WITNESS AT THE TABLE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CLIFFORD HERE IN BEHALF OF THE JEWISH PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE J. PACK IN SUPPORT. OF AB NINE OH SEVEN UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE SEEN IN A RECORD HIGH AA OF SCHOOL THAN VIOLENCE INCIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE SEEN. A SURGE OF ANTI SEMITIC. ACTS ON CAMPUSES IN A PLACES OF WORSHIP WE HAVE SEEN A SURGE A WHITE SUPREMACIST PROPAGANDA -- THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AND ON THE INTERNET -- VIOLENCE AGAINST PLACES OF WORSHIP AND SCHOOLS OF GRABBED NATIONAL HEADLINES WE'VE SEEN RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN SAN DIEGO -- FAIRLY RECENTLY IT'S ANOTHER TRAGIC EXAMPLE -- THIS BILL IS NEEDED AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR CARING IT THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE MIKE. MAURITANIAN BEHALF OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER SO OFTEN IN SUPPORT. CORY SOCIAL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHERS OKAY LET'S SEE FROM OUR WITNESSES OR HEAR FROM OUR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND I THINK THERE'S ROOM AT THE TABLE WE DON'T HAVE TO MOVE ANYONE YET [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED. KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- WHAT WE OF COURSE SHARE THE GOAL OF STOPPING THREATS TO SCHOOLS AND HOUSES OF WORSHIP UNFORTUNATELY AB NINE OH SEVEN WILL DO NOTHING TO LESSEN THE NUMBER OF THOSE THREATS? AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS OF AND AS DISCUSSED -- IN THE TESTIMONY THE THREATS COVERED UNDER THIS BILL CAN ALREADY BE PROSECUTED UNDER EXISTING LAW WE WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE D. A.'S THAT -- UNTIL IT DECISION IN IN THEIR FAVOR SHOWS THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION AYE I THINK THAT THE COURTS HAVE SPOKEN AND AND IT'S CLEAR HOW THE LAW APPLIES AND AND THERE'S NO NEED FOR THIS BILL -- AT ANY RATE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO OVERCOME BY ANGER THAT THEY MAKE THESE KINDS OF THREATS WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONSEQUENCES WILL NOT STOP BECAUSE THE BILL HAS BEEN PASSED. BY EIGHTY NINE OH SEVEN IS UNNECESSARY AND WE CHERNOBYL. THERE ARE TWO OF US WE HAVE TO GO DOWN VOTE IN ENERGY. SO APOLOGIES ARE WOULD CONTINUE THE TESTIMONY BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE COMMENT. THAT -- AND MAYBE WE CAN -- PAUSE JUST BRIEFLY WHY WE GO VOTE BUT I APPRECIATE THE MOTIVATION FOR THE BILL. AND I WONDERED IF WE WOULDN'T CONSIDER. BECAUSE IT RIGHT NOW THIS WOULD MAKE IT A WAFFLER -- SO THERE'S DISCRETION WHICH IS GREAT BUT I WONDER IF WE MIGHT CONSIDER HAVING FOR MINORS BE A MISDEMEANOR. AND I WOULD EXPLAIN MY LOGIC -- LATER BUT I NEED TO RUN DOWN AND VOTE. AND WE COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION. PROCEED OKAY THANK YOU. LESLIE CALDWELL WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE DO LIVE IN EXTREMELY PAINFUL TIMES WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS ATTACKING CHURCHES AND SYNAGOGUES AND MOSQUES. AND ANGRY OFTEN MENTALLY ILL YOUNG PEOPLE. SHOOTING IN SCHOOLS. AS THE MOTHER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN THE SPOUSE OF AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN AS WELL AS A PERSON OF DEEP FAITH. AND THE DEEPLY CONCERNED CITIZEN I FEEL THE DESPERATE DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING TO STOP THIS HORRIBLE ATTACKS. WE ALL WANT TO DO SOMETHING TO STOP THIS HORRIBLE ATTACKS HOWEVER AB NINE OH SEVEN IS NOT THE SOLUTION. AB NINE OH SEVEN WOULD EXPAND THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF CRIMINAL THREATS AND CREATE A NEW CRIME OF CRIMINAL THREATS IN THE CONTEXT OF A SCHOOL A PLACE OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP. THE CURRENT STATUTE REGARDING CRIMINAL THREATS IS ONE OF GREAT CONCERN FOR PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ACROSS THE STATE. AS A FELONY IT IS A SERIOUS FELONY AND IS IS A STRIKE AS IN THREE STRIKES. THE CURRENT STATUTE IS OFTEN MISUSED TO PENALIZE CONDUCT THAT DOES NOT TRULY BELONG IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR OUR CLIENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WHO OFTEN SUFFER FROM CRIPPLING PARANOIA AND DELUSIONS. THE FEAR THESE CLIENTS EXPERIENCE CAN LEAD THEM TO SAY THINGS THAT ARE EASILY MISINTERPRETED OR SIMPLY A PRODUCT OF THEIR ILLNESS. WE HAVE A A DEEP THIS DISAGREEMENT WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND BELIEVE THAT WHAT. THE AUTHOR SEEKS -- TO DO IS ALREADY COVERED BY THE CURRENT LAW AS MY COLLEAGUE HAS TESTIFID. I'D LIKE TO GIVE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES. ROGER IS A MARINE CORPS VET AND SUFFERS FROM PTSD AND BIPOLAR DEPRESSION WITHOUT HIS MEDS HE LIVES IN FLORIDA BUT WAS HERE FOR A MARINE CORPS REUNION. HE DIDN'T BRING ENOUGH MEDS AND AS A RESULT OF AN EPISODE OF HEARING VOICES AND SMELLING DEAD BODIES THAT REQUIRED HIM TO BE FIFTY ONE FIFTY EIGHT AND HOSPITALIZED. HOWEVER THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM THAT IS SYMPTOMS DIDN'T MEET THE CRITERIA AND THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ADMITTED. AND HE WOULD NOT BE GIVEN MEDICATION. THE VETERAN COMPLAIN TO THE DISCHARGE PLANNER AND ASKED HER WHAT THE CRITERIA WAS AND SHE TOLD HIM A DANGER TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS. HE TOLD HER HE WAS THINKING ABOUT GETTING A GUN AND SHOOTING HIMSELF OR THE STAFF. HE WAS. THEN CHARGED WITH A FELONY FOR TWENTY TWO CRIMINAL THREATS. BRIAN WAS IN HIS FIFTIES AND MENTALLY ILL HE WAS OFF HIS MEDICATION AND TOLD A FRIEND HE WAS GOING TO BLOW THE BUILDING UP. HIS FRIEND CALLED THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH ASKING FOR HELP WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THE POLICE ARRIVED AND PROMPTLY ARRESTED HIM FOR A FELONY. FOR TWENTY TWO WHAT WAS DESCRIBED IN EARLIER TESTIMONY ABOUT THE TERROR OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS DRIVING TO THE SCHOOLS OR THE PLACES OF WORSHIP -- IS VERY MOVING HOWEVER THAT IS COVERED IN SUBSECTION EAT AGAIN I STATE THAT THE LAW ALREADY ALLOWS FOR THESE PROSECUTIONS. FURTHER EXPANDING THIS ALREADY EXPANSIVE DOVE DEFINITION WILL WE FAIR ONLY IN SNARE EVEN MORE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE ARE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE INTENT BEHIND THIS BILL BUT EXPANSION OF PENAL CODE SECTION FOR TWENTY TWO IS NOT THE ANSWER AND IT WILL END UP CREATING MORE HARM. THAN IT PROPOSES TO PREVENT. WE HAVE A BIRD IN THE OTHER FOR THERE ARE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CNN WILL OPEN IT UP TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS. THIRTY JACKSON YES A MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE BILL'S STILL ALLOWS FOR THIS TO BE A WAFFLER. SO THAT DEPENDING UPON THE SEVERITY OF THE BEHAVIOR. THE COURT WILL HAVE THE RIGHT. TO ADJUSTED EITHER IS A FELONY OR MISDEMEANOR IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS -- THAT IS CORRECT AND BEFORE A CHAIR SKINNER -- LEFT SHE HAD MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT -- MISDEMEANOR FOR MINORS RIGHT AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE VERY MUCH -- WILLING TO ACCOMMODATE [inaudible] YEAH I'M. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT -- YOU KNOW THIS BEHAVIORS ARE ALWAYS LEARNED. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT BUT SOME OF THE ACTS THAT ARE COMMITTED HAVE SUCH SIGNIFICANCE TO THE VICTIMS WHO ARE THE RECIPIENTS OF THAT BEHAVIOR. WHETHER IT'S IN HIGH SCHOOL THINKING MINORS IN HIGH SCHOOL -- HI I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF GIVING THE THE COURT DISCRETION BUT CERTAINLY. I THINK THE BILL IS. THE AS CONCEIVED THE ISSUE HERE IS AN IMPORTANT ONE AND SO I I'LL MOVE THE BILL -- AND IF YOU IF YOU CONSIDER -- THE OPTION OF REDUCING IT TO A MISDEMEANOR -- CERTAINLY. THAT'S THAT SEEMS FINE BUT I ALSO THINK THAT SOME OF THIS BEHAVIOR JUST REALLY -- KNOCKS YOUNGSTERS OFF THEIR PENS A FEW WILL HAVING BEEN THE RECIPIENT OF ACTS OF ANTI SEMITISM AS A CHILD IN MY OWN SCHOOL AND SOME OF YOU KNOW. SCHOOLS AND AND PLAYGROUNDS AND ALL. I CAN STILL REMEMBER THOSE EVENTS AND THEY HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO. SO I I I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD TREAT THIS CAVALIERLY -- I DO THINK SOME OF THIS BEHAVIOR SADLY IS MALICIOUS MEAN SPIRITED AND INTENTIONAL. SO I THINK -- GIVING GIVEN THE COURTS SAID DISCRETION IS IS STILL A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS SENATOR JACKSON EGISTO ONCE AGAIN TO REITERATE -- THAT AS SENATOR CHAIR AND CHAIR SKINNER HAD MENTIONED ABOUT -- REDUCING IT FOR MINORS TO MISDEMEANOR THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE THIS BOTH THE SPONSOR AND I I AS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCOMMODATE. AS WE MOVE THIS BILL IF THIS BILL WAS TO MOVE FORWARD. RIGHT APOLOGIES FOR MY HAVING TO RUN OUT. AND APOLOGIES -- FOR NOT HAVING -- I DON'T LIKE TO SURPRISE AUTHORS WITHIN TEN MINUTES -- SO I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APOLOGIES FOR THAT BUT IN. IN. LISTEN TESTIMONY IN RE READING IT THIS MORNING. I THOUGHT ABOUT THE THE HORRIBLE RISE IN THESE [inaudible] IN. THESE TYPE OF THREATS AND DAD TO WOOD THE DATA WOULD SHOW. THAT IT'S REALLY INCREASE SINCE THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION -- AND THE AMOUNT OF SOCIAL MEDIA. AND OTHER SOURCES THAT CAN INFLAME OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. TO DO STUPID THINGS. IN TWO AS OUR AS MISTER MORRIS FROM THE DA ASSOCIATION DESCRIBE THE THE THE D. REALLY ON THE STRESS THE DESTRUCTION. THE REALLY HORRENDOUS A FAX OF THESE THREATS EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT MADE GOOD ON AND YET. WHEN IT'S IMMATURE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN EFFECT BEING MANIPULATED? BY THIS -- BY WHAT'S PRESENT NOW SO MUCH MORE DOMINANT IN EVEN BY LEADERS OF OUR COUNTRY. IT S. SEEM TO ME THAT -- WHILE WE WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STOP IT. WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION OF CREATING A FELONY FOR A MINOR -- CERTAINLY ANYONE WHO'S AN ADULT WHO. BEHAVES THIS WAY IT SEEMS THE WAFFLER AS AND WHEN I REFLECTED ON IT WAS VERY APPROPRIATE -- SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS AND AGAIN MY APOLOGIES FOR NOT -- HAVING. BEEN ABLE TO DISCUSS IN ADVANCE BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT MY ON FEELINGS ABOUT IT REALLY GOT CEMENTED HERE IN THE COMMITTEE AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF OUR HEARINGS ACTUALLY. SO ON THE SAME TIME I APOLOGIZE I ALSO THINK IT'S ALWAYS APPROPRIATE FOR ALL OF US TO RESERVE THE RIGHT. TO BE ABLE TO IN THESE HEARINGS IN THESE DISCUSSIONS -- SO. FIVE WITH YOUR WILLINGNESS WE WILL -- AMENDED IN I THROUGH THE COMMITTEE AND OF COURSE WILL WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORDING IS. SATISFACTORY. ON INDUCTION WAITING ACT CLEAR FIVE CORRECT STAFF OKAY. SO IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTERS QUESTION. YES YES YES. PLEASE TAKE IN IT YES SO IS THERE ANY OTHER QUESTION OR DO WE ALREADY HAVE A MOTION I THINK WE DO SENATOR JACKSON I THINK MATED SAT CORRECT RIGHT SO WE HAVE MOTION AS AMENDED AND YOU MAY CLOSE. OUT OF JAIL THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR INSIGHT AND THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ALRIGHT WE'LL DO ROLL CALL. ASSIST TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. BY YOUR AYE MOORLACH. WELL LIKE I BRADFORD. JACKSON FIVE JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. AYE MITCHELL AYE MORALE. MORRELL AYE WIENER. RIGHT THE BILL IS ON CALL AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS YOUR LAST ONE TODAY -- THE CASE SO. WE WILL NOW GO TO MISUSE IN THE ROOM I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY WOULD BE NEXT. AND THEN AS YOU COME UP TO THE DÃ­AS I WANT ANNOUNCED THAT -- WE WILL STOP AT ELEVEN FORTY FIVE DUE -- TO CAUCUS. WE DO HAVE A ROOM FOR IF THE WE ARE NOT COMPLETED OUR BILLS WE THREE ONE NINE ONE THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO RETURN TO OF COURSE I WILL MAKE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT AGAIN AT THE POINT THAT WE RCESSED. BUT I WANTED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW NOW. DONE JUST IN CASE. ALRIGHT SO LET'S GO WITH ITEM FOURTEEN AB [inaudible] ELEVEN EIGHTY FIVE HE'S CLEARLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M I'M HERE TO PRESENT THE FIRST BILL AB. ELEVEN EIGHTY FIVE F. MEASURE RELATED TO SHERIFF OVERSIGHT BOARDS -- THIS NOTE FROM THE GET GO AND THERE'S SOME CONFUSION HERE THIS DOESN'T MANDATE THESE ENTITIES ARE STILL VOLUNTARY. ACROSS CALIFORNIA IT JUST CLARIFIES -- THEIR EXISTENCE AND AVAILABILITY AND FRANKLY CODIFIES A PRIOR COURT DECISION LATEST SOME CONFUSION OVER THESE ENTITIES -- THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THE SHERIFF IS UNIQUE THEY'RE BOTH INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CHANGE THAT OTHER IS -- OVERSIGHT IN CERTAIN COUNTIES BUT THERE IT IS A LOT OF CONFUSION OVER THEIR FUNCTIONS. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE KNOW THAT CITY POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE LAW IN CITIES HAVE LONG ESTABLISHED OVERSIGHT BODIES. FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CREATE POSITIVE CHANGE IN CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO LA IN SACRAMENTO. THIS CANNOT ALWAYS BE THE SAME FOR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SAT HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE HAD A WELL PUBLICIZED CONFLICT BETWEEN OUR SHARE. AND OVERSIGHT ENTITY WERE LITERALLY ARE SERRA LOCK THE DOORS AND DIDN'T ALLOW THE INDEPENDENT -- INSPECTOR GENERAL TO TO DO HIS JOB ANYMORE. WE'VE SEEN A FURTHER CONFUSION IN LOS ANGELES AND BAY AREA AND IT ALL GOES BACK TO THE UNDERLYING. STRUCTURE THESE AND CONFUSION AS FAR AS THEIR EXISTENCE AND WHETHER OR NOT. THE COUNTY COUNCIL'S TRULY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO AND CALIFORNIA THIS IS A BIG ISSUE BECAUSE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS ARE MANY TIMES THE LOCAL POLICE. I HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN IN LA COUNTY MANY TIMES THE SHERIFF IS ESSENTIALLY THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. WE KNOW THAT IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES RECALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE HAD TOO MUCH DISTRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. A TRANSPARENCY WITH OVERSIGHT IS A GOOD THING A SUNSHINE IS A GOOD THING AND THE BEST DISINFECTANT. AND THIS BILL WILL HELP -- FURTHER THAT GOAL AND SIMPLY CLARIFIED THAT SURE OVERSIGHT BOARDS I HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THEIR WORK -- AND CAN BE ROBUST NGUYEN ISSUED BY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR BY THE PEOPLE OF THAT COUNTY. AND CLARIFY THE CAN DO THINGS LIKE ISSUING SUBPOENAS AND GATHER INFORMATION TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT OF LOCAL SHERIFF DEPARTMENTS. WITH ME TODAY ARE LOCAL LAW PROFESSOR FROM LOYAL SCHOOL OF LAW. AND DAY -- PUBLIC DEFENDER FROM SOLANO COUNTY WITH THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S ASSOCIATION. SB RIVAL THANK YOUTHANK YOU LET'S HAVE OUR WITNESSES IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AB MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS FOR SILOED CHANNEL I'M A PROFESSOR PROFESSOR OF LAW AT LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES. AND MOST PERTINENT FOR THIS DISCUSSION I'M THE VICE CHAIR. OF THE LOS ANGELES SHARE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I'M HERE IN MY INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY TO DISCUSS WHY IT IS SO VITAL TO ENSURE THE COUNTIES CAN ONE ESTABLISH. CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMISSIONS AND TO VEST THOSE BODIES WITH THE POWER TO ISSUE SUBPOENAS WHEN THE NEED ARISES. THESE TWO PROVISIONS ARE CRITICAL TO INSURING TRANSFERRED TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- TWO SHARES WHO ARE ELECTED ONCE EVERY FOUR YEARS OFTEN IN VERY LOW TURNOUT ELECTIONS IN THERE FOR OPERATE DAY TODAY -- WITH VERY LITTLE OVERSIGHT FROM THE PUBLIC WHICH HAS PRODUCED A OFTEN A CATASTROPHIC EVENT. RESULTS IN TERMS OF PUBLIC TRUST AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHICH IS HOME TO ONE OF THE LARGEST SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY ARE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT BODY HAS STEPPED IN TO FILL AN IMPORTANT THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF BRIDGE BUILDING BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY. AND THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. COMMUNITY COME A COMMUNITY MEMBERS COME TO US WITH QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS WE FOLLOW UP WE INVESTIGATE WE ASK QUESTIONS ON THEIR BEHALF WE ALSO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS. ARE COMMISSION TAKES ON PRESSING MATTERS OF PUBLIC CONCERN INVOLVING THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AS IT RELATES TO DEPUTY DISCIPLINE OF COOPERATION WITH FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES. A SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES OF VICTIMS OF POLICE VIOLENCE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT JUST TO NAME A FEW. WHILE WE OFTEN WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AT TIMES OUR WORK IS BEEN IMPEDED BY REFUSAL TO PROVIDE TIMELY AND COMPLETE INFORMATION OR TO MAKE SURE THAT RELEVANT DECISION MAKERS ARE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSION. FOR EXAMPLE FOR MONTHS THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT REFUSED TO PROVIDE THE COMMISSION WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE OPERATION OF DEPUTY GANGS OR CLIQUES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT -- AND EFFORTS TO ROOT THEM OUT. WHEN WE WERE REVISING RECOMMEND IT WOULD DEVISING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMMIGRATION IN OUR COUNTY JAILS THIS YEAR'S DEPARTMENT REFUSED TO PROVIDE US WITH A LIST OF RECENTLY REVISED QUALIFYING MISDEMEANORS THAT COULD RESULT IN? AN ICE DETAINER. JUST RECENTLY THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL LEARNED OF A TROUBLING PATTERN OF THE ACTIVATIONS OF DISCIPLINE INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS AS SERIOUS AS AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. THIS YEAR'S DEPARTMENT HAS YET TO PROVIDE A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE BASIS FOR THESE THE ACTIVATIONS OR THE POLICY THAT UNDER UNDERLIES THESE ACTIONS. I COULD GO ON BUT I WAS TOLD I ONLY HAVE TWO MINUTES. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT EACH OF THESE INSTANCES SUBPOENA POWER WOULD HAVE HELPED OUR COMMISSION TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER WHICH INCREASES PUBLIC TRUST IN PUBLIC SAFETY. TO BE CLEAR I DON'T BELIEVE THAT SUBPOENA POWER IS A PANACEA I BELIEVE THAT MOST COMMISSIONS WOULD USE IT SPARINGLY AND ONLY WHEN NECESSARY. HOWEVER IT'S AVAILABILITY WILL ENCOURAGE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS WITH OVERSIGHT PANEL TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE AND TIMELY INFORMATION TOOK CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT BODIES WHICH IS OF BENEFIT TO EVERYONE. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB -- ELEVEN EIGHTY FIVE THANK YOU IN BEFORE YOU TAKE THE NEXT WITNESS. THE COMMITTEE OF COURSE APPRECIATES BREVITY BUT I DO NOT HAVE A TWO MINUTE RULE -- BUT WE DO APPRECIATE BREVITY GO AHEAD NEXT WITNESS AND WE HAVE A MOTION. LESLIE CALDWELL -- ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION TO SUPPORT READ THIS BILL -- HI. I AM GOING TO SPEAK A LITTLE MORE BROAD STROKES THAN MY COLLEAGUE -- BUT I HAVE SIMILAR COMMENTS TO MAKE. IF THE ARGUMENT FROM THE OPPOSITION. AND I WILL START WITH THIS IS THAT THE COUNTY BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS ALREADY HAVE THE POWER TO CREATE THESE. I'M SORRY. CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES THEN THERE'S NO REASON FOR THEM TO OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION. AS WE KNOW REGARDING -- THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST SOME ARE GOOD AND SOME ARE NOT. HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY THE COMMUNITY MUST BE ALLOWED TO POLICE THE POLICE. THE ONLY WAY A DEPUTY OR POLICE OFFICER COMPLACENT AREA AND KEEP THE CITIZENS SAFE IS IF THE COMMUNITY LETS THEM [inaudible] TRUSTS THEM. AND PERHAPS EVEN WORKS WITH THEM. WE'RE IN A NEW TIME WHERE THE WORD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NO LONGER TAKEN AS GOSPEL BY THE PUBLIC. NOW IS THE TIME FOR ACCESS ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. THIS BILL JUST IT JUST GIVES THE POWER TO CREATE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES NOT A DIRECTIVE. AND AS WE KNOW FROM OTHER ISSUES EVERY COUNTY WILL SET UP SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER COUNTIES THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT AS TO HOW THE COMMITTEE IS TO WORK. I WANT TO NOTE THAT IN THE AREAS WHERE THERE IS CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT THE SKY HAS NOT FALLEN. IN FACT IN SAN FRANCISCO THE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ASKED BY THE SHERIFF TO TAKE OVER CERTAIN PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC. INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATIONS. IF A COMMITTEE CAN LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT PLACES THAT THINGS CAN GO WRONG IN THE FIELD IN THE JAIL. IN TRANSPORT. THEN THIS COULD ACTUALLY REDUCE LIABILITY FOR COUNTY GOVERNMENTS. THERE ARE JAILS IN THE STATE THAT HAVE DEPLORABLE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS SOME OF HAD TO BE SUED AND EVEN THEN A THIRTIES DRAG THEIR FEET IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUES. A COMMITTEE COULD PERHAPS LOOK INTO THESE PROBLEMS AND SUGGEST CORRECTIONS WHICH WOULD THEN AVOID EXTREMELY COSTLY LITIGATION. WE BELIEVE THE KEY TO THE OBJECTIONS BY THE OPPOSITION IS ACTUALLY THE POWER OF SUBPOENA. I UST NOTE THAT STILL MOST PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED OF TESTING FOR TESTIFYING AGAINST THE POLICE OR DEPUTY SHERIFF'S. I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH AN EXAMPLE OF WHY IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES ALSO HAVE SUBPOENA POWER. A YOUNG MAN WAS STOPPED BY AN OFFICER AND SEARCHED ON HIM WAS FOUND A GLASS PIPE. MATH PIPE CRACK PIPE SORT OF GLASS PIPE THE OFFICER TOOK THE PIPE SMASHED IT ON THE GROUND PICKED UP THE GLASS AND GROUND IT INTO THIS YOUNG MAN'S FACE. SOME HOW THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE GOT WORD OF THE COMPLAINT BUT THIS YOUNG MAN WAS TERRIFIED TO COME IN HE WAS NOT GOING TO TESTIFY AGAINST THIS PERSON WHO HAD DONE THIS TO HIM THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. HOWEVER ALONG WITH THE POWER OF SUBPOENA THAT THAT PARTICULAR COMMITTEE HAD FORTUNATELY IN SOME JOURNAL PROMISES A PROTECTION AS THE YOUNG MAN CAME AND WENT FROM THE HEARING. THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WAS IN FACT HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS ACTION. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT JUST AT THE MIKE. CAT CARRILLO SACRAMENTO CHAPTER OF THE SEAL YOU IN SUPPORT OF THIS NEEDED BILL. RESIDENTS HALLS ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS WE STAND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. RIGHT ANY OTHERS. OKAY WE CAN NEVER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU WANT TO COME TO THE TABLE I THINK THERE'S ROOM SO I DON'T THINK I NEED TO MOVE ANYONE. THANK YOU MANAGER MEMBERS COREY CELLS ALONG BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. ACTUALLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- AS WAS ALLUDED TO BY PRIOR SPEAKERS -- COUNTIES HAVE ALREADY CREATED DIFFERENT MODELS OF CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT. WITHOUT THE NEED FOR SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE AUTHORIZATION. IN THAT REGARD WE BELIEVE THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY. THERE'S ANY QUESTION OR CONFUSION OR CLARITY ABOUT -- SUBPOENA POWER -- IT'S CURRENTLY HELD BY SOME OF THESE OVERSIGHT BODIES -- THERE IS CASE LAW THAT INDICATES CERTAINLY IN CHARTER LAW COUNTIES AS YOUR ANALYSIS -- VERY LOCALLY POINTS OUT THAT THIS IS -- HAS BEEN GRANTED IN% MAY BE GRANTED WITHOUT THAT SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY. ADDITIONALLY THE COUNTY COUNCIL AS WELL AS THE CIVIL GRAND JURY HAS SUBPOENA POWER IF THERE IS SOME QUESTION ABOUT A DOCUMENT OR PERSON -- BEING COMPELLED TO TESTIFY OR DOCUMENT THAT IS SOUGHT -- WITHOUT ANY SORT OF MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT -- INFORMATION IS BEING SOUGHT THAT ISN'T BEING DELIVERED AT THIS POINT -- AND IS THE ANALYSIS NOTES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS SUPERVISION OVER SHERIFF'S -- IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION ABOUT OVERSIGHT OR ACCOUNTABILITY ADDITIONALLY THE BORDER STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS CIVIL GRAND JURIES PROTECTION ADVOCACY AGENCIES INSPECTED OVERSEE SHERIFF OPERATIONS. OF COURSE THIS IS ALL IN ADDITION TO THE OVERSIGHT -- BUT IS PROVIDED BY VOTERS WHO ELECTED SHERIFFS EVERY FOUR YEARS WE CERTAINLY HAVE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS ABOUT -- CIVILIANS ISSUING SUBPOENAS AND AN EXTRA JUDICIAL PROCESS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WITH US FOR A NO VOTE THANK YOU. LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT LET'S SEE IF THERE'S QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MEASURE. I I'VE BEEN KIND OF QUIET THIS MORNING ON MOST OF THE BILLS BUT THIS ONE IS REALLY PIQUED MY INTEREST THAT. THE SOON MCCARTY WHEN I WAS FIRST APPOINTED TO BE TREASURER THE COUNTY OF ORANGE -- AS A RESULT OF REPLACING THE DISGRACED TREASURER WHO PUT ISN'T A CHAPTER NINE BANKRUPTCY I I HAD OVERSIGHT. AND I HAD BOUGHT IT'S I HAD NOT ONE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE I TO AND I HAD MORE THAN TWO OR THREE AND A LOT IT'S GOING THROUGH MY DEPARTMENT AS AS A QUOTE UNQUOTE COUNTY WIDE ELECTED. AND I DIDN'T SEEM TO MIND. OF COURSE I WAS PROBABLY THE MOST AUDIT. TREASURER'S OFFICE IN THE NATION BECAUSE OF THE BANKRUPTCY BUT TIME. AFTER I BECAME SUPERVISOR -- I CERTAINLY HAD DIFFICULTIES WITH MY SHARE. AND I HAD DIFFICULTIES WITH THE CULTURE IN THE JAIL. I HAD -- THIRTY PLUS LAWSUITS COMING OUT OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT -- I FELT THAT THE GRAND JURY WAS LAMP -- IT DID REPORT SAYING AT THE HEAD THEIR REQUIRED TO DO AN ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE IN. AND THEY SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A DEATH IN THE JAIL THAT WAS WELL PUBLICIZED -- SAYING THAT THE SUPERVISORS HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE SHERIFF THROUGH THE BUDGET. THAT'S BOGUS. AS YOU JUST CANNOT CUT PUBLIC SAFETY -- IN THE BUDGET SO I AM I AM TOTALLY SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR CONCEPT. I'M I'M NOT SURE IF I I'M EXCITED ABOUT HOW THE BILL IS WRITTEN [inaudible] I'M. SO WITH THAT -- I'M JUST WONDERING IF OVERSIGHT BOARD THAT ACTUALLY REALLY BEEN EFFECTIVE -- YOU USE A AN OVERSIGHT BOARD IN USE AN INSPECTOR GENERAL. IT WHICH SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE CLOSER TO WHAT I WHAT I WE IMPLEMENTED AN ORANGE COUNTY WHICH WAS AN OFFICE OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND WE MODELED AFTER. MICHAEL URGING NOT GO OUT OF THE LA COUNTY -- AND SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK THE PROFESSOR A FEW QUESTIONS I WROTE DOWN PRISCILLA OCEAN IT'S WHATEVER I HEARD WHAT WAS WHAT IS IS IT AND MY CLOTHES. IT'S CHEN -- SHOP -- CHEN LIKE OCEAN POTION THANK YOU OKAY. I AM. TRYING TO HEAR THE ACTS LIKE LOW JACK ON THE QUESTION SO. LA COUNTY IS JUST HAD AN INCREDIBLE. HISTORY HERE I MEAN MICHAEL CHIU NOT GO WAS SORT OF THE GOLD STANDARD AND THEN YOU HAD UNDER SURE OF TANAKA. THEY JUST DID ALL KINDS OF SAID UNFORTUNATE THINGS AND NOW YOU'VE GOT A FORMER SHERIFF WITH ALZHEIMER'S GOING TO PRISON RIGHT IS IS TERRIBLE. IT'S JUST IT'S JUST IS THAT I WANT GOING ALL THE LET ME BUT BUT WHEN DID. THIS CITIZENS OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. GET FORMED A WE WERE FORMED IN THE AFTERMATH OF A SERIES OF SCANDALS INCLUDING THE ONES THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING -- AFTER A HUNDRED AND SO PAGE REPORT WAS ISSUED BY A COMMISSION ON JAIL VIOLENCE IT RECOMMENDED THE FORMATION OF A CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT PANEL AS WELL AS ACTIVISM FROM. VARIOUS COMMUNITY GROUPS WE WERE FORMED I BELIEVE. WE BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND THE END OF TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN SO WE'VE BEEN. OPERATING FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS WITHOUT A SUBPOENA POWER SO WE ARE ALTHOUGH WE ARE CALLED IN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE I THINK THAT IS AN OVERSTATEMENT WE ARE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE. AND SO THE THE SHOULD NOT GO MODEL -- WAS. WAS ADOPTED BY BY THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND IT WAS HIRED IN IN BED IT WAS SORT OF LIKE YOU HAD SOMEONE INSIDE THE DEPARTMENT THEY COULD. EARNING GARNER THE TRUST OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY REPRESENTATIVES. BUT CAN ALSO ASSIST IN RECOMMENDING -- I DON'T KNOW FOR PUNISHMENT IS THE RIGHT TERM BUT BUT CONSEQUENCES TO CERTAIN ACTIONS AND AND AND THEREFORE FROM THERE JUMP TO HOW DO WE IMPROVE OUR POLICIES PROCEDURES. AND OVERSIGHT SO THAT WE DON'T SEE A REPEAT IS THAT BEING DONE BY THIS OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE IN LA SO WE WE HAVE A OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WHICH IS I THINK SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE REFERENCE AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH -- THE O. I. G.'S SO WE MADE FORWARD REQUESTS IN THE ALL WHITE SHE MAY USE THEIR AUTHORITY TO UNDERTAKE INVESTIGATIONS FOR EXAMPLE OF FOR EXAMPLE DISPROPORTIONATE STOPS OF LATINO MOTORISTS -- ALONG THAT I FIVE CORRIDOR AND THEN FROM THERE WE MIGHT TAKE ACTION AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS WAR -- THE IG FOR EXAMPLE DID INVESTIGATION OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND ICE AND BASED ON AN INVESTIGATION THE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMISSION TOOK ACTION AND MADE A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS SO. WE HAVE A COMPLEMENTARY. RELATIONSHIP WITH THE O. I. G. -- BUT THAT ALL EXIST OUTSIDE OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT -- UNDER OUR FORMER SHERIFF JIM MCDONALD THERE WERE AT CONSTITUTIONAL ADVISORS -- THAT IS A COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY -- POSITION THAT EXISTED WITHIN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WHEN OUR NEW SHERIFF WAS ELECTED. SHERIFF IN A WAIVER -- THOSE ADVISERS WERE -- BREED DIMINISH THEM I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THE STATUS SAID THAT THE TWO THAT WERE THAT IT THAT SERVE THE FORMER SHERIFF WERE DISMISSED -- AND SO THE STATUS OF THOSE CONSTITUTIONAL ADVISERS IS SOMEWHAT UP IN THE AIR AT THIS POINT. FOR WAS IT BUDGETARY BECAUSE THIS NO IT WAS NOT BUDGETARY. BECAUSE FOR THE KIND OF MARKETING WE HAD ESTABLISHED THE DEPARTMENT IS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR. BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUPPORT STAFF AS WELL AND AN ASSISTANT SO YOU JUST MIGHT HAVE A SOMEONE WHO'S THE A I G. U. R. O. I. G.'S GIVES ME WHICH I BUT BUT YOU STILL NEED. SUPPORT STAFF BUT WHAT WHAT IS THE SUPPORT STAFF AT THAT YOU'RE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE HAS A SO WE HAVE AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- AND WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE OR SIX FULL TIME STAFF MEMBERS. A PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICIAL WE HAVE -- STAFF THAT ASSISTANCE WITH RESEARCH AND INVESTIGATION. I WOULD LIKE US TO HAVE A BROADER STAFF IN A BIGGER BUDGET -- TO DO MORE INVESTIGATION TO DO MORE OF A SIGNIFICANT OVERSIGHT OF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN WE'RE IN OUR IN A SORT OF NASCENT STAGES IN TERMS OF OUR DEVELOPMENT MY HOPE OVER TIME THAT THAT THAT WILL EVOLVE. AS TO THE WILL HAVE A STRONGER HAND IN OVERSIGHT -- WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. THE SOONER CARTY HAD A MODEL WHERE THE WHERE THE FIVE SUPERVISORS AND THE SHERIFF TOGETHER. I INTERVIEW IN RICK AND HIRED. THE EITHER THE Y. G. FOR WORK TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY THAT SELECT THE MEMBERS OF THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE SO T'S A TEAM EFFORT. AND NOT A CONFRONTATIONAL -- EFFORT WE DID THAT WHEN OUR NEW SHERIFF ARRIVED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE INCLUDED HER IN OUR INTERVIEW PROCESS OF THE CANDIDATES SO. SO AT ALL WE WERE ALL WORKING TOGETHER BECAUSE PUBLIC SAFETY IS IS OBVIOUSLY THE THE THE TOP PRIORITY FOR ALL OF US -- SO I WITH THAT MR CELLS YELLOW -- WHO? FORGIVE ME FOR MY ISTORY I'VE HAD SOME INCIDENTS WERE THIS GETS. CAN I GET KIND OF WORKED OUT BUT BUT WHEN Y.. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE WHY YOU WOULD HAVE OPPOSITION. IF YOU COULD DO IT IN A COLLABORATIVE FASHION SO THAT IT. BRINGS ABOUT MORE TRUST IN MORE IMPROVEMENT. FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS COUNTY WIDE AND FOR THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I'M. HELP ME OUT JUST. THROUGH THE CHAIR -- ART I'M NOT SURE THAT -- THE MODEL THAT IS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS BILL -- WILL RESULT IN A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH I MEAN IT IT IT CLEARLY WILL BREED TENSION -- BETWEEN THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THE SHERIFF ESPECIALLY IN COUNTIES WHERE THEY HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ISSUES SIMILAR TO THOSE THAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED WHERE. THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS OR YOU KNOW IF IF DOCUMENTS REQUESTED NOT PROVIDED OR IF THERE ARE YOU KNOW QUESTIONABLE PRACTICES THAT. SOMEBODY DEEMS TO REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION OR OVERSIGHT -- IN IT SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE CHALLENGES THAT THIS IS CREATING AN ADVERSARIAL -- SET UP AGAIN BY PUTTING IT IN STATURE BY SORT OF LAYING OUT THE MODEL UNDER WHICH IT HAS TO EXIST -- YOU YOU'RE NOT TAKING AWAY THE FLEXIBILITY BUT YOU'RE CREATING THIS PRESSURE ON A BOARD BECAUSE AND AS A FORMER BOARD MEMBER A SUSPECT YOU KNOW THAT NGUYEN WHEN YOU WHEN THE WHEN THE BORDERS -- POSSESSIVE OF CERTAIN STATUTORY AUTHORITIES YOU'LL ONE LIKELY ARE UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE CONSTITUENTS WHO -- ASK YOU TO EXERCISE THEM AND SO THIS THIS NOTION THAT -- THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT AVAILABILITY OR THAT WE WE NEED THIS TO SORT OF PROMOTED WE THINK IT'S GOING TO WE THINK IT'S GOING TO PROMOTED IN AN ADVERSARIAL WAY TO SAY. YOU NEED TO DO MORE OVERSIGHT OF THE SHERIFF OVERSIGHT OF THE SHERIFF DOES NOT EXIST WHICH WE JUST. DISAGREE THAT THERE'S NOT OVERSIGHT I MEAN I'M AYE AYE MAIMED SEVERAL AGENCIESIS YOU YOU HAD AUDITS AND SHERIFFS HAVE AUDITS AND HEALTH INSPECTIONS AND COUNTY AUDITS AND AND AND WE'RE NOT. CALLING THOSE INTO QUESTION OR DISPUTING BUT AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT IN THIS LEVEL OF MICRO MANAGEMENT AND DOES THAT BEGIN TO STIFLE GOVERNANCE BY ELECTED OFFICIALS [inaudible] ENTER. ON BRIDGES SEE IF THE SENATOR ASK QUESTIONS OKAY AND THEN OF COURSE ABSOLUTELY AND THEN OF COURSE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY YOU MAY RESPOND TO ALL OF THEM AND THEN JUST TO THE PROFESSOR AGAIN -- YOU KNOW I I'VE BEEN ORANGE COUNTY SO I GET TO READ THE LA TIMES TO GET TO WATCH ALL THE FUN THAT'S HAPPENING IN LA. WELL WE WE USE YOUR MODEL -- FOR WITH MEMBER IN THIS REGION OCT ALWAYS IS I STILL THINK IS THE GOLD STANDARD BUT COULD YOU COMMENT ON THE ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP AND AND I KNOW THAT WE'VE GOTTEN A NEW. YOU KNOW A NEW SHERIFF AND AND I DON'T KNOW HIM VERY WELL. MCDONNELL I I KNEW BECAUSE HE WAS AT THE AT THE LONG BEACH POLICE CHIEF. I'LL SPEAK -- TO THE SHERIFF THAT I HAVE THE MOST EXPERIENCE WITH WITH WAS SAID TO MCDONNELL -- WHEN SHARED MCDONNELL -- TOOK OFFICE HE WAS ACTUALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CREATION OF OUR CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT BODY SO THE IDEA THAT -- LAW ENFORCEMENT AND YOU KNOW BOARD SUPERVISORS WOULD NECESSARILY BE AT AT ODDS OVER THE CREATION OF THE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT BODIES I THINK IS BELIED BY OUR EXPERIENCE -- MOREOVER -- WIND WE HAD. ISSUES RELATED TO FOR EXAMPLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH -- TEAMS MET TEAMS WHICH ARE -- TEAMS OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES AND MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN SECOND. BE DISPATCHED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES TO SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH CRISES WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN TO GO TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO SEEK FUNDING. WE WERE COLLABORATIVE WITH THE BORDERS BUT THAT THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO PUT FORTH A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS FAMILIES WHO LOST LOVED ONES EITHER IN THIS IN THE JAILS OR WHO'VE BEEN KILLED BY A SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. I CAN OF THE WITH OUR IMMIGRATION WHEN WE WERE INITIALLY FORMING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PROVIDED AS A SERIES OF LUMINOUS INFORMATION ABOUT -- THEIR PRACTICES INITIALLY AND THEN ONCE WE STARTED TO SEE THAT WE WEREN'T GETTING THE FULL SCOPE -- ONCE SO WHY SHE WAS INVESTIGATING WE STARTED TO ASK WAR WAR AT A QUESTIONS THAT WERE A LITTLE BIT MORE ADVERSARIAL BUT THAT'S ONLY WHEN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WAS IN. PROVIDING COMPLETE TRANSPARENT INFORMATION -- WHEN WE WERE STARTING TO DO MORE INVESTIGATION AROUND CREE AND MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS WE WEREN'T GETTING COMPLETE AND TIMELY INFORMATION SO WE HAD TO PRESS THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT -- IN THE EVENTUALLY STARTED TO GIVE US MORE INFORMATION -- WITH THIS NEW SHERIFF WERE EXPERIENCING -- I'M GONNA TRY TO PUT THIS -- GENTLY WE WE ARE EXPERIENCING A LEVEL OF NON COOPERATION THAT WE DID NOT EXPERIENCE WITH THE PRIOR SHERIFF -- IN SO WE ARE GETTING STONE WALLED IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT ARENAS THAT ARE VERY CRITICAL -- RELATED -- TO RELATED TO DISCIPLINE RELATED TO IMMIGRATION RELATED TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CRITICAL AREAS -- SO I DON'T THINK IT'S OF ANY ONE SIZE FITS ALL IN TERMS OF THIS IS EVER SERIAL OR IT ISN'T I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT -- AND AS I SAID I THINK -- THE EXPERIENCE OF SAYS CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMISSIONS THAT HAVE SUBPOENA POWERS IS AT THE USER'S VERY JUDICIOUSLY THEY USE IT AS A LAST RESORT THEY WOULD RATHER WORK. I'M COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO GET THE INFORMATION THEY'RE ASKING FOR I THINK THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS PREFER THAT AND SO I DON'T THINK IT IS THE CASE THAT -- YOU KNOW WELL AS A CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMISSIONS WOULD YOU SUBPOENA POWERS -- AT THE FIRST INSTANCE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. CERTAINLY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY. YOU MAY HAVE SOME RESPONSES YEAH THOSE ARE. GOOD QUESTIONS BY CENTER MORE LOCK IN AND JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS I THINK YOU GOT MOST OF THE ANSWERS HERE -- THERE THERE ISN'T ONE MODEL THAT OUR BILL IS PROPOSING AND AND DOES AS YOU NOTE IN ORANGE COUNTY THE HAVE INSPECTOR GENERAL POSITION WHICH IS. APPOINTED BY THE BOARD OF SOUPS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SHARE THAT SAME MODEL HERE IN SACRAMENTO. A SOME COUNTIES THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CREATE OVERSIGHT ENTITY AND APPOINT PEOPLE. IN SOME ENTITIES THE VOTERS HAD CREATED ONE ON THEIR OWN. BUT OUR BILL SAYS IS THAT IF ANYONE TO HAVE ANY THESE MODELS OR THE COULD HAVE NOT THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS BUT IF THEY HAVE. THE MALL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ORANGE COUNTY OR IN SACRAMENTO IN LA OR WHEREVER. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE HAVE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT THAT WANTS THAT WON'T STOP THEM. FROM TRYING TO GET INFORMATION WE'VE HAD COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF ALL OF THESE MODELS CREATED IN GOOD FAITH. WANTING TO HAVE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT OVER ENTITY OF GOVERNMENT KNOWING THAT SURE SIR INDEPENDENT ELECTED YOU NOT TRYING. TO TAKE AWAY THEIR JOB BUT THERE IS A ROLL OF OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT. ALLOWING THEM TO DO THEIR JOB TO GATHER INFORMATION AND THEY HAVE BEEN -- STOPPED -- IN IN A FEW THESE INCIDENTS SO AGAIN. THIS IS A LOCAL CONTROL MEASURE ENTITIES COULD AND COUNTIES COULD SAY NO WE DON'T WANT ANY OF THIS OR THEY CAN CHOOSE. THE MODEL THAT YOU TALK ABOUT OR THE MALL WITH LA TALKS ABOUT. THIRD JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SOME OTHER WORDS THE BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE. SAVE US A GROUP OF VOTERS WANTED TO PUT -- EITHER A INSPECTOR GENERAL OR AN OVERSIGHT COMMISSION DON'T HAVE TO DO BOTH. THEY COULD DO ONE OR THE OTHER OR BOTH IT'S THE CHEST BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO JUST ALLOWS FOR IT VERSUS MANDATING IT OKAY -- HARI LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ON THE DÃ­AS -- I APPRECIATE. THE BILL I THINK THAT. THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WE OURSELVES THROUGH STATUTE HAVE EXPANDED THE ROLE OF THE SHERIFF AND I COUNTY JAILS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE GIVEN GIVEN FAR MORE PEOPLE ARE NOW IN CUSTODY AND SUPERVISION. AND WHILE AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT -- SOME SHARE OF DEPARTMENTS MIGHT NOT WELCOME SUCH OVERSIGHT I THINK THAT THE F. THE ABILITY TO FIND TO ALLOW. ENTITIES TO HELP THIS TIME. ABILITY TO DO IT IS IMPORTANT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE IT IT JUST ALLOWS THE ABILITY SO I THINK IT'S A A GOOD PHONE I'M WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. AND THE MOTION IS. TO PASS SO IT DOESN'T GO TO A PERHAPS OKAY -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ASKING RIGHT OKAY. SORRY EXCELLENT LET SAID HAVE A ROLL CALL SKINNER HI THERE I'M MORE LACKEY. MORE LIKE AYE BRADFORD. JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MOREAU. AROUND THAT WIENER. HI I'M THE ROLE STAY OPEN -- X. WE HAVE SOME MISSING MEMBERS BEEN MISTER RECORD YOU HAVEN'T SECOND BILL -- AB TWELVE NINETY SEVEN ITEM. SIXTEEN CAN YOU ADAM ON OR NOT OKAY [inaudible] WHAT ALRIGHT GO AHEAD THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY SECOND BILL HERE IS TWELVE NINETY SEVEN IT'S A NARROW BILL RELATED -- TO CCW PERMITS IT'S FRANKLY ALMOST A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ISSUE NOT LIKE SAFETY ISSUE BUT WE'RE HERE TODAY -- THIS IDEA AND BACKGROUND FOR IT CAME ABOUT A RECENT AUDIT BY OUR STATE AUDITOR RELATED TO A CCW PERMITS. AND THE FEES IN THE STRUCTURE AND THE OVERSIGHT -- I WANT TO AGAIN START OUT BY TALKING ABOUT TO WHAT THIS BILL -- A DOES NOT DO IT DOESN'T CHANGE WHO CAN APPLY FOR CCW AND IT'S THE CW'S THE KANSEN CONCEALED WEAPON PERMIT OF COURSE. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR WHO CAN OBTAIN ONE IT DOESN'T CHANGE WHO CAN ISSUE ONE OR DOESN'T MAKE ANY OTHER. SUBSTITUENTS THE CCW LÃ . IT ONLY REQUIRES THAT FEES CHARGED BY SURE FOR POLICE DEPARTMENT ADEQUATELY COVER THE COST OF SUCH PERMITS. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE FACED HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY -- YEAR AFTER YEAR WERE FACING A DEFICIT OF NEARLY HALF A MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE FEES BECAUSE OF OUR CCW PERMITS -- SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE ISSUED A COUPLE -- HUNDRED A YEAR OUR OUR PRIOR SHERIFF MCGINNIS AND OUT THE RE ISSUING A NEARLY TEN THOUSAND AND SO -- THE FEES HAVEN'T KEPT UP TO THE ADEQUATE COSTS AND THE TAXPAYERS ARE SUBSIDIZING THIS AND SO THIS COMES DOWN. TO LIKE MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT FEES YOU PAY WHEN YOU GET A BUILDING PERMIT OR A MARRIAGE LICENSE YOU KNOW THE FEE SHOULD COVER THE TRUE COST OF THAT OF THAT SERVICE -- IT'S NOT JUST HERE IN SACRAMENTO THE STATE AUDIT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN REVIEWED THE POLICIES OF SACRAMENTO SAN DIEGO AND LA. AND FOUND THAT -- THE THE ACCOUNTING FOR THESE PROGRAMS WEREN'T WEREN'T CLEAR A NOR WAS THERE -- PROPER OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT BAD ACTORS WEREN'T HOLDING CCW SINCE SO IF YOU HAVE ADEQUATE FEES. AND YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT PLEASE DEPARTS INSURANCE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROPERLY INVESTIGATE -- APPLICANTS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN THE HANDS OF THE CORRECT PEOPLE. AND THEN WILL A LASTLY YOU KNOW HALF A MILLION DOLLARS MAY NOT SOUND LIKE A TON OF MONEY HERE BUT THAT'S THREE OR FOUR OFFICERS THAT COULD BE. A SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND OTHER ENTITIES -- WITH THAT I ASK YOUR AYE BUT THIS MORNING AND I HAVE A REPRESENT HIM FROM THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. OFFICE OF PATRICK KENNEDY AND AMEND WILCOX FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE BRADY CAMPAIGN. THANK YOU WITNESSES GO AHEAD THEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED I'M HERE TO READ A STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY SUPERVISOR PATRICK CANDY -- DEAR CHAIR SKINNER AND COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE. I'M FIRMLY SUPPORTIVE OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE NINETY SEVEN MY SUPPORT IS NOT BASED ON MY FEELINGS ABOUT GUNS ARE CONCEALED CARRY WEAPONS PERMITS THEMSELVES BUT ON THE FISCAL IMPACT THIS HAS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. DUE TO THE CURRENT DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CURRENT LAW PROVIDES NO GUIDANCE ON HOW MUCH TO CHARGE FOR AN APPLICATION FEE. THOSE ISSUING CCW PERMITS ARE ALLOWED TO CHARGE FEES THAT ARE INSUFFICIENT FOR COVERING THE COSTS OF ISSUING AND OVERSEEN THESE PERMITS. AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY THIS COST APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER MONEY TO FUND THE LAST FISCAL YEAR WE HAVE THIS DATA. FOR AS I'M SURE YOU ARE WELL AWARE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE STILL RECOVERING FROM THE GREAT RECESSION. AND ARE STRUGGLING WITH A NUMBER OF PRESSING ISSUES SUCH AS HOMELESSNESS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AN AGING INFRASTRUCTURE. IT SHOULD BE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PRIORITY TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THESE ISSUES RATHER THAN SUBSIDIZE THOSE WHO WISH TO OBTAIN A CCW PERMIT. I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL. A GOOD MORNING AGAIN AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF BRADY CALIFORNIA UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE -- BRADY CALIFORNIA IN GENERAL AND THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY CHAPTER IN PARTICULAR. FIND IT TROUBLING THAT UNDER EXISTING LAW THERE IS -- A CAP ON WHAT SHERIFF'S. OR POLICE CHIEFS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES ARE CAN CHARGE. THE FEE THAT THEY CAN CHARGE FOR ISSUING A CCW PERMANENT. WE ARE VERY ALARMED THAT -- IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE FEE DOES NOT COVER THE COST. THAT FUNDS ARE DIVERTED. FROM OTHER LOCAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO SUBSIDIZE THE ISSUANCE ENFORCEMENT OF CCW LICENSES. INNOCENCE ENACTMENT OF PROPS TO THIRTEEN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA HAS OVER TIME ADOPTED A FEE FOR SERVICE -- RECEIVE MODEL AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BASIC SERVICES A FEES LOBBIED FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY TRANSACTION OR APPLICATION TO RECOVER THE COSTS. ARE CARRYING A LOADED HITTING GUN IN PUBLIC IN OUR VIEW IS A PRIVILEGE AND THIS IS SAME STANDARD SHOULD APPLY TO SEE C. W. LICENSE APPLICATION FEE. AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT AFTER A FEE IS ISSUED -- AS WE SAW IN SACRAMENTO WITH THE COUNTY SHERIFF -- HAD TO BE SINCE SOME OF THESE LICENSES THAT PERHAPS INAPPROPRIATELY WERE ISSUED -- THAT OVERSIGHT DOES REQUIRE RESOURCES -- AND AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COST OF ISSUING AN OVERSEEING THE PERMANENT -- IS COVERED BY -- THE PERMIT HOLDER RARE THEN DIVERTING MONEY FROM COUNTY FUNDS TO URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. STE HURRY UP AND COME TO THE MIKE IF YOU'RE COMING OKAY NO ALL RIGHT SO ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND I THINK THERE'S ROOM AT THE TABLE SO YOU CAN STAY AT THE TABLE THERE'S ROOM. FOR WE HAVE A BIG HEARING ROOM TODAY. THAT'S HE SEEMS TO BE ALWAYS THE CASE BUT SUPPOSED TO MAKE US WANT TO GO FAST. MATT RESERVE NEED. I'M SURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD IN READ WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION HERE. IN OPPOSITION TODAY -- AS YOU'RE AWARE WHEN IT COMES TO INSURANCE OF CWC. IS HERE IN CALIFORNIA THEIR STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS IT'S A VERY INVOLVED PROCESS AND IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE. ONE JUST BETWEEN -- THE APPLICATION FEES THE ISSUANCE FEES AND THE FINGERPRINTS YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OVER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN INCLUDE -- THE TRAINING WHICH IS IN THE TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR RANGE -- ADDITIONALLY ARE PERMITS ARE ONLY GOOD FOR TWO YEARS AND THEY HAVE TO BE RENEWED WHICH ALSO COMES AROUND -- YOU KNOW DID THAT'S ANOTHER EXPENDITURE BY BY CITIZENS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORING STATES -- THAT ISSUE PERMITS THEIR THEIR SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THAT AND THE PERMITS OR FOR SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER DURATIONS. AND I THINK THAT IF WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE BUDGET HERE IN THE MONETARY COSTS WILL WE SHOULD REALLY BE LOOKING AT IS EXTENDING THE DURATION. OF CCW PERMITS TO FOR FIVE YEARS LIKE MOST STATES AROUND THE% COUNTRY. CCW PERMITS IT'S NOT THAT YOU GET ISSUE DEPARTMENT AND YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY THESE. A PERMIT HOLDERS ARE MONITORED IN IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS ANY SORT OF VIOLATION. THAT WOULD MAKE THEM INELIGIBLE TO HOLD THAT PERMIT THE PERMIT IS REVOKED. SO WE COULD CUT OUR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN HALF SIMPLY BY DOUBLING THE DURATION OF THE PERMIT. KNOW WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING IS BY REMOVING THE CAP -- WE COULD HAVE A AN INEQUITABLE SYSTEM BEYOND. THE THE FALL TO THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW WITH THE WAY THESE PERMITS CAN BE ISSUE BUT YOU COULD HAVE CERTAIN CHAIRS THAT ARE CHARGING. OR ISSUING AUTHORITIES CHARGING EXORBITANT COSTS FOR THIS AND IT WOULD -- PRICE PEOPLE OUT SO TRULY THESE WOULD BE RESERVE FOR THE ELITE OR THE FAVORED. AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE WANT THAT THIS IS THIS IS. SOMETHING THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A DEMAND FOR IT A DEMAND TO EXERCISE YOUR RIGHTS AND DEFEND YOURSELF IN YOUR FAMILY -- AND SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY ABOUT GOING AND I ABOUT CUTTING OUR COSTS I THINK THAT THIS IS A LOCAL ISSUE IN AS YOU NOTICE THERE'S NO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR ISSUING AUTHORITY HERE. SAYING THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT RECOVERING ENOUGH MONEY IN ISSUING THESE PERMITS -- TODAY SO I THINK THAT IF WE WANT TO LOOK AT THOSE COSTS WOULD LOOK AT EXTENDING THE DURATION RATHER THAN PLACING MORE COSTS ON ON THE PEOPLE THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SEPARATIST REPRESENTING ON WAS CALIFORNIA. AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO TERRIBLE. THE SHERIFF'S OF VERY RECENTLY AS RECENTLY AS THIS MORNING. AND AND THEY THEY POINTED OUT TO ME THAT FIRST THERE ARE. THE RUN THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A PROFITABLE GOVERNMENT SERVICE PROGRAM ALL SERVICES COST MONEY THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. THE AUTHORITIES THAT ARE SPENDING THE MONEY. HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE THE USE IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH ALL OF THE GOALS THAT THEIR ARE REQUIRED TO ACCOMPLISH STATUTORILY -- AND SOMETIMES THAT MEANS AS AS WE KNOWING AND GOVERNMENT I SERVED UNDER TWO GOVERNORS -- AT THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN THE TRADE AND COMMERCE AGENCY AND I SAW HOW IT WAS -- IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO BE. FLEXIBLE IN ORDER TO COVER. PROGRAMS THAT ARE THAT ARE MANDATED -- SOMETIMES MANDATED WITHOUT. A RESOURCES TO TO TO CONDUCT THOSE PROGRAMS -- BUT THE WE DID IT AND AND I THINK THE CHEFS ARE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF THAT. NOW THERE'S A MATTER OF SCALE WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IT'S INTERESTING THAT THEY AUDITED THE SAN DIEGO LOS ANGELES IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. THERE'S AN IN A MATTER OF SCALE IN LOS ANGELES THE ISSUE VIRTUALLY NO PERMITS. THEY ARE EXT GREENLEE RARE. ANY AMOUNT OF STAFF. IT'S A SIGN TO THE C. W. PROGRAM DOWN THERE IS GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH THE ISSUE IS -- IN IN COMPARISON TO TWO STAFF PEOPLE THAT THE PROCESS THEM. IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY EXPENSIVE SAN DIEGO SAME THING ONLY RECENTLY HAVE THEY BEGUN TO ISSUE MORE AND MORE. OF HIM PERMITS HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THEY HAVE ISSUED A LOT MORE PERMITS AND WE KNOW THAT -- THE THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF OF THE SHERIFF AND HIS SPENDING PRACTICES AND HOW HE'S -- THE USING THESE PUBLIC RESOURCES WHEN IN FACT LAST YEAR YOU KNOW HE WAS CRITICIZED FOR FOR BEING FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS OVER BUDGET WITH THIS ISSUE THAT WE BROUGHT. IN THIS THE SHERIFF ACTUALLY RETURN SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS BACK TO THE COUNTY TO BE ABLE TO SPEND ANYWAY THAT THEY WANTED SO HE'S IN A PRETTY GOOD JOB I THINK OF OF MAXIMIZING THE USE OF ALL OF THE RESOURCES IN ORDER. TO ACCOMPLISH ALL OF THE GOALS THAT THE REQUIRED TO DO. THIS. BILL WILL. BOYS GOING TO CREATE SOME ISSUES AND FOR THESE REASONS AND AND WHAT WAS STATED PREVIOUSLY OR IN STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU. LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER -- IN OPPOSITION GO AHEAD REMEMBER CHAIR ROY GRIFFIS SPEAKING ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION WHICH IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS. ALL RIGHT COMMENTS FROM THE GUYS SENATOR JACKSON'S INSIDE LIKE TO ASK WHAT IS SHIPPED -- WHAT IS THE CRITERIA THE BASIS FOR ISSUANCE OF A CONCEALED? WEAPONS KERRY THE FOLKS FROM SACRAMENTO COULD YOU TELL US. WHAT THE CRITERIA ARE WHAT IS THE WORK THAT GOES INTO A DETERMINATION ABOUT THE ISSUANCE OF A PERMIT? THERE'S A CLAIM THAT -- BY THE PROPONENTS SAID -- CCW CARRIERS ARE MONITORED WHAT WHAT IS THE EFFORT WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT YOU MAY RESPOND. I'D HAVE TO GET MORE DETAILS ON THAT I DO KNOW INITIALLY THERE'S A FINGER PRINTING AND A BACKGROUND CHECK AS FAR AS THE ON GOING MONITORING -- I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT I'M NOT pKNOW THERE ARE WERE A FEW TIMES -- THERE WERE REPORTED IN THE NEWS WORK INSTANCES WERE PERMITS OR NOT REVOKED WHEN THEY PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE SO I DO KNOW THAT IS A KURD AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE MIND TURNING IS QUITE WHERE IT SHOULD BE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ENTIRE PROCESS LOOKS LIKE. TO ME ASK ME ASK TO THE CHAIR THE AUTHOR COULD YOU EXPLAIN I MEAN WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF EFFORTS WHEN SOMEONE GOES INTO SEEK A CONCEALED CARRY. PERMIT -- TO THE THEY GIVE YOU THEIR LICENSE TEY WHAT ELSE DO THEY HAVE TO DO HOW IS IT DETERMINED BY A SHARE OF TO ISSUE THESE PERMITS TYSON THERE'S WORK THAT HAS TO GO INTO IT. OR NOT YEAH WELL IT VARIES BY FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THAT'S A BIG DEBATE OR NOT HAVING TODAY. SOME COUNTIES LOS ANGELES. SAN DIEGO YOLO RIGHT HERE YOU HAVE TO SHOW GOOD CAUSE A REASON TO HAVE A YEAR YOU HAVE THAT THAT THE SPOUSE OR DOMESTIC PARTNER WHO HAS THREATENED YOU YOU'RE IN A JOB WHERE YOU. HAVE HAD -- SOMEBODY -- FOR HAVE HAVE FEAR IN YOUR LIFE AND THERE IS THERE IS THAT -- QUANTIFIABLE JUSTIFIABLE REASON OTHER COUNTIES LIKE YOU'RE IN SACRAMENTO REAL COUNTIES IT'S IT'S YOU SHALL IF YOU SHOW UP AND HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE IN A CHECK BOOK AND DON'T HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD AT THE MOMENT. THEY WILL ISSUE A A A A PERMIT TO GET THE LICENSE AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DEBATING ABOUT TODAY I THINK THAT'S A WORTHY DEBATE NO NO AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE REAL COST OF ISSUING A PERMIT THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT IS THE REAL COST? SO IN STATURE WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IS THERE IS A CAP OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS I UNDERSTAND LAST THERE'S OTHER FEES THEY CHARGE THAT THE BACKGROUND CHECKS SO -- I DON'T HAVE. THE EXACT AMOUNT BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS IN IN IN SACRAMENTO WITH THOSE FEES THE GOVERNMENT FEES OR OTHER FEES THAT YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR YOUR YOUR TRAINING ON YOUR OWN ENDS I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT BUT JUST THE COUNTY COSTS. AND BUT WE FOUND HERE IN SACRAMENTO IS THAT WHEN YOU. SPREAD ALL THOSE OUT IT DOESN'T ADEQUATELY COVER THE TRUE COST OF THAT SERVICE. I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE COST REALLY WOULD VARY BY COUNTY I MEAN THERE'S A STATE STANDARD IN TERMS OF THE THE TRAINING THAT'S REQUIRED EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECK. LIVING IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH YOU'RE APPLYING FOR THE PERMIT BUT THEN IT'S REALLY UP TO THE LOCAL LAW FOR CERTAIN THE SHERIFF. TERMLY -- TO DETERMINE THAT THERE IS GOOD CAUSE AND THAT THE PERSONS OF GOOD MORAL CHARACTER AND SOME SHERIFFS AS WAS STATED. BOB DON'T SEEM TO TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY AND ISSUE A PERMIT TO ANYBODY AND OTHERS TO AND OF COURSE THERE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THE VOTERS -- BASED ON THAT POLICY WHAT I FIND ALARMING IN SACRAMENTO IS THE COUNTY SHERIFF SAID HE ISSUES AND QUICKLY AND THEN HE TAKES HIM BACK IT DOESN'T HEAT HESITATE TO REVOKE ON THE REVOKE SOME BECAUSE THE PERSON'S COMMITTED A CRIME. AFTER SOMETHING IS HAPPENING AFTER PERHAPS SOMEONE HAS BEEN HARMED THAT'S THAT'S VERY ALARMING -- AGAIN THAT'S A SEPARATE POLICY ABOUT THE STANDARDS AND AND SHALL ISSUE VERSUS OUR MAY ISSUE THAT -- ACCOUNT THAT A SHERIFF CHOOSES TO FOLLOW BUT THE VERY LEAST THERE SHOULD BE ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THEM -- TO DO THAT OVERSIGHT. BOB REVOKE IT IF NEEDED AND AS YOU HEARD THAT IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY -- THERE WASN'T ENOUGH BASED ON THE FEAR THAT WAS CHARGED IN THE COUNTY THAN ADAM MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. CENTER JACKSON GIVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS NO I I I I GET A SENSE OF NOT CAN I GET WE DON'T HAVE A PRECISE ANSWER BUT I CAN GIVE YOU AN ANSWER MIXXENTM IS ME THROUGH THE CHAIR. MADAM CHAIR HE'D ASKED. FOR THE COUNTY TO RESPOND IN TERMS OF THAT SO I THINK THAT'S ADEQUATE A I AM I'M A CCW INSTRUCTOR AND VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS AND I CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU'LL BERMAN PROCESS IS IN THE COST I THINK WHAT'S BEEN DETERMINED BY THE ANSWER IS THAT THERE'S NOT. PER SE A FIXED COST AND THAT IT IS DEPENDENT ON WHAT THE HOW THE LATE WHAT -- RULE THE COUNTY CHOOSES TO TAKE GIVEN THE AUTHORITY THAT THE STATUTE BUT THE RIVER SLASH. EVERY COUNTY HAS WILL CERTAINLY THERE ARE FIXED COSTSYES BUT THERE CAN BE BROADER BUT I THINK WE'VE SAID ENOUGH AND CENTER JACKSON DO HAVE ENOUGH AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THE COUNTY HAS TO PAY BECAUSE WHAT WERE TRYING TO DO IS FIGURE OUT. HOW MUCH WE'RE THE THE ACTUAL COST IS SO IF WE WERE IF WE WERE HERE IN THE STATE WE'RE GOING TO BE? DOING THIS THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME INDICATION FROM WHATEVER DEPARTMENT WAS BEING ASKED TO IMPLEMENT WHATEVER THE ORDER WAS WHAT THEY ANTICIPATE THE COST WOULD BE AND WHAT THOSE COSTS. ARE RELATED TO THAT LED TO A DO WE NEED MORE PERSONNEL. YEAH I DO. IN OF POLICIES THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE THIS INFORMATION BUT IN THE AUDITOR'S OWN REPORT -- IN THIS IS SPECIFIC TO A COST OF A COUNTY. ACCORD THE SACRAMENTO CCW LICENSING PROGRAM HAS HAD A DEFICIT IN EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS SO THERE EXPENDITURES EXCEEDED THEIR REVENUES AND THEIR REVENUE SERVE COURSE. THIS THIS -- PERMIT COST IN OF FOR THREE YEARS FOURTEEN FIFTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU ARE NUTS IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT I APPRECIATE THAT I'M NOT SO MUCH INTEREST IN WHAT IT COSTS INDIVIDUAL GETTING THE LICENSE BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW. IS THIS IS THE COUNTIES GETTING. REQUIRING THAT THIS BEING A NET ZERO IF YOU WILL -- NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THE MAKING MONEY OFF OF THIS BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS COVERING THE COST TO THE TAXPAYER DOESN'T. HAVE TO COVER THE COST -- IF IF. IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO HAVE A CONCEALED KERRY THAT IS A PRIVILEGE AYE. I WILL CHARACTERIZE WHAT I THINK OF IT BUT IT IS A YA IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO HAVE A COST TO THE COUNTY AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT COST IS -- BECAUSE I I AGREE THAT IF THERE HAS BEEN A DEFICIT THAT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT SEEING THE AMOUNT THAT SHOULD BE. COVERED BUT I WONDER WHAT THE COUNTY. OF SACRAMENTO WOULD CLAIM ITS COSTS ARE PER PERMIT ISSUANCE AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M LOOKING AT AND WHAT AND WHAT THAT'S BASED UPON. YEAH IF I ROUTE I AM SURE HE MORE SKIS ME ROUTE THROUGH THE THROUGH THE CHAIR PLEASE IF YOU HAVE A SPECIFICS OTHER THAN WHAT WE KNOW FROM. THAT YOU'RE. COSTS OF EXCEEDED YOUR REVENUE IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC -- TO WHETHER THERE IS A PRE DETERMINED COST PER ISSUANCE -- I DON'T HAVE THE PRE TERM COST PER ISSUANCE BUT LIKE I CAN ON MY BILL WORK IT OUT. BUT NOT THAT QUICKLY BUT I DO HAVE THE TOTAL STAFFING COSTS -- THAT WE HAD AND THE AMOUNT THAT WE SUBSIDIZED AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN A TOTAL STAFFING COSTS WERE FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND THE DEFICIT THAT THE TAXPAYERS PAID WERE. APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND THANK THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COSTS CENTER MOORLACH THANK YOU MANAGER OF BEING A FORMER COUNTY SUPERVISOR KNOWING THAT. COSTS A TOTAL COMPENSATION OF A DEPUTY SHERIFF -- A PLUS THE OVERHEAD TRYING TO ALLOCATE WHAT DO YOU CHARGE PER CCW -- HUNDRED DOLLARS IS A BARGAIN. SO MISTER A PRESS YOU WERE GOING TO GIVE AN ANSWER MAY MAY I ASK FOR YOU JUST TO FINISH THAT THROUGH THE CHAIR. ARM YOU MAY ASK MISTER PREDECESSOR QUESTION DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC QUESTION TO ASK HIM JUST FINISH. YOU SAID YOU HAD AN ANALYSIS AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO COME EVEN CLOSE TYLER'S. PER PER MINUTE RATE. MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY THE CHAIR YES THE WHEN THEY PROCESS IN IT WHEN EVERY SHARE FOR EVERY CHIEF OF POLICE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ISSUES PERMITS. THEY HAVE THE SAME COSTS. FOR THE FOLLOWING THINGS NUMBER ONE THEY HAVE TO CHECK. THE ALL OF THE FIREARMS THAT ARE LISTED ON PEOPLE CCW TO CHECK THAT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THERE'S A COST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THAT THEIR CHARGE AND THAT COST. BERRIES A LITTLE BIT THEN THEY ARE EACH OF THESE AGENCIES ARE CHARGED PER PER MINUTE -- FOR THE ACTUAL BACKGROUND CHECK THAT IS CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DOESN'T CONDUCT THESE VERY QUICKLY YOU CAN HIRE PEOPLE AND HAVE THEM ON BOARD AND THEN YOU PAY I'M OFF UNTIL THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE COMPLETES ITS. ITS ITS BACKGROUND CHECK AND THEN SUBMITTED FOR THE THE THE DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE. TO TO THE PROCESS OF TYPING UP. THE THE PERMIT TAKING THE PHOTOGRAPH IT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO -- AND AND HAVING THE APPOINTMENT FOR THE PERSON TO COME IN AND TEN AND RECEIVE THAT THING SO THERE ARE DEFINITELY FIX COSTS THAT ARE THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY AND IT IS NOWHERE NEAR HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND IT'S THE COST OF A OF AN X. ENHANCE BACKGROUND CHECK. A COST FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF ALL OF THE FIREARMS THAT ARE LISTED THE PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE -- BE ABLE TO CARRY THEIR CHECKED TO SEE THEIR STOLEN. THE CHECK TO SEE IF THEY'RE REGISTERED TO THE PERSON WHO'S YOUR QUESTION THE SIX W.. AND THAT INFORMATION IS THEN SHARED WITH THE WITH THE SHERIFF FOR THE CHIEF OF POLICE AND WHICH POINT THEY DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE GOING -- TO PROCEED WITH ISSUE IN THAT THAT LICENSE -- THE COST IS IS THOSE ARE THE FIXED COST OF THE ACTUAL PROCESS OF DELIVERING A CCW -- TO TO A OF CUT NAPA CAN'T IT WHICH TOTALS. AB AND REYES AND WHICH TOTALS -- IT DOES VERY DEPENDING THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE HAS THE ABILITY TO CHARGE A DIFFERENT AMOUNTS BUT IT'S HALF OF THE HUNDRED DOLLARS -- THE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE. TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A STAFF TIME IN THE OVERHEAD WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE WHAT THE WHAT THE THE SHERIFF IS. KILLED BY THE BY THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE FOR PROCESSING THE PERMIT THE OTHER EXPENSES YET MAYBE REMEMBER. YOUR GOOD SAMPLE -- THE SERMON PARTY -- I JUST A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS WHEN I I GULAR FRUSTRATED WHEN THERE'S A CAP. INSIDE STATE CODE LIMITING WHAT COUNTIES CAN CHARGE OR MAYBE IT'S TOO HIGH MAY WAS TOO LOW. I'VE SEEN IT BOTH WAYS -- SO I YOU KNOW THIS GOES BACK TO PENAL CODE TWENTY SIX ONE NINETY B.. AND IT'S AT LEAST FROM MY RESEARCH FROM THE MATERIAL I HAVEN'T SO AT LEAST OVER TEN YEARS. OLD SO YOU'RE WILLING HAVE AN INFLATION FACTOR HERE -- SO. I'M JUST WONDERING WHY YOU WANT TO REMOVE THE CAP AS OPPOSED TO MAYBE JUST RAISING THE CAP AND DOING IT MAYBE OVER A GRADUATED. PHASED IN PERIOD OF TIME. I GUESS IT BOILS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT SOME COUNTIES LIKE SACRAMENTO WHERE THERE'S OVER A MILLION PEOPLE. THE ISSUE THEY HAVE TEN THOUSAND PERMITS SOME COUNTY LIKE LA EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE THEY ISSUE A COUPLE HUNDRED SO IT ADDED IT'S IT'S BASED UPON. YOU KNOW THEIR WORKLOAD AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE. AND I GUESS WE COULD PUT A CALL IN THERE PUT INDEX TO IT BUT I THINK THE BIGGER QUESTION IS THAT -- SHOULD BE BASED UPON YOUR YOUR COUNTY AND HAVE A TRUE RECOVERY MODEL. AS IS THE EARLIER BY WITNESS AFTER PROP THIRTEEN THAT BECAME THE BASIS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR WRONG OR RIGHT. THAT IT'S IT'S A COST RECOVERY FOR THE SERVICES AND AS THE AND ARE A WITNESS TESTIFIED -- THESE THINGS DO COST MONEY AND IT'S NOT DIRT THERE IT'S A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS LITERALLY AND IF THEY CAN IF IN IT IF INCREASE FOR TRUE COST BASED UPON THE BACK OF THE ENVELOPE. IT WOULDN'T QUITE DOUBLES SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR SOMEONE TO GET A CCW PERMIT WOULD BE. INCREMENTALLY MORE BUT IF IT TAKES THAT THE BIGGER QUESTIONS WHO SHOULD PAY THE DIFFERENCE SHOULD BE THE PERSON GETTING THE PRIVILEGE OF THAT PERMIT. FOR THE GENERAL TAXPAYER AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE WITH THE BATES ALL ABOUT HERE TODAY PERHAPS I'M. WHY NOT HAVE AN INITIAL FEE? AND THEN A VERY LOW RENEWAL FEE WHERE NO WORK IS DONE OTHER THAN YOU'RE JUST [inaudible] RE UPPING. LIKE A TWO TWO TWO STAGE PROGRAM WHICH WAS ONE I DISAGREE WHEN I DID WAS JUST TAKE MAKE THE PERMIT NOT ONE YEAR BUT MAKE IT FOR YOU KNOW MAKE IT FOR YEARS. AND THEN YOU'D YOU'D HAVE ONE SHOT EVERY FOUR YEARS. BUT HOW ABOUT THE FIRST INITIAL APPROVAL IS ONE FEE AND THEN. JUST SITTING IN A RENEWAL ANNUALLY THAT SHOULD BE A LOT LESS CORRECT YOU CAN RESPOND SURE THAT THE THE RENEWAL THING EVERY FOUR YEARS I THINK IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA LET ME TELL YOU WHY THERE IS AN INDIVIDUAL. ACROSS THE STREET THE CAPITAL WHO HAD AN ARSENAL OF FIREARMS AND HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION. AND SOMEHOW THE HOUSEKEEPING AND SERVANT AT SERVICE INDIVIDUAL WALKED IN AND DISCOVERED ALL THIS AND CALLED HER MANAGER. AND THEY CALL THE SACK WHEN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IT COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON THEY THEY FOUND THE GUY WHO IS HAVING -- SOME TYPE OF MENTAL BREAKDOWN. TWENTY MILES SOUTH OF HERE THEY CONTACTED HIM AND GOT HIM SOMEHOW CAJOLED INTO CERTAIN AREA WITH HIS FAMILY. AND HE SAID THAT HE WANTED TO CREATE HARM TO GOVERNMENT HE WAS ESSENTIALLY GONNA HAVE AN ASSAULT RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE CAPITOL WHICH IS IS RIPPED OUT THE HEADLINES. AND SO. THESE THINGS OUGHT TO BE RENEWED ON A ANNUAL BASIS AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE FRANKLY I THINK HAVING A PROPER A FEE STRUCTURE TO DO BACKGROUND CHECKS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T GET HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE PROBABLY LIKE OUR WITNESSES THAT ARE. LAWFUL CCW HOLDERS WHO PROBABLY HAVE NO PROBLEM HAVING -- A WEAPON BUT OTHER INDIVIDUALS WE GOT WE GOT TO DO MORE -- BACKGROUND CHECKS TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S SAFE. DOES THIS PERSON A CCW HOLDERS YES HE WAS OKAY LAST QUESTION MADAM CHAIR RIGHT ARM. WHY YOUR YOUR BILL MAKES THIS A REQUIREMENT WHY NOT OPTIONAL BECAUSE ASSURE OCCURS HAS? AS A BUDGET AND CAN. IN A SENSE FOR THE BUDGET SUBSIDIZE SOME OF THESE COSTS THAT IS THAT'S A CHOICE AT THAT DEPARTMENT IT HAS -- SO I'M I'M WONDERING WHY YOU'RE MAKING IT A REQUIREMENT. WELL IT'S IT'S A CHOICE NOT JUST OF THE SHARE THAT'S A CHOICE OF THE CITIZENRY SO YOU'RE IN SCRAMENTO WE HAVE. OVER A MILLION PEOPLE WHO DO NOT. ABBAS CCW LICENSE ANY CHOOSE NOT TO DO SO THERE ARE THE RIGHTS OF THE TEN THOUSAND THE HABS HAVE SOME THAT'S THE CURRENT LAW. BUT BUT WHY SHOULD WE BE SUBSIDIZING. THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THAT'S THE QUESTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. EARNED BY WILL JUST NOTE ON THAT THAT IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WAS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MANDATE. THIS BAG IN FACT -- TO DO WHAT -- THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS DOING IN THIS BILL. NOW OF COURSE THAT IS JUST A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE AUDITOR BUT IT WAS IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE DÃ­AS. ALL RIGHT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MAY CLOSE. I THANK YOU I I APPRECIATE THE THE ROBUST DEBATE I I DID WANT TO NOTE THAT I WAS HERE THREE YEARS AGO. WITH THE SAME BILL IN IT WAS VETOED AND ARE THEN GOVERNOR ASKED A QUESTION. I'M NOT SURE THIS IS A ONE OFF JUST HERE AT SAT COUNTY. SO I I YOU KNOW TOOK THE VIEW AT HAND AND SAID OKAY FAIR QUESTION SO NEXT YEAR I WENT AND ASK FOR STATE AUDITOR TO EVALUATE. WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A PROBLEM JUST IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY OR ACROSS CALIFORNIA. SO SHE DID A A ROBUST AUDITS LOOKED AT SEVERAL COUNTIES AND CAME BACK WITH THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH I'M HERE WITH TODAY. SO THIS IS BASED UPON A SOUND RESEARCH STATEWIDE AND OUR LOCAL EXAMPLE AND ASK THE RIGHT. THANK YOU. HI I THINK WE ALREADY HAD A MOTION. OKAY -- THEN. SEEING NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WILL TAKE A ROLL. MOTIONS TO PASS TO THE FLOOR SKINNER HI. I'M MOORLACH. MORE LIKE NOW BRADFORD FIVE BRADFORD AYE JACKSON MITCHELL HI MITCHELL I'M AROUND [inaudible] WIENER. ALRIGHT WE'LL KEEP AN ON CALL AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A RECESS SO WE WON'T OPEN THE ROLE FOR THOSE TIMES. BILLS THAT ARE STILL IN CALL TILL AFTER. WE RECONVENE WE WILL RECONVENE IN ROOM THREE ONE NINE ONE AT ONE THIRTY AND AT THAT POINT THE FIRST BILL WE HERE. WE WILL HEAR. IS ITEM THIRTEEN AB ELEVEN TWENTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY BECAUSE HE HAS AN OBLIGATION. SO WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THAT FIRST AND THEN WE'LL GO BACK TO FILE ORDER AND THAT IS ROOM THREE ONE NINE ONE ONE THIRTY WITH THAT. WE ARE RECESSED IF YOUR AND WITNESSES ARE HERE. OKAY THEN -- PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE IS NOW. COMING RETURNING FROM RECESS I KNOW THAT I HAVE MEMBERS ON THEIR WAY -- AND WE OF PROMISED ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY THAT WE WOULD START WITH YOUR BILL SO. WHEN YOU GO AHEAD AND BEGIN? VERY GOOD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU. AND I WANT TO SAY THIS IS A BILL THAT DEALS WITH ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS. BUT ANIMALS AREN'T THE ONLY THINGS THAT MOVING CHANGE AND MOVE ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE VERY ENVIRONMENT WHICH WERE RENDON AYE NOTE -- TO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. BECAUSE OF THINGS WERE HAPPENING ON THE WEST. I'M IN THE OCEAN ON THE WEST COAST OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE SEEING MORE. WHETHER IT'S A WHALE IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY. SIXTY LINES ARE THINGS APPROACHING THE COAST. WHERE SHE'S SEEN SERVICE ANSWER BRING PEOPLE IN CONTACT WITH ANIMALS IN SETTINGS WE DON'T? TYPICALLY EXPECT. WE HAVE WE'VE HAD DROUGHT WHICH BRINGS ANIMALS OUT AT NIGHT IN IN THE MORNING SEARCHING FOR WATER. INTO URBANIZED AREAS I LIVE LONG AMERICAN PARKWAY AND WE SEE. GREATER INFLUX OF COYOTES OTHER SORTS OF THINGS REPORTS OF OUTLINES. URBAN INTERFACE THE FIRES. PEOPLE IN. AND THEN WE'VE AUTHORIZED HAVING PEOPLE IN THEIR BACKYARDS DEGROOT. RAISE CHICKENS OF DAYS WHICH ALSO ATTRACT. ANIMALS IN THE COMMUNITY. SO THERE'S A LOT OF CHANGE GOING ON THAT END I THINK INFLUENCES JUST THE NATURAL WORLD AROUND US AND ANIMALS THAT SORT OF THING. THIS BILL DEALS A CERTIFIED ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS. ARMED [inaudible] YET. THEIR FUNCTION IS TO PROMOTE THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF ANIMALS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE HUMANS AND NO SAME COMMITTEES THAT'S THEIR SPECIALTY. AND THERE IS JUST A NEED FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE PROFESSIONAL DEAL WITH ALL MANNER OF ANIMALS AND ENTER INTO OUR COMMUNITY. WELL SOME ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS HAVE SPECIALIZED TRAINING THAT HAS NOT ACTUALLY BEEN THE NORM IN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE KIND OF FALL INTO THESE ROLES. ARM AND SO TRAINING STANDARDS CAN VERY COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY COUNTY BY COUNTY. SO THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK TO WHICH ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS. I MAY RECEIVE STATE RECOGNIZED CERTIFICATION IF THEY SO CHOOSE. SO IT'S NOT A HEAVY HANDED APPROACH BUT IT DOES SORT OF RAISED TO PROFESSIONAL BAR. ON FOLKS WHO WANNA GAUGES TYPE WORK. IT WILL FOSTER GREATER UNIFORMITY PROFESSIONALISM. AND IT WILL HELP LOCAL AGENCIES IDENTIFY PEOPLE THAT THEY WANT. TO PUT IN THESE POSITIONS IN ADVANCE. LET'S PEOPLE SHOWCASE. THEIR COMMITMENT TO PROFESSIONALISM. SO I HAVE YOUR TO TESTIFY IN RE. PRESENT SKI LET'S SAVE CHAIR THE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL WELFARE ASSOCIATION A LESSON TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS THE CHAIR. AND THERE [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PUBLIC SAFETY MY NAME IS HANNAH BURZYNSKI. AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL WELFARE ASSOCIATION ALSO KNOWS CAL ANIMALS. OF ALL FROM THE RECENT MERGER OF THE CALIFORNIA WILL CONTROL DIRECTORS A FORTY YEAR OLD ORGANIZATION. AND STATE HUMANE ASSOCIATION WHICH IS OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD. EXCUSE ME OUR STATE WHY GROUP REPRESENTS BOTH GOVERNMENTAL AND NON PROFIT ANIMAL SERVICES AGENCIES. OUR ASSOCIATION IS A SPONSOR OF AB. ELEVEN TWENTY FIVE AS YOU SOMEONE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY SAID THE TRAININGS VOLUNTEERING BILL IS PATTERNED AFTER THE CODE ENFORCEMENT NON MANDATORY CERTIFICATION PREVIOUSLY PASSED BY YOUR LEGISLATURE. MARIN HUMANE SOCIETY CURRENTLY HAS A BASIC ANIMAL CONTROL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACADEMY. AND THAT'S BEEN SPONSORED BY THE SANTA ROSA PUBLIC SAFETY CENTER FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS THERE'S ANOTHER ACADEMY IN SAN DIEGO. WE NEED TO INCREASE THE PROFESSIONALISM PANEL CONTROL OFFICERS IS LONG OVERDUE. A WORD I HATE TO SPEAK BUT THE DOG CATCHER DAYS ARE LONG GONE -- ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER STATEWIDE INVESTIGATE A MULTITUDE OF ANIMAL WARDENS VIOLATIONS AND CRIMES AND LONG SIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT. HEY CIOS INVESTIGATE ANIMAL FIGHTING RINGS. PREPARE AND EXECUTE SEARCH WARRANTS FOR ANIMAL ABUSE INVESTIGATIONS AND SEES DANGEROUS DOGS AS WELL AS ISSUE CITATIONS. CURRENTLY HUMANE OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH EXTENSIVE TRAINING SPONSORED BY COUNTING MILES BUT ARE A CEOS AND NOT CALIFORNIA IS THE LEADER IN ANIMAL WELFARE. AND I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I MOVED HERE FROM THE EAST COAST ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO TODAY CIOS DIDN'T HAVE A PATH FOR TRAINING AS OTHER SOUTHEASTERN STATES DID. ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS ARE PROFESSIONALS PLEASE GIVE THEM A PATH TO BE CERTIFIED. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHERILUS BUT ESPINOZA HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU [inaudible] ANY OTHERS. ALL RIGHT LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THE RIGHT SEEING NINE I HAVE NO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR WHICH TO ASK FOR A ANY. YEAH NO NO WORRIES I JUST DON'T THERE'S NO IN HORSESHOE -- IT. QUESTION BUT I THINK OR MAKE A MOTION -- BUT WE WILL GET THEM AND MY RECOMMENDATION ON THE BILL WAS -- SUPPORT TO AND IT WOULD IN THE MOTION WOULD BE DO YOU PASS TO BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SO I'M GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE I REQUEST IN WRITING TO GET AIR SUPPORT EXPLOSION OF JUST WATCH THE HEARING TODAY. SINCERELY BUT I KNOW YOU HAD SEVERAL GOOD CONVERSATION. IT'S ALL GOOD WELL I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION. AND I KNOW THAT THE STAFF OF MY OTHER MEMBERS WHO ARE EITHER IN OTHER COMMITTEES OR STILL AM SPRING FINISHING OUR CAUCUS DISCUSSION. ARE MONITORING SO THAT THEY CAN UPDATE BUT THERE MEMBERS -- BUT I'M SURE AS SOON AS I GET SOME MEMBERS BACK IT WILL BE A MOTION ON YOUR BILL. OKAY THANK CHAIRMAN SPENDING SO MUCH AND WILL GO TO YOU ALL TO THE NEXT ITEM. WHICH IS ITEM FOR A. B. SIX OH SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO GOODAFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB. SIX OH SEVEN A MODEST BUT IMPORTANT TO REFORM TO WORK KERN SENTENCING AND ADDITIONAL PRACTICES. FOR CERTAIN NON SERIOUS AND NON VIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS JUDGES. TO EVALUATE ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE AND APPLY THEIR DISCRETION IN SENTENCING. INSTEAD JUDGES ARE FORCED TO SHARE AND IN CARS TO CHARGE AND INCARCERATE PEOPLE. WHO WOULD BE BETTER TREATED UNSUPERVISED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES UNDER PROBATION? SB SIX OR SEVEN ALLOWS JUDGES TO USED TO THEIR DISCRETION TO ORDER PROBATION SERVICES FOR OFFENSES THAT CURRENTLY MANDATE INCARCERATION IN COUNTY JAILS OR STATE PRISONS. THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE SENTENCING STRUCTURE OR AFFECT MAXIMUM SENTENCES. UNDER AB SIX OH SEVEN JUDGES WILL STILL CHOOSE TO CAN'T MAY STILL CHOOSE TO SEND INDIVIDUALS TO PRISON OR JAIL. BUT ALLOWS A JUDGE TO WEIGH THE FACTS AND USE OTHER AVENUES TO ACHIEVE JUSTICE. BEIJING PROVIDE SERVICES SUCH AS EFFECTIVE DRUG TREATMENTS THAT MAY NOT. COUNTY JAILS JUST LAST YEAR CONGRESS PASSED AND THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE FIRST STEP BACK. INCLUDING AN EXPANSION OF COURT DISCRETION FROM MANDATORY MINIMUMS. AND A REDUCTION IN SENTENCES FOR DRUG OFFENSES AB SIX OF SEVEN IS CONTINUING THE NATIONAL DISCUSSION. AROUND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE OVER SENTENCING AND MASS INCARCERATION I'LL LET MY WITNESSES HERE IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. THANK YOU WHICHEVER. ONE OF YOU WANT TO START GO AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS HARLON GROSSMAN I'M A RETIRED JUDGE FROM CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. I RETIRED SEVEN YEARS AGO AFTER TWENTY ONE YEARS OF JUDICIAL SERVICE. I WAS A PROSECUTOR FOR NINE YEARS BEFORE I BECAME A JUDGE. MY RETIREMENT COINCIDED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB ONE OH NINE CRIMINAL JUSTICE. PUBLIC SAFETY REALIGNMENT. SINCE RETIRING I'VE BEEN ACTIVE IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY ADVOCACY. I'M PRESENT THE SAP. KATE IN FAVOR OF AB SIX OR SEVEN WHICH WOULD REPEAL THE PROBATION AN ELIGIBILITY. AND THE BARD A SUSPENSION OF SENTENCES PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN CERTAIN ENUMERATED NON VIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES. THEREBY RESTORING JUDICIAL DISCRETION TO IMPOSE APPROPRIATE SENSES. TAILORED TO THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH DEFENDANT THAT COMES BEFORE THE COURT. RESTRICTIONS ON JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN SENTENCING DO NOT SERVE AS A DETERRENT TO CRIME. RATHER THEY ONLY SERVE TO LIMIT THE DISCRETION AND TIE THE HANDS OF JUDGES. INVOLVED IN THE ADJUDICATION DISPOSITION AND RESOLUTION OF THESE CASES. IT MAKES LITTLE SENSE TO LIMIT JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN THE SUN SEEN OF THESE MATTERS WHEN JUDGES RETAIN AN EXERCISE THEIR DISCRETION. I'M MUCH WEIGHTIER ISSUES SUCH AS WHETHER TO IMPOSE THE DEATH PENALTY WHETHER TO STRIKE A STRIKE CONVICTION. WHETHER CASE SHOULD PROCEED IN JUVENILE COURT RATHER THAN CRIMINAL OR ADULT. WHEN IT COMES TO SENTENCING CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH? MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES ARE NOT EFFECTIVE IN ANYWAY INCLUDING AN INCLUDING NOT BEING COST EFFECTIVE. AN ACTING AB SIX OH SEVEN WILL PERMIT MORE EFFECTIVE. DEFENDANT BASED SENTENCING AND A PERMIT MORE EFFICIENT USE OF CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE RESOURCES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS LESLIE CALDWELL FORMER PUBLIC DEFENDER OF SOLANO COUNTY AND I HAVE BEEN REALLY FORTY YEARS -- IN THE PRACTICING INDIGENT DEFENSE. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL FOR C. PDA. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW BUT NOT REQUIRE THE COURT TO GIVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S CURRENTLY AN ELIGIBLE UNDER THE LAW.

THREE OF DRUG ADDICTION AND DRUG CONVICTIONS THE JUDGE AGREED THAT SHE SHOULD BE IN REHABILITATION. AMY WAS MOTIVATED TO GO AND TRULY WORK TO FREE YOURSELF OF THE ADDICTION.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE NINETY SIX WOULD ESTABLISH THE TAX RECOVERY IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY -- CRIME ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR THE PURPOSES OF COMBAT IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. EVERY DAY THE UNDERGROUND COMIC TAKES A TOLL IN SOME THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY WORKERS ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO LOW WAGES AND LACK BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS CONSUMERS EXPOSED TO DANGEROUS PRODUCTS THAT ARE. BE HARMFUL TO THE HEALTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL. BUSINESS IS AN ATTEMPT TO PLAY BY THE RULES ARE UNDER CUT AND PUT AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE AND LTIMATELY TAXPAYERS ARE LEFT SUBSIDIZING ILLEGAL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES THAT FAILED TO PROVIDE BASIC WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS. AB TWENTY SIX WOULD STRENGTHEN STATE EFFORTS TO COMBAT COMBAT THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY BY STAB MACHINE A MULTI AGENCY COLLABORATION LED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THROUGH MULTI AGENCY APPROACH OUR STATE AGENCIES WILL BE ABLE TO PULL RESOURCES. USE THE RESPECTIVE EXPERTISE TO PROSECUTE THOSE THAT PREY ON THE MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS IN AVOID PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE INTACT. I HAVE -- THE WITNESS WITH ME AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. RIGHT AFTER YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S MARIO DIBERNARDO AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HEALTHCARE BUT SERRA WHO'S. VERY PLATT PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE THE BILL. CODIFIES AND STRENGTHENS A MULTI AGENCY COLLABORATION THAT IS FOCUSED ON CRACKING DOWN ON THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY FROM A TAX PERSPECTIVE.

THEY WORK TOGETHER THE POOL THEIR RESOURCES THEY ACT OUT WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. TO FILE CRIMINAL COMPLAINTS AGAINST AGREE JUST TELLING LEVEL CRIMES. THIS PROVIDES BENEFITS TO BUSINESSES AS A CREATES -- EVIL EVEN PLAYING FIELD OUR PROVIDES PROTECTIONS TO LABOR -- WHO EXPERIENCE ENVIRONMENT ARE I'M SORRY -- EMPLOYMENT AND CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THROUGH THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY AND PROVIDES PROTECTION TO CONSUMERS. WHERE ARE THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY HAS COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN HARMFUL? AND IT BRINGS SIGNIFICANCE TAX REVENUE BACK TO THE STATE BECAUSE THIS ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE THINGS ABOUT THIS PROGRAM.

IN THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTING. AND NOW WE WILL MOVE TO MS FRIEDMAN. THE ITEM SEVENTEEN AB FORTINO. SEVEN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. CLOSE DRIVING AND STREET RACING ARE HUGE ISSUE ACROSS THE STATE. IN LOS ANGELES -- WHERE I AM HONORED TO REPRESENT A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE WE HAVE BEEN SEEING DEATHS FROM STREET RACING ON AN INCREASING AN ON GOING BASIS? AND RECKLESS DRIVING IS ONE OF THE TOP CONCERNS OF MY DISTRICT -- PEOPLE TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE CONSTANTLY. NOW WE KNOW THAT ANYBODY CAN MAKE A MISTAKE ONCE. BUT IF YOU ARE DRIVING WITH SUCH AND WANTON DISREGARD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND WELL BEING THERE HAS TO BE A REPORT -- RECKLESS DRIVING TO REMIND ALL OF YOU I AND ANYONE WATCHING IS NOT JUST ROLLING A STOP SIGN IT'S NOT MAKING A RIGHT TURN. ON A RED TO QUICKLY RECKLESS DRIVING IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE TO MISDEMEANOR. AND IT IS DRIVING WITH SUCH AN EGREGIOUS LACK OF RESPECT FOR OTHER PEOPLE ON THE ROAD THAT YOU WERE CREATING. THE HAZARD. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT WAS DEVELOPED WITH THE CONSULTATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO SAYS THAT THE FINES THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS AND THE PENALTIES ARE NOT TO TURN PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING MONEY? STREET RACING. WHAT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO FOLKS IS HAVING THEIR CAR TAKEN AWAY FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME? AND ALSO RIGHT NOW IN THE LAW THERE'S NOTHING THAT REQUIRES LEGAL MODIFICATIONS THAT ARE MADE TO SEE STREET RACING VEHICLES TO BE REMOVED PRIOR TO THAT CAR BEING RELEASED FROM IMPOUND. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SAYS THAT ON YOUR SECOND CONVICTION FOR STREET RACING OR RECKLESS DRIVING YOUR CAR WILL BE IMPOUNDED FOR THIRTY DAYS NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF OFF RAMPS? IN THE CASE OF HARDSHIP IF THE CASE THAT IT'S A A CHILD WHO BORROWED THE CAR BUT THEY'RE NOT THE PRIMARY USER IF YOU NEED THE VEHICLE TO GET TO A JOB THERE'S A LOT OF OFF RAMPS TO MAKE THIS DURABLE AND NOT OVERLY. PUNITIVE. BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT FOR THOSE WHO ARE WHOSE LIVES ARE PUT AT RISK AND SOMETIMES TAKEN BECAUSE OF RECKLESS DRIVERS AND SERIAL RECKLESS DRIVERS. THEY ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO SAFE STREETS THEY ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO NOT BE MOWED DOWN IN A CROSSWALK OR IN A SIDE IN THE SIDEWALK. WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN LOS ANGELES HAS NOT BEEN WORKING WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN THESE TYPE OF EVENTS UNFORTUNATELY? WE THINK THAT THIS BILL IS A SENSIBLE AND BALANCED A SOLUTION. I'M I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE ANYBODY HERE. TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THIS BOY. ANYBODY HERE WHO IS THE WITNESS NO WE HAVE NO WITNESSES BUT I WILL SAY THAT I'M THIS BILL GOT OUT I THINK. PRETTY MUCH UNANIMOUSLY -- LAST YEAR I IT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR -- AND WE WOULD RESPECT OF RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ONCE AGAIN THAT YOU ON A SUPPORT THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SORRY WITNESS GO AHEAD YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. WITH REGARD TO IMPOUNDMENT THIS BILL DOES ONE THING. IT DENIES JUDGES THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THEIR DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE LENGTH OF TIME OF IMPOUNDMENT. CURRENT LAW IN ALLOWS IMPOUNDMENT OF THE VEHICLE USED IN RECKLESS DRIVING OR IN A SPEED CONTEST FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO THIRTY DAYS. AB FORTINO SEVEN NEEDLESSLY REMOVES THE COURT'S DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PERIOD OF EMPOWERMENT AND WOULD INSTEAD REQUIRE IMPOUNDMENT BIRTH FULL THIRTY DAYS. OR ANY SECOND OFFENSE OF RECKLESS DRIVING OR STREET RACING. EMPOWERMENT OF THE VEHICLE PARTICULARLY FOR A PERIOD AS LONG AS THIRTY DAYS ALL TOO OFTEN BECOMES A DE FACTO FORFEITURE. AS MANY DEFENDANTS ARE UNABLE TO PAY THE LARGE STORAGE FEES CHARGED WHEN A VEHICLE IS HELD FOR THAT LONG. EARLIER THIS YEAR THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY PUBLISHED A REPORT ENTITLED TOWED INTO DEBT. ON THE DEVASTATING EFFECT TO THE VEHICLE PUT TOES AND IMPOUNDS CAN HAVE ON INDIVIDUALS. THAT REPORT FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE STORAGE FEE IS FIFTY THREE DOLLARS PER DAY. WITH ADMINISTRATIVE AND TOWING FEES THIS MEANS THE TOTAL COST OF A THIRTY DAY IMPOUNDMENT WILL BE ON AVERAGE ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE DOLLARS. AN AMOUNT MANY DEFENDANTS SIMPLY WON'T BE ABLE TO PAY. FOR MANY OR MOST OF THOSE SUBJECT TO THE MANDATORY THIRTY DAY IMPOUNDMENT THE RESULT WILL BE THE LOSS OF THEIR CAR. LOSS OF THE OF THE VEHICLE WEATHER FOR THIRTY DAYS OR AS THE CASE MAY WELL BE PERMANENTLY. CAN RESULT IN THE DEFENDANT LOSING A JOB OR BEING UNABLE TO FULFIL FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES. WELL THE JUDGE ALLOWS THE IT WHILE THE BILL ALLOWS THE JUDGE SOME DISCRETION WHEN IMPOUNDMENT WILL RESULT IN HARDSHIP FOR THE FAMILY IT DOES NOT ALLOW THE JUDGE TO CONSIDER HARDSHIP TO THE DEFENDANT ON OR WHETHER THE DEFENDANT WILL BE ABLE. TO WHAT BOARD TO GET THE CAR BACK AFTER THIRTY DAY IMPOUNDMENT. JUDGES SHOULD RETAIN WRIST DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PENALTY IN EACH CASE INCLUDING WHETHER AND FOR HOW LONG TO IMPOUND THE VEHICLE. UP TO THIRTY DAYS. THE RIGHT CHANNEL. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NOTE. I DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. REAL SACRAMENTO CHAPTER OF IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. RIGHT WE HAVE A COMMON SERVER -- CONCERNS QUESTIONS BY OUR GO AHEAD SENATOR RIGHT YOU CAN MANAGE YOUR AN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR -- I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE CHALLENGES OF STREET RACING IN AN EXHIBITION OF SPEED AND AND WE TURN ON THE TV OPEN UP THE NEWSPAPER ALMOST ON A WEEKLY BASIS WHERE WE SEE SOMEONE. THAT WAS STRUCK BY A CAR I THINK JUST LAST WEEK IN LOS ANGELES A NINETY TWO YEAR OLD INDIVIDUAL. WAS STRUCK AND KILLED BUT I GUESS MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT THE THE THE LAW ALREADY PERMITS FOR THE EMPOWERMENT OF THE BILL VEHICLES SO. WEISS IS MAJOR NECESSARY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR I'M WE HAVE -- IT DONE RESEARCH AND BILL THIS THAT PENALTY IS ALMOST NEVER GIVEN. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING AND SAID AS WERE CUT WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE GUIDANCE THE JUDGES SAYING THAT THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE AND IF THERE IS AN ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. IF THERE ARE HARD HARDSHIPS THEY HAVE THE DISCRETION TO REDUCE THE IN HOME IN ORDER TO WEIGH THE COMPLETELY SO WE'RE STILL GIVING THEM QUITE A LOT OF DISCRETION. AND AS MUCH AS I HATE TO DISAGREE WITH MY FRIENDS OF THE SEAL YOU BECAUSE I TEND TO BE ON THEIR SIDE ALMOST ALL THE TIME. I ALSO. THINK THAT SOMEBODY WHO'S COMMITTED THIS OF TWICE. NEEDS SOME TYPE OF SOMETHING THAT'S NOT BEING DONE NOW UNDER THE LAW. AND I BELIEVE ALSO THAT PEDESTRIANS IN LOS ANGELES AND CYCLISTS HAVE RIGHTS. TO AND WE ARE AND DRIVING IS A PRIVILEGE IT'S NOT A RIGHT. AND IF YOU'RE DRIVING A CAR RECKLESSLY TO THE EXTENT TO WHERE IT'S A CRIMINAL. CONVICTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT JUST YOUR A SLOPPY DRIVER BUT YOU'RE ACTUALLY ACTING IN A CRIMINAL NATURE AND YOU DO IT TWICE. THE NOT PRIVILEGE SHOULD BE REVOED FOR PURITY OF TIME I THINK THAT THAT IS IS REASONABLE. AND YOU KNOW YOU ARE YOU HAVE TURNED. THE VEHICLE INTO A WEAPON AT THAT POINT. SO I I THINK THAT YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING HASN'T BEEN WORKING AND IF YOU DO KNOW THAT AS YOU JUST POINTED OUT. A SO IT'S STILL EARLY WE ARE SEEING THESE TYPES OF DEATHS INCREASE. SO WE DIDN'T WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND WE I'VE WORKED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THEY SAY LISTEN THIS WHEN SOMEONE'S MAKING MONEY. ST EXHIBITIONS WHAT BAKER ABOUT IS LOSING THAT THAT SOURCE OF EXTRA INCOME. AND ALSO HAVING TO REMOVE THOSE MODIFICATIONS SO I THINK THAT WE SHOULD GIVE THIS A TRY BECAUSE I'M AFRAID TO LET MY DAUGHTER WALKED ON THE STREET RIGHT NOW IN LOS ANGELES. AND I GET THOSE CONCERNS BECAUSE I TO SEE A I SEE. LEAVING THE HOUSE IN THE MORNING WERE FOLKS HAVE DONE DONUTS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION AT TWO AM IN THE MORNING AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT ARE -- A REAL HAZARD TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. WHY NOT HAVE SOMEONE? ARRESTED FOR THIRTY I RATHER SEE HIM ARRESTED I THINK THAT'S MORE OF A DETERRENT BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE YOU AND POUND THE CAR DOESN'T MEAN THEY WON'T GET SOMEONE ELSE'S CAR AND AND STILL DO THE SAME BAD BEHAVIOR. IF THE ACLU WOULD AGREE TO THAT YOU KNOW IN MY CONSIDER REMINDING WELL I I I WOULD RATHER SEE HIM ARRESTED FOR THIRTY DAYS IF YOU'VE BEEN CONVICTED TWICE. EXHIBITION OF SPEED AND RECKLESS DRIVING [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. DO YOU HAVE A MOTION NOW. THIS ONE IS. OKAY EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS LAST TIME. SESSION WHEN WE APPROVED IN AND ARE THEN GOVERNOR HAD VETOED. ONE THIS BILL ONCE BUT A SIMILAR BILL THE PREVIOUS TIME SO THERE'S TWO VETOES ON IT. AND I FIND IT'S WHAT'S ALSO RIGHT INTERESTING IS THAT WE'VE JUST RECENTLY. I'M PASSED OUT WHAT LEASE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. SOME I AM. AT LEAST ONE BILL OF NOT MORE THAN. ONE AND I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENT ONE IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT WOULD. I PUT LIMITS ON TOWING. AND WE'RE RECOGNIZING THAT. IT'S NOT IN ALL CASES BY ANY MEANS BUT THAT. YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE YOUR BILL TOWED IF YOU'RE LOW INCOME. THERE'S CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE YOU KNOW A BILL OF VEHICLE IMPOUNDED. OR TOWED [inaudible] AND AND THEN. THE THE IMPACT IS THAT MUCH MORE SEVERE. BECAUSE OF THE COST TO THE INDIVIDUAL. BECAUSE OF THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THEIR ABILITY TO GO TO WORK IN SUCH. WERE. THE CARS THEIR LIVELIHOOD. SO THESE ARE TRICKY SO I I UNDERSTAND YOUR OBJECTIVES. AND I DID SUPPORT THE BILL LAST YEAR -- AT VARIETY. IT. IT'S THE I'M NOT SURE IT'LL BE A DETERRENT. I'M IN FACT I'M PRETTY POSITIVE IT'S NOT GONNA BE A DETERRENT NOW. WHETHER IT. IT WOULD TEMPORARILY STOPPED. IF THE FOR THOSE WHO GET IMPOUNDED YEAH WOULD TEMPORARILY STOP THEM FROM WHATEVER THEY'RE ENGAGED IN. WHETHER IT OVERALL STOP THE DANGEROUS TO RECKLESS DRIVING SO THESE ARE THE TRICKY THINGS AND I I WOULD NOT NECESSARILY IMPOSING A MEMBER RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK. IT'S WORTH CONSIDERING WHETHER IT'S THE HIGHER NUMBER OF INCIDENTS TO BE A REQUIRED IMPOUNDMENT OF THIRTY DAYS AND I THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS WORTH CONSIDERING. TO BALANCE THE OBJECTIVE YOU HAVE IN. THE KNOWING WHO IS LIKELY. TO BE IMPACTED BY IT. BUT GO AHEAD ALL TO SAY THAT. ONE OF THE REASONS DEVELOP THE BILL THE WE DID WE WE DID BECAUSE IN MY DISTRICT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING A LOT OF THESE HIGH FINES ARE ACTUALLY NOT LOW INCOME PEOPLE THEIR HIGH INCOME PEOPLE. THERE ARE THE CHILDREN OF HIGH INCOME PEOPLE AND WHAT THE POLICE WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT IS THAT THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM PAYING THE THOUSAND DOLLAR FINES OVER AND OVER AGAIN THEY'RE GIVING THE SAME FINE TO THE SAME YOUNG PEOPLE. WHO ARE COMMITTING A LOT OF THESE OFFENSES AND THERE ARE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF DISPOSABLE WELL? THEY'RE ABLE TO PAY IT. I'M SO IT'S SIR IT'S A AND I'M NOT TRYING TO ARGUE THAT THERE AREN'T DISPROPORTIONAL THESE OF OF PENALTIES IN A LOT OF PLACES. MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THIS ISSUE AND IN MY DISTRICT HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF THE OPPOSITE WE DEVELOP THIS BECAUSE WE'VE. THE MONETARY FINE WAS NOT REALLY AFFECTING THIS GROUP OF A POPULATION OF IS COMMITTING A LOT OF THIS PARTICULAR CRIME BUT THE TAKING THE CAR AWAY WAS A VERY BIG DISINCENTIVE FOR THEM. BECAUSE THAT CAR IS IS A STATUS SYMBOL IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM AND ALSO THE ABILITY THAT FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. TO HAVE  LEGAL MODIFICATIONS HAVE TO BE REMOVED BEFORE THE CAR COMES BACK THAT DOESN'T EXIST ANYWHERE NOW IN LAW. SO IN TERMS OF THE STREET RACING VEHICLES THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING A VEHICLE THAT'S BEEN TRICKED OUT TO GO THREE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR WHATEVER THEY DO. AND YOU'RE HAVING IT TURN BACK INTO A CAR THAT'S JUST A NORMAL CAR. SO THIS I THINK THAT IT'S WORTH TRYING THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE TO WHOM THE FINE DOESN'T MATTER AND BECAUSE THE BILL STILL HAS THAT OUT FOR PEOPLE TO WHERE IT'S A HARDSHIP. ON I THINK THAT. IN SOME WAYS I'D SAY THAT THIS IS FLIPPING THAT AROUND AND GETTING PEOPLE. I'M IN A DIFFERENT WAY TO YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE THE PRESSURE POINT OF MAYBE NOT ENGAGING IN THIS BEHAVIOR IF THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE THE VEHICLE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM EVEN FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME SURE. HE WON A CLOSE SOURCE THAT IS YOUR CLOTHES. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW I VOTED FOR THE BILL THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE TOWING BILL BECAUSE TO ME THAT THIS NO IT'S PUNITIVE FOR SOMEONE WHO'S JUST NOT PAYING THE BILL. INCREASE THAT DEBT BUT AGAIN THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING SOMETHING THAT WHICH IS A PRIVILEGE WHICH IS DRIVING. AND NOT JUST ONCE BUT TWICE NOW -- DRIVING IN A WAY THAT IS TURNING THAT VEHICLE INTO A WEAPON AND WE DO NEED TO USE ALL THOSE TOOLS BECAUSE THE SAFETY OF PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS HAS TO COME FIRST AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THAT IN CURRENT LAW WE'RE NOT MAKING IT. WE'RE NOT BEING SERIOUS ENOUGH. A TO MAKE IT. OUT TO MAKE THAT PRIORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND BECAUSE IT'S THE SECOND CONVICT I FEEL LIKE YOU JUST NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEND A STRONG MESSAGE. SO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE SENATORS IDEA OF INCARCERATING TO FOLKS AND THIS YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE SAW. YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR RESIDENTS. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION. I'M LET'S DO A ROLL CALL. QUESTION IS THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. HI. I'M MORE LIKE [inaudible] BRADFORD. JACK BEEN. MITCHELL MORALE [inaudible] I WIENER. ARE YOUR BILLS ON CALL GIVEN THE WE'LL SEE THOSE APPS OF MEN MEMBERS AT SOME POINT. OKAY. I SEE THAT WE'VE GOT OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW HERE. WE WELCOME YOU. AND THIS IS ITEM EIGHTEEN A. B. FIFTEEN OR WHAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME PERCENT A. B. FIFTEEN A ONE WHICH YOU SAW THIS LAST YEAR AND RECEIVE BIPARTISAN UNANIMOUS SUPPORT. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE AGAIN THIS IS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN SOLVE APPROPRIATE -- FIRE ARM. CIRCUMSTANCES IT USING FAR ARMS IN CASES OF CONNECTIVE ITTY UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY AND RESPECT THE ASCARI VOTE WITH ME IN SUPPORT ALSO IS REPRESENTED FROM OUR OWN COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. DISCOUNT GREAT BEFORE OUR WITNESS IN SUPPORT. SINCE YOU MENTIONED THAT A BILL WOULD ALREADY GONE THROUGH THAT WE ALL SUPPORTED. COULD YOU JUST QUICKLY DESCRIBE SINCE IT WE HAVE BEEN -- HAD BILLS BEFORE IS THAT WE ALSO HAVE TEAMED BEFORE DID I THINK THERE IS A CHANGE. IN THIS ONE COMPARED TO THE BILL THAT WAS BEFORE US LAST YEAR. YOU BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THAT YES -- THE BILL THAT WE HAVE A FORCE IS -- HELPING THE BEEN THE UTILIZATION OF NINE BEEN THAT TECHNOLOGY THAT WE ALREADY HAVE AN EXISTENCE -- BUT WE DO NOT HAVE A STANDARD FOR YEARS YEAH JURISDICTIONS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO UTILIZED AND LO THESE BALLISTICS IMAGES -- YOU WHEN USED IN CASES OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY WE HAVE COUNTIES -- SIMILAR TO SANTA CLARA COUNTY THAT HAVE UTILIZED THIS TECHNOLOGY HAVE SOLVED SIGNIFICANT A CRIMES BECAUSE OF THIS. AND SO THIS IS WHAT WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH -- THIS WAS -- THIS WAS HELD IN THAT SENATE APPROPRIATIONS TO THE FISCAL COST -- BUT WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN CONTINUE ON THIS EFFORT AND ADDRESS THESE. OUTSTANDING ISSUES A MOVING FORWARD -- SO AGAIN THIS IS A VERY THIS YEAR WE HAD CONRAD IS THAT YOU WERE THAT THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES COULD CONTRACT WITH OTHER. OF COURSE YES ON BECAUSE OF THE FISCAL COSTS DOWN ON THE MANDATE SO WE WANT TO PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY -- FOR LOCALITIES TO A STILL UTILIZE THAT TECHNOLOGIES BUT IN A MANNER THAT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM. GREAT THAT'S WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS YEAR'S YES TO MAKE YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION OKAY. SO YES PLEASE WITNESS PERCY. MARIA SOME ACCOUNT FROM THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND IN MY CURRENT ASSIGNMENT I OVERSEE OUR COUNTIES CRIME STRATEGIES UNIT IN ASSOCIATION WITH OUR LOCAL. POLICE AGENCIES AND I RUN A LARGE CRIME THAT INTELLIGENCE CENTER REALLY THE BECAUSE OF OUR COUNTIES EFFORT IS A REDUCTION IN GUN VIOLENCE THAT IS EVIDENCE BASED. USING A PROVEN METHOD THAT IS A NATIONAL DATABASE OF BALLISTIC IMAGES. THIS EVEN THE OPPONENTS TO THIS BILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY THAT COMPARES EXPENDED SHELL CASINGS FROM SHOOTINGS WORKS IT SOLVES DRAMATIC CRIMES IN OUR JURISDICTION WE MOVED TO A UNIVERSAL USE OF THIS TOOL IT DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF NINE IN LEEDS AND HAD. GOT INCLUDING SOLVING NINE MURDERS IN A SINGLE YEAR WHICH FOR OUR JURISDICTION IS A LOT WE ONLY ABOUT THIRTY MURDERS A YEAR. IT WAS A BIG DEAL. BUT SINCE I CAME HERE LAST YEAR I THINK ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF THE BILL LAST YEAR -- WAS TO REALLY TWO FOLD ONE WAS THE FACT THAT IT'S A MANDATE AND THE SECOND WAS THE FACT THAT IT'S COSTLY -- IT IS OUR POSITION THAT -- TO TO URBAN CENTERS WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING DAILY TRAGEDY AND BLOOD SHED AT THE HANDS OF GUNS IT IS WELL WORTH THE EXPENDITURE TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN AUGMENT AND UNIVERSALLY SUBMIT THIS EVIDENCE. AND IS WELL WORTH THE COST I THINK THAT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS BILL IS IT PRINT BRINGS THIS TECHNOLOGY TO OUR SMALL OR RURAL AREAS THAT MAY NOT IMMEDIATELY HAVE ACCESS. TO A LOCAL LAB SO REALLY -- BUTTRESSES THE ABILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO PROVIDE THIS TO OUR NON URBAN CENTERS BUT IN OUR LARGEST POPULATION BASES THERE ARE ALREADY USING THIS TECHNOLOGY. ISSUES ARE NOT USING IT UNIVERSALLY IS THE REASON IT'S A MANDATE IS BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T MAKE THEM DO IT. THEY WON'T. AND SO SINCE I CAME HERE LAST YEAR AND TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS BODY WE'VE HAD TWO MURDERS WHERE IT LITERALLY ARMOR WEAPON WAS SITTING ON TESTED ON A SHELF. AND WE FOUND IT AND WE GOT IT TESTED THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN OTHER JURISDICTIONS DON'T HAVE THE SAME URGENCY WITH A RECOVERED WEAPON. AS YOU DO IN YOUR MURDER INVESTIGATION THAT'S WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR IT TO BE A MANDATORY IS SOLVES CASES IT LITERALLY PUT SHOOTERS WHO HAVE USED A GUN BY DEFINITION MORE THAN ONCE BEHIND BARS AND SOLVE THESE CASES. IMPORTANTLY -- I THINK IT BRINGS THIS TECHNOLOGY TO PARTS OF THE STATE THAT OTHERWISE WOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO ITS WITH IT'S WELL WORTH THE COST OR TO SAVE THE LIVES. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT SO IT SAM SEE IF THERE'S WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK WE HAVE ENOUGH ROOM AT THE TABLE YOU WANT TO COME OVER HERE BECAUSE THE THERE'S A MIKE THERE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ISHA MUCH THERE HERE ON BEHALF OF THAT CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CRIME LAB DIRECTORS. AS MENTIONED BEFORE AT THIS BILL DID COME BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE LAST YEAR AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN IN COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. I'LL WELL WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT -- THAT CHANGE IN CURRENT BILL IS AN IMPROVEMENT UPON LAST YEAR'S BILL THAT WAS HELD IN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. I'M STILL -- AND THIS IS I UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT THE FISCAL COMMITTEE BUT STILL HAVING TO CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER JURISDICTION THAT HAS ACCESS TO THIS TECHNOLOGY. STILL COSTS MONEY AND THIS IS AN UNFUNDED MANDATE SO -- BUT WE OPPOSE ON BACKGROUND BUT ALSO -- ADDRESSING ON THAT -- PROPONENTS OF THE BILL WE ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESIDENT OF LEGISLATIVE MANDATES GOVERNING AND THE NATURE IN WHICH LONG FORSMAN INVESTING INVESTIGATIONS UNDER OUR UNDERTAKEN. AND MANY TYPES OF EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION ARE ROUTINELY GATHERED IN THE COURSE OF AN INVESTIGATION. AND TRADE INVESTIGATOR SHOULD HAVE THE DISCRETION TO PROCESS THAT EVIDENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INDIVIDUAL SITUATION. AND WITH THE BENEFIT OF EXPERIENCE EXPERTISE AND TRAINING THAT IS CORNERSTONE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSION I'M SO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. SO I EVER. QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION TO YOU OPEN THAT IT WAS PRIMARILY THE COST BUT THEN YOU WENT ON TO THAT THE REAL IT -- OF REAL. ADDITIONAL IN SUBSTANTIVE OBJECTION IS THAT. BY INDICATING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY SHOULD UTILIZE THIS TECHNOLOGY BUT I THINK PRIMARILY WHAT I SEE IS THE BENEFIT OF THE BILL. UTILIZING THE NETWORK. THAT YOU DEBT. YOUR SHERIFF'S AND THEY CRAM CRIME LABS OPPOSE. HAVING A HAVING THE LEGISLATURE SAY USE THIS NETWORK IN THIS TECHNOLOGY. RIGHT I MEAN WE WE WE DON'T WANT TO TO OBVIOUSLY BE AGAIN IS NOT A COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH IT SHOULD NOT BE A MANDATE ALLEGES AND I LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. TO BE TOLD HOW THEY ARE TO INVESTIGATE A PARTICULAR CRIME AND WE FEEL THAT THIS BILL DOES THAT. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO MANDATE TO US THAT WE OUGHT TO DO THIS. AND THERE'S THAT COST PER HEAD ON NARAL WERE. WE CAN DISCUSS RIGHT SO. I'M. I HADN'T REALLY. MADE THIS ANALOGY LAST YEAR AND BUT IN THE PRESENTATION TODAY. BUT WELL THESE ARE NOT THE SAME. ARE CASTING ARE REQUIRING. OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO CAST. THE EVIDENCE FROM THE SEXUAL ASSAULT. TEST THE THAT WHICH THEY GATHER. AND GETTING IT INTO THE NATIONAL DATABASE. WAS GREATLY RESISTED FIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. AND AND WE WERE IS THE LEGISLATURE TOLL THAT WE YOU KNOW WE WE DON'T KNOW BEST. WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW BEST TRUE BUT THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE INDICATING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT HOW TO DO THEIR INVESTIGATORY JOBS AND YET EVERY. BIT OF RESEARCH AND DATA AND AND REAL LIFE. EXPERIENCES SHOW THAT THOSE AGENCIES THAT FULLY. TEST ALL OF THEIR SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE. HAVE A MUCH HIGHER. ARREST RATE IN CONVICTION RATE. ON SEXUAL ASSAULT. SO IF THIS TECHNOLOGY GIVES US A CLOSER WHEN IT COMES. TO GUN VIOLENCE INCIDENTS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SHOULD WELCOME IT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COME IN OR NOT [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] A ANYWAY. IS THERE A MOTION OR SHOULD WE ALLOW ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW TO CLOSE. ALL RIGHT SO WE HAVE A MOTION ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW WOULD YOU LIKE. TO MADAM CHAIR YOU ELOQUENTLY SUMMARIZE THE IMPORTANT UTILIZATION OF THIS. THIS TOOL THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO ALL OF US. AT THE COST WILL DEAL WITH BUT I WOULD SUGGEST AGAIN WE WILL NOT REALIZE THE RESULTS IMMEDIATELY BUT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. OUT WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. FAMILIES WILL FIND SOME CLARITY AS TO HOW WE CAN ADDRESS MANY OF THESE ISSUES MOVE BOARD AS THEY ARE INTER CONNECTED. US SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND RESPECTFULLY ASK BACK I'M. LET'S DO A ROLL CALL ON THE MOTION IT IS. AB FIFTY NO ONE DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS ROLL CALL SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE MOORLACH. BRADFORD. BUT I JACKSON [inaudible] MITCHELL MORALE [inaudible] WIENER. ALL RIGHT SO THE BILLS ON CALL. AND THE SHEET YOUR PRESENTATION YOUR RE VISITED AS SOON AS WE HAVE MEMBERS. AND WELL LET'S GO TO OUR FINAL BILL -- ITEM TWENTY AB. SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO. OVER 99% OF VEHICLES SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES CURRENTLY ARE QUIPPED WITH THE EVENT DATA RECORDERS. THESE ARE DEVICES SIMILAR TO THE BLACK BOX AN AIRCRAFT. THAT RECORD A NARROW SET OF PARAMETERS JUST BEFORE AND AFTER AN ACCIDENT THINGS LIKE THE POSITION OF THE STEERING WHEEL THE POSITION OF THE OF THE ACCELERATOR THE BRAKE PEDAL THE PERFORMANCE OF THE AIR BAGS AND THE SEAT BELTS. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THESE. ITEMS ARE VERY USEFUL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN INVESTIGATING AN ACCIDENT. ARE. THE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION EITHER REQUIRES A COURT ORDER IN THE CASE OF A FELONY OR INFORMED CONSENT ON THE A IN THE CASE OF THE DRIVER HOWEVER LAW ENFORCEMENT IS FACED WITH AN OBSTACLE WHEN. VEHICLES -- ACCIDENTS INCLUDE SERIOUS BODILY INJURY OR DEATH THERE'S NO ONE TO GIVE THAT INFORMED CONSENT. THIS BILL CREATES A VERY NARROWLY CRAFTED. AVENUE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION BY NARROWLY CRAFTED I MEAN. A VERY LIMITED WINDOW OF INFORMATION FIVE SECONDS BEFORE TO ONE SECOND AFTER AN ACCIDENT. A VERY NARROW LIMITED OF PARAMETERS SO THIS ISN'T A FISHING EXPEDITION TO GO BACK TO THE HISTORY OF WHERE THE CAR IS BOUND. IT'S ONLY WITH THE COURT A COURT ORDER AND THE PERMISSION OF THE JUDGE SO THEY HAVE TO CONVINCE THE COURT THAT THIS IS THE CASE. NUMBER TODAY I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THE AMENDMENT OFFERED IN YOUR ANALYSIS THAT LIMITS THIS ONLY TO MISDEMEANOR CASES AND END NOT INFRACTIONS. SO I JUST AND IS VERY NARROWLY LIMITED SERVICE SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCES WE'RE GIVING LAW ENFORCEMENT THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED. TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSES OF THESE ACCIDENTS WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE [inaudible] I LIKE. BOTH TAKE MOTION NUMBER LET'S SEE. M. YOU HAVE A WITNESS IN SUPPORT GREAT A TEAR FROM YOUR WHAT. AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I AM SAN DIEGO COUNTY DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY JOHN. I'M HERE ON TODAY ON ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER STEP AND STRONG SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL. SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. I'VE BEEN A DEPUTY DA FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS I'VE PROSECUTED MANY VEHICULAR CRIMES INCLUDING VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WOULD BE A GREAT BENEFIT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE INDICATED AND AND ET OUR AS OFTEN. ASSOCIATED WITH THE BLACK BOXES IN THERE THEY'RE NOT THE SAME BUT THEY WORK THE SAME OVERALL IN THE CENTER OF PROVIDING INVESTIGATORS. WITH TECHNICAL INFORMATION AFTER CRASH. INVESTIGATORS CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT. VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO QUIT THEIR VEHICLES BUT MOST OF THEM DO AN INCREDIBLY LARGE NUMBER OF DO. A LARGE NUMBER DO TODAY. BUT THOSE MANUFACTURERS WHO DO CHOOSE TO THEIR VEHICLES WITH DDR ARE REQUIRED BY THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRANSPORTATION SAFETY ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS FEDERAL REGULATIONS WHICH STANDARDIZE THE ET ARE AND STANDARDIZED. B. E. R. CAPTURES THE TECHNICAL DATA FOR THE FIVE SECONDS BEFORE UP TO THE ONE SECOND AFTER THE CRASH. PRACTICALLY SPEAKING IF THERE IS NO CRASH SEVERE ENOUGH TO RESULT AN AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT OR NEAR DEPLOYMENT THERE IS NO DATE. YOU PLUG INTO AN EASY ARE THERE'S NOTHING THAT. A TRAINED EXPERT CAN UTILIZE EQUIPMENT TO PLUG INTO THE VEHICLE RETRIEVE THE EDR DATA AND USE IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AND WITNESS STATEMENTS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY. ET OURS ARE BY DESIGN ASSOCIATED WITH VEHICLES AIRBAG SYSTEM AND THE SEAT BELT PRE TENSIONER PRE TENSIONERS. OR SOMETHING USING OUT THERE WITH SOME PEOPLE ABOUT WITH WHAT ET OURS AND ET ARE ARE NOT. ET OURS AS DEFINED. ARE NOT. INTO TELEMATICS INFOTAINMENT EDIE OURS DO NOT HAVE VIDEO CAMERAS. AUDIO RECORDERS THEY DON'T TELL ANYTHING ABOUT IT OFTEN CELL PHONE USE IN A VEHICLE THINGS LIKE THAT IT'S TECHNICAL DATA INVOLVING RASHES. AIR BAGS AND SEAT BELT PRE TENSIONER. ONE FOUR MINUTES PASSED BY LAW WITH CONDUCTING A THOROUGH PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATION. WHENEVER THERE'S A CRASH THEY RESULT IN DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY TO THE CITIZENS WHETHER IT'S THE DRIVER WHOSE OWN FAULT ACOSTA BASH. FOR AN ISN'T PERCENT. ROADWAYS TO BE SHUT DOWN FOR HOURS FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED. AND ON LAW ENFORCEMENT GET THE TRUTH AND FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED. IN THE SERIOUS PRACTICE EDR DATA IS THE NECESSARY THANKS FOR LAUNCH. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT IMAGINE THIS SCENARIO WELL OF COURSE BEEN ARRIVED ON THE SCENE THERE ARE TWO CARS CRASH. WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE HAPPENED BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT SURE THAT ONE VEHICLE TURN LEFT IN FRONT OF AN ONCOMING BE A? BUT THEY'RE NOT SURE THE DRIVER ONE VEHICLE IS DEAD THE DRIVER OF THE OTHER VEHICLE IS ON IN THAT SITUATION LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD NEED AND WANT ET OUR DATA. UNDER CURRENT LAW THEY CANNOT GET IT. WITH AB SIXTEEN THIRTY AS AMENDED THEY COULD SEE. ORDER ME A SEARCH WARRANT TO GET INFORMATION THAT IS VITALLY NEEDED. LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD STILL NEED TO BUY WITH HELP WHEN YOU SEE A LOT. AND ULTIMATELY A JUDGE WOULD BE THE ONE THAT SIDE WITH THE WARRANT SHOULD ISSUE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE OUR DATA FROM A FROM A FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL STANDPOINT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW IS NOT. CONSIDERED PRIVATE WHEN THINGS LIKE SPEED BREAKING AND THE LIGHT AND VEHICLE MOVEMENT ARE EXPOSED TO THE PUBLIC WHEN SOMEONE DRIVES ON A ROAD THAT PERCENT. OVERSEAS YES. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AT HAND IT'S BREAKS A REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN STATUTORY PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS. AND HOW IMPORTANT INFORMATION IS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TO SOCIETY WHEN SOMEONE IS DEAD OR SERIOUSLY BODILY INJURED IN A RACK. I'M ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK. THANK YOU LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THERE'S ROOM RIGHT THERE. GOOD AFTERNOON CATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF DHL YOU OF CALIFORNIA -- WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT WE APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TAKING BE -- SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE INFRACTIONS FROM THE BILL BUT WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED. CALIFORNIA LAWN SEARCH WARRANTS BOUNCES TO IMPORTANT INTERESTS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BE PROTECTED FROM UNREASONABLE GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT SEARCHES AND SEIZURES. AND THE NEED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE CRIMES. ONE WAY THAT OUR LAW DOES THIS IS BY SETTING A GENERAL RULE THAT A WARRANT CAN BE SOUGHT WHEN THE EVIDENCE TO BE SEIZE. IS EVIDENCE OF A FELONY THERE IS NO GENERAL PROVISION ALLOWING ISSUANCE OF A SEARCH WARRANT WHERE THE THING TO BE SEIZED AS EVIDENCE OF A LESSER CRIME. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WOULD ALLOW THE ISSUANCE OF A WARRANT FOR INFORMATION FROM A VEHICLE'S RECORDING DEVICE THAT CONSTITUTES EVIDENCE OF ANY. MISDEMEANOR AS AMENDED INVOLVING A MOTOR VEHICLE. ADD CRASH RESULT. DEATH OR BODILY INJURY. BY ALLOWING THE INCH ISSUANCE OF A WARRANT FOR INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM A VEHICLE RECORDING DEVICE FOR NON FELONY OFFENSE. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT A. B. SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT UPSETS THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE INTERESTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND AND THE INTEREST OF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS AND PROTECTING THEIR PRIVACY I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THIS DOES NOT APPLY ONLY WHERE -- THE DRIVER IS THAT YOU KNOW DEAD OR UNCONSCIOUS BUT WOULD ALSO ALLOW ISSUANCE OF A SEARCH WARRANT TO GET THAT INFORMATION OR THE DRIVER SIMPLY DOES NOT WANT. IT TO BE SHARED -- AND I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT. YOU KNOW THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING BEING NECESSARY TO AN INVESTIGATION THIS IS INFORMATION THAT THAT SIMPLY DIDN'T EXIST -- NOT THAT VERY LONG AGO I AND YET INVESTIGATIONS MOVE FORWARD TO AND IN MANY CASES WERE PERFECTLY. CAPABLE OF OF RESOLVING WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE INCIDENT WE ASK FOR YOUR NOVEL -- LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER -- WITNESSES AN OPTICIAN. RIGHT SEEING NONE LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY DISCUSSION OR ALL RIGHT -- REMEMBER OBERNOLTE WHEN IT CLOSED CERTAINLY I JUST. THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS A LITTLE BUT IT'S SOMETHING I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO THE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT IT'S TALKED ABOUT A LOT. I WAS ACTUALLY THE FLOOR MANAGER FOR THAT BILL WHEN IT PASSED THE ASSEMBLY SEVERAL YEARS AGO SO IT'S AN ISSUE THAT I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT. LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS DOING SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR WITH EDR DATA THAT WHAT WE DID WITH THE KELLY CPA. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IT'S SETTING A VERY NARROWLY TAILORED SET OF CIRCUMSTANCE UNDER WHICH IT IS APPROPRIATE WITH THE COURT'S PERMISSION TO GET ACCESS TO THIS DATA. I LIKE TO ASK YOU KNOW IF YOU HAD A LEAD ONE THAT WAS KILLED OR SERIOUSLY INJURED IN ACCIDENT. WOULDN'T YOU WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATA THAT THEY NEEDED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT ON WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE REALLY WORKED TO LIMIT THE CIRCUMSTANCES AGAIN. STATUS FIVE SECONDS BEFORE TO ONE SECOND AFTER AN ACCIDENT IT'S ONLY CERTAIN PARAMETERS OF THAT DATA IT'S ONLY IN CASES INVOLVING SERIOUS BODILY INJURY OR DEATH. ONLY WITH. A SEARCH WARRANT ISSUED BY A COURT AND SIGNED BY A JUDGE. DOWN ONLY IN CASES INVOLVING SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS A MISDEMEANOR SO I'D APPRECIATE DRIVE A I APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERN OF THE PRIVACY ISSUES [inaudible] I'M. THIS ONE IS A AGAIN ONE OF THOSE WERE I AM SOMEWHAT TORN. MOSTLY BECAUSE I'M. ON THE ONE HAND. I THINK IT IS USEFUL FOR US TO HAVE BETTER INFORMATION AS TO WHAT MAY HAVE LED. TO THE INCIDENT. HOWEVER. IN ITS PROBE HAVEN'T NERO BUT IN THE NARROWNESS. THE INFORMATION IS LIMITED WE MAY LEARN SPEED. WE MAY LEARN WHETHER. SUPPLIED OR NOT -- SO IT'S A I NOT SURE HOW MUCH IT'LL ACT COOLEY. HELP US IN THE INVESTIGATION I'M. BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR TO THE MEMO YEAH AUSTIN ALL SUPPORTED TODAY BUT THIS IS ONE OF THESE DOWN [inaudible] BALANCING ACT. LET'S SEE IF THERE'S A MOTION RIGHT. THIS WOULD BE AN AS AMENDED. TWO PASSES AMENDED TO FLOOR OKAY BUT THE THANK. YOU THAT WAS YOUR CLOTHES WAS FOR OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER COMMENT.
