00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:35.827
PREVENTED IN ONE YEAR.

00:21:35.894 --> 00:21:36.728
MOST AMERICANS THINK THAT WE

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:38.497
HAVE SOLVED THE DRUNK DRIVING

00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:40.032
PROBLEM IN THE COUNTRY THE FACT

00:21:40.098 --> 00:21:43.168
IS WE HAVE NOT. TO THE CONTRACT

00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:44.302
COULD TO THE CONTRARY

00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:46.972
APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND OR

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:48.974
ONE THIRD OF ALL HIGHWAY DEATHS

00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:50.542
INVOLVE IMPAIR DRIVING.

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:51.677
AND THAT NUMBER HAS REMAINED

00:21:51.743 --> 00:21:54.046
STUBBORNLY CONSTANT FOR THE PAST

00:21:54.112 --> 00:21:55.881
TEN YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:58.083
THAT IS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.885
LOST LIVES IN PREVENTABLE

00:21:59.951 --> 00:22:01.553
CRASHES.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.654
BASED ON THE LACK OF PROGRESS

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:03.955
REDUCING ALCOHOL IMPAIRED

00:22:04.022 --> 00:22:05.323
DRIVING OVER THE LAST TWO

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:06.158
DECADES.

00:22:06.224 --> 00:22:07.993
IT IS CLEAR THAT MORE NEEDS TO

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.394
BE DONE TO PUT AN END TO THESE

00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:11.596
PREVENTABLE TRAGEDIES.

00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:12.864
THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT IGNITION

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:14.900
IGNITION INTERLOCK TECHNOLOGY

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:16.968
CAN AND SHOULD BE EMBRACED IN

00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:18.704
THIS BATTLE AT EVERY LEVEL AND

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:23.542
THIS IS WHY NTSB SUPPORTS SB.

00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:24.276
FIVE FOUR FIVE THERE IS NO

00:22:24.342 --> 00:22:25.577
ARGUMENT THAT ADDRESSING THIS

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:27.746
LEADING KILLER ON AMERICANS

00:22:27.813 --> 00:22:29.715
ROADS AMERICA'S ROADS REQUIRES A

00:22:29.781 --> 00:22:31.850
BOLD MULTI FACETED APPROACH THAT

00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:33.752
INCLUDES PREVENTING PREVIOUSLY

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:35.587
CONVICTED IMPAIRED DRIVERS.

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:37.222

pCONSUMED A MEASURABLE AMOUNT OF

00:22:39.925 --> 00:22:41.993
ALCOHOL.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.695
ALLOWING A SECOND CHANCE COULD

00:22:43.762 --> 00:22:44.596
MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE

00:22:44.663 --> 00:22:46.431
AND DEATH.

00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:48.233
THE NTSB URGES CALIFORNIA TO

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.568
STRENGTHEN ITS ADMISSION

DEFENDER OFFICE WE ARE OPPOSED.

00:24:03.675 --> 00:24:05.177
TO THE BILL.

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:06.545
A FEW THINGS BACKGROUND --

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.079
CENTER HILL AND I HAVE BEEN IN

00:24:08.146 --> 00:24:09.514
THIS POSITION BEFORE I THINK FOR

00:24:09.581 --> 00:24:11.817
THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO WE HAVE --

00:24:11.883 --> 00:24:13.018
BEEN DISCUSSING THE WIFE OUR

00:24:13.084 --> 00:24:14.452
PUBLIC POLICY HOW TO HANDLE IT

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:16.354
IN PARTICULAR ANALOG DEVICES SO

00:24:16.421 --> 00:24:17.756
THERE'S BEEN AN ONGOING

00:24:17.823 --> 00:24:19.090
DISCUSSION AND DEBATE --

00:24:19.157 --> 00:24:20.125
CERTAINLY WE'RE DEALING WITH

00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:22.360
SOME VERY SERIOUS ISSUES -- SOME

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:24.396
VERY SERIOUS TRAGEDIES -- THAT

00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:28.967
ARE OBVIOUSLY -- REGRETFUL.

00:24:29.034 --> 00:24:29.634
THAT BEING SAID WHAT WE HAVE --

00:24:29.701 --> 00:24:30.836
NEGOTIATING DISCUSSED OVER THE

00:24:30.902 --> 00:24:32.938
YEARS -- WAS SENT TO THE PILOT

00:24:33.004 --> 00:24:34.773
PROJECT -- AND ONE PIECE OF THE

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.608
PILOT PROJECT WAS IN FACT A

00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:36.842
STUDY.

00:24:36.908 --> 00:24:38.343
A AND AS THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:39.077
POINTS OUT.

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:40.712
ACCORDING TO THE PILOT PROJECT

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:43.281
THE THE MANDATORY USE OF IRAQ OF

00:24:43.348 --> 00:24:44.616
ICE ON FIRST OFFENSES DID NOT

00:24:44.683 --> 00:24:47.252
HAVE A STATISTICAL IMPACT.

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.954
ON INCREASE OR DECREASE OF

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.889
REPEAT AND D. Y. FENCES IF I

00:24:50.956 --> 00:24:52.324
REMEMBER CORRECTLY OR BELIEVE MY

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:53.925
MY BEEN REFERENCING CRASHES SO.

00:24:53.992 --> 00:24:54.893
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.862
REALLY KEY IN FACT WE HAD I DO

00:24:56.928 --> 00:24:57.863
REMEMBER HAVING TESTIMONY IN

00:24:57.929 --> 00:24:59.631
COMMITTEE WHEN WE WERE WAITING

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:01.833
FOR THE REPORT HOW WE PUSH BACK

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.702
A BILL WAITING FOR THE REPORT --

00:25:03.768 --> 00:25:05.604
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SEE -- WHAT

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.504
THE EVIDENCE IS GOING TO BE IN

00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:08.006
THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT A

00:25:08.073 --> 00:25:08.907
MANDATORY A LOCK IN A FIRST

00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:11.209
OFFENSE -- DID NOT HAVE THE IF

00:25:11.276 --> 00:25:12.644
THE DESIRED EFFECT AS I THINK

00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:13.912
THAT'S IMPORTANT KEEP IN MIND

00:25:13.979 --> 00:25:16.014
THE OTHER THING AND I'M GLAD --

00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:17.582
THE PROPONENTS MENTION OREGON.

00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:18.583
ONE THING THAT I HAVE BEEN

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:19.784
SAYING OVER THESE YEARS AND

00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:24.356
SOMETIMES I GET CRITICIZED FOR

00:25:24.422 --> 00:25:25.891
AND I TAKE THE CRITICISM.

00:25:25.957 --> 00:25:27.459
BUT DO YOU EYES AND ALCOHOLISM.

00:25:27.525 --> 00:25:27.993
REQUIRES A MULTI PRONGED

00:25:28.059 --> 00:25:29.828
APPROACH IS PROPONENTS INDICATED.

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:32.797
IN CALIFORNIA CLOSE 250% OF

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:33.899
ARRESTS FOR THE WISE OR NOT THE

00:25:33.965 --> 00:25:36.268
DRIVERS WHAT I'VE BEEN ASKING

00:25:36.334 --> 00:25:37.969
FOR SO IS A FULL.

00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:39.571
YOU KNOW FULL SPECTRUM APPROACH

00:25:39.638 --> 00:25:41.406
WE WANT TO REDUCE DEVICE WE NEED

00:25:41.473 --> 00:25:43.308
MORE FUNDING FOR ALCOHOL

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:44.576
PROGRAMS IN THESE COMMUNITIES

00:25:44.643 --> 00:25:46.878
CULTURALLY SENSITIVE CULTURALLY

00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:48.346
RELEVANT -- THE TALK ABOUT

00:25:48.413 --> 00:25:50.515
OREGON ORGANS CITIZENS ARE VERY

00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:52.017
INTERESTING THEY ALSO HAVE A DO

00:25:52.083 --> 00:25:53.818
YOU AYE DIVERSION PROGRAM.

00:25:53.885 --> 00:25:55.387
IN OREGON WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE

00:25:55.453 --> 00:25:56.955
HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS ALSO

00:25:57.022 --> 00:25:58.890
AN IDEA THAT I KNOW SENATOR HILL.

00:25:58.957 --> 00:26:00.558
AND I HAVE IT'S COME UP DURING

00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:01.960
OUR DISCUSSIONS AND DEBATES AND

00:26:02.027 --> 00:26:03.295
PRIOR BILLS.

00:26:03.361 --> 00:26:05.230
SO THEY'RE TAKING A MULTI

00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:06.831
PRONGED APPROACH I'M ALL.

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:08.033
FOR LET'S LOOK AT THE REAL

00:26:08.099 --> 00:26:09.000
PROBLEM LET'S LOOK AT TRYING TO

00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:11.736
REDUCE ALCOHOLISM REDUCE ALCOHOL

00:26:11.803 --> 00:26:12.871
RELATED INCIDENTS WERE ALL FOR

00:26:12.938 --> 00:26:13.638
THAT.

00:26:13.705 --> 00:26:15.206
MANDATORY ANALOG DEVICES

00:26:15.273 --> 00:26:16.942
ACCORDING TO THE THE STUDY

00:26:17.008 --> 00:26:18.510
DIDN'T WORK HERE.

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:19.678
WE SHOULD MOVE FOR THE OTHER

00:26:19.744 --> 00:26:22.547
THING ABOUT THE STATEWIDE PILOT --

00:26:22.614 --> 00:26:24.015
THAT WAS TESTED OUT THAT AMEND

00:26:24.082 --> 00:26:25.083
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:26.284
THAT AMENDMENT HAPPEN BECAUSE

00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:29.120
THEY WERE YEARS OF DEBATE ON-WHETHER OR NOT A MANDATORY.

00:26:29.187 --> 00:26:30.255
INTERLOCK DEVICE SHOULD BE USED

00:26:30.322 --> 00:26:31.389
FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WHAT WE

00:26:31.456 --> 00:26:32.791
FOUND IN STUDIES IS THAT WHEN IT

00:26:32.857 --> 00:26:34.292
IS AN OPTION.

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:36.027
WHEN IS INCENTIVIZE TO INSTALL

00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:38.797
INTERLOCK DEVICE IT IS MUCH MORE

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:39.831
EFFECTIVE?

00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:40.699
THEN IF IT'S IF IT'S MADE

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:41.800
MANDATORY THE LAST THING I'LL

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:42.901
MENTION THIS WHAT WE'VE BEEN

00:26:42.968 --> 00:26:43.902
HEARING FOR ATTORNEYS IN FROM

00:26:43.969 --> 00:26:45.170
THEIR CLIENTS.

00:26:45.236 --> 00:26:46.671
THAT DESPITE THE WELL THE THE

00:26:46.738 --> 00:26:48.573
BEST OF INTENTIONS OF CENTER

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.741
HILL ON THE PRIOR BILLS AND

00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:50.942
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE

00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:52.043
INTERLOCK DEVICES ARE AFFORDABLE

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.712
AND THERE'S A SLIDING SCALE.

00:26:53.778 --> 00:26:55.146
THE REALITY IS IN STATISTICS

00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:56.715
BEAR IT OUT AND STUDY BEARS IT

00:26:56.781 --> 00:26:56.915
OUT.

00:26:56.982 --> 00:26:58.950
THAT COMPLIANCE IS RELATIVELY

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:01.886
LOW BECAUSE DRIVERS CANNOT

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:02.687
AFFORD IT.

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:03.989
AND COMPANIES ARE STILL NOT

00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:06.958
PROVIDING A WAY TO PAY FOR IT

00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:08.626
MAKE IT AFFORDABLE AND EVEN.

00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:11.329
EVEN LOOKING AT PAYMENT PLANS WE

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:12.998
END UP WITH DRIVERS WHO MAY NOT

00:27:13.064 --> 00:27:14.399
OWE MONEY TO THE COURT OR WILL

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:15.133
THEY STILL OWE MONEY THE

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.501
CORPORATE ALSO -- MONEY TO THESE

00:27:16.568 --> 00:27:18.236
PRIVATE COMPANIES TO INSTALL THE

00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:20.939
INTERLOCK DEVICES SO THAT NEEDS

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:21.706
TO BE ADDRESSED AS WELL AND

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:22.741
CENTER HILLS ARE SENSITIVE TO

00:27:22.807 --> 00:27:24.642
THAT HAS WE HAS TRIED TO ADDRESS

00:27:24.709 --> 00:27:26.745
THAT BUT THEN THIS BILL IN THE

00:27:26.811 --> 00:27:28.079
FOR THE PRIOR BILL SO.

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:28.680
IT'S NOT THIS BILL IS NOT AS

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:29.814
SIMPLE AS IT APPEARS ON ON THE

00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:31.116
SURFACE YES WE WANT TO REDUCE

00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:33.218
THE Y. OFFENSES ABSOLUTELY WE

00:27:33.284 --> 00:27:34.419
WANT TO REDUCED U. I. TRAGEDIES

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:36.154
ABSOLUTELY BUT WE'VE HAD THIS

00:27:36.221 --> 00:27:37.322
DEBATE FOR NUMBER OF YEARS.

00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:39.090
WE SETTLED ON A CERTAIN APPROACH

00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:40.658
AND AGREED ON A CERTAIN APPROACH.

00:27:40.725 --> 00:27:42.827
AND THIS CHANGES THAT APPROACH --

00:27:42.894 --> 00:27:44.763
THAT IS AND IT IS CONTRARY TO

00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:46.064
WHAT THE STUDY SHOWS THAT WE

00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:47.766
COMMISSION HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO

00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:49.034
FOR THOSE REASONS REPOSE

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.836
AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS.

00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:53.338
YOU MISTER HERNANDEZ MISS CALLED.

00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:54.005
LESLIE CALDWELL CALIFORNIA

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:56.007
PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:58.343
MISTER AND THEN THIS IS THE

00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:59.611
PRETTY MUCH TOUCHED ALL THE

00:27:59.677 --> 00:28:02.380
POINTS THAT I WOULD -- TOUCH ON

00:28:02.447 --> 00:28:05.383
AND HAS MUCH MORE THE HISTORY

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.453
THEN I DO PERSONALLY HOWEVER --

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.688
FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT.

00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:12.657
I TO IN MY ORGANIZATION WE ARE

00:28:12.724 --> 00:28:14.926
DEEPLY SADDENED BY THE DEATH AND

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:17.929
THE INJURIES THAT PEOPLE SUFFER.

00:28:17.996 --> 00:28:20.865
DUE TO DRUNK DRIVING.

00:28:20.932 --> 00:28:23.268
AND I AGREE WITH THE SPEAKER

00:28:23.334 --> 00:28:25.603
FROMTHE NTSB THAT INTERVENTION

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.005
MUST START EARLY.

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:29.841
EARLY IS NOT AFTER SOMEONE HAS

00:28:29.908 --> 00:28:32.444
BEEN CONVICTED OF A G. A D. Y.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.879
EARLY AS LONG BEFORE THAT WE

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:36.247
NEED THE MONEY TO GO TO

00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:39.350
EDUCATION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. FOR

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:41.553
TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOL AND

00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:43.855
SUBSTANCE ABUSE THAT'S WHERE WE

00:28:43.922 --> 00:28:46.758
NEED TO FCUS NOT ON HAVING

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:49.694
SOMEONE PUT IN A VERY EXPENSIVE

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:52.063
INTO THEIR CAR A LOT OF THE OUR

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.766
CLIENTS AS PUBLIC DEFENDERS

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:56.468
DON'T EVEN HAVE THEIR OWN CAR.

00:28:56.534 --> 00:28:58.803
THEY'RE DRIVING SOMEONE ELSE'S

00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:59.537
CAR.

00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:01.573
SO THIS REQUIREMENT OF THE

00:29:01.639 --> 00:29:03.908
INTERLOCK UP WILL NOT MAKE A

00:29:03.975 --> 00:29:06.077
CHANGE FOR THEM SECONDLY.

00:29:06.144 --> 00:29:08.546
DRUNK DRIVING OFFENSES THE FIRST

00:29:08.613 --> 00:29:10.748
TIME YOU'RE SPENDING THOUSANDS

00:29:10.815 --> 00:29:14.686
OF DOLLARS IN FINES AND FEES AND

00:29:14.752 --> 00:29:17.288
AND INSURANCE IF YOU GO GET IT

00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:20.258
AND ALL THESE THINGS -- AND A

00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:22.093
LAWYER IF YOU CAN AFFORD A

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.130
LAWYER BUT MOST CANNOT MOST COME

00:29:25.196 --> 00:29:26.397
TO THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE.

00:29:26.464 --> 00:29:31.836
THOSE CLIENTS OF MINE HAVE TO DO-COMMUNITY SERVICE TO PAY FOR

00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:34.305
THEIR PHONE LINES THEY UP

00:29:34.372 --> 00:29:36.774
SOMETIMES GET CREDIT FOR MANY

00:29:36.841 --> 00:29:38.610
MANY DAYS IN JAIL THAT THEY

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:39.577
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN.

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:41.913
INCARCERATED BUT THEY GET THAT

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.848
CREDIT AGAINST THEIR PHONE LINES

00:29:43.915 --> 00:29:46.084
SO EVEN IF THEY'RE ONLY REQUIRED

00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:47.318
TO PAY 10%.

00:29:47.385 --> 00:29:51.489
OF THE COST OF THE INTERLOCK

00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:52.891
DEVICE.

00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:54.325
THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT JUST LIKE A

00:29:54.392 --> 00:29:55.226
MISTER LANDER SAID THEY JUST

00:29:55.293 --> 00:29:57.896
CAN'T AFFORD IT -- I AM

00:29:57.962 --> 00:29:59.931
CONCERNED ABOUT THE REFERRAL TO

00:29:59.998 --> 00:30:02.567
MANY OF THE STUDIES -- DUE

00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:04.402
RESPECT TO THE SPEAKERS AND TO

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:06.104
THE SENATOR MANY OF THESE

00:30:06.171 --> 00:30:08.306
STUDIES REFERRED TO DON'T JUST

00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:10.375
LOOK AT FIRST TIME DO YOU --

00:30:10.441 --> 00:30:13.077
LIKE SO YOU CANNOT RELY ON THOSE

00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:16.781
STATISTICS. TO MAKE DECISIONS

00:30:16.848 --> 00:30:19.384
ABOUT FIRST TIME DO YOU WHY.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:19.817
I'VE.

00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:21.653
BEEN IN CRIMINAL DEFENSE FOR

00:30:21.719 --> 00:30:23.888
THIRTY EIGHT YEARS I HAVE SEEN

00:30:23.955 --> 00:30:25.924
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF FIRST

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.257
TIME.

00:30:26.324 --> 00:30:30.395
DRUNK DRIVERS AND I HAVE NOT.

00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:32.430

THE FIRST TIME DRUNK DRIVERS I

00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:36.401
OFTEN FEEL LIKE.

00:30:36.467 --> 00:30:39.604
ALMOST ANYBODY COULD GET.

00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:40.939
THEIR FIRST TIME DRUNK DRIVERS

00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:43.908
DRIVING OFFENSE -- AND I KNOW

00:30:43.975 --> 00:30:46.644
THAT'S NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT

00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:48.446
TO SAY BUT I HAD THIS IS WHAT

00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:50.448
I'VE SEEN WITH MY FRIENDS.

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:54.586
MY OWN FAMILY -- AND MY CLIENTS.

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:56.221
IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT GO ON TO

00:30:56.287 --> 00:30:57.822
THEIR SECOND THAT REALLY NEED

00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:59.023
THE HELP AND THAT'S WHERE WE

00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.457
NEED.

00:30:59.524 --> 00:31:02.193
THE TREATMENT THE EDUCATION AND

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.928
THE ANALOG DEVICES NOT GOING TO

00:31:03.995 --> 00:31:06.965
CHANGE THAT -- OFTEN I AM AN

00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:08.800
ALLIANCE WITH THE COURTS

00:31:08.866 --> 00:31:09.667
DECISIONS WHEN THEY'RE

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:12.837
EXERCISING THEIR DISCRETION --

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:14.772
BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT'S

00:31:14.839 --> 00:31:15.974
APPROPRIATE TO TAKE THAT

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.776
DISCRETION AWAY FROM THE COURTS.

00:31:18.843 --> 00:31:21.379
IF ANYTHING THEY ARE VERY VERY

00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:23.114
SERIOUS ABOUT.

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:24.782
DO YOU AYE CASES AND IF THEY

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:26.684
BELIEVE THAT THIS DEVICE IS

00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:28.886
APPROPRIATE FOR FIRST TIME DRUNK

00:31:28.953 --> 00:31:29.387
DRIVING.

00:31:29.454 --> 00:31:32.824
OFFENDERS THEY WILL IMPOSE THIS

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.926
CONDITION AND I ASK YOU NOT TO

00:31:34.993 --> 00:31:36.594
TAKE THAT DISCRETION AWAY FROM

00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:38.196
THE COURT.

00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:39.130

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:55.713
CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILIES WHO

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.882
ARE HERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST.

00:31:57.949 --> 00:31:58.883
LOVED ONES TO DRUNK DRIVING.

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:02.887
OF I I CAN I I HOPE I NEVER HAVE

00:32:02.954 --> 00:32:05.223
TO KNOW BUT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.525
AND CERTAINLY -- WE NEED TO DO

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:10.194
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO EDUCATE AND

00:32:10.261 --> 00:32:11.963
PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING SO

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.798
UNNECESSARY AND YET SO

00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:15.366
DEVASTATING SO.

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:17.068
ARE THAT'S THE FRAMEWORK FROM

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:21.406
WHICH I'M COMING SO I'M -- I

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:23.675
HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS IF I MAY

00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:25.043
AND I'D LIKE TO ASK THE N. T. AS

00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:26.744
A PERSON AS WELL AS THE THE

00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:28.846
DEFENSE SIDE OF THIS IF.

IF I COULD -- OF A LOT OF WHAT

00:32:32.383 --> 00:32:33.518
WE'RE SEEING TODAY IS IN CHARGE

OF DRUNK DRIVING IT'S PEOPLE WHO

00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:36.287
ARE.

00:32:36.354 --> 00:32:38.156
DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF

00:32:38.222 --> 00:32:39.957
EVEN MEDICATIONS.

00:32:40.024 --> 00:32:41.926
OF THAT FOR PEOPLE DRIVING UNDER

00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:44.195
THE INFLUENCE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:47.365
CANNABIS -- GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT

00:32:47.432 --> 00:32:48.800
ELSE IS OUT THERE IN THE MARKET

00:32:48.866 --> 00:32:52.603
TODAY I CAN'T KEEP TRACK BUT IS.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.272
IS YOUR RESEARCH YOUR STUDIES

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:56.908
INDICATE THAT THESE ARE EQUALLY

00:32:56.974 --> 00:32:58.943
AS MUCH PROBLEM AND THAT THIS

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.445
DEVICE WILL.

00:33:00.511 --> 00:33:02.413
AFFECT THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE WHO

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.115
ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OTHER

00:33:04.182 --> 00:33:07.185
INTOXICANTS OUT WILL BE

00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:09.687
PRECLUDED FROM DRIVING A CAR.

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:10.722
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION.

00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:13.725
I'M THE DATA THAT WE HAVE AROUND

00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:16.160
DRUG IMPAIRED DRIVING IS NOT

00:33:16.227 --> 00:33:19.130
ACCURATE BECAUSE THE REPORTING

00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:21.366
IS INCONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE.

00:33:21.432 --> 00:33:23.101
HOWEVER WE DO KNOW ANECDOTALLY

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:25.670
THAT IT IS ON THE RISE -- BUT WE

00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:27.271
DON'T HAVE THE HARD NUMBERS TO

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:28.639
SAY THAT THIS IS EQUAL TO

00:33:28.706 --> 00:33:30.208
ALCOHOL IMPAIRED DRIVING WE DO

00:33:30.274 --> 00:33:31.442
HAVE THE HARD NUMBERS FOR

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:32.777
ALCOHOL IMPAIRED DRIVING.

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:37.014
AND THAT IN CALIFORNIA IS ONE

00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:37.615
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTEEN

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:40.017
OF FATALITIES IN CALIFORNIA FOR

00:33:40.084 --> 00:33:40.718
ANY AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL IN THE

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:42.754
SYSTEM.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.521
IN ANY AMOUNT MEANING YOU COULD

00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:45.323
HAVE A POINT NO ONE YET POINTA

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.525
ONE ALL THE WAY UP ONE THOUSAND

00:33:47.592 --> 00:33:48.459
HREE HUNDRED SIXTEEN FATALITIES

00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:49.761
IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:51.529
IT APPOINT A ONE THESE PEOPLE

00:33:51.596 --> 00:33:52.764
ARE DRIVING IMPAIRED.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.165
ALTHOUGH -- EXCUSE ME IMPAIRMENT

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:56.200
BEGINS AT THE FIRST RANK.

00:33:56.267 --> 00:33:58.469
IT BEGINS WELL I I KNOW THAT I I

00:33:58.536 --> 00:33:59.103
STARTED MY CAREER AS A

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.972
PROSECUTOR AND AT WHEN THE BLOOD

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:02.540
ALCOHOL LEVEL -- ACTUALLY HAD

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:05.877
JUST COME DOWN FROM A POINT. ONE

00:34:05.943 --> 00:34:06.644
FIVE TWO POINT ONE ALL IN OUR

00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:07.745
POINT.

00:34:07.812 --> 00:34:09.313
OH EIGHT SO YOU SUGGESTING THAT

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.449
WE SHOULD HAVE. ZERO TOLERANCE

00:34:11.516 --> 00:34:15.019
FOR ALCOHOL THE NUMBER ONE

00:34:15.086 --> 00:34:15.620
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTEEN

00:34:15.686 --> 00:34:17.355
IS A HIGH NUMBER BUT OUR OUR LAW

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:18.923
NOW SAYS THAT THAT YOU'RE

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:20.725
IMPAIRED AND APPOINT A WAITER

00:34:20.792 --> 00:34:21.159
BUFF.

00:34:21.225 --> 00:34:22.760
FEDERAL LAW ON NTSB HAS A

00:34:22.827 --> 00:34:25.163
RECOMMENDATION TO LOWER THE B.

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:27.365
AC TO POINT OH FIVE OR LOWER.

00:34:27.432 --> 00:34:29.500
SO THAT THAT IN AND OF ITSELF

00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:30.835
MIGHT HAVE THE IMPACT YOUR

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.703
SEEKING HERE IN REDUCING THE

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:34.238
NUMBER OF DEATHS BY.

00:34:34.305 --> 00:34:35.973
BILL WHO ARE IMPAIRED AS A

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.642
RESULT OF ALCOHOL.

00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:39.577
IT WOULD HAVE A BROAD DETERRENT

00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:42.013
TO BRING DOWN THE OF FATALITIES

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:42.680
IF YOU'RE TO LOWER THE BE A C.

00:34:42.747 --> 00:34:44.315
CORRECT -- BUT THEY'RE STILL

00:34:44.382 --> 00:34:46.017
WILL BE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO

00:34:46.083 --> 00:34:47.418
DRIVE IMPAIRED AND THAT IS FOR

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:48.152
THE IGNITION INTERLOCK WOULD

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:49.787
COME INTO PLAY IN TERMS OF

00:34:49.854 --> 00:34:50.788
DETERRING THEM FROM GETTING

00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:52.256
BEHIND THE WHEEL AFTER THEY'VE

00:34:52.323 --> 00:34:53.291
CONSUMED ALCOHOL.

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:54.692
ACCEPTED PHASES POINTED OUT MANY

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:55.827
OF THEM DON'T HAVE CARS TO THE

00:34:55.893 --> 00:34:57.662
DRIVING FRIENDS CARS.

00:34:57.728 --> 00:34:59.297
I'M WONDERING IS ARE SOME KIND

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:00.898
OF TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE.

00:35:00.965 --> 00:35:03.835
WHERE WE COULD IDENTIFY THEM NOT

00:35:03.901 --> 00:35:04.969
BY?

00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:07.605
THE YOU KNOW THAT DEVICE BUT THE

00:35:07.672 --> 00:35:09.040
OF THUMB PRINT THEY'RE GONNA BE

00:35:09.106 --> 00:35:10.508
DRIVING SOMEBODY ELSE'S CAR IS

00:35:10.575 --> 00:35:12.243
OR IS THERE SOMETHING OUT THERE

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:13.511
THAT MIGHT HAVE A BETTER.

00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:15.279
AFFECTED DETERRING PEOPLE

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:17.048
GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL WITH A

00:35:17.114 --> 00:35:18.950
IN ANY LEVEL OF IMPAIRMENT THERE

00:35:19.016 --> 00:35:20.384
IS TECHNOLOGY THAT IS.

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:22.086
BEING DEVELOPED FOR SPECIFICALLY

00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:24.856
ALCOHOL IMPAIRED DRIVING IF THE

00:35:24.922 --> 00:35:25.389
DRIVER [inaudible]

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:27.925
DRIVER THIS.

00:35:27.992 --> 00:35:30.962
D. A. D. S. S. -- AND I CAN'T I

00:35:31.028 --> 00:35:33.097
SORRY CAN'T RECALL -- YES DADS

00:35:33.164 --> 00:35:34.665
IN IT WASN'T NAME BY MOTHERS

00:35:34.732 --> 00:35:35.533
AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING IT WAS

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.668
NAMED BY THE AUTOMOBILE ALLIANCE

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:39.971
AND ITS DEFECTIVE -- DAD'S

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:41.839
EFFECTIVE ALCOHOL DETECTION

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:43.941
SAFETY SYSTEM AND IT IS USES

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:45.510
SKIN SPECTROSCOPY LOOKS MUCH

00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:47.345
LIKE WE USE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR

00:35:47.411 --> 00:35:48.946
PULSE OX READING.

00:35:49.013 --> 00:35:50.815
AND I WAS ACTUALLY AT AND NET SO

00:35:50.882 --> 00:35:52.817
WHEN THEY UNVEILED THE CONCEPT

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:54.552
CAR AND IT WAS IT HAD COME OVER

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:56.354
WITH FROM SWEDEN.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.257
IT USES -- TERROR ONE PROVIDERS

00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:02.059
TO IT'S IT'S MUCH.

00:36:02.126 --> 00:36:02.960
MORE.

00:36:03.027 --> 00:36:04.729
SENSITIVE THAN WHAT WE HAVE

00:36:04.795 --> 00:36:07.865
TODAY EVEN IN THE THE SOBRIETY

00:36:07.932 --> 00:36:09.400
FIELD TEST THANK YOU VERY SO

00:36:09.467 --> 00:36:12.069
PERHAPS NOT JUST IDENTIFYING ONE

00:36:12.136 --> 00:36:13.771
FORM OF TECHNOLOGY.

00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:15.806
BUT IN AS THE BILL PROCEEDS

00:36:15.873 --> 00:36:17.942
PERHAPS EXPANDING ITS FOR THAT

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.577
WE USE THE BEST AVAILABLE

00:36:19.644 --> 00:36:21.646
TECHNOLOGY WOULD SEEM TO ME. TO

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:23.180
TO AND ALSO SO THAT WE CAN

00:36:23.247 --> 00:36:25.082
INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT

00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:26.918
NECESSARILY BE DRIVING THEIR OWN

00:36:26.984 --> 00:36:29.220
CARS A BECAUSE I THINK THAT.

00:36:29.287 --> 00:36:31.822
THAT'S A CONCERN -- AND IN FACT

00:36:31.889 --> 00:36:33.724
MIGHT EVEN INTENTIONALLY.

00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:34.892
FIND SOMEBODY ELSE'S CAR TO

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:36.527
DRIVE AND AND AND WHAT HAVE YOU

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:39.196
BUT THAT BEING SAID ALSO -- IN

00:36:39.263 --> 00:36:41.766
YOUR RESEARCH -- THE ARGUMENT

00:36:41.832 --> 00:36:44.502
THAT AS MADE THE ODD PEOPLE WHO

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:46.904
TEND TO OF HAD JUST ONE DRUNK

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.406
DRIVING -- YOU KNOW PERHAPS WE

00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:49.974
CAUGHT A COME TO JESUS MOMENT

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:52.376
WHEN THEY STOP -- THEY REALIZE

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:54.278
THEY SHOULDN'T BE DRIVING WHAT

00:36:54.345 --> 00:36:56.981
ARE THE STATISTICS ON THAT.

00:36:57.048 --> 00:37:00.117
I'M SORRY CAN CAN USE -- IS.

00:37:00.184 --> 00:37:01.986
WE HAVE ALCOHOLICS TO DRIVE.

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:03.487
AND I THINK THEY'RE THE BIGGEST

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:05.022
RISK THAT WE HAVE ON THE ROAD I

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:06.223
THINK WE ALL AGREE.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.758
AND THE FACT THAT IT THE

00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:08.693
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ADDRESSING

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:11.329
ALCOHOLISM IN ADVANCE SO THAT.

00:37:11.395 --> 00:37:12.964
WE DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM RATHER

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:14.131
THAN AT THE END OF THE ROAD IF

00:37:14.198 --> 00:37:15.700
YOU WILL YEAH WHEN THEY'RE BONTA

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:17.234
BUSTED FOR DRUNK DRIVING.

00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:18.569
CATCH THEM SO WE DO WITH

00:37:18.636 --> 00:37:21.372
ALCOHOLISM UP FRONT BUT THERE

00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:23.808
ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD A

00:37:23.874 --> 00:37:26.143
SINGULAR ARREST FOR DRUNK

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:27.912
DRIVING BECAUSE THEY THEY

00:37:27.979 --> 00:37:29.280
CONSIDER THEMSELVES SOCIAL

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:30.815
DRINKERS AND THEY'VE HAD MORE

00:37:30.881 --> 00:37:32.183
ALCOHOL.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.818
THE THAN A POINT OH EIGHT BLOOD

00:37:33.884 --> 00:37:35.553
ALCOHOL WOULD ALLOW AND MY

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.921
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT.

00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:39.824
THOSE PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY TO

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:40.891
RECEIVE TO RECIDIVIST OR TO

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:42.293
REPEAT AND I'M WONDERING WHAT

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.462
THE STATISTICS ARE A IS THAT IS

00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:45.963
THAT ACCURATE BASED UPON THE

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.897
RESEARCH DONE BY YOUR

00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:48.633
ORGANIZATION I DON'T HAVE

00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:49.867
STATISTICS ON THAT RIGHT NOW BUT

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:51.736
I CAN GET THAT TO YOU.

00:37:51.802 --> 00:37:53.371
THE PERHAPS A THROUGH THE

00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:54.405
THROUGH THE CHAIR IF THEY'RE

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:56.741
STILL DOES SOMEBODY HAVE THOSE

00:37:56.807 --> 00:37:58.809
STATISTICS.

00:37:58.876 --> 00:37:59.644
MISTER HERNANDEZ THANK YOU

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.879
MISTER -- IF I RECALL AND THIS

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:03.447
IS BASED ON THE DMV STUDIES AND

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:04.815
AND AGAIN I WOULD JUST CAUTION

00:38:04.882 --> 00:38:05.750
THAT I'M DOING OFF OF MEMORY

00:38:05.816 --> 00:38:07.151
THAT I LOOK AT THE STATISTICS

00:38:07.218 --> 00:38:08.619
FAIRLY OFTEN.

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:09.887
BY RECALL I BELIEVE IT IS

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:12.456
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND 3% THE

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:15.292
RE OFFEND IN THE FIRST YEAR.

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:16.360
AND THEN I THINK IT GOES

00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:18.896
SOMEWHERE INTO CLOSE 212% AGAIN

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:19.730
IT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OFF ON

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:21.932
THIS OVER I BELIEVE A SEVEN YEAR

00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:23.601
PERIOD. SEVENTY EIGHT YEAR

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:24.435
PERIOD I COULD BE A LITTLE BIT

00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:24.969
OFF ON THAT BUT IT IT'S

00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:26.437
SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE IT MIGHT

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:28.172
EVEN BE A LITTLE BIT LOWER ON

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:29.507
THAT FIRST YEAR BUT I'M I'M.

00:38:29.573 --> 00:38:30.374
THAT'S THE BEST OF MY

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:31.676
RECOLLECTION BUT THESE ARE

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:34.111
PEOPLE OF FIRST TIME OFFENDERS

00:38:34.178 --> 00:38:35.279
CRACKED.

00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:37.815
SO THAT THEY FIRST THE FIRST

00:38:37.882 --> 00:38:38.616
TIME CONVENTIONAL DERRICK I'VE

00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:40.651
HEARD OF THIS SENATOR JACKSON

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:41.986
HAVE BEEN THAT IF YOU.

00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:43.054
BY THE TIME YOU GET THAT FIRST

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.588
DO YOU I KNOW YOU PROBABLY

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:46.257
DRIVEN ANYTIME ANYTIME I

00:38:46.323 --> 00:38:47.558
UNDERSTAND WRONG.

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:49.026
BUT THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN CAUGHT

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:52.430
NOW YOU'RE CAUGHT IN IMUS AND MY

00:38:52.496 --> 00:38:52.963
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WHEN

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.631
PEOPLE.

00:38:53.698 --> 00:38:55.566
HAVE THAT MOMENT WHEN THEY BEEN

00:38:55.633 --> 00:38:57.702
CAUGHT -- IN LESS THEY ARE

00:38:57.768 --> 00:39:00.871
ALCOHOICS THEY ARE LIKELY TO

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:02.606
REASSESS THEIR BEHAVIOR AND ARE

00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:05.176
LESS LIKELY TO RE OFFEND I'M

00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:06.744
JUST A IS THAT TRUE OR FALSE.

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:08.612
FALSE I BELIEVE THE MAN THAT

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:11.015
KILLED MY SON HAD -- FIVE

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:12.950
PREVIOUS -- SUSPENSIONS AND HE

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:13.517
WAS DRIVING ON A SUSPENDED

00:39:13.584 --> 00:39:15.853
LICENSE AT NIGHT AT POINT OH

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.054
NINE SIX BUT MY IN POINT IS THAT

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:19.924
THAT HE HAD HAD PROBABLY SEVERAL

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.157
OTHER.

00:39:20.224 --> 00:39:21.992
DO YOU Y. ARRESTS AND

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:23.627
CONVICTIONS SO I I WAS A

00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:25.796
CONVICTED OKAY BECAUSE THE THE

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:28.199
OUR LEGAL SYSTEM HE WAS A YOUNG

00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:29.700
MAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD.

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:31.535
AND THEY FELT THAT HE NEEDED

00:39:31.602 --> 00:39:33.370
HELP AND HE DIDN'T TAKE

00:39:33.437 --> 00:39:36.707
ADVANTAGE OF GETTING THAT HELP.

00:39:36.774 --> 00:39:37.908
AND WHEN I STE FIRST STARTED

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:39.443
COMING UP HERE TWELVE YEARS IT

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:40.478
WAS SENATOR BOB HUFF THAT TOLD

00:39:40.544 --> 00:39:42.279
ME AS DRACONIAN TO DO THIS AND I

00:39:42.346 --> 00:39:43.814
SAID IT'S DRACONIAN TO ALLOW FOR

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:44.548
PEOPLE DAY.

00:39:44.615 --> 00:39:46.083
I UNDERSTAND I I'M JUST AND I I

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.152
APPRECIATE WOULD YOU SAY I JUST

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.954
WANT TO TRY TO GET THAT ANSWER

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.256
BECAUSE I I I SUPPORT I SUPPORT

00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:53.591

BEEN CONVICTED.

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:03.000
OF A OR MAYBE JUST POPPED ONCE

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:04.735
OR TWICE FOR DRUNK DRIVING IF

THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT ALCOHOLIC

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:07.705
CLEARLY THIS YOUNG MAN HAD A

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:09.039
SERIOUS PROBLEM.

00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:10.508
BUT IF THEY'RE JUST PEOPLE WHO

00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:10.975

HAVE TO BE DRUNK.

00:40:18.816 --> 00:40:20.050
JUST IMPAIRED AND THAT'S AN

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:22.052
EDUCATION PROCESS THAT WE

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:23.621
PROBABLY SHOULD DO BUT PEOPLE

00:40:23.687 --> 00:40:30.427
WHO ARE ARRESTED WHO ARE ONLY

00:40:30.494 --> 00:40:31.428
QUOTE UNQUOTE IMPAIRED.

00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:32.329
WHAT IT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:33.130
PEOPLE WITH ONE ONE

CONFRONTATION WITH THE LAW? ONE

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:36.400
DRUNK DRIVING CONVICTION ARE

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:38.502
LIKELY TO REPEAT.

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:39.737
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S BEEN ONE

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:41.939
OF THE QUESTIONS I'M JUST I JUST

00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:43.841
WANT TO GET THAT ANSWER.

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:47.011
IF WE COULD -- BECAUSE I KNOW

00:40:47.077 --> 00:40:48.412
WHEN YOU HAVE TWO OR MORE YOU

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:49.814
KNOW YOU THE THESE ARE PEOPLE

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.017
BASICALLY ARE UNABLE TO CONTROL --

00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:54.919
OR MAKE PROP MAKE GOOD DECISIONS

00:40:54.985 --> 00:40:55.853
I THINK IS THE BEST WAY TO

DESCRIBE IT HERE'S PEOPLE OF

00:40:57.922 --> 00:40:59.623

MANY OF THEM WILL MAKE GOOD

00:41:01.058 --> 00:41:02.726
DECISIONS I UNDERSTAND AND MANY

00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:04.295
OF THEM WON'T BUT I'M WONDERING

00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:06.030
WHAT PERCENTAGES ACT THAT'S ALL

00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:08.432
I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT.

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:09.700

YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE IN FACT I

00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:21.879
WAS REMINDED OF ONE OF THE

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:23.948
STATISTICS WE HAVE IS IT.

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:26.283
IS IT ONE THIRD RE OFFEND. ONE

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.853
THIRD YES OKAY.

00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:29.887
BUT WHAT IS SET THROUGH IN

00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:31.822
CALIFORNIA [inaudible]

00:41:31.889 --> 00:41:32.857
YES.

00:41:32.923 --> 00:41:35.826
THE RATES ARE LOW.

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:37.261
ALRIGHT WELL IF.

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:38.429
WE ARE NOT WAS ORIGINALLY

00:41:38.495 --> 00:41:39.096
WRITTEN.

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:40.998
FOR SO T. THE TWENTY FIVE OR 30%

00:41:41.065 --> 00:41:43.100
STILL A BIG NUMBER THAT THAT

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:44.702
GOES TO YOUR CONCERNS.

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:46.904
ARE WELL I AM ARE THE ONLY OTHER

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:50.708
QUESTION IS -- I'M CONCERNED

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:53.844
THAT WE HAVE NOT DEVELOPED -- AN

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:55.679
EFFECTIVE WAY TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE

00:41:55.746 --> 00:41:57.681
WHO ARE DRIVING IMPAIRED BECAUSE

00:41:57.748 --> 00:41:59.450
OF THE USE OF RUGS -- SO

00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:00.985
SOMEONE MIGHT BE TAKING

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:01.819
MEDICATION OF ONE DRINK THE

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:04.221
BLOOD ALCOHOL COME OUT A POINT --

00:42:04.288 --> 00:42:06.924
THREE BUT THEY ARE IMPAIRED AND

00:42:06.991 --> 00:42:08.058
IF WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:09.593
SAVE LIVES WHICH I THINK IS THE

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.829
GOAL FOR ALL OF US IT SEEMS TO

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:11.996
ME.

00:42:12.062 --> 00:42:13.864
THAT WE'VE GOT TO WE'VE GOT TO

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:15.733
RECOGNIZE THAT A LOT OF

00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:16.934
IMPAIRMENT IS.

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.936
SUBSTANCE RELATED AND I'M

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:20.738
WONDERING IS THERE ANYTHING

00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:22.172
GOING ON NOW WITH THE NTSB I

00:42:22.239 --> 00:42:24.275
MEAN WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE

00:42:24.341 --> 00:42:26.110
OUT HOW TO JUDGE MARIJUANA FOR

00:42:26.176 --> 00:42:27.411
FORTY YEARS.

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:28.879
SO AND NOW MARIJUANA IS LEGAL

00:42:28.946 --> 00:42:30.314
LICENSE -- HOW ARE WE GOING TO

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:31.115
FIGURE OUT OF PEOPLE ARE

00:42:31.181 --> 00:42:32.283
IMPAIRED DRIVING UNDER THE

00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:34.618
INFLUENCE OF OF CANNABIS ANOTHER

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:36.854
NOW LEGAL DRUGS YEAH WE -- NTSB

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:38.322
DOES HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:39.056
THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:41.825
SAFETY ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:42.393
A WAY.

00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:43.661
TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF

00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:45.763
IMPAIRMENT UNTIL WE HAVE THAT WE

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:46.563
REALLY.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:49.733
CAN'T DO MUCH IN TERMS OF

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.635
ARRESTS OR ANYTHING I MEAN WE

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:52.303
HAVE THE WE ALSO HAVE

00:42:52.369 --> 00:42:53.871
RECOMMENDATIONS TO INCREASE THE

00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:55.239
NUMBER OF DRUG RECOGNITION

00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:57.975
EXPERTS -- SO THAT -- THEY HAVE

00:42:58.042 --> 00:42:59.543
A LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE A HIGHER

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.845
LEVEL OF TRAINING TO DETECT AND

00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:03.647
DETERMINE IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS

00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:05.616
IMPAIRED BY DRUGS ANY TYPE OF

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:06.383
DRUG.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.118
AND WE HAVE -- RECOMMENDATIONS

00:43:08.185 --> 00:43:09.820
TO THAT SO THAT WE CAN MAKE

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:11.021
THOSE ARRESTS FOR DRUG

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:12.990
IMPAIRMENT BUT IN TERMS OF

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:15.459
HAVING US LIKE A BIRD BUT BE A

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:17.328
C. FOR DRUG IMPAIRMENT THAT IS

00:43:17.394 --> 00:43:18.796
WE ARE UNABLE TO DO THAT AT THIS

00:43:18.862 --> 00:43:19.563
POINT.

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:20.264
IN YOUR ROOM IF I COULD LINE

00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:21.598
ABOUT ACTION TO ME WE HAD THE

00:43:21.665 --> 00:43:23.133
SAME PROBLEM FORTY YEARS WE DID

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:29.807
AND AND AS YOU KNOW IT AND YOU

00:43:29.873 --> 00:43:30.708
WITH YOUR HELP LAST YEAR.

00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:31.842
THERE IS WORK BEING DONE WITH I

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:32.609
THINK IS UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO

00:43:32.676 --> 00:43:33.577
OR SANDY AT UC SAN DIEGO WITH

00:43:33.644 --> 00:43:34.411
THE HIGHWAY PATROL THEY'RE NOW

00:43:34.478 --> 00:43:35.145
CONDUCTING THE STUDIES.

00:43:35.212 --> 00:43:35.813
AND THIS THE THE RESULTS OF THAT

00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:37.448
SHOULD BE BACK BY THE MIDDLE OF

00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:38.716
THIS YEAR IN FACT WE'RE LOOKING

00:43:38.782 --> 00:43:39.817
AT MAYBE AMENDED SOME

00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:41.385
LEGISLATION TO TRY AND INCLUDE.

00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:42.553
WHEN THEY DETERMINE WHAT THAT

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:44.621
LEVEL OF IMPAIR WHAT THAT LEVEL

00:43:44.688 --> 00:43:46.690
IS THAT CREATES THAT IMPAIRMENT

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:47.858
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND THEN WE

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:48.592
CAN?

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:51.862
WE CAN TRY TO PREVENT THAT SO

00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:53.831
SUPPORT THIS AYE IF I MAY JUST

00:43:53.897 --> 00:43:55.399
CLOSE BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO

00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:58.268
CONSIDER -- ALTERNATIVE METHODS

00:43:58.335 --> 00:43:59.837
BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY THAT

00:43:59.903 --> 00:44:02.606
WILL ALSO MOVE WITH THE ARE WITH

00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:05.476
THE PERSON -- AND ALSO CONSIDER

00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:06.477
THAT IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO

00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:08.512
TRY TO GET THESE PEOPLE OFF THE

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:09.813
ROAD WE'VE GOT TO IDENTIFY

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.248
PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST DRIVING

00:44:11.315 --> 00:44:13.250
IMPAIRED AS RESULT ALCOHOL.

00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:14.952
TO SENATOR JACKSON IF I MAY ADD

00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:16.820
TO THAT AS A TRAUMA -- ARE IN

00:44:16.887 --> 00:44:18.756
NURSING THE TRAUMA CENTER WE DO

00:44:18.822 --> 00:44:20.791
TRAUMA CAM PANELS ON OUR CRASHES

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:21.725
THAT COME IN.

00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:23.427
THERE ARE TWENTY DIFFERENT DRUGS

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:24.728
THAT WE TEST.

00:44:24.795 --> 00:44:26.096
FOR AND IT'S NEGATIVE POSITIVE

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:27.698
NEGATIVE POSITIVE UNTIL YOU GET

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:32.870
TO ALCOHOL AND THERE'S A LEVEL

00:44:32.936 --> 00:44:33.737
THERE IS NO -- MEANT LEVEL FOR

00:44:33.804 --> 00:44:34.371
ALL THE DIFFERENT DRUGS THAT WE

00:44:34.438 --> 00:44:35.472
HAVE SO WE HAVE TO HAVE PER SE

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:36.507
LAWS THERE I DON'T THINK THERE

00:44:36.573 --> 00:44:37.875
WOULD BE ANY WAY.

00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:39.810
THAT WE COULD GET AN IMPAIRMENT

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:41.512
LEVEL ON EACH DIFFERENT THE

00:44:41.578 --> 00:44:42.146
HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT DRUGS THAT

00:44:42.212 --> 00:44:43.881
WE HAVE.

00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:46.283
SO PER SE LAWS MAY BE WHAT WE

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:47.451
NEED AND I DO KNOW THAT

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:50.788
TECHNOLOGY IS BEING DEVELOPED --

00:44:50.854 --> 00:44:52.890
TO BY SOME OF THE COMPANIES TO

00:44:52.956 --> 00:44:54.758
MEASURE THE LEVEL OF DRUG THANK

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:55.893
YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR

00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:57.094
LONG ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON

00:44:57.161 --> 00:45:00.097
IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICES.

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:01.999
SENATOR BRADLEY YES THANK YOU

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:03.434
MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I WANT THANK

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.269
THE AUTHOR FOR THIS MEASURE.

00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:06.737
BUT AS YOU AND I DISCUSSED I

00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:08.005
HAVE SOME CONCERNS BECAUSE WHEN

00:45:08.072 --> 00:45:10.340
YOU LOOK AT THE DMV REPORT THEY

00:45:10.407 --> 00:45:11.542
SAID IT WAS.

00:45:11.608 --> 00:45:12.976
THEY WOULDN'T EXTEND THE PILOT

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:15.979
PROGRAM AND THEY FOUND IT TO BE

00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:17.448
COUNTER PRODUCTIVE.

00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:21.151
THOSE -- STATEMENTS BY THE DMV

00:45:21.218 --> 00:45:22.820
THAT STATED THAT AND ALSO

00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:24.721
REMOVING THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION

00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:26.356
I TALKED TO SOME OUR FRIENDS AND

00:45:26.423 --> 00:45:27.324
YOU AND I HAD OUR DISCUSSION

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:31.295
WHERE JUDGES AND THEY STATED

00:45:31.361 --> 00:45:33.097
PREFERRED THE DISCRETION OF

00:45:33.163 --> 00:45:35.866
DECIDING INDIVIDUALLY VERSUS A

00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:37.935
MANDATORY.

00:45:38.001 --> 00:45:38.869
REQUIREMENT FOR THE TECHNICIAN

00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:39.269
Là.

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:40.971
BUT WE HAVE THIRTY TWO OTHER

00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:41.538
STATES THAT HAVE GONE THIS

00:45:41.605 --> 00:45:44.808
DIRECTION AND THEY HAVE IT

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:46.243
MANDATORY FOR ALL OFFENSES SO IF

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:47.444
IF THEY FOUND.

00:45:47.511 --> 00:45:48.645
I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IF THEY

00:45:48.712 --> 00:45:49.646
THERE WAS A BETTER WAY THEY

00:45:49.713 --> 00:45:51.615
WOULD HAVE A DEVELOPMENT AT THE

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:53.250
TIME BUT I DON'T THE THE WORDING.

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:54.785
THE DMV REPORTS ALSO SHOWED A

00:45:54.852 --> 00:45:56.487
STRAW INCLUDING A STRONG AND

00:45:56.553 --> 00:45:58.689
RELIABLE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN AYE

00:45:58.755 --> 00:46:00.624
ID'S FOR FIRST TIME OFFENDERS

00:46:00.691 --> 00:46:02.559
AND REDUCE DO YOU WHY.

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:04.261
I'M QUOTING THAT.

00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:05.062
SO I THINK THAT SOMEONE IN.

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:07.498
IS NOT CONCLUSIVE THAT IT DID

00:46:07.564 --> 00:46:09.133
NOT HELP AS WE CAN SEE IT DID

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:11.168
SHOW STRONG RELIABLE ASSOCIATION

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:12.503
WITH THE REDUCTION.

00:46:12.569 --> 00:46:13.604
AND HOW WOULD THAT NUMBER IS

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:15.172
WHETHER IT'S TEN FIFTEEN A

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:16.907
HUNDRED PEOPLE THERE IF IT'S 10%

00:46:16.974 --> 00:46:18.842
OF THOSE THOUSAND THE WORKING.

00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:20.210
LIVE THAT SIGNIFICANT IN

00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:22.179
CALIFORNIA AND IN ANOTHER LEVEL

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:23.881
THAT WAS RAISED IN TERMS OF THEY

00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:25.215
ALSO MADE IT MADE COMMENTS IN

00:46:25.282 --> 00:46:28.018
THE ACCIDENTS WERE NOT RUDE OR

00:46:28.085 --> 00:46:29.019
IN THOSE COUNTIES WITH THE PILOT

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:29.920
PROGRAM THERE WAS AN INCREASE OF

00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:31.121
ACCIDENTS IN THOSE IN THOSE

00:46:31.188 --> 00:46:32.055
PILOTS WELL.

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:32.890
IT DIDN'T TAKE INTO

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:35.058
CONSIDERATION AT ALL THE MILES

00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:36.560
DRIVEN AND HIS CERTAINLY IF IN

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:37.728
THOSE COUNTIES IT.

00:46:37.794 --> 00:46:39.163
A LOT MORE MILES DRIVEN LOS

00:46:39.229 --> 00:46:40.764
ANGELES COUNTY THAN SOME OF THE

00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:41.665
OTHER COUNTIES THAT WE HAVE IN

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:43.367
THE STATE IN THOSE MILES MORE

00:46:43.433 --> 00:46:44.668
YOU DRIVE THE MORE ACTION SURE

00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:46.937
GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN.

00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:48.505
SO THE I I DON'T SEE THAT THE

00:46:48.572 --> 00:46:50.107
THE STUDY THE PILOT WAS IT

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:51.642
SHOULD CERTAINLY SHOWED LAST

00:46:51.708 --> 00:46:51.842
YEAR.

00:46:51.909 --> 00:46:52.776
ANOTHER.

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:54.978
AND CONCLUSIVE ENOUGH FOR THIS

00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:56.547
COMMITTEE TO VOTE SEVEN ZERO

00:46:56.613 --> 00:46:58.015
SENATE APPROPRIATIONS SEVEN ZERO

00:46:58.081 --> 00:46:59.850
ON THE FLORIDA VOTE THIRTY NINE

00:46:59.917 --> 00:47:00.617
ZERO WITH THE WAY IT WAS

00:47:00.684 --> 00:47:03.320
ORIGINALLY -- WRITTEN AND THE

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:05.289
WAY IT IS TODAY THAT AMENDMENT

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:08.825
CAME AT THE END AND STILL

00:47:08.892 --> 00:47:09.526
WITHOUT.

00:47:09.593 --> 00:47:11.495
A CLEAR IDENTIFICATION OF THAT

00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:14.498
SO I DON'T KNOW IF.

00:47:14.565 --> 00:47:15.599
THE STUDY IS NOT.

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:16.233
THE STUDY THAT WAS DONE BY THE

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.901
DMV IS NOT CONCLUSIVE IN

00:47:17.968 --> 00:47:19.269
DETERMINING THAT THERE'S IT AND

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:20.704
IT DOES SHOW THAT IT DID REDUCE

00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:22.673
RECIDIVISM.

00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:24.007
THAT THAT TO ME IS THE KEY

00:47:24.074 --> 00:47:24.808
[inaudible]

00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:28.011
AND FOLLOWING A LINE OF

THE RIDE SCHERING -- CLEARLY ISA HELP IN GIVING PEOPLE OPTIONS --

00:52:42.292 --> 00:52:44.094
BUT IT'S NOT EVERYTHING AND IF

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.962
WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TOOL --

00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:49.633
THIS IS SOMEONE WHO WE KNOW HAS.

00:52:49.699 --> 00:52:51.935

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:16.593
WE CAN TAKE AN ACTION.

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:17.460

01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:05.928
AND IN COLLUDED HAVE PHYSICAL

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:10.833
INJURY. TO ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.703
I CAN'T ABSOLUTELY SAY THAT THIS.

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:17.073
WOULD HAVE SAVED.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.876
OFFICE THINGS LIVE.

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:22.478
BUT THE POINT IS THAT COULD HAVE.

01:01:22.545 --> 01:01:25.515
WITH THE OUTSTANDING WARRANT.

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:27.583
HE COULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:30.386
PROSECUTION [inaudible]

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:34.724
INDOOR DEPORTATION.

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:36.292
SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE'RE

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.294
SINGLING ANYTHING OUT AND AND

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.730
THE AUTHOR OF THAT LEGISLATION.

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:41.731
IN FACT SAID IN THIS BILL IS

01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:42.965
CONSISTENT WITH THE AUTHOR'S

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:46.002
INTENT.

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:47.970
IF THERE WERE ACTIVE WARRANTS ON

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:49.305
THIS INDIVIDUAL.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.607
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WERE NOT

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:53.409
STOP BY SB FIFTY FOUR FROM

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:55.078
REPORTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TWO

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:56.512
I AN S. [inaudible]

01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:58.114
WHEN CONDITIONS?

01:01:58.181 --> 01:02:01.584
AS THOSE EXIST.

01:02:01.651 --> 01:02:02.752
AND THE GOVERNOR WHO SIGNED THAT

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:04.654
LEGISLATION [inaudible]

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.056
ALSO FIND.

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:09.859
THE POLICE TO THE SHERIFF.

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:11.160
COULD HAVE TOLD IMMIGRATION.

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:14.397
SERVICE ABOUT THIS INDIVIDUAL.

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:15.631
THAT HE AD BEEN ARRESTED AND

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:16.866
ACTUALLY CONVICTED TWICE OF THE

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:18.401
WHY.

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:20.470
AND THERE WAS A WARRANT. FOR HIS

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:22.972
ARREST.

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:24.607
SO I WILL ARGUE THAT THIS IS

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.442
TOTALLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:29.011
CURRENT LEGISLATION.

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.746
BUT IT DOES PROVIDE.

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:32.815
THE STATUTORY TOOL. FOR ONE

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:35.952

01:02:36.018 --> 01:02:37.487
IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS.

01:02:37.553 --> 01:02:40.389
THE COULD BE A DANGER.

01:02:40.456 --> 01:02:42.959
SIMPLY PUT THAT'S THE BILL.

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.327

SB FIFTY SB THIS BILL UNDERMINES

01:04:12.715 --> 01:04:14.483
THE BALANCE STRUCK BY SB FIFTY

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:15.151

THIS LIST OF EXEMPTIONS.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:23.492
BUT THIS BILL ADDS AND

01:04:23.559 --> 01:04:25.228
MISDEMEANOR DERIVE FENCES TO THE

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:33.102
AS SUCH THIS BILL AUTHORIZES

COOPERATION BASED ON DECADES OLD

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:37.340

CHANGE LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:41.944
THIS DOES NOT ALIGN WITH

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:44.447
CALIFORNIA'S COMMONSENSE

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:46.082

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:00.696
CURRENT LAW.

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:02.098
IT ALSO TIES COOPERATION TO A

PERSON UNLAWFUL PRESENCE IN THE

01:05:03.866 --> 01:05:04.967

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:07.837
THIS IS A HIGHLY COMPLEX AREA OF

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:08.571
LAW.

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:09.705

GROWN UPS IN THE ROOM -- I

01:08:58.167 --> 01:08:59.435

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:24.894

HEALTH APPROACH TO EARLY

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:45.740
CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT I THINK

01:30:45.807 --> 01:30:47.675
MANY OF THE THINGS THAT -- WERE

01:30:47.742 --> 01:30:48.643
RAISED HERE BY THE SPONSORS AND

01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:50.244

IS VERY MUCH COMMITTED -- TO

01:30:54.348 --> 01:30:56.918
FACTORS SUCH AS POVERTY TRAUMA --

01:30:56.984 --> 01:30:58.219
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES

01:30:58.286 --> 01:31:00.021
HUNGER THESE ARE ALL VERY VERY

01:31:00.087 --> 01:31:01.656
IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES --

01:31:01.722 --> 01:31:02.623
THAT CERTAINLY IF ADDRESSED

01:31:02.690 --> 01:31:04.725
EARLY CAN LIMIT THEM FROM COMING

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:09.297
INTO CONTACT WITH OUR JUSTICE

01:31:09.363 --> 01:31:11.566
THE AREA IN WHICH WE DISAGREE ON

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:12.500
IS AND AND WHERE WE HAVE A LOT

01:31:12.567 --> 01:31:13.868
OF CONCERNS IS REALLY THE

01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:15.837
APPROACH THAT THIS BILL TAKES --

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:17.138
IN COMBINING EARLY CHILDHOOD

01:31:17.205 --> 01:31:18.573
DEVELOPMENT AND DIVERSION UNDER

01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:21.642
A NEW COUNTY ENTITY. TO PROVIDE

01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:22.810
FOR THESE DIVERSION SERVICES --

01:31:22.877 --> 01:31:24.712
PROBATION OVER MANY MANY DECADES

01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:26.080
HAS INVESTED AND BUILD LINKAGES

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:27.248
AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:29.083
COUNTY DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:29.817
PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL

01:31:29.884 --> 01:31:32.753
SERVICES -- WE'VE WORKED --

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:33.888
EXTENSIVELY WITH COMMUNITY BASED

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:35.356
ORGANIZATIONS TOWARD THIS END

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:37.124
AND SO WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DATA

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:38.960
TO SHOW THE PRECIPITOUS DECLINE

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:40.828
ON THAT WE'VE HAD IN JUVENILE --

01:31:40.895 --> 01:31:42.430
ARREST RATES DETENTION RATES AND

01:31:42.496 --> 01:31:44.031
ALSO DIVERSION FROM THE FRONT

01:31:44.098 --> 01:31:45.032
INTO THE SYSTEM AND THAT'S AN

01:31:45.099 --> 01:31:46.701
AREA WHERE ARE ABSOLUTELY

01:31:46.767 --> 01:31:48.703
COMMITTED -- TO OUR PROGRAMS

01:31:48.769 --> 01:31:49.871
HAVE BEEN EVALUATED AND

01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:51.272
DETERMINE TO BE EVIDENCE BASED

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:52.907
AND SO ARE CONCERNED WITH MOVING

01:31:52.974 --> 01:31:54.075
AWAY FROM THIS WOULD BE THAT

01:31:54.141 --> 01:31:55.076
WE'RE GONNA.

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:56.344
BE STEP AWAY FROM OUTCOMES -- AN

01:31:56.410 --> 01:32:01.949
INTRODUCTORY THAT WE KNOW IS

01:32:02.016 --> 01:32:04.485
WORKING -- I THINK PART OF THE

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:05.720
CONCERN FOR US IS HAVING --

01:32:05.786 --> 01:32:06.654
AGAIN KIND OF DUAL ENTITIES AT

01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:07.622
THE COUNTY LEVEL DOING BOTH

01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:08.322
DOING DIVERSION WORK -- AND THIS

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:09.924
NEW ENTITY SET UP IN A WAY THAT

01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:11.392
DOESN'T NECESSARILY --

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:13.160
INCORPORATE PROBATION I THINK WE

01:32:13.227 --> 01:32:14.095
EQUATE THIS TO A SIMILAR

01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:15.663
CONSTRUCT IN WHICH YOU HAVE TO

01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:17.598
STATE AGENCIES THAT WOULD BOTH

01:32:17.665 --> 01:32:18.466
HAVE THE SAME MISSION A

01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:20.268
RESPONSIBILITIES AND AT THE END

01:32:20.334 --> 01:32:21.669
OF THE DAY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:32:21.736 --> 01:32:23.371
THAT THERE ARE NOT ANY.

01:32:23.437 --> 01:32:24.972
LOTS OF EFFICIENCIES -- A

01:32:25.039 --> 01:32:26.841
DECLINE IN DELIVERY OF SERVICES

01:32:26.908 --> 01:32:28.075
ARE THINGS THAT WOULD IMPACT THE

01:32:28.142 --> 01:32:30.778
YOUTH -- THAT THAT POTENTIALLY

01:32:30.845 --> 01:32:31.812
NOW WOULD WOULD KIND OF COME

01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:34.448
UNDER THESE THESE TWO ENTITIES --

01:32:34.515 --> 01:32:35.883
I THINK ONE OF THE STATED GOALS

01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:36.817
OF THE BILL IS TO MINIMIZE

01:32:36.884 --> 01:32:37.752
CONTACT WITH THE JUVENILE

01:32:37.818 --> 01:32:40.254
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WE BELIEVE IN

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:41.055
A AN IMPORTANT WAY TO DO THIS

01:32:41.122 --> 01:32:42.623
WERE TO HAPPEN TO HAVE THIS BILL

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:43.891
FOCUS ON TE EARLY CHILDHOOD

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:44.792
DEVELOPMENT SO.

01:32:44.859 --> 01:32:46.260
BEFORE THEY'RE EVEN ARRESTED

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:47.361
BEFORE THEY'RE COMING INTO THE

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:49.830
SYSTEM FOCUS ON AGAIN ALL OF THE

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:51.565
ASPECTS THAT A FOR SUCCESSFUL

01:32:51.632 --> 01:32:53.834
THERE KEEP THEM FROM EVEN COMING.

01:32:53.901 --> 01:32:55.469
NEAR OR INTO.

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:57.705
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM I THINK EEN

01:32:57.772 --> 01:32:59.140
AS A PILOT AGAIN BECAUSE OF KIND

01:32:59.206 --> 01:33:01.342
OF THESE DUPLICATIVE PARALLEL --

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:03.644
COUNTY ENTITIES WERE CONCERNED

01:33:03.711 --> 01:33:05.112
AGAIN -- THAT THERE'S

01:33:05.179 --> 01:33:06.580
POSSIBILITIES OF KIND OF THE

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:08.683
ABILITY TO ADDRESS BEHAVIOR --

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:09.717
FOR YOUTH IN THE WAY THAT I

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:11.752
THINK WE ALL WANT TO SEE -- SO

01:33:11.819 --> 01:33:13.187
AGAIN FOR US I THINK A BILL THAT

01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:14.755
FOCUSES ON THE FRONT END YOUTH

01:33:14.822 --> 01:33:15.823
DEVELOPMENT OF ALL OF THE THINGS

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:17.625
THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT -- WOULD

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:18.659
MEET THE GOALS AND ULTIMATELY

01:33:18.726 --> 01:33:20.861
WOULD HAVE THE IMPACT OF OF

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:21.862
SERVING IN KIND OF A DIVERSION

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:24.165
CAPACITY WITHOUT IT CREATING --

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:26.634
A DUPLICATION OF COUNTY EFFORTS

01:33:26.701 --> 01:33:28.035
FOR NOW HAVING TO ENTITIES BOTH

01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:29.837
WORKING ON DIVERSION AND INSTEAD

01:33:29.904 --> 01:33:31.172
CONTINUE TO ALLOW PROBATION TO

01:33:31.238 --> 01:33:33.307
WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS

01:33:33.374 --> 01:33:36.310
AND COMMUNITY -- COUNTY AGENCIES

01:33:36.377 --> 01:33:38.012
TO BEST DELIVER SERVICES AND

01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:39.447
HAVE THIS FOCUS ON THE VERY

01:33:39.513 --> 01:33:41.515
FRONT END OF THE SYSTEM -- SO

01:33:41.582 --> 01:33:42.216
WITH THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:46.687
OPPOSED AND AND AGAIN LOOK

01:33:46.754 --> 01:33:48.189
FORWARD TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS.

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:48.689
ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

01:33:48.756 --> 01:33:52.360
OPPOSITION.

01:33:52.426 --> 01:33:54.028
RIGHT MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE

01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:55.196
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS CENTER

01:33:55.262 --> 01:34:01.268
MORE LACK MANAGER -- THE SANCHEZ --

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:02.870
YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU

01:34:02.937 --> 01:34:03.904
ALREADY GOT METRICS THAT ARE

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:05.006
SHOWING YOUR VERY VERY

01:34:05.072 --> 01:34:07.341
SUCCESSFUL SO I'M JUST CURIOUS

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:09.844
CENTER MINING.

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:11.812
WHAT MORE CAN WE DO THAT THIRTY

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:13.180
BEING DONE?

01:34:13.247 --> 01:34:14.515
WITH THE KERN.

01:34:14.582 --> 01:34:16.384
WELL IT'S A FAIR QUESTION AND I

01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:18.019
ALSO WANNA OFFER MONEY.

01:34:18.085 --> 01:34:20.054
RESPECT FOR THE WORKER PROBATION

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:21.288
DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING CERTAINLY

01:34:21.355 --> 01:34:23.357
IN MY DISTRICT THERE'S BEEN SOME

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:27.528
WONDERFULLY INNOVATIVE EFFORTS --

01:34:27.595 --> 01:34:29.296
TO LOOK AT THE DIVERSION SIDE

01:34:29.363 --> 01:34:31.198
THAT SAID WHAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT

01:34:31.265 --> 01:34:33.868
WITH THESE PILOT PROGRAMS.

01:34:33.934 --> 01:34:35.369
IS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH

01:34:35.436 --> 01:34:37.872
THROUGH A PUBLIC HEALTH GATEWAY

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:39.073
WHERE THE CHILD IS NOT

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:41.709
STIGMATIZED BY BEING PART OF A

01:34:41.776 --> 01:34:43.611
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM -- THAT

01:34:43.677 --> 01:34:46.781
DOES INVOLVE OFTEN BARS AND

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:48.449
DETENTION FACILITIES EVEN WHERE

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:50.785
THERE IS COLLABORATION WE ALSO

01:34:50.851 --> 01:34:52.553
BELIEVE I BELIEVE STRONGLY THIS

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:53.687
WOULD NOT PRECLUDE IN THESE

01:34:53.754 --> 01:34:56.557
PILOTS COLLABORATION WITH THE

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:57.491
PROBATION OFFICERS AND

01:34:57.558 --> 01:34:58.659
DEPARTMENTS IN FACT I THINK IT'S

01:34:58.726 --> 01:34:59.994
SUCCESS.

01:35:00.061 --> 01:35:02.229
WOULD BE ROOTED IN BUILDING

01:35:02.296 --> 01:35:03.931
THOSE PILLARS OF COLLABORATION

01:35:03.998 --> 01:35:06.100
WE THINK WE CAN LEARN SOME BEST

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:09.203
PRACTICES FROM THE PUBLIC A HELP.

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:11.939
PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH -- IN AS

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:14.909
THE PROBATION -- DIVISIONS HAVE

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:16.811
SAID GETTING TO THE FRONT END OF

01:35:16.877 --> 01:35:19.080
WHAT'S LANDING CHILDREN IN THE

01:35:19.146 --> 01:35:20.915
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM -- IS

01:35:20.981 --> 01:35:23.084
EXACTLYWHAT THESE PILOTS CAN DO

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:25.352
LOOKING AT SUPPORT SERVICES FOR

01:35:25.419 --> 01:35:28.155
FAMILIES EARLY IDENTIFICATION --

01:35:28.222 --> 01:35:29.590
WHERE THERE'S PARTNERSHIPS WITH

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:30.691
SCHOOLS WITH PROBATION

01:35:30.758 --> 01:35:32.493
DEPARTMENT -- AND HOPEFULLY

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.795
BEFORE THERE'S CONTACT WITH LAW

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:36.931
ENFORCEMENT -- WE THINK LOS

01:35:36.997 --> 01:35:39.600
ANGELES IS MAKING GOOD HEADWAY.

01:35:39.667 --> 01:35:41.001
LOS ANGELES COULD ALSO BE A

01:35:41.068 --> 01:35:42.937
BENEFICIARY.

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:44.839
AS POTENTIALLY ONE OF THE PILOTS

01:35:44.905 --> 01:35:49.009
WERE WE WE LEARN FROM THEM AND

01:35:49.076 --> 01:35:50.377
DEVELOPING THE OTHERS.

01:35:50.444 --> 01:35:51.011
SO THIS WILL BE A GRANT PROGRAM

01:35:51.078 --> 01:35:52.613
IT WILL AND IT WILL BE TAKEN UP

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:54.515
IN APPROPRIATIONS -- WHICH OF

COURSE THIS IS THE POLICY

01:35:56.717 --> 01:35:58.052
COMMITTEE IT WOULD REQUIRE

01:35:58.119 --> 01:35:59.787
BUDGET ALLOCATION FOR

01:35:59.854 --> 01:36:01.922
IMPLEMENTATION THERE WERE WHAT

01:36:01.989 --> 01:36:02.556
KIND NUMBERS WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:36:02.623 --> 01:36:03.724
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT A

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:05.292
DEPARTMENT RIGHT A WHOLE NEW.

01:36:05.359 --> 01:36:06.894
ACTUALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT BUT

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:08.462
YOUR SING WITH EXISTING COUNTY

01:36:08.529 --> 01:36:10.798
SERVICES -- WE'RE SEEKING TEN

01:36:10.865 --> 01:36:12.333
MILLION DOLLARS WE THINK THAT

01:36:12.399 --> 01:36:14.001
WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE

01:36:14.068 --> 01:36:16.370
PURPOSES OF THE PILOT. THREE TO

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:18.272
FIVE COUNTIES VOLUNTARY IT'LL BE

01:36:18.339 --> 01:36:20.608
THE COUNTIES THAT STEP UP IN

01:36:20.674 --> 01:36:22.209
WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS.

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:23.511
FUNDING.

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:26.614
THANK YOU THANK THANK YOU --

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.781
THANK YOU CENTER MORE LIKE

01:36:27.848 --> 01:36:28.082
[inaudible]

01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:29.283
I'M [inaudible]

01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:34.054
I I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I

01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:35.289
WOULD NOTE THAT.

01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:36.891
IS WE HAVE AN INTERESTING

01:36:36.957 --> 01:36:40.127
CIRCUMSTANCE NOW WHERE -- THE

01:36:40.194 --> 01:36:43.097
NUMBER OF JUVENILES IN OUR

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:44.231
COUNTY FCILITIES IS AN OUT ALL

01:36:44.298 --> 01:36:47.234
TIME LOW AND HAS BEEN GOING DOWN

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:48.235
FOR TWENTY YEARS TO THE POINT

01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:50.204
WHERE WE HAVE COUNTIES IN ONLY A

01:36:50.271 --> 01:36:51.071
FIVE PEOPLE.

01:36:51.138 --> 01:36:52.139
IN THERE TOO LITTLE FACILITIES

01:36:52.206 --> 01:36:53.941
WHERE AS WE HAVE MADE WE THE

01:36:54.008 --> 01:36:55.776
STATE MADE HUGE INVESTMENTS.

01:36:55.843 --> 01:36:56.877
IN FUNDING THE COUNTIES TO

01:36:56.944 --> 01:36:58.946
EXPAND THESE FACILITIES WHICH

01:36:59.013 --> 01:36:59.847
ARE NOW COMPLETELY UNDER

01:36:59.914 --> 01:37:01.916
UTILIZED.

01:37:01.982 --> 01:37:07.621
AND AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH

01:37:07.688 --> 01:37:07.821
WELL.

01:37:07.888 --> 01:37:08.455
OF HUGE.

01:37:08.522 --> 01:37:09.690
THE LARGE PORTION OF THAT DROP

01:37:09.757 --> 01:37:11.392
IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT.

01:37:11.458 --> 01:37:12.960
CRIME RATES AMONGST JUVENILES IS

01:37:13.027 --> 01:37:13.794
DOWN.

01:37:13.861 --> 01:37:15.429
THE OTHER PORTION IS BECAUSE WE

01:37:15.496 --> 01:37:17.131
DO DO DIVERSION PROGRAMS BUT

01:37:17.198 --> 01:37:19.333
INTERESTINGLY.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:20.968
WE HAVE AND WE I DON'T HAVE

01:37:21.035 --> 01:37:22.336
EXACT NUMBERS YET BUT I'VE BEEN

01:37:22.403 --> 01:37:24.538
ASKING FOR DATA.

01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:27.174
THERE ARE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE IN

01:37:27.241 --> 01:37:28.676
FOR MISDEMEANORS THAN I THINK

01:37:28.742 --> 01:37:30.978
MOST OF US WOULD BE PLEASED WITH.

01:37:31.045 --> 01:37:33.781
AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHY.

01:37:33.847 --> 01:37:35.883
AND IT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE%

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:38.185
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE THE

01:37:38.252 --> 01:37:39.887
PRESENCE OF DIVERSION PROGRAMS

01:37:39.954 --> 01:37:40.955
ARE NOT THERE COULD BE OTHER

01:37:41.021 --> 01:37:42.289
FACTORS.

01:37:42.356 --> 01:37:43.791
BUT CERTAINLY AS HE'S CRIME

01:37:43.857 --> 01:37:46.627
RATES GO DOWN I THINK WE I DON'T

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:48.896
THINK WE REALLY ENVISIONED THESE

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:50.931
FACILITIES PRIMARILY FOR

01:37:50.998 --> 01:37:52.333
MISDEMEANOR.

01:37:52.399 --> 01:37:55.936
AND I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE STATE.

01:37:56.003 --> 01:37:57.805
JUVENILE FACILITIES WHICH ARE.

01:37:57.871 --> 01:37:59.974
POPULATION IS DOWN ALSO ARE FOR

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.842
CLEARLY SERIOUS SERIOUS

01:38:01.909 --> 01:38:04.778
OFFENDERS -- BUT REALLY LOW

01:38:04.845 --> 01:38:05.913
LEVEL YOU KNOW WE WOULD HOPE

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:07.881
THAT WE WOULD BE -- HANDLING

01:38:07.948 --> 01:38:10.284
THEM IN WAYS OTHER THAN HOLDING

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:10.584
THEM.

01:38:10.651 --> 01:38:16.323
SO -- WHETHER THIS BILL HELPS US

01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:18.192
TO GET AT TRYING TO MAKE SURE

01:38:18.259 --> 01:38:20.861
THAT WE DON'T HAVE MISDEMEANOR

01:38:20.928 --> 01:38:22.129
LOW LEVEL MISDEMEANORS IN OUR

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:24.064
COUNTY FACILITIES -- I WOULD

01:38:24.131 --> 01:38:28.736
HOPE SO -- SO AS I INDICATED I

01:38:28.802 --> 01:38:31.572
AM SUPPORTIVE BUT I ALSO AM IN

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.941
TERMS MY HAT AS BEING THE BUDGET

01:38:34.008 --> 01:38:35.409
SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR.

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:37.678
LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY AT WHAT

01:38:37.745 --> 01:38:40.047
THE STATE IS GIVING TO COUNTIES

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:41.615
IN RELATIONSHIP TO JUVENILES

01:38:41.682 --> 01:38:45.686
BECAUSE OF HOW FEW JUVENILES ARE

01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:47.288
NOW IN COUNTY FACILITIES.

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:48.922
AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS

01:38:48.989 --> 01:38:51.659
BEING SPENT PER JUVENILE IS VERY

01:38:51.725 --> 01:38:53.394
VERY HIGH IN SANTA CLEAR THE

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:55.262
RECENT NUMBERS WERE. FIVE

01:38:55.329 --> 01:38:58.132
HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND ABOUT --

01:38:58.198 --> 01:38:58.766
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTEEN SOMEWHERE

01:38:58.832 --> 01:39:00.434
UP WERE OVER FIVE HUNDRED K. PER

01:39:00.501 --> 01:39:03.904
JUVENILE -- ANYWAY SO THESE ARE

01:39:03.971 --> 01:39:05.973
ALL THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:08.842
AT BUT CERTAINLY THE OBJECTIVE.

01:39:08.909 --> 01:39:11.812
OF INTERVENTIONS WITH JUVENILES

01:39:11.879 --> 01:39:13.280
SO THAT.

01:39:13.347 --> 01:39:17.084
WE CAN PREVENT THEM FROM.

01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:17.885
WHICH IS THE WE CAN.

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:20.120
PUT THEM ON A GOOD PATH IS IS

01:39:20.187 --> 01:39:21.288
VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND THIS IS

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:23.023
A PILOT SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING

01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:24.425
IT.

01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:26.994
CENTER MORE LACK.

01:39:27.061 --> 01:39:28.595
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- COMING

01:39:28.662 --> 01:39:30.564
FROM COUNTY LAND.

01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:32.032
AND APPRECIATING WHAT PROBATION

01:39:32.099 --> 01:39:34.868
DEPARTMENTS DO AND LOOKING AT

01:39:34.935 --> 01:39:36.036
THE DATA AND SEEING HOW

01:39:36.103 --> 01:39:38.539
SUCCESSFUL THEY HAVE BEEN.

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:40.074
I'M I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:41.508
THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS AND

01:39:41.575 --> 01:39:45.879
REMINDING OF OF ADDING MORE COST --

01:39:45.946 --> 01:39:47.214
AND IT OUT I WANT TO GIVE A

01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:48.582
SHOUT OUT TO PROBATION

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:51.585
DEPARTMENTS FOR SOME INCREDIBLE

01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:52.186
DATA THAT THAT WE HAVE A AND

01:39:52.252 --> 01:39:56.390
BECAUSE COUNTIES TEND TO HAVE

01:39:56.457 --> 01:39:56.957
DEPARTMENTS THAT OPERATE IN

01:39:57.024 --> 01:39:58.359
SILOS.

01:39:58.425 --> 01:39:59.727
IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE SOME

01:39:59.793 --> 01:40:01.328
MORE CROSS TRAINING IF I COULD

01:40:01.395 --> 01:40:03.430
USE SOME KIND OF TERM.

01:40:03.497 --> 01:40:04.998
WHERE WE WORK TOGETHER BETWEEN

01:40:05.065 --> 01:40:07.134
THE DEPARTMENTS HELP IT CETERA --

01:40:07.201 --> 01:40:09.203
IN MAYBE IT FIRST START WITH

01:40:09.269 --> 01:40:11.972
DEVELOPING A PROGRAM AND DO SOME.

01:40:12.039 --> 01:40:13.907
CROSS POLLINATION FIRST BEFORE

01:40:13.974 --> 01:40:16.377
WE SET UP OF A PILOT PROGRAM

01:40:16.443 --> 01:40:17.878
ZABI OPPOSE TODAY.

01:40:17.945 --> 01:40:19.413
BUT I'LL BE WATCH UNDERSTAND OF

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.514
THROUGH THERE IF I COULD JUST

01:40:20.581 --> 01:40:22.416
RESPOND TO THAT I APPRECIATE THE

01:40:22.483 --> 01:40:23.784
CONCERN BUT I THINK.

01:40:23.851 --> 01:40:25.386
THE STATISTIC SHARED BY THE

01:40:25.452 --> 01:40:28.055
CHAIR POINT.

01:40:28.122 --> 01:40:30.057
TO NOT ONLY SUCCESS OF PROBATION

01:40:30.124 --> 01:40:31.992
AND JUVENILE JUSTICE SERVICES TO

01:40:32.059 --> 01:40:35.496
A POINT BUT ALSO THE THE HIGH

01:40:35.562 --> 01:40:38.732
COST OF THAT PATH OF FIVE

01:40:38.799 --> 01:40:39.400
HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND PER

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:41.235
INCARCERATED USE.

01:40:41.301 --> 01:40:43.804
IF IF FOR A FRACTION OF THAT

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:46.640
WERE INVESTED IN SUCCESSFUL ON

01:40:46.707 --> 01:40:47.741
PUBLIC HEALTH SOCIAL

01:40:47.808 --> 01:40:49.076
INTERVENTION PROGRAMS A FEW

01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:50.677
YEARS AGO I WORKED WITH.

01:40:50.744 --> 01:40:52.679
THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL COMMA

01:40:52.746 --> 01:40:55.783
HARRIS ANA LOOKING AT USE WHO

01:40:55.849 --> 01:40:57.351
WERE FOUND TO BE TRUANT IN

01:40:57.418 --> 01:41:00.120
PROSECUTIONS OF PARENTS FOR

01:41:00.187 --> 01:41:01.355
TRUANT USE.

01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:02.923
IN GETTING THEM OUT OF THE

01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:04.525
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT

01:41:04.591 --> 01:41:07.194
WHERE THERE'S CHRONIC TRUANCY

01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:08.662
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:10.364
LET'S TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT'S

01:41:10.431 --> 01:41:11.965
GOING ON AND I THINK THIS BUILDS

01:41:12.032 --> 01:41:13.967
ON THAT SAME PHILOSOPHY.

01:41:14.034 --> 01:41:15.803
AND I THINK A BROADER PHILOSOPHY

01:41:15.869 --> 01:41:17.404
IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM OF

01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:18.705
SEEING.

01:41:18.772 --> 01:41:20.774
MANY OF THE STARTERS IS BEING

01:41:20.841 --> 01:41:24.978
SOCIAL MEDICAL ISSUES NOT CRIME

01:41:25.045 --> 01:41:27.848
PER SE NOT CRIMINAL INDIVIDUALS

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:31.819
SO -- I THINK.

01:41:31.885 --> 01:41:32.519
THIS DOESN'T CONTEMPLATE

01:41:32.586 --> 01:41:33.120
BUILDING SILENCE I THINK THE

01:41:33.187 --> 01:41:34.087
PILOTS THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL THAT

01:41:34.154 --> 01:41:36.190
WE CAN LEARN FROM WILL BE THOSE

01:41:36.256 --> 01:41:38.492
THAT INTEGRATE EXISTING SERVICES.

01:41:38.559 --> 01:41:40.427
DRAWN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH LINK

01:41:40.494 --> 01:41:42.496
FAMILIES TO BEHAVIOR HEALTH

01:41:42.563 --> 01:41:44.565
WHERE APPROPRIATE -- MAYBE IT'S

01:41:44.631 --> 01:41:46.800
AS SIMPLE AS PRIMARY CARE MAYBE

01:41:46.867 --> 01:41:48.669
THROUGH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM THE

01:41:48.735 --> 01:41:50.838
VISION OF THESE PILOTS IS THEY

01:41:50.904 --> 01:41:53.140
DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES TO SEE IF

01:41:53.207 --> 01:41:54.274
THERE'S SOMETHING.

01:41:54.341 --> 01:41:55.943
THAT PROBATION THE CRIMINAL

01:41:56.009 --> 01:41:58.011
JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT BEHAVIOR

01:41:58.078 --> 01:41:59.780
HEALTH AND SCHOOLS CAN LEARN

01:41:59.847 --> 01:42:01.915
FROM SO THAT'S THAT'S THE

01:42:01.982 --> 01:42:04.218
INITIATIVE HERE WE THINK IN THE

01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:06.487
LONG RUN COST SAVING.

01:42:06.553 --> 01:42:07.821
IN MAYBE SO I SIT THERE SENATOR

MITCHELL HAS IT AND THEN --

01:42:10.591 --> 01:42:11.792

MITCHELL AND THAT I THE BILL HAS

01:42:17.931 --> 01:42:19.633
ALREADY BEEN CANCELED THANK YOU.

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:21.101
QUICK QUESTION SENATOR MINING IS

01:42:21.168 --> 01:42:26.874

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:48.548
THE REGISTRY.

01:54:48.615 --> 01:54:50.850
BUT THE COURT IS NOT REQUIRED TO

01:54:50.917 --> 01:54:51.818
DO SO.

01:54:51.884 --> 01:54:52.752
THAT IS CURRENT LAW IN

01:54:52.819 --> 01:54:54.420
CALIFORNIA.

01:54:54.487 --> 01:54:56.823
ON THE OTHER HAND.

01:54:56.889 --> 01:54:58.958
IF TE SAME EXACT SITUATION

01:54:59.025 --> 01:55:01.227
OCCURS AN ADULT HAS SEX WITH A

01:55:01.294 --> 01:55:01.861

01:55:03.363 --> 01:55:04.731
OLDER.

01:55:04.797 --> 01:55:05.999
BUT IF THE INTERCOURSE INSTEAD

01:55:06.065 --> 01:55:07.233
OF BEING VAGINAL IS SOMETHING

01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:10.169
ELSE A ORAL OR ANAL SEX.

01:55:10.236 --> 01:55:12.772
I'VE BEEN THE COURT IS MANDATED

01:55:12.839 --> 01:55:14.707
TO PLACE THE OFFENDER.

01:55:14.774 --> 01:55:15.308
ON THE REGISTRY.

01:55:15.375 --> 01:55:18.378
NO MATTER WHAT.

01:55:18.444 --> 01:55:19.879
THESE THE REASON THAT THIS

01:55:19.946 --> 01:55:21.748
DISTINCTION EXISTS OF COURSE IS

01:55:21.814 --> 01:55:22.915
THAT WHEN THE SEX OFFENDER

01:55:22.982 --> 01:55:24.350
REGISTRY WAS CREATED IN THE

01:55:24.417 --> 01:55:27.020
NINETEEN FORTIES -- ALL FORMS OF

01:55:27.086 --> 01:55:28.621
ENTERS INTERCOURSE OTHER THAN

01:55:28.688 --> 01:55:32.025
VAGINAL INTERCOURSE WERE ILLEGAL --

01:55:32.091 --> 01:55:33.826
WALLED IN ALL THOSE OTHER FORMS

01:55:33.893 --> 01:55:35.328
OF INTERCOURSE WERE LEGALIZED IN

01:55:35.395 --> 01:55:37.096
THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE

01:55:37.163 --> 01:55:40.900
REGISTRY WAS NEVER CHANGE -- SO

01:55:40.967 --> 01:55:44.771
AS A RESULT -- WE SEE VERY.

01:55:44.837 --> 01:55:46.873
PROBLEMATIC RESULTS FIRST OF ALL

01:55:46.939 --> 01:55:48.741
THIS INTENSELY DISCRIMINATES

01:55:48.808 --> 01:55:51.077
AGAINST LGBT YOUNG PEOPLE

01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:53.713
BECAUSE BY AND LARGE WHEN LGBT

01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:55.214
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HAVING SEX --

01:55:55.281 --> 01:55:58.818
THEY CANNOT HAVE PENILE VAGINAL

01:55:58.885 --> 01:55:59.018
SEX.

01:55:59.085 --> 01:56:01.988
AND SO WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE

01:56:02.055 --> 01:56:03.289
IT'S AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD BOY.

01:56:03.356 --> 01:56:05.124

01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:12.265
REQUIRED TO PUT HIM ON THE SEX

01:56:12.332 --> 01:56:14.567
OFFENDER REGISTRY.

01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:16.569
BY CONTRAST IF AN EIGHTEEN YEAR

01:56:16.636 --> 01:56:19.539
OLD BOY HAS INTERCOURSE WITH HIS

02:00:20.313 --> 02:00:24.984
BECAUSE THE COURT GOT IT RIGHT.

02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:26.586
IN HARSHER.

02:00:26.652 --> 02:00:27.887

NOW THE JOHNSON CASE RELIED ON

02:00:43.869 --> 02:00:46.639

SPIRIT OF THAT RULING.

02:00:55.781 --> 02:00:58.918
THAT MAKES ANY SENSE.

02:00:58.985 --> 02:01:00.353
IT OVERTURNED IS SAYING WE CAN

02:01:00.419 --> 02:01:01.554

THAT ONE CAN RESULT IN PREGNANCY.

02:01:09.895 --> 02:01:12.898
AND THE OTHERS CANNOT.

02:01:12.965 --> 02:01:13.499
SEEMS RATHER COUNTERINTUITIVE

02:01:13.566 --> 02:01:15.334
DOESN'T IT.

02:01:15.401 --> 02:01:16.736

THE DAY IN FACT -- REGISTRABLE.

02:01:32.585 --> 02:01:34.253
IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK.

02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:35.821
AT THE ACTUAL PURPOSE OF THE

02:01:35.888 --> 02:01:38.024
REGISTRY REMEMBER IT'S NOT THE

02:01:38.090 --> 02:01:39.892
PUNISHMENT FOR THE CRIME.

02:01:39.959 --> 02:01:42.595
IT'S A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE THAT

02:01:42.662 --> 02:01:44.430
HAS TO DO WITH CRIME SOLVING AND

02:01:44.497 --> 02:01:48.534
KEEPING TRACK OF PREDATORS.

02:01:48.601 --> 02:01:50.603
WHEN YOU REQUIRE SOMEBODY TO

02:01:50.670 --> 02:01:52.471
REGISTER FOR AN OFFENSE THAT IS

02:01:52.538 --> 02:01:54.440
NOT PREDATORY THAT THE PERSON

02:01:54.507 --> 02:01:55.908
HAS LITTLE TO NO RISK OF RE

02:01:55.975 --> 02:01:57.076
OFFENSE?

02:01:57.143 --> 02:01:58.577
YOU START A CHAIN REACTION.

02:01:58.644 --> 02:02:00.646
NUMBER ONE THAT STARTS WITH THE

02:02:00.713 --> 02:02:02.682
PROSECUTION OF THE CASE.

02:02:02.748 --> 02:02:03.983
TRIALS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY

02:02:04.050 --> 02:02:05.551
BECAUSE SOMEONE IS NOT GOING TO

02:02:05.618 --> 02:02:07.186
PLEAD TO THESE OFFENSES.

02:02:07.253 --> 02:02:08.688
GIVEN THE REGISTRATION IF

02:02:08.754 --> 02:02:10.523
SOMEONE IS CONVICTED.

02:02:10.589 --> 02:02:12.191
YOU HAVE SOMEONE GOING IN AND IT

02:02:12.258 --> 02:02:13.859
TAKES THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF

02:02:13.926 --> 02:02:15.761
TIME TO REGISTER SOMEONE FOR ONE

02:02:15.828 --> 02:02:16.762
OF THESE OFFENSES.

02:02:16.829 --> 02:02:19.598
AS IT TAKES TO REGISTER A SERIAL

02:02:19.665 --> 02:02:21.767
RAPIST OR SERIAL CHILD MOLESTER.

02:02:21.834 --> 02:02:23.836
THAT MEANS A POLICE OFFICER IN

02:02:23.903 --> 02:02:25.571
EVERY CITY IN THE STATE OF

02:02:25.638 --> 02:02:27.707

REGISTERING ONE OF THESE NO RISK

02:02:31.077 --> 02:02:33.179
OFFENDERS RATHER THAN FOLLOWING

FAIRNESS.

02:02:58.971 --> 02:03:00.706

HIGH SCHOOL ON THE BASKETBALL

02:03:24.096 --> 02:03:25.498
TEAM.

02:03:25.564 --> 02:03:28.801
WAS IN A CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP.

02:03:28.868 --> 02:03:29.869
WITH A FELLOW HIGH SCHOOL

02:03:29.935 --> 02:03:30.369
STUDENT.

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:32.004
AND THAT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT SHE

02:03:32.071 --> 02:03:34.774
WAS.

02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:35.875
EIGHTEEN THE MOTHER WAS DEVOUTLY

02:03:35.941 --> 02:03:37.943
RELIGIOUS.

02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:39.745
AND SHE FELT THAT BECAUSE HER

02:03:39.812 --> 02:03:40.679
DAUGHTER WAS IN A SAME SEX

02:03:40.746 --> 02:03:42.281
RELATIONSHIP.

02:03:42.348 --> 02:03:43.916
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE FAULT OF

02:03:43.983 --> 02:03:45.451
THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD.

02:03:45.518 --> 02:03:47.953
THEREFORE SHE CALLED THE POLICE.

02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:50.489
AND THAT CASE WAS INVESTIGATED.

02:03:50.556 --> 02:03:51.891
AND THAT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD BAN

02:03:51.957 --> 02:03:53.025
HAS.

02:03:53.092 --> 02:03:55.895
POLICE DOCUMENTS POLICE REPORTS

02:03:55.961 --> 02:03:58.597
RECORDING THIS ALLEGED CRIME.

02:03:58.664 --> 02:04:00.266
THE MOTHER THEN CALLED THE UC

02:04:00.332 --> 02:04:02.468
SCHOOL.

02:04:02.535 --> 02:04:03.969
WHERE THE GIRL HAD GOTTEN A FULL

02:04:04.036 --> 02:04:05.704
SCHOLARSHIP?

02:04:05.771 --> 02:04:07.106
AND BECAUSE THE GIRL HAD USED

02:04:07.173 --> 02:04:08.974
ARE YOU SEE E. MAIL THAT SHE

02:04:09.041 --> 02:04:10.543
RECEIVED FOR HER NEXT INCOMING

02:04:10.609 --> 02:04:12.011
FRESHMAN YEAR.

02:04:12.077 --> 02:04:13.746
IN SENDING AN INNOCUOUS EMAIL TO

02:04:13.813 --> 02:04:15.247
THE DAUGHTER.

02:04:15.314 --> 02:04:16.982
MANAGED TO GET THE SCHOLARSHIP

02:04:17.049 --> 02:04:17.883
RESCINDED.

02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:20.352
DO YOU SEE SCHOOL.

02:04:20.419 --> 02:04:22.021
SO THE DAUGHTER [inaudible]

02:04:22.087 --> 02:04:25.825
AND AND THE DAUGHTER.

02:04:25.891 --> 02:04:27.326
IT WAS THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD

02:04:27.393 --> 02:04:28.327
WAS ACTUALLY THE PERSON WHO

02:04:28.394 --> 02:04:29.528
ASKED THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD OUT

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:31.564
ON THEIR FIRST DATE.

02:04:31.630 --> 02:04:33.299
THEY WERE IN A LOVING

02:04:33.365 --> 02:04:33.899
[inaudible]

02:04:33.966 --> 02:04:36.869
COMBINED RELATIONSHIP.

02:04:36.936 --> 02:04:37.937
AND IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF THIS

02:04:38.003 --> 02:04:40.639
MOTHER'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.

02:04:40.706 --> 02:04:41.841
AND THE FACT THAT SHE THOUGHT

02:04:41.907 --> 02:04:42.808
SHE COULD PREVENT HER DAUGHTER

02:04:42.875 --> 02:04:44.443
FROM BEING GAY.

02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:46.345
BY TAKING OUT HER REVENGE ON

02:04:46.412 --> 02:04:49.915
THIS EXEMPLARY EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD.

02:04:49.982 --> 02:04:51.016
THAT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS LIFE WAS

02:04:51.083 --> 02:04:53.052
ALREADY RAW AND I COULDN'T STOP

02:04:53.118 --> 02:04:53.919
THE SCHOLARSHIP FROM BEING

02:04:53.986 --> 02:04:55.855
RECENT IT I COULDN'T STOP HER

02:04:55.921 --> 02:04:56.755
FROM GETTING IN TROUBLE AT

02:04:56.822 --> 02:04:58.090

02:04:58.157 --> 02:04:59.892
EXPELLING HER.

02:04:59.959 --> 02:05:02.962
THE ONE THING I WAS ABLE TO STOP.

02:05:03.028 --> 02:05:05.030
WAS THAT SHE WAS NOT PROSECUTED

02:05:05.097 --> 02:05:06.565
SO SHE DIDN'T BECOME A SEX

02:05:06.632 --> 02:05:08.133
OFFENDER REGISTRY.

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:09.301
AND IF I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO

02:05:09.368 --> 02:05:11.937
STOP THAT.

02:05:12.004 --> 02:05:12.872
THE REST OF HER LIFE WOULD HAVE

02:05:12.938 --> 02:05:14.740

MORE LIKELY TO RESULT IN A REST.

02:05:52.811 --> 02:05:54.914

FOLKS ARE IN THE PLACE WHERE

02:16:04.256 --> 02:16:05.524
BECAUSE PART OF THE REGISTRY IS

02:16:05.590 --> 02:16:07.092
THAT YOU MUST INDICATE WHERE YOU

02:16:07.158 --> 02:16:11.329

RULES AND BY NOW THIS

02:16:15.767 --> 02:16:16.968
DISCRIMINATORY AND I'M SURE

02:16:17.035 --> 02:16:18.236
THEY'RE STILL MORE THINGS THAT

02:16:18.303 --> 02:16:19.771
NEED TO BE CORRECTED.

02:16:19.838 --> 02:16:21.907
WE HAD SUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF

02:16:21.973 --> 02:16:24.576
PEOPLE THAT WE ARE NO LONGER IT

02:16:24.643 --> 02:16:26.945

POINT OF VIEW.

02:16:29.481 --> 02:16:31.550

TO REALLY THANK YOU.

02:16:32.918 --> 02:16:35.887
AND THEN THIS CORRECTION.

02:16:35.954 --> 02:16:38.356
IS ALSO ESSENTIAL BECAUSE WE

02:16:38.423 --> 02:16:40.792
HAVE SITUATION NOW WHILE THIS

02:16:40.859 --> 02:16:42.360
CORRECTION DOESN'T.

02:16:42.427 --> 02:16:44.195
IMPACT THIS PER SE.

02:16:44.262 --> 02:16:45.897
IF YOU'RE MANDATORY REPORTER

02:16:45.964 --> 02:16:47.899
WHICH TEACHERS ARE.

02:16:47.966 --> 02:16:50.835
AND YOU YOU CAN HAVE A LOT TO

02:16:50.902 --> 02:16:52.904
STUDENTS IN YOUR SENIOR CLASS

02:16:52.971 --> 02:16:53.505
THAT ARE.

02:16:53.572 --> 02:16:54.906
EIGHTEEN AND YOU CAN HAVE

02:16:54.973 --> 02:16:56.241
STUDENTS IN YOUR CLASSES THAT

02:16:56.308 --> 02:16:58.777
ARE IN SAME SEX RELATIONSHIPS

02:16:58.843 --> 02:17:00.512
ONCE EIGHTEEN ONCE NOT.

02:17:00.579 --> 02:17:02.614
IN YOUR THEN IN THIS GRAY AREA

02:17:02.681 --> 02:17:04.316
IT'S IT BECAUSE TECHNICALLY

02:17:04.382 --> 02:17:05.817
UNDER THE LAW.

02:17:05.884 --> 02:17:07.586
IF A PERSON IS UNDER EIGHTEEN

02:17:07.652 --> 02:17:09.921
THEY ARE NOT CONSENSUAL.

02:17:09.988 --> 02:17:10.789
SO.

02:17:10.855 --> 02:17:12.457
AND NOW CLEARLY THIS DOESN'T

02:17:12.524 --> 02:17:13.825
REMOVE.

02:17:13.892 --> 02:17:16.695
THE ONUS ON A MANDATORY REPORTER

02:17:16.761 --> 02:17:17.796
BUT IT CERTAINLY.

02:17:17.862 --> 02:17:21.099
LIMIT THAT PROSECUTION ON THE

02:17:21.166 --> 02:17:24.836
SAME SEX -- INDIVIDUALS -- OR

02:17:24.903 --> 02:17:26.404
EVEN FOR THAT MATTER ON

02:17:26.471 --> 02:17:29.808
HETEROSEXUAL AND COUPLES BECAUSE

02:17:29.874 --> 02:17:31.743
OF THE BIZARRE DISTINCTION.

02:17:31.810 --> 02:17:33.812
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE

02:17:33.878 --> 02:17:35.747
CLINTON -- WHATEVER WILL LEAVE

02:17:35.814 --> 02:17:37.082
THAT ALONE LEWINSKI SIT

02:17:37.148 --> 02:17:39.417
CIRCUMSTANCE BUT SO WE HAVE

02:17:39.484 --> 02:17:42.787
THESE BIZARRE DISTINCTIONS WHICH

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:44.589
REALLY GREW OUT OF A PREJUDICE

02:17:44.656 --> 02:17:45.824
AND HAVE NO.

02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:48.026
NO BEARING NOW SO I REALLY

02:17:48.093 --> 02:17:49.694
APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS.

02:17:49.761 --> 02:17:52.197
I WOULD -- SAY THAT WE ALSO

02:17:52.263 --> 02:17:53.765
PROBABLY NEED TO CORRECT.

02:17:53.832 --> 02:17:55.266
IN THE FIRST BILL WHERE WE

02:17:55.333 --> 02:17:57.102
CREATED THE TEARS WE PROBABLY

02:17:57.168 --> 02:17:59.804
SHOULD HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO

02:17:59.871 --> 02:17:59.971
BE.

02:18:00.038 --> 02:18:01.740
RE TIERED AUTOMATIC VERSUS THE

02:18:01.806 --> 02:18:03.375
INDIVIDUAL HAVING TO PETITION

02:18:03.441 --> 02:18:05.076
FOR IT SO MAYBE WE CAN LOOK AT

02:18:05.143 --> 02:18:07.278
THAT IN THE FUTURE BUT TODAY WE

02:18:07.345 --> 02:18:08.880
ARE JUST DEALING WITH.

02:18:08.947 --> 02:18:10.849
CHANGING THIS DISCRIMINATORY

MY FATHER TAUGHT ME.

02:26:12.930 --> 02:26:14.065

EVERYTHING WE GOT.

02:26:16.067 --> 02:26:21.906
SO THAT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY.

02:26:21.973 --> 02:26:22.807
BECAUSE OF MY AGE IN MY

02:26:22.874 --> 02:26:24.942
SITUATION HAD VERY LIMITED

02:26:25.009 --> 02:26:27.678

02:26:38.589 --> 02:26:41.225
SILENT.

02:26:41.292 --> 02:26:44.562
WAS A MECHANISM.

02:26:44.629 --> 02:26:45.830
SO THAT I COULDN'T REACH OUT AND

02:26:45.897 --> 02:26:50.735
REPORT ANYTHING.

02:26:50.801 --> 02:26:52.370

SEX WORKERS FEARED CARRYING

02:35:05.896 --> 02:35:07.698
CONDOMS BECAUSE THEY COULD LEAD

02:35:07.765 --> 02:35:08.799

HAD GONE WITHOUT CONDOMS DUE TO

02:35:13.537 --> 02:35:15.239
FEAR OF ARREST.

02:35:27.851 --> 02:35:28.552
EVIDENCE.

02:35:28.619 --> 02:35:29.887
IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IF

CONDOMS CAN GET YOU ARRESTED

02:35:31.255 --> 02:35:32.656

USE THEM.

02:35:34.825 --> 02:35:36.427

SEX WORKERS FROM CARRYING

02:35:37.494 --> 02:35:38.862

INITIATIVES.

02:35:46.704 --> 02:35:47.671

PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE OF AIDS FOR

ITS CONDOM DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM.

02:35:55.379 --> 02:35:56.880
THE SPELL OF A CONTRADICTION WE

02:35:56.947 --> 02:35:57.781
COULD POSSIBLY HAVE OUR PUBLIC

02:35:57.848 --> 02:35:58.816

02:35:58.882 --> 02:36:00.784
CONDOMS TO A POPULATION OF SEX

02:36:00.851 --> 02:36:01.618
WORKERS AND THEN HAVE LAW

02:36:01.685 --> 02:36:03.087
ENFORCEMENT ARRESTING THOSE SEX

02:36:03.153 --> 02:36:03.954
WORKERS FOR THE POSSESSION OF

02:36:04.021 --> 02:36:05.823
WHAT MAY BE THOSE VERY SAME

02:36:05.889 --> 02:36:07.024
CONDOMS.

02:36:07.091 --> 02:36:08.625
SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE IN

02:36:08.692 --> 02:36:11.495
WITHOUT A COMPELLING PUBLIC AND

02:36:11.562 --> 02:36:12.730
INTEREST IN HAVING SEX WORKERS

02:36:12.796 --> 02:36:14.164
FEEL FREE TO CARRY CONDOMS ONE

02:36:14.231 --> 02:36:15.799
WOULD IMAGINE ANY OPPOSITION TO

02:36:15.866 --> 02:36:17.134
THE SPIRIT OF THIS PROVISION.

02:36:17.201 --> 02:36:18.402

02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:20.104
COMPELLING NEED FOR THE USE OF

WE HAVE NOT YET HEARD SUCH A

02:36:22.806 --> 02:36:24.508
NEED ARTICULATED.

02:36:24.575 --> 02:36:25.843
IN FACT IT APPEARS THAT THE

02:36:25.909 --> 02:36:26.844
OPPOSITION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:36:26.910 --> 02:36:28.145

02:36:29.046 --> 02:36:30.414
APPLY.

02:36:30.481 --> 02:36:31.215
INSTEAD IT FOCUSES ON THE

02:36:31.281 --> 02:36:32.049
ASSERTION THAT MATTERS OF

02:36:32.116 --> 02:36:33.684

BUT THEY KNOW AS WE DO AND AS

02:36:43.293 --> 02:36:44.027
THIS COMMITTEE DOES THAT

02:36:44.094 --> 02:36:44.962
LEGISLATIVE INVOLVEMENT IN

02:36:45.028 --> 02:36:46.663
EVIDENTIARY MATTERS IS ENTIRELY

02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:48.332
APPROPRIATE WHEN A STRONG PUBLIC

02:36:48.398 --> 02:36:49.967

02:36:50.033 --> 02:36:51.502
AND THEY KNOW AS WE ALL DO THAT

02:36:51.568 --> 02:36:52.336
MATTERS OF PUBLIC HEALTH ARE

02:36:52.402 --> 02:36:53.604
CONSIDERED A VERY COMPELLING

OFTEN YOU KNOW WE WE WOULD

03:03:15.351 --> 03:03:16.585
PREFER NOT TO HAVE TO MANDATE

03:03:16.652 --> 03:03:19.888
BUT IN INSTANCES WHERE THERE ARE

03:03:19.955 --> 03:03:20.723
COUNTIES WHO HAVE FALLEN SHORT.

03:03:20.789 --> 03:03:22.091

I WOULD LIKE TO TO THE SECOND AT

LEAST A PORTION OF THAT I DON'T

03:05:37.960 --> 03:05:39.728
KNOW MY COUNTY STILL DOESN'T.

03:05:39.795 --> 03:05:41.730
BUT THEY OF ONE OF MY COUNTIES

03:05:41.797 --> 03:05:43.932
WOULD LET PEOPLE OUT TWELVE

03:05:43.999 --> 03:05:44.733
THIRTY ONE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT

03:05:44.800 --> 03:05:46.735
THEIR JAIL IS IN THE MIDDLE OF

NO WHERE.

03:05:47.736 --> 03:05:49.071

03:05:54.977 --> 03:05:56.812
THIS IS THE KIND OF ATTITUDE I

03:05:56.879 --> 03:05:58.146
THINK THAT MAKES PEOPLE REALLY

03:05:58.213 --> 03:06:00.182
QUESTION THE GOOD FAITH OF OUR

03:06:00.249 --> 03:06:02.150
LAW ENFORCEMENT SOMETIME SO I

03:06:02.217 --> 03:06:04.019
THINK IT REALLY BEHOOVES.

03:06:04.086 --> 03:06:05.954
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DEMONSTRATE.

03:06:06.021 --> 03:06:07.956
THAT IT ALSO HAS A LEVEL OF

03:06:08.023 --> 03:06:10.726
COMPASSION AND HUMANITY THAT ALL

03:06:10.792 --> 03:06:12.728
HUMAN BEINGS TO SERVE.

03:06:12.794 --> 03:06:13.762
AND WHEN THIS KIND OF THING

03:06:13.829 --> 03:06:16.265
HAPPENS I'M HOPING THAT WE HAVE

03:06:16.331 --> 03:06:18.800
STOPPED THAT PRACTICE IN.

03:06:18.867 --> 03:06:20.802
IN ONE OF MY COUNTIES.

03:06:20.869 --> 03:06:23.105
EACH TEACHER FROM THE EXIST AND

03:06:23.171 --> 03:06:24.506
IT REALLY DOES IT'S NOT

03:06:24.573 --> 03:06:26.575
SURPRISING THAT PEOPLE END UP

03:06:26.642 --> 03:06:28.043
HIT BY CARS FOR EXAMPLE MY

COMMUNITY ON THE ONE ã ONE

03:06:29.745 --> 03:06:31.580
FREEWAY THAT'S THE ONLY AVENUE

03:06:31.647 --> 03:06:33.282
THEY HAVE TO EVEN TRY TO CATCH A

03:06:33.348 --> 03:06:34.383
RIDE SOMEWHERE.

03:06:34.449 --> 03:06:35.984

I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED A HECK

03:06:44.560 --> 03:06:45.994
OF A LOT OF MONEY TO DO THEM BUT

03:06:46.061 --> 03:06:48.030
IT'S AN ATTITUDE IN AND AND AND

03:06:48.096 --> 03:06:50.799
OUTLOOK THAT I THINK.

WE DO NOT NEED.

03:07:17.926 --> 03:07:19.127
MISTER TURNER SHOULD NOT HAVE

03:10:12.834 --> 03:10:15.837
PRIMARY CARE GIVER WHILE WE ARE.

03:10:15.904 --> 03:10:17.873
CONCERNED OF COURSE ABOUT THOSE

03:10:17.939 --> 03:10:18.673
PEOPLE.

03:10:18.740 --> 03:10:19.941
OF A PARENT OR A CUSTODIAL

03:10:20.008 --> 03:10:21.910
INDIVIDUAL OF CHILDREN THIS

03:10:21.977 --> 03:10:23.478
COULD BE SOMEONE WHO IS THE

03:10:23.545 --> 03:10:25.881
PRIMARY CARE GIVER TO AN ELDERLY

03:10:25.947 --> 03:10:28.950
RELATIVE OR TO A DISABLED PERSON.

03:10:29.017 --> 03:10:31.119
AND THE POINT BEING IS THAT.

03:10:31.186 --> 03:10:33.622
WE CREATE GREAT COSTS TO THE

03:10:33.688 --> 03:10:34.923
STATE.

03:10:34.990 --> 03:10:37.793
WHEN WE HOLD PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:10:37.859 --> 03:10:39.861
OTHERWISE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

03:10:39.928 --> 03:10:41.229
CARE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO THEN

03:10:41.296 --> 03:10:43.298
HAVE NO ONE TO CARE FOR THEM?

03:10:43.365 --> 03:10:45.033
BUT EDITION WAVE WE TAKE

03:10:45.100 --> 03:10:47.402
CHILDREN THERE ARE VERY SEVERE

03:10:47.469 --> 03:10:50.172
CONSEQUENCES TO CHILDREN TO HAVE

03:10:50.238 --> 03:10:52.908
INCARCERATED PARENTS.

03:10:52.974 --> 03:10:55.010
ONLY 15% OF CHILDREN WITH

03:10:55.076 --> 03:10:56.778
INCARCERATED FATHER EVER EARN A

03:10:56.845 --> 03:10:58.880
COLLEGE DEGREE.

03:10:58.947 --> 03:11:00.315
ONLY 2% OF CHILDREN WITH

03:11:00.382 --> 03:11:02.017
INCARCERATED MOTHER EARN A

03:11:02.083 --> 03:11:04.352
COLLEGE DEGREE THAT'S COMPARED

03:11:04.419 --> 03:11:06.922
240% OF THE POPULATION AT LARGE.

03:11:06.988 --> 03:11:09.457
ALSO CHILDREN OF INCARCERATED

03:11:09.524 --> 03:11:10.392
PARENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO

03:11:10.458 --> 03:11:12.794
THEMSELVES BECOME INCARCERATED

03:11:12.861 --> 03:11:14.763
SO WE WANT TO BREAK THAT CYCLE

03:11:14.830 --> 03:11:17.332
IF IT IS POSSIBLE CLEARLY.

03:11:17.399 --> 03:11:20.802
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE A DANGER.

03:11:20.869 --> 03:11:22.838
TO OUR THE SOCIETY NEED TO BE

03:11:22.904 --> 03:11:24.673
INCARCERATED AND WE WERE IN WE

03:11:24.739 --> 03:11:26.708
WOULD NOT SEE SUCH AN AGREEMENT

03:11:26.775 --> 03:11:28.877
BY A JUDGE JUDY A AND P. D..

03:11:28.944 --> 03:11:30.045
THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED BY THIS

03:11:30.111 --> 03:11:31.847
BILL IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT

03:11:31.913 --> 03:11:33.415
CERTAINLY IF WE CAN ALLOW FOR

03:11:33.481 --> 03:11:35.016
DIVERSION IN APPROPRIATE

03:11:35.083 --> 03:11:37.219
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IS WHAT THE

03:11:37.285 --> 03:11:39.287
BILL IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE.

03:11:39.354 --> 03:11:41.022
SO WITH THAT I WILL ALLOW MY

03:11:41.089 --> 03:11:43.458
WITNESSES TO SPEAK.

03:11:43.525 --> 03:11:46.595
I HAVE -- ASHLEY CARTER.

03:11:46.661 --> 03:11:48.763
ASHLEY FOR QUALITY AND ASHLEY

03:11:48.830 --> 03:11:49.231
CARTER WHO IS FORMALLY

03:11:49.297 --> 03:11:51.800
INCARCERATED FOR DAUGHTER ASIA.

03:11:51.867 --> 03:11:53.935
WHO -- AS I MENTIONED IS THE

03:11:54.002 --> 03:11:57.138
DAUGHTER OF ASHLEY AND THEN --

03:11:57.205 --> 03:12:00.976
THOSE ARE MY WITNESSES.

03:12:01.042 --> 03:12:03.712
HI MY NAME IS ASIA AND MY FAMILY

03:12:03.778 --> 03:12:05.614
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME I DON'T

03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:06.748
KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT MY

03:12:06.815 --> 03:12:08.049
FAMILY AND I AM PROUD TO BE A

03:12:08.116 --> 03:12:09.284
CARD TO THOMAS AND I KNOW A LOT

03:12:09.351 --> 03:12:10.318
OF PEOPLE.

03:12:10.385 --> 03:12:11.820
WHO WOULD SAY THE SAME THING

03:12:11.887 --> 03:12:13.555
BECAUSE YOUR FAMILY WHO IS WHO

03:12:13.622 --> 03:12:15.290
YOU COULD TURN TO IN A CRISIS?

03:12:15.357 --> 03:12:16.625
WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD AND

03:12:16.691 --> 03:12:18.493
MY MOTHER WENT TO PRISON HAVING

03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:19.728
YOUR MOTHER TAKEN AWAY FROM THE

03:12:19.794 --> 03:12:21.529
SOMATIC REGARDLESS BUT IT'S EVEN

03:12:21.596 --> 03:12:23.465
WORSE WHEN YOU'RE ONLY?

03:12:23.531 --> 03:12:24.866
THREE GROWING UP I WOULD TRY TO

03:12:24.933 --> 03:12:26.568
RELATE TO OTHER KIDS BUT WHEN

03:12:26.635 --> 03:12:27.836
KIDS WE'LL FIND OUT MY PARENTS

03:12:27.903 --> 03:12:29.504
RAMPAGE AND I WILL GET BELIEVE

03:12:29.571 --> 03:12:30.805
AT EVERY SCHOOL I WENT.

03:12:30.872 --> 03:12:33.108
TO I AM VERY TRUSTING IN GENTLE

03:12:33.174 --> 03:12:34.843
IN PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:36.311
SO I WOULD SHARE MY STORY WITH

03:12:36.378 --> 03:12:37.946
MY SO CALLED FRIENDS AND THEY

03:12:38.013 --> 03:12:39.514
WOULD SAY THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD

03:12:39.581 --> 03:12:40.448
AND THEN THEY WOULD TURN AROUND

03:12:40.515 --> 03:12:42.083
IN THE MIDDLE CLASS AND SAY

03:12:42.150 --> 03:12:43.585
THAT'S WHY YOUR DAD IN PRISON.

03:12:43.652 --> 03:12:45.820
BECAUSE THEY KNEW WOULD HURT ME

03:12:45.887 --> 03:12:46.588
I WAS ONLY IN SECOND GRADE AT

03:12:46.655 --> 03:12:47.923
THE TIME.

03:12:47.989 --> 03:12:49.257
I WOULD GET SO EXCITED WHEN MY

03:12:49.324 --> 03:12:50.959
NANA WOULD TAKE ME TO GO SEE MY

03:12:51.026 --> 03:12:53.528
MOTHER WHEN I GOT THERE TO VISIT

03:12:53.595 --> 03:12:54.996
HER I WOULD RUN INTO HER ARMS

03:12:55.063 --> 03:12:58.066
AND SHE WOULD CALL ME SO TIGHT I

03:12:58.133 --> 03:12:58.333
COULDN'T.

03:12:58.400 --> 03:12:59.901
I ALMOST COULDN'T BE.

03:12:59.968 --> 03:13:01.036
THEN WE WOULD SIT DOWN AND TALK

03:13:01.102 --> 03:13:02.804
IN PLACE FLAPJACK CRAZY A SINGLE

03:13:02.871 --> 03:13:03.171
FISH.

03:13:03.238 --> 03:13:04.973
WE WOULD TAKE OUR PICTURES AND

03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:06.508
TALK SOME MORE BEFORE IT WAS

03:13:06.574 --> 03:13:08.310
TIME TO LEAVE.

03:13:08.376 --> 03:13:09.711
NO MATTER HOW LONG THE VISITS

03:13:09.778 --> 03:13:12.147
LASTED IT WAS NEVER ENOUGH TIME.

03:13:12.213 --> 03:13:13.682
THERE ISN'T EVER ENOUGH TIME IN

03:13:13.748 --> 03:13:14.816
THE WORLD WITH YOUR MOTHER I

03:13:14.883 --> 03:13:16.885
SUPPOSE SHE NOT ONLY A FEW HOURS

03:13:16.952 --> 03:13:19.087
EVERY THREE MONTHS IF THAT.

03:13:19.154 --> 03:13:20.722
AFTER VISITING THERE'S A FEELING

03:13:20.789 --> 03:13:22.257
THAT COMES OVER YOU WHEN YOU'RE

03:13:22.324 --> 03:13:23.558
WALKING THROUGH OUT THE GATE.

03:13:23.625 --> 03:13:24.893
LEAVING THE PRISON WALKING TO

03:13:24.960 --> 03:13:26.127
THE CAR AND WHEN YOU REALIZE

03:13:26.194 --> 03:13:27.996
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO AND YOUR

03:13:28.063 --> 03:13:29.564
PARENT IS COMING WITH YOU IT'S

03:13:29.631 --> 03:13:31.900
LIKE POURING SALT IN AN OPEN

03:13:31.967 --> 03:13:32.133
WOUND.

03:13:32.200 --> 03:13:34.135
WHEN MY MOM WAS GONE EVERYDAY

03:13:34.202 --> 03:13:35.704
THINGS THAT I WOULD NORMALLY DO

03:13:35.770 --> 03:13:36.471
WITH HER?

03:13:36.538 --> 03:13:38.606
INSTEAD I HAD TO DO IT BY MYSELF

03:13:38.673 --> 03:13:40.809
OR WITH MY NANA IN THAT WOULD

03:13:40.875 --> 03:13:41.009
HURT.

03:13:41.076 --> 03:13:41.743
BECAUSE CHILDREN NEED THEIR

03:13:41.810 --> 03:13:43.211
MOTHER AND IT'S BEEN THIS WAY

03:13:43.278 --> 03:13:45.714
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND

03:13:45.780 --> 03:13:46.348
THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN CHANGE

03:13:46.414 --> 03:13:47.215
THAT.

03:13:47.282 --> 03:13:48.283
I BELIEVE THAT IF MY MOM HAD AN

03:13:48.350 --> 03:13:49.718
OF WENT TO PRISON A LOT OF

03:13:49.784 --> 03:13:51.286
THINGS WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

03:13:51.353 --> 03:13:52.754
MAYBE SHE WAS THERE TO TELL ME I

03:13:52.821 --> 03:13:54.756
WAS PRETTY EVERY DAY LIKE I SEE

03:13:54.823 --> 03:13:55.924
HER DOING WITH MY LITTLE SISTER

03:13:55.991 --> 03:13:56.424
NOW.

03:13:56.491 --> 03:13:58.093
I WOULD HAVE BETTER SELF ESTEEM

03:13:58.159 --> 03:13:58.960
I WOULD THINK THAT I'M GOOD

03:13:59.027 --> 03:14:00.495
ENOUGH I WOULD THINK THAT I'M

03:14:00.562 --> 03:14:02.230
GOOD ENOUGH IN THAT IT'S OKAY TO

03:14:02.297 --> 03:14:04.099
BE MYSELF NO MATTER WHO'S AROUND

03:14:04.165 --> 03:14:05.166
INSTEAD OF HAVING TO HIDE MY

03:14:05.233 --> 03:14:05.533
TOOTH.

03:14:05.600 --> 03:14:06.901
IN MY TRUE FEELINGS IN ORDER TO

03:14:06.968 --> 03:14:08.269
BE ACCEPTED.

03:14:08.336 --> 03:14:09.938
OUR RELATIONSHIP AND OUR BOND

03:14:10.005 --> 03:14:11.306
WOULD BE STRONGER YOU WOULD KNOW

03:14:11.373 --> 03:14:12.974
SO MUCH MORE ABOUT EACH OTHER

03:14:13.041 --> 03:14:14.275
AND WE WILL GET ALONG MORE.

03:14:14.342 --> 03:14:14.976
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE

03:14:15.043 --> 03:14:17.879
NIGHTMARES OF GOING TO PRISON

03:14:17.946 --> 03:14:18.113
MYSELF.

03:14:18.179 --> 03:14:19.948
MY MOM DIDN'T KNOW ME WHEN SHE

03:14:20.015 --> 03:14:21.216
CAME HOME AND I DIDN'T KNOW HER

03:14:21.282 --> 03:14:22.751
AND WE'RE STILL LEARNING THINGS

03:14:22.817 --> 03:14:24.386
ABOUT EACH OTHER EVERY DAY.

03:14:24.452 --> 03:14:26.054
WE BOTH KIND OF ROMANTICIZED A

03:14:26.121 --> 03:14:28.256
REUNIFICATION THAT'LL BE EASIER

03:14:28.323 --> 03:14:29.557
AND CLEANER BUT THAT'S THE THING

03:14:29.624 --> 03:14:31.860
ABOUT REUNIFICATION IT'S MESSY

03:14:31.926 --> 03:14:33.962
SENATE AND HARD BUT IT'S WORTH

03:14:34.029 --> 03:14:35.196
IT.

03:14:35.263 --> 03:14:37.999
NO MATTER WHAT WE NEED ARE MOM.

03:14:38.066 --> 03:14:38.967
YOUR MOM TO BE THERE WHEN YOU

03:14:39.034 --> 03:14:39.934
FALL OFF YOUR BIKE WHICH GRAY

03:14:40.001 --> 03:14:41.136
PUNY OR IF YOU'RE GETTING

03:14:41.202 --> 03:14:42.404
BULLIED AT SCHOOL.

03:14:42.470 --> 03:14:44.339
YOUR MOM IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE

03:14:44.406 --> 03:14:45.774
BUT IF YOU TAKE THAT AWAY YOU OF

03:14:45.840 --> 03:14:47.042
NOTHING THE PERSON BEING

03:14:47.108 --> 03:14:48.743
CONVICTED AND GOING TO PRISON

03:14:48.810 --> 03:14:50.145
ISRAEL ISN'T THE ONLY ONE THAT

03:14:50.211 --> 03:14:51.079
HAS TO SUFFER.

03:14:51.146 --> 03:14:52.480
FROM DEALING WITH THE CRIMINAL

03:14:52.547 --> 03:14:53.548
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

03:14:53.615 --> 03:14:54.983
AND IF THE PEOPLE THAT LOVE THEM

03:14:55.050 --> 03:14:56.651
THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR FRIENDS

03:14:56.718 --> 03:14:58.186
AND ESPECIALLY THEIR CHILDREN I

03:14:58.253 --> 03:15:00.188
HOPE THAT THIS BILL PASSES

03:15:00.255 --> 03:15:01.423
SELECT CHANGE SO MANY LIVES AND

03:15:01.489 --> 03:15:02.857
KEEP OTHER KIDS FROM

03:15:02.924 --> 03:15:04.793
EXPERIENCING THE SAME KIND OF

03:15:04.859 --> 03:15:05.860
PAIN THANK YOU [inaudible]

03:15:05.927 --> 03:15:10.565
RICHARD.

03:15:10.632 --> 03:15:12.467
HELLO MY NAME IS ASHLEY CARTER --

03:15:12.534 --> 03:15:21.009
I'M FORMERLY INCARCERATED WOMAN.

03:15:21.076 --> 03:15:23.378
VERY NEAR AND DEAR.

03:15:23.445 --> 03:15:27.549
YEAH THANK YOU.

03:15:27.615 --> 03:15:28.883
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AS I

03:15:28.950 --> 03:15:36.157
CAN GET THROUGH A TEST.

03:15:36.224 --> 03:15:37.425
I DON'T THINK THAT I AM UNIQUE

03:15:37.492 --> 03:15:38.893
IN THE SENSE THAT WHEN MY

03:15:38.960 --> 03:15:42.630
DAUGHTER ASIA WAS BORN.

03:15:42.697 --> 03:15:44.866
I HELD HER IN MY ARMS LOOKED HER

03:15:44.933 --> 03:15:45.900
IN HER EYES.

03:15:45.967 --> 03:15:47.735
AND FOR HER THAT I WOULD PROTECT

03:15:47.802 --> 03:15:53.575
HER WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING.

03:15:53.641 --> 03:15:55.110
I PROMISED HER THAT SHE HAD

03:15:55.176 --> 03:15:57.612
NOTHING TO BE OF IT UP.

03:15:57.679 --> 03:15:59.147
BECAUSE MAMA WOULD TAKE CARE OF

03:15:59.214 --> 03:16:01.049
HER AND NEVER LEAVE HER SIDE.

03:16:01.116 --> 03:16:04.886
AND I LIED.

03:16:04.953 --> 03:16:06.488
WHEN ANGEL WAS EIGHT MONTHS OLD

03:16:06.554 --> 03:16:07.789
HER FATHER AND I WERE INDICTED

03:16:07.856 --> 03:16:09.824
ON DRUG CHARGES?

03:16:09.891 --> 03:16:12.127
I WAS FACING TEN YEARS I HAD NO

03:16:12.193 --> 03:16:13.862
PRIOR CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS AND I

03:16:13.928 --> 03:16:14.963
HAD NEVER BEEN MORE SCARED IN MY

03:16:15.029 --> 03:16:17.332
LIFE.

03:16:17.398 --> 03:16:18.766
THE THOUGHT OF ME HAVING TO

03:16:18.833 --> 03:16:21.269
LEAVE MY DAUGHTER TERRIFIED ME.

03:16:21.336 --> 03:16:23.805
WHAT PARENT EVER DREAMS OF NEVER

03:16:23.872 --> 03:16:24.873
BEING ABLE TO HOLD THEIR CHILD

03:16:24.939 --> 03:16:26.074
AGAIN?

03:16:26.141 --> 03:16:26.608
MAKE THEM PANCAKES IN THE

03:16:26.674 --> 03:16:30.979
MORNING.

03:16:31.045 --> 03:16:31.913
I TEACH THEM HOW TO TIE THEIR

03:16:31.980 --> 03:16:34.749
SHOES -- OR EVEN SCOLD THEM FOR

03:16:34.816 --> 03:16:35.750
NOT CLEANING THE ROOM LIKE

03:16:35.817 --> 03:16:36.885
YOU'VE ASKED THEM TO DO A

03:16:36.951 --> 03:16:39.988
HUNDRED TIMES THAT DAY.

03:16:40.054 --> 03:16:41.055
THOSE WERE THE SCENARIOS THAT

03:16:41.122 --> 03:16:42.991
WOULD PLAY OUT OF MY HEAD ON A

03:16:43.057 --> 03:16:43.892
DAILY BASIS.

03:16:43.958 --> 03:16:45.226
I WOULD WATCH HER GROW TRYING MY

03:16:45.293 --> 03:16:47.529
HARDESTTO TAKE AS MANY MENTAL

03:16:47.595 --> 03:16:49.998
SNAPSHOTS AS I POSSIBLY COULD

03:16:50.064 --> 03:16:51.699
KNOWING THAT ONE DAY.

03:16:51.766 --> 03:16:53.101
ALL I WOULD HAVE OF MY DAUGHTER

03:16:53.168 --> 03:16:56.437
WOULD BE THOSE MEMORIES.

03:16:56.504 --> 03:16:57.805
I SPENT THE SUBSEQUENT THREE

03:16:57.872 --> 03:16:59.174
YEARS FIGHTING FOR NOT ONLY MY

03:16:59.240 --> 03:17:00.775
LIFE BEFORE MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE

03:17:00.842 --> 03:17:02.310
AS WELL.

03:17:02.377 --> 03:17:03.211
I WAS DETERMINED TO SHOW THE

03:17:03.278 --> 03:17:05.747
COURTS THAT I KNEW I HAD MESSED

03:17:05.813 --> 03:17:07.549
UP AND I WAS NOT ONLY WILLING.

03:17:07.615 --> 03:17:09.450
BUT I WAS ABLE AND DETERMINED TO

03:17:09.517 --> 03:17:12.954
DO THE RIGHT THING. TO SOMEHOW

03:17:13.021 --> 03:17:14.355
PROVE THAT EVEN THOUGH I HAD

03:17:14.422 --> 03:17:16.758
MADE THESE BAD CHOICES I WAS NOT

03:17:16.824 --> 03:17:19.160
A BAD PERSON.

03:17:19.227 --> 03:17:20.795
MY LIFE UP UNTIL I BECAME A

03:17:20.862 --> 03:17:22.797
MOTHER HAD BEEN FILLED WITH

03:17:22.864 --> 03:17:23.531
CHAOS.

03:17:23.598 --> 03:17:26.034
POVERTY UNCERTAINTY POOR CHOICES

03:17:26.100 --> 03:17:28.203
AND ABUSE PERMEATED MY DAILY

03:17:28.269 --> 03:17:29.871
EXISTENCE.

03:17:29.938 --> 03:17:31.906
I HAD NO CLUE WHO I WAS OUTSIDE

03:17:31.973 --> 03:17:33.908
OF THOSE DYNAMICS.

03:17:33.975 --> 03:17:35.643
I WAS COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED

03:17:35.710 --> 03:17:38.146
NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF.

03:17:38.213 --> 03:17:39.614
BUT FROM ANY SENSE OF FAMILY

03:17:39.681 --> 03:17:42.083
PURPOSE AND COMMUNITY.

03:17:42.150 --> 03:17:43.084
THERE WAS A MUCH IN LIFE THAT I

03:17:43.151 --> 03:17:44.819
CARED ABOUT BECAUSE MY LIFE

03:17:44.886 --> 03:17:46.154
EXPERIENCE UP UNTIL THAT POINT

03:17:46.221 --> 03:17:47.255
HAD TAUGHT ME THAT NOT MUCH IN

03:17:47.322 --> 03:17:50.058
LIFE CARED ABOUT ME.

03:17:50.124 --> 03:17:52.527
BUT THAT'S NOT WHO I WAS ANYMORE.

03:17:52.594 --> 03:17:54.162
I WORK TWO JOBS TO PROVIDE FOR

03:17:54.229 --> 03:17:55.430
MY DAUGHTER AND MY MOTHER WAS

03:17:55.496 --> 03:17:56.531
DISABLED AND LIVING WITH US AT

03:17:56.598 --> 03:17:58.833
THE TIME.

03:17:58.900 --> 03:17:59.801
I QUICKLY BECAME A RECOGNIZED

03:17:59.867 --> 03:18:01.402
EMPLOYEE AND BEGAN MOVING UP THE

03:18:01.469 --> 03:18:02.537
RANKS WITHIN THE COMPANY FROM MY

03:18:02.604 --> 03:18:04.639
WORKED.

03:18:04.706 --> 03:18:06.074
I THOUGHT THEIR OPINION ATTENDED

03:18:06.140 --> 03:18:07.909
REGULARLY I ENROLLED IN

03:18:07.976 --> 03:18:10.345
COSMETOLOGY SCHOOL.

03:18:10.411 --> 03:18:11.613
AN INDUSTRY THAT I HAVE ALWAYS

03:18:11.679 --> 03:18:13.248
BEEN PASSIONATE ABOUT BUT NEVER

03:18:13.314 --> 03:18:14.315
HAD ENOUGH FAITH IN MYSELF TO

03:18:14.382 --> 03:18:16.985
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH.

03:18:17.051 --> 03:18:18.386
NOT NOT ONLY DID I EXCEL

03:18:18.453 --> 03:18:20.488
PROFESSIONALLY AND ACADEMICALLY

03:18:20.555 --> 03:18:22.123
BUT ALSO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED

03:18:22.190 --> 03:18:23.958
ELECTRONIC MONITORING DRUG

03:18:24.025 --> 03:18:25.393
TESTING AND COMPLIED WITH EVERY

03:18:25.460 --> 03:18:27.495
OTHER PRE TRIAL STIPULATION WITH

03:18:27.562 --> 03:18:29.097
NOT ONE SINGLE VIOLATION IN

03:18:29.163 --> 03:18:31.299
THREE YEARS.

03:18:31.366 --> 03:18:32.934
I COMPILED LETTERS OF SUPPORT

03:18:33.001 --> 03:18:34.435
FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY

03:18:34.502 --> 03:18:35.870
AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT I WORKED

03:18:35.937 --> 03:18:37.205
WITH PETITIONING THE COURTS TO

03:18:37.272 --> 03:18:38.906
ALLOW ME TO REMAIN AT HOME TO

03:18:38.973 --> 03:18:40.108
CARE FOR MY DAUGHTER AND MOTHER.

03:18:40.174 --> 03:18:42.210
POLICE OFFICERS EVEN SHOWED UP

03:18:42.277 --> 03:18:43.845
TO MY HEARINGS IN SUPPORT.

03:18:43.911 --> 03:18:46.014
IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE.

03:18:46.080 --> 03:18:47.148
ALTHOUGH I HAD COMPLETELY

03:18:47.215 --> 03:18:49.350
CHANGED MY LIFE FOR THE COURTS

03:18:49.417 --> 03:18:51.819
IT WAS TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.

03:18:51.886 --> 03:18:52.487
I WAS TOLD THEY COULDN'T LET ME

03:18:52.553 --> 03:18:53.521
GET AWAY.

03:18:53.588 --> 03:18:55.990
I HAD TO PAY FOR WHAT I HAD DONE.

03:18:56.057 --> 03:18:57.225
THE REALITY OF THE MATTER IS I

03:18:57.292 --> 03:18:59.060
WASN'T THE ONLY ONE THAT ENDED

03:18:59.127 --> 03:19:01.429
UP PAYING WITH THAT SENTENCE.

03:19:01.496 --> 03:19:02.463
UPON GOING TO PRISON MY MOTHER

03:19:02.530 --> 03:19:03.898
AND DAUGHTER BECAME EASY TARGETS

03:19:03.965 --> 03:19:05.600
FOR HOME INVASION.

03:19:05.667 --> 03:19:06.934
MY MOTHER WAS TIED UP AND BEATEN

03:19:07.001 --> 03:19:08.236
FRONT OF MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS

03:19:08.303 --> 03:19:08.870
BEING RESTRAINED WITH THE GUN TO

03:19:08.936 --> 03:19:11.205
HER HEAD.

03:19:11.272 --> 03:19:12.473
THIS BECAME WORD THIS BECAUSE

03:19:12.540 --> 03:19:14.208
WORD ON THE STREETS WAS THAT I

03:19:14.275 --> 03:19:15.677
HAD WENT TO PRISON FOR SELLING

03:19:15.743 --> 03:19:15.910
DRUGS.

03:19:15.977 --> 03:19:17.145
SO THERE HAVE TO BE STASHES OF

03:19:17.211 --> 03:19:19.213
MONEY IN THE HOUSE.

03:19:19.280 --> 03:19:20.381
AFTER THE HOME INVASION MY

03:19:20.448 --> 03:19:21.849
MOTHER AND DAUGHTER WERE NO

03:19:21.916 --> 03:19:23.751
LONGER ABLE TO STAY IN THAT HOME.

03:19:23.818 --> 03:19:24.986
MY MOTHER WHO WAS NOW DEALING

03:19:25.053 --> 03:19:26.087
WITH THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL

03:19:26.154 --> 03:19:27.989
ISSUES STEMMING FROM THE ATTACK

03:19:28.056 --> 03:19:29.223
WAS FORCED TO MOVE INTO A LOCAL

03:19:29.290 --> 03:19:31.092
SHELTER WITH MY DAUGHTER.

03:19:31.159 --> 03:19:32.427
HERE AT THE SHELTER MY DAUGHTER

03:19:32.493 --> 03:19:34.395
WAS AGAIN VICTIMIZED BY ANOTHER

03:19:34.462 --> 03:19:36.597
RESIDENT OF THE FACILITY.

03:19:36.664 --> 03:19:38.733
HERE I WAS THE MOTHER WHO LOOKED

03:19:38.800 --> 03:19:41.035
INTO HER BABY SITES.

03:19:41.102 --> 03:19:43.871
AND SWORE TO PROTECT HER.

03:19:43.938 --> 03:19:44.739
WITH NO NO WHERE TO BE FOUND

03:19:44.806 --> 03:19:50.478
DURING MOST VULNERABLE MOMENT.

03:19:50.545 --> 03:19:51.346
I HAD LET THE MONSTERS GET.

03:19:51.412 --> 03:19:55.616
AB.

03:19:55.683 --> 03:19:56.284
AND THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO

03:19:56.351 --> 03:19:57.318
ABOUT IT.

03:19:57.385 --> 03:20:00.254
I WAS POWERLESS.

03:20:00.321 --> 03:20:01.556
I SHARE THESE STORIES WITH YOU

03:20:01.622 --> 03:20:03.324
TODAY BECAUSE BOTH OF THE WICKS

03:20:03.391 --> 03:20:05.059
THAT I CARRY WITH ME EVERY DAY.

03:20:05.126 --> 03:20:07.128
THE PAIN AND THE GUILT OF HOW

03:20:07.195 --> 03:20:07.762
DIFFERENT HER LIFE COULD HAVE

03:20:07.829 --> 03:20:08.930
BEEN.

03:20:08.996 --> 03:20:09.564
IF I COULD HAVE JUST BEEN THERE

03:20:09.630 --> 03:20:11.866
FOR HER.

03:20:11.933 --> 03:20:13.067
THE DESTRUCTION AND HURT THE

03:20:13.134 --> 03:20:14.402
SEPARATION DUE TO INCARCERATION

03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:16.838
CAUSES CANNOT EVER ADEQUATELY BE

03:20:16.904 --> 03:20:18.840
DESCRIBED WITH WORDS.

03:20:18.906 --> 03:20:20.942
THIS PAIN IS ONE THAT I CAN ONLY

03:20:21.008 --> 03:20:22.577
COMPARE TO DEATH BECAUSE ON SO

03:20:22.643 --> 03:20:24.045
MANY LEVELS EVERYONE INVOLVED

03:20:24.112 --> 03:20:26.047
SUFFERS SO MUCH LOSS.

03:20:26.114 --> 03:20:28.516
ANY REPROBATE DAMAGE.

03:20:28.583 --> 03:20:30.051
WHEN I WAS RELEASED I HAD NO

03:20:30.118 --> 03:20:30.985
IDEA THAT THE HARDEST PART OF

03:20:31.052 --> 03:20:32.720
OUR SEPARATION WOULD LAY BEFORE

03:20:32.787 --> 03:20:34.021
US?

03:20:34.088 --> 03:20:34.922
I NO LONGER KNEW WHO MY CHILD

03:20:34.989 --> 03:20:36.791
WHAT.

03:20:36.858 --> 03:20:38.893
WE WERE STRANGERS.

03:20:38.960 --> 03:20:40.161
IMAGINE NOT KNOWING YOUR CHILD'S

03:20:40.228 --> 03:20:41.829
TEACHERS NAME WHAT THEIR

03:20:41.896 --> 03:20:43.531
FAVORITE COLOR IS OR SOMETHING

03:20:43.598 --> 03:20:45.133
AS SIMPLE AS NOT KNOWING HOW TO

03:20:45.199 --> 03:20:46.401
MAKE A PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY

03:20:46.467 --> 03:20:48.703
SANDWICH THE WAY THEY LIKE.

03:20:48.770 --> 03:20:50.338
THE ATTACHMENT WAS A BY PRODUCT

03:20:50.405 --> 03:20:52.140
OF INCARCERATION BECAUSE I KNEW

03:20:52.206 --> 03:20:54.542
NO OTHER WAY TO GET TROUGH THE

03:20:54.609 --> 03:20:55.676
PAIN OF NOT THE SCENE.

03:20:55.743 --> 03:20:57.578
HOLDING OR WATCHING MY DAUGHTER

03:20:57.645 --> 03:20:59.914
GROW UP ON A DAY BY DAY BASIS

03:20:59.981 --> 03:21:02.884
THAN TO DETACH MYSELF FROM HER.

03:21:02.950 --> 03:21:04.152
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE STILL

03:21:04.218 --> 03:21:05.787
DEAL WITH TO THIS DAY.

03:21:05.853 --> 03:21:07.655
THE EFFECTS OF MY INCARCERATION

03:21:07.722 --> 03:21:10.124
ON OUR FAMILY ARE STILL REELING

03:21:10.191 --> 03:21:11.859
SIX YEARS POST RELEASE.

03:21:11.926 --> 03:21:13.127
AND IF I'M BEING TOTALLY HONEST

03:21:13.194 --> 03:21:14.729
WITH YOU I'M NOT SURE WHEN THEY

03:21:14.796 --> 03:21:16.564
WILL EVER GO AWAY.

03:21:16.631 --> 03:21:18.466
A BILL FOR JUST THREE NINETY

03:21:18.533 --> 03:21:19.867
FOUR WOULD WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME

03:21:19.934 --> 03:21:21.669
THE VERY OPPORTUNITY SAID I WAS

03:21:21.736 --> 03:21:23.538
TRYING SO DESPERATELY. TO PROVE

03:21:23.604 --> 03:21:27.008
TO THE COURTS I WAS WORTHY OF I

03:21:27.074 --> 03:21:29.644
WASN'T ASKING TO GET OFF SCOT

03:21:29.710 --> 03:21:29.844
FREE.

03:21:29.911 --> 03:21:31.979
I WAS JUST ASKING FOR A CHANCE

03:21:32.046 --> 03:21:33.781
TO PROVE THAT I WAS CAPABLE OF

03:21:33.848 --> 03:21:34.949
MORE.

03:21:35.016 --> 03:21:36.951
THAT I WAS WORTHY OF MORE.

03:21:37.018 --> 03:21:40.888
AND THAT SHE WAS WORTHY OF MORE.

03:21:40.955 --> 03:21:42.924
A LIFE WITH A LITTLE LESS RAUMA.

03:21:42.990 --> 03:21:43.524
