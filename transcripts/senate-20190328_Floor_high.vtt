MEDICAL BENEFITS OF CANNABIS IS

00:54:14.017 --> 00:54:15.919
BECAUSE IT REMAINS A SCHEDULE

ONE DRUG WHICH MEANS IT'S VERY

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.355
DIFFICULT TO DO RESEARCH IN THE

PAID ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHT CENTS

00:59:04.073 --> 00:59:05.875
FOR EVERY DOLLAR A MAN MAKES.

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:07.377

00:59:39.042 --> 00:59:40.810
MALE.

00:59:40.877 --> 00:59:42.478
THIS ISN'T JUST A PROBLEM THAT

00:59:42.545 --> 00:59:44.047
AFFECTS WOMEN AS I MENTIONED

00:59:44.113 --> 00:59:46.115
FAMILIES.

00:59:46.182 --> 00:59:48.117
OUR IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY

00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:49.185
THIS BECAUSE WOMEN ARE IN THE

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:51.087
WORKFORCE TODAY IN GREATER

00:59:51.154 --> 00:59:52.722
NUMBERS THAN EVER BEFORE AND ARE

00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:54.891
IN THE WORKFORCE BECAUSE THEIR

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:58.561
INCOME IS NECESSARY FOR FAMILIES

00:59:58.628 --> 00:59:58.828
TO MAKE.

00:59:58.895 --> 01:00:01.998
ENDS MEET THAT MONEY STAYS IN

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:04.133
OUR COMMUNITY THAT MONEY

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.501
PURCHASES THE GOODS IN THE

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:07.704

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:08.838
LIFE.

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:09.872
THAT FAMILIES NEED.

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.441
AND CONTRARY TO WHAT SOME

01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:13.076
BELIEVE THIS IS NOT A GAP THAT

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:15.545
CAN BE EXPLAINED AWAY SIMPLY BY

01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:16.913
WOMEN'S LIFE CHOICES.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.214
IT'S A GAP THAT EXISTS

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:20.583
REGARDLESS OF THE INDUSTRY WOMAN

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:22.185
WORKS IN.

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:23.386
WHETHER IT'S NURSING OR

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.421
MANUFACTURING IT'S A GAP THAT

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:29.292
EXISTS REGARDLESS OF A WOMAN.

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:30.793
TO OUR EDUCATIONAL LEVEL.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.161
WOMEN WITH MASTER'S DEGREES ARE

01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:34.130
STILL PAID LESS THAN MEN WITH

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:35.665
THE SAME DEGREE.

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:38.001
WOMEN WITH DOCTORAL DEGREES HAVE

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:39.569
BEEN SHOWN TO BE PAID LESS THAN

01:00:39.635 --> 01:00:42.038
MEN WITH MASTER'S DEGREES.

THREE EXTRA MONTHS BEFORE WE

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:06.929

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:09.532
FOR THE PRIOR YEAR.

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:10.967

ECONOMIC SECURITY.

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:30.286
I AM VERY PROUD THAT WE WERE

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:31.521
ABLE TO PASS.

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:34.223
IN THIS LEGISLATURE BACK IN

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:35.024

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.206
DONE.

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:52.241
BECAUSE A LIFETIME OF LOWER PAY

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:54.977
MEANS WOMEN HAVE LESS INCOME. TO

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:56.646

HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD OR WHATEVER

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:20.488

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:22.223
VISITING EVERY HISTORICAL

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:23.625

WHICH WAS A SERIES BACK THEN IN.

01:24:46.147 --> 01:24:46.714
NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THAT WAS

01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:48.450
JUST SUCH A FOCAL POINT FOR MY

01:24:48.516 --> 01:24:49.117
DAD.

01:24:49.184 --> 01:24:50.251
BUT ONE OF THE FUN THINGS ABOUT

01:24:50.318 --> 01:24:52.153
MY DAD WAS THAT HE TALKED TO

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.321
EVERYBODY.

01:24:53.388 --> 01:24:55.023

ENGAGE IN.

01:24:57.725 --> 01:25:00.028
AND SOMETIMES WE GO.

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:03.064
WHAT'S TO NETWORK RIGHT IF YOU

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:04.399
KNOW THESE PEOPLE.

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:05.533
IT WAS SORT OF A RUNNING KIND OF

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.267
THING BUT HERE WE ARE AS ADULTS

01:25:06.334 --> 01:25:06.901

01:25:06.968 --> 01:25:08.136
FUN.

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:09.370
AND THEN FOR SOME OF US WITHOUT

01:25:09.437 --> 01:25:10.872
SOMETIMES YOU MAYBE MAYBE HE WAS

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:12.173
A LITTLE DISTANT WHEN WE WERE.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.442
TOGETHER BUT I THINK THAT MADE

01:25:14.509 --> 01:25:15.810
