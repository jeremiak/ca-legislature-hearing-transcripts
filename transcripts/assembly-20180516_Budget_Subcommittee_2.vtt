AROUND GOVERNMENTS AROUND

00:41:50.375 --> 00:41:54.379 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WE THINK A

YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTED

00:41:54.379 --> 00:41:56.614 region:rollup2
TO EFFECTIVE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE

WE'VE BEEN COMMITTED TO A

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:59.650 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WE THINK

00:41:57.648 --> 00:42:01.619 region:rollup2
THE TRAILER BILL REFLECTS OF

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:04.522 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THOSE I COMMITMENTS.

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:06.891 region:rollup2

00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:13.664 region:rollup2
.

00:42:12.163 --> 00:42:15.333 region:rollup2
HOW HOW DOES THE MAY REVISE?

00:42:13.664 --> 00:42:17.602 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE

00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:19.270 region:rollup2
OF THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:42:17.602 --> 00:42:21.639 region:rollup2
HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM THE.

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:24.475 region:rollup2
INITIAL PROPOSAL.

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:26.611 region:rollup2
AS SO UNDER THE INITIAL PROPOSAL

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:28.079 region:rollup2
AND A NEW DISTRICT WOULD BE

00:42:26.611 --> 00:42:29.781 region:rollup2
CREATED WITH THE NEW INDEPENDENT

00:42:28.079 --> 00:42:31.249 region:rollup2
GOVERNING BOARD OF THE BOARD OF

00:42:29.781 --> 00:42:32.550 region:rollup2
GOVERNORS WHAT'S THAT. WOULD

00:42:31.249 --> 00:42:35.219 region:rollup2
SERVE AS THE INTERIM.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.687 region:rollup2
BOARD UNTIL THE AND YOU

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:38.389 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT BOARD IS A POINT AND

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:39.490 region:rollup2
I'M UNDER THAT UNDER THE MAYOR

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:42.960 region:rollup2
VISION PROPOSAL THE BOARD OF

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:44.462 region:rollup2
GOVERNORS WOULD SERVE AS AT. THE

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:46.064 region:rollup2
GOVERNING BOARD OF THE ONLINE

00:42:44.462 --> 00:42:47.832 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:50.201 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT'S STILL A NEW.

00:42:47.832 --> 00:42:51.869 region:rollup2
COLLEGE THEN IT'S A NEW DISTRICT

00:42:50.201 --> 00:42:54.038 region:rollup2
IT'S STILL A NEW DISTRICT THAT.

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:54.872 region:rollup2
CORRECT IT WOULD BE AND IT WOULD

00:42:54.038 --> 00:42:57.642 region:rollup2
BE NEW COLLEGE.

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:59.544 region:rollup2
AND FOR PURPOSES OF THE STATUTE

00:42:57.642 --> 00:43:03.181 region:rollup2
WE WOULD DEFINE AT THE COLLEGE

00:42:59.544 --> 00:43:05.383 region:rollup2
ALLIES AT A DISTRICT AS WELL.

00:43:03.181 --> 00:43:07.151 region:rollup2
IT WOULDN'T SEEK ACCREDITATION.

00:43:05.383 --> 00:43:09.086 region:rollup2
IT WOULD SEEK ACCREDITATION

00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:09.787 region:rollup2
OKAY I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:11.923 region:rollup2
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE

00:43:09.787 --> 00:43:14.492 region:rollup2
INITIAL PROPOSAL.

00:43:11.923 --> 00:43:16.761 region:rollup2
AT THE THOSE GOVERNING BOARD.

00:43:14.492 --> 00:43:18.896 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THAT PORTER GOVERNOR'S

00:43:16.761 --> 00:43:19.497 region:rollup2
RIGHT MOVING FORWARD.

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:20.865 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE INITIAL

00:43:19.497 --> 00:43:22.700 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

00:43:20.865 --> 00:43:24.936 region:rollup2
THAT THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OUT

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:26.637 region:rollup2
WOULD SERVE IN AN INTERIM ROLE

00:43:24.936 --> 00:43:29.440 region:rollup2
UNTIL AN APPOINTMENT UP AT

00:43:26.637 --> 00:43:30.775 region:rollup2
SEPARATE BOARD OUT WOULD BE AND

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.376 region:rollup2
UP APPOINTED AND OTHER HIGHER

00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:34.278 region:rollup2
VERSION THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:35.179 region:rollup2
WAS GONNA POINT ANOTHER BOARD.

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:37.115 region:rollup2
AND NOW THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:39.117 region:rollup2
WOULD RUN THIS ON MY COLLEAGUES

00:43:37.115 --> 00:43:39.784 region:rollup2
ARE SAYING AND AT CORRECT THAT

00:43:39.117 --> 00:43:41.953 region:rollup2
THERE WAS.

00:43:39.784 --> 00:43:43.554 region:rollup2
AT STATUE THAT'S BY THE BY THE

00:43:41.953 --> 00:43:45.423 region:rollup2

GOVERNORS WHICH TO SERVE AS.

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:52.930 region:rollup2
BUT NOT NOT NOT AS AN INTERIM

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:54.398 region:rollup2
BUT INDEFINITE CORRECT.

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:56.567 region:rollup2
IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH PROP

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:58.569 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT FUNDING GOING TO A

00:43:56.567 --> 00:44:03.374 region:rollup2

CHRIS ORGASM APPLYING THE WITH

00:44:04.909 --> 00:44:07.845 region:rollup2
FINANCE WE BELIEVE THAT.

00:44:06.511 --> 00:44:09.146 region:rollup2
THE STRUCTURE OF THE TRAILER

BILL WITH SUCH THAT THIS COLLEGE

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:12.049 region:rollup2

PROPOSITION NINETY.

00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:15.620 region:rollup2
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE

WE BELIEVE THAT WE.

00:44:20.892 --> 00:44:24.328 region:rollup2
WHAT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO IS

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.531 region:rollup2
THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS IT'S PART

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:27.532 region:rollup2
OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM

00:44:26.531 --> 00:44:31.369 region:rollup2
WHICH IS PART OF THE PUBLIC

00:44:27.532 --> 00:44:32.970 region:rollup2

THE MISSION OF.

00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:51.249 region:rollup2
OF PROVIDING.

00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:53.217 region:rollup2
SKILLS RIGHT TO CLOSE MAYBE

00:45:51.249 --> 00:45:54.085 region:rollup2
SOME SKILL GAPS IT'S NOT TO

OFFER GENERAL EDUCATION.

00:45:54.085 --> 00:45:58.322 region:rollup2

SO IT IS. IN THIS CAN BE LIKE A

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:05.096 region:rollup2
ONE STOP SHOP.

TAKE AN ONLINE CLASS IS THAT

00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:11.902 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

00:46:10.334 --> 00:46:13.571 region:rollup2
I'VE THE ONLY COLLEGE WOULD

00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:15.940 region:rollup2
DESIGN A SPECIFIC.

00:46:13.571 --> 00:46:19.143 region:rollup2
A CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.744 region:rollup2
THE MEDICAL CODEINE AND THE IT

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:21.112 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

00:46:19.744 --> 00:46:23.180 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON SPECIFIC.

00:46:21.112 --> 00:46:26.050 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY AT NEED SO THAT WOULD

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:27.852 region:rollup2
BE FOCUS SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS I

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:28.753 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK ANYONE SUPPOSED TO.

00:46:27.852 --> 00:46:30.655 region:rollup2
CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS OR

00:46:28.753 --> 00:46:32.256 region:rollup2
DRESSING.

00:46:30.655 --> 00:46:33.658 region:rollup2
REALLY ECONOMIC NEEDS ACROSS THE

00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:35.293 region:rollup2
STATE WITH YOU KNOW PROVIDING

00:46:33.658 --> 00:46:36.761 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS MORE SKILLS.

00:46:35.293 --> 00:46:38.095 region:rollup2
SO THIS DE IN THE IDEAS THAT

00:46:36.761 --> 00:46:39.063 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE IDEAS NOW

00:46:38.095 --> 00:46:40.097 region:rollup2
CONCEPTS WHERE YOU'D GO WITH

00:46:39.063 --> 00:46:42.433 region:rollup2
THIS BUT THAT IT WOULD EXPAND

00:46:40.097 --> 00:46:43.234 region:rollup2
OVER TIME.

00:46:42.433 --> 00:46:45.202 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF VISION.

00:46:43.234 --> 00:46:47.104 region:rollup2
RIGHT I THINK THERE'S A TIME

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:48.806 region:rollup2
FRAME WHERE AT THE COLLEGE WOULD

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:49.607 region:rollup2
INITIALLY DEVELOP THREE PATHWAYS

00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:51.475 region:rollup2
AND THEN THREE ADDITIONAL

00:46:49.607 --> 00:46:52.977 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND

00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:55.246 region:rollup2
AGAIN THESE ARE SHORT TERM.

00:46:52.977 --> 00:46:57.048 region:rollup2
CREDENTIALS AT THAT LEAD TO A

00:46:55.246 --> 00:46:58.783 region:rollup2
PROMOTION AND OR WAGE GAINS

00:46:57.048 --> 00:46:59.850 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES BUT THE IDEA

00:46:58.783 --> 00:47:02.286 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE COLLEGE WOULD

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:04.655 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO. ADD DEVELOP AT

00:47:02.286 --> 00:47:05.423 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND DESIGNED AROUND

00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:08.726 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC.

00:47:05.423 --> 00:47:10.227 region:rollup2
WORK FOURS AT NEEDS AND CLOSING

00:47:08.726 --> 00:47:13.564 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC GAPS.

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:14.665 region:rollup2
THIS IS ONE PLACE YOU GO TO.

00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:17.268 region:rollup2
TO TAKE CLASSES TO.

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:20.104 region:rollup2
THERE.

00:47:17.268 --> 00:47:21.572 region:rollup2
GAIN THOSE NECESSARY SKILLS.

00:47:20.104 --> 00:47:22.306 region:rollup2
SO SO I GOT ALL I JUST STRUGGLE

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:24.075 region:rollup2
THIS LITTLE BIT IS.

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:25.042 region:rollup2
DO

00:47:24.075 --> 00:47:27.378 region:rollup2
DO WE HAVE THOSE CLASSES NOW

00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:27.878 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE.

00:47:27.378 --> 00:47:30.047 region:rollup2
COLLEGES NOW OFFER THOSE

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:32.683 region:rollup2
CLASSES.

00:47:30.047 --> 00:47:34.652 region:rollup2
I AM SO A COUPLE OF OF AND AREAS

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:37.188 region:rollup2
WHERE THIS COLLEGES WHAT WILL BE

00:47:34.652 --> 00:47:39.523 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT HAD THEN THE EXISTING

00:47:37.188 --> 00:47:41.192 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE. I'M OF THE

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:42.827 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE COLLEGES THE ON MY

00:47:41.192 --> 00:47:44.395 region:rollup2
COLLEGE WOULD DEVELOP I'M

00:47:42.827 --> 00:47:45.329 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WITH THEIRS AND NEED.

00:47:44.395 --> 00:47:47.365 region:rollup2
WHERE?

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:49.200 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE IS A

00:47:47.365 --> 00:47:50.134 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY FOR I'M INDIVIDUALS

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.669 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO PROMOTE AND

00:47:50.134 --> 00:47:53.838 region:rollup2
INCREASE THEIR WAGE GAIN AWARE

00:47:51.669 --> 00:47:55.906 region:rollup2
THAT NEED AS AN BEING AT MATT'S.

00:47:53.838 --> 00:47:57.742 region:rollup2
THAT COLLEGE WOULD ALSO DEVELOP

00:47:55.906 --> 00:47:59.744 region:rollup2
COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION.

00:47:57.742 --> 00:48:01.579 region:rollup2
AND OFFER AND COURSES THAT ARE

00:47:59.744 --> 00:48:04.148 region:rollup2
NIGHT TIED TO THE TYPICAL

00:48:01.579 --> 00:48:04.849 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC AND CALENDAR STILL AND

00:48:04.148 --> 00:48:06.984 region:rollup2
THE DESIGN.

00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:08.686 region:rollup2
OF OF THESE PROGRAMS WILL BE A

00:48:06.984 --> 00:48:10.254 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND WE DID

00:48:08.686 --> 00:48:12.223 region:rollup2
ADD SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE

00:48:10.254 --> 00:48:13.657 region:rollup2
TRAILER BILL TO ENSURE THAT I

00:48:12.223 --> 00:48:15.593 region:rollup2
LESSONS LEARNED IT BY.

00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:17.027 region:rollup2
THE COLLEGE WOULD BE SHARED

00:48:15.593 --> 00:48:19.230 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE OTHER COMMITTEE

00:48:17.027 --> 00:48:21.432 region:rollup2
COLLEGES ON HOW TO BEST SERVE

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:24.301 region:rollup2
OUT WORKING ADULTS THAT ARE.

00:48:21.432 --> 00:48:25.636 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY ATTENDING AND THICK

00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:26.871 region:rollup2
THE TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY THIS.

00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:28.405 region:rollup2
SIDE I DON'T OPPOSE THE GO THE

00:48:26.871 --> 00:48:29.240 region:rollup2
GOAL. I'M JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED

00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:31.175 region:rollup2
ON WHY THIS IS THE WAY TO GET

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.309 region:rollup2
THERE WE HAVE ALL THESE COLLEGES

00:48:31.175 --> 00:48:33.911 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE.

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:35.546 region:rollup2
WHY WOULDN'T WE CREATE A ONE

00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:37.381 region:rollup2
STOP SHOP A ONE IN A ONE ONE

00:48:35.546 --> 00:48:38.616 region:rollup2
WEBSITE?

00:48:37.381 --> 00:48:40.117 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HAVE ALL THESE

00:48:38.616 --> 00:48:41.352 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CLASSES LISTA BECAUSE

00:48:40.117 --> 00:48:42.553 region:rollup2
THERE'S DIFFERENT SCHOOLS SKITS

00:48:41.352 --> 00:48:43.788 region:rollup2
SKILLSETS ACROSS OUR STATE

00:48:42.553 --> 00:48:44.622 region:rollup2
DINNER REGION'S THAT NEED

00:48:43.788 --> 00:48:47.491 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SKILL SETS.

00:48:44.622 --> 00:48:48.492 region:rollup2
.

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:49.727 region:rollup2
SO SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY YOU

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:50.895 region:rollup2
JUST WOULDN'T.

00:48:49.727 --> 00:48:52.062 region:rollup2
HAVE THESE COLLEGES DEVELOP

00:48:50.895 --> 00:48:53.430 region:rollup2
THESE NOW OR EVEN IF THEY OFFER

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:54.932 region:rollup2
THEM NOW.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:56.500 region:rollup2
AND HAVE THEM COLLECTED ON ONE

00:48:54.932 --> 00:48:58.369 region:rollup2
WEBSITE ARE THE ON ONE WEBSITE

NOW. HELP ME I DON'T UNDER I

00:48:58.369 --> 00:49:02.907 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW SEVEN SAY IN GENERAL.

00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:04.642 region:rollup2
WE ARE TARGETING AREAS WHERE.

00:49:02.907 --> 00:49:06.210 region:rollup2
COLLEGE ME COLLEGES MAY OFFER

00:49:04.642 --> 00:49:07.077 region:rollup2
SIMILAR PROGRAMS I THINK IT'S

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:09.013 region:rollup2
FINANCE INDICATED.

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:10.581 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AREN'T OFFERING THESE

00:49:09.013 --> 00:49:11.749 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IN A COMPETENCY BASED

00:49:10.581 --> 00:49:13.350 region:rollup2
FORMAT I THINK THAT'S AN

00:49:11.749 --> 00:49:13.617 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PROPOSAL

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:14.552 region:rollup2
WE THINK.

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:15.920 region:rollup2
.

00:49:14.552 --> 00:49:18.389 region:rollup2
CAN WE THINK IT HELPS REDUCE THE

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:20.090 region:rollup2
FRICTION THAT STUDENTS NEED.

00:49:18.389 --> 00:49:21.358 region:rollup2
THAT STUDENTS OFTEN FACE AND I

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:23.594 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO GET ACCESS TO THE

00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:23.928 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT LEAD TO WAGE GAINS

00:49:23.594 --> 00:49:24.962 region:rollup2
IN EMPLOYMENT.

00:49:23.928 --> 00:49:26.931 region:rollup2
.

00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:27.898 region:rollup2
I THINK IN GENERAL THE SCALE

00:49:26.931 --> 00:49:29.533 region:rollup2
ISN'T THERE I THINK YOU KNOW

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:30.968 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR OAKLEY HAS BEEN VERY

00:49:29.533 --> 00:49:32.169 region:rollup2
CLEAR THAT THE.

00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:33.504 region:rollup2
GOAL OF THIS IN PART IS TO

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:35.472 region:rollup2
CREATE AN INSTITUTION THAT CAN

00:49:33.504 --> 00:49:37.575 region:rollup2
DELIVER INSTRUCTION AT SCALE TO

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:38.943 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO. A CAN OF STRANDED

00:49:37.575 --> 00:49:39.176 region:rollup2
WORKERS WERE FACING THIS NEED SO

00:49:38.943 --> 00:49:40.845 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:49:39.176 --> 00:49:41.812 region:rollup2
.

00:49:40.845 --> 00:49:42.313 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE SKILLED A

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:43.781 region:rollup2
DAY.

00:49:42.313 --> 00:49:45.282 region:rollup2
I THINK A QUESTION IS COULD YOU

00:49:43.781 --> 00:49:47.651 region:rollup2
BUILD SCALE AND THE EXISTING

00:49:45.282 --> 00:49:49.119 region:rollup2
COLLEGES WE THINK BE APPROACH IS

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:50.955 region:rollup2
PREFERABLE TO BUILD IT IN A NEW

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:52.423 region:rollup2
COLLEGE WHERE YOU CAN DESIGNED

00:49:50.955 --> 00:49:53.691 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE NEEDS OF

00:49:52.423 --> 00:49:54.391 region:rollup2
THE USE THAT BUT THIS POPULATION

00:49:53.691 --> 00:49:57.995 region:rollup2
OF LEARNERS.

00:49:54.391 --> 00:49:59.530 region:rollup2
CURRENT.

00:49:57.995 --> 00:50:00.331 region:rollup2
AMERICA WOULD JUST HAVE A BIG

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:00.998 region:rollup2
PROBLEM ASSEMBLY MEMBER DONNA

00:50:00.331 --> 00:50:03.434 region:rollup2
YOUR QUESTION THE BIGGER PART OF

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:04.768 region:rollup2
WHAT I THINK WE FEE OF A.

00:50:03.434 --> 00:50:06.070 region:rollup2
A DIFFICULT PATH PART OF

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:07.605 region:rollup2
EVALUATING THE PROPOSALS THAT A

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:08.639 region:rollup2
LOT OF THINGS HERE AND DEPENDING

00:50:07.605 --> 00:50:10.074 region:rollup2
ON WHAT YOU THINK OF THE MORE

00:50:08.639 --> 00:50:11.842 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT GOAL YOU WOULD TAKE TO

00:50:10.074 --> 00:50:12.443 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT APPROACH SO. I THINK

00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:13.410 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS CAN

00:50:12.443 --> 00:50:14.845 region:rollup2
WE.

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:16.146 region:rollup2
FIND A BETTER WAY TO SORT OF

00:50:14.845 --> 00:50:17.715 region:rollup2
COLLECT ONLINE PROGRAM TO MAKE

00:50:16.146 --> 00:50:18.382 region:rollup2
IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO ENROLL

00:50:17.715 --> 00:50:20.384 region:rollup2
IN THESE PROGRAMS ALL ACROSS THE

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:21.519 region:rollup2
STATE. BECAUSE YOU'RE CORRECT

00:50:20.384 --> 00:50:24.088 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE ONLY ON LIKE.

00:50:21.519 --> 00:50:24.688 region:rollup2
COURSES ALL ALL ACROSS THE STATE

00:50:24.088 --> 00:50:26.657 region:rollup2
ENTIRE PROGRAMS MIGHT NOT BE

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:28.425 region:rollup2
ONLINE THEY'RE AVAILABLE WE HAVE

00:50:26.657 --> 00:50:30.327 region:rollup2
A SYSTEM THAT DOES THAT. THAT IS

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:31.829 region:rollup2
NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY BECAUSE

00:50:30.327 --> 00:50:33.530 region:rollup2
IT IT WERE STILL REQUIRES

00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:35.432 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL COLLEGES ARE

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:36.867 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS TAXI BUT YOU CAN GO

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:38.168 region:rollup2
ONLINE FIND OF COURSE CLICK ON

00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:40.537 region:rollup2
AND YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE

00:50:38.168 --> 00:50:41.739 region:rollup2
COLLEGE TO. A SUBMIT SUBMIT

00:50:40.537 --> 00:50:43.674 region:rollup2
INFORMATION TO YOU CAN VERIFY

00:50:41.739 --> 00:50:45.009 region:rollup2
YOUR ENROLLMENT AND IN GENERAL

00:50:43.674 --> 00:50:46.510 region:rollup2
YOU CAN JUST SEEM IF WE DO THAT.

00:50:45.009 --> 00:50:47.144 region:rollup2
IF WE CREATE THAT ON MY COLLEGE

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.178 region:rollup2
DOES NOT GONNA PICK THEM EVENT

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:49.380 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO CREATE ANOTHER

00:50:48.178 --> 00:50:51.515 region:rollup2
WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN GO TO FIND

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.316 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM SO IF THAT'S THE

00:50:51.515 --> 00:50:53.984 region:rollup2
GOAL THAT'S ONE ASPECT.

00:50:52.316 --> 00:50:55.586 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE WAY THIS PROPOSAL

00:50:53.984 --> 00:50:57.488 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN ITS THIRD MORE ABOUT IF

00:50:55.586 --> 00:50:59.223 region:rollup2
NOT ABOUT THAT ITS ABOUT WORKING

00:50:57.488 --> 00:51:00.524 region:rollup2
ADULTS AGE WHO WHO NEED

00:50:59.223 --> 00:51:01.058 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS. THAT YOU

00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:02.293 region:rollup2
MIGHT THINK IT'S WHOLLY

00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:03.460 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT APPROACH YOU MIGHT

00:51:02.293 --> 00:51:05.229 region:rollup2
THINK OKAY WELL WE WE REALLY

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:06.864 region:rollup2
WANT A COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAM

00:51:05.229 --> 00:51:07.498 region:rollup2
LET'S FOCUS ON THAT LET'S.

00:51:06.864 --> 00:51:08.132 region:rollup2
FIGURE HOW TO DO THAT I THINK WE

00:51:07.498 --> 00:51:09.166 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO

00:51:08.132 --> 00:51:10.067 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:11.268 region:rollup2
YOU WANT IT YOU MIGHT WANT FOR

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:12.536 region:rollup2
MORE OPTIONS THAN JUST CREATING

00:51:11.268 --> 00:51:14.104 region:rollup2
A NEW ENTITY THAT CAN HAVE A FEW

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:15.773 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK

00:51:14.104 --> 00:51:16.907 region:rollup2
ABOUT POLICY CHANGES ACROSS THE.

00:51:15.773 --> 00:51:17.975 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM THAT WOULD

00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:19.276 region:rollup2
IMPROVE IT BUT AGAIN IT DEPENDS

00:51:17.975 --> 00:51:20.978 region:rollup2
ON WHAT YOUR GOAL IS THAT WHAT

00:51:19.276 --> 00:51:22.179 region:rollup2
YOU THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT.

00:51:20.978 --> 00:51:23.681 region:rollup2
BIG FOCUS ON THIS IS KIND OF

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:25.416 region:rollup2
FUN TO DO MANY THINGS THAT WERE

00:51:23.681 --> 00:51:26.817 region:rollup2
NOT ALWAYS YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON

00:51:25.416 --> 00:51:28.385 region:rollup2
THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:29.420 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IT'S WIDEN ASPECT OF

00:51:28.385 --> 00:51:32.156 region:rollup2
MORE PUTTING THEM UP IN THE

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.756 region:rollup2
OTHER. YEAH HIT THE WAY I'M

00:51:32.156 --> 00:51:33.023 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THIS WE ARE TO HAVE

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:34.158 region:rollup2
THE WILL.

00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:35.759 region:rollup2
I WAS THE THE HUB.

00:51:34.158 --> 00:51:37.761 region:rollup2
AND I I SEE THEM CREATING A NEW

00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:38.562 region:rollup2
WHEEL AND A NEW HUB.

00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:40.965 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY I'M STRUGGLING WITH

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:42.700 region:rollup2
THIS AND I I BELIEVE THEY HAVE A

00:51:40.965 --> 00:51:43.801 region:rollup2
COMPOSITION NOW TO DO THIS.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.436 region:rollup2
IT PROBABLY AN EVEN MUCH MORE

00:51:43.801 --> 00:51:46.403 region:rollup2
TIMELY MANNER AND WE'RE CREATING

00:51:45.436 --> 00:51:48.172 region:rollup2
A NEW BUREAUCRACY A NEW

00:51:46.403 --> 00:51:49.106 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION. WHEN YOU HAVE TO

00:51:48.172 --> 00:51:50.441 region:rollup2
PLAY OVER HERE WHAT COULD YOU

00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:51.875 region:rollup2
WHO JUST HAVE ONE PLACE YOU

00:51:50.441 --> 00:51:53.010 region:rollup2
COULD APPLY QUITE FRANKLY ONE

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:54.778 region:rollup2
PLACE YOU APPLY FOR ALL

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:56.013 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE COLLEGES IN THE STATE.

00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:57.982 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU COULD ACCESS ALL

00:51:56.013 --> 00:51:59.183 region:rollup2
THOSE CLASSES ON THE WHEEL AS

00:51:57.982 --> 00:52:01.652 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO AGAIN REINVENTING.

00:51:59.183 --> 00:52:02.786 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE NEW.

00:52:01.652 --> 00:52:04.955 region:rollup2
APPROACH AND THEN THEY'D BE

00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:05.789 region:rollup2
STILL BE SEPARATE.

00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:07.825 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT REALLY IS

00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:10.661 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING.

00:52:07.825 --> 00:52:11.862 region:rollup2
NOT. A GOOD ANYONE COMMENT DID

00:52:10.661 --> 00:52:13.998 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST SAY I I

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:15.132 region:rollup2
THINK WE. WE COULD HAVE THE

00:52:13.998 --> 00:52:16.467 region:rollup2
WHEEL I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE

00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:17.201 region:rollup2
WHEEL TODAY SO I THINK THE

00:52:16.467 --> 00:52:18.736 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT THAT.

00:52:17.201 --> 00:52:20.938 region:rollup2
MANY MAKE IS THAT YOU COULD

00:52:18.736 --> 00:52:21.438 region:rollup2
BUILD OUT THESE TYPES OF COURSES

00:52:20.938 --> 00:52:23.407 region:rollup2
AT SKILLED THE EXISTING

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:24.441 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

00:52:23.407 --> 00:52:27.144 region:rollup2
I THINK WE THINK IT'S A

00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:29.079 region:rollup2
COMBINATION OF OF ALL OF THE

00:52:27.144 --> 00:52:31.615 region:rollup2
ABOVE THAT. ON THE EXISTING

00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:33.550 region:rollup2
COURSES IN WHAT WE CALL THE.

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:34.685 region:rollup2
A WE AYE OUR ONLINE EDUCATION

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:36.587 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE.

00:52:34.685 --> 00:52:37.821 region:rollup2
I THINK WE YOU KNOW WE AGREE

00:52:36.587 --> 00:52:38.856 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO THE

00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:40.424 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CALLS OUT

00:52:38.856 --> 00:52:42.393 region:rollup2
THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO TO BUILD

00:52:40.424 --> 00:52:42.960 region:rollup2
THOSE INTO ASSOCIATE DEGREE

00:52:42.393 --> 00:52:44.928 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS.

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:46.196 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WILL BE DOING THAT

00:52:44.928 --> 00:52:48.198 region:rollup2
WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY I THINK

00:52:46.196 --> 00:52:49.867 region:rollup2
THERE'S THIS GAP OF WHERE ARE

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:51.502 region:rollup2
THE COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAMS

00:52:49.867 --> 00:52:53.070 region:rollup2
THAT MEET THE NEEDS ARE FOR

00:52:51.502 --> 00:52:54.238 region:rollup2
WORKING LEARNERS. THAT'S

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:54.705 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE THINK THE

00:52:54.238 --> 00:52:56.740 region:rollup2
ONLINE.

00:52:54.705 --> 00:52:57.474 region:rollup2
NOT BE ONLINE COLLEGE WILL HELP

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.509 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS

00:52:57.474 --> 00:52:59.777 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE

00:52:58.509 --> 00:53:01.178 region:rollup2
OUT AND AND PART OF WHAT THE

00:52:59.777 --> 00:53:03.247 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALSO OF A

00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:04.481 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. SUGGESTS IS THAT HOW

00:53:03.247 --> 00:53:06.517 region:rollup2
DOES THIS NEW ONLINE COLLEGE

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:08.218 region:rollup2
FEED INTO A PATHWAY IN OUR

00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:09.620 region:rollup2
EXISTING COLLEGES SO I THINK ALL

00:53:08.218 --> 00:53:11.789 region:rollup2
OF THE STRATEGIES ARE THINGS

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:13.691 region:rollup2
THAT. WE AGREEMENT SENSE WE

00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:15.492 region:rollup2
THINK ESTABLISHING A NEW ONLINE

00:53:13.691 --> 00:53:16.827 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT

00:53:15.492 --> 00:53:17.294 region:rollup2
PART OF KIND OF THAT OVERALL

00:53:16.827 --> 00:53:19.063 region:rollup2
STRATEGY AROUND ONLINE

00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:20.464 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

00:53:19.063 --> 00:53:21.865 region:rollup2
AROUND EDUCATION FOR WORKING

00:53:20.464 --> 00:53:23.567 region:rollup2

WHAT THEY TOLD ME LOOKS LIKE

00:53:34.645 --> 00:53:38.549 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AGAIN IF WE HAVE

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:40.050 region:rollup2
CAPACITY AROUND THE STATE.

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:41.718 region:rollup2
AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:44.154 region:rollup2

I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW I'VE I

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:56.680 region:rollup2
THINK WERE WE'RE PROBABLY RIGHT

00:56:54.645 --> 00:56:59.349 region:rollup2
I REIMAGINE AND AS PART OF OUR

00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:00.217 region:rollup2
DESIGN PROCESS WE RECOGNIZE THAT

00:56:59.349 --> 00:57:02.252 region:rollup2
IN PERSON.

00:57:00.217 --> 00:57:04.054 region:rollup2
CONNECTIONS MATTER THAT A LOT

00:57:02.252 --> 00:57:04.554 region:rollup2
OF YOU KNOW WE HELD THE DESIGN

00:57:04.054 --> 00:57:06.590 region:rollup2
SESSION.

00:57:04.554 --> 00:57:07.925 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A FEW MONTHS AGO AND

00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:09.359 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE BIG THINGS WE LEARNED

00:57:07.925 --> 00:57:11.228 region:rollup2
FROM OTHER FOLKS WHO DO WORK IN

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:12.429 region:rollup2
THE SPACE IS THAT YOU NEED TO

00:57:11.228 --> 00:57:14.698 region:rollup2
KIND OF COACHING AND MENTORING

00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:16.533 region:rollup2
IS A BIG PART OF THIS WORK IN

00:57:14.698 --> 00:57:17.467 region:rollup2
THAT YOU NEED. BOTH KIND OF WELL

00:57:16.533 --> 00:57:19.169 region:rollup2
SO COACHING AND MENTORING IS

00:57:17.467 --> 00:57:20.337 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND SO CAN IF HAVING A

00:57:19.169 --> 00:57:22.372 region:rollup2
ROLE THERE THAT.

00:57:20.337 --> 00:57:23.473 region:rollup2
MAYBE IS FACE TO FACE BUT I

00:57:22.372 --> 00:57:25.208 region:rollup2
THINK IN MANY CASES THE HOUSE

00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:27.844 region:rollup2
HOW WILL THAT COACHING AND

00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:31.615 region:rollup2
MENTORING WORK. IN PERSON OR YOU

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:32.449 region:rollup2
TAXING SOMEBODY ON YOUR ANDROID.

00:57:31.615 --> 00:57:33.984 region:rollup2
PHONE AT THREE IN THE MORNING

00:57:32.449 --> 00:57:35.585 region:rollup2
WHO'S MAYBE LIVES IN FLORIDA I

00:57:33.984 --> 00:57:36.687 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S A SO NOT IN

00:57:35.585 --> 00:57:37.321 region:rollup2
FLORIDA I THINK WE'VE MADE A

00:57:36.687 --> 00:57:39.323 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT THAT.

00:57:37.321 --> 00:57:40.891 region:rollup2
IT OUT THAT THESE THAT THE

00:57:39.323 --> 00:57:43.260 region:rollup2
STAFF IS BASED IN CALIFORNIA.

00:57:40.891 --> 00:57:45.228 region:rollup2
BUT I DO THINK THAT PART OF.

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:46.330 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:48.098 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT COACHING MENTORING

00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:49.900 region:rollup2
WORKS WELL ONLINE AND WE THINK

00:57:48.098 --> 00:57:51.168 region:rollup2
IN MANY CASES IT WORKS BETTER

00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:52.436 region:rollup2
ONLINE YEAH.

00:57:51.168 --> 00:57:53.603 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOES SPACE DON'T SEE

00:57:52.436 --> 00:57:54.604 region:rollup2
STARTED RISK RESPECTFULLY NOT

00:57:53.603 --> 00:57:58.041 region:rollup2
ANSWER EITHER OF YOU ARE WELL

00:57:54.604 --> 00:58:00.210 region:rollup2
WILL BE. A PHYSICAL IN PERSON

00:57:58.041 --> 00:58:01.945 region:rollup2
PLACE WHERE STUDENTS CAN ENGAGE

PERSON INTERACTION THAT WE

00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:12.149 region:rollup2

WE'VE SEEN EXAMPLES IN OTHER

00:59:12.149 --> 00:59:16.720 region:rollup2
CONTEXTS. OF WAYS IN WHICH FOLKS

00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:17.854 region:rollup2
DO THAT ONLINE I THINK THE.

00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.222 region:rollup2
A PLACE WHERE A LOT OF UP IN OUR

00:59:17.854 --> 00:59:21.324 region:rollup2
DESIGN PROCESS A LOT OF THE IN

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:23.527 region:rollup2
PERSON INTERACTION. IS NOT

00:59:21.324 --> 00:59:25.562 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY BETWEEN TENTATIVE

00:59:23.527 --> 00:59:26.730 region:rollup2

COHORTS OF STUDENTS WHO ARE

00:59:30.834 --> 00:59:33.003 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE

00:59:31.468 --> 00:59:33.737 region:rollup2
TOGETHER. TO HAVE A SUPPORT

NETWORK TO.

00:59:33.737 --> 00:59:36.873 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THIS FEASIBLE AND SO

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:38.241 region:rollup2
WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

00:59:36.873 --> 00:59:39.976 region:rollup2

BUILD A SENSE OF COMMUNITY. A

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.283 region:rollup2
LOT OF WHAT WE'VE.

00:59:44.481 --> 00:59:46.750 region:rollup2
DON IS KIND OF I THINK CRITICAL

00:59:46.283 --> 00:59:48.518 region:rollup2
TO THIS.

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:50.020 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IS THE PARTNERSHIPS

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:52.055 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE HAD WITH EMPLOYERS

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:54.658 region:rollup2
AND WITH TOM LABOR ORGANIZATIONS

00:59:52.055 --> 00:59:56.460 region:rollup2
UNIONS OUT TO FIND EMPLOYEES AT

00:59:54.658 --> 00:59:58.562 region:rollup2
THEIR WORK SPACES. DESIGNED

00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:59.463 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION THAT IS RELEVANT TO

00:59:58.562 --> 01:00:01.097 region:rollup2
THEM IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE.

00:59:59.463 --> 01:00:03.767 region:rollup2
BOTH KIND OF.

EMPLOYMENT AND ACHIEVE EARNINGS

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.969 region:rollup2
GAINS IN THAT.

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:07.838 region:rollup2
AND THAT WORK ENVIRONMENT SO I

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:09.172 region:rollup2
THINK. THAT THE STRUCTURE THAT

01:00:07.838 --> 01:00:11.141 region:rollup2
WE'VE DESIGNED FOR A PER FIRST

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:12.676 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS IS CAN WE DESIGN

01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:14.811 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS WHERE WE HAVE A SET OF

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:15.712 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES WHO WITH ADDITIONAL

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:17.180 region:rollup2
SKILLS.

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:18.115 region:rollup2
COULD ACHIEVE SOME TYPE OF A

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:20.350 region:rollup2
LABOR MARKET OUTCOME THAT WE

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:22.319 region:rollup2
THINK IS IMPORTANT.

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.819 region:rollup2
OKAY I'M NOT.

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:24.254 region:rollup2
QUITE CERTAIN THAT THAT

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:25.455 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:26.990 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT ISSUE BUT BUT

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:28.525 region:rollup2
I'LL MOVE ON.

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:30.193 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE THAT THE

01:00:28.525 --> 01:00:32.028 region:rollup2
BARGAINING ISSUE FOR IT FOR THE

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:32.496 region:rollup2
FACULTY.

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:33.864 region:rollup2
HOW WILL THAT WORK IS

01:00:32.496 --> 01:00:34.397 region:rollup2
APPARENTLY?

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:35.665 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'D HAVE TO ABBOTT

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:37.701 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:39.135 region:rollup2
DO THE BARGAINING FOR THE NEW

01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:41.271 region:rollup2
CAMPUS WHICH IS RUN BY THE BOARD

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:42.639 region:rollup2
OF GOVERNORS YEAH THAT HOW THAT

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:44.508 region:rollup2
ALL THE CIVIC ONE OF THE

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:45.442 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT WE HAD HEARD ABOUT

01:00:44.508 --> 01:00:47.444 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S AYE JANUARY

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:48.578 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL WAS AMBIGUITY AROUND.

01:00:47.444 --> 01:00:50.046 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN THE

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:51.882 region:rollup2
INTERIM SO I THINK WHAT THE

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:53.783 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES.

01:00:51.882 --> 01:00:54.885 region:rollup2
HIS PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY THAT

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:56.319 region:rollup2
ONE THIS COLLEGES ESTABLISHED

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:57.521 region:rollup2
THERE'S A PROCESS FOR COLLECTIVE

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:59.356 region:rollup2
BARGAINING UNDER EXISTING

01:00:57.521 --> 01:01:01.224 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING LAWS. AND

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:02.926 region:rollup2
SO THE OUR ONLINE COLLEGE WE

01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:04.294 region:rollup2
CONTRACT WITH THE DISTRICT THE

01:01:02.926 --> 01:01:05.061 region:rollup2
DISTRICT WOULD SERVICE THE PARTY

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:06.096 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF.

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:07.898 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING COLLECTIVE

01:01:06.096 --> 01:01:09.199 region:rollup2
BARGAINING LAWS AND THE ONLINE

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:11.101 region:rollup2
COLLEGE WOULD APPEAR TO BE OF

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:11.902 region:rollup2
THE TERMS OF THAT AGREEMENT.

01:01:11.101 --> 01:01:14.871 region:rollup2
AND WERE THESE BE.

01:01:11.902 --> 01:01:16.907 region:rollup2
PART TIME FACULTY POSITIONS.

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:18.241 region:rollup2
THEIR FULL TIME FACULTY I THINK

01:01:16.907 --> 01:01:19.176 region:rollup2
WE HAVE MADE A CLEAR COMMITMENT

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:21.244 region:rollup2
THAT WE WILL HAVE FULL TIME

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:23.213 region:rollup2
FACULTY OF THE COLLEGE.

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:24.714 region:rollup2
ALL OF THEM. I NOT ALL OF THEM

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:25.515 region:rollup2
IN THE THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:26.750 region:rollup2
BILL SUGGESTS THAT THERE WOULD

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:28.151 region:rollup2
BE A COMBINATION OF FULL TIME

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:29.653 region:rollup2
AND PART TIME BUT WE HAD

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:30.487 region:rollup2
EXPECTED HER TO THE SOFA.

01:01:29.653 --> 01:01:31.388 region:rollup2
TO THE RIGHT ARE THE

01:01:30.487 --> 01:01:31.621 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS OF LAWLER AROUND

01:01:31.388 --> 01:01:33.156 region:rollup2
HOW WE.

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.924 region:rollup2
.

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:36.159 region:rollup2
HOW WE ADMINISTER?

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:37.661 region:rollup2
A FACULTY SYSTEM THAT HAS BOTH

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:38.828 region:rollup2
PART TIME FULL TIME. AND THEN

01:01:37.661 --> 01:01:40.564 region:rollup2

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:41.264 region:rollup2
CONCERN EARLIER.

01:01:40.564 --> 01:01:42.866 region:rollup2
I THINK MISTER DON ABOUT A

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:44.668 region:rollup2
COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:46.603 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS WHERE THE FACULTY

01:01:44.668 --> 01:01:48.104 region:rollup2
MEMBERS WHO WOULD BE.

01:01:46.603 --> 01:01:50.106 region:rollup2

DO YOU ENFORCE THAT.

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:57.581 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

01:01:56.613 --> 01:01:59.282 region:rollup2
THAT WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO WORK

01:01:57.581 --> 01:02:00.550 region:rollup2

BUDGET WE THINK THIS IS THE BEST

01:03:26.436 --> 01:03:28.905 region:rollup2
WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT OUTCOME.

01:03:27.037 --> 01:03:31.241 region:rollup2

ON LITTLE CONFUSED ON THE

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:38.882 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.583 region:rollup2
STILL ON ON GOVERNANCE AND

01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:43.053 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

TRUSTEES.

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:48.358 region:rollup2
THE.

01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:48.925 region:rollup2
BOARD OF GOVERNORS.

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:49.826 region:rollup2
RIGHT BOARD OF GOVERNORS WHO

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:51.761 region:rollup2
WOULD ACT.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:53.897 region:rollup2
AS.

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:56.633 region:rollup2
TRUSTEES FOR THIS NEW COLLEGE

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:58.401 region:rollup2
CORRECT. AT CREDIT RIGHT.

01:03:56.633 --> 01:04:01.071 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD HIRE PRESIDENT.

01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:02.572 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:03.139 region:rollup2
AND THAT PRESIDENT WOULD BE ON A

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:05.475 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:07.510 region:rollup2
CAMPUS.

01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:09.479 region:rollup2
I KNOW OR HE WOULD BE WHERE.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:10.380 region:rollup2
THAT I.

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:13.550 region:rollup2
THAT PRESIDENT WOULD BE THE

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:14.017 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:15.085 region:rollup2
AND WHERE WOULD HE BE

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:17.420 region:rollup2
PHYSICALLY.

01:04:15.085 --> 01:04:18.054 region:rollup2
.

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.122 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT CAN DETERMINE

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:20.557 region:rollup2
THE UP.

01:04:19.122 --> 01:04:22.125 region:rollup2
LET'S YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:24.194 region:rollup2
THE THE HEADQUARTERS OF THIS

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:26.196 region:rollup2
OPERATION WOULD BE LOCATED.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:28.765 region:rollup2
BUT THIS THE FACULTY WOULD

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:31.167 region:rollup2
BARGAIN WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:34.037 region:rollup2
A PARTNER DISTRICT THE COLLEGE

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:36.406 region:rollup2
BUT CONTRACT WAITED A PARTNER

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:37.974 region:rollup2
AYE IN EXISTING PARTNER DISTRICT

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:39.209 region:rollup2
TO ESTABLISH A COLLECTIVE

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:40.877 region:rollup2
BARGAINING AGREEMENT FOR THE

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:42.812 region:rollup2
FACULTY OF THE COLLEGE WITH

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:44.247 region:rollup2
ANOTHER DISTRICT. AT CORRECT THE

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:45.782 region:rollup2
OTHER DISTRICT IN EXISTING TO AN

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:47.984 region:rollup2
EXISTING DISTRICT SO FAR

01:04:45.782 --> 01:04:50.053 region:rollup2
UNSPECIFIED.

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:52.422 region:rollup2
CORRECT DO YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:53.957 region:rollup2
OF IT OF THE. DISTRICT.

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:58.461 region:rollup2
FOR COLLEGE WHO REALLY DOESN'T

01:04:53.957 --> 01:04:59.996 region:rollup2
BARGAIN WITH HIS OWN FACULTY.

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:02.665 region:rollup2
ARE NOT DIRECTLY UNDER THE UNDER

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:04.667 region:rollup2
THE TERMS OF THE LAW.

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:06.369 region:rollup2
SO SO THE BARGAINING MEMBERS OF

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:09.005 region:rollup2
THE ACT COLLEGE THIS ONLINE

01:05:06.369 --> 01:05:12.742 region:rollup2
COLLEGE WOULD ACTUALLY BE. OF

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:14.110 region:rollup2
FACULTY OF A DIFFERENT COLLEGE.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:16.312 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WOULD BE DETERMINED

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:17.380 region:rollup2
THAT'S PART OF THE AGREEMENT

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:18.648 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.783 region:rollup2
BARGAIN WITH WITH WITH WITH

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:21.418 region:rollup2
THEIR NOT INVITING WITH THE

01:05:19.783 --> 01:05:21.851 region:rollup2
BOARD OF TRUSTEES ARE NOT GOING

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:22.685 region:rollup2
TO BARGAIN WITH THE.

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:24.220 region:rollup2
.

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:25.522 region:rollup2
RIGHT RIGHT FOR THE PURPOSES OF

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.823 region:rollup2
WHAT WE TRADITIONALLY THINK OF

01:05:25.522 --> 01:05:28.691 region:rollup2
AS KIND OF THE EMPLOYMENT

01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:30.326 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP OF WHO DIRECTS THE

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:31.294 region:rollup2
WORK WHO MANAGES THE EMPLOYEES

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:32.962 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD BE EMPLOYEES OF THE

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:34.631 region:rollup2
ONLINE COLLEGE. I THINK FOR

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:35.198 region:rollup2
PURPOSES OF COLLECTIVE

01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:37.567 region:rollup2
BARGAINING.

01:05:35.198 --> 01:05:37.867 region:rollup2
WE HEARD A LOT OF FEEDBACK THAT

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:39.436 region:rollup2
WE HAD BEEN.

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:40.870 region:rollup2
.

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:42.372 region:rollup2
THAT IT WAS UNCLEAR HOW

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:43.973 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WOULD WORK

01:05:42.372 --> 01:05:46.576 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IS THIS COLLEGES

01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:50.013 region:rollup2
SET UP AND SO WE THINK IT'S ARM

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:50.613 region:rollup2
A WORKABLE. STRUCTURE THAT MAKES

01:05:50.013 --> 01:05:53.249 region:rollup2
SENSE TO.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:54.751 region:rollup2
TO MAKE CLEAR THAT COLLECTIVE

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:55.919 region:rollup2
BARGAINING APPLIES IMMEDIATELY

01:05:54.751 --> 01:05:57.353 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS HOW WE WOULD MAKE IT

01:05:55.919 --> 01:05:58.755 region:rollup2
AFFECT HOW EFFECTUALLY BUT I

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:59.222 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT AT A

01:05:58.755 --> 01:06:00.957 region:rollup2
MINIMUM IT CERTAINLY.

01:05:59.222 --> 01:06:02.058 region:rollup2
CUMBERSOME.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.860 region:rollup2
THIS NEW.

01:06:02.058 --> 01:06:06.329 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.896 region:rollup2
AND WHO THE FACULTY REPORTS TO.

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:10.166 region:rollup2
AND.

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:11.534 region:rollup2
WHO THEY BARGAIN WITH?

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:13.002 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD THE ONE PIECE THAT I

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:14.470 region:rollup2
WOULD ADD TO THAT IS THAT IT

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:15.839 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A SEPARATE BARGAINING

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:18.408 region:rollup2
UNIT AT THAT COLLEGE SO IT

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:19.809 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T BE WITHIN. THE EXISTING

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:23.880 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT OF THAT THE PARTNER

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:26.282 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.084 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:29.819 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SO MEMBER LIMON. THANK

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:31.554 region:rollup2
YOU. AT A THINK THAT THERE'S

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:33.389 region:rollup2
BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION AND

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:36.025 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR

01:06:33.389 --> 01:06:37.260 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL AND NOT JUST LIMITED TO

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:38.261 region:rollup2
THIS BUILDING.

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.963 region:rollup2
BUT REALLY I THINK AT THE

01:06:38.261 --> 01:06:42.332 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE LEVEL I KNOW THAT.

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:44.434 region:rollup2
I FOR ONE HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT.

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:46.769 region:rollup2
IN THE DISTRICT A WITH MULTIPLE

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:49.072 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I GO BACK

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:51.641 region:rollup2
TO SOME OF MY EARLIER REMARKS ON

01:06:49.072 --> 01:06:53.676 region:rollup2
IN THIS PARTICULAR AT COMMITTEE.

01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:55.612 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOME OF THE ELEMENTS THAT.

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:57.380 region:rollup2
.

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:59.349 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO BE.

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:01.384 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS OR.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:03.319 region:rollup2
OF INTEREST IN IN IN MOVING

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:04.721 region:rollup2
FORWARD ON I A THINK YOU'VE

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:06.623 region:rollup2
HEARD FROM MULTIPLE COLLEAGUES

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:07.757 region:rollup2
AT THE PIECE ABOUT LAYING AT IN

01:07:06.623 --> 01:07:09.292 region:rollup2
TERMS OF LANGUAGE AND CLARITY

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:11.461 region:rollup2
ABOUT. WHO THE FACULTY WERE

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:13.563 region:rollup2
GONNA BE ARE THEY GONNA HAVE?

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:15.198 region:rollup2
BARGAINING UNITS WHO WOULD BE

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:16.933 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATING I THINK IS IMPORTANT

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:19.068 region:rollup2
IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS.

01:07:16.933 --> 01:07:22.038 region:rollup2
IN INTEREST IN KNOWING WHAT

01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:23.072 region:rollup2
THAT IS. AND SECONDLY ARE YOU

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.773 region:rollup2
KNOW A COUPLE MONTHS AGO I

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:25.975 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:28.144 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION WHY NOT THIS BE A

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:31.147 region:rollup2
PILOT WHY NOT UNDERSTAND WHETHER

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:32.849 region:rollup2
OR NOT ON THIS IS GOING TO BE

01:07:31.147 --> 01:07:35.385 region:rollup2
GOOD FOR THE LONG TERM.

01:07:32.849 --> 01:07:37.587 region:rollup2
YEAH THIRDLY ON IF IT'S A IF

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:40.857 region:rollup2
IT'S CONSIDERED A PILOT PROGRAM.

01:07:37.587 --> 01:07:42.992 region:rollup2
ON THE IDEA OF CREATING.

01:07:40.857 --> 01:07:44.394 region:rollup2
BOARD OF TRUSTEES SEEMS A

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:45.962 region:rollup2
LITTLE PREMATURE.

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:47.297 region:rollup2
IN UNTIL WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

01:07:45.962 --> 01:07:49.232 region:rollup2
ROLE IS AND.

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:50.867 region:rollup2
FOURTH AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:51.467 region:rollup2
OF CONVERSATION ABOUT REALLY

01:07:50.867 --> 01:07:53.002 region:rollup2
LIMITING THE COURSES TEND NOT

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:54.938 region:rollup2
TO.

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:56.339 region:rollup2
BEING THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY

01:07:54.938 --> 01:07:58.107 region:rollup2
OFFERED BY EXISTING COMMUNITY

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:59.809 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AND SO I WANTED TO

01:07:58.107 --> 01:08:01.077 region:rollup2
SHARE SOME OF THOSE PIECES JUST

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:01.844 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THOSE ARE

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:04.480 region:rollup2
PIECES.

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:06.416 region:rollup2
THAT ARE STILL OUT THERE.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:08.451 region:rollup2
EIGHT SEEMS AT THE REPEATEDLY

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:10.353 region:rollup2
GET BROUGHT OUT BUT I ALSO THINK

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:11.821 region:rollup2
THAT IN SOME WAYS AND

01:08:10.353 --> 01:08:15.625 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION OF SOME OF THESE

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:18.061 region:rollup2
PIECES WOULD ALLOW FOR. PERHAPS.

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:19.228 region:rollup2
EXIT YOU KNOW AT A TIPPING TAD

01:08:18.061 --> 01:08:20.730 region:rollup2
BIT MORE COMFORT AND

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:22.632 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THIS COULD

01:08:20.730 --> 01:08:24.233 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE BOTH IN THE SHORT TERM

01:08:22.632 --> 01:08:25.868 region:rollup2
AND THE LONG TERM. I'M SO I

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:27.337 region:rollup2
WANTED TO SHARE THAT AND KNOW

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:30.807 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS.

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:32.175 region:rollup2
PART OF IT. HAS IT IN REACHED UP

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:35.044 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT.

01:08:32.175 --> 01:08:37.513 region:rollup2
WHAT WE THINK OF ONLINE ON IT

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:38.681 region:rollup2
LEARNING I'M ALTOGETHER AYE AND

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:39.482 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:42.018 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO HAVE THIS

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:44.120 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION BUT I DO HOPE THAT?

01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:45.855 region:rollup2
IN EFFORT TO.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.523 region:rollup2
BUT TO BRING MORE STAKEHOLDERS

IMPORTANT I'M A ISSUE THAT

01:14:16.652 --> 01:14:18.854 region:rollup2
WASN'T THERE IN JANUARY THAT WE

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:21.257 region:rollup2
THINK HELPS ENSURE THAT THERE'S

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:23.125 region:rollup2
MORE. INCENTIVE FOR COLLEGES TO

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:24.627 region:rollup2
REALLY FOCUS ON IMPROVING OTHER

THAT WE THINK THE UP ABOUT A

01:14:30.533 --> 01:14:33.669 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THAT IN JANUARY WE DID

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:35.004 region:rollup2
HAD RECOMMENDED ADOPTING I THINK

01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:37.573 region:rollup2
WE RECOGNIZE THOUGH THAT. THE

01:14:35.004 --> 01:14:38.407 region:rollup2
LAB WE VERY FAST AND AND ARE YOU

REALLY BUT THOROUGHLY BACK AND

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:42.845 region:rollup2
REVIEW BALANCE OF OF THE

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:44.914 region:rollup2
PROPOSED ON THIS IS A MORE

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:46.382 region:rollup2
COMPLEX PROPOSAL THEM. BENT DOWN

01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:48.217 region:rollup2
WE HAD IN JANUARY THERE THERE

01:14:46.382 --> 01:14:49.352 region:rollup2
ARE A LOT THE OUTCOMES BASED

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:51.487 region:rollup2
PORTION IN PARTICULAR IS THAT IT

01:14:49.352 --> 01:14:53.189 region:rollup2
IS MUCH MORE COMPLEX SO WE'RE

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:54.857 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDING THAT YOU ADOPT THE

01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:56.792 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROPOSAL.

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:57.560 region:rollup2
BUT NOT AND NOT TO BE

01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:59.462 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED UNTIL NINETEEN

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:01.063 region:rollup2
TWENTY I'M AND THEN THERE IN THE

01:14:59.462 --> 01:15:02.498 region:rollup2
SUMMER THROUGH LEGISLATION I'M

YOU CAN BET THE SPECIFIC

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:05.868 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS OF THAT OF THE

PERFORMANCE BASED.

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:08.170 region:rollup2
AND THE FUNDAMENTAL GRANT

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.804 region:rollup2

I'M IF YOU DID DO THAT THEN.

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:25.354 region:rollup2
THERE IS ABOUT BY TWO HUNDRED

WITH SORT OF HOLDING.

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:36.565 region:rollup2
IT'S HARMLESS FOR THE TRANSITION

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:38.834 region:rollup2
THAT FUNDING WOULD BE FREED UP

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:40.336 region:rollup2
FOR ONE TYPES.

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:41.170 region:rollup2

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:55.337 region:rollup2

THAT.

01:18:25.935 --> 01:18:31.440 region:rollup2
DEBIAN TO REFLECT THE A THE

FOCUS ON OUTCOMES THAT WE THINK

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.876 region:rollup2
ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT.

I I DON'T THINK THIS IS A BAD

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:42.117 region:rollup2
IDEA. AS FAR AS

01:18:40.983 --> 01:18:43.986 region:rollup2

COOKED READY TO GO AS THE LA

01:18:49.091 --> 01:18:51.260 region:rollup2
ALLUDED TO. AT LAST YEAR'S

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:52.695 region:rollup2
SUMMIT REALLY MONNING I

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:10.613 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE DAY AFTER A

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:11.480 region:rollup2
YEAR AND A HALF PROCESS

01:19:10.613 --> 01:19:13.782 region:rollup2
WE HAD CONSENSUS WITH.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:15.251 region:rollup2
.

01:19:13.782 --> 01:19:17.920 region:rollup2
THE AT THE END COALITION

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:19.421 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WITH THAT ACCESS AND

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.824 region:rollup2
SCHOOL BOARDS AND. TEACHERS

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:23.626 region:rollup2
UNIONS AND SO FORTH AND SO.

01:19:21.824 --> 01:19:24.927 region:rollup2
THAT IS IS VIC IS REALLY LACKING

01:19:23.626 --> 01:19:26.228 region:rollup2
HERE TODAY AND I THINK THAT

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:28.731 region:rollup2
MAKES I MEAN I THINK THE

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:31.066 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. UNEASY ABOUT DOING

01:19:28.731 --> 01:19:32.601 region:rollup2
SUCH A A MAJOR CHANGE WHEN THERE

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:34.803 region:rollup2
IS LOT OF CONSTERNATION AND

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:37.172 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY. AND PERCEIVE MAJOR

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:38.774 region:rollup2
WINNERS AND LOSERS AND WE HEARD

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:41.343 region:rollup2
LOUD AND CLEAR FROM SOME OF THE.

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:42.978 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:45.581 region:rollup2
EARLIER HEARING AND AND THE NEW.

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:47.016 region:rollup2
RUNS THAT YOU CREATE THAT

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:48.484 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK BRING A LITTLE

01:19:47.016 --> 01:19:50.252 region:rollup2
MORE CLARITY BUT THERE ARE STILL

01:19:48.484 --> 01:19:52.454 region:rollup2
SON. WHO HAD DIED A LOT OF

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:54.690 region:rollup2
CONCERNS AND THE HOLD HARMLESS

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:55.257 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS IT'S ANOTHER YEAR OF

01:19:54.690 --> 01:19:55.557 region:rollup2
HOLD HARMLESS BUT AFTER THE

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:57.326 region:rollup2
THIRD YEAR?

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:58.861 region:rollup2
IT'S KIND OF A CLIFF.

01:19:57.326 --> 01:20:00.596 region:rollup2
AND AND SOME OF THE DISTRICTS

01:19:58.861 --> 01:20:02.297 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD SENSI.

01:20:00.596 --> 01:20:04.300 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ALLOCATION WOULD BE

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:06.068 region:rollup2
LESS THAN THEY WOULD GET.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:08.437 region:rollup2
UNDER JUST A BASIC COLA SO.

01:20:06.068 --> 01:20:10.172 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:20:08.437 --> 01:20:12.274 region:rollup2
NOT CERTAIN IF FOR ALL THEIR

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:15.044 region:rollup2
GUIDES JUST YET DOWN PLUS THE.

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:15.544 region:rollup2
THAT THE METRICS THAT WOULD

01:20:15.044 --> 01:20:16.912 region:rollup2
THAT WE PUT IN HERE FOR.

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:19.281 region:rollup2
.

01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:21.383 region:rollup2
FLORA FOR SUCCESS I THINK THERE

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:22.885 region:rollup2
ARE SOME QUESTIONS TO HELP OUT

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:24.320 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD WORK IF THEY'RE FAIR

01:20:22.885 --> 01:20:26.288 region:rollup2
OR IF WE SHOULD JUST.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:28.057 region:rollup2
BASICALLY GO TO WHAT MARCH WHICH

01:20:26.288 --> 01:20:29.591 region:rollup2
WE DID WITH LCF ACTRESS

01:20:28.057 --> 01:20:31.060 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THE STUDENT POPULATION

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:33.862 region:rollup2
WHATEVER IT IS AND JUST FOCUS ON

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:34.897 region:rollup2
THAT AND I'M I'M PROBABLY MORE.

01:20:33.862 --> 01:20:37.399 region:rollup2
ON THE.

01:20:34.897 --> 01:20:38.934 region:rollup2
IT INCLINED THAT WAY SO I DON'T

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:40.402 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE'RE YOU WORK YOU

01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:42.071 region:rollup2
WORK WERE READY TO DO WHAT I'M

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:43.505 region:rollup2
DOING TODAY OBVIOUSLY BUT. AS

01:20:42.071 --> 01:20:44.840 region:rollup2
FAR AS RIGHT NOW ANTHONY REVISED

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:45.874 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO IT TO EMBRACE THIS

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:48.077 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:20:45.874 --> 01:20:49.745 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S LATER THIS SUMMER

01:20:48.077 --> 01:20:51.113 region:rollup2
OR EVEN BUT DOWN THE ROAD I

01:20:49.745 --> 01:20:52.815 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE.

01:20:51.113 --> 01:20:54.983 region:rollup2
A BROADER STAKEHOLDER PROCESS

01:20:52.815 --> 01:20:56.552 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WITH.

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:58.153 region:rollup2
FACULTY AND ACADEMIC SENATE

01:20:56.552 --> 01:20:59.788 region:rollup2
ENGAGED IN HELPING CRATER AND

01:20:58.153 --> 01:21:01.423 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT WE SAW WITH

01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:02.825 region:rollup2
LCF AT THE END OF THE DAY.

01:21:01.423 --> 01:21:05.661 region:rollup2
EVERYONE'S IN FRONT OF US AMBER

01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:06.295 region:rollup2
EMBRACING US SUCH A CONCEPT AT

01:21:05.661 --> 01:21:08.497 region:rollup2
AND ALSO KNOW THAT THE CURRENT.

01:21:06.295 --> 01:21:09.431 region:rollup2
.

01:21:08.497 --> 01:21:11.266 region:rollup2
CURRENT COMMITTEE BECAUSE

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:13.836 region:rollup2
APARTMENT FORMULA DOESN'T WORK

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:15.003 region:rollup2
FOR ANYBODY. SLOW DEATH.

01:21:13.836 --> 01:21:16.071 region:rollup2
SPIRAL FOR SOME COMMITTEE CALL

01:21:15.003 --> 01:21:17.406 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT WE NEEDED

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:19.241 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE AS WELL SO.

01:21:17.406 --> 01:21:19.742 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST SOME OVER ARCHING.

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:20.876 region:rollup2
COMMENTS.

01:21:19.742 --> 01:21:23.112 region:rollup2
.

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:24.680 region:rollup2
THE START THIS MORNING.

01:21:23.112 --> 01:21:25.948 region:rollup2
MISTER O'DONNELL BY THANK YOU

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:27.449 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR AND I AGREE WITH

01:21:25.948 --> 01:21:28.550 region:rollup2
YOUR COMMENTS THERE AGAIN I MY

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:30.152 region:rollup2
MY BIGGEST CONCERN HERE IS THE

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:32.387 region:rollup2
WINNERS AND LOSERS.

01:21:30.152 --> 01:21:33.622 region:rollup2
BUT MORE PARTLY Y. THEIR

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:35.324 region:rollup2
WINNERS AND LOSERS MAYBE YOU

01:21:33.622 --> 01:21:37.893 region:rollup2
COULD SPEAK TO THAT.

01:21:35.324 --> 01:21:39.995 region:rollup2
I'M. IT AND AND LOOK AT MY OWN

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:41.163 region:rollup2
LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE.

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:42.331 region:rollup2
I'M WILL THE LONGISH COLLEGE

01:21:41.163 --> 01:21:43.899 region:rollup2
PROMISES WHICH IS BEEN A

01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:45.067 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL PATH. TO YOUR KIDS

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:46.969 region:rollup2
OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL INTO

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:48.637 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND ON TO THE

01:21:46.969 --> 01:21:50.706 region:rollup2
FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY.

01:21:48.637 --> 01:21:51.974 region:rollup2
BUT WITHOUT IN A.

01:21:50.706 --> 01:21:54.109 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES THAT DOESN'T MEAN

01:21:51.974 --> 01:21:54.877 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL.

01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:56.612 region:rollup2
THEY BOUNCED INTO COMMUNITY

01:21:54.877 --> 01:21:58.313 region:rollup2
COLLEGE DID WHAT THEY NEEDED YOU

01:21:56.612 --> 01:21:59.248 region:rollup2
AND THEN BOUNCE OUR. IS MY

01:21:58.313 --> 01:22:01.150 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WOULD

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:01.784 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BE DOING BECAUSE IT OUR

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:03.786 region:rollup2
STUDENTS DIDN'T GET.

01:22:01.784 --> 01:22:05.621 region:rollup2
THE A.

01:22:03.786 --> 01:22:07.189 region:rollup2
SO YEAH MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO

01:22:05.621 --> 01:22:08.457 region:rollup2
THAT AND THEN WHAT IF I CHOSE TO

01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:10.592 region:rollup2
GO TO A COMMUNICABLE JIM TAKE UP

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:11.260 region:rollup2
PHOTOGRAPHY COURSE.

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.161 region:rollup2
FOR FOR PERSONAL ENRICHMENT BUT

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:14.062 region:rollup2
ALSO SOME SKILLS.

01:22:12.161 --> 01:22:15.264 region:rollup2
.

01:22:14.062 --> 01:22:16.598 region:rollup2
BUT THAT DIDN'T LEAD TO A DEGREE

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:19.168 region:rollup2
MAYBE I EVEN ALREADY HAVE A

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:19.735 region:rollup2
DEGREE WHERE WHERE DOES THAT.

01:22:19.168 --> 01:22:20.803 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THAT PLAY INTO THE

01:22:19.735 --> 01:22:22.371 region:rollup2
FORMULA CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH

01:22:20.803 --> 01:22:24.740 region:rollup2
THE?

01:22:22.371 --> 01:22:26.675 region:rollup2
SURE I AM SO WE DID RELEASE AND

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:28.377 region:rollup2
SOME RAT AS SOME FORMULA

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:29.545 region:rollup2
SIMULATIONS SWEET IT'S ABOUT

01:22:28.377 --> 01:22:31.947 region:rollup2
YOUR PROJECTIONS.

01:22:29.545 --> 01:22:33.515 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE VARIOUS AT FACTORS

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:35.484 region:rollup2
AND WHY SOME DISTRICTS ARE

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:38.120 region:rollup2
GROWING MORE THAN OTHERS.

01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:40.088 region:rollup2
IS A COMBINATION OF AREAS.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:42.157 region:rollup2
FACTORS TO SELL TYPICALLY

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:45.127 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT SERVE THAT OUR

01:22:42.157 --> 01:22:46.962 region:rollup2
HIGHEST AT A LOW INCOME STUDENTS

01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:49.331 region:rollup2
ADAM AND TO HAVE THAT.

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:54.503 region:rollup2
HIGHS OUTCOMES TYPICALLY SEE.

01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:55.604 region:rollup2
AB MORE GROWTH THAN THAT OTHER

01:22:54.503 --> 01:22:56.505 region:rollup2
AYE AYE DISTRICTS.

01:22:55.604 --> 01:22:57.739 region:rollup2
I OF COURSE THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:22:56.505 --> 01:22:59.708 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT WE TRY TO

01:22:57.739 --> 01:23:03.145 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT THE AA ISN'T THE

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:05.147 region:rollup2
ONLY ADDS SUCCESS AT METRIC AND

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:07.082 region:rollup2
THE MAY REVISION. PROPOSES AYE

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:08.784 region:rollup2
REVISIONS TO THOSE METRICS TO

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:10.419 region:rollup2
INCLUDE OTHER THINGS LIKE AB

01:23:08.784 --> 01:23:12.855 region:rollup2
COMPLETION A TRANSFER LEVEL AT

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:15.257 region:rollup2
MATH AND ENGLISH COMPLETION OF A

01:23:12.855 --> 01:23:16.592 region:rollup2
NINE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION.

01:23:15.257 --> 01:23:18.393 region:rollup2
AYE UNITS WHO ARE TRYING TO

01:23:16.592 --> 01:23:18.827 region:rollup2
BALANCE AB BASED ON THE

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:20.162 region:rollup2
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:22.965 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS AYE THOSE

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:24.933 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PROGRESS AND AYE. AYES

01:23:22.965 --> 01:23:26.702 region:rollup2
SUCCESS AT METRICS AS PART OF

01:23:24.933 --> 01:23:28.604 region:rollup2
THAT ANY OTHER COMPONENT TO IT

01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:29.538 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT

01:23:28.604 --> 01:23:32.074 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF ANSWERING

01:23:29.538 --> 01:23:33.542 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY OVER THE TRANSITION.

01:23:32.074 --> 01:23:34.676 region:rollup2
ONTO THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA.

01:23:33.542 --> 01:23:36.578 region:rollup2
SO.

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:38.113 region:rollup2
WE EXTEND THAT THE HOLD

01:23:36.578 --> 01:23:39.748 region:rollup2
HARMLESS AN ABSOLUTE HOLD

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:42.217 region:rollup2
HARMLESS FOR TWO YEARS.

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:44.686 region:rollup2
AT WHEN WE DID OUR PROJECTIONS.

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:46.288 region:rollup2
UP THAT WE RELEASED I WOULD

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:47.723 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT THESE ARE BASED ON

01:23:46.288 --> 01:23:49.324 region:rollup2
JUST FIVE YEAR OUT PACK PRIOR

01:23:47.723 --> 01:23:49.825 region:rollup2
YEAR FIVE YEAR AVERAGES OF THE

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:52.060 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT METRICS SO AS

01:23:49.825 --> 01:23:54.663 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:56.365 region:rollup2
I BEGIN TO AS THE MORE SUCCESS

01:23:54.663 --> 01:23:59.434 region:rollup2
IN FRANCE AND IMPLEMENTING SEVEN

01:23:56.365 --> 01:24:00.769 region:rollup2
A FIVE AND A STUDENTS OUT. OF A

01:23:59.434 --> 01:24:02.137 region:rollup2
BAD COMPLETING TRANSFER LEVEL

01:24:00.769 --> 01:24:04.273 region:rollup2
MATH AND ENGLISH WE SHOULD SEE

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:05.707 region:rollup2
THOSE SUCCESS METRICS INCREASED

01:24:04.273 --> 01:24:06.842 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN THESE ARE PROJECTIONS

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:09.578 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S HERE THERE'S AN

01:24:06.842 --> 01:24:11.213 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLEGES AT TO

01:24:09.578 --> 01:24:13.048 region:rollup2
GROW FISCALLY BY NOT JUST ARE

01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:16.318 region:rollup2
ONLY MORE STUDENTS BUT BY. AYE

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:16.585 region:rollup2
MAKING PROGRESS ON THOSE VARIOUS

01:24:16.318 --> 01:24:17.552 region:rollup2
METRICS.

01:24:16.585 --> 01:24:18.687 region:rollup2
SO I AM.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:20.656 region:rollup2
THAT'S CRAZY PUSHED OUT THE HOLD

01:24:18.687 --> 01:24:22.024 region:rollup2
HARMLESS PROVISIONS BUT.

01:24:20.656 --> 01:24:23.425 region:rollup2
SO YOU WAIT THREE YEARS AND YOU

01:24:22.024 --> 01:24:24.660 region:rollup2
OFF A CLIFF ALSO DOING IS

01:24:23.425 --> 01:24:24.993 region:rollup2
DELAYING THE INEVITABLE FOR SOME

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:26.862 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY.

01:24:24.993 --> 01:24:28.130 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:24:26.862 --> 01:24:29.131 region:rollup2
MY ONE OF MY MAIN CONCERNS HERE

01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:30.732 region:rollup2
IS VELOCITY.

01:24:29.131 --> 01:24:31.566 region:rollup2
I I DON'T KNOW THAT EVERY THIS

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:33.168 region:rollup2
BUILDING HAS THE WORLD

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:35.237 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE THAT OTHERS HAVE.

01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:36.705 region:rollup2
I'VE MYSELF WAS A P. COLLEGE

01:24:35.237 --> 01:24:38.574 region:rollup2
WHAT FOR FIVE YEARS I WORKED.

01:24:36.705 --> 01:24:40.776 region:rollup2
IN A FULL TIME PART TIME.

01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:41.577 region:rollup2
SO I AM MY TIMELINE TO GET OUT

01:24:40.776 --> 01:24:42.344 region:rollup2
OF COMMUNICABLE IT'S WAS

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:43.812 region:rollup2
EXTENDED DUE TO PERSONAL

01:24:42.344 --> 01:24:45.280 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:46.315 region:rollup2
DOES THE FORMULA CONTEMPLATE

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.950 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE WE MIGHT HAVE

01:24:46.315 --> 01:24:50.786 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT ARE ONLY.

01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:52.087 region:rollup2
ABLE TO TAKE A CLASS IN YOUR

01:24:50.786 --> 01:24:52.788 region:rollup2
THIS THE COLLEGE SHOULDN'T GET

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:56.291 region:rollup2
QUOTE UNQUOTE PUNISHED.

01:24:52.788 --> 01:24:56.491 region:rollup2
FOR THAT.

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:58.593 region:rollup2
SURE.

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:59.995 region:rollup2
.

01:24:58.593 --> 01:25:00.996 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE TO MAKE A FEW BROADER

01:24:59.995 --> 01:25:03.131 region:rollup2
POINTS THAT I YOU KNOW I JUST

01:25:00.996 --> 01:25:05.834 region:rollup2
WANT TO REITERATE FINANCES POINT

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:08.003 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW THE.

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:09.237 region:rollup2
BUT THE PROPOSAL EXTENDS A HOLD

01:25:08.003 --> 01:25:10.839 region:rollup2
HARMLESS FOR SECOND YEAR WE

01:25:09.237 --> 01:25:12.407 region:rollup2
IMAGINE OVER THOSE TWO YEARS

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:13.475 region:rollup2
COLLEGES ARE CHANGING BEHAVIOR

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:15.711 region:rollup2
IN SUCH A WAY THAT.

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:17.679 region:rollup2
THE DATE ON THAT PIECE OF PAPER.

01:25:15.711 --> 01:25:19.214 region:rollup2
ISN'T WOULDN'T BE NECESSARILY

01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:20.415 region:rollup2
BE REFLECTIVE OF THE DATA USED

01:25:19.214 --> 01:25:22.117 region:rollup2
TO CALCULATE FUNDING IN YOUR

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:23.552 region:rollup2
THREE WE THINK THAT. YOU KNOW

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:25.253 region:rollup2
THEY COR PROMISE OF THIS

01:25:23.552 --> 01:25:26.922 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS THAT OUGHT BY

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:28.023 region:rollup2
IDENTICALLY REALLY IDENTIFYING

01:25:26.922 --> 01:25:29.358 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOMES WE CARE ABOUT CLEAR

01:25:28.023 --> 01:25:30.859 region:rollup2
IT PHILLY IDENTIFYING THE TYPES

01:25:29.358 --> 01:25:31.727 region:rollup2
OF STUDENTS WE THINK FACE

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:33.295 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY HIGH BARRIERS TO

01:25:31.727 --> 01:25:34.563 region:rollup2
SUCCESS. THAT OVER THE NEXT TWO

01:25:33.295 --> 01:25:36.298 region:rollup2
YEARS COLLEGES ARE CHANGING

01:25:34.563 --> 01:25:38.166 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:40.068 region:rollup2
DATA THERE ISN'T REFLECTIVE SO I

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:41.236 region:rollup2
THINK FOR. DISTRICTS THAT IN

01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:43.171 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IN NINETEEN

01:25:41.236 --> 01:25:44.039 region:rollup2
TWENTY WOULD BE GUARANTEED AS

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:45.707 region:rollup2
MUCH AS THEY RECEIVED IN

01:25:44.039 --> 01:25:47.609 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FOR THOSE FOR

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:49.311 region:rollup2
WHOM THAT THE FORMULA. DOESN'T

01:25:47.609 --> 01:25:50.812 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY ARE PROJECTED GROWTH

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:51.780 region:rollup2
WE WE WOULD EXPECT AND WE WOULD

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:53.515 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT.

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:55.417 region:rollup2
THERE ARE.

01:25:53.515 --> 01:25:56.885 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES THAT. YOU KNOW THAT

01:25:55.417 --> 01:25:58.787 region:rollup2
THEIR OPTIMISM FOR IF I THINK

01:25:56.885 --> 01:26:00.689 region:rollup2
THE SECOND POINT AROUND UMMC A

01:25:58.787 --> 01:26:01.490 region:rollup2
CAN OF STUDENTS WHO TRANSFER

01:26:00.689 --> 01:26:04.459 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ASSERTIVE ARE WITHOUT A

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:04.960 region:rollup2
DEGREE. OF THESE POPULATIONS OF

01:26:04.459 --> 01:26:06.762 region:rollup2
STUDENTS I THINK WHAT.

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.796 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:26:06.762 --> 01:26:09.731 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE

01:26:07.796 --> 01:26:11.800 region:rollup2
MADE UP BEGIN TO ALLIED WHAT'S

01:26:09.731 --> 01:26:12.901 region:rollup2
USED IN FUNDING FOR THE VALUES

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.802 region:rollup2
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE

01:26:12.901 --> 01:26:15.971 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR HAVE ALREADY.

01:26:13.802 --> 01:26:17.539 region:rollup2
HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT

01:26:15.971 --> 01:26:19.441 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:21.476 region:rollup2
HAVE MADE AYE ASSOCIATE DEGREES

01:26:19.441 --> 01:26:22.944 region:rollup2
FOR TRANSFER A PRIORITY THAT WE

01:26:21.476 --> 01:26:24.312 region:rollup2
THINK THERE ARE CLEAR BENEFITS

01:26:22.944 --> 01:26:26.181 region:rollup2
TO A STUDENT WHO TRANCERS WITH

01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:27.482 region:rollup2
AN ADT. VERSUS STUDENTS WHO

01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:29.851 region:rollup2
TRANSFER OUT WITHOUT WHAT THE

01:26:27.482 --> 01:26:31.420 region:rollup2
PAY GET BENEFITS AT AT THE CSU

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:33.288 region:rollup2
THAT NOW GET BENEFITS OF THE UC

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:34.856 region:rollup2
BENEFIT WITH THEY GET THERE'S NO

01:26:33.288 --> 01:26:36.091 region:rollup2
REASON TO GET IN A FEW GO.

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:36.925 region:rollup2
GONNA BE A WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY

01:26:36.091 --> 01:26:38.393 region:rollup2
HAVE PAID IT BUT I'M NOT GONNA

01:26:36.925 --> 01:26:40.695 region:rollup2
ARGUE OVER THAT THERE IS NO READ

01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:43.098 region:rollup2
TO SPEND MORE TIME GETTING A.

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:44.733 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DEFEATS YOUR GOAL WHICH

01:26:43.098 --> 01:26:45.634 region:rollup2
IS REALLY VELOCITY I THINK.

01:26:44.733 --> 01:26:47.202 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT SOME WHERE

01:26:45.634 --> 01:26:48.403 region:rollup2
WE GOT VOLUME RIGHT AND THE GUYS

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:50.272 region:rollup2
ARE INTERESTED VELOCITY BUT

01:26:48.403 --> 01:26:52.474 region:rollup2
AGAIN I'M STILL STUCK ON. PEOPLE

01:26:50.272 --> 01:26:54.609 region:rollup2
HAVE PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

01:26:52.474 --> 01:26:56.912 region:rollup2
DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO GET THROUGH

01:26:54.609 --> 01:26:57.879 region:rollup2
A DEGREE IN FOUR YEARS I THINK

01:26:56.912 --> 01:26:59.114 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING ARE

01:26:57.879 --> 01:27:00.449 region:rollup2
LIVING IN A DIFFERENT WORLD LOT

01:26:59.114 --> 01:27:02.484 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WORK HERE RIGHT FRANKLIN.

01:27:00.449 --> 01:27:04.352 region:rollup2
DID THAT THEY HAVE THE FINANCIAL

01:27:02.484 --> 01:27:05.954 region:rollup2
WHEREWITHAL. THEY IS THE MEANS

01:27:04.352 --> 01:27:08.223 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT BUT NOT EVERYBODY IN

01:27:05.954 --> 01:27:09.891 region:rollup2
THE WORLD HAS THAT SITUATION SO

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:11.893 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT ANYTIME MUCH CHANGING

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:13.361 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR WHAT BEHAVIOR ARE YOU

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:14.629 region:rollup2
TRYING TO CHANGE. THE U. TRYING

01:27:13.361 --> 01:27:16.631 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:17.599 region:rollup2
COLLEGE OR THE STUDENT I DON'T

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:18.233 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT.

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:19.868 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GONNA

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:20.869 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE A STUDENT TO GET

01:27:19.868 --> 01:27:22.304 region:rollup2
THROUGH IT FOR YEARS WHEN

01:27:20.869 --> 01:27:24.039 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT YOU HAVE CHILDREN AT

01:27:22.304 --> 01:27:25.674 region:rollup2
HOME A JOB THEY'VE GOT TO PAY

01:27:24.039 --> 01:27:28.176 region:rollup2
RENT. HE GOT A PAPER FOOD I

01:27:25.674 --> 01:27:28.977 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW HOW THIS FORMULA IS

01:27:28.176 --> 01:27:30.078 region:rollup2
GOING TO ADDRESS THAT AND I

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:32.080 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY BUT CLEARLY THE

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:33.315 region:rollup2
COLLEGE I THINK THE HEAT CONTENT

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.850 region:rollup2
OF THE BEHAVIOR CHANGES AT THE

01:27:33.315 --> 01:27:35.817 region:rollup2
COLLEGE LEVEL AROUND.

01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:37.919 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION AROUND

01:27:35.817 --> 01:27:38.920 region:rollup2
HOW STUDENTS ARE PLACED INTO

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:40.388 region:rollup2
GUIDED PATHWAYS AROUND HOW

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.923 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE ADVISED TO DEGREES

01:27:40.388 --> 01:27:43.825 region:rollup2
SO I THINK. FOCUSING ON.

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:46.027 region:rollup2
A CREATING INCENTIVES FOR

01:27:43.825 --> 01:27:48.263 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS TO CLEARLY FOCUS ON

01:27:46.027 --> 01:27:49.731 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL GOALS INSTANCES I

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:52.234 region:rollup2
THINK THE INTENT OF AFFIRMATIVE.

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:53.335 region:rollup2
WHAT ABOUT VELOCITY ABOUT?

01:27:52.234 --> 01:27:54.436 region:rollup2
CAN I BE SPENT EARNING USE THAT

01:27:53.335 --> 01:27:55.937 region:rollup2
AS THAT CONTEMPLATED IN THE

01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:57.239 region:rollup2
FORMULA IT IS A CLEAR PART OF

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:58.406 region:rollup2
OUR VISION FOR SUCCESS OUR

01:27:57.239 --> 01:27:59.808 region:rollup2
VISION FOR SUCCESS SINCE TOO

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:01.510 region:rollup2
MANY STUDENTS TAKE MORE UNITS

01:27:59.808 --> 01:28:02.477 region:rollup2
THAN THEY NEED TO. SO YES I

01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:03.612 region:rollup2
THINK VELOCITY.

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:05.514 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE DON'T.

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:07.716 region:rollup2
SPECIFY A TIME PERIOD BUT I

01:28:05.514 --> 01:28:09.050 region:rollup2
THINK A V. FORMULA CREATES A

01:28:07.716 --> 01:28:10.485 region:rollup2
CLEAR INCENTIVE TO FIGURE OUT

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:11.686 region:rollup2
HOW TO GET STUDENTS OUT.

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:14.289 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY IN ED.

01:28:11.686 --> 01:28:15.190 region:rollup2
AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND AND I I

01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:16.458 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH THAT.

01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:18.827 region:rollup2
BUT I AGAIN AND I'M STILL

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:19.427 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THERE'S.

01:28:18.827 --> 01:28:22.697 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF.

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:24.166 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:25.801 region:rollup2
DISINCENTIVE EVEN TAKE ON THE

01:28:24.166 --> 01:28:27.469 region:rollup2
STUDENT IS GOING TO TAKE A.

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:27.969 region:rollup2
A PROJECTED PATH TO A DEGREE

01:28:27.469 --> 01:28:30.639 region:rollup2
WITH WITH THESE TYPES OF

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:32.274 region:rollup2
FORMULAS.

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:33.642 region:rollup2
AND TO HELP THEM TOWARD SUCCESS

01:28:32.274 --> 01:28:34.209 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ALL WE WE JUST ONE

01:28:33.642 --> 01:28:36.611 region:rollup2
PHILOSOPHY WHICH IS WHAT THE

01:28:34.209 --> 01:28:37.546 region:rollup2
LOS.

01:28:36.611 --> 01:28:39.247 region:rollup2
I WOULD ARE RIGHT I THINK

01:28:37.546 --> 01:28:41.082 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SEXY LEFT OF THAT.

01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:42.851 region:rollup2
THAT ASPECT IN THIS IT WITH ME

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:45.020 region:rollup2
RIVETED IN PART BECAUSE. IN THE

01:28:42.851 --> 01:28:46.354 region:rollup2
JANUARY PROPOSAL HAD SOME AWARD

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:48.056 region:rollup2
AMOUNT JUST SORT HOW MANY AWARDS

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:49.925 region:rollup2
DO YOU ISSUE IF YOU'RE. THE

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:51.960 region:rollup2
SECOND PIECE WAS A AWARD WITHIN

01:28:49.925 --> 01:28:53.128 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS SO THAT WAS A LOT

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.196 region:rollup2
MORE PRIOR TO THIS IN GETTING

01:28:53.128 --> 01:28:55.797 region:rollup2
FOLKS OUT IN THREE YEARS.

01:28:54.196 --> 01:28:57.365 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL DOESN'T HAVE THAT

01:28:55.797 --> 01:28:59.034 region:rollup2
COMPONENT WERE TIGHTENING IT BE

01:28:57.365 --> 01:29:01.002 region:rollup2
FUN. AT A THREE YEAR MARK THAT

01:28:59.034 --> 01:29:02.070 region:rollup2
DOES SORT OF IF YOU'RE CONCERNED

01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:03.738 region:rollup2
ABOUT THERE BEING THE TH.

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:04.940 region:rollup2
THAT BUT YOUR YOUR AWARDS ARE

01:29:03.738 --> 01:29:06.441 region:rollup2
GOING TO DISINFECT BY THE

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:07.209 region:rollup2
COLLEGE FROM REALLY PROVIDING

01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:08.510 region:rollup2
GOOD SERVICE TO SOMEBODY'S

01:29:07.209 --> 01:29:09.711 region:rollup2
APARTMENT DOMESTIC THERE'S A

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:11.746 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT LEFT IN THIS PROPOSAL

01:29:09.711 --> 01:29:12.414 region:rollup2
BUT I DO THINK THAT.

01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:14.149 region:rollup2
IF YOU GET YOUR GENERAL COMMENTS

01:29:12.414 --> 01:29:15.217 region:rollup2
THE GUARD PART OF WHY I THINK WE

01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:17.018 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GET THE PERHAPS THINKING

01:29:15.217 --> 01:29:17.786 region:rollup2
A LOT MORE TIME TO REVIEW THAT

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:20.789 region:rollup2
THAT THE DATA BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:29:17.786 --> 01:29:21.590 region:rollup2
SOME. IMPLICIT SORT OF A THING

01:29:20.789 --> 01:29:23.191 region:rollup2
THAT WE GET WILL TRY TO

01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:25.160 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE THROUGH THIS FOR THE

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:26.962 region:rollup2
RIGHT ONE OF THE FACTORS IS THAT

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.762 region:rollup2
THE THE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOW

01:29:26.962 --> 01:29:28.930 region:rollup2
MUCH.

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:30.198 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING A

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:31.333 region:rollup2
COLLEGE WOULD GET THEY GET MORE

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:32.667 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE

01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:33.902 region:rollup2
FOR TRANSFER.

01:29:32.667 --> 01:29:35.570 region:rollup2
ARE A LITTLE BIT LESS FOR AN

01:29:33.902 --> 01:29:36.872 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATE DEGREE AND THEN LEFT

01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:38.907 region:rollup2
THE MAP FOR A TRIP FOR A

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:40.542 region:rollup2
TRANSFER WITH NO DEGREE. I THINK

01:29:38.907 --> 01:29:41.810 region:rollup2
THAT THE REASON THAT THERE ARE

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:42.844 region:rollup2
SOME REASONS YOU WHAT MIGHT WANT

01:29:41.810 --> 01:29:44.145 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO.

01:29:42.844 --> 01:29:46.214 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE IN A THIRTY DEGREE FOR

01:29:44.145 --> 01:29:47.849 region:rollup2
TRANSFER BECAUSE THAT MIGHT HELP

THE ADMINISTRATION THOUGH RATHER

01:40:33.427 --> 01:40:36.130 region:rollup2
THAN JUST THINKING OF A

01:40:34.495 --> 01:40:37.465 region:rollup2
REDUCTION INTO A GENERAL FUND TO

01:40:36.130 --> 01:40:39.467 region:rollup2
THE ASSOCIATED CAL GRANT NO

01:40:37.465 --> 01:40:41.068 region:rollup2
CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. A INCREASES

01:40:39.467 --> 01:40:42.470 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMEND YOU CONSIDER DOING

01:40:41.068 --> 01:40:44.038 region:rollup2
A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR FOR ADOPTION

01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:45.940 region:rollup2
SO THE INC DISSOCIATED INCREASE

01:40:44.038 --> 01:40:47.575 region:rollup2
IN TUITION REVENUE YOU REDUCE

01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:48.175 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL FUND BY THAT AMOUNT.

01:40:47.575 --> 01:40:49.710 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD PROVIDE A STRONGER

01:40:48.175 --> 01:40:51.045 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE AND ALSO ENSURE THAT

01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:52.613 region:rollup2
ANY JEWISH INCREASES UNCOVERING

01:40:51.045 --> 01:40:54.448 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER COSTS THAT YOU HADN'T

01:40:52.613 --> 01:40:56.317 region:rollup2
HAD A. PRIORITIZE FOR THE

01:40:54.448 --> 01:40:57.485 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY IN THAT YEAR.

01:40:56.317 --> 01:40:58.786 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW THAT TO THE EXTENT

01:40:57.485 --> 01:40:59.921 region:rollup2
THAT TUITION IS OFF THE TABLE

01:40:58.786 --> 01:41:01.155 region:rollup2
FOR YOU THIS YEAR ANY OTHER

01:40:59.921 --> 01:41:01.956 region:rollup2
INCREASE WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:41:01.155 --> 01:41:03.190 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S

01:41:01.956 --> 01:41:05.793 region:rollup2
BUDGET WHICH WOULD HAVE TO COME

01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:07.395 region:rollup2
FROM THE GENERAL FUND.

01:41:05.793 --> 01:41:08.863 region:rollup2
THE SECOND ISSUE OUR WE WANT TO

01:41:07.395 --> 01:41:10.164 region:rollup2
WALK YOU THROUGH AS TO ITS KIND

01:41:08.863 --> 01:41:11.532 region:rollup2
OF FIVE DOWN ON THAT TABLE THERE

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:13.301 region:rollup2
TO PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY

01:41:11.532 --> 01:41:14.602 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ISSUE. WE THINK THIS

01:41:13.301 --> 01:41:16.637 region:rollup2
ISSUE RAISES A LOT OF QUESTIONS

01:41:14.602 --> 01:41:18.105 region:rollup2
FOR THE LEGISLATURE. ALL THE

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:19.941 region:rollup2
FIRST IS WHETHER OR NOT.

01:41:18.105 --> 01:41:21.943 region:rollup2
SAIKIA SITE YET A PSYCHIATRIC

01:41:19.941 --> 01:41:22.877 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE THE HIGHEST

01:41:21.943 --> 01:41:24.645 region:rollup2
PRIORITY FOR YOU THIS YEAR.

01:41:22.877 --> 01:41:25.646 region:rollup2
OTHER CONCERNS THAT OF FROM MANY

01:41:24.645 --> 01:41:26.814 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPECIALTY

01:41:25.646 --> 01:41:28.382 region:rollup2
AREAS OF THEIR SHORTAGES BOTH

01:41:26.814 --> 01:41:30.484 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE IN REGIONALLY YOU FOR

01:41:28.382 --> 01:41:31.185 region:rollup2
THE PAST HEARD CONCERNS ABOUT

01:41:30.484 --> 01:41:32.587 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS FOR

01:41:31.185 --> 01:41:33.521 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE. SO THIS IS A QUESTION

01:41:32.587 --> 01:41:34.622 region:rollup2
FOR YOU WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:41:33.521 --> 01:41:35.990 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY AREA IS YOUR HIGHEST

01:41:34.622 --> 01:41:36.757 region:rollup2
PRIORITY.

01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:38.392 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT IT IS A THEN

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:39.493 region:rollup2
RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE

01:41:38.392 --> 01:41:41.028 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING AYE IF YOU HEAR IS

01:41:39.493 --> 01:41:42.396 region:rollup2
WHAT MIGHT WE SEE THE SHORTAGES

01:41:41.028 --> 01:41:44.332 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:41:42.396 --> 01:41:45.933 region:rollup2
ARGUING TO INCREASE OF MORE

01:41:44.332 --> 01:41:47.034 region:rollup2
SLOTS FOR RESIDENCY PROGRAMS.

01:41:45.933 --> 01:41:48.302 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE STATE IN THE PAST THE

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:49.637 region:rollup2
STATUS TRIED OTHER AMOUNT

01:41:48.302 --> 01:41:51.472 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS TO SUCH AS LOAN

01:41:49.637 --> 01:41:53.274 region:rollup2
FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS RECRUITMENT

01:41:51.472 --> 01:41:54.241 region:rollup2
AND RETENTION PROGRAMS.

01:41:53.274 --> 01:41:55.076 region:rollup2
ALMOND SO THEY RAISE THE

01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:56.577 region:rollup2
QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS

01:41:55.076 --> 01:41:58.879 region:rollup2
REALLY SORT OF THE BEST POLICY

01:41:56.577 --> 01:42:00.181 region:rollup2
LEVER THAT YOU HAVE IN PLACE.

01:41:58.879 --> 01:42:00.815 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE IS

01:42:00.181 --> 01:42:02.416 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT.

01:42:00.815 --> 01:42:04.085 region:rollup2
THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:04.719 region:rollup2
A PIPELINE ISSUE IN THAT THEY'RE

01:42:04.085 --> 01:42:05.519 region:rollup2
MORE SPOTS THAT ARE NEEDED BY

01:42:04.719 --> 01:42:06.654 region:rollup2
THEIR NOT. A ONE TIME

01:42:05.519 --> 01:42:08.856 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATION IS REALLY THE BEST

01:42:06.654 --> 01:42:10.358 region:rollup2
SOLUTION HERE OR SOMETHING

01:42:08.856 --> 01:42:11.759 region:rollup2
ONGOING IS MORE WARRANTED.

01:42:10.358 --> 01:42:12.994 region:rollup2
NOT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS

01:42:11.759 --> 01:42:14.495 region:rollup2
IS A PRIORITY FOR YOU THIS YEAR

01:42:12.994 --> 01:42:15.630 region:rollup2
INTO THE SEND THAT YOU FEEL LIKE

01:42:14.495 --> 01:42:17.064 region:rollup2
YOU'VE YOU CAN I GET A HANDLE ON

01:42:15.630 --> 01:42:18.466 region:rollup2
THIS BEFORE AND TIME FOR BUDGET

01:42:17.064 --> 01:42:20.401 region:rollup2
CLOSE OUT. WE DO SOME OTHER

01:42:18.466 --> 01:42:21.836 region:rollup2
SUGGESTIONS THAT THAT COULD

01:42:20.401 --> 01:42:23.804 region:rollup2
IMPROVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

01:42:21.836 --> 01:42:24.639 region:rollup2
ALL THE FIRST IS TO MAKE ALL THE

01:42:23.804 --> 01:42:26.540 region:rollup2
FUNDING COMPETITIVE CURRENTLY

01:42:24.639 --> 01:42:27.708 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSING

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:29.577 region:rollup2
TO GIVE FORTY TWO YOU SEE AND

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:30.378 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN FOR GRANT PROGRAM. WE

01:42:29.577 --> 01:42:32.079 region:rollup2
THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO

01:42:30.378 --> 01:42:33.381 region:rollup2
MAKE THE WHOLE OUTFIT FIFTH OF

01:42:32.079 --> 01:42:34.749 region:rollup2
FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR

01:42:33.381 --> 01:42:36.083 region:rollup2
PROGRAM COMPETITIVE GRANTS SO

01:42:34.749 --> 01:42:37.018 region:rollup2
THAT IT REALLY TARGETED TOWARDS

01:42:36.083 --> 01:42:37.752 region:rollup2
THOSE.

01:42:37.018 --> 01:42:39.820 region:rollup2
A PROGRAMS THAT ARE ADDRESSING

01:42:37.752 --> 01:42:41.589 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST NEED.

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:42.990 region:rollup2
SECONDLY WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT

01:42:41.589 --> 01:42:44.258 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER A

01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:45.693 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATE ADMINISTERING THIS

01:42:44.258 --> 01:42:46.727 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT

01:42:45.693 --> 01:42:47.828 region:rollup2
BODY RATHER THAN YOU SEE TO

01:42:46.727 --> 01:42:49.697 region:rollup2
ENSURE NO PREFERENCES GIVEN TO

01:42:47.828 --> 01:42:51.632 region:rollup2
YOU SEE PROGRAMS.

01:42:49.697 --> 01:42:53.000 region:rollup2
AND YOU COULD USE AN EXISTING

01:42:51.632 --> 01:42:54.235 region:rollup2
BODY FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE OF

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.269 region:rollup2
THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH

01:42:54.235 --> 01:42:56.604 region:rollup2
PLANNING DEVELOPMENT.

01:42:55.269 --> 01:42:58.172 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERS A SUMMER PROGRAM FOR

01:42:56.604 --> 01:42:59.573 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE SO THAT'S ONE

01:42:58.172 --> 01:43:00.408 region:rollup2
PROGRAM YOU COULD CONSIDER.

01:42:59.573 --> 01:43:00.975 region:rollup2
WE ALSO RECOMMEND SOME

01:43:00.408 --> 01:43:02.743 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL REPORTING

01:43:00.975 --> 01:43:03.978 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AND THAT IT YOU

01:43:02.743 --> 01:43:05.379 region:rollup2
FURTHER CAPITA MINISTRY OF COST

01:43:03.978 --> 01:43:07.181 region:rollup2
WE THINK THE TEN PERCENT CAP IS

01:43:05.379 --> 01:43:07.681 region:rollup2
A BIT HIGH FIVE PERCENT OR SIX

01:43:07.181 --> 01:43:07.982 region:rollup2
PERCENT WOULD BE A MORE

01:43:07.681 --> 01:43:10.084 region:rollup2
REASONABLE.

01:43:07.982 --> 01:43:11.585 region:rollup2
AT PROGRAM.

01:43:10.084 --> 01:43:13.020 region:rollup2
THE FINAL THING I WOULD TOUCH ON

01:43:11.585 --> 01:43:14.188 region:rollup2
IN OUR CHART IS OF TOWARDS THE

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:16.023 region:rollup2
BOTTOM YOU'LL SEE SOMETHING FOR

01:43:14.188 --> 01:43:16.891 region:rollup2
YOU SEE PATH OPERATIONS AND THIS

01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:21.662 region:rollup2
IS AN ISSUE THAT THIS COMMITTEE

01:43:16.891 --> 01:43:22.363 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED UP IN A PRIOR HEARING

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:23.030 region:rollup2
AS YOU RECALL. A YOU SEE PATH IS

01:43:22.363 --> 01:43:23.597 region:rollup2
A PROJECT FROM THE UNIVERSITY TO

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:25.633 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE ALL OF ITS HUMAN

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:27.601 region:rollup2
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS INTO

01:43:25.633 --> 01:43:30.938 region:rollup2
ONE INTEGRATED SYSTEM.

01:43:27.601 --> 01:43:31.572 region:rollup2
AT A PRIOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OF

01:43:30.938 --> 01:43:32.907 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM IS FUNDED BY THE A

01:43:31.572 --> 01:43:34.308 region:rollup2
CHARGES ON THE CAMPUSES. IT

01:43:32.907 --> 01:43:35.709 region:rollup2
THOUGH PROGRAMS ROLLED INTO THE

01:43:34.308 --> 01:43:36.243 region:rollup2
USE YOUR P. LINE ITEM AND

01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:37.578 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BY THE

01:43:36.243 --> 01:43:38.279 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

01:43:37.578 --> 01:43:39.613 region:rollup2
I THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:43:38.279 --> 01:43:40.381 region:rollup2
PROPOSING TO BUDGET FOR THE

01:43:39.613 --> 01:43:42.516 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:43:40.381 --> 01:43:44.351 region:rollup2
IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

01:43:42.516 --> 01:43:45.986 region:rollup2
WE ARE BOTH BY A COMBINATION OF

01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:47.955 region:rollup2
A LINE ITEM AND CAMPUS CHARGES

01:43:45.986 --> 01:43:49.523 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT. A PROPOSALS OF

01:43:47.955 --> 01:43:50.691 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARILY COMPLEX

01:43:49.523 --> 01:43:51.592 region:rollup2
WE THINK A BETTER A MORE

01:43:50.691 --> 01:43:52.560 region:rollup2
RATIONAL APPROACH WOULD BE TO

01:43:51.592 --> 01:43:54.595 region:rollup2
JUST STICK WITH ONE EITHER A

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:56.163 region:rollup2
LINE ITEM OR CAMPUS CHARGES.

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:57.865 region:rollup2
AT THE MOMENT WE DO SEE SOME

01:43:56.163 --> 01:43:59.667 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGES TO IT GOING BACK TO A

01:43:57.865 --> 01:44:01.368 region:rollup2
USER FEE MODEL THE SYSTEM DOES

01:43:59.667 --> 01:44:02.937 region:rollup2
ON THE PROJECT SERVICE UPRIGHT

01:44:01.368 --> 01:44:03.938 region:rollup2
SERVICES TO CAMPUSES THE

01:44:02.937 --> 01:44:05.539 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES MIGHT BE. MORE

01:44:03.938 --> 01:44:07.208 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE TO INTERACT WITH

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:09.643 region:rollup2
THAT PROGRAM AND RETIRED CONTROL

01:44:07.208 --> 01:44:10.144 region:rollup2
COSTS IF THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:44:09.643 --> 01:44:11.445 region:rollup2
MANAGING THE COST OF THE

01:44:10.144 --> 01:44:12.613 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:44:11.445 --> 01:44:13.948 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER APPROACH

01:44:12.613 --> 01:44:15.749 region:rollup2
YOU TAKE WOULD YOU RECOMMEND A

01:44:13.948 --> 01:44:17.284 region:rollup2
RETHINKING THE STATE'S A SHARE

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:18.352 region:rollup2
OF THE PROJECTS COSTS CURRENTLY

01:44:17.284 --> 01:44:20.187 region:rollup2
THE STATE PAYS FOR THE ENTIRE

01:44:18.352 --> 01:44:22.556 region:rollup2
PROJECT BUT THE PROJECT REALLY

01:44:20.187 --> 01:44:23.924 region:rollup2
SERVING PARA UNIVERSITY. OF NOT

01:44:22.556 --> 01:44:26.193 region:rollup2
JUST THE GENERAL CAMPUS BUT ALSO

01:44:23.924 --> 01:44:27.428 region:rollup2
THE HOSPITAL'S OTHER SORT OF

01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:28.262 region:rollup2
AUXILIARY SYSTEMS OF THE OF THE

01:44:27.428 --> 01:44:30.131 region:rollup2
ON.

01:44:28.262 --> 01:44:30.831 region:rollup2
OF THE SYSTEM SO WE RECOMMEND

01:44:30.131 --> 01:44:32.800 region:rollup2
ADOPTING A.

01:44:30.831 --> 01:44:34.034 region:rollup2
CENTER POLICY TO SHARE THE COST

01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:35.236 region:rollup2
BETWEEN OF THE STATE AND NON

01:44:34.034 --> 01:44:35.736 region:rollup2
STATE FUNCTIONS OF THE

01:44:35.236 --> 01:44:36.804 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY WE HAVE A FEW

01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:38.172 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS ON THAT IF IF YOU'D

01:44:36.804 --> 01:44:39.774 region:rollup2
LIKE TO EXPORT THAT FURTHER.

01:44:38.172 --> 01:44:40.941 region:rollup2
WILL ALSO REMAIN CONCERNED OF

01:44:39.774 --> 01:44:42.209 region:rollup2
LONG TERM WITH THE PROJECT SORT

01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:43.644 region:rollup2
OF ESCALATING COSTS

01:44:42.209 --> 01:44:44.512 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER

01:44:43.644 --> 01:44:45.412 region:rollup2
ACTION YOU TAKE BUT YOU CONTINUE

01:44:44.512 --> 01:44:46.847 region:rollup2
TO MONITOR THE PROGRAM

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:47.681 region:rollup2
VIGOROUSLY CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:49.316 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT HEARINGS TO ENSURE

01:44:47.681 --> 01:44:50.684 region:rollup2
THAT. COSTS ARE JUSTIFIED AND

01:44:49.316 --> 01:44:51.252 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE SAVINGS ARE BEING

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:52.853 region:rollup2
PRODUCED AS A RESULT OF THE

01:44:51.252 --> 01:44:53.921 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:44:52.853 --> 01:44:54.522 region:rollup2
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER

01:44:53.921 --> 01:44:55.523 region:rollup2

THEY MAKE THESE DETERMINATIONS

02:07:33.746 --> 02:07:37.083 region:rollup2

02:07:35.314 --> 02:07:38.284 region:rollup2
SAYING PRESERVING. ALL THAT DATA

02:07:37.083 --> 02:07:39.752 region:rollup2

FIVE TERABYTES IN THAT METHOD

02:08:07.713 --> 02:08:09.715 region:rollup2
MAKES SENSE TO US IT SEEMS LIKE

02:08:08.948 --> 02:08:10.850 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD BE TWENTY FIVE

02:08:09.715 --> 02:08:11.951 region:rollup2

THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO

02:09:25.524 --> 02:09:28.227 region:rollup2

02:09:27.393 --> 02:09:30.296 region:rollup2
DISTINCTLY.

02:09:28.227 --> 02:09:31.564 region:rollup2
DESCRIBES A PROPOSAL AND IN THE

02:09:30.296 --> 02:09:32.531 region:rollup2
INTEREST OF TIME I WILL BE VERY

02:09:31.564 --> 02:09:33.866 region:rollup2
BRIEF.

02:09:32.531 --> 02:09:35.868 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSAL SIMPLY TO

02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:37.637 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE A SUNSET OF EXISTING

02:09:35.868 --> 02:09:39.538 region:rollup2
LAW OF IT VERY NARROWLY AND

02:09:37.637 --> 02:09:41.007 region:rollup2
DISCREETLY CRAFTED LAW. THAT'S

02:09:39.538 --> 02:09:48.381 region:rollup2
IN PLACE SINCE TWO THOUSAND

02:09:41.007 --> 02:09:56.455 region:rollup2
ELEVEN. THE LAW ONLY DEALS WITH

02:09:48.381 --> 02:09:56.956 region:rollup2
WHEN A LIBRARY.

02:09:56.455 --> 02:09:59.225 region:rollup2
PACKED WITH A FOR PROFIT

02:09:56.956 --> 02:10:00.893 region:rollup2
COMPANY.

02:09:59.225 --> 02:10:02.294 region:rollup2
THIS LAW HAS BEEN WORKING VERY

02:10:00.893 --> 02:10:03.362 region:rollup2
WELL SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN

02:10:02.294 --> 02:10:05.765 region:rollup2
AND HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL

02:10:03.362 --> 02:10:06.265 region:rollup2
PROTECTING TAX DOLLARS.

02:10:05.765 --> 02:10:07.366 region:rollup2
IT ALSO ENSURES THAT THE

02:10:06.265 --> 02:10:09.969 region:rollup2
LIBRARY.

02:10:07.366 --> 02:10:11.470 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND WORK IS CONNECTED TO

02:10:09.969 --> 02:10:12.705 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND NOT A COMPACT

02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:14.373 region:rollup2
COMMODITY.

02:10:12.705 --> 02:10:15.741 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THE LIBRARY SERVICE

02:10:14.373 --> 02:10:17.543 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT BE COVERED BY A

02:10:15.741 --> 02:10:19.945 region:rollup2
PROFIT MARGIN. AND THAT THIS

02:10:17.543 --> 02:10:20.146 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL WILL IN FACT ENSURE

02:10:19.945 --> 02:10:22.381 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:10:20.146 --> 02:10:23.749 region:rollup2
.

02:10:22.381 --> 02:10:24.950 region:rollup2
IT THAT ELIMINATING THE SENSIBLE

02:10:23.749 --> 02:10:27.720 region:rollup2
FACT ENSURE THAT OUR FREE

02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:29.455 region:rollup2
LIBRARY SYSTEM IN FACT REMAINS

02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:30.089 region:rollup2
FREE FOR ALL WHO USE IT. ON WE

02:10:29.455 --> 02:10:32.658 region:rollup2
ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK

THANK YOU.

02:10:36.796 --> 02:10:55.181 region:rollup2
THAT BRINGS US TO ISSUE NINE.

02:10:53.546 --> 02:10:56.582 region:rollup2
JEFF WHAT PART FINANCE UP THE

02:10:55.181 --> 02:10:58.551 region:rollup2
MIRAGE CONTAINS TWO PROPOSALS

02:10:56.582 --> 02:11:00.286 region:rollup2
RELATING HE'S HE HASTINGS

COLLEGE OF LAW.

02:11:00.286 --> 02:11:05.157 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS ONE POINT FIVE

02:11:03.122 --> 02:11:07.293 region:rollup2
MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO

02:11:05.157 --> 02:11:09.528 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

02:11:07.293 --> 02:11:11.530 region:rollup2
THE IDC HASTINGS I EFFORTS TO

02:11:09.528 --> 02:11:13.466 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THE UC PATH PROJECT ON

02:11:11.530 --> 02:11:15.434 region:rollup2
ITS CAMPUS.

02:11:13.466 --> 02:11:17.436 region:rollup2
AND THE SECOND IS ONE MILLION

02:11:15.434 --> 02:11:18.637 region:rollup2
DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONE TIME

ABOUT OPEN ANY QUESTIONS.

02:11:24.944 --> 02:11:28.681 region:rollup2
BUT PAGE SEVENTEEN OF YOUR

02:11:26.545 --> 02:11:29.949 region:rollup2
AGENDA LISTS THE TWO PROPOSALS

02:11:28.681 --> 02:11:31.183 region:rollup2
JUST FOR YOUR BENEFIT O. TIENEN

YOUR AGENDA.

02:11:33.219 --> 02:11:35.321 region:rollup2
WE HAVE CONCERNS OF BOTH PUZZLES

02:11:34.353 --> 02:11:36.822 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO WALK THROUGH THEM

02:11:35.321 --> 02:11:38.391 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMMITTEE.

02:11:36.822 --> 02:11:39.992 region:rollup2
ON THE FIRST ISSUE OF THE ONE

02:11:38.391 --> 02:11:41.927 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO TO

02:11:39.992 --> 02:11:43.629 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND.

02:11:41.927 --> 02:11:45.598 region:rollup2
BUT HE'S THINGS IS REPORTING

02:11:43.629 --> 02:11:47.867 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS IN THE PROCESS OF.

02:11:45.598 --> 02:11:50.369 region:rollup2
.

02:11:47.867 --> 02:11:51.370 region:rollup2
ALIGNING ITS HUMAN RESOURCES

02:11:50.369 --> 02:11:52.772 region:rollup2
PROCESSES WITH A THE UC PATH

02:11:51.370 --> 02:11:54.473 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN A

02:11:52.772 --> 02:11:57.076 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS ITEM. YOU SEE CURRENTLY

02:11:54.473 --> 02:11:57.977 region:rollup2
USES UC'S EXISTING LEGACY SYSTEM

02:11:57.076 --> 02:12:00.012 region:rollup2
USES IT BURT AND HEADING TO

02:11:57.977 --> 02:12:01.514 region:rollup2
RETIRE THE LEGACY SYSTEM AROUND

02:12:00.012 --> 02:12:02.114 region:rollup2
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY.

02:12:01.514 --> 02:12:04.150 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE OF THAT HE SINGS

02:12:02.114 --> 02:12:05.785 region:rollup2
HOUSE TO WORK TO IMPROVE IT TO.

02:12:04.150 --> 02:12:08.220 region:rollup2
ALIGN ITS CURRENT PROCESSES

02:12:05.785 --> 02:12:10.656 region:rollup2
WITH THE NEW SYSTEM.

02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:11.857 region:rollup2
A HASTINGS OF AND IT ARGUES THAT

02:12:10.656 --> 02:12:13.526 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT

02:12:11.857 --> 02:12:15.060 region:rollup2
FROM THE OTHER UC CAMPUSES IT

02:12:13.526 --> 02:12:16.796 region:rollup2
HAS A LOT MORE WORK TO DO THAN

02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:19.231 region:rollup2
THE OTHER A UC CAMPUSES SUCH

02:12:16.796 --> 02:12:20.833 region:rollup2
THAT. ON ME REQUIRES

02:12:19.231 --> 02:12:23.068 region:rollup2
SORT OF ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD THAT

02:12:20.833 --> 02:12:23.669 region:rollup2
MAYBE A TYPICAL CAMPUS MIGHT.

02:12:23.068 --> 02:12:25.504 region:rollup2
AND.

02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:26.605 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT THEY'RE ASKING FOR

02:12:25.504 --> 02:12:28.808 region:rollup2
AN AUGMENTATION TO WORK TO THAT.

02:12:26.605 --> 02:12:30.443 region:rollup2
.

02:12:28.808 --> 02:12:32.511 region:rollup2
YEAH ALIGNMENT MOST ABOUT

02:12:30.443 --> 02:12:33.512 region:rollup2
FUNDING WOULD BE FOR OF

02:12:32.511 --> 02:12:34.680 region:rollup2
CONSULTANTS OBSERVE MANAGE THAT

02:12:33.512 --> 02:12:36.182 region:rollup2
AND AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL

02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:38.250 region:rollup2
FUNDING LARGELY FOR ADDITIONAL

02:12:36.182 --> 02:12:39.752 region:rollup2
TIME TO TO WORK TOWARDS THAT.

02:12:38.250 --> 02:12:41.020 region:rollup2
WE TO OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT

02:12:39.752 --> 02:12:42.788 region:rollup2
YOU'RE RECEIVING THIS TO A CLOSE

02:12:41.020 --> 02:12:43.255 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET CLOSE OUT EASY PATH

02:12:42.788 --> 02:12:44.623 region:rollup2
WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

02:12:43.255 --> 02:12:46.292 region:rollup2
INITIALLY.

02:12:44.623 --> 02:12:47.626 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED IN TWENTY ELEVEN BY

02:12:46.292 --> 02:12:48.961 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN PLANNING

02:12:47.626 --> 02:12:50.563 region:rollup2
THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS WE

02:12:48.961 --> 02:12:51.864 region:rollup2
QUESTION WHY THE LAW SCHOOL

02:12:50.563 --> 02:12:54.166 region:rollup2
DIDN'T PLAN FOR THE SOONER.

02:12:51.864 --> 02:12:56.368 region:rollup2
AND MORE GRADUALLY AND WHITES

02:12:54.166 --> 02:12:57.570 region:rollup2
COMING TO THE STATE NOW OF SOAP.

02:12:56.368 --> 02:12:59.071 region:rollup2
SO CLOSE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION

02:12:57.570 --> 02:13:00.306 region:rollup2
OF YOU SEE PATH WILL ALSO

02:12:59.071 --> 02:13:01.874 region:rollup2
QUESTION WHY DIDN'T COME TO THE

02:13:00.306 --> 02:13:02.074 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IN JANUARY OF THIS

02:13:01.874 --> 02:13:04.476 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:13:02.074 --> 02:13:05.144 region:rollup2
.

02:13:04.476 --> 02:13:06.645 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS WAS SUCH

02:13:05.144 --> 02:13:07.379 region:rollup2
AS TO NOTABLE CHALLENGE AND

02:13:06.645 --> 02:13:07.880 region:rollup2
WHITES COMING SO CLOSE THE

02:13:07.379 --> 02:13:09.181 region:rollup2
BUDGET BECAUSE THAT'S WE

02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:10.483 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND YOU YOU GET CLARITY ON

02:13:09.181 --> 02:13:11.083 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO ISSUES.

02:13:10.483 --> 02:13:12.451 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:13:11.083 --> 02:13:14.753 region:rollup2
SATISFIED BY CLARITY REJECT THIS

02:13:12.451 --> 02:13:16.055 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

02:13:14.753 --> 02:13:17.790 region:rollup2
ON THE SECOND ISSUE FOR DEFERRED

02:13:16.055 --> 02:13:19.191 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE OUR CONCERN HERE IS

02:13:17.790 --> 02:13:20.559 region:rollup2
THAT THE LAW SCHOOL HASN'T YET

02:13:19.191 --> 02:13:21.694 region:rollup2
SUBMITTED A LIST OF PROJECTS

02:13:20.559 --> 02:13:23.529 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD LIKE TO.

02:13:21.694 --> 02:13:24.830 region:rollup2
USE THE FUNDING FOR.

02:13:23.529 --> 02:13:26.265 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK OF THE LIST IS

02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:27.600 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR

02:13:26.265 --> 02:13:28.701 region:rollup2
HASTINGS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WHERE

02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:30.536 region:rollup2
THERE IS A CURRENT SIZE OF ITS

02:13:28.701 --> 02:13:32.371 region:rollup2
BACKLOGS IS UNKNOWN.

02:13:30.536 --> 02:13:34.139 region:rollup2
ON UNLIKE UC AND CSU HASTINGS IS

02:13:32.371 --> 02:13:36.742 region:rollup2
A RELATIVELY SMALLER US SCHOOL

02:13:34.139 --> 02:13:38.110 region:rollup2
HAS TO FACILITIES BASICALLY OR

02:13:36.742 --> 02:13:39.245 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE FACILITIES IS

02:13:38.110 --> 02:13:41.180 region:rollup2
SCHEDULED TO BE REPLACED BY A
